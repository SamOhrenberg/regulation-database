[00:14.920 --> 00:17.560]  Hello and welco- God damn it.
[00:18.340 --> 00:20.780]  Why did- Why-
[00:20.780 --> 00:22.980]  Oh, I just added a second track.
[00:23.480 --> 00:24.040]  Fuck.
[00:24.380 --> 00:25.620]  Wait a second, stop.
[00:26.200 --> 00:28.000]  Eric said action and I went.
[00:28.300 --> 00:29.660]  And you double actioned.
[00:29.900 --> 00:32.460]  Why is it giving me two tracks all of a sudden?
[00:32.820 --> 00:34.000]  Every time I hit record.
[00:34.180 --> 00:35.920]  This sucks.
[00:36.820 --> 00:37.780]  This sucks.
[00:38.440 --> 00:39.360]  There we go.
[00:39.360 --> 00:40.880]  Okay, I'm back.
[00:41.120 --> 00:42.220]  I'm back, I'm good.
[00:43.020 --> 00:43.900]  Hello and welcome to-
[00:43.900 --> 00:45.420]  And the ICO has gone on.
[00:46.720 --> 00:48.220]  Oh, no it hasn't, stop.
[00:48.760 --> 00:51.420]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the
[00:51.420 --> 00:52.760]  F*** Face Podcast.
[00:53.440 --> 00:54.560]  This is the intro.
[00:55.140 --> 00:55.860]  It's brutal.
[00:56.600 --> 00:58.660]  This is episode 127, my name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:59.080 --> 01:00.040]  With me as always,
[01:00.920 --> 01:02.780]  the other ones, Andrew and Gavin.
[01:03.160 --> 01:03.340]  Hello.
[01:04.260 --> 01:07.180]  First off, let me just start off
[01:07.180 --> 01:08.940]  this podcast this week by
[01:08.940 --> 01:11.500]  taking full responsibility for
[01:12.180 --> 01:13.420]  missing the pizza
[01:13.420 --> 01:14.600]  lunch and
[01:15.380 --> 01:17.300]  I don't even remember if we were supposed to record a
[01:17.300 --> 01:18.020]  monkey movie or not.
[01:18.640 --> 01:21.600]  I tried to sneak
[01:21.600 --> 01:23.380]  in, I didn't tell you guys
[01:23.380 --> 01:25.080]  about it in advance, I realized.
[01:25.200 --> 01:26.160]  I didn't really think about it.
[01:27.100 --> 01:29.160]  I had what I thought was going to be
[01:29.160 --> 01:31.060]  a very minor little oral
[01:31.060 --> 01:32.520]  surgery and
[01:33.180 --> 01:34.960]  I was not prepared
[01:34.960 --> 01:35.660]  for
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.200]  the equivalent of 20 root canals
[01:39.200 --> 01:41.020]  in my mouth at once, that it
[01:41.020 --> 01:41.620]  turned out to be.
[01:42.200 --> 01:44.760]  I could not believe when you
[01:44.760 --> 01:46.180]  text a picture.
[01:46.940 --> 01:48.720]  And I can't believe you didn't walk away.
[01:48.860 --> 01:50.040]  I thought that was what was going to happen.
[01:51.380 --> 01:52.980]  Well, the podcast isn't
[01:52.980 --> 01:53.560]  over yet today.
[01:54.960 --> 01:56.240]  Wait, there's a photo?
[01:56.820 --> 01:58.660]  Yeah, I'll put it up in the
[01:58.660 --> 01:59.820]  Discord right now.
[02:00.480 --> 02:02.880]  This is a photo I sent Gavin right after
[02:02.880 --> 02:04.320]  the surgery. It's just me in bed.
[02:04.420 --> 02:05.180]  Oh my god!
[02:06.780 --> 02:07.880]  That's not good!
[02:08.340 --> 02:10.820]  It got way worse.
[02:11.700 --> 02:12.740]  It started to swell.
[02:13.100 --> 02:14.520]  What it is is a photo of me in bed
[02:14.520 --> 02:16.680]  and the entire right side of my face
[02:16.680 --> 02:17.500]  looks like a balloon.
[02:18.460 --> 02:20.580]  More near the mouth. It looks like
[02:20.580 --> 02:22.640]  I've got a bunch of golf balls in one side of my mouth.
[02:22.800 --> 02:24.780]  It looks like your face is a bounce
[02:24.780 --> 02:26.640]  house that is starting to inflate.
[02:26.860 --> 02:27.920]  Just the left side.
[02:29.340 --> 02:31.200]  I'm like a Halloween inflatable
[02:32.220 --> 02:33.480]  in somebody's front yard
[02:33.480 --> 02:35.260]  that's 35% of the way inflated.
[02:37.200 --> 02:39.060]  It ended up getting way worse.
[02:39.300 --> 02:40.200]  Way more painful
[02:40.940 --> 02:43.300]  later on. But that laid me up
[02:43.300 --> 02:45.280]  for a lot longer than I anticipated.
[02:48.020 --> 02:49.160]  So, if you'll
[02:49.160 --> 02:51.040]  indulge, I'll just run through that story real fast.
[02:51.120 --> 02:52.060]  I'd love to hear it.
[02:53.520 --> 02:55.160]  First off, who the
[02:55.160 --> 02:57.060]  fuck schedules
[02:58.060 --> 02:59.080]  dentist shit on
[02:59.080 --> 03:01.340]  Saturdays? My periodontist
[03:01.340 --> 03:01.580]  is
[03:03.340 --> 03:04.760]  Machiavellian. I'll say that.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.020]  This dude, he only
[03:07.020 --> 03:08.800]  does surgeries
[03:08.800 --> 03:10.840]  in Austin on Saturdays. I guess he does like
[03:10.840 --> 03:13.200]  Round Rock and Cedar Park or Kyle
[03:13.200 --> 03:15.120]  the surrounding areas the rest
[03:15.120 --> 03:16.760]  of the week. But he only makes time
[03:16.760 --> 03:19.100]  in Austin on fucking Saturdays.
[03:19.480 --> 03:20.960]  So, in June
[03:20.960 --> 03:22.820]  I don't even think I mentioned this to you guys then.
[03:23.100 --> 03:25.220]  In June, I went on a Saturday
[03:25.760 --> 03:26.460]  and I
[03:27.020 --> 03:28.000]  went and had a
[03:28.000 --> 03:28.960]  consultation with him.
[03:29.720 --> 03:32.260]  I don't know if I've mentioned this to you guys before, but
[03:32.260 --> 03:34.380]  in addition to all the mouth stuff I have,
[03:34.400 --> 03:35.500]  I have gum problems.
[03:36.540 --> 03:38.160]  My orthodontist and my periodontist
[03:38.160 --> 03:39.860]  both told me that white people have
[03:39.860 --> 03:41.160]  shitty gums on average.
[03:41.800 --> 03:44.220]  So, I'm just working with bad genetics here.
[03:45.060 --> 03:46.460]  So, with all the
[03:47.620 --> 03:48.080]  Invisalign
[03:48.080 --> 03:50.100]  and moving stuff around, and all the
[03:50.100 --> 03:51.480]  surgeries I'd had,
[03:52.100 --> 03:53.880]  my gums had started to recede.
[03:54.320 --> 03:55.800]  It was something I was pretty worried about
[03:55.800 --> 03:57.300]  and I'd been talking about with my dentist a lot.
[03:57.660 --> 03:58.800]  She kept kind of pushing it off.
[03:59.060 --> 03:59.440]  Eventually,
[04:01.620 --> 04:03.720]  I went to the periodontist and he was like,
[04:03.860 --> 04:05.700]  Holy shit, your gums are bad, dude.
[04:05.800 --> 04:07.760]  You need to get this fixed pretty fast.
[04:08.420 --> 04:09.900]  Otherwise, you're going to get bone
[04:10.520 --> 04:11.960]  density loss, and then that's
[04:11.960 --> 04:13.860]  bone grafting. It gets way worse.
[04:15.220 --> 04:15.980]  The problem
[04:15.980 --> 04:16.700]  escalates, right?
[04:18.440 --> 04:19.740]  So, the procedure
[04:19.740 --> 04:22.180]  to get a gum graft
[04:23.100 --> 04:24.320]  and it's going to sound rough
[04:24.720 --> 04:26.440]  but I'll explain why I didn't tell you guys about it.
[04:26.700 --> 04:28.200]  The procedure to get a gum graft is
[04:28.200 --> 04:30.340]  one of two things. Either they remove
[04:30.340 --> 04:32.120]  skin from the roof of your mouth
[04:33.160 --> 04:34.280]  and then they sew
[04:34.280 --> 04:36.460]  it around your teeth and your existing
[04:36.460 --> 04:38.320]  gums to kind of bolster it, kind of beef it up.
[04:38.460 --> 04:39.960]  You know, give you some beefy gums, right?
[04:40.160 --> 04:42.020]  God. However,
[04:42.300 --> 04:44.100]  my gum loss was so
[04:44.100 --> 04:46.160]  severe that when I saw the guy
[04:46.160 --> 04:48.240]  in June, he was like, listen, you're actually
[04:49.080 --> 04:50.220]  he was essentially like,
[04:50.220 --> 04:51.500]  your mouth is so fucked up
[04:52.800 --> 04:54.140]  that you're going to come out of this
[04:54.140 --> 04:56.260]  better. There's no, there's not
[04:56.260 --> 04:58.460]  enough, you don't have enough gums in your head
[04:58.460 --> 05:00.200]  to fix this, so we're going to
[05:00.200 --> 05:02.060]  use a commercial solution. So,
[05:02.160 --> 05:04.400]  basically, if you use, if we use your gums
[05:04.400 --> 05:06.220]  from the roof of your mouth, that's like a two week recovery
[05:06.220 --> 05:08.320]  which, by the way, is bullshit. It is not a two week recovery.
[05:09.600 --> 05:10.240]  If it's,
[05:10.760 --> 05:12.180]  and by the way, if I sound weird at all, it
[05:12.180 --> 05:14.140]  is still hard to talk and my mouth still hurts
[05:14.140 --> 05:16.160]  and it is hard to smile and it hurts to laugh.
[05:16.600 --> 05:18.200]  So, luckily I'm doing the podcast with you guys
[05:18.200 --> 05:20.220]  so that shouldn't be a problem. No laughing
[05:20.220 --> 05:20.480]  here.
[05:21.960 --> 05:24.140]  He goes, so you're, he goes, you need
[05:24.140 --> 05:26.180]  too much gums. So, we're not going to be able to
[05:26.180 --> 05:28.120]  use you. I just love, every time
[05:28.120 --> 05:30.000]  every time you have a, you consult
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.180]  with a doctor or a surgeon, they
[05:32.180 --> 05:34.140]  always lay out like, here's, well,
[05:34.160 --> 05:35.980]  here's what people do. And then they're like, yeah.
[05:36.120 --> 05:38.340]  No, no, no, no, no. That's definitely
[05:38.340 --> 05:40.120]  not for you. Yeah, you're
[05:40.120 --> 05:41.120]  going to have to do for you.
[05:42.160 --> 05:44.320]  You're reminding me of when I had my thumb surgery
[05:44.320 --> 05:45.700]  after I shaved my thumb, yeah, yeah.
[05:46.960 --> 05:47.820]  The doctor was like,
[05:47.900 --> 05:48.900]  oh no, oh no, no.
[05:50.080 --> 05:51.680]  Anyway, so he's like, you know, there's not
[05:51.680 --> 05:53.740]  enough gums in the, you don't have enough, there's not enough
[05:53.740 --> 05:55.680]  gums in your body for you. So, we're going to
[05:55.680 --> 05:57.760]  use a commercial solution. That recovery
[05:57.760 --> 05:59.800]  is only like four days. And I was like, oh really?
[05:59.840 --> 06:01.680]  He goes, yeah, it's basically like, he
[06:01.680 --> 06:03.760]  didn't say where they come from, but they get
[06:03.760 --> 06:05.680]  gums, and I'm assuming they're dead
[06:05.680 --> 06:07.760]  people gums. Yeah. What? This is a
[06:07.760 --> 06:09.720]  whole subplot in Oz, is what you're living.
[06:10.120 --> 06:11.740]  Yeah, okay, cool. I don't remember that part of
[06:11.740 --> 06:13.700]  Oz, but I'm assuming that I'm getting dead people's
[06:13.700 --> 06:15.620]  gums, which is fucking, it's great.
[06:15.940 --> 06:17.820]  What? I've never heard of that in my life.
[06:18.120 --> 06:19.700]  Totally, totally fine with that.
[06:19.900 --> 06:21.720]  They harvest gums? Yeah. Emily and
[06:21.720 --> 06:23.760]  I were like, listen, maybe I'll get some really
[06:23.760 --> 06:25.700]  talented person's gums, maybe I'll learn
[06:25.700 --> 06:27.600]  like, suddenly I can play the, you know, I can play
[06:27.600 --> 06:29.660]  the trumpet, or, like, maybe I'll get evil
[06:29.660 --> 06:31.740]  gums. Who knows, you know, but like, it'll be an adventure
[06:31.740 --> 06:32.720]  one way or the other, right?
[06:33.520 --> 06:35.520]  And, uh, so I didn't really think anything of it.
[06:35.580 --> 06:37.200]  And then, there was a long process
[06:37.760 --> 06:39.700]  from June until last, two weeks ago,
[06:39.760 --> 06:41.600]  where I tried to convince them
[06:41.600 --> 06:42.980]  to let me have this fucking surgery.
[06:43.400 --> 06:45.580]  I just, I was playing phone tag between the orthodontist
[06:45.580 --> 06:47.300]  and the periodontist, and trying to get them together,
[06:47.360 --> 06:49.200]  and there was a whole thing with stopping my Invisalign,
[06:49.380 --> 06:51.560]  which still hasn't been worked out, by the way, I just don't,
[06:51.660 --> 06:53.300]  I'm just not on Invisalign anymore.
[06:53.600 --> 06:55.580]  The orthodontist told me one thing, the periodontist is like,
[06:55.640 --> 06:57.480]  don't listen to him, listen to me. And so,
[06:57.520 --> 06:59.480]  they're like, they're fighting, it's a whole fucking thing.
[07:00.000 --> 07:00.940]  Uh, a lot of drama,
[07:01.440 --> 07:03.460]  a lot of mouth drama, uh,
[07:03.460 --> 07:04.880]  in the periphery. But, um,
[07:05.520 --> 07:07.480]  so anyway, eventually I'm able to get it scheduled.
[07:07.620 --> 07:09.300]  And it was, like, I guess, not last Saturday,
[07:09.300 --> 07:10.020]  but the previous one.
[07:11.240 --> 07:13.740]  And, uh, I just thought,
[07:13.820 --> 07:15.140]  like he said, it's like, it's in,
[07:15.240 --> 07:17.140]  you're gonna be in and out in like an hour, hour and a half.
[07:17.260 --> 07:19.080]  And you're just like, it's gonna suck a little bit,
[07:19.140 --> 07:21.360]  you'll get some shots, you know, cause we gotta sew the gums in,
[07:21.400 --> 07:23.100]  but it's like, it's not the end of the world, right?
[07:23.480 --> 07:25.600]  And so I go in, I have Emily take me,
[07:25.680 --> 07:27.740]  just for the hell of it, even though I think I'm probably fine,
[07:27.800 --> 07:29.920]  I have Emily take me in on Saturday,
[07:30.840 --> 07:31.400]  and, uh,
[07:31.780 --> 07:32.700]  I get in the chair,
[07:34.060 --> 07:35.280]  and he looks at my mouth,
[07:35.320 --> 07:37.320]  and he goes, I think we can do this.
[07:37.320 --> 07:38.360]  And I was like, what?
[07:38.540 --> 07:41.460]  And he goes, I think, I think we can, I think we can,
[07:42.040 --> 07:42.840]  I think we can do this.
[07:42.860 --> 07:43.880]  And I go, so what does that mean?
[07:43.900 --> 07:45.720]  And he goes, I don't think we're gonna use the commercial stuff,
[07:45.800 --> 07:47.220]  I think we're gonna use you for you.
[07:47.320 --> 07:48.440]  And I was like, oh really?
[07:48.540 --> 07:50.840]  He goes, it's gonna be close, but we're gonna see.
[07:51.280 --> 07:51.940]  And I go, no!
[07:53.980 --> 07:55.340]  It's gonna be close?
[07:56.660 --> 07:59.840]  You don't want someone who's about to perform surgery on you
[07:59.840 --> 08:02.120]  ever to state it's going to be close.
[08:02.280 --> 08:03.000]  Let's do this.
[08:03.160 --> 08:03.720]  Strap in.
[08:05.080 --> 08:05.460]  Every...
[08:05.460 --> 08:07.380]  Oh, I should also mention too,
[08:07.780 --> 08:09.720]  that when I got the initial consult, and he told me
[08:09.720 --> 08:11.680]  I was gonna have the easiest version of this,
[08:11.840 --> 08:13.740]  he also said, it's way too much
[08:13.740 --> 08:15.120]  surgery to do in one sitting,
[08:15.460 --> 08:17.760]  so we're gonna split it up. You'll do the top
[08:17.760 --> 08:19.720]  of your mouth, and then three months later
[08:19.720 --> 08:21.540]  we'll come in and do the bottom. Easy peasy,
[08:21.680 --> 08:22.820]  in and out, no big deal.
[08:23.440 --> 08:23.660]  Okay.
[08:25.400 --> 08:27.980]  This guy felt, this guy felt like pushing it.
[08:28.100 --> 08:29.740]  He was like, he wanted to test the limits
[08:29.740 --> 08:31.800]  of his ability and my pain threshold.
[08:31.800 --> 08:33.840]  And so he goes, I think we can do this,
[08:34.160 --> 08:36.220]  I'll get started on the top and we'll just see how it goes.
[08:36.360 --> 08:37.960]  And I go, okay. And then they give me nitrous,
[08:38.120 --> 08:39.860]  and I'm like, the last, I didn't have nitrous for
[08:39.860 --> 08:41.900]  the first three root canals, I had it for the
[08:41.900 --> 08:43.700]  last two, and it's like, I'll be honest with you,
[08:43.900 --> 08:45.620]  the root canals were fine with the nitrous,
[08:45.700 --> 08:48.060]  I was like, oh, nitrous, I'll be fine.
[08:48.340 --> 08:49.720]  You know, the shots will suck,
[08:50.680 --> 08:51.940]  but then my mouth will be numb
[08:51.940 --> 08:52.880]  and I won't think about it.
[08:53.540 --> 08:55.060]  I'll just be like, off in la la land.
[08:55.560 --> 08:56.900]  I found the limits of
[08:57.800 --> 08:59.620]  what nitrous can do for pain. Pretty quickly.
[09:00.600 --> 09:01.680]  Pretty fucking quickly.
[09:02.340 --> 09:03.480]  So we get in there,
[09:03.760 --> 09:05.360]  and first off,
[09:05.560 --> 09:07.480]  I don't know if you guys have had a lot of shots in your mouth.
[09:08.260 --> 09:09.400]  Unfortunately, I have.
[09:09.960 --> 09:11.780]  Especially the last three years or so.
[09:13.000 --> 09:13.640]  I would say
[09:13.640 --> 09:15.860]  I maybe have had more shots in my mouth in the last three years
[09:15.860 --> 09:17.140]  than most people do in a lifetime.
[09:17.580 --> 09:19.940]  You always told me to, when they ask if it's working,
[09:20.080 --> 09:21.600]  you'd say no, and then you'd get another one.
[09:21.940 --> 09:23.940]  Get another shot, it's a minor
[09:23.940 --> 09:25.800]  inconvenience, but it'll pay off in the long run.
[09:27.320 --> 09:28.120]  I don't know
[09:28.120 --> 09:30.300]  if you guys have had shots on the inside
[09:30.300 --> 09:31.040]  of your mouth.
[09:31.580 --> 09:34.420]  It is a whole different world
[09:34.420 --> 09:36.220]  on the other side of your teeth.
[09:36.820 --> 09:37.760]  On the back end,
[09:37.860 --> 09:40.160]  you know, where your tongue and your uvula
[09:40.160 --> 09:41.880]  and the roof of your mouth and all that stuff is,
[09:42.080 --> 09:44.400]  that's a whole different level of pain
[09:44.400 --> 09:46.260]  from the outside, front-facing
[09:46.260 --> 09:47.720]  side of your mouth. The side that gets hit with
[09:48.120 --> 09:50.160]  sun when you open your mouth
[09:50.160 --> 09:52.320]  or hot coffee or cold.
[09:52.480 --> 09:53.940]  It gets resistant to stuff.
[09:54.180 --> 09:56.400]  The inside of your mouth, it's partially protected
[09:56.400 --> 09:58.340]  by the outside of your mouth, so it is not ready
[09:58.340 --> 10:00.480]  for what may
[10:00.480 --> 10:01.580]  have been 20 shots.
[10:02.560 --> 10:03.000]  God!
[10:04.660 --> 10:06.680]  Getting a shot in the roof of my mouth,
[10:07.100 --> 10:08.280]  getting a shot in the
[10:08.280 --> 10:09.660]  floor of my mouth,
[10:11.480 --> 10:12.520]  I just, like,
[10:12.660 --> 10:14.180]  the night just did nothing for that.
[10:14.340 --> 10:16.660]  It was so goddamn painful.
[10:16.920 --> 10:18.200]  To the point where I was just, like,
[10:18.260 --> 10:20.680]  sitting on my hands, I couldn't move.
[10:21.480 --> 10:22.400]  He gets me all
[10:22.400 --> 10:24.520]  numb, and
[10:25.040 --> 10:26.540]  then... Are these shots because
[10:26.540 --> 10:28.040]  he's using you now?
[10:28.360 --> 10:30.440]  Yeah, these are shots to use me.
[10:30.480 --> 10:32.620]  But because you're now using you,
[10:32.980 --> 10:34.900]  you now have to go through all these shots.
[10:35.180 --> 10:36.100]  Yeah, it's extra shots.
[10:36.220 --> 10:37.960]  Did you argue with him?
[10:38.380 --> 10:40.400]  No, listen, he's a fucking...
[10:40.400 --> 10:42.520]  The guy's got a medical degree, I do not. I'm not gonna argue
[10:42.520 --> 10:44.600]  with the guy. Yeah, but this was your chance
[10:44.600 --> 10:46.460]  to be, like, a grandmaster at chess
[10:46.460 --> 10:48.000]  with your gums. Yeah, but I'm not!
[10:48.500 --> 10:50.620]  And I don't for a second think I am.
[10:50.700 --> 10:52.380]  I don't for a second look at a chess board and think,
[10:52.380 --> 10:54.340]  I know this. Much like I don't for a second look
[10:54.340 --> 10:56.420]  at a mouth and think, I have domain. No, but this is like
[10:56.420 --> 10:58.340]  your Like Mike scenario. You're getting the other
[10:58.340 --> 11:00.260]  person's guns, you're losing your ability
[11:00.260 --> 11:02.420]  to absorb talent, is what I'm saying. I can understand
[11:02.420 --> 11:04.460]  wanting to keep your own material.
[11:05.020 --> 11:05.760]  That's fair, too.
[11:06.220 --> 11:08.380]  I feel like they need to explain
[11:08.380 --> 11:10.620]  that you're gonna get a million shots in this trade.
[11:10.780 --> 11:12.260]  I'm bummed at this point
[11:12.260 --> 11:14.540]  because I thought it was... I was taking the easy road
[11:14.540 --> 11:16.360]  and this very quickly, we've taken an
[11:16.360 --> 11:17.460]  off-ramp into
[11:19.000 --> 11:20.460]  what's looking... Like, we're getting pretty far
[11:20.460 --> 11:22.520]  off the interstate here and I'm starting to get a little nervous.
[11:23.040 --> 11:24.420]  It's not well lit on this
[11:24.420 --> 11:26.500]  street we're driving on and it's a little sketchy.
[11:26.620 --> 11:28.280]  And your guide thinks that
[11:28.280 --> 11:30.500]  maybe this will work. Like, not only
[11:30.500 --> 11:32.120]  are you off the road, he's like,
[11:32.460 --> 11:34.400]  probably. He's like, the top half of your
[11:34.400 --> 11:36.300]  mouth is the most fucked up, so that's where we're gonna
[11:36.300 --> 11:37.600]  focus. And I'm like, okay.
[11:39.260 --> 11:39.640]  And
[11:40.400 --> 11:42.380]  so he starts putting the shots in and they're
[11:42.380 --> 11:43.720]  worse than I imagined.
[11:44.080 --> 11:45.820]  And they're really bad.
[11:46.200 --> 11:48.580]  And, you know, the shot
[11:48.580 --> 11:50.840]  makes you numb after the shot.
[11:51.380 --> 11:52.540]  In the area where you already
[11:52.540 --> 11:54.640]  were. So, like, the shot's always
[11:54.640 --> 11:56.560]  one step ahead of the numb, right?
[11:56.680 --> 11:58.360]  So you're still getting the pain every time.
[11:59.600 --> 12:00.320]  And so
[12:00.320 --> 12:02.220]  he gets me all numbed up really good
[12:02.940 --> 12:04.740]  and I'm a little loopy from the nitrous
[12:04.740 --> 12:06.560]  and then he starts
[12:06.560 --> 12:07.900]  he basically
[12:08.560 --> 12:10.680]  flays the... Like, he basically Ramsey
[12:10.680 --> 12:12.860]  Boltons the roof
[12:12.860 --> 12:14.480]  of my mouth. I can just feel like this
[12:14.480 --> 12:16.520]  pressure and then hear him just like
[12:16.520 --> 12:17.980]  scraping with a knife
[12:17.980 --> 12:20.540]  just like strips of skin
[12:20.540 --> 12:22.260]  out. It's the worst thing I've ever heard.
[12:22.360 --> 12:23.980]  It's very uncomfortable, right?
[12:24.160 --> 12:26.340]  Very uncomfortable. And remember, I'm
[12:26.340 --> 12:28.300]  expecting 60 to 90
[12:28.300 --> 12:30.260]  minutes. He said less than an hour and a half, probably an hour and a half.
[12:30.900 --> 12:31.380]  And
[12:32.440 --> 12:33.640]  he does this
[12:33.640 --> 12:35.080]  for two hours.
[12:36.620 --> 12:37.100]  Straight.
[12:38.460 --> 12:40.000]  And I'm telling you
[12:40.680 --> 12:42.280]  there is not enough nitrous
[12:43.400 --> 12:43.880]  and
[12:43.880 --> 12:46.040]  pain med in the world
[12:46.040 --> 12:47.140]  to inject into a person.
[12:47.360 --> 12:50.100]  It was 100% torture.
[12:50.480 --> 12:51.200]  It's torture, yeah.
[12:51.300 --> 12:53.600]  It was literally, I just couldn't move
[12:53.600 --> 12:55.220]  and it was pure torture.
[12:55.660 --> 12:57.560]  And it hurt so bad
[12:57.560 --> 12:59.560]  and then at the end of two hours
[12:59.560 --> 13:01.780]  he pops up for air and he goes
[13:01.780 --> 13:03.640]  Guess what? And I go
[13:03.640 --> 13:05.340]  You know? And he goes
[13:05.340 --> 13:07.140]  We got the top of your mouth totally done.
[13:07.780 --> 13:10.000]  Yeah, I think there's gonna be enough
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.640]  I think there's enough of you left
[13:11.640 --> 13:13.980]  We can do the bottom and get you out of here in one setting.
[13:14.900 --> 13:15.840]  And I'm like
[13:15.840 --> 13:16.640]  Uhhh
[13:16.640 --> 13:18.620]  I want nothing more
[13:18.620 --> 13:21.080]  I want nothing more than to get out of this chair.
[13:21.240 --> 13:23.640]  But I'm thinking I will never get back in this chair again
[13:23.640 --> 13:25.280]  if I get out, right? So I'm like
[13:25.280 --> 13:27.580]  Okay. And he does
[13:27.580 --> 13:29.120]  another hour on the
[13:29.640 --> 13:30.760]  lower half of my mouth.
[13:31.580 --> 13:33.120]  So for three hours
[13:33.720 --> 13:34.160]  he
[13:35.800 --> 13:37.580]  Ramsay boltened the roof of my mouth
[13:37.580 --> 13:39.760]  and then Frankenstein sewed it
[13:39.760 --> 13:41.420]  around my teeth and my gums
[13:41.420 --> 13:42.520]  on the top and the bottom
[13:43.400 --> 13:45.600]  I got out of the chair, I was in a daze
[13:45.600 --> 13:47.920]  I went out, I sat down in the thing
[13:47.920 --> 13:49.620]  next to Emily, she had to fill out some paperwork
[13:49.620 --> 13:51.620]  and I'll be honest with you, in the waiting room
[13:51.620 --> 13:54.000]  in front of 15 people, I just started crying.
[13:55.000 --> 13:56.040]  I was just like
[13:56.040 --> 13:57.700]  I was shaken uncontrollably
[13:57.700 --> 13:59.900]  and I just, I was such a
[13:59.900 --> 14:00.140]  like
[14:01.320 --> 14:03.080]  It's kinda like when you, I don't know if you guys, well
[14:03.720 --> 14:05.100]  none of you here have, I don't think
[14:05.100 --> 14:07.800]  but if you've ever had a tattoo and it's gone
[14:07.800 --> 14:09.820]  and it gets into like the 4, the 5, the 6
[14:09.820 --> 14:11.860]  hour range, you start to just like kinda lose
[14:11.860 --> 14:13.860]  a little bit of control, you start to get real shaky
[14:13.860 --> 14:15.760]  you get real lightheaded, you just like
[14:15.760 --> 14:17.700]  you just kinda start to feel out of it. I felt like that
[14:17.700 --> 14:19.760]  and I just sat there and cried until
[14:19.760 --> 14:21.800]  Emily took me home and then put
[14:21.800 --> 14:23.840]  a bunch of hydrocodone in me and put me to bed
[14:23.840 --> 14:25.780]  and then I woke up and I took that picture of my face
[14:25.780 --> 14:26.780]  that I sent you guys
[14:27.560 --> 14:28.200]  and uh
[14:29.240 --> 14:31.760]  and then my face ballooned up, like it got way worse
[14:31.760 --> 14:33.780]  than that and it was just like constant
[14:34.420 --> 14:35.060]  constant pain
[14:35.940 --> 14:37.220]  and in ways
[14:37.220 --> 14:38.800]  that I just hadn't anticipated
[14:38.800 --> 14:41.360]  cause I thought this thing was gonna be 60 minutes
[14:41.360 --> 14:43.140]  somebody else's gums
[14:43.140 --> 14:45.280]  in and out, it was 3 hours, it was
[14:45.280 --> 14:47.280]  torture, the roof of my
[14:47.280 --> 14:49.020]  mouth is still so
[14:50.020 --> 14:50.980]  sucks so
[14:50.980 --> 14:53.000]  fucking bad, even though it's now
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.660]  2 weeks past, it'll be 2 weeks Saturday
[14:54.660 --> 14:56.880]  uh, it's like the
[14:56.880 --> 14:58.960]  surface of the moon, like there are
[14:58.960 --> 15:01.020]  rocks and crags and hills and valleys
[15:01.020 --> 15:02.980]  in the roof of my mouth and they all just
[15:02.980 --> 15:04.940]  burn and itch from growing
[15:04.940 --> 15:06.940]  back and I can't, it's one of those things
[15:06.940 --> 15:08.980]  where if you touch it, it hurts, but it itches so you have to
[15:08.980 --> 15:11.140]  touch it, and so I'm just constantly fighting with myself
[15:11.140 --> 15:13.020]  uh, but anyway, so we get through
[15:13.020 --> 15:14.960]  all that and then I'm just a swollen
[15:14.960 --> 15:17.000]  mess for days and days and days and I thought I was
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.980]  gonna be clean in the pizza oven and all this stuff, I can't
[15:18.980 --> 15:20.960]  get out of bed. Then as the swelling
[15:20.960 --> 15:23.200]  subsides, the second hell visits
[15:23.200 --> 15:24.880]  me, which I wasn't anticipating
[15:25.920 --> 15:26.640]  the swelling
[15:27.980 --> 15:29.320]  obscured all of
[15:29.320 --> 15:31.080]  the hun- well, it's probably
[15:31.080 --> 15:32.800]  30 stitches
[15:33.340 --> 15:34.680]  the pokey stitches
[15:34.680 --> 15:37.560]  once the swelling subsides, the stitches
[15:37.560 --> 15:38.960]  appear like a porcupine
[15:38.960 --> 15:41.040]  my mouth has been a goddamn
[15:41.040 --> 15:43.020]  it's like, it's just been like needles
[15:43.020 --> 15:45.360]  sticking out from between every tooth
[15:45.360 --> 15:46.720]  in my mouth for the last week.
[15:46.800 --> 15:48.920]  I can't not touch them
[15:48.920 --> 15:51.240]  yeah, I'm Edward Scissortooth, I can't not brush
[15:51.240 --> 15:53.360]  against them with my teeth, there are certain ones
[15:53.360 --> 15:55.200]  especially in the top where he was really hammering
[15:55.200 --> 15:57.300]  away where it was bad, it just, it's so
[15:57.300 --> 15:59.300]  it's so 24 hour
[15:59.300 --> 16:00.740]  a day uncomfortable, and
[16:01.260 --> 16:03.500]  I'm too- the stitches
[16:03.500 --> 16:04.960]  are supposed to dissolve at two weeks
[16:04.960 --> 16:07.560]  I'm pretty much two weeks in, they're going strong
[16:07.560 --> 16:09.160]  they're just as annoying and painful
[16:09.160 --> 16:10.740]  as ever, and I
[16:11.140 --> 16:13.180]  and I just- so that's where I've been
[16:13.180 --> 16:15.280]  I had this- I tried to sneak a really
[16:15.280 --> 16:17.320]  easy medical procedure in, I didn't think it was
[16:17.320 --> 16:19.320]  gonna be a big deal, I wasn't even gonna bring it up to
[16:19.320 --> 16:21.220]  you guys because I get- I'm sick of talking
[16:21.220 --> 16:23.280]  about my mouth, and the dental
[16:23.280 --> 16:25.340]  stuff, and I thought I was past it, I thought
[16:25.340 --> 16:27.140]  this was one minor little blip
[16:27.640 --> 16:29.300]  oh, and then the last thing he said to me
[16:29.300 --> 16:31.280]  which is so fucking terrifying, and I still
[16:31.280 --> 16:32.820]  don't know what to think about it, he goes, he goes
[16:32.820 --> 16:35.060]  it looks good, right now, you're at 100%
[16:35.060 --> 16:37.220]  come back in a month, maybe 100%
[16:37.220 --> 16:39.080]  maybe 80, maybe 60, we'll see, and I'm like
[16:39.080 --> 16:41.180]  I don't know what that means, but I was in no condition
[16:41.180 --> 16:43.160]  to ask, so I don't know if I'm supposed to have, like
[16:43.160 --> 16:45.360]  if there's a fear that I'll shed extra
[16:45.360 --> 16:47.040]  gums out and then I'll have to put them back in
[16:47.040 --> 16:49.120]  or they'll shrink over time, or
[16:49.120 --> 16:51.040]  whatever, but I go back in like two weeks
[16:51.040 --> 16:53.300]  I go back in like- yeah, I don't know
[16:53.300 --> 16:55.020]  I go back in like two weeks to see how
[16:55.020 --> 16:56.600]  I've healed, but um
[16:56.600 --> 16:58.980]  but my mouth is just like, it's like a torture
[16:58.980 --> 17:00.660]  device right now, and I'm two weeks in
[17:00.660 --> 17:03.100]  I can't eat anything- I actually had a hamburger yesterday
[17:03.100 --> 17:05.200]  it was the first time I'd eaten, like, kind of food like that
[17:05.200 --> 17:07.240]  and it was hard. I've been eating soup
[17:07.240 --> 17:09.460]  and oatmeal and applesauce
[17:09.460 --> 17:11.100]  for two straight weeks
[17:11.100 --> 17:12.740]  I- every time
[17:12.740 --> 17:14.540]  I eat a Red Baron pizza
[17:14.540 --> 17:16.380]  I cut the roof of my mouth
[17:16.900 --> 17:17.720]  I didn't mean to
[17:17.720 --> 17:21.220]  Oh, what a struggle for you
[17:21.220 --> 17:21.980]  No, I'm just saying
[17:21.980 --> 17:23.540]  I'm so sad
[17:23.540 --> 17:25.340]  every time
[17:25.340 --> 17:27.220]  You're right, you don't think about how much stuff
[17:27.680 --> 17:28.780]  fucks up the roof of your mouth
[17:28.780 --> 17:31.400]  It just digs out a little bit, nicks it to the point where it's like
[17:32.360 --> 17:34.120]  dislodged a little bit of roof skin
[17:34.120 --> 17:35.900]  and it's
[17:35.900 --> 17:38.060]  so uncomfortable and irritating
[17:38.060 --> 17:39.380]  for like two or three days
[17:39.380 --> 17:41.240]  I cannot imagine
[17:41.700 --> 17:42.980]  all of that- I can't
[17:42.980 --> 17:46.200]  I hate that story so much, it sounds horrendous
[17:46.200 --> 17:48.000]  I can't believe you're not addicted to
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.340]  opiates on painkillers
[17:49.340 --> 17:51.380]  No, no, no, I mean I didn't even
[17:51.380 --> 17:53.400]  finish the pain meds they gave me, I've just been
[17:53.400 --> 17:55.000]  I don't like the foggy feeling
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.380]  so, um, and you know
[17:57.380 --> 17:59.480]  I have addiction issues so I try to be on top
[17:59.480 --> 18:00.340]  of that, but um
[18:01.060 --> 18:03.120]  but no, I've been taking a lot of ibuprofen
[18:03.680 --> 18:05.520]  The worst fucking thing is there's a couple
[18:05.520 --> 18:07.340]  on the- well the worst is the top, but there's a
[18:07.340 --> 18:09.460]  couple on the bottom where my tongue like naturally
[18:09.460 --> 18:11.500]  rests, where like I can't help
[18:11.500 --> 18:13.160]  but touch the stitch in the back
[18:13.160 --> 18:15.400]  and I can feel it move the stitch in the front
[18:15.400 --> 18:16.720]  on my lip, you know what I mean?
[18:16.720 --> 18:19.060]  So it's weird to like touch the back of your mouth
[18:19.060 --> 18:20.500]  and have it manipulate the front of your mouth
[18:20.500 --> 18:21.180]  It's all connected
[18:23.380 --> 18:24.180]  Fucking sucks
[18:24.780 --> 18:26.680]  Sucks so fucking bad
[18:26.680 --> 18:28.020]  And you didn't walk away after that?
[18:28.020 --> 18:28.820]  It's been such a fucking nightmare
[18:29.640 --> 18:31.140]  Well, I'm in no condition to walk
[18:33.620 --> 18:34.580]  That is a great
[18:34.580 --> 18:36.780]  Outside of the mouth, do you have any other issues
[18:36.780 --> 18:38.660]  going on? Are your legs better? Your ankles?
[18:38.780 --> 18:40.280]  What's going on with the overall body?
[18:40.540 --> 18:41.520]  How's the crutch staying?
[18:41.940 --> 18:44.720]  I think the- I don't wanna jinx myself, but I think
[18:44.720 --> 18:47.000]  the- I think I've stopped taking
[18:47.380 --> 18:48.260]  jock itch medicine
[18:48.860 --> 18:50.740]  Great. I think I'm okay
[18:50.740 --> 18:52.720]  there. I have no
[18:52.720 --> 18:54.760]  idea of the condition of my Invisalign because I can't
[18:54.760 --> 18:56.480]  put them back in for at least another two weeks
[18:58.320 --> 18:58.680]  My
[18:58.680 --> 19:00.780]  finger is 100% I'm pretty sure it's broken
[19:00.780 --> 19:02.440]  I just try not to use it and touch it
[19:02.440 --> 19:04.460]  because I just don't have the energy to deal with it
[19:05.740 --> 19:06.620]  Everything else is fine
[19:07.040 --> 19:08.600]  My ankle's a little stiff here and there
[19:08.600 --> 19:10.760]  but it's gotten way better since
[19:10.760 --> 19:12.700]  I think I saw you guys last or talked to you guys last
[19:12.700 --> 19:14.440]  The rest of my body is fine
[19:14.440 --> 19:16.680]  it's just my mouth continues to persist
[19:16.680 --> 19:17.620]  to be an issue

[20:33.190 --> 20:35.070]  but just in case you have any
[20:35.070 --> 20:37.170]  friends that do, you'll want
[20:37.170 --> 20:38.950]  to pay attention to this. With
[20:38.950 --> 20:40.730]  everything going on in the world, governments
[20:40.730 --> 20:43.010]  have increased their surveillance. They're using
[20:43.010 --> 20:44.770]  your devices to track your location
[20:44.770 --> 20:46.950]  movements, and in many countries
[20:46.950 --> 20:48.970]  your internet activity. You don't
[20:48.970 --> 20:50.810]  want to be literally caught with your
[20:50.810 --> 20:52.850]  pants, shorts, or trunks. What's the difference
[20:52.850 --> 20:54.790]  between pants or trunks? Are they the same?
[20:55.130 --> 20:56.530]  I have no idea. Either way
[20:56.530 --> 20:58.570]  you do not want to get caught with them down
[20:58.570 --> 21:00.850]  and one of the best ways to keep your online browsing
[21:00.850 --> 21:02.890]  activity private is by using Express
[21:02.890 --> 21:04.830]  VPN. When you use Express
[21:04.830 --> 21:06.950]  VPN, your internet connection is
[21:06.950 --> 21:09.050]  rerouted through a secure, encrypted
[21:09.050 --> 21:10.830]  server so you can surf the web
[21:10.830 --> 21:12.890]  anonymously without anyone looking over
[21:12.890 --> 21:14.830]  your shoulder. Look, I know you
[21:14.830 --> 21:16.770]  probably think all you have to do is use
[21:16.770 --> 21:18.850]  incognito mode and no one can see that you've watched
[21:18.850 --> 21:21.210]  every last hentai video on Pornhub
[21:21.210 --> 21:22.230]  but you're wrong!
[21:22.790 --> 21:24.810]  Even when you use incognito mode, your
[21:24.810 --> 21:27.190]  internet provider like Verizon or AT&T
[21:27.190 --> 21:28.790]  can see every single
[21:28.790 --> 21:30.770]  website you visit. And if you live on
[21:30.770 --> 21:32.530]  campus or use a shared wifi
[21:32.530 --> 21:34.550]  your network admin can too.
[21:34.550 --> 21:36.750]  To be honest, that's kinda scary.
[21:37.110 --> 21:38.490]  That's why I use Express
[21:38.490 --> 21:40.430]  VPN whenever I go online and I
[21:40.430 --> 21:42.330]  recommend all of you do the same.
[21:42.730 --> 21:44.610]  Without Express VPN, you're giving
[21:44.610 --> 21:46.670]  people a free license to peek over your
[21:46.670 --> 21:48.530]  shoulder and see all the freaky shit you're
[21:48.530 --> 21:50.530]  looking at. So protect your
[21:50.530 --> 21:52.530]  privacy today and get

[23:21.190 --> 23:23.010]  And then I think the last thing I was
[23:23.010 --> 23:24.870]  going to talk about... we don't have to... we can cover
[23:24.870 --> 23:26.310]  it today. I kind of f***ed my
[23:27.430 --> 23:28.230]  proposal to
[23:28.230 --> 23:30.410]  Emily and then we are all supposed to
[23:30.410 --> 23:31.770]  have Icy Hot.
[23:32.170 --> 23:34.290]  I don't know if you guys want to do that this week
[23:34.290 --> 23:35.530]  or we just push it to a week.
[23:35.770 --> 23:38.350]  Well, here's the thing with that. I started
[23:38.350 --> 23:40.530]  Googling. Like, should you put...
[23:40.530 --> 23:42.270]  Like, what happens if you put Icy Hot on your junk?
[23:42.790 --> 23:44.350]  And it's just horror
[23:44.350 --> 23:45.770]  story after horror story.
[23:46.370 --> 23:47.430]  I don't know what you're expecting.
[23:47.790 --> 23:50.330]  The episode where we discussed it hasn't come
[23:50.330 --> 23:52.590]  out yet. So I don't know the audience's thoughts on...
[23:52.590 --> 23:54.450]  I assume we're going to get bombarded with
[23:54.450 --> 23:55.850]  don't do that, don't do that.
[23:56.370 --> 23:57.990]  It honestly scared me.
[23:58.110 --> 24:00.570]  It scared me. It's a terrible idea.
[24:00.890 --> 24:02.310]  Can I talk about
[24:02.310 --> 24:04.390]  some of my Icy Hot experience? Because I've never
[24:04.390 --> 24:06.270]  had Icy Hot or Tiger Bomb
[24:06.270 --> 24:08.590]  around me. And it has been a time.
[24:08.690 --> 24:10.590]  I've learned that I shouldn't
[24:10.590 --> 24:12.330]  be allowed to have it in my possession.
[24:12.470 --> 24:14.390]  Has been essentially the arc of the
[24:14.390 --> 24:16.470]  last time we talked. Have you been using?
[24:16.890 --> 24:18.510]  Oh, I've been using because I've never
[24:18.510 --> 24:20.530]  used before and I wanted to
[24:20.530 --> 24:22.270]  get a feel. So this is where
[24:22.790 --> 24:24.470]  I have three separate
[24:24.470 --> 24:26.310]  Icy Hot incidents that have
[24:26.310 --> 24:28.250]  occurred in the past week. I know
[24:28.250 --> 24:30.210]  Geoff didn't buy any of the stuff that I said
[24:30.210 --> 24:32.570]  for one of the stories. Do you have the Whoopie Cushion?
[24:32.770 --> 24:34.110]  I got a Whoopie Cushion, I got the
[24:34.110 --> 24:35.970]  Bubbles, I got the gum, I got the candle.
[24:36.250 --> 24:37.210]  I got an extension lead.
[24:38.070 --> 24:40.150]  I'll go through the thing for that. I'll be honest.
[24:40.390 --> 24:41.770]  Was that a real request?
[24:42.130 --> 24:44.130]  Yes, that was a real request. Okay, because you asked everybody
[24:44.130 --> 24:46.310]  to get a six foot extension cord. So I got
[24:46.310 --> 24:47.990]  that extension cord. And then we're good.
[24:48.310 --> 24:50.130]  And then like four or five days later you're like, oh by the way,
[24:50.130 --> 24:52.050]  get a Whoopie Cushion and all that stuff. And I thought, this motherfucker
[24:52.050 --> 24:53.310]  is just trying to see how much we buy.
[24:53.650 --> 24:55.950]  No, no, no, no. This story
[24:57.290 --> 24:57.610]  occurred
[24:58.670 --> 24:59.990]  there's a purpose for it. The reason
[24:59.990 --> 25:01.930]  why it was delayed was because this event
[25:01.930 --> 25:03.950]  hadn't happened when I talked about the
[25:03.950 --> 25:05.790]  extension cord yet. We're going to go with the first one.
[25:06.130 --> 25:07.910]  This is my first experience.
[25:08.090 --> 25:10.110]  I bought both Tiger Bomb
[25:10.110 --> 25:12.030]  and Icy Hot because I had no experience
[25:12.030 --> 25:13.910]  with either. I don't know what they're like. I don't know if they're the same.
[25:14.290 --> 25:15.770]  They're different. Now are these
[25:15.770 --> 25:17.810]  creams or roll-ons? These are
[25:17.810 --> 25:19.790]  creams. These are the extra strength
[25:19.790 --> 25:21.350]  cream for both of them.
[25:21.710 --> 25:23.990]  So I'm sitting at my desk
[25:23.990 --> 25:25.870]  and I'm like, I'm going to try this out.
[25:25.950 --> 25:27.710]  So I'm going to coat. I'm just going to
[25:27.710 --> 25:29.650]  cover my left arm in Icy Hot.
[25:29.790 --> 25:31.970]  Just completely cover it. I'm going to cover
[25:31.970 --> 25:33.750]  my other arm with
[25:34.190 --> 25:35.650]  Tiger Bomb. It's just
[25:35.650 --> 25:37.630]  completely coated. And it's just
[25:37.630 --> 25:39.830]  I'm feeling the heat. I'm like, wow, this
[25:39.830 --> 25:41.830]  is a lot. I'm just sitting at my desk. I'm like,
[25:41.830 --> 25:43.110]  I'm going to go through this experience.
[25:43.470 --> 25:45.850]  About five minutes after
[25:45.850 --> 25:47.930]  I do that, I get a phone call
[25:48.430 --> 25:49.990]  informing me that somebody
[25:49.990 --> 25:51.410]  in my family has passed away.
[25:52.110 --> 25:53.430]  And it's devastating.
[25:53.630 --> 25:55.850]  It's a crushing moment.
[25:56.230 --> 25:56.830]  It's upsetting.
[25:57.510 --> 25:59.850]  But my arms are on fire because
[25:59.850 --> 26:01.970]  of the fucking Icy Hot and the Tiger
[26:01.970 --> 26:03.290]  Bomb. And I'm just
[26:03.970 --> 26:05.890]  starting to cry. I'm having a terrible
[26:05.890 --> 26:07.790]  time. I'm like, I just need to lay down
[26:07.790 --> 26:09.850]  and cry for a while. So I crawl in the
[26:09.850 --> 26:11.690]  bed. I'm getting Icy Hot
[26:11.690 --> 26:14.010]  and Tiger Bomb over all
[26:14.010 --> 26:15.950]  of my sheets. It's everywhere.
[26:16.410 --> 26:17.370]  My pillow mountain
[26:18.670 --> 26:19.390]  isn't up.
[26:20.030 --> 26:22.590]  I'm sorry, I'm laughing. It's not funny at all.
[26:22.930 --> 26:23.650]  No, it is funny.
[26:23.950 --> 26:25.970]  It's very funny. I'm telling you this because I texted
[26:25.970 --> 26:27.890]  Gavin about this. So
[26:27.890 --> 26:29.930]  I'm miserable. I'm in pain.
[26:30.210 --> 26:31.970]  I'm crying. I'm stuffed up. I'm
[26:31.970 --> 26:33.930]  starting to get a headache. And
[26:33.930 --> 26:35.950]  I'm like, I can't stay in
[26:35.950 --> 26:38.050]  this bed. I'm fucking ruining these sheets.
[26:38.450 --> 26:39.970]  I'm just going to sit in my
[26:39.970 --> 26:42.230]  bath and cry and be sad for a while
[26:42.230 --> 26:43.830]  and just ride this out.
[26:44.350 --> 26:46.010]  So I go to hop into the tub.
[26:46.190 --> 26:48.170]  I recently was given this wonderful
[26:48.170 --> 26:49.670]  gift. I got a bath pillow,
[26:50.250 --> 26:52.230]  which is like a pillow that you snap
[26:52.230 --> 26:53.650]  into your tub.
[26:53.890 --> 26:56.010]  It makes the relaxation better.
[26:56.110 --> 26:58.030]  I'm going to drop a photo in the Discord
[26:58.030 --> 27:00.250]  right now. This is the bath
[27:00.250 --> 27:02.070]  pillow, and those are
[27:02.070 --> 27:04.070]  the bottles from the clenching story
[27:04.070 --> 27:04.770]  in the past.
[27:05.150 --> 27:07.710]  One of these was potentially in your eye.
[27:07.810 --> 27:10.310]  The big one. The big one in the middle.
[27:10.310 --> 27:12.470]  I could pull that out
[27:12.470 --> 27:12.930]  of any lineup.
[27:14.930 --> 27:15.970]  So I got this
[27:15.970 --> 27:18.350]  pillow, and I'm climbing
[27:18.350 --> 27:20.450]  into the tub, and my ass hits
[27:20.450 --> 27:22.230]  it and it falls into the water.
[27:22.570 --> 27:24.350]  And I'm upset, and now I got
[27:24.350 --> 27:26.510]  my arms are on fire, my pillow
[27:26.510 --> 27:28.410]  is now drenched in water,
[27:28.610 --> 27:29.850]  and I'm like, I'm so overwhelmed.
[27:30.130 --> 27:32.530]  I don't know what to do. I'm just going to snap
[27:32.530 --> 27:34.330]  this to the wall. So I just grabbed it
[27:34.330 --> 27:36.330]  and I snapped it up higher so my head wouldn't rest
[27:36.330 --> 27:38.210]  on it. So I'm sitting in the dark,
[27:39.230 --> 27:40.430]  sad, my left
[27:40.430 --> 27:42.270]  arm is on fire with tigers, I got
[27:42.270 --> 27:44.350]  icy hot on the other arm, it's terrible,
[27:44.790 --> 27:46.070]  and then I start getting
[27:46.070 --> 27:47.830]  dripped on by my pillow
[27:47.830 --> 27:50.210]  in cold water, and I just
[27:50.210 --> 27:52.290]  started laughing. Because it was just
[27:52.290 --> 27:54.090]  disaster after disaster,
[27:55.130 --> 27:56.210]  and I just couldn't, it was
[27:56.210 --> 27:58.250]  like, of course, now I'm getting, I'm getting dripped
[27:58.250 --> 28:00.310]  on by this fluffy pillow. When I told Gavin
[28:00.310 --> 28:01.550]  the story, he had such a funny
[28:02.030 --> 28:03.870]  goddamn comment, where he's like, you,
[28:04.090 --> 28:06.170]  you're like a cartoon character, like
[28:06.170 --> 28:08.090]  in cartoons, a rain cloud
[28:08.090 --> 28:09.970]  is over a person when they're sad.
[28:10.090 --> 28:12.170]  You made your own rain cloud.
[28:12.330 --> 28:14.050]  I'm just sitting in the tub.
[28:14.550 --> 28:16.390]  So that was my first... Imagine him in the tub
[28:16.390 --> 28:18.070]  with a little, like, tiny little gray
[28:18.070 --> 28:19.190]  storm over his head.
[28:20.030 --> 28:22.070]  Dripped. This is my dumb bath pillow, which is
[28:22.070 --> 28:23.870]  great. I love it, but it's a ridiculous
[28:23.870 --> 28:26.210]  thing to own. So that, that's
[28:26.210 --> 28:27.610]  my first experience
[28:28.170 --> 28:30.110]  with icy hot. Can I ask you a question?
[28:30.230 --> 28:32.170]  Yeah. Of course. Which one was
[28:32.170 --> 28:34.190]  more intense, icy hot? I have no idea.
[28:34.190 --> 28:36.270]  The research was out the window as soon as
[28:36.270 --> 28:37.790]  I started crying. I was no longer
[28:37.790 --> 28:40.530]  paying attention. I feel like...
[28:40.530 --> 28:42.310]  I feel like they're only made worse
[28:42.310 --> 28:43.730]  by coming into contact with water.
[28:43.970 --> 28:45.510]  Or more intense. Was that not the case?
[28:45.850 --> 28:47.230]  We'll get to that. Okay.
[28:47.490 --> 28:49.810]  So now we're gonna move into story two.
[28:49.930 --> 28:51.990]  Now Gavin, you have the items I've
[28:51.990 --> 28:53.990]  sent you. When I tell you to
[28:53.990 --> 28:55.690]  prep the items, I'd say right now.
[28:55.990 --> 28:57.750]  When I say the product,
[28:58.270 --> 28:59.610]  use it the way
[28:59.610 --> 29:01.870]  that it is intended. So just to confirm,
[29:01.870 --> 29:03.790]  I'm getting out the whoopie cushion, the bubbles,
[29:04.090 --> 29:05.930]  a candle. Yeah, so the first
[29:05.930 --> 29:07.830]  thing is, can you light your candle? Are you able
[29:07.830 --> 29:09.670]  to do that? Ah, you know what? I didn't get a lighter.
[29:09.990 --> 29:11.910]  Hold on. Ah, okay. That's fine. I'll let him get
[29:11.910 --> 29:13.830]  a lighter. Prepare. Now I feel
[29:14.250 --> 29:15.790]  bad for not buying all this random
[29:15.790 --> 29:17.690]  shit. You really should have
[29:18.570 --> 29:19.770]  emphasized that you were serious.
[29:20.450 --> 29:21.830]  It just never got mentioned. It felt like
[29:21.830 --> 29:23.270]  such an aside the way you did it.
[29:24.050 --> 29:25.950]  I don't think that's true because
[29:25.950 --> 29:27.870]  I made a fucking Amazon wish list
[29:27.870 --> 29:29.830]  and sent it to you guys so it'd be easier
[29:29.830 --> 29:31.170]  for you to find. Did you really?
[29:31.270 --> 29:33.470]  Yeah, I posted it in the Slack.
[29:33.650 --> 29:35.670]  I was like, hey, here's a link if you want to order this
[29:35.670 --> 29:37.750]  on Amazon. I've been
[29:37.750 --> 29:39.830]  off my game with the mouth stuff. I may have just missed that.
[29:39.870 --> 29:41.290]  No, that's fair. Totally fair.
[29:42.530 --> 29:43.390]  Okay, so let me
[29:43.390 --> 29:45.790]  organize this. Wait for
[29:45.790 --> 29:47.670]  Gavin to come back. This is two
[29:47.670 --> 29:49.710]  of three and I think this is the most expansive
[29:50.450 --> 29:51.810]  story, but I need
[29:51.810 --> 29:53.610]  to talk about the third event because it has
[29:53.610 --> 29:55.190]  impacted other things as well.
[29:57.090 --> 29:57.770]  Oh, it's
[29:57.770 --> 29:59.730]  been a lot of pain. Okay, you back
[29:59.730 --> 30:01.070]  Gavin? Yeah, I got a lighter.
[30:01.750 --> 30:02.670]  So Gavin
[30:03.450 --> 30:05.370]  and Eric are always talking about
[30:05.370 --> 30:07.590]  the genius that is, the exciting
[30:07.590 --> 30:09.530]  experience that is Dbox.
[30:10.110 --> 30:11.670]  And we got a new avatar coming
[30:11.670 --> 30:13.470]  out, the first avatar, biggest movie
[30:13.470 --> 30:15.670]  of all time. I don't know if that's still true. Probably isn't.
[30:15.830 --> 30:17.590]  It was huge. That was all about
[30:17.590 --> 30:19.690]  new technology. So I thought
[30:19.690 --> 30:21.590]  I need to bring some new
[30:21.590 --> 30:23.590]  technology to the podcast game
[30:23.590 --> 30:25.810]  so this is the Dbox experience
[30:25.810 --> 30:26.790]  because you gotta do it yourself.
[30:27.850 --> 30:29.430]  You can't do it for you.
[30:30.330 --> 30:31.790]  We're doing Dbox right
[30:31.790 --> 30:33.510]  now. Should I be filming this?
[30:34.070 --> 30:36.010]  No, I don't think so. You don't have to. But if the audience
[30:36.010 --> 30:37.270]  wants to be in the
[30:39.190 --> 30:40.030]  Dbox experience,
[30:40.790 --> 30:41.610]  you'll need a candle,
[30:42.170 --> 30:43.390]  a pack of dentine ice,
[30:44.330 --> 30:45.670]  bubbles that you can blow,
[30:46.350 --> 30:47.090]  and a whoopee cushion.
[30:47.790 --> 30:49.730]  Alright, so stop, pause the
[30:49.730 --> 30:51.730]  podcast here or go to Target
[30:51.730 --> 30:53.630]  or Walmart, buy that shit and then come back.
[30:53.630 --> 30:55.650]  Alright, I'm just gonna... So light your
[30:55.650 --> 30:55.970]  candle.
[30:57.810 --> 30:59.610]  I just filled up the whoopee cushion.
[31:01.630 --> 31:03.590]  Alright, I think I'm all set. I got all my tools.
[31:05.830 --> 31:06.870]  Okay, so...
[31:07.490 --> 31:09.550]  What happened was, this is
[31:09.550 --> 31:11.390]  probably the fifth or sixth time
[31:11.390 --> 31:13.130]  I've used Icy Hot at this stage.
[31:14.070 --> 31:15.410]  And to be completely honest,
[31:15.690 --> 31:17.070]  I was kinda disappointed
[31:17.630 --> 31:19.470]  with the effect of it so far.
[31:20.170 --> 31:21.590]  So, I thought
[31:21.590 --> 31:23.850]  I'm going to quadruple
[31:24.610 --> 31:25.390]  the amount
[31:25.390 --> 31:27.090]  I've typically been using.
[31:27.730 --> 31:29.570]  And I'm gonna coat my arm in it.
[31:29.790 --> 31:30.470]  I'm just gonna fill it.
[31:30.910 --> 31:33.530]  What effect are you going for?
[31:33.610 --> 31:35.090]  Do you have a sore arm?
[31:36.110 --> 31:37.490]  Sometimes I get a sore wrist
[31:37.490 --> 31:39.370]  on the one that I dislocated for a long time.
[31:39.370 --> 31:41.270]  You know it's like for muscle pain, right?
[31:41.570 --> 31:43.430]  Yeah, it's just more like
[31:43.430 --> 31:45.790]  the Icy Hot effect.
[31:45.990 --> 31:47.470]  I was expecting it to be more
[31:47.470 --> 31:49.750]  intense than it had been to this point.
[31:49.750 --> 31:51.350]  So I thought, what if I apply more?
[31:51.830 --> 31:53.390]  Maybe I'm not applying enough
[31:53.390 --> 31:55.830]  to get the effect that I would assume
[31:56.210 --> 31:57.070]  that it would have.
[31:58.150 --> 31:59.410]  So, applied all my arm.
[31:59.510 --> 32:01.550]  I'm playing Stacking, or I was at that time,
[32:01.630 --> 32:02.370]  which is a great game.
[32:04.270 --> 32:05.370]  Immediately it works.
[32:05.550 --> 32:07.810]  It's successful. My arm is radiating.
[32:07.970 --> 32:09.650]  It's so much cooler than it had
[32:09.650 --> 32:11.710]  ever been before. This is great.
[32:11.790 --> 32:12.890]  I just have to use more
[32:12.890 --> 32:15.810]  if I want it to be a more intense
[32:16.210 --> 32:17.730]  effect. So it's good.
[32:17.730 --> 32:19.570]  It kind of dies down after a while,
[32:19.670 --> 32:21.050]  so I'm not happy about that.
[32:21.290 --> 32:23.730]  But then, Whoopie Cushion.
[32:27.930 --> 32:28.590]  Nailed it.
[32:28.770 --> 32:30.210]  That sounded so minimal.
[32:31.390 --> 32:33.350]  So the problem was, it was a Trojan fart.
[32:33.510 --> 32:35.550]  It had more in it than I was anticipating.
[32:36.350 --> 32:37.410]  So I had to quickly
[32:37.410 --> 32:39.210]  run to the bathroom.
[32:39.750 --> 32:40.670]  So I'm in the bathroom,
[32:41.170 --> 32:43.510]  and I'm just sitting. I'm sitting, using the bathroom.
[32:43.670 --> 32:45.530]  I'm on my phone. I'm watching clips.
[32:45.530 --> 32:47.810]  I'm just having... I'm having a good time.
[32:47.930 --> 32:48.710]  Denti Nice, Gavin.
[32:49.050 --> 32:51.050]  Having a good time. How many?
[32:51.730 --> 32:52.630]  Just the two.
[32:54.110 --> 32:55.070]  Start chewing away.
[32:55.290 --> 32:57.490]  Denti Nice. So I'm sitting. I'm on the toilet.
[32:57.930 --> 32:59.190]  Done. Stand up.
[32:59.630 --> 33:01.390]  I'm in the sink. I'm washing my hands.
[33:02.270 --> 33:03.450]  All of a sudden, my
[33:03.450 --> 33:05.410]  asshole feels like the feeling
[33:05.410 --> 33:07.430]  in your mouth right now. It is a
[33:07.430 --> 33:09.470]  cold chill. I have made
[33:09.470 --> 33:11.750]  an error. I used the same hand...
[33:11.750 --> 33:13.530]  By the way, that's the...
[33:13.530 --> 33:15.550]  That you're describing? That's the joy
[33:15.550 --> 33:16.870]  that is the Too Spicy Icy.
[33:17.530 --> 33:19.410]  It is. Yes. But that is...
[33:19.410 --> 33:21.510]  So the difference between the Too Spicy Icy
[33:21.510 --> 33:22.730]  and this experience
[33:23.370 --> 33:25.570]  is I'm at first shocked
[33:25.570 --> 33:27.570]  and terrified because I realize
[33:27.570 --> 33:29.070]  what I've done. I've used the same hand.
[33:29.430 --> 33:31.470]  This is a problem. But then it's kinda
[33:31.470 --> 33:33.390]  nice. It feels good.
[33:33.510 --> 33:35.530]  Like it's kind of a frosty freshness.
[33:36.110 --> 33:37.010]  Everything's sweet.
[33:37.270 --> 33:39.530]  Like your butthole's minty. Yeah, I imagine
[33:39.530 --> 33:41.430]  this is what like Sub-Zero's door
[33:41.430 --> 33:43.430]  feels like. Like it's not too cold
[33:43.430 --> 33:45.350]  but there's a definite feeling of
[33:45.350 --> 33:47.030]  cold in the air.
[33:48.090 --> 33:49.430]  Sub-Zero, I assume
[33:49.430 --> 33:51.030]  he lives in a cold place. Yeah.
[33:52.030 --> 33:53.490]  Yeah. But it's not
[33:54.230 --> 33:54.770]  because
[33:55.400 --> 33:56.850]  yeah because the inside
[33:57.400 --> 33:58.770]  is colder than the outside.
[33:59.190 --> 34:00.630]  So it's not freezing
[34:01.260 --> 34:03.170]  but it's because it's
[34:03.170 --> 34:05.090]  radiated through. It's a lesser cool.
[34:05.210 --> 34:06.850]  It's a nice feeling. But then
[34:07.510 --> 34:08.770]  then I remember
[34:08.770 --> 34:10.610]  that this has waves
[34:10.610 --> 34:12.590]  and the panic really hits.
[34:12.990 --> 34:14.930]  And I'm like, oh fuck. I feel like
[34:14.930 --> 34:17.150]  I have lit a fuse to my ass
[34:17.150 --> 34:18.750]  that I need to try to
[34:18.750 --> 34:20.910]  extinguish as quickly as
[34:20.910 --> 34:23.090]  possible. So I hop in the tub
[34:23.090 --> 34:24.590]  I fill it with water
[34:24.590 --> 34:26.750]  I'm just holding. I'm clenching
[34:26.750 --> 34:28.270]  because I'm terrified.
[34:28.730 --> 34:30.610]  I don't know what's gonna happen. It's just
[34:30.610 --> 34:32.770]  it's a bad time.
[34:33.130 --> 34:34.730]  It's a fury. Thanks.
[34:35.390 --> 34:36.790]  Blow bubbles. Gavin.
[34:36.790 --> 34:38.730]  Oh shit, there's a seal on the...
[34:38.730 --> 34:39.070]  Hold on.
[34:41.310 --> 34:42.770]  Get the bubbles ready. So I'm sitting
[34:42.770 --> 34:44.270]  in the tub. I'm in pain.
[34:45.210 --> 34:46.650]  I don't... I'm clenching real hard.
[34:46.730 --> 34:48.490]  My arm is once again on fire.
[34:48.590 --> 34:50.590]  It has come back a little bit. I'm feeling the heat.
[34:51.070 --> 34:52.690]  You blow bubbles, Gavin? I'm still
[34:52.690 --> 34:54.210]  trying to get the lid off. Okay.
[34:54.750 --> 34:56.710]  Well, I'm just gonna continue. You blow bubbles
[34:56.710 --> 34:58.710]  when you can. I'll let you know when they're coming.
[35:00.270 --> 35:00.970]  Are you still
[35:00.970 --> 35:02.590]  chewing the gum too or have you discarded it?
[35:02.590 --> 35:03.870]  Yeah, you can get rid of the gum.
[35:03.870 --> 35:04.950]  You don't need the gum anymore.
[35:05.970 --> 35:07.690]  This is a very... it's very do-it-yourself.
[35:07.810 --> 35:09.930]  It's actually a little bit distracting from the story, but the effects
[35:09.930 --> 35:11.990]  are amazing. As soon as you talked about
[35:11.990 --> 35:13.770]  your asshole being like this gum, I could
[35:13.770 --> 35:15.170]  imagine it so well. Yeah.
[35:15.570 --> 35:17.090]  It was the same feeling.
[35:17.950 --> 35:19.850]  And I hadn't had denty nice in a long time,
[35:19.890 --> 35:21.510]  but I was like, oh my god, this is denty nice.
[35:21.950 --> 35:22.570]  Are you okay?
[35:23.370 --> 35:25.490]  He spilled juice all over the keyboard.
[35:29.730 --> 35:30.510]  This is great.
[35:30.510 --> 35:31.610]  Alright, hang on.
[35:31.710 --> 35:33.510]  Blow some bubbles.
[35:34.770 --> 35:35.890]  Oh god.
[35:36.610 --> 35:38.570]  You okay? Oh god, that's
[35:38.570 --> 35:41.450]  a shitload of water.
[35:44.630 --> 35:46.710]  So then I fart under the water
[35:46.710 --> 35:48.710]  and it is like the gates of hell
[35:48.710 --> 35:50.630]  opened with the gas, which
[35:50.630 --> 35:51.970]  confirms... okay.
[35:53.850 --> 35:54.550]  Weld it.
[35:55.090 --> 35:56.090]  That's so good.
[35:56.310 --> 35:57.250]  Let's blow it up again.
[35:57.250 --> 35:58.650]  It's an underwater fart.
[35:59.050 --> 36:01.630]  It was fiery and I realized
[36:01.630 --> 36:03.510]  that, oh god, my fears
[36:03.510 --> 36:05.390]  are confirmed. My asshole is on
[36:05.390 --> 36:06.510]  fire right now.
[36:07.090 --> 36:09.210]  This is terrible. I'm gonna do
[36:09.210 --> 36:11.210]  a slightly more advanced move, Andrew. I'm just gonna
[36:11.210 --> 36:13.430]  get some... I'm gonna dip the tip of the
[36:13.430 --> 36:14.690]  whoopie cushion in the bubbles
[36:15.230 --> 36:17.370]  to try and mimic the underwater fart.
[36:17.670 --> 36:18.770]  Oh, this is a great idea.
[36:19.110 --> 36:21.010]  Put my hand in the candle. Hold on.
[36:21.690 --> 36:22.850]  I'm gonna see if this does anything.
[36:22.850 --> 36:23.110]  Shh.
[36:26.430 --> 36:28.250]  That sounded so sad.
[36:29.290 --> 36:30.750]  It blew a little bubble.
[36:34.150 --> 36:35.370]  Oh my god.
[36:35.910 --> 36:38.290]  Andrew, you're inventing a new form of entertainment
[36:38.290 --> 36:39.390]  here. I fucking love it.
[36:40.110 --> 36:42.310]  I can't wait for us to do
[36:42.310 --> 36:42.930]  box again.
[36:44.670 --> 36:45.990]  So that happened.
[36:46.850 --> 36:48.230]  I'm terrified. I'm continuing to
[36:48.230 --> 36:48.610]  clench.
[36:50.150 --> 36:52.330]  But then things go okay. I'm there for
[36:52.330 --> 36:54.390]  like 10 minutes. You okay?
[36:55.110 --> 36:55.690]  You okay, Gavin?
[36:58.390 --> 36:58.910]  Gavin?
[37:00.510 --> 37:02.450]  I'm having such a good
[37:02.450 --> 37:02.950]  time.
[37:08.740 --> 37:10.300]  I need to wash my hands.
[37:17.550 --> 37:19.290]  Is he just blowing bubbles
[37:19.290 --> 37:20.170]  with the whoopie cushion?
[37:22.110 --> 37:23.490]  He's nine years old now.
[37:23.870 --> 37:25.070]  Yeah, this is great.
[37:27.370 --> 37:29.010]  So I think things are terrible
[37:29.010 --> 37:30.590]  because of the fiery farts.
[37:31.390 --> 37:33.130]  Then things calm down for a bit
[37:33.130 --> 37:35.590]  and I'm okay. But then my arm
[37:35.590 --> 37:37.470]  reignites. The icy hot
[37:37.470 --> 37:38.570]  really kicks in.
[37:38.990 --> 37:41.290]  And I am now once again terrified
[37:41.290 --> 37:43.150]  because it applied to my arm about
[37:43.150 --> 37:45.370]  15 minutes before it got in
[37:45.370 --> 37:47.130]  my ass. So I'm just wondering
[37:47.130 --> 37:49.270]  am I on a clock? Is the clock running
[37:49.270 --> 37:50.630]  now in 15 minutes?
[37:51.190 --> 37:53.390]  Am I gonna experience this wrath
[37:53.390 --> 37:54.710]  once again in my asshole?
[37:55.850 --> 37:57.410]  And I was paranoid.
[37:57.610 --> 37:59.510]  15 minutes passed after that. Nothing
[37:59.510 --> 38:01.170]  happens. But I was so scared.
[38:01.450 --> 38:03.810]  I spent an additional hour in the tub
[38:03.810 --> 38:05.510]  just nervous that
[38:05.510 --> 38:07.710]  it would appear. Yeah, just to be safe.
[38:07.870 --> 38:09.710]  Yeah. Then I cautiously
[38:09.710 --> 38:11.550]  I don't know if Gavin's back. I'm back.
[38:12.170 --> 38:12.630]  Okay.
[38:13.490 --> 38:15.630]  After all that, I cautiously
[38:15.630 --> 38:17.150]  get out of the bath
[38:17.710 --> 38:19.850]  and confirm that the fire
[38:19.850 --> 38:21.650]  in my ass has now been
[38:21.650 --> 38:23.570]  extinguished. Gavin, blow out your
[38:23.570 --> 38:25.290]  candle. And that
[38:25.290 --> 38:27.130]  was our first Dubox experience.
[38:28.090 --> 38:29.250]  That was phenomenal.
[38:29.810 --> 38:31.570]  What an experience. I had a really good
[38:31.570 --> 38:33.450]  time with all my
[38:33.450 --> 38:35.150]  tools. I made a real mess.
[38:36.970 --> 38:37.730]  I am
[38:37.730 --> 38:39.550]  so jealous that I feel so
[38:39.550 --> 38:41.430]  lame that I didn't participate. But that was so
[38:41.430 --> 38:43.070]  fun to listen to. I'm so excited
[38:43.070 --> 38:45.130]  for us all to Dubox in the future.
[38:46.670 --> 38:47.550]  I have one more
[38:47.550 --> 38:48.710]  icy hot incident
[38:49.350 --> 38:51.470]  that has been a
[38:51.470 --> 38:53.370]  massive annoyance in my life. Oh yeah, please.
[38:53.630 --> 38:55.470]  Where, after all of this
[38:55.930 --> 38:57.590]  this is the third event
[38:57.590 --> 38:59.090]  that occurred, I thought
[38:59.090 --> 39:01.550]  I didn't really remember how we got to
[39:01.550 --> 39:03.470]  balls. Because we were talking
[39:03.470 --> 39:05.530]  about pictures. It was one of y'all. It was one of you two.
[39:05.590 --> 39:07.590]  Oh, it was definitely Gavin. Balls?
[39:07.690 --> 39:08.710]  It was a baseball thing.
[39:09.290 --> 39:11.210]  Yeah, but the whole thing was that
[39:11.210 --> 39:12.930]  they would apply icy hot to their ears.
[39:12.930 --> 39:15.010]  I was thinking ears. And then somebody
[39:15.010 --> 39:16.850]  says, we'll put it on our balls. And I was like...
[39:16.850 --> 39:19.470]  No, that was the story Eric told about the guy who rubbed it on his
[39:19.470 --> 39:21.570]  cock and balls. I don't remember that
[39:21.570 --> 39:23.610]  story at all. I just remember us talking
[39:23.610 --> 39:25.330]  about the Padres
[39:25.330 --> 39:27.650]  pitching thing with the ears. Oh, Roger
[39:27.650 --> 39:28.810]  Clemens. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:29.390 --> 39:31.470]  And then we went to balls. Okay, so there was a reason.
[39:31.550 --> 39:33.270]  I just didn't remember it. But I thought,
[39:33.390 --> 39:35.510]  huh, I wonder what the ears would feel
[39:35.510 --> 39:37.330]  like. So I hopped
[39:37.330 --> 39:39.670]  in the tub. I'm in the dark once again.
[39:39.670 --> 39:41.790]  It's the evening. Are you still sad at this point?
[39:42.710 --> 39:43.490]  No, I'd
[39:43.490 --> 39:44.810]  say I'm on the upswing. Okay.
[39:45.630 --> 39:47.450]  I'm feeling better. Not great, but
[39:47.450 --> 39:49.170]  I'm getting there. This is a few days later.
[39:50.750 --> 39:51.550]  And I'm
[39:51.550 --> 39:53.350]  sitting in the tub. It's filled with water.
[39:53.470 --> 39:55.410]  I'm like, okay, I'm now going to apply
[39:55.410 --> 39:57.410]  the Icy Hot, but I'm in the
[39:57.410 --> 39:59.410]  dark, so I need a light to see everything. So
[39:59.410 --> 40:01.370]  I use the flashlight app on the phone
[40:01.370 --> 40:02.590]  that you gave me, Gavin.
[40:03.610 --> 40:05.610]  And I put it on the side of the tub
[40:05.610 --> 40:07.330]  and I turn for the Icy Hot
[40:07.330 --> 40:09.410]  and it slides in like
[40:09.410 --> 40:11.430]  a skateboarder going down a ramp. Like, it just
[40:11.430 --> 40:13.510]  rolls into the water. And I
[40:14.190 --> 40:14.990]  immediately panic
[40:14.990 --> 40:17.370]  because I have a small crack
[40:17.370 --> 40:19.370]  in the bottom left corner of the screen.
[40:19.490 --> 40:20.870]  I'm like, oh, it's going to fill with water.
[40:21.050 --> 40:22.590]  So I put my foot on it
[40:22.590 --> 40:25.390]  and I slide it up the other end of the tub
[40:25.390 --> 40:27.170]  and I'm applying all of my
[40:27.170 --> 40:29.050]  pressure. It's like it's on the
[40:29.050 --> 40:31.070]  balls of my feet, essentially, sticking up
[40:31.070 --> 40:32.590]  above my toes. And I'm
[40:33.270 --> 40:35.310]  fully extended in the tub.
[40:35.330 --> 40:36.990]  I'm imagining like a Mission Impossible
[40:36.990 --> 40:37.470]  one.
[40:38.390 --> 40:41.090]  That is exactly what's going on. And the flashlight
[40:41.090 --> 40:43.050]  is blasting me in the face. That's the way
[40:43.050 --> 40:45.090]  it's facing. And I'm trying
[40:45.090 --> 40:46.870]  to figure out a way
[40:46.870 --> 40:48.990]  while the water is fully turned on. So it's
[40:48.990 --> 40:51.050]  filling with hot water. The hottest water it could
[40:51.050 --> 40:52.950]  have. And I'm trying to navigate
[40:52.950 --> 40:55.050]  all this. I'm attempting to move it
[40:55.050 --> 40:56.930]  to a place in which I could grab it
[40:56.930 --> 40:58.830]  but it's not working. I can't go under.
[40:59.250 --> 41:01.050]  This is how the tub is designed. I can't
[41:01.050 --> 41:02.790]  get it wet again because I'm worried about the hole.
[41:03.350 --> 41:05.250]  So I spend like 10 minutes
[41:05.250 --> 41:06.950]  attempting to do this
[41:06.950 --> 41:08.970]  myself. And I'm
[41:08.970 --> 41:11.050]  struggling. I'm like, okay, I'm going to try to get it to move
[41:11.050 --> 41:12.910]  walls. So I adjust it.
[41:13.110 --> 41:14.770]  It slides down my feet.
[41:15.170 --> 41:17.170]  And now it's in like the arch of my foot
[41:17.170 --> 41:18.610]  where it's not sticking out at all.
[41:18.750 --> 41:20.610]  And I'm completely screwed.
[41:21.250 --> 41:22.890]  And so I'm just laying there. My
[41:22.890 --> 41:24.910]  flashlight in the dark. My phone
[41:24.910 --> 41:26.630]  trapped to the wall with my foot.
[41:26.790 --> 41:28.830]  And I have to call out to my partner
[41:28.830 --> 41:31.130]  if they wouldn't mind coming in here. I need a hand.
[41:31.170 --> 41:33.070]  I need a hand with something. And they
[41:33.070 --> 41:35.230]  open the door to me like fully
[41:35.230 --> 41:37.050]  stretched out in the tub naked
[41:37.050 --> 41:38.630]  with a phone beneath my foot.
[41:38.630 --> 41:40.530]  So are you on your back
[41:40.530 --> 41:42.690]  with your foot pressed against the opposite wall still?
[41:43.070 --> 41:44.790]  I am, yes. So that surely means
[41:44.790 --> 41:46.770]  your genitals are fully
[41:46.770 --> 41:48.190]  up in the air sticking out of the water.
[41:48.810 --> 41:49.250]  Oh, yeah.
[41:49.250 --> 41:52.830]  It's a terrible image for anyone to see.
[41:53.110 --> 41:54.690]  And they just open the door
[41:54.690 --> 41:56.290]  and say, what are you doing?
[41:56.450 --> 41:57.950]  Because I've got this flashlight
[41:58.470 --> 42:00.590]  and I'm like, I can't. Could you please just
[42:00.590 --> 42:02.290]  grab the phone from my foot?
[42:02.950 --> 42:04.830]  And they're like, you are... It just looks like an awful selfie
[42:04.830 --> 42:05.630]  being taken.
[42:09.070 --> 42:09.810]  So they
[42:10.500 --> 42:12.630]  grab it and they give it back to me
[42:12.630 --> 42:14.310]  and they just say, you are ridiculous.
[42:14.590 --> 42:15.690]  And then they leave.
[42:16.210 --> 42:18.310]  I say, thank you. I'm
[42:18.310 --> 42:20.490]  happy because I think my phone is okay.
[42:20.590 --> 42:22.370]  Everything is good. About
[42:22.370 --> 42:24.550]  three hours later, I haven't been
[42:24.550 --> 42:26.450]  able to get my speakers to work since
[42:26.450 --> 42:28.570]  that point, which sometimes happens
[42:28.570 --> 42:30.350]  where it'll think that there's...
[42:30.350 --> 42:32.590]  Because there's a residue or something
[42:32.590 --> 42:34.590]  in the headphone jack, it thinks
[42:34.590 --> 42:36.590]  that I have headphones plugged in when I don't.
[42:36.590 --> 42:38.330]  So that's been an issue in the past.
[42:38.630 --> 42:40.570]  My speaker starts to hiss
[42:40.570 --> 42:42.310]  a little bit. And I thought, oh,
[42:42.870 --> 42:44.710]  this must be...
[42:44.710 --> 42:46.590]  this must be it. There must be
[42:46.590 --> 42:48.090]  something there. Something's going on.
[42:48.230 --> 42:49.950]  I will suck the moisture out.
[42:50.330 --> 42:52.490]  So I attempt to suck the moisture out.
[42:52.690 --> 42:54.730]  I get the little vibration
[42:54.730 --> 42:56.670]  you get when you hit a key
[42:56.670 --> 42:58.430]  on a phone. My phone vibrates.
[42:58.770 --> 43:00.390]  Then the entire thing dies.
[43:00.790 --> 43:02.650]  I killed my phone. My phone
[43:02.650 --> 43:04.750]  died. I've been phoneless
[43:04.750 --> 43:06.770]  for like six days at this point.
[43:06.930 --> 43:08.630]  I just set up my old,
[43:08.770 --> 43:10.850]  shitty hot dog device phone that I love
[43:10.850 --> 43:11.730]  but it's terrible
[43:12.530 --> 43:14.610]  while my new phone arrives because it's going to take
[43:14.610 --> 43:16.670]  another week. And I missed you both, so I just wanted to be able
[43:16.670 --> 43:18.870]  to text you. So that's been...
[43:18.870 --> 43:20.910]  That's been my icy hot experience
[43:20.910 --> 43:22.610]  to this point. I shouldn't have it.
[43:22.970 --> 43:24.970]  It shouldn't be near me. It's been terrible.
[43:25.470 --> 43:26.510]  So let me ask you a question.
[43:27.030 --> 43:28.390]  Well, I'm going to ask two questions.
[43:28.670 --> 43:30.910]  One, did you put it on your ears?
[43:30.930 --> 43:32.890]  And if so, how was it? I did not apply
[43:32.890 --> 43:34.670]  it to my ears at that time. No.
[43:34.870 --> 43:36.810]  That was not... It never came together.
[43:37.190 --> 43:38.870]  I was crushed by the phone
[43:38.870 --> 43:40.770]  experience. Have you at
[43:40.770 --> 43:42.910]  any point used it as intended?
[43:43.310 --> 43:44.450]  One time. Yeah.
[43:44.490 --> 43:46.610]  I do, as I said, sometimes my
[43:46.610 --> 43:48.790]  wrist flares up a little bit and I was like,
[43:48.830 --> 43:51.190]  I'll try it on this and see if it helps at all.
[43:51.230 --> 43:52.350]  I don't feel like it did.
[43:52.610 --> 43:54.910]  It might not have been for that specific issue, but if you ever
[43:54.910 --> 43:56.910]  have sore muscles, I would recommend it.
[43:57.350 --> 43:58.950]  When used properly, it can be highly
[43:58.950 --> 44:00.890]  effective. The problem...
[44:00.890 --> 44:02.790]  The main problem with Icy Hot, which
[44:02.790 --> 44:04.310]  by the way, I think is trash,
[44:04.430 --> 44:06.890]  I highly recommend Tiger Balm,
[44:07.470 --> 44:08.910]  is that it's kind of like psychedelic
[44:08.910 --> 44:10.630]  drugs, like acid,
[44:10.990 --> 44:12.590]  or maybe like mushrooms,
[44:12.750 --> 44:14.850]  where it's fun at first, but then at
[44:14.850 --> 44:16.810]  some point you're done with it, and you're like, I had that
[44:16.810 --> 44:18.970]  experience, I'm done with this. But it's not done with you.
[44:19.630 --> 44:20.770]  It works on its own
[44:20.770 --> 44:22.890]  timetable. And so Icy Hot can be like,
[44:22.950 --> 44:24.430]  no, no, you're in this
[44:24.830 --> 44:26.770]  for another two hours, whether you want to be or not.
[44:27.010 --> 44:28.970]  Is there anything that counteracts the effects
[44:28.970 --> 44:30.770]  if you want to get rid of it? Oh, yeah!
[44:30.910 --> 44:31.250]  Easily.
[44:33.730 --> 44:34.230]  Like what?
[44:34.430 --> 44:36.190]  Did you want to know what that was? Oh, yeah.
[44:36.430 --> 44:36.790]  Yeah.
[44:37.610 --> 44:40.750]  Oh, just time? Oh, great.
[44:40.850 --> 44:42.750]  Old-fashioned time. Fantastic. Old-fashioned time.
[44:42.810 --> 44:43.590]  Takes care of it.
[44:44.570 --> 44:46.930]  Like right now, Andrew, enough time has passed,
[44:47.090 --> 44:48.050]  doesn't feel any effects.
[44:49.250 --> 44:50.890]  Oh, I don't know if I'd say that, but
[44:52.710 --> 44:53.430]  should we...
[44:53.870 --> 44:54.970]  We're kind of getting deep
[44:54.970 --> 44:56.910]  in this podcast. I got everybody
[44:56.910 --> 44:58.010]  on this show something.
[44:58.610 --> 44:59.710]  Should we go to that?
[45:00.410 --> 45:02.430]  Yeah, this has been such a prop-heavy
[45:02.430 --> 45:03.950]  show. This is amazing.
[45:04.390 --> 45:07.310]  Am I opening the envelope or the bag?
[45:07.850 --> 45:09.330]  So, Andrew, just so you know,
[45:09.570 --> 45:11.210]  there is a gift-wrapped bag
[45:11.210 --> 45:13.030]  and then the second thing
[45:13.030 --> 45:14.770]  that came in a pack, I put
[45:14.770 --> 45:16.970]  an individual envelope so they
[45:16.970 --> 45:18.250]  also couldn't see what that was.
[45:18.750 --> 45:21.090]  Thank you so much, Eric. Is that why my envelope
[45:21.090 --> 45:23.290]  says, attention Ezra, and it's scribbled out?
[45:23.450 --> 45:24.230]  Yes, it does.
[45:26.490 --> 45:27.350]  So as I said,
[45:27.430 --> 45:29.410]  has it been the best time?
[45:29.550 --> 45:30.150]  Mine says Diane.
[45:31.150 --> 45:31.850]  That's great.
[45:32.410 --> 45:34.810]  It does not say Diane. Diane is also
[45:34.810 --> 45:35.970]  scribbled out.
[45:39.550 --> 45:40.670]  So what am I opening?
[45:41.510 --> 45:42.890]  Yeah, so I'll tell you in a minute.
[45:42.910 --> 45:44.710]  I'm just going to lead into it. I think you should probably
[45:44.710 --> 45:46.830]  open the gift box first
[45:46.830 --> 45:47.870]  for both of you.
[45:48.590 --> 45:49.490]  But not yet.
[45:50.130 --> 45:52.810]  Oh, I haven't even read the label. What does this say?
[45:53.450 --> 45:55.130]  It says, from Andrew
[45:55.130 --> 45:55.510]  Patton.
[45:57.450 --> 45:57.930]  Great.
[45:58.850 --> 46:00.850]  This is another gift that I had gotten
[46:00.850 --> 46:02.790]  recently and it's changed my life.
[46:02.950 --> 46:04.990]  It brought something that I love to a different
[46:04.990 --> 46:07.050]  level and I've fallen back in love
[46:07.050 --> 46:08.890]  with this. It's been great and so
[46:08.890 --> 46:10.310]  I figured I got one for everybody
[46:10.850 --> 46:12.970]  related to the show. I did forget
[46:12.970 --> 46:14.970]  to get one for Minor League Fan
[46:14.970 --> 46:16.930]  Jack. I will plan on doing
[46:16.930 --> 46:18.890]  that later. I forgot about the time when I was
[46:18.890 --> 46:20.910]  ordering these. I think you can both
[46:20.910 --> 46:21.730]  open them now.
[46:22.210 --> 46:24.990]  This better not be a Red Baron
[46:24.990 --> 46:26.650]  pizza. Oh, wow!
[46:28.110 --> 46:28.930]  It's a
[46:28.930 --> 46:30.550]  tiny waffle iron!
[46:31.190 --> 46:33.010]  A little baby waffle iron!
[46:33.570 --> 46:35.010]  It's a tiny little baby. I've been
[46:35.010 --> 46:37.110]  making desk waffles and tiny little baby
[46:37.110 --> 46:38.810]  waffle makers changed my life.
[46:39.650 --> 46:41.050]  I know, Geoff, you've been having food
[46:41.050 --> 46:42.990]  issues, so I understand if you don't want
[46:42.990 --> 46:44.690]  to participate in this, but
[46:44.690 --> 46:46.550]  I just didn't want you to feel excluded.
[46:46.830 --> 46:47.710]  No, I appreciate it.
[46:48.530 --> 46:49.850]  This makes me feel really bad.
[46:49.970 --> 46:51.830]  I bought presents for y'all recently too
[46:51.830 --> 46:53.650]  and I forgot to give them to everybody, but I didn't
[46:53.650 --> 46:55.830]  get any for Andrew. Sounds like I need to buy presents
[46:55.830 --> 46:57.750]  for people. Oh, shit.
[46:57.830 --> 46:59.630]  So then you can open up your other item
[47:00.150 --> 47:01.670]  which is essential, I'd say,
[47:01.730 --> 47:03.650]  to the experience. Wow, that is really
[47:03.650 --> 47:05.610]  cool. That's like a couple
[47:05.610 --> 47:06.850]  of bites. That's amazing.
[47:07.630 --> 47:08.390]  This is great.
[47:09.630 --> 47:10.630]  Opening up the envelope.
[47:11.930 --> 47:13.210]  I hope Ezra doesn't mind.
[47:15.350 --> 47:16.010]  Oh, it's
[47:16.010 --> 47:17.270]  some pancake mix.
[47:18.330 --> 47:19.650]  I figured we could all
[47:19.650 --> 47:21.690]  cook a desk waffle
[47:21.690 --> 47:24.030]  together on the show. I could show you my world
[47:24.030 --> 47:25.630]  a little bit and expose you
[47:25.630 --> 47:27.850]  to the joy that you've been
[47:27.850 --> 47:28.130]  lacking.
[47:29.610 --> 47:31.550]  I'm gonna prep mine right now.
[47:31.690 --> 47:33.890]  I actually bought a skillet version
[47:33.890 --> 47:35.950]  as well. They have a skillet version of this product.
[47:36.110 --> 47:38.150]  I'm gonna put some bacon on too, which I haven't done yet.
[47:38.850 --> 47:39.890]  But I need to prep
[47:39.890 --> 47:41.690]  on the... I need to... that's what I need.
[47:42.010 --> 47:43.250]  Water. You just need water.
[47:43.250 --> 47:44.350]  You just need water.
[47:44.570 --> 47:46.710]  Stir it. It's really easy.
[47:47.490 --> 47:49.090]  Should I get the additionals?
[47:49.210 --> 47:49.890]  Yeah, go ahead.
[47:50.270 --> 47:53.090]  I'm gonna go get water also. I'll be right back.
[47:53.950 --> 47:54.350]  Fantastic.
[47:55.950 --> 47:57.390]  Nick, yours is at the office.
[47:58.370 --> 47:58.690]  Yeah.
[47:59.430 --> 48:01.290]  This is gonna be great. I'm excited.
[48:01.710 --> 48:03.350]  I can't wait for you to try, Nick. You're gonna have to
[48:03.350 --> 48:05.350]  give me your opinions. This is one of the
[48:05.350 --> 48:06.770]  best gifts I've ever been given.
[48:07.830 --> 48:09.170]  I've made so many waffles
[48:09.170 --> 48:11.390]  and I need to because I still have like 50 pounds
[48:11.390 --> 48:11.970]  of mix.
[48:12.390 --> 48:14.810]  You just didn't pay it forward to us.
[48:15.050 --> 48:16.130]  Thank you. I did.
[48:19.250 --> 48:19.850]  Um...
[48:19.850 --> 48:21.090]  Okay, let me prep this.
[48:21.390 --> 48:23.310]  I'm gonna actually... I'm gonna open my bacon.
[48:24.610 --> 48:25.590]  I forgot
[48:25.590 --> 48:27.230]  my fucking meat hands.
[48:27.450 --> 48:29.050]  Oh no. This is gonna be bad.
[48:29.850 --> 48:30.470]  It's gonna be messy.
[48:30.870 --> 48:32.150]  What are meat hands?
[48:32.910 --> 48:33.950]  Like gloves.
[48:34.890 --> 48:37.430]  I thought you were giving a code name
[48:37.430 --> 48:38.390]  to your hands.
[48:38.390 --> 48:40.730]  No, I don't have code names
[48:40.730 --> 48:41.330]  for my hands.
[48:41.610 --> 48:43.910]  Alright, so first I should preheat the...
[48:43.910 --> 48:44.790]  thing, right?
[48:45.850 --> 48:48.350]  Yeah, it takes like 3 minutes to preheat.
[48:48.430 --> 48:50.110]  It's really quick and it's gonna smell terrible.
[48:50.610 --> 48:52.730]  It's gonna smell terrible as soon as you open it.
[48:53.010 --> 48:54.430]  That factory smell on the
[48:54.430 --> 48:56.150]  first one. I'm gonna get this prepped.
[48:57.010 --> 48:58.310]  Shit, let me get my extension.
[48:59.670 --> 49:00.590]  Open this.
[49:03.190 --> 49:04.110]  Up here.
[49:04.870 --> 49:06.150]  Alright, we have power.
[49:06.730 --> 49:08.190]  I opened this bacon
[49:08.190 --> 49:09.370]  in the dumbest way.
[49:09.810 --> 49:10.650]  With your meat hands?
[49:11.410 --> 49:13.230]  I wish I had my meat hands.
[49:14.450 --> 49:16.170]  Just so you know, I'm back.
[49:17.090 --> 49:17.870]  Welcome back.
[49:21.210 --> 49:22.710]  I'm gonna keep opening this bacon.
[49:22.710 --> 49:24.310]  Oh, it's fucking onion and bacon
[49:24.310 --> 49:25.390]  cheese all over my hands.
[49:26.310 --> 49:28.070]  My wife is... just so you know,
[49:28.170 --> 49:30.110]  my wife is so excited. Is she having one as well?
[49:30.490 --> 49:31.130]  Oh, it's great.
[49:31.670 --> 49:34.210]  I'm gonna make this and then I'll probably
[49:34.210 --> 49:36.530]  make more for her later because she loves...
[49:36.530 --> 49:37.950]  We have a waffle iron.
[49:38.170 --> 49:39.730]  An actual big waffle iron.
[49:40.290 --> 49:41.490]  Because she loves waffles.
[49:41.970 --> 49:44.210]  So when she saw a tiny waffle iron, she was...
[49:44.830 --> 49:46.170]  She said, tell Andrew
[49:46.170 --> 49:48.570]  that I say thank you for my tiny waffle iron.
[49:48.710 --> 49:49.510]  What's our ratio?
[49:49.730 --> 49:52.030]  One cup to how much powder?
[49:53.310 --> 49:54.370]  It's like the whole thing.
[49:54.590 --> 49:56.250]  One cup of water and then the whole thing.
[49:57.970 --> 49:59.850]  I don't think there's a way to make just a little.
[50:02.290 --> 50:03.250]  Let's uh...
[50:03.250 --> 50:04.250]  Cut my bacon.
[50:04.590 --> 50:05.570]  Gotta mix it up.
[50:08.430 --> 50:10.230]  Good tiny little bacon strip.
[50:10.770 --> 50:12.030]  So anyway, I'm gonna say
[50:12.030 --> 50:13.330]  because we're far enough into the podcast now.
[50:13.430 --> 50:15.810]  We should still definitely, despite Gavin's
[50:15.810 --> 50:17.650]  misgivings and Andrew's experiences,
[50:17.750 --> 50:19.690]  we definitely need to see if the
[50:19.690 --> 50:21.670]  Icy Hot works to raise our comedic level.
[50:22.110 --> 50:23.050]  But we'll just do it next week.
[50:23.630 --> 50:25.630]  Yeah, that sounds good.
[50:26.270 --> 50:28.130]  Well, next week, are we doing two episodes
[50:28.130 --> 50:29.810]  today? Because next week would be in two weeks.
[50:30.110 --> 50:32.430]  Like in two episodes,
[50:32.630 --> 50:34.430]  we will have the funniest episode of the podcast.
[50:35.290 --> 50:36.170]  I'm good with
[50:36.170 --> 50:37.790]  doing another episode after this.
[50:38.390 --> 50:39.190]  I can't.
[50:40.250 --> 50:41.550]  Then next week,
[50:41.730 --> 50:43.710]  there will be the funniest episode of the podcast.
[50:44.050 --> 50:46.030]  Oh, this thing smells so bad. Sorry, I just missed
[50:46.030 --> 50:48.090]  some discussion. Yeah, the first time.
[50:48.150 --> 50:49.470]  Yep, first time. It's terrible.
[50:49.530 --> 50:51.830]  Do I need to do anything after I plug it in?
[50:51.850 --> 50:52.890]  It just has a blue light.
[50:53.210 --> 50:54.110]  Oh, shit.
[50:54.110 --> 50:55.090]  Oh, shit.
[50:57.290 --> 50:57.930]  Oh, no.
[50:58.230 --> 50:59.330]  It sounds like it's sizzling.
[51:00.110 --> 51:00.830]  I need scissors.
[51:01.010 --> 51:06.100]  I got some bacon on the grill.
[51:06.480 --> 51:07.280]  Let me pour
[51:07.780 --> 51:09.660]  some waffle mix. My other one.
[51:12.120 --> 51:13.940]  How do I know when it's done?
[51:14.160 --> 51:15.280]  I guess it turns...
[51:16.000 --> 51:17.480]  It takes about five minutes.
[51:17.620 --> 51:19.760]  So whenever you put it in, just wait five or six minutes.
[51:20.060 --> 51:20.460]  Okay.
[51:22.080 --> 51:23.740]  I threw the instructions away.
[51:23.740 --> 51:25.660]  Alright, I'm adding
[51:25.660 --> 51:26.300]  to the water.
[51:26.740 --> 51:29.040]  I've already got my first one cooking here.
[51:29.560 --> 51:31.860]  Got my bacon on.
[51:32.040 --> 51:33.220]  Oh, it is a hot surface.
[51:33.300 --> 51:35.600]  It's not kidding. It gets really hot.
[51:35.860 --> 51:36.800]  So here's the thing.
[51:37.380 --> 51:39.820]  What if this changes our lives?
[51:40.940 --> 51:41.400]  It should.
[51:41.580 --> 51:42.200]  Like it did Andrew.
[51:43.140 --> 51:44.480]  That's what I'm hoping for.
[51:44.480 --> 51:46.660]  You know, hesitant,
[51:47.240 --> 51:48.620]  sort of reserved in this.
[51:48.920 --> 51:51.540]  I'm not really sure if this is going to be exactly what I'm looking for.
[51:51.540 --> 51:53.160]  But Andrew is really hoping
[51:53.160 --> 51:55.240]  that it's really going to make us different people.
[51:55.660 --> 51:56.820]  To the point where maybe
[51:56.820 --> 51:59.280]  at like 2.45 every Thursday
[51:59.280 --> 52:01.580]  we just start a waffle going before a recording.
[52:01.980 --> 52:04.020]  Are we a waffles only podcast now?
[52:05.580 --> 52:06.340]  Waffles only?
[52:06.700 --> 52:09.860]  I like it. We have to eat waffles every time we record.
[52:09.960 --> 52:11.140]  I'm giving mine a good whisk.
[52:11.860 --> 52:13.660]  Alright, it's smoking like a motherfucker.
[52:14.380 --> 52:15.280]  Yeah, it smokes.
[52:15.300 --> 52:16.520]  It's not smoking, it's steaming.
[52:17.480 --> 52:18.980]  It's steaming like a motherfucker.
[52:18.980 --> 52:20.960]  What should the viscosity be like?
[52:21.160 --> 52:22.720]  Mine looks quite liquidy.
[52:22.740 --> 52:24.920]  Oh, the light turned off.
[52:25.040 --> 52:25.400]  Oh!
[52:26.480 --> 52:27.620]  Let me take a photo.
[52:28.260 --> 52:29.240]  Mine just turned off too.
[52:29.680 --> 52:30.700]  I'm very excited.
[52:31.340 --> 52:33.240]  This one is heating, I believe.
[52:35.120 --> 52:37.080]  I think the light on means it's not
[52:37.080 --> 52:38.920]  heating, if I remember the instructions
[52:38.920 --> 52:39.440]  correctly.
[52:39.760 --> 52:41.160]  It's done, it's cooked as fuck.
[52:42.340 --> 52:44.940]  I assume when you open it, it will either turn the light on or off
[52:44.940 --> 52:46.160]  and then you wait the cycle out.
[52:47.160 --> 52:48.220]  Alright, let me know when
[52:48.220 --> 52:48.920]  everybody is ready to eat.
[52:49.300 --> 52:50.420]  I'm still whisking.
[52:50.820 --> 52:52.980]  It's so hot.
[52:53.980 --> 52:55.900]  It could get way crispier than that.
[52:56.560 --> 52:58.240]  That's a great first waffle.
[52:58.440 --> 52:59.820]  That's a great first waffle.
[53:00.220 --> 53:01.740]  I'll put it on for a little bit longer.
[53:02.160 --> 53:04.300]  You know what? I don't want it to be too much crispier
[53:04.300 --> 53:05.620]  because it'll hurt my mouth.
[53:06.520 --> 53:07.760]  Who would have seen this coming
[53:07.760 --> 53:10.200]  instead of us all putting Icy Hot on our nuts?
[53:11.640 --> 53:13.200]  I didn't see this coming.
[53:13.800 --> 53:14.580]  I was fully
[53:14.580 --> 53:15.860]  anticipating Icy Hot.
[53:16.180 --> 53:18.400]  I was like, your life is going to change tomorrow. Are you ready for this?
[53:19.100 --> 53:20.960]  I just assumed it would be from the Icy Hot.
[53:23.400 --> 53:24.780]  Alright, I think I'm ready for my first
[53:24.780 --> 53:26.660]  pour. Damn,
[53:26.700 --> 53:28.880]  that's hot! You haven't even poured yet?
[53:28.920 --> 53:30.200]  No, I was whisking still.
[53:31.620 --> 53:32.460]  I'm trying to get the
[53:32.460 --> 53:34.580]  viscosity right. Mine seems really runny.
[53:35.300 --> 53:37.020]  Yeah, I mean that's...
[53:37.020 --> 53:38.300]  Can I eat or should I wait for Gavin?
[53:38.680 --> 53:39.620]  No, I think you can.
[53:41.200 --> 53:42.620]  Can I ask how often
[53:42.620 --> 53:44.780]  you guys are making waffles and things like that
[53:44.780 --> 53:45.360]  in general?
[53:46.440 --> 53:46.840]  Never.
[53:48.080 --> 53:49.220]  Maybe once a month.
[53:50.080 --> 53:52.040]  I was doing it rarely before this.
[53:52.180 --> 53:53.960]  This has been every two days.
[53:54.080 --> 53:56.120]  So it's the guy who has 70 pounds of pancake mix.
[53:56.480 --> 53:58.780]  Yeah, I know, it's been a real issue, but now I got this.
[53:58.860 --> 54:00.400]  It's great. I've only ever used this stuff where you
[54:00.400 --> 54:02.400]  put the water in the yellow
[54:02.400 --> 54:03.580]  container and shake it up.
[54:04.480 --> 54:06.280]  Alright, I'm pouring now.
[54:07.300 --> 54:07.940]  Oh, it's good.
[54:08.640 --> 54:09.900]  Oh shit, look at that going.
[54:09.900 --> 54:11.940]  I'm gonna try and fill the
[54:11.940 --> 54:12.540]  crabs here.
[54:13.260 --> 54:15.140]  Okay, where's the drips gonna go though?
[54:15.260 --> 54:17.600]  Okay, whoopsie.
[54:18.220 --> 54:18.540]  Alright.
[54:19.840 --> 54:20.180]  You okay?
[54:21.220 --> 54:22.560]  I've put in too much.
[54:23.780 --> 54:24.980]  Oh shit.
[54:25.380 --> 54:26.620]  Less is more, buddy.
[54:27.200 --> 54:29.560]  Oh, my desk today.
[54:29.860 --> 54:30.580]  It's got
[54:31.700 --> 54:33.640]  bubbles, I've got spills,
[54:34.180 --> 54:34.880]  I've over-
[54:34.880 --> 54:37.020]  No! It's spewing!
[54:38.200 --> 54:39.680]  What does that mean?
[54:40.340 --> 54:41.240]  What do you mean?
[54:47.750 --> 54:49.030]  How are you doing, Geoff?
[54:49.250 --> 54:50.730]  Dude, I'm fucking great, I just had a waffle.
[54:51.030 --> 54:51.650]  Yeah, this is a great time.
[54:53.290 --> 54:55.110]  This is great, I'm gonna have
[54:55.110 --> 54:56.630]  tell Millie we're gonna have waffles for dinner.
[54:57.010 --> 54:58.870]  We're just gonna have breakfast for dinner tonight, this is awesome.
[54:59.190 --> 55:00.070]  I'm having a meh.
[55:01.930 --> 55:02.910]  What are you doing?
[55:03.870 --> 55:04.930]  I need to wash my
[55:04.930 --> 55:05.530]  hats again.
[55:06.190 --> 55:06.830]  Hahaha!
[55:08.750 --> 55:10.250]  You know what this tells me?
[55:10.970 --> 55:11.270]  What?
[55:11.530 --> 55:12.870]  It tells me we need to make
[55:13.430 --> 55:15.390]  our very own and sell
[55:16.150 --> 55:17.630]  regulation waffle maker.
[55:18.550 --> 55:18.750]  Mhm.
[55:19.230 --> 55:21.530]  Like a f*** face regulation waffle maker.
[55:22.330 --> 55:22.810]  That'd be great.
[55:23.310 --> 55:24.210]  Oh, Gavin!
[55:24.310 --> 55:25.930]  Oh, no!
[55:26.830 --> 55:28.590]  Oh, Gavin!
[55:28.590 --> 55:30.750]  You over-filmed it so much!
[55:31.050 --> 55:34.250]  Gavin just posted a photo of it all over his desk.
[55:34.830 --> 55:36.330]  It looks like the side
[55:36.330 --> 55:39.610]  of a french onion soup.
[55:42.990 --> 55:44.050]  I've botched it.
[55:44.310 --> 55:45.310]  That's a hard botch.
[55:45.810 --> 55:47.810]  It really is a small area.
[55:48.350 --> 55:49.150]  It doesn't take much.
[55:49.410 --> 55:50.850]  Oh, it's a tiny waffle, yeah.
[55:51.950 --> 55:53.890]  I'm excited to see how yours turns out.
[55:54.430 --> 55:56.250]  Dude, it is steaming away, this thing.
[55:56.790 --> 55:57.510]  Yeah, it's a steamer.
[55:57.950 --> 55:59.970]  You know what, though? Pretty soon you're gonna be in Flavor Land.
[56:00.210 --> 56:01.550]  And it's gonna all be worth it.
[56:01.550 --> 56:02.490]  How was yours?
[56:03.070 --> 56:04.530]  It was good. It was good. It was real good.
[56:04.990 --> 56:07.670]  It was crunchier on the bottom than the top.
[56:08.090 --> 56:09.490]  Like, the consistency was different.
[56:09.750 --> 56:10.850]  But I'm sure you just
[56:11.390 --> 56:12.770]  figure it out as you go, you know?
[56:15.090 --> 56:15.610]  Oh, yeah.
[56:15.690 --> 56:16.890]  You definitely need to take some attempts.
[56:17.390 --> 56:18.970]  Okay, the light has gone off.
[56:19.510 --> 56:20.950]  I would let it sit for a little bit longer.
[56:21.150 --> 56:21.790]  There you go.
[56:22.630 --> 56:24.110]  It's, like, glued shut.
[56:25.030 --> 56:27.770]  Well, it literally is glued shut because of
[56:27.770 --> 56:28.990]  you over-filled it.
[56:28.990 --> 56:30.030]  Okay, come on now.
[56:30.810 --> 56:31.810]  Get out of there.
[56:32.330 --> 56:33.650]  Oh, ow!
[56:34.910 --> 56:36.030]  Look at that.
[56:37.450 --> 56:37.890]  Yeah?
[56:39.050 --> 56:40.530]  I would love to look at it.
[56:40.730 --> 56:43.030]  I wish I had a phone that I could take a photo
[56:43.030 --> 56:43.630]  with if you don't mind.
[56:43.950 --> 56:46.670]  I'm gonna have to trim off the extensions.
[56:47.610 --> 56:48.530]  I gotta say, Andrew,
[56:48.690 --> 56:49.970]  you really brought it this week.
[56:51.050 --> 56:51.930]  Dubox, waffles,
[56:52.990 --> 56:54.750]  fucking Icy Hot and Triplicate.
[56:55.150 --> 56:56.270]  Yeah, I just, you know,
[56:56.270 --> 56:58.470]  I wanted to end it with Dubox.
[56:58.490 --> 57:00.070]  Dubox was great. I just wish there was,
[57:00.510 --> 57:02.470]  um, I wish it was slightly more efficient.
[57:02.830 --> 57:04.270]  I did have to order a six-pack
[57:04.270 --> 57:05.730]  of bubbles and whoopie cushions.
[57:06.110 --> 57:08.770]  I did provide a link in our Slack for a singular one.
[57:09.510 --> 57:10.230]  Oh, you did?
[57:10.390 --> 57:11.350]  Yeah, I didn't use that.
[57:11.790 --> 57:13.930]  I gotta say, Gav, mess aside,
[57:14.010 --> 57:15.230]  that's a gorgeous-looking waffle.
[57:15.750 --> 57:16.830]  That looks really good.
[57:16.850 --> 57:19.610]  It really does. Beautiful waffle.
[57:19.850 --> 57:20.610]  I don't know how to get it out.
[57:21.610 --> 57:22.890]  That was difficult for me.
[57:22.890 --> 57:23.750]  Do you have anything to get it with?
[57:24.850 --> 57:26.070]  Where's my whisking fork?
[57:26.170 --> 57:27.010]  Oh, it's covered in batter.
[57:29.170 --> 57:30.150]  Scissors is a good move.
[57:30.350 --> 57:31.790]  I used the twist tie
[57:31.790 --> 57:34.770]  that tied up the cord
[57:34.770 --> 57:36.790]  for the waffle maker to kind of poke it out.
[57:37.150 --> 57:37.930]  The bacon's delicious.
[57:38.510 --> 57:39.630]  The skillet was a great idea.
[57:40.490 --> 57:41.930]  There's no way for you to send us a photo, huh?
[57:41.950 --> 57:43.050]  You have like a pocket skillet.
[57:44.370 --> 57:46.010]  When I get my camera, I'll send a photo.
[57:46.250 --> 57:47.450]  How much room is on it?
[57:47.750 --> 57:50.490]  Could you cook two pieces of bacon?
[57:50.490 --> 57:51.170]  Is that max?
[57:51.510 --> 57:53.750]  No, I was able to cook
[57:53.750 --> 57:55.630]  a third of one strip.
[57:55.890 --> 57:57.650]  Oh, it's that small.
[57:58.170 --> 57:59.170]  I want to see that.
[57:59.650 --> 58:02.210]  Are you meant to burn the first waffle to get the factory
[58:02.210 --> 58:04.410]  chemicals off, or am I just going to eat this?
[58:04.830 --> 58:06.170]  You're just going to eat the chemicals.
[58:06.590 --> 58:06.870]  It's fine.
[58:07.210 --> 58:08.850]  This won't be what kills you.
[58:11.730 --> 58:12.170]  Oh.
[58:13.890 --> 58:14.930]  Okay. Whoops.
[58:17.890 --> 58:18.750]  That's pretty good.
[58:19.670 --> 58:19.950]  Yeah?
[58:20.970 --> 58:23.190]  It's actually not the best presentation,
[58:23.310 --> 58:23.970]  but that's a good waffle.
[58:27.070 --> 58:29.350]  I think there's improvements that can be made
[58:29.350 --> 58:31.210]  in your waffle game, as far as
[58:31.210 --> 58:32.570]  the pour goes, but you made a great cook.
[58:32.910 --> 58:33.950]  That was a great first cook.
[58:34.170 --> 58:37.070]  As far as first waffles go, I think you did admirably.
[58:37.070 --> 58:39.570]  As far as first waffles go,
[58:39.690 --> 58:41.270]  if you ate a waffle, you did it right.
[58:44.410 --> 58:45.090]  I'll be honest,
[58:45.090 --> 58:47.090]  I took a look at Geoff's, and I thought,
[58:47.170 --> 58:49.230]  I can fill the area a little bit better than that.
[58:49.410 --> 58:50.670]  And then, uh...
[58:50.670 --> 58:52.430]  No, I was very cautious, because
[58:53.410 --> 58:55.390]  I've used a waffle maker before a few times.
[58:58.330 --> 58:59.050]  This is great.
[58:59.610 --> 59:01.110]  Being able to share the waffle experience.
[59:01.210 --> 59:02.530]  Would you say you've been moved?
[59:02.790 --> 59:04.650]  Are you more open to the idea
[59:05.510 --> 59:06.610]  of desk cooking?
[59:06.970 --> 59:08.610]  Yes, I'm more open to it.
[59:09.110 --> 59:10.570]  I don't know that my life has
[59:11.470 --> 59:12.190]  changed yet,
[59:13.290 --> 59:14.410]  but next Thursday,
[59:14.630 --> 59:15.790]  when we roll around,
[59:16.410 --> 59:18.910]  if I feel inclined to make a waffle,
[59:19.050 --> 59:20.390]  I think I'll start to see it in practice,
[59:20.550 --> 59:22.870]  maybe after the newness
[59:22.870 --> 59:23.670]  has worn off a little bit.
[59:24.330 --> 59:26.070]  I don't think it's changed my life, and I'll tell you why.
[59:26.250 --> 59:28.230]  I had to run to the kitchen five times
[59:28.230 --> 59:29.330]  in the process.
[59:29.750 --> 59:31.790]  Yeah, but you're kind of dumb like that.
[59:34.690 --> 59:37.890]  Like, I didn't have to run to the...
[59:37.890 --> 59:38.670]  I went once.
[59:39.110 --> 59:40.150]  Like, you know.
[59:40.490 --> 59:42.870]  I'm just gonna... I got the ideal setup for it.
[59:42.870 --> 59:44.290]  I got my little fridge next to it,
[59:44.350 --> 59:46.570]  so I fill up all my batter ahead of time in a bottle,
[59:46.790 --> 59:48.690]  and I just pour when I need to.
[59:48.830 --> 59:49.350]  It's perfect.
[59:49.490 --> 59:52.950]  Oh, I tell you something, the underside really carries that factory taste.
[59:56.570 --> 59:58.310]  I will say, I don't know if...
[59:58.310 --> 59:59.810]  I really enjoy this.
[01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:00.990]  Where's your pictures, Eric?
[01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.890]  I'm sorry?
[01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:04.110]  Oh, hang on. Let me take a picture.
[01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:06.970]  I don't know if, you know,
[01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:09.050]  this is the thing for me.
[01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:10.530]  I do enjoy it.
[01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:11.390]  I think it's nice.
[01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:15.050]  However, my dog is thrilled
[01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:15.790]  about
[01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.710]  everything that's happening right now.
[01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:21.110]  He is excited that it smells
[01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:23.050]  like waffles in a place that doesn't typically
[01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:23.810]  smell like waffles.
[01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:25.530]  So, that's mine.
[01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:27.930]  Thank you so much.
[01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:29.810]  You don't think
[01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:32.330]  if you took this to work, and you threw it on your desk
[01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:33.770]  at the day job, and like
[01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:36.050]  Patrick Salazar walked by and he saw it, he wouldn't be like
[01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:38.070]  holy shit, Eric, this is innovative.
[01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:38.810]  You're brilliant.
[01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:41.610]  I'll take all the credit in the world for it, sure.
[01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:42.650]  I got no problem with that.
[01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.710]  You know,
[01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:46.890]  I think
[01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:50.150]  it's a great idea if I
[01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:51.510]  use this at
[01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:54.230]  the office at work. In my home office,
[01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:56.210]  I don't know if
[01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:58.130]  it's a home office use
[01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:59.510]  for me. Does that make sense?
[01:00:59.690 --> 01:00:59.910]  Yeah.
[01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:04.150]  That looks great. That's a really pretty waffle.
[01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:05.410]  Is that the first one?
[01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:08.190]  I've just been letting it go all this
[01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.490]  time.
[01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:12.050]  It feels undercooked a little bit,
[01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:14.070]  but I think it's starting to brown up,
[01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:14.670]  get crispy.
[01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:18.010]  I will say that Nix is still
[01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:19.790]  at his desk at the office,
[01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:22.010]  so he could be the hero to
[01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:24.110]  the entire post room and just be
[01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:25.090]  doling out
[01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:26.010]  waffles.
[01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.050]  What did your small wife think about it?
[01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:31.850]  Oh, she's thrilled. She can't wait.
[01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:33.670]  I mean, as soon as I'm...
[01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:34.530]  Oh my God, Gavin.
[01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.790]  Gavin.
[01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:39.890]  I will say
[01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:41.890]  that that picture that you sent
[01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:43.430]  looks like what I imagine
[01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:45.930]  Andrew's desk is like all the time.
[01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:46.410]  Yeah.
[01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:48.750]  He's turning me into Andrew.
[01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:51.690]  It's like Gavin's desk
[01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:53.690]  is cosplaying Andrew's desk right now.
[01:01:58.110 --> 01:01:59.490]  Of course, Gavin,
[01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:01.630]  your keyboard appears to be on and working, so it
[01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:02.950]  clearly couldn't be Andrew's.
[01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:03.670]  That's true.
[01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:07.370]  What did you end up doing, by the way, with your keyboard?
[01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.570]  I swapped out. I used
[01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:11.590]  the keyboard, a different plug-in
[01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:13.450]  keyboard. I haven't tried it since.
[01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:14.610]  I think it's pretty fucked.
[01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:17.550]  So not a great couple of weeks for technology in you.
[01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:19.670]  Oh, terrible, terrible
[01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:21.170]  stretch of technology for me.
[01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:22.230]  What's your new phone going to be?
[01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:25.130]  I'm just getting another...
[01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:27.350]  It's a refurbished Google Pixel.
[01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:28.230]  Okay.
[01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:31.150]  Same idea, but new phone.
[01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:33.050]  How long do you think
[01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:34.090]  before you put it in the tub?
[01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:37.090]  Almost maybe a week.
[01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:39.370]  At best. We're hoping. We're hoping for two.
[01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:41.150]  But probably a week.
[01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:43.550]  I have a
[01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:45.250]  confession. I have a thing to say.
[01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:47.350]  Now that we've had our delicious
[01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:49.530]  nice waffle times, that was very sweet.
[01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:51.270]  I need to
[01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:53.350]  confess and say that I have
[01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:55.510]  recorded this entire show
[01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:56.510]  with all of you.
[01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:59.370]  With my ears coated in icy hot
[01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:01.190]  to see if I would focus better
[01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:02.610]  as part of the experiment.
[01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:05.250]  This has been a grueling endeavor
[01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:07.310]  to get through. There have been times
[01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:09.010]  where I have winced randomly
[01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:10.170]  when people are talking.
[01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:13.230]  I'd like to say that this stage
[01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:14.370]  didn't work at all.
[01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:15.090]  No, disagree.
[01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:17.130]  Hard disagree.
[01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:20.430]  Dude, you were on fire.
[01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:21.530]  This episode.
[01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:23.730]  You're gonna hate this.
[01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:26.330]  This is an old timer Andrew episode.
[01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:27.670]  Period. I understand.
[01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:30.910]  But it was the prep I did going into it.
[01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:32.450]  It had nothing to do
[01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:33.970]  with what was happening.
[01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:35.010]  You nailed it.
[01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:35.710]  I'm telling you.
[01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:39.270]  It was a little sloppy.
[01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:41.390]  Go ahead.
[01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:43.210]  Here's what my review
[01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.750]  had Andrew not said this last part.
[01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:45.710]  My review would have been
[01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:49.650]  A. Fucking great A. A++ episode.
[01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:51.770]  Andrew was on today.
[01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:53.530]  He was like sharp.
[01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:55.630]  He was like quick to respond.
[01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:57.090]  He was with it.
[01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:58.870]  He was funny. He was clear.
[01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:00.930]  He was like firing on all cylinders.
[01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:03.770]  This is like an all time great Andrew episode.
[01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:05.370]  And now I know why.
[01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:07.390]  All time Andrew episode. All time.
[01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:08.730]  I don't think it had anything...
[01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:10.870]  I found it hard to listen at points
[01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:12.790]  when you were talking because my ears
[01:04:12.790 --> 01:04:14.910]  were on fire. All I could smell
[01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:16.790]  was icy hot. I put way
[01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:18.470]  too much on. It went in my ear hole.
[01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:19.850]  It was terrible experience.
[01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:22.950]  I've been struggling this whole show.
[01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:24.690]  But I guess apparently
[01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:26.690]  if it works I just move on.
[01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:28.730]  You know what? I'm going to be funnier
[01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:30.150]  than both of you during the final episode.
[01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:32.990]  Give me the tiger bomb. Let's get this tiger bomb going.
[01:04:33.850 --> 01:04:34.570]  That's true.
[01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:37.030]  I'm going to have to really lather up
[01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:37.670]  next episode.
[01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:41.230]  Talk about
[01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:43.030]  jumping the gun. I'm still going to do the
[01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:44.650]  icy hot on my balls next week.
[01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:47.250]  I was joking about shoveling it onto the beginning.
[01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:48.470]  I should have.
[01:04:49.030 --> 01:04:51.370]  Andrew, you've done it right at the end of the episode.
[01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:52.730]  The payoff is...
[01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:53.130]  Oh no!
[01:04:55.610 --> 01:04:56.570]  Oh god!
[01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:57.750]  It's so hot!
[01:04:58.930 --> 01:04:59.990]  I know that feeling.
[01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:02.590]  I know exactly that feeling.
[01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:04.450]  Are we in his bathroom?
[01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:05.950]  Where's he getting all this water from?
[01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:08.350]  He's in for a really shitty
[01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:10.390]  45 minutes. Probably.
[01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:17.610]  Where did he rub it?
[01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:22.810]  I think he put it on his balls.
[01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:24.130]  It's on his ears and his balls.
[01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:30.650]  He's triple funny.
[01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:34.510]  It sounds like he's doing
[01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:35.070]  efforts.
[01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:40.030]  Here's what we're going to do.
[01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:42.790]  We're going to let Andrew's comedy
[01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:44.630]  play us out. Thanks for listening to another
[01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:46.770]  episode of F*** Face. This is episode 127.
[01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:48.850]  We leave you with Andrew.
[01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:56.230]  Oh man!
[01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:59.170]  I don't feel any funnier!
[01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:01.390]  I don't feel any funnier!
[01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:06.310]  Now it's cold!
[01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:07.730]  It's cold!
[01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:10.650]  This is a mistake!
[01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:12.010]  Why did I do this?
[01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:14.530]  The waffle's so good!
[01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:15.790]  The ball!
[01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:28.670]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack
[01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:30.630]  here with a look at next week's episode of
[01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:32.430]  F*** Face. We get some deep
[01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:34.570]  pencil lore. What is our jokes per
[01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:36.410]  minute count? It's time for the
[01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:38.630]  icy hot. Gavin goes to all
[01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:40.490]  fours. Penn's keyboard is
[01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:42.650]  still broken. There's just too much
[01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:44.550]  CO2. And once again,
[01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:46.650]  Andrew does not eat the pencil. All
[01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:48.590]  that and more on next week's episode of
[01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:49.130]  F*** Face.
