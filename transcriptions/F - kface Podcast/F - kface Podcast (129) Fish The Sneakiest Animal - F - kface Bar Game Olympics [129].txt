[00:14.710 --> 00:18.590]  Well, I'm most surprised by things attacking me in the sea.
[00:19.010 --> 00:22.110]  What? That's just because you have limited visibility.
[00:22.530 --> 00:23.850]  That's exactly what I said.
[00:24.350 --> 00:26.210]  Exactly, I agree. I'm agreeing with that.
[00:26.610 --> 00:31.590]  It's just because, that's not sneaky on the animals part, it's dumb on your part for being in their environment.
[00:32.170 --> 00:34.170]  Oh, so it's dumb to be in the ocean.
[00:34.670 --> 00:36.490]  Oh yeah, it's absolutely dumb to be in the ocean.
[00:36.490 --> 00:44.290]  No, I think being in the ocean is awesome, but if you're concerned about being snuck up on by an ocean animal,
[00:44.870 --> 00:45.970]  then yeah, don't go to the ocean.
[00:46.370 --> 00:50.330]  If you're okay with it, if you accept the risk, then you're totally fine.
[00:50.350 --> 00:53.670]  Yeah, no, I'm not saying I'm concerned by it, I'm just saying that it's a high probability.
[00:53.770 --> 00:56.830]  If something were to come up, I wouldn't expect it. It would surprise me.
[00:57.130 --> 01:01.410]  I just don't think that if you were to search what's the sneakiest animal, it would say fish.
[01:01.690 --> 01:02.490]  No, I agree.
[01:02.490 --> 01:05.970]  I also think that... I think that...
[01:07.370 --> 01:09.410]  See, you think it's...
[01:09.410 --> 01:12.950]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:13.010 --> 01:18.850]  With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey. I believe this is episode 129, correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:19.110 --> 01:19.630]  That is correct.
[01:19.910 --> 01:27.070]  Here's the deal. You think being snuck up on in the ocean, you would be caught off guard and surprised by being snuck up on the ocean by a fish,
[01:27.070 --> 01:32.910]  because your neck is always going to be... In this scenario, you're imagining your neck is above water and you're not looking at your feet.
[01:33.090 --> 01:39.690]  If you were to walk around with a piece of cardboard around your neck sticking out so that you couldn't see your feet as you walk down the street,
[01:39.830 --> 01:46.290]  you would be just as surprised by a squirrel or a bird or a rat or a dog or a cat attacking you.
[01:46.430 --> 01:48.650]  It's purely a peripheral vision thing.
[01:48.650 --> 01:57.590]  No, absolutely. But the question was, what is the sneakiest animal? And I was thinking that 100% of animal interactions I've had in the sea, I'd categorize as sneaky.
[01:57.730 --> 02:00.310]  I never saw it coming. As opposed to land.
[02:00.770 --> 02:07.310]  I think they have a distinct advantage. I'm not saying it's because of the animal itself, but their environment gives them an upper edge in sneakiness.
[02:07.690 --> 02:14.790]  Now, see, I would argue that the hardest place on Earth to be snuck up on is the ocean, if you're underwater with goggles on,
[02:14.790 --> 02:22.790]  because you can see 365 degrees around you at all times. Whereas if you're in the woods or the jungle or even in a neighborhood, there's a million places for animals to hide.
[02:23.430 --> 02:26.830]  You can see 360... that's like all the way around, plus a little bit more.
[02:27.130 --> 02:28.990]  Yeah, you just gotta do a flip or a turn.
[02:30.070 --> 02:34.830]  There's nothing around you impairing your vision. It's just open water and animals.
[02:35.090 --> 02:38.430]  Yeah, you can see 24-7 degrees around.
[02:38.950 --> 02:44.810]  I'm arguing against your point, though, because your stance is essentially, if you're prepared to not be snuck up on, you will not be snuck up on.
[02:44.870 --> 02:46.850]  I don't know what that proves. Your statement.
[02:47.510 --> 02:51.650]  I just think if you stick your head above anything, then you're in the same situation.
[02:52.370 --> 02:53.170]  There's nothing gonna sneak up on me in the jungle.
[02:53.170 --> 02:54.810]  So I don't think it has anything to do with a fish.
[02:55.250 --> 03:00.150]  I just think if you can say a coyote is sneakier than a fish, then a fish isn't gonna be the sneakiest animal.
[03:00.450 --> 03:02.330]  And a coyote's definitely sneakier than a fish.
[03:02.710 --> 03:03.550]  Oh, 100%.
[03:03.550 --> 03:03.990]  Yeah.
[03:04.410 --> 03:05.910]  Hey, real quick, what's Swiper?
[03:06.610 --> 03:07.470]  He's a fox, right?
[03:07.470 --> 03:08.010]  He's a fox, yeah.
[03:08.390 --> 03:10.130]  He's the sneakiest animal on Earth, right there.
[03:10.470 --> 03:13.570]  Swiper is... his whole job is being sneaky, and he's a fox.
[03:13.610 --> 03:15.910]  So I would say the fox is the sneakiest animal.
[03:16.310 --> 03:18.130]  Gavin, any thoughts on the sneakiest animal?
[03:18.750 --> 03:19.630]  Uh, anglerfish.
[03:20.390 --> 03:23.530]  That's a fish! You think an anglerfish is the sneakiest animal?
[03:24.050 --> 03:26.350]  You're like, ooh, after that bright light, and then...
[03:27.270 --> 03:28.490]  That's a great point!
[03:29.350 --> 03:32.470]  That's an animal that makes you think it's something it's not.
[03:32.470 --> 03:37.050]  Can we name another animal that's just big, and there, and dark, and you can't...
[03:37.050 --> 03:40.190]  It's... if anything, it's the scariest thing on the planet.
[03:40.250 --> 03:43.290]  Could you imagine if you thought you were looking at, like, a Subaru, and then it ate you?
[03:43.550 --> 03:44.390]  That'd be terrifying.
[03:44.650 --> 03:53.570]  I think that if you can say a skunk is sneakier than, like, any of these fish, then a fish isn't on this list.
[03:53.650 --> 03:55.670]  And a skunk is way sneakier than any of these fish.
[03:56.330 --> 03:59.430]  A skunk doesn't dangle shit that you want in front of it, though.
[03:59.570 --> 04:00.590]  No, but it's sneaky!
[04:01.310 --> 04:02.970]  I don't know if a skunk is sneaky.
[04:03.150 --> 04:05.150]  I also don't think their intent is sneaky.
[04:05.370 --> 04:10.030]  So you're talking about the act of sneaking, not the act of, like, being ambushed.
[04:10.070 --> 04:11.270]  I'm trying to figure this out myself.
[04:11.270 --> 04:14.970]  I don't think anybody said anything about being ambushed, I just said, what's the sneakiest animal?
[04:15.430 --> 04:17.390]  Yeah, I definitely don't want to be ambushed by skunks.
[04:18.170 --> 04:18.490]  See?
[04:19.170 --> 04:20.010]  That's a tough one.
[04:20.650 --> 04:21.010]  Although...
[04:21.010 --> 04:26.150]  So here's the thing, I posed this, this is before we started recording, I posed this to Andrew, and then he said fish,
[04:26.210 --> 04:28.330]  and I said, I don't know about fish, I think it's mostly the environment.
[04:28.330 --> 04:32.330]  He said, okay, so we're taking all animals and putting them on the same plane.
[04:32.430 --> 04:37.650]  And I don't agree with that, because that eliminates all birds and all fish.
[04:38.050 --> 04:39.070]  It doesn't make any sense.
[04:39.150 --> 04:41.030]  I just don't think a fish is the sneakiest animal.
[04:41.330 --> 04:48.450]  Well, also, for Gavin to be snuck up on by an anglerfish, his bones would have compressed and crushed well before that,
[04:48.510 --> 04:50.910]  because they're like a thousand feet underwater, right?
[04:51.470 --> 04:56.050]  Like, there's never a scenario where you and an anglerfish are going to be in the same location, and alive.
[04:56.050 --> 04:59.810]  It's so far down that sunlight doesn't reach the area.
[05:00.390 --> 05:00.910]  They could travel.
[05:02.530 --> 05:03.470]  Why can't they?
[05:04.170 --> 05:09.510]  You got a curious anglerfish, it can't come up to the surface, it's not allowed, is there anything that prevents that from happening?
[05:09.810 --> 05:10.870]  It'd probably explode.
[05:11.610 --> 05:12.010]  Really?
[05:12.570 --> 05:13.230]  I don't know.
[05:13.730 --> 05:14.590]  I hope so.
[05:15.070 --> 05:21.270]  If it's meant for super high pressure, then you bring it into a low-pressure environment, wouldn't it just, like, all that shit leak out?
[05:21.510 --> 05:21.710]  I don't know.
[05:21.710 --> 05:26.870]  I hope so. I don't want to create a scenario in which I could find an anglerfish just while I'm walking on the beach.
[05:27.450 --> 05:31.490]  If we could choose anglerfish, then I'm going to pick the scariest animal on Earth.
[05:31.810 --> 05:34.810]  Or, no, sorry, the scariest animal in the universe is a space worm.
[05:35.130 --> 05:45.210]  Because I've never seen a space worm, but worms are everywhere, and I guarantee you somewhere in space, in the infinite of space, there are space worms, and they're fucking wiggling around right now and you'll never see them coming.
[05:46.010 --> 05:46.570]  That's true.
[05:46.890 --> 05:47.970]  We went, like, microscopic.
[05:48.490 --> 05:48.630]  Yeah.
[05:49.150 --> 05:49.350]  Yeah.
[05:49.510 --> 05:50.190]  That's a great example.
[05:50.710 --> 05:56.970]  I always thought fish were dumb for falling for the anglerfish trap, but thinking about it, I think I would fall for that.
[05:57.510 --> 06:01.810]  If there was just, like, a light in the sky I wasn't expecting, I'd definitely get eaten by that.
[06:02.330 --> 06:07.230]  Well, plus there's never any light, right? So it's like, you're just swimming along in the darkness.
[06:07.590 --> 06:08.230]  That's true.
[06:08.330 --> 06:12.830]  And then suddenly the world looks different in a way it never has before.
[06:13.910 --> 06:15.070]  That'd be pretty jarring.
[06:15.570 --> 06:15.850]  Yeah.
[06:16.050 --> 06:16.350]  I have a question.
[06:16.850 --> 06:17.110]  Okay.
[06:17.230 --> 06:18.710]  What are you guys on about?
[06:18.710 --> 06:20.910]  Eric asked what the sneakiest animal is.
[06:21.150 --> 06:21.950]  Why are you asking that, Eric?
[06:21.950 --> 06:26.610]  Yeah, we were just having pleasantries, and I just asked about what the sneakiest animal is, because I think it's probably some kind of cat.
[06:27.050 --> 06:29.290]  And then Andrew said fish, and now here we are.
[06:29.530 --> 06:32.250]  You made a good point in that the pink panther was very sneaky.
[06:32.830 --> 06:33.470]  That's true.
[06:33.990 --> 06:35.410]  Well, he was an international jewel thief.
[06:35.910 --> 06:41.070]  I popped in, Gavin, when Andrew was explaining that he thinks he can sneak up on an owl.
[06:43.410 --> 06:44.090]  I could.
[06:44.990 --> 06:51.010]  That was my argument against... because Eric said an owl is sneakier than a fish, and I was saying I don't think there's any way in hell...
[06:51.010 --> 06:53.790]  An owl might be the greatest anti-sneak device.
[06:54.070 --> 06:55.230]  Have you seen all around?
[06:55.550 --> 06:56.310]  That's what I said.
[06:56.670 --> 07:01.390]  I think I said 365 days instead of 360 degrees.
[07:01.690 --> 07:03.410]  But, like, an owl can see anywhere.
[07:03.930 --> 07:05.050]  Have you seen me try to sneak?
[07:05.610 --> 07:10.630]  I would say that with your ankle dexterity, you might be one of the worst sneakers on the planet.
[07:10.630 --> 07:12.530]  No, answer the question. Have you seen me try to sneak?
[07:13.030 --> 07:13.210]  No.
[07:13.790 --> 07:14.970]  Exactly. That's how good I am.
[07:15.110 --> 07:22.810]  Andrew, you can hardly walk with your ankles. I don't understand how you're sneaking. Are you, like, belly crawling? Like, what are you talking about?
[07:22.890 --> 07:26.950]  Listen, you don't need to question the form. You just are not gonna know I'm there. I'm in and out.
[07:27.330 --> 07:36.870]  You explained how you tried to sneak Chinese food menus onto doors in a neighborhood to steal your own package back, and it didn't sound very stealthy to me, buddy.
[07:36.870 --> 07:45.450]  I've sat in a room that Gavin walked through, and he didn't see me once. This is why my sneaking has established that I wasn't even trying in that moment.
[07:45.670 --> 07:53.330]  Being already in the room, does it? If you're there trying to steal the Pink Panther diamond, and you're already next to the diamond, that's not the sneaky part.
[07:53.610 --> 08:00.010]  No, that's brilliant. He wins the argument right there. I think you're right. You blended into the environment, and nobody noticed you.
[08:00.230 --> 08:03.730]  But you had to walk in on your busted ankles to get in there.
[08:04.270 --> 08:05.530]  And you never saw it happen, did you, Gavin?
[08:05.530 --> 08:07.250]  You're not sneaky, you're just early.
[08:07.850 --> 08:08.290]  No.
[08:11.270 --> 08:12.150]  That's rude.
[08:12.790 --> 08:15.870]  Being early is a pretty sneaky technique, though, isn't it?
[08:15.870 --> 08:20.250]  Yeah, I'm gonna rob a bank by standing in the spot the bank will eventually be built on.
[08:22.690 --> 08:27.570]  What would be the problem? I mean, obviously, that's a ridiculous scenario. You can't be mad at people being early.
[08:28.070 --> 08:33.670]  Nobody's complaining about early. No one's been robbed and complained that they weren't there, like, in the right time.
[08:33.670 --> 08:41.370]  Home Alone 2, they robbed Duncan's toy chest by getting there early. They didn't sneak in.
[08:41.790 --> 08:43.530]  Well, that's pretty sneaky. I will say-
[08:43.530 --> 08:44.490]  That's an act of sneaking.
[08:45.070 --> 08:50.330]  Yeah. A more appropriate analogy, Gavin, would be, I'm gonna stand where I think they're gonna build a bank.
[08:50.650 --> 08:59.910]  It would be, I get to the bank right as they open, and then I stand so still all day long that the bank closes around me and nobody notices me anymore because I've blended into the environment.
[09:00.190 --> 09:02.190]  As soon as the lights turn off, then you go and you rob it.
[09:05.140 --> 09:10.620]  I can't wait to sneak up on Gavin at some point. You're gonna be shocked. You're gonna be stunned by my sneaking abilities.
[09:11.340 --> 09:16.640]  When we're next together in person, your challenge is to tap me on the back without me knowing you're there.
[09:17.040 --> 09:23.780]  Easy. Easy. I'm gonna have to bring a camera because you're not even gonna feel it. You're not even gonna know it happened.
[09:24.580 --> 09:25.060]  That's a sneaky idea.
[09:25.060 --> 09:27.720]  That's a picture of you touching my back and I wouldn't even know that it happened.
[09:27.720 --> 09:31.680]  Yeah. I'm also gonna take your wallet and your watch.
[09:32.260 --> 09:33.780]  Hang on. Hang on.
[09:33.780 --> 09:34.620]  I'm just gonna rob you.
[09:34.620 --> 09:37.840]  Hang on. You're gonna rob Gavin?
[09:38.500 --> 09:43.380]  Just to illustrate a point. Not because I want to, but because he's...
[09:45.240 --> 09:47.680]  I don't wanna rob from you, but you're an idiot.
[09:48.060 --> 09:49.420]  Let me show you how sneaky I am.
[09:49.640 --> 09:54.460]  I'm gonna tape a hundred dollar bill to my back and you're not gonna be able to get anywhere near it.
[09:54.460 --> 10:02.120]  Oh, you're gonna be like, oh wow, this back, you didn't do anything Andrew, you're gonna go back there, it's gonna be fucking Monopoly money, it's gonna be gone, I'm gonna do switcheroo on you.
[10:02.620 --> 10:05.300]  I'm gonna replace it with some Monopoly money.
[10:05.780 --> 10:09.900]  I went through a magic phase between the ages of 8 and 12, okay? I know my sleight of hand.
[10:10.460 --> 10:11.420]  I could palm coins.
[10:12.600 --> 10:14.220]  You went through a magic phase?
[10:14.360 --> 10:15.560]  Oh, big magic phase.
[10:16.020 --> 10:17.040]  Yeah. Yeah.
[10:17.180 --> 10:18.580]  Was that before or after the sneaking phase?
[10:18.980 --> 10:21.160]  Uh, it was all part of it. It just built onto it.
[10:21.360 --> 10:21.680]  Okay.
[10:21.680 --> 10:23.000]  It was built onto it, yeah.
[10:23.260 --> 10:27.200]  I can levitate if you stand at a specific angle and don't ask any questions.
[10:28.180 --> 10:33.100]  I don't know, that takes a lot of single ankle strength. I'm not sure you can still do that.
[10:33.320 --> 10:35.160]  Oh, no, no, I definitely can't.
[10:36.560 --> 10:42.520]  I was the worst magician of all time because I would get too excited and I wouldn't practice the tricks enough and they'd never work.
[10:42.940 --> 10:48.700]  And if they did work, I would do them back to back and then it would just be obvious how it worked.
[10:48.700 --> 10:54.700]  So you're going to draw upon your skills as the four-year-long worst magician ever?
[10:55.260 --> 10:56.580]  Yeah. Yeah, I am.
[10:57.500 --> 10:58.780]  That's all part of the illusion.
[10:59.220 --> 11:00.520]  Think of a card right now, Gavin.
[11:01.660 --> 11:02.900]  No, don't say it.
[11:03.740 --> 11:05.700]  No, I was halfway through making a different joke.
[11:05.960 --> 11:08.060]  Okay. Think of a card. Any card.
[11:08.840 --> 11:09.200]  Okay.
[11:10.380 --> 11:11.900]  Do you have it in your head? Do you have the suit?
[11:11.960 --> 11:12.540]  I've got it.
[11:13.960 --> 11:15.080]  Nine of diamonds.
[11:16.200 --> 11:17.960]  Uh, shockingly close, but no.
[11:18.900 --> 11:20.980]  But if I was right, though...
[11:20.980 --> 11:23.180]  Seven?! You were two off?!
[11:23.180 --> 11:23.700]  That's pretty good.
[11:23.900 --> 11:26.080]  A seven and a nine even look like cousins.
[11:26.520 --> 11:29.080]  Wait, how did that trick work, Andrew?
[11:29.240 --> 11:30.580]  Like, what was the trick there?
[11:30.680 --> 11:33.220]  That was just you picking... you had a one in 52 chance?
[11:33.300 --> 11:35.460]  Yeah, if I would have got it, it would have been pretty cool.
[11:36.000 --> 11:36.640]  I'm pretty close.
[11:36.860 --> 11:39.080]  Honestly, that was slightly worrying that you got so close.
[11:39.220 --> 11:43.020]  If this was a golf game, I'm in perfect setup for a birdie right now.
[11:43.200 --> 11:44.320]  I consider this a win.
[11:44.660 --> 11:45.840]  I'm right next to the hole.
[11:45.840 --> 11:46.760]  Didn't get in it.
[11:47.040 --> 11:50.100]  Why were you talking to me about darts the other day, by the way?
[11:50.380 --> 11:51.620]  Oh, I was just thinking about darts.
[11:51.740 --> 11:54.040]  I have a friend who got into darts, and I'm terrible at it.
[11:54.340 --> 11:56.940]  I'd love to hear everyone's response to this.
[11:57.600 --> 12:00.620]  First of all, Geoff, Eric, are you good at darts?
[12:00.760 --> 12:00.820]  Yes.
[12:00.820 --> 12:01.800]  Would you consider yourself decent?
[12:02.220 --> 12:03.120]  Yeah, I'm fine.
[12:04.000 --> 12:04.360]  Interesting.
[12:04.820 --> 12:07.960]  Okay, so as people that consider themselves decent to good at darts,
[12:08.440 --> 12:10.860]  how many throws do you think it would take you to hit a bullseye?
[12:11.060 --> 12:14.780]  Uh, I mean, that's not how darts games work.
[12:14.780 --> 12:15.820]  No, not at all.
[12:15.820 --> 12:18.140]  But I could probably get one in ten.
[12:18.920 --> 12:19.500]  One in ten.
[12:19.900 --> 12:22.560]  I think if you gave me ten darts and I was really aiming for it,
[12:22.620 --> 12:23.580]  I bet I could get one in ten.
[12:24.080 --> 12:26.200]  Eric, you gave the exact same answer as me.
[12:26.600 --> 12:27.340]  Did I really?
[12:27.900 --> 12:28.220]  Six.
[12:29.200 --> 12:32.460]  Six? Okay. The difference is Gavin said he was bad at darts.
[12:32.800 --> 12:33.900]  And he was one in ten.
[12:34.280 --> 12:35.740]  I didn't say I was bad, I just said I'm not good.
[12:35.940 --> 12:37.260]  Like, I wouldn't win a game of darts.
[12:37.860 --> 12:39.620]  But you can give me ten darts, I can put it where I want.
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.660]  So you'd say you're average at darts?
[12:45.170 --> 12:46.150]  Because I assumed you were bad.
[12:46.150 --> 12:47.330]  You're right, I could have phrased that better.
[12:47.550 --> 12:48.930]  I just know you're not good.
[12:49.590 --> 12:52.290]  I'd say I'm below average, but I could still hit a bullseye in ten.
[12:52.730 --> 12:54.870]  See, that was shocking, because I think I'm bad at darts.
[12:55.150 --> 12:56.320]  My number is like 250.
[12:57.170 --> 12:59.450]  I think it would take me around 250 darts to hit.
[12:59.450 --> 13:00.030]  Oh yeah, you said 250.
[13:00.110 --> 13:02.370]  I said I could do 250 blindfolded.
[13:02.950 --> 13:03.890]  There's no way.
[13:04.270 --> 13:06.510]  I could eventually get a bullseye
[13:06.510 --> 13:08.750]  with 250 blindfolded darts.
[13:08.990 --> 13:09.530]  No way.
[13:09.870 --> 13:12.010]  Dude, you could hit a bullseye just...
[13:12.010 --> 13:14.470]  If you've got 250 darts to do it in,
[13:14.470 --> 13:16.650]  you could just grab a handful of 20
[13:16.650 --> 13:18.230]  and chuck them all at once
[13:18.230 --> 13:18.990]  and you'd get a bullseye.
[13:18.990 --> 13:21.090]  I think you're greatly overestimating.
[13:22.030 --> 13:22.950]  I don't think I am.
[13:23.290 --> 13:26.450]  I think this is a regulation distance, like 7 feet
[13:26.450 --> 13:28.430]  from the board. Blindfolded.
[13:28.670 --> 13:30.290]  If someone was giving callouts like
[13:30.290 --> 13:33.010]  colder, warmer, I could get a bullseye
[13:33.010 --> 13:33.470]  at 250.
[13:33.550 --> 13:34.210]  Big John, little John.
[13:37.890 --> 13:39.410]  You're saying we're overestimating.
[13:39.590 --> 13:41.870]  250 is an insane amount of darts
[13:41.870 --> 13:44.170]  to throw at the board and not hit a bullseye.
[13:44.170 --> 13:45.690]  No, I agree. That's how bad I am.
[13:45.730 --> 13:48.110]  You physically couldn't fit that many darts on a board, I don't think.
[13:48.650 --> 13:50.650]  Oh, I think I could easily...
[13:50.650 --> 13:51.870]  You want to get a dartboard?
[13:51.950 --> 13:53.550]  We can figure this out. I'll get a dartboard.
[13:54.110 --> 13:56.070]  I bet you would take over 250.
[13:56.170 --> 13:56.770]  You might be right.
[13:58.150 --> 13:58.870]  That's ridiculous.
[14:00.030 --> 14:01.870]  The problem is, though, people will just assume
[14:01.870 --> 14:03.030]  I'm throwing it on purpose.
[14:03.210 --> 14:04.770]  That'd be the issue.
[14:05.230 --> 14:06.290]  That would be my assumption.
[14:07.310 --> 14:08.870]  Yeah. I'd be cheating in some way.
[14:09.510 --> 14:12.170]  I feel like we need to have a...
[14:12.170 --> 14:14.790]  All together, we need to have a dart-off now.
[14:15.430 --> 14:16.190]  I think we just need
[14:16.190 --> 14:18.170]  a separate sideshow called
[14:18.170 --> 14:20.010]  a spin-off called Burger Confidence
[14:20.010 --> 14:21.790]  where it's just
[14:21.790 --> 14:22.930]  the bets.
[14:25.930 --> 14:28.130]  I think if you threw
[14:28.130 --> 14:30.350]  10 darts a day, you wouldn't get it within a week.
[14:31.410 --> 14:31.950]  That's ridiculous!
[14:32.230 --> 14:33.970]  That's 70 darts?!
[14:33.970 --> 14:35.790]  If you threw 10 darts a day,
[14:36.010 --> 14:37.730]  you'd get a dart.
[14:37.810 --> 14:39.030]  You'd get a bullseye a day.
[14:39.870 --> 14:40.670]  There's no... No.
[14:41.670 --> 14:43.090]  I know the... It's not that hard, man!
[14:43.650 --> 14:44.270]  Can you throw...
[14:44.270 --> 14:46.650]  Do you have no aim whatsoever?
[14:47.530 --> 14:49.090]  I have a friend that's good. They went 0 for 20
[14:49.090 --> 14:51.110]  on their first attempt. It's tough.
[14:52.410 --> 14:53.210]  I think
[14:53.210 --> 14:55.170]  most people... If you have aim, you have aim.
[14:55.270 --> 14:56.370]  One time at work,
[14:56.770 --> 14:58.890]  Gavin was on one side of the office, and I was
[14:58.890 --> 15:00.150]  15 feet away,
[15:00.610 --> 15:03.030]  and I, with one ping-pong ball,
[15:03.170 --> 15:05.090]  threw it so hard, and I was trying
[15:05.090 --> 15:07.190]  to hit him in the forehead. I hit him right between
[15:07.190 --> 15:09.070]  the eyes so hard, I split his head open.
[15:09.490 --> 15:11.230]  Like, and that was just one shot. If I could do
[15:11.230 --> 15:13.350]  that with a ping-pong ball, I could definitely do it with a dart,
[15:13.470 --> 15:14.710]  which is designed to be thrown.
[15:14.710 --> 15:16.890]  I think I had, like, a cut or a scab there, and you just
[15:16.890 --> 15:18.690]  made me bleed with a ping-pong ball.
[15:19.690 --> 15:21.290]  Like, I get the throwing mechanic. I don't think
[15:21.290 --> 15:22.430]  those two equate at all.
[15:23.130 --> 15:25.210]  Absolutely. It's the exact same thing. I disagree.
[15:25.450 --> 15:27.170]  There's no difference between throwing a dart and a baseball.
[15:27.830 --> 15:29.110]  Nah, I don't think that's true.
[15:29.990 --> 15:30.230]  Mm-mm.
[15:30.610 --> 15:33.070]  I learned last week that I'm pretty good
[15:33.070 --> 15:35.110]  at throwing axes. I don't think
[15:35.110 --> 15:37.310]  that's a skill. A bar-throwing
[15:37.310 --> 15:39.250]  axe thing? There's a bunch of hipster
[15:39.250 --> 15:40.750]  bars in Austin that would disagree with you.
[15:41.230 --> 15:43.070]  I watched Dan and BK do it after
[15:43.070 --> 15:45.030]  me, and I was... I scored
[15:45.030 --> 15:47.170]  pretty well. Yeah? Maybe I've only
[15:47.170 --> 15:49.170]  seen, because I've never done it, but I've only
[15:49.170 --> 15:51.130]  seen videos of people do it, and they always do really
[15:51.130 --> 15:53.390]  well. So that could be... that could be adjusting
[15:53.390 --> 15:54.710]  my... it just doesn't seem that hard.
[15:55.030 --> 15:56.570]  To be honest, it didn't feel very hard.
[15:57.250 --> 15:58.510]  But it looked hard for Dan.
[15:58.850 --> 16:01.130]  So you think throwing an axe is
[16:01.130 --> 16:02.610]  easier than throwing a dart?
[16:02.610 --> 16:04.290]  Well, the
[16:04.290 --> 16:06.570]  axe landed wherever I
[16:06.570 --> 16:08.550]  looked. I feel like a dart, you need
[16:08.550 --> 16:10.490]  more precision than that. It's a different... yeah,
[16:10.570 --> 16:12.750]  it's a more precise tool. Absolutely.
[16:13.310 --> 16:14.590]  You've got a wide range. You've got
[16:14.590 --> 16:16.650]  a big face on that axe to hit the
[16:16.650 --> 16:18.130]  board. It's stuck in.
[16:18.470 --> 16:20.310]  I think I could throw...
[16:20.310 --> 16:22.610]  I think it's really...
[16:22.610 --> 16:24.450]  like, I have not done axe
[16:24.450 --> 16:26.090]  throwing, but I would imagine it's pretty easy to
[16:26.450 --> 16:28.590]  bonk it off the handle and not
[16:28.590 --> 16:29.630]  get it into the wood at all.
[16:29.630 --> 16:31.690]  To me, I feel like axe throwing is
[16:31.690 --> 16:33.710]  all about form. That's what darts is all
[16:33.710 --> 16:35.630]  about! No, but I feel like there's
[16:35.630 --> 16:37.590]  a mechanism to releasing of the
[16:37.590 --> 16:39.910]  axe that is opposed to... it's more precise
[16:39.910 --> 16:41.670]  with a dart. You've got a smaller range.
[16:41.910 --> 16:43.730]  Dude, throwing is all about
[16:43.730 --> 16:45.470]  form, no matter what you're throwing.
[16:45.630 --> 16:47.690]  Whether it's a football or a soccer
[16:47.690 --> 16:49.650]  ball. No, but I feel like I don't know how
[16:49.650 --> 16:51.790]  to hold a dart. I feel like my finger
[16:51.790 --> 16:53.590]  position might be wrong, like the
[16:53.590 --> 16:55.270]  technique, how much wrist do I...
[16:55.270 --> 16:57.710]  I feel like mechanically, I'm in the
[16:57.710 --> 16:59.790]  woods. Not the woods, I'm in the sea.
[17:00.050 --> 17:01.790]  That's a better analogy. It's a sneakier place.
[17:01.870 --> 17:03.490]  I'm in the ocean when it comes to
[17:03.930 --> 17:05.730]  throwing a dart. I don't know what's going
[17:05.730 --> 17:07.770]  on. But when it's an axe, I feel like
[17:07.770 --> 17:09.710]  you just kind of let go of the thing. And I'm
[17:09.710 --> 17:11.870]  probably completely wrong, but it just doesn't
[17:11.870 --> 17:13.950]  seem that difficult. Yeah, it definitely feels...
[17:13.950 --> 17:15.290]  the axe felt a lot easier to me.
[17:15.650 --> 17:17.730]  Eric, why is this wild? Eric's freaking out.
[17:18.310 --> 17:19.550]  I just don't...
[17:19.550 --> 17:21.590]  I don't get the, like,
[17:21.990 --> 17:23.670]  the pushback on the axe
[17:23.670 --> 17:25.630]  thing and how it doesn't... like, it's
[17:25.630 --> 17:27.690]  one-to-one with darts. Like, none of this makes
[17:27.690 --> 17:29.850]  any sense. But like... but also,
[17:30.670 --> 17:31.930]  I can't throw a frisbee
[17:31.930 --> 17:33.070]  to save my life.
[17:33.390 --> 17:35.110]  I can't. I just can't.
[17:35.630 --> 17:37.710]  I don't know what it is. Is it like one of the things
[17:37.710 --> 17:39.150]  you're embarrassed about? Yes.
[17:39.330 --> 17:41.630]  It is. I'm very embarrassed about the way I throw
[17:41.630 --> 17:43.670]  a frisbee. People invite me
[17:43.670 --> 17:45.610]  to go, like, frisbee golf is like a thing in Austin.
[17:45.730 --> 17:47.490]  People invite me to go and I turn them down.
[17:47.810 --> 17:49.010]  People like Jack? Yeah.
[17:49.590 --> 17:51.750]  Jack has not, but hopefully
[17:51.750 --> 17:53.750]  that keeps up. Because I don't want to go.
[17:55.550 --> 17:55.950]  But,
[17:56.110 --> 17:58.030]  so, I can kind of see what Andrew's
[17:58.030 --> 17:59.870]  saying, but the form of
[17:59.870 --> 18:01.870]  a dart, I agree with Geoff, it's very close
[18:01.870 --> 18:03.890]  to, like, a baseball. It's very
[18:03.890 --> 18:05.970]  close to other things. And especially, like, axe
[18:05.970 --> 18:07.830]  throwing. So, to say that, like,
[18:08.090 --> 18:09.930]  the technique of one is so different
[18:09.930 --> 18:11.670]  from the technique of the other, I don't agree with.
[18:11.790 --> 18:13.610]  And it's really something.
[18:13.810 --> 18:15.750]  And I like that he said, I've seen people
[18:15.750 --> 18:17.870]  do it, and it seems like it's easy.
[18:18.690 --> 18:19.950]  Darts seems like it's
[18:19.950 --> 18:21.390]  easy. It's darts.
[18:21.390 --> 18:23.590]  Darts is so easy, they allow
[18:23.590 --> 18:25.110]  you to do it around alcohol.
[18:25.390 --> 18:27.390]  They encourage you to do it while drunk
[18:27.390 --> 18:28.990]  at every bar in the world.
[18:30.690 --> 18:31.410]  I feel like
[18:31.410 --> 18:33.310]  your dart throw to axe
[18:33.310 --> 18:35.550]  thing would be like saying, I can drive a
[18:35.550 --> 18:37.390]  boat because I know how to drive a car.
[18:38.070 --> 18:39.490]  Like, it's mechanically
[18:39.490 --> 18:41.390]  like, you're driving vehicles, but they're completely
[18:41.390 --> 18:42.910]  different. I think it's a different thing.
[18:43.310 --> 18:44.350]  It's not that different. It's one to one.
[18:45.410 --> 18:47.550]  Driving anything is pretty similar, I think.
[18:47.870 --> 18:49.470]  I don't think that's true. Unless it's got
[18:49.470 --> 18:51.450]  a complicated clutch
[18:51.450 --> 18:52.590]  of some kind.
[18:54.070 --> 18:55.390]  You ever driven a boat?
[18:56.250 --> 18:57.350]  You steer left, it goes left.
[18:57.430 --> 18:58.570]  You steer right, it goes right.
[18:58.930 --> 19:01.250]  You move up, it goes fast.
[19:01.350 --> 19:02.470]  You move back, it goes slow.
[19:04.430 --> 19:05.350]  Well, you get like
[19:05.350 --> 19:07.570]  the handle. You just go up to go forward.
[19:07.770 --> 19:08.350]  It's like Star Trek.
[19:08.670 --> 19:11.470]  No, those are great. I don't think I've ever driven a
[19:11.470 --> 19:13.390]  boat. I have played Hydro Thunder in the
[19:13.390 --> 19:15.350]  Arcade. You got the little stick on that. That's great.
[19:16.010 --> 19:17.490]  And that's pretty
[19:17.490 --> 19:19.470]  similar to playing OutRun or Hang On
[19:19.470 --> 19:20.130]  or Ridge Racer.
[19:22.710 --> 19:23.470]  I'm an automatic
[19:23.470 --> 19:25.410]  guy in those games, though. I don't
[19:25.410 --> 19:27.130]  fuck with the shift. It's too hard.
[19:28.510 --> 19:29.430]  It's way easier
[19:29.430 --> 19:31.530]  to drive a shift in real life than in a
[19:31.530 --> 19:31.930]  video game.
[19:35.570 --> 19:36.970]  When I was a kid, I
[19:37.930 --> 19:39.510]  for some reason, I had a tennis
[19:39.510 --> 19:41.430]  racket. And I got a new tennis racket, so
[19:41.430 --> 19:43.310]  my old one was like a spare. And
[19:43.310 --> 19:45.230]  for some reason, I really wanted to throw it
[19:45.230 --> 19:47.350]  to see what it felt like. The axe throwing
[19:47.350 --> 19:49.230]  reminded me of this. But I
[19:49.230 --> 19:51.130]  lived... I had such a small back
[19:51.130 --> 19:53.130]  garden and my road was so crammed in and
[19:53.130 --> 19:55.210]  small, I felt like I couldn't throw it
[19:55.210 --> 19:56.990]  as hard as I could without
[19:56.990 --> 19:59.230]  hitting something. So I walked all the way to
[19:59.230 --> 20:01.250]  this field to throw
[20:01.250 --> 20:03.250]  my tennis racket to see what it felt like.
[20:05.610 --> 20:06.650]  How did it feel?
[20:07.230 --> 20:08.750]  Did you feel good? Really satisfying.
[20:09.170 --> 20:11.150]  It's really satisfying to throw something that's
[20:11.150 --> 20:12.930]  top heavy because it goes like...
[20:12.930 --> 20:15.050]  But I remember just being like, sneaking
[20:15.050 --> 20:15.910]  around and just being like,
[20:16.290 --> 20:18.630]  I want to go somewhere and throw this.
[20:20.970 --> 20:22.990]  Now, if you were sneakier, would you have gone more
[20:22.990 --> 20:24.930]  often? Or where does your sneak skill
[20:24.930 --> 20:26.890]  align with your tennis throwing hobby?
[20:26.890 --> 20:28.670]  If I was sneakier, I probably would have gone under the water.
[20:29.230 --> 20:30.490]  Really? With the fish.
[20:30.790 --> 20:32.790]  Now, that wouldn't be fun to throw under the water, though.
[20:33.050 --> 20:34.450]  That'd be terrible. Agreed.
[20:34.690 --> 20:36.690]  That's a good point. Resistant?
[20:38.270 --> 20:38.670]  Eric
[20:38.670 --> 20:40.990]  said something earlier that
[20:40.990 --> 20:42.870]  triggered an idea I was
[20:42.870 --> 20:44.270]  debating on having with y'all.
[20:44.890 --> 20:46.510]  Are we doing two episodes today?
[20:47.170 --> 20:48.030]  I assume so.
[20:48.410 --> 20:51.190]  I thought so. I assumed so as well.
[20:52.670 --> 20:54.810]  I wasn't sure if I'd talk about this episode or not.
[20:55.370 --> 20:56.950]  But I was thinking
[20:56.950 --> 20:58.230]  about mayonnaise, right?
[20:59.010 --> 21:00.910]  And how much I fucking hate mayonnaise.
[21:01.790 --> 21:02.270]  Mayonnaise?
[21:03.290 --> 21:04.830]  Like, I just can't stand mayonnaise, right?
[21:04.930 --> 21:06.630]  It's white. I don't like white stuff.
[21:06.770 --> 21:08.990]  It's probably the grossest of
[21:08.990 --> 21:10.750]  all white things to me, maybe.
[21:11.270 --> 21:11.890]  Is mayo.
[21:12.770 --> 21:14.070]  Mayo or maybe
[21:14.730 --> 21:17.030]  cream cheese. Actually, cream cheese
[21:17.030 --> 21:18.930]  because if I smell mayonnaise, I want to throw up.
[21:19.190 --> 21:20.930]  But if I look at cream cheese, I want to throw up.
[21:23.110 --> 21:24.470]  And I was wondering,
[21:24.690 --> 21:27.190]  could I train myself
[21:27.690 --> 21:28.910]  to like mayonnaise
[21:28.910 --> 21:30.070]  if I had to?
[21:30.470 --> 21:31.150]  If somebody said,
[21:31.290 --> 21:35.230]  I need you to like mayonnaise.
[21:35.490 --> 21:36.890]  Here's a million dollars in a year.
[21:36.890 --> 21:39.150]  Could I get there? And I feel like I probably could, right?
[21:39.210 --> 21:41.510]  Like, I feel like there are probably things that we all hate.
[21:41.650 --> 21:43.250]  That we, if we wanted to like
[21:43.250 --> 21:44.430]  get over this hurdle,
[21:44.630 --> 21:46.290]  we could probably learn to like.
[21:46.530 --> 21:49.290]  And I wonder if we agreed to do it,
[21:49.330 --> 21:51.070]  we could get Eric good at frisbee.
[21:51.490 --> 21:52.810]  Like, we could start training
[21:52.810 --> 21:55.110]  and practicing and turn Eric's
[21:55.110 --> 21:57.690]  frisbee failure into a frisbee success.
[21:58.190 --> 21:58.670]  Here's...
[21:58.670 --> 21:59.690]  Here's the thing.
[22:01.650 --> 22:02.610]  Geoff, maybe
[22:02.610 --> 22:04.950]  you could. I don't know
[22:04.950 --> 22:06.870]  what Gavin and Andrew are providing
[22:06.870 --> 22:07.770]  in this situation.
[22:08.790 --> 22:09.170]  What do you mean?
[22:11.010 --> 22:12.430]  To improve your form?
[22:12.690 --> 22:15.050]  And frisbee throwing? Yeah, like what could we bring to the table?
[22:15.170 --> 22:16.790]  Yeah, Mr. 300 darts
[22:16.790 --> 22:18.910]  over here isn't going to be helpful to you. I'm terrible.
[22:19.230 --> 22:20.410]  I'm a bad frisbee thrower too.
[22:21.230 --> 22:22.810]  See? See? So what?
[22:22.870 --> 22:25.170]  So Geoff, it would just be me and you throwing a frisbee
[22:25.170 --> 22:27.210]  and then Gavin is also...
[22:27.210 --> 22:27.990]  Yeah, and then Gavin...
[22:27.990 --> 22:30.430]  So I stand by my statement.
[22:30.870 --> 22:32.550]  That sounds like two friends hanging out on the weekend.
[22:32.550 --> 22:33.990]  It sounds lovely. Thanks for the invite.
[22:35.630 --> 22:36.190]  I've seen
[22:37.570 --> 22:38.610]  Gavin throw a frisbee
[22:38.610 --> 22:39.990]  though. We've done frisbees together.
[22:40.230 --> 22:42.250]  We got one stuck in a tree, didn't we?
[22:42.370 --> 22:44.510]  Yeah, we used to live over off...
[22:44.510 --> 22:46.490]  back when we lived down at the rental
[22:46.490 --> 22:46.830]  house.
[22:48.110 --> 22:50.290]  With Jordan Swears, we threw frisbees a couple times.
[22:50.430 --> 22:52.530]  That's true. I think I have a picture of him
[22:52.530 --> 22:53.730]  climbing a tree to get it down.
[22:55.870 --> 22:56.670]  Frisbees are satisfying
[22:56.670 --> 22:58.470]  to throw. What happens when you throw a frisbee, Eric?
[22:58.710 --> 22:59.950]  It goes way off
[22:59.950 --> 23:01.030]  to the side.
[23:01.890 --> 23:03.730]  I try to make it go straight. I do the thing.
[23:03.870 --> 23:05.590]  I look at it. I point my toe.
[23:07.290 --> 23:07.650]  It's...go...release
[23:07.650 --> 23:09.770]  right where I need it to be. And then it just
[23:09.770 --> 23:10.990]  keeps going off to the right.
[23:11.470 --> 23:13.050]  Are you putting your whole body into it?
[23:13.710 --> 23:15.830]  Yeah. Oh, I'm doing everything. There's just something
[23:15.830 --> 23:17.950]  about the mechanic of it where I can't get...
[23:18.730 --> 23:19.410]  I don't know.
[23:19.530 --> 23:21.790]  I'm fine with every other sport. I can throw football, throw baseball.
[23:21.810 --> 23:23.890]  I'm fine with sports, golf, whatever.
[23:24.230 --> 23:25.950]  But for some reason, I throw
[23:25.950 --> 23:27.870]  a frisbee and it just doesn't go anywhere where I
[23:27.870 --> 23:29.790]  need it to go. And the worst
[23:30.870 --> 23:31.870]  part...the worst part
[23:31.870 --> 23:33.850]  about throwing a frisbee wrong is you gotta go
[23:33.850 --> 23:34.570]  get it.
[23:35.770 --> 23:37.870]  And it's a long...and boy
[23:37.870 --> 23:40.050]  it's a long walk to wherever
[23:40.050 --> 23:41.930]  it ended up. Kevin, what did you
[23:41.930 --> 23:43.950]  expect him to say? That was a
[23:43.950 --> 23:45.330]  ridiculous question by you.
[23:45.750 --> 23:48.130]  No! What happens
[23:48.130 --> 23:50.010]  when you throw it? He misses.
[23:50.510 --> 23:51.930]  That's the whole point. It doesn't turn
[23:51.930 --> 23:53.590]  into a fucking weasel
[23:53.590 --> 23:55.690]  or an owl. It could've gone straight into the ground. It could've
[23:55.690 --> 23:57.850]  not gone very far. It doesn't matter.
[23:58.090 --> 23:59.650]  No, I agree with Gavin here.
[23:59.790 --> 24:01.690]  I think the answer dictates how you
[24:01.690 --> 24:03.670]  fix the problem. Like, if he's like, every time
[24:03.670 --> 24:05.310]  I throw it, it goes straight in the fucking air.
[24:05.430 --> 24:07.250]  Like, straight up. You're like, oh, okay.
[24:07.770 --> 24:09.790]  Listen, I'm not gonna argue with you about
[24:09.790 --> 24:11.590]  this, Geoff. You're the fucking Tiger Woods of
[24:11.590 --> 24:13.670]  disc golf, by how it sounds. But Gavin, on
[24:13.670 --> 24:15.690]  the other hand, I have no confidence
[24:15.690 --> 24:17.370]  in his ability to throw a frisbee.
[24:17.670 --> 24:19.250]  I don't know what he's trying to diagnose.
[24:19.870 --> 24:21.550]  Give me one of those aerobics things. Give me one of those rings.
[24:21.690 --> 24:23.650]  I will send that thing over
[24:23.650 --> 24:25.530]  everything that we're looking at. Those
[24:25.530 --> 24:27.810]  things go so far. What does that
[24:27.810 --> 24:29.710]  prove? What are you proving by
[24:29.710 --> 24:31.670]  doing that? What are you saying? That I'm shit
[24:31.670 --> 24:33.830]  at frisbee? Yeah, if we're talking about
[24:33.830 --> 24:35.690]  accuracy, you're just like, I can throw a
[24:35.690 --> 24:37.590]  thing far. That's great, but that's not
[24:37.590 --> 24:39.430]  how you play frisbee.
[24:39.970 --> 24:41.310]  You say hit that tree, I'll get it in the tree.
[24:41.850 --> 24:43.630]  What if it was, like, a small Christmas
[24:43.630 --> 24:45.730]  tree? I'll give it a damn
[24:45.730 --> 24:47.630]  good go. I'll get close. Here's the thing
[24:47.630 --> 24:49.110]  with Eric, though. And his
[24:49.570 --> 24:51.270]  problem is one we can fix.
[24:51.270 --> 24:53.310]  Eric, I've got
[24:53.310 --> 24:55.670]  a high-speed camera. We can do slow-mo
[24:55.670 --> 24:56.830]  sports analysis
[24:56.830 --> 24:58.810]  on your release point.
[24:59.610 --> 25:01.430]  Eric, it is
[25:01.430 --> 25:02.590]  all in the wrist.
[25:03.330 --> 25:05.010]  The frisbee, and by the way, I've never played
[25:05.010 --> 25:07.190]  disc golf in my life. I don't even think I've ever thrown one.
[25:07.450 --> 25:08.870]  But I've thrown a fucking frisbee.
[25:09.330 --> 25:11.470]  It's 100% in the
[25:12.250 --> 25:13.290]  wrist motion.
[25:13.690 --> 25:15.030]  We can fix that. Gavin,
[25:15.470 --> 25:17.410]  I think that your solution
[25:17.410 --> 25:19.430]  is great and is
[25:19.970 --> 25:21.490]  half of a solution.
[25:21.870 --> 25:23.530]  Because you're going to film me
[25:23.530 --> 25:25.570]  in slow motion throwing a
[25:25.570 --> 25:27.710]  frisbee, and then we're going to look at it
[25:27.710 --> 25:29.550]  and everyone's just going to
[25:29.550 --> 25:31.570]  go, just throw it, you know,
[25:31.710 --> 25:33.690]  look, right there, throw it straighter.
[25:34.050 --> 25:35.110]  And nothing's going to happen.
[25:35.410 --> 25:37.570]  No one here can break down
[25:37.570 --> 25:39.730]  film like a sports analyst.
[25:41.130 --> 25:41.670]  I'm just
[25:41.670 --> 25:43.570]  going to show, you're going to film
[25:43.570 --> 25:45.550]  it, and then we're going to look at it in slow
[25:45.550 --> 25:47.510]  motion, and then Geoff's going to go,
[25:47.510 --> 25:49.170]  oh, yeah, just,
[25:49.570 --> 25:51.190]  you know, throw it, like,
[25:51.410 --> 25:52.150]  you know, point.
[25:53.310 --> 25:55.510]  It's just going to be useful to know
[25:55.510 --> 25:57.330]  how much later or earlier
[25:57.330 --> 25:58.070]  to let go.
[25:59.070 --> 26:01.510]  I would look at it and say, that looks pretty good to me.
[26:01.730 --> 26:02.270]  Yeah, exactly.
[26:03.050 --> 26:05.470]  You don't think we'll be like,
[26:05.570 --> 26:07.370]  what was that show Kobe Bryant did on
[26:07.370 --> 26:09.370]  ESPN Details, where he would break down
[26:09.370 --> 26:11.250]  film of how NBA players
[26:11.250 --> 26:12.550]  could improve their game?
[26:12.890 --> 26:14.570]  You don't think we could do that for you, Eric?
[26:14.570 --> 26:14.930]  No.
[26:16.950 --> 26:17.390]  No.
[26:17.690 --> 26:20.470]  Are you asking if you're Kobe Bryant in this
[26:20.470 --> 26:21.230]  situation, Geoff?
[26:22.310 --> 26:23.570]  Well, yeah, I guess so.
[26:23.830 --> 26:25.090]  I think
[26:26.170 --> 26:28.170]  we could break down the film and help you.
[26:28.250 --> 26:29.690]  I don't think it's that complicated.
[26:30.030 --> 26:32.290]  I was on your side at first. Upon thinking
[26:32.290 --> 26:34.170]  about this further, let's calm down for a minute.
[26:34.410 --> 26:36.190]  You're the one that's supposed to be throwing an
[26:36.190 --> 26:37.830]  80 mile per hour fastball.
[26:38.070 --> 26:40.390]  Why don't we figure out how to improve your form
[26:40.390 --> 26:42.350]  first? Why are we going to Eric?
[26:42.350 --> 26:43.470]  No, no, listen.
[26:43.890 --> 26:45.970]  I'm not fighting.
[26:46.330 --> 26:48.390]  I don't need you to film.
[26:48.630 --> 26:50.270]  I know what I'm doing and how to do it right.
[26:50.390 --> 26:51.610]  I'm fighting father time.
[26:52.050 --> 26:54.370]  I'm fighting age. Me and LeBron, right?
[26:54.730 --> 26:56.150]  It's just that every day,
[26:56.290 --> 26:58.270]  the Grim Reaper's coming a little bit closer for our
[26:58.270 --> 26:59.670]  abilities. As do I.
[27:00.430 --> 27:02.090]  LeBron's out right now with a groin injury.
[27:02.530 --> 27:04.430]  My groin hasn't been fine for six months.
[27:05.810 --> 27:07.790]  Can you imagine if LeBron
[27:07.790 --> 27:10.270]  had a fucking jock itch scenario
[27:10.270 --> 27:11.890]  like that was his lower body?
[27:12.490 --> 27:14.170]  It's always a hamstring. You two are not
[27:14.170 --> 27:16.470]  dealing with similar... I guess he had the ankles. That's fair.
[27:16.570 --> 27:18.330]  Dude, if LeBron had my
[27:18.330 --> 27:20.070]  jock itch, he would miss the entire
[27:20.070 --> 27:20.970]  fucking season.
[27:21.490 --> 27:23.770]  Oh, he would be so uncomfortable, he'd play really well.
[27:24.210 --> 27:26.370]  Yeah, nobody would want to guard someone
[27:26.370 --> 27:28.250]  with a jock itch all the way down
[27:28.250 --> 27:29.610]  the leg. You're not getting in there.
[27:31.250 --> 27:32.410]  Nick said DNP
[27:32.410 --> 27:33.390]  crotch rot. That's great.
[27:35.390 --> 27:36.250]  Okay, so we're
[27:36.250 --> 27:38.110]  going to pass on trying to fix my frisbee
[27:38.110 --> 27:40.250]  throw then, right? We don't have to worry about that?
[27:40.410 --> 27:41.930]  I don't have to worry about trying to fix
[27:41.930 --> 27:43.990]  my frisbee throw? If Eric and I
[27:43.990 --> 27:46.070]  tried to play frisbee together, it would be like
[27:46.070 --> 27:48.290]  we're playing with ghosts. It would be so far
[27:48.290 --> 27:49.750]  left and right on both sides.
[27:50.110 --> 27:52.190]  Nobody would assume we were in the same bin. Here's what we do.
[27:52.270 --> 27:53.810]  It doesn't have to be.
[27:54.290 --> 27:55.650]  I'll put on a bit of a wider lens,
[27:56.070 --> 27:58.050]  Geoff and Eric side by side in the same
[27:58.050 --> 27:59.670]  shot, and we'll compare.
[28:00.490 --> 28:02.130]  And we'll take notes, we'll try and apply.
[28:02.470 --> 28:03.870]  Geoff knows exactly what he did.
[28:03.910 --> 28:05.770]  He can maybe move some of that information
[28:05.770 --> 28:07.570]  accurately to you. And with the visuals,
[28:08.050 --> 28:09.150]  I think you can throw a good frisbee.
[28:09.370 --> 28:11.970]  Here's what's going to be really funny. I'm talking a big frisbee
[28:11.970 --> 28:13.810]  game like I know what the fuck I'm talking
[28:13.810 --> 28:14.670]  about. 100%.
[28:15.710 --> 28:17.570]  Much like I did with a baseball game.
[28:17.970 --> 28:19.830]  That one worked out for me. I have
[28:19.830 --> 28:21.870]  no idea if this frisbee thing...
[28:21.870 --> 28:23.930]  I don't have the confidence for frisbees
[28:23.930 --> 28:25.550]  that I had for hitting a baseball. So
[28:25.550 --> 28:27.670]  there's a very good chance we'll film this and
[28:27.670 --> 28:29.690]  Eric will instantly be better than me.
[28:30.210 --> 28:31.770]  I would just love to find out. Burger confidence, episode
[28:31.770 --> 28:32.810]  one. Alright.
[28:37.670 --> 28:38.550]  This show
[28:38.550 --> 28:40.110]  is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[28:40.510 --> 28:42.290]  There are so many times in life,
[28:42.450 --> 28:44.110]  whether it's dealing with a personal issue,
[28:44.210 --> 28:46.430]  or stuff at work, where it would be so much easier
[28:46.430 --> 28:48.110]  if there was just a user manual for it.
[28:48.470 --> 28:50.350]  Unfortunately, that's not really a real thing.
[28:50.670 --> 28:52.510]  However, BetterHelp online therapy
[28:52.510 --> 28:54.170]  is basically the next best thing.
[28:54.790 --> 28:56.330]  Unfortunately, life doesn't come with a
[28:56.330 --> 28:58.190]  user manual. So when it's not working
[28:58.190 --> 29:00.090]  for you, it's normal to feel stuck.
[29:00.450 --> 29:02.250]  Navigating any of life's challenges can
[29:02.250 --> 29:04.210]  make you feel unsure. Whether it's a career
[29:04.210 --> 29:06.430]  change, a new relationship, or becoming a parent.

[29:08.270 --> 29:10.150]  you figure out the cause of challenging emotions
[29:10.150 --> 29:12.150]  and learn productive coping skills.
[29:12.470 --> 29:14.330]  Which makes therapy the closest thing

[29:24.430 --> 29:26.210]  online. I've talked about
[29:26.210 --> 29:28.050]  how much therapy has helped me in my past.
[29:28.190 --> 29:29.530]  It's an amazing thing.
[29:30.430 --> 29:32.130]  It has helped me in so many ways.
[29:32.130 --> 29:33.830]  It's something that I regularly
[29:33.830 --> 29:36.070]  use in my personal life. The lessons
[29:36.070 --> 29:38.470]  and things I've gained from those experiences.
[29:38.690 --> 29:40.130]  So I'd highly recommend it to anyone.

[30:16.150 --> 30:17.970]  talk about notifications for a second?

[33:24.810 --> 33:26.230]  Who do you think can throw a frisbee
[33:26.230 --> 33:28.030]  the farthest? Accurately?
[33:28.410 --> 33:30.110]  Or just the farthest?
[33:30.150 --> 33:32.330]  Like if the five
[33:32.330 --> 33:34.250]  of us got together in a field, let's say
[33:34.250 --> 33:36.110]  sometime next week, and we all had
[33:36.110 --> 33:38.130]  our own color coded frisbees
[33:38.650 --> 33:40.410]  that were identical in every way
[33:40.410 --> 33:42.290]  other than they were just different colors for identification
[33:42.290 --> 33:44.070]  and we tried to see who could do
[33:44.070 --> 33:45.850]  an Olympic style shot put
[33:45.850 --> 33:47.910]  frisbee throw to see who could throw it.
[33:47.910 --> 33:49.250]  I bet Nick is a dark horse.
[33:50.990 --> 33:51.990]  Nick is a good one.
[33:51.990 --> 33:53.030]  I wasn't even considering Nick.
[33:53.190 --> 33:55.830]  Nick's an athletic guy.
[33:56.470 --> 33:58.070]  Nick is the only guy where if we
[33:58.070 --> 34:00.150]  shot me in slow motion, I think he could look at
[34:00.150 --> 34:02.090]  the footage
[34:02.790 --> 34:04.350]  and really break down
[34:04.350 --> 34:05.530]  well there's your problem,
[34:05.850 --> 34:07.550]  I think he could do that. But
[34:08.070 --> 34:09.770]  that is just based on
[34:09.770 --> 34:12.110]  knowing the rest of you and saying
[34:12.110 --> 34:13.570]  that he would just know
[34:14.110 --> 34:16.210]  better than everyone else. It's a pretty low bar.
[34:16.730 --> 34:18.110]  I just feel like we gotta
[34:18.110 --> 34:20.090]  find out. Cause you never know, one time
[34:20.090 --> 34:21.470]  Gavin and I had a spitting contest
[34:22.290 --> 34:23.050]  and... What?
[34:24.230 --> 34:25.550]  Are we talking distance?
[34:26.170 --> 34:28.090]  Yeah, distance. How far did I spit, Gav?
[34:28.150 --> 34:29.770]  I had no idea that I had that in me.
[34:29.870 --> 34:30.890]  I must have spit 25 feet.
[34:34.030 --> 34:36.270]  There's no way. You might be surprised.
[34:37.330 --> 34:38.270]  Gavin... It's on
[34:38.270 --> 34:40.070]  video, dude. You can go watch it.
[34:40.070 --> 34:42.030]  It may have had some
[34:42.030 --> 34:43.410]  windage behind it.
[34:43.550 --> 34:46.050]  Did you do it in a tornado? What is the
[34:46.050 --> 34:47.910]  scenario in which... I did it during a tropical
[34:47.910 --> 34:49.270]  storm. No!
[34:50.650 --> 34:51.630]  Anyway, I just
[34:51.630 --> 34:53.910]  think it would be interesting and I think that... I do
[34:53.910 --> 34:55.670]  agree, I think that Nick is the
[34:55.670 --> 34:58.110]  early favorite. I was also thinking like
[34:58.670 --> 35:00.110]  you know, now that we're talking about
[35:00.110 --> 35:01.370]  Nick, what do you think
[35:02.510 --> 35:04.110]  sport Nick is the best at?
[35:04.290 --> 35:05.910]  Because I'm gonna... Basketball?
[35:06.250 --> 35:07.530]  Yeah. Okay.
[35:08.010 --> 35:09.610]  I bet Nick is really good
[35:09.610 --> 35:11.550]  at cornhole. He seems like he would be
[35:11.550 --> 35:13.530]  great at cornhole. Yeah, I could see that too.
[35:13.890 --> 35:15.470]  What sport? What? Nick responded
[35:15.470 --> 35:17.390]  with, oh dude, I rule a cornhole.
[35:17.590 --> 35:18.630]  Yeah, he absolutely would.
[35:19.970 --> 35:21.630]  Nick has cornhole written all
[35:21.630 --> 35:23.650]  over him. He's a dad, he should
[35:23.650 --> 35:25.510]  be pretty good at it, just by default, I
[35:25.510 --> 35:27.550]  would think. He looks like a guy who would be
[35:27.550 --> 35:29.390]  holding a bud light in one hand and throwing the
[35:29.390 --> 35:31.490]  cornhole bean bag in like the other and like he'd be
[35:31.490 --> 35:32.790]  nailing it, right? Yeah.
[35:33.670 --> 35:35.530]  We should have a non-athletic
[35:35.530 --> 35:37.430]  sports olympics for f*** face where we all
[35:37.430 --> 35:39.490]  compete against each other with
[35:39.490 --> 35:41.510]  shit like frisbees and cornhole. We should probably
[35:41.510 --> 35:43.350]  bring Jack into the fold as well because he's
[35:43.350 --> 35:44.990]  really good at all that bar shit.
[35:45.530 --> 35:47.430]  Cornhole. He's probably good at like swing the
[35:47.430 --> 35:49.630]  hook onto the hook thing. Why would we want to bring in someone good?
[35:49.710 --> 35:51.530]  I don't know, just to have like a good baseline. He
[35:51.530 --> 35:53.450]  f***ing brags about how good
[35:53.450 --> 35:55.450]  he is at swinging the hook
[35:55.450 --> 35:57.350]  onto the hook thing. He f***ing
[35:57.350 --> 35:59.470]  don't get him started on that. What's the name of
[35:59.470 --> 36:00.670]  swing the hook onto the hook thing?
[36:01.290 --> 36:02.710]  I don't know. You know what we're talking about?
[36:02.710 --> 36:04.890]  Yeah, it's that bar game. It's the
[36:05.550 --> 36:06.890]  swing the hook onto the
[36:06.890 --> 36:08.190]  hook thing. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
[36:09.410 --> 36:10.610]  Like a ring and you gotta
[36:10.610 --> 36:12.830]  spin it and land it on a hook. Get it caught.
[36:13.250 --> 36:15.170]  I think it's just called ring on a hook, isn't it?
[36:15.370 --> 36:16.730]  Hooks! Ring toss
[36:16.730 --> 36:18.310]  and shot. That's it. It just looks like it says
[36:18.310 --> 36:19.930]  hook and ring game.
[36:20.710 --> 36:22.770]  I think, you know, we've been
[36:22.770 --> 36:24.550]  trying to beef up the
[36:25.130 --> 36:26.850]  shoulder content, the non-regulation
[36:26.850 --> 36:28.830]  content. I think we've got something here
[36:29.510 --> 36:30.910]  with this whole idea
[36:30.910 --> 36:32.670]  of sports, of improving
[36:32.670 --> 36:34.910]  ourselves, whether it be getting
[36:34.910 --> 36:36.250]  Eric better at
[36:36.930 --> 36:38.810]  frisbee or me eating mayonnaise
[36:38.810 --> 36:40.830]  although I'd really rather not go down
[36:40.830 --> 36:42.750]  that road or competing against each other
[36:42.750 --> 36:44.530]  in non-athletic sports. What is this?
[36:45.050 --> 36:46.750]  Ga-hoo. Don't use a
[36:46.750 --> 36:48.770]  magnetic dart board. Yeah, why would you use magnetic
[36:48.770 --> 36:50.550]  darts? Put holes in your wall, Andrew. Come on.
[36:51.870 --> 36:52.830]  That's motivation
[36:52.830 --> 36:54.290]  not to throw like s***.
[36:54.750 --> 36:56.710]  That's okay. That's the cheapest one.
[36:56.770 --> 36:57.510]  That's why I sent it.
[36:57.510 --> 36:59.030]  Mm. Mm-mm.
[37:00.070 --> 37:00.590]  What about this one?
[37:01.450 --> 37:03.570]  What about a soft tip? Are we okay with a soft tip
[37:03.570 --> 37:05.690]  dart? No, get a regular dart board.
[37:06.310 --> 37:07.410]  Okay. Jesus Christ.
[37:08.430 --> 37:08.950]  Calm down.
[37:09.590 --> 37:10.630]  Regular dart board.
[37:11.630 --> 37:13.110]  I'm trying to find a regular dart board.
[37:13.590 --> 37:15.170]  They're tough to find. Well...
[37:15.170 --> 37:15.890]  Regulation dart board?
[37:18.850 --> 37:19.670]  Oh, man.
[37:19.750 --> 37:21.490]  Now we gotta sell regulation sports equipment.
[37:21.850 --> 37:22.210]  Oh, God.
[37:22.930 --> 37:25.150]  Is this a... no. Hmm.
[37:25.150 --> 37:26.870]  Hey, I'd be interested in all of us playing darts,
[37:27.030 --> 37:28.950]  all of us throwing frisbees, and all of us throwing axes.
[37:29.470 --> 37:29.830]  Yeah.
[37:30.870 --> 37:32.530]  This just sounds like going to a bar.
[37:32.870 --> 37:34.630]  I'd like to play cornhole against Nick.
[37:36.150 --> 37:37.210]  Face bar crawl.
[37:37.790 --> 37:39.290]  Oh, yeah, but some of us don't drink.
[37:39.610 --> 37:40.470]  What about...
[37:40.470 --> 37:42.770]  We have to drink alcohol. It's about the game.
[37:42.830 --> 37:44.910]  What about horseshoes?
[37:45.010 --> 37:47.090]  Do you guys play horseshoes? I haven't thought about horseshoes
[37:47.090 --> 37:49.330]  since I was a kid. I hate horseshoes.
[37:49.630 --> 37:50.470]  I don't think I've done that one.
[37:50.830 --> 37:51.830]  I don't like cornhole either.
[37:53.370 --> 37:54.170]  Oh, that's...
[37:54.170 --> 37:55.850]  Why? Why don't you like cornhole?
[37:57.110 --> 37:57.510]  Dogshit.
[37:58.250 --> 37:59.610]  What's the problem with it?
[38:00.270 --> 38:01.450]  It's just not satisfying.
[38:01.850 --> 38:03.990]  Not satisfying? Too many points?
[38:04.290 --> 38:06.150]  Is it too many points scoring cornhole for you?
[38:06.530 --> 38:08.190]  No, I just don't find it very...
[38:08.190 --> 38:08.610]  What about that one?
[38:08.950 --> 38:10.370]  Not very fulfilling. Hmm.
[38:10.910 --> 38:13.810]  Yeah, isn't it fun to throw a beanbag, though?
[38:13.850 --> 38:15.530]  They're, like, heavy, and they're floopy.
[38:16.010 --> 38:17.370]  Yeah, I would say they are.
[38:17.630 --> 38:19.690]  I don't think underarm games are any good.
[38:21.630 --> 38:21.990]  Oh...
[38:21.990 --> 38:23.330]  Hmm. So you don't like bowling?
[38:23.790 --> 38:24.730]  Cricket? You're against cricket?
[38:24.730 --> 38:26.290]  I actually don't like bowling.
[38:26.510 --> 38:28.270]  Geoff, you don't like bowling.
[38:28.510 --> 38:29.170]  No, I'm right there with them.
[38:30.990 --> 38:32.210]  I'll agree with him on that one.
[38:33.110 --> 38:33.970]  Did you say cricket?
[38:34.390 --> 38:36.130]  Yeah. It's an underhand throw.
[38:36.770 --> 38:37.450]  No, it isn't.
[38:38.130 --> 38:38.490]  Yeah, it is.
[38:38.750 --> 38:40.710]  You overhand it straight into the ground.
[38:41.230 --> 38:42.930]  No, they do the hand loop, and then they release.
[38:43.290 --> 38:44.130]  What?
[38:45.090 --> 38:45.910]  Are you thinking of softball?
[38:46.370 --> 38:49.270]  No, I'm thinking of cricket. They spin the hand,
[38:49.350 --> 38:50.590]  and then it bounces off the ground.
[38:50.910 --> 38:52.390]  Yeah, but they go over their head.
[38:52.730 --> 38:54.750]  Yeah, but they release at the bottom.
[38:56.070 --> 38:56.870]  Do they?
[38:57.350 --> 38:59.430]  Yeah, and it goes down into the ground,
[38:59.470 --> 39:00.430]  and then up into the bat.
[39:00.850 --> 39:01.470]  Are you serious?
[39:03.910 --> 39:04.870]  Cricket throw.
[39:05.450 --> 39:06.090]  Cricket ball.
[39:06.730 --> 39:09.470]  Dude, I think fast-pitch softball
[39:09.470 --> 39:11.490]  might be the scariest thing in the world.
[39:11.490 --> 39:12.890]  That's so overhand.
[39:14.510 --> 39:16.010]  You're trying to murder them.
[39:16.290 --> 39:17.550]  No, I'm wrong. I'm wrong.
[39:17.830 --> 39:18.230]  You're right.
[39:18.870 --> 39:22.030]  Has anybody ever invented underhand cricket?
[39:23.350 --> 39:23.710]  Wow.
[39:24.210 --> 39:25.430]  Well, you would underhand if you were maybe
[39:25.430 --> 39:26.370]  right by the wicket.
[39:27.430 --> 39:30.130]  Are you saying a softball version of cricket?
[39:30.370 --> 39:32.250]  Yeah, like fast-pitch cricket.
[39:32.710 --> 39:33.770]  What's interesting about cricket,
[39:33.910 --> 39:36.090]  and that angle doesn't show,
[39:36.170 --> 39:37.750]  is how far away they are from each other.
[39:37.890 --> 39:39.410]  That's actually quite a long throw.
[39:39.910 --> 39:41.470]  That's crazy. I really thought it was that long.
[39:41.470 --> 39:43.770]  Alright, I want to see what the distance...
[39:45.450 --> 39:46.170]  Cricket's pitch...
[39:46.170 --> 39:47.810]  I hope it's 60 feet, 6 inches.
[39:50.590 --> 39:51.310]  It is...
[39:51.310 --> 39:52.970]  Is a cricket pitch 66 feet?
[39:53.030 --> 39:55.350]  The cricket pitch length is 22 yards,
[39:55.470 --> 39:57.350]  approximately 66 feet in length.
[39:58.410 --> 39:59.630]  So it's only just a little bit
[39:59.630 --> 40:01.210]  further than a...
[40:01.210 --> 40:01.550]  Baseball.
[40:02.810 --> 40:04.970]  We compare it to softball, though, aren't we, with an underhand?
[40:05.290 --> 40:07.230]  Yeah, but cricket's overhand.
[40:08.030 --> 40:09.350]  Baseball isn't underhand!
[40:09.710 --> 40:11.150]  Yeah, baseball's overhand. It's 60 feet.
[40:11.950 --> 40:14.290]  Yeah, Gavin, I don't know if you've seen this cricket gif.
[40:14.570 --> 40:15.450]  So he's throwing overhand,
[40:15.510 --> 40:16.170]  and so is baseball.
[40:16.790 --> 40:18.250]  I understand, but what's the...
[40:18.250 --> 40:20.430]  What is the comparison you're trying to make?
[40:20.690 --> 40:22.790]  The distance is about the same. That's all we're saying.
[40:23.410 --> 40:24.810]  Oh. I mean, it's pretty far.
[40:25.330 --> 40:26.210]  It's pretty far!
[40:26.430 --> 40:29.630]  You're so defensive, we're not sure over what.
[40:29.950 --> 40:30.930]  I'm saying, like,
[40:31.030 --> 40:33.010]  it would be very difficult to underhand that
[40:33.010 --> 40:34.750]  with any power. It would be very difficult.
[40:34.750 --> 40:36.470]  How do you feel about sidehand?
[40:37.510 --> 40:38.710]  What are we talking about today?
[40:39.110 --> 40:40.550]  What is this episode?
[40:40.810 --> 40:42.850]  I was talking about throws.
[40:43.370 --> 40:44.390]  I always like in football,
[40:44.530 --> 40:46.530]  he throws out of the side, the side throw.
[40:47.190 --> 40:48.130]  The sidearm throw?
[40:48.510 --> 40:50.890]  The sidearm throw is the best pitch in baseball.
[40:51.010 --> 40:51.510]  It's so cool.
[40:51.970 --> 40:54.530]  I mainly wanted to make a bet with you involving darts,
[40:54.590 --> 40:56.730]  but it sounds like we got a whole other thing happening
[40:56.730 --> 40:58.850]  with these games. Did you ever say what you
[40:58.850 --> 40:59.590]  Oh, what happened to him?
[41:00.750 --> 41:03.150]  Oh. What do you mean? He's throwing a baseball really hard.
[41:03.730 --> 41:05.570]  It's a sidearm pitch.
[41:06.290 --> 41:07.790]  It's a sidearm throw.
[41:08.210 --> 41:09.030]  Of a Yankee?
[41:09.490 --> 41:10.870]  Throwing sideways?
[41:11.110 --> 41:13.550]  I need to see an x-ray of that guy
[41:13.550 --> 41:14.110]  in that moment.
[41:14.870 --> 41:16.910]  It's how sidearm is.
[41:17.030 --> 41:17.970]  Where's his spine?
[41:19.930 --> 41:20.730]  That's crazy.
[41:21.190 --> 41:23.150]  Some sidearm guys. They used to call them
[41:23.150 --> 41:25.230]  submarine pitchers. Oh, you're gonna hate this.
[41:25.770 --> 41:26.590]  Oh, Gavin.
[41:26.810 --> 41:28.310]  Oh, you're gonna hate this.
[41:29.390 --> 41:30.590]  Gavin, check out baseball.
[41:31.430 --> 41:32.850]  That's a submarine pitcher?
[41:33.510 --> 41:34.710]  What's going on?
[41:34.810 --> 41:36.790]  How about this? There's a guy pitching at like
[41:36.790 --> 41:38.450]  ankle level, almost?
[41:39.770 --> 41:40.350]  What is this?
[41:40.350 --> 41:41.770]  It's just a sidearm throw.
[41:42.310 --> 41:43.570]  For the audience...
[41:43.570 --> 41:46.150]  For the audience, we're just
[41:46.910 --> 41:48.250]  showing Gavin pictures
[41:48.250 --> 41:50.610]  of people throwing sidearm halfway
[41:50.610 --> 41:52.550]  through the swing so their arm is going the wrong way.
[41:53.150 --> 41:54.630]  When I went to the arcade with you,
[41:54.770 --> 41:56.330]  Gavin, that you don't remember,
[41:56.490 --> 41:58.810]  that's how you threw. You were a sidearm thrower.
[41:58.810 --> 42:00.030]  You're a submarine pitcher?
[42:00.390 --> 42:02.850]  He is a submarine pitcher. And he is quite
[42:02.850 --> 42:03.250]  accurate.
[42:03.670 --> 42:05.630]  I look so broken.
[42:06.110 --> 42:08.530]  That's how you throw. I was shocked by the four,
[42:08.630 --> 42:10.650]  but I couldn't complain. You're getting tickets.
[42:11.730 --> 42:11.930]  Huh.
[42:12.070 --> 42:13.250]  Was I doing that?
[42:13.510 --> 42:15.370]  You were. You were 100%.
[42:15.370 --> 42:16.650]  Sidearm thrower.
[42:18.530 --> 42:19.530]  That's so funny.
[42:20.210 --> 42:22.350]  I have a question for you, Gavin,
[42:22.830 --> 42:23.950]  regarding Tone in the Hole.
[42:24.430 --> 42:25.390]  Very serious question.
[42:25.390 --> 42:26.030]  Okay.
[42:27.610 --> 42:29.430]  What percent British
[42:29.430 --> 42:31.130]  does a person need to be to qualify,
[42:31.430 --> 42:32.950]  would you say, to be on Tone in the Hole?
[42:33.410 --> 42:35.390]  What level of Brit can you stand
[42:35.390 --> 42:36.990]  being around before it's too much?
[42:37.550 --> 42:39.190]  Like if their DNA, if they were like
[42:39.950 --> 42:41.290]  70%. I don't think it's DNA.
[42:41.430 --> 42:42.590]  I think it's if you've lived there.
[42:42.790 --> 42:45.650]  Okay, so even if you genetically
[42:46.610 --> 42:47.570]  had a majority
[42:47.570 --> 42:49.530]  of your ancestry there, it doesn't count.
[42:49.610 --> 42:50.190]  You have to live there.
[42:50.990 --> 42:53.570]  Yeah, I think you have to have lived in the culture.
[42:54.210 --> 42:55.090]  Got it. Okay.
[42:55.590 --> 42:57.290]  Like I'm half Italian.
[42:57.630 --> 42:59.430]  Do I know anything about Italy? Nope.
[42:59.670 --> 43:01.210]  That's fair. Yeah, I was just curious
[43:01.210 --> 43:03.350]  if it was like a sense for you or like
[43:03.890 --> 43:05.470]  based on what Geoff said, you hate all
[43:05.470 --> 43:07.030]  other British people or European people?
[43:08.070 --> 43:09.930]  No, he doesn't
[43:09.930 --> 43:11.610]  hate all the British people. He doesn't like
[43:11.610 --> 43:13.630]  to be around other British people in America.
[43:14.210 --> 43:15.610]  That clearly makes him uncomfortable.
[43:15.950 --> 43:17.370]  I met a British person
[43:17.370 --> 43:19.870]  at a bar three days ago.
[43:20.070 --> 43:21.690]  Loved it. Had a lovely little chat.
[43:21.690 --> 43:23.330]  How many episodes of Toad in the Hole
[43:23.330 --> 43:24.210]  do you think they would have lasted?
[43:25.030 --> 43:26.970]  I think we could have done one episode of Toad in the Hole.
[43:27.270 --> 43:29.050]  Really? A full episode? Yeah.
[43:29.450 --> 43:31.470]  That's great. I'd ask him like, you know, what brought him
[43:31.470 --> 43:32.550]  to Austin, all that stuff.
[43:33.810 --> 43:35.170]  He said he worked in media.
[43:35.350 --> 43:37.390]  Yeah, I could have done at least an episode of Toad
[43:37.390 --> 43:39.030]  in the Hole. That's great.
[43:39.710 --> 43:41.330]  I think it almost becomes
[43:41.330 --> 43:43.330]  worse the further it goes in Toad in the Hole.
[43:43.650 --> 43:45.090]  Because that's like the end of the route.
[43:45.490 --> 43:47.190]  If you went like 25
[43:47.190 --> 43:49.310]  episodes with somebody, something goes
[43:49.310 --> 43:50.870]  wrong for that Toad in the Hole to become.
[43:51.890 --> 43:53.510]  It becomes like a full-time job
[43:53.510 --> 43:54.750]  and then a Toad in the Hole.
[43:55.730 --> 43:57.230]  I think it's almost more
[43:57.230 --> 43:59.270]  offensive because if you Toad in the Hole somebody
[43:59.270 --> 44:01.310]  within five minutes, you don't have an opportunity
[44:01.310 --> 44:03.350]  to really know who they are. But if you
[44:03.350 --> 44:05.410]  spend 26 episodes with somebody
[44:05.410 --> 44:07.170]  and then Toad in the Hole them,
[44:07.370 --> 44:09.290]  they're done. You've evaluated it.
[44:09.330 --> 44:11.250]  You've gotten a good sample size and you just
[44:11.250 --> 44:12.450]  think there's nothing else there.
[44:12.950 --> 44:15.470]  Isn't that just, on a much longer scale,
[44:15.550 --> 44:17.170]  how friendship works? Sort of,
[44:17.170 --> 44:19.170]  I guess. Yeah, but I think this is worse because...
[44:20.490 --> 44:21.090]  You don't necessarily
[44:21.090 --> 44:23.330]  say Toad in the Hole, but you just drift apart
[44:23.330 --> 44:25.330]  from some people. Yeah, you change as people
[44:25.330 --> 44:27.190]  with time, but there's not enough time for you
[44:27.190 --> 44:29.050]  to change as a person when doing
[44:29.050 --> 44:31.090]  a Toad in the Hole thing, so that wouldn't be the issue.
[44:32.430 --> 44:33.270]  But you're right, it is
[44:33.270 --> 44:34.370]  a condensed version of it.
[44:35.150 --> 44:36.970]  Do we need to recap what Toad in the Hole is for the
[44:37.750 --> 44:38.470]  newer listeners?
[44:39.270 --> 44:41.090]  Toad in the Hole is a podcast,
[44:41.650 --> 44:43.290]  I guess, a side show
[44:43.290 --> 44:45.290]  of this show that we joked about doing
[44:45.290 --> 44:47.030]  where Gavin would interview,
[44:47.230 --> 44:49.070]  not even interview, just have conversations
[44:49.070 --> 44:50.690]  with other British people.
[44:51.050 --> 44:53.050]  And whenever he got sick of the conversation, he'd yell
[44:53.050 --> 44:55.030]  Toad in the Hole, and a new British person
[44:55.030 --> 44:56.590]  would take their spot.
[44:57.230 --> 44:59.090]  All based on Geoff saying that I apparently
[44:59.090 --> 45:00.830]  hate all British people that I come across
[45:00.830 --> 45:02.370]  in America.
[45:03.090 --> 45:04.670]  Until three days ago, I would agree. But I
[45:05.150 --> 45:07.050]  don't even know that this person exists, to be honest with you.
[45:07.110 --> 45:09.290]  If you didn't record with him, for all I know, you invented this
[45:09.290 --> 45:10.090]  to strengthen him.
[45:11.790 --> 45:13.270]  He's had this in his back pocket
[45:13.270 --> 45:15.550]  for weeks, since we brought it up
[45:15.550 --> 45:17.150]  initially. He's just been waiting
[45:17.150 --> 45:19.210]  to deploy it. This has been
[45:19.210 --> 45:20.210]  a fascinating episode.
[45:20.970 --> 45:23.370]  How have you guys been doing? We haven't really spoken
[45:23.370 --> 45:25.210]  a lot in the past week. I haven't even
[45:25.210 --> 45:27.050]  looked at my notes for this week. Really?
[45:27.410 --> 45:29.250]  Do you have many notes? Oh, I have one note.
[45:29.670 --> 45:31.330]  Oh, what's your note? Well,
[45:31.590 --> 45:33.050]  Regulation Animation came out.
[45:33.410 --> 45:35.790]  It did. People seem to love it.
[45:36.070 --> 45:37.270]  We should mention that.
[45:37.330 --> 45:39.210]  Please watch it. It's on Rooster Teeth. It's on
[45:39.210 --> 45:39.670]  YouTube.
[45:40.090 --> 45:40.730]  It's on there.
[45:41.370 --> 45:43.810]  It's not getting as many views as our live-action stuff does,
[45:43.850 --> 45:45.830]  and I wish it would, because it was a lot more work.
[45:46.170 --> 45:47.890]  And I think it's gorgeous. Oh, way more work.
[45:48.230 --> 45:49.370]  Like 50 times more work.
[45:49.630 --> 45:51.050]  Yeah, 5 billion times more work.
[45:51.870 --> 45:53.930]  Yeah, I watched the early cut,
[45:54.030 --> 45:55.490]  I guess, before it came out, and then
[45:55.490 --> 45:57.690]  when I went to watch it after it came out,
[45:58.050 --> 45:59.890]  I saw that someone had sort of chimed in
[45:59.890 --> 46:01.730]  on the end of it, recording a little bit
[46:01.730 --> 46:03.750]  of live-action stuff with
[46:04.430 --> 46:05.590]  uncensored f*** faces.
[46:06.550 --> 46:06.910]  Oh!
[46:06.910 --> 46:08.810]  I did see that as well.
[46:08.810 --> 46:10.250]  I mean, it's not really part of the show, it's just
[46:10.250 --> 46:12.330]  an additional piece that they said,
[46:12.390 --> 46:14.110]  hey, can you do this quickly? And then,
[46:14.590 --> 46:16.930]  I will say, nobody on their end
[46:16.930 --> 46:18.930]  edited it, they just
[46:18.930 --> 46:20.870]  asked me to do this suddenly.
[46:21.050 --> 46:21.930]  Whose day? That was it.
[46:22.710 --> 46:24.950]  That would be animation, I suppose?
[46:25.810 --> 46:26.130]  Right.
[46:26.810 --> 46:27.050]  Pfft.
[46:32.890 --> 46:33.810]  I mean,
[46:33.910 --> 46:35.210]  do we let
[46:35.210 --> 46:37.170]  f*** face not get bleeped?
[46:38.110 --> 46:39.090]  Isn't that a general
[46:39.090 --> 46:41.330]  sort of brand-wide rule?
[46:41.510 --> 46:42.930]  That stupid rule that we've come up with?
[46:43.370 --> 46:45.070]  Well, I think... It's not in the show,
[46:45.510 --> 46:47.250]  so... It is in the show if you put
[46:47.250 --> 46:48.550]  it in the fricking episode!
[46:48.810 --> 46:49.690]  It's not in the episode.
[46:50.610 --> 46:52.350]  It's literally in the YouTube video.
[46:52.650 --> 46:54.470]  The episode ends, and then it goes to that.
[46:54.470 --> 46:56.070]  That's the end, it's before the credits.
[46:56.930 --> 46:58.570]  Yeah, the episode is animation.
[46:59.170 --> 47:01.190]  Yeah, do you think me talking
[47:01.190 --> 47:02.470]  against a wall is animation?
[47:02.710 --> 47:04.330]  That's not drawn, Gavin, that's just me.
[47:04.330 --> 47:06.050]  Do you think I'm animation?
[47:08.810 --> 47:09.330]  Whatever.
[47:09.810 --> 47:11.650]  When I say f*** face, is it bleeped?
[47:14.110 --> 47:14.970]  Can I...
[47:16.690 --> 47:17.730]  I'm with them.
[47:18.230 --> 47:18.890]  You're wrong on this.
[47:19.290 --> 47:21.210]  Can I just say...
[47:21.210 --> 47:24.330]  If you watch a f***ing movie, the trailers aren't part
[47:24.330 --> 47:26.250]  of the movie. It's a different thing.
[47:26.730 --> 47:28.290]  They're not all the same thing.
[47:28.530 --> 47:29.210]  Things end.
[47:29.830 --> 47:30.310]  How about this?
[47:30.310 --> 47:32.750]  I get it, but it's still on our channel.
[47:32.910 --> 47:35.010]  It's not like it's a Twitter video.
[47:35.490 --> 47:36.650]  In Gavin's defense,
[47:37.390 --> 47:38.810]  is a post-credits scene
[47:38.810 --> 47:39.830]  a part of a movie still?
[47:39.990 --> 47:41.970]  If it's in a Marvel movie, it probably is, right?
[47:42.370 --> 47:44.710]  I mean, typically a post-credits scene
[47:44.710 --> 47:46.670]  isn't somebody just spiking the camera
[47:46.670 --> 47:48.690]  and going, hey, if you like that, check out
[47:48.690 --> 47:49.650]  comic books.
[47:49.770 --> 47:50.690]  No, that's true.
[47:57.970 --> 47:58.850]  I also...
[47:58.850 --> 47:59.950]  I feel like the post-credits scene
[47:59.950 --> 48:01.610]  rarely has anything to do with the film.
[48:02.970 --> 48:04.430]  It's setting up something else.
[48:05.670 --> 48:07.130]  Sometimes not even canon, really.
[48:07.390 --> 48:10.330]  But it's just weird to hear it.
[48:10.490 --> 48:10.930]  Uncensored.
[48:11.690 --> 48:12.170]  It is.
[48:12.330 --> 48:13.890]  I would agree with you there.
[48:14.290 --> 48:14.910]  It is strange.
[48:15.230 --> 48:16.990]  It's not like we're talking about it on a different podcast
[48:16.990 --> 48:18.190]  where it wouldn't be censored.
[48:18.450 --> 48:18.790]  It's true.
[48:19.210 --> 48:20.650]  This is a great...
[48:21.930 --> 48:22.290]  This...
[48:22.650 --> 48:24.510]  I've been struggling with something for a couple weeks
[48:24.510 --> 48:25.850]  and this is a great point to mention it.
[48:27.510 --> 48:28.650]  I really hate
[48:28.650 --> 48:30.250]  the name F***face at this point.
[48:30.370 --> 48:31.630]  It's really wearing me down.
[48:32.030 --> 48:34.690]  I don't know, man. I go back and forth
[48:34.690 --> 48:36.790]  with it. I did it to prank myself
[48:36.790 --> 48:37.930]  because I knew I would get here.
[48:38.230 --> 48:39.810]  And I've been here a few times, you know?
[48:40.590 --> 48:42.470]  It comes in waves where I think it's
[48:42.470 --> 48:44.510]  incredibly funny and then I hate it
[48:44.510 --> 48:46.130]  and then I think it's funny and then I hate it.
[48:46.430 --> 48:48.770]  And it's like this self-loathing, making fun of myself
[48:48.770 --> 48:49.810]  and enjoying myself kind of thing.
[48:49.950 --> 48:51.750]  But I'm definitely on the like...
[48:51.750 --> 48:55.070]  I just don't like it right now. It's f***ing annoying me.
[48:55.270 --> 48:56.610]  I'll get back to the other side soon.
[48:56.750 --> 48:57.350]  But god damn.
[48:57.730 --> 48:59.530]  I mean, you did it. It's your idea.
[49:00.950 --> 49:02.990]  I really like the way it looks
[49:02.990 --> 49:04.050]  in the logo.
[49:04.330 --> 49:05.050]  I love the logo.
[49:06.330 --> 49:09.250]  So you think that F***face should always be censored, Gavin?
[49:09.430 --> 49:10.670]  I think in our content
[49:10.670 --> 49:12.690]  obviously if you talk about it elsewhere
[49:12.690 --> 49:14.190]  in different videos, it's not going to be censored.
[49:14.410 --> 49:16.710]  If it's on our channel, in our content, in a video
[49:16.710 --> 49:18.670]  that we made, yeah, it should be censored.
[49:18.710 --> 49:20.590]  Okay, I'll ask him to censor it.
[49:20.990 --> 49:21.250]  I'll say,
[49:22.470 --> 49:24.950]  I'll say, Gavin said censor this, please.
[49:25.810 --> 49:26.210]  And...
[49:26.210 --> 49:28.190]  I'm not making the call. I'm just throwing it to the group.
[49:28.230 --> 49:29.110]  What does everyone else think?
[49:29.590 --> 49:32.270]  I think that we should endeavor going forward
[49:32.730 --> 49:34.590]  to make sure it's always censored
[49:34.590 --> 49:36.810]  in content that we release
[49:36.810 --> 49:37.890]  under the F***face umbrella.
[49:38.210 --> 49:40.510]  But I think it's folly to go back and
[49:40.510 --> 49:41.370]  re-upload that video.
[49:41.530 --> 49:42.990]  Oh yeah, don't go back.
[49:42.990 --> 49:44.950]  I'm just saying, to me, one of the funny
[49:44.950 --> 49:46.850]  gags in F***face is that it's censored
[49:46.850 --> 49:49.230]  when you say it that way, but not when you just say the word on its own.
[49:49.810 --> 49:50.770]  I will say...
[49:50.770 --> 49:52.810]  I used to think it was funny too.
[49:53.450 --> 49:54.590]  Is it not funny anymore?
[49:55.690 --> 49:57.410]  I'm just down on the name right now.
[49:58.070 --> 49:59.210]  It'll be funny to me again
[49:59.210 --> 50:00.130]  in like a week, I'm sure.
[50:00.510 --> 50:02.950]  I think it's interesting, just going through our text, I mean, you did make a
[50:02.950 --> 50:04.890]  differentiator in content, but
[50:04.890 --> 50:06.750]  you just use F***face uncensored
[50:06.750 --> 50:07.570]  all the time.
[50:08.090 --> 50:11.110]  You, and our text messages,
[50:11.110 --> 50:13.170]  and you mention a F***face, you don't use the censors.
[50:13.550 --> 50:14.130]  You just spell it.
[50:14.770 --> 50:16.270]  Well yeah, it's written down.
[50:16.710 --> 50:18.750]  Yeah, but I censor it whenever I write it.
[50:18.870 --> 50:21.470]  Do you really? Every time. So much effort to
[50:21.470 --> 50:22.990]  shift hate. It absolutely is.
[50:23.350 --> 50:25.030]  But it's the name, it's what it's called.
[50:25.310 --> 50:27.130]  I'm gonna search my messages to see if I ever
[50:27.130 --> 50:27.930]  typed it censored.
[50:28.290 --> 50:31.190]  I don't think I ever have typed it censored.
[50:31.410 --> 50:33.350]  Am I the only one that's been writing it censored
[50:33.350 --> 50:34.790]  everywhere, whenever I talk about it?
[50:34.990 --> 50:37.230]  Probably, yeah. I'm too committed to the
[50:37.230 --> 50:38.970]  bit, I guess. Maybe I should start doing that.
[50:38.970 --> 50:40.650]  Maybe if I'm kicking off so much about Eric
[50:40.650 --> 50:42.890]  putting it uncensored in a video, maybe I should...
[50:42.890 --> 50:44.970]  It's nice that you're seeing that, and I didn't
[50:44.970 --> 50:46.830]  have to say it. Thank you very much. I've already made
[50:46.830 --> 50:47.450]  the ask, though.
[50:49.550 --> 50:50.830]  I mean, I've already done it.
[50:50.870 --> 50:52.550]  I've already made the ask, so I'm not retracting it.
[50:52.770 --> 50:53.830]  Now we'll see if it happens.
[50:54.390 --> 50:56.850]  I was just throwing it to the group. It wasn't really an action thing.
[50:57.010 --> 50:58.490]  I just thought it was interesting.
[50:59.010 --> 51:00.390]  No, it was an action thing.
[51:01.850 --> 51:02.690]  It's funny that
[51:02.690 --> 51:04.790]  it's a discussion.
[51:05.870 --> 51:06.950]  Well, we're talking about
[51:06.950 --> 51:08.750]  texts, because this perfectly
[51:08.750 --> 51:11.330]  segues into a thing I wanted to bring up
[51:11.330 --> 51:12.950]  for a while. It's been on my notes
[51:12.950 --> 51:14.210]  for a few weeks at this point.
[51:14.690 --> 51:16.470]  Have you ever noticed, Geoff,
[51:17.230 --> 51:18.190]  that Gavin
[51:18.890 --> 51:20.330]  is a three-ha man
[51:20.950 --> 51:22.730]  in your text conversations with him?
[51:23.750 --> 51:25.130]  Gavin very rarely
[51:25.130 --> 51:26.590]  goes beyond the three-has.
[51:27.610 --> 51:29.070]  Occasionally, rarely, he gives you
[51:29.070 --> 51:30.730]  two-has, which is acceptable.
[51:31.850 --> 51:33.150]  But I have
[51:33.150 --> 51:34.990]  almost never gotten more than
[51:34.990 --> 51:37.050]  three-has out of Gavin in anything
[51:37.050 --> 51:39.130]  I've ever said. Well, here's how my-has
[51:39.130 --> 51:39.850]  work, typically.
[51:40.910 --> 51:42.770]  Like a ha-ha, that's probably
[51:42.770 --> 51:44.030]  the same as typing lol.
[51:44.270 --> 51:46.590]  Did you really lol? Probably not. It's just funny.
[51:47.830 --> 51:49.230]  But a three-ha
[51:49.230 --> 51:51.150]  to me is like, that's funny.
[51:51.890 --> 51:52.930]  That is pretty funny.
[51:53.190 --> 51:54.670]  But any more than that is like
[51:54.670 --> 51:56.090]  I actually burst out laughing.
[51:56.290 --> 51:58.970]  So you just don't actually burst out laughing at anything Andrew
[51:58.970 --> 52:00.910]  ever says. I feel like I have done.
[52:01.150 --> 52:03.190]  I must have given you four-has before.
[52:03.190 --> 52:05.350]  Oh, it happens occasionally. Very rarely.
[52:06.010 --> 52:07.070]  But I'm saying, I'm asking Geoff,
[52:07.130 --> 52:09.490]  have you ever noticed this? Have you ever looked at your-has
[52:09.490 --> 52:11.130]  with Gavin? Usually when
[52:11.130 --> 52:13.190]  Gavin and I text, I get seven or eight-has from him.
[52:13.570 --> 52:13.890]  Really?
[52:15.370 --> 52:17.270]  No, I don't know. I will say this
[52:17.270 --> 52:17.530]  though.
[52:19.210 --> 52:21.170]  Two-has in my family
[52:21.170 --> 52:23.190]  is an insult. If somebody responds
[52:23.190 --> 52:25.110]  with two-has, that's like a thumbs-up
[52:25.110 --> 52:27.130]  emoji. That's like a gentle
[52:27.130 --> 52:28.250]  like, fuck you.
[52:28.890 --> 52:30.890]  It wasn't funny enough.
[52:30.890 --> 52:32.410]  So I'm just gonna give you
[52:32.410 --> 52:34.470]  the most basic of-has.
[52:34.750 --> 52:36.630]  If you ever text Emily
[52:36.630 --> 52:38.870]  two-has, she will think
[52:38.870 --> 52:39.870]  you're upsetting her. Interesting.
[52:40.210 --> 52:42.970]  If I text any of you
[52:42.970 --> 52:44.610]  two-has, that's what it means.
[52:44.810 --> 52:46.730]  It means I wasn't entertained
[52:46.730 --> 52:48.910]  at all. I'm not sure how this
[52:48.910 --> 52:49.530]  will make you feel, but
[52:50.230 --> 52:52.450]  on the 3rd of November
[52:53.290 --> 52:54.730]  and this Sunday
[52:54.730 --> 52:56.810]  I gave two different people
[52:56.810 --> 52:59.230]  four-has. You gave four-has?
[52:59.230 --> 53:01.390]  I gave four-has to Jason Saldana
[53:01.390 --> 53:03.250]  who had a funny
[53:03.250 --> 53:04.750]  dream about me and
[53:04.750 --> 53:07.270]  Daniel Fabello who sent me a funny
[53:07.270 --> 53:08.230]  edit.
[53:09.250 --> 53:11.050]  And they both made me laugh out loud.
[53:12.390 --> 53:13.330]  I have to go so
[53:13.330 --> 53:15.290]  fucking far back in my texts to find a
[53:15.290 --> 53:17.030]  text from Gavin. Jesus Christ.
[53:17.830 --> 53:19.570]  Interesting. Oh my god.
[53:19.750 --> 53:21.110]  The last time Gavin
[53:21.110 --> 53:23.170]  texted me. Is this where I find out we're not friends
[53:23.170 --> 53:25.130]  anymore? The last time Gavin texted
[53:25.130 --> 53:25.430]  me.
[53:26.690 --> 53:27.530]  I'll be honest, most
[53:27.530 --> 53:29.270]  of the four-has, I'm receiving.
[53:30.670 --> 53:31.490]  The last time
[53:31.490 --> 53:33.530]  Gavin texted me, I think it was October 16th.
[53:33.690 --> 53:34.310]  That's not too bad.
[53:36.070 --> 53:36.710]  Three weeks.
[53:37.450 --> 53:39.410]  I mean, I find that people I see in
[53:39.410 --> 53:41.550]  real life a lot, or communicate with a lot,
[53:41.870 --> 53:43.610]  I don't necessarily text a lot.
[53:44.270 --> 53:45.410]  It's fascinating that you
[53:45.410 --> 53:47.130]  think the two-has is an offense.
[53:47.270 --> 53:49.470]  For me, it's more of an acknowledgement
[53:49.470 --> 53:51.490]  that something funny was attempted.
[53:51.930 --> 53:53.630]  Or it was mildly... Yeah, something funny
[53:53.630 --> 53:55.750]  was attempted. That is exactly
[53:55.750 --> 53:57.510]  what it means. It's like, oh, you tried.
[53:57.670 --> 53:59.690]  Okay, here you go. I think most often
[53:59.690 --> 54:01.690]  I'll write it after something I've said.
[54:02.230 --> 54:03.750]  The has? The four-has? Like laughing at yourself?
[54:03.790 --> 54:05.770]  No, the two-has. Two-has.
[54:05.910 --> 54:07.650]  Oh, I see. Yeah, sometimes
[54:07.650 --> 54:09.610]  it can be used as, like, a tone setter.
[54:10.470 --> 54:11.690]  Yeah, like, I just did
[54:11.690 --> 54:12.990]  this dumb thing. Yeah.
[54:13.770 --> 54:15.410]  Exactly. Hey,
[54:16.870 --> 54:17.590]  were... Hey, Gavin,
[54:17.710 --> 54:19.530]  would you do me a favor? Could you try to throw a couple
[54:19.530 --> 54:21.370]  extra has Andrew's way every once in a while?
[54:21.370 --> 54:23.510]  I think emotionally he could use it.
[54:23.530 --> 54:25.350]  No, I could. I've definitely
[54:25.350 --> 54:27.410]  said him four-has. I just feel like I need to
[54:27.410 --> 54:29.230]  find out what caused them.
[54:29.790 --> 54:31.470]  You know he's trying, so just
[54:31.470 --> 54:33.030]  be a little more liberal with your has.
[54:33.850 --> 54:35.150]  Um, I just...
[54:36.290 --> 54:37.130]  We're 55
[54:37.130 --> 54:39.390]  minutes in, and I just realized, weren't we
[54:39.390 --> 54:41.270]  supposed to do the stupid icy hot again
[54:41.270 --> 54:42.970]  because Eric bitched out last time?
[54:43.090 --> 54:44.990]  Oh, shit. We were.
[54:45.650 --> 54:45.970]  No.
[54:47.110 --> 54:49.590]  I think we were, right? Eric and Nick didn't do it,
[54:49.590 --> 54:51.390]  and so we were gonna have to go one more time so that
[54:51.390 --> 54:53.870]  all five of us could be miserable at the same time. That was gonna...
[54:53.870 --> 54:55.070]  Yeah, that was supposed to happen.
[54:55.230 --> 54:57.730]  Thank God we're doing two episodes today,
[54:57.770 --> 54:59.770]  right? Why is Eric not saying anything about it?
[55:00.430 --> 55:01.470]  Oh, I don't have icy hot.
[55:01.730 --> 55:02.970]  OH MY GOD!
[55:05.840 --> 55:06.200]  That's...
[55:06.200 --> 55:08.740]  I could put, like, you want me to use, like, regular lotion?
[55:09.020 --> 55:10.040]  And I could pretend like...
[55:10.880 --> 55:11.980]  Like, oh no!
[55:12.680 --> 55:14.400]  So goopy! Goopy?
[55:14.940 --> 55:16.620]  That's what you'd say? So goopy?
[55:17.060 --> 55:18.300]  Yeah, is it goopy?
[55:18.300 --> 55:19.040]  No!
[55:19.460 --> 55:22.460]  I'm going to get you a lifetime supply of
[55:22.460 --> 55:23.620]  icy hot for Christmas, Eric.
[55:23.760 --> 55:26.600]  I mean, a lifetime supply for me, I think, would probably be just the one tube
[55:26.600 --> 55:27.740]  because I don't use it for anything.
[55:29.380 --> 55:30.180]  So... thank...
[55:30.180 --> 55:32.020]  you? I'll get you at least ten.
[55:32.280 --> 55:32.440]  Yeah.
[55:33.340 --> 55:35.840]  If you can make me cookies again, that would be great.
[55:35.980 --> 55:37.500]  That was a great Christmas gift one time.
[55:37.500 --> 55:40.640]  Do you think, Geoff, that Eric snuck in
[55:40.640 --> 55:42.280]  the sneaky animal question before
[55:42.280 --> 55:44.320]  we started just to throw us off track
[55:44.320 --> 55:45.740]  so we couldn't...
[55:45.740 --> 55:47.620]  Oh no, if you would have brought up the icy hot thing
[55:47.620 --> 55:49.380]  right at the beginning, I would have told you I didn't have it.
[55:49.460 --> 55:51.760]  Oh, I don't care. The sneaky animal thing, I still...
[55:51.760 --> 55:53.720]  I'm still kind of flummoxed that we don't know
[55:53.720 --> 55:55.800]  what the sneakiest animal is and that you still think it's a
[55:55.800 --> 55:56.720]  fish for some reason.
[55:57.740 --> 55:58.660]  Doesn't make sense to me.
[56:00.020 --> 56:01.820]  I just think it's... you're always surprised.
[56:02.040 --> 56:03.160]  We don't need to go over old ground, though.
[56:03.520 --> 56:05.780]  Yeah, you should have had it. But I'm okay that you don't.
[56:05.980 --> 56:07.940]  Oh, I found a ha-ha-ha-ha.
[56:08.280 --> 56:08.600]  Congrats.
[56:11.060 --> 56:11.700]  Feb 19th.
[56:11.700 --> 56:13.860]  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
[56:13.880 --> 56:14.280]  Wow.
[56:16.100 --> 56:17.620]  You said, just paused
[56:17.620 --> 56:19.840]  to fix a technical difficulty. I don't remember
[56:19.840 --> 56:21.880]  this, but apparently last time I was streaming this for you
[56:21.880 --> 56:23.720]  I didn't have any audio. I said it was
[56:23.720 --> 56:25.640]  just game audio. Wasn't it?
[56:25.760 --> 56:27.720]  You said, no, apparently not. Just lost my
[56:27.720 --> 56:29.820]  save to reset audio for the
[56:29.820 --> 56:31.760]  audience. Oh, my misery. That was the donkey
[56:31.760 --> 56:32.500]  constraints.
[56:33.640 --> 56:35.280]  My pain is the four ha's.
[56:35.500 --> 56:36.700]  That was four ha's.
[56:38.840 --> 56:39.700]  Because I was...
[56:39.700 --> 56:41.660]  I think I just landed. I was in the airport
[56:41.660 --> 56:42.780]  just laughing at myself.
[56:43.820 --> 56:46.060]  My misery, telling stories
[56:46.060 --> 56:47.660]  about dreams that you're in
[56:47.660 --> 56:49.560]  and edits are what I need
[56:49.560 --> 56:51.840]  if I want to consist, if I want to bump up my four ha
[56:51.840 --> 56:52.180]  writing.
[56:54.660 --> 56:55.540]  You can't
[56:55.540 --> 56:56.660]  try and force a four ha.
[56:57.820 --> 56:59.760]  I five or six or seven
[56:59.760 --> 57:01.620]  ha you in real life on f*** face.
[57:01.920 --> 57:03.160]  Yeah, but that's different. That's for work.
[57:03.420 --> 57:05.800]  Do you think, like you're performing
[57:05.800 --> 57:07.740]  here, it's not, this isn't even the real
[57:07.740 --> 57:09.640]  you. This is the character you play on
[57:09.640 --> 57:10.480]  internet content.
[57:11.740 --> 57:13.760]  That's one of my favorite
[57:13.760 --> 57:15.960]  criticisms we get of all time is that we're playing characters.
[57:16.340 --> 57:17.160]  That's awesome.
[57:17.440 --> 57:19.380]  Do you think
[57:20.120 --> 57:21.400]  Andrew, now, that
[57:21.400 --> 57:23.720]  if and when the next time you receive
[57:23.720 --> 57:25.480]  a four or five ha from Gavin
[57:25.480 --> 57:27.160]  that you'll believe it's true?
[57:27.680 --> 57:29.760]  Or do you think now, at some point, somewhere
[57:29.760 --> 57:31.320]  in the back of your mind, you're always going to question,
[57:31.660 --> 57:33.600]  is he just, you know,
[57:33.800 --> 57:35.820]  is he just entertaining me? Is he being kind to me right now
[57:35.820 --> 57:37.620]  by giving me four ha's? Is it really four ha's?
[57:38.820 --> 57:40.120]  Or is he channeling
[57:40.120 --> 57:41.800]  that conversation we had and trying to cut me
[57:41.800 --> 57:43.940]  some slack? Yeah, I think there's definitely
[57:43.940 --> 57:45.940]  going to be a reviewing, and there
[57:45.940 --> 57:47.840]  will be scrutiny. Like, if I don't think
[57:47.840 --> 57:49.900]  it deserves four ha's, but he gives me four ha's,
[57:50.060 --> 57:51.180]  I'd call him out on it.
[57:51.600 --> 57:53.820]  All you're doing is making me self-conscious about how many
[57:53.820 --> 57:55.940]  ha's I'm getting. I've got to try
[57:55.940 --> 57:57.760]  and not let it affect me. Well, he's
[57:57.760 --> 57:59.760]  pretty self-conscious about how many ha's he's
[57:59.760 --> 58:01.820]  receiving from you, so it sounds like you're on equal footing
[58:01.820 --> 58:03.840]  now. No, it's just, I remember I got
[58:03.840 --> 58:06.000]  four ha's, and I was like, I never get four
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.960]  ha's, because Geoff, you're very generous with your
[58:07.960 --> 58:09.900]  ha's. So am I, I feel like. I
[58:09.900 --> 58:11.720]  enjoy laughing. Yeah, me too.
[58:12.220 --> 58:14.140]  What's the point of living if you're not laughing?
[58:16.120 --> 58:18.020]  I know, it would be a problem if you only
[58:18.020 --> 58:19.280]  gave more than three ha's.
[58:19.880 --> 58:21.620]  That would be a psychotic move if
[58:21.620 --> 58:23.780]  no matter what it was, at least five,
[58:24.260 --> 58:25.540]  I'd be terrified of that person.
[58:26.000 --> 58:27.940]  Hmm. I found that funny,
[58:28.020 --> 58:28.980]  but my character didn't.
[58:29.820 --> 58:31.380]  What? Oh, I see.
[58:33.900 --> 58:35.980]  Can you believe we get to do this again
[58:35.980 --> 58:37.840]  in five minutes? I can. Oh, I'm excited.
[58:38.460 --> 58:39.860]  Me too. I didn't even get
[58:39.860 --> 58:42.040]  to my dumb notes. I'm so excited
[58:42.040 --> 58:43.940]  to see your notes. I don't have that many, and they're
[58:43.940 --> 58:46.100]  not that good. Great. Thanks for
[58:46.100 --> 58:48.280]  listening to another
[58:48.280 --> 58:49.820]  episode of the
[58:49.820 --> 58:51.760]  F*** Face Podcast. Who
[58:51.760 --> 58:53.920]  knows what's in store for us
[58:53.920 --> 58:55.940]  next week? Will I eat the mayonnaise?
[58:56.180 --> 58:58.220]  Will Eric improve his frisbees?
[58:58.500 --> 58:59.920]  Will Gavin be liberal
[58:59.920 --> 59:01.900]  with the ha's? You'll have to tune in to
[59:01.900 --> 59:04.320]  find out on
[59:04.320 --> 59:05.320]  F*** Face.
[59:06.080 --> 59:07.860]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here
[59:07.860 --> 59:10.120]  with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[59:10.460 --> 59:12.020]  Did Gavin take the best photo
[59:12.020 --> 59:13.740]  ever? Geoff gets passionate
[59:13.740 --> 59:16.020]  about milk. Andrew doesn't understand
[59:16.020 --> 59:18.020]  technology. What will the Thanksgiving
[59:18.020 --> 59:19.820]  episode be like? The boys
[59:19.820 --> 59:21.820]  like physical receipts. Let's see
[59:21.820 --> 59:23.860]  those mouse pads. And once again,
[59:24.040 --> 59:25.440]  Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[59:25.860 --> 59:27.880]  All that and more on next week's episode of
[59:27.880 --> 59:28.440]  F*** Face.
