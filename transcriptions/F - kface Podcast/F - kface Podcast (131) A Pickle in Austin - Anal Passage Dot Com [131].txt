[00:00.000 --> 00:03.060]  Mom, dad, my body is growing at an alarming rate.
[00:03.480 --> 00:07.240]  And the clothes you buy me now will be very small, very soon.
[00:07.360 --> 00:09.640]  But your wallet doesn't have to suffer because of fashion,
[00:09.780 --> 00:11.800]  with the low prices of Amazon's back-to-school.
[00:12.600 --> 00:14.780]  Amazon, spend less, smile more.
[00:40.200 --> 00:46.760]  One of the fifth season, uh, however, Eric said that the number doesn't really matter earlier for some reason,
[00:46.980 --> 00:49.000]  but we can say it at the beginning if we want to.
[00:49.360 --> 00:54.200]  Uh, I wanted to. With me as always, uh, Gavin and Andrew.
[00:54.400 --> 00:55.620]  How are you guys doing?
[00:55.780 --> 00:55.940]  Hello.
[00:56.460 --> 01:00.340]  I'm great. I-I need to make a clarification, uh, first off, immediately.
[01:00.700 --> 01:02.120]  Do you need to make another rubbish apology?
[01:02.820 --> 01:04.560]  No, I don't. You do, actually.
[01:05.060 --> 01:06.100]  No, I don't, but I'm kidding.
[01:07.020 --> 01:07.880]  Has he been trashing?
[01:08.420 --> 01:08.820]  No!
[01:09.200 --> 01:10.660]  Last episode, he trashed a bunch.
[01:11.300 --> 01:12.880]  Listen, this is my-
[01:12.880 --> 01:13.780]  He little rubbish bin.
[01:14.160 --> 01:17.380]  No, listen. This is something else, completely unrelated.
[01:18.080 --> 01:22.560]  I said that to celebrate the launch of the Gerpler, I would chug a thing of Bovril.
[01:22.720 --> 01:26.040]  I let people pick what I would chug out of the-the Gerpler.
[01:26.560 --> 01:28.900]  And I said I'd do Bovril because that was the number one voted item.
[01:29.160 --> 01:33.640]  I do not currently have access to the Gerpler, so this will be the next recording I would do that.
[01:33.700 --> 01:35.980]  I just need to do a little bit of housekeeping.
[01:35.980 --> 01:38.980]  And now it's free to take it wherever you guys want.
[01:39.300 --> 01:42.700]  Just so you know, it's not the next recording we're recording to today, so it'll be-
[01:42.700 --> 01:42.900]  Yes.
[01:44.040 --> 01:44.320]  Yes.
[01:44.840 --> 01:45.340]  Thank you, Eric.
[01:45.520 --> 01:46.200]  Where's your Gerpler?
[01:46.660 --> 01:47.640]  Uh, it's in the mail.
[01:48.500 --> 01:49.580]  Oh, okay, you haven't got it yet.
[01:49.880 --> 01:56.040]  Dude, can I- I gotta say, I filmed a little video on the Gerpler launch day of me, like, chugging a Ger- chugging a drink.
[01:56.540 --> 01:58.380]  Uh, I didn't realize that Gerpler's dangerous.
[01:59.020 --> 02:05.680]  It's got- I- I- I have the- the- the- the cups Jack stole from the pizza restaurant for me for my birthday.
[02:06.160 --> 02:09.140]  Uh, and those are, like, normal size, and that's what I've been kind of living out of.
[02:09.440 --> 02:15.280]  Uh, I started drinking the Gerpler- I drank an entire Diet Pepsi in one- one gulp without even realizing it.
[02:15.440 --> 02:21.640]  That mouth is so wide, it just funnels, like, it's- it's great responsibility and great power.
[02:22.080 --> 02:26.340]  Be careful when you wield the power of the Gerp, because-
[02:26.340 --> 02:29.780]  It's speed limited by the diameter of the opening of the receptacle.
[02:29.780 --> 02:33.120]  I didn't- I didn't realize it until the Gerpler, but yeah.
[02:33.700 --> 02:37.700]  So, probably- probably not most people, I'd be fucked.
[02:39.760 --> 02:42.760]  I should probably be a dog. I should probably only drink out of bowls.
[02:44.960 --> 02:54.820]  I, uh, anyway, but I imagine most people are civilized, but if you're like me, I- I- all of my civilized eating and drinking habits got ruined in the army,
[02:55.300 --> 02:59.680]  uh, by people yelling at me to speed up, and so- and I never- I never fixed that.
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.460]  I became an animal in the military. I think most people probably do when it comes to eating and drinking because of the way they make you do it.
[03:05.040 --> 03:10.880]  Uh, so yeah, I'm only limited by the- by the- by the angle of my- of my opening, I guess.
[03:11.200 --> 03:14.760]  Uh, so if you're like me, and you're a- a degenerate who was in the military, be careful with the Gerpler.
[03:14.820 --> 03:16.120]  If you're a normal person, you're probably fine.
[03:16.840 --> 03:17.340]  Good to know.
[03:17.640 --> 03:21.640]  That's so fascinating, I didn't realize that the size of the glass would impact the chug.
[03:22.240 --> 03:24.740]  That's a really- really good discovery to have.
[03:25.120 --> 03:30.820]  I, uh- I have a couple little discoveries that I've- want to talk about with you guys, uh, over the course of the next two episodes.
[03:31.440 --> 03:35.140]  By the way, I feel like I am talking a mile a fucking minute.
[03:35.440 --> 03:36.000]  I am-
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.000]  Are you so excited?
[03:37.320 --> 03:39.760]  I am so goddamn excited.
[03:39.960 --> 03:51.340]  I realized that about 2.15, I was just pacing around my house, going from room to room, just, like, looking at clocks, and, like, fucking, like, tapping my legs, and I couldn't slow down.
[03:51.340 --> 04:00.000]  I have ne- I don't know why, because I don't particularly enjoy you guys, but I have been so excited to record today, like, on fucking fire to record today.
[04:00.160 --> 04:02.260]  I guess it's because we haven't- we all haven't talked in a while.
[04:02.640 --> 04:02.840]  But holy shit, man.
[04:02.840 --> 04:05.040]  Yeah, that always happens to me when it- when we've had a gap.
[04:05.460 --> 04:06.480]  How long has it been, two weeks?
[04:06.820 --> 04:07.100]  Yeah.
[04:07.500 --> 04:07.840]  Two weeks.
[04:07.980 --> 04:08.360]  Two weeks.
[04:09.120 --> 04:09.440]  Goddamn.
[04:10.420 --> 04:10.860]  Yeah, it's been fun.
[04:11.420 --> 04:20.800]  I feel- I feel like one of those cars with the- like, one of those little matchbox cars where you, like, you wind the wheel back a bunch, and you drop it, and it fucking takes off.
[04:21.140 --> 04:21.880]  Oh, those are great.
[04:21.880 --> 04:23.500]  I feel like I'm just, like, spinning in my seat right now.
[04:23.800 --> 04:25.900]  Andrew tweeted something terrifying.
[04:26.480 --> 04:28.440]  What? Oh. Well, have you found it yet?
[04:28.940 --> 04:30.860]  And then he texted me saying, have you found it yet?
[04:31.480 --> 04:32.180]  I was just curious.
[04:32.700 --> 04:33.500]  What is this?
[04:33.920 --> 04:38.620]  Well, he tweeted- he tweeted a- he tweeted a picture of a pickle in Austin.
[04:39.240 --> 04:39.360]  Yeah.
[04:39.900 --> 04:41.400]  By that mural of Austin.
[04:43.020 --> 04:44.220]  So he's got one of his-
[04:44.220 --> 04:46.280]  You want me to drop in the Discord, or do you want to drop in the Discord?
[04:46.660 --> 04:48.720]  If you've got- if you've got it, you should post it.
[04:48.940 --> 04:49.540]  I absolutely have.
[04:49.540 --> 04:54.400]  Got one of his little- one of his little cronies to- to take a picture with a pickle.
[04:54.700 --> 04:56.900]  And then he texts me, uh, did you find it yet?
[04:57.800 --> 05:00.040]  And I haven't found it, and that's honestly scarier.
[05:00.960 --> 05:01.660]  Where is it?
[05:02.220 --> 05:04.600]  First of all, I think it's hilarious you think it's one of my cronies.
[05:04.700 --> 05:07.380]  Second of all, I can't believe you haven't found it yet.
[05:08.060 --> 05:09.060]  You don't think it's me?
[05:09.060 --> 05:09.940]  Definitely not.
[05:10.580 --> 05:10.800]  Why?
[05:11.200 --> 05:12.440]  I don't think it's you either.
[05:12.740 --> 05:13.380]  That's great.
[05:14.120 --> 05:15.240]  Why do you not think it's me?
[05:15.800 --> 05:17.720]  Cause you don't come here. You refuse.
[05:18.640 --> 05:19.040]  Okay.
[05:19.580 --> 05:20.020]  That's funny.
[05:20.480 --> 05:21.580]  I'm just shocked you haven't found it.
[05:21.820 --> 05:23.520]  Have you looked, like, extensively?
[05:24.460 --> 05:26.980]  Uh, where should I be looking? Like, in the- in the room?
[05:27.800 --> 05:29.220]  On the front porch? In the lawn?
[05:30.140 --> 05:30.920]  Well, you know.
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.920]  What, am I gonna be just snooping around like a crazy person?
[05:34.800 --> 05:36.880]  No, there's multiple places you could look.
[05:36.880 --> 05:41.120]  Well, you kind of know where I said I would leave it, so you can narrow it down a little bit.
[05:41.260 --> 05:42.940]  Wait, what did you say? Like, where the-
[05:42.940 --> 05:43.720]  The doorstep.
[05:43.980 --> 05:46.780]  Yeah, the doorstep was the rule within regulation of there.
[05:47.220 --> 05:50.780]  Who's to say there's only one cucumber? You could be sitting on one right now.
[05:51.540 --> 05:52.540]  There could be one on your monitor.
[05:52.820 --> 05:53.320]  Let me check.
[05:54.000 --> 05:54.200]  No.
[05:54.960 --> 05:58.220]  I mean, I'm checking because I wouldn't put it past you.
[05:58.700 --> 05:59.060]  No.
[05:59.600 --> 06:05.600]  But you do this thing where you're so vague, and you just do little proddy questions, and it makes me want to curl up.
[06:05.600 --> 06:07.560]  It's very funny that you don't think I'm there.
[06:08.200 --> 06:08.980]  It's great.
[06:09.580 --> 06:14.980]  As if you could- you could barely get a setup going in your home, in your room, where you live.
[06:15.400 --> 06:19.480]  Can you imagine you pulling together a f*** face recording setup in Austin?
[06:19.920 --> 06:20.480]  I can.
[06:21.220 --> 06:31.940]  Andrew, it takes you so long to get from your little island to us that if you got on your boat the minute we stopped recording the last episode, I still don't think you'd be here.
[06:32.200 --> 06:32.860]  That's fair.
[06:33.700 --> 06:36.040]  That's totally fair. I'm just- I'm surprised he hasn't found it.
[06:36.380 --> 06:41.020]  I was curious how long it would take Gavin to go into this, uh, paranoid cucumber situation.
[06:41.260 --> 06:42.720]  I'm glad we got into it immediately.
[06:42.980 --> 06:43.680]  How did no one find it?
[06:43.700 --> 06:44.700]  Stop thinking about it. What do you mean?
[06:46.240 --> 06:48.900]  It's there. I mean, it probably isn't going to start going bad.
[06:49.080 --> 06:49.760]  It's there.
[06:50.140 --> 06:50.520]  It's not.
[06:50.960 --> 06:51.620]  It is.
[06:53.120 --> 06:53.520]  Where?
[06:54.500 --> 06:55.400]  I told you.
[06:57.840 --> 06:58.700]  It's not there.
[06:59.260 --> 07:02.500]  Should he go look on his front porch right now, Andrew? Is that what you're saying?
[07:02.500 --> 07:10.260]  I mean, he can. I don't know, you know, could be hidden. Maybe I painted it. You don't- there's a lot of options. It could be camouflaged and you don't even see it.
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.280]  There could be a little light on top of it, like, uh, one of those fish.
[07:15.980 --> 07:16.800]  Distracting you away.
[07:17.420 --> 07:20.340]  So it's a- an anglerfish cucumber.
[07:20.760 --> 07:22.260]  It could be all sorts of things.
[07:22.980 --> 07:23.940]  I could go and check now.
[07:24.460 --> 07:26.700]  You could if you wanted to. It'd be funny if you did.
[07:27.800 --> 07:28.680]  I could go on my phone.
[07:28.680 --> 07:34.660]  I envision- I envision- do you guys ever watch the Pink Panther remakes with Steve Martin and Jon Renau?
[07:34.680 --> 07:34.920]  No.
[07:35.860 --> 07:43.040]  They're pretty funny. They're pretty funny. But they would do this thing where they would blend into the background of a wall by wearing a bodysuit that exactly matched the wall.
[07:43.480 --> 07:51.200]  I could just see, like, a brick or wooden shaped bodysuit around a fucking cucumber just leaned up against Gavin's step.
[07:51.600 --> 07:56.720]  I got detention. And I don't know what year that would have been, like, maybe grade four or grade five.
[07:56.740 --> 07:59.640]  Because my mom is, like, a special, like, lunch thing.
[08:00.180 --> 08:01.780]  Included some gifts in my lunch.
[08:01.860 --> 08:04.140]  One of them was the Pink Panther the movie book.
[08:04.600 --> 08:06.540]  And I don't remember if it was, like, details about the book.
[08:06.560 --> 08:08.340]  But there were photos from the movie in the book.
[08:08.440 --> 08:10.760]  And one of those photos was the wall thing.
[08:11.160 --> 08:13.080]  And I could not stop laughing.
[08:13.280 --> 08:16.300]  It's like, I couldn't- I was laughing so goddamn hard.
[08:16.400 --> 08:17.520]  And I couldn't put it away.
[08:17.600 --> 08:18.680]  I just kept every page.
[08:18.760 --> 08:19.540]  I flipped every photo.
[08:19.560 --> 08:20.380]  It would kill me more.
[08:20.380 --> 08:21.860]  I had this massive giggling fit.
[08:21.920 --> 08:22.440]  And I got detention.
[08:22.580 --> 08:24.020]  Because I was disrupting the class.
[08:24.140 --> 08:26.660]  Because I couldn't stop laughing at that specific image.
[08:26.660 --> 08:27.640]  I can't believe you got in trouble.
[08:27.860 --> 08:30.860]  You got detention at a movie you'd never seen before.
[08:31.120 --> 08:32.540]  I don't think I'd seen it yet.
[08:32.600 --> 08:35.320]  I either had seen it or it was coming out.
[08:35.400 --> 08:37.280]  And it was, like, a promotional book for it.
[08:37.560 --> 08:38.360]  But it was just-
[08:38.360 --> 08:40.380]  That's surely not better than the PSL's ones.
[08:41.120 --> 08:41.340]  No.
[08:41.340 --> 08:41.640]  No.
[08:42.700 --> 08:43.340]  Definitely not.
[08:43.460 --> 08:44.380]  Nobody said that.
[08:44.720 --> 08:45.740]  Okay. I'm just checking.
[08:45.860 --> 08:46.680]  I've never seen the new ones.
[08:47.560 --> 08:48.780]  I haven't seen them since they came out.
[08:49.420 --> 08:50.940]  You've unlocked a memory, Geoff.
[08:51.120 --> 08:53.700]  Of me in class, just laughing at that fucking book.
[08:54.360 --> 08:56.260]  Well, I'm glad to help.
[08:56.480 --> 08:58.260]  I'm trying to fucking post a picture.
[08:58.880 --> 08:59.720]  Eric, no, I didn't check.
[08:59.780 --> 09:00.420]  I'm gonna go check now.
[09:01.000 --> 09:01.700]  Is it too big, Geoff?
[09:01.760 --> 09:02.880]  Is that why you can't post the photo?
[09:03.420 --> 09:04.680]  No, I'm just an idiot.
[09:05.520 --> 09:06.680]  It's fucking tiny!
[09:07.220 --> 09:07.560]  Hold on.
[09:09.580 --> 09:10.540]  It's too small?
[09:10.620 --> 09:11.700]  That would be an interesting dilemma.
[09:13.080 --> 09:14.280]  What if there's a range?
[09:16.860 --> 09:20.640]  Is it related to our conversation, or is this setting up a new direction?
[09:22.300 --> 09:27.260]  No, it's just a picture of Jean-Blanc and Steve Martin in the bodysuit.
[09:27.620 --> 09:29.900]  Let me see if it's the exact photo they used in the...
[09:29.900 --> 09:32.380]  403 forbidden is what happens when I click that.
[09:32.600 --> 09:33.720]  Are you fucking serious?
[09:34.340 --> 09:35.080]  Works for me.
[09:35.960 --> 09:37.080]  Doesn't work for me.
[09:37.420 --> 09:39.620]  You got that secret Pink Panther access.
[09:39.800 --> 09:40.700]  I'm gonna recreate it.
[09:41.280 --> 09:41.520]  Yeah?
[09:41.840 --> 09:43.520]  I'd love to see you recreate that.
[09:43.520 --> 09:45.020]  I mean, take a screenshot.
[09:45.180 --> 09:47.640]  Although that is an idea I had I wanted to talk to you guys about.
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.340]  Which is us trying to seriously recreate iconic sports photos.
[09:52.740 --> 09:53.240]  Nothing there.
[09:54.560 --> 09:54.900]  Okay.
[09:55.560 --> 09:55.920]  Interesting.
[09:56.800 --> 09:57.480]  Here we go.
[09:58.120 --> 09:58.800]  Is that interesting?
[09:59.520 --> 10:01.520]  Yeah, it is. I can't believe you haven't found it.
[10:03.140 --> 10:05.220]  Oh, it's not the same photo, but that's a great one.
[10:05.460 --> 10:06.160]  That's just the one I found.
[10:06.700 --> 10:10.080]  Yeah, the one in the book was them literally hugging the wall.
[10:10.160 --> 10:11.680]  Yeah, I couldn't find that one for some reason.
[10:12.220 --> 10:13.340]  Jon Renau is great.
[10:13.660 --> 10:14.820]  What a fantastic actor.
[10:14.980 --> 10:15.520]  He's the best.
[10:15.680 --> 10:17.620]  He's fucking... talk about versatility.
[10:18.300 --> 10:18.740]  Yeah.
[10:19.360 --> 10:20.100]  Oh, he's incredible.
[10:20.220 --> 10:20.580]  I love him.
[10:20.620 --> 10:21.000]  Godzilla.
[10:21.780 --> 10:22.220]  Professional.
[10:22.960 --> 10:23.620]  Mission Impossible.
[10:24.400 --> 10:24.840]  Wasabi.
[10:25.340 --> 10:26.300]  It's a great action movie with him.
[10:26.620 --> 10:27.960]  The fucking Pink Panther movies.
[10:28.460 --> 10:29.660]  He's fucking amazing in.
[10:30.780 --> 10:31.220]  Leon.
[10:31.560 --> 10:33.100]  I guess he already said professional.
[10:33.100 --> 10:33.840]  Yeah, he did.
[10:34.720 --> 10:35.920]  I have a clip.
[10:36.160 --> 10:36.720]  Oh, you have a clip?
[10:36.820 --> 10:37.880]  Is it me saying trash?
[10:38.540 --> 10:38.800]  No.
[10:39.460 --> 10:39.940]  Oh, fuck.
[10:40.140 --> 10:40.740]  I just said it.
[10:40.740 --> 10:44.140]  Would you mind, go ahead and apologize for that one.
[10:44.320 --> 10:46.780]  And then, just while you're at it, apologize for last week too, please.
[10:48.100 --> 10:50.620]  Uh, apologize for last week outside of saying trash?
[10:51.100 --> 10:51.900]  Multiple times?
[10:52.080 --> 10:53.140]  Well, I definitely have said it two more times.
[10:53.140 --> 10:53.540]  You said it again.
[10:53.860 --> 10:54.120]  Here.
[10:54.300 --> 10:56.380]  Yeah, but I've already passed the limit.
[10:56.700 --> 10:58.580]  I guess I was saying trash can, right?
[10:59.080 --> 11:02.780]  Because I was frustrated with Gavin questioning my sneakiness.
[11:03.280 --> 11:05.540]  Oh, Gavin is live, which is terrifying.
[11:06.480 --> 11:09.340]  He was questioning my sneakiness, so I said I'd steal his trash cans.
[11:09.340 --> 11:11.360]  So I guess I have to do something now?
[11:11.580 --> 11:13.200]  I have to start the marathon?
[11:14.520 --> 11:16.580]  Okay, can you hear my audio?
[11:17.240 --> 11:17.680]  Let's see.
[11:18.600 --> 11:19.480]  When you're on my stream?
[11:20.160 --> 11:22.460]  Oh, no. Maybe. I don't hear anything yet.
[11:23.300 --> 11:24.260]  Are you playing audio?
[11:24.720 --> 11:26.620]  Let me just start playing. Let's see if you can hear this.
[11:27.040 --> 11:27.240]  Yep.
[11:27.460 --> 11:27.660]  Yeah.
[11:28.680 --> 11:29.240]  You got that?
[11:29.680 --> 11:30.580]  Yeah, I got it.
[11:30.940 --> 11:34.380]  Alright, here's my clip. It's about a minute and a half.
[11:35.600 --> 11:37.500]  Here we go. You ready? Everyone ready?
[11:37.540 --> 11:37.720]  Yeah.
[11:37.720 --> 11:38.140]  Yeah?
[11:38.580 --> 11:38.720]  Yep.
[11:39.040 --> 11:43.120]  I guess we all didn't realize what we were making when he pulled out all the mic equipment.
[11:43.560 --> 11:49.320]  What do you mean, we all didn't? Are you saying you didn't realize, and you're saying we all didn't realize?
[11:49.500 --> 11:52.360]  There was confusion when you brought out all the XLR cables and real mics.
[11:52.580 --> 11:55.380]  I think you were confused. Is that what you mean?
[11:55.760 --> 11:57.740]  There's no way Geoff wasn't also confused.
[11:58.140 --> 11:59.380]  Hi, welcome to F*** Face Cooks the Food.
[11:59.400 --> 12:01.780]  Hi, welcome to the supplementary episode of F*** Face.
[12:01.820 --> 12:03.660]  We've gotten together at Geoff's house to cook these pizzas.
[12:03.820 --> 12:05.340]  It's how you set the scene.
[12:05.340 --> 12:07.660]  But this is like 20 minutes into the pizza video, isn't it?
[12:07.740 --> 12:08.660]  Is this a separate thing?
[12:09.140 --> 12:12.180]  Are we not releasing audio of this?
[12:12.960 --> 12:14.140]  As an audio podcast?
[12:16.420 --> 12:17.960]  Are you for real?
[12:18.260 --> 12:19.960]  See, this is why he produces.
[12:20.620 --> 12:22.200]  It's an audio podcast!
[12:23.100 --> 12:27.820]  I mean, I remember there being a conversation about that equipment coming to the episode.
[12:28.120 --> 12:29.520]  I mean, I think we went over that at the time.
[12:29.620 --> 12:31.540]  Yeah, I thought we were really...
[12:31.540 --> 12:32.660]  That's fine. Doesn't matter.
[12:32.660 --> 12:35.240]  Gavin, Gavin, what can I do in the future?
[12:35.680 --> 12:37.720]  What can I do in the future to help you?
[12:38.040 --> 12:39.540]  Eric, this is not a you problem.
[12:39.820 --> 12:40.620]  This is a me problem.
[12:40.820 --> 12:43.400]  But I think it was also a Geoff problem briefly.
[12:44.320 --> 12:47.800]  Yeah, but if it was, I rolled with the punches very quickly.
[12:50.240 --> 12:52.760]  I like the way you posed this, where you went,
[12:53.080 --> 12:56.220]  Yeah, and then you brought out the equipment and we were all confused.
[13:03.700 --> 13:05.120]  That's a fantastic clip.
[13:05.720 --> 13:07.540]  That's a great clip. I don't need to listen to it again.
[13:07.980 --> 13:10.000]  No more, please. Once is enough.
[13:11.000 --> 13:12.340]  That's a great clip, Gavin.
[13:13.020 --> 13:14.860]  I mean, I was just vibing in the moment.
[13:16.840 --> 13:19.080]  Everybody starts to go, oh, you jump in, right?
[13:19.660 --> 13:21.520]  I'm trying to make you feel less uncomfortable,
[13:21.540 --> 13:23.340]  because I can see you're about to crash the plane.
[13:25.920 --> 13:28.920]  Or, it's entirely possible I'm just a lying hypocrite.
[13:29.040 --> 13:29.400]  I don't know.
[13:31.580 --> 13:32.460]  One of them is funnier.
[13:35.280 --> 13:38.020]  That is the other audio you were hearing there.
[13:38.140 --> 13:40.520]  If it hasn't come out yet, it's from our pizza video,
[13:42.460 --> 13:44.040]  which isn't out yet.
[13:44.700 --> 13:46.540]  No, I don't think the pizza video will be out.
[13:46.660 --> 13:49.220]  I think Nick is still in the process of editing that.
[13:49.280 --> 13:50.000]  Nick, is that correct?
[13:50.180 --> 13:52.340]  Yes, he's in the middle of editing that right now.
[13:53.480 --> 13:55.440]  I don't know if you know, it's hefty.
[13:55.580 --> 13:58.040]  Even with Emily stopping recording in the middle,
[13:58.040 --> 13:59.620]  it's still quite a bit.
[14:03.660 --> 14:06.120]  Emily pulled an action Bronson there, that was awesome.
[14:06.460 --> 14:08.940]  If there was any bit from that day to film,
[14:09.200 --> 14:11.900]  it was the bit that she stopped filming for.
[14:13.460 --> 14:17.940]  But I finished my cut of the process, the making of the pizza,
[14:18.080 --> 14:20.440]  that's on Google Drive, for Notes.
[14:21.100 --> 14:22.100]  Oh, great, that's awesome.
[14:23.260 --> 14:26.960]  I figured we would talk about this more in depth
[14:26.960 --> 14:29.300]  during Sausage Talk tomorrow, because I believe
[14:29.900 --> 14:30.900]  there's so much going on.
[14:31.040 --> 14:33.580]  We're doing Office Day tomorrow, it'll be our third Office Day,
[14:33.740 --> 14:36.020]  and we're going to record a Sausage Talk,
[14:36.120 --> 14:39.140]  and then we were talking about one or two pieces
[14:39.140 --> 14:40.780]  of supplemental content as well.
[14:41.220 --> 14:44.460]  Andrew, you wanted to do... well, just briefly.
[14:46.060 --> 14:47.840]  We wanted to do an end-of-the-year wrap-up
[14:47.840 --> 14:49.600]  where we talk about our favorite things from the year,
[14:49.720 --> 14:51.160]  which I thought was a bad idea,
[14:51.160 --> 14:53.940]  and I wasn't into until I started coming up with
[14:53.940 --> 14:56.000]  my favorite stuff of the year, and then I got quite into it.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.560]  You said there's nothing worth mentioning for this year
[15:00.560 --> 15:02.320]  as far as good things happening to you.
[15:02.440 --> 15:04.320]  On the year you got fucking engaged.
[15:04.600 --> 15:06.360]  You got engaged like two weeks ago.
[15:06.660 --> 15:09.280]  Listen, I got engaged. That was number one.
[15:09.520 --> 15:11.200]  Number two... we'll get into it tomorrow.
[15:11.480 --> 15:13.540]  There were good things about 2022,
[15:13.860 --> 15:17.360]  but it was largely a dogshit year for me.
[15:17.360 --> 15:20.940]  Not the least of which because two of my dogs died this year.
[15:22.200 --> 15:24.240]  When I say die, I realize how fucking...
[15:24.740 --> 15:26.660]  how on-the-nose that dogshit comment was.
[15:28.340 --> 15:31.320]  But then again, I haven't been covered in dogshit
[15:31.320 --> 15:33.320]  in 11 months, so...
[15:33.320 --> 15:36.620]  I guess that is kind of a nice side effect.
[15:38.120 --> 15:40.820]  Which is the first time I could say that in five years.
[15:41.280 --> 15:44.640]  Yeah, you had a significant bike crash as well this year.
[15:44.640 --> 15:47.560]  Oh, dude. I had the jock itch for six months.
[15:47.700 --> 15:49.800]  My daughter's surgery was so fucking...
[15:49.800 --> 15:52.900]  I had the fucking gum thing.
[15:53.520 --> 15:56.640]  I got COVID. I had three vacations canceled
[15:56.640 --> 15:59.060]  because of fucking illnesses and shit.
[15:59.240 --> 16:01.260]  It was like... it was just one thing after another.
[16:01.840 --> 16:05.900]  Dude, I got fucking two car crashes this year.
[16:08.740 --> 16:10.140]  It was never ending.
[16:11.040 --> 16:12.080]  Never fucking again.
[16:12.320 --> 16:16.240]  But anyway, we're going to cover the best of the year tomorrow.
[16:16.420 --> 16:18.980]  And then I think we're going to do this ladder tournament idea
[16:18.980 --> 16:21.380]  of funny clips that Andrew has that we're going to try.
[16:21.700 --> 16:22.720]  So we've got that coming tomorrow.
[16:23.220 --> 16:25.840]  I bring that up because in the last episode,
[16:26.020 --> 16:27.180]  I think there was some confusion.
[16:27.360 --> 16:31.340]  We thought maybe the monkey or pizza video would be out already.
[16:31.600 --> 16:34.140]  And the audience was wondering if they missed it or not.
[16:34.540 --> 16:35.400]  It's not the case.
[16:35.540 --> 16:39.140]  It's just the reality of having to record
[16:39.140 --> 16:41.520]  around holidays and vacations
[16:41.520 --> 16:43.500]  is that we have to batch record in advance.
[16:44.220 --> 16:46.200]  And when we do that, sometimes we miss the mark
[16:46.200 --> 16:47.480]  on when stuff's going to get edited.
[16:48.360 --> 16:50.500]  We were talking about two videos as if they were both out.
[16:50.620 --> 16:51.640]  As if they were both out.
[16:52.120 --> 16:56.100]  But that's also a side effect of us loving
[16:57.160 --> 16:59.820]  and prioritizing f***face to such a degree
[16:59.820 --> 17:01.040]  in the last few months
[17:01.040 --> 17:05.760]  that we have been knocking ancillary content out of the park.
[17:05.920 --> 17:07.680]  We've been filming stuff left and right,
[17:07.680 --> 17:11.040]  and there's still only one Nick.
[17:12.720 --> 17:17.180]  Obviously, Nick wanted to have a Thanksgiving as well.
[17:19.380 --> 17:21.380]  Stuff's just going to take a little longer to come out
[17:21.380 --> 17:24.720]  because we're creating more s***.
[17:25.100 --> 17:25.940]  And I don't think that's going to slow down.
[17:25.960 --> 17:30.600]  Who even knows how much stuff we'll schedule in March of 2023
[17:30.600 --> 17:32.300]  that won't be recorded until October?
[17:32.740 --> 17:34.520]  There could be so many things.
[17:34.720 --> 17:35.960]  That's an excellent point.
[17:35.960 --> 17:37.620]  Also, I should mention Kelly edits for us too.
[17:37.700 --> 17:38.640]  I don't want to leave Kelly out.
[17:40.680 --> 17:43.280]  Although Eric says Monkey Movie is out by the time this is out.
[17:43.280 --> 17:45.360]  Yes, we're recording on Thursday.
[17:45.540 --> 17:47.760]  Monkey Movie comes out tomorrow for first.
[17:47.940 --> 17:49.520]  But by the time this is out, Monkey Movie's out.
[17:49.620 --> 17:50.480]  So you can go check it out.
[17:51.000 --> 17:54.880]  You get two pieces of content staggered in release
[17:54.880 --> 17:56.660]  if that matters to you in some way.
[17:56.980 --> 18:00.480]  First, it will be Andrew's PowerPoint presentation
[18:00.480 --> 18:02.460]  complete with banana wipe.
[18:02.460 --> 18:05.800]  And then you'll get the watch-along of MVP 2.
[18:05.960 --> 18:10.880]  A movie that is about ice hockey and, apparently, skateboarding.
[18:11.380 --> 18:13.000]  So check them both out.
[18:13.080 --> 18:15.440]  They're out now on Rooster Teeth, wherever you get podcasts.
[18:15.680 --> 18:17.940]  But you should probably go on the YouTube because you can sync it up.
[18:18.220 --> 18:18.700]  Go on our YouTube channel.
[18:18.700 --> 18:22.400]  And then after that, as much as I thought it was going to be one video,
[18:22.500 --> 18:24.020]  we have two pizza videos coming up.
[18:24.480 --> 18:26.160]  Two pizza videos!
[18:27.420 --> 18:31.760]  Well, you just listed a list of terrible things that happened to you
[18:31.760 --> 18:34.920]  this year, Geoff. Can I make maybe a possibly late entry
[18:34.920 --> 18:37.440]  into a favorite thing of the year for you?
[18:37.560 --> 18:39.900]  Something I've been working on these last few days?
[18:40.180 --> 18:42.500]  Yeah, but is that something that we should do now?
[18:42.580 --> 18:44.480]  Or do we do it tomorrow in the episode?
[18:44.480 --> 18:45.720]  No, no, it'll be now.
[18:45.960 --> 18:49.560]  It needs to be placed now for you to consider it for tomorrow.
[18:49.640 --> 18:50.520]  I don't know if it'll make the list.
[18:50.700 --> 18:51.220]  Oh, I see.
[18:52.300 --> 18:54.880]  So I was curious because we're at the end of the year
[18:54.880 --> 18:57.520]  and one of my favorite bits of the year
[18:57.520 --> 18:59.600]  that the audience, that we really have to credit them
[18:59.600 --> 19:01.100]  as well as Gavin's inability to see,
[19:01.100 --> 19:04.660]  is anal passage becoming the number one selling shirt
[19:04.660 --> 19:06.820]  in the store, which is just absurd.
[19:07.000 --> 19:07.700]  It's hilarious to me.
[19:07.940 --> 19:10.560]  The concept that there would be meetings
[19:10.560 --> 19:13.660]  with professional people that are so far away from us
[19:13.660 --> 19:17.300]  that don't understand or have any context for f***face,
[19:17.480 --> 19:21.080]  having to look at charts where f***face anal passage
[19:21.080 --> 19:23.480]  is number one, you can't ignore it.
[19:23.720 --> 19:25.980]  It has to be there. Just kills me.
[19:26.120 --> 19:27.340]  It makes me laugh so... it's great.
[19:27.480 --> 19:30.260]  It's genuinely one of my favorite things of the year.
[19:30.260 --> 19:33.660]  And so I was curious, because I hadn't checked in in a while,
[19:34.080 --> 19:35.960]  so I reached out to the merch department
[19:35.960 --> 19:37.960]  to make sure that we were still number one,
[19:38.380 --> 19:40.860]  and sadly we have fallen to number two.
[19:41.260 --> 19:43.920]  It is the number two selling shirt by a little bit.
[19:43.980 --> 19:48.080]  So I've been trying to reignite the anal passage brand
[19:48.080 --> 19:50.980]  to kind of close out the year and hopefully get us back
[19:50.980 --> 19:52.440]  on top of that anal passage pyramid.
[19:52.700 --> 19:54.800]  So I did some research, I did some digging.
[19:54.800 --> 19:55.940]  You keep climbing that anal mountain.
[19:56.500 --> 19:59.840]  I climbed that anal mountain and I made something
[19:59.840 --> 20:02.520]  that's the first step in bringing the brand back
[20:02.520 --> 20:05.100]  to the top of anal mountain, where it deserves to be.
[20:05.160 --> 20:08.800]  Geoff, let me introduce you to analpassage.com
[20:08.800 --> 20:13.760]  A new website for a serious brand for serious people.
[20:15.500 --> 20:17.420]  Oh my good god.
[20:17.660 --> 20:19.540]  He looks like a serial killer.
[20:22.900 --> 20:24.020]  10 passages?
[20:24.720 --> 20:26.720]  So yeah, so we've done a few things on this site.
[20:27.040 --> 20:29.540]  As you can see, open it, wonderful Jack's face on it.
[20:29.540 --> 20:30.480]  Welcome to anal passage.
[20:30.560 --> 20:32.380]  It's available, obviously, to anyone listening.
[20:32.520 --> 20:33.680]  You can go on analpassage.com.
[20:33.880 --> 20:36.860]  We got the home, we got the FAQ, we got the top 10 passages.
[20:37.020 --> 20:38.180]  We got more. Where are you at, Gavin?
[20:38.220 --> 20:39.280]  You're at the top 10 passages?
[20:39.340 --> 20:40.240]  What about the top 10 passages?
[20:40.800 --> 20:42.740]  There's 10 famous passages.
[20:42.780 --> 20:44.300]  Let's open up the top 10 passages.
[20:44.720 --> 20:46.100]  I don't think there's any dispute for what these are.
[20:46.100 --> 20:50.940]  Such as Brooklyn Bridge in Brooklyn and Rainbow Bridge in Asgard.
[20:52.080 --> 20:53.520]  Kevin McAllister's Zipline.
[20:53.920 --> 20:57.940]  Kevin McAllister's Zipline is maybe my favorite passage of all time.
[20:58.380 --> 20:58.580]  Where'd you get that from?
[20:58.580 --> 21:00.640]  What do you mean? The zipline?
[21:01.220 --> 21:03.540]  Yeah, what made you put that on there?
[21:03.620 --> 21:06.720]  Well, it's just when I was thinking of defining what a passage is.
[21:06.780 --> 21:10.000]  It's essentially like a path over or around or through something.
[21:10.480 --> 21:13.960]  And the zipline, as a kid, I thought that was so fucking cool.
[21:14.280 --> 21:16.540]  To have a zipline from your bedroom to the treehouse.
[21:16.740 --> 21:17.500]  It's amazing.
[21:18.120 --> 21:21.100]  You're overlooking number one, which is hole six at the Paradise Swamp Park,
[21:21.180 --> 21:23.680]  which is a mini golf course on the island.
[21:24.080 --> 21:25.860]  You walk on a pirate ship. It's very cool.
[21:25.980 --> 21:26.720]  On your island?
[21:27.040 --> 21:27.820]  Yeah, on our island.
[21:27.820 --> 21:29.820]  Oh, we gotta play mini golf on your island!
[21:30.540 --> 21:33.060]  You can see Paradise Swamp Park.
[21:33.640 --> 21:35.340]  It's not, it's honestly, it's okay.
[21:35.920 --> 21:41.360]  We can potentially bring a load of anal passage shirts to the number one top ten passage in the world.
[21:41.560 --> 21:42.280]  We've got to!
[21:42.800 --> 21:44.640]  We can have a little sell off at the end of the year.
[21:44.780 --> 21:45.900]  We'll do it when we go crabbing.
[21:46.360 --> 21:50.120]  So I guess for the audio listeners, just go through hole six, Paradise Swamp Park is number one,
[21:50.240 --> 21:53.700]  followed by Brooklyn Bridge two, Rainbow Bridge three is Asgard.
[21:54.120 --> 21:56.120]  Number four is Kevin McAllister's Zipline.
[21:56.120 --> 21:57.820]  Number five, Golden Gate Bridge.
[21:58.220 --> 22:03.320]  Number six, Hawaii Door, which is a door in Monsters, Inc. with a time code of where you can find it.
[22:03.700 --> 22:06.740]  Number seven is the path to becoming John Malkovich.
[22:07.160 --> 22:11.700]  Number eight, the Staples Center secret entrance, which I don't know if you're familiar with, Gavin,
[22:12.060 --> 22:17.740]  but there's a player who played for that team, got traded, got into, they had like a fight on the court,
[22:17.900 --> 22:23.200]  and the guy that got traded that used to play there led a group of players through a secret entrance
[22:23.200 --> 22:26.560]  in the bowels of the arena to try to attack the other team in the locker room.
[22:26.880 --> 22:27.440]  It's fantastic.
[22:27.700 --> 22:32.500]  By the way, this player who he's mentioning is State Farm's own Chris Paul.
[22:34.040 --> 22:38.740]  Number nine is the Shawshank Tunnels and the Mines of Moray, Middle Earth.
[22:39.100 --> 22:40.280]  Number ten, so that's our top ten.
[22:42.060 --> 22:46.980]  The Golden Gate Bridge ranks above a tunnel leading to the brain of another human.
[22:47.700 --> 22:49.540]  Yeah, it's a great bridge. I don't know if you've seen it.
[22:49.540 --> 22:50.580]  It's a really nice bridge.
[22:50.760 --> 22:51.720]  It looks really nice.
[22:51.800 --> 22:52.220]  It is a really, really nice bridge.
[22:52.220 --> 22:55.400]  In so many movies, it always pops when it's in a movie. It's fantastic.
[22:55.520 --> 22:57.440]  That color, international orange, lovely.
[22:57.740 --> 22:59.340]  So where should we move to next?
[22:59.500 --> 23:01.260]  I guess more future innovations?
[23:01.800 --> 23:05.700]  Okay, so future innovations is, because if we're a serious brand, we can't just stop at a shirt.
[23:06.000 --> 23:06.660]  Oh, Lord.
[23:07.060 --> 23:13.620]  So I reached out to Tony, who's fantastic in merch, and I ran some ideas by him and had him make some things.
[23:14.140 --> 23:15.900]  You've had people put time on this.
[23:16.360 --> 23:20.760]  Tony is incredible. Some of the products here are fantastic. We could go through.
[23:20.760 --> 23:26.720]  The first one, anal baggage. It's a bag. It's being currently used to cover a jet ski.
[23:28.200 --> 23:30.780]  You could use it however you want. We all have anal baggage.
[23:31.660 --> 23:33.920]  There's the toy. I don't remember what those are called.
[23:34.140 --> 23:35.140]  What's on the viewfinder?
[23:35.680 --> 23:37.820]  Yeah, I don't know. We could finalize that.
[23:40.060 --> 23:42.760]  We've got the anal passage age-appropriate toy.
[23:43.220 --> 23:48.000]  We've got the anal passage of time, which is a clock anybody can use.
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.580]  We've got to sell that!
[23:50.380 --> 23:51.780]  We've got to sell that!
[23:53.800 --> 23:56.400]  Can we please sell it? A passage of time clock?
[23:57.100 --> 23:59.040]  We've got like 21 items here.
[23:59.260 --> 24:00.760]  I want to make one so I can have it.
[24:01.220 --> 24:06.060]  Yeah. Oh, we have the anal passage of enlightenment, which is a great pet toy. You can crawl through there, have fun.
[24:06.680 --> 24:11.560]  Create your own anal passages. Some might just call it a journal, but I think you can create your own.
[24:12.420 --> 24:18.180]  Anal pass in fruit is a beverage flavor. We have a possible sparkling water beverage.
[24:18.560 --> 24:19.920]  Anal passion fruit.
[24:21.540 --> 24:26.260]  Using your vernacular, Gavin, we've got some running shoes that were called trainers.
[24:26.480 --> 24:27.500]  We've got anal trainers.
[24:28.120 --> 24:31.460]  If you need a hat to block out the sun, we have anal cappage.
[24:32.980 --> 24:35.540]  We have a pillow if you need to sleep. Anal passage.
[24:36.220 --> 24:38.060]  Some Zs because you're falling asleep.
[24:39.600 --> 24:46.480]  We have a baseball, so that'd be anal smasage, because there's no better thing to hit fingers with than the anal smasage.
[24:51.160 --> 24:59.880]  We've got an anal passage measure, because it's very important to have the specifics of the size of the passage you're dealing with.
[25:00.300 --> 25:03.100]  Then we just have the lazily named anal passage bomber jacket.
[25:03.200 --> 25:05.260]  I couldn't think of a funny name. I just thought it looked fucking awesome.
[25:05.560 --> 25:06.320]  I thought that looked great.
[25:07.340 --> 25:14.720]  Closing out our lineup is Anal Issues Past the Tissues, a Kleenex box sponsored by Anal Passage.
[25:16.520 --> 25:20.800]  So your theory is if we sell some of this stuff, we'll become the number one item of the year?
[25:21.160 --> 25:26.220]  No, we also have to join the team. If you click, it'll go to a link of buying the shirt in the store.
[25:26.520 --> 25:27.480]  I should also mention...
[25:27.980 --> 25:29.940]  I didn't realize we were still selling this thing.
[25:30.300 --> 25:33.420]  The shirt is still available. I'm working on a testimonial video.
[25:33.420 --> 25:42.060]  So if anyone wants to send a testimonial video to me of them wearing the shirt talking about how it has changed your life becoming an anal passer,
[25:42.620 --> 25:45.560]  email me at andrew at anal passage dot com.
[25:45.700 --> 25:49.580]  That is a totally real email, and I am working on getting a video together.
[25:50.320 --> 25:51.920]  So please feel free to send a submission.
[25:52.440 --> 25:56.480]  I see you're also looking for the perfect fit for a celebrity endorsement.
[25:56.920 --> 25:57.940]  I am, yeah.
[25:57.940 --> 26:04.020]  So I remembered a long, long time ago, Macaulay Culkin wore a rooster teeth shirt.
[26:04.120 --> 26:07.340]  So I tweeted to him, didn't get a response. So we're still working.
[26:07.900 --> 26:10.200]  We're still out there. We're trying to figure it out.
[26:10.380 --> 26:12.740]  I didn't think you could get Macaulay Culkin to wear an anal passage shirt.
[26:12.800 --> 26:14.900]  Well, he wore a Captain Dynamic shirt.
[26:15.220 --> 26:18.240]  He's really rebounded since that point, I think.
[26:18.960 --> 26:21.100]  Oh, you think that that was a low that he's out of now?
[26:25.200 --> 26:27.920]  I think he's in a better place.
[26:27.920 --> 26:30.620]  I've just glanced the frequently asked questions. There's only three.
[26:31.060 --> 26:34.880]  First question, why? Because a serious brand deserves a serious website.
[26:35.140 --> 26:36.560]  Second question, what is anal passage?
[26:37.140 --> 26:38.460]  Anal passage is a way of life.
[26:38.800 --> 26:40.820]  Three, do you even like theme parks?
[26:41.200 --> 26:42.680]  I don't understand this question.
[26:43.220 --> 26:44.300]  I thought it was odd to ask.
[26:45.140 --> 26:46.480]  But you asked it of yourself.
[26:47.120 --> 26:49.540]  Well, you know, listen, so I've heard questions about it.
[26:49.720 --> 26:51.580]  I'm just responding to the questions that people have.
[26:52.740 --> 26:55.340]  So that is the anal passage submission. I hope you enjoyed it.
[26:55.340 --> 26:58.720]  I hope it is in consideration, maybe one of your favorite things of the year.
[26:59.240 --> 27:00.440]  I hope the audience enjoyed it.
[27:00.440 --> 27:04.140]  I'm blown away at how actually good some of those fake products look.
[27:04.460 --> 27:05.740]  Yeah, they look great.
[27:05.920 --> 27:06.520]  That baseball.
[27:07.000 --> 27:12.160]  Honestly, the Jet Ski cover is not bad either.
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.520]  It's just, it's such a, what I like about that is it's such a niche product.
[27:16.880 --> 27:23.180]  The concept of a Jet Ski cover, like nobody, I would bet less than three people that listen to this have a Jet Ski.
[27:23.920 --> 27:31.160]  Hey, if you listen to F*** Face and you own a Jet Ski, can you email Andrew at analpassage.com and let him know?
[27:31.440 --> 27:36.880]  I'd love to get a, I'd love to get a tally going of how many Jet Ski owners we have in the fray.
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.660]  As a Jet Ski enthusiast myself and aficionado, I'd love to connect with others out there.
[27:41.980 --> 27:43.840]  Just out of curiosity. That's all.
[27:44.620 --> 27:50.260]  Do we know how many times the anal passage shirt outsold the annual pass shirt?
[27:50.680 --> 27:51.480]  Is that a stat that we know?
[27:51.960 --> 27:52.700]  I do not.
[27:53.160 --> 27:54.820]  Cause that's probably a win in itself.
[27:55.720 --> 28:02.200]  Oh my God. Do you know how many Jet Skiing participants there were in the United States in 2017?
[28:02.500 --> 28:05.840]  That's the most recent they have data for. 5.2 million.
[28:07.140 --> 28:08.180]  Wow. Bigger than I thought.
[28:08.220 --> 28:09.460]  That's more than I would have anticipated. Yeah.
[28:09.500 --> 28:10.300]  That's a big number.
[28:10.780 --> 28:12.360]  What do you throw at us?
[28:13.520 --> 28:14.860]  One of the Uno shirts.
[28:15.040 --> 28:15.640]  Yeah, it was Uno.
[28:15.680 --> 28:16.700]  During the age of Uno.
[28:17.940 --> 28:18.300]  Bummer.
[28:18.300 --> 28:19.800]  Yeah, it is a bummer.
[28:19.860 --> 28:25.420]  But I hope, I'm hoping, if you buy the shirt because of this and you want to be in the testimonial,
[28:25.480 --> 28:29.120]  I'm going to wait a little bit before putting that together so you will have time to submit a video if you want to.
[28:29.640 --> 28:32.040]  The shirt is available in extra medium, of course.
[28:33.360 --> 28:40.200]  Is it, are we within striking distance? How tall is Anal Mountain?
[28:40.340 --> 28:44.240]  Listen, Anal Mountain is pretty tall. There's a little bit of a gap.
[28:44.240 --> 28:50.480]  I would be, it would be even more ridiculous if we were able to pass that point.
[28:50.540 --> 28:52.220]  But I want to get as close as possible.
[28:52.520 --> 28:54.620]  And I want to at least solidify us in the top three.
[28:55.220 --> 28:56.760]  Because we're a little close to the three.
[28:56.860 --> 28:58.640]  So as long as, top three, I'm happy with.
[28:58.700 --> 29:01.940]  But if we could reclaim number one, that'd be fucking ridiculous.
[29:02.340 --> 29:08.320]  I will say, as an emerging brand, we had a lot of anal heat earlier in the year when we launched that thing.
[29:08.360 --> 29:12.800]  And we really did kind of just let it die on the vine as the year went on.
[29:12.800 --> 29:15.920]  You gotta feed the beast.
[29:16.900 --> 29:20.580]  The thing with it was, we didn't expect it to exist for long.
[29:20.680 --> 29:24.820]  It was supposed to be kind of a throwaway joke that once Jack noticed, we'd remove.
[29:25.080 --> 29:28.460]  But then it became so big that we couldn't remove it.
[29:28.600 --> 29:30.380]  It was just such a great shirt.
[29:30.820 --> 29:34.340]  That's right, he wanted us to take it down, but it was the number one selling item.
[29:34.340 --> 29:37.660]  It was the number one, so how do you take down the number one selling shirt?
[29:38.000 --> 29:38.760]  That's funny.
[29:39.240 --> 29:41.240]  It suddenly started paying salaries.
[29:45.040 --> 29:47.240]  So that is analpassage.com.
[29:47.360 --> 29:48.060]  That is magic.
[29:48.500 --> 29:50.180]  You're a treat, man.
[29:50.420 --> 29:52.080]  That's the best site you've made so far.
[29:52.900 --> 29:54.420]  I think so. It's up there.
[29:54.540 --> 29:58.440]  I owe a lot to Tony and my friends as well with helping me coming up with product names.
[29:58.720 --> 29:59.400]  That's fantastic.
[30:01.400 --> 30:03.480]  How long did Tony spend on that?
[30:04.480 --> 30:05.840]  Shockingly, not long.
[30:06.460 --> 30:12.380]  I messaged Tony, it was probably like 11.30 when I messaged him.
[30:12.600 --> 30:13.820]  I was like, hey, this is ridiculous.
[30:14.340 --> 30:16.720]  If you don't want to do this or you're too busy, totally understand.
[30:17.200 --> 30:18.140]  I have these ideas.
[30:18.320 --> 30:25.240]  I suggested the Anal Passage of Time, the Anal Tunnel of Enlightenment, and the Create Your Own Anal Passages.
[30:26.180 --> 30:28.380]  I was like, could you maybe put some branding on these?
[30:29.100 --> 30:31.260]  He's like, yeah, I'll get around to it and I'll send it to you tomorrow.
[30:31.260 --> 30:33.860]  I was like, oh, that's perfect, I'll have time for the show, it'll be ready.
[30:34.440 --> 30:38.460]  I woke up and he had sent me 10 or 11 things immediately.
[30:38.920 --> 30:41.520]  By like 8am the next day, he was on top of it.
[30:41.560 --> 30:45.000]  So I have no idea how long it took him, but he just sent so many things.
[30:45.260 --> 30:45.780]  He killed it.
[30:47.020 --> 30:48.440]  One of my favorite parts of the site.
[30:48.940 --> 30:50.860]  Tony's a fucking talented dude.
[30:51.200 --> 30:53.000]  Incredibly talented. So funny.
[30:58.980 --> 31:02.280]  This episode is brought to you by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery.
[31:02.280 --> 31:08.260]  The Grateful Dead and Dogfish Head have gotten the band back together with the release of Grateful Dead Juicy Pale Ale.

[31:33.480 --> 31:35.020]  You say, I have no space.
[31:35.380 --> 31:37.220]  You say, eh, I'm just looking.
[31:37.620 --> 31:38.720]  Then you click.
[31:39.240 --> 31:42.500]  Then you zoom in on photo number 87 and whisper, oh no.
[31:42.940 --> 31:45.480]  Then you text a friend, the one who always enables you.
[31:45.800 --> 31:50.540]  You say to yourself, this is the last one, knowing it is not.
[31:51.040 --> 31:52.180]  You don't need this car.
[31:52.600 --> 31:56.140]  But maybe, just maybe, this car needs you.
[31:56.520 --> 31:58.520]  Bring a trailer. It's never just a car.
[31:58.520 --> 32:06.520]  Buenos dias! Cafe Bustelo Espresso styled iced coffee is hitting refrigerators with a cold front that'll sweep through your senses.
[32:06.800 --> 32:10.160]  So keep the coffee pours long and the cold sips low.
[32:10.740 --> 32:12.160]  Cafe Bustelo está aquí.
[32:13.360 --> 32:16.600]  Imagine you're walking down the street and a bird poops all over your arm.
[32:16.740 --> 32:18.700]  Are you just going to pat it off with a dry napkin?
[32:19.080 --> 32:21.020]  No! You'd wash it off with water.
[32:21.360 --> 32:23.760]  So why are we treating our buttholes any differently?
[32:23.760 --> 32:30.040]  Stop smearing your business around with toilet paper and start washing with water with the Hello Tushy bidet.
[32:30.720 --> 32:36.200]  Hello Tushy bidet is a fantastic product. It was so easy to install. It elevated my bathroom in every way.
[32:36.740 --> 32:39.400]  So stop spreading your business around your butthole with toilet paper.
[32:39.880 --> 32:41.840]  Start washing with Hello Tushy bidets.
[32:42.100 --> 32:47.800]  The Hello Tushy bidet attachment washes your bum with fresh water for a way better clean than toilet paper.
[32:47.800 --> 32:53.100]  Simply spray and pat dry. It attaches to your existing toilet. No electrician or plumber needed.

[33:32.780 --> 33:38.640]  I don't own a dog. I just have a 20 year old cat that Gavin still probably isn't aware exists.
[33:38.840 --> 33:44.400]  But using the internet without ExpressVPN is like walking your dog in public without securing them on a leash.
[33:44.400 --> 33:50.000]  Most of the time you'll probably be fine, but what if one day your dog runs away or gets dognapped?
[33:50.460 --> 33:54.300]  It's better to be careful, especially when it's as simple as using ExpressVPN.
[33:55.160 --> 34:01.180]  Every time you connect to an unencrypted network in cafes, hotels, airports, etc. your online data is not secured.
[34:01.800 --> 34:06.120]  Any hacker on the same network can gain access to and steal your personal data.
[34:06.680 --> 34:12.520]  But ExpressVPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet so they can't.
[34:12.520 --> 34:17.720]  It'd take a hacker with a supercomputer over a billion years to get past ExpressVPN's encryption.
[34:18.580 --> 34:23.440]  ExpressVPN works on all your devices, phones, laptops, tablets, even on your smart TV.
[34:23.920 --> 34:28.300]  And it's so easy to use. Just fire up the app and click one button to get protected.
[34:28.840 --> 34:34.340]  I like using ExpressVPN to access content libraries in other countries. It's fantastic, as I said before.
[34:34.800 --> 34:41.560]  It allowed me to watch the Scripps Smelling Bee, which is a big part of my yearly activities. I love it. It's one of my favorite events.
[34:41.560 --> 34:53.160]  Get an extra 3 months of ExpressVPN free at expressvpn.com. That's expressvpn.com. That's expressvpn.com.

[36:20.720 --> 36:25.320]  So I have one other small thing, but I don't know if you guys want to talk about other things before I...
[36:25.320 --> 36:27.340]  No, not at all. Just dive right into it.
[36:27.340 --> 36:29.320]  Yeah, I got a follow-up thing I want to go after.
[36:29.980 --> 36:36.120]  Okay, well, this is... it involves you, Gavin, because we've had, you know, rivalry sort of recently with things in the past.
[36:36.360 --> 36:44.120]  You're going back and forth. You all might remember that Cosmic Crisp was kind enough to follow Geoff and I.
[36:44.540 --> 36:48.140]  And I believe the podcast account as well. A long time ago, like in the summer.
[36:48.500 --> 36:54.560]  And we had a dialogue back and forth with them, and they're like, oh, so, you know, that's great that you've given us support.
[36:54.560 --> 36:58.620]  I'd love to listen to it and show the team the podcast.
[36:58.940 --> 37:05.740]  So I sent the episode of me reviewing the Cosmic Crisp, because I didn't send the Cosmic Crisp review.
[37:06.180 --> 37:12.620]  To be honest, you're kind of shitty about it, Gavin. You're pretty low on the Cosmic Crisp, which I think is a ridiculous rating to give.
[37:12.640 --> 37:13.740]  No, I was low on apples.
[37:14.440 --> 37:18.380]  Yeah, but that's, you know, it's part of the family. I just think that's an insane take, personally.
[37:18.820 --> 37:23.080]  So I sent instead my review, which I haven't listened to, but I assume is a lot more favorable.
[37:23.080 --> 37:30.640]  However, in that review, I ate a pink lady first, thinking it was a Cosmic Crisp, then realized my mistake, then reviewed the Cosmic Crisp.
[37:31.080 --> 37:36.680]  So it's like, plus the name of our show, they seem like a very wholesome brand. I wasn't sure how that would go.
[37:36.760 --> 37:41.420]  So I sent them the podcast. They said, great. Thank you so much. I'll get back to you next week.
[37:41.420 --> 37:52.780]  That was August 11th. They never commented back, but a few days ago, I got another DM from them, and I'm so excited.
[37:53.420 --> 37:59.440]  I'm going to post it right now, and then I'll read it out loud in our chat. This is what I received from Cosmic Crisp.
[38:00.240 --> 38:06.360]  Hi, Andrew and Geoff, excluding Gavin. Gavin is not mentioned. We hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving.
[38:07.540 --> 38:14.900]  Our team loved your episode. As a token of our appreciation for all of your support, we wanted to send you a little care package.
[38:15.300 --> 38:18.820]  Would you be able to send us your shipping information, mailing address, phone number, and email?
[38:19.260 --> 38:23.920]  Wishing you a wonderful week. I don't know if they want their name mentioned, but the Cosmic Crisp social team.
[38:24.100 --> 38:27.300]  They reached out to us. Geoff, we're going to get a gift basket.
[38:27.300 --> 38:30.340]  Andrew, congratulations. All your hard work is paying off.
[38:31.020 --> 38:37.600]  Congratulations to you for understanding what a good apple is, and respecting the apple the way it deserves to be respected.
[38:37.620 --> 38:39.200]  Hey, hold on a second. Gavin, we're talking.
[38:42.300 --> 38:47.940]  I'm glad you brought that up, Andrew, because I think respect is earned.
[38:48.460 --> 38:56.400]  And I hope that I have earned the respect of the Cosmic Crisp social team, as well as I think you clearly have.
[38:56.400 --> 39:05.120]  And now that we have that respect, I hope we wield it appropriately and know that we have respect.
[39:05.560 --> 39:08.100]  The respect that they shine at us shines right back at them.
[39:10.060 --> 39:17.280]  I believe Gavin called it a bog-standard apple. It would be really funny if they sent him a bog-standard care package.
[39:18.240 --> 39:20.340]  Just a mediocre, not great thing.
[39:20.860 --> 39:25.020]  I love that you weren't included, and I think that's deliberate, because you didn't respect the apple.
[39:25.020 --> 39:26.480]  That's what happens.
[39:26.740 --> 39:28.520]  I feel like I didn't shit on the apple.
[39:29.520 --> 39:33.780]  Yeah, you weren't a fan of it. You and Eric both were pretty down on the apple experience.
[39:34.540 --> 39:41.240]  Hmm. I can understand them following just YouTube, because I don't really use socials.
[39:41.900 --> 39:44.840]  But then they listened to it and still didn't address me by name.
[39:45.400 --> 39:47.720]  Yeah. They loved it.
[39:48.980 --> 39:51.360]  They at least loved two-thirds of it.
[39:51.360 --> 39:51.820]  That's upsetting.
[39:52.960 --> 39:55.780]  It was a good apple. I mean, it was fine. It was...
[39:55.780 --> 39:57.180]  I can't even dig...
[39:57.180 --> 40:01.280]  You know what? Listen, I just went through... Gavin, I went through redemption year.
[40:01.460 --> 40:04.860]  You can have your own redemption year. You can try to make things right with the Cosmic Crisp people.
[40:05.800 --> 40:07.640]  I can't, uh...
[40:07.640 --> 40:08.360]  Be bothered?
[40:08.480 --> 40:09.540]  You can't fake an opinion.
[40:10.180 --> 40:10.720]  No, you can't.
[40:11.500 --> 40:14.320]  But can I ask you, like, in complete seriousness, have you found it yet?
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.760]  Did you... do you find that... you looked?
[40:18.180 --> 40:20.120]  It's gonna be a long couple of recordings, isn't it, this one?
[40:21.860 --> 40:23.960]  Hey, let me ask you guys a question.
[40:25.300 --> 40:27.860]  Andrew, did you find Monopoly money on your front door yet?
[40:28.400 --> 40:30.140]  No. It hasn't been placed.
[40:30.560 --> 40:32.320]  I've been vigilant. I'm gonna be honest.
[40:32.820 --> 40:33.920]  I bought a paintball gun.
[40:38.380 --> 40:41.220]  But I bought a paintball gun...
[40:41.220 --> 40:43.660]  You just stood God on your door?
[40:44.140 --> 40:46.200]  No, no, no. This is what happened. Let me finish the story.
[40:46.200 --> 40:51.900]  I bought a paintball gun because I have a balcony, and it overlooks, like, the entire walkway to the door.
[40:52.260 --> 40:55.960]  And I thought, if I see you, I could fire down upon you.
[40:56.300 --> 40:59.660]  Instead of having to run and chase after you, I'd just fire at you from the balcony.
[41:00.020 --> 41:06.760]  I then had guilt upon taking it home that I'd be shooting paintballs at you, and I returned the paintball gun.
[41:06.840 --> 41:09.860]  Because I felt bad about the possibility of pelting you with paintball.
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.760]  So I no longer have a paintball gun.
[41:12.080 --> 41:14.620]  My point was just, I am prepared for this to happen.
[41:14.620 --> 41:16.360]  I've put things in place.
[41:16.580 --> 41:22.540]  I've maybe done some other Home Alone-like hijinks to booby-trap the area, waiting for your arrival.
[41:22.960 --> 41:23.680]  But I'm prepared.
[41:25.060 --> 41:26.200]  You're not gonna see me.
[41:27.080 --> 41:27.880]  I'm not gonna see you?
[41:28.580 --> 41:30.960]  I don't think that's possible. I got a camera set up.
[41:31.440 --> 41:33.200]  I got multiple cameras, multiple angles.
[41:34.260 --> 41:35.720]  Unless you, like, parachute in.
[41:35.880 --> 41:37.180]  Which, hey, you win.
[41:37.420 --> 41:39.740]  If you parachute in, I'll give it to you.
[41:42.780 --> 41:43.140]  Hmm.
[41:43.540 --> 41:45.480]  How long do I have to do this? What did we say?
[41:45.840 --> 41:48.280]  You said the end of December. If you want, I'm willing to extend it.
[41:48.460 --> 41:49.460]  You wanna push it back a little bit?
[41:50.040 --> 41:50.940]  I'm okay with that.
[41:51.380 --> 41:55.020]  Do I have to take the ferry? There's surely quicker ways to that island.
[41:55.220 --> 41:55.800]  Can I fly there?
[41:56.040 --> 41:58.360]  You could fly there. There's multiple ways you could fly.
[41:58.700 --> 41:59.380]  I prefer the ferry.
[41:59.820 --> 42:01.520]  Why don't you just fly?
[42:02.020 --> 42:03.680]  Because I prefer the ferry experience.
[42:04.400 --> 42:06.240]  I've never used the airport we have.
[42:06.620 --> 42:08.600]  There's also a seaplane you could use.
[42:08.600 --> 42:09.980]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[42:10.920 --> 42:12.240]  Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[42:12.740 --> 42:14.340]  I don't mean to interrupt here.
[42:15.040 --> 42:16.200]  What the fuck?
[42:16.660 --> 42:18.800]  I thought the only way to get to where you are was
[42:18.800 --> 42:21.340]  we had to fly somewhere, go somewhere, take a ferry.
[42:21.860 --> 42:23.260]  No, he's been clear.
[42:23.340 --> 42:25.380]  We can fly directly to where you are?
[42:25.760 --> 42:27.860]  Yeah, he's been clear about this in the past.
[42:27.980 --> 42:30.760]  He prefers the bigger airport or some shit.
[42:31.280 --> 42:32.400]  Yeah, I prefer the ferry experience.
[42:33.380 --> 42:34.460]  There's a seaplane as well.
[42:34.960 --> 42:37.080]  It's actually probably the most convenient way to get here
[42:37.080 --> 42:39.620]  would be going from the airport to the seaplane.
[42:39.760 --> 42:40.840]  Which is pretty close.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.500]  The Vancouver airport to the seaplane.
[42:42.960 --> 42:44.680]  Then flying across. It's a beautiful view.
[42:45.540 --> 42:46.540]  I just prefer the boat.
[42:46.880 --> 42:50.000]  How many hours does the boat add to your journey?
[42:50.400 --> 42:54.560]  So the seaplane I think is like a 25-30 minute flight across.
[42:54.940 --> 42:56.080]  The boat is like...
[42:57.020 --> 42:57.920]  2 hours maybe?
[42:58.240 --> 43:00.200]  This is unreal.
[43:00.540 --> 43:05.080]  I thought that the ferry was such an obstacle for us to overcome
[43:05.080 --> 43:10.260]  and then I'm finding out that we can just get a plane like any other fucking place in the world.
[43:10.320 --> 43:11.400]  Are you serious?
[43:11.820 --> 43:12.720]  Is this for real?
[43:13.220 --> 43:13.860]  I'm furious.
[43:15.300 --> 43:16.940]  I'm furious right now.
[43:17.300 --> 43:20.000]  You should be happy to learn that there's a seaplane
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.700]  because it is a beautiful sight to fly into that harbor.
[43:22.780 --> 43:23.340]  This sucks.
[43:24.960 --> 43:26.380]  I'd be ecstatic if I were you.
[43:27.040 --> 43:28.580]  So you take off from the water?
[43:29.360 --> 43:29.720]  Yeah.
[43:30.360 --> 43:32.100]  It lands in the water.
[43:32.440 --> 43:33.580]  It flies from the water.
[43:33.580 --> 43:36.960]  And that's from the airport?
[43:37.960 --> 43:39.260]  So you go from the airport
[43:39.260 --> 43:41.760]  and then you go to the seaplane location.
[43:41.900 --> 43:43.420]  It's probably like a 15-20 minute cap drive.
[43:43.440 --> 43:45.240]  I'm just imagining a normal airport
[43:45.240 --> 43:46.880]  but one of the gates is in the water.
[43:48.220 --> 43:48.900]  I wish.
[43:49.000 --> 43:50.840]  No, it's on a dock.
[43:51.000 --> 43:51.740]  It's a small little thing.
[43:51.800 --> 43:52.760]  I haven't been in a long time.
[43:53.020 --> 43:55.320]  It could be different but it's not that big of an area.
[43:55.480 --> 43:56.340]  You walk out on the dock.
[43:56.420 --> 43:57.060]  You hop on the plane.
[43:57.140 --> 43:58.180]  It flies to the other side.
[43:59.520 --> 43:59.960]  Easy.
[44:00.540 --> 44:01.120]  Like 20 minutes.
[44:01.640 --> 44:04.120]  I think there also might be a heli-jet as well.
[44:04.540 --> 44:05.740]  I think there's multiple.
[44:06.220 --> 44:08.060]  They're adding a fast ferry in the summer.
[44:08.700 --> 44:09.780]  You have so much choice.
[44:10.500 --> 44:12.420]  There's a lot of variety to pick from.
[44:12.820 --> 44:14.140]  Anyway, I'm excited and I'm prepared.
[44:14.520 --> 44:16.180]  I've never been on a seaplane.
[44:16.400 --> 44:17.120]  That sounds cool.
[44:17.500 --> 44:20.320]  That's like Indiana Jones or like Jake from Tales from the Gold Monkey.
[44:20.440 --> 44:21.320]  Did you guys ever watch that show?
[44:21.880 --> 44:22.240]  No.
[44:22.620 --> 44:24.300]  What is Tales from the Gold Monkey?
[44:24.300 --> 44:26.780]  It was like an Indiana Jones rip-off in the 80s.
[44:28.260 --> 44:29.280]  I'd love to see.
[44:30.120 --> 44:30.740]  That sounds great.
[44:31.260 --> 44:33.620]  Have we decided what happens if we both are successful?
[44:33.780 --> 44:35.540]  Is that a tie? Is that just a wash at this point?
[44:36.300 --> 44:37.820]  Yeah, I think it's a very expensive tie.
[44:38.280 --> 44:38.580]  Okay.
[44:39.400 --> 44:41.560]  So now you're trying to tie is what you're doing.
[44:42.660 --> 44:44.280]  No, it's not 1-0.
[44:44.380 --> 44:45.140]  Because I've already placed.
[44:45.300 --> 44:47.260]  It's 1-0. You don't even know.
[44:47.500 --> 44:48.180]  Which makes it so funny.
[44:48.680 --> 44:50.620]  But that's like me saying it's 1-0.
[44:51.660 --> 44:53.240]  Well, I've got more places to hide it.
[44:53.240 --> 44:54.700]  Have you found the money yet?
[44:55.220 --> 44:57.160]  It's not on the door. I've checked. There's footage.
[44:57.440 --> 44:59.260]  There's a 0% chance that's happened.
[44:59.620 --> 45:01.700]  Have you checked in the last 40 minutes?
[45:02.200 --> 45:02.720]  No, I haven't.
[45:03.200 --> 45:05.960]  If you put it in the last 40 minutes, that'd be crazy.
[45:06.360 --> 45:08.880]  Wouldn't it be crazy if I was in Austin and you were in my town?
[45:10.440 --> 45:11.240]  Different times.
[45:11.680 --> 45:12.260]  That'd be funny.
[45:13.060 --> 45:15.540]  And I took the ferry, not realizing there was a seaplane.
[45:16.840 --> 45:18.160]  That's why you're so pissed off.
[45:21.200 --> 45:22.880]  Tails and the Gold Monkey looks great.
[45:23.200 --> 45:24.660]  The dog has an eye patch?
[45:25.020 --> 45:26.240]  Yeah, the dog has an eye patch.
[45:28.220 --> 45:29.920]  Why does the dog have an eye patch?
[45:30.140 --> 45:30.860]  I don't know.
[45:31.120 --> 45:32.900]  I mean, I've seen dogs with one eye.
[45:32.980 --> 45:34.320]  I think we've all seen dogs with one eye.
[45:34.380 --> 45:35.620]  Why would he have an eye patch?
[45:35.860 --> 45:38.760]  It was 1982. I was 7 years old.
[45:38.860 --> 45:40.720]  I don't remember. I just remember that I liked it when I was a kid.
[45:40.740 --> 45:43.300]  That's a good point. An animal loses an eye. It just doesn't have an eye.
[45:43.520 --> 45:44.720]  Yeah, does the man...
[45:44.720 --> 45:46.880]  Is he so offended by the dog's one eye?
[45:46.940 --> 45:48.140]  He's like, better patch that up.
[45:48.140 --> 45:49.800]  The dog is embarrassed.
[45:50.400 --> 45:52.200]  I think maybe the dog was self-conscious.
[45:52.400 --> 45:52.860]  I don't know.
[45:53.740 --> 45:56.320]  I have a little follow-up from the last podcast we recorded.
[45:56.900 --> 45:57.800]  I'd love to hear it.
[45:57.940 --> 46:02.220]  I'm not sure whether this would upset you, Andrew, or whether this is something you also get.
[46:03.900 --> 46:08.320]  I sent something to Geoff, and I got 10 Haas back.
[46:09.140 --> 46:11.300]  Oh yeah, no, Geoff gives those Haas out all the time.
[46:11.520 --> 46:12.120]  He's a great Haas guy.
[46:12.140 --> 46:12.860]  Did you get 10 though?
[46:13.240 --> 46:15.060]  I've never counted Geoff's Haas. It's a lot.
[46:15.760 --> 46:22.040]  I gave out 10 Haas to Gavin the other day, because something he said deserved 10 Haas.
[46:22.160 --> 46:25.280]  And then I commented that I meant every one of those Haas.
[46:25.400 --> 46:29.380]  I gave out, I want to say, 7 or 8 Haas to Andrew the other day.
[46:29.880 --> 46:31.700]  It was pretty good, but it wasn't 10, I don't think.
[46:31.800 --> 46:33.360]  What was the 10 Haas? What happened?
[46:33.660 --> 46:37.480]  Oh, I just sent Geoff a clip of some kid kicking a football.
[46:39.860 --> 46:40.540]  That's great.
[46:41.840 --> 46:43.100]  Why didn't I? Can I get the clip?
[46:43.900 --> 46:44.840]  Can I see the clip?
[46:45.500 --> 46:46.320]  I'd love to see it.
[46:46.740 --> 46:48.240]  Let me post it on the old Discord.
[46:48.820 --> 46:50.420]  Is it like a TikTok, or is it a video?
[46:50.600 --> 46:54.620]  I assume it's a TikTok that's on Instagram, which is how I receive all TikToks.
[46:55.500 --> 46:56.400]  Because I'm old.
[46:57.140 --> 47:02.820]  For the audience, it's a kid playing soccer, and the text is Jesus Christ, it's Jason Bourne.
[47:03.380 --> 47:07.720]  And then the kid kicks, the same kid hits the ball into three kids' faces.
[47:08.060 --> 47:08.640]  Back to back to back.
[47:14.520 --> 47:15.560]  That's awesome.
[47:16.140 --> 47:17.340]  That's so cute.
[47:18.980 --> 47:26.340]  My favorite part is that the guy filming points the camera down after the third one.
[47:26.560 --> 47:27.640]  Like, okay, that's too much.
[47:30.180 --> 47:33.700]  I like when the second kid gets hit and runs into the first kid.
[47:33.820 --> 47:35.880]  Like, they're bumping into each other Three Stooges style.
[47:37.200 --> 47:40.420]  I watched it like 15 times.
[47:41.020 --> 47:42.460]  It's fucking chaos.
[47:42.460 --> 47:45.280]  It's a 10 hot clip, for sure.
[47:48.800 --> 47:50.040]  It's the perfect clip.
[47:50.620 --> 47:51.400]  It's a winner.
[47:51.640 --> 47:54.920]  If we were picking top three clips I've seen of the year, that's probably number one.
[47:55.680 --> 47:56.720]  That is amazing.
[47:57.020 --> 47:58.680]  I love that they all give up progressively.
[48:01.920 --> 48:06.300]  Man, that's great.
[48:07.120 --> 48:10.460]  You know, because it's like a TikTok probably posted on Instagram.
[48:10.960 --> 48:13.300]  There's no way of telling who filmed that or who's responsible for it.
[48:13.480 --> 48:13.560]  Yeah.
[48:14.040 --> 48:17.420]  But whoever you are, whoever's kid that is, thanks.
[48:18.700 --> 48:20.200]  That's the funniest joke I've ever seen.
[48:24.030 --> 48:24.790]  It's great.
[48:25.410 --> 48:28.570]  People falling or getting hurt, but not like seriously hurt.
[48:28.830 --> 48:29.650]  Always amazing.
[48:30.090 --> 48:31.530]  It just doesn't stop.
[48:31.670 --> 48:32.790]  It brings me so much joy.
[48:34.330 --> 48:35.830]  The kid is ruthless.
[48:38.250 --> 48:39.510]  He knows what he's doing.
[48:39.770 --> 48:40.990]  And he's still doing it.
[48:42.210 --> 48:45.230]  I like that Gavin said this is something that might upset me.
[48:45.490 --> 48:46.150]  This is great.
[48:46.590 --> 48:47.490]  What a good laugh.
[48:48.570 --> 48:49.890]  That is 10 hot worthy.
[48:50.270 --> 48:50.470]  Absolutely.
[48:50.470 --> 48:52.410]  It is absolutely a 10 hot clip.
[48:53.230 --> 48:57.490]  Gavin, can I subscribe to the clip of children getting hit by things?
[48:57.610 --> 48:58.770]  Or like just any impact?
[48:58.870 --> 49:03.490]  Whatever feed Geoff is on that I'm not on through you, I'm subscribing to that feed.
[49:03.850 --> 49:07.010]  I feel like I don't send my friends clips very often.
[49:07.010 --> 49:10.650]  Like Geoff, you probably had maybe two for me.
[49:10.750 --> 49:11.470]  This year?
[49:11.650 --> 49:11.790]  Yeah.
[49:12.490 --> 49:17.090]  I like to make sure they're all A plus gold star winners.
[49:18.250 --> 49:19.370]  Why not on that list?
[49:19.470 --> 49:20.830]  Because that's a great clip.
[49:21.470 --> 49:27.870]  If you guys had TikTok, I would put you on my list of funny TikToks.
[49:28.750 --> 49:30.410]  She's the only person on my list right now.
[49:30.610 --> 49:33.250]  But I send absolute fucking bangers on TikTok.
[49:33.630 --> 49:34.310]  Put me on your list.
[49:34.310 --> 49:40.290]  I just joined TikTok a week ago because I realized America's funniest home videos is on TikTok.
[49:40.630 --> 49:45.070]  I'm like, I could just watch people fall whenever I want to and bite size.
[49:45.270 --> 49:46.050]  Oh, this is great.
[49:46.350 --> 49:47.690]  Do people shit on TikTok?
[49:47.690 --> 49:50.830]  And I know they're stealing all my data and I know everything about me and stuff now.
[49:50.830 --> 49:52.810]  And they're probably making clones of me in China.
[49:52.990 --> 49:54.550]  But there it is.
[49:54.550 --> 49:56.750]  It is just a fucking nutshot city.
[49:56.750 --> 49:59.650]  It is just hours upon hours.
[50:01.010 --> 50:03.970]  Skateboards, footballs, bicycles, you name it.
[50:03.970 --> 50:05.750]  Just wrecking dicks.
[50:05.790 --> 50:10.330]  I wonder if we should have the official f*** face compilation.
[50:10.810 --> 50:12.670]  Where you go back to everything you sent Emily.
[50:13.350 --> 50:14.910]  And post a link to each one.
[50:16.450 --> 50:17.550]  It's funny you say that.
[50:18.030 --> 50:18.430]  Curated.
[50:19.390 --> 50:21.470]  I kind of did that a little bit already.
[50:21.810 --> 50:24.310]  Because tomorrow, one of the things we're going to film, that I mentioned earlier,
[50:24.390 --> 50:29.910]  is Andrew wants to do this ladder tournament for funniest fall video of the year.
[50:29.910 --> 50:30.070]  Drafting Falls.
[50:30.210 --> 50:30.910]  Drafting Falls.
[50:31.410 --> 50:31.830]  Yes.
[50:33.230 --> 50:36.030]  The only place I found I went to look for fall videos
[50:36.030 --> 50:38.510]  is I just went back through my list of shit I sent to Emily
[50:38.510 --> 50:40.030]  and just pulled the funniest falls I found.
[50:41.250 --> 50:43.630]  I didn't know what you were talking about.
[50:44.190 --> 50:45.370]  Do you understand now?
[50:46.170 --> 50:47.810]  Yeah, but just the way you phrased it.
[50:48.430 --> 50:49.670]  Some of it was my fault.
[50:49.770 --> 50:50.390]  I think some of it...
[50:50.390 --> 50:53.270]  I'm surprised that Eric just didn't know what a snake draft was by now.
[50:53.670 --> 50:54.290]  I just got the message.
[50:54.650 --> 50:56.110]  The snake draft wasn't the confusing part.
[50:56.250 --> 51:00.110]  It's just that we weren't doing it from a pool.
[51:00.110 --> 51:01.590]  You're just like, pick something.
[51:01.710 --> 51:03.030]  I'm like, what's the point of a draft?
[51:03.470 --> 51:06.310]  We're not doing it from a pool, so you just pick some things.
[51:06.550 --> 51:07.470]  The pool is all falls.
[51:08.050 --> 51:09.870]  Right, and you kept saying falls,
[51:10.030 --> 51:11.010]  which is such a, like,
[51:12.090 --> 51:14.750]  not a thing that you would actively draft from.
[51:15.150 --> 51:16.350]  Yeah, without context,
[51:16.690 --> 51:17.310]  I just read,
[51:17.510 --> 51:20.430]  four of us could record a supplemental of doing a snake draft
[51:20.430 --> 51:21.390]  of our favorite falls.
[51:22.150 --> 51:24.410]  I was like, what does that mean?
[51:24.430 --> 51:25.750]  I think outside of snake draft,
[51:25.870 --> 51:26.450]  it's very clear.
[51:27.390 --> 51:27.790]  I...
[51:28.310 --> 51:30.090]  I mean, I guess so.
[51:30.750 --> 51:32.230]  There's no pool we're drawing from.
[51:32.470 --> 51:34.070]  It's just pick some falls that you like.
[51:34.190 --> 51:36.050]  I don't know what the point of the snake draft is
[51:36.050 --> 51:37.530]  if we're not doing it from a pool.
[51:38.010 --> 51:41.130]  Geoff said, I'll do it. I said, I don't know what you just said.
[51:41.790 --> 51:41.970]  Yeah.
[51:42.310 --> 51:42.730]  I understand.
[51:44.030 --> 51:44.730]  I think it's straightforward.
[51:45.450 --> 51:47.230]  The snake draft doesn't make sense to me.
[51:48.050 --> 51:50.370]  It's falls. I don't know what, but that's the pool.
[51:50.550 --> 51:52.090]  I don't understand how that's not a pool.
[51:52.630 --> 51:53.370]  It's not, because
[51:53.370 --> 51:55.590]  when you say basketball
[51:55.590 --> 51:56.830]  teams, it means...
[51:56.830 --> 51:59.570]  Do you think the NFL draft only picks quarterbacks one year?
[51:59.670 --> 52:00.350]  Like, what do you think?
[52:00.630 --> 52:01.850]  What are you talking about?
[52:01.890 --> 52:05.630]  I think that they choose from a pool
[52:05.630 --> 52:06.670]  of players who have entered
[52:07.250 --> 52:09.490]  that people have gone through and chosen
[52:09.490 --> 52:11.610]  from, so I do think that there's
[52:11.610 --> 52:13.510]  a pool, because you can't... here's the thing.
[52:13.650 --> 52:15.390]  They're not drafting me, Andrew.
[52:15.730 --> 52:16.670]  No, I'm going to dispute that.
[52:16.850 --> 52:18.290]  They're not drafting me.
[52:19.590 --> 52:21.250]  The Buffalo Sabres
[52:21.250 --> 52:23.350]  drafted a guy that isn't even
[52:23.350 --> 52:25.310]  fucking real. They made up
[52:25.310 --> 52:27.010]  a human being and drafted him.
[52:27.110 --> 52:29.290]  As a joke. It's happened.
[52:29.730 --> 52:30.530]  You idiot.
[52:31.310 --> 52:33.190]  To quote Gavin, you
[52:33.190 --> 52:35.210]  fool. They've done this.
[52:35.630 --> 52:37.070]  Who did they draft that's not real?
[52:37.470 --> 52:39.290]  What? That hockey... Nick just said
[52:39.290 --> 52:40.550]  that hockey league drafted him.
[52:43.830 --> 52:44.430]  Spoiler!
[52:45.790 --> 52:46.570]  You know what?
[52:47.550 --> 52:48.510]  I stand...
[52:48.510 --> 52:49.650]  I will...
[52:50.210 --> 52:52.650]  I'll admit that I was wrong, because Nick is right.
[52:53.310 --> 52:54.530]  The hockey league drafted a
[52:54.530 --> 52:55.810]  monkey, so I stand corrected.
[52:56.770 --> 52:57.570]  Taro Tsujimoto.
[52:58.390 --> 53:00.530]  He's a made-up player picked by the
[53:00.530 --> 53:02.710]  Bruins in the 1974 draft.
[53:03.090 --> 53:03.870]  In the 11th round.
[53:04.530 --> 53:06.550]  They did it as a joke. They're like, wouldn't it be funny
[53:06.550 --> 53:08.790]  if we just snuck a player in that doesn't exist
[53:08.790 --> 53:09.850]  and we'll see if anyone notices?
[53:10.190 --> 53:12.390]  And he became the hype of the team.
[53:12.670 --> 53:14.590]  Everyone's fucking excited for this guy that wasn't real.
[53:15.370 --> 53:16.450]  I gotta say, tell me.
[53:16.450 --> 53:17.370]  You have to be eligible.
[53:18.170 --> 53:20.170]  Hockey does wacky shit that other sports
[53:20.170 --> 53:21.730]  just aren't brave enough to do.
[53:22.070 --> 53:23.530]  Like, hockey does not take it...
[53:23.530 --> 53:25.610]  For a sport that's all about beating the shit out of each other,
[53:25.750 --> 53:28.490]  it really doesn't take itself too seriously. I appreciate that about it.
[53:28.990 --> 53:29.670]  Sometimes it does.
[53:29.810 --> 53:31.590]  In ways that suck, it does.
[53:31.690 --> 53:32.950]  In ways that suck, it does, for sure.
[53:33.130 --> 53:36.030]  But they have, like, a high sense of humor, I would say.
[53:36.470 --> 53:38.370]  I wonder if there's anything in the actual rules
[53:38.370 --> 53:40.570]  that prevent... Like, obviously, there's no reason to,
[53:40.670 --> 53:42.230]  but could they draft someone
[53:42.230 --> 53:44.010]  that they wanted to just because?
[53:44.010 --> 53:46.110]  Like, you are
[53:46.870 --> 53:48.510]  involuntarily drafted to, like,
[53:48.750 --> 53:50.230]  the Blackhawks or something?
[53:50.370 --> 53:52.510]  You're just like, oh man, I'm on the Penguins now.
[53:52.610 --> 53:52.850]  Shit.
[53:53.270 --> 53:55.870]  I mean, in the NFL and NBA,
[53:56.070 --> 53:57.970]  there's eligibility requirements, right?
[53:58.070 --> 54:00.530]  So, aren't they in hockey in some way?
[54:00.650 --> 54:02.150]  Maybe they've added them, but I mean,
[54:02.230 --> 54:04.150]  they definitely drafted a guy that
[54:04.150 --> 54:06.190]  didn't exist in the past.
[54:07.730 --> 54:08.650]  So it's happened.
[54:08.970 --> 54:10.590]  Anyway, I think it'll be fun.
[54:11.090 --> 54:12.010]  I think we'll have a good time.
[54:12.750 --> 54:13.150]  Yeah.
[54:13.170 --> 54:14.090]  Sharing some falls.
[54:15.790 --> 54:17.750]  I think it could become... I was telling Andrew
[54:17.750 --> 54:19.410]  when we were talking about it earlier,
[54:19.610 --> 54:22.030]  it could become a yearly thing we do in the fall.
[54:22.830 --> 54:23.210]  It could.
[54:23.570 --> 54:23.990]  Fall falls.
[54:24.790 --> 54:25.190]  Yeah.
[54:27.050 --> 54:29.330]  I have four that I'm very excited about.
[54:29.430 --> 54:31.590]  I need to do some more research, figure out
[54:32.650 --> 54:34.110]  what things are on my board
[54:34.110 --> 54:36.150]  and where. I have one that I'm worried
[54:36.150 --> 54:37.150]  Eric is going to steal.
[54:38.290 --> 54:40.110]  Outside of that, I feel pretty good about my other ones.
[54:40.110 --> 54:41.790]  I have... well, let me just say,
[54:42.530 --> 54:44.170]  when I sat down to think about what
[54:44.170 --> 54:45.710]  the greatest falls of all time are,
[54:45.830 --> 54:48.170]  I think I probably came up with a lot of ones that y'all have
[54:48.170 --> 54:50.330]  as well. And so I'm going to go
[54:50.330 --> 54:51.750]  the other route and I'm going to try
[54:51.750 --> 54:54.250]  and find only falls you've never seen before
[54:54.250 --> 54:55.190]  that are more obscure.
[54:55.490 --> 54:57.590]  Because otherwise we'll all have the Grape Lady.
[54:57.690 --> 54:58.730]  We're all going to have Grape Lady.
[54:58.910 --> 55:00.830]  Only one person can have the Grape Lady, though.
[55:01.590 --> 55:03.730]  But we're all going to submit
[55:04.150 --> 55:06.290]  four falls each and there's going to be four copies
[55:06.290 --> 55:06.770]  of Grape Lady.
[55:06.770 --> 55:09.150]  So I'm trying to...
[55:09.150 --> 55:09.570]  Oh good lord.
[55:10.030 --> 55:11.110]  Oh good lord.
[55:11.490 --> 55:16.690]  But I'm a little concerned
[55:16.690 --> 55:18.430]  going through my TikToks trying to find them.
[55:18.950 --> 55:20.610]  There's a fine line, I think, between
[55:20.610 --> 55:22.890]  falling and crashing and I don't know which side
[55:22.890 --> 55:25.050]  of it, what your tolerance
[55:25.050 --> 55:26.830]  level is. Is it falling if you
[55:26.830 --> 55:27.710]  go up first?
[55:29.830 --> 55:30.850]  I think so.
[55:31.050 --> 55:31.810]  I think so, yeah.
[55:32.530 --> 55:35.170]  I got a great one. I was thinking of movie falls.
[55:35.170 --> 55:36.630]  I was thinking of
[55:37.770 --> 55:38.770]  sports falls.
[55:39.310 --> 55:41.410]  Entertainment falls. I've been trying to decide
[55:41.410 --> 55:43.310]  if my sushi fall is draftable
[55:43.310 --> 55:45.170]  because there's no visual to see, but that was
[55:45.170 --> 55:47.010]  genuinely a great fall.
[55:47.430 --> 55:48.990]  I mean, could you recreate it somehow?
[55:49.630 --> 55:51.270]  I wouldn't want... it would be too
[55:51.270 --> 55:53.010]  dangerous to recreate it slung up.
[55:53.410 --> 55:55.190]  That was a perfect
[55:55.190 --> 55:57.070]  fall that could have been catastrophic
[55:57.070 --> 55:59.450]  but I landed it.
[56:00.250 --> 56:01.230]  Should we have a little
[56:01.230 --> 56:03.250]  end of the year ankle checkup? What were we at?
[56:03.250 --> 56:05.550]  Oh, yeah, we could do that.
[56:06.150 --> 56:07.310]  Got all sorts of options.
[56:08.290 --> 56:09.210]  Where's your ankle at?
[56:10.170 --> 56:10.810]  Right now?
[56:11.270 --> 56:12.930]  Yeah, like 85%.
[56:12.930 --> 56:13.790]  I'd say.
[56:14.890 --> 56:17.150]  We could grof this. If we ask you every week,
[56:17.770 --> 56:19.190]  we could get a shot going.
[56:19.710 --> 56:21.390]  You could. I'd say 85% right now.
[56:22.270 --> 56:23.370]  Got a little tightness in my right
[56:23.370 --> 56:25.250]  Achilles, but that's okay. And every time it
[56:25.250 --> 56:27.470]  plummets, we'll write a sushi box.
[56:28.910 --> 56:29.690]  Sushi grade?
[56:30.230 --> 56:30.450]  Yeah.
[56:31.430 --> 56:32.550]  Yeah, that's great.
[56:32.850 --> 56:34.670]  How are your ankles, Gavin?
[56:35.450 --> 56:36.010]  Oh, fine.
[56:36.450 --> 56:37.930]  Haven't tried to move a table in a while.
[56:38.510 --> 56:39.630]  Okay, so you're fully recovered?
[56:39.830 --> 56:42.450]  Fully recovered. I could do a marathon tomorrow.
[56:43.710 --> 56:44.150]  Really?
[56:44.970 --> 56:45.790]  Yeah, I will if you will.
[56:46.270 --> 56:48.230]  I think I have to now, right? Because of the
[56:48.230 --> 56:50.710]  whole thing I activated?
[56:51.290 --> 56:52.030]  With the trash?
[56:52.810 --> 56:54.310]  Oh, you're right.
[56:54.870 --> 56:55.970]  I think I'm due now.
[56:56.310 --> 56:56.550]  Tomorrow?
[56:57.190 --> 56:58.210]  No, I can't do tomorrow.
[56:58.550 --> 56:58.870]  Okay.
[57:00.850 --> 57:02.250]  I'm going to be tired tomorrow.
[57:03.010 --> 57:03.870]  On office day?
[57:04.370 --> 57:06.510]  On office day, yes. It's a busy, busy day.
[57:06.730 --> 57:08.530]  Got a lot of stuff to do. It is a busy day.
[57:08.870 --> 57:09.910]  We do have a lot of stuff to do.
[57:10.650 --> 57:12.750]  I did a thing that I think I'm the only one
[57:12.750 --> 57:14.570]  who prepared for, because I'm going to be
[57:14.570 --> 57:16.090]  honest, I forgot, and then I remembered
[57:16.450 --> 57:18.570]  a few days ago. I have a stuffing
[57:18.570 --> 57:20.550]  recipe. Oh good, so do I.
[57:21.150 --> 57:22.270]  Oh, you do? That's great.
[57:22.710 --> 57:24.450]  Perfect. I think I'm going to forget my own
[57:24.450 --> 57:25.690]  contest, my own thing.
[57:26.630 --> 57:28.450]  It was something we kind of talked about in
[57:28.450 --> 57:30.050]  passing, I wasn't sure, but yeah, I'm ready
[57:30.050 --> 57:31.510]  for the deep lore about stuffing.
[57:32.650 --> 57:34.370]  Okay, so I have a
[57:34.370 --> 57:35.930]  question about that. We are
[57:36.310 --> 57:38.490]  fucking an hour in almost, 55 minutes in.
[57:38.550 --> 57:40.370]  Do we want to do our stuffing recipes now, or
[57:40.370 --> 57:41.290]  save it for the next episode?
[57:42.750 --> 57:44.390]  If we don't take
[57:44.390 --> 57:45.990]  forever on it, I think we can do it now.
[57:46.430 --> 57:48.570]  I don't know if Gavin has one. I'd be shocked
[57:48.570 --> 57:49.470]  if Gavin has one.
[57:50.970 --> 57:52.150]  Also, I'm confused.
[57:52.150 --> 57:54.250]  Were we supposed to come with a stuffing recipe
[57:54.250 --> 57:55.770]  or a Thanksgiving recipe?
[57:56.390 --> 57:58.030]  Stuffing recipe. Stuffing recipe?
[57:58.650 --> 58:00.150]  I thought it was a recipe
[58:00.150 --> 58:02.270]  for a Thanksgiving food.
[58:03.130 --> 58:04.410]  I have two Thanksgiving
[58:04.410 --> 58:06.150]  recipes that are not stuffing,
[58:06.410 --> 58:08.170]  but I guess you can turn them into stuffing.
[58:08.650 --> 58:10.130]  And then Nick is saying the same thing. I thought
[58:10.130 --> 58:12.330]  it was what Eric thinks. I thought it was just a recipe for Thanksgiving
[58:12.330 --> 58:14.190]  and then the name of the book was
[58:14.190 --> 58:16.250]  deep lore about stuffing. You know what?
[58:16.350 --> 58:18.410]  You might be right, and I might be. I am,
[58:18.430 --> 58:20.290]  but I'm just making sure you guys know that. I might be getting caught up
[58:20.290 --> 58:22.370]  in the name. I definitely came up with a
[58:22.370 --> 58:24.150]  stuffing recipe. I think I probably
[58:24.150 --> 58:26.290]  conflated the two, even when
[58:26.290 --> 58:28.250]  I was talking about it and was of two minds.
[58:28.970 --> 58:30.250]  I think I wanted
[58:30.250 --> 58:32.430]  it to be a stuffing recipe, but I also
[58:32.430 --> 58:34.510]  think I mentioned that we should all trade
[58:34.510 --> 58:36.390]  Thanksgiving recipes with the audience.
[58:36.950 --> 58:38.490]  So, I think I was confusing about it. That makes sense.
[58:38.490 --> 58:40.230]  Yeah. Well, I want the recipes
[58:40.230 --> 58:41.190]  anyway that you have, Eric.
[58:42.010 --> 58:44.230]  Yeah, absolutely. All recipes are valid.
[58:44.330 --> 58:46.390]  It sounds like Nick's got them, Eric's got
[58:46.390 --> 58:47.570]  them, I've got them,
[58:47.570 --> 58:49.710]  and Andrew's got them.
[58:50.730 --> 58:51.730]  Gavin, what about you?
[58:52.230 --> 58:52.750]  Oh, I've got one.
[58:53.490 --> 58:55.650]  Oh, good. I've got one if I go last.
[58:56.650 --> 58:57.050]  No!
[58:58.010 --> 58:59.310]  No, I think that
[58:59.310 --> 59:00.950]  Gavin should go ahead and go first.
[59:03.150 --> 59:03.550]  Alright,
[59:03.710 --> 59:05.190]  that's going to change things slightly. Hold on.
[59:07.670 --> 59:09.450]  My browser's just crashed a little bit there.
[59:13.510 --> 59:14.310]  Does anybody's
[59:14.310 --> 59:15.630]  recipe come with a story?
[59:16.030 --> 59:16.430]  No.
[59:17.070 --> 59:19.590]  I don't have a really long story about it
[59:19.590 --> 59:21.010]  or whatever, but mine...
[59:22.230 --> 59:24.070]  I brought a food and a drink.
[59:24.370 --> 59:25.810]  Why don't you go first,
[59:25.970 --> 59:26.750]  Eric? Why don't you lead it off?
[59:26.870 --> 59:28.570]  Yeah, that's fine. I'll give Gavin some time.
[59:29.990 --> 59:30.670]  Yeah, no problem.
[59:31.130 --> 59:32.790]  The first is just a drink.
[59:33.110 --> 59:35.410]  This is what you can be sipping on
[59:35.410 --> 59:36.590]  while you make this food.
[59:36.790 --> 59:39.250]  It is a peppermint bark
[59:39.250 --> 59:39.790]  white Russian.
[59:40.770 --> 59:42.930]  I don't know if you guys have ever had rumchata.
[59:42.930 --> 59:44.070]  Geoff, you're excluded.
[59:45.290 --> 59:46.950]  Rumchata is like a liqueur.
[59:47.090 --> 59:47.790]  It's very nice.
[59:48.070 --> 59:49.710]  What I do is I mix some vodka.
[59:50.010 --> 59:51.830]  It's usually about two ounces
[59:53.410 --> 59:55.030]  with an ounce to an ounce
[59:55.030 --> 59:56.290]  and a half of rumchata
[59:56.290 --> 59:58.290]  and another half ounce of Kahlua.
[59:58.610 --> 01:00:00.370]  You're just making a white Russian.
[01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:01.890]  It's very creamy. It's very nice.
[01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:03.910]  Just the right amount of boozy.
[01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:07.030]  While you're making my grandma's
[01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:08.390]  pumpkin pie cheesecake.
[01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:10.630]  I know that sounds like it would be a cheesecake
[01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:12.530]  that is pumpkin pie. It's not.
[01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:14.890]  It is a pumpkin pie with a layer
[01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:16.510]  of cheesecake on the bottom.
[01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:18.090]  Which is
[01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:20.310]  the right... I love it
[01:00:20.310 --> 01:00:22.750]  every year because it is
[01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.550]  the right mix of sweet with
[01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:26.670]  like creamy and a little tart
[01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:27.630]  the way that
[01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:30.250]  the way that sort of
[01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:32.510]  you need something to break up the sweetness
[01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:34.110]  of the pumpkin pie.
[01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:36.810]  Making the cheesecake is just like making a regular
[01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:38.770]  cheesecake just whipping the cream cheese together
[01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:40.170]  with sugar
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:42.310]  and then putting it into
[01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:44.650]  already made pie crust because grandma doesn't
[01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:46.370]  need to make a pie from scratch.
[01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:48.550]  And then you... pumpkin pie
[01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:50.110]  filling is just a bunch of
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.590]  spices mixed in with pumpkin
[01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:54.470]  puree, some evaporated milk and some
[01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:56.150]  eggs. That's just mixing.
[01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:58.270]  My grandma said whisk that together slow
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:00.390]  and then pour it on top of the cheesecake
[01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.390]  slow. And then
[01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:03.990]  you just put it in the oven.
[01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:06.530]  You put it in the oven. It's so easy to do. Look, I got a whole
[01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.470]  written out recipe but I'm not gonna bore you with all the
[01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:09.690]  details. Do we have a picture?
[01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:12.270]  I don't have a picture because
[01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:14.250]  it's... I mean I can show you
[01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:16.450]  somebody else's pumpkin pie cheesecake I guess.
[01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:18.710]  No, what we'll
[01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:20.650]  do is we'll take the recipes
[01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:22.650]  and we'll write them out and then we'll... I guess we'll
[01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:24.070]  put them on Instagram.
[01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:26.310]  I'm ready
[01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:28.370]  with mine. Oh, fantastic.
[01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:30.630]  Go for it, Gavin. By the way, Eric, I think those sounded fantastic.
[01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:32.670]  Fantastic. Thank you.
[01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:34.150]  Okay.
[01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:36.370]  So, can of
[01:01:36.370 --> 01:01:37.870]  beets and tater tots.
[01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:40.130]  Well, it's cranberry,
[01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.090]  isn't it? In a can. Yeah. Oh, sorry.
[01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:43.670]  That's your recipe?
[01:01:44.010 --> 01:01:45.410]  Some cranberry and... okay.
[01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:47.810]  That could be good. I've never combined those flavors.
[01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:49.470]  So you slice the cranberry
[01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:51.790]  to... Do you have any seasoning?
[01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:54.070]  Do you make like a cranberry sandwich out of the
[01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:55.830]  slices of cranberry with
[01:01:55.830 --> 01:01:58.250]  tater tots? No, you put this
[01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:00.470]  in the turkey. Oh, you put it in the turkey.
[01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:02.110]  Yeah, this is the actual stuffing.
[01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:04.110]  Oh, this is stuffing. Yeah.
[01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:06.210]  I see. Have you tried
[01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:07.810]  this? Is this like a family
[01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:09.950]  tradition that happens every year?
[01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:12.110]  Since I was a kid at Thanksgiving every year
[01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:13.570]  as a child in England.
[01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:16.310]  This is what was in my turkey.
[01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:18.330]  The worst part
[01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:20.150]  about this is I feel like we have to cook
[01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:22.150]  a turkey with this in it to see what
[01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:24.290]  happens. I'll be honest, as soon as both these pictures
[01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:26.290]  came up, I thought, hmm, that's probably quite good.
[01:02:28.690 --> 01:02:29.690]  I could see
[01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:31.250]  there's like some seasoning.
[01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:33.570]  I think you could do something
[01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:34.650]  with that blend of the potato.
[01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:37.670]  Yeah, I think it's great.
[01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:40.750]  That's really good, Gav.
[01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:43.710]  Honestly, for somebody who's not
[01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:45.710]  a native-born American to come
[01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:47.870]  up with a uniquely American
[01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:49.170]  recipe, I think you killed it.
[01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:53.710]  You put the typical American amount
[01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:54.630]  of effort into a thing.
[01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:55.330]  I love it.
[01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:59.970]  Nick, did you have something?
[01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:02.550]  I've got a uniquely American recipe
[01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:03.790]  that I came up with this year.
[01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:05.890]  You know how when you're
[01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:08.710]  on your third day of leftovers, you get a little
[01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:10.430]  tired of the same stuff, right? So I wanted to
[01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:12.370]  experiment. I had a bunch of
[01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:14.510]  leftover pecan pie, and I was
[01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:16.350]  like, I don't want to just eat it this way.
[01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:18.330]  So I cut a huge slice of it, and I
[01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:20.310]  dropped it into the blender with
[01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:22.210]  a couple of scoops of ice cream, vanilla,
[01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:24.270]  some chocolate chips,
[01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:26.150]  and then just a bit of
[01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:28.350]  chocolate syrup and a splash of milk.
[01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:30.310]  And you just blend that all
[01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:32.590]  up until you have a nice pumpkin pie
[01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:34.270]  milkshake. Now, if that's
[01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:36.150]  a little too sweet for you, and also
[01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:38.190]  this isn't for you, Geoff, but you can cut
[01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:40.250]  that with a little bit of bourbon for some
[01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.250]  extra flavor.
[01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:43.490]  That sounds great.
[01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:45.930]  I feel like Geoff is really being left out of these,
[01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:47.750]  because they have booze and milk.
[01:03:48.310 --> 01:03:50.150]  That's okay, that's okay. I'm okay with
[01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:52.370]  milk as a component. The booze
[01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:54.110]  I don't get to do as well, but I will say
[01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:56.290]  listening to
[01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:57.970]  Nick describe it was delicious.
[01:03:58.690 --> 01:04:00.110]  Yeah, he did a great job.
[01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:01.770]  Yeah, you did a fantastic job. You got that
[01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.070]  radio voice down.
[01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:06.070]  I really appreciate that Eric and Nick both went
[01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:08.050]  into their own... they have a personal
[01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:09.750]  story for it. There seems to be some
[01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:12.370]  layers to it. It's not just a recipe.
[01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:13.410]  Yeah, they went deep.
[01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:15.770]  Yeah, for sure. What about you, Andrew?
[01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:18.150]  See, that's the thing. I just crafted
[01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:20.270]  a recipe. I haven't made this yet,
[01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:22.290]  so I don't know if this is good or
[01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:24.330]  not. I'll just copy and paste
[01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:26.170]  my ingredients for
[01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:26.850]  my stuffing.
[01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:30.070]  I switched it up a little bit, going with an
[01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:31.950]  untraditional bread choice,
[01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:34.350]  I would say. Instead of standard bread,
[01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:36.190]  challah. Use a challah loaf.
[01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:38.550]  Challah is delicious. It's gonna be a sweeter
[01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:40.410]  stuffing, I imagine.
[01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:42.350]  It also contains butter,
[01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:43.910]  melted kosher salt,
[01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:45.910]  freshly ground black pepper, olive oil,
[01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:47.770]  shallots, minced garlic, chopped
[01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:49.830]  rosemary, two granny smith
[01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:51.790]  apples, and one cosmic crisp apple,
[01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:53.870]  chopped walnuts, pecans,
[01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:56.050]  low-sodium chicken broth, half a teaspoon of cinnamon,
[01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:57.410]  and a pinch of nutmeg.
[01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:59.910]  I think there's a good balance of flavors. It could be
[01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:01.570]  terrible. I haven't tried it yet.
[01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:03.870]  I need to try it. I'll try to do
[01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:05.890]  that this weekend. Oh, I would love to see
[01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:07.910]  if that's good, because that's a lot of work. That is my recipe.
[01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:09.830]  It seems like a lot of work. I also have
[01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:11.610]  instructions for making it,
[01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:13.790]  but I haven't done it yet, so we'll see
[01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:15.530]  how accurate those are. Okay!
[01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:17.010]  I think that looks delicious.
[01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:18.410]  I agree with you.
[01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:21.810]  It's honestly not that different from
[01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:23.710]  mine, which is interesting. I think we kind of went in
[01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:25.850]  similar places. I did the same thing as
[01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:27.610]  you, Andrew, in that I haven't actually
[01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.390]  made my recipe yet.
[01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:32.250]  I kind of crafted it
[01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:33.810]  from kind of
[01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:35.210]  the bones of two different recipes,
[01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:37.670]  but I'm so certain that my
[01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:39.710]  recipe is delicious that I'm gonna
[01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:41.810]  put my name on it. And I'm so, so,
[01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:43.910]  so certain it's delicious, I'm never
[01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:45.610]  going to cook it.
[01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:47.650]  I don't need to.
[01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:49.830]  I don't need to eat it. I know it's that
[01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:51.950]  good. I want the world to eat it,
[01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:53.890]  but I've eaten it in my
[01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:55.890]  mind. So, just throwing that out there
[01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:57.890]  ahead of time. Here's how my
[01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:59.850]  approach went. I wanted to do the
[01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:01.310]  atypical American thing.
[01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:03.610]  I wanted to put a lot of effort and to work
[01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:05.850]  into this, and I wanted this recipe
[01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:07.590]  to kind of speak for me
[01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:09.730]  and to be kind of of and about me, and so I
[01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:11.410]  wanted to figure out a way to make it unique.
[01:06:11.790 --> 01:06:13.830]  And so, I didn't know what that meant exactly,
[01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.690]  but I just knew that I was going to put it out into
[01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:16.870]  the world. Kind of like when
[01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:19.830]  Uniform needs an idea. You kind of put it out
[01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:21.750]  into the world and then you just kind of see what comes
[01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:23.270]  at you, right? And so,
[01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:25.850]  a lot of people probably don't know this as well,
[01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:28.010]  but every Saturday,
[01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:29.870]  pretty much every Saturday
[01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:31.410]  if I'm in town, Emily
[01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:33.630]  and I go to estate sales
[01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:34.850]  all over Austin
[01:06:35.330 --> 01:06:37.310]  and the surrounding Central Texas areas
[01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:39.530]  because Emily is obsessed
[01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:41.330]  with buying stuff from
[01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:41.830]  dead women.
[01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:45.370]  No, it's just
[01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:47.190]  something to do, and you know,
[01:06:47.350 --> 01:06:49.390]  you guys know about the tiny town and stuff, like
[01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:51.310]  that shit is expensive. People are like, how the fuck
[01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:52.810]  do you have so much tiny town? It's because
[01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:54.990]  old ladies die all the time
[01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:57.250]  and it's old people's stuff.
[01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:58.870]  If you want Christmas decorations,
[01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:00.210]  go to an estate sale.
[01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:03.350]  Old people hoard Christmas
[01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:04.990]  decorations. That's why Emily has
[01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:06.850]  an entire storage unit full of it.
[01:07:06.930 --> 01:07:09.010]  It's been a whole running gag on the other podcast
[01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:10.990]  I do with Gus. We had to rent a
[01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:12.610]  U-Haul truck to get all the storage.
[01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:15.070]  We had to get... I'll send you guys a photo
[01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:16.850]  actually. We had to rent a U-Haul truck to
[01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:18.870]  move all of the Christmas stuff
[01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:20.870]  from our storage to our house this year.
[01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:22.530]  Was it cheaper than renting a car?
[01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:25.130]  It was like 60 bucks.
[01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:26.330]  But it was better than
[01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:29.010]  filling up her SUV 17
[01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:30.930]  times, going back and forth
[01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:31.830]  and back and forth and back and forth.
[01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:33.810]  Anyway, so every Saturday
[01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:35.750]  we go out and we go to estate sales. So I thought, I'm going to
[01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:37.850]  put it out in the universe that I'm looking for this recipe
[01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:39.850]  this Saturday we're going to estate sales
[01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:41.870]  and I'm going to see what comes back at me. We end
[01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:43.890]  up in this area north of
[01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:45.770]  Austin that's like a retirement community, right?
[01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:47.870]  And they have a golf
[01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:49.770]  course on the retirement community. And I thought,
[01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:51.710]  oh, it must be nice if you're into golfing and like
[01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:53.410]  it's right there for you. You never have to leave, right?
[01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:55.730]  We go into a house, go into
[01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:57.610]  their living room and the living room is just
[01:07:57.610 --> 01:07:59.810]  one giant picture window of
[01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:01.610]  the golf course, but like on
[01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:03.770]  the course, like I can see people putting
[01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:05.810]  on one of the greens. I could throw
[01:08:05.810 --> 01:08:07.670]  a baseball and hit them, they're so close. And I'm like,
[01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:09.390]  god damn, that's wild. And then I look around
[01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:12.030]  and everything in this house is themed
[01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:13.670]  golf. Like every
[01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:15.850]  glass and coffee cup is like
[01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:17.770]  a golf pun and there's
[01:08:17.770 --> 01:08:20.010]  like golf flags from different places
[01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:21.270]  hanging from the walls
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.670]  and there's like little wooden golf figures
[01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:25.510]  everywhere and there's like
[01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:27.790]  fucking ashtrays that
[01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:29.870]  are golf shit. Like everything is golf
[01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:31.870]  related. And I'm kind of like looking at all these little knickknacks
[01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:33.690]  and kind of like laughing at how silly
[01:08:33.690 --> 01:08:35.810]  they are. And I see
[01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.310]  I'm going to send you guys a picture.
[01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:39.390]  This catches my eye.
[01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:41.470]  I stopped talking too soon.
[01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.690]  Too powerful? Okay.
[01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:45.930]  Uh, this catches my eye.
[01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:47.770]  God
[01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:49.750]  damn it, how can it be too powerful?
[01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:50.370]  Eric.
[01:08:52.690 --> 01:08:53.510]  Eric, can we get
[01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:54.470]  Nitro for Discord?
[01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:56.370]  I just
[01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:58.090]  got, I was emailing with
[01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:00.350]  not our finance people, but going
[01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:02.650]  above them to our financiers
[01:09:02.650 --> 01:09:04.330]  and saying, how do I unblock this
[01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:05.170]  earlier this week?
[01:09:05.830 --> 01:09:07.590]  Okay, so I apologize.
[01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:10.370]  I apologize, it's going up in Slack right now.
[01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:12.470]  I stumble upon this
[01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:13.310]  on their shelf.
[01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:15.890]  It is a
[01:09:16.330 --> 01:09:18.790]  cookbook called Favorite Recipes
[01:09:18.790 --> 01:09:20.170]  from the Ramsey
[01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:21.970]  Golf and Country Club
[01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:24.290]  from Ramsey,
[01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:26.110]  New Jersey. And I think to myself,
[01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:27.570]  a recipe book
[01:09:27.570 --> 01:09:30.070]  from a country club from a
[01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:32.110]  place called Ramsey, New Jersey
[01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:34.070]  the town is named after
[01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:36.010]  me, the country club and the
[01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:38.030]  golf course are named after me? I gotta
[01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:39.950]  get this. And it's spelled right?
[01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.070]  So I buy the Favorite
[01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:44.010]  Recipes book and thinking
[01:09:44.010 --> 01:09:46.130]  oh, this is awesome, there's sure to be something in there.
[01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:49.490]  Sure enough,
[01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:51.110]  on page 31,
[01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:53.690]  or no, I'm sorry, on page 63,
[01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:55.270]  there is a recipe
[01:09:56.130 --> 01:09:57.330]  for Waldorf stuffing.
[01:09:57.710 --> 01:09:58.830]  And I think like, oh great!
[01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:00.890]  But then I feel like, it's like
[01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:03.310]  speaks to me and I'm like, oh, maybe I'll use this
[01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:04.750]  or I'll figure out, I'll use it as the base.
[01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:07.270]  Then Emily's family comes into town for Thanksgiving and her
[01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:08.210]  uncle Daryl
[01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:11.130]  makes his own stuffing
[01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:13.550]  and it's fucking delicious. And I'm like, oh my god,
[01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:15.210]  I've got this stuffing right here in front of me.
[01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:17.370]  This thing is phenomenal.
[01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:18.870]  His was like a traditional stuffing,
[01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:21.210]  the one on the recipe book is like a Waldorf stuffing.
[01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:23.710]  And so, after Daryl,
[01:10:24.150 --> 01:10:25.230]  after he left,
[01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:27.270]  I got thinking about it
[01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:29.050]  and I wanted to honor his stuffing in some way,
[01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:31.250]  so I combined the two
[01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:33.550]  recipes into
[01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:35.110]  this.
[01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:38.890]  I can't put a fucking photo up.
[01:10:39.690 --> 01:10:40.930]  Here's my, I call it
[01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:43.510]  Geoff and Daryl's, he has no idea I made this
[01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:44.690]  and it would probably creep him out if he did.
[01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:46.910]  Geoff and Daryl's Waldorf
[01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:48.350]  Wonderstuffing, for,
[01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:50.650]  as inspired by the people of the Ramsey
[01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:52.770]  Golf and Country Club in Ramsey, New Jersey.
[01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:54.150]  And it is,
[01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.430]  much like you, Andrew, it includes a cosmic
[01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:58.610]  crisp apple, it includes, I'm not gonna go
[01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:00.550]  through the whole steps, but it includes onions,
[01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:02.570]  celery, lots of butter,
[01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:04.650]  dried breadcrumbs with two
[01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:05.890]  different ways to prepare them,
[01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:08.310]  salt, pepper, poultry seasoning,
[01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:11.030]  a little herb de Provence, some chopped pecans,
[01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:12.450]  water, egg,
[01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:14.610]  well-beaten orange peel zest,
[01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.350]  and I gave you
[01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:18.630]  specific instructions on how to cook it
[01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:20.390]  with two versions,
[01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:22.470]  one if you want it to be stuffing, and one if you
[01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:24.510]  only want it to be dressing, because they are two different
[01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:26.170]  things, prepared slightly differently.
[01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:28.410]  Boom, Geoff and Daryl's
[01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:29.910]  Waldorf Wonderstuffing, for,
[01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:31.190]  I think it needs grapes.
[01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:34.270]  You don't, no. Celery,
[01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:36.390]  apples, walnuts, grapes. Waldorf.
[01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:38.110]  Nah, it doesn't need grapes.
[01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:40.510]  Oh. Grapes don't work, don't work
[01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:42.050]  in a stuffing. That's fair.
[01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:44.250]  I'd be weirded out if there were grapes.
[01:11:46.450 --> 01:11:47.490]  Grapes aren't stuffing food.
[01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:49.550]  Anyway, so that's mine.
[01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:52.290]  I put way too much time and effort
[01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:53.830]  into it, and
[01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:56.330]  anyway, shout out to the people of Ramsey,
[01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:57.690]  New Jersey, I didn't know you existed,
[01:11:58.190 --> 01:12:00.410]  but we are the same. You lived in New Jersey
[01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:02.430]  and didn't realize I was a Ramsey? No, I'd
[01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:04.570]  never heard of it. Yeah, I lived there for two years.
[01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:05.610]  Shit. Wow.
[01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:08.250]  That's crazy. Oh, Eric said we should wrap up.
[01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:10.270]  Thank you for everybody
[01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:11.490]  for submitting your recipes.
[01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:14.410]  If you guys could send them to me
[01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:16.390]  in recipe form, I will
[01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:18.230]  make sure they go up on Instagram
[01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:19.790]  at some point, and hopefully,
[01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:22.350]  audience, if you guys want to give them a try, I know a lot
[01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:23.270]  of people made our sauces.
[01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:26.190]  Feel free, let us know how they are.
[01:12:26.290 --> 01:12:28.270]  I'm pretty sure mine's
[01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:30.250]  gonna work well, but I'll never know because I'm never gonna
[01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:30.990]  eat it or make it.
[01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:35.550]  Oh, and
[01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:37.550]  I guess we should end the podcast.
[01:12:37.690 --> 01:12:38.870]  Now, one last thing.
[01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:41.550]  Somebody asked me the other day what my progress on the
[01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:43.410]  Geoff achievement was, and so it is
[01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:45.330]  72%. That's where I am.
[01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:47.390]  You're getting close. Yeah, but I'm actually
[01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:48.530]  misleading.
[01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:51.070]  I am at 72%, but I'm in a much
[01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:52.910]  stronger place than that.
[01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:55.270]  I need about 1.8 million
[01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.990]  souls
[01:12:58.370 --> 01:12:59.170]  to spend
[01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:01.030]  on all the things I need to buy to upgrade.
[01:13:01.690 --> 01:13:03.470]  And I'm at like 1.2 million right now.
[01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:04.930]  So, uh...
[01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:07.590]  I don't have the metals I need, but I've
[01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:09.290]  spent some time just grinding out souls,
[01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:11.510]  and so I'm actually... I got enough souls
[01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:13.230]  for like 90%. Wow.
[01:13:13.330 --> 01:13:15.350]  How long will it take you to get that extra
[01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:17.250]  10%? What do you say? I have no idea.
[01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:19.530]  I should have this achievement
[01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:21.650]  within a year. So it's not like
[01:13:21.650 --> 01:13:23.710]  you can't consistently... What the fuck
[01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:25.010]  is going on? Stop.
[01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:27.450]  Shut up. Shut up.
[01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:29.350]  Everyone shut up.
[01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:31.530]  End the podcast. What's
[01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:32.770]  happening? You did it.
[01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:35.470]  You did the outro. And then now it's just
[01:13:35.470 --> 01:13:37.590]  questions about Gems of War. That could be the next episode.
[01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:39.570]  Well, no. We've got other stuff to talk about.
[01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:40.510]  No! Oh my god.
[01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:43.610]  I got notes. I got lots of notes.
[01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:45.630]  Well, most of them are for tomorrow, which is
[01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:47.510]  confusing, because it looks like more notes than that.
[01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:49.570]  Maybe I don't have a lot. Uh, anyway, thanks
[01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:50.970]  for listening to F*** Face. Bye!
[01:13:51.610 --> 01:13:53.550]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a
[01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:55.590]  look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:57.070]  Andrew has a new website.
[01:13:57.670 --> 01:13:59.270]  Let's look at Gavin's life hacks.
[01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:01.190]  Patton tries to make a grilled cheese
[01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:03.250]  at his desk. Salt licorice is
[01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:05.370]  the worst. Can you think of food shaped
[01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:07.030]  like animals? Geoff loves
[01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.410]  Bozo the Clown and defends Ronald McDonald's
[01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:11.210]  honor. What happened to the Grimace?
[01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:13.090]  Where did the cucumber come from?
[01:14:13.530 --> 01:14:15.250]  And once again, Andrew is
[01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.070]  a huge fan of the Annual Pass podcast.
[01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:19.550]  Available at YouTube.com slash Annual Pass.
