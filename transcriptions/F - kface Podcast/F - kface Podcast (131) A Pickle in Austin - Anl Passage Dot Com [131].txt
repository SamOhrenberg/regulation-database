[00:15.420 --> 00:20.180]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:20.840 --> 00:26.660]  I believe this is episode 131 of the fifth season.
[00:27.520 --> 00:31.580]  However, Eric said that the number doesn't really matter earlier for some reason,
[00:31.900 --> 00:33.860]  but we can say it at the beginning if we want to.
[00:34.340 --> 00:39.020]  I wanted to. With me, as always, Gavin and Andrew.
[00:39.220 --> 00:40.460]  How are you guys doing?
[00:40.460 --> 00:43.700]  Hello. I'm great. I need to make a clarification.
[00:44.040 --> 00:45.140]  First off, immediately.
[00:45.600 --> 00:46.960]  Do you need to make another rubbish apology?
[00:47.720 --> 00:49.400]  No, I don't. You do, actually.
[00:50.000 --> 00:50.960]  No, I don't. But I'm good.
[00:50.960 --> 00:51.560]  Yeah, you don't.
[00:51.900 --> 00:52.760]  So what happened?
[00:53.260 --> 00:55.500]  No. Last episode, he trashed a bunch.
[00:56.160 --> 00:57.860]  Listen, this is my...
[00:57.860 --> 00:58.620]  You little rubbish bin.
[00:59.080 --> 01:02.220]  No, listen, this is something else completely unrelated.
[01:02.880 --> 01:05.180]  I said that to celebrate the launch of the Gerpler,
[01:05.300 --> 01:07.460]  I would chug a thing of Bovril.
[01:07.460 --> 01:10.880]  I let people pick what I would chug out of the Gerpler.
[01:11.240 --> 01:13.760]  And I said I'd do Bovril because that was the number one voted item.
[01:14.100 --> 01:16.060]  I do not currently have access to the Gerpler.
[01:16.380 --> 01:18.480]  So this will be the next recording. I will do that.
[01:18.580 --> 01:20.820]  I just need to do a little bit of housekeeping.
[01:21.760 --> 01:23.820]  And now it's free to take it wherever you guys want.
[01:24.020 --> 01:26.620]  Just so you know, it's not the next recording we're recording to today,
[01:26.620 --> 01:28.180]  so it'll be in a few weeks.
[01:28.700 --> 01:30.200]  Yes. Thank you, Eric.
[01:30.340 --> 01:31.060]  Where's your Gerpler?
[01:31.540 --> 01:32.480]  It's in the mail.
[01:33.380 --> 01:34.440]  Oh, OK. You haven't got it yet.
[01:34.440 --> 01:38.520]  Dude, can I... I got to say, I filmed a little video on the Gerpler launch day
[01:38.520 --> 01:40.800]  of me like chugging a drink.
[01:41.400 --> 01:43.300]  I didn't realize that Gerpler is dangerous.
[01:44.060 --> 01:49.780]  It's got... I have the cups Jack stole from the pizza restaurant for me
[01:49.780 --> 01:52.480]  for my birthday, and those are like normal size.
[01:52.620 --> 01:53.980]  And that's what I've been kind of living out of.
[01:54.440 --> 01:55.580]  And I started drinking the Gerpler.
[01:55.700 --> 02:00.140]  I drank an entire Diet Pepsi in one gulp without even realizing it.
[02:00.240 --> 02:02.540]  That mouth is so wide, it just funnels.
[02:02.540 --> 02:06.520]  Like it's great responsibility and great power.
[02:06.940 --> 02:09.600]  Be careful when you wield the power of the Gerp.
[02:10.040 --> 02:14.880]  So is your drinking speed limited by the diameter of the opening of the receptacle?
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.560]  I didn't realize it until the Gerpler.
[02:17.760 --> 02:20.580]  But yeah, so probably, probably not most people.
[02:21.580 --> 02:22.560]  I'd be fucked.
[02:24.500 --> 02:26.220]  I should probably be a dog.
[02:26.380 --> 02:27.640]  I should probably only drink out of bowls.
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.960]  I, anyway, but I imagine most people are civilized.
[02:33.100 --> 02:38.220]  But if you're like me, I all of my civilized eating and drinking habits
[02:38.220 --> 02:42.340]  got ruined in the army by people yelling at me to speed up.
[02:42.460 --> 02:44.540]  And so and I never I never fixed that.
[02:44.620 --> 02:45.960]  I became an animal in the military.
[02:46.060 --> 02:47.960]  I think most people probably do when it comes to eating and drinking
[02:47.960 --> 02:49.340]  because of the way they make you do it.
[02:50.580 --> 02:55.760]  So, yeah, I'm only limited by the by the by the angle of my of my opening, I guess.
[02:55.760 --> 02:59.600]  So if you're like me and you're a degenerate who is in the military, be careful with the Gerpler.
[02:59.720 --> 03:01.000]  If you're a normal person, you're probably fine.
[03:01.700 --> 03:02.180]  Good to know.
[03:02.520 --> 03:03.140]  I'm so fascinated.
[03:03.240 --> 03:06.500]  I didn't realize that the size of the glass would impact a chug.
[03:06.900 --> 03:09.580]  It's a really, really good discovery to have.
[03:09.940 --> 03:14.040]  I I have a couple of little discoveries that I want to talk about with you guys
[03:14.040 --> 03:15.700]  over the course of the next two episodes.
[03:16.060 --> 03:20.000]  By the way, I feel like I am talking a mile a fucking minute.
[03:20.360 --> 03:21.840]  I am so excited.
[03:22.260 --> 03:24.600]  I am so goddamn excited.
[03:24.600 --> 03:28.660]  I realized that about two fifteen, I was just pacing around my house,
[03:28.800 --> 03:32.100]  going from room to room, just like looking at clocks
[03:32.100 --> 03:36.200]  and like fucking like tapping my legs and I couldn't slow down.
[03:36.380 --> 03:39.800]  I have no I don't know why because I don't particularly enjoy you guys.
[03:40.180 --> 03:44.880]  But I have been so excited to record today, like on fucking fire to record today.
[03:44.960 --> 03:47.120]  I guess it's because we haven't we all haven't talked in a while.
[03:47.500 --> 03:49.900]  But yeah, that was happens to me when it when we've had a gap.
[03:50.160 --> 03:51.380]  How long has it been? Two weeks?
[03:51.680 --> 03:53.320]  Yeah, two weeks, two weeks.
[03:53.320 --> 03:57.860]  God, three. Yeah, I feel I feel like one of those cars
[03:58.400 --> 04:00.880]  with like one of those little matchbox cars where you like
[04:02.580 --> 04:05.660]  you wind the wheel back a bunch, you drop it, it fucking takes off.
[04:05.980 --> 04:08.480]  I feel like I'm just like spinning in my seat right now.
[04:08.760 --> 04:10.760]  Andrew tweeted something terrifying.
[04:11.520 --> 04:13.300]  What? Oh, well, have you found it yet?
[04:13.820 --> 04:15.740]  And then he texts me saying, have you found it yet?
[04:16.320 --> 04:17.040]  I was just curious.
[04:17.520 --> 04:18.360]  What is this?
[04:18.360 --> 04:19.980]  Well, he tweeted, he tweeted,
[04:20.840 --> 04:23.440]  he tweeted a picture of a pickle in Austin
[04:23.440 --> 04:26.240]  by that mural of Austin.
[04:27.840 --> 04:28.980]  So he's got one of his...
[04:28.980 --> 04:29.900]  You want me to drop in the discord?
[04:30.120 --> 04:31.140]  You want to drop in the discord?
[04:31.460 --> 04:33.580]  If you've got if you've got it, you should post it.
[04:33.840 --> 04:37.040]  Absolutely. Got one of his little one of his little cronies
[04:37.040 --> 04:39.240]  to to take a picture with a pickle.
[04:39.600 --> 04:41.760]  And then he texts me, did you find it yet?
[04:42.600 --> 04:43.700]  And I haven't found it.
[04:43.740 --> 04:44.880]  And that's honestly scarier.
[04:45.760 --> 04:46.500]  Where is it?
[04:47.020 --> 04:48.420]  First of all, I think it's hilarious.
[04:48.580 --> 04:49.460]  You think it's one of my cronies.
[04:49.720 --> 04:52.320]  Second of all, I can't believe you haven't found it yet.
[04:52.860 --> 04:53.960]  You don't think it's me?
[04:54.320 --> 04:55.640]  Definitely not. Why?
[04:56.040 --> 04:57.260]  I don't think it's you either.
[04:57.720 --> 04:58.220]  That's great.
[04:59.020 --> 05:00.100]  Why do you not think it's me?
[05:00.720 --> 05:01.820]  Because you don't come here.
[05:02.120 --> 05:02.580]  You refuse.
[05:03.480 --> 05:04.860]  OK, that's funny.
[05:05.300 --> 05:06.520]  I'm just shocked you haven't found it.
[05:06.680 --> 05:08.400]  Have you looked like extensively?
[05:09.380 --> 05:10.580]  Well, where should I be looking?
[05:10.940 --> 05:11.820]  Like in the room?
[05:12.520 --> 05:14.060]  On the front porch? In the lawn?
[05:14.860 --> 05:18.780]  Well, you know, I'm going to be just snooping around like a crazy person.
[05:19.720 --> 05:21.720]  No, it's multiple places you could look.
[05:21.980 --> 05:24.080]  Well, you kind of know where I said I would leave it.
[05:24.140 --> 05:25.940]  So you can narrow it down a little bit.
[05:26.100 --> 05:26.760]  Wait, what did you say?
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.580]  Where the doorstep?
[05:28.800 --> 05:31.640]  Yeah. Yeah, the doorstep was the rule within regulation of there.
[05:32.060 --> 05:34.040]  Who's to say there's only one cucumber?
[05:34.200 --> 05:35.600]  You could be sitting on one right now.
[05:36.420 --> 05:37.400]  There could be one on your monitor.
[05:37.680 --> 05:38.160]  Let me check.
[05:39.260 --> 05:39.980]  No, no.
[05:40.060 --> 05:43.080]  I mean, I'm checking because I wouldn't I wouldn't put it past you.
[05:43.600 --> 05:46.560]  No. But you do this thing where you're so vague
[05:46.560 --> 05:50.480]  and you just do little proddy questions and it makes me want to curl up.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.380]  It's very funny that you don't think I'm there.
[05:53.360 --> 05:53.780]  That's great.
[05:54.380 --> 05:57.560]  As if you could you could barely get a set up going in your home,
[05:57.700 --> 05:59.820]  in your room, where you live.
[06:00.240 --> 06:04.320]  Can you imagine you pulling together a face recording set up in Austin?
[06:04.900 --> 06:10.940]  I can. Andrew, it takes you so long to get from your little island to us
[06:10.940 --> 06:14.620]  that if you got on your boat with the minute we stopped recording
[06:14.620 --> 06:16.840]  the last episode, I still don't think you'd be here.
[06:17.100 --> 06:17.720]  That's fair.
[06:18.520 --> 06:19.420]  That's totally fair.
[06:19.500 --> 06:20.940]  I'm just I'm surprised he hasn't found it.
[06:21.100 --> 06:23.620]  I was curious how long it would take Gavin to go into this
[06:24.340 --> 06:25.860]  paranoid cucumber situation.
[06:26.100 --> 06:27.580]  I'm glad we got into it immediately.
[06:27.780 --> 06:29.600]  Well, I don't stop thinking about it. What do you mean?
[06:31.060 --> 06:33.760]  It's there. I mean, it probably is going to start going bad.
[06:33.920 --> 06:36.500]  It's there. It's not. It is.
[06:37.940 --> 06:40.260]  Where? I told you.
[06:42.360 --> 06:43.680]  Oh, it's not there.
[06:44.040 --> 06:46.780]  Should he go look at this front porch right now, Andrew?
[06:46.900 --> 06:47.360]  Is that what you're saying?
[06:47.360 --> 06:48.680]  I mean, he can. I don't know.
[06:48.780 --> 06:50.000]  You know, could be hidden.
[06:50.340 --> 06:51.680]  Maybe I painted it. You don't.
[06:51.760 --> 06:55.100]  There's a lot of options that could be camouflaged and you don't even see it.
[06:55.840 --> 06:59.180]  There could be a little light on top of it, like one of those fish
[07:00.660 --> 07:01.660]  distracting you away.
[07:02.200 --> 07:05.340]  So it's an anglerfish cucumber.
[07:05.580 --> 07:07.120]  It could be all sorts of things.
[07:07.820 --> 07:08.820]  I could go and check now.
[07:09.300 --> 07:10.240]  You could if you wanted to.
[07:10.240 --> 07:11.580]  It'd be funny if you did.
[07:12.520 --> 07:13.540]  You go on my phone.
[07:13.700 --> 07:15.720]  I envision I envision.
[07:15.900 --> 07:19.400]  Do you guys ever watch the Pink Panther remakes with Steve Martin and John?
[07:19.560 --> 07:21.740]  No, they're pretty funny.
[07:21.960 --> 07:22.640]  They're pretty funny.
[07:22.880 --> 07:25.360]  But they would do this thing where they would blend into the background of a wall
[07:25.360 --> 07:27.920]  by wearing a suit that exactly matched the wall.
[07:28.140 --> 07:32.320]  I can just see like a brick or wooden shaped bodysuit
[07:32.320 --> 07:36.000]  around a fucking cucumber just leaned up against the step.
[07:36.380 --> 07:39.760]  I got detention and I don't know what year that would have been.
[07:39.760 --> 07:43.440]  Like maybe grade four or grade five, because my mom is like a special
[07:43.440 --> 07:46.640]  like lunch thing, included some gifts in my lunch.
[07:46.700 --> 07:49.020]  One of them was the Pink Panther, the movie book.
[07:49.240 --> 07:51.380]  And I don't remember if it was like details about the book,
[07:51.400 --> 07:53.180]  but there were photos from the movie in the book.
[07:53.320 --> 07:55.620]  And one of those photos was the wall thing.
[07:55.980 --> 07:57.940]  And I could not stop laughing.
[07:58.120 --> 07:59.140]  And it's like I couldn't.
[07:59.180 --> 08:02.320]  I was laughing so goddamn hard and I couldn't put it away.
[08:02.460 --> 08:03.860]  I just kept every page I flipped.
[08:03.960 --> 08:05.240]  Every photo would kill me more.
[08:05.460 --> 08:06.700]  I had this massive giggling fit.
[08:06.720 --> 08:08.880]  And I got detention because I was disrupting the class
[08:08.880 --> 08:11.240]  because I couldn't stop laughing at that specific.
[08:11.240 --> 08:12.480]  I can't believe you got in trouble.
[08:12.760 --> 08:15.700]  You got detention at a movie you'd never seen before.
[08:16.020 --> 08:17.420]  I don't think I'd seen it yet.
[08:17.480 --> 08:22.160]  I either had seen it or it was coming out and it was like a promotional book for it.
[08:22.320 --> 08:25.240]  But but it was surely not better than the Peter Sellers ones.
[08:26.100 --> 08:28.260]  No, no, no, definitely not.
[08:28.280 --> 08:29.260]  Nobody said that.
[08:29.580 --> 08:30.620]  OK, I'm just checking.
[08:30.700 --> 08:31.580]  I've never seen the new ones.
[08:32.460 --> 08:35.440]  I haven't seen them since they came out, but that's you've unlocked the memory,
[08:35.700 --> 08:38.520]  Geoff, of me in class just laughing at that fucking book.
[08:39.040 --> 08:41.180]  Oh, I'm glad I'm glad to help.
[08:41.280 --> 08:43.140]  I'm trying to fucking post a picture.
[08:43.600 --> 08:44.560]  Eric, no, I didn't check.
[08:44.620 --> 08:45.300]  I'm going to go check now.
[08:45.720 --> 08:46.560]  Is it too big, Geoff?
[08:46.600 --> 08:47.740]  Is that why you can't post the photo?
[08:48.220 --> 08:49.960]  No, I'm just an idiot.
[08:50.040 --> 08:51.560]  Oh, it's fucking tiny.
[08:52.120 --> 08:55.380]  Oh, it's too small.
[08:55.440 --> 08:56.580]  That would be an interesting dilemma.
[08:57.980 --> 08:59.140]  What if there's a range?
[09:01.580 --> 09:05.440]  Is it related to our conversation or is this setting up a new direction?
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.380]  No, it's just a picture of Jean-Blanc and Steve Martin in the in the bodysuit.
[09:12.460 --> 09:15.880]  Let me see if it's the exact photo they used in the 403 Forbidden.
[09:16.120 --> 09:17.240]  That's what happens when I click that.
[09:17.360 --> 09:18.560]  Are you fucking serious?
[09:19.140 --> 09:20.560]  Yes, for me here.
[09:20.900 --> 09:21.920]  Doesn't work for me.
[09:22.280 --> 09:24.480]  You got that secret Pink Panther access.
[09:24.660 --> 09:25.980]  I'm going to recreate it.
[09:26.100 --> 09:28.360]  Yeah, I'd love to see you recreate.
[09:28.380 --> 09:31.400]  No, I mean, I mean, take a screenshot, although that is an idea I had.
[09:31.440 --> 09:35.240]  I wanted to talk to you guys about which is us getting take trying to seriously
[09:35.240 --> 09:37.220]  recreate like iconic sports photos.
[09:37.660 --> 09:38.080]  Nothing there.
[09:39.980 --> 09:40.780]  OK, interesting.
[09:41.800 --> 09:42.340]  Here we go.
[09:43.020 --> 09:43.680]  Is that interesting?
[09:44.240 --> 09:45.040]  Yeah, it is.
[09:45.140 --> 09:46.420]  I can't believe you haven't found it.
[09:48.080 --> 09:50.200]  Oh, it's not the same photo, but that's a great one.
[09:50.320 --> 09:51.020]  That's just the one I found.
[09:51.520 --> 09:54.920]  Yeah, the one in the book was them like literally hugging the wall.
[09:54.960 --> 09:56.520]  The wall. Yeah, I couldn't find that one for some reason.
[09:57.000 --> 09:58.180]  So Jean Reno is great.
[09:58.640 --> 09:59.640]  What a fantastic actor.
[09:59.780 --> 10:01.180]  He's the best. He's he's fucking.
[10:01.460 --> 10:02.440]  Talk about versatility.
[10:03.140 --> 10:04.940]  Yeah. Oh, it's incredible.
[10:04.940 --> 10:07.080]  I love Godzilla. Professional.
[10:07.820 --> 10:08.480]  Mission Impossible.
[10:09.300 --> 10:11.140]  Wasabi. It's a great action movie of him.
[10:11.460 --> 10:12.820]  The fucking Pink Panther movies.
[10:13.260 --> 10:16.000]  He's fucking amazing in Leon.
[10:16.380 --> 10:18.680]  I guess you already said, yeah, he did.
[10:19.420 --> 10:21.000]  I have a I have a clip.
[10:21.080 --> 10:21.580]  Oh, you have a clip.
[10:21.680 --> 10:22.760]  Is it me saying trash?
[10:23.240 --> 10:24.780]  No. Oh, fuck.
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.200]  But hey, would you mind?
[10:27.300 --> 10:28.120]  Go ahead. Go ahead.
[10:28.160 --> 10:29.020]  Apologize for that one.
[10:29.040 --> 10:31.640]  And then just while you're at it, apologize for last week, too, please.
[10:32.260 --> 10:36.800]  Oh, I apologize for last week outside of saying trash multiple times.
[10:36.940 --> 10:38.980]  Well, I definitely have said it seven times here.
[10:39.140 --> 10:41.280]  Yeah. But I've already passed the limit.
[10:41.580 --> 10:43.440]  I guess I was saying trash can. Right.
[10:43.780 --> 10:47.640]  Because it was I was frustrated with Gavin questioning my sneakiness.
[10:48.200 --> 10:50.400]  Oh, Gavin is live, which is terrifying.
[10:51.420 --> 10:52.600]  He's questioning my sneakiness.
[10:52.660 --> 10:54.200]  So I said I'd steal his trash cans.
[10:54.640 --> 10:56.500]  So I guess I have to do something now. Right.
[10:56.620 --> 10:58.060]  What was the I have to start the marathon?
[10:59.300 --> 11:01.420]  OK, can you hear my audio?
[11:01.980 --> 11:04.320]  Let's see. On my when you're on my stream.
[11:04.960 --> 11:07.360]  Oh, no, I maybe I don't hear anything yet.
[11:07.920 --> 11:09.160]  Are you playing audio?
[11:09.600 --> 11:11.500]  Let me just start playing. Let's see if you can hear this.
[11:11.900 --> 11:12.500]  Yep. Yeah.
[11:13.520 --> 11:15.480]  You got that? Yeah. Yeah. I got it.
[11:15.800 --> 11:17.860]  All right. Here's my clip. It's how long is this?
[11:18.280 --> 11:19.220]  Oh, it's about a minute and a half.
[11:19.660 --> 11:21.660]  Oh, here we go. You ready?
[11:22.000 --> 11:23.560]  Everyone ready? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[11:23.640 --> 11:26.180]  I guess we all didn't realize what we were making
[11:26.180 --> 11:27.980]  when he pulled out all the mic equipment.
[11:28.580 --> 11:29.060]  What do you mean?
[11:29.340 --> 11:30.380]  We all didn't.
[11:30.400 --> 11:34.180]  Are you saying you didn't realize and you're saying we all didn't realize
[11:34.180 --> 11:37.220]  that was confusion when you brought out all the XLR cables and real mics?
[11:37.460 --> 11:38.960]  I think you were confused.
[11:39.200 --> 11:40.240]  Is that what you mean?
[11:40.740 --> 11:42.600]  There's no way Geoff wasn't also confused.
[11:42.960 --> 11:46.580]  Hi, welcome to the supplementary episode of F*** Face.
[11:46.700 --> 11:48.520]  We've gotten together at Geoff's house to cook these pizzas.
[11:48.660 --> 11:50.200]  This is how you set the scene.
[11:50.260 --> 11:52.540]  But this is like 20 minutes into the pizza video, isn't it?
[11:52.560 --> 11:53.440]  Is this a separate thing?
[11:53.440 --> 11:57.020]  Are we not releasing audio of this?
[11:57.800 --> 11:58.980]  As an audio podcast?
[11:59.600 --> 12:02.800]  Oh, are you for real?
[12:03.120 --> 12:04.820]  This is why he produces.
[12:05.440 --> 12:07.040]  It's an audio podcast.
[12:07.940 --> 12:11.360]  I mean, I remember there being a conversation about that equipment
[12:11.360 --> 12:12.660]  coming to the episode.
[12:12.960 --> 12:14.360]  I mean, I think we went over that at the time.
[12:14.460 --> 12:14.980]  Yeah, that's fine.
[12:15.100 --> 12:16.260]  I thought we were I thought we were really.
[12:16.400 --> 12:17.500]  That's fine. Doesn't matter.
[12:17.880 --> 12:20.080]  Gavin, Gavin, what can I do in the future?
[12:20.540 --> 12:22.580]  What can I do in the future to help you?
[12:22.580 --> 12:24.400]  Eric, this is not a you problem.
[12:24.660 --> 12:25.500]  This is a me problem.
[12:25.680 --> 12:28.660]  But I think it was also a Geoff problem briefly.
[12:29.220 --> 12:32.660]  Yeah, but if it was, I rolled with the punches very quickly.
[12:35.180 --> 12:37.600]  I like the way you pose this or you went.
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.560]  Yeah. And then you brought out the equipment and we were all.
[12:47.300 --> 12:48.000]  That's my clip.
[12:48.500 --> 12:49.960]  That's a fantastic clip.
[12:50.660 --> 12:51.400]  That's a great clip.
[12:51.460 --> 12:52.360]  I don't need to listen to it again.
[12:52.360 --> 12:53.660]  No more, please.
[12:53.720 --> 12:54.500]  Once is enough.
[12:55.820 --> 12:57.180]  That's a great clip, Gavin.
[12:57.780 --> 12:59.880]  I mean, I was just vibing in the moment.
[13:01.020 --> 13:03.920]  OK, everybody starts to go, oh, you jump in, right?
[13:04.420 --> 13:06.360]  Trying. I'm trying to make you feel less uncomfortable
[13:06.360 --> 13:09.240]  because I can see you're about to crash the plane, you know,
[13:10.700 --> 13:12.120]  or it's entirely possible.
[13:12.300 --> 13:14.260]  I'm just a lying hypocrite. I don't know.
[13:16.480 --> 13:17.400]  One of them is funnier.
[13:20.060 --> 13:22.860]  That is the other audio you were hearing there.
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.860]  If it hasn't come out yet, it's from our pizza video, which isn't out yet.
[13:29.440 --> 13:31.400]  I know. I don't think the pizza video will be out.
[13:31.520 --> 13:34.060]  I think Nick is still in the process of editing that.
[13:34.180 --> 13:35.240]  Nick, is that great? Is it?
[13:35.360 --> 13:37.180]  Yes. He is in the middle of editing that right now.
[13:37.980 --> 13:40.300]  So it's I don't know if you know, it's hefty.
[13:40.440 --> 13:42.880]  Even with Emily stopping recording in the middle.
[13:43.560 --> 13:44.460]  Still quite a bit.
[13:48.520 --> 13:50.980]  Emily pulled an action Bronson there. That was awesome.
[13:51.300 --> 13:53.780]  If there was any bit from that day to film,
[13:54.040 --> 13:56.740]  that was the bit that she stopped filming for.
[13:58.300 --> 14:02.780]  But I finished my cut of the process, the making of the pizza.
[14:02.920 --> 14:05.340]  That's on Google Drive for the notes.
[14:05.640 --> 14:06.940]  Oh, great. That's awesome.
[14:07.580 --> 14:08.900]  Yeah, I'll say.
[14:09.100 --> 14:10.820]  And I was going to I figured we would talk about this
[14:10.820 --> 14:14.160]  more in depth during sausage talk tomorrow because I believe
[14:14.780 --> 14:15.740]  there's so much going on.
[14:15.960 --> 14:17.140]  We're doing office day tomorrow.
[14:17.280 --> 14:19.640]  It'll be our third office day and we're going to record,
[14:19.800 --> 14:20.880]  I think, a sausage talk.
[14:21.060 --> 14:25.640]  And then we were talking about one or two pieces of supplemental content as well.
[14:26.080 --> 14:27.460]  Andrew, you wanted to do.
[14:28.380 --> 14:30.940]  Well, just briefly, just to be something to look forward to.
[14:30.980 --> 14:32.700]  We wanted to do like an end of the year wrap up
[14:32.700 --> 14:34.460]  where we talk about like our favorite things from the year,
[14:34.540 --> 14:35.980]  which I thought was a bad idea.
[14:36.180 --> 14:40.000]  And I wasn't into until I started coming up with my favorite stuff of the year.
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.100]  And then I got quite you said
[14:41.960 --> 14:45.420]  you said there is nothing worth mentioning for this year
[14:45.420 --> 14:49.220]  as far as good things happening to you on the year you got fucking engaged.
[14:49.380 --> 14:51.220]  You got engaged like two weeks ago.
[14:51.460 --> 14:52.620]  Listen, I got engaged.
[14:52.720 --> 14:54.180]  I got engaged. That was number one.
[14:54.180 --> 14:56.040]  Number two, we'll get we'll get into it tomorrow.
[14:56.320 --> 15:01.440]  There was good things about 2022, but it was largely a dog shit year.
[15:01.940 --> 15:02.200]  That's fair.
[15:02.440 --> 15:05.800]  And not the least of which, because two of my dogs died this year.
[15:05.800 --> 15:11.320]  Uh, when I say I realize how fucking like how on the nose that dog shit comment.
[15:12.660 --> 15:17.060]  But but then again, I haven't had I haven't been covered in dog shit in 11 months.
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.500]  So that's a I guess that is kind of a nice side effect,
[15:22.940 --> 15:25.680]  which is the first time I could say that in like five years.
[15:25.940 --> 15:29.500]  Yeah, you had a significant bike crash as well this year.
[15:29.620 --> 15:32.400]  Oh, dude, I had the jock itch for six months.
[15:32.500 --> 15:34.440]  My daughter's surgery was so fucking.
[15:34.920 --> 15:37.760]  I had the the fucking gum thing.
[15:38.320 --> 15:39.620]  I got covered.
[15:39.820 --> 15:43.920]  I had three vacations canceled because of fucking illnesses and shit.
[15:43.920 --> 15:45.680]  It was like it was just one thing.
[15:45.940 --> 15:47.480]  You are there. You do.
[15:48.140 --> 15:50.780]  I got fucking three car to car crashes this year.
[15:53.340 --> 15:56.380]  It was never in the never.
[15:56.800 --> 16:01.040]  But anyway, so we're going to cover like the best of the year tomorrow.
[16:01.040 --> 16:02.380]  And then I think we're going to do this
[16:02.380 --> 16:06.240]  ladder tournament idea of funny clips that Andrew has that we're going to try.
[16:06.560 --> 16:07.580]  So we've got that coming tomorrow.
[16:08.020 --> 16:12.020]  I bring that up because in the last episode, I think there was some confusion.
[16:12.220 --> 16:16.200]  We thought maybe the monkey or pizza video would be out already.
[16:16.200 --> 16:19.000]  And the audience was wondering if they missed it or not.
[16:19.360 --> 16:20.260]  It's not the case.
[16:20.340 --> 16:25.060]  It's just the reality of having to record around holidays
[16:25.060 --> 16:28.360]  and vacations is that we have to batch record in advance.
[16:28.910 --> 16:32.300]  And when we do that, sometimes we miss the mark on when stuff's going to get edited.
[16:32.980 --> 16:35.340]  We were talking about two videos as if they were both out.
[16:35.460 --> 16:36.420]  And as if they were both out.
[16:36.960 --> 16:38.040]  Yeah, neither of them are out.
[16:38.220 --> 16:42.960]  But that's also a side effect of us loving and prioritizing
[16:42.960 --> 16:47.260]  Face to such a degree in the last few months that we have been
[16:48.420 --> 16:50.620]  knocking ancillary content out of the park.
[16:50.880 --> 16:55.880]  We've been filming stuff left and right, which is and there's still only one Nick,
[16:55.880 --> 17:00.200]  you know, and so, you know, we wanted Nick to obviously Nick wanted
[17:00.200 --> 17:01.660]  to have a Thanksgiving as well.
[17:02.200 --> 17:06.220]  And so stuff's just going to take a little longer to come out
[17:06.220 --> 17:09.580]  because, you know, we're we're creating more shit.
[17:09.940 --> 17:15.500]  And I don't think who even knows how much stuff will schedule in March of 2023
[17:15.500 --> 17:17.160]  that won't be recorded until October.
[17:17.620 --> 17:19.380]  There could be so many things.
[17:19.520 --> 17:20.820]  That's an excellent point.
[17:20.840 --> 17:22.480]  Also, I should mention Kelly edits for us, too.
[17:22.540 --> 17:24.340]  I don't want to leave Kelly out. Very true. Yeah.
[17:25.540 --> 17:28.620]  Although Eric says Monkey Movie is out by the time this is, yes, monkey.
[17:28.860 --> 17:30.240]  We're recording on Thursday.
[17:30.400 --> 17:32.620]  Monkey Movie comes out tomorrow for first.
[17:32.740 --> 17:34.380]  But by the time this is out, Monkey Movie's out.
[17:34.440 --> 17:35.600]  So you can go check it out. Go.
[17:36.020 --> 17:39.720]  You get you get two pieces of content staggered in release.
[17:39.880 --> 17:41.540]  If that matters to you in some way.
[17:41.780 --> 17:47.300]  First, it will be Andrew's PowerPoint presentation complete with banana wipe.
[17:47.320 --> 17:52.660]  And then you'll get the watch along of MVP to a movie that is about ice hockey
[17:52.660 --> 17:56.020]  and apparently skateboarding.
[17:56.240 --> 17:57.840]  So check them both out.
[17:57.940 --> 18:00.280]  They're out now on Rooster Teeth, wherever you get podcasts.
[18:00.540 --> 18:02.700]  But you should probably go on like the YouTube because you can sync it up.
[18:03.060 --> 18:03.520]  Go on our YouTube.
[18:03.520 --> 18:07.260]  And then after that, as much as I thought it was going to be one video,
[18:07.340 --> 18:11.220]  we have two pizza videos, two pizza videos.
[18:12.280 --> 18:17.180]  Well, you just listed a list of terrible things that happened to you this year, Geoff.
[18:17.220 --> 18:22.300]  Could I make a maybe a possibly late entry into a favorite thing of the year for you?
[18:22.300 --> 18:23.820]  Something I've been working on.
[18:23.880 --> 18:24.760]  Uh, last few days.
[18:24.880 --> 18:28.140]  Yeah. But is that something that we should do now or do we do it tomorrow?
[18:28.140 --> 18:30.600]  In the in the. No, no, no. It'll be now.
[18:30.740 --> 18:34.400]  It needs to be placed now for you to consider it for tomorrow.
[18:34.480 --> 18:36.880]  I don't know if it'll make the list. Oh, I see. I see.
[18:37.120 --> 18:39.760]  So I've been I was curious because we're at the end of the year
[18:39.760 --> 18:43.160]  and one of my favorite bits of the year that the audience
[18:43.160 --> 18:45.980]  that we really have to credit them as well as Gavin's inability to see
[18:45.980 --> 18:50.380]  is anal passage becoming the number one selling shirt in the store.
[18:50.500 --> 18:51.600]  It's just absurd.
[18:51.600 --> 18:52.600]  It's hilarious to me.
[18:52.780 --> 18:56.940]  The concept that there would be meetings with like professional people
[18:56.940 --> 18:59.560]  that are so far away from us that like don't understand
[18:59.560 --> 19:03.900]  or like have any context for face having to look at charts
[19:03.900 --> 19:08.280]  where face anal passage is number one, like you can't ignore it.
[19:08.460 --> 19:10.840]  Like it has to be there. Just kills me.
[19:10.940 --> 19:12.220]  It makes me laugh. So it's great.
[19:12.340 --> 19:15.140]  It is genuinely one of my favorite things of the year.
[19:15.500 --> 19:18.560]  And so I was curious because I hadn't checked in in a while.
[19:18.560 --> 19:22.880]  So I reached out to the merch department to make sure that we were still number one.
[19:22.920 --> 19:25.700]  And sadly, we have fallen to number two.
[19:25.860 --> 19:28.760]  It is the number two selling shirt by a little bit.
[19:28.820 --> 19:32.880]  So I've been trying to reignite the anal passage brand
[19:32.880 --> 19:37.280]  to kind of close up the air and hopefully get us back on top that anal passage pyramid.
[19:37.520 --> 19:38.920]  So I did some research.
[19:39.120 --> 19:40.740]  I did some digging climbing that anal mountain.
[19:41.420 --> 19:45.860]  I climbed that anal mountain and I made something as the first step
[19:45.860 --> 19:49.960]  and bringing the brand back to the top of anal mountain where it deserves to be.
[19:50.320 --> 19:53.660]  Geoff, let me introduce you to anal passage dot com,
[19:53.680 --> 19:58.620]  a new website for a serious brand for serious people.
[20:00.380 --> 20:01.840]  Oh, my God.
[20:02.440 --> 20:04.460]  He looks like a serial killer.
[20:07.240 --> 20:08.800]  So the passages.
[20:09.560 --> 20:12.860]  So, yes, we've done a few things on the site as you see open it.
[20:12.920 --> 20:14.400]  Wonderful Jack's face on it.
[20:14.440 --> 20:15.320]  Welcome to anal passage.
[20:15.320 --> 20:17.220]  It's available, obviously, to anyone listening.
[20:17.360 --> 20:18.540]  You can go on anal passage dot com.
[20:18.720 --> 20:20.500]  We got the home. We got the FAQ.
[20:20.600 --> 20:22.260]  We got the top ten passages. We got more.
[20:22.360 --> 20:23.020]  Where are you at, Gavin?
[20:23.080 --> 20:24.120]  You're at the top ten passages.
[20:24.180 --> 20:25.080]  The top ten passages.
[20:26.220 --> 20:27.600]  Ten famous passages.
[20:27.840 --> 20:29.140]  Let's open up the top ten passages.
[20:29.560 --> 20:31.320]  I don't think there's any dispute for what these are.
[20:31.920 --> 20:35.760]  Brooklyn Bridge in Brooklyn and Rainbow Bridge in Ascot.
[20:36.040 --> 20:37.280]  Well, you're skipping number one.
[20:37.540 --> 20:38.340]  Kevin McAllister's zip line.
[20:39.140 --> 20:42.800]  Kevin McAllister's zip line is maybe my favorite passage of all time.
[20:42.980 --> 20:43.400]  Where'd you get that from?
[20:43.900 --> 20:44.600]  What do you mean?
[20:44.600 --> 20:45.500]  The zip line?
[20:45.940 --> 20:48.380]  Yeah, what made you put that on there?
[20:48.460 --> 20:51.560]  Well, it's just when I was thinking of like defining what a passage is.
[20:51.620 --> 20:54.840]  It's essentially like a path over or around or through something.
[20:55.260 --> 20:58.800]  And the zip line as a kid, I thought that was so fucking cool.
[20:59.080 --> 21:01.400]  You have a zip line from your bedroom to the treehouse.
[21:01.520 --> 21:02.360]  Like it's just it's amazing.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.960]  You're overlooking number one, which is hole six at the Paradise Swamp Park,
[21:06.020 --> 21:08.520]  which is a mini golf course on the island.
[21:08.940 --> 21:10.700]  You walk on a pirate ship. It's very cool.
[21:10.820 --> 21:11.580]  It's a great one. On your island?
[21:11.940 --> 21:12.680]  Yeah, on our island.
[21:12.680 --> 21:14.660]  Oh, we got to play mini golf on your island!
[21:15.300 --> 21:17.900]  You can see Paradise Swamp Park.
[21:18.480 --> 21:20.120]  It's not, it's honestly, it's OK.
[21:20.740 --> 21:21.160]  But that ring.
[21:21.340 --> 21:26.180]  A load of anal passage shirts to the number one top ten passage in the world.
[21:26.400 --> 21:27.140]  We've got to.
[21:27.660 --> 21:29.480]  We can have a little sell off at the end of the year.
[21:29.620 --> 21:30.760]  We'll do it when we go crabbing.
[21:31.220 --> 21:33.560]  So I guess for the audio listeners, just go through hole six.
[21:33.660 --> 21:36.480]  Paradise Swamp Park is number one, followed by Brooklyn Bridge two.
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.520]  Rainbow Bridge three is Asgard.
[21:38.980 --> 21:40.960]  Number four is Kevin McAllister's zip line.
[21:40.960 --> 21:42.660]  Number five, Golden Gate Bridge.
[21:43.040 --> 21:46.400]  Number six, Hawaii Door, which is a door in Monsters, Inc.
[21:46.440 --> 21:48.160]  with a time code of where you could find it.
[21:48.560 --> 21:51.580]  Number seven is the path to becoming John Malkovich.
[21:51.940 --> 21:54.640]  Number eight, the Staples Center secret entrance,
[21:54.920 --> 21:56.540]  which I don't know if you're familiar with, Gavin,
[21:56.900 --> 22:00.920]  but there's a player who played for that team, got traded, got into.
[22:01.040 --> 22:02.600]  They had like a fight on the court.
[22:02.740 --> 22:06.600]  And the guy that got traded that used to play there led a group of players
[22:06.600 --> 22:09.340]  through a secret entrance in the bowels of the arena
[22:09.340 --> 22:11.660]  to try to attack the other team in the locker room.
[22:11.700 --> 22:12.260]  It's fantastic.
[22:12.520 --> 22:17.340]  By the way, this player who he's mentioning is State Farm's own Chris Paul.
[22:18.860 --> 22:23.580]  Number nine is the Shawshank Tunnels and the Mines of Moray, Middle Earth.
[22:23.940 --> 22:25.120]  Number ten, so that's a top ten.
[22:26.900 --> 22:31.820]  The Golden Gate Bridge ranks above a tunnel leading to the brain of another human.
[22:32.580 --> 22:33.560]  Yeah, it's a great bridge.
[22:33.860 --> 22:35.420]  I don't know if you've seen it. It's a really nice bridge.
[22:35.460 --> 22:36.560]  It looks really nice.
[22:36.560 --> 22:39.520]  It's in so many movies, it always pops when it's in a movie.
[22:39.620 --> 22:40.220]  It's fantastic.
[22:40.380 --> 22:42.280]  That color, international orange, lovely.
[22:42.880 --> 22:44.160]  So where should we move to next?
[22:44.440 --> 22:46.120]  I guess more future innovations.
[22:46.580 --> 22:49.340]  OK, so future innovations is because if we're a serious brand,
[22:49.380 --> 22:51.500]  we can't just stop at a shirt. Oh, Lord.
[22:51.920 --> 22:55.440]  So I reached out to Tony, who's fantastic in merch,
[22:55.600 --> 22:58.440]  and I ran some ideas by him and had him make some things.
[22:58.500 --> 23:00.760]  You've had people put time on this.
[23:01.200 --> 23:02.500]  Tony is incredible.
[23:03.360 --> 23:04.980]  Some of the products here are fantastic.
[23:04.980 --> 23:06.880]  We could go through the first one.
[23:07.540 --> 23:08.420]  Anal baggage.
[23:08.800 --> 23:11.560]  It's a bag. It's being currently used to cover a jet ski.
[23:13.000 --> 23:14.500]  It's, you know, you can use it however you want that.
[23:14.560 --> 23:15.620]  We all have anal baggage.
[23:16.540 --> 23:17.580]  There's the toy.
[23:17.660 --> 23:18.760]  I don't remember what those are called.
[23:18.860 --> 23:19.960]  What's on the viewfinder?
[23:20.520 --> 23:21.500]  Yeah, I don't know.
[23:21.620 --> 23:22.660]  We can finalize that.
[23:23.100 --> 23:23.240]  OK.
[23:24.980 --> 23:27.620]  Got the anal passage age appropriate toy.
[23:28.060 --> 23:32.840]  We got the anal passage of time, which is a clock anybody can use.
[23:32.840 --> 23:34.420]  We've got to sell that!
[23:35.240 --> 23:36.620]  We've got to sell that!
[23:38.640 --> 23:40.080]  Can we please sell it?
[23:40.100 --> 23:41.480]  A passage of time clock.
[23:41.840 --> 23:43.900]  We got like 21 items here.
[23:44.080 --> 23:45.660]  I want to make one so I can have it.
[23:45.980 --> 23:49.580]  Yeah. Oh, we have the anal passage of enlightenment, which is a great pet toy.
[23:49.760 --> 23:52.980]  You can crawl through there, have fun, create your own anal passages.
[23:53.160 --> 23:56.420]  Some might just call it a journal, but I think you can create your own.
[23:57.440 --> 24:00.680]  Anal pass in fruit is a beverage flavor.
[24:00.680 --> 24:03.000]  We have a possible sparkling water beverage.
[24:03.440 --> 24:04.760]  Anal passion fruit.
[24:06.440 --> 24:11.080]  Using your vernacular, Gavin, we've got some running shoes that were called trainers.
[24:11.320 --> 24:12.280]  We got anal trainers.
[24:12.960 --> 24:16.320]  If you need a hat to block out the sun, we have anal cappage.
[24:17.860 --> 24:19.480]  We have a pillow if you need to sleep.
[24:19.580 --> 24:22.920]  Anal passage, because you're falling asleep.
[24:24.400 --> 24:27.200]  We have a baseball, so that'd be anal smasage,
[24:27.360 --> 24:29.200]  because there's no better thing to hit fingers with
[24:29.720 --> 24:31.300]  than the anal smasage.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.320]  The baseball is great.
[24:36.500 --> 24:39.820]  We got an anal passage, an anal passage measure,
[24:40.020 --> 24:43.540]  because it's very important to have the specifics of the size of the passage
[24:43.540 --> 24:44.720]  that you're dealing with.
[24:45.140 --> 24:47.940]  Then we just have the lazily named anal passage bomber jacket.
[24:48.020 --> 24:48.940]  I couldn't think of a funny name.
[24:49.020 --> 24:50.320]  I just thought it looked fucking awesome.
[24:50.420 --> 24:51.160]  I thought that looked great.
[24:51.540 --> 24:55.640]  And closing out our lineup is anal issues past the tissues.
[24:55.640 --> 24:59.520]  A Kleenex box sponsored by anal passage.
[25:01.200 --> 25:03.720]  So your theory is if we sell some of this stuff,
[25:03.840 --> 25:05.640]  we'll become the number one item of the year?
[25:05.980 --> 25:08.700]  Well, no, you know, we also have to join the team where if you click,
[25:08.780 --> 25:11.060]  it will go to a link of buying the shirt in the store.
[25:11.380 --> 25:12.600]  I should also mention.
[25:12.820 --> 25:14.820]  I didn't realize we were still selling this thing.
[25:15.080 --> 25:16.440]  The shirt is still available.
[25:16.880 --> 25:18.080]  I'm working on a testimonial.
[25:18.500 --> 25:23.180]  So if anyone wants to send a testimonial video to me of them wearing the shirt,
[25:23.180 --> 25:26.900]  talking about how how it has changed your life, becoming an anal passer,
[25:27.500 --> 25:30.400]  email me at Andrew at anal passage dot com.
[25:30.480 --> 25:32.040]  That is a totally real email.
[25:32.040 --> 25:34.420]  And I am working on getting a video together.
[25:34.900 --> 25:36.780]  So please feel free to send a submission.
[25:37.300 --> 25:41.320]  I see you're also looking for the perfect fit for a celebrity endorsement.
[25:41.800 --> 25:42.780]  I am. Yeah.
[25:42.800 --> 25:45.680]  So I remembered a long, long time ago,
[25:46.320 --> 25:48.860]  Macaulay Culkin wore a rooster teeth shirt.
[25:48.920 --> 25:49.940]  So I tweeted to him.
[25:50.260 --> 25:51.400]  Didn't get a response.
[25:51.400 --> 25:52.180]  So we're still working.
[25:52.480 --> 25:53.960]  Oh, we're still out there.
[25:54.240 --> 25:57.400]  We're trying to get Macaulay Culkin to wear an anal passage.
[25:57.600 --> 25:59.760]  Well, he wore a Captain Dynamic shirt.
[25:59.920 --> 26:03.080]  So he's really rebounded since that point, I think.
[26:03.740 --> 26:05.980]  Oh, you think that that was a better place now?
[26:06.420 --> 26:09.200]  Damn. Oh, yeah, I tried.
[26:09.660 --> 26:10.680]  So we're still in the running.
[26:10.760 --> 26:11.800]  But feel free to email me.
[26:11.860 --> 26:13.400]  Andrew at anal passage dot com.
[26:13.480 --> 26:14.820]  Just glance the frequently asked questions.
[26:14.900 --> 26:15.480]  There's only three.
[26:15.880 --> 26:16.720]  Yeah. First question.
[26:16.800 --> 26:19.720]  Why? Because a serious brand deserves a serious website.
[26:19.720 --> 26:21.400]  Second question, what is anal passage?
[26:22.040 --> 26:23.320]  Anal passage is a way of life.
[26:23.640 --> 26:25.660]  Three. Do you even like theme parks?
[26:26.040 --> 26:27.560]  I don't understand this question.
[26:28.120 --> 26:29.160]  I thought it was odd to ask.
[26:30.020 --> 26:31.340]  But you asked it of yourself.
[26:31.960 --> 26:34.380]  Well, you know, listen, so I've heard questions about it.
[26:34.580 --> 26:36.560]  I'm just responding to the questions that people have.
[26:37.620 --> 26:39.040]  So that is my anal passage submission.
[26:39.360 --> 26:40.180]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[26:40.240 --> 26:43.520]  I hope it is in consideration, maybe one of your favorite things of the year.
[26:44.520 --> 26:45.260]  I hope the audience...
[26:45.260 --> 26:48.960]  I'm blown away at how actually good some of those fake products look.
[26:48.960 --> 26:50.600]  Yeah, they look great.
[26:50.720 --> 26:51.380]  That baseball.
[26:51.640 --> 26:53.500]  Like that baseball and that cloak. Amazing.
[26:54.040 --> 26:57.000]  Honestly, the the jet ski cover is not bad either.
[26:57.800 --> 27:01.380]  It's just it's such a what I like about that is it's such a niche product.
[27:01.740 --> 27:04.220]  Yeah. The concept of a jet ski cover like nobody.
[27:04.820 --> 27:08.020]  I would bet less than three people that listen to this have a jet ski.
[27:08.840 --> 27:12.900]  Hey, if you listen to F*** Face and you own a jet ski,
[27:13.020 --> 27:16.000]  can you email Andrew at anal passage dot com and let him know?
[27:16.340 --> 27:18.940]  I'd love to get a I'd love to get a tally going.
[27:18.940 --> 27:23.520]  Of how many jet ski owners we have in the fray as a jet ski enthusiast
[27:23.520 --> 27:26.520]  to myself and aficionado, I'd love to connect with others out there.
[27:26.760 --> 27:28.720]  Just out of curiosity. That's all.
[27:29.500 --> 27:35.120]  Do we know how many times the anal passage shirt outsold the annual pass shirt?
[27:35.380 --> 27:36.340]  Is that a stat that we know?
[27:36.980 --> 27:39.640]  I do not. Because that's probably a win in itself.
[27:40.540 --> 27:41.460]  Oh, my God.
[27:42.220 --> 27:45.960]  Do you know how many jet skiing participants there were in the United States
[27:45.960 --> 27:49.240]  in 2017? That's the most recent they have data for.
[27:49.560 --> 27:50.680]  Five point two million.
[27:51.400 --> 27:53.980]  Wow. Bigger than more than I would have anticipated.
[27:54.160 --> 27:55.180]  Yeah, that's a big number.
[27:55.580 --> 27:57.240]  What what? What do you throw in this?
[27:57.940 --> 28:01.160]  The one of the UNO shirts. Yeah, it was during the age.
[28:02.760 --> 28:04.700]  Bummer. Yeah, it is a bummer.
[28:04.720 --> 28:08.700]  But I hope I'm hoping if you buy the shirt because of this
[28:08.700 --> 28:11.080]  and you want to be in the testimony, I'm going to wait a little bit
[28:11.080 --> 28:12.000]  before putting that together.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.960]  So you will have time to submit a video if you want to.
[28:13.960 --> 28:16.900]  It is. The show is available in extra medium, of course.
[28:17.040 --> 28:19.020]  It is. Is it?
[28:20.120 --> 28:23.840]  Is it? Are we within striking distance or do we like how?
[28:23.980 --> 28:25.120]  How tall is Anel Mountain?
[28:25.320 --> 28:27.620]  Listen, I Anel Mountain is pretty tall.
[28:27.820 --> 28:29.080]  It's there's a little bit of a gap.
[28:29.160 --> 28:32.780]  I would be it would be even more ridiculous
[28:32.780 --> 28:35.320]  if we were able to pass that point.
[28:35.360 --> 28:37.080]  But I just I want to get as close as possible.
[28:37.360 --> 28:39.460]  And I want to at least solidify us in the top three
[28:39.460 --> 28:41.600]  because we're a little close to the three.
[28:41.700 --> 28:43.480]  So as long as I top three, I'm happy with.
[28:43.480 --> 28:46.880]  But if we could reclaim number one, that'd be fucking ridiculous.
[28:47.100 --> 28:51.220]  I will say as a as a as an emerging brand, we had a lot of anal heat
[28:51.220 --> 28:53.160]  earlier in the year when we launched that thing.
[28:53.240 --> 28:56.400]  And we really did kind of just let it die on the vine as a
[28:56.400 --> 28:57.820]  as the year went on.
[28:58.040 --> 28:58.900]  Really, we got it.
[28:59.360 --> 29:00.740]  You got it. You got to feed the beast.
[29:02.100 --> 29:05.420]  The thing with it was we didn't expect it to exist for long.
[29:05.460 --> 29:07.580]  It was supposed to be like a kind of a throwaway joke
[29:07.580 --> 29:09.760]  that once Jack noticed, we'd we'd remove.
[29:09.960 --> 29:13.300]  Yeah. And then it became so big that we couldn't remove it.
[29:13.300 --> 29:13.980]  It was just fun.
[29:14.080 --> 29:15.260]  And it was such a great shirt.
[29:15.640 --> 29:17.180]  That's right. He wanted us to take it down.
[29:17.260 --> 29:18.940]  But it was it was the number one selling.
[29:19.140 --> 29:20.120]  It was the number one.
[29:20.180 --> 29:22.560]  So like, how do you take down the number of selling shirts?
[29:22.800 --> 29:24.340]  That's funny. Yeah.
[29:24.480 --> 29:26.160]  It suddenly started paying salaries.
[29:29.860 --> 29:32.120]  So that is anal passage dot com.
[29:32.180 --> 29:32.920]  That is magic.
[29:33.380 --> 29:35.040]  You're a you're a treat, man.
[29:35.260 --> 29:36.940]  That's the best site you've made so far.
[29:37.760 --> 29:39.260]  I think so. It's up there.
[29:39.360 --> 29:42.520]  I owe a lot to Tony and my friends as well with helping me coming up
[29:42.520 --> 29:44.320]  with product names as fantastic.
[29:45.280 --> 29:48.320]  So how long did Tony spend on that?
[29:48.640 --> 29:51.300]  Not shockingly, not like I was.
[29:51.380 --> 29:52.400]  I messaged Tony.
[29:52.500 --> 29:53.540]  It was like 11.
[29:54.120 --> 29:57.260]  It's probably like 1130 when I messaged him.
[29:57.460 --> 29:58.660]  And I was like, hey, this is ridiculous.
[29:59.160 --> 30:00.760]  If you don't want to do this, you're too busy.
[30:00.860 --> 30:01.460]  Totally understand.
[30:02.000 --> 30:03.000]  I have these ideas.
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.300]  I suggested the anal passage of time,
[30:05.820 --> 30:10.080]  the anal tunnel of enlightenment and the create your own anal passages.
[30:10.720 --> 30:13.240]  I was like, could you maybe put some branding on these?
[30:13.820 --> 30:16.140]  And he's like, yeah, I'll get around to it and I'll send it to you tomorrow.
[30:16.260 --> 30:17.200]  I was like, oh, that's perfect.
[30:17.300 --> 30:18.700]  I'll have time for the show. It'll be ready.
[30:19.280 --> 30:23.300]  I woke up and like he had sent me 10 or 11 things immediately
[30:23.300 --> 30:26.380]  by like 8 a.m. the next day. He was on top of it.
[30:26.420 --> 30:29.860]  So I have no idea how long it took him, but he just sent so many things.
[30:30.100 --> 30:30.620]  He killed it.
[30:31.880 --> 30:33.300]  Yeah, it's one of my favorite parts of the site.
[30:33.880 --> 30:35.720]  Tony's a fucking talented dude.
[30:36.140 --> 30:36.720]  Incredibly talented.
[30:37.400 --> 30:37.880]  So funny.
[30:43.180 --> 30:46.400]  Imagine you're walking down the street and a bird poops all over your arm.
[30:46.560 --> 30:48.520]  Are you just going to pat it off with a dry napkin?
[30:48.860 --> 30:50.840]  No, you'd wash it off with water.
[30:51.140 --> 30:53.580]  So why are we treating our buttholes any differently?
[30:54.060 --> 30:56.020]  Stop smearing your business around with toilet paper
[30:56.020 --> 30:59.840]  and start washing with water with the Hello Tushy bidet.
[31:00.460 --> 31:02.780]  Hello Tushy bidet is fantastic product.
[31:02.880 --> 31:03.940]  It was so easy to install.
[31:04.100 --> 31:06.040]  It elevated my bathroom in every way.
[31:06.480 --> 31:09.220]  So stop spreading your business around your butthole with toilet paper.
[31:09.220 --> 31:11.600]  Start washing with Hello Tushy bidets.
[31:12.160 --> 31:15.300]  The Hello Tushy bidet attachment washes your bum with fresh water
[31:15.300 --> 31:17.620]  for a way better clean than toilet paper.
[31:18.080 --> 31:19.560]  Simply spray and pat dry.
[31:20.000 --> 31:21.540]  It attaches to your existing toilet.
[31:21.660 --> 31:22.900]  No electrician or plumber needed.

[32:03.040 --> 32:04.320]  I don't own a dog.
[32:04.320 --> 32:08.480]  I just have a 20 year old cat that Gavin still probably isn't aware exists.
[32:08.920 --> 32:12.220]  But using the Internet without ExpressVPN is like walking your dog
[32:12.220 --> 32:14.220]  in public without securing them on a leash.
[32:14.740 --> 32:16.600]  Most of the time, you'll probably be fine.
[32:16.860 --> 32:19.800]  But what if one day your dog runs away or gets dognapped?
[32:20.240 --> 32:24.120]  It's better to be careful, especially when it's as simple as using ExpressVPN.
[32:24.700 --> 32:27.560]  Every time you connect to an unencrypted network in cafes,
[32:27.780 --> 32:30.980]  hotels, airports, et cetera, your online data is not secured.
[32:31.560 --> 32:35.940]  Any hacker on the same network can gain access to and steal your personal data.
[32:36.500 --> 32:39.860]  But ExpressVPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel
[32:39.860 --> 32:42.340]  between your device and the Internet so they can't.
[32:42.940 --> 32:45.660]  It'd take a hacker with a supercomputer over a billion years
[32:45.660 --> 32:47.520]  to get past ExpressVPN's encryption.
[32:48.300 --> 32:51.460]  ExpressVPN works on all your devices, phones, laptops, tablets,
[32:51.700 --> 32:53.240]  even on your smart TV.
[32:53.880 --> 32:55.300]  And it's so easy to use.
[32:55.440 --> 32:58.100]  Just fire up the app and click one button to get protected.
[32:58.500 --> 33:02.520]  I like using ExpressVPN to access content libraries in other countries.
[33:02.740 --> 33:04.140]  It's fantastic, as I said before.
[33:04.600 --> 33:06.800]  It allowed me to watch the scripts spelling bee,
[33:06.960 --> 33:10.120]  which is a big part of my yearly activities.
[33:10.240 --> 33:11.400]  I love it. It's one of my favorite events.
[33:12.060 --> 33:16.900]  Get an extra three months of ExpressVPN free at ExpressVPN.com
[33:16.900 --> 33:20.520]  slash face. That's ExpressVPN.com slash face.

[34:35.140 --> 34:38.720]  Right now, Dadgrass is offering our listeners 20% off your first order

[34:46.020 --> 34:48.640]  That's dadgrass.com slash face.
[34:50.460 --> 34:57.580]  So I have that. I have one other small thing, but I don't know if you guys want to want to talk about other things before I know, not at all, just dive right into it.
[34:57.660 --> 34:59.140]  Yeah, I got one other go after.
[34:59.560 --> 35:05.960]  OK, well, this is it involves you, Gavin, because we've had, you know, rivalry sort of recently with things in the past.
[35:06.100 --> 35:07.300]  Yeah, you're going back and forth.
[35:08.160 --> 35:13.980]  You all might remember that Cosmic Crisp was kind enough to follow Geoff and I.
[35:14.380 --> 35:15.940]  I believe the podcast account as well.
[35:16.220 --> 35:17.980]  A long time ago, like in the summer.
[35:17.980 --> 35:24.400]  And we had a dialogue back and forth with them and they're like, oh, so, you know, that's great that you've given us support.
[35:24.680 --> 35:28.600]  I'd love to listen to it and show the team the podcast.
[35:28.720 --> 35:35.580]  So I said I sent the episode of me reviewing the Cosmic Crisp because I didn't send the Cosmic Crisp review.
[35:35.760 --> 35:37.580]  To be honest, you're kind of shitty about it, Gavin.
[35:37.640 --> 35:40.600]  You're pretty low on the Cosmic Crisp, which I think is ridiculous.
[35:41.220 --> 35:42.460]  There's a ridiculous rating to get.
[35:42.560 --> 35:43.580]  I was low on apples.
[35:44.240 --> 35:46.320]  Yeah, but that's, you know, it's part of the family.
[35:46.320 --> 35:48.180]  I just think that's an insane take, personally.
[35:48.780 --> 35:52.880]  So I sent instead my review, which I haven't listened to, but I assume is a lot more favorable.
[35:53.280 --> 35:57.860]  However, in that review, I ate a pink lady first, thinking it was a Cosmic Crisp,
[35:57.940 --> 36:00.440]  then realized my mistake, then reviewed the Cosmic Crisp.
[36:00.920 --> 36:02.940]  So it's like plus the name of our show.
[36:03.160 --> 36:04.800]  They seem like a very wholesome brand.
[36:05.140 --> 36:06.500]  I wasn't sure how that would go.
[36:06.560 --> 36:07.660]  So I sent them the podcast.
[36:08.060 --> 36:09.900]  They said, great, thank you so much.
[36:09.980 --> 36:11.220]  I'll get back to you next week.
[36:11.300 --> 36:12.920]  That was August 11th.
[36:13.440 --> 36:15.480]  They never they never commented back.
[36:15.860 --> 36:21.080]  Yeah, but a few days ago, a few days ago, I got another DM from them.
[36:21.380 --> 36:22.600]  And I'm so excited.
[36:23.080 --> 36:26.960]  I'm going to post it right now and then I'll read it out loud in our chat.
[36:27.140 --> 36:29.260]  This is what I received from Cosmic Crisp.
[36:30.180 --> 36:33.360]  Hi, Andrew and Geoff, excluding Gavin, Gavin is not mentioned.
[36:33.820 --> 36:36.100]  We hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.060]  Our team loved your episode.
[36:39.300 --> 36:42.380]  As a token of our appreciation for all of your support,
[36:42.380 --> 36:44.720]  we wanted to send you a little care package.
[36:44.940 --> 36:46.500]  Would you be able to send us your shipping
[36:46.500 --> 36:48.640]  information, mailing address, phone number and email?
[36:49.060 --> 36:50.500]  Wishing you a wonderful week.
[36:50.800 --> 36:53.700]  I don't know if they want their name mentioned, but the Cosmic Crisp social team.
[36:53.960 --> 36:55.040]  They reached out to us.
[36:55.180 --> 36:57.100]  We're going to Geoff, we're going to get a gift basket.
[36:57.300 --> 36:58.520]  Andrew, congratulations.
[36:58.860 --> 37:00.400]  All your hard work is paying off.
[37:00.600 --> 37:04.440]  Oh, congratulations to you for understanding what a good apple is
[37:04.440 --> 37:07.380]  and respecting the apple the way it deserves to be respected.
[37:07.420 --> 37:08.060]  Hold on a second.
[37:08.420 --> 37:09.000]  Gavin, we're talking.
[37:12.060 --> 37:13.540]  I'm glad you brought that up, Andrew,
[37:13.640 --> 37:17.760]  because I think I think respect is is is earned.
[37:18.040 --> 37:20.280]  And I hope that we I hope that I have
[37:20.280 --> 37:25.800]  earned the respect of the Cosmic Crisp social team as well as I think you clearly
[37:25.800 --> 37:29.480]  have. And now that we have that respect, I just I hope
[37:30.400 --> 37:32.580]  I hope we I hope we wield it appropriately
[37:32.580 --> 37:37.100]  and and know that we have respect that the respect that they shine at us shines
[37:37.100 --> 37:37.900]  right back at them.
[37:38.620 --> 37:43.760]  And wow, I believe I believe Gavin called it a bog standard apple.
[37:43.960 --> 37:47.120]  It would be really funny if they sent him a bog standard care package.
[37:48.160 --> 37:50.220]  That's the mediocre, not great thing.
[37:50.440 --> 37:52.200]  But I love that you weren't included.
[37:52.300 --> 37:54.840]  And I think that's deliberate because you didn't you didn't respect the apple.
[37:55.520 --> 37:56.240]  That's what happens.
[37:56.720 --> 37:58.340]  I feel like I didn't shit on the apple.
[37:59.380 --> 38:00.500]  Yeah, you weren't a fan of it.
[38:00.560 --> 38:03.600]  You and Eric both were not you're pretty down on the apple experience.
[38:04.180 --> 38:06.080]  Hmm. So they hmm.
[38:06.520 --> 38:08.380]  I can understand the following just due
[38:08.380 --> 38:12.940]  to because I don't really use socials, but then they listened to it
[38:12.940 --> 38:15.580]  and still didn't address me by name. Yeah.
[38:15.800 --> 38:17.560]  Yeah. They loved it.
[38:18.140 --> 38:20.780]  Hmm. That's at least loved two thirds.
[38:21.040 --> 38:21.560]  That's upsetting.
[38:22.720 --> 38:24.940]  It was a good apple. I mean, it was fine.
[38:25.020 --> 38:26.860]  It was I can't even dig.
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.760]  You know what? Listen, I just went through Gavin.
[38:29.940 --> 38:31.080]  I went through redemption year.
[38:31.380 --> 38:32.680]  You can have your own redemption year.
[38:32.720 --> 38:34.680]  You can try to make things right with the Cosmic Crisp people.
[38:35.340 --> 38:36.320]  Well, I can't.
[38:37.500 --> 38:39.380]  Be bothered, you can't fake an opinion.
[38:39.780 --> 38:41.280]  No, you can't.
[38:41.300 --> 38:44.160]  But can I ask you, like, in complete seriousness, have you found it yet?
[38:44.800 --> 38:49.440]  Did you do you find that you looked it's going to be a long couple of recordings.
[38:49.580 --> 38:49.940]  And this one.
[38:51.740 --> 38:53.720]  Hey, let me ask, let me ask you guys a question.
[38:55.200 --> 38:57.680]  Andrew, did you find Monopoly money on your front door yet?
[38:58.760 --> 39:00.000]  No, hasn't been placed.
[39:00.360 --> 39:02.140]  I've been vigilant. I'm going to be honest.
[39:02.140 --> 39:03.760]  I bought a paintball gun.
[39:08.180 --> 39:13.160]  But I bought a paintball gun because I stood God on you.
[39:13.280 --> 39:15.160]  No, no, no, no, no. This is what happened.
[39:15.260 --> 39:16.040]  Let me finish the story.
[39:16.480 --> 39:18.000]  I bought a paintball gun because I have
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.720]  a balcony and it overlooks like the entire walkway to the door.
[39:21.840 --> 39:27.300]  And I thought if I see you, I could fire down upon you instead of having to run
[39:27.300 --> 39:29.500]  and chase after I'd just fire you from the balcony.
[39:29.980 --> 39:35.080]  I then had guilt upon taking it home that I'd be shooting paintballs at you.
[39:35.160 --> 39:38.760]  And I returned the paintball gun because I felt bad about the possibility of
[39:38.760 --> 39:41.580]  pelting you with paintball, so I no longer have a paintball gun.
[39:41.840 --> 39:44.420]  My point was just I am prepared for this to happen.
[39:44.960 --> 39:46.120]  I've put things in place.
[39:46.560 --> 39:48.220]  I've maybe done some other home alone,
[39:48.260 --> 39:52.360]  like hijinks to booby trap the area waiting for your arrival.
[39:52.420 --> 39:53.480]  But I'm prepared.
[39:54.240 --> 39:56.020]  Ah, I'm ready to see me.
[39:56.600 --> 39:57.560]  I'm not going to see.
[39:58.200 --> 39:59.680]  I don't think that that's possible.
[39:59.700 --> 40:00.780]  I got a camera set up.
[40:01.020 --> 40:03.000]  I got multiple cameras, multiple angles.
[40:04.140 --> 40:07.000]  Unless you like parachute in, which if the hey, you win,
[40:07.180 --> 40:09.660]  if you parachute in, I'll give it to you.
[40:12.220 --> 40:14.660]  Hmm. How long do I have to do this?
[40:14.800 --> 40:16.760]  What do we say? You said the end of December.
[40:16.880 --> 40:18.120]  If you want, I'm willing to extend it.
[40:18.260 --> 40:19.260]  You want to push it back a little bit.
[40:19.700 --> 40:20.540]  I'm OK with that.
[40:21.200 --> 40:23.420]  Then we'll keep. Do I have to take the ferry?
[40:23.560 --> 40:24.840]  There's surely quicker ways to that island.
[40:25.000 --> 40:26.780]  Can I fly there? You could fly there.
[40:26.780 --> 40:28.220]  There's multiple ways you could fly.
[40:28.540 --> 40:29.200]  I prefer the ferry.
[40:29.580 --> 40:31.340]  Why don't you just fly?
[40:31.820 --> 40:33.500]  I because I prefer the ferry experience.
[40:34.180 --> 40:35.540]  I've never used the airport.
[40:35.680 --> 40:37.680]  We have. There's also a seaplane.
[40:37.940 --> 40:40.760]  You can use. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[40:40.780 --> 40:41.660]  Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
[40:41.660 --> 40:42.480]  Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
[40:42.540 --> 40:45.980]  I don't I don't mean to interrupt here, but what the fuck?
[40:46.360 --> 40:48.160]  I thought the only way to get to where you
[40:48.160 --> 40:51.240]  are was we had to like fly somewhere, go somewhere, take a ferry.
[40:51.580 --> 40:55.220]  No, we can fly directly to where you are.
[40:55.220 --> 40:56.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[40:56.260 --> 41:00.920]  I mean, this in the past, he prefers the bigger airport or some shit.
[41:01.100 --> 41:02.160]  Yeah, I prefer this.
[41:02.760 --> 41:04.300]  Yeah, there's a seaplane as well.
[41:04.420 --> 41:07.640]  It's actually the probably the most convenient way to get here would be going
[41:07.640 --> 41:10.640]  from the airport to the seaplane, which is pretty close.
[41:10.780 --> 41:13.760]  The Vancouver airport to the seaplane, then flying across.
[41:13.880 --> 41:14.520]  It's a beautiful view.
[41:14.940 --> 41:16.560]  I just prefer the boat.
[41:16.660 --> 41:19.840]  How many hours does the boat add to your journey?
[41:20.180 --> 41:24.580]  So the seaplane, I think, is like a 25, 30 minute flight across.
[41:24.580 --> 41:27.720]  The boat is like two hours, maybe.
[41:28.120 --> 41:30.140]  This is this is this is unreal.
[41:30.280 --> 41:34.980]  I thought that I thought that the ferry was like such an obstacle for us to overcome.
[41:35.140 --> 41:36.520]  And then I'm finding out that, oh,
[41:36.540 --> 41:40.000]  we could just get a plane like any other fucking place in the world.
[41:40.400 --> 41:42.520]  Are you serious? Is this for real?
[41:42.620 --> 41:46.740]  The planes, you know, believe I'm furious right now.
[41:47.100 --> 41:49.040]  No, you should be happy to learn that
[41:49.040 --> 41:52.340]  there's a seaplane because it is a beautiful sight to fly into that harbor.
[41:52.340 --> 41:54.000]  It's nice. This sucks.
[41:54.460 --> 41:56.200]  This sucks. I'd be ecstatic if I were you.
[41:56.880 --> 41:58.380]  So what, you take off from the water?
[41:59.120 --> 41:59.900]  Yeah, yeah.
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.840]  You it lands in the water, flies from the water, floats.
[42:03.980 --> 42:05.600]  It goes to go and then you go in the sky.
[42:05.600 --> 42:07.860]  And that's from the airport on your island.
[42:08.040 --> 42:11.580]  So you go from the airport and then you just you go to the seaplane location.
[42:11.580 --> 42:13.420]  It's probably like a 15, 20 minute capture.
[42:13.560 --> 42:16.700]  I'm just imagining a normal airport, but one of the gates is in the water.
[42:17.040 --> 42:18.700]  No, I wish.
[42:18.800 --> 42:20.740]  No, it's like a little it's on a dock.
[42:20.800 --> 42:21.560]  It's a small little thing.
[42:21.560 --> 42:22.580]  I haven't been in a long time.
[42:22.840 --> 42:25.160]  It could be different, but it's not that big of an area.
[42:25.260 --> 42:28.000]  You walk out on the dock, you hop in the plane, it flies to the other side.
[42:29.240 --> 42:30.920]  Huh, easy, like 20 minutes.
[42:31.200 --> 42:33.960]  I think there also might be like a helijet as well.
[42:34.280 --> 42:35.580]  It might be. I think there's multiple.
[42:35.980 --> 42:37.880]  They're adding a fast ferry in the summer.
[42:38.240 --> 42:39.580]  So you got so much choice.
[42:40.380 --> 42:42.100]  There's a lot of variety to pick from.
[42:42.660 --> 42:43.940]  Anyway, I'm excited and I'm prepared.
[42:44.320 --> 42:46.000]  I've never been on a seaplane.
[42:46.160 --> 42:46.940]  That sounds cool.
[42:47.300 --> 42:50.140]  That's like Indiana Jones or like Jake from Tales from the Gold Monkey.
[42:50.220 --> 42:51.140]  Did you guys ever watch that show?
[42:51.700 --> 42:54.160]  No. What is Tales from the Gold Monkey?
[42:54.460 --> 42:56.580]  It was like an Indiana Jones rip off in the 80s.
[42:56.660 --> 42:58.380]  Oh, well, you guys talk off.
[42:58.460 --> 43:00.540]  I'd love to see. That sounds great.
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.420]  Well, have we decided what happens if we both are successful?
[43:03.560 --> 43:05.340]  Is that a tie? Is that just a wash at this point?
[43:06.080 --> 43:07.620]  Yeah, I think it's a very expensive tie.
[43:08.900 --> 43:11.360]  OK, so now you're trying to tie is what you're doing.
[43:12.500 --> 43:14.080]  No, it's not. It's not 1-0.
[43:14.200 --> 43:16.340]  Because I've already placed. It's oh, it's 1-0.
[43:16.440 --> 43:17.980]  You don't even know. It makes it so funny.
[43:18.460 --> 43:20.400]  But that's like me saying it's 1-0.
[43:20.400 --> 43:23.080]  Well, it's you know, I've got more places to hide it.
[43:23.180 --> 43:25.960]  But that's why if you found the money yet, I know it's not on the door.
[43:26.040 --> 43:29.080]  I've checked his footage is zero percent chance that's happened.
[43:29.500 --> 43:31.600]  Have you checked in the last 40 minutes?
[43:32.000 --> 43:32.620]  No, I haven't.
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.780]  If you put it in the last 40 minutes, that'd be crazy.
[43:36.200 --> 43:38.720]  Wouldn't it be crazy if I was in Austin and you were in my town
[43:40.360 --> 43:42.080]  different times? That'd be funny.
[43:42.900 --> 43:45.360]  And I took the ferry, not realizing there was a seaplane.
[43:46.700 --> 43:47.960]  That's why you're so pissed off.
[43:51.000 --> 43:52.680]  Tales of the Gold Monkey looks great.
[43:53.020 --> 43:54.480]  The dog has an eyepatch.
[43:54.800 --> 43:57.980]  Yeah, the dog has an eyepatch to the dog's eye.
[43:58.400 --> 43:59.760]  Why does the dog have an eyepatch?
[43:59.920 --> 44:02.720]  I don't know. I mean, it's my dogs with one eye.
[44:02.800 --> 44:04.140]  I think we've all seen dogs with like one eye.
[44:04.200 --> 44:05.340]  Why would he have an eye?
[44:05.500 --> 44:07.180]  I was it was 1982.
[44:07.380 --> 44:08.580]  I was seven years old.
[44:08.640 --> 44:10.660]  I don't remember. I just remember that I liked it when I was a kid.
[44:10.840 --> 44:12.180]  That's a good point. An animal loses an eye.
[44:12.240 --> 44:13.160]  It just doesn't have an eye.
[44:13.320 --> 44:16.700]  Yeah, does the man does he is he so offended by like the dog's one eye?
[44:16.760 --> 44:18.140]  He's like, better patch that up.
[44:18.700 --> 44:19.660]  The dog is embarrassed.
[44:20.240 --> 44:22.000]  I think maybe the dog was self-conscious.
[44:22.200 --> 44:22.660]  I don't know.
[44:23.240 --> 44:26.120]  I have a little follow up from the last podcast we recorded.
[44:26.600 --> 44:27.580]  OK, I'd love to hear it.
[44:27.740 --> 44:30.100]  I'm not sure whether this would upset you,
[44:30.200 --> 44:32.060]  Andrew, or whether this is something you also get.
[44:32.600 --> 44:32.680]  But
[44:33.800 --> 44:38.120]  I sent something to Geoff and I got ten Haas back.
[44:38.960 --> 44:41.120]  Oh, yeah. No, Geoff gives those Haas out all the time.
[44:41.320 --> 44:42.700]  He's a great Haas. Did you get ten though?
[44:43.200 --> 44:44.880]  I've never counted Geoff's Haas. It's a lot.
[44:45.500 --> 44:50.680]  I gave I gave out ten Haas to Gavin the other day because something he said
[44:50.680 --> 44:55.120]  deserved ten Haas, and then I commented that I meant every one of those Haas.
[44:55.200 --> 44:59.180]  I gave out, I want to say, seven or eight Haas to Andrew the other day.
[44:59.700 --> 45:01.020]  It was pretty good, but it wasn't ten.
[45:01.160 --> 45:02.540]  I don't think. What was the ten Haas?
[45:02.640 --> 45:07.320]  What happened? Oh, I just sent Geoff a clip of some kid kicking a football.
[45:09.620 --> 45:10.360]  That's great.
[45:11.640 --> 45:12.920]  Why didn't I? Can I get the clip?
[45:13.740 --> 45:14.600]  Can I see the clip?
[45:15.300 --> 45:18.060]  I'd love to see it. Let me post it on the old Discord.
[45:18.620 --> 45:20.220]  Is it like a TikTok or is it a video?
[45:20.340 --> 45:20.900]  What are we talking about?
[45:20.900 --> 45:24.480]  I assume it's a TikTok that's on Instagram, which is how I receive all TikToks
[45:25.340 --> 45:26.220]  because I'm old.
[45:26.820 --> 45:31.580]  For the audience, it's it's a kid playing soccer and the text is Jesus Christ.
[45:31.760 --> 45:32.620]  It's Jason Bourne.
[45:32.940 --> 45:37.540]  And then the kid kicks the same kid, hits the ball into three kids faces.
[45:37.880 --> 45:38.460]  Back to back to back.
[45:44.340 --> 45:45.380]  That's awesome.
[45:48.760 --> 45:53.000]  My favorite part is that the guy filming
[45:53.620 --> 45:56.340]  points the camera down after the first one, right?
[45:56.660 --> 45:57.440]  OK, that's too much.
[45:59.980 --> 46:03.500]  I like when the second kid gets hit and runs into the first kid,
[46:03.600 --> 46:05.680]  like they're both beating each other three stages style.
[46:06.980 --> 46:10.280]  I watched it, I watched it like 15 times.
[46:10.820 --> 46:12.260]  It's fucking chaos.
[46:12.500 --> 46:13.940]  It's a ten Haas clip.
[46:13.940 --> 46:15.060]  For sure.
[46:18.700 --> 46:19.880]  It's the perfect clip.
[46:20.380 --> 46:21.200]  It's a it's a winner.
[46:21.380 --> 46:24.860]  If we were picking top three clips I've seen of the year, that's probably number one.
[46:24.980 --> 46:26.520]  Oh, that is amazing.
[46:26.780 --> 46:28.460]  I love that they all give up progressively.
[46:28.840 --> 46:32.080]  Like that is what I have to say.
[46:35.320 --> 46:36.080]  That's great.
[46:36.820 --> 46:40.260]  Oh, yeah, because it's like a TikTok probably posted on Instagram.
[46:40.680 --> 46:43.100]  There's no way of telling who filmed that or who's responsible for it.
[46:43.160 --> 46:43.360]  Yeah.
[46:43.360 --> 46:46.240]  Yeah. But whoever you are, whoever's kid that is.
[46:46.680 --> 46:47.200]  Thanks.
[46:48.460 --> 46:50.020]  That's the funniest shit I've ever seen.
[46:53.780 --> 46:54.560]  It's great.
[46:55.140 --> 46:58.360]  People falling or getting hurt, but not like seriously hurt.
[46:58.580 --> 46:59.440]  Always amazing.
[46:59.840 --> 47:01.260]  It just doesn't stop.
[47:01.460 --> 47:02.580]  It brings me so much joy.
[47:04.060 --> 47:05.620]  The kid is ruthless.
[47:07.340 --> 47:10.760]  He knows what he's doing and he's still doing it.
[47:10.760 --> 47:15.000]  Oh, I like that Gavin said this is something that might upset me.
[47:15.300 --> 47:15.960]  This is great.
[47:16.880 --> 47:17.360]  Laugh.
[47:18.200 --> 47:19.660]  That is ten ha worthy.
[47:20.080 --> 47:22.260]  Absolutely. It is absolutely a ten ha clip.
[47:22.760 --> 47:27.640]  Oh, Gavin, can I subscribe to the clip of children getting hit by things or like
[47:27.640 --> 47:31.800]  just any impact, whatever feed Geoff is on that I'm not on through you?
[47:31.980 --> 47:33.280]  I'm subscribing to that feed.
[47:33.740 --> 47:36.820]  I feel like I don't send my friends clips very often.
[47:36.920 --> 47:40.440]  Like, Geoff, you probably had maybe two for me.
[47:40.760 --> 47:41.980]  This year. Yeah, this year.
[47:42.460 --> 47:46.840]  Yeah. I just like I like to make sure that all a plus gold star winners.
[47:48.020 --> 47:49.200]  Why one on that list?
[47:49.220 --> 47:50.660]  Because that's a great, great clip.
[47:51.640 --> 47:53.940]  If you guys if you guys had to talk,
[47:54.340 --> 47:58.060]  I would put you on my list of funny tech talks that I saw.
[47:58.260 --> 48:00.200]  I just she's the only person on my list right now.
[48:00.240 --> 48:04.120]  But I send absolute fucking bangers on Tick-Tock on your list.
[48:04.240 --> 48:06.980]  I just joined Tick-Tock a week ago
[48:06.980 --> 48:10.220]  because I realized America's Funniest Home Videos is on Tick-Tock.
[48:10.220 --> 48:14.860]  Oh, yeah. I'm like, I could just watch people fall whenever I want to and bite size.
[48:15.040 --> 48:15.840]  Oh, this is great.
[48:16.280 --> 48:17.620]  Do people shit on Tick-Tock?
[48:17.680 --> 48:20.360]  And I know they're stealing all my data and I know everything about me and stuff
[48:20.360 --> 48:22.580]  now and they're probably making clones of me in China.
[48:22.740 --> 48:24.340]  But there it is.
[48:24.360 --> 48:26.540]  It is just a fucking nut shot city.
[48:26.660 --> 48:29.340]  It is just hours upon hours.
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.760]  Skateboards, footballs, bicycles, you name it.
[48:33.800 --> 48:35.540]  Just wrecking dicks.
[48:35.800 --> 48:37.440]  I wonder if we should have the official
[48:39.260 --> 48:44.700]  Face compilation where you go back to everything you sent Emily and to each one.
[48:45.080 --> 48:46.200]  You know, that's the end of that.
[48:46.520 --> 48:48.200]  It's funny you say that because you're rated.
[48:49.140 --> 48:51.220]  I kind of did that a little bit already,
[48:51.220 --> 48:54.240]  because tomorrow, one of the things we're going to film that I mentioned earlier was
[48:54.240 --> 48:58.820]  Andrew wants to do this like ladder tournament for like Funniest Fall Video
[48:58.820 --> 49:00.740]  Drafting Falls, Drafting Falls.
[49:00.960 --> 49:01.700]  Right. Yes.
[49:01.920 --> 49:05.220]  And so the only place I found I went to look
[49:05.220 --> 49:08.320]  for fall videos is I just went back through my list of shit I sent to Emily
[49:08.320 --> 49:09.820]  and just pulled the funniest falls I found.
[49:10.960 --> 49:13.540]  So I didn't know I didn't know what you were talking about.
[49:13.920 --> 49:15.200]  Do you understand now?
[49:15.660 --> 49:17.620]  Is it just the way you phrased it?
[49:18.200 --> 49:19.460]  I some of it was my fault.
[49:19.520 --> 49:22.760]  I think some of it I'm surprised that Eric just didn't know what a snake draft was.
[49:22.900 --> 49:24.320]  By now, I just got the message.
[49:24.480 --> 49:25.920]  The snake draft wasn't the confusing part.
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.980]  It's just that it like we weren't doing it from like a pool.
[49:30.080 --> 49:31.400]  You're just like pick something.
[49:31.500 --> 49:32.880]  I'm like, what's the point of a draft?
[49:33.440 --> 49:34.720]  We're not doing it from a pool.
[49:34.720 --> 49:36.120]  So you just pick some things.
[49:36.380 --> 49:37.260]  The pool is all falls.
[49:37.620 --> 49:38.320]  And then. Right.
[49:38.420 --> 49:43.720]  And you kept saying falls, which is such a like not a thing that you would actively
[49:43.720 --> 49:45.960]  draft from it without context.
[49:46.180 --> 49:48.220]  I just read four of us could record
[49:48.220 --> 49:50.800]  a supplemental of doing a snake draft of our favorite.
[49:51.900 --> 49:54.220]  Yeah, I was like, what does that mean?
[49:54.260 --> 49:55.580]  I think I've said a snake draft.
[49:55.640 --> 49:56.240]  That's very clear.
[49:57.420 --> 49:59.900]  I, I mean, I guess so.
[50:00.020 --> 50:02.080]  It just doesn't. There's no pool we're drawing from.
[50:02.140 --> 50:03.860]  It's just pick some falls that you like.
[50:03.860 --> 50:06.820]  I don't I don't know what the point of the snake draft is if we're not doing it
[50:06.820 --> 50:10.940]  from a pool, Geoff said, I'll do it, I said, I don't know what you just said.
[50:11.360 --> 50:12.560]  Yeah, I understand.
[50:13.560 --> 50:17.280]  I think it's straightforward, just doesn't the snake draft doesn't make sense to me.
[50:17.680 --> 50:20.160]  It's falls. I don't know what that's the pool.
[50:20.360 --> 50:21.920]  I don't understand how that's not a pool.
[50:22.240 --> 50:24.940]  It's not because because when you say
[50:24.940 --> 50:29.380]  basketball teams, it means the NFL draft only picks quarterbacks one year.
[50:29.400 --> 50:30.140]  Like, what do you think?
[50:30.400 --> 50:31.640]  What are you talking about?
[50:31.640 --> 50:36.140]  I think I think that they I think that they choose from a pool of players who
[50:36.140 --> 50:39.620]  have entered that that people have gone through and chosen from.
[50:39.820 --> 50:43.320]  So I do think that there's a pool because you can't here's the thing.
[50:43.400 --> 50:45.180]  They're not drafting me, Andrew.
[50:45.520 --> 50:47.840]  Andrew, I'm going to they're not drafting.
[50:48.060 --> 50:54.160]  I'm going to the Buffalo Sabres drafted a guy that isn't even fucking real.
[50:54.420 --> 50:58.100]  They made up a human being and drafted him as a joke.
[50:58.100 --> 50:59.060]  It's happening.
[50:59.360 --> 51:00.300]  You idiot.
[51:01.200 --> 51:03.780]  To quote Gavin, you fool.
[51:04.200 --> 51:04.940]  They've done this.
[51:05.420 --> 51:06.860]  Who did they draft? That's not real.
[51:07.200 --> 51:07.240]  What?
[51:07.960 --> 51:10.040]  Nick just said that Hockey League draft.
[51:13.740 --> 51:15.420]  Who's the Buffalo Sabres guy?
[51:15.740 --> 51:16.360]  I'm blanking on this.
[51:16.420 --> 51:18.000]  You know what? I stand.
[51:18.260 --> 51:19.760]  I I will I will.
[51:19.940 --> 51:22.440]  I'll admit that I was wrong because Nick is right.
[51:23.000 --> 51:24.500]  The Hockey League drafted a monkey.
[51:24.640 --> 51:25.600]  So I stand corrected.
[51:26.540 --> 51:27.340]  Taro Tujimoto.
[51:28.180 --> 51:33.700]  He's a made up player picked by the Bruins in the 1974 draft in the 11th round.
[51:34.360 --> 51:35.320]  They did it as a joke.
[51:35.440 --> 51:38.580]  They're like, wouldn't it be funny if we just snuck a player in that doesn't exist
[51:38.580 --> 51:39.640]  and we'll see if anyone notices?
[51:39.980 --> 51:42.200]  And he became like the hype of like the team.
[51:42.480 --> 51:44.400]  Everyone's fucking excited for this guy that wasn't real.
[51:45.220 --> 51:47.120]  I got to say, man, you have to be eligible.
[51:47.900 --> 51:51.540]  Hockey does wacky shit that other sports just aren't brave enough to do.
[51:51.620 --> 51:55.100]  Like hockey does not take it for a sport that's all about beating the shit out
[51:55.100 --> 51:57.180]  of each other. It really doesn't take itself too seriously.
[51:57.300 --> 51:58.360]  I appreciate that about it.
[51:58.800 --> 52:01.020]  Sometimes it does in ways that suck.
[52:01.080 --> 52:02.760]  It does in ways that suck. It does for sure.
[52:02.840 --> 52:06.220]  But but they see but they have like a high sense of humor, I would say.
[52:06.320 --> 52:08.720]  I wonder if there's anything in the actual rules to prevent.
[52:08.940 --> 52:10.380]  Like, obviously, there's no reason to.
[52:10.500 --> 52:13.840]  But could they draft someone that they wanted to just because
[52:14.480 --> 52:20.020]  like you are involuntarily drafted to the Blackhawks or something?
[52:20.140 --> 52:22.300]  You're just like, oh, man, I'm on the Penguins now.
[52:22.300 --> 52:23.340]  Oh, shit. Fuck.
[52:23.560 --> 52:27.780]  I mean, in the NFL and NBA, there's eligibility requirements, right?
[52:27.880 --> 52:30.340]  So aren't there in hockey in some way?
[52:30.480 --> 52:31.620]  Maybe they've added them.
[52:31.680 --> 52:36.000]  But I mean, they definitely drafted a guy that didn't exist in the past.
[52:37.600 --> 52:40.420]  So it's happened anyway, I think it'll be fun.
[52:40.900 --> 52:41.860]  I think we'll have a good time.
[52:42.920 --> 52:43.880]  I agree. Sharing some falls.
[52:45.580 --> 52:49.220]  I think it could become I was telling Andrew we were talking about earlier,
[52:49.220 --> 52:51.860]  it could become like a yearly thing we do in the fall.
[52:52.440 --> 52:55.560]  It could fall false, false, false, false.
[52:55.980 --> 52:59.160]  Yeah, I have four that I'm very excited about.
[52:59.220 --> 53:03.920]  I need to do some more research, figure out where what what things are on my board
[53:03.920 --> 53:06.960]  and where I have one that I'm worried Eric is going to steal.
[53:08.060 --> 53:09.940]  Outside of that, I feel pretty good about my other ones.
[53:10.240 --> 53:13.380]  I have. Well, let me just say I when I sat down
[53:13.380 --> 53:15.520]  to think about what the greatest falls of all time are,
[53:15.560 --> 53:18.460]  I think I probably came up with a lot of ones that you all have as well.
[53:18.460 --> 53:22.840]  And so I'm going to go the other route and I'm going to try and find only falls
[53:22.840 --> 53:25.000]  you've never seen before that are more obscure.
[53:25.420 --> 53:27.380]  So otherwise we'll have the Great Lady.
[53:27.520 --> 53:28.540]  We're all going to have Great Lady.
[53:28.700 --> 53:30.640]  Only one person can have the Great Lady, though.
[53:31.100 --> 53:34.900]  Yeah, so it's not like we're all going to we're all going to submit four falls each
[53:34.900 --> 53:36.580]  and there's going to be four copies of Great Lady.
[53:37.200 --> 53:39.400]  So I'm trying to. Oh, good Lord.
[53:39.820 --> 53:40.920]  Well, no. Oh, good Lord.
[53:41.260 --> 53:46.520]  But but but I am a little concerned.
[53:46.520 --> 53:48.240]  Like going through my my Tik Toks, trying to find them.
[53:48.640 --> 53:51.500]  There's a fine line, I think, between falling and crashing.
[53:51.700 --> 53:55.500]  And I don't know which side of it is what your tolerance level is.
[53:55.740 --> 53:57.500]  Is it falling if you go up first?
[53:59.660 --> 54:01.600]  I think so. I think so, yeah.
[54:02.360 --> 54:03.420]  Yeah, I got a great one.
[54:03.540 --> 54:04.980]  I was thinking of movie falls.
[54:05.580 --> 54:09.940]  I was thinking of sports falls, entertainment falls.
[54:10.140 --> 54:13.100]  I've been trying to decide if my sushi fall is draftable
[54:13.100 --> 54:14.520]  because there's no visual to see.
[54:14.520 --> 54:15.120]  But that was it.
[54:15.280 --> 54:16.800]  That's genuinely a great fall.
[54:17.140 --> 54:18.800]  I mean, could you recreate it somehow?
[54:19.260 --> 54:22.840]  Like I wouldn't want it would be too dangerous to recreate and slow down.
[54:23.160 --> 54:26.860]  That was that was a perfect fall that could have been catastrophic.
[54:26.920 --> 54:29.300]  But it is just I landed. I landed it.
[54:30.380 --> 54:32.400]  Should we have a little end of the ankle checkup?
[54:32.520 --> 54:35.280]  What were we at? Oh, yeah, we could do that.
[54:36.260 --> 54:37.100]  Got all sorts of options.
[54:37.980 --> 54:39.020]  Where where's your ankle at?
[54:40.100 --> 54:43.600]  Right now? Yeah, like 85% I'd say.
[54:44.660 --> 54:45.900]  We could graph this.
[54:45.980 --> 54:49.020]  If we ask you every week, you could get a chart going.
[54:49.540 --> 54:51.180]  You could. I'd say 85% right now.
[54:51.760 --> 54:54.040]  Got a little tightness in my right Achilles, but that's OK.
[54:54.300 --> 54:57.260]  And every time it plummets, we'll write a sushi box.
[54:58.720 --> 55:00.240]  Sushi grade. Yeah.
[55:01.240 --> 55:02.320]  Yeah, that's great.
[55:02.960 --> 55:04.480]  How are how are your ankles, Gavin?
[55:05.180 --> 55:05.800]  Oh, fine.
[55:06.340 --> 55:07.760]  I haven't tried to move a table in a while.
[55:08.380 --> 55:10.080]  So you fully recovered? Fully recovered.
[55:10.560 --> 55:12.220]  I could do a marathon tomorrow.
[55:13.620 --> 55:13.940]  Really?
[55:14.880 --> 55:15.640]  Yeah, I will if you will.
[55:16.160 --> 55:17.360]  I think I have to now, right?
[55:17.420 --> 55:23.020]  Because of the whole thing I activated with the trash in the previous one.
[55:23.040 --> 55:24.420]  Oh, you're right. Yeah.
[55:24.860 --> 55:26.380]  I think I'm due now. Tomorrow?
[55:27.200 --> 55:28.000]  No, I can't do tomorrow.
[55:30.380 --> 55:31.720]  I'm going to be tired tomorrow.
[55:32.800 --> 55:34.840]  On office day? On office day.
[55:34.900 --> 55:36.280]  Yes, it's a busy, busy day.
[55:36.520 --> 55:38.320]  Got a lot of stuff to do. It is a busy day.
[55:38.640 --> 55:39.680]  We do have a lot of stuff to do.
[55:40.440 --> 55:43.380]  I did a thing that I think I'm the only one who prepared for,
[55:43.520 --> 55:45.080]  because I'm going to be honest, I forgot.
[55:45.300 --> 55:47.060]  And then I remembered a few days ago.
[55:47.460 --> 55:48.840]  I have a stuffing recipe.
[55:49.220 --> 55:50.340]  Oh, good. So do I.
[55:50.900 --> 55:52.060]  Oh, you do? That's great.
[55:52.280 --> 55:52.900]  Yeah, perfect.
[55:53.320 --> 55:55.480]  I think I'm going to forget my own contest, my own thing.
[55:56.000 --> 55:56.820]  Well, I just didn't.
[55:56.860 --> 55:58.580]  You know, it was something we kind of talked about in passing.
[55:58.700 --> 55:59.840]  I wasn't sure. But yeah, I'm ready.
[55:59.920 --> 56:01.300]  I'm ready for the deep lore about stuffing.
[56:02.440 --> 56:04.820]  OK, so I have I have a question about that.
[56:05.140 --> 56:08.280]  We are fucking an hour in almost 55 minutes in.
[56:08.280 --> 56:11.280]  Do we want to do our stuffing recipes now or save it for the next episode?
[56:11.640 --> 56:15.780]  I think if if if we don't, if we don't take forever on it, I think we can do it now.
[56:15.860 --> 56:17.760]  I think I don't know if Gavin has one.
[56:17.760 --> 56:18.980]  I'd be shocked if Gavin has.
[56:19.160 --> 56:20.860]  But I don't think he's going to have one.
[56:20.900 --> 56:21.900]  Also, I'm confused.
[56:22.260 --> 56:25.500]  Were we supposed to come with a stuffing recipe or a Thanksgiving recipe?
[56:26.200 --> 56:26.740]  Stuffing recipe.
[56:27.080 --> 56:27.780]  Stuffing recipe.
[56:28.520 --> 56:32.060]  I thought it was a recipe for a Thanksgiving food.
[56:32.900 --> 56:35.960]  I have two Thanksgiving recipes that are not stuffing,
[56:36.160 --> 56:37.940]  but I guess you can turn them into stuffing.
[56:38.280 --> 56:39.640]  And then Nick is saying the same thing.
[56:39.680 --> 56:40.780]  I thought it was what Eric thinks.
[56:40.860 --> 56:42.140]  I thought it was just a recipe for Thanksgiving.
[56:42.480 --> 56:45.000]  And then the name of the book was deep lore about stuffing.
[56:45.280 --> 56:47.440]  You know what? You might be right.
[56:47.600 --> 56:50.800]  And I am, but I'm just making sure you guys caught up in the name.
[56:51.060 --> 56:52.740]  I definitely came up with a stuffing recipe.
[56:53.140 --> 56:56.920]  I think I probably conflated the two, even when I was talking about it
[56:56.920 --> 56:58.100]  and was of two minds.
[56:58.760 --> 57:01.680]  I think I wanted it to be a stuffing recipe.
[57:01.680 --> 57:05.480]  But I also think I mentioned that we should all trade Thanksgiving recipes
[57:05.480 --> 57:06.180]  with the audience.
[57:06.180 --> 57:08.300]  So I think that makes sense about it.
[57:08.340 --> 57:11.020]  Yeah. Well, I want the recipes anyway that you have, Eric.
[57:11.440 --> 57:12.520]  I imagine. Yeah, absolutely.
[57:13.060 --> 57:14.040]  Absolutely. All recipes are valid.
[57:14.120 --> 57:15.080]  It sounds like Nick's got them.
[57:15.600 --> 57:16.400]  Eric's got them.
[57:16.720 --> 57:17.380]  I've got them.
[57:18.720 --> 57:19.560]  Andrew's got them.
[57:19.800 --> 57:21.580]  I just Gavin, what about you?
[57:21.980 --> 57:22.740]  Oh, I got one.
[57:23.240 --> 57:23.780]  Oh, good.
[57:24.300 --> 57:25.440]  I've got one. If I go last.
[57:27.360 --> 57:30.760]  Oh, no, I think that I think I should go ahead and go first.
[57:32.600 --> 57:34.560]  All right. That's going to change things slightly.
[57:34.560 --> 57:39.340]  Hold on. Oh, my brows has just crashed a little bit there.
[57:41.480 --> 57:45.440]  Does anybody does anybody's recipe come with a story?
[57:45.920 --> 57:49.740]  No, I don't have like a really long story about it or whatever.
[57:49.740 --> 57:52.500]  But mine, like the food is inspired.
[57:52.520 --> 57:53.920]  I brought a food and a drink.
[57:54.160 --> 57:55.780]  Why don't you go first, Eric?
[57:55.840 --> 57:57.140]  Why don't you eat it off? Yeah, that's fine.
[57:57.180 --> 57:58.620]  I'll I'll give Gavin some time.
[57:59.760 --> 58:00.480]  Yeah, no problem.
[58:00.900 --> 58:02.600]  The first is just a drink.
[58:02.600 --> 58:06.420]  This is what you can be used, what you can be sipping on while you make this food.
[58:06.480 --> 58:09.600]  It is a peppermint bark, white Russian.
[58:10.400 --> 58:12.740]  I don't know if you guys have ever had rum chata.
[58:12.900 --> 58:13.880]  Geoff, you're excluded.
[58:14.180 --> 58:16.740]  Thank you. Rum chata is like a liqueur.
[58:16.860 --> 58:17.580]  It's very nice.
[58:17.680 --> 58:21.640]  And what I do is I make some vodka, which is usually about two ounces
[58:23.360 --> 58:26.100]  with an ounce to an ounce and a half of rum chata
[58:26.100 --> 58:28.080]  within another like half ounce of Kahlua.
[58:28.200 --> 58:30.160]  And you're just making a white Russian.
[58:30.280 --> 58:31.660]  It's very creamy. It's very nice.
[58:31.660 --> 58:36.800]  It's just the right amount of boozy while you're making my grandma's
[58:36.800 --> 58:38.160]  pumpkin pie cheesecake.
[58:38.220 --> 58:41.580]  And I know that sounds like it would be a cheesecake that is pumpkin pie.
[58:41.620 --> 58:46.300]  It's not. It is a pumpkin pie with a layer of cheesecake on the bottom,
[58:46.880 --> 58:51.360]  which is the I love it every year
[58:51.360 --> 58:55.060]  because it is the right mix of sweet with like creamy
[58:55.060 --> 58:57.400]  and a little tart the way that
[58:57.400 --> 59:03.900]  the way that sort of you need something to break up the sweetness of the pumpkin pie.
[59:04.140 --> 59:07.000]  Making the cheesecake is it's just like making a regular cheesecake,
[59:07.180 --> 59:12.100]  just whipping the cream cheese together with sugar and then putting it into
[59:12.100 --> 59:16.160]  a already made pie crust because grandma doesn't need to make a pie from scratch.
[59:16.580 --> 59:20.700]  And then you pumpkin pie filling is just a bunch of spices
[59:20.700 --> 59:24.600]  mixed in with pumpkin puree, some evaporated milk and some eggs.
[59:24.980 --> 59:25.980]  That's just mixing.
[59:25.980 --> 59:30.140]  My grandma said whisk that together slow and then pour it on top of the cheesecake
[59:31.420 --> 59:33.820]  slow and then you just put it you put it in the oven.
[59:34.080 --> 59:35.540]  You put it in the oven. It's so easy to do.
[59:35.580 --> 59:37.920]  Look, I got a whole written out recipe, but I'm not going to bore you
[59:37.920 --> 59:43.520]  with all the details because I don't have a picture because it's I mean,
[59:43.540 --> 59:46.240]  I can show you somebody else's pumpkin pie cheesecake, I guess.
[59:47.660 --> 59:50.480]  Now, what we'll do, what we'll do is we'll take the recipes
[59:50.480 --> 59:53.920]  and we'll write them out and then we'll I guess we'll put them on Instagram.
[59:55.320 --> 59:56.940]  Yeah, I'm ready. I'm ready with mine.
[59:57.280 --> 59:58.700]  Oh, fantastic. Go for it, Gavin.
[59:58.780 --> 01:00:01.120]  By the way, Eric, I think those are sounded fantastic. Fantastic.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:07.680]  Thank you. OK, so can of beets and tater tots.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.260]  Well, it's cranberry in it and it can. Yeah.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.500]  Sorry. That's your recipe.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.500]  Well, some cranberry and OK, yeah, that could be good.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.660]  I've never combined those flavors.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.280]  So you slice the cranberry.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.600]  Do you have any seasoning?
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.960]  Do you make like a cranberry sandwich out of the slices of cranberry with potato?
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.620]  No, you put this you put this in the turkey.
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.240]  Oh, you put it in the turkey.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.920]  Yeah, this is the actual stuffing.
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.540]  Oh, this is stuffing. Yeah, I see.
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.280]  Have you tried this?
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.500]  Is this like a family tradition that happened since I was a kid?
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.360]  Thanksgiving every year as a child in England.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.280]  This is what this is.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.100]  What was in my turkey?
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.940]  The worst part about this is I feel like we have to cook a turkey with this
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:52.400]  in it and just see what happens.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:52.940]  I'll be honest.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.880]  As soon as both these pictures came up, I thought, hmm, that's probably quite.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.020]  I could see there's like some seasoning.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.540]  I think you could do something with that blend of the potatoes.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:07.480]  Yeah, I think it's great.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.560]  That's really good, Gav.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.680]  For someone, honestly, for somebody who's not a native born American
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:18.020]  to come up with a Thanksgiving, a uniquely American recipe,
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:18.940]  I think you killed it.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:24.420]  I think you put the typical American amount of effort into a thing.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.880]  Oh, did you?
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:29.800]  Did you have something?
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:33.580]  Oh, I've got a uniquely American recipe that I came up with this year.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:38.060]  So you know how when you're like on your third day of leftovers,
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:39.700]  you get a little tired of the same stuff, right?
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:40.760]  So I wanted to experiment.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.440]  I had a bunch of leftover pecan pie.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.160]  I was like, I don't want to just eat it this way.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.400]  So I cut a huge slice of it and I dropped it into the blender
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:54.020]  with a couple of scoops of ice cream, vanilla, some chocolate chips
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:58.160]  and then just a bit of chocolate syrup and a splash of milk.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:03.180]  And you just blend that all up until you have a nice pumpkin pie milkshake.
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:06.800]  Now, if that's a little too sweet for you and also this isn't for you, Geoff,
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:11.060]  but you can cut that with a little bit of bourbon for some extra flavor.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.320]  That sounds great.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.580]  I feel like Geoff is really being left out of these because they have booze and milk.
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.100]  That's OK. That's OK.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.760]  I'm OK with milk as a component.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.680]  The booze, I don't think as well, but I will say listening,
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:27.700]  listening to Nick describe it was delicious.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:29.900]  Yeah, he did a great job.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.200]  Yeah, you did a fantastic job.
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:32.840]  You get that you get that radio voice down.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.100]  I really appreciate that Eric and Nick both went into, you know, their own.
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.520]  They have a personal story for it.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.180]  There seems to be some some layers to it.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:42.220]  It's not just a recipe.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.240]  Yeah, they went deep.
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:44.480]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:45.580]  What about you, Andrew?
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.120]  See, that's the thing.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.420]  I just crafted a recipe.
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:52.320]  I haven't I haven't made this yet, so I don't know if this is good or not.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:56.620]  I'll just I'll copy and paste my ingredients for my stuffing.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:01.720]  I switched up a little bit going with an untraditional bread choice,
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.800]  I would say, instead of like you standard bread challah.
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:06.000]  Use a challah loaf.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.020]  It's delicious.
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.280]  It's going to be a sweeter stuffing.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.720]  I imagine it also contains butter, melted kosher salt,
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:18.040]  freshly ground black pepper, olive oil, shallots, minced garlic, chopped rosemary,
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.580]  two Granny Smith apples and one cosmic crisp apple,
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.840]  chopped walnuts, pecans, low sodium chicken broth, half a teaspoon of cinnamon
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.180]  and a pinch of nutmeg.
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:28.800]  I think there's a good balance of flavors.
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.100]  It could be terrible.
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.340]  I haven't tried it yet.
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.540]  I need to try it.
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.480]  I'll try to do that this weekend.
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.260]  Oh, I would love to see if that's good.
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:37.720]  Because that's a lot of that is my recipe.
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.160]  It seems like a lot of work.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.740]  I also have instructions for making it, but I haven't done it yet.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:44.620]  So we'll see how accurate those are.
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.840]  OK, I think that looks delicious.
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.220]  I agree with you.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.780]  It is honestly not that different from mine, which is interesting.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.100]  I think we kind of went in similar places.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:59.200]  I did the same thing as you, Andrew, in that I haven't actually made my recipe yet.
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:05.060]  I kind of crafted it from kind of the bones of two different recipes.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.400]  But I'm so certain that my recipe is delicious.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.340]  That I'm going to put my name on it.
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.900]  And I'm so, so, so certain it's delicious.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.440]  I'm never going to cook it.
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:17.460]  I don't need to.
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.580]  I don't need to eat it.
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:19.900]  I know it's that good.
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.760]  I want the world to eat it.
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.040]  But I I've eaten it in my mind.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.160]  So just throwing that out there ahead of time.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.520]  Here's how my approach went.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.100]  I wanted to do the atypical American thing.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.940]  I wanted to put a lot of effort into work into this.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.400]  And I wanted I wanted this recipe to kind of speak for me
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.060]  and to be kind of of and about me.
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.220]  And so I wanted to figure out a way to make it unique.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.620]  And so I didn't know what that meant exactly,
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:45.920]  but I just knew that I was going to put it out into the world.
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:48.640]  Kind of like when when when Unifarm needs an idea,
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:51.120]  you kind of put it out into the world and then you just kind of see
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.160]  what comes at you, right?
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:55.660]  And so a lot of people probably don't know this as well.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:05:00.480]  But every Saturday, pretty much every Saturday, if I'm in town,
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.660]  Emily and I go to estate sales all over Austin
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:09.320]  and the surrounding central Texas areas because Emily is obsessed
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.780]  with buying stuff from dead women.
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:16.160]  No, it's just like it's just something to do.
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:20.100]  And, you know, you guys know about the tiny town and stuff like that shit is expensive.
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.880]  People are like, how the fuck do you have so much tiny town?
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.980]  It's because old ladies die all the time and it's old.
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.040]  It's old people stuff.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.000]  If you want Christmas decorations, go to an estate sale.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:33.600]  They're there. Old people hoard Christmas decorations.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.660]  That's why Emily has an entire storage unit full of it.
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.320]  It's been a whole running gag on the other podcast I do with Gus.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.420]  We had to rent a U-Haul truck to get all the storage.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.080]  We had to get... I'll send you guys a photo, actually.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.660]  We had to rent a U-Haul truck to move all of the Christmas stuff
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:50.680]  from our storage to our house this year.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.320]  Was it cheaper than renting a car?
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.520]  It was like 60 bucks, but it was better than doing the...
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.620]  filling up her SUV 17 times, going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:04.820]  Anyway, so every Saturday, we go out and we go to estate sales.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.660]  So I thought, I'm going to put it out in the universe that I'm looking for this recipe.
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:09.660]  This Saturday, we're going to estate sales.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.940]  I'm going to see what comes back at me.
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:15.560]  We end up in this area north of Austin that's like a retirement community, right?
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:19.280]  And they have a golf course on the retirement community.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.080]  And I thought, oh, it must be nice if you're into golfing
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.200]  and like it's right there for you, you never have to leave, right?
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:26.220]  We go into a house, go into their living room,
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:30.340]  and the living room is just one giant picture window of the golf course.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:34.800]  But like on the course, like I can see people putting on one of the greens.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.840]  I could throw a baseball and hit them. They're so close.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.400]  And I'm like, God damn, that's wild.
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:42.720]  And then I look around and everything in this house is themed golf.
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:46.680]  Like every glass and coffee cup is like a golf pun.
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:51.000]  And there's like golf flags from different places hanging from the walls.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.880]  And there's like little wooden golf figures everywhere.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:58.400]  And there's like fucking ashtrays that are golf shit.
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:06:59.960]  Everything is golf related.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:03.920]  And I'm kind of like looking at all these little knickknacks and kind of like laughing at how silly they are.
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:07.080]  And I see... I'm going to send you guys a picture.
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.180]  This catches my eye.
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:11.260]  I stopped talking too soon.
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:12.160]  Too powerful?
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:15.360]  OK. This catches my eye.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:19.540]  God damn it, how can it be too powerful?
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.240]  Eric, can we get Nitro for Discord?
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:29.540]  I just got... I was emailing with not our finance people,
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:34.980]  but going above them to our finance financiers and saying, how do I unblock this earlier this week?
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:37.380]  OK, so I apologize.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.160]  I apologize. It's going up in slack right now.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.100]  I stumble upon this on their shelf.
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:51.760]  Oh, it is a cookbook called Favorite Recipes from the Ramsey Golf and Country Club
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.800]  from Ramsey, New Jersey.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:01.900]  And I think to myself, a recipe book from the country, from a country club, from a place called Ramsey, New Jersey.
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.120]  The city, the town is named after me.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:07.140]  The country club and the golf course are named after me.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:08.160]  And it's spelled right.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:09.760]  And it's spelled right.
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:14.620]  So I buy the Favorite Recipes book and thinking, oh, this is awesome.
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:15.940]  There's sure to be something in there.
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:23.440]  Sure enough, on page 31 or no, I'm sorry, on page 63.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:28.700]  There is a recipe for Waldorf stuffing and I think like, oh, great.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:34.560]  But then I feel like it's like it's like speaks to me and I'm like, oh, maybe I'll use this or I'll figure out I'll use it as the base.
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:42.240]  Then Emily's family comes into town for Thanksgiving and her uncle Daryl makes his own stuffing and it's fucking delicious.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.020]  And I'm like, oh, my God, I got the stuffing right here in front of me.
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.180]  This thing is phenomenal.
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:48.720]  His was like a traditional stuffing.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:51.000]  The one on the recipe book is like a Waldorf stuffing.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:58.840]  And so after Daryl, after he left, I got thinking about it and I wanted to honor his stuffing in some way.
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:04.940]  So I combined the two recipes into this.
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:08.700]  Well, I can't put a fucking photo up.
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.140]  Here's my I call it Geoff and Daryl's.
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:14.500]  He has no idea I made this and it would probably creep him out if he did.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:22.560]  Geoff and Daryl's Waldorf wonder stuffing for as inspired by the people of the Ramsey Country Club in Ramsey, New Jersey.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.480]  And it is much like you, Andrew.
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:26.800]  It includes a cosmic crisp apple.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:35.720]  It includes I'm not going to I'm not going to go through the whole steps, but it includes onions, celery, lots of butter, dried breadcrumbs with two different ways to prepare them.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:44.400]  Salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, a little herb de Provence, some chopped pecans, water, egg, well-beaten orange peel zest.
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:50.180]  And I gave you specific instructions on how to cook it with two versions.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:55.960]  One, if you want it to be stuffing and one, if you only want it to be dressing, because they are two different things prepared slightly differently.
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:56.900]  Boom.
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:01.000]  Geoff and Daryl's Waldorf wonder stuffing for I think it needs grapes.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.260]  You don't know.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.200]  Celery, apples, walnuts, grapes, Waldorf.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:07.920]  No, I didn't need grapes.
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:09.760]  Oh, grapes don't work.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:10.720]  Don't don't work in a stuffing.
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:11.820]  That's fair.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.020]  I'd be weirded out if there were grapes.
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.300]  Grapes aren't stuffing food.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.360]  Anyway, so that's mine.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.160]  I put way too much time and effort into it.
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:26.520]  And anyway, shout out to the people of Ramsey, New Jersey.
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.960]  I didn't know you existed, but we are the same.
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.280]  You lived in New Jersey and didn't realize that was a Ramsey?
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.980]  No, I'd never heard of it.
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.380]  Yeah, I lived there for two years.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.160]  Shit.
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.500]  Wow, that's crazy.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.100]  Oh, Eric said we should wrap up.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:38.700]  Yeah, we should.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.280]  Thank you for everybody for submitting your recipes.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:48.600]  I'll if you guys could send them to me in recipe form, I will make sure they go up on Instagram at some point.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:51.540]  And hopefully audience, if you guys want to give them a try.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.040]  I know a lot of people made our sauces.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.000]  Feel free. Let us know how they are.
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:11:00.900]  I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure mine's going to work well, but I'll never know because I'm never going to eat it or make it.
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.520]  Oh, and I guess we should end the podcast now.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.300]  One last thing I saw somebody asked me the other day what my progress on the Geoff Achievement was.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.320]  And so it is 72 percent.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.780]  Oh, that's where I am getting close.
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:18.400]  Yeah, but I'm actually it's actually misleading.
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:22.720]  It's it's I am at 72 percent, but I'm in a much better, much stronger place than that.
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:30.840]  I need about one point eight million souls to spend on all the things I need to buy to upgrade.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.260]  And I'm at like one point two million right now.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:39.100]  So I don't have the I don't have the metals I need, but I've I've spent some time just grinding out souls.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:42.460]  And so I'm actually I got enough souls for like 90 percent.
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.740]  Wow. How many how long will it take you to get that extra 10 percent?
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:47.080]  What do you say? I have no idea.
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.160]  I should have this achievement within a year.
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.860]  So it's not like you can't consistently.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.400]  What the fuck is going on?
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:56.040]  Stop. Shut up.
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:57.300]  Shut up.
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.180]  Everyone shut up.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.760]  End the podcast.
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:02.560]  What's happening? You did it.
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:04.040]  You did the outro.
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.300]  And then now it's just questions about Gems of War.
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:07.360]  That could be the next episode.
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.360]  Well, no, we've got other stuff to talk about.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.320]  No! Oh my God.
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:12.460]  We got I got I got notes.
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:13.400]  We got lots of notes.
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:17.320]  Well, most of them are for tomorrow, which is confusing because it looks like more notes than that.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.120]  Maybe I don't have a lot.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.180]  Anyway, thanks for listening to F*** Face.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:20.760]  Bye.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:25.360]  Hey, guys. Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.840]  Andrew has a new website.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:29.080]  Let's look at Gavin's life hacks.
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.640]  Hatton tries to make a grilled cheese at his desk.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.660]  Salt licorice is the worst.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.740]  Can you think of food shaped like animals?
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:39.440]  Geoff loves Bozo the Clown and defends Ronald McDonald's honor.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.020]  What happened to the grimace?
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:42.880]  Where did the cucumber come from?
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:49.340]  And once again, Andrew is a huge fan of the Annual Pass podcast, available at YouTube.com slash Annual Pass.
