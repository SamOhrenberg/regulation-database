[00:14.960 --> 00:15.360]  I
[00:15.360 --> 00:20.520]  Was not earlier than noon technically it was 1159 when he jumped in on my it wasn't I'm just letting you know
[00:20.520 --> 00:26.560]  I'm saying like all I'm saying. I'm saying is that it was on my clock. That's all do we need to not accusing you of anything?
[00:27.040 --> 00:32.740]  I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm just I'm simply stating. It was it was 1159
[00:32.740 --> 00:39.680]  Well, hold on a second. Hello and welcome to another episode of the face podcast Eric. What number is this? This is 135
[00:39.680 --> 00:40.180]  5
[00:40.860 --> 00:41.300]  episode
[00:42.740 --> 00:47.780]  135 probably my name is Geoff Ramsey with me as always Gavin free and Andrew Pantin and
[00:47.780 --> 00:53.620]  Gavin you were one minute early today. You've never been early in your life. Why did you decide to change things up?
[00:53.960 --> 00:56.880]  I wasn't early. I was I joined exactly
[00:57.420 --> 00:58.640]  12 o'clock this
[01:01.080 --> 01:05.540]  You yeah, you warned us about this I think that this is some jet lag stuff for you
[01:05.540 --> 01:08.860]  I think you're maybe a little like your time hasn't quite caught up
[01:08.860 --> 01:10.880]  You know, it's solved this issue wrong
[01:12.020 --> 01:19.420]  Passage of time sync up every week. I use a perfectly synchronized GPS clock to join at exactly
[01:20.140 --> 01:24.280]  12 this is I don't know if it's the angle that this is taken out or whatever
[01:24.280 --> 01:28.740]  But it's like giving me a headache to look at it. Like yeah, it's good. It's really hard to read
[01:28.740 --> 01:33.260]  I think I could expose lower Christ, but I literally I wait until
[01:33.780 --> 01:39.860]  1159 and then I wait probably halfway through the next second and then I click so that as it turns to 12
[01:39.860 --> 01:42.380]  I'm in the recording and I do that every week
[01:42.380 --> 01:48.640]  I was looking at the time on my computer waiting to see when it was gonna start and it was 1159 when I heard you
[01:48.640 --> 01:55.820]  Ding in yep me too. Yeah, it was definitely close. I don't why would you buy that that clock?
[01:56.140 --> 01:59.220]  I didn't buy I built it you built it. Okay
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.080]  Why a hobby?
[02:03.260 --> 02:08.680]  It looks like you stole it from the world shittiest scoreboard like it I don't I don't know what I'm looking at
[02:10.100 --> 02:10.760]  It's just
[02:16.220 --> 02:21.080]  All right, let me I mean I respect that you made it but this is that's yeah
[02:21.080 --> 02:25.000]  It's the I trust this clock even less now that I know you made it
[02:26.840 --> 02:32.620]  Yeah, no, it's a tough argument when the clock you made is wrong and arguing. It's right. That's I just put it together
[02:32.620 --> 02:33.200]  I didn't like
[02:34.740 --> 02:35.840]  Well, what do you mean? No?
[02:36.480 --> 02:42.040]  Well, all right. Come on. Wow. What does that mean? It's like a kid. I sold it it together
[02:42.820 --> 02:45.500]  Okay, that's a little bit more hands-on than I expected
[02:46.520 --> 02:50.880]  It would be like the way you phrased it would be like if you built the Lego set and said I invented this
[02:50.880 --> 02:51.620]  It's thing is
[02:54.140 --> 02:56.460]  Invented Lego Hogwarts. I
[02:56.460 --> 03:02.440]  You can't set it. It's literally just has like an antenna for the GPS. That's all that happen. Well, okay
[03:02.620 --> 03:05.580]  This is the problem that you're overlooking that room is dumb
[03:05.580 --> 03:11.320]  We have some establishing that this room is stupid due to all the air your clock is dumb
[03:11.320 --> 03:14.240]  It's like that clock is breathing. Nothing but CO2
[03:14.240 --> 03:16.860]  very possible I
[03:16.860 --> 03:21.760]  Want to say that the second picture that you sent great you can read it perfectly
[03:21.760 --> 03:24.740]  I agree before it looked like the worst scoreboard now, it's great
[03:24.740 --> 03:32.320]  I also want to say that with Gavin saying I built a clock and seeing this it all makes sense to me
[03:32.320 --> 03:37.620]  And I get it if this were flipped and Andrew was saying I built the clock
[03:37.620 --> 03:41.720]  I don't know where this episode would go or what we would be doing
[03:41.720 --> 03:48.880]  But time would just be like a concert. We would be like drilling down into like tenet style situations
[03:52.040 --> 03:57.840]  To build well, what type of clock are we talking one? That's apparently a cut by 10 seconds too fast
[03:58.340 --> 04:03.500]  Yeah, I could do that I could build a clock that incorrectly told time no problem
[04:03.500 --> 04:05.280]  I mean look look, that's what we could do
[04:05.280 --> 04:14.660]  I can take a picture of the clock the second I press stop, right? Yeah, we can take the length of the audio clip and
[04:16.140 --> 04:22.000]  Deduct it from the current time to see when I joined. I checked out three words into the sentence
[04:24.100 --> 04:27.720]  Yeah, you do I'm sure you're right I'd rather just say you're right
[04:27.840 --> 04:30.820]  And then we can move on. Please do that and then
[04:31.620 --> 04:35.280]  Explain it in some way that makes us not trust that you're right and then we can move on
[04:37.880 --> 04:39.520]  I'm definitely gonna forget to do that
[04:41.900 --> 04:46.840]  How are you doing buddy you texted you texted us all earlier and said you were gonna be loopy from jetlag
[04:47.540 --> 04:53.200]  Yeah, well, yeah jetlag. Yeah, so my body just decided that it was morning about 4 a.m
[04:53.200 --> 04:54.880]  So I've just been up for ages
[04:54.880 --> 04:59.260]  What did you do from 4 a.m. Until you would have normally gotten up?
[05:00.200 --> 05:05.500]  Yeah, did you get up put clothes on and like walk around the house or do you lay in bed you did no
[05:05.500 --> 05:10.040]  I can't lay in bed. I hate that. That's just so boring. You're just wasting. What are you serious?
[05:10.460 --> 05:15.120]  No, I hate being in bed. Get out of here. I've spent last night
[05:15.120 --> 05:18.080]  Just like I laid in bed for probably two hours last night
[05:18.080 --> 05:22.620]  Oh, no ways like when it when when evenings coming around when it's good to be about like 1145
[05:23.100 --> 05:27.660]  I'm just annoyed that I've got a stop and I want it to skip the next day
[05:27.660 --> 05:33.160]  Are you serious as soon as it turns dark? I start to feel like I'm ready for bed
[05:33.160 --> 05:37.320]  I'm ready for bed by 6 p.m. Every day now because it's dark early in Texas
[05:37.320 --> 05:42.120]  We we watched we've been trying to watch like one Christmas thing a day and I was
[05:42.120 --> 05:47.620]  Struggling yawning through home alone last night. And as soon as it was over, I was like I had to go to fucking bed
[05:47.620 --> 05:51.560]  I am exhausted from another year's watching of home alone because it makes me laugh
[05:51.560 --> 05:55.700]  So goddamn much and I looked at my clock. It was 748 and I was like, oh fuck
[05:55.700 --> 05:58.080]  I can't go to bed for at least another hour and 10 minutes
[05:58.080 --> 06:03.600]  I've watched home alone with you before and you would think that it's do a favorite movie it is
[06:04.260 --> 06:07.960]  You know, I never considered but it does feel very much like a Geoff movie
[06:07.960 --> 06:12.840]  It makes his love of the most recent one make more sense. Like it you love genre wise
[06:12.840 --> 06:19.120]  Yeah, you got a guy doing pranks and stevious. It feels very Geoff. There is nothing on
[06:19.120 --> 06:27.080]  Earth funnier than when it becomes 9 p.m. on the night of the robbery and
[06:28.440 --> 06:34.180]  Macaulay Culkin or Kevin Macalester gets he just gets home from stopping by the church to pray before he
[06:34.180 --> 06:38.180]  Unleashes hell on these two idiots and then they pull up and they're like it's nine o'clock
[06:38.180 --> 06:42.920]  Let's get to it from that second on until honestly until he
[06:43.460 --> 06:48.500]  Cuts the cord on the ziploc line that that that like I don't know
[06:48.500 --> 06:51.060]  It's like eight minutes is like the funniest eight or ten minutes
[06:52.060 --> 06:56.420]  And I can't not laugh his I was I've seen that movie
[06:56.420 --> 07:03.080]  I saw it in the theater five times in a row in five days of high school because the year I turned 16
[07:03.080 --> 07:06.380]  It was out and I went every day to the dollar theater to see it
[07:06.380 --> 07:12.500]  I've seen it a thousand times, but I left just as I was I have I had spit coming out of my mouth
[07:12.500 --> 07:17.260]  I was laughing so I was drooling last night laughing so hard. I'll be honest that movie soundtrack
[07:18.140 --> 07:22.780]  Absolutely slaps. It's an amazing soundtrack. How old were you when you watched Home Alone Gavin?
[07:23.820 --> 07:27.780]  You remember like you watch this like a little kid or do you watch it later? Yeah, I must have been seven
[07:28.340 --> 07:35.760]  Yeah, I feel especially lucky to have seen that movie as a child because of the neighbor being genuinely scary
[07:35.760 --> 07:41.720]  Like watching that as a little kid and being terrified by the guy that just is like clearing snow out of his driveway
[07:41.720 --> 07:45.340]  I think adds to that experience that what do they call him the South Bend?
[07:47.360 --> 07:50.360]  Stalker or yeah, I haven't seen it in a long time
[07:50.360 --> 07:54.200]  But but I just remember as a kid being genuinely terrified of that character
[07:54.200 --> 07:58.680]  And I just don't think I would have had that experience if I watched it when I was older. He's a pretty feeble old, dude
[07:58.680 --> 07:59.280]  Yeah
[08:00.300 --> 08:03.580]  Seeing it later in life. There's nothing really scary about him
[08:03.580 --> 08:08.600]  It is very clearly like these kids creating this narrative got through the course of watching holiday movies
[08:09.260 --> 08:10.960]  Trying to watch holiday programs
[08:11.620 --> 08:14.960]  Cuz Emily insists that we watch one piece of Christmas content a day
[08:14.960 --> 08:20.380]  sometimes it can be like a five-minute Looney Tunes cartoon or what it's like HBO Max as it says it's like a
[08:20.380 --> 08:25.400]  different present to unwrap each day and it's like a different show and then like Peacock has some different like you could go watch an
[08:25.400 --> 08:26.860]  episode of ALF Christmas or whatever
[08:27.980 --> 08:28.840]  We watched
[08:29.580 --> 08:33.400]  Fucking what is it called spirited the other night that Will Ferrell?
[08:33.400 --> 08:33.780]  Uh
[08:35.340 --> 08:43.220]  What's the other dude their own Ryan Reynolds movie the new one my god that movie is long
[08:43.220 --> 08:47.240]  Not super good. It's a musical first of all, which is fine
[08:47.240 --> 08:50.080]  They wanted to make a musical but there's no reason for it to be a musical
[08:50.080 --> 08:52.860]  There's no point neither of them are particularly good singers
[08:52.860 --> 08:59.760]  The songs aren't particularly funny if you cut the musical part out, it would be an okay 90-minute movie
[08:59.760 --> 09:01.560]  But it is just dry
[09:01.560 --> 09:06.300]  It's like a Wes Anderson movie where you like you think the movie's over and they're like, no, there's an entire other movie
[09:06.300 --> 09:09.320]  I mean, is there a reason for any movie to be a musical?
[09:09.760 --> 09:15.180]  I think if you've got like some particularly interesting songs and it can tell a story in a way that
[09:15.800 --> 09:21.380]  That you that you wouldn't normally see it. Sure. I think so, but I don't want to hear Will Ferrell sing. That's fair
[09:21.380 --> 09:25.800]  He's not a Dina Menzel. You know, it's like it's different. He's not Adele Nazeem
[09:27.680 --> 09:28.400]  Adele Nazeem
[09:30.440 --> 09:35.460]  Yeah, like Willy Wonka, should that have been a musical? I mean it could be I'm sure if you get somebody who's talented in that
[09:35.460 --> 09:40.500]  Space they can make that into a good musical. It was a musical. I'm saying like should it have been. Oh, it was?
[09:40.600 --> 09:41.040]  I had no idea
[09:41.980 --> 09:43.860]  Have you never seen Willy Wonka the Chocolate Factory?
[09:44.640 --> 09:48.840]  No, I guess I just don't know. Yeah, I don't associate that as a musical, but you're right
[09:48.840 --> 09:52.260]  They're definite. I just don't think of when I think of classic musicals
[09:52.260 --> 09:54.520]  I don't think of Willy Wonka in that category, but you're not wrong
[09:54.520 --> 09:57.720]  But I think it would have worked if instead of like whenever a kid got
[09:57.720 --> 10:03.640]  Obliterated if the Oompa Loompas just came out and just sort of mopped up the blood and left without a song it would have been fine
[10:03.640 --> 10:08.920]  Isn't that what the Tim Burton movie is? I don't know. I feel like that's the Tim Burton version and that was terrible
[10:08.920 --> 10:15.540]  Once again though the Oompa Loompas those songs were fucking awesome, and they add to the movie. Nothing Ryan Reynolds saying added to that
[10:17.160 --> 10:21.120]  What has been the best piece of Christmas content that you've consumed this year?
[10:21.700 --> 10:28.380]  Outside of established classics, what's a new Christmas? I'll tell you what I fuck. What's the the best? I don't know
[10:28.380 --> 10:31.260]  I haven't seen a lot of oh, you know what it's not great
[10:31.680 --> 10:36.860]  It's actually not very good at all, but I this the the sequel to Christmas Story
[10:36.860 --> 10:43.200]  I watched that the Peter you know Peter Billingsley, and it's a it's it's rough for the first like 30 minutes
[10:43.200 --> 10:46.160]  But once you buy in it's got a lot of heart and charm
[10:46.160 --> 10:48.580]  And I'll say like I enjoyed it by the end of it
[10:48.580 --> 10:52.560]  I thought I I thought it was a pretty faithful sequel. You can see how it goes
[10:53.180 --> 10:58.280]  From a mile away obviously, but it's just like a happy family Christmas movie right. I thought they did a decent job
[10:59.140 --> 11:03.860]  I thought they did a decent job of of adding on to that story without like beating you to death with it
[11:03.860 --> 11:07.340]  What's a sequel to a Christmas story? Oh?
[11:07.420 --> 11:09.460]  What were you watching a Christmas like to?
[11:11.180 --> 11:13.680]  Christmas story I was like Christmas stories the sequel
[11:13.680 --> 11:14.520]  Yeah
[11:17.520 --> 11:22.620]  What if there's just several Christmas stories that were unrelated it's just like a title completely different movies
[11:22.620 --> 11:28.200]  I think that movie Christmas story. I think it's gonna get some hate for this. I think it's a dogshit film
[11:28.200 --> 11:31.000]  That's a wrong take yeah. Yeah, I don't like it
[11:31.000 --> 11:36.660]  I don't think it's a dogshit film, but I would be happy never to see it again having had to watch it
[11:36.660 --> 11:43.660]  Yeah, Christmas my entire life. I
[11:43.660 --> 11:49.960]  Like the way they promote it definitely overplayed calling it a shit movie. I think it's strong. I mean, it's no Christmas vacation
[11:51.280 --> 11:53.580]  Same same same boat for me seen it
[11:53.580 --> 11:53.800]  Yeah
[11:53.800 --> 11:58.120]  Too many fucking times also from the moment he goes up into the attic and he starts watching
[11:58.120 --> 12:04.040]  Family films the movie just grinds to a halt if they there's like there's like a solid 22 minutes
[12:04.040 --> 12:08.380]  They could cut out of this like the five eight five it's the way through that movie that they could just
[12:08.380 --> 12:14.920]  Flush and get right back to Cousin Eddie and it'd be good that shot of his shins coming through the ceiling and landing
[12:16.380 --> 12:16.820]  I
[12:18.980 --> 12:25.340]  Remember watching the first time seeing that the scene where he he's like putting up Christmas lights and he falls and he grabs the gutter
[12:25.340 --> 12:29.940]  And the gutter launches through the window. I'd maybe the hardest I'd laughed in my life to that point
[12:29.940 --> 12:35.640]  I remember like going back and rewinding on VHS and watching in like slow-mo like frame by frame of the gutter flying out
[12:36.300 --> 12:38.740]  Great movie has an amazing seats
[12:39.220 --> 12:43.160]  Have I ever told you guys a story about when I was in high school?
[12:43.360 --> 12:46.960]  And I worked as a as a tool repairman for like the last year and a half
[12:46.960 --> 12:50.080]  I was in high school before I joined the army. No, and I
[12:51.040 --> 12:57.820]  this really sweet really sweet old dude who was like obsessed with Paul Harvey and he only had one arm and he was
[12:57.820 --> 13:00.940]  He was just like a really fucking badass dude who could do anything
[13:00.940 --> 13:05.140]  He'd worked in the tool like in the oil fields his entire life and had done all this with only one arm
[13:05.140 --> 13:09.560]  and he opened up a tool repair shop and he would hire high school students and he tried to give me the business he
[13:09.560 --> 13:11.140]  Was trying to retire and I was like no offense
[13:11.140 --> 13:14.520]  But I don't want to be a tool repairman for the rest of my life. And so I joined the army
[13:14.940 --> 13:16.980]  but really lovely dude and
[13:16.980 --> 13:17.880]  he would
[13:19.060 --> 13:23.860]  He taught me about productivity and about being efficient and working at all times
[13:23.860 --> 13:29.540]  and like there was if there weren't tools to fix and I was a hydraulic electronic and
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.700]  Pneumatic tool repairman so any kind of pneumatic drill any kind of like electric bandsaw
[13:35.700 --> 13:41.160]  Any a lot of pumps like a lot of pneumatic pumps for like tugboats and shit. We would fix and
[13:42.300 --> 13:45.800]  He was always kind of scraping by and so whenever we would run out of stuff to do
[13:45.800 --> 13:51.620]  He would tell me to get creative and come up with work and one of his favorite things to have me do would be to
[13:51.620 --> 13:53.560]  pull nails out of old
[13:53.560 --> 14:00.460]  Lumber and then straighten the nails and then regrind points on the nails and then save them so that
[14:00.990 --> 14:06.860]  Like he was that he was that level of cheap one time. He came into work and he had
[14:06.860 --> 14:08.380]  he had like
[14:09.140 --> 14:15.140]  three 55 gallon or like 50 gallon drums full of batteries that he had found in an industrial dumpster and he goes
[14:15.140 --> 14:20.500]  These might be bad. They might but we're gonna find out they were all like a set like double a D
[14:20.500 --> 14:26.300]  C-cell and I spent like an entire Saturday testing batteries to see which ones were good and which ones are bad like this the kind
[14:26.300 --> 14:28.700]  of stuff he had me do all the time and
[14:28.700 --> 14:31.340]  so he would leave for a while and he would just say like
[14:31.340 --> 14:36.760]  Find something productive to do and a lot of what I would do is I would fill I would find old broken
[14:37.380 --> 14:39.760]  like saw like bandsaws or
[14:39.760 --> 14:46.300]  like hammer drills and I would try to rebuild them so he could sell them as used tools from like discarded pieces and
[14:46.300 --> 14:51.160]  And we were in this giant warehouse that was like 30 feet tall, I guess, maybe? I don't know.
[14:51.180 --> 14:56.020]  It was a tall-ass warehouse, and he had built these out of recycled wood, which goes into this,
[14:56.120 --> 15:01.300]  I think, a little bit. He had built these, um, shelves that went all the way to the top that
[15:01.300 --> 15:06.440]  were just covered in just whatever nonsense, you know, bullshit that he had accumulated and
[15:06.440 --> 15:10.300]  collected. And I would climb up there to look for, like, tool parts and stuff, and there was
[15:10.300 --> 15:14.820]  one that he had that was suspended from the ceiling by chains, and it was just like...
[15:15.260 --> 15:19.060]  It was like a wooden flat that was suspended by chains from the ceiling,
[15:19.440 --> 15:24.340]  just hanging loose, and you had to, like, climb up on this one really tall shelf to jump over
[15:24.340 --> 15:27.540]  to it, and there was, like, some kind of something up there that I saw that I thought I could fuck
[15:27.540 --> 15:31.460]  with. And so I went up there to get it, and then I liked being up there because you could, like,
[15:31.460 --> 15:34.480]  kind of swing on it, and it felt dangerous as fuck because you're, like, 25 feet in the air
[15:34.480 --> 15:40.400]  swinging on some fucking rotten wood. And, uh, and I got up there, and then I realized that I
[15:40.400 --> 15:47.240]  was having... that it was a little scary to get down, and, uh, I, uh, I just picked a clean spot,
[15:47.380 --> 15:51.540]  like, on the top of a shelf, and I jumped down to it, and I guess I was just high enough up,
[15:51.560 --> 15:58.860]  and the... and the wood was old and free enough to be rickety or rotten. I fell straight through
[15:58.860 --> 16:06.620]  that shelf into the next shelf up to my, like, up to my chest, and so my legs were dangling,
[16:06.620 --> 16:13.960]  and my arms were above me, and I was, like, suspended maybe 18 feet in the air on, like,
[16:14.720 --> 16:19.260]  the fourth out of, like, five... maybe, like, the fifth out of, like, six shelves high. I went
[16:19.260 --> 16:23.700]  totally through the sixth shelf into the fifth and embedded kind of like Clark Griswold, and I
[16:23.700 --> 16:29.740]  was fucking physically stuck, and I had to stay there like that for, like, 30 minutes until he
[16:29.740 --> 16:35.580]  came back to get something and saw me, and I was like, Dean! Dean, help! I heard the door open up,
[16:35.580 --> 16:39.880]  and he had to run in and figure out how to get me out of there. He, like, he, like, pulled me loose,
[16:40.480 --> 16:45.120]  but I was, like, suspended in the air, like, 18-20 feet up in the air with, like, just, like,
[16:45.160 --> 16:51.760]  fucking rusty saws and shit all around me. Like, it's amazing I didn't fucking die, and, uh, just
[16:51.760 --> 16:58.300]  like a movie, completely stuck for a good half hour. I cried for a little bit. I laughed for a
[16:58.300 --> 17:02.840]  little bit. Like, I went through all the emotions. I was, like, 16. Were you crying because you
[17:02.840 --> 17:07.340]  thought you might get more hurt? Like, or just... I think I was crying because it was a Saturday
[17:07.340 --> 17:15.880]  morning, and I thought, what if he doesn't come back? I'm gonna die up here. Your 127 hours moment
[17:15.880 --> 17:23.180]  is just stuck in the shelf. I was just wedged in so fucking tight, I couldn't get anywhere. It
[17:23.180 --> 17:29.340]  sucked. Wouldn't you just love to see a montage of all your greatest falls and blunders like that?
[17:29.340 --> 17:36.460]  Yeah. Because, Geoff, I'm sure you would have... I'm sure you would have the best montage of anyone
[17:36.460 --> 17:41.760]  I've ever met. You fall and flip through the air and bounce so well. There's, like, an alternate
[17:41.760 --> 17:51.440]  reality where you're, like, a Jim Carrey level. I say this, uh, not to be braggadocious, but I
[17:51.440 --> 17:57.160]  assume I have forgotten about more falls and trips and blunders like that than most people have in a
[17:57.160 --> 18:02.940]  lifetime. Do you remember the one where we got an achievement in Gears 2, and then we tried to do
[18:02.940 --> 18:17.320]  a diving high five onto the beanbag that you... I lost count. Yeah. He's just dying. We didn't hear
[18:17.320 --> 18:25.880]  you, Geoff, but I won. What was the story? I didn't do it. It died out. It was like you walked away
[18:25.880 --> 18:30.720]  from the conversation. I basically did. But Geoff was focused so much on nailing the high
[18:30.720 --> 18:38.540]  five part that he completely overshot the beanbag. And something about Geoff's old living room floor,
[18:38.860 --> 18:44.360]  it was so loud. Whenever he fell on it, it was like an earth shattering boom. I've got, like,
[18:44.400 --> 18:50.080]  I think two videos of, uh, Geoff just falling in his living room. Like, one was that dive,
[18:50.480 --> 18:54.740]  and the other one was like, uh, I can't remember what it was. We were just filming. I think it was
[18:54.740 --> 18:59.640]  the webcam of my laptop we were filming. And, uh, you tried to hit me in the nuts at the beginning
[18:59.640 --> 19:03.360]  of the video. And then I tried to hit you in the nuts, and you sort of went out of frame,
[19:03.540 --> 19:09.360]  and you could just hear you slam. It sounds like you slammed into the ground at like 45 miles an
[19:09.360 --> 19:14.140]  hour from a standing position. I bet we can, uh, I bet I can trim those out and post them.
[19:14.540 --> 19:19.080]  Because I, uh, I don't like the half-assed things. Yeah. Even though you don't see the fall in one of
[19:19.080 --> 19:25.080]  them, the noise is absolutely phenomenal. And then I think you said you slipped because you had your
[19:25.080 --> 19:33.720]  sockies on. I would pay a premium for a loud floor. If every impact could just sound massive,
[19:33.860 --> 19:38.560]  I would pay so much money for that specific material. Like a, like a wrestling ring floor?
[19:39.040 --> 19:42.960]  Yeah, exactly. I'd love that. I bet you've got a great montage too, Andrew.
[19:44.080 --> 19:48.840]  Yeah, I have a few. I have a few. It's just like, it's just Andrew Panton, the ankle sessions.
[19:51.620 --> 19:55.780]  I think, I think mine would be a lot of mundane. Like you'd look at it and go,
[19:55.960 --> 20:00.260]  that's what kept you out for two days? You're just stepping off a curb. Like,
[20:00.420 --> 20:05.300]  I think it would be great in a different way. I don't have anything that's comparable to being
[20:05.300 --> 20:13.040]  stuck in a literal shelf. I, I, I one time was, uh, it was not in the army. I was like,
[20:13.640 --> 20:18.300]  I was maybe 19. And we were, we went to like, if you lived in Fort Hood, if you went to Fort Hood,
[20:18.300 --> 20:21.980]  if you went to, if you were in the army, you went to Fort Hood, uh, you would understand this,
[20:22.040 --> 20:26.960]  but you got the fuck out of Fort Hood every, like the second you could every week. And so that's how
[20:26.960 --> 20:30.920]  I ended up falling in love with Austin was I would drive down to Austin just to go to bookstores
[20:30.920 --> 20:36.700]  or coffee shops after work and just spend as much time. Like I'd get out of work at like five and
[20:36.700 --> 20:40.240]  I'd start driving to Austin and I'd come home at like two in the morning, go back to sleep and get
[20:40.240 --> 20:44.840]  up at five, like 5am to do PT and just get no sleep just to pretend like I didn't live in the
[20:44.840 --> 20:49.420]  army. Uh, but one time we were in, so we were, we'd go on weekend trips a lot. We went to San
[20:49.420 --> 20:53.540]  Antonio. It wasn't the trip that I told you guys about where I almost got run over by the train.
[20:53.540 --> 21:00.200]  And then the, the scary car opened up all the doors. Uh, same dudes, same dudes, same city,
[21:00.320 --> 21:04.760]  different weekend. And we were walking around the, um, the Riverwalk, which I really like
[21:04.760 --> 21:09.600]  cause it's gross and touristy, but it's also where the chase scene in cloak and dagger happened,
[21:09.640 --> 21:12.780]  which is one of my favorite childhood movies. Cause I thought Dabney Coleman was like the
[21:12.780 --> 21:17.520]  coolest fucking dude ever. And, uh, so I, I love to go down there anytime I, anytime I get the
[21:17.520 --> 21:24.300]  opportunity. And, uh, there was like a local TV crew filming, uh, just people walking down. I
[21:24.300 --> 21:28.000]  don't know. They were doing like a tourism segment or something. And I thought I was going to be
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.800]  funny and do like a little, like little, like kick my leg and spin in the air and like point
[21:32.800 --> 21:39.260]  at the thing as I was walking by. And I started to do that and I somehow tripped myself and kicked
[21:39.260 --> 21:46.140]  my own leg out from under me and fell fucking off like hard on the concrete next to the, uh,
[21:46.580 --> 21:51.420]  next to the edge, hit my head and rolled. Like I was probably like three feet from going over,
[21:51.580 --> 21:56.320]  but I was like, I got like, I like hit so hard and was so disoriented that I almost fell in the
[21:56.320 --> 22:01.120]  fucking Riverwalk. And some local, some, some San Antonio, like Fox affiliate probably still
[22:01.120 --> 22:08.480]  has that footage. I found a, I found a clip. Oh, did you really?
[22:10.280 --> 22:16.680]  Okay. Gavin is sharing a Vimeo link. Now this says 11 years ago, but I assure you, it was, uh,
[22:17.260 --> 22:22.380]  probably 15 years ago, actually, that it was filmed. Everyone ready up at zero. Yeah. Three,
[22:22.600 --> 22:27.280]  two, one play. Mine buffered. Got you an achievement.
[22:31.540 --> 22:36.520]  Mine's still buffering. Suddenly this video has had four people trying to watch it at the same time.
[22:37.280 --> 22:40.680]  It's working fine for me. Geoff just got me an achievement. Okay, here we go. What we get,
[22:40.920 --> 22:46.560]  we got for the Fallen. All right, here we go. It's an achievement I've been missing for about
[22:46.560 --> 22:54.780]  two years. It's our celebration. I totally missed the beat back there.
[23:02.450 --> 23:06.610]  It's so loud. It's so loud. Just the impact.
[23:08.510 --> 23:14.350]  The camera shakes. Well, it's like a, it was like an 85 year old pier and beam house. So
[23:15.210 --> 23:26.530]  yeah, I think that was 2009 or 2007. God, we've known each other for a very long time. We've
[23:26.530 --> 23:33.710]  been hanging out for a very long time. Yes. That's ridiculous. So what still never found
[23:33.710 --> 23:43.570]  anybody we liked more? Yeah, that must, that must have been 2009. That's wild.
[23:44.290 --> 23:49.050]  What happened to the woodshop guy, Geoff? I don't know. I joined the army. He,
[23:49.290 --> 23:53.030]  I think he hired another high school student. It was like part of a work placement program.
[23:53.870 --> 23:57.350]  And he was like, yeah, now you're going in the army, but are you thinking about going in the
[23:57.350 --> 24:02.330]  army? But he thought I had a really, I'll be honest. He thought I had a really good brain
[24:02.330 --> 24:06.650]  and I was really, really smart and had a really good mind for fixing tools,
[24:06.770 --> 24:13.830]  but that I was awkward and my hands were stupid. Like, like I had the brain for it,
[24:13.850 --> 24:17.930]  but not the body for it or the dexterity, but he was like, but you could, but we could get you
[24:17.930 --> 24:21.710]  there. And he was like, I really, I'd really like to, to like pass this. I don't have a kid.
[24:21.750 --> 24:24.690]  I'd really like to pass this down to you someday. And this could be your business. And I was like,
[24:24.710 --> 24:29.450]  that's really, uh, humbling and gratifying and really sweet of you, but I want to go be a
[24:29.450 --> 24:33.330]  journalist. And I never saw him again. I think I, I think I went back and visited him once after
[24:33.330 --> 24:38.470]  basic training. He was still there. And then I went back like a year later and he, the shop was
[24:38.470 --> 24:44.790]  gone. Have you considered that he's jigsaw? You were the first jigsaw trap. The way you described
[24:44.790 --> 24:48.970]  it, you trapped yourself. There's blades everywhere. It's rusty. Like what happened? That's
[24:48.970 --> 24:53.930]  why I'm asking. I'm concerned. You may be patient zero, the jigsaw story. And you didn't even know
[24:53.930 --> 24:59.170]  that's entirely. I never considered that. I'm like the only one who got away.
[25:00.970 --> 25:02.530]  Inspired an entire franchise.
[25:03.150 --> 25:08.910]  I feel, I feel, uh, I, uh, I'm right up there with Carrie Elves and Chris Rock. I guess that's pretty
[25:08.910 --> 25:14.590]  fun. Yeah. Yeah. Did you see the people are posting their Spotify end of year stuff?
[25:14.810 --> 25:15.130]  Yeah.
[25:15.390 --> 25:21.870]  And then I guess in one of the Spotify UIs, when you come back to the app and your most
[25:21.870 --> 25:26.190]  recent podcast, it just says, hello there. But if you've just listened to this podcast,
[25:26.310 --> 25:34.850]  it just says, hello there. Someone posted a screenshot. I think it was on Instagram, but it
[25:34.850 --> 25:41.130]  was, that's fucking great. That's fucking awesome. This podcast name continues to reward.
[25:41.930 --> 25:45.970]  Oh, oh man. I was, I was talking about this with Gav, with, uh, your Gavin. I was talking about
[25:45.970 --> 25:52.330]  this with, uh, Gus and Eric yesterday. If we win that stupid insight award, then I think that we
[25:52.330 --> 25:57.950]  have fulfilled the purpose of the podcast to have somebody at an award ceremony where I hope there
[25:57.950 --> 26:03.050]  are like tables with tablecloths and people sitting around, uh, looking up at a, at a dais
[26:03.050 --> 26:09.370]  and somebody has to stand up there and say, award for best buddy podcast of 2022 goes to face.
[26:10.010 --> 26:15.090]  We'll be like, I was like, we won, we won the video. I don't know what else to do after that.
[26:15.630 --> 26:20.310]  We need to consider, I mean, things are looking good currently. I just pulled it up. We currently
[26:20.310 --> 26:28.190]  have 78% of the vote. The next person behind us is 9%. There's what, like three days left,
[26:28.570 --> 26:32.530]  two days, 13 hours. We're also, it's funny, they have a section of their website that's
[26:32.530 --> 26:37.910]  most popular categories. Best buddy podcast is most voted on. I'm assuming by a lot. So
[26:37.910 --> 26:43.570]  thanks so much to all the listeners. Thank you. Thank you so, so much. Thank you comment
[26:43.570 --> 26:48.430]  leavers. Thank you. We need to decide because the ceremony I think is in January. We should
[26:48.430 --> 26:53.950]  send somebody on our behalf to accept the award. Who'd we send? Who should we send? Greg?
[26:56.010 --> 27:03.370]  Greg? Should we send Jack? Yeah, Jack's up there. Yes. Greg or Jack. Someone. It's just something
[27:03.370 --> 27:07.130]  to consider because things are looking good. Don't want to jinx it, but... Do you know where the
[27:07.130 --> 27:13.550]  awards are? I have no idea. I think Eric might have a better idea. I'm looking. I've been
[27:13.550 --> 27:17.790]  looking. I couldn't find where they're actually doing this thing. I wonder if it's just a virtual
[27:17.790 --> 27:22.930]  thing. Yeah, it might be. But you know. There's a section of their site that's like we're having
[27:22.930 --> 27:27.370]  an in-person ceremony when I was looking at it. Here's the thing that worries me though. If you
[27:27.370 --> 27:34.110]  go to the bottom of the page, all Signal finalists are selected by the Signal Awards jury. Does that...
[27:35.810 --> 27:40.530]  I don't know. It just, that's a thing that just makes me... Well, I think that just means the
[27:40.530 --> 27:44.350]  finalists, like we're all finalists, right? Like they selected the finalists. Now the audience
[27:44.350 --> 27:50.830]  selects the winner. I guess so. It just still makes me... Yeah, I know. It's confusing. I've
[27:50.830 --> 27:55.870]  done a little bit of a deep dive into this. I think what it is is there's the People Signal
[27:55.870 --> 28:00.250]  Awards and then there's the Signal Awards. And I think those are two separate things.
[28:00.630 --> 28:07.270]  I think we are undeniably going to win a People Signal Award, but they may give the Signal Award
[28:07.270 --> 28:11.630]  to somebody, like a different... There's two awards, essentially, from my understanding of it.
[28:12.150 --> 28:18.170]  We could be screwed over by the jury. Well, don't be so sure. Gus told a story in that
[28:18.170 --> 28:22.590]  Anima podcast I did yesterday about how Roosteeth got fucked out of an award. I can't remember if
[28:22.590 --> 28:27.070]  it was a Webby or a Streamy, way, way, way back in the day. They did something similar to this where
[28:28.390 --> 28:34.050]  we, they let the audience vote and then like two days before voting ended, they locked down the
[28:34.050 --> 28:39.310]  voting and nobody else could vote anymore or see what the percentages were. And then when the awards
[28:39.310 --> 28:43.470]  were announced, suddenly our competition won, even though we had been up by like thousands of votes.
[28:44.010 --> 28:48.730]  Huh. Yeah. It is a wild move to do that while displaying the vote count, though.
[28:49.450 --> 28:54.650]  Yeah. That'd be insane. We'll see. We'll figure it out. Speaking of, I did that, I mentioned that
[28:54.650 --> 28:59.550]  on the podcast. We did that at the mall yesterday, which is back, and I bring that up because Eric
[28:59.550 --> 29:05.690]  is here. He can confirm. Eric, is the mall back or is the mall back? I was talking to Nick about
[29:05.690 --> 29:12.610]  this because he's editing that and I confirmed with him with the amount of background noise
[29:12.610 --> 29:22.350]  that we have throughout the entire show. Boy, the mall is back. We got there and sat at a food court
[29:22.350 --> 29:34.750]  that was mostly empty at 10.15 a.m. By 11 a.m., that place was packed on a Monday morning. Packed.
[29:35.130 --> 29:41.650]  Crazy. Crazy. It's back, baby. Now, I guess my question at this point would be, did the mall ever
[29:41.650 --> 29:46.190]  go away or did it go away from the mall? No, the mall went away hard. The mall went away? Okay.
[29:46.610 --> 29:51.970]  So there was there was a decline in the mall from your viewing. 2000 to 2021, the mall did not exist.
[29:52.490 --> 29:58.250]  But is that the mall's fault or your fault? No, it's the mall's fault. Okay. Well, society took a break.
[29:58.630 --> 30:02.450]  No, it's just like people got into outdoor malls. People got into strip malls. People got
[30:02.450 --> 30:06.410]  into places like South Park Meadows and The Domain and nobody went to indoor malls anymore. And they
[30:06.410 --> 30:12.250]  called half of them across America closed because of it. It was a huge thing. I knew the mall
[30:12.250 --> 30:19.590]  was in trouble when I lived in New Jersey and the mall near me started to allow cigarettes in the
[30:20.170 --> 30:24.130]  mall. Like in 98, you could walk around the mall and smoke cigarettes and just put them out on
[30:24.130 --> 30:28.250]  shit. And people started to and you were like, oh, I see where this is headed. Like they're going
[30:28.250 --> 30:33.890]  they're doing anything to get people in the store. They're like fucking they're like smoke your
[30:33.890 --> 30:38.610]  cigarettes and put them out on the wall. We don't care. Just show up. And it was what did the mall
[30:38.610 --> 30:44.170]  do to get you back? What was the move? How did you realize the mall was back? Well, it has nothing to
[30:44.170 --> 30:48.570]  do with the mall. It has to do with the fact that it was a cold rainy day and I wanted to get some
[30:48.570 --> 30:54.030]  exercise. And so I went to the mall because I thought it's indoors and it's big. So I could I
[30:54.030 --> 30:59.270]  could do a couple laps with the with the old mall walkers and imagine my surprise to find out that
[30:59.270 --> 31:03.710]  there were people in the end stores in the mall. It wasn't just a place for senior citizens to walk.
[31:06.010 --> 31:11.070]  I don't know if the mall has ever existed where I live. What you're describing is just outside of
[31:11.070 --> 31:16.790]  like the holiday season when the mall is packed. I feel like it's just always old people. Do you
[31:16.790 --> 31:23.370]  have a mall in Nanaimo like an indoor? Oh, oh, absolutely. We are Nanaimo's mall city. It's
[31:23.370 --> 31:29.190]  almost to a flaw. Like the concept of attracting people to the town. The idea was like malls are
[31:29.190 --> 31:34.870]  the future. We have like four malls. Oh, my God. How big is Nanaimo? It's not. It's like long,
[31:34.950 --> 31:41.810]  but it's not. I would say each mall is probably like 10 minutes apart. Really? Yeah. There's
[31:41.810 --> 31:48.030]  the same shit in them? No, they don't. There's like one main central mall that is massive
[31:48.030 --> 31:52.210]  compared to the other ones. The other ones are pretty tiny malls. Some don't even have a food
[31:52.210 --> 31:56.650]  court. Like they pulled out the food court. It's not great. Not a great mall scene, but a lot of
[31:56.650 --> 32:00.950]  malls to choose from. What if they linked them underground through rail like airport terminals?
[32:01.110 --> 32:06.110]  Now that would be fucking awesome. I'm all about that. You could. It's a straight line. They all
[32:06.110 --> 32:09.190]  line up perfectly. What do you mean it's a straight line? Everything's a straight line
[32:09.190 --> 32:13.850]  if you tunnel underground. No, you have to zigzag. Not all tunnels are straight.
[32:15.810 --> 32:20.590]  You've never taken a curve in a tunnel? Well, if I'm going around stuff. But what? You got a
[32:20.590 --> 32:27.310]  lot of tunnels already? No, what are you talking about? What? I'm saying if you put a marker down,
[32:27.390 --> 32:34.350]  right? On one mall. Yeah. If you shot a gun from one mall, it would go in the direction of the
[32:34.350 --> 32:38.970]  other malls, right? Like it would be perfect. They're lined up. They're lined up is what he's
[32:38.970 --> 32:44.470]  saying. Yeah, it's a straight shot. It's convenient. Yeah, that's my line under all of them.
[32:44.950 --> 32:49.510]  Yeah, I get what you're saying. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. But I'm saying even if they
[32:49.510 --> 32:52.030]  weren't all in a line, you could still put them together with straight lines.
[32:53.730 --> 32:58.790]  Maybe not one straight line. Yeah, there'd be turns if they weren't. My point was how easy
[32:58.790 --> 33:04.850]  it would be, Gavin. What a stupid conversation. We're arguing about nothing here. Eric chimed in
[33:04.850 --> 33:11.290]  to say, why would you shoot a gun? I don't know. I was just I was honestly, I was confused by what
[33:11.290 --> 33:15.190]  you were saying. It caught me off guard. I was trying to get my balance of just something that
[33:15.190 --> 33:22.370]  you can't turn. I have a question for Eric. And speaking of, well, stupid, stupid, stupid.
[33:24.730 --> 33:30.270]  So our pizza videos came out. Yeah. One of them's called Eating the Plowman's Pizza.
[33:30.650 --> 33:39.170]  Yeah. One of them's called Pizza Day. Pizza Day. And I think that one didn't have a thumbnail.
[33:40.010 --> 33:45.570]  Who's in charge of like our YouTube strategy? That's a great question.
[33:46.790 --> 33:51.630]  I think Gavin's gunning for a promotion is what I'm hearing.
[33:51.630 --> 33:56.250]  That's you know what, Geoff, you might be right. Gavin might be the one in charge of our YouTube
[33:56.250 --> 33:59.450]  strategy. I can get some meetings on your calendar and we'll get that going.
[34:01.510 --> 34:05.990]  I did have to slight the group to say, can we please have a thumbnail?
[34:08.670 --> 34:13.090]  And you know what? That's the kind of initiative we need in the YouTube strategist position.
[34:13.230 --> 34:16.710]  And that's why I'm nominating you for Face YouTube strategist.
[34:16.710 --> 34:25.330]  Gavin, you've been here long enough to know that if you bring something up,
[34:25.410 --> 34:30.170]  suddenly it's your responsibility to get it fixed for whatever reason that is.
[34:30.330 --> 34:37.510]  So why would you even do it? To be fair, the person who typically makes our thumbnails is
[34:37.510 --> 34:43.110]  Brendan in our content ops team, and he has been swamped and also was very sick.
[34:44.130 --> 34:46.550]  So... Fine, but YouTube automatically
[34:46.550 --> 34:51.870]  picks three frames from a video. Any one of those would have been better than just the black logo.
[34:52.390 --> 34:57.270]  Nah, I like the logo. Nick swooped in and saved the day.
[34:57.710 --> 35:01.730]  Yeah, because he is an underrated star of this podcast.
[35:02.110 --> 35:05.630]  It just looks like both videos went up without any knowledge of each other.
[35:05.870 --> 35:08.290]  Like one's called eating the plumber's pizza. The other one could have been
[35:08.290 --> 35:09.670]  making the plumber's pizza.
[35:09.670 --> 35:09.930]  Pizza day?
[35:11.030 --> 35:12.650]  But it's pizza day.
[35:15.050 --> 35:17.150]  That was the day we ate pizza.
[35:17.650 --> 35:20.950]  And it's two videos uploaded, what, minutes apart.
[35:21.110 --> 35:21.870]  30 minutes apart.
[35:23.650 --> 35:25.070]  30 minutes apart.
[35:25.750 --> 35:28.770]  We're terrible. We're terrible at video.
[35:29.210 --> 35:32.810]  While we're listening to Gavin complain, can I add on one little thing?
[35:33.290 --> 35:35.870]  What do you want your new job responsibility to be?
[35:35.870 --> 35:38.390]  I just don't, I just, well, never mind. I'm good.
[35:40.390 --> 35:44.570]  I gotta say, I gotta say it. The Bathroom Waffles video came out today.
[35:46.010 --> 35:51.030]  If you don't know, it's regulation animation. I was gonna do a whole spiel about them today,
[35:51.370 --> 35:55.150]  and how people should watch them. But then I was listening to the most recent release,
[35:55.270 --> 35:57.910]  and I just picked a random spot to pop into, and it was me talking,
[35:58.410 --> 36:01.630]  trying to send these up and trying to get people to watch them. So I guess I've already done that,
[36:01.670 --> 36:05.430]  so I'm not gonna beat you guys to death with it. But the Bathroom Waffles regulation animation
[36:05.430 --> 36:10.730]  came out today, which is, if you want to know where the genesis of waffles in f***face,
[36:10.790 --> 36:17.670]  it's there. So I would highly recommend watching it. It just seemed to cut off in the middle of
[36:17.670 --> 36:22.510]  the episode at the end, and just get like a hard cut into an outro for, I don't know,
[36:22.530 --> 36:26.550]  some RT shit, which is fine. But I just didn't know if it was supposed to cut off that hard,
[36:26.650 --> 36:31.890]  or if that was an oopsie. No, does it do that? It did when I watched it. Does anyone
[36:33.250 --> 36:37.870]  watch the final export? That's a great question. Something a YouTube strategist probably would do.
[36:38.870 --> 36:43.170]  It does. It just cuts off. It just cuts off a little abruptly, right? I just thought that
[36:43.170 --> 36:47.550]  was odd. And I was gonna bring it up to you, but then after Gavin started, I don't know if I can
[36:47.550 --> 36:53.510]  pop it. I think that's just the end of the bit. Just the end? Okay. It just hard cuts too hard.
[36:53.670 --> 36:59.910]  Okay. But now instead of Eric talking at the end of the episode and not being bleeped, we now have
[36:59.910 --> 37:09.930]  other people who aren't on bleeped. Yep. It's pretty cool, right? Do you love it? Do you love
[37:09.930 --> 37:21.110]  it? Pretty cool. For every good thing we could do on this show, there are just so many things
[37:21.600 --> 37:28.490]  to drag it back down into the mud. Regardless of how much we put into it. How about this? I
[37:28.490 --> 37:32.630]  approve all the audio, right? I always do that every week. Give me the video too. I'll do it.
[37:32.670 --> 37:36.430]  You got it. I'll have them send you the video. I'm totally fine with that.
[37:37.150 --> 37:39.910]  I'm fine. I'm happy to do it. Okay. Okay. I'll let them know.
[37:40.350 --> 37:43.210]  So I just want our content to feel like we made it.
[37:43.450 --> 37:46.070]  Oh, Gavin, I completely understand. I think it kind of does. I think that's
[37:46.070 --> 37:49.570]  part of the problem. Maybe a little too much.
[37:51.310 --> 37:54.050]  Maybe it feels like somebody at one level above us made it.
[37:54.930 --> 37:58.130]  Maybe that's what we should be shooting for. So anyone else in the company?
[37:58.650 --> 38:03.290]  So I'm checking my notes for stuff I want to talk about today. And I don't have a ton.
[38:03.390 --> 38:07.730]  I have a little bit, but I have a note I don't understand. And I was wondering if this will
[38:07.730 --> 38:14.670]  trigger something to you guys. And maybe Andrew specifically. I have a section about asparagus
[38:14.670 --> 38:20.630]  and pea and stuff. I had some, by the way, I ate a shitload of asparagus last night to get an update.
[38:22.390 --> 38:29.130]  Um, and in my notes, like I have, I have any pea updates, pea saga, ate a bunch of normal asparagus
[38:29.130 --> 38:33.010]  last night and no smell at all. These are my notes. And then I have an idea about us trying
[38:33.010 --> 38:37.670]  to create the worst smelling pea ever. And then I have a note that just says, just had a whole
[38:37.670 --> 38:43.910]  bucket of asparagus, Andrew said. What does that mean? Oh, Andrew had asparagus? No. Did you have
[38:43.910 --> 38:50.210]  a bucket of asparagus? No, I haven't eaten asparagus since we've last recorded. I don't
[38:50.210 --> 38:54.050]  know what that note means. I don't know what I was trying to convey there. It just, just had a
[38:54.050 --> 39:00.330]  whole bucket of asparagus dash Andrew said here. I'm going to take a screenshot of it. It's so
[39:00.330 --> 39:05.450]  fucking weird. I feel like this has to be two separate things that you've accidentally linked
[39:05.450 --> 39:13.550]  together. Maybe? Because I haven't held a bucket in the time between. Nevermind. I know. I don't
[39:13.550 --> 39:17.730]  know if it was like something like I'm referencing something from an episode that I don't remember
[39:17.730 --> 39:23.110]  that you guys do or something or just like I just don't you've seen your knowledge. No buckets,
[39:23.290 --> 39:29.790]  no asparagus. No buckets, no asparagus. That makes it even more confusing for me. Yeah. Andrew said.
[39:30.130 --> 39:33.990]  Here it is. Here's my note. I put it up in Slack. Thank God it was powerful enough.
[39:34.730 --> 39:37.470]  NEP update. What if Andrew? Yeah.
[39:41.290 --> 39:45.810]  I was looking at my notes today. Oh, I can go through them. Inflatable. The first note is
[39:45.810 --> 39:51.290]  inflatable. I think I everybody in Austin has a fucking I assume all over the world has Christmas
[39:51.290 --> 39:56.110]  inflatables, you know, like Snowmen and Santa Claus. And there's a bunch of like Elf and Clark
[39:56.110 --> 40:00.830]  Griswold and stuff. And I was thinking it'd be funny to have like a face inflatable, like if it
[40:00.830 --> 40:05.430]  was Ian or I don't know something else, because apparently they're easy to make because they're
[40:05.430 --> 40:09.270]  licensed out the fucking asshole. Everybody, everybody in my neighborhood has some sort of
[40:09.270 --> 40:13.310]  property on their front lawn inflated. And I was thinking maybe next year we should try to have
[40:13.310 --> 40:18.930]  some sort of fuck face Christmas inflatable. Then I wrote underwater hand hockey because I watched
[40:18.930 --> 40:24.030]  that Chris Hemsworth show where he like trying to live longer or whatever. And there was an episode
[40:24.030 --> 40:29.530]  where he was trying to hold his breath better. And he played a game of hockey underwater against
[40:29.530 --> 40:33.250]  another team. And they had hockey sticks and a puck, but it was all played on the bottom of the
[40:33.250 --> 40:37.910]  pool. And I thought that was kind of cool and that we should consider that. I thought we should
[40:37.910 --> 40:44.250]  consider that for our alternative sports podcast. What if hockey didn't have it? Yeah, it's like
[40:44.250 --> 40:48.210]  hockey didn't have enough barriers of entry already. Like let's make this more accessible.
[40:49.070 --> 40:52.830]  Everybody underwater. We're all going to be underwater and play this sport. And you got to
[40:52.830 --> 40:56.750]  hold it. Yeah, it's episode. If you want to see it in action, it's episode three. But apparently it's
[40:56.750 --> 40:59.650]  like a whole sport. So I kind of wanted to look into it. I wanted to see if you guys have ever
[40:59.650 --> 41:04.490]  heard of underwater hand hockey before. No. And by the way, I'm calling it underwater hand hockey
[41:04.490 --> 41:08.450]  because that's what it looks like to me. I don't know if it's got a better name, but it's a bunch
[41:08.450 --> 41:15.010]  of dudes, a full hockey team underwater in Speedos holding their breath, slamming a puck on
[41:15.010 --> 41:20.250]  the bottom of a pool. I was against this at first. I guess. I don't know. That wasn't the point of the episode.
[41:20.350 --> 41:25.170]  The point of the episode was he was trying to fast and catch his food. So he's having to learn how
[41:25.170 --> 41:29.070]  to hold his breath longer so he could spear fish or some shit. I don't know. I'm now on board
[41:29.470 --> 41:33.710]  after thinking about this. This is the premise of like that the penalty box is you just have to be on
[41:33.710 --> 41:39.010]  the surface. You just have to like be not underwater. It's great. I want to see underwater fights.
[41:39.290 --> 41:46.270]  You have to dog paddle for three minutes before you can get out. Then I just had a whole bucket
[41:46.270 --> 41:51.330]  of asparagus, Dash Andrew said. And I just don't know what that is. Then any pee updates? I was just
[41:51.330 --> 41:54.890]  wondering if anybody ate any asparagus. And if you did, did you get any updates or smelled any
[41:54.890 --> 42:03.050]  particularly strong coffee? Has anybody noticed any pee smells lately? No. I'm just still
[42:03.050 --> 42:08.010]  processing. I don't think asparagus is an appetizing food. It's so good.
[42:09.210 --> 42:12.910]  Yeah, it's good to enjoy it, but I don't think it's like a food that people would get super
[42:12.910 --> 42:17.570]  excited about. I don't think it's appealing in that way. Yeah, like it's not like
[42:17.970 --> 42:22.410]  anyone's like, wow, I'm so excited for this asparagus. This is going to be like the star
[42:22.410 --> 42:28.010]  of the dish. It's not an appetizing food in that sense. And serving it in a bucket has to be the
[42:28.010 --> 42:32.490]  least appealing mechanism. I don't know. There's something disgusting about it. I don't understand.
[42:33.470 --> 42:37.330]  Bucket of asparagus. Where that came from. Like that, I wrote that. I just don't know what it means.
[42:38.250 --> 42:43.830]  Or what I'm referencing. That'd be psychotic. Like a KFC bucket of asparagus? Yeah, right?
[42:44.970 --> 42:49.950]  I will say I ate, Emily made asparagus last night and she put it in the air fryer and she
[42:49.950 --> 42:56.690]  melted some parmesan cheese on it. Holy fucking shit was that good. I ate so much of it because
[42:56.690 --> 43:01.930]  I wanted to see if I could blast my fucking pee smell out. And I had nothing. Nothing. Just like
[43:01.930 --> 43:08.210]  the most bog standard piss smell ever. But it furthered, no it wasn't the cheese, it furthered,
[43:09.030 --> 43:14.930]  it was furthering the experiment. I, last time I had the bad smell from organic asparagus, right?
[43:15.130 --> 43:20.170]  This is just like bog standard asparagus. So I am thinking, I'm thinking there is something to
[43:20.170 --> 43:26.470]  asparagus versus like traditional store, like traditionally available. So I'm going to go
[43:26.470 --> 43:31.450]  back to try to find some organic now and do it again and see if I can blast out the smell. And
[43:31.450 --> 43:38.250]  if I can, that gets me to my next point on this list which is, can we create the worst smelling
[43:38.250 --> 43:45.290]  piss ever? If you like fully ingest like a ton of super strong coffee and a ton of organic asparagus
[43:45.290 --> 43:49.290]  and other stuff that's supposed to make your pee smell, I know we looked some stuff up, and you
[43:49.290 --> 43:54.690]  just try to like ingest only that stuff and then hold your pee for as long as you can, can you
[43:54.690 --> 43:59.830]  unleash like the stinkiest piss on earth? What would we have to do, have a judge that's smelling
[43:59.830 --> 44:04.510]  three cups of piss? Who are we going to be able to get to do this? I think you can, I think you
[44:04.510 --> 44:08.550]  can self-judge. I think you can tell like, oh my god, this is the worst smelling pee I've ever had.
[44:08.750 --> 44:13.470]  And then if so, if so, we should take it on the road and we should go to like the Alamo Draft House
[44:13.470 --> 44:17.310]  or go to like some place where people pee a lot and then piss in a place and see if anybody's
[44:17.310 --> 44:21.930]  like, oh my god, like let's see, like that's the ultimate. If you can make a pee smell so bad
[44:21.930 --> 44:27.530]  in public that a stranger comments on it. I don't think a stranger would ever comment on a piss,
[44:27.650 --> 44:31.390]  you know. I think they might. I certainly wouldn't. I think if it's hideous enough,
[44:31.450 --> 44:36.950]  I think they would. No. I mean they're in a, yeah, I'd like, I mean, I'd like to get there,
[44:37.090 --> 44:42.470]  I'd like to try it, I'd like to smell, I'd like to curate a urine smell so strong
[44:43.250 --> 44:48.870]  of coffee and asparagus and other things we don't even know yet, I don't know, that it's like,
[44:48.870 --> 44:53.730]  it's unavoidable. Like people can't walk in, they're like, oh my god, I can't handle this.
[44:54.010 --> 44:56.770]  Like it was making my eyes water the other day when I had that asparagus pee.
[44:57.410 --> 45:02.270]  I would assume that the, it wouldn't combine. I think just one of the things would overpower
[45:02.270 --> 45:06.950]  the other. I don't think I have a sophisticated enough nose to distinguish what percentage was
[45:06.950 --> 45:12.630]  coffee as opposed to asparagus. I think it's just gonna add, I think it's just gonna add to the
[45:12.630 --> 45:18.210]  smell. Like if you took a stinky dead dog and you threw it on a pile of garbage, you wouldn't be
[45:18.210 --> 45:22.370]  able to tell the difference between the two stinks. It would just create a greater stink.
[45:24.210 --> 45:28.690]  I thought I had worst example locked up with firing a gun off of a building,
[45:28.830 --> 45:34.850]  but you just threw a dead dog randomly. You ever smell a dead dog, dude? No, no I haven't. Oh god,
[45:34.930 --> 45:41.010]  I grew up in Alabama. There are dead dogs everywhere. They were...
[45:43.890 --> 45:48.890]  Why? There are so many dead dogs in Alabama. Just on the side of the road and shit, people hit them
[45:48.890 --> 45:54.770]  and then they just like, and they like, in the summer, they would get bloated like with gases
[45:54.770 --> 45:58.810]  and stuff, and then like kids in my school would throw rocks at them and try to pop them, and then
[45:58.810 --> 46:02.990]  like a dog would explode with like maggots and stuff, and it's a hideous fucking smell. It's a
[46:02.990 --> 46:08.830]  hideous smell. There are like big windows of your life that whatever you start telling a story from,
[46:08.830 --> 46:16.290]  I like, brace myself. You guys have never seen a dead, a bloated dead dog on the side of the road,
[46:16.510 --> 46:20.010]  and a couple of kids from your school chucked rocks at it till they hit it to make it pop?
[46:20.730 --> 46:25.790]  No. I never went on a dog popping spree. Well, I didn't say I'd ever done it,
[46:25.830 --> 46:30.450]  I just said I've seen it done. Oh my god. You just watched it? I've never kicked a duck,
[46:30.530 --> 46:36.610]  but I saw a kid do it at the fucking, at the uh, I saw a kid do it at the bus stop one time, like...
[46:36.610 --> 46:41.970]  People in Alabama hate animals. Why was a duck waiting for a bus? Well, that was in Florida.
[46:42.510 --> 46:47.890]  The duck had business to attend to. Now, I lived like, uh, next to a bunch of ponds and shit,
[46:47.950 --> 46:48.890]  and so there were all these ducks around.
[46:53.550 --> 46:56.070]  Eric wrote FTK. Florida Duck.
[46:57.430 --> 47:01.310]  That's what I, that's, it was at that bus stop that I saw my first duck dick.
[47:03.990 --> 47:08.390]  You guys ever seen a duck's dick? No, no I haven't, Geoff. You should look it up.
[47:08.970 --> 47:13.810]  No, I'm good. You should look up a duck's dick. Oh, is that the corkscrew one? Yeah,
[47:13.950 --> 47:19.410]  it looks like a, it looks like a corkscrew. Oh, I've heard of that. Oh, it's a razor one?
[47:19.550 --> 47:21.910]  It's like fucking, it's like, they're horrible. There you go.
[47:23.290 --> 47:28.570]  I'm not gonna google that. No, I'm good. Yeah, don't worry about it. Uh, no need to.
[47:28.650 --> 47:33.830]  When you said, there you go, I have legitimate fear you're about to drop a photo in the discord.
[47:34.070 --> 47:38.510]  Oh yeah, I found one. Do you think you could pop a dog with a duck dick?
[47:39.150 --> 47:46.330]  I, I, like, if you could use it as like a, as a whip maybe. They're like long corkscrews.
[47:46.590 --> 47:56.130]  They're really weird. Anyway, are, are you okay? I know. Are you? Geoff, are you all right? What?
[47:58.030 --> 48:01.770]  What? What do you mean am I all right? Of course I'm fine. I had to change the title for this
[48:01.770 --> 48:09.210]  episode for, to beat Geoff's dead dogs and duck dicks. Like, what's going on? What happened here?
[48:09.530 --> 48:15.890]  Stop! That's a duck. That's what a duck's dick looks like. What? They're fucking weird. It looks
[48:15.890 --> 48:24.250]  like, oh, I hate it. It's like the worst fused discord emission possible. Stop posting duck dicks.
[48:26.290 --> 48:31.630]  That's why you don't, that's why, that's why I remember what a duck's dick looks
[48:31.630 --> 48:38.750]  like because I saw one at the bus stop. Why was it? Because it was banging another duck.
[48:39.930 --> 48:45.110]  This show better win an award. We can't win an award.
[48:47.190 --> 48:49.510]  Yeah, what's Jack gonna say about the preview?
[48:51.630 --> 48:56.530]  Anyway, anyway, I think we should try to make the worst smelling piss.
[48:57.730 --> 49:00.710]  Oh, okay. Yeah, I think it would be funny.
[49:04.510 --> 49:09.910]  Next note, what if Andrew said it was one of us? That got me thinking. We still don't know who the
[49:09.910 --> 49:14.150]  mole is, who was, who the pickle mole is, who was going around Austin taking pictures of the pickle
[49:14.150 --> 49:19.430]  because Andrew hasn't told us yet. He had a prime, you had a prime moment. Because I don't, at no
[49:19.430 --> 49:24.750]  point did I consider that it was Nick, Eric, or Gavin, really. But you could have, you could have
[49:25.590 --> 49:29.290]  you could have totally created so much paranoia in that moment if you would have just said,
[49:29.370 --> 49:33.690]  I'm not going to tell you who it is, but they're on the discord right now, and if they want to
[49:33.690 --> 49:38.850]  come forward, they can. And we would have eaten each other apart. Well, I don't want to, we talked
[49:38.850 --> 49:43.870]  about this. I'm honestly surprised they haven't talked to you already about it. No. We also talked
[49:43.870 --> 49:48.990]  about the fact that Andrew didn't for a second think that we wouldn't believe that he was in
[49:49.690 --> 49:56.150]  Yeah, so is that on top of the fact that now that, you know, I've said I wasn't, I'm not going
[49:56.150 --> 49:59.890]  to just reveal the person unless they're okay with it. What about if you reveal the person,
[49:59.990 --> 50:07.590]  I'll reveal the name of that number? What number? 67 or whatever. Yeah, no, the fact that I didn't
[50:07.590 --> 50:11.610]  remember what you're talking about at all, I don't care. It's fine. You pretend not to care,
[50:11.670 --> 50:16.630]  but you do care. Yeah, I forgot though. So I'll probably forget again. Doesn't matter. I will
[50:16.630 --> 50:21.210]  care for the next two days. No, I can't. Well, it's weird because they said they were going to
[50:21.210 --> 50:29.450]  tell and then they didn't. So they haven't responded to me. Also, I wrote down I want
[50:29.450 --> 50:34.550]  the bussy bus. It got me thinking. I was thinking about the tuxedo that we have and how we had that
[50:34.550 --> 50:38.930]  whole idea to do Ripken's Believe It Cause Why Not Traveling Museum and we're going to do it
[50:38.930 --> 50:46.530]  for the live show that fell through. Wouldn't it be awesome if that bus still existed and
[50:46.530 --> 50:56.230]  we could buy that bus and then convert it into a mobile museum? Like the bus, like if like is
[50:56.230 --> 51:03.770]  is it how do we how do we find out if the bussy bus is still on this earth? We could figure that
[51:03.770 --> 51:08.890]  out. I see. Even if it's just a shell, we could put an engine in it and get it roadworthy again.
[51:08.990 --> 51:16.290]  We could restore it and turn it into the mobile face museum with which we have all of our oddities.
[51:16.850 --> 51:21.730]  Because I've never been to a museum where the building itself is one of the exhibits. Exactly.
[51:22.750 --> 51:28.190]  That's a great point. Exactly. I don't know. I don't know how to do it. Andrew, I'm going to
[51:28.190 --> 51:33.470]  have to rely on your expertise knowing more about bussy than we do. Can you do some research to see
[51:33.470 --> 51:38.930]  if we can figure out who to talk to? I'll look into it. To find out. I'm sure they're not still
[51:38.930 --> 51:42.990]  using it. Although if they were, that'd be even better. We could just buy. I would pay out of
[51:42.990 --> 51:48.810]  pocket for that bus no matter what. My fear is we're going to learn that that's the bus that was
[51:48.810 --> 51:54.470]  into the wild. That bus is just in Alaska in the middle of the wilderness. We're going to find
[51:54.470 --> 52:00.970]  it, but it's going to be impossible to retrieve. That actually would be easy because they had to
[52:00.970 --> 52:04.630]  actually go and remove that bus because people kept dying out there. Yeah, it's gone now. Oh,
[52:04.630 --> 52:08.190]  it's terrible. Yeah, dumbasses kept going out there and getting trapped and having to get
[52:08.190 --> 52:12.970]  rescued or dying. And so they finally had to go helicopter the bus out. What a complete
[52:12.970 --> 52:18.970]  misunderstanding of that story. I feel like if that story conveys anything, it's don't do this.
[52:19.170 --> 52:24.910]  Yeah, don't go to the bus. Yeah. What's like that bit of old crane and at Chernobyl, like the
[52:24.910 --> 52:29.530]  deadliest item on the planet and people still go and try and find it. They had to like chuck it in
[52:29.530 --> 52:35.590]  the woods. Yeah. Wait, what? It was like a crane arm that they were using to like pick up all the
[52:35.590 --> 52:41.070]  radioactive graphite and stuff from Chernobyl, I think. But it became basically the most
[52:41.070 --> 52:50.810]  radioactive item on the planet. And people just want to go and see it. I don't, I mean,
[52:50.810 --> 52:57.130]  there's so many layers to that. I don't, there's such an odd. Why? Speaking of dying, while we're
[52:57.130 --> 53:01.610]  talking about underwater hand hockey, I just Googled water polo. And the first thing that
[53:01.610 --> 53:08.850]  came up was fatality rate. And under it, it says water polo was the only female sport to rank among
[53:08.850 --> 53:17.210]  the deadliest sports with a 42, oh, 0.42 fatality rate per hundred thousand participants. Oh,
[53:17.290 --> 53:25.110]  okay. Is that really, is that high? 0.42 or is that 42? I think 42 per a hundred thousand would be
[53:25.110 --> 53:31.170]  completely deadly. Yeah. Yeah. That's the crane. Yeah. World's most deadly crane.
[53:32.290 --> 53:36.410]  I don't want to go and see that. I want nothing to do with that. I'm happy to look at the photo.
[53:37.670 --> 53:42.370]  That could be next door. I'm not going to go see it. I don't need to see that. If it was next door,
[53:42.490 --> 53:45.350]  you probably would want to move away from it. Those dudes are fucking dead, right?
[53:46.550 --> 53:49.290]  Oh, they must be. The guy checking his fucking phone, standing next to it.
[53:52.730 --> 54:01.310]  Jesus. Um, police sports, water polo. So it's 42 or 4.2? I can't tell because it's in like the
[54:01.310 --> 54:06.070]  weird Google. Can you not tell because it's on your clock is how it's displayed? The number?
[54:06.270 --> 54:13.430]  Oh, it says 0.42. It says 0.42. Yeah. That doesn't seem, that's like one in almost 200,000
[54:14.570 --> 54:18.450]  people. Yeah, I guess. I mean, I don't, when I think of like people dying in sports,
[54:18.550 --> 54:22.690]  it's not super common across mainstream sports. I guess that's true. I don't think I've ever
[54:22.690 --> 54:26.870]  heard of anyone dying in baseball. I mean, boxing is what comes to mind. People dying.
[54:26.870 --> 54:35.310]  Football? Rugby? Has anyone died playing baseball? I mean, I feel like statistically... Oh shit!
[54:38.290 --> 54:47.870]  Ray Chapman was hit in the head by a pitch... oh fuck, where'd it go? Death. On August 16th,
[54:47.870 --> 54:52.070]  1920, Ray Chapman was struck in the head and killed by a pitch thrown by Carl Mays
[54:52.070 --> 54:56.350]  during a game against the New York Yankees. At the time, pitchers commonly dirtied balls
[54:56.350 --> 55:03.510]  with soil, licorice, and tobacco juice and scuffed, sandpapered, scarred, cut, or spiked
[55:03.510 --> 55:07.450]  them, giving a misshapen, earth-colored ball that traveled through the air erratically,
[55:07.770 --> 55:11.490]  tended to soften in the later innings, and as it came to the play, it was very hard to see.
[55:12.150 --> 55:16.010]  He threw a submarine delivery, and it was late in the afternoon. Eyewitnesses recounted that
[55:16.010 --> 55:19.630]  Chapman did not react to the pitch at all, presumably unable to see it. The sound of
[55:19.630 --> 55:25.450]  the ball striking his skull was so loud, he thought it had hit the end of the bat.
[55:25.890 --> 55:28.490]  And he fielded the ball and threw it to first base.
[55:30.290 --> 55:35.370]  Home plate umpire Tommy Connolly, noticing that Chapman was bleeding from his left ear,
[55:35.930 --> 55:39.990]  screamed toward the stands for a doctor. Trish Speaker, who'd been on deck,
[55:40.070 --> 55:45.510]  rushed to Chapman, as did several players from each team. He tried to walk, but his knees buckled.
[55:45.630 --> 55:47.870]  As he was helped off the field by his teammates, he mumbled,
[55:47.870 --> 55:54.350]  I'm all right. Tell him not to worry. Ring. Katie's ring. He said, I'm all right. Tell
[55:54.350 --> 55:59.330]  Maze not to worry. Dot dot dot. Ring. Dot dot dot. Katie's ring. Before falling unconscious,
[55:59.530 --> 56:03.210]  he was taken to a hospital, uh, where he died at 440 in the morning from brain damage.
[56:03.730 --> 56:11.250]  His pregnant wife! Oh my god, he had a pregnant wife. That must be Katie. Yeah. Oh, that's so sad.
[56:12.110 --> 56:17.470]  That's terrible. That's tragic. Can I... not to make light of the situation. But you're about to.
[56:17.870 --> 56:22.810]  No, no, I'm just curious. I mean, I assume they called the game. He can't continue playing after
[56:22.810 --> 56:29.230]  that. Well, if he died later, they might have just. Well, OK, so let's say he didn't. Do they
[56:29.230 --> 56:34.490]  just put somebody on first? Because that wasn't an out. Like throwing the first, like, because you
[56:34.490 --> 56:42.510]  hit, you get given the base, right? It doesn't say. Like, what's the rule for that? I don't know.
[56:42.730 --> 56:45.930]  That's like somebody died. And I just know there's somebody in the stands that's like,
[56:45.930 --> 56:50.430]  this is fucking bullshit. We should have a guy on first right now. The well, they don't be moved.
[56:50.710 --> 56:53.950]  I mean, they didn't know he was dying, right? Like they just took him off the field to the
[56:53.950 --> 56:57.130]  hospital. So they probably. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It might have just been like an injury
[56:57.130 --> 57:03.030]  and then. Well, treat it like an injury. I mean. I feel like a guy passing out with blood coming
[57:03.030 --> 57:07.930]  out of his ear is pretty alarming, regardless of. Sure. I think the assumption wouldn't be
[57:07.930 --> 57:12.730]  that things are going to be great. They don't stop playing when some kid gets hit by a foul
[57:12.730 --> 57:16.450]  ball and baseball and gets his head split open. They got to carry him out. You know,
[57:16.510 --> 57:21.230]  like the game continues and that happens. That's different, though, because they're not an active
[57:21.230 --> 57:31.570]  player. Yeah, a Padres pitcher got hit in the face by an Albert Pujols line drive. It like
[57:31.570 --> 57:37.270]  hit him in the head in like the game stopped and everyone like gathered around and prayed
[57:37.270 --> 57:43.410]  because it was bad, bad. They took him out of the game. The game continued, which is, I mean,
[57:43.410 --> 57:46.730]  I guess what you're asking. They just you know, you put another pitcher in and the game continues
[57:46.730 --> 57:53.630]  from 2008, I think. But that guy who got hit in the face is now the general manager of the Rangers.
[57:53.970 --> 57:58.550]  And that's so I guess you can just kind of keep being in baseball as long as you don't die from
[57:58.550 --> 58:05.630]  getting hit. Well, and you take you take special precautions to maybe like didn't John Olerud wear
[58:05.630 --> 58:11.950]  a helmet when he bat with like when he fielded. Because he had some sort of a brain issue,
[58:12.090 --> 58:16.370]  and so he wore he wore like a batter's helmet anytime he played baseball, even if he was like,
[58:16.910 --> 58:21.590]  I don't know. I don't know what position John Olerud played. Third base. There have you guys
[58:21.590 --> 58:29.050]  seen? First base, he was first base. Alex Torres was a pitcher for the Padres. I think he worked
[58:29.050 --> 58:36.570]  for the Mets also. Oh, no. This is real. Well, okay. Is that a helmet? It's a hat.
[58:36.730 --> 58:43.810]  Helmet hat? It's a hat that is supposed if you get if a ball comes back at you, it's gonna hit.
[58:46.350 --> 58:51.110]  You know, in a video game when you like pick up an item and it shrinks down.
[58:53.030 --> 59:02.970]  It's like Mario halfway through. I know it. I know it looks photoshopped. It's not. That was
[59:02.970 --> 59:10.950]  what he wore as a pitcher. He wore a protective hat. I like it. That I think is actually I think
[59:10.950 --> 59:15.450]  that's great. Yeah, I'm a big fan of this. I'm not making fun of that. That's genius. Not at all.
[59:16.750 --> 59:23.450]  It's stylish. You can just wear that around. I'm sorry. It's stylish. That's you can't tell me that
[59:23.450 --> 59:29.070]  that ain't style. I'm not saying it's great style, but that's a definite style. It just looks like
[59:29.070 --> 59:34.270]  every picture of him is his hat is closer to the camera than he is. See, I'm personally excited
[59:34.270 --> 59:38.430]  about this because it looks like a hat I could actually wear, which is very rare. This is an
[59:38.430 --> 59:44.010]  exciting thing for me. Have we found you a hat yet, Andrew? No, but next we should wrap this up
[59:44.010 --> 59:48.930]  after talking about dead dogs and people getting murdered. Everyone's favorite comedy podcast.
[59:50.150 --> 59:56.450]  I have a photo to show Gavin of my big head dilemma. Okay, I can't wait. Should we wrap this
[59:56.450 --> 01:00:01.190]  up? Yeah. I mean, if you guys want to let it go for about five more minutes, that'd be fine. I
[01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:05.130]  gotta I gotta I gotta stop down between recordings to go get Millie from school.
[01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:09.550]  So I'm trying. But why would us continuing five more minutes? Yeah, it doesn't make that at all.
[01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:15.110]  Because we give we give the audience more content and then it'll be time at that point for me to go
[01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:19.190]  get her. And otherwise, I got five minutes to kill before I need to leave to go get her. I'd
[01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:24.130]  rather spend it. I was going to use this between time to eat lunch. Don't do it. That's another
[01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:28.030]  thing, too. It would diminish it would diminish the between time. So Gavin can't eat. No, you
[01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:31.590]  know what? Maybe Gavin's going to get a bunch of asparagus. This could be important research.
[01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:36.790]  Nobody. None of you are going to eat asparagus. It's just I love asparagus. Nobody else. I'll do
[01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:40.450]  the asparagus challenge. Yeah, I'm not at all opposed to this. I think we're also going to chug
[01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:45.050]  soda from a Gerpler this episode. Oh, yeah, we talked about that, too. I also didn't have your
[01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:52.050]  Gerpler. I also. Well, that's a big surprise there. I also I have the apple. I think we'll
[01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:57.550]  bring that out next episode. It's been over. It's time. It's been a year. The Cosmic Crisp Apple
[01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:03.670]  will come out. Still don't have a new fridge, which is great. It looks real gross. So I
[01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:09.190]  definitely don't think I had the fridge for that apple. No, I might try again. Also,
[01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:16.790]  we'll cover it next episode. Oh, we should wrap this one up. Geoff is successfully just filling
[01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:20.730]  time. And look at him. Look at the way he works. I don't think this is successful in filling. Do
[01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:26.630]  you guys think how? Let me let me ask you a question. How long do you guys think you could
[01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:32.570]  eat the same thing and only that thing every day before you get what you've had to eat something
[01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:38.250]  else? Now, a couple weeks. Jean, like, what about foods that you can rotate the topics on,
[01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:42.850]  like pizza? No, I mean, I mean, it's like it's like, yeah, it's like the same thing.
[01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:48.490]  Like you go get a Red Baron pepperoni pizza and you only eat a Red Baron pepperoni pizza,
[01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:52.170]  or you eat cheese enchiladas from your favorite Mexican restaurant,
[01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:57.830]  or you eat Captain Crunch with milk. It's like the exact same item. I mean, I would
[01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:02.090]  definitely be fed up after a couple of weeks, but I mean, I feel like I could do it indefinitely.
[01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:09.190]  Like Andrew, he spent a month eating chicken dinners. I'm assuming there was some variety in
[01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:13.870]  how the chicken was prepared, but like if it was like McDonald's chicken McNuggets and you could
[01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:18.370]  only eat McDonald's chicken McNuggets, like how long do you think you could go before you had to
[01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:22.010]  quit? Like if we had a contest, we're not going to do this. I'm just curious. Yeah, nuggets,
[01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:27.510]  it would not be super long because there's such a range of being good or bad. Like it's temperature
[01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:31.630]  based for me when it comes to McDonald's chicken nuggets. I think I could have pepperoni pizza
[01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:38.110]  every day for like two months and not really think about it. But wouldn't you drop dead? No.
[01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:43.290]  No. I guess you might want to be strategic about what it is you're eating just for
[01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:52.830]  vitamin and nourishment input, but I guess I was thinking purely taste. I think I could do,
[01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:57.250]  I think I could eat the same thing every day for a year. Like if I only ate, I don't know,
[01:02:57.250 --> 01:03:02.450]  Big Macs from January 1st to December 31st of 2023, I think I could do that. I'm not going to
[01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:08.310]  do it, but I think I could do it. I think I could do a year. I'm not a fan of the Big Mac. I wouldn't
[01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:13.630]  be after long, but I am currently. I finally figured out how to not get a Big Mac. Because
[01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:18.670]  I feel like I always crave a Big Mac. If I see McDonald's, I'm like, ooh, could go for that.
[01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:24.570]  But now I'm successfully able to pull the memory of what it feels like to have just finished a
[01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:31.110]  Big Mac and how shitty and like rank it feels. And I just remember that now before I eat one,
[01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:35.790]  and I don't want to eat anymore. I think a Big Mac is the worst burger at McDonald's. Oh,
[01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:42.190]  you're crazy. It's fine. I think that I'm over secret sauce. Like it's whatever, but it doesn't
[01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:46.750]  appeal to me anymore. I've replaced the Big Mac with just two cheeseburgers, just two bog standard
[01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:52.050]  McDonald's cheeseburgers. And that's, it's the, I enjoy that more. I feel like sucking down the first
[01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:57.670]  third of a Big Mac is one of the best things you can eat. Nah. Yeah. I think a quarter pounder is
[01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:03.530]  way better. We fell for Geoff's trap. Well, there you have it. I mean, he fit. God damn it, Geoff.
[01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:08.110]  You've listened to another episode of the F*** Face podcast. Thanks for hanging in there with us.
[01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:11.710]  Sorry things got a little bit weird, but you know how Andrew gets with his duck dicks and his
[01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:17.290]  exploding dogs and stuff. So hopefully you'll tune in next week when we do this all again. I hear
[01:04:17.290 --> 01:04:22.790]  that Geoff might eat an apple that's a year and five days old. There's no way you're eating that.
[01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:29.050]  There's a syrup. What are you talking about? What? I'm supposed to eat it, aren't I? No, I don't.
[01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:37.410]  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. See you guys next time. Next week. Yep. Bye. My headphones
[01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:44.490]  cut out. I don't know what just happened. I'll tell you what happened. I f***ing won. I got that.
[01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:49.110]  Hey, guys. Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:55.250]  Andrew had the biggest baby skull. Geoff tries the Cosmic Crisp. Don't mix up Liam Neeson and
[01:04:55.250 --> 01:05:01.810]  Leslie Nielsen. Mmm, Moon Pie. Let's get paranoid in 2023. And once again, Andrew
[01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:06.150]  does not eat the pencil. All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
