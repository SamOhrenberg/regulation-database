[00:15.440 --> 00:19.680]  Oh, Raspberry Dream. That sounds pretty good, actually.
[00:20.240 --> 00:21.860]  Bloody Wild.
[00:23.360 --> 00:24.820]  Spring Fling.
[00:25.400 --> 00:28.080]  It's the ones when you start getting down into like,
[00:28.540 --> 00:33.580]  yeah, we've mixed Texas Tab, Dr. Pepper Vanilla, and Coconut Cream.
[00:34.220 --> 00:40.400]  Yeah, I will say though, the Endless Summer, Mountain Dew, Pomegranate, Grapefruit, and Fresh Lime
[00:40.400 --> 00:41.640]  sounds fucking good.
[00:41.640 --> 00:45.660]  It's just so much. That's like so much.
[00:46.040 --> 00:50.560]  I feel like any place is stretching when they give a section of their menu to cookies.
[00:51.060 --> 00:55.440]  When you just see a cookie section on a menu, that place doesn't have a lot.
[00:55.960 --> 00:58.420]  You don't know how Utah feels about cookies, man.
[01:00.060 --> 01:03.780]  I will say, I understand what you're saying, it's definitely weird,
[01:03.920 --> 01:06.920]  but as somebody who doesn't drink alcohol, who used to drink alcohol,
[01:06.920 --> 01:12.680]  anything you can do to spruce up a non-alcoholic drink makes my life easier.
[01:12.860 --> 01:19.000]  And also, I'm looking at these, none of these are more complicated than any fucking mixed drink.
[01:19.420 --> 01:24.560]  But it's not the complication that's getting me. I'm not concerned with the complication.
[01:25.140 --> 01:30.060]  It's that there are drinks on here that are mixing half and half with soda.
[01:30.380 --> 01:31.800]  Yeah, I don't like that.
[01:31.800 --> 01:35.680]  Dr. Pepper, Blackberry, Coconut, half and half. Gavin, would you drink that?
[01:35.680 --> 01:36.820]  What is the ingredients?
[01:37.180 --> 01:42.100]  It is Dr. Pepper, Blackberry flavoring, Coconut flavoring, and half and half.
[01:42.320 --> 01:46.360]  Oh, the half and half is a bit off-putting. I'd try it, but it sounds like just a sugary mess.
[01:46.520 --> 01:49.980]  Yeah, but I agree with you, but I wouldn't want half and half in anything,
[01:50.900 --> 01:54.120]  other than coffee or something that I'm cooking, you know what I mean?
[01:54.520 --> 01:56.480]  I don't like the Tehrani bottles.
[01:57.100 --> 01:58.120]  Who's drinking this?
[01:58.420 --> 02:02.280]  People in Utah. I don't like the bottles in the second photo, the Tehrani,
[02:02.280 --> 02:08.520]  To me, I feel like that guy is mixing something that would give me a skill point in Bioshock,
[02:08.620 --> 02:12.840]  just for how those bottles look. I don't know, there's something off-putting about it.
[02:13.120 --> 02:17.220]  Dude, I made a Moscow Mule on New Year's Eve that I couldn't breathe next to.
[02:17.680 --> 02:18.080]  Really?
[02:18.580 --> 02:18.840]  Yeah.
[02:19.300 --> 02:19.740]  Wow.
[02:20.360 --> 02:27.300]  That was crazy. It was... I don't know if you put too much ginger beer in it or what,
[02:27.400 --> 02:30.540]  but you couldn't drink it. It was awesome.
[02:30.540 --> 02:37.700]  It wrecked the air. If I went to take a sip and I was inhaling, it just made me cough for like 10 straight seconds.
[02:38.120 --> 02:41.580]  What a crazy way to learn that Gavin's a pro-Russia guy. I would have never guessed.
[02:43.940 --> 02:46.460]  Speaking of pro... well, I'm not going to start off like that.
[02:46.740 --> 02:50.160]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[02:50.800 --> 02:57.660]  This is episode 138. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Gavin Free, Andrew Panton.
[02:57.660 --> 03:03.840]  Can you guys name a song that has the word 138 in the title? Because one just jumped to my mind.
[03:04.600 --> 03:14.160]  138. No. I can think of 4-5 seconds. Is that 45 seconds or is it 4-5?
[03:14.500 --> 03:15.260]  21 seconds?
[03:15.660 --> 03:18.840]  No, the Paul McCartney, Kanye West...
[03:19.180 --> 03:24.180]  Oh, 4-5 seconds. I think that's what it's called. That's a great f***ing song, by the way.
[03:24.500 --> 03:25.680]  8-6-7-5.
[03:27.500 --> 03:30.880]  There's a Misfits song called We Are 138. That was really good.
[03:30.980 --> 03:33.280]  Oh! Well, that's exact.
[03:33.800 --> 03:36.640]  Yeah, that's why I saw 138. That's the first thing that popped into my mind.
[03:37.000 --> 03:44.720]  I used to have it on some live album, maybe Evil Eye, where they had Henry Rollins from Black Flag come on and sing it with them. It was a cool little live recording.
[03:45.060 --> 03:45.660]  That's impressive.
[03:46.680 --> 03:49.240]  Eric says there's a big one.
[03:49.980 --> 03:53.180]  Yeah, the big one is We Are 138, by the Misfits.
[03:53.180 --> 03:56.260]  I don't think that would be considered a big song in any sense.
[03:56.260 --> 04:01.680]  Yeah, I'm just thinking more along the lines of it hits 138 very specifically.
[04:02.200 --> 04:09.900]  It's also, the lyrics to that song are f***ing dumb. It's We Are 138, We Are 138, We're the Eye of the Tiger. Oh...
[04:09.900 --> 04:13.920]  I think that's it. We Are 138. Let me see.
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.560]  Here's the full, I'm gonna read the full lyrics to you.
[04:17.560 --> 04:24.300]  We are 138, we are 138, we are 138, we are 138, we are 138, we are 138, stick with me here.
[04:24.520 --> 04:30.040]  We are 138, we are 138, in the eyes of the tiger. Do you think we're robot clean?
[04:30.460 --> 04:35.220]  Does this face look almost mean it's time to be an android, not a man?
[04:35.600 --> 04:39.160]  The pleasantries are gone, we're stripped of all we were, in the eyes of the tiger.
[04:39.400 --> 04:44.880]  This is the best part. We are 138, we are 138, we are 138, we are 138, we are 138, we are 138.
[04:44.880 --> 05:09.200]  And then it ends with 88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888
[05:09.200 --> 05:14.100]  I have to guess it and that song came on and because of Gavin's lyrical change, all I hear
[05:14.100 --> 05:18.200]  is the bucket of AIDS thing and it ruins the whole song because I don't know where it's
[05:18.200 --> 05:23.180]  supposed to go. So I'm just constantly anticipating it and inserting it into every line.
[05:23.320 --> 05:28.020]  It's like the very first bit of the song. It's after he talks about Tommy. He's talking
[05:28.020 --> 05:31.760]  about the union. They've been on strike. Don't worry about it. And then he talks about Cheetah.
[05:32.160 --> 05:35.740]  Well, the problem is I was listening to it in a context that I didn't know where we were
[05:35.740 --> 05:39.460]  going into with the song. Like it just started playing. I didn't know what verse we're in
[05:39.460 --> 05:43.920]  if we're in the middle. It was a whole thing. I don't like songs that assume you're supposed
[05:43.920 --> 05:47.660]  to know who people are. Like, are we supposed to know who Tommy is? No, I don't think so.
[05:48.020 --> 05:53.520]  It's just a song about a dude. He's just telling a story. Yeah. I need a better intro. I know
[05:53.520 --> 05:56.500]  he used to work for the dogs. What do you want? Like, what more do you want to know
[05:56.500 --> 06:02.140]  about Tommy? Tommy was 17. He dropped out of high school. Listen to the fucking rest
[06:02.140 --> 06:08.180]  of the song. Go further than one fucking verse. I get very distracted by Gina drinking the barrel
[06:08.180 --> 06:12.800]  of AIDS, to be honest. I was thinking about that after we recorded that episode. Gavin,
[06:13.000 --> 06:17.140]  you used to sing, I don't know if you even know this, but you used to sing a song around Achievement
[06:17.140 --> 06:22.440]  Hunter way back in the day that I knew of the song. You know, you hear it in the background,
[06:22.640 --> 06:26.700]  but it was like a popular music song that just didn't cross my path. And so you would sing it
[06:26.700 --> 06:31.400]  wrong. And for a while, I thought that your lyrics were the real lyrics until I heard it on TV.
[06:31.400 --> 06:36.680]  But you used to sing, I throw my sandwich in the air sometime, singing, hey yo,
[06:36.860 --> 06:42.680]  where's the mayo? And I thought that was the song for maybe two weeks. Why? Why would you remember
[06:42.680 --> 06:53.600]  that? Because that's how I learned the song was from Gavin singing it. It's crazy to me that
[06:53.600 --> 07:00.800]  you missed that song. Where's the mayo? I mean, I had heard the song, but never listened to it.
[07:00.800 --> 07:04.200]  And then when Gavin was singing it around, I was like, oh, I guess that's the fucking song.
[07:04.300 --> 07:06.920]  And then like, I thought for like maybe two weeks, about the amount of time, you know,
[07:07.160 --> 07:10.020]  it's just one of those things where Gavin tricked me and didn't even realize he tricked me.
[07:10.840 --> 07:15.240]  I always wanted to do like, direct like a Hellman's commercial and have a party.
[07:16.940 --> 07:19.960]  Have you talked to the Hellman's company about it? No, you know what? I never did.
[07:20.940 --> 07:23.520]  I'll reach out for you. I'll let them know we got a really good pitch.
[07:24.120 --> 07:29.900]  Like, I think it would crush because there was a commercial that was all about Scoop,
[07:29.900 --> 07:35.320]  there it is, where they changed the lyrics from there it is to scoop. There it is for like ice
[07:35.320 --> 07:40.920]  cream or something. Yeah, it was like chocolate peanut butter cookie dough. You could do this.
[07:41.160 --> 07:45.660]  This is a good idea. It is a good idea. I don't know if it's an idea. It's an idea they would
[07:45.660 --> 07:51.540]  take. Speaking of speaking of reaching out, Andrew, do you make any progress on finding the
[07:51.540 --> 07:56.700]  bussy bus? Thank you so much for guiding it there. It's wow. It's almost like we organized this. I've
[07:56.700 --> 08:03.640]  in my notes things I've meant to update on that I haven't. First one is bus research,
[08:04.160 --> 08:09.640]  Seattle Breakers, now the Thunderbirds. So I tried to do some research. They have changed team names
[08:09.640 --> 08:15.400]  several times since this has happened. Also changed ownership several times. What's incredible
[08:15.400 --> 08:21.260]  is the guy that got traded for the bus has never, from what I could tell, he's never seen the bus
[08:21.260 --> 08:26.000]  because the next season when they were supposed to play against them, they got the bus confiscated
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.320]  at the border because they had somebody on their team that was from Europe illegally,
[08:30.560 --> 08:34.820]  like they didn't, I guess, have proper paperwork or whatever. So they confiscated the bus.
[08:35.220 --> 08:39.140]  And I guess he never just played against them again. So he hasn't even seen the bus. I reached
[08:39.140 --> 08:45.000]  out to the current team. I emailed their email all on their team website, which I believe is
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.740]  now the Seattle Thunderbirds. They did not get back to me. I've not got a reply. So we're still,
[08:49.880 --> 08:53.840]  we're digging. We're doing some research in that. The other things I can update on
[08:54.400 --> 08:59.040]  are jet ski covers or how many people in our audience owns jet skis, according to emails
[08:59.040 --> 09:03.540]  I have received. Do you guys have a guess for how many jet ski owners we have in the audience?
[09:04.620 --> 09:15.500]  Thirty five. Four. I said three. Eric's guess is fourteen. We apparently have 51.75 jet skis
[09:15.500 --> 09:21.060]  in our audience. No way. Dang. Wait, how's that a decimal? Somebody complained about like where
[09:21.060 --> 09:25.340]  they live, that it's like it's so shitty to use that it doesn't count as two full ones that
[09:25.340 --> 09:32.960]  they've got. 1.75. So we've got 51.75 jet skis, which is a lot more than three, which is what I
[09:32.960 --> 09:38.900]  anticipated. Yeah. And I guess the last update, not a not a happy one, but my hubby's bagel's
[09:38.900 --> 09:44.720]  closed. Just sad. Obviously, we talked about it on the show. We never got to go. No, I'm so
[09:44.720 --> 09:50.160]  disappointed. I was really excited for you guys to try the regulation bagel. So thank you to all
[09:50.160 --> 09:54.260]  the people that would like send me photos and stuff like they would travel from all over that
[09:54.260 --> 09:57.920]  list to the show and they check out the bagel shop. I just felt like I should bring it up on
[09:57.920 --> 10:01.620]  the show. So if people are planning on coming here for that specific reason, they are not
[10:01.620 --> 10:05.680]  disappointed. Even our whole podcast couldn't keep that place going. Yeah, I was about to say
[10:05.680 --> 10:10.300]  I can't help but feel like we failed them in some way. And I don't know why, because we probably did
[10:10.300 --> 10:15.420]  more to promote them than anybody else. Well, we stopped there, didn't we? We may have stopped,
[10:15.480 --> 10:20.140]  but the photos never stopped. It made me so happy. I'd constantly see photos and updates from people
[10:20.140 --> 10:23.780]  that went in, and I know it meant so much to them whenever anyone would come in and order it.
[10:24.020 --> 10:26.400]  So does that mean our bagel is looking for a new home?
[10:27.380 --> 10:31.580]  I guess so. I don't know. I feel like it may have died with them. I don't know. I'm in a grieving
[10:31.580 --> 10:37.240]  process. I'm not ready to think about a new bagel. That's a good point. Hey, if you own a bagel shop
[10:37.940 --> 10:41.840]  somewhere in America, or fuck, if you own a bagel shop anywhere in the world and you are a
[10:41.840 --> 10:48.480]  f***ing business owner, we have a regulation bagel that's currently without a team. We'd be willing
[10:48.480 --> 10:53.500]  to sign with your bagel company. Just drop an email to Andrew. And you could make it secret
[10:53.500 --> 10:58.120]  menu. You don't have to get stuff printed. We don't get stuff printed. We prefer secret menu.
[10:58.220 --> 11:03.540]  We're secret menu people. I'm just so blown away you remembered I threw my sandwich in the...
[11:03.540 --> 11:07.840]  I haven't... I don't think I've said that in like eight or nine years. How did you remember it?
[11:08.120 --> 11:14.260]  I don't know. I just did. I'll tell you why, Gavin. Because you matter to me.
[11:15.160 --> 11:19.720]  And the things that you say stick with me. I love that. That's special.
[11:21.380 --> 11:28.960]  Uh, last week I foolishly f***ed myself by starting, uh, just challenging Andrew. Got bored.
[11:29.560 --> 11:36.580]  Thought I'd take him on. Challenging him to, uh, trials. He beat me back. He beat my time while
[11:36.580 --> 11:41.180]  we were recording. I beat his time back. And then he continued to not only beat my time,
[11:41.180 --> 11:46.360]  but then just keep playing and beating his own time so much that I didn't possibly have a chance.
[11:46.940 --> 11:51.100]  Well, okay. So what happened was I didn't know the setup. We have a lot to talk about because
[11:51.100 --> 11:56.400]  you guys did a fireplace video that I know nothing about as far as I know it's still exporting. Or
[11:56.400 --> 12:00.200]  maybe it didn't even happen at all. Maybe you couldn't even start the fireplace. But I knew
[12:00.200 --> 12:04.800]  you were... okay. Well, I knew you guys were filming it and I saw you pop in the trials to
[12:04.800 --> 12:09.340]  try to beat the time back. So I thought it'd be really funny if I didn't know what the capture
[12:09.340 --> 12:14.200]  setup was. If somebody caught your reaction of realizing that I had lowered the time a little
[12:14.200 --> 12:19.080]  bit while you were trying to get the new time. Uh, and I lowered it by a lot more than I
[12:19.080 --> 12:23.560]  anticipated. I had a really good run and it popped into like the top thousand. Because we're already
[12:23.560 --> 12:29.300]  at the point where we're shaving off like 0.05 of a second, maybe 0.1 if we're lucky. And then
[12:29.300 --> 12:34.100]  we all saw you pop up online. Firstly, I should say that in the middle of filming this fireplace
[12:34.100 --> 12:40.480]  video, Geoff and I left to go get an Xbox so that I could play trials. Turns out that eight hours
[12:40.480 --> 12:45.920]  is a really, really long time. You have time for lots of activities in eight hours. Yeah,
[12:45.960 --> 12:51.860]  we're just driving around. Came back, play some trials, but we all saw you log on. So we knew
[12:51.860 --> 12:55.820]  what was happening. I thought you were either trying to trap a score or, uh, or you're just
[12:55.820 --> 13:00.360]  trying to beat your score. So we watched your replay because once you get your time good enough,
[13:00.360 --> 13:05.580]  I think it's in the top 5,000 or something, the top 2,000. You can actually watch that person's
[13:05.580 --> 13:09.980]  replay. And then we were like studying your replay and then we went to study it again.
[13:10.040 --> 13:15.680]  And it was completely different. You went from doing all these kinds of flips to a weird back
[13:15.680 --> 13:22.100]  flip to just no flips, just driving to the end. And it was so fun. You shaved off, I think,
[13:22.160 --> 13:26.840]  0.3 seconds. Yeah, it was a big, it was a big shave off. Was that captured?
[13:26.840 --> 13:32.380]  Was it like you guys recording or something? No, not really. We were mainly focused on just
[13:32.380 --> 13:37.600]  the fire. And I was immediately, I think I was miserable within six seconds of playing.
[13:37.860 --> 13:44.380]  It was, it was so fun to watch Gavin, who's such an upbeat, you know, peppy guy typically,
[13:44.840 --> 13:50.900]  just instantly, instantly get fucking miserable and depressed. Like he, we plugged it in,
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.180]  we got it all set up. We're like, I don't know, fucking maybe six minutes in.
[13:56.840 --> 14:00.920]  To what's going to be six hours of Gavin playing trials. Well, he just goes,
[14:01.160 --> 14:06.540]  ah, sucks. I can't believe I, oh, and it was like, Gavin, you've only tried five times.
[14:06.580 --> 14:09.220]  You can't be mad yet. And he was just already in his feelings.
[14:09.920 --> 14:13.880]  Because I get this, I get this point where I'm sort of in the zone for about five or six attempts.
[14:14.020 --> 14:18.060]  And then I just start autopiloting terrible to the point where I'm not even paying attention.
[14:18.160 --> 14:22.140]  I don't even know what I'm doing. I'm like, I forget whether I'm leaning forwards or backwards.
[14:22.320 --> 14:26.200]  And I do that for like half an hour. Do you want to see a picture of me attempting it?
[14:26.200 --> 14:29.680]  I would love to see a photo of you attempting it. I don't know why you did it. We talked
[14:29.680 --> 14:34.180]  about this before. You hate playing the game. You just think it looks ugly. Oh, Jack.
[14:34.440 --> 14:42.560]  You brought in Jack as like a pinch hitter. That makes me even happier.
[14:43.080 --> 14:46.660]  Here's something about the eight hour video. I was saying there was a lot of time.
[14:47.020 --> 14:52.000]  We had enough time to call Jack, tell him to come over. Jack was like, I'm not even ready.
[14:52.180 --> 14:55.140]  I got to take a shower. And we're like, we've got plenty of time, buddy.
[14:55.140 --> 14:59.460]  Jack took a shower, drove all the way across town. And then he still had probably six hours
[14:59.460 --> 15:01.860]  there of just playing trials over and over again.
[15:02.160 --> 15:07.220]  And if you hadn't beaten so much of your own time, I think Jack would have been the one.
[15:07.260 --> 15:11.720]  It's just you shaved off 0.3 of a second. And he was edging closer and closer.
[15:11.940 --> 15:17.240]  I will say the wildest thing was watching Gavin before he called in Jack,
[15:17.520 --> 15:22.600]  improved his time considerably. And actually to the point where I think he probably beat some
[15:22.600 --> 15:27.260]  your earlier times, but you had already blown past him. But there was progress the entire eight
[15:27.260 --> 15:31.780]  hours. And then Jack came and he kept getting closer and closer. But it was just insurmountable
[15:31.780 --> 15:36.220]  the lead that you built. It was honestly a joy. Well, firstly, Jack couldn't have been more
[15:36.220 --> 15:43.020]  excited to come over and play trials. He sat down. It was like watching someone come back
[15:43.620 --> 15:48.100]  to their favorite chair. Everything just felt right in his hand. He was like, oh yeah.
[15:48.100 --> 15:51.420]  And he immediately was like beating my time. It's like probably within
[15:51.960 --> 15:58.580]  eight or so attempts. He was in the green, but it just couldn't be done. He was really struggling
[15:58.580 --> 16:03.260]  right at the end there. And then the fire went out and we packed up and left. That's so funny
[16:03.260 --> 16:08.440]  because I gave you extra time because I didn't know if every time I beat my time, if then you
[16:08.440 --> 16:14.060]  should have 24 hours from that time. So I offered you like, I'll give you another full day if you
[16:14.060 --> 16:17.340]  want it. And you're like, no, I'm going to take the loss. I had no idea it was because Jack was playing.
[16:18.100 --> 16:23.960]  What was my response? I think you said like, fuck off, I'll eat the gum.
[16:26.280 --> 16:33.100]  I feel like 2023 is going to be all about Gavin taking L's. Like he's definitely taken a loss
[16:33.100 --> 16:39.080]  on the trials thing. Definitely took a loss on the Monopoly money. I'm assuming it is now 2023.
[16:39.840 --> 16:45.040]  I mean, we can't be forgetting that any time I go head to head with Andrew, I lose. The only time
[16:45.040 --> 16:49.760]  Andrew loses is when he's against himself trying to eat burgers. If he's against me, he's good.
[16:50.120 --> 16:55.300]  The only person that Andrew can't beat is Andrew. It's true. I was going to say I'm undefeated
[16:55.300 --> 17:00.140]  against myself, but it's the opposite. What is never winning? What is a streak of always losing?
[17:01.180 --> 17:06.020]  What would be a word for that? Loser? Stupid loser? But it's against me. Like,
[17:06.080 --> 17:10.480]  is there a word that is like the equivalent of undefeated but unwinning? Yeah, you're like,
[17:10.480 --> 17:17.660]  I think it encompasses that. Yeah, no, that's fair. I'm a face against myself, I guess. I don't
[17:17.660 --> 17:22.960]  know. There's like a weird phrasing of that. But yeah, I don't I'm committed for the entirety of
[17:22.960 --> 17:27.300]  the show. However long it goes. I don't want to lose a single video game bet to Gavin. That is
[17:27.300 --> 17:31.760]  my goal. So far, I've been able to maintain to that. Is there a game where I would have the
[17:31.760 --> 17:37.320]  edge? I just don't I don't think I think my just base level skill isn't good. I want you to find
[17:37.320 --> 17:43.700]  one. Andrew sounds like he's in a tent. Are you running away from your microphone? Are you scared
[17:43.700 --> 17:50.420]  of your microphone? I haven't done anything. He sounds like he's in his own mouth. 2023 is off
[17:50.420 --> 17:56.120]  to a technical difficulty start. That's great. I didn't do anything. Where'd you go? What'd you do?
[17:56.240 --> 18:00.780]  Are you trying to print something? Can you hear me? What's different about your setup? Nothing.
[18:00.900 --> 18:05.960]  I literally changed nothing. Okay, here's the thing. I don't believe that at all. What's
[18:05.960 --> 18:11.980]  different about your setup? I didn't touch a single thing. I don't my phone. I just don't believe it.
[18:12.180 --> 18:16.380]  I just why would my phone? I don't know. I push the wire and I guess harder. I don't know if the
[18:16.380 --> 18:20.440]  wire came loose, but I don't I don't know. I didn't do anything. Are you in the browser still?
[18:20.740 --> 18:26.040]  Yeah, of course. Still in the browser. Clear your cash. We can't hear you. Why would I download
[18:26.040 --> 18:30.060]  the app? The browser works great. Oh, it's fantastic. I think I did download the browser
[18:30.060 --> 18:37.760]  after the MVP issue or the app, not the browser. I got to have my tabs up. Got my notes for the
[18:37.760 --> 18:42.900]  show. Got everything I need. Could I do that in the app? I'd have to click away. I'd be lost.
[18:43.500 --> 18:45.960]  While we're talking briefly about video games, I just want to say something.
[18:46.680 --> 18:52.020]  Do you guys know a while back I was Millie and I were going through all of Halo together to get
[18:52.020 --> 18:58.660]  ready for Halo Infinite and then Infinite launched without co-op and then continued not to have co-op
[18:58.660 --> 19:06.060]  until about a month ago. And so when we realized, but where we stopped was, you know, we had the
[19:06.060 --> 19:10.040]  time of our lives going through all of that. And I think I probably talked about how like weird and
[19:10.040 --> 19:16.060]  rewarding and awesome it was to like play Halo with like really play the campaign with Millie
[19:16.060 --> 19:20.400]  for the first time. And how you downloaded Halo 4 separately, even though it's in the Master Chief.
[19:20.560 --> 19:25.740]  Right, right, right. And like just getting to show her like old RVB Easter eggs and have it like
[19:25.740 --> 19:31.960]  for once be cool to her, what I do, you know. And as we kind of bonded and kind of fell in love with
[19:31.960 --> 19:38.020]  Halo with each other there. But we stopped at Halo 5. Like we got about halfway through Halo 5 and
[19:38.020 --> 19:41.800]  we were both looked at each other. We were like, we're just not feeling this. We just threw in
[19:41.800 --> 19:45.860]  the towel. That's fair. So when Infinite came out, I was like, shit, we better get back on the game.
[19:45.960 --> 19:49.900]  Let's go play Infinite. And Millie was like, we can't until we finish Halo 5. And so we hemmed
[19:49.900 --> 19:55.920]  and hawed and we put it off for like three weeks. And we just went through and finished Halo 5
[19:55.920 --> 20:00.520]  over the weekend. I don't know what my fucking problem was. We had the most fun. I guess I just
[20:00.520 --> 20:06.120]  needed time from four to five or time from all the previous Halo games because we were going one
[20:06.120 --> 20:10.620]  after another hot and heavy. And then we hit five and it just like ground to a halt. How far into
[20:10.620 --> 20:16.680]  five? We were like maybe five levels in when we stopped. And I think it's a 14 level game. But
[20:16.680 --> 20:21.220]  some of those levels are bullshit. Just like running around talking to like Halsey or on
[20:21.220 --> 20:28.500]  saying Helios or whatever, you know, they're not like real levels. But I guess taking the year off
[20:28.500 --> 20:34.940]  or whatever or the distance helped. I had the time of my life beating Halo 5 with her and completely
[20:34.940 --> 20:40.220]  and totally enjoyed it. And I don't know why I played through the game. I think this is my fourth
[20:40.220 --> 20:44.100]  time beating it, I think. And I don't remember enjoying it in the first three times, but I had
[20:44.100 --> 20:49.020]  this time. I really, I really don't. Maybe it's because we broke it up or just played it. I don't
[20:49.020 --> 20:53.840]  know. But it was like a fucking blast. I think you had a really good time with Millie and Halo
[20:53.840 --> 20:59.320]  5 was there. I don't know. Level 13 where we had to fight the three, what do you call them? The
[20:59.320 --> 21:03.520]  Warden Eternals or whatever. The Warden Eternal who splits into three. That was a lot of fun.
[21:03.700 --> 21:11.420]  This is a good level. I remember really enjoying it. Maybe I need to revisit it. I hated Halo 5.
[21:11.420 --> 21:17.180]  Maybe it's because you, like, maybe just, yeah, maybe you just need time away from other Halo
[21:17.180 --> 21:21.640]  to play it. Like, you just need distance to appreciate it for what it is. But anyway,
[21:22.240 --> 21:26.060]  I'm excited to play Infinite now because I want to know what the fuck happens after
[21:26.060 --> 21:30.940]  beating Halo 5. I had a big problem with the spawns in that game. With the spawns? They just
[21:30.940 --> 21:35.720]  like come out of portals and you never know how close you are to being done with an area. Yeah.
[21:36.060 --> 21:39.760]  Yeah, that's true. I don't feel like, would you say Halo Infinite has much to do with 5, Gavin?
[21:39.760 --> 21:43.900]  I don't think those stories really connect at all. I feel like they drop a lot of stuff from
[21:43.900 --> 21:50.340]  Halo 5 and Infinite. Yeah, I'd say 5 is almost completely irrelevant. But it ends, it ends with,
[21:50.480 --> 21:54.500]  all right, well, I don't want spoilers because I haven't played it yet, but it ends with Cortana
[21:54.500 --> 22:04.700]  convincing most of the other AI to join her mission, her plan to enforce peace by force.
[22:04.700 --> 22:09.420]  And then, like, if you beat it in Legendary, you get a cutscene where she turns a halo on.
[22:10.280 --> 22:15.400]  So then I assume, my assumption is that Halo Infinite now takes place on that halo and they're
[22:15.400 --> 22:19.380]  still trying to track down Cortana and stop her or convince her to knock it off or whatever.
[22:19.640 --> 22:23.200]  Is that not the case? Is that, is none of that in Halo Infinite? No, I don't think it is. You have
[22:23.200 --> 22:28.780]  to be prepared for there to be a huge chunk of time missing between Halo 5 and Infinite. And I
[22:28.780 --> 22:33.900]  think, yeah, there's a bit of Halo Wars 2 that bridges the gap and it's a whole thing. It's
[22:33.900 --> 22:38.740]  different. Well, we'll get to it eventually. It's good. I'm excited for you to play that.
[22:38.940 --> 22:41.760]  Thanks. Yeah, this is not a video game podcast, so I don't want to get too deep in the weeds, but
[22:41.760 --> 22:45.600]  I just gotta say that my opinion of Halo 5 changed over time.
[22:46.700 --> 22:49.780]  Am I allowed, Andrew, to challenge you to a game that you've never played?
[22:50.580 --> 22:53.500]  Yeah, of course. To give you 24 hours on a completely foreign experience?
[22:53.820 --> 22:58.080]  Whatever you want, I'm happy with. That's gonna be really... I feel like
[22:58.080 --> 23:02.160]  anytime I challenge you, I just make you look really good. I just look like a chump.
[23:02.160 --> 23:07.760]  Listen, for every time I look good beating you in something, I'm losing six bets against myself,
[23:07.900 --> 23:11.560]  so it balances out. There's zero chance of me looking good overall.
[23:12.300 --> 23:15.300]  I don't know, you haven't done one of your own bets in a while. That burger confidence
[23:15.300 --> 23:20.080]  never grew back. No, listen, the burger confidence takes a toll. There's a genuine
[23:20.080 --> 23:24.820]  physical toll that comes. I threw in the towel on the last one. That was the retirement. I took
[23:24.820 --> 23:28.940]  one too many fights. Round two, I was like, I can't do this.
[23:29.060 --> 23:31.060]  You were Roy Jones Jr. I was.
[23:32.160 --> 23:36.040]  It was my no mas moment. I was done. I was very publicly done.
[23:36.840 --> 23:39.600]  But yeah, I'd love... you can pick whatever you want. Doesn't matter.
[23:40.400 --> 23:49.300]  Any genre, any type, any game, any challenge. Hey, should we talk about this fireplace video?
[23:49.640 --> 23:52.780]  We should talk about both of our fireplace videos. How do you guys want to address it?
[23:52.960 --> 23:57.260]  Because I know Andrew hasn't seen it yet, and you wanted to go in without any information.
[23:57.320 --> 24:01.440]  Yeah, I think it's best for the audience that we talk about it. I think it's fine.
[24:01.440 --> 24:04.200]  I'll sacrifice knowing some things in advance about it.
[24:04.320 --> 24:10.500]  Well, I'll say about a year ago, we came up with the idea to film a 4K fireplace video
[24:10.500 --> 24:14.460]  that didn't loop because we were bitching about how the fireplace videos looped. And so
[24:14.460 --> 24:20.800]  I think we joked around about making an eight hour fireplace video in 8K, rather. Because 4Ks...
[24:21.320 --> 24:25.300]  because there's a bunch of 4K fireplace videos, but we hadn't seen any that were 8K.
[24:26.240 --> 24:30.560]  And then I'll be honest with you, audience, like a lot of jokes and bits, we
[24:31.220 --> 24:35.100]  completely and totally fucking forgot about it until about a month ago,
[24:35.880 --> 24:39.360]  somewhere on social media, I saw a thread or a post that was like,
[24:39.420 --> 24:42.920]  whatever happened to that fireplace video? And we were like, oh, shit, we did promise that.
[24:43.380 --> 24:47.860]  So then we tried for about a month to get it together. But you know what scheduling us is like.
[24:48.020 --> 24:50.900]  And so it was very difficult to get it done before Christmas.
[24:50.900 --> 24:55.500]  Well, we tried for a month to put it together and then you tried for about a week to get us to not
[24:55.500 --> 25:00.360]  do it. Yeah, that was another thing, too, where like nobody wanted to do it. And I especially
[25:00.360 --> 25:07.120]  didn't want to do it. But you know what? I'm so fucking glad we did. Because I had the best time.
[25:07.480 --> 25:12.800]  I had the best time hanging out with you guys tending a fire for eight hours and coming up with
[25:12.800 --> 25:17.460]  dumb little shenanigans and stuff to do. And then it was I turned into like a party because like,
[25:17.460 --> 25:23.280]  you know, Major League fan Jack came over and Eric's small wife came over and my fiance Emily
[25:23.280 --> 25:29.140]  came over and it just turned into and there was a dog. And it was just so fun. It was a lovely
[25:29.140 --> 25:35.560]  bonding day. And I'm actually really happy with the final product. Gavin, do you want to talk
[25:35.560 --> 25:42.060]  about like the challenges of recording eight hours of 8K video uninterrupted and then trying to get
[25:42.060 --> 25:46.580]  it down to a size that can be put up on YouTube? Yeah, I will say the fun ended the second we
[25:46.580 --> 25:53.080]  stopped recording and I was trying to download. I think in total, I did the maths based on the
[25:53.080 --> 26:00.400]  fold, the Google Drive size folder. We shot nine times more data in eight hours than every single
[26:00.400 --> 26:08.460]  episode of Face combined with all of my God. And that was when you're using stereo audio and had
[26:08.460 --> 26:17.360]  double the audio size of everybody else. That was about four terabytes, right? It was about four
[26:17.360 --> 26:23.320]  terabytes, about eight and a bit, probably close to eight and a half hours of total footage. And
[26:23.320 --> 26:28.800]  the timeline I had to drop each file in, which took each one took so long to import. And every
[26:28.800 --> 26:33.120]  time I made a change in the timeline, my computer would just like pause and pinwheel for like 30
[26:33.120 --> 26:39.220]  seconds. So just to add like a crossfade by dragging one clip over so I had room to crossfade,
[26:39.300 --> 26:43.320]  then dragging the other one and then applying the crossfade took a total of like five minutes
[26:43.320 --> 26:48.160]  for each thing, just because my computer was struggling to do it. And we planned to do a bunch
[26:48.160 --> 26:52.140]  of stuff with the audio, but all I'm going to do is put on some fire crackling sounds because my
[26:52.700 --> 26:57.540]  computer, which is pretty state of the art, cannot handle an eight hour, 8K timeline.
[26:58.840 --> 27:02.780]  Gavin told Eric and I the other night he texted us that he had to turn his monitor off
[27:02.780 --> 27:09.820]  because there was such a power drop. Yeah, I guess when I had everything in the timeline and I did a
[27:09.820 --> 27:17.420]  test export, my computer drew more power than it ever has before and overloaded my UPS. It drew
[27:17.420 --> 27:24.740]  like an extra 700 watts of power and the thing was just churning out hot air. I had to bring in fans,
[27:24.960 --> 27:29.180]  I had to turn off everything else that was plugged into the UPS. Your computer was hotter than the
[27:29.180 --> 27:34.700]  fire. You achieved new levels of heat. It probably was. I think the GPU is like 80...
[27:36.000 --> 27:42.540]  87 degrees, which is much hotter than the room. Oh my god. Well, I... and you got it down to a size that
[27:42.540 --> 27:49.020]  can be uploaded to YouTube, so we will put this 8K, eight hour fireplace video up just in time for
[27:49.020 --> 27:55.920]  next Christmas. It might already be up by now. I don't know. I don't know when the plan to go up is.
[27:55.920 --> 28:00.580]  Yeah, I'm basically waiting for... I have to do some actual work on my computer and then when it's going
[28:00.580 --> 28:05.760]  to be free for an extended period, I'm going to do the full export and hope that it uploads
[28:06.460 --> 28:11.340]  to YouTube. If it goes slightly over the size, I'm still messing with settings. I'll have to just
[28:11.340 --> 28:20.200]  re-export the entire thing. It's going to suck. No! I will say, if you... when it comes out,
[28:20.440 --> 28:25.760]  if you got nothing to do for eight hours, we did stuff. Not a lot of stuff. It's easter eggy stuff,
[28:25.760 --> 28:30.980]  but we did interact with the fire in little base ways. Oh, I'm so excited. Sprinkled throughout
[28:30.980 --> 28:38.780]  the entire eight hour recording. That's great. As a stat, each frame of the video is 32 megapixels.
[28:40.940 --> 28:46.400]  Jesus. Each... fuck. Hey, I thought it was 12, but I did the math wrong. It's 32.
[28:46.620 --> 28:54.200]  Oh my god. I can't wait to watch all eight hours of this fire. Yeah, and I had an idea last night.
[28:54.200 --> 28:58.520]  I was thinking about what a success this 8K video was, and how happy I am we made it,
[28:58.640 --> 29:04.580]  and how accomplished I feel creating what should be, to my knowledge, the world's only 8K,
[29:04.680 --> 29:10.580]  eight hour, non-looping fireplace Yule Log video. They got me thinking, that's great and all,
[29:11.100 --> 29:15.700]  and it's a great accomplishment, but there's no Yule Log video for the summer.
[29:17.220 --> 29:24.300]  Why don't we invent the summer log video, and start that trend, and we'll try to figure out
[29:24.300 --> 29:27.580]  what that is. Emily and I were trying to figure out what that is. I think one summer day,
[29:27.780 --> 29:32.660]  we need to rent a pool, and then put the camera right in front of the pool, and then just push
[29:32.660 --> 29:36.340]  pool floaties back and forth for eight hours, and every once in a while, you'll see somebody dive in
[29:36.340 --> 29:43.140]  in the background. And we'll do like, I think the summer version of a Yule Log video is just a sunny
[29:43.140 --> 29:47.000]  day in a swimming pool. I could see that, yeah. And that's for people who are having like a rainy
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.460]  summer? Yeah, like if it's rainy, and you wish you were outside, or maybe you broke your leg,
[29:51.560 --> 29:57.680]  or you got sick, or you know, you're laid up in the hospital, but you want to feel the warmth,
[29:57.780 --> 30:01.500]  much like people want to feel the warmth of a fire through their TV, you want to feel the
[30:01.500 --> 30:05.960]  warmth of the sun, and splashing around in the water with your friends. So we'll make like the
[30:05.960 --> 30:12.600]  summer Yule Log video. Boom. I'm open to suggestions. This is my suggestion to y'all. I'm
[30:12.600 --> 30:17.760]  up with like the summer version of what we just did. I feel like a pool float too, like you have
[30:17.760 --> 30:23.800]  so many better comedic options for pulling stuff across the frame, like it's so easy, natural to
[30:23.800 --> 30:29.120]  do. I originally thought you meant like summer activities in a fireplace, like burger, like trying
[30:29.120 --> 30:35.840]  to make a burger in a fireplace. Eight hours of grilling hot dogs. Yeah, exactly. Like what would
[30:35.840 --> 30:40.500]  would be the summer activity? Like maybe throwing a super soaker onto the fire, like I don't know
[30:40.500 --> 30:44.980]  what that would be, but I like the pool ideas, like the alternate, the flip. It could be for people
[30:44.980 --> 30:49.340]  on the other side of the world, as Eric mentioned Australia. Absolutely. Like on the opposite side,
[30:49.480 --> 30:54.840]  some people, Christmas is the summer. So this could be maybe like their Yule Log video,
[30:55.280 --> 30:59.380]  what they would want to see. Or I guess it would be for the people here, and the summer, I don't
[30:59.380 --> 31:04.180]  know. We'll figure it out. Yeah, I just feel like the hard work was figuring out if it's possible,
[31:04.420 --> 31:08.860]  and then proving that it's possible. And now that we've done that, it's just like, it's just
[31:08.860 --> 31:12.960]  repeating what we already did in a new setting, right? And it just seems like a waste for us not
[31:12.960 --> 31:18.540]  to use that to our advantage. Yeah, from like an export setting, Gavin, would it be identical?
[31:18.760 --> 31:22.700]  Like everything, all the settings, like once you do it once, will you just know how to do it?
[31:22.860 --> 31:28.000]  You want to do 8K again? Well, I don't want to go backwards. It doesn't have to be eight hours,
[31:28.600 --> 31:33.020]  because we're setting the standard here. What if we did 8K four hour pool video? I mean, I don't
[31:33.020 --> 31:37.520]  want to spend eight hours in a pool. I'm a big water guy. That's a little long. Four hours seems
[31:37.520 --> 31:44.280]  good. I would happily spend eight hours in a pool, but I'm willing to concede to bargain it down to
[31:44.280 --> 31:50.080]  four, because we're not competing against other summer Yule Log videos, right? Like we had to do
[31:50.080 --> 31:54.280]  eight hours to set ourselves apart from the competition. I don't think we have any competition
[31:54.280 --> 32:01.800]  yet. Is 8K the highest resolution we can film in? Uh, that's 12K cameras out. Oh, 12K. Hey,
[32:01.800 --> 32:11.580]  Eric, I need the credit card. Okay, sure, whatever. Well, 12K, is it 12K on the PS5 box,
[32:11.780 --> 32:16.060]  or is it 8K on the PS5? Well, how do you even deliver 12K? Is there a video? Well,
[32:16.060 --> 32:20.500]  YouTube doesn't do 12K, does it? I didn't even know it was a thing. I had to ask you. I just
[32:20.500 --> 32:25.720]  learned about it. Oh, right. I know you're asking. You're the only one here that would know. Because
[32:25.720 --> 32:29.040]  based on the situation I'm in now with all this data, I never want to turn this camera on ever
[32:29.040 --> 32:35.200]  again. That's fair. You know, I think we need to give Gavin some time, Geoff. In like a month
[32:35.200 --> 32:40.780]  from now, I think he'll be back on board. This is in the rear view a little bit. Andrew has to pay
[32:40.780 --> 32:45.480]  for fireplace videos with marathons, and it's one for one. Well, what about the fact that I paid for
[32:45.480 --> 32:49.600]  a fireplace video by paying for my fireplace video? Does that not count for anything? I feel
[32:49.600 --> 32:54.460]  like I've already paid a fireplace video. Yeah, we saw your fireplace video. We did live commentary
[32:54.460 --> 33:01.280]  on it. It's a fireplace video. Yeah, sort of is the key word.
[33:06.170 --> 33:13.370]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp. I found in my life that it can be incredibly difficult when
[33:13.370 --> 33:19.290]  you have things going on, whether it's in your personal life or professional. It can so easily
[33:19.290 --> 33:23.670]  build on top of each other and just add more stress where you don't feel like you're your
[33:23.670 --> 33:28.910]  best self. You're struggling in some way. And then because of that struggle, you then find it hard
[33:28.910 --> 33:33.670]  to do something else. And that builds on top of it. And it can be a mess, which is why therapy
[33:33.670 --> 33:38.810]  in my experience has been so great. When you're at your best, you can do great things. But sometimes
[33:38.810 --> 33:43.490]  life gets you bogged down and you may feel overwhelmed or like you're not showing up in
[33:43.490 --> 33:47.910]  the way that you want to. Working with a therapist can help you get closer to the best version of
[33:47.910 --> 33:52.990]  you. Because when you feel empowered, you're more prepared to take on everything life throws at you.
[33:52.990 --> 33:58.390]  That is definitely an experience I've had with therapy. It has been a wonderful tool in not just
[33:58.390 --> 34:05.290]  getting a perspective on issues that I'm going through, but also helping me come up with systems
[34:05.290 --> 34:10.490]  and tools that when I am going through those things, I kind of am able to navigate them in
[34:10.490 --> 34:16.490]  a more healthier way. I would definitely recommend therapy to anybody. It was a really impactful
[34:16.490 --> 34:22.050]  experience for me. If you're thinking of giving therapy a try, BetterHelp is a great option.
[34:22.050 --> 34:27.310]  It's convenient, flexible, affordable, and entirely online. Just fill out a brief questionnaire to get

[34:47.550 --> 34:51.250]  my phone, like there's a lot of personal information that I'm accessing, whether it
[34:51.250 --> 34:56.210]  be bank stuff, placing delivery orders, like it's my credit card information, all that stuff is
[34:56.210 --> 35:00.690]  available. And the scary part is, is that your phone carrier collects data on whatever it is
[35:00.690 --> 35:05.770]  you're doing. Verizon has even admitted to it. They say it so that they can better understand
[35:05.770 --> 35:09.110]  your interests, but really all they want is to sell your activity to advertisers.
[35:09.730 --> 35:14.390]  Stuff like the sites you visited and what you've been up to online. The more they can get on you,
[35:14.470 --> 35:20.810]  the larger their paycheck becomes, which is why I use ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN is an app that
[35:20.810 --> 35:25.110]  prevents your phone carrier from being able to see the sites that you visit and sell it off to
[35:25.110 --> 35:30.790]  third parties. All it takes is one tap of a button and all of your network data gets encrypted and
[35:30.790 --> 35:36.670]  rerouted through ExpressVPN secure servers for ultimate privacy. Not only does it shield your
[35:36.670 --> 35:42.590]  web browsing, ExpressVPN protects all of your network data so you can stay private even when
[35:42.590 --> 35:48.810]  using your favorite apps. Whether you're an iPhone, Android, or even a tablet user, ExpressVPN works on
[35:48.810 --> 35:54.450]  all of your devices. The best part is, one subscription can be used up to 5 devices at
[35:54.450 --> 36:00.790]  the same time. I have my whole family using ExpressVPN too. When your phone carrier tracks
[36:00.790 --> 36:05.190]  you, that's a gross invasion of privacy. You can either keep letting them cash in on you,
[36:05.510 --> 36:12.490]  or visit expressvpn.com to get the same VPN I use. Take back your online privacy today

[37:44.030 --> 37:53.050]  What do you attribute your absolute inability to start a fire to? Several factors. One, time.
[37:53.130 --> 37:58.130]  I was going to prep a little bit more. We changed the recording schedule. I was going to set it up
[37:58.130 --> 38:05.170]  a little bit differently. Two, being scared at when I did it that I would alert other people
[38:05.170 --> 38:10.410]  in the building as well as create a big fire. That's why I had the Gerpler there. It's undeniably
[38:10.410 --> 38:16.570]  the worst fireplace video ever made. I had to have the fireplace upside down, the chimneys on the
[38:16.570 --> 38:22.110]  side. It's so cold out. I'm in my underwear. I'm shivering, trying to light it. Fire did not
[38:22.110 --> 38:27.470]  provide warmth. Hang on. Why are you in your underwear? Because I had no time, Eric. There
[38:27.470 --> 38:31.990]  is no time to put on shorts because of the cutoff. The day you got moved the day earlier,
[38:32.210 --> 38:37.610]  so you had to take your pants off. No, I already had the pants off. The pants were already off.
[38:37.650 --> 38:42.310]  If the pants were on, then I would have no time to take the pants off. I was in my underwear while
[38:42.310 --> 38:48.730]  I made it. I made everything in my underwear. Then it was past the cutoff time in my building for
[38:48.730 --> 38:56.070]  making noise. I didn't want to alert people. What's the cutoff? 10pm. There's no sound in that
[38:56.070 --> 39:03.590]  video. I mean, you are deathly silent. Because I planned on putting music into it, I didn't
[39:03.590 --> 39:08.070]  expect to send it when I did. I was still going to do some final touches to it. There's no audio
[39:08.070 --> 39:11.370]  because I was trying to be quiet because I didn't want to alert anybody. So I was like, I'll throw
[39:11.370 --> 39:16.070]  music into this. Because I lived, there were people all around me. And my light being on.
[39:16.230 --> 39:19.610]  It's a whole thing. It's a whole situation. I didn't want to disturb people. I had no time for
[39:19.610 --> 39:23.650]  pants. I'm wearing a short-sleeved shirt and underwear, and I'm shivering in that video.
[39:24.850 --> 39:28.390]  Extensively. It was terrifying. Have you spent more or less than 50%
[39:28.390 --> 39:35.830]  of our recording time in your underwear? More or less? Oh, wait, let me evaluate this. More
[39:35.830 --> 39:40.250]  time in my underwear or less time? Is that what you're saying? Yeah, 50%.
[39:40.250 --> 39:45.770]  More than, oh, way more than 50. Has most of Face been... Oh, undeniably more. Absolutely.
[39:46.170 --> 39:51.050]  I like to be comfortable. We went over this. I mean, Geoff does his swim shorts, right?
[39:51.050 --> 39:58.510]  Yeah. Well, not in a long time. He's moved on. Not since the jock itch. Yeah,
[40:00.030 --> 40:04.990]  pretty much since the jock itch, I've stopped wearing swim trunks. And oh, dude, by the way,
[40:05.090 --> 40:09.150]  I will say Emily got me these fucking, this is not a product endorsement by any stretch, but
[40:10.650 --> 40:15.890]  Emily got me this underwear for Christmas called Saks. Have you guys heard of it? I don't know if
[40:16.470 --> 40:21.550]  I don't know if it's proprietary to that brand or if like lots of underwear has it,
[40:21.850 --> 40:28.570]  but it has like a little, it's like a boxer briefs like I wear, but it has like a little pouch you
[40:28.570 --> 40:34.250]  stick your balls in and then your balls no longer rub against the side of your leg because they're
[40:34.250 --> 40:39.110]  protected in this little pouch. And I'm going to throw away every pair of underwear I own and
[40:39.110 --> 40:43.710]  replace it with Saks or some other brand. I wouldn't think I would like it either,
[40:43.710 --> 40:51.850]  but it's amazing. You know, my fear is that putting your balls in that sack is like becoming a
[40:51.850 --> 40:56.250]  fighter with bad head movement. Like if something's going to hit my balls, I feel like they're up on a
[40:56.250 --> 41:01.730]  pedestal and there's no no, no, it's more bob and weave. It's more like it's just the impact.
[41:02.050 --> 41:07.430]  It just like it just hugs them the tiniest bit and creates separation from the rest.
[41:07.570 --> 41:10.590]  So you just have to like put them on and then thumb your testicles through a hole.
[41:11.170 --> 41:17.630]  Well, my balls are bigger than a thumb, but yeah, I use all hands to slap them puppies in there.
[41:17.830 --> 41:21.790]  Uh, put them in a sack. Yeah, it's just like it's just like two little don't like I'll show you.
[41:22.010 --> 41:27.590]  I'll show you. Not today, but all I'm picturing is those like castration bands they put around the
[41:27.590 --> 41:34.290]  no. Like, how do you know it's not going to fall off? They're not. It's not uncomfortable at all.
[41:34.530 --> 41:38.950]  I imagine it's like a pocket for your balls. Yeah, it's more like a pocket for your balls.
[41:40.770 --> 41:44.270]  But I don't like that. My balls aren't all over my legs. They're contained.
[41:44.530 --> 41:47.390]  They will be when you get older. Oh, I don't wear briefs. I wear boxer briefs.
[41:48.950 --> 41:54.190]  Oh, wait, what do I? I need room for my balls to move. They need to bob and weave. Gavin, do you not know
[41:54.190 --> 41:58.410]  what kind of underwear you wear? I think boxer briefs. What's the difference between briefs and
[41:58.410 --> 42:04.190]  boxer briefs? Uh, briefs are like tighty whities. Oh, I wear boxer briefs, but I feel like...
[42:04.190 --> 42:09.990]  This is what they they do. Saks underwear. And it's just like it's, you know, like I said,
[42:09.990 --> 42:13.870]  I don't know who these people are or anything. I'm certainly not shilling for them. But I don't know.
[42:13.950 --> 42:17.190]  There may be a ton of brands that do this. This is just the one I know about. But goddamn it, dude.
[42:17.250 --> 42:21.330]  I've never worn a pair of underwear that's comfortable in my life. It just looked like normal boxer briefs.
[42:21.350 --> 42:25.470]  Yeah, I don't know if you could see the see the pouch. Here you go. Uh, they have a ballpark pouch or a
[42:25.470 --> 42:32.250]  ballpark pouch pro. What's the pouch pro? Professional testicle pouches. I wish you could see
[42:33.030 --> 42:37.590]  the pouch better in the... Well, anyway, buy a pair sometime or maybe I'll get them for you for a gift
[42:37.590 --> 42:41.470]  sometime like I did with the socks back in the day. Oh, that'd be nice. It's really like it's
[42:41.470 --> 42:46.530]  it's it's one of those like life changing things. Like when I discovered good socks or when I
[42:46.530 --> 42:51.990]  discovered that I could blow dry myself dry with the with the blow dryer. It's like it's going to
[42:51.990 --> 42:58.650]  inform how I move forward in my life. I'm a skeptic, but I was I was too. I was too. I thought
[42:58.650 --> 43:02.070]  it was a gimmick. I was like, oh, that's nice. And then I put them on and it just like it was
[43:02.070 --> 43:10.870]  instant game changer. Patented ballpark pouch. Patented. They're fucking. Yeah, I'll try.
[43:13.130 --> 43:19.010]  Delightful. Ballpark pouch. Oh, here you go. Here you go. Here's a diagram. Yeah, I got diagram. Let
[43:19.010 --> 43:25.770]  me show you. And my head, it's just like a pocket on the front of a shirt, but balls.
[43:26.750 --> 43:31.350]  Trying to get verification of this. I still don't like it. Not even that I don't think it works. I
[43:31.350 --> 43:37.050]  just as I said, I want my balls to roam a little bit. Once you get. Well, I'll tell you what, dude,
[43:37.770 --> 43:45.670]  I'm older. I'm an older dude. You probably have you probably have young, like firm balls. The
[43:45.670 --> 43:51.050]  older you get, your gravity takes over, man. Your balls just keep dangling lower and lower and
[43:51.050 --> 43:56.630]  lower. And and it's it helps to collect them. Let's see if I can find this thing. Are you doing
[43:56.630 --> 44:02.050]  a yearly measurement of the ascension of your ball? I should. I should. There you go. That's
[44:02.050 --> 44:09.990]  how. Oh, OK. Oh, so you've. Why are the balls red? Well, there's soft mesh panels.
[44:10.990 --> 44:14.470]  Just a little, little, little, little life pro tip for you out there.
[44:14.850 --> 44:17.770]  Little life hack. Buy a different pair of underwear.
[44:20.310 --> 44:25.490]  That's fucking great. I was bummed today. I got two pair. I woke up this morning. I was excited
[44:25.490 --> 44:28.350]  to put them on. And I saw they were both dirty. And I was like, goddamn it. I'm wearing traditional
[44:28.350 --> 44:32.490]  underwear. I'm fucking miserable. There are I feel like two types of people when it comes to beds.
[44:32.530 --> 44:38.170]  Like some people like their sheet to be tucked under the mattress. So you're like, yeah, by the
[44:38.170 --> 44:42.770]  no. And some people like a leg out or just like complete freedom. And I'm definitely a freedom
[44:42.770 --> 44:47.570]  sleep. Absolute free. I hate a tucked sheet or duvet. So I'm worried I'm worried that will leak
[44:47.570 --> 44:54.950]  over into the way I like my testicles. Oh, no. Well, testicle change. I will say I used to be
[44:54.950 --> 45:00.990]  tucked in person and now an Emily is not. So I've grown to be a non-tucked in persons that I like.
[45:01.130 --> 45:05.750]  I kick my legs out now, too, at night because I get a little too hot sometimes. And so I've like
[45:05.750 --> 45:10.130]  straddle both sides and I don't I don't notice any. I mean, it just feels like a ball hug,
[45:10.210 --> 45:18.590]  like a really gentle, gentle, non-invasive in any way. Just like they can imagine like a tiny
[45:18.590 --> 45:24.770]  little teddy bear about the maybe the size of a penis that just comes up and just cradles and
[45:24.770 --> 45:29.010]  hugs your balls. It's just delightful. It's like I'm in the middle of the ad read.
[45:31.490 --> 45:37.650]  I had a funny discovery recently when doing an ad read where I got sent copy and like most of
[45:37.650 --> 45:43.950]  the copy you get for doing ad reads is just like generic. It's for any show could read it. And I
[45:43.950 --> 45:47.990]  looked at it was a company that I'd never heard of. And I read it and I was like, oh, shit. They
[45:47.990 --> 45:53.550]  said regulation in the thing like this is this is somewhat this is related to us. Like open with like
[45:53.550 --> 45:57.990]  regulation listener. I was like, this is great. I went to share it with someone and I was like,
[45:58.030 --> 46:02.910]  look at this. It's so cool. Look, this ad it's written specifically for us. And I went to
[46:02.910 --> 46:08.810]  reread it and I kind of stumbled and I realized it didn't say regulation. It just said regular.
[46:08.990 --> 46:15.210]  And my brain now automatically changes regular into regulation because I use regulation so much
[46:15.210 --> 46:20.550]  more than regular face. Vernacular has taken over. It is like the autocorrect of my mind.
[46:20.550 --> 46:26.310]  Wait, so it said regular listener? It just said regular listener or something like that. It said
[46:26.310 --> 46:33.330]  just a normal, regular thing. I should pull up the ad read. But I was so excited and I was like,
[46:33.370 --> 46:38.590]  listen, look at this ad. And I went to reread it and I felt so stupid that I that I personally
[46:38.590 --> 46:46.330]  inserted the regulation. Did you say regulation in the ad read in the end? No, I didn't. I did
[46:46.330 --> 46:51.610]  not. I should have. I was like, there's like six different versions of it, but it's just more like
[46:51.610 --> 46:57.210]  shocking that and it made me happy that face vernacular has just entered into my primary way.
[46:57.350 --> 47:01.690]  You know, speaking much like you're not allowed to say trash anymore and you're only allowed to
[47:01.690 --> 47:07.550]  say rubbish for the rest of your life. We should all just commit to never saying regular again,
[47:07.550 --> 47:13.270]  but just just replacing with regulation. Oh, God. So like when it comes to size,
[47:13.270 --> 47:21.010]  that becomes an issue, I think. Like a regulation. You're really going to be the one
[47:21.010 --> 47:25.870]  that that complains about size and specifics of size and accurate measurements. You're
[47:25.870 --> 47:33.150]  going to be the one that that leads us into this subject. Keep my mouth shut, I guess.
[47:33.310 --> 47:37.890]  Going back and listening. The ad was regular listeners of this podcast. It was the opening
[47:37.890 --> 47:41.990]  and I immediately absolutely should be regulation listeners of this podcast.
[47:42.230 --> 47:47.330]  Oh, my God. Yeah, I should have. Yeah. Good lord. I think I went the different one. But anyway,
[47:47.330 --> 47:53.730]  it was just it was funny to realize how. How are you guys feeling about 2023 so far? We are three
[47:53.730 --> 47:59.370]  days into the year. Twenty three as a year. What do you mean? In what context? So far, pretty good.
[47:59.610 --> 48:04.010]  You know, summer. There's no kidding. Right. I went for a bike ride today and I got too hot.
[48:04.010 --> 48:09.590]  I was like, fuck, I wish I was. It was minus 10 like a week ago and now it's 28.
[48:10.010 --> 48:16.610]  I don't make sense to Celsius people, but that is a swing. It was 15 degrees in Austin and now it's
[48:16.610 --> 48:27.690]  80 for the Fahrenheit people, which would probably be most of us. I guess I mean, like, you know,
[48:28.370 --> 48:35.310]  at the end of the year, you typically like get reflective and then you get excited. You kind of
[48:35.310 --> 48:39.210]  like close the chapter on like twenty twenty two and then you get excited about twenty twenty three.
[48:39.310 --> 48:44.330]  At least I do. I would always like take up about I take the most of the month of December and kind
[48:44.330 --> 48:48.450]  of evaluate like I'll just use Achievement Hunter as an example, like what we did right and wrong
[48:48.450 --> 48:52.970]  and Achievement Hunter directions. I want to go in twenty twenty three. What you know, what kind
[48:52.970 --> 48:57.490]  of content did well, where we're where we want to head and just kind of get like a like a creative
[48:57.490 --> 49:02.910]  reset and then get excited about building and starting fresh in the new year. And I tried to
[49:02.910 --> 49:08.910]  do that with Face this year, like I always do every year in my career. And I think I'll be honest.
[49:09.010 --> 49:15.230]  I think I took I'll put this in terms. I think I took so much psychic damage in twenty twenty two.
[49:15.410 --> 49:21.790]  My brain is just not ready yet. Like I have been like lethargic and kind of just like I can't wait.
[49:21.890 --> 49:26.850]  Emily bought a Emily's got like a yearly planner and a book and she like it's getting up at six
[49:26.850 --> 49:30.990]  a.m. and like doing all the New Year's resolution type stuff. And I can't make myself get out of
[49:30.990 --> 49:35.670]  bed these days. And I just I can't flip the switch into twenty twenty three. And it's really bumming
[49:35.670 --> 49:42.250]  me. I've got like which is something that I'm lucky. I'm very fortunate in that I never have
[49:42.250 --> 49:47.870]  like creative block. Very rarely do I have it. Yeah, I have it so fucking hard right now. I can't
[49:47.870 --> 49:52.890]  focus on stuff. I can't figure out like I can't come up with bits. I don't have any like any kind
[49:52.890 --> 49:58.270]  of like North Star to work towards. I'm just having a real hard time switching gears into
[49:58.270 --> 50:03.850]  twenty twenty three. And then it's just been such an eventful. We're three days into twenty twenty
[50:03.850 --> 50:11.570]  three. And it's been just like it's a bit tragic like. Oh, yeah. Jeremy Renner getting run over by
[50:11.570 --> 50:17.990]  the snowplow, which is horrific. Demar Hamlin having the cardiac arrest on on the field
[50:18.450 --> 50:24.830]  yesterday. Ken Block dying in a snowmobile accident, which is wild because I am in the
[50:24.830 --> 50:28.690]  process of trying to figure out how to switch from being a Texas guy to maybe someday being
[50:28.690 --> 50:32.930]  a Michigan guy. And one of the ways I'm going to do that is trade jet skis for snowmobiles.
[50:33.070 --> 50:37.270]  And now I'm like, I don't know. And then I found out today in the fucking Howard Stern show,
[50:37.290 --> 50:40.870]  and it happened a couple like a couple of weeks ago, but I discovered it in twenty twenty three.
[50:41.210 --> 50:44.730]  This may not mean much to anybody except for Eric, but Fred, the elephant boy died,
[50:45.190 --> 50:50.530]  who's like a long, long term Stern show whack packer, just heartbreaking. And it's just like,
[50:50.590 --> 50:54.250]  fuck, we're three days into the year. Barbara Walters died five days ago. It's like we're
[50:54.250 --> 51:00.110]  Barbara Walters died. Are you serious? Really? You didn't know that? I know. I know. I didn't
[51:00.110 --> 51:06.570]  know that. Yeah. Barbara Walters died December 30th. It was that's crazy. Huge news. I decided
[51:06.570 --> 51:13.550]  that we didn't kill any of these people. Uh, well, OK. So you say that we did, but it is an
[51:13.550 --> 51:19.050]  unfortunate timing that the episode that just came out today has an extensive conversation about
[51:19.050 --> 51:25.010]  us talking about athletes dying during sporting events, which is even though we filmed that
[51:25.010 --> 51:31.050]  probably that was three weeks ago. Yeah. Like that's very unfortunate. Timing is obviously
[51:31.050 --> 51:35.650]  not great, but that's it's creepy. It is. It's a freaky thing that that timed out the way it did.
[51:35.730 --> 51:41.370]  Just like it's like I'm a little scared for tomorrow, you know? That's fair. I mean,
[51:41.370 --> 51:46.330]  call this the 34th of December. Just keep keep it going. I don't know. That's actually
[51:46.330 --> 51:50.430]  what anybody else is having trouble kickstart kickstarting the new year because it is
[51:50.430 --> 51:55.570]  it is kicking my ass. I just can't get out of 2022. So I kind of kickstarted in a way I didn't
[51:55.570 --> 52:00.210]  expect where I've gotten really into coins for like the last three or four days. And that is
[52:00.210 --> 52:05.530]  sort of carried me into, I think, just having a new hobby to naturally look at, looking like
[52:05.530 --> 52:11.730]  explore. I inherited a coin collection and just like going through and cataloging coins. It's
[52:11.730 --> 52:15.170]  just something I had zero interest in. It's like something I would never thought I would pursue.
[52:15.630 --> 52:20.090]  I don't think I will be on the collection that I currently have, but just being given a thing
[52:20.090 --> 52:24.030]  that is like generational coins and sorting through it has been a really fun process.
[52:24.330 --> 52:28.570]  Well, like Canadian currency? Largely Canadian currency, but also just like some random
[52:28.570 --> 52:36.050]  stuff. Like I have a a German note that was made during wartime of the first war that isn't like
[52:36.050 --> 52:40.630]  official currency, but they had to honor it because of like what was happening in the world
[52:40.630 --> 52:45.550]  at that time. Like a wartime promissory note kind of thing? Yeah, essentially. Yeah. From like the
[52:45.550 --> 52:51.030]  first war, which is crazy. Like it's a rare thing. And then I have a coin of like two or three coins
[52:51.030 --> 52:57.370]  from 1898, which is just like fucking crazy to think about. Just all the different amounts of
[52:57.370 --> 53:01.010]  history that has happened from then to now. Is this your way of telling us that you've started
[53:01.010 --> 53:10.870]  a sock collection? What? What? I was thinking that's the last time we had a story about coins.
[53:12.550 --> 53:16.970]  No, I'm not, Geoff. I was so confused I didn't even get that. That's how
[53:18.250 --> 53:23.690]  nonsensical. You were talking to me about the coin collection. I was really excited about it
[53:23.690 --> 53:27.930]  and excited for you. We were talking about the other day and I realized there's one question I
[53:27.930 --> 53:31.630]  forgot to ask that I'm curious about. How many coins approximately is your collection?
[53:32.690 --> 53:38.190]  Oh, a couple hundred. So hundreds. That's why. Yeah, I'd say like 300 coins, 400 maybe. It's
[53:38.190 --> 53:41.410]  tough. Like I've gone through most of it. I still have some rolled coins to go through, but
[53:41.410 --> 53:49.110]  it's mainly ranging, I'd say, from like 1960 to 2008. So not exactly the most exciting,
[53:49.110 --> 53:55.990]  more recent stuff, but there are some old like 50 cent pieces from like 1898 is the oldest one I
[53:55.990 --> 54:03.330]  found to like 1930 or 40. And those are just wild to go through. Have you done any research into
[54:03.330 --> 54:07.970]  like coin care and how you're supposed to take care of them and stuff? So that's the next step,
[54:08.090 --> 54:12.110]  for sure, because there's some that definitely require it. Like the one that I found from
[54:12.850 --> 54:19.470]  1898 was in a prescription pill bottle from like 1972. It just hasn't been moved since then.
[54:19.550 --> 54:25.010]  So I need to... Were there any pills in that bottle still? I wish. I'd love to find a little
[54:25.010 --> 54:31.670]  extra collectible. No, there wasn't. I asked because I was watching a TikTok video the other
[54:31.670 --> 54:36.410]  day about coin collecting. I mean, the other day was probably three months ago, but I was surprised
[54:36.410 --> 54:41.010]  to find out that the guy that was doing the video was saying you shouldn't clean them. Yeah, I assume.
[54:41.010 --> 54:45.910]  Because it can damage them. And it would seem counterintuitive to me. I think you'd want to
[54:45.910 --> 54:49.890]  polish them up and get them in like as good a shape as possible. But I guess that's not the
[54:49.890 --> 54:54.490]  thing to do. I feel like you see that in like antique roadshow things where like the person
[54:54.490 --> 54:58.450]  brings it on and is like, I cleaned it. And then the evaluator is just like, what are you doing?
[54:58.610 --> 55:03.850]  Why did you do that? You fuck this completely. Yeah, I don't plan on doing that. I just need to
[55:03.850 --> 55:07.550]  preserve them in a better way than what they're currently in. So I think that has helped me ease
[55:07.550 --> 55:13.950]  into 2023. So you're saying Geoff needs a new hobby? I think a new hobby would be good. I also
[55:13.950 --> 55:18.930]  would just like to know, Geoff, when you think 2023 has officially begun, whenever that is,
[55:18.950 --> 55:22.710]  it could be a month from now, it could be tomorrow, just when you feel like, you know what,
[55:22.750 --> 55:27.810]  we're here. Man, thanks, man. I really want to. I want to get in there. I really I want to have
[55:27.810 --> 55:34.250]  like that New Year energy. And I just don't. I even tried to like trick it into happening by
[55:34.250 --> 55:37.910]  going for a bike ride, because typically on the rare occasions that I kind of feel like this,
[55:37.950 --> 55:42.190]  or I'm having trouble like working stuff out, exercise always fixes it. So I went for a bike
[55:42.190 --> 55:53.030]  ride today. My fucking amazing, wonderful, state of the art Cadillac Porsche of e-bikes,
[55:53.570 --> 56:01.730]  the Trek Elant 99S that I have, tried to fucking kill me today. And I don't know if it's the bike,
[56:01.730 --> 56:08.530]  or if a ghost, or if somebody in my family is trying to assassinate me, or if it's one of y'all.
[56:09.150 --> 56:15.230]  But my bike, something happened to me on my bike ride today that I almost died. And I'm fine. No
[56:15.230 --> 56:21.630]  bruises, no nothing. But I was riding, I was riding my bike. I was going, you know, I tend to
[56:21.630 --> 56:29.530]  ride with no hands, right? Because it works out your core more. And I was going, I was going down
[56:29.530 --> 56:35.390]  a trail. I was going about 24 miles an hour, which is about how fast I go on my bike. Typically,
[56:35.490 --> 56:40.730]  it's about my average speed now. You didn't just do that to sort of stick it to me while I was
[56:40.730 --> 56:46.330]  struggling. You do that all the time, just like in public. Yeah, I actually went home today to
[56:46.330 --> 56:50.030]  put on a hoodie so that I could put my hands in my pockets while I rode because it was chilly.
[56:50.210 --> 56:57.210]  What are you doing? That's you talked up how these things are out. It might be a ghost.
[56:57.210 --> 57:04.950]  No, no, no. It might be us doing something and then launched into so I ride my bike with no
[57:04.950 --> 57:08.830]  hands. But you what are you talking know that about me? I ride my bike with my eyes closed.
[57:08.830 --> 57:11.890]  Sometimes we had a whole thing about that, too. Although I promised Emily I wouldn't do that
[57:11.890 --> 57:19.310]  anymore. That was like a year ago on the show. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You're right. Anyway. Anyway,
[57:19.590 --> 57:26.050]  so I'm doing my typical what I do about 18 miles into my bike ride and I'm riding with no hands
[57:26.050 --> 57:32.330]  and my front tire starts shaking violently. And so I like I barely I can barely get my hands out
[57:32.330 --> 57:38.550]  of my pockets. It's hard to grab a wheel and I pull over real fast and I'm like, what the fuck?
[57:38.630 --> 57:44.310]  I don't know what's going on my bike. And I get off of it and I look and your front tire has a
[57:44.310 --> 57:52.790]  has a quick release axle in it. So you can change tires quickly. And someone had or someone or
[57:52.790 --> 58:01.750]  some thing had loosened the quick release that like the quick release thing. So my it was just
[58:01.750 --> 58:07.030]  hanging on and my front tire was about to fly off of my bike. I don't know how it happened
[58:07.030 --> 58:11.610]  because it's cranked on hard. Somebody must have loosened it. And I don't it was either somebody
[58:11.610 --> 58:17.230]  alive or somebody in the afterlife. But somebody loosened my quick release axle on my front tire
[58:17.230 --> 58:23.270]  and it almost I all I was like, I'm going to guess four seconds from from having my front
[58:23.270 --> 58:28.630]  tire fly off of my bike while I was going 24 miles an hour on a trail. With your hands in
[58:28.630 --> 58:33.690]  your pockets. With my hands in my pocket. Yeah, that would have been all face. Yeah, 100% face.
[58:34.590 --> 58:39.230]  Geoff's take on this current year makes a lot of sense now. This is a bad year for you.
[58:39.350 --> 58:44.490]  I don't want a bad year. I had a shitty year before. Every year since 2019 has been a dog turd
[58:44.490 --> 58:50.570]  year. I need 2023. Yeah, that had nothing to do with my hands on the handlebars. I still would
[58:50.570 --> 58:56.450]  have almost lost my front tire. I think it's not my hands in my pockets that caused the fucking
[58:56.450 --> 59:02.630]  the quick release valve to pop out. Geoff is a big pockets guy. I do like pockets. He's riding his
[59:02.630 --> 59:07.650]  bike. He's got his balls in a pocket. He's got his hands in a pocket. You're obsessed with pockets.
[59:07.890 --> 59:14.130]  Well, I made a wrist pocket. Clearly I'm obsessed with pockets. What if Unifar made a hoodie that
[59:14.130 --> 59:19.550]  had two fake arms that went on the handlebars so your real arms could be in the pocket? Now that's not a bad idea.
[59:20.130 --> 59:27.370]  Huh. That's an interesting idea. But what if you, what if Safer put the real arms on the thing,
[59:27.450 --> 59:34.770]  have fake arms in your pocket? How am I gonna keep my real arms warm? Because he's addicted
[59:34.770 --> 59:41.930]  to having his hands in his pocket. Just because he wants his actual hands in his pocket. Yeah, I understand
[59:41.930 --> 59:45.670]  that, but that's a terrible thing to do. So I'm saying like a way to break the habit
[59:45.670 --> 59:51.050]  of hands in the pocket. What I need. You made fake hands for your pockets. What about fake
[59:51.050 --> 59:58.930]  balls for your pockets? Well, that's, we'll get to that eventually. What I need, what I need is to
[59:58.930 --> 01:00:05.390]  solve the mystery of which one of you, or my daughter, or my fiance, or one of my neighbors,
[01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:11.290]  or some spirit, or ghost, or demon, which one of you out there is trying to kill me
[01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:15.470]  by loosening shit up on my bike so that it falls apart while I'm riding? I think it was time. I
[01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:20.650]  think it just, yeah, I like, I think it just loosened up and you would have noticed four
[01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:25.610]  miles earlier if you were holding on to the handlebars and went, this feels a little funny,
[01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:28.850]  let me get it. No, it wouldn't have started feeling funny until it like, until that moment.
[01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:33.570]  I'm telling you. Oh, I think it probably would have loosened up as time went, as you kept going,
[01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:40.430]  and then all of a sudden a ghost is trying to kill you. I'm with Geoff, let's be rational about this.
[01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:45.570]  Somebody did this to you. Gavin has motive, for sure, undeniable motive. I don't know who else
[01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:49.290]  does. I think I'm in the clear. I'm in a good place with Millie right now, so I don't think
[01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:53.590]  it would be her. Yeah, I think Gavin is number one suspect. Emily and I aren't married yet.
[01:00:55.150 --> 01:01:01.470]  Andrew immediately jumped on the, hang on, let me side with Geoff, also I'm absolved from this.
[01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:06.090]  Because that's why I jumped on, because I know I'm on the team, it's not me. No way, it's me.
[01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:12.610]  You know what, Andrew? Let's be rational about this. I've seen how far your tendrils reach.
[01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:18.850]  I've seen you godfather mastermind all kinds of events in Texas from the comfort of Vancouver
[01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:23.710]  Island, so I absolutely think you are capable of it. However, I think you and I are in a very good
[01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:28.090]  place right now, we're still riding the high of working together. So I absolve you of any guilt,
[01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:32.250]  but I definitely think you're capable of having orchestrated this. I'm not saying I'm not capable,
[01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:36.070]  I'm saying I'm not motivated. There's zero motivation, you and I are doing great,
[01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:40.130]  we just did a team thing, I'm not a suspect. Gavin is the one, I'd say, suspect number one.
[01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:45.990]  Because he didn't act against you, I think suspect number two, Jack, once again,
[01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:49.430]  put him back into the fold. He was playing a bike game, a motorbike game,
[01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:53.590]  couldn't be upset about that, I don't know. I wasn't there, that'd be for you to evaluate.
[01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:57.810]  I just, and the thing is too, it's like, I haven't ridden my bike in, you know,
[01:01:57.810 --> 01:02:03.310]  maybe three weeks or so? I've been kind of off of it. So, what do you guys, might have tried to
[01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:06.610]  kill me like a month ago, and this is just a delayed effect, I don't know. But I want you
[01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:10.410]  to know, I've got my sleuthing cap on, and as I've been texting you guys for a while,
[01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:14.510]  F***face needs to solve a mystery. I'm not saying this is the mystery, this might just be a Geoff
[01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:18.750]  mystery to solve, but, so, by the way, if you're aware of a mystery out there in the world that
[01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:22.490]  needs to be solved, please let F***face know, I really, really want to solve a mystery in 2023.
[01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:27.590]  But I'm going to get to the bottom of which one of you, who in my life, both alive or dead,
[01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:31.610]  is trying to murder me. Definitely wasn't me. Well, that's, of course you would say that. Do
[01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:36.430]  you think if you put your balls in only the pocket, but didn't put your legs through the boxes,
[01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:42.430]  you could hold the boxes up? Like it would... No, I don't think so. No, I don't think it works that
[01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:46.950]  way. Okay. I think you'd have to, you don't really have access to the pocket until your
[01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:51.730]  legs are through it. Have you tried one ball in, one ball out? Or you just tried different
[01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:56.330]  approaches to this? No, but I can't imagine that would be comfortable either. What I need to do,
[01:02:56.330 --> 01:03:02.130]  in my life, is to separate my right ball from my right thigh as much as humanly possible. And
[01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:06.750]  the pocket does that. That's, you know what, yeah, from the perspective of crotch rot and just
[01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:11.930]  wanting things away from your inner thigh, I support this. I understand this better now. As
[01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:19.850]  somebody who had jock itch for six months straight, it's a, let me tell you, it's a problem to solve.
[01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:24.330]  Not pocket based. I got a blanket for Christmas. I'm thinking of becoming a blanket guy.
[01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:30.070]  I'm thinking of like shifting. Does anyone here big blanket guy? I kind of want to get like nine
[01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:36.810]  blankets. I think having four cats has got me away from that. They're always just caked in hair.
[01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:41.270]  That's fair. Yeah. I guess having is Sam does not, she lives her own life,
[01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:45.990]  sleeping on the couch. She does not want to be anywhere near a bed. It's too tall for her at
[01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:51.790]  this point. But I was just, I happen to have three blankets in bed plus the sheet. I realized the
[01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:56.530]  other night that I was under four different blankets, but different parts of me were under
[01:03:56.530 --> 01:04:00.950]  different blankets. I think that could be, that might be a lifestyle I want to get into.
[01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:06.250]  So you're, you're, you're split across multiple layers of blankets, different limbs and how far
[01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:10.890]  up the eight pillows are you at this point? The pillow mountain had fallen at this,
[01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:15.110]  at this current moment. I was pretty low to the bed. A lot of, you know, the bed slides from the
[01:04:15.110 --> 01:04:18.730]  wall, then pillows fall down the hole. Oh, you hadn't reached your reset yet.
[01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:22.590]  So you probably hadn't reached my reset. Yeah. The, the mountain still hasn't been up. And I,
[01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:28.610]  honestly, I might trade away some pillows for more blankets. If I could have like 10 different
[01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:34.190]  size blankets on the bed at all times and all corners of it, I think that would be pretty great.
[01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:38.830]  So is it like a central heating system? Like to cool down, you move up the blankets until
[01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:42.790]  they're less on you? Yeah. You can move, you can put a foot out, you know, like you could
[01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:47.330]  have different arm, different blanket, different layer of it. Maybe one's under three blankets.
[01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:52.450]  Maybe my right leg's under four blankets. My left leg's under one. Now, is it, is it, is it just the
[01:04:52.450 --> 01:04:57.790]  ability, the variability that you like the control or is it, do you like the weight of more blankets
[01:04:57.790 --> 01:05:02.470]  on top of you? Because it's not the weight. Yeah. So it's just the control and it's just like
[01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:06.690]  comfort everywhere. No matter where I turn, being able to grab a blanket. They also are
[01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:11.890]  great for pillows. You can fold them up in a ball that can sometimes help rebuild pillow mountain
[01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:16.810]  if it falls during the night. So I'm just, I'm considering being a big pillow or a blanket guy.
[01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:20.390]  I'm already a pillow guy. You should look into weighted blankets to see how you feel about those.
[01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:24.950]  Emily. Yeah, I'm worried about. Emily got one for Christmas and it eliminated her need for me.
[01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:32.150]  Oh, fuck. Maybe she is trying to kill me. She got, she got a weighted blanket and then my dumb ass
[01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:36.970]  bought her this pillow system that she wanted because her shoulder hurts and it's like complicated
[01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:43.330]  and, but it comes with a giant like wraparound snake pillow that you can kind of hug and like
[01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:48.030]  wrap around your entire body. And now she has this cocooning period when she gets into bed
[01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:52.290]  where she wraps herself around this and then puts the weighted blanket on and it's like she
[01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:59.070]  disappears and I'm, and then she's just gone and she has no need for me at all anymore. Uh, yeah,
[01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:05.170]  Eric said I'm done. I think, fuck, it must be Emily's trying to kill me. That sounds fantastic.
[01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:10.430]  What? Emily trying to kill me? No, no, the pillow system. No, I can't even touch her in there. Like
[01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:17.130]  I can't get to her. She's, there's like, it's so complicated. I, what I'm imagining can't be what
[01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:21.630]  it looks like. I bet it is. You remember that scene in It's Always Sunny where Danny DeVito
[01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:27.170]  gets stuck in like that part, that spiral like circled part toy thing? Yeah. That's what I'm
[01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:31.290]  imagining is like a pillow that you just like wrap yourself around one of those. Kind of, but bigger
[01:06:31.290 --> 01:06:37.090]  and softer. That sounds great. You gotta send me this pillow system. It's fucking ridiculous.
[01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:45.010]  Seems like 2023 is the year of new systems. Yeah. New pockets, new systems. Taking L's,
[01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:49.930]  new systems. And we're gonna, and we're gonna revolutionize the summer Yule log.
[01:06:51.690 --> 01:06:55.930]  We got five months to come up with it. Hey, uh, Eric said we should start wrapping up and that's
[01:06:55.930 --> 01:07:01.810]  correct. Uh, but I do want to ask one last thing. Uh, I was thinking, you know, in my process, my,
[01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:08.250]  my year end review that I was doing, uh, I was thinking about what I had the most fun doing with
[01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:16.010]  y'all and definitely up there, definitely up there were the Tuxedo and MVP2. And so I would like to
[01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:22.290]  get a new movie on the books if there's a new movie for us to even do. I know we've talked about
[01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:25.890]  a bunch. I don't want to force it if we haven't found the right movie yet, but I would like to
[01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:29.070]  start thinking in those terms because I really, really enjoy doing those movies with you guys.
[01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:33.670]  We talked about Monkey March as an option. I also, I think it would be great to pick a movie
[01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:38.870]  because we get, we did one from Gavin's childhood, one from mine. I feel like to really round out
[01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:46.190]  almost like a trilogy of watchalongs, something from your childhood could be good. Oh, you got
[01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:51.590]  anything that's both? You got a monkey movie from your childhood? A monkey childhood movie.
[01:07:53.610 --> 01:08:02.190]  Oh, oh, I think we've gone into 2023. Let me, I think it's here. Let me, let me, all right. I just,
[01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:08.170]  two movies jumped to mind. Two, uh, yeah, two movies just jumped to mind.
[01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:12.110]  Uh, so let me know what you think. Uh, there was a movie that I remember
[01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:17.970]  from my childhood called Super Fuzz. That sounds great. About a cop who gets super powers.
[01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:24.870]  Uh, let me see if I can find it. I thought that was going to be a monkey movie. No, I don't think
[01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:29.190]  I have any monkey movies unless you want. Okay, here we go. So there's, yeah, the fuzz could
[01:08:29.190 --> 01:08:34.870]  have been either. Yeah, I thought it was an animal fuzz, not a police officer. Movies from my childhood
[01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:38.550]  that I remember loving, that I barely remember. See, Super Fuzz would be like a horror movie now.
[01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:41.830]  So that's my only, and I think it's, yeah, Ernest Bognine's in it. And I think it's
[01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:49.110]  kind of maybe like a TNA movie a little bit. Uh, or. Is Ernest Bognine the guy? The Super Fuzz guy?
[01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:54.790]  No, he's just like his buddy. His cop buddy. Uh, have you guys ever seen a movie called Condor Man?
[01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:59.570]  No. Oh yeah, there's another one from when I was a kid that I fucking, here, hold on a second.
[01:08:59.910 --> 01:09:03.970]  The only thing I've seen Ernest Bognine do is choke to death on a hot dog.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:13.120]  Here are two movies from my childhood that I remember fucking loving. Condor Man.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:21.040]  I'm, I'm, I'm into Condor Man. Condor Man seems great. I saw Condor Man in the theaters. It came
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:27.580]  out in 1981, so I was six years old. And it was, they had a, it had a Baskin Robbins tie-in. There
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:32.180]  was a flavor called Condor Man Crunch. And I remember that because they advertised it at the
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:35.580]  movie. And then right after the movie was over, I got, I convinced my mom to take me to Baskin
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:41.500]  Robbins so I could eat Condor Man Crunch, which I think might've just been Rocky Road, but it
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:47.080]  tasted. No, fuck, he found it! Holy shit! It does exist! Yeah! Condor Man Crunch!
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:51.740]  Chocolate ice cream with crunchy praline pecan bits and a milk chocolate ribbon.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:56.860]  He looks like a human popcorn. I think we got our movie. Also, this is a Disney movie?
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.260]  It is a Disney movie. Yeah. Disney's Condor Man?
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:05.680]  Yeah. It doesn't look like on the Condor Man Crunch that it's going very well for him.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.200]  No. Is it, is it a guy with handlebars?
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:17.540]  Yeah. I don't remember a ton about this movie, just that I loved it when I was a kid.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:20.220]  Notice how he's got both hands on the handlebars though.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.600]  All right, well, I'm going to submit, I'm going to submit Condor Man or Super Fuzz as
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.500]  potential new movies. And then I'll think about it a little bit more, but those,
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:32.920]  those just immediately leapt to mind. Those are great choices, Geoff. Thank you very much.
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:37.580]  I'm excited. How does he get the jacket on under the wings?
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:41.400]  Gavin, all will be revealed when we watch Condor Man.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:41.920]  Okay.
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:46.020]  Don't try to dissect the Condor Man. Simply allow him to be.
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:49.880]  Is that a bow? Is he hiding a bow with his wings?
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:51.600]  Oh, it's on a weapon he uses?
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.980]  It's on Apple TV. It's, oh yeah, it's on Amazon Prime Video.
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:54.880]  I think that's the one.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:55.500]  Yeah.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.720]  It seems like a good pick.
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:01.100]  All right. I mean, I'll see when we can get Condor Man on the voice.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:06.700]  Here's what'll be fun too. I remember, here's what I remember about Condor Man.
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:11.360]  I remember that suit. I remember him being kind of like a fuck-up.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:15.980]  And I remember Condor Man Crunch. And that's it. I have no other memory.
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:20.120]  I remember him being a fuck-up. Oh, you don't say. No way.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.700]  I remember more about the ice cream than I did the movie.
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:30.240]  Where would you say, would Condor Man Crunch, did you like it? Did you not like it?
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:31.960]  Where did it rank amongst ice cream?
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.920]  I was a kid eating the flavor of ice cream from the movie I just saw.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:41.100]  So I'm pretty sure at that point in time, that was the greatest thing I'd ever put in my mouth.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.260]  I wonder if there's any Condor Man Crunch somewhere.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.920]  There has to be. I was going to look that up as soon as we finished.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:55.560]  Like it's common for people to find, you know, like 28 year old Pepsi, like crystal Pepsi.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.780]  But this is ice cream. It's like, you're going to have to have it frozen for all that time.
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.900]  So this is my idea. This is my thought based off what we said.
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:06.360]  And Geoff, if this isn't what you're into, because this would be very much a you idea.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.620]  We have made pizzas before.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.280]  I think we need to attempt to recreate the flavor of Condor Man Crunch.
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:15.820]  I think we have to make an ice cream that is copying.
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:19.340]  And you can evaluate if this is what you remember it tasting like.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:24.260]  I love this ice cream. I love it.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.020]  Love it. I'm right there with Eric.
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.360]  Here's what I say we got to do, too.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.940]  We have to make the ice cream.
[01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.080]  Like we have to get like an old timey ice cream maker like my grandpa had,
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:35.080]  where you put rock salt and milk and shit in.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.060]  And then you turn the handle for an hour and a half.
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.200]  Yeah, we're going to do it like fucking old school style.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.760]  Like how they had to make ice cream in 1981 when this dipshit movie came out.
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:45.060]  Oh my God, I love it.
[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:47.580]  I might be in 2023.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.400]  I think I might be in 2023.
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.160]  You guys pulled me into 2023.
[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:53.600]  Fuck 2022.
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:55.340]  Hello 2023.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.700]  Thanks for listening to another episode.
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:00.480]  The first episode of F*** Face recorded in 2023.
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:02.540]  It's going to be an awesome year.
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:03.860]  Condor man out.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.400]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:12.540]  The boys recap the Falls draft.
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:14.320]  We're silver medal friends.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.240]  Who would you sit next to on a plane?
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.680]  When is the balaclava hitting the store?
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.500]  Patton is decent in trials.
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:22.320]  Geoff needs to remove some stumps.
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:25.220]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:28.420]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
