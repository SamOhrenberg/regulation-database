[00:15.550 --> 00:18.070]  Okay, this is episode 139. You can begin whenever you like.
[00:18.310 --> 00:23.730]  That was a great intro by Eric. I believe we did label him the official intro-er earlier.
[00:25.730 --> 00:28.410]  At the tail end of last year or earlier this year? I'm not sure when.
[00:28.610 --> 00:35.010]  Anyway, so there you have it. That was Eric. He mentioned this is episode 139 of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:35.490 --> 00:39.090]  My name is Geoff, with me as always, Andrew and Gavin.
[00:40.030 --> 00:43.050]  This is our first recording in a couple weeks. We didn't record last week
[00:43.050 --> 00:45.590]  because, well, Eric and I went on vacation together.
[00:45.830 --> 00:52.450]  And boy, do I have a video and some thoughts on that to share with you guys today.
[00:53.710 --> 00:57.910]  As a matter of fact, I have so much. I was compiling my notes today before I came over.
[00:57.970 --> 01:01.790]  I have 22 things listed to talk about today. That's what I whittled it down to.
[01:01.790 --> 01:05.190]  Is that what happens when you hang out with the cast in real life?
[01:05.190 --> 01:06.770]  It's not all Eric. A lot of it's other stuff.
[01:06.890 --> 01:10.330]  I imagine that we won't... I won't get to like 19 of the 22 things
[01:10.330 --> 01:13.170]  because I assume you guys have shit you want to talk about as well.
[01:13.410 --> 01:16.270]  And this is a podcast for all of us.
[01:16.850 --> 01:20.010]  It is. The triangle, right? Isn't that what we established?
[01:20.050 --> 01:21.290]  That's right. The comedy triangle is what we determined.
[01:21.310 --> 01:22.890]  The comedy triangle. Going back.
[01:23.230 --> 01:25.170]  I feel like I wronged Andrew yesterday.
[01:25.690 --> 01:26.130]  Ooh!
[01:26.690 --> 01:27.770]  Are you feeling wronged?
[01:28.230 --> 01:31.170]  You know, it's funny. I didn't want to... I wasn't going to bring this up,
[01:31.490 --> 01:38.150]  but I did ask a hypothetical to both Geoff and Eric before the show started to see where they fell on it.
[01:39.430 --> 01:41.050]  I didn't realize that was Gavin.
[01:41.650 --> 01:43.570]  It was Gavin. It was absolutely Gavin.
[01:43.650 --> 01:45.030]  That might have affected my answer.
[01:47.090 --> 01:49.330]  I asked Geoff and Eric before...
[01:49.330 --> 01:51.150]  You know, pleasantries, Gavin, that you're never there for.
[01:51.230 --> 01:52.650]  And I expected you not to be there.
[01:52.930 --> 01:58.610]  Much like I should have expected you not to show up last night when I organized...
[01:58.610 --> 02:02.650]  Gavin and I were talking about... because we were doing trials like recently, right?
[02:02.670 --> 02:04.390]  He beat the time. We did that little bet.
[02:04.390 --> 02:12.290]  And then in our off period, I decided to try to beat every time Gavin and Jack have in all the trials games.
[02:13.210 --> 02:15.930]  So I've been doing that, and he sent me a photo of...
[02:15.930 --> 02:19.870]  Gavin used to do a thing called Trials Tuesday, where I think you'd get together with your friends
[02:19.870 --> 02:22.830]  and like four or five TVs would play trials.
[02:23.210 --> 02:27.110]  And I asked Gavin, do you have any more like weekly days that you do?
[02:27.210 --> 02:30.350]  Like a fun, oh, this is... like I have a movie Monday type thing.
[02:30.370 --> 02:33.070]  And he said no, and that makes me sad.
[02:33.070 --> 02:36.710]  So I thought, you know what? My friend Gavin, he doesn't have a day for anything.
[02:36.870 --> 02:39.330]  It's Wednesday. We've recently been playing Warzone.
[02:39.710 --> 02:42.770]  So I just texted him, feels like a Warzone Wednesday to me.
[02:43.350 --> 02:44.590]  And he said, absolutely.
[02:45.170 --> 02:48.950]  And the sucky thing about that is you text me that at like noon.
[02:49.330 --> 02:50.330]  It might have been even earlier.
[02:50.510 --> 02:54.690]  And I just spent the rest of the afternoon just so excited for Warzone Wednesday.
[02:55.070 --> 02:59.330]  I was like, oh man, I'm not usually one who looks forward to the evenings,
[02:59.330 --> 03:02.210]  but I was like, oh, I can't wait for later. It's gonna be brilliant.
[03:02.210 --> 03:06.030]  Well, you say that you said, absolutely. What do you want to do it?
[03:06.410 --> 03:08.250]  I said, what about this time?
[03:08.810 --> 03:13.550]  No reply, which is not completely unusual for you with game stuff.
[03:13.670 --> 03:14.750]  I interpret that as a yes.
[03:15.110 --> 03:18.930]  Sometimes I've written in my phone an answer and not hit send when I thought I did.
[03:19.210 --> 03:22.210]  I thought it was reasonable for you to be there.
[03:22.350 --> 03:23.550]  I waited about...
[03:23.550 --> 03:25.990]  I said, I said, what time do we start?
[03:26.030 --> 03:27.710]  And then you immediately replied with the time.
[03:27.710 --> 03:28.710]  I gave you time.
[03:29.130 --> 03:32.010]  And I asked you a question. I was like, does this work for you?
[03:32.690 --> 03:34.610]  You never got back to it. That's fine.
[03:35.490 --> 03:38.410]  You've never missed, never missed a gaming thing that we've said.
[03:38.590 --> 03:41.150]  Once there was a time and place, you've always been there.
[03:41.710 --> 03:42.730]  So I assumed you would be.
[03:43.410 --> 03:44.910]  Waited about 20 minutes.
[03:46.170 --> 03:48.190]  Texted to ask if we're rescheduling.
[03:49.010 --> 03:49.690]  You said, oh, fuck.
[03:50.490 --> 03:53.090]  What about later in the evening? I didn't feel like playing later.
[03:53.210 --> 03:54.630]  We're probably gonna play for like an hour.
[03:54.970 --> 03:56.670]  I just didn't have it in me. I was tired.
[03:56.670 --> 03:59.130]  So we've rescheduled to today.
[03:59.290 --> 04:02.550]  But what I was asking Geoff and Eric was, were you late for that?
[04:02.830 --> 04:07.510]  Because I asked you a time and you never responded to that request.
[04:07.870 --> 04:09.350]  It was a question.
[04:09.650 --> 04:12.430]  And since you didn't lock in, I wasn't sure if you were late or not.
[04:12.470 --> 04:14.710]  Or if it just technically wasn't scheduled.
[04:15.450 --> 04:20.670]  I've done a dumb thing, which I thought was an amazing hack.
[04:21.770 --> 04:23.510]  I did this about a year ago.
[04:23.510 --> 04:31.850]  I made a shortcut on my iPhone that puts my phone into Do Not Disturb anytime it's on charge.
[04:32.470 --> 04:35.150]  And I figured that way I don't have to manually set it for a time.
[04:36.030 --> 04:41.090]  Anytime it's getting juice, I assume it's in the night and I'm charging and I don't want anything.
[04:41.610 --> 04:43.630]  But yeah, I forgot to charge my phone the night before.
[04:43.870 --> 04:52.210]  And I was doing a midday charge, which had the interesting side effect of basically silencing my phone and my watch and everything.
[04:52.770 --> 04:54.570]  For the entire day.
[04:56.450 --> 04:57.770]  So it's a flawed system.
[04:58.190 --> 05:00.230]  And then when you were like, reschedule?
[05:00.710 --> 05:05.570]  I was like, oh shit, I missed a time. I just forgot.
[05:06.190 --> 05:07.590]  You did, but I didn't know.
[05:07.630 --> 05:11.390]  I didn't know what time I was being late for and I'd already been late for it.
[05:11.970 --> 05:17.430]  But you weren't. According to Geoff and Eric, you were clear. You were not late. It was never finalized.
[05:17.650 --> 05:20.990]  Geoff and Eric, would you like to change your answer based on the knowledge that it is me?
[05:21.490 --> 05:27.250]  Would I like to change my answer? 100%. Do I think I can? Morally, no.
[05:28.050 --> 05:30.850]  I still think you're not late, unfortunately.
[05:31.170 --> 05:36.330]  If it were anybody who were late in this scenario, I would like it to be put on the record that it should be you.
[05:36.950 --> 05:38.910]  But no, I think you're in the clear here, man.
[05:39.230 --> 05:43.930]  Yeah, I mean, knowing it's you, I still wouldn't change my answer.
[05:44.070 --> 05:48.790]  I just don't think that you're absolved of all responsibility in that situation. You never said yes.
[05:48.790 --> 05:55.930]  I do find it fucking weird. I've known you for more than half your life now. I've known you probably 20 years, Gavin, or close to it.
[05:58.390 --> 06:09.490]  And you're worse at communicating and being on time and making shit and general correspondence than you've ever been in your life.
[06:09.570 --> 06:16.910]  And you are in a house of technological wonders. You have a goddamn clock you built just to show up at this podcast on time.
[06:16.910 --> 06:24.810]  You have 700,000 phones and devices to notify you things. And somehow you're at an all-time low.
[06:24.990 --> 06:28.750]  I do think you might want to take a step back and evaluate what you're doing wrong.
[06:29.130 --> 06:32.790]  Well, it's interesting coming from the person I texted yesterday who didn't reply to me.
[06:33.590 --> 06:35.110]  Did you text me yesterday?
[06:36.470 --> 06:40.550]  Hold on. I'm not the one on trial here, but let me see.
[06:40.550 --> 06:49.050]  Oh, oh, oh. You texted me last night at 8.43pm. I was in the movies when I received the text.
[06:49.610 --> 06:54.130]  And then after the movie was over, I just went straight to bed. So I haven't even had a chance to watch it yet. I'm sorry.
[06:55.350 --> 06:56.630]  I saw M3an.
[06:58.490 --> 06:58.870]  M3an?
[06:59.430 --> 07:00.870]  Oh, how was M3an?
[07:00.930 --> 07:02.170]  It was really funny. It was really good.
[07:02.470 --> 07:08.730]  What do you think is the best entertainment product with a number in the name? Like, do you think Driftria is a good game?
[07:09.470 --> 07:11.090]  I see what you're saying.
[07:14.390 --> 07:15.930]  What are some good ones?
[07:16.690 --> 07:17.990]  Was there like a scrithrium?
[07:20.050 --> 07:28.630]  I think the third one, and then I think maybe the fourth one also, and then I think probably the fifth one. I think they all probably had numbers in them.
[07:32.990 --> 07:41.410]  And it has to be a number replacing a letter, right? So it can't be like a Too Fast Too Furious where they use the number on both.
[07:42.050 --> 07:42.810]  Instead of like the two.
[07:44.590 --> 07:45.810]  I'll have to think about that.
[07:49.070 --> 07:59.530]  Kind of like a Falls poll, we're pulling from all the movies and properties ever made. They don't all come to mind so quickly.
[08:00.730 --> 08:04.930]  That was probably the most confusing thing Andrew's ever presented.
[08:04.950 --> 08:05.610]  That's not at all.
[08:05.610 --> 08:12.830]  Because not only did I not understand what you wanted and the way you described it, I still have problems with.
[08:13.110 --> 08:20.570]  But even in the discussion in person on office day, I couldn't even figure out who was arguing for what and who was mad at who.
[08:20.710 --> 08:24.490]  Like I sat there for that whole thing after I came in because I came in late to that recording.
[08:24.490 --> 08:27.630]  I couldn't figure out who was on my side at all.
[08:28.610 --> 08:30.170]  I've never been more confused.
[08:30.350 --> 08:36.930]  It was interesting to see the different sections of listeners and comment leavers having differing opinions.
[08:37.550 --> 08:39.050]  Like where things were slanted more.
[08:39.470 --> 08:44.170]  Like I'd say on our Reddit, there were more people vocal that I was in the right for that system.
[08:44.430 --> 08:50.930]  On YouTube, I'd say it was definitely majority you guys, Eric and Geoff.
[08:50.930 --> 08:57.370]  And then the site was, I'd say like probably 60-40 for me, for you guys, actually.
[08:57.510 --> 09:01.410]  But you could have made it so simple just by saying, we'll pick four of our favorite fours.
[09:01.750 --> 09:04.650]  Well, yeah, that was the whole point. I don't understand.
[09:04.810 --> 09:07.430]  Why would you draft something that isn't...
[09:07.430 --> 09:10.750]  Why didn't you call it the great face condiment draft?
[09:11.010 --> 09:11.750]  What do you mean by that?
[09:13.010 --> 09:15.930]  Well, we were trying to come up with the best thing, pick the best thing.
[09:16.030 --> 09:16.850]  Why not just call it that?
[09:17.610 --> 09:22.110]  I don't understand what condiments has to do with what we're talking about.
[09:22.590 --> 09:26.210]  Well, you didn't call it the condiment draft. You just, we picked our favorite condiments.
[09:26.710 --> 09:28.350]  When did we do a condiment draft?
[09:31.110 --> 09:32.430]  What are we talking about?
[09:32.930 --> 09:37.110]  I actually remember I listened to it recently. It was episode 63, I believe.
[09:37.610 --> 09:38.870]  Oh, we did a condiment draft?
[09:39.190 --> 09:41.270]  No, we did. We made our own condiments.
[09:41.690 --> 09:45.070]  No, we just picked the best condiment. We made it.
[09:45.270 --> 09:45.630]  Okay.
[09:45.630 --> 09:51.350]  But we didn't, you didn't call it drafting our condiments or drafting different condiments into the same bowl.
[09:51.750 --> 09:54.650]  We just, I don't know why you phrased it as a draft is what I'm saying.
[09:54.730 --> 09:57.610]  Because, well, we couldn't, we're not going to make the same condiment.
[09:57.970 --> 09:59.390]  We couldn't make the same pick.
[10:00.070 --> 10:00.830]  Is this...
[10:00.830 --> 10:01.630]  You can't have two people...
[10:01.630 --> 10:03.150]  Making the same condiment.
[10:03.690 --> 10:05.730]  Because we're not naturally going to make the same condiment.
[10:05.730 --> 10:08.370]  What if you also made shrimp cocktail sauce?
[10:08.390 --> 10:12.890]  That was also your idea. I don't know, I don't understand why you're coming at me with the labeling of your project.
[10:13.610 --> 10:14.630]  That was your thing.
[10:14.630 --> 10:18.390]  I'm just saying, picking our favorite things from all over the world...
[10:18.390 --> 10:19.530]  Are you asking me...
[10:19.530 --> 10:21.210]  No, wait, wait, time out.
[10:21.450 --> 10:22.170]  No, time out, Gavin.
[10:22.350 --> 10:28.930]  Are you asking me why I didn't name the idea you came up with the condiment draft?
[10:29.090 --> 10:29.290]  Yeah.
[10:29.350 --> 10:30.350]  Is that what, okay.
[10:30.690 --> 10:32.790]  Because I didn't fucking name it because it wasn't my thing.
[10:33.870 --> 10:34.970]  You're saying you would have.
[10:35.510 --> 10:36.850]  I don't think I would have.
[10:36.870 --> 10:38.950]  I don't think I would have ever thought of condiment draft.
[10:39.510 --> 10:41.970]  The draft, a draft is a simple thing.
[10:41.970 --> 10:46.270]  You have a list, we have a pool of falls, and you pick the falls.
[10:46.770 --> 10:50.830]  And to be honest, I was trying to be ambiguous because I wasn't sure if I wanted skyfall.
[10:50.970 --> 10:54.530]  I didn't want to narrow it down because I wanted some bullshit possibly.
[10:55.510 --> 10:57.030]  That's why it's a draft.
[10:57.290 --> 10:57.790]  I don't...
[10:57.790 --> 11:05.850]  I did not see continued arguing on the rules of the draft being on the fucking bingo card today.
[11:06.950 --> 11:10.790]  I will say though, this is a great opportunity I wanted to bring up.
[11:10.790 --> 11:12.550]  I've been talking about it with Eric all weekend on vacation.
[11:12.830 --> 11:15.390]  I think we should really do another draft.
[11:16.130 --> 11:17.510]  We definitely should do another draft.
[11:17.530 --> 11:21.010]  We should do it exactly the same way with Andrew, same fucking rules.
[11:22.510 --> 11:28.650]  My recommendation was we do it in March for March Madness and we just do like basketball-related fails or something.
[11:29.590 --> 11:33.150]  But I think this is too good not to do over and over again.
[11:33.250 --> 11:35.510]  Well, I think the whole thing was phenomenal.
[11:35.950 --> 11:36.670]  I don't get the pools.
[11:36.810 --> 11:37.710]  I get the pools.
[11:37.710 --> 11:38.670]  But I don't...
[11:38.670 --> 11:39.510]  Why would we...
[11:39.510 --> 11:41.030]  Why would we submit...
[11:41.030 --> 11:43.010]  Why would we go through that process twice?
[11:43.830 --> 11:51.110]  Why don't you guys do your own fucking research and don't rely on me bringing in some high-quality falls that you're gonna steal from me once we do the pool?
[11:51.190 --> 11:52.110]  We all brought falls.
[11:52.310 --> 11:52.670]  What do you mean?
[11:52.710 --> 11:54.350]  I'm saying, but if we did the pool idea, right?
[11:54.590 --> 11:55.530]  Like the original...
[11:55.530 --> 11:59.950]  The thought that Eric and Geoff wanted where we all share a pool of falls.
[12:01.310 --> 12:01.930]  It's Gavin's fault.
[12:02.310 --> 12:05.850]  I'm ready to pivot to something that's actually confusing, which is the signal awards.
[12:05.850 --> 12:09.150]  You're saying that what I wanted...
[12:09.150 --> 12:10.390]  It's not what I wanted.
[12:10.570 --> 12:12.190]  It's what a draft is.
[12:12.410 --> 12:13.470]  That's just incorrect.
[12:13.910 --> 12:14.930]  That's a false statement.
[12:15.330 --> 12:16.110]  But that's fine.
[12:16.630 --> 12:17.470]  Agree to disagree.
[12:18.450 --> 12:20.210]  I think the audience liked it overall.
[12:21.070 --> 12:25.930]  I saw a lot of definitely a lot of mad people that the videos weren't in our video.
[12:26.510 --> 12:28.770]  But I mean, those are just other people's videos, right?
[12:28.830 --> 12:29.370]  That's what we recommend.
[12:29.730 --> 12:30.810]  Yeah, 100%.
[12:30.810 --> 12:31.590]  We don't own any of that.
[12:31.590 --> 12:32.730]  Then we're just gonna get the fucking...
[12:32.730 --> 12:35.190]  We would get our falls draft taken down in eight seconds.
[12:35.190 --> 12:35.770]  Yeah.
[12:36.070 --> 12:37.390]  Yeah, that makes total sense to me.
[12:37.450 --> 12:41.110]  It doesn't make total sense to the audience for some reason, but...
[12:41.110 --> 12:47.630]  I can understand it not making sense to people who haven't dealt with YouTube's copyright strike system.
[12:47.890 --> 12:49.850]  But yeah, I mean, it's not easy to do that.
[12:49.870 --> 12:56.270]  As Nick correctly pointed out, it's for the same reason we can't play MVP 2 with you or we can't upload that movie.
[12:56.670 --> 13:02.930]  Just as a counter, as someone who doesn't understand the YouTube copyright strike system and apparently doesn't even understand what a draft is.
[13:03.530 --> 13:06.670]  The grape lady didn't upload the grape lady falling.
[13:06.910 --> 13:08.990]  Like, that's not their content, right?
[13:09.110 --> 13:09.850]  Like, isn't that weird?
[13:10.010 --> 13:13.810]  Like, how we're stealing from somebody who took video from somewhere else.
[13:13.830 --> 13:14.850]  But it is uploaded.
[13:15.430 --> 13:23.510]  And what we would be doing is putting 20 already uploaded videos into one video and then going,
[13:23.810 --> 13:26.590]  Hey, I fucking dare you to take this down.
[13:26.950 --> 13:31.690]  But is that a process that requires one person to click one button?
[13:31.690 --> 13:34.510]  And then no verification to go about it.
[13:34.710 --> 13:40.490]  And then also puts the whole channel at risk to be in a bad standing on YouTube.
[13:40.890 --> 13:46.310]  So really, I'm just not going to take advice from the audience in general, especially about this.
[13:46.670 --> 13:50.770]  You could argue that it's derivative enough or fair use enough for us to actually be able to do that.
[13:50.770 --> 13:51.450]  That's what I was going to say.
[13:51.550 --> 13:56.630]  It's just the systems in place to protect us from that are absolute dog shit.
[13:57.110 --> 13:58.690]  And that's absolutely true.
[13:58.690 --> 14:03.910]  But it's also the thing where people go, well, you can play 14 seconds of a song before you get it taken down.
[14:04.210 --> 14:05.390]  That's not a real thing.
[14:05.510 --> 14:07.050]  That's just the thing people made up.
[14:07.330 --> 14:10.270]  That's like going, well, if the teacher's 15 minutes late, you can leave.
[14:10.470 --> 14:11.330]  That's not real.
[14:11.770 --> 14:13.790]  Eric went on a rant about that on vacation, actually.
[14:13.890 --> 14:14.470]  It was pretty funny.
[14:14.790 --> 14:16.730]  Is that like the five second rule?
[14:16.910 --> 14:18.210]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[14:20.870 --> 14:23.510]  Yeah, there's probably a case that we could upload those videos.
[14:23.950 --> 14:28.210]  But it would get taken down and then we'd have to fight it and get it put back up.
[14:28.210 --> 14:30.070]  And then one of the other people would get it taken down.
[14:30.490 --> 14:34.110]  It's just like, we've all been down this road enough times.
[14:34.370 --> 14:40.070]  There was about a fucking 10 year period where I had nightmares every night about copyright strikes on YouTube for Achievement Hunter.
[14:40.690 --> 14:41.910]  It's not worth it.
[14:42.430 --> 14:43.570]  At the end of the day.
[14:43.670 --> 14:45.050]  You get copyright strikes and you're fucked.
[14:45.390 --> 14:47.330]  I mean, you're kind of screwed after one.
[14:47.650 --> 14:50.250]  You get a lot of your features disabled, even if your channel's still there.
[14:50.410 --> 14:53.030]  And then you get a petition to get it back, and it's a fucking nightmare.
[14:53.230 --> 14:55.210]  What if we just went to somewhere we didn't care about?
[14:55.350 --> 14:56.110]  Like Dangling Motion?
[14:56.110 --> 15:02.930]  What if we did video only on Daily Motion and just dared people to both find it and then report it?
[15:03.030 --> 15:10.290]  So your idea is to still steal the content, but just put it somewhere else?
[15:10.470 --> 15:11.430]  I don't think it's stolen.
[15:11.850 --> 15:13.650]  I don't think that's stolen content.
[15:14.110 --> 15:21.630]  You think it's okay to steal the content as long as you put it in a place that nobody is going to be able to find it?
[15:21.830 --> 15:24.470]  Well, I think the Grape Lady video was already stolen.
[15:24.470 --> 15:26.370]  So first of all, I don't feel like I'm stealing.
[15:26.510 --> 15:28.570]  The TikToks, that's where it gets weird.
[15:28.710 --> 15:32.350]  Where if the follower uploaded it, then...
[15:32.350 --> 15:33.750]  It's worse than that.
[15:33.930 --> 15:38.590]  So then, first off, the news channel of the Grape Lady video could strike us if they wanted to, easily.
[15:39.450 --> 15:47.730]  But what happens more often than not with these clips is there are companies that buy viral clips in the droves.
[15:47.890 --> 15:49.290]  Kind of like old stock photo companies.
[15:50.550 --> 15:52.870]  And I think one's called Jazz.
[15:52.870 --> 15:56.410]  But they go and they buy these videos for 75 bucks a piece.
[15:56.490 --> 16:01.070]  So they could very quite possibly own a lot of those videos.
[16:01.070 --> 16:03.910]  Just because the person who uploaded it, uploaded it, it was funny.
[16:04.010 --> 16:05.730]  And then somebody offered them 350 bucks for it.
[16:06.090 --> 16:07.190]  And they signed away the rights to it.
[16:07.470 --> 16:10.050]  I wouldn't be surprised if most of those videos are owned by a company like that.
[16:10.990 --> 16:12.410]  That's interesting. I didn't know that.
[16:12.670 --> 16:13.350]  There's a whole economy.
[16:13.530 --> 16:18.430]  I just think if YankeeFan22VT is brave enough, there's a way.
[16:18.650 --> 16:20.290]  There's a way for us to figure it out.
[16:20.910 --> 16:21.690]  Geoff, I have a question.
[16:22.370 --> 16:23.050]  Yeah, okay.
[16:23.290 --> 16:24.270]  What's Wheel of Duck?
[16:24.730 --> 16:25.630]  Oh, Wheel of Duck.
[16:26.030 --> 16:28.190]  Thank you. It's actually not Wheel of Duck. I wrote that wrong.
[16:28.250 --> 16:28.970]  It's Wheel of Suck.
[16:29.310 --> 16:30.030]  Let me write that down.
[16:30.210 --> 16:32.310]  I now have 23 things to talk about today.
[16:33.070 --> 16:34.910]  What do you want to talk about most on your list today?
[16:34.990 --> 16:35.710]  We'll get to it.
[16:35.790 --> 16:37.310]  We'll get to it six episodes from now.
[16:38.110 --> 16:42.750]  I think the most time sensitive stuff that I would like to talk about is the vacation with Eric.
[16:42.910 --> 16:44.690]  I learned a lot about Eric on this trip.
[16:45.170 --> 16:50.470]  I thought that this was the first time I've vacationed with a f*** facer in a very long time.
[16:51.490 --> 16:53.130]  First time I've ever vacationed with Eric.
[16:53.370 --> 16:54.330]  Couples vacation.
[16:54.510 --> 16:57.470]  We went to a beach resort in Cancun together.
[16:58.110 --> 17:00.570]  And I thought you guys might find it interesting.
[17:00.970 --> 17:04.450]  So I wrote down all the stuff that I found that was fascinating about Eric.
[17:04.610 --> 17:06.790]  And I made a little video as well.
[17:07.010 --> 17:09.250]  Just to kind of show you guys what Eric's like on vacation.
[17:09.370 --> 17:11.450]  If you'd like, I can upload that to Slack.
[17:11.830 --> 17:12.510]  It's two minutes.
[17:13.210 --> 17:14.050]  It's two minutes.
[17:14.050 --> 17:17.190]  I kept it as succinct as I could.
[17:17.510 --> 17:18.610]  Made it on my phone today.
[17:18.710 --> 17:19.810]  Okay, I think it's up.
[17:20.010 --> 17:21.030]  So you guys go watch that.
[17:21.050 --> 17:22.710]  Should we all press play at the same time?
[17:23.250 --> 17:23.610]  Sure.
[17:24.290 --> 17:24.810]  Is that Slack?
[17:25.110 --> 17:25.310]  Okay.
[17:25.570 --> 17:28.230]  And then feel free to describe as you're watching it since this is an audio podcast.
[17:28.830 --> 17:29.090]  All right.
[17:29.330 --> 17:29.850]  Are you ready, Andrew?
[17:30.050 --> 17:30.570]  I'm ready.
[17:31.090 --> 17:31.370]  All right.
[17:31.450 --> 17:32.610]  Three, two, one.
[17:32.750 --> 17:32.950]  Play.
[17:33.390 --> 17:34.250]  Eric on vacation.
[17:34.350 --> 17:35.230]  It has a title card.
[17:35.290 --> 17:36.030]  You've edited this.
[17:36.350 --> 17:36.590]  Yes.
[17:38.310 --> 17:40.370]  I'm looking at...
[17:41.150 --> 17:42.470]  Are you just filming him?
[17:43.990 --> 17:46.410]  He's already annoyed boarding the plane by the looks of it.
[17:47.670 --> 17:48.830]  He's annoyed at the airport.
[17:58.290 --> 18:00.070]  So now he's just texting?
[18:01.570 --> 18:02.610]  Okay, he's on his phone a lot.
[18:02.690 --> 18:03.890]  Is that...
[18:03.890 --> 18:05.130]  How many planes were you on?
[18:06.410 --> 18:07.210]  Oh, well.
[18:14.610 --> 18:16.450]  Is he saying, no, don't film me?
[18:16.710 --> 18:17.110]  Yes.
[18:17.550 --> 18:18.510]  Yeah, a bunch.
[18:18.750 --> 18:19.170]  A bunch.
[18:20.250 --> 18:20.830]  He's shy.
[18:23.350 --> 18:25.990]  Oh, in a hotel of some sort?
[18:26.790 --> 18:27.810]  He's checking into the hotel.
[18:32.350 --> 18:33.790]  I was really bummed.
[18:34.050 --> 18:34.350]  In the back of the car.
[18:34.830 --> 18:35.690]  In the back of the car.
[18:35.870 --> 18:37.250]  I was so bummed to miss this trip.
[18:37.330 --> 18:38.170]  Maybe I'm not now.
[18:41.630 --> 18:42.750]  Oh, he's getting boarding passes.
[18:42.750 --> 18:43.970]  I bet you he's gonna be...
[18:45.050 --> 18:47.130]  I bet you he's gonna be okay with being filmed.
[18:47.770 --> 18:48.190]  This one.
[18:49.810 --> 18:50.810]  Oh, he never notices.
[18:51.370 --> 18:51.590]  Okay.
[18:56.050 --> 18:59.510]  There's no footage of the vacation, it's all just the airport.
[18:59.690 --> 19:01.030]  It's just the airport.
[19:01.970 --> 19:04.610]  It's Eric annoyedly walking past you in first class.
[19:05.370 --> 19:06.290]  I got upgraded.
[19:06.610 --> 19:09.110]  I have so many questions of...
[19:09.110 --> 19:09.730]  I got answers.
[19:10.970 --> 19:12.410]  As soon as the video...
[19:12.410 --> 19:15.130]  How many flights, how many airports is this?
[19:16.070 --> 19:17.710]  Probably three airports, two flights.
[19:18.010 --> 19:20.310]  So, Austin to Dallas, Dallas to Cancun, then...
[19:20.310 --> 19:21.350]  You're hiding behind a bin?
[19:23.750 --> 19:25.270]  We did it, we're back.
[19:25.550 --> 19:26.350]  Tell me about the vacation.
[19:27.590 --> 19:29.010]  That's where you cut it off?
[19:29.290 --> 19:29.590]  Yeah.
[19:30.350 --> 19:31.550]  What do you mean? That's where it ended.
[19:31.710 --> 19:33.510]  The rest of my sentence was...
[19:33.510 --> 19:35.490]  Just so you guys know, how was the vacation?
[19:35.610 --> 19:36.530]  I said, it was great.
[19:36.670 --> 19:37.970]  Geoff slept a lot.
[19:39.730 --> 19:42.890]  I think the video cut off at how was the vacation and you said it.
[19:43.030 --> 19:43.110]  It did.
[19:43.570 --> 19:45.770]  Yeah, and then unfortunately that's all the footage we had.
[19:46.030 --> 19:46.870]  The freebie.
[19:47.190 --> 19:50.010]  So anyway, I feel like that encapsulates Eric.
[19:50.030 --> 19:55.890]  I wanted to get like slice of life, like fly on the wall kind of footage of him.
[19:56.050 --> 19:57.810]  And so there you have it.
[19:57.910 --> 20:00.890]  You said encapsulates Eric on vacation.
[20:01.510 --> 20:04.910]  I think Eric probably just generally doesn't like being filmed without his knowledge.
[20:05.050 --> 20:08.110]  I assume that that is not specifically a travel thing.
[20:08.110 --> 20:09.350]  Well, I don't know.
[20:09.610 --> 20:10.390]  He's filmed a lot.
[20:11.070 --> 20:13.490]  I mean, it's just mostly who...
[20:13.490 --> 20:16.690]  Are you excited walking down the aisle in an airplane?
[20:17.610 --> 20:20.850]  Well, you should have been excited because you were going on vacation.
[20:21.310 --> 20:23.410]  Some of that was coming home from vacation.
[20:24.030 --> 20:24.610]  Well, yeah.
[20:24.850 --> 20:25.470]  All right.
[20:25.530 --> 20:29.410]  Listen, there is a chunk of the vacation that was cut out.
[20:30.270 --> 20:31.070]  The vacation?
[20:31.510 --> 20:32.830]  Well, yeah, but here's why.
[20:32.950 --> 20:36.470]  That makes sense though, because I was also on vacation and I don't want to work on vacation.
[20:36.470 --> 20:39.090]  So I filmed up until my vacation started.
[20:39.230 --> 20:42.670]  And then as soon as my vacation ended, I went back to work and I filmed the rest of it.
[20:42.910 --> 20:43.190]  Well, thanks.
[20:43.290 --> 20:45.610]  The second you leave the resort, you're back on the clock.
[20:45.790 --> 20:47.010]  Yeah, I was back to work.
[20:47.450 --> 20:48.130]  That's true.
[20:48.430 --> 20:55.430]  That was... we were on... that was in the car going either to or from the airport in Mexico.
[20:56.030 --> 20:58.970]  Yeah, it was three in the morning going to the airport.
[20:59.310 --> 20:59.370]  You were clocked out.
[20:59.670 --> 21:00.370]  Yeah, that's pretty good.
[21:00.870 --> 21:06.310]  Yeah, I worked up until the second my vacation began, which was when you and I both checked into the hotel.
[21:06.310 --> 21:09.150]  And then the second it was over, I was back on the case.
[21:09.570 --> 21:12.630]  There's no way you didn't talk about f***face almost the entire time.
[21:12.950 --> 21:14.390]  Pretty much the entire time.
[21:14.450 --> 21:16.210]  It was a lot of talk about the show.
[21:16.790 --> 21:18.630]  But we were on vacation. It's different.
[21:20.130 --> 21:23.330]  I bet it was idea central though. I bet it was like the ultimate office day.
[21:23.790 --> 21:25.490]  It was pretty good. It was pretty good.
[21:26.270 --> 21:28.230]  Do you want to know some things I learned about Eric?
[21:28.570 --> 21:31.130]  I will guess that you learned that he hates board games.
[21:31.490 --> 21:33.730]  I did learn that, actually. Thank you for asking.
[21:35.090 --> 21:38.370]  Thanks, Gavin. I hadn't put that in the... let me put that... hates board games.
[21:38.650 --> 21:44.470]  At one point, we're talking and board games were brought up.
[21:44.950 --> 21:48.670]  And then Geoff immediately grabbed his phone and knew. I just knew.
[21:48.790 --> 21:49.710]  I'm like, he's texting Gavin.
[21:50.010 --> 21:52.670]  So I just texted Gavin simply, no.
[21:53.290 --> 21:55.410]  I just texted the word no.
[21:55.730 --> 21:58.170]  And then it was, oh yeah, OK, cool.
[21:58.230 --> 22:00.670]  So he was definitely texting Gavin about this. Great.
[22:00.670 --> 22:06.410]  Eric, I found out from his lovely small wife, she likes to play board games with friends.
[22:06.590 --> 22:09.610]  And Eric is board game cock blocking them from doing that.
[22:09.750 --> 22:13.670]  And so I just wanted to let Gavin know that Barbara likes to play board games.
[22:13.670 --> 22:18.370]  Untrue. I play board games with her and with other people for her.
[22:18.410 --> 22:19.290]  Sounds like you love it.
[22:19.730 --> 22:22.670]  I do not. And I make it very known that I don't.
[22:22.830 --> 22:25.910]  Here are the things I learned about Eric.
[22:25.910 --> 22:34.650]  First off, I would like to point out Eric had every opportunity in the world for four straight days to kill me.
[22:34.850 --> 22:38.010]  And he didn't do it. Not a serial killer, not a murderer.
[22:38.250 --> 22:40.490]  I think you can safely travel anywhere with them.
[22:40.830 --> 22:44.530]  I was at I was I slept in front of him for four straight days.
[22:44.610 --> 22:46.590]  I slept by the pool. I slept by the beach.
[22:46.590 --> 22:50.150]  I slept like anywhere I slept at dinner, anywhere I could sleep.
[22:50.230 --> 22:54.170]  I slept and he let he didn't even harm one hair on my head.
[22:54.170 --> 22:58.990]  So thumbs up there. Big stamp of approval traveling with Eric.
[22:59.050 --> 23:00.570]  He's not going to murder you in your sleep.
[23:01.030 --> 23:04.230]  I have 7 p.m. Friday night. I get the text from Eric.
[23:04.550 --> 23:08.470]  No, I replied. What if it's one on one chess?
[23:08.670 --> 23:10.370]  And he replied, this sucks.
[23:12.350 --> 23:16.130]  OK, things I learned about Eric. Eric hates soup.
[23:17.310 --> 23:20.910]  His exact quote was, it's been almost 40 years, man.
[23:20.990 --> 23:22.890]  I'm just not going to learn to love it.
[23:23.830 --> 23:26.210]  Eric doesn't like board games.
[23:26.830 --> 23:28.850]  Eric hates spaghetti.
[23:29.910 --> 23:34.110]  Eric hates dreams, his dreams and your dreams.
[23:34.430 --> 23:35.950]  He hates everybody's dreams.
[23:36.610 --> 23:40.230]  Eric doesn't think there are enough teams named after spiders.
[23:41.070 --> 23:43.910]  And Eric hates spoons that are hot.
[23:44.410 --> 23:46.010]  He'll eat a spoon with cold food.
[23:46.250 --> 23:49.330]  But if it touches hot food, he doesn't want the spoon anywhere near him.
[23:49.890 --> 23:52.650]  And that's pretty much it. That's all there is to Eric.
[23:55.690 --> 23:58.950]  I mean, there are no spider teams. Just think about it.
[23:59.050 --> 24:00.370]  There should be, and there's not.
[24:00.810 --> 24:01.810]  He's very upset about it.
[24:02.190 --> 24:02.850]  Seattle Spiders?
[24:03.930 --> 24:07.370]  Is that a team or did you just pick a name of a city?
[24:08.470 --> 24:09.710]  That would be a great team.
[24:10.310 --> 24:12.250]  I don't know what the sport is, but that would be great.
[24:12.730 --> 24:13.970]  I think I'm with you on that one.
[24:15.370 --> 24:17.490]  I can only think of...
[24:17.490 --> 24:18.330]  He doesn't like soup.
[24:20.030 --> 24:21.550]  It's all forms of soup.
[24:22.190 --> 24:24.510]  A mid-temperature food, like a mashed potato.
[24:25.150 --> 24:27.130]  That's warm, but not hot. Is that okay?
[24:27.870 --> 24:30.970]  Do you typically eat mashed potatoes with a spoon or with a fork?
[24:31.130 --> 24:33.830]  I feel like I have them with a fork because I'm having other food with a mashed potato.
[24:34.830 --> 24:38.170]  I guess there are times in my life where I've only had mashed potato.
[24:38.690 --> 24:39.630]  That's true, me too.
[24:41.030 --> 24:44.230]  Also, just so you know about the hot spoon thing,
[24:44.230 --> 24:48.150]  that's a Geoff concoction where he started connecting dots.
[24:48.530 --> 24:52.350]  And really all I was saying was it was just sort of found out of like,
[24:52.790 --> 24:58.530]  oh, hot foods that you would eat with a spoon, you don't really like that.
[24:58.670 --> 25:00.510]  And I guess that's just soup mostly.
[25:01.190 --> 25:04.190]  So I just started agreeing. I just started saying, yeah, it's easier.
[25:04.530 --> 25:07.010]  He 100% agreed. I clarified.
[25:07.610 --> 25:10.110]  I can't think of teams. That's a good call.
[25:10.250 --> 25:13.150]  I guess people don't like spiders, but people love Spider-Man.
[25:13.990 --> 25:16.250]  So I have a theory about this.
[25:16.590 --> 25:20.210]  Because the Cleveland Spiders used to be the team before they were the Cleveland Indians
[25:20.210 --> 25:21.490]  and now the Cleveland Guardians.
[25:22.290 --> 25:24.170]  They were originally the Cleveland Spiders.
[25:24.790 --> 25:30.570]  I have a theory that spiders are not chosen because they are seen as feminine,
[25:31.230 --> 25:34.350]  but snakes are seen as masculine.
[25:34.610 --> 25:36.910]  So you have teams named after snakes, but not after spiders.
[25:37.850 --> 25:38.610]  Are there a lot of snakes?
[25:38.690 --> 25:40.530]  Snakes as boys and spiders as girls.
[25:41.910 --> 25:42.790]  Medusa disagrees.
[25:44.270 --> 25:46.430]  I can't think of any snake teams.
[25:47.030 --> 25:47.530]  What are snake teams?
[25:47.550 --> 25:48.490]  Arizona Diamondbacks.
[25:48.970 --> 25:49.190]  Yeah.
[25:50.090 --> 25:52.290]  That's a snake thing? I didn't know that was a snake thing.
[25:52.610 --> 25:53.450]  Diamondback Battlesnake.
[25:53.810 --> 25:54.550]  Yeah, it's a snake thing.
[25:57.190 --> 26:02.910]  But when I think of spiders, I think of Anderson the Spider Silva, which is pretty fucking awesome.
[26:03.690 --> 26:06.170]  So I agree, there should be sports teams, but that's also not...
[26:06.170 --> 26:11.170]  I think of Donovan Spider Mitchell or Kevin the Durantula Durant.
[26:12.690 --> 26:16.050]  Is your favorite spider the Durantula?
[26:17.970 --> 26:20.030]  It's clearly a take on a Durantula.
[26:20.030 --> 26:23.990]  If we were doing a spider draft, that's a top three pick. Undeniably.
[26:24.050 --> 26:24.910]  It's number one.
[26:28.250 --> 26:33.190]  I'm glad that you had fun. I'm glad that you've learned so many things about Eric on your vacation.
[26:33.190 --> 26:39.510]  We all learned something fascinating about Falcons.
[26:39.950 --> 26:42.570]  What do you guys know about Falcons?
[26:44.050 --> 26:45.710]  They're really bad at football.
[26:47.290 --> 26:48.390]  They're good at punching.
[26:49.430 --> 26:51.050]  Yeah, he's got a great punch.
[26:52.090 --> 26:53.070]  Anything else?
[26:54.350 --> 26:55.190]  They're no Condor.
[26:56.530 --> 26:59.350]  Well, that's one of my notes. We do need to schedule a Condor, man.
[27:00.750 --> 27:04.490]  We get to the fucking... we get to the resort. It's like an all-inclusive place.
[27:04.690 --> 27:08.370]  Which, by the way, all Eric said for four days is anytime he ordered a drink, he'd be like,
[27:08.390 --> 27:12.010]  Can I get a margarita? And the guy's like, Yes, sir. And Eric just goes all-inclusive to himself.
[27:12.350 --> 27:17.930]  He wasn't talking to anybody. He just repeated all... every time he'd take a bite of food from the buffet, he'd go all-inclusive.
[27:18.550 --> 27:20.470]  Yeah, you should.
[27:20.610 --> 27:21.250]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:21.370 --> 27:21.850]  Yeah, absolutely.
[27:22.310 --> 27:24.070]  That's how I got so many so fast.
[27:24.450 --> 27:27.250]  And that's also how Eric got his sunglasses back when he left.
[27:27.290 --> 27:27.890]  Oh, that's true.
[27:27.890 --> 27:31.030]  And then the guy remembered him from the tip and gave them to me to give to Eric.
[27:32.290 --> 27:40.570]  By the way, the fucking buffet at that place had these candy stars that were kind of like runts that were so fucking good.
[27:41.470 --> 27:42.710]  I'm still thinking about them.
[27:43.210 --> 27:46.890]  Every meal, Geoff just ate probably a hundred stars.
[27:49.510 --> 27:52.490]  But you're the Root Canal guy. I don't know why you do it to yourself.
[27:53.170 --> 27:54.250]  I took care of my teeth.
[27:54.250 --> 27:54.930]  Okay.
[27:55.030 --> 27:58.410]  Also, doesn't that line up with what a Root Canal guy would do?
[27:59.470 --> 28:03.170]  Isn't a hundred stars predictable for the Root Canal guy?
[28:03.310 --> 28:05.870]  Yeah, but the Root Canal guy doesn't want to be known as the Root Canal guy, I assume.
[28:06.530 --> 28:09.650]  Yeah, but he can't help it. They got those delicious stars all over the place.
[28:09.670 --> 28:14.230]  The stars were good. I will say that Eric was incredibly consistent with his water adjacency.
[28:14.430 --> 28:20.910]  I never saw him get in the water. I saw him lay near the water a bunch, near the ocean, near the pool.
[28:20.910 --> 28:24.310]  Says he got into the ocean briefly, I didn't see it myself, didn't witness it.
[28:25.930 --> 28:29.190]  All-inclusive though, for sure.
[28:29.570 --> 28:31.290]  Were you mainly pool guys or beach guys?
[28:31.810 --> 28:34.570]  We started as beach guys and then we retreated to the pool.
[28:35.550 --> 28:35.950]  Nice.
[28:35.950 --> 28:43.070]  Because I was literally just laying down on a bed with a little roof on it, you know?
[28:43.830 --> 28:44.990]  Like a cabana, I guess.
[28:45.210 --> 28:47.270]  Laying down in a little cabana at like 9am.
[28:47.410 --> 28:51.530]  Emily would get up at sunup and go put shit down on the beds for us.
[28:51.610 --> 28:53.270]  And then everybody would just kind of amble on out later.
[28:53.770 --> 28:58.310]  And I would lay down and fall asleep at like 9.01 and I'd get up to go to dinner at like 5pm.
[28:58.590 --> 29:00.250]  That was pretty much it. I would just sleep the entire time.
[29:00.250 --> 29:00.530]  That's great.
[29:01.270 --> 29:07.970]  Anyway, we got there and immediately, immediately a lady walks by us with a fucking falcon.
[29:08.290 --> 29:14.870]  Like a giant falcon on her arm with like the leather thing and it had like a little falcon cap on it so it couldn't see.
[29:15.510 --> 29:16.550]  And we were like, holy shit.
[29:16.810 --> 29:19.170]  And Emily's like, oh my god, they have like a pet falcon we can touch.
[29:19.410 --> 29:21.390]  And the lady was like, don't get near this falcon.
[29:21.850 --> 29:24.070]  And they were like, stay the fuck away from the falcon.
[29:24.510 --> 29:27.970]  And we were like, why would there be a falcon that they just parade around?
[29:28.090 --> 29:30.030]  And we thought, shit, that's weird, maybe it was a guest or something.
[29:30.030 --> 29:34.150]  But the falcon kept showing up and we discovered it was, we called it the beach falcon.
[29:34.450 --> 29:35.910]  Then we called it the breakfast falcon.
[29:36.270 --> 29:38.670]  And then, uh, because it was just always around.
[29:38.770 --> 29:40.070]  And then finally I googled it.
[29:40.190 --> 29:43.650]  Do you guys have any idea why they have a falcon at this hotel?
[29:43.990 --> 29:44.570]  For rats.
[29:46.210 --> 29:47.770]  For rats and birds.
[29:48.130 --> 29:49.910]  It is a fucking defense falcon.
[29:50.570 --> 29:51.930]  It's the Orkin falcon.
[29:52.470 --> 30:00.050]  Yeah, it literally, the lady walks around the premises eight hours a day with a falcon on her arm to scare the shit out of the birds.
[30:00.090 --> 30:00.990]  And it works.
[30:01.250 --> 30:03.610]  The falcon worked every day and there were no birds.
[30:03.890 --> 30:08.270]  Sunday, I guess we determined the falcon was probably Christian, was taking the day off.
[30:09.990 --> 30:11.190]  Worshipping his bird god.
[30:11.530 --> 30:15.390]  And there were grackles and pigeons everywhere.
[30:15.730 --> 30:16.750]  Well, not pigeons, but seagulls.
[30:17.130 --> 30:18.010]  It was insane.
[30:18.190 --> 30:19.030]  So I started reading about it.
[30:19.210 --> 30:21.610]  Falcon protection is a huge industry.
[30:21.610 --> 30:28.710]  A lot of hotels in North America and in the Middle East all hire teams of falcons.
[30:28.930 --> 30:29.950]  I was reading about it.
[30:30.170 --> 30:31.210]  It's like a big business.
[30:31.450 --> 30:35.270]  Most hotels have like three or four falcons on staff that just rotate.
[30:35.710 --> 30:39.370]  And they have like four or five people whose job it is to just take care of the falcons.
[30:39.730 --> 30:41.190]  Not fucking kidding.
[30:41.330 --> 30:43.850]  It's a humane way to deal with pests and shit.
[30:43.930 --> 30:45.910]  I don't think the falcon actually goes out and kills birds.
[30:46.150 --> 30:47.850]  Although it could if it wanted to.
[30:48.030 --> 30:49.230]  It's just like scarecrowing.
[30:49.490 --> 30:50.370]  Yeah, it's just scarecrowing.
[30:50.370 --> 30:51.290]  Those things are tough as nails.
[30:51.950 --> 30:53.290]  But yeah, it was insane.
[30:53.510 --> 30:56.030]  Did they make a human version of the falcon cap?
[30:56.130 --> 30:57.730]  I was just looking at it when you brought it up.
[30:57.830 --> 30:59.550]  I'd love to see a person...
[30:59.550 --> 31:00.130]  A human falcon cap?
[31:00.310 --> 31:01.950]  A human falcon cap.
[31:02.530 --> 31:04.510]  Are you asking Uniform to get involved in this?
[31:04.510 --> 31:07.570]  I think Uniform might need a human falcon cap.
[31:07.830 --> 31:09.310]  Maybe it's like a sleep thing.
[31:09.730 --> 31:11.010]  You can block the sun out with it.
[31:11.090 --> 31:13.510]  Maybe you want to just improve your senses.
[31:13.690 --> 31:14.110]  I don't know.
[31:14.890 --> 31:19.230]  The last thing I need to be wearing is a hat where only my nose pokes through.
[31:21.230 --> 31:22.130]  That's dangerous.
[31:22.830 --> 31:24.070]  You guys, I'm serious.
[31:24.390 --> 31:27.330]  You guys should only go to hotels with intimidation falcons.
[31:27.470 --> 31:28.810]  Because you know you're fucking safe.
[31:28.910 --> 31:32.930]  I'm going to ask every hotel's falcon policy the second I book from here on out.
[31:33.310 --> 31:34.970]  It really should be a booking category.
[31:35.370 --> 31:38.550]  Like when you're booking online, you're looking for deals, looking for the cheapest.
[31:38.750 --> 31:41.510]  I would always click falcon supported.
[31:41.950 --> 31:43.350]  Is that a thing for like...
[31:43.350 --> 31:45.470]  Would a five star hotel have a falcon?
[31:45.770 --> 31:46.930]  Oh, they better.
[31:46.930 --> 31:50.050]  They better have a falcon if they're a five star hotel.
[31:50.250 --> 31:52.950]  It wouldn't have a falcon. It would have five falcons.
[31:53.130 --> 31:55.530]  How do you think you get from four to five stars, Gavin?
[31:55.830 --> 31:58.010]  It's the falcon. The falcon is what brings you there.
[32:02.970 --> 32:04.870]  That's so great. I love that.
[32:04.930 --> 32:07.390]  I assume it's got to be cruel somehow.
[32:07.770 --> 32:10.870]  I don't think so. Falcons seem pretty well cared for.
[32:10.970 --> 32:15.390]  And apparently it's a very popular practice among hotels, bigger hotels.
[32:15.390 --> 32:18.330]  So I imagine it's probably like a cush gig for a falcon.
[32:18.570 --> 32:21.610]  It gets training every day, from what I read.
[32:22.050 --> 32:24.130]  And it gets to just fucking hang out by the beach.
[32:24.650 --> 32:25.950]  And it gets Sundays off, apparently.
[32:26.550 --> 32:29.130]  You can't see the beach, but it is near the beach.
[32:29.210 --> 32:32.930]  But that's what you want. Honestly, there are people that listen to the beach sounds.
[32:33.070 --> 32:34.450]  That's still pretty good.
[32:34.990 --> 32:35.810]  You don't need to be there.
[32:36.950 --> 32:40.290]  I prefer the pool over the beach, if I'm going to hang out by something.
[32:40.710 --> 32:43.010]  The beach is almost like a little too much wilderness.
[32:43.750 --> 32:50.930]  Kick off the new year with new gear built to last.

[37:10.190 --> 37:12.750]  Oh my god. Oh my god.
[37:12.890 --> 37:16.210]  I didn't even have this listed talking about preferring the pool to the beach.
[37:16.210 --> 37:18.110]  I prefer the pool to hang out by two.
[37:18.430 --> 37:21.970]  We the first time. Oh my god.
[37:22.950 --> 37:28.990]  The first time Emily and I decided to get in the pool because we'd been beaching it for the first two days.
[37:29.610 --> 37:33.390]  And it's like, I don't know what. Be careful in Cancun.
[37:33.770 --> 37:35.870]  The water is extra salty there for some reason.
[37:36.210 --> 37:37.770]  It's way saltier than normal salt water.
[37:38.610 --> 37:41.710]  Eric doesn't know because he didn't get in the water, but he loves to argue with me about it.
[37:42.050 --> 37:45.730]  It's like the appropriately salty, but I'm telling you it was extra salty.
[37:45.730 --> 37:47.050]  Anyway, it's normal salt water.
[37:47.170 --> 37:48.950]  I just don't think Geoff's in the ocean very much.
[37:49.070 --> 37:50.890]  It's way more than you are way more than you are.
[37:51.350 --> 37:51.910]  Extra salty.
[37:52.210 --> 37:55.390]  I don't know why it was like the heavy salting this this season.
[37:56.210 --> 37:58.430]  Uh, we so we get into the pool.
[37:58.570 --> 38:00.190]  We get into this like it's a giant fucking pool.
[38:00.190 --> 38:03.830]  That's like 10 pools in one kind of thing, you know, like a hotel resort.
[38:04.090 --> 38:06.150]  And we get into like this whirlpool area.
[38:06.190 --> 38:10.090]  And like we we immediately sit in, lean our backs against the wall.
[38:10.090 --> 38:15.390]  And this group of British and American women come over and they're having a conversation.
[38:15.390 --> 38:18.330]  And I guess the British people, they just met recently.
[38:19.350 --> 38:21.210]  And the British people are just having a conversation.
[38:21.390 --> 38:22.590]  And the American ladies come over.
[38:22.870 --> 38:24.450]  And, you know, they're like maybe in the 30s.
[38:25.110 --> 38:27.890]  And we're not I'm not thinking anything of it, except they're very loud.
[38:28.190 --> 38:30.330]  The American lady goes, This is my friend, Kate.
[38:30.510 --> 38:31.590]  I'm making up the name Kate.
[38:31.830 --> 38:34.010]  I don't remember what her name was, but it definitely wasn't Kate.
[38:34.310 --> 38:35.510]  She goes, This is my friend, Kate.
[38:35.990 --> 38:38.450]  She's the one with the yeast infection.
[38:40.530 --> 38:42.690]  And I'm like in a whirlpool with these ladies, right?
[38:43.210 --> 38:45.110]  And then it gets so much worse.
[38:45.110 --> 38:47.810]  Then the British people go, Oh, I'm sorry.
[38:48.010 --> 38:48.390]  It's okay.
[38:48.550 --> 38:49.070]  You don't have to.
[38:49.170 --> 38:51.410]  And she goes and Kate goes, It's okay.
[38:51.610 --> 38:53.270]  I don't mind talking about it.
[38:53.390 --> 38:54.430]  I'm not embarrassed.
[38:56.710 --> 38:57.730]  This is great.
[38:58.190 --> 39:04.190]  So Emily and I shot up out of the pool and ran to another pool and jumped back in.
[39:04.190 --> 39:07.470]  And we're like trying to wash the yeast infection off of us.
[39:07.530 --> 39:08.330]  It was so gross.
[39:08.830 --> 39:12.890]  And just not what you want to hear right when somebody gets in a pool a foot from you.
[39:13.970 --> 39:15.670]  And so we're hanging out there for a few minutes.
[39:15.830 --> 39:16.730]  And then Emily goes, Oh, shit.
[39:16.750 --> 39:17.950]  We left our stuff at the other pool.
[39:18.110 --> 39:19.090]  I'll go back and get it.
[39:19.090 --> 39:23.330]  And she said when she went back and got it, she said they were still talking about it.
[39:23.370 --> 39:24.590]  It's been 10 solid minutes.
[39:25.150 --> 39:26.630]  She said they were still talking about it.
[39:26.630 --> 39:27.730]  She's like, I think I got it.
[39:27.890 --> 39:29.390]  I had a lot of antibiotics.
[39:29.850 --> 39:32.470]  And then, you know, you spend five or six days in a pool.
[39:32.610 --> 39:34.050]  You're going to get a yeast infection.
[39:35.390 --> 39:37.030]  You guys are so dumb.
[39:37.090 --> 39:38.250]  These are the smartest people in the world.
[39:38.570 --> 39:39.970]  They were trying to clear the pool.
[39:39.970 --> 39:41.510]  It worked.
[39:41.950 --> 39:44.170]  When Emily went back over there, they were like, oh shit, she's coming back.
[39:44.470 --> 39:47.370]  Yeah, this pesky old yeast can't shift it.
[39:47.870 --> 39:50.770]  They are the smartest women on earth if that's what they were doing.
[39:51.030 --> 39:52.890]  Because it worked like a charm.
[39:53.410 --> 39:57.790]  We were like fucking shot out of a cannon away from that whirlpool.
[39:58.350 --> 40:00.430]  Did they react at all when you immediately got up?
[40:00.710 --> 40:01.990]  I think they high-fived.
[40:02.150 --> 40:03.090]  I don't know why they high-fived.
[40:05.590 --> 40:06.370]  That's incredible.
[40:06.370 --> 40:11.030]  I'm going to try that next time it's a little crowded.
[40:13.150 --> 40:15.790]  You're just going to declare that you have a yeast infection?
[40:16.630 --> 40:17.650]  I don't know, does that work?
[40:21.550 --> 40:23.010]  What about, you need a list.
[40:23.370 --> 40:24.870]  You need, like, escalation.
[40:25.350 --> 40:28.210]  Oh man, I have these contagious warts.
[40:28.910 --> 40:34.670]  Oh man, the only thing that alleviates all these contagious warts on my ankles is this water.
[40:34.950 --> 40:35.490]  I can't reach it.
[40:35.690 --> 40:36.250]  Oh man.
[40:36.830 --> 40:39.150]  This Ebola has been getting me down recently.
[40:39.610 --> 40:41.470]  When is this jock itch going away?
[40:41.930 --> 40:45.150]  That's it, yeah, just say you had whatever Geoff has had for the last eight months.
[40:45.870 --> 40:46.290]  Oh god.
[40:49.130 --> 40:53.590]  Geoff's crotch rot mixed with that lady's yeast infection is the next plague.
[40:53.630 --> 40:59.890]  If those things get together and evolve into super virus, that's how The Last of Us started.
[41:00.190 --> 41:01.350]  That is the zombie apocalypse.
[41:01.690 --> 41:06.530]  Oh, hey, I have one other thing I'll mention here on my list, just because it's real quick.
[41:06.690 --> 41:07.470]  Mind control.
[41:08.050 --> 41:09.070]  I have an update on my fridge.
[41:10.090 --> 41:11.030]  Is the fridge here?
[41:12.550 --> 41:13.770]  No, it's supposed to be February.
[41:14.130 --> 41:18.030]  But I did, the other day, Emily was like, shouldn't we have a fridge by now?
[41:18.510 --> 41:19.830]  And I was like, oh yeah, I'll call them.
[41:19.930 --> 41:23.430]  So the next day I got up and I called them, and I talked to the lady on the phone,
[41:23.790 --> 41:27.610]  and I said, hey, I'm the idiot that bought a fridge a year ago and I'm still waiting on it.
[41:27.610 --> 41:34.010]  And she's like, not only do I remember you, I have your fridge.
[41:34.410 --> 41:35.310]  Oh my God.
[41:35.310 --> 41:36.610]  And I would like to give it to you.
[41:38.270 --> 41:39.950]  This coming Monday morning.
[41:40.670 --> 41:40.990]  No.
[41:41.250 --> 41:42.730]  They are delivering my new fridge.
[41:43.190 --> 41:43.670]  Wow.
[41:44.090 --> 41:46.930]  I am like four days away from having my fridge.
[41:47.470 --> 41:50.710]  Can we all be there to like greet it? Can we put a ribbon across the front door?
[41:50.730 --> 41:53.670]  I would love it if you guys are all well. I'll tell you when they're coming over.
[41:53.990 --> 41:55.950]  Everybody, please come for the ceremony.
[41:55.950 --> 42:00.090]  I think we should all stand in a line either side of the door and clap as the fridge gets wheeled in.
[42:00.210 --> 42:01.210]  I'm all about it.
[42:01.530 --> 42:05.250]  And then for all the inevitable problems, like how it doesn't fit through the door,
[42:05.650 --> 42:10.050]  or like they can't get the old fridge out because the island is in the way,
[42:10.230 --> 42:14.210]  or there's a hole in the floor where the fridge sat for 30 years, or whatever,
[42:14.310 --> 42:17.710]  you guys will be there to see the breakdown of when I lose my fucking mind.
[42:18.230 --> 42:20.730]  It's the start of a new season. I think we have to restart.
[42:20.990 --> 42:23.270]  We have to go to a new... it's a new arc, obviously.
[42:23.430 --> 42:24.130]  Will that be season six?
[42:24.510 --> 42:25.230]  I believe so.
[42:26.350 --> 42:27.370]  Season six is...
[42:27.370 --> 42:28.630]  Oh, that might be a good...
[42:28.630 --> 42:29.750]  New fridge, new problems.
[42:31.810 --> 42:35.230]  That's a great tagline. We're set. It's definite now.
[42:35.550 --> 42:36.590]  I want to come over and film it.
[42:37.030 --> 42:40.110]  Okay, please do. I'll let you know Monday when they call to give me the window.
[42:41.750 --> 42:42.470]  So excited.
[42:43.650 --> 42:47.370]  I have like 18 other things to talk about, but I don't have the energy to talk about any of them.
[42:47.450 --> 42:50.330]  So I figure, Andrew, you want to talk about Signal Awards.
[42:50.350 --> 42:52.150]  Are you tired from your vacation?
[42:52.910 --> 42:53.730]  All you did was sleep.
[42:53.730 --> 42:55.570]  No, I'm feeling pretty rested from the vacation.
[42:55.750 --> 42:59.550]  I'm just tired from all of this talking and thinking.
[42:59.650 --> 42:59.870]  That's fair.
[43:01.870 --> 43:04.530]  I mean, I can get into other stuff, but it's like high energy stuff.
[43:04.730 --> 43:07.730]  I have one more thing I'll talk about after Signal Awards.
[43:08.070 --> 43:08.310]  Okay.
[43:08.490 --> 43:10.870]  Well, just as very brief, we're talking about things that make no sense.
[43:10.950 --> 43:12.270]  So the Signal Awards have come out.
[43:12.770 --> 43:14.970]  Thank you for all the people who voted for us.
[43:15.010 --> 43:17.230]  We did win the listener's choice.
[43:17.470 --> 43:21.330]  Thank you to the audience for making us the listener's choice.
[43:21.330 --> 43:24.530]  Which I think, technically, I was thinking about it.
[43:24.970 --> 43:28.150]  That means that we're not just award-winning friends.
[43:28.590 --> 43:32.330]  We are award-winning friends with the most supportive listeners.
[43:33.690 --> 43:33.750]  Yeah.
[43:33.830 --> 43:37.770]  There's like a side category of like supportive of French.
[43:37.930 --> 43:44.550]  Of all the Best Buddy nominated shows, they are the best buddies to the best buddy.
[43:45.110 --> 43:46.890]  That's like a second. There's like a hurdle.
[43:47.050 --> 43:49.210]  There's like they have won their own award.
[43:49.210 --> 43:52.150]  I think in their own way, they are also award-winning friends.
[43:52.930 --> 43:55.150]  But the confusion of it.
[43:55.250 --> 43:56.810]  So when we got silver.
[43:57.430 --> 44:01.190]  Silver medal. We have a silver medal friendship, by the way.
[44:01.450 --> 44:02.610]  We have a silver medal friendship.
[44:02.970 --> 44:04.690]  But two shows got gold.
[44:04.810 --> 44:08.230]  And every other show in our category got silver.
[44:08.610 --> 44:09.890]  Which is very confusing.
[44:10.310 --> 44:13.510]  So then I started looking at other categories.
[44:13.630 --> 44:16.650]  There's some categories where there were six shows in the category.
[44:17.110 --> 44:18.590]  Five of them won gold.
[44:18.590 --> 44:20.210]  One of them won silver.
[44:20.330 --> 44:22.630]  Can you imagine how goddamn mad you'd be?
[44:22.970 --> 44:24.690]  If you're in a category of all gold.
[44:24.870 --> 44:26.670]  And you're just the only silver show.
[44:27.270 --> 44:29.350]  There were like four or five categories that were that way.
[44:29.590 --> 44:32.630]  I found a category that didn't have a gold show at all.
[44:32.950 --> 44:34.830]  They had one silver and two bronze.
[44:34.910 --> 44:36.030]  Was the entire category.
[44:36.470 --> 44:38.490]  So I was like, what is this?
[44:39.090 --> 44:40.730]  I was like, what is this system?
[44:41.050 --> 44:45.030]  I said to Eric that it's like if you were doing participation trophies.
[44:45.090 --> 44:46.850]  And it was managed by a drunk dad.
[44:46.850 --> 44:48.650]  It was like from the outside looking in.
[44:48.690 --> 44:49.690]  It didn't make sense.
[44:49.990 --> 44:52.570]  Everyone won. Technically nobody lost.
[44:52.650 --> 44:54.110]  But there were different tiers of winning.
[44:54.550 --> 44:55.550]  What does it mean?
[44:55.830 --> 44:58.950]  On our category, with two people getting gold.
[44:59.270 --> 45:05.150]  We were a third place, last place winner.
[45:05.790 --> 45:06.310]  No, we're not.
[45:06.750 --> 45:08.230]  So I emailed them.
[45:08.570 --> 45:10.210]  I was like, what is this system?
[45:10.850 --> 45:16.130]  And they said that the shows were not competing against themselves.
[45:17.550 --> 45:24.230]  Our ranking is based on their panel of judges evaluating the show as an individual thing.
[45:24.830 --> 45:28.170]  So it's not that we lost to the two gold shows.
[45:28.630 --> 45:30.390]  We are just silver quality.
[45:31.490 --> 45:32.870]  Based on their system.
[45:34.370 --> 45:35.510]  It makes no sense.
[45:35.750 --> 45:36.350]  It's not an award.
[45:36.570 --> 45:38.370]  Everyone wins the award.
[45:38.950 --> 45:43.190]  But their panel determines the value of the win.
[45:43.610 --> 45:43.730]  I guess.
[45:43.730 --> 45:44.570]  How do you get gold?
[45:44.690 --> 45:45.910]  I bet it's because we don't have a falcon.
[45:46.350 --> 45:49.110]  If we had three more falcons.
[45:49.530 --> 45:50.990]  We probably would get platinum.
[45:51.510 --> 45:53.150]  Which isn't even a ranking yet.
[45:53.990 --> 45:54.990]  I'm glad to hear you guys say that.
[45:55.010 --> 45:57.230]  Because I do think we should look into protection falconing.
[45:58.070 --> 45:59.430]  I think it's great.
[45:59.730 --> 46:01.110]  So we won.
[46:01.230 --> 46:02.230]  I was like, what?
[46:03.070 --> 46:04.590]  Do we get an award for this?
[46:04.770 --> 46:06.010]  Are there physical awards?
[46:06.110 --> 46:09.290]  I saw other people that were in the same boat we were.
[46:09.650 --> 46:11.130]  That were posting photos of awards.
[46:11.130 --> 46:12.150]  I was like, how does this work?
[46:12.270 --> 46:14.130]  And they brought up that there's a store page.
[46:14.290 --> 46:16.030]  I don't know if Eric has found out.
[46:16.150 --> 46:18.070]  I guess whoever submitted us.
[46:18.250 --> 46:20.930]  Should have also gotten a login page to the store.
[46:21.130 --> 46:22.770]  So we could buy.
[46:23.210 --> 46:24.170]  An award.
[46:24.910 --> 46:26.450]  That we would have qualified for.
[46:26.450 --> 46:28.970]  I've already reached out to our PR person.
[46:29.110 --> 46:30.390]  And she's looking into it right now.
[46:30.630 --> 46:32.010]  So we don't know how much they're worth.
[46:32.370 --> 46:34.690]  But this is probably hundreds.
[46:35.110 --> 46:37.130]  This is where I have.
[46:37.230 --> 46:39.930]  What I think is the next great idea for Unifarm.
[46:39.930 --> 46:41.010]  I think.
[46:41.310 --> 46:43.490]  We need to make our own awards.
[46:43.690 --> 46:44.770]  Called the Zimmies.
[46:45.350 --> 46:47.730]  And make it seem prestigious.
[46:48.490 --> 46:50.070]  And just email companies.
[46:50.270 --> 46:51.710]  That they've won the Zimmie award.
[46:52.010 --> 46:53.630]  And if you want it, you have to pay for it.
[46:54.110 --> 46:55.430]  And we can just make money that way.
[46:55.790 --> 46:57.870]  Are you just counting on companies just being like.
[46:57.990 --> 46:59.170]  Oh yeah, another one for the shelf.
[46:59.510 --> 46:59.970]  Absolutely.
[47:00.530 --> 47:02.810]  I love this idea.
[47:02.990 --> 47:05.490]  If you send out.
[47:05.630 --> 47:07.430]  Hundreds of emails to brands.
[47:07.430 --> 47:10.250]  Saying they've won the prestigious Zimmie award.
[47:10.670 --> 47:11.830]  Would you like to like.
[47:11.890 --> 47:13.270]  Have a statement about it.
[47:13.290 --> 47:13.990]  Like congratulations.
[47:14.670 --> 47:17.410]  Also if you'd like to buy the physical award.
[47:17.730 --> 47:18.110]  Here's the link.
[47:18.210 --> 47:20.690]  At least 10% are probably buying that award.
[47:21.130 --> 47:23.270]  We can afford Discord Nitro.
[47:23.370 --> 47:24.910]  Which we don't even need anymore.
[47:25.150 --> 47:27.450]  But that's how successful this will be.
[47:27.650 --> 47:28.730]  We can buy stuff we don't need.
[47:28.910 --> 47:29.690]  I love it.
[47:29.690 --> 47:32.450]  I like how all the trophies are so elegant often.
[47:32.730 --> 47:35.210]  They're like a man or a woman.
[47:35.210 --> 47:37.790]  In a very regal pose.
[47:37.970 --> 47:39.270]  I would love one that's just.
[47:39.650 --> 47:41.330]  A freeze frame of Don Zimmer.
[47:41.490 --> 47:42.830]  With his face in the crowd.
[47:44.650 --> 47:45.910]  What if we took like.
[47:45.990 --> 47:47.830]  Remember the Don Zimmer teddy bear.
[47:48.010 --> 47:49.950]  Like what if it was just that cold.
[47:52.750 --> 47:53.710]  So the Zimmies.
[47:54.150 --> 47:56.070]  I think could be an avenue we need to explore.
[47:56.410 --> 47:57.990]  I wonder how much we could charge.
[47:58.310 --> 48:00.810]  When I was applying for my visa.
[48:00.990 --> 48:03.310]  We discovered that the guy I worked with.
[48:03.310 --> 48:04.810]  Had an Emmy that he didn't know about.
[48:05.050 --> 48:06.250]  Like the immigration lawyer.
[48:06.930 --> 48:08.250]  Researched him and found an Emmy.
[48:08.610 --> 48:10.110]  And he was like I don't have an Emmy.
[48:10.270 --> 48:10.890]  What are you talking about?
[48:10.970 --> 48:15.330]  He had to pay $400 for the statue.
[48:16.010 --> 48:16.290]  Oh.
[48:16.830 --> 48:18.450]  If an Emmy is $400.
[48:18.950 --> 48:20.530]  I don't think the Zimmie was going to be.
[48:20.770 --> 48:23.430]  No I think the Zimmie could definitely be like $200.
[48:23.810 --> 48:25.770]  I think a Zimmie is at least half an Emmy.
[48:26.490 --> 48:26.690]  And then.
[48:28.670 --> 48:29.070]  Then.
[48:30.070 --> 48:31.830]  We'll just go to a trophy shop.
[48:31.830 --> 48:32.570]  Yeah.
[48:32.750 --> 48:35.130]  Buy a $9 trophy and put their name on it.
[48:35.190 --> 48:35.810]  And we're talking $80.
[48:36.670 --> 48:37.110]  Absolutely.
[48:37.790 --> 48:40.950]  I don't know if that money math adds up.
[48:42.250 --> 48:43.050]  Close enough.
[48:43.630 --> 48:43.790]  Yeah.
[48:44.170 --> 48:45.730]  I mean it's the heart of the idea.
[48:45.970 --> 48:46.270]  The sentiment.
[48:47.090 --> 48:47.810]  They're bullshit.
[48:48.110 --> 48:49.290]  You get regional Emmys.
[48:49.810 --> 48:52.470]  They're people that have won like the midwestern Emmys.
[48:52.690 --> 48:53.950]  It means nothing.
[48:54.350 --> 48:56.710]  Is it just like franchised around.
[48:56.710 --> 48:57.090]  Yes.
[48:57.750 --> 49:02.330]  I know somebody who has won like midwestern broadcasting Emmys.
[49:02.830 --> 49:02.930]  Wow.
[49:02.930 --> 49:04.370]  Because they direct.
[49:04.810 --> 49:07.590]  They're like the head of the direction for the Pacers.
[49:08.270 --> 49:08.530]  Interesting.
[49:08.550 --> 49:10.510]  So they have like four midwestern Emmys.
[49:11.190 --> 49:12.370]  So it lowers the grade.
[49:12.590 --> 49:14.010]  I'm saying easily $200, $250.
[49:14.690 --> 49:16.050]  For a Zimmie. No problem.
[49:16.470 --> 49:17.470]  I like it. The Zimmies.
[49:18.270 --> 49:21.350]  I think it could be a great invention for us.
[49:21.890 --> 49:23.930]  I do have one other really brief thing.
[49:24.270 --> 49:24.920]  That's just infuriating.
[49:24.920 --> 49:27.240]  As we talked about with Trials and whatnot.
[49:27.460 --> 49:29.820]  I've been trying to beat all of Gavin and Jack's times.
[49:30.180 --> 49:30.840]  And it's been going well.
[49:31.120 --> 49:33.060]  Every day we've been getting a text from Andrew
[49:33.060 --> 49:35.720]  being like the only next logical thing I can do
[49:35.720 --> 49:37.900]  is beat all your times in Trials Evolution.
[49:38.180 --> 49:39.260]  And then we just ignore that.
[49:39.380 --> 49:40.920]  And then the next day it's like Trials...
[49:41.840 --> 49:42.240]  Fusion.
[49:43.060 --> 49:44.720]  No, there is a system to it.
[49:45.620 --> 49:48.440]  Because I learned that Gavin brought Jack in
[49:48.440 --> 49:49.480]  for the Fireplace video
[49:49.480 --> 49:50.860]  to try to beat my times.
[49:51.380 --> 49:52.820]  And so I made a group text with them
[49:52.820 --> 49:55.440]  and said, upon learning of this deception
[49:55.440 --> 49:57.820]  the only rational and reasonable thing to do
[49:57.820 --> 49:59.220]  is to beat all of your times
[49:59.220 --> 50:01.320]  in Trials... whatever, the next one would be.
[50:01.900 --> 50:03.320]  And then whenever Jack would reply
[50:03.320 --> 50:05.200]  I wouldn't respond, but then the next day
[50:05.200 --> 50:07.240]  I would say the only rational and reasonable thing
[50:07.240 --> 50:08.680]  to what you just said
[50:08.680 --> 50:11.240]  is to beat your times in the next game.
[50:11.660 --> 50:13.060]  And I was trying to go through all the games
[50:13.060 --> 50:14.460]  but then Jack stopped replying.
[50:14.780 --> 50:17.080]  So I congratulated him on doing the
[50:17.080 --> 50:18.340]  Dopey Marathon thing.
[50:18.500 --> 50:20.200]  And he was like, oh, thanks man.
[50:20.200 --> 50:21.700]  I appreciate it.
[50:21.760 --> 50:24.300]  And then I replied to that, the only rational and reasonable thing
[50:24.300 --> 50:25.340]  is to beat all of your times
[50:25.340 --> 50:27.640]  in Trials... whatever 4 is.
[50:27.820 --> 50:29.440]  So you've just gone apeshit with Trials.
[50:29.820 --> 50:31.160]  I've been going apeshit with Trials
[50:31.160 --> 50:33.280]  and you have some great times.
[50:33.460 --> 50:35.320]  Like across multiple games, there is this time
[50:35.320 --> 50:37.840]  where Gavin was like 2000th
[50:37.840 --> 50:39.720]  in the world and I could not
[50:39.720 --> 50:41.540]  figure out how you did it
[50:41.540 --> 50:43.840]  and I was struggling with it. And the second Trials game
[50:43.840 --> 50:46.220]  has a bug where when you go to watch replays
[50:46.220 --> 50:47.300]  it just is glitched.
[50:47.300 --> 50:49.940]  None of the videos work, from my experience.
[50:50.380 --> 50:51.600]  So I've been trying to grind it out.
[50:51.700 --> 50:53.880]  I spent genuinely 7 or 8 hours
[50:53.880 --> 50:55.360]  trying to do it. I'm getting close.
[50:55.760 --> 50:57.340]  I'm narrowing it in and I
[50:57.340 --> 50:59.480]  finally beat it and I'm so fucking
[50:59.480 --> 51:01.680]  happy and then this screen pops up.
[51:01.940 --> 51:03.140]  I beat Gavin's time
[51:03.140 --> 51:05.260]  after like 7 hours and it says
[51:05.260 --> 51:07.500]  please reconnect. You cannot
[51:07.500 --> 51:09.560]  post to the Xbox Live leaderboards
[51:09.560 --> 51:11.240]  without a connection to Xbox Live.
[51:11.600 --> 51:13.120]  Please reconnect now
[51:13.120 --> 51:15.580]  and try reposting. Alternatively
[51:15.580 --> 51:17.460]  you can discard your
[51:17.460 --> 51:19.560]  score and continue playing
[51:19.560 --> 51:21.460]  offline. I
[51:21.460 --> 51:23.560]  mashed retry for
[51:23.560 --> 51:25.520]  like 10 minutes and it would not
[51:25.520 --> 51:27.800]  go through. I had to forfeit the time.
[51:28.260 --> 51:29.800]  I had to then spend 2 more hours
[51:29.800 --> 51:31.840]  to get the time back. It took me 2 additional
[51:31.840 --> 51:33.640]  hours because the game
[51:33.640 --> 51:35.480]  was bugged and it just randomly decided
[51:35.480 --> 51:36.260]  to not let me connect.
[51:37.340 --> 51:39.580]  It doesn't make any sense that it can't just store a local
[51:39.580 --> 51:41.600]  copy of that time and just upload it later.
[51:42.280 --> 51:43.400]  It makes
[51:43.400 --> 51:44.140]  zero sense at all.
[51:45.180 --> 51:47.540]  While you were enjoying and learning about
[51:48.340 --> 51:49.220]  rashes and
[51:49.220 --> 51:51.640]  yeast infections and falcons in Cancun
[51:52.160 --> 51:53.480]  I was trying to
[51:53.480 --> 51:55.340]  beat Gavin in Trials. And that was in Evolution?
[51:56.220 --> 51:57.540]  That was the second
[51:57.540 --> 51:59.120]  I think that's in Evolution isn't it?
[51:59.280 --> 52:00.960]  I don't even remember getting a good time in that game.
[52:01.320 --> 52:03.480]  I remember my freak accident one in Trials HD
[52:03.480 --> 52:05.400]  but I didn't realize I'd actually done any good
[52:05.400 --> 52:06.820]  in Evolution. Oh you have some
[52:07.340 --> 52:09.080]  great times in Trials Evolution. Wow.
[52:09.180 --> 52:11.260]  That's interesting. I wonder if I can take any back.
[52:11.660 --> 52:13.160]  Xbox 360 did some weird
[52:13.160 --> 52:14.820]  shit to games like that back in the day.
[52:14.940 --> 52:17.260]  I remember one time I was playing an arcade game and I was
[52:17.260 --> 52:19.080]  like 15 hours into it and I had
[52:19.080 --> 52:21.000]  one or two achievements left in it.
[52:21.380 --> 52:23.000]  And the internet dropped
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.060]  in the middle of it and it was just all gone.
[52:25.620 --> 52:27.380]  Like I just lost all progress in the game.
[52:27.780 --> 52:28.760]  Oh my god.
[52:28.960 --> 52:30.380]  It was like I'd never played it before.
[52:30.820 --> 52:31.840]  Oh my god.
[52:33.140 --> 52:34.620]  It was like Thanos snapped it away.
[52:34.940 --> 52:37.100]  I feel like that shit happened all the time with 360.
[52:37.900 --> 52:39.360]  The first Hitman did that to me
[52:39.360 --> 52:41.360]  a lot. When it first came out there were like tremendous
[52:41.360 --> 52:43.380]  server issues. I kept getting
[52:43.380 --> 52:45.320]  disconnected. But even though it's a single player
[52:45.320 --> 52:46.820]  game it would just boot you back to the menu.
[52:47.700 --> 52:48.720]  Absolutely no sense.
[52:49.360 --> 52:50.240]  That's so weird.
[52:51.080 --> 52:53.440]  Yeah that sucks. I never had anything like that.
[52:53.500 --> 52:54.580]  I'd have things like in Fallout
[52:55.780 --> 52:57.360]  not manually saving ever
[52:57.360 --> 52:58.880]  just going off of the autosave
[52:58.880 --> 53:01.200]  and dying at the same time as opening
[53:01.200 --> 53:03.660]  a door like 27 hours into the game.
[53:04.020 --> 53:05.400]  So every time I'd reload into
[53:05.400 --> 53:07.440]  my save it would just be me dying immediately.
[53:07.920 --> 53:09.320]  I had to restart Fallout
[53:09.320 --> 53:11.540]  New Vegas because of that. Like 20 something hours
[53:11.540 --> 53:13.260]  in. The whole game? Sucked.
[53:13.480 --> 53:15.540]  The whole game. The whole game
[53:15.540 --> 53:17.380]  it sucked. That's the only time
[53:17.380 --> 53:19.380]  and that's how good Fallout New Vegas is. Like I actually
[53:19.380 --> 53:20.860]  went back and I played through it again.
[53:21.380 --> 53:22.960]  It's a great game. Yeah, great game.
[53:23.700 --> 53:24.820]  That's the end of it for me.
[53:25.160 --> 53:26.980]  So Gavin are you going to beat all those times back?
[53:28.080 --> 53:29.580]  I mean I'm sure I can sneak
[53:29.580 --> 53:31.360]  one of them back and reveal it
[53:31.360 --> 53:33.400]  months from now. Honestly Geoff
[53:33.400 --> 53:35.600]  I'm just hoping that he shows up to play Warzone
[53:35.600 --> 53:37.760]  is where I'm at. I'm not worried about his times.
[53:38.120 --> 53:39.740]  Is that why you asked me
[53:39.740 --> 53:41.480]  if I wanted to play Warzone with you? Am I your
[53:41.480 --> 53:42.920]  backup in case Gavin doesn't show?
[53:43.460 --> 53:45.160]  Well it's just we, for some reason
[53:45.160 --> 53:47.580]  we tried to play Halo while you
[53:47.580 --> 53:49.520]  were in Cancun and there were not enough
[53:49.520 --> 53:51.540]  people in the playlist to find a match for
[53:51.540 --> 53:53.540]  what we wanted to do. And then we
[53:53.540 --> 53:55.400]  started playing Warzone which Gavin had never played
[53:55.400 --> 53:57.520]  and he's like, this is great why don't
[53:57.520 --> 53:59.620]  you ever invite me to this? And I said, I don't know
[53:59.620 --> 54:01.520]  this is, you're the only person I play Halo
[54:01.520 --> 54:03.140]  with. This is what I primarily play.
[54:03.640 --> 54:05.120]  And then I saw there were trios
[54:05.120 --> 54:07.080]  so I was like, shit. There's
[54:07.080 --> 54:09.340]  quads? You do four people? Yeah. I played
[54:09.820 --> 54:11.240]  I played the shit out of
[54:11.240 --> 54:13.000]  Warzone. I haven't really played Warzone 2
[54:13.000 --> 54:14.720]  Who'd you play with? Warzone?
[54:15.160 --> 54:17.020]  Yeah. By myself. They do
[54:17.020 --> 54:19.360]  you can do singles, doubles, trios or quads
[54:19.360 --> 54:21.200]  so I would always just play solo. Do you want to try
[54:21.200 --> 54:22.900]  trios with us? Yeah of course.
[54:23.120 --> 54:25.240]  Nick loves Warzone 2. We should just get everybody
[54:25.240 --> 54:27.100]  into Warzone. Let's do quads. Let's just
[54:27.100 --> 54:29.180]  all play. Let's get Nick in. We'll all play. Andrew and I did a
[54:29.180 --> 54:31.160]  cool stunt where we swapped cars while we were
[54:31.160 --> 54:31.420]  driving.
[54:33.980 --> 54:35.320]  That's great. It's a great game.
[54:35.500 --> 54:37.160]  You just do dumb bullshit in the
[54:37.160 --> 54:39.340]  open world. I learned that if you can angle
[54:39.340 --> 54:41.200]  yourself, there's a train that goes
[54:41.200 --> 54:43.300]  around the map, and I learned if you angle
[54:43.300 --> 54:45.220]  yourself the right way, it clips onto
[54:45.220 --> 54:47.140]  you. Like you can hook onto it. So I
[54:47.140 --> 54:49.100]  got downed and then I crawled
[54:49.100 --> 54:51.100]  and I angled myself to the train and the train
[54:51.100 --> 54:53.280]  just pushed me like 60 feet away
[54:53.280 --> 54:55.200]  from the guy who was trying to find me.
[54:55.300 --> 54:57.120]  Because I was going at train speeds while
[54:57.120 --> 54:58.880]  on the ground. It was very dumb.
[54:58.880 --> 55:01.020]  The game is so broken, but
[55:01.020 --> 55:02.560]  there's some good dumb bullshit in it.
[55:03.420 --> 55:05.000]  Do you guys ever think
[55:05.000 --> 55:06.940]  about how every time you go
[55:06.940 --> 55:09.180]  outside, you're walking into
[55:09.180 --> 55:10.100]  a bird's toilet?
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.100]  We live
[55:13.100 --> 55:14.580]  at the bottom of the toilet
[55:14.580 --> 55:16.600]  for every bird on Earth.
[55:16.800 --> 55:19.280]  I looked it up. There are 50 billion
[55:19.280 --> 55:21.200]  birds on Earth. So basically
[55:21.200 --> 55:22.960]  every day we walk
[55:22.960 --> 55:25.220]  outside, it's
[55:25.220 --> 55:26.960]  like we're walking from one end of a toilet
[55:26.960 --> 55:28.380]  bowl to the other and we're just hoping
[55:28.380 --> 55:30.920]  the 50 billion animals don't shit on our heads.
[55:31.800 --> 55:32.940]  I mean, I live in an
[55:33.500 --> 55:34.820]  especially... there's a panel
[55:36.140 --> 55:37.040]  there's a panel
[55:37.040 --> 55:39.040]  above my front door for my
[55:39.040 --> 55:41.100]  building that got knocked off a long time
[55:41.100 --> 55:42.760]  ago. And nobody's fixed it.
[55:43.120 --> 55:44.940]  And birds now live in the roof and they
[55:44.940 --> 55:47.260]  just shit down the hole and it lines up perfectly
[55:47.260 --> 55:49.040]  with the... I quite literally every time
[55:49.040 --> 55:50.920]  I step outside, it's... you're
[55:50.920 --> 55:52.900]  taking a dice roll. I feel like
[55:52.900 --> 55:55.020]  I got shat on as a kid so much
[55:55.020 --> 55:57.140]  more than I do now. Do you think you went outside
[55:57.140 --> 55:59.020]  more as a kid than you do now? I mean, that must
[55:59.020 --> 56:01.160]  be it, right? Or maybe just birds
[56:01.160 --> 56:02.740]  are more shitty in England? I don't know.
[56:03.060 --> 56:05.180]  I don't know. When was the last time you got dumped on?
[56:05.900 --> 56:06.600]  By a bird?
[56:07.040 --> 56:07.280]  Yeah.
[56:10.300 --> 56:11.020]  I can't
[56:11.020 --> 56:13.040]  remember a specific incident, but it's
[56:13.040 --> 56:14.820]  happened in my adult life for sure.
[56:15.560 --> 56:16.980]  In the last four or five years, I would
[56:16.980 --> 56:19.020]  think. I've found a little bit of bird poop on my
[56:19.020 --> 56:20.540]  shoulder or something. I don't know.
[56:20.720 --> 56:21.720]  It doesn't happen that often.
[56:22.480 --> 56:23.700]  I've been doing a lot of...
[56:24.280 --> 56:24.640]  Yes?
[56:26.140 --> 56:27.780]  My internet's shit today. I think it's
[56:27.780 --> 56:29.700]  because of all the uploading. Are you still uploading
[56:29.700 --> 56:31.620]  that file? No, it's done! The
[56:31.620 --> 56:33.740]  Fire Police video is up on the F*** Face
[56:33.740 --> 56:35.780]  channel and now we just have to wait for YouTube
[56:35.780 --> 56:37.700]  to decide if it's gonna
[56:37.700 --> 56:40.160]  come out. It ended up being 248
[56:40.160 --> 56:41.720]  gigs? Yes. Well, I tried
[56:41.720 --> 56:43.660]  to make it as big as possible, because
[56:43.660 --> 56:45.500]  obviously I'm compressing it down to like
[56:45.500 --> 56:47.480]  5% of its original size, so
[56:47.480 --> 56:49.680]  we could upload it. But I'm trying to max out
[56:49.680 --> 56:51.380]  what we get and I ended up
[56:51.780 --> 56:53.720]  doing one that was slightly too big and then I did one
[56:53.720 --> 56:55.960]  again that was like 245
[56:55.960 --> 56:57.780]  gigs. Do you know how long
[56:57.780 --> 56:59.680]  it's gonna take to process? Does it give you a...
[57:00.240 --> 57:01.680]  No, should I check now and see if it's done?
[57:02.080 --> 57:03.340]  Yeah. Is it up?
[57:04.140 --> 57:06.000]  Hang on. Switch account.
[57:06.440 --> 57:07.720]  Eric gave me F*** Face today.
[57:08.260 --> 57:09.740]  Is that your bird shithole? That's
[57:09.740 --> 57:10.700]  my bird shithole.
[57:12.220 --> 57:13.720]  It lines up perfectly
[57:15.140 --> 57:15.720]  with the
[57:15.720 --> 57:17.360]  walkway right down here.
[57:18.240 --> 57:19.200]  Lines up straight.
[57:19.360 --> 57:20.420]  It's dangerous. It's a dangerous game.
[57:21.040 --> 57:23.360]  Uh-oh. It says checks
[57:23.360 --> 57:25.120]  still running. Checking
[57:25.120 --> 57:26.560]  one found. What does this mean?
[57:27.100 --> 57:29.620]  Uh-oh. Did we film a copyrighted
[57:29.620 --> 57:30.040]  fireplace?
[57:31.160 --> 57:31.620]  No.
[57:33.720 --> 57:35.300]  Could you imagine if like brick, you could
[57:35.300 --> 57:36.200]  copyright brick?
[57:37.180 --> 57:38.240]  No, it's just
[57:39.060 --> 57:40.700]  us and our shit in there.
[57:41.300 --> 57:42.220]  Yeah. Oh.
[57:42.860 --> 57:45.260]  It just says copyright still checking. So what does it
[57:45.260 --> 57:47.300]  say? One found. Okay, so by the
[57:47.300 --> 57:49.420]  looks of it, it hasn't even started processing yet.
[57:49.760 --> 57:51.200]  Okay. So why have you been going
[57:51.200 --> 57:52.040]  outside? What have you been doing?
[57:53.160 --> 57:55.200]  Oh, I've just been a bit of a stump
[57:55.200 --> 57:56.720]  guy. I'm trying to get rid of a stump.
[57:57.400 --> 57:58.540]  Getting chainsaws involved.
[58:00.720 --> 58:01.360]  And, uh...
[58:01.360 --> 58:03.280]  You know how, like, I'm
[58:03.280 --> 58:05.180]  just, like, technology's getting away from me. Like,
[58:05.200 --> 58:07.280]  I got really confused when I thought I was talking to Dan
[58:07.280 --> 58:09.340]  but I was really talking to my own ringtone and Dan.
[58:09.400 --> 58:09.660]  Mm-hmm.
[58:10.800 --> 58:13.040]  I was just chainsawing down some branches
[58:13.040 --> 58:14.400]  and stuff and I thought,
[58:15.080 --> 58:16.620]  oh, that's a cool new feature.
[58:17.020 --> 58:19.080]  Every time I started chainsawing
[58:19.080 --> 58:21.100]  something, the volume on
[58:21.100 --> 58:23.080]  my AirPods went up.
[58:23.360 --> 58:25.140]  And I was like, oh shit, do they have, like,
[58:26.420 --> 58:27.220]  automatic noise
[58:27.220 --> 58:28.800]  compensation? This is great.
[58:29.900 --> 58:31.100]  And I was, like, practicing
[58:31.100 --> 58:32.880]  it. I was like, wow, it does. Every time I start
[58:32.880 --> 58:34.980]  chainsawing this log, it turns up the volume
[58:34.980 --> 58:37.060]  and then when I stop, it turns it back down again.
[58:37.420 --> 58:39.020]  This rules. And I was like,
[58:39.740 --> 58:40.960]  almost about to go inside
[58:40.960 --> 58:42.920]  and bore Meg with that. And then I realized
[58:42.920 --> 58:44.980]  what was actually happening. I'm gonna post a
[58:44.980 --> 58:46.680]  slack right now. Okay.
[58:47.100 --> 58:47.920]  Five second video.
[58:49.320 --> 58:50.980]  Uh, the glove was rubbing
[58:50.980 --> 58:52.200]  against the dial on my watch.
[58:52.740 --> 58:54.200]  And turning the volume up and down.
[58:55.960 --> 58:56.980]  Basically, every time I moved
[58:56.980 --> 58:59.020]  my arm in that direction, my glove would roll
[58:59.020 --> 59:00.960]  up the volume and then I would stop and it would
[59:00.960 --> 59:02.840]  roll the volume down. And I was like, oh,
[59:03.260 --> 59:04.380]  that's not as...
[59:04.380 --> 59:06.960]  How big a round is a stump are we talking about?
[59:07.280 --> 59:08.960]  Ooh, I'd say...
[59:08.960 --> 59:10.640]  What would that be? A foot?
[59:10.980 --> 59:12.140]  Front yard or back yard? Back.
[59:12.500 --> 59:15.240]  You need to hire, you just need to hire
[59:15.240 --> 59:17.040]  a guy with a stump grinder
[59:17.040 --> 59:19.060]  to come in and take care of it. Now, here's where you're wrong.
[59:19.480 --> 59:20.960]  My quote for getting the stump ground
[59:20.960 --> 59:23.180]  away was like 350 bucks.
[59:23.740 --> 59:25.040]  And I have a
[59:25.040 --> 59:26.980]  chainsaw, which I think I've
[59:26.980 --> 59:28.660]  ruined. And an axe, which I've ruined.
[59:28.800 --> 59:30.880]  And a bunch of other tools. And it turns out, I was
[59:30.880 --> 59:32.620]  more determined to waste
[59:32.620 --> 59:34.920]  350 bucks destroying the tools I already
[59:34.920 --> 59:36.860]  have, than just to pay a guy to do it.
[59:36.860 --> 59:38.800]  Yeah, the cool thing is, is he'll come
[59:38.800 --> 59:40.700]  and do it, and all your shit doesn't break,
[59:40.820 --> 59:42.960]  and then he leaves. And he probably takes a lot
[59:42.960 --> 59:44.480]  of the sawdust and shit with him.
[59:44.620 --> 59:46.900]  I've had a lot of stumps ground, and it's like the coolest
[59:46.900 --> 59:49.080]  service ever. And it's also fun to watch.
[59:49.600 --> 59:50.980]  The thing is, the thing is that annoyed me
[59:50.980 --> 59:53.020]  though, is you could buy a stump grinder for like a grand.
[59:53.400 --> 59:54.940]  So that guy's making back the money
[59:54.940 --> 59:56.720]  on his grinder, within like
[59:57.120 --> 59:58.380]  four or five jobs probably.
[59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.900]  What you're saying is, we need to get
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:02.600]  into stump grinding as a side hustle.
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.820]  Or at least we should definitely have one, so it's like an option
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.040]  for us. Yeah, absolutely. Sounds like you're always
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.800]  using them. I've had
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.720]  like three stumps ground in my yard, I think.
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.860]  Or four, yeah. Now what is
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.700]  I've never heard, a stump grinder?
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.320]  Yeah. It's like a...
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.680]  What is that? It's like a machine
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.900]  with circular saws and a bunch of... it looks like a horror
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.460]  movie. It looks like something you gotta saw.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.820]  Huh. And there's different kinds.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.820]  But the nice thing about a stump grinder too, is it gets
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.620]  under the... because you know, you still have the fucking
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.900]  giant ass... what are
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.400]  connected to stumps? Roots!
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.180]  Yeah, you know. Roots? Yeah.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.560]  And that's what I'm up against now.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.260]  I'm getting stupid as I get old.
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:39.740]  I'm having to dig.
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.280]  I'm like chainsawing away, getting through
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.480]  slice by slice, and I'm having to dig up
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.400]  lower, like trying to... eventually I'm
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.220]  just gonna bury what's left of the stump, I think.
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.420]  Because I've destroyed all of
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.400]  my tools. Are you at
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.300]  least like on your way to a bean hole?
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:56.400]  Like how's the hole...
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.520]  once you get rid of the stump, or you bury
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.560]  the stump, how far until you think
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.180]  you're in bean territory, potentially?
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.560]  I don't... I'm definitely not
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.560]  as deep as Geoff's, and I'm making...
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.460]  because I should have just done
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.660]  10 minutes of research, but all I'm doing
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.300]  is just kind of screwing around.
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.320]  Like I'm drilling deep holes into the stump
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.480]  to make it easier for me to cut into
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.440]  slices, but then when I'm digging
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.540]  a bunch of stone... like my yard
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.600]  is full of tiny stones and rocks like Geoff's.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.540]  A lot of the stones are like falling into the
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:26.760]  holes, so then when I'm chainsawing through the stump
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.820]  it's like a firework display.
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:30.760]  Like the chain is hitting the tiny
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.500]  stones and sparks are just shooting
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.500]  stones out of these holes. It's lethal.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.560]  It's not worth it. I'm really glad you saved that
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.320]  $350 as an investment.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.500]  It would have been the best $350
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.900]  I ever spent, it turned out.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.660]  As I almost blind myself
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:45.640]  and set fire to the yard.
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.820]  We are... we're right at like that hour
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.880]  so we do need to wrap up, but I'm gonna post
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.360]  this and then you guys see it, and then
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.540]  I'll delete the link so that way he doesn't see it.
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:55.960]  But this went up today.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.940]  Oh. Oh man.
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:59.680]  This is something we should promote.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.620]  If you go to store.roosterteeth.com
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:03.840]  we put up a new
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.980]  4 inch decal that is
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:07.680]  Jack's face
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.360]  that simply says
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.300]  anal passage below it.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.080]  There's no other piece
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.960]  that's the whole thing. Is that what I
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.020]  approved today? Yes.
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.940]  Oh shit. Yep.
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:21.980]  Well you probably should have looked at it, that's why
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:24.040]  I tagged you, brought you over there. I knew you weren't gonna look
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.080]  at it. They just said, they just said, can we sell
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.080]  the anal passage sticker and I was like, yeah, why wouldn't
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.140]  you sell it? I didn't realize. Well, you know.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.700]  What's wrong? Alright, well, shots
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:34.240]  fired, I guess. Well, it's on sale now!
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:35.720]  Store.roosterteeth.com.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.280]  Chef, what did you think it was?
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.940]  Uh, I don't know. I just thought
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.880]  maybe like the logo with the anal passage
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.080]  logo on it. Isn't that a cool answer
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.800]  for the guy who's approving it?
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.820]  I forgot. What did you think it was? I don't know.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.880]  I was in the middle of writing stuff.
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.980]  I was busy. It was just a fucking sticker. I didn't
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.660]  Yeah, it is!
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.900]  Not replying, but once again.
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.680]  Absolutely. Get to it when you get to it.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:00.980]  Yep.
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:03.940]  So, that's on sale now.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.880]  Store.roosterteeth.com. Go and check it out.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:08.900]  It's a lot.
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.080]  Before we end, have you guys seen
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.980]  that new Peacock show, The Traitors?
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:15.480]  No.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.680]  Alright, well, you should watch it
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.080]  because it's a reality TV
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.160]  competition show.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.000]  It's fucking awesome. It's basically
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.720]  Werewolf. Okay.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.240]  The game, but live action
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.940]  where 20 people
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.320]  are like 10 reality TV stars
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.060]  I think, or 15 or something, and then like
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.140]  10 or 15 normal people, and they're all in a
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.120]  house, and every night they go to bed and one of them
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.160]  gets murdered, and then the next morning they try to figure out
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.140]  who the traitors are. I mean, it's Werewolf.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.220]  It's exactly Werewolf, but it's done like in a castle
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.100]  in Scotland. It's done really well and
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.920]  it's got a lot of people you'll recognize from Big Brother
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.980]  and Survivor and stuff, but Alan
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:51.920]  Cumming is the fucking host
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.360]  of that show, and he is the most delightful
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.020]  host I've ever seen in
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.380]  the history of reality TV.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:58.920]  That feels perfect for him.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.960]  The entire show is worth watching it just for
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.880]  the moments that he's on camera. He is a
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.960]  goddamn treat to watch.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:07.360]  And I wish we had...
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.800]  I don't think I've ever seen him not in character.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.900]  I wish we had people of his caliber hosting
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:14.120]  reality shows like this. I hope it's a sign
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.820]  of things to come. He's Scottish, right?
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.000]  Yeah, he takes it to a whole other level.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.440]  He's phenomenal.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:22.180]  And it's also cool to see
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:23.600]  Werewolf done
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.900]  in a high production setting. It's a lot of fun.
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:27.640]  Is it like one
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.040]  game that's being told throughout this
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.960]  entire season? Yeah, it's basically like
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.800]  in the daytime they get up. There's like
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.580]  three traitors and like 17
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:37.800]  uh... I forget what they call them.
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.320]  But like normal people.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.400]  Faithful, they call them.
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.260]  Like 17 faithful. And then
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.160]  they'll do a competition
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.040]  together to win money. And basically
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.240]  it's different than the mole in that like
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.220]  in the mole, the mole's trying to get them to
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.400]  lose money. And that's how they succeed.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.240]  And this one, if
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.180]  any of the traitors are there
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.680]  at the end, they win the money.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.240]  And if no traitors are left, then the people
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.340]  that are left win the money. And it's like 250 grand.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.220]  And so they do like a competition at the beginning
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.840]  of the show where they try to make
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.220]  as much money as possible. And I guess
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.120]  like the traitors can fuck with them if they want to.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.020]  But it doesn't really help them because they're
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.900]  trying to look unsuspicious and
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.000]  their hope they want to live
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.380]  to steal the money later anyway.
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:21.180]  And then they'll sit around a round
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:22.660]  table and they'll vote somebody out
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.100]  who they think is guilty and then they just
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:27.060]  all fight about it. And then they go to bed
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:28.620]  and then the traitors murder somebody.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.280]  So every episode two people get eliminated. Which is cool.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:31.960]  That's great.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.240]  What you're describing feels perfect for Alan Cumming.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.200]  Like I could murder mystery type thing
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.160]  like him really leaning into that. That'd be fun.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.040]  He just has like fabulous
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.040]  outfits and he's like so
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.140]  emotive and just like
[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:47.200]  in it. Like he's just great in it.
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.240]  So anyway, that's my recommendation. Watch Alan
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.620]  Cumming host the show.
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:52.440]  Best Alan Cumming role?
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:54.840]  Floop?
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.760]  Floop? Loop? Floop? Roop?
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.320]  Floop? Spy Kids?
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.960]  The Spy Kids guy. I didn't know what you were saying there.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.000]  Floop, right? His name was Floop.
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:04.760]  I thought you were malfunctioning.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.680]  No, I think it was Floop.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.320]  He's great in that.
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:10.720]  What do you think the best Alan Cumming
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.060]  role is? Goldeneye?
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.740]  Yeah. He's invincible. He's pretty good
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:15.140]  in Goldeneye.
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.820]  Was he in... No Floop.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.920]  Yeah, he was Nightcrawler.
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:21.580]  He was Nightcrawler. Great.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.580]  So you're gonna let me know on Monday when I should come
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.200]  and film The Fridge?
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.100]  As soon as I find out
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:30.140]  I will let you know. And then
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:32.080]  I actually made it through a lot of my list today.
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.780]  I appreciate you guys indulging me.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.580]  I have still to cover
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:38.060]  in a future episode, cookbook progress.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.640]  I've made a lot of progress on the cookbook.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:41.400]  You've been killing it with that cookbook.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.680]  The novelization of...
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:45.960]  I really wanted to talk about the novelization
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.860]  I did. And how I wanted to know how everybody
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.780]  liked it. Gavin didn't seem to like it. But everybody else
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:50.400]  I was wondering.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.540]  Sprit bit biased.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:55.060]  Maybe I'll read it next episode.
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.620]  Yeah, you should read that passage.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.340]  I just made it as a test.
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:06:59.940]  I'll do it right now if you want.
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:00.740]  I don't have it fucking open.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.200]  The other day
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.720]  I was reading
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.340]  Reddit
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:09.620]  I believe. And somebody
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:12.140]  had listed a transcription
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.300]  of all of the cucumber stuff.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.140]  And I thought it read funnier
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.440]  than the podcast was.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.780]  And that got me thinking. I wonder what would happen
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.060]  if we novelized an episode of a podcast.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.940]  So I did. The other day when I was
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:25.760]  writing the cookbook, I took a break from the cookbook
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.880]  to write just one page
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.660]  of what it could look like.
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:31.280]  And so here I'll give this to the audience.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.980]  And we'll see what you think.
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.660]  F***face episode 135
[01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:37.900]  The Novel. Adapted from the
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:40.220]  podcast of the same name by Geoff Ramsey.
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:41.640]  This is short.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:43.360]  So just sit with me.
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.000]  As with most days, it began
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:46.760]  with an argument.
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.700]  I was not earlier
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:51.980]  than dude! A clearly
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:53.320]  defensive Gavin declared.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.860]  Technically it was 11
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:57.960]  59 when you jumped in on my clock.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.880]  Eric calmly started as Gavin
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.440]  interrupted. What was it?
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.820]  He declared indignantly with the
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.920]  pompous wine reserved for only the most
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:08.180]  posh of Brits. Eric continued
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.940]  undeterred, unfazed.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.080]  I'm just letting you know.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.680]  Your clock is...
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.940]  He began, but Eric continued patiently
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:17.840]  knowing full well how to deal with
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.460]  the mood swings of this man-child.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.880]  All I'm saying, all I'm
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.860]  saying is that it was 11 59
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.680]  on my clock. That's all. I'm not
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.020]  accusing you of anything.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.000]  Your clock is wrong!
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.680]  I'm simply stating a fact.
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.820]  Geoff chose that moment to enter the
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:35.640]  conversation. It was 11
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.720]  59 when... Well, hold on a second.
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.780]  He then immediately and expertly
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:41.860]  switched gears, refusing to be derailed.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.800]  Hello and welcome to the
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.640]  F*** Face podcast. Eric, what
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.680]  number is this? And with that, the
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.100]  podcast was officially in session.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.200]  Uh, this is 135,
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.100]  Eric answered, uh,
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.060]  trembling with fear of Geoff's impressive
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.120]  nature. Uh,
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.060]  Episode 135? Probably.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.320]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and with me as always
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:02.860]  Gavin Free and Andrew Panton. And
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:05.040]  Gavin, you were one minute early today.
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:06.740]  You've never been early in your life.
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:09.240]  Why did you decide to change things up?
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.080]  A brilliant dig, knowing
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.000]  it would strike at the weakest part of Gavin's
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.600]  perennially on-time psyche.
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.020]  The Brit was defeated, and he knew it.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.760]  But tried to defend himself anyway.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.800]  I wasn't early,
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.900]  I joined at exactly 12 o'clock.
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:24.820]  A statement clearly no one believed.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.020]  Least of all him.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.080]  And scene. That's all I have so far.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.900]  Why do I sound like Droopy?
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:32.720]  You sound like you've been
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.440]  attacked by 90 bees.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.940]  Oh, that's just my Gavin voice.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.620]  That's how he sounds to me, in my head.
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.780]  Oh my god. I wish he sounded
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:42.420]  like that to me. I'm jealous.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:43.580]  What does Andrew sound like to you?
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:46.120]  Uh, he hasn't come up yet, so I haven't thought about it.
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.060]  I can't wait.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.700]  Yeah, I had a slight issue with
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.640]  that retelling.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.480]  I mean, I can see that.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:54.620]  It was pretty word for word.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.280]  I just had a realization, that is, I'm disappointed
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.640]  in myself. I'm ashamed.
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.500]  I can't believe I've done this.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.240]  I did not, ever since
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.220]  we started the icy hot
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.060]  thing, with the balls and the ears
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.200]  and whatnot, and I remember I was iced up
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.000]  that episode.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.340]  Remember that one, a long time ago?
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:15.380]  I've applied icy hot to
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:17.200]  my ears, every single
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.220]  episode we've recorded, from
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:21.320]  that point forward, and I
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.420]  forgot today. The streak is
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:25.320]  over. You have not been very funny
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.980]  today. The streak is over.
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:28.860]  Wow.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.200]  Wow. I'm disappointed.
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:32.860]  It showed too, no offense.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:33.960]  Wow. Disappointed.
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:36.700]  How do you feel like it affected your performance?
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:39.060]  You know, I think it was fine.
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.040]  I think it was a solid performance by me.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.900]  I think it's on par with
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.940]  recent performances. We'll see what the audience
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:45.300]  says.
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.960]  Anyway, by the way, if you would like
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:49.900]  audience, if you want
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.000]  Andrew to continue icy
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.740]  hiding his ears before episodes, let him know.
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:56.940]  If you want me to continue writing the novelization
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.980]  of episode 135, let me know.
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:00.460]  I was really enjoying it,
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:02.960]  flexing my writing muscles, and I feel like
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.600]  I captured the true nature of f***face.
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:07.060]  And I guess it's about time for
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:09.140]  us to wrap up. Does anybody have anything else they want to cover
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.480]  before we end it?
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:13.140]  Didn't you say it took like 16 listens to get
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.040]  Oh, so annoying.
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.200]  I had to listen for that one page.
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:19.020]  I had to listen
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:20.920]  over and over and over and over
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:22.300]  again. It was a f***ing nightmare.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.640]  It would be very difficult to make a whole novel
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:27.400]  from a whole episode, but I would do it if there were
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.140]  enough demand. Please don't.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.500]  And tune in
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.220]  next week. Oh, did you guys have anything else?
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:35.100]  No. I think Eric had something.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:36.960]  You think Eric did?
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.000]  What did you want to say, Eric? Thanks for listening to
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.200]  the podcast. Follow us at
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.980]  f***facepod on Instagram and on Twitter,
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:45.020]  but that's the end of the episode. Goodbye. Yeah, there you go.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.760]  Tune in next week for cookbook... Nope, I already did it.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.680]  Shut up. Goodbye. Cookbook progress.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.340]  Make 2023 the year of lists.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.880]  Emily's sleep routine. We're gonna talk about how we
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.920]  should all work at the mall, just for fun. We're gonna talk
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.860]  about how I set a prime rib on fire. We're gonna
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.000]  talk about how we need to invent a new noodle.
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:01.140]  We're gonna talk about food teleportation.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.900]  We're gonna talk about the go-go Gerpler.
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.900]  We're gonna talk about a book. It took me three years
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.820]  to finish. We're gonna talk about action Bronson
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:09.080]  and music with drums and lions.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.620]  We're gonna talk about the mall
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.960]  being back, baby. And I
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.640]  got numbers to prove it. We're gonna talk
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.000]  about an idea I had for a show called
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.640]  F***face Catches a Game. We're gonna
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.780]  schedule Condorman. We're gonna talk about the
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:22.940]  Wheel of Suck. And Andrew had a new idea for
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.840]  a show as well. All next week
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.900]  where we also invent the human falcon
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.560]  cap for sleep. Bye-bye.
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:31.160]  Season five's gonna be fuckin' awesome.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.420]  Or six. Where's six?
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.380]  Six. Five was great.
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:36.200]  Six. Goddammit. I fucked up.
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:38.500]  Hey guys. Major League Fan Jack here
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.160]  with a look at next week's episode of
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.280]  F***face. Do seasons have episode
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.320]  limits? We get an update on Geoff's
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.480]  fridge. What the hell happened during
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.420]  Does It Do? The banana did not
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:50.320]  injure Geoff. What do you do
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.440]  with a used sofa? The boys enter
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.280]  the war zone. And once again
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.880]  Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.460]  All that and more on next week's episode of
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:12:59.040]  F***face.
