[00:15.360 --> 00:22.700]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast, number 140, season something,
[00:23.340 --> 00:29.360]  edition something, volume something. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me as always...
[00:29.360 --> 00:33.580]  Oh, Eric wants to ask a question. Eric, you have a question in the chat.
[00:33.700 --> 00:37.140]  Yeah, yeah, just real quick. Alongside Andrew Pantin and Gavin Frey,
[00:37.140 --> 00:43.860]  uh, we talked about having Nick, like, in the background for this stuff. Are we doing that or
[00:43.860 --> 00:50.340]  not? Yeah, sure. Okay, okay, but I mean, like, is he unmuting and laughing so you guys can hear him
[00:50.340 --> 00:58.260]  or is he just adding it into post later? I don't know. That's a laugh track that he peppers in
[00:58.260 --> 01:04.800]  whatever. Yeah, I feel like post is funnier. Right, so you don't hear it when you record.
[01:04.800 --> 01:08.920]  Yeah, I see, I see. Right, that's why I'm asking, just for clarification,
[01:09.280 --> 01:12.500]  because I feel like we never landed on it. We all just went, that's a good idea.
[01:12.620 --> 01:16.060]  Let's try it out. That's such an interesting question because we could potentially have a
[01:16.060 --> 01:21.180]  joke that bombs and then in the episode Nick's cracking up. That's what I hope for now.
[01:21.800 --> 01:28.620]  Nick just said in the chat that he was also confused. Okay, so episode 140 is going to be
[01:28.620 --> 01:33.260]  the first episode to feature Nick laughing if and when it happens. This could also be
[01:33.260 --> 01:39.540]  just a dog shit episode where Nick isn't tickled by anything. We have no idea and
[01:39.540 --> 01:44.280]  none of us will know until we listen to the episode when you guys do. I also like the
[01:44.280 --> 01:49.260]  idea of this happening without us hearing it because he could be wearing the monkey mask
[01:49.260 --> 01:54.640]  and I feel like laughing in the mask would be very obvious and the people listening will be
[01:54.640 --> 01:59.020]  like he's in the mask and we'll have no idea. I think either way he shouldn't be near the bike.
[02:00.540 --> 02:04.660]  It should sound like he's in the corner of the room. Now that we're talking about Nick like he
[02:04.660 --> 02:09.880]  isn't here when he very clearly is. Nick, are you wearing the monkey mask today? No, I'm not
[02:09.880 --> 02:14.460]  wearing the monkey mask today. Have you worn it yet? Not yet. Did we miss it? Okay, okay,
[02:14.520 --> 02:17.180]  so I'll make sure. So that's still going. That's still going. It's still live. We still got time.
[02:17.200 --> 02:23.420]  That's mind-blowing that Geoff used up his guess on this one. That's fine. Does he only get one?
[02:23.460 --> 02:26.380]  I just want to know. Were there rules to this? I don't remember the rules. I think it's more
[02:26.380 --> 02:29.960]  interesting if we only get one guess until everyone is guessed and then we get all the
[02:29.960 --> 02:35.520]  likes back. I like that you come up with this rule after I guess. What in the motherfucking heck,
[02:35.720 --> 02:40.740]  dude? From now. Oh, wow. Gavin, no, Gavin, I'm with you. It doesn't make sense because then
[02:40.740 --> 02:46.400]  we could just say it every episode. There would have to be a limit. First of all, I agree with
[02:46.400 --> 02:51.160]  you. Second of all, you just absolutely Gregged it. You Gregged it. When I went back, when I did
[02:51.160 --> 02:54.680]  the Jeopardy rules but didn't vocalize it, if that's how it was in my head, you can't just add
[02:54.680 --> 03:01.320]  rules after they played. You can't do that. I think Geoff gets one more guess. But going forward,
[03:01.860 --> 03:07.180]  you get one guess until everybody guesses. Okay, that's fair. Nick wants to know, Nick very
[03:07.180 --> 03:12.000]  quietly in the chat wants to know when he has until. Do you guys remember? I don't remember.
[03:12.140 --> 03:16.640]  I think maybe the rest of this year. Let's say by the end of this year. Yeah, okay. Calendar year.
[03:16.640 --> 03:25.660]  It's pretty, uh, it's pretty open for January. End of 2023. Okay, got it. That's now, I know we
[03:25.660 --> 03:29.860]  had settled on something before, but now that's the official rule. End of 2023, everybody gets
[03:29.860 --> 03:33.840]  one guess from this point on. Realistically, we're gonna forget this and I think this would be really
[03:33.840 --> 03:38.960]  funny if we remember in like seven months and he did it four months prior, like it's already over
[03:38.960 --> 03:43.100]  by the time we remember. Or there's just a bunch of really muffled laughs for one episode and we don't
[03:43.460 --> 03:49.740]  wait. That's what I want. I'd love to have that. I'm not suggesting, I actually, I hope you don't
[03:49.740 --> 03:53.460]  do this, but this would be a really funny time for you to put that mask on because nobody's
[03:53.460 --> 03:56.880]  going to ask you for the rest of the episode. I guarantee you it has to start at the beginning.
[03:57.600 --> 04:02.480]  I can't do it in the middle. Another rule. Okay, I think we've got to have it on. It's got to have
[04:02.480 --> 04:07.960]  it on at the beginning of the show from from when I do the intro. Everybody gets one guess 2023.
[04:09.380 --> 04:15.100]  And if Nick sneaks it past us, what does he win? I don't, I don't remember. Nick, what did you win?
[04:15.480 --> 04:20.400]  I don't think we ever came up with it. I don't think we did. We'll give him 100% chocolate.
[04:20.820 --> 04:25.820]  I got a, oh that's nice, 100% chocolate. I have a giant pink port-a-potty I could give you.
[04:26.220 --> 04:30.120]  You have to, that's a great gift. You have to deliver it home yourself, but you're more than
[04:30.120 --> 04:34.640]  welcome to it. I will say, and this is maybe leading into the first topic of today that I want
[04:34.640 --> 04:38.700]  to know about, you got a fridge. I did have the thought the day that you were getting your fridge,
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.580]  I should have sent you a fridge as well. I missed out on a huge opportunity. I didn't, I don't know
[04:45.580 --> 04:50.200]  if I would have went with the tiniest fridge I could find or like a big cheap one maybe. I don't
[04:50.200 --> 04:54.900]  know, but I had the thought. Phenomenal. I needed to send to you. I missed out. I should have sent you a fridge.
[04:55.380 --> 05:01.400]  That's a very funny idea. I do indeed have a new fridge and it's funny you say that as well because
[05:02.940 --> 05:08.380]  Aaron Romero in Ecom was like, he made a joke. He was like, I guess we need a fridge magnet
[05:08.380 --> 05:12.600]  now that Geoff's got a new fridge. And I thought, what would a fridge magnet, what would our fridge
[05:12.600 --> 05:17.060]  magnet be? And I thought the funniest thing we could do is make a fridge magnet of my fridge.
[05:18.280 --> 05:21.300]  And I thought, wow, that's probably been done 1 million times. So I googled it.
[05:21.640 --> 05:26.600]  I, to my knowledge, there does not exist a fridge magnet of a fridge. You can find one
[05:26.600 --> 05:37.760]  anywhere on the Internet. So there has to be a hole in that market for their fridge or even just a
[05:37.760 --> 05:42.240]  drawing of a fridge on a fridge. It just doesn't exist. You can't do it. It's not out there.
[05:42.340 --> 05:47.600]  Nick wants to see your fridge. I don't have a picture of it. Let me, well, maybe I do, Nick.
[05:47.660 --> 05:52.560]  Maybe I do. Let me look. Let me look. All right. He did an Instagram live yesterday where the fridge
[05:52.560 --> 06:00.200]  was heavily featured. Oh, did he? Yes. Here's what I can do. I can send you guys. I'm going to
[06:00.200 --> 06:05.080]  send you guys a picture there. OK, OK, I got this. All right. Please don't be too powerful.
[06:06.900 --> 06:10.840]  I got distracted with I should have prepped this already. I got distracted with other photos. I'd
[06:10.840 --> 06:13.820]  be honest with you. So much has happened in my life in the last couple of days. I forgot about
[06:13.820 --> 06:23.580]  the fridge. Here is me in the fridge hole. That's a big hole. Yeah, I agree. I agree.
[06:23.980 --> 06:29.100]  Takes a very, very specific, very expensive fridge. Here's one. Here's me. This is better.
[06:29.460 --> 06:34.220]  This is me flexing in the fridge hole. Oh, did you do a little Sam Fisher in there to prop
[06:34.220 --> 06:39.140]  yourself between the walls? No, I didn't think that. If I had tried that, I would have knocked
[06:39.140 --> 06:47.260]  you out. I'd have a fridge and no shelves. And here is a fully installed, fully functioning
[06:47.760 --> 06:53.200]  fridge. I'll be honest, whenever you have a big problem in your life, like the shelves going up,
[06:53.380 --> 06:58.000]  you know, a fridge coming in, it's always so funny. And then I see the final result and it's
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.220]  just beautiful. Look at that thing. It's a beautiful fridge. Yeah, I'm very lucky. And I got
[07:02.220 --> 07:08.120]  to say zero problems. I was so ready for things to go so wrong. It looked like things were headed
[07:08.120 --> 07:12.460]  in a bad direction because when they pulled the fridge out and they tried to tip it over,
[07:13.300 --> 07:17.420]  the fridge was too tall for my kitchen. Like they couldn't tip it over because it was hitting the
[07:17.420 --> 07:21.800]  ceiling. But they figured out they could take some parts off. And then we had to like slide
[07:21.800 --> 07:25.220]  it into the living room, which has a slightly taller ceiling. And then they were able to tip
[07:25.220 --> 07:29.620]  it there. That was the closest thing to a problem we had in and out. Probably took him an hour and
[07:29.620 --> 07:35.720]  a half. Lovely dudes. And the lights work in the freezer and the fridge part. It has a water
[07:35.720 --> 07:40.720]  dispenser and it makes non rusty ice. It does everything you could ever hope a fridge can do.
[07:41.380 --> 07:46.260]  So the dispensers on the inside. Yeah, it's on the inside, like on the sidewall.
[07:46.800 --> 07:52.920]  Yeah, it's pretty cool. It actually it actually there's a learning curve to it. You have to you
[07:52.920 --> 07:58.080]  have to remove the water your cup in the right way or you will shoot water across the fridge.
[07:58.640 --> 08:00.940]  That just sounds fun. Yeah, it's like a bonus.
[08:02.620 --> 08:08.960]  That's ridiculously large. Like it just looks sturdy. It looks thick. Like if Indiana Jones
[08:08.960 --> 08:13.720]  would have climbed into that fridge when the nook went off, that would have felt believable.
[08:14.080 --> 08:19.200]  That feels like if a tank shoots that fridge, I don't think it does anything to that. Dude,
[08:19.560 --> 08:24.940]  I stainless. I could I could easily comfortably fit in that fridge. It's so it's so even though
[08:24.940 --> 08:29.680]  it fits the exact same footprint of the other fridge, it's way, way, way roomier for some
[08:29.680 --> 08:34.380]  reason. And the only way I could even think of improving this fridge as I'm looking at it right
[08:34.380 --> 08:41.560]  now is if it had a magnet of itself on it. It's the front door magnetic. I have no idea. Probably
[08:41.560 --> 08:46.460]  not. Because because mine isn't. I tried to put a magnet on mine. My last one wasn't either.
[08:46.640 --> 08:51.060]  I have a feeling that if we were to buy a fridge magnet of my fridge for my fridge, it would never
[08:51.060 --> 08:56.060]  work. Maybe you could come with an adhesive to stick your fridge magnet to the fridge.
[08:56.760 --> 08:59.120]  Like fridge magnet sticker.
[09:01.540 --> 09:04.080]  Like a sticker of a fridge magnet. Yeah.
[09:05.800 --> 09:11.240]  You want people to stick a sticker on their refrigerators? Well, if the magnet doesn't
[09:11.240 --> 09:15.780]  work, what are they going to do? You got to provide alternate solutions. We're about solving
[09:15.780 --> 09:20.820]  problems here. Do you think there are more fridges that can't that like you can't stick a magnet to
[09:20.820 --> 09:25.020]  or more fridges that you can stick a magnet to? I think we just give people the option. We sell a
[09:25.020 --> 09:30.320]  fridge magnet and a fridge magnet sticker depending on the magneticness. Maybe maybe maybe they just
[09:30.320 --> 09:36.060]  come together. Yeah, it's a bundle deal. Super cheap bundle. OK. And it's and it's a magnet
[09:36.060 --> 09:41.580]  or a sticker of Geoff's fridge. I guess it seems to be where we're going. I mean, it's a beautiful
[09:41.580 --> 09:46.040]  fridge. I was kind of against initially, but that is a great looking fridge. Why were you against
[09:46.040 --> 09:50.000]  my fridge? No, not against your fridge. I was against the idea of a fridge magnet that looked
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.640]  like a fridge. Like I just didn't in my head. Like it was it was funny, but I know it was great.
[09:53.760 --> 09:58.500]  But there's a beautiful looking fridge. It was like a five out of ten idea. I'm not saying it
[09:58.500 --> 10:01.840]  was a bad idea, necessarily. I just I didn't, you know, it didn't pop in my head immediately
[10:01.840 --> 10:06.540]  like some of the other things we've talked about before. But I'm on board. Am I right in thinking
[10:06.540 --> 10:11.340]  that this fridge is a month early? Yeah, you are. Yeah. Supposed to be there in February. You got
[10:11.340 --> 10:18.580]  it a month early. It's conspicuously early and interesting. Like I I was last week I was sitting
[10:18.580 --> 10:22.600]  in the house and I was kind of just like it just popped into my head. And I thought I'm about a
[10:22.600 --> 10:26.220]  month out of getting that fridge. And I started to get nervous. I was like, you know, that was a lot
[10:26.220 --> 10:30.360]  of money. I haven't spoken to these people in like 10 months. Let me call them and just make sure
[10:30.360 --> 10:35.420]  there are no problems. Like this is the moment I'll find out that my fridge fell off of a boat
[10:36.180 --> 10:41.500]  in the ocean or whatever. Right. And it's like, yeah, you got a fridge, but it's at the bottom of
[10:41.500 --> 10:47.060]  the Pacific Ocean and we don't know how to get it up or whatever. And Harrison Ford's inside it.
[10:47.060 --> 10:51.280]  Yeah. And Harrison Ford's inside it. And so I called them. And when I called the lady,
[10:51.300 --> 10:56.100]  remembered me easily. Like instantly. She was like, oh, I remember you. Yeah. You bought the
[10:56.100 --> 10:59.220]  so-and-so fridge. I was like, yes, ma'am, I did. She's a little older. And she was like,
[10:59.220 --> 11:03.580]  I was just thinking of you. And I was like, oh, I'm thinking of my fridge right now. And she was
[11:03.580 --> 11:08.620]  like, did I? She's like, I was going to call you. It just came in yesterday. I was like, are you
[11:08.620 --> 11:13.440]  serious? She was like, I was just sitting here thinking about letting you know. So for all I
[11:13.440 --> 11:18.140]  know, the fridge has been there for six months and they just didn't... It feels weird saying you
[11:18.140 --> 11:22.260]  got a fridge early that you waited two years for. Like that doesn't... A year. Like I understand
[11:22.260 --> 11:26.580]  what you're saying. No, I guess I did wait two years for it. It felt endless, your wait for it.
[11:26.580 --> 11:32.940]  Yeah. So for it to show up a month early doesn't feel like early. It's wild also that like it was
[11:32.940 --> 11:37.980]  such a big thing for so long and now it's in and it works and I don't think about it. And I will
[11:37.980 --> 11:42.600]  say when I come home every night, I say or whenever I come home, I say hi to the fridge because I don't
[11:42.600 --> 11:46.040]  have a dog to say hi to anymore. But other than that, it's just like I just it's just like a
[11:46.040 --> 11:52.500]  just part of life now. It's just like I've always had this fridge. It was very sad, but we just
[11:52.500 --> 11:58.940]  passed through. I was hit with sadness and it was also like equally funny and it just cancelled
[11:58.940 --> 12:04.360]  out to be like a... Does the fridge have a name? I don't really want it to laugh. Or did you just say what's up fridge?
[12:04.840 --> 12:09.480]  I say hello fridge. Okay. Yeah, I haven't given it a name. That seems weird. So I mean...
[12:11.180 --> 12:14.660]  Saying hello to it in replacement of a dog. I mean, you're already in a weird territory.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.020]  But it's as much money as I spent on that fridge. I should be able to say hello to it as
[12:20.020 --> 12:25.780]  much as I want to. It should say hello back. Yeah, it really should. I need to know if you've put a new
[12:25.780 --> 12:29.800]  Cosmic Crispin because that's I feel like the real test of differences between fridges. Have you
[12:29.800 --> 12:34.300]  have you got a new one in there for a year from now? I did and I filmed a video of it. Oh, you did?
[12:34.640 --> 12:39.400]  Yeah, I filmed a video. I definitely I put one in there that day. I think I filmed a video doing
[12:39.400 --> 12:43.720]  it, but I put the but I have the apple in. I can send you. No, not in a bag, right? Like we're not
[12:43.720 --> 12:50.380]  in a bag, just out on its own. I don't know if I took a photo of that or if I just the video.
[12:51.060 --> 12:56.200]  Um, yeah, I don't seem to have a photo of it. But uh, but I can take one, which is fine. Also,
[12:56.260 --> 12:59.460]  the last thing before we move on for fridges, unless you have more more to talk about.
[12:59.660 --> 13:04.100]  No, I didn't even mean to talk about the fridge. You brought it up. I'm not. Well, I was curious
[13:04.100 --> 13:08.180]  because it was a big deal. We're all excited. And because it's you and no disrespect to you, Geoff,
[13:08.180 --> 13:12.680]  we expected your house to somehow burn down in the process of you getting a fridge. Everything
[13:12.680 --> 13:18.920]  goes wrong always, as did I. Yes. But if you have to move the fridge for some reason, you have the
[13:18.920 --> 13:25.860]  whole if you could duplicate the pose from the Jet Li black black mask poster, that would make me
[13:25.860 --> 13:31.340]  really happy. That's my one request. If you do that, you can do legs both sides and like cool
[13:31.340 --> 13:35.920]  action pose. I'd love that. I'll do that. Yeah, I'll do that. And then I'll send you the picture
[13:35.920 --> 13:42.620]  with just like my shins going into two pieces of wood and the cabinet doors open and my feet
[13:42.620 --> 13:52.740]  dangling on the inside. Me not being able to get out and crying. Oh, that'd be great. You just make
[13:52.740 --> 13:58.660]  me want it more. I can't wait for this. So what's the next thing now? Have you got anything else
[13:58.660 --> 14:03.020]  that's waiting to arrive or are you just going to wait for the next thing to break? Oh, well,
[14:03.020 --> 14:09.180]  I do have a funny story that I haven't told you guys yet. Boy, we are getting off on tan. We have
[14:09.180 --> 14:14.740]  a lot to talk about today. We have to talk about does it do. But but first, I did buy a new sofa.
[14:15.560 --> 14:21.200]  I don't know if I told you guys, but like, you know, Henry, sweet, sweet Henry, he he lost his
[14:21.200 --> 14:26.460]  bladder control at the end there. And so he peed on the sofa a lot. And it was he had sweet little
[14:26.460 --> 14:31.680]  little happy, clean pee. It wasn't terrible. And I cleaned it up every day. But my front my sofa
[14:31.680 --> 14:36.680]  cushions were like in my front yard for about six months straight, like in the daytime in the sun,
[14:36.820 --> 14:41.760]  just baked, like just being cleaned and vacuumed out like almost every day. And so we were we
[14:41.760 --> 14:44.740]  wanted to get a new sofa, but we thought, well, we'll just wait till the dogs go because there's
[14:44.740 --> 14:53.200]  no point. And so when Henry, when Henry went to puppy puppy dog heaven, a couple like about a
[14:53.200 --> 14:56.940]  month later, we went and we decided like now it's time to buy the sofa, it'll probably take forever
[14:56.940 --> 15:01.880]  to get in if the fridge is any indication. So let's go buy a sofa. So we went and bought a sofa
[15:02.540 --> 15:11.840]  at this place in the domain called interior define. Bought a just a nice sofa. And they said,
[15:11.960 --> 15:17.140]  you'll have it in May. We're like, that fucking sucks. So but three months after we get the fridge,
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.300]  we'll get a sofa. At least we're on the clock now, you know, so they are used by
[15:22.380 --> 15:28.800]  Williams flanoma. No, I don't think so. But they are owned by somebody else because not too long
[15:28.800 --> 15:33.500]  after we ordered the sofa and they told us they were very clear this isn't coming until May.
[15:33.680 --> 15:39.020]  We got a letter like a form email from them that was like, we are so sorry about the delays with
[15:39.020 --> 15:42.980]  your sofa. And they could tell it was like sent to a lot of people. And they're like, we are doing
[15:42.980 --> 15:47.040]  everything in our power to get it to you on time. And we're like, yeah, well, you told us May. It's
[15:47.040 --> 15:54.220]  December. What do we care? Then Emily saw a Reddit thread about people not getting sofas
[15:54.220 --> 16:00.140]  from a company they bought. Turns out this interior defined company went bankrupt right
[16:00.140 --> 16:08.280]  after we bought this fucking sofa. Oh, no. And nobody's getting their sofas. So then
[16:09.460 --> 16:13.920]  we're like in limbo. We're like in sofa limbo. Then they release a statement recently that was
[16:13.920 --> 16:21.060]  like, listen, want to let you guys know every single sofa purchased after December 16th, 2022
[16:21.060 --> 16:28.280]  will be delivered. And I'm like, cool. We bought our sofa in November. What does that mean? I think
[16:28.280 --> 16:33.640]  it means we are fucked and we might have to like enter into some class action lawsuit to get our
[16:33.640 --> 16:38.000]  fucking money back because they went bankrupt and got bought by another company. And now this
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.300]  other company is determining if they're even going to continue making these products or what to do
[16:42.300 --> 16:47.820]  with it or dismantle the company. So anyway, I'm in this weird I'm in this weird holding pattern
[16:47.820 --> 16:54.540]  where I bought a sofa for 2400 bucks or whatever that I don't know if I have or will ever get.
[16:54.800 --> 16:59.040]  Nobody can tell me yes for sure. Nobody can tell me no for sure. Nobody can tell me much of
[16:59.040 --> 17:03.860]  anything. Honestly, everything I read is conflicting and I don't really have extra money to throw out
[17:03.860 --> 17:09.000]  and buy another sofa. I also don't want to buy another sofa so that in May this sofa shows up
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.000]  and suddenly I got extra sofa problems. I also don't want to sit around and wait till May for this sofa
[17:13.000 --> 17:17.360]  not to show up to then begin the sofa buying process. I also don't want to pop down another
[17:17.360 --> 17:21.340]  two grand on a sofa when I'm already out two grand on the first sofa. I'd like to get the money back.
[17:21.520 --> 17:25.900]  So I don't know what the fuck to do. We're having this it's like sofa gate. I don't know what to do
[17:25.900 --> 17:32.140]  about sofa. Very confused right now. What happens if you like charge back a credit card payment to a
[17:32.140 --> 17:37.280]  company that doesn't exist anymore? I don't know. Some people had been trying that and had
[17:37.280 --> 17:43.020]  limited success and other people had no success and so that is something that I might do is talk
[17:43.020 --> 17:48.720]  to the bank and just see if I can issue a charge back. But it sounds like it's because of the
[17:48.720 --> 17:53.520]  length of time and stuff and I don't know. We'll see. I'm gonna get a sofa. I will have a sofa
[17:53.520 --> 17:56.980]  someday. I don't know if I'm gonna have the sofa I bought. I don't know if the people that I bought
[17:56.980 --> 18:01.700]  it from are gonna make it or the people that bought them are gonna make it or what. But someday I will
[18:01.700 --> 18:06.720]  have another sofa. What you don't have? For some reason I thought you had the sofa and this was
[18:06.720 --> 18:12.100]  just part of the journey of you getting it. You never received? I thought you have a sofa. No,
[18:12.340 --> 18:17.940]  I'm supposed to get it in May. I completely, I don't know why my brain thought that you had a
[18:17.940 --> 18:21.440]  sofa. For some reason I just decided you had one and you were telling us about the process.
[18:22.520 --> 18:27.920]  This is, this is, just real quick, other people on this podcast, he's insane?
[18:29.540 --> 18:34.820]  Yes, yeah. It sounds like it. I mean I just don't know how you could listen to all of that and be
[18:35.360 --> 18:40.680]  so glad you got your sofa, man. Not only was I, I was so lost in the woods, I was, while you were
[18:40.680 --> 18:43.820]  saying the story, Geoff, I thought, well you shouldn't have said you already got the sofa at
[18:43.820 --> 18:48.600]  the beginning because this really takes the wind out of the sails. It doesn't. There was a whole
[18:48.600 --> 18:54.380]  bit about how the quote was that it may show up in May and now it may not. But I thought he somehow
[18:54.380 --> 18:59.480]  got it, I think because he got the fridge early, I somehow connected that the sofa came early,
[18:59.740 --> 19:04.580]  I don't know, for some reason my head, I don't know what happened there. I think I spaced out
[19:04.580 --> 19:10.640]  a minute and I just changed what you were saying and then I was under the belief of what I thought
[19:10.640 --> 19:16.000]  and not anything you had said. That made no sense. I apologize. It's totally fine. I don't listen to
[19:16.000 --> 19:21.460]  half the stuff y'all say either. It's totally fine, I get it. You kept saying, I was sitting
[19:21.460 --> 19:24.880]  on, you kept using that as like a phrase and I was like, you're not sitting on anything,
[19:25.100 --> 19:28.620]  it sounds like you don't have a sofa, you're waiting on that sofa. Maybe that's where I got
[19:28.620 --> 19:32.180]  lost. I am waiting on this fucking sofa. Or for somebody to tell me... So do I need to send you
[19:32.180 --> 19:36.700]  a sofa? Is that what we're getting to? Is this a problem? I don't know. I don't know. I really,
[19:36.820 --> 19:41.280]  I don't know where to go from here. I think Emily and I are going to try to solve it this weekend.
[19:41.580 --> 19:44.980]  I don't know if I need to go out and buy a new sofa, although I'm saving up for a wedding this
[19:44.980 --> 19:52.600]  year. I don't have a ton of extra money to throw around. I don't know if I, like none of my emails
[19:52.600 --> 19:56.360]  are getting responded to by this company. So I just, I just don't know. Hands are in the air
[19:56.360 --> 20:01.420]  right now. I'm one of the apparently millions of people across America who bought interior
[20:01.420 --> 20:07.420]  defined products and are kind of fucked. So we'll see. It's crazy that we've got sofa money coming
[20:07.420 --> 20:11.240]  in. They still went under. Yeah, I know, right? It's like, it's like I know they were getting
[20:11.240 --> 20:17.420]  some money in because I gave them a healthy check. I wonder when they folded, like what
[20:17.420 --> 20:22.240]  the distance was between you making that purchase and when they went out, when they lost all their
[20:22.240 --> 20:30.140]  money. It was pretty, it was like weeks. Weeks? It was like weeks. That's crazy. Yeah, it was
[20:30.140 --> 20:35.720]  pretty insane. We had a little filming session the other day, didn't we? We did. We had a little filming
[20:35.720 --> 20:43.020]  session the other day. And man, I gotta say, so we filmed the first two episodes of Does It Do
[20:43.020 --> 20:48.800]  back to back on the same day, kind of as a test. A lot, it feels like forever ago, but Eric, was it
[20:48.800 --> 20:53.920]  like maybe September or October? Yeah, yeah, I think, I think it was more like August, but yeah, something
[20:53.920 --> 21:00.080]  like that. And it was phenomenal. I had a lot of fun. Gav, I think you did too. And we really
[21:00.080 --> 21:05.920]  liked it. We put those two episodes out. Then we had to go on hiatus for a while. And in that
[21:05.920 --> 21:12.160]  process, we had a meeting to talk about what the remaining six episodes would be, because we were
[21:12.160 --> 21:16.520]  trying to do an eight episode season. And I thought it was pretty necessary, because one of the things
[21:16.520 --> 21:22.600]  I learned in the process of making those first two episodes is that preparation, a lot of the idea of
[21:22.600 --> 21:27.460]  it is to come up with funny stuff on the fly. But preparation is key, because you need ingredients
[21:27.460 --> 21:33.440]  and things to do with these products. And so we had a really, really, really, really good
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.600]  planning session, Gavin, not Gavin wasn't there, sorry, Eric, and Andrew and I. And we wrote down
[21:39.600 --> 21:43.700]  a bunch of stuff, came up with a bunch of awesome ideas to round out the final six episodes for
[21:43.700 --> 21:48.880]  those products. And I was like, more excited than ever to film it. And then we didn't film it until
[21:48.880 --> 21:53.740]  yesterday. And so all of those ideas just went away. Like they're on a spreadsheet that Eric
[21:53.740 --> 21:58.580]  showed me. But you know, after a while, you lose connection to all of that, right? And so I went
[21:58.580 --> 22:03.480]  back to not wanting to record, I wanted to make it less now than ever before. Because now I just
[22:03.480 --> 22:07.100]  looked at a bunch of props that I didn't know what to do with. And we were talking about how
[22:07.500 --> 22:11.200]  face seems to happen in all these different phases. And we go like all in and then we do it
[22:11.200 --> 22:16.560]  and then we're straight on to the next thing. And it felt like, does it do is very like last phase
[22:16.560 --> 22:21.040]  or a couple of phases ago. So we're both just like, wow, I'm just feeling rusty and like couldn't
[22:21.040 --> 22:24.920]  remember anything. Like Geoff was just stood over a bunch of buckets of stuff like, what's this?
[22:25.180 --> 22:31.040]  What's this for? Because Eric wasn't there, Tyler was like, I don't know. I mean, it was on the list.
[22:31.620 --> 22:36.500]  Yeah, Tyler was producing and he did a phenomenal job. But he was only able to do what
[22:36.500 --> 22:39.820]  we gave him, right? So we're like, here's the stuff to buy. He goes and he buys it, but he
[22:39.820 --> 22:44.280]  doesn't know what we're planning to do with it. And so Gavin's right, he kept referring to it as
[22:44.280 --> 22:50.620]  a production from two phases ago. And it totally felt like that. But then I walked around RT and
[22:50.620 --> 22:55.100]  I just started grabbing shit that looked funny and kind of cobbled together a rough idea. I don't
[22:55.100 --> 23:00.100]  think any of it was as good as maybe the stuff that we came up with that day, Andrew, that
[23:00.620 --> 23:08.400]  is just lost to the annals of time. But then we sat, we got in front of the camera and I'll be
[23:08.400 --> 23:13.700]  honest with you guys, I have hit a point where I want to appear on camera less often, way less often.
[23:14.600 --> 23:20.100]  Uh, I'm really, really into doing the audio podcast. I really love that. Uh, I've even
[23:20.100 --> 23:23.280]  resisted turning this into a video podcast. I just don't want to be on video anymore. I don't
[23:23.280 --> 23:27.080]  know what it is. Just a phase in my life. I'm just over it. And so I was kind of not jazzed
[23:27.080 --> 23:33.800]  about that as well. And, uh, and then the second we got started, I don't know. It was like a light
[23:33.800 --> 23:38.820]  switch turned on and it became, no, it wasn't a light switch. It was a fun switch turned on
[23:38.820 --> 23:43.120]  and it became instantly the most fun I have ever had in my entire life. And I don't think
[23:43.120 --> 23:47.120]  that's hyperbole, Gavin. What do you think? Yeah, it went from something that we were talking
[23:47.120 --> 23:51.460]  about before of just like, you, you weren't that into it. And I was like, Oh, why don't we just
[23:51.460 --> 23:55.400]  not do it? It's not too late. We could just not bother and just say that it was only two episodes.
[23:55.700 --> 24:00.400]  And then we finished episode one of that shoot and we were like, okay, so how do we make like
[24:00.400 --> 24:08.900]  25 more of these? Gavin at one point turned to me and he said, how do we only do this for the
[24:08.900 --> 24:13.100]  rest of our lives? And I was like, I don't know, dude, but I'm right there with you. I just
[24:13.620 --> 24:19.580]  I've never had more fun. And each episode was more fun. And I think better than the previous
[24:19.580 --> 24:25.180]  one. Like we were just like building this head of steam and just getting funnier and better as we
[24:25.180 --> 24:30.120]  went. And I think one of the things is going to be cool for the season when people watch it. Well,
[24:30.280 --> 24:34.860]  at least the it was supposed to be six episodes. It's five. I guess we'll explain that.
[24:35.680 --> 24:39.580]  I think I think we might be able to get this. Well, we'll see if we can get the sixth. Well,
[24:39.580 --> 24:44.240]  might be five and a half episodes. We got five. Well, we'll see. Yeah, five and a half,
[24:44.380 --> 24:47.760]  five episodes in the beginning of a sixth episode. We'll see.
[24:50.780 --> 24:55.080]  Fuck, I forgot what I was where I was going with this. I got lost in my head.
[24:55.520 --> 25:01.300]  As the episodes progress, you guys show progression on what you're wearing, etc.
[25:01.980 --> 25:04.880]  You are absolutely that's exactly where I was going with this, Eric. Thank you. This old
[25:04.880 --> 25:09.080]  dumb brain is getting dumber. Yeah, I think it'll be fun for the audience to see us becoming
[25:09.080 --> 25:16.180]  increasingly disheveled and gross, because it was one of the grossest things I've ever
[25:16.180 --> 25:23.900]  participated in. I threw up a couple times. Gavin threw up a couple times. It was one of the later
[25:23.900 --> 25:30.260]  ones. We were making it and I threw up and I just thought, man, this was just way too gross. We
[25:30.260 --> 25:34.280]  might not be able to put this one out. And then the next one we filmed, we definitely can't put
[25:34.280 --> 25:40.240]  out. So that means we have to put out the gross one. Wait, how many did you film? How many were
[25:40.240 --> 25:46.120]  shot? We shot five and a half. OK, you filmed five and a half episodes that day? Yeah.
[25:47.580 --> 25:53.400]  Siri. Oh, my God. I wasn't sure if you guys got past one based on. So I haven't I've been
[25:53.400 --> 25:56.520]  avoiding any information about this because I wanted to hear about on the show. But I have seen
[25:56.520 --> 26:03.740]  a few photos and the photos I've seen. There's noodles all over a desk for some reason. Geoff
[26:03.740 --> 26:09.520]  is covered in pink shit for some reason, like an explosion clearly happened. I think something
[26:09.520 --> 26:15.820]  got launched into a wall at some point. From what I can tell, I can't decipher what happened there.
[26:16.100 --> 26:20.360]  And then I've I've heard other things that were alarming that made me think that
[26:20.360 --> 26:28.960]  that there might even be a physical injury of some kind. Well, I should I go to the beginning of that
[26:28.960 --> 26:36.820]  where we were. Gavin, you and I were supposed to play Warzone on Tuesday. When did you guys film
[26:36.820 --> 26:40.980]  that? Tuesday? It doesn't really matter. Anyway, Tuesday, we're supposed to play. We're going to do
[26:40.980 --> 26:47.020]  a Tourzone Tuesday. Yeah. And I texted a follow up being like, hey, we still doing this. And you
[26:47.020 --> 26:52.300]  didn't you didn't reply. And then Geoff texted me if I had heard anything about does it do.
[26:52.360 --> 26:56.240]  And I explained that, no, I was waiting because it seems crazy what I've seen. I've got a lot of
[26:56.240 --> 27:02.300]  questions about it. And also Gavin's ditched me. And then Geoff brought up that he felt he was
[27:02.300 --> 27:07.240]  ditched because we played the three of us played on Friday, had one of the best times I've had
[27:07.240 --> 27:12.580]  playing games in a long time. It was great. It was so much fun. Same. Then then Gavin and I played
[27:12.580 --> 27:18.440]  Saturday. Geoff was not part of that. So Geoff felt ditched. I was invited to play. They said, let's
[27:18.440 --> 27:22.140]  play again this weekend. And I said, absolutely. I definitely want to play with you guys this
[27:22.140 --> 27:25.920]  weekend. I'm very excited. Let's play. And then I never heard from either of you again.
[27:26.480 --> 27:32.960]  In fairness to Gavin, who scheduled this, your response was, I'm available this weekend and
[27:32.960 --> 27:38.360]  every day until the end of time. You gave a very large availability window just because
[27:38.360 --> 27:42.020]  like, I think there's room. And I should point out, I invited Geoff to tonight's
[27:42.020 --> 27:47.920]  potential session and he's busy. The one night I'm going out to a comedy show that my friend
[27:47.920 --> 27:53.100]  invited me to. Well, anyway, Geoff and I were going back and forth and I said, I think Gavin's
[27:53.100 --> 27:57.640]  ignoring me. I think he's ditched me again. He's not replying to my things. He said he'd do this.
[27:57.760 --> 28:02.740]  Geoff said he felt ditched. I said, do you want to play Warzone right now? And we could figure
[28:02.740 --> 28:06.980]  out why Gavin hates us. We could just play, you and I. It wasn't supposed to happen. And then Geoff
[28:06.980 --> 28:11.580]  at first was, yes, or it was tomorrow. I said, reschedule for tomorrow. And Geoff said, yeah.
[28:11.840 --> 28:17.040]  And then he changed his tune to actually, no, wait, I might... something happened that doesn't do. I
[28:17.040 --> 28:22.220]  might not physically be capable of playing video games for a while. I'll need to get back to you
[28:22.220 --> 28:30.760]  on that one. What happened? I think I'm off games for a few days. You should post that picture,
[28:31.160 --> 28:36.940]  Geoff. Was that the last episode you filmed? When did this happen? Yeah, episode six. Here,
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.880]  I'm going to look for this photo. Gavin, you fill in for me. I got to go back through your text to
[28:40.880 --> 28:46.840]  find it. Was it obvious whatever happened, Gavin, that he had like a legit injury potentially?
[28:47.380 --> 28:53.620]  When the moment happened? All right, here we go. I got it. So I gave you a way to fill.
[28:55.900 --> 29:02.480]  He's not helping at all. Okay. Geoff just posted a photo. It's like, is that blood or ketchup?
[29:03.880 --> 29:09.940]  That blood? What do you think? I think that's blood. That's blood. That's a little bit of a
[29:09.940 --> 29:19.900]  lot of blood. It looks almost like cake flour or like chips of some kind. I'll be honest with you.
[29:20.180 --> 29:29.380]  It might be banana. I don't know. It's banana, yeah. I will say I discovered a new use for
[29:29.380 --> 29:35.510]  bananas. And I think Gavin did too. That is a phenomenal use for bananas. Bananas are the
[29:35.510 --> 29:41.730]  ultimate palate cleanser. It's Bovril Canceller. It's salad dressing canceller. When you make a
[29:42.590 --> 29:50.230]  frozen salad dressing popsicle or you try to mix instant coffee in your mouth,
[29:51.790 --> 30:00.030]  you need a banana immediately after. I came home after that shooting day not very hungry for
[30:00.030 --> 30:03.530]  dinner. And I was like, that's so weird. I didn't even eat lunch. And I remember I probably ate like
[30:03.530 --> 30:09.410]  four bananas. Dude, I was so fucking, I mean, I was nauseous for a couple reasons after that,
[30:09.470 --> 30:15.670]  but I think a lot of it was just what we put in us. And I didn't even, I didn't even like,
[30:15.750 --> 30:20.090]  I don't know, man. I was so into it. I didn't even care. I could have put, I would have put mayonnaise
[30:20.090 --> 30:23.210]  in my mouth that time. I would have put avocado. It wouldn't have mattered. I would have eaten
[30:23.210 --> 30:34.230]  sour cream. I was just, I was so in the zone filming with you. This show is sponsored by
[30:34.230 --> 30:40.830]  BetterHelp. When I'm feeling good, I find it so much easier to accomplish everything that I have
[30:40.830 --> 30:47.630]  to do, whether it's in my work or personal life. And it's so easy to bounce off of that. Like
[30:47.630 --> 30:54.150]  when I'm struggling, it could just make even the most simple of tasks a challenge. And it's
[30:54.150 --> 31:01.710]  really easy to bounce off for me and not having a system in place to get back to where I need to be
[31:01.710 --> 31:06.730]  in the past made things so much more difficult. When you're at your best, you can do great things,
[31:06.870 --> 31:11.710]  but sometimes life gets you bogged down and you may feel overwhelmed or like you're not showing
[31:11.710 --> 31:15.890]  up in the way that you want to. Working with a therapist can help you get closer to the best
[31:15.890 --> 31:21.130]  version of you because when you feel empowered, you're more prepared to take on everything life
[31:21.130 --> 31:26.530]  throws at you. Therapy is an amazing thing. It has helped me in so many ways.
[31:26.530 --> 31:36.230]  Um, just dealing with grief as well as anxiety issues and just trauma in my background. Um,
[31:36.310 --> 31:40.890]  it allowed me to have systems and perspectives that I wouldn't have had without it. So I'd
[31:40.890 --> 31:45.470]  always strongly recommend giving it a try. If you're thinking of giving therapy a try,
[31:45.650 --> 31:50.510]  BetterHelp is a great option. It's convenient, flexible, affordable, and entirely online.

[35:05.670 --> 35:11.330]  So we had to buy the new modified version of it, which is basically you put it into a drill bit
[35:11.330 --> 35:15.830]  into a drill, and then it's got the rubber thing on the top, so you just have a soda on a drill.
[35:16.650 --> 35:24.010]  So we filmed that episode. We had this thing called the Garlic Master. We had these shoes
[35:24.010 --> 35:28.250]  that you slide on carpet with that we filmed. It turned out to be phenomenal. That was the episode
[35:28.250 --> 35:33.590]  I had the least planned for that turned out to be the best, I think. It was just like this wackier,
[35:33.590 --> 35:40.390]  wackier shit. The last one we had was a product called the Tack Shaver, and it's a tactical
[35:40.390 --> 35:44.390]  shaver. So you're supposed to be able to shave on the go, and like the dude in the trailer,
[35:44.530 --> 35:48.990]  it's a Bell & Howell product, so it's all like fake military shit. Like they have like a tactical
[35:48.990 --> 35:53.750]  flashlight, and like, you know, like tactical shoelaces, and like just stuff that doesn't need
[35:53.750 --> 36:01.070]  to be tactical, but they do it anyway, right? Like tack fork. So this tack shaver is fucking stupid,
[36:01.070 --> 36:07.310]  but it's like a little mini, uh, like face shaver, and it supposedly works underwater,
[36:07.630 --> 36:10.970]  for the, like Nick said, for the tactical man on the go. Like if you find yourself at the bottom
[36:10.970 --> 36:15.370]  of a swimming pool, and uh, with five o'clock shadow, you can shave under, in the bottom of
[36:15.370 --> 36:23.870]  the pool if you want to. So one of the ideas that we had was to submerge ourselves, and then try
[36:23.870 --> 36:30.030]  to shave underwater. We didn't have a swimming pool in the budget, so I asked for like a, uh,
[36:30.030 --> 36:35.750]  like a 10 or 20 gallon aquarium that I thought might work, and they weren't able to acquire that,
[36:35.870 --> 36:41.810]  but they did get this giant fish bowl that was like fucking big, and I picked it up, and I put
[36:41.810 --> 36:45.630]  my head on it very easily, and I was like, oh this works. Oh yeah, like a punch bowl, fish bowl,
[36:45.690 --> 36:49.070]  whatever. Uh, and I was like, yeah, this is perfect. And so we're filming, we're doing all
[36:49.070 --> 36:54.250]  this stuff, uh, we're racing the clock, because Gavin has a hard out at five, and we're, uh, you
[36:54.250 --> 36:59.030]  know, we started at two, we were like, we're just fucking cranking through these episodes. We have
[36:59.690 --> 37:03.450]  20 minutes to film this entire episode, and they're like, we probably should shut down,
[37:03.530 --> 37:06.130]  and we're like, no, we can get Gavin, and I'm like, no, we can get through this, because we're
[37:06.130 --> 37:10.550]  not going to get it. And it's because the actual shooting of the episode bit was really short,
[37:10.590 --> 37:13.930]  it was all the cleanup in between the episodes that was taking the time, but we could like
[37:13.930 --> 37:17.530]  rattle through an episode in like 10-15 minutes. Yeah, they're designed to be quick, and we're
[37:17.530 --> 37:21.870]  like, just don't clean up, we just won't clean up, and then we, I want the set to look progressively
[37:21.870 --> 37:27.290]  shittier as the season goes on anyway, uh, and boy will it, because we did some terrible stuff
[37:27.290 --> 37:33.270]  to that place. Um, and so, we fill this punch bowl up, I look up, we got like 9 minutes to go,
[37:33.610 --> 37:36.750]  Gavin tries to put his head in the water, he's going to shave, he tries to put his head in,
[37:36.970 --> 37:40.310]  just like dunk his head in, and then we have the razor in the bottom and just like grab it and
[37:40.310 --> 37:46.710]  try to shave underwater, uh, and, I mean, I'm, I don't mean this to be funny, uh, but Gavin,
[37:46.870 --> 37:52.930]  Gavin, Gavin's head wouldn't fit in the bowl because his nose was too big. It was like, my,
[37:52.930 --> 37:58.330]  my nose bone was, was the point of failure, I just couldn't, I was trying to angle my head,
[37:58.390 --> 38:06.950]  but it just kept smacking into my, into my damn big nose. And so, I was like, fuck it, I'll do it.
[38:08.690 --> 38:16.410]  I went from having the best time of my life to the emergency room in 30 seconds. Oh my god.
[38:16.990 --> 38:22.630]  I stick my head in, the, I put like a shower cap on, I stick my head in, I put my hand in to get
[38:22.630 --> 38:31.450]  the razor, and suddenly I hear a crack, and 10 gallons of water fall onto the ground, along with
[38:31.450 --> 38:39.650]  about a gallon of my blood. I, I look up, the bowl just shattered, and it sliced, uh, uh, open two of
[38:39.650 --> 38:47.950]  my fingers, on my left hand, and pretty fucking deep, and so, um, I had to go to the emergency
[38:47.950 --> 38:56.090]  room, for the first time in almost 20 years, I had to, of rooster teeth filming, I got, I had to go
[38:56.090 --> 39:01.510]  to the emergency room, and that is what my hand looks like today. I got five stitches, uh, that
[39:01.510 --> 39:07.510]  was very deep, yeah, my pinky, it cut to, it cut to my bone, so you can, like, they had the, the
[39:07.510 --> 39:11.430]  pinky was a little tough, and it cut, like, about half the circumference of my, or the diameter of
[39:11.430 --> 39:17.150]  my pinky is cut, in like, like a half circle around my pinky, and then the really deep puncture one
[39:17.150 --> 39:22.810]  is, uh, on my, my ring finger there, and, uh, I guess it's because you were leant over it, so that
[39:22.810 --> 39:27.630]  when it gave way, you kind of fell onto where it was, so it's actually really lucky it didn't, you
[39:27.630 --> 39:33.370]  know, nick the old jugular, but, uh, your hands went down to protect your head, and then straight
[39:33.370 --> 39:39.350]  into the glass, I assume. I assume so, yeah, it just all happened so fast, and so, um, you know,
[39:39.550 --> 39:44.110]  I don't think anyone has ever bled more from the hands on different occasions than you at this
[39:44.110 --> 39:48.030]  point. Oh my god, I know, right? Like, I'm sitting there getting stitches, and the guy's like,
[39:48.110 --> 39:51.950]  you ever had stitches before? And I'm like, yeah, three fingers over on my thumb. It was a giant
[39:51.950 --> 40:00.190]  scar. Oh my god. So, yeah, so that's, so I have stitches. I had to realize something troubling
[40:00.190 --> 40:03.950]  when I was in the ER. I was like, are these, uh, are these dissolvable? And they're like, nah,
[40:04.110 --> 40:07.730]  they, you gotta come back in 10 days to get the stitches pulled out, and I'm like, god damn it.
[40:07.990 --> 40:13.310]  And then I realized, I am out of my dental phase, like, my dental season is over, I think.
[40:13.310 --> 40:19.730]  Now I'm in stitches season. I had stitches in my balls last summer for the vasectomy. I had
[40:19.730 --> 40:24.850]  stitches in my mouth, like, two months ago, and now I have stitches in my hand. I've only had
[40:24.850 --> 40:30.130]  stitches in my body three times in the last 20 years, probably, and all three times have been
[40:30.130 --> 40:35.310]  in the last six months. I don't wanna be in stitches season. I don't want this season to
[40:35.310 --> 40:41.730]  continue. I'm putting that out there to the universe. No more stitches. It fucking sucks,
[40:41.730 --> 40:48.590]  they fucking hurt, oh my god, they have to numb up the cut. Do you know how they do that?
[40:49.110 --> 40:56.810]  They take a giant needle full of lidocaine, and they jab it into the wound 20 fucking times.
[40:57.430 --> 41:01.250]  Like, I just sat there, the stitches didn't hurt at all, because I was already numbed up,
[41:01.390 --> 41:07.190]  because they jabbed the needle full of lidocaine into the wound over and over again. And the guy's
[41:07.190 --> 41:09.870]  like, I'm really sorry, I know this part, this is the really rough part, and I'm like, yeah,
[41:09.870 --> 41:16.130]  I felt, I'm pretty sure he pierced my fucking pinky bone. It hurt so bad. Oh my god. Oh man,
[41:16.170 --> 41:21.510]  that sucked. I just couldn't, I couldn't believe it. And then we were trying to, like, quickly
[41:22.750 --> 41:26.490]  just, like, do the outro to the video. Just be like, well, that didn't work, let's do it. And
[41:26.490 --> 41:30.090]  then Geoff was like, yeah, let's just do it real quick. And then I was like, yeah, okay, let's,
[41:30.150 --> 41:33.530]  and then suddenly it was just like, oh, maybe we shouldn't, because that was just blood.
[41:33.730 --> 41:38.590]  It just, the blood was just pouring. So fast onto the floor. Couldn't get it to stop. Oh my god.
[41:39.130 --> 41:44.390]  But luckily, you know, Rishi's very close to an emergency room and, uh, they were, uh, those
[41:44.390 --> 41:49.710]  people were great. And there was, I did run into a community member in the emergency room who asked
[41:49.710 --> 41:57.270]  me for a photo. I was sitting there with Tyler in a chair in the waiting room with just a pile of
[41:57.270 --> 42:03.570]  rags on my hand and blood everywhere. And I was like, um, yeah, if you don't mind a bloody hand.
[42:03.630 --> 42:06.690]  And he's like, no, I don't care. And I was like, okay. So we took a photo with some dude.
[42:06.690 --> 42:14.030]  We just like, what are you in for? He was like, he was, he wasn't even there for anything. He was
[42:14.030 --> 42:19.250]  delivering something. Was that the most substantial injury you've received on a production?
[42:19.890 --> 42:23.290]  Oh, easily. I think it might be the only real injury I've ever received on a production
[42:23.290 --> 42:28.990]  that I can remember. That's crazy. For, for as much as there's an injury and everything,
[42:29.090 --> 42:33.790]  I talked with Shane, who's like our production manager, our head of all of our like studio
[42:33.790 --> 42:40.530]  production. Uh, he had nothing but good things to say about this. He's like, I hope that we can
[42:40.530 --> 42:44.890]  keep doing these, even though Geoff almost lost a finger. I really love does it do? And I didn't
[42:44.890 --> 42:51.330]  care how messy it was. That was a crazy shoot. Uh, that seemed like an insane shoot to be capped off
[42:51.330 --> 43:02.230]  by those cuts. That's wild, dude. Here's what I'll say. It was so good and so much fun. And I'm
[43:02.230 --> 43:10.010]  so proud of the shit we made in the first five episodes that the stitches and the cut don't
[43:10.010 --> 43:16.390]  bother me at all. I'm not mad at all. It was a dumb price to pay that I don't particularly want
[43:16.390 --> 43:21.570]  to pay. But if that's the price to pay, I'm happy to pay it because those episodes are so fucking
[43:21.570 --> 43:26.630]  fun to make. I hope it translates. I hope the audience likes it. I hope it's so successful
[43:26.630 --> 43:31.610]  that we get to do more of it because I agree with what Gavin said in the moment, and I hope you still
[43:31.610 --> 43:38.990]  do, Gav. I want to do that always. That is the most fucking fun I've... Maybe it's something that
[43:38.990 --> 43:43.490]  we could just do like five a year or something. Yeah. I mean, we just need to get together. We
[43:43.490 --> 43:48.970]  can film a season in a day easily. And then you just do like two seasons a year or something.
[43:49.330 --> 43:53.550]  We've yet to do a shoot day where one of us didn't get hurt. I mean, I wasn't hurt as badly
[43:53.550 --> 43:57.910]  as you were, but still, that's two for two. That's true. That's a great point. It is true.
[43:57.910 --> 44:02.650]  We'll get progressively safer as it goes. I think the biggest limiter for does it do
[44:02.650 --> 44:07.210]  is just going to be finding the products. Because interestingly enough, Andrew,
[44:07.710 --> 44:11.130]  from when we had that big meeting where we came up with all the ideas for the products
[44:11.530 --> 44:16.210]  to when we filmed just yesterday, two of those products went out of stock and disappeared off
[44:16.210 --> 44:22.010]  the internet. Not on eBay, not on news sites, not a shock. So it's like we lost and had to
[44:22.010 --> 44:25.830]  find quick replacements for two of the things. So it's just like there's just not that much out
[44:25.830 --> 44:29.470]  there that really that's really great to work with. Yeah, maybe we should just buy throughout
[44:29.470 --> 44:34.750]  the year and then when we have enough, just film a sesh. I think so, too, because I think that the
[44:34.750 --> 44:39.290]  real limiter is just going to be finding the products to to investigate. Do you think the
[44:39.290 --> 44:43.390]  limiter is that? I think the limiter is one of you getting hurt from the sounds of it. Like,
[44:43.430 --> 44:48.170]  that's when that's when it ends. Almost. I could see a world where you film as many episodes until
[44:48.170 --> 44:52.950]  you have to be rushed to the ER or Gavin somehow breaks every bone in his body while not breaking
[44:52.950 --> 44:58.610]  anything simultaneously. There's a hundred percent injury rate on the filming of this show.
[44:59.410 --> 45:04.210]  For both. There is. That is a good point. That is a good point. I also like I've been doing
[45:04.210 --> 45:09.810]  production for nineteen and a half years, 20 years now. Dumb jackass style production.
[45:10.230 --> 45:14.370]  I made it almost 20 years without having to go to the ER. I think that's a really,
[45:14.870 --> 45:18.930]  really good. That's a really good run. Like, I can't complain about that. You know?
[45:19.270 --> 45:22.450]  No, that's great. I've done one that resulted in the emergency room.
[45:22.750 --> 45:26.130]  Like, I remember you cut your knee that time, right? On a slo-mo shoot, Gav?
[45:26.390 --> 45:31.070]  Yeah, I got hit with a bit of shrapnel and it was too gruesome to put in the episode,
[45:31.830 --> 45:35.650]  which is double sad. It is because you lose the footage too, right? The thing that would
[45:35.650 --> 45:38.370]  is good that bummed me. I was thinking about in the emergency room and I was waiting.
[45:38.770 --> 45:42.430]  The thing that bummed me out the most is I felt like in episode six, the one that we're going to
[45:42.430 --> 45:49.910]  lose, the tack shaver, I nailed the intro. That was the best intro. I nailed the fucking intro.
[45:50.330 --> 45:55.430]  While I was doing it, I was like, holy shit, this is a good intro I'm doing. I want to go back and
[45:55.430 --> 45:59.610]  redo the other intros, but I can't because I'm covered in bananas and shit. This is a great
[45:59.610 --> 46:05.650]  intro. And then just fucking, yeah. Well, maybe we can show it one day at like an event or something
[46:05.650 --> 46:10.290]  where it's not put online. Yeah, maybe. I mean, we'll definitely go back and redo the tack shaver
[46:10.290 --> 46:13.470]  because we have a couple of minutes too funny not to. We'll just, you know, work with acrylic
[46:13.470 --> 46:18.250]  next time and stay away from glass. There'll be a no glass set from here on out. That's for sure.
[46:19.130 --> 46:24.270]  That's exciting. I have no idea what that will look like, but I know it's going to be great.
[46:24.390 --> 46:28.530]  And I do like that we've established. I feel like those do need to be shot in one sequence.
[46:28.710 --> 46:34.130]  I think the progression of the set and just the mess that is caused by these things have to be
[46:34.130 --> 46:38.770]  consistent. Totally agree. Yeah. And it's fun to see them. I want to do another season just because
[46:38.770 --> 46:43.090]  I feel like we learn more each time and we get a little bit better each time. Yeah. Like everything
[46:43.090 --> 46:46.810]  that I know now after two filming sessions, I'll apply to the third and then I feel like it'll
[46:46.810 --> 46:51.570]  just be that much funnier. Oh, for sure. Yeah. I can't. Do we have any idea when those will roughly
[46:51.570 --> 46:55.590]  be out? I mean, I know you guys just shot them. It's probably going to be a bit. I have a meeting
[46:55.590 --> 47:04.030]  tomorrow about when we can actually get these through post, but I moved a lot of stuff around
[47:04.030 --> 47:10.570]  and I do think that it'll be sooner rather than later. Awesome. What I would like to do is see
[47:10.570 --> 47:17.410]  if anyone wants to top line sponsor this thing, because I feel like this show is too good. OSHA
[47:17.410 --> 47:24.630]  maybe? Yeah, we'll see if OSHA can throw some money at us. Hey, don't be like these guys,
[47:24.990 --> 47:28.610]  one who almost broke his ass and the other one who almost lost a finger.
[47:30.890 --> 47:39.710]  Work safety is important. I don't do. Once there is a catalog of episodes available that people
[47:39.710 --> 47:44.590]  could see, I think it would be so funny to go to the people that make these products and like
[47:44.590 --> 47:50.970]  reach out to them to try to get them the sponsor that doesn't do that episode. I think that would
[47:50.970 --> 47:55.830]  be the ones that are still in business. Yes, the ones that that survive long enough for you to get
[47:55.830 --> 47:58.590]  a response from like whatever. I don't know what you do. I don't know what you do. I don't know
[47:58.590 --> 48:04.390]  with what, but like whatever caused the explosion on the on you, Geoff, or the team, whatever that
[48:04.390 --> 48:10.250]  was like that company, the idea that that company sees the footage of does it do and is like, yep,
[48:10.310 --> 48:15.130]  that's what we want is very funny to me. Just it sounds like we're almost holding them hostage.
[48:15.250 --> 48:20.810]  A sponsor will really show you what this is capable of. Well, first off, I want to say we
[48:20.810 --> 48:27.590]  are impartial with and it's a it's an honest evaluation. There were multiple products without
[48:27.590 --> 48:32.850]  spoiling stuff. Multiple products made it into the into the wall of dew and multiple products
[48:32.850 --> 48:38.930]  made it into the pile of don't. Some stuff worked better than advertised. Some stuff did exactly what
[48:38.930 --> 48:42.990]  they said it did and it did it better than they said it would. Like some of those products I was
[48:42.990 --> 48:50.910]  legitimately blown away by. Some of the products were utter dog shit. Just a just a just a travesty.
[48:52.790 --> 48:56.670]  So we kind of run the gamut on both. Eric, I thought it was you, but it may have been Tyler
[48:56.670 --> 49:02.530]  that told me one of the people that we got product from when they sent the product said,
[49:02.710 --> 49:06.990]  by the way, we're big fans. Oh, were you? Oh, no, I hadn't heard that. That's awesome. Yeah.
[49:07.170 --> 49:10.410]  Talk to Tyler because he knows whoever that was. Whoever that was, we could talk to him. Oh,
[49:10.470 --> 49:14.550]  that's oh, hell yeah. That's so cool. Yeah, I thought so, too. I don't remember which one it
[49:14.550 --> 49:21.110]  was, but yeah. So we have what, seven? You've done seven products at this point? Yeah. Yeah. I think
[49:21.110 --> 49:27.370]  season one will just be seven instead of eight. OK, are there any of those? You said that you
[49:27.370 --> 49:31.930]  like them. Have you incorporated any of these into like your routine or will they be going
[49:31.930 --> 49:38.310]  forward? You said it's not yet a life hack fashion. No, not just like I think I think
[49:38.310 --> 49:42.510]  these are all life hacks, right? Isn't the general concept of all these products, in a sense,
[49:42.570 --> 49:46.190]  is they're trying to be a life hack in a way? I was just curious if any of these are like,
[49:46.270 --> 49:50.950]  I use this every day now. I went into this doing a goofy thing, but now this is this is my shit.
[49:51.110 --> 49:57.670]  I'm going to I'll say this. There's one product in particular that I definitely won't be
[49:57.670 --> 50:02.650]  incorporating into any facet of my life. And that's the I'll just say it. That's the fucking
[50:03.650 --> 50:06.710]  useless garlic master. What a hunk of shit that was.
[50:10.690 --> 50:17.490]  Oh, my God. I'm so excited. That's the one that we couldn't figure out how to open and then
[50:17.490 --> 50:19.490]  fell apart in our fucking hands.
[50:23.430 --> 50:28.830]  I actually wrote down a new life hack. Oh, you have one? Because I don't I don't really I clearly
[50:28.830 --> 50:32.550]  don't really get life hacks yet. I've not really come up with one that's a good life hack. Is this
[50:32.550 --> 50:38.590]  a life hack? Okay. Ikea furniture doesn't survive moves. How would that be a hack?
[50:39.730 --> 50:43.830]  Well, that means if you're if you're if you're going to if you're buying Ikea furniture for
[50:43.830 --> 50:49.910]  a place that you're going to move out of soon, don't. Okay. No, you're phrasing of it. It would
[50:49.910 --> 50:57.570]  be like if that's a fortune cookie that I'm mad I opened what you just said. I understand what
[50:57.570 --> 51:03.550]  you're saying, but that makes no sense. How is that a hack? I like Ikea. I like the cost of the
[51:03.550 --> 51:09.690]  stuff. But every time I've moved a Billy bookcase with movers, it it becomes a chipped up, smashed
[51:09.690 --> 51:14.290]  up piece of collapsing shit. Okay, this is your problem, though, Gavin. I own let's say I own
[51:14.290 --> 51:19.890]  Ikea furniture. I've now you've given me this information. I need to move. What am I supposed
[51:19.890 --> 51:27.110]  to do with that information for my expectation? Yeah, don't bother. I know. I think this could
[51:27.110 --> 51:33.450]  fall under under hack. No, this is once again, just information. This is not because it's like
[51:33.450 --> 51:38.910]  Gavin saying, if you're if you buy Ikea furniture and you plan to move, don't don't buy the furniture
[51:38.910 --> 51:44.350]  or don't plan to move with the furniture. Because here's the thing about Ikea furniture. It's,
[51:44.950 --> 51:49.010]  you know, it doesn't survive the moves. The movers smash it all up. But also they're incredibly
[51:49.010 --> 51:53.270]  difficult to dismantle and put back together. Like a lot of the time when you build Ikea,
[51:53.550 --> 51:57.510]  you're like wrecking it up in place and then it's pretty much stuck that way.
[51:57.890 --> 52:02.390]  I think you could maybe make this a hack if it was like, hey, if you're moving somewhere,
[52:02.950 --> 52:08.610]  ship it to where you're going to move to and then build it there. Don't like don't don't attempt to
[52:08.610 --> 52:12.830]  send it to you. Mine's more of like, even if you know you're going to move in a year, don't do it.
[52:12.930 --> 52:17.990]  But I don't think here's here's the hack. Here's the hack. Here's the hack. Here's the hack.
[52:18.250 --> 52:24.930]  If you buy Ikea furniture, which is fine, we all have Ikea furniture. I have a ton of it.
[52:25.270 --> 52:31.330]  If you buy Ikea furniture, build it where it's going to live forever, because the moment you
[52:31.330 --> 52:36.470]  have to move it, it's going to fall apart. But like, that's not a hack. No, it's not like the
[52:37.210 --> 52:43.010]  do this. No, no, because the hack is like do this instead of that. And all you're saying,
[52:43.310 --> 52:50.870]  all you're saying is if you have Ikea furniture, leave it. And that's not a hack. That's just you
[52:50.870 --> 52:56.770]  telling a friend how to move. And your initial criticism of my hack was that all I did was
[52:56.770 --> 53:02.190]  order a thing. OK, well, so here's what I'll say. But your but your version of the hack would be
[53:02.190 --> 53:08.850]  order the Schmeckle on Ikea. That's not a hack. No, this is my version of the hack. You want to
[53:08.850 --> 53:14.830]  bench in a table. If you buy this thing, you get those things at a cheaper price. That is essentially
[53:14.830 --> 53:22.650]  what my hack was. I think a hack to me is you're getting either value or something that they don't
[53:22.650 --> 53:28.410]  intend for how their system is set up by placing the order or whatever you're doing. It doesn't
[53:28.970 --> 53:37.250]  say dictionary dot com says the definition of life. I fucking lost it. Where'd it go?
[53:39.290 --> 53:46.870]  He just set up a real gotcha and then fell on his ass. I think you'll find a dictionary dot com
[53:46.870 --> 53:55.550]  defines a life hack as a tip, trick or efficient method for doing or managing a day to day task
[53:55.550 --> 54:00.610]  or activity. Yeah, I don't think that what you said, Gavin, categorizes as any of those.
[54:01.690 --> 54:05.130]  It's just advice. Do you think I could have phrased it in a way that would make it a hack?
[54:05.230 --> 54:09.690]  Here's the thing. With all of your hacks, they're all information I'm glad I have.
[54:10.130 --> 54:15.110]  Like, I'm not upset about what you're telling me. I just it doesn't change the situation at all.
[54:15.270 --> 54:20.050]  And it doesn't make the process easier. What is? I think I'm working towards releasing my
[54:20.050 --> 54:23.690]  own life hack book based on these findings. But I think the reviews are going to be pretty
[54:23.690 --> 54:27.790]  shitty at this rate. I think it would be a great advice book. Just not a hack book.
[54:27.910 --> 54:32.030]  What if instead of calling these life hacks, what if we call them like Gavin's life tips?
[54:32.570 --> 54:34.630]  Because I'm the last person who should be giving advice.
[54:35.410 --> 54:38.890]  Something I just I want. How many? But isn't a life hack advice?
[54:39.550 --> 54:44.830]  God damn it. No, a life hack is not advice. Advice is not a life hack. A tip is advice.
[54:44.830 --> 54:52.990]  Yeah, but that's not a life. It's different. Dictionary.com describes.
[54:53.390 --> 55:00.190]  If you OK, this is if we're out somewhere and you're like, I don't like spicy things
[55:00.190 --> 55:03.170]  and you're going to buy something spicy because I know I've experienced that.
[55:03.250 --> 55:05.430]  And I said, oh, don't buy that. That's not a life hack.
[55:05.850 --> 55:12.670]  This is me advising based on experience. It needs to somehow circumvent
[55:13.150 --> 55:18.370]  some other obstacle in a more efficient way. All right. So I don't think we're in
[55:18.370 --> 55:21.710]  hack territory. I want you to keep at it because I'm enjoying these tips.
[55:22.490 --> 55:25.890]  They're great tips. As somebody who's looking at buying something for my kids,
[55:25.950 --> 55:29.410]  you are in your hacking phase or you're trying to get to it.
[55:29.650 --> 55:31.770]  You're on the road to a hacking phase.
[55:33.930 --> 55:36.550]  Well, I can see hack mountain, but I keep just climbing about the hills.
[55:37.110 --> 55:41.790]  Yeah. Why? While I thought your wording was dog shit, Gavin, I did think there was a life
[55:41.790 --> 55:45.630]  hack in there. So I guess I'm at the bottom of life hack mountain with you.
[55:46.430 --> 55:48.730]  I'll let you know when my book's out. What did you think the life hack was?
[55:49.130 --> 55:53.230]  OK, maybe it is a wording thing, Geoff. If you're going to reword his point to make it a life hack.
[55:53.230 --> 55:56.290]  I already tried to and you said it didn't work. Fair enough.
[55:56.570 --> 55:58.710]  Yeah. So I did my best.
[56:00.790 --> 56:03.170]  Mainly scheduling Warzone games that you don't show up to.
[56:03.550 --> 56:09.830]  That happened once. That's an exaggeration. I did the night I texted you.
[56:09.830 --> 56:13.030]  This is I don't know if this is an endorsement for how big the Gerpler is.
[56:13.350 --> 56:18.150]  I texted you to confirm that I just had a feeling that you weren't going to get back to me.
[56:18.250 --> 56:20.470]  So I was like, I'm going to have a bath. So I had a bath.
[56:20.990 --> 56:24.070]  All comfortable. It's great. Got the water on. It's warm. I'm cozy.
[56:24.430 --> 56:27.370]  I was like, you know what? I'm just going to I'm going to put my phone down.
[56:27.430 --> 56:30.490]  I'm not even going to worry about you replying for a little bit.
[56:30.570 --> 56:35.330]  I'm just going to close my eyes and relax. And so I go to move my phone on my hands
[56:35.330 --> 56:38.010]  and then place it on the toilet seat to my left.
[56:38.330 --> 56:42.430]  And I had forgotten that I had put a Gerpler full of water there.
[56:42.650 --> 56:48.750]  And the Gerpler is such a big open top. I dropped my phone into my Gerpler in the dark.
[56:49.890 --> 56:54.050]  And then and then halfway like was half falling.
[56:54.050 --> 56:59.090]  And I panicked. I was like, oh, water. And I threw my phone onto the ground.
[56:59.130 --> 57:02.870]  And I was like, I guess I hope he doesn't reply now because I have no idea if he
[57:02.870 --> 57:06.530]  talking about your new phone, though, your new refurbished pixel phone.
[57:06.710 --> 57:11.310]  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. My new refurbished drops all the time. I hate whatever material it's made of.
[57:11.370 --> 57:14.910]  It slides off of everything. I know it hits the floor constantly.
[57:14.970 --> 57:20.410]  It is hitting the floor over 80 times easily. It's constantly falling.
[57:20.690 --> 57:24.950]  But I almost put it fully in the it would have went all the way in the Gerpler.
[57:25.170 --> 57:29.190]  The top is so big. But then I felt the water panic, threw it to the floor.
[57:29.590 --> 57:32.490]  Then I fell asleep for like 20 minutes.
[57:32.490 --> 57:35.650]  I got so comfortable. I didn't know how much time had passed.
[57:35.850 --> 57:39.930]  I was worried that you had replied and that I had missed it.
[57:40.350 --> 57:43.250]  And so I had to like I was grabbing towels off the floor.
[57:43.390 --> 57:45.830]  I didn't want to get out of the bath, but I needed the phone.
[57:45.970 --> 57:49.430]  So I went on this whole fishing expedition to get the phone back.
[57:49.610 --> 57:52.970]  And I finally got it. And then Geoff had texted me like five minutes prior.
[57:54.030 --> 57:57.330]  I didn't hear from you until like an hour or two hours after that, maybe.
[57:57.530 --> 57:58.610]  Yeah, it was a whole thing.
[57:59.270 --> 58:03.450]  Speaking of bathrooms and actually playing Call of Duty together,
[58:04.090 --> 58:06.550]  should we talk about the bathroom adventure?
[58:06.910 --> 58:08.370]  We should. That was great.
[58:09.210 --> 58:12.490]  So we I don't I don't know when that became the strategy,
[58:12.590 --> 58:14.170]  but the three of us were playing Warzone.
[58:14.350 --> 58:19.610]  I don't think you played a lot of the last Warzone, Geoff, but you had played a ton of Warzone
[58:19.610 --> 58:23.890]  one on Verdansk, and I played a lot of like previous like Blackout as well.
[58:23.950 --> 58:25.290]  But yeah, yeah.
[58:25.310 --> 58:27.090]  And then Gavin and I have just are playing.
[58:27.090 --> 58:29.570]  I don't think Gavin has played Warzone for a long time.
[58:29.690 --> 58:32.530]  I don't know. I haven't played since Blackout.
[58:33.210 --> 58:36.150]  Yeah. So we started that and we're just we're having fun.
[58:36.210 --> 58:37.390]  We're doing goofy things.
[58:37.490 --> 58:41.850]  And then we decided, let's try to actually win, which largely is based around hiding.
[58:42.190 --> 58:47.270]  And so we adopted this bathroom strategy where the three of us would all like huddle up in it.
[58:47.350 --> 58:48.470]  We get some supplies.
[58:48.710 --> 58:49.910]  Oh, my picture is too powerful.
[58:50.730 --> 58:51.690]  That picture.
[58:52.650 --> 58:54.290]  We just wait in the bathroom.
[58:54.290 --> 58:58.850]  And one of my favorite features, which I'm sure is terrible, too, for Warzone 2,
[58:59.270 --> 59:03.730]  is whenever anyone's in your proximity and they're in game chat, you can see.
[59:03.830 --> 59:04.830]  So I'm just going to post a photo.
[59:04.950 --> 59:06.170]  This is our bathroom set up.
[59:06.510 --> 59:07.650]  I'm crouched in the middle.
[59:07.810 --> 59:10.430]  You can see Geoff and Gavin over each of my shoulders.
[59:10.830 --> 59:13.110]  We've got this door locked down.
[59:13.170 --> 59:14.610]  If anyone tries to open it, they're in trouble.
[59:15.470 --> 59:16.170]  We're holding out.
[59:16.290 --> 59:18.210]  We were there for probably like five or ten minutes.
[59:18.310 --> 59:21.010]  We lasted a long time in this bathroom.
[59:21.010 --> 59:25.290]  And then we got the ping on the screen of somebody is in our proximity.
[59:25.510 --> 59:26.470]  There's somebody talking.
[59:26.870 --> 59:29.670]  And whatever that happens, I love to go into game chat and just listen.
[59:30.090 --> 59:33.470]  Because it's almost always it's always great from my experience.
[59:33.590 --> 59:37.650]  Either it's somebody who is not like they're taking it very seriously or they're not at all.
[59:37.750 --> 59:38.590]  It's a baby crying.
[59:39.030 --> 59:40.570]  It's just something's always going on.
[59:41.070 --> 59:46.850]  So I went into game chat and it was this woman talking with her team and they were so tactical.
[59:46.850 --> 59:50.770]  They were like fully role playing, like the soldier thing of like,
[59:50.810 --> 59:53.810]  I'm scanning room one, going and progressing on your right, on your right,
[59:53.890 --> 59:56.190]  passing your flank, clearing, all clear.
[59:56.410 --> 59:58.150]  Like they were clearing room by room.
[59:58.510 --> 01:00:00.070]  They probably had tack shavers in their pocket.
[01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.150]  They probably did.
[01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:03.270]  They're probably well versed in tack shaving.
[01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:05.830]  So they're going room by room.
[01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:11.450]  And then she opens the door and she was so startled by the three of us with our guns,
[01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:12.330]  just ready to go.
[01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:13.650]  She broke character.
[01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:16.110]  She just went, oh, they're in the bathroom.
[01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:20.310]  All of the, everything, the tone completely shifted.
[01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:22.210]  Then it was complete mayhem.
[01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:23.930]  I ran out after her.
[01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:28.990]  I broke her shields, but then I got downed and then I died.
[01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:30.670]  And I thought, oh, we're over.
[01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:31.490]  It's done.
[01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:34.570]  And then Gavin, what did you, well, how did you guys survive that?
[01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:34.990]  What happened?
[01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:38.830]  I ran out, uh, just started blasting.
[01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:42.310]  I think I emptied half of my shotgun into Geoff by accident,
[01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:44.510]  which was a friendly fire, so I didn't kill him or anything.
[01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:46.370]  But I just wasn't shooting the right people.
[01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:50.270]  And then I noticed that someone was downed.
[01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:53.870]  So I had a sniper out because I'd wasted most of my shotgun.
[01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:55.250]  So I switched to my sniper.
[01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:57.670]  I started trying to shoot the person crawling along the floor.
[01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:03.630]  I missed like four shots and then I got downed and then I crawled back to Geoff.
[01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:07.590]  Geoff got me up right as the third person ran into the room
[01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:10.610]  and I somehow got up and within a split second,
[01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:14.630]  no scope that person who just ran in, saving both of us.
[01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:15.790]  It was incredible.
[01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.530]  It was wild.
[01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:20.670]  I shot a, I killed one of the three of them with a rocket launcher at close range
[01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:24.230]  because I panicked and I wish we had Gavin's photo.
[01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:28.070]  The room on the other side of that door is just painted.
[01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:30.430]  It looks like a, it looks like they filmed three seasons of Does It Do?
[01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.730]  It's just painted in blood and guts.
[01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.770]  It was wild.
[01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:37.070]  It just, everything was destroyed.
[01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.130]  It was so much fun.
[01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:41.550]  We had a similar encounter later where once again went into game chat.
[01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:44.650]  We seem to encounter the most serious teams that evening
[01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:46.610]  and we kept winning somehow against them.
[01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:47.770]  It would make me so happy.
[01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:49.430]  It was great.
[01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:53.850]  Like we couldn't have been, we're the least competent crew in the session by far.
[01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:57.630]  So, so getting these victories over these people that are taking the game super seriously.
[01:01:58.090 --> 01:01:59.170]  Oh, it's wonderful.
[01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:01.250]  I think, I think we have...
[01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:03.310]  That's after the fight.
[01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:04.950]  Such a great before and after.
[01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:11.010]  That's me.
[01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:13.190]  That's my dead body right in front of the door.
[01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:16.090]  All three of us are in that photo.
[01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:21.090]  I'll see if I can put, I'll get my full clip up where I think it starts to be just missing
[01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:22.450]  with the sniper four times.
[01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:22.970]  It's great.
[01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:29.910]  I think our, like we have a unique form of panic that's very unpredictable for people
[01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:30.930]  who know how to play the game.
[01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:35.730]  So I think we have, in some ways we have the advantage because they can't figure out what
[01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:37.750]  we're going to do because we don't know what we're going to do.
[01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:38.730]  It's genius.
[01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:39.730]  Yeah, it's brilliant.
[01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:40.810]  It's genius strategy.
[01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:42.030]  It's been really fun.
[01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:47.110]  Andrew, did you see the clip I posted on Slack of you leaping your quad bike into the train?
[01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:48.670]  No, I haven't watched it.
[01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:49.550]  Oh, it's a good one.
[01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:52.390]  It definitely won't fit in Discord, but yeah, it's a goodie.
[01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:56.970]  I tried to drive a vehicle onto because there's a train that goes around the map and I was
[01:02:56.970 --> 01:03:00.530]  curious if we could like park vehicles on it to escape if we needed to.
[01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:01.910]  They just explode.
[01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:07.010]  No matter what you do, like as soon as you land, they just explode and you get knocked
[01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.270]  down.
[01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:08.930]  So do not do that.
[01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:10.010]  I'd avoid doing that.
[01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:16.670]  It was kind of a shame how much fun we had just playing video games because it really
[01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:19.610]  made me want to make a face video game show.
[01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:20.450]  We should.
[01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:21.470]  I don't know.
[01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:22.510]  I don't know why we wouldn't.
[01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:24.950]  I have been trying to get you guys to do that.
[01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:28.010]  I figured it'd be a great Gavin and Andrew show since you guys play together so much,
[01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:29.390]  but I had so much fucking fun.
[01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:30.530]  I goddamn do that.
[01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:32.330]  I have fun that night playing Call of Duty with y'all.
[01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:34.970]  Uh, I think it's a great idea.
[01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:36.050]  Tomorrow.
[01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:38.890]  Yeah, there's a date comes out tomorrow.
[01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:41.350]  The issue is the editing side of it.
[01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:42.750]  Yeah, we can easily film it.
[01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:44.890]  It's just who's going to cut that?
[01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:46.470]  Yeah, we've got no money.
[01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:46.970]  I'll have to.
[01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:49.830]  I mean, I'll have to try to talk to a guy to get a guy.
[01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:52.230]  But if it's something we want to do, it's something we can make happen.
[01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:53.610]  That is.
[01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:57.690]  No, we found out we don't need nitro.
[01:03:57.690 --> 01:04:03.790]  We don't need boosts for the server in order to get the server bigger.
[01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:07.690]  I'm not really clear on what the server, what the server boost does or really how to get it.
[01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:10.590]  As previously stated, I'm on Gavin's side.
[01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:15.870]  But in defense, once again to him, nitro, even though we don't need it, I want it.
[01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:17.150]  I've been thinking about that.
[01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:20.130]  Nitro is like the best sounding addition I've ever heard.
[01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.510]  But it doesn't.
[01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:23.270]  If I went to any restaurant, I know, I know we don't need it.
[01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:27.010]  But if anybody was like, hey, do you want to pay an extra dollar for nitro?
[01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:28.170]  I would always say yes.
[01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:30.170]  Yeah, imagine you're at a restaurant and they're like,
[01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:32.410]  would you like the shrimp or the shrimp nitro?
[01:04:32.590 --> 01:04:34.130]  You'd be like, oh, it's always nitro.
[01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:35.390]  100% nitro.
[01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.990]  You guys are insane.
[01:04:36.010 --> 01:04:36.890]  It's such a great...
[01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:37.070]  You're nuts.
[01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:37.990]  You're fucking nuts.
[01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:39.830]  It's a great word.
[01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.470]  Insane.
[01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:43.270]  There's no situation in which I don't want nitro.
[01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:44.590]  What is that?
[01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:47.390]  Have you ever had nitro cold brew?
[01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:48.250]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:50.410]  What is the nitro like nitrogen?
[01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:51.190]  Is that what they do?
[01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:51.410]  Yeah.
[01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.810]  Yeah.
[01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:52.290]  Yeah.
[01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:54.490]  They just make, it's like, you know, like when you have like a Guinness
[01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.690]  and then it's like kind of like heady and you have to like let it settle.
[01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:58.150]  It's that, but for coffee.
[01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:01.130]  So, oh, it makes it so creamy.
[01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:02.090]  Starbucks has one.
[01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:07.930]  I think a moral level though, I'm just against the idea of paying for boosts on anything.
[01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:09.370]  Like I just hate the sound of it.
[01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:09.950]  I agree with you.
[01:05:09.970 --> 01:05:10.510]  What am I boosting?
[01:05:10.610 --> 01:05:11.170]  Give me a service.
[01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:11.550]  Okay.
[01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:12.210]  Give me a plan.
[01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:13.630]  No, shut up.
[01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:13.970]  Okay.
[01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:20.230]  When we played, this is aggressive, but the first season of Halo Infinite,
[01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:23.830]  every time we'd play, you would start the session by going,
[01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:26.290]  I'm going to buy a level up, buying a boost.
[01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:27.670]  Buying a boost.
[01:05:27.830 --> 01:05:31.070]  It was the version of the game I got gave me 25 to use.
[01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:32.530]  And I would always just use a boost.
[01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:33.550]  I apologize.
[01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:35.150]  I wasn't out there.
[01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:36.090]  I assumed you bought them.
[01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:38.270]  Wow, that was an immediate apology.
[01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.770]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:39.790]  It was. I was wrong.
[01:05:39.830 --> 01:05:40.410]  That's pretty insane.
[01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:42.790]  When I'm wrong, I'll admit I'm wrong.
[01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:43.790]  I was right about the drafts.
[01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:44.490]  I was wrong about this.
[01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:46.870]  I have no issue admitting when I'm wrong.
[01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:49.950]  Speaking of the drafts, and Eric says we should wrap up.
[01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:50.950]  So we should probably start wrapping up.
[01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:53.010]  But now that we've, now that we're through with Does It Do?
[01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:55.350]  And I believe, not as of this recording,
[01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:57.970]  but this week, the Fireplace video will finally come up.
[01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:59.470]  Other than the Does It Do stuff,
[01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:02.210]  we're through all of our supplemental content.
[01:06:02.370 --> 01:06:03.030]  So we need to start.
[01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:05.570]  We've been on a fucking tear with supplemental content
[01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:06.610]  these last, like, three months.
[01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:07.870]  I want to keep that ball rolling.
[01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:11.650]  I think the Fireplace took three full days to process to 8K.
[01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:14.630]  Totally worth it, though.
[01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:16.290]  And you're right.
[01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:18.070]  It's just going to be comments from people going,
[01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:20.130]  and tweets from people I have to block,
[01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:21.570]  who are just going to be like,
[01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:23.590]  It's not in 8K for me.
[01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:25.470]  I could not care less.
[01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:26.090]  It's not.
[01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.830]  Look, we tried.
[01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:28.090]  There's nothing I can do.
[01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:29.750]  It is what it is at this point.
[01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:31.450]  Yeah, I'll say this.
[01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:32.290]  It's up there at 8K.
[01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:36.130]  If you have a browser slash device that can make use of it,
[01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:37.330]  then you'll see the option for it.
[01:06:37.330 --> 01:06:40.810]  If not, it will just be 4K or HD, I guess.
[01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:41.010]  Yep.
[01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:42.670]  But it's up there at 8K.
[01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:45.330]  So look forward to that, if you haven't already watched it.
[01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:47.510]  Also, Condor Man, we'll film at some point.
[01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:48.370]  Also, Does It Do?
[01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:50.050]  Also, a bunch of other stuff.
[01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:51.270]  Gavin had an idea.
[01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:52.250]  I know we're wrapping up.
[01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:55.450]  But Gavin had an idea that we're going to forget to talk about if we don't mention it here.
[01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:56.870]  When we were filming Does It Do?
[01:06:56.950 --> 01:07:00.330]  That I thought was one of the best ideas I've heard in a while.
[01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:02.290]  Gavin's idea...
[01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:03.690]  I don't think any of you guys heard it.
[01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:04.390]  I think it was just he and I.
[01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:07.110]  His idea was that we film an episode of F*** Face,
[01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:09.770]  where two people get caffeine pills,
[01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:11.250]  and two people take...
[01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:13.450]  Two people take Z-quals,
[01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:14.970]  and you don't know what you're taking,
[01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:16.650]  and then you just see what happens,
[01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:17.930]  and try to figure it out.
[01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:20.630]  It's so...
[01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:22.790]  Get Osha back as the sponsor for that one.
[01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:24.710]  Like, we can't do it.
[01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:25.770]  Like, we can't.
[01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:27.730]  But man, f***ing crazy.
[01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:30.950]  That's the sucky thing about this being technically work,
[01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:33.330]  is that it's work.
[01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:34.910]  But you can't do that at work.
[01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:36.110]  I know.
[01:07:36.110 --> 01:07:38.390]  But if we all took a day off and did it...
[01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:39.410]  No, I mean...
[01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:39.910]  Well, wait.
[01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:42.310]  So how potent is the caffeine pill?
[01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:43.470]  In comparison...
[01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:46.110]  Not as potent as all the caffeine I drink constantly, probably.
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:48.430]  I don't really drink caffeine.
[01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:50.790]  But it's concentrated, and it's gonna get you going.
[01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:51.890]  Like, you're gonna feel...
[01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:53.430]  You're gonna feel buzzy.
[01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:57.910]  And it would have to be something that's, like, on the level of a Z-quill or something.
[01:07:58.550 --> 01:07:58.930]  So...
[01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:00.450]  The reason I thought it'd be funny is that,
[01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:02.710]  after a few minutes, say after 10 minutes,
[01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:05.130]  you would feel some sort of change,
[01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:08.110]  but you wouldn't immediately be able to tell which one you had,
[01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:09.830]  if you didn't know what it was.
[01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:12.690]  Yeah, there's a hazy period where you just feel different.
[01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:14.350]  You don't know if it's a different energy or a different diet.
[01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:14.850]  Yeah, it's like, which way am I gonna go?
[01:08:16.450 --> 01:08:20.410]  We filmed a video, like a Let's Play Left 4 Dead thing,
[01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:22.470]  in, like, 2015, a long time ago.
[01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:24.870]  The three of us, and Caleb was part of that.
[01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:27.110]  And I was, like, so anxious about it.
[01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:28.130]  I was like, I need to pump up.
[01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:28.970]  I need some energy.
[01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:30.590]  I need to be enthused for this.
[01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:31.630]  I need to get going.
[01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:35.050]  So I drank, like, four Red Bulls in three minutes,
[01:08:35.170 --> 01:08:36.390]  right before we started shooting.
[01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:37.770]  I don't know if I told this story before.
[01:08:38.050 --> 01:08:41.570]  But I drank, like, four Red Bulls in a really condensed time.
[01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:43.150]  And then we filmed it.
[01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:44.570]  And we were done.
[01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:45.990]  I was like, that was great.
[01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:46.970]  And I, like, stood up.
[01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:49.250]  I was like, that was, oh, man, that was fun.
[01:08:49.650 --> 01:08:51.270]  And then I looked at everybody else.
[01:08:51.270 --> 01:08:52.630]  And you all were so relaxed.
[01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:53.950]  I was like, what's wrong with them?
[01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:57.930]  Oh, oh, I just drank, I drank, I don't drink energy.
[01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:00.410]  I just had four Red Bulls in an hour.
[01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:02.230]  You're an all or nothing kind of guy.
[01:09:02.530 --> 01:09:03.650]  I was a very all or nothing.
[01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:06.230]  Yeah, so that's, that's what I feel like I could tap into.
[01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:08.210]  I had, uh, I mean, we're supposed to wrap up.
[01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:10.970]  But, uh, I realized I could get cake drunk,
[01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:12.450]  which I'm very excited about.
[01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:13.810]  Somebody who doesn't drink.
[01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:14.990]  Oh, my God.
[01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:17.610]  How many bowls of cake do you take to get drunk?
[01:09:17.610 --> 01:09:19.230]  No, no, that's the thing.
[01:09:19.450 --> 01:09:22.250]  So I, I got this rum cake from a place.
[01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:25.430]  And I had one little notch of it.
[01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:27.390]  And I was tipsy because I don't drink at all.
[01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:28.210]  I was tipsy.
[01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:30.030]  I was like, if I went to a sporting event,
[01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.470]  I could get fucked up on cake easily.
[01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:35.390]  Any scenario, you give me just one cake,
[01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:36.790]  I could get so cake drunk.
[01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:39.710]  I love the idea of having a hangover from cake.
[01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:41.370]  I absolutely would.
[01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:43.670]  You go to a bar and everybody's like,
[01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:45.390]  everybody's drinking shots.
[01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:46.270]  And Andrew's like, hold on a second.
[01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:47.290]  Get some mouthful of cake.
[01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:50.530]  I think shots would be those little cupcakes.
[01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:51.490]  Those little mini ones.
[01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:01.650]  Slamming, slamming the paper wrapper on the bar.
[01:10:03.710 --> 01:10:04.550]  Oh, man.
[01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:05.570]  Well, there you go.
[01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:06.770]  Thanks for listening.
[01:10:07.210 --> 01:10:09.530]  Another episode of F*** Face in the Can.
[01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:12.170]  Keep your eyes peeled for Does It Do?
[01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:16.710]  Episodes three through seven will be out at some point in the near future.
[01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:18.630]  Don't forget to check out our new fireplace video.
[01:10:18.730 --> 01:10:19.590]  It is in 8K.
[01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:21.630]  And if you have any issues with that, just let Eric know.
[01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:23.550]  He said he's happy to help you troubleshoot.
[01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:26.910]  And we released a mystery package this week.
[01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:28.250]  And you guys bought it all up.
[01:10:28.330 --> 01:10:29.090]  And thank you for that.
[01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:30.910]  I hope you enjoy.
[01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:33.190]  We filled it with all kinds of stuff.
[01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.310]  It's like five or six different items in it.
[01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:39.110]  And really, really, really appreciate y'all supporting us by buying that.
[01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:45.310]  And if you're so inclined to put a star next to this podcast on a program,
[01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:48.830]  or even in like a notebook at your school where you write down stuff,
[01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:51.870]  like on the cover, and then you write down like F*** Face,
[01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:54.790]  and then put a little star next to like the weird S you draw on a Metallica logo.
[01:10:54.930 --> 01:10:56.410]  And then at lunch, maybe your friends will see it.
[01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:57.430]  And then they'll be like, what's F*** Face?
[01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:58.570]  I want to listen to that.
[01:10:58.890 --> 01:10:59.730]  It's got a star next to it.
[01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:00.310]  It must be pretty good.
[01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:02.050]  So stars mean good.
[01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:03.170]  We'll see you next time.
[01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:04.390]  Hey, guys.
[01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:07.890]  Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:09.790]  It's a party at Gavin's house.
[01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:12.110]  Geoff and Gavin have dead trees.
[01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:14.230]  How does one wipe with no power?
[01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:15.950]  Andrew got scammed.
[01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:17.810]  What is man-to-man coverage?
[01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:21.730]  It's spaghetti and meatballs, not spaghetti with meatballs.
[01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:22.930]  More licorice.
[01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:25.650]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:28.830]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
