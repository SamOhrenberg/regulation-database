[00:15.150 --> 00:16.910]  Why did Gavin join and he's muted?
[00:17.350 --> 00:17.890]  Who cares?
[00:18.390 --> 00:18.910]  Great.
[00:19.410 --> 00:20.590]  You said things are better.
[00:21.050 --> 00:25.370]  Hello! Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:25.830 --> 00:30.750]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always, Gavin Free and Andrew Pantin.
[00:31.290 --> 00:33.010]  Uh, hello boys.
[00:33.290 --> 00:33.630]  Hello.
[00:34.090 --> 00:35.290]  Gavin is shy. He's still muted.
[00:35.710 --> 00:36.350]  I don't know what's going on.
[00:36.350 --> 00:37.590]  Well this is perfect because...
[00:37.950 --> 00:39.970]  Uh, Gavin and I were supposed to have a friendtervention.
[00:39.970 --> 00:41.090]  A friendintervention.
[00:41.450 --> 00:42.770]  Uh, we teased it up the last one.
[00:42.910 --> 00:43.950]  So we'll just have it right now.
[00:44.150 --> 00:45.590]  Uh, I'll kick it off.
[00:45.690 --> 00:47.670]  Gavin, what the f*** your response?
[00:48.910 --> 00:49.430]  He left.
[00:49.470 --> 00:50.290]  Oh, he left the call.
[00:50.310 --> 00:50.770]  He left.
[00:50.930 --> 00:51.470]  Yeah, he's gone.
[00:51.810 --> 00:52.350]  There you go.
[00:52.490 --> 00:53.490]  Yeah, he's not here anymore.
[00:53.690 --> 00:55.230]  I clearly won that argument.
[00:55.510 --> 00:55.650]  Alright.
[00:56.690 --> 00:57.450]  Congratulations, man.
[00:58.290 --> 00:59.370]  He's back and muted again.
[01:00.070 --> 01:00.730]  He's back and muted.
[01:01.410 --> 01:03.090]  Is Gavin late at this point?
[01:03.170 --> 01:04.030]  I would say he's late.
[01:04.350 --> 01:06.470]  Yeah, I wonder what his argument is that he's not.
[01:06.610 --> 01:08.050]  Here, well let's get... hold on a second.
[01:08.050 --> 01:14.970]  Gavin, we feel like you're being deficient in your duties of podcast participant and host as well as a friend.
[01:15.130 --> 01:16.330]  Would you care to respond?
[01:18.590 --> 01:19.930]  I think that's pretty clear.
[01:20.270 --> 01:21.030]  That's pretty...
[01:21.030 --> 01:22.390]  I think at this point he's late.
[01:22.870 --> 01:23.070]  Yeah.
[01:23.330 --> 01:24.210]  No, he's definitely late.
[01:24.590 --> 01:24.810]  Yeah.
[01:25.110 --> 01:27.010]  He just... he doesn't care.
[01:27.390 --> 01:29.970]  Oh, he just posted a photo of his computer.
[01:30.830 --> 01:31.350]  Uh...
[01:32.090 --> 01:32.610]  What?!
[01:32.610 --> 01:35.970]  Your Discord installation is corrupt.
[01:37.110 --> 01:42.910]  Wow, well imagine if he would have had some pleasantries and noticed that before we started so he wouldn't watch into this.
[01:43.030 --> 01:47.930]  Hey, before Gavin gets here, do you want to have a little bit of a merch meeting?
[01:49.010 --> 01:49.090]  Yeah.
[01:49.090 --> 01:51.270]  I could actually... it'd be great to have your opinion on something.
[01:51.690 --> 01:55.170]  Yeah, I'll say I missed the most recent merch meeting.
[01:55.890 --> 01:59.170]  I apologize to everybody who I've blown off or missed in the last week.
[01:59.250 --> 02:00.450]  My life has been a fucking nightmare.
[02:00.510 --> 02:01.270]  Yeah, you're pretty...
[02:01.270 --> 02:01.610]  Oh God.
[02:01.930 --> 02:03.810]  Yeah, you're in a fuck situation. Don't worry about it.
[02:03.930 --> 02:05.410]  Here's what we said with Tony.
[02:05.410 --> 02:07.850]  We said, Tony, merch meeting, want a fridge magnet?
[02:08.590 --> 02:10.970]  A magnet of Geoff's fridge that you can put on the fridge.
[02:11.110 --> 02:13.150]  And he said, okay, do you want it to open?
[02:13.310 --> 02:14.230]  And we said, what?
[02:14.510 --> 02:15.130]  Excuse me?
[02:15.590 --> 02:16.750]  And Tony just sent us this.
[02:17.030 --> 02:18.570]  What the fuck?!
[02:18.570 --> 02:20.510]  We can have magnets that open?!
[02:20.510 --> 02:20.690]  Dude.
[02:20.690 --> 02:21.550]  Yeah, I guess that's the thing.
[02:21.890 --> 02:27.410]  We said, if that can happen, we should have one Cosmic Crisp Apple in it.
[02:27.510 --> 02:28.890]  Oh, that's beautiful!
[02:29.570 --> 02:31.290]  Dude, we have to make this.
[02:31.290 --> 02:33.010]  Oh, we have to make this.
[02:33.670 --> 02:33.910]  Yeah.
[02:33.910 --> 02:39.250]  Yeah, that was such a dumb idea, but man, leave it to Tony to make a bad idea good.
[02:39.530 --> 02:39.730]  Yep.
[02:40.030 --> 02:42.810]  That's phenomenal. That deserves to be made. Absolutely.
[02:42.850 --> 02:45.470]  I'm letting him know right now, this rules, let's do it.
[02:46.670 --> 02:52.190]  Let's find out how many we have to make, and then we'll just communicate that number to the audience immediately.
[02:52.590 --> 02:54.670]  Hey, what's up, Gavin?
[02:55.510 --> 02:56.990]  Guess who's using the browser?
[02:57.570 --> 02:59.330]  Oh, your browser boy!
[03:00.710 --> 03:01.890]  There's two of us now.
[03:01.890 --> 03:04.710]  Well, my actual Discord just said it's corrupt.
[03:06.490 --> 03:09.830]  Can we not use shitty ass dog shit?
[03:10.350 --> 03:11.410]  Hell, that's Discord.
[03:11.790 --> 03:14.390]  What do you mean? If you just show up five minutes early, this isn't a problem.
[03:14.410 --> 03:15.790]  Works great for me. I'm using it right now.
[03:15.850 --> 03:21.250]  What do you want to use instead? Do you care? Like, do you want me to find something else? I can find something else.
[03:21.410 --> 03:22.230]  No, don't listen to him.
[03:22.750 --> 03:26.990]  Cool thing about Discord is it's accessible via multiple platforms.
[03:27.250 --> 03:29.610]  You want to get it on the browser? You can get it on the browser.
[03:29.850 --> 03:31.210]  If you want to use the app, use the app.
[03:31.210 --> 03:34.810]  I'm sorry, was your suggestion just Skype?
[03:35.470 --> 03:36.210]  I don't know.
[03:37.630 --> 03:44.190]  Gavin, you can't trust Gavin with Skype. Ever since he did that commercial with his grandfather when he was a little boy, he's been shilling that company.
[03:44.790 --> 03:46.610]  Did they pay you in stock? Is that what happened?
[03:47.030 --> 03:48.670]  Skype really dropped the ball. I don't know how.
[03:48.870 --> 03:49.890]  I think you got Skype credit.
[03:50.430 --> 03:52.950]  Do you guys know what I'm talking about? Have you ever seen that old commercial?
[03:53.130 --> 03:54.350]  No, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[03:54.430 --> 03:57.090]  Gavin and his grandfather... how old were you, Gav?
[03:58.190 --> 03:59.070]  17, 16?
[03:59.070 --> 04:07.530]  This kid in his charmed life, when Gavin was 16 or 17, he somehow became a part of a national campaign for commercials for Skype.
[04:07.990 --> 04:13.330]  And there is a television commercial of Gavin and his grandfather having Skype conversations together.
[04:13.510 --> 04:15.130]  It was all over TV in England.
[04:15.310 --> 04:16.070]  That's incredible.
[04:16.510 --> 04:17.910]  I had a line in it.
[04:18.170 --> 04:19.030]  What was your line?
[04:20.370 --> 04:21.430]  I'll do it. Are you ready?
[04:21.830 --> 04:24.850]  Do you need me to be Grandpa? Do Grandpa have lines?
[04:25.170 --> 04:27.530]  Yeah, you be Grandpa. You say, Hi, Gavin.
[04:27.570 --> 04:27.770]  Okay.
[04:28.930 --> 04:29.810]  Hi, Gavin.
[04:30.070 --> 04:31.910]  You gotta do it in an Italian accent.
[04:34.350 --> 04:35.850]  That's racist, I think.
[04:35.970 --> 04:37.070]  I don't know if we can do that.
[04:38.010 --> 04:39.450]  I was trying to do Mario.
[04:39.930 --> 04:41.690]  I was trying to do Mario.
[04:42.230 --> 04:43.690]  Okay, and then I'll do my bit.
[04:44.930 --> 04:45.250]  Hi.
[04:47.010 --> 04:48.330]  That's it? That's your line?
[04:49.570 --> 04:51.270]  Why did I have six lines?
[04:51.610 --> 04:52.650]  Did Nick just find it?
[04:53.470 --> 04:54.510]  Yay, there it is.
[04:55.630 --> 04:58.510]  It's a minute and a half long. This is too long for Skype.
[04:58.650 --> 04:59.790]  Yeah, it's too long.
[05:00.830 --> 05:02.530]  Yeah, that's out there. That's been out there for ages.
[05:02.730 --> 05:04.450]  Anyway, you guys can watch it after the podcast.
[05:04.630 --> 05:05.850]  That's funny. I had no idea.
[05:06.130 --> 05:07.090]  Look at that little cutie.
[05:07.430 --> 05:10.190]  I got that because I was on the Skype forums.
[05:10.610 --> 05:12.670]  I think I was trying to fix my granddad's Skype or something.
[05:12.770 --> 05:15.810]  And then there was a thread that said, tell us how you use Skype.
[05:15.910 --> 05:19.030]  And I was like, I use it to talk to my granddad.
[05:19.090 --> 05:21.150]  And they were like, that's great. Can we make a commercial about that?
[05:21.230 --> 05:21.610]  I was like, okay.
[05:21.930 --> 05:22.250]  Perfect.
[05:22.750 --> 05:25.870]  What was the best conversation you had with your granddad over Skype?
[05:25.950 --> 05:27.590]  How long were they, on average, would you say?
[05:27.910 --> 05:30.350]  Pretty long. We'd chat maybe half an hour ago.
[05:30.870 --> 05:33.670]  Now we just use this other thing called FaceTime.
[05:34.050 --> 05:34.910]  I thought you were going to say Discord.
[05:35.370 --> 05:37.410]  I was going to ask if your grandpa has Discord Nitro.
[05:37.470 --> 05:38.230]  He has Nitro.
[05:38.250 --> 05:41.330]  Because we could use a boost. We need nine more, apparently.
[05:41.930 --> 05:45.970]  You guys may not know this, but Gavin is exceptionally close to his grandfather.
[05:46.150 --> 05:47.130]  They are like best buddies.
[05:47.370 --> 05:47.670]  I love him.
[05:47.670 --> 05:52.610]  He used to send me these videos way, way, way, way, way before our Achievement Hunter.
[05:52.910 --> 05:56.150]  Of him getting his granddad to play games like Assassin's Creed.
[05:56.310 --> 05:57.930]  And watching him run around.
[05:59.230 --> 06:00.010]  You remember that?
[06:00.170 --> 06:03.030]  You remember those little gameplay videos you would send me of you and your grandpa playing games?
[06:03.750 --> 06:06.970]  Yeah. I wanted him to make Achievement Hunter videos.
[06:08.070 --> 06:08.930]  That would have been great.
[06:09.270 --> 06:11.130]  So that's it, Geoff? That's your friend-ervention?
[06:11.550 --> 06:12.030]  I feel like...
[06:12.030 --> 06:13.970]  Oh, yeah. So, Gavin, I guess we're good now.
[06:14.210 --> 06:14.750]  I missed it?
[06:14.990 --> 06:16.630]  I thought we had a nice chat the other night.
[06:16.630 --> 06:22.050]  I gave you plenty of opportunity to respond, and you didn't respond to anything I said, so I consider the beef squashed.
[06:22.310 --> 06:28.110]  You were like, our friendship's weird and awkward, and then we had a conversation, and you somehow fixed it in one go.
[06:28.350 --> 06:30.890]  Yeah. Here's what it turns out.
[06:31.530 --> 06:32.630]  I was trying to...
[06:34.210 --> 06:35.770]  As soon as I joined...
[06:35.770 --> 06:36.810]  Man, I am tongue-tied.
[06:37.210 --> 06:38.770]  As soon as I joined...
[06:38.770 --> 06:43.070]  Look, man, I've had one night of sleep in my bed in the last, like, eight days.
[06:44.490 --> 06:45.730]  I'm running on empty right now.
[06:46.990 --> 06:51.190]  But as soon as I joined, Eric was like, you gotta lead with the friend-ervention.
[06:51.350 --> 06:53.150]  And I forgot we ended with that last time.
[06:53.390 --> 06:58.430]  What happened was, the second the podcast ended, Gavin came over and he goes, do we need to have an intervention?
[06:58.850 --> 07:01.990]  And I was like, I think things are weird between us. Don't you think things are weird between us?
[07:01.990 --> 07:02.990]  And he was like, not really.
[07:03.070 --> 07:05.530]  And I was like, oh, okay, I guess it's just me, then. Do you want to hang out?
[07:05.570 --> 07:06.330]  And he was like, always.
[07:06.830 --> 07:07.510]  And then it's been fine.
[07:08.150 --> 07:08.810]  Yeah, well, you were like...
[07:09.770 --> 07:11.730]  I feel like things are awkward with every person.
[07:11.870 --> 07:13.070]  I was like, oh, am I making it awkward?
[07:13.290 --> 07:14.650]  And you were like, I think I am.
[07:14.650 --> 07:15.270]  And I was like, okay.
[07:15.750 --> 07:16.810]  And then it was fine.
[07:17.170 --> 07:17.710]  And that was it.
[07:18.110 --> 07:21.350]  And we had to have that one not-even-really-awkward conversation.
[07:21.630 --> 07:24.310]  And then we talked for two hours in Gavin's living room, and we've been great since.
[07:24.510 --> 07:26.170]  I'm glad that that's how it played out.
[07:26.410 --> 07:27.910]  Yeah, I felt awkward after you said it was.
[07:27.970 --> 07:29.170]  And I was like, oh, I guess maybe it is.
[07:29.230 --> 07:29.970]  And then I was like, is it me?
[07:30.030 --> 07:31.610]  And you were like, oh, I think it's me.
[07:31.730 --> 07:34.470]  And then after like two minutes, it felt fine.
[07:34.810 --> 07:35.870]  Oh, shit, I'm tongue-tied, too.
[07:35.950 --> 07:36.210]  Jesus.
[07:36.330 --> 07:38.530]  I'm so glad that the two of you are back.
[07:38.530 --> 07:47.010]  But I do wish it happened on the show, because it would have been so much more awkward, whatever the online exchange was between the two of you of trying to figure this out.
[07:47.170 --> 07:51.510]  Nah, we just had a really nice conversation, and then we went out to dinner where we screamed at each other.
[07:51.630 --> 07:52.090]  It was great.
[07:52.170 --> 07:53.950]  Oh, I forgot we went out to dinner.
[07:54.730 --> 07:55.370]  That's fantastic.
[07:55.850 --> 07:56.650]  What did you guys have?
[07:57.230 --> 07:58.990]  Uh, what did you have, Gav?
[07:59.090 --> 07:59.610]  You had pizza.
[07:59.890 --> 08:00.710]  I had a big pizza, yeah.
[08:00.850 --> 08:02.130]  I had a pizza that was, uh...
[08:02.130 --> 08:02.810]  I had a salad.
[08:03.090 --> 08:07.050]  It was one of those restaurants where it served about half a foot above the table.
[08:07.590 --> 08:08.070]  Oh, wow.
[08:08.070 --> 08:08.510]  It was special.
[08:08.770 --> 08:09.450]  That's fancy.
[08:10.570 --> 08:13.430]  Don't know why it couldn't have been on the table in front of me like a plate, but...
[08:13.430 --> 08:16.310]  Did you bring your own Branston for them to put on it at the restaurant?
[08:18.370 --> 08:25.330]  It was so loud in this restaurant that, like, Emily and Meg were across from Gavin and I about...
[08:25.330 --> 08:30.910]  I would say, I don't know about you, Gav, but I would say, like, maybe 30% of the way through dinner, I gave up trying to talk to them at all.
[08:31.310 --> 08:36.470]  It was just, I couldn't hear anything they said, and I couldn't yell loud enough, and I just talked to you for the...
[08:36.470 --> 08:37.610]  Maybe that's why I had such a good time.
[08:39.170 --> 08:43.470]  It's true. I kept having this message come up on my watch. I'll post it. Talk amongst yourselves.
[08:44.470 --> 08:46.570]  What do you think the message is gonna say, Andrew? Any guesses?
[08:46.950 --> 08:51.390]  I don't know. Do you think it'll be related to Discord? Do you think it will be...
[08:51.390 --> 08:52.350]  Too loud.
[08:52.590 --> 08:54.110]  Eric thinks it'll be too loud.
[08:54.190 --> 08:54.890]  Too loud.
[08:55.350 --> 08:57.370]  This isn't from In The Moment, but I took a screenshot of it.
[08:57.370 --> 09:00.190]  This is a fucking paragraph, this isn't a...
[09:00.190 --> 09:08.370]  Around 1 hour and 45 minutes a day at this level can cause temporary hearing loss. The weekly limit at this level is around 12 hours and 30 minutes.
[09:10.510 --> 09:11.750]  I didn't know they did that.
[09:13.170 --> 09:14.250]  It was that loud.
[09:15.190 --> 09:16.030]  It was...
[09:16.030 --> 09:23.830]  It was kind of crazy, because you're used to, like, the normal restaurant atmosphere, but it was like, I can't hear what someone one foot away from me is saying.
[09:23.830 --> 09:36.470]  I think what it was, I think what happened was, it was, this was last Friday night, and I think it was the first night everybody, like, came out from hibernation and was like, I want to reclaim my life and have a night out on the town.
[09:36.770 --> 09:43.090]  And I just felt like everybody in Austin was loud and boisterous and, like, defiant all at once. It was fucking annoying.
[09:43.430 --> 09:45.450]  So was it people loud or was it music loud?
[09:45.630 --> 09:46.030]  Everything.
[09:46.310 --> 09:46.970]  Wow, okay.
[09:47.070 --> 09:47.910]  But it was mostly people.
[09:47.910 --> 09:53.310]  The last time we recorded, we should probably say, in the last episode, if some of the audio sounded weird, that's my fault.
[09:53.410 --> 09:56.710]  I set up Geoff at Meg's desk, but I didn't check what was being recorded.
[09:57.110 --> 10:02.850]  And it turns out Meg has, for her streaming setup, she has everything on Discord also is recorded to the file.
[10:03.150 --> 10:10.350]  So anytime Geoff was talking and someone else is talking, it's just, I guess, a shit show of the audio.
[10:10.450 --> 10:13.930]  I can't believe an actual usable episode came out of that.
[10:14.170 --> 10:17.590]  But if sometimes Geoff sounds like he's on Discord, it's probably because that's the feed we're using.
[10:18.410 --> 10:22.210]  And at that point, Geoff, you had no power for, I think, two days, right?
[10:22.430 --> 10:22.590]  Yeah.
[10:22.870 --> 10:24.090]  How long did it go on?
[10:26.450 --> 10:28.690]  So I moved home yesterday.
[10:31.610 --> 10:32.290]  Oh, man.
[10:33.130 --> 10:38.130]  What happened was... and I have an interesting story about how I got my power back, actually.
[10:38.910 --> 10:42.130]  I will say it was through perseverance on my part.
[10:42.650 --> 10:43.450]  And desperation.
[10:44.070 --> 10:46.330]  So that was on, what, like, Thursday, I guess?
[10:46.330 --> 10:49.530]  That day, I moved into a hotel, right?
[10:49.710 --> 10:51.750]  Like, I came over to your house Wednesday night to shower.
[10:51.930 --> 10:54.230]  I brought the family over, like refugees, and we showered.
[10:54.810 --> 10:58.850]  And then the next day, Emily was like, I can't do this.
[10:59.090 --> 10:59.890]  I just can't do it anymore.
[10:59.970 --> 11:03.390]  She's got to, like, get up and go stand on her feet 12 hours a day at a beauty salon.
[11:03.650 --> 11:05.690]  And she has to, you know, look fabulous.
[11:05.990 --> 11:09.350]  And it's fucking impossible in a house with no heat or electricity.
[11:09.770 --> 11:10.990]  And so I was like, got it.
[11:11.310 --> 11:12.510]  We'll get a hotel.
[11:12.690 --> 11:13.330]  Start looking around.
[11:13.330 --> 11:16.930]  There are fucking no hotels anywhere in town at this point, obviously.
[11:17.310 --> 11:18.770]  And so I start to get a little desperate.
[11:19.090 --> 11:22.990]  Millie's mom still has power, so Millie went to stay with her mom for a couple days.
[11:23.250 --> 11:27.110]  And then, luckily, I was able to get a hotel room.
[11:28.090 --> 11:30.910]  And so I was able to find one hotel room.
[11:30.970 --> 11:34.770]  And then while I was checking in, like, four people just walked in off the street and were like, got any rooms?
[11:34.810 --> 11:35.430]  And they were like, no.
[11:35.470 --> 11:36.130]  And they were like, fuck!
[11:36.630 --> 11:37.770]  So I felt pretty fortunate.
[11:38.030 --> 11:39.910]  So then we spent two nights in a hotel there.
[11:39.950 --> 11:41.030]  But that's very expensive.
[11:41.030 --> 11:44.250]  That's, you know, a couple hundred bucks a night was all I could find.
[11:44.670 --> 11:45.650]  And that wasn't sustainable.
[11:46.270 --> 11:52.390]  So I decided on Saturday, there's still no electric company in sight at this point.
[11:52.510 --> 11:57.830]  The city is sending out vague updates like, we restored the power to 50,000 people today.
[11:57.930 --> 11:58.910]  And then that's all you hear.
[11:59.310 --> 12:00.830]  And you're like, well, what about me?
[12:00.990 --> 12:03.070]  And they're like, we can't give you any update at this time.
[12:03.110 --> 12:04.310]  But we're working on it, you know?
[12:05.210 --> 12:08.090]  And so Saturday, I was missing Millie too much anyway.
[12:08.090 --> 12:11.750]  So we Airbnb'd a place in Mueller, which is over where RT is.
[12:11.990 --> 12:14.030]  Because they bury their power lines there.
[12:14.170 --> 12:15.710]  So you don't have to worry about the power going out.
[12:16.270 --> 12:18.930]  And moved into a house and rented it until Monday.
[12:19.190 --> 12:21.150]  And thought, OK, surely by Monday we'll have power.
[12:21.410 --> 12:22.930]  Still nothing come Monday.
[12:23.350 --> 12:25.890]  Asked if we could extend, stayed till Tuesday.
[12:26.290 --> 12:27.670]  They wouldn't let us stay any further than that.
[12:28.010 --> 12:28.890]  I guess they'd already had it booked.
[12:29.090 --> 12:30.330]  And so Tuesday we were sweating.
[12:30.770 --> 12:34.210]  I rented another Airbnb for Wednesday and Thursday.
[12:34.210 --> 12:38.130]  Because Friday and Saturday we're going to go stay out of town anyway for Emily's birthday.
[12:38.790 --> 12:46.470]  So then I get up Wednesday morning before I go to check into the...
[12:46.470 --> 12:49.350]  No, Tuesday morning, right after I booked the other hotel rooms.
[12:49.790 --> 12:54.510]  And what I'd been doing throughout the day at this point is I would drive over.
[12:55.350 --> 12:59.090]  Because I live across town from RT and from that Airbnb.
[12:59.450 --> 13:02.130]  I would drive across town and sit in my driveway.
[13:03.230 --> 13:05.170]  For four or five hours at a time.
[13:06.150 --> 13:08.270]  Just to see if somebody would show up.
[13:08.350 --> 13:09.990]  And to be there when somebody showed up, right?
[13:10.570 --> 13:13.630]  And so Tuesday morning I go and I drive into the driveway.
[13:13.790 --> 13:15.250]  And I'm sitting in the driveway.
[13:16.250 --> 13:19.750]  And as I go to pull up, I see 12 trucks on my street.
[13:19.850 --> 13:20.990]  I counted. It was fabulous.
[13:21.390 --> 13:25.390]  There were tree trimming trucks, disaster relief trucks, Asplund.
[13:25.610 --> 13:28.790]  There were City of Austin trucks with cranes and cherry pickers.
[13:28.890 --> 13:31.270]  And I was like, it looked like they rolled out a fleet.
[13:31.270 --> 13:33.330]  It looked like the military showed up to fix my street.
[13:33.430 --> 13:34.910]  And I was like, fuck yeah!
[13:35.330 --> 13:37.290]  And so I went. It was so packed.
[13:37.390 --> 13:39.210]  I actually couldn't park on my street.
[13:39.290 --> 13:41.010]  I had to park a street down and walk home.
[13:41.230 --> 13:44.470]  And as I walked around the back side of my house,
[13:44.710 --> 13:49.050]  there was a bunch of dudes with chainsaws on this little area of woods right outside my property.
[13:49.210 --> 13:51.370]  And I walked up to them and I'm like, thanks so much, guys.
[13:51.430 --> 13:52.290]  Really appreciate it.
[13:52.290 --> 13:53.530]  And they're looking at the power line and stuff.
[13:53.610 --> 13:54.530]  And they're like, yeah, no worries, man.
[13:54.810 --> 13:57.390]  And I was like, look, my gate's open. It's unlocked. It's right there.
[13:57.410 --> 13:58.250]  You guys can go right in.
[13:58.310 --> 13:59.190]  And they're like, okay, cool.
[13:59.190 --> 14:01.230]  And then I went into the house.
[14:01.750 --> 14:04.130]  And I was just like hanging out, waiting to see what the power turned on.
[14:04.590 --> 14:05.770]  And I waited for like three hours.
[14:06.110 --> 14:07.190]  And they were still going strong.
[14:07.310 --> 14:09.130]  And I had to run some errands, right?
[14:09.250 --> 14:10.690]  So I ran. And I ran some errands.
[14:10.750 --> 14:11.390]  And I came home.
[14:11.510 --> 14:13.530]  And when I came home, I'd been gone like 30 minutes.
[14:14.090 --> 14:15.290]  All of the cars were gone.
[14:17.870 --> 14:20.390]  The 12 vehicles were all gone.
[14:21.370 --> 14:24.570]  And as I'm driving up my road, I look over to the right.
[14:24.610 --> 14:26.870]  And my side of the street, which was all out of power,
[14:27.310 --> 14:28.530]  everybody's got porch lights on.
[14:28.530 --> 14:30.930]  And I'm like, oh shit, we got our power back.
[14:31.170 --> 14:33.050]  My house does not have a porch light on.
[14:33.390 --> 14:35.170]  I'm like, oh no.
[14:36.130 --> 14:39.350]  And then right past my house, there's like two trucks.
[14:39.850 --> 14:40.990]  I just couldn't see them from the road.
[14:41.270 --> 14:42.410]  There's like two trucks left.
[14:42.410 --> 14:44.850]  And they're just like facing each other, like talking through the windows.
[14:45.050 --> 14:46.050]  City of Austin trucks.
[14:46.270 --> 14:47.730]  And I'm like, but it's raining.
[14:47.830 --> 14:48.510]  It's sprinkling.
[14:48.550 --> 14:49.370]  And I'm like, you know what?
[14:49.410 --> 14:51.690]  I bet everybody else moved on to another gig.
[14:51.770 --> 14:53.250]  They're just left to do my house.
[14:53.390 --> 14:54.510]  It started raining.
[14:54.630 --> 14:57.250]  They probably can't be fucking with the electricity and the rain.
[14:57.250 --> 14:58.630]  I don't know why I thought that.
[14:58.690 --> 14:59.470]  I'm sure they probably can.
[15:00.110 --> 15:02.310]  But I'm like, so I'll just wait for the rain to stop.
[15:02.370 --> 15:03.330]  And then I'll go out and check on them.
[15:03.770 --> 15:05.330]  And I go inside the house.
[15:05.330 --> 15:07.490]  And I sit in front of my window.
[15:07.490 --> 15:08.750]  And I'm just looking out the window.
[15:09.370 --> 15:12.190]  And two minutes after I do that, one of the cars drives by.
[15:12.310 --> 15:13.190]  And I go, oh shit.
[15:13.270 --> 15:13.850]  And now I'm down.
[15:13.890 --> 15:16.890]  I'm from like 12 trucks down to one in the span of like 40 minutes.
[15:17.170 --> 15:21.230]  And everybody in my street has internet or has electricity but me.
[15:21.390 --> 15:23.290]  And I'm like, oh fuck, no.
[15:23.650 --> 15:24.690]  I'm like, I gotta go.
[15:24.850 --> 15:26.870]  I'm gonna go like beg this guy.
[15:26.870 --> 15:28.910]  So I get up out of the chair.
[15:29.110 --> 15:31.950]  And as I'm opening the front door, that guy's driving away.
[15:32.310 --> 15:33.950]  And I just, I didn't even think.
[15:34.210 --> 15:36.170]  I just panic ran.
[15:36.730 --> 15:38.250]  Booked it like Forrest Gump.
[15:38.430 --> 15:40.610]  Straight at the truck as it's driving down the street.
[15:40.910 --> 15:41.990]  And I'm like, wait!
[15:42.830 --> 15:43.230]  Wait!
[15:44.210 --> 15:44.610]  Stop!
[15:45.390 --> 15:47.590]  And the guy like looks back like I'm a fucking lunatic.
[15:47.650 --> 15:49.130]  And he pulls over in the middle of the street.
[15:49.190 --> 15:50.410]  And he's like, what's up man?
[15:50.870 --> 15:52.130]  Like a big old, he's like Duck Dynasty.
[15:52.310 --> 15:53.290]  Like a dude with a big old beard.
[15:53.910 --> 15:55.170]  And like Ray-Bans on.
[15:56.190 --> 15:57.750]  And he was like, what's up man?
[15:58.110 --> 16:00.070]  And I was like, are you leaving?
[16:00.410 --> 16:01.830]  And he's like, yeah, we gotta go to the next gig.
[16:02.170 --> 16:03.950]  And I'm like, I still don't have power.
[16:04.050 --> 16:05.570]  It looks like everybody else has power but me.
[16:05.650 --> 16:07.030]  I don't know if you guys just miss me or what.
[16:07.050 --> 16:08.670]  But if you guys leave, I'm fucked.
[16:08.810 --> 16:10.150]  Could you just, it's been a week man.
[16:10.190 --> 16:12.510]  Could you just, are you gonna come back?
[16:12.650 --> 16:15.450]  And the guy looks at me and he's like, he just takes me in for a second.
[16:15.530 --> 16:17.590]  And he goes, hold on a second.
[16:17.710 --> 16:20.050]  And he pulls over and he gets out of his truck.
[16:20.110 --> 16:22.150]  And he goes, show me what you got.
[16:22.150 --> 16:25.490]  And I walk him down the street, back to my house, around my backyard.
[16:25.510 --> 16:26.290]  Sounds like my granddad.
[16:26.610 --> 16:26.930]  Yeah.
[16:27.350 --> 16:29.610]  And he goes, and I take him to my backyard.
[16:29.750 --> 16:33.150]  I show him the tree that's fallen and the electric wires are like spaghetti on the ground.
[16:33.190 --> 16:36.730]  And he goes, tree trimmers didn't come back here and do anything with this?
[16:36.770 --> 16:38.630]  And I was like, no, I said hi to him.
[16:38.670 --> 16:39.230]  I pointed at it.
[16:39.250 --> 16:40.310]  And he goes, ugh.
[16:40.990 --> 16:42.050]  And he looked at it for a while.
[16:42.050 --> 16:43.690]  And it's raining the whole time, by the way.
[16:43.770 --> 16:45.210]  And he looked at it for a little while longer.
[16:45.230 --> 16:47.690]  And he goes, he was just real quiet and still.
[16:47.730 --> 16:50.810]  And he goes, all right, man, we'll get you back on.
[16:51.270 --> 16:55.970]  And then he walked back to his truck and he got on like a walkie talkie or some shit.
[16:56.330 --> 16:56.790]  Or a CB.
[16:57.050 --> 17:00.710]  And then three trucks rolled up and there were 12 dudes in my backyard.
[17:00.930 --> 17:02.310]  And an hour later, I had power.
[17:03.190 --> 17:03.990]  That's amazing.
[17:04.190 --> 17:05.810]  It was fucking awesome.
[17:06.170 --> 17:07.710]  It was fucking awesome.
[17:08.090 --> 17:09.330]  But then, I didn't have internet.
[17:09.670 --> 17:11.090]  And so that didn't get fixed until yesterday.
[17:11.710 --> 17:12.650]  Oh, it's back though.
[17:12.890 --> 17:14.370]  Yeah, it's back. I'm recording at home right now.
[17:14.510 --> 17:15.950]  It was cool to see the updates.
[17:16.050 --> 17:17.670]  And I guess it felt way longer to you.
[17:17.670 --> 17:21.230]  But I was surprised that every day we'd get an email from Austin Energy or whoever.
[17:21.330 --> 17:24.310]  It's like, we got 68% of customers back online.
[17:24.390 --> 17:26.110]  And the next day be like, hey, that's 75%.
[17:26.110 --> 17:26.870]  And you were always it.
[17:27.010 --> 17:29.030]  I think it got down to like 88%.
[17:29.030 --> 17:31.770]  And Geoff was in the remaining like, it was like 92%.
[17:31.770 --> 17:33.670]  And you were in the remaining eight or something.
[17:33.990 --> 17:36.550]  I was in the remaining 5%.
[17:38.230 --> 17:39.830]  And today's email was 99.
[17:39.990 --> 17:46.610]  They were sending me texts and emails saying, congratulations, 95% of customers have power.
[17:46.610 --> 17:50.110]  And I was reading it on my phone plugged into a fucking battery.
[17:50.750 --> 17:53.570]  It was pretty impressive though, just to like see the progress every day.
[17:53.650 --> 17:56.730]  It's like, Jesus, they must have reconnected so many people yesterday.
[17:57.150 --> 17:58.690]  But you were just right at the very end.
[17:58.830 --> 18:01.330]  I wonder how long it would have gone on if you didn't run out like a maniac.
[18:01.990 --> 18:04.010]  Well, that's the thing, right? I'd have been fucked.
[18:04.370 --> 18:09.530]  Like, I would have literally been fucked because I have not seen a truck on the street since.
[18:10.250 --> 18:12.610]  Like, I think they fixed this neighborhood and moved on.
[18:12.670 --> 18:14.970]  And I would have just gone to the back of the fucking line, I guess.
[18:14.970 --> 18:19.270]  Even though I had reported it like four times and called, and a lady read.
[18:19.350 --> 18:21.730]  She was like, sir, I have three reports. Let me read them to you.
[18:21.950 --> 18:23.050]  Is this you? Is this you? Is this you?
[18:23.050 --> 18:24.710]  And I'm like, yep, that's me. And she's like, okay.
[18:24.990 --> 18:26.550]  And I'm like, we can put another one in.
[18:26.850 --> 18:32.130]  Even though I did all that, I still have no faith that had that guy not pulled over,
[18:32.470 --> 18:35.750]  if I hadn't desperately like a lunatic chased after him,
[18:37.030 --> 18:38.890]  I would probably be in an Airbnb.
[18:39.110 --> 18:43.170]  I would be in the other Airbnb that I couldn't get a refund for Wednesday and Thursday.
[18:43.170 --> 18:44.730]  That cost me 600 bucks.
[18:44.890 --> 18:45.790]  Oh, man.
[18:45.990 --> 18:49.410]  Yeah, I booked it. And then four hours later, I had...
[18:49.410 --> 18:49.510]  No!
[18:50.050 --> 18:51.510]  And then I was like, please, please.
[18:51.610 --> 18:55.450]  They gave me, it was like $659 and they gave me $59 back.
[18:55.670 --> 18:56.930]  Oh, that's so kind of them.
[18:57.710 --> 18:58.310]  It's a great refund.
[18:59.970 --> 19:03.190]  I had the freeze reveal this bag.
[19:04.190 --> 19:04.310]  What?
[19:04.330 --> 19:05.910]  It's a bag of soil that I threw.
[19:07.550 --> 19:11.530]  So basically that the freeze collapsed on my plants and it allowed me to see this bag.
[19:11.530 --> 19:12.990]  I was like, oh, I remember that.
[19:13.050 --> 19:14.730]  I just chucked a bag of soil back there.
[19:15.010 --> 19:17.750]  Because about a year ago, I tried to plant some stuff.
[19:18.570 --> 19:19.430]  Here's how it went.
[19:20.530 --> 19:21.210]  Didn't take.
[19:21.710 --> 19:21.850]  Yeah.
[19:22.070 --> 19:22.730]  Everything died.
[19:23.490 --> 19:25.110]  Planted some stuff over by the fence.
[19:25.750 --> 19:26.130]  Died.
[19:26.690 --> 19:28.430]  Nothing I plant lasts.
[19:28.830 --> 19:30.610]  Sorry, not to interrupt, but just for the people listening.
[19:30.990 --> 19:31.870]  Not just dead.
[19:32.070 --> 19:35.090]  Like, it looks like parts of Gavin's yard are in Mad Max.
[19:35.230 --> 19:36.010]  Like, that's how dead.
[19:36.010 --> 19:36.290]  Yeah.
[19:36.550 --> 19:37.370]  Zero life.
[19:37.490 --> 19:39.810]  It looks like they were tortured to death.
[19:39.810 --> 19:46.550]  No matter how much water I give them or don't give them or where I put them in the shade and the sun, everything just burns to a crisp and dies.
[19:47.030 --> 19:50.490]  So I'm just like, oh, let me just throw away this depressing bag of soil.
[19:50.670 --> 19:54.710]  I picked it up and it flew out of my hand and slapped straight back down into the ground.
[19:55.590 --> 19:57.230]  The freaking bag grew.
[19:57.710 --> 19:58.690]  I grew a bag.
[20:00.190 --> 20:07.490]  Something in the bag has taken and a root has burrowed through the plastic and straight into the ground.
[20:08.250 --> 20:09.350]  It's a strong root.
[20:09.410 --> 20:10.350]  I grew something.
[20:11.150 --> 20:12.250]  Geoff, did you do that?
[20:12.570 --> 20:13.910]  It feels like he's being pranked.
[20:13.930 --> 20:14.790]  Is that a prank by you?
[20:15.010 --> 20:16.110]  Because if so, that's a great prank.
[20:16.170 --> 20:18.250]  Did you throw a bunch of seeds in my hidden bag?
[20:18.990 --> 20:19.710]  Who fucking...
[20:19.710 --> 20:20.510]  Who could think...
[20:20.510 --> 20:22.630]  Well, things were still weird between us at the time, so no, I kid you.
[20:25.830 --> 20:27.330]  Who thinks of that prank?
[20:27.390 --> 20:28.570]  I wish I was that smart.
[20:28.730 --> 20:29.470]  That's devious.
[20:30.270 --> 20:31.670]  I really want to know what it is.
[20:31.970 --> 20:33.370]  Like, what if it's not a weed?
[20:33.430 --> 20:35.310]  What if it's a rare tree?
[20:35.590 --> 20:36.750]  It could be a rare tree.
[20:36.750 --> 20:41.590]  I think everyone should buy a bag of soil and just plant it.
[20:42.690 --> 20:44.050]  As a bag.
[20:44.390 --> 20:47.810]  You don't know it's not a rare tree, so it's on the table.
[20:48.310 --> 20:49.610]  It's possibly a rare tree.
[20:49.830 --> 20:58.790]  I just can't believe that something that's been hidden under a bush inside a bag with no sunlight can actually survive better than the stuff I want to grow.
[20:59.030 --> 21:00.090]  That's crazy.
[21:00.430 --> 21:02.070]  I mean, that feels pretty par for the course to me.
[21:02.570 --> 21:04.210]  Is the bag still down?
[21:04.490 --> 21:05.610]  Well, I'm not going to get rid of it now.
[21:05.610 --> 21:10.370]  Yeah, now you're committed. Are you going to try to grow it further, or are you just going to leave it?
[21:10.470 --> 21:12.770]  Well, no. If I try to grow it, it will die.
[21:13.130 --> 21:14.810]  I'm just going to leave it exactly how it is.
[21:14.870 --> 21:17.550]  If you make any attempt to take care of it, you will kill it.
[21:17.770 --> 21:20.050]  So you're just going to leave it, and it's just going to continue.
[21:20.430 --> 21:21.110]  I'm going to leave it.
[21:21.210 --> 21:25.050]  Can we get an update in like a year from now? Can you put in your calendar if the bag is still there?
[21:25.230 --> 21:25.910]  Oh, definitely, yeah.
[21:26.070 --> 21:28.590]  If it grows baby bags, I'll buy one for you.
[21:32.810 --> 21:36.330]  We've missed you, Geoff, without internet. We've continued to play Warzone.
[21:37.190 --> 21:39.770]  Oh, man, that sounds cool. I would love to play with y'all.
[21:40.010 --> 21:40.550]  We should play.
[21:40.670 --> 21:41.310]  Are you playing tonight?
[21:41.670 --> 21:42.130]  We could play tonight.
[21:42.550 --> 21:44.490]  We could maybe play tonight, yeah. What time?
[21:44.790 --> 21:45.270]  That's a maybe.
[21:45.370 --> 21:45.830]  Tomorrow night?
[21:46.030 --> 21:49.050]  I can't do tomorrow night. Tomorrow night and Saturday night, I'll be out of town.
[21:49.310 --> 21:49.490]  Okay.
[21:50.050 --> 21:50.730]  We'll figure it out.
[21:50.930 --> 21:53.130]  And then Sunday, there'll be a Super Bowl.
[21:53.130 --> 21:56.230]  We had an all-time moment when we were playing the other night, Geoff.
[21:56.590 --> 22:01.410]  Because, you know, game chat. That was something I was popping into whenever we encounter people, whenever we see it.
[22:01.810 --> 22:07.390]  Because Gavin and I were holding this building, and there were people above us that were having constant conversation.
[22:07.950 --> 22:11.430]  And so I said, let's switch to game chat. And I told Gavin how to do it.
[22:11.790 --> 22:14.630]  And so we're both in game chat, just listening to these two guys.
[22:14.790 --> 22:16.150]  And they had a helicopter above us.
[22:16.490 --> 22:19.670]  So I dropped down an airstrike to try to lure them to us.
[22:19.670 --> 22:22.330]  And they avoided it, but it destroyed their chopper.
[22:22.410 --> 22:24.650]  And they're like, oh, their helicopter's gone now. God damn it.
[22:24.970 --> 22:26.370]  You want me to use my UAV?
[22:26.730 --> 22:29.750]  And the guy's like, nah, wait till we need it. To the last minute.
[22:30.090 --> 22:34.010]  And something that those guys said made me laugh.
[22:34.470 --> 22:36.190]  And I was nervous. Like, I had a little laugh.
[22:36.270 --> 22:38.670]  And I was like, oh my god, I hope it didn't come through.
[22:39.150 --> 22:44.110]  And then a moment later, I hear the guy yell, I see you, Gavin Free!
[22:44.110 --> 22:49.750]  Because Gavin also had the slightest laugh, and it came through, and his name popped up.
[22:49.950 --> 22:52.230]  And they got so aggressive about it.
[22:52.550 --> 22:53.930]  It was fantastic. We've missed you.
[22:54.870 --> 22:57.910]  It escalated until three other teams showed up, and everybody died.
[22:57.990 --> 22:58.310]  It was the best.
[22:59.050 --> 23:01.510]  I was so nervous, I blew our cover.
[23:01.710 --> 23:04.090]  And then I heard a little snort from Gavin.
[23:04.430 --> 23:06.470]  And the guy jumped on it.
[23:06.910 --> 23:08.010]  I just couldn't help it.
[23:08.910 --> 23:09.650]  It's great.
[23:11.170 --> 23:12.190]  That's what we've been doing.
[23:12.190 --> 23:14.810]  Well, you've been struggling with your Air Me Be situation.
[23:14.990 --> 23:16.610]  It sucks that you weren't able to get refunded.
[23:16.750 --> 23:17.610]  Oh, that's okay.
[23:17.830 --> 23:22.190]  I feel like I paid $600 to get my power turned back on, you know?
[23:22.430 --> 23:25.170]  Yeah, I guess if you put it in that perspective, sure.
[23:25.330 --> 23:29.310]  It's all in how you choose to look at it to help maintain one's sanity.
[23:29.670 --> 23:30.110]  That's fair.
[23:30.410 --> 23:32.030]  In these complicated times.
[23:32.550 --> 23:34.090]  I'm not letting it get me down, boys.
[23:34.550 --> 23:36.310]  I said I was going to have a good 2023.
[23:36.630 --> 23:39.430]  I said it wasn't going to start off like dog shit like 2022.
[23:40.130 --> 23:41.430]  I lost my power for a week.
[23:41.430 --> 23:43.470]  I got stitches all up and down my hand.
[23:43.610 --> 23:46.050]  But I have power now, and I have no stitches.
[23:46.370 --> 23:47.990]  So everything's coming up roses.
[23:48.270 --> 23:49.230]  You have a fridge?
[23:49.850 --> 23:50.450]  Is the fridge okay?
[23:51.110 --> 23:51.830]  The fridge is okay!
[23:52.130 --> 24:01.470]  I had to buy an entire new round of ketchup and mustard and soy sauce and fucking milk and sodas and shit.
[24:01.610 --> 24:02.530]  Well, not sodas, but...
[24:02.530 --> 24:04.170]  Can ketchup not be warm?
[24:04.390 --> 24:05.430]  Dude, I don't know.
[24:05.710 --> 24:07.670]  Can ketchup be warm? It's supposed to be refrigerated.
[24:07.790 --> 24:09.390]  I think you can have it out for a bit.
[24:10.090 --> 24:11.050]  Yeah, I don't know.
[24:11.050 --> 24:11.630]  I don't know.
[24:11.750 --> 24:12.810]  For like a week?
[24:13.270 --> 24:13.890]  Once it's opened?
[24:14.030 --> 24:14.490]  I don't know.
[24:14.890 --> 24:19.350]  I just proofed the next Does It Do, the disgusting vomit one.
[24:20.070 --> 24:21.530]  It's a real...
[24:22.150 --> 24:22.890]  It's foul.
[24:23.550 --> 24:24.810]  I haven't finished it yet.
[24:24.950 --> 24:30.930]  I got to the part where it's like one hour later, we're about to start checking it out, and then I had to turn it off.
[24:31.230 --> 24:33.570]  Thankfully, they cut to you when I actually threw up.
[24:34.050 --> 24:39.190]  So you see a lot of gagging, and you don't see any vomit come out of my mouth, which is probably for the best.
[24:40.910 --> 24:41.230]  Disgusting.
[24:41.410 --> 24:46.450]  I was talking to Tyler about it the other day, he was saying he wasn't sure it was an episode, and I was like, hell yeah it is.
[24:46.530 --> 24:47.250]  It's gotta be an episode.
[24:47.610 --> 24:52.370]  And he's like, maybe it'll be cut up and put as a part of another, and I was like, no, no, no, it's definitely an episode.
[24:52.950 --> 24:54.570]  It's just a gross episode.
[24:54.830 --> 24:58.450]  Can I see the cuts of whatever that is? I want to see this so bad.
[24:58.650 --> 25:01.130]  Whatever list I need to be on to see the cuts of this?
[25:01.350 --> 25:03.170]  Have you not seen any of Does It Do?
[25:03.170 --> 25:05.310]  No, I haven't seen any of the updated Does It Do.
[25:05.330 --> 25:06.190]  We've got two episodes.
[25:06.630 --> 25:08.150]  Oh, I need to see them. That's great.
[25:08.150 --> 25:10.270]  Maybe we should show them to you on office day or something.
[25:10.510 --> 25:23.330]  So that's what I was thinking, I'm intentionally not sending them to people that weren't directly in that, because I didn't know if it was going to be a thing where it's like, we want to show you these a certain way, we want you to do this other thing with it.
[25:23.590 --> 25:28.210]  I'm intentionally holding that back, but if you want me to send it to Andrew, I could send them both episodes right now.
[25:28.410 --> 25:28.950]  Whatever works.
[25:29.470 --> 25:30.450]  As long as I get to see them.
[25:30.630 --> 25:32.150]  I think it'd be fun to hear your reaction.
[25:32.490 --> 25:34.470]  Is it like full episodes? How long are they?
[25:34.470 --> 25:36.470]  Yeah, like 12.
[25:36.990 --> 25:38.910]  One's like 8 minutes, I think. One's like 12 minutes.
[25:39.050 --> 25:41.230]  I think they're all going to be around 8 to 15, something like that.
[25:41.330 --> 25:44.650]  So you want me to save these, Gavin, for whenever? When is our next office day supposed to be?
[25:45.050 --> 25:47.910]  It is the beginning of March the 3rd.
[25:48.270 --> 25:51.370]  Okay, I'll avoid watching these for a month.
[25:51.390 --> 25:52.870]  Will this show be out by then?
[25:53.510 --> 25:59.050]  It is slated, and people are going to dog me because it's not going to come out at this time, but whatever.
[25:59.050 --> 26:06.310]  The week of March 13th is supposed to be the first one, but I'm trying to work something in the background.
[26:06.850 --> 26:08.690]  Okay, why don't we move an office day up?
[26:08.970 --> 26:09.930]  Yeah, when would you like to do it?
[26:10.390 --> 26:12.070]  No, we're not doing this.
[26:12.130 --> 26:15.130]  Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Go ahead, Gavin.
[26:15.630 --> 26:16.490]  Gavin, when would you like to do it?
[26:16.510 --> 26:17.870]  Talk about after. Talk about after.
[26:19.810 --> 26:24.110]  I kind of want to move an office day up, so I wouldn't mind moving it up.
[26:24.230 --> 26:26.970]  Yeah, yeah, no, I think that's fine. So when would you like to do that?
[26:27.170 --> 26:28.210]  How about next Friday?
[26:28.210 --> 26:30.210]  Next Friday, the 17th.
[26:31.030 --> 26:31.590]  What do you think, Gavin?
[26:32.070 --> 26:32.870]  Done. Moving on.
[26:33.250 --> 26:33.570]  I'm sorry?
[26:34.050 --> 26:36.010]  Yeah, he's moving on. He's going to talk about it later.
[26:36.230 --> 26:38.250]  Oh, okay. No, he said done. Yeah, moving on.
[26:38.490 --> 26:41.510]  I just don't want to fill the episode with another one of us arranging something.
[26:41.810 --> 26:44.930]  No, no, that's, yeah. Well, you did this. You brought it into play.
[26:45.130 --> 26:47.950]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You should have done that. 17th. Got it.
[26:47.970 --> 26:49.750]  Well, I did it with also saying let's talk about it after.
[26:50.230 --> 26:54.290]  Adding it now, and it is sent the 17th. We've done it.
[26:54.410 --> 26:55.270]  Perfect. Easy peasy.

[28:26.520 --> 28:30.380]  face like a central street that people would walk by. You gotta be careful. You gotta make sure if
[28:30.380 --> 28:34.220]  you're changing in front of a window, you gotta keep it closed. You gotta be safe. Just like you
[28:34.220 --> 28:38.800]  should be safe when you go online, which is why you need a VPN. Because when you go online without
[28:38.800 --> 28:44.400]  a VPN, internet service providers can see every single website you visit. They can legally sell
[28:44.400 --> 28:49.300]  this information without your consent to ad companies and tech giants who then use your data
[28:49.300 --> 28:55.480]  to target you. And I don't want to be targeted by a tech giant or even like mid-sized tech or
[28:55.480 --> 29:00.780]  small tech. Do they have other names other than... I've only heard tech giants. I've never heard of
[29:00.780 --> 29:06.600]  like what you call a mid-sized tech company. My voice just broke there. That was weird. But we're
[29:06.600 --> 29:11.520]  moving on because we are talking about ExpressVPN and how with it you can browse more anonymously.
[29:11.740 --> 29:17.900]  When you use ExpressVPN, ISPs cannot see your online activity. Your identity is anonymized
[29:17.900 --> 29:23.640]  by a secure VPN server. Your data is also encrypted for maximum protection. It's easy to

[29:28.880 --> 29:34.140]  routers, so everyone who shares your Wi-Fi can be protected. I love ExpressVPN because it let me
[29:34.140 --> 29:38.600]  watch the spelling bee and you can access libraries that are outside of your region as far as media
[29:38.600 --> 29:44.420]  goes. Being in Canada, I get a lot of restrictions, but using ExpressVPN, it opens it all up for me.

[30:07.840 --> 30:13.680]  just struggling, whether it be a work or a personal issue, getting back to a place where you feel good
[30:13.680 --> 30:17.860]  can be so difficult and it just makes the day-to-day tasks so much more challenging, or at
[30:17.860 --> 30:22.200]  least that's how it is for me. And not having a system in place or ways to get back to that point
[30:22.580 --> 30:27.420]  can make that experience so much harder to get to. When you're at your best, you can do great
[30:27.420 --> 30:31.640]  things, but sometimes life gets you bogged down and you may feel overwhelmed or like you're not
[30:31.640 --> 30:35.820]  showing up in the way that you'd want to. Working with a therapist can help you get closer to the
[30:35.820 --> 30:40.240]  best version of you, because when you feel empowered, you're more prepared to take on
[30:40.240 --> 30:44.620]  everything life throws at you. I know that's certainly true for me. Therapy has been an
[30:44.620 --> 30:49.940]  amazing tool. It's something that has helped me in so many ways in getting through past traumas,
[30:49.980 --> 30:55.100]  as well as just having systems to approach issues when they arise and dealing with them
[30:55.100 --> 31:00.340]  in much healthier ways. So if you're thinking of giving therapy a try, BetterHelp is a great

[31:28.220 --> 31:34.800]  Do you ever just do something in public that is like you autopilot and do it and then you
[31:34.800 --> 31:40.300]  realize it's really inappropriate? Yes. I burp and fart loudly all the time now, thanks to the
[31:40.300 --> 31:46.800]  pandemic. When I was working a waitress, I couldn't stop ripping the receipt off other people's
[31:46.800 --> 31:55.860]  checkouts. I just kept doing it. It's like a muscle memory of just like if I was buying
[31:55.860 --> 32:00.300]  something in a different store, I would tear the receipt off because I was so used to doing it when
[32:00.300 --> 32:05.040]  I was working the waitress checkout. It was becoming a real problem for me. I was like,
[32:05.060 --> 32:10.720]  oh, I'm so sorry. I also work in a checkout. Have you had anything like that? No, not that I can
[32:10.720 --> 32:19.680]  think of. Not that it didn't go unchecked. I got flagged for... I didn't realize I was doing it,
[32:19.760 --> 32:23.840]  but now that it was pointed out to me, I realized I did it a lot. At Christmas,
[32:24.060 --> 32:28.160]  I kept opening up all of Emily's presents for her when she wasn't opening them fast enough.
[32:34.980 --> 32:38.820]  She'd be like, it's my present. And I was like, oh, fuck. I did it again, didn't I?
[32:39.320 --> 32:42.880]  Yeah, that's funny. Hope that's not something I've been doing my whole life. And it's just
[32:42.880 --> 32:46.700]  the first time somebody's pointed out to me. Did you have something come up, Gavin,
[32:47.000 --> 32:49.840]  that made you think of that recently? Well, basically, when I'm tired,
[32:49.940 --> 32:54.540]  that stuff kind of sneaks in again. I think I was really tired at PetSmart or something, and I
[32:55.460 --> 33:01.500]  reached for it. The only thing that manifested physically was maybe my hand twitched as I
[33:01.500 --> 33:06.760]  stopped myself. And I was like, oh, my God, it's been like 17 years since I worked in a
[33:06.760 --> 33:11.360]  supermarket. But I still was just like, oh, that's so funny. Like, I'm actually worried about it.
[33:11.460 --> 33:15.100]  That really burned in for some reason. Yeah, that's interesting. I've never had
[33:15.100 --> 33:19.820]  that. I've had things that are not socially acceptable to do. When I was like, I don't know,
[33:19.820 --> 33:25.600]  seven, I accidentally stole a Pez dispenser briefly from a store because we're like going
[33:25.600 --> 33:29.380]  to go see Shrek or something. And I got really excited about it. And I was like,
[33:29.400 --> 33:33.240]  I'll just I'll wait at the theater. And I ran out of the store and the alarm went off. And I was
[33:33.240 --> 33:37.120]  like, oh, I guess the alarm's going off. Like, I didn't connect that it was me. And then I got all
[33:37.120 --> 33:41.560]  the way to the theater and realized that I was still holding like the packaged Pez dispenser.
[33:41.740 --> 33:44.900]  And I had to go all the way back and return it. You just thought it was that pair of shorts or
[33:44.900 --> 33:53.160]  Yeah, that was before the shorts. I did have a thing recently talking about my sneak game.
[33:53.360 --> 33:58.680]  I don't think this is shoplifting. Maybe you guys can evaluate this shoplifting or not. We got the
[33:58.680 --> 34:03.240]  Super Bowl this weekend. It's a lot of like grocery stores. They got their deals and whatnot.
[34:03.560 --> 34:09.000]  And there was like this buy three family size bags of chips for ten dollars. And I was like,
[34:09.000 --> 34:15.720]  I'll get two ketchups and I'll get a barbecue. And so I got I went to the store. They didn't
[34:15.720 --> 34:20.320]  have any barbecue in the thing. So I was like, I'll just take I'll get a plane, I guess. So I
[34:20.320 --> 34:27.020]  got my two ketchups and my plane paid for everything. As I'm leaving the store, I realized
[34:27.020 --> 34:31.660]  that they have a display kind of near the front with a bunch of the chips and there's a barbecue
[34:31.660 --> 34:37.420]  in that pile. But I've already paid for my plane. So I was like, oh, what do I do? Is it OK? Is it
[34:37.420 --> 34:43.180]  morally? Is it stealing? If I swap out one of my chip bags because I've paid for all three,
[34:43.540 --> 34:50.580]  but I didn't pay for this specific bag of chips. So if the price is the same, it's totally fine.
[34:50.620 --> 34:53.980]  It's the same. It's the exact same. It would have been the exact same deal. Everything's the same.
[34:54.060 --> 34:58.080]  It's just a different flavor. It's a different bag. I assume you're just messing with their
[34:58.080 --> 35:04.420]  inventory, but it's not. I wouldn't say it's stealing. It's the closest I've never shoplifted
[35:04.420 --> 35:09.140]  anything. And I was like, oh, yeah, as you know, I'm a real sneaky guy. So let's let's pull it off.
[35:09.220 --> 35:14.920]  You shop swapped. Yeah. Let's pull off this maneuver. So I was kind of nervous about it.
[35:14.960 --> 35:18.740]  And I was like, well, looking around and making sure that that there's nobody looking. And I put
[35:18.740 --> 35:23.200]  all the chips down. And then I like I thought I was being real sneaky and I grabbed the barbecue
[35:23.200 --> 35:28.820]  as an interesting. And then like I walked away with my bags and everything, my three chips.
[35:28.900 --> 35:34.060]  And I got in the car and I realized that I had accidentally swapped out the wrong bag.
[35:34.060 --> 35:37.980]  I wanted to get rid of my regular. I had two ketchups and it was supposed to be a barbecue.
[35:38.320 --> 35:43.960]  I instead got rid of one of my ketchups. So now I had one bag of ketchup, one bag of barbecue and
[35:43.960 --> 35:49.500]  one bag of plain. And I walked back in the store and I did it again. I did it nervously. I got rid
[35:49.500 --> 35:55.400]  of my I got rid of the bag I grabbed that I wasn't supposed to. So we're all good. But I ended up
[35:55.400 --> 36:01.420]  having to do it twice. How's that stealing? I think I think that leaving you've walked into
[36:01.420 --> 36:10.000]  weird territory by leaving and then going back. But here's the thing. I'm fine with it. I think
[36:10.000 --> 36:16.880]  you should steal from the grocery store. So I'm okay with it. But I want you to know that I still
[36:16.880 --> 36:23.100]  think it's stealing. Really? Here's the deal. It's not stealing if you haven't left the parking lot.
[36:23.220 --> 36:29.160]  If you're in the parking lot of the store still, you're still a part of the store. I think now.
[36:29.160 --> 36:34.660]  So if you walk outside into the parking lot and then walk back into the store, I think that's fine.
[36:35.040 --> 36:38.440]  Now, if you were to leave the parking lot and then come back, then I think you got to talk to the
[36:38.440 --> 36:42.260]  manager. But I think if you just like step outside for a second and you go like, oh, fuck, I grabbed
[36:42.260 --> 36:46.080]  the wrong thing. I think you go back. That's actually an interesting. I didn't even consider
[36:46.520 --> 36:50.880]  asking one of the staff. Why? Why would the threshold be the parking lot? Because I think
[36:50.880 --> 36:55.580]  it's still a part of the store. Why would the threshold be the store? Why, Andrew, you're asking
[36:55.580 --> 37:00.700]  why the threshold, the threshold for the store would be the store? No, no, I'm saying you're
[37:00.700 --> 37:05.300]  saying the threshold is if you leave the store and he's saying leave the parking lot. What you're
[37:05.300 --> 37:09.900]  saying is an arbitrary line that you've made up. So for you to be like, Geoff, your arbitrary line
[37:09.900 --> 37:15.400]  is ridiculous. The door is the threshold. I know, but make up. I didn't make up the I didn't make
[37:15.400 --> 37:21.460]  up the line. They put the door there. The ATB parking lot is a is ATB property. It's a it's
[37:21.460 --> 37:25.320]  like it's part and parcel with the store. So I still think they're they're connected. That's a
[37:25.320 --> 37:31.260]  good point. OK, so hang on. Hang on. Gavin, do you think that what he did was good or bad or
[37:31.260 --> 37:35.320]  stealing? Where's the line? I think. Yeah, I think you should have talked to someone in there. I
[37:35.320 --> 37:41.700]  think that's just a weird thing to just go in. But I paid. I didn't cost the store any money. I paid
[37:41.700 --> 37:46.900]  exactly what I should have paid. The transaction was as intended. Yeah, but something's missing
[37:46.900 --> 37:52.200]  for them now, isn't it? Well, it's you know, maybe I'm sure people steal chips all the time.
[37:52.200 --> 37:58.420]  Like, I'm sure that my thing, I'm sure I'm not the one in perfection. Wait a second. So so now
[37:58.420 --> 38:03.000]  you're saying people steal chips. So it's OK that you stole chips? No, I didn't steal chips. I'm
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.860]  saying it's OK that I may have messed with their inventory system because I'm sure it's fucked. I
[38:06.860 --> 38:11.420]  mean, every place I've worked at that has done inventory, it's fucked. It never works. I messed
[38:11.420 --> 38:17.740]  with the inventory once I found when I was moving house once I found a pot noodle down the back of
[38:17.740 --> 38:23.500]  my drawers that expired like seven years ago and pot noodles expire like five years after you get
[38:23.500 --> 38:27.980]  them. And I thought it'd be funny just to put them back on the shelf at the shop. So I did. I messed
[38:27.980 --> 38:32.460]  with the inventory on a much larger time scale, but I don't think what I did is stealing. I think
[38:32.460 --> 38:40.060]  it's just potentially giving them a lawsuit. I just put it back with the other pot noodles and
[38:40.060 --> 38:46.260]  all of like the the logo and packaging was different and it was expired by six. It was
[38:46.260 --> 38:51.740]  what if somebody buys that and gets sick and die? You murdered somebody. I assume the barcode
[38:51.740 --> 38:57.120]  won't work. It's way worse than it's way worse than switching out somebody's potato chips.
[38:57.320 --> 39:02.620]  You're a killer. I assume someone would just try and buy it. This one looks different. And then
[39:02.620 --> 39:10.260]  it says like 1997 on the back. Oh, God, I'd be so mad if I bought this. I wouldn't do that now. That
[39:10.260 --> 39:15.280]  was that was actually before I worked at a supermarket. The 20 feet from swapping the chips
[39:15.280 --> 39:19.740]  to walk into the car, I've never felt cooler. And it was such a letdown to realize I grabbed
[39:19.740 --> 39:23.680]  the wrong bag. I swapped out the wrong thing. You always think you're being sneaky when you're not.
[39:23.720 --> 39:28.020]  Do you want to talk about how not sneaky you were last night on Call of Duty? What do you mean?
[39:28.360 --> 39:33.660]  When you tried to sneak out of your previous party? I was playing. I was playing with a
[39:33.660 --> 39:39.600]  different group of people and I was swapping over to join with Gavin and I forgot I hadn't left the
[39:39.600 --> 39:43.840]  session I was previously in. So they were all still with me. And I was like, yeah, I'm going
[39:43.840 --> 39:49.460]  call for the night. I'll talk to you guys later. And I joined Gavin and I brought the entire party
[39:49.460 --> 39:57.040]  with me. And I was I panicked. I didn't know what to do. So I just left the lobby like that was the
[39:57.040 --> 40:01.120]  solution. And I said, I don't know what the name of it. I don't know what the name of the opposite
[40:01.120 --> 40:06.980]  of an Irish goodbye is, but Andrew definitely did it. He just threw everyone into my body and left
[40:06.980 --> 40:15.880]  himself. And I was like, oh, and I couldn't figure out how to leave. So then I got a message
[40:15.880 --> 40:23.100]  from one of the people that was in that party. And they said, it's funny, Gavin joined our session
[40:23.100 --> 40:27.940]  right after you left. They didn't realize I brought them. They thought that Gavin was trying
[40:27.940 --> 40:34.840]  to join me naturally. And it just happened. The timing was off. And so I was like, and then I was
[40:34.840 --> 40:45.040]  like, oh, shit. And he left. So they they think that they messaged me and they're like, yeah,
[40:45.060 --> 40:50.020]  because they had they played with Gavin before I invited them. We're playing. And so they thought
[40:50.020 --> 40:54.560]  that Gavin added them on Call of Duty and just like joined. I don't know what they thought,
[40:54.580 --> 40:59.440]  but they didn't realize I brought them and they completely misinterpreted it. But they listened
[40:59.440 --> 41:02.940]  to the show. So I guess whenever they hear this, they'll realize what happened. You were in my
[41:02.940 --> 41:07.680]  voice chat at that point, but you brought them into my game so they couldn't hear you. No. Or
[41:07.680 --> 41:16.840]  me. Oh, the panic of seeing all four people, just a full lobby. That's brilliant. That's great.
[41:18.060 --> 41:23.760]  I saw something interesting on our Facebook, Instagram. Yeah. So the people have been
[41:23.760 --> 41:30.580]  posting their own life hacks. Gavin life hack. If it's dark, use one of these switches on the wall.
[41:32.940 --> 41:37.580]  I get it. All right. I don't understand what qualifies as a life hack yet, but I'm working on
[41:37.580 --> 41:44.940]  it. There's no need for that. There's no need. It would be your life hack would be if it's dark.
[41:45.260 --> 41:51.200]  Flip the light switch in your room to turn the lights on. I laugh my ass off of that. That's so
[41:51.200 --> 42:01.920]  funny. I'll eventually get one. I just you need to keep writing down everyone you think is one.
[42:01.920 --> 42:04.840]  That's going to be the end payoff. I'm so excited to hear that.
[42:04.900 --> 42:07.460]  I have a few more written down. I'm just too embarrassed to even.
[42:07.760 --> 42:12.160]  Oh, please, please share one. Give us one. Just one.
[42:15.920 --> 42:23.700]  Life hack. Save money on nostalgia. Keep your childhood at 64. Right. This only applies.
[42:24.520 --> 42:34.760]  But right. Like gaming now. Don't sell. Okay. I always sold my Super Nintendo to buy my N64.
[42:34.760 --> 42:40.900]  Right. And then I sold my N64 to buy my Xbox. But all that happened later is I had to buy one
[42:40.900 --> 42:47.880]  again on eBay and it's more expensive. So just save the money up front. Right. Just, you know,
[42:47.900 --> 42:53.540]  do a little bit of extra work. Don't sell the console that you're on now because it's
[42:53.540 --> 43:01.140]  your child. This is for the kids out there. And it might have an emotional connection to you
[43:01.140 --> 43:04.180]  later when you realize you haven't had it and you want to get one again.
[43:08.700 --> 43:12.800]  That's pretty specific, though, isn't it? It was so specific and it's against time.
[43:15.380 --> 43:21.480]  Like buy an N64 20 years ago. If you grew up on the PS5. Right. And you had the best
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.120]  games you play as you play as a grown up. Right. They're amazing. It's unbelievable.
[43:26.620 --> 43:30.540]  I think because nostalgia is so expensive, you can make the saving now.
[43:30.780 --> 43:35.960]  This is the problem. That's my hack. I think the real power of it is when you're a kid.
[43:36.560 --> 43:42.040]  I think the nostalgia, maybe, I don't know. Like, I don't think I'm going to be as into...
[43:42.040 --> 43:46.580]  I love the GameCube and the N64. I don't think in 20 years from now,
[43:46.600 --> 43:50.020]  I'll feel the same about the Xbox One. But you didn't grow up on the Xbox One.
[43:50.020 --> 43:53.800]  No, that's what I'm saying. I'm saying like it's specific for kids. So it's not like you can tell
[43:53.800 --> 43:59.320]  people now who are adults, hey, hold on to that PS5. Yeah, but he's not. He's telling kids today.
[43:59.540 --> 44:04.580]  I'm saying that that's even how narrow his thing like this is the most narrow advice I think he's
[44:04.580 --> 44:08.280]  given. I'd have to look at I don't remember the other ones off the top of my head, but it is so
[44:08.280 --> 44:16.320]  specific. Eric said, Lifehack, it's just weight. What it boils down to is if you're a kid, don't
[44:16.320 --> 44:20.900]  ever throw anything away, because when you're a grown up, the one thing that you threw away
[44:20.900 --> 44:24.720]  or traded away, it's worth a lot of money now and you're fucked and you would have had that
[44:24.720 --> 44:29.340]  money. But now you don't have that money. If I could buy my actual childhood Super Nintendo,
[44:29.840 --> 44:33.860]  I would pay double the price for it. If I could have that specific one, I would love it.
[44:34.140 --> 44:38.720]  I think the nice thing about being a grown up is that you can buy back all the shit you had when
[44:38.720 --> 44:43.600]  you were a kid easily because you can afford it. And it's not grimy and covered in crap.
[44:43.600 --> 44:48.460]  Uh, I think it depends on maybe what you're collecting. Certain things, it can get real
[44:48.460 --> 44:53.520]  expensive pretty quickly. I definitely regret like trading in a bunch of games at GameStop
[44:53.520 --> 44:58.240]  when I was growing up to try to get whatever, like trading in 20 games to get one game just
[44:58.240 --> 45:02.080]  because I didn't have the money for it. But I'd rather have those 20 games at this point
[45:02.080 --> 45:09.180]  than whatever that new release was. So, uh, hack or whack? Uh, I would say definite whack if those
[45:09.180 --> 45:14.980]  are my only two options. Second of all, I want you to reframe this and think about you're on a
[45:14.980 --> 45:21.140]  Skype call with your grandpa as a kid and your grandpa tells you this. Do you think it connects
[45:21.140 --> 45:27.500]  at all? Because it's for kids, but it feels like the most, I'm going to tone you out advice I would
[45:27.500 --> 45:31.680]  get from an old person. Like that's how I'd view it as a kid. Oh yeah. No, no one would actually,
[45:31.820 --> 45:35.780]  well, no one's listening to this. You don't want to hold on to the old thing when there's a new
[45:35.780 --> 45:39.860]  thing out. You don't want to wait like an extra year as a kid. I understand that, but I just,
[45:39.980 --> 45:44.320]  I just wish I'd sold something different. What would you have sold? I don't know, like a lamp.
[45:44.640 --> 45:49.660]  I don't know. Just other shit. I should have sold a bunch of smaller shit. I just really missed my
[45:49.660 --> 45:55.140]  Super Nintendo. Yeah, like a, like a bicycle or something. Yeah. Bike is fair. A lamp.
[45:55.420 --> 46:00.980]  All my parents' lamps. What you've done here. Where'd your, where'd your bedside table go?
[46:00.980 --> 46:11.360]  Uh, what you've done here, it's not a life hack, but it is a life pro tip. Yes. Okay. They're all
[46:11.360 --> 46:16.380]  pro tips. You've created a life pro tip. All of Gavin's advice has been great. It just is not a
[46:16.380 --> 46:22.520]  hack in any way. All right. I should have, yeah. That's why I wanted to keep that one to myself.
[46:22.840 --> 46:30.120]  What if we gave you a prompt and we were like, come back in a week with a life hack for this,
[46:30.120 --> 46:33.640]  problem or this product. Sounds like a great prompt for all of us to have a go at.
[46:33.860 --> 46:37.280]  Yeah, well, then we'd all have to do it though. I guess, how would we come up with the prompt
[46:37.280 --> 46:40.240]  though? Well, we'll have to think about that. Yeah. We'll think about the prompt. The prompt
[46:40.240 --> 46:44.460]  could be anything. It could be garden hose. It could be a cold pizza. It could be, I don't know,
[46:44.540 --> 46:49.020]  whatever, you know, Eric could come up with a prompt. Okay. I think we can come up with solutions.
[46:49.380 --> 46:55.700]  I, okay. I'll try to think of a prompt. I don't really don't see Simon as Eric.
[46:55.700 --> 47:04.440]  I, so far I was given garden hose or cold pizza. Yeah, cool. So you want us to come up with a
[47:04.440 --> 47:09.500]  garden hose life hack? No, I don't. No, you said. I think you do. I could probably do that. I'm
[47:09.500 --> 47:14.680]  pretty sure. I think Geoff just has a garden hose life hack and he's trying to steer it to that.
[47:14.680 --> 47:18.760]  Yeah, I think so too. So he can establish his great life hack. No, I don't. I don't have any.
[47:19.500 --> 47:26.500]  The first thing I would do would be to Google garden hose life hack. Garden hose. I think that
[47:26.500 --> 47:33.180]  the thing that's special about these life hacks, especially Gavin's life hacks is that they feel
[47:34.480 --> 47:40.060]  like they are solving a problem that is apparently unique to him, but not,
[47:40.140 --> 47:46.100]  but also not really solving a problem. So I feel like given a prompt is really narrowing the focus.
[47:46.780 --> 47:51.380]  I really like the way they're rolling in. I really like all of Gavin's life hacks. That's
[47:51.380 --> 47:56.960]  a great sort of advice that you would hear someone say and you'd go. All right, man,
[47:57.020 --> 48:04.020]  thanks. And that's and then we'll go. Nah, these are really, I think so far. I don't remember what
[48:04.020 --> 48:08.680]  your second one was, but the first one was learning classical music, right? Like who composed what?
[48:09.020 --> 48:15.040]  Yeah, this one is save all this stuff. It's really old Gavin trying to teach young like these are
[48:15.040 --> 48:19.600]  things you wish you would have learned. And these are coming up, I'm assuming as you're
[48:19.600 --> 48:25.340]  encountering them in your life. Did you look at your N64 last night was like, man, I wish I didn't
[48:25.340 --> 48:30.000]  pay one hundred fifty dollars or two hundred dollars for this now. Like how did you get to
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.340]  that conclusion? Well, I was just playing Goldeneye again on the Xbox. I was like,
[48:35.360 --> 48:39.620]  I wish I could just play this on my original hardware, see what it feels like. But you don't.
[48:39.720 --> 48:44.400]  You don't actually. Goldeneye on the original hardware plays like shit. I mean, it doesn't
[48:44.400 --> 48:50.100]  play great on even modern. It's having two analog sticks makes it so much better. It's a
[48:50.100 --> 48:55.860]  nightmare with one. Nostalgia makes everything so much better than it was. That's the beauty of
[48:55.860 --> 49:02.020]  nostalgia. That's why you play it on emulators, play it on your Xbox and and play it well.
[49:02.180 --> 49:07.680]  There's a certain feeling you can get, though, of like firing up a Super Nintendo game that you
[49:07.680 --> 49:13.420]  haven't seen or heard in 20 years. And then the music kicks on and you're like, oh, holy shit.
[49:13.420 --> 49:17.180]  You get a ton of memories. That's like the hit I want. That's a little dopamine hit.
[49:17.940 --> 49:23.240]  I get that. But what if you chase that? I feel like that would wear off over time if that was
[49:23.240 --> 49:27.860]  the thing you pursued constantly. Yeah. And it's diminishing returns. Yeah. I think like spreading
[49:27.860 --> 49:32.360]  it out is the way to go with that. I wonder if that would be less rewarding if you could just
[49:32.360 --> 49:38.560]  go into your closet and pull it out. Like if you had your original. Do you think you're wishing
[49:38.560 --> 49:44.220]  you had your old Super Nintendo is better than if you just had it, like the feeling you would have
[49:44.220 --> 49:48.000]  of just keeping it this entire time? I think it'd be pretty cool to be like, that's the first game
[49:48.000 --> 49:54.100]  console I played. Yeah, that's fair. I just I wonder if like the the weight of those emotions
[49:54.100 --> 49:57.400]  are heightened because you don't have it as opposed to if you would have kept it all along,
[49:57.460 --> 50:01.660]  if it would feel as special. Yeah, the possibility of it adding to the experience.
[50:01.860 --> 50:07.080]  Yeah, I feel like nostalgic moments like that, like those little like dopamine hits like you're
[50:07.080 --> 50:11.600]  talking about, they're almost better when they come at you unexpected, you know, like when they
[50:11.600 --> 50:15.900]  catch you off guard. Could you imagine how excited you would have been, Geoff, if we were like, yeah,
[50:15.900 --> 50:18.820]  we're going to watch a movie. We're not going to tell you what it is. And it was Condor Man.
[50:18.980 --> 50:24.640]  And you had no idea. We just watched Condor Man without you having any any point of reference
[50:24.640 --> 50:28.260]  for it. Oh, dude, it would be like, are you fucking serious? Do you guys know I saw this
[50:28.260 --> 50:32.400]  when I was a kid? I love this movie. I remember going to the theater with my mom. We got ice
[50:32.400 --> 50:38.960]  Yeah, no, it would have blown my fucking mind. Absolutely. The first episode just came out where
[50:38.960 --> 50:42.980]  Nick has the laugh track. I liked it a lot. I listened to it and I liked it. What do you guys
[50:42.980 --> 50:47.340]  think? I liked it. I think a lot of the audience are like, we love it. And there's like another
[50:47.340 --> 50:53.620]  50% that's like, it's weird. It's distracting. So I don't know what to do. Keep it. Yeah,
[50:53.700 --> 51:01.220]  it's one of those things, too, where it's like I my informal tracking put it at like 70 positive
[51:01.220 --> 51:09.880]  30 negative or maybe even like 70 positive 20 negative 10 like ambivalent. But I don't know.
[51:09.900 --> 51:15.460]  Yeah, I don't know. I personally enjoy it. Nick is so expressive, too. Like I even heard
[51:15.460 --> 51:21.140]  not only laughs, but I heard like a gasp or two. Yeah. Yeah. I thought it added quite a lot.
[51:21.380 --> 51:27.600]  It is sort of a weird just from a structure perspective of listening to somebody who's not
[51:27.600 --> 51:31.720]  I mean, Nick Nick chimes in sometimes and that's awesome. It's always great when he does,
[51:31.820 --> 51:36.220]  but he's not regularly talking on the show. But you're hearing his reaction to the show.
[51:36.440 --> 51:41.400]  It's like a weird like between line of listening to somebody on a podcast who's not actually on the
[51:41.400 --> 51:45.900]  podcast, but like you're listening to someone else listening, almost like a terrorist house.
[51:46.320 --> 51:49.400]  Well, is that just because we can't hear him there? Because then he would be on the podcast,
[51:49.480 --> 51:54.020]  right? Yeah, I guess so. I think the fact that we can't hear him maybe creates that
[51:54.020 --> 51:56.900]  like layer in my head. All right. Why don't for the next one,
[51:57.300 --> 52:00.080]  we have him unmuted so we can hear him and we see if it changes the vibe.
[52:00.260 --> 52:04.440]  That could be interesting. That's interesting. I like that. Let's do that. Let's do that.
[52:04.560 --> 52:07.760]  And then there's not like two layers to this. Yeah. Let's try that.
[52:09.180 --> 52:13.460]  I like that idea a lot. I hope. I don't think it'd be a good idea. I always liked
[52:13.460 --> 52:18.860]  Tough Crowd, which is this old Comedy Central show. They would have their audience mic'd in a way
[52:18.860 --> 52:23.340]  that wasn't always positive. So like frequently somebody would tell a joke and it wouldn't land
[52:23.340 --> 52:26.580]  at all and it would be very awkward in the moment. Like the comedian would have to acknowledge
[52:26.580 --> 52:32.260]  like that they bombed as part of the show. You don't really get in like talk comedy formats
[52:32.700 --> 52:36.860]  all that much. I don't think we need to go that far, but I'd like to hear Nick laughing.
[52:36.980 --> 52:40.000]  It would be interesting to see how that adjusted maybe how we told stories.
[52:40.240 --> 52:44.000]  It's the same as if as like on the Howard Stern show, you can hear people laughing in the background
[52:44.000 --> 52:50.380]  or like on YMH. It's I think it adds a certain texture to the show and kind of fills it out.
[52:50.860 --> 52:55.840]  I do think that our being able to hear it will change our energy a little bit, which I think
[52:55.840 --> 53:00.040]  will help. And it's not like we just wheeled someone in. Nick is here for every recording.
[53:00.340 --> 53:08.600]  Yeah. Anyway. Fucking better. What if we had a designated laugher who we don't know? They just
[53:08.600 --> 53:14.500]  join the call and then they record their reaction. Andrew, are you a big Colin Quinn fan? I like some
[53:14.500 --> 53:19.440]  of his work. I haven't seen any of his recent stuff. Because you mentioned Tough Crowd. He
[53:19.440 --> 53:25.180]  has a new show on the Howard Stern series channel. Oh, interesting. Like a talk show. I haven't heard
[53:25.180 --> 53:29.700]  it or anything. But if you're a fan, he does a really weird, like almost essay style of standup
[53:29.700 --> 53:34.400]  comedy where his sets are like really narrative based in history, at least the ones I've seen
[53:34.400 --> 53:40.320]  as far as like past in New York. There was great Colin Quinn moment where he did, you know,
[53:40.320 --> 53:44.440]  like when people go on Fallon or whatever and they do like they prearrange what they're going
[53:44.440 --> 53:48.560]  to say and they do their like little bit and then they throw it to a clip. He did his little like
[53:48.560 --> 53:54.620]  set thing and they threw to the clip and it was the exact the clip was the exact material he used
[53:54.620 --> 53:58.900]  for his little bit thing. It was just the same thing doubled up like you didn't know what clip
[53:58.900 --> 54:03.700]  they were going to use. And so he did his like little set and they threw it to be like, watch
[54:03.700 --> 54:09.160]  my special. And it was the exact same material. It just doubled up. It's the most embarrassed I've
[54:09.160 --> 54:15.220]  seen a guest on any of those shows. He's just dead. Well, they came back of like I didn't I
[54:15.220 --> 54:22.940]  didn't know this. Oh, that's awesome. Good book. I had a embarrassing moment the other day where
[54:22.940 --> 54:27.020]  it's like another one of the situations where it's like I swear I'm a normal person, but sometimes it
[54:27.020 --> 54:32.420]  just looks like I'm an insane person where this was like during the freeze and I had was supposed
[54:32.420 --> 54:40.060]  to go to my therapy, but I just decided to do it virtual. And then my internet went like I lost
[54:40.060 --> 54:45.620]  internet because the weather, I guess, and the whole street went off like I had to suddenly like
[54:45.620 --> 54:49.560]  pivot. I was like, oh, shit, because I'm already like 20 minutes into therapy and I didn't want to
[54:49.560 --> 54:53.660]  just like call it a day there because I still have to pay for the whole session. So I text the guy
[54:53.660 --> 54:58.460]  and he was like, oh, yeah, just phone me. And I have no signal ever. So I'm like scrambling around
[54:58.460 --> 55:02.360]  like time's ticking. And I quickly just I'm like, oh, where are my shoes? And in the end, I just
[55:02.360 --> 55:08.120]  shoved on my like yard shoes. I made some ugly shoes on Converse, but I put them the wrong size.
[55:08.120 --> 55:12.360]  They're too big. So I just I just wear them like in the house or like in the yard or something like
[55:12.360 --> 55:17.080]  that. So I just stuff them on and I'm like walking. I'm like walking miles from my house. I was
[55:17.080 --> 55:22.320]  probably walked a mile to get signal. And then I called him again. I've only got like 20 minutes
[55:22.320 --> 55:26.660]  of therapy left at this point, but these shoes don't fit me and they started like rubbing halfway.
[55:26.800 --> 55:31.560]  So I'm like, oh, for Christ's sake. And then eventually I'm just like pacing around, eventually
[55:31.560 --> 55:34.600]  get some signal. I'm calling him and I'm like finishing the end of my therapy, you know,
[55:34.600 --> 55:39.000]  talk about some deep stuff, you know, getting pretty personal and I'm kind of like bummed out
[55:39.000 --> 55:44.800]  and then my freaking foot hurts. So I end up, I just took my shoe off and I'm walking around.
[55:45.880 --> 55:50.280]  And then at that point, someone was like, Gavin? I was like, oh, hey,
[55:50.960 --> 55:56.580]  he was like, I love your stuff. And I was like, oh, thanks, man. Can I have a selfie? I'm like,
[55:56.600 --> 56:02.240]  absolutely. As I'm walking around with my shoe in one hand and my therapist in the other hand,
[56:02.240 --> 56:07.900]  hold on one second, I'll be right back. And I'm like a freaking maniac. I haven't showered or
[56:07.900 --> 56:12.920]  anything. Cause I just like, I didn't expect to be out and about. And, uh, just, I just don't
[56:12.920 --> 56:16.880]  know what to do in that situation. I love, I'm always down to take the selfie. Like I've been
[56:16.880 --> 56:20.800]  asked in toilets and took them. It's not the best place. I mean, wait for me to come out,
[56:21.060 --> 56:25.120]  but I'll still do it. But that was the, that was the one where I was like, maybe I should say no on
[56:25.120 --> 56:32.040]  this one. I look like dog shit. I like a maniac who doesn't know where he is. Oh my God. I can't
[56:32.040 --> 56:37.920]  think of a worse place to take a selfie than in a therapy session. It was definitely a first.
[56:38.000 --> 56:46.960]  I really didn't expect it. I can't believe, dude, that's so funny. I have, I've had similar
[56:46.960 --> 56:52.820]  experiences because I always, I can't think still I have to walk, uh, or ride a bike or something.
[56:52.900 --> 56:57.860]  So I always walk in my neighborhood when I take my, when I do my therapy. Uh, and so I've had
[56:57.860 --> 57:04.040]  twice dudes stopped to say hi. Uh, but nobody's asked to take a photo. And every time I've had
[57:04.040 --> 57:10.480]  socks and shoes on and been like super comfy, the weather must've been dog shit too. Right?
[57:10.540 --> 57:15.720]  Like it wasn't great. It wasn't great. Nothing about it was great, but, um, it was like all
[57:15.720 --> 57:23.100]  rainy and fucking wet and fucking icy probably. Hopefully that guy stays better. And it's also
[57:23.100 --> 57:27.740]  a funny story. Oh man. But yeah, that's gotta be, that's gotta be worse than the one I took
[57:27.740 --> 57:33.620]  in the bathroom at a convention center. Bathroom selfies. I won't do it. I say no.
[57:35.300 --> 57:38.080]  Let's wash our hands. We'll go outside. It's like, it's one of those things where it's like,
[57:38.840 --> 57:43.820]  I, I could say like, this is the, this is like not the place to ask, but I feel like the person
[57:43.820 --> 57:46.500]  already knows that. And they're potentially worried that I'll just pissed off the second
[57:46.500 --> 57:50.080]  I leave the bathroom. So I kind of understand it. So I don't, I don't ever want to be like,
[57:50.160 --> 57:54.560]  no, I don't want to take the selfie. Of course. Of course. Yeah. It's a weird exchange.
[57:54.560 --> 57:58.660]  I think a therapy session, I think just, if you would have said to that person, I can't,
[57:58.720 --> 58:02.140]  I'm in a therapy session right now just to see their reaction would have been great.
[58:03.620 --> 58:08.680]  No, you can't do that to that person though, because that will, that could cause like permanent
[58:08.680 --> 58:15.760]  damage to a person. Really? I think if I, if I were in their shoes and I realized I unintentionally
[58:15.760 --> 58:19.680]  interrupted somebody just who's just walking on the street in broad daylight, right? Uh,
[58:19.680 --> 58:23.680]  with a shoe in his hand or whatever, not looking terribly serious. If I interrupted that person,
[58:23.680 --> 58:27.880]  they were like deeply in a, in a, like a, like a serious moment like that with a therapist.
[58:28.080 --> 58:32.940]  I would be so horrified. I would never talk to another stranger again. Oh man. That's so
[58:32.940 --> 58:36.680]  interesting. Well, this is a person who is, is fine talking to someone who's already on the phone.
[58:36.980 --> 58:40.980]  So they've already got that. They've already got to that. That's true. That's true. That's a good
[58:40.980 --> 58:46.880]  point. That is. Imagine if they would have waited for you to get off the phone. Although, although
[58:46.880 --> 58:52.620]  did you, did you have your AirPods in? Uh, no. Oh, so you were holding the phone to your head?
[58:52.620 --> 58:55.580]  No, no, no. Cause it was in, it was literally in my hand. My, both my hands were full. Okay.
[58:55.700 --> 59:01.900]  Okay. Well then, then yeah, that's hard to, that's hard to forgive. That's pretty rude.
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.160]  I just quickly grabbed shoes and ran out the door. It's pretty rude. You ever see somebody
[59:05.160 --> 59:10.740]  on the phone? Uh, yeah. Don't let them, let them have their conversation. It's fine. It was funny.
[59:11.620 --> 59:17.680]  It was very funny. I can't. Yeah. That's the all time worst timing. I feel like that was such a
[59:17.680 --> 59:22.340]  quick hour. I'm bummed it's over. I'd love to see that selfie. I know.
[59:22.620 --> 59:28.960]  I hope it gets tweeted to me. Yeah, it just fucking flew by today. Didn't it? I didn't even
[59:28.960 --> 59:33.400]  open my phone to look at notes. Although I doubt I have any. I was so excited for this recording.
[59:33.560 --> 59:37.480]  For some reason this last week just felt extra long. I think it was like Saturday when I was
[59:37.480 --> 59:42.100]  like, man, how's it not Thursday already? Felt pretty long for me too. I think next week we're
[59:42.100 --> 59:47.020]  doing two, right? And then we have an office day potentially. So we're gonna, yeah, next Friday,
[59:47.160 --> 59:51.280]  next Friday. Not potentially. Definitely. Well, should we wrap this episode up? Do you have
[59:51.280 --> 59:59.620]  anything before we wrap? I mean, let me look at my notes. I ate Indian food somewhat recently.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:06.580]  For the first time? I hadn't had it in a long time. I had like this big thing of butter chicken
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.880]  and they had like a two, buy one, get one free. It's like a promotion type thing. They were just
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:17.280]  opening, I guess. I don't know. Anyway, I hadn't had it in a long time and I wondered if it would
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:22.060]  fuck up my body, like if I was gonna take a massive shit essentially from eating all this
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:27.780]  Indian food. I anticipated it. Then I had the second one the next day and I was like, oh man,
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:34.300]  this is gonna be crazy. Then that night I realized I hadn't shit since having the food. I think my
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:39.740]  body went into overtime. I had a bath. I fell asleep and I was texting with you at the time,
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:47.020]  Geoff. I woke up in the bath and I thought my body, it was like the hardest it's ever been through. I
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:51.900]  thought nine hours had passed. I thought I had the deepest sleep of my life. I thought I was a
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:57.460]  different person. I was like, I hope the people, I hope my partner isn't worried that like I went
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:03.840]  miss, like I have been gone a long time. Like I might be dead in their eyes. And I looked at my
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.520]  phone, 30 minutes. It was a 30 minute, I fell asleep for 30. I was so, it's the most out of
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:13.500]  it I've been and I'm attributing it to the butter chicken. It was delicious. I would highly recommend
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:20.220]  but my body just was like, couldn't, I don't know. I stopped shitting and I had the craziest nap of
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:24.920]  my life where I thought like I was a different person when I came up on the other side of it.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:31.480]  So I guess I'd recommend butter chicken. You know what's weird? We all had butter chicken last night.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.380]  We had Indian food last night. Really? Yeah. I didn't time travel or anything, but it was very
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:42.100]  good. Maybe tomorrow, maybe have a bath. If you listen, have you shit since you've had the butter
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:47.280]  chicken? I have. I've taken my customary three shits this morning already. Okay, well never mind.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:53.440]  Your body's okay. Speaking of speaking of Indian food, do you know what I miss the most about
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:01.480]  my house? What you sorely, sorely miss after you get used to having it? A fucking toto, dude. Oh my
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:10.860]  god. Cold toilet seats? I forgot they existed. No gentle wash? Oh wow. It's been, I feel like I've
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:15.700]  been shitting in the stone ages for the last week. It's been fucking brutal. I never even think about my cold
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:20.280]  toilets. It's like I'm walking around with Fred Flintstone's prolapsed asshole because I'm just
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:27.420]  shitting like a caveman. You should get one of those like UPS, the APCs, the battery backups for your toilet.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.860]  I love the idea of the power going off and it's saying like, oh you can shit with a warm
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:40.360]  seat for the next 32 minutes. It is the most important thing in this house. Oh my god. Well,
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.800]  okay, so you had to shit on a cold seat. I think a very important question that everybody's
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:50.620]  wondering. What is the sunglasses experience like on a cold seat as opposed to a warm seat? Is that,
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:56.640]  do you feel any less cool? Great question. Dude, I couldn't even, I, it's no, it's, it's creepy. You
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.680]  can't do it. What do you mean? In a cold seat you can't wear your sunglasses? That makes you a creep?
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.860]  Like, I mean a cold seat, like it's 30 degrees outside and you have no power in your house?
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:09.680]  Like that cold? Yeah, there's no sunglasses in that. It's like the two don't, it doesn't work
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.380]  together. It feels, it feels, it feels inappropriate. I haven't been sunglass shitting
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:18.380]  a lot in the last week, I'll be honest. I did three times today. You should pick it up again. No, I'm
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:23.940]  back. Now that I'm home, I'm back. How do you never slip down in the bath and go underwater while
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:28.320]  you're asleep? How do I never slip down in the bath? Because it's a, it's a really narrow tub.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:36.800]  It just, I still can't. Okay, imagine like me in a, me in that bathtub is like a cork half out of
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:43.860]  a bottle. It's not going anywhere. It's secured. It's suppressed on all sides. You're not worried
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:51.760]  about it popping off. It is locked in. And is your head lent backwards or like onto your chest?
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:58.940]  It depends. I will say last night, last night I had a little, little nice little nap and I was in
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:04.700]  more of a stretched out position and it caused the problem. I woke up because I adjusted and
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:09.140]  water shot out the back. I've talked about before. We had some water drippage. I had to get out,
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:14.900]  deal with all that mess, but I'm not going anywhere. It's safe. I understand the concern.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:21.780]  I couldn't be more strapped in. You're a bath cork. I'm a bath cork. Absolutely. I am. Goddamn.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.900]  Oh man. Speak, speaking of strapping in, uh...
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.360]  No, no, I'm ending it here. Don't worry. Speaking of, I just got two last things.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:37.720]  Speaking of strapping in, new season, new season of Survivor starts next month. Let's all watch it
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.420]  together. Yeah. And stay on top of it. And I'm mostly saying that to Gavin who can't manage to
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:47.000]  watch it. We never, I don't think we talked about the end of the last season. I, I'm, I love the
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.660]  ending. Wild. I thought the ending was great. Speaking of endings. Yeah, no, we should end this
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:57.440]  podcast. Uh, uh, speaking of, uh, ending this podcast, I was looking on Reddit today and I,
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:05.060]  somebody posted this old prank wars video from Mega64 with like Gus and, and I and Mega64 back in
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:10.880]  2009. If you haven't seen it, I encourage you to watch it. First off, I look amazing. Uh, but
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:18.640]  so that you can see what appears to be a 12 year old Eric Badour. He is so tiny and fresh faced.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:26.240]  He's like a little baby man. I actually have a weird connection to that video, that moment of
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:33.380]  your guys's response. I was at that PAX. There was a, the last panel of, I think the night it
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:38.140]  happened was a griff ball panel. So I was at it and I was hanging out with you guys. And as they're
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:42.560]  my cousin and my cousin wanted to go back to the hotel. So I had to go back with them, but it was
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:48.440]  around that time. I remember like you guys learning that they had done something to your booth and
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:52.380]  that you're going over to respond. Either you had already known, and you're going over to fuck up
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:56.060]  their booth the way that you would the little posters, or you learned that they did something.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:00.020]  Is one of the two, but I remember, and I missed out. I could have been, I could have witnessed
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:04.660]  you guys, I think putting posters down. I'm very sad. It's one of my great regrets that I couldn't
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:11.580]  have been there for that. How about this? How weird is this? Geoff and Andrew and Eric were all in the
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:17.940]  same fucking room at the same time in 2009 together. That's fucking, it's weird how long our
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:23.540]  lives have rotated around each other. I wonder if there was a one where all four of us were. It would
[01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:28.480]  have to be a PAX. Yeah, no, PAX 2008. I don't know. I don't remember if Eric was at that one, but I
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:34.000]  think you were at that one, Gavin. I was there. Eric, were you at PAX 2008? I'm looking it up right now.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:42.260]  God, I don't remember. 2008. I definitely did 2007. I don't think you were in 2009, Gavin. I don't
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:46.120]  remember you there for that one. Yeah, I don't remember you being there. I do remember that prank
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:50.820]  fights though. No, I might have done PAX East. Maybe. Did you ever go to PAX East, Andrew?
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:55.720]  No, I've only been to PAX West as far as like those conventions go. Andrew's a West Coast guy.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:02.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bye. Okay, end it now. I thought we were waiting to hear if you were looking it up.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:06.660]  But I guess like I don't know what you would have looked up to find that information. To find out if
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:10.880]  he was there. Maybe he is. Yeah, I looked. I don't think I am. I think it's the year before I went.
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:17.980]  Oh, man. Yeah. Well, still, most of us were there. Way to blow it, Gav. Thanks for listening
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:23.560]  to F*** Face. We'll see you next week. Was that it? Did you end it? Yeah, he did. He said thanks
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:28.620]  for listening to F*** Face. That's it. Oh, he just said that's it. Oh, I thought there was like...
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:31.980]  Okay, never mind. Okay, goodbye. We got real quiet. Do the close to action, Eric.
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:37.260]  Well, it's hard. Hey guys, you can follow us on Instagram and on Twitter at F*** Face Pod. You can

[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:54.460]  know why you're listening to this. Call to action. The podcast ended a while ago. Can I ask one
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:58.660]  question and... No! No, no. I know you're going to say no. Can I just... one quick question. One really
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:02.560]  quick because I thought about this and I'm going to forget. If I don't ask now, I'm going to forget
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.880]  to ask. Do we have more followers than Coolio on Instagram? Wasn't that a thing we're chasing? Did
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:12.340]  that ever happen? No, dude. He died. He bowed out of the competition. Well, no. That doesn't... he still
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:20.040]  has a follower count. You can't... No! We can't compete with a memory. Yeah, I think that... compete with a memory.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:24.100]  I'm not... we're not competing. I was just curious if that happened. It's not a competition. It's just
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:29.900]  curious. I don't know. I don't know. I hope not. I think we should... we should switch off Coolio. I think he's...
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:34.220]  he's... he beat us. He won. Yeah. Yeah, he did. Yeah, you get... Andrew, you have one week to decide who we're
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:43.000]  up against next. Oh, great. Okay. Yeah. Thanks for listening. Bye. Does Coolio have a kid? Okay, cut.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:51.300]  Hey, guys. Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:57.940]  Laugh Track Nick is live. The boys talk about throwing poop. What is regulation spoon size?
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:04.380]  Believe it or not, Geoff has teeth issues again. Someone has a foot fetish. And once again,
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.200]  Andrew does not eat the pencil. All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
