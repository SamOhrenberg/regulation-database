[00:15.200 --> 00:19.840]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:20.300 --> 00:26.240]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[00:27.160 --> 00:28.440]  Uh, hello fellas.
[00:28.860 --> 00:30.320]  Hello. That felt weird.
[00:30.320 --> 00:30.660]  How are we doing?
[00:31.160 --> 00:34.260]  That was very sudden. We're just into the show immediately.
[00:34.420 --> 00:36.220]  That was a really good transition by you, Geoff.
[00:36.560 --> 00:37.800]  Oh, thank you very much.
[00:38.260 --> 00:39.320]  What were you talking about before?
[00:39.860 --> 00:41.500]  We were talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:41.500 --> 00:43.780]  And that if he could become more cancelled.
[00:45.080 --> 00:48.360]  Is there any new offenses that could appear out of his closet?
[00:48.580 --> 00:49.460]  And I don't think there is.
[00:50.880 --> 00:54.820]  Like, I feel like everything bad that can come out would have come out by now.
[00:55.220 --> 00:57.300]  Probably just doomed the guy, but yeah.
[00:57.720 --> 00:59.780]  It would be great if it does happen, though. Imagine that.
[01:00.200 --> 01:04.620]  I'm sick of us killing people. I'd rather just, like, some scandal appear.
[01:05.100 --> 01:07.240]  So I'm going to say that there will be no more...
[01:07.240 --> 01:10.400]  Because people are like, oh, they mentioned this person, then they died.
[01:10.400 --> 01:12.720]  You're welling some weird shit into the air right now.
[01:12.720 --> 01:16.380]  What if something really good happened to Arnold Schwarzenegger?
[01:16.520 --> 01:17.040]  That'd be great.
[01:17.240 --> 01:17.800]  What if we talked about him?
[01:17.960 --> 01:18.800]  I would love that.
[01:19.020 --> 01:24.520]  What if we flip the momentum of this and only good things happen to people we talk about?
[01:24.920 --> 01:27.880]  What's the best thing that could happen to Arnold Schwarzenegger at this point?
[01:28.260 --> 01:29.800]  Oh gosh, I don't know him personally.
[01:30.740 --> 01:33.000]  He really likes Humvees, I remember that.
[01:33.360 --> 01:34.340]  He's got a llama.
[01:35.300 --> 01:36.040]  He's got a llama.
[01:36.820 --> 01:38.960]  What if he beats Lou Ferrigno again?
[01:38.960 --> 01:40.980]  In a sudden weightlifting competition.
[01:41.360 --> 01:42.280]  Comes out of nowhere.
[01:42.760 --> 01:43.580]  Him against Lou.
[01:44.200 --> 01:44.860]  Battle 2.
[01:44.980 --> 01:47.820]  I don't know if they've had more than one fight.
[01:48.240 --> 01:49.540]  Here's what I think about that.
[01:49.980 --> 01:53.180]  I think that Arnold's beaten him enough.
[01:53.600 --> 02:00.280]  Arnold has this entire successful, amazing, wonderful life in front of him.
[02:00.480 --> 02:05.940]  Not that Lou Ferrigno also doesn't have an incredibly wonderful, amazing life.
[02:05.940 --> 02:09.260]  But I did the convention circuit with Lou Ferrigno for a couple of years.
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.060]  Let's give him a win.
[02:12.840 --> 02:14.720]  Have you seen Pumping Iron?
[02:15.660 --> 02:16.760]  When I was a kid.
[02:17.140 --> 02:22.560]  It's just a documentary centered all around Arnold Schwarzenegger being better than Lou Ferrigno.
[02:22.640 --> 02:24.380]  And Lou Ferrigno not knowing how to deal with this.
[02:24.780 --> 02:30.540]  Like him trying and just not being able to process that Arnold Schwarzenegger is significantly better in every way.
[02:30.700 --> 02:33.840]  To the point where Arnold just kind of trolls him for like 90 minutes.
[02:34.220 --> 02:34.880]  It's a great documentary.
[02:35.720 --> 02:36.780]  If you're Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:37.100 --> 02:38.400]  If you're Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:38.520 --> 02:39.100]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:39.660 --> 02:42.240]  Hey, what a weird way to start this episode.
[02:42.440 --> 02:44.680]  What are we even fucking talking about?
[02:44.740 --> 02:45.920]  We're talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:46.100 --> 02:46.640]  I'm getting cancelled.
[02:47.520 --> 02:48.640]  He's not cancelled!
[02:48.980 --> 02:50.060]  No, I'm just saying...
[02:50.060 --> 02:50.860]  Stop saying that!
[02:51.080 --> 02:51.880]  He kind of...
[02:51.880 --> 02:55.260]  You said, I hope he doesn't die, but I'll settle for cancelled. Huh?
[02:55.640 --> 02:58.180]  No, well, this was pre-cancelled.
[02:58.620 --> 02:59.280]  His scandal.
[02:59.460 --> 02:59.540]  What?
[02:59.560 --> 03:00.660]  I think he could have been...
[03:00.660 --> 03:09.120]  I think, well, he got... when all the stuff came out that he was cheating on his wife and he had this side kid that nobody knew about, that was pre-cancelling.
[03:09.840 --> 03:13.180]  That was not like in the culture in the same way.
[03:13.300 --> 03:16.620]  So, I don't know. He could have... I feel like that was a cancelable offense.
[03:17.160 --> 03:22.420]  I feel like he kind of did some really shitty things for a brief period and now we're okay. Everything's fine.
[03:22.840 --> 03:24.920]  Do you think OJ would have been cancelled now?
[03:25.460 --> 03:27.560]  Oh, OJ would have been so cancelled.
[03:29.200 --> 03:30.000]  Absolutely cancelled.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.020]  He's still around. He's on Twitter. He's a fucking celebrity. I think he can do cameos and shit.
[03:35.500 --> 03:42.120]  Like, if he was going to be cancelled, why not cancel him now? He's still there. He's still cancelable. He's still playing golf every fucking day.
[03:42.580 --> 03:47.320]  I think everyone's scared. As they should be. Like, the allegations...
[03:47.320 --> 03:47.720]  Of OJ?
[03:48.280 --> 03:50.080]  Yeah, of OJ. Absolutely of OJ.
[03:50.080 --> 03:55.720]  Did you ever hear those, like... OJ had some of the best trolling stories I've ever heard.
[03:56.420 --> 04:02.480]  Before he went to jail for stealing back his own memorabilia from that dude in Vegas.
[04:02.840 --> 04:03.520]  And nothing else.
[04:03.960 --> 04:07.620]  Yeah. That's what they got him for. Stealing his own shit back.
[04:09.220 --> 04:11.860]  In a very menacing and threatening way with guns and stuff.
[04:11.860 --> 04:19.040]  But before that event, when he was just like hanging out, living his best life in Florida on a golf course.
[04:20.080 --> 04:23.540]  There was like a one or two year period. I heard this talked about on Howard Stern years ago.
[04:23.900 --> 04:26.780]  Where somebody, I don't know if they ever caught the person who did it.
[04:26.840 --> 04:30.140]  But somebody was flying over his house a couple of times a week.
[04:30.640 --> 04:33.280]  And dropping golf balls over on top of his house.
[04:33.360 --> 04:35.320]  Like hundreds of golf balls on his roof.
[04:35.600 --> 04:38.880]  Just a couple of times a week randomly.
[04:39.480 --> 04:41.300]  To my knowledge, he never caught who did it.
[04:41.300 --> 04:43.200]  And it was just like somebody menacing him.
[04:43.200 --> 04:45.520]  It's funny because that's such a go-to thing for when it's hailing.
[04:45.700 --> 04:47.760]  You're like, oh man, there's golf balls. Oh no, those are golf balls.
[04:49.340 --> 04:51.860]  As a golfer, I feel like he might be okay with this too.
[04:52.020 --> 04:53.280]  Like an initial annoyance.
[04:53.640 --> 04:59.580]  I find OJ so fascinating because it seems like he killed the people that he was accused of killing.
[04:59.820 --> 05:03.800]  I haven't looked deeply in the case, but I just feel that's the sense I get.
[05:03.940 --> 05:05.620]  That there's overwhelming evidence.
[05:05.880 --> 05:06.920]  Should we start this episode again?
[05:07.440 --> 05:09.840]  Why? What's wrong? What's wrong with this?
[05:11.700 --> 05:12.340]  He's fascinating.
[05:13.040 --> 05:16.480]  I feel like if Eric were here right now, he'd be so angry and annoyed with us.
[05:16.700 --> 05:18.440]  He'd be like, what are you doing?
[05:19.520 --> 05:21.060]  Well, I don't know if he wants me to say.
[05:21.500 --> 05:25.460]  Well, we did a whole bit with him, which I assume now we have to save for the next one.
[05:26.460 --> 05:27.840]  He's not here for a good reason.
[05:28.120 --> 05:31.140]  It's not like a bad thing or anything, but he just had some stuff.
[05:31.340 --> 05:32.980]  There's a bit with Eric? Totally makes sense.
[05:33.580 --> 05:35.500]  I have to wait for this bit now? What is this bit?
[05:36.340 --> 05:41.640]  You texted me three or four days ago and said,
[05:41.880 --> 05:46.180]  Hey, man, before the next podcast, could you do one thing for me?
[05:46.940 --> 05:53.240]  Can you go to a grocery store and try and find or purchase the smallest item you could find?
[05:53.900 --> 05:58.500]  And I asked you for clarification. Does that mean cost or does that mean size?
[05:58.580 --> 05:59.840]  And you said size.
[06:01.400 --> 06:08.380]  And so Eric and Gavin and I were doing a merch photo shoot yesterday at RT.
[06:08.780 --> 06:11.940]  And after it was over, we all went to the grocery store together.
[06:13.180 --> 06:15.020]  Gavin, you're missing some context.
[06:15.220 --> 06:16.900]  So this was actually Gavin's idea.
[06:17.600 --> 06:20.280]  And this is Gavin is a lunatic. He's a crazy person.
[06:20.340 --> 06:21.500]  This is your idea, Gavin?
[06:21.720 --> 06:23.100]  This is Gavin's idea.
[06:23.120 --> 06:25.980]  The whole time we were going around the grocery store yesterday looking for shit.
[06:26.060 --> 06:27.620]  You never told me this was your idea.
[06:28.860 --> 06:32.040]  I was referring to this as Andrew's idea this whole time.
[06:32.040 --> 06:32.820]  No, this is Gavin's idea.
[06:32.820 --> 06:35.540]  It was described to Eric that it was Andrew's idea.
[06:35.960 --> 06:39.960]  Oh, no, this is my idea, but I just thought you were saying, because Andrew's not here, that he could be the judge.
[06:40.080 --> 06:42.640]  So I was like, oh, I wonder what Andrew will say about this.
[06:42.700 --> 06:44.220]  Andrew's the one that asked me to do it.
[06:44.400 --> 06:49.340]  When you and I got into the argument over the item yesterday, and I was like, it doesn't matter what you think because you didn't set the rules.
[06:49.520 --> 06:51.480]  I was wrong because you did set the rules.
[06:52.380 --> 06:55.780]  Why would you come up with the scenario and give it to me through Andrew?
[06:55.920 --> 06:58.240]  I'm so fucking annoyed at you right now.
[06:59.200 --> 07:00.860]  Well, Andrew told you to do it, I guess.
[07:00.900 --> 07:01.800]  I didn't know we were going to...
[07:01.800 --> 07:02.040]  No.
[07:02.360 --> 07:04.400]  The only thing I didn't know was when we were doing it.
[07:04.960 --> 07:06.060]  He's an idiot, Geoff.
[07:06.120 --> 07:07.300]  He is so stupid.
[07:07.500 --> 07:08.780]  Oh, fucking God.
[07:08.920 --> 07:10.120]  We're playing Call of Duty.
[07:10.420 --> 07:11.020]  Thanks for the invite.
[07:12.020 --> 07:13.140]  Yeah, you're welcome.
[07:14.740 --> 07:20.840]  And he said, I'm going to go to the grocery store tomorrow to buy the smallest thing I could find.
[07:20.840 --> 07:22.440]  And I said, that's funny.
[07:22.540 --> 07:23.420]  Why are you doing that?
[07:23.480 --> 07:24.840]  He said, just because I can.
[07:25.020 --> 07:25.820]  Like, why wouldn't I?
[07:26.380 --> 07:31.660]  So then we started getting on to like, I wonder what is the smallest thing I would go there for?
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.740]  And then it was like, what is the smallest thing you can get and walk out without a bag and just the item?
[07:37.040 --> 07:38.500]  You're missing a key part of the story.
[07:38.560 --> 07:40.240]  You said you're going to do this the next day.
[07:40.320 --> 07:44.280]  And I said, oh, I also happen to have plans to go to the grocery store the next day.
[07:44.820 --> 07:48.580]  We should do this as a thing and see who could get the smallest thing.
[07:48.580 --> 07:50.340]  And then Gavin was like, yeah, that's great.
[07:50.400 --> 07:51.180]  Let's do that.
[07:51.800 --> 07:55.740]  And then he brought up, should I tell Geoff about this?
[07:55.760 --> 07:57.620]  And I was like, yeah, I'll text Geoff and I'll let him know.
[07:57.940 --> 07:58.820]  And we'll do this thing.
[07:58.900 --> 08:00.000]  It'll be a bit on the show.
[08:00.940 --> 08:05.860]  Then the next day, I didn't plan on bringing this up, but you're a crazy person, Gavin.
[08:06.240 --> 08:08.340]  I need to, I'll drop this in the chat.
[08:08.980 --> 08:12.300]  Gavin sent me, it was the day we were supposed to do this.
[08:12.700 --> 08:16.640]  And Gavin sent me a photo of this, Geoff.
[08:16.640 --> 08:18.780]  I gotta go to our text.
[08:19.460 --> 08:20.860]  I'll just say what it is.
[08:21.100 --> 08:24.600]  Gavin sent me a photo of, because we talked about what smallest things could be.
[08:24.740 --> 08:27.320]  I said, I bet you it would be something in the bulk section.
[08:27.720 --> 08:30.400]  Where you could buy individual nuts or whatever.
[08:30.600 --> 08:34.640]  I would assume that is where the smallest item would be.
[08:35.080 --> 08:40.680]  So the day it's supposed to happen, Gavin sends me this photo.
[08:41.240 --> 08:42.920]  It's just a shelf.
[08:43.280 --> 08:46.040]  It's a shelf of bulk items.
[08:46.040 --> 08:48.840]  You got seeds, you got nuts, you got all this shit I just put in the Discord.
[08:49.240 --> 08:50.160]  Gavin sent me that.
[08:51.040 --> 08:53.060]  And I said, oh, did you get your small item?
[08:53.100 --> 08:53.620]  What did you get?
[08:53.640 --> 08:55.040]  He said, nah, it's just scouting.
[08:55.660 --> 08:57.320]  I was like, what are you talking about?
[08:57.880 --> 09:01.280]  I assumed we would introduce this bit on the episode.
[09:01.960 --> 09:05.700]  And then discuss it, discuss the rules, and then go and do it between episodes.
[09:06.120 --> 09:08.020]  You think this is a two episode bit?
[09:11.400 --> 09:18.880]  Andrew, I walked around for fucking maybe 35 minutes in a grocery store with this asshole yesterday.
[09:19.120 --> 09:20.520]  Having a conversation.
[09:21.100 --> 09:21.820]  What are you annoyed about?
[09:21.820 --> 09:23.740]  Hold on a second, I'm talking.
[09:23.880 --> 09:24.580]  I don't understand.
[09:25.360 --> 09:26.920]  No, I don't understand.
[09:27.140 --> 09:27.860]  So shut up.
[09:28.100 --> 09:35.760]  Having a conversation with this guy about what does packaging count or is it the item?
[09:35.900 --> 09:37.100]  And what is Andrew going to say?
[09:37.100 --> 09:38.960]  And Gavin's like, yeah, I really don't know which way he's going to go.
[09:39.160 --> 09:40.260]  It's your idea.
[09:40.540 --> 09:41.720]  You make the decision.
[09:41.880 --> 09:42.640]  It's your bit.
[09:42.940 --> 09:46.960]  Why did you have these conversations with me as if Andrew was in charge?
[09:47.240 --> 09:48.240]  This is you.
[09:48.700 --> 09:50.240]  This is so confusing.
[09:51.080 --> 09:54.520]  We said, I asked you, I was like, did he say that he was doing it?
[09:54.540 --> 09:55.960]  Because I didn't know if Andrew was doing it.
[09:56.040 --> 09:57.300]  I told you.
[09:57.380 --> 09:58.380]  And I said, I don't know.
[09:58.420 --> 09:59.420]  He just asked me to do it.
[09:59.440 --> 10:00.460]  I assume we're all doing it.
[10:00.500 --> 10:01.540]  And you're like, fair point.
[10:01.840 --> 10:03.240]  Eric, find the small item.
[10:03.800 --> 10:04.020]  Right.
[10:04.140 --> 10:05.160]  So then we all went and did it.
[10:05.160 --> 10:07.340]  And then we were talking about like, I'm not sure what counts.
[10:07.460 --> 10:10.360]  And then we were like, well, let's just have Andrew be the decider on what.
[10:10.560 --> 10:12.940]  Just because I came up with it doesn't mean I'm the judge of it.
[10:13.160 --> 10:13.960]  I don't know what's good.
[10:14.320 --> 10:15.840]  It's your bit, man.
[10:16.640 --> 10:21.760]  At no point did you tell me this was your, you're in the driver's seat.
[10:22.300 --> 10:23.560]  The whole time.
[10:23.860 --> 10:24.620]  I don't have a license.
[10:24.780 --> 10:25.940]  I don't know how to be in that position.
[10:26.080 --> 10:26.900]  I want to participate.
[10:27.340 --> 10:29.280]  Stop getting behind the wheel, asshole.
[10:30.880 --> 10:34.240]  I just wanted to have the idea for the wheel and then be in the passenger seat.
[10:35.760 --> 10:38.400]  Did Gavin let you know, Geoff, that he had already scouted?
[10:38.960 --> 10:40.140]  He had already done research.
[10:40.140 --> 10:40.920]  No, he didn't.
[10:41.640 --> 10:45.560]  He walked into the grocery store as if he'd never looked at a grocery store before.
[10:45.700 --> 10:48.800]  You're all the most stupid people I've ever met.
[10:49.060 --> 10:51.240]  I was up front in every point.
[10:52.460 --> 10:54.940]  I had this idea with Andrew last night.
[10:55.000 --> 10:55.840]  I said that to you and Eric.
[10:55.860 --> 10:56.900]  You never said that.
[10:57.380 --> 10:58.700]  I wish Eric was here.
[10:58.800 --> 10:59.500]  I wish Eric was here.
[10:59.500 --> 11:00.200]  You never said that.
[11:00.200 --> 11:04.720]  Now, it may have been that you said it to him and not me because I went off on my own to try to do this.
[11:05.060 --> 11:07.520]  You guys were stuck in your thumbs up your asses and goofing around.
[11:07.660 --> 11:09.620]  I was trying to complete the task.
[11:09.920 --> 11:13.380]  Well, in fairness, we were very distracted by the anal numbing cream that we found.
[11:16.040 --> 11:17.420]  There's anal numbing cream?
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.460]  Not in the store, on the way, just in the grass.
[11:20.460 --> 11:30.860]  In the grass on the path to the grocery store was an empty tube of anal numbing cream and another empty tube of Astro Glide.
[11:31.020 --> 11:36.420]  I was never trying to hide the fact that it was my idea or that I'd been to the store yesterday to look around.
[11:36.840 --> 11:39.880]  I literally said these things in public to you both.
[11:40.160 --> 11:42.620]  Not to me. You didn't say it to me. You did not say it to me.
[11:43.460 --> 11:44.940]  Alright, I wish Eric was here.
[11:45.100 --> 11:46.080]  I do too!
[11:46.800 --> 11:49.600]  Although he loves to not side with me.
[11:50.460 --> 11:53.780]  The thing about Eric is he tends to side with the truth.
[11:54.240 --> 11:55.620]  He sides with the funniest, I think.
[11:56.000 --> 11:56.300]  Sometimes.
[11:57.980 --> 12:00.140]  So, we bought small things.
[12:00.640 --> 12:02.020]  Yeah, do we want to do the small things?
[12:03.540 --> 12:05.740]  Should we just go into it then? You didn't want it to be a two episode bit.
[12:06.220 --> 12:10.180]  Well, I don't know why we set it up in one and revealed it in the next.
[12:11.260 --> 12:14.960]  Sometimes we come up with an idea and we discuss the rules and then we do the idea.
[12:15.260 --> 12:15.880]  That's true.
[12:15.880 --> 12:21.040]  When I said let's try shopping from the end caps, you didn't just do it right then in the moment.
[12:21.520 --> 12:25.120]  No, but it just felt like we had already scheduled doing it before.
[12:25.600 --> 12:26.980]  Yeah, man.
[12:28.040 --> 12:33.000]  Listen, when I have an idea for a bit or a game show or something, I'll come to you guys and say,
[12:33.180 --> 12:34.540]  Hey, I want to try something out on Tuesday.
[12:35.180 --> 12:36.440]  And then I let you know what we're going to do.
[12:36.580 --> 12:39.340]  I just get a fucking random text from Andrew that says,
[12:39.440 --> 12:42.120]  Go to a store and buy the smallest thing before the next podcast.
[12:42.180 --> 12:43.600]  I think Andrew messed this up.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.860]  What do you mean? You asked, should I do that?
[12:46.920 --> 12:48.640]  You're like, oh, I said I could text Geoff.
[12:48.740 --> 12:49.980]  You're like, yeah, it's fine. Whatever.
[12:50.560 --> 12:51.480]  Like, let's do that.
[12:52.160 --> 12:55.520]  Also, I played Call of Duty last night for like an hour and a half and you guys were nowhere to be found.
[12:56.020 --> 12:56.660]  I didn't play.
[12:57.020 --> 12:57.420]  Where was the invite?
[12:58.280 --> 12:59.480]  Yeah, thank you for the invite.
[12:59.540 --> 13:03.480]  Yeah, it's held up with all the invites you guys don't send me.
[13:04.320 --> 13:07.220]  So far, I've invited you five times and you've never invited me once.
[13:07.380 --> 13:09.200]  Five times, my ass!
[13:10.860 --> 13:13.360]  In the last 20 years, yes, you've invited me five times.
[13:14.920 --> 13:18.900]  Speaking of COD, I've got a challenge for Andrew.
[13:19.660 --> 13:22.240]  Wait, are we pivoting off? We're not doing small things?
[13:22.360 --> 13:23.960]  Are we going to circle back around to small things?
[13:24.800 --> 13:25.940]  Let's vote on it.
[13:26.060 --> 13:27.760]  What a fucking mess this episode is.
[13:27.860 --> 13:28.840]  Well, Eric's not here.
[13:28.980 --> 13:32.600]  Does anybody have a point this episode? Are we going anywhere with this?
[13:33.040 --> 13:33.520]  What do you mean?
[13:34.100 --> 13:35.540]  How is this different than any other episode?
[13:35.780 --> 13:36.620]  I don't know, man.
[13:36.800 --> 13:37.500]  This feels on par.
[13:37.500 --> 13:38.980]  I usually have an idea where we're headed.
[13:41.480 --> 13:44.420]  Let's finish the small thing before we move on to the COD.
[13:44.480 --> 13:45.460]  I'll get my small thing ready.
[13:45.920 --> 13:48.480]  Do you know what Gavin's small thing is, Geoff?
[13:48.680 --> 13:52.760]  I was shopping with him! I know what his is, I know what Eric's is, I know the whole fucking bit.
[13:53.020 --> 13:55.080]  Except what the bit is and who made it.
[13:55.240 --> 13:57.540]  See, now that's weird to me, Gavin, that you would allow this.
[13:57.600 --> 14:03.400]  Because I feel like the entire point of this whole bit is that we reveal to each other and react in the moment to the small thing.
[14:03.420 --> 14:05.120]  You know more about the bit than I do!
[14:05.980 --> 14:09.740]  I just had a stupid idea! You're the one who turned it into a challenge and a bit!
[14:10.180 --> 14:10.800]  I'm not even-
[14:10.800 --> 14:11.560]  I need you for the rules!
[14:12.060 --> 14:16.200]  No, we were 50-50 though, I was like, ah, that'd be fun, I'm gonna do that, should we do this as a thing?
[14:16.240 --> 14:17.220]  You're like, yeah, we should do it as a thing!
[14:17.220 --> 14:21.820]  You can't shit this into the universe and expect me to know all the magic rules that you didn't say!
[14:22.180 --> 14:26.720]  Well, no, but I just, I feel like as somebody who has done, what, a hundred plus episodes of the show,
[14:26.840 --> 14:31.240]  who's done several things, you'd kind of just know that I feel like the structure makes sense.
[14:31.860 --> 14:36.800]  It would feel weird. Name another time where we all know each other's things and then we show each other the things anyway.
[14:36.960 --> 14:38.880]  It's never happened. There's never been a thing.
[14:39.320 --> 14:43.680]  This bit really got away from me. I just, I got really confused and I just couldn't, I didn't know what was happening.
[14:43.800 --> 14:45.160]  Cause I was gonna do a whole thing-
[14:45.160 --> 14:49.700]  I was just so excited to be just walking through the supermarket with everyone and shopping.
[14:50.060 --> 14:58.360]  You know what's fucking weird? Last week was like the week of weird Gavin. You're just as weird this week but in a totally different way.
[14:58.580 --> 15:01.220]  It's like you're trying to throw smoke on the foot fetish stuff.
[15:01.220 --> 15:09.140]  By being weird in a totally new way so that we forget about you and celebrity feet and you wanting to suck on what's the fucking,
[15:09.320 --> 15:11.660]  I kissed a girl and I liked it and then I sucked her toes lady.
[15:11.940 --> 15:16.960]  Like, you're trying to confuse us with this nonsense. I'm not gonna forget about it though.
[15:17.640 --> 15:21.320]  He was such a weird guy, he almost made me a weird guy.
[15:21.720 --> 15:27.060]  Cause I was talking to other people about how Gavin's a weird foot guy now and it came out of nowhere.
[15:27.060 --> 15:32.020]  And I was like, he found a pair of feet that he thinks are great feet.
[15:32.120 --> 15:33.280]  He thinks these are a great pair of feet.
[15:33.580 --> 15:39.280]  And I almost instinctually sent them the feet and then I realized then I would be a weird feet guy.
[15:39.660 --> 15:41.140]  So I can't forward it.
[15:41.140 --> 15:42.020]  That's how it starts.
[15:42.660 --> 15:42.700]  Yeah.
[15:43.220 --> 15:47.580]  So I just had to, I mean this is, I'm in complete agreement with you Geoff.
[15:47.700 --> 15:51.300]  Gavin is, this is a weird Gavin but in a completely different way.
[15:51.300 --> 15:57.940]  He's like a, he's like a last of us style foot fetish fungus trying to infect the rest of the earth.
[15:59.220 --> 16:03.060]  That was old Gavin. I don't know what this current, this is just chaotic mess.
[16:03.260 --> 16:05.880]  He's obfuscation free is what his name is.
[16:06.220 --> 16:12.360]  Okay, let me put it to the totally normal geniuses. How do you want to do this? How should we have done this bit?
[16:12.780 --> 16:19.740]  I think how we should have done it is we all do it independently and then we reveal our items at the same time and discuss what our process was.
[16:19.740 --> 16:21.020]  Makes sense to me.
[16:21.180 --> 16:22.520]  I know what I did. I know what I did.
[16:22.940 --> 16:23.300]  Okay.
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.480]  I salad creamed it.
[16:27.760 --> 16:29.400]  Is this your first salad cream?
[16:29.660 --> 16:30.660]  That might be it. That might be the one.
[16:32.400 --> 16:36.200]  Well I think by trying not to salad cream it because I feel like you just like blow into stuff.
[16:36.280 --> 16:38.620]  You're like I'm doing it. I'm in the middle of doing it. What are the rules huh?
[16:38.960 --> 16:40.200]  I've got a mouth full of shit.
[16:40.700 --> 16:48.840]  Whereas I was trying not to do that and by not doing that I like obfuscated information and then we just went straight into it.
[16:50.080 --> 16:52.720]  I hesitated on the salad cream and then I went full cream.
[16:54.120 --> 16:55.600]  Oh god damn.
[16:55.760 --> 16:56.520]  This is great.
[16:56.960 --> 17:02.680]  I'm so disappointed because I feel great about the item I got. I really think I'd be shocked if anyone had something smaller than my item.
[17:03.380 --> 17:06.460]  I'd be, Andrew, I'd be shocked if you had something smaller than my item.
[17:06.820 --> 17:07.900]  Really? Okay.
[17:08.860 --> 17:10.640]  I'm going to post mine in the discord alright?
[17:10.820 --> 17:12.660]  Okay. Is Gavin's bigger than yours Geoff?
[17:13.920 --> 17:15.600]  Well I mean let's just watch.
[17:15.600 --> 17:18.340]  Okay. That depends on your rules I guess.
[17:18.920 --> 17:20.320]  I don't know. Is Gavin's big?
[17:20.860 --> 17:22.300]  Okay play that clip.
[17:22.700 --> 17:23.960]  Okay I gotta play a clip now.
[17:24.680 --> 17:27.480]  Okay. Cherry. A singular cherry.
[17:29.060 --> 17:31.640]  Did you just, you just took...
[17:34.120 --> 17:38.480]  Oh okay you weighed it and it came out. That's fancy. Okay I don't have that.
[17:38.480 --> 17:46.700]  Yeah I found a, I was trying to find something like grapes or something that was done by the pound, but by weight, that would register on a scale.
[17:46.820 --> 17:49.560]  And I found that one cherry cost me 12 cents.
[17:50.180 --> 17:52.540]  Which I thought was quite a lot for a single cherry.
[17:53.000 --> 17:54.160]  It feels expensive.
[17:55.340 --> 17:59.960]  So after Gavin bought his cherry, I thought that's brilliant.
[18:00.360 --> 18:05.860]  Because we had been trying to weigh other foods, like a single grape, and it would register but it wouldn't print a ticket.
[18:06.720 --> 18:09.100]  And there's actually a lot of stuff that wouldn't print tickets for it.
[18:09.140 --> 18:11.380]  But for some reason it prints one fucking cherry, right?
[18:11.680 --> 18:17.780]  So I went and found a slightly smaller cherry and scanned that and it was a 9 cent cherry.
[18:18.220 --> 18:19.540]  You got a 9 cent cherry?
[18:20.180 --> 18:23.880]  I was so fucking proud of myself, I went up to Eric and Gavin and I was like, look at what I got.
[18:24.040 --> 18:27.420]  And Eric was like, you can't do that. He got legitimately angry with me.
[18:27.500 --> 18:32.700]  And then he and Gavin had a conversation about whether you were going to allow this in the rules or not.
[18:32.700 --> 18:34.060]  And they're like, it's not within the spirit of the competition.
[18:34.220 --> 18:37.920]  Once again, thinking that it was Andrew's fucking thing.
[18:39.360 --> 18:43.520]  Well, I think we just decided we didn't want it to be by the smallest cherry competition.
[18:43.700 --> 18:44.940]  No, but I think that's funny too.
[18:44.940 --> 18:46.220]  So Eric just gave me cherries.
[18:47.600 --> 18:49.700]  So that was locked in for me. Mine was cherry.
[18:51.080 --> 18:52.920]  So you had a 9 cent cherry, Geoff?
[18:53.280 --> 18:55.240]  I had a 9 cent cherry, but I found something else.
[18:56.060 --> 18:59.200]  Do you want to reveal the other thing or do you want me to reveal my thing now?
[18:59.540 --> 19:01.900]  I'm trying to take a photo of it and stuff, so why don't you reveal yours?
[19:01.900 --> 19:07.180]  So I went immediately, as I said, my kind of philosophy was I wanted a singular thing.
[19:07.260 --> 19:09.620]  So I went to the bulk section. I looked around.
[19:09.940 --> 19:15.840]  My initial hope, and I thought it would be really funny, is if I could buy a singular grain of rice.
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.160]  And then I was going to try to cook the rice to make like one grain.
[19:19.440 --> 19:23.360]  I also thought about doing that with a coffee bean, but I don't know how to grind that and then turn that into coffee.
[19:23.360 --> 19:28.040]  So I was looking around and I found the smallest thing.
[19:28.120 --> 19:31.640]  You can't really tell what it is, like how small it is in the context of the machine.
[19:32.100 --> 19:35.840]  But I went with chia seeds. I went with a black chia seed.
[19:35.960 --> 19:38.540]  I'll be honest, we also looked at this right next to flax.
[19:38.620 --> 19:42.800]  We also decided that flax seeds would have been amazing if it would weigh.
[19:42.960 --> 19:49.340]  So that was the problem. I don't have a fancy, like it doesn't weigh and print a sticker for you.
[19:49.340 --> 19:53.660]  You write down the number and then you take it to the self-checkout.
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.660]  And I was so worried that the machine was going to lock up because it didn't weigh.
[19:58.700 --> 20:03.540]  It was like error and somebody would need to help. I was terrified of that happening.
[20:03.680 --> 20:06.240]  But I grabbed my seed, I put it in a bag.
[20:06.560 --> 20:09.860]  Very difficult to just get one singular black seed.
[20:09.940 --> 20:13.660]  You can see it on the scale. Went with that.
[20:14.140 --> 20:16.260]  I like how it's an analog scale too.
[20:16.260 --> 20:19.380]  Yeah, we're in the past where I live, I guess.
[20:20.700 --> 20:25.160]  So secured that and I was able to buy it.
[20:25.620 --> 20:29.860]  It weighed out at 0.005 kilograms.
[20:30.660 --> 20:35.240]  10 cents! More than Geoff's cherry. I think Geoff got a hell of a deal.
[20:35.620 --> 20:39.940]  I would definitely take a cherry over my 10 cent chia seed.
[20:40.060 --> 20:45.280]  So I put it on a plate. This is it next to a toothpick for context and scale.
[20:45.280 --> 20:50.240]  That is my one item that I bought from the grocery store. My black chia seed.
[20:50.680 --> 20:52.520]  You're an idiot. Why am I an idiot?
[20:52.940 --> 20:55.800]  Because you also bought a cooked turkey breast.
[20:56.420 --> 20:59.140]  Oh no, I just bought a bunch of other groceries at the same time.
[20:59.140 --> 21:02.220]  Yeah, but the whole point... What do you mean the whole point?
[21:02.660 --> 21:07.060]  The whole point is to go in and buy one small thing.
[21:08.380 --> 21:10.920]  I thought the point was just the smallest item you could buy.
[21:11.620 --> 21:14.380]  Everyone's a total idiot. Myself included.
[21:15.560 --> 21:18.700]  There is salad cream all over all of us.
[21:18.760 --> 21:23.480]  No, I said I was going to the grocery store anyway and I would do the same while I was there.
[21:23.600 --> 21:24.520]  At the time I told you.
[21:24.580 --> 21:29.400]  Yeah, well put it on a different receipt. The whole point is to buy something stupid.
[21:29.940 --> 21:32.920]  There's a single item. My cherry...
[21:32.920 --> 21:38.780]  It's the first time I'm hearing these points by the way, which could have been brought up in his regulations committee with you and he never said that.
[21:38.780 --> 21:43.420]  I said it when you and Eric were going through the checkout together. I was like, no, let's do them individually.
[21:44.060 --> 21:53.660]  And that's why I did mine individually. And anyway, I put my, I scanned my cherry barcode and it gave an error saying minimum receipt amount or something.
[21:53.920 --> 21:59.920]  And the person had to come over and override it. And you could tell she has never done that override before.
[22:00.080 --> 22:04.620]  She was like, huh? And then looked at my cherry just on the thing with a sticker on it.
[22:05.720 --> 22:07.360]  She was like rolling her eyes.
[22:07.360 --> 22:08.780]  You live in my nightmare.
[22:09.060 --> 22:09.600]  It was everything I hoped for.
[22:11.300 --> 22:12.700]  And then I had lunch.
[22:13.940 --> 22:21.660]  I've got to say, Andrew, I think regardless of what Gavin said about you buying turkey with it, I think he won.
[22:21.900 --> 22:24.900]  That is smaller. That is definitely smaller.
[22:25.540 --> 22:28.080]  You won smallest item, but I wanted you to just buy that.
[22:28.780 --> 22:31.200]  Okay, well next time I'm in the grocery store, I'll just buy that.
[22:31.520 --> 22:34.860]  I got the world's smallest battery, but it's still...
[22:34.860 --> 22:40.460]  I mean, it's the size of four of your seeds, but it's still, it's like four times the size of your seed.
[22:40.780 --> 22:43.840]  But then I wasn't sure how you would treat the packaging, Andrew.
[22:44.020 --> 22:45.540]  Do you think that's actually quite a big idea?
[22:45.540 --> 22:48.220]  Well, I don't know. It's your idea. It's your bit. So you tell me.
[22:48.760 --> 22:52.040]  Now, see, I asked him and he said we had to talk to you because this was...
[22:52.040 --> 22:56.580]  I just think that's something that a normal person might walk in and buy.
[22:57.200 --> 23:00.520]  I was worried that you guys would ding me for having it in a bag.
[23:00.600 --> 23:03.460]  I thought you'd count that potentially as the size of my item.
[23:03.460 --> 23:07.660]  See, I didn't get that the point of this, until just now,
[23:07.780 --> 23:11.680]  I didn't get that the point of it was that you had to buy the item by itself.
[23:12.140 --> 23:14.580]  I just thought the item was to find the smallest thing in the store.
[23:14.820 --> 23:16.400]  Yeah, that's how I interpreted it too.
[23:16.740 --> 23:20.320]  And only buy that thing and make a show of buying that thing and saying like,
[23:20.540 --> 23:22.680]  Look at me! I'm buying this tiny, tiny thing.
[23:22.900 --> 23:26.400]  Yeah, I would have loved an episode to discuss all this and then we all just sort of go and do it.
[23:26.520 --> 23:27.520]  That would have been my...
[23:28.460 --> 23:32.420]  That would have been a great way to start this instead of Andrew saying half the rules and go.
[23:32.420 --> 23:35.260]  Shut up. Shut up. If only we had a conversation.
[23:35.580 --> 23:38.760]  Oh wait, no, this did happen where we went back and forth and I said,
[23:38.780 --> 23:40.960]  I'm gonna do this and you're like, yeah, let's do that.
[23:41.040 --> 23:43.780]  And then it's like, cool. Everything was established beforehand.
[23:44.360 --> 23:45.320]  We had to talk.
[23:45.780 --> 23:47.300]  Do you know how this would have worked?
[23:48.480 --> 23:50.100]  How it could have and should have worked?
[23:50.180 --> 23:52.420]  This would have been no issue at all.
[23:53.700 --> 23:57.900]  If you guys liked me enough to play video games with me outside of work,
[23:58.020 --> 24:01.220]  I would have been there and we could have had the conversation in the moment,
[24:01.220 --> 24:03.620]  all three of us, and it would have gotten hammered out immediately.
[24:06.320 --> 24:10.480]  This is where the work friendship thing gets in the way.
[24:10.940 --> 24:14.700]  I will say that you're acting like we've been playing a million games without you.
[24:14.760 --> 24:16.320]  I think there was one night you weren't there for.
[24:16.420 --> 24:19.520]  You've been part of every other Call of Duty session that at least I've been a part of.
[24:19.560 --> 24:20.500]  I find that hard to believe.
[24:20.920 --> 24:24.400]  And to be fair, I did say, should we text Geoff?
[24:24.460 --> 24:26.460]  But you had to get off soon anyway, so we ended up...
[24:26.460 --> 24:29.060]  By the time you'd come on, Andrew would be leaving anyway.
[24:29.600 --> 24:30.580]  It was a very short session.
[24:30.580 --> 24:33.400]  Yeah, it was like 40 minutes. We played like one or two games.
[24:33.720 --> 24:35.220]  I played last night. It was fun.
[24:35.560 --> 24:38.180]  You didn't invite me. You could have texted me. Where was my text?
[24:38.940 --> 24:40.100]  You guys weren't online.
[24:40.540 --> 24:43.540]  No, I always appear offline though. I'm never online. That's not a good excuse.
[24:43.820 --> 24:44.560]  You could have texted me.
[24:45.160 --> 24:49.860]  You're right. I could have. I guess I just felt so discouraged I didn't text you.
[24:50.580 --> 24:54.700]  What sucks about this and how this little challenge went is that there was...
[24:54.700 --> 24:57.760]  Well, I'm just going to get railed again by Eric when he comes back next week.
[25:00.140 --> 25:05.240]  Can we just tell him that it went really well, totally smooth, and he doesn't need to discuss it anymore?
[25:05.780 --> 25:09.520]  He's going to hear this someday. Oh my God. That's so fucking funny.
[25:11.240 --> 25:12.680]  So weird that I don't know why...
[25:12.680 --> 25:17.140]  Andrew, that's a great... I can't believe you got one of your scales to register a single seed.
[25:17.380 --> 25:17.660]  It's fantastic.
[25:17.660 --> 25:19.300]  We were really struggling. We couldn't even get a grape.
[25:19.700 --> 25:22.480]  I tried a peanut. It wouldn't let me buy a peanut.
[25:23.160 --> 25:24.980]  Yeah, you tried two coffee beans too at one point.
[25:25.360 --> 25:30.400]  I would have loved the two coffee beans. Would you have grinded it up and tried to do something with it?
[25:31.020 --> 25:34.120]  Ideally. That would be great. Like the world's smallest cup of coffee.
[25:34.500 --> 25:38.080]  I just think I was helped by having antiquated technology and how to do all this stuff.
[25:38.220 --> 25:43.380]  I mean, I feel like I paid for the bag and not the seed. I feel like it's not aware that the seed is there.
[25:44.100 --> 25:48.080]  But do we want to talk about the other challenge that you tried to pivot into earlier, Gavin?
[25:48.520 --> 25:52.880]  Yeah. So Andrew's very good at Warzone. He wins all the time.
[25:52.880 --> 25:56.640]  He even wins when he's trying to make us both lose by flying us into the gas.
[25:57.040 --> 26:03.320]  I was gonna ask about that. By the way, I'm joking about you guys not... I don't want the audience to think I'm really upset about us not playing Call of Duty together.
[26:03.400 --> 26:07.020]  I'm really just giving you guys a hard time. I very rarely am online playing games anyway.
[26:07.160 --> 26:16.520]  But we did play the other night and we... you had this brilliant idea, Andrew, to get a bunch of gas cans and then fly at the top of the map and just avoid conflict.
[26:17.180 --> 26:23.260]  Until we got to the very end. And then it took me a second to realize you were trying to kill us all.
[26:23.840 --> 26:24.520]  No, I wasn't.
[26:25.120 --> 26:27.320]  I don't believe you. I don't think I believe you.
[26:27.700 --> 26:32.860]  This is what happened. We have lost every combat exchange essentially that we've been a part of.
[26:32.940 --> 26:39.780]  We did good in the bathroom that one time, but when you get to the end and it's in the open, we're not winning any combat exchanges.
[26:40.300 --> 26:45.520]  So the thought was, what if we just avoid combat entirely and try to out-survive everybody?
[26:45.520 --> 26:52.400]  So we hung out in the helicopter, we had gas cans to fill up, and we just floated above everyone until the final circle.
[26:52.920 --> 26:57.100]  Which was very fun, by the way. And we were laughing. It was hilarious.
[26:57.520 --> 27:00.880]  You guys were like throwing mines down at people from the helicopter. It was very fun.
[27:01.260 --> 27:02.800]  And then all of our money.
[27:07.820 --> 27:17.860]  Yeah, it was great. But my thought was, we were near a shopping cart, and my plan was to fly to the shopping cart because I had money from going to all the gas stations.
[27:18.320 --> 27:21.420]  And I was just going to continually buy gas masks.
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.960]  What happens is, once you're in the final circle, the gas fully covers the map, so everyone is dying constantly.
[27:28.520 --> 27:31.060]  And you can kind of delay it a little bit by having a gas mask.
[27:31.060 --> 27:35.680]  So my plan was, go to the buyback station, and then just keep buying gas masks.
[27:35.720 --> 27:39.040]  Because they do not have one near them for where they're at. And we could be near one.
[27:39.340 --> 27:42.960]  The problem was, the gas completely covered everything.
[27:43.280 --> 27:47.580]  I went to the buyback. The buyback was locked down. It would not let me purchase anything.
[27:48.260 --> 27:55.100]  But luckily, I had a self-res, and I had a gas mask, and I think I had like one other... I had like two self-reses.
[27:55.100 --> 27:59.680]  But can I tell you the real... if we would have lost, we won the game.
[28:00.120 --> 28:06.360]  But if we would have lost, what really would have hurt my soul, Geoff, especially, would be the disappointment from Emily.
[28:06.880 --> 28:10.980]  Because while we're doing this, Emily was in the background.
[28:11.680 --> 28:15.720]  And I don't know if she walked up, or if you pointed it out, but...
[28:15.720 --> 28:18.920]  She's watching the whole thing. She's the world's biggest Warzone fan.
[28:19.480 --> 28:21.500]  Well, she was like, what are you guys doing?
[28:21.500 --> 28:26.720]  And she kind of like made fun of the fact that we're just in the helicopter not playing to get to the end.
[28:27.460 --> 28:30.840]  And then, so then I flew into the gas, which made it worse.
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.840]  And you said like, oh, Andrew just flew into the gas. It's gonna get us all killed.
[28:34.940 --> 28:36.400]  We were gonna win, and he ruined it.
[28:36.600 --> 28:40.920]  And then Emily just said, why? Like in such an annoyed way.
[28:41.240 --> 28:43.920]  I was like, no, I can't. I gotta make this work.
[28:44.020 --> 28:47.100]  I cannot have Emily be this disappointed in me.
[28:47.400 --> 28:49.780]  And so I was like frantically trying to use my syringes.
[28:49.780 --> 28:52.120]  Timing out my revives as best as I could.
[28:52.220 --> 28:54.760]  We barely won, but that was the biggest relief.
[28:54.840 --> 28:57.680]  I was like, oh, I did not fuck up in front of Emily.
[28:57.880 --> 29:03.380]  It's because Emily's been watching me lose Call of Duty Warzones for like three straight years.
[29:04.000 --> 29:09.160]  I just love the idea from the perspective of the other team, wandering around as the gas closes in.
[29:09.240 --> 29:11.680]  Like, where are these idiots? Where's the other team?
[29:11.760 --> 29:14.380]  And then they just see a helicopter just take off into the distance.
[29:14.660 --> 29:15.620]  And then they lose.
[29:16.500 --> 29:17.760]  Just complete cowards.
[29:17.760 --> 29:20.160]  I don't think you or Gavin shot at anybody.
[29:20.320 --> 29:22.780]  I had maybe one kill. We did nothing.
[29:22.920 --> 29:23.880]  We just lived.
[29:24.280 --> 29:25.880]  I threw shit. Mainly.
[29:26.340 --> 29:27.100]  So that was our win.
[29:27.160 --> 29:29.220]  But you had an idea for a challenge, Gavin.
[29:29.780 --> 29:31.320]  Well, Andrew's so damn good.
[29:31.800 --> 29:32.700]  I'm not. Yeah, he is.
[29:32.820 --> 29:35.020]  He's very, very good at games. Constant wins.
[29:35.200 --> 29:42.100]  So I thought, I wonder, you know, the elite controller comes with those stupid, like, slightly taller thumbsticks.
[29:42.560 --> 29:42.680]  Yeah.
[29:42.960 --> 29:45.340]  I thought, could he win with those on?
[29:45.340 --> 29:49.780]  And then I thought, what if every time he wins, his thumbsticks get a little bit longer?
[29:54.160 --> 29:56.280]  Let me post something that I've done in Slack.
[29:56.280 --> 29:57.800]  Oh, I'm so excited to see.
[29:58.720 --> 30:00.560]  So I'm starting at, like, one inch.
[30:02.100 --> 30:03.180]  Let me drop this in.
[30:03.700 --> 30:04.600]  Is it going to be too powerful?
[30:05.160 --> 30:07.380]  It's definitely too powerful for Discord. This is going in Slack.
[30:07.740 --> 30:07.980]  Okay.
[30:08.400 --> 30:08.600]  Alright.
[30:09.540 --> 30:11.740]  When you see it, everyone play this at the same time.
[30:11.780 --> 30:13.760]  Oh, it's video. Okay. Are you ready, Geoff?
[30:14.080 --> 30:14.340]  Yes.
[30:14.340 --> 30:16.140]  Three, two, one, play.
[30:19.850 --> 30:22.010]  It's buffering for me. That was a pointless countdown.
[30:22.710 --> 30:24.910]  It's going for me. Oh my God.
[30:26.390 --> 30:28.350]  Is that your 3D printer?
[30:29.090 --> 30:35.270]  It's Meg's printer, but I took use of it and I did my first little CAD design.
[30:39.830 --> 30:41.250]  Does it work?
[30:41.810 --> 30:44.510]  And then I'm going to reveal to you the final stage.
[30:44.510 --> 30:46.680]  If Andrew works his way up through all...
[30:49.170 --> 30:51.550]  This is going to have to go in the Slack as well.
[30:51.950 --> 30:54.190]  I'm sorry, audience, if this is not your podcast.
[30:54.530 --> 30:56.790]  That is the funniest little thumbstick in the video.
[30:57.070 --> 30:58.210]  It is just...
[30:58.210 --> 30:59.730]  They just keep going longer.
[31:00.110 --> 31:06.710]  Meg's 3D printer 3D printing, like, 40 thumbsticks in varying lengths.
[31:07.090 --> 31:10.610]  This is the final form, which I hope Andrew can get to.
[31:11.210 --> 31:11.890]  Give that a play.
[31:16.260 --> 31:18.500]  Okay, here we go. Oh my God.
[31:18.640 --> 31:20.380]  Oh my God.
[31:21.020 --> 31:22.420]  Are you serious?
[31:22.940 --> 31:24.040]  How long is that, Gavin?
[31:25.060 --> 31:26.940]  That is as tall as I could print in that printer.
[31:27.020 --> 31:27.820]  That's nine inches.
[31:28.580 --> 31:30.900]  Nine inches? That's so tall.
[31:31.120 --> 31:33.960]  That's why I was like, by the time you get to this one, you're going to be using your chair.
[31:34.920 --> 31:38.140]  Can I get a photo of that for the thumbnail?
[31:38.500 --> 31:39.920]  Yeah. Definitely.
[31:40.740 --> 31:43.080]  And then I've got... I'll post you one more.
[31:43.140 --> 31:44.480]  This is, I think, somewhere in the middle.
[31:44.860 --> 31:46.840]  I was just testing the way it feels.
[31:47.480 --> 31:52.560]  Okay, so I have to win a Warzone game, and I can't, like, hold them like joysticks.
[31:52.980 --> 31:54.540]  You're going to have to use them like levers.
[31:54.880 --> 31:55.400]  Like an analog.
[31:56.100 --> 31:58.880]  You have to put my hands on top of them, right?
[31:59.840 --> 32:02.000]  But how do you do that with your weird claw?
[32:02.300 --> 32:03.840]  Yeah, I'm going to have to adjust how I play.
[32:04.160 --> 32:09.600]  Yeah, I think you're going to have to... The struggle is going to be touching the nubs at the end and also trying to hit the buttons.
[32:10.400 --> 32:11.040]  And triggers.
[32:11.040 --> 32:13.580]  I think that one is three inches?
[32:14.080 --> 32:15.820]  That's going to be somewhere in the middle, that one.
[32:16.100 --> 32:17.380]  Nick is losing it.
[32:17.600 --> 32:18.260]  That is.
[32:18.800 --> 32:24.460]  So I thought, if you can win your way up to nine inches, that would be absolutely incredible.
[32:24.700 --> 32:25.620]  What does he get?
[32:26.980 --> 32:28.940]  I don't know. We didn't talk about that.
[32:29.400 --> 32:30.800]  I'm just... That's a good point.
[32:32.260 --> 32:32.700]  Yeah.
[32:33.020 --> 32:34.420]  It's a lot of work and effort.
[32:34.440 --> 32:35.860]  He gets to pick a piece of gum.
[32:36.020 --> 32:37.020]  Not from bragging rights.
[32:37.440 --> 32:39.200]  For being better at us than video games.
[32:39.220 --> 32:39.340]  Great.
[32:40.500 --> 32:44.040]  What's funny is my controller is already broken on top of these attachments.
[32:44.260 --> 32:46.740]  My left bumper doesn't really work.
[32:47.360 --> 32:49.540]  My right trigger is really squeaky.
[32:49.660 --> 32:50.980]  I feel like that's not his way out.
[32:51.100 --> 32:51.920]  So it's going to be...
[32:51.920 --> 32:53.920]  It's already a fucked up controller.
[32:54.240 --> 32:55.040]  This is going to be insane.
[32:55.180 --> 32:57.060]  So I can't... Just to be clear on the rules.
[32:57.480 --> 33:00.100]  I have to have my hands above the top.
[33:00.100 --> 33:04.100]  I think you have to interact with the stick by the nub on the top.
[33:04.300 --> 33:06.940]  And not by just the neck of it where it meets the controller.
[33:08.800 --> 33:09.200]  Okay.
[33:09.200 --> 33:10.720]  How is that physically possible?
[33:10.820 --> 33:12.000]  Is it physically possible?
[33:12.100 --> 33:14.360]  I'm assuming he's going to be getting shins and feet involved.
[33:15.200 --> 33:16.020]  If I'm honest.
[33:16.160 --> 33:16.420]  Yeah.
[33:17.060 --> 33:20.340]  Okay, so if I could use my chin, then I could use my palm, right?
[33:20.420 --> 33:23.600]  It's going to look like you're making season 2 of Red vs. Blue by the end of it.
[33:24.860 --> 33:30.600]  So if I put my chin on the one that moves forward and backwards.
[33:31.040 --> 33:33.820]  Could I then do my palm on the one that aims?
[33:33.820 --> 33:37.260]  And then my right hand on the trigger?
[33:37.440 --> 33:37.800]  So I could shoot?
[33:37.800 --> 33:38.340]  I think so, yeah.
[33:38.780 --> 33:39.540]  Would that be allowed?
[33:40.380 --> 33:43.380]  How good are you with your toes?
[33:43.960 --> 33:45.520]  You know what? I haven't tried.
[33:45.820 --> 33:46.380]  I might be good.
[33:46.520 --> 33:47.980]  Gavin would fucking love it if I did.
[33:48.220 --> 33:52.000]  Maybe this is just another way for Gavin to sneak feet talking to this goddamn show.
[33:52.260 --> 33:53.360]  Oh, I hadn't thought about that.
[33:53.420 --> 33:54.520]  That's subversive, Gavin.
[33:54.580 --> 33:56.860]  That's a sneaky move by you.
[33:57.960 --> 33:58.180]  Wild.
[33:59.300 --> 34:00.060]  I think I could do it.
[34:00.060 --> 34:03.560]  So it's nine, so it's progressive an inch for each stick?
[34:04.140 --> 34:05.080]  If that's what you want.
[34:05.460 --> 34:10.380]  I figured I would talk to you first and let you pick which iterations you wanted.
[34:10.560 --> 34:14.060]  Like if you didn't want to play nine different games, then maybe we could skip some.
[34:14.200 --> 34:14.900]  I'm fine with doing nine.
[34:14.980 --> 34:16.160]  No, I think I should go the whole way.
[34:16.720 --> 34:16.940]  Okay.
[34:17.440 --> 34:19.680]  So each victory is a new inch?
[34:20.360 --> 34:21.880]  Each victory is a new inch, yeah.
[34:21.920 --> 34:22.740]  I think that's really funny.
[34:23.360 --> 34:25.260]  I've never seen the 3D printer do that though.
[34:25.580 --> 34:29.960]  Where it's trying to print the really tall one and the entire thing is swaying around.
[34:29.960 --> 34:31.420]  Yeah, somehow it's still printing.
[34:31.560 --> 34:32.380]  I don't know how that works.
[34:32.520 --> 34:36.080]  But I was surprised it was able to print that without any supports.
[34:36.500 --> 34:42.360]  So I feel like by the time you're at like six though, that's pretty similar to nine in terms of what you'd be doing, I assume.
[34:42.720 --> 34:45.840]  So it's like, do you want to go six, seven, eight, nine, or just go six to nine?
[34:45.940 --> 34:47.680]  I think I want to go an inch for every win.
[34:47.800 --> 34:49.300]  I think it's funnier that way.
[34:49.400 --> 34:52.540]  Do I have a deadline for once these arrive, how long I have to do this?
[34:53.060 --> 34:53.780]  I don't think so.
[34:54.120 --> 34:54.340]  Okay.
[34:54.520 --> 34:57.020]  Can you stream some of these so we can watch?
[34:57.780 --> 34:58.440]  Uh, sure.
[34:58.800 --> 35:01.760]  Maybe I'll stream like a nine inch one.
[35:01.980 --> 35:02.500]  I don't know.
[35:02.520 --> 35:05.080]  What would be the most interesting one to watch?
[35:05.200 --> 35:05.860]  I don't know.
[35:06.160 --> 35:08.720]  I think it would just be fun to watch the progress as it goes.
[35:08.880 --> 35:16.600]  I don't think you need to stream every inch or anything, but I would like to see some of the progress, not just at the very end.
[35:17.160 --> 35:17.460]  Okay.
[35:18.060 --> 35:18.820]  We'll figure that out.
[35:19.480 --> 35:20.500]  That's definitely doable.
[35:20.500 --> 35:27.100]  I was just giggling while, like when I pulled up the printer, I was just giggling, imagining all the scenarios that are going to screw you.

[36:37.830 --> 36:42.750]  Getting to know yourself can be a lifelong process, especially because we're always growing and changing.
[36:42.750 --> 36:49.530]  I mean, when you go through life, you have different experiences that allow you to see things differently and grow.
[36:49.750 --> 36:58.190]  I mean, I think the notion of being closed off and not trying to grow at all or learn from those experiences would be like the worst way to live.
[36:58.250 --> 37:05.190]  I don't know why anyone would want to do that, but it's important as you go through those experiences to really think about how it impacts you.
[37:05.190 --> 37:15.110]  And generally, I find when I talk to someone about those things, it gives me a different perspective that I don't have or just gives me a deeper understanding of maybe what I'm going through.
[37:16.010 --> 37:24.110]  Therapy is all about deepening your self-awareness and understanding because sometimes we don't know what we want or why we react the way we do until we talk through things.
[37:24.770 --> 37:30.250]  BetterHelp connects you with a licensed therapist who can take you on that journey of self-discovery from wherever you are.
[37:31.110 --> 37:46.630]  Therapy has been something that has been incredibly helpful in my life. It's given me coping mechanisms and just allowed me to talk to someone about issues I had been going through and giving perspective on them that I don't think I would have been able to reach by myself.
[37:47.310 --> 37:55.830]  If you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try. It's entirely online, designed to be convenient, flexible, and catered to your schedule.
[37:55.830 --> 38:02.590]  Just fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist, and you can switch therapists anytime for no additional charge.

[38:15.390 --> 38:24.850]  Who's ready to talk about porn? I know that none of you watch porn, but just in case you have any friends that do, you'll want to pay attention to this.
[38:24.850 --> 38:33.990]  With everything going on in the world, governments have increased their surveillance. They're using your devices to track your location, movements, and in many countries, your internet activity.
[38:34.450 --> 38:42.470]  You don't want to be literally caught with your pants down. And one of the best ways to keep your online browsing activity private is by using ExpressVPN.
[38:43.150 --> 38:52.590]  When you use ExpressVPN, your internet connection is rerouted through a secure encrypted server so you can surf the web anonymously without anyone looking over your shoulder.
[38:52.590 --> 39:03.030]  Look, I know you probably think all you have to do is use incognito mode and no one can see that you've watched every last hentai video on PornHub, but you're wrong.
[39:04.190 --> 39:15.590]  Even when you use incognito mode, your internet provider like Verizon or AT&T can see every single website you visit. And if you live on campus or use a shared Wi-Fi, your network admin can too.
[39:15.590 --> 39:23.570]  To be honest, that's kinda scary. That's why I use ExpressVPN whenever I go online and I recommend all of you do the same.
[39:24.030 --> 39:30.910]  Without ExpressVPN, you're giving people a free license to peek over your shoulder and see all the freaky shit you're looking at.

[39:51.270 --> 39:54.370]  Nick just brought up a great scenario I didn't even consider.
[39:54.530 --> 39:57.110]  These are all solo wins, right? I have to do this solo?
[39:57.250 --> 39:59.850]  I can't be in teams or duos or whatever?
[40:00.710 --> 40:04.450]  I'd say it has to be either solo or trios with us.
[40:04.710 --> 40:05.570]  Or duos.
[40:05.830 --> 40:07.410]  Right, because we're not helping at all.
[40:09.130 --> 40:10.630]  It's worse than being solo.
[40:13.490 --> 40:14.910]  Okay, this is great.
[40:15.650 --> 40:18.770]  Are you going to mail these? When can I expect these?
[40:18.770 --> 40:21.070]  Do I have time to prepare? I don't even know how I'd prepare.
[40:21.430 --> 40:23.630]  I could mail them or you could come pick them up. It's up to you.
[40:23.950 --> 40:26.290]  Yeah, you can mail them. I'm not coming to pick them up.
[40:31.530 --> 40:33.230]  I'm excited. This is a funny idea.
[40:33.610 --> 40:38.290]  I'm excited too. I do think we need to come up with some sort of a prize for Andrew if he's able to complete it.
[40:38.730 --> 40:39.310]  I agree.
[40:39.670 --> 40:41.170]  Because it's a huge, monumental task.
[40:41.930 --> 40:42.930]  Nine Inches is going to be tough.
[40:42.930 --> 40:49.310]  He's about to win Warzone nine more times than I'll ever win Warzone at escalating difficulty.
[40:52.270 --> 40:57.270]  I did ask Gavin how he thinks he would do with the four inch one and his reply was,
[40:57.370 --> 40:59.370]  I can't win on the normal sticks.
[40:59.690 --> 41:02.150]  I've literally never won. I've never started it.
[41:02.930 --> 41:06.150]  I can't use the normal controller that normal people use.
[41:09.450 --> 41:12.130]  We had an office day recently.
[41:12.130 --> 41:13.810]  We did a bunch of stuff.
[41:13.990 --> 41:15.450]  That was phenomenal.
[41:16.090 --> 41:18.030]  We haven't recorded since then, huh?
[41:18.350 --> 41:19.790]  We haven't recorded since then.
[41:20.250 --> 41:22.090]  I had a really funny conversation with Nick.
[41:22.390 --> 41:25.690]  And I'm curious if you guys are in the same boat as me or if this is just a me thing.
[41:26.810 --> 41:31.450]  We did the office day. Nick never posted a link for me to upload my stuff.
[41:31.730 --> 41:33.250]  So he did it the next day.
[41:33.830 --> 41:34.970]  And I put everything in.
[41:35.690 --> 41:38.330]  And I was like, it's all there, good to go, have a nice weekend.
[41:38.730 --> 41:42.770]  Then Nick messaged me early the next week and said, hey, I looked.
[41:42.870 --> 41:44.550]  I can't find any of your files.
[41:45.050 --> 41:46.270]  I thought, oh, that's weird.
[41:46.590 --> 41:48.210]  So I looked and they weren't there anymore.
[41:48.290 --> 41:49.190]  So I don't know what happened.
[41:49.250 --> 41:52.030]  But then I just put them back into the thing they reuploaded.
[41:52.570 --> 41:53.990]  And I apologized to Nick.
[41:54.090 --> 41:54.890]  I was like, I'm sorry that happened.
[41:54.930 --> 41:56.670]  I don't really know what went wrong, but that sucks.
[41:56.990 --> 41:58.950]  I'm sorry I delayed it if I delayed anything.
[41:59.450 --> 42:00.570]  And he said, no, it's totally fine.
[42:00.590 --> 42:03.750]  I was just worried that you had gotten rid of the files already.
[42:04.130 --> 42:06.370]  To which I realized I just had never really thought about it.
[42:06.370 --> 42:10.190]  I haven't deleted a single recording since we started the show.
[42:10.310 --> 42:12.650]  I have all of my recordings still on my computer.
[42:13.330 --> 42:14.990]  Yeah, no, I think everybody should, right?
[42:15.190 --> 42:18.010]  I have every recording and a backup of every recording.
[42:18.070 --> 42:21.010]  I have two copies of everything I've ever made for F*** Place.
[42:21.150 --> 42:23.670]  I've got every recording of eight hours of a fireplace.
[42:28.030 --> 42:29.130]  So none of us deleted.
[42:29.550 --> 42:29.930]  That's great.
[42:30.390 --> 42:30.670]  That's awesome.
[42:30.670 --> 42:31.270]  All on the same page.
[42:31.270 --> 42:32.190]  I was going back through.
[42:32.330 --> 42:36.810]  I found the recording of the first commercial we recorded.
[42:36.870 --> 42:44.910]  We recorded a commercial that will be put on all of the audio for every Rooster Teeth podcast.
[42:45.950 --> 42:48.070]  Can we talk about that for a second?
[42:48.150 --> 42:48.670]  Yeah, absolutely.
[42:49.210 --> 42:50.350]  We were doing the merch shoot.
[42:50.470 --> 42:57.470]  So we have some baseball jerseys and baseball caps that are coming out for F*** Place at some point in the future.
[42:58.210 --> 43:01.830]  And man, by the way, our merch game is strong coming out.
[43:01.870 --> 43:03.530]  We've got some fun stuff coming out.
[43:04.310 --> 43:06.990]  But anyway, it's some really stupid stuff in the best ways coming out.
[43:07.650 --> 43:10.890]  But anyway, so we were doing the photo shoot for the baseball jerseys.
[43:11.010 --> 43:17.410]  While we were doing that, I mentioned I got the file of the completed promo.
[43:17.890 --> 43:19.770]  So I played it and I was like, this is so good.
[43:19.870 --> 43:21.010]  And Gavin was like, it's perfect.
[43:21.330 --> 43:23.390]  I played it and Eric was like, it's terrible.
[43:23.430 --> 43:23.950]  I hate it.
[43:24.030 --> 43:26.650]  And then we played it for Barbara Dunkelman and she hated it.
[43:26.650 --> 43:28.130]  She was like, don't use that.
[43:28.730 --> 43:29.950]  Am I crazy?
[43:30.410 --> 43:31.490]  No, it's great.
[43:31.890 --> 43:32.430]  It's great.
[43:32.930 --> 43:33.930]  Yeah, we're using it.
[43:33.990 --> 43:39.470]  I think it's great if you've already heard this podcast and you already know about it.
[43:39.750 --> 43:44.510]  If you've never heard of us, I don't think it would bring in a single other viewer.
[43:44.650 --> 43:45.970]  I don't care about that, though.
[43:46.010 --> 43:48.190]  Which I think is a total f*** face move.
[43:48.270 --> 43:49.090]  And I think it's perfect.
[43:49.330 --> 43:51.290]  I think, I mean, it's within the spirit of the name of the podcast.
[43:51.290 --> 43:59.050]  Also, to be honest with you, if I heard that commercial, Sight Unseen, I'm immediately rushing to listen to whatever it is.
[44:01.530 --> 44:02.910]  Should we play it in this episode?
[44:03.550 --> 44:05.390]  Yeah, can we insert it?
[44:05.490 --> 44:06.170]  Yeah, Eric, just go ahead.
[44:06.290 --> 44:07.590]  Eric, Nick, could you just cut it in here?
[44:07.730 --> 44:09.050]  We just plop it in right now.
[44:14.490 --> 44:21.070]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and I would love to invite you to listen to our fun podcast.
[44:21.410 --> 44:22.690]  It's called F*** Face.
[44:23.090 --> 44:24.830]  And it's about, well, it's about those two things.
[44:24.830 --> 44:29.410]  It's about, we cover faces, we talk about who's got a good face, who's got a bad face.
[44:29.510 --> 44:30.450]  Do you want to f*** it?
[44:30.770 --> 44:31.410]  We do.
[44:31.470 --> 44:32.290]  This is not usable.
[44:32.610 --> 44:32.710]  What?
[44:32.770 --> 44:33.890]  This is not usable.
[44:33.910 --> 44:34.650]  Of course it's usable.
[44:34.790 --> 44:35.050]  What do you mean?
[44:35.370 --> 44:37.170]  Yeah, this is the most professional show ever.
[44:38.010 --> 44:39.370]  We can't say any of it.
[44:39.390 --> 44:42.910]  And then the audience is wondering why it was bleeped the first time and not bleeped the second time.
[44:46.550 --> 44:49.510]  Tune in every week for a new episode.
[44:50.310 --> 44:52.290]  You'll like it, and so will your mom.
[44:52.590 --> 44:52.830]  What?
[44:52.990 --> 44:54.070]  Tell her to bring her face.
[44:54.070 --> 44:54.790]  What?
[44:55.590 --> 44:55.990]  What?
[44:56.170 --> 44:56.490]  No!
[45:09.840 --> 45:19.380]  And then coming out of it, it made me go back and listen to our first commercial, which I don't remember if we recorded one episode first and then recorded our commercial or if we recorded the commercial first.
[45:19.800 --> 45:20.320]  I don't remember that.
[45:20.480 --> 45:20.640]  We did one.
[45:21.100 --> 45:22.040]  Yeah, we absolutely did.
[45:22.060 --> 45:24.360]  It was one of the first recordings we ever did.
[45:24.720 --> 45:32.440]  It's funny because we didn't know what the show was going to be at that point, but we made a commercial for a thing that we just didn't really know what it would be.
[45:32.440 --> 45:38.260]  And I'm surprised by how much thematically you could see, like, where things would go.
[45:38.740 --> 45:40.740]  And in some ways, it's a very similar commercial.
[45:41.080 --> 45:44.460]  It's Eric saying that what we've recorded is completely useless.
[45:45.100 --> 45:46.500]  That's the same thing in both things.
[45:46.580 --> 45:51.380]  It's a terrible read, but it's just interesting to go back and listen to our first commercial.
[45:52.140 --> 45:58.300]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and I am the co-host of the new Rooster Teeth podcast, F*** This, here with Andrew Panton and Gavin Frey.
[45:58.420 --> 45:58.640]  Hello.
[45:58.960 --> 46:00.160]  Andrew, what's a f*** this?
[46:00.160 --> 46:06.540]  A f*** this is an event that happens that makes you look like an idiot, and the only way to deal with it is by laughing.
[46:06.660 --> 46:07.720]  And that's the podcast.
[46:09.620 --> 46:11.120]  Do you think you have anything in there?
[46:11.400 --> 46:11.800]  No!
[46:16.680 --> 46:20.420]  This is it. This is the trailer. You're an idiot. This is it.
[46:20.660 --> 46:23.440]  This is the trailer. F*** this. Like and subscribe.
[46:24.160 --> 46:28.740]  Now, in that commercial, did we insinuate we were going to f*** anybody's mom in the face?
[46:29.080 --> 46:29.260]  No.
[46:29.260 --> 46:34.680]  Not even. We didn't get close to that, but it was equally unusable, in Eric's opinion.
[46:34.700 --> 46:36.240]  What part was Eric pissed about the first one?
[46:36.860 --> 46:42.780]  Uh, just that we didn't really explain anything. We didn't give any indication of what the show would be at all.
[46:42.860 --> 46:50.600]  We just kind of talked for like 10 seconds, and then was, you were, Geoff, in sort of a dejected way, was like, is any of that usable?
[46:50.760 --> 46:53.780]  And Eric says, no, absolutely not. And then that's just the commercial.
[46:55.080 --> 46:58.240]  I think we just still don't know what this, how to describe this thing.
[46:58.940 --> 47:00.880]  I don't know how the f*** I'm supposed to, yeah.
[47:02.120 --> 47:03.980]  Even the stuff we say doesn't mean anything.
[47:04.400 --> 47:09.600]  Like, have you ever told somebody like, oh, what's your podcast about? And you go, well, technically it's deep lore about nothing.
[47:09.900 --> 47:13.400]  And they go, what does that mean? And you go, I don't know. I honestly don't know.
[47:13.760 --> 47:19.360]  I always get defensive when people are like, what's it about? And I'm just like thinking in my head, and I'm like, I don't know, what do you want from me?
[47:19.600 --> 47:21.240]  Yeah, what are you about? F*** off.
[47:22.780 --> 47:29.640]  I will say I've tried to describe what the show is multiple times. I've never said that it's about f***ing mom's faces.
[47:30.020 --> 47:32.260]  I don't think anybody specifically said that.
[47:32.700 --> 47:34.820]  I feel you heavily implied it.
[47:35.180 --> 47:38.680]  If that's what you took from it, sure.
[47:39.080 --> 47:43.020]  Have we ever reviewed a face before? Has that ever been a thing that we've done?
[47:43.560 --> 47:47.920]  Like, even as like an aside, obviously that's never been a bit we did, but have we ever commented?
[47:48.400 --> 47:50.380]  Isn't that a Mark Zuckerberg thing?
[47:50.380 --> 47:50.960]  Is it?
[47:51.180 --> 47:52.440]  Isn't that why he started Facebook?
[47:52.860 --> 47:54.420]  Is that? I don't know. I have no idea.
[47:54.920 --> 47:57.000]  You said that like you had more to expand on.
[47:57.140 --> 47:57.960]  Yeah, I'm waiting to hear.
[47:58.340 --> 48:01.840]  I thought it was like he was rating how hot the women at that college were.
[48:02.260 --> 48:04.320]  Is that specifically related to faces?
[48:05.120 --> 48:09.980]  Oh, I don't know. I saw the social network once. Isn't that what they were doing? I don't remember the movie very well.
[48:10.700 --> 48:14.000]  I don't remember them reviewing faces in the social network.
[48:14.420 --> 48:14.840]  Oh, s***.
[48:15.720 --> 48:16.900]  Why is it called Facebook then?
[48:21.040 --> 48:30.900]  Maybe that's what it was used for, but I've never heard anyone open with such confidence that they were an expert on the subject to have nothing else to contribute after that statement.
[48:31.000 --> 48:32.940]  Tell me more about Leona Wandel or whatever.
[48:34.420 --> 48:35.720]  She makes baskets.
[48:36.060 --> 48:36.360]  Okay.
[48:36.740 --> 48:40.580]  Yeah. She's the wicker basket queen. She's the head of the baskets.
[48:41.120 --> 48:41.240]  Interesting.
[48:41.240 --> 48:47.040]  What is a Facebook before a Facebook? This is from Britannica.com.
[48:47.140 --> 48:55.020]  It began at Harvard University in 2003 as FaceMash, an online service for students to judge the attractiveness of their fellow students.
[48:55.340 --> 48:57.260]  So Facebook started as hot or not?
[48:58.000 --> 48:58.180]  Yeah.
[48:58.960 --> 48:59.620]  I had no idea.
[49:00.080 --> 49:05.440]  I feel like even though Gavin's sort of right, describing it as evaluating faces is odd.
[49:06.020 --> 49:07.240]  It's like a strangely specific...
[49:08.140 --> 49:09.520]  Well, it's a very Gavin thing.
[49:09.740 --> 49:10.160]  It is.
[49:10.160 --> 49:10.720]  Let's be honest.
[49:11.060 --> 49:14.020]  This is on par with the weird Gavin that we've dealt with in this episode.
[49:14.820 --> 49:17.240]  Let's see if Footbook.com is registered.
[49:18.320 --> 49:21.200]  The old nigger had the same joke at the same time. Feetbook.
[49:23.280 --> 49:23.760]  Gross.
[49:24.360 --> 49:29.300]  I don't know if this is worth expanding on at all, Geoff, but have you had any dental updates?
[49:29.400 --> 49:31.220]  Because that's also a thing we left off on.
[49:31.960 --> 49:32.680]  On Monday.
[49:33.220 --> 49:33.700]  Yeah.
[49:34.360 --> 49:36.600]  So I went to the...
[49:36.600 --> 49:39.660]  Okay. So I saw you guys. We did office day on Friday.
[49:39.660 --> 49:40.420]  Yeah.
[49:41.160 --> 49:43.180]  I was fine. I was pretty fine. I'm doing okay.
[49:43.680 --> 49:47.840]  Then Saturday, Emily and I went...
[49:47.840 --> 49:49.460]  I had an interesting experience.
[49:50.100 --> 49:54.560]  Emily told me she wanted to go spend the day in Waco.
[49:55.560 --> 50:02.280]  Now, I don't think I've been to Waco, Texas since I was in the Army when I was maybe 19 or 18.
[50:02.280 --> 50:06.280]  It's actually one of the first times I was actually...
[50:06.940 --> 50:12.120]  It's probably the only time in my life I was propositioned for sex for money.
[50:12.640 --> 50:16.560]  Somebody offered me money to have sex with them at a Denny's.
[50:17.080 --> 50:21.340]  I've probably told that story a million times in RT podcasts and stuff.
[50:21.780 --> 50:27.000]  It was very flattering, and the guy was actually quite a hunk.
[50:27.340 --> 50:28.980]  I felt pretty good about myself that day.
[50:29.480 --> 50:31.160]  Anyway, but not a fan of Waco.
[50:31.160 --> 50:32.880]  Waco's just kind of like, it's a college town.
[50:33.320 --> 50:35.220]  Baylor, it's like a Christian college.
[50:35.700 --> 50:42.000]  It's pretty boring, milquetoast, kind of like not so exciting, fucking middle-of-nowhere Texas college town, right?
[50:42.680 --> 50:45.500]  No need to go to Waco because we have San Marcos right down the road.
[50:46.580 --> 50:48.300]  But I hadn't been there in like 25 years.
[50:48.740 --> 50:50.740]  So, HGTV became a thing.
[50:50.960 --> 50:52.120]  It's like a huge thing, obviously.
[50:52.300 --> 50:55.720]  Everybody watches The Home, The Flipping Shows, and all that stuff, myself included.
[50:56.400 --> 51:03.740]  The Chip and Joanna Games, I've never seen their show, but I know of them because I see their magazines in the grocery store,
[51:03.940 --> 51:08.400]  and I see their commercials all the time, and they have like Magnolia or whatever the fuck it is.
[51:08.660 --> 51:13.740]  I didn't know that half of Waco, Texas is dedicated to them.
[51:14.420 --> 51:21.240]  They have like a compound downtown in Waco, Texas that's like HGTV Disney World.
[51:21.240 --> 51:28.100]  Like, you walk in and there's like a grain silo where you can buy sheets and bedding, and there's a purse store,
[51:28.360 --> 51:35.320]  and there's like a store where you can buy hats, and there's like a little mini baseball field for the kids to play,
[51:35.560 --> 51:38.240]  and they have a big cupcake shop.
[51:38.360 --> 51:40.400]  Look, Nick knows all about it, the silos.
[51:40.700 --> 51:41.880]  They have a big cupcake shop.
[51:41.900 --> 51:44.180]  They have like tons of stuff everywhere.
[51:44.180 --> 51:56.320]  It's like seven West Elms and a CB2 and like four pottery barns all together in one big campus.
[51:57.260 --> 52:04.340]  And just with like 500,000 35-year-old white women.
[52:04.520 --> 52:07.640]  I almost lost Emily 86 times.
[52:07.880 --> 52:12.540]  I actually told her, I was like, God forbid if Emily ever dies early.
[52:12.540 --> 52:14.800]  I'm never gonna, I'm done with love after her.
[52:14.940 --> 52:17.660]  I'm not gonna try to find another person to fall in love with.
[52:17.700 --> 52:19.060]  I'm not gonna move on.
[52:19.840 --> 52:21.360]  Emily's my last shot at love.
[52:21.580 --> 52:23.740]  So if she were to die tomorrow, it'd be the worst.
[52:24.340 --> 52:27.740]  But if that were to happen, I think I would start going to Waco,
[52:28.220 --> 52:35.380]  and I think I would just sit at the Magnolia compound on a park bench and just watch women from behind
[52:35.380 --> 52:37.120]  because it's almost like she's there.
[52:37.560 --> 52:38.920]  It's the wildest thing.
[52:38.920 --> 52:44.580]  It's just like a thousand blonde ladies all wearing the exact same clothes as my fiance.
[52:45.460 --> 52:47.320]  From behind, it's just like, oh shit, there's Emily.
[52:47.420 --> 52:48.020]  Nope, there's Emily.
[52:48.140 --> 52:48.940]  It's insane.
[52:49.100 --> 52:50.240]  We were laughing about it all day.
[52:50.480 --> 52:51.780]  There's gotta be better phrasing.
[52:52.660 --> 52:54.680]  That was the worst phrasing.
[52:55.300 --> 52:55.800]  How do you mean?
[52:57.080 --> 52:59.500]  Just watch women from behind.
[52:59.640 --> 53:00.360]  Oh, I see.
[53:00.680 --> 53:03.060]  No, I just like from the front, I can tell that it's not my fiance.
[53:03.220 --> 53:05.640]  But if you just like see somebody in your peripheral vision,
[53:06.220 --> 53:10.660]  somebody who's the relative height and size of Meg with red hair, you'd go, oh, that's not Meg.
[53:10.820 --> 53:13.020]  Maybe you just need to go and squint at women.
[53:13.920 --> 53:17.540]  For a second, you're like, oh, you know, I'm near that person.
[53:17.640 --> 53:20.240]  It gives you like a little dopamine hit of like, oh, they're still with me in this world.
[53:20.400 --> 53:22.760]  Yeah, I was with you, and it's just so sad.
[53:23.000 --> 53:24.680]  I think it's sad too. I hope it never happens.
[53:25.700 --> 53:27.460]  It would be really, really sad if it did.
[53:27.980 --> 53:31.800]  Anyway, so that place is fucking weird and bizarre, and I wasn't a fan.
[53:32.260 --> 53:33.900]  But while I was there, my tooth started hurting.
[53:35.300 --> 53:40.960]  And by the end of the day, it was hurting so goddamn badly that I was Googling.
[53:41.340 --> 53:43.340]  Yeah, so I was Googling, just out of the blue, it just started.
[53:44.640 --> 53:48.700]  I was Googling like 24-hour emergency dentist again, and I couldn't find anything.
[53:48.960 --> 53:53.860]  And then I found one. I got an appointment first thing Sunday morning at a dentist across town.
[53:54.260 --> 53:58.300]  Saturday night, I had some painkillers left over from my gum stuff.
[53:58.460 --> 54:00.100]  So I took a painkiller, it calmed down, I went to bed.
[54:00.280 --> 54:03.620]  I woke up in the morning, no pain. Totally gone.
[54:04.200 --> 54:05.060]  Like, what the fuck?
[54:05.440 --> 54:09.620]  I went to the dentist anyway, because I'm like, I can't fuck around with this anymore. It's killing me, right?
[54:10.120 --> 54:11.580]  It's pain, no pain, pain, no pain.
[54:11.820 --> 54:15.240]  They'd look at x-rays, they're like, I don't think you need a root canal.
[54:15.820 --> 54:18.000]  And you're not in any pain, right? And I'm like, I'm not in any pain.
[54:18.100 --> 54:20.940]  And they're like, yeah, it's just... it looks fine.
[54:21.200 --> 54:24.140]  They were like, you should just go back to your dentist tomorrow and see what they say.
[54:24.460 --> 54:26.500]  So I'm like, fuck, okay, I guess.
[54:26.880 --> 54:30.480]  So I get up the next day and I go to my dentist, and we have a long conversation about it.
[54:30.480 --> 54:37.140]  And she retests the tooth 20 different times, and there's really not pain in the way that they think there should be for me to get a root canal.
[54:37.480 --> 54:40.480]  Now, I realize I'm on painkillers, so that might be part of it.
[54:40.900 --> 54:44.400]  And she was like, let's go another week and just see what happens.
[54:44.840 --> 54:50.880]  One thing she did do was she ground the tooth, the temp down, so that it's maybe not like...
[54:50.880 --> 54:55.800]  She was afraid that maybe it was a little larger than it should be, and maybe it was causing extra pressure when I chew or something.
[54:57.760 --> 55:03.240]  Anyway, the sum total of all that meant that by the end of that day, I was ready to kill myself again from pain.
[55:04.240 --> 55:09.560]  I took a pain pill, and I was gonna get up the next morning and call her and go, hey, I need to come in and get this fucking root canal because it's brutal.
[55:09.980 --> 55:13.940]  And there was no pain the next day, and there really hasn't been any pain since.
[55:14.240 --> 55:16.460]  And so there have been... it's like a one or a two.
[55:16.740 --> 55:18.980]  I've taken like Advil a few times here or there.
[55:19.320 --> 55:20.940]  I have an appointment to go back next Monday.
[55:20.940 --> 55:26.840]  I'm assuming this Saturday I'll be in intense pain because it only surfaces on Saturdays, apparently.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.040]  When I'm the furthest away from the dentist.
[55:31.460 --> 55:33.080]  It's like when it likes to kick in.
[55:33.880 --> 55:37.200]  It likes to maximize the misery it can cause me.
[55:38.040 --> 55:42.200]  But yeah, I gotta go check in next Monday, and I think I'm just gonna tell her, let's do the root canal.
[55:42.560 --> 55:43.660]  Let's just fucking do it.
[55:43.960 --> 55:45.760]  Just get it over with.
[55:45.760 --> 55:47.460]  Just get past this.
[55:47.800 --> 55:49.840]  Because this has now been like a three week ordeal.
[55:50.160 --> 55:53.680]  And it's just like, every day I wake up with pain roulette.
[55:53.900 --> 55:57.300]  I hate this so much because we can't help you.
[55:57.900 --> 55:59.180]  No, there's nothing we can do.
[55:59.260 --> 56:01.660]  I just feel so helpless every time this happens to you.
[56:02.060 --> 56:08.640]  I feel pretty helpless too because I've made mouth care a big focus of my life for the past few years.
[56:08.780 --> 56:09.580]  And this podcast.
[56:09.580 --> 56:13.400]  And I'm really doing everything I can.
[56:13.420 --> 56:16.920]  I'm trying not to get down in the dumps about it.
[56:17.920 --> 56:20.800]  I'm trying to have a good year in 2023 and be positive.
[56:21.040 --> 56:22.840]  But it's getting difficult.
[56:24.020 --> 56:26.380]  I'm really struggling with this one fucking tooth.
[56:26.980 --> 56:30.580]  Is this the last root? How many root canals have you had on this tooth already?
[56:31.300 --> 56:31.500]  Zero.
[56:31.500 --> 56:32.340]  This was just a crown.
[56:32.820 --> 56:34.200]  I've never had a root canal on this tooth.
[56:35.520 --> 56:37.640]  I've had so many root canals, I thought it was one.
[56:37.780 --> 56:40.720]  But they were like, no, it's one of the rare ones that doesn't.
[56:41.920 --> 56:42.900]  This is terrible.
[56:43.340 --> 56:51.140]  But you know how in Survivor, and it's not so much the recent seasons, but they used to do that game where everyone would have three sandbags.
[56:51.300 --> 56:54.280]  And if you got the question right, you could chop down somebody's sandbag.
[56:54.640 --> 56:56.620]  And then whoever's the last one standing won.
[56:57.340 --> 56:59.180]  I could see that with your tooth.
[56:59.640 --> 57:02.180]  Because you can have three root canals per tooth, right?
[57:02.180 --> 57:08.520]  If we could just have a visual of what each tooth is on as far as how many root canals it has left in it.
[57:09.160 --> 57:10.940]  There's gotta be a lot of ones.
[57:11.420 --> 57:14.060]  It's like Mario Kart Battle Mode with the balloons.
[57:14.720 --> 57:15.740]  Exactly, yeah.
[57:16.400 --> 57:20.680]  It's that. I would love to see a per tooth, like how many you got in each one.
[57:20.860 --> 57:21.500]  Oh, man.
[57:22.480 --> 57:26.120]  Oh, speaking of... not to change the subject, but Survivor starts soon.
[57:26.620 --> 57:26.920]  I'm very excited.
[57:26.920 --> 57:27.840]  It does, yeah, next week.
[57:27.840 --> 57:32.540]  I read an article recently. Well, Emily read it and showed it to me.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.060]  From a woman who was on Survivor many, many years ago.
[57:36.620 --> 57:40.020]  And they were asking what things don't they tell you about Survivor?
[57:40.180 --> 57:45.800]  And in that article she said that every single person on Survivor has diarrhea the entire time.
[57:47.160 --> 57:51.040]  Like the entire show, constant violent diarrhea.
[57:51.560 --> 57:55.080]  And also, every dude has jock itch the entire time.
[57:55.180 --> 57:56.820]  Just brutal, painful jock itch.
[57:57.960 --> 57:58.880]  It's horrendous.
[57:59.720 --> 58:03.080]  They don't cover that on TV, but apparently it's a fucking nightmare.
[58:03.760 --> 58:06.800]  And then I think it becomes worse the different environments they filmed in.
[58:07.060 --> 58:09.340]  They all film in Fiji now, I think.
[58:09.480 --> 58:13.600]  But when they're in Brazil, I think rashes were especially bad.
[58:14.060 --> 58:15.480]  They don't really cover that, as you said.
[58:15.700 --> 58:21.200]  But the difference between fresh water and ocean water, as far as being able to clean and whatnot, just nightmare.
[58:23.700 --> 58:26.780]  This is something that made me think, do you guys have anything like this?
[58:27.140 --> 58:31.360]  I was getting a little haircut the other day, and the guy finished up by wiping...
[58:32.140 --> 58:32.400]  What?
[58:34.740 --> 58:35.140]  What?
[58:35.580 --> 58:36.440]  What are you laughing at?
[58:37.220 --> 58:37.980]  Nobody's saying anything.
[58:38.560 --> 58:40.520]  I thought someone...
[58:40.520 --> 58:42.740]  The guy finished off by wiping up.
[58:45.060 --> 58:49.560]  He's right, I did laugh, because when you said haircut, my brain immediately went...
[58:49.560 --> 58:53.940]  Life hack, if you want your hair shorter, go to a barber or a hairstylist.
[58:54.100 --> 58:57.620]  I just had that. That was a little moment to myself that I didn't intend.
[58:58.080 --> 58:59.600]  Here's a tip, hair grows.
[59:01.260 --> 59:05.180]  Sorry Gavin, I didn't mean for that to pick up a mic.
[59:06.640 --> 59:08.140]  That was like me on Call of Duty.
[59:11.100 --> 59:11.940]  He wiped...
[59:12.370 --> 59:13.740]  Did we lose Gavin?
[59:14.700 --> 59:15.120]  Yeah.
[59:16.320 --> 59:19.160]  He wiped him down, and Gavin was never seen again.
[59:21.060 --> 59:22.860]  Gavin? I think he's gone.
[59:23.540 --> 59:24.520]  Can you not hear me?
[59:25.020 --> 59:26.000]  Now he's back.
[59:26.360 --> 59:28.320]  So you got wiped down.
[59:28.820 --> 59:31.000]  Some guy finished off on you and then wiped you down.
[59:31.160 --> 59:31.860]  I don't like this.
[59:32.300 --> 59:34.740]  It's my internet shit, why is it cut out?
[59:34.900 --> 59:35.800]  You're good now.
[59:36.460 --> 59:38.760]  I can hear you fine, it's just cut out.
[59:38.980 --> 59:41.060]  You said wiped down, and then we lost it.
[59:41.060 --> 59:42.360]  So you got wiped down.
[59:43.080 --> 59:44.400]  No, I didn't get wiped down.
[59:44.980 --> 59:45.800]  He finished you off.
[59:46.660 --> 59:49.680]  He wiped some beard oil in, and I thought, that smells lovely.
[59:50.720 --> 59:51.660]  Do you sell that?
[59:51.720 --> 59:55.820]  And he said, yeah, here's a big old pot of this stuff with a little squeezy top.
[59:56.200 --> 01:00:00.940]  And he said, you've got to squeeze in maybe a quarter of a pump.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.560]  You don't even need to press it all the way down.
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.800]  Just a little tiny grain of rice amount.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.920]  Rub it on your hands, rub it in.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.340]  And I was like, look at the size of this bottle.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:12.420]  And he said, yeah, that'll probably last you until the rest of your life.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.260]  And I just thought, that's a morbid item to have.
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:21.780]  Like, I now own the last beard oil I ever need to buy from now until the end of my life.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:25.500]  And I was wondering if either of you guys have already bought the final something.
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:30.200]  There's a very good chance I bought the last fridge I'll ever own.
[01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:40.890]  There's just something worrying about the fact that, like, I either die or I lose it.
[01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:42.730]  And that's the reason I buy more of that stuff.
[01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:48.610]  I'm now going to have to feel the pressure to keep that item wherever I go for the rest of time.
[01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:53.950]  I see what you're saying, but I feel like it's odd to have that tag when your toilet paper roll looks like this.
[01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:57.070]  When you have enough toilet paper to last you seven years.
[01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:00.370]  Gavin posted a photo of his bathroom recently.
[01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:02.490]  It's the worst toilet paper roll I've ever seen.
[01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:04.690]  I don't have an issue with the amount of paper.
[01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:06.270]  You live your life, do what you want to.
[01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:08.070]  It's in such a shitty spot.
[01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:09.190]  It sucks.
[01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:11.630]  I feel like it'll get knocked over.
[01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:16.030]  And what's the difference in your mind between that purchase and is it just the longevity?
[01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:20.370]  Because you will have to buy another toilet paper roll, but that's long down the road, I assume.
[01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:22.310]  I cut out again, what did you say?
[01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:26.470]  I was making fun of your toilet paper roll.
[01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:29.170]  How long does your toilet paper last you?
[01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:31.450]  That lasts me a month. Each roll is a month.
[01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:32.690]  One month.
[01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.010]  I bet that's not even a week for me.
[01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:38.510]  Can we test that?
[01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:41.310]  Can we see how quickly you can get through that, Geoff?
[01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:43.790]  Shall I give you one and we'll both just use only that?
[01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.750]  Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
[01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:47.030]  Let me ask you a question, how many shits a day do you take?
[01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:49.430]  Between one and two.
[01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:52.090]  Okay, I'm at four so far today.
[01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:53.310]  I'm gonna destroy you.
[01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:54.370]  Oh my god.
[01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:56.970]  I'm gonna destroy you like I destroy toilets.
[01:01:56.970 --> 01:02:09.010]  It lasts me a month, but also because it's so big, it doesn't dwindle very fast because there's so much surface area around the large part.
[01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:13.150]  So it looks like that for a really long time and then it suddenly disappears.
[01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.670]  Interesting.
[01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:15.230]  Yeah, that's how stuff works.
[01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:18.810]  When you use it, it gets smaller eventually.
[01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:26.870]  It's not linear in terms of, like, every time you pull five off, it doesn't really affect the shape of a giant one as opposed to when you pull five off a narrow one.
[01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:30.010]  I mean, it does affect it, it's just less noticeable.
[01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:34.610]  I do think that we should do this.
[01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:41.930]  So if you'll deliver me one, can you ensure that Meg doesn't shit with that paper for the next month and I'll ensure that Emily doesn't shit with mine?
[01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.650]  Yeah.
[01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:45.210]  I don't want any outside influences.
[01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:48.230]  What did you hate about it, Andrew? Just that it's on a tiny little stand?
[01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:53.030]  That it's on a tiny little stand. The stand to paper ratio is way off.
[01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:57.450]  And also it's right next to the shower in a way that I feel like is just going to get damp.
[01:02:57.550 --> 01:03:01.830]  And I don't want eight feet of damp toilet paper. It's a disaster.
[01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:08.170]  It's a big risk. You're putting yourself at risk unnecessarily with that placement of the toilet paper.
[01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:09.290]  Well, there's glass in the way.
[01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:13.210]  That's fair. You get out, I don't know, water goes everywhere.
[01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:19.850]  You're on me about bathroom stuff. It spreads everywhere. Everything goes everywhere.
[01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:23.130]  And then when it comes to your water situation, you're like, I control every droplet.
[01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:25.450]  You're not. You're getting water on that paper.
[01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:28.810]  Dude, I think that's an incredibly fair criticism of Andrew.
[01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:32.710]  I think it's absolutely fair. I'm doubling down on myself.
[01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:35.790]  What were you going to say, Geoff?
[01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:38.310]  Is this the bathroom? Are you using a bidet in this bathroom?
[01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:43.370]  No, this is my office one. So this is like, my office is the guest bedroom.
[01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:46.190]  So that's just the en suite.
[01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:51.030]  So I'm just going to take all of my poos in there then.
[01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:57.590]  Okay, you're going to be pooping without a bidet for a month. That seems rough.
[01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:03.710]  I mean, it's either that or I have to get a second one in the master bedroom.
[01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:08.270]  And we'll have his and hers giant bog rolls.
[01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:19.210]  Well, it's just like it throws the competition off if I'm using a bidet and you're not.
[01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:22.670]  And I'm not going to take the month off of using a bidet.
[01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:26.670]  Okay, that's fair. I mean, you already had to take off a week.
[01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:30.430]  That's true. It was a long cold week.
[01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:32.630]  And do you want to come and get this or do you want me to mail it to you?
[01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:37.810]  I'll definitely come get it. You don't need to mail it to me or bring it over Sunday.
[01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.990]  Okay.
[01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:45.030]  Nick is being Eric about it and telling us we should start wrapping up.
[01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:48.010]  But I do have one more thing to talk about if y'all...
[01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:49.050]  I'd love to hear it.
[01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:49.570]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:52.670]  Don't mind. So I'm working on the cookbook, right?
[01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:56.030]  As a matter of fact, I don't know when this airs. I think we're three or four episodes ahead right now.
[01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:58.470]  Not recording next week. I'm bummed about that.
[01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:07.510]  But anyway, so I don't know. The cookbook may have already been turned in at this point in real time when this airs.
[01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:12.010]  But I'm pretty close on it. I still need a recipe for some minor things.
[01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:17.130]  Gavin turned in a phenomenal recipe for his cold cheese sandwich. I really appreciate it.
[01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:20.970]  I do still need a Plowman's pizza and a Popolza recipe.
[01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:23.410]  And if I could get those two things from you, I'd be pretty set.
[01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:25.290]  I can make everything else work.
[01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:29.570]  I also think I could go back and watch those episodes or listen to them and make it myself.
[01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:31.990]  But it sure would be easier if I didn't have to do that.
[01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:36.890]  And I also think you guys... I want to be true to your recipes.
[01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:41.690]  Anyway, point being, I feel like maybe the book is missing one thing.
[01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:43.690]  And I was talking about this with Andrew.
[01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:50.930]  And we came upon the idea of what if we built the perfect ultimate recipe?
[01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:53.290]  And the way we do this is...
[01:05:53.810 --> 01:05:54.170]  God damn it.
[01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:55.970]  What the fuck was that?
[01:05:56.330 --> 01:05:58.790]  There's Gavin popping in and out of the Discord chat.
[01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.850]  What were you saying?
[01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:07.790]  So for the final recipe of the cookbook, what if we build together the ultimate recipe?
[01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:09.750]  And the way that we do that is...
[01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:12.870]  I will present a recipe, like one ingredient and what to do with it.
[01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:15.790]  And then Andrew builds on that ingredient.
[01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:17.710]  And then Gavin builds on that ingredient.
[01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:19.370]  And then Eric and then Nick.
[01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:20.850]  And maybe we all go through it twice.
[01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:22.810]  And then we see what we've built.
[01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:24.270]  I love the idea.
[01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:25.810]  Do we want to make like...
[01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:28.090]  I was thinking of what the structure would be.
[01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:30.510]  Could it be like a sandwich or like a salad?
[01:06:30.690 --> 01:06:32.990]  Or like what's something that we could add stuff to?
[01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:34.170]  That would make sense.
[01:06:34.310 --> 01:06:35.090]  Can I tell you why it hurts?
[01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:37.310]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:39.050]  What if we...
[01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:41.730]  10 seconds of silence.
[01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:43.310]  And then we'll see what we built.
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:49.400]  Alright.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.620]  There you go. You've listened to another episode.
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.760]  Just sum up real quick.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.640]  Is he out? Is he out on the recipe?
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.280]  I already summed it up twice!
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.480]  We build a recipe by committee, dickhead.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.400]  I go first, Andrew goes second.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.040]  I have an idea.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.860]  Gavin, call Geoff right now on your phone.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.180]  And then it's a direct communication.
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:11.920]  I don't have any signal.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.240]  I tried.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.540]  Move to the city.
[01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:23.660]  Okay, Geoff, you start writing an email right now.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.120]  Gavin, get ready to receive it.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.540]  Geoff, do a little summary that's like 10 seconds that we can cut.
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:30.640]  I want to build the ultimate recipe.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.460]  And I want to build it with you guys.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:35.340]  I think the book needs one more big fun thing.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.480]  And so I was thinking it could start with maybe...
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.660]  Andrew says, okay, you start with chicken and you boil it.
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:44.580]  And then Gavin says, okay, and the next thing you do is you add cheese.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.180]  This kind of cheese.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.300]  And then Nick adds an ingredient.
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.340]  And then Eric adds an ingredient.
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:50.020]  And then I add an ingredient and what to do with it.
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:54.900]  And then after maybe two rounds, we have something built that's a food.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:55.800]  Love it.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.620]  That's like the ultimate recipe.
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:58.380]  I'm all in on that.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.180]  I don't want to do it anymore.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.100]  After saying it three times, I no longer want to participate in it.
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.080]  But I will.
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:05.440]  You'll come back around.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.480]  Once you see the other ingredients, once it gets to your turn on the list, or maybe you even start.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.560]  I think you'll be back in.
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:16.020]  Obviously, I don't want to do it today because we don't have Eric.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.920]  But I think everybody should be involved.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:22.500]  But next time we record, which will be in two weeks, be thinking about what you want to build.
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:26.100]  I think it should be a main dish because we're a little light on main dishes.
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:26.880]  Okay.
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:28.180]  So...
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:28.660]  Interesting.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:29.480]  That's fascinating.
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:31.460]  Are there any ingredients that are banned?
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:33.020]  No.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:34.600]  Okay.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:35.380]  No, I don't think so.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.740]  I'm worried about Gavin in this recipe.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:38.720]  Nick's banning Piccadilly.
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:40.880]  Okay, Nick says no Piccadilly.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.600]  All right, all right, all right, all right.
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:44.900]  Maybe it's like Rainbow Six Siege.
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:46.780]  Maybe we each get to ban one food.
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:48.640]  Get to ban one ingredient.
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:49.760]  Oh, my God.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.100]  Can we just all gang up on Gavin?
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:53.240]  Outside of Nick?
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.720]  Well, you know which ingredients I main.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.240]  Yeah.
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.160]  I do.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:02.360]  I need to decide, though, if I want to counter the Branston or the Southern.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.160]  Gavin mains Branston.
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.420]  I main Branston, typically.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:14.680]  Geoff's back on board.
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:17.420]  You son of a bitch, I'm in.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.160]  Oh, my God.
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:20.240]  Why is that so funny?
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:23.780]  All right.
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:24.720]  Should we stop now?
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:25.840]  Yeah, we should stop.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:30.460]  I'm just going to brace for whatever Eric says about what happened this time when we talk to him next.
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.120]  But thankfully, that's in two weeks.
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:34.340]  He's a little trickster.
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:36.280]  He's a little untrustworthy trickster.
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:40.780]  So I wouldn't be surprised if he completely and totally backs you up just to throw it all into turmoil.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.060]  We'll find out.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:43.080]  Yeah.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:50.340]  Oh, Andrew, we need to record our episode of our XFL sports show.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.920]  Yeah, I don't know what that is.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:52.640]  And release them.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.620]  Like, do we have a release plan?
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:02.320]  Because it feels really weird if we release an entire season recap after the season is done.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.840]  Like, there's no point.
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.660]  Seems like a real f*** face thing to do, doesn't it?
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:11.280]  You made a topical podcast for the thing that's already happening and you have no release plan?
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:12.180]  Yes.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.760]  Yeah, that's what happened.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.000]  Yeah, as a test.
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:21.140]  I've spent a lot of time, Geoff, the last few days thinking, like, I don't know what this show is.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:21.620]  Same.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.300]  It can't be that.
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:24.780]  But it is that.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.480]  Maybe we go back to the drawing board.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.120]  Because, I'll be honest with you, Andrew.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:35.700]  I have been really distracted by tooth stuff.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:42.280]  Like, my mouth, my tooth is just, like, present enough to always be distracting to me.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:43.020]  You know what I mean?
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.280]  Like, I was talking about this with my therapist, Dan with Emily, this week.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:51.320]  I feel like I've got nothing done because I feel like I can't focus on anything other than, like, how annoyed I am about my tooth.
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:54.060]  And the fact that it's coming on Saturday?
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:59.560]  Yeah, I feel like the ex-, yeah, I'm two days away from misery, I guarantee you.
[01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:09.560]  But, yeah, so it's, like, it's fucking, it's thrown me off my game and I haven't been able to focus on getting our sports fan podcast out, unfortunately.
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:12.000]  Do you think Best of Faces is out at this point?
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.000]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:14.920]  I hope so.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:16.040]  It was fantastic.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.640]  Does it come out when the Office Day, when Sausage Talk comes out?
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.180]  Yeah, I think Sausage Talk comes out.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.600]  I don't know when that is, yeah.
[01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:24.460]  We should talk about that before we end.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.120]  So, we filmed the Office Day, we mentioned that.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.220]  What did we record in the Office Day?
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:31.760]  We should probably talk about those things just so people are aware they're coming.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.780]  Episode 2 of Sausage Talk.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:34.960]  It was definitely recorded.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:35.660]  It was a long one.
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:36.600]  I think it was a good one.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:43.900]  Eric was mad at me yesterday because we didn't talk about merch stuff that he wanted to talk about in Sausage Talk.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.980]  He's just mad.
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:48.060]  All the time now.
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.020]  You ever notice that?
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.040]  I have.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.040]  He's just angry.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.360]  He looked really mad today when I took a picture of him.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:53.800]  Do you want to see?
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:55.180]  Yeah, sure.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.580]  Oh, he looks... he... he...
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.860]  I don't know what it is with these little rooms.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.100]  He's angry.
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.740]  Like, Eric has an office, I assume.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.720]  But everyone's, like, tucked in these little cubes, which is fine for privacy.
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.400]  But why the massive window?
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:12.440]  It's so weird.
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:14.100]  I've never seen this.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:17.900]  It looked almost like an old painting, originally.
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.400]  Like, the way it's formatted.
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:20.600]  Just, like, grumpy man.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.340]  Oh, that's such a great idea.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.480]  I want to print a vinyl of me having a meeting.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.420]  And I want to put it on the inside of the window.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.440]  Yeah, he's upset.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.780]  What else did we do?
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:40.020]  Uh, we recorded a, uh... what is the name?
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.920]  I keep forgetting the name of all these shows because it's so stupid.
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:46.300]  We did a Does It Do spin-off thing.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:48.700]  Do We Do.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:49.800]  Do We Do.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:50.060]  Do We Do.
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:51.020]  We did Do We Do.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.820]  But that won't come out for a long time.
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:55.740]  No, that's gonna be held for a long time.
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:58.960]  That'll come out after the next season of Does It Do comes out.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:04.500]  I found a bunch of that scene on TV products, and I showed Geoff and Gavin and Eric the ads for them.
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:05.500]  And we decided...
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.660]  Does it...
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:07.140]  No.
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:08.180]  Do We Do.
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.520]  We decided Do We Do, which would then become a Does It Do.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:17.960]  Do We Do this for Does It Do was the premise of that, but you won't see that for a long time.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.840]  We recorded a secret audio thing for the ten Gerplers.
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:26.020]  The ten golden Gerplers for the draw bag.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.060]  We do that.
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.680]  Have we talked about what that is on air?
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:31.520]  There was some confusion about whether we have or not.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.640]  I don't think you mentioned it.
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:34.940]  Yeah, I think we've talked about it.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:37.820]  Just to be clear, we're making more Gerplers.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:45.860]  There has been a tremendous desire for more Gerplers amongst the community.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:48.680]  And also in my kitchen as well. I only have one Gerpler.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:49.580]  I just want more.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.660]  And so we're going to make another run of Gerplers, way more, because we want everybody to be able to get one that gets one.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.340]  And so I think we're going to make a couple thousand.
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:59.500]  And we're going to make half of them blue and half of them purple.
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:01.840]  And then it's going to be like a blind box.
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:03.080]  Green. Half of them green.
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:05.360]  I'm sorry, green. Green or purple. I'm a fucking idiot.
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:07.460]  Half of them green, half of them purple.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:12.020]  And then it's just kind of like a blind box. You don't know if you're going to get the green one or the purple one.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:18.340]  And then within that, there are going to be ten golden Gerplers.
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:21.740]  They're just like the green and the purple ones, but they're golden.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.360]  There will only be ten. They will be randomly inserted.
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:32.900]  So you have no idea of knowing ahead of time if you're getting the golden Gerpler or a green one or a purple one, which are going to be fabulous.
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:34.620]  You're going to be very happy with your green.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.820]  You're going to be just as happy with your purple as you would be with the golden Gerpler.
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:50.380]  The only difference with the golden Gerpler is it's going to have a USB drive in the bottom of it with a very special video that we recorded for you specifically.
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:59.880]  It's, I think, a great idea. I'm excited to see if the people that get those will release them or not or if they'll keep the audio slash video private.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:00.720]  Exactly.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:01.500]  Video as well.
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:02.820]  And that's the thing.
[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:10.900]  The video, audio, video, the little presentation that we created that we put on the ten flash drives that go in the ten golden Gerplers, it's, they're yours.
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:11.900]  It's up to you.
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:14.820]  If you want to share them with the world, we encourage you to do so.
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:21.420]  If you want to hoard it to your, like, keep it to yourself like Martin Shkreli did with the Wu-Tang, you can do that as well.
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:28.720]  If you want to get your Gerpler seized by the FBI like Martin Shkreli, that is your business and we will not interfere.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.920]  We need to wrap this up because I'm getting sick of looking at Eric.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.880]  He looks like he's in a giant Polaroid and it's upsetting to me.
[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.380]  It just looks like a Polaroid to me.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:40.320]  It's like he's yelling at us right now from the photo.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.140]  End this.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.220]  What are you doing?
[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:43.180]  Stop!
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:44.220]  Stop!
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:44.720]  End!
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.460]  Alright, let's end.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:47.380]  Alright.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:49.120]  Hey, we'll see you next time.
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:55.960]  We sure do love you and we love that you listen to this podcast and then watch all the extra content that we make.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:02.100]  If you wouldn't mind, let a friend know, tell a friend, fuck a friend as we say.
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:05.500]  No, we don't. We've never said that.
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:09.940]  It's like, not like have sex with a friend, but like fuck a friend by telling them about the face.
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:12.260]  And then they're like, oh, I'm a fucker too now.
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:12.520]  No.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:13.460]  Fuck a face, yeah.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:21.600]  Anyway, there's 8 billion people on Earth, somewhere between 7 and a half and 8 billion people on Earth and most of them haven't heard fuck a face yet.
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:22.980]  And that seems unfair.
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:24.940]  Why didn't my internet cut out for that bit?
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:27.100]  I wish. I wish mine did.
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:29.280]  We'll see you next week.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.560]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
