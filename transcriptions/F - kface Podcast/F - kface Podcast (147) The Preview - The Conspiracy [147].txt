[00:14.620 --> 00:18.200]  Coming up on today's episode of F*** Face.
[00:18.760 --> 00:24.360]  So then it hit me. I can probably rewind the inside camera to where it went dead.
[00:24.580 --> 00:31.500]  So I jumped over and I did that and like three minutes before it blinks out, there were the cops inside the bar.
[00:32.080 --> 00:34.140]  We're on to something. Conspiracy. Conspiracy.
[00:34.620 --> 00:37.700]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:37.700 --> 00:43.820]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[00:44.380 --> 00:48.940]  My best buddies. What episode are we recording today? Is it a...
[00:49.660 --> 00:51.820]  It's a great question. Typically it's at the bottom.
[00:51.820 --> 00:54.660]  What do we got, Nick? 147.
[00:55.420 --> 00:58.620]  Oh, what are we doing for 150? That's a milestone.
[00:59.280 --> 00:59.680]  Is it?
[01:00.200 --> 01:03.500]  I would have guessed we were somewhere in the 160s. I had no idea.
[01:04.480 --> 01:06.520]  Do people celebrate the 150th?
[01:07.740 --> 01:08.260]  Uh...
[01:08.260 --> 01:09.600]  I don't think for shows they do, do they?
[01:10.300 --> 01:10.680]  Nah.
[01:11.120 --> 01:12.280]  Like anniversary maybe?
[01:12.840 --> 01:13.840]  Do you want to half celebrate?
[01:14.380 --> 01:16.460]  We should do 150 of something.
[01:17.520 --> 01:19.680]  150 of something? What would be 100...
[01:19.680 --> 01:23.380]  Andrew needs to eat 150 chia seeds.
[01:23.880 --> 01:26.920]  I could do that. I don't know if I want to do that.
[01:27.220 --> 01:28.080]  Individually bought.
[01:28.960 --> 01:32.700]  I got the chia seed. What's the difference between that and a chia pet?
[01:32.700 --> 01:38.620]  What is the association? Is a chia a general term? Is it the same thing?
[01:39.100 --> 01:42.840]  I think the seed is on the inside of the chia pet.
[01:43.660 --> 01:45.740]  And when you water it, chia grows.
[01:46.260 --> 01:51.840]  I thought you had to make a paste and then apply it to the thing and then apply water.
[01:51.960 --> 01:52.480]  Chia paste?
[01:52.480 --> 01:53.400]  I don't think it's on the inside.
[01:53.720 --> 01:58.120]  I don't know, man. I've never had a chia pet. So I wouldn't know.
[01:58.520 --> 01:58.860]  Really?
[01:59.560 --> 02:00.280]  No. Have you?
[02:01.460 --> 02:05.240]  Yeah, I did. But I never used it. But I definitely received one.
[02:05.340 --> 02:06.720]  You used it. What are you going to do with it?
[02:07.360 --> 02:09.780]  I think you're supposed to put paste on it and then water it.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.320]  Oh, and then you harvest?
[02:12.240 --> 02:18.700]  Well, it becomes funny, right? Like it'll be a little face and then you plant the chia and then it'll grow hair.
[02:19.140 --> 02:19.360]  Yeah.
[02:19.480 --> 02:23.400]  And then you can cut the hair and it'll be like... I guess you could eat it or throw it away or I don't know what the fuck you do.
[02:23.400 --> 02:26.400]  You can eat it? I didn't know you could eat it. I don't think you can eat it.
[02:26.560 --> 02:27.120]  Can you eat it?
[02:27.380 --> 02:28.460]  You can eat chia seeds.
[02:29.140 --> 02:30.120]  Yeah, I guess.
[02:30.120 --> 02:32.140]  Why wouldn't you be able to eat what's inside the seed?
[02:32.400 --> 02:34.100]  I just don't want to eat...
[02:34.100 --> 02:35.460]  Well, I mean, you wouldn't eat a sunflower.
[02:36.240 --> 02:38.380]  That's true. That's a great point.
[02:39.740 --> 02:44.280]  Although I think a sunflower is a delicious looking flower. You're going to eat a flower.
[02:44.440 --> 02:46.740]  What do chia seeds make?
[02:47.600 --> 02:52.300]  They have to... because I think you put the paste on and then it grows and I don't really want to eat like...
[02:53.260 --> 02:57.420]  Oh, what's the painter? The Afro. What's his name? Blanking his name.
[02:58.080 --> 02:58.800]  Bob Ross?
[02:58.800 --> 03:02.120]  I don't want to eat Bob Ross plant hair. That's not appetizing.
[03:03.820 --> 03:06.040]  It grows into a flowering plant.
[03:06.860 --> 03:07.580]  Okay. Edible?
[03:08.060 --> 03:08.820]  We knew that.
[03:09.220 --> 03:13.300]  It belongs to the mint family and is very easy to take care of.
[03:13.640 --> 03:15.640]  Can you eat chia seed plants?
[03:15.660 --> 03:20.240]  What is more interesting, children's pet, the chia pet or sea monkeys?
[03:20.820 --> 03:23.640]  Oh, I feel like chia pet is more relevant to today.
[03:24.060 --> 03:25.440]  More relevant or interesting?
[03:26.340 --> 03:26.740]  More relevant.
[03:26.740 --> 03:32.440]  I feel like sea monkeys are way older. I feel like that's not currently still a thing.
[03:33.040 --> 03:34.760]  I don't think... are chia pets still a thing?
[03:35.160 --> 03:38.920]  Like sea monkeys you would get off the back of a comic book from 1965.
[03:39.320 --> 03:43.020]  You would watch a chia pet commercial on Saturday morning cartoons.
[03:43.900 --> 03:44.240]  Oh, okay.
[03:44.700 --> 03:51.820]  I always found it disturbing that sea monkeys could just be like freeze-dried and still used later.
[03:51.820 --> 03:57.000]  Like, is there a pack of sea monkeys from a 60s comic that you could just put in water now and they'll come to life?
[03:57.220 --> 03:59.220]  That's how Jurassic Park happened.
[04:00.900 --> 04:01.680]  Sea monkeys.
[04:02.860 --> 04:05.760]  A mosquito goes apeshit and eats a bunch of sea monkeys.
[04:07.440 --> 04:09.040]  You could absolutely eat it.
[04:09.220 --> 04:15.000]  Chia sprouts have a tangy taste and add a variety and spice to salads, soups, spreads, dips, sandwiches and appetizers.
[04:15.080 --> 04:16.940]  I'll go ahead and throw condiments into that mix.
[04:17.420 --> 04:19.420]  Wow. That's quite the range.
[04:19.840 --> 04:20.020]  Yeah.
[04:20.500 --> 04:21.120]  No Eric today.
[04:21.120 --> 04:22.160]  No Eric.
[04:22.640 --> 04:24.080]  That means we can go for like three hours if we want to.
[04:24.080 --> 04:25.060]  We can go way longer.
[04:25.800 --> 04:27.540]  We haven't had...
[04:27.540 --> 04:31.040]  I feel like the last one had Eric but not Nick. And the one before that had no Eric.
[04:31.140 --> 04:33.160]  Have we had a full five recording recently?
[04:33.660 --> 04:36.940]  No. That's a great point. Yeah, I think it's been at least three weeks.
[04:37.560 --> 04:38.880]  Not since 144, Nick says.
[04:39.240 --> 04:45.920]  Gavin, have you just stumbled on some sort of a feud between Nick and Eric where they refused to be in the podcast together at the same time?
[04:46.480 --> 04:49.940]  There's definitely something going on. Although they did collaborate for Condor Man.
[04:49.940 --> 04:51.800]  They did. They got their shit together.
[04:52.160 --> 04:54.480]  They set their differences aside for Condor Man.
[04:55.380 --> 04:59.700]  It's really important to the kids that we do this. We gotta make sure this goes off without a hitch.
[05:00.040 --> 05:03.080]  We'll put our bullshit aside for this Condor Man screening.
[05:03.880 --> 05:07.840]  Man, I don't know when that's gonna come out because I don't know when anything's coming out.
[05:08.260 --> 05:13.500]  We've got... I was thinking... Emily the other day was like, whatever happened to that Gavin's best of the... best of f*** face thing?
[05:13.520 --> 05:15.400]  And I was like, oh yeah, I have no idea.
[05:16.100 --> 05:18.100]  When's that gonna come out? We got a sausage talk?
[05:18.100 --> 05:20.460]  I think that comes out the same day as sausage talk.
[05:21.080 --> 05:21.720]  When is that?
[05:22.320 --> 05:23.780]  Well, I don't know. I proofed it.
[05:24.760 --> 05:30.580]  I'm also halfway through proofing Condor Man. I told Andrew I was proofing Condor Man and Andrew was like, you're listening to that?
[05:31.220 --> 05:34.960]  I was confused. I didn't understand the technical side of like looking for errors.
[05:35.440 --> 05:38.860]  Isn't that why we listen to stuff before putting out? Make sure there's no...
[05:38.860 --> 05:41.460]  That's definitely a component to it. I just...
[05:41.460 --> 05:43.500]  You just seem blown away that someone was doing that.
[05:43.500 --> 05:50.480]  Well, because in my head, you're also scanning to give notes on like the flow and like rhythm and like, should there be an edit here?
[05:50.540 --> 05:57.540]  Should there be an edit? Because you've made those notes. I've seen those of like, oh, I think this should be timed a little bit differently comedically.
[05:57.860 --> 06:00.880]  So I didn't understand how you would make edits to a watch along.
[06:01.180 --> 06:06.500]  That's why I think that's one of the benefits of someone in the recording doing notes is they can give technical and...
[06:06.500 --> 06:11.160]  Also, like if you're going to edit the like, what's your... you can't do it. It's broken.
[06:11.480 --> 06:14.480]  What are you going to do to fix it? What are we doing at that point?
[06:14.720 --> 06:16.380]  In Condor Man, you mean? Because it'll go out of sync?
[06:16.760 --> 06:17.620]  Yeah, let's just say it's broken.
[06:17.620 --> 06:22.240]  If we didn't run something, we would just mute, wouldn't we? Because we're not chatting through... sometimes we're just watching.
[06:23.280 --> 06:27.360]  I just, I feel like it has such a unique experience of having to remain in sync.
[06:27.500 --> 06:31.400]  I imagine what you could do to actually correct issues is pretty limited without breaking it.
[06:31.820 --> 06:33.480]  I mean, I didn't give any notes to remove anything.
[06:33.940 --> 06:35.760]  Yeah, but I'm just saying, let's say it was broken.
[06:35.760 --> 06:40.060]  Let's say you found an audio error. What are we doing about that? What's the solution?
[06:40.540 --> 06:41.300]  Just lower that track.
[06:41.680 --> 06:42.040]  Yeah.
[06:42.100 --> 06:43.880]  Okay. You got to lower it. I see.
[06:44.520 --> 06:47.040]  That could be like a buzz or a hum or...
[06:47.040 --> 06:53.000]  No, the whole... you're asking what would I do? The whole point is I have no fucking idea. That's where my position is. I have no clue what I'd do.
[06:54.140 --> 06:59.800]  I'd probably... I'd be like, guys, we got to throw it away. We got to shelf this. We got to rerecord this section.
[06:59.800 --> 07:06.320]  We learned a lot from Condorman. We learned about... well, we learned about what Condorman is and we also learned why it's not a Disney+.
[07:09.160 --> 07:10.540]  Did you know...
[07:10.540 --> 07:14.660]  We all learned that we had different Michael Crawford entry points as well.
[07:14.700 --> 07:15.200]  That's true.
[07:15.260 --> 07:15.560]  We did.
[07:16.080 --> 07:16.900]  Oh, man.
[07:17.260 --> 07:21.060]  Did you know that Condorman made a return relatively recently?
[07:21.340 --> 07:21.680]  No.
[07:21.680 --> 07:30.600]  I was doing research about it. They put Condorman the toy, like a toy Condorman in like a Toy Story short that came out, I want to say, before a recent movie.
[07:30.940 --> 07:31.260]  No way.
[07:31.440 --> 07:40.980]  It's a little cute, like... it's a giant... it's like him in the Condor car. I don't think they ever named that vehicle, but it's like him with a giant head in the little Condor car. It's great. It looks cool.
[07:41.520 --> 07:44.200]  So maybe there's hope. Condorman might come back still.
[07:44.980 --> 07:47.140]  I mean, you know, Michael Crawford's still around me.
[07:47.660 --> 07:48.180]  He is.
[07:48.180 --> 07:51.460]  Yeah, I believe he is. Unless we talked about him too much.
[07:51.720 --> 07:53.600]  Let me just touch a bunch of keys.
[07:53.840 --> 07:54.180]  Yeah.
[07:54.660 --> 08:01.840]  Did I tell you how making that best of f*** face destroyed my ability to make f*** face for several weeks?
[08:02.280 --> 08:02.720]  No.
[08:04.200 --> 08:05.000]  What do you mean?
[08:05.260 --> 08:06.700]  It wrecked f*** face for me.
[08:06.920 --> 08:07.780]  Oh, wow, look.
[08:08.280 --> 08:08.980]  Yeah, it's the toy.
[08:09.040 --> 08:09.620]  Oh, that's amazing.
[08:09.640 --> 08:11.140]  Nick just posted a photo of it.
[08:11.160 --> 08:11.860]  That's a strong chin.
[08:12.460 --> 08:13.420]  Yeah, great chin.
[08:13.420 --> 08:19.760]  Well, basically I just, uh, I was originally just going to look for comments and like try and find funny stuff.
[08:19.820 --> 08:25.460]  But in the end, I just settled on just listening to every episode at, um, 1.5 times speed.
[08:27.400 --> 08:33.300]  And I got really, really used to hearing everyone talking really fast and sped up.
[08:33.420 --> 08:37.760]  I got used to hearing the theme tune all sped up and it just started to flow.
[08:37.760 --> 08:38.820]  It just started to make sense.
[08:38.900 --> 08:43.660]  And I was blowing through these episodes, you know, in like 45 minutes instead of an hour.
[08:43.760 --> 08:50.880]  And then when it got to actually recording one, like while I was doing that, everything felt so low energy and so slow.
[08:50.880 --> 08:53.640]  And I was like, why do all these episodes suck?
[08:53.780 --> 08:57.740]  And I just realized it's because I was used to listening to everyone sped up.
[08:58.020 --> 09:03.740]  Honestly, if you listen, listen to like 10 episodes of f*** face slightly sped up and then listen to one at normal speed.
[09:03.780 --> 09:05.060]  It's like we're all drunk.
[09:05.060 --> 09:10.380]  It's crazy how your brain just gets used to everyone talking really fast.
[09:10.560 --> 09:13.280]  Should we try to talk faster for you? Would that make this more engaging?
[09:13.480 --> 09:17.320]  No, I've already, I've already leveled it back out. It was about a month ago, but I mean, it would have been useful then.
[09:17.600 --> 09:18.660]  God damn, that's funny.
[09:19.640 --> 09:25.160]  That's how like our friend Patricia Gav, who we lived with, who was blind, she had text to speech on her phone.
[09:25.420 --> 09:30.820]  And so, but it was at like 2.75% like speed.
[09:30.820 --> 09:35.080]  So you, it was like two and a half times, you like, you couldn't, I couldn't make out one word.
[09:35.140 --> 09:36.780]  And she's like, got it, got it, got it. Okay, okay, okay.
[09:36.920 --> 09:38.440]  And you just look at her in awe.
[09:38.980 --> 09:43.540]  Yeah, people would message her and her phone would read it out like a machine gun and she'd get every, every part of it.
[09:43.540 --> 09:45.120]  It was like a machine gun, you're right, yeah.
[09:46.440 --> 09:48.480]  She could read an entire book in like eight minutes.
[09:52.880 --> 09:53.480]  Woo, man.
[09:54.500 --> 09:55.400]  How are you doing, Geoff?
[09:56.300 --> 09:57.780]  Uh, hey, that's a good question.
[09:57.780 --> 10:00.500]  How's everybody's, how's everybody's mouth? Everybody's mouth hurt like mine?
[10:01.180 --> 10:02.160]  Uh, I'm okay.
[10:02.640 --> 10:03.760]  Well, mine's good.
[10:04.060 --> 10:04.580]  That's good.
[10:04.920 --> 10:07.760]  Uh, I assume you went and had your 10% finished.
[10:08.080 --> 10:09.520]  I had my 10% finished.
[10:09.820 --> 10:10.240]  New crown?
[10:10.660 --> 10:14.840]  10% and a new crown somehow took, well, okay.
[10:15.480 --> 10:20.020]  I wasn't, I wasn't anticipating this being a story or a half story.
[10:20.120 --> 10:24.840]  So I cut off a part from the previous week that I just didn't want to get into.
[10:24.960 --> 10:26.420]  I was still a little traumatized by it.
[10:26.420 --> 10:29.280]  I told you that everything went well and it did eventually.
[10:29.740 --> 10:35.680]  But, um, the thing I didn't tell you guys is that, but now that I've got this other end, I might as well tell this part too.
[10:36.120 --> 10:42.680]  Uh, when I, I was so, even though I was on antibiotics and everything, it was so inflamed by the time I went in there and so angry.
[10:43.340 --> 10:45.600]  Um, cause it had been, you know, three weeks of this.
[10:45.860 --> 10:53.700]  Um, they gave me the numbing agent and the numbing shots, which are not the most fun in the world.
[10:53.700 --> 10:58.720]  But I've gotten so accustomed to getting them now that it's, it's like, you know, one gets used to the pain.
[10:59.400 --> 11:02.140]  That specific pain, uh, when you feel it a thousand times.
[11:02.720 --> 11:03.700]  You're numb to the numbing.
[11:04.160 --> 11:05.860]  I'm numb to the numbing within reason.
[11:06.480 --> 11:12.820]  Uh, so then what they do is they, after about, you know, like 10 minutes or whatever, they blow a little air on your tooth to see if you feel it.
[11:12.960 --> 11:16.560]  And when they did that to me, it feels like somebody is jabbing a hot poker into my brain.
[11:16.920 --> 11:19.920]  And so I was like, oh, it's not going to work. I'm going to need more numbing shots.
[11:20.320 --> 11:25.000]  Uh, I was so inflamed, they had to give me six rounds of shots.
[11:25.420 --> 11:26.200]  Oh my god.
[11:26.660 --> 11:29.660]  It took like 40 minutes to numb my mouth up.
[11:30.520 --> 11:31.880]  Are you building up a resistance?
[11:32.320 --> 11:34.420]  No, I was, I was fucking numb.
[11:34.600 --> 11:37.220]  I will say this time, so anyway, I went back. That was the part.
[11:37.520 --> 11:39.380]  I went back to get the 10% done.
[11:39.700 --> 11:41.600]  Uh, only needed one shot. I was fine this time.
[11:41.780 --> 11:43.160]  Like, I was totally fine with one shot.
[11:43.160 --> 11:51.260]  Uh, the previous time she had told me this story about how you have to be really careful and why she wanted to split it up into two sessions.
[11:51.700 --> 11:56.640]  You have to be really careful, uh, because these tools are very delicate and they can break off in your tooth.
[11:56.920 --> 12:00.820]  And if they do, the tool is stuck in your tooth.
[12:00.900 --> 12:03.100]  It doesn't, they can't really get it out easily.
[12:03.700 --> 12:07.320]  And it's not a big deal because it's sterile.
[12:07.760 --> 12:10.560]  Um, you know, and it doesn't harm anything.
[12:11.260 --> 12:15.920]  But, uh, you know, it's just like you want to avoid that if at all possible, obviously.
[12:16.340 --> 12:19.140]  And I'm like, yeah, that makes sense. Let's split it up into two sessions.
[12:19.700 --> 12:26.720]  Uh, so when I went in on Tuesday for the last 10%, which by the way, lasted over three hours, that last 10%.
[12:26.720 --> 12:31.820]  Um, that was, that was a real kick to the, kick to the balls emotionally.
[12:32.560 --> 12:35.600]  Uh, I did not, I thought I was going to go in there and be in and out in like 90 minutes.
[12:35.600 --> 12:38.360]  And it took over, it took longer than the first 90%.
[12:38.960 --> 12:44.660]  And, uh, part of the, part of that is because, uh, a tool broke off in my tooth.
[12:46.400 --> 12:47.120]  Which tool?
[12:47.840 --> 12:50.440]  Uh, just the thing that she was using to scrape out the root.
[12:50.580 --> 12:54.200]  And it was the last root. It was not a big deal.
[12:54.740 --> 12:59.960]  She was like, if you want, I can send you to an endodontist and they can try to get it out.
[13:00.040 --> 13:02.800]  And then they can, you can come back to me and we'll patch it up.
[13:03.240 --> 13:04.960]  She can put him in and she can't get him out?
[13:04.960 --> 13:07.880]  But she was like, but there's no reason to do that.
[13:08.260 --> 13:12.380]  It's in a safe place. It's tiny. It's sterile. It's not a big deal.
[13:12.420 --> 13:14.380]  This happens a lot. This is not uncommon.
[13:14.780 --> 13:18.060]  There's a lot of people walking around with a piece of tool in their tooth.
[13:18.460 --> 13:22.440]  I can just patch you back up. We're done. Put the root canal on and you can be on your way.
[13:22.520 --> 13:25.820]  So I was like, I could do this two more times or I could be done today. I'll be done today.
[13:26.080 --> 13:29.680]  So that's what we did. Um, my tooth's starting to hurt today.
[13:31.280 --> 13:33.580]  And I'm starting to, I'm starting to get a little paranoid.
[13:34.640 --> 13:36.880]  We'll see. I can't believe you.
[13:37.620 --> 13:41.480]  I understand where you're coming from, Geoff, but nothing about your mouth is normal.
[13:41.720 --> 13:44.480]  And nothing has ever gone the way that you'd want it to go.
[13:44.800 --> 13:49.400]  That crossed my mind in the moment, but I was so defeated and so deflated and I had been there for three hours.
[13:49.840 --> 13:53.500]  I just didn't have two more. I didn't have two more trips of drilling in me.
[13:53.620 --> 13:55.660]  And of course, now I'll probably end up having to do it anyway.
[13:56.200 --> 13:58.580]  But it was, I thought it was going to turn into like five.
[13:58.700 --> 14:00.240]  We'll see. We'll see. We'll see.
[14:00.720 --> 14:05.500]  I like the idea that they have to do a rescue mission for this tool because it's fucking up your tooth.
[14:05.860 --> 14:07.120]  They need to go in and save it.
[14:07.540 --> 14:08.660]  How's it in the tooth?
[14:09.380 --> 14:12.400]  Like in the canal. It's so deep in there and they can't get it out.
[14:12.960 --> 14:13.880]  It's just like a little tip.
[14:13.920 --> 14:16.920]  It's like a child in a well, Gavin.
[14:16.980 --> 14:19.160]  It's like the tip of a drill.
[14:20.500 --> 14:23.740]  They gotta get the drill tip out.
[14:23.900 --> 14:25.040]  A child in a well.
[14:25.920 --> 14:30.020]  Psychologically, in my head, there's the tip of a drill just tumbling around in my tooth.
[14:30.020 --> 14:31.040]  Poking into stuff.
[14:31.220 --> 14:32.800]  And I can't get that thought out of my head.
[14:32.840 --> 14:34.180]  I didn't sleep last night. At all.
[14:34.640 --> 14:36.760]  Do you think that that is making it worse?
[14:37.180 --> 14:38.700]  I think it's fucking with me.
[14:38.800 --> 14:41.080]  I am a victim of my own imagination.
[14:41.620 --> 14:43.300]  And I have been my entire life.
[14:43.520 --> 14:46.580]  And I've had to sit down and have a very serious talk with myself today.
[14:46.700 --> 14:50.240]  About knocking it off with this specifically.
[14:50.420 --> 14:53.400]  Because they told me my mouth would be sore for up to a week.
[14:53.680 --> 14:55.260]  And I googled it.
[14:55.360 --> 14:58.360]  And after a root canal, your mouth could be sore for up to a week.
[14:58.360 --> 15:03.000]  So I am trying to convince myself not to ascribe the pain I'm feeling to something larger.
[15:03.360 --> 15:08.220]  Because it's day one and a half after getting three hours of a mouth surgery.
[15:08.360 --> 15:10.680]  So of course my mouth is sore.
[15:10.980 --> 15:12.040]  Of course that tooth is sore.
[15:12.220 --> 15:14.420]  I ate last night for the first time on meat.
[15:14.680 --> 15:16.040]  And that hurt a little bit.
[15:16.140 --> 15:17.000]  Of course I probably ate.
[15:17.720 --> 15:19.060]  I'm sure I'm fine.
[15:19.260 --> 15:24.460]  But the kind of imagination that helps you start a podcast like F*** Face or a company like Rooster Teeth.
[15:24.520 --> 15:27.700]  Can be a real motherfucker when it's pointed in a negative direction.
[15:27.700 --> 15:28.840]  You know what I mean?
[15:29.240 --> 15:32.420]  So it's just f***ing hard to get out of my own head.
[15:32.900 --> 15:33.880]  What day are you on now?
[15:34.600 --> 15:36.180]  I got it done Tuesday, so today is Thursday.
[15:37.300 --> 15:38.600]  Okay, so you're on day two.
[15:39.020 --> 15:39.540]  Or day three.
[15:41.700 --> 15:42.700]  Well that's fine.
[15:42.820 --> 15:45.040]  You're going to be great next time, this time, next week.
[15:45.160 --> 15:45.700]  All good.
[15:46.380 --> 15:47.880]  We don't need to save that child that well.
[15:48.040 --> 15:49.460]  We just keep that well closed.
[15:49.900 --> 15:51.580]  That reminded me of...
[15:52.660 --> 15:55.820]  I don't think I've ever been so confident and then so let down.
[15:55.820 --> 16:01.920]  Than when we were doing a let's play in Family Feud.
[16:02.500 --> 16:06.840]  And the question was, name something that's easier to get into than out of.
[16:07.640 --> 16:11.720]  And I thought well was the best answer possible.
[16:11.840 --> 16:12.360]  Top answer.
[16:12.480 --> 16:16.180]  I was confident I was going to see that right at the top of the list.
[16:17.000 --> 16:18.100]  Not even on there.
[16:18.600 --> 16:19.480]  No, you're not wrong.
[16:19.700 --> 16:21.160]  I think prison was on there.
[16:22.180 --> 16:24.520]  But I was so... I could not believe it.
[16:24.520 --> 16:26.600]  I think well is a great answer.
[16:26.860 --> 16:28.640]  I hate Family Feud for that reason.
[16:29.220 --> 16:29.440]  Yes.
[16:29.560 --> 16:31.520]  People's answers don't make sense to me.
[16:32.720 --> 16:33.900]  It's like who are they serving?
[16:34.500 --> 16:34.700]  Yeah.
[16:36.140 --> 16:36.960]  It's so odd.
[16:37.040 --> 16:40.560]  I like the video game versions of it because of how quirky they are.
[16:40.680 --> 16:43.160]  Like how just weird the classifications could be.
[16:43.300 --> 16:44.020]  Oh, they're a gold mine.
[16:44.520 --> 16:50.840]  Yeah, I was playing with some friends and I won because it was related to like a thing you do with a pet.
[16:50.920 --> 16:52.560]  I don't remember the exact phrasing of the question.
[16:52.560 --> 16:56.380]  They went first and they put in pets.
[16:56.700 --> 16:57.720]  And I put in pet.
[16:58.260 --> 17:00.480]  And they got zero points for pets.
[17:00.620 --> 17:02.360]  And I got like 82 for pet.
[17:02.660 --> 17:03.820]  Because of an S.
[17:04.340 --> 17:05.680]  And it caused so much chaos.
[17:05.780 --> 17:07.700]  Just so much anger over the bullshit of that.
[17:07.740 --> 17:09.460]  And those games are just filled with that.
[17:09.600 --> 17:11.460]  And there's no appeal process.
[17:11.640 --> 17:14.660]  There's no real humans to give a look to.
[17:14.660 --> 17:14.880]  There's zero appeal process.
[17:15.220 --> 17:20.580]  It's also like 2022 and the question is what are things that are in teenagers rooms.
[17:20.580 --> 17:23.420]  And it's like CDs is the second answer.
[17:23.600 --> 17:24.740]  And it's like what are you talking about?
[17:25.860 --> 17:27.500]  When was this survey done?
[17:27.640 --> 17:30.340]  What mall was this done in in 1996?
[17:31.240 --> 17:34.980]  It's so important to know when the thing you're interacting with was made.
[17:35.400 --> 17:35.760]  Yes.
[17:35.900 --> 17:37.620]  Like it totally changes everything.
[17:37.800 --> 17:39.260]  Like games is like everything is out of date.
[17:39.820 --> 17:44.600]  Like movie commentaries, it changes the entire vibe if you don't know when it was recorded.
[17:45.020 --> 17:46.040]  That's true, yeah.
[17:46.500 --> 17:50.880]  Or like it'll be weird when things change in life.
[17:51.240 --> 17:54.580]  Like I remember listening to the Jersey Girl.
[17:54.700 --> 17:56.840]  That was the name of that Kevin Smith movie, right?
[17:57.360 --> 17:57.740]  Jersey Girl?
[17:58.420 --> 17:59.460]  Yeah, with Ben Affleck.
[18:00.100 --> 18:00.220]  Yeah.
[18:00.580 --> 18:04.360]  I listened to the commentary on that and Jennifer Lopez is in that.
[18:04.440 --> 18:05.120]  She dies.
[18:05.260 --> 18:06.740]  She's the wife that dies in the movie.
[18:07.280 --> 18:09.280]  Well thanks for the spoiler, I've never seen it.
[18:09.380 --> 18:10.220]  No, it's the opening.
[18:10.440 --> 18:11.780]  It's the whole premise of the movie.
[18:11.780 --> 18:12.180]  I've never seen that.
[18:12.380 --> 18:14.540]  Jennifer Lopez bleeps in the movie?
[18:17.020 --> 18:18.160]  What are you doing?
[18:18.620 --> 18:19.800]  I don't trust you.
[18:20.460 --> 18:22.200]  I was fixing the spoiler for him.
[18:22.700 --> 18:22.920]  Yeah.
[18:23.760 --> 18:24.200]  Oh!
[18:24.460 --> 18:25.200]  He bleeped it.
[18:25.520 --> 18:31.240]  I see, well we have a whole bleeping thing on this show, so I was trying to figure out how it related to that.
[18:31.560 --> 18:36.240]  Anyway, in his commentary he talks about their relationship not working out.
[18:36.420 --> 18:38.540]  Like it being the best, that they just are not a couple.
[18:38.760 --> 18:39.380]  In my memory.
[18:39.380 --> 18:40.900]  And now they're together again.
[18:41.460 --> 18:42.000]  This is funny.
[18:42.440 --> 18:43.760]  The context of time.
[18:45.120 --> 18:47.520]  Happily ever after they lived, it turns out.
[18:47.940 --> 18:48.380]  Apparently.
[18:49.020 --> 18:51.160]  Hey, speaking of movies and context.
[18:51.920 --> 18:54.840]  You know, I've been doing these weekly movie reviews for you guys.
[18:54.980 --> 18:56.680]  I've been watching movie again.
[18:57.240 --> 18:58.340]  Yeah, what is that about?
[19:00.220 --> 19:01.440]  What is it about?
[19:02.220 --> 19:02.900]  What do you mean?
[19:03.100 --> 19:05.860]  I just feel like we're in the lead up to a payoff.
[19:06.840 --> 19:08.540]  Well, here's the deal.
[19:08.540 --> 19:11.860]  I just decided that I was going to make 2023 the year of movie.
[19:12.400 --> 19:14.700]  I didn't watch any movies.
[19:14.740 --> 19:16.140]  I didn't really watch any movies.
[19:16.700 --> 19:17.840]  From the pandemic on.
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.240]  I took a movie break.
[19:20.120 --> 19:22.840]  And so now I'm trying to dip my toe back in.
[19:22.880 --> 19:25.120]  But I don't have a lot of time or patience.
[19:25.620 --> 19:26.660]  For sitting that long.
[19:26.820 --> 19:29.480]  So I like to watch a movie a week.
[19:30.080 --> 19:31.240]  So last week I watched two.
[19:31.340 --> 19:34.040]  Which is why you got a double review the last time.
[19:34.400 --> 19:36.760]  And as I was making a review for the new movie.
[19:36.900 --> 19:37.820]  That I watched this week.
[19:37.820 --> 19:38.260]  I thought.
[19:38.520 --> 19:40.840]  Oh, I probably am going to stop doing this.
[19:41.020 --> 19:42.520]  I don't want to keep doing this.
[19:43.340 --> 19:45.980]  And I think the audience will probably get tired of it pretty quickly.
[19:46.480 --> 19:48.580]  I'm not as concerned about YouTube being tired of it.
[19:48.640 --> 19:49.880]  But the audience I am.
[19:50.520 --> 19:51.640]  And so I thought.
[19:52.360 --> 19:54.200]  What if I do one last movie review.
[19:54.600 --> 19:56.460]  And I'll make a game out of it.
[19:56.840 --> 19:57.080]  Okay.
[19:57.180 --> 19:58.540]  And then that'll be a lot of fun.
[19:59.060 --> 20:00.320]  And I've been looking at that.
[20:00.460 --> 20:04.120]  I reviewed a direct-to-DVD.
[20:04.460 --> 20:05.700]  Direct-to-streaming movie.
[20:05.700 --> 20:08.640]  I reviewed a movie that's no longer in the theaters.
[20:08.640 --> 20:10.560]  But was nominated for an Academy Award.
[20:10.640 --> 20:13.900]  And I reviewed a movie that was about 65 years old.
[20:14.400 --> 20:14.820]  I thought.
[20:15.600 --> 20:16.860]  To go out with a bang.
[20:16.960 --> 20:18.080]  Unless the audience is like.
[20:18.140 --> 20:18.960]  No, please.
[20:19.240 --> 20:20.900]  Keep doing movie reviews every week.
[20:20.960 --> 20:21.640]  We can't get enough.
[20:21.960 --> 20:23.320]  But I think this is probably enough.
[20:23.920 --> 20:25.820]  I decided to go to see a new movie.
[20:26.200 --> 20:27.000]  That's in the theaters.
[20:27.200 --> 20:27.600]  Right now.
[20:27.740 --> 20:30.400]  So I could give you my impression of a film.
[20:30.400 --> 20:32.280]  And then if you.
[20:33.260 --> 20:34.660]  Gleaned that to be a positive.
[20:36.200 --> 20:36.620]  Impression.
[20:36.780 --> 20:38.620]  You could go see that movie at a theater yourself.
[20:38.780 --> 20:39.860]  And have that same experience.
[20:40.020 --> 20:42.240]  Or a similar experience to mine.
[20:42.500 --> 20:42.620]  Maybe.
[20:43.360 --> 20:44.160]  And I thought.
[20:44.940 --> 20:45.960]  As I was writing the review.
[20:46.240 --> 20:49.080]  What if I just give you guys the review for the movie.
[20:49.200 --> 20:51.500]  And then you have to guess what movie I'm talking about.
[20:52.260 --> 20:52.520]  Okay.
[20:52.720 --> 20:54.180]  I think this is a great game.
[20:54.480 --> 20:56.740]  I'm curious to see how this review goes.
[20:56.740 --> 20:59.180]  Because this is the first theatrical experience you had.
[20:59.540 --> 21:00.840]  This is a different viewing experience.
[21:01.700 --> 21:02.540]  You have to be.
[21:02.700 --> 21:04.960]  I think more locked in when you're in a movie theater.
[21:05.080 --> 21:06.800]  It's so easy to get distracted at home.
[21:06.860 --> 21:08.040]  You might look at your phone for a minute.
[21:08.380 --> 21:10.860]  I'm excited to see the difference between this review.
[21:11.140 --> 21:12.120]  I think it'll be difficult though.
[21:12.140 --> 21:14.940]  Because one of the statements about the last review.
[21:15.200 --> 21:17.120]  Was it's about a guy's forehead.
[21:18.060 --> 21:18.440]  Oh.
[21:18.740 --> 21:20.520]  Triangle of Sadness was about his forehead.
[21:21.060 --> 21:21.220]  Yeah.
[21:22.600 --> 21:24.560]  When he burrowed his frow.
[21:24.560 --> 21:26.240]  Oh, it created a triangle of sadness.
[21:26.640 --> 21:28.800]  He burrowed his frow.
[21:29.200 --> 21:30.480]  Yeah, he was a male model.
[21:30.720 --> 21:32.720]  And they were like, don't burrow your frow.
[21:32.900 --> 21:33.980]  It's a triangle of sadness.
[21:35.040 --> 21:36.920]  That's burying your wife in Germany.
[21:47.310 --> 21:48.550]  Okay, that's good, Gav.
[21:48.630 --> 21:51.330]  I had a lot to say about this movie.
[21:51.650 --> 21:52.630]  So I'll tell you this.
[21:52.630 --> 21:54.750]  It's a movie that's out right now.
[21:54.750 --> 21:56.810]  You can go see it in a theater in your town.
[21:56.970 --> 21:57.650]  Right now, probably.
[21:58.310 --> 22:00.330]  I won't tell you what kind of movie it is.
[22:00.730 --> 22:02.610]  It could be animated. It could be live action.
[22:02.610 --> 22:04.850]  It could be a documentary. It could be comedy. It could be horror.
[22:05.010 --> 22:06.870]  It could be drama. It could be suspense.
[22:06.950 --> 22:08.150]  It could be sports. Who knows?
[22:09.170 --> 22:10.570]  And I wanted to nail it.
[22:10.630 --> 22:12.730]  Because you're right, Andrew. I was definitely more locked in.
[22:12.810 --> 22:14.630]  Because I'm in the theater looking at it on a big screen.
[22:14.750 --> 22:16.390]  And I paid, you know, it's Alamo.
[22:16.550 --> 22:17.930]  So two people, it's like 80 bucks.
[22:17.990 --> 22:20.090]  So you want to get your money's worth out of it, right?
[22:21.010 --> 22:22.310]  And so I wrote it down.
[22:22.310 --> 22:23.290]  So here it is.
[22:23.830 --> 22:25.590]  This is my review for a movie I would like you to guess.
[22:26.570 --> 22:28.030]  First and foremost,
[22:28.590 --> 22:30.610]  the film is, for all intents and purposes,
[22:30.890 --> 22:32.590]  a treatise on the teardown
[22:32.590 --> 22:33.750]  of the nuclear family
[22:33.750 --> 22:35.750]  and our impact on the environment,
[22:35.890 --> 22:37.510]  both ethically and practically.
[22:37.770 --> 22:40.050]  It shows the delicate balance of both
[22:40.050 --> 22:42.270]  and then the ramifications when the pendulum
[22:42.270 --> 22:43.630]  swings too far in either direction.
[22:43.830 --> 22:46.290]  So it's about resilience, learning from the mistakes
[22:46.290 --> 22:47.690]  made from those pendulum swings,
[22:47.970 --> 22:49.510]  and then correcting and overcoming.
[22:49.510 --> 22:51.330]  But it's also about the dichotomy
[22:51.330 --> 22:52.710]  of the approach of said problems,
[22:52.830 --> 22:54.350]  from the masculine and the feminine,
[22:54.750 --> 22:56.630]  and the harmony and balance created
[22:56.630 --> 22:58.810]  when both are considered an equal measure,
[22:59.550 --> 23:01.670]  contrasted, unfortunately, by the stark reality
[23:01.670 --> 23:02.910]  of the failure
[23:03.330 --> 23:05.330]  of favoring the out-of-balance approach.
[23:05.590 --> 23:07.250]  And in that way, it's kind of
[23:07.250 --> 23:09.930]  about both redemption and condemnation.
[23:10.950 --> 23:11.830]  Curiously, though,
[23:12.070 --> 23:13.770]  which I think I didn't realize
[23:13.770 --> 23:15.090]  until I kind of picked up on until the end,
[23:15.290 --> 23:17.530]  this also relates and extends to the friendships
[23:17.530 --> 23:19.690]  that they make along the way, and the redemption
[23:19.690 --> 23:21.030]  of that kind of love,
[23:21.310 --> 23:23.470]  what it can bring both within oneself
[23:23.470 --> 23:25.310]  and then also to the relationship as a whole.
[23:25.470 --> 23:27.550]  So that's my review of the movie.
[23:28.410 --> 23:29.110]  First of all,
[23:29.550 --> 23:31.670]  I think this is my favorite review, by far,
[23:31.770 --> 23:33.010]  by you. Great review.
[23:33.610 --> 23:35.730]  I feel very strongly
[23:35.730 --> 23:37.610]  I think I know what it is. Gavin, do you
[23:37.610 --> 23:39.190]  think you know what it is? You have any guesses?
[23:39.370 --> 23:41.150]  You know what it is from that? I feel
[23:41.610 --> 23:43.250]  so confident. And I'm going to be honest, Geoff,
[23:43.250 --> 23:45.470]  when you started this, I've been so out of the loop
[23:45.470 --> 23:47.050]  with like current movies recently
[23:47.050 --> 23:49.470]  that I was thinking in my head, I don't know
[23:49.470 --> 23:51.590]  if I could name three movies that are currently
[23:51.590 --> 23:53.610]  playing right now. This is going to be a real
[23:53.610 --> 23:55.130]  tough game for me.
[23:55.390 --> 23:57.610]  But there is one. There is one that I'm
[23:57.610 --> 23:59.750]  aware of that is in theaters right now
[23:59.750 --> 24:01.570]  and I think it hits on
[24:01.570 --> 24:03.430]  some of the themes you're suggesting.
[24:03.570 --> 24:05.830]  I feel pretty good about it. I'd say my confidence,
[24:06.270 --> 24:07.630]  my movie guessing confidence,
[24:07.910 --> 24:09.550]  92 right now.
[24:09.870 --> 24:10.750]  Out of 100. I think.
[24:11.670 --> 24:13.410]  Now, do you want to, is there any guess
[24:13.410 --> 24:15.330]  you want to make, Gavin, before I make my guess?
[24:15.450 --> 24:17.370]  Do you have anything in mind? Do you want to just make a guess?
[24:18.950 --> 24:19.530]  Scream 6.
[24:21.430 --> 24:22.690]  Uh, okay.
[24:23.530 --> 24:25.410]  Should I answer if he's
[24:25.410 --> 24:26.410]  correct or not? Yeah, go ahead.
[24:27.670 --> 24:29.310]  It's funny you say that Scream 6
[24:29.310 --> 24:31.390]  was on the list of movies to see, but it was not
[24:31.390 --> 24:33.210]  Scream 6. Although it's interesting
[24:33.210 --> 24:35.190]  and I bet some of those themes are present in that film.
[24:36.630 --> 24:37.350]  I think
[24:38.010 --> 24:39.150]  that Geoff saw
[24:40.110 --> 24:40.470]  Creed.
[24:41.230 --> 24:42.650]  That's what I think. Creed 3.
[24:43.110 --> 24:44.130]  Creed 3.
[24:45.810 --> 24:46.610]  Okay, that's
[24:46.610 --> 24:48.470]  also incorrect because I haven't seen Creed 1 or 2.
[24:48.930 --> 24:50.810]  I wouldn't want to be... You were 92%
[24:50.810 --> 24:52.630]  on Creed. I was 92%
[24:52.630 --> 24:54.470]  on Creed. I wouldn't mind
[24:54.470 --> 24:56.210]  seeing Creed 3, but I'd need to see the first two
[24:56.210 --> 24:58.410]  to understand the backstory. Are you making as many
[24:58.410 --> 25:00.330]  of them as they were Rocky movies?
[25:00.470 --> 25:02.490]  I think so. I hope. Yeah, I think that's what the
[25:02.490 --> 25:03.390]  plan is, honestly, yeah.
[25:04.630 --> 25:05.690]  Nick, do you got a guess?
[25:07.190 --> 25:08.410]  I said Ant-Man
[25:08.410 --> 25:10.370]  and Quantumania. Oh, that's an
[25:10.370 --> 25:12.110]  interesting one because it's all about his
[25:12.670 --> 25:14.330]  daughter and going into the quantum
[25:14.330 --> 25:16.170]  realm or his own to save her and
[25:16.170 --> 25:18.270]  a bad guy and stuff. That's also incorrect.
[25:19.170 --> 25:20.110]  I give this movie
[25:20.110 --> 25:22.390]  10 out of 10 cocaines.
[25:22.530 --> 25:24.310]  I saw the movie Cocaine Bear. It was
[25:24.310 --> 25:26.370]  phenomenal. I recommend it to
[25:26.370 --> 25:27.010]  everybody.
[25:30.430 --> 25:32.190]  Cocaine Bear? Yeah, I saw
[25:32.190 --> 25:34.670]  Cocaine Bear. 10 out of 10 cocaines
[25:34.670 --> 25:35.610]  is what I would give this.
[25:35.610 --> 25:37.550]  This is baffling.
[25:37.970 --> 25:38.930]  Eric would have got that.
[25:39.550 --> 25:41.610]  I think he would have, yeah. He probably would
[25:41.610 --> 25:43.570]  have. I'm a little surprised y'all didn't, but I get
[25:43.570 --> 25:45.590]  it, you know. I mean, if you look at the movie, it's
[25:45.590 --> 25:47.630]  about a single mom trying to raise her daughter
[25:47.630 --> 25:49.570]  and then on the other side, it's about
[25:49.570 --> 25:51.650]  a single dad whose wife died who's trying to raise
[25:51.650 --> 25:53.490]  his son, but he can't handle
[25:53.490 --> 25:55.610]  the grief and so he flees from the scene
[25:55.610 --> 25:57.650]  and his friend has to chase him and he leaves him with his dad
[25:57.650 --> 25:59.830]  who's a terrible man and there's
[25:59.830 --> 26:01.470]  this overarching themes of masculinity
[26:01.470 --> 26:03.410]  while they're also in the delicate balance of
[26:03.410 --> 26:05.530]  the blood mountains in Georgia
[26:06.790 --> 26:07.670]  and mankind
[26:08.230 --> 26:09.310]  intrudes with cocaine
[26:09.310 --> 26:11.590]  addicting a bear who then runs rampant
[26:11.590 --> 26:13.490]  and destroys many, many people
[26:13.490 --> 26:15.150]  very grossly.
[26:15.770 --> 26:17.250]  I still think this could be Creed 3.
[26:17.250 --> 26:18.030]  A lot of really mature themes.
[26:19.290 --> 26:21.350]  Everything you said still could be Creed 3.
[26:22.370 --> 26:23.390]  I was so
[26:23.390 --> 26:25.230]  convinced. I wish I could see your review. I was like,
[26:25.330 --> 26:27.510]  oh, because Creed is about family, you know
[26:27.510 --> 26:29.470]  his dad was a boxer and I think this
[26:29.470 --> 26:31.530]  one is about him turning
[26:31.530 --> 26:33.650]  away, like, betraying his best friend
[26:33.650 --> 26:35.570]  as a kid or something. What movies aren't
[26:35.570 --> 26:36.970]  about family these days?
[26:37.730 --> 26:39.130]  That's a good point. Are there any?
[26:39.390 --> 26:40.390]  That's a good point.
[26:41.830 --> 26:42.790]  Triangle of Sadness?
[26:43.570 --> 26:45.630]  That doesn't seem like it's family oriented.
[26:47.670 --> 26:49.330]  That movie's definitely not about family.
[26:49.490 --> 26:51.630]  Scream 6, I bet you, is not about family.
[26:52.190 --> 26:53.690]  They literally say we're a family.
[26:54.290 --> 26:54.750]  Do they?
[26:56.650 --> 26:57.090]  Well,
[26:57.190 --> 26:59.510]  you can say you're a family, but it doesn't
[26:59.510 --> 27:00.950]  necessarily need to be about family.
[27:01.070 --> 27:03.290]  There's not a lot of that cast left
[27:03.290 --> 27:04.750]  from movie to movie to really
[27:05.270 --> 27:06.750]  constantly making new families.
[27:07.310 --> 27:07.890]  Franchise rules.
[27:08.970 --> 27:10.590]  Yeah, fair enough.
[27:12.030 --> 27:13.590]  I just can't believe you were so
[27:13.590 --> 27:14.010]  certain.
[27:14.530 --> 27:17.370]  I felt so good about it
[27:17.370 --> 27:18.430]  from the third word.
[27:19.290 --> 27:20.910]  I was like, yeah, I was.
[27:21.170 --> 27:23.570]  I had well confidence. This is an even better way
[27:23.570 --> 27:25.190]  of saying it. I felt I was
[27:25.870 --> 27:27.310]  99%. The third word, by the way, was
[27:27.310 --> 27:28.990]  foremost. So as soon as Andrew
[27:28.990 --> 27:30.510]  let me say foremost, he was like, oh, it's Creed.
[27:30.770 --> 27:31.390]  Creed 3.
[27:32.890 --> 27:35.150]  Everybody knows. They just will not stop saying
[27:35.150 --> 27:37.170]  foremost in those Creed movies. It's a weird
[27:37.170 --> 27:38.690]  trend. Everyone talks about it.
[27:39.370 --> 27:40.470]  Narrowed it down immensely.
[27:40.970 --> 27:43.130]  I just thought it would be fun to write a movie about
[27:43.130 --> 27:44.930]  Cocaine Bear, or a movie review about
[27:44.930 --> 27:46.890]  Cocaine Bear that featured no cocaine or bear.
[27:48.090 --> 27:48.950]  That is funny.
[27:49.390 --> 27:50.710]  Can we submit that to IMDb?
[27:51.510 --> 27:52.130]  Yeah, sure.
[27:53.890 --> 27:55.410]  I mean, the review stands.
[27:55.410 --> 27:57.530]  It's true. Everything I said is what the movie is about.
[27:57.970 --> 27:59.250]  I just tried to be a little broad
[27:59.250 --> 28:00.270]  with my strokes.
[28:01.110 --> 28:02.850]  I enjoyed those broad strokes.
[28:03.290 --> 28:05.250]  Easily my favorite review. I wish I could
[28:05.250 --> 28:07.190]  see it. That was one thing where I was
[28:07.190 --> 28:08.630]  trying to play it in my head because
[28:08.630 --> 28:11.230]  the wording and you're going with the speed
[28:11.230 --> 28:12.690]  you're going, it's easy to get lost.
[28:13.710 --> 28:15.230]  If I was trying to chase
[28:15.230 --> 28:17.210]  Cocaine Bear in your writing, it would have
[28:17.210 --> 28:18.870]  got away pretty early on for me.
[28:19.770 --> 28:20.150]  But...
[28:20.830 --> 28:23.310]  that was fun. That was by far my favorite movie
[28:23.310 --> 28:24.150]  segment you've done, Geoff.
[28:24.990 --> 28:26.330]  I would welcome more.
[28:27.210 --> 28:29.310]  I don't have anything planned for the
[28:29.310 --> 28:31.390]  immediate future, but if people want
[28:31.390 --> 28:33.410]  more, then let me know and I can always come up with something.
[28:33.670 --> 28:34.590]  Maybe you should do one a quarter.
[28:35.490 --> 28:36.730]  Yeah, maybe I could do one a quarter.
[28:37.330 --> 28:39.390]  I have a bone to pick with
[28:39.390 --> 28:41.250]  Andrew, but I can't remember if I've already
[28:41.250 --> 28:42.190]  picked this bone.
[28:43.690 --> 28:44.170]  Pick it again.
[28:45.110 --> 28:47.030]  You just tell me if I've already picked it.
[28:47.130 --> 28:48.410]  Go ahead, bring it on.
[28:48.570 --> 28:51.210]  Remember when I made the bean hole
[28:51.210 --> 28:53.270]  video and I submitted it and no one
[28:53.270 --> 28:55.130]  gave me any notes? Same with the
[28:55.130 --> 28:57.030]  baseball video and it just sat there, unuploaded
[28:57.030 --> 28:58.150]  for months.
[28:59.390 --> 29:00.170]  Yeah, that was a real
[29:01.150 --> 29:01.950]  unfortunate thing.
[29:02.210 --> 29:04.870]  He gave me a bit of grief.
[29:04.990 --> 29:07.490]  He was like, I was really excited to see that.
[29:08.090 --> 29:09.450]  Do you know that he still hasn't seen it?
[29:10.030 --> 29:10.370]  No.
[29:10.990 --> 29:13.110]  That's not what I said. This is an old
[29:13.110 --> 29:13.430]  bone.
[29:14.350 --> 29:15.650]  Have I picked it?
[29:16.050 --> 29:18.510]  No, you haven't picked it. Not on the show.
[29:18.510 --> 29:20.050]  This is a conversation we had
[29:20.050 --> 29:22.230]  weeks ago. What haven't you seen?
[29:22.970 --> 29:24.170]  The bean hole video.
[29:24.650 --> 29:25.170]  Really?
[29:26.170 --> 29:28.290]  You know there was the original
[29:28.290 --> 29:30.650]  bean hole video that came out
[29:30.650 --> 29:32.710]  and the original baseball video that came
[29:32.710 --> 29:34.470]  out. They were just snippets to play
[29:34.470 --> 29:35.450]  mid-episode though.
[29:36.050 --> 29:38.490]  And then you made the extended ones.
[29:38.770 --> 29:40.530]  I don't remember if I've seen the other
[29:40.530 --> 29:42.570]  ones, was what I told you. I don't think
[29:42.570 --> 29:44.630]  I have. I think I just forgot.
[29:45.630 --> 29:46.590]  I was
[29:46.590 --> 29:48.530]  really excited to watch them, but I also
[29:48.530 --> 29:50.050]  don't believe I would have done that.
[29:50.430 --> 29:52.590]  So I'm not sure. I may or may not have seen them.
[29:53.490 --> 29:54.610]  That's where we left
[29:54.610 --> 29:56.670]  off. You've either not seen it or
[29:56.670 --> 29:58.570]  it's so unmemorable you don't know if you've seen it.
[29:59.010 --> 30:00.570]  Well, you know, a lot has happened.
[30:00.690 --> 30:02.510]  Time has passed. I'm not
[30:02.510 --> 30:03.650]  entirely sure.
[30:04.590 --> 30:06.570]  Andrew, I'll say, if
[30:06.570 --> 30:08.430]  you want to be, it's better to be safe than sorry.
[30:08.530 --> 30:10.170]  And if you want, you can head on down to the
[30:10.170 --> 30:12.470]  F*** Face Pod YouTube channel
[30:12.470 --> 30:13.770]  and watch both of them.
[30:13.770 --> 30:15.470]  I do need to revisit them.
[30:15.630 --> 30:17.710]  I meant to do that that evening, but then once
[30:17.710 --> 30:19.490]  again I forgot. But yeah, that's fair.
[30:19.830 --> 30:21.830]  It's fair to be annoyed by that
[30:21.830 --> 30:23.670]  if I haven't seen them. I should
[30:23.670 --> 30:25.770]  remember if I did. No matter what, I feel I'm in the
[30:25.770 --> 30:27.550]  wrong here. He saw the highlights.
[30:27.690 --> 30:29.510]  What more does he need to see? All the boring s*** that
[30:29.510 --> 30:30.490]  we cut out?
[30:31.270 --> 30:33.350]  I definitely watched the pizza videos.
[30:34.310 --> 30:35.850]  The pizza videos were great.
[30:36.350 --> 30:37.590]  Big fan of pizza videos.
[30:38.190 --> 30:39.330]  Oh, thank you very much.
[30:39.450 --> 30:41.550]  Speaking of videos, Does It Do is back out again.
[30:41.550 --> 30:42.910]  And RT Animation...
[30:42.910 --> 30:44.330]  Regulation Animation is back out.
[30:45.030 --> 30:47.270]  I today proofed an animation.
[30:47.770 --> 30:48.830]  Regulation Animation of
[30:49.950 --> 30:51.590]  me talking to my ringtone
[30:51.590 --> 30:52.610]  and a recording of Dan.
[30:52.790 --> 30:54.550]  It's so freaking accurate.
[30:54.930 --> 30:57.330]  It's an amazing... It like really helps out
[30:57.330 --> 30:58.110]  the story, I feel.
[30:58.810 --> 31:00.890]  Dude, I showed that one to Millie and she was
[31:00.890 --> 31:02.630]  losing it watching it. It was great.
[31:03.210 --> 31:04.330]  Yeah, it's very funny.
[31:04.890 --> 31:06.390]  And Dan looks great.
[31:07.070 --> 31:09.190]  He does. He looks awesome.
[31:09.190 --> 31:10.810]  I didn't have to say that.
[31:11.430 --> 31:12.730]  Really nailed Dan.
[31:14.310 --> 31:17.270]  Yeah, the only s*** part of that video
[31:17.270 --> 31:18.230]  was the end.
[31:23.130 --> 31:24.290]  Same old...
[31:24.290 --> 31:25.850]  Same old clip of Eric there.
[31:27.630 --> 31:28.650]  Still on there.
[31:33.100 --> 31:34.800]  But other than that, no complaints.
[31:35.120 --> 31:35.860]  Perfect video.
[31:39.480 --> 31:40.720]  Somebody hates...
[31:40.720 --> 31:43.160]  Somebody in that department specifically hates you.
[31:45.380 --> 31:46.300]  I can feel it.
[31:46.360 --> 31:47.000]  They also...
[31:47.780 --> 31:49.420]  They also work for Cosmic Crisp.
[31:49.980 --> 31:52.040]  That's the same person.
[31:52.340 --> 31:54.260]  Yeah, they have a cousin who works at Cosmic Crisp.
[31:54.820 --> 31:56.180]  Hey, they finally acknowledged me there.
[31:56.440 --> 31:57.140]  I'm making...
[31:57.140 --> 31:58.180]  It's true.
[31:59.900 --> 32:00.140]  Congratulations.

[35:52.640 --> 35:54.800]  and the main perk back then,

[37:22.640 --> 37:24.100]  It was such a weird...
[37:24.580 --> 37:26.640]  She was talking about...
[37:26.640 --> 37:28.440]  I went to use her microwave
[37:28.440 --> 37:30.580]  and I noticed that there was a burn
[37:30.580 --> 37:32.600]  mark in the middle of it, just in the
[37:32.600 --> 37:34.280]  plate. It was like this black circle.
[37:34.820 --> 37:36.500]  And I was like, what's going on with that?
[37:37.020 --> 37:38.640]  And she said, yeah, so what happened
[37:38.640 --> 37:40.820]  was, I was getting rid of stuff
[37:40.820 --> 37:42.640]  and she gets really obsessive about
[37:42.640 --> 37:44.700]  recycling, and she's like, I wanted to get
[37:44.700 --> 37:46.620]  rid of this candle that was
[37:46.620 --> 37:48.660]  in a... it has a container around
[37:48.660 --> 37:50.620]  it, but there's still wax in it, and I
[37:50.620 --> 37:52.520]  couldn't just throw the wax in for where I was
[37:52.520 --> 37:54.740]  going to recycle it with the container.
[37:55.080 --> 37:56.780]  So I needed to try to get the wax
[37:56.780 --> 37:58.240]  out, and I couldn't figure out
[37:58.240 --> 38:00.620]  a way to get the wax out of
[38:00.620 --> 38:02.620]  the thing. And I tried with
[38:02.620 --> 38:04.900]  I think she said like a fork or a knife
[38:04.900 --> 38:06.600]  and she couldn't get it out that way.
[38:07.100 --> 38:08.540]  And then she said, yeah,
[38:08.620 --> 38:09.860]  so then I was like, well, how can I
[38:09.860 --> 38:12.600]  get rid of this? I'll put it in the microwave.
[38:13.260 --> 38:14.640]  So she tried to microwave
[38:14.640 --> 38:16.640]  the candle, but the base of the
[38:16.640 --> 38:17.880]  wick part is metal.
[38:17.880 --> 38:19.960]  And so she just put like metal
[38:19.960 --> 38:21.660]  in the microwave, and it burnt
[38:21.660 --> 38:23.800]  the bottom of the microwave.
[38:24.520 --> 38:25.200]  And so that was
[38:25.840 --> 38:28.260]  her cleaning it, and I'm just watching
[38:28.260 --> 38:29.880]  her explain this story
[38:29.880 --> 38:31.920]  going, why are you making every
[38:31.920 --> 38:34.020]  step along the way? Why did you make that
[38:34.020 --> 38:35.740]  choice? Why did you do that?
[38:36.120 --> 38:38.020]  And then she finishes, and I said, why didn't
[38:38.020 --> 38:39.380]  you just light the candle?
[38:40.320 --> 38:41.920]  Why didn't you just light it
[38:41.920 --> 38:43.980]  to melt the wax? And her
[38:43.980 --> 38:46.160]  response was, oh, I didn't think of that.
[38:46.160 --> 38:47.920]  That's a way better idea than what I did.
[38:48.120 --> 38:50.100]  What are you talking about? You didn't
[38:50.100 --> 38:51.880]  think of that. What are you saying?
[38:51.880 --> 38:53.920]  That is perfect. And I'm just
[38:54.720 --> 38:56.060]  mad. I'm annoyed
[38:56.060 --> 38:57.980]  by the whole scenario, but I'm also like,
[38:58.120 --> 38:59.680]  fuck, that's my DNA.
[39:00.180 --> 39:02.140]  This is me. Yeah, now you
[39:02.140 --> 39:04.200]  know how we feel all the time. I get
[39:04.200 --> 39:05.940]  it. It's insane.
[39:06.480 --> 39:07.680]  She's, oh, she's ridiculous.
[39:08.080 --> 39:09.280]  It's Panton logic.
[39:09.780 --> 39:11.960]  It is. It's
[39:11.960 --> 39:14.260]  fucked. It's so fucked. She was telling
[39:14.260 --> 39:16.220]  me. This happened a long
[39:16.220 --> 39:18.320]  time ago. She just got the confidence to tell me.
[39:20.420 --> 39:21.740]  That's also Panton logic.
[39:22.360 --> 39:24.400]  I feel like that would be so far
[39:24.400 --> 39:26.320]  down. Like, even if I couldn't
[39:26.320 --> 39:28.160]  light the candle, I'd maybe boil some water,
[39:28.260 --> 39:29.560]  put it in there, loosen it up.
[39:30.240 --> 39:32.160]  Just to be clear, the candle
[39:32.160 --> 39:34.280]  thing, I think that happened recently. I was
[39:34.280 --> 39:36.160]  going into a different story of
[39:36.160 --> 39:38.360]  something that happened eight months ago.
[39:39.100 --> 39:40.680]  I tried to do...
[39:40.680 --> 39:42.220]  I'm not, you know, like, the
[39:42.220 --> 39:43.820]  moon charts and all that shit.
[39:44.100 --> 39:46.200]  It's not something I'm really into, but it's been
[39:46.200 --> 39:47.980]  in my feed for some reason. Do you mean
[39:47.980 --> 39:50.080]  astrology or moon charts?
[39:50.260 --> 39:52.440]  I don't know what I'm saying. Astrology
[39:52.440 --> 39:54.020]  or just that whole thing. That whole
[39:54.020 --> 39:56.260]  field. I don't really know. It's like your time
[39:56.260 --> 39:58.260]  of birth and, like, the moon and all
[39:58.260 --> 40:00.140]  that. I suck so Eric's not here because
[40:00.140 --> 40:02.100]  his small wife loves that. Yeah.
[40:02.420 --> 40:03.960]  She's so into it. Super into it. He is
[40:03.960 --> 40:06.120]  secretly too. And it's
[40:06.720 --> 40:08.080]  popping up in my feed and I'm like,
[40:08.120 --> 40:09.840]  I don't really know what this is.
[40:09.840 --> 40:11.280]  I'll do whatever. I'll do it.
[40:11.720 --> 40:13.900]  And so I put in. I found the info.
[40:14.160 --> 40:15.720]  I tried to really answer
[40:15.720 --> 40:17.740]  the questions accurately. I invested
[40:17.740 --> 40:19.680]  time. All while knowing
[40:19.680 --> 40:21.980]  this is probably going to ask for my email
[40:21.980 --> 40:23.780]  at the end of it. And that's fine.
[40:23.840 --> 40:25.760]  I'm not thrilled to give them my email, but
[40:25.760 --> 40:27.340]  I can live with that. So I go through it.
[40:28.160 --> 40:29.740]  As I expected, they asked for
[40:29.740 --> 40:31.500]  my email. I give them my email.
[40:31.860 --> 40:33.580]  Then I get another screen that says
[40:33.580 --> 40:36.060]  you have to pay 50 cents for this.
[40:36.320 --> 40:37.380]  And I was like, nah, fuck you.
[40:37.380 --> 40:39.260]  I'm not giving you 50 cents.
[40:39.740 --> 40:41.040]  I'm not just putting my information
[40:41.040 --> 40:42.900]  into this random thing.
[40:43.560 --> 40:45.120]  And so I
[40:45.120 --> 40:47.320]  canceled it. Didn't do it. I was talking to
[40:47.320 --> 40:48.860]  my mom about it. She's like, yeah.
[40:49.580 --> 40:50.460]  I, uh...
[40:51.280 --> 40:53.660]  I did an IQ test online.
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.480]  And I spent a lot
[40:55.480 --> 40:57.620]  of time on this IQ test.
[40:57.700 --> 40:59.200]  And I thought I did really well.
[40:59.260 --> 41:01.220]  I thought I nailed it. And I got to the end.
[41:01.700 --> 41:03.660]  And then they asked me for like a dollar.
[41:04.280 --> 41:05.220]  And this is
[41:05.220 --> 41:07.320]  a whole scam thing. But the bank blocked it.
[41:07.980 --> 41:08.600]  I was like, what?
[41:09.220 --> 41:11.280]  What do you mean? You just said
[41:11.280 --> 41:13.240]  it's a scam thing, but the
[41:13.240 --> 41:15.320]  bank blocked it. Did you try to give
[41:15.320 --> 41:17.300]  them the dollar? She's like, yes.
[41:17.740 --> 41:19.420]  Yes, I did. And the bank
[41:19.420 --> 41:21.140]  blocked the charge. So it's all good.
[41:21.740 --> 41:23.360]  I was like, what are you...
[41:23.360 --> 41:25.220]  what organization... first
[41:25.220 --> 41:27.380]  of all, you have failed the IQ test.
[41:27.620 --> 41:28.960]  I don't care the answer
[41:29.700 --> 41:31.440]  you gave to any question
[41:31.440 --> 41:32.260]  leading to this.
[41:32.260 --> 41:33.700]  Do you think that blocks you out?
[41:34.100 --> 41:34.620]  That's an F.
[41:36.540 --> 41:38.480]  That's a 10 point deduction
[41:38.480 --> 41:39.780]  right there. That's a flunk.
[41:39.940 --> 41:42.220]  That's an immediate flunk. It doesn't matter.
[41:42.840 --> 41:44.240]  But also, do you
[41:44.240 --> 41:46.220]  know, like, the scandal
[41:46.220 --> 41:48.080]  is like the depravity of the
[41:48.080 --> 41:50.360]  organization that you're trying to give money to
[41:50.360 --> 41:52.080]  that your bank blocked
[41:52.080 --> 41:53.460]  a one dollar charge?
[41:53.780 --> 41:55.600]  Have you ever heard of a one dollar?
[41:55.740 --> 41:58.020]  That the bank intervened for a dollar.
[41:58.900 --> 41:59.980]  I've never heard of that.
[41:59.980 --> 42:01.880]  Maybe that's common. I just have never heard of it.
[42:01.920 --> 42:03.800]  Was it the small amount that triggered that? Or was it just
[42:03.800 --> 42:05.620]  a shady organization flag?
[42:06.820 --> 42:07.700]  I hope...
[42:07.700 --> 42:09.020]  Either way, I was like, what are you doing?
[42:09.020 --> 42:11.860]  Typically you gotta buy like a thousand dollars worth of pillows to trigger
[42:11.860 --> 42:12.760]  something like that.
[42:13.020 --> 42:15.260]  Yeah, I triggered it when I tried to spend
[42:15.260 --> 42:17.820]  $500 on bananas to Geoff's house
[42:17.820 --> 42:19.880]  the last time. Like, you have to spend some
[42:19.880 --> 42:21.780]  money to get that text.
[42:21.780 --> 42:24.080]  It can't be the low amount, otherwise you probably would have had your bank
[42:24.080 --> 42:25.060]  block your chia seed.
[42:25.520 --> 42:27.800]  I think it was probably trying to give
[42:27.800 --> 42:29.800]  a dollar to Scammy McScammington
[42:30.380 --> 42:31.780]  and the bank was like, wait a second.
[42:32.260 --> 42:34.000]  You might want to evaluate
[42:34.000 --> 42:34.600]  this one.
[42:35.740 --> 42:37.760]  Anyway, that's my mom. It was mainly the candle thing.
[42:37.900 --> 42:39.320]  I was like, oh my god.
[42:39.540 --> 42:41.760]  Can I say something?
[42:41.900 --> 42:43.980]  You triggered a microwave gripe
[42:43.980 --> 42:44.500]  I have.
[42:45.100 --> 42:46.720]  It just popped into my head.
[42:47.620 --> 42:49.680]  I'm a little annoyed by it. Not annoyed.
[42:49.760 --> 42:51.540]  Annoyed's not right. Frustrated.
[42:52.060 --> 42:52.460]  Frustrated.
[42:53.120 --> 42:57.220]  When I was growing up, I have a pet
[42:57.220 --> 42:59.020]  peeve about microwaves.
[42:59.140 --> 43:01.160]  And my pet peeve is, if you're going to put
[43:01.160 --> 43:02.760]  food in my microwave,
[43:03.100 --> 43:04.820]  cover the plate
[43:04.820 --> 43:07.040]  with Saran wrap or a paper towel
[43:07.040 --> 43:08.980]  or something, because there is nothing
[43:08.980 --> 43:10.960]  grosser than somebody pulls their spaghetti
[43:10.960 --> 43:12.780]  out of your microwave and it looks like
[43:12.780 --> 43:15.160]  you tried to steal a jacket
[43:15.160 --> 43:16.780]  from a store and the thing went off.
[43:17.480 --> 43:19.400]  And painted the entire
[43:19.400 --> 43:20.260]  inside of the microwave.
[43:22.120 --> 43:23.160]  And it's
[43:23.160 --> 43:25.220]  fucking gross and then it gets caked on and it
[43:25.220 --> 43:26.920]  turns yellow and red and you just get these weird
[43:26.920 --> 43:29.060]  stains and I don't want to put my
[43:29.060 --> 43:31.080]  food in that weird, dirty
[43:31.080 --> 43:33.140]  food cave anymore. And I
[43:33.140 --> 43:34.420]  have this pet peeve
[43:35.160 --> 43:37.160]  because when I was a kid, my
[43:37.160 --> 43:38.640]  mother had that pet peeve.
[43:38.960 --> 43:41.080]  And if I ever dared to put
[43:41.620 --> 43:43.140]  food in uncovered, I would
[43:43.140 --> 43:45.240]  hear about it. And I always had to clean up
[43:45.240 --> 43:47.180]  the mess and if anybody in the
[43:47.180 --> 43:49.020]  world did it, I had to clean it up. And so I
[43:49.020 --> 43:50.760]  inherited my mother's
[43:50.760 --> 43:53.080]  pet peeve, which I would honestly say was good
[43:53.080 --> 43:55.280]  parenting on her part. This is a pet peeve I'm happy to have.
[43:56.940 --> 43:59.260]  A couple months ago, my mom came to stay with me
[43:59.920 --> 44:01.100]  and I watched her
[44:01.100 --> 44:03.080]  microwave her dinner and
[44:03.080 --> 44:05.080]  she didn't put a paper towel
[44:05.080 --> 44:06.940]  on top of it. I didn't say anything.
[44:07.180 --> 44:09.080]  I just ate it. I ate it. But I've been
[44:09.080 --> 44:11.020]  thinking about it since. You didn't say anything?
[44:11.300 --> 44:12.100]  The hypocrisy.
[44:12.960 --> 44:14.800]  I love my mom. She's a saint.
[44:15.100 --> 44:16.740]  She's an angel. She's the
[44:16.740 --> 44:18.780]  greatest woman on earth. She's lovely.
[44:18.920 --> 44:20.700]  You know her, Gav. Yeah, she's the best.
[44:21.060 --> 44:22.780]  I'm not going to attack my poor mom.
[44:22.860 --> 44:24.140]  At least not in person. I'll do it on a podcast.
[44:26.340 --> 44:28.500]  I was so shocked.
[44:28.720 --> 44:29.980]  I was dumbfounded.
[44:31.300 --> 44:32.520]  Did something change?
[44:32.780 --> 44:34.780]  Did she read a news story that was like
[44:34.780 --> 44:36.380]  you don't need to do this anymore? What happened?
[44:36.580 --> 44:38.680]  Did the technology escalate?
[44:38.860 --> 44:40.520]  I think the reality is she probably just
[44:40.520 --> 44:42.840]  wasn't paying attention and forgot or was distracted
[44:42.840 --> 44:44.620]  or was in the middle of a conversation or
[44:44.620 --> 44:46.540]  whatever, you know? You know what it could have been?
[44:47.060 --> 44:48.900]  What's that? Maybe she thought you deserved it.
[44:49.520 --> 44:50.920]  For blowing up her microwave
[44:50.920 --> 44:51.500]  in your youth.
[44:52.500 --> 44:54.780]  That's true. You know what?
[44:55.100 --> 44:55.980]  That tracks.
[44:57.580 --> 44:59.040]  I used to do
[44:59.040 --> 45:00.460]  a lot of bad stuff with microwaves
[45:01.020 --> 45:03.100]  when I was a kid. I was a little microwave
[45:03.100 --> 45:03.440]  hoodlum.
[45:06.260 --> 45:07.040]  That would make
[45:07.040 --> 45:08.560]  sense. That checks out.
[45:09.620 --> 45:10.900]  It could be a home and away
[45:10.900 --> 45:12.760]  thing. Maybe she doesn't cover on the road.
[45:13.240 --> 45:14.360]  Only covers at home.
[45:14.980 --> 45:16.900]  Well, even if it was intentional and it
[45:16.900 --> 45:18.980]  was to get back, I probably deserved it.
[45:19.920 --> 45:21.040]  Once again, no harm,
[45:21.120 --> 45:21.520]  no foul.
[45:23.060 --> 45:24.180]  You triggered that
[45:24.680 --> 45:27.000]  memory in my head. That microwave story
[45:27.000 --> 45:28.720]  also triggered something in my head.
[45:29.140 --> 45:30.500]  The pantin logic of
[45:30.500 --> 45:32.820]  you've got the answer in your hand and you're not
[45:32.820 --> 45:34.760]  using it. I was recently filming
[45:34.760 --> 45:36.820]  with Dan and we were trying to shoot
[45:36.820 --> 45:38.840]  through a bunch of Lego men with a
[45:38.840 --> 45:40.640]  bullet. We had like 50 Lego men
[45:40.640 --> 45:42.720]  and the wind kept blowing them over. They were all
[45:42.720 --> 45:44.380]  on this table. So Dan was like,
[45:44.380 --> 45:45.460]  Oh yeah, we'll just
[45:46.180 --> 45:47.980]  stick them on some tape.
[45:48.400 --> 45:50.520]  I have a big strip of upside down tape
[45:50.520 --> 45:52.060]  and put that on the table.
[45:52.880 --> 45:53.720]  Do you know how we
[45:54.700 --> 45:56.200]  attach the tape to the table?
[45:59.240 --> 46:00.160]  How would you have done it?
[46:00.480 --> 46:02.380]  I would double side it and
[46:02.380 --> 46:03.740]  then I'd put it down. It's an option.
[46:04.040 --> 46:05.760]  I'd fold it and double side it.
[46:06.320 --> 46:08.400]  Or tear a bit off maybe and just tape
[46:08.400 --> 46:10.440]  each end of the tape down to the wood.
[46:10.540 --> 46:11.280]  Yeah, could do that too.
[46:11.280 --> 46:11.720]  Yeah.
[46:13.260 --> 46:14.740]  Dan goes over to the toolbox
[46:15.280 --> 46:17.060]  and screws the tape to the table
[46:17.060 --> 46:18.440]  with a washer and a screw.
[46:23.340 --> 46:24.340]  And he was like
[46:24.340 --> 46:27.280]  this is the first thing that came
[46:27.280 --> 46:28.780]  to my head. I was like,
[46:28.800 --> 46:30.280]  it's in your hand!
[46:32.520 --> 46:33.600]  What do you mean?
[46:36.600 --> 46:38.120]  And then he was like,
[46:38.120 --> 46:39.940]  it doesn't matter, I've done it now.
[46:40.100 --> 46:42.020]  I'm like, yeah, but now there's this
[46:42.020 --> 46:44.280]  really ugly reflection bouncing
[46:44.280 --> 46:46.140]  off the screw and now one of the
[46:46.140 --> 46:48.240]  lego men has a giant gap
[46:48.240 --> 46:50.160]  between it and the next one because there's a screw
[46:50.160 --> 46:52.240]  in there. I was just listing all these
[46:52.240 --> 46:53.460]  reasons why it was terrible.
[46:54.140 --> 46:56.100]  I would love to bounce around
[46:56.100 --> 46:57.460]  in his brain for a day.
[46:57.760 --> 46:58.680]  Oh my god.
[47:00.480 --> 47:02.160]  Just a big old screw.
[47:04.100 --> 47:04.500]  Screwed
[47:06.180 --> 47:08.360]  I thought you were going to say glued it down or something.
[47:08.620 --> 47:08.880]  No!
[47:10.020 --> 47:11.420]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[47:12.660 --> 47:14.160]  I've been thinking about for the past couple days.
[47:15.000 --> 47:15.800]  I asked this to Eric.
[47:17.840 --> 47:20.080]  We don't need to get his answer, but I already got it.
[47:21.120 --> 47:22.120]  What do you think
[47:22.120 --> 47:24.200]  would happen if you hit
[47:24.200 --> 47:25.860]  a nuclear power plant
[47:26.320 --> 47:27.800]  with a nuclear bomb?
[47:27.800 --> 47:28.560]  Jesus.
[47:30.720 --> 47:31.540]  Has anybody
[47:31.540 --> 47:33.800]  ever thought of that before? Like, there's never been
[47:33.800 --> 47:35.880]  like some Rennie Harlan movie
[47:35.880 --> 47:37.540]  or Michael Bay movie
[47:37.540 --> 47:39.620]  about somebody trying to nuclear bomb
[47:39.620 --> 47:41.820]  a nuclear power plant, but that
[47:41.820 --> 47:43.860]  seems like the most destructive thing
[47:43.860 --> 47:44.800]  that could happen, right?
[47:45.440 --> 47:47.860]  What would happen? Would it be like a 10
[47:47.860 --> 47:48.780]  times multiplier?
[47:49.480 --> 47:51.540]  Would it blow the Earth in half?
[47:51.960 --> 47:53.600]  So what would you be trying to do? You'd be trying to like
[47:53.600 --> 47:55.760]  nuke the literal fuel rods
[47:55.760 --> 47:57.180]  of the power plant.
[47:57.580 --> 47:59.940]  Yeah, the part where Homer drew the racing stripe.
[48:00.560 --> 48:00.720]  Yeah.
[48:03.420 --> 48:04.400]  What would happen?
[48:05.100 --> 48:07.700]  Something bad, right? Like something really
[48:07.700 --> 48:09.660]  fucking bad. I'm imagining it like a cluster
[48:09.660 --> 48:11.920]  grenade in Worms, where like the original one
[48:12.420 --> 48:13.780]  blows the rods out
[48:13.780 --> 48:15.720]  in multiple directions and then they all
[48:15.720 --> 48:17.300]  blow up. Yeah.
[48:17.800 --> 48:19.960]  I mean, because it's like a tremendous
[48:19.960 --> 48:21.120]  I mean, Chernobyl,
[48:21.680 --> 48:23.180]  the one in Japan, it's a
[48:23.180 --> 48:24.760]  it's a tremendous
[48:26.940 --> 48:27.700]  like catastrophically
[48:28.560 --> 48:28.940]  ecological
[48:29.660 --> 48:30.980]  disaster. I don't think they'd
[48:30.980 --> 48:33.120]  explode as rods though, do they?
[48:33.200 --> 48:35.120]  They're just hot. That's all you're doing in
[48:35.120 --> 48:37.100]  a nuclear power plant. You're just like boiling water.
[48:38.340 --> 48:38.760]  So I think it's two factors.
[48:38.760 --> 48:41.240]  What happens when you explode that
[48:42.540 --> 48:43.760]  with a nuclear bomb?
[48:44.440 --> 48:45.160]  I think it would just be
[48:45.160 --> 48:47.040]  super radiation. So I think the
[48:47.040 --> 48:49.120]  explosion, I don't know, like outside of the
[48:49.120 --> 48:51.460]  infrastructure, you have the bomb
[48:51.460 --> 48:53.480]  and whatever explodes as
[48:53.480 --> 48:55.500]  part of that infrastructure as the impact
[48:55.500 --> 48:57.720]  of it. And then I think on a radioactive
[48:57.720 --> 48:59.540]  level, it's just like super
[48:59.540 --> 49:01.540]  radioactive. Yeah, I think they would just
[49:01.540 --> 49:03.480]  create trails of death to wherever
[49:03.480 --> 49:05.260]  they landed from wherever they exploded.
[49:05.820 --> 49:07.460]  I mean, like do you think
[49:07.460 --> 49:09.480]  on an order of magnitude, do you think it would do
[49:09.480 --> 49:11.480]  like it would cover a larger area of
[49:11.480 --> 49:13.120]  destruction? It has to, right?
[49:14.200 --> 49:15.400]  It has to trigger
[49:15.400 --> 49:17.360]  it has to trigger some sort of an explosion
[49:17.360 --> 49:19.540]  that is different
[49:19.540 --> 49:21.460]  than if a power plant exploded
[49:21.460 --> 49:23.240]  or melted down. Chernobyl exploded.
[49:23.640 --> 49:24.840]  It did. Or
[49:25.700 --> 49:27.380]  some sort of explosion that's different
[49:27.380 --> 49:28.460]  when like
[49:28.460 --> 49:30.880]  you bomb a city
[49:31.600 --> 49:33.260]  or the desert or the ocean
[49:33.260 --> 49:34.780]  with a nuclear bomb.
[49:35.160 --> 49:37.300]  Like the combination of those two
[49:37.300 --> 49:39.260]  forces breaking down
[49:39.260 --> 49:40.800]  at the same time would have to
[49:40.800 --> 49:43.220]  it just feels like somebody
[49:43.220 --> 49:45.300]  should make, maybe there's
[49:45.300 --> 49:47.240]  a Tom Clancy book about it that I'm not
[49:47.240 --> 49:48.780]  aware of or something, but it just seems
[49:48.780 --> 49:51.380]  I don't know why nobody in my purview
[49:51.380 --> 49:52.800]  at least has ever
[49:53.920 --> 49:55.660]  explored that narratively. How do you think fallout started?
[49:55.880 --> 49:57.360]  Yeah right, like maybe that's what happens
[49:57.360 --> 49:59.440]  it creates deathclaws. Like that's the end result
[49:59.440 --> 50:01.220]  that's how you invent the deathclaw.
[50:01.700 --> 50:03.560]  It is an interesting question. I don't know
[50:03.560 --> 50:05.000]  for me it's a question of
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.640]  is the area around
[50:07.640 --> 50:09.200]  that site now
[50:09.200 --> 50:11.360]  more radioactive than if just one of
[50:11.360 --> 50:13.160]  the things happened by itself. I assume
[50:13.160 --> 50:15.360]  it's that. And it's not that the range is
[50:15.360 --> 50:17.440]  wider, but it's like a more
[50:17.440 --> 50:19.400]  radioactive area, if that makes sense.
[50:19.520 --> 50:21.340]  Yeah, but here's the problem. If it's
[50:21.340 --> 50:23.340]  more radioactive then it's the particles
[50:23.340 --> 50:25.100]  are in the atmosphere and in the air
[50:25.100 --> 50:27.580]  and then wind currents can take that increased
[50:27.580 --> 50:29.580]  radioactivity and spread it out
[50:29.580 --> 50:31.540]  further, right? I guess, yeah
[50:31.540 --> 50:33.300]  but I have no idea.
[50:33.580 --> 50:35.480]  All my points of reference I feel like are Chernobyl
[50:35.480 --> 50:37.380]  at this point. Like I'm thinking of
[50:37.380 --> 50:39.260]  I don't know if you've seen the pilot episode
[50:39.260 --> 50:41.280]  when they're like dancing and they think it's snow but
[50:41.280 --> 50:43.360]  it's radioactive ash and it's devastating
[50:43.360 --> 50:45.040]  Like I'm just imagining that
[50:45.040 --> 50:47.020]  but maybe a further distance
[50:47.020 --> 50:49.200]  than that? I don't know.
[50:49.280 --> 50:51.380]  It's an interesting question. It definitely feels
[50:51.380 --> 50:53.500]  like a plot of like
[50:53.500 --> 50:55.400]  maybe not a Michael Bay
[50:55.400 --> 50:57.680]  movie, but like Hot Shots. Like Hot Shots
[50:57.680 --> 50:59.320]  Part 3 is
[50:59.320 --> 51:01.400]  they're sending an atomic bomb
[51:01.400 --> 51:03.540]  at the nuclear power plant
[51:03.540 --> 51:05.640]  like it's so excessively damaging.
[51:05.880 --> 51:07.300]  Like it's something Dr. Evil
[51:07.300 --> 51:09.480]  would do. Yes, yeah, exactly.
[51:09.860 --> 51:11.260]  I'm pretty sure they tried to move a
[51:11.260 --> 51:12.920]  hurricane once with a nuke.
[51:13.080 --> 51:14.480]  It was discussed, right, as an option?
[51:14.720 --> 51:17.420]  They tried to kill that monster in Cloverfield with a nuke.
[51:17.860 --> 51:19.140]  Oh yeah? They did. That's how we lost
[51:19.140 --> 51:19.980]  Houston. Yeah.
[51:20.160 --> 51:26.680]  It didn't stop it.
[51:27.980 --> 51:29.200]  Also how we made Godzilla.
[51:29.980 --> 51:30.160]  Yeah.
[51:30.860 --> 51:33.520]  Maybe that's how you make Godzilla. Maybe that's what it is.
[51:37.060 --> 51:39.380]  Can I just go on record as saying I hope it doesn't
[51:39.380 --> 51:40.580]  happen? Okay.
[51:40.580 --> 51:41.520]  Yeah, me too.
[51:41.600 --> 51:43.520]  I'm against it happening.
[51:45.380 --> 51:46.420]  Here's the thing though.
[51:46.500 --> 51:48.580]  I was on record first. Here's the thing.
[51:48.780 --> 51:50.700]  And I haven't seen it. Maybe one of
[51:50.700 --> 51:52.540]  you have. You can fill me in. I also
[51:52.540 --> 51:54.600]  am initially against the idea of the nuke.
[51:54.860 --> 51:56.560]  But the nuke made
[51:56.560 --> 51:58.620]  Godzilla, right? So we got
[51:58.620 --> 52:00.520]  Godzilla. Then King Kong
[52:00.520 --> 52:02.260]  showed up and they fought.
[52:02.560 --> 52:04.580]  Was Godzilla on our side
[52:04.580 --> 52:06.580]  or was King Kong on our side?
[52:06.620 --> 52:08.660]  Because we might need the Godzilla to fight
[52:08.660 --> 52:10.800]  the King Kong. Well, they kept him around
[52:10.800 --> 52:11.620]  to fight, you know.
[52:12.400 --> 52:14.760]  Or were they just fighting each other and we were just kind
[52:14.760 --> 52:16.460]  of the victims of the like
[52:16.460 --> 52:18.760]  we lived in the area the fight happened in.
[52:19.040 --> 52:20.100]  Yeah. Well, I think like
[52:20.100 --> 52:22.740]  when you're talking King Ghidorah
[52:22.740 --> 52:24.800]  we like deployed Godzilla, right?
[52:25.240 --> 52:26.920]  To help out? Yeah.
[52:26.920 --> 52:29.020]  Yeah, we kind of steered him in that direction.
[52:29.960 --> 52:30.740]  So we might
[52:30.740 --> 52:32.960]  need Godzilla. So that...
[52:32.960 --> 52:33.800]  Here's a question.
[52:34.600 --> 52:36.800]  If Godzilla was created from radioactivity
[52:36.800 --> 52:38.440]  that's right. That's correct, right?
[52:38.980 --> 52:40.720]  Yeah, well at least in the Matthew Broderick movie.
[52:41.120 --> 52:42.840]  Wouldn't he himself be radioactive?
[52:43.300 --> 52:44.960]  Therefore anything he came in contact
[52:44.960 --> 52:46.680]  with would die slowly anyway
[52:46.680 --> 52:48.920]  much like people in Chernobyl. So wouldn't
[52:48.920 --> 52:50.320]  like King Kong get
[52:50.320 --> 52:52.380]  giant King Kong
[52:52.380 --> 52:54.740]  gorilla cancer six months later anyway?
[52:54.920 --> 52:56.140]  Even if it won the fight?
[52:56.560 --> 52:58.180]  Doesn't Godzilla by
[52:58.800 --> 53:00.700]  just by showing up and laying
[53:00.700 --> 53:01.780]  hands on anyone
[53:02.640 --> 53:04.340]  eventually win the long game?
[53:04.900 --> 53:06.360]  That's a great point.
[53:06.460 --> 53:08.640]  Well sometimes he starts glowing and actually
[53:10.000 --> 53:10.980]  melts down.
[53:11.360 --> 53:11.380]  That's true.
[53:11.820 --> 53:13.100]  He doesn't glow.
[53:15.600 --> 53:16.140]  Oh man.
[53:16.860 --> 53:18.320]  I hope there's a Godzilla expert
[53:18.320 --> 53:20.400]  in the comment leaver or regulation listener
[53:20.400 --> 53:21.980]  who's looking to upgrade to a comment leaver.
[53:22.460 --> 53:24.340]  Or maybe a nuclear physicist who wants to
[53:24.340 --> 53:26.200]  answer these important questions. I'd love to
[53:26.200 --> 53:28.420]  know the smart people
[53:28.420 --> 53:29.720]  science behind it.
[53:31.180 --> 53:32.140]  I think Hank
[53:32.140 --> 53:33.120]  Azaria might be dead.
[53:33.420 --> 53:35.820]  I'm just trying to process that loss. I thought he was okay.
[53:35.900 --> 53:37.700]  I thought he made it through that experience. But you're right.
[53:37.980 --> 53:39.780]  He's got super cancer off screen
[53:39.780 --> 53:40.500]  20 minutes later.
[53:42.320 --> 53:44.320]  The way you just say a person's
[53:44.320 --> 53:45.880]  name and then...
[53:46.700 --> 53:47.800]  I thought for a second
[53:47.800 --> 53:49.040]  Hank Azaria was dead.
[53:49.420 --> 53:51.300]  You're scaring the shit out of me.
[53:51.380 --> 53:53.700]  I like him so much.
[53:55.360 --> 53:56.320]  It's a great cast.
[53:56.440 --> 53:58.100]  Jon Renau. He was great.
[53:58.260 --> 53:59.100]  He's dead now.
[53:59.100 --> 54:00.440]  Matthew Broderick.
[54:00.520 --> 54:02.640]  He was great in that movie. He's dead now.
[54:02.760 --> 54:04.900]  I don't know the name of the blonde lady. Thank God.
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.960]  I think Bryan Cranston and
[54:06.960 --> 54:08.700]  Millie Bobby Brown are dead too then, right?
[54:09.100 --> 54:10.240]  I didn't see that one.
[54:10.780 --> 54:12.320]  That's on you. You did that.
[54:14.380 --> 54:14.780]  Alright.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  Bryan Cranston died anyway. The first 5 minutes of that movie
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  was a bait and switch. I forgot.
[54:18.700 --> 54:21.040]  Let's stop saying people's names and dead and cancelled
[54:21.040 --> 54:22.220]  and everything like that.
[54:22.760 --> 54:23.160]  Yeah.
[54:24.720 --> 54:26.880]  Also, didn't Arnold Schwarzenegger just do...
[54:26.880 --> 54:28.860]  Everyone was in the comments saying how he was
[54:28.860 --> 54:30.780]  really amazing recently.
[54:30.940 --> 54:32.120]  Yeah. He's wonderful.
[54:32.660 --> 54:33.580]  I love Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[54:34.420 --> 54:36.920]  He's not dead because he didn't fight Godzilla.
[54:37.820 --> 54:38.140]  That's true.
[54:38.400 --> 54:40.360]  To my knowledge, he has not come within
[54:40.860 --> 54:42.040]  radioactive range of Godzilla.
[54:42.200 --> 54:45.080]  The Predator feels like they should be radioactive though, right?
[54:45.200 --> 54:46.900]  Like that blast in there feels
[54:46.900 --> 54:47.700]  like there would be
[54:47.700 --> 54:50.800]  something that came out of that Predator fight.
[54:51.460 --> 54:53.060]  Because of what?
[54:53.180 --> 54:54.340]  Because of their cloaking ability?
[54:54.340 --> 54:56.080]  Yeah, the bomb and like the tech
[54:56.080 --> 54:57.880]  and I don't trust that.
[54:57.980 --> 55:00.400]  I feel like that would be radioactive in some sense.
[55:00.940 --> 55:02.440]  The detonation, the explosion,
[55:02.540 --> 55:03.120]  all that.
[55:03.440 --> 55:06.520]  There also are probably creatures out there that thrive on radioactivity.
[55:08.620 --> 55:10.040]  Isn't that really
[55:10.580 --> 55:12.560]  what the Fantastic Four are?
[55:13.000 --> 55:13.980]  Right? Isn't that what the Incredible Hulk is?
[55:13.980 --> 55:14.400]  That's true.
[55:16.540 --> 55:17.740]  Biproducts of radioactivity.
[55:18.900 --> 55:19.460]  What do you mean?
[55:19.480 --> 55:22.140]  That's just you. You're in the carbon dioxide room.
[55:22.140 --> 55:24.080]  That's true.
[55:24.540 --> 55:25.300]  Are the cats alive?
[55:26.580 --> 55:28.080]  They're looking pretty sleepy.
[55:28.660 --> 55:29.880]  Canary in a coal mine.
[55:30.460 --> 55:32.100]  Can I pivot to the
[55:32.100 --> 55:33.800]  greatest text I've ever received from anybody?
[55:34.240 --> 55:34.800]  Oh yeah, sure.
[55:36.020 --> 55:37.420]  Geoff texted me.
[55:37.760 --> 55:39.600]  Oh, thank you for the honor.
[55:39.820 --> 55:40.920]  I'm the greatest text you've ever received.
[55:41.140 --> 55:44.140]  It's the most excited I've ever been receiving any text message ever.
[55:44.440 --> 55:45.160]  No context.
[55:45.920 --> 55:46.940]  Thursday, 9-12 PM.
[55:47.500 --> 55:49.880]  How much room do you have in your life for a mystery?
[55:52.140 --> 55:52.700]  Is this a setup?
[55:54.020 --> 55:55.300]  Geoff, do you want to talk about your mystery?
[55:56.980 --> 55:58.080]  I said I got acres.
[55:58.200 --> 55:59.540]  I'm ready. Let's talk about this mystery.
[55:59.680 --> 56:02.200]  Yeah, let me see. Let me catch up, because I'm going to need the
[56:02.700 --> 56:04.260]  timeline to make sense of this
[56:04.260 --> 56:05.280]  story. It was a lot.
[56:06.200 --> 56:06.520]  It was.
[56:07.820 --> 56:09.340]  So, to put it in
[56:10.080 --> 56:10.840]  point of clarity.
[56:12.320 --> 56:13.440]  We took a week off.
[56:13.940 --> 56:15.240]  Did we record last week or not?
[56:15.500 --> 56:16.060]  Yes, we did.
[56:17.340 --> 56:19.000]  Right after we recorded last week.
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.660]  This is a Sloppy Joes related story.
[56:20.780 --> 56:22.440]  Right after we recorded last week.
[56:22.680 --> 56:24.820]  And I told you guys all about Sloppy Joes
[56:24.820 --> 56:26.860]  and my game, the bingo,
[56:27.100 --> 56:28.300]  Sloppy Bingo that I invented.
[56:28.700 --> 56:30.860]  And I've decided that I'm living in my
[56:30.860 --> 56:32.640]  Slop era now. I have since. I have
[56:32.640 --> 56:34.900]  eaten Sloppy Joes since that recording
[56:34.900 --> 56:36.820]  again. Although
[56:36.820 --> 56:37.860]  I got to be honest with you.
[56:38.440 --> 56:40.660]  As much as I'm really digging the Sloppy Joes,
[56:41.540 --> 56:42.500]  four separate
[56:42.500 --> 56:44.600]  instances of Sloppy Joes in less than two weeks
[56:44.600 --> 56:46.380]  is maybe my limit.
[56:46.380 --> 56:48.360]  That's a lot. I may need to
[56:48.360 --> 56:50.440]  step back on Sloppy Joes just a tad.
[56:50.860 --> 56:52.300]  Yeah, before it becomes an S word.
[56:52.780 --> 56:54.540]  Yeah, I'm still living that Slop life
[56:54.540 --> 56:56.360]  though. I'm deep
[56:56.360 --> 56:58.260]  in my Slop era. I got
[56:58.260 --> 57:00.420]  two recliners. I'm wearing pajamas
[57:00.420 --> 57:01.860]  right now. I'm never
[57:02.780 --> 57:03.780]  resurfacing from that
[57:04.260 --> 57:05.500]  for sure. Anyway,
[57:06.840 --> 57:08.480]  immediately after we
[57:08.480 --> 57:10.460]  recorded and you guys were so
[57:10.460 --> 57:12.460]  kind about my idea and I was so fucking
[57:12.460 --> 57:13.820]  excited about doing it because
[57:13.820 --> 57:15.640]  and we haven't done it yet
[57:15.640 --> 57:17.920]  because we had to get through whatever else
[57:17.920 --> 57:18.960]  Condorman and a bunch of other stuff.
[57:19.960 --> 57:21.840]  I go to check in on
[57:21.840 --> 57:23.620]  my Slops. See how my
[57:23.620 --> 57:25.800]  Key Westers are doing. And for the
[57:25.800 --> 57:26.520]  first time
[57:28.460 --> 57:29.580]  since the
[57:29.580 --> 57:31.100]  entirety of my saga
[57:32.580 --> 57:33.960]  the cam was down.
[57:35.000 --> 57:35.560]  Ooh.
[57:35.940 --> 57:37.000]  And I thought
[57:38.940 --> 57:40.060]  what the fuck?
[57:40.340 --> 57:40.760]  Right? Like
[57:40.760 --> 57:42.760]  what is going
[57:42.760 --> 57:44.820]  on? And so
[57:44.820 --> 57:46.860]  I checked their inside camera and it
[57:46.860 --> 57:48.740]  was down too. Those are the two cameras that they have.
[57:49.520 --> 57:50.800]  And this camera has
[57:50.800 --> 57:52.580]  been up for like four months straight.
[57:52.780 --> 57:54.860]  And it died and I'm like holy shit
[57:54.860 --> 57:56.020]  what's going on? It's just like a
[57:56.540 --> 57:58.760]  dead screen. It shows it's
[57:58.760 --> 58:00.820]  up but it's not projecting any kind of screen.
[58:01.760 --> 58:02.740]  But the cool thing
[58:02.740 --> 58:04.400]  about the cameras on YouTube
[58:04.400 --> 58:06.660]  is that you can rewind them up to 24
[58:06.660 --> 58:08.100]  hours because it just
[58:08.100 --> 58:10.140]  it caches 24 hours. So I was able
[58:10.140 --> 58:12.400]  to go back and see it when it went down.
[58:12.920 --> 58:14.140]  And so I watched it
[58:14.140 --> 58:15.680]  and it died. I've written all this down.
[58:15.900 --> 58:18.120]  It died at 8.58am. It just
[58:18.120 --> 58:20.040]  like went black. And so I watched
[58:20.040 --> 58:21.860]  the footage a bunch of times, like four or five times
[58:21.860 --> 58:23.680]  and I couldn't really see anything
[58:24.260 --> 58:26.300]  that looked like it precipitated
[58:26.300 --> 58:28.080]  it going down. It probably like their internet went
[58:28.080 --> 58:28.560]  down or something.
[58:30.680 --> 58:31.480]  And so
[58:32.200 --> 58:34.120]  at this point it's like maybe 7pm
[58:34.120 --> 58:36.060]  or so because we had recorded the face and
[58:36.060 --> 58:38.080]  Emily was coming home and we stopped for dinner or whatever.
[58:38.600 --> 58:39.960]  And I'm talking about it with her
[58:39.960 --> 58:41.800]  and she's like, well let's go back and watch the footage again.
[58:41.880 --> 58:44.340]  And we go back and we look at it again and it's still down.
[58:44.440 --> 58:45.860]  Well first off, it's still down after dinner
[58:45.860 --> 58:48.020]  and a couple hours. And so it's
[58:49.180 --> 58:50.180]  still fucking down.
[58:50.320 --> 58:52.180]  So it's been down now for like four hours straight
[58:52.180 --> 58:53.400]  or something and I'm starting to get worried.
[58:54.500 --> 58:55.140]  And so
[58:56.260 --> 58:57.380]  Emily, we like
[58:57.700 --> 58:59.960]  we decided to call the bar. Just to see.
[59:00.380 --> 59:02.000]  To tell them that their webcam
[59:02.000 --> 59:03.440]  is down. That's where we are.
[59:03.440 --> 59:05.520]  So Emily calls and leaves them a
[59:05.520 --> 59:07.620]  message because you can't get through to them directly.
[59:07.760 --> 59:09.460]  We called like three different times. And she leaves them
[59:09.460 --> 59:10.400]  my number of course.
[59:11.460 --> 59:13.640]  And she's like, I just want to make sure y'all are okay
[59:13.640 --> 59:15.040]  and let you know your webcam's down.
[59:15.260 --> 59:15.940]  Please be safe.
[59:17.100 --> 59:19.420]  And then we were laughing about that for like a half hour.
[59:19.520 --> 59:20.720]  I think I even filmed her calling it.
[59:21.320 --> 59:23.480]  And then a little bit later we're like
[59:23.480 --> 59:25.440]  you know it's run by a different agency.
[59:25.440 --> 59:27.500]  It's run by a marketing department. So we go
[59:27.500 --> 59:29.460]  and we find out who's running the camera
[59:29.460 --> 59:31.020]  and we look that company up
[59:31.020 --> 59:33.220]  and then we call that company. We left them a message
[59:33.220 --> 59:35.300]  too. By this point it's like 9.30 at night.
[59:35.400 --> 59:36.780]  So I'm not expecting anybody to be there
[59:36.780 --> 59:39.120]  at this digital marketing company
[59:39.120 --> 59:40.420]  at 9.30 at night on a Thursday.
[59:41.400 --> 59:43.220]  But you know, they'll get in at 8 o'clock
[59:43.220 --> 59:44.840]  in the morning and maybe they'll reset the webcam
[59:44.840 --> 59:46.840]  or something. And by the way
[59:47.520 --> 59:49.040]  I'd like to point out, nobody returned my
[59:49.040 --> 59:51.140]  calls. Neither person
[59:51.140 --> 59:51.800]  returned our calls.
[59:52.160 --> 59:54.780]  I don't want to talk to someone who has that much free time.
[59:54.940 --> 59:56.120]  I was a little disappointed.
[59:57.540 --> 59:58.620]  But we were just being silly.
[59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.940]  So then she was like, well let's look at the camera
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:01.880]  and just see what happens.
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.680]  Let's take a look one more time. And as we look at it
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.840]  this next time, I notice like two cop cars
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.720]  pull up. No big deal.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:09.920]  Like in the background.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.460]  And then they get out and three cops start
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:14.620]  walking around the facility. And then they disappear
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.640]  off camera for a bit and then they come back and they disappear
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.640]  again. And then it just cuts. Then they get in their
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.360]  car and they drive away and it cuts dead
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.920]  as soon as they
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.120]  drive away.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:26.780]  And I'm like, ah, fuck. That's really weird.
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.720]  I wish I had more data or something.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.000]  And then it hit me. I could probably
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.900]  rewind the inside camera to when
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:34.920]  that one went dead. And so I jumped over
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.000]  and I did that. And three minutes before
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.080]  it blinks off, there were the fucking cops.
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.860]  They were inside the bar walking
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:42.660]  around with like bulletproof
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:45.000]  vests on and shit. Conspiracy.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.340]  Conspiracy, right?
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.820]  And they're like having conversations and shit with the
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.680]  employees. And it's all being live
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.900]  broadcast. It's all being live. Oh, by the way.
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:53.920]  I forgot my lines.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.760]  It's okay. You did great.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.560]  You did great. We pulled that off.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.380]  You did it. It was great.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.660]  Did I say it twice?
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.200]  Ah, shit.
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.900]  It was flawless. Conspiracy!
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.340]  It still has a pat on the back.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.220]  You guys did so good.
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.660]  We did that. We nailed it.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.000]  Audience, if you're
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.640]  not familiar with what's going on here,
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.800]  we teased a couple times this
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.960]  idea I had of wanting to promo
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.260]  a story at an exciting
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.160]  moment from the middle of the podcast,
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.160]  but at the beginning, kind of like people
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.240]  do, instead of a cold open
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.160]  to kind of be a teaser to come in, but we
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.900]  wanted to record it linearly.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.020]  And so I wrote that
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.140]  one little bit down. We recorded that
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:39.980]  at the beginning. Just went straight
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.500]  into the entire episode.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.020]  Andrew teed us up to get to here, and then
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:46.200]  we went back in. And then, Gavin, you nailed it with your lines.
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.980]  I think everybody should
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.100]  go to bed proud of themselves tonight. We really pulled
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.500]  that off. We definitely all tried.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.700]  I'm going to go to bed proud. Could
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:56.180]  please, Nick or Kelly, could you please just edit
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.060]  out both those moments so I
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:00.020]  can hear them? I want to hear how
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.060]  close that is. It's probably not close at all.
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.920]  We're probably so far off.
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.880]  I was not close. I had nothing written. I didn't know
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.780]  when I said the word.
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:08.740]  I panicked.
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:11.140]  Anyway,
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:14.000]  I feel it's a bit
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  weird because you're watching these cops walk around
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.980]  this bar, but it's also being live
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.060]  broadcast on YouTube, so anybody can watch it.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:21.920]  You can just hear people
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.080]  talking. Nothing crazy. The cops
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.840]  leave. I swear you can hear a female
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.640]  employee go like,
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.140]  Jesus Christ!
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:30.780]  Like a sigh of relief.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:32.780]  And then it cuts dead.
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.060]  And then,
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.780]  let me see what else are in my notes because this was a while ago
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:38.400]  at this point.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.640]  We go to the website.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.700]  On the website, they have access to
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.820]  two more cameras. Those are both
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.660]  shut down as well. Andrew goes
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:48.000]  through.
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:51.680]  Andrew's now involved in this. He goes
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.500]  and he finds all the screenshots
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.680]  that the webcams have taken, and we find out
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.680]  it all lines up with it shutting down at this exact
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.400]  same time.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.360]  I'm looking at like, it goes
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.600]  deeper. We look at like the arrest
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.540]  reports to see if there were any crimes reported
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:07.940]  in the area. There was actually
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:09.040]  somebody arrested.
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.460]  You could hear it actually at a point the night
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.360]  before the person getting arrested off
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.420]  camera and being read their Miranda
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.520]  rights and shit. You don't ever see it, but you can hear it.
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:19.400]  It's fucking wild, the stuff that
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.360]  you can find just looking at a public webcam.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.280]  Anyway, and then
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.420]  so, we get to that
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:27.600]  point. I'm explaining this to Gavin.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.240]  I ask Gavin,
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.320]  Andrew says, hey,
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:32.940]  we should probably, before these,
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.360]  because we're deep into this mystery. This is
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.980]  like one in the morning now. You guys are both involved.
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:37.860]  And
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.360]  at this point, Andrew has
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.460]  the brilliant idea, we should download these videos
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:45.080]  so that we have a record of them
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.420]  if we get embroiled
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.120]  in some sort of
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:51.340]  government conspiracy where we
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:53.360]  have to run for our lives and expose the truth
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.960]  to the New York Times while
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.280]  rogue CIA agents are chasing
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.180]  us across the country trying to assassinate us
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.300]  because we have the information that can save the
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.980]  future of democracy or whatever.
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:04.220]  I'm assuming, right?
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:06.440]  And so,
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:09.200]  Gavin tries to figure, but you can't download the videos.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.060]  It won't let you.
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:13.240]  It's still on, it's still broadcasting, so I don't
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.120]  think there's necessarily a file that's
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:15.740]  finished yet.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.100]  But the 24 hours is eroding
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.160]  as we go, so we're trying to get to there before we start
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.160]  to lose the pertinent data. So, Gavin,
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.240]  you came up with some master plan where you
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.920]  set up iPads to
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.480]  screen record.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.860]  I set up one iPad for each camera
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:33.260]  and then I turned off the auto lock
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:35.200]  and I just rewound them as far back
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.020]  as they went and just started
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.300]  to screen recording on them.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.480]  Because I couldn't figure out how to capture from my
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:42.680]  Mac with sound. I just couldn't figure it out.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:43.880]  I'm too dumb.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.260]  Well, I mean, that's a pretty good setup.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.220]  I wouldn't say I was dumb.
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:51.020]  At this point, it's like 3 in the morning and I'm exhausted.
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.460]  I've been CSI, private investigator,
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.020]  three investigators,
[01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:56.900]  I've been Matt Houston,
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.160]  I've been MacGyver,
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.160]  I've been Jim Rockford,
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.040]  I was Magnum PI,
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:04.820]  all rolled into one.
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.180]  I was Hardcastle and McCormick,
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.880]  I was the Scarecrow and Mrs. King,
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.920]  I was Simon and Simon,
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.120]  I was every
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:14.820]  fucking private investigator
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:16.600]  I ever grew up watching when I was a kid.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.300]  Those were all TV shows, by the way,
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.280]  that I watched when I was a kid.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.020]  And go to bed, wake up,
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:24.260]  and the first thing Emily and I do when we wake up in the morning
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.380]  is like, oh fuck, let's turn on and see if it's still down.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:27.900]  And it was just up. It was fine.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.820]  And so we rewound it to when it came back on.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:32.480]  It came back on almost 24 hours later and the first thing you see
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.120]  is a repair truck in front of it.
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:35.760]  You can hear a guy on a ladder fixing it.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.400]  It was such a great conspiracy
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.960]  with the cops and everything.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.040]  I don't know if you mentioned it, but there was a moment
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.520]  where once the cops left on the inside
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.580]  you thought you heard somebody say
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.480]  like, fuck, I'm glad that's over
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.280]  type thing. Like it was, oh,
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.480]  there's all this intrigue and it was just that
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.640]  the camera was broken.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.640]  I was partly intrigued when I was setting up these recordings,
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:58.460]  but I also was really concerned
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.920]  that I was somehow going to end up a witness.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.280]  I didn't want to end up in
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.540]  the inconvenience of court
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:05.320]  because I have this footage
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.760]  just in case I saw something.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.160]  I'm telling you,
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.300]  we were going to be embroiled in,
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:14.360]  we were going to have to
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:15.280]  steal a car and we're
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:17.660]  racing to New York to turn the tapes over
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:19.920]  to the only person we can
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.020]  trust, this journalist that we know we can trust.
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:23.840]  And meanwhile, Bill Burr
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.820]  is playing a rogue CIA agent
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:28.000]  who knows
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.980]  we caught him on the take and he's chasing
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:32.040]  after us with like, it's like Michael Pena
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.820]  and him and some other
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:36.120]  and the lady
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.580]  who was on
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.300]  like Wendy McCovey
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:44.220]  from Reno 911 and they're racing us
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:46.160]  across the country trying to stop us before we turn
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.100]  the tapes in. But now, we don't have to worry
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.400]  about that. Why Bill Burr?
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.080]  He's a good actor and he plays serious really
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.680]  well. I was thinking about Breaking Bad.
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:55.900]  I think he should reboot Columbo.
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.620]  Bill Burr?
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:06:59.940]  Bill Burr as
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:02.220]  Columbo would be great. That's a great
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:03.860]  idea. If he was just
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:05.440]  the new Columbo but he did it
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.880]  like totally as Bill Burr like in his
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:09.240]  style. You know
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:10.560]  you know
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.480]  you know uh
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.700]  fucking Liam Neeson is rebooting
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.740]  um uh Police Cops.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.200]  What's it called?
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.860]  Police Cops? Yeah, that's what the TV
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:22.560]  show was called.
[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:24.420]  Naked Gun.
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:25.400]  Police Squad.
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:26.940]  That's it, yeah.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.360]  Liam Neeson is rebooting
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.420]  that. Are they gonna then go
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:33.520]  and make more Naked Gun?
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.040]  Yeah, he's gonna play
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.500]  Drummond in Naked Gun. Is OJ gonna be in it again?
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.300]  I don't know if OJ is gonna be in it.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.480]  Police Cops is from The Simpsons. You're right, Nick.
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:42.740]  Thanks.
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.580]  Police Squad is what I was thinking of.
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:50.980]  Oh, man.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:51.580]  Anyway,
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.000]  that's
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.200]  what I got going on.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.540]  I might have a new mystery for
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.500]  next week. Oh, maybe it'll be in the
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.400]  preview of next week.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.700]  Oh, you know what?
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:05.440]  Maybe everybody should get a shot at a preview.
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.460]  Kind of like we did. Everybody got to pick a movie
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.440]  and we had the little movie trilogy. Maybe we have a preview
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:10.960]  trilogy. Because you had one
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:12.760]  ready last week that we didn't do, Gav.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:15.460]  Yeah, mine was gonna be me screaming in the middle of
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:16.980]  the argument about how the
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.420]  shopping challenge went wrong.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.120]  Oh.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:23.520]  I think you got
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.440]  yelled at by Eric on
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.880]  Condorman, right? How about that?
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.460]  No, that was in the recording. It was in the recording.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.500]  Yeah. It was the third time I'd
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:32.420]  been yelled at about it.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:33.800]  Yes.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.040]  I think actually
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.400]  is it the third or fourth time because there was
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.320]  a yelling that wasn't on recording
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.400]  with him and then it just happened again
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.300]  on the recording.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.380]  Impressively. Yeah, well, he yelled at me in person
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:49.080]  at Geoff's house when we were doing pieces.
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:50.680]  Yeah.
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.540]  That was great. This was a fun episode.
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:55.480]  I'm hopeful I can bring another
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:57.420]  I'm not gonna claim it's nearly as good
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:59.300]  of a mystery, but I've stumbled into
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.380]  something that I meant to take some screenshots
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:02.840]  of that I forgot.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.020]  I'll be ready next week. I'm intrigued.
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.460]  I'm really looking forward to a mystery.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.360]  And if you know the answer to the
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:11.380]  mystery of what happens if you nuke a nuclear
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:12.600]  facility, let us know.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.440]  We also don't want it to
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.420]  happen, but we would like to know what would happen.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.500]  Well, okay. We're against the
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.060]  facility being nuked, but
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:23.400]  it's, you know, Godzilla...
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.060]  I'm against nuclear weapons.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.460]  Except in instances of
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:29.920]  Godzilla, I'm
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.700]  pro-nuclear
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.580]  everything in terms of Godzilla.
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.620]  Well, as long as we have an oxygen destroyer
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.140]  we can take out Godzilla, right?
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:39.480]  Oh.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:41.400]  Shit. I guess that's true.
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:42.580]  Do we have one of those?
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.540]  Not yet.
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:46.900]  Is that a
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.520]  flame? Isn't a flame an oxygen
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.160]  destroyer? Does it just fire?
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.580]  It'd probably take care of a candle
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:53.080]  pretty well.
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:10:02.640]  Oh, man. That's the
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.440]  kind of callback you can expect on the
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.640]  F***ing Face Podcast. Thanks for listening to
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.740]  another episode. Boy, we loved having you.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.560]  It's like you were sitting there
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.460]  right along with us. Boy,
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.500]  did we appreciate it. Why don't you go ahead and
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.520]  tell a friend or a co-worker or an enemy
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.540]  or a stranger. Write a
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:20.460]  letter to... pick... here's what you do.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.380]  Here's what you do. Here's what I want
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.620]  everybody to do that's listening to F***ing Face right now.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.020]  Well, first off, it'd be really
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.100]  swell if you went and
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:30.540]  subscribed to our YouTube channel and watched all the content we
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:32.020]  put out on there or on the Rooster Teeth app.
[01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:34.100]  Both are totally valid places to go.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.500]  You pick. We try to
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.560]  give you as many options as possible. But then I'd like you to
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.540]  go potentially
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:42.640]  to where you could buy
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.640]  a phone book. I don't know where that
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.620]  is. I guess you don't
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.220]  buy them, but you get one. Maybe you go to
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:50.500]  a bank and ask them if they have a phone book
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.620]  you can borrow. They used to just mail them to you.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.580]  And I haven't seen one in probably 30 years.
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.380]  If you can find one,
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.560]  maybe an antique one. Go to
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.580]  a yard sale or an estate sale if you see an old
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.640]  phone book. It doesn't have to be current. You just need
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.540]  an address. You go in there, you find an
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.240]  address of one of your neighbors in your town.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:08.200]  Send them a letter that says, hey, I want you to
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.260]  check out this new podcast. I think you might enjoy it.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.100]  And yeah, we'd appreciate that.
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.420]  And also give us some stars.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.040]  Bye!
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.060]  Andrew does not eat the pencil. All that
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.060]  and more on next week's episode of
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:40.660]  F*** Face.
