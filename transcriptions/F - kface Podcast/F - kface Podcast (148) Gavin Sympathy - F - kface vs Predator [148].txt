[00:00.000 --> 00:01.180]  You ever wonder why we're here?
[00:19.100 --> 00:20.920]  Because we're not a baseball podcast, right?
[00:21.040 --> 00:23.480]  We're a baseball adjacent podcast.
[00:23.640 --> 00:25.300]  In the way that Andrew likes baseball culture,
[00:25.400 --> 00:26.720]  that is the way that we're a baseball podcast.
[00:27.240 --> 00:27.780]  100 percent.
[00:28.400 --> 00:29.880]  Yeah. Gavin was early, by the way.
[00:30.400 --> 00:30.760]  148.
[00:31.420 --> 00:32.000]  What do you mean?
[00:32.400 --> 00:34.560]  I heard I heard you enter.
[00:34.760 --> 00:35.500]  I looked at the time.
[00:35.760 --> 00:36.680]  259. But go ahead.
[00:36.780 --> 00:37.460]  Episode 148.
[00:37.860 --> 00:39.200]  Oh, wait, no, no, no.
[00:39.200 --> 00:39.980]  Wait a second. Wait a second.
[00:40.040 --> 00:43.700]  You heard it and then you looked up and you saw the time was one minute early
[00:43.700 --> 00:46.300]  or you heard it and then it flipped when you.
[00:46.360 --> 00:47.640]  No, no, I heard it.
[00:48.020 --> 00:48.840]  I looked down.
[00:49.020 --> 00:50.040]  It said two fifty nine.
[00:50.120 --> 00:52.400]  And then two seconds later, it flipped to three o'clock.
[00:52.720 --> 00:54.500]  I don't know. It's episode 148.
[00:54.680 --> 00:56.820]  It's physically impossible for me to be early.
[00:56.940 --> 00:58.320]  I clicked at three.
[00:58.720 --> 01:00.940]  And that is based on the world's time.
[01:01.940 --> 01:04.920]  I think if you threw a challenge flag down, Gavin, you might be in the right here.
[01:05.040 --> 01:06.780]  It would be a challengeable play, in my opinion.
[01:07.080 --> 01:07.980]  It would be worth reviewing.
[01:08.460 --> 01:10.120]  I would say that to you.
[01:10.360 --> 01:11.900]  Review it. How do we review it?
[01:11.900 --> 01:15.200]  No, we can't review it, but I'm saying if it was like a football game
[01:15.200 --> 01:18.200]  and he could throw a challenge flag and we did review it,
[01:18.600 --> 01:20.360]  I think he would be in the right.
[01:20.520 --> 01:22.180]  Nick is saying there's evidence in Craig.
[01:22.340 --> 01:23.140]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:23.360 --> 01:24.600]  I, you know, he could be right.
[01:25.300 --> 01:27.800]  If he started at two fifty eight, it is what it is.
[01:27.900 --> 01:30.320]  I'm just saying when he joined, it was it's.
[01:31.300 --> 01:31.760]  It is what it is.
[01:31.760 --> 01:34.560]  I think those are such dumb rules like the delay a game.
[01:35.180 --> 01:36.620]  Oh, shit.
[01:37.240 --> 01:38.540]  Challenge flag worked.
[01:38.540 --> 01:40.140]  Nick weighs in.
[01:40.460 --> 01:43.080]  I joined two seconds after two.
[01:44.360 --> 01:46.500]  Wait, two minutes after two fifty eight.
[01:46.580 --> 01:47.060]  Is that what they're saying?
[01:47.800 --> 01:51.200]  Yeah, it's saying you it's saying you joined at three minutes
[01:51.200 --> 01:54.740]  and zero three and five tenths of a second or something.
[01:55.140 --> 01:59.700]  So I joined at three o'clock and point oh three seconds.
[02:01.160 --> 02:01.980]  Do we all agree on that?
[02:02.120 --> 02:03.560]  Point oh three seconds.
[02:04.260 --> 02:05.720]  I've agreed this entire way.
[02:06.100 --> 02:07.540]  Oh, no, that is second. Wait, what?
[02:07.540 --> 02:10.380]  Oh, you're losing yourself.
[02:10.500 --> 02:11.480]  You're right, Gavin. You're fine.
[02:11.600 --> 02:13.740]  Just don't be so specific. You won. Just continue.
[02:14.160 --> 02:14.880]  You're going to make it worse.
[02:15.040 --> 02:16.240]  You went one step too far.
[02:16.640 --> 02:19.360]  You were three o'clock and five five one hundredths of a second.
[02:19.660 --> 02:20.900]  I think. What?
[02:22.320 --> 02:24.260]  Well, OK, so five seconds.
[02:25.220 --> 02:26.260]  Yeah. Eric, how do you feel?
[02:26.820 --> 02:28.540]  I mean, you're wrong, but it's fine. It doesn't matter.
[02:29.220 --> 02:30.460]  Maybe I'm wrong. What do you mean?
[02:30.520 --> 02:32.360]  I watched it happen. I'm just letting you know what happened.
[02:32.900 --> 02:34.280]  He's just giving you. You watched it where?
[02:35.040 --> 02:36.020]  On my computer.
[02:36.400 --> 02:38.440]  And this is a work computer, so it can't be wrong.
[02:39.300 --> 02:42.160]  I will say, I mean, how do we know Craig's not wrong?
[02:42.460 --> 02:43.660]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:44.020 --> 02:46.340]  I don't trust his little bear face.
[02:46.520 --> 02:47.340]  That's that's it.
[02:49.460 --> 02:51.920]  Oh, man, the audience is going to be mad because they don't like it
[02:51.920 --> 02:53.100]  when we make too much fun of Gavin.
[02:53.540 --> 02:55.840]  I don't think we're making fun of Gavin at all.
[02:55.840 --> 02:58.660]  Isn't that what's isn't that what's made my living over the last 10 years?
[02:59.260 --> 03:00.100]  I've been saying that.
[03:00.300 --> 03:02.640]  I've been reading comments saying we've been going too hard on Gavin lately
[03:02.640 --> 03:04.180]  with the feet stuff and the other stuff.
[03:04.180 --> 03:05.540]  So it's not funny anymore.
[03:05.620 --> 03:07.300]  Yeah, we've been going too hard.
[03:07.440 --> 03:10.260]  It's clear we're clearly serious and taking out some real frustrations.
[03:10.380 --> 03:15.660]  I remember in in Minecraft, I had to and I and I really appreciate the audience
[03:15.660 --> 03:19.520]  for having my back a lot of the time, but I had to go hard
[03:19.520 --> 03:23.940]  asshole for a while because I was getting sympathy for stuff that I didn't deserve.
[03:24.480 --> 03:26.620]  Like the audience was very defensive of me, for example.
[03:26.840 --> 03:30.760]  You remember when I built that little trophy room in a in a let's build
[03:30.760 --> 03:33.440]  and then I was hoping people would find it and make fun of me for it.
[03:33.440 --> 03:34.680]  I was just doing it as like a dumb bit.
[03:35.220 --> 03:35.320]  Yeah.
[03:35.740 --> 03:38.780]  But I think a lot of the audience thought that that was like my little shrine
[03:38.780 --> 03:41.080]  to my wins and I really, I really liked it.
[03:41.320 --> 03:45.120]  And I was genuinely sad when everyone found it and made fun of it.
[03:45.200 --> 03:47.680]  But I really just built it so it could be found.
[03:47.820 --> 03:49.480]  I built it as like a laughable thing.
[03:51.180 --> 03:54.380]  Yeah, everyone was really slaying everyone else.
[03:54.500 --> 03:57.700]  I was like, no, no, don't worry, it's exactly what I intended.
[03:57.840 --> 04:00.180]  And then I just had to be like more of a prick to people in videos
[04:00.180 --> 04:02.040]  so people would feel less sorry for me.
[04:02.660 --> 04:06.740]  I think with the exception of the indignity that I suffered
[04:06.740 --> 04:11.280]  in the tater tot fiasco, everything ever said has been comedy
[04:11.280 --> 04:14.120]  and for fun in the history of this podcast.
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.060]  We have to please. We do.
[04:17.400 --> 04:20.180]  Can I ask a random random question I've been thinking about?
[04:20.700 --> 04:22.440]  Yeah. Real fast before you do that.
[04:22.720 --> 04:25.660]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[04:25.860 --> 04:29.300]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and I believe you're listening to the one hundred
[04:29.300 --> 04:32.520]  and forty eighth episode of this podcast.
[04:32.640 --> 04:35.080]  It has been a F*** Face-y day
[04:36.540 --> 04:37.920]  from start to finish.
[04:38.640 --> 04:40.180]  How about what's your question, Andrew?
[04:40.480 --> 04:43.400]  Is there a food that tastes better with air in it than corn?
[04:43.600 --> 04:46.460]  I think corn might be the number one air food.
[04:47.120 --> 04:48.720]  What did you just say? Oh, OK.
[04:48.780 --> 04:52.660]  So think about like the Cheeto puff and the Cheeto crunch.
[04:53.200 --> 04:56.720]  The difference between the products is air, from what I can tell.
[04:57.260 --> 04:57.780]  It's airy.
[04:57.780 --> 04:59.440]  They try to do the same with potatoes.
[04:59.600 --> 05:01.100]  There's like the potato chip popables.
[05:01.300 --> 05:02.460]  I think those suck.
[05:02.580 --> 05:03.920]  I just don't think those are good.
[05:04.060 --> 05:06.580]  I think air inflates corn.
[05:06.840 --> 05:09.840]  And I can't think of any other food that is enhanced by air.
[05:11.580 --> 05:15.060]  Eric hit a heavy hitter in the in the text chat.
[05:15.660 --> 05:17.640]  Cotton candy. Is that an air?
[05:17.640 --> 05:18.440]  Yeah, it is. It is.
[05:18.600 --> 05:19.740]  Yeah, I'm not going to argue that.
[05:19.900 --> 05:21.420]  That is very air into it.
[05:21.720 --> 05:23.480]  But but there's no. What do you mean?
[05:23.860 --> 05:26.560]  I mean, it's just like strings of sugar, right?
[05:26.560 --> 05:28.520]  There's no there's no like air in the sugar.
[05:28.660 --> 05:30.000]  It's just spaced out sugar.
[05:30.640 --> 05:33.000]  Oh, this is a here's here's here's the difference.
[05:33.140 --> 05:35.400]  Here's the thing, Gavin.
[05:35.540 --> 05:36.120]  What do you call?
[05:36.260 --> 05:37.700]  What do you call cotton candy?
[05:38.340 --> 05:38.900]  Candy floss.
[05:39.200 --> 05:40.980]  Yeah, that's that's I think why.
[05:41.200 --> 05:42.940]  OK, I think that's why there's a miss.
[05:43.020 --> 05:44.840]  I think that's why there's a miscommunication here.
[05:44.900 --> 05:47.500]  It's a this is like an international issue.
[05:48.520 --> 05:50.820]  I kind of went through the same hurdle, Gavin.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.780]  But cotton candy is like a cloud.
[05:52.940 --> 05:54.020]  Clouds belong in the sky.
[05:54.100 --> 05:55.640]  They require air. It connects.
[05:55.640 --> 05:56.220]  It makes sense.
[05:56.660 --> 06:00.560]  Yeah, it is very air like a little bit of it would float for a second if you threw it up.
[06:00.780 --> 06:04.460]  Yeah, I'm saying there's something that's in the air, requires air in it.
[06:04.540 --> 06:06.880]  No, no, it's just you see, it's in the air.
[06:06.980 --> 06:08.360]  It's got a lot of air in it.
[06:08.440 --> 06:10.260]  But there's air in the sky, no matter what.
[06:10.500 --> 06:11.840]  A cloud is moisture.
[06:12.240 --> 06:15.100]  But when you see it in the air, you think of an air based thing.
[06:15.240 --> 06:17.500]  I think of air when I see stuff up there.
[06:18.140 --> 06:19.380]  Need some air for that plane.
[06:19.500 --> 06:20.460]  A plane is air?
[06:20.500 --> 06:21.440]  Yeah, need some air.
[06:22.060 --> 06:23.660]  There's some air assist in that plane.
[06:23.660 --> 06:26.540]  Well, it's metal or whatever they make a plane out of.
[06:26.800 --> 06:27.880]  Yeah, but there's air assisting.
[06:27.980 --> 06:28.620]  I think of the air.
[06:28.840 --> 06:30.680]  When I think of air, I think of things in the sky.
[06:30.780 --> 06:32.900]  When I think of things in the sky, I think of clouds.
[06:33.080 --> 06:34.420]  Cotton candy is essentially a cloud.
[06:34.660 --> 06:36.320]  What's the sneakiest thing in the air?
[06:37.920 --> 06:39.620]  Oh, falcon, falcon.
[06:39.800 --> 06:41.460]  You think a falcon is? Yeah, probably is.
[06:41.720 --> 06:43.240]  Fish. Is that a sign out yet?
[06:44.060 --> 06:45.240]  A flying fish?
[06:45.740 --> 06:46.600]  No, that is sneaky.
[06:46.720 --> 06:49.840]  I think they're having to re-sign, have to rework it a little bit.
[06:49.840 --> 06:54.840]  Yeah, it's more expensive to make a vertical sign than a square sign.
[06:56.260 --> 06:59.600]  Everything we've been pitching recently, Eric's like, hey, can we make this?
[06:59.660 --> 07:00.140]  And I'm like, yeah.
[07:00.220 --> 07:03.240]  And then they'll come back and be like, OK, well, to make a profit on that,
[07:03.320 --> 07:05.500]  we need to sell that at like fifty five dollars.
[07:05.660 --> 07:09.260]  It's like, oh, yeah, we're going to rework it to make a square sign.
[07:09.360 --> 07:10.560]  It'll be much more cost effective.
[07:10.940 --> 07:13.320]  Yeah, well, they said that like it was cheaper in a different shape.
[07:13.380 --> 07:15.400]  It made me wonder, what's the cheapest shape?
[07:15.680 --> 07:18.300]  What is the least valuable of the shapes?
[07:18.300 --> 07:20.000]  What is the most expensive shape?
[07:20.840 --> 07:23.980]  This whole episode has been questions with no answers.
[07:24.240 --> 07:26.320]  This is making me insane.
[07:26.420 --> 07:28.200]  No, we are like four minutes in.
[07:28.200 --> 07:29.040]  No, we're one for one.
[07:29.300 --> 07:32.740]  Oh, is it that every edge adds another cost?
[07:32.840 --> 07:33.820]  Is it like the more edges?
[07:34.440 --> 07:38.540]  Because technically a circle is one edge, but also it's loads.
[07:38.760 --> 07:43.240]  Like if you had something with 30 edges or 30 sides, I mean,
[07:43.600 --> 07:45.060]  then that's close to a circle.
[07:45.700 --> 07:47.240]  Yeah, I don't know.
[07:47.240 --> 07:48.600]  I just didn't make me think about it.
[07:48.940 --> 07:49.980]  Hey, Andrew. Yes.
[07:51.020 --> 07:52.640]  Uh, would Rice Krispies count?
[07:53.180 --> 07:55.640]  Oh, yeah, that's that's a good there's some air in that.
[07:55.980 --> 07:57.700]  That's right. Puffed rice, right?
[07:57.760 --> 07:58.620]  It's in the name. Puffed rice.
[07:58.840 --> 07:59.920]  Yeah, absolutely. That's a great.
[08:00.060 --> 08:02.780]  I'm going to throw my I'm going to throw my hat in the Rice Krispies ring.
[08:02.920 --> 08:06.200]  So are we going to have like a puffed snake draft?
[08:07.500 --> 08:08.960]  No, no, we haven't.
[08:09.640 --> 08:10.980]  We should we get into that?
[08:11.320 --> 08:14.080]  We have a whole other snake draft that Andrew wants to do.
[08:14.080 --> 08:18.440]  I think this is the most ridiculous bit that is actually going to happen.
[08:18.800 --> 08:20.700]  Why? I can't get behind this.
[08:21.000 --> 08:22.420]  Why? It's so stupid.
[08:22.820 --> 08:23.480]  It's so stupid.
[08:24.060 --> 08:26.740]  It's because you're not confident in your draft list.
[08:27.000 --> 08:31.420]  I have such a strong, I have such a strong draft list.
[08:31.740 --> 08:32.760]  Why do we need to watch it?
[08:32.800 --> 08:33.580]  It's the conversation.
[08:33.920 --> 08:35.160]  We don't fucking watch this podcast.
[08:35.920 --> 08:36.720]  It's no different.
[08:36.900 --> 08:38.120]  What are you talking about?
[08:38.740 --> 08:41.060]  I mean, some people do their photos.
[08:41.180 --> 08:41.720]  We have a YouTube.
[08:41.900 --> 08:43.160]  Some people do watch the podcast.
[08:43.160 --> 08:44.340]  But you do not.
[08:44.960 --> 08:46.080]  And that has never been a concern.
[08:46.540 --> 08:47.520]  What are you talking about?
[08:47.980 --> 08:49.080]  Please don't be mean to Gavin.
[08:49.500 --> 08:50.400]  I'm not being mean to Gavin.
[08:50.540 --> 08:52.520]  I'm just asking what he's talking about.
[08:54.300 --> 08:55.480]  Now, he's got a real good point, though.
[08:55.480 --> 08:56.460]  That was a dumb thing to say.
[08:57.420 --> 08:59.160]  Well, the other one was like video based, right?
[08:59.200 --> 08:59.920]  We could all watch a thing.
[08:59.940 --> 09:02.520]  Yeah, but they didn't, the audience didn't get the videos.
[09:03.880 --> 09:05.200]  What are you talking about?
[09:05.580 --> 09:07.240]  Well, at least they can go and watch them with us.
[09:07.320 --> 09:09.640]  You're going to just say, you got to explain this.
[09:09.660 --> 09:10.620]  Yeah, but they'll have their own opinions.
[09:11.140 --> 09:12.380]  It's not going to be as long.
[09:12.380 --> 09:14.100]  It's not going to be as long as the other one, probably.
[09:14.300 --> 09:14.840]  Well, I don't know.
[09:15.060 --> 09:16.460]  This might be more contentious.
[09:16.740 --> 09:19.580]  Andrew, what do you want to follow up the wildly successful
[09:19.580 --> 09:21.480]  Foles draft with?
[09:21.800 --> 09:22.680]  Give it the real name.
[09:23.680 --> 09:25.120]  The well, I'm now nervous.
[09:25.240 --> 09:26.220]  I don't know what the full name is.
[09:26.300 --> 09:27.760]  The rocks without rocks draft.
[09:27.920 --> 09:29.460]  The rocks that are not rocks draft.
[09:29.740 --> 09:30.820]  Rocks not rocks draft.
[09:30.900 --> 09:32.460]  Rocks not rocks draft. Yes.
[09:32.880 --> 09:36.000]  So it's things that are rock, but are not actually rock.
[09:36.080 --> 09:39.500]  So like the rock is a rock that is not a rock.
[09:39.560 --> 09:40.440]  That would be draft elegy.
[09:40.500 --> 09:42.280]  But diorite, that's off the table.
[09:42.280 --> 09:44.300]  That's not a yeah, that's not draft eligible.
[09:44.460 --> 09:45.360]  That's just a rock.
[09:45.680 --> 09:48.140]  I thought I had the best one of all time, which was the moon.
[09:48.360 --> 09:50.160]  But it's not draftable rock.
[09:50.320 --> 09:54.000]  I just I think the rock should be in the name of the thing that you're picking.
[09:54.460 --> 09:55.420]  Moon, that's just a personal.
[09:55.740 --> 09:57.080]  Yeah, but then that's just a rock.
[09:57.180 --> 09:57.780]  That's a rock.
[09:57.880 --> 10:00.520]  That's just you've just picked a rock at this point.
[10:00.900 --> 10:03.280]  It's just a rock on vacation from another place.
[10:03.500 --> 10:07.940]  So we're going to all pick four rocks that aren't rocks.
[10:08.300 --> 10:08.700]  Exactly.
[10:08.960 --> 10:10.360]  And then there's going to be teams.
[10:11.140 --> 10:13.180]  And then the audience is going to decide who wins.
[10:13.520 --> 10:15.340]  Nick won the first one by a landslide.
[10:15.440 --> 10:18.160]  So yeah, we'll let Nick make the draft order
[10:18.720 --> 10:20.600]  and then we'll just go on from there.
[10:21.040 --> 10:22.760]  Eric said, don't pick a rock moon rock.
[10:23.120 --> 10:27.180]  To be fair, Eric, he didn't say rocks that weren't rocks at first.
[10:27.740 --> 10:29.940]  He just said rock.
[10:30.240 --> 10:32.740]  Once it becomes a rock, it is no longer eligible.
[10:33.320 --> 10:35.040]  Right. But here's the thing with Andrew.
[10:35.120 --> 10:39.160]  I think we always know there's a thinly veiled twist coming right behind
[10:39.160 --> 10:41.280]  whatever the initial ask is.
[10:41.820 --> 10:44.320]  So I, I, I will side with you.
[10:44.480 --> 10:48.440]  I thought moon was a good pick until I saw where the rest of this was going.
[10:48.560 --> 10:51.080]  And then I thought moon was a bad pick, but I think rock.
[10:52.700 --> 10:56.160]  I will say the other bit of knowledge that I got because, Nick,
[10:56.180 --> 10:57.380]  I guess you're hearing this for the first time.
[10:57.500 --> 11:00.160]  So we'll need you to get four or probably a larger list
[11:00.160 --> 11:03.420]  to just so you have backups in case one of your draft picks gets selected.
[11:03.740 --> 11:06.000]  But we're going to need you to get rocks that aren't rocks.
[11:06.600 --> 11:09.560]  Uh, like, uh, you said pop rocks.
[11:09.680 --> 11:12.340]  That's a great that's a great example of one.
[11:13.020 --> 11:14.300]  Pet rock doesn't count, though.
[11:14.400 --> 11:16.520]  I tried over and over again with Andrew in text.
[11:16.680 --> 11:17.760]  And is that because it's a rock?
[11:18.620 --> 11:19.600]  Yeah, that's a rock.
[11:20.040 --> 11:22.520]  I initially argued it, but you put eyeballs on it.
[11:22.580 --> 11:23.480]  It becomes a person.
[11:23.680 --> 11:24.820]  Hang on. Hang on.
[11:24.960 --> 11:28.900]  So if I put eyeballs on Gavin's moon rock, it would be eligible?
[11:29.460 --> 11:30.040]  Moon with eyes.
[11:30.520 --> 11:31.100]  That's the other pick.
[11:31.100 --> 11:31.640]  Yeah.
[11:35.020 --> 11:36.640]  Let me put it this way.
[11:36.900 --> 11:40.180]  If you take the eyes off of Dwayne Johnson, he's just a rock.
[11:42.300 --> 11:42.800]  What?
[11:46.220 --> 11:50.140]  What about if you took the eyes off of Dwayne Johnson while playing
[11:50.140 --> 11:53.620]  the Scorpion King, is he still just a rock or is he a scorpion?
[11:54.020 --> 11:55.040]  That's a good question.
[11:55.460 --> 11:56.740]  At one point, I asked Andrew.
[11:58.760 --> 12:03.140]  Would the rock Dwayne Johnson be different from the rock Alcatraz?
[12:03.640 --> 12:05.000]  The nickname for Alcatraz.
[12:05.360 --> 12:09.440]  But then Andrew started talking about the rock The Movie, which is about the rock Alcatraz.
[12:09.740 --> 12:11.120]  So are there three rocks that we can get?
[12:11.320 --> 12:15.400]  If Dwayne Johnson was in the rock The Movie, would that be a triple threat rock?
[12:15.880 --> 12:17.840]  It would be. It would be a triple threat rock.
[12:18.240 --> 12:19.260]  I think you could draft Alcatraz.
[12:19.580 --> 12:25.820]  Can you draft Dwayne the Rock Johnson and then also draft the television show The Young Rock?
[12:26.460 --> 12:28.260]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, you could.
[12:28.420 --> 12:29.600]  Absolutely. Different things.
[12:29.840 --> 12:31.700]  Yeah. What if I put eyes on Alcatraz?
[12:32.800 --> 12:35.600]  I just said you could draft Alcatraz as is, I feel.
[12:35.660 --> 12:37.720]  OK. Hang on.
[12:37.940 --> 12:40.780]  You can draft Alcatraz, but you can't draft the moon?
[12:41.520 --> 12:42.740]  It's a. Well, it's still.
[12:43.420 --> 12:46.840]  If the moon was nicknamed the rock that I think it might be in, right?
[12:47.080 --> 12:49.260]  I don't think Alcatraz is made of rock.
[12:50.240 --> 12:54.760]  Like if you if you broke off, let's say, what are you talking about?
[12:54.760 --> 12:56.080]  Is it made of it?
[12:56.640 --> 12:58.260]  Why do you think they call it the rock?
[12:58.480 --> 13:01.880]  Well, I thought we're talking about the building itself, not the island.
[13:02.180 --> 13:04.500]  Oh, he's just referring to the prison on.
[13:04.680 --> 13:07.160]  Yeah, I thought we're talking about the island.
[13:07.300 --> 13:08.300]  That's the disconnect.
[13:08.380 --> 13:09.980]  Isn't it called Alcatraz Island?
[13:10.820 --> 13:13.220]  I did. I just assume that's what the prison was called.
[13:13.260 --> 13:14.480]  I didn't know what the island was called.
[13:14.600 --> 13:15.640]  That makes you don't know.
[13:16.480 --> 13:19.640]  I just assume the prison was Alcatraz and the island was whatever.
[13:19.760 --> 13:20.620]  Who cares? It's a prison.
[13:23.560 --> 13:25.200]  Isn't it? Does the island have a name?
[13:25.380 --> 13:26.820]  It's called Alcatraz Island.
[13:27.120 --> 13:28.520]  OK, and what's the prison called?
[13:29.300 --> 13:30.940]  Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary.
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.260]  Yeah, so it's that's that's a fair simply known as Alcatraz or the rock.
[13:35.540 --> 13:38.020]  Yeah, so that counts. Yeah, it's totally fine.
[13:38.880 --> 13:41.640]  If you refer to the penitentiary, if you're referring to the penitentiary,
[13:41.800 --> 13:46.300]  the confidence that you guys said Alcatraz, the prison was made out of rock
[13:46.300 --> 13:49.520]  was mind boggling to me as somebody who didn't understand the disconnect.
[13:49.520 --> 13:50.500]  That's like, what are you saying?
[13:50.980 --> 13:52.500]  An entire rock prison.
[13:52.640 --> 13:54.780]  They made a whole prison out of rock.
[13:54.900 --> 13:56.280]  I mean, it's a brick a rock.
[13:57.540 --> 13:59.900]  And now this is going to get into a semantics thing.
[14:00.100 --> 14:02.200]  It's like, yeah, I don't know why.
[14:02.280 --> 14:04.560]  And also, we're going to argue about this and you're not going to pick it.
[14:04.620 --> 14:05.640]  So I don't know. We could just move.
[14:05.660 --> 14:10.520]  I don't think a brick would be a rock, but I think a cinder block might be.
[14:11.240 --> 14:13.220]  Cinder block is very rocky when you break it.
[14:13.580 --> 14:14.400]  It does feel like.
[14:14.760 --> 14:18.340]  But a brick is just is just fired clay and mud, right?
[14:19.180 --> 14:22.560]  Is clay ever a rock or is it always mud?
[14:23.060 --> 14:26.080]  But naturally, I would consider it a mud, but I don't know.
[14:26.360 --> 14:27.440]  Naturally. How about this?
[14:27.520 --> 14:29.840]  We delete this recording and start again.
[14:30.160 --> 14:33.480]  Why? This is the dumbest conversation we've ever had on this podcast.
[14:33.860 --> 14:36.820]  I don't think so. I think you're just very anti rock for some reason.
[14:37.380 --> 14:40.240]  I just can't believe this is our next draft.
[14:40.480 --> 14:42.740]  I can't believe we're going from falls to rock.
[14:43.200 --> 14:45.600]  Oh, shit. Clay is a rock.
[14:46.540 --> 14:47.780]  Really? OK.
[14:47.780 --> 14:49.220]  Well, then clay is off the board.
[14:49.380 --> 14:53.760]  Clay is a fine grained, small particle sized sedimentary rock.
[14:53.880 --> 14:57.500]  Oh, shit. So it's like a rock hive mind.
[14:58.820 --> 14:59.880]  It's like the borg.
[15:00.260 --> 15:02.440]  Yeah. So like a rock borg.
[15:02.800 --> 15:04.220]  So what I. Oh, clay, clay.
[15:04.460 --> 15:07.780]  Wait, would I be able to draft Muhammad Ali?
[15:12.120 --> 15:12.920]  Oh, interesting.
[15:13.020 --> 15:14.240]  I wonder if that's an interesting.
[15:14.980 --> 15:16.540]  Yeah, I don't know. We'd have to think about that.
[15:17.020 --> 15:19.100]  Well, I think we're all here and we can think about it.
[15:19.120 --> 15:20.100]  But we're not drafting.
[15:20.240 --> 15:21.840]  Gavin, would you care to weigh in on that?
[15:21.840 --> 15:23.420]  Oh, but clay is a rock. I see what you're saying.
[15:23.720 --> 15:25.240]  No, no, I don't think.
[15:25.640 --> 15:27.800]  I don't know why we just established that clay is a rock.
[15:28.100 --> 15:32.220]  I think the spirit of the thing is that rock is somewhere in the name.
[15:32.860 --> 15:35.520]  Gavin can't have the moon and I can't have Muhammad Ali.
[15:35.900 --> 15:37.680]  Well, you would be drafting Cassius Clay.
[15:38.020 --> 15:38.740]  Right. Correct.
[15:39.340 --> 15:41.680]  Which he then changed his name to Muhammad Ali.
[15:41.780 --> 15:44.300]  So I don't think you would actually get any of Muhammad Ali.
[15:44.300 --> 15:47.360]  You would get up to the point in which he changed his name.
[15:47.760 --> 15:50.160]  So you would get a specific timeline of his life.
[15:50.480 --> 15:53.280]  Yes, I think you would get prior Ali.
[15:53.920 --> 15:55.580]  Oh, I think there's a cut off.
[15:55.620 --> 15:57.880]  What is this?
[15:58.060 --> 16:00.240]  Nick Stone called Steve Austin.
[16:03.180 --> 16:06.960]  That's that's I know Stone Rock, but not once again,
[16:06.960 --> 16:09.120]  I think the spirit of the thing is rock is in the neck.
[16:09.680 --> 16:13.620]  You can have Cassius Clay up until March 6th, 1964.
[16:14.380 --> 16:15.940]  That's pretty good. Those are good years.
[16:16.140 --> 16:18.500]  Yeah, those are pretty good. Not the best years, though.
[16:19.240 --> 16:20.120]  There's some good stuff.
[16:20.180 --> 16:23.880]  I mean, I think it'd be up to him to determine why what his best years were.
[16:23.940 --> 16:28.500]  I think if Cassius Clay is on my draft list, I think it looks pretty strong.
[16:29.620 --> 16:32.060]  Interesting. Gavin, do you love this?
[16:32.400 --> 16:35.580]  I'm not like it's I just can't.
[16:35.680 --> 16:38.520]  I felt like that would this would be like the 25th draft.
[16:38.760 --> 16:41.460]  I can't I just can't believe we've gone from full videos
[16:43.880 --> 16:47.080]  to deciding what isn't isn't a rock that isn't a rock.
[16:47.600 --> 16:48.960]  No, but that's not what we're arguing.
[16:49.140 --> 16:50.680]  The best rock is a rock.
[16:50.920 --> 16:54.120]  I also got to say, I know that you were you were saying it that way
[16:54.120 --> 16:57.200]  in some sort of a derogatory or defamatory way.
[16:57.340 --> 17:00.380]  But the way you just described it makes me want to do it even more now.
[17:00.820 --> 17:02.760]  It kind of makes me want to do it, too.
[17:03.860 --> 17:06.140]  Like you're selling me on this idea again.
[17:06.740 --> 17:10.000]  This conversation is so it's going to be a great draft.
[17:10.000 --> 17:13.700]  I'll be I'll be honest, the the text version of this conversation
[17:13.700 --> 17:15.700]  was one of the dumbest things I've ever read.
[17:16.600 --> 17:19.620]  Now, one day be in our face book of texts.
[17:22.440 --> 17:24.360]  I'm so excited about my list of rocks.
[17:25.200 --> 17:28.160]  OK, so what are we doing this next office day?
[17:28.700 --> 17:29.660]  When's the next office day?
[17:30.240 --> 17:31.960]  I don't know. We have weeks from now.
[17:32.420 --> 17:34.880]  Yeah, we have an office day scheduled for the seventh.
[17:35.320 --> 17:36.500]  OK. OK.
[17:37.780 --> 17:40.800]  Hey, speaking of that, while we're scheduling,
[17:41.080 --> 17:43.260]  while we're doing every audience's favorite bits,
[17:44.380 --> 17:46.940]  when do we schedule the sloppy Joes thing?
[17:47.020 --> 17:48.340]  We should probably put that on the books, too.
[17:48.660 --> 17:51.200]  Do we ever confirm that we can legally do that?
[17:51.420 --> 17:55.320]  We're going to figure that part out, but we can we can get it on the books.
[17:55.560 --> 17:57.760]  And then that'll be incentive to get it figured out.
[17:57.860 --> 17:59.000]  And we're doing that live, are we?
[17:59.560 --> 18:00.400]  I think so.
[18:00.760 --> 18:02.760]  Would we do it live or would we record?
[18:02.860 --> 18:04.360]  We can let people know they record it.
[18:04.360 --> 18:07.500]  And then, yeah, I think if we're allowed to show the thing,
[18:09.220 --> 18:10.960]  we we should we should have it.
[18:11.360 --> 18:15.160]  But yeah, as of as like a VOD of something people can no longer see.
[18:15.240 --> 18:16.380]  No, no, no. We should definitely.
[18:16.560 --> 18:18.980]  The only way we can do this is if people can see this. Yes.
[18:19.300 --> 18:23.820]  Yeah. OK, so we need to figure that when we're going to do that.
[18:23.880 --> 18:26.660]  And also I have one clip.
[18:26.700 --> 18:27.660]  I didn't make this clip.
[18:27.780 --> 18:31.340]  But if this I feel like this and Eric has seen it,
[18:31.340 --> 18:33.320]  I think I feel like this explains.
[18:34.400 --> 18:39.200]  All of the best of Sloppy Joe's in one one minute clip,
[18:39.340 --> 18:42.820]  it takes about 15 seconds to get in, but watch.
[18:43.340 --> 18:44.780]  Watch what goes on here.
[18:45.120 --> 18:47.220]  It's called a mess on the sidewalk.
[18:48.020 --> 18:49.600]  Yeah. Feel free to explain it as it goes.
[18:50.300 --> 18:52.100]  Is that some U.S. flag underwear?
[18:52.700 --> 18:54.200]  That is a lady wearing short shorts.
[18:54.560 --> 18:56.100]  She's on a bicycle wearing U.S.
[18:56.120 --> 18:58.980]  flag, short shorts and a shirt that's a football jersey.
[18:59.200 --> 19:00.140]  I can't read the last name,
[19:00.140 --> 19:01.820]  but the number is sixty nine.
[19:02.960 --> 19:05.620]  She's got flip flops on on her bike.
[19:05.840 --> 19:09.140]  Oh, oh, oh,
[19:10.420 --> 19:12.500]  here we go. Oh, no.
[19:14.960 --> 19:17.360]  Oh, now I got what she dropped.
[19:18.380 --> 19:21.240]  If you pause it, you'll notice that not only.
[19:21.400 --> 19:24.260]  So what happens, audience, is she's riding a bike next to the sidewalk.
[19:24.400 --> 19:25.120]  She falls over.
[19:25.480 --> 19:28.220]  She barrels into a couple that's walking down the street.
[19:28.860 --> 19:31.740]  I'd like to point out, as you finish this video, at no point
[19:31.740 --> 19:35.040]  does she ever turn around and apologize to those people or acknowledge
[19:35.040 --> 19:36.280]  their existence at all.
[19:36.420 --> 19:39.260]  Like she almost broke the lady in the orange shorts leg.
[19:39.660 --> 19:42.220]  And she just it's like they don't exist to her
[19:42.220 --> 19:45.700]  because she spilled a drink and some stuff when she bends over.
[19:46.020 --> 19:50.160]  Her entire asshole comes out of her shorts and she just doesn't care.
[19:50.560 --> 19:53.260]  And then she collects all of her shit and rides away.
[19:53.740 --> 19:56.200]  She also fell over from what appeared to be nothing.
[19:56.200 --> 19:57.980]  Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
[19:58.080 --> 20:00.880]  It it looked like a glitch in GTA.
[20:01.220 --> 20:03.440]  Her falling over like it didn't look human.
[20:03.600 --> 20:05.840]  It's just like on the floor, like everything around it.
[20:06.820 --> 20:09.120]  The people walking away are so befuddled.
[20:09.340 --> 20:10.100]  They like, what the fuck?
[20:10.580 --> 20:12.280]  Poor other woman who just.
[20:13.920 --> 20:17.220]  She's going to get seriously fucking hurt, man.
[20:17.620 --> 20:18.500]  That's it. That's the whole clip.
[20:18.560 --> 20:20.300]  Then it's just like a family staring at the screen.
[20:20.400 --> 20:23.220]  But I saw that the other day that somebody else had captured that.
[20:23.260 --> 20:25.020]  And I laughed so hard I had to show you guys.
[20:26.920 --> 20:28.280]  Yeah, she got gentle ghosted.
[20:29.980 --> 20:30.840]  That's funny, Nick.
[20:33.460 --> 20:34.420]  Oh, this is going to be great.
[20:34.500 --> 20:35.640]  I'm excited for Sloppy Joe's.
[20:35.720 --> 20:39.040]  Are we doing a Sloppy Joe's pizzas on the day on the day or not?
[20:39.500 --> 20:40.240]  Let's do it.
[20:41.180 --> 20:44.260]  Yeah, I just I just want any excuse to somehow make.
[20:44.940 --> 20:46.340]  F*** face supplemental stuff.
[20:46.420 --> 20:47.240]  Also a pizza day.
[20:47.740 --> 20:48.300]  Yeah, I'm into that.
[20:49.120 --> 20:51.680]  Do you do you want to try to do next Friday?
[20:51.980 --> 20:55.520]  I mean, when this comes out, people won't be able to like watch it live with us.
[20:55.520 --> 20:56.860]  But I mean, whatever.
[20:58.780 --> 21:00.620]  Do you want to do the 31st or no?
[21:02.400 --> 21:05.300]  Oh, let me look at my calendar real fast.
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.900]  Oh, no. Where'd my calendar go?
[21:12.570 --> 21:14.030]  I mean, we just scheduled this later.
[21:14.350 --> 21:14.990]  Yeah, we could.
[21:15.290 --> 21:17.010]  Yeah, I thought this was I'm sorry.
[21:17.190 --> 21:19.250]  I thought this was going to be a lot faster.
[21:19.710 --> 21:20.810]  Yeah, I want to do it next Friday.
[21:21.370 --> 21:22.510]  OK, next Friday.
[21:23.190 --> 21:24.790]  Getting the bingo, Sloppy Joe's bingo.
[21:25.270 --> 21:28.210]  Yeah. OK, guys are getting together for it.
[21:28.430 --> 21:29.530]  That's a yes from Geoff.
[21:30.370 --> 21:32.050]  And it sounds like a yes from Andrew.
[21:32.990 --> 21:34.790]  Yeah, no, I'm yeah, for sure.
[21:34.870 --> 21:35.810]  OK. Yeah, man.
[21:36.370 --> 21:37.550]  Yeah, there you go.
[21:37.950 --> 21:38.790]  OK, moving on.
[21:38.910 --> 21:40.490]  Hey, Gav, what did you want to talk about today?
[21:40.530 --> 21:41.030]  Do you get anything?
[21:41.910 --> 21:43.690]  I've got a bunch of notes I don't understand.
[21:44.990 --> 21:46.230]  What do I do understand?
[21:46.970 --> 21:51.610]  I had I had something kind of related to you, but not at all related to you.
[21:51.790 --> 21:56.830]  Gavin, I was talking to Geoff yesterday about stuff we could bring up on the show
[21:56.830 --> 21:58.930]  and I was thinking about what could I add to my list?
[21:59.430 --> 22:00.390]  What did I forget?
[22:00.510 --> 22:02.090]  I often forget the right things down.
[22:02.230 --> 22:03.290]  So it's just kind of like going over.
[22:03.810 --> 22:05.390]  And I realized something happened to me.
[22:05.490 --> 22:09.250]  That is a strange inconvenience that was so annoying.
[22:09.690 --> 22:11.730]  And then I had the realization text chat.
[22:11.990 --> 22:15.910]  It theoretically could have been you, but I don't think it's you.
[22:16.170 --> 22:17.470]  There's less than one percent.
[22:18.130 --> 22:19.910]  Yes. Somebody.
[22:20.170 --> 22:21.370]  I had a crime.
[22:21.910 --> 22:23.630]  I had a crime committed against me
[22:23.630 --> 22:27.230]  that is one of the most low stakes,
[22:27.510 --> 22:29.950]  but just annoying things that has happened.
[22:30.290 --> 22:33.430]  Somebody stole my doorbell, but not
[22:34.090 --> 22:37.170]  not the mechanics of the doorbell.
[22:37.450 --> 22:40.810]  They stole the button of the door, the part you push.
[22:40.890 --> 22:41.750]  It's not a ring.
[22:42.170 --> 22:43.390]  There's nothing there.
[22:43.750 --> 22:48.070]  I just I have lost my doorbell because somebody is taking it.
[22:48.470 --> 22:52.370]  I was texting Geoff about this and I was like,
[22:52.370 --> 22:55.490]  this is this fucking annoying problem that I'm trying to solve.
[22:55.810 --> 22:57.090]  Someone took my doorbell.
[22:57.270 --> 22:58.450]  What if it was Gavin?
[22:58.690 --> 23:00.050]  What if he snuck up?
[23:00.250 --> 23:03.150]  What a what a cucumber revenge that would have been.
[23:03.530 --> 23:06.290]  You sneak up, you steal my doorbell and you go.
[23:06.870 --> 23:09.030]  And you just are going to send a photo of the plaster.
[23:09.270 --> 23:11.930]  Now there's less than one percent chance that this was you.
[23:12.410 --> 23:13.890]  But I got mad.
[23:13.950 --> 23:15.350]  I was like, fuck, what if you got me?
[23:15.610 --> 23:16.610]  What if he got me?
[23:17.290 --> 23:18.970]  Because I didn't I didn't catch you did this.
[23:19.170 --> 23:21.890]  But is this a communal doorbell to other apartments?
[23:21.890 --> 23:23.510]  No, just just mine.
[23:23.830 --> 23:24.690]  Just mine.
[23:25.870 --> 23:27.130]  Wow. Yeah.
[23:27.350 --> 23:30.530]  You told me this yesterday, you didn't tell me what it was that was stolen.
[23:30.810 --> 23:33.410]  I I wouldn't in a million years have guessed.
[23:33.710 --> 23:35.650]  No, there's no value in it.
[23:35.710 --> 23:37.350]  I don't understand why this happened.
[23:37.510 --> 23:39.550]  But it's not even like a ring doorbell or anything.
[23:39.630 --> 23:41.190]  No, there's nothing of value.
[23:41.250 --> 23:43.370]  It's just it's it's basic.
[23:43.430 --> 23:44.370]  It's a basic doorbell.
[23:44.430 --> 23:46.370]  And they took to what's left. Just wires.
[23:46.550 --> 23:47.730]  Or is it just what? Yes.
[23:47.790 --> 23:50.690]  If the doorbell is just like the the back casing of it.
[23:51.290 --> 23:54.030]  So if someone grabs the wires and just shorts them together,
[23:54.110 --> 23:55.170]  does it still ring the doorbell?
[23:55.510 --> 23:56.390]  I don't think so.
[23:56.750 --> 23:57.770]  I'll take a photo for it.
[23:57.890 --> 23:59.610]  It should. And I'll send it to you.
[24:00.090 --> 24:01.330]  I might. Yeah, I guess it could.
[24:02.150 --> 24:02.770]  I don't know.
[24:03.030 --> 24:05.550]  It hasn't rung since it's been taken.
[24:05.890 --> 24:08.030]  Delivery driver's having to hotwire your doorbell.
[24:10.870 --> 24:13.030]  Do you have any enemies in the neighborhood?
[24:13.710 --> 24:15.270]  No, not that I'm aware of.
[24:15.850 --> 24:18.390]  Not that I'm you know, not that it was just it's odd.
[24:19.030 --> 24:20.270]  There are always people walking by.
[24:20.270 --> 24:21.650]  So, you know, I don't know.
[24:22.230 --> 24:25.590]  Someone must have taken it or maybe a bird is possible.
[24:25.750 --> 24:28.110]  There are birds living in my roof.
[24:28.410 --> 24:32.290]  So so you think a bird ripped a doorbell off?
[24:32.370 --> 24:32.970]  I don't know.
[24:33.030 --> 24:35.450]  Let's why would a person take the doorbell at the point?
[24:35.550 --> 24:37.670]  Like there's no logic has gone out the window here.
[24:37.990 --> 24:40.070]  I mean, we were talking about sneaky things in the air.
[24:41.010 --> 24:41.690]  That is true.
[24:42.310 --> 24:45.110]  I just it's been a ridiculous problem to try to solve.
[24:45.390 --> 24:48.590]  As somebody who grew up in the deep south in Florida and Alabama, people
[24:48.590 --> 24:51.350]  people will steal anything, anything.
[24:51.390 --> 24:52.790]  Yes. For any reason.
[24:53.210 --> 24:54.130]  Just just because.
[24:54.810 --> 24:58.470]  So clearly, is it like are you like in an area where a lot of people walk by?
[24:58.650 --> 25:02.350]  Like, oh, yeah, drunk on a Friday night, like maybe somebody was just like drunk
[25:02.350 --> 25:03.850]  and shenaniganing.
[25:04.110 --> 25:07.030]  I think definitely that is the most likely suspect.
[25:07.330 --> 25:12.710]  Have you checked any adjacent or nearby doors to see if they want their doorbell?
[25:13.070 --> 25:18.150]  That's the yeah, it's the real annoying thing is there's a a unit next to where I live.
[25:18.590 --> 25:20.310]  That is vacant. Nobody's there.
[25:20.950 --> 25:22.850]  And their doorbell's fine.
[25:23.070 --> 25:24.050]  They didn't take that doorbell.
[25:24.270 --> 25:25.610]  That doorbell fully functional.
[25:26.070 --> 25:27.290]  Doesn't mean it's not needed.
[25:27.810 --> 25:31.710]  I should maybe steal their doorbell to put it on my doorbell
[25:32.210 --> 25:35.570]  because it's the same bell that actually might be a solution to my problem.
[25:36.010 --> 25:37.050]  I should consider that.
[25:37.290 --> 25:38.490]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[25:39.310 --> 25:42.910]  This is also an opportunity now you have.
[25:43.850 --> 25:47.990]  You could put any doorbell on earth there and you have a reason to like
[25:47.990 --> 25:49.350]  you have a need for a doorbell.
[25:49.690 --> 25:51.550]  So instead of just rushing to replace your doorbell
[25:51.550 --> 25:54.190]  with the exact doorbell you had, maybe you should do some research
[25:54.190 --> 25:58.170]  and see if there's any like cool Japanese doorbells.
[25:58.250 --> 25:59.110]  There has to be, right?
[25:59.330 --> 26:02.670]  Right. That like have like smart doorbells that do cool stuff
[26:02.670 --> 26:04.890]  or like a doorbell that cleans your asshole?
[26:05.310 --> 26:06.950]  Yeah, like a doorbell that cleans your asshole
[26:07.430 --> 26:11.850]  and has it warms your finger while it does it or maybe a doorbell
[26:11.850 --> 26:14.850]  that has a camera so that the next time somebody comes to steal your doorbell,
[26:14.930 --> 26:15.910]  you can see them take it.
[26:16.470 --> 26:20.870]  Yeah, but I like the idea of the feed still going post it being taken.
[26:21.150 --> 26:24.910]  Like you just see the feed from the street inside a bird's nest.
[26:25.070 --> 26:25.630]  Yeah.
[26:28.170 --> 26:32.190]  It'd be the first like bird cam that was installed by the bird itself.
[26:34.350 --> 26:37.970]  Do you guys remember Senior Ding Dong from The Simpsons?
[26:39.250 --> 26:40.830]  No, I don't.
[26:41.830 --> 26:44.330]  It was a guy that owned a doorbell store.
[26:44.330 --> 26:45.530]  Oh, that's great.
[26:46.730 --> 26:47.790]  Here he is.
[26:48.410 --> 26:50.250]  Uh, it just popped into my head.
[26:50.390 --> 26:53.250]  Would it be weird if you just had a bell on your door?
[26:53.910 --> 26:56.570]  Like did there used to be bells on the outside of a house?
[26:57.110 --> 26:57.990]  I assume so.
[26:58.690 --> 26:59.690]  Yeah. And you just give them a ring?
[27:00.090 --> 27:00.890]  That would make sense.
[27:01.230 --> 27:03.730]  Oh, what if you could get a tiny replica of the Liberty Bell?
[27:05.130 --> 27:06.650]  Oh, I don't know.
[27:06.790 --> 27:09.330]  It doesn't necessarily play in Canada in the same way.
[27:09.650 --> 27:11.250]  Yeah, but it's like kitschy, you know?
[27:11.530 --> 27:12.390]  What about Big Ben?
[27:12.890 --> 27:15.230]  I mean, I'm now living in a world
[27:15.230 --> 27:18.090]  where I'm anticipating my doorbell always being stolen.
[27:18.410 --> 27:20.430]  So I don't it's almost like I don't want to pick one.
[27:20.530 --> 27:21.230]  I love too much.
[27:21.370 --> 27:22.790]  I don't want it to be a loss.
[27:23.730 --> 27:27.150]  Get a get like a church bell, like a big one,
[27:27.250 --> 27:28.970]  like kind of like what the Liberty Bell is.
[27:29.230 --> 27:31.430]  Although if you want to be a Phillies fan, what better way to show support
[27:31.430 --> 27:33.350]  than to have a Liberty Bell right there?
[27:33.850 --> 27:34.970]  It's nothing more Philly than that.
[27:34.990 --> 27:37.690]  But get like a big church bell that's too heavy to move.
[27:37.870 --> 27:42.250]  Now, should I install the bell in the front or should I put it on the roof
[27:42.250 --> 27:45.130]  and just have a rope that goes down to the front?
[27:45.550 --> 27:46.470]  Now, that's an idea.
[27:47.030 --> 27:47.790]  And you can just put it.
[27:48.210 --> 27:52.450]  You can put an arrow facing up where the old doorbell used to be.
[27:55.590 --> 27:57.010]  That's just been my small annoyance.
[27:57.130 --> 28:00.290]  There's part of me I realized because you've been traveling recently, Gavin.
[28:00.370 --> 28:01.190]  I was like, that motherfucker.
[28:01.350 --> 28:01.990]  What if he?
[28:03.750 --> 28:05.190]  What a move that would have been.
[28:05.830 --> 28:07.810]  You didn't steal it, is what you're saying, Gavin.
[28:07.950 --> 28:09.750]  I can confirm I did not steal the bell.
[28:10.830 --> 28:11.630]  That's tragic.
[28:11.630 --> 28:12.810]  Not yet, at least.
[28:13.450 --> 28:14.990]  Well, now he's going to steal. That's the problem.
[28:15.090 --> 28:17.770]  I'm going to get this fancy new bell and Gavin's going to come steal it.
[28:23.340 --> 28:25.240]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[28:25.520 --> 28:27.740]  Getting to know yourself can be a lifelong process,
[28:27.840 --> 28:29.880]  especially because we're always growing and changing.
[28:30.280 --> 28:33.540]  It's so important to reflect on those changes as they're happening
[28:33.540 --> 28:35.720]  and try to discover how they're impacting you.
[28:36.400 --> 28:39.040]  Therapy is all about deepening your self-awareness and understanding
[28:39.040 --> 28:42.640]  because sometimes we don't know what we want or why we react the way we do
[28:42.640 --> 28:44.280]  until we talk through things.
[28:44.280 --> 28:46.340]  BetterHelp connects you with a licensed therapist
[28:46.340 --> 28:50.080]  who can take you on that journey of self-discovery from wherever you are.

[29:41.720 --> 29:43.780]  like when you don't see it coming and it just is there.

[30:45.840 --> 30:48.620]  Let's face it, with coffee starting at five dollars
[30:48.620 --> 30:52.120]  and our bank accounts constantly depleting due to how expensive most things are,
[30:52.400 --> 30:54.420]  we are officially entering a dupe session.
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.160]  Most products do the same thing, but are priced differently.
[30:57.500 --> 30:59.060]  Solely based on the brand name.
[30:59.420 --> 31:02.800]  So a good duplicate or dupe is crucial for getting the highest quality
[31:02.800 --> 31:04.280]  at the best price.
[31:04.760 --> 31:06.880]  One dupe you definitely shouldn't sleep on.
[31:06.880 --> 31:08.920]  Are Raycon wireless earbuds.
[31:09.440 --> 31:12.040]  Raycon is premium audio at the perfect price point.

[31:16.080 --> 31:20.360]  Raycon offers a fantastic series of products and they are at such a great price.
[31:20.580 --> 31:23.320]  You would have to be crazy to not think about getting them.
[31:23.820 --> 31:24.540]  They're fantastic.
[31:24.780 --> 31:25.860]  I'd recommend them to anyone.
[31:26.440 --> 31:28.940]  And what's important to know is that Raycon's mission is to prove
[31:28.940 --> 31:31.400]  that you shouldn't have to pay an arm and leg for quality sound
[31:31.400 --> 31:33.280]  and essential smart tech listening features.
[31:33.740 --> 31:35.200]  You can get a pair and a spare
[31:35.200 --> 31:37.260]  and still pay less than you would
[31:37.260 --> 31:40.220]  with some of those other more big name tech brands out there.
[31:40.760 --> 31:44.160]  Raycon knows that in this economy, every purchase needs to be perfect.

[32:09.520 --> 32:13.180]  awareness mode, water and sweat resistance, clear call quality.
[32:13.280 --> 32:14.020]  That's all. They're great.
[32:14.100 --> 32:16.540]  So many great things I love about my Raycons.

[32:31.500 --> 32:32.540]  Here's what we will.
[32:32.540 --> 32:33.880]  Here's what we need to do.
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.340]  We have a mystery.
[32:35.500 --> 32:37.380]  Andrew, you have presented us with the mystery.
[32:37.520 --> 32:38.660]  We need to solve it.
[32:39.380 --> 32:43.740]  So we need to put we need to put a decoy bell
[32:44.340 --> 32:47.340]  and see if somebody tries to strike again, like a bell
[32:47.340 --> 32:49.000]  that if you touch it, it electrocutes you.
[32:49.540 --> 32:51.160]  Oh, well, here's the thing.
[32:52.560 --> 32:56.160]  I may be indebted to this person because I've this is the second thing
[32:56.160 --> 32:56.860]  I've had stolen.
[32:56.860 --> 33:01.180]  The last thing that was stolen was I ordered a big order
[33:01.180 --> 33:05.440]  of Skittles gummies from Amazon, and they took those.
[33:05.580 --> 33:08.040]  But then those ended up having metal in them.
[33:08.120 --> 33:12.140]  There was a whole factory recall of those specific gummies at that time.
[33:12.440 --> 33:13.560]  So in a way, they saved my life.
[33:13.860 --> 33:15.020]  We talked about this on the show.
[33:15.460 --> 33:17.460]  Yeah, this is this is a hero saving move.
[33:17.540 --> 33:18.540]  You think they're dead either?
[33:18.600 --> 33:20.540]  Either they're dead or they just got out of the hospital
[33:20.540 --> 33:21.720]  and they want to get revenge.
[33:22.980 --> 33:25.560]  Took the only thing on your front porch they could find.
[33:26.060 --> 33:27.940]  It is. Yeah, that's the only thing that's left.
[33:28.180 --> 33:31.700]  Everything else that was there that was decorative has been stolen across time.
[33:31.780 --> 33:34.220]  It's literally the only thing they could take.
[33:35.140 --> 33:36.200]  Is my doorbell.
[33:37.140 --> 33:39.560]  I've I've got a new life hack.
[33:39.960 --> 33:43.240]  This all along these paths. OK.
[33:44.040 --> 33:48.560]  If you've got a delivery that is just garbage to everyone else,
[33:48.660 --> 33:52.420]  like completely worthless, you could just leave it outside.
[33:54.020 --> 33:58.260]  If you have a delivery that is garbage, like I ordered, it's cheap.
[33:58.340 --> 34:02.640]  It's like I drink a lot of that bubbly drink, the pink one, grapefruit bubbly.
[34:03.060 --> 34:05.000]  Yeah. So I order like 10 cases at a time.
[34:05.920 --> 34:09.280]  And I'm always like, oh, I'm going to put 10 fricking cases of stuff
[34:09.280 --> 34:10.360]  and they're like heavy to move.
[34:10.760 --> 34:11.580]  I just leave them outside.
[34:13.680 --> 34:14.600]  Who's going to take them?
[34:16.340 --> 34:19.660]  Well, OK, in the world in which my doorbell is being stolen,
[34:19.960 --> 34:22.120]  I feel those are much more valuable.
[34:22.120 --> 34:25.580]  I would gladly steal your your mineral water.
[34:26.100 --> 34:27.180]  You would steal that?
[34:27.800 --> 34:30.380]  A hundred percent, I would, especially in Austin.
[34:30.740 --> 34:35.040]  There have been times I've been lost in that city, dying of heat, thirsty.
[34:35.400 --> 34:40.040]  If I came across a giant supply of vitamin water, whatever mineral water,
[34:40.480 --> 34:41.440]  I would steal that.
[34:41.680 --> 34:44.660]  I've just been opening the front door, grabbing them one at a time.
[34:44.860 --> 34:46.920]  And then I just like, where the fuck could you let?
[34:47.040 --> 34:48.940]  Well, no, wait, wait.
[34:48.940 --> 34:50.120]  Warm. You're not.
[34:50.520 --> 34:52.440]  Well, you put an ice in, you're putting ice in, right?
[34:52.620 --> 34:53.940]  I'm not an ice guy, I'll be honest.
[34:54.120 --> 34:57.280]  So you're just having a hot, hot, bubbly.
[34:57.680 --> 34:58.540]  I mean, they're in the shade.
[34:58.700 --> 35:00.480]  They're not boiling hot.
[35:00.960 --> 35:02.880]  They will be in like a month.
[35:03.080 --> 35:04.540]  Yeah, this is definitely a winter hack.
[35:04.800 --> 35:05.600]  It's a winter hack.
[35:05.820 --> 35:12.240]  But but I just I just thought the value to effort ratio is way off.
[35:12.300 --> 35:16.300]  Like to steal something that's heavy and only costs like three dollars fifty
[35:17.060 --> 35:18.160]  for like eight cans.
[35:18.160 --> 35:20.300]  I think that's completely worthless to steal.
[35:21.340 --> 35:24.920]  I think I would be more worried about somebody walking by being thirsty,
[35:25.180 --> 35:28.240]  walking up, popping one open, taking a sit and just drinking it
[35:28.240 --> 35:31.040]  and then turning my front porch into like an impromptu coffee shop.
[35:32.060 --> 35:33.900]  Hmm. Maybe that'll happen.
[35:34.060 --> 35:36.600]  I mean, there might be a way to make friends in the neighborhood.
[35:36.940 --> 35:41.800]  Look, this might not be a great long term hack, but right now I'm making use of space
[35:41.800 --> 35:46.060]  that has previously previously been utterly useless for storage.
[35:46.060 --> 35:50.300]  Yeah, it's not that I hate the life hack as much as I dislike the move.
[35:51.660 --> 35:52.660]  Do you are you a fan?
[35:53.180 --> 35:54.700]  I like refrigeration.
[35:54.800 --> 35:56.520]  I like a nice cold beverage.
[35:56.640 --> 35:59.180]  I want to feel refreshed, like leaving it outside.
[35:59.940 --> 36:01.720]  Well, maybe what if I had a little fridge out there?
[36:02.420 --> 36:05.260]  Well, I'm talking about becoming, you know, a porch guy.
[36:05.480 --> 36:08.360]  So maybe it looks like the porch is in use constantly.
[36:08.660 --> 36:10.960]  Then no one will go for the the swipe.
[36:11.240 --> 36:14.400]  As a desk guy, I respect you're wanting to be a porch guy
[36:14.400 --> 36:18.100]  and the moves that you feel you need to make to to have that space be yours.
[36:18.220 --> 36:20.580]  I like the idea of a porch fridge.
[36:21.560 --> 36:23.580]  And you think someone won't steal the fridge?
[36:24.420 --> 36:27.980]  I don't think they'll steal the fridge, but you need to have like a locking mechanism,
[36:27.980 --> 36:30.020]  I think, for opening it.
[36:30.680 --> 36:31.620]  Does that exist?
[36:32.340 --> 36:34.220]  Or is there like a button lock you could do?
[36:34.300 --> 36:36.480]  Like, you don't want to have to use a key, then that becomes annoying.
[36:36.600 --> 36:38.020]  But like, is there a lock fridge?
[36:38.580 --> 36:39.960]  Like a smart lock for a fridge?
[36:39.960 --> 36:41.320]  Yeah, like a smart lock for a fridge.
[36:41.440 --> 36:43.160]  Does that? That has to exist, right?
[36:44.400 --> 36:45.340]  I would assume so.
[36:45.700 --> 36:46.660]  Why wouldn't that exist?
[36:46.820 --> 36:48.820]  They have everything else in fridges at this point.
[36:49.120 --> 36:51.280]  One of my fingerprint door handles to it.
[36:51.880 --> 36:53.360]  That now that's the move.
[36:53.740 --> 36:57.540]  I wish you would have come up with this idea like two months ago.
[36:57.620 --> 36:58.760]  I could have given you a fridge.
[37:00.320 --> 37:03.140]  Oh, you could have had my old fridge on your front porch.
[37:03.580 --> 37:07.960]  I feel like it being outside might be as effective as your old fridge
[37:07.960 --> 37:10.100]  based on the conversations had on this podcast.
[37:10.380 --> 37:12.360]  I actually don't think that that would have been positive for you.
[37:12.700 --> 37:13.840]  Fridge combo lock, there you go.
[37:13.840 --> 37:15.340]  Eric's got a perfect one.
[37:15.700 --> 37:18.860]  Yeah, but if you look up a little bit, Nick found a keyless refrigerator
[37:18.860 --> 37:20.800]  lock system for two doors.
[37:21.260 --> 37:22.160]  Ooh, perfect.
[37:23.380 --> 37:25.260]  Gavin, if you don't do this, I'll be disappointed in you.
[37:25.260 --> 37:26.520]  It's also just a keypad.
[37:27.180 --> 37:28.560]  Wait, where's the lock?
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.100]  Oh, my God.
[37:30.380 --> 37:32.700]  Look at how much is involved in this thing.
[37:34.160 --> 37:35.100]  Oh, Jesus.
[37:36.160 --> 37:38.760]  I would need a fridge as big as Geoff's to use this thing.
[37:39.700 --> 37:41.280]  You're supposed to...
[37:42.200 --> 37:44.400]  Fuck, that looks like...
[37:45.480 --> 37:46.320]  That's crazy.
[37:46.880 --> 37:49.820]  Well, I mean, I've gone on and on on the on the other podcast
[37:49.820 --> 37:53.880]  about how the cold mailbox is the future, and that always seems to be shut down.
[37:54.180 --> 37:54.760]  But I think.
[37:55.660 --> 37:56.780]  I think this is perfect.
[37:56.880 --> 37:59.320]  I think the cold mailbox would really help out my bubbly situation.
[37:59.520 --> 38:01.380]  That looks like a complete operation.
[38:01.740 --> 38:02.820]  It's like a mag lock.
[38:03.280 --> 38:06.940]  Yeah, that looks like the shit you take out of a bag when you're breaking into a bag.
[38:09.220 --> 38:10.320]  God damn, dude.
[38:10.320 --> 38:16.000]  If you can successfully install the secure refrig dot com
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.460]  two door lock thing, Gavin, you will have.
[38:19.660 --> 38:22.460]  I will I will never doubt you again for the rest of your life.
[38:22.540 --> 38:24.120]  You'll have all of my respect forever.
[38:24.960 --> 38:29.500]  Why do you think they've called it the secure frig and not just the secure fridge?
[38:29.960 --> 38:30.760]  I don't know.
[38:31.040 --> 38:31.580]  Refrig?
[38:32.480 --> 38:33.600]  Refrig, refrig.
[38:34.520 --> 38:35.420]  Fridge heist.
[38:35.580 --> 38:36.100]  That's funnier.
[38:37.040 --> 38:38.480]  The domain was available.
[38:39.240 --> 38:43.220]  Yeah, the secure refrig is something totally different.
[38:46.420 --> 38:47.480]  What else would you want on the porch?
[38:47.760 --> 38:48.840]  What, with me with my water?
[38:49.180 --> 38:50.380]  Yeah, like, well, what's the next?
[38:50.500 --> 38:51.400]  Is it just a fridge?
[38:51.480 --> 38:56.440]  Like, I think once you open your your your porch to this scenario,
[38:57.040 --> 38:59.040]  there have to be other things that are other conveniences.
[38:59.780 --> 39:00.480]  Maybe that's it.
[39:01.360 --> 39:05.320]  Well, maybe I'd keep cereal and milk for being a cereal on the porch guy.
[39:06.280 --> 39:09.480]  You should have like a basket to put cucumbers into.
[39:10.940 --> 39:12.040]  Cucumber deposit basket.
[39:12.580 --> 39:15.880]  And then you can transfer them to the fridge, keep them fresh.
[39:17.140 --> 39:18.620]  Or maybe people just want a fridge.
[39:18.980 --> 39:20.800]  What have you because your fridge is locked up?
[39:20.880 --> 39:24.220]  What if there's like a deposit box on the side of the fridge that you install?
[39:24.440 --> 39:27.260]  So like when you like on a Friday, when you want to deposit a check,
[39:27.460 --> 39:30.820]  you just like deposit your neighbor can deposit cucumbers directly into your fridge
[39:30.820 --> 39:31.580]  without being able to.
[39:31.680 --> 39:34.860]  It's like when you donate when you donate clothes to one of the big bins.
[39:35.760 --> 39:39.120]  Or if you want something for, you know, how like Little Caesars
[39:39.120 --> 39:42.500]  during the pandemic, they introduce like those lockbox pizza things
[39:42.500 --> 39:45.900]  or like you go in and you know their combination in and then you can pull
[39:45.900 --> 39:46.500]  the pizza out.
[39:46.880 --> 39:50.220]  What if you did that with your like you ordered delivery pizza
[39:50.220 --> 39:54.660]  and give them instructions to put it in your fridge for later so you can enjoy it?
[39:55.040 --> 39:55.940]  You don't have to have it then.
[39:56.260 --> 39:56.860]  You can pre-plan.
[39:57.440 --> 39:59.900]  If they didn't call that thing the hot slot, I'm going to be pissed.
[40:04.260 --> 40:06.500]  I don't, I don't remember what it is.
[40:07.240 --> 40:08.540]  Yeah, I think you're going to be angry.
[40:08.860 --> 40:10.580]  What was the Little Caesars thing called?
[40:11.680 --> 40:12.900]  We we just did.
[40:13.020 --> 40:13.940]  We just went there last week.
[40:14.120 --> 40:15.480]  I'll have to ask Emily what it was called.
[40:15.640 --> 40:16.080]  I can't remember.
[40:16.620 --> 40:19.380]  I'm just looking up Caesars lockbox.
[40:19.740 --> 40:21.380]  Dude, people are sleeping on Little Caesars.
[40:21.560 --> 40:23.460]  It's I like it, but it's fucking good.
[40:23.540 --> 40:24.940]  I like Little Caesars. It's totally fine.
[40:25.320 --> 40:25.980]  Pizza, pizza.
[40:27.520 --> 40:30.520]  It's a budget pizza, but it's a solid budget pizza.
[40:30.800 --> 40:32.020]  It is a solid budget pizza.
[40:32.540 --> 40:34.460]  I have a fun fact actually relating to this.
[40:34.540 --> 40:35.280]  We could tie this all in.
[40:35.280 --> 40:40.140]  I was thinking about the insecurity of Burger King by title.
[40:41.380 --> 40:44.480]  Like every I was thinking all the other fast food names are grounded
[40:44.480 --> 40:48.860]  in some either reality or like fact related to the brand.
[40:49.180 --> 40:53.340]  So like Subway, I could translate into subs your way.
[40:53.380 --> 40:54.800]  Like that's that's what they offer.
[40:54.920 --> 40:56.520]  You make subs, you pick it out.
[40:57.040 --> 41:00.360]  McDonald's is the name of the founder, you know, like KFC.
[41:00.560 --> 41:02.700]  I feel like it's pretty self-explanatory for what their thing is.
[41:02.700 --> 41:07.280]  And Burger King is we have the best burgers or great burgers.
[41:07.540 --> 41:09.660]  That's like that's we can do that.
[41:09.740 --> 41:10.580]  We're the best.
[41:10.960 --> 41:13.200]  Is he the longest reigning monarch?
[41:13.520 --> 41:15.640]  I think so. Well, what about Dairy Queen?
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.520]  Was Dairy Queen before Burger King or after?
[41:18.920 --> 41:20.340]  Well, let's find out.
[41:20.360 --> 41:24.100]  So wait, the reason it's called Subway is because of subs your way.
[41:24.380 --> 41:25.980]  Oh, that's just what I could take from it.
[41:26.060 --> 41:28.580]  I actually didn't do research on why Subway is called Subway.
[41:28.760 --> 41:31.000]  That might not be factual, but it makes sense.
[41:31.000 --> 41:34.220]  Pun on submarine sandwich Subway.
[41:34.320 --> 41:36.900]  It's probably multiple layers.
[41:37.080 --> 41:38.180]  A sub your way.
[41:39.060 --> 41:40.660]  I should have looked into Subway as a bad thing.
[41:40.780 --> 41:44.800]  I looked into a bunch of other places, but that's what led me to this fun fact.
[41:45.100 --> 41:49.780]  OK, Dairy Queen is 14 years older than Burger King.
[41:49.840 --> 41:52.580]  So Dairy Queen's reign is has been a decade and a half long.
[41:52.620 --> 41:54.340]  It's the longest running monarch.
[41:54.860 --> 41:58.540]  Dairy Queen's reign was longer than the real queen.
[41:58.540 --> 42:01.660]  Yeah, wait, when when was the coronation?
[42:02.980 --> 42:05.580]  When I feel like you're the most qualified to know this.
[42:06.100 --> 42:06.960]  Yeah, right.
[42:09.940 --> 42:10.500]  1953.
[42:11.200 --> 42:12.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[42:12.360 --> 42:14.740]  Burger Queen or Burger King.
[42:14.820 --> 42:17.240]  Dairy Queen started Burger Queen.
[42:17.660 --> 42:19.220]  Burger Queen Elizabeth.
[42:19.940 --> 42:24.120]  When I was in Kuwait back in anyway, Dairy Queen started in 1940.
[42:24.200 --> 42:28.020]  When I was in Kuwait back in the army in the mid 90s, they had
[42:28.020 --> 42:29.340]  like a McDonald's.
[42:29.400 --> 42:30.940]  It was actually the nicest McDonald's you've ever seen.
[42:31.040 --> 42:31.840]  It's like two stories.
[42:32.340 --> 42:34.540]  And like dudes would be washing your car when you went in.
[42:34.600 --> 42:35.660]  It was fucking ridiculous.
[42:35.880 --> 42:39.000]  But they had they had a lot of American restaurants then.
[42:39.180 --> 42:42.980]  But the only one they had that was, I guess, not licensed was Burger King.
[42:43.140 --> 42:44.360]  And so they had Burger Queen.
[42:45.980 --> 42:46.940]  They have a cool logo.
[42:47.260 --> 42:48.780]  I don't remember it being any different.
[42:49.080 --> 42:50.860]  I just remember laughing every time I saw it.
[42:52.480 --> 42:56.180]  Give us see like a headline that is beyond your comprehension.
[42:56.180 --> 42:59.720]  I feel like a lot of the time I'll read a headline, but it's about like.
[43:01.100 --> 43:06.180]  Something I don't understand, like an NFT related thing or something that's just like I haven't been up to date with.
[43:06.580 --> 43:13.020]  I had the opposite of that happen when I read a headline that said Conan trusted AI and did a cameo.
[43:13.080 --> 43:14.120]  And in my head, I thought.
[43:15.260 --> 43:16.840]  He's using AI.
[43:17.780 --> 43:20.720]  To like generate cameos for people.
[43:21.840 --> 43:25.100]  Which I thought was interesting, and then I read the actual article.
[43:25.660 --> 43:28.740]  What it actually said was Conan trusted Al and did a cameo.
[43:28.840 --> 43:30.580]  He was talking about doing a cameo in the Weird Al movie.
[43:30.960 --> 43:32.480]  And I was just like way too ahead of.
[43:33.380 --> 43:35.500]  It was the opposite of being out of touch.
[43:35.620 --> 43:36.720]  I was like too in touch.
[43:38.080 --> 43:39.120]  Oh, the Burger Queen.
[43:39.580 --> 43:40.780]  Yeah, I found it. I found a photo.
[43:41.560 --> 43:42.200]  Oh, wow.
[43:42.560 --> 43:43.280]  That looks great.
[43:43.660 --> 43:44.200]  That's legit.
[43:45.780 --> 43:46.580]  I'm glad I read.
[43:46.880 --> 43:47.400]  I'm glad I didn't.
[43:50.620 --> 43:54.740]  When you get when you get to be like four, when you get to be my age, you start to you can't trust your memory.
[43:55.100 --> 43:57.040]  You would just invent shit all the time.
[43:58.100 --> 43:59.020]  Well, you could've dreamt it.
[43:59.440 --> 44:04.220]  Yeah, or like you misremember something and then you've had 20 years to misremember it, you know?
[44:05.280 --> 44:06.080]  Yeah, absolutely.
[44:06.740 --> 44:08.100]  I mean, that just happens with time.
[44:08.140 --> 44:09.280]  I feel like with most stories.
[44:10.200 --> 44:17.260]  Like it's hard to remember exactly the specifics of it, but when I was looking through fast food names, I was like, what about Popeye's?
[44:17.760 --> 44:21.980]  Popeye's feels like there might be I could see like whoever created it had a nickname that was Popeye.
[44:22.060 --> 44:24.820]  Like there could be a fun thing with Popeye's.
[44:25.100 --> 44:29.660]  Popeye's was originally called Chicken on the Run and nobody liked it.
[44:29.760 --> 44:30.960]  Nobody, nobody went there.
[44:31.060 --> 44:31.960]  It was a shitty name.
[44:32.540 --> 44:37.980]  And then the guy watched the French Connection and renamed the restaurant after Gene Hackman because he was cool.
[44:38.440 --> 44:40.160]  Yeah, Popeye's was his name.
[44:40.340 --> 44:44.440]  I had no idea that that was the French Connection is responsible for Popeye's.
[44:44.840 --> 44:46.660]  As I actually know about.
[44:47.700 --> 44:50.780]  So I asked in the box just renaming to Scorpion King.
[44:51.300 --> 44:55.360]  It was what he watched the movie and was like, that's a cool name.
[44:55.500 --> 44:56.480]  Popeye's is cool.
[44:56.660 --> 44:58.800]  I'm going to name it after Gene Hackman.
[44:58.960 --> 45:02.720]  I think I actually I know about this because of Face Jam.
[45:02.960 --> 45:04.720]  I think they covered this early on.
[45:04.840 --> 45:05.980]  I assume Eric would know.
[45:06.120 --> 45:06.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:06.760 --> 45:09.960]  We did. And then he denied up and down that it was because of that.
[45:10.000 --> 45:16.440]  And everyone went, yeah, but he was like, well, it's it's after the cartoon character.
[45:16.440 --> 45:20.060]  He's like, no, no, it's a Gene Hackman's character.
[45:21.240 --> 45:24.120]  The French Connection and everyone doesn't make any sense.
[45:24.120 --> 45:24.900]  And he went right.
[45:26.180 --> 45:28.200]  That was it. There you go.
[45:29.640 --> 45:30.500]  That's fantastic.
[45:30.760 --> 45:36.560]  Speaking of dumb names, have we ever talked about where the NBA G League got its name?
[45:37.080 --> 45:43.720]  No. So the NBA G League, if you don't know, is the minor leagues of the NBA.
[45:43.880 --> 45:45.000]  It's like their farm teams, right?
[45:45.220 --> 45:50.580]  Yeah. Like for Boston Celtics have the Maine Red Claws, although I think they changed their name to the Maine Celtics,
[45:50.580 --> 45:52.660]  which is lame because the Red Claws is a much cooler name.
[45:53.200 --> 45:55.620]  And they have like a little lobster logo.
[45:56.300 --> 45:58.820]  The NBA G League got its name.
[45:58.920 --> 46:00.100]  It used to be called the D League.
[46:00.240 --> 46:01.240]  D stands for development.
[46:01.560 --> 46:02.300]  The Development League.
[46:02.480 --> 46:04.140]  They changed their name to G.
[46:04.380 --> 46:06.200]  Would anyone like to throw out a guess why?
[46:06.560 --> 46:07.560]  I have no idea.
[46:08.000 --> 46:09.280]  Gatorade paid them to.
[46:09.680 --> 46:11.880]  It's the it's the NBA Gatorade League.
[46:12.400 --> 46:13.620]  What? What?
[46:13.780 --> 46:14.820]  Shitty advertising.
[46:14.820 --> 46:22.000]  Yeah. Gatorade just came to it and said, essentially renamed the D League to the G League and we'll give you money.
[46:22.160 --> 46:23.600]  And the NBA was like, cha-ching.
[46:24.060 --> 46:25.340]  Is it at least in their font?
[46:26.260 --> 46:27.380]  How are you supposed to know that?
[46:27.660 --> 46:29.360]  Yeah, I don't think they I don't know.
[46:30.220 --> 46:31.080]  The G League.
[46:31.800 --> 46:33.300]  Hmm. That is really weird.
[46:33.320 --> 46:35.380]  And they're trying to make the G League a bigger thing, right?
[46:35.400 --> 46:40.940]  Like they're trying to sign what would be college like players to it before they're draft eligible.
[46:41.800 --> 46:47.520]  It just seems like a bad investment because nobody really cares about the G League at this stage of like what it is.
[46:47.680 --> 46:50.480]  Well, it's it's becoming it's going to be.
[46:51.500 --> 46:57.400]  Just as viable of an avenue to the NBA as college, if not more so in the next 10 years, probably.
[46:57.880 --> 47:00.000]  Yeah, that's definitely the investment they're moving towards.
[47:00.080 --> 47:02.700]  But I wonder when did it switch to the G League?
[47:03.020 --> 47:04.520]  How long has it been the G League?
[47:04.520 --> 47:06.820]  Uh, let's see.
[47:07.400 --> 47:12.420]  2017, the D League signed entered into a multi-year partnership with Gatorade
[47:12.420 --> 47:15.840]  and announced that it would rebrand as the NBA Gatorade League,
[47:15.940 --> 47:19.000]  which was officially shortened to NBA G League prior to the season.
[47:19.060 --> 47:20.100]  So since 2017.
[47:20.620 --> 47:23.980]  I wish that this was adopted by other things,
[47:23.980 --> 47:27.060]  like in the same way that we sell arena names.
[47:27.180 --> 47:29.260]  Why don't you just sell the name of your sport?
[47:29.800 --> 47:32.620]  Why couldn't it be the NHL G for five years?
[47:32.620 --> 47:34.840]  Like what? It's there's no limit to this.
[47:35.220 --> 47:39.000]  The NFL G. Yeah, it's interesting, too, like because the
[47:39.620 --> 47:42.560]  the G League is a product and it's sponsored by a different product.
[47:42.640 --> 47:48.780]  So like. Ideally, if you follow this down the line far enough,
[47:48.800 --> 47:52.060]  could you eventually have like like could you have Pepsi sponsoring Coke?
[47:52.140 --> 47:58.580]  It'd be like the Pepsi Pepsi Coca-Cola or like the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics.
[47:59.640 --> 48:00.960]  There's really no different.
[48:00.960 --> 48:04.180]  Now, how much money would it take to change the name of the sport?
[48:06.060 --> 48:06.920]  How much Gatorade Ball?
[48:07.060 --> 48:08.320]  The G League? Yeah, like G-Ball.
[48:09.720 --> 48:10.440]  That's interesting.
[48:11.320 --> 48:12.580]  Well, hold on a second. Let me see.
[48:12.860 --> 48:14.140]  The new select contracts and alternative.
[48:14.340 --> 48:17.340]  Oh, no, it doesn't it doesn't talk about those kinds of things here on Wikipedia.
[48:18.820 --> 48:21.880]  I feel like the XFL is writing all these ideas down.
[48:24.840 --> 48:27.000]  The Rock's trying to figure out how to incorporate his Rock
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.440]  Not Rock draft into the next season.
[48:31.440 --> 48:35.440]  Eric sent a thing about how the Rock's tequila was the official tequila
[48:35.440 --> 48:37.940]  sponsor of the XFL. So smart.
[48:40.160 --> 48:43.060]  It's it's his. We can just do that.
[48:43.560 --> 48:46.040]  Like, yeah, Gavin, I think that would just be like
[48:46.040 --> 48:49.140]  and our official slow-mo partner is slow-mo, guys.
[48:49.380 --> 48:53.040]  Like it's just it's just the other thing you do.
[48:53.420 --> 48:54.940]  It's great. It's genius.
[48:55.980 --> 49:00.020]  Would you be hurt, Gavin, if our slow-mo partner was somebody else?
[49:00.760 --> 49:06.100]  Official exclusive slow-mo podcast in a partnership between
[49:06.100 --> 49:08.960]  in a partnership between the slow-mo guys and Anma.
[49:09.100 --> 49:14.460]  They have partnered together to sponsor F*** Face for the year 2023-2024 podcast season.
[49:16.380 --> 49:19.700]  We had to let Variety know, we gotta get this written up.
[49:21.420 --> 49:23.740]  They won't they won't ever cover us.
[49:24.820 --> 49:26.240]  We never got to the bottom of that.
[49:26.680 --> 49:29.260]  We didn't. No, but I decided to just let it go.
[49:30.120 --> 49:33.480]  We did. There's another thing recently that made me laugh.
[49:34.180 --> 49:37.020]  We'll never know if the cock block came from inside the house or not.
[49:41.100 --> 49:43.440]  Why don't we put a bounty on it internally?
[49:46.860 --> 49:47.820]  Email everyone.
[49:49.320 --> 49:51.220]  I feel like this would be easy to figure out.
[49:51.520 --> 49:52.500]  Start hearing some names.
[49:52.760 --> 49:54.800]  I'm a f***ing die. Oh, my God.
[49:55.080 --> 49:57.720]  That could be our first true crime podcast subject.
[50:00.020 --> 50:01.140]  The cock was blocked.
[50:02.680 --> 50:07.020]  And we could follow up that hit with the doorbell caper.
[50:10.060 --> 50:14.060]  There was a recent docket that was like a company brand thing
[50:14.560 --> 50:19.660]  I thought was funny that Shrek, Shrek and the Predator made it in, but we did not.
[50:20.280 --> 50:21.600]  We were there is no reference.
[50:21.920 --> 50:22.780]  There might have been one.
[50:23.020 --> 50:23.900]  I don't think there was, though.
[50:23.940 --> 50:26.440]  There was a block of it that was like everything the company does.
[50:26.600 --> 50:28.120]  And we were not part of it.
[50:28.120 --> 50:29.080]  That made me laugh.
[50:29.780 --> 50:30.540]  What do you mean?
[50:31.220 --> 50:35.180]  Well, there was it was like a doc thing that was recent for the company of like,
[50:35.300 --> 50:38.580]  this is our brand and the Predator made it and Shrek made it, but we did not.
[50:38.720 --> 50:40.380]  We were not mentioned in the list of things.
[50:40.780 --> 50:45.960]  Well, I don't know that we are as strong of a brand as Predator or Shrek.
[50:46.300 --> 50:47.320]  No, we're definitely not.
[50:47.400 --> 50:50.720]  I'm not saying we are, but I'm just saying when you're discussing every inch
[50:50.720 --> 50:52.480]  of the company, right? Oh, yeah, yeah.
[50:52.580 --> 50:55.220]  Also, the Predator made it and Shrek made it.
[50:55.220 --> 50:56.880]  But we we were omitted.
[50:56.880 --> 50:58.800]  We're even internally blocked.
[50:59.320 --> 51:00.740]  Did Rooster Teeth stuff make it?
[51:01.560 --> 51:02.780]  Yeah, it was a Rooster Teeth thing.
[51:02.880 --> 51:05.880]  It was them talking about stuff that the company does.
[51:06.200 --> 51:07.920]  It was like we were not in our docket.
[51:08.260 --> 51:09.340]  It was just a silly thing.
[51:09.700 --> 51:12.280]  But to be fair, would you mention us?
[51:13.040 --> 51:15.540]  I don't even tell people what I do, like when they stop me on the street
[51:15.540 --> 51:16.920]  and they're like, oh, hey, Geoff, how are you doing, man?
[51:17.320 --> 51:18.340]  What are you up to these days?
[51:18.340 --> 51:19.320]  I'm like, I don't know.
[51:19.760 --> 51:21.920]  Well, that's yeah, you're making the business cards to solve this problem.
[51:22.540 --> 51:23.620]  It's not a thing of blame.
[51:23.660 --> 51:24.660]  It is very difficult.
[51:25.020 --> 51:26.100]  I don't know how to.
[51:26.500 --> 51:30.600]  We've talked before, like describing what it is is definitely a challenge.
[51:31.080 --> 51:31.820]  It's just it's funny.
[51:32.040 --> 51:33.480]  It's like so hard. It's omitted.
[51:34.100 --> 51:37.200]  Somebody I saw the other day said that they thought a good tagline,
[51:37.400 --> 51:42.060]  a better tagline than deep lore about nothing, which and I'm not advocating
[51:42.060 --> 51:44.780]  for this, I just thought it was interesting, was that I think Gavin,
[51:44.960 --> 51:46.880]  somebody said in a recent episode, I think it was Gavin,
[51:47.120 --> 51:48.520]  that we make games out of everything.
[51:49.160 --> 51:50.780]  That is kind of that's kind of true.
[51:51.120 --> 51:53.620]  That is kind of a way to describe this, I would say.
[51:54.160 --> 51:55.880]  What about face versus predator?
[51:57.320 --> 52:01.740]  Oh, go change the name of the podcast face versus predator.
[52:03.520 --> 52:05.220]  I like that.
[52:08.300 --> 52:10.120]  I like that.
[52:11.120 --> 52:13.580]  I'm imagining not us.
[52:13.760 --> 52:17.720]  That's like what you know, like on YouTube, you see those backyard fights
[52:17.720 --> 52:20.400]  like those are the names of the people in the backyard fight.
[52:20.420 --> 52:21.840]  It's fake versus predator.
[52:21.840 --> 52:23.180]  Those are the two guys.
[52:25.720 --> 52:28.920]  I'm OK with us changing the name of this or doing a face
[52:28.920 --> 52:33.760]  per predator story if it ends with us locking the predator in Gavin's fridge.
[52:33.960 --> 52:35.300]  His porch fridge.
[52:35.940 --> 52:38.260]  We lure him into the fridge with cucumbers.
[52:42.940 --> 52:44.320]  I have a slight mystery.
[52:45.020 --> 52:48.060]  This is I'm talking about true crime and things.
[52:48.480 --> 52:50.220]  I had a weird experience. OK.
[52:50.980 --> 52:53.520]  I've been recently talking a lot about rock stuff.
[52:55.880 --> 52:57.380]  That's not a normal sentence.
[52:57.520 --> 52:59.380]  You complete freak.
[53:00.800 --> 53:02.260]  We're talking about rock stuff.
[53:02.400 --> 53:04.040]  You're about to say an insane shit.
[53:04.160 --> 53:05.340]  It's perfectly normal.
[53:05.720 --> 53:08.600]  Well, we were. What was wrong with you?
[53:08.940 --> 53:10.880]  No, calm down.
[53:11.320 --> 53:13.620]  First of all, that's what I said.
[53:13.680 --> 53:14.160]  Not true.
[53:14.660 --> 53:15.860]  We've been talking a lot of rock.
[53:16.300 --> 53:17.480]  We were talking a lot of rock recently.
[53:17.960 --> 53:18.960]  It's perfectly true.
[53:18.960 --> 53:21.780]  That's what's so confusing about this.
[53:21.940 --> 53:25.040]  Oh, speaking of rocks, let me transition again very quickly.
[53:25.160 --> 53:27.360]  Gavin, I need to apologize to you
[53:28.260 --> 53:31.320]  because I after you called me out on it, we talked about it.
[53:31.480 --> 53:34.900]  I went back last night and I watched the bean hole video
[53:34.900 --> 53:39.220]  and I watched the baseball video and I definitely did not watch either of those.
[53:39.520 --> 53:40.400]  Those were great.
[53:40.940 --> 53:44.780]  Watching you guys deal with that rock, the full cut of it, mixing the beans.
[53:45.560 --> 53:46.260]  It was very good.
[53:46.500 --> 53:47.200]  I would highly recommend.
[53:47.560 --> 53:48.300]  I had a great time.
[53:48.300 --> 53:49.300]  It's a great video.
[53:49.320 --> 53:51.520]  That was a year ago.
[53:51.720 --> 53:52.760]  When was it made?
[53:53.320 --> 53:55.360]  I don't I don't know how I did.
[53:55.760 --> 53:56.320]  When was baseballs filmed?
[53:56.740 --> 53:59.680]  That was last like March or something.
[54:00.320 --> 54:02.320]  I don't I don't know.
[54:02.520 --> 54:04.860]  I thought I watched them and I just never did.
[54:05.220 --> 54:06.060]  And I did baseball.
[54:06.460 --> 54:09.100]  It was like July of last year.
[54:09.120 --> 54:10.700]  I want to say that baseballs came out.
[54:11.640 --> 54:12.560]  I did look at the date.
[54:12.700 --> 54:15.860]  I was like, did something happen where I like I missed it because that
[54:15.860 --> 54:17.340]  and I couldn't I couldn't think anything.
[54:17.340 --> 54:18.740]  So I apologize.
[54:19.200 --> 54:19.980]  I should have watched those.
[54:20.100 --> 54:20.980]  People should watch those.
[54:21.060 --> 54:21.900]  Those are great videos.
[54:22.360 --> 54:25.160]  March 20th 2022.
[54:25.940 --> 54:26.720]  March 20th.
[54:27.800 --> 54:30.140]  Your takeaway is people should watch them.
[54:30.520 --> 54:31.120]  Yeah. Yeah.
[54:31.120 --> 54:35.060]  If you're if you're like me, you thought that you saw them,
[54:35.220 --> 54:36.520]  but you actually didn't.
[54:36.560 --> 54:40.820]  Maybe double check because I was watching it and going, I've seen this.
[54:40.880 --> 54:43.360]  And then I'd go, I don't think I've seen this.
[54:43.560 --> 54:45.820]  And then we got to the part where they season the beans.
[54:45.900 --> 54:47.320]  And I was like, I haven't seen any of this.
[54:47.320 --> 54:48.860]  This is all this recording.
[54:49.080 --> 54:52.540]  Both of those videos were filmed one year and three days ago.
[54:53.680 --> 54:54.560]  Wow. Wow.
[54:54.840 --> 54:55.520]  That's a coincidence.
[54:55.720 --> 54:56.400]  Well, it's a perfect time.
[54:57.040 --> 54:59.320]  That's actually leads me to a second point.
[54:59.640 --> 55:01.260]  You guys need to do the beanhole again.
[55:01.760 --> 55:04.660]  Whenever the anniversary is, which it sounds like was three days ago.
[55:05.100 --> 55:07.160]  There needs to be another beanhole.
[55:07.540 --> 55:10.240]  Well, I'm working on a on a different beanhole hole.
[55:10.360 --> 55:11.960]  I guess I'm working on a different beanhole.
[55:12.380 --> 55:16.140]  So I. Oh, you're making like incremental progress on a beanhole.
[55:16.140 --> 55:19.360]  I started on it a while back and I just haven't I haven't gotten back to it,
[55:19.420 --> 55:21.760]  but I'm about 40% of the way into the hole.
[55:22.180 --> 55:23.540]  That was one of my takeaways.
[55:23.660 --> 55:26.360]  And my other takeaway was you guys were talking about a treasure
[55:26.360 --> 55:28.780]  discovery business for Geoff's backyard.
[55:29.060 --> 55:32.780]  I would love it if you like if Gavin like closed his eyes,
[55:32.820 --> 55:36.680]  spun in your backyard, took a certain number of steps, and you just dug.
[55:37.140 --> 55:39.760]  You just dug for like six feet and saw what you found.
[55:40.500 --> 55:41.380]  It'd be a great series.
[55:42.540 --> 55:43.940]  How far down do we have to go?
[55:43.940 --> 55:45.420]  I think so. I love this idea.
[55:45.540 --> 55:49.360]  I think six feet straight, six feet straight down.
[55:49.940 --> 55:51.780]  Can we can we have a jackhammer?
[55:52.180 --> 55:54.600]  Yeah, you can have whatever you want, whatever tools you want to use.
[55:54.660 --> 55:56.100]  You use fucking dynamite. I don't care.
[55:56.200 --> 55:56.860]  It's not my yard.
[55:57.160 --> 55:58.880]  But you have to go six feet down.
[55:59.200 --> 56:00.760]  Can we credit card a jackhammer?
[56:03.540 --> 56:06.540]  Yes, I'm looking at stuff right now.
[56:06.600 --> 56:10.200]  I'm less worried about credit carding a jackhammer and more worried about what we hit.
[56:10.680 --> 56:13.480]  What about this? Can we credit card jack with a hammer?
[56:13.480 --> 56:16.380]  Is that is that a little bit more in the price range?
[56:16.580 --> 56:18.620]  That's probably going to be more expensive, but way less effective.
[56:19.400 --> 56:20.840]  Yeah, if it's more expensive.
[56:20.960 --> 56:22.740]  Yeah, undeniably less effective.
[56:22.840 --> 56:23.920]  I was hoping for cost.
[56:24.940 --> 56:25.780]  Budget jackhammer.
[56:26.020 --> 56:29.140]  I bet you'll hit like an old VW bug or something if you go.
[56:29.240 --> 56:30.280]  I would love to see it.
[56:30.500 --> 56:36.280]  I love the ever expanding list of different cars that whatever Geoff describes.
[56:37.340 --> 56:40.260]  I was digging down. I hit the hood of a Buick.
[56:40.260 --> 56:46.700]  I'm just trying to make a compilation of all the kind of car
[56:46.700 --> 56:51.240]  the people that would do what they did to the backyard would own and then not value.
[56:51.660 --> 56:55.480]  And I think last time you said you said like fifty two Buick.
[56:55.540 --> 56:56.900]  It's always got a year to it as well.
[56:58.100 --> 56:59.460]  Well, I like to add a little flavor.
[56:59.880 --> 57:00.940]  I want Geoff to be right.
[57:01.180 --> 57:04.300]  I want you to go six feet deep and find all of these cars.
[57:04.520 --> 57:05.580]  Like you just called it.
[57:05.620 --> 57:07.200]  Every single one was accurate.
[57:07.540 --> 57:09.720]  But my car, my house was built on a car graveyard.
[57:09.720 --> 57:11.740]  Yeah, yeah.
[57:11.740 --> 57:14.760]  Is there is there a spot of your yard, Geoff, that we can absolutely annihilate?
[57:15.160 --> 57:16.520]  Yeah, 100 percent.
[57:16.660 --> 57:18.380]  If I do enough of them, we can just put a pool in.
[57:19.220 --> 57:21.380]  That's true. Yeah, that's an even better point.
[57:21.560 --> 57:22.460]  Yeah. Yeah.
[57:22.480 --> 57:23.500]  We can definitely jack.
[57:23.500 --> 57:25.360]  We can definitely jackhammer in my backyard.
[57:25.680 --> 57:27.580]  That'll give it. That'll be good supplemental content.
[57:28.120 --> 57:29.460]  Yeah. I wonder how deep we could go.
[57:29.860 --> 57:30.980]  I'd be fun to find out.
[57:31.240 --> 57:32.300]  Six feet is a good number.
[57:32.460 --> 57:34.020]  It's the classic depth. Yeah.
[57:34.040 --> 57:35.120]  When it comes to digging holes.
[57:35.880 --> 57:37.440]  But what if we went like 20 feet?
[57:37.780 --> 57:39.440]  You can't do you're not going 20 feet.
[57:39.440 --> 57:41.780]  Why? We got a jackhammer.
[57:42.100 --> 57:46.520]  Because I just watched in a video of you guys failing to go more than one foot.
[57:48.360 --> 57:49.980]  It's going to take six years.
[57:51.080 --> 57:52.560]  What tools are you getting?
[57:52.700 --> 57:55.380]  Are you getting like, are you bringing in construction equipment
[57:55.380 --> 57:58.060]  or is it just stuff that you can pull from Geoff's shed?
[57:58.620 --> 58:00.420]  Well, is there going to be a rock that we eventually hit
[58:00.420 --> 58:01.760]  that a jackhammer won't crack?
[58:02.280 --> 58:05.640]  Well, OK, so you're just definitely assuming you have a jackhammer
[58:05.640 --> 58:06.320]  in this scenario.
[58:06.920 --> 58:08.620]  Yeah. What won't jack crack?
[58:09.460 --> 58:11.660]  I don't know what jack can't crack.
[58:12.500 --> 58:16.720]  Can you even use a jack in the ground like that?
[58:16.800 --> 58:17.480]  What? What do you mean?
[58:17.560 --> 58:18.740]  They used to. Yeah. What do you mean?
[58:21.720 --> 58:24.040]  No. First of all, if they did, they'd be very stealthy.
[58:24.200 --> 58:28.520]  Second of all, I feel like I see jackhammers on like kind of surface
[58:28.520 --> 58:29.320]  or near surface.
[58:29.580 --> 58:31.920]  I don't see jackhammers necessarily in mines.
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.980]  Not that I'm in mines all that often, but I don't feel like I see that there.
[58:36.420 --> 58:37.280]  Hmm. You might be right.
[58:37.560 --> 58:38.440]  That's probably a reason for that.
[58:38.440 --> 58:39.200]  Hmm.
[58:40.720 --> 58:42.100]  Well, we're going to need it for the rocks.
[58:42.260 --> 58:47.320]  Look at that. He the the amount of sass I got on Gavin on the introduction
[58:47.320 --> 58:51.300]  to that point to him to wrap around and go, hmm, he might be right.
[58:51.460 --> 58:52.360]  It was quite the journey.
[58:52.720 --> 58:54.400]  We went far both ways.
[58:55.040 --> 58:57.900]  I think it's just residual like foot revenge.
[58:58.260 --> 59:00.140]  No, I get it. Yeah, totally.
[59:01.020 --> 59:01.460]  Absolutely.
[59:01.660 --> 59:06.540]  When you brought up the in the the thing with the buying the smallest item thing,
[59:06.580 --> 59:08.120]  when you're like, I thought it'd be a two day thing.
[59:08.120 --> 59:09.840]  And I was like, no, it's ridiculous.
[59:10.080 --> 59:11.700]  It was like, no, that's totally valid.
[59:11.940 --> 59:15.320]  But it's sometimes you get in fights or you're just swinging at everything
[59:15.320 --> 59:17.020]  because you just you're you're prepared.
[59:17.140 --> 59:18.860]  You just got to bite down on the mouthpiece.
[59:19.280 --> 59:23.360]  That's most of our fights on this podcast to the point where it's like
[59:24.520 --> 59:26.640]  I'm yelling, literally yelling in my head.
[59:26.680 --> 59:28.460]  I'm like, why am I so passionate about this?
[59:28.760 --> 59:29.400]  I will say
[59:30.860 --> 59:32.520]  in my defense of that, though, I did.
[59:32.620 --> 59:33.820]  We agreed to buy it the next day.
[59:33.840 --> 59:34.980]  We don't need to go over this again.
[59:35.360 --> 59:36.340]  We did agree next day.
[59:36.340 --> 59:39.400]  So it'd be why would I anticipate it being a two day set up
[59:39.400 --> 59:40.880]  if we're buying it the next day?
[59:40.880 --> 59:44.120]  That's fair. Just posted a jackhammer in stock.
[59:44.300 --> 59:46.760]  That jackhammer I just showed you is in stock at Lowe's right now.
[59:46.780 --> 59:47.800]  That's such a wide bit.
[59:47.860 --> 59:50.640]  I feel like we'll need like a chisel bit to get through a lot of the.
[59:51.080 --> 59:52.220]  Yeah. Tougher rock.
[59:52.500 --> 59:53.800]  Yeah, we can get a different bit.
[59:53.920 --> 59:56.420]  Like we can get like a smaller chisel bit because you'll need it.
[59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.140]  But it'll be a lot of moving dirt.
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.780]  I mean, six feet is six feet of dirt.
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:03.680]  That's a lot of dirt.
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:04.740]  That's a lot of dirt.
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.860]  They want to go 20, 20 feet.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.980]  Can we get one on a 20 foot stick?
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:10.720]  What's that mean?
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:14.380]  Like like how Andrew has to play video games like on his.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.360]  Sticks like you want that for a jackhammer?
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:21.520]  Like if you could connect a pogo stick to the top of a jackhammer
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.780]  and then get on top of that, maybe.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.440]  I like the idea, just the pogo jackhammer in general.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:29.480]  That's great.
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:34.100]  It's kind of like that character in Plants vs.
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.480]  Zombies, right? Yeah.
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.860]  Garden Warfare. Yeah. Oh, totally.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.900]  The Engineer, whatever his name was.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:43.400]  So we're going to end up with a six foot hole in my backyard, right?
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:44.840]  Oh, at least. Yeah.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.180]  Why don't we we got to put something down there?
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.980]  Beans, deep beans.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.880]  Well, yeah, we got six feet of beans.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.560]  Yeah, but I mean, we should put something down there
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.540]  that's going to live there forever.
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:00.740]  You fill it up with like water, that could be your pool.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.540]  Yeah. You seem not into the idea.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:10.420]  Did I ever tell you guys about one time at my old house
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.900]  years and years and years ago?
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.480]  I I had a pipe break in my front yard
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.700]  and there's just like water bubbling out from under the ground
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.840]  in my front yard, right?
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.060]  And it was like weird.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.680]  So I had to call a plumber and the plumber had to come
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.820]  and dig a hole in my front yard.
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.560]  And he went about three or four feet down.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:37.180]  And before he found like where the pipe burst and in in the ground
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:40.740]  where he found the burst pipe, he found a laminated.
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.420]  Photo of a saint, and I think it was
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:49.980]  I want to say it was the hand of Fatima.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.560]  I don't remember what it was, but it was like a laminated, like religious card.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:59.760]  And it had been buried like three feet in the ground at some point.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.120]  And he was like, this is really weird, but this was right next to where your pipe
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.480]  burst. And so I kept it on my fridge for years and years.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:08.560]  It might still be there at that house, but I never figured out
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.420]  like who would bury a religious card underground.
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:15.160]  And it just happened to be at the exact spot where the pipe burst.
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:18.260]  Do you think it was buried or do you think it just blew in a hole
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.400]  that was dug in the past?
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:21.260]  He dug it out. It was there.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.000]  It was like laying next to the pipe.
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:26.580]  So you're saying you want to put a laminated Don Zimmer 20 feet deep in your yard?
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:29.000]  Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:29.820]  Thank you.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.880]  I think it'd be funny if there aren't car pieces down there,
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.140]  if you put car pieces down there that you feel should be there.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.860]  Oh, let's buy a 56 Buick.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:48.640]  It was St. Marina, the patron saint of water.
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:49.640]  Yeah, that's what it was.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.120]  Really? And it was at the pipe, the water pipe.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.180]  Yeah, that is odd.
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:57.500]  Who would bury that?
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.860]  That feels, yeah.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.760]  Anyway, we definitely should put a Don Zimmer at the bottom.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:02.560]  I think that's a great idea.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.860]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:09.680]  What if we put a time capsule?
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.620]  Would it be insensitive to put a coolio?
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.140]  What if it's a USB stick of this recording?
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:16.260]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.180]  And then they have the history of why it's down there.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.560]  Yeah, that's a great idea, Gav.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:23.320]  Is there a saint of beans?
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.240]  Ha ha ha.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:25.860]  Let me look.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:26.920]  Saint of beans.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.480]  Saint Campbell?
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.380]  Uh, yes.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.200]  Maybe.
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:35.420]  Who's the bean saint?
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:36.860]  Saint Bean.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:37.960]  Oh.
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.140]  There's a Saint Bean?
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.760]  Is it Rowan Atkinson?
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:46.480]  Bowen of Mortlatch is the first of three known bishops of Mortlatch.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.560]  I think he gave me a quest in Skyrim.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.560]  Ha ha ha.
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:54.600]  Maybe we'll throw him down there, too.
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:55.340]  Ha ha ha.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:04:00.060]  I like the idea of doing a little time capsule that includes, like, a waterproof USB stick
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.180]  that has this recording on it.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.220]  I think that's fantastic.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.460]  And then that gives us a reason to hit six feet.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:11.200]  His name, which can also be written in non-Gaelic context as B-A-nus.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:12.900]  Ha ha ha.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.480]  B-O-A-nus.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.320]  Ha ha ha.
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:17.420]  So we're going to laminate B-O-A-nus.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.320]  Ha ha ha.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.660]  Ha ha ha.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.100]  Ha ha ha.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.200]  Ha ha ha.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:27.420]  Ha ha ha.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:28.340]  Ha ha ha.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:28.580]  Ha ha ha.
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.400]  I cannot trace the beginning of this conversation.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.720]  We're at B-O-A-nus, and I don't know how we got here.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.920]  It's like, if we could find a Saint who sounds like Butthead, we'd be in business.
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.640]  Ha ha ha.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:40.820]  Oh, man.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.240]  Oh, goddamn.
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.060]  That was really funny.
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:49.560]  Also, you guys might not realize this, congratulations on being the number one beanhole influencers
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.120]  on YouTube.
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:54.560]  I was just curious, you have the most, you have the number one beanhole video on YouTube.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.380]  You got that market.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.040]  It's locked down.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:56.300]  By viewers?
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:57.960]  By viewers, yes.
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:58.740]  Oh, man.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:04:59.820]  That's great to hear.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.780]  It's like some Mr. Bean clips, which I'm not counting, but as far as specific beanhole
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:06.860]  activities, you guys have it by quite a bit.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:12.180]  Uh, that's a, you know, that's a moniker I will wear proudly.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.080]  You should.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.120]  I'm jealous.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.320]  Should we change our bios to beanhole influencer?
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:17.460]  Ha ha ha.
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:18.660]  F*** face.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.120]  F*** face versus predator.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.360]  A beanhole influencer.
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:21.940]  Ha ha ha.
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:24.600]  Oh, man.
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.620]  We should probably wrap up.
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:26.860]  I will say.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:27.520]  That went so fast.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:28.160]  It did.
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:32.620]  Earlier today, y'all weren't there, but Eric and I did a F*** face presents opening day,
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:36.000]  which is where we sold the new jersey and the green baseball bat and the hat.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.160]  I think it's all sold out now.
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.500]  But it hung around for a while and then we gave cards away that we pulled.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:47.120]  So I pulled, I grabbed a bunch of like really like unique kind of non-sports cards this time.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.860]  We pulled from this box of Americana stuff.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:06:01.620]  We pulled a one of one printing plate of the of a photo of the very first, uh, uh, what
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:02.400]  do you Groundhog?
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:04.740]  Groundhog Day.
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:05.100]  Really?
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:06.560]  The very first Groundhog Day.
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:08.300]  The very first Groundhog Day.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:09.860]  The very first Groundhog Day.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.560]  Yeah, but did Groundhogs matter?
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.680]  Did Groundhogs matter before Groundhog Day?
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:18.500]  I would argue that Groundhog Day, that that Poxatawney Phil or whatever his name was, became
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:19.940]  the first Groundhog to ever matter.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:20.820]  No, I agree.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:20.840]  I agree.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.240]  Is Groundhog Day a real thing?
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.080]  Yeah.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.660]  What do you mean, is it a real thing?
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:29.620]  Like, they actually released a Groundhog and see if it looks up well?
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.560]  What are you talking about?
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:31.140]  Yes.
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:32.400]  I thought it was a movie.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.280]  No.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.400]  Based on a real thing.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:34.520]  Based on a real thing.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.180]  That's a real thing?
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:36.840]  Yeah.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.480]  You didn't...
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:38.920]  Oh, wow.
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:40.200]  We had very different experiences.
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:42.340]  I grew up thinking that this was scientific.
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:46.340]  I remember being a kid being like, the weather is determined on the Groundhog.
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:47.440]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.600]  We need to make a face field trip to Groundhog Day.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.940]  I've always wanted to go to Groundhog Day.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.720]  I feel like you're going to be disappointed by Groundhog Day.
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:57.240]  It's in the same town they filmed Groundhog Day, I think, isn't it?
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.880]  Wait, so it's like based... oh, I can't believe it.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:00.820]  Poxitani?
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.160]  That's incredible.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:05.660]  I love that you know this.
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:06.220]  That's blowing my mind.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:07.560]  That's an amazing thing.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.740]  Why would I think that's real?
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.460]  It's stupid.
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:16.760]  You just talked about St. Bean-anus and you're like, that's dumb.
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:17.640]  Why would it be real?
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:18.480]  You're like, that's stupid.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:22.060]  You come from a country where they have a sport that's rolling cheese down a hill.
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.220]  There's no movie about it.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:34.320]  Speaking of field trips, Eric told me earlier today that we can go to the Beanhole Days festival in July.
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:36.180]  July 12th and 13th, if you want.
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.860]  Do you think we'll get trapped in a time loop?
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.540]  A bean loop?
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:46.160]  I don't know whether I'd want to be trapped in a time loop at Groundhog Day or Beanhole Day.
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.720]  I would want to be a Beanhole Day.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:49.400]  Really?
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.480]  It depends.
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.100]  Are you guys making the beans or do you access other beans?
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:57.280]  I'm a bigger bean fan than a bigger Groundhog fan.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.700]  I don't give a shit about Groundhogs.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:04.160]  Do you think in an unseen time loop in Groundhog Day he went on just an absolute murder spree?
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:04.840]  Yes.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:05.960]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:06.820]  I think so too.
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:09.300]  I think he killed everybody he...
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.880]  Did you just want confirmation on that?
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:15.860]  I just think that's a much darker movie if you think about how long he's been in there.
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:18.860]  Have you ever seen that movie Happy Death Day?
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:19.900]  Yes.
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:22.580]  Yeah, that's like the horror version of Groundhog Day, right?
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:23.800]  Yeah, it's the same idea.
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:24.440]  Yeah.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:25.320]  Time loop movie.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:26.620]  It's a great movie.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:27.780]  The sequel is good too.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:28.360]  Not as good as the first one.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:28.960]  I haven't seen that.
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:29.480]  Really good.
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:30.640]  I need to see it.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.180]  What a show!
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:33.400]  We covered a lot of things.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:34.860]  Yeah, it was a good one.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:36.360]  Started strong.
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.340]  Great conversations at the beginning.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:39.480]  Didn't end well?
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.560]  No, I was making a joke.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:45.380]  You're the one that said you wanted to delete the beginning and restart it.
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.720]  Oh, right.
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.940]  It also has not ended well.
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:50.260]  Yeah.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.840]  I don't know how we would have done the preview for this one.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.640]  Like it coming up on ****face.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.200]  What I like about this is we started in the air and we ended in the ground.
[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:02.860]  We did a full arc, not on purpose.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:03.920]  But we did it.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:04.480]  We went there.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:05.820]  Oh, yeah.
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:14.560]  I'm just imagining like on the video of this podcast, there's just like an altitude.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.560]  And the numbers just slowly counting down.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.980]  People are like, what's going on?
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.560]  Until we're talking about digging.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:27.800]  It goes like sub zero feet to minus 20 feet.
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:32.420]  Back out to the height of a groundhog above a man's head.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.260]  I'd love somebody to draw that arc.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:38.260]  Visually.
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.140]  It was in the air, under the ground, back in the air again.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.100]  Oh, man.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.500]  This is all making my **** tooth hurt.
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:47.260]  I gotta go.
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:47.980]  No!
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:49.700]  Oh, dude.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:50.160]  It's brutal.
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:50.600]  Don't even.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:50.960]  No!
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.520]  I went to the dentist Monday morning.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.380]  I went to a separate dentist to get a second opinion.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.640]  Because I was in so much pain.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.140]  Oh, God.
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:01.540]  So it's not in your head.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.900]  I got x-rays, everything.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:03.740]  You know what that dentist said?
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:04.260]  What?
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:09.020]  He said, yeah, it'll probably hurt like this for about three weeks.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.280]  And then it won't anymore.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.700]  And if it does, just come back.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:14.000]  So I'm on the three-week cycle.
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:16.020]  My dentist is on vacation, so I can't talk to her.
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:19.820]  And this other dentist I went to for the second opinion was less helpful.
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:28.140]  So, yeah, I think I might experience grating pain for the rest of my life.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:32.160]  Did you notice in the animated thing of me talking about, hold on, Eric!
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:32.760]  Hold on!
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.120]  In the thing where...
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.920]  I saw him on mute and I had to go back.
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:44.320]  In the animated of me talking to my ringtone and talking to a recording of Dan.
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:49.080]  At the end of the animated thing, Geoff just looks at me and goes, I hate you so much.
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.720]  Without any of the context.
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:54.740]  He had toothache and laughing made his tooth hurt.
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:55.100]  Mouth hurt.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:55.440]  Yeah.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:57.920]  People are like, it's really aggressive.
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.160]  It's like you hate my story.
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:03.820]  Really? Why is Geoff mad at Gavin's story? It was really funny.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.960]  No, it made my mouth hurt.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.120]  Alright, now you can yell, Eric.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.300]  Yeah, go ahead, Eric.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.420]  I don't need to yell, I just need to wrap up.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:13.400]  That's a good point. We should definitely wrap up.
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:17.800]  Also, now that we're done and it's time for you to move on with your day as well.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:23.440]  Why don't you head on over to Rooster Teeth or YouTube and watch episode 4 of Does It Do?
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:29.200]  In this episode, Gavin and I make popsicles and then we vomit popsicles.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.560]  Good response to the first ep.
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:32.620]  Oh, the third one.
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:33.220]  They're great.
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:35.040]  Yeah, people seem to really like it.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:35.760]  Fantastic.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.620]  That's a great addition of having Kai and BK laughing in the background, I thought.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:46.200]  Oh yeah, they're the best. It really adds a Nick effect to it, I feel like.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:46.820]  Yeah.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:49.940]  Hey, audience. Not you guys.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:50.740]  Okay.

[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.120]  No, I think this is a good ending.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:06.900]  No, it's not.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:12.560]  I never brought up the rocks thing. I just brought up we were talking rocks. I never talked about the rocks.

[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:41.660]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of f***face.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.100]  No preview for this one. That Remax logo looks familiar.
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:46.800]  How do you hide from people?
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.800]  Someone made a video game about Pantin.
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:51.020]  Is Cheap Poison better or worse?
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:52.540]  Geoff has another mall story.
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:55.040]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:57.940]  All that and more on next week's episode of f***face.
