[00:00.000 --> 00:01.280]  You ever wonder why we're here?
[00:06.160 --> 00:08.000]  It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?
[00:19.340 --> 00:24.740]  5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3 o'clock. He was a second early.
[00:25.480 --> 00:25.960]  You're an idiot.
[00:26.460 --> 00:29.900]  It did look a little early. Not to get into a whole thing.
[00:30.240 --> 00:36.040]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. This is episode 151.
[00:36.340 --> 00:38.180]  My name is Geoffrey Rando.
[00:40.160 --> 00:41.280]  Rando? Geoffrey Rando?
[00:42.620 --> 00:44.340]  Can I do another take?
[00:44.620 --> 00:46.380]  Yeah, go ahead. You can do as many as you want.
[00:46.940 --> 00:49.200]  Are you gonna do a preview? There's no limit.
[00:49.420 --> 00:50.100]  No, no, no, no.
[00:50.520 --> 00:51.740]  Yeah, of course, that would be crazy.
[00:52.280 --> 00:54.240]  Well, now I've completely botched it in all ways.
[00:54.680 --> 01:00.620]  My name is Geoffrey Paul Wright, and with me is always Raymond Somer in Canada and Pat Gavindale from the UK.
[01:04.280 --> 01:05.880]  Raymond, Pat, how are you doing?
[01:06.340 --> 01:07.700]  I'm great, how are you?
[01:07.700 --> 01:13.520]  I'm good, I'm good. I used my birth name, the name I was born with, Geoffrey Paul Wright, just in case you didn't know that.
[01:13.760 --> 01:18.240]  I used to try and have, like, an alter ego character when I was at school. He was called Errol.
[01:18.760 --> 01:20.020]  Errol? Like Errol Flynn?
[01:20.480 --> 01:21.480]  He didn't have a last name.
[01:23.020 --> 01:28.220]  What was the point of Errol? Like, what did he do? What was the character? What was the alter ego? What was your thing?
[01:28.720 --> 01:30.700]  He was like me, but a bit cheeky.
[01:31.100 --> 01:33.700]  You know when you say...
[01:39.060 --> 01:52.280]  That feels really weird to make a whole alter ego for just a little bit cheeky. Like, I feel like there needs to be a wider change for an alter ego.
[01:52.280 --> 01:57.500]  I don't know, all my friends decided to do it. Like, I had a friend called Frank, and he was like, oh, that was a little bit of Herman there.
[01:59.480 --> 02:00.280]  That was...
[02:01.160 --> 02:08.500]  It would be like if I said I have an alter ego named The Flux, and the difference was I wore hats as The Flux. That was how you could tell.
[02:08.660 --> 02:12.540]  Like, it doesn't really matter. It's a slight difference. You probably came across the same.
[02:12.700 --> 02:15.660]  I was probably 13, though, so there's not a lot of logic behind it.
[02:16.380 --> 02:18.200]  Can I ask a question?
[02:18.740 --> 02:18.920]  Yeah.
[02:19.200 --> 02:27.140]  Andrew, you pulled the name The Flux out of thin air so quickly. It sounds like a name that you have been thinking about for a while.
[02:27.800 --> 02:29.600]  Did you just invent that off the top of your head?
[02:29.780 --> 02:33.240]  I did it off the top of my head. I went through, like, three other ones, and that one sounded the best.
[02:33.420 --> 02:34.180]  The Flux.
[02:35.340 --> 02:36.940]  Errol Flynn versus The Flux.
[02:39.040 --> 02:40.880]  We got superhero characters. We're set.
[02:41.540 --> 02:42.660]  Oh my god, that's funny.
[02:42.720 --> 02:45.080]  One is a bit cheeky, and the other wears hats.
[02:46.840 --> 02:48.540]  And is named The Something.
[02:51.800 --> 02:53.360]  It's like a superhero. What's your power?
[02:53.520 --> 02:54.220]  I have hats.
[02:54.220 --> 02:55.360]  I wear hats.
[02:55.540 --> 02:57.220]  I have a head that can fit a hat.
[02:57.980 --> 03:00.360]  I don't get sun in my eyes, so I can see better.
[03:01.600 --> 03:02.320]  Reduce sunburns.
[03:03.960 --> 03:05.440]  That was a weird start, wasn't it, that episode?
[03:05.620 --> 03:10.460]  That was a great start. I can't believe that's maybe the biggest reveal to begin an episode.
[03:10.640 --> 03:11.380]  Yeah, that's a big one.
[03:12.220 --> 03:16.000]  Have you ever told anybody that? Has that ever been in any other piece of content that you can remember?
[03:17.620 --> 03:17.980]  Errol?
[03:18.300 --> 03:19.940]  No, I don't think I've ever mentioned that.
[03:19.980 --> 03:20.760]  Errol Free.
[03:20.760 --> 03:25.800]  I once tried to convince Michael that my birth name was Cedric, but he didn't go for it.
[03:26.240 --> 03:26.360]  No.
[03:27.860 --> 03:30.800]  I couldn't get through it without laughing, so he found me out.
[03:30.820 --> 03:31.840]  That is a giveaway.
[03:32.720 --> 03:34.320]  So is Errol still around?
[03:34.820 --> 03:37.960]  Is there a cheekier version of you now that can speak him out?
[03:38.100 --> 03:39.520]  Or should I be like, oh, that's Errol speaking?
[03:39.800 --> 03:41.380]  Or when did Errol die?
[03:42.140 --> 03:44.300]  I think Errol died the same year he was born.
[03:45.260 --> 03:45.680]  Really?
[03:46.120 --> 03:46.840]  I feel like now.
[03:47.260 --> 03:50.160]  Maybe if I'm a little bit tipsy now.
[03:50.160 --> 03:51.600]  Maybe Errol will come back.
[03:52.220 --> 03:55.560]  Can we get a grave for Errol somewhere?
[03:55.760 --> 03:58.560]  Can we have an official placement for Errol?
[03:58.580 --> 04:01.560]  Yeah, like a 2002 to 2002 Errol?
[04:01.620 --> 04:02.520]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:02.780 --> 04:02.880]  Errol Free.
[04:02.880 --> 04:04.420]  But like, in a cemetery.
[04:05.040 --> 04:08.260]  Can we just buy a space and put an Errol grave down?
[04:09.320 --> 04:10.380]  I bet we could.
[04:10.660 --> 04:11.280]  I bet we could.
[04:11.840 --> 04:15.300]  And then f***ing Facelessness can go and pay their respects to Errol.
[04:15.440 --> 04:15.860]  Yeah.
[04:15.860 --> 04:22.480]  I think we probably want an isolated part of the cemetery for that.
[04:22.960 --> 04:24.840]  F***ing Jim Morrison's grave.
[04:25.040 --> 04:26.200]  You can go leave s*** there.
[04:26.520 --> 04:33.560]  How much would it cost to bring in a load of dirt to the show floor of RTX and put Tombstone in it?
[04:33.620 --> 04:34.260]  Oh, man.
[04:35.260 --> 04:36.960]  That's great for the museum.
[04:37.800 --> 04:38.680]  That's perfect.
[04:40.220 --> 04:40.520]  Errol.
[04:40.800 --> 04:42.480]  Was it Errol Free?
[04:42.800 --> 04:44.260]  Or was it a different last name?
[04:44.260 --> 04:45.300]  It's just Errol.
[04:45.800 --> 04:47.740]  Just Errol like in quotes. Errol.
[04:48.260 --> 04:54.880]  Now, you've been talking a lot about Errol was cheeky. Can you give us some cheeky Errol examples of when Errol would come out?
[04:55.340 --> 04:56.300]  Yeah, what's an Errolism?
[04:56.960 --> 04:58.600]  I think if I was just...
[04:58.600 --> 04:59.780]  I can't really remember.
[04:59.960 --> 05:02.640]  I'd probably have to talk to some of my old friends to be like,
[05:02.960 --> 05:04.200]  Remember when Errol would come out?
[05:07.540 --> 05:09.260]  Did Errol have walkout music?
[05:11.000 --> 05:12.220]  Or did he have a whole alter ego?
[05:12.220 --> 05:14.200]  Did you think...
[05:14.200 --> 05:17.240]  Now, would Errol just come out? Would you just say something and that was Errol?
[05:17.340 --> 05:18.800]  Or would you think about it and decide,
[05:18.900 --> 05:20.680]  You know what? Errol's going to make an appearance here.
[05:20.720 --> 05:22.500]  I'm going to say that slightly more cheeky thing.
[05:23.560 --> 05:25.880]  I think I would always talk about him in the past tense.
[05:25.980 --> 05:27.040]  Like Errol had happened.
[05:27.880 --> 05:29.000]  Oh, so it's like a cover.
[05:29.220 --> 05:30.400]  Like you'd be cheeky and you'd be like,
[05:30.460 --> 05:32.200]  Ah, sorry guys. Errol showed up for a minute there.
[05:32.280 --> 05:35.240]  But we all had these characters and we'd always talk about our characters.
[05:35.580 --> 05:36.440]  Wait, wait, wait.
[05:36.440 --> 05:37.480]  You all had characters?
[05:37.500 --> 05:38.640]  Well, yeah. Like Frank had Herman.
[05:41.320 --> 05:43.560]  But we would like often talk about what they were like.
[05:46.460 --> 05:49.960]  Look, I had a very long walk to school.
[05:50.220 --> 05:53.220]  I had about a 35 minute trek across town.
[05:53.480 --> 05:54.500]  It was boring.
[05:54.760 --> 05:55.820]  You had to do these things.
[05:56.120 --> 05:57.640]  I respect. I just love what...
[05:57.640 --> 05:59.760]  I couldn't have lived further from the school
[05:59.760 --> 06:01.780]  without being like in a bus district.
[06:02.160 --> 06:03.360]  I thought this was a youth thing.
[06:03.420 --> 06:05.180]  The fact that you had a community of friends
[06:05.180 --> 06:06.300]  all doing the same thing.
[06:06.360 --> 06:07.880]  I'm so glad you all found each other.
[06:08.020 --> 06:08.620]  That's such a wonderful thing.
[06:08.620 --> 06:09.480]  You have four of us.
[06:10.700 --> 06:12.100]  I think it's delight.
[06:12.720 --> 06:13.580]  Positively delightful.
[06:13.960 --> 06:16.580]  I also had another character
[06:16.580 --> 06:18.240]  that I would only bring out
[06:18.240 --> 06:19.880]  amongst a certain few people.
[06:19.980 --> 06:21.160]  This is probably when I was...
[06:22.760 --> 06:24.140]  When I was 20.
[06:24.800 --> 06:25.020]  You have two?
[06:25.560 --> 06:26.840]  Yeah, in the south of France.
[06:27.540 --> 06:30.040]  I used to go there a lot with the same group of friends.
[06:30.440 --> 06:32.080]  And I would always whip out a character called
[06:33.040 --> 06:34.520]  Stuart the Bumbling Customer.
[06:34.900 --> 06:35.960]  And I would like look at stuff
[06:35.960 --> 06:38.180]  I would look at stuff on the shelves
[06:38.180 --> 06:40.160]  I'd like pick up a shampoo and then accidentally
[06:40.160 --> 06:42.000]  knock down like seven shampoos
[06:42.000 --> 06:43.900]  and it would just crack up these three friends
[06:43.900 --> 06:45.820]  and I'd have to go back and put it all back up
[06:45.820 --> 06:47.960]  because I worked in a supermarket
[06:47.960 --> 06:50.040]  and I couldn't live myself to leave it like that.
[06:50.720 --> 06:52.020]  But I would just knock shit over
[06:52.020 --> 06:53.360]  in a supermarket and then be like
[06:54.160 --> 06:54.920]  Stuart's back.
[06:58.640 --> 06:59.920]  Honestly, I shouldn't...
[06:59.920 --> 07:01.600]  Talking about all this in a row
[07:01.600 --> 07:04.200]  for like six minutes, I'm starting to feel
[07:04.200 --> 07:05.000]  like a real freak.
[07:05.120 --> 07:08.560]  I feel like Stuart is more normal.
[07:08.720 --> 07:10.340]  Stuart feels like you're doing a sketch
[07:10.340 --> 07:12.400]  almost, like that's a character where Errol feels
[07:12.400 --> 07:14.140]  like a strange, you're just slightly
[07:14.140 --> 07:15.060]  more sassy.
[07:15.400 --> 07:17.800]  I've pulled out Stuart around Meg before.
[07:18.000 --> 07:19.640]  She hates it. She's not a fan.
[07:20.100 --> 07:22.180]  Stuart also has died
[07:22.180 --> 07:22.580]  unfortunately.
[07:23.200 --> 07:24.960]  I can't believe I've known you
[07:25.880 --> 07:28.100]  five years before Stuart was born
[07:28.100 --> 07:29.440]  and I've never seen Stuart.
[07:29.760 --> 07:31.040]  The thing is, I forget stuff.
[07:31.040 --> 07:33.180]  I probably forgot it for a decade
[07:33.180 --> 07:35.220]  and then I whipped it out again. But yeah, in the middle
[07:35.220 --> 07:37.000]  I lived with you and I think Stuart and Errol
[07:37.000 --> 07:38.380]  were both dead at the same time.
[07:38.860 --> 07:41.080]  You have different
[07:41.080 --> 07:42.400]  shit for different friends, right?
[07:43.000 --> 07:43.340]  That's true.
[07:45.700 --> 07:46.880]  You compartmentalize that stuff
[07:46.880 --> 07:47.900]  and you don't realize it.
[07:48.480 --> 07:51.000]  I should've whipped out Stuart when we were shopping
[07:51.000 --> 07:52.240]  for the tiniest thing the other day.
[07:54.360 --> 07:54.780]  Eric,
[07:54.960 --> 07:56.920]  can you imagine if Gavin
[07:56.920 --> 07:58.900]  slipped into a character named Stuart
[07:58.900 --> 08:00.600]  that we had never seen
[08:00.600 --> 08:01.980]  or been exposed to before?
[08:02.520 --> 08:04.080]  I would've lost my mind.
[08:04.160 --> 08:07.040]  We just keep asking him questions about the rules
[08:07.040 --> 08:08.940]  and he knows that he has
[08:08.940 --> 08:10.380]  to answer them but he won't.
[08:10.480 --> 08:12.180]  I would hate Stuart.
[08:12.680 --> 08:14.320]  That's terrible. I hate it.
[08:14.800 --> 08:15.240]  Oh boy.
[08:16.940 --> 08:18.320]  What a start.
[08:18.480 --> 08:20.320]  Can I ask where do the names come from?
[08:20.500 --> 08:22.740]  Was Errol a name that you were just fascinated with?
[08:23.420 --> 08:24.900]  I think it's a really
[08:25.780 --> 08:26.280]  funny name.
[08:26.280 --> 08:27.640]  I think it's great.
[08:27.680 --> 08:28.020]  Errol?
[08:29.680 --> 08:30.800]  It's fun to yell.
[08:31.120 --> 08:32.760]  Like if you're annoyed with somebody.
[08:34.100 --> 08:35.640]  I haven't heard it yelled.
[08:36.120 --> 08:37.920]  Were you aware of the famous
[08:37.920 --> 08:39.340]  British actor Errol Flynn?
[08:39.720 --> 08:41.820]  He was like Robin Hood and all that stuff.
[08:42.260 --> 08:44.120]  No, I didn't know anyone called Errol.
[08:44.180 --> 08:45.620]  It wasn't modeled after him in any way.
[08:45.940 --> 08:48.140]  That's great. Thank you for sharing that.
[08:48.440 --> 08:50.320]  I think Errol Flynn was Australian,
[08:50.480 --> 08:51.660]  wasn't he? He might've been.
[08:51.780 --> 08:52.560]  It's all the same.
[08:52.560 --> 08:53.660]  What would your...
[08:53.660 --> 08:55.800]  Did you guys go into any
[08:56.720 --> 08:58.000]  characters when you were younger?
[08:58.380 --> 08:59.540]  Not that had names.
[09:00.220 --> 09:02.360]  Oh, what was yours?
[09:02.880 --> 09:03.240]  I...
[09:04.500 --> 09:05.500]  I used to...
[09:06.480 --> 09:07.320]  Oh no.
[09:08.400 --> 09:09.600]  I used to...
[09:14.080 --> 09:15.780]  What is this gonna be?
[09:16.100 --> 09:17.060]  I'm so worried.
[09:18.740 --> 09:20.020]  Talk about not thinking about
[09:20.020 --> 09:21.000]  stuff for years and years.
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.020]  Up until I was way
[09:23.020 --> 09:25.020]  too old, whenever I was by
[09:25.020 --> 09:27.000]  myself, I would pretend I was Wolverine.
[09:28.820 --> 09:31.160]  In what way? To call myself Logan.
[09:31.780 --> 09:32.620]  Walk around.
[09:33.120 --> 09:35.280]  Always be ready to pop the claws.
[09:35.800 --> 09:37.000]  Always looking around for
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.780]  ninjas to be attacking me.
[09:39.740 --> 09:40.960]  And by too
[09:40.960 --> 09:43.000]  little... I was probably... I might've been
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.880]  14 when I stopped. Oh man.
[09:45.260 --> 09:46.240]  Assuming this is later.
[09:46.660 --> 09:47.740]  What would you do?
[09:47.740 --> 09:49.040]  Would you talk to yourself?
[09:49.920 --> 09:52.020]  Yeah, I'd be like... I'd walk around
[09:52.020 --> 09:53.720]  in my neighborhood and be like, I'm the best
[09:53.720 --> 09:54.520]  at what I do.
[09:55.720 --> 09:57.660]  Very pretty. And I would do all this shit.
[09:57.700 --> 09:59.720]  I would say all that stuff. And I'd be like, on my
[09:59.720 --> 10:01.680]  way to... If I was gonna go to my friend Mike's house,
[10:01.760 --> 10:03.780]  I'd be like, on my way to rendezvous with Cyclops.
[10:04.500 --> 10:05.120]  Or whatever.
[10:05.420 --> 10:07.620]  I would just have all these X-Men fantasies in my head.
[10:07.700 --> 10:08.980]  And I was always Wolverine.
[10:09.200 --> 10:11.680]  I had some excuse for why I was taller
[10:11.680 --> 10:13.700]  than Wolverine. Something had happened to me.
[10:13.800 --> 10:14.600]  Oh, that's great.
[10:14.600 --> 10:15.080]  It was great.
[10:15.820 --> 10:18.100]  Did Mike know he was Cyclops?
[10:18.580 --> 10:20.480]  No, nobody had any idea.
[10:20.520 --> 10:21.960]  I never shared this. When it would rain,
[10:22.960 --> 10:24.680]  all the best Wolverine comics
[10:24.680 --> 10:26.380]  were him bending down,
[10:26.480 --> 10:27.780]  popping his claws in the rain.
[10:28.020 --> 10:30.080]  He's got a menacing face on.
[10:30.520 --> 10:32.760]  So anytime it would rain in Alabama,
[10:33.020 --> 10:34.880]  I would run outside and run around as Wolverine
[10:34.880 --> 10:35.340]  in the rain.
[10:36.200 --> 10:38.120]  So I assume this was before the
[10:38.700 --> 10:40.380]  amazing Saturday morning cartoon
[10:40.380 --> 10:41.400]  with the amazing theme tune.
[10:42.300 --> 10:43.420]  It would have probably been
[10:43.420 --> 10:45.440]  around then. Probably a little bit
[10:45.440 --> 10:47.160]  before. Maybe a year or two before. I think that was like
[10:47.160 --> 10:49.400]  when did that come out? Like 91? 97?
[10:49.580 --> 10:50.040]  Something like that.
[10:50.340 --> 10:53.320]  You said
[10:53.320 --> 10:55.460]  walking around ready to pop the claws
[10:55.460 --> 10:57.480]  and when that situation presented itself,
[10:57.560 --> 10:58.360]  Geoff, what would happen?
[10:59.100 --> 11:01.440]  I'd pop the claws. I imagine him walking around
[11:01.440 --> 11:03.320]  with like three carrots between
[11:03.320 --> 11:05.360]  his fingers. I'd pop the claws
[11:05.920 --> 11:07.360]  and then I would fucking take out
[11:07.360 --> 11:08.240]  invisible dudes.
[11:08.700 --> 11:10.380]  Yeah. I feel like that's like
[11:10.380 --> 11:12.240]  a wrist snap in my head you do for like
[11:12.240 --> 11:13.960]  the action or like what the pop is.
[11:14.300 --> 11:16.200]  Almost like shooting. Yeah. That's
[11:16.200 --> 11:17.980]  so great. I love that you did that.
[11:18.420 --> 11:20.200]  I don't have that. I wish I had. Do you
[11:20.200 --> 11:22.260]  remember when Wolverine died? Do you have a moment
[11:22.260 --> 11:23.400]  for that when you just stopped?
[11:24.940 --> 11:26.420]  Yeah. It wasn't
[11:26.420 --> 11:27.820]  Wolverine that... Wolverine,
[11:28.240 --> 11:29.840]  he caught a stray bullet.
[11:30.460 --> 11:31.180]  Oh no!
[11:31.960 --> 11:34.040]  He caught a stray from another thing.
[11:34.500 --> 11:36.260]  I was... I think I may
[11:36.260 --> 11:38.480]  have told this story on this podcast
[11:38.480 --> 11:40.160]  or maybe on a different one
[11:40.160 --> 11:42.300]  so I'll be brief but like I was
[11:42.300 --> 11:44.060]  in my front yard one day
[11:44.580 --> 11:46.240]  playing G.I. Joe versus
[11:47.120 --> 11:48.540]  Transformers as you do
[11:49.540 --> 11:49.980]  and
[11:50.580 --> 11:52.100]  like I had built this base
[11:52.100 --> 11:54.400]  out of this dirt pile and
[11:54.400 --> 11:56.420]  G.I. Joe was going in to infiltrate
[11:56.420 --> 11:58.260]  the... Transformers were the bad guys this day.
[11:58.520 --> 12:00.220]  It flipped. Sometimes the Transformers were
[12:00.220 --> 12:02.120]  the good guys. Sometimes it was G.I. Joe. It just depended
[12:02.120 --> 12:03.740]  on whatever the storyline was.
[12:03.740 --> 12:05.920]  And they were infiltrating
[12:05.920 --> 12:08.000]  and they were gonna try to blow this base up
[12:08.000 --> 12:09.740]  and I just wasn't having fun
[12:09.740 --> 12:11.940]  and I'm like... I'm 14 or 15
[12:11.940 --> 12:13.860]  I think at this point and
[12:13.860 --> 12:15.860]  I just wasn't having fun and I
[12:15.860 --> 12:17.720]  went inside and what you do
[12:17.720 --> 12:19.740]  when playing with G.I. Joe gets boring
[12:19.740 --> 12:21.860]  is you go find your firecrackers
[12:21.860 --> 12:23.320]  and then you start blowing... then you start
[12:23.980 --> 12:25.820]  laying depth charges and
[12:25.820 --> 12:27.820]  fucking C4 and stuff and blowing stuff up
[12:27.820 --> 12:29.780]  and I was blowing up
[12:29.780 --> 12:31.920]  my G.I. Joe characters and it still wasn't
[12:31.920 --> 12:34.040]  fun and I just
[12:34.040 --> 12:35.500]  remember looking at them and thinking
[12:36.240 --> 12:37.900]  this is never gonna be fun again
[12:37.900 --> 12:39.940]  this is over. I just
[12:39.940 --> 12:42.020]  threw up. Like I was like this is
[12:42.020 --> 12:43.960]  the moment when I realized I'm not a kid
[12:43.960 --> 12:45.320]  anymore and I'll never
[12:46.120 --> 12:47.940]  I'll never enjoy this
[12:47.940 --> 12:49.920]  again and it made me so unbearably
[12:49.920 --> 12:52.040]  sad that there was a kid who lived
[12:52.040 --> 12:53.760]  next door to me. I lived in a duplex at the time
[12:54.280 --> 12:55.920]  It was a kid who lived next door to me who was
[12:55.920 --> 12:58.060]  about 11 or 12. I couldn't fucking stand
[12:58.060 --> 12:59.780]  him. He was obnoxious. But
[12:59.780 --> 13:01.840]  I just took all
[13:01.840 --> 13:03.920]  my G.I. Joe's that day and I put everything in a trash
[13:03.920 --> 13:05.420]  bag and I just walked over
[13:05.420 --> 13:07.800]  and I gave it all to him. And I was just like you can have
[13:07.800 --> 13:09.800]  this. I don't think I'll ever use it
[13:09.800 --> 13:11.420]  again. And I think Wolverine
[13:11.420 --> 13:13.920]  I don't specifically remember the day that Wolverine's healing
[13:13.920 --> 13:15.720]  powers finally failed and he
[13:15.720 --> 13:17.500]  succumbed to old age or death or whatever
[13:19.000 --> 13:19.400]  but
[13:20.580 --> 13:21.860]  he definitely died
[13:21.860 --> 13:23.580]  that day I think in my
[13:24.040 --> 13:25.520]  heart. That was
[13:25.520 --> 13:26.860]  like the day I remember
[13:26.860 --> 13:28.900]  the day I remember I wasn't a child anymore
[13:28.900 --> 13:30.780]  and I was something else. And what was even
[13:30.780 --> 13:31.440]  sadder
[13:31.440 --> 13:34.840]  what was even sadder in that
[13:34.840 --> 13:36.900]  moment was I realized I no longer had
[13:36.900 --> 13:38.940]  joy in the things that I had been enjoying my entire
[13:38.940 --> 13:40.860]  childhood. But I didn't know what I did
[13:40.860 --> 13:42.860]  like. I know I don't
[13:42.860 --> 13:44.840]  like all the stuff I used to like now. What
[13:44.840 --> 13:46.080]  do I like going forward?
[13:46.660 --> 13:48.620]  It took me a little while to figure that out.
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.800]  I would have loved if you had a one
[13:50.800 --> 13:52.100]  last claw pop moment.
[13:53.100 --> 13:54.760]  If you just had the you're aware you're like
[13:54.760 --> 13:56.900]  this is it. This is the last one. I mean maybe
[13:56.900 --> 13:58.560]  maybe maybe like
[13:58.560 --> 14:00.840]  who knows maybe once or twice you
[14:00.840 --> 14:02.840]  know in the woods when I'm 15 or 17
[14:02.840 --> 14:04.920]  or whatever. You'd have a moment where you'd slip
[14:04.920 --> 14:06.960]  into it and you'd be like oh what am I doing I'm fucking 17
[14:06.960 --> 14:08.460]  or whatever but yeah. That's great.
[14:08.840 --> 14:10.860]  Imagine if just all your friends were gone for some reason
[14:10.860 --> 14:12.780]  you're just waiting for a bus on your own and you just popped
[14:12.780 --> 14:14.820]  them. Yeah. Yeah probably. See if
[14:14.820 --> 14:16.560]  I still could. You know. See if they still work.
[14:16.740 --> 14:18.720]  You're like I don't resort to violence
[14:18.720 --> 14:20.680]  anymore but it's good to know I can if I have to.
[14:21.160 --> 14:22.900]  Wow who would have thought Andrew was the normal one?
[14:22.900 --> 14:24.940]  Well no I mean I didn't have a name
[14:24.940 --> 14:26.880]  I had a similar very similar experience to Geoff
[14:26.880 --> 14:28.920]  where I'd play like with plastic swords
[14:28.920 --> 14:30.740]  in like the backyard and pretend I was having
[14:30.740 --> 14:32.840]  fights and whatnot and
[14:32.840 --> 14:34.860]  I distinctly remember being like 10 years
[14:34.860 --> 14:36.920]  old and doing it and having the thing
[14:36.920 --> 14:38.520]  of like I can't buy into this anymore
[14:38.520 --> 14:40.960]  and I just never did it again. Just like
[14:40.960 --> 14:42.800]  the sadness of like oh man all the joy
[14:42.800 --> 14:44.620]  like you said. I did this is
[14:44.620 --> 14:46.960]  this isn't fun anymore. I can't buy
[14:46.960 --> 14:48.860]  into this. This is sad. This is an end of
[14:48.860 --> 14:50.540]  a chapter. Yeah it
[14:50.540 --> 14:53.040]  it is uh it was a legitimately
[14:53.040 --> 14:54.240]  and I assume it's the same for you Andrew
[14:54.240 --> 14:56.760]  it was a legitimately heartbreaking moment
[14:56.760 --> 14:57.780]  for me. Very heartbreaking.
[14:58.440 --> 15:00.580]  Which is why I'm 47 and I can still recall
[15:00.580 --> 15:02.020]  it like it was yesterday. Yes. You know
[15:02.540 --> 15:04.620]  those become foundational memories yeah.
[15:04.860 --> 15:06.160]  Absolutely and I wish I
[15:06.160 --> 15:08.540]  wish I still had that. Like it's a thing
[15:08.540 --> 15:10.160]  I lost that I wish I still maintained.
[15:10.840 --> 15:12.520]  I'd love to be able to have that much fun
[15:12.520 --> 15:14.360]  just swinging a plastic sword around.
[15:14.700 --> 15:15.240]  Yeah well you know
[15:16.800 --> 15:18.480]  you could have done that
[15:18.480 --> 15:20.740]  whenever you wanted to in Achievement Hunter it was tons of fun.
[15:21.960 --> 15:24.380]  A lot of sword play back then.
[15:25.020 --> 15:26.500]  Eric and Nick were either of you
[15:26.500 --> 15:26.980]  freaks?
[15:29.440 --> 15:29.920]  No
[15:30.480 --> 15:32.500]  I can't think of anything that I did
[15:32.500 --> 15:34.500]  like that like when I was like a
[15:34.500 --> 15:36.440]  kid we pretended to be the X-Men
[15:36.440 --> 15:38.340]  but it wasn't like I was
[15:38.340 --> 15:40.360]  walking around waiting to pop the
[15:40.360 --> 15:42.280]  claws. It was just you know
[15:42.280 --> 15:44.320]  playing with friends being like
[15:44.320 --> 15:45.720]  we're the X-Men and like
[15:45.720 --> 15:47.680]  yeah fighting fake things like
[15:47.680 --> 15:49.640]  that that was kind of it. I would use
[15:49.640 --> 15:51.500]  a pseudonym a lot. I would use the name
[15:51.500 --> 15:52.980]  Terry Modesto Jr.
[15:53.400 --> 15:55.780]  when I had to fill out paperwork that I didn't want
[15:56.340 --> 15:57.540]  anything to do with
[15:57.540 --> 15:59.420]  that was just my go-to
[15:59.420 --> 16:01.360]  but it didn't like I didn't have
[16:01.360 --> 16:03.960]  I wasn't a bit cheeky when it happened.
[16:04.280 --> 16:06.140]  I just continued being me.
[16:06.800 --> 16:07.800]  Where did Terry
[16:07.800 --> 16:09.880]  Modesto Jr. come from? That's such a specific
[16:09.880 --> 16:11.680]  name. I don't know it just it seemed
[16:11.680 --> 16:13.700]  like a like a real fake
[16:13.700 --> 16:15.660]  name to me. Like it seems like a fake name
[16:15.660 --> 16:17.860]  but it just has like one layer
[16:17.860 --> 16:19.580]  where you go could be a real name and that
[16:19.580 --> 16:21.000]  to me is where it really worked.
[16:21.900 --> 16:23.460]  I feel like all of our fake names
[16:23.900 --> 16:26.080]  give a good indication of where we all grew up.
[16:30.040 --> 16:31.780]  I gotta say Gav, I think
[16:31.780 --> 16:33.720]  you deserve the most credit. I
[16:33.720 --> 16:35.600]  was playing some shit I read in a comic book.
[16:35.660 --> 16:37.980]  You invented characters out of sackcloth and ashes.
[16:38.120 --> 16:38.900]  Just like out of Iron Man.
[16:39.200 --> 16:40.800]  I think that's probably a lot harder.
[16:40.800 --> 16:42.780]  I have a lot of respect for that.
[16:42.860 --> 16:44.680]  Same as Terry Modesto Jr.
[16:44.760 --> 16:45.060]  of course.
[16:46.960 --> 16:49.040]  You guys weren't just like latching on to some
[16:49.040 --> 16:50.560]  IP that was already popular.
[16:50.700 --> 16:52.820]  You were creating your own. I feel like the next episode
[16:52.820 --> 16:54.420]  is going to have a great intro. That's what I'm saying.
[16:54.920 --> 16:56.760]  Nick? Yeah, what is Nick
[16:56.760 --> 16:58.820]  talking about in the chat? I had a
[16:58.820 --> 17:00.720]  weird combined one as a kid.
[17:01.000 --> 17:02.360]  What? It was a grouping.
[17:02.620 --> 17:04.820]  So it was like my friends and I were fans
[17:04.820 --> 17:06.740]  of the Power Rangers as kids but we
[17:06.740 --> 17:08.340]  also liked professional wrestling.
[17:08.340 --> 17:10.400]  So we would kind of combine
[17:10.400 --> 17:12.240]  them. You'd be like, oh, the
[17:12.240 --> 17:14.400]  Red Rangers going off the top ropes kind of thing.
[17:14.440 --> 17:16.220]  You know, like doing goofy shit like that.
[17:16.460 --> 17:18.280]  So it would all be like, Jason,
[17:18.420 --> 17:19.880]  Tommy! You know, like
[17:20.360 --> 17:22.280]  goofy stuff like that. But the day
[17:22.280 --> 17:24.240]  that it ended, I remember very well when
[17:24.240 --> 17:26.100]  Tommy and Jason were put to rest.
[17:26.120 --> 17:28.240]  It was when we were wrestling on a
[17:28.240 --> 17:30.280]  giant trampoline and I dropkicked
[17:30.280 --> 17:31.420]  my friend off the ledge.
[17:32.520 --> 17:34.380]  He was fine.
[17:34.560 --> 17:36.400]  But on that day, the magic died
[17:36.400 --> 17:36.960]  and he lived again.
[17:37.860 --> 17:40.360]  That was the last day
[17:40.360 --> 17:42.320]  of the Wrestle Rangers. Yeah, the Wrestle
[17:42.320 --> 17:43.580]  Rangers ceased to be.
[17:44.560 --> 17:46.520]  Whenever Nick does the voice of himself
[17:46.520 --> 17:48.340]  as a kid, I can't help but picture
[17:48.340 --> 17:50.120]  the little propeller on his head as he's doing it.
[17:55.020 --> 17:55.980]  God damn.
[17:56.660 --> 17:57.880]  Man, what a funny
[17:58.720 --> 18:00.240]  conversation we stumbled into.
[18:01.540 --> 18:02.400]  That's 20 minutes
[18:02.400 --> 18:04.420]  of shit that definitely wasn't written down anyway.
[18:06.720 --> 18:08.040]  Yeah, I didn't have any of that in mind.
[18:09.960 --> 18:10.520]  It's going to
[18:10.520 --> 18:12.220]  be a while before I escape the idea of
[18:12.220 --> 18:14.320]  Ivan Ooze getting hit by a
[18:14.320 --> 18:16.260]  steel chair with Nick as a kid.
[18:17.480 --> 18:18.180]  Purple shit
[18:18.180 --> 18:20.300]  flying everywhere. That's great, Nick. I love that.
[18:21.760 --> 18:22.480]  Oh, man.
[18:23.560 --> 18:24.480]  I can't believe
[18:24.480 --> 18:26.560]  we're almost 20 minutes into this
[18:26.560 --> 18:28.420]  and this is not... you are,
[18:28.620 --> 18:30.320]  as far as I'm concerned, Geoff, the
[18:30.320 --> 18:32.000]  star of this episode.
[18:32.160 --> 18:34.360]  I want to know so much about how your weekend
[18:34.360 --> 18:36.200]  went. We built up the big sports weekend
[18:36.200 --> 18:38.380]  last episode. I haven't asked any
[18:38.380 --> 18:40.240]  questions in our personal life because
[18:40.240 --> 18:42.480]  I'm just so excited to hear it here. I've just seen one
[18:42.480 --> 18:44.360]  clip. Yeah, we've seen
[18:44.360 --> 18:46.560]  the same thing. Yeah, let me...
[18:46.560 --> 18:48.500]  let's get into that. We'll mix
[18:48.500 --> 18:50.580]  it up with that. Although I don't know how many great stories
[18:50.580 --> 18:51.860]  there are to tell or anything, but I'll
[18:52.240 --> 18:54.360]  recount the weekend. Yeah, I'd love to hear that.
[18:54.380 --> 18:55.920]  Eric can as well. He was a part of most of it.
[18:56.540 --> 18:57.940]  But I do have...
[18:57.940 --> 19:00.320]  I have some hot
[19:01.800 --> 19:02.400]  info that
[19:02.400 --> 19:04.580]  I need to drop that you guys are not aware
[19:04.580 --> 19:06.540]  of. Eric knows about it, but the rest of you don't.
[19:07.100 --> 19:08.100]  There has been a
[19:08.100 --> 19:10.800]  major, major,
[19:12.260 --> 19:12.780]  MAJOR
[19:13.440 --> 19:14.480]  face update
[19:14.480 --> 19:15.800]  in the last week.
[19:16.980 --> 19:18.420]  An insane thing
[19:18.420 --> 19:19.780]  has happened. I'm terrified.
[19:20.520 --> 19:22.360]  About five days ago, Emily
[19:22.360 --> 19:24.380]  walked into Millie's bedroom
[19:24.380 --> 19:26.420]  to ask her
[19:26.420 --> 19:27.260]  a question or something.
[19:28.220 --> 19:30.140]  And Millie was just sitting at her bed,
[19:30.140 --> 19:31.400]  chomping on an apple.
[19:31.980 --> 19:32.560]  And Emily said,
[19:33.160 --> 19:35.760]  Hey, where'd you get that apple? We don't have any apples.
[19:36.260 --> 19:37.220]  And Millie said,
[19:37.680 --> 19:40.100]  Yeah, we do. Millie ate my Cosmic
[19:40.100 --> 19:40.500]  Crisps.
[19:42.280 --> 19:43.740]  She had no idea.
[19:44.020 --> 19:46.140]  To her credit, it was just sitting in the
[19:46.140 --> 19:47.960]  fridge by itself in the back. I had
[19:47.960 --> 19:50.260]  hidden it behind stuff, but she found it.
[19:51.220 --> 19:52.140]  I don't remember
[19:52.140 --> 19:54.100]  the day we put it in, but it's gotta be at least
[19:54.100 --> 19:55.300]  three or four months old.
[19:56.800 --> 19:58.140]  She ate the
[19:58.140 --> 19:59.840]  entire thing, even after I told her
[20:00.620 --> 20:02.300]  stop, it's not good.
[20:02.940 --> 20:04.260]  She insisted that it was.
[20:04.360 --> 20:06.300]  She said it was the best tasting apple
[20:06.300 --> 20:08.280]  she has ever eaten in her life.
[20:08.460 --> 20:10.180]  And she said it was defined by
[20:10.180 --> 20:12.280]  the fact that one half
[20:12.280 --> 20:14.200]  was very sweet, and the
[20:14.200 --> 20:15.620]  other half was very sour.
[20:15.800 --> 20:18.340]  So she felt like she got two apples in one.
[20:19.160 --> 20:20.060]  Was it like which
[20:20.060 --> 20:21.660]  side was facing the back of the fridge?
[20:21.860 --> 20:24.060]  I assume so. I assume it had
[20:24.060 --> 20:25.740]  to be something like that.
[20:25.740 --> 20:27.860]  But yeah, so our...
[20:27.860 --> 20:28.780]  Oh my god.
[20:29.240 --> 20:30.160]  We gotta reset the clock.
[20:31.240 --> 20:32.840]  I gotta go out and buy a new apple.
[20:34.260 --> 20:35.540]  Cause yeah, cause
[20:35.540 --> 20:36.980]  Millie ate our progress.
[20:37.840 --> 20:39.660]  Can I be honest with you about
[20:39.660 --> 20:40.780]  the apple thing? Yeah.
[20:42.220 --> 20:43.800]  I don't think I did that,
[20:43.920 --> 20:45.700]  right? I just never did. No, you never did.
[20:46.440 --> 20:47.660]  There's a Cosmic Crisp
[20:47.660 --> 20:48.380]  in my fridge.
[20:49.560 --> 20:49.960]  What?
[20:51.500 --> 20:53.780]  I found it the other day, like behind a bunch
[20:53.780 --> 20:55.720]  of stuff. When did I
[20:56.400 --> 20:57.280]  put that in?
[20:58.160 --> 20:59.800]  You never told us that you
[20:59.800 --> 21:01.700]  did that. I don't remember doing it
[21:01.700 --> 21:02.120]  myself.
[21:03.600 --> 21:05.740]  We made fun of the fact that you never
[21:05.740 --> 21:07.920]  tried. I ate my apple after a few
[21:07.920 --> 21:09.780]  weeks. You never
[21:09.780 --> 21:11.840]  did it. When would that have
[21:11.840 --> 21:13.740]  been? And I asked Meg
[21:13.740 --> 21:15.820]  about it. I was like, is this yours? And she's like
[21:15.820 --> 21:17.580]  no, that's your Cosmic Crisp.
[21:18.220 --> 21:19.760]  What? How old?
[21:20.000 --> 21:21.720]  When? Wow. I have no
[21:21.720 --> 21:23.680]  idea. Can you tell at all? Does it
[21:23.680 --> 21:25.940]  look old? Yeah, it doesn't
[21:25.940 --> 21:27.780]  look great. Oh, that's
[21:27.780 --> 21:29.700]  probably a year. Do you think
[21:29.700 --> 21:31.160]  it wasn't you? Could it have been Errol?
[21:31.720 --> 21:33.680]  Could have been sheeky old Errol coming out
[21:33.680 --> 21:35.200]  and putting a Cosmic Crisp in there.
[21:36.320 --> 21:37.800]  Can you cut it in half and see if
[21:37.800 --> 21:39.240]  there's a sweet side and a sour side?
[21:39.780 --> 21:40.740]  Oh my god.
[21:41.480 --> 21:43.540]  So now I don't know how old that is.
[21:43.600 --> 21:45.760]  I might have to... Would you be willing to try
[21:45.760 --> 21:47.740]  it or like cut it open and maybe take a bite?
[21:47.860 --> 21:49.680]  Can we get photos of this? Because I feel like this
[21:49.680 --> 21:51.440]  is over a year. It has to.
[21:51.440 --> 21:53.040]  Should I go and take a photo of it now? Yeah.
[21:53.160 --> 21:55.620]  If you want, we're doing two. We can do it on the second one.
[21:55.840 --> 21:57.260]  Let's do it next week.
[21:57.380 --> 21:59.500]  A little teaser for the next episode.
[22:00.160 --> 22:01.700]  I can't believe she ate that. That's
[22:01.700 --> 22:03.740]  great. That gives me confidence because I've
[22:03.740 --> 22:05.720]  had some Cosmic Crisps in my
[22:05.720 --> 22:07.740]  fridge for two weeks now
[22:07.740 --> 22:09.160]  maybe? Two or three?
[22:09.440 --> 22:11.620]  Oh, they're fine. Yeah. No, I kind of
[22:11.620 --> 22:13.860]  had the concern. I thought, nah, they're fine. They're gonna last a while.
[22:14.120 --> 22:15.760]  I've got so much more road to give
[22:15.760 --> 22:17.580]  before I need to worry about those things. It's great.
[22:18.180 --> 22:19.880]  I'll have to go back and check my photos.
[22:20.020 --> 22:21.460]  I think I took a photo the day I put it in
[22:21.460 --> 22:23.600]  to see the timestamp, but it must
[22:23.600 --> 22:25.360]  be three months. That's incredible.
[22:25.880 --> 22:27.360]  Yeah. Wow.
[22:27.940 --> 22:29.620]  What a great app. Kudos to the
[22:29.620 --> 22:31.100]  Cosmic Crisp. It didn't
[22:31.100 --> 22:33.520]  make it a year, but only because it
[22:33.520 --> 22:34.660]  looked so delicious, apparently.
[22:36.580 --> 22:37.460]  The hemispheres
[22:37.460 --> 22:39.640]  of flavor is very interesting. I wonder if that's a permanent
[22:39.640 --> 22:40.980]  thing. Yeah.
[22:41.240 --> 22:43.680]  Or a thing across all the Cosmic Crisps
[22:43.680 --> 22:45.220]  of a year. So,
[22:45.900 --> 22:46.300]  XFL.
[22:47.140 --> 22:48.520]  You went to it.
[22:49.020 --> 22:51.180]  You did the thing. First off, let me just say,
[22:51.280 --> 22:53.440]  it was a crazy sports weekend because
[22:53.440 --> 22:55.080]  the city of Austin hosted
[22:55.080 --> 22:57.240]  two NBA games, one on Thursday, one on
[22:57.240 --> 22:59.120]  Saturday, and then I did the San Antonio
[22:59.120 --> 23:01.040]  Brahma's game on Sunday.
[23:01.200 --> 23:03.220]  So it was a shitload of
[23:03.220 --> 23:05.060]  sports in a very short amount of time.
[23:05.520 --> 23:07.080]  Which is awesome for me because I love fucking
[23:07.080 --> 23:09.200]  sports, right? But what I don't like
[23:09.200 --> 23:11.280]  is leaving my house, so that part of it was hard.
[23:12.560 --> 23:13.580]  I took
[23:13.920 --> 23:15.320]  Eric to see the Spurs
[23:15.320 --> 23:17.140]  versus the Trailblazers on
[23:17.140 --> 23:18.200]  Thursday night.
[23:18.980 --> 23:21.200]  What did you think about that game, Eric?
[23:21.520 --> 23:23.280]  It was not good until
[23:23.280 --> 23:25.100]  the fourth quarter where it became
[23:25.100 --> 23:27.560]  such a fun basketball
[23:27.560 --> 23:29.380]  game that the crowd was
[23:29.380 --> 23:31.200]  so into, we left going,
[23:31.500 --> 23:32.660]  Austin needs to have a team.
[23:33.180 --> 23:35.460]  It ruled so hard
[23:35.460 --> 23:36.540]  and
[23:37.860 --> 23:39.220]  it had
[23:39.980 --> 23:40.540]  the
[23:42.120 --> 23:43.140]  halftime show
[23:43.140 --> 23:45.380]  that I always make a joke about
[23:45.380 --> 23:47.260]  because I've wanted to see it
[23:47.260 --> 23:49.320]  for years and it was real
[23:49.320 --> 23:50.540]  and it happened.
[23:51.020 --> 23:53.140]  It is a small dog who
[23:53.140 --> 23:54.700]  does basketball tricks
[23:55.220 --> 23:57.100]  and it is the
[23:57.100 --> 23:59.260]  best. Halftime shows are really
[23:59.260 --> 24:01.140]  hit and miss because when Geoff went to the
[24:01.140 --> 24:03.300]  other game, it was just a dance crew.
[24:03.800 --> 24:04.580]  I don't care about that. Big miss.
[24:04.920 --> 24:09.200]  The move crew. Blame...
[24:09.200 --> 24:11.380]  I want to see a tiny dog do a 360
[24:11.380 --> 24:12.700]  dunk again, god damn it.
[24:13.240 --> 24:15.320]  The San Antonio Spurs
[24:15.320 --> 24:17.560]  have a creature as their mascot
[24:17.560 --> 24:19.420]  and he challenged the small
[24:19.420 --> 24:21.340]  dog to a dunk contest and then
[24:21.340 --> 24:23.180]  the small dog won. It was so cool.
[24:23.780 --> 24:25.360]  He did a 360 dunk. It was so
[24:25.360 --> 24:26.780]  sick. It was awesome.

[27:36.600 --> 27:38.460]  without ExpressVPN is like leaving
[27:38.460 --> 27:40.340]  your kids with the nearest stranger while
[27:40.340 --> 27:42.280]  using the restroom. Everybody
[27:42.280 --> 27:44.460]  knows how irresponsible that is.
[27:44.520 --> 27:46.360]  You always leave the kid with the
[27:46.360 --> 27:48.400]  furthest stranger. It's obvious. It's
[27:48.400 --> 27:49.480]  very clear advice.
[27:50.160 --> 27:52.520]  And most of the time it's going to turn out to be
[27:52.520 --> 27:54.600]  fine. But you never truly know
[27:54.600 --> 27:56.560]  who you're trusting. Could be the Vancouver
[27:56.560 --> 27:58.580]  child kicker. Could be.
[27:59.080 --> 28:00.520]  I mean, I don't know who that is.
[28:00.580 --> 28:01.900]  Certainly not me, but it could be them.
[28:02.460 --> 28:04.500]  Why would you ever risk it? That's why
[28:04.500 --> 28:06.180]  you need to be using ExpressVPN.
[28:06.620 --> 28:08.580]  Every time you connect to an unencrypted
[28:08.580 --> 28:10.680]  network in cafes, hotels, airports,
[28:10.840 --> 28:12.520]  basically any network that's not
[28:12.520 --> 28:14.700]  your own, your online data is not
[28:14.700 --> 28:16.580]  secured. Any hacker on the same
[28:16.580 --> 28:18.540]  network can gain access to and steal
[28:18.540 --> 28:20.700]  your personal data. Passwords,
[28:20.860 --> 28:22.340]  financial details, you name it.

[29:06.280 --> 29:08.300]  I gotta echo
[29:08.300 --> 29:10.280]  Eric's sentiments. We went to the new
[29:10.280 --> 29:12.280]  it's a new arena that was just built
[29:12.280 --> 29:13.720]  in Austin called the Moody Center.
[29:14.200 --> 29:16.060]  And it's
[29:16.060 --> 29:18.140]  not built for NBA games, but it
[29:18.140 --> 29:19.260]  housed an NBA game
[29:20.040 --> 29:21.300]  beautifully. It would make
[29:21.300 --> 29:23.360]  it already would be one of the best
[29:23.360 --> 29:25.180]  arenas in the NBA. And the city
[29:25.180 --> 29:27.200]  of Austin deserves
[29:27.200 --> 29:29.100]  an NBA team, god damn it. And I'm gonna
[29:29.100 --> 29:31.060]  say that, it's gonna get really annoying
[29:31.060 --> 29:33.180]  because I'm gonna say that in every
[29:33.180 --> 29:35.200]  piece of content I record until
[29:35.200 --> 29:37.240]  Austin, Texas gets an NBA team
[29:37.240 --> 29:39.140]  which will be probably 15 years
[29:39.140 --> 29:41.220]  at the earliest. Anyway,
[29:41.400 --> 29:43.020]  so Saturday, I took a
[29:43.020 --> 29:45.620]  Millie to the next game, and it was fine.
[29:47.460 --> 29:47.980]  Minnesota
[29:47.980 --> 29:49.860]  Timberwolves won by like 50 or something.
[29:49.980 --> 29:51.740]  It was ridiculous. But
[29:51.740 --> 29:53.680]  Sunday, we went to
[29:53.680 --> 29:55.600]  go see the San Antonio
[29:55.600 --> 29:57.280]  Brahmas. It was me, Emily,
[29:58.400 --> 29:59.860]  Eric, and his small wife.
[30:00.000 --> 30:01.660]  We drove down to San Antonio together
[30:01.660 --> 30:03.380]  to the Alamo Dome,
[30:03.680 --> 30:05.700]  which if you're not familiar, it's
[30:05.700 --> 30:07.580]  a big arena in San Antonio
[30:07.580 --> 30:09.660]  where they have, it's like a cross between
[30:09.660 --> 30:11.080]  an arena and a convention center.
[30:11.920 --> 30:13.900]  Holds 75,000 people.
[30:13.900 --> 30:15.820]  It did come that day, but it holds
[30:15.820 --> 30:17.780]  up to 75,000 people.
[30:18.300 --> 30:19.860]  And it was the most, I don't even know
[30:19.860 --> 30:21.060]  how to describe it. It was fuckin'
[30:21.260 --> 30:23.880]  Before I do that, I must
[30:23.880 --> 30:25.980]  say, celebrity sighting at the NBA
[30:25.980 --> 30:27.900]  game on Saturday, we saw
[30:27.900 --> 30:29.960]  A-Rod. He's a part
[30:29.960 --> 30:31.760]  owner in the Minnesota Timberwolves, and he was there
[30:31.760 --> 30:33.820]  sitting courtside. So it was cool to see A-Rod
[30:33.820 --> 30:34.800]  at a game. That's awesome.
[30:35.300 --> 30:37.420]  He was next to Tony Parker,
[30:37.960 --> 30:39.900]  who was also in attendance, and
[30:39.900 --> 30:41.980]  Emily dubbed it Cheaters Row
[30:41.980 --> 30:43.480]  where they were sitting, which is pretty funny.
[30:45.140 --> 30:46.140]  If you don't know why, Tony Parker
[30:46.140 --> 30:47.960]  is famous for cheating on Eva Longoria
[30:47.960 --> 30:49.480]  with his teammate's wife,
[30:49.860 --> 30:51.660]  causing that teammate to have to get traded
[30:51.660 --> 30:53.780]  because Tony Parker was a much better player.
[30:53.980 --> 30:55.920]  And then, of course, A-Rod and drugs.
[30:56.520 --> 30:58.080]  It would suck to get traded because your friend
[30:58.080 --> 30:59.400]  cheated. Yeah, it would suck.
[30:59.980 --> 31:02.000]  It would suck. I may be getting that
[31:02.000 --> 31:04.060]  a little wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's how it shook out.
[31:04.840 --> 31:05.980]  Britt Berry's wife, there you go.
[31:06.540 --> 31:07.340]  Yeah, of course Nick knows.
[31:09.200 --> 31:09.600]  Anyway,
[31:10.740 --> 31:11.220]  the
[31:11.740 --> 31:12.940]  Brahma's game was awesome.
[31:14.080 --> 31:15.620]  They gave us tickets
[31:15.620 --> 31:17.540]  to this place called The Bullpen,
[31:17.940 --> 31:18.980]  which is essentially
[31:19.880 --> 31:21.560]  an area cordoned off
[31:21.560 --> 31:23.940]  immediately behind the end zone.
[31:24.820 --> 31:25.640]  Yeah, you can see it right there.
[31:25.800 --> 31:27.180]  So we're at player level.
[31:27.380 --> 31:29.700]  We just hung out there
[31:29.700 --> 31:31.760]  for a half an hour. They had a hot dog
[31:31.760 --> 31:33.560]  maker. By maker, I mean
[31:33.560 --> 31:34.780]  like a dude that makes hot dogs.
[31:35.100 --> 31:37.340]  They had some really good chili dogs.
[31:38.020 --> 31:38.380]  And
[31:39.940 --> 31:41.160]  sodas. Eric had some beers.
[31:41.340 --> 31:42.860]  We just hung out and chilled out.
[31:43.400 --> 31:44.480]  Here's all the photos of us.
[31:45.320 --> 31:47.300]  And then this guy,
[31:47.380 --> 31:49.460]  this awesome dude, Brad, who works in the marketing department
[31:49.460 --> 31:51.340]  came and grabbed me. Lovely,
[31:51.480 --> 31:53.140]  lovely gentleman. Shout out to Brad.
[31:53.540 --> 31:55.200]  And he took me around to the tunnel
[31:55.660 --> 31:57.420]  and he said, okay, what's going to happen
[31:58.020 --> 31:59.200]  is... and he introduced me to
[31:59.680 --> 32:01.340]  these three dudes that are flag carriers.
[32:01.860 --> 32:03.360]  And he was like, you're just going to follow
[32:03.360 --> 32:05.380]  these guys out, run with them, run where they go,
[32:05.380 --> 32:06.940]  and then I'll collect you at the end.
[32:07.840 --> 32:09.160]  And I go, got it.
[32:09.320 --> 32:11.360]  And then he moved on. And then some
[32:11.360 --> 32:13.420]  lady came up and she goes, alright, do you know what you're going to do?
[32:13.480 --> 32:15.340]  And I said, absolutely. I'm going to run with these three
[32:15.340 --> 32:16.980]  flag guys. I'm going to follow behind them
[32:16.980 --> 32:18.900]  and stay out of their way and just go where they go.
[32:18.920 --> 32:21.220]  And she goes, not at all. You're going to run with
[32:21.220 --> 32:23.420]  the coach who, if you
[32:23.420 --> 32:24.520]  are an NFL fan,
[32:24.980 --> 32:27.500]  you might have heard of, Hines fucking Ward.
[32:27.900 --> 32:29.340]  So I got to run
[32:29.340 --> 32:30.540]  next to Hines Ward
[32:31.060 --> 32:33.360]  onto the field. I waved my hat.
[32:33.360 --> 32:35.260]  They said my name. I was so fucking
[32:35.260 --> 32:37.340]  out of it, pumped up and excited and nervous.
[32:37.580 --> 32:39.160]  I didn't even hear them say my name.
[32:40.020 --> 32:41.440]  And then I ran around with Hines
[32:41.440 --> 32:43.360]  Ward until he walked off the field. I didn't speak to him
[32:43.360 --> 32:45.280]  at all. He looked like he was very focused. He was thinking
[32:45.280 --> 32:46.300]  about plays and shit.
[32:47.020 --> 32:49.360]  But it was an honor to get to be in the same hallway
[32:49.360 --> 32:51.260]  with him. I stood next to all the players.
[32:51.480 --> 32:53.180]  They're all at least a foot taller than me.
[32:53.480 --> 32:55.060]  And I'm six feet tall. That was wild.
[32:55.720 --> 32:57.420]  They're huge. And then
[32:57.420 --> 32:59.540]  that was it. And then we just went back and watched the game.
[33:00.120 --> 33:01.500]  And, oh, I will say, Brad
[33:01.500 --> 33:03.340]  told me, it was very sweet of him, he said, hey, man,
[33:03.400 --> 33:05.420]  I want to let you know, I tried really hard
[33:05.420 --> 33:07.660]  to get them to introduce you as Geoff from F*** Face,
[33:07.760 --> 33:08.540]  but they won't do it.
[33:10.200 --> 33:11.340]  That was one of my questions.
[33:12.900 --> 33:13.620]  I appreciate
[33:13.620 --> 33:15.260]  that he even attempted it.
[33:15.580 --> 33:17.220]  I watched the clip that
[33:17.220 --> 33:19.460]  Emily sent me. I must have watched it
[33:19.460 --> 33:21.380]  six times. You gave it
[33:21.380 --> 33:23.080]  your all. You acted like
[33:23.080 --> 33:25.400]  that was your full-time job, was
[33:25.400 --> 33:27.500]  to be running out with those guys. You did not
[33:28.120 --> 33:29.400]  hang around. I've never
[33:29.400 --> 33:30.860]  seen you move like that. You just
[33:31.320 --> 33:33.580]  look like you wanted to do a really good job
[33:33.580 --> 33:34.340]  of running out.
[33:35.580 --> 33:37.440]  I don't f*** around. Well, let me tell you
[33:37.440 --> 33:39.580]  what happened. I had it in my head
[33:39.580 --> 33:41.320]  I'm running out with this, with Hines
[33:41.320 --> 33:43.340]  Ward, ex-NFL player, right? But he's f***ing old.
[33:43.480 --> 33:45.380]  And the kids in front of me, the flag
[33:45.380 --> 33:47.460]  dudes, they weren't, like, athletes or anything.
[33:47.640 --> 33:49.240]  And they have these big-ass heavy flags.
[33:49.240 --> 33:51.160]  And I thought, I'll just jog out with them.
[33:51.660 --> 33:53.400]  They said, go. Those dudes
[33:53.400 --> 33:55.140]  took off like they were running the 440
[33:55.140 --> 33:56.820]  in the NFL Combine. And
[33:56.820 --> 33:58.780]  I look over and Hines
[33:58.780 --> 34:00.680]  Ward doesn't give a f*** about me. He is
[34:00.680 --> 34:02.540]  booking it. And I had to kick it into
[34:02.540 --> 34:04.660]  another gear to keep up with them.
[34:04.920 --> 34:06.500]  I was like, what
[34:06.500 --> 34:07.240]  the f***?
[34:07.600 --> 34:10.620]  Am I being timed? They were
[34:10.620 --> 34:12.960]  hauling ass. And then I realized, they don't f*** around
[34:12.960 --> 34:15.240]  in professional sports. This was no leisurely
[34:15.240 --> 34:16.940]  lap. They meant
[34:16.940 --> 34:18.720]  business. So yeah, I
[34:18.720 --> 34:20.860]  had to give it my all. Did it not
[34:20.860 --> 34:21.740]  make it on TV?
[34:22.680 --> 34:25.060]  No. I don't think so. I never expected it to.
[34:25.060 --> 34:27.080]  It was sad. Unfortunately, they should
[34:27.080 --> 34:29.100]  have showed that. Instead, they showed Hines Ward in the
[34:29.100 --> 34:30.800]  middle of the field talking about losing.
[34:30.980 --> 34:33.140]  With the other coach. He's like, we're not doing good.
[34:33.260 --> 34:34.040]  How do you handle that?
[34:35.420 --> 34:37.020]  Do you have hot dogs? You ate hot dogs
[34:37.020 --> 34:39.020]  before you ran, Geoff? Because that's more impressive.
[34:39.320 --> 34:40.560]  I had two chili dogs.
[34:40.800 --> 34:42.720]  That was you on two chili dogs.
[34:42.840 --> 34:44.920]  That was me on two chili dogs and a little
[34:44.920 --> 34:47.100]  pecan sandy dessert thing.
[34:47.200 --> 34:47.700]  There we go.
[34:48.640 --> 34:51.120]  I love that you wore the baseball jersey
[34:51.840 --> 34:52.980]  as your attire. I think
[34:52.980 --> 34:54.920]  that's very funny. I wanted to rep
[34:54.920 --> 34:56.020]  F*** Face without
[34:56.740 --> 34:58.420]  putting them in any kind of
[34:58.980 --> 34:59.520]  weird position.
[35:00.320 --> 35:03.140]  And so I thought the F*** Face baseball jersey
[35:03.140 --> 35:05.080]  was A. It doesn't say F*** Face on it
[35:05.080 --> 35:07.020]  in a visible way. It just says FF. I thought that was
[35:07.020 --> 35:08.560]  funny. And then also, what's funnier?
[35:08.900 --> 35:11.240]  What's more F*** Face than wearing a baseball
[35:11.240 --> 35:12.720]  jersey to a football game?
[35:13.260 --> 35:14.900]  Yeah, it's perfect. It's the
[35:14.900 --> 35:16.600]  right attire. Even though I own
[35:16.600 --> 35:18.000]  Brahma's clothes I could have worn.
[35:19.580 --> 35:21.080]  We should have collab merch.
[35:21.960 --> 35:23.100]  Oh, we should collab
[35:23.100 --> 35:24.980]  with the...
[35:24.980 --> 35:25.840]  Face X Brahma's.
[35:26.080 --> 35:28.700]  I hadn't even thought about that. We should make it
[35:28.700 --> 35:30.700]  specifically for the people who are on this podcast
[35:30.700 --> 35:31.780]  and occasionally run out.
[35:34.080 --> 35:35.100]  I want to see
[35:35.100 --> 35:37.100]  Don Zimrow some horns. That's what I want.
[35:37.260 --> 35:38.380]  I want that merch for me.
[35:40.720 --> 35:42.860]  Oh man, imagine if he had horns when he ran at
[35:42.860 --> 35:44.900]  Pedro. He would have been ready if there was a
[35:44.900 --> 35:46.900]  crossover. He had the Brahma's.
[35:47.020 --> 35:47.840]  Yeah, he would have won.
[35:47.840 --> 35:48.780]  He would have won.
[35:49.400 --> 35:51.640]  It was cool to see. I was
[35:51.640 --> 35:53.740]  really thrilled. It was so
[35:53.740 --> 35:55.520]  cool to be in the bullpen. Geoff got
[35:55.520 --> 35:57.720]  kind of whisked away and then we were standing there going
[35:57.720 --> 35:59.560]  oh my god, he's going to do it, he's going to do it and he did it.
[35:59.720 --> 36:01.860]  It was so awesome to
[36:01.860 --> 36:03.900]  see that happen
[36:03.900 --> 36:04.940]  right in front of us.
[36:06.020 --> 36:07.840]  And then when Geoff came back, they were
[36:07.840 --> 36:09.840]  in the middle of the national anthem and
[36:09.840 --> 36:12.040]  Geoff turned the corner and heard that the national
[36:12.040 --> 36:13.820]  anthem was playing and I watched the
[36:13.820 --> 36:15.980]  army kick in within him.
[36:15.980 --> 36:17.800]  He stood...
[36:17.800 --> 36:19.860]  I've never seen Geoff stand up
[36:19.860 --> 36:22.060]  more straight and tall and
[36:22.700 --> 36:23.940]  hand over the heart.
[36:24.020 --> 36:26.020]  It was immediate and then it ended
[36:26.020 --> 36:28.020]  and he walked back over and he's like, hey, what's up?
[36:28.100 --> 36:29.880]  It was so... man,
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  that was beat into you. That was crazy.
[36:32.720 --> 36:33.940]  What am I supposed to do
[36:33.940 --> 36:35.820]  at American sports games as a Brit?
[36:35.960 --> 36:38.020]  Am I supposed to stand for that or is that treason?
[36:38.420 --> 36:40.120]  No, it's not treason. You don't have to put your hand
[36:40.120 --> 36:42.040]  over your heart because that's like a
[36:42.040 --> 36:44.220]  pledge but you can just stand respectfully.
[36:44.220 --> 36:46.020]  That's what I would do. Yeah, I think that's what I did.
[36:46.100 --> 36:47.980]  I just stood there but without my hand.
[36:48.300 --> 36:50.220]  Yeah. You know, as an ex-soldier,
[36:50.340 --> 36:52.400]  you know, it's kind of sad. In the olden
[36:52.400 --> 36:54.040]  days when I was in the military and
[36:54.480 --> 36:55.380]  I was in uniform,
[36:57.200 --> 36:58.180]  I had to salute
[36:58.180 --> 37:00.340]  the flag. Anytime I was
[37:00.340 --> 37:02.280]  within, I think, six feet of it, I had to salute
[37:02.280 --> 37:03.140]  it if it was moving.
[37:04.440 --> 37:06.180]  So like if the flag bearers were like walking through
[37:06.180 --> 37:08.160]  a parking lot and I was within like six feet of it, I'd have to
[37:08.160 --> 37:10.240]  stop and salute it. Maybe ten feet. Could you just take a wide
[37:10.240 --> 37:12.220]  berth? No, I was...
[37:12.820 --> 37:14.280]  No, no, no, I wasn't trying to
[37:14.280 --> 37:14.900]  avoid saluting.
[37:15.880 --> 37:18.260]  I was actually, you know, for all
[37:18.260 --> 37:20.320]  the silliness and nonsense aside,
[37:20.460 --> 37:22.300]  I'm fairly patriotic. I was pretty
[37:22.300 --> 37:24.160]  proud of my five years in the United States Army.
[37:25.080 --> 37:26.360]  I feel pretty good about that.
[37:27.680 --> 37:27.980]  And
[37:29.400 --> 37:30.280]  I love
[37:30.280 --> 37:31.440]  America. It's got some issues.
[37:32.120 --> 37:34.160]  So I actually kind of
[37:34.160 --> 37:36.260]  felt like it was an honor to be
[37:36.260 --> 37:38.320]  able to salute the flag. And
[37:38.320 --> 37:40.020]  when I got out of the military, I
[37:40.020 --> 37:41.480]  lost that right. Yeah.
[37:41.660 --> 37:43.900]  I don't wear a uniform anymore. I'm not allowed to salute
[37:43.900 --> 37:45.920]  out of uniform, and so I can only put my hand over my
[37:45.920 --> 37:47.940]  heart. And it always makes me a little sad that I can't salute the
[37:47.940 --> 37:50.160]  flag anymore. I mean, I guess I could.
[37:50.280 --> 37:51.900]  I guess I fucking could, but it would
[37:51.900 --> 37:53.820]  be against like UCMJ protocol.
[37:53.960 --> 37:55.900]  Which just doesn't matter, but it's just like
[37:55.900 --> 37:57.980]  it is what it is. You're not allowed to
[37:57.980 --> 38:00.440]  salute out of uniform? You're not supposed to
[38:00.440 --> 38:02.020]  salute out of uniform, yeah. Or at least
[38:02.020 --> 38:03.400]  you weren't supposed to back when I was in the Army.
[38:03.780 --> 38:05.200]  Things could change, but I doubt it.
[38:05.720 --> 38:08.160]  I think I've heard that. I've never heard that. That's crazy.
[38:08.680 --> 38:10.280]  Yeah, so I no longer do it.
[38:10.620 --> 38:12.120]  And it's a bummer, because
[38:12.120 --> 38:14.220]  I had one of the, not to brag, but I'm going to,
[38:14.580 --> 38:15.880]  I had one of the best salutes
[38:16.440 --> 38:18.080]  in the entire Army, I think.
[38:19.980 --> 38:22.160]  I was so fucking... I used to
[38:22.160 --> 38:24.240]  practice. Yeah? The entire
[38:24.240 --> 38:26.040]  time I was in the Army, I would practice my salutes.
[38:26.300 --> 38:28.300]  It'd be Wolverine claws, one hand, salute the other hand.
[38:28.360 --> 38:29.980]  Just like I have,
[38:30.200 --> 38:31.660]  you know, because I'm around tons of dudes,
[38:32.080 --> 38:34.480]  I have a perfect, perfectly
[38:34.480 --> 38:35.900]  straight salute arm
[38:35.900 --> 38:37.740]  from tip of my finger to my elbow.
[38:38.020 --> 38:39.860]  It's a perfect wedge. You can't
[38:39.860 --> 38:41.920]  beat it. A lot of people can't get their
[38:41.920 --> 38:44.000]  hand and their arm and their wrist as straight
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.380]  as I can, and so I always felt like
[38:45.740 --> 38:46.960]  I was a bit of a super,
[38:48.440 --> 38:49.880]  a bit of a superstar when it came to
[38:49.880 --> 38:51.940]  saluting. Super saluter. Did we ever
[38:51.940 --> 38:53.880]  put out a video of you and Dan having a
[38:53.880 --> 38:55.700]  salute off? Because Dan salutes...
[38:56.420 --> 38:57.800]  Dan in the British Army has
[38:57.800 --> 38:59.660]  like a different salute.
[38:59.760 --> 39:01.940]  I think the hand is like backwards. Yeah, it's
[39:01.940 --> 39:02.740]  looks... yeah.
[39:04.220 --> 39:05.180]  I think,
[39:05.260 --> 39:06.860]  well, listen, I think it probably
[39:06.860 --> 39:08.940]  came out as a happy hour or something
[39:08.940 --> 39:10.860]  years and years ago. I wouldn't go back
[39:10.860 --> 39:11.540]  and look at it.
[39:13.340 --> 39:14.940]  It probably doesn't hold up.
[39:15.600 --> 39:16.980]  It might be a little offensive
[39:16.980 --> 39:18.240]  in 2023, who knows.
[39:18.980 --> 39:20.600]  We were all drinking back then.
[39:20.720 --> 39:22.520]  We were all friends. Yeah.
[39:23.480 --> 39:24.840]  So anyway, it was
[39:24.840 --> 39:26.220]  awesome. The Brahmins were awesome.
[39:26.580 --> 39:28.660]  Unfortunately, they succumbed to Houston
[39:28.660 --> 39:30.920]  in overtime, but it was also an overtime game.
[39:30.920 --> 39:32.600]  It was only the second overtime game this year.
[39:32.700 --> 39:35.000]  It was fucking cool. It was a crazy
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.840]  ending. Phenomenal. I saw the last
[39:36.840 --> 39:38.900]  quarter. So kind
[39:38.900 --> 39:40.620]  of the Brahmins to reach out to us
[39:40.620 --> 39:42.500]  and to do that and offer us
[39:42.500 --> 39:44.800]  that opportunity. It was really, really, really, really, really
[39:44.800 --> 39:45.760]  cool and I really appreciate it.
[39:47.100 --> 39:48.880]  It was great. The content that came out of it, I think
[39:48.880 --> 39:50.760]  was really funny. Who filmed the Instagram
[39:50.760 --> 39:52.900]  video? Because they did an amazing job.
[39:53.300 --> 39:54.960]  It was perfect camera work. Probably Emily.
[39:55.920 --> 39:57.160]  Emily did fantastic.
[39:57.240 --> 39:59.040]  Just the way it was staged of like the screen
[39:59.040 --> 40:01.060]  and then seeing you run by and then the ending
[40:01.060 --> 40:03.160]  is so perfect of Eric turning around cheering
[40:03.160 --> 40:04.800]  and being so genuinely
[40:04.800 --> 40:07.220]  happy about what's happening. It was great. It's a great video.
[40:07.380 --> 40:08.980]  I'm so glad she did too because
[40:08.980 --> 40:10.960]  it was all such a blur to me. I didn't really
[40:11.380 --> 40:12.900]  experience it. It was like over
[40:12.900 --> 40:14.340]  before it started. You know what I mean?
[40:15.620 --> 40:17.060]  It would have been funny to see you with a
[40:17.060 --> 40:19.060]  GoPro. This is behind
[40:19.060 --> 40:19.960]  Hein's word, Jason.
[40:20.760 --> 40:21.260]  Maybe we should
[40:21.260 --> 40:24.300]  put it up on YouTube or something. I don't know.
[40:24.780 --> 40:26.720]  We put it on social media though.
[40:26.720 --> 40:28.720]  It's on Instagram. Yeah, if people want to see it.
[40:28.880 --> 40:30.480]  It might be other places. I don't know.
[40:30.700 --> 40:32.320]  I tried to post a GIF but I don't think it worked.
[40:32.600 --> 40:34.720]  What about the Nitro?
[40:34.740 --> 40:36.880]  Do we want to get Nitro? Has that happened
[40:36.880 --> 40:38.660]  yet? Has that shifted? It has.
[40:39.040 --> 40:40.080]  Oh, there's the GIF.
[40:42.100 --> 40:42.700]  Oh, it's the
[40:42.700 --> 40:43.960]  salute. What am I looking at here?
[40:44.520 --> 40:46.680]  This is a salute that I think is better than Geoff's.
[40:46.780 --> 40:48.060]  It's the Arnold Rimmer salute.
[40:48.380 --> 40:49.960]  It's not the whole thing. It's some of it.
[40:50.840 --> 40:52.660]  Maybe the best salute on television
[40:52.660 --> 40:54.700]  from Red Dwarf. That's a pretty good salute.
[40:54.700 --> 40:56.820]  I don't know that I can
[40:56.820 --> 40:57.700]  compete with that salute.
[41:00.100 --> 41:00.780]  That's a tough one.
[41:00.780 --> 41:01.840]  I like that you practiced.
[41:02.480 --> 41:04.100]  I appreciate it. You put an effort in.
[41:04.440 --> 41:06.600]  How often would you say you practiced doing that?
[41:06.680 --> 41:08.120]  How much time do you think you invested
[41:08.640 --> 41:10.100]  into having the perfect salute?
[41:15.160 --> 41:16.520]  Not often. Not much.
[41:17.560 --> 41:18.720]  Maybe when you're getting ready
[41:18.720 --> 41:20.560]  in the morning in the mirror, you're like, do I still got it?
[41:21.720 --> 41:22.080]  Yeah.
[41:23.820 --> 41:24.180]  Maybe
[41:24.960 --> 41:26.820]  throw a couple, three or four
[41:26.820 --> 41:28.540]  extra salutes a day in front of the mirror
[41:28.540 --> 41:30.460]  just to make sure you're
[41:30.460 --> 41:32.040]  on point, as they say.
[41:32.920 --> 41:34.700]  I have a question for Gavin, unrelated
[41:34.700 --> 41:36.820]  to all of this. I feel like you've already covered this,
[41:37.120 --> 41:38.320]  but it's strange. I have it in my notes.
[41:38.700 --> 41:40.640]  You said at the end of the last episode
[41:40.640 --> 41:42.840]  I revealed my icing
[41:43.580 --> 41:44.820]  bag thing as
[41:44.820 --> 41:46.960]  a thing that I didn't realize was weird until I stepped away
[41:46.960 --> 41:48.380]  from it. You said you'd have one this week.
[41:48.640 --> 41:49.720]  Do you have one, Gavin?
[41:49.720 --> 41:51.680]  So what was the task
[41:51.680 --> 41:53.640]  again to find out something that's weird? The task was
[41:53.640 --> 41:55.800]  something that you do that's part of your routine
[41:55.800 --> 41:57.920]  that's weird, but you don't really realize
[41:57.920 --> 42:00.040]  it's weird until you take a step back.
[42:00.920 --> 42:01.080]  I
[42:02.100 --> 42:03.340]  almost throw up
[42:03.340 --> 42:04.760]  every time I brush my teeth.
[42:07.970 --> 42:08.990]  I gag
[42:08.990 --> 42:11.810]  maybe four to five times every morning
[42:11.810 --> 42:12.710]  over the sink.
[42:14.350 --> 42:15.490]  Sometimes, if I
[42:15.490 --> 42:17.490]  get a bad day, sometimes the second
[42:17.490 --> 42:21.450]  my tongue touches the toothbrush, I'm like
[42:22.630 --> 42:23.510]  the loudest
[42:23.510 --> 42:25.130]  screaming into the sink
[42:25.130 --> 42:27.150]  in an echoey bathroom.
[42:27.170 --> 42:28.790]  I don't know how Mick puts up with it.
[42:28.810 --> 42:29.350]  I'll just be like
[42:32.450 --> 42:33.330]  Emily does
[42:33.330 --> 42:35.390]  the same fucking thing. Like I have
[42:35.390 --> 42:37.270]  to leave the room when she's brushing
[42:37.270 --> 42:39.210]  her teeth because it's gross to listen to
[42:39.210 --> 42:40.970]  because she gags. I've seen her
[42:40.970 --> 42:43.210]  I haven't seen, I've heard her throw up from
[42:43.210 --> 42:44.830]  brushing her teeth. I've thrown up
[42:45.490 --> 42:46.770]  maybe once every
[42:47.450 --> 42:50.590]  three months from brushing my teeth
[42:50.970 --> 42:51.750]  I'll just go like
[42:51.750 --> 42:54.650]  and like a half a cup of liquid will fly out
[42:55.410 --> 42:56.290]  and it's awful
[42:56.290 --> 42:57.890]  and I talked about this on
[42:58.550 --> 42:59.970]  probably in a Let's Play years ago
[42:59.970 --> 43:02.110]  and it doesn't happen to me anymore because I live in Austin
[43:02.110 --> 43:04.450]  but when I used to live in England, the second I would
[43:04.450 --> 43:06.470]  leave the house on a cold morning, I would gag
[43:08.930 --> 43:10.610]  something about the cold air
[43:10.610 --> 43:12.190]  like coming from a warm house
[43:12.190 --> 43:13.670]  I would just open the door
[43:14.070 --> 43:16.590]  the cold air would hit me in the face and in the middle
[43:16.590 --> 43:17.390]  of just like
[43:17.950 --> 43:19.690]  imagine it like a suburbia
[43:19.690 --> 43:21.490]  movie, I'm just like opening my door and closing
[43:21.490 --> 43:22.370]  it behind me and then going
[43:22.950 --> 43:24.430]  and then walking to school
[43:25.890 --> 43:27.530]  what an eventful walk to school
[43:27.530 --> 43:27.930]  for you
[43:28.770 --> 43:31.470]  this is the walking to school episode
[43:33.350 --> 43:35.350]  maybe that was the transitional moment
[43:35.350 --> 43:36.850]  between me and Errol
[43:37.190 --> 43:39.350]  I love that you didn't
[43:39.350 --> 43:41.070]  put any of that on a character
[43:41.070 --> 43:43.130]  that's just you, you're owning that
[43:43.130 --> 43:45.030]  that's just me becoming Errol
[43:47.430 --> 43:49.670]  that's like your body fighting as Errol takes over
[43:50.890 --> 43:52.990]  so temperature change, brushing your teeth
[43:52.990 --> 43:54.730]  is there anything else that just randomly
[43:55.770 --> 43:57.490]  obviously you have other triggers
[43:57.490 --> 43:59.310]  but I mean in that way
[43:59.310 --> 44:00.010]  sometimes
[44:00.950 --> 44:03.350]  if the AC has been blasting and I get out
[44:03.350 --> 44:04.770]  of a hot bath or shower
[44:04.770 --> 44:06.930]  I'll get hit with the same coldness
[44:06.930 --> 44:08.450]  and I'll gag as well
[44:08.450 --> 44:10.190]  usually as I'm reaching for my towel
[44:10.190 --> 44:12.150]  I'll just gag again
[44:12.750 --> 44:15.050]  do you ever gag when you're blowing Dan?
[44:15.050 --> 44:15.790]  what?
[44:17.770 --> 44:18.830]  what now?
[44:19.850 --> 44:21.390]  when you're giving blowjobs
[44:21.390 --> 44:22.450]  to Dan, do you ever gag?
[44:28.150 --> 44:29.170]  your silence
[44:29.170 --> 44:30.850]  tells me the answer is yes
[44:32.730 --> 44:33.850]  I'm stunned
[44:36.130 --> 44:37.070]  it'd be a great
[44:37.070 --> 44:38.410]  time for Errol to show up
[44:38.970 --> 44:41.110]  with a witty zinger back at him
[44:44.540 --> 44:45.700]  alright well that's a
[44:45.700 --> 44:47.420]  that was a yes for Gavin
[44:47.420 --> 44:48.800]  what's next?
[44:50.560 --> 44:51.680]  a yes or a no
[44:51.680 --> 44:52.740]  and like a wondering why
[44:54.060 --> 44:55.100]  so temperature
[44:55.820 --> 44:57.000]  causes you to gag?
[44:57.880 --> 44:58.640]  yeah I think so
[44:58.640 --> 45:01.420]  not sure why, but I think that's something that
[45:01.420 --> 45:03.340]  is pretty regular for me and is
[45:03.340 --> 45:05.740]  pretty abnormal but I'm just used to it
[45:05.740 --> 45:07.480]  I have friends
[45:07.480 --> 45:09.320]  I have like two friends that when they
[45:09.320 --> 45:11.300]  step outside from inside
[45:11.300 --> 45:13.040]  and it's sunny out, they'll sneeze
[45:13.580 --> 45:15.020]  is it like that?
[45:15.160 --> 45:16.860]  do you step outside and gag?
[45:17.400 --> 45:19.040]  yeah, I mean if it's cold, yeah
[45:19.040 --> 45:19.600]  definitely
[45:20.420 --> 45:22.460]  do you ever gag from cold food?
[45:22.640 --> 45:23.720]  like a popsicle?
[45:24.340 --> 45:24.620]  no
[45:25.880 --> 45:29.020]  what if you have like minty gum that's like really fresh?
[45:29.500 --> 45:30.180]  no it doesn't do it
[45:30.180 --> 45:31.360]  maybe if I inhaled
[45:31.960 --> 45:34.760]  if I put a popsicle in a mug
[45:34.760 --> 45:37.160]  or a thermos and I just sucked it
[45:37.160 --> 45:37.900]  maybe I would gag
[45:37.900 --> 45:40.000]  if I just opened it and huffed it
[45:40.500 --> 45:41.760]  because you saw Eric
[45:41.760 --> 45:43.960]  on New Year's Eve, I couldn't
[45:43.960 --> 45:45.700]  even be around my cold drink that day
[45:45.700 --> 45:48.120]  but I think that was the bubbles from the
[45:48.640 --> 45:49.340]  ginger beer
[45:52.740 --> 45:54.020]  so, sudden temperature
[45:54.020 --> 45:56.040]  change can cause this, like going from
[45:56.040 --> 45:58.060]  hot to cold or cold to hot, is it both ways
[45:58.060 --> 45:59.680]  or is it just one way? it's just hot to cold
[46:00.200 --> 46:01.140]  hot to cold
[46:01.780 --> 46:03.860]  I wonder if we could trigger this in some way
[46:03.860 --> 46:05.880]  have you ever tried to go cold to hot?
[46:07.460 --> 46:08.040]  well yeah
[46:08.040 --> 46:08.880]  every time I leave the house
[46:08.880 --> 46:09.220]  yeah
[46:11.780 --> 46:14.080]  there was something you were going to do in the next
[46:14.080 --> 46:15.380]  episode, what was it?
[46:16.620 --> 46:17.060]  apple
[46:17.720 --> 46:19.200]  so you're going to try the apple
[46:19.200 --> 46:22.040]  can you also get a mug and fill it
[46:22.040 --> 46:24.300]  with ice and see if we can trigger your gag
[46:24.300 --> 46:26.060]  for the next episode also
[46:26.060 --> 46:28.080]  and we're just doing like experiments on you
[46:28.080 --> 46:29.020]  is that? yeah
[46:30.260 --> 46:32.060]  I'm just imagining him being
[46:32.060 --> 46:34.000]  like strapping 20
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.260]  ice packs to him and a porta potty
[46:36.260 --> 46:38.200]  and then having him step out into the sun
[46:38.200 --> 46:40.240]  after like 3 minutes if he just starts
[46:40.240 --> 46:40.900]  gagging
[46:42.440 --> 46:44.360]  I feel like it's easier to go from
[46:44.360 --> 46:46.580]  being cold to hot than hot to cold
[46:46.580 --> 46:47.960]  like simulating that
[46:47.960 --> 46:50.420]  maybe before we do this to strumming or whatever
[46:50.420 --> 46:52.100]  we just fill that thing with ice
[46:52.100 --> 46:54.020]  and I'll just walk in there and you
[46:54.020 --> 46:55.680]  can see if you hear the gags
[46:59.450 --> 47:00.310]  you just want
[47:00.310 --> 47:01.170]  like raw ice?
[47:02.290 --> 47:02.930]  I love
[47:03.770 --> 47:06.070]  the idea of filling the toilet with ice
[47:06.070 --> 47:08.150]  it's just ice cubes coming out
[47:08.150 --> 47:09.710]  would it make it cold in there?
[47:09.830 --> 47:10.230]  probably would
[47:10.930 --> 47:13.570]  it would reduce temperature I'd certainly assume
[47:13.570 --> 47:14.790]  I don't know if it would be cold enough
[47:14.790 --> 47:17.650]  I don't know what the temperature range is required for you to gag
[47:17.650 --> 47:19.770]  what the minimum shift is
[47:19.770 --> 47:22.110]  I would say fill it with dry ice but I think I would die
[47:22.110 --> 47:23.310]  yeah no that would
[47:23.310 --> 47:25.210]  that would not work
[47:25.210 --> 47:27.450]  yeah it would be like you sitting in your office
[47:27.450 --> 47:29.030]  when the cats breathe all over you
[47:31.390 --> 47:33.610]  it would be like 20 cats in a porta potty
[47:36.070 --> 47:37.430]  ha ha ha ha
[47:37.970 --> 47:39.510]  god this is a real freak show
[47:39.510 --> 47:41.950]  and we have one more
[47:42.590 --> 47:43.910]  this might be weirder than
[47:43.910 --> 47:45.550]  all the foot shit you were trying to put on me
[47:45.550 --> 47:46.450]  oh man
[47:48.330 --> 47:49.790]  I think we gotta try
[47:50.450 --> 47:51.530]  we gotta try it
[47:51.530 --> 47:53.630]  when is the fish thing supposed to arrive?
[47:54.170 --> 47:56.210]  it should be here in like the next couple
[47:56.210 --> 47:58.010]  weeks it has to ship
[47:58.010 --> 47:59.650]  from the UK
[47:59.650 --> 48:01.950]  and genuinely I don't know how UK shipping goes
[48:01.950 --> 48:04.270]  right now with like COVID stuff so I'm just waiting
[48:04.630 --> 48:05.230]  that's fair
[48:05.230 --> 48:07.410]  are we gonna do smelling salts as well?
[48:07.550 --> 48:09.590]  should we have like a range of things for him to try?
[48:09.730 --> 48:11.290]  man we're really gonna beat the shit out of Geoff
[48:11.290 --> 48:13.290]  well I feel like
[48:13.810 --> 48:15.490]  some smelling salts I feel like
[48:15.490 --> 48:17.610]  I don't know if that would be worse or better
[48:18.170 --> 48:18.530]  realistically
[48:20.250 --> 48:21.550]  I'm in high school all over again
[48:21.550 --> 48:23.170]  just people beat the shit out of me all day long
[48:23.910 --> 48:26.470]  like say you're in there and we crack the can
[48:26.470 --> 48:27.850]  and we throw it in there with you
[48:27.850 --> 48:30.170]  how long realistically do you think you're gonna be stood in there?
[48:30.490 --> 48:32.610]  I mean if my flaps
[48:32.610 --> 48:34.810]  work the way I think they do I could stay in there
[48:34.810 --> 48:35.370]  indefinitely
[48:37.370 --> 48:38.270]  gotta find out
[48:38.270 --> 48:40.810]  is there a Guinness world record for the longest
[48:40.810 --> 48:42.190]  can we get Guinness involved?
[48:42.810 --> 48:44.650]  I mean we could right but it's just
[48:44.650 --> 48:46.990]  that's the whole thing you have to pay them they have to fly out
[48:46.990 --> 48:48.690]  yeah I don't think they're gonna give a fuck
[48:48.690 --> 48:49.850]  but yeah I can try
[48:50.690 --> 48:52.450]  why do they give a shit about anything else?
[48:52.810 --> 48:53.990]  because they're getting paid
[48:54.930 --> 48:56.170]  we pay for it
[48:56.590 --> 48:58.770]  it's expensive we looked into this a few years
[48:58.770 --> 49:00.470]  ago I wanted to do a show
[49:00.470 --> 49:02.170]  where we break Guinness records
[49:03.270 --> 49:04.470]  like dumb Guinness
[49:04.470 --> 49:06.450]  records that are easy to break and it's like
[49:06.450 --> 49:08.110]  10 grand to get one of those Guinness
[49:08.110 --> 49:09.930]  what? it's not that much
[49:09.930 --> 49:10.890]  at least it was back then
[49:10.890 --> 49:13.970]  that's pre-covid I feel like it would be more now
[49:13.970 --> 49:15.090]  it might be more now
[49:15.090 --> 49:18.090]  I mean it's worth exploring
[49:18.090 --> 49:20.170]  I want to send you guys a photo
[49:21.270 --> 49:22.430]  somebody send this in to the
[49:22.430 --> 49:24.570]  f***face Instagram and I want to see
[49:25.330 --> 49:26.510]  see if you guys notice anything
[49:26.510 --> 49:27.510]  funny about this photo
[49:28.010 --> 49:28.950]  okay so Geoff
[49:28.950 --> 49:31.870]  it's a photo of sloppy joes
[49:31.870 --> 49:33.590]  you can finally see what the camera looks like
[49:34.310 --> 49:34.710]  oh
[49:34.710 --> 49:37.610]  so that's what the audience sees when they're walking down the street
[49:37.610 --> 49:39.190]  and they see a sloppy joes camera
[49:39.190 --> 49:41.170]  and they react to it that's what they're looking at
[49:42.030 --> 49:43.230]  and I was like oh cool
[49:43.230 --> 49:45.210]  it's cool to finally see it and then I noticed something
[49:45.210 --> 49:47.070]  that made me laugh for about an hour straight
[49:47.070 --> 49:48.570]  and I want to see if you guys notice it
[49:49.650 --> 49:51.050]  there's a mic above it
[49:51.050 --> 49:53.730]  that's what it is that's the f***ing audio mic
[49:53.730 --> 49:54.530]  from the camera
[49:54.530 --> 49:58.210]  They just have an XLR hooked up to a fucking...
[49:59.310 --> 50:01.970]  Like a band mic and it's hanging from...
[50:02.630 --> 50:08.970]  It's hanging from a pole in the roof, which is why sometimes when it's making a thup-thup-thup-thup noise
[50:08.970 --> 50:12.790]  I realize it's just windy and the mic is just hitting against the wall back and forth.
[50:14.270 --> 50:15.950]  Look at that fucking setup.
[50:17.510 --> 50:19.650]  That's almost more professional...
[50:20.670 --> 50:22.730]  That I expect. That's a professional mic, right?
[50:23.270 --> 50:27.930]  I mean, it's the same mic the bands are using inside, I guess. Wouldn't you want more of a shotgun, though, for it to be
[50:27.930 --> 50:32.810]  pointed in front of the camera? Yeah, yeah, there's a lot that you could want more of. I don't think they give a fuck.
[50:34.110 --> 50:37.130]  I think they would. We pointed the camera. You got it.
[50:37.910 --> 50:41.770]  Everything I learned about Sloppy Joe's is more fascinating than the last thing I learned.
[50:41.850 --> 50:44.470]  It's really... The fact that that is their setup is
[50:45.170 --> 50:46.990]  fantastic to me. Crazy. That's all.
[50:47.530 --> 50:51.010]  Do you have any interest in actually going to Sloppy Joe's at this point?
[50:51.110 --> 50:55.450]  I apologize if we talked about this, but you've become so invested in the exterior.
[50:56.010 --> 50:58.870]  Do you care at all about going to the physical place?
[50:59.170 --> 51:04.530]  Yeah, I would like to. I would like to... I would like to bring a little launcher and sit under the camera and just
[51:06.030 --> 51:07.050]  experience it firsthand.
[51:07.990 --> 51:11.090]  I'm sure at some point I will go... we will go check it out.
[51:11.090 --> 51:14.530]  Maybe if you're saying their setup isn't the most ideal,
[51:14.770 --> 51:21.970]  you could initiate some sort of trade with the Sloppy Joe's people. It could be great for the museum. Maybe a future item.
[51:22.030 --> 51:29.590]  I don't imagine this will fit before this upcoming RTX, but the idea of having the Sloppy Joe's mic is such a weird collectible.
[51:29.930 --> 51:36.050]  It is... that is interesting. Like maybe if they upgrade I could... Oh, yeah, that's great. That's a good idea.
[51:36.130 --> 51:38.730]  It would be good for the museum. Speaking of the museum,
[51:38.730 --> 51:46.750]  I think it's been announced, but we're doing a f***face museum of oddities and things that are things at RTX and
[51:46.750 --> 51:50.810]  so if you go to RTX in Austin this year, which is, I don't know, sometime in July,
[51:51.090 --> 51:57.310]  I think, Eric, you have probably a date. July 7th through 9th. Tickets available at rtxaustin.com. You can go check out the
[51:58.010 --> 52:00.830]  the actual f***face museum, our first version of it.
[52:01.090 --> 52:05.490]  You know, I talked about this about a year ago about wanting to take it on the road and do Ripken's Believe It Cuz Why Not.
[52:06.530 --> 52:12.270]  And this is essentially gonna be the first version of that. Oh, Ripken, that's funny. It's like Ripley, Ripken.
[52:12.710 --> 52:15.570]  Yeah, yeah, I got it. No, I got it as soon as I said I'm an idiot, but that's very funny.
[52:16.470 --> 52:19.950]  It's also, we mentioned that like a year ago. Yeah.
[52:20.890 --> 52:26.150]  Well, now we're doing it. Yeah, no, I mean just for Andrew to get in the joke. Yeah, no, I forgot it.
[52:26.190 --> 52:32.690]  I forgot the joke. Then I thought Geoff Flubb. Then as I was correcting him, I realized I'm an idiot. That's a really funny joke.
[52:33.550 --> 52:38.710]  And there's no way, the plane was, I couldn't reverse it. We're locked in. I just hit the crash.
[52:40.550 --> 52:44.970]  So we'll be doing that. We'll have a lot of weird stuff. You can see like the baseball bat where
[52:44.970 --> 52:50.490]  Geoff signed all the baseballs with it. And maybe Owl Owl and Puss Puss. Like there's a lot happening.
[52:50.870 --> 52:58.950]  And, and. F***face rock. Yes, and. F***face rock. A thing that must be seen to be believed. You can see it.
[52:59.650 --> 53:06.190]  Come see it. You know what it is. You know exactly what it is. So come see it. It's the ultimate thing.
[53:06.450 --> 53:13.130]  Can I, can I pitch a completely impractical idea that would be in my head funny for RTX, but
[53:13.130 --> 53:17.490]  almost certainly won't happen? Oh, please do. It's not, it's not too late in the game at all.
[53:17.630 --> 53:23.810]  No, this is timely. It would be great if we had a giant canvas, because you have Geoff's bat that
[53:23.810 --> 53:29.930]  he did all the autographs with, right? If we had a giant canvas that people could dip the bat into
[53:29.930 --> 53:35.490]  paint and then swing and paint a canvas of the swings, the bat swings, because a lot of paint
[53:35.490 --> 53:40.630]  flies off that bat. Could do essentially other people's attempts at Geoff's signature on this
[53:40.630 --> 53:47.770]  giant canvas. Two stations, one green, one purple. Yeah, even better. There you go. An idea that you
[53:47.770 --> 53:54.390]  would not see at RTX. Yeah, I'll definitely get that set up at RTX for sure. We'll use latex interior house paint.
[53:54.650 --> 53:58.970]  Yeah, let me, let me go talk to the convention center. Yeah, so we want people to swing bats,
[53:59.130 --> 54:03.350]  but it's not to hit anything. It's just so paint flies everywhere. You guys are cool with that, right?
[54:04.310 --> 54:08.510]  Well, you can do like a Dexter kill room and they step into it and they swing a bat with paint.
[54:08.510 --> 54:19.930]  That's perfect. It's easy. Dexter kill room. Great, man. You might be able to see Errol.
[54:22.150 --> 54:27.170]  Wait, what does that mean? Is it just a photo? Well, this, you just opened up a whole set of
[54:27.170 --> 54:32.030]  questions. Are there photos of Errol that aren't you? Has there ever been? The mud in the tombstone.
[54:32.590 --> 54:38.030]  Oh, okay. I see. Yeah, I was thinking that you taking it like you might physically be a little
[54:38.030 --> 54:43.670]  bit different in some way in these characters. You walk with a slightly different gait. You like
[54:43.670 --> 54:49.370]  have a toothpick. He's just got a little bit of a smirk. Yeah. You know, he's about, you know,
[54:49.390 --> 54:55.110]  he's up to, he's about to be cheeky. Oh yeah. Then I walk over to the RT store booth. I gag
[54:55.110 --> 55:04.730]  and I start knocking all the shelves. It's cold over here. There's a, there's a pretty good chance
[55:04.730 --> 55:09.610]  you might even get to see my PS5 footstool that I use when I'm recording. There's all kinds of
[55:09.610 --> 55:16.370]  stuff. It's very exciting. Oh, by the time this is out, uh, all of, does it do will have come out.
[55:16.470 --> 55:21.750]  Yes, that is true. Yeah. So go back. If you haven't seen them that you can see seven total
[55:21.750 --> 55:25.890]  episodes. Yes, that's right. Oh. And the hall of do will probably be in the museum as well,
[55:25.930 --> 55:32.310]  actually. We do have some new merch coming out. I know we need to wrap up, but I want to let
[55:32.310 --> 55:38.010]  people know that we have some new stuff coming out. We will have a, uh, protected by Falcon sign
[55:39.470 --> 55:48.770]  and, and we will also have a, I we've never done it before. A face vinyl in episode. I'm so excited
[55:48.770 --> 55:54.530]  on vinyl. Uh, I think we're looking at that coming out. Gosh, I think like early June,
[55:54.650 --> 55:59.610]  late May, something like that. So, uh, follow us at face pod on Instagram, on Twitter, and we'll
[55:59.610 --> 56:03.930]  keep you updated on those things. Uh, there's a lot going on. And by vinyl, he means vinyl record.
[56:03.990 --> 56:08.010]  Yes. It is a vinyl record. It is the whole episode pressed. I've heard it. I've listened
[56:08.010 --> 56:11.750]  to the whole thing. It is the episode and it is on vinyl. You listen to it on the vinyl.
[56:12.250 --> 56:16.530]  Am I what? Like you'd listen to the actual record or you listen to the file. No, no,
[56:16.550 --> 56:22.390]  I have the vinyl record at my house. I had to listen to it to proof it. Yeah. Oh, I'll even,
[56:22.550 --> 56:28.530]  I'll even say this, uh, that vinyl record that Eric has has made an appearance in a few pieces
[56:28.530 --> 56:32.910]  of content in the back as an Easter egg and nobody's noticed it, but it's been on camera
[56:32.910 --> 56:37.250]  a few times. It's in the background of a couple social things for a couple different things
[56:37.250 --> 56:42.230]  around. So it's, it's really awesome. I can't believe we made it. It's real and it's crazy.
[56:42.950 --> 56:48.810]  Took about two years to make, but we did it. And by we, Nick, Nick did most of the work,
[56:49.270 --> 56:55.510]  Nick and Ecom. Oh, we'll also have Gerplers. We'll also have Gerplers soon. Um, great. So
[56:55.510 --> 57:01.830]  there'll be some, uh, some stuff, blind boxy kind of stuff going on. So you can, uh, we'll have an
[57:01.830 --> 57:07.070]  update on that stuff soon at face pod on Instagram and on Twitter. You can stay up to date with
[57:07.070 --> 57:11.650]  everything. Um, but we do need to wrap this one up. I'm very sorry. We were just on a little bit
[57:11.650 --> 57:18.350]  of a time crunch. Will that be any golden GURPS RTX? Man, that's a good question. Let me see
[57:18.350 --> 57:25.490]  what I can do. What if one was inserted into the store? So limited. I don't know. So limited. We
[57:25.490 --> 57:29.890]  are so limited. Let me see what I can do. Let me see what I can get. And then we'll, we'll go.
[57:30.010 --> 57:34.570]  Are they, they're selling before the event, right? They are. That is correct. It would be cool. If
[57:34.570 --> 57:39.550]  you get a golden GURP and you're going, there should be a thing where if you, you could like
[57:39.550 --> 57:44.110]  show that you had it and that gets you something. I don't know. I'll tell you what, I'll tell you
[57:44.110 --> 57:52.830]  what. If you show me your golden GURPLER at RTX on the floor, I will walk you over to the store
[57:52.830 --> 57:57.370]  and give you free merchandise. Wow. How about that? And you'll pull out the claws one more time.
[57:58.350 --> 58:01.970]  Maybe I'll put a little snicked snicked. You never know.
[58:04.530 --> 58:10.790]  All right. There you go. That's an episode of F*** Face in the can. 151. We did it. Thanks
[58:10.790 --> 58:15.810]  to Pat Gavendale. Thanks to Raymond Sommer. Thanks to Geoffrey Paul Wright and the other two.
[58:15.950 --> 58:20.650]  We'll see you next week. Don't forget to like and review and rate and subscribe and tell everybody
[58:20.650 --> 58:27.430]  that you've ever met to listen to the F*** Face podcast. Because if you don't, uh, well, we don't
[58:27.430 --> 58:41.250]  want to find out what happens. What? I'm going to go blow dad. Don't gag. Hey guys. Major League fan
[58:41.250 --> 58:47.030]  Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face. That dog is long. Geoff is frosting.
[58:47.030 --> 58:53.590]  The F*** Face waffle maker is awesome. Lots of supplemental content is incoming. How far would
[58:53.590 --> 58:59.350]  you sink in pancake sand? How long is your back? And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[58:59.810 --> 59:02.430]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
