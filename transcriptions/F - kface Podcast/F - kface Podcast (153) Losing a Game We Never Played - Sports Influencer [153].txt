[00:00.000 --> 00:01.240]  You ever wonder why we're here?
[00:05.860 --> 00:07.900]  It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?
[00:19.030 --> 00:23.210]  Last episode of this show, we talked about Thomas the Bumbler.
[00:27.990 --> 00:30.890]  We talked about gurping a scarlet.
[00:32.450 --> 00:34.910]  We talked about waffles.
[00:35.450 --> 00:37.950]  We talked about best fast food burger.
[00:37.950 --> 00:39.910]  We talked about our drafts.
[00:39.950 --> 00:42.870]  We talked about Gavin's ice and apple.
[00:43.630 --> 00:46.850]  Because he had the huffing of the ice and the eating of the apple.
[00:47.370 --> 00:49.570]  We talked about pancake lengths.
[00:50.870 --> 00:52.330]  We screamed about backs.
[00:53.210 --> 00:55.330]  Oh no, I didn't measure my back!
[00:55.830 --> 00:57.310]  Oh no, I know, I forgot something.
[00:57.750 --> 01:00.490]  Sleeping on ice and I've been in the lab.
[01:00.810 --> 01:03.650]  Those are the titles for the previous episode.
[01:03.830 --> 01:04.650]  So you have them.
[01:05.930 --> 01:10.790]  I went to a coffee shop today and I compiled all my notes.
[01:10.810 --> 01:13.110]  And I have 16 items for today.
[01:13.490 --> 01:14.730]  That's cool because Andrew said,
[01:14.850 --> 01:16.890]  I don't know how these are going to go because I really don't have much.
[01:17.210 --> 01:18.370]  I've got too much.
[01:19.210 --> 01:20.590]  I'm sure we won't get to most of it.
[01:21.390 --> 01:22.590]  I'm coming in loaded.
[01:23.190 --> 01:24.950]  Loaded? Geoff's loaded?
[01:26.250 --> 01:27.130]  With ideas.
[01:27.650 --> 01:28.930]  Yeah, I'm pregnant with creativity.
[01:29.530 --> 01:32.330]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:32.550 --> 01:33.690]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:34.810 --> 01:35.770]  Andrew Panton.
[01:36.150 --> 01:38.070]  And GavyGavGav3.
[01:38.670 --> 01:40.650]  This is episode 153.
[01:42.210 --> 01:42.470]  Hello.
[01:43.590 --> 01:44.070]  Hello.
[01:44.990 --> 01:45.690]  How's everybody doing?
[01:46.050 --> 01:47.030]  I'm good, how are you?
[01:47.610 --> 01:49.310]  Yeah, hey, Eric wants to take a guess at something.
[01:49.850 --> 01:51.350]  I think Nick is wearing the mask today.
[01:51.710 --> 01:53.810]  Oh shit! Really?
[01:54.250 --> 01:55.330]  You're going for an official guess?
[01:55.510 --> 01:58.870]  That is my official guess.
[01:59.730 --> 02:04.290]  I just, I heard, it sounded, I think it sounded a little muffled.
[02:04.650 --> 02:05.470]  It could be distance.
[02:05.670 --> 02:07.490]  So I will say it could be distance.
[02:07.690 --> 02:09.230]  But I feel like we haven't guessed.
[02:09.730 --> 02:12.070]  And I feel like he's trying to be a sneaky monkey.
[02:12.550 --> 02:14.150]  And I feel like today is the day.
[02:14.450 --> 02:15.630]  Ooh, you're wrong.
[02:16.390 --> 02:16.990]  God damn it!
[02:17.610 --> 02:20.170]  So you can't guess until we've all guessed.
[02:20.570 --> 02:21.850]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:22.210 --> 02:25.210]  Okay, well, we got four other, three other shots at this.
[02:25.530 --> 02:28.450]  Can we also just check, Nick, that you haven't done it yet.
[02:28.510 --> 02:30.150]  And we haven't, we just didn't realize.
[02:30.530 --> 02:32.610]  Oh, that's an interesting question, Gavin.
[02:33.930 --> 02:34.350]  Because...
[02:34.850 --> 02:37.170]  I may have, in fact, been in the mask.
[02:37.970 --> 02:38.770]  To this point.
[02:40.070 --> 02:42.870]  Oh wait, no, this is a very confusing thing.
[02:43.150 --> 02:44.870]  This is like a me thing that I've done.
[02:44.950 --> 02:46.070]  Have you or have you not?
[02:46.230 --> 02:48.330]  Because are we just going to continue to guess if you're wrong?
[02:48.650 --> 02:49.370]  I did it, yeah.
[02:49.610 --> 02:51.610]  He did it! We missed it.
[02:51.810 --> 02:53.070]  That's so disappointing!
[02:53.110 --> 02:53.590]  Are you serious?
[02:54.190 --> 02:56.350]  Here you go!
[02:57.330 --> 02:58.170]  Oh shit!
[02:58.430 --> 03:00.110]  What episode?
[03:02.830 --> 03:04.310]  Post Condor Man?
[03:05.430 --> 03:07.010]  You did it!
[03:07.370 --> 03:09.790]  The Post Condor Man one?
[03:09.990 --> 03:10.890]  What number was that?
[03:13.390 --> 03:14.070]  149?
[03:14.270 --> 03:15.270]  I think it was 149.
[03:15.690 --> 03:17.370]  Oh, I'm so annoyed!
[03:17.710 --> 03:19.270]  I am so upset!
[03:20.770 --> 03:22.110]  We suck!
[03:24.310 --> 03:25.890]  Oh my god!
[03:26.370 --> 03:28.050]  We are so bad at this!
[03:28.050 --> 03:29.070]  That is so good!
[03:30.450 --> 03:34.010]  He's taking a picture in front of the newspaper!
[03:34.830 --> 03:37.110]  In the basketball game!
[03:38.110 --> 03:40.990]  It was the start of March Madness, I had to be sure.
[03:42.130 --> 03:42.850]  Oh man!
[03:43.030 --> 03:46.170]  So how psyched were you when the episode ended and no one asked?
[03:46.330 --> 03:49.330]  Oh, I was so... because people actually did call it out in some of the comments.
[03:49.390 --> 03:50.210]  So I was like, oh god, oh god.
[03:50.470 --> 03:50.830]  Really?
[03:51.590 --> 03:54.470]  Yeah, a couple of people were like, Nick's out of muffled that one.
[03:55.070 --> 03:55.550]  And I did.
[03:55.550 --> 04:01.090]  And I thought for sure, because I think at one point you called out for something for me, Gavin, and I was like, oh shit.
[04:01.430 --> 04:04.490]  So I opened the mouth ever so slightly to be like, hello!
[04:07.990 --> 04:11.650]  That has really bummed me out. You've done amazing there, Nick.
[04:11.810 --> 04:12.510]  You did great.
[04:12.990 --> 04:16.290]  I just didn't ever consider that you'd be wearing glasses under there.
[04:18.510 --> 04:21.970]  Me neither! Wait a second, you are wearing glasses under there!
[04:22.210 --> 04:23.850]  I've never thought about that!
[04:23.850 --> 04:28.410]  We've been doing face jam forever and I've never thought about you wearing glasses under there.
[04:28.630 --> 04:29.790]  Do you normally wear glasses?
[04:30.330 --> 04:35.450]  I do when I'm not wearing contacts. And so, since I was home that day, I just wore glasses.
[04:35.670 --> 04:37.810]  They're your basketball and news glasses.
[04:39.270 --> 04:40.730]  It's so I can read and see.
[04:42.650 --> 04:46.910]  The photo of you in the newspaper is the funniest thing I've ever seen.
[04:47.850 --> 04:53.830]  I love that the equivalent of that is a picture of the news website. There's no actual newspaper anymore.
[04:55.370 --> 04:57.810]  So what does this mean? Do we do it again?
[04:58.530 --> 05:00.770]  I'd say that's one nil to Nick.
[05:01.210 --> 05:02.190]  That's true!
[05:02.650 --> 05:07.390]  And it resets all our guesses. Sadly, the guess reset had actually already occurred.
[05:08.930 --> 05:11.730]  I'm so mad. I still don't get a guess?
[05:12.090 --> 05:13.790]  I think you've technically used it.
[05:14.610 --> 05:23.170]  I feel so dumb. Geoff, Gavin and I standing in front guarding the door with our bullet just waiting and it already ended a month ago.
[05:23.950 --> 05:27.050]  We need to be way more aggressive in firing.
[05:29.290 --> 05:34.750]  I don't even feel like I played. I just lost a game I didn't even play. I never even started.
[05:35.090 --> 05:36.150]  Did you ever throw out a guess?
[05:36.530 --> 05:36.910]  No!
[05:37.870 --> 05:40.730]  What was the criteria? Was it six months?
[05:41.610 --> 05:43.170]  Yeah, until the end of the year, right?
[05:43.570 --> 05:45.610]  Okay, so from here to the end of the year.
[05:46.950 --> 05:49.270]  I guess it gets slightly easier for us.
[05:49.430 --> 05:51.390]  Does it just start in 2024?
[05:53.110 --> 05:56.630]  Well, he might have just won 2023 and that's it.
[05:56.630 --> 05:57.250]  So we're done?
[05:57.570 --> 06:01.090]  It's April. We're going to wait until 2024 to do this?
[06:01.350 --> 06:02.850]  No, that makes sense.
[06:03.510 --> 06:08.910]  If you lose the Super Bowl, you don't just get to call for another Super Bowl a month later so you can try again.
[06:09.070 --> 06:14.970]  Did you stop guessing if Nick is wearing a monkey mask is the Super Bowl to us?
[06:15.270 --> 06:16.730]  I think it's our Super Bowl, yeah.
[06:16.830 --> 06:20.510]  I don't think that's our Super Bowl.
[06:20.510 --> 06:21.670]  Nick won the season.
[06:21.850 --> 06:28.390]  He did great. We need to figure out how many bullets we have. Can we just fire one at a time?
[06:28.690 --> 06:32.130]  We need to work this out. We need to get together for the next season of this.
[06:32.470 --> 06:34.430]  Here's what we should do. We have eight months to prepare.
[06:34.910 --> 06:38.890]  Yeah, and there's four of us, so we should each focus on a quarter, right?
[06:39.630 --> 06:40.530]  Oh, yeah.
[06:41.010 --> 06:46.150]  It's on us to be on top of our game for that quarter, for those 12 recordings.
[06:46.190 --> 06:47.090]  I like that idea a lot.
[06:47.170 --> 06:48.070]  That's great.
[06:50.510 --> 06:51.790]  I'd like to take Q1 2024.
[06:52.310 --> 06:52.990]  I'll take Q2.
[06:54.230 --> 06:55.930]  I'll take Q2.
[06:56.030 --> 06:58.070]  Andrew, do you want Q3 or do you want Q4?
[06:58.410 --> 07:03.810]  I mean, I might as well take Q4. I feel like neither of us are going to... our shots aren't going to matter by Q3 or Q4.
[07:03.850 --> 07:05.290]  We're kind of out of the game already.
[07:05.790 --> 07:07.370]  Q4 is 18 months away.
[07:07.370 --> 07:09.330]  18 months from now. Put me in Q4.
[07:09.330 --> 07:15.510]  Also, this doesn't make any sense because if we all only get one guess, if Geoff guesses...
[07:16.410 --> 07:17.510]  Wait, Gavin, are you Q1?
[07:18.450 --> 07:18.850]  Yeah.
[07:20.510 --> 07:26.430]  The first week of February and then he wears it the last week of February. Are none of us going to guess it?
[07:26.670 --> 07:34.170]  Well, look, we're all guessing. We're all in control. I'm just going to say I'm going to have an extra ear out in Q1. We can all guess whenever.
[07:34.850 --> 07:35.090]  Okay.
[07:35.210 --> 07:37.410]  I thought we had zones.
[07:37.990 --> 07:41.470]  It's like your zone to pay special attention to.
[07:41.570 --> 07:41.870]  Okay.
[07:42.210 --> 07:44.990]  I'm marking him, but feel anyone can tackle him, you know?
[07:45.310 --> 07:45.650]  Okay.
[07:47.170 --> 07:48.790]  Anyone can tackle him.
[07:48.790 --> 07:56.010]  So if I blow my load sort of mid Q1 and there's still four weeks left, anyone can still go.
[07:56.390 --> 08:00.250]  Okay. Well, Nick, congratulations on apparently winning our Super Bowl.
[08:00.250 --> 08:01.570]  I can't believe that.
[08:01.650 --> 08:02.090]  Perfect season.
[08:03.150 --> 08:05.190]  Way to go, man. Wow.
[08:05.570 --> 08:10.050]  This is good, though, because now we have 2024 content that we have to get to.
[08:10.530 --> 08:16.290]  Eric, can we get a trophy made to present to Nick?
[08:16.970 --> 08:17.530]  Yeah.
[08:18.790 --> 08:21.190]  Let me note that I'll get a monkey trophy.
[08:22.270 --> 08:23.870]  Do we want it to be a monkey?
[08:24.090 --> 08:25.030]  I think so.
[08:25.350 --> 08:28.510]  Okay. I'm putting it on the list.
[08:28.790 --> 08:33.490]  Or a trophy of like a baseball player or a bowler or something that we could put a tiny little monkey hat on.
[08:33.750 --> 08:34.510]  Oh, okay.
[08:36.170 --> 08:37.190]  Oh, I like that idea.
[08:37.330 --> 08:43.770]  I think whatever it is, it should have a plaque that we can engrave every year and then it just gets moved back and forth.
[08:44.330 --> 08:45.470]  Like the Stanley Cup.
[08:45.630 --> 08:47.050]  Yeah, exactly like the Stanley Cup.
[08:47.050 --> 08:48.030]  Oh, that's brilliant.
[08:48.810 --> 08:51.290]  I like the idea of it having like a hat that's like removable.
[08:51.610 --> 08:56.790]  So if Nick gets it, he gets the mask on it. And if we get it, we get a mask list.
[08:56.970 --> 08:59.170]  Or the mask is just under our foot.
[08:59.570 --> 09:01.230]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[09:01.470 --> 09:02.490]  Stepping on the mask?
[09:03.030 --> 09:06.750]  And then I think that every year at RTX it could be in a trophy cabinet.
[09:07.370 --> 09:07.810]  Okay.
[09:08.170 --> 09:10.050]  We could put it in the museum.
[09:10.570 --> 09:10.810]  Okay.
[09:11.950 --> 09:14.690]  Wow, we really nailed down these rules. I'm excited about next year now.
[09:14.690 --> 09:15.610]  This is great.
[09:16.170 --> 09:20.830]  This is something I feel like everyone forgot. So I guess I'm really excited for 2024.
[09:21.490 --> 09:22.430]  I do think...
[09:22.430 --> 09:27.910]  My 18 month from now window is when I'm paying special attention to when he's wearing a mask.
[09:29.930 --> 09:35.770]  I think that Nick has to announce his win at the end of the recording though.
[09:36.190 --> 09:37.230]  Oh, interesting.
[09:37.810 --> 09:43.130]  So after the final sign off from Geoff, Nick comes in and says, I was wearing the mask.
[09:43.130 --> 09:45.690]  Because then our reaction will be on camera.
[09:46.130 --> 09:52.490]  Now, let me pause at this. If it starts 2024 and we record our first episode of 2024.
[09:52.790 --> 09:57.490]  Let's just say that we record the first week of January. And none of us want to make that guess.
[09:58.170 --> 10:03.810]  And Nick says, I did it. I win. Are we just rolling on to 2025?
[10:04.890 --> 10:06.310]  Based on these rules, yeah.
[10:07.050 --> 10:09.470]  That's how professional sports works, man.
[10:09.510 --> 10:10.530]  This is insane.
[10:10.530 --> 10:15.830]  But I will say, there's going to be a hell of a lot of scrutiny the first recording of 2024.
[10:17.370 --> 10:18.890]  I'm going to have my ears peeled.
[10:20.190 --> 10:23.130]  There's going to be a let's interview Nick section every episode.
[10:25.450 --> 10:31.510]  Wow. Okay. Well, Nick, congratulations. We'll be working on your trophy imminently.
[10:31.630 --> 10:34.750]  And then we'll give it to you in a special ceremony.
[10:34.750 --> 10:40.950]  Really going to need to lean in on the audience to remind us when it's close to 2024 to do this.
[10:41.130 --> 10:44.970]  In the exact same way you guys did with the fireplace video.
[10:45.390 --> 10:48.130]  Where you go, hey, weren't they supposed to put out a fireplace video in like two weeks?
[10:48.150 --> 10:49.190]  And we went, oh, fuck.
[10:49.810 --> 10:52.850]  Because there's every chance we would forget to guess the entire year.
[10:53.010 --> 10:55.250]  And also Nick might just forget to wear it the whole year too.
[10:55.430 --> 10:55.890]  Oh, absolutely.
[10:57.270 --> 11:01.950]  I mean, Nick could go the whole year and never wear it and win.
[11:03.150 --> 11:04.350]  I could win by default.
[11:05.030 --> 11:06.610]  No, I think that's a DQ.
[11:06.790 --> 11:08.010]  No, I think he has to wear it.
[11:08.450 --> 11:10.510]  He has to wear it in one episode.
[11:10.790 --> 11:16.790]  No, hang on. Because if I guess the first, let's just say four weeks in a row, we make our guesses.
[11:17.550 --> 11:22.390]  And Nick is not wearing the mask in those four, like, we just happen to guess the first four weeks.
[11:22.530 --> 11:26.570]  No, then he has to wear a mask the next episode to officially be declared the winner.
[11:27.610 --> 11:30.250]  But then we can't guess it. So he would win by default.
[11:30.250 --> 11:33.150]  Nobody has to wear it once. He has to do it once.
[11:33.350 --> 11:37.890]  What it is, is that no one should blow their final guess if like half the year is left.
[11:38.470 --> 11:42.170]  Yeah. Well, also like if he never wears it, then he could just time us out.
[11:42.290 --> 11:45.430]  You can't reward inactivity of the no mask.
[11:46.330 --> 11:47.770]  Like that's too much of a counter.
[11:48.990 --> 11:50.730]  I think it has to. He has to wear it once.
[11:51.170 --> 11:52.710]  What if it was quarterly?
[11:53.350 --> 11:54.530]  No, this is crazy.
[11:55.290 --> 11:58.070]  No, Andrew, that's not how professional sports work.
[11:58.070 --> 12:02.270]  If every quarter is a season, everybody gets an opportunity.
[12:02.730 --> 12:04.210]  We should do it sooner rather than later.
[12:04.350 --> 12:05.030]  It's already complicated.
[12:05.230 --> 12:10.810]  Here's what we'll do. We'll do it every year, but every four years, there'll be a World Cup.
[12:11.270 --> 12:13.890]  And then it can potentially happen twice that year.
[12:15.330 --> 12:15.810]  I like that.
[12:16.410 --> 12:19.730]  That's what the World Cup is to you? You do it twice?
[12:20.170 --> 12:20.650]  You do a bonus.
[12:20.750 --> 12:25.450]  Well, the World Cup is like a separate bowl, isn't it? It's like a separate thing to win.
[12:25.450 --> 12:28.350]  And it happens the same year as a Super Bowl.
[12:29.350 --> 12:30.670]  Not the same sport.
[12:30.930 --> 12:31.490]  What about...
[12:32.790 --> 12:35.550]  Can we go to three maybe? What if the Olympics are on?
[12:35.670 --> 12:38.190]  Can we add the Olympics into this event of categories?
[12:38.550 --> 12:42.330]  We still have a whole separate Olympics thing we gotta do.
[12:42.430 --> 12:47.410]  Let's not cross contaminate our leagues.
[12:47.950 --> 12:53.150]  I just keep looking at this one picture of Nick in front of the San Diego State game that is cracking me up.
[12:54.330 --> 12:55.110]  Oh, man.
[12:55.450 --> 12:59.870]  You're incredibly good at taking selfies and knowing where your entire monkey head is.
[13:00.050 --> 13:01.190]  They're really well framed.
[13:03.510 --> 13:05.770]  It's a learned skill, let me tell you.
[13:07.130 --> 13:07.950]  Oh, man.
[13:08.550 --> 13:10.770]  Well, better luck next year, guys.
[13:12.050 --> 13:12.970]  Back to the drawing board.
[13:12.990 --> 13:13.850]  I'm so disappointed.
[13:16.290 --> 13:21.130]  Are you guys gonna do any kind of ear training in the off-season?
[13:22.070 --> 13:26.550]  Well, I'm gonna be definitely listening to that episode and seeing what it sounds like.
[13:27.330 --> 13:30.630]  I feel the worst because, like Gavin, you don't do pleasantries.
[13:30.790 --> 13:32.890]  I would have had pleasantries with Nick that day.
[13:32.970 --> 13:34.250]  I would have had more of an opportunity.
[13:34.950 --> 13:38.250]  Well, I assume you didn't attend pleasantries in the mask.
[13:38.870 --> 13:40.390]  I think I did.
[13:40.890 --> 13:41.790]  Are you serious?
[13:42.130 --> 13:43.850]  I think I committed to the bit.
[13:44.570 --> 13:46.070]  Well, I mean, none of us did.
[13:46.670 --> 13:48.750]  Anybody that was at pleasantries didn't catch it.
[13:48.830 --> 13:50.730]  But you always have the most pleasantries with Nick.
[13:51.530 --> 13:52.630]  Oh, no, it depends.
[13:52.870 --> 13:54.170]  It's not necessarily true.
[13:54.290 --> 13:56.030]  Sometimes Eric joins in first.
[13:56.590 --> 13:58.390]  Oh, Eric wasn't there that day.
[13:58.910 --> 13:59.910]  Eric wasn't there?
[14:00.430 --> 14:01.810]  That's a tough one.
[14:01.970 --> 14:04.090]  That puts a lot of weight.
[14:04.090 --> 14:06.090]  I de-hued myself automatically. That's rough.
[14:06.530 --> 14:07.010]  That's hard.
[14:07.930 --> 14:10.070]  Because I would have known. I think I would have heard it and I would have gone,
[14:10.470 --> 14:11.630]  Yo, this guy's wearing this mask.
[14:12.150 --> 14:13.930]  How does it feel to have missed the big game?
[14:16.830 --> 14:18.070]  It feels terrible.
[14:18.070 --> 14:21.250]  And then to show up on a different day where the game is not being played,
[14:21.290 --> 14:24.090]  only to lose and have to wait a year to play again.
[14:25.290 --> 14:26.910]  Eric couldn't attend the game.
[14:27.110 --> 14:30.110]  I was on the wrong field the entire time thinking I was ready.
[14:30.350 --> 14:31.930]  That's like not even shooting.
[14:32.050 --> 14:33.290]  I feel like I didn't even participate.
[14:34.610 --> 14:37.450]  Losing a game you never played in is very funny.
[14:38.090 --> 14:41.930]  That is truly, I think, the definition of this show.
[14:42.130 --> 14:43.270]  That's really something else.
[14:45.730 --> 14:47.810]  That's crazy. I can't believe we lost.
[14:48.550 --> 14:48.950]  Already.
[14:50.190 --> 14:50.270]  Fuck.
[14:50.530 --> 14:54.530]  Oh, wow. I really thought he was going to put a reminder in his phone.
[14:55.290 --> 14:57.370]  Like, do this in September or something.
[14:57.710 --> 14:59.590]  After we'd long, long forgotten about it.
[14:59.790 --> 15:02.410]  I thought it would be way later in the year.
[15:02.810 --> 15:05.590]  Is the Rock Draft out by the time this comes out?
[15:07.350 --> 15:10.330]  This will be out...
[15:11.610 --> 15:12.410]  May 10th.
[15:12.430 --> 15:15.110]  Yeah, we can put out the Rock Draft at the time of this recording.
[15:15.530 --> 15:16.750]  I think we can do...
[15:16.750 --> 15:18.790]  I wanted to talk to you guys in between recordings on this,
[15:18.890 --> 15:20.950]  but we have Condor Man, we have Rock Draft.
[15:21.310 --> 15:23.550]  We can have Rock Draft out by the time this comes out, yes.
[15:23.750 --> 15:25.230]  So if you want to talk about Rock Draft, go for it.
[15:25.510 --> 15:27.750]  We also have Mall Draft and Sloppy Joe's.
[15:27.850 --> 15:28.870]  We do, yes.
[15:29.030 --> 15:31.310]  And that's probably the order these are going to go in,
[15:31.390 --> 15:32.510]  but we can mix it up also.
[15:33.510 --> 15:35.670]  Do you want to say something about the Rock Draft, Gavin?
[15:35.730 --> 15:36.330]  Yeah, go for it, Gavin.
[15:36.350 --> 15:37.830]  Well, if that's the case, I have a clip.
[15:39.390 --> 15:39.710]  Okay.
[15:41.230 --> 15:41.850]  Oh, no.
[15:42.250 --> 15:43.270]  You have a clip?
[15:43.270 --> 15:44.390]  Oh, no.
[15:45.190 --> 15:46.850]  Yeah, I got a clip.
[15:47.090 --> 15:48.510]  I hate whenever Gavin has a clip.
[15:48.990 --> 15:51.370]  So, first Rock pick I picked, can you see that?
[15:51.530 --> 15:52.490]  Rock Candy.
[15:52.850 --> 15:54.530]  I picked that because...
[15:54.530 --> 15:56.010]  Oh, did you hear Eric then?
[15:56.050 --> 15:57.130]  I heard Eric say, good pick.
[15:57.810 --> 15:59.890]  Let me wind on a little bit.
[16:00.110 --> 16:02.630]  That is a dog shit.
[16:02.870 --> 16:03.330]  Terrible.
[16:05.470 --> 16:08.570]  Not even a minute later, Eric has flipped.
[16:09.230 --> 16:11.330]  Eric is now saying, terrible pick.
[16:11.330 --> 16:14.970]  So, let me defend myself and tell you why I'm right yet again.
[16:16.650 --> 16:23.310]  I am trying to be, as a producer, supportive of ideas when they are brought out.
[16:23.330 --> 16:24.570]  Sounds like you're trying to be full of shit.
[16:24.770 --> 16:29.230]  And so, what happens sometimes is a bad idea will come out.
[16:30.950 --> 16:37.410]  And, initially, I'll go, I don't know about this, fellas, but you got to be like, hey, rah, rah, let's do it.
[16:37.410 --> 16:43.490]  But then you really think about it, and when one of you starts dogpiling on, baby, let's go for it, because now I'm not alone.
[16:43.730 --> 16:57.770]  However, I will say, I was absolutely turned later in the episode, where, after Gavin was going to pick Rock Candy, I was proven wrong.
[16:58.850 --> 17:04.510]  And Rock Candy was absolutely a good pick.
[17:05.150 --> 17:06.470]  So, you flipped twice.
[17:07.710 --> 17:08.670]  Absolutely, 100%.
[17:08.670 --> 17:20.010]  Sometimes, I think the first flip, I was being supportive, just as a knee-jerk reaction, and then really just like, okay, I'm not going to hammer on this one.
[17:20.230 --> 17:22.350]  And then you started getting hammered, so I joined in the hammering.
[17:24.390 --> 17:34.610]  But then, as time makes fools of us all, as they say, as time occurred and Rock Candy would have been chosen.
[17:34.610 --> 17:42.370]  Yeah, it's like a weird thing, right, where if Geoff wanted Rock Candy, that's where he had to take it, but that doesn't mean it's a good pick.
[17:42.650 --> 17:45.330]  Like, they both just wanted a kicker in the first round.
[17:45.590 --> 17:51.130]  It seems like, and this is, I guess, why I feel this way, I don't think Andrew would ever take Rock Candy.
[17:51.470 --> 17:55.410]  I also don't think Nick would ever take Rock Candy, and I don't think I would either.
[17:55.670 --> 17:58.890]  They just aren't on the list of things that I think we would choose.
[17:59.730 --> 18:14.790]  Gavin, as you said, plainly throughout the recording, you didn't understand what we were doing, or why your picks were bad, or why Andrew was getting on you about it.
[18:14.950 --> 18:18.450]  So you were truly a wild card that I could not have anticipated.
[18:18.930 --> 18:23.910]  So that's why Rock Candy I wouldn't think would be so hot, but then, man, you proved me wrong.
[18:23.910 --> 18:31.550]  If you haven't listened to our Rock Not Rock draft, make sure you do. It's probably one of the most combative pieces of content we've ever made.
[18:31.810 --> 18:33.010]  It's really something.
[18:34.250 --> 18:37.070]  And then we immediately rolled into the most wholesome one.
[18:38.410 --> 18:41.590]  Which probably isn't out yet, but yeah, look out for the mall draft as well.
[18:42.890 --> 18:47.590]  Do you feel you understand the draft at this point, Gavin? You've now done three of them.
[18:48.010 --> 18:50.490]  I don't think there's any need to ask me that right now.
[18:52.170 --> 18:52.950]  I'm getting it.
[18:54.850 --> 18:56.090]  Well, let's do a few more.
[18:59.470 --> 19:02.710]  Please let me know when you get it fully. I can't wait.
[19:03.090 --> 19:06.370]  I hope we do continue to do drafts. I don't know what the next one would be.
[19:07.050 --> 19:09.170]  I don't think we've landed anything yet, but it is a lot of fun.
[19:09.290 --> 19:10.690]  They're really fun. They're great.
[19:11.730 --> 19:20.830]  Speaking of fun stuff we've done, this wasn't... I was telling them in pleasantries, Gavin, I have 16 things to talk about today.
[19:20.830 --> 19:24.210]  I figured we won't get to 14 of them.
[19:25.210 --> 19:31.450]  But since we brought up the Rock Draft, I was thinking about how we're kind of in between movies right now.
[19:31.610 --> 19:36.890]  We've kind of done the childhood trilogy of movies.
[19:37.910 --> 19:40.810]  Condor Man from my childhood, The Monkey Movie from yours.
[19:41.310 --> 19:43.530]  I didn't understand. Yeah, I got it. Totally.
[19:44.550 --> 19:48.070]  Get off the Rock Draft, stop being combative. That was weeks ago.
[19:48.870 --> 19:53.990]  And I was just thinking about all the other movies that I would like to do and stuff that would be fun.
[19:54.090 --> 19:55.650]  And I was kind of brainstorming a list of movies.
[19:56.030 --> 20:02.710]  And then it hit me, but none of it had DNA from the show in it, where I felt like there was enough of a through line to make it make sense.
[20:02.950 --> 20:09.490]  And then it hit me, there was that period where I was telling you guys about the Dracula movie that I watched in high school that I could never find.
[20:09.570 --> 20:11.310]  And then we finally identified it on the show.
[20:11.790 --> 20:15.190]  Would you guys ever want to watch Dracula AD 1972 with me?
[20:15.230 --> 20:16.230]  Yeah, I mean, why wouldn't I?
[20:16.230 --> 20:18.390]  Like, that would be fun, right?
[20:19.070 --> 20:20.670]  Yeah, it's a great movie.
[20:21.210 --> 20:22.970]  Look at that poster. So what year was it made?
[20:23.710 --> 20:24.710]  Probably 1972.
[20:25.330 --> 20:26.810]  It is 1972, yes.
[20:27.810 --> 20:29.610]  Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.
[20:29.870 --> 20:30.930]  Yeah, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing.
[20:32.110 --> 20:34.410]  Peter Cushing was the first Doctor Who, wasn't he?
[20:34.730 --> 20:35.810]  No. Wasn't he?
[20:36.190 --> 20:37.930]  I thought William Hartnell was first, don't you?
[20:38.010 --> 20:38.990]  That might have been him.
[20:39.510 --> 20:41.130]  Christopher Lee as Dracula sounds great.
[20:41.570 --> 20:43.650]  Peter Cushing...
[20:43.650 --> 20:45.010]  Who was the first?
[20:45.250 --> 20:46.290]  God, I gotta look it up now.
[20:46.730 --> 20:47.270]  First Doctor Who.
[20:48.690 --> 20:51.130]  So is this, I don't remember anything about this movie.
[20:51.250 --> 20:53.330]  Is this just a standard Dracula tale?
[20:53.410 --> 20:57.410]  Or like, what is the thing of Dracula AD 1972?
[20:57.750 --> 21:04.630]  Well, after we watched it, or after we identified it, I watched it and really enjoyed it and was thinking, I remember none of it.
[21:04.710 --> 21:07.490]  I really, it completely left my mind after I solved the mystery.
[21:07.570 --> 21:08.150]  So I don't know.
[21:08.790 --> 21:10.370]  I know I watched it like two years ago.
[21:11.090 --> 21:11.570]  Yeah, there you go.
[21:13.670 --> 21:14.390]  Do you know what?
[21:14.970 --> 21:18.430]  In that picture, I'm pretty sure he's younger than Brad Pitt.
[21:18.670 --> 21:18.930]  Really?
[21:18.950 --> 21:19.970]  How old is he?
[21:20.670 --> 21:21.070]  Whoa.
[21:23.190 --> 21:24.510]  People looked old back then.
[21:25.390 --> 21:25.790]  Really?
[21:27.030 --> 21:28.330]  How old do you think he is?
[21:28.630 --> 21:31.710]  How old was William...
[21:31.710 --> 21:32.810]  I don't know.
[21:33.210 --> 21:34.310]  When he played the Doctor.
[21:35.210 --> 21:40.830]  If you were to look at that guy, Geoff, just looking at his face, what name would you give him if you didn't know his name?
[21:40.890 --> 21:41.990]  Does he look like anything to you?
[21:43.970 --> 21:48.750]  I watched that era of Doctor Who religiously as a kid.
[21:48.950 --> 21:51.930]  So the first thing I think of when I see him is just that Doctor Who from my childhood.
[21:52.190 --> 21:52.850]  That's fair.
[21:53.270 --> 21:54.910]  It was 58.
[21:55.290 --> 22:01.610]  If I didn't, I would think he was an evil snake oil salesman who was coming to town to steal money.
[22:03.150 --> 22:05.690]  He does have evil snake oil salesman vibes.
[22:06.090 --> 22:06.950]  That's very funny.
[22:07.330 --> 22:10.950]  He would be a part of the carnival in Something Wicked This Way Comes.
[22:10.950 --> 22:17.930]  Yeah, he would be in a side story in Red Dead Redemption that was memorable for how shitty the guy was.
[22:18.090 --> 22:18.490]  Absolutely.
[22:20.150 --> 22:22.050]  58? That's pretty old.
[22:23.590 --> 22:27.030]  I don't know, he looks 58-ish to me. Maybe I've been a little bit older.
[22:27.290 --> 22:28.130]  But Brad Pitt's 59.
[22:28.510 --> 22:30.450]  I think just Brad Pitt looks great for his age.
[22:31.130 --> 22:33.310]  I don't think this guy looks bad for 58.
[22:33.650 --> 22:35.270]  He absolutely looks bad for 58.
[22:35.350 --> 22:36.150]  You think so?
[22:37.810 --> 22:40.370]  I assume he's a wig and he's aged up.
[22:41.770 --> 22:46.590]  He looks like he's on a day trip out from the home.
[22:48.950 --> 22:50.310]  Like the retirement home.
[22:50.990 --> 22:54.910]  I feel like the black and white is really hurting him as well. It's doing him no justice.
[22:55.530 --> 22:58.390]  I think it was filmed in black and white.
[22:59.050 --> 23:01.590]  Somebody black and white that picture of Brad Pitt and see if it makes a difference.
[23:02.310 --> 23:03.050]  I think it will.
[23:04.770 --> 23:06.210]  I think you'll look much older.
[23:06.450 --> 23:07.930]  I disagree. Look at that.
[23:08.630 --> 23:10.230]  What era of Brad Pitt is that?
[23:10.390 --> 23:12.930]  You said look at that as if you were right.
[23:13.210 --> 23:18.150]  I said look at that because it's the size of a fucking postage stamp. I had to zoom in.
[23:19.850 --> 23:21.910]  Also, he's like 10 years younger than that.
[23:22.710 --> 23:23.550]  That's not a comparable.
[23:24.390 --> 23:28.530]  I don't know, you're just sending me black and white photos of Brad Pitt with no context to how old he is.
[23:28.630 --> 23:29.390]  This is doing nothing.
[23:32.270 --> 23:33.710]  That might be an older Brad Pitt.
[23:36.210 --> 23:39.370]  Brad Pitt has taken a lot of black and white photos is what I'm learning.
[23:40.150 --> 23:41.950]  Yeah, he's a movie star.
[23:41.990 --> 23:45.930]  That looks like a schemer right there. That's like, ooh, I got something planned.
[23:46.490 --> 23:50.050]  That looks like a guy trying to listen and see if someone's inside a mask.
[23:53.350 --> 23:55.390]  That's me Q1 of next year.
[23:58.930 --> 24:00.830]  Saying that's you is maybe a little strong.
[24:00.870 --> 24:03.570]  I love that. Oh yeah, that's a picture of Brad Pitt.
[24:03.710 --> 24:06.470]  That's me listening to see if Nick is wearing a monkey mask.
[24:10.670 --> 24:13.170]  Some vampire Dracula AD 1970.
[24:13.390 --> 24:15.150]  I would definitely watch that. Yeah, absolutely.
[24:15.290 --> 24:20.630]  I think it'd be fun. We don't have to do it tomorrow or anything, but I think it'd be fun.
[24:20.870 --> 24:30.010]  Speaking of, the last thing we did together, I think, was the Sloppy Joe's bingo, right?
[24:30.510 --> 24:34.070]  Which, I guess, won't be out at this point.
[24:34.330 --> 24:38.330]  I feel like it's a higher priority than the other stuff.
[24:38.670 --> 24:40.430]  Okay, I mean, we can put it out next.
[24:41.130 --> 24:43.350]  What's coming out this week that's not f*** face?
[24:43.950 --> 24:47.570]  Well, nothing. I mean, this is the week that we're recording, so nothing is coming out this week.
[24:47.570 --> 24:48.730]  Yeah, we're done with does it do.
[24:49.170 --> 24:52.190]  We should start putting up one of these every week.
[24:52.590 --> 24:55.510]  Okay, well, tomorrow's Friday, so it's not coming out tomorrow.
[24:55.910 --> 24:56.530]  So next week.
[24:56.970 --> 24:58.690]  Yeah, no, I got you for next week, man.
[25:01.230 --> 25:02.150]  That's what I'm talking about. 100%.
[25:02.150 --> 25:05.650]  I don't want to push Condor Man forever or the Rock or the Mall Draft.
[25:05.770 --> 25:08.550]  I just feel like we're in our Slop era right now, you know?
[25:08.890 --> 25:15.710]  I feel like Sloppy Joe's is done and can come out next week, and then we can have the Rock Draft the week after.
[25:16.090 --> 25:17.170]  Yeah, that's how it feels to me.
[25:17.410 --> 25:19.650]  Does it still come out before this episode?
[25:19.770 --> 25:19.970]  Yes.
[25:20.450 --> 25:22.510]  Okay, can we just talk about how much fun it was?
[25:23.090 --> 25:24.910]  I had a really nice time hanging out with you guys.
[25:25.290 --> 25:28.130]  It was fun. I've played it independently twice.
[25:28.130 --> 25:29.630]  Have you? How did it go?
[25:30.590 --> 25:41.330]  It went pretty well. I wanted to see what Slop O'Clock was really like, so I did it Friday night at like 11.30ish until maybe like 1am.
[25:41.350 --> 25:42.090]  How did it compare?
[25:42.550 --> 25:46.050]  I still haven't seen anyone in a wheelchair, which I'm real mad about.
[25:46.290 --> 25:49.470]  That's crazy. That's crazy. That's so easy.
[25:50.190 --> 25:56.450]  It's funny trying to like, as you do it, so we all did it together for the first time outside of Geoff.
[25:56.810 --> 26:04.450]  And you had such a handle on everything, Geoff, where I feel like we were all like, holy shit, there is 16 different things that can happen,
[26:04.670 --> 26:09.410]  and I'm trying to watch all of it simultaneously, and it's kind of hard to wrap your head around.
[26:09.610 --> 26:15.270]  Doing it two more times, you get such a better perspective on what you're looking for, and it becomes even more fun.
[26:15.450 --> 26:18.650]  I think as you do it more, it was a lot of fun. I enjoyed it.
[26:18.650 --> 26:29.010]  I started to proof the Sloppy Joes video, and as Geoff is talking about looking out for pink taxis, like two seconds before one went by and no one noticed.
[26:31.110 --> 26:38.550]  I think that's a great part of that content, is the stuff that we're just going to completely miss, that maybe like shifts the game in some way.
[26:38.990 --> 26:44.910]  Yeah, I think it's something that the old Achievement Hunter audience never seemed to pick up on, with us at least,
[26:44.910 --> 26:49.950]  is that it's impossible to talk and pay attention in equal measure, at the same time.
[26:50.710 --> 26:54.690]  Something's going to slip, right? Like you're going to miss something in a video game, or you're going to miss something in a live stream,
[26:54.770 --> 26:58.010]  if you're paying attention to trying to be entertaining, or point stuff out.
[26:58.850 --> 27:02.870]  But you're right, like the more you do it, the better you're able to parse everything.
[27:03.210 --> 27:08.690]  It's kind of like how they talk about how like when an NBA player hits that elite level, the game slows down for them.
[27:09.130 --> 27:12.970]  Like Sloppy Joes really, Duval Street really slows down at some point.
[27:12.970 --> 27:15.990]  Yeah, that's a great way to feel like you can take it all in.
[27:16.290 --> 27:18.870]  It does, I feel like I'm getting a grasp on the playbook.
[27:19.130 --> 27:24.830]  And it gets exciting when you have different cards, because you made like nine cards, and like, ah shit, I don't have this in this one.
[27:25.270 --> 27:31.130]  I don't know if I have a full bingo from like five hours of watching from my original card yet.
[27:31.230 --> 27:34.670]  I think I'm missing it, well wheelchair I still definitely don't have, there might be another one I'm missing.
[27:35.130 --> 27:40.330]  I mean it's like, some days that's how it goes, you know, there was one night I did it where I filled my card and like left it.
[27:40.330 --> 27:46.170]  That's great. Have you seen the wheelbarrow with beer in it? Is that a thing?
[27:46.650 --> 27:46.670]  No!
[27:48.190 --> 27:49.550]  It's a wheelbarrow.
[27:50.510 --> 27:56.550]  Barrow? I did that again, didn't I? That was a thing we did before. Fuck, I haven't learned. Wheelbarrow.
[27:56.910 --> 27:58.010]  I ain't learned that slip twice.
[27:58.630 --> 28:07.590]  No, but it's, wheelbarrow sounds so bad. It's a wheelbarrow, wheelbarrow sounds, a wheelbarrow of beer sounds way more fun than a wheelbarrow of beer.
[28:07.590 --> 28:18.030]  But anyway, there was a guy that had a wheelbarrow filled with beer and he kept walking up and down past Sloppy Joe's. He did it like twice.
[28:18.630 --> 28:28.950]  And I just thought it was such a weird thing to see. And then like 15 minutes after he did it, a security guy walked up to another security guy and was like, did you see the wheelbarrow guy with beer? Like we're trying to track that guy down.
[28:28.950 --> 28:32.190]  I think he was just selling beer independently on the street.
[28:33.870 --> 28:43.830]  Nobody, they're like, where is he? And then like 15 minutes after that, I saw him walk down the street completely empty. It was totally empty and nobody saw him. Once again, just walked by.
[28:43.910 --> 28:49.490]  I was like, hey, get away! Escape! It's so much fun. You create these narratives when you watch around like what's happening.
[28:49.890 --> 28:56.250]  It is funny because it's like you're watching a story that you're, you feel, you realize you're the only audience of.
[28:56.250 --> 29:05.650]  Yes. And it makes it feel so much more, I don't know, like you're like, I'm recording this happening in history right now. I'm the only person that's paying attention to this.
[29:05.970 --> 29:16.810]  Like when you watch a TV show, if loss doesn't end in a way I like, I can be mad at Damon Lindelof. If I never see the wheelbarrow guy again, I just, there's nothing I can do. Like, I'm just upset with the world.
[29:17.330 --> 29:28.150]  There's no guarantee of any resolution to any of these narratives, which makes them feel like there's a higher stake almost in them and my investment of like, I need to see how this plays out.
[29:28.490 --> 29:29.730]  Is someone going to arrest him?
[29:30.710 --> 29:38.910]  I really, I really hope we do it again. I hope we got it. It would be insane if we didn't. Yeah, I mean, I'm doing it all the time at home anyway.
[29:39.310 --> 29:42.030]  Are we just going to see if the people like it and then do more?
[29:42.370 --> 29:44.750]  I think they will, but we should. Yeah, probably.
[29:45.310 --> 29:49.330]  I'm just, I mean, regardless, I'm going to be playing it independently. I'm excited.
[29:49.350 --> 29:54.330]  It is one of those things where you just catch yourself when you're bored at home, you're like, let me pop down over to Sloppy Joe's and see if I can do a quick bingo.
[29:55.470 --> 30:04.210]  Yeah, I haven't had that, but Slop O'Clock. I'm excited to go on other days. Like, I tried to do it last night, but I couldn't get the live stream to work.
[30:04.370 --> 30:10.650]  It was down yesterday. I don't know if it's back up. It was down for, I thought it was rare for it to go down. Apparently it goes down like once a week.
[30:12.350 --> 30:18.430]  Yeah, it goes down so much now that it no longer scares me when it goes down. It's like, I'm like, all right, it'll be back up eventually.
[30:18.590 --> 30:20.950]  In your experience, what do you think is the least sloppy day?
[30:22.890 --> 30:28.650]  Oh, there's a base level of slop in that place for sure. I'd say Tuesday.
[30:29.510 --> 30:30.150]  Tuesday's are low.
[30:32.190 --> 30:41.030]  There's some energy to Monday. Tuesday's kind of a dud. Wednesday is like hump day. People are excited to drink. Thursday, it's close to the weekend.
[30:41.410 --> 30:57.230]  Friday is prime slop. Saturday is double prime slop. And then Sunday, there's a pretty large percentage of people that had so much fun on Friday and Saturday, they want to continue it into the last day of the weekend before they have to go back to their miserable lives wherever they live.
[30:57.230 --> 30:59.750]  So Sundays are pretty good, too, you know?
[30:59.950 --> 31:10.350]  Yeah, I need to try. I'll try Tuesday. I'll see what that's like. I want to see what the least sloppy of the Sloppy Joes, how that plays, how that feels.
[31:10.830 --> 31:19.830]  It's a whole different vibe if you try to play in the daytime for sure. I've been thinking about actually trying to come up with daytime slops and make a whole different board for it because it's like a whole different animal.
[31:21.930 --> 31:22.730]  Clean Joes.
[31:28.970 --> 31:36.570]  Hey, everyone, we wanted to take a moment to remind you that RTX 2023 is happening this July 7th through July 9th.
[31:36.930 --> 31:43.310]  RTX is our favorite time of the year where we get to interact with all the amazing people that give us the opportunity to make content.
[31:43.750 --> 31:50.390]  It's a celebration of all things Rooster Teeth with panels, special guests, community artists, cosplay, and more.
[31:50.890 --> 31:56.630]  There will be exclusive reveals, meet and greets with Rooster Teeth talent, and special merch available only during the event.
[31:57.270 --> 32:00.230]  We're changing up how the convention feels this year and it's going to be awesome.
[32:00.670 --> 32:09.390]  Imagine a mini Epcot-style convention show floor with different attractions and activations from your favorite Rooster Teeth brands, all wrapped up in a summer camp theme.
[32:09.830 --> 32:22.510]  It's the summer camp for indoor kids with Face Jam's Rat & Grackle Pub, a Red Web Escape Room, a F*** Face Museum, Achievement Hunter Mini Golf, and even more cool stuff to do that we're saving for the attendees to experience.
[32:23.050 --> 32:36.910]  I am so excited for the F*** Face Museum. It kills me that I'm not going to be able to make the event this year, but everything I've heard, it sounds so cool, and there's some other things that aren't in this that I know are going to be amazing. It's going to be such a fun event.
[32:37.590 --> 32:48.070]  Thank you so much for listening. We're looking forward to meeting all of you there. Head on over to www.rtxaustin.com to get more information about the event, and buy your badge!
[32:50.450 --> 32:52.830]  I inadvertently discovered a hack yesterday.
[32:55.390 --> 33:01.910]  I think this is more akin to Andrew's original hack of the McDonald's thing.
[33:02.450 --> 33:03.290]  Which means I'll approve.
[33:03.610 --> 33:09.690]  And this is not something I did, but I had the option to try and do. But I really wanted to go home.
[33:09.690 --> 33:16.090]  I went to Alabama, and I was flying back. My ticket for return was like 600 bucks, probably.
[33:17.010 --> 33:28.250]  And then the event I was at, I realized I could finish much earlier than my flight. So I just went to the airport like four hours early, and I tried to switch to an earlier flight.
[33:28.510 --> 33:36.570]  And I could stand by, but I just kind of wanted it guaranteed because I had a connecting flight, which I was already confirmed on. So I was like, I want to just make sure I get that connecting flight.
[33:36.570 --> 33:45.550]  So the difference between fares of this earlier flight was $85, and I thought, that's probably worth it. I'm just going to do that.
[33:46.010 --> 33:48.970]  Guaranteed a spot on the earlier flight. I'm leaving four hours earlier.
[33:49.150 --> 33:56.530]  As soon as I was confirmed on that flight, I opened my app to make sure I would update, and I got this message.
[33:57.630 --> 34:03.610]  Switch flights get a travel credit. We're looking for volunteers to move flights if needed. You're still on your original flight until you offer...
[34:03.610 --> 34:12.850]  So I thought, what if, look at the top option, $825. Now I doubt they would have offered that high because someone would have already picked $400.
[34:13.590 --> 34:31.110]  But imagine if you deliberately switch to an earlier busy flight and then get paid $825 to go back to your original flight. That's more than the entire ticket. That would be like someone paying me to go to Alabama and back.
[34:31.110 --> 34:39.350]  I don't know why you didn't do that. I think that's perfectly legitimate to do. And I think that's just being a smart flyer.
[34:39.390 --> 34:46.850]  But it also brings up something that I've been wanting to talk to you guys for a while about. I also flew this weekend, and I've been seeing this pop up every time I fly.
[34:47.090 --> 34:54.210]  And I'm sure it's the same with you. Here it is. You're showing it right here, Gav. Every time you fly, they ask you if you want to take a later flight for a credit, right?
[34:54.210 --> 34:56.090]  Yeah, because every flight is overbooked.
[34:56.190 --> 35:07.750]  Because every flight is overbooked. If you didn't have a lot going on, wouldn't it be fun to buy a ticket? Not really caring if you went anywhere. And just see how long you can stay at the airport.
[35:08.370 --> 35:09.590]  Just keep deferring.
[35:09.790 --> 35:19.230]  Because eventually, if you defer past 8pm, they'll be like, well, the deferment comes with a hotel room now. And then you can just go to the Holiday Inn Express or whatever, get up the next morning, go back to the airport.
[35:19.550 --> 35:28.190]  You could probably become a millionaire in credit in four days. Just sitting at the airport, just going, I'll do it. I'll do it.
[35:28.830 --> 35:36.050]  What do you do for a living? Oh, I fly for American Airlines. Are you a pilot? No, I just fly on the airline and never go anywhere.
[35:36.050 --> 35:42.990]  I don't even fly, I defer. I just literally just stand in the airport. Imagine deferring for a living.
[35:43.370 --> 35:54.450]  That's great. It's like combining the terminal with the big short. You've found the crack in the system and you're shorting the airlines by just deferring constantly. Never going anywhere.
[35:54.570 --> 36:05.610]  I would always deliberately book onto a very busy flight, the busiest of the day, intending to go much later. Don't even bother going to the airport. Check in, take the offer, and then just show up much later.
[36:06.050 --> 36:17.430]  And you could save so much money. Yeah, you might miss your flight. I thought about it on Sunday because when you were in Alabama, I was in Savannah, Georgia over the weekend.
[36:17.770 --> 36:24.150]  And I was there with Emily and Millie and it was like $250 a ticket to delay my flight from Savannah to Charlotte.
[36:24.770 --> 36:34.330]  And it's Sunday and you just had a whole weekend and you're tired. But I was thinking about, man, there's real power if you fly with people and you bought all the tickets. That was $750 right there.
[36:34.330 --> 36:44.370]  Yeah, I've never seen it that high. I've seen it for $100 and stuff. And then you just have to weigh up like how valuable is my time? And I really thought about doing it, but I'd already confirmed myself on this connecting flight.
[36:44.590 --> 36:52.630]  I've seen them go $1,000 before. That's insane. That's gotta be more than the flights. Oh, easily. Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[36:52.630 --> 37:05.230]  But at that point, it's not, I mean, their profit margin is probably so good. They're just, they're more worried about efficiency, you know, and dealing with like, dealing with, they're already gouging the eyeballs out of us on money anyway.
[37:05.430 --> 37:15.210]  So they're probably more just concerned with volume and not having too much, too many people miserable and queuing up.
[37:16.290 --> 37:18.430]  So Andrew, what do you think? Valid hack?
[37:19.350 --> 37:27.950]  Oh, absolutely. Yeah, that's a fantastic hack. I love the idea of spending like the whole day in an airport, just deferring to try to see how much you can get. It's a great premise.
[37:28.070 --> 37:33.550]  It'd be a great contest, right? See who could do it the longest. Like, could you make it a week and not ever actually get on your flight?
[37:33.810 --> 37:42.870]  That feels like too long. I'm trying to think of the best place to do it. I feel like the Dallas to Austin from Dallas. Well, I guess where else would it be from? It's always so busy.
[37:42.870 --> 37:49.490]  But there's a lot of flights, so it kind of depends on the day. But I always feel like there's 18 people on standby for those flights.
[37:49.810 --> 37:58.030]  Just go from hub to hub, like Dallas to Chicago or Chicago to Charlotte. And just, I bet you just sit there and churn.
[37:59.830 --> 38:03.190]  How'd you make your first million? Well, let me tell you. Let me tell you about DFW.
[38:04.830 --> 38:07.890]  I like the idea of having a million in credit for the thing you didn't do.
[38:09.050 --> 38:11.350]  What's your bank? Oh, the American Airlines app.
[38:14.730 --> 38:16.210]  I'll pay you in flights.
[38:18.430 --> 38:27.110]  Listen, I'm a little... I'm like, all right, I finished your roof. I'm a little short on cash right now, but let me offer you this. Where would you like to fly in the continent of the United States? I've got you covered.
[38:27.870 --> 38:30.090]  I'm a millionaire, but it expires in 2025.
[38:30.570 --> 38:41.510]  I'm getting dragged out of a restaurant, trying to like argue that like, no, this grilled cheese is... you're telling me this grilled cheese is not worth a flight to Greece? This grilled cheese is not worth a flight to Greece. These people are crazy.
[38:44.490 --> 38:48.510]  Gav, I think that's the best hack you've had so far. Yeah, it's great.
[38:48.890 --> 38:58.030]  If I have something that's not time sensitive, I'm definitely going to try it. I'm going to deliberately change to an earlier fuller flight and then try and get credit back to my original flight.
[39:00.130 --> 39:14.630]  That's fantastic. Yeah, you absolutely should. You need to explore this further. I had a really... this is a small thing, but it made me happy. I was playing the new Sherlock Holmes game, which came out.
[39:14.770 --> 39:25.570]  Oh, how is it? Oh, it's great. It's like not the best one because they're a Ukraine studio, so it's difficult times to like try to release a game. It's a remaster of an old one.
[39:25.570 --> 39:33.570]  What kind of game is it? It's like a mystery type game, but it's always like you have to investigate, and it's fun because typically you can accuse the wrong person.
[39:33.950 --> 39:43.790]  Like you can gather all the evidence, and there's typically like three choices. Is it like third person? Yeah, it's third person. It's a third person, like walk around, scan for clues.
[39:44.070 --> 39:50.490]  Oh, so it's one of those ones where you just put a fucking magnifying glass over everything in a room until you find the right thing.
[39:50.490 --> 39:57.950]  It's more like Batman, you know, in the Arkham games where like you hit right bumper and you got Sherlock vision and like you could scan stuff and like walk around.
[39:58.150 --> 40:10.410]  I was playing the new one, and this was last week, and I had such a wonderful time playing the game, but then there was a surprise in it that made me laugh harder than it would have in other contexts.
[40:10.490 --> 40:14.350]  I'm going to post a screenshot. This is a letter in the game. I'll read part of it very quickly.
[40:14.350 --> 40:22.170]  Love letter from Arneson. I can't wait to hold your hand and be lost in your beautiful eyes completely and forever yours, Errol.
[40:22.410 --> 40:36.010]  There's a character named Errol, and every time they brought up Errol, I lost it. That guy sounds cheeky. He's a little cheeky. He lost some fingers and got dragged out of his house. He's a little cheeky.
[40:37.970 --> 40:44.690]  I don't have like a ridiculous story with this, but this was like two days after we recorded that episode.
[40:44.910 --> 40:47.070]  Wow, how often do you come across the name Errol?
[40:47.370 --> 40:53.630]  Almost never. So to see it pop up was a great time. It was fantastic.
[40:54.190 --> 40:57.590]  It's always nice to have an Errol sighting. I bet you see it more often now that we've had the conversation.
[40:58.070 --> 40:58.850]  I hope so.
[40:59.170 --> 41:02.570]  It's like if you talk about a Mustang, suddenly every time you drive you see like four Mustangs.
[41:02.570 --> 41:06.410]  Totally. Yeah, absolutely. I'd love more Errols in my life though.
[41:06.690 --> 41:13.030]  Hey, y'all know how I did that? I had that XFL opportunity and I got to go run out on the field.
[41:13.430 --> 41:16.790]  I had another cool sports thing happen to me over the weekend.
[41:17.010 --> 41:17.710]  What happened?
[41:18.130 --> 41:27.030]  Well, you know, we went to Savannah to do a college tour. And by the way, I've never been to Savannah before. Phenomenal city. Everybody there was so genuinely nice.
[41:27.130 --> 41:31.630]  I actually have a really weird thing I want to talk to you guys about that happened and I think it'll spark a conversation.
[41:32.570 --> 41:35.870]  I actually got a bunch of stuff I want to talk about. We won't get to it today, but we might get to that one.
[41:37.230 --> 41:42.790]  Anyway, just like a gorgeous, it's like like New Orleans without the puke. It was awesome.
[41:45.150 --> 41:52.230]  And while I was there, I went to a Savannah Bananas game who is, you know, the baseball team that created a banana ball that we're well, I'm a fan of.
[41:52.310 --> 41:56.410]  I think I think y'all. Yeah, maybe they're great. Is it hard to get tickets to that?
[41:56.890 --> 41:59.650]  Yeah, dude. This is how hard it is to get tickets. I had to buy them on StubHub.
[41:59.650 --> 42:09.990]  I bought general admission was all I could get. It was two hundred dollars per ticket, so I paid six hundred bucks for Millie, Emily and I to go to this game.
[42:10.170 --> 42:15.750]  I got the tickets. They're twenty five dollar tickets. That was how much the price was to get it.
[42:15.790 --> 42:20.550]  But it was like I've been a fan for a while now. I've been kind of obsessed with them.
[42:20.930 --> 42:23.510]  Who knows if and when I'm ever going back to Savannah?
[42:23.890 --> 42:26.510]  You know, I don't know that Millie's going to want to go to Savannah for college.
[42:26.510 --> 42:27.930]  And if she does, I don't know that she'll get accepted.
[42:27.930 --> 42:31.870]  Like there's a lot that has to happen for Savannah to become a place that I visit again.
[42:32.030 --> 42:34.890]  And so I was like, this is my opportunity. They're playing a home game.
[42:35.030 --> 42:38.810]  They've been on tour all year. So it's like I really wanted to go and see it.
[42:38.970 --> 42:43.650]  And so I was like, fuck it. This is one of those moments where you spend a little bit extra money for the experience.
[42:44.090 --> 42:48.490]  And I wouldn't do it again at that price, but it was totally it was one of the best sports experiences I've ever had.
[42:48.990 --> 42:50.890]  And I took a bunch of videos. I don't think I sent them to y'all.
[42:50.890 --> 42:59.250]  I think I just sent them to Eric and Jack, but I've got some funny some funny videos of like dudes on stilts playing baseball and stuff I can send you guys.
[43:01.470 --> 43:04.530]  But as a matter of fact, I should post upload some of those to you.
[43:04.710 --> 43:09.170]  But anyway, after the game, I just posted a picture of it saying that I was there.
[43:09.230 --> 43:17.850]  And then after the game, I got a fucking Instagram message from the producer, their broadcast producer, who was like, hey, we saw you at the game.
[43:17.850 --> 43:22.650]  If you ever ever back at a Savannah Bananas game and want to sit in on a broadcast of this, let us know.
[43:22.690 --> 43:27.450]  So now I got to go back so that I can sit in and broadcast on a fucking bananas game.
[43:27.510 --> 43:32.350]  Like, how cool is that? That's incredible. You're a straight up sports influencer, dude.
[43:32.490 --> 43:39.270]  I'm carving out a weird little niche and I am pretty fucking excited about it.
[43:39.330 --> 43:43.350]  Let me tell you, I am not. That's unbelievable.
[43:43.350 --> 43:56.910]  That's so funny. I texted Geoff a thing related to like sport, like being announced in a sports thing under the thing of like, well, whenever this will fucking happen again, like there's no there's no possibility of this being in the near future.
[43:57.050 --> 44:01.290]  But if it did, that's wild. So when are you going to do it? You have to do this.
[44:01.910 --> 44:06.830]  I don't know. Like whenever I have occasion to go back to Savannah, I guess. But I really, really want.
[44:06.910 --> 44:09.950]  That's not the occasion. You're not just going to go to Savannah for this.
[44:09.950 --> 44:11.450]  Oh, just for that. Yeah.
[44:14.170 --> 44:19.570]  Yeah. Let me tell you, I would say I would consider it. Sure. Let me sell you on this. You go there early in the morning.
[44:19.650 --> 44:24.630]  OK, you defer like four flights. It's free. It's a free trip. You're set.
[44:26.170 --> 44:30.810]  I love this. You and stilt guy. Oh, yeah. I take a photo with Millie and I with the stilt guy.
[44:30.910 --> 44:34.690]  And then the dude who does all the fucking dancing. I have a funny video of him, actually.
[44:34.790 --> 44:39.430]  The dude on the left. Let me see if I can post this to you guys or if it's going to be too fucking dumb ass powerful.
[44:40.690 --> 44:44.510]  Oh, we got upgraded. It's all right. File sizes are bigger now.
[44:45.070 --> 44:50.290]  Let me see. I can't believe Eric won. He did. He beat. Yeah, he did. He waited him out.
[44:51.650 --> 44:57.850]  There you go. This is a video sense of what what the game is like.
[45:01.210 --> 45:05.230]  This guy dancing on the field. Is he being a fish? Yeah, he's doing that.
[45:05.390 --> 45:07.750]  I don't know if you can hear it, but it's the SpongeBob SquarePants song.
[45:07.750 --> 45:13.130]  So he's being a fish while it's on. And then then he starts doing other shit.
[45:13.770 --> 45:18.810]  It's great. It's just like, well, he's got some moves. Oh, dude, they're phenomenal.
[45:18.990 --> 45:22.750]  It's the most insane thing I've ever experienced. Like it is.
[45:23.050 --> 45:25.930]  I got a video of the stilt guy pitching. Let me send that to you.
[45:27.330 --> 45:32.510]  Oh, here's the fucking banana in the outfield. He spent two innings just sitting there in that chair.
[45:34.750 --> 45:37.050]  Pretty, pretty heavy Eric energy on that guy.
[45:38.690 --> 45:43.050]  He's baseball adjacent. Yeah. Yeah, that's me. I'm hanging out.
[45:43.590 --> 45:47.450]  Is there a thing where like if you hit the banana, it counts as like a Grand Slam or something?
[45:47.650 --> 45:53.030]  Is there a side rule? I don't know. It didn't happen. I don't think so, man.
[45:53.650 --> 45:56.770]  I mean, I don't want that guy to get hit, but it would be really funny if that guy got hit.
[45:56.770 --> 46:05.410]  Their product is so goddamn fun. I've never experienced a sporting event like it.
[46:05.630 --> 46:10.990]  You talk about like Sloppy Joe, so there's too much to look at. There's so much going on at all times.
[46:11.410 --> 46:17.370]  And it's kind of like, it's just impressive. So throughout the whole game, they're playing.
[46:17.450 --> 46:24.510]  They do this brilliant thing where they play like the hook, like the good 15 seconds of every song you've ever heard.
[46:24.510 --> 46:29.330]  And they have bits for each one. So like when it's raining men comes on or some other song comes on,
[46:29.650 --> 46:35.530]  suddenly everybody breaks into a rehearsed action. And so you never know what it's going to be because you don't know what they've rehearsed.
[46:35.710 --> 46:41.930]  So like there was one point where we're like in the fifth inning and suddenly a song came on and the umpire started twerking.
[46:42.270 --> 46:48.450]  And I just hadn't considered that the umpire would at any point be a part of the show. It was fucking wild.
[46:48.450 --> 46:51.130]  I can't say no. I won't bore the audience.
[46:51.390 --> 46:53.710]  Does the stilt guy bat?
[46:54.550 --> 46:56.130]  Nah, he only pitches, I think.
[46:56.870 --> 46:59.090]  I was wondering, where would the little rectangle be?
[46:59.610 --> 47:06.850]  They only brought him in for like one inning to pitch, I think.
[47:08.170 --> 47:09.370]  Yeah, it's just ludicrous.
[47:10.750 --> 47:17.090]  Really cool and I'm really digging this like weird all like sports influencing thing we've got going on.
[47:18.710 --> 47:26.950]  If you want me to run your team out or speak enthusiastically about them on a broadcast, just let Eric know. I'll be there.
[47:29.790 --> 47:32.250]  Oh, can I talk to you guys about a weird thing that happened to me while I was there?
[47:32.790 --> 47:33.430]  Yeah, of course.
[47:35.830 --> 47:37.570]  What is the...
[47:37.570 --> 47:39.910]  Alright, I'll explain what happened and then I'm going to ask you guys a question.
[47:40.490 --> 47:40.810]  Okay.
[47:42.050 --> 47:44.010]  We were on a college tour, right?
[47:44.510 --> 47:48.850]  My kids are looking at college in Savannah. So we're on this tour. We're touring like the film school.
[47:49.570 --> 47:52.410]  And then we're about to move on to like the photography school.
[47:52.690 --> 47:56.450]  And we were all just kind of like beat for a minute. Like we just needed a break.
[47:56.710 --> 47:58.050]  We'd been going for a couple hours.
[47:58.650 --> 48:03.450]  And so we're on campus and we're like, let's take a break.
[48:04.150 --> 48:06.790]  It's like a self-guided tour so you can come and go as you please.
[48:07.110 --> 48:12.490]  Like, let's take a break. Let's go get some coffee or a soda or something and chill out in the air conditioning for a minute and relax.
[48:13.090 --> 48:16.330]  Catch our breath. Check up on our phones or whatever and then get back to it.
[48:16.390 --> 48:17.390]  We all just kind of needed a minute.
[48:17.890 --> 48:21.310]  And so I googled, I google mapped a coffee shop.
[48:22.190 --> 48:24.470]  And one thing about Savannah that I do not like.
[48:24.570 --> 48:28.510]  Every time I google mapped anywhere and then we walked to where it said it was, it was not there.
[48:29.090 --> 48:34.070]  It happened to like two restaurants I tried to go to and then I google mapped a coffee shop, a Starbucks.
[48:34.670 --> 48:39.470]  And we're like, oh okay, there's a Starbucks in this hotel. Let's just go there. It's within, it's a five minute walk.
[48:39.870 --> 48:43.170]  And we go to this area and there's no fucking Starbucks there.
[48:43.710 --> 48:45.170]  Again, it's like the third time this has happened to me.
[48:45.530 --> 48:53.130]  And so we look around and we see a coffee shop, like an independent coffee shop, within walking distance to kind of down the road.
[48:53.250 --> 48:55.990]  And we're like, I guess, I mean, whatever. We just want to sit down.
[48:56.170 --> 48:58.130]  So we go that way and we go to this coffee shop.
[48:58.350 --> 49:01.930]  The only reason we're in this coffee shop is because we needed a break from a tour.
[49:02.570 --> 49:07.310]  Let me rephrase that. The only reason we're in a coffee shop is because we needed a break from the tour.
[49:07.310 --> 49:12.470]  The only reason we're in this coffee shop is because the Starbucks didn't exist.
[49:13.030 --> 49:14.190]  That they tried to take me to.
[49:15.310 --> 49:20.690]  Sit down, I pick up, we order drinks, I get an iced coffee, I sit down, we're all just kind of doing our own thing.
[49:20.810 --> 49:23.410]  I'm on my phone, just like catching up on the news or whatever.
[49:24.270 --> 49:27.010]  And Millie goes, is that Elise Willems?
[49:27.750 --> 49:30.050]  And I go, I don't even look at my phone, I go, absolutely not.
[49:30.850 --> 49:33.350]  And Millie goes, I think it might be Elise.
[49:33.630 --> 49:34.490]  And I go, impossible.
[49:34.830 --> 49:36.610]  And she goes, no, I'm pretty sure it's Elise.
[49:37.490 --> 49:39.430]  I refuse to look at my phone for this.
[49:39.550 --> 49:43.610]  I'm in my zone, I'm taking my Geoff break, I need my time.
[49:44.090 --> 49:49.990]  And I just go, listen, there's absolutely no reason Elise Willems would be in Savannah, Georgia right now.
[49:50.270 --> 49:54.630]  They're in California, we're here, it's impossible that Elise Williams would be here.
[49:54.690 --> 49:58.610]  And I hear, Geoff? And I look up, and it's goddamn Elise Williams from Funhaus.
[49:59.030 --> 50:01.250]  In the same coffee shop as I am.
[50:01.530 --> 50:01.790]  Willems.
[50:02.990 --> 50:04.570]  Did I say Williams? I said Willems.
[50:04.570 --> 50:06.930]  Yeah, you kept going more and more Williams.
[50:07.130 --> 50:08.170]  Did I say Williams?
[50:08.450 --> 50:10.930]  You were slowly transitioning into Williams.
[50:11.170 --> 50:12.370]  Willems, Williams, Williams.
[50:13.710 --> 50:16.330]  I just get, I don't know, I get twangy when I get emphatic.
[50:16.730 --> 50:23.730]  Goddamn Elise Willems is there, all the way from California, Funhaus, in the same fucking coffee shop that we are.
[50:23.910 --> 50:28.230]  And I just think about, and we had like a nice little catch up, they were in town for a vacation or whatever.
[50:28.650 --> 50:32.490]  They just happen to be, that's too small a world.
[50:32.870 --> 50:33.630]  It's too small a world.
[50:34.570 --> 50:35.930]  Did they not find their non-existent Starbucks?
[50:36.610 --> 50:40.790]  No, no, they knew, and it was just Elise, James wasn't there at the moment, it was just Elise.
[50:41.110 --> 50:42.570]  He was like with his family or something.
[50:43.630 --> 50:57.290]  And so, yeah, like what are the odds that we would be in the same city at the same time, and then that like confluence of events had to happen in the way that it happened for us to be in the same coffee shop at the same time.
[50:57.470 --> 51:01.830]  Like a two minute variance in any direction, that meeting never happens.
[51:02.030 --> 51:03.710]  How often does that happen, do you think?
[51:04.570 --> 51:05.490]  That's what I was going to ask you guys.
[51:05.510 --> 51:10.650]  Somewhere thousands of miles away, and you have like quite a close friend, and then you just miss them, and you don't even know.
[51:11.010 --> 51:13.430]  Right, like how often does it come very, very close?
[51:13.550 --> 51:22.930]  Like how many times in your life have you been like 30 seconds away from running into Dan or Bernie or like Yo Mary Cruz or somebody you know from childhood?
[51:23.790 --> 51:29.410]  You know, or just like somebody you know in our past, you know, like Nico or whoever.
[51:29.910 --> 51:34.150]  And you were just like, you're just like strangers in the night, you just miss each other, and you were so close to connecting.
[51:34.790 --> 51:35.830]  Like it must happen.
[51:36.010 --> 51:37.210]  I can't believe that.
[51:37.390 --> 51:38.090]  It must happen a lot, right?
[51:38.230 --> 51:40.350]  Was it too weird to have a normal conversation?
[51:42.510 --> 51:46.230]  Well, we hadn't seen each other, I don't think, since the pandemic, so it was a nice little catch up.
[51:46.490 --> 51:51.970]  But I think we were both, it was weird for a second, because I think we were both so surprised to see each other.
[51:52.310 --> 51:59.930]  And so like, this doesn't make sense. You're not in this place. Why are you in this place? You know, you get a little distrustful.
[52:00.870 --> 52:07.350]  But I love James and Elyse. I think they're two of the funniest people I've ever met, and I absolutely adore working with them.
[52:07.590 --> 52:10.890]  I can't imagine a better person to bump into than Elyse.
[52:10.910 --> 52:18.390]  Yeah, Elyse is literally one of my favorite people to perform with. Like we did Last Laugh together, and I laughed so fucking hard getting to work with her.
[52:18.390 --> 52:25.750]  And so just getting to see them, or I guess just her in this instance, in that environment, it was awesome, and it was funny.
[52:26.370 --> 52:35.050]  And I'm sure she's telling this story somewhere in Funhaus right now. But yeah, like how fucking crazy is it that that happened?
[52:35.610 --> 52:37.250]  She's talking about how she saw Geoff Rimsey.
[52:37.750 --> 52:38.310]  Geoff Rimsey?
[52:39.970 --> 52:40.830]  You didn't see him?
[52:40.830 --> 52:42.110]  Like how? James wasn't there?
[52:42.670 --> 52:47.790]  He was like trying to meet up with his parents or something. Like they were trying to coordinate some Ubers or some shit.
[52:48.450 --> 52:51.450]  I said hi to him. I talked to him on the phone. I said hi to him on the phone, and then we texted.
[52:52.850 --> 52:55.130]  You were in the same city, but you said hi to him on the phone.
[52:56.510 --> 52:58.170]  You could do that right now if you wanted to.
[52:58.390 --> 53:02.130]  No, I know. I think he was also equally shocked, but we had to get back to a tour and stuff too.
[53:02.230 --> 53:04.630]  It's like they were going somewhere, and we were on our way back.
[53:05.530 --> 53:12.710]  Like we were there for Millie and her thing, so I'm not trying to like crowbar in a dinner or something when they're on a family vacation with their family and shit.
[53:12.710 --> 53:15.450]  But it was just awesome. It was just awesome to run into them.
[53:16.070 --> 53:20.390]  And it just got me thinking like how many times has this almost happened to you in your life?
[53:20.690 --> 53:25.530]  Yeah, I can think of a time when I was in the office. I've talked about this.
[53:25.950 --> 53:30.170]  And Gavin walked by without noticing me and then walked out without noticing me.
[53:30.310 --> 53:34.010]  Alright, once again, it's not that I didn't notice you. I didn't know what you looked like.
[53:34.290 --> 53:40.870]  No, no, you did. No, that's not true. That was after that. That was way beyond that. We went to Pinballs at this point.
[53:40.870 --> 53:46.550]  That was before Pinballs. No, it wasn't. It was after. It was post-Pinballs. This is a post-Pinballs.
[53:47.070 --> 53:53.730]  So I just like went through the office. You just went through the office and didn't see me? Well, I just stared at you the entire time.
[53:54.150 --> 53:56.810]  Well, you could say hello. I'm probably going somewhere.
[53:57.490 --> 54:02.290]  Yeah, I didn't know if you had like an important thing that was going on. Like I wasn't going to interrupt you in any way.
[54:02.370 --> 54:07.430]  But I was just like, oh, certainly he will like notice me and wave and say like hello.
[54:07.530 --> 54:10.330]  But no, you just walked in and out. No concept that I was there.
[54:10.870 --> 54:11.810]  Did I see you later on that trip?
[54:12.430 --> 54:19.510]  Uh, I don't know if you did. Oh, come on. I don't remember that. That's the main thing I remember about that experience.
[54:19.630 --> 54:22.050]  I feel like every time you've been in the office, I've been there.
[54:22.730 --> 54:28.710]  I don't know. Why was I? I don't remember why I was there. We must have. I mean, yeah, there must have been something.
[54:29.050 --> 54:32.430]  But I don't remember what I was specifically there for at that time.
[54:32.930 --> 54:41.750]  Speaking of Nico, he sent me a nice piece of mail. Then I started texting him. I had a really nice long conversation with Nico on text. He really likes Andrew Panton.
[54:42.850 --> 54:43.550]  Oh, yeah. I love Nico.
[54:45.090 --> 54:50.790]  I wouldn't have met any of you if it wasn't for Nico. And my introduction through this was through Nico.
[54:51.130 --> 54:57.150]  Yeah, we would like to talk about what we do, what we're mainly focused on now. And I was like, yeah, a podcast called F*** Face.
[54:59.050 --> 55:00.450]  I was telling him all about it.
[55:01.010 --> 55:07.770]  So, Gav, you travel more than any of us. You travel all the time. Have you ever run into somebody in an unexpected place like that?
[55:08.450 --> 55:17.350]  I ran into Tom, who used to take a lot of the store pictures and did graphic design.
[55:17.510 --> 55:18.450]  He was an artist, yeah.
[55:18.670 --> 55:25.250]  Yeah, a very talented artist. I bumped into him in a line for coffee at the Reykjavik airport.
[55:25.610 --> 55:29.510]  Are you serious? That's so far. That's so random.
[55:30.450 --> 55:31.410]  What was he doing in Reykjavik?
[55:31.850 --> 55:38.810]  I have no idea, but I couldn't... The coffee that was in my mouth almost fell out because I couldn't believe...
[55:38.810 --> 55:50.270]  It was like I saw him and I was used to seeing him around, but I had to remember where I was. I was like, what's going on? Wait, what's happened? Why is the simulation breaking?
[55:50.690 --> 55:54.410]  Yeah, it's like, why does... I guess they have their own Tom. That's weird.
[55:56.630 --> 55:57.950]  It's not the same guy.
[55:58.650 --> 55:59.670]  There's Icelandic Tom.
[56:00.130 --> 56:05.550]  Yeah, and it might have been the first time we had just a conversation that wasn't about work.
[56:06.450 --> 56:07.430]  That's funny. Wow.
[56:08.530 --> 56:10.310]  How's he doing? We haven't seen him in years.
[56:10.810 --> 56:12.710]  Well, that was five years ago, so I'm not sure.
[56:14.230 --> 56:15.870]  Well, I hope he's doing well. I always liked Tom.
[56:15.870 --> 56:21.910]  I went to lunch with Major League fan Jack recently, and I was telling him about the Willems thing.
[56:22.390 --> 56:30.210]  And he was telling me that he was in Scotland one day on vacation with Katie, and they were walking down the street.
[56:30.510 --> 56:34.330]  And they looked up, and Adam Ellis was just walking right in front of them, like walking right towards them.
[56:34.370 --> 56:36.430]  Oh, wow. Crazy.
[56:37.010 --> 56:40.630]  This is inside baseball for a f*** face audience, but Adam Ellis is another guy who used to work at Rooster Teeth.
[56:41.050 --> 56:42.370]  Like three or four years ago, he said.
[56:42.590 --> 56:42.990]  Wow.
[56:44.530 --> 56:52.870]  I guess it's one of those things where it's like, when you have a slightly larger company, the chances of two people having the same birthday goes up exponentially somehow.
[56:53.050 --> 56:58.470]  And it must be the same thing, where it's like, if you have a couple hundred employees, you're going to see them in other places.
[56:58.990 --> 57:02.170]  But I just don't know how, because there's eight billion people.
[57:02.590 --> 57:08.750]  Well, it doesn't have to just be co-workers, too. It's like the accumulation of every person you've ever met or become friendly with in your life, too.
[57:09.710 --> 57:11.850]  All three of our examples were co-workers, though.
[57:11.850 --> 57:18.410]  That is true. And I was about to say, the day job is big enough that there are two G. Geoffs in the company.
[57:19.530 --> 57:24.510]  That's f***ing big. I've never in my life been around another G. Geoff. Ever.
[57:25.610 --> 57:28.150]  There were two Gavins at one point.
[57:28.210 --> 57:28.910]  Yeah, that's right.
[57:29.990 --> 57:31.670]  I feel like that's a little less rare, but yeah.
[57:32.230 --> 57:34.790]  I got a ton of emails that were supposed to be for him.
[57:35.130 --> 57:40.590]  Oh, I still get it. I still get it. I get alumni emails for the other Geoffs constantly.
[57:40.590 --> 57:42.130]  I just forward them to him all the time.
[57:43.330 --> 57:44.390]  For his college.
[57:45.450 --> 57:49.130]  So when you went through Facebook recently, Gavin, any updates for Tom? You reach out there?
[57:49.610 --> 57:51.890]  Are there any messages waiting for you that you may have not seen?
[57:52.390 --> 57:54.970]  Well, let me check. I actually haven't looked.
[57:57.870 --> 57:58.870]  Alex pissed off?
[57:59.330 --> 58:00.190]  Yeah, we should end this.
[58:00.470 --> 58:02.470]  Nope, not pissed off. Doing good.
[58:03.130 --> 58:07.090]  Just trying to get it to a wrapping point, because we have another one to do.
[58:07.350 --> 58:08.810]  Should stop wrapping up.
[58:10.170 --> 58:13.350]  Wrap up. No. Stop. End this. I'd say you're pretty pissed.
[58:13.650 --> 58:18.430]  No, I don't think so. We've heard annoyed Eric. This is like, he's standard Eric.
[58:18.850 --> 58:19.930]  Pre-mad is regular Eric.
[58:20.190 --> 58:22.290]  He'll get mad real quick if we don't end it though.
[58:22.590 --> 58:23.650]  I'm not pre-mad yet. This is fine.
[58:23.670 --> 58:24.870]  I thought you were always pre-mad.
[58:25.150 --> 58:28.050]  No, no, no. I'm not quite always pre-mad.
[58:29.150 --> 58:32.850]  Just, you know, just kind of ready to go. You know what I mean?
[58:32.970 --> 58:38.070]  You know how you're supposed to warm up a car's engine before you really drive it on a cold day?
[58:38.810 --> 58:43.730]  For sure. I'm an engine in just like a tepid climate, so I'm really ready to go at this point.
[58:44.410 --> 58:46.350]  Oh, I do have a message on Facebook.
[58:46.530 --> 58:48.370]  No way! Come on!
[58:48.870 --> 58:49.110]  Wow!
[58:50.030 --> 58:51.690]  Okay, what is it? What is it?
[58:52.030 --> 58:53.090]  Oh, I'm gonna post a screenshot.
[58:53.670 --> 58:55.870]  Heard the fucking episode, fucker!
[59:00.070 --> 59:01.970]  What? Hang on.
[59:01.970 --> 59:04.610]  I forgot I did that. I forgot I did that.
[59:06.870 --> 59:11.630]  I think I did that the day we recorded. I was like, I wonder how long it'll take for him to see this.
[59:15.130 --> 59:16.710]  That's great. That's awesome.
[59:18.550 --> 59:19.430]  Oh, man.
[59:19.550 --> 59:20.290]  Love it.
[59:21.190 --> 59:22.790]  What a great place to end it on.
[59:23.510 --> 59:29.410]  Hey, check it out, dickhead. You listened to a whole other episode of the F*** Face Podcast. Thanks for doing that. We really appreciate it.
[59:29.410 --> 59:36.390]  Speaking of appreciating it, we would be extra appreciative if you would spread the word about the F*** Face Podcast.
[59:36.910 --> 59:43.410]  Because the truth dies in the darkness, as they say. And if we do anything in F*** Face, we spread truth and light.
[59:43.730 --> 59:49.790]  So tell everybody about it. Give us stars. All the stars in the sky for F*** Face.
[59:50.850 --> 59:51.690]  Thanks for listening.
[59:52.070 --> 59:55.030]  Destiny? Truth and light? What are we? What?
[59:55.030 --> 01:00:02.190]  Oh, if you're listening to this and you're wondering what the message was that Gavin got on Facebook, it was from Andrew Panton.
[01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:05.770]  And it says, want to make plans in 10 years. Thanks for listening. Bye.
[01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:07.450]  We have YouTube.
[01:00:12.010 --> 01:00:17.470]  Hey, guys. Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:21.290]  What's the best car? TPG Talk returns to the podcast.
[01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:25.210]  Gavin is so British. Does having to pee make you funnier?
[01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:28.850]  The gang discusses Kafka. The episode ends with a bang.
[01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:31.410]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:34.730]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
