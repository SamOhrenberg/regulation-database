[00:00.000 --> 00:01.240]  You ever wonder why we're here?
[00:06.180 --> 00:08.000]  It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?
[00:19.220 --> 00:25.180]  If you're gonna say that you're engine, Geoff, what type of car would your engine be? The rhythm of?
[00:25.940 --> 00:31.540]  What car are you? And would I find you in your yard if I dug deep enough? How far would I have to...
[00:31.540 --> 00:33.840]  That's a heavy question to ask somebody.
[00:34.000 --> 00:35.080]  What type of engine are they?
[00:35.240 --> 00:36.940]  What kind of car are they?
[00:36.940 --> 00:38.800]  What kind of car... Hold on a second.
[00:39.520 --> 00:41.720]  Hold on a second. Hello and welcome to another episode of F*** Face.
[00:41.800 --> 00:44.440]  Episode 155. My name is Geoff Ramsay. With me as always, Gavin Free and Andrew Payton.
[00:44.660 --> 00:45.840]  What kind of car are you?
[00:46.080 --> 00:47.100]  I thought this was 154.
[00:47.560 --> 00:49.440]  It is 154. What did I say?
[00:49.620 --> 00:50.220]  I think 5.
[00:51.280 --> 00:53.120]  Hello and welcome to the F*** Face podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsay.
[00:53.320 --> 00:55.900]  With me as always, Gavin Free and Andrew Payton. This is episode 154. Let's go.
[00:56.400 --> 00:57.560]  What kind of car are you?
[00:58.940 --> 01:01.180]  Are you asking the audience or are you asking one of us?
[01:01.300 --> 01:02.000]  I'm asking you!
[01:02.380 --> 01:03.300]  Oh, asking me?
[01:03.300 --> 01:04.760]  I don't know.
[01:05.580 --> 01:07.140]  Is a golf cart a car?
[01:07.360 --> 01:08.320]  A golf cart?
[01:08.760 --> 01:09.740]  Sure, yeah, sure.
[01:09.960 --> 01:11.600]  It's a car and GTA, yeah.
[01:11.800 --> 01:12.820]  I think I'm a golf cart.
[01:13.380 --> 01:13.640]  Okay.
[01:14.720 --> 01:16.740]  And, Eric, what kind of car are you?
[01:17.040 --> 01:20.420]  I am a 1972 Chevy Nova matte black.
[01:20.840 --> 01:21.620]  You wish.
[01:22.440 --> 01:22.960]  That's me.
[01:23.140 --> 01:24.600]  That's a pretty f***ing nice car, dude.
[01:24.920 --> 01:28.780]  If I had all the money in the world, like it was no object, that's the car I would buy.
[01:28.920 --> 01:31.960]  I have a whole thing where if I was like super, super rich,
[01:31.960 --> 01:34.020]  I would buy a hundred of those,
[01:34.200 --> 01:36.920]  and I would drive them off a cliff every day,
[01:37.040 --> 01:38.320]  and jump out,
[01:38.480 --> 01:40.100]  and parachute down to safety,
[01:40.200 --> 01:41.440]  and then have a helicopter pick me up.
[01:41.740 --> 01:43.360]  I have like a whole plan.
[01:43.800 --> 01:45.620]  I have like a whole plan for like what I'd listen to,
[01:45.740 --> 01:46.620]  and like how it would go.
[01:46.960 --> 01:47.620]  That's great.
[01:47.960 --> 01:49.160]  Gavin, what type of car are you?
[01:50.420 --> 01:51.800]  Probably a Reliant Robin.
[01:52.320 --> 01:53.140]  Reliant Robin.
[01:53.440 --> 01:54.380]  Can you send three wheels?
[01:54.640 --> 01:55.460]  What is a Reliant Robin?
[01:55.460 --> 01:57.600]  It's the three wheeled one, right?
[01:57.740 --> 01:59.680]  That always tilts when you turn too fast?
[02:00.000 --> 02:00.920]  Oh, yeah.
[02:01.520 --> 02:02.400]  There we go.
[02:02.700 --> 02:06.360]  I mean, they don't actually roll over.
[02:06.440 --> 02:09.180]  You have to like kind of mess with them to make them do that, but yeah.
[02:09.360 --> 02:12.720]  You're not feeling like you're more of a rugged Robin?
[02:13.120 --> 02:14.300]  I'm like a rugged Robin.
[02:14.600 --> 02:17.000]  It's the military version.
[02:17.660 --> 02:20.600]  If we ever have a f***ing face car, can it be that?
[02:21.080 --> 02:21.920]  That's pretty cool.
[02:21.920 --> 02:23.980]  That's incredible.
[02:24.520 --> 02:25.920]  It's so cool.
[02:26.700 --> 02:31.300]  And the bonus part is that you look so cool in it.
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.800]  Don't you think that could be you?
[02:36.420 --> 02:38.160]  I wish. I don't think I'm cool.
[02:38.300 --> 02:39.320]  That's definitely Gavin.
[02:39.780 --> 02:43.600]  Which personality is that, Gavin?
[02:44.560 --> 02:46.160]  That's definitely Errol's car.
[02:46.500 --> 02:47.180]  That's Errol's car?
[02:47.740 --> 02:51.740]  I would say I get out of the Reliant Robin and Errol gets into the Rugged Robin.
[02:55.500 --> 02:57.020]  And Nick, what kind of car are you?
[02:57.380 --> 02:59.480]  Oh, God, I wish I had something that cool.
[02:59.600 --> 03:03.540]  I have the 1967 Ford Mercury Cougar.
[03:03.560 --> 03:05.160]  That's a nice car, too.
[03:05.280 --> 03:06.480]  That's a classic, baby.
[03:07.520 --> 03:11.900]  What is the car that Charlie Sheen went into when he got killed?
[03:12.160 --> 03:12.800]  When he died?
[03:13.660 --> 03:14.040]  Wait, what?
[03:15.100 --> 03:16.080]  It's a movie.
[03:16.080 --> 03:18.860]  It's like the Spirit, maybe?
[03:19.240 --> 03:20.020]  What's that movie called?
[03:20.220 --> 03:20.820]  It's a great dumb movie.
[03:21.440 --> 03:23.960]  The Phantom, that sounds right.
[03:24.020 --> 03:24.680]  Is it the Wraith?
[03:26.180 --> 03:27.200]  Isn't it the Wraith?
[03:27.380 --> 03:28.860]  I think it's the Wraith.
[03:29.380 --> 03:34.160]  Charlie Sheen dies and then he possesses a car and he gets revenge on the people that killed him?
[03:34.480 --> 03:35.340]  What car is that?
[03:35.700 --> 03:36.480]  It's a great car.
[03:36.820 --> 03:38.740]  He should possess a Rolls Royce Wraith.
[03:39.100 --> 03:40.000]  I don't think it's that.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.100]  Have you not seen this movie?
[03:42.220 --> 03:42.600]  Anybody here?
[03:44.500 --> 03:45.220]  It's so good.
[03:45.720 --> 03:48.360]  Should we put it on the list?
[03:49.040 --> 03:50.380]  I think it's in contention.
[03:50.700 --> 03:51.540]  I don't know that it's a list.
[03:51.600 --> 03:52.660]  It could be a list movie.
[03:54.340 --> 03:57.520]  I'm not saying we should watch it, but I think it's definitely on the list.
[03:58.900 --> 04:00.140]  It's so sick.
[04:00.260 --> 04:01.300]  It's such a dumb movie.
[04:01.860 --> 04:03.320]  It's real fucking dumb.
[04:03.740 --> 04:05.140]  It's like real fucking dumb.
[04:05.460 --> 04:06.460]  I've never heard of that movie.
[04:06.460 --> 04:10.780]  I would love to throw down a cool car.
[04:11.140 --> 04:12.960]  Maybe even the car I drive.
[04:13.240 --> 04:15.200]  But if I'm being honest with you guys...
[04:15.200 --> 04:15.940]  I think I'm this.
[04:18.940 --> 04:22.460]  I think I'm a Jeep Grand Wagoneer with wood paneling.
[04:23.280 --> 04:24.600]  I think it's definitely the wood paneling.
[04:25.580 --> 04:26.020]  Absolutely.
[04:27.980 --> 04:29.380]  Sturdy wood paneling.
[04:29.620 --> 04:30.480]  A lot of room in there.
[04:30.860 --> 04:32.320]  Were you in a lot of those as a young'un?
[04:33.680 --> 04:35.360]  No more than anybody else.
[04:35.360 --> 04:36.560]  But I have been in them before.
[04:36.840 --> 04:39.760]  I definitely am extremely fond of that car.
[04:40.160 --> 04:42.420]  Is there a car that you...
[04:42.420 --> 04:44.880]  When you think about being a kid and being driven around...
[04:44.880 --> 04:46.900]  Going to do errands with your parents or whatever...
[04:46.900 --> 04:50.920]  Is there a car that you identify that with?
[04:51.260 --> 04:54.660]  It's very tied to you being in the back seat or the front seat.
[04:54.680 --> 04:54.980]  Yeah.
[04:55.320 --> 04:56.120]  Vauxhall Astra.
[04:56.820 --> 04:57.220]  A what?
[04:57.740 --> 04:58.780]  A Vauxhall Astra.
[04:59.680 --> 05:01.180]  A Vauxhall Astra?
[05:01.960 --> 05:02.440]  What?
[05:03.520 --> 05:04.780]  Yeah, you need to send one.
[05:04.780 --> 05:05.740]  Vauxhall?
[05:07.940 --> 05:08.640]  Vauxhall.
[05:09.160 --> 05:13.780]  Dude, I think me and Nick are talking about the same car.
[05:14.500 --> 05:18.920]  It is like a mid-80s...
[05:18.920 --> 05:21.040]  Whoa, Gavin, that's a...
[05:21.040 --> 05:21.300]  Whoa!
[05:22.220 --> 05:24.080]  That is...
[05:24.080 --> 05:26.220]  Yeah, imagine that but like a navy blue.
[05:26.620 --> 05:26.920]  Yeah.
[05:27.360 --> 05:32.200]  That was also where I gained all of my love for the 80s.
[05:32.200 --> 05:35.600]  Because it was all that my parents had on tape.
[05:36.220 --> 05:37.140]  It was just 80s music.
[05:38.200 --> 05:39.080]  This is...
[05:39.080 --> 05:42.120]  I mean, yeah, like me and Nick said, pretty much the same car.
[05:42.280 --> 05:45.240]  It's a mid-80s Honda Civic four-door sedan.
[05:45.900 --> 05:46.260]  Yes.
[05:46.560 --> 05:48.500]  And you're thinking Honda Civic, like it will be...
[05:48.500 --> 05:50.600]  Oh, yeah, you know, like an early 2000s Honda Civic.
[05:50.800 --> 05:51.180]  No, no.
[05:51.740 --> 05:53.360]  They used to be very different cars.
[05:53.660 --> 05:54.660]  And that is, man...
[05:54.660 --> 05:56.840]  That is like where I gained consciousness.
[05:57.420 --> 06:00.260]  Like, I became sentient in the back seat of...
[06:00.260 --> 06:03.400]  In 87 Honda Civic.
[06:07.400 --> 06:10.640]  I would have to say...
[06:10.640 --> 06:12.220]  This car.
[06:12.820 --> 06:15.720]  A 1972 Ford Courier pickup.
[06:16.220 --> 06:16.460]  Awesome.
[06:16.900 --> 06:17.940]  Wow, that's so American.
[06:18.100 --> 06:18.520]  That is a good one.
[06:18.740 --> 06:20.580]  My dad drove one of those.
[06:20.920 --> 06:23.680]  That actually, that car became a hand-me-down to me.
[06:23.780 --> 06:26.120]  It was my first car when I turned 16.
[06:26.720 --> 06:27.940]  And it was awesome.
[06:28.840 --> 06:29.300]  Except...
[06:29.300 --> 06:31.160]  That the driver's side door fell off.
[06:31.520 --> 06:32.980]  So my dad had it...
[06:32.980 --> 06:35.700]  My dad had it hooked up where...
[06:35.700 --> 06:37.820]  So you couldn't open the driver's side door.
[06:37.880 --> 06:39.620]  It was held on with a twisted coat hanger.
[06:40.180 --> 06:42.240]  So you had to get in through the passenger side.
[06:42.660 --> 06:44.070]  And by the time it got to me...
[06:44.480 --> 06:47.260]  The floorboard on the driver's side...
[06:47.260 --> 06:48.560]  Had completely fallen through.
[06:48.980 --> 06:50.800]  So you couldn't drive it in the rain.
[06:50.880 --> 06:52.030]  Or you would get splashed.
[06:55.260 --> 06:56.460]  That's so good.
[07:00.260 --> 07:01.460]  So there you go.
[07:02.080 --> 07:03.000]  What about you, Andrew?
[07:03.560 --> 07:05.380]  I don't... I'm terrible with car names.
[07:05.540 --> 07:06.040]  So it's...
[07:06.040 --> 07:08.560]  My childhood car that I think about...
[07:08.560 --> 07:10.220]  Is very similar to sort of what you...
[07:10.220 --> 07:12.120]  Like the color that you posted...
[07:12.120 --> 07:14.380]  With like the body of what Eric posted.
[07:15.160 --> 07:16.100]  I wish I knew.
[07:16.240 --> 07:17.900]  Maybe I'll do some research on this.
[07:18.520 --> 07:19.460]  Figure that out.
[07:20.520 --> 07:22.220]  Wow, what an unexpected turn.
[07:22.320 --> 07:23.080]  What cars we are.
[07:23.620 --> 07:25.520]  I love that if your car...
[07:25.520 --> 07:28.260]  You essentially were driving in a Flintstones vehicle.
[07:28.400 --> 07:29.080]  It sounds like, Geoff.
[07:29.220 --> 07:29.780]  Oh yeah.
[07:31.660 --> 07:33.220]  Did you ever Flintstone it?
[07:34.140 --> 07:35.040]  No, I never did.
[07:36.040 --> 07:36.880]  I had a...
[07:36.880 --> 07:39.480]  There was a girl...
[07:39.480 --> 07:41.160]  On my street who I was friends with.
[07:41.600 --> 07:43.040]  Who would...
[07:43.040 --> 07:44.980]  Sometimes get a ride to school with me.
[07:45.340 --> 07:47.440]  And she was so embarrassed to ride in my car.
[07:48.220 --> 07:49.520]  We worked it out ahead of time.
[07:49.560 --> 07:50.940]  She was like, I'll ride to school with you.
[07:51.020 --> 07:52.880]  But when we get to the school, I get to lay my head down.
[07:52.880 --> 07:54.020]  And nobody gets to see me in the car.
[07:54.140 --> 07:56.180]  And she would hide in my truck.
[07:56.440 --> 07:59.240]  As soon as we got close to the high school.
[07:59.380 --> 08:01.340]  Just so nobody saw her get in and out of my car.
[08:01.400 --> 08:02.200]  Well, I hope it wasn't raining.
[08:02.300 --> 08:03.940]  Because it sounds like she'd get a puddle in the face.
[08:05.420 --> 08:07.020]  I took the bus on rainy days.
[08:10.120 --> 08:10.680]  That's fantastic.
[08:11.740 --> 08:12.300]  Do you...
[08:12.300 --> 08:13.880]  Do you want to see a thing that I've got?
[08:14.200 --> 08:15.440]  I would love to see a thing that you've got.
[08:15.440 --> 08:16.840]  I've got some found footage.
[08:18.680 --> 08:20.440]  Oh my god, he's streaming.
[08:20.440 --> 08:22.860]  He's going, we've got to watch a live feed.
[08:23.000 --> 08:24.840]  I thought you were just going to have a clip.
[08:25.380 --> 08:27.580]  It is, but it's bigger than 25 meg.
[08:27.600 --> 08:28.640]  So we still don't have nitro.
[08:28.680 --> 08:30.300]  Oh, this looks like old found footage.
[08:30.440 --> 08:32.320]  We went over this. Eric won. We don't need nitro.
[08:32.620 --> 08:33.860]  Yeah, I won. Don't worry about it.
[08:34.240 --> 08:36.520]  Geoff just posted like three videos.
[08:36.700 --> 08:37.220]  But it's fine.
[08:37.740 --> 08:38.920]  Can everyone see this?
[08:39.040 --> 08:41.960]  This is footage from 2008.
[08:42.320 --> 08:44.900]  Almost 15 years to the month ago.
[08:45.760 --> 08:46.060]  Here we go.
[08:49.840 --> 08:50.580]  It's raining.
[08:54.230 --> 08:54.750]  Are you filming?
[08:55.810 --> 08:57.330]  No, my friend is filming this.
[08:57.410 --> 08:57.850]  Okay.
[09:01.190 --> 09:01.950]  Oh, look at you.
[09:02.290 --> 09:03.210]  Bouching a bow out.
[09:03.330 --> 09:03.590]  Oh!
[09:05.870 --> 09:07.130]  This is your character.
[09:07.810 --> 09:09.530]  Stuart the bumbling customer.
[09:20.300 --> 09:22.260]  What is Stuart looking for here?
[09:22.260 --> 09:22.940]  This is so great.
[09:25.860 --> 09:27.040]  This is awesome.
[09:29.120 --> 09:31.020]  Gavin, you're like Mr. Bean.
[09:31.200 --> 09:32.180]  This is fucking great.
[09:32.700 --> 09:34.420]  This is so fucking funny, dude.
[09:34.660 --> 09:36.180]  This is so...
[09:39.240 --> 09:41.520]  You're so like...
[09:42.260 --> 09:44.120]  The way you're doing it
[09:44.120 --> 09:46.260]  is so like nonchalant.
[09:47.020 --> 09:48.140]  This is so good.
[09:53.540 --> 09:54.320]  Well, you know,
[09:54.440 --> 09:56.320]  Gavin grew up... Gavin's from the same town
[09:56.320 --> 09:58.520]  as Mr. Bean, so maybe it's like a local thing.
[09:58.820 --> 09:58.940]  Yeah.
[10:00.360 --> 10:01.240]  Oh, we got a different shirt.
[10:01.540 --> 10:02.880]  This is a completely different store.
[10:03.140 --> 10:05.700]  Yeah, this is actually three different days.
[10:05.800 --> 10:08.740]  I had a Bouching a bow out shirt,
[10:09.080 --> 10:10.200]  a Grifball shirt,
[10:10.320 --> 10:11.420]  and I think...
[10:11.420 --> 10:14.240]  I think this is a shirt for Jason Saldana's
[10:14.240 --> 10:14.860]  old band.
[10:15.700 --> 10:16.140]  Wow!
[10:18.380 --> 10:18.820]  Crazy.
[10:18.820 --> 10:19.960]  That's crazy.
[10:22.540 --> 10:25.300]  I never want to see Stuart the Bumbling Custard
[10:25.300 --> 10:26.680]  in a store
[10:26.680 --> 10:28.840]  in person, but watching the footage
[10:28.840 --> 10:30.280]  of him was thrilling.
[10:30.760 --> 10:33.080]  I found so much
[10:33.080 --> 10:33.840]  joy there.
[10:34.740 --> 10:36.200]  It's quite early, Stuart.
[10:36.340 --> 10:38.680]  I would say Stuart escalated the antics
[10:38.680 --> 10:40.620]  as the years went on until he died
[10:40.620 --> 10:41.760]  maybe a couple of years later.
[10:42.500 --> 10:43.440]  He died.
[10:44.900 --> 10:46.440]  Yeah, we need to get the tombstones.
[10:46.440 --> 10:48.660]  We talked about this. We gotta find a grave spot
[10:48.660 --> 10:50.500]  for Stuart and Errol.
[10:51.200 --> 10:52.580]  Yeah, I'll try and find some more Stuart.
[10:52.680 --> 10:54.100]  I bet there's a ton more.
[10:54.440 --> 10:55.540]  That was a great video.
[10:56.200 --> 10:57.340]  That was an awesome video, Gavin.
[10:58.500 --> 11:00.520]  Did you guys see the video
[11:00.520 --> 11:02.080]  that was sent to us earlier in the week?
[11:02.920 --> 11:03.160]  No.
[11:04.020 --> 11:06.360]  No, you did. You absolutely saw it.
[11:06.420 --> 11:08.500]  You commented on it. You're the only one that commented on it.
[11:09.700 --> 11:10.940]  TPG emailed us
[11:11.420 --> 11:11.780]  something.
[11:12.200 --> 11:13.120]  And a video.
[11:13.860 --> 11:15.200]  One of the best videos
[11:15.200 --> 11:17.380]  I've seen in a long time. It made my night.
[11:17.560 --> 11:19.560]  I don't know if we want to...
[11:19.560 --> 11:21.220]  It would be a pain in the ass to insert
[11:21.220 --> 11:22.840]  the audio of it, but what a
[11:22.840 --> 11:23.620]  video.
[11:25.780 --> 11:26.580]  It's called
[11:27.440 --> 11:29.300]  A Spring Guy.
[11:30.240 --> 11:30.640]  What?
[11:32.580 --> 11:33.700]  It can be viewed here.
[11:34.140 --> 11:34.460]  Yeah.
[11:34.760 --> 11:36.780]  I talked to him about it ahead of time. He's fine with us
[11:36.780 --> 11:37.480]  using it.
[11:37.480 --> 11:39.420]  You guys ready?
[11:39.420 --> 11:40.820]  Yeah, let's watch this.
[11:40.820 --> 11:43.340]  This is from TPG. A Spring Guy.
[11:43.880 --> 11:45.200]  I used to be a real summer guy.
[11:45.860 --> 11:47.420]  I used to be a real winter kid.
[11:48.120 --> 11:49.500]  But now that I'm back in the
[11:49.500 --> 11:51.400]  northeast, I think
[11:51.400 --> 11:52.360]  I'm really becoming
[11:54.260 --> 11:55.560]  a spring guy.
[11:56.440 --> 11:56.880]  You see,
[11:57.140 --> 11:58.840]  there's something wonderful about spring.
[11:59.400 --> 12:01.700]  Look at all the little leaves coming back.
[12:02.080 --> 12:02.720]  Oh, look.
[12:03.100 --> 12:04.360]  My grass is still there.
[12:05.120 --> 12:05.960]  It's a drill.
[12:06.780 --> 12:08.060]  It's got me thinking
[12:08.060 --> 12:09.620]  a lot about the seasons.
[12:09.880 --> 12:11.640]  It's got me thinking a lot about weather.
[12:13.620 --> 12:14.080]  And I
[12:14.080 --> 12:16.360]  asked myself the other day
[12:16.360 --> 12:17.940]  when I was walking,
[12:18.760 --> 12:20.220]  checking out trees,
[12:21.240 --> 12:21.960]  are
[12:21.960 --> 12:23.800]  sunsets and sunrises
[12:23.800 --> 12:26.060]  weather? Are they no different
[12:26.060 --> 12:26.980]  than a rainstorm?
[12:27.980 --> 12:30.320]  After all, what is
[12:30.320 --> 12:32.000]  weather, if not
[12:33.060 --> 12:34.240]  nature's majesty?
[12:34.960 --> 12:36.040]  So my question
[12:36.040 --> 12:36.980]  for you bros,
[12:37.880 --> 12:38.780]  are sunsets
[12:40.320 --> 12:41.360]  or sunrises
[12:42.300 --> 12:42.820]  weather
[12:44.160 --> 12:45.200]  like rain?
[12:45.740 --> 12:46.860]  Does it even matter?
[12:47.660 --> 12:48.500]  Does it even matter?
[12:49.780 --> 12:50.820]  That's a great one.
[12:51.700 --> 12:54.240]  So people just listening to Dottie, it was a slow pan
[12:54.240 --> 12:55.920]  of a sunset of trees.
[12:56.640 --> 12:58.000]  It's like the ending of a
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.200]  John Hughes movie. It does have very
[13:00.200 --> 13:01.240]  strong John Hughes vibes.
[13:01.240 --> 13:03.220]  I love that he just makes these
[13:03.220 --> 13:04.420]  and sends them to us sometimes.
[13:04.460 --> 13:07.380]  It made my evening. I was so happy to see it.
[13:07.480 --> 13:09.300]  It was so good. And I think it's an important
[13:09.300 --> 13:11.360]  thing to answer. Yeah, and I commented
[13:11.360 --> 13:13.200]  on the unlisted YouTube
[13:13.200 --> 13:14.140]  link, so the only
[13:15.280 --> 13:17.200]  comment was from the
[13:17.200 --> 13:18.700]  slow-mo guy's account saying,
[13:18.840 --> 13:19.580]  yeah dude.
[13:25.500 --> 13:27.060]  Is sunsets and sunrises
[13:27.060 --> 13:27.820]  weather or no?
[13:28.520 --> 13:29.660]  I don't think so.
[13:29.700 --> 13:30.960]  I don't think that's how that works.
[13:31.320 --> 13:33.780]  Yeah, definitely not.
[13:34.100 --> 13:35.540]  No, not even close.
[13:35.780 --> 13:37.840]  But I would say a good sunset is
[13:37.840 --> 13:38.100]  weather.
[13:39.240 --> 13:41.840]  So a regular sunset is not weather, but a good
[13:41.840 --> 13:43.840]  sunset is weather. Well, the act of the sun
[13:43.840 --> 13:45.400]  setting isn't weather because it happens
[13:45.400 --> 13:47.780]  every day for everyone.
[13:48.220 --> 13:49.880]  But sometimes there's just some gnarly
[13:49.880 --> 13:50.780]  cloud in front of it.
[13:51.120 --> 13:53.740]  The oranges and the reds. That's not
[13:53.740 --> 13:55.340]  weather, dude. That's just gravity.
[13:55.340 --> 13:56.480]  Cloud is weather?
[13:57.780 --> 13:59.660]  But that's not the sunset, that's cloud.
[13:59.780 --> 14:00.520]  The cloud is weather.
[14:01.020 --> 14:01.740]  The sun
[14:03.280 --> 14:05.780]  setting is different to the total sunset.
[14:06.460 --> 14:07.740]  That's like saying, is a frog
[14:07.740 --> 14:09.300]  a car? Because they both go.
[14:12.080 --> 14:13.000]  This is great.
[14:13.860 --> 14:15.440]  A frog isn't a car, but if it is
[14:15.440 --> 14:17.380]  on top of a car, then it may
[14:17.380 --> 14:18.540]  in fact be a car.
[14:18.840 --> 14:21.420]  I think Tim had a great point
[14:21.420 --> 14:23.520]  where what is weather
[14:23.520 --> 14:25.020]  if not nature's majesty?
[14:28.380 --> 14:31.300]  Did you consider that?
[14:31.540 --> 14:32.260]  No, I didn't.
[14:32.780 --> 14:35.480]  It's a great counterpoint.
[14:36.080 --> 14:37.380]  I think my favorite
[14:37.380 --> 14:39.660]  counterpoint is, does it even matter?
[14:42.420 --> 14:43.780]  I don't think it does.
[14:44.420 --> 14:45.420]  This is truly
[14:45.420 --> 14:47.240]  a video created
[14:47.240 --> 14:49.320]  by a man
[14:49.320 --> 14:51.460]  going stir-crazy with three
[14:51.460 --> 14:53.280]  small children in a home
[14:53.280 --> 14:54.980]  in the American northeast.
[14:55.460 --> 14:57.480]  He is going nuts inside
[14:57.480 --> 14:59.120]  of a house and going, what is weather?
[14:59.260 --> 15:00.200]  Is it sunset?
[15:00.800 --> 15:03.440]  This is what happens when you have kids and live in the
[15:03.440 --> 15:03.760]  cold.
[15:06.940 --> 15:09.140]  It genuinely brought me so much joy
[15:09.140 --> 15:11.300]  to see that. I get so excited whenever we get
[15:11.300 --> 15:13.000]  a TPG email and a video.
[15:13.220 --> 15:15.120]  So good. That was brilliant.
[15:15.500 --> 15:17.400]  I like that the email was just called a spring
[15:17.400 --> 15:19.180]  guy and started the high bros.
[15:20.080 --> 15:21.140]  I gotta say,
[15:21.240 --> 15:23.440]  man, there is nobody
[15:23.440 --> 15:25.180]  else, at least
[15:25.180 --> 15:27.200]  in my experience, in my 47
[15:27.200 --> 15:29.280]  years on earth, I've never met anybody
[15:29.280 --> 15:31.000]  else quite like TPG.
[15:31.300 --> 15:33.000]  He is in
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.600]  every way a snowflake.
[15:34.920 --> 15:36.100]  He is individual.
[15:37.400 --> 15:38.420]  I knew
[15:39.740 --> 15:41.300]  that I was really on
[15:41.300 --> 15:43.160]  to someone different when I
[15:43.160 --> 15:45.160]  heard that sometimes he
[15:45.160 --> 15:47.220]  talked to Gavin and Gavin liked him.
[15:47.220 --> 15:48.100]  Yeah.
[15:49.160 --> 15:51.280]  That's like the highest
[15:51.280 --> 15:52.100]  bar to set.
[15:52.600 --> 15:55.300]  I felt the same way because he is someone who has to
[15:55.300 --> 15:57.340]  bug me a lot about various
[15:57.340 --> 15:58.180]  brand stuff.
[15:59.800 --> 16:01.060]  That's never a great
[16:01.060 --> 16:02.560]  relationship between anyone.
[16:03.120 --> 16:05.060]  For some reason, me and him, it just works.
[16:06.360 --> 16:06.860]  It's great.
[16:07.580 --> 16:08.360]  He is so good.
[16:09.300 --> 16:11.260]  I wonder if he knows how
[16:11.260 --> 16:12.220]  unique he is.
[16:12.860 --> 16:13.740]  I think he does.
[16:15.580 --> 16:16.220]  Hell of a
[16:16.220 --> 16:16.660]  guy.
[16:18.900 --> 16:19.860]  Yeah, dude!
[16:22.620 --> 16:24.020]  I went to re-watch
[16:24.020 --> 16:26.220]  that video last night and I didn't
[16:26.220 --> 16:27.980]  expect that and it cracked me up
[16:27.980 --> 16:30.060]  once again. I laughed so hard seeing you
[16:30.060 --> 16:31.720]  comment. Oh, that's brilliant.
[16:32.560 --> 16:33.880]  He is great.
[16:34.060 --> 16:34.800]  That is great.
[16:35.360 --> 16:37.660]  I've been trying a new thing
[16:37.660 --> 16:40.000]  that I wanted to bring up to you guys and then I wanted to see
[16:40.000 --> 16:41.820]  if you also had any interest in trying it.
[16:42.280 --> 16:43.060]  Just to see
[16:43.060 --> 16:44.720]  what the differences would be.
[16:45.080 --> 16:47.920]  I used to have a lot of my ideas
[16:49.020 --> 16:49.860]  in the shower
[16:49.860 --> 16:51.580]  but for whatever reason, I don't anymore.
[16:52.260 --> 16:53.940]  And then I had a period in my
[16:53.940 --> 16:55.880]  life where I would wake up at like 4 in the morning with an
[16:55.880 --> 16:57.920]  idea and I'd have to write it down and I don't do that anymore.
[16:58.480 --> 16:59.040]  But now,
[17:00.300 --> 17:01.900]  I find I have most of my
[17:01.900 --> 17:03.820]  ideas for stuff right after I
[17:03.820 --> 17:05.760]  wake up in the morning. So this week,
[17:06.160 --> 17:07.480]  I've been...
[17:07.480 --> 17:09.740]  I've made it a point to write
[17:09.740 --> 17:11.720]  down the first thing I think of when I
[17:11.720 --> 17:13.820]  wake up in the morning. Like my phone is next to me
[17:13.820 --> 17:15.740]  in my bed. And so the second I wake up
[17:15.740 --> 17:17.660]  and I realize I'm awake, I pick up my phone
[17:17.660 --> 17:19.600]  and then I write down the
[17:19.600 --> 17:21.620]  first thing that comes to my mind. Waking thoughts,
[17:21.700 --> 17:23.740]  yeah. And so I've got four for
[17:23.740 --> 17:25.600]  you I was going to share that I was going to see if you guys
[17:25.600 --> 17:26.700]  wanted to go ahead and try.
[17:27.900 --> 17:29.640]  If you wanted to try it as well.
[17:30.840 --> 17:31.160]  Okay.
[17:32.260 --> 17:33.660]  My first thought I had,
[17:33.680 --> 17:35.740]  I had this on Monday morning when I woke up, the first thing
[17:35.740 --> 17:37.640]  that came into my mind was, I wish
[17:37.640 --> 17:39.060]  my nickname was T-Bone.
[17:40.060 --> 17:41.260]  And if it was,
[17:42.140 --> 17:43.740]  if it was, I would get
[17:43.740 --> 17:45.340]  a tattoo of a T-Bone.
[17:45.540 --> 17:47.600]  And then I thought, if I get the
[17:47.600 --> 17:49.520]  tattoo of a T-Bone, can I
[17:49.520 --> 17:50.760]  backdoor into the nickname?
[17:53.000 --> 17:53.400]  Uh...
[17:53.400 --> 17:55.660]  Would you think so? Because Geoff has so
[17:55.660 --> 17:57.500]  many tattoos. I feel like it
[17:57.500 --> 17:59.760]  would be... Geoff, if you get a T-Bone
[17:59.760 --> 18:01.780]  tattoo and you want me to start calling you T-Bone,
[18:01.960 --> 18:03.480]  I'm in. I think I do.
[18:03.900 --> 18:06.160]  I think I want to be called
[18:06.160 --> 18:08.440]  T-Bone. I don't know why. What about G-Bone?
[18:08.960 --> 18:10.100]  That's exactly what I was
[18:10.100 --> 18:12.380]  going to say, Gavin. It could morph into G-Bone.
[18:12.560 --> 18:14.200]  Which got me thinking, and this
[18:14.200 --> 18:15.940]  now I'm going to take a bit of a...
[18:15.940 --> 18:18.100]  We're going to take a bit of an aside
[18:18.100 --> 18:20.400]  for a second. Have you guys...
[18:20.400 --> 18:21.840]  If you guys could pick your own nickname,
[18:22.480 --> 18:24.340]  what would you pick? Oh, man.
[18:24.600 --> 18:25.940]  You don't have to answer right now. It could be
[18:27.140 --> 18:27.780]  homework, but...
[18:27.780 --> 18:30.480]  You want to think, because this is how you're going to...
[18:30.480 --> 18:32.280]  You're choosing to self-identify to people
[18:32.280 --> 18:34.140]  for the rest of your life. So, like, what
[18:34.140 --> 18:36.020]  would you determine your nickname
[18:36.020 --> 18:37.920]  to be? Just something to think about. Maybe for...
[18:37.920 --> 18:40.160]  It's not going to be Raymond. Not that much.
[18:40.900 --> 18:42.080]  Cross that off the list.
[18:42.600 --> 18:44.000]  Yeah, I don't think I'd go with Errol.
[18:44.640 --> 18:44.860]  Yeah.
[18:45.760 --> 18:47.980]  Like, people call you Gavino, and
[18:47.980 --> 18:49.980]  Millie used to call you... Millie spent her entire childhood
[18:49.980 --> 18:52.000]  calling you Gaver. But, like, if
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.020]  you got to pick, what would you call yourself?
[18:54.700 --> 18:56.160]  I feel like it's so tough to come up
[18:56.160 --> 18:57.540]  with a nickname for yourself.
[18:57.900 --> 18:59.480]  Like, that's a good one.
[19:00.080 --> 19:01.300]  Yeah. Like the G-Bone.
[19:01.300 --> 19:03.320]  A T-Bone scenario. That's a very
[19:03.320 --> 19:05.280]  rare occurrence. I feel like
[19:05.280 --> 19:07.080]  you guys were throwing out, like, oh, Raymond
[19:07.080 --> 19:09.260]  and Errol and, like, regular names. But, like, you wouldn't
[19:09.260 --> 19:10.820]  go with something like Taskmaster?
[19:11.080 --> 19:13.420]  You know what I mean? Like, you wouldn't go, like, way further?
[19:14.320 --> 19:14.580]  Hmm.
[19:15.480 --> 19:16.800]  I think... I don't know.
[19:18.440 --> 19:19.140]  That example
[19:19.140 --> 19:20.420]  specifically feels tough.
[19:21.120 --> 19:23.140]  Yeah, so it should be along the lines of
[19:23.140 --> 19:25.220]  T-Bone. Along the lines of T-Bone. Yeah, or, like,
[19:25.240 --> 19:26.860]  whatever. Like, I knew a guy in high school... Prime Rib.
[19:28.100 --> 19:29.360]  That doesn't have to be steak
[19:29.360 --> 19:30.640]  related. But, like,
[19:31.460 --> 19:33.440]  although I realize I was about to say, I knew a guy in high
[19:33.440 --> 19:34.480]  school, everybody called him Meat.
[19:37.400 --> 19:38.140]  That's a good nickname.
[19:38.300 --> 19:38.760]  Hey, what's up, Meat?
[19:39.240 --> 19:41.660]  Why were all of your dudes just, like, one word?
[19:43.160 --> 19:43.800]  Like, Porch
[19:43.800 --> 19:44.620]  and Meat?
[19:45.280 --> 19:46.820]  Well, I wasn't friends with Porch.
[19:47.500 --> 19:48.600]  Porch scared the hell out of me.
[19:50.040 --> 19:50.680]  Uh, Fester.
[19:51.400 --> 19:53.260]  I just thought people had beat me up in the past.
[19:53.580 --> 19:55.400]  Do you think Fester or Porch have messaged you
[19:55.400 --> 19:56.640]  on Facebook in the last decade?
[19:56.640 --> 19:58.500]  I don't think...
[19:58.500 --> 20:00.620]  I don't think Fester and Porch know my name, and I hope
[20:00.620 --> 20:02.700]  they don't. I also don't know if either of those dudes
[20:02.700 --> 20:03.840]  are still alive, to be honest with you.
[20:04.600 --> 20:06.680]  They look like they were living pretty hard and fast
[20:06.680 --> 20:08.620]  and rough. Um, okay.
[20:08.900 --> 20:10.420]  Well, anyway, something to think about. Next,
[20:10.700 --> 20:12.740]  the Tuesday morning, the first thing I thought
[20:12.740 --> 20:14.360]  of when I woke up is
[20:15.300 --> 20:16.520]  all exit signs
[20:16.520 --> 20:18.720]  should be changed to just say leave.
[20:19.980 --> 20:20.800]  I don't know why.
[20:21.520 --> 20:22.640]  That was the first thing that popped into
[20:22.640 --> 20:24.580]  my head, is, like, I would rather see a sign that says
[20:24.580 --> 20:26.700]  leave than exit. I feel like it's more,
[20:27.180 --> 20:28.720]  uh, it's got more punch to it.
[20:28.900 --> 20:30.080]  An emergency leave?
[20:30.740 --> 20:31.120]  Yeah.
[20:32.460 --> 20:34.460]  Ooh, I like emergency lever.
[20:35.120 --> 20:36.540]  Yeah. Pull something like that.
[20:36.620 --> 20:38.220]  I like that. I like that combination.
[20:39.140 --> 20:40.680]  On, uh, on Wednesday,
[20:41.040 --> 20:42.700]  my first thing that popped into my head
[20:43.460 --> 20:44.560]  was just hot dogs.
[20:45.540 --> 20:46.580]  Just, just hot dogs.
[20:46.820 --> 20:48.680]  Really? Not eating them, not making them.
[20:48.860 --> 20:50.560]  Just them. Just thinking of a
[20:50.560 --> 20:52.540]  hot dog and a bun. That's what I woke up thinking about.
[20:52.540 --> 20:54.160]  I wasn't really craving them, I just
[20:54.160 --> 20:56.580]  hot dogs. Hot dogs. I had a
[20:56.580 --> 20:58.400]  I had a hot dog issue happen
[20:58.400 --> 21:00.500]  recently. There's a food truck
[21:00.500 --> 21:02.600]  festival that happens, like, once a month
[21:02.600 --> 21:04.360]  that I get excited to go to, and there's this
[21:04.360 --> 21:06.480]  barbecue one that's great. And the first
[21:06.480 --> 21:08.440]  time I went to it, they had hot dogs, and so I
[21:08.440 --> 21:10.420]  wanted to try the hot dog. And I typically
[21:11.400 --> 21:12.600]  only like, like
[21:12.600 --> 21:14.680]  ketchup on my hot dog, I'd say.
[21:14.920 --> 21:17.060]  Generally. And I, uh,
[21:17.060 --> 21:18.600]  I know in Chicago, there's that
[21:18.600 --> 21:20.580]  place that, like, they
[21:20.580 --> 21:22.540]  hate you if you ask for ketchup. I don't
[21:22.540 --> 21:24.700]  remember what that store is called. But I've
[21:24.700 --> 21:26.660]  created this in line for the hot
[21:26.660 --> 21:28.700]  dog. I created this scenario in my head
[21:28.700 --> 21:30.500]  where, uh, because they're barbecue
[21:30.500 --> 21:32.720]  people, they would share the same opinions, and
[21:32.720 --> 21:34.560]  they would look down upon me if I asked for
[21:34.560 --> 21:36.600]  ketchup on my hot dog, but I don't
[21:36.600 --> 21:38.580]  like anything else on it, so I just planned on
[21:38.580 --> 21:40.680]  ordering it plain, was my workaround.
[21:41.100 --> 21:42.100]  And so I got to the front,
[21:42.320 --> 21:44.520]  and they're like, what do you want? And I was like, I'll have a
[21:44.520 --> 21:46.260]  I'll have a plain hot dog, please.
[21:46.540 --> 21:48.840]  And the woman behind the counter looked visibly
[21:48.840 --> 21:50.720]  alarmed. It was so much
[21:50.720 --> 21:52.900]  worse than if I would have just said
[21:52.900 --> 21:54.240]  ketchup. And she was like, you want a
[21:54.660 --> 21:56.980]  plain hot dog? And I was like, yep, plain hot dog
[21:56.980 --> 21:58.720]  please. And she's like, okay,
[21:58.880 --> 22:00.840]  plain hot dog. And so
[22:00.840 --> 22:02.640]  they made it, and then
[22:02.640 --> 22:04.900]  the guy went to give it to me, and he's like, so you don't
[22:04.900 --> 22:06.800]  you don't even want, like, ketchup on this?
[22:07.520 --> 22:08.520]  And at that point,
[22:08.600 --> 22:10.740]  I was so committed to the plain
[22:10.740 --> 22:12.920]  hot dog, I, like, I just planned on putting
[22:12.920 --> 22:14.900]  ketchup on it when I got home. I was like, nah, just
[22:14.900 --> 22:16.340]  plain. I'll keep it plain.
[22:16.340 --> 22:18.200]  So I went with the plain
[22:18.200 --> 22:20.140]  hot dog out of fear they would think I was weird
[22:20.140 --> 22:22.260]  or, like, would look down upon me for the ketchup.
[22:22.540 --> 22:24.060]  And it was so much worse.
[22:24.200 --> 22:26.240]  They thought I was truly a
[22:26.240 --> 22:27.760]  psychopath for ordering.
[22:27.980 --> 22:30.140]  There was so much judgment. I did,
[22:30.380 --> 22:32.380]  in my attempt to avoid being the weird
[22:32.380 --> 22:34.320]  guy, I was in fact the weird guy
[22:34.320 --> 22:36.260]  with my hot dog, my plain hot dog.
[22:36.980 --> 22:37.840]  I went to
[22:38.320 --> 22:40.180]  Kentucky recently with Dan, and we just went
[22:40.180 --> 22:42.160]  to a restaurant that was, like, walking distance
[22:42.160 --> 22:43.760]  from a hotel, which
[22:43.760 --> 22:45.920]  I feel like everywhere I go that's like that
[22:45.920 --> 22:47.780]  I end up walking down a big,
[22:47.960 --> 22:49.880]  like, grass berm
[22:49.880 --> 22:51.820]  with just, like, a highway next to it.
[22:52.000 --> 22:53.140]  But we ended up at this restaurant.
[22:54.140 --> 22:55.840]  Dan got some fries, and, uh,
[22:56.160 --> 22:57.120]  and then he was like,
[22:57.540 --> 22:58.460]  yeah, can I have some mayo?
[22:59.460 --> 23:01.700]  And the woman just, like,
[23:01.740 --> 23:04.040]  looked so confused
[23:04.040 --> 23:05.620]  and then walked away to get some. And then
[23:05.620 --> 23:07.500]  halfway to, like, the kitchen, she
[23:07.500 --> 23:08.980]  turned around and came back
[23:09.600 --> 23:11.820]  and was like, I'm sorry, I'm just gonna go and get
[23:11.820 --> 23:13.300]  you your mayo, but I have to ask, like,
[23:13.660 --> 23:14.700]  what's it for?
[23:17.780 --> 23:19.380]  And Dan was like, I'm gonna put on my chips.
[23:19.580 --> 23:21.840]  And she was like, that, okay.
[23:22.380 --> 23:23.800]  And then she, I think she was, like,
[23:23.900 --> 23:26.120]  at her core, deeply disturbed
[23:26.120 --> 23:27.780]  by the idea of
[23:27.780 --> 23:29.580]  dipping your chips in ketchup.
[23:29.720 --> 23:31.740]  I mean, in mayo. Yeah, the American
[23:31.740 --> 23:33.220]  South doesn't do that.
[23:33.700 --> 23:35.720]  Yeah, it's a pretty popular thing in
[23:35.720 --> 23:37.620]  England. I think it's probably
[23:37.620 --> 23:39.740]  more accessible in North
[23:39.740 --> 23:41.520]  America, like North North America, too.
[23:42.340 --> 23:43.580]  I think it's more common, but
[23:43.580 --> 23:45.260]  it is definitely, it's
[23:45.260 --> 23:47.340]  ketchup or nothing in the South, pretty much.
[23:48.100 --> 23:49.940]  My kind of place, sounds like.
[23:51.180 --> 23:52.180]  Big ketchup guy.
[23:53.140 --> 23:54.000]  The last
[23:54.000 --> 23:55.540]  thought I had, I woke up this morning
[23:55.540 --> 23:57.400]  and the first thing that popped into my head,
[23:57.820 --> 23:59.700]  this was a more complicated thought, so I
[23:59.700 --> 24:01.580]  guess I'm getting better at capturing my
[24:01.580 --> 24:02.440]  actual
[24:03.560 --> 24:05.600]  deeper thoughts. Do you know how
[24:05.600 --> 24:07.600]  the Inuit have
[24:07.600 --> 24:09.380]  50 words for snow?
[24:10.080 --> 24:11.680]  Yeah. I feel
[24:11.680 --> 24:13.960]  like f***face, we're developing
[24:13.960 --> 24:15.700]  that many words for f***ing up.
[24:17.920 --> 24:19.440]  With salad creaming and
[24:19.440 --> 24:21.660]  gregging and f***face, it's like, I feel
[24:21.660 --> 24:23.740]  like we're gonna be, we're like,
[24:23.820 --> 24:25.760]  we're zeroing in, where we've
[24:25.760 --> 24:27.620]  developed, like, we're gonna develop, like, 50
[24:27.620 --> 24:29.420]  different ways, like, intricate
[24:29.420 --> 24:31.480]  ways to describe exactly the way
[24:31.480 --> 24:32.380]  a person f***s up.
[24:33.600 --> 24:35.360]  Yeah, we should, we should count.
[24:35.360 --> 24:37.260]  How many do we have? At least three,
[24:37.380 --> 24:39.080]  but I bet there's more. I mean, we've got
[24:39.080 --> 24:40.700]  Wilford Brimley, we've got Brimley in it.
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.700]  Oh, we've got Brimley in it, that's four.
[24:43.200 --> 24:45.160]  Yeah, there's probably twice as many
[24:45.160 --> 24:46.540]  as we can initially think of
[24:46.900 --> 24:48.040]  the history of this show.
[24:49.120 --> 24:51.180]  The audience will fill it in on us. But anyway, that's something to
[24:51.180 --> 24:51.620]  think about.
[24:56.960 --> 24:58.340]  We're really dialing in.
[24:58.840 --> 25:00.880]  I wrote one down the other morning,
[25:00.980 --> 25:02.780]  this was also, like, right after I woke up,
[25:02.780 --> 25:04.900]  and I don't really know why I wrote it in
[25:04.900 --> 25:06.740]  my f***ing face notes, because I just don't know
[25:06.740 --> 25:08.900]  what context this will be brought up. I just wrote,
[25:09.220 --> 25:10.580]  there's money in the leaf game.
[25:12.880 --> 25:14.820]  I think, I think what
[25:14.820 --> 25:16.940]  I was thinking is, how have so
[25:16.940 --> 25:18.880]  many people gotten so rich
[25:18.880 --> 25:20.880]  by just selling leaves?
[25:21.540 --> 25:22.500]  Like, just shit that,
[25:22.880 --> 25:24.780]  like, like lettuce. Like, the
[25:24.780 --> 25:26.640]  amount of different leaf
[25:26.640 --> 25:28.540]  industries that there are is
[25:28.540 --> 25:30.740]  unbelievable. Almost every plant you
[25:30.740 --> 25:32.640]  can sell. So you're saying that
[25:32.640 --> 25:34.800]  maybe we should get out of Geoff's idea of
[25:34.800 --> 25:36.620]  poison, doing the next poison,
[25:36.880 --> 25:38.660]  and maybe we need a leaf, is
[25:38.660 --> 25:39.880]  the direction we should go in.
[25:40.480 --> 25:41.900]  There might be more success in leaves?
[25:42.640 --> 25:44.620]  Yeah, I think I was just, like, thinking of the
[25:44.620 --> 25:46.640]  supermarket and how much, how much of it
[25:46.640 --> 25:47.740]  is you're buying different leaves.
[25:48.320 --> 25:50.820]  And that sort of connects to Geoff's leave sign.
[25:50.940 --> 25:52.700]  I think this is all connected. I think we need to
[25:52.700 --> 25:54.600]  pursue the leaf
[25:54.600 --> 25:56.640]  thing. There's something in the air
[25:56.640 --> 25:58.700]  with leaves. Right next to leave is
[25:58.700 --> 26:00.700]  leaves, and it's like, one
[26:00.700 --> 26:02.380]  door to get out, one door to salad.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.840]  Can we make, maybe instead
[26:04.840 --> 26:06.560]  of having signs that just say leave,
[26:06.660 --> 26:08.840]  maybe they need to be universal, because not everybody
[26:08.840 --> 26:10.800]  speaks English. Maybe it should just be a picture of a
[26:10.800 --> 26:12.700]  leaf. And that should be the
[26:12.700 --> 26:14.020]  universal symbol for get out.
[26:15.040 --> 26:16.840]  For exit, yeah. It makes sense
[26:16.840 --> 26:18.600]  though, because outside is leaves.
[26:19.540 --> 26:20.780]  Exactly. Does it
[26:20.780 --> 26:22.700]  make sense? It's where they naturally
[26:22.700 --> 26:24.720]  live. What do you mean, Andrew?
[26:25.180 --> 26:27.020]  I think if you put a sign
[26:27.020 --> 26:29.240]  of a leaf over a lot of doorways,
[26:29.340 --> 26:31.040]  I don't think people are going to interpret
[26:31.040 --> 26:32.940]  that as leave. This way to leave?
[26:33.520 --> 26:34.280]  Yeah, Nick is
[26:34.280 --> 26:37.100]  I don't think they're auto-filling on that. This is genius.
[26:37.920 --> 26:39.000]  Nick is right, because
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.860]  there's that phrase, like Nick just put in the chat,
[26:40.980 --> 26:42.960]  make like a tree and leave. It even makes more
[26:42.960 --> 26:43.420]  sense.
[26:45.380 --> 26:47.260]  I'm such a big fan
[26:47.260 --> 26:48.940]  of a thought process
[26:48.940 --> 26:51.300]  that is four steps removed
[26:51.300 --> 26:52.880]  from what the initial thing is,
[26:52.960 --> 26:54.600]  so no one could
[26:55.260 --> 26:56.800]  really follow the logic,
[26:56.900 --> 26:58.620]  but you could kind of see how they
[26:58.620 --> 26:59.680]  got there almost.
[27:00.240 --> 27:02.600]  Why don't we at RTX
[27:02.600 --> 27:04.740]  just put up a load of, I'm sure this is
[27:05.360 --> 27:06.720]  I'm sure this complies with
[27:06.720 --> 27:08.660]  code, cover up all the exit signs
[27:08.660 --> 27:10.800]  with leaves and see what happens.
[27:11.240 --> 27:12.580]  Listen, in the museum
[27:13.180 --> 27:14.340]  we can do that.
[27:14.620 --> 27:16.280]  We can control the museum.
[27:16.580 --> 27:18.100]  I was thinking, you know what else we should do in the museum?
[27:18.320 --> 27:20.420]  We should hang no scrumping signs everywhere.
[27:21.100 --> 27:22.380]  Yeah, it's important.
[27:22.380 --> 27:24.020]  Not as a part of the display,
[27:24.180 --> 27:26.080]  but as a like, hey, keep your fucking hands to yourself.
[27:27.680 --> 27:28.400]  But isn't scrumping
[27:28.400 --> 27:30.320]  just apples? Yeah, but we
[27:30.320 --> 27:31.460]  gotta make sure, you never know.
[27:32.480 --> 27:34.220]  In f*** face lore it could be anything.
[27:34.440 --> 27:36.400]  Scrumping is now synonymous with stealing in general
[27:36.400 --> 27:36.700]  I think.
[27:38.100 --> 27:40.280]  We could try and get that
[27:40.280 --> 27:41.800]  on the code of conduct for the convention.
[27:43.060 --> 27:44.580]  Oh, that's a very good idea.
[27:44.980 --> 27:46.340]  Let me pop into
[27:46.800 --> 27:48.620]  Yeah, let me get into a slack conversation
[27:48.620 --> 27:50.260]  real quick because I'm going to throw that out of
[27:50.260 --> 27:52.020]  the window and be like, hey, make sure this is in there. Thank you!
[27:52.920 --> 27:54.160]  Hey, Gav, can I ask you a question?
[27:54.580 --> 27:55.140]  For some advice?
[27:55.680 --> 27:57.040]  Do you know how you're from
[27:59.680 --> 28:00.000]  England
[28:00.360 --> 28:01.840]  and when you're in England
[28:01.840 --> 28:03.960]  you shit better than when you're in America?
[28:04.280 --> 28:06.260]  And you always talk about how when you come to America your shits are
[28:06.260 --> 28:06.920]  way worse.
[28:08.500 --> 28:09.820]  I'm going to Italy
[28:09.820 --> 28:11.680]  for vacation next week
[28:13.060 --> 28:14.060]  and I'm going to be there
[28:14.060 --> 28:16.060]  for a couple weeks and I got to thinking, how are
[28:16.060 --> 28:18.240]  Italian shits? Because you spend a lot of time there
[28:18.240 --> 28:20.220]  Will my shits be
[28:20.220 --> 28:20.900]  different in Italy?
[28:21.300 --> 28:23.780]  Here's the thing, and this might be just for me.
[28:23.980 --> 28:25.460]  My Italian shits are
[28:26.240 --> 28:27.200]  absolutely horrendous.
[28:27.600 --> 28:29.880]  I think it's because
[28:29.880 --> 28:32.020]  as I get older, I'm losing cheese.
[28:33.220 --> 28:34.180]  I think I'm
[28:34.180 --> 28:36.120]  becoming more and more allergic to
[28:36.120 --> 28:38.060]  dairy. Every time I
[28:38.060 --> 28:39.140]  eat cheese now, it
[28:39.920 --> 28:41.140]  never agrees with me.
[28:41.380 --> 28:43.040]  And you eat cheese constantly in Italy.
[28:43.800 --> 28:45.040]  Well, you know, it's in
[28:45.040 --> 28:47.280]  like a carbonara or like a pizza
[28:47.280 --> 28:49.040]  or sometimes
[28:49.040 --> 28:51.080]  you just have cheese. So I need
[28:51.080 --> 28:53.040]  to look forward to really bad
[28:53.040 --> 28:55.060]  shitting in Italy. I would prepare
[28:55.060 --> 28:56.920]  for it, yeah. I was hoping you'd be like,
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.880]  oh no, it's even better than England. You're going to have like
[28:58.880 --> 29:01.080]  tiny baby shits. And I was going to be like, oh great, I'm
[29:01.080 --> 29:02.960]  going to get like a two week vacation from
[29:02.960 --> 29:04.460]  my own butthole. But I guess not.
[29:04.920 --> 29:07.060]  Yeah, I wouldn't prepare for that. It sounds
[29:07.060 --> 29:08.680]  like you need to bring your shitting shades.
[29:09.580 --> 29:11.060]  You need to be, because
[29:11.060 --> 29:12.980]  it sounds like it's going to be a terrible time. You need something to
[29:12.980 --> 29:14.840]  counter that. Nothing better than the
[29:14.840 --> 29:16.540]  shitting shades to counter the bad shits.
[29:17.200 --> 29:18.800]  I will definitely bring my shitting shades. So even
[29:18.800 --> 29:21.040]  if I'm miserable, I'll at least look good doing it.
[29:21.900 --> 29:22.800]  Do you think we could
[29:22.800 --> 29:24.800]  petition Italy to change their
[29:24.800 --> 29:26.780]  flag to the image that
[29:26.780 --> 29:27.560]  Eric just posted?
[29:28.540 --> 29:29.340]  The hand?
[29:30.320 --> 29:31.680]  The pinched finger's hand.
[29:33.020 --> 29:34.400]  What's up with that? What's wrong with that?
[29:34.760 --> 29:35.280]  You like it?
[29:35.820 --> 29:38.860]  Have you ever been to Italy, Eric? No.
[29:39.320 --> 29:40.680]  That's 100% real.
[29:41.140 --> 29:41.980]  Oh, really?
[29:43.060 --> 29:44.640]  You'd see two Italian
[29:44.640 --> 29:46.840]  men getting into it. That is happening on both
[29:46.840 --> 29:47.180]  sides.
[29:49.680 --> 29:50.560]  It's pretty...
[29:50.560 --> 29:52.700]  I like it. You guys just started talking about Italy
[29:52.700 --> 29:54.860]  and I immediately started going, ooh, gotta find a pinchy
[29:54.860 --> 29:55.180]  fingers.
[29:56.840 --> 29:58.600]  Got it. I think it could be a flag.
[29:59.280 --> 30:00.860]  Canada has a maple leaf. Why can't
[30:00.860 --> 30:02.640]  Italy have the pinchy fingers thing?
[30:02.900 --> 30:04.120]  Leaf! Maple leaf!
[30:04.800 --> 30:06.180]  Leaves! There you go, money in the leaves.
[30:06.680 --> 30:08.640]  More leaves! I went to an
[30:08.640 --> 30:10.580]  Austin FC game like a week ago
[30:10.580 --> 30:12.100]  and we played Vancouver
[30:12.570 --> 30:14.640]  and they did the Canadian National Anthem before
[30:14.640 --> 30:16.320]  the American National Anthem and
[30:16.320 --> 30:18.620]  they had the Canadian flag up
[30:18.620 --> 30:20.560]  and it really kind of struck me
[30:21.180 --> 30:22.680]  like, oh, there's just like a leaf on
[30:22.680 --> 30:23.440]  this thing. Yeah.
[30:25.160 --> 30:26.480]  Like I knew it.
[30:26.620 --> 30:27.560]  You know, like intellectually
[30:28.300 --> 30:30.640]  you know something, but then it sort of like
[30:30.640 --> 30:32.300]  dawns on you. I guess.
[30:32.740 --> 30:34.660]  It was very weird. It was just like,
[30:34.900 --> 30:36.640]  huh. As someone who lives in Canada,
[30:36.640 --> 30:38.620]  it's very jarring for you to say. It would be like
[30:38.620 --> 30:40.680]  for me saying to you, I was at a
[30:40.680 --> 30:42.840]  game and I realized the American flag has stars
[30:42.840 --> 30:44.840]  on it. Like it's just, it's such a
[30:44.840 --> 30:46.520]  staple. It's the central part.
[30:46.920 --> 30:48.580]  But that's the thing, like if you would
[30:48.580 --> 30:50.660]  say that to me, I would know what you meant because I'd be like
[30:50.660 --> 30:52.500]  oh yeah, I guess I really never thought about how they are
[30:52.500 --> 30:54.200]  stars. Like
[30:54.840 --> 30:56.740]  that's a weird shape. That would be like
[30:56.740 --> 30:57.780]  oh yeah, it's just triangles.
[31:00.840 --> 31:02.520]  Like that's a weird thing to have.
[31:02.800 --> 31:04.880]  It's just straight. Like not, most flags
[31:04.880 --> 31:07.100]  are just colored striped blocks.
[31:07.320 --> 31:09.240]  What if the Italian flag
[31:09.240 --> 31:10.880]  just had 50 tiny pinch
[31:10.880 --> 31:12.020]  finger gestures on it?
[31:12.800 --> 31:14.640]  That's the best of all worlds.
[31:14.940 --> 31:16.760]  Each region of Italy.
[31:17.840 --> 31:18.620]  You put it,
[31:18.860 --> 31:20.800]  you put them on different sides so it's like
[31:20.800 --> 31:22.820]  they're facing each other so it's like an argument
[31:22.820 --> 31:24.980]  on the flag. It's great.
[31:25.480 --> 31:26.940]  It really lets you know what you're getting
[31:26.940 --> 31:28.120]  into going to Italy.
[31:30.840 --> 31:32.620]  Just be a bunch of pinch fingers
[31:32.620 --> 31:33.960]  and like a volcano in the middle.
[31:35.860 --> 31:36.820]  I didn't realize
[31:36.820 --> 31:38.680]  until, I probably was a
[31:38.680 --> 31:40.380]  teenager when I realized that the Union Jack
[31:40.380 --> 31:42.660]  isn't symmetrical and I hate
[31:42.660 --> 31:44.840]  looking at it now. It really pisses me off.
[31:45.380 --> 31:46.740]  Wait, what do you
[31:46.740 --> 31:47.520]  mean it's not symmetrical?
[31:48.160 --> 31:50.160]  The lines are not equal, right?
[31:50.180 --> 31:50.900]  It's a little off.
[31:52.060 --> 31:54.620]  Oh, what the fuck? Like you can have it the wrong
[31:54.620 --> 31:56.240]  way around and then you're like
[31:56.240 --> 31:58.640]  which way, the top right one has to
[31:58.640 --> 32:00.080]  be high and the bottom...
[32:00.080 --> 32:02.160]  What? I've never...
[32:02.160 --> 32:04.180]  What? That's dumb. Why wouldn't they just be in the
[32:04.180 --> 32:06.140]  middle? Yeah, I don't know.
[32:06.380 --> 32:07.920]  It was extra annoying
[32:07.920 --> 32:10.160]  when Rooster Teeth made
[32:10.160 --> 32:12.120]  the Vav shirt because it was
[32:12.120 --> 32:13.640]  like a Union Jack in a
[32:14.120 --> 32:15.540]  I think it was in a V shape.
[32:15.900 --> 32:18.240]  It looks so wrong because half of it
[32:18.800 --> 32:20.100]  like one of the lines is like
[32:20.100 --> 32:21.780]  missing on one side. Super annoying.
[32:22.060 --> 32:22.960]  Pisses me off all the time.
[32:24.580 --> 32:26.140]  Thankfully, if you live in England, you don't
[32:26.140 --> 32:27.980]  really see it that much because we don't
[32:27.980 --> 32:29.820]  we didn't put our own flag up everywhere.
[32:30.560 --> 32:32.000]  Geoff, do you have any flag complaints
[32:32.000 --> 32:33.880]  or flag thoughts you had
[32:33.880 --> 32:35.560]  waking up this week? No.
[32:36.100 --> 32:37.660]  Those were all the thoughts I had this week.
[32:37.740 --> 32:39.640]  I feel like I've honestly
[32:39.640 --> 32:42.100]  I haven't thought about flags a lot since our flag
[32:42.100 --> 32:44.060]  era. I'm excited
[32:44.060 --> 32:45.980]  to do the morning exercise
[32:45.980 --> 32:47.420]  of that. I've been trying to think of like
[32:47.900 --> 32:49.860]  what I've been thinking about. The only thing I can think of is
[32:49.860 --> 32:51.880]  where's the icing? That would have been one of the
[32:51.880 --> 32:53.260]  mornings. Yeah, that could be one, yeah.
[32:53.400 --> 32:55.880]  Just like the first thing because you don't really think about it when you're
[32:55.880 --> 32:57.560]  waking up. You're like, ugh, I'm awake.
[32:57.660 --> 33:00.060]  And then it's just like you get flooded
[33:00.060 --> 33:01.920]  with real thoughts
[33:01.920 --> 33:03.460]  but also just nonsense that's like
[33:03.460 --> 33:05.740]  hangover, like leftovers from a dream
[33:05.740 --> 33:07.240]  or whatever, you know. And it's just like
[33:07.240 --> 33:09.900]  interesting to see. I'm going to get a pad for my bedside.
[33:10.280 --> 33:12.080]  It's fun. You should do it.
[33:16.710 --> 33:17.970]  You ever ask yourself,
[33:18.630 --> 33:19.510]  what's HelloFresh?
[33:20.690 --> 33:22.450]  Thank God you came here
[33:22.450 --> 33:24.370]  because I have the answer for you.
[33:24.410 --> 33:26.730]  It is a farm-fresh, pre-portioned
[33:26.730 --> 33:28.730]  ingredient-filled
[33:28.730 --> 33:30.170]  seasonal recipe
[33:30.730 --> 33:32.770]  delivery system that jams
[33:32.770 --> 33:34.210]  it right up your doorstep.
[33:34.510 --> 33:37.050]  Skip trips to the grocery store. It sucks.
[33:37.170 --> 33:38.990]  It smells. People are rude.
[33:39.110 --> 33:40.490]  They're bumping into you left and right.
[33:40.710 --> 33:42.430]  They're squeezing the melons.
[33:42.530 --> 33:43.390]  It's disgusting.
[33:44.170 --> 33:46.610]  And you can count on HelloFresh to make
[33:46.610 --> 33:47.950]  home cooking easy.
[33:48.370 --> 33:50.030]  Cooking sucks. Not anymore.
[33:50.410 --> 33:52.430]  HelloFresh made it fun and affordable
[33:52.430 --> 33:54.630]  and that's why it's America's number
[33:54.630 --> 33:56.450]  one meal kit. All you other meal kits,
[33:56.750 --> 33:58.430]  get to the back of the line
[33:58.430 --> 34:00.550]  because you're number who cares?
[34:01.250 --> 34:02.370]  Did you know the flavor
[34:02.370 --> 34:04.370]  is in full bloom at HelloFresh?
[34:04.450 --> 34:05.990]  Did you know flavor blooms?
[34:06.330 --> 34:08.610]  Apparently it does. And you can enjoy
[34:08.610 --> 34:10.070]  the taste of spring with
[34:10.070 --> 34:12.670]  chef-crafted recipes featuring ripe
[34:12.670 --> 34:14.610]  always ripe. You don't want them over-ripe.
[34:14.670 --> 34:16.310]  You don't want them under-ripe. Seasonal
[34:16.310 --> 34:18.630]  ingredients delivered right to your door.
[34:18.970 --> 34:20.510]  They know where you live.
[34:20.890 --> 34:22.710]  HelloFresh does more than just
[34:22.710 --> 34:25.090]  delicious dinners. It also
[34:25.750 --> 34:26.650]  lets you pick
[34:26.650 --> 34:28.790]  from 40 weekly recipes.
[34:29.390 --> 34:30.490]  That's insane because there's only
[34:30.490 --> 34:32.910]  7 days in a week. How are you going to eat all 40 recipes?
[34:33.130 --> 34:34.590]  You're not. But you can
[34:34.590 --> 34:36.890]  also choose from over 100 items
[34:36.890 --> 34:38.570]  to round out your order. Everybody
[34:38.570 --> 34:40.490]  loves snacks, right? I like to snack.
[34:40.570 --> 34:42.550]  You like to snack. Snacking is essential.
[34:42.670 --> 34:45.010]  It's an essential part of the day. Easy lunches
[34:45.010 --> 34:46.190]  to desserts.
[34:47.270 --> 34:48.150]  Mmm. Dessert.
[34:48.630 --> 34:50.550]  With pantry necessities. Everything
[34:50.550 --> 34:52.530]  arrives in your box on a delivery
[34:52.530 --> 34:54.690]  day that you choose. Imagine
[34:54.690 --> 34:56.650]  you choose when the mail comes to you.
[34:56.930 --> 34:57.950]  It's insanity.
[34:58.590 --> 35:00.570]  And hey, no worries if you're
[35:00.570 --> 35:02.650]  not a pro in the kitchen. Neither is this
[35:02.650 --> 35:04.310]  idiot. But HelloFresh's
[35:04.310 --> 35:06.850]  foolproof recipes arrive pre-portioned
[35:06.850 --> 35:08.570]  and easy to prepare in
[35:08.570 --> 35:10.610]  just a few steps. And everybody
[35:10.610 --> 35:12.030]  likes taking steps.
[35:12.670 --> 35:14.550]  So go to HelloFresh.com
[35:15.290 --> 35:16.370]  slash face

[35:27.810 --> 35:29.830]  HelloFresh.com slash face16
[35:29.830 --> 35:32.390]  using code face16 for how many?
[35:32.510 --> 35:34.190]  I already told you. 16
[35:34.190 --> 35:35.770]  free meals plus
[35:35.770 --> 35:37.830]  free shipping. That's
[35:37.830 --> 35:39.970]  HelloFresh. America's number
[35:39.970 --> 35:40.690]  one meal kit.
[35:42.310 --> 35:44.130]  Hey. You. Yeah.
[35:44.230 --> 35:46.190]  Everyone. I'm talking to all of you.
[35:46.190 --> 35:47.910]  We wanted to take a moment
[35:47.910 --> 35:49.330]  to remind you.
[35:49.710 --> 35:52.150]  Now I'm not talking to him or her. I'm talking specifically to you.
[35:52.350 --> 35:53.790]  We want to remind you that
[35:53.790 --> 35:56.030]  RTX 2023 is
[35:56.030 --> 35:57.930]  happening this July 7th
[35:57.930 --> 35:59.630]  through this July 9th.
[35:59.910 --> 36:01.790]  That includes July 8th. You're getting
[36:01.790 --> 36:03.870]  the 7th. You're getting the 8th. And
[36:03.870 --> 36:05.890]  you're getting the 9th. All in July.
[36:06.130 --> 36:07.630]  All in Austin. All
[36:07.630 --> 36:10.010]  2023. It's our favorite
[36:10.010 --> 36:11.750]  time of the year when we get to interact with
[36:11.750 --> 36:14.190]  all the amazing people that give us the
[36:14.190 --> 36:15.770]  opportunity to make all of this mediocre
[36:15.770 --> 36:17.510]  content. It is a celebration
[36:17.510 --> 36:19.150]  of all things Rooster Teeth.
[36:19.710 --> 36:21.670]  With panels, special guests,
[36:21.910 --> 36:23.630]  community artists, cosplay.
[36:23.750 --> 36:25.570]  The kids love cosplay these days. And
[36:25.570 --> 36:28.030]  even more. There'll be exclusive reveals,
[36:28.410 --> 36:29.650]  meet and greets with Rooster Teeth
[36:29.990 --> 36:31.530]  talent. And I said talent in quotes.
[36:31.890 --> 36:33.650]  And special merch available only
[36:33.650 --> 36:35.690]  during the event. That part's actually pretty
[36:35.690 --> 36:37.830]  cool. We're changing up how the convention
[36:37.830 --> 36:39.910]  feels this year and it's going to be awesome.
[36:40.270 --> 36:42.050]  Imagine a mini Epcot-style
[36:42.050 --> 36:44.070]  convention center show floor with
[36:44.070 --> 36:46.130]  different attractions and activations from your favorite
[36:46.130 --> 36:48.150]  Rooster Teeth brands all wrapped up
[36:48.150 --> 36:49.790]  in a summer camp theme. Except
[36:49.790 --> 36:51.750]  unlike Epcot, we're not trying to teach you
[36:51.750 --> 36:53.970]  anything. It is the summer camp
[36:53.970 --> 36:55.870]  for indoor kids. With face jams,
[36:56.090 --> 36:58.110]  rat and grackle pub, the red web
[36:58.110 --> 37:00.210]  escape room, and a f*** face
[37:00.210 --> 37:02.270]  museum that has to be seen
[37:02.270 --> 37:04.030]  to be believed. Also
[37:04.030 --> 37:05.970]  Achievement Hunter Mini Golf is making an appearance
[37:05.970 --> 37:07.890]  and even more cool stuff to do
[37:07.890 --> 37:09.810]  that we're saving for the attendees
[37:09.810 --> 37:11.950]  to experience. I can't even tell
[37:11.950 --> 37:13.830]  you about it. Thanks for listening
[37:13.830 --> 37:15.670]  to me get very excited about
[37:15.670 --> 37:17.850]  RTX. We're looking forward to meeting all
[37:17.850 --> 37:19.570]  of you there. So head on over to
[37:20.210 --> 37:20.650]  www.
[37:23.370 --> 37:23.810]  r

[37:30.750 --> 37:31.990]  to get more information
[37:31.990 --> 37:33.750]  about the event and to buy

[37:35.990 --> 37:37.790]  And maybe a badge for your co-worker.
[37:37.790 --> 37:40.030]  Maybe a badge for an acquaintance
[37:40.030 --> 37:41.110]  who you would like to be a friend.
[37:42.050 --> 37:43.010]  Badge, badge, badge!
[37:43.910 --> 37:45.530]  This show is sponsored by
[37:45.530 --> 37:47.770]  BetterHelp. I don't know about you
[37:47.770 --> 37:49.950]  but as a parent
[37:49.950 --> 37:51.630]  and then also
[37:51.630 --> 37:53.690]  as the co-founder of a company, I spend
[37:53.690 --> 37:55.510]  a lot of time caring
[37:55.510 --> 37:57.110]  and loving
[37:57.610 --> 37:59.110]  and worrying about other people.
[37:59.690 --> 38:01.710]  And I think as tends
[38:01.710 --> 38:03.810]  to be the case as we get older in life
[38:04.570 --> 38:05.790]  and our loved
[38:05.790 --> 38:06.850]  ones get older
[38:07.750 --> 38:09.490]  on both ends of the dial there.
[38:09.910 --> 38:10.830]  Kids and parents.
[38:11.950 --> 38:13.770]  And life gets more complicated.
[38:14.030 --> 38:15.630]  You find, I think, less time
[38:15.630 --> 38:17.650]  to kind of focus on you because you're so
[38:17.650 --> 38:18.730]  busy worried about
[38:19.890 --> 38:21.290]  saving for the kids' college
[38:21.570 --> 38:23.690]  or making sure that your mom's
[38:23.690 --> 38:24.290]  doing alright
[38:25.250 --> 38:27.350]  all the way over there in Alabama by herself.
[38:27.630 --> 38:28.810]  And that's why
[38:28.810 --> 38:31.710]  it's really easy to get caught
[38:31.710 --> 38:33.510]  up in what everyone else needs from you
[38:33.510 --> 38:35.130]  because people need stuff from you
[38:35.130 --> 38:37.190]  and you're important to them and they're important to you
[38:37.190 --> 38:39.410]  and that's kind of how the symbiosis
[38:39.410 --> 38:40.910]  of life works. But
[38:40.910 --> 38:43.390]  it makes it hard sometimes for you to take a moment
[38:43.390 --> 38:45.710]  to think about what you really need for yourself.
[38:46.550 --> 38:47.490]  Like for me
[38:47.490 --> 38:49.150]  I've learned that
[38:49.730 --> 38:51.490]  I need a certain amount
[38:51.490 --> 38:53.530]  of time to myself every day
[38:53.530 --> 38:55.350]  to go for a walk or to
[38:55.350 --> 38:55.970]  bike ride.
[38:57.170 --> 38:59.710]  I've been experimenting with running. It's not going great.
[39:00.190 --> 39:01.450]  But just to kind of clear my head
[39:01.450 --> 39:03.510]  and kind of give me a
[39:03.510 --> 39:05.590]  moment to kind of focus and ground.
[39:06.030 --> 39:06.390]  And also
[39:07.450 --> 39:08.470]  I need therapy.
[39:09.190 --> 39:11.590]  Every week of my life, I need therapy.
[39:11.930 --> 39:13.010]  And I make sure to get it.
[39:13.490 --> 39:15.510]  It's something you've got to watch out for because when you spend
[39:15.510 --> 39:17.570]  all of your time giving, it can leave
[39:17.570 --> 39:19.510]  you feeling stretched thin and burned
[39:19.510 --> 39:21.790]  out. And if you don't have time
[39:22.350 --> 39:23.370]  and energy for
[39:24.030 --> 39:25.630]  you and what you need, how are you
[39:25.630 --> 39:27.210]  supposed to take care of those around you?
[39:27.790 --> 39:29.330]  Therapy can give you the tools
[39:29.330 --> 39:31.210]  to find more balance in your life so
[39:31.210 --> 39:32.890]  that you can keep supporting others
[39:33.250 --> 39:34.650]  without leaving yourself behind.
[39:35.450 --> 39:37.330]  Because once again, if you can't
[39:37.330 --> 39:39.170]  take care of your needs first, then
[39:39.170 --> 39:41.050]  you're going to fall flat
[39:41.050 --> 39:43.330]  everywhere else. And you're not going to be able to take care of the needs
[39:43.330 --> 39:45.390]  of others and the people that matter to you
[39:45.390 --> 39:46.850]  most. I've been in therapy
[39:48.010 --> 39:49.410]  well, about as long
[39:49.410 --> 39:51.250]  as I can remember at this point. And I don't know what I
[39:51.250 --> 39:53.310]  would do without it. It's become like
[39:53.310 --> 39:54.970]  this kind of sacrosanct
[39:55.770 --> 39:57.270]  perfect hour in the week
[39:57.270 --> 39:59.310]  where I can kind of go into
[39:59.310 --> 40:00.650]  a bubble and just
[40:02.730 --> 40:03.330]  kind of
[40:03.330 --> 40:05.430]  process and think about the problems
[40:05.430 --> 40:07.330]  in my life, think about the issues, think
[40:07.330 --> 40:09.490]  about, you know, the things
[40:09.490 --> 40:11.070]  that are nagging me from the past
[40:11.070 --> 40:13.030]  and work through it with someone
[40:13.030 --> 40:15.430]  who understands me and
[40:15.430 --> 40:17.430]  who is an unbiased
[40:18.010 --> 40:18.870]  nonjudgmental ear
[40:20.150 --> 40:21.430]  who just kind of helps
[40:21.430 --> 40:23.470]  me navigate these things. And it's
[40:23.470 --> 40:25.330]  become invaluable to me. I don't know what
[40:25.330 --> 40:27.370]  I would do without it. So if you're thinking about
[40:27.370 --> 40:29.490]  maybe taking some time for you
[40:29.490 --> 40:31.530]  maybe to talk to somebody who isn't
[40:31.530 --> 40:33.510]  already embroiled in your life
[40:33.510 --> 40:35.450]  like a friend or family member
[40:35.450 --> 40:37.570]  somebody who's kind of on the outside
[40:37.570 --> 40:39.270]  who is completely unbiased
[40:39.270 --> 40:41.330]  and who can listen with a critical
[40:41.330 --> 40:43.190]  ear and a kind ear
[40:43.190 --> 40:45.010]  maybe give BetterHelp a try.

[40:59.150 --> 41:00.990]  the perfect therapist for you. I've seen a few
[41:00.990 --> 41:03.090]  over the years and it's... sometimes
[41:03.090 --> 41:04.930]  it takes a while to find the person who just like
[41:04.930 --> 41:07.390]  kind of matches who you are

[41:28.790 --> 41:29.150]  Hey,
[41:30.170 --> 41:30.530]  uh...
[41:31.070 --> 41:32.610]  Can I ask you guys an opinion on something?
[41:33.150 --> 41:35.250]  Of course! I got into a disagreement
[41:35.250 --> 41:36.870]  with Eric a couple weeks ago.
[41:37.390 --> 41:39.050]  Oh, then I want to tell you guys about how I f***ed
[41:39.050 --> 41:41.010]  myself. I've been meaning to tell you guys this for
[41:41.010 --> 41:41.850]  like two months.
[41:43.690 --> 41:45.290]  But uh... I got into a disagreement
[41:45.290 --> 41:47.230]  with Eric the other day and I wanted to see how you guys
[41:47.230 --> 41:49.250]  felt about it. And I bet Eric doesn't even know what I'm talking about.
[41:49.250 --> 41:51.250]  But I was uh...
[41:51.830 --> 41:52.630]  I was
[41:53.270 --> 41:55.250]  at RT to film something.
[41:55.530 --> 41:57.010]  I think I was doing promos or something.
[41:57.730 --> 41:59.290]  And I realized
[41:59.290 --> 42:01.290]  right as we were about to go that I
[42:01.290 --> 42:03.610]  had to pee. And
[42:03.610 --> 42:05.370]  Eric was like, well let's just go
[42:05.370 --> 42:07.250]  pee and come back and we'll do it. And I was like
[42:07.250 --> 42:09.390]  no! I'd rather do
[42:09.390 --> 42:10.830]  it having to pee
[42:10.830 --> 42:11.770]  because the
[42:13.810 --> 42:15.090]  immediacy of needing to pee
[42:15.090 --> 42:16.630]  will make me sharper and better.
[42:16.630 --> 42:18.770]  Because I'll do
[42:18.770 --> 42:20.610]  it first take because I have
[42:20.610 --> 42:22.290]  the impetus to pee. So
[42:22.290 --> 42:24.690]  peeing, needing to pee, makes
[42:24.690 --> 42:26.690]  you a better performer. And he said
[42:26.690 --> 42:28.190]  I was an idiot. No.
[42:28.650 --> 42:30.590]  Not at all. I get what
[42:30.590 --> 42:32.650]  you're saying, but I think in the
[42:32.650 --> 42:34.570]  context of like what we were gonna
[42:34.570 --> 42:36.690]  film, it was like oh I
[42:36.690 --> 42:38.530]  don't... that's not what I'm looking...
[42:38.530 --> 42:39.670]  I'm not looking for that.
[42:40.730 --> 42:42.290]  Just go pee. But you said
[42:42.290 --> 42:44.530]  needing to pee doesn't make you better at stuff.
[42:44.530 --> 42:45.570]  You told me that and I disagree.
[42:45.750 --> 42:47.910]  I think I get what you're coming with
[42:47.910 --> 42:50.390]  with the energy, but I don't think
[42:51.030 --> 42:52.370]  I'm getting a better performance
[42:52.370 --> 42:53.870]  from you because you need to go pee.
[42:54.230 --> 42:56.190]  I disagree. I disagree. So you
[42:56.190 --> 42:58.270]  don't think it works the same way as Icy Hot?
[42:59.110 --> 42:59.910]  Right. Which
[43:00.750 --> 43:02.410]  I don't know if that made us
[43:02.410 --> 43:04.450]  better performers all around
[43:05.950 --> 43:06.350]  but...
[43:06.810 --> 43:08.350]  So I'm... jury's still out
[43:08.350 --> 43:10.490]  maybe on the Icy Hot also. If you have
[43:10.490 --> 43:12.670]  to pee and you do Icy Hot
[43:13.410 --> 43:14.210]  are you
[43:14.750 --> 43:16.090]  at like peak level?
[43:16.630 --> 43:18.810]  Well, listen, if you're doing the Icy
[43:18.810 --> 43:20.550]  Hot and you have to pee, that's a very dangerous
[43:20.550 --> 43:22.410]  hand situation you got going on.
[43:22.890 --> 43:24.910]  There's other factors you need to worry about.
[43:25.310 --> 43:26.730]  I would also say that's a scenario
[43:26.730 --> 43:27.750]  for pissing your pants.
[43:28.830 --> 43:30.470]  I could see how that could go
[43:30.470 --> 43:31.590]  terribly wrong.
[43:32.570 --> 43:34.670]  What do you mean by that? Just cause I'm
[43:34.670 --> 43:36.270]  like clenching and wriggling around
[43:36.270 --> 43:38.270]  and I might piss my pants.
[43:38.610 --> 43:40.570]  And your focus is split. It's split between
[43:40.570 --> 43:42.690]  having to pee, the pain
[43:42.690 --> 43:44.750]  of the Icy Hot and whatever you're trying to focus
[43:44.750 --> 43:46.590]  on. That's dangerous. That is
[43:46.590 --> 43:48.710]  a great point. That being said
[43:48.710 --> 43:50.790]  if you can pull it off without pissing
[43:50.790 --> 43:52.810]  your pants, it'll probably be the best performance of your life.
[43:53.570 --> 43:54.690]  I think it becomes more
[43:54.690 --> 43:56.630]  impressive. The performance, like, even
[43:56.630 --> 43:58.790]  if it's not the best, when you hear that that guy
[43:58.790 --> 44:00.630]  was dealing with Icy Hot and had
[44:00.630 --> 44:01.930]  to pee, it's like, holy shit.
[44:02.650 --> 44:04.710]  That guy had Icy Hot all over
[44:04.710 --> 44:06.610]  his balls and he had to pee
[44:06.610 --> 44:08.730]  so bad the whole time.
[44:08.730 --> 44:10.890]  Daniel Day-Lewis filmed the entire film
[44:10.890 --> 44:12.870]  needing to pee with Icy Hot
[44:12.870 --> 44:13.930]  all over his body.
[44:14.510 --> 44:16.510]  Give him six Oscars. That's how they filmed the Scorsese movie.
[44:16.850 --> 44:18.610]  They just had DiCaprio with Icy Hot
[44:18.610 --> 44:20.510]  balls needing to pee.
[44:20.930 --> 44:22.950]  I heard that's why Revenant's so good.
[44:26.310 --> 44:28.910]  What do you think makes more of an impact? Needing to pee
[44:28.910 --> 44:29.730]  or needing to poo?
[44:31.050 --> 44:32.650]  Oh, uh, pee.
[44:33.050 --> 44:35.130]  Pee, pee. I can hold a
[44:35.130 --> 44:36.090]  poo forever, yeah.
[44:36.510 --> 44:38.330]  Yeah, I feel like a poo can retreat
[44:38.330 --> 44:38.810]  a little.
[44:39.650 --> 44:42.330]  I feel like you've got more leeway with a poo.
[44:42.570 --> 44:43.650]  Yeah, but piss is piss.
[44:43.790 --> 44:44.750]  It's going nowhere.
[44:45.810 --> 44:47.810]  And the older you get, too, it's like
[44:47.810 --> 44:49.890]  there's no gentle ramp up of like,
[44:49.950 --> 44:52.030]  oh, I need to pee eventually. It's like, when you
[44:52.030 --> 44:53.590]  hit your 40s, you're like, I need to pee
[44:53.590 --> 44:55.070]  and I need to pee yesterday.
[44:56.330 --> 44:57.750]  Then why did you hold it?
[44:58.350 --> 45:00.250]  To get through, to do a better job
[45:00.250 --> 45:01.970]  for you because I wanted to do the best job
[45:01.970 --> 45:04.090]  possible. Geoff is a clutch
[45:04.090 --> 45:06.110]  performer and he just needed to set the
[45:06.110 --> 45:08.230]  stakes for him to have that clutch performance.
[45:08.430 --> 45:10.110]  He keeps saying it's for me
[45:10.110 --> 45:11.750]  and it's not for me.
[45:11.970 --> 45:13.970]  It was all for you, Eric. This is like RTX
[45:13.970 --> 45:15.550]  stuff and it's not for me.
[45:15.750 --> 45:18.390]  You're the one that asked me to do it, and so I did it.
[45:19.190 --> 45:20.050]  I agree with you
[45:20.050 --> 45:21.990]  completely, Geoff. Do you have anything that makes you
[45:21.990 --> 45:23.510]  sweat that isn't heat-related?
[45:24.710 --> 45:24.790]  What?
[45:26.470 --> 45:27.430]  Uh, yeah.
[45:27.750 --> 45:29.650]  This happened the other day.
[45:30.130 --> 45:31.710]  I was doing
[45:31.710 --> 45:33.990]  face-jam social stuff with Nick
[45:33.990 --> 45:35.670]  and we filmed, I mean
[45:35.670 --> 45:37.770]  hopefully it's out by this time, we filmed
[45:37.770 --> 45:39.730]  with Kenny Omega from AEW and Paul
[45:39.730 --> 45:41.410]  Scheer from Human Giant.
[45:42.410 --> 45:43.850]  And for some
[45:43.850 --> 45:45.810]  reason, it was fine all day. I had
[45:45.810 --> 45:47.590]  no problem, whatever. As soon as I started
[45:47.590 --> 45:49.290]  asking them questions, like performing
[45:49.290 --> 45:51.870]  to ask them these questions, I
[45:51.870 --> 45:53.670]  was sweating so
[45:53.670 --> 45:55.550]  hard and I wasn't on
[45:55.550 --> 45:57.830]  camera. I was behind the camera
[45:57.830 --> 45:59.670]  asking questions and I was just
[45:59.670 --> 46:00.230]  sweating.
[46:01.950 --> 46:03.730]  I don't know why, but it was
[46:03.730 --> 46:05.610]  really distinct. It stuck out to me and I just
[46:05.610 --> 46:07.850]  went, I'm soaked right
[46:07.850 --> 46:09.230]  now. Crazy.
[46:09.750 --> 46:11.750]  I get soaked to the bone if I have
[46:11.750 --> 46:13.710]  to vomit. Like if I'm nauseous, I
[46:13.710 --> 46:15.190]  sweat like crazy.
[46:15.670 --> 46:17.310]  That's the thing that comes to mind.
[46:17.790 --> 46:19.110]  I had one the other day, I had a,
[46:19.470 --> 46:21.610]  as I get older, I'm the hairiest person
[46:21.610 --> 46:23.590]  I know and it just goes to
[46:23.590 --> 46:25.550]  new places. So I waxed the
[46:25.550 --> 46:27.170]  top part of my back
[46:27.170 --> 46:29.290]  and it was so painful
[46:29.290 --> 46:31.310]  and I just, my entire
[46:31.310 --> 46:33.270]  body just filled with sweat. If I did
[46:33.270 --> 46:35.190]  like five wax strips on my
[46:35.190 --> 46:37.250]  back and then put a shirt on, I would soak right
[46:37.250 --> 46:37.870]  through it, I think.
[46:38.810 --> 46:39.830]  Nothing to do with heat.
[46:41.550 --> 46:43.390]  Are you, do you
[46:43.390 --> 46:44.930]  like pit out on shirts?
[46:45.490 --> 46:47.370]  Like, do you like, if you wear like a grey
[46:47.370 --> 46:48.850]  shirt, do you get like big sweat
[46:48.850 --> 46:50.490]  like pit stains?
[46:51.350 --> 46:53.270]  I think, well, yeah, if I'm like sat
[46:53.270 --> 46:54.310]  at a desk, I do.
[46:54.310 --> 46:55.010]  Okay.
[46:55.750 --> 46:57.470]  It depends on the deodorant.
[46:57.530 --> 47:00.410]  I've been trying to get away, I don't know if we talked about this here,
[47:00.470 --> 47:02.210]  I've been trying to not be an anti-perspirant guy
[47:02.210 --> 47:03.410]  and just being a deodorant guy.
[47:03.730 --> 47:05.970]  Yeah, cause you get Alzheimer's, right?
[47:06.410 --> 47:08.610]  Yeah, it's like, it's hard.
[47:10.110 --> 47:10.510]  It's...
[47:10.910 --> 47:12.590]  I can smell me sometimes
[47:12.590 --> 47:13.390]  and that's not good.
[47:13.990 --> 47:15.410]  It's like, it's tough.
[47:15.410 --> 47:18.250]  I feel like if you shower every day though, it's rarer.
[47:19.190 --> 47:19.550]  No.
[47:19.950 --> 47:21.370]  I agree with Geoff, no.
[47:21.370 --> 47:22.070]  Yeah, no.
[47:23.090 --> 47:25.310]  I've done the same thing for the exact same reasons,
[47:25.410 --> 47:27.570]  Eric, and it's really frustrating cause anti-perspirant
[47:27.570 --> 47:29.390]  deodorant is better deodorant
[47:29.390 --> 47:30.810]  than just deodorant.
[47:30.850 --> 47:32.790]  It absolutely is. It's weird.
[47:33.010 --> 47:35.470]  But I don't use it anymore either, I just use deodorant now as well
[47:35.470 --> 47:36.510]  cause I don't wanna die or whatnot.
[47:37.050 --> 47:38.570]  And yeah, it's fucking miserable.
[47:38.930 --> 47:39.710]  It really sucks.
[47:43.490 --> 47:45.430]  Is that a real thing or is that just something
[47:45.430 --> 47:46.930]  someone said once and everyone got scared?
[47:47.070 --> 47:49.390]  I think it's that. I mean, I don't
[47:49.390 --> 47:51.490]  know that it's actually real. It's like aluminum
[47:51.490 --> 47:52.250]  in it or something.
[47:53.610 --> 47:55.070]  It's a thing where like, I just
[47:55.070 --> 47:57.390]  it can't be healthy for
[47:57.390 --> 47:59.350]  you to put something on to make you
[47:59.350 --> 48:01.270]  stop sweating that much, right?
[48:01.930 --> 48:02.230]  Sure.
[48:02.970 --> 48:05.710]  It just can't be. So I'm just going like, I'll just do deodorant
[48:05.710 --> 48:07.470]  and then it just feels
[48:07.470 --> 48:09.370]  like a gamble. It's like, I wish I could carry
[48:09.370 --> 48:10.810]  deodorant with me and it wouldn't melt
[48:10.810 --> 48:12.410]  and I would be fine, but
[48:12.850 --> 48:14.930]  it ain't happening. You could carry a can.
[48:15.450 --> 48:16.770]  I don't think a can's gonna be...
[48:16.770 --> 48:18.390]  It'd have to be like a very small can.
[48:18.870 --> 48:20.730]  Yeah. I don't think spray
[48:20.730 --> 48:22.770]  works as well as roll-on. Me neither.
[48:22.890 --> 48:23.710]  It also makes me sticky.
[48:24.870 --> 48:26.670]  Oh, interesting. And plus with
[48:26.670 --> 48:28.650]  spray, you get over-spray.
[48:29.330 --> 48:31.010]  I've noticed that sometimes with like
[48:32.290 --> 48:32.990]  if you're using
[48:32.990 --> 48:34.730]  like, I don't know, a hairspray or
[48:34.730 --> 48:36.770]  something too close to a wall, you lean your arm
[48:36.770 --> 48:38.450]  up against the wall and you're like, why's it fucking sticky?
[48:38.870 --> 48:39.390]  Ah, right.
[48:41.210 --> 48:42.870]  I do want to keep talking
[48:42.870 --> 48:44.790]  about this. However, Geoff said that he's
[48:44.790 --> 48:46.390]  been waiting a month to tell us how he
[48:46.390 --> 48:48.630]  fakes himself. Oh, right.
[48:48.710 --> 48:50.010]  It's not like a huge thing or anything.
[48:50.650 --> 48:52.370]  But the pandemic kind of
[48:52.370 --> 48:54.330]  fucked up how I
[48:55.490 --> 48:56.590]  consume entertainment, right?
[48:56.890 --> 48:58.550]  And so before the pandemic,
[48:58.550 --> 49:00.450]  I read incessantly.
[49:00.810 --> 49:01.830]  I read...
[49:01.830 --> 49:04.670]  My kind of running goal in life
[49:04.670 --> 49:06.290]  was to read a book a week, every week.
[49:06.610 --> 49:08.790]  I did it for like a year and then I did it the next
[49:08.790 --> 49:10.430]  year and then I did it the next year and then I decided
[49:10.430 --> 49:12.110]  I'm just gonna read a book a week for the rest of my life.
[49:12.110 --> 49:14.190]  And so I was on that
[49:14.190 --> 49:15.770]  path and then the pandemic...
[49:15.770 --> 49:18.130]  I don't know what happened because suddenly we had all the
[49:18.130 --> 49:20.030]  time in the world and we were at home, but I
[49:20.030 --> 49:22.050]  just stopped reading and I couldn't force
[49:22.050 --> 49:24.190]  myself to read. I just couldn't
[49:24.190 --> 49:25.870]  fucking do it. I also stopped watching movies,
[49:26.070 --> 49:28.030]  which is why I've been trying to get back into movies
[49:28.030 --> 49:29.790]  this year, although I gotta be honest with you, I have...
[49:29.790 --> 49:32.050]  I watched like, what, five movies already this year? And I am taking
[49:32.050 --> 49:34.030]  a break. I'm on a movie hiatus. It's too much.
[49:34.270 --> 49:36.070]  It's too much movie. I switched
[49:36.070 --> 49:38.050]  to music. I even have a little bit prepared for
[49:38.050 --> 49:40.010]  that. I doubt we'll get to it. We can do it some other time.
[49:40.010 --> 49:41.930]  But I'm on a movie hiatus
[49:41.930 --> 49:43.270]  because it was just... ugh, God.
[49:44.470 --> 49:46.090]  But anyway, I was
[49:46.090 --> 49:47.870]  in the middle of reading a book that I was in
[49:47.870 --> 49:50.150]  love with, or I had just started a book that I was in love
[49:50.150 --> 49:52.090]  with by Franz Kafka
[49:52.090 --> 49:53.890]  called The Castle. And
[49:53.890 --> 49:55.970]  so I liked the world
[49:55.970 --> 49:58.070]  and it's a real thinker and so I liked
[49:58.070 --> 49:59.910]  like sitting and reading like five or six pages
[49:59.910 --> 50:01.810]  and then just kind of sitting with that
[50:01.810 --> 50:04.110]  for like a month or
[50:04.110 --> 50:05.910]  two. And I decided
[50:05.910 --> 50:07.890]  I'm just gonna take as long as feels natural
[50:07.890 --> 50:09.930]  to read this book. And so it took
[50:09.930 --> 50:11.770]  me about three years
[50:12.770 --> 50:13.090]  and
[50:13.810 --> 50:15.930]  it's not a long book. I was just... sometimes I'd
[50:15.930 --> 50:17.870]  go like two months without reading it and then I'd read a
[50:17.870 --> 50:19.590]  page. You know, just like whatever felt right.
[50:20.030 --> 50:21.610]  And then early this year,
[50:21.810 --> 50:23.030]  like around January, I thought
[50:23.630 --> 50:25.890]  this is taking too long. I gotta finish this fucking book and move on
[50:25.890 --> 50:27.850]  with my life. I gotta get past it. And so
[50:27.850 --> 50:29.810]  I sat down and I finished like the last third of the book
[50:30.970 --> 50:31.610]  to discover
[50:32.330 --> 50:33.770]  and I thought it's no big deal
[50:33.770 --> 50:35.770]  because I'm just gonna finish the book and I will
[50:35.770 --> 50:37.790]  have this... like it'll be a three year long
[50:37.790 --> 50:39.610]  story for me but I really
[50:40.350 --> 50:41.810]  digested this story
[50:41.810 --> 50:43.690]  and thought about this character Kay
[50:43.690 --> 50:45.930]  and all the scenarios and
[50:45.930 --> 50:47.410]  it's a fascinating
[50:47.410 --> 50:49.850]  fascinating complicated book
[50:49.850 --> 50:51.850]  and I finished this fucking book
[50:51.850 --> 50:53.290]  and I didn't realize
[50:53.290 --> 50:55.590]  that Kafka died before he
[50:55.590 --> 50:57.430]  finished it. So the book
[50:57.430 --> 50:59.390]  ends mid-sentence.
[50:59.630 --> 50:59.810]  No!
[51:00.950 --> 51:03.530]  The last sentence in the book is literally
[51:03.530 --> 51:05.530]  She held out her hand trembling
[51:05.530 --> 51:07.370]  She held out her trembling hand to Kay
[51:07.370 --> 51:09.110]  and had him sit down beside her
[51:09.110 --> 51:10.890]  She spoke with great difficulty
[51:11.690 --> 51:13.230]  Sorry, let me just take that again
[51:14.110 --> 51:15.290]  She held out her
[51:15.290 --> 51:17.090]  trembling hand to Kay
[51:17.090 --> 51:19.510]  I had to swallow
[51:19.510 --> 51:21.250]  She held out her trembling hand to Kay
[51:21.250 --> 51:23.190]  and had him sit down beside her
[51:23.190 --> 51:24.630]  She spoke with great difficulty
[51:24.630 --> 51:27.510]  It is hard to understand her, but what she
[51:27.510 --> 51:28.070]  said
[51:29.510 --> 51:30.030]  No!
[51:30.030 --> 51:32.210]  And that's where it ended!
[51:32.470 --> 51:33.970]  That's where he died!
[51:34.470 --> 51:34.710]  No!
[51:35.450 --> 51:37.170]  I spent three years
[51:37.850 --> 51:39.930]  taking my time to get the resolution
[51:39.930 --> 51:41.950]  of a story that I absolutely fucking
[51:41.950 --> 51:43.690]  loved, only to find out
[51:43.690 --> 51:46.090]  that he never finished it because he fucking
[51:46.090 --> 51:47.010]  died!
[51:47.410 --> 51:49.210]  That is the biggest
[51:49.930 --> 51:52.530]  most unsatisfying
[51:52.530 --> 51:53.750]  end to a thing I have ever
[51:53.750 --> 51:55.450]  experienced in my life!
[51:55.910 --> 51:57.990]  And it just happened to be the one book
[51:57.990 --> 51:59.590]  that you wanted to spend years reading
[51:59.590 --> 52:01.950]  That's unbelievable! I didn't even want to
[52:01.950 --> 52:03.890]  spend years reading, it just kind of worked out that way
[52:03.890 --> 52:05.890]  because like, fucking, the pandemic
[52:05.890 --> 52:07.610]  broke my ability to read or whatever
[52:07.610 --> 52:09.890]  and I thought, fine, I'm enjoying
[52:09.890 --> 52:12.270]  this, why force it? Why push it?
[52:12.430 --> 52:13.950]  Let me enjoy it at this new pace
[52:13.950 --> 52:15.370]  Maybe this is just how I read now
[52:15.370 --> 52:17.370]  And by the way, I've read like two books since then
[52:17.370 --> 52:19.150]  since I finished this fucking Kafka book
[52:19.150 --> 52:22.010]  But god damn dude, you know how fucking
[52:23.430 --> 52:24.070]  That's like
[52:24.070 --> 52:26.230]  jacking off for three straight years
[52:26.230 --> 52:27.710]  and then deciding not to jizz
[52:27.710 --> 52:29.650]  It is such a waste!
[52:30.090 --> 52:31.450]  Oh, it's brutal!
[52:31.950 --> 52:34.250]  Do you think that's the bluest your balls have ever been?
[52:34.370 --> 52:36.210]  It is the hardest anybody
[52:36.210 --> 52:37.850]  has ever edged in their life
[52:39.210 --> 52:40.090]  So wait, so
[52:40.090 --> 52:42.210]  is there like a disclaimer saying that he died
[52:42.210 --> 52:44.190]  there, or is it just... Oh, it's all over
[52:44.190 --> 52:45.710]  the internet if you read about it, yeah
[52:45.710 --> 52:47.970]  I didn't do any research on the book
[52:47.970 --> 52:49.810]  No, I don't think so, it just starts when you read it
[52:49.810 --> 52:52.250]  How do you, like, not finish the
[52:52.250 --> 52:52.750]  sentence?
[52:53.410 --> 52:53.770]  Oh!
[52:54.630 --> 52:56.630]  Did he die with the pen in his hand?
[52:57.030 --> 52:58.110]  I read about it afterward
[52:58.910 --> 53:00.730]  and he was close to death when he
[53:00.730 --> 53:02.630]  was writing it and he was in failing health
[53:02.630 --> 53:04.570]  and the book was, he could
[53:04.570 --> 53:06.230]  the book was stressing him out
[53:06.670 --> 53:08.190]  and he couldn't, he decided, he quit
[53:08.610 --> 53:10.810]  he decided he just couldn't fucking, it was too
[53:10.810 --> 53:12.810]  much for him, and then he died
[53:12.810 --> 53:14.750]  before he got healthy enough to finish it
[53:14.750 --> 53:16.110]  or figure out the problem
[53:16.110 --> 53:18.710]  and so I just, for the rest of my life, I don't get to know
[53:18.710 --> 53:20.310]  if he ever got to the god damn castle or not
[53:20.310 --> 53:22.890]  I'm guessing not, but I would love to have known
[53:23.450 --> 53:24.370]  How, like
[53:24.370 --> 53:26.410]  within the context of the story, it's
[53:26.410 --> 53:27.310]  pretty far into the book?
[53:27.930 --> 53:29.990]  Yeah, it's near the end, like he got right to the end
[53:29.990 --> 53:32.470]  One would assume it's pretty near the end
[53:32.470 --> 53:33.090]  Wow
[53:33.090 --> 53:36.210]  I would say it's definitely, it's somewhere between 65
[53:37.070 --> 53:38.310]  and 95%
[53:38.310 --> 53:40.330]  of the way through the story, like you don't really know
[53:40.330 --> 53:40.970]  Oh shit
[53:40.970 --> 53:43.050]  But you get the impression, yeah
[53:43.050 --> 53:44.810]  Yeah, frankly my dear, dead
[53:44.810 --> 53:45.650]  That's what it is
[53:45.650 --> 53:46.390]  laughter
[53:48.490 --> 53:49.690]  Yeah, I wonder what the
[53:49.690 --> 53:51.850]  worst sentence would be to end halfway through
[53:51.850 --> 53:53.470]  Oh my god
[53:54.910 --> 53:55.630]  laughter
[53:55.630 --> 53:56.590]  laughter
[53:59.080 --> 54:01.380]  I'd be like, and the paternity test
[54:01.380 --> 54:01.820]  reveals
[54:03.400 --> 54:04.840]  So anyway
[54:05.120 --> 54:07.460]  I fucked myself slowly over
[54:07.460 --> 54:08.500]  three years with this
[54:09.400 --> 54:09.860]  That's definitely
[54:10.580 --> 54:13.460]  my current biggest, most frustrating f***face
[54:13.460 --> 54:15.340]  What was the experience
[54:15.340 --> 54:17.580]  of, in the moment when that happened
[54:17.580 --> 54:19.220]  Like you, it just stopped
[54:20.500 --> 54:21.420]  Did you think there was
[54:21.420 --> 54:23.000]  an issue with the book? Disbelief
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.240]  No, I knew, I knew instantly
[54:25.240 --> 54:27.080]  what happened, utter disbelief
[54:27.080 --> 54:28.860]  And I just sat there
[54:28.860 --> 54:31.220]  I thought about it for a while, I was
[54:31.220 --> 54:33.080]  bummed dude, I can just imagine you
[54:33.080 --> 54:35.500]  closing the last page and like looking behind it
[54:35.500 --> 54:36.780]  and shutting the book and being like
[54:36.780 --> 54:39.280]  You surely got me, and they stuck together
[54:39.280 --> 54:41.440]  Yeah, I was at a coffee shop and I just
[54:41.440 --> 54:43.240]  like put the book down and I just f***ing was bummed
[54:43.240 --> 54:44.680]  I just went to my phone and started reading
[54:45.040 --> 54:46.420]  about what the f*** was going on
[54:47.600 --> 54:49.220]  Yeah, it'd be really, really
[54:49.220 --> 54:51.300]  slow and rare, but I would love to see
[54:51.300 --> 54:53.360]  a compilation of people finishing that book
[54:53.360 --> 54:55.000]  Yeah, like not knowing that
[54:55.000 --> 54:55.840]  that's what happened
[54:59.280 --> 55:01.500]  It's a really good story
[55:01.500 --> 55:02.940]  too, if you like
[55:02.940 --> 55:05.240]  if you like slow, ponderous
[55:05.240 --> 55:07.460]  things, but god damn
[55:07.460 --> 55:09.360]  Yeah, don't go into it looking for a resolution
[55:09.360 --> 55:10.760]  because you won't f***ing get it
[55:10.760 --> 55:12.740]  Although I don't, I don't think
[55:12.740 --> 55:14.960]  I think the point of the book is that there wouldn't have been a resolution
[55:14.960 --> 55:16.340]  to his problem anyway
[55:16.340 --> 55:18.580]  It's kind of, the whole book is about like bureaucracy
[55:18.580 --> 55:19.420]  and red tape
[55:20.580 --> 55:22.160]  but, I mean, that's like
[55:22.160 --> 55:24.480]  it was just too, it was just ridiculous
[55:24.480 --> 55:26.900]  Should we end our cookbook bit sentence?
[55:28.120 --> 55:28.840]  I got some other
[55:28.840 --> 55:29.680]  ideas for a cookbook
[55:30.320 --> 55:32.740]  Oh, I want to play a game with you guys actually
[55:32.740 --> 55:34.600]  but I haven't quite worked it out yet, but it's
[55:34.600 --> 55:36.560]  it's to create, I want to create
[55:37.500 --> 55:39.180]  I want to create two things for the cookbook
[55:39.180 --> 55:41.260]  I want to create a Mad Lib for the cookbook
[55:41.260 --> 55:43.340]  so that you can kind of like create your own
[55:43.340 --> 55:45.300]  recipe, and then I want
[55:45.300 --> 55:47.320]  to bundle together a bunch
[55:47.320 --> 55:48.380]  of ingredients
[55:49.180 --> 55:50.940]  that I have you guys get
[55:50.940 --> 55:52.780]  and then it's like a word
[55:53.380 --> 55:55.300]  jumble, and you can like, you try to make
[55:55.300 --> 55:56.940]  your own recipe from the
[55:56.940 --> 55:58.920]  ingredients that we give you, and it's like
[55:58.920 --> 56:00.440]  what can you make with these ingredients?
[56:01.400 --> 56:03.200]  But I haven't, I've started to like
[56:03.200 --> 56:04.800]  segment it out, but I want to make sure I do it
[56:04.800 --> 56:07.200]  I cover all the bases, so that you can build
[56:07.200 --> 56:09.200]  a complete meal out of it, yeah. Do we have pictures?
[56:09.200 --> 56:11.400]  We'll do that later. Uh, not yet, we will
[56:11.760 --> 56:13.200]  Have you seen the book yet, Geoff?
[56:13.680 --> 56:15.320]  No. Uh, I can send
[56:15.320 --> 56:16.780]  it to you. It's uh, there's some
[56:17.180 --> 56:19.260]  art in it right now, some drawings
[56:19.820 --> 56:20.700]  Oh, okay. But
[56:21.220 --> 56:22.660]  there will be, I'm gonna
[56:23.200 --> 56:25.240]  personally gonna do the photography for it
[56:25.240 --> 56:27.240]  Oh, that's great. Oh wow, that's so
[56:27.240 --> 56:29.720]  great. I'm very excited. Are you gonna do it like
[56:29.720 --> 56:31.200]  old Geoff or new Geoff?
[56:31.560 --> 56:33.480]  I've been buying backdrops off Amazon
[56:33.480 --> 56:35.240]  and stuff, I'm gonna do it really well
[56:35.240 --> 56:36.420]  I have some very
[56:37.720 --> 56:39.300]  very strong opinions on how
[56:39.300 --> 56:41.020]  I want to do the, how the photography to look
[56:41.020 --> 56:43.080]  so I've decided I'm just gonna do it. I might incorporate
[56:43.080 --> 56:44.740]  Wes' help a little bit or somebody else, but yeah
[56:44.740 --> 56:47.320]  I'm gonna try to tackle it myself
[56:47.320 --> 56:49.220]  Have you looked at any other
[56:49.220 --> 56:51.240]  non-chef cookbooks to see how
[56:51.240 --> 56:52.960]  we compete at all? Any
[56:52.960 --> 56:55.140]  worry of intimidation? No
[56:55.140 --> 56:57.380]  I don't want to be influenced by other people's bullshit
[56:57.780 --> 56:59.160]  That's fair, I'm just, you know
[56:59.160 --> 57:01.160]  we're in a tough market, we gotta go
[57:01.160 --> 57:03.140]  up against the like Boston Rob
[57:03.140 --> 57:05.140]  Cookbook, I'm trying to think of other people that
[57:05.140 --> 57:07.240]  aren't chefs. The Star Wars cookbook, stuff like that
[57:07.240 --> 57:09.240]  I have supreme confidence
[57:09.240 --> 57:11.160]  in what we're creating. If anything, I'm
[57:11.160 --> 57:13.120]  a little too confident. I
[57:13.120 --> 57:15.240]  like it. Is there a scrumping section
[57:15.240 --> 57:16.760]  like if you have an excess of apples?
[57:17.720 --> 57:18.020]  No
[57:19.180 --> 57:21.200]  No, but, and I'll say this
[57:21.200 --> 57:22.960]  feel free to write anything
[57:22.960 --> 57:25.000]  you want to add into the cookbook, it's not
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.200]  too late, like, we got pages
[57:27.200 --> 57:29.280]  and pages we can fill, like it's about 40 pages
[57:29.280 --> 57:31.360]  right now, but it could be whatever we want it to be
[57:31.360 --> 57:32.960]  It's pretty good for a cookbook
[57:32.960 --> 57:34.700]  Yeah, it's not bad. For at least our cookbook
[57:34.700 --> 57:37.580]  For us not being qualified at all to make a cookbook
[57:37.580 --> 57:39.260]  it's pretty good. Yeah, I agree
[57:39.260 --> 57:41.140]  And it's all stuff from the show, I mean
[57:41.140 --> 57:43.280]  I made, the only thing that's not in
[57:43.280 --> 57:45.220]  the episodes is
[57:45.840 --> 57:46.240]  NickNotNick's
[57:47.600 --> 57:49.220]  recipe that you did, NickNot
[57:49.900 --> 57:50.720]  NickNotThatNick or whatever
[57:50.720 --> 57:52.860]  and then I went ahead and
[57:54.640 --> 57:55.440]  I don't know, do you
[57:55.440 --> 57:57.020]  want to explain that, Andrew? Sure
[57:57.020 --> 57:59.260]  My grandpa's name was Nick
[57:59.260 --> 58:01.300]  and he had a family recipe that we used all the
[58:01.300 --> 58:03.480]  time called Nick's Chicken, so I submitted
[58:03.480 --> 58:05.120]  it as NickNotThatNick's Chicken
[58:07.120 --> 58:07.500]  Okay
[58:08.440 --> 58:09.480]  I don't know what was
[58:09.480 --> 58:10.860]  going on. And then I
[58:10.860 --> 58:13.060]  went ahead and created a recipe for
[58:13.060 --> 58:15.340]  boiled peanuts, just because I talk about it all the time
[58:15.340 --> 58:16.920]  so I figured I'd throw that in as an extra
[58:16.920 --> 58:19.260]  Everything else is something
[58:19.260 --> 58:21.240]  that has been on the show or we've made
[58:21.240 --> 58:22.800]  on the show, so far
[58:23.340 --> 58:25.320]  I'm excited, I like the idea of trying to put
[58:25.320 --> 58:27.140]  together something if you just give us a bunch of
[58:27.140 --> 58:29.320]  ingredients. As somebody who, I'm a big recipe guy
[58:29.320 --> 58:30.520]  I think
[58:31.100 --> 58:33.060]  whatever I made was a monstrosity
[58:33.060 --> 58:35.160]  to be completely honest, whatever you threw
[58:35.160 --> 58:37.300]  together. Also reminds me of a
[58:37.300 --> 58:38.320]  kid's show
[58:38.960 --> 58:41.200]  which would have been like, I don't remember
[58:41.200 --> 58:43.200]  this may have been a Canadian thing, if somebody remembers this
[58:43.200 --> 58:44.640]  I'd love to know what it was called
[58:44.640 --> 58:46.880]  There was a kid's show where like, it was on YTV
[58:46.880 --> 58:49.060]  and there'd be all these like balls and nets
[58:49.060 --> 58:51.180]  and stuff and the kids had to grab as many
[58:51.180 --> 58:53.080]  items as they could and then create a game
[58:53.080 --> 58:54.760]  out of the stuff they grabbed
[58:54.760 --> 58:56.980]  and then they'd pick like, what the best game
[58:56.980 --> 58:58.820]  was, and I think the idea was like, you at home
[58:58.820 --> 59:00.940]  would then grab those items and then recreate the game
[59:00.940 --> 59:02.940]  if you wanted to. I like a food
[59:02.940 --> 59:03.680]  version of this.
[59:04.680 --> 59:05.880]  That's a really cool idea
[59:06.780 --> 59:08.540]  It's gonna be terrible, whatever I make
[59:08.540 --> 59:10.820]  What about, do you feel confident Gavin, if you just got a bunch
[59:10.820 --> 59:12.400]  of ingredients that you could make something good?
[59:12.940 --> 59:14.420]  Um, I mean are they gonna be like
[59:15.160 --> 59:15.880]  complementary ingredients?
[59:16.640 --> 59:18.800]  It's literally gonna be like, the way I'm gonna do it
[59:18.800 --> 59:20.760]  is I'm gonna go, okay guys, let's build this out
[59:20.760 --> 59:22.860]  Uh, Andrew, name a cooking
[59:22.860 --> 59:24.960]  method. Gavin, name a spice
[59:25.460 --> 59:26.800]  Eric, name a sauce
[59:26.800 --> 59:28.980]  So it's gonna be a shit show. Nick, name a starch
[59:28.980 --> 59:30.880]  Oh, it's gonna be so bad. Yeah, and then we'll just throw it
[59:30.880 --> 59:32.680]  all together. I like activities, I feel like
[59:33.060 --> 59:34.960]  books should have activities, like it could be rice
[59:34.960 --> 59:36.920]  could be potatoes, could be new potatoes, could be sweet
[59:36.920 --> 59:39.220]  potatoes, you know, it's like, there's a lot of options
[59:39.220 --> 59:40.900]  That sounds great. Uh, no
[59:40.900 --> 59:42.980]  I don't have confidence that I could make anything good
[59:42.980 --> 59:44.860]  I feel like us doing the condiments just
[59:44.860 --> 59:46.960]  has like, made my confidence even less
[59:46.960 --> 59:48.880]  like, that was an attempt of thinking
[59:48.880 --> 59:51.020]  I thought I knew how to do something, it was terrible
[59:51.560 --> 59:52.720]  It's gonna be a disaster
[59:53.200 --> 59:54.240]  Nick's was great, though
[59:54.240 --> 59:57.020]  It was. Look for this disaster in
[59:57.020 --> 59:59.040]  I believe the holidays is when we're trying to get
[59:59.040 --> 59:59.840]  this cookbook out by
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:03.060]  You think anyone has accidentally
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:05.000]  killed somebody, and they
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.780]  don't know it? Oh, definitely
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:09.160]  Like in their sleep, like did something in their
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.240]  sleep. Oh, in their sleep?
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.480]  Like sleepwalking?
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.100]  Like a sleepwalking thing, yeah, I don't know
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:17.060]  like, let's say, I was thinking
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.120]  about like, if somebody's walking around today
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.140]  that killed someone, but they
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.500]  have no concept that they did it. Like, accidentally
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:24.420]  Like,
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.440]  mixed up ingredients
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.140]  in something, and then left, and then
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:30.960]  the person drank it, and then they died
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.060]  and nobody figured out how they died
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.160]  or why. Yeah, but I guess also like, then
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.240]  not having an awareness of, I was thinking
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.080]  like in a tower, like let's say there's a
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.080]  tower guard, right, and he's sleeping
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.100]  and then he knocked over like a
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.020]  baseball or something, and it
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.100]  fell and it hit a bird, and then that bird hit a
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.700]  car, and then that car hit somebody.
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.520]  You never trace that to you.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.860]  Just the premise of, if
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:55.000]  there's somebody, the idea that you could somehow
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.800]  kill somebody and have no concept of it
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.360]  is very odd. It's like a murderous
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.580]  butterfly effect. Sort of, yeah.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.220]  Like you bump into somebody
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:05.020]  and then they drop their stuff
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.940]  but you're in a hurry so you keep running
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:08.900]  and then while they're picking up all their stuff
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:10.720]  somebody comes by, because they're
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.840]  doesn't see them and like runs over their head or something.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.220]  That has to have happened
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:17.220]  with someone. I bet it happens every day.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.200]  You think every day you think it's that
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.040]  common? It's crazy.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:21.980]  People are fragile.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.300]  I think playing... I was thinking about it
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.200]  with Sherlock Holmes, I think, of like trying to solve
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.120]  a case of like, the idea of capturing
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.180]  or like arresting someone that had no idea
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.180]  that they did what they did.
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.240]  It just is such a strange...
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.300]  or just like being told, like that's such
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.720]  a consequential thing. Anyway.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.080]  I remember sort of coming down a steep hill
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.660]  it was like a rocky
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.060]  almost like a cliff thing and it was like a bunch of
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.660]  loose slate and I just
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.840]  started a huge
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.040]  rock slide by accident and I was like
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.100]  slipping down and I had to like dive to the side
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.220]  and a bunch of slate went over the edge and I was like
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:59.180]  shit, if someone was walking below that
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:00.540]  they would definitely die.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:01.900]  Oh my god!
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.340]  But yeah, it was just, there was nothing below it.
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:06.900]  Alright, how about this?
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.180]  In a percentage of 0 to 100, what is
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.940]  the percentage chance, Andrew,
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:12.880]  that you have already killed somebody
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.300]  and you just don't know it? Do you think?
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:15.820]  Just go through your life.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.080]  Very low, I'd say.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.240]  Well, we've got the skittles. The stolen skittles.
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:24.860]  The skittles?
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:26.100]  What was it? Was it skittles?
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.020]  Stolen candy?
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.840]  Yeah, I think it was like an arrow bar.
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:33.080]  No, you had candy
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.480]  on your...
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:35.760]  that somebody stole from you.
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:38.700]  I thought you meant when I ran out of the store
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.900]  with the thing. I talked about that recently.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.120]  Not the skittles.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.840]  I shot, there was a thing
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.660]  where we had, you know like those potato
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.660]  cannon things? Yeah.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.860]  We had one of those, and I
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.780]  used to live in a place that had like a hill
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.840]  and you couldn't see over the hill, it went to like
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.000]  the forest type thing, and we were shooting
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.860]  it, and I shot it
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.600]  and it hit, it sounded like it hit
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.380]  like a deer, so it was like...
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.080]  and then we stopped, we stopped doing it
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.240]  but I think that was an animal, and I don't think that animal
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.020]  died, but I think I hit an animal
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.240]  with a potato once, that's probably
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.180]  the closest. Imagine finding
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:17.420]  a deer with like a supersonic
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.240]  potato lodged in its ribcage.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.700]  I think so, it was like you
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.360]  shoot hairspray into this pipe
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.020]  and then it would launch somehow.
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:27.280]  I was very little when this happened, I don't really remember
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:27.820]  the specifics.
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:30.880]  Man, you just reminded me of a fucking...
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:31.880]  oh boy.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.220]  You remind me of a story from
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.180]  from high school, I haven't
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.160]  thought about since for a very long time.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.100]  Oh yes, what did you do?
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.600]  Oh man, there was this kid on my street
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.000]  who got a .22 for Christmas
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.980]  you know, I grew up in Alabama
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:48.200]  a lot, well most
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.040]  Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, so
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.480]  deep south. People always talk about .22
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.220]  like it's like a BB gun or something
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:56.060]  it's a full blown gun.
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.020]  Yeah, I wasn't
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.020]  referring to it as a BB gun at all
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:01.780]  I was referring to it as a .22
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:03.960]  People are like, oh when I was a kid
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.680]  I had a little .22, it's a firearm.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:07.700]  Fucking kids in Alabama
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.160]  get guns at like 4.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.480]  It's a part of your
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.840]  childhood, dude.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.100]  So anyway, one of the kids
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:17.600]  on my street when I was maybe 9th grade
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.420]  got a .22 for Christmas
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.600]  and he
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.780]  invited me and two other
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:25.060]  kids over to shoot it with him
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:27.080]  and he just put up a bunch of
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.880]  Coke cans or beer cans
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.660]  or something on the fence in his
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.400]  backyard and he lived
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.340]  his backyard backed up into the woods
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:37.720]  and we used to play in these woods, we used to run around
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.800]  we used to build forts in these woods
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.160]  deep, deep woods
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:43.720]  but I didn't know this
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:44.840]  I know this now
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.560]  a .22 round
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.400]  travels pretty fucking far
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.740]  and so we were
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.700]  just shooting cans and then I went
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.700]  home and I think he and the other kids kept shooting
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:56.120]  cans
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:58.260]  and
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.140]  the next
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.540]  or later that night actually
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.900]  a fucking cop knocked on my front door
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:05.760]  and I answered the door
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:08.140]  and I was like, my mom and I answered the door
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:09.880]  and I was like, yes sir, and he goes, were you
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.140]  at so and so's house earlier today
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.340]  and I was like, yes, and he goes, were you shooting a .22
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:15.040]  and I was like,
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.200]  yeah, I'm sorry, is that a problem?
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.620]  We were just shooting cans in the backyard
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:20.980]  and he's like,
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.560]  don't do that again. And I was like,
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:25.060]  okay, well,
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.620]  I was like, it's not my gun, I barely shot it
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.440]  I only shot it like three times
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.700]  I'm not a big gun guy, they were way more
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.460]  into it, why? And he goes, there's an apartment
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.280]  complex on the other side of those woods, you idiot
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.940]  and you guys shot up
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.140]  an apartment complex
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:40.860]  Oh my god
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:43.480]  How did it take us
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.580]  154 episodes to get
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.460]  to I shot up an apartment complex
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.240]  Oh my god
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.940]  I don't know, I guess it never came up
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:53.160]  Holy shit
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.460]  Nobody was injured
[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.140]  and I did not get in trouble
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:59.880]  The cop just said, be
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.980]  safer next time and that was all I
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:03.020]  ever heard of it again
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.160]  Good lord
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.740]  And that kid who got the .22 for Christmas
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:10.040]  he didn't have a dad or anything so he didn't get in trouble
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.100]  either, his mom didn't care
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.060]  She just told him not to do it again
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:15.560]  and so he started
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:17.640]  what he did was he started
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.620]  putting the cans on the ground
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:20.480]  and shooting them
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.600]  So he started shooting down
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.100]  but yeah, uh
[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.220]  Holy fuck
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:29.740]  Any one of us could have very clearly ended somebody else's and our
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.720]  lives and that's
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:33.840]  why, one of the main reasons
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.160]  I don't fucking like guns
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.660]  because even if you think, even if you're a dumb kid
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.620]  but you think you're being safe, shooting into
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:41.580]  deep woods that you know very well
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.500]  because you spent your entire childhood
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:45.600]  traipsing back there and you know nobody
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.040]  else on earth is back in those woods
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.900]  and they go forever
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.360]  you'd be surprised
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:53.000]  I think that's what's scary about it to me is that the
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.920]  what you had happen, which is
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.340]  a cop knocks on your door and then you continue living your life
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:58.800]  and spending
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.860]  25 years in prison
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:02.860]  feel like the exact same thing
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:03.920]  when you're doing it
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.040]  what you experienced would have been the same
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.140]  in both results
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.920]  whether you killed someone or the fact that you didn't
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.500]  it's just so scary to think about
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.140]  Also, can you imagine
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:16.740]  in 2023
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.120]  a couple of teenage kids doing that
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.260]  and not getting in trouble
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:21.460]  No
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.140]  I'd love to know the extent of the damage
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.600]  like where did the bullets go
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:29.280]  would somebody in their living room
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.020]  and then bullets just start whizzing
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.180]  I don't think it was
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.240]  I think it was maybe like one or two bullets
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.320]  hit the outside of an apartment complex or something
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.280]  Nobody was injured
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.280]  the cop, like I said, the guy didn't even
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.280]  yell at me really, he was just like, be more careful
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.520]  you know, and my mom was like
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.900]  holy shit, stay away from guns
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:49.180]  and I was like, yeah, of course
[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:51.620]  and then I had the incident where the shotgun went off on my hands
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:53.280]  in my living room, or in my bedroom
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.680]  I think I've told you guys that story before
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:57.760]  and I fucking hate guns
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.320]  and then I joined the army
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.540]  and hated guns in the army
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:04.460]  That's insane
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:06.380]  That's such an American upbringing
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.580]  Like you said
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.360]  What episode is this? 154?
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:12.680]  154?
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:15.020]  154
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:17.180]  The fact it took us 154 episodes
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:17.980]  to get to that
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:21.620]  Do you think if somebody who lived in that apartment building had a podcast
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.420]  it would take them 154 episodes
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:25.320]  to get the reverse side of that story?
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.940]  No, that'd be episode one
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:28.560]  Yeah, yeah, my apartment complex
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.260]  I walked outside my apartment complex
[01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:32.420]  and was just getting shot up out of nowhere
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:34.940]  It's like
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.520]  Age and perspective are fucking terrible
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.360]  Because if I would've told that story
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.500]  10 years ago, I would've felt differently about it
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.020]  If I told it 20 years ago, I would've felt very differently about it
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.980]  Now, I want to throw up
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:48.920]  telling the story
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.260]  It's so upsetting to me
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.640]  At 47
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.560]  I can draw out the line
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.920]  and see the real consequences
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.760]  and think about how differently my life could've gone
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.440]  How differently some poor, innocent person's life
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.000]  could've gone
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:06.620]  It makes me not want to look back
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:08.140]  anymore
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:11.040]  Because you often land on something
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.260]  and you're like, oh, fuck
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:15.380]  I feel very differently about that memory now
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.680]  That must happen more and more
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.560]  to people who live really long lives
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.280]  People who are like 95
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.800]  must be like, wow, I really magooed my way
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:23.480]  through this somehow
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.880]  How did nothing happen?
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.740]  So I'd say the chance that I killed
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:30.520]  somebody unintentionally in the past is
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:31.560]  like 50-50
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.040]  Wow
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:33.620]  Jesus
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:36.900]  Just because I grew up doing dumb shit in the south
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.740]  where it was expected
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:39.620]  and encouraged
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:42.740]  That's fair
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:44.560]  What an episode
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.360]  Love it
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.680]  Profound. Cars
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.020]  Our sunset seasons
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.520]  We're about to take a huge break
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:54.260]  We are! Two weeks, right?
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:56.000]  Yeah, we're taking two weeks off
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.060]  I'll miss you guys terribly
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.100]  There's going to be a lot of morning thoughts
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:01.120]  when you come back
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:03.480]  I'm going to have my back measured
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.780]  Oh, you still didn't measure your back?
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.640]  We went right into the second
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.600]  I was going to do it between episodes, but we went right into it
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.140]  Do it now!
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.760]  I can't do it, I don't trust it now
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:15.220]  What do you mean? It can't be more wrong than Eric
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.620]  Nah, I've got the longest back
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:20.480]  Thank you guys so much for listening to episode 154
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.040]  of the F*** Face Podcast
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.020]  I have the longest back
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:25.140]  and that's very important
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.260]  I've seen my long, long back at RTX
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.620]  July 7th through 9th
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:30.340]  RTXAustin.com to get your tickets
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:34.220]  You can see my long, long back
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:34.980]  in other oddities
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.380]  at the F*** Face Museum
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.840]  Buy a Falcon sign
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.820]  Yeah
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.600]  That's probably out, right?
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:42.940]  Yeah, probably
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:49.660]  That Slack channel
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:50.700]  gives me a f***ing headache
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:53.180]  I can't spend too much time
[01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:54.880]  in the F*** Face merch Slack channel
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.720]  It makes me sick
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.580]  Why is that?
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:00.280]  Because it's just numbers and images
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.560]  It feels like a fever dream
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.180]  It's just faces
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.480]  stretched and sprawled
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.700]  with dates that feel never-ending
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.380]  It is... I can't
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.220]  It's like a
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.060]  collection of dangling
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:15.580]  bits
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:16.500]  Yeah
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.820]  Speaking of, we got a pretty f***ing cool shirt
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:21.840]  Tony just designed
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.980]  Oh yeah, we got some good stuff coming
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:25.600]  Can we start a calendar
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.880]  that's our release schedule and we can see
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.860]  make it easier to see which
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:32.160]  weeks have gaps that we can throw at a condo man
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.820]  or a draft or some s***
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.940]  Because I feel like we just sit on stuff
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:36.940]  and then we have empty weeks
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:40.040]  I bet that schedule exists
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.640]  and we just don't look at it
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.340]  Oh, it absolutely doesn't
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:45.500]  It's just me and Nick going
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.020]  OK, what thing is done
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.040]  where can this go so it's not stepping on other stuff
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.120]  and then we work with Brendan
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.600]  Someone was saying that all of
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.040]  the YouTube content helped
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.940]  one of the episodes or some s***
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:00.840]  You see that, Geoff? Hannah was talking about it
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.280]  It was posted in the AH channel
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.840]  Are we still...
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.720]  Is this still the episode?
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.620]  Wait, did we wrap?
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:08.840]  Yeah, didn't we?
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.280]  Hey, thanks for listening
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.800]  We'll see you guys next week
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.440]  Be sure to watch the videos on YouTube
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.740]  It helps the podcast apparently
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.480]  Yeah, let Hannah know that you're watching
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.180]  these videos on YouTube, it helps
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:23.960]  They really are good
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.740]  We'd really appreciate it
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.660]  Thanks, OK, bye
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:30.840]  Was that recorded? That was the episode?
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.180]  Yes! Of course
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:33.740]  Did you f***ing hit stop?
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.100]  In my brain, I did
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.020]  OK, so the answer's no?
[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:39.420]  Yeah, no
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.560]  OK, alright, in
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.460]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:49.020]  with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.740]  The backlinks are back
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:52.200]  It's animated Andrew
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.000]  Gavin enters the simulation
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.280]  The boys are moving to the Conk Republic
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.060]  Corridor beat us to the punch
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:00.440]  Who won the draft? And once again
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.020]  Andrew does not eat the pencil
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:05.180]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face
