[00:10.280 --> 00:14.300]  I could see, like, a bobcat being, like, a lanky guy that knows jiu-jitsu.
[00:14.620 --> 00:17.400]  Like, you might be surprised once you get into the fight.
[00:17.540 --> 00:21.480]  Like, it might be, like, holy shit, this is a problem that I did not anticipate.
[00:21.980 --> 00:24.640]  Where a cougar is more direct in their threat, I would say.
[00:25.020 --> 00:27.820]  Yeah. Yeah, distinct, distinct, yeah, sure. Why not?
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.480]  Bobcat? Too small. Right?
[00:30.560 --> 00:31.860]  Yeah, right? It's not intimidating.
[00:32.540 --> 00:37.020]  Like, that's a middle school, that's a middle school, uh, fuckin' mascot, right?
[00:37.020 --> 00:39.780]  It fits the size of a 7th grader.
[00:39.780 --> 00:40.460]  Yeah, it is.
[00:42.720 --> 00:46.860]  Wow! The bobcat, male bobcat, 14 to 40 pounds.
[00:47.400 --> 00:51.140]  Female bobcat, 8.8 to 34. That's nothin'.
[00:51.140 --> 00:52.700]  That's nothin'. Henry was bigger than that.
[00:52.880 --> 00:56.760]  That's what I'm sayin'. Like, you could, I could pick up and throw a bobcat like a football.
[00:57.380 --> 00:59.820]  Yeah, you could yeet a bobcat. Yeet yeetin' a cougar.
[01:00.940 --> 01:04.440]  The branding of the bobcat really was hurt by Bobcat Gold Wave, as well.
[01:04.440 --> 01:10.900]  Like, I associate, there's nothing intimidating about that man, and that's the number one bobcat association I have.
[01:11.160 --> 01:15.980]  Yeah, he should change his name to Robert Cat, and then he could be Robert Cat Goldthwait.
[01:16.180 --> 01:22.560]  But, um, guys, we're back after a long break. Last time, we talked about, uh, What is Weather?
[01:22.900 --> 01:24.920]  And There's Money in the Leaf Game was the title.
[01:25.280 --> 01:28.500]  Uh, we talked about, uh, Flintstoning it.
[01:28.760 --> 01:32.100]  We talked about, uh, we saw Stuart the Bumbling customer footage.
[01:32.640 --> 01:36.920]  Um, Geoff had waking thoughts. There was a hot dog issue.
[01:37.460 --> 01:38.660]  The F*** Face Museum.
[01:39.440 --> 01:41.340]  Uh, Icy Hot While Needing to Pee.
[01:41.840 --> 01:43.200]  Deodorant. Uh, cookbooks.
[01:43.520 --> 01:44.920]  Accidental murder in a 22.
[01:45.380 --> 01:48.660]  But that was all the previous episode. Uh, this is 155.
[01:49.080 --> 01:51.860]  I got some more stuff, too. I got some stuff to clean up.
[01:51.900 --> 01:57.360]  Can I just say, before this, before this episode starts, if Andrew hasn't measured his back, I'm gonna be livid.
[01:57.740 --> 01:59.700]  Oh! Oh, don't you worry.
[02:00.420 --> 02:01.920]  Don't you worry.
[02:02.200 --> 02:04.040]  Should we start the episode?
[02:04.420 --> 02:04.960]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:05.020 --> 02:06.460]  Okay, hold on a second.
[02:06.820 --> 02:07.360]  Heh, heh, heh.
[02:08.200 --> 02:11.220]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[02:11.480 --> 02:13.240]  My name is T-Bone Ramsey.
[02:13.480 --> 02:16.600]  And with me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[02:17.000 --> 02:18.680]  Episode 155.
[02:19.040 --> 02:21.820]  Little quick, uh, let's check in on everybody health-wise.
[02:22.020 --> 02:23.020]  Uh, Gavin, how you doing?
[02:23.520 --> 02:24.100]  Pretty good.
[02:24.540 --> 02:25.300]  Good, good to know.
[02:25.440 --> 02:26.460]  Nick, how you doing?
[02:27.020 --> 02:27.540]  All good.
[02:28.240 --> 02:29.360]  All right, that's good to know.
[02:29.440 --> 02:31.480]  Eric, I'm a little concerned about you. How are you feeling?
[02:32.200 --> 02:34.420]  So far, Geoff, so good.
[02:34.840 --> 02:36.920]  Okay, that's, that's, uh, that's quite a relief.
[02:37.060 --> 02:38.020]  Andrew, how are you doing?
[02:38.460 --> 02:39.760]  I have COVID, but I'm good.
[02:40.880 --> 02:41.340]  How about you, Geoff?
[02:41.340 --> 02:43.500]  Uh, somebody, somebody asked me how I'm doing?
[02:43.820 --> 02:45.380]  I have COVID, but I'm good.
[02:47.020 --> 02:47.420]  Wait.
[02:47.980 --> 02:48.240]  Wait.
[02:48.520 --> 02:56.600]  And this is the reason that Geoff asked me how I was doing, because I am currently quarantining, because I was around Geoff after he tested positive.
[02:56.600 --> 02:58.740]  You both have COVID again?
[02:59.300 --> 02:59.540]  Gavin?
[02:59.660 --> 02:59.780]  Yeah.
[02:59.900 --> 03:01.140]  Why don't you have COVID?
[03:02.220 --> 03:04.800]  Andrew and I clearly went out and got COVID.
[03:05.300 --> 03:06.780]  Andrew didn't go to Italy either.
[03:07.260 --> 03:07.660]  Are you sure?
[03:10.080 --> 03:13.280]  You're gonna start getting cucumber photos in Italy, like, in a week from now.
[03:14.180 --> 03:15.280]  Oh, that sucks.
[03:15.760 --> 03:17.280]  Yeah, it does.
[03:17.440 --> 03:19.980]  That was really mean of you, Geoff, to open with no one.
[03:20.040 --> 03:20.880]  Gavin, how are you?
[03:21.240 --> 03:21.740]  Just no one.
[03:21.960 --> 03:22.400]  Great.
[03:23.140 --> 03:23.580]  Great.
[03:23.840 --> 03:24.600]  Great, Geoff.
[03:24.820 --> 03:26.300]  Tell us more about how good you feel.
[03:26.300 --> 03:29.780]  If that was a different order, I would have been less excited about how good I felt.
[03:30.280 --> 03:31.780]  To try and make you guys feel better.
[03:34.260 --> 03:38.900]  No, Andrew and I found out, I got COVID Monday, or I got, well, who knows when I got it.
[03:39.020 --> 03:41.940]  I was diagnosed with COVID Monday, and then he tested positive Tuesday.
[03:42.340 --> 03:43.920]  So we're going through it together.
[03:44.160 --> 03:45.340]  We're buddies, though.
[03:46.300 --> 03:50.860]  I texted Geoff last night, and I just wrote, remember when we made a podcast together?
[03:52.560 --> 03:54.080]  Because it's been so long.
[03:54.080 --> 03:55.680]  It probably isn't.
[03:55.720 --> 03:57.660]  This feels like the longest gap ever, though, for some reason.
[03:57.840 --> 03:58.600]  It feels so long.
[03:58.700 --> 04:05.600]  Oh, by the way, real fast, Eric, I have a production-related question I'd like to ask you.
[04:05.920 --> 04:06.240]  Sure.
[04:06.960 --> 04:07.160]  Okay.
[04:07.720 --> 04:17.960]  I would like to formally request a special one-time-use regulation episode length variance to be used specifically for end-of-episode extension purposes for today and today only.
[04:18.260 --> 04:22.720]  Because we haven't been together in so long, and we're only filming one episode.
[04:22.720 --> 04:25.660]  Maybe you'd let us go a few minutes over so we could catch up.
[04:26.220 --> 04:28.780]  I'm checking my notes, looking at schedules.
[04:28.960 --> 04:29.500]  Hang on.
[04:30.860 --> 04:31.220]  Okay.
[04:31.720 --> 04:33.700]  Geoff, your request is granted.
[04:34.100 --> 04:35.040]  Oh, thank you very much.
[04:35.120 --> 04:36.060]  Just like an extra ten minutes.
[04:36.140 --> 04:36.480]  That'd be nice.
[04:36.780 --> 04:39.600]  Give us some breathing room today, since it's so hard for Andrew and I.
[04:39.600 --> 04:42.000]  We both could use, yeah, some breathing room, I think would be good.
[04:43.120 --> 04:45.140]  Any breathing, additional breathing space would be great.
[04:45.520 --> 04:49.100]  Gavin, before we recorded this, Gavin, you had a thing you said.
[04:49.360 --> 04:49.980]  What did you say?
[04:50.060 --> 04:50.920]  You had a demand.
[04:51.160 --> 04:52.360]  You had a singular demand.
[04:52.940 --> 04:54.460]  That you'd measured your back.
[04:54.820 --> 04:56.900]  So last night, I'm isolating.
[04:57.580 --> 04:58.060]  Currently.
[04:58.680 --> 05:02.200]  And I was reminded that I still had not measured my back.
[05:02.640 --> 05:05.140]  So I got those fresh measurements for you.
[05:05.420 --> 05:05.700]  Today.
[05:06.260 --> 05:10.300]  Okay, and we found out that I had a 21 to 22 inch back.
[05:10.660 --> 05:10.880]  Yep.
[05:11.360 --> 05:14.740]  Eric had a load of bollocks, a load of shit.
[05:15.940 --> 05:18.400]  And I think Geoff had a similar length back to me.
[05:18.440 --> 05:19.780]  I was 22 inches, yeah.
[05:19.940 --> 05:20.160]  Yeah.
[05:20.560 --> 05:21.800]  I think you guys just have short backs.
[05:21.800 --> 05:23.160]  What was your number, Eric?
[05:23.200 --> 05:24.100]  You're 25, right?
[05:24.180 --> 05:24.740]  Was the report?
[05:24.900 --> 05:25.420]  That's correct.
[05:25.820 --> 05:26.140]  Okay.
[05:27.040 --> 05:27.520]  25.
[05:28.140 --> 05:28.620]  So...
[05:29.920 --> 05:34.700]  Before I give my number for my back measurement, I should tell the story of there was a time
[05:34.700 --> 05:38.840]  in the past when I measured my hand to see how big my hand was.
[05:38.980 --> 05:40.920]  And I measured it as 11 inches.
[05:41.240 --> 05:43.640]  And I lived my life for quite a while.
[05:43.900 --> 05:46.100]  Thinking I had 11 inch hands.
[05:46.100 --> 05:52.140]  And then I read randomly that Shaq's hands were like 10 and a half inch long.
[05:52.360 --> 05:57.700]  I realized there was a miscalculation when my hands would have been bigger than Shaq's.
[05:57.880 --> 06:01.500]  And I consider my hand smaller than the average hand.
[06:02.020 --> 06:03.280]  How did you get 11 inches?
[06:03.520 --> 06:04.600]  I don't know.
[06:04.900 --> 06:05.480]  I have no idea.
[06:05.600 --> 06:08.240]  I didn't use like a measuring tape or anything.
[06:08.440 --> 06:13.080]  It was like a toy I had that had notches on it.
[06:13.100 --> 06:14.560]  And I measured it against that.
[06:16.020 --> 06:18.700]  So you had an 11-notch long hand.
[06:19.580 --> 06:20.020]  Yeah.
[06:20.580 --> 06:21.100]  Yeah.
[06:21.360 --> 06:22.720]  I had an 11-notch long hand.
[06:23.260 --> 06:27.280]  So going into these measurements, that's an important thing to take away.
[06:27.560 --> 06:30.100]  Do we have any guesses how long my back is?
[06:30.340 --> 06:30.980]  Oh, no.
[06:31.520 --> 06:34.720]  Well, I mean, you pride yourself on the length of your torso and back.
[06:35.020 --> 06:37.540]  So it's gonna have to be longer than mine and Geoff's.
[06:37.580 --> 06:39.960]  So I'm gonna say 23 inches.
[06:40.400 --> 06:40.800]  23.
[06:41.220 --> 06:42.660]  Eric is saying 31.
[06:43.480 --> 06:44.220]  Nick guessed 27.
[06:45.080 --> 06:46.160]  Geoff, do you have a guess?
[06:46.500 --> 06:48.540]  And we're guessing in inches, not toy notches.
[06:48.620 --> 06:49.140]  Inches, yeah.
[06:49.380 --> 06:50.160]  Proper inches.
[06:50.600 --> 06:51.560]  I used a measuring tape.
[06:51.660 --> 06:53.700]  I did this very professionally.
[06:54.420 --> 06:57.440]  And you did to that nobule on the top of the spine.
[06:57.700 --> 06:59.760]  I did the nobule on the top of the spine.
[06:59.760 --> 07:00.200]  The small of your back.
[07:00.640 --> 07:03.520]  Yeah, kind of the crutch, the crux.
[07:03.880 --> 07:04.640]  The crux of the back.
[07:06.540 --> 07:06.940]  Crutch?
[07:07.440 --> 07:10.060]  I mean, I think whatever the answer is, it's gonna be bullshit.
[07:10.280 --> 07:11.100]  But I'm gonna say 27.
[07:11.740 --> 07:13.440]  I took this very seriously.
[07:13.440 --> 07:15.080]  I did it multiple times to make sure.
[07:15.520 --> 07:21.220]  I have, by my measurements, a 26 inch back.
[07:22.540 --> 07:23.300]  26 inches.
[07:23.720 --> 07:24.500]  That seems like bullshit.
[07:24.760 --> 07:25.460]  That is...
[07:25.460 --> 07:26.480]  You think that's bullshit?
[07:26.860 --> 07:28.020]  Complete nonsense.
[07:28.600 --> 07:28.960]  Why?
[07:29.340 --> 07:30.480]  What makes you say that?
[07:30.800 --> 07:33.500]  You're saying you've got 4 inches more back than me?
[07:33.920 --> 07:35.140]  Yes, I am saying that.
[07:35.360 --> 07:36.380]  Aren't we the same height?
[07:36.960 --> 07:38.180]  We've talked about this before.
[07:38.420 --> 07:39.120]  I'm all back.
[07:39.440 --> 07:40.240]  I'm a lot of back.
[07:40.380 --> 07:41.500]  How tall are you?
[07:41.500 --> 07:43.080]  I'm 5 foot 10.
[07:43.680 --> 07:49.840]  You're telling me you're 2 inches shorter than me, and you have a 4 inch bigger back.
[07:50.100 --> 07:50.780]  Yes, I am.
[07:51.120 --> 07:51.660]  That's crazy.
[07:51.720 --> 07:53.820]  I did some numbers, because I was curious.
[07:54.520 --> 07:58.220]  5 foot 10 means I'm around 70 inches tall.
[07:58.720 --> 08:00.500]  I'm 37% back.
[08:01.160 --> 08:03.340]  I got a 37% back.
[08:03.720 --> 08:06.160]  And then that made me think, well, what are my other dimensions?
[08:06.740 --> 08:07.380]  Where am I?
[08:07.380 --> 08:15.800]  So I went from the rest of my neck to the top of my head, and I'm 18% neck to top of head.
[08:16.080 --> 08:17.420]  That's the other side.
[08:18.300 --> 08:19.300]  I'm like 12 inches.
[08:19.920 --> 08:21.380]  So your head is half your back?
[08:22.400 --> 08:23.440]  I guess, yeah.
[08:23.560 --> 08:24.820]  Well, no, it's a little less.
[08:25.100 --> 08:25.440]  Wait, what?
[08:26.660 --> 08:29.560]  I got 12 inches from the neck to the top of the head.
[08:30.160 --> 08:30.400]  Okay?
[08:30.860 --> 08:33.800]  How are you 37% back and 18% head?
[08:34.780 --> 08:37.160]  Well, I'm gonna lay out the rest of my figures.
[08:37.440 --> 08:38.040]  Okay.
[08:38.380 --> 08:39.600]  I got all these written down.
[08:39.620 --> 08:41.000]  Let's keep track of this.
[08:41.160 --> 08:46.120]  I'm 18% for 100%, so obviously a person is 100% of whatever.
[08:46.660 --> 08:56.940]  I'm 18% neck to top of head, 37% back, 17% butt length, 28% legs.
[08:58.780 --> 09:01.140]  That adds up to 100%.
[09:01.140 --> 09:05.160]  So you're saying you got 9% more back than legs?
[09:05.900 --> 09:06.760]  I do, yeah.
[09:08.020 --> 09:09.420]  That's a big 9%, though.
[09:09.660 --> 09:10.120]  That's a lot.
[09:10.220 --> 09:11.640]  That's a lot in that 9%.
[09:11.640 --> 09:15.880]  And if you take all of those measurements, because obviously you've figured out the percentage from the measurements in inches.
[09:16.180 --> 09:20.500]  Have you added together all of those inches to make up the 70-whatever inches?
[09:20.540 --> 09:21.200]  100%, yeah.
[09:21.280 --> 09:22.300]  No, I took this very seriously.
[09:22.640 --> 09:22.920]  Okay.
[09:23.060 --> 09:24.560]  I made sure I made the math work.
[09:24.820 --> 09:27.680]  I'm gonna be honest, I had some issues with the math initially.
[09:27.680 --> 09:31.620]  I was a 49% man for a while, and I couldn't figure out what was going wrong.
[09:32.240 --> 09:33.260]  Percentages can be difficult.
[09:34.040 --> 09:36.600]  I eventually got to 89%, but I got help.
[09:36.820 --> 09:37.900]  We figured it out.
[09:38.120 --> 09:38.740]  We got there.
[09:38.920 --> 09:41.720]  You're panicking because you can't find your other 11%?
[09:41.940 --> 09:42.220]  Well, no.
[09:42.440 --> 09:44.020]  Yeah, it was tough.
[09:44.120 --> 09:46.280]  I was like, why am I a 49% man?
[09:46.760 --> 09:47.400]  What has happened?
[09:48.060 --> 09:49.220]  What are your legs again?
[09:49.300 --> 09:49.740]  29?
[09:50.140 --> 09:50.800]  What is it?
[09:50.940 --> 09:51.760]  My legs?
[09:51.940 --> 09:53.760]  I'm at 28% legs.
[09:53.940 --> 09:55.040]  How's that possible?
[09:55.580 --> 09:56.520]  I'm just 28%.
[09:56.520 --> 09:58.520]  Are you less than 30% leg?
[09:58.660 --> 10:01.420]  I'm less than 30% leg, based on my calculations.
[10:02.080 --> 10:04.200]  A, you're an idiot.
[10:04.540 --> 10:10.640]  And B, do you think you could eat 24 inches of pancakes?
[10:11.020 --> 10:12.200]  That seems like a lot.
[10:12.740 --> 10:13.740]  Right now, no.
[10:13.900 --> 10:14.620]  I don't think I could.
[10:14.700 --> 10:16.000]  I don't think I have that in me.
[10:16.040 --> 10:18.320]  So the answer to this very long question is...
[10:18.320 --> 10:23.560]  Now, I expected some kickback on this by you guys.
[10:23.640 --> 10:26.040]  I thought you'd think that my measurements were inaccurate.
[10:26.040 --> 10:28.620]  And with the Shack Hands thing, I think that's fair.
[10:29.100 --> 10:31.400]  I think having some doubts is a reasonable concern.
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.580]  So I reached out to the people that do the animation show that we make.
[10:37.840 --> 10:40.460]  And I wrote down my percentages.
[10:41.060 --> 10:48.960]  And I said, without context, could you have somebody draw someone with what these percentages, what you interpret they would look like?
[10:49.060 --> 10:51.120]  So I'm going to post a photo in the chat right now.
[10:51.460 --> 10:53.700]  This is what it looks like based off of that.
[10:53.700 --> 10:56.460]  And I gotta say, I think I look pretty good.
[10:56.820 --> 10:58.060]  I think that's me.
[10:58.600 --> 10:59.680]  Okay, to be honest.
[11:01.560 --> 11:02.400]  That is you.
[11:02.700 --> 11:04.040]  That's pretty close to me.
[11:09.640 --> 11:12.720]  They're so talented, all the people that do the art for a show.
[11:13.140 --> 11:16.700]  As someone who's stood next to you a lot, that is you.
[11:16.780 --> 11:18.780]  Except why in the name of Christ...
[11:18.780 --> 11:19.580]  Wait, is that a thumb?
[11:19.760 --> 11:21.280]  How many fingers do you have on that hand?
[11:21.300 --> 11:21.880]  What's going on?
[11:22.980 --> 11:24.480]  One, two, three, four...
[11:24.480 --> 11:25.740]  Yeah, I think that's four.
[11:25.960 --> 11:27.200]  I think the fingers are right.
[11:27.480 --> 11:28.780]  That's not supposed to be me.
[11:29.160 --> 11:30.880]  It's just, I said, draw someone.
[11:31.160 --> 11:31.520]  That's you.
[11:31.600 --> 11:32.860]  But it is me.
[11:33.120 --> 11:33.700]  That's my point.
[11:34.620 --> 11:36.780]  I don't understand how that's not supposed to be you.
[11:36.960 --> 11:37.520]  That's you.
[11:38.080 --> 11:40.680]  Because I said, I didn't say draw me.
[11:40.980 --> 11:43.840]  I said, these are these figures that I measured.
[11:44.400 --> 11:46.580]  Have somebody draw this without context.
[11:46.720 --> 11:49.000]  Just what it would look like with these things.
[11:49.080 --> 11:49.480]  And it's me.
[11:50.080 --> 11:51.300]  So it is me, but it isn't me.
[11:51.300 --> 11:51.940]  That's what I'm saying.
[11:51.980 --> 11:53.300]  They didn't try to make me.
[11:53.860 --> 11:55.700]  They just took the parts and it is me.
[11:55.740 --> 11:56.860]  Because my measurements are correct.
[11:57.260 --> 11:57.760]  You know what?
[11:57.920 --> 12:02.340]  I'm going to, based on this drawing alone, I'm going to accept your measurements until
[12:02.340 --> 12:07.580]  we can be, until we're in person and can have somebody measure us all next to each other.
[12:08.300 --> 12:10.120]  I can't argue with that image of you.
[12:10.200 --> 12:11.280]  That's a great image, though.
[12:11.960 --> 12:14.000]  They sent it to me as proportions guy.
[12:14.140 --> 12:14.840]  And I love that.
[12:15.200 --> 12:16.060]  As proportions guy.
[12:18.960 --> 12:23.040]  Would you feel offended if the next time I see you in real life, I measure the shit
[12:23.040 --> 12:23.480]  out of you?
[12:23.740 --> 12:24.620]  No, absolutely not.
[12:24.940 --> 12:25.180]  Okay.
[12:25.240 --> 12:27.960]  Because I just need, obviously, I need the real figures.
[12:28.400 --> 12:29.060]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[12:29.220 --> 12:32.240]  And as somebody, I believe I'm top of back mountain right now.
[12:32.460 --> 12:34.160]  So that's a crown that I respect.
[12:34.800 --> 12:35.940]  Yeah, was it 26 you said?
[12:36.460 --> 12:37.080]  Yeah, 26.
[12:37.720 --> 12:38.860]  I can send you my numbers.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.360]  You can cross reference with your numbers at a future time.
[12:41.760 --> 12:43.200]  But that's just a backup date.
[12:43.200 --> 12:47.500]  I know I let that slip in the past and wanted to make sure I was on top of it.
[12:48.020 --> 12:49.040]  Got my totals done.
[12:49.600 --> 12:50.320]  That is excellent.
[12:51.020 --> 12:51.420]  Excellent.
[12:51.920 --> 12:53.140]  Excellent closure, I think.
[12:53.580 --> 12:54.460]  I totally agree.
[12:54.700 --> 12:54.900]  Yeah.
[12:55.260 --> 12:56.720]  Thank you for the visual aids.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.280]  Another thing in the past that we talked about that I feel like we should probably address.
[13:02.420 --> 13:03.280]  Gavin, do you have a nickname?
[13:04.020 --> 13:04.640]  That was homework.
[13:04.760 --> 13:06.820]  We're supposed to come up with nicknames, I believe.
[13:07.320 --> 13:09.160]  Oh, nicknames like T-Bone that we wanted?
[13:09.160 --> 13:13.260]  Yeah, like Geoff had T-Bone and I think he wanted us to come up with nicknames.
[13:13.860 --> 13:18.100]  Just like if you want a nickname, now's the time to give yourself one.
[13:18.680 --> 13:20.480]  I think I got one. I got a great one.
[13:21.180 --> 13:22.680]  I feel really good about mine.
[13:22.800 --> 13:23.580]  Okay, go for it.
[13:23.760 --> 13:28.600]  I was... this is... I didn't come up with a nickname. My partner gave me this nickname.
[13:29.320 --> 13:31.280]  I was in bed...
[13:31.280 --> 13:32.600]  Nick said Backman.
[13:33.420 --> 13:33.860]  Backman?
[13:35.980 --> 13:37.460]  26 inch Backman.
[13:38.260 --> 13:39.620]  That'd be a great action figure.
[13:39.820 --> 13:42.840]  Just like all back. Hit the button. Do stuff.
[13:43.060 --> 13:46.700]  Anyway, I was in bed. I was relaxing.
[13:47.720 --> 13:51.500]  And they walked into the room and I had my icing on my head, as I do.
[13:52.140 --> 13:54.400]  Just having a good relaxing time.
[13:55.140 --> 13:57.460]  And they said, oh no, do you have a headache?
[13:57.600 --> 14:00.360]  And then I explained, no, this is just a thing I'm now doing for leisure.
[14:00.800 --> 14:01.840]  This is just comfortable.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.320]  And they've started calling me Frosty.
[14:05.320 --> 14:06.620]  Because it's like frosting.
[14:07.360 --> 14:10.100]  So that's my new nickname. I'm Frosty now.
[14:10.680 --> 14:11.260]  A great nickname.
[14:11.860 --> 14:12.540]  Frosty Patton?
[14:13.040 --> 14:15.940]  Frosty Patton. I didn't even associate the last name with the first.
[14:16.360 --> 14:17.940]  But I feel really good about Frosty.
[14:18.180 --> 14:20.780]  It happened the day after we had that recording.
[14:20.980 --> 14:22.780]  And I was like, holy shit, it's perfect.
[14:23.400 --> 14:23.880]  Frosty.
[14:24.300 --> 14:26.880]  Gavin, how are you doing on your nickname search?
[14:27.900 --> 14:29.360]  I couldn't really think of anything.
[14:29.520 --> 14:32.860]  And then something came into my head that I like.
[14:32.860 --> 14:34.360]  And it's Ramscoop.
[14:36.120 --> 14:36.520]  Okay.
[14:37.840 --> 14:39.860]  So is it like one name Ramscoop?
[14:40.560 --> 14:42.700]  Or is it like first Ram, last Scoop?
[14:44.100 --> 14:44.880]  What's the thought?
[14:44.920 --> 14:46.360]  No, it would just be one name Ramscoop.
[14:46.720 --> 14:50.460]  And it's because I remembered, I think I had Red Dwarf in my head.
[14:50.580 --> 14:52.040]  This is the ship from Red Dwarf.
[14:52.300 --> 14:53.900]  And up in the front is the Ramscoop.
[14:54.140 --> 14:55.640]  And I just thought, that's a good name.
[14:56.180 --> 14:56.900]  I like it.
[14:57.140 --> 15:00.100]  Geoff, you don't think he's kind of like walking into your name territory?
[15:00.840 --> 15:02.220]  Oh, because the REM thing?
[15:02.220 --> 15:03.820]  Nah, it's fine.
[15:04.020 --> 15:05.080]  Oh shit, I didn't even think of that.
[15:05.160 --> 15:06.040]  I'm okay with that.
[15:06.060 --> 15:08.320]  Really, you didn't think of that? That's the first thing I thought of.
[15:08.860 --> 15:11.820]  Oh, you know what, Geoff? If you want to take Ramscoop, I'll give it up.
[15:11.960 --> 15:13.500]  No, no, I'm happy with T-Bone.
[15:13.720 --> 15:14.740]  I got T-Bone.
[15:14.860 --> 15:18.300]  And I've only ever seen one episode of Red Dwarf, so it would be disingenuous of me.
[15:18.700 --> 15:18.900]  Okay.
[15:19.300 --> 15:20.480]  I think Ramscoop.
[15:20.900 --> 15:22.720]  That's the thing, you name yourself whatever you want.
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.400]  This is win carte blanche here.
[15:24.620 --> 15:26.400]  We don't have to wait to be gifted to us.
[15:27.120 --> 15:31.200]  And you end up with some dumbass nickname, like they called me Geoffro in 6th grade.
[15:35.660 --> 15:36.420]  That's great.
[15:37.340 --> 15:39.920]  Yeah, I didn't like it then, that's why I'm T-Bone now.
[15:42.040 --> 15:45.080]  Honestly, Ramscoop has supporting character energy to it.
[15:45.160 --> 15:47.920]  Like, I could see T-Bone and Ramscoop working together.
[15:48.240 --> 15:50.640]  Yeah, I would always be after the end, I think.
[15:50.960 --> 15:54.340]  No one's ever starting with Ramscoop, and that's a place I'm happy to be.
[15:54.520 --> 15:56.820]  Like, Frosty T-Bone and Ramscoop.
[15:56.860 --> 15:58.620]  That's exactly what I was going to say.
[15:58.620 --> 16:04.940]  Like, this would be like, Frosty would bring you into his gang, and he'd be like, this is T-Bone, and this is Ramscoop.
[16:06.260 --> 16:13.820]  And I feel like if it was like a TV series, and those are the three main characters, you would have the first two names memorized by the end of episode 1 and 2.
[16:14.080 --> 16:16.820]  But it'd take you until episode 4 to remember Ramscoop, I think.
[16:18.640 --> 16:21.540]  I picture us as the supporting cast of Hot Rod.
[16:22.320 --> 16:23.220]  I can see that.
[16:24.140 --> 16:28.160]  Yeah, just sitting around, Bill Hader, just talking about how we love the party.
[16:31.160 --> 16:33.920]  I've got a video, if we want to watch a video together.
[16:34.180 --> 16:35.640]  I would love to watch a video.
[16:36.080 --> 16:42.220]  I'll give the backstory. This is from a YouTube channel called Geowizard, where he does a lot of stuff.
[16:42.400 --> 16:46.500]  Like, he'll try and walk across the country in a straight line, which is really funny.
[16:46.720 --> 16:48.960]  And I've talked about it before on podcasts, it's a good channel.
[16:49.060 --> 16:50.360]  And he does Geoguessr as well.
[16:51.020 --> 16:55.820]  So pretty much every time he does a straight line mission across the country, I'll also watch some other videos.
[16:55.980 --> 16:57.520]  And this is called TimeGuessr, I guess.
[16:57.980 --> 17:02.260]  So it's similar to Geoguessr, but you just get a picture that's not necessarily a historical picture.
[17:02.680 --> 17:07.640]  You have to use the context clues to figure out where exactly it is on the map, and then what year it is.
[17:08.280 --> 17:14.320]  So I figure that currently he's looking at this sign and he's seen Monroe, so he thinks it's potentially in Monroe, Louisiana.
[17:14.820 --> 17:16.260]  And then we'll just watch this clip together.
[17:16.780 --> 17:18.520]  We don't actually have anything, do we?
[17:18.520 --> 17:22.560]  The chances of these things still going is ridiculous.
[17:22.780 --> 17:25.220]  And there is a Navy sailor.
[17:25.500 --> 17:26.740]  I didn't notice him.
[17:31.850 --> 17:34.210]  I don't think they're coming up here, man.
[17:34.790 --> 17:39.550]  So I don't think this is going to be right, but I'm going to go for it.
[17:40.170 --> 17:41.730]  Let's just go in the middle of there.
[17:41.870 --> 17:42.710]  And now for the year.
[17:46.070 --> 17:46.990]  Well, 45.
[17:46.990 --> 17:49.110]  Wait a minute.
[17:51.010 --> 17:52.010]  Key West.
[17:52.730 --> 17:54.270]  I don't believe it.
[17:54.970 --> 17:56.150]  Is this Key West?
[17:57.170 --> 17:58.770]  Oh, God. Good riddance, Monroe.
[17:59.170 --> 18:00.290]  See you later.
[18:00.590 --> 18:03.510]  It's got to be Key West. That makes more sense as well.
[18:04.010 --> 18:05.550]  Is that Sloppy Joe's?
[18:05.690 --> 18:07.370]  That's a very strategic place.
[18:07.810 --> 18:09.990]  It looks like Sloppy Joe's to me.
[18:10.110 --> 18:10.950]  Duval Street?
[18:11.710 --> 18:13.350]  Let's look at the shadows here.
[18:13.350 --> 18:18.050]  The sun will be definitely in the south here.
[18:18.870 --> 18:20.570]  And the shadows come from there.
[18:20.910 --> 18:21.970]  This guy's like a scientist.
[18:22.210 --> 18:25.570]  I would put us on something like this.
[18:25.950 --> 18:27.910]  I'm not even going to look for any of these.
[18:28.090 --> 18:30.610]  Okay, did you see where he clicked?
[18:31.330 --> 18:31.670]  No.
[18:32.270 --> 18:32.950]  Could you see this?
[18:33.430 --> 18:34.810]  I mean, it's a little blown out for us.
[18:35.010 --> 18:36.030]  It's a little blown out, but yeah.
[18:36.390 --> 18:40.550]  He clicked in the intersection right next to Sloppy Joe's.
[18:40.550 --> 18:44.590]  He clicked exactly where the cameras are pointing on the live stream.
[18:45.790 --> 18:47.790]  What are the freaking chances of that?
[18:47.910 --> 18:50.370]  It turns out it's the right street.
[18:50.570 --> 18:52.030]  The picture is just slightly further down.
[18:52.530 --> 18:56.290]  But I spat my drink out when I saw where he clicked.
[18:57.230 --> 18:59.730]  And it was literally where we watch.
[19:00.390 --> 19:03.910]  It was like a week after we did that Sloppy Joe's bingo.
[19:04.610 --> 19:07.490]  He was about half a kilometer off.
[19:07.490 --> 19:11.050]  And he clicked in the intersection.
[19:12.070 --> 19:13.750]  That is fucking insane.
[19:14.010 --> 19:20.210]  And I have one little piece of Sloppy Joe's trivia that I could throw out to add color to this if you'd like.
[19:21.290 --> 19:21.570]  Yes.
[19:21.790 --> 19:28.110]  I was reading on the Sloppy Joe's wiki while I was on vacation about the origin of the Sloppy Joe.
[19:28.270 --> 19:29.190]  And listen to this passage.
[19:29.190 --> 19:40.350]  One theory of the sandwich's origin is that in 1917, in a Havana Cuba bar, owner Jose Sloppy Joe Abiel E. Otero created a simple sandwich filled with meat and stewed tomatoes.
[19:40.550 --> 19:42.470]  It was his interpretation of a picadillo.
[19:42.890 --> 19:54.290]  His bar was reportedly frequented by Americans and Britons, including Ernest Hemingway, obviously, Graham Greene, who's a fantastic writer if you've never read any of his work, and Errol Flynn.
[19:55.450 --> 19:56.030]  What?
[19:56.030 --> 19:56.610]  What?
[19:58.190 --> 20:06.450]  His bar was reportedly frequented by Americans and Britons, including Errol Flynn, Ernest Hemingway, and Graham Greene, circa 1937.
[20:06.810 --> 20:07.210]  What is happening?
[20:07.610 --> 20:11.930]  Hemingway then convinced him to move to Key West, Florida, or whatever.
[20:12.370 --> 20:22.590]  Dude, Errol fucking Flynn, who only exists in our universe because you called yourself Errol, went to fucking Sloppy Joe's with Ernest Hemingway!
[20:22.590 --> 20:29.390]  And it's not like he just went there and no one noticed, he's notably someone who went there, to the point where it was written and recorded.
[20:29.790 --> 20:37.550]  And then I watch a YouTube channel where someone incorrectly guesses right outside Sloppy Joe's. Everything's happening at the same time, it's crazy.
[20:38.070 --> 20:46.610]  There's been a lot of great Sloppy Joe's stuff recently. Geoff, are you aware of their Independence Day? Are you familiar with the Conk Republic?
[20:47.330 --> 20:49.050]  Yeah, I am familiar with the Conk Republic.
[20:49.050 --> 20:59.450]  I had no idea that was a thing. So Geoff, you went on vacation to Italy. You went on vacation during their Independence Day week, which I thought was terrible timing for Sloppy Joe's stuff.
[20:59.850 --> 21:02.910]  I've been trying to watch it, I didn't know anything about it. Geoff, are you aware of the Conk Republic?
[21:03.430 --> 21:03.690]  No.
[21:04.150 --> 21:07.730]  They set up, I don't remember when this was, maybe like the 70s?
[21:07.830 --> 21:08.610]  It was the 80s, I think.
[21:08.810 --> 21:10.190]  80s? Yeah. Okay.
[21:10.890 --> 21:19.370]  They randomly, the government, set up a checkpoint on the one highway out of town, like right in the center of their area, essentially.
[21:19.570 --> 21:24.750]  So you had to clear the security checkpoint to leave the Keys. And it was killing tourism.
[21:25.090 --> 21:30.290]  And so they were trying to get it removed, and they wouldn't remove it. They were ignoring all requests.
[21:30.290 --> 21:40.570]  So the mayor of Key West essentially gathered people and got everybody to agree to defect from the U.S. and to call themselves the Conk Republic.
[21:41.170 --> 21:46.110]  And they started war. They immediately declared war against the United States and then surrendered.
[21:46.530 --> 21:54.910]  But it was just all like a publicity stunt to try to get media attention on the fact that they wouldn't get rid of this checkpoint that was killing their town, essentially.
[21:55.570 --> 22:03.390]  And it worked. But now every year they celebrate the Independence Day from America of the Conk Republic.
[22:03.770 --> 22:06.290]  And they do like a whole week tourism shit. And it's great.
[22:06.710 --> 22:08.430]  So how long were they technically at war?
[22:08.650 --> 22:09.410]  Two weeks. I think two weeks.
[22:10.050 --> 22:12.310]  They seceded from the Union for like two weeks.
[22:12.750 --> 22:13.450]  It was very brief.
[22:13.610 --> 22:14.150]  Quite a long time.
[22:14.670 --> 22:18.170]  Yeah. And that's why they call themselves the Conk Republic now. And it's a great marketing tool.
[22:18.550 --> 22:20.070]  And it worked out really well for them.
[22:20.670 --> 22:24.210]  So what do you need to be able to declare war on the country that you're in?
[22:25.550 --> 22:26.970]  Just enough people?
[22:27.770 --> 22:34.490]  I guess, yeah. I guess if everyone agrees and the people in power, you can then remove and attack.
[22:34.790 --> 22:35.270]  Interesting.
[22:35.770 --> 22:44.910]  There was like some issue I want to say where like there was a rally for it and somebody hit a naval officer with a thing of like dried bread.
[22:45.430 --> 22:52.010]  And so like the declaration of war was almost like a panic move to like calm the crowd to then immediately surrender was the idea.
[22:52.950 --> 22:54.550]  At least from my understanding of it.
[22:54.630 --> 22:56.290]  This is crazy. I had no idea that was the thing.
[22:56.630 --> 22:58.090]  There was a parade going on.
[22:58.170 --> 22:59.110]  I was like, what is happening?
[22:59.510 --> 23:00.270]  What are they celebrating?
[23:00.350 --> 23:01.390]  How is Geoff missing this?
[23:02.590 --> 23:03.510]  Also, I need to send a file.
[23:03.630 --> 23:06.590]  I've been recording some clips from Sloppy Joe's.
[23:06.690 --> 23:11.410]  I had one of the greatest arguments I've ever seen of 20 minutes, a 20 minute long.
[23:11.470 --> 23:15.910]  It's the most compelling television I've ever watched of a wedding gone wrong.
[23:17.290 --> 23:19.350]  Was it was it close to slop o'clock?
[23:19.950 --> 23:20.610]  It was.
[23:20.690 --> 23:21.210]  Yeah, it was.
[23:21.650 --> 23:22.030]  What?
[23:22.130 --> 23:29.170]  I would've been like 1245 Eastern, which I feel like Geoff is that that kind of like probably 1111 15 is when slop o'clock starts.
[23:29.270 --> 23:30.150]  So, yeah, you're right in there.
[23:30.350 --> 23:32.870]  OK, well, it's like prime slop o'clock.
[23:32.950 --> 23:35.170]  And honestly, it was kind of quiet as disappointing.
[23:35.350 --> 23:43.430]  And I was like, oh, man, this is I'm surprised that with the independence festivities and all that stuff like this isn't around your time.
[23:43.690 --> 23:49.150]  And then just out of nowhere, just hearing somebody say, I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
[23:49.150 --> 23:52.110]  And then a guy going, you crossed the line.
[23:52.370 --> 23:54.650]  There's a line and you crossed it.
[23:54.770 --> 23:56.410]  And then it just kept going.
[23:56.590 --> 23:59.010]  And she's like, you're going to ruin Kyle's wedding.
[23:59.170 --> 24:00.810]  And she's like, I don't give a fuck.
[24:00.890 --> 24:01.630]  I don't care.
[24:01.810 --> 24:02.470]  I don't care.
[24:02.890 --> 24:03.450]  I don't care.
[24:03.770 --> 24:04.910]  You crossed the line.
[24:05.070 --> 24:05.770]  The line was crossed.
[24:06.070 --> 24:08.250]  I am going to stay here and I'm going to fight this guy.
[24:08.250 --> 24:12.970]  And just hearing like, we are not going to get arrested in Key West.
[24:13.250 --> 24:14.070]  And it kept building.
[24:14.390 --> 24:18.410]  And then eventually the groom shows up and like tried to come and it just kept escalating.
[24:19.090 --> 24:19.690]  And it was crazy.
[24:19.990 --> 24:21.250]  Yeah, it was fantastic.
[24:21.450 --> 24:23.090]  I need to send you footage, Geoff.
[24:23.190 --> 24:24.350]  I can send it to you if you want it, Gavin.
[24:24.510 --> 24:25.630]  It's an all time argument.
[24:26.150 --> 24:29.990]  At some time or at some point in it, somebody yells, this isn't Game of Thrones.
[24:30.230 --> 24:30.790]  It's great.
[24:31.110 --> 24:32.790]  It's a fantastic fight.
[24:32.790 --> 24:37.550]  And it's been honestly the high of maybe like any entertainment I've watched this year.
[24:37.670 --> 24:39.110]  Was the Sloppy Joe's livestream.
[24:39.430 --> 24:41.510]  Should we do a live Sloppy Joe's bingo soon?
[24:42.190 --> 24:42.410]  Yeah.
[24:42.650 --> 24:46.290]  I actually have a date that I want to pitch to you guys after this record.
[24:46.390 --> 24:46.870]  I'm not doing it.
[24:47.310 --> 24:54.930]  Yeah, but there's some stuff in the works, Gav, so that we can hopefully do one before too long.
[24:55.130 --> 24:58.330]  Actually, pretty soon.
[24:59.170 --> 25:00.310]  When this comes out?
[25:00.490 --> 25:00.950]  Pretty soon.
[25:01.530 --> 25:01.990]  Yeah.
[25:03.410 --> 25:06.310]  So hopefully everybody's available because I'm very, very excited about it.
[25:06.510 --> 25:09.850]  Man, I got to say, going to Italy for 11 days was awesome.
[25:09.990 --> 25:11.250]  And I had a wonderful vacation.
[25:11.990 --> 25:16.250]  And if the souvenir of my 11 days in Italy was COVID, it was worth it.
[25:18.870 --> 25:21.410]  Man, I got to see a lot of churches.
[25:22.010 --> 25:22.550]  Holy shit.
[25:23.230 --> 25:26.730]  But I tried to keep tabs on Sloppy Joe's and it was so hard.
[25:28.090 --> 25:29.570]  Fucking NBA was brutal.
[25:29.570 --> 25:31.970]  All the playoff games started at 2 in the morning.
[25:32.590 --> 25:36.290]  And so I'd have to watch from 2 in the morning to 4 in the morning or 4.30 in the morning.
[25:36.670 --> 25:38.350]  And then the Celtics would shit the bed.
[25:38.890 --> 25:45.650]  And then because it was like on a tour I was on that was sometimes on a bus, sometimes on a train, sometimes in a car.
[25:46.690 --> 25:51.090]  Every morning we had to have our bags ready and outside of our room by like 6.15 in the morning.
[25:51.270 --> 25:52.810]  And then we were leaving at like 7.
[25:53.130 --> 25:55.890]  So I didn't sleep for like 10 straight days.
[25:56.330 --> 25:58.810]  Speaking of the Celtics, how were your Italy shits?
[25:58.810 --> 25:59.570]  Yeah.
[26:04.110 --> 26:11.190]  I didn't... well, I learned interestingly enough that I thought I liked Italian food.
[26:11.470 --> 26:14.470]  Turns out I like American Italian food.
[26:16.930 --> 26:18.770]  Every fucking... my shits were fine.
[26:19.370 --> 26:21.010]  My shits were totally fine, unremarkable.
[26:21.790 --> 26:21.930]  Okay.
[26:22.650 --> 26:25.350]  The bidets are weird over there so I tended not to use them.
[26:25.730 --> 26:26.230]  They're like...
[26:26.230 --> 26:26.630]  What's weird about them?
[26:27.630 --> 26:33.790]  They're usually like they're like a handle on a fucking cord that you got to maneuver yourself.
[26:33.930 --> 26:35.330]  I like that my bidet does all the work.
[26:35.470 --> 26:37.830]  I don't want to like start spraying and fucking miss.
[26:38.030 --> 26:39.130]  I just... it was confusing.
[26:40.010 --> 26:42.710]  It was more trouble than it was worth and I ended up making a bigger mess than...
[26:43.430 --> 26:45.130]  Any mess with the bidet is unacceptable.
[26:45.510 --> 26:47.430]  Have you used one that's like a separate appliance?
[26:47.870 --> 26:49.390]  The one that you like get off and squat over?
[26:49.910 --> 26:51.250]  Yeah, I don't like that one either.
[26:51.530 --> 26:51.790]  Okay.
[26:52.710 --> 26:54.030]  I wasn't crazy about that one either.
[26:54.750 --> 26:58.130]  So it was a pretty, you know, I had to wipe my butthole like a savage.
[26:59.390 --> 27:02.830]  Other than that, it's like all the food in Italy, it's like...
[27:02.830 --> 27:03.570]  Do you like spaghetti?
[27:04.030 --> 27:05.330]  Then you'll love it with clams.
[27:06.010 --> 27:07.790]  It's like, oh, but I don't want clams.
[27:07.970 --> 27:09.950]  And they're like, tough shit, clams are in everything.
[27:10.210 --> 27:12.170]  Do you like ravioli? Sure.
[27:12.310 --> 27:13.970]  Then you're gonna love clam ravioli.
[27:14.610 --> 27:16.650]  How do you feel about clam lasagna?
[27:17.070 --> 27:18.090]  Do you like tiramisu?
[27:18.370 --> 27:20.610]  You're gonna love clam tiramisu.
[27:21.290 --> 27:23.390]  God damn with the clams, man.
[27:23.690 --> 27:25.010]  They got a lot of coastline.
[27:25.130 --> 27:27.270]  They really do. The food was pretty good.
[27:27.530 --> 27:31.190]  You realize that like you don't understand what al dente in America is.
[27:31.450 --> 27:33.370]  Al dente is a whole different level.
[27:34.530 --> 27:37.190]  But it was good. The food was mostly good.
[27:37.470 --> 27:41.070]  Did you feel like you had different morning thoughts in a different country?
[27:42.050 --> 27:46.930]  My morning thoughts were, I kind of gave up on them because I was so stressed.
[27:46.990 --> 27:49.090]  Because I was like, I was like waking up two or three times.
[27:49.090 --> 27:53.130]  You know, it's like, I didn't go to bed till like 4.30 after the Celtics lose or whatever.
[27:53.330 --> 27:55.430]  And then I'm asleep for like 45 minutes.
[27:55.430 --> 28:01.390]  And then I got to get up and figure out what toiletries I need to set aside in a backpack so I can get my suitcases packed.
[28:01.490 --> 28:04.490]  Put them outside the door and then go back to sleep for 30 minutes.
[28:04.630 --> 28:05.790]  It's just like it was unproductive.
[28:07.270 --> 28:10.250]  So I didn't really, I have morning thoughts from before and after.
[28:10.710 --> 28:16.790]  But I did, I do have, I have two stories I'd like to share from Italy that I think will kind of encompass my trip.
[28:16.790 --> 28:21.310]  And I'll say from, just for the record, I went to Lake Como.
[28:21.890 --> 28:24.810]  I went to Venice. I went to Florence. I went to Siena.
[28:25.010 --> 28:30.730]  And I went to Rome. And Rome is by far the coolest place I've ever been, probably.
[28:32.590 --> 28:35.010]  And I'd be happy never to go to Venice again.
[28:37.810 --> 28:41.130]  It's just too many fucking people, man. It's just gross.
[28:41.890 --> 28:44.570]  Okay, so I had two things that happened in Italy that I thought you guys might appreciate.
[28:44.570 --> 28:50.730]  One was, I had, I developed an enemy on the trip.
[28:51.350 --> 28:54.730]  I didn't realize how much I need an enemy in my life at all times.
[28:56.070 --> 28:59.210]  But when there isn't one, I found, I, boy, do I find them.
[29:00.070 --> 29:02.670]  So we were on this trip. It was like 22 people, right?
[29:02.870 --> 29:06.850]  And it was like a trip that Emily's parents planned before the pandemic.
[29:07.210 --> 29:08.750]  And we were supposed to go in 2020.
[29:09.430 --> 29:10.990]  And so it's been delayed and delayed and delayed.
[29:11.750 --> 29:16.210]  And so everybody that had initially got tickets all just got even older.
[29:17.250 --> 29:22.930]  Emily and I and her sister-in-law were the only people under 60 on the trip.
[29:23.490 --> 29:27.930]  So everybody was between like 65 and like 80.
[29:30.030 --> 29:32.990]  The kind of people that would be impatient waiting for a proposal.
[29:33.970 --> 29:35.010]  Yeah, kind of.
[29:35.010 --> 29:46.030]  And so I spent the last 11 days moving at the speed of Octogenarian, which was a special kind of challenge in general.
[29:47.270 --> 29:49.530]  But all lovely people, love them to death.
[29:50.050 --> 29:52.430]  But so it's a really intimate trip, right?
[29:52.530 --> 29:54.870]  We comprised five of 22 people.
[29:55.050 --> 29:57.550]  So there were only 17 other people on the trip with us, right?
[29:57.930 --> 29:59.630]  And so you get to know each other very quickly.
[29:59.630 --> 30:04.910]  And they have a lot of like the first night you have you get together in a little in a hotel conference room kind of.
[30:05.230 --> 30:08.250]  And you have to introduce yourselves and tell them about your life.
[30:08.610 --> 30:09.550]  And shit, you would hate it.
[30:09.750 --> 30:10.190]  I also hate it.
[30:10.190 --> 30:10.970]  Oh God, that's so awful.
[30:11.450 --> 30:15.130]  But I, you know, I just I made a dumb joke about like about marrying up or something.
[30:15.430 --> 30:17.250]  And, you know, I was trying to lighten the mood.
[30:17.750 --> 30:19.430]  And but anyway, I was affable.
[30:19.450 --> 30:24.330]  And you get to know everybody's face instantly because there's only like 17 other people that you don't know there.
[30:24.470 --> 30:25.510]  So you learn them immediately.
[30:27.350 --> 30:33.250]  And then you like then we went on a fucking tour together.
[30:33.250 --> 30:37.470]  We went on a boat all across Lake Como, went to all these fucking restaurants together.
[30:37.470 --> 30:39.110]  We have to like mix and match.
[30:39.170 --> 30:40.410]  So we're sitting at each other's tables.
[30:40.410 --> 30:42.070]  And you're like, it's like immersion.
[30:42.270 --> 30:44.850]  You have to you're immersed in these other people's lives.
[30:44.870 --> 30:46.310]  And you get to know them very quickly.
[30:46.410 --> 30:55.110]  So on on day four of this trip, day four, we're going from Venice down to Florence.
[30:55.110 --> 30:57.950]  And we stop at a winery in Tuscany somewhere.
[30:58.450 --> 31:00.710]  That's also like a like a fancy fucking hotel.
[31:00.930 --> 31:08.010]  Like we pull into the driveway and there's there's two Aston Martins and a Ferrari parked in the driveway.
[31:08.090 --> 31:10.790]  And you're like, holy shit, this place is fancy.
[31:11.130 --> 31:16.070]  And then we eat outside and have this like lunch with wine that I can't drink.
[31:16.110 --> 31:19.950]  And so they're just like confused and offended that I don't want their wine from their winery.
[31:19.950 --> 31:25.050]  And then I feel like an asshole and I'm trying to be like, no, I'm just I'll destroy the place if I drink.
[31:25.190 --> 31:26.190]  Please don't, you know.
[31:27.450 --> 31:32.670]  And anyway, I get up and I go to the bathroom and me and all the old ladies get up and go to the bathroom because we have to pee constantly.
[31:33.210 --> 31:37.190]  And I'm standing in line with this group of ladies that I have been on tour.
[31:37.310 --> 31:41.250]  I just I've been on a bus with for four hours, just like having to play bingo together.
[31:41.310 --> 31:42.550]  We played Italy bingo.
[31:43.130 --> 31:44.630]  We just played that day.
[31:45.530 --> 31:46.230]  All together.
[31:47.170 --> 31:51.330]  Like fucking like fucking forced to play bingo about Italy.
[31:51.770 --> 31:53.630]  And by the way, Sloppy J's bingo way better.
[31:55.190 --> 31:58.190]  And I'm standing in line with this lady and there's one of the ladies on the trip.
[31:58.250 --> 32:01.270]  And she turns back and she looks at me and she goes, so are you staying at the winery?
[32:01.530 --> 32:03.850]  And I go, why would I do that?
[32:04.230 --> 32:08.530]  And she goes, no, I mean, because the winery was like a hotel as well.
[32:08.810 --> 32:13.410]  And there was like a pool with like fucking fancy fucking Italian people hanging out by the pool and stuff.
[32:13.410 --> 32:16.610]  And she goes, no, I mean, are you a resident of this hotel?
[32:16.750 --> 32:20.490]  Are you staying here? And I go, what are you talking about?
[32:20.690 --> 32:23.330]  And she goes, are you staying at this hotel?
[32:23.470 --> 32:27.770]  And I go, lady, I've been on a bus with you for four days.
[32:27.910 --> 32:30.470]  And she goes, what? And I go, we're on the tour together.
[32:30.630 --> 32:32.330]  We've been we sat by each other.
[32:32.530 --> 32:36.230]  And she just looked at me with just like disdain in her eyes.
[32:36.230 --> 32:38.950]  And she goes, you must be one of the family then.
[32:38.950 --> 32:42.390]  And just walked away as if like the fat like we're like we saw.
[32:42.610 --> 32:45.290]  I was like, oh, it is fucking on between you and me, lady.
[32:45.730 --> 32:48.710]  So she was my fucking enemy for the next eight days.
[32:48.710 --> 32:50.130]  And I hated her every second.
[32:50.570 --> 32:52.930]  I was still nice to her and I was still polite to her.
[32:52.990 --> 32:57.170]  But I was a little less nice and a little less sincere every time I said something to her.
[32:57.410 --> 32:59.570]  Wow. Were you offended that she didn't know, though?
[33:00.110 --> 33:02.710]  I'm the only person under 80 on the fucking bus.
[33:02.830 --> 33:06.130]  I got covered in tattoos and I'm loud as dicks.
[33:06.330 --> 33:08.570]  How could she have not noticed me?
[33:08.570 --> 33:12.490]  We were together for four days. I sat next to her on a speedboat.
[33:14.330 --> 33:17.430]  I helped her get off the speedboat. I held her dumb hand.
[33:17.930 --> 33:19.450]  Wow. You helped her.
[33:20.890 --> 33:25.830]  That's a bond. Anytime you're riding with someone in a speedboat, that is a genuine bond you have formed.
[33:25.930 --> 33:28.170]  I can't believe that she... that's disrespectful.
[33:28.530 --> 33:29.630]  I totally agree, dude.
[33:29.990 --> 33:35.250]  And so from that point on, I realized the trip got instantly better because I realized I hated her.
[33:35.730 --> 33:39.610]  And then there's just something clicked and it was like, oh, I need this tension in my life.
[33:39.750 --> 33:43.010]  I got to have something to be mad about, you know, or something to... some focus.
[33:43.290 --> 33:46.310]  I mean, that's clearly a thing, though. Like, do they all know about the family?
[33:46.490 --> 33:48.710]  Is it like all of them versus you? Or is it just her?
[33:49.030 --> 33:50.430]  I wondered that as well.
[33:50.650 --> 33:54.090]  Well, she was on a trip with her cousins and they were lovely.
[33:54.170 --> 33:57.470]  And I had many nice conversations with them. So if there was... I don't think so.
[33:57.570 --> 34:01.170]  I don't know. I think it was just her dumb ass, but not a fan of her.
[34:01.450 --> 34:01.790]  Not a fan.
[34:01.790 --> 34:02.590]  Where was she from?
[34:03.450 --> 34:04.130]  I don't want to say.
[34:04.130 --> 34:04.790]  Oh.
[34:05.790 --> 34:09.090]  She was from the U.S. She was the... Northeast. She was from the Northeast.
[34:09.450 --> 34:09.970]  Yeah, that's enough.
[34:10.430 --> 34:10.670]  Yeah.
[34:11.750 --> 34:15.750]  Fuck it. I don't want to get too identifiable with her.
[34:20.700 --> 34:25.800]  Using the Internet without ExpressVPN is like having a first aid kit but not keeping it stocked up.
[34:26.200 --> 34:32.900]  Most of the time you'll probably be fine, but what if suddenly you get into a horrible accident and there's nothing in your first aid kit to help you stop the bleeding?
[34:33.440 --> 34:40.780]  That's interesting. I've never had an earthquake emergency kit in school, but I've never had a proper first aid kit.
[34:41.120 --> 34:48.560]  I assumed it was just like band-aids and stuff. I never thought it'd be used in a serious emergency, but I guess that makes sense.
[34:48.920 --> 34:49.880]  I just never considered it.
[34:50.320 --> 34:56.920]  Anyway, why you need a VPN is that every time you connect to an unencrypted network, cafe, hotels, airports,
[34:56.920 --> 35:03.120]  any hacker on that same network can gain access to your personal data, passwords, financial details, etc.
[35:03.800 --> 35:09.660]  It doesn't take much technical knowledge to hack someone. Just some cheap hardware is needed. A smart 12-year-old could do it.
[35:10.140 --> 35:15.780]  Your data is valuable. Hackers can make up to $1,000 per person selling personal info on the dark web.
[35:16.380 --> 35:22.620]  What's great about ExpressVPN is that they have an encrypted tunnel. It creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the Internet.
[35:22.620 --> 35:26.400]  Hackers can't steal your sensitive data. It's super secure.
[35:26.960 --> 35:31.380]  It'd take a hacker with a supercomputer over a billion years to get past ExpressVPN's encryption.
[35:32.100 --> 35:35.840]  It's easy to use. Fire up the app and click one button to get protected.
[35:36.360 --> 35:42.280]  It works on all your devices, phones, laptops, tablets, and more, so you can stay secure on the go.
[35:43.160 --> 35:49.160]  I love ExpressVPN as well because you can use it to access other countries' content libraries. It's awesome for that.
[35:49.160 --> 35:54.580]  As well as sometimes being able to watch events. I love the Smelling Bee. It's coming up soon.
[35:54.660 --> 35:58.160]  I don't know if it'll once again only be available in America or at least not available in Canada.
[35:58.440 --> 36:03.880]  I have to boot up ExpressVPN and be able to watch it because it's one of my favorite events of the year.
[36:03.880 --> 36:12.000]  So to secure your online data today by visiting expressvpn.com. That's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-v-p-n.com.
[36:12.360 --> 36:17.560]  And you can get an extra three months free via expressvpn.com.
[36:19.560 --> 36:22.040]  Take on the sun with gear built to last.

[38:30.180 --> 38:36.080]  a F*** Face Museum, a Shaman Hunter mini golf, and even more cool stuff to do that we're saving for attendees to experience.

[38:41.780 --> 38:48.180]  So head on over to www.rtxaustin.com to get more information about the event and buy your badge.
[38:50.560 --> 38:51.920]  One other story I have.
[38:52.980 --> 39:00.980]  We were at Lake Como. We got there a day early and so we stayed at this really nice hotel that had a fancy spa that they had just reopened.
[39:01.340 --> 39:05.300]  And it had like all of these different kind of like spa treatments you could try.
[39:05.900 --> 39:13.420]  Like there was this like room you walk in and you walk through ice cold water that's like up to your ankles or like a little above your ankles.
[39:13.640 --> 39:18.580]  And then you go into like hot water and then ice cold water and then hot water and you like follow this Zen path and shit.
[39:18.680 --> 39:22.700]  And then there's like there's a room full of ice that you just go in and freeze in for five minutes.
[39:22.800 --> 39:27.260]  Then you go get into a hot room and there's a room where you like dump buckets of hot or cold water on your head.
[39:27.320 --> 39:28.500]  Just all kinds of weird shit, right?
[39:28.700 --> 39:30.540]  And so Emily and I are just going through and doing it all.
[39:30.540 --> 39:35.240]  And then after we go through all the gimmicks, we're like, do you want to just hang out in the spa or in the sauna?
[39:35.460 --> 39:43.220]  And we're like, yeah, let's just get in a nice hot sauna and just fucking sweat out all the gross us and just fucking just relax.
[39:43.480 --> 39:48.720]  And so we get in the sauna and it's not super hot yet.
[39:48.720 --> 39:53.760]  And I'm like, OK, so I like click the on button to like flip it on and the lights come on.
[39:53.900 --> 39:55.860]  And I'm like, all right, it's going to start heating up now.
[39:56.180 --> 39:59.180]  And so we like lay down and get comfy and we're just laying there.
[39:59.460 --> 40:04.820]  And it's OK, but it's like it's like the least impressive sauna I've ever been in.
[40:05.140 --> 40:14.120]  And I'm just thinking about like why they would have such a mediocre sauna in such a nice hotel with all this other, all this other gimmicky shit.
[40:14.160 --> 40:16.560]  Right. And as we're laying there, we're just kind of like talking.
[40:16.560 --> 40:20.920]  And we both realize that we can hear this like somewhere off in the distance, this alarm going off.
[40:21.040 --> 40:22.360]  And it's like...
[40:23.700 --> 40:28.060]  We're like, somebody's day is ruined. And it just keeps going on and on forever.
[40:28.220 --> 40:30.560]  Like, man, I hope I hope this isn't like the end of the world or something.
[40:30.720 --> 40:32.520]  And like this is how we felt like 28 days later.
[40:32.820 --> 40:35.700]  This is how we find out, you know, and it just keeps going forever.
[40:35.880 --> 40:38.460]  And we're kind of joking about it because it's been going on for like five minutes.
[40:38.660 --> 40:43.260]  And then the front door swings open and some dude runs in and he goes, is everybody OK?
[40:43.460 --> 40:46.140]  Are you OK? And we're like, yeah, man, what's up?
[40:46.140 --> 40:48.600]  And he's like, oh, you hit the alarm button.
[40:49.140 --> 40:51.220]  We just make sure everything's OK.
[40:51.440 --> 40:54.240]  And he went and he turned off the alarm button and then the sauna turned on.
[40:57.640 --> 41:00.320]  We got in and I just immediately pulled the alarm.
[41:02.520 --> 41:10.140]  And we were sitting in a fucking in a cold ass sauna not working because it was shut down while there was an alarm blaring around the entire...
[41:12.940 --> 41:15.400]  And we couldn't hear it because we were in the sauna.
[41:18.040 --> 41:21.100]  So you didn't notice everything turn off the second you press that?
[41:21.580 --> 41:24.020]  Yeah, the second he pressed that, it got started. It got damn hot.
[41:24.140 --> 41:25.200]  And we're like, oh, this feels all right.
[41:29.540 --> 41:31.620]  I was it. So where was the button?
[41:31.860 --> 41:34.400]  And was it in the sauna? Was it outside? What is...
[41:34.400 --> 41:35.980]  No, it was in the sauna, just on the wall.
[41:36.680 --> 41:38.920]  Really? That's I feel like once again, sort on them.
[41:39.060 --> 41:40.820]  I feel like there should be more of a sign.
[41:41.240 --> 41:43.080]  How is it not marked with a huge sign?
[41:43.380 --> 41:45.340]  Yeah. How does that not constantly happen?
[41:45.340 --> 41:46.580]  I don't know. I don't speak Italian.
[41:47.580 --> 41:51.380]  Well, I mean, the color scheme usually like an exclamation mark or something.
[41:51.960 --> 41:55.640]  I didn't I didn't notice that. I just felt like I just felt like a thing to flip.
[41:55.900 --> 41:56.880]  I was like, yeah, this must be it.
[41:57.900 --> 41:59.520]  I wonder how often that happens.
[41:59.720 --> 42:03.700]  Like, does that guy just have to sprint across the hotel like every three days?
[42:04.100 --> 42:07.040]  I mean, by the by his reaction, it sounds like it hardly ever happens.
[42:07.200 --> 42:08.980]  Otherwise, he would have just strolled in casually.
[42:08.980 --> 42:16.120]  He looked stressed out and then then immediately like he hated me, which I get.
[42:16.300 --> 42:18.420]  Oh, he's been talking to the other lady, probably.
[42:19.060 --> 42:21.280]  Oh, my God. That is anyway.
[42:21.340 --> 42:23.220]  So that's that's my Italy trip other than.
[42:23.360 --> 42:24.180]  Oh, I love it.
[42:24.320 --> 42:25.340]  And let me tell you something.
[42:25.380 --> 42:29.080]  I saw all the greatest works of art and all anything you can think of.
[42:29.120 --> 42:31.400]  I saw and I got to see like private tours of it.
[42:31.400 --> 42:32.820]  I can see a private tour of the Sistine Chapel.
[42:32.920 --> 42:34.380]  It was amazing to see all this stuff.
[42:34.380 --> 42:41.520]  And all I've discovered is, man, are there a lot of pictures, a lot of paintings of Mary and the baby Jesus?
[42:42.580 --> 42:47.220]  Why didn't they paint anything else like babies for steps?
[42:47.700 --> 42:50.560]  Like surely it was a big deal with Jesus learned to walk, right?
[42:50.920 --> 42:56.640]  Or like first time he had solid food or like Jesus playing ball in the yard or like anything else.
[42:56.640 --> 43:04.860]  There are entire cities devoted to pictures of the Virgin Mary and the baby Jesus at the manger or like the day after when they have their first like mommy son photo.
[43:05.240 --> 43:06.380]  But like nothing else.
[43:06.840 --> 43:08.200]  I just like it's insane.
[43:08.520 --> 43:12.180]  Yeah. Why aren't more presidential portraits of them like having lunch?
[43:13.200 --> 43:13.660]  Yeah.
[43:15.080 --> 43:16.140]  Just why that moment?
[43:16.780 --> 43:18.960]  Like so much else happened in that dude's life.
[43:19.300 --> 43:20.380]  They could have drawn pictures of.
[43:20.940 --> 43:22.660]  And we're talking like old like art.
[43:22.660 --> 43:23.920]  Yeah, dude.
[43:24.280 --> 43:30.220]  Every museum you go to and you're like, you're like as the Virgin Mary was a baby Jesus.
[43:30.220 --> 43:33.620]  And over here is a baby Jesus with the Virgin Mary.
[43:33.660 --> 43:35.200]  I thought you said you didn't speak Italian.
[43:35.940 --> 43:37.480]  It's like back to back to back.
[43:37.720 --> 43:40.480]  Well, you know, it's I live there, man, for 10 days.
[43:40.880 --> 43:42.300]  I live there.
[43:42.560 --> 43:43.960]  I mean, visiting you live.
[43:44.080 --> 43:45.720]  You are practically Italian now.
[43:46.660 --> 43:50.780]  Do you think they they realized what they were doing or do you think they were all being original?
[43:50.780 --> 43:52.840]  Like these were all made independently.
[43:52.880 --> 43:56.760]  And then they had the big art show and they went, oh, no, they all got together.
[43:56.800 --> 43:58.340]  It's like, oh, no.
[43:58.760 --> 44:00.380]  You should have told me you were also drawing.
[44:01.460 --> 44:02.260]  Yeah, exactly.
[44:03.200 --> 44:10.160]  I just feel like if like if like they got all the Harry Potter fans got together and they all only drew the picture of the first book.
[44:10.420 --> 44:13.880]  And they're like, there's seven other books of shit you could draw from as.
[44:14.000 --> 44:14.620]  Yeah, I don't know.
[44:14.800 --> 44:15.280]  That's funny.
[44:15.520 --> 44:18.520]  I think that's a great analogy, though, because I wasn't really on board.
[44:18.520 --> 44:22.740]  I thought I'm like, I don't know, it's like church commissioned and it's just pictures of baby Jesus.
[44:22.960 --> 44:26.340]  But when you said Harry Potter all from the first book.
[44:26.760 --> 44:27.560]  Well, you think about it.
[44:27.560 --> 44:28.600]  It's like fandom, right?
[44:28.660 --> 44:31.240]  It's like it was the best story around back at the time.
[44:31.340 --> 44:35.020]  It was like Game of Thrones of of the the B.C.
[44:35.040 --> 44:35.640]  80s, right?
[44:35.660 --> 44:38.560]  It was like it was like the shit that was happening that everybody was invested in.
[44:38.660 --> 44:40.380]  All the fan fiction was about it.
[44:40.720 --> 44:44.400]  Everybody's writing, you know, that people are all the shipping.
[44:44.520 --> 44:45.640]  Everything is all about it.
[44:45.640 --> 44:49.660]  And it just like continued for so, so long.
[44:49.820 --> 44:51.880]  Like the staying power is phenomenal.
[44:52.340 --> 44:54.340]  For thousands of years, they were still drawn.
[44:54.420 --> 44:58.400]  They're still drawn pictures and and doing that shit.
[44:58.520 --> 45:00.740]  But it's just all of that same fucking scene.
[45:00.860 --> 45:02.000]  It's like so much else happened.
[45:02.420 --> 45:03.600]  Jesus was in his 30s.
[45:03.940 --> 45:04.400]  Like what?
[45:05.540 --> 45:08.340]  Why did Jesus eat lunch when he's 15 at school?
[45:08.500 --> 45:09.560]  Like where's that picture?
[45:09.900 --> 45:11.020]  Why didn't somebody paint that?
[45:13.060 --> 45:15.620]  Like Jesus hanging out with his friends in the backyard.
[45:16.220 --> 45:22.120]  Like having a horse race, having a donkey race with his buddy, Craig, or like anything, you know?
[45:22.660 --> 45:23.080]  Sure.
[45:23.440 --> 45:27.960]  I'm just thinking of a subgenre of like fan fiction around Jesus and like other.
[45:28.260 --> 45:32.900]  I never consider that like non-ironic like Jesus fan fic and media.
[45:32.900 --> 45:34.500]  That's what I would consider the Bible to be.
[45:34.540 --> 45:36.640]  It was written like 300 years after he died.
[45:37.080 --> 45:40.740]  I just I mean more in the context of like this is Twilight, but Jesus is there.
[45:40.740 --> 45:44.640]  Like the idea of like wanting to implement X-Men.
[45:45.680 --> 45:48.260]  Technically, Andrew, I think Jesus is in all of the stories.
[45:48.540 --> 45:49.120]  He's in all of us.
[45:49.420 --> 45:49.760]  I see.
[45:50.200 --> 45:50.940]  That's a great point.
[45:51.460 --> 45:51.600]  Yeah.
[45:52.220 --> 45:53.500]  Anyway, that was my big takeaway.
[45:53.920 --> 45:57.160]  I got to see stuff that was like, dude, Rome was fucking awesome.
[45:57.440 --> 46:00.780]  You get to go see stuff that you're like, you're like, oh, the Colosseum.
[46:00.840 --> 46:02.880]  Yeah, that's 3000 years older than Jesus.
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.360]  And you're like, holy shit, that's fucking old.
[46:05.780 --> 46:08.180]  And it's still there and you can still walk around it.
[46:08.180 --> 46:13.820]  And and you just think about like how much shit must have happened, how many interesting things must have happened.
[46:13.960 --> 46:18.940]  And then you go to all the museums and they tell you about four different, you know, four different dudes or events.
[46:19.200 --> 46:19.880]  And you're just like, man.
[46:20.300 --> 46:22.240]  And even then you just get like the small snapshot.
[46:22.940 --> 46:23.140]  Yeah.
[46:24.220 --> 46:29.400]  When you had your rivalry with that woman, did you do anything small but petty that gave you joy?
[46:29.480 --> 46:30.780]  Did you have like a small moment?
[46:31.420 --> 46:31.640]  Yeah.
[46:31.860 --> 46:32.640]  Well, fuck you.
[46:32.640 --> 46:40.080]  So like any time I would smile at her or wave or like open the door for her or anything, I just would on the inside.
[46:40.200 --> 46:41.880]  I'd be a little less sincere about it.
[46:42.520 --> 46:44.460]  Like I don't think she picked up on it.
[46:44.940 --> 46:48.440]  And that's that's I was such a subtle like it was for me internally.
[46:48.440 --> 46:55.980]  I'm not going to be rude to a lady, an older lady externally, of course.
[46:56.060 --> 46:56.780]  But it was on the inside.
[46:56.920 --> 46:59.740]  I was just like, I mean, I mean, like 60 percent.
[46:59.740 --> 47:03.940]  I like the idea of you doing something in real life, like a little bit of a smile, like raised eyebrows.
[47:04.420 --> 47:08.840]  But in your head, it's just like a furrowed brow and slightly closed mouth.
[47:09.180 --> 47:09.460]  Exactly.
[47:09.860 --> 47:13.460]  I'm like, on the inside, I'm like, I hope you don't have a nice day.
[47:16.700 --> 47:18.480]  Did you guys see this shit?
[47:18.680 --> 47:21.800]  The Corridor crew did the Jason Bourne fantasy trick.
[47:22.140 --> 47:24.320]  I think that was like a week after our episode came out.
[47:24.640 --> 47:29.120]  It's just more of our simulation breaking down and everything's just a coincidence.
[47:29.120 --> 47:30.280]  Yeah, I'm sure.
[47:30.380 --> 47:34.600]  I mean, I guarantee it's a coincidence because I doubt they heard it and then put a video together that.
[47:35.120 --> 47:36.020]  No, no.
[47:36.200 --> 47:44.040]  I read some I read some comments that people Gavin was on some of their videos one time and clearly Gavin set this up.
[47:44.120 --> 47:45.580]  So, Gavin, you're you're here.
[47:45.660 --> 47:46.340]  You can come clean.
[47:46.640 --> 47:48.380]  You can let everyone know that you did this.
[47:49.040 --> 47:50.040]  I mean, I'm friends with Ren.
[47:50.320 --> 47:50.840]  I like Ren.
[47:50.960 --> 47:53.660]  Apparently, his wife listens to F*** Face, which is nice.
[47:54.040 --> 47:54.760]  See, there you go.
[47:54.940 --> 47:55.860]  So just admit it.
[47:56.140 --> 47:57.380]  So simply admit it, Gavin.
[47:57.380 --> 47:58.080]  Nope.
[47:58.160 --> 47:59.740]  Nothing to do with me at all.
[47:59.740 --> 48:04.080]  I actually heard rumors that Gavin was inside the van that the guy was jumping into.
[48:05.480 --> 48:06.600]  True or false?
[48:06.840 --> 48:07.240]  Wow.
[48:07.600 --> 48:08.080]  Definitely false.
[48:10.020 --> 48:11.540]  Well, I haven't watched the video yet.
[48:11.580 --> 48:12.180]  How is it?
[48:12.920 --> 48:13.640]  I haven't watched it either.
[48:13.840 --> 48:14.600]  I just saw the thumbnail.
[48:16.900 --> 48:20.300]  It's just going to be them doing a way better job of it than we're going to do.
[48:20.340 --> 48:21.000]  Yeah, definitely.
[48:22.380 --> 48:22.780]  Undeniable.
[48:23.580 --> 48:24.360]  Oh, that's awesome.
[48:24.460 --> 48:24.960]  I like this.
[48:25.140 --> 48:26.320]  I don't know them personally.
[48:26.320 --> 48:28.100]  But I like their content.
[48:28.360 --> 48:30.620]  And we've always run in similar circles.
[48:31.380 --> 48:33.060]  Yeah, Ren is one of my favorite people online.
[48:33.700 --> 48:34.380]  Just like totally.
[48:34.640 --> 48:36.680]  One of the most enthusiastic people you'll ever meet.
[48:37.120 --> 48:37.500]  That's awesome.
[48:38.580 --> 48:40.820]  Geoff, I have a sports move I want to remind you.
[48:40.860 --> 48:43.360]  Since you're a sports influencer, I had an idea.
[48:43.880 --> 48:46.840]  I had a great, I think petty idea, that I'm very proud of.
[48:46.900 --> 48:47.780]  I didn't initiate on.
[48:48.780 --> 48:52.060]  But the NHL Draft Lottery happened a few days ago.
[48:52.060 --> 48:56.820]  And a really good player is expected to go in this upcoming draft.
[48:57.560 --> 48:58.860]  And the Chicago Blackhawks won.
[48:59.200 --> 49:00.980]  And I fucking hate the Blackhawks.
[49:01.280 --> 49:02.320]  They're a terrible, awful organization.
[49:02.760 --> 49:03.380]  Can't stand them.
[49:03.760 --> 49:05.220]  Just the worst in so many ways.
[49:05.600 --> 49:05.840]  Jeez.
[49:06.040 --> 49:09.920]  And I was reading a news story, like an hour after it happened,
[49:10.020 --> 49:13.960]  that they had sold like $2.5 million in season tickets.
[49:14.240 --> 49:17.560]  Like an hour after they had won the lottery to get this player.
[49:18.280 --> 49:19.800]  I think a great move.
[49:20.100 --> 49:21.900]  And I hadn't ever thought about this before.
[49:21.900 --> 49:22.820]  I don't know if it's possible.
[49:22.960 --> 49:24.420]  I didn't look into logistics of it fully.
[49:24.620 --> 49:26.040]  I did try, but the site was down.
[49:27.600 --> 49:31.300]  I think a great move would be to buy season tickets for teams you hate.
[49:31.900 --> 49:33.540]  And then sell them back to the fans.
[49:34.060 --> 49:35.040]  At an above average price.
[49:35.240 --> 49:36.580]  If the demand allows it.
[49:37.280 --> 49:40.160]  Like that's a thing I'm going to be actively looking to do.
[49:40.700 --> 49:42.260]  Like scalping for shitty teams?
[49:42.380 --> 49:42.940]  Sort of, yeah.
[49:43.020 --> 49:46.300]  But like buying season, I never considered buying season tickets.
[49:46.340 --> 49:48.580]  Yeah, but that's not scalping, is it?
[49:48.600 --> 49:50.700]  Well, no, because I'm buying the tickets from the team.
[49:50.700 --> 49:52.960]  But then just never going to the games.
[49:53.120 --> 49:53.640]  Oh.
[49:53.860 --> 49:54.960]  I'm only selling them.
[49:55.540 --> 49:59.680]  And so therefore, fans of that team would then have to pay me to see their team.
[49:59.880 --> 50:04.640]  And I feel like in a weird way that I'm getting like a one-up on the fans of that team.
[50:04.960 --> 50:09.400]  You just, you added a moral quandary to just scalping.
[50:09.860 --> 50:19.680]  Like you've just, you've somehow put sports anger into like the secondary market.
[50:19.680 --> 50:20.260]  Yeah.
[50:20.460 --> 50:24.540]  I don't, I'm not really sure what it accomplishes.
[50:24.640 --> 50:26.160]  This is what it accomplishes.
[50:26.340 --> 50:29.480]  I guess, would you sell the tickets for more or less than what?
[50:29.900 --> 50:30.440]  Oh, more.
[50:31.080 --> 50:32.300]  Okay, so you're just...
[50:32.300 --> 50:32.940]  Absolutely more than what I paid for.
[50:33.080 --> 50:33.420]  Well, no.
[50:33.940 --> 50:34.500]  But this is...
[50:34.500 --> 50:35.160]  No, hear me out.
[50:35.400 --> 50:35.660]  Well...
[50:35.660 --> 50:36.120]  Hear me out.
[50:36.460 --> 50:39.060]  I lost, my team lost the draft lottery.
[50:39.320 --> 50:40.580]  I'm really mad about it.
[50:40.820 --> 50:47.580]  But now fans of the Blackhawks have to pay a tax to me, a guy that hates their organization.
[50:48.480 --> 50:50.280]  I'm profiting off of their fandom.
[50:50.660 --> 50:52.940]  And that makes me feel okay about losing the draft.
[50:53.840 --> 50:58.280]  Now, now that we, now that you put it out, put it like that, I'm pretty sure it is scalping.
[51:00.160 --> 51:01.680]  How did he put it the first time?
[51:01.940 --> 51:09.320]  What if you, well, cause I was thinking like, before the pandemic, I was seriously considering buying a season ticket block to the Celtics.
[51:09.960 --> 51:15.580]  Figuring I could travel to seven or eight games and then anyone that I couldn't make, I'd just sell on like...
[51:16.640 --> 51:16.760]  Yeah.
[51:16.760 --> 51:17.580]  You're allowed to do that?
[51:18.760 --> 51:19.120]  Yeah.
[51:19.240 --> 51:19.700]  Yeah, why wouldn't I be?
[51:19.800 --> 51:20.020]  Absolutely.
[51:20.060 --> 51:20.240]  Oh yeah.
[51:20.440 --> 51:20.880]  I do that.
[51:21.000 --> 51:25.940]  I have season tickets to Austin FC and I sell the tickets that I can't go to the games to, yeah.
[51:26.120 --> 51:29.860]  But I would be buying them with the intention of going to most or all of them.
[51:29.900 --> 51:35.620]  And then if circumstances change, I have the, you know, the safety valve of being able to sell them, hopefully for an increased rate.
[51:36.420 --> 51:46.480]  It seems like it'd be a funnier gotcha if you could figure out a way to sell those tickets, but only tell them to people that hate the Blackhawks who are then going to...
[51:46.480 --> 51:47.120]  Yeah.
[51:47.280 --> 51:51.020]  Going to be, you know, like extroverted and nuisances.
[51:51.180 --> 51:54.220]  Yeah, like maybe sell them at a discount to the away team.
[51:54.580 --> 52:08.160]  That is the extension of that. If you were a James Bond-like billionaire villain, the move would definitely be to buy as many season tickets as you could and then either just not go or send opposing fans to every home game.
[52:08.720 --> 52:08.940]  Yeah.
[52:11.180 --> 52:13.260]  The company still makes all the money though.
[52:13.260 --> 52:19.560]  Yeah, but it's about you. It's about you lying to yourself to make you feel better about your sports situation.
[52:20.480 --> 52:20.860]  Interesting.
[52:21.360 --> 52:25.780]  None of it is logical. Like, that's the first thing you gotta get rid of when assessing any of these things.
[52:25.780 --> 52:29.680]  Yeah, I think that works way better on a grander scale, like if you buy a whole block.
[52:31.100 --> 52:38.040]  Because it wouldn't even... to be clear, like, I couldn't... if they're selling above what I bought them for, that's because of demand for...
[52:38.040 --> 52:39.140]  Market demand. Yeah.
[52:39.560 --> 52:44.640]  It's not me. I'm not purposely bumping, because if I did, then people just wouldn't buy them.
[52:45.360 --> 52:53.980]  But if market demand caters, which it generally does when there's excitement around a team that has potential, I just think it's a great penny move.
[52:54.260 --> 52:58.460]  Is there a team that you would do this with, Gavin? Do you have, like, a sports hate for someone?
[52:58.980 --> 52:59.780]  Oh, Arsenal, yeah.
[53:00.140 --> 53:02.700]  Oh, okay. Well, there you go. No hesitation.
[53:03.520 --> 53:04.900]  Well, I mean, every team's got a rival.
[53:05.660 --> 53:08.500]  Imagine if you were more successful in life than you currently are.
[53:08.500 --> 53:16.840]  And you were able to... there's, like, the big Premier League Cup. It's between Arsenal and Tottenham.
[53:17.340 --> 53:24.400]  And you were able to... and it's a 100,000-person stadium, and you were able to buy 50,000 Arsenal fan seats.
[53:24.720 --> 53:29.720]  And then just leave it empty, and it's just 50,000 Tottenham fans. And then just fucking cricket.
[53:30.400 --> 53:35.420]  And then when Arsenal inevitably beat Spurs, it's just complete silence for every goal.
[53:38.040 --> 53:38.520]  Boing.
[53:39.120 --> 53:46.200]  Cause it's actually like, I've been to games where the away turnout was so low that you could barely hear anyone over there.
[53:46.300 --> 53:53.100]  And it's not like everyone boos when a goal is scored. It's just quiet. Like, people just mainly get quiet.
[53:53.780 --> 53:59.900]  And it's a really funny sight to, like, hear the ball hit the net in a big stadium.
[53:59.900 --> 54:02.920]  And just people, like, you can hear the players going, yeah!
[54:07.200 --> 54:09.240]  That'd be great if Arsenal were playing.
[54:11.040 --> 54:13.460]  See, now you're on board. You're loving this fantasy.
[54:13.660 --> 54:14.760]  I'm back on board.
[54:16.080 --> 54:18.320]  Could I talk to you about the problem I'm having at the moment?
[54:18.900 --> 54:19.280]  Please.
[54:19.900 --> 54:23.200]  And I've talked in the slack about this, but...
[54:23.200 --> 54:27.380]  You know, as you know, I'm hounded by slightly weird house problems a lot of the time.
[54:28.080 --> 54:32.800]  I've had my carpet mushrooms and my sink mushrooms. Constant battle.
[54:34.740 --> 54:36.480]  And now I've got my slime.
[54:38.160 --> 54:38.600]  Slime?
[54:38.760 --> 54:40.160]  I mean, my slime face. The slime era.
[54:40.420 --> 54:40.940]  What is this?
[54:41.080 --> 54:41.520]  Oh my god.
[54:41.940 --> 54:44.520]  What is this shit? Where is this coming from?
[54:45.160 --> 54:49.500]  That is... you got the last of a season 2 starting in your house, is what you have.
[54:50.020 --> 54:51.180]  Yeah, I don't want to touch it.
[54:51.780 --> 54:52.460]  You shouldn't.
[54:52.740 --> 54:56.300]  Is it slimy? It looks like mold or...
[54:56.860 --> 54:58.040]  Oh, like fungus.
[54:58.540 --> 55:01.120]  Yeah, it's like translucent goo.
[55:02.360 --> 55:07.020]  You're gonna end up like Stephen King in Creepshow if you touch that. Do not touch that.
[55:07.400 --> 55:09.120]  Yeah, don't touch the meteor shit.
[55:11.900 --> 55:17.020]  Yeah, I don't know what to do about this. This is probably one for the audience to help out with. What am I doing with this slime?
[55:17.780 --> 55:23.340]  How would... have you tried power washing it? I would try power washing it. That'd be my first phase, I think.
[55:23.340 --> 55:28.100]  Well, yeah, I could wash it off, but isn't it more interesting to see how big the slime gets?
[55:28.600 --> 55:30.780]  Well, it is. I'm just... if you wanna...
[55:30.780 --> 55:32.300]  I thought we were looking for solutions.
[55:32.860 --> 55:35.880]  I didn't realize that's what we were doing with this. Okay, I'm sorry.
[55:36.160 --> 55:41.340]  I was looking up solutions, what it could possibly be, things to make it go away.
[55:41.580 --> 55:48.060]  I didn't realize that we were in a, well, let's see what this thing is and see how far it can go situation.
[55:48.540 --> 55:55.100]  When Geoff was in his crotch-rot phase, he didn't say, I wonder how far this will go. Let's just wait and see.
[55:55.420 --> 55:59.260]  Well, I don't have slime growing on my balls. I mean, it's not like, I don't think it's that urgent.
[56:00.260 --> 56:01.040]  It's growing on your balls.
[56:01.040 --> 56:04.400]  I mean, but you don't know what it is. You don't know how urgent it is.
[56:04.520 --> 56:10.160]  To me, this is how, um, like the original Super Mario Bros. movie, this is how, like, the Koopa World started.
[56:13.040 --> 56:14.100]  What do you mean?
[56:14.360 --> 56:17.060]  It's a slimy place, isn't it? Everything's, like, covered in goo in there.
[56:17.060 --> 56:19.420]  Dennis Hopper's, like, living in Slime World.
[56:19.780 --> 56:25.080]  So you think, like, if they do a zoom out, it would just be like in Men in Black where they keep zooming out or whatever?
[56:25.360 --> 56:27.940]  No, I'm not saying that this is a tiny city. I'm saying that this is the beginning.
[56:29.940 --> 56:31.060]  This is where it started.
[56:31.540 --> 56:34.020]  Have you checked on it recently? Is this a current photo?
[56:34.800 --> 56:36.780]  Oh, this is about two weeks ago. I haven't looked at it for a while.
[56:37.060 --> 56:38.900]  What? That's two weeks ago?
[56:38.900 --> 56:41.260]  Oh my god, go look at it. Go run out and look at it right now.
[56:41.320 --> 56:43.360]  Yeah, are we keeping tabs on this?
[56:43.860 --> 56:44.940]  I'll go right now.
[56:45.280 --> 56:45.920]  Yeah, go.
[56:45.920 --> 56:46.820]  Are you going to take a picture?
[56:47.340 --> 56:48.020]  Yeah, take a picture.
[56:48.200 --> 56:48.460]  Okay.
[56:49.700 --> 56:50.800]  I don't... I don't understand.
[56:50.800 --> 56:52.020]  Nick says it may already be too late.
[56:54.640 --> 57:00.840]  I mean, the reality is in another three weeks, it's going to be too hot in Texas for anything to survive.
[57:01.080 --> 57:01.340]  Yeah.
[57:01.440 --> 57:02.940]  And the fucking sun will kill it.
[57:03.080 --> 57:06.460]  I was really, like, looking up. I'm like, oh, I wonder what this could be.
[57:06.540 --> 57:10.920]  I'm searching, like, outdoor slime fungus growing on house. I'm, like, doing searches. What are the best ways out?
[57:11.400 --> 57:13.460]  And Gavin's like, no, I want to see what happens.
[57:13.860 --> 57:14.760]  Let's see what happens.
[57:16.220 --> 57:17.880]  It's fucking gross.
[57:17.900 --> 57:19.420]  I got a... I got a problem here, Doc.
[57:20.240 --> 57:25.180]  Let's see what happens. Do you want a treat? Nah, let's just... let's play it out. Let's see what's going on.
[57:25.400 --> 57:28.120]  If that was growing on my house, I would be taking care of it already.
[57:28.580 --> 57:28.980]  Yes.
[57:29.840 --> 57:31.940]  There's... I wouldn't not be taking care of it.
[57:32.300 --> 57:32.580]  Wow.
[57:32.800 --> 57:39.140]  I mean, if it starts heating up, you should cut that section of his wall off to preserve it inside. We got to see where this goes.
[57:39.340 --> 57:39.640]  Right.
[57:39.720 --> 57:40.560]  We got to remove the wall.
[57:40.880 --> 57:42.160]  Of course. Clearly.
[57:43.140 --> 57:43.540]  Obviously.
[57:43.540 --> 57:45.400]  How are you guys feeling, by the way?
[57:46.760 --> 57:47.200]  Tired.
[57:47.900 --> 57:48.100]  Yeah.
[57:49.380 --> 57:50.120]  Happy, I guess.
[57:50.120 --> 57:50.520]  Is that mostly it?
[57:51.180 --> 57:51.480]  Yeah.
[57:51.640 --> 57:51.820]  What?
[57:52.280 --> 57:52.940]  Oh, my God.
[57:53.500 --> 57:54.960]  I feel not good.
[57:55.000 --> 57:55.820]  Is that bigger?
[57:56.080 --> 57:56.660]  I can't tell.
[57:56.960 --> 57:57.400]  Yeah.
[57:57.560 --> 57:58.220]  Hold on.
[57:58.600 --> 57:59.520]  I'd say it is.
[57:59.800 --> 58:00.620]  I think it looks about the same.
[58:01.260 --> 58:03.960]  I think it looks a lot darker. I think it's more established.
[58:04.360 --> 58:06.220]  It looks more evil at the bottom.
[58:06.360 --> 58:08.120]  Yeah, the bottom's a lot more evil.
[58:08.580 --> 58:08.900]  Yeah, 100%.
[58:08.900 --> 58:10.680]  Yeah, you can see the darkness spreading.
[58:10.680 --> 58:11.780]  This is how strange...
[58:11.780 --> 58:13.060]  This is season one of Stranger Things.
[58:13.880 --> 58:15.520]  Oh, it's like to the upside down?
[58:16.020 --> 58:16.340]  Yeah.
[58:16.880 --> 58:18.480]  It's definitely getting...
[58:18.480 --> 58:21.860]  It looks like it's eating away at the bottom of your wall, maybe.
[58:23.240 --> 58:24.860]  It does look like it's eating.
[58:25.520 --> 58:26.480]  Oh, I should move.
[58:26.680 --> 58:30.580]  I'm so excited for the comments on this, where people are going to be like,
[58:30.620 --> 58:31.740]  You need to sell your house immediately.
[58:31.800 --> 58:33.340]  I've seen this before.
[58:33.700 --> 58:34.840]  And it's killer mold.
[58:35.200 --> 58:38.120]  And you need to burn it down.
[58:38.420 --> 58:39.660]  That mold has priors.
[58:39.660 --> 58:41.020]  You need to get out of there.
[58:42.440 --> 58:45.880]  None of it is that important or that exciting, it's just some mold on a home.
[58:46.440 --> 58:50.920]  It's just like, this is two weeks before the house in Poltergeist sucked itself up into another dimension.
[58:54.360 --> 58:55.540]  Alright, well I'll keep it on it.
[58:55.980 --> 58:58.380]  Yeah, well you're going to, there's concern...
[58:58.920 --> 59:03.600]  There's concern the heat, when it heats up over the next few weeks, will just naturally kill this.
[59:03.640 --> 59:07.480]  And if you want to see where it goes, what lengths are you willing to go to protect this?
[59:08.020 --> 59:08.800]  I could bag it.
[59:09.280 --> 59:09.700]  Yeah.
[59:09.980 --> 59:10.400]  No!
[59:11.040 --> 59:11.240]  Yeah.
[59:11.400 --> 59:12.400]  You're going to bag it?
[59:12.540 --> 59:15.720]  Or like, tape transparent plastic around it?
[59:16.080 --> 59:22.000]  The toothbrush gagging guy with the cold is going to bag the slime wall, and that'll be okay?
[59:22.200 --> 59:23.580]  That sounds so gross.
[59:24.280 --> 59:24.500]  Huh.
[59:26.140 --> 59:29.940]  You were unfazed by that, and I can't believe that you weren't like, yeah, I'll bag it.
[59:30.220 --> 59:32.240]  You did a really good job of matching photos.
[59:32.360 --> 59:34.800]  Did you attempt that, or is that just naturally the photo you took?
[59:34.800 --> 59:38.420]  I just sort of remembered taking it there, just took it again.
[59:38.820 --> 59:39.580]  That's really good.
[59:39.800 --> 59:40.160]  Thanks!
[59:44.340 --> 59:45.060]  It's a problem.
[59:45.480 --> 59:47.280]  I have new vocabulary I found out, by the way.
[59:47.460 --> 59:47.740]  Yeah?
[59:48.020 --> 59:54.080]  Yeah, like if ever we're, like Dan was here recently, we're deciding what to eat every day and what to have for lunch and stuff,
[59:54.580 --> 59:57.480]  and if he suggested something, I'd be like, yeah, that's like a seventh round pick.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.320]  And I just like the way it sounds, and it's Andrew's go-to.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.720]  But do you understand what that means?
[01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:18.010]  Neither did Dan, but just based on the context I gave him.
[01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:23.050]  You were explaining it to Dan?
[01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:26.110]  The only thing I was saying was it sounds like a seventh round pick.
[01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:30.870]  And then what does he infer from that, do you think?
[01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:38.210]  I think just from my tone, I could have said anything and he would have known I wasn't fussed about having jersey bikes again or whatever.
[01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:43.470]  By the time this is out, all of our stuff will have been out and everything or whatever,
[01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:50.870]  but at the time of this recording, the Rock Not Rock Draft has come out a week ago, or just before the Condor Man release.
[01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:58.230]  Thoughts on how the Rock Not Rock Draft, with a little bit of time sort of between you and the fan reaction,
[01:00:58.330 --> 01:00:59.590]  any thoughts on Rock Not Rock Draft?
[01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:04.350]  I saw a lot of comment leavers who are pretty happy with Crack as my first pick.
[01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:07.230]  Maybe I was onto something.
[01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:13.470]  I said it to Eric at the time and I think it's still true. I think it's probably the best piece of content we've ever made.
[01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:21.130]  I feel like the Crack Rock is the Johnny Manziel of the Rock pick.
[01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:24.310]  It's flashy on the board, you feel really good about it in the offseason,
[01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:26.930]  but if you were to put your team to the test, it's going to fall apart.
[01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:28.490]  You don't want Crack Rock on the roster.
[01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:31.230]  Can you say what you just said again, but in English?
[01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:37.250]  Well, Johnny Manziel. He's a football player.
[01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:42.390]  People like it. People like the pick.
[01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:46.710]  I think it's important to remember going forward.
[01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:53.210]  I don't think we have any drafts lined up, but if we do more, which I assume we will, it's a good data point.
[01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:54.850]  Oh wow, there's a poll done.
[01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:58.210]  There were a couple polls. Now, here's the thing.
[01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:08.730]  If there was just one poll supporting Gavin in his winning here, then whatever.
[01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:13.970]  The poll on the subreddit overwhelmingly Gavin.
[01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:18.490]  The poll on the YouTube channel overwhelmingly Gavin.
[01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:23.130]  There's 934 votes on the subreddit poll.
[01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:27.970]  5.5K votes on the YouTube poll.
[01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:30.430]  Gavin with 52%.
[01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:31.910]  Holy shit.
[01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:38.090]  Gavin, you far and away are... I mean, here's the thing.
[01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:39.750]  It doesn't matter what they voted for.
[01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:42.090]  It truly doesn't matter.
[01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:45.870]  But it doesn't matter what the audience thinks.
[01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:48.250]  I think they decide for the...
[01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:51.050]  Yeah, I feel like we have to respect the final opinion of the audience.
[01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:55.670]  I'm just letting you know, I don't think I'm ever going to do that.
[01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:57.130]  Well, I know you won't.
[01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:59.810]  Nick won the first one, right? We decided that?
[01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:03.310]  Gavin definitely won the second one.
[01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:06.530]  I think that's one to Nick, one to me.
[01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:09.250]  And I wonder what Maul will say.
[01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:13.070]  I'm so curious about the Maul draft. It's so different.
[01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:15.630]  People are going to think that it's like...
[01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:19.610]  People are going to just be so ready for another Rock Not Rock.
[01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:22.290]  And it's just us being so happy about it.
[01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:25.170]  Yeah, and all the issues...
[01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:29.850]  My favorite part of it is the people who have determined that they have a better way to run the draft.
[01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:32.330]  Which is totally fine. You may have a better...
[01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:35.830]  All I can say to that is, you and your friends should do that draft.
[01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:37.690]  And have the best fucking fun.
[01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:40.670]  And just enjoy it and have so much fun doing it.
[01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:43.330]  Because they are a ton of fun. They're just a ton of fun to do.
[01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:46.830]  But if you had issues with the way we ran the Rock Not Rock draft...
[01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:49.630]  Those same... I mean, it's the exact same thing in the Maul draft.
[01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:52.330]  So just go in forewarned.
[01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:57.030]  Although I gotta say, I think the Maul draft is just as good in a different way.
[01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:59.030]  It's so good. It's so good.
[01:03:59.170 --> 01:04:00.930]  But man, Gavin, congratulations.
[01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:03.410]  These are crazy though. Look at it.
[01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:05.690]  It's like everyone else is second place almost.
[01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:08.090]  It's weird. It's like...
[01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:10.450]  Especially that Spotify one.
[01:04:11.830 --> 01:04:14.970]  Nick and Eric and Geoff almost have the exact same amount.
[01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:17.930]  There's one name you're lacking. You missed there.
[01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:21.330]  Well, you clearly lost. I was trying not to...
[01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:29.190]  You know, I think if people voted with their minds instead of their hearts,
[01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:32.830]  saying I was the downer on the picks, I think I would have a higher percentage of the vote.
[01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:35.970]  That's what I think.
[01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:40.310]  I think people need to start thinking logically and not emotionally in these drafts.
[01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:42.670]  I gotta agree with Andrew.
[01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:50.090]  I think it's disrespectful that Geoff, he had the second biggest killer on the board for anybody,
[01:04:50.290 --> 01:04:52.130]  and he's not getting the respect it deserves.
[01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:53.230]  Oh, it's fine.
[01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:03.150]  I'm just happy that the content exists.
[01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:07.530]  We need to, after this, probably arrange the next Office Day,
[01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:12.090]  because we're getting to the point where all of our supplemental that we've been sat on for months is going to be out.
[01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:16.930]  Yeah. I mean, we discussed maybe watching the Dracula movie.
[01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:20.310]  Somebody mentioned that we had said we were going to watch Day of the Dolphin,
[01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:23.610]  that movie about how George C. Scott trains a dolphin to kill the president.
[01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:27.210]  We got more Slobby Joes we could do.
[01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:29.230]  I don't know what the next draft would be,
[01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:35.490]  but I feel like there's going to be a rich tapestry of drafting in our future.
[01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:40.170]  I mean, if you pick the next movie, we're almost snake-drafting movies to watch, right?
[01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:42.290]  Because you had the last pick as well.
[01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:43.670]  Oh, yeah.
[01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:47.450]  I also don't have to have the next movie pick. We can watch whatever you guys want to.
[01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:48.650]  I just want to watch more movies with you.
[01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.210]  Same.
[01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:52.390]  Geoff, did you suggest recently having a clock?
[01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:55.330]  Yeah, Slopper Clock.
[01:05:56.030 --> 01:06:01.230]  Yeah, I said we should make a clock that's just empty, but it just says Slopper Clock at 11.15.
[01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:08.150]  As soon as you said that, I was imagining the lobby of a big office building with all the different time zone clocks.
[01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:14.430]  And you could have a panel of four clocks, and on each time zone it would have the correct indication for Slopper Clock.
[01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:17.870]  Like Tokyo, it's going to be London.
[01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:22.150]  There's no numbers on it, it just went Slopper Clock, it just says it's time.
[01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:29.010]  Yeah, the London one would be like 7 in the morning or something.
[01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:31.310]  That's a great idea.
[01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:38.750]  Oh, that's a great idea, like highlight what if every clock was colored differently to reflect what Slopper Clock was for that clock.
[01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:39.230]  Yeah.
[01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:40.650]  Yeah, I love it.
[01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:41.570]  That's great.
[01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:42.570]  Oh, man.
[01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:44.970]  Andrew, are you taking Pax Lovid?
[01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:45.650]  No.
[01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:46.070]  What?
[01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:47.610]  Pax Lovid?
[01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:49.550]  Pax Lovid? It's like a COVID treatment?
[01:06:49.790 --> 01:06:50.130]  No.
[01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:50.690]  The pills you take?
[01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:50.970]  No.
[01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:56.290]  They say, you might want to look into it.
[01:06:56.850 --> 01:06:59.650]  They say, I called my doctor and they gave it to me for free.
[01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:03.990]  So, you take it for like five days, like in the morning and at night.
[01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:07.710]  But they say one side effect of it is that it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
[01:07:07.850 --> 01:07:17.510]  And I just don't know anybody else that's taken it to confirm, but I just wanted to see because this is, it is the most understated side effect ever.
[01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:20.610]  It is the most intense bad taste and it has been in my mouth.
[01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.130]  I will not go away.
[01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:25.130]  It's like sour and bitter at the same time.
[01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:26.870]  And it's everything I take.
[01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:31.110]  It's like the opposite of like, you know how when people were like losing their sense of smell and taste when they had COVID?
[01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:34.670]  It's like now my sense of smell and taste has been replaced by sour, bitter.
[01:07:35.610 --> 01:07:37.390]  Like you wish you could lose your sense of smell?
[01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:38.570]  Yeah, a little bit.
[01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:39.150]  A little bit.
[01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:40.370]  It's been so interesting.
[01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:42.590]  Have you tried to eat anything overpowering?
[01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:43.950]  Like a big garlic or something?
[01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:47.650]  Uh, no, maybe I should try to eat a big garlic tonight.
[01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:50.410]  Don't look into that.
[01:07:51.030 --> 01:07:52.910]  When's the last time you had a big garlic, Geoff?
[01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:54.350]  It's been a minute.
[01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:58.030]  You know, garlic gives me the worst of the farts.
[01:07:58.570 --> 01:08:00.110]  We've determined, Emily and I have, yeah.
[01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:05.050]  That like, if you take a, sometimes we take a clove of garlic and cut it in half.
[01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:07.650]  And then you pour a little olive oil and some salt on it.
[01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:12.010]  And then you just let it roast in the oven for like, I don't know, half hour, 45 minutes.
[01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:14.330]  And then when you pull it out, it's like soft and chewy.
[01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:15.910]  It's like, almost like creamy.
[01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:17.970]  And there's like garlic juice everywhere.
[01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:23.950]  And if I eat like that entire clove of garlic, which I could do, I gotta sleep outside.
[01:08:24.490 --> 01:08:32.970]  It's like, as a matter of fact, when, you know, someday we've talked about how we're gonna record the episode in the port-a-potty together.
[01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:37.750]  I was going to try to eat like three cloves of that garlic the night before.
[01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:42.630]  So that when I come in and we get locked in, it's just, it's just a non-stop onslaught.
[01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:47.710]  I just want to make it as torturous as possible.
[01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:53.050]  Is it smell and loud? Or is it just loud? What are we talking here?
[01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:56.070]  Like, what's the combination of, is it forceful and odorous?
[01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:58.070]  Smell. Smell. Just smell.
[01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:00.250]  Just like the worst, most heinous smelling thing.
[01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:05.510]  Just roasted garlic. Eat a bunch of roasted garlic tonight and see what happens.
[01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:08.270]  Man, speaking of smell, Eric, where's our can of disgusting shit?
[01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:12.770]  I don't know. I will get it for the next office day.
[01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:15.250]  Our can of disgusting shit.
[01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:18.010]  What a description.
[01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:19.890]  Cause we should get that on the calendar.
[01:09:20.310 --> 01:09:21.610]  Yeah, definitely. For sure.
[01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:23.610]  Yeah, don't we have to dig a six foot hole too?
[01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:27.250]  You should, yeah. It's been about a year since the beam hole.
[01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:29.070]  Jackhammer?
[01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:36.090]  Yeah, we were gonna dig a six foot hole with a jackhammer and then we were gonna put a USB drive with us talking about it at the bottom of it.
[01:09:36.230 --> 01:09:36.650]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:39.990]  We'll get all this on the calendars.
[01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.450]  I never got one of those Falcon signs. Did you guys get one?
[01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:42.970]  No.
[01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:47.430]  No, I haven't seen it come through. I'll have to talk with merch. It's very weird.
[01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:50.590]  Yeah, I think it came and went before I didn't even know it.
[01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:53.430]  Well, the Falcon took it, so it's fine. Oh, yeah, it sold out immediately.
[01:09:54.210 --> 01:09:56.890]  Goddamn. Maybe we should have stopped raising our number.
[01:09:57.210 --> 01:10:03.270]  Yeah, maybe we could go back and do like a second run of Falcon signs and scrumping signs or something, because I see people ask for them a lot.
[01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:06.850]  That's a good idea. Okay, I'll poke at it, see what's up.
[01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:10.210]  I'm not trying to rush you to the end. I'm giving you your...
[01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:11.250]  Your turn.
[01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:14.310]  Your over-experience clearance, so...
[01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.490]  Yeah.
[01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:18.770]  Hey, Gav, how did you feel about the coronation?
[01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:21.010]  That's a great question.
[01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.810]  Could I be honest with you?
[01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:22.530]  Yeah.
[01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:25.690]  I just read about it in the news the next day. I had no idea it was happening.
[01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:35.550]  I was fortunate enough to be in London for it, sitting in the Admirals Club at Heathrow.
[01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:40.650]  Yeah, apparently all the British people were supposed to do some sort of... I don't know, what was it?
[01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.750]  They wanted everyone to like...
[01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:43.730]  What?
[01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:46.630]  Swear fealty to the new king in some way.
[01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:49.110]  Either way, I didn't know it was happening. I missed it.
[01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.210]  Did you not swear fealty to your king yet?
[01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:51.950]  No.
[01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.790]  Aren't you required to?
[01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:53.430]  Do you have to file it in?
[01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:54.210]  Yes.
[01:10:54.210 --> 01:10:55.690]  It's like registering for select service.
[01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:56.710]  I'll get that on the calendar too.
[01:10:57.770 --> 01:11:01.690]  You gotta get out of the post office when you're 13, 18, and swear fealty to the king.
[01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:06.430]  I'll do it later.
[01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:09.390]  I'll get the next one.
[01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:12.970]  Yeah, you can start now. You can prepare. You'll be ready for the next one.
[01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:16.870]  Express post. What about the sticks? Have you sent the controller sticks yet?
[01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:20.130]  No, I'm waiting for Geoff to give me the thing he wants to send me.
[01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:24.890]  Oh man, I need to get that to you. It's just those video games I bought for Andrew a year ago. I need to get them to him.
[01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:27.290]  Alright, I'll tell you what. I'm putting a hard cut off on it.
[01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:27.930]  Okay.
[01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.830]  I'll check my front porch a week from today.
[01:11:31.450 --> 01:11:37.370]  Well, let me get COVID clear, and then as soon as I'm clear, I'll drive over and drop those games off.
[01:11:37.730 --> 01:11:38.230]  Alright, fair play.
[01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:39.150]  Alright.
[01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:40.530]  This was fun.
[01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.490]  It was good.
[01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:41.930]  I missed you guys.
[01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:42.870]  It's good to be back.
[01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:45.070]  Oh man, I missed you guys. Are we doing this again next week?
[01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:46.370]  I believe so.
[01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:53.610]  Gavin, do you think you could do us a favor and come down with COVID between now and then so you don't feel left out? We don't want you to feel left out.
[01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:54.590]  I'll do my best.
[01:11:55.330 --> 01:11:59.710]  I appreciate it. Hey, before we leave, I should tell you guys, guess what I ate for lunch today?
[01:12:00.570 --> 01:12:00.930]  Pastrami?
[01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:03.550]  Yeah, I ate a pastrami sandwich.
[01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:04.250]  Pastrami?
[01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:09.910]  Yeah, I ordered it. And not only did I order one, I ordered the pastrami sandwich, the one that made me throw up.
[01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.710]  Oh, wow.
[01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:13.450]  Well, it's been over a year now, right?
[01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:25.750]  Yeah, and it was fine. You know, I think that the new one that I eat is better at the other place, but it was fine. I didn't have any icks or anything the whole time.
[01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:26.390]  That's great.
[01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:31.450]  Yeah, so I'm pretty happy. I think I've climbed that mountain.
[01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:33.150]  And where are we on corndogs?
[01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:37.250]  Oh man, I can't eat any more corndogs because I said I wasn't gonna.
[01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:38.770]  No, I said no.
[01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:40.270]  No cravings?
[01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:49.710]  Yeah, well, there's been some confusion. There's like an Asian hot dog place over... actually by that new hot pot place I told you about.
[01:12:50.150 --> 01:12:56.170]  And they have some crazy corndogs that are like crazy Japanese corndogs that seem pretty interesting.
[01:12:56.410 --> 01:13:02.030]  But I just don't know. I feel like the line gets blurry and I don't want to cross it without realizing it, so I've just been staying away.
[01:13:02.570 --> 01:13:05.130]  But I'm a little bummed because some of them look kind of neat.
[01:13:07.190 --> 01:13:08.490]  That's such a strict rule.
[01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.770]  Listen, man.
[01:13:11.150 --> 01:13:12.510]  Do they call them corndogs?
[01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:13.490]  Yeah, some of them.
[01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:17.690]  Look, I gotta be very strict with me.
[01:13:18.330 --> 01:13:26.430]  Like, if I start wavering on corndogs and I'm like, you know, it's a music festival. Only corndogs at music festivals.
[01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:29.290]  This is how I become an alcoholic again, right?
[01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:33.850]  You're like, I'll just have one shot of whiskey and the next thing you know, I'm dead in the ditch somewhere.
[01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:38.290]  So I gotta be strong against the corndog urge.
[01:13:38.290 --> 01:13:40.870]  That happens with sodas and energy drinks.
[01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:42.730]  You're like, I only drink them at the office.
[01:13:42.930 --> 01:13:46.230]  And then we had all of those energy drinks for, like, face jams.
[01:13:46.330 --> 01:13:50.930]  So you drank some of all of them and then you're like, and now I'm gonna have a Red Bull.
[01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:53.590]  And it's like, don't do this. Stop doing this.
[01:13:54.030 --> 01:14:01.510]  I think what's interesting with Geoff, though, is that when I think of what his code is, it's not saluting and no corndogs.
[01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:04.790]  Like, those are the life that is... you're a unique individual.
[01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:07.490]  I don't think there's anyone else that those are like the lines.
[01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:09.190]  No corndogs and the saluting.
[01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:14.150]  I just don't think a journey has ever directly started with someone eating a corndog and ending up in a ditch.
[01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:16.730]  Well, listen, slippery slope.
[01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:17.410]  Yeah.
[01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:26.930]  And also, I've been told, I haven't confirmed it myself, but I've been told by some of the comment leavers that I can salute as of 2008.
[01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.650]  They changed the rules.
[01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:29.430]  So I need to look and see if that's real or not.
[01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:31.910]  Because if it is, I'll salute the shit out of that flag.
[01:14:33.130 --> 01:14:35.490]  I'd be so fucking excited to be able to do that again. You have no idea.
[01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:40.630]  Oh, God, by the way, I know I just keep rolling, but I just haven't talked to you guys in so long.
[01:14:40.770 --> 01:14:45.490]  I ran into the most lovely comment leaver at the Trader Joe's the other day.
[01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:49.490]  And he was working there and we had the nicest little conversation about F-Face.
[01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:52.570]  So shout out to Robert at Trader Joe's.
[01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:53.490]  He was a nice guy.
[01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.610]  What did he bring up?
[01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:55.850]  He likes the podcast.
[01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:57.750]  Andrew's a thing, you know.
[01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:59.450]  Usual stuff.
[01:14:59.910 --> 01:15:00.650]  Yeah, usual stuff.
[01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:06.650]  Every conversation with a stranger is love the podcast and then a question about Andrew.
[01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:08.050]  Andrew's not real though, right?
[01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:09.990]  People trying to get behind the curtain on Andrew.
[01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:14.470]  Like, I don't know any more than you do. I promise.
[01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:17.650]  I love those conversations so much.
[01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:18.190]  I do too.
[01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:23.070]  Being able to talk with just random people in the world about this Canadian I know is magic.
[01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:29.950]  It really is like when somebody comes up to you on the street and mentions F-Face.
[01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:33.030]  It really is like saying a secret handshake.
[01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:37.870]  It's like saying, hey, I'm a member of a club where we all speak the same language.
[01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:39.470]  And we all have the same interests.
[01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:42.210]  It was like back in the 90s, 2000s.
[01:15:44.210 --> 01:15:47.510]  You could be into all kinds of stuff, right?
[01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:53.250]  But if you met somebody and they also liked the Beastie Boys, you knew they were like, oh, they're okay.
[01:15:56.250 --> 01:15:58.770]  That's a big enough commonality that I could be okay with this person.
[01:15:58.970 --> 01:16:06.710]  I feel like when you meet somebody and they mention that they're a comment leaver, it's like you just like instantly all your guards down a little bit.
[01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:07.950]  And you're like, oh, okay, I know this person.
[01:16:08.170 --> 01:16:13.770]  Yeah, I've talked about it before, but it immediately eliminates a chance for me to suck at small talk.
[01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:18.450]  And we're talking about something that's real and that we both know about.
[01:16:18.690 --> 01:16:19.270]  Great. Love it.
[01:16:19.730 --> 01:16:20.550]  Well, should we kill it?
[01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:22.090]  I think we should.
[01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:22.670]  Yeah.
[01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:23.650]  Well, yeah.
[01:16:23.890 --> 01:16:24.930]  Do it again next week.
[01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:25.750]  No, no.
[01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:26.330]  The episode.
[01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:26.650]  Yeah.
[01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:27.290]  Of course.
[01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:28.950]  Okay, well, this is that then.
[01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:30.770]  Podcast is over.
[01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:42.870]  This is the post pleasantries where we tell you that, hey, if you really do like f***face, if you like to listen to it, even with a semblance of enthusiasm,
[01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:48.290]  it sure would be lovely if you would tell some people about it.
[01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:54.990]  These kind of podcasts, they live or die based on the like word of mouth for some reason.
[01:16:55.170 --> 01:16:56.410]  But that's just the way it is.
[01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:56.910]  My hands are tied.
[01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.610]  I don't understand it.
[01:16:57.870 --> 01:17:08.870]  But I know that if you tell people about f***face and then if they like f***face and then they watch f***face or listen to f***face and then they tell somebody about f***face, then sort of like the last of us, seven to ten years from now, we'll destroy the world.
[01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:10.050]  And that's kind of where we're headed.
[01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:13.370]  So give us all the stars and we'll see you next week.
[01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:16.590]  And we'll see you at RTX July 7th through 9th.
[01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:18.510]  RTXAustin.com to get tickets.
[01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:19.850]  Come to the f***face museum.
[01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:20.310]  Wow.
[01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:28.550]  I saw some people say that the one where we immediately start talking about alter egos and Errol and stuff is quite a good entry point.
[01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:32.270]  I don't know if that's true, but a lot of people said I would pick this one to show to a friend.
[01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:34.490]  Yeah, a lot of people are like, even people I meet.
[01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:38.370]  I had to make somebody, I ran into somebody in Italy who was like, oh, what have you been up to?
[01:17:38.410 --> 01:17:39.930]  And I go, oh, I do this podcast f***face.
[01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:42.090]  And he's like, oh, well, I don't really listen to podcasts.
[01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:43.910]  And I was like, you have to promise me you'll listen to it.
[01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.630]  Just one episode.
[01:17:45.010 --> 01:17:46.410]  He's like, oh, okay.
[01:17:46.810 --> 01:17:50.010]  Some people, if they're on the fence, they don't think they like podcasts.
[01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:52.010]  Let them know they do.
[01:17:52.170 --> 01:17:53.170]  You do like podcasts.
[01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.970]  You love them.
[01:17:54.010 --> 01:17:54.870]  You just don't know it yet.
[01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:55.850]  Jesus Christ.
[01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:57.230]  Open your f***ing ears.
[01:17:57.330 --> 01:17:57.910]  They're great.
[01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:02.350]  How do they feel about drafts, though?
[01:18:02.690 --> 01:18:04.530]  How do they feel about the tuxedo?
[01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:07.590]  We had so many angles.
[01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:09.370]  You like cookbooks?
[01:18:09.570 --> 01:18:10.590]  That's what I've been up to.
[01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:13.250]  Okay, bye.
[01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:14.330]  Bye.
[01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:15.650]  Hey, guys.
[01:18:15.810 --> 01:18:19.130]  Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of f***face.
[01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:21.310]  Poochie needs to return to his home planet.
[01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:22.850]  How do you spell Geoff?
[01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:24.530]  Rise of the robot people.
[01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:26.410]  Which side do you sleep on?
[01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:28.070]  Cosmic Crisp loves us.
[01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:30.470]  And, once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:33.430]  All that and more on next week's episode of f***face.
