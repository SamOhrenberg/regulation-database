[00:09.950 --> 00:17.310]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast, starring in an agneg order,
[00:18.470 --> 00:32.070]  we got Frosty, we got Ramrod, we got a regulation guy, we got Gooch Pooch and yours truly T-Bone.
[00:32.670 --> 00:38.170]  Welcome to the podcast. You are called a comment leaver or a regulation listener. That's the
[00:38.170 --> 00:43.070]  out of the way. Hello, everyone. God help anyone who made this the first episode.
[00:45.690 --> 00:50.570]  Are you good at scooping ice cream, Gavin? As Ram Scoop, I feel like that's your thing,
[00:50.630 --> 00:55.490]  like that's your move. You're a scooper guy. I actually don't. I've never been one. I never
[00:55.490 --> 01:00.330]  owned a scooper. I've always just done like a dessert spoon and had some really messy sort
[01:00.330 --> 01:05.870]  of like ice cream chunks. Really? Have you bent a lot of spoons over the course of your life?
[01:08.170 --> 01:12.010]  You should really get an ice cream scooper. I feel like as Ram Scoop, that that's kind of part
[01:12.010 --> 01:15.990]  of your thing. Oh, that's a great idea. And you get the fun little button. You hit the button.
[01:16.090 --> 01:20.170]  It's great. The ice cream comes. I wonder what the most premium ice cream. You know how you can
[01:20.170 --> 01:25.450]  get those sort of overengineered cork removers, the electric ones where you just hit a button
[01:25.450 --> 01:29.950]  and it kind of does all the work. I wonder if there's a completely automated ice cream scooper.
[01:30.490 --> 01:34.890]  You know what there should be? What would make it even better? Because I've seen ice cream scoops,
[01:34.930 --> 01:37.830]  by the way, I don't know about you guys. I've used them a lot in my life. A lot of times they don't
[01:37.830 --> 01:43.530]  work. Like if the ice cream is frozen, it's still hard as dicks to get ice cream out. So one tip I've
[01:43.530 --> 01:47.810]  learned over the years that I think my grandpa probably taught me or something is you like run
[01:47.810 --> 01:52.630]  the scoop over under hot water for a little while. So it like heats it up. So then it goes into the
[01:52.630 --> 01:56.390]  ice cream a little bit easier. It'd be cool if you could get an overly technologically advanced
[01:56.390 --> 02:03.330]  one that also has a heating element. There are ice cream scoops. I'm looking them up. I'm looking at
[02:03.330 --> 02:09.470]  a couple different ones like Williams Sonoma type stuff where it's taking like the heat from your
[02:09.470 --> 02:16.490]  hand to like heat up the rest of the spoon to cut through the ice cream. It's it's again heat
[02:16.490 --> 02:21.950]  conductive liquid in the handle takes advantage of the natural warmth of your hand to facilitate
[02:21.950 --> 02:28.230]  smooth scooping and provide easy release. I don't know if I want to pay to have something use my
[02:28.230 --> 02:35.610]  own heat. Like I made that heat. What am I paying for? You're paying to have access to that heat in
[02:35.610 --> 02:41.490]  new and exciting ways. I might as well shove my fingers into the ice cream. Please don't do that.
[02:42.670 --> 02:47.410]  Does feel kind of like Kickstarter scammy. The idea of like you heat the spoon.
[02:47.970 --> 02:52.370]  Look at this innovation. Look, I want to come over to your house and I want ice cream and I want it
[02:52.370 --> 02:56.450]  to be easily taken out of the ice cream container and I don't want your fingers all over it. So
[02:56.450 --> 03:03.850]  if you can conduct your heat in a more uh sanitary way. What if I shove my hand up a up a plastic bag
[03:03.850 --> 03:08.410]  and then shove my fingers in? That I'm fine with. I don't think that would work well. I think that'd
[03:08.410 --> 03:14.750]  be terrible. Ice cream gloves. You would be fine with that? Yeah yeah sanitary. I want I want ice
[03:14.750 --> 03:20.170]  all right we need to invent ice cream gloves. I want a glove that is made with the same material
[03:20.170 --> 03:26.190]  as those hand warmers. So I'll put my hand in it activates goes really hard and rigid and then
[03:26.190 --> 03:35.010]  do the scooping. Okay what what? You lost me with the rigid part. You want your hand to go rigid?
[03:35.690 --> 03:38.790]  Well I'm just thinking of you know those things that you know those little pouches that you're
[03:38.790 --> 03:44.790]  liquid and you squeeze them and they go hard but hot. What? Have you ever used one they use like
[03:44.790 --> 03:49.510]  there's like a little activated hand warmer. What's yeah the hand warmers we have are always
[03:49.510 --> 03:54.550]  like little packs and you like break them up and it like activates rust and nickel or something or
[03:54.550 --> 03:58.290]  metal and then that's what heats it up. I wouldn't want to put that in ice cream. But that'd be
[03:58.290 --> 04:03.490]  inside the inner walls of the glove. What are what's the outer walls of the glove? Something
[04:03.490 --> 04:09.810]  hygienic. This is not a something hygienic this is not a reusable product. No. Oh these are like
[04:09.810 --> 04:14.510]  condoms this is like a one and done. Oh no no no you like put them in the microwave to reset them.
[04:15.470 --> 04:20.450]  Oh I see I see I see we're talking about two different kinds of hand warmers. Okay I'm
[04:20.450 --> 04:26.310]  yeah when you like get that like uh water below freezing and then suddenly it freezes and you
[04:26.310 --> 04:30.430]  see it like creeping through it's like the opposite of that in a hand warmer. Yeah there's something
[04:30.430 --> 04:35.130]  really funny about imagining you saying who wants some ice cream as you throw your glove into the
[04:35.130 --> 04:41.670]  microwave. Meanwhile other guy with just spoon is doing fine already has two bowls worth like I
[04:41.670 --> 04:46.370]  don't know. Yeah but he bent two spoons in the process and they'll never be straight the right
[04:46.370 --> 04:51.910]  way again. He's using his heat. I take my glove out of the drawer put my hand in hit the button
[04:51.910 --> 04:57.750]  and they go as my hand goes completely solid and hot and then I dunk it in ice cream tubs.
[04:59.090 --> 05:03.410]  Now that's a party trick. It's like a fucking spartan armor lock.
[05:03.690 --> 05:08.210]  Yeah it is yeah and I activate my gel layer stand back ram scoops working.
[05:09.490 --> 05:14.950]  Ice cream flies everywhere. And then he scoops the ice cream he rams his hand in and then scoops
[05:14.950 --> 05:22.230]  out the ice cream. It's so fucking literal. I have a question what are we talking about?
[05:22.350 --> 05:26.350]  We're talking about ice cream scoops. I know what we're talking about. We're talking about products
[05:26.350 --> 05:31.430]  that we will not make. Yeah well I was thinking you want to do the fruit gloves this sounds like
[05:31.430 --> 05:38.450]  maybe an attachment of that and then not future does it do. Well let's put ice cream gloves straight
[05:38.450 --> 05:43.090]  behind fruit gloves as things we'll never make. Which are the fruit gloves are under my desk
[05:43.090 --> 05:47.570]  right now I just have to I'm never gonna make those things. You can test it in the future we
[05:47.570 --> 05:52.290]  have something coming up there's a product that might work. Why do you ask about scooping? Well
[05:52.290 --> 05:57.030]  because ram scoop your name ram scoop. And that that's it? Yeah. How are you feeling by the way
[05:57.030 --> 06:02.430]  this week? A little bit better still still kind of terrible but a little bit better. Get any of
[06:02.430 --> 06:06.330]  those pills or are you still in the Gatorade? There's no point like you have to I guess take
[06:06.330 --> 06:10.910]  the pills within like the first five days for them to work. No point in taking medicine. Well for
[06:10.910 --> 06:16.010]  those specifically hmm do you are you still testing positive? I tested negative for the first time
[06:16.010 --> 06:22.290]  yesterday. Hey congratulations. Nice. A little bit of progress but I'm having a do you guys do you
[06:22.290 --> 06:28.250]  guys listen to things to fall asleep is that a thing that works for you? Yeah. No. That's fair
[06:28.250 --> 06:34.590]  do you have now when you listen to something Gavin does it have to be specific or can it be
[06:34.590 --> 06:40.490]  like anything? How do you make your choice on what you listen to? If it's not designed to make me fall
[06:40.490 --> 06:44.430]  asleep I can listen to it. If it's like one of those sleep things or people talking like they're
[06:44.430 --> 06:48.870]  trying to put you to sleep it just it doesn't work for me. That's fair. I'd rather listen to like a
[06:48.870 --> 06:54.930]  video about a nuclear accident. Really? That specifically? Yeah something that's like mildly
[06:54.930 --> 06:59.810]  interesting I'm like oh yeah I could get into this and then I'm just like so you want something
[06:59.810 --> 07:04.550]  that's like surface level interesting but it's really a trap it's actually boring that's like
[07:05.310 --> 07:11.610]  uh yeah yeah I've got to con myself into falling asleep. I guess maybe I could try that it's got
[07:11.610 --> 07:17.250]  to sneak up on you. I need a narrative typically when I fall asleep so I like I really enjoy rain
[07:17.250 --> 07:22.570]  sounds because I can craft like a thing in my head of like oh it's just raining outside and
[07:22.570 --> 07:26.170]  I'm comfortable and it's raining. Do you pick one of the few things that doesn't have a narrative?
[07:26.510 --> 07:31.230]  Well no for myself for myself I need to establish a narrative in which I'm hearing the sound
[07:31.230 --> 07:36.610]  or else it doesn't it doesn't work for me. Have you considered being awake all day and then doing
[07:36.610 --> 07:41.690]  stuff all day and then at the very end when it's at the end of the day after you've eaten and you've
[07:41.690 --> 07:47.230]  put on your jammies and you brush your teeth and it's like late at night and you're tired just
[07:47.230 --> 07:51.370]  going into a dark room laying into a comfortable bed and then turning closing your eyes and just
[07:51.370 --> 07:56.310]  turning off? I've tried that typically that works. Yeah you've just described everything in the day
[07:56.310 --> 08:00.570]  up to the point where my brain just starts thinking about everything yeah completely
[08:00.570 --> 08:05.150]  apeshit. Gavin's thinking about fucking ice cream gloves and he can't turn it off. It's because
[08:05.150 --> 08:10.690]  you're not using your brain enough in the day. Yeah? It's got too much end of day energy because
[08:10.690 --> 08:15.470]  it's been idle for too long. You gotta you gotta engage with your brain more early on. You need
[08:15.470 --> 08:20.410]  brain reps that's what you need. Yeah hey idiot start start thinking a little bit more fucking
[08:20.410 --> 08:25.290]  dipshit come on I want to try that. Think harder earlier and you'll tire your brain out. That's
[08:26.330 --> 08:32.670]  think harder earlier wake up that's why Geoff is writing down his thoughts wake up think so
[08:32.670 --> 08:36.190]  fucking hard it makes you tired and then just coast through the rest of your day. I'm gonna
[08:36.190 --> 08:39.810]  make it so that when I wake up I bang my head on a sudoku and I just have to get stuck.
[08:41.350 --> 08:48.070]  There's at least one point in almost every day where I go I'm thinking way too hard about this
[08:48.070 --> 08:54.710]  I need a break and it's always face related. That's shocking of all things. That's all I think
[08:54.710 --> 08:59.730]  about dude. Even on a Sunday? Oh no I said almost every day not every day although I don't know
[08:59.730 --> 09:05.430]  about you guys but face is kind of a three six five oh for sure four seven kind of a thing for
[09:05.430 --> 09:10.510]  me. It's just of all the unfortunate all the shows to claim that you think too much too much
[09:10.510 --> 09:15.510]  thinking about. Yeah that's just the only one I care about. The problem for me like so there's
[09:15.510 --> 09:20.790]  some people like train noises my problem is when I hear train noises in my head I'm now in the train
[09:20.790 --> 09:24.850]  and I'm thinking about where am I going and there's nowhere I really want to go
[09:24.850 --> 09:29.950]  in the train and it just becomes uncomfortable and then I can't relax because it's an issue of like
[09:29.950 --> 09:33.670]  I don't want to actually be here like the sounds that's what I meant by narrative I need to craft
[09:33.670 --> 09:40.610]  like where I am why am I hearing this for it to work. Am I on the wrong train? Exactly why am I
[09:40.610 --> 09:44.310]  going here what's the I've never I've never traveled by train why would I choose to choose
[09:44.310 --> 09:50.630]  my train? Is there food on this train? What if that was the sounds of a fictional vehicle? Oh
[09:50.630 --> 09:54.930]  that would be what are we talking like what type of fiction are we thinking are we from like a
[09:54.930 --> 10:00.230]  flying car something underwater? A magic school bus or something. Oh magic you know what I think
[10:00.230 --> 10:04.950]  the magic school bus could work I think I would find that relaxing that might solve my problem I
[10:04.950 --> 10:10.230]  don't know if that exists but I've encountered an issue so with me not being able to breathe one of
[10:10.230 --> 10:16.170]  the only places I've been able to sleep is my bathtub so I've been sleeping in the bath quite a
[10:16.170 --> 10:24.410]  bit and I decided for the first time to mix the rain noises with the bathtub which has been very
[10:24.410 --> 10:31.250]  effective but it is causing me it's causing me several problems I keep waking up in complete
[10:31.250 --> 10:38.730]  terror that I have flooded the bathroom I will wake up to loud water like splashing everywhere
[10:38.730 --> 10:46.150]  and there is a solid 10 seconds of panic that I have completely flooded my living space. You're
[10:46.150 --> 10:53.270]  situation I did yeah I did and it's a real problem so that's why I was asking I was hoping for maybe
[10:53.270 --> 10:59.490]  an alternative find a different sound that would narratively work for me but not make me how about
[10:59.490 --> 11:04.030]  instead of sound have you ever tried to like read in bed that puts me to sleep if I am having trouble
[11:04.030 --> 11:09.630]  but I'm in the tub once again remember Jess right like that's a dangerous game with a book reading
[11:09.630 --> 11:13.970]  in the tub is dangerous to you yeah well because if I'm trying to fall asleep yeah it's not great
[11:15.390 --> 11:16.530]  It's not great for the book.
[11:17.010 --> 11:19.090]  How do you get around the grip problem?
[11:19.670 --> 11:20.490]  What do you mean the grip problem?
[11:20.790 --> 11:23.490]  I feel like when you're sleeping, you're kind of shuffling around to get comfortable.
[11:23.610 --> 11:25.390]  And I feel like all you would hear is like...
[11:25.390 --> 11:27.570]  As your skin is like, hitting the tub.
[11:28.210 --> 11:30.330]  Oh, I get why we talked about this before.
[11:30.410 --> 11:31.990]  I cork in, I cork up.
[11:32.150 --> 11:32.270]  Yeah.
[11:32.590 --> 11:34.170]  Get the water going at a nice temperature.
[11:34.910 --> 11:36.850]  Then, uh, I drift off.
[11:37.370 --> 11:39.290]  He's pretty in there. Like, I think it's pretty solid.
[11:39.410 --> 11:40.230]  Yeah, it's good.
[11:41.390 --> 11:42.190]  There are no concerns.
[11:42.190 --> 11:44.610]  Remember, he's got that weird-shaped bathtub.
[11:44.790 --> 11:45.130]  I do.
[11:45.970 --> 11:46.730]  It's annoying.
[11:46.930 --> 11:48.070]  Yeah, he dams it up.
[11:48.490 --> 11:51.250]  But I've genuinely, like, four or five times in the last few days,
[11:51.330 --> 11:52.750]  I've woken up in complete terror.
[11:53.070 --> 11:54.770]  Thinking that I've flooded everything.
[11:55.370 --> 11:57.390]  Do you have the overflow drain there?
[11:57.850 --> 12:00.170]  Uh, yeah, but the water goes over it.
[12:03.110 --> 12:03.590]  Easily.
[12:04.650 --> 12:05.890]  I did learn...
[12:05.890 --> 12:09.490]  I learned at one point that if you leave it at the highest amount,
[12:09.490 --> 12:13.550]  it drains just fast enough to go over but not above the tub.
[12:13.930 --> 12:17.970]  So you can safely run it at full forever, technically.
[12:18.530 --> 12:19.650]  But you do run out of water.
[12:20.170 --> 12:21.230]  Oh, it's like an infinity pool.
[12:21.510 --> 12:21.830]  It is.
[12:21.890 --> 12:23.310]  Yeah, so what are you scared of?
[12:23.530 --> 12:25.510]  Well, because if you...
[12:25.510 --> 12:27.050]  Oh, my tub is really stupid.
[12:27.170 --> 12:30.430]  If you turn, the full power isn't cranked all the way.
[12:30.770 --> 12:32.810]  All the way is as hot as it can get,
[12:32.910 --> 12:35.990]  but it's not the most volume it can pour.
[12:36.330 --> 12:38.550]  So if you have it in the middle, it's middle temperature
[12:38.550 --> 12:40.010]  and also shooting faster.
[12:40.430 --> 12:42.290]  And if you do it there, it will overflow.
[12:44.410 --> 12:44.810]  Undeniably.
[12:45.510 --> 12:46.250]  That makes sense.
[12:46.350 --> 12:49.670]  So the only way to not overflow is to sear your skin.
[12:50.270 --> 12:50.530]  Yeah.
[12:51.510 --> 12:53.790]  Yeah, I think that's maybe the only way.
[12:53.830 --> 12:56.990]  I did... I almost had an overflow situation where there was like...
[12:56.990 --> 12:59.630]  There was like a piece of plastic or something in the tub.
[12:59.630 --> 13:00.670]  I don't remember what was in the tub.
[13:00.750 --> 13:02.450]  Maybe it was paper that got in the tub
[13:02.450 --> 13:04.890]  and it partially clogged the auto drain.
[13:04.890 --> 13:08.570]  And I realized, I was like, ah, it's making some weird noises.
[13:08.910 --> 13:11.130]  And then I turned the light on, on my phone,
[13:11.210 --> 13:13.010]  and the water was like on the edge.
[13:13.370 --> 13:14.170]  That was terrifying.
[13:14.990 --> 13:16.250]  It was a real mission impossible.
[13:17.190 --> 13:19.030]  So how many hours are you getting at a time?
[13:19.570 --> 13:22.850]  At most like an hour and a half, I'd say.
[13:23.130 --> 13:23.450]  Okay.
[13:24.050 --> 13:26.270]  Since for like over a week now, right?
[13:26.470 --> 13:27.410]  For over a week, yeah.
[13:27.730 --> 13:29.330]  And it's not getting much better?
[13:29.950 --> 13:32.070]  It's improving, but it's not great.
[13:32.070 --> 13:35.430]  And what does the tub give you that the bed doesn't?
[13:35.590 --> 13:39.330]  It locks me up. It quirks me in an upright position.
[13:40.570 --> 13:43.370]  Do you think you could accomplish this with more pillows?
[13:43.710 --> 13:46.310]  Like if you went from 8 to 12 or 16?
[13:46.590 --> 13:50.490]  No, because as Gavin said, there is some shuffling typically to get comfortable.
[13:50.670 --> 13:53.290]  And as I shuffle, the situation adjusts.
[13:53.290 --> 13:54.170]  Oh, you know what you need?
[13:54.330 --> 13:54.770]  What do I need?
[13:54.910 --> 13:55.730]  You need sleep spaghetti.
[13:56.090 --> 13:57.750]  I was thinking about that the other day.
[13:57.830 --> 14:01.310]  You need to burrow into a little nest of sleep spaghetti
[14:01.310 --> 14:04.970]  and it will cradle and comfort you and you won't have to move.
[14:05.290 --> 14:07.730]  I don't think there's any cradling or comfort with sleep spaghetti.
[14:08.090 --> 14:08.670]  Oh, it's amazing.
[14:09.090 --> 14:13.250]  Could we just get a ring of plastic that represents the top of your bathtub
[14:13.250 --> 14:14.610]  and just put that on the bed?
[14:14.870 --> 14:15.990]  Just to like keep you in?
[14:16.190 --> 14:19.050]  I'm imagining like when you cut a cookie.
[14:19.150 --> 14:19.410]  I don't think that would work.
[14:19.490 --> 14:20.910]  You want all of it? No?
[14:21.530 --> 14:22.770]  No, I don't think so.
[14:22.890 --> 14:25.830]  Because that's not the part the bed moves.
[14:26.390 --> 14:27.730]  The bed adjusts.
[14:28.190 --> 14:29.410]  But it would keep you corked.
[14:29.410 --> 14:35.470]  No, it won't because eventually the bed pushes away from the wall.
[14:35.850 --> 14:37.810]  Okay. How about this?
[14:38.170 --> 14:40.030]  How about... that seems like effort too.
[14:40.470 --> 14:43.570]  We have all the tools already in your apartment, I think.
[14:43.750 --> 14:47.530]  What if you just got in the bathtub without putting water in it
[14:47.530 --> 14:48.710]  and threw a blanket over you?
[14:49.250 --> 14:51.490]  I don't... I guess, yeah, that would solve the...
[14:52.050 --> 14:53.990]  I wouldn't be worried about flooding.
[14:54.390 --> 14:55.470]  You wouldn't have to worry about the flooding.
[14:56.070 --> 14:57.490]  You'd be in the sleepable position.
[14:57.490 --> 15:00.550]  And then you just add some... throw a pillow and a blanket in there.
[15:00.790 --> 15:02.390]  I already have a pillow in there.
[15:02.810 --> 15:03.710]  That's already set.
[15:04.650 --> 15:05.770]  There you go. Problem solved.
[15:05.950 --> 15:07.270]  Easy. Okay. I'll try that.
[15:07.650 --> 15:10.130]  I appreciate going through this ridiculous exercise. Thank you.
[15:10.250 --> 15:12.750]  Dude, I want you to sleep more than an hour and a half a night.
[15:12.850 --> 15:14.870]  You do that for too long and you're going to lose your fucking mind.
[15:15.170 --> 15:18.090]  I'm pretty sure if I came over I could get you tucked in in bed
[15:18.090 --> 15:21.010]  in a way that gives you all the benefits of the bath,
[15:21.370 --> 15:22.710]  but you don't absorb water.
[15:23.230 --> 15:25.010]  I think you have no idea what you're talking about.
[15:25.250 --> 15:26.870]  No, I think Gavin's got a point.
[15:26.870 --> 15:28.950]  Sometimes getting tucked in is awesome.
[15:29.390 --> 15:29.770]  I agree.
[15:29.970 --> 15:33.610]  There needs to be a service for people that want to be tucked in.
[15:34.110 --> 15:35.090]  Professionally tucked in.
[15:35.410 --> 15:36.550]  I could tuck you in.
[15:37.010 --> 15:37.350]  Yeah.
[15:37.670 --> 15:40.390]  Yeah. I don't disagree with the tucking part.
[15:40.550 --> 15:42.890]  I get anxious about the tuck.
[15:43.370 --> 15:46.530]  Because once I've been tucked, I would feel bad if I untucked.
[15:46.690 --> 15:48.190]  Yeah, but you're a guy who likes to be corked.
[15:48.270 --> 15:49.210]  You would love to be tucked.
[15:49.430 --> 15:51.190]  And if I'm there to re-tuck you...
[15:51.190 --> 15:53.510]  That's what I was going... I was going to say,
[15:53.510 --> 15:57.050]  this is a situation where if it was just a person, very uncomfortable.
[15:57.350 --> 16:01.110]  But if Gavin comes over, tucks Andrew in,
[16:01.270 --> 16:04.910]  and then stays with him all night in case he gets untucked,
[16:04.910 --> 16:07.830]  and then re-tucks him, I think that that's a great idea.
[16:07.830 --> 16:09.370]  Now are you enforcing the tuck?
[16:09.930 --> 16:11.510]  Do I have to remain tucked?
[16:12.050 --> 16:14.150]  Or do I have free will here? Can I get up?
[16:14.170 --> 16:15.390]  You want to remain tucked.
[16:15.550 --> 16:20.230]  No, but my brain gets chaotic and would want for the worst.
[16:20.650 --> 16:22.830]  But you're tucked in the bathtub. What are you talking about?
[16:22.830 --> 16:24.110]  You just like to be corked.
[16:24.370 --> 16:28.150]  No, I understand, but I'm saying that in a scenario in which there's somebody there to tuck me,
[16:28.510 --> 16:30.150]  my brain is immediately going to go,
[16:30.230 --> 16:33.430]  well, I'm just not going to be tucked. I'm going to fight this tucking as much as possible.
[16:34.290 --> 16:36.110]  I'm just going to be as difficult as I can be.
[16:36.110 --> 16:39.250]  You gotta... you gotta fuck... you gotta deal with you then.
[16:39.510 --> 16:40.510]  Oh, that's... yeah, absolutely.
[16:40.550 --> 16:42.130]  Sounds like you're inviting me over to wrestle.
[16:42.310 --> 16:45.470]  No, I don't... I'm not going to wrestle. I'm just going to sneak out of that tuck a little bit.
[16:45.530 --> 16:48.890]  It's like... it's... there's a difference between, like, wanting help sleeping,
[16:49.010 --> 16:51.490]  and then being combative about getting help sleeping.
[16:51.490 --> 16:53.610]  You're the most defiant sleeper.
[16:53.890 --> 16:56.810]  I... yeah, well, it's not sleeping necessarily, it's just like,
[16:56.850 --> 17:00.730]  oh, oh, you're going to make me tucked? I gotta be tucked? Okay, we'll see about that.
[17:01.010 --> 17:02.110]  We'll see how tucked I am.
[17:02.350 --> 17:04.990]  That's like if I brought you lunch, and you're like, oh, you want me to eat?
[17:05.030 --> 17:06.090]  And you just kick it out the window.
[17:06.410 --> 17:08.510]  I'll show you how fucking hungry I am.
[17:10.070 --> 17:14.170]  If we were in our paranoid era of this show, that is how I would have reacted, for sure.
[17:14.390 --> 17:15.250]  I wouldn't trust lunch for me.
[17:15.350 --> 17:19.130]  So you wouldn't be able to, just for one night, relax, let me tuck you in,
[17:19.130 --> 17:24.210]  let me make you try and feel corked in a bed, and then maybe just keep an eye on it all night?
[17:24.690 --> 17:27.690]  I think it would be the worst night of sleep of my life. Easily.
[17:28.530 --> 17:32.070]  I think I would be so uncomfortable, and then I wouldn't want to move.
[17:32.330 --> 17:35.770]  Realistically, I wouldn't move, and I'd just be miserable the entire night.
[17:35.830 --> 17:38.930]  Well, I would be, as I'm tucking you in, I'd be wanting feedback.
[17:39.070 --> 17:41.630]  I'd be like, how's that feel? How's it feel on the legs? Is your back supported?
[17:42.070 --> 17:47.850]  But how you feel in one moment is not how you're going to feel several moments down the road, potentially.
[17:47.850 --> 17:49.570]  Well, that's what I'm there for. I'm there all night.
[17:49.850 --> 17:53.410]  But you don't have that option when you're corked in the tub.
[17:53.590 --> 17:56.890]  Like, once you're set, you're set. So I don't know why it has to be different in the bed.
[17:56.910 --> 17:58.170]  Just because Gavin did it?
[17:58.810 --> 18:01.950]  I, yeah, I guess, I don't know, I'd feel like there'd be a weird social pressure,
[18:02.410 --> 18:03.970]  wanting Gavin to feel like he did a good job.
[18:04.190 --> 18:07.330]  I feel like this isn't a sleep issue, it's a you and me issue now.
[18:07.410 --> 18:10.210]  It could, yeah, I think it would be a person issue at that point.
[18:10.490 --> 18:12.530]  Huh. I guess I'm disqualified.
[18:12.970 --> 18:15.770]  How about your mom? Do you trust your mom to tuck you in?
[18:15.770 --> 18:18.270]  No, I don't think there's anyone. I don't think there's any person.
[18:18.930 --> 18:22.150]  Dude, I would let my mom tuck me in. My mom was good at tucking me in.
[18:22.250 --> 18:24.550]  Dude, that's the best person that could tuck you in. The best.
[18:25.270 --> 18:28.730]  But what type of, are we talking like a standard? I'm very specific as well.
[18:28.730 --> 18:32.410]  I don't like the sheets under the bed. I need the sheets loose.
[18:32.650 --> 18:34.590]  You don't like sheets? Oh, yeah, yeah.
[18:34.650 --> 18:36.130]  Yeah, they need to be, you gotta have those feet free.
[18:36.130 --> 18:37.870]  You don't like an under mattress tuck?
[18:37.990 --> 18:42.590]  No. And I feel like that's part of the standard tuck experience. The default.
[18:42.590 --> 18:46.610]  I could customize the tuck experience to whatever you want. That's the point.
[18:46.850 --> 18:49.090]  No, I understand. Yeah, I just, I don't think it would work.
[18:49.670 --> 18:53.630]  Okay. Yeah, I just don't know why you have to shit on his idea before we even try it.
[18:53.710 --> 18:57.110]  He's giving you the option of ultimate tuck flexibility here.
[18:57.630 --> 19:01.730]  I don't, I don't, respectfully as well, you get, because it's a very kind offer.
[19:01.990 --> 19:05.450]  I don't think you know how to tuck very well. I don't trust your tucking ability.
[19:05.910 --> 19:08.450]  Oh, you're full of shit. Well, now you're attacking Gavin.
[19:08.450 --> 19:11.070]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna watch you. I'm gonna say, get in the bath.
[19:11.490 --> 19:13.830]  Fall asleep in the bath. I'm going to watch everything you do in the bath.
[19:13.930 --> 19:17.590]  I'm going to watch what happens. I'm going to replicate. I'm going to order supplies.
[19:17.730 --> 19:20.650]  I'm going to replicate that the next night in the bed. And you're going to be,
[19:20.830 --> 19:23.530]  you're going to feel like you're in the bath, but you'll be able to go all night.
[19:23.770 --> 19:27.890]  I think, I think you're going to look at me in the bed and immediately go, I'm not qualified for this.
[19:28.310 --> 19:31.690]  I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing here. This is more complex than I realized.
[19:31.890 --> 19:36.610]  I just don't know. Look, clearly I'm not using my brain enough in the day, right?
[19:36.610 --> 19:43.270]  I'm too awake at night. If I put, if I put all of my effort into getting you tucked, I think I'd sleep soundly.
[19:44.510 --> 19:48.270]  That, that, yes. Yes, you would. I bet you would sleep better than I would.
[19:48.730 --> 19:51.270]  This is actually a solution if you have sleep issues.
[19:51.770 --> 19:55.070]  Maybe this is the only way to get both of you a good night's sleep.
[19:58.550 --> 20:02.670]  The thing is, the immediate issue I have with all this is that if I'm going to get any sleep,
[20:02.670 --> 20:09.310]  I'm going to have to sleep on his floor, which I assume is completely filthy, disgusting, crumbs, hair.
[20:09.970 --> 20:12.850]  No, we determined that Andrew's was quite clean.
[20:13.970 --> 20:14.650]  Wait, what?
[20:15.070 --> 20:18.750]  When we saw, we saw pictures of his apartment and we were like, oh, it's so much cleaner than we thought.
[20:18.750 --> 20:20.070]  It was really clean. Yeah. Yeah.
[20:20.270 --> 20:26.050]  There are times, listen, I will knock over a thing and I'll trip over a sushi container, but it's not going to live there.
[20:27.090 --> 20:31.350]  Did you see the AI pictures somebody did of Jesus throughout the eras?
[20:31.770 --> 20:33.170]  And they had Jesus slipping. No.
[20:33.330 --> 20:39.090]  It was on the F***face subreddit. They had Jesus slipping on Andrew's sushi container.
[20:39.730 --> 20:40.530]  No, I'd love to see it.
[20:40.590 --> 20:41.730]  Eric, can you find that and throw it in the chat?
[20:42.190 --> 20:43.050]  Yeah, I'll see if I can find it.
[20:43.150 --> 20:44.290]  Thanks. That's great.
[20:44.870 --> 20:50.070]  It's in the, it's not, there's a, there's a thread that has like 10 photos in it and like you can scroll through.
[20:50.150 --> 20:54.090]  And then in the comments is that one, that specific one, because they forgot to include it.
[20:54.090 --> 21:04.130]  I just, before I'm finding these, I'm looking right now, but I just want to point out, I said it in the chat, that this is the episode where the most could probably be taken out of context and just put into like drops.
[21:04.130 --> 21:05.270]  Anything sticking out for you?
[21:05.790 --> 21:07.530]  Yeah, just, I mean, when you're talking...
[21:07.530 --> 21:08.610]  You didn't go all night. You said that.
[21:08.610 --> 21:08.790]  Yeah.
[21:09.150 --> 21:10.930]  That flagged in my head.
[21:11.370 --> 21:17.810]  I'll get you in the bed and then, and then you won't know what to do with me in the bath.
[21:18.270 --> 21:20.930]  I'm going to study what you do in the bathtub.
[21:21.570 --> 21:21.710]  Yeah.
[21:21.710 --> 21:24.510]  Should we make that the preview for next week?
[21:24.870 --> 21:25.410]  Yeah, really.
[21:25.430 --> 21:26.410]  Out of context.
[21:28.170 --> 21:35.010]  I just want to point out, somebody removed the topic from the subreddit. It was deemed too far off topic.
[21:35.470 --> 21:36.210]  Oh, that's...
[21:36.210 --> 21:36.930]  I'm just letting you know.
[21:37.270 --> 21:37.750]  That's so sad.
[21:37.750 --> 21:39.750]  That moderator is out of control.
[21:40.050 --> 21:40.610]  Just saying.
[21:40.830 --> 21:45.070]  Well, anyway, there's a picture out there somewhere of Jesus slipping on Andrew's sushi container and it looks...
[21:45.070 --> 21:51.910]  You'll probably be able to see it in the comments for this one, because I'm sure they're going to be eager to put it back in and be like, I told you so.
[21:52.130 --> 21:58.410]  How is Jesus slipping on sushi too far away from this? Where else would that be used?
[21:58.990 --> 22:00.030]  Probably in the Bible.
[22:00.890 --> 22:04.190]  Yeah, I would think it's either here or the Bible.
[22:04.370 --> 22:06.430]  Like the Bible, like 2023 edition.
[22:07.850 --> 22:10.830]  You're not a big Jesus Falls subreddit user.
[22:11.170 --> 22:12.730]  It's not one of your go-to places.
[22:14.810 --> 22:25.130]  I realized earlier that I sent some totally non-ironic pictures as a part of a work conversation yesterday, and I looked at it again.
[22:25.210 --> 22:26.510]  I was like, how is this work?
[22:27.170 --> 22:27.570]  What do you mean?
[22:31.750 --> 22:38.270]  For the audience, it's pictures of the Thrice to Meet You prototype and the smashed remote control from Gavin's bedroom.
[22:38.930 --> 22:41.030]  Because they wanted to know how big they were.
[22:41.030 --> 22:42.850]  For the F*** Face Museum.
[22:43.710 --> 22:52.670]  A part of me, I went all out because a part of me was like, one is the length of an Apple TV remote and the other is the length of two gloves.
[22:52.970 --> 22:55.530]  But then I thought, I'll go all out and I'll do it properly.
[22:56.190 --> 22:56.930]  Oh, that's great.
[22:57.750 --> 23:05.890]  It did make me really happy to read that email because they asked for measurements on things like the rock that you guys dug up for the bean hole video.
[23:06.230 --> 23:08.730]  The idea that the rock needs to be measured is so funny.
[23:08.730 --> 23:12.390]  I know. And I gotta f***ing go out and take pictures of it too.
[23:12.530 --> 23:13.810]  Just send them the video.
[23:14.070 --> 23:17.990]  I was so busy. Here's a 30 minute video. Figure it out.
[23:18.390 --> 23:22.690]  I was so busy today taking photos of other s*** that I'm pushing that off until next week.
[23:22.950 --> 23:25.750]  So you've been working hard on recipe book photography?
[23:26.230 --> 23:31.990]  Yeah, we missed you. We thought you were going to show up because you expressed interest at Lasertag, but you did not show up. But it's fine.
[23:32.450 --> 23:36.370]  It would have been talent heavy at that point.
[23:36.610 --> 23:37.470]  At Lasertag?
[23:37.470 --> 23:39.430]  Oh yeah, we would tell Lasertag for Gavin's birthday.
[23:39.750 --> 23:41.370]  Oh, s***. That's amazing.
[23:41.670 --> 23:45.410]  I didn't invite you, Andrew, because, you know, you weren't set foot in this country.
[23:45.970 --> 23:47.350]  I would have loved to have had you there.
[23:47.730 --> 23:52.730]  That's not true, second of all. I initially felt bad that I missed your birthday and that's gone.
[23:53.010 --> 23:56.290]  That flew away. I got blasted on the field first.
[23:57.270 --> 23:58.170]  When was your birthday?
[23:59.010 --> 24:00.130]  Same day as it is every year.
[24:04.330 --> 24:05.050]  That's rough.
[24:05.050 --> 24:08.390]  I wrote my last episode because I like the way it looks written down.
[24:08.430 --> 24:15.190]  You did? That's not fair in defense to me. I was deep in COVID at that point.
[24:15.330 --> 24:15.830]  23rd of May.
[24:15.950 --> 24:17.190]  It's May 23rd.
[24:17.330 --> 24:18.490]  I'm a Gemini edger.
[24:20.590 --> 24:21.110]  Yeah.
[24:21.750 --> 24:26.410]  Out of context says a lot. You did a lot of the work with this episode.
[24:28.590 --> 24:29.830]  That's really f***ing funny.
[24:30.390 --> 24:38.690]  Today we did the product photography for Andrew's coffee for the regulation pizza, which I'm really excited about the way we did that.
[24:39.290 --> 24:41.770]  Gavin's cold cheese sandwich we shot.
[24:41.850 --> 24:44.170]  We shot Andrew's desk grilled cheese.
[24:44.390 --> 24:46.250]  We shot the regulation bagel.
[24:46.610 --> 24:49.970]  We shot Andrew's hash brown mash, which is one of the grossest things I've ever made.
[24:50.490 --> 24:51.010]  And boiled peanuts.
[24:51.390 --> 24:54.550]  We just have the condiments and the purple nightmare left to film.
[24:54.650 --> 24:55.930]  We just didn't get to it today. It was a lot.
[24:56.010 --> 24:57.430]  So you had to make all these?
[24:57.770 --> 24:57.990]  Yeah.
[24:57.990 --> 24:58.650]  Yeah.
[24:59.150 --> 24:59.310]  Wow.
[24:59.450 --> 25:01.890]  Well, I had to make them look made, right?
[25:02.150 --> 25:06.430]  So the peanuts didn't have to be boiled for seven hours.
[25:06.570 --> 25:07.670]  They got boiled for like three.
[25:08.130 --> 25:12.050]  And did you follow the instructions to my cheese sandwich as I wrote them?
[25:12.130 --> 25:12.790]  Or did you just...
[25:12.790 --> 25:15.070]  You can ask Eric to annoying detail.
[25:15.330 --> 25:19.730]  I have the cookbook up on my laptop and I mentioned to him many times.
[25:19.970 --> 25:23.650]  Boy, it's really convenient to have all these recipes right here in a cookbook when I'm trying to make them.
[25:25.310 --> 25:32.710]  He did. It was so thorough that as he was reading it out loud, Millie kept looking at me and like rolling her eyes.
[25:34.350 --> 25:40.750]  It was just the excruciating detail of making a cold sandwich that was just cheese and Branson pickle.
[25:40.930 --> 25:41.610]  It was great.
[25:41.810 --> 25:43.030]  It was really something.
[25:44.410 --> 25:45.910]  I'm so excited to see it.
[25:46.410 --> 25:46.590]  Yeah.
[25:46.690 --> 25:47.750]  Oh, they look great.
[25:48.010 --> 25:49.350]  Like the photos are incredible.
[25:49.610 --> 25:50.150]  They're awesome.
[25:51.350 --> 25:55.650]  I've realized that my life just doesn't function now unless there's a calendar invite for it.
[25:55.810 --> 25:59.130]  I just had no idea that was happening today, even though you told me about it.
[26:00.670 --> 26:01.470]  Well, I don't know.
[26:01.490 --> 26:02.770]  Sorry about that, man.
[26:02.970 --> 26:03.810]  I apologize.
[26:04.270 --> 26:06.190]  No, this is me. I'm sorry.
[26:07.350 --> 26:08.230]  I'm worthless.
[26:09.010 --> 26:12.090]  I'll make sure that we have invites going forward.
[26:12.330 --> 26:18.230]  I will say there was an invite on the calendar for me and Geoff, so I can't knock you for that.
[26:18.750 --> 26:20.330]  I'll just make sure you're on it next time.
[26:20.510 --> 26:22.350]  Here's a little preview of...
[26:22.350 --> 26:23.030]  Oh, no.
[26:23.390 --> 26:24.030]  Oh, wow.
[26:24.210 --> 26:25.110]  What is that?
[26:25.250 --> 26:28.710]  It's red sauce with a pepperoni slice in it.
[26:28.730 --> 26:29.590]  It looks like a cocktail.
[26:30.170 --> 26:31.750]  It does look a little bit like a cocktail.
[26:32.290 --> 26:35.170]  We got creative with how we presented a lot of the ingredients.
[26:35.690 --> 26:41.850]  We decided instead of showing you what a boring old regulation pizza looks like, we'll show you the before photo.
[26:44.070 --> 26:47.830]  And then you can take your own after photo and put it in there.
[26:47.830 --> 26:51.530]  We're going to make a box, like an open box on the page.
[26:51.650 --> 26:53.430]  It's like, insert your own after photo here.
[26:55.190 --> 27:03.110]  I would be so mad if I bought a cookbook and every photo was just the ingredients and not actually what it looks like.
[27:03.250 --> 27:07.430]  Which is a fucking joke we came up with at the grocery store when we were walking around, I think.
[27:08.030 --> 27:10.590]  I was like, I don't want to cook a fucking full pizza today.
[27:11.130 --> 27:16.470]  I feel like we've been on fire with the suddenness of coming up with ideas recently.
[27:16.470 --> 27:17.590]  It's been really good.
[27:17.710 --> 27:25.490]  Yeah, Eric and I have a really good idea for a piece of supplemental content we want to do with you guys that we came up with yesterday while we were doing the Break Show.
[27:25.910 --> 27:27.990]  Did you go shopping together today? You were in a supermarket?
[27:28.530 --> 27:28.650]  Yeah.
[27:28.690 --> 27:29.090]  Oh, man.
[27:29.490 --> 27:33.370]  He came by at 11. We went to HEB and then we bought all the ingredients.
[27:33.550 --> 27:36.530]  I'd printed out, I'd made a list of everything I thought we needed and then we came home.
[27:36.830 --> 27:39.150]  Earlier, I got up about 7am to start all this.
[27:39.270 --> 27:43.470]  I had to go to the storage facility to get the lighting kits and everything and get it all set up.
[27:43.530 --> 27:45.570]  I had to borrow Millie's camera. It wasn't charged.
[27:45.570 --> 27:49.670]  I had to charge it. It didn't have a card in it, so I had to go buy an SD card.
[27:50.310 --> 27:54.590]  I'm devastated because this would have been a great day for Stuart to show up after a long day.
[27:54.610 --> 27:57.310]  Yeah, Stuart would have had a ball. He would have had a fucking ball.
[27:57.690 --> 28:02.490]  Eric and I, first off, we're great. We're hardworking dudes.
[28:02.830 --> 28:04.750]  We are not great at shopping at a grocery store.
[28:04.970 --> 28:10.310]  I was telling him, I wish I could see a heat map of us going back and forth to the grocery store trying to find stuff.
[28:10.690 --> 28:12.950]  We went to both sides three times.
[28:12.950 --> 28:17.670]  It was bad. And the whole time we're going, I hate grocery shopping.
[28:18.090 --> 28:21.590]  H-E-B has an app. It tells you exactly where everything is.
[28:22.090 --> 28:24.090]  Oh, I didn't know H-E-B had an app that tells you that.
[28:24.090 --> 28:24.970]  I wasn't aware of that either.
[28:25.350 --> 28:26.050]  I had no idea.
[28:26.370 --> 28:28.970]  Where the fuck were you at 11.30 when we needed the app?
[28:29.690 --> 28:33.090]  Well, you guys clearly didn't want Stuart around, so you didn't put a calendar invite in.
[28:34.690 --> 28:42.350]  Dude, the other day I was walking, I must have heat mapped like the same place six times looking for some Old Bay spice or something.
[28:42.410 --> 28:44.290]  And then I looked in the app and it told me exactly where it was.
[28:44.410 --> 28:46.430]  That's exactly where it was. It's incredible.
[28:46.850 --> 28:49.950]  The hardest thing for us to find today, I think, was cranberry sauce.
[28:50.310 --> 28:51.190]  Yep. Really?
[28:51.450 --> 28:52.350]  So do you have more to do?
[28:52.750 --> 28:55.890]  Yeah, I'm going to cook everybody's, I'm going to make everybody's condiments.
[28:56.050 --> 29:00.150]  There are five because Eric didn't make one during the contest, but he made one later.
[29:00.590 --> 29:01.930]  So I'm going to make all the condiments.
[29:01.930 --> 29:03.630]  I'm going to make the purple nightmare.
[29:04.110 --> 29:06.330]  And then I have Gavin's holiday stuffing and that's it.
[29:06.490 --> 29:07.970]  Everything else, like I said, is made.
[29:08.630 --> 29:13.930]  Or we're going to use stock photography or art.
[29:14.930 --> 29:17.370]  You know, like have Tobin or Michelle or somebody draw something.
[29:17.630 --> 29:18.390]  So when are you doing the rest?
[29:19.190 --> 29:20.330]  I'll probably do it Monday or something.
[29:21.610 --> 29:22.190]  Need a hand?
[29:23.470 --> 29:24.530]  Yeah, I would love a hand.
[29:25.550 --> 29:28.070]  I would love for you to see what I'm going to do with your condiment.
[29:28.310 --> 29:28.970]  Yeah, that'd be great.
[29:28.970 --> 29:32.010]  Are you going to take a picture on the bottom of your foot?
[29:33.790 --> 29:35.470]  We'll see. I got some ideas.
[29:35.970 --> 29:39.170]  That whole sequence out of context is incredible.
[29:39.630 --> 29:41.370]  There's just so much you could do with all that.
[29:41.730 --> 29:43.250]  This is a great out of context episode.
[29:49.310 --> 29:51.610]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[29:52.050 --> 29:55.610]  It's so important to find time for yourself in a week.
[29:55.770 --> 29:59.450]  Like I know for me personally, it's something I'm not always the best at,
[29:59.450 --> 30:04.590]  but I have learned through a lot of experience that it is so easy to burn yourself out.
[30:04.730 --> 30:09.330]  And I'm somebody that I really struggle when people around me are maybe struggling themselves.
[30:09.930 --> 30:12.130]  And I feel an obligation to be there for them.
[30:12.550 --> 30:19.690]  But if you're not taking care of yourself, you're not putting yourself in a position to give them the best support and care that they need, which they deserve.
[30:19.970 --> 30:24.870]  It's so easy to get caught up in what everyone else needs from you and never take a moment to think about what you need from yourself.
[30:24.870 --> 30:27.950]  It's just such a difficult process to sort through.
[30:28.430 --> 30:31.010]  And it's so important to be mindful of those situations.
[30:31.310 --> 30:35.830]  When we spend all of our time giving, it can leave us feeling stretched thin and burned out.
[30:36.330 --> 30:41.470]  Therapy can give you the tools to find more balance in your life so you can keep supporting others without leaving yourself behind.
[30:42.210 --> 30:45.090]  Therapy is such an important process to go through.
[30:45.310 --> 30:48.170]  I have found it to be extremely helpful in my life.
[30:48.170 --> 30:57.490]  I had all sorts of issues I had to work through and just progress on and create systems for, whether it be anxiety or just other things I faced growing up.
[30:57.950 --> 31:05.370]  I think it's such an important process to go through and I would highly recommend that anyone go through it or at least give it a try.
[31:05.730 --> 31:07.510]  I think it's a wonderful thing to do.
[31:07.870 --> 31:10.970]  So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.

[31:32.350 --> 31:38.970]  Hey everyone, we wanted to take a moment to remind you that RTX 2023 is happening this July 7th through July 9th.
[31:39.350 --> 31:43.150]  Join us this summer for a memorable weekend at our Camp for Indoor Kids.

[31:58.470 --> 32:00.870]  RTX 2023 is an event you won't want to miss.
[32:01.230 --> 32:04.590]  Badges for this three-day funfest are available for as low as $55.
[32:05.350 --> 32:08.090]  Thanks for listening to us get very excited about RTX.
[32:08.090 --> 32:10.290]  We're looking forward to meeting all of you there.
[32:10.570 --> 32:17.090]  So head on over to www.rtxaustin.com to get more information about the event and buy your badge.
[32:19.590 --> 32:24.330]  Can I tell you guys two really quick stupid, stupid stories?
[32:24.970 --> 32:25.590]  Yeah, of course.
[32:25.870 --> 32:26.630]  Of dumb things I did.
[32:26.890 --> 32:34.450]  I think even though I haven't had COVID for a bit now, and I didn't have it for very long, and I never really got that sick, I think I still have COVID fog on my brain.
[32:34.450 --> 32:39.150]  Because last night, Emily and I went to bed, and we were going to watch a succession.
[32:39.790 --> 32:45.890]  And I realized, it's the first time I've tried to use the HBO Max, since the fucking flip-over thing.
[32:46.310 --> 32:52.670]  And so I click on the app, and it takes me to the store, like the Apple Store, to download the new version of the app.
[32:53.310 --> 32:56.890]  And it asks me to put in my username and my password, my HBO username and password.
[32:57.090 --> 32:57.750]  And so I do.
[32:58.410 --> 33:00.430]  And it's one of those auto-generated ones.
[33:00.430 --> 33:06.950]  And for some reason, there's a problem with my iPhone where it won't connect to CarPlay, and it won't connect to TVs anymore.
[33:07.690 --> 33:09.650]  So I can't ever do it on my phone.
[33:10.190 --> 33:15.830]  And so I'm painstakingly typing this password, and it's like 30 characters, and I just can't get it.
[33:16.170 --> 33:23.030]  And so eventually, I switch it all over and have Emily download it all, and then try to do it on her phone, and copy and paste the password.
[33:23.130 --> 33:24.170]  And it's not working, it's not working.
[33:24.450 --> 33:26.270]  So then I go, and I reset the password.
[33:26.430 --> 33:28.370]  And I'm able to log in on my phone just fine.
[33:28.370 --> 33:30.630]  It's just the fucking TV app won't work.
[33:30.730 --> 33:32.870]  I can log into the app on my phone just fine.
[33:33.090 --> 33:35.490]  So I'm like, fuck it, maybe I'll just change my password and we'll start all over again.
[33:35.510 --> 33:39.050]  So I change my password on the phone and get it all to work.
[33:39.110 --> 33:40.130]  It logs in, it works.
[33:40.590 --> 33:42.290]  Go to it, Emily tries again.
[33:43.030 --> 33:47.050]  We're working on two fucking phones here at this point, and this app.
[33:47.490 --> 33:51.010]  And I'm literally like 25 minutes.
[33:51.190 --> 33:54.650]  At some point, I'm like, can we just cast it from the phone to the TV?
[33:54.890 --> 33:55.790]  I'm prepared to do that.
[33:55.830 --> 33:56.810]  And then I'm like, no, that's quitting.
[33:56.810 --> 33:58.130]  That's quitter behavior.
[33:58.250 --> 33:59.070]  I'm going to figure this out.
[33:59.370 --> 34:06.690]  And then like literally like 25 minutes into just me bitching nonstop to Emily about how this is so fucking stupid and it doesn't work.
[34:07.150 --> 34:09.310]  Emily looks at it and she goes, what password are you typing in?
[34:09.330 --> 34:10.910]  And I go, my fucking HBO password.
[34:11.050 --> 34:14.510]  And she goes, it says it wants your Apple ID password.
[34:14.770 --> 34:19.370]  I think it's asking for permission to install the app, not log into the app, you idiot.
[34:19.830 --> 34:25.670]  And then I spent the next 15 minutes trying to figure out what my stupid Apple ID password was.
[34:25.670 --> 34:26.770]  And then I did.
[34:27.130 --> 34:27.930]  And then it fucking worked.
[34:28.610 --> 34:33.030]  I spent over 30 minutes trying to watch Succession last night because I'm stupid.
[34:34.950 --> 34:36.710]  I'm a hundred percent dumb.
[34:37.050 --> 34:41.490]  And then today I plug in this fucking SD card into Millie's camera.
[34:41.890 --> 34:45.110]  I had to borrow her camera and it won't format the card.
[34:45.190 --> 34:47.930]  And it keeps telling me that it can't capture to the card needs to be formatted.
[34:48.030 --> 34:49.890]  And I keep going to format it and it won't format.
[34:49.930 --> 34:50.590]  I won't format it.
[34:50.770 --> 34:52.250]  And I'm getting mad and I'm yelling at it.
[34:52.270 --> 34:53.750]  And I'm like, Millie, your fucking camera doesn't work.
[34:53.750 --> 34:55.150]  And Millie's looking at it and she goes, hold on.
[34:55.490 --> 34:57.990]  And then she's like, we reseat the card and we go through a bunch of times.
[34:58.090 --> 35:00.190]  And then she takes it out and she goes, there's no card in here.
[35:00.570 --> 35:03.730]  This is just like the sleeve. You're supposed to put the micro SD card in the...
[35:03.730 --> 35:07.250]  And I realized that I just didn't take that out of the wrapper.
[35:07.370 --> 35:10.610]  I just took the fucking, like the thing out and just stuck that in.
[35:10.670 --> 35:12.350]  And there was no goddamn card in the whole time.
[35:12.530 --> 35:13.910]  You plugged in an adapter.
[35:14.310 --> 35:15.290]  I plugged in an adapter.
[35:15.670 --> 35:19.270]  And then I just shoved the fucking actual card like in a drawer somewhere.
[35:19.450 --> 35:20.470]  And I had to go find it.
[35:20.470 --> 35:30.450]  It's like plugging in a light to an extension cord and not plugging in the extension cord into the wall and going, what the fuck is wrong with this thing?
[35:30.730 --> 35:35.930]  It was so long and Geoff was so mad.
[35:36.270 --> 35:37.270]  So mad.
[35:38.070 --> 35:41.170]  I get mad so fast when stuff doesn't work now.
[35:41.230 --> 35:42.410]  And it's always me.
[35:42.990 --> 35:43.930]  It's never stuff.
[35:44.070 --> 35:45.290]  It's never stuff's fault.
[35:45.570 --> 35:49.470]  I want someone from HBO to come by and clean up their shit.
[35:49.470 --> 35:50.630]  That's two apps now.
[35:50.790 --> 35:52.590]  That's HBO now and HBO.
[35:52.910 --> 35:53.270]  That's three.
[35:53.370 --> 35:54.270]  HBO Go.
[35:54.530 --> 35:55.190]  HBO Max.
[35:55.310 --> 35:56.330]  It's just dregs.
[35:56.430 --> 35:57.670]  It's all gone though now, right?
[35:58.290 --> 35:59.230]  Yeah, it's just Max.
[35:59.230 --> 36:00.850]  Oh, you just want somebody to come and delete it all for you?
[36:00.990 --> 36:03.330]  Yeah, stop leaving empty apps, you idiots.
[36:04.990 --> 36:06.390]  Wait, you're mad?
[36:06.570 --> 36:08.390]  You're mad that you still haven't downloaded?
[36:08.750 --> 36:10.030]  That's what this outrage is about?
[36:10.050 --> 36:12.130]  No, it's just leaving a bunch of mess.
[36:12.270 --> 36:14.410]  It's like kicking a bunch of trash through my front door.
[36:14.510 --> 36:15.670]  Just delete it.
[36:15.730 --> 36:16.650]  What are you talking about?
[36:16.670 --> 36:17.010]  I don't know.
[36:17.310 --> 36:19.110]  I'm not with you on that one.
[36:21.330 --> 36:22.610]  Gavin, I'm with you.
[36:22.730 --> 36:27.470]  It's like having a party and somebody brings a bunch of stuff and then leaves a bunch of garbage at your house.
[36:27.830 --> 36:30.410]  You already made me switch to the new app like a year ago.
[36:30.510 --> 36:31.450]  What's wrong with this one?
[36:31.890 --> 36:39.570]  I will say I'm in no position to criticize apps for at least the next three weeks based on the stupidity of last night.
[36:39.750 --> 36:43.350]  I kind of wish you never would have figured it out and you were still mad at HBO.
[36:43.410 --> 36:44.830]  Dude, I was so angry.
[36:44.950 --> 36:47.290]  And I'm like, why does it work on my phone?
[36:47.290 --> 36:50.990]  Why can I log in on my phone with the same password?
[36:51.350 --> 36:51.950]  That's amazing.
[36:52.670 --> 36:54.690]  Do you want to see an amazing coincidence?
[36:55.110 --> 36:55.970]  I would love to see.
[36:56.250 --> 37:02.830]  After the last episode, because we were talking about how Geoff and I stayed in that really romantic room in San Antonio.
[37:03.830 --> 37:07.650]  My phone must have heard me because in my memories this popped up.
[37:07.850 --> 37:08.890]  Oh my god.
[37:09.670 --> 37:10.070]  2013.
[37:12.490 --> 37:16.130]  Yeah, I'm not sure if that was the time because I think I've been there a couple of times.
[37:16.130 --> 37:17.330]  I'm not sure if that was the exact time.
[37:17.330 --> 37:18.090]  Yeah, we've been there a few times.
[37:18.390 --> 37:20.330]  Yeah, but I just love that that popped up.
[37:20.510 --> 37:21.050]  That's perfect.
[37:21.150 --> 37:22.690]  Almost exactly 10 years ago.
[37:23.010 --> 37:27.370]  I mean, if we were there June 13th, 2013, that would have been for an NBA Finals game.
[37:27.470 --> 37:29.410]  That would have been the Spurs versus the Heat.
[37:29.570 --> 37:35.930]  That was probably the night that you dumped your drink down that lady's shirt from behind.
[37:36.050 --> 37:41.770]  And then we saw her texting about some idiot Heat fans that just dumped their drink on her.
[37:41.870 --> 37:45.350]  And she was about ready to turn around and slap the shit out of us for being annoying.
[37:45.350 --> 37:46.030]  Yeah.
[37:46.350 --> 37:46.730]  Yeah.
[37:47.850 --> 37:48.290]  Yeah.
[37:50.610 --> 37:51.050]  Yeah.
[37:51.130 --> 37:54.350]  My first couple of years in this country were just madness.
[37:56.210 --> 37:56.650]  Yeah?
[37:57.290 --> 37:57.910]  Like Stuart?
[37:58.610 --> 38:01.630]  No, just like, just drunk in public.
[38:03.270 --> 38:03.710]  Oh.
[38:04.050 --> 38:05.910]  I should have just calmed down a little bit.
[38:05.930 --> 38:11.230]  That day, we were walking out to go see Jason and Nick Saldana because they were at the game too.
[38:11.570 --> 38:15.090]  And I don't know if you remember this, but you bumped into a dude who ended up being a fan
[38:15.090 --> 38:16.890]  and you spilled a drink all down him too.
[38:18.570 --> 38:20.530]  Or like his dad. I think it might have been his dad.
[38:20.530 --> 38:21.430]  You're sure you weren't a character?
[38:22.330 --> 38:25.590]  No. And that was me trying to hold it together.
[38:25.990 --> 38:27.250]  You were. You were trying to hold it together.
[38:28.070 --> 38:29.590]  Definitely trying. Definitely failing.
[38:30.290 --> 38:34.810]  And you were just screaming, you were just yelling Tottenham Hot Spurs chants the whole time.
[38:34.990 --> 38:36.510]  Yeah, yeah. Come on you Spurs.
[38:36.850 --> 38:37.090]  Yeah.
[38:37.490 --> 38:39.110]  But in the football chant.
[38:39.550 --> 38:40.450]  It was pretty fucking funny.
[38:41.450 --> 38:44.010]  Apparently I knew Stuart a lot earlier than I realized.
[38:44.010 --> 38:48.570]  No, I see Stuart... Stuart was never trying to hold it together.
[38:50.310 --> 38:53.150]  2013 Gavin was a bumbling fucker, that's for sure.
[38:55.310 --> 38:58.170]  It's been a... I think we're in the alter ego era.
[38:58.490 --> 39:06.450]  I mean, in the last few weeks, we've had Errol, Stuart and Ramscoop all take on personalities of their own.
[39:07.310 --> 39:12.770]  Do we know what Ramscoop does outside of scoop ice cream with a glove?
[39:12.770 --> 39:16.650]  I think that's definitely our foundation and then we'll build up from there.
[39:16.910 --> 39:19.290]  Okay, well, that's the starting point.
[39:19.430 --> 39:25.610]  Eric wants to be in a new era right now. He wants to be in the summer of 98. He wants it to be the fuckface summer of 98.
[39:26.570 --> 39:32.950]  I've been... I don't know what it is, but like 1998 in my head is like, man, what a cool summer that was.
[39:33.310 --> 39:40.110]  We were... we were at Lazer Tag and Millie won a bunch of tickets and it was like, oh, what should I get?
[39:40.110 --> 39:44.650]  And they had those hats. It was like Dr. Seuss looking hats. You know what I'm talking about?
[39:44.710 --> 39:45.950]  The cat in the hat hats. Yeah.
[39:46.170 --> 39:50.310]  Yeah, like that big... they had like that big hat and she's like, oh, I'm going to get... she got one.
[39:50.470 --> 39:52.350]  And then I got jealous and I got one.
[39:53.730 --> 40:01.830]  And I just kept going like the last time you could wear this like was in 1998 and you would listen to 311 and you were like the coolest guy ever.
[40:02.090 --> 40:09.390]  And then today we had Diet Coke and I don't think I've had a Diet Coke since... and I said summer of 98.
[40:09.390 --> 40:18.530]  And then Geoff said summer of 98 and then went, oh, and then wrote it down. I don't know what it... I'm back. 98. That's it.
[40:18.670 --> 40:21.950]  I think we got to do summer of 98 this summer. Let's figure that out.
[40:21.950 --> 40:24.610]  I'm in. 2023 is the summer of 98.
[40:24.890 --> 40:30.130]  I just love that. The idea of a debate. Seasonal. Summer of 98.
[40:32.170 --> 40:40.410]  And also with our age gap is very different. Our summer of 98s collectively are very different experiences. I'm four.
[40:40.650 --> 40:48.710]  We were talking about that because I was 12. And so like listening to the radio, trying to learn how to do a kickflip, wearing one of those hats and drinking a Diet Coke.
[40:48.830 --> 40:53.230]  Like that was... it was awesome going to Belmont Park and it was just... it was great.
[40:53.390 --> 40:59.190]  And then Emily went, Geoff, how old are you in the summer of 98? And then Geoff, you say 23?
[40:59.190 --> 41:04.630]  I was like 98. Summer of 98. That's when I got out of the army. I had just done my five years in the army.
[41:05.670 --> 41:08.130]  I was 23. I just turned 23 years old.
[41:10.330 --> 41:12.330]  And what were you doing in the summer of 98?
[41:12.530 --> 41:15.410]  I was on tour with a ska punk band.
[41:15.890 --> 41:22.510]  My body was catching up to my head was summer of 98 based on that baby photo. Like I think I probably just got the balance right.
[41:22.610 --> 41:24.750]  You were building the calf strength to hold your head up.
[41:25.210 --> 41:30.210]  And I think when I was 23, I was spilling beer on people at a basketball game.
[41:34.690 --> 41:38.830]  I probably have footage of me in the summer of 98. I should try and find it.
[41:39.850 --> 41:45.090]  This ties into another idea. We should talk about this after the show. I'm excited about this. Summer of 98.
[41:45.170 --> 41:49.970]  I'm excited too because Eric was saying that we should listen to... we should really get into music from 98.
[41:49.970 --> 41:53.690]  Maybe watch a movie from 98 together. Like what was popular in 98?
[41:53.830 --> 41:56.490]  That would have been like I Know What You Did Last Summer maybe?
[41:56.770 --> 41:57.750]  Somewhere around that era.
[41:58.970 --> 42:00.090]  It was a good movie.
[42:00.450 --> 42:01.310]  I never saw that one.
[42:01.590 --> 42:01.810]  Really?
[42:02.010 --> 42:04.770]  It's a weird gap in my... yeah, I've seen like...
[42:04.770 --> 42:07.010]  I took Millie to see it in the theater a couple years ago.
[42:07.290 --> 42:08.390]  It still holds up? It's still good?
[42:08.670 --> 42:09.370]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[42:10.050 --> 42:11.970]  How many of those are there? There are like five?
[42:12.330 --> 42:13.390]  I've only seen the first one.
[42:13.570 --> 42:13.770]  Oh.
[42:14.150 --> 42:16.590]  Oh, Rush Hour came out in 98.
[42:16.710 --> 42:17.250]  Oh, really?
[42:17.550 --> 42:17.910]  Wow.
[42:17.910 --> 42:20.670]  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. You've Got Mail.
[42:21.270 --> 42:23.250]  Ooh, Fallen. That was a great movie.
[42:24.930 --> 42:33.530]  I think the thing that I remember was a radio station called Star 100.7 in San Diego had a thing called...
[42:33.530 --> 42:35.630]  I think it was called Whirl Till You Hurl.
[42:35.630 --> 42:43.550]  And it was these like eight people on this old roller coaster that would like...
[42:43.550 --> 42:49.150]  You know, you just keep riding it and the winner who can ride it the longest wins a car or whatever.
[42:49.370 --> 42:54.450]  And they thought it would go on for like two days or whatever.
[42:54.670 --> 42:56.990]  They rode it 18,000 times.
[42:57.470 --> 42:58.450]  Oh my god.
[42:58.610 --> 42:59.470]  Oh my god.
[43:02.850 --> 43:03.970]  18,000.
[43:04.850 --> 43:10.450]  It was like, it was insane. It was insane. It just kept going and going. It was like all summer long.
[43:10.770 --> 43:14.190]  I just remember it going all summer long. It was so cool.
[43:14.550 --> 43:15.930]  That's like Superfan Jack stuff.
[43:16.070 --> 43:18.770]  That was somebody's summer in 98 was just riding that ride.
[43:18.970 --> 43:20.230]  It was the entirety of it.
[43:20.610 --> 43:21.430]  That's crazy.
[43:21.550 --> 43:25.970]  Trying to puke. I like the idea of somebody wanting to like get out of it by vomiting, but they can't.
[43:26.610 --> 43:28.990]  They're just stuck. They hate the experience.
[43:30.050 --> 43:30.910]  That's a ridiculous contest.
[43:30.910 --> 43:34.470]  When I was 18, I went to, I was in the army.
[43:34.870 --> 43:37.670]  My best friend at the time, he was stationed in Germany.
[43:38.050 --> 43:42.030]  Like we had gone through journalism school together and then he'd been stationed in Germany and I was in Texas.
[43:42.650 --> 43:46.290]  And he was married to another soldier and they lived in Heidelberg.
[43:47.230 --> 43:50.890]  And so I went on vacation. I spent a month with him.
[43:51.650 --> 43:58.310]  I've probably told stories in the past about how the wheels broke on my plane and we got stranded in Iceland for five days.
[43:58.390 --> 44:00.290]  And I was briefly AWOL and it was a whole thing.
[44:00.950 --> 44:03.470]  I think I've told those stories in like old RT podcasts or whatever.
[44:03.670 --> 44:07.370]  But the month that we were there, they had like a summer festival.
[44:08.350 --> 44:11.950]  And so we went to it and it was kind of like this, like a state fair kind of thing.
[44:11.970 --> 44:19.570]  And they had like shitty carnival rides that, you know, some guy comes in with a lot of bad tattoos.
[44:19.570 --> 44:23.450]  And he sets up in one night and then you just pray that they don't fall apart while you're on it, you know.
[44:23.650 --> 44:25.410]  And there was like a little roller coaster like that.
[44:25.670 --> 44:30.070]  And we got on it and his wife got really sick.
[44:30.070 --> 44:34.950]  And every time we'd go around this one curve, she would throw up like in her lap.
[44:35.550 --> 44:39.390]  And we were stuck on the roller coaster, right? We couldn't get off.
[44:40.110 --> 44:41.950]  And so she threw up like eight times, right?
[44:42.130 --> 44:44.470]  And she was laughing about it the whole time. We were all like 18, 19.
[44:44.650 --> 44:47.790]  It was like, it wasn't fun to throw up, but we were, it was so ludicrous.
[44:47.870 --> 44:49.470]  We were kind of laughing about it. She's like, I'm not gonna throw up.
[44:49.510 --> 44:50.910]  I did it again, you know.
[44:51.210 --> 44:56.830]  But then we got off and we were like, I guess we should go home and clean you up.
[44:56.830 --> 45:00.870]  And I was like, it's kind of a shame because I bet people are going to sit in that puke.
[45:01.110 --> 45:04.110]  And then we were like, and she was like, you know what? You're right. Let's stick around.
[45:04.270 --> 45:11.370]  And so we, while she was covered in puke for a little while, we stood and watched people go in, get into the thing, sit down in her puke, go, Oh God!
[45:11.490 --> 45:14.970]  And get up and leave. And we watched probably like 10 people sit in her puke.
[45:15.410 --> 45:17.850]  Oh God.
[45:18.730 --> 45:19.530]  That's my story.
[45:20.390 --> 45:20.750]  God.
[45:22.370 --> 45:23.690]  That would ruin my day.
[45:24.190 --> 45:25.610]  Ruined a lot of people's day that day.
[45:25.610 --> 45:26.190]  Yeah.
[45:26.450 --> 45:28.090]  It was night. Ruined a lot of nights.
[45:28.630 --> 45:30.090]  Oh, that makes it even worse.
[45:30.510 --> 45:33.990]  I had the opposite of my day being ruined. Are you ready?
[45:34.490 --> 45:34.690]  Yeah.
[45:34.870 --> 45:35.210]  Uh-huh.
[45:35.830 --> 45:36.710]  Finally happened.
[45:37.310 --> 45:37.750]  Hey!
[45:37.950 --> 45:43.010]  Cosmic Chris Follett, they accept your existence. They acknowledge that you're real.
[45:43.210 --> 45:44.690]  Happy birthday, buddy. Hell yeah.
[45:45.650 --> 45:46.850]  Yeah, it was the day after my birthday.
[45:47.050 --> 45:47.770]  They're so wonderful.
[45:48.310 --> 45:55.290]  Not only are they, not only are they a great Apple, but their PR team was like defending us in comments on Twitter.
[45:55.290 --> 45:56.390]  I thought that was very cool.
[45:57.110 --> 45:57.550]  Yes.
[45:59.010 --> 46:04.930]  It's very funny. What, did you do something that, like, did they engage with a tweet or something of yours? Or was it random?
[46:05.230 --> 46:06.550]  No, I didn't really even tweet.
[46:06.930 --> 46:10.130]  Yeah, that's great. The fact that they just randomly did that.
[46:10.570 --> 46:10.710]  Yeah.
[46:10.710 --> 46:14.130]  I wonder what made them turn. I wonder if it's a ramscoop thing.
[46:14.970 --> 46:15.810]  Yeah, I don't know.
[46:15.950 --> 46:16.850]  They can get behind ramscoop.
[46:17.790 --> 46:24.210]  And then they'll unfollow after listening to what ramscoop does. It was very short-lived them being into it.
[46:24.830 --> 46:34.030]  I think I'm going to work on a prototype for the ice cream gloves. I think I can get that done. And it'll be my second glove for F*** Face.
[46:34.630 --> 46:36.770]  Maybe you're, like, the glove master.
[46:38.010 --> 46:39.610]  Yeah, maybe I'm hands man.
[46:39.990 --> 46:46.470]  Yeah, that's interesting. I didn't think about us having, like, areas of expertise, but that makes a lot of sense.
[46:46.710 --> 46:49.170]  If you had to be an expert on a different part of the body, what would it be?
[46:49.510 --> 46:49.710]  Oh.
[46:50.570 --> 46:51.830]  Andrew's the back man, obviously.
[46:51.830 --> 47:05.330]  Yeah, it has to be. Like, it's definitely not head. It's either the back or ankles. And I feel a lot better about my ankles. Or my back. But I know more about my ankles, I'd say.
[47:05.930 --> 47:06.390]  What do you mean?
[47:07.250 --> 47:19.410]  Well, I've had to, like... I deal with my ankles more than I do my back. My back is perfect. Maybe nose. I've got an unbreakable nose. That might be my expertise.
[47:19.410 --> 47:27.770]  I think we need a diagram of the human body, and then we have to, like, color code which parts that we're the expert. Because you've got so many. You've got back, ankles, and nose.
[47:28.130 --> 47:44.590]  Yeah, but there's a lot of distance. There's a lot of grey between those spots. I've got, like, very bright ankles, very bright back. Completely, like, fucking Rudolph level of nose. And then everything else is pretty blank, I would say.
[47:46.050 --> 47:55.110]  I would only... I think I only... I would pick mouth, I guess. Because I spend a lot of time medically dealing with my mouth.
[47:56.190 --> 47:59.930]  But you have nose flaps. And I feel like that almost forces you.
[48:00.030 --> 48:05.670]  I do have nose flaps. But we haven't tested the efficacy of the nose flap yet.
[48:05.930 --> 48:06.630]  When are we doing that?
[48:06.850 --> 48:08.570]  As soon as we get the Strom Strom.
[48:08.570 --> 48:18.030]  At the time of this recording, I believe it's next week. Which, if you're listening to this, this will come out... Nick, this comes out the week of, like, the 29th, right?
[48:19.130 --> 48:20.870]  No, this comes out the week of the 5th.
[48:21.070 --> 48:22.570]  This comes out the week of the 5th?
[48:22.650 --> 48:22.850]  Yeah.
[48:23.410 --> 48:24.350]  Then we've already done it.
[48:24.550 --> 48:24.910]  Wow!
[48:25.890 --> 48:26.370]  There you go.
[48:26.530 --> 48:28.610]  So, Geoff, what do you think? Expertise, yes or no?
[48:28.810 --> 48:29.090]  Yes.
[48:29.770 --> 48:29.970]  Okay.
[48:30.830 --> 48:33.070]  Okay, so the 5th, it comes out on the 5th?
[48:33.490 --> 48:34.930]  It comes out on the 6th.
[48:34.930 --> 48:39.770]  The 6th, okay. That's our birthday. It was three days prior to this.
[48:40.030 --> 48:40.930]  Yeah, the June 3rd, right?
[48:41.630 --> 48:43.170]  Our show birthday. Yeah, June 3rd.
[48:43.570 --> 48:44.350]  Happy birthday, guys.
[48:45.010 --> 48:46.550]  Happy birthday to us.
[48:47.310 --> 48:51.330]  What season does that put us in? Are we still in season 6?
[48:51.850 --> 48:57.290]  I don't know. We're year 3 now, I guess. The start of year 3. I'm not sure about the season thing.
[48:57.290 --> 49:06.610]  The last time we fucked with seasons, we were in season 6, but I feel like this is... I don't know that we're in summer season.
[49:07.010 --> 49:07.730]  Season 98?
[49:08.230 --> 49:13.170]  Yeah, season 98. I feel like we're going straight to 98 from 6?
[49:13.490 --> 49:17.870]  Yeah, it's like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 98, then we'll hit 7 somewhere in the fall.
[49:18.450 --> 49:24.950]  I think that's fun. Let the people decide where the other seasons started and ended. Just know that we're now on 98.
[49:24.950 --> 49:31.070]  Yeah, we're season 98. Summer season 98. I like that. I like that a lot, actually.
[49:31.350 --> 49:31.910]  I think that fits.
[49:32.670 --> 49:38.870]  I have a question for you, Geoff, just because your fiancé works in the hair industry.
[49:39.750 --> 49:39.950]  Yeah.
[49:40.390 --> 49:49.390]  What is the second pair of scissors used that just pulls all my hair out? What is that for?
[49:49.850 --> 49:56.150]  I'm getting a haircut, there's just normal scissors, chop, chop, chop. Oh, let me use these other scissors that just hurt. What is that doing?
[49:56.490 --> 49:59.350]  The dullest scissors ever made. I never understood that.
[49:59.490 --> 50:00.750]  Is it meant to rip my hair out?
[50:02.590 --> 50:14.370]  I would imagine not. I don't fucking know, because I'm not a hair expert, she is. But she's also not here right now, so I can't ask her, but I'll have to put a pin in that, I'll get back to you on it.
[50:14.490 --> 50:15.050]  I would love to know.
[50:15.050 --> 50:23.170]  I will say that Emily cuts my hair, and she's been cutting my hair for, you know, five, six years now, and I have never felt pain from her cutting my hair. It's never hurt.
[50:23.510 --> 50:26.010]  Huh. It's for taking the bulk out.
[50:26.250 --> 50:32.050]  So it might be shitty, it might be that you're getting your haircut for $15 somewhere, and they have dull scissors.
[50:33.230 --> 50:41.950]  I want to say, nature and time is taking the bulk out. I don't need a special pair of scissors to be doing any thinning.
[50:41.950 --> 50:45.090]  So it layers, and it can sit differently on your head.
[50:45.250 --> 50:55.490]  I will say, I do remember when I was gluing your head hair all over my face, that I remember being very thick and straw-like, your hair.
[50:56.070 --> 50:57.170]  Uh, pretty coarse.
[50:57.530 --> 50:58.510]  Yeah, pretty coarse.
[50:59.350 --> 51:03.670]  Well, I mean, that was nothing... I had your beard, didn't I?
[51:04.670 --> 51:11.610]  I had... no, you had my pubes on your... as a mohawk or something? How did that work?
[51:12.210 --> 51:15.150]  I thought it was your... I thought I had a mohawk of your beard.
[51:15.950 --> 51:23.630]  Yeah, that was it. You had a mohawk of my beard. I had a head... I had your head hair on my beard. I replaced my beard with your head hair.
[51:24.290 --> 51:27.770]  We saw truth for a moment. You thought it was beard hair this entire time.
[51:27.770 --> 51:32.070]  Geoff has been presenting this as beard hair. We just saw a glimmer of truth.
[51:34.050 --> 51:36.010]  It's a real adjustment. That was funny.
[51:36.350 --> 51:37.470]  Back when we were young and dumb.
[51:38.430 --> 51:39.910]  Eric and I came up with a game.
[51:40.410 --> 51:41.250]  Ooh! Okay.
[51:41.490 --> 51:45.810]  We were opening cards yesterday on the break show, uh...
[51:47.530 --> 51:50.030]  That we would like to do more often than once.
[51:50.350 --> 51:53.610]  We will, we will do it more often. Don't worry about it. We'll get to that later.
[51:54.010 --> 51:59.510]  Uh, okay. Anyway, we were doing it yesterday, uh, for the... to celebrate the launch of the vinyl.
[52:01.250 --> 52:01.970]  And, uh...
[52:01.970 --> 52:02.490]  How did that go?
[52:02.970 --> 52:05.050]  Uh, great! The vinyl...
[52:05.770 --> 52:06.490]  Unmitigated success!
[52:06.910 --> 52:09.990]  It sold out very fast. Way faster than I think either of us thought it would.
[52:10.350 --> 52:11.050]  We were... we were...
[52:11.550 --> 52:14.350]  Listen, we can cover that shit in a sausage talk if you want to.
[52:14.410 --> 52:14.570]  Okay.
[52:14.890 --> 52:17.070]  I have lots... I have notes written down for it.
[52:17.170 --> 52:21.030]  It seemed to be a phenomenal response to the point where even Andrew didn't get one.
[52:21.390 --> 52:22.290]  I missed out.
[52:22.470 --> 52:25.070]  Wes Ellis was in... was in...
[52:25.070 --> 52:27.190]  While we were recording, we had four on the wall.
[52:27.570 --> 52:31.490]  And it was mine, yours, Andrew's, and Nick's.
[52:31.690 --> 52:32.930]  Eric already has his.
[52:33.250 --> 52:35.410]  So we only had four copies in Rooster Teeth.
[52:35.790 --> 52:38.010]  And Wes Ellis and a bunch of other people were like,
[52:38.050 --> 52:39.470]  I really want one of those. Can I get one of those?
[52:39.590 --> 52:40.970]  And they were like hovering around.
[52:41.290 --> 52:42.670]  And we had to protect them. We had to be like,
[52:42.710 --> 52:44.210]  No, these are our copies.
[52:45.090 --> 52:47.630]  And I was going to give them my personal one,
[52:48.030 --> 52:50.410]  but I thought I might still need it for stuff.
[52:50.410 --> 52:52.670]  Like, for set stuff. So I'm going to hold on to it.
[52:53.290 --> 52:54.770]  But yeah, it was like...
[52:54.770 --> 52:56.730]  People in the company were like clamoring to get it.
[52:56.770 --> 52:58.190]  Which is wild, because...
[52:58.190 --> 52:58.990]  That's crazy.
[52:59.490 --> 53:01.810]  It's for a medium that almost no one can play.
[53:02.990 --> 53:05.450]  For an episode that's not special in any way,
[53:05.550 --> 53:08.630]  and that is publicly available in a better quality format for free.
[53:09.330 --> 53:09.870]  And longer.
[53:10.270 --> 53:12.710]  And longer. And at the appropriate speed.
[53:13.590 --> 53:14.730]  But yeah, it was a phenomenal response.
[53:14.810 --> 53:16.550]  And obviously we're getting some more...
[53:16.550 --> 53:17.950]  We're getting it repressed.
[53:18.470 --> 53:20.570]  And I probably shouldn't say it,
[53:20.570 --> 53:22.270]  but this will be in the future.
[53:22.290 --> 53:24.530]  So I think we're looking for it to launch sometime.
[53:24.610 --> 53:25.930]  I think we're going to get it sometime in September.
[53:26.310 --> 53:28.010]  So we'll communicate that when it comes out.
[53:28.630 --> 53:29.250]  The second pressing.
[53:30.050 --> 53:31.850]  We're printing another 500, and then that's it.
[53:31.910 --> 53:32.830]  We're moving on from this bit.
[53:33.290 --> 53:35.770]  I saw some of the best outrage.
[53:36.990 --> 53:39.010]  Because obviously people are sad they didn't get it.
[53:39.150 --> 53:39.410]  But also...
[53:39.410 --> 53:40.270]  I totally get that.
[53:40.630 --> 53:42.350]  They're face regulation listeners,
[53:42.590 --> 53:45.390]  so they're very much in on the joke and funny.
[53:45.390 --> 53:47.350]  But I saw one comment saying,
[53:47.410 --> 53:49.830]  I had it, and I had it in my car,
[53:49.950 --> 53:51.410]  and it was scrumped from my car.
[53:52.050 --> 53:52.910]  I just love that.
[53:54.350 --> 53:56.010]  Even through the noise,
[53:56.710 --> 53:58.610]  there's still a part of it.
[53:58.770 --> 53:59.770]  We're going to do our damnedest
[54:00.870 --> 54:02.330]  to unscrump that for people.
[54:02.570 --> 54:02.710]  Yeah.
[54:03.390 --> 54:04.650]  And also, just so you know,
[54:04.830 --> 54:06.410]  we also ordered more no-scrumping signs
[54:06.410 --> 54:08.230]  and more Falcon signs.
[54:08.490 --> 54:10.210]  Which, by the way, I still can't believe
[54:10.210 --> 54:11.990]  that Falcon sign sold out as quickly as it did.
[54:11.990 --> 54:14.190]  I really didn't think that bit had it.
[54:14.310 --> 54:16.630]  It sold out faster than the no-scrumping sign.
[54:17.070 --> 54:18.810]  Which I think was a way stronger bit.
[54:20.970 --> 54:21.750]  Yeah, it was ridiculous.
[54:21.750 --> 54:22.350]  Was it a volume thing?
[54:22.950 --> 54:24.830]  Were there like six Falcon signs?
[54:25.350 --> 54:27.310]  Yeah, there were six Falcon signs.
[54:27.310 --> 54:28.310]  I think there were 500.
[54:29.390 --> 54:32.110]  First of all, that was so much fucking tone
[54:32.110 --> 54:34.170]  when we're selling ten of one type of Gerpler.
[54:34.670 --> 54:36.330]  You acted like that was a sane statement.
[54:36.330 --> 54:36.550]  We're selling ten of a Gerpler.
[54:36.730 --> 54:38.870]  No, no, no, that's a bonus Gerpler.
[54:39.610 --> 54:40.630]  No, there's ten.
[54:40.710 --> 54:42.710]  We're selling a thousand and ten.
[54:42.830 --> 54:44.010]  Ten of them are special.
[54:44.810 --> 54:46.230]  Yeah, but there's only ten of them.
[54:46.530 --> 54:48.950]  So I'm just saying six isn't a ridiculous statement.
[54:49.290 --> 54:51.510]  If there were, why even argue it?
[54:51.590 --> 54:52.250]  Why even argue it?
[54:52.250 --> 54:53.910]  Why don't you argue with him?
[54:54.110 --> 54:54.770]  I don't want to.
[54:54.970 --> 54:58.410]  It's for this show, completely appropriate.
[54:58.830 --> 55:00.510]  This is not an arena
[55:00.510 --> 55:02.130]  Eric wants to argue in right now.
[55:02.250 --> 55:03.570]  I think we made 100 signs.
[55:03.790 --> 55:06.390]  I went comedically low, but I still think
[55:06.390 --> 55:08.370]  100 seems incredibly low.
[55:08.570 --> 55:10.070]  I don't think we did 100.
[55:10.230 --> 55:10.730]  We did more.
[55:11.330 --> 55:12.890]  Are you talking about the falcon signs?
[55:13.130 --> 55:15.250]  We made 500 falcon signs.
[55:15.410 --> 55:16.690]  There are 500 falcon signs?
[55:17.450 --> 55:18.830]  And I also didn't get one.
[55:19.050 --> 55:21.150]  I think that's the only piece of merch I don't have.
[55:21.730 --> 55:22.570]  Shout out to the audience.
[55:22.910 --> 55:25.370]  I think we're going to have to bump our limited run number.
[55:25.610 --> 55:26.690]  We're definitely going to bump our...
[55:26.690 --> 55:29.410]  It's complicated. It's not as easy as you would think.
[55:29.870 --> 55:31.730]  We'll definitely not be doing pre-orders
[55:31.730 --> 55:33.230]  for a lot of legal reasons.
[55:33.230 --> 55:34.590]  I've been down that road before.
[55:34.990 --> 55:37.070]  Anyway, all that stuff could be covered in a sausage talk
[55:37.070 --> 55:39.190]  because I took copious notes to kind of explain
[55:39.190 --> 55:41.310]  the theory behind it all and why we do things the way we do.
[55:41.850 --> 55:43.210]  The point is, we were doing
[55:43.210 --> 55:45.250]  the Break Show yesterday, and we were opening
[55:45.250 --> 55:47.310]  up these music cards. We've opened them up
[55:47.310 --> 55:49.570]  before. They're kind of dog shit,
[55:49.930 --> 55:51.310]  but I had landed on an idea
[55:51.310 --> 55:53.230]  that made it funny to me, and then
[55:53.230 --> 55:55.230]  Eric took that idea and ran with it and made it way
[55:55.230 --> 55:57.290]  better, and we were thinking, we were just opening
[55:57.290 --> 55:58.730]  up these cards, and it's like, one
[55:59.190 --> 56:00.570]  card will be Belle Biv Devoe,
[56:00.570 --> 56:02.710]  the next one will be Testament,
[56:03.050 --> 56:04.890]  the next is Patsy Cline,
[56:05.230 --> 56:06.650]  the next is
[56:06.650 --> 56:08.410]  the Scorpions,
[56:08.810 --> 56:10.950]  and it's just musician after musician
[56:10.950 --> 56:12.530]  all across the map, right?
[56:12.550 --> 56:14.370]  And it's like, Patti LaBelle, and you're like, okay.
[56:16.490 --> 56:18.670]  Eric was thinking, we should do
[56:18.670 --> 56:20.730]  a thing where we all get together and we each
[56:20.730 --> 56:22.670]  open three packs,
[56:22.990 --> 56:24.670]  and from those three packs,
[56:24.790 --> 56:26.770]  we get to make the best
[56:26.770 --> 56:28.650]  playlist we can on Spotify.
[56:28.650 --> 56:30.290]  You get to pick 10 songs
[56:30.290 --> 56:32.750]  from the 30 cards, and you have to make the best
[56:32.750 --> 56:34.410]  playlist, and then we compete
[56:34.410 --> 56:36.830]  against each other, and we release them all,
[56:36.910 --> 56:38.550]  make a f***face Spotify, we have
[56:38.550 --> 56:40.730]  Eric's playlist, Gavin's, Geoff's, Nick's,
[56:40.830 --> 56:42.790]  the other one, Andrew, and then
[56:42.790 --> 56:44.630]  the audience can vote on who has
[56:44.630 --> 56:46.710]  the best playlist. And does it work like
[56:46.710 --> 56:48.530]  a draft? Like, we can't have the same songs?
[56:49.530 --> 56:50.310]  Yeah, well,
[56:50.470 --> 56:52.490]  because we might get the same,
[56:52.570 --> 56:54.710]  we might both get Def Leppard, right?
[56:54.750 --> 56:56.650]  Or Nelson. And so, to me,
[56:56.650 --> 56:58.910]  yeah, we can't have the same songs,
[56:59.090 --> 57:00.850]  so I think we'd have to go in order,
[57:00.990 --> 57:02.390]  but I think it would also have to be
[57:02.390 --> 57:04.950]  sort of a, like, behind closed
[57:04.950 --> 57:06.670]  doors where we're trying to, like, put it together,
[57:06.850 --> 57:08.850]  and then bringing it, and if we both have
[57:08.850 --> 57:10.990]  the same song, there has
[57:10.990 --> 57:12.770]  to be, like, some kind of argument about it,
[57:12.790 --> 57:14.870]  or we have to, somebody has to drop
[57:14.870 --> 57:16.690]  it. There's... How about this?
[57:16.750 --> 57:18.830]  Sort of gray area in the rules. How about this?
[57:19.650 --> 57:20.750]  If there's, like, say
[57:20.750 --> 57:22.450]  you both picked, like, Nelson.
[57:23.890 --> 57:24.250]  Right.
[57:24.690 --> 57:25.990]  I only bring that up because they were,
[57:26.190 --> 57:26.970]  they came up yesterday.
[57:28.170 --> 57:30.110]  And it's, like, good luck trying to figure out what the best
[57:30.110 --> 57:31.650]  Nelson song is, to put it on a fucking count.
[57:32.130 --> 57:33.790]  But if you both show up with Nelson,
[57:34.210 --> 57:35.430]  then you have to paper, rock, scissors.
[57:36.670 --> 57:38.130]  Oh, that's good. Keeping it easy.
[57:38.290 --> 57:40.050]  Yeah. Proper scissors, not the, like,
[57:40.110 --> 57:41.690]  the shitty ones that Gavin was talking about.
[57:44.430 --> 57:46.170]  Dull-ass scissors. Not hair-thinning scissors.
[57:46.350 --> 57:48.310]  Gavin never grows scissors, because they suck.
[57:48.410 --> 57:49.750]  They're terrible. He's got the dull scissors.
[57:50.510 --> 57:52.190]  Anyway, and then so we, then we have,
[57:52.190 --> 57:54.610]  we basically create, like, a game out of it.
[57:55.190 --> 57:56.270]  Uh, and then we release
[57:56.270 --> 57:58.570]  the playlist, and then the audience can pick what the best playlist is.
[57:58.690 --> 58:00.310]  I love it. I like it too.
[58:00.450 --> 58:01.310]  I think it's, I think it's really good.
[58:01.310 --> 58:03.530]  Like, the cards are so crazy.
[58:04.010 --> 58:06.390]  The stuff that you pull is not,
[58:06.430 --> 58:08.010]  like, we ended up getting a
[58:08.010 --> 58:10.410]  Cro-Mags card, and that is, like,
[58:10.470 --> 58:12.450]  the most aggro fucking band.
[58:12.530 --> 58:14.330]  Yeah. Like, why do they have a card
[58:14.330 --> 58:16.750]  in this thing? Non-commercial. Not in any way.
[58:16.870 --> 58:18.170]  Yeah. Like, doesn't make any sense
[58:18.170 --> 58:19.510]  that they would make the cut.
[58:20.090 --> 58:20.810]  It's crazy.
[58:20.890 --> 58:23.490]  Do you think that's their rookie card? Do you think it's a Cro-Mags
[58:23.490 --> 58:25.030]  rookie, or is there something prior to that?
[58:25.050 --> 58:26.970]  They were deep into the band at that point.
[58:27.050 --> 58:29.350]  I told Eric a fucking story about Harley
[58:29.350 --> 58:31.330]  Flanagan, the guy in the Cro-Mags, that I won't bother
[58:31.330 --> 58:33.190]  telling on the podcast, but it's just an insane,
[58:33.550 --> 58:35.210]  insane story of a time, of
[58:35.210 --> 58:37.370]  a day I met him. Did the Meat Men
[58:37.370 --> 58:39.370]  show up? No, the Meat Men
[58:39.370 --> 58:41.430]  were nowhere to be found. Although I have seen the Meat Men
[58:41.430 --> 58:43.450]  play before. Uh, maybe they'll have a
[58:43.450 --> 58:45.390]  card, and then maybe you can add them
[58:45.390 --> 58:47.190]  to the band. Like, you can add
[58:47.190 --> 58:49.130]  one down, three to go, which is a song about the Beatles.
[58:50.730 --> 58:51.390]  Oh man,
[58:51.450 --> 58:52.570]  really? Yeah.
[58:54.250 --> 58:54.610]  Jesus!
[58:55.190 --> 58:55.950]  I saw that dude
[58:57.130 --> 58:59.210]  beating people up in a riot once, that I
[58:59.210 --> 58:59.790]  was a part of.
[59:01.950 --> 59:03.170]  It was the scariest, maybe
[59:03.170 --> 59:04.870]  one of the scariest days of my life.
[59:06.290 --> 59:06.990]  I saw somebody
[59:06.990 --> 59:08.970]  kick him so hard in the face, I thought it killed him.
[59:10.170 --> 59:11.030]  Oh my god!
[59:12.970 --> 59:14.450]  The Cro-Mags guy? Yeah.
[59:16.070 --> 59:16.590]  That's...
[59:16.590 --> 59:18.550]  I don't want to know anything else about them.
[59:18.810 --> 59:20.530]  I saw him rip
[59:20.530 --> 59:22.210]  a board off of the exterior
[59:22.210 --> 59:24.430]  wall of a store, and then start
[59:24.430 --> 59:25.770]  beating people with it.
[59:26.910 --> 59:27.950]  Dad checks
[59:27.950 --> 59:30.290]  from his trading card. Yeah, yeah.
[59:30.550 --> 59:32.510]  His eyebrows just look like
[59:32.510 --> 59:34.130]  a V. Like, he is pissed.
[59:34.510 --> 59:36.390]  He is really mad. He looks like
[59:36.390 --> 59:38.490]  a character in those Bad Dudes cards
[59:38.490 --> 59:39.890]  we opened up. Yes!
[59:41.170 --> 59:42.470]  Like, snotty, like
[59:42.470 --> 59:44.330]  Harley snot face or something.
[59:44.570 --> 59:46.770]  Yeah. He looks
[59:46.770 --> 59:48.350]  Cro-Magnon. He
[59:48.350 --> 59:50.410]  kinda does. He kinda does. Yes.
[59:51.430 --> 59:52.650]  100%. It's crazy.
[59:53.750 --> 59:54.070]  Well,
[59:54.330 --> 59:56.670]  are we done? I think we're done.
[59:57.090 --> 59:57.590]  I think we're done.
[59:58.690 --> 01:00:00.210]  Yeah, we gotta do another one right after this.
[01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:02.110]  It feels like we did enough.
[01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:04.630]  Oh, can I, you know, a little addition, just to
[01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:06.490]  bring it up. Is that who he
[01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:07.130]  looks like to you, Nick?
[01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:09.770]  Is that a Dragon Ball guy?
[01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.950]  Yeah, Vegeta.
[01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:11.890]  Vegeta.
[01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:15.290]  Before we close out, a little chat.
[01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:16.710]  100 Signs.
[01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:19.390]  Oh, is that all it was?
[01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:21.830]  No way! They may have bumped it later,
[01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:23.590]  but that's what was listed. 100 Signs.
[01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:25.650]  Oh, wow. Andrew going back for the
[01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:27.690]  receipts. That's awesome. That's definitely not
[01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.170]  what I remember. That's not what I remember either.
[01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:31.750]  Now I know why Eric didn't want to argue.
[01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.750]  Oh, no, I wasn't
[01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:35.790]  gonna argue that. It was about the cups.
[01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:36.750]  I wasn't gonna argue about the cups.
[01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:37.410]  Oh.
[01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:40.290]  The signs are done. We'll have to go back and look.
[01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:42.330]  I do think that there were more
[01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:44.470]  than that, but you're right. It does say 100.
[01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:46.510]  I mean, it's lose-lose. I mean, when you're ordering
[01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:48.750]  Falcon Sides out...
[01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:51.090]  Everything is
[01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:51.810]  lose-lose, dude.
[01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:53.530]  How do you...
[01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:56.090]  I really like the idea that
[01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:58.450]  the people ordering the numbers
[01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:00.530]  for this have no context for where this is
[01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:02.590]  coming from, and just as a normal human
[01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:04.330]  being trying to decide how many
[01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:06.390]  people want a Beware Falcon sign?
[01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:07.710]  How many people want this?
[01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:09.390]  100 seems excessive.
[01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:12.150]  How many people want a 2-year-old middle
[01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:14.030]  episode of a podcast with 8 minutes?
[01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:15.390]  Well, it's like, we were right!
[01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:18.110]  You know, you make something like a skateboard,
[01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:20.370]  a VCK skateboard that you're really excited about
[01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:22.270]  that makes a lot of sense, and you actually get
[01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:24.210]  it out pretty quickly, and then
[01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:25.810]  people didn't buy it. And you're like,
[01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:27.930]  I don't know if I can take a risk on
[01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:30.170]  something as dumb as a Falcon sign if
[01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:32.030]  nobody buys the skateboard, which seems like a fuckin'
[01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:34.130]  home run. I love the fact
[01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:35.870]  that we can sell
[01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:38.110]  Falcon security signs
[01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:39.450]  but not skateboards.
[01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:42.370]  We ended up selling the skateboards
[01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:44.250]  and then people were like, oh man, I didn't get
[01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:46.050]  one. Bring them back. And it's like, you didn't
[01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:48.150]  They were available forever. It's the same
[01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:49.890]  way with the Tiki mugs. People are like,
[01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:52.030]  we bought a thousand of those
[01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:53.970]  Tiki mugs, we sold like 800 pretty quickly,
[01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:55.310]  and then we had 200
[01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:57.970]  sitting on the shelves costing us money
[01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:00.130]  for, it felt like, three months after
[01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:01.490]  that, but it might have been a little longer.
[01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:04.170]  It's like, it's such a
[01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:05.550]  delicate, it's such a delicate thing.
[01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:08.050]  I love it, and I love all the discussions that it
[01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:10.150]  causes internally, and none of
[01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:11.990]  it, when read, seems like it should be
[01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:13.950]  business or work, just because it's so absurd.
[01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:15.950]  But it's all actual real people doing
[01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:16.870]  their real jobs.
[01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:21.010]  Oh, it's the best.
[01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:24.050]  Thank you so much for listening to
[01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:26.190]  this episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.290]  It was the 157th
[01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:30.250]  time we've all sat down at our
[01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:32.490]  respective desks and hashed
[01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:34.230]  out a little argument, a little conversation,
[01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:36.210]  a little bit of friendship, a little bit of kinship,
[01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:38.230]  a little bit of love, and we hope you enjoyed it as well.
[01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:40.070]  If you did, maybe you'll tell somebody
[01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:42.450]  in your life that you love all about it.
[01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:44.410]  We think they might like it
[01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:46.270]  if you just don't introduce them
[01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:48.230]  with this episode. Maybe go back three
[01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:49.030]  or four.
[01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:52.190]  Unless they're into out of
[01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:54.250]  context. In that case, maybe this is an all-time great.
[01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:56.310]  Also, give us a
[01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:58.410]  review somewhere on a place that allows
[01:02:58.410 --> 01:03:00.130]  reviews. We would appreciate that. If it's
[01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:02.270]  positive. If it's negative, keep your f***ing
[01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:04.570]  opinions to yourself. Thank you very much. We'll see you next week.
[01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:06.170]  Hey guys.
[01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:08.350]  Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's
[01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:10.250]  episode of F*** Face. Check
[01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:12.230]  out our whoop tone. Here comes
[01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:14.410]  Errol. The gang invents more products.
[01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:15.910]  It's Pantin's pie.
[01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:18.310]  Someone fried the caterpillar. We get
[01:03:18.310 --> 01:03:20.390]  a mold update. What kind of bird is
[01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:22.370]  that? And once again, Andrew
[01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:24.170]  does not eat the pencil. All that
[01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:26.070]  and more on next week's episode of
[01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:26.610]  F*** Face.
