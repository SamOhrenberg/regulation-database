[00:10.380 --> 00:13.780]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:13.880 --> 00:15.880]  Geoff, get away from Gavin. Get away from Gavin.
[00:16.260 --> 00:17.480]  I think he's got a blindside.
[00:18.040 --> 00:19.140]  I think Gavin's got a blindside.
[00:19.600 --> 00:21.020]  Get away from him. Are you serious?
[00:21.020 --> 00:22.440]  Get away from him. I think so.
[00:23.100 --> 00:25.840]  You're about to be... blind...
[00:25.840 --> 00:26.740]  No, I don't have anything.
[00:27.100 --> 00:28.600]  I don't trust it. Nah.
[00:28.760 --> 00:32.180]  He's been texting me about cricket. I think he's gonna make us watch a cricket video.
[00:32.620 --> 00:34.720]  Are you gonna make such a f***ing cricket video?
[00:35.080 --> 00:36.760]  I think he's gonna make us watch a cricket video.
[00:37.060 --> 00:38.620]  No, I wouldn't do that to you. Why would I do that?
[00:38.620 --> 00:41.100]  I think he's blindsided. I don't trust it.
[00:41.320 --> 00:42.620]  If I get through the intro...
[00:43.200 --> 00:44.820]  If I get through the intro, he can't...
[00:45.340 --> 00:46.040]  We're in.
[00:46.340 --> 00:48.580]  Is there a window for calling the blindside?
[00:48.900 --> 00:50.600]  I think it's gotta be before the... We never established that.
[00:51.320 --> 00:52.600]  Well, we can establish it right now.
[00:53.180 --> 00:54.580]  That's a rule? I don't think...
[00:54.580 --> 00:56.420]  I think that's a bad rule. I vote no on that rule.
[00:56.420 --> 00:59.460]  So you wanna blindside somebody 45 minutes into a podcast?
[00:59.700 --> 01:00.740]  Yeah. Yeah, I do.
[01:01.280 --> 01:03.320]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:03.660 --> 01:04.280]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:04.280 --> 01:07.420]  That's where that goes. That's the kind of lawless chaos
[01:07.420 --> 01:09.220]  that we end up with if we do it that way.
[01:09.360 --> 01:09.580]  No.
[01:10.120 --> 01:13.320]  Listen, I think going forward...
[01:13.320 --> 01:15.060]  Gavin, do you have a blindside or do you not have a blindside?
[01:15.600 --> 01:15.840]  Nope.
[01:16.460 --> 01:17.440]  Okay, that was a bad read by me.
[01:19.060 --> 01:20.680]  Well, I mean, I didn't bring up cricket.
[01:20.880 --> 01:22.020]  You brought up baseball, didn't you?
[01:22.520 --> 01:24.860]  I don't know. It doesn't matter. That was a bad read by me.
[01:25.060 --> 01:27.720]  I think if somebody is going to blindside
[01:27.720 --> 01:29.760]  and they get called before they can deploy it,
[01:29.800 --> 01:30.660]  they lose their blindside.
[01:31.040 --> 01:31.360]  Wow.
[01:33.140 --> 01:34.360]  Can you call a blindside?
[01:34.360 --> 01:35.520]  That's what I'm about to say.
[01:35.780 --> 01:38.240]  Going forward, if you call it and you're wrong,
[01:38.300 --> 01:39.180]  you lose your blindside.
[01:39.360 --> 01:41.820]  So now that we've established the rules, we still all have blindsides,
[01:41.940 --> 01:42.360]  but Geoff,
[01:44.140 --> 01:45.820]  I think those are some important factors.
[01:46.020 --> 01:47.680]  So when do I get my blindside back?
[01:47.860 --> 01:49.520]  Once everybody else blindsides, I feel.
[01:49.800 --> 01:52.200]  Yeah, but what if Nick is fucking lazy
[01:52.200 --> 01:53.260]  and doesn't want a blindside?
[01:53.960 --> 01:55.000]  Does Nick have a blindside?
[01:55.160 --> 01:56.760]  Yeah, does Nick get a blindside?
[01:56.900 --> 01:58.040]  I didn't think Nick got a blindside.
[01:58.160 --> 02:00.120]  Oh, sorry, Nick, you're a second-class citizen.
[02:00.120 --> 02:01.400]  So it's just the three of us, then?
[02:02.120 --> 02:03.060]  Eric, go fuck yourself.
[02:03.440 --> 02:05.180]  I'm definitely not calling a blindside.
[02:05.380 --> 02:08.840]  I'm trying to get as many episodes of this show in the bank as I can.
[02:09.680 --> 02:10.480]  Okay, okay.
[02:10.860 --> 02:12.100]  So the three of us, then.
[02:12.340 --> 02:14.320]  So I have to wait, because I have another blindside
[02:14.780 --> 02:16.000]  queued up and ready to go.
[02:16.340 --> 02:18.000]  Does the audience know about blindside yet?
[02:18.380 --> 02:19.480]  I think it just came out.
[02:19.640 --> 02:22.400]  At this point, I believe blindside will have come out, yes.
[02:22.480 --> 02:22.840]  Okay.
[02:23.280 --> 02:25.560]  If not, then this whole thing needs to be removed.
[02:25.720 --> 02:27.220]  Hold on just a second.
[02:27.220 --> 02:29.400]  Episode 159, my name's Geoff Ramsey.
[02:29.460 --> 02:32.000]  With me, as always, Gavin and Andrew
[02:32.000 --> 02:32.920]  and Nick and Eric.
[02:33.060 --> 02:35.220]  Although they're less with us, apparently, because they don't get the blindside.
[02:35.800 --> 02:37.380]  Yeah. Obviously.
[02:37.720 --> 02:39.700]  You still mentioned blindside in the safe intro.
[02:40.160 --> 02:40.440]  Yeah.
[02:40.880 --> 02:42.760]  Well, we have to, because I want to talk about blindside.
[02:42.820 --> 02:44.300]  Well, I just wanted to get through the intro.
[02:45.400 --> 02:46.140]  It's possible.
[02:47.640 --> 02:49.260]  Andrew outed your non-blindside
[02:49.900 --> 02:51.080]  before I could finish
[02:51.500 --> 02:52.320]  saying who we were.
[02:52.520 --> 02:53.940]  We're not in another paranoid era.
[02:54.680 --> 02:55.800]  I don't want anyone
[02:55.800 --> 02:56.500]  to think that.
[02:57.900 --> 03:00.240]  What a regular way to say that.
[03:01.620 --> 03:02.140]  I've been
[03:02.140 --> 03:04.000]  thinking about it for a while, and I don't know if I have
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.080]  the energy for another paranoid phase.
[03:06.700 --> 03:06.820]  Yeah?
[03:07.980 --> 03:10.060]  Well, you initiated one, so you can't
[03:10.060 --> 03:11.960]  make that claim and then bring us into the
[03:11.960 --> 03:13.960]  era of paranoia. Yeah, you can't do a
[03:13.960 --> 03:15.760]  blindside and then not have the energy to even listen.
[03:16.320 --> 03:17.520]  Listen, listen.
[03:18.200 --> 03:19.720]  That's how I absolutely
[03:19.720 --> 03:22.160]  can. That's in my DNA.
[03:22.980 --> 03:23.380]  Yeah.
[03:24.320 --> 03:25.760]  You kind of just did.
[03:26.000 --> 03:27.860]  So we can't really say you can't.
[03:28.560 --> 03:30.240]  I have a question for Andrew.
[03:30.740 --> 03:31.080]  Yes.
[03:31.600 --> 03:34.200]  You made me laugh on text the other day when you were saying about
[03:34.200 --> 03:36.040]  how you need the whole
[03:36.040 --> 03:38.160]  wine thing. Yeah, the conversation
[03:38.160 --> 03:40.240]  we referenced. Yeah, put in a glass only
[03:40.240 --> 03:42.000]  they make. I gave you four ha's for that.
[03:42.560 --> 03:44.000]  And then you said you were going to take that
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.440]  momentum into the next day.
[03:45.940 --> 03:47.320]  Living that four ha lifestyle.
[03:47.780 --> 03:50.080]  I just want to know how you took that energy
[03:50.080 --> 03:52.200]  into the following day. I think it was a good day.
[03:52.460 --> 03:53.260]  What day was it? Yesterday?
[03:54.020 --> 03:55.160]  Is that yesterday or two days ago?
[03:56.680 --> 03:58.060]  Listen, I don't know. It's tough for me
[03:58.060 --> 04:00.080]  to track time. I've been sick, Gavin, and the spelling
[04:00.080 --> 04:02.040]  bee is on, so my priorities have been
[04:02.480 --> 04:03.820]  shifted. I'm scouting kids.
[04:03.960 --> 04:06.100]  I'm looking at words. Hearing bells
[04:06.100 --> 04:06.460]  ring.
[04:08.380 --> 04:10.040]  It's a whole thing. Please clip
[04:10.040 --> 04:12.300]  that. Our out of context stuff
[04:12.300 --> 04:13.920]  is going apeshit at the moment.
[04:14.040 --> 04:15.980]  Yeah, what did I say that was out of context?
[04:16.080 --> 04:17.480]  What could have been bad in that statement?
[04:17.480 --> 04:18.500]  Scouting kids?
[04:18.940 --> 04:21.540]  Scouting kids? I feel like you hear
[04:21.540 --> 04:23.400]  that in sports all the time.
[04:23.440 --> 04:25.380]  I think last episode I said eat a kid or something
[04:25.380 --> 04:27.480]  or eat a baby, like talking about
[04:27.480 --> 04:28.240]  Colin the Caterpillar.
[04:29.300 --> 04:30.440]  Eat a child or something.
[04:30.900 --> 04:33.120]  I don't remember that at all. I do, I do.
[04:33.280 --> 04:35.220]  We were talking about Colin's little babies.
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.700]  Oh, yeah, the little ones. Yeah, they sucked.
[04:39.380 --> 04:41.000]  They looked terrible. You don't know that they sucked?
[04:42.700 --> 04:43.500]  I said...
[04:43.500 --> 04:44.440]  They looked terrible.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.440]  What's looks terrible about it?
[04:46.440 --> 04:48.420]  I don't understand. You were with me that
[04:48.420 --> 04:50.380]  they were weird. The tiny little ones are weird.
[04:50.780 --> 04:52.520]  They're still the same cake though.
[04:52.920 --> 04:54.620]  Damn. Oh, now you're fucking all about
[04:54.620 --> 04:55.700]  Colin and his kids.
[04:56.420 --> 04:57.580]  That's a quick shift.
[04:59.020 --> 05:00.640]  You're with me. You know, we're all out of sync
[05:00.640 --> 05:02.060]  just right. We need to play video games.
[05:02.380 --> 05:04.220]  Alright, I thought you were with me on Colin and the kids.
[05:04.780 --> 05:06.300]  Please play video games, you two.
[05:06.760 --> 05:08.160]  Did you see, by the way, that we
[05:08.800 --> 05:10.520]  caused Al Pacino to have a baby?
[05:10.900 --> 05:11.520]  Oh, no.
[05:11.520 --> 05:13.020]  I want to be blamed for that.
[05:13.380 --> 05:14.660]  We did, we did.
[05:15.300 --> 05:17.400]  Oh, man.
[05:17.640 --> 05:18.680]  Who saw that coming?
[05:18.800 --> 05:21.120]  83, I think? Oh my god.
[05:22.160 --> 05:22.860]  He's gonna be
[05:24.360 --> 05:25.520]  101 at his
[05:25.520 --> 05:26.760]  kid's high school graduation.
[05:28.320 --> 05:29.680]  He made a movie
[05:29.680 --> 05:31.380]  40 years ago where he said he was
[05:31.380 --> 05:32.440]  too old to play football.
[05:33.080 --> 05:34.600]  And he's making people.
[05:35.120 --> 05:36.540]  He's making people today.
[05:36.840 --> 05:38.900]  And the person having his kid was born in like
[05:39.840 --> 05:41.060]  1994 or something?
[05:41.720 --> 05:42.240]  No.
[05:42.800 --> 05:44.840]  They're my age? Well, I think so.
[05:45.320 --> 05:46.240]  Oh, man.
[05:47.060 --> 05:48.900]  No. Doesn't
[05:48.900 --> 05:50.460]  seem fair that there's like
[05:50.460 --> 05:52.740]  a life cycle to the uterus
[05:52.740 --> 05:54.960]  but the penis just gets to keep
[05:54.960 --> 05:56.860]  on making babies forever.
[05:57.360 --> 05:59.080]  Yeah, well, it's the bulls mainly, I think.
[05:59.220 --> 06:00.660]  Yeah, well, they gotta go through the penis.
[06:02.300 --> 06:02.500]  You know,
[06:03.700 --> 06:04.220]  I...
[06:04.220 --> 06:06.980]  Do you think that this was
[06:06.980 --> 06:09.100]  a response to the De Niro thing? Because I feel like
[06:09.100 --> 06:10.940]  they get compared a lot and like he
[06:10.940 --> 06:12.620]  felt like he needed to establish.
[06:12.800 --> 06:15.060]  Yeah, I think it was a direct rebuttal.
[06:15.160 --> 06:15.440]  It was a direct counter.
[06:16.440 --> 06:17.320]  I'll show you.
[06:21.240 --> 06:23.000]  Just two kids who are 15
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.080]  when their dads are dead. Hanging out.
[06:25.220 --> 06:27.360]  Oh my god.
[06:27.840 --> 06:28.260]  Jesus.
[06:29.180 --> 06:30.800]  What? De Niro
[06:30.800 --> 06:33.020]  and Pacino aren't gonna be around for 15 more years?
[06:34.380 --> 06:34.820]  He's...
[06:34.820 --> 06:36.080]  Jesus Christ.
[06:36.600 --> 06:38.820]  He's old enough to be somebody's
[06:38.820 --> 06:39.820]  great-grandfather.
[06:40.480 --> 06:40.900]  Absolutely.
[06:41.800 --> 06:44.700]  They're old enough that if it said died of natural causes
[06:44.700 --> 06:45.620]  you would not be alarmed.
[06:45.840 --> 06:48.000]  That's a good point. They're in that range.
[06:48.140 --> 06:49.360]  He's natural causes age.
[06:50.420 --> 06:51.680]  Oh my god.
[06:52.360 --> 06:54.280]  I think he's having a kid with someone who
[06:54.280 --> 06:56.380]  was born after friends died.
[06:57.900 --> 06:58.180]  Ugh.
[07:01.220 --> 07:02.500]  Oh no.
[07:02.500 --> 07:02.660]  Oh.
[07:04.060 --> 07:05.120]  Was it on purpose?
[07:06.540 --> 07:07.940]  Was it at least an accident?
[07:09.640 --> 07:10.440]  Which is better
[07:10.440 --> 07:11.880]  to you, just out of curiosity?
[07:12.440 --> 07:13.860]  Accident. By far.
[07:14.220 --> 07:15.320]  Accident. Not intent.
[07:16.080 --> 07:18.400]  If Al Pacino was just like, I didn't know I had it
[07:18.400 --> 07:20.280]  in me either, then I would be like, okay
[07:20.280 --> 07:22.020]  that's not great, but like
[07:22.020 --> 07:24.360]  at least you weren't trying for a kid.
[07:25.020 --> 07:26.500]  Can you imagine...
[07:26.500 --> 07:26.800]  Ugh.
[07:28.160 --> 07:30.700]  Can you imagine wanting to have sex in your 80s?
[07:31.700 --> 07:32.620]  I really don't think
[07:32.620 --> 07:33.260]  I'll be there.
[07:34.360 --> 07:36.260]  Yeah? You'll think you've just done it.
[07:37.220 --> 07:38.680]  I mean, most people in their
[07:38.680 --> 07:40.600]  80s, they're not in great
[07:40.600 --> 07:42.620]  shape. I don't know that I'll
[07:42.620 --> 07:44.640]  be in the best of shape in my 80s.
[07:44.740 --> 07:46.680]  And sex is a lot of... I mean, I enjoy it. It's great.
[07:46.740 --> 07:47.640]  But it's a lot of work.
[07:48.480 --> 07:50.200]  And I just don't know that I'll
[07:50.200 --> 07:52.520]  want to be bothered with it
[07:52.520 --> 07:54.500]  in my 80s. Just seems like
[07:54.500 --> 07:56.480]  one of those things where you're like, at some point you quit
[07:56.480 --> 07:58.460]  cutting the grass. At some point
[07:59.320 --> 07:59.820]  You know?
[08:00.200 --> 08:01.920]  You're like, I'm too old to do that shit anymore.
[08:02.280 --> 08:04.380]  At some point I'm not gonna hit any more
[08:04.380 --> 08:06.380]  baseballs. I'm gonna go, you know what, I've hit enough baseballs
[08:06.380 --> 08:08.440]  in my life. I just, I feel like sex
[08:08.440 --> 08:10.540]  would follow. Would you like an alarm
[08:10.540 --> 08:12.380]  that goes off to signify the last time
[08:12.380 --> 08:13.880]  you do something? Yes.
[08:14.460 --> 08:15.160]  I think it would be
[08:17.140 --> 08:18.380]  heartbreaking and terrifying
[08:18.380 --> 08:20.300]  because it'd be like, you brush your teeth and the alarm
[08:20.300 --> 08:21.800]  goes off and you're like, wait a minute. Uh oh.
[08:22.300 --> 08:22.940]  Oh no.
[08:24.360 --> 08:26.420]  Yeah, it'd be a lot nicer on stuff that you rarely do.
[08:27.020 --> 08:27.840]  Like, uh
[08:28.420 --> 08:30.420]  I feel like there's definitely some games that I
[08:30.420 --> 08:32.000]  didn't assume I was gonna stop playing
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.360]  that I put down and I will literally never
[08:34.360 --> 08:36.140]  pick up again. Yeah, Fallout 3.
[08:37.540 --> 08:38.880]  You blame me for that.
[08:39.100 --> 08:39.720]  I do.
[08:41.160 --> 08:42.420]  Wait, who stopped
[08:42.420 --> 08:44.080]  what's this Fallout situation?
[08:44.280 --> 08:46.420]  I came to stay with Geoff for a few months and we
[08:46.420 --> 08:48.020]  started playing games together.
[08:48.340 --> 08:50.400]  Court games. Okay. But Geoff
[08:50.400 --> 08:51.480]  was in the middle of playing Fallout 3.
[08:51.940 --> 08:54.440]  And he kept saying, I can't wait for you to go home so I can
[08:54.440 --> 08:56.460]  keep, so I can carry on playing Fallout 3.
[08:56.860 --> 08:58.540]  And I went home and he still has
[08:58.540 --> 08:59.720]  never, I think it's been
[09:00.960 --> 09:02.560]  15 years and you still haven't picked it up?
[09:02.900 --> 09:04.360]  We were all gears of war
[09:04.360 --> 09:05.620]  that whole trip, I feel like. Yeah.
[09:05.900 --> 09:08.320]  We played a shitload of gears co-op. And then you
[09:08.320 --> 09:10.200]  left and I picked up Fallout 3 and I went,
[09:10.320 --> 09:11.560]  how the fuck does this work?
[09:12.340 --> 09:14.000]  It was too late.
[09:14.520 --> 09:16.340]  It's a rough game to put down for three months.
[09:16.660 --> 09:17.560]  Yeah, it really is.
[09:18.200 --> 09:18.920]  Three months?
[09:19.700 --> 09:21.060]  I stayed for a long time when I visited.
[09:21.060 --> 09:22.600]  Yeah, no, that makes sense.
[09:22.700 --> 09:24.620]  I just didn't, in my head it was like two weeks
[09:24.620 --> 09:25.800]  was how I imagined it.
[09:27.500 --> 09:29.040]  That's dead. You killed Fallout
[09:29.040 --> 09:30.520]  for him. Summer of 07.
[09:30.860 --> 09:33.000]  Yeah, when Gavin would come, he would stay for as long as
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.200]  possible. We would get as much
[09:35.200 --> 09:36.400]  out of our hangout time as we could.
[09:36.940 --> 09:38.600]  What's messed up is the summer of 07
[09:38.600 --> 09:40.920]  is, uh, what, nine
[09:40.920 --> 09:42.160]  years after the summer of 98?
[09:42.660 --> 09:44.200]  God, how's the summer of 98 doing?
[09:44.480 --> 09:46.980]  Are you guys living your 98 lifestyles?
[09:47.660 --> 09:48.620]  I mean, the weather's good.
[09:48.620 --> 09:49.960]  Weather is good.
[09:50.260 --> 09:52.740]  Yeah, the Al Pacino thing is really throwing me
[09:52.740 --> 09:54.580]  for a loop. I'm just thinking she was
[09:54.580 --> 09:56.400]  four. Summer of 98.
[09:56.540 --> 09:56.900]  Ugh.
[09:58.520 --> 09:58.980]  Yeah.
[10:00.560 --> 10:02.440]  That's not great. 98,
[10:02.580 --> 10:04.500]  that's how old Al Pacino's gonna be when he has his next
[10:04.500 --> 10:05.800]  kid. Oh no.
[10:08.000 --> 10:08.540]  These are
[10:08.540 --> 10:09.880]  certainly done, right?
[10:11.360 --> 10:12.760]  I mean, he can't do it
[10:12.760 --> 10:14.100]  again. How
[10:14.820 --> 10:16.440]  many kids does Al Pacino have?
[10:16.440 --> 10:18.200]  How could you say that
[10:18.200 --> 10:20.260]  they're certainly done? If I told you
[10:20.260 --> 10:22.340]  10 years ago that he was having a kid, you would
[10:22.340 --> 10:23.600]  say, oh, he's certainly done.
[10:24.040 --> 10:26.440]  To keep going. The sky's the
[10:26.440 --> 10:28.360]  limit. When Al Pacino got the news,
[10:28.420 --> 10:30.380]  he was like, every time I'm out,
[10:30.820 --> 10:32.100]  they pull me back in!
[10:32.540 --> 10:34.380]  Oh my god. Is that
[10:34.380 --> 10:36.520]  what this show is? What's happening?
[10:36.820 --> 10:38.440]  I don't know. They pull me back in?
[10:38.580 --> 10:39.900]  It sounds like it needs to be pull it out.
[10:40.460 --> 10:40.820]  Oh!
[10:43.360 --> 10:44.540]  Was that Errol or was
[10:44.540 --> 10:45.820]  that Gavin? That was Errol.
[10:48.360 --> 10:50.520]  He said that line, and I said, that guy
[10:50.520 --> 10:52.440]  sounds like he likes fruitcake or something.
[10:52.680 --> 10:54.660]  Or whatever other flavor
[10:54.660 --> 10:56.000]  you prefer but don't like.
[10:56.780 --> 10:58.640]  Uh, no, that was Wipton. Why didn't you get it
[10:58.640 --> 11:00.320]  right? Wipton? Well, he likes strawberries.
[11:01.600 --> 11:02.480]  He likes strawberries
[11:02.480 --> 11:04.160]  specifically. Wipton likes a strawberry jelly
[11:05.020 --> 11:05.420]  filling.
[11:06.480 --> 11:08.600]  What do you guys want to talk about this episode?
[11:08.900 --> 11:10.600]  I had a sad realization
[11:10.600 --> 11:12.460]  that wasn't that Al Pacino's
[11:12.460 --> 11:13.560]  time with kids. Okay.
[11:14.260 --> 11:16.420]  I had a second one. I no longer
[11:16.420 --> 11:18.520]  can claim that I have the greatest accomplishment
[11:18.520 --> 11:20.480]  from anyone that lives in Nanaima.
[11:21.020 --> 11:22.720]  It's dead. Oh, no.
[11:22.840 --> 11:24.580]  That dream is dead. That legacy
[11:24.580 --> 11:26.400]  is over. I was on top of Garfield
[11:26.400 --> 11:27.900]  Mountain. I was proud.
[11:29.140 --> 11:30.580]  I was up there a while.
[11:31.220 --> 11:32.600]  I don't know if you guys saw this.
[11:33.640 --> 11:34.300]  There's a new
[11:34.300 --> 11:35.060]  Nanaima legend.
[11:37.040 --> 11:37.220]  Oh!
[11:38.620 --> 11:40.400]  A woman from Nanaima
[11:40.400 --> 11:41.760]  won the cheese race.
[11:42.280 --> 11:44.000]  Yeah, she got knocked out, right? She got
[11:44.000 --> 11:45.780]  knocked unconscious and won
[11:45.780 --> 11:48.020]  while unconscious. I thought you had to
[11:48.020 --> 11:49.620]  actually catch the cheese. That's phenomenal.
[11:49.880 --> 11:51.320]  You just have to be the first to the bottom.
[11:51.640 --> 11:53.200]  Yeah, I think you're just chasing the cheese.
[11:53.680 --> 11:55.760]  Yeah, well, I thought it was like whoever grabbed it
[11:55.760 --> 11:57.700]  got the cheese, but no, she just made it to the bottom
[11:58.120 --> 11:59.900]  unconscious. She went all the way to
[11:59.900 --> 12:01.680]  England to get
[12:01.680 --> 12:03.880]  knocked out chasing cheese? I love it.
[12:04.300 --> 12:06.080]  I don't think she planned on entering
[12:06.080 --> 12:08.120]  until, like, roughly around the time
[12:08.120 --> 12:10.160]  that was her gaining consciousness, being like
[12:10.160 --> 12:11.100]  what just happened?
[12:11.600 --> 12:14.180]  You wake up with a wheel
[12:14.180 --> 12:16.120]  of cheese and you're surrounded by people
[12:16.120 --> 12:17.840]  and they're going, you won, you won!
[12:19.400 --> 12:20.100]  Weren't you supposed
[12:20.100 --> 12:22.000]  to name the cheese at one point or something?
[12:22.640 --> 12:24.120]  Yeah, that was a thing in the past.
[12:24.800 --> 12:25.480]  What, did it happen?
[12:25.940 --> 12:27.980]  No, no, that never happened. I don't know
[12:27.980 --> 12:28.880]  if it was a real cheese race.
[12:29.840 --> 12:31.860]  I never tracked down the
[12:32.680 --> 12:33.720]  validity of the offer.
[12:33.720 --> 12:35.160]  What a weird thing to not follow up on.
[12:37.080 --> 12:38.280]  On whose part?
[12:38.380 --> 12:39.040]  Mine or theirs?
[12:39.520 --> 12:40.020]  On both.
[12:40.380 --> 12:42.460]  Yeah, I think that's the right answer.
[12:43.760 --> 12:44.400]  You're right.
[12:45.280 --> 12:45.880]  It is both.
[12:46.700 --> 12:48.720]  Is there a clip of her getting knocked out?
[12:48.920 --> 12:50.980]  There is, yeah, I don't...
[12:50.980 --> 12:52.900]  It was like on TikTok or something.
[12:53.700 --> 12:54.740]  Do you think it would make your forces?
[12:55.320 --> 12:56.960]  It's not a fun fall.
[12:57.200 --> 12:58.880]  It is like a momentum
[12:58.880 --> 13:01.080]  earth shattering...
[13:01.080 --> 13:03.160]  Oh, Nick says...
[13:03.160 --> 13:04.460]  Minute 5 into that clip?
[13:04.680 --> 13:06.180]  Minute 5? Okay.
[13:07.840 --> 13:08.020]  Oh!
[13:09.740 --> 13:10.240]  Oh!
[13:11.160 --> 13:12.520]  So she's going full speed
[13:13.130 --> 13:15.180]  and then her legs no longer
[13:15.180 --> 13:17.240]  could go that speed and her body kept going
[13:17.240 --> 13:19.280]  and her head smashed into
[13:19.280 --> 13:19.740]  the ground.
[13:21.020 --> 13:23.420]  Dude, that angle and that speed
[13:23.420 --> 13:25.000]  it's like she fell from like
[13:25.000 --> 13:25.760]  12 feet up.
[13:26.780 --> 13:29.140]  The bounce. She tucked well.
[13:29.460 --> 13:31.120]  She did. I think she said
[13:31.120 --> 13:31.900]  that was her goal.
[13:32.880 --> 13:34.680]  She wanted to tuck to not break anything.
[13:36.280 --> 13:37.400]  So that's been my sentence.
[13:37.580 --> 13:39.120]  I'm very happy for her but I can no longer
[13:39.120 --> 13:40.180]  claim to have the greatest option.
[13:42.640 --> 13:44.080]  How about this?
[13:44.420 --> 13:47.140]  You are the
[13:47.140 --> 13:49.000]  most successful, famous
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.940]  Nanaimoan who's never been
[13:50.940 --> 13:53.220]  knocked out in the service
[13:53.220 --> 13:54.680]  of the thing that made them famous.
[13:55.820 --> 13:57.360]  You've never lost consciousness.
[13:58.660 --> 13:59.440]  Are you
[13:59.440 --> 14:01.400]  worried that it looked like she
[14:01.400 --> 14:03.460]  landed on her face but she didn't break her nose
[14:03.460 --> 14:04.620]  and now that's...
[14:06.320 --> 14:07.460]  I think if you were
[14:07.460 --> 14:09.100]  to ask her, because I did consider this.
[14:09.280 --> 14:11.400]  You know, I don't think she'd
[14:11.400 --> 14:12.560]  say she has an unbreakable nose.
[14:13.400 --> 14:15.480]  That was also a grass. There's a lot of grass
[14:15.480 --> 14:17.000]  in that field. There's a lot of cushion.
[14:18.280 --> 14:19.420]  Well, why didn't you
[14:19.420 --> 14:20.960]  treat this like a challenge and
[14:21.380 --> 14:23.360]  maybe go next year?
[14:23.820 --> 14:25.420]  I think if I fell down that
[14:25.420 --> 14:27.360]  hill, Gavin, I'd still
[14:27.360 --> 14:27.840]  be rolling.
[14:29.800 --> 14:30.920]  What do you mean?
[14:31.020 --> 14:33.160]  You'd just keep rolling and suddenly
[14:33.160 --> 14:35.380]  on the M4 you'd go all the way
[14:35.380 --> 14:37.520]  back to Canada? I would turn into
[14:37.520 --> 14:39.300]  a fucking Decepticon or whatever
[14:39.300 --> 14:40.500]  that you kept mentioning before.
[14:41.780 --> 14:43.720]  Yeah, I would become...
[14:46.890 --> 14:48.970]  I think the roll would start, it would never
[14:48.970 --> 14:50.790]  stop. It would be like
[14:50.790 --> 14:53.090]  unstoppable. They would have to try to come up with
[14:53.090 --> 14:54.730]  a way to stop my momentum.
[14:54.730 --> 14:59.410]  I would love you to meet this person
[14:59.410 --> 15:01.290]  and maybe do our first
[15:01.290 --> 15:03.510]  face interview. Maybe ask her
[15:03.510 --> 15:04.370]  how it felt.
[15:12.440 --> 15:13.120]  What?
[15:16.600 --> 15:18.620]  What's wrong with her?
[15:24.170 --> 15:25.710]  She's got information
[15:25.710 --> 15:26.330]  that we don't.
[15:34.410 --> 15:37.230]  You could ask her hard-hitting questions like
[15:37.230 --> 15:39.210]  my friend Gavin, he got
[15:39.210 --> 15:41.450]  knocked out once when he was a little boy and he went blind
[15:41.450 --> 15:43.290]  for two days. How did you not go blind
[15:43.290 --> 15:43.950]  for two days?
[15:47.410 --> 15:49.670]  That's the worst question I've ever heard!
[15:50.390 --> 15:51.430]  That's the reason I'm not
[15:51.430 --> 15:53.390]  an interviewer. Is that really what you
[15:53.390 --> 15:55.330]  want to know? Do you genuinely
[15:55.330 --> 15:56.670]  want to know how does it feel?
[16:03.890 --> 16:04.790]  That was like
[16:06.050 --> 16:07.810]  Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld used to
[16:07.810 --> 16:09.010]  interview on the Howard Stern show all the time.
[16:09.150 --> 16:11.670]  When the Seinfeld show happened and he got famous, he did not
[16:11.670 --> 16:13.610]  need to anymore. He wasn't on for
[16:13.610 --> 16:15.790]  25 years and finally he came back
[16:15.790 --> 16:17.490]  on. The first question
[16:17.490 --> 16:19.010]  Howard asked him after the introduction
[16:19.010 --> 16:19.450]  was,
[16:22.310 --> 16:23.670]  where do your ideas
[16:23.670 --> 16:24.970]  come from? Seinfeld goes,
[16:25.270 --> 16:27.070]  really? After 25 years?
[16:27.190 --> 16:28.770]  Is that where we are with this?
[16:29.130 --> 16:31.570]  Where do my ideas come from? That's the best question
[16:31.570 --> 16:33.710]  you could come up with to ask me
[16:33.710 --> 16:35.450]  out the gate. It was so
[16:36.630 --> 16:37.070]  emasculating.
[16:40.250 --> 16:41.130]  Oh man.
[16:41.490 --> 16:43.510]  We saw him live once. Yeah, that was a great
[16:43.510 --> 16:45.450]  time. That was a lot of fun. I think that was the saddest
[16:45.450 --> 16:47.530]  I've ever seen you there. I was pretty sad.
[16:48.210 --> 16:49.410]  It was a really funny
[16:49.410 --> 16:49.770]  set.
[16:51.350 --> 16:52.110]  Calm down.
[16:56.710 --> 16:59.470]  We were laughing our asses off at Seinfeld.
[16:59.890 --> 17:01.270]  We were surprised at how clean
[17:01.270 --> 17:02.390]  his act was.
[17:02.390 --> 17:04.090]  Well, I was at least.
[17:05.130 --> 17:05.730]  And then
[17:06.910 --> 17:08.390]  as we were walking out, Geoff
[17:08.390 --> 17:10.370]  was like, I think I'm going to pack it all in.
[17:10.470 --> 17:12.270]  I think I'm going to quit. I'll never be as funny as him.
[17:12.310 --> 17:14.210]  And you just got into a weird spiral
[17:14.210 --> 17:16.410]  of depression based on how funny
[17:16.830 --> 17:17.970]  Jerry Seinfeld was.
[17:18.330 --> 17:20.210]  I was drinking a lot
[17:20.210 --> 17:21.230]  back then.
[17:21.470 --> 17:23.270]  I was pretty drunk, I think.
[17:24.490 --> 17:26.370]  There was something that used to really
[17:26.370 --> 17:28.510]  bum me out when I'd see people do something
[17:28.510 --> 17:30.410]  better than I'd ever be able to do it.
[17:30.410 --> 17:32.310]  And just be like, oh, I'm not that.
[17:32.730 --> 17:33.630]  It used to really
[17:34.350 --> 17:36.450]  affect me, I guess. Like someone who can get knocked out
[17:36.450 --> 17:37.750]  and win a race? Yeah.
[17:38.050 --> 17:40.270]  If I get knocked out, I'm losing the race. Guarantee you.
[17:40.650 --> 17:42.350]  If you get knocked out, can you
[17:42.350 --> 17:43.130]  tell us how it feels?
[17:45.170 --> 17:46.410]  Only if somebody asked me
[17:46.410 --> 17:48.390]  in an interview. Alright, Andrew, what would
[17:48.390 --> 17:48.910]  you ask?
[17:50.650 --> 17:55.590]  I'm thinking about it, but I don't think
[17:55.590 --> 17:56.670]  how does it feel?
[17:58.770 --> 17:59.770]  Here's what we do.
[17:59.850 --> 18:00.790]  You prepare a question.
[18:01.410 --> 18:02.670]  You'll meet up with her in Nanaimo.
[18:03.230 --> 18:04.870]  And then you ask
[18:04.870 --> 18:06.650]  her your question and then you ask her my question
[18:06.650 --> 18:07.870]  and see which has a better response.
[18:08.270 --> 18:10.810]  No, I think I just lead with your question. We see how it
[18:10.810 --> 18:11.150]  goes.
[18:12.830 --> 18:14.710]  How about this? You do the
[18:14.710 --> 18:16.650]  interview, but you only ask her Gavin's
[18:16.650 --> 18:18.390]  question and then you go, okay, thank you for your time.
[18:18.870 --> 18:18.990]  Yeah.
[18:21.090 --> 18:21.850]  Oh, man.
[18:23.450 --> 18:24.690]  Can I change
[18:24.690 --> 18:25.970]  the subject a little bit? Of course.
[18:27.630 --> 18:28.930]  I'm trying to think ahead
[18:28.930 --> 18:30.550]  on F*** Face
[18:30.550 --> 18:32.470]  because I have time and
[18:32.470 --> 18:35.030]  Beanhole Days is
[18:35.030 --> 18:36.310]  a very real thing.
[18:36.790 --> 18:39.330]  It is the middle of July.
[18:41.250 --> 18:43.030]  Is this something we're considering
[18:43.030 --> 18:44.950]  still so I know what we're
[18:44.950 --> 18:45.610]  doing exactly?
[18:46.670 --> 18:48.790]  I need to look at it. I also
[18:48.790 --> 18:51.110]  really want to go to the Hobo
[18:51.950 --> 18:52.950]  convention this
[18:52.950 --> 18:54.170]  year as well.
[18:55.470 --> 18:57.310]  There's like a
[18:57.310 --> 18:59.210]  Hobo festival where they crown
[18:59.210 --> 19:01.490]  the new king and queen of the Hobos
[19:01.490 --> 19:03.310]  every year and it's a whole thing.
[19:03.370 --> 19:05.290]  I think it's around the same time as Beanhole Days
[19:05.290 --> 19:07.330]  and I really... I've been a
[19:07.330 --> 19:08.610]  fan of Hobos longer than Beans.
[19:09.190 --> 19:10.870]  I'm going to try to work both out.
[19:11.310 --> 19:12.750]  Here's what I will say.
[19:13.310 --> 19:15.250]  This show has not been
[19:15.250 --> 19:17.250]  notoriously a Hobo podcast.
[19:17.830 --> 19:18.150]  No.
[19:19.110 --> 19:20.410]  No, that's more of a me thing.
[19:20.810 --> 19:22.850]  What do you mean you're into Hobos?
[19:23.050 --> 19:24.290]  Thank you, Gavin.
[19:25.350 --> 19:26.470]  I'm into Hobos.
[19:26.890 --> 19:28.310]  I like the idea
[19:28.310 --> 19:30.170]  of the
[19:30.850 --> 19:31.810]  Hobo lifestyle.
[19:32.590 --> 19:34.610]  I'm reading a book about the history of Hobos
[19:34.610 --> 19:36.190]  right now. I got Hobo tattoos.
[19:37.390 --> 19:37.590]  I...
[19:38.350 --> 19:40.110]  I don't know. I like
[19:40.110 --> 19:42.550]  the idea of riding... I don't want to do it.
[19:42.590 --> 19:44.310]  I've never wanted to do it, but I just think it was
[19:44.310 --> 19:46.270]  an interesting lifestyle to ride the rail
[19:46.270 --> 19:47.710]  from town to town and
[19:48.290 --> 19:49.310]  try to figure out
[19:51.430 --> 19:52.390]  what towns
[19:52.390 --> 19:54.070]  were friendly and what weren't and how to get
[19:54.770 --> 19:55.530]  farm work.
[19:56.030 --> 19:58.330]  It was an interesting time in America.
[19:58.810 --> 20:00.630]  The industrialization of agriculture
[20:00.630 --> 20:02.310]  and it was
[20:02.310 --> 20:04.390]  an interesting touch point in history and I think it's
[20:04.390 --> 20:06.390]  kind of fascinating. That was such a
[20:06.390 --> 20:07.530]  valid response to that question.
[20:08.210 --> 20:08.590]  Right.
[20:10.290 --> 20:11.890]  I'm cool. I'm like, great, man.
[20:12.030 --> 20:13.850]  I'm glad you have a real answer for that.
[20:13.990 --> 20:15.890]  So are we doing the beans or what's going on?
[20:15.890 --> 20:18.570]  I don't think we can go to bean fest until we successfully
[20:18.570 --> 20:20.410]  have a bean hole. I think they've got to do
[20:20.410 --> 20:22.190]  a bean hole too before we can show up
[20:22.190 --> 20:23.810]  to bean hole fest. What are bean hole days?
[20:24.330 --> 20:26.130]  Bean hole days this year
[20:26.610 --> 20:28.290]  Tuesday, July 18th and
[20:28.290 --> 20:29.910]  Wednesday, July 19th.
[20:30.010 --> 20:31.930]  Then I can do it. Yeah, I think we go.
[20:32.130 --> 20:34.210]  We don't necessarily have to try our hand
[20:34.210 --> 20:36.330]  at beaning. Maybe that's our learning
[20:36.330 --> 20:38.390]  trip to learn from the experts.
[20:38.710 --> 20:39.830]  We can get a lot of tips.
[20:40.130 --> 20:41.910]  We'll take notes. I'm now on board.
[20:41.970 --> 20:43.990]  If you guys scout bean hole fest
[20:43.990 --> 20:46.150]  and then come back and then do the bean hole thing
[20:46.150 --> 20:48.190]  with what you've learned, that I support.
[20:48.850 --> 20:50.110]  I'm just trying to figure
[20:50.110 --> 20:52.150]  out budget wise what it's going to be for us
[20:52.150 --> 20:54.190]  to fly there. I'll send you
[20:54.190 --> 20:55.950]  this link here
[20:55.950 --> 20:58.130]  where we have
[20:58.130 --> 21:00.110]  sort of an abundance of things
[21:00.110 --> 21:01.850]  that we can do. I mean, not
[21:01.850 --> 21:04.030]  activities because it does not seem like there is much.
[21:04.410 --> 21:05.830]  But there's a t-shirt.
[21:06.250 --> 21:08.450]  There's a vintage t-shirt. There's
[21:08.450 --> 21:10.250]  a beans to go container.
[21:11.110 --> 21:12.210]  There's a package.
[21:12.370 --> 21:14.110]  There's a beans cost, but there's
[21:14.110 --> 21:16.230]  also a beans and mug cost.
[21:16.230 --> 21:18.190]  Just kind of
[21:18.190 --> 21:20.210]  I don't want to get nickel and dimed
[21:20.210 --> 21:22.290]  by bean hole days, but I am
[21:22.290 --> 21:24.290]  trying to figure out if this is something
[21:24.290 --> 21:26.290]  we are going to do and what exactly
[21:26.290 --> 21:28.310]  that means. Burying the beans
[21:28.310 --> 21:29.670]  occurs on the 18th.
[21:30.110 --> 21:31.310]  They sell a
[21:31.310 --> 21:33.310]  t-shirt for $25.
[21:34.370 --> 21:36.110]  That seems fine. That seems fair.
[21:37.050 --> 21:38.250]  That's about running
[21:38.250 --> 21:40.230]  I'd say average for a t-shirt right now.
[21:40.610 --> 21:42.250]  They sell a vintage t-shirt
[21:42.250 --> 21:42.910]  for $20.
[21:42.910 --> 21:43.710]  Right.
[21:46.010 --> 21:46.990]  When you say
[21:46.990 --> 21:48.950]  vintage t-shirt, it's like a very
[21:48.950 --> 21:51.090]  expensive t-shirt where they printed an old
[21:51.090 --> 21:52.890]  Aerosmith logo on it and then sell it
[21:52.890 --> 21:54.810]  for a lot of money. But do you think in this
[21:54.810 --> 21:56.870]  instance, because it's $5 cheaper than the t-shirt,
[21:56.990 --> 21:58.830]  it's just last year's t-shirt? 100%.
[21:59.690 --> 22:00.090]  Absolutely.
[22:00.730 --> 22:01.370]  I like that.
[22:02.210 --> 22:05.030]  You can instantly look like you've been to 9 of those
[22:05.030 --> 22:06.930]  things. So again, if you
[22:06.930 --> 22:08.390]  look to the next one, mugs,
[22:08.830 --> 22:10.990]  15. Vintage mugs,
[22:10.990 --> 22:13.010]  10. Why is it
[22:13.010 --> 22:14.190]  only 10 hours long?
[22:15.450 --> 22:16.850]  I mean, how much...
[22:16.850 --> 22:18.050]  I mean, it's beans, Gavin.
[22:18.670 --> 22:19.910]  How much do you want?
[22:20.590 --> 22:22.090]  I just thought it'd last more than a day.
[22:23.010 --> 22:24.970]  Well, it starts on the 18th.
[22:25.010 --> 22:26.850]  Well, it starts at 5pm on the 18th and ends
[22:26.850 --> 22:28.950]  at 3am. I was just gonna say, I'm disappointed
[22:28.950 --> 22:30.690]  by the lack of beans. There's only
[22:30.690 --> 22:32.650]  5 cast iron kettles?
[22:33.270 --> 22:34.910]  Only 5 people making beans at
[22:34.910 --> 22:36.970]  Beanhole Fest? See, this is
[22:36.970 --> 22:38.970]  why I brought this up, because I'm
[22:38.970 --> 22:40.870]  worried about Beanhole Fest, if I'm being honest.
[22:40.890 --> 22:42.170]  I don't think...
[22:42.170 --> 22:44.670]  I'm gonna see what you're saying, Eric. I feel like
[22:44.670 --> 22:46.810]  our vision of what Beanhole Fest
[22:46.810 --> 22:48.890]  is can never compare to what the
[22:48.890 --> 22:50.850]  experience... and I don't want to be down on
[22:50.850 --> 22:52.950]  Beanhole. What if we all go
[22:52.950 --> 22:54.510]  and do an episode from there?
[22:55.350 --> 22:55.750]  Yes.
[22:56.650 --> 22:58.710]  I think that's a great idea as well. I think
[22:58.710 --> 23:00.350]  there's two things happening here. One,
[23:01.450 --> 23:02.850]  beans are breaking, but
[23:02.850 --> 23:04.950]  they haven't quite broke yet. So when we
[23:04.950 --> 23:06.850]  get into like a Beanhole days now, we're getting in
[23:06.850 --> 23:08.870]  at the ground floor. It's kind of like how
[23:08.870 --> 23:10.550]  the first year we went to Comic Con
[23:10.550 --> 23:12.970]  was the last year you could just get
[23:12.970 --> 23:14.550]  in and get a booth at Comic Con.
[23:14.950 --> 23:16.730]  And then our booth suddenly became worth like
[23:16.730 --> 23:18.730]  10 times what we were paying for it
[23:18.730 --> 23:20.090]  from that point on.
[23:20.430 --> 23:22.390]  We're at that inflection point
[23:22.390 --> 23:24.290]  of Beanhole Days. Yeah, but we haven't...
[23:24.710 --> 23:26.850]  And it's working. Slowly.
[23:27.090 --> 23:28.890]  But this only happens once a year, right?
[23:29.170 --> 23:30.630]  We gotta go. We gotta
[23:30.630 --> 23:32.830]  prove it out. When we go to Beanhole Day
[23:32.830 --> 23:34.390]  and we show the larger
[23:34.390 --> 23:36.110]  F*** Face community and then the world.
[23:36.410 --> 23:38.350]  Because remember, a lot of people listen
[23:38.350 --> 23:40.270]  to F*** Face. 7.5 billion
[23:40.270 --> 23:42.510]  people on Earth. That's a lot of people that don't
[23:42.510 --> 23:43.890]  listen to F*** Face yet that we need
[23:43.890 --> 23:46.390]  to identify. I think we're over 8 billion
[23:46.390 --> 23:48.310]  now. 8 billion. We gotta f***. There's another
[23:48.310 --> 23:50.370]  half a billion people
[23:50.370 --> 23:51.650]  we gotta f***ing engage with.
[23:52.730 --> 23:54.330]  It's gonna start growing and then
[23:54.330 --> 23:55.690]  it's gonna go like crazy. Also,
[23:56.090 --> 23:58.230]  here's the thing. We're gonna go all the way up there
[23:58.230 --> 23:59.970]  for Beanhole Days. Gavin's bitching
[23:59.970 --> 24:02.090]  because it's not a five day festival.
[24:02.090 --> 24:04.350]  Listen, man. You're gonna wanna get in there.
[24:04.570 --> 24:06.170]  You're gonna wanna do it for five hours
[24:06.170 --> 24:08.530]  and then you wanna get the f*** out of there and go back to Austin.
[24:08.550 --> 24:10.110]  No, it's perfect. I'm saying it's
[24:10.110 --> 24:12.190]  not really Beanhole Days if it's
[24:12.190 --> 24:14.150]  a ten hour event. Well, it starts
[24:14.150 --> 24:16.270]  on the day before, right? It starts on
[24:16.270 --> 24:18.270]  the 5.30pm
[24:18.270 --> 24:20.130]  on the 18th. Yeah, but if we started
[24:20.130 --> 24:22.150]  Sloppy Joes at 11.30pm and wrapped up
[24:22.150 --> 24:23.570]  one, I wouldn't call it Sloppy Days.
[24:23.870 --> 24:26.170]  And then the next day starts at 9am
[24:26.630 --> 24:27.930]  and goes until
[24:27.930 --> 24:29.670]  2pm. Wait, what?
[24:29.670 --> 24:31.710]  You just gotta scroll down a little bit
[24:31.710 --> 24:33.690]  and it says Tuesday the
[24:33.690 --> 24:35.550]  18th, 5.30pm, Burying the Beans.
[24:35.930 --> 24:37.670]  And then you go to Wednesday the 19th
[24:38.550 --> 24:39.690]  Oh, I was just looking at
[24:39.690 --> 24:41.310]  the top header where it's a lie.
[24:41.710 --> 24:43.930]  Right. It also
[24:43.930 --> 24:45.750]  says 5.30pm
[24:45.750 --> 24:47.850]  Burying the Beans at South Trailside
[24:47.850 --> 24:49.910]  Park. Watch as the pit crew lowers
[24:49.910 --> 24:51.450]  the five cast iron
[24:51.450 --> 24:53.610]  kettles, which they may be f***ing huge. They may be
[24:53.610 --> 24:55.130]  the size of a, like a, of a
[24:55.520 --> 24:57.310]  like a Geo Metro. We don't know.
[24:57.310 --> 24:59.250]  So that they can cook overnight
[24:59.250 --> 25:01.410]  and be served to thousands
[25:01.410 --> 25:03.410]  the next day. There's gonna be
[25:03.410 --> 25:05.510]  thousands of bean fans
[25:05.510 --> 25:07.490]  the next day. It's gonna be
[25:07.490 --> 25:08.870]  you're gonna be amongst
[25:09.490 --> 25:11.170]  our people. It's gonna be
[25:11.170 --> 25:13.190]  a really warm, welcoming feeling.
[25:13.550 --> 25:14.290]  And we're gonna love it.
[25:14.670 --> 25:17.510]  This is gonna be the least my people I've ever
[25:17.510 --> 25:17.970]  been around.
[25:18.170 --> 25:21.070]  I am not gonna fit.
[25:22.530 --> 25:23.790]  We're a podcast with
[25:23.790 --> 25:25.290]  f*** in the title.
[25:25.290 --> 25:27.390]  No one here wants us there.
[25:31.910 --> 25:33.290]  And while we're there, we can
[25:33.290 --> 25:35.390]  petition the Chamber of Commerce
[25:35.390 --> 25:37.090]  at Brainerd Lakes to change it from
[25:37.090 --> 25:39.510]  Beanhole Days to Beanhole Day Plus.
[25:40.010 --> 25:40.450]  Yeah.
[25:41.990 --> 25:43.230]  I think we should go.
[25:43.590 --> 25:44.390]  I'm up for going.
[25:44.910 --> 25:47.050]  Okay. Okay. We can
[25:47.050 --> 25:49.350]  figure this all out. I just wanted to kinda get
[25:49.970 --> 25:51.410]  the feeling, like
[25:51.410 --> 25:52.650]  kinda like gut check here
[25:52.650 --> 25:54.710]  on what it was gonna be.
[25:54.890 --> 25:56.570]  So, it is the middle of the week, which is
[25:56.570 --> 25:57.470]  very weird.
[25:58.550 --> 26:00.470]  It's a Tuesday, Wednesday. Like, what?
[26:00.510 --> 26:02.570]  Yeah, but there's gonna be a trampoline
[26:02.570 --> 26:04.610]  jump, and kids bungee, and
[26:04.610 --> 26:05.850]  there's gonna be water wars.
[26:06.170 --> 26:08.510]  But are you ready for the crowning of the king and queen bean?
[26:08.910 --> 26:10.770]  I am. And then a couple weeks later
[26:10.770 --> 26:12.710]  I'm gonna go see the king and the queen hobo get crowned.
[26:13.750 --> 26:14.570]  Chris Olsen's gonna
[26:14.570 --> 26:16.690]  perform his Elvis tribute show.
[26:17.010 --> 26:18.590]  Oh, wow! The Chris Olsen and
[26:18.590 --> 26:19.530]  his Elvis tribute show?
[26:19.530 --> 26:21.790]  Yeah. I hope he gets enough time.
[26:22.030 --> 26:23.170]  That state borders Canada.
[26:25.770 --> 26:26.330]  Yeah.
[26:27.230 --> 26:27.790]  Yeah.
[26:33.220 --> 26:35.400]  That's a fact. How do you feel about that fact?
[26:35.800 --> 26:37.820]  I think it's a factual fact, but I think
[26:37.820 --> 26:38.960]  it's a good fact right there.
[26:39.440 --> 26:41.680]  Andrew, what if a plane
[26:41.680 --> 26:43.840]  ticket was to arrive in your
[26:43.840 --> 26:45.820]  inbox, all expenses paid
[26:45.820 --> 26:47.180]  for a trip to
[26:47.840 --> 26:49.880]  the states, but not Texas, not
[26:49.880 --> 26:51.840]  our state, a really north, close to
[26:51.840 --> 26:54.100]  Canada state, for just like a two day vacation?
[26:54.620 --> 26:55.980]  If it's legal,
[26:56.220 --> 26:58.020]  as long as everything is legal,
[26:58.160 --> 27:00.000]  as far as me being in the US
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.840]  not working, I'm not opposed.
[27:02.280 --> 27:03.800]  You're attending a bean
[27:03.800 --> 27:04.860]  festival. Yeah.
[27:05.940 --> 27:07.860]  We wouldn't record
[27:07.860 --> 27:10.000]  there or anything. We would record at an undisclosed
[27:10.000 --> 27:10.740]  location later.
[27:11.820 --> 27:13.680]  At a different time. We would hop
[27:13.680 --> 27:15.480]  across the border to
[27:16.360 --> 27:18.040]  Ontario. Oh, then I can't work.
[27:18.660 --> 27:19.820]  No, no, here's what we'll do.
[27:19.940 --> 27:20.520]  Here's what we'll do.
[27:22.880 --> 27:24.040]  Eric has this thing
[27:24.040 --> 27:25.920]  that we record with Anma, this like little
[27:25.920 --> 27:28.200]  portable recorder, right? Andrew will sit
[27:28.200 --> 27:30.120]  on the Canadian side, and we'll sit on the
[27:30.120 --> 27:31.680]  US side, and then put
[27:32.560 --> 27:33.820]  the recorder in the middle.
[27:34.800 --> 27:35.700]  Long XLR cables.
[27:36.380 --> 27:38.380]  Can you do a split border podcast?
[27:38.680 --> 27:39.820]  Is that legal? Yeah.
[27:40.140 --> 27:41.920]  Why would that be illegal? Yeah, that'd be fine
[27:41.920 --> 27:43.880]  as long as I'm in Canada.
[27:44.580 --> 27:46.040]  Or if I have...
[27:46.040 --> 27:47.820]  Yeah, that's perfect.
[27:48.040 --> 27:50.040]  I saw this place up north. I don't know
[27:50.040 --> 27:51.900]  if it was New York, or maybe it was like
[27:51.900 --> 27:53.040]  Michigan or somewhere, but
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.920]  there was like a park, and the
[27:55.920 --> 27:57.740]  park separated US and Canada.
[27:58.080 --> 28:00.080]  And so people would come and put their lawn chairs on one
[28:00.080 --> 28:02.080]  side of the park in Canada, and talk
[28:02.080 --> 28:03.940]  to their friends in America who were on lawn chairs
[28:03.940 --> 28:05.820]  on the other side. And there was just like a fucking rope
[28:05.820 --> 28:07.280]  between them, and it's like, you know,
[28:07.400 --> 28:09.920]  some lazy border guard walking around.
[28:10.280 --> 28:12.100]  But like, if we could find a spot
[28:12.100 --> 28:14.040]  like that, we could...
[28:14.040 --> 28:15.580]  Fuck, dude. We could grill.
[28:16.120 --> 28:18.020]  I will say the meanest border guy
[28:18.020 --> 28:19.760]  I've ever experienced was a Canadian one.
[28:20.400 --> 28:20.680]  Okay.
[28:21.580 --> 28:23.620]  I don't know, you know, I don't like to make
[28:24.180 --> 28:26.200]  rash judgments based on one experience
[28:26.200 --> 28:27.880]  with a group. I would
[28:27.880 --> 28:29.940]  leave that up to you had a bad interaction with
[28:29.940 --> 28:32.020]  a Canadian border guy. I wouldn't say all Canadian border
[28:32.020 --> 28:34.000]  guys are bad. Well, he didn't
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.060]  say it was the only bad interaction he had
[28:36.060 --> 28:37.740]  with a Canadian border guy, he just said it was the worst.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.180]  He might have a lot of bad ones. That's fair.
[28:40.180 --> 28:41.120]  That's a good point.
[28:42.520 --> 28:43.680]  You have a lot of bad ones?
[28:44.600 --> 28:46.240]  Yeah, I've had two
[28:46.240 --> 28:48.100]  bad ones, and one where the guy
[28:48.100 --> 28:50.100]  knew who I was and was like, get in here,
[28:50.120 --> 28:50.760]  you little rascal.
[28:52.680 --> 28:53.380]  That's great.
[28:53.960 --> 28:55.900]  Yeah. What about that?
[28:56.940 --> 28:57.640]  It's up in the air.
[28:58.560 --> 29:00.280]  Are you just saying specifically these are your
[29:00.280 --> 29:02.080]  interactions with Canada or travel
[29:02.080 --> 29:03.480]  in general? No, Canada.
[29:03.900 --> 29:06.000]  What about travel in general? No, it's fine,
[29:06.060 --> 29:08.080]  apart from... Really, you've only had
[29:08.080 --> 29:09.680]  a bad experience with a Canadian
[29:10.420 --> 29:12.080]  border guy? Yeah, well, obviously I'm the
[29:12.080 --> 29:13.500]  US, but now I've got
[29:13.900 --> 29:16.260]  all my documents, haven't I? Oh, that's nice.
[29:16.500 --> 29:18.160]  I've got a green card. That's great.
[29:18.220 --> 29:20.280]  So now no one talks to me anymore. As long
[29:20.280 --> 29:21.320]  as it's legal, I'm in.
[29:21.840 --> 29:24.080]  As long as there's no issue of me getting in
[29:24.080 --> 29:25.260]  trouble. I wish it
[29:25.960 --> 29:28.180]  worked like that. I wish I could buy a green
[29:28.180 --> 29:30.020]  card, and then if people tried to talk
[29:30.020 --> 29:32.060]  to me in public, I could just raise the card, and they'd
[29:32.060 --> 29:33.700]  go, oh, he's got a card he can't talk to.
[29:35.460 --> 29:36.020]  You could just
[29:36.020 --> 29:37.680]  use a get-out-of-conversations card.
[29:38.300 --> 29:40.040]  Yeah, I'm trying to
[29:40.040 --> 29:42.020]  think of what that could work
[29:42.020 --> 29:43.800]  out as. What would be
[29:43.800 --> 29:46.140]  a way to do that? I mean,
[29:46.600 --> 29:47.980]  I think you just, when someone
[29:47.980 --> 29:50.040]  talks to you, you just walk away.
[29:50.680 --> 29:52.060]  Oh, shit. I have a card that says
[29:52.420 --> 29:54.060]  I'll know, I'll reign over it here.
[29:54.260 --> 29:56.020]  You kind of just put a card into the
[29:56.020 --> 29:57.900]  situation, but I think you could just...
[29:57.900 --> 30:00.080]  No, I think the card is nice, because it stops the flow
[30:00.080 --> 30:02.100]  of the conversation, because they have to stop to look
[30:02.100 --> 30:04.060]  at it and read it for a second, and then you're already turned
[30:04.060 --> 30:06.220]  back and you're walking away. And the card just says
[30:06.220 --> 30:08.160]  I'll no longer be participating
[30:08.160 --> 30:09.260]  in this conversation.
[30:13.700 --> 30:14.740]  And it's green.
[30:16.140 --> 30:18.040]  That's the official color for people
[30:18.040 --> 30:19.620]  not talking to you anymore. I guess so.
[30:19.800 --> 30:21.220]  Yeah, green means stop.
[30:23.920 --> 30:26.180]  So, Andrew, you'll come down. We won't record
[30:26.180 --> 30:27.920]  or work or anything. We'll just be beanhole
[30:27.920 --> 30:29.960]  aficionados, and then we can do work
[30:29.960 --> 30:31.520]  stuff later, back when you're in Canada.
[30:31.520 --> 30:33.680]  Or we'll just get a really long XLR.
[30:34.400 --> 30:35.800]  I like the long XLR
[30:35.800 --> 30:37.380]  better. I trust that more.
[30:37.640 --> 30:39.680]  I do too. We should find a good spot
[30:39.680 --> 30:40.040]  on the border.
[30:41.680 --> 30:43.520]  Eric, can you find us a good spot on the border?
[30:43.580 --> 30:44.800]  I'm gonna look right now.
[30:45.220 --> 30:47.540]  Is there a place with a really long
[30:47.540 --> 30:49.560]  park bench? Yeah, what's the name
[30:49.560 --> 30:51.360]  of this city? Pequot or something?
[30:51.980 --> 30:52.840]  What is it? There's...
[30:53.400 --> 30:54.160]  Pequot Lakes?
[30:55.660 --> 30:56.740]  There are a few places like that.
[30:57.300 --> 30:59.280]  Really? Yeah, there's
[30:59.280 --> 31:00.880]  a place kind of close
[31:00.880 --> 31:02.220]  that has some
[31:04.000 --> 31:05.040]  unguarded border
[31:05.040 --> 31:07.200]  crossing areas that are
[31:07.200 --> 31:08.540]  like just streets.
[31:08.700 --> 31:09.980]  We're getting weird now.
[31:12.160 --> 31:13.200]  We're 159.
[31:13.260 --> 31:14.660]  We got weird a long time ago.
[31:15.140 --> 31:16.280]  We're not just getting weird.
[31:17.760 --> 31:19.200]  We got a guy that runs around
[31:19.200 --> 31:21.280]  with fucking groan tubes on his feet.
[31:21.520 --> 31:22.340]  We've been weird.
[31:22.980 --> 31:24.700]  This is not... Hang on.
[31:25.120 --> 31:27.280]  Wait a second. You guys were
[31:27.280 --> 31:29.500]  saying this is like close to the border?
[31:29.960 --> 31:31.380]  Gavin did. Take that with a
[31:31.380 --> 31:32.840]  grain of salt. Is that not a real fact?
[31:33.160 --> 31:35.060]  Because I supported him in that. I'll be hurt.
[31:35.700 --> 31:37.460]  I said the state borders Canada.
[31:37.860 --> 31:38.500]  Oh, okay.
[31:43.880 --> 31:44.560]  Take on
[31:44.560 --> 31:46.420]  the sun with gear built to last.

[33:12.000 --> 33:13.740]  Using the Internet without ExpressVPN
[33:13.740 --> 33:15.620]  is like passing a note in class and having the teacher
[33:15.620 --> 33:17.640]  read it aloud to everyone. Nobody
[33:17.640 --> 33:20.060]  else has to know about your secret crush on Stacy's
[33:20.060 --> 33:21.580]  mom. Why does everyone
[33:21.580 --> 33:23.540]  need a VPN? Internet service
[33:23.540 --> 33:25.440]  providers know every single website
[33:25.440 --> 33:27.640]  you visit. Nobody wants that. Not that
[33:27.640 --> 33:29.860]  I'm looking at crazy stuff, but like a little privacy
[33:29.860 --> 33:31.600]  is nice. ISPs
[33:31.600 --> 33:33.560]  can sell this information to ad companies and
[33:33.560 --> 33:35.740]  tech giants who then use your data
[33:35.740 --> 33:37.600]  to target you. I don't want to be targeted for
[33:37.600 --> 33:39.540]  anything. I'm not a big fan of targeting.
[33:40.200 --> 33:41.580]  Sports, online, personal...
[33:42.220 --> 33:42.940]  no targeting.
[33:43.660 --> 33:44.820]  Why should you use ExpressVPN?
[33:45.720 --> 33:47.580]  ExpressVPN reroutes your network data through
[33:47.580 --> 33:49.420]  a secure encrypted tunnel so your
[33:49.420 --> 33:51.520]  ISP can't see or
[33:51.520 --> 33:53.240]  sell your online activity. That's great.
[33:53.340 --> 33:55.300]  Don't want to be targeted. Avoid it at all costs.
[33:55.700 --> 33:57.160]  It's so simple to use.
[33:57.300 --> 33:59.140]  Fire up the app and click one button.
[33:59.240 --> 34:01.700]  It is super easy. Someone who has used ExpressVPN,
[34:02.160 --> 34:03.080]  the setup is
[34:03.520 --> 34:05.620]  great. You just click a button as they say.
[34:05.960 --> 34:06.980]  Really simple to install.
[34:07.380 --> 34:09.420]  It's great. It's rated number one by
[34:09.420 --> 34:11.560]  CNET and TechRadar. That does not surprise
[34:11.560 --> 34:13.420]  me at all. And it works on your phones,
[34:13.600 --> 34:15.380]  laptops, even routers, so everyone who
[34:15.380 --> 34:16.900]  shares your Wi-Fi can be protected.
[34:17.540 --> 34:19.020]  I use ExpressVPN
[34:20.040 --> 34:21.040]  especially during the
[34:21.040 --> 34:23.160]  time of the Spelling Bee because you can access content
[34:23.160 --> 34:25.120]  in other countries and they don't show
[34:25.120 --> 34:26.940]  the Spelling Bee in Canada. It's only streaming
[34:26.940 --> 34:29.020]  on a US platform. So I
[34:29.020 --> 34:30.940]  love ExpressVPN because that's one of my favorite
[34:30.940 --> 34:33.000]  events of the year and I wouldn't be able to watch it without
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.080]  them. So if you want to protect your online

[34:53.540 --> 34:54.900]  This show is sponsored by
[34:54.900 --> 34:57.040]  BetterHelp. It is so
[34:57.040 --> 34:59.020]  important to try to create time for
[34:59.020 --> 35:01.040]  yourself. We're just week
[35:01.040 --> 35:03.000]  to week and it's something that I'm not always the
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.080]  best at, but it is
[35:05.080 --> 35:06.700]  essential, I have found.
[35:06.920 --> 35:08.980]  For me, if I don't, it leads to burnout
[35:08.980 --> 35:11.040]  and it leads to all sorts of negatives
[35:11.040 --> 35:13.020]  and it's just so easy to get caught up in
[35:13.020 --> 35:14.960]  what everyone else needs from you and to never
[35:14.960 --> 35:17.080]  take a moment to think about what you need from yourself
[35:17.500 --> 35:18.280]  which is
[35:19.120 --> 35:21.080]  if you're not taking that time
[35:21.080 --> 35:23.060]  you're not going to be able to serve the people around
[35:23.060 --> 35:24.820]  you in the way that you'd want to or at least
[35:24.820 --> 35:26.600]  that's how it is in my experience.
[35:27.740 --> 35:29.080]  But when we spend all our time
[35:29.080 --> 35:31.120]  giving, it can leave us feeling stretched
[35:31.120 --> 35:33.100]  thin and burned out. Therapy
[35:33.100 --> 35:35.200]  can give you the tools to find more balance in your life
[35:35.200 --> 35:37.080]  so you can keep supporting others without leaving
[35:37.080 --> 35:37.980]  yourself behind.
[35:38.900 --> 35:41.180]  Therapy is something that has been huge
[35:41.180 --> 35:43.160]  in my life. I talk about it every time I do one
[35:43.160 --> 35:44.820]  of these. It just was a really
[35:45.840 --> 35:47.260]  impactful experience in
[35:47.260 --> 35:49.480]  giving me tools and how to manage
[35:49.480 --> 35:51.080]  all sorts of different
[35:51.080 --> 35:53.180]  situations. It's something I would highly
[35:53.180 --> 35:53.880]  recommend to anyone.
[35:55.640 --> 35:57.080]  So if you are
[35:57.080 --> 35:59.200]  thinking of starting out therapy, give BetterHelp

[36:23.420 --> 36:24.740]  Have a look at this.
[36:25.680 --> 36:27.040]  Everyone there? Are we all good?
[36:27.100 --> 36:28.980]  We see Pequot Lakes there?
[36:29.100 --> 36:30.360]  Hold on. Yep.
[36:31.200 --> 36:32.360]  I see it.
[36:32.460 --> 36:34.500]  Geoff, you see it? I see it.
[36:34.720 --> 36:37.100]  What state are we in?
[36:37.100 --> 36:39.240]  This is Pequot Lakes. This is Minnesota.
[36:39.580 --> 36:40.140]  Okay.
[36:40.400 --> 36:43.080]  Oh, here's
[36:43.080 --> 36:44.120]  where we're going to be.
[36:44.580 --> 36:44.860]  Okay.
[36:53.330 --> 36:54.450]  Well, yeah.
[36:56.590 --> 36:57.150]  So...
[36:57.150 --> 36:58.590]  I don't mean...
[36:59.490 --> 37:00.550]  How long of an
[37:00.550 --> 37:01.790]  XLR cable you got here?
[37:01.970 --> 37:03.370]  Let me google map that.
[37:03.790 --> 37:06.530]  I wasn't saying record it from the bean hole days.
[37:06.690 --> 37:08.570]  I'm saying...
[37:08.570 --> 37:10.590]  It's close...
[37:10.590 --> 37:11.130]  Austin.
[37:12.090 --> 37:14.690]  No. I'm so not on your side
[37:14.690 --> 37:16.670]  anymore. You've completely moved
[37:16.670 --> 37:17.490]  the goal post.
[37:17.910 --> 37:20.730]  The state that borders
[37:20.730 --> 37:22.350]  Canada? Yeah.
[37:22.630 --> 37:24.910]  There's all sorts of places you can go to that does that.
[37:25.410 --> 37:26.550]  Well, I mean, this is the closest
[37:26.550 --> 37:28.370]  we've been in three years. What do you want from us?
[37:28.790 --> 37:29.690]  We went to...
[37:31.850 --> 37:32.690]  San Francisco.
[37:32.890 --> 37:34.550]  That's probably close. Weren't you just in LA?
[37:34.970 --> 37:36.050]  That's pretty close.
[37:36.210 --> 37:36.930]  It's a lot closer.
[37:39.550 --> 37:40.350]  Three hours
[37:40.350 --> 37:41.630]  up to Baudette.
[37:43.970 --> 37:45.330]  Yeah, we did a...
[37:45.330 --> 37:47.070]  Didn't we do a live show in Seattle?
[37:47.650 --> 37:48.090]  Yeah, we did.
[37:49.090 --> 37:50.490]  Baudette is up on the border.
[37:51.470 --> 37:53.210]  But where in Canada...
[37:53.210 --> 37:54.750]  Do you scroll up?
[37:55.270 --> 37:57.150]  You can get to provinces that...
[37:57.150 --> 37:58.890]  I mean, Winnipeg is
[37:58.890 --> 38:01.030]  five hours. It's on the other side of Canada.
[38:01.390 --> 38:03.390]  Yeah, I was going to say, is this Manitoba?
[38:04.370 --> 38:05.070]  Yeah, it's...
[38:05.070 --> 38:06.250]  Yeah, this is Ontario.
[38:06.910 --> 38:08.070]  Right next to Winnipeg.
[38:08.870 --> 38:11.130]  So it's Ontario. Are you cool?
[38:11.290 --> 38:13.170]  Do you like... Would you rather us
[38:13.870 --> 38:15.010]  be on the border of
[38:15.610 --> 38:16.050]  Winnipeg?
[38:16.270 --> 38:18.530]  Or be on the border of Ontario?
[38:19.130 --> 38:21.050]  It would be more convenient for me to go to
[38:21.050 --> 38:21.410]  Austin.
[38:23.090 --> 38:24.610]  If you want...
[38:25.670 --> 38:26.850]  We can meet in
[38:26.850 --> 38:29.050]  Sleman. Do you want to go to Sleman?
[38:29.050 --> 38:30.350]  Oh, hell yeah.
[38:33.230 --> 38:34.630]  We can... Here's the thing.
[38:34.710 --> 38:36.870]  Here's the border. Let's see.
[38:37.290 --> 38:39.150]  There's a lake woods. We can run
[38:39.150 --> 38:41.130]  it over... It looks like there's a
[38:41.130 --> 38:42.850]  bridge in Baudette.
[38:43.070 --> 38:45.390]  There is a custom, so that's not going to work for us.
[38:45.570 --> 38:46.970]  Custom doesn't allow us to do that there.
[38:48.990 --> 38:51.170]  We're going to be to the point where we're just far enough away
[38:51.170 --> 38:53.110]  where we can't hear each other in real life and we're going to have to be
[38:53.110 --> 38:55.110]  on Discord, but from like a hundred feet
[38:55.110 --> 38:57.230]  apart. So it'll just be what we're doing
[38:57.230 --> 38:59.330]  now, but somehow...
[38:59.330 --> 39:01.250]  Somewhere way more inconvenient. I keep zooming
[39:01.250 --> 39:02.550]  out. It's so far away.
[39:03.230 --> 39:04.270]  Alright, but here's my point, right?
[39:04.770 --> 39:06.810]  Zoom out so you have the whole line in. Zoom out.
[39:07.190 --> 39:07.770]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:09.490 --> 39:10.830]  Now go down to Austin.
[39:13.330 --> 39:14.330]  See, that's a lot further.
[39:16.110 --> 39:17.330]  Right? I guess so, but I guess
[39:17.330 --> 39:19.190]  it wasn't really proposed that we run an XLR
[39:19.190 --> 39:20.830]  cable from Andrew's house to Austin.
[39:26.100 --> 39:28.080]  What about Wheeler's Point? You ever been to
[39:28.080 --> 39:29.920]  Wheeler's Point, Andrew? We can head on to
[39:29.920 --> 39:32.000]  Wheeler's Point. That's pretty
[39:32.000 --> 39:32.900]  short, right here.
[39:34.280 --> 39:35.700]  What if we get a boat
[39:35.700 --> 39:37.760]  and we go out, look, look at this.
[39:37.780 --> 39:40.420]  Look at that little spit. Look at this.
[39:41.120 --> 39:41.920]  That's a nice
[39:42.460 --> 39:44.000]  bit of land to poach on.
[39:44.020 --> 39:46.100]  It'll be July in Minnesota.
[39:46.380 --> 39:48.080]  It's probably warm. We swim out to
[39:48.080 --> 39:49.520]  this thing. We toss. Nick will
[39:49.920 --> 39:52.100]  sort of lasso a cable over to this side,
[39:52.220 --> 39:53.780]  which is right at the end of the road.
[39:54.280 --> 39:55.260]  Andrew, you
[39:55.260 --> 39:57.220]  and you come on out over here
[39:57.220 --> 39:59.240]  and then we'll be over here and then we'll talk about
[39:59.240 --> 40:01.160]  bean holes. Am I still in the same state?
[40:01.280 --> 40:03.040]  Hang on. Oh, two boats.
[40:03.300 --> 40:04.920]  Close, yeah. Oh, boats is good.
[40:07.280 --> 40:09.140]  So anyway, we're not gonna do this, but
[40:09.140 --> 40:11.420]  we'll figure something else out. How about this?
[40:11.520 --> 40:12.920]  It looks like we could go to
[40:12.920 --> 40:15.060]  Peace Arch Historical Park
[40:15.060 --> 40:16.380]  in Washington
[40:16.820 --> 40:19.060]  and the park straddles the border.
[40:19.480 --> 40:21.280]  Washington? Yeah, I mean it might be a different
[40:21.280 --> 40:23.240]  trip, but... Why would I try to
[40:23.240 --> 40:24.500]  solve for a different trip?
[40:25.180 --> 40:27.340]  Look at that border crossing right there.
[40:27.420 --> 40:29.380]  I still like the idea
[40:29.380 --> 40:31.420]  of us doing a cross-country
[40:31.420 --> 40:32.340]  podcast live.
[40:33.460 --> 40:35.120]  Even if it's not this particular one.
[40:35.760 --> 40:37.000]  That's perfect. Where is that, Andrew?
[40:37.780 --> 40:39.540]  I don't know. I'm not sure where that is.
[40:39.600 --> 40:41.240]  Okay, great. Well, that's fucking useless.
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.020]  I think it's Point Roberts.
[40:43.300 --> 40:44.320]  I think it's somewhere in Point Roberts.
[40:46.420 --> 40:47.000]  Pretty sure.
[40:47.600 --> 40:49.340]  So is the right America
[40:49.340 --> 40:50.480]  or the left America?
[40:50.480 --> 40:52.600]  The Canadian flag
[40:52.600 --> 40:54.260]  on the building would probably
[40:54.260 --> 40:56.140]  make me think that that is... So Canada
[40:56.140 --> 40:58.620]  is about two feet taller than America.
[40:58.980 --> 40:59.760]  Yeah, just a little.
[41:00.440 --> 41:02.400]  It seems like. It doesn't quite
[41:02.400 --> 41:04.460]  perfectly line up. That's really unfortunate.
[41:05.180 --> 41:06.540]  I bet they started opposite ends
[41:06.540 --> 41:07.840]  and then they got to that point where it's like, oh,
[41:08.140 --> 41:10.460]  close enough. We could do like a home
[41:10.460 --> 41:12.480]  improvement thing and talk through the hedges.
[41:12.960 --> 41:13.740]  It's great.
[41:14.600 --> 41:16.200]  That must be fun being able to
[41:16.200 --> 41:18.520]  open your window and spit into a
[41:18.520 --> 41:18.960]  different country.
[41:21.720 --> 41:22.620]  Who do you call?
[41:22.840 --> 41:24.720]  Like when somebody's spitting into your country,
[41:24.820 --> 41:26.640]  who do you call? Their police
[41:26.640 --> 41:28.580]  or yours? Call the Canadian police
[41:28.580 --> 41:30.520]  and he's going to be like, what do you want me to do? The guys in America.
[41:30.680 --> 41:32.540]  You call the American police and they're going to be like, I don't give a shit.
[41:32.720 --> 41:33.920]  Spit on all of Canada. What do we care?
[41:34.560 --> 41:36.740]  It's a perfect crime. Okay, so we are going to Beanhole
[41:36.740 --> 41:38.200]  Days or? Yes!
[41:38.440 --> 41:40.440]  Okay, I'm just making sure. Sorry, that
[41:40.440 --> 41:42.340]  seemed aggressive, but yes. Yes!
[41:42.760 --> 41:44.520]  I will say it didn't just seem aggressive.
[41:44.700 --> 41:46.380]  It was. I support the idea
[41:46.380 --> 41:48.000]  that you guys do like a scouting trip.
[41:48.080 --> 41:50.140]  And as long as, if there's a legal,
[41:50.340 --> 41:52.320]  like a definitive, absolutely
[41:52.320 --> 41:54.540]  there's no way I can get in trouble that I'm
[41:54.540 --> 41:56.420]  in. How can you get in trouble for going
[41:56.420 --> 41:58.300]  on vacation and eating beans?
[41:59.120 --> 41:59.820]  We're not...
[42:00.260 --> 42:02.120]  When we're making content based around that.
[42:02.120 --> 42:04.260]  We're not going to make content there. We'll make content
[42:04.260 --> 42:06.800]  later. Yeah, we'll just gather experiences.
[42:07.360 --> 42:08.260]  That's what we're doing now.
[42:08.360 --> 42:10.380]  Can you get in trouble? Are you going to get
[42:10.380 --> 42:12.340]  in trouble because we talk about going to pinballs
[42:12.340 --> 42:14.040]  together 12 years ago? Same thing.
[42:14.600 --> 42:15.900]  Yeah, it's like I used to go to
[42:16.720 --> 42:18.020]  RVBTO and stuff. I used to
[42:18.020 --> 42:20.060]  come back and talk about it. That doesn't mean I was
[42:20.060 --> 42:21.740]  working. I was just attending something.
[42:23.500 --> 42:23.820]  Uh...
[42:23.820 --> 42:25.520]  I don't... Okay. When I was a fan.
[42:25.720 --> 42:28.240]  Listen, I'm just nervous about it. I understand.
[42:28.480 --> 42:29.700]  As long as it's clear.
[42:30.080 --> 42:31.760]  As long as that's my only hindrance.
[42:32.280 --> 42:33.860]  As long as it's definitive
[42:33.860 --> 42:35.680]  I cannot get in trouble for this, I'm in.
[42:36.180 --> 42:37.920]  So in this picture, the two Canadians
[42:37.920 --> 42:39.880]  are both wearing hoodies. Would you say hoodies are
[42:39.880 --> 42:41.780]  pretty popular in Canada? Is that what a lot of people wear?
[42:41.780 --> 42:43.880]  I would say hoodies are popular
[42:43.880 --> 42:45.080]  everywhere. Would you not?
[42:45.500 --> 42:48.160]  Well, I would say there are two Americans
[42:48.160 --> 42:49.600]  clearly not wearing hoodies
[42:49.600 --> 42:51.740]  and there are two Canadians and they clearly are wearing hoodies.
[42:52.260 --> 42:53.880]  I think that's... it seems to me
[42:53.880 --> 42:56.080]  100% of Canadians wear hoodies and 0%
[42:56.080 --> 42:57.820]  of Americans, at least according to this photo.
[42:58.140 --> 42:59.860]  I feel like you would be the one to
[42:59.860 --> 43:00.940]  have that knowledge.
[43:02.100 --> 43:04.000]  As far as the percentage of America goes.
[43:04.320 --> 43:05.520]  You've never seen a hoodie in the wild?
[43:06.980 --> 43:07.940]  Uh... I mean, I
[43:07.940 --> 43:09.940]  own a few. I definitely have seen them. It just seems like
[43:09.940 --> 43:11.880]  there's a higher percentage, at least according to
[43:11.880 --> 43:13.680]  this empirical evidence I have of Canadians
[43:13.680 --> 43:15.800]  wearing hoodies. Primary color, like just
[43:15.800 --> 43:17.240]  single color hoodies. Interesting.
[43:18.080 --> 43:19.520]  Yeah. Did you ever
[43:19.520 --> 43:21.360]  pray for something and it came true?
[43:22.420 --> 43:22.940]  Um...
[43:23.800 --> 43:25.480]  Hmm... I don't think so.
[43:26.620 --> 43:27.900]  I wanted the Choco Taco
[43:27.900 --> 43:29.200]  to come back and then it did.
[43:29.500 --> 43:31.620]  But then I haven't eaten one since.
[43:33.140 --> 43:34.020]  So it's like
[43:34.020 --> 43:35.960]  is the power of
[43:35.960 --> 43:38.180]  prayer even worth it if you're just gonna squander it?
[43:38.180 --> 43:40.020]  And also like the fine prayer. Do I have to
[43:40.020 --> 43:42.100]  actually pray? Because my praying percentage
[43:42.100 --> 43:44.100]  is pretty low. I haven't shot a lot of
[43:44.100 --> 43:44.900]  prayers out there.
[43:45.640 --> 43:48.340]  I hadn't either. This is when I was at school
[43:48.340 --> 43:50.260]  and I went to a Catholic
[43:50.260 --> 43:51.540]  school so we had to pray a lot.
[43:52.120 --> 43:53.780]  But you know, I also taught not to ask
[43:55.080 --> 43:56.360]  God for specific
[43:56.360 --> 43:56.820]  things.
[43:58.620 --> 43:59.080]  And uh...
[43:59.800 --> 44:02.300]  One day, I came home from school
[44:02.300 --> 44:04.440]  and I saw an episode of The Mask
[44:04.440 --> 44:06.040]  like the animated Cartoon Network
[44:06.040 --> 44:07.220]  version of The Mask
[44:08.080 --> 44:10.040]  and I started like halfway through the
[44:10.040 --> 44:12.020]  episode and I thought, ah, this episode's so cool.
[44:13.100 --> 44:13.900]  And uh...
[44:13.900 --> 44:16.140]  I missed the beginning. And then like months
[44:16.140 --> 44:17.920]  and months later it happened again. I was like,
[44:17.980 --> 44:20.180]  ah, it's this... I've been trying to see this episode
[44:20.180 --> 44:22.060]  from the beginning. And I was like,
[44:22.080 --> 44:23.280]  ah, it's not gonna be on for months.
[44:23.820 --> 44:26.160]  But maybe I can pray for it.
[44:26.320 --> 44:28.300]  And I prayed to God
[44:28.300 --> 44:29.700]  and asked him specifically.
[44:32.400 --> 44:34.220]  And like within a week, for some reason,
[44:34.220 --> 44:36.180]  it was on again. And I watched it.
[44:36.320 --> 44:38.440]  I watched the whole thing. I was like, how did The Mask
[44:38.440 --> 44:40.300]  get like smashed in half?
[44:40.740 --> 44:42.320]  And at that point, I was like,
[44:43.120 --> 44:44.240]  maybe God's real.
[44:44.960 --> 44:46.240]  Was this before or after
[44:46.240 --> 44:47.540]  you drank his holy water?
[44:48.520 --> 44:48.860]  Uh...
[44:49.640 --> 44:51.040]  It was probably before.
[44:52.680 --> 44:54.220]  I think any
[44:54.220 --> 44:55.300]  line you had
[44:56.040 --> 44:57.800]  to prayers getting answered might have
[44:57.800 --> 44:59.880]  got cut short when you drank
[44:59.880 --> 45:01.860]  20-year-old holy water off your parents'
[45:01.860 --> 45:02.920]  kitchen counter.
[45:03.200 --> 45:05.580]  Yeah, it was in the windowsill. So it was not only
[45:05.580 --> 45:07.340]  holy water, it was like holy water that
[45:07.340 --> 45:09.700]  had been in a plastic container in the sun
[45:09.700 --> 45:10.740]  for 20 years.
[45:12.580 --> 45:13.660]  Might be the worst thing
[45:13.660 --> 45:14.640]  that I ever put in my mouth.
[45:15.260 --> 45:17.400]  Well, I mean, there's not a lot of ranges for that.
[45:17.640 --> 45:19.480]  The context, guys. We gotta
[45:20.460 --> 45:21.840]  reign in this out of context.
[45:22.360 --> 45:23.420]  Like, these are some strong sentences.
[45:23.420 --> 45:24.440]  I think that was in context.
[45:25.160 --> 45:26.840]  There's some strong sentences here.
[45:27.280 --> 45:30.140]  It's just really prevalent in these last two episodes, fellas.
[45:30.700 --> 45:31.260]  Which one?
[45:31.820 --> 45:34.080]  What do you mean? Which one? Like, what did you say?
[45:34.140 --> 45:34.980]  That could be out of context?
[45:35.880 --> 45:36.960]  Worst thing in my mouth?
[45:37.800 --> 45:39.700]  I'm a fucking idiot. I just stepped on that.
[45:41.240 --> 45:42.620]  Let me make it
[45:42.620 --> 45:44.320]  nice and clear for you, Nick, so you can grab it
[45:44.320 --> 45:45.920]  if you want to. Worst thing...
[45:45.920 --> 45:47.220]  God, was that one too?
[45:47.440 --> 45:50.360]  What did I say? Was that also...
[45:50.360 --> 45:51.320]  Yeah, this is...
[45:51.320 --> 45:53.120]  You're having a tough time.
[45:53.200 --> 45:55.880]  I never... This isn't a pray
[45:55.880 --> 45:57.780]  for thing, but when
[45:59.040 --> 46:00.160]  the Black Keys
[46:00.160 --> 46:01.200]  a long time ago
[46:01.200 --> 46:03.240]  put out an album, and they had that song,
[46:03.520 --> 46:05.020]  Gold on the Ceiling, was one of their albums.
[46:05.440 --> 46:07.780]  I was like, this would be a great hockey goal song.
[46:08.380 --> 46:09.960]  I was like, it'd be really cool if this was
[46:09.960 --> 46:11.460]  the Canucks goal song.
[46:11.840 --> 46:13.720]  And then they did it, but they used
[46:13.720 --> 46:15.600]  the wrong sequence of the song,
[46:15.700 --> 46:17.260]  in my opinion, and I hated it.
[46:17.760 --> 46:19.340]  So I spent, like, passively
[46:19.760 --> 46:21.740]  a month or so just being like, oh, it'd be so
[46:21.740 --> 46:23.340]  cool if they made this their goal song.
[46:23.640 --> 46:25.860]  Then was so excited when I saw that they did.
[46:25.860 --> 46:28.280]  And then was just completely disappointed
[46:28.280 --> 46:29.640]  in their use of it.
[46:30.320 --> 46:31.880]  Devastated. I don't think I've ever
[46:31.880 --> 46:33.860]  prayed for a thing that then
[46:33.860 --> 46:37.000]  happened. I think, uh...
[46:37.000 --> 46:37.620]  I don't know.
[46:40.100 --> 46:40.900]  What do you mean?
[46:41.160 --> 46:42.160]  What is happening
[46:42.160 --> 46:43.360]  in the last ten minutes?
[46:44.440 --> 46:45.500]  Where are you?
[46:45.780 --> 46:47.840]  Are you guys okay? Geoff asked if
[46:47.840 --> 46:50.100]  hoodies are popular. What is
[46:50.100 --> 46:50.440]  happening?
[46:52.320 --> 46:54.080]  Are you guys just out of
[46:54.080 --> 46:55.800]  state? Somebody blindside someone.
[46:56.060 --> 46:57.220]  What's going on?
[46:58.400 --> 47:00.160]  I pray all the
[47:00.160 --> 47:01.640]  time that my teeth won't hurt anymore.
[47:02.220 --> 47:03.460]  Oh, that's working great.
[47:03.880 --> 47:05.000]  So far, so good.
[47:06.400 --> 47:08.220]  Hey, I want to buy something.
[47:08.400 --> 47:10.160]  Eric, this is a real conversation.
[47:10.540 --> 47:12.160]  Maybe this will make you happy. I want to buy something.
[47:12.220 --> 47:14.120]  Can we buy something? What is it you want
[47:14.120 --> 47:15.800]  to buy? So you know how
[47:15.800 --> 47:18.060]  we have the tuxedo, which is... actually,
[47:18.180 --> 47:19.240]  let me take it back a little bit.
[47:20.480 --> 47:20.880]  Tourism
[47:22.320 --> 47:23.200]  was invented
[47:24.600 --> 47:25.480]  because of
[47:25.480 --> 47:27.320]  religious relics, right?
[47:27.960 --> 47:29.540]  Churches started to, around
[47:29.540 --> 47:31.540]  the world, discover that if you
[47:31.540 --> 47:33.860]  said, hey, we got this piece of the cross
[47:33.860 --> 47:35.140]  or we've got this
[47:36.280 --> 47:37.520]  saint's jawbone or
[47:37.520 --> 47:39.660]  we've got Jesus' foreskin over here in the
[47:39.660 --> 47:40.840]  back room. I've been chasing that for a while.
[47:41.300 --> 47:43.500]  It's a great chase card. People would travel
[47:43.500 --> 47:45.500]  halfway across the world just to go
[47:45.500 --> 47:47.620]  there and they're like, wow, this is, you
[47:47.620 --> 47:49.620]  know, there's some power in
[47:49.620 --> 47:50.840]  this. And so
[47:51.940 --> 47:53.600]  I've been thinking a lot about how we
[47:54.200 --> 47:55.580]  have... our religious artifacts
[47:55.580 --> 47:56.900]  would be like the tuxedo, right?
[47:57.340 --> 47:59.700]  It's important to us and how we need to do
[47:59.700 --> 48:01.440]  more with that. And I was just thinking about how
[48:01.440 --> 48:03.520]  great that whole process was.
[48:03.840 --> 48:05.500]  Andrew finding it, the chase
[48:05.500 --> 48:07.620]  to get it, the hunt, just the fun of
[48:07.620 --> 48:09.660]  collectability in general. Obviously, I like
[48:09.660 --> 48:11.400]  that we make limited
[48:12.520 --> 48:13.580]  collectible items in
[48:13.580 --> 48:15.680]  our store and we do the break shows
[48:15.680 --> 48:17.520]  and stuff. And I got
[48:17.520 --> 48:19.380]  thinking, like, what else would make
[48:19.380 --> 48:21.420]  sense to have like the tuxedo?
[48:21.920 --> 48:23.560]  And the only thing I could come up with is that it
[48:23.560 --> 48:25.920]  would be great to have a movie prop from MVP2.
[48:26.040 --> 48:27.460]  I know we've talked about it occasionally
[48:27.460 --> 48:29.540]  in the past. And then also, I guess, Condorman
[48:30.200 --> 48:31.720]  because that's like the trifecta
[48:31.720 --> 48:33.600]  of our childhood movies.
[48:34.280 --> 48:35.680]  And I think it would just be awesome
[48:35.680 --> 48:37.460]  to have... and it would increase our
[48:37.460 --> 48:38.680]  pilgrimage power, right?
[48:39.440 --> 48:41.460]  Then pilgrims would come to look at our
[48:41.460 --> 48:43.740]  religious artifacts, our pieces of the cross
[48:43.740 --> 48:45.560]  or whatnot. And so I've been
[48:45.560 --> 48:47.560]  looking, I've been scouring the internet lately
[48:47.560 --> 48:49.660]  for MVP2 and
[48:49.660 --> 48:51.380]  Condorman movie props.
[48:51.660 --> 48:52.700]  And let me tell you,
[48:53.460 --> 48:55.720]  it's hard to find anything for Condorman.
[48:56.180 --> 48:57.400]  It's goddamn impossible
[48:57.400 --> 48:59.380]  for MVP2. It is like the
[48:59.380 --> 49:01.580]  second... it's like the second they
[49:01.580 --> 49:03.780]  yelled cut on that film
[49:03.780 --> 49:05.580]  it was like... it was the martini
[49:05.580 --> 49:07.640]  shot and they were done. They just started
[49:07.640 --> 49:09.660]  selling stuff out of the back of the
[49:09.660 --> 49:11.640]  truck. They're like, we're not gonna need any of this anymore. Just get rid
[49:11.640 --> 49:13.580]  of it. But what I
[49:13.580 --> 49:15.600]  did find, which isn't exactly a movie prop
[49:15.600 --> 49:17.160]  but it's Condorman related,
[49:17.340 --> 49:18.800]  is I found on eBay
[49:19.700 --> 49:21.600]  this, which is one of the
[49:21.600 --> 49:23.460]  Baskin Robbins ice cream signs
[49:23.460 --> 49:25.560]  for Condorman Crunch, which I think in
[49:25.560 --> 49:27.720]  some ways is just as apropos
[49:29.000 --> 49:29.640]  as a
[49:29.640 --> 49:30.920]  prop from the movie because
[49:31.380 --> 49:33.580]  the Condorman Crunch was like a big part of the
[49:33.580 --> 49:35.200]  whole thing. And I was wondering if
[49:35.200 --> 49:37.120]  what would we have to do
[49:37.120 --> 49:39.340]  to get a hold of that for
[49:40.100 --> 49:41.060]  our pilgrims?
[49:41.060 --> 49:42.600]  I think I can do it.
[49:42.740 --> 49:43.960]  I gotta talk.
[49:45.400 --> 49:47.100]  For that price, I think I
[49:47.100 --> 49:48.600]  can do it because it's not
[49:48.600 --> 49:50.380]  thousands. No, it's like $350.
[49:50.920 --> 49:51.340]  Yeah.
[49:53.180 --> 49:55.120]  Let me see what I can do
[49:55.120 --> 49:57.060]  and I'll get back to you because I do think
[49:57.060 --> 49:58.760]  that this is something we should probably have
[49:58.760 --> 50:00.980]  and I can't believe I'm saying that
[50:00.980 --> 50:02.840]  because it's not something we need.
[50:03.260 --> 50:05.200]  But what's the goal? So, we acquire
[50:05.200 --> 50:06.700]  it and then what's the next step? Right.
[50:06.980 --> 50:08.940]  I think it goes into part of like this...
[50:08.940 --> 50:10.900]  I think Geoff is trying to like really expand
[50:10.900 --> 50:13.160]  our museum. Yeah, I really want to turn the museum
[50:13.160 --> 50:14.740]  into a thing. I really want... I want people to...
[50:14.740 --> 50:16.700]  I want pilgrimages to our
[50:17.360 --> 50:18.960]  face Mecca. And if we ever
[50:18.960 --> 50:20.340]  get an office, that's great for the wall.
[50:20.620 --> 50:22.740]  That'd be great for the wall. And then it'd be like, yeah,
[50:22.760 --> 50:24.440]  we'd have our own little museum wherever we go.
[50:24.740 --> 50:26.840]  And then like, I'm gonna hold
[50:26.840 --> 50:28.600]  out hope that... and maybe somebody in the audience
[50:28.600 --> 50:30.860]  can help us find MVP 2 props.
[50:31.200 --> 50:32.860]  But if we don't, I've been brainstorming how
[50:32.860 --> 50:34.500]  we can come up with something.
[50:34.900 --> 50:36.440]  What if we could get a skateboard
[50:36.440 --> 50:38.440]  that was ridden by a monkey?
[50:38.800 --> 50:40.320]  Like that would be something, right?
[50:41.060 --> 50:42.260]  Like if we could find a monkey
[50:42.260 --> 50:44.540]  in a skateboard, have the monkey ride the skateboard, like that's
[50:44.540 --> 50:46.420]  something. Maybe if it's a Bob Burnquist
[50:46.420 --> 50:47.600]  board, then there would be some
[50:49.580 --> 50:50.380]  threading. I
[50:50.380 --> 50:52.040]  follow a monkey on
[50:52.040 --> 50:53.800]  TikTok that rides a skateboard.
[50:54.420 --> 50:56.480]  Oh, do they... does he
[50:56.480 --> 50:58.320]  sell his old skateboards? I bet I could
[50:58.320 --> 51:00.900]  probably reach out and see if we could buy...
[51:00.900 --> 51:02.340]  Maybe it's like, hey, sell us
[51:02.340 --> 51:04.660]  this skateboard, we'll buy the monkey a new skateboard.
[51:05.700 --> 51:06.700]  You know what I mean?
[51:06.780 --> 51:08.680]  Like I think that's probably just part of it, where like
[51:08.680 --> 51:10.260]  you just have to buy the monkey a new skateboard.
[51:11.920 --> 51:12.320]  Um...
[51:12.320 --> 51:14.500]  I feel like people don't like
[51:15.560 --> 51:16.580]  watching the monkey
[51:16.580 --> 51:18.860]  that I like. Um...
[51:19.960 --> 51:20.360]  Like...
[51:20.980 --> 51:23.080]  I think that they think it's weird.
[51:24.060 --> 51:24.700]  Yeah, I think there's
[51:24.700 --> 51:25.580]  maybe some ethics.
[51:26.280 --> 51:28.600]  Does it have like, bozoi vibes?
[51:29.240 --> 51:30.100]  Well, here.
[51:30.640 --> 51:32.820]  You tell me. It's gonna be a thing, isn't it?
[51:32.820 --> 51:35.000]  It's a monkey that rides a skateboard.
[51:35.180 --> 51:36.080]  It lives with a dog.
[51:36.440 --> 51:38.860]  And it's like, it walks around.
[51:39.640 --> 51:40.300]  And it...
[51:41.100 --> 51:43.060]  Like, watch, and it rides a skateboard.
[51:43.980 --> 51:44.980]  His name is Kiki
[51:44.980 --> 51:46.040]  the Spider Monkey.
[51:46.720 --> 51:48.420]  But why does someone have that?
[51:49.320 --> 51:50.820]  See, this is what happens when people
[51:50.820 --> 51:52.480]  start going like, I don't like that they keep a monkey.
[51:52.660 --> 51:54.700]  I'm not here to talk about the ethics of the monkey. I like
[51:54.700 --> 51:56.880]  watching the monkey ride the skateboard. I don't care.
[51:57.260 --> 51:58.460]  That's a pretty cute monkey.
[51:58.560 --> 52:00.820]  Right? And then it's just kind of like getting into mischief.
[52:00.820 --> 52:02.040]  And like, being playful.
[52:02.220 --> 52:04.520]  You have to watch to the end. It's like playful.
[52:05.180 --> 52:06.200]  It's like being fun.
[52:06.660 --> 52:07.620]  He slides on his butt.
[52:08.780 --> 52:09.980]  He's a pretty good skater.
[52:10.220 --> 52:11.740]  To be fair, that's a sick setup.
[52:12.540 --> 52:14.420]  It's not bad. It's pretty cool.
[52:14.780 --> 52:15.720]  And rides a skateboard around.
[52:16.960 --> 52:18.140]  What a cutie.
[52:18.560 --> 52:20.520]  Is that what you're hoping for, Geoff?
[52:20.640 --> 52:23.000]  I mean, like, what I'm hoping for
[52:23.000 --> 52:24.260]  is a monkey...
[52:24.760 --> 52:27.020]  What I'm hoping for is a skateboard ridden by
[52:27.020 --> 52:28.640]  one of the monkeys in MVP2.
[52:28.640 --> 52:30.620]  Or like, a prop from the film.
[52:30.780 --> 52:32.340]  Like a pair of pants from
[52:32.340 --> 52:34.800]  the guy from Tool Time
[52:34.800 --> 52:35.300]  or whatever.
[52:36.760 --> 52:38.160]  What was the name of the guy?
[52:38.300 --> 52:38.880]  Richard Kind?
[52:39.160 --> 52:41.680]  Do you just want something from Richard Karn or whatever?
[52:41.920 --> 52:43.360]  No, I want something from the movie.
[52:44.020 --> 52:46.340]  I'm just saying, I would take anything from the film.
[52:46.760 --> 52:48.640]  But if I can't get it, then something
[52:48.640 --> 52:50.460]  in the spirit of or adjacent
[52:50.460 --> 52:51.180]  would be great.
[52:51.200 --> 52:54.180]  I think we should try to get in contact with them.
[52:54.460 --> 52:55.140]  The Air Bud people.
[52:55.140 --> 52:56.920]  They have to have something.
[52:57.180 --> 52:59.280]  You are the perfect person to do that.
[52:59.360 --> 53:01.680]  I've tried. I just don't. I've hit a dead end.
[53:01.940 --> 53:03.480]  What if we could get Richard Karn
[53:03.480 --> 53:04.420]  to ride a skateboard?
[53:05.440 --> 53:06.800]  Now that's interesting too.
[53:07.200 --> 53:08.720]  It's not really like MVP
[53:08.720 --> 53:10.940]  like true MVP, but it is
[53:10.940 --> 53:12.460]  so sort of like
[53:13.040 --> 53:14.600]  around it that I'm kind of into it.
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.880]  I mean, A, he owned a skateboarding shop
[53:16.880 --> 53:19.220]  so it makes sense. And B, it's probably
[53:19.220 --> 53:21.380]  more ethical in some way to get Richard Karn
[53:21.380 --> 53:23.040]  to ride a skateboard than it is to get a monkey.
[53:24.660 --> 53:25.140]  Probably.
[53:25.420 --> 53:25.980]  I'd agree with that.
[53:26.700 --> 53:28.000]  I have something for you to buy, Eric.
[53:28.740 --> 53:30.820]  It's another movie prop.
[53:32.100 --> 53:32.880]  It's a one of
[53:33.780 --> 53:34.700]  three, right?
[53:34.840 --> 53:36.440]  Three were made. One
[53:36.940 --> 53:39.140]  is owned by Christopher Columbus.
[53:39.700 --> 53:40.840]  The other is owned by
[53:40.840 --> 53:42.300]  the estate of Robert Williams.
[53:42.500 --> 53:44.380]  And the other one is up for auction!
[53:44.660 --> 53:45.140]  Oh!
[53:47.580 --> 53:48.540]  $30,000!
[53:49.580 --> 53:50.420]  The full
[53:50.420 --> 53:51.820]  Bicentennial Man suit
[53:52.210 --> 53:54.080]  is estimated to go between $60,000
[53:54.080 --> 53:55.660]  and $120,000.
[53:56.600 --> 53:58.340]  That's a little over my limit.
[53:58.420 --> 53:58.780]  I'm sorry.
[53:58.980 --> 54:01.400]  It's probably going to happen.
[54:02.100 --> 54:03.700]  Is this the suit he wore?
[54:04.760 --> 54:05.300]  Uh...
[54:07.180 --> 54:08.260]  Andrew Martins
[54:08.260 --> 54:09.960]  in brackets Robin Williams
[54:09.960 --> 54:12.300]  NDR 114 robot costume.
[54:13.220 --> 54:14.220]  Yeah, I don't know if Robin Williams
[54:14.220 --> 54:16.360]  actually ever was in there, but I don't know.
[54:18.760 --> 54:20.840]  I mean, it looks like him, if that helps.
[54:22.420 --> 54:24.200]  Williams wore the robot costume
[54:24.200 --> 54:25.820]  before transitioning into human form
[54:25.820 --> 54:26.720]  with the make-up effects.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.100]  It sounds like he did.
[54:29.120 --> 54:30.540]  That's a lot of money, though.
[54:31.780 --> 54:32.940]  You know what, though?
[54:33.240 --> 54:35.220]  We could put the tuxedo on him
[54:35.220 --> 54:36.320]  and he would look fucking great.
[54:36.500 --> 54:37.700]  I agree with that.
[54:39.800 --> 54:41.040]  We'd just make some weird
[54:41.040 --> 54:42.680]  Frankenstein prop monster
[54:42.680 --> 54:43.680]  from different movies.
[54:44.120 --> 54:46.200]  Why don't we turn vinyl profits
[54:46.200 --> 54:47.820]  into the Bicentennial Man?
[54:48.160 --> 54:50.180]  Oh yeah, all those vinyl profits.
[54:50.400 --> 54:51.880]  Yeah, all that vinyl.
[54:51.920 --> 54:54.280]  We just need to sell 120,000
[54:54.280 --> 54:54.960]  more records.
[54:57.460 --> 54:58.060]  Considering
[54:58.060 --> 54:59.940]  we printed 500 so far,
[55:00.420 --> 55:01.660]  we might have issues.
[55:02.900 --> 55:03.500]  Maybe.
[55:04.800 --> 55:06.160]  Yeah, I don't think we're going to be able
[55:06.160 --> 55:07.780]  to afford Bicentennial Man, sorry.
[55:08.120 --> 55:09.820]  Does anybody out there in the community
[55:09.820 --> 55:11.280]  have any interest in buying
[55:12.140 --> 55:14.420]  119,000 or so
[55:15.920 --> 55:16.640]  vinyl records
[55:17.280 --> 55:17.900]  from us?
[55:18.560 --> 55:20.200]  In bulk, we'll cut you a deal.
[55:21.960 --> 55:22.580]  I'm not waiting
[55:22.580 --> 55:24.240]  for a response, obviously they're not going to respond to me.
[55:24.240 --> 55:26.400]  Yeah, they've got to think about it, they've got to check
[55:26.400 --> 55:27.900]  their numbers. We'll get back to you.
[55:28.400 --> 55:30.360]  That's an interesting prop, though. Was there
[55:30.360 --> 55:32.360]  anything else, Gavin, that I'm assuming you
[55:32.360 --> 55:33.100]  looked at that recently?
[55:33.520 --> 55:36.420]  I sort of browsed through, but that was
[55:36.420 --> 55:37.440]  the one that was funny to me.
[55:38.240 --> 55:40.640]  I like the cheap auction stuff
[55:40.640 --> 55:41.840]  in there is always fun.
[55:41.840 --> 55:43.640]  Like the $100 things.
[55:44.600 --> 55:46.140]  Like a crew shirt or something?
[55:46.620 --> 55:48.000]  Yeah, or like there was
[55:48.920 --> 55:49.880]  a gold
[55:49.880 --> 55:52.020]  bar that was used for the promotion
[55:52.020 --> 55:53.520]  of Muppets Treasure Island.
[55:53.700 --> 55:55.420]  That was like $200. I was like, that's good.
[55:55.540 --> 55:57.060]  That would be good, though.
[55:57.480 --> 55:58.860]  I regret not getting in on that.
[56:00.940 --> 56:01.680]  Bicentennial Man.
[56:02.160 --> 56:03.680]  Should I watch Bicentennial Man?
[56:03.900 --> 56:05.780]  Is that worth watching? I don't think so.
[56:06.160 --> 56:07.080]  No. Okay.
[56:07.500 --> 56:09.960]  I was expecting a little bit
[56:09.960 --> 56:11.840]  more divide
[56:11.840 --> 56:12.760]  or enthusiasm.
[56:13.440 --> 56:15.420]  I don't remember it being good or bad.
[56:16.140 --> 56:18.120]  I remember having Sam Neill in it.
[56:18.860 --> 56:20.140]  The girl from Matilda.
[56:20.960 --> 56:22.240]  Or was it the teacher from Matilda?
[56:22.680 --> 56:23.480]  Wait, were both of them in it?
[56:23.620 --> 56:26.160]  Just to clarify, Sam Neill is not the girl from Matilda.
[56:26.580 --> 56:26.800]  Okay.
[56:27.440 --> 56:28.640]  Oh, okay.
[56:30.580 --> 56:32.020]  Do you think that there's a world
[56:32.020 --> 56:33.800]  where we could become like a Snoopy podcast?
[56:34.880 --> 56:36.100]  You're really into Snoopy.
[56:36.500 --> 56:38.320]  That's what I'm trying to...
[56:38.320 --> 56:39.960]  I can sort of pivot something into something
[56:39.960 --> 56:42.440]  that I'm interested in, like Snoopy.
[56:43.020 --> 56:44.340]  Now, is the Snoopy...
[56:45.880 --> 56:46.360]  Are you into
[56:46.360 --> 56:48.380]  official Snoopy merch, or could it be
[56:48.380 --> 56:50.000]  anything with Snoopy on it?
[56:50.120 --> 56:52.340]  It's not really anything. I think most stuff
[56:52.340 --> 56:53.540]  with Snoopy on it sucks.
[56:55.280 --> 56:56.200]  That's the problem.
[56:56.980 --> 56:58.420]  I mean, that's the problem
[56:58.420 --> 56:59.960]  with Snoopy.
[57:00.420 --> 57:02.080]  I like Snoopy, but
[57:02.080 --> 57:04.360]  it's sort of really watered down
[57:04.360 --> 57:05.920]  at this point. Come on, Snoopy.
[57:06.520 --> 57:07.840]  But I do think
[57:07.840 --> 57:09.860]  sometimes he shows up and he's wearing a hat and you go,
[57:09.900 --> 57:11.700]  oh, that's pretty fun. I like original Snoopy. You ever
[57:11.700 --> 57:13.040]  check out original Snoopy?
[57:13.660 --> 57:15.360]  What's the defining trait of Snoopy?
[57:16.140 --> 57:18.020]  I think he's precocious.
[57:19.020 --> 57:19.520]  You know what I mean?
[57:19.840 --> 57:20.680]  He's a man of few words.
[57:21.200 --> 57:23.680]  Even going back to original Snoopy,
[57:24.040 --> 57:24.980]  what's he doing up there?
[57:25.720 --> 57:27.800]  Oh, that's not Snoopy I'm used to.
[57:28.080 --> 57:29.740]  No, right? And so that's what I'm saying.
[57:29.880 --> 57:31.660]  People know Snoopy as
[57:31.660 --> 57:33.800]  what Snoopy is now, but original
[57:33.800 --> 57:35.800]  Snoopy, and this is why I'm trying to get
[57:35.800 --> 57:37.460]  maybe more people into Snoopy.
[57:37.780 --> 57:39.780]  Original Snoopy, really cool.
[57:40.120 --> 57:41.900]  So you want a back to basics Snoopy?
[57:42.120 --> 57:43.920]  I'm looking for Snoopy
[57:45.820 --> 57:47.460]  back to basics.
[57:47.580 --> 57:49.680]  It's like the number two and it's a reboot
[57:49.680 --> 57:51.680]  for Snoopy. I think that would be cool.
[57:52.300 --> 57:53.720]  So instead of like summer
[57:53.720 --> 57:55.640]  of 98, it'd be like
[57:56.440 --> 57:57.880]  summer of 58
[57:57.880 --> 57:59.820]  for Snoopy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, somewhere around there
[57:59.820 --> 58:01.900]  because this is sort of like the 60s
[58:01.900 --> 58:03.740]  I think is like the last time where we got
[58:03.740 --> 58:05.160]  he's like fucked up looking.
[58:05.500 --> 58:07.980]  They did not know
[58:07.980 --> 58:09.560]  what they wanted. There was an argument
[58:09.560 --> 58:10.980]  in like the creative
[58:11.720 --> 58:14.020]  and then whoever was arguing lost
[58:14.020 --> 58:15.060]  by the 70s.
[58:15.980 --> 58:17.960]  I can't find you
[58:17.960 --> 58:19.980]  any Snoopy related props
[58:19.980 --> 58:22.080]  directly. Eric, what about
[58:22.080 --> 58:23.600]  this? This is the closest I could get
[58:23.600 --> 58:26.100]  from the movie Dolemite is my name
[58:26.100 --> 58:28.400]  in 2019. Snoop Dogg's
[58:28.400 --> 58:29.980]  headphones from the movie.
[58:31.080 --> 58:32.100]  He played DJ
[58:32.100 --> 58:32.740]  Raj.
[58:34.300 --> 58:35.440]  I mean like
[58:37.040 --> 58:37.840]  that's cool.
[58:38.880 --> 58:39.460]  That's not
[58:39.460 --> 58:41.560]  the vibe you're going for. No, I mean
[58:42.400 --> 58:43.800]  that's cool, you know, that's like
[58:43.800 --> 58:44.260]  cool.
[58:45.640 --> 58:47.540]  I just can't believe what they did to Snoopy.
[58:47.920 --> 58:49.840]  What happened to him? That's what, okay, so
[58:49.840 --> 58:51.720]  thank you Gavin, that's what I'm saying.
[58:52.500 --> 58:53.820]  Also, that's what Snoop Dogg is
[58:53.820 --> 58:55.380]  named after. He's named after Snoopy.
[58:56.040 --> 58:58.140]  I can't believe he's never played Snoopy.
[58:58.140 --> 58:59.860]  Snoop Dogg as Snoopy?
[59:00.500 --> 59:02.240]  Yeah, like that has never
[59:02.240 --> 59:04.040]  officially happened as well. Yeah, why not?
[59:04.360 --> 59:05.700]  Yeah. Well,
[59:06.000 --> 59:08.100]  are we sure that's the case? Has Snoop Dogg
[59:08.100 --> 59:10.280]  ever played? I feel pretty confident.
[59:10.400 --> 59:12.300]  I feel like I've seen most of the Charlie Brown
[59:12.300 --> 59:13.840]  movies. I agree. Recent years. Yeah.
[59:14.920 --> 59:15.940]  I feel like I would
[59:15.940 --> 59:18.400]  imagine Snoop Dogg
[59:18.400 --> 59:19.500]  just sat on someone's head.
[59:19.960 --> 59:20.140]  Yeah.
[59:22.160 --> 59:23.940]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[59:24.220 --> 59:26.180]  What's up? When Snoop Dogg
[59:26.180 --> 59:28.100]  was a kid during the 70s, he used to
[59:28.100 --> 59:30.100]  watch so much Peanuts that his mom said he
[59:30.100 --> 59:31.760]  began to look like the character Snoopy.
[59:32.080 --> 59:34.160]  My mama gave me the name. I used to love Peanuts
[59:34.160 --> 59:36.400]  and Charlie Brown. I didn't realize that that's where Snoop Dogg
[59:36.400 --> 59:37.500]  came from. Yeah, that's where the name came from.
[59:38.460 --> 59:40.100]  Snoop Dogg is being named
[59:40.100 --> 59:42.080]  after Snoopy. Makes total sense,
[59:42.220 --> 59:44.220]  but I just never made the connection.
[59:44.680 --> 59:46.140]  Yep. Where did he get the second G
[59:46.140 --> 59:47.480]  from? Because he's a G.
[59:48.200 --> 59:49.520]  Yeah, I didn't think about that.
[59:51.080 --> 59:52.020]  He just had it in him.
[59:52.140 --> 59:53.960]  You ever see Snoopy in like Vulture mode?
[59:54.540 --> 59:55.800]  Snoopy in Vulture mode?
[59:56.160 --> 59:58.040]  What is...
[59:58.600 --> 59:59.960]  I'm the world famous
[59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.920]  Christmas vulture in a pear tree
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.560]  here to wish you a Merry Christmas.
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.900]  Eric, what would it take for you to get that
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.940]  tattooed? Now Nick is asking
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.380]  what's happening. I think
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:12.060]  I think I'd get a Snoopy tattoo. I don't
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.180]  know if it would be the vulture.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.920]  It'd have to be the vulture. The vulture's
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.080]  pretty good though, right? I like
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.920]  Snoopy in the big coat. Have you
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.940]  seen Snoopy in the big coat?
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:21.380]  No.
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.820]  Snoopy presentation
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:25.840]  show. Yeah.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.120]  Snoopy in the big coat
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.980]  is very cool. Snoopy
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.100]  in the big coat's good. Yeah.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.900]  What version of Snoopy is that? Is that 70s Snoopy?
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:37.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You get kind of into like 70s Snoopy.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.140]  I also like
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.000]  I like fucked up baseball
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.780]  Snoopy. I think that's a good one.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.720]  He's just kind of like weird looking.
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.120]  That's fun. This is a baseball podcast.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.960]  That looks like, honestly
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.600]  that looks like a soulless Snoopy.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.180]  Oh, wow.
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:54.060]  Like if there was a
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.000]  in science fiction terms, it's like a
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.700]  Snoopy replicant. Yeah.
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.960]  It's like the Rucker Hauer
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:01.460]  Snoopy.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.580]  That Snoopy would kill you.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.020]  Here's the thing. Here's what people
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.520]  are going to say. They're like, oh, get
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.100]  they're going to say get Spike.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:15.040]  I don't want Spike. Yeah, I don't want
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.480]  Spike. Is that a different dog?
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.480]  Yeah, that's his brother Spike, Gavin.
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:20.080]  I know nothing about Snoopy.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.420]  Is Snoopy not popular
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:23.660]  in the United Kingdom?
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:24.980]  Yeah, I think he is.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.420]  Let's spike his brother.
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.440]  Why do you hate Snoopy
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.440]  so much, Gavin?
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.280]  Just never really came across him.
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:36.140]  Too busy trying to watch the episode of The Mask.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.480]  I like...
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:40.500]  What I love about
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.600]  the show is that it is a group
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.580]  of grown men where one of them is asking
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:46.660]  have you seen this variation of Snoopy
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.640]  over and over again? To which
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.680]  it is always no. The answer is no.
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.740]  We have not. Or at least I haven't.
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:54.620]  All the Snoopy
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.760]  evolutions. All the Snoopy evolutions.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.900]  I don't know. There's just a lot to Snoopy.
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:00.980]  I just think he's pretty neat.
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.840]  And then you get into like 1990's Snoopy
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.680]  and you go like, I'm done with this. I don't need this anymore.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.580]  I just feel like at one point you sat down and started
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.780]  just Googling Snoopy there.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.600]  I grew up reading
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.760]  all these old comics. I'd go to the library
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.800]  and check out old Garfield. I love Garfield too.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.760]  Old Garfield comics and old
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.500]  Snoopy comics. And like the big
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:20.060]  books.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.900]  So what was the name of Snoopy's
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:24.880]  brother? Spike. Spike.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.520]  Do people in
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.800]  the Peanuts fandom view
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.880]  Spike in the same way they view Scrappy-Doo?
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.020]  Do people just hate Spike?
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.300]  I think Spike is pretty beloved.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.740]  But I'm just not.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.760]  It's me and people go
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.180]  you have a mustache and Spike has a mustache.
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:42.180]  It's like, yeah, but I'm a Snoopy guy.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.140]  I'll say this too. I think
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.160]  that as a whole
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.180]  the Peanuts audience
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.520]  the Peanuts fandom is
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.100]  pretty wholesome and non-toxic.
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:53.920]  I feel like they're not very
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.200]  judgmental with their characters. I feel like there's a lot of universal
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.400]  love across the Peanuts
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.080]  zeitgeist. How did you feel
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:00.840]  about Droopy?
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.880]  Droopy Dog? Yeah.
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.120]  I like Droopy Dog. He's fucking
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.080]  awesome. What, are you about to talk some shit about Droopy?
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.020]  No, I just feel like I've seen
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.000]  more Droopy than Snoopy.
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:14.220]  Do you think Droopy is a
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:16.060]  Do you think Droopy was created as
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.020]  a parody of Snoopy? That never
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.140]  crossed my mind until this second.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.020]  Is Droopy... What's the little
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:23.320]  Droopy? Like Dripple or something?
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:24.920]  Yeah, Droopy and Dribble.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.840]  His son or something.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:28.660]  What are we talking about?
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:29.700]  What is this?
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.680]  Why is this over here?
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:35.400]  He's not.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.480]  Yeah, but have you ever looked at the evolution of Garfield?
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.740]  I have. I have looked at the evolution of Garfield.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:40.960]  I would say 79.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.460]  79 is best Garfield.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.760]  So Snoop...
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.120]  Droopy is
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.240]  based off of this dude.
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:51.060]  Based off of what?
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.800]  That's who Droopy is based off of.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.060]  What?
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:56.820]  Bill Thompson?
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.060]  Wallace Wimple?
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:01.420]  Boomer? Are you Brimley-ing us again?
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.300]  Something from a Brimley situation?
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.420]  It says
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:06.420]  Wallace Wimple...
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:07.620]  People called him Boomer?
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.960]  Did you know that LL Cool J came up with the term goat?
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.160]  That was him.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.560]  Oh really? Greatest of all time?
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.960]  Yeah, I had no idea. I learned that recently.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.460]  Really? Yeah, that was his thing.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.100]  Technically, like his...
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:23.200]  Ali's wife trademarked the greatest of all time
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.920]  entertainment or something,
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.280]  but he's the one that created the vernacular
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:27.840]  around it.
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:28.940]  Interesting.
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:29.600]  Interesting.
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.880]  Are we going to learn more about Droopy or what?
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.300]  I don't know. I'm reading it and it's not
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:36.940]  interesting, so no.
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.980]  Well, none of this has been. That is not
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:40.780]  a barrier to entry in this conversation.
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:42.940]  Well, don't say that! There's been some interesting stuff
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:44.180]  in here, but I'm telling you.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.320]  An interesting fact that has happened.
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.940]  Are you basically saying that everything Eric added to the end of this podcast
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:49.700]  has been trash?
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.760]  No, listen, we all have a cross to bear.
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.300]  We've all made mistakes.
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.000]  Yeah, if anything, this is on you guys.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.300]  Geoff asked if hoodies are popular.
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.660]  In Canada!
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:00.880]  Based on the photo!
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.060]  Yeah, that's why the podcast took a turn. Maybe we should cut
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:04.820]  there.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.880]  To now!
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:10.120]  So, do you guys know
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.360]  about Snoopy's evolution?
[01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:12.580]  No!
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:15.940]  Yes, I mean yes.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:18.080]  Yes, I do.
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:19.400]  Let's see.
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.260]  Let me check my notes.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:24.800]  We should wrap up anyway. Get us out of here.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.760]  With Gavin's question
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.380]  of how did it feel, I laughed.
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.080]  I don't know what year it is anymore.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.760]  I feel like I've gone back in time.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.660]  I think I prayed so that that's the hottest you've laughed
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.480]  in one of the top three on the whole podcast.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.160]  And it wasn't even me trying to be funny.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.320]  That's way more than just three haws.
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.540]  That was at least twelve.
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.180]  Here's an idea
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:47.980]  for you guys.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.320]  You guys know how the mall is back?
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:51.180]  I do.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:53.540]  Conditionally,
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.880]  it's back in some places, not others,
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.860]  but it's back where we are.
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.080]  You know how much fun it is to go to the mall
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.580]  and how much I like to go to the mall
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.740]  and then I like to walk around the mall and look at stuff.
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:05.400]  We did the mall draft and we all really enjoyed that.
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.280]  It was a lot of fun and the audience liked it
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.180]  and they participated too.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.240]  I feel like there's a lot of mall content left we could come up with.
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.200]  I pitched this to Eric about a month ago.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.080]  What if we went
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.100]  to the mall together?
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.860]  Obviously, you couldn't go, Andrew, because you'd be working in America
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:19.840]  and you can't do that.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.360]  But what if we went to the mall together
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.960]  but then we called Andrew
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.340]  and Andrew was like
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:28.240]  Charlie's Angels
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.300]  and Andrew gave us tasks we have to complete in the mall.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:32.500]  He's like,
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.180]  Alright, be the first person to buy the smallest item
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.940]  in the mall or whatever, kind of like we did at the grocery store.
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.400]  And then we all run to the wind
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.660]  and then we try to be the first person to come back
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:43.340]  and complete
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:44.800]  the task that Andrew gives us
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.440]  in the mall.
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:47.780]  So you guys would show up
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:48.980]  as soon as it opened
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:51.040]  and you would learn the task then?
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.780]  Yeah, we would go and we'd sit around a table
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:55.420]  at the mall and eat
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.420]  Chick-fil-A or something and then you would
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.140]  tell us, you would be like, Alright, Angels
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.020]  or assholes or whatever you call us,
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.500]  you fuckers, here's your first task.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.660]  And you would be like, you need to go buy
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:06.520]  the biggest bra,
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:09.300]  biggest cup-sized bra they have at the mall or whatever
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.180]  and we'd have to go do it.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.240]  And then we'd all come back and compare.
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.160]  What mall? What's the grossest
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.000]  item you could get in the mall? It'd be in our mall.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:16.900]  Barton Creek.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.220]  Can I have somebody
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.180]  shoot the notes? You know like
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.140]  in the early Mission Impossible movies
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:25.940]  they'd shoot like an RPG
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:27.800]  of sunglasses that gave the...
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.580]  If I figure that out, can I do that?
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.860]  Can I deliver the message?
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.120]  Absolutely. And I could even, if you want, I could even
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.260]  go to the mall and just film all the
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:38.040]  stores for you and stuff to give you an idea.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.080]  Oh, I like... yeah.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.900]  That's a fun idea. What if there's like
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:43.960]  a hidden immunity item hidden somewhere
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.520]  in the mall and you have to find it or something?
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.000]  That's interesting. That's an interesting
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.260]  idea. I feel like this is going to make me uncomfortable.
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:51.360]  Oh.
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.980]  Just be fucking Errol. Just be Errol
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:56.060]  and you're fine. Yeah, just don't be Gavin.
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.600]  Yeah, just put on the Errol.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.340]  We all saw Longest, you've been a character.
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:02.260]  At one time.
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:06.120]  Is it just like, I feel like typically
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.780]  I get the sense it's like for a minute
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.660]  or like two minutes tops. Have you ever just been
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.640]  somebody else for like hours?
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:15.100]  No.
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.860]  Let me ask a tough
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.860]  question. Are you really
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:21.960]  Gavin? Is Gavin a character? Have you been
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.780]  a character for the last 20 years?
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.840]  Look, this is me, right? Here's a picture of me.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:28.800]  With a mask.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.800]  Also, we don't have to do the mall idea. I was just throwing
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.180]  that out there as an option someday.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:34.180]  I don't dislike it.
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:36.360]  I just want to go to the mall.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:38.320]  I want to fine tune it
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:39.360]  a little bit, but I like it.
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:41.380]  I like going to the mall with you guys. Like Eric
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:43.960]  and Gus and I filmed an episode of Anima
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.420]  at the mall and it was a lot of fun.
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:47.320]  It's fun being at the mall with your buddies.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.260]  What if we have for one of the challenges
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:51.560]  best Stuart impression?
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:53.700]  I know I couldn't say Stuart for like two whole seconds.
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.140]  That's a great one.
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:08:59.740]  Oh, 1100.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.620]  Is that good?
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.620]  Is that good or bad?
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.440]  It's not great.
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:07.340]  We gotta wrap it up so you don't die.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.940]  Geoff, you gotta take us out.
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.720]  Hey, thanks for listening to one of the
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.360]  weirder episodes we've had in a while.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.440]  It was a back-to-back today
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.600]  and the second one always slips away from us
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.160]  a little bit.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.580]  It'll be interesting to see what was and wasn't cut.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.500]  You won't know because you're the audience and you weren't here
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.540]  for the recording, but we'll all know and we'll go
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.320]  Yeah, that was probably a good choice.
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:29.900]  Anyway, if you didn't hear it,
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:31.520]  don't miss it. You didn't need to.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.260]  Thanks again for listening.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.440]  Tune in someday in the future for
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.460]  our mall show we're gonna do.
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.960]  Pretty excited about that. I also was gonna pitch the guys
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:41.960]  a one-star review
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.700]  game that I think will be a lot of fun
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.060]  that we can play anytime they want.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.180]  I've been holding onto that one for about two months now.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.520]  Played it with Eric and Emily in the car
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.520]  on the way back from San Antonio. It was pretty fucking fun.
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:52.900]  So we got that in the future.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:55.920]  If you didn't listen to or watch
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.760]  episode one
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.500]  of Blindside,
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.900]  hopefully you'll check that out because I assume
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:03.740]  that exists somewhere
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:04.240]  in the world.
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.780]  Next week will be episode 160.
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:09.920]  We've got nothing planned. We'll see you then.
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:10.280]  Bye.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.020]  ...how to flip off a camera, and once again
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.420]  Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.880]  All that and more on next week's episode of
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:34.480]  F*** Face.
