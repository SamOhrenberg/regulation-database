[00:09.560 --> 00:13.140]  I wonder if Andrew's going to get in at exactly 12 o'clock with Gavin.
[00:15.280 --> 00:22.640]  Well, that should be... I mean, they're always a little early on that, so it'll be in 12 seconds, but it'll be a little sooner.
[00:22.800 --> 00:31.720]  Let's see. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[00:35.600 --> 00:36.560]  Wow. Okay.
[00:36.560 --> 00:44.040]  Do you want to just... start? Or...
[00:44.040 --> 00:46.340]  Are we being pranked right now?
[00:54.920 --> 00:56.260]  What's going on?
[00:58.880 --> 01:01.900]  We can't. We can't do a blindside. We need an episode.
[01:03.380 --> 01:05.200]  Is this... Andrew, are you there?
[01:05.720 --> 01:10.100]  Sorry, yeah, I got a call. I was going to jump in when Gavin jumped in to try to...
[01:10.100 --> 01:11.420]  That's what we thought. That's what we thought.
[01:11.760 --> 01:14.420]  But he's not here. FedEx called.
[01:15.100 --> 01:19.060]  I don't know where Gavin is. He's eating some avocado toast. Last I heard.
[01:19.640 --> 01:23.100]  Oh, boy. Look who's barely on time.
[01:23.860 --> 01:24.900]  Oh, fuck. You are on time.
[01:25.360 --> 01:28.920]  My mic wasn't working. Yeah, it's within a minute, right? So does that count?
[01:29.080 --> 01:30.000]  Yeah, you're on time.
[01:30.200 --> 01:33.000]  What did you need the extra 48 seconds for today?
[01:33.400 --> 01:34.000]  I was rebooting.
[01:35.620 --> 01:36.500]  Classic reboot.
[01:37.900 --> 01:38.500]  I was sweating it.
[01:38.920 --> 01:39.140]  Yeah.
[01:39.480 --> 01:42.020]  And I wanted to do a little gag where I would join two seconds later.
[01:42.100 --> 01:44.600]  So Eric could count to 60 and I just blew it.
[01:44.640 --> 01:50.380]  I mean, we were counting because we assumed that Andrew was going to join at the same time you did.
[01:50.500 --> 01:55.520]  And I figured you were going to, like, wait the two seconds and be exactly on time.
[01:55.660 --> 02:00.860]  And then neither of you did that. So we just kind of sat here and went, is this a prank?
[02:00.860 --> 02:03.860]  I got a call from FedEx and we got chips in the mail.
[02:03.980 --> 02:06.580]  So I just, I had to make sure. I had to make sure everything was okay.
[02:06.920 --> 02:08.680]  I can't imagine that was them that fast.
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.720]  Yeah, I don't know. I have no idea what the package is.
[02:11.580 --> 02:12.340]  I hope it is.
[02:13.080 --> 02:17.320]  What an odd begin, what an odd energy to begin this episode with.
[02:17.400 --> 02:18.000]  Oh, I feel great.
[02:18.520 --> 02:19.900]  Hello, your energy elf.
[02:20.740 --> 02:24.920]  Hello, it was just, you weren't on the odd side when we were all there waiting,
[02:25.160 --> 02:27.200]  wondering where Gavin and Andrew were at the same time.
[02:27.400 --> 02:30.020]  And what part of the bit we were in right now.
[02:32.820 --> 02:36.500]  Anyway, hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[02:36.780 --> 02:39.980]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me as always, Andrew Payton and Gavin Free.
[02:40.040 --> 02:44.200]  Decided to go nickname-less today and just go with the OG names.
[02:44.720 --> 02:47.060]  The ones that God and our parents gave us.
[02:47.820 --> 02:51.440]  And then also for me, I guess a judge, because I changed my name.
[02:52.040 --> 02:58.240]  This is episode 160 of volume 2, season 98.
[02:58.300 --> 02:59.380]  He didn't choose it though.
[02:59.380 --> 03:01.960]  No, but he could not let a judge just decide it.
[03:02.060 --> 03:03.100]  Well, first off, it was a she.
[03:04.580 --> 03:06.400]  She allowed me to have the name though.
[03:06.520 --> 03:08.640]  I had to go to her and say, may I please have this name?
[03:08.760 --> 03:10.260]  And then she said, yes.
[03:10.800 --> 03:12.080]  So she granted me the name.
[03:12.280 --> 03:12.720]  I see.
[03:14.060 --> 03:16.380]  I thought you're saying your new nickname is the judge.
[03:16.480 --> 03:17.600]  I was very confused.
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.260]  Has God named anyone?
[03:20.760 --> 03:21.480]  Didn't he?
[03:21.720 --> 03:23.040]  If only there was a painting about it.
[03:23.700 --> 03:26.600]  Yeah, I don't know. I didn't see that part wasn't covered in a fresco.
[03:26.720 --> 03:27.480]  So I don't know.
[03:27.480 --> 03:28.580]  Yeah, I don't.
[03:28.720 --> 03:29.060]  I don't.
[03:29.540 --> 03:30.780]  You're still T-Bone, right?
[03:31.340 --> 03:33.100]  T-Bone's still like it's there.
[03:33.420 --> 03:34.800]  I know you're not using it right now.
[03:35.100 --> 03:36.080]  I'm still T-Bone.
[03:36.200 --> 03:37.220]  I just didn't feel like it.
[03:37.260 --> 03:39.320]  It just didn't feel like a nickname episode.
[03:39.460 --> 03:40.560]  You got to keep the audience guessing.
[03:40.960 --> 03:42.920]  Got to keep you guys guessing, you know.
[03:43.560 --> 03:46.640]  Andrew tried to get us back in sync before this started.
[03:46.740 --> 03:49.440]  He suggested a quick game of Halo right before we started.
[03:49.900 --> 03:51.100]  Did you guys play?
[03:51.500 --> 03:54.840]  No, because I was having breakfast, trying to stuff some breakfast down.
[03:54.840 --> 03:57.640]  So we opted for a little game of Hangman.
[03:58.480 --> 04:00.340]  We both don't know how to play Hangman.
[04:00.620 --> 04:01.220]  What do you mean?
[04:02.200 --> 04:04.400]  I think you're supposed to do a perimeter first.
[04:04.520 --> 04:06.140]  I don't think you're supposed to go straight to the body.
[04:06.840 --> 04:08.040]  No, I was drawing the frame.
[04:08.880 --> 04:10.840]  Oh, I thought that was my body.
[04:10.960 --> 04:11.680]  I thought I was already.
[04:11.960 --> 04:12.700]  Okay, never mind.
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.080]  No, I just misinterpreted.
[04:14.540 --> 04:17.540]  I immediately thought it was Wurtle is how I played it.
[04:17.820 --> 04:20.400]  Gavin laid out the blank spots and I said shrimp.
[04:20.700 --> 04:21.880]  And then there was confusion.
[04:21.880 --> 04:23.340]  But we got there.
[04:25.460 --> 04:26.860]  So who won Hangman?
[04:27.780 --> 04:30.040]  He guessed it right. It was Crispz.
[04:30.900 --> 04:34.760]  You know, I don't even view Hangman as a winner. I feel like it's a collaborative effort.
[04:35.040 --> 04:36.380]  I feel like you either win or lose together.
[04:36.640 --> 04:39.600]  If you get your body drawn hanging by the neck, you've lost, I think.
[04:40.040 --> 04:40.880]  Yeah, but...
[04:41.500 --> 04:44.560]  I don't know. I view that as our body. I don't view it...
[04:44.560 --> 04:46.180]  I feel like you want me to win.
[04:47.920 --> 04:50.000]  Our body? I'm hanging us?
[04:50.000 --> 04:50.620]  Yeah.
[04:53.200 --> 04:54.080]  You were.
[04:56.340 --> 04:59.300]  Gavin, do you remember when we used to work at Achievement Hunter?
[04:59.680 --> 05:06.880]  And we did those hardcore shows, like Hardcore Monopoly, where we played Monopoly with real money.
[05:07.480 --> 05:12.560]  Do you think anybody's ever played Hardcore Hangman, where it's just two dudes in nooses?
[05:13.180 --> 05:16.480]  Yeah, well, according to Andrew, it would be a tandem noose.
[05:16.600 --> 05:17.880]  We would just both be through it.
[05:17.880 --> 05:18.060]  Yeah.
[05:18.540 --> 05:19.880]  To save money, I guess.
[05:20.280 --> 05:21.640]  Yeah. Oh, absolutely.
[05:22.160 --> 05:26.940]  It was really fucked up that you did that to us, but I'm glad that, you know, I was able to figure out the word and we're okay.
[05:27.420 --> 05:31.920]  Do you think that would be one loop and both of our heads are through it, or would it be like one rope with two loops?
[05:32.080 --> 05:34.120]  I think one rope, two loops. For sure.
[05:34.340 --> 05:34.660]  Okay. Yeah.
[05:35.100 --> 05:36.440]  I wonder if that exists.
[05:36.740 --> 05:41.820]  First of all, you think my head is gonna fit through a loop with your head? There's no way. My head needs its own loop.
[05:44.660 --> 05:45.900]  It needs a separate attachment.
[05:46.780 --> 05:50.640]  Oh, I think I've got a better chance of surviving if I get hanged with you.
[05:51.760 --> 05:53.740]  Oh, yeah, for sure. Absolutely.
[05:55.060 --> 05:56.280]  Why do you think that?
[05:56.380 --> 05:59.400]  I don't know. I just feel like the physics of it probably wouldn't work out for the rope.
[06:00.040 --> 06:01.700]  So you think you'd live?
[06:02.920 --> 06:08.620]  Oh, maybe. Although I think there's a lot to it. You've got to get the weight right when it comes to hanging people and the distance.
[06:08.920 --> 06:14.640]  I think it's technically considered not very humane if your head comes off.
[06:14.640 --> 06:16.880]  I think it's technically considered not very humane.
[06:17.200 --> 06:21.700]  If the rope breaks, do they have to let you go?
[06:23.460 --> 06:29.920]  Isn't there like a three strikes rule where if it fails three times, they're just like, ah, you were destined for the future?
[06:30.320 --> 06:33.620]  You think there's a three strikes rule with hanging?
[06:34.100 --> 06:34.880]  I think so.
[06:35.820 --> 06:39.220]  Oh, shit, man, the rope broke. Let's try it. Let's try it one more time.
[06:39.300 --> 06:41.280]  But you better be sure. Oh, broke again.
[06:41.480 --> 06:45.860]  This is the last chance we have to fucking kill this guy.
[06:46.600 --> 06:49.280]  It's like you get to a firing squad and the gun jams.
[06:49.380 --> 06:51.200]  They're like, I guess you can go home.
[06:52.320 --> 06:53.780]  I only brought one bullet.
[06:54.400 --> 06:59.740]  I think if the if the rope is too long and you just land on the ground, you should be able to walk away.
[07:02.760 --> 07:04.320]  We got a new hangman.
[07:04.960 --> 07:07.000]  So let me let me posit this.
[07:07.480 --> 07:08.880]  What if it is?
[07:10.860 --> 07:14.740]  Two nooses on either side of one rope.
[07:15.360 --> 07:16.580]  What's the plural of noose?
[07:17.260 --> 07:19.740]  Noose-eye? Noose-piece?
[07:20.760 --> 07:23.100]  Like, what if I guess it would be kind of like this?
[07:23.540 --> 07:24.780]  And then you just sort of like...
[07:25.660 --> 07:26.800]  Oh, it's like a tug of war.
[07:27.140 --> 07:28.060]  Yeah, that looks fun.
[07:28.060 --> 07:29.360]  OK, so what if?
[07:29.580 --> 07:34.100]  Yeah, what if it's at ground level and you just have to run in opposite directions and whoever dies first loses?
[07:36.340 --> 07:39.400]  You think it would like tighten as you ran the other way?
[07:39.520 --> 07:40.180]  Like it would tighten on the other side?
[07:40.200 --> 07:41.300]  Absolutely, it would tighten.
[07:42.260 --> 07:45.040]  I don't know how you would tighten the other person's without tightening yours.
[07:45.840 --> 07:47.960]  That's the thing.
[07:48.160 --> 07:49.700]  The tougher dude wins, I guess.
[07:50.280 --> 07:51.300]  The tougher neck wins.
[07:51.540 --> 07:53.260]  Is that who you want to live?
[07:53.960 --> 07:54.360]  Tough neck?
[07:54.980 --> 07:56.160]  Yeah, you want tough neck.
[07:56.820 --> 07:59.540]  Yeah, this just sounds like hardcore tug of war, to be honest.
[07:59.900 --> 08:00.220]  Yeah.
[08:02.160 --> 08:03.800]  It's exactly what it is.
[08:05.100 --> 08:06.180]  This is stupid.
[08:07.020 --> 08:14.080]  I mean, what's going to happen there? If the rope's long, two people are going to go full tilt in either direction and both people's necks will break.
[08:14.820 --> 08:19.460]  How long is the rope? Is it hundreds of yards of rope? Is it just the length of the rope?
[08:20.660 --> 08:22.660]  A hundred meters of rope.
[08:25.240 --> 08:28.260]  That'd be the most terrifying sprint of your life.
[08:28.480 --> 08:37.620]  There's something really funny about the idea of like a summer intern executioner constantly fucking things up, not tying the knots right, ordering too long of rope.
[08:38.880 --> 08:45.540]  What would your strategy be if you had a hundred yards of rope attached to your neck and then somebody else's neck on the other end?
[08:46.040 --> 08:47.760]  I'd just be chasing the other person, I think.
[08:48.220 --> 08:49.500]  Just try to stay up with them?
[08:49.680 --> 08:55.820]  Yeah, just try to keep the slack there and eventually try and catch up to them and maybe hook a bit of slack around their neck and just hang them manually.
[08:56.340 --> 09:07.940]  I think I would run to a stop sign and then I would wind myself around the stop sign to protect myself and then hope they don't notice and see if they just accidentally hang themselves trying to pull me.
[09:07.940 --> 09:18.440]  So from like a driver's bystander perspective, they're like stopping at the stop sign, they see someone running with a rope around the neck, running around the stop sign.
[09:18.800 --> 09:20.600]  Like a human tetherball, yeah.
[09:21.060 --> 09:27.220]  And then suddenly the rope goes taut and then they go flying and pull out the stop sign. That's probably what they're gonna see.
[09:28.800 --> 09:33.980]  How hard is this person pulling? They're gonna pull a stop sign out of the ground? That shit's in there with concrete!
[09:34.400 --> 09:36.740]  You don't know what the other person's done, he might have gone and...
[09:37.940 --> 09:41.080]  picked up a couple of dumbbells and jumped out of a window, you don't know what he's done.
[09:44.460 --> 09:45.940]  You think dumbbells would do it?
[09:47.580 --> 09:50.660]  Oh, what if you like hopped on somebody's car, like the hood of their car?
[09:50.680 --> 09:52.420]  Yeah, what if you hop on a city bus?
[09:54.200 --> 10:02.140]  It's almost like, it's the same idea of like pulling your tooth out by like tying like a rope around it, but it's just escalated to the highest level.
[10:02.600 --> 10:04.000]  But you're pulling someone's neck out.
[10:06.160 --> 10:12.040]  I feel like if it was you and I, Gavin, I would just, we would, I'd have to, that's how our life now. That's just how we live.
[10:12.540 --> 10:15.140]  I would be a hundred yards away from every slo-mo shoot.
[10:17.320 --> 10:18.560]  In the woods somewhere.
[10:19.460 --> 10:31.520]  How long, how long do you think, like, let's say we did this as an experiment. How long do you think you guys could peacefully coexist before one of you accidentally kills the other?
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.860]  Uh, I think until the first night of sleep. And then Andrew would have a dream about trials and lurch upright and hang me.
[10:39.240 --> 10:42.160]  Yeah, but no, no, no, you'd be fine because you could tuck him in finally.
[10:42.400 --> 10:43.360]  Oh, and then he wouldn't be able to go anywhere.
[10:44.480 --> 10:47.220]  You could walk, you'd watch over him like you want to do.
[10:47.500 --> 10:50.180]  Or maybe he could be in the bathroom and I could be in the bed and it'd just be pretty peaceful.
[10:50.180 --> 10:52.440]  No, I don't want to be in the bath. I want to be in the bed.
[10:53.160 --> 10:54.000]  Stop going in there then.
[10:54.000 --> 11:01.400]  Well, I feel like I poorly explained. I was in the bath sleeping because it's literally the only place I could sleep with my lungs.
[11:01.720 --> 11:04.200]  I couldn't, there's nowhere else that I could sit upright.
[11:04.740 --> 11:07.340]  It was like, it was like a means to an end for you.
[11:07.520 --> 11:12.860]  Like, yeah, it wasn't, I wasn't, I've never chosen the bath as my preferred destination for sleeping.
[11:13.740 --> 11:16.320]  It was just literally the only place I could get sleep.
[11:17.080 --> 11:20.800]  I mean, for someone who sleeps in the bath as much as you, that's a crazy sentence.
[11:20.800 --> 11:24.720]  But I don't, I don't, it's not a regular occurrence.
[11:25.240 --> 11:31.720]  Sometimes I, I'm not on purpose. Sometimes, you know, you just, it happens, but that's never the goal.
[11:32.040 --> 11:34.160]  Is that audio recording content that you sent me?
[11:34.420 --> 11:38.480]  I don't know. Is it? My lungs? Are we talking about my lungs?
[11:38.640 --> 11:41.460]  That was fucking brutal, dude. Gavin played it for me.
[11:41.880 --> 11:47.320]  Oh yeah. I don't, I like, look, I'm all for putting everything out that people want to hear and everything.
[11:47.420 --> 11:50.020]  And this is just going to create a fervor for people that want to hear.
[11:50.020 --> 11:56.360]  I don't think anybody should hear that. Like, I really, truly don't think, like, I've thought about it many times since I heard it.
[11:56.420 --> 11:58.560]  And it has made me go, I wish I never heard that.
[11:58.700 --> 12:00.280]  Were you awake or asleep?
[12:01.420 --> 12:02.940]  I was, what do you mean? When that was recorded?
[12:03.240 --> 12:05.160]  Yeah. I was awake. I recorded it.
[12:05.420 --> 12:06.880]  Okay. That was just me trying to exhale.
[12:07.200 --> 12:13.100]  Dude, my lungs sounded like Chernobyl, like with the radiation counter, like the, the, just how crackly it was.
[12:13.520 --> 12:15.520]  It sounded like Zoltar changing a tire.
[12:18.300 --> 12:23.080]  That's how I would equate it to it. If we, if we're not going to play it, that's what it sounded like.
[12:24.600 --> 12:25.400]  Oh man.
[12:30.240 --> 12:32.700]  Zoltar changing a tire is such a great visual.
[12:36.620 --> 12:37.580]  So how are the lungs?
[12:38.440 --> 12:42.500]  Uh, not, I mean, better, getting better. Not as bad as they were.
[12:43.020 --> 12:44.060]  You're in the bed now, right?
[12:44.660 --> 12:46.240]  Uh, yeah. Yeah, I am.
[12:46.380 --> 12:47.240]  Okay. Okay, good.
[12:47.340 --> 12:49.420]  For the most part. For the most part.
[12:49.800 --> 12:51.720]  Does that mean you're still sleeping in the bathtub sometimes?
[12:52.180 --> 12:57.220]  Uh, if I really need to, yeah, but mostly I've been able to, like, I'm kind of on the end of it now.
[12:57.300 --> 13:01.440]  It sucks. I got like pneumonia or like bronchitis on the tail end of having COVID.
[13:01.740 --> 13:05.860]  So it was, I was feeling better. And then honestly, it may have been your fault, Gavin.
[13:06.080 --> 13:11.680]  I was trying to track like what happened and you killed me with the cheese roll question.
[13:11.680 --> 13:16.040]  And I wondered if laughing that hard somehow opened myself up.
[13:16.720 --> 13:17.860]  I was feeling better.
[13:18.200 --> 13:20.360]  It just gave you tuberculosis or something?
[13:20.500 --> 13:21.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[13:21.700 --> 13:23.200]  It was a consumption laugh.
[13:23.660 --> 13:26.580]  It was. But, uh, we're improving.
[13:27.280 --> 13:28.680]  Oh, I'm glad.
[13:29.080 --> 13:31.100]  Because that audio clip was awful.
[13:31.860 --> 13:34.640]  Oh, it was not good. Imagine that's your life. That's just how I was living.
[13:34.880 --> 13:36.780]  That we're not putting in. Decidedly.
[13:37.280 --> 13:38.920]  No, I think it's not funny.
[13:39.680 --> 13:40.580]  No, it's not funny.
[13:40.580 --> 13:43.540]  I never even considered his content. I thought that was a weird question.
[13:43.720 --> 13:45.440]  It's a funny podcast. That's not funny.
[13:45.800 --> 13:47.980]  I mean, you said that we open with suicide.
[13:48.640 --> 13:49.640]  That's how we started.
[13:50.120 --> 13:52.060]  Well, being hanged isn't suicide.
[13:53.380 --> 13:53.820]  Well...
[13:55.080 --> 13:56.920]  It very often is, Gavin.
[13:57.900 --> 14:03.020]  But going up to the gallows is not usually how people do it, I don't think.
[14:03.060 --> 14:07.260]  Right. No, but I viewed it as you putting us in that situation with hangman.
[14:07.540 --> 14:09.900]  You put us into the high stakes of solving the work.
[14:09.900 --> 14:12.500]  I just think I don't think. Yeah. All right.
[14:12.600 --> 14:15.740]  Can we talk about something else that's terrible that isn't related to us?
[14:15.880 --> 14:17.600]  Give you a quick pivot. I've been doing some research.
[14:17.800 --> 14:23.140]  I'm not done with my research, but we we got blindsided by you, Geoff.
[14:23.320 --> 14:30.020]  And we watched a episode of Mr. Belvedere in which Danny gets AIDS and has to deal with that.
[14:30.640 --> 14:34.500]  Well, he doesn't get AIDS in the episode. He already has it when the episode starts.
[14:34.500 --> 14:37.000]  He gets diagnosed with AIDS within the episode.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.960]  Or at least we as the viewer learn about his diagnosis.
[14:39.960 --> 14:41.960]  We're introduced to his diagnosis. Yes.
[14:42.440 --> 14:49.540]  So I was curious as looking at that person's IMDb and I wondered if that is the worst thing that has happened to them as a character.
[14:49.920 --> 14:56.100]  Because their career is generally one off episodes of sitcoms from that time.
[14:56.180 --> 15:01.460]  So I've been going through and I've been watching every appearance they have made in order.
[15:02.160 --> 15:04.680]  I'm still I'm only about halfway through.
[15:04.680 --> 15:09.860]  Let me tell you, let me they started in Chips as the first role they ever had was in Chips.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.060]  They played a small child, I believe was the role.
[15:13.580 --> 15:15.000]  You don't even see their face.
[15:15.080 --> 15:22.140]  The only thing that happens to them is they get run over by a bicycle in a park by a thief trying to escape.
[15:22.540 --> 15:24.400]  That's how they started. And they're ballooned.
[15:24.420 --> 15:26.000]  They let go of their balloon and they cry.
[15:26.440 --> 15:31.100]  The Sean Bean of kid actors.
[15:31.440 --> 15:34.660]  Yeah, this is like he's like the Star Trek red shirt of sitcoms.
[15:34.660 --> 15:37.500]  Yeah. So that was how how they opened.
[15:37.840 --> 15:40.760]  The next thing I watched was Cagney and Lacey.
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.920]  They had an OK. Thankfully, thankfully, nothing bad happened to them.
[15:47.260 --> 15:50.740]  However, they did witness their friend get abducted.
[15:51.100 --> 15:54.400]  They were a key witness in an abduction of their friend.
[15:55.220 --> 15:57.680]  Next thing I watched was Alice.
[15:58.060 --> 16:03.440]  I don't really know what happened in Alice because I can only find an Italian version of the episode online.
[16:04.100 --> 16:08.100]  And I had to use YouTube translate something about tortoises.
[16:08.180 --> 16:09.440]  I think everything was OK.
[16:09.640 --> 16:13.740]  I think he was just like living in the building, having a good time talking about turtles.
[16:14.120 --> 16:17.340]  How did you not blindside us with the Italian version of Alice?
[16:17.580 --> 16:19.520]  We're not allowed to do a blindside apparently.
[16:19.660 --> 16:22.500]  How the fuck is Alice subtitled into Italian?
[16:22.720 --> 16:24.860]  Why did why did Italy ever want that?
[16:25.320 --> 16:26.700]  It was. Yeah, I don't know.
[16:26.800 --> 16:28.660]  It was it was all in. Is it dubbed?
[16:28.700 --> 16:31.160]  Yeah, it was a dubbed Italian version of it.
[16:31.160 --> 16:35.620]  And I had to watch YouTube generated subtitles, which I do not fully trust.
[16:36.040 --> 16:37.820]  They kept talking about tortoises randomly.
[16:40.380 --> 16:42.160]  Then they were in a V.
[16:42.380 --> 16:43.120]  They're an episode of V.
[16:43.160 --> 16:47.160]  I wasn't able. I haven't watched that yet, but I ended it with Silver Spoons.
[16:47.480 --> 16:50.280]  I guarantee you the V episode probably didn't go well for the kid.
[16:50.440 --> 16:53.780]  If you know that show at all, it's about lizard aliens that want to eat us.
[16:54.180 --> 16:57.600]  Yeah. So I need to see that because I assume something terrible happened.
[16:57.960 --> 16:59.540]  But they were also on Silver Spoons.
[16:59.540 --> 17:03.260]  Once again, they're kind of a Dennis the Menace type character in that one.
[17:03.320 --> 17:05.080]  They're having a good time. Everything's fun and all good.
[17:05.240 --> 17:07.800]  But they witnessed another child abduction.
[17:08.420 --> 17:09.600]  They are. Oh, God.
[17:09.660 --> 17:12.040]  They're with another group of kids that one of them is abducted.
[17:12.060 --> 17:13.760]  So not great.
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.300]  Is that everything they that is that like their entire body of work?
[17:17.660 --> 17:19.560]  No, they're I'm about halfway through.
[17:19.660 --> 17:23.600]  They have a few like they have a four episode run in General Hospital.
[17:24.380 --> 17:27.720]  There's probably like five or six other appearances that I know.
[17:27.720 --> 17:32.820]  I don't I have no before we watch that episode of Mr. Belvedere.
[17:32.920 --> 17:34.000]  I had no idea who that kid was.
[17:34.060 --> 17:36.460]  I still don't. I can't even picture him in my mind right now.
[17:36.680 --> 17:42.140]  But that kid managed to be in every great show in the 80s.
[17:42.200 --> 17:44.760]  Like if you tell me that kid was in Dukes of Hazzard or the A-Team,
[17:45.240 --> 17:47.380]  they should build a fucking monument to the kid.
[17:47.860 --> 17:49.480]  God damn. What a life.
[17:50.320 --> 17:51.000]  It's quite the run.
[17:51.700 --> 17:54.680]  It's been fun seeing like sitcoms that I'm aware of,
[17:54.680 --> 17:56.000]  but have never watched before.
[17:56.140 --> 17:58.460]  And the fucking theme songs are crazy.
[17:58.680 --> 18:01.980]  They really they went all in at that time on what a theme song should be.
[18:02.080 --> 18:04.620]  The 80s cared about the theme song.
[18:04.920 --> 18:05.560]  They really did it.
[18:05.680 --> 18:09.940]  It was it was it was it was like they were all about making a great first impression.
[18:10.220 --> 18:11.160]  And they did it very well.
[18:11.460 --> 18:13.920]  So that has been my update.
[18:14.160 --> 18:15.980]  That is not a terrible news for them, not us.
[18:17.100 --> 18:20.380]  I'm glad you've gone the extra mile and researched this kid.
[18:20.720 --> 18:22.080]  I'm in awe of this kid.
[18:22.120 --> 18:23.120]  What's the actor's name again?
[18:23.120 --> 18:25.120]  I believe in.
[18:25.900 --> 18:27.720]  Well, it's the they transgendered.
[18:27.760 --> 18:31.000]  So they go by Ena fried now, but they were fried at the time.
[18:31.220 --> 18:32.260]  OK, got it.
[18:32.720 --> 18:33.520]  Dang, man.
[18:34.380 --> 18:38.080]  Yeah, they're actually like a really big tech journalist from what I could tell now.
[18:38.280 --> 18:43.460]  Like they have had a substantial career post that and my brief research of them.
[18:44.140 --> 18:45.240]  What an interesting life.
[18:45.540 --> 18:47.500]  I bet they've got tons of crazy stories.
[18:47.740 --> 18:48.640]  Oh, I imagine so.
[18:48.960 --> 18:52.260]  I was expecting it was going to be sort of like trying to find somebody from MVP, too,
[18:52.260 --> 18:55.120]  or whatever, or it's just, you know, there's no digital footprint.
[18:55.760 --> 18:56.920]  I'd love to talk to him.
[18:57.900 --> 18:58.000]  Yeah.
[18:58.960 --> 19:00.580]  Tell me that you can be honest with me.
[19:00.660 --> 19:02.000]  Ricky Schroeder was a prick, right?
[19:02.400 --> 19:03.120]  He looked like a prick.
[19:05.220 --> 19:08.080]  Was Silver Spoons was like, is it just he's a rich kid?
[19:08.140 --> 19:09.240]  Is that the whole premise of that show?
[19:09.360 --> 19:09.720]  Yeah.
[19:09.840 --> 19:10.120]  Yeah.
[19:10.240 --> 19:14.980]  He's a rich kid and he's got a race car bed and his dad's really cool.
[19:15.160 --> 19:17.560]  And then he's got like his mom's dead maybe.
[19:17.560 --> 19:23.660]  And his dad has like an assistant or like a co-worker or maybe a girlfriend who's really cool.
[19:23.760 --> 19:24.660]  I think it was Aaron Gray.
[19:26.900 --> 19:30.860]  And and then he just like he just like is a teenager that has issues.
[19:31.440 --> 19:31.880]  Right.
[19:32.740 --> 19:34.300]  Eric just posted a description.
[19:34.600 --> 19:35.120]  Oh, it is.
[19:35.220 --> 19:42.280]  Ricky Stratton is a spoiled rich kid who lives the life that many kids dream of, but he still suffers from the problems that many teens do.
[19:42.700 --> 19:43.040]  Yeah.
[19:43.520 --> 19:46.720]  The tone of that is such of like rich people also have problems.
[19:46.720 --> 19:50.540]  I remember. Well, that was what the 80s was all about, right? Rich people also have problems.
[19:51.260 --> 19:57.460]  Uh, I, uh, I remember an episode where he got he broke he got broken up with by the girl he was in love with.
[19:57.720 --> 20:01.040]  And they played that song Broken Wings, you know, take these broken wings.
[20:01.220 --> 20:02.820]  And he was it was like fucking intense.
[20:03.340 --> 20:04.460]  I felt really bad for him.
[20:04.980 --> 20:05.760]  It was really depressing.
[20:06.100 --> 20:06.240]  Yeah.
[20:06.620 --> 20:14.100]  I think that show shows how TV has changed so much where that was the thing that you wanted to see was somebody be written.
[20:14.240 --> 20:15.280]  It was like the early 2000s.
[20:15.420 --> 20:15.640]  Yes.
[20:15.640 --> 20:16.160]  Yeah.
[20:16.480 --> 20:19.060]  That continued through this is like, look at these rich people.
[20:19.260 --> 20:22.180]  And like, they're just like, there's rich and there's money and all this stuff.
[20:22.220 --> 20:23.760]  And now you're just like these fucking people.
[20:23.780 --> 20:24.560]  That's such a great point.
[20:24.620 --> 20:29.620]  Yeah. But isn't that why stuff like like Fresh Prince worked because because Will wasn't from that environment.
[20:29.640 --> 20:31.040]  Like he was like the audience.
[20:31.220 --> 20:33.280]  Yes, exactly. Exactly.
[20:33.620 --> 20:36.180]  That's why Brewster's Millions was such a success too.
[20:36.280 --> 20:37.320]  Same kind of thing.
[20:37.320 --> 20:48.560]  I bet you there's an interesting transition point of like Silver Spoons to Fresh Prince to like Malcolm in the Middle, which is for me like what I view is like a sitcom growing up where it's just poor people, very poor people.
[20:48.920 --> 20:50.760]  But but they had that with like Roseanne.
[20:51.140 --> 20:51.640]  That's true.
[20:51.960 --> 20:53.240]  And it didn't get much poorer.
[20:53.640 --> 20:58.040]  I think the Roseanne, the Connors were way poorer than the Malcolm in the Middle family.
[20:58.080 --> 21:00.700]  I think they were like, really, they were struggling.
[21:00.820 --> 21:02.020]  It was a big part of the show, right?
[21:02.040 --> 21:03.040]  They were struggling constantly.
[21:03.540 --> 21:03.720]  Yeah.
[21:03.860 --> 21:05.480]  And still finding the humor in life.
[21:05.760 --> 21:06.000]  Yep.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.060]  It's such a shame that Roseanne Barr turned out to be wacky because that is such a good fucking show.
[21:11.360 --> 21:13.920]  I still, if I see it on, I'll still catch like an old episode.
[21:14.460 --> 21:15.120]  I'll still watch it.
[21:15.160 --> 21:16.200]  And it still holds up.
[21:16.240 --> 21:19.380]  It's one of those shows that like is always going to be good.
[21:19.580 --> 21:20.400]  Always going to be funny.
[21:20.860 --> 21:23.640]  Do you remember when she sang the National Anthem?
[21:24.060 --> 21:28.740]  I was always surprised that someone with those political views would shit all over the National Anthem.
[21:29.300 --> 21:31.280]  Like, is it not the crazy?
[21:31.400 --> 21:32.180]  Andrew, do you know about this?
[21:32.400 --> 21:32.660]  No.
[21:33.560 --> 21:33.960]  Really?
[21:34.740 --> 21:35.280]  I have no idea.
[21:35.280 --> 21:38.740]  You're a sports guy and you don't, and you haven't seen this?
[21:38.840 --> 21:43.540]  I feel like Roseanne Barr is just a whole from, like I have zero point of reference really for anything.
[21:43.700 --> 21:44.040]  Wow.
[21:44.240 --> 21:44.560]  Okay.
[21:44.780 --> 21:51.720]  I mean, don't feel like you got to watch the whole thing right now, but you can just skip in about 15 seconds to the start of it.
[21:51.820 --> 21:55.420]  And this was in San Diego when this happened.
[21:55.480 --> 21:58.120]  So it was all over the news constantly.
[21:58.180 --> 22:01.000]  I remember like growing up and this was like the craziest.
[22:01.400 --> 22:02.140]  Oh, it was so bad.
[22:05.840 --> 22:08.020]  It was that how you got canceled back then?
[22:08.880 --> 22:14.280]  Well, I mean, like, no, because she just kept, it's not like it, it's not like it ended her.
[22:14.540 --> 22:15.300]  Oh, it didn't?
[22:15.400 --> 22:17.280]  No, it was a lot of controversy.
[22:17.620 --> 22:21.860]  It, it didn't do her any favors, but she kept going.
[22:23.080 --> 22:24.740]  There was no canceling back then.
[22:24.860 --> 22:25.160]  No.
[22:25.300 --> 22:25.680]  Okay.
[22:25.680 --> 22:33.400]  Let me ask Geoff, if maybe, you know, is that, is it better or worse than Carl Lewis's National Anthem?
[22:40.910 --> 22:43.210]  I was thinking about this the other day.
[22:43.270 --> 22:45.070]  I can't, I can't answer that.
[22:45.470 --> 22:46.030]  What was that one?
[22:47.210 --> 22:51.190]  It is, it's stunning.
[22:51.430 --> 22:54.430]  Like people are booing Roseanne at Roseanne's.
[22:54.430 --> 23:01.730]  Carl Lewis sings this and it is the basketball players like laughing at him openly.
[23:02.170 --> 23:06.650]  It's, it's so, it's so.
[23:06.850 --> 23:08.030]  Does he just botch it?
[23:08.230 --> 23:12.550]  Oh, it's so, it's just the workers.
[23:12.950 --> 23:13.430]  Oh man.
[23:13.870 --> 23:16.210]  Oh, I forgot about that.
[23:16.310 --> 23:17.090]  I forgot this existed.
[23:17.670 --> 23:18.950]  Oh, it's so brutal.
[23:21.070 --> 23:22.770]  Oh, it's so good.
[23:22.770 --> 23:25.410]  I think Carl Lewis's is more entertaining.
[23:25.630 --> 23:26.610]  Oh, definitely.
[23:27.130 --> 23:27.690]  God.
[23:29.190 --> 23:32.110]  Should we, should we take both those clips and make them duet?
[23:33.250 --> 23:33.810]  No.
[23:37.530 --> 23:40.870]  That was something I was talking, talking to Andrew about recently.
[23:40.970 --> 23:49.210]  It's just, I find it so strange that in non-international games, the American National Anthem is still sang at all games.
[23:50.410 --> 23:50.970]  What?
[23:51.110 --> 23:51.410]  Really?
[23:52.450 --> 23:53.210]  Is it really?
[23:54.450 --> 23:59.010]  Well, like it's like, like two basketball teams from America will sing the National Anthem before they start.
[23:59.410 --> 23:59.830]  Yeah.
[24:00.690 --> 24:01.110]  Wait.
[24:01.170 --> 24:02.530]  Like that's weird to me.
[24:02.690 --> 24:02.910]  Dude.
[24:03.210 --> 24:04.690]  Wait, what are you saying exactly?
[24:04.910 --> 24:06.550]  I think I don't follow exactly what you're saying.
[24:06.610 --> 24:08.050]  It's for other countries.
[24:08.250 --> 24:11.190]  It's like if you play an international game, both countries will sing the National Anthem.
[24:11.630 --> 24:12.830]  You're singing it to yourselves.
[24:13.610 --> 24:15.230]  I like that it's such a culture shock.
[24:15.310 --> 24:21.030]  Like the idea is that the anthem is supposed to be like a welcome to our country is how he is viewing it.
[24:21.030 --> 24:21.190]  Yeah.
[24:21.230 --> 24:27.850]  Like if a Premier League game like Tottenham versus Arsenal, they sang the British National Anthem.
[24:27.970 --> 24:29.310]  You'd be like, wait, who's here?
[24:29.490 --> 24:29.610]  What?
[24:29.950 --> 24:30.430]  Who's this for?
[24:30.450 --> 24:31.970]  See, it's just a different culture.
[24:32.190 --> 24:35.330]  In America, there is this thing called national pride.
[24:35.630 --> 24:45.070]  I don't know that it exists in the UK, but where most people are, even in the turmoil, political turmoil of our country right now,
[24:45.070 --> 24:52.330]  and the division between the Democrats and the Republicans, people are proud to be from here.
[24:52.630 --> 24:59.850]  And it's considered like a showing of esprit de corps and unity to do the National Anthem.
[25:00.110 --> 25:01.670]  It's even worse in the army.
[25:02.050 --> 25:03.610]  If it gets everyone all together, then I guess it works.
[25:04.050 --> 25:05.310]  Let me pose this.
[25:05.750 --> 25:11.790]  Gavin, when you hear your National Anthem, you hear it's typically in an international setting or whatever.
[25:11.930 --> 25:14.210]  Yeah, I'm going to hear that and I'm going to hear the Italian one or something.
[25:14.210 --> 25:17.130]  So, do you feel pride for that National Anthem?
[25:17.230 --> 25:20.470]  Like, when you hear it, are you like, you know, like you feel something for it?
[25:21.070 --> 25:22.750]  I mean, I relate to it, I guess.
[25:22.970 --> 25:24.330]  It's not a very good song, though.
[25:25.410 --> 25:26.450]  I'm a bit drab.
[25:26.850 --> 25:31.930]  Imagine hearing it so many times in your life that it means literally nothing to you.
[25:32.890 --> 25:33.510]  That's true.
[25:33.910 --> 25:35.610]  That is where I'm at with it.
[25:35.990 --> 25:39.430]  Yeah, for me, it's definitely like, oh, something of note is happening, probably.
[25:39.690 --> 25:41.630]  Like, I should look around and see what's going on.
[25:42.710 --> 25:44.050]  I guess I'm an outlier.
[25:44.230 --> 25:44.570]  I like it.
[25:44.870 --> 25:46.070]  It doesn't bother me at all.
[25:46.370 --> 25:48.890]  I will say the Army goes too far with it.
[25:49.130 --> 25:52.850]  Like, there are movie theaters on Army bases, you know, for soldiers to go to the movies.
[25:52.850 --> 25:57.010]  Just like, you know, other normal person off base.
[25:57.390 --> 25:59.890]  And they play the fucking National Anthem before the movies.
[26:00.030 --> 26:03.030]  And you got to stand up and salute or like put your hand on your heart and shit.
[26:03.290 --> 26:06.190]  And it's like, it's just, I'm just seeing Tommy boy.
[26:06.430 --> 26:07.190]  It's not even new.
[26:07.330 --> 26:08.330]  It's not even a new release.
[26:09.130 --> 26:14.310]  It's just a dollar theater, you know, but you still got to like, that's where I'm like, all right, let's calm down.
[26:14.630 --> 26:22.830]  Is the National Anthem more for the people that live in the country or for the people that are visiting the country as like an introductory?
[26:23.310 --> 26:28.690]  I always assumed it was like a brief presentation for the visiting or for the, you know, the other country.
[26:28.970 --> 26:34.530]  I'm just imagining like getting arrested in a foreign country and using the, I didn't hear the National Anthem as a defense.
[26:34.650 --> 26:35.970]  I didn't, I didn't know how the rules work.
[26:35.970 --> 26:37.850]  I didn't get the vibe of this place.
[26:38.330 --> 26:41.070]  Some countries have absolutely banger National Anthems.
[26:41.390 --> 26:45.930]  And I feel like the US and the UK don't qualify.
[26:46.370 --> 26:48.330]  Yeah, I don't, I don't feel great about Canada.
[26:48.950 --> 26:50.670]  Uh, yeah, I would.
[26:51.070 --> 26:53.370]  Canada is probably the most boring one to me.
[26:53.450 --> 26:53.890]  No offense.
[26:54.170 --> 27:01.690]  I would put England would be least boring than America, than Canada in terms of our three countries.
[27:01.910 --> 27:02.570]  Oh, wow.
[27:03.110 --> 27:05.130]  Yeah, I can't necessarily argue that.
[27:05.130 --> 27:08.570]  Although I feel like America has like three anthems, don't they?
[27:08.950 --> 27:11.530]  Yeah, we got a song for everything.
[27:12.730 --> 27:14.090]  I feel like there's a lot of anthems.
[27:15.190 --> 27:18.410]  I feel like I hear you guys singing about different things at different times.
[27:18.530 --> 27:20.210]  And it's, I get caught off guard occasionally.
[27:21.010 --> 27:21.770]  What do you mean?
[27:22.350 --> 27:26.270]  Well, there's the star, I feel like there's the Star Spangled Banner one.
[27:26.730 --> 27:27.910]  And that's the National Anthem, right?
[27:28.350 --> 27:31.630]  Yeah, but then I feel like I sometimes hear them singing a different song.
[27:32.250 --> 27:33.130]  America the Beautiful.
[27:34.450 --> 27:35.410]  Yeah, that.
[27:36.930 --> 27:39.890]  Lee Greenwood sang a song and now we got to hear that forever.
[27:40.730 --> 27:41.530]  God bless America.
[27:42.270 --> 27:48.230]  Did you see that someone shat all over your theory of being born in the middle of the decade?
[27:48.590 --> 27:49.790]  Oh, yeah, I did see that.
[27:50.170 --> 27:54.150]  And I actually saw a lot of people, surprisingly, coming to your defense.
[27:54.330 --> 28:00.730]  So someone pointed out that being born in the middle of 1975 is not the middle of the decade.
[28:01.250 --> 28:05.790]  Technically, the middle of the decade is midnight on the 31st of December 1974.
[28:06.910 --> 28:11.990]  But a lot of people, and I never see this on the internet, a lot of people chimed in and were like, just let him have it, man.
[28:12.130 --> 28:14.530]  Yeah, no, I agree. Just let me have it.
[28:14.910 --> 28:16.770]  It's the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle.
[28:16.890 --> 28:25.090]  I understand that it's not like the mathematical middle, but it's like, but there's a narrative to how middle it is that I think is fun.
[28:25.550 --> 28:26.750]  I just found that so funny.
[28:27.010 --> 28:28.310]  Yeah, I thought it was pretty funny too.
[28:28.310 --> 28:30.590]  I want to listen to every country song now.
[28:30.930 --> 28:32.550]  I'm going to look into that.
[28:32.710 --> 28:34.890]  I want to because I did every state song.
[28:35.110 --> 28:36.690]  There's some bangers in there.
[28:37.030 --> 28:40.550]  That's what God, I couldn't remember for the life of me what it is you did.
[28:40.630 --> 28:41.570]  You just said, I want to do that.
[28:41.590 --> 28:43.410]  And I went, God, I swear he did this.
[28:43.590 --> 28:44.750]  I did the state songs.
[28:44.930 --> 28:52.470]  My favorite one, I think, is Rhode Island song, because Rhode Island song is that I've been to every state and they suck compared to this one.
[28:52.630 --> 28:54.310]  It's the only one that's like combative.
[28:54.310 --> 29:09.370]  So would you expect, Gavin, if, uh, let's say the Los Angeles Dodgers were to play the Chicago Cubs, that they should play the California and Chicago state songs before the game?
[29:10.870 --> 29:13.190]  That actually, I'm more on board for that.
[29:13.790 --> 29:17.210]  I mean, that would make more sense, but just also just, just crack on, just play the game.
[29:19.950 --> 29:25.350]  What, what is, we're, we do it, we dial it in a little too deep in America, I think.
[29:25.390 --> 29:28.110]  Cause like, what the fuck is the state song for?
[29:28.870 --> 29:33.350]  That's like every, I don't know if they do this in England, but every high school in America has its own song too.
[29:33.950 --> 29:38.050]  And you're supposed to like, you grew up thinking like you're supposed to learn your high school song for some fucking reason.
[29:39.290 --> 29:42.910]  And then your college has a song and then your state has a song.
[29:43.190 --> 29:46.610]  Maybe it happens at the university level, but I, yeah, I never had a song for my school.
[29:46.610 --> 29:55.230]  I really like the idea that anytime any Chicago sports team plays, they have to sing the Superbowl shuffle as the representation of the state.
[29:56.210 --> 30:02.710]  I'm fully supportive of that. If they, whatever, if we're doing state songs and we can move to that, I'm for that. I want to hear that every game.
[30:02.990 --> 30:11.490]  That is, but like every time the governor fucking gives a presentation and he has any kind of a press conference, they have to play Superbowl shuffle first.
[30:12.850 --> 30:14.510]  Geoff, do you remember your high school song?
[30:15.130 --> 30:19.090]  No, not at all. No, I can't. No. Do you remember yours, Eric?
[30:19.530 --> 30:25.230]  Yeah. Yeah. It was just like a little, like, it was just like a little, like, probably like 10 line, 12 line.
[30:25.310 --> 30:26.270]  All right. Well, let's hear it.
[30:26.630 --> 30:33.150]  Well, I just remember that we were the wolf pack. That was our mascot, the West Hills Wolf Pack.
[30:34.990 --> 30:40.910]  And we would talk about, we would say, high above the river valley stands a silver, blue and black.
[30:42.570 --> 30:49.070]  I think it was strong beside our alma mater. We are one. We are the pack. This is the part that I remember all the time.
[30:49.530 --> 30:57.870]  So stand the silver, stand the blue and stand the mighty black. West Hills forever. Our alma mater. We are one. We are the pack.
[30:58.010 --> 31:01.410]  I remember that and I shouldn't. I remember all of that.
[31:01.410 --> 31:04.110]  That's pretty good. Would that go before a sports game?
[31:04.810 --> 31:11.070]  Yeah. Or at like the end of like a rally or like a rally is kind of a maybe touchy term now.
[31:11.290 --> 31:18.930]  Maybe at the end of a presentation or like when they would like when they would have an assembly school assembly, you'd have to say it.
[31:19.110 --> 31:23.150]  Yeah. You jogged my memory. I don't remember all of mine, but I remember it ended with.
[31:23.270 --> 31:27.490]  We love you, dear old Theodore. Because I went to Theodore High School.
[31:27.490 --> 31:33.230]  Oh, that's great. Yeah, I think I think it's quite nice to have like a like a group sense.
[31:33.370 --> 31:37.490]  I feel like every sports game I attended with my school just started with like a whistleblower.
[31:38.210 --> 31:41.330]  There's absolutely nothing. Is everyone here? All right. Crack on. Go on.
[31:41.910 --> 31:45.870]  Hey, guys. Do you think we need an official f*** face song?
[31:47.010 --> 31:51.570]  Similar to Eric's wolf pack thing. Yeah, I like that idea.
[31:51.930 --> 31:55.130]  Like the pride of f*** face? Yeah, the pride of f*** face sounds great.
[31:55.130 --> 31:57.250]  I really like that. That's that we have a title.

[36:19.700 --> 36:20.980]  Oh my god.
[36:21.620 --> 36:23.040]  That's hard on the eyes, dude.
[36:23.380 --> 36:27.840]  I don't know why they did it. It looks so bad. It's awesome.
[36:28.100 --> 36:30.120]  If I was squinting, I'd think I was at SeaWorld.
[36:30.960 --> 36:33.720]  It's got to be discombobulating to try to catch a ball.
[36:34.340 --> 36:38.380]  What I've noticed is that American schools, they've got some budget, man.
[36:39.060 --> 36:42.360]  They've got some bunts. Look at that. It's incredible.
[36:42.640 --> 36:44.280]  Yeah, big time. Big time.
[36:45.280 --> 36:48.360]  I'm not saying you're wrong, but you're looking at a blue field and going like,
[36:48.420 --> 36:49.560]  wow, they got money.
[36:50.140 --> 36:51.940]  Well, I still have room to do that, I assume.
[36:52.680 --> 36:56.260]  Well, I bet it's like a... I bet there's budget in British schools,
[36:56.280 --> 36:59.360]  but all of your buildings are like 7,000 years old.
[36:59.360 --> 37:02.660]  So they probably have to spend most of the budget just fixing shit
[37:02.660 --> 37:03.700]  and keeping them running, right?
[37:03.720 --> 37:06.200]  Like nothing in America is over 30 years old.
[37:06.240 --> 37:08.160]  So it doesn't, you know, everything's pretty brand new here.
[37:08.560 --> 37:11.820]  They got to print 20,000 towels at the end of every year.
[37:12.120 --> 37:13.700]  That money has to go somewhere.
[37:13.960 --> 37:14.620]  The tea towel budget?
[37:15.080 --> 37:15.400]  Yeah.
[37:18.240 --> 37:21.200]  Yeah, I think all of our money goes to keeping the stuff upright
[37:21.200 --> 37:24.000]  and also keeping it looking old, which I think is really expensive.
[37:25.620 --> 37:27.140]  So stupid, but yeah, you're right.
[37:28.360 --> 37:29.660]  The cost of old.
[37:30.540 --> 37:31.480]  Tea towel budget.
[37:32.720 --> 37:35.060]  I'm glad I haven't thought about that in a while.
[37:35.240 --> 37:36.680]  We still haven't made our tea towel.
[37:36.980 --> 37:37.840]  Yeah, like we should.
[37:37.920 --> 37:39.880]  That was something we wanted for RTX, wasn't it?
[37:39.940 --> 37:40.980]  It was an RTX idea.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.040]  We ended up settling on the museum, though.
[37:45.080 --> 37:46.000]  Museum sounds great.
[37:46.680 --> 37:48.340]  Every time I hear anything about the museum.
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.300]  I had to go around my house taking pictures of fucking 8,000 dumb things
[37:53.300 --> 37:54.840]  next to a banana for that.
[37:58.360 --> 37:59.780]  That was your own doing.
[38:00.120 --> 38:00.460]  I know.
[38:00.560 --> 38:03.300]  Like the banana thing you just complained about, but you did that.
[38:03.860 --> 38:06.780]  It was the most common sense thing I had.
[38:06.860 --> 38:08.200]  Everybody knows how big a banana is.
[38:08.520 --> 38:08.680]  Yeah.
[38:08.980 --> 38:12.840]  Like if I put a cup, you'd be like, well, I don't know how many ounces is that cup?
[38:12.940 --> 38:13.180]  I don't know.
[38:13.340 --> 38:15.540]  Yeah, especially if you put a Gerpler down there.
[38:15.600 --> 38:16.840]  I would have no idea what to do.
[38:17.020 --> 38:17.220]  Right.
[38:17.260 --> 38:18.360]  I'd assume everything was huge.
[38:18.580 --> 38:19.400]  Put a phone...
[38:19.400 --> 38:21.840]  I was going to say put a phone down, but I'm using the phone to take the photos,
[38:21.900 --> 38:22.300]  so I can't.
[38:22.420 --> 38:23.320]  You can't.
[38:23.320 --> 38:23.520]  Yeah.
[38:23.620 --> 38:24.560]  My hands really were tied.
[38:25.180 --> 38:25.580]  Yeah.
[38:26.460 --> 38:27.200]  Even with the phone.
[38:27.340 --> 38:28.260]  Maybe it's the XL version.
[38:28.380 --> 38:28.960]  I don't know.
[38:29.920 --> 38:30.460]  Different sizes.
[38:31.020 --> 38:32.140]  It's very true.
[38:32.520 --> 38:33.360]  A banana is a banana.
[38:34.720 --> 38:35.500]  Oh, this was mine.
[38:35.560 --> 38:36.160]  I found it.
[38:36.660 --> 38:37.740]  This is your field?
[38:37.880 --> 38:38.400]  It was the field.
[38:39.260 --> 38:41.800]  So I'd walk out of the school.
[38:42.020 --> 38:43.560]  I'd walk through between some trees.
[38:43.600 --> 38:47.860]  I'd cross a busy road and go through a gap in the hedge, and we'd play there.
[38:52.280 --> 38:53.540]  I mean, it looks like a field.
[38:53.540 --> 38:54.040]  And it wasn't blue.
[38:54.400 --> 38:54.600]  Yeah.
[38:55.360 --> 38:55.760]  Yeah.
[38:55.860 --> 38:56.980]  It didn't have any lines on it or anything.
[38:57.840 --> 38:58.840]  I mean, the photo...
[38:58.840 --> 38:59.240]  I don't know.
[38:59.440 --> 39:03.800]  I feel like I'm looking at something horrible there is the vibe I get from that photo.
[39:04.080 --> 39:05.040]  You think that's horrible?
[39:05.540 --> 39:10.200]  Well, I get the sense of like in a movie, you know, where they show the top down of
[39:10.200 --> 39:13.600]  what's going to get bombed or something bad happened there.
[39:13.680 --> 39:15.020]  That's how I feel when I look at that photo.
[39:15.660 --> 39:15.880]  Yeah.
[39:15.960 --> 39:20.860]  You get down to ground level, and there's just a little sign that says this plaque commemorates
[39:20.860 --> 39:23.640]  the 4,000 lost souls buried on this field.
[39:24.440 --> 39:25.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[39:28.020 --> 39:29.500]  That's kind of a shit field, Gavin.
[39:29.800 --> 39:30.540]  I'm not going to lie.
[39:31.540 --> 39:33.520]  I mean, it's green for a start.
[39:34.220 --> 39:35.600]  It's not even straight.
[39:35.740 --> 39:36.500]  They crookeded it.
[39:36.760 --> 39:37.540]  It's all fucked.
[39:38.600 --> 39:40.020]  But at least it's not blue.
[39:40.220 --> 39:41.320]  I think that's the important thing.
[39:41.320 --> 39:43.160]  It also kind of looks like it's on an incline.
[39:43.260 --> 39:47.060]  I don't know if you can tell, the only like feature of the field that would let you know
[39:47.060 --> 39:52.140]  it was like an athletic field is that that thing in the bottom right that kind of looks
[39:52.140 --> 39:52.960]  like a big cigarette.
[39:53.160 --> 39:55.300]  That was a little like long jump pit.
[39:55.880 --> 39:56.960]  Oh, that was a long... oh.
[39:57.240 --> 39:59.640]  Yeah, it was just like a little bit of sand with a run up.
[40:00.120 --> 40:00.740]  Did you compete?
[40:01.160 --> 40:01.820]  I gave it a go.
[40:01.980 --> 40:02.380]  It was shit.
[40:02.620 --> 40:03.500]  I was crap at that.
[40:03.900 --> 40:04.320]  Long jump?
[40:04.760 --> 40:06.240]  Yeah, but people usually do triple jump.
[40:06.520 --> 40:07.300]  I never understood that.
[40:07.380 --> 40:07.720]  Just jump.
[40:07.880 --> 40:08.260]  Just jump.
[40:08.360 --> 40:09.040]  Just jump once.
[40:09.820 --> 40:10.420]  Yeah, I don't know.
[40:10.740 --> 40:14.620]  I don't know how that is more impressive, the triple jump, as opposed to...
[40:14.620 --> 40:23.020]  I think this is my high school football field, but it jogs no memory and it is unremarkable in every way.
[40:23.320 --> 40:23.920]  Wow.
[40:24.520 --> 40:25.720]  That's so proper.
[40:26.420 --> 40:28.680]  I'm pretty sure that's my high school football field.
[40:28.680 --> 40:31.400]  That looks at least community college level.
[40:32.280 --> 40:32.540]  Really?
[40:33.420 --> 40:34.300]  It's pretty...
[40:34.300 --> 40:36.420]  My high school was a prison.
[40:37.460 --> 40:45.760]  They built my high school to be a prison, but they built it on marshland and the foundation cracked in multiple places while they were constructing it.
[40:45.800 --> 40:50.780]  So they abandoned the idea of it being a prison and it sat unused for a while.
[40:50.900 --> 40:55.340]  And then they decided, well, let's convert it into a high school because it doesn't matter if they sink.
[40:55.840 --> 40:57.940]  Did it have, like, prison-y features?
[40:58.400 --> 41:00.340]  Yeah, it was not a welcoming place.
[41:03.140 --> 41:03.820]  At all.
[41:04.280 --> 41:05.040]  That's dark.
[41:06.420 --> 41:11.040]  It looks nice. You got the logo in the middle of it. You got lines. You got numbers.
[41:12.320 --> 41:16.100]  Let me show you the fucking prison of my fucking high school. Here you go.
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.120]  Real welcoming, that.
[41:20.600 --> 41:27.300]  I think you could show that to people that live internationally. That looks like a high school in a movie.
[41:27.920 --> 41:28.420]  Does it really?
[41:28.760 --> 41:28.780]  It does.
[41:29.200 --> 41:32.200]  It's just a lot of fucking concrete and hallways.
[41:32.200 --> 41:39.980]  I get what you're saying, but dude, that looks like a American high school, the movie, big time. Big time.
[41:40.040 --> 41:44.120]  Should we try and do a little FaceTour and record episodes from each of our schools?
[41:45.040 --> 41:47.160]  I don't want to go to my school.
[41:47.900 --> 41:49.240]  Fucking absolutely not.
[41:49.360 --> 41:49.780]  Why would we do that?
[41:49.780 --> 41:54.420]  Because I feel like it would suck for the person whose school you're at, but it'd be so fascinating for everyone else.
[41:54.720 --> 41:58.420]  That's what happens when I googled American high school and that's what came, the first response.
[42:01.160 --> 42:01.900]  Much nicer.
[42:02.660 --> 42:04.780]  Oh fuck, there's a place called American high school.
[42:06.140 --> 42:06.920]  Look at that.
[42:08.580 --> 42:09.960]  That looks like a prison.
[42:10.520 --> 42:12.900]  Yeah, nevermind, I'm glad I didn't go to American high school.
[42:14.400 --> 42:17.020]  Let us know if you attended American high school.
[42:18.400 --> 42:19.400]  What was it like?
[42:21.100 --> 42:22.400]  Was it as bad as it looks?
[42:23.060 --> 42:24.420]  That's surely not in the US.
[42:24.740 --> 42:25.500]  I don't know.
[42:25.500 --> 42:29.580]  That's like an embassy-style place, right? In a different country?
[42:29.940 --> 42:30.900]  Is that your football field, Nick?
[42:31.360 --> 42:33.580]  Yeah, that's my high school's football field.
[42:34.040 --> 42:34.520]  Damn.
[42:34.660 --> 42:35.100]  Street view.
[42:36.260 --> 42:37.240]  Looks better than when I went.
[42:37.320 --> 42:38.120]  Google street view.
[42:38.380 --> 42:38.820]  Yeah.
[42:42.580 --> 42:44.220]  Proper scoreboard, it's mental.
[42:44.860 --> 42:46.320]  Oh what, they have a scoreboard now?
[42:46.840 --> 42:47.260]  Yeah.
[42:48.100 --> 42:49.980]  That's what the front of my high school looked like.
[42:50.560 --> 42:54.880]  It was very like, here's the performing arts center, and that's it.
[42:54.880 --> 42:57.820]  And then everything else was just, here's the rest of the school, idiot.
[43:03.180 --> 43:06.180]  But it was like, it was like all outdoor.
[43:06.520 --> 43:12.120]  Like my whole high school was like, obviously we were inside for school, for classes.
[43:12.380 --> 43:16.000]  But like getting in between the buildings, it was all outdoor.
[43:16.260 --> 43:16.820]  Like the whole time.
[43:17.340 --> 43:18.700]  Really? It's a nice building, though.
[43:19.040 --> 43:20.020]  It's Southern California, man.
[43:20.780 --> 43:23.920]  Like, the thing that hit in the middle.
[43:26.640 --> 43:27.600]  These wolves.
[43:28.100 --> 43:28.120]  Whoa.
[43:28.460 --> 43:29.500]  These wolf statues.
[43:29.600 --> 43:30.580]  Oh, you had wolves.
[43:30.880 --> 43:31.360]  Whoa.
[43:32.480 --> 43:33.660]  Wolves in the middle of the school.
[43:34.140 --> 43:37.540]  That's like the high school, that's like the Veronica Mars high school, dude.
[43:37.620 --> 43:38.300]  That's fancy.
[43:38.740 --> 43:38.920]  Yeah.
[43:39.120 --> 43:41.940]  Well, they shot, Veronica Mars was filmed at SDSU.
[43:42.660 --> 43:46.180]  So like, it's like the college in San Diego.
[43:46.580 --> 43:46.900]  Damn.
[43:46.900 --> 43:51.700]  How did you go to an all wolf school, but you came away with rat and dog based personas?
[43:53.240 --> 43:54.260]  That's a great point.
[43:54.460 --> 43:58.480]  I think, I think wolves were shoved down my throat for such a long time that now...
[43:58.480 --> 43:59.100]  You're pretty anti-wolf.
[43:59.180 --> 44:02.820]  Yeah, I don't know that I'm like firmly anti-wolf, but I would say that I'm in the camp.
[44:02.880 --> 44:04.700]  I'm pretty like wolf neutral at this point.
[44:04.780 --> 44:06.320]  Like they don't really do anything for me.
[44:06.380 --> 44:07.000]  I just go, look at that.
[44:07.400 --> 44:08.580]  Look at these big dogs.
[44:08.620 --> 44:09.680]  Like they don't do anything for me.
[44:09.880 --> 44:11.760]  At your worst, were you anti-wolf?
[44:11.900 --> 44:13.780]  Like have you rebounded from that or?
[44:14.160 --> 44:16.320]  In high school, pretty firmly anti-wolf.
[44:16.820 --> 44:18.380]  So is this your high school, Gavin?
[44:19.340 --> 44:21.140]  Yeah, that was like the sixth form building.
[44:21.320 --> 44:24.640]  That looks like Hogwarts. You went to fucking Harry Potter school.
[44:26.120 --> 44:28.320]  Did you have servants in the high school?
[44:29.840 --> 44:32.660]  No, but in there was the trophy cabinet where Dan used to stand.
[44:34.940 --> 44:36.580]  Where he was a trophy case wanker?
[44:37.020 --> 44:37.240]  Yeah.
[44:38.320 --> 44:40.080]  Eric, did the wolves have names?
[44:40.580 --> 44:44.900]  No, no, we were just simply the wolf pack. We were a collection of wolves.
[44:45.620 --> 44:49.380]  Um, that I suppose shared a consciousness.
[44:49.600 --> 44:52.780]  I'm not really, again, I have never really thought that deeply about it.
[44:53.080 --> 44:54.340]  But, um...
[44:54.340 --> 44:55.980]  Was the rival school of the vampires?
[44:56.280 --> 44:59.400]  No, the rival school was Santana.
[45:01.420 --> 45:04.820]  And their mascot, I don't know if this is what it is still.
[45:04.920 --> 45:08.700]  I assume it is because it's Santee, California and nothing changes.
[45:09.200 --> 45:11.540]  Uh, their mascot is the Sultan.
[45:11.820 --> 45:13.740]  And it is, and it looks like that.
[45:13.980 --> 45:14.460]  Oh.
[45:14.460 --> 45:15.220]  Yeah.
[45:15.600 --> 45:17.240]  It looks like the Akinator.
[45:17.740 --> 45:22.600]  It looks like he's gonna guess who you're imagining.
[45:23.320 --> 45:25.480]  It looks like Zoltar after he's changed the tire.
[45:26.580 --> 45:30.320]  And Zoltar realizing he needs to change the tire. He's real upset about it.
[45:30.480 --> 45:35.820]  I wonder if corporate sponsors will ever sponsor high schools like they sponsor arenas.
[45:36.280 --> 45:38.840]  Like, could you have the Akinator High?
[45:41.900 --> 45:43.860]  I guess, I mean, I don't know why you couldn't.
[45:44.220 --> 45:44.540]  Right?
[45:47.300 --> 45:48.760]  Hop into my high school field.
[45:49.400 --> 45:52.960]  Like, your high school, you could be the Goodyear blimps.
[45:54.160 --> 45:56.740]  Okay, Andrew wins for the high school field.
[45:57.040 --> 45:58.620]  My high school field was great.
[45:59.840 --> 46:01.160]  What could you get done there?
[46:01.880 --> 46:03.160]  You could mow that lawn.
[46:05.080 --> 46:06.620]  Recess time, get the weed whacker.
[46:16.020 --> 46:20.260]  Good game of frisbee back there. That's about it. You got frisbee, you got mowing the lawn.
[46:20.540 --> 46:24.540]  You could stand there and take a photo holding your fucking ray gun for your men in black costume.
[46:24.620 --> 46:26.140]  Oh, that's true. Yeah, that was a different yard.
[46:26.220 --> 46:27.640]  But yeah, you could do that.
[46:27.980 --> 46:29.420]  Could clean the birdbath.
[46:29.900 --> 46:31.940]  All sorts of things you could do in my high school field.
[46:32.300 --> 46:33.600]  You are very funny, Andrew.
[46:36.940 --> 46:39.420]  Nick said you could do the sewing machine.
[46:39.560 --> 46:39.900]  No!
[46:42.260 --> 46:45.780]  I have never done the sewing machine on grass. I don't trust it.
[46:46.240 --> 46:50.500]  That's a purely concrete scenario.
[46:51.200 --> 46:52.260]  Did you have uniforms?
[46:54.940 --> 46:55.400]  Sure.
[46:59.580 --> 47:01.680]  Every day of the week at my school.
[47:05.700 --> 47:08.380]  No, no, I did not have a uniform. Eric, did you?
[47:08.820 --> 47:11.820]  No, no, no, no. We were in normal Southern California.
[47:11.820 --> 47:15.980]  I mean, it might as well have been a uniform of shorts and a hurly t-shirt.
[47:16.180 --> 47:18.040]  But no, it was not a mandated uniform.
[47:18.100 --> 47:20.500]  Nick, I can all but guarantee you didn't have one, right?
[47:21.120 --> 47:22.780]  No, that was definitely a public school.
[47:22.880 --> 47:24.520]  I did work at a school uniform store, though.
[47:27.340 --> 47:27.980]  Wait, what?
[47:27.980 --> 47:30.880]  There's a store specifically for school uniforms?
[47:30.980 --> 47:32.120]  Did I just get given it?
[47:32.720 --> 47:34.720]  Oh, no, no, you're not given your school uniform.
[47:34.860 --> 47:36.120]  You have to, like, buy this stuff.
[47:36.580 --> 47:39.680]  I mean, we bought it, but you didn't have to go to a store and buy it.
[47:42.260 --> 47:43.540]  Yeah, they had a store at the mall.
[47:44.580 --> 47:46.320]  At the mall? Not even at the school?
[47:46.700 --> 47:47.580]  Yeah, it was at the mall.
[47:48.040 --> 47:50.460]  You worked at the mall? Did we know that?
[47:51.060 --> 47:52.320]  Oh, I don't think so. I forgot.
[47:52.560 --> 47:52.860]  No!
[47:53.160 --> 47:55.440]  All these stories about all these times...
[47:55.440 --> 47:58.340]  I want to invent a show where we hang out at the mall.
[47:58.440 --> 48:00.680]  We've talked about wanting to all work at the mall together.
[48:00.780 --> 48:03.040]  You never mentioned that you worked at a literal mall?
[48:03.240 --> 48:05.720]  You didn't dropped the school uniform store?
[48:09.860 --> 48:10.660]  That's a good point.
[48:12.780 --> 48:14.140]  I think I messed up.
[48:14.200 --> 48:14.960]  Maybe it wasn't good.
[48:15.360 --> 48:18.120]  What was it like working at the school uniform store in the mall?
[48:18.800 --> 48:19.980]  It was weird.
[48:20.140 --> 48:23.220]  So it was like a Catholic school uniform store.
[48:23.560 --> 48:29.600]  They only sold, like, specific, like, for specific schools.
[48:29.960 --> 48:31.140]  And they had different age ranges.
[48:31.140 --> 48:32.780]  And they had, like, jumpers for certain ages.
[48:32.780 --> 48:37.700]  And then, like, a wide variety of, like, skirts, shirts.
[48:37.700 --> 48:40.260]  And then, like, those khaki pants.
[48:40.820 --> 48:46.540]  So if you wanted to, you could buy a uniform for the wrong school and wear it to the school you're going to?
[48:46.740 --> 48:48.280]  I imagine they frowned upon it.
[48:48.300 --> 48:49.320]  But, yeah, you totally could.
[48:49.980 --> 48:55.040]  Like, you didn't check somebody's school ID when you sold them a t-shirt or anything?
[48:55.280 --> 48:57.860]  No, we had, like, a binder with, like, a reference page.
[48:57.900 --> 48:59.640]  And we're just like, what school do you go to?
[48:59.680 --> 49:00.740]  And they're like, what size?
[49:00.820 --> 49:02.380]  Like, okay, here you go. Take a look at this.
[49:03.000 --> 49:04.640]  And you're mostly dealing with parents.
[49:04.640 --> 49:07.180]  But sometimes it's kids that are like, this sucks.
[49:08.360 --> 49:09.600]  So it was a weird job.
[49:09.600 --> 49:13.840]  Is it all, like, are you guys maintaining the stock for all the schools?
[49:14.040 --> 49:17.260]  Or is that something that, like, you put an order in and then they come pick it up in two weeks?
[49:19.120 --> 49:20.260]  We're maintaining stock.
[49:20.440 --> 49:22.200]  So it's, like, something you always kind of cycle through.
[49:22.920 --> 49:24.700]  Most of the time, though, I was on the floor.
[49:24.860 --> 49:27.320]  I didn't deal so much with the other money thing.
[49:28.420 --> 49:30.780]  I worked at a Hollister that I hated.
[49:31.020 --> 49:38.320]  And the person I was dating at the time was like, you want a job at this uniform store?
[49:38.320 --> 49:41.140]  And so I worked, oh, so that's two places in the mall.
[49:41.260 --> 49:41.700]  Geoff, I'm sorry.
[49:41.720 --> 49:42.320]  What the hell?
[49:42.640 --> 49:44.540]  Hollister doesn't exist outside of the mall.
[49:44.840 --> 49:46.020]  I forgot, I'm sorry!
[49:47.540 --> 49:53.100]  What made it so you hated Hollister so much that you were gonna go to, like, it's Hollister.
[49:53.480 --> 49:55.340]  It smells funny in there and the music sucks.
[49:56.140 --> 49:57.120]  What is Hollister?
[49:58.460 --> 50:00.060]  It's like a dickhead clothing store.
[50:00.180 --> 50:00.800]  Yeah, okay.
[50:00.940 --> 50:02.360]  And you feel like a dickhead, exactly.
[50:03.420 --> 50:04.460]  The music sucks.
[50:04.460 --> 50:08.620]  So you went from dickhead clothing store to selling school clothes?
[50:08.620 --> 50:10.300]  To religious dickhead clothing store.
[50:10.540 --> 50:15.660]  I would have definitely bought outfits at different schools and I would have felt real sneaky about that.
[50:15.840 --> 50:17.120]  I would have felt like a secret agent.
[50:17.540 --> 50:18.820]  Slipped through those halls undetected.
[50:18.980 --> 50:21.540]  Once again, sneaky. That's a sneaky move by me.
[50:21.740 --> 50:29.120]  Like, I had a friend in high school who any time you quit your job, it was known he wanted to buy your work shirt.
[50:29.120 --> 50:34.660]  So, like, my friend quit working at Ecker's Drug and he would, like, I'll give you ten bucks for your work shirt, don't turn it in.
[50:35.180 --> 50:36.840]  And he would just, like, collect them.
[50:37.000 --> 50:44.060]  He had shirts, like, collared shirts from, like, every pharmacy and grocery store or wherever you had them in our area.
[50:44.060 --> 50:47.760]  And I never knew what he wanted to do. I always assumed he had, like, a plan with them.
[50:48.060 --> 50:49.860]  Was his name Agent 47?
[50:50.640 --> 50:51.980]  No, his name was Brian.
[50:52.280 --> 50:55.820]  But I always assumed he would, like, sneak in and steal stock or something, but I don't know.
[50:55.820 --> 51:00.500]  Or he might have just thought it was really cool to pretend like he worked at a 7-Eleven.
[51:00.880 --> 51:09.400]  I'm imagining going into Brian's house and seeing, like, the 7-Eleven shirt framed and being like, yeah, this is Game 1 right here.
[51:09.720 --> 51:12.440]  Game 1, 2003, 2004, 7-Eleven.
[51:13.460 --> 51:16.360]  I wonder which work shirt gets you the most access.
[51:16.920 --> 51:19.660]  I think, like, a FedEx shirt. You could walk into any building.
[51:20.920 --> 51:21.980]  Oh, that's a good one.
[51:22.080 --> 51:23.900]  That is a good one. FedEx, UPS. Yeah.
[51:23.900 --> 51:25.800]  Yeah, maybe UPS.
[51:26.440 --> 51:29.860]  My brain immediately answered President, but that's a terrible answer.
[51:30.080 --> 51:32.080]  It's not, it's just like a suit, I guess.
[51:32.240 --> 51:34.320]  I'd love it if the President had to wear a uniform.
[51:37.820 --> 51:40.040]  Like, he had to dress like Uncle Sam every day.
[51:40.300 --> 51:42.580]  He had to go to the mall to the President's store to get his outfit.
[51:45.200 --> 51:47.700]  He just gets one visitor every four years.
[51:48.840 --> 51:49.680]  Oh, man.
[51:50.520 --> 51:51.320]  That's so funny.
[51:51.980 --> 51:53.640]  Fake work or fork?
[51:56.640 --> 52:00.640]  My friend created this thing that he called Ferk, which is fake work.
[52:01.220 --> 52:04.020]  And his parents made him get a job in high school.
[52:04.360 --> 52:06.620]  And he worked at a Schlotzky's.
[52:07.040 --> 52:09.440]  But what he would do is, he would put on his uniform.
[52:09.620 --> 52:10.780]  He'd tell his parents he was going to work.
[52:10.880 --> 52:16.680]  He'd drive his car to the Schlotzky's, leave it, and then have someone else pick him up.
[52:17.260 --> 52:19.500]  And he would go and do whatever throughout the day.
[52:19.500 --> 52:21.220]  Then he'd go back in his car and come home.
[52:21.680 --> 52:23.800]  And he thought he was getting away with it for a long time.
[52:23.860 --> 52:26.260]  And then his dad went through the drive-thru one day.
[52:26.460 --> 52:29.960]  It was like, is so-and-so here?
[52:30.120 --> 52:31.060]  And they're like, who?
[52:32.300 --> 52:33.220]  Oh, no.
[52:35.980 --> 52:40.020]  That's classic empty briefcase style of going somewhere every day.
[52:40.360 --> 52:41.880]  That's fucking awesome.
[52:42.320 --> 52:44.680]  What was he doing about not having money?
[52:48.080 --> 52:49.620]  He's literally the same guy.
[52:49.720 --> 52:51.100]  I went on a trip with him to Vegas.
[52:51.240 --> 52:52.560]  This will tell you how he is with his money.
[52:53.200 --> 52:55.720]  And on the first day, he brought a certain amount of money.
[52:55.900 --> 53:01.740]  And he told me he lost it all in the airport casino before he even left.
[53:02.800 --> 53:06.780]  And he just bummed off of us the rest of the trip.
[53:07.160 --> 53:10.260]  And then on the last day, I don't know where he got this money from, too.
[53:10.260 --> 53:17.740]  He was all the way up on Roulette.
[53:18.500 --> 53:21.440]  And he was up like a thousand bucks.
[53:21.520 --> 53:23.580]  I have no idea where he got the money to even put down the money.
[53:23.760 --> 53:25.340]  And then I was like, oh, that's great. We should go.
[53:25.440 --> 53:26.580]  He's like, just one more, just one more.
[53:27.200 --> 53:28.540]  And then he lost it all.
[53:31.020 --> 53:32.140]  So that'll tell you...
[53:32.140 --> 53:34.220]  I think he fell off the first hurdle of Vegas.
[53:34.500 --> 53:36.580]  And that's why they had to sell Empire Records.
[53:37.280 --> 53:37.980]  That's a shame.
[53:37.980 --> 53:39.040]  And Shlossky's went under.
[53:39.900 --> 53:42.440]  I love the idea of furking.
[53:43.600 --> 53:47.900]  I wonder if there's any furkers in the regulation listeners.
[53:48.060 --> 53:50.240]  Dude, you've been furking for like 18 years.
[53:51.160 --> 53:51.640]  What?
[53:54.460 --> 53:55.260]  What do you mean?
[53:57.380 --> 54:01.500]  You just play with cameras in video games. That's not a real job.
[54:02.140 --> 54:02.580]  That's fair.
[54:03.700 --> 54:04.540]  We're all furkers.
[54:04.900 --> 54:06.100]  Somehow it's hard work, though.
[54:06.100 --> 54:06.540]  I don't know how.
[54:06.560 --> 54:07.460]  No, I know. I'm kidding.
[54:07.600 --> 54:08.420]  It's really tiring.
[54:08.800 --> 54:14.120]  For the record and for the audience, you're the hardest working person I've ever met in my life.
[54:14.180 --> 54:14.780]  I feel like we're all out there.
[54:16.780 --> 54:25.460]  I know someone who did a Nick-like approach with his friend, but they lost their job and they were too scared to tell their parents and they lived at home.
[54:26.100 --> 54:30.740]  And so they spent the next three and a half weeks spending their working hours at the library.
[54:31.440 --> 54:34.760]  They would drive out and they'd just park and they'd hide at the library.
[54:34.760 --> 54:37.640]  They figured that that'd be one spot where they wouldn't be discovered.
[54:39.080 --> 54:39.920]  It's tragic.
[54:40.960 --> 54:41.720]  Very tragic.
[54:41.840 --> 54:49.480]  Also, just say, I couldn't spend three consecutive weeks at the library from open to close like an eight hour shift.
[54:49.740 --> 54:50.540]  This is terrible.
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.960]  I mean, unless you were using the library to find a job.
[54:54.180 --> 54:55.660]  I don't know if they were.
[54:55.920 --> 54:57.000]  I think they were just hiding.
[54:57.200 --> 54:58.520]  I think it was purely a hide move.
[54:58.920 --> 55:00.140]  It's like a mourning period.
[55:06.380 --> 55:07.740]  Where would you hide, Andrea?
[55:07.900 --> 55:12.180]  If you, like, say your occupation was to run marathons for us.
[55:12.480 --> 55:13.440]  Where would you go instead?
[55:16.920 --> 55:19.800]  And I need to present that I'm running marathons.
[55:20.140 --> 55:21.600]  I'm trying to figure it out.
[55:22.100 --> 55:25.660]  We'll say you were going out training for marathons, but clearly you're not going to go and do that.
[55:26.180 --> 55:26.360]  Yeah.
[55:27.960 --> 55:29.280]  Okay, where would I hide?
[55:29.280 --> 55:29.900]  Yeah.
[55:31.240 --> 55:33.280]  I'm trying to think of, like, what's...
[55:35.340 --> 55:38.300]  Maybe, like, the movie theater, but you might go there.
[55:38.840 --> 55:39.040]  Yeah.
[55:39.240 --> 55:40.740]  I think movie theater's good.
[55:41.160 --> 55:44.220]  You'd have to only see movies you know Gavin doesn't want to see.
[55:44.820 --> 55:45.140]  Yeah.
[55:45.360 --> 55:48.240]  Anything that's just in regular motion, I think.
[55:48.340 --> 55:50.120]  Or maybe things with slow motion.
[55:50.280 --> 55:54.720]  Maybe you don't want to see slow motion after all the slow motion you see.
[55:55.780 --> 55:56.180]  Huh.
[55:58.200 --> 56:00.800]  The mall... the mall is not a great place.
[56:01.100 --> 56:02.720]  I'll find you immediately.
[56:02.900 --> 56:05.980]  I definitely skipped school one time and I encountered a teacher at the mall.
[56:07.760 --> 56:08.580]  That wasn't good.
[56:08.840 --> 56:10.580]  I would be right up your ass if you were trying to hide from me.
[56:10.580 --> 56:11.300]  Oh, you would? Yeah.
[56:11.460 --> 56:12.480]  No, I couldn't hide from you at the mall.
[56:12.520 --> 56:13.000]  There's no way.
[56:13.040 --> 56:13.480]  Where would I go?
[56:14.740 --> 56:17.380]  Well, I feel like certain stores. I don't think you're going to the GameStop.
[56:17.680 --> 56:20.540]  I think there's certain places where I feel pretty safe to avoid you.
[56:20.620 --> 56:22.200]  You're right, I'm staying pretty fucking far away from GameStop.
[56:22.800 --> 56:25.540]  What if we just did it, like, right in front of everyone's faces?
[56:25.540 --> 56:29.600]  What if we open a store called The Hiding Spot and it doesn't really sell anything.
[56:29.720 --> 56:31.740]  It's just where people can go if they want to be somewhere.
[56:31.920 --> 56:35.120]  But I don't think anyone would ever go in there unless they were hiding from something.
[56:36.480 --> 56:39.680]  That's an interesting atmosphere, though. A bunch of people hiding from something.
[56:40.120 --> 56:41.540]  It's like the money laundromat.
[56:43.060 --> 56:48.720]  It could just be full of, like, almost like little...
[56:48.720 --> 56:57.920]  It could almost be like cubicles in an office with just, like, little chairs.
[56:58.620 --> 57:03.140]  And when you sit down, and they're not tall walls, but you sit down and you can't make eye contact with anybody else.
[57:03.220 --> 57:06.920]  You can't see them. And then you can just kind of play on your phone and pretend like the world doesn't exist.
[57:06.940 --> 57:09.520]  You walk in and it would just be a bunch of people pretending to be working.
[57:09.780 --> 57:12.140]  Yeah, it would look like office space.
[57:13.640 --> 57:14.560]  I love that.
[57:14.880 --> 57:15.320]  I do, too.
[57:18.760 --> 57:21.860]  We all put in our crisps order, didn't we? Our chips.
[57:22.240 --> 57:26.460]  Yeah, we were gonna record that today, but... Well, I don't have mine yet, so they clearly didn't get it in time.
[57:26.820 --> 57:27.200]  There you go.
[57:27.280 --> 57:31.420]  I found it extremely difficult to pare down to four. So hard.
[57:31.860 --> 57:35.580]  I did, too. And I had to take a stance.
[57:35.860 --> 57:41.800]  Because, you know, we were talking ahead of time about, like, what constitutes a chip.
[57:42.080 --> 57:46.200]  Like, what would be appropriate. And we agreed that corn snacks would work.
[57:47.360 --> 57:49.760]  Stuff like Cheetos would be allowed.
[57:50.100 --> 57:54.140]  And that makes it really hard. I don't know about your countries, but it makes it really hard in America.
[57:54.140 --> 57:57.380]  Because there's just so much variety of that kind of stuff.
[57:57.540 --> 58:00.980]  And so I decided that I was gonna stick to the letter of the word.
[58:01.020 --> 58:03.300]  And I only picked potato chips.
[58:03.920 --> 58:09.400]  So I don't know that I picked, like, the four best across that broad spectrum that we had allowed.
[58:09.560 --> 58:13.200]  But I definitely think I nailed the four potato chips, specifically.
[58:13.780 --> 58:15.580]  Are we filming that on an office day?
[58:15.580 --> 58:16.700]  Yeah, I think so.
[58:17.160 --> 58:18.380]  At the office?
[58:19.240 --> 58:21.540]  Yeah, I guess so.
[58:22.200 --> 58:23.980]  Yeah, because we have other stuff we have to do.
[58:25.900 --> 58:27.800]  Are we not doing that stuff in person?
[58:28.720 --> 58:29.380]  Yeah, let's do it.
[58:30.000 --> 58:30.720]  Which stuff?
[58:31.520 --> 58:35.020]  Well, chip stuff doesn't necessarily need to be, but the other things that are planned.
[58:35.340 --> 58:39.640]  You made a very good consideration of, we still need to do the stinky port-o-potty thing.
[58:39.840 --> 58:45.060]  But Eric didn't want it to be done until post-RTX, because people are gonna be in there.
[58:45.060 --> 58:47.060]  But I was voted down, so...
[58:47.740 --> 58:49.060]  So if it smells...
[58:49.760 --> 58:50.880]  You know who to blame.
[58:51.120 --> 58:52.540]  Yeah, don't. I mean, certainly not me.
[58:52.660 --> 58:55.920]  Because I've made my point, and I was told, get a bucket.
[58:56.100 --> 58:59.380]  If anything, it gives people a much more authentic experience.
[58:59.660 --> 59:00.900]  I don't think that's what people want.
[59:01.560 --> 59:06.660]  Like, one of the things in the f***face museum is just a whiff.
[59:06.960 --> 59:07.420]  I love that.
[59:09.620 --> 59:11.560]  You stick your head in a box and get a whiff.
[59:13.520 --> 59:14.780]  Nick's gonna throw up.
[59:15.280 --> 59:19.220]  Can we ask Wes to make a whiff box for us?
[59:20.580 --> 59:22.220]  Just like in the Huff Zone?
[59:22.500 --> 59:26.800]  I mean, like, the port-o-potty's gonna be the f***ing whiff box, dude.
[59:27.620 --> 59:30.480]  We don't have to make anything, we're gonna make it on Wednesday.
[59:31.260 --> 59:33.600]  What if it's in the hole? What if it's in the shitter hole?
[59:33.780 --> 59:34.200]  The whiff zone.
[59:35.120 --> 59:36.180]  You just put it in there.
[59:37.500 --> 59:39.340]  You gotta stick your head in the shitter hole.
[59:39.340 --> 59:42.320]  You gotta stick your head in the shitter hole to go into the whiff zone.
[59:42.860 --> 59:45.200]  I don't wanna do that to people.
[59:47.280 --> 59:50.140]  Well, the whiff zone is optional. You don't have to.
[59:50.260 --> 59:53.320]  But if you wanna enter the whiff zone, you know where to go.
[59:53.520 --> 59:55.100]  You don't have to ram your head in the huff box.
[59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.760]  Hey, did we include the port-o-potty in the museum?
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.880]  I don't know if we wrote that down, but I always assume so.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.460]  There's no way that it's not there.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.380]  The museum should be built around it.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:07.520]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.520]  I'll double-check, and then someone will go,
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.320]  Well, no, it's not.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.900]  And then it will be. Don't worry.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.700]  Now that's been spoken into the universe.
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.800]  Did you take a picture of it next to a ruler, Eric?
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:18.980]  I didn't, no.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.960]  Because it's in a place that's at the office.
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:23.200]  That they have access to.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:23.680]  Yeah.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.840]  So no one had to take a picture with a banana?
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.560]  I really wanna see a banana next to the port-o-potty.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.020]  Dumb.
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:31.940]  So, Eric wants us to wrap up.
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.660]  He wants us to stop talking.
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.840]  How did you guys feel recording on a Friday?
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:36.920]  Different vibe.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.080]  Different vibe, right?
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.640]  I was a little, I felt a little thrown at the beginning.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.060]  I just felt a little off my game.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.740]  Well, everyone was late.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.940]  Yeah, do you blame that on Friday?
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.520]  Or do you blame that on Gavin panicking?
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.180]  I think it's a little bit of both.
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.080]  Yeah, because I had all my nervous energy still yesterday.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:53.360]  Yeah.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:54.960]  I didn't know what to do with myself.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.780]  I was all hopped up.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.840]  And then I got kind of tired.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.380]  And now today I have less energy because I freaked out about it yesterday.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.720]  I couldn't spend the hyped-up energy where I needed to.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:06.440]  Gavin?
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.320]  I think it was a double play.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.000]  We're recording earlier and a Friday.
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:10.540]  I think both things come into effect.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:10.880]  Interesting.
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.180]  Gavin and I hung out socially the other day.
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:13.860]  It was really nice.
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.060]  It was good to see you.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:15.540]  That's great.
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:16.600]  What did you two do?
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.060]  We went to this bar.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.280]  I don't drink, of course.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:25.140]  But we went to this bar and met with two other friends of ours, Nick and Jason Saldana.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.280]  And we just...
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.680]  We recreated a photo that I'd taken 18 years earlier.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:31.480]  Oh, yeah.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.520]  Do you want to put that in?
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.000]  Do you have that?
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:33.560]  Should I put that in?
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.140]  Yeah, sure.
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:34.920]  Okay.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:35.940]  It was cute.
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:42.780]  Historically, within the context of Rooster Teeth, Jason is one of the guys that helped
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.780]  create Rooster Teeth and Red vs. Blue.
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.300]  And then his brother, Nick, also exists.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.560]  His brother, Nick, actually hooked me up.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.900]  He gave me a name for something.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:57.160]  Oh.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:59.560]  Related to F*** Face or just in general?
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:00.340]  Just in general.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.400]  For a different project.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:02.780]  But I was explaining it.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.060]  I was explaining a project to him, and he threw out a name.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.480]  And I'm definitely going to use that name now.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.840]  So this is from the day I met Geoff.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:09.660]  This was...
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:10.300]  I'd known...
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:13.100]  I'd met Geoff like an hour ago at this point in this photo.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.440]  And that's Jason with him.
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:16.980]  And I think Nick is actually in the mirror.
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.260]  Yeah, he is.
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:19.620]  And then...
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:20.720]  So that was 2005.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:21.980]  And this is 2023.
[01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:31.050]  I gotta say, I'm impressed with the hand, Geoff, because that is a very specific gesture you had.
[01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:31.970]  We took a few takes.
[01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:33.690]  I took a lot.
[01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:40.590]  Gavin loves to retake a photo after a long period of time.
[01:02:40.850 --> 01:02:41.610]  I think it's funny.
[01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:44.450]  Yeah, it's one of the things that I love about you.
[01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:46.050]  You're always on top of that.
[01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:50.930]  Something about people aging is so interesting to me.
[01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:54.570]  Like, it's so weird to look at a picture of myself 20 years ago and be like, oh, gee.
[01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:56.870]  Because you don't notice any of it happening at the time.
[01:02:57.070 --> 01:02:58.490]  And you're just like, oof, yikes.
[01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:00.630]  But I think both of you look pretty good.
[01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:01.590]  Thanks, man.
[01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:03.690]  We should do that again in...
[01:03:04.450 --> 01:03:05.150]  Another 18?
[01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:06.490]  Another 18 more years.
[01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:07.710]  18 more years, yeah.
[01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:10.190]  That's a long time, dude. 18 years.
[01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:11.970]  That's a lot of time.
[01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:16.730]  I like that in the first picture I'd known you an hour, and in the second picture I've known you 18 years.
[01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:18.990]  Your finger looks the same, though.
[01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:19.830]  It does.
[01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:22.730]  I didn't even notice your finger.
[01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:24.470]  Yeah, I'm pointing at Jason for some reason.
[01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:26.590]  You can see there's...
[01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:30.050]  Most of my tattoos are still there back then.
[01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:31.790]  At least visible ones, except for my hand stuff.
[01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:33.650]  Yeah, you've had it a few.
[01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:33.910]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:35.290]  That's crazy.
[01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:41.550]  I guess we should probably shoot this one in the back of the head.
[01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:43.790]  We're gonna kill this one?
[01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:45.290]  Yeah, this is...
[01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:47.010]  Tie a couple of nooses around his neck.
[01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:48.070]  I learned something.
[01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:50.210]  Gavin, you run west, I'm gonna run east.
[01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.850]  Okay.
[01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:52.270]  Oh, shit.
[01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:53.730]  I can only go north.
[01:03:57.810 --> 01:03:58.430]  What'd you learn?
[01:03:59.410 --> 01:04:01.870]  I learned that I don't know what scalping is, just to rehash that.
[01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:03.970]  I clearly... I thought...
[01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:10.170]  I saw a lot of people being like I was scalping with my idea, and I really didn't think it was, and then I realized, well, no, it is.
[01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:11.290]  What did you think scalping was?
[01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:18.750]  I think... I thought scalping was, like, going above market value because you wanted to?
[01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:21.390]  Like, I understood, like, the second-hand market...
[01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:21.650]  Like price, Gavin.
[01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:22.590]  Like, I thought intent...
[01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:36.230]  Yeah, like, I thought intent mattered, but, like, on the surface where I was like, I'm buying tickets for a thing I never plan on attending, and I'm selling them for whatever the markup price of... I'm just scalping. That's a bad idea. Do not do that.
[01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:40.410]  So when all of us went, you mean scalping? Like, that wasn't a hint? That wasn't a clue?
[01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:44.010]  No, I had to, you know, I had to think about it.
[01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:50.030]  I would intent be anything... You think that... Insane. That's so crazy.
[01:04:50.030 --> 01:05:03.150]  That was my processing was I'm not scalping because I'm not trying to rip people off. I'm just... I'm just selling at what the second-hand market is, but then I realized the second-hand market is literally the most you can get above the price.
[01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:04.730]  It's the scalping market.
[01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:06.590]  God, Jesus Christ.
[01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:09.990]  Yeah, no, exactly. I'm saying I didn't know and I know now. I learned.
[01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:12.090]  Not scalping, I'm reselling.
[01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:14.490]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:15.650]  And...
[01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:20.290]  You were further off than I was about being born in the middle of the 70s.
[01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:25.050]  Okay, we...
[01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:32.750]  I love that so much. I love it when we when we admit that we have a fundamental misunderstanding about something.
[01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:33.290]  Oh, yeah.
[01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:33.770]  That's the best.
[01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:36.970]  Well, here's the thing. We're too stupid to hide it, right?
[01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:37.390]  Yeah.
[01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:44.350]  Like, you know, like none of us are smart enough to dig our way out of a hole. You might as well just embrace the dirt.
[01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:49.170]  I wish I knew all the things that are common knowledge that I don't know. That's the problem.
[01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:54.430]  Like, Gavin taught me recently that my keyboard had a second enter button on it. I had no idea. I would have never found that.
[01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:56.690]  I wish...
[01:05:56.690 --> 01:06:03.170]  I honestly, the second I land in Vancouver, we're sitting down and we're learning the keyboard.
[01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:07.410]  I'm gonna run you through every freaking button on that thing.
[01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:10.310]  You're gonna come away a much more efficient man.
[01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:14.510]  Mario taught me how to type, okay? I got a Mario accreditation.
[01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:15.790]  He was an idiot, apparently.
[01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:18.310]  He was incompetent.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.260]  Supplemental content of YouTube teaching me key by key.
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:29.900]  Oh, don't worry. I'll definitely film it.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.360]  I can't wait to see you guys next week. Are we doing another episode next week?
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:36.980]  And we've got Office Day.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.760]  And we have Office Day next week as well.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.000]  It's gonna be an eventful f***face week next week.
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:42.700]  We're gonna top up our supplementals.
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:44.700]  I am very excited about both.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:49.600]  And I also, I didn't even get to mention it, but I've been riding my bike every day again to get...
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:54.880]  Because of Eric, honestly, I was complaining to Eric about how much I don't like to run or lift weights.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.820]  And he was like, just ride your bike. When you rode your bike, you were fine.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.240]  And I was like, he's got a good point.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.280]  So I've been riding my bike 22 miles every morning.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.700]  And I've been doing it like six or seven in the morning.
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.040]  And so I've discovered that the world is different.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.580]  Even the bike paths and the parks are different at 6 and 7 AM.
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:14.760]  So I have a few observations that I...
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.440]  I just want to point out, we do need to end.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:20.060]  But I do want to point out that Geoff made me sound exacerbated from go.
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:21.740]  And that is not how the conversation went.
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.780]  He did an impression of me at the end of the conversation.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:28.580]  Where he kept telling me how, no, he's going to run.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.140]  And so that was me at the end of the conversation.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.760]  Yeah, it was the important part.
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.200]  I just want to clarify.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.240]  Okay, end this now.
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:41.280]  I've also been putting off constructing the scoops, the ice cream gloves.
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:44.040]  Because I felt like we could potentially do that in person.
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.600]  I think that's a great idea.
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.660]  I think that's part of that concept.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:52.380]  So next week we could eat chips, do the gloves, and smell the psalmstrom.
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:52.960]  Yep.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.380]  That's going to be a hell of a day.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.700]  I can't wait. I'm so excited.
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.940]  I'm excited too. I wonder what else we can cram in there.
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.880]  Well, the only way to find out is to end this.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.940]  So that way time can move forward and we can get there.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:12.600]  By the way, how are we getting Andrew piped into the stink potty experience?
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:16.680]  Well, we can talk about that as soon as we end this episode.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.280]  I can't. I have to go after this. My mom's in town.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.820]  I literally came from the airport to pick her up here to record this episode.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.720]  Now I haven't even really talked to her yet.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.580]  Why don't you wrap up so you can spend time with her?
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:27.240]  Tell your mom I said hi.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.040]  Oh dude, you know what she got me for my birthday?
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:29.720]  This sucks.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:30.280]  What did she get you?
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.960]  She just gave it to me right before we came in.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:36.560]  You remember when I told you guys that story about the Toonyville choo-choo that I had?
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.680]  It was like, I think it was the cover of one of them.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.760]  Oh, that plastic thing?
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:43.800]  Yeah, that I had a kid that played the little music records that were so fucking loud and obnoxious.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.620]  My mom got me one for my birthday.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.200]  I'm so glad that I was going to do that and I changed.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:50.440]  I didn't do that.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.440]  Yeah, no, she here, I took a photo.
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:51.840]  You almost ended up with two of them.
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.320]  Oh dude, I would love to have two of them. I could have them race.
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:57.420]  Yeah, just hold on a second.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.400]  I know Eric is excited about this and he wants me to send the photo.
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:03.140]  Yeah, we got to see this Toonyville situation.
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:04.320]  Oh, I hit the wrong thing.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.660]  Eric has moved into Enshowchat.
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:10.400]  I don't think I described it at the time when I posted my back.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.080]  I was homeschooled. That was that joke.
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:13.320]  I don't think that was ever vocalized.
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:14.420]  Oh, I knew.
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.220]  Was that the actual, the actual place?
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.860]  Yeah, that was my backyard at the time of high school.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:23.600]  That's really good.
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.660]  I don't know why, but for.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.900]  Well, hold on, let me do it this way.
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.220]  Oh, we're having a hard time with Toonyville.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:29.420]  Yeah, I just.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.180]  All right, here we go.
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.260]  Can I send this?
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:33.760]  Is it too big?
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:34.700]  Do we need nitro?
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:35.640]  Is nitro back?
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.620]  Let me see if I can do it this way.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.580]  Discards being a pain.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:41.700]  There we go.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.880]  Oh, it looks fucking brand new.
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:46.120]  Oh, how great that is.
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:47.380]  That looks so nice.
[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:50.900]  And it's it's a little different than I remembered.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.860]  The little music discs you put in the top.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.640]  There's four of them.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.880]  I didn't remember, but there's a different song on each side.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.220]  So you have it's like a full album.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:01.200]  You have eight songs with this.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:01.860]  That's awesome.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.800]  Isn't it as loud as you remember?
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.320]  No, it's not super loud.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:08.360]  My mom said that this one is not as loud as previous ones.
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.920]  But maybe I'll change the batteries out, maybe get louder or something.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.280]  Anyway, thanks for listening to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:21.880]  This was episode 160 of volume two of season 98.
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:24.940]  Please don't forget it is the summer of 98.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.480]  We don't know what that means, but we are embracing it.
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.180]  Additionally, RTX is coming.
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:32.460]  That's also a summer thing.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:38.580]  And we want you to come out and enjoy it with us here in Austin, Texas, July 7th through the 9th.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:39.700]  That includes the 8th.
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.140]  It's not the 7th comma 9th.
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:42.020]  That would be weird.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.880]  You take the 8th off to rest, I guess, from the party on the 7th.
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.360]  No, we're going to do all three days.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:52.040]  And if you come, you can check out the F*** Face Museum of oddities and things that are things.
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:53.380]  We think that you will like it.
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:59.280]  There's even one very, very, very, very special item that you've got to see it to believe.
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:06.000]  Speaking of seeing stuff, I'd like to see you guys give some rates and reviews on the podcast apps.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:12.160]  I don't know what your preference is, but I know that it has an option for you to rate a podcast to let them know how much you like it.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.700]  It helps us, believe it or not.
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:15.980]  And then also people like words.
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:18.400]  So reviews are also appreciated.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.520]  And that'll do it for this episode.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.940]  Oh, no. F*** Face.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.860]  I didn't. I didn't hit record.
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:28.540]  You're a liar. You're a liar.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:29.880]  I didn't hit record.
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.640]  You're absolutely lying.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:33.340]  You're lying, right?
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:34.760]  Blindside?
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:36.640]  You little prick.
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.420]  Find out!
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.020]  And stop.
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:46.540]  Hey, guys. Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.720]  We're Ericless.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.440]  What does Meat Man look like?
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.520]  Gavin gets yet another nickname.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.980]  The package is on the way.
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.240]  Did Eric meet Stuart?
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.180]  What's the best video game cake?
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:58.820]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.820]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
