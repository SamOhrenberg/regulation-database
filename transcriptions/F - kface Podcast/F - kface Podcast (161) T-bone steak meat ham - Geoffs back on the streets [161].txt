[00:10.600 --> 00:12.280]  Here's what I like about ExpressVPN.
[00:12.500 --> 00:14.300]  I like, as you know, uh...
[00:14.300 --> 00:16.140]  Oh, I didn't tell you, but it's time to start the podcast.
[00:16.320 --> 00:19.060]  Oh, let me give you a quick recap.
[00:19.380 --> 00:20.540]  Also, Gavin was here early.
[00:21.060 --> 00:22.440]  What are you talking about?
[00:22.620 --> 00:23.800]  You were here early this time.
[00:24.420 --> 00:26.320]  Oh, Nick. I love it.
[00:26.500 --> 00:27.460]  Picking up where it left off.
[00:27.900 --> 00:29.720]  Did Eric tell you to keep up the bullshit?
[00:30.280 --> 00:32.620]  No, but this time I actually saw it flip
[00:32.620 --> 00:34.180]  from 59 to 3.
[00:34.700 --> 00:36.600]  Doesn't it infuriate you, Gavin, that everyone
[00:36.600 --> 00:37.680]  else's clock is wrong?
[00:38.320 --> 00:39.720]  You know how, like, people say
[00:39.720 --> 00:41.620]  if you're wrong about something and everyone else...
[00:41.620 --> 00:43.580]  Like, if you have an opinion and everyone else says the opposite,
[00:43.680 --> 00:45.900]  maybe you're wrong? How does it feel to be the reverse?
[00:46.320 --> 00:47.600]  How do I have a GPS
[00:48.120 --> 00:50.040]  satellite clock that's wrong? I just don't...
[00:50.040 --> 00:51.940]  How does that ha... I mean, you might be right.
[00:52.420 --> 00:53.560]  I might need to reevaluate
[00:53.560 --> 00:55.080]  the crystal of this clock.
[00:55.380 --> 00:57.420]  I think we need to get a second GPS satellite clock
[00:57.420 --> 00:59.880]  in the wild. I think we need one of us to get one.
[01:00.020 --> 01:01.420]  Alright, I'm gonna build a second one,
[01:01.520 --> 01:03.140]  and I'll put it straight directly on top.
[01:03.140 --> 01:04.040]  How tough is it to build?
[01:04.600 --> 01:05.880]  Let's all build one.
[01:06.100 --> 01:07.400]  I can build one.
[01:08.120 --> 01:09.640]  Do you have to solder anything?
[01:10.320 --> 01:11.860]  Yeah. I'm out.
[01:12.380 --> 01:13.400]  What, you have to solder?
[01:13.820 --> 01:15.720]  You have to solder, and if you're me,
[01:15.920 --> 01:17.680]  you have to de-solder as well.
[01:18.040 --> 01:20.480]  Can I just Amazon something that's already made?
[01:20.680 --> 01:22.160]  Hey, Nick, do you want to do the intro
[01:22.160 --> 01:22.920]  thing?
[01:23.720 --> 01:25.980]  Oh, yeah! So last time we talked about
[01:25.980 --> 01:27.460]  OG names, Hangman,
[01:27.680 --> 01:29.920]  new strategies, Zoltar
[01:29.920 --> 01:30.980]  changing attire,
[01:32.280 --> 01:33.360]  TV changes,
[01:33.900 --> 01:35.520]  the National Anthem high school song,
[01:35.580 --> 01:37.240]  sponsoring a high school, the school
[01:37.240 --> 01:39.200]  uniform store at the mall, buying a work shirt,
[01:39.560 --> 01:41.040]  fake work, aka furking,
[01:41.400 --> 01:43.180]  marathon hiding crisps, and recreating
[01:43.180 --> 01:44.420]  an old photo.
[01:44.960 --> 01:47.260]  Bunch of grown men just talking about
[01:47.260 --> 01:49.340]  new strategies and sponsoring high
[01:49.340 --> 01:49.760]  schools.
[01:51.040 --> 01:52.220]  Should we kick it off?
[01:52.840 --> 01:55.160]  Yes. Alright, that's my part. I'll do that.
[01:55.780 --> 01:57.620]  Hello and welcome to another episode
[01:57.620 --> 01:59.040]  of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:59.040 --> 02:01.180]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. Folks around
[02:01.180 --> 02:02.760]  these parts call me T-Bone.
[02:02.980 --> 02:05.100]  You can too. And we've
[02:05.100 --> 02:07.080]  assembled a colorful cast of characters for
[02:07.080 --> 02:09.320]  you today. We've got this guy from England.
[02:09.800 --> 02:10.980]  They call him, over there,
[02:11.080 --> 02:12.400]  they call him Whoop Scoop, I think.
[02:12.660 --> 02:14.480]  We've got a Canadian for Vodka Tour.
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.220]  He goes by the name of Johnny Caviar.
[02:17.760 --> 02:19.220]  Watch your wives and girlfriends
[02:19.220 --> 02:21.040]  around Johnny Caviar. That mustache
[02:21.040 --> 02:22.940]  is twisted. And we've got
[02:22.940 --> 02:24.800]  a bog standard, regular guy.
[02:24.880 --> 02:26.700]  We just call him Nick. And
[02:26.700 --> 02:28.720]  usually there's this tiny
[02:28.720 --> 02:30.580]  little gooch of a man named Eric.
[02:30.580 --> 02:31.920]  But he wasn't here this week.
[02:33.100 --> 02:33.860]  We're going
[02:34.580 --> 02:35.440]  goosh-less.
[02:36.040 --> 02:38.180]  For one episode, unfortunately.
[02:38.800 --> 02:40.440]  And that's it. And now
[02:40.440 --> 02:42.480]  we are going to entertain you
[02:42.480 --> 02:43.860]  with our comedic musings.
[02:44.440 --> 02:46.620]  Go! What color
[02:46.620 --> 02:47.220]  is T-Bone?
[02:48.580 --> 02:49.880]  What color is T-Bone?
[02:50.340 --> 02:52.580]  Geoff said we have a colorful
[02:52.580 --> 02:54.500]  cast of characters. Red?
[02:54.500 --> 02:55.880]  Red? You think T-Bone's red?
[02:55.980 --> 02:57.900]  Yeah, like a cartoon T-Bone, right?
[02:58.040 --> 02:59.820]  Like Bugs Bunny T-Bone.
[03:00.020 --> 03:01.600]  Yeah, like a Tom and Jerry.
[03:02.280 --> 03:03.260]  Like a Tom and Jerry.
[03:04.580 --> 03:05.720]  Is medium rare a color?
[03:07.000 --> 03:07.380]  Yeah.
[03:08.120 --> 03:10.340]  Okay. I've
[03:10.340 --> 03:12.120]  only heard it in a state context.
[03:12.240 --> 03:14.080]  I've never seen anyone be like,
[03:14.180 --> 03:15.900]  my walls are painted medium rare.
[03:16.540 --> 03:18.560]  That might be a quirky paint can
[03:18.560 --> 03:19.920]  name. Because
[03:20.480 --> 03:22.580]  nothing's ever dark gray.
[03:22.580 --> 03:24.300]  It's always like cracked pepper.
[03:24.760 --> 03:25.140]  Yeah.
[03:28.160 --> 03:28.920]  Winter storm
[03:28.920 --> 03:29.640]  pepper.
[03:31.700 --> 03:32.460]  Husky pepper.
[03:33.260 --> 03:34.100]  I like husky pepper.
[03:35.140 --> 03:35.900]  Husky pepper?
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.800]  I like a little husky pepper. I want a little husky pepper
[03:38.800 --> 03:40.580]  on my salad, if I'm being honest.
[03:40.680 --> 03:41.340]  That sounds delicious.
[03:42.060 --> 03:44.620]  This is the cartoon representation of
[03:44.620 --> 03:46.740]  T-Bone.
[03:46.840 --> 03:48.220]  This is what I think of when I think of T-Bone.
[03:49.180 --> 03:49.840]  Oh, yeah.
[03:50.380 --> 03:51.900]  It's like a T-Bone steak
[03:51.900 --> 03:53.800]  with legs and it's jacked.
[03:53.800 --> 03:55.640]  He's got muscles. He's flexing his muscles.
[03:55.900 --> 03:57.560]  He's got that perfect V shape.
[03:57.600 --> 03:59.260]  That's the thumbnail, isn't it? That's great.
[03:59.460 --> 04:00.440]  That's a great thumbnail.
[04:00.880 --> 04:03.780]  I don't know what whoop scoop
[04:03.780 --> 04:06.040]  would look like. Oh my god, dude.
[04:06.380 --> 04:07.900]  I just
[04:07.900 --> 04:08.900]  saw another image.
[04:09.820 --> 04:11.780]  I searched for T-Bone cartoon.
[04:12.220 --> 04:13.880]  I don't know why this one came up.
[04:14.080 --> 04:16.220]  But here was next to it.
[04:16.620 --> 04:17.900]  Maybe this is not our intro.
[04:17.900 --> 04:19.380]  So we got the flexing T-Bone.
[04:19.480 --> 04:22.520]  Oh, that's just a man with no skin on his face.
[04:22.560 --> 04:23.880]  That's Bryan Cranston.
[04:24.340 --> 04:25.260]  That's a Bryan...
[04:25.260 --> 04:26.780]  He's got no face.
[04:27.280 --> 04:28.520]  That's Brody says Cranston.
[04:31.300 --> 04:32.720]  He's got bacon lips.
[04:32.960 --> 04:34.420]  He's got eyes for eyes.
[04:35.280 --> 04:35.980]  Eyes for eyes.
[04:36.080 --> 04:37.580]  Eggs for eyes. Jesus Christ.
[04:38.080 --> 04:39.640]  Eyes for eyes. He's got those eyes.
[04:40.180 --> 04:41.560]  The name of this file is
[04:41.560 --> 04:43.500]  T-Bone Steak Meat Ham.
[04:44.860 --> 04:45.620]  So I guess
[04:45.620 --> 04:47.540]  the ham in that man is
[04:47.540 --> 04:49.260]  the meat in that man is ham.
[04:50.120 --> 04:51.100]  I think you should
[04:51.540 --> 04:53.640]  show up at Halloween next year
[04:53.640 --> 04:55.760]  Geoff, as the first one. I think that's an outfit
[04:55.760 --> 04:57.560]  you could do. Just slip in
[04:57.560 --> 04:58.820]  like a mascot uniform.
[04:59.900 --> 05:01.260]  Oh, Nick's put a picture of the
[05:01.260 --> 05:03.540]  whoop scoop. It's a kitty litter scoop.
[05:03.560 --> 05:04.520]  It's just a kitty litter scoop.
[05:05.500 --> 05:06.700]  Yeah, give it like a whoop.
[05:06.860 --> 05:09.540]  Gotta pick that up. I'm not a fan. Kitty make
[05:09.540 --> 05:11.460]  a stinky. I'll be whoop tone.
[05:11.760 --> 05:12.080]  Pffft.
[05:13.840 --> 05:14.340]  Pffft.
[05:14.780 --> 05:15.420]  Is that
[05:16.220 --> 05:17.640]  kitty make a stinky?
[05:18.100 --> 05:20.360]  It's such a shitty catchphrase
[05:20.360 --> 05:21.100]  for whoop scoop.
[05:23.160 --> 05:24.180]  Kitty make a stinky?
[05:24.560 --> 05:26.240]  Yeah. Oh, you kitty make a
[05:26.240 --> 05:27.560]  sticky? Have no fear.
[05:27.940 --> 05:29.600]  Whoop scoop is here.
[05:30.880 --> 05:31.680]  That's terrible.
[05:32.680 --> 05:34.120]  Man, so many of my notes
[05:34.120 --> 05:35.980]  this week are about Eric's
[05:35.980 --> 05:38.160]  bullshit, so I think we'll save that for next time.
[05:38.480 --> 05:40.280]  That's great. You've got a lot of notes about Eric's
[05:40.280 --> 05:42.440]  bullshit. Well, I've got a couple of Eric notes.
[05:43.360 --> 05:44.120]  But yeah, he needs
[05:44.120 --> 05:45.860]  to be around. We've got no Eric this week.
[05:46.240 --> 05:47.520]  I've got a life hack. Oh!
[05:48.020 --> 05:49.400]  I've got an exciting life hack.
[05:49.780 --> 05:52.280]  This is a continuation of a
[05:52.280 --> 05:54.220]  problem we had in the past, and I think I've
[05:54.220 --> 05:56.320]  really innovated here. We talked about
[05:56.320 --> 05:58.200]  before my great AirPod debacle.
[05:58.500 --> 06:00.280]  I found the AirPods and the
[06:00.280 --> 06:02.280]  egg. Yeah, you were trying to charge them
[06:02.280 --> 06:04.200]  in an egg. Yeah, well I wasn't
[06:04.200 --> 06:06.120]  trying to charge them in the egg. I found them in an egg shell.
[06:06.300 --> 06:08.420]  Then I was looking for the charger, and I found the charger
[06:08.420 --> 06:09.820]  but I don't know where the cable is.
[06:10.220 --> 06:12.400]  I don't have a cable to charge it. I actually have a question
[06:12.400 --> 06:14.620]  I didn't ask you last time. Yeah, go ahead.
[06:15.100 --> 06:16.620]  Did you only use them once?
[06:17.520 --> 06:18.500]  I think I
[06:18.500 --> 06:20.440]  used them for 10
[06:20.440 --> 06:21.840]  days, would be my guess.
[06:22.140 --> 06:24.220]  I got them as a Christmas gift
[06:24.220 --> 06:26.400]  from someone, used them for 10
[06:26.400 --> 06:27.980]  days, and then just stopped using them.
[06:28.800 --> 06:30.300]  I think they died, and I just
[06:30.300 --> 06:32.120]  never charged them again. I have a
[06:32.120 --> 06:34.320]  follow-up question to that,
[06:34.440 --> 06:36.340]  but it'll come after you
[06:36.340 --> 06:37.620]  explain what you're explaining.
[06:38.020 --> 06:40.320]  So I haven't been able to
[06:40.320 --> 06:42.340]  find the cable. They've been dead next to
[06:42.340 --> 06:43.920]  my nightstand for several days.
[06:44.560 --> 06:45.960]  I've just given up hope on them.
[06:46.980 --> 06:48.060]  But it was loud
[06:48.060 --> 06:50.240]  one evening. My partner was watching TikToks.
[06:50.300 --> 06:51.380]  I was trying to go to sleep.
[06:52.100 --> 06:54.460]  I didn't want to ruin their entertainment.
[06:55.020 --> 06:55.740]  So I thought, oh,
[06:56.100 --> 06:58.460]  it'd be so nice if my fucking AirPods
[06:58.460 --> 07:00.280]  would work, and I could listen to
[07:00.280 --> 07:02.320]  something. And I thought, well wait
[07:02.320 --> 07:04.080]  a second, I don't need to listen
[07:04.080 --> 07:05.340]  to them. They're earplugs.
[07:05.660 --> 07:07.620]  So I've been using them as earplugs recently,
[07:07.900 --> 07:09.080]  and I've been having a great time.
[07:09.560 --> 07:12.120]  I lay down, pop them in my ears,
[07:12.520 --> 07:13.500]  blocks out the sound,
[07:13.780 --> 07:16.000]  kind of honestly, there's a little bit of a sound that comes
[07:16.000 --> 07:17.600]  with them in your ears that's calming,
[07:17.980 --> 07:20.400]  and I fall asleep every night with them in my ears right now.
[07:20.440 --> 07:22.420]  What do you mean, that sound that comes from them in your ears?
[07:22.800 --> 07:24.040]  There's like a
[07:24.640 --> 07:25.820]  shhhhh. He's like, he's hearing
[07:25.820 --> 07:27.900]  the ocean, like when he puts his ear to a
[07:28.780 --> 07:29.760]  shell at the beach.
[07:29.860 --> 07:31.780]  That is exactly what it is! It's like a
[07:31.780 --> 07:33.780]  very light, ocean-y, when you
[07:33.780 --> 07:35.800]  do the ear thing. So you've got $200
[07:36.340 --> 07:37.580]  earplugs? Well it's,
[07:38.060 --> 07:39.800]  I didn't, listen, I didn't spend the money
[07:39.800 --> 07:41.860]  in that way, I'm just saying it's a life hack. If you need
[07:41.860 --> 07:43.900]  to block out sound, but they're not charged,
[07:43.980 --> 07:45.900]  they still work as things you can put in your ears.
[07:46.060 --> 07:47.820]  Here's an even better life hack. Charge
[07:47.820 --> 07:49.780]  them, and then use the noise cancelling that
[07:49.780 --> 07:51.760]  works even better. Well I'd love the
[07:51.760 --> 07:53.660]  cable. I still need to find the cable, maybe
[07:53.660 --> 07:55.780]  one day we'll get there, but if you don't have a cable,
[07:56.080 --> 07:57.660]  if you're in my scenario,
[07:58.140 --> 07:59.980]  in which you just have dead earpods,
[07:59.980 --> 08:01.900]  just use them as earplugs.
[08:02.760 --> 08:03.600]  Still great!
[08:04.060 --> 08:05.740]  Here's my question, and it ties
[08:05.740 --> 08:07.640]  directly to these airpods.
[08:08.040 --> 08:10.000]  And Gavin, your airpods as well, I assume.
[08:10.680 --> 08:11.880]  I had one of those
[08:11.880 --> 08:14.140]  moments recently, where I realized
[08:14.140 --> 08:15.940]  I think I've been doing something dumb for
[08:15.940 --> 08:17.840]  a really long time, and maybe
[08:17.840 --> 08:20.080]  everybody else figured this out. Andrew's given me hope
[08:20.080 --> 08:21.640]  that not everybody's figured this out.
[08:22.120 --> 08:23.820]  But, um, I
[08:23.820 --> 08:25.960]  love my daughter, she's
[08:25.960 --> 08:28.000]  the best, but she's
[08:28.000 --> 08:29.200]  really, really,
[08:30.060 --> 08:31.880]  really bad on Xbox
[08:31.880 --> 08:34.000]  headsets. Like, she has this
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.100]  ability to break Xbox
[08:36.100 --> 08:38.160]  headsets like nobody's
[08:38.160 --> 08:39.500]  business. I've probably bought her
[08:40.480 --> 08:41.880]  or scavenged from work
[08:41.880 --> 08:44.080]  probably 25 over the course of the time
[08:44.080 --> 08:46.000]  that she's... it's just brutal, right? It's become
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.020]  like a joke. So I won't buy
[08:48.020 --> 08:49.900]  them for her anymore. And what eventually
[08:49.900 --> 08:51.980]  happens is hers will break, and then she'll borrow
[08:51.980 --> 08:54.040]  mine, and then I can't find mine anymore.
[08:54.380 --> 08:55.920]  And then mine will break. Anyway, so I'm at a point
[08:55.920 --> 08:57.940]  now where Diablo 4 came
[08:57.940 --> 08:59.900]  out. If you're not a gamer, it's a popular video
[08:59.900 --> 09:01.920]  game. And Millie and I wanted to start playing
[09:01.920 --> 09:02.840]  Diablo together
[09:04.100 --> 09:05.400]  over Xbox Live.
[09:06.020 --> 09:08.040]  And I realized I didn't have my Xbox
[09:08.040 --> 09:10.020]  headset around, and she was like, just use your
[09:10.020 --> 09:12.060]  AirPods and the Xbox app.
[09:12.220 --> 09:13.920]  And I went, oh, can we do that?
[09:13.960 --> 09:15.920]  And I loaded up the Xbox app on my phone, and
[09:15.920 --> 09:17.960]  I just plugged in my AirPods, and now I've
[09:17.960 --> 09:19.940]  been using that for all of my party chat. And I
[09:19.940 --> 09:22.020]  thought, this is so fucking convenient.
[09:22.580 --> 09:24.060]  It's either brilliant, or
[09:24.060 --> 09:26.020]  something that everybody's been doing for about
[09:26.020 --> 09:27.860]  seven years and that I just clued into.
[09:28.580 --> 09:30.160]  I don't think... I think I've
[09:30.160 --> 09:31.560]  known about it, but I've never done it.
[09:32.960 --> 09:34.340]  It's so great.
[09:34.900 --> 09:35.900]  Why don't I do that?
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.220]  I don't know. It's brilliant, dude.
[09:38.660 --> 09:39.440]  There's no cables.
[09:40.160 --> 09:41.220]  You're not, like,
[09:41.780 --> 09:44.080]  getting excited and unplugging the thing and then trying to
[09:44.080 --> 09:46.160]  fucking plug it back in so you can finish the conversation
[09:46.160 --> 09:48.000]  you were having, which I do at least ten times
[09:48.000 --> 09:48.920]  a session.
[09:50.560 --> 09:51.900]  It's so fucking awesome.
[09:51.900 --> 09:53.680]  And I just... I don't know why it never
[09:53.680 --> 09:56.020]  crossed my mind that that was a feature
[09:56.020 --> 09:57.840]  that I could be taking advantage of.
[09:58.280 --> 09:59.680]  And I feel just dumb
[09:59.680 --> 10:00.960]  that I haven't been doing it.
[10:01.800 --> 10:02.900]  Have you been playing Diablo?
[10:04.220 --> 10:05.720]  Uh, yeah. We've been playing a little bit.
[10:05.840 --> 10:07.860]  I mean, about as much as we play. We'll play for like an hour
[10:07.860 --> 10:09.620]  at a time, maybe twice, three times a week.
[10:09.920 --> 10:10.740]  What do you think of it?
[10:11.840 --> 10:13.260]  It's Diablo. I don't know.
[10:13.480 --> 10:15.420]  I mean, I like it.
[10:15.820 --> 10:17.180]  Am I not supposed to like it? Do you not like it?
[10:17.300 --> 10:19.840]  No! I have an issue with it,
[10:19.840 --> 10:21.420]  and I don't know if it's just I'm playing wrong.
[10:21.800 --> 10:23.780]  It takes me 30,000 button
[10:23.780 --> 10:25.120]  presses to kill any boss.
[10:25.680 --> 10:27.020]  And my hands get really sore.
[10:27.320 --> 10:29.020]  And I have a squishy character. I just don't...
[10:29.020 --> 10:31.220]  I feel like I'm playing the game wrong
[10:31.220 --> 10:32.460]  because it's impossible.
[10:33.760 --> 10:35.780]  I just don't get it. I don't understand how people
[10:35.780 --> 10:36.280]  are having fun.
[10:36.880 --> 10:39.780]  I definitely have to press a lot of buttons, but I think it's because I'm doing
[10:39.780 --> 10:41.940]  stuff... I'm doing something in a purposefully dumb
[10:41.940 --> 10:43.760]  way. I'm leveling up my
[10:43.760 --> 10:45.820]  character where I only picked one attack.
[10:46.360 --> 10:47.620]  I only have one attack.
[10:47.620 --> 10:49.640]  And then every time I level, I just
[10:49.640 --> 10:51.340]  level up a passive ability.
[10:52.020 --> 10:53.660]  That's great. So, I'm just gonna see how
[10:53.660 --> 10:55.680]  far into the game I can get
[10:55.680 --> 10:57.620]  with the one X attack
[10:57.620 --> 10:59.700]  that I was initially given when I started
[10:59.700 --> 11:01.780]  the game. And then just everything else I level
[11:01.780 --> 11:03.820]  is passive. That's fantastic.
[11:04.320 --> 11:05.700]  Nick says, when do you get to use the long
[11:05.700 --> 11:07.680]  thumbsticks? I think it would help more in
[11:07.680 --> 11:08.180]  Diablo 4.
[11:09.780 --> 11:10.700]  Hmm. I have an update.
[11:12.220 --> 11:13.300]  Oh! What's the update?
[11:14.400 --> 11:16.000]  Oh my god!
[11:16.500 --> 11:18.140]  It's gonna deliver on my birthday!
[11:19.200 --> 11:20.140]  On Geoff's birthday.
[11:20.960 --> 11:22.140]  Oh! That's awesome.
[11:22.420 --> 11:23.640]  I gotta keep my eyes open.
[11:23.820 --> 11:25.440]  Are you gonna be in? What do you mean?
[11:26.260 --> 11:27.980]  Never mind. I'm gonna be home to receive
[11:27.980 --> 11:30.160]  the package. Will I be? Why wouldn't
[11:30.160 --> 11:30.480]  I be?
[11:32.760 --> 11:33.780]  Why would I be?
[11:33.780 --> 11:34.580]  You might have gone out.
[11:35.900 --> 11:37.800]  The whole day? On Geoff's birthday?
[11:37.960 --> 11:39.340]  No, I stay home for Geoff's birthday.
[11:40.040 --> 11:41.960]  I get myself a cake. I throw a little
[11:41.960 --> 11:44.140]  party. Shut up. Every year.
[11:44.140 --> 11:45.360]  It's my yearly tradition.
[11:46.680 --> 11:48.320]  What are you doing for Geoff's
[11:48.320 --> 11:49.960]  birthday, Gavin? Hanging out.
[11:50.220 --> 11:52.020]  Hanging out? Yeah? Your place?
[11:52.420 --> 11:54.380]  Where you going? Geoff's place?
[11:54.620 --> 11:55.440]  We're going somewhere.
[11:56.160 --> 11:58.100]  Oh! We're taking a little trip.
[11:58.140 --> 11:58.660]  You guys are doing something.
[12:00.580 --> 12:02.180]  We're leaving tomorrow morning.
[12:02.480 --> 12:04.180]  I mean, I don't know what Gavin's travel schedule is,
[12:04.240 --> 12:06.080]  but we're gonna go up to Dallas for the weekend
[12:06.080 --> 12:08.080]  and we're gonna go to medieval tunnels.
[12:09.840 --> 12:10.820]  You're going to medieval tunnels?
[12:10.820 --> 12:12.340]  I will say, it's a way less convenient
[12:12.340 --> 12:14.360]  birthday than mine was, but I'll be there.
[12:15.080 --> 12:16.500]  Yeah, it's incredibly...
[12:16.500 --> 12:18.320]  And by the way, it wasn't... I didn't pick it.
[12:18.420 --> 12:20.560]  Emily was like, you wanna go out of town for your birthday? And I was like, yeah.
[12:20.980 --> 12:22.340]  She was like, let's just do... She wanted to go to
[12:22.340 --> 12:24.260]  Vegas and I was trying to save money for the wedding
[12:24.260 --> 12:26.360]  and stuff. And so she was like, why don't we just drive up to Dallas
[12:26.360 --> 12:28.340]  for the weekend and do Dallas shit? And I was like, yeah,
[12:28.340 --> 12:30.260]  okay. And then she's like, do you want your friends
[12:30.260 --> 12:32.420]  to come? And I thought, no, it would be inconvenient
[12:32.420 --> 12:34.280]  for them to come out of town. And she goes,
[12:34.640 --> 12:35.980]  they'll be happy to do it.
[12:36.160 --> 12:38.280]  And I thought, okay, we'll find out. It's both. I'm happy
[12:38.280 --> 12:40.000]  to do it. It's inconvenient. I'll be there.
[12:43.640 --> 12:44.580]  We're gonna go horse.
[12:44.680 --> 12:46.720]  We're gonna go to the horse races too. I'm excited.
[12:47.960 --> 12:49.080]  Oh, that's awesome.
[12:49.280 --> 12:49.680]  Yeah.
[12:50.780 --> 12:53.100]  Like, is it staged horse racing
[12:53.100 --> 12:55.000]  for Medieval Times? Like, what type of horse racing?
[12:55.340 --> 12:56.380]  No, they're separate events.
[12:57.160 --> 12:58.780]  Okay. There's a horse track
[12:58.780 --> 13:01.060]  and a Medieval Times. Those are just the two things we're doing.
[13:01.240 --> 13:03.000]  Oh, I see. I thought Medieval Times
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.200]  do horse racing. Like, it's wrestling? Like, they tell which horse to
[13:05.200 --> 13:06.120]  do what?
[13:06.600 --> 13:09.060]  Well, yeah. I feel like the only time I've seen Medieval Times
[13:09.060 --> 13:09.980]  is in movies where they do horse racing.
[13:09.980 --> 13:12.190]  They do, like, the fake fights with the Harlem Globetrotters
[13:12.820 --> 13:14.100]  of night fights type thing.
[13:14.260 --> 13:15.260]  Yeah, it's like this guy in the background.
[13:15.880 --> 13:18.360]  Tell the Perseron to take a dive in the third leg.
[13:19.080 --> 13:19.160]  Yeah.
[13:20.120 --> 13:21.980]  It is difficult. Yeah, with horses
[13:21.980 --> 13:22.860]  I don't know how that'd work.
[13:23.220 --> 13:26.300]  Suddenly the Bruce Willis of horses is jumping out of a window.
[13:26.920 --> 13:27.280]  Yeah.
[13:29.240 --> 13:30.420]  Tell Rainbow Connection
[13:30.420 --> 13:32.220]  he needs to slow down in the third act.
[13:32.280 --> 13:33.560]  Okay? The third turn.
[13:36.240 --> 13:37.360]  He cannot win.
[13:38.300 --> 13:39.000]  That's fun.
[13:39.100 --> 13:41.420]  That's great. I need to adjust some of my stuff then.
[13:41.660 --> 13:43.020]  I'm going to be in Dallas.
[13:43.920 --> 13:45.200]  Just tomorrow and Saturday.
[13:45.340 --> 13:46.480]  I think I'll be home Saturday or Sunday.
[13:47.520 --> 13:48.080]  Oh, okay.
[13:48.760 --> 13:50.560]  When is your birthday? It's Tuesday. Monday.
[13:50.840 --> 13:51.540]  It's not till next Monday.
[13:52.620 --> 13:55.340]  It's the day you're getting your big controller
[13:55.340 --> 13:57.440]  sticks, buddy. Ah, shit. I'm going to be out
[13:57.440 --> 13:57.860]  that day.
[14:00.620 --> 14:01.340]  No, that's
[14:01.340 --> 14:03.160]  the day you stay home and bake a cake
[14:03.160 --> 14:04.180]  and celebrate your birthday.
[14:04.180 --> 14:05.820]  Chase down the fucking chip order.
[14:06.240 --> 14:07.360]  We're getting chips.
[14:08.100 --> 14:10.460]  Eric hasn't sent me the 40, but we're getting sent those.
[14:11.480 --> 14:12.280]  I'm concerned
[14:12.280 --> 14:14.260]  about some of you guys' chip choices and the fact
[14:14.260 --> 14:16.160]  that he had to order like 40 bag
[14:16.160 --> 14:18.040]  bundles for me. So I'm just going to have
[14:18.040 --> 14:19.860]  so many potentially terrible chips.
[14:20.220 --> 14:22.360]  I mean, if they're from my list, you're in for a treat.
[14:22.500 --> 14:24.260]  Same. We're picking the best of
[14:24.260 --> 14:26.080]  the best. Yeah, these are the top.
[14:26.400 --> 14:27.940]  And I talked about this last time.
[14:27.980 --> 14:29.880]  I really struggled. So many are good.
[14:30.060 --> 14:30.780]  Same. Same.
[14:31.400 --> 14:32.940]  I can't believe you didn't put
[14:32.940 --> 14:34.480]  Build-A-Snack on your list.
[14:35.220 --> 14:36.860]  Yeah, the old Transformer snack.
[14:37.060 --> 14:39.060]  It's just not top tier.
[14:39.140 --> 14:41.120]  It's probably B tier if I was doing this.
[14:41.240 --> 14:42.140]  And I've just gone for A.
[14:43.100 --> 14:44.440]  It is a gimmicky snack.
[14:44.780 --> 14:47.020]  Unfortunately for Gavin, all my chips are S tier.
[14:48.340 --> 14:48.940]  Alright, there's
[14:48.940 --> 14:50.740]  S above A. Ah, shit. That's a good point.
[14:55.680 --> 14:57.500]  We're trying to speedrun Resident Evil 7.
[14:59.360 --> 15:00.300]  I feel like
[15:00.300 --> 15:02.100]  we've been at it
[15:02.100 --> 15:03.600]  recently in terms of logistics.
[15:04.180 --> 15:05.820]  We've got chips
[15:05.820 --> 15:07.980]  moving across the world. We've got thumbsticks.
[15:08.320 --> 15:09.740]  Stuff's getting ordered. Stuff's getting
[15:09.740 --> 15:11.600]  delivered. A bunch of stuff.
[15:11.780 --> 15:13.760]  We did the port-a-potty
[15:13.760 --> 15:15.820]  thing yesterday. Dude, we filmed
[15:16.340 --> 15:18.020]  three pieces of supplemental
[15:18.020 --> 15:19.240]  content yesterday.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.900]  And I'm really excited about it too
[15:21.900 --> 15:23.700]  because we had that run where we were releasing
[15:23.700 --> 15:25.900]  supplemental content. I think we did like five weeks
[15:25.900 --> 15:28.020]  in a row. And then we kind of ran through
[15:28.020 --> 15:30.000]  it all. Although I just realized we're releasing
[15:31.280 --> 15:31.760]  the
[15:31.760 --> 15:32.760]  Blindside episode.
[15:33.680 --> 15:35.860]  Have you guys been looking
[15:35.860 --> 15:38.100]  at your work calendar and laughing every time
[15:38.100 --> 15:39.880]  you come across it? Because it has killed
[15:39.880 --> 15:41.220]  me several times.
[15:42.820 --> 15:44.020]  I watched it today.
[15:44.200 --> 15:45.980]  Oh, man. Oh, that's great.
[15:46.180 --> 15:47.480]  I might do that.
[15:47.960 --> 15:50.000]  Just in my calendar, Blindside
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.100]  aids first, 7-8am.
[15:52.100 --> 15:53.780]  I want to see it.
[15:55.220 --> 15:56.200]  Blindside aids public
[15:56.200 --> 15:57.640]  the next day, 7-8am.
[16:01.120 --> 16:04.200]  We're not calling it Blindside aids,
[16:04.280 --> 16:04.480]  are we?
[16:05.440 --> 16:07.940]  I don't know what we're calling it. That's probably internal.
[16:08.380 --> 16:08.860]  Oh, okay.
[16:10.280 --> 16:12.040]  I mean, it definitely helped. We definitely know
[16:12.040 --> 16:12.480]  what that is.
[16:13.520 --> 16:16.060]  And I meant to run this by you guys. I think it would be fun
[16:16.060 --> 16:17.980]  if whoever conducted the Blindside gets
[16:17.980 --> 16:19.940]  to name whatever it's called. Oh, yeah.
[16:19.940 --> 16:21.620]  I think that's the...
[16:21.620 --> 16:22.980]  We're trying to figure out how to name it.
[16:23.540 --> 16:24.900]  A very special Blindside.
[16:26.180 --> 16:27.540]  Because I like the idea of
[16:27.540 --> 16:29.320]  us releasing...
[16:29.320 --> 16:31.520]  We were talking about what...
[16:31.520 --> 16:33.880]  Not to spoil a sausage talk,
[16:33.960 --> 16:35.500]  but we had kind of a conversation about
[16:35.500 --> 16:37.840]  what is and isn't in the f*** face
[16:37.840 --> 16:39.320]  umbrella as far as shows go.
[16:40.120 --> 16:41.600]  And I've been thinking about that quite a bit
[16:41.600 --> 16:43.920]  since we had that talk. I like the idea of us
[16:43.920 --> 16:45.500]  releasing a
[16:45.500 --> 16:47.920]  20-minute thing only about
[16:47.920 --> 16:49.280]  lenses, specifically
[16:49.860 --> 16:51.840]  about lenses. And anyone who
[16:51.840 --> 16:54.300]  saw on the schedule would be like, that's a Blindside.
[16:54.660 --> 16:56.440]  They're definitely throwing a Blindside there.
[16:56.760 --> 16:57.420]  We could
[16:57.420 --> 17:00.000]  blindside the audience by just making
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  content that they would not necessarily anticipate
[17:02.000 --> 17:03.540]  as our content.
[17:04.440 --> 17:05.980]  I think there's avenues to
[17:05.980 --> 17:07.060]  explore in that way.
[17:07.500 --> 17:09.820]  What if we all are tasked with a 10-minute
[17:09.820 --> 17:11.520]  solo podcast about lenses?
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.180]  That sounds great.
[17:14.660 --> 17:15.900]  I'll gladly do two.
[17:16.440 --> 17:18.180]  You've also inadvertently
[17:18.180 --> 17:20.100]  just given me an idea for a whole
[17:20.100 --> 17:21.680]  different Blindside direction.
[17:22.000 --> 17:23.520]  Maybe next time.
[17:23.700 --> 17:25.360]  I have number two in the can,
[17:25.880 --> 17:27.380]  but you just gave me number three.
[17:28.100 --> 17:28.540]  Oh, God.
[17:29.200 --> 17:32.020]  Can you imagine how annoyed Eric would be if we told him
[17:32.020 --> 17:33.460]  that this was a Blindside recording?
[17:35.520 --> 17:37.220]  We didn't make one, we just did a Blindside.
[17:38.300 --> 17:39.060]  Oh, shit!
[17:39.340 --> 17:42.180]  Is this episode 161? I didn't even say it.
[17:42.260 --> 17:42.840]  Oh, yeah!
[17:43.720 --> 17:44.600]  Is that right, Nick?
[17:44.780 --> 17:45.200]  That's right.
[17:46.060 --> 17:48.880]  Are you in the mask? No, I'm not in the mask.
[17:49.060 --> 17:50.800]  God damn it! Did I just blow my ass?
[17:50.940 --> 17:51.840]  No, next year.
[17:52.760 --> 17:53.440]  That's next year.
[17:54.460 --> 17:55.220]  It's already won.
[17:56.340 --> 17:57.420]  You might have been practicing.
[17:59.940 --> 18:01.220]  I'm a theory.
[18:02.060 --> 18:02.300]  Okay.
[18:03.900 --> 18:04.960]  And because of that,
[18:05.000 --> 18:05.460]  I have a clip.
[18:07.220 --> 18:07.600]  Okay.
[18:08.380 --> 18:10.820]  These have typically been against me, but recently
[18:10.820 --> 18:12.400]  not, so I'm excited about this clip.
[18:12.680 --> 18:14.420]  Gavin clips are always entertaining.
[18:14.820 --> 18:16.120]  My theory is this.
[18:17.440 --> 18:18.680]  Whoever edits
[18:18.680 --> 18:20.380]  is reusing projects.
[18:22.000 --> 18:22.180]  And
[18:22.800 --> 18:24.100]  you may have noticed that
[18:24.100 --> 18:25.820]  in a previous episode,
[18:26.560 --> 18:29.000]  Andrew hit us with Johnny Caviar
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.080]  about 44 minutes into an episode.
[18:31.560 --> 18:32.100]  Check this out.
[18:32.880 --> 18:33.340]  Bird chirp.
[18:34.620 --> 18:36.200]  I'm playing it.
[18:36.200 --> 18:36.860]  Bird chirp.
[18:38.800 --> 18:39.300]  Bird chirp.
[18:40.520 --> 18:41.040]  You...
[18:42.820 --> 18:44.360]  We all remember that.
[18:44.640 --> 18:45.680]  Yeah, you got Caviar.
[18:45.900 --> 18:47.060]  That was great. Now, interestingly,
[18:47.580 --> 18:50.320]  when I was proofing the next episode
[18:50.320 --> 18:52.400]  at exactly 44 minutes...
[18:53.460 --> 18:54.380]  But what I did find,
[18:54.500 --> 18:55.860]  which isn't exactly a movie prop,
[18:56.240 --> 18:57.460]  but it's congregate related,
[18:57.700 --> 18:59.260]  is I found on eBay
[19:02.020 --> 19:02.540]  this...
[19:02.540 --> 19:04.660]  Now I think we have some bleed over.
[19:04.660 --> 19:05.760]  I think someone...
[19:05.760 --> 19:08.660]  Somebody deleted the track but left that.
[19:10.260 --> 19:11.100]  Even Nick or Kelly
[19:11.100 --> 19:12.440]  has just plopped the next
[19:12.440 --> 19:14.200]  episode into a track.
[19:14.880 --> 19:15.900]  But all the additional
[19:17.940 --> 19:18.820]  farts are still
[19:18.820 --> 19:19.180]  on there.
[19:21.800 --> 19:22.680]  I mean, obviously
[19:22.680 --> 19:24.300]  that's why we proof, isn't it?
[19:24.380 --> 19:25.580]  That's what we look out for.
[19:27.040 --> 19:28.740]  But I'll be honest, when I was
[19:29.460 --> 19:30.760]  proofing that earlier today
[19:32.140 --> 19:32.880]  and I was
[19:32.880 --> 19:34.660]  emptying the dishwasher, it scared
[19:34.660 --> 19:36.800]  the shit out of me. I didn't know what was
[19:36.800 --> 19:37.120]  happening.
[19:38.500 --> 19:40.100]  I almost want to leave.
[19:44.400 --> 19:46.340]  Did you think it was a ghost fart?
[19:47.060 --> 19:47.960]  I was like,
[19:48.660 --> 19:50.580]  what's happened? Have my
[19:50.580 --> 19:52.360]  AirPods paired to something else?
[19:53.440 --> 19:54.780]  How long did it take you
[19:54.780 --> 19:56.620]  to realize it was the previous fart?
[19:57.060 --> 19:58.700]  Well, I just rewound it and it happened again.
[19:58.820 --> 20:00.040]  So I was like, oh, it's baked in.
[20:00.040 --> 20:02.200]  But I was very shocked and very
[20:02.200 --> 20:04.100]  confused. Do you think
[20:04.100 --> 20:06.060]  that fart should just be at 44
[20:06.060 --> 20:07.480]  minutes for every episode?
[20:08.000 --> 20:09.880]  No, it shouldn't!
[20:10.300 --> 20:11.740]  I love the fact that it just
[20:11.740 --> 20:14.280]  infected future episodes. It just blasted
[20:14.280 --> 20:16.220]  through time into the next
[20:16.220 --> 20:17.860]  episode. How about this?
[20:18.820 --> 20:20.380]  He farted on two episodes.
[20:20.780 --> 20:22.120]  It was such a
[20:22.120 --> 20:22.780]  stealth fart.
[20:23.240 --> 20:25.820]  I can't detect it.
[20:26.040 --> 20:28.280]  You farted your way into every recording
[20:28.280 --> 20:30.400]  going forward. Johnny Caviar
[20:30.400 --> 20:32.080]  has much greater reach than I thought.
[20:34.400 --> 20:36.560]  Staying power, clearly with Johnny Caviar.
[20:36.980 --> 20:38.280]  I mean, I don't think we should
[20:39.220 --> 20:40.220]  cut it.
[20:40.360 --> 20:42.360]  But it will live on
[20:42.360 --> 20:43.900]  in this episode.
[20:44.060 --> 20:46.200]  What if once a year
[20:46.200 --> 20:48.380]  Nick gets to try to... I love these once a year
[20:48.380 --> 20:50.260]  things. What if once a year Nick
[20:50.260 --> 20:52.180]  gets to try to slip it past us at
[20:52.180 --> 20:54.300]  44 minutes and if he does,
[20:54.700 --> 20:56.500]  the first person who lets us know
[20:56.500 --> 20:58.000]  wins a free t-shirt or something.
[20:58.400 --> 21:00.440]  It's just like testing whether we're proofing or not.
[21:00.820 --> 21:01.020]  Yeah.
[21:02.200 --> 21:04.520]  Every once in a while Nick will try to slip that fart in.
[21:07.800 --> 21:09.900]  If you want, I can give you more material.
[21:10.100 --> 21:12.380]  Just let me know. I can give you a new one.
[21:12.760 --> 21:13.580]  We're not restricted.
[21:14.180 --> 21:16.440]  I love Johnny Caviar's voice. It's slightly
[21:16.440 --> 21:16.880]  different.
[21:17.940 --> 21:19.980]  It's a little more aggressive.
[21:20.280 --> 21:21.100]  It's a little bit more aggressive.
[21:22.380 --> 21:24.180]  Yeah, it's a little east, a little confident.
[21:24.180 --> 21:25.960]  I was wondering
[21:25.960 --> 21:28.260]  because immediately you start, within a span of
[21:28.260 --> 21:29.380]  three seconds, I'm thinking
[21:29.380 --> 21:32.120]  did my AirPods go to my iPad
[21:32.120 --> 21:34.400]  or something or did Andrew actually
[21:34.400 --> 21:36.320]  fart into the mic again and we just didn't
[21:36.320 --> 21:38.360]  notice? You're just immediately thinking of all this stuff
[21:38.360 --> 21:40.520]  but it was just the same
[21:40.520 --> 21:41.660]  exact fart.
[21:42.220 --> 21:44.320]  You know what would have solved that problem? Your AirPods?
[21:44.700 --> 21:46.320]  If they were dead and you were using
[21:46.320 --> 21:48.080]  them as earplugs, that would have been an issue.
[21:49.440 --> 21:50.320]  Problem solved.
[21:52.360 --> 21:53.480]  Way better solution.
[21:53.960 --> 21:55.020]  So, uh,
[21:55.460 --> 21:56.200]  Nick O'Kelly.
[21:56.560 --> 21:58.060]  That would be Kelly, I assume.
[21:58.580 --> 22:00.700]  Oh, Nick throwing
[22:00.700 --> 22:01.960]  Kelly under the bus.
[22:03.640 --> 22:04.600]  Well, you know what?
[22:04.620 --> 22:06.340]  He did it in a good way, though.
[22:06.380 --> 22:08.240]  He said, I assume, he gave some wiggle room.
[22:08.580 --> 22:10.620]  Nick just threw Kelly under the bus
[22:10.620 --> 22:12.220]  like he threw that dragon fruit yesterday.
[22:13.260 --> 22:15.160]  Oh, did the dragon fruit...
[22:15.160 --> 22:16.320]  Was it a good one?
[22:16.860 --> 22:18.340]  How did the dragon fruit... So you guys
[22:18.340 --> 22:20.220]  filmed... We should just loop back on this.
[22:20.340 --> 22:22.260]  I sadly miss this. It's always...
[22:22.260 --> 22:24.320]  It's a weird thing where it's like, oh, I wish I could
[22:24.320 --> 22:26.320]  be there, but it also makes me so happy knowing these things
[22:26.320 --> 22:28.200]  are happening. You guys were
[22:28.200 --> 22:30.500]  testing the most throwable fruit
[22:31.440 --> 22:31.840]  yesterday.
[22:31.920 --> 22:34.380]  We filmed three supplemental pieces
[22:34.380 --> 22:36.380]  yesterday. We filmed Sausage Talk episode three
[22:36.380 --> 22:38.420]  which includes a lot of
[22:38.420 --> 22:40.100]  literal talk about sausage at the beginning
[22:40.100 --> 22:42.280]  until Eric shut us up, which I was bummed out
[22:42.280 --> 22:44.760]  because I thought we were really cranking
[22:44.760 --> 22:46.320]  on our direction there. I want to get
[22:46.320 --> 22:48.180]  back to that someday. It's also very
[22:48.180 --> 22:50.420]  dry talk about merch and how
[22:50.420 --> 22:51.900]  shows get made and pitched.
[22:52.600 --> 22:54.320]  Then we picked...
[22:54.860 --> 22:56.440]  Went to the grocery store together, which I'm...
[22:57.020 --> 22:58.440]  By the way, this is now the third time
[22:58.440 --> 23:00.220]  I've gone to the grocery store with F***Face
[23:00.220 --> 23:02.540]  or for F***Face. And I gotta say
[23:03.500 --> 23:04.460]  F***Face field trips
[23:04.460 --> 23:06.600]  to the grocery store are just a lot of fun.
[23:06.660 --> 23:08.400]  Any excuse
[23:08.400 --> 23:10.000]  we have to shop together.
[23:10.720 --> 23:12.300]  Anyway, so we picked out our fruit and then
[23:12.300 --> 23:14.240]  we had our fruit throwing contest
[23:14.240 --> 23:15.520]  and then after that
[23:17.520 --> 23:18.320]  we attempted
[23:18.320 --> 23:20.220]  to do the thing that Eric definitely
[23:20.220 --> 23:22.380]  did not want to do. And I gotta be honest
[23:22.380 --> 23:24.060]  with you, I understand why now.
[23:25.060 --> 23:26.280]  We opened up the
[23:26.280 --> 23:28.400]  surstromming in the porta potty
[23:29.220 --> 23:30.360]  and tested my
[23:30.360 --> 23:32.240]  nose flaps. So we won't talk about
[23:32.240 --> 23:34.460]  the results because I want to edit those videos
[23:34.460 --> 23:36.420]  and then Andrew's gonna react, right?
[23:36.520 --> 23:37.820]  Is that the plan? Yeah.
[23:38.100 --> 23:40.200]  Andrew needs to see... I figured it would be
[23:40.200 --> 23:42.280]  like the bean hole thing where you showed me like a clip
[23:42.280 --> 23:44.380]  on the show and it was like a tease for the
[23:44.380 --> 23:46.360]  video that was coming. Maybe I'll do that next time
[23:46.360 --> 23:47.840]  Eric's back. Sounds great.
[23:48.780 --> 23:50.160]  It was a great
[23:50.160 --> 23:52.260]  very sweaty day. I actually whipped
[23:52.260 --> 23:54.120]  out Stuart for maybe
[23:54.120 --> 23:56.020]  35 seconds at H-E-B
[23:56.020 --> 23:58.380]  and Eric was
[23:59.280 --> 24:00.320]  extremely unhappy.
[24:00.740 --> 24:01.860]  Yeah, that checks.
[24:02.240 --> 24:03.560]  Eric immediately was like
[24:04.060 --> 24:06.240]  get away from me. I gotta get away from
[24:06.240 --> 24:08.200]  this guy. He did not
[24:08.200 --> 24:10.360]  like Stuart and Stuart clearly liked
[24:10.360 --> 24:12.440]  him. All I did was just sort of like
[24:12.440 --> 24:14.300]  knock into some hanging avocado
[24:14.300 --> 24:16.500]  bags and then instead of pulling one
[24:17.160 --> 24:18.220]  bag to like weigh
[24:18.220 --> 24:20.220]  loose veg, I pulled like two
[24:20.800 --> 24:22.360]  or three and Eric
[24:22.360 --> 24:24.460]  was just like this sucks and he just tried to get away
[24:24.460 --> 24:26.320]  from me. I didn't do anything else.
[24:26.540 --> 24:28.240]  I just started like standing
[24:28.240 --> 24:30.220]  next to him and like lifting
[24:30.220 --> 24:32.200]  up my hands and looking at stuff
[24:32.200 --> 24:34.280]  and he was like, oh, I didn't even have to do
[24:34.280 --> 24:36.240]  anything. I was just getting too excited
[24:36.240 --> 24:37.520]  and I ended up
[24:38.440 --> 24:39.600]  like not even picking
[24:39.600 --> 24:41.580]  anything else up. It was just his reaction was what
[24:41.580 --> 24:43.580]  made it. Stuart is clearly
[24:43.580 --> 24:45.480]  his nails on a chalkboard. It was
[24:45.480 --> 24:47.500]  great to watch. Yeah, we
[24:47.500 --> 24:49.560]  should try. We didn't film in there just because it's like
[24:49.560 --> 24:51.080]  in public. Well,
[24:51.460 --> 24:53.120]  I tried to film.
[24:54.020 --> 24:54.920]  Oh, you did? Did you get any?
[24:55.220 --> 24:56.940]  No, remember I didn't hit the button.
[24:57.880 --> 24:58.560]  I thought I filmed.
[24:59.240 --> 25:01.460]  I thought I filmed like the first three minutes and I didn't.
[25:01.660 --> 25:03.600]  Geoff, Geoff, he did like this nice intro
[25:03.600 --> 25:05.740]  he was panning across us, he was asking us questions
[25:05.740 --> 25:07.180]  and about a minute into that
[25:07.960 --> 25:09.380]  he's like, oh, I wasn't recording.
[25:09.760 --> 25:10.500]  Oh no!
[25:12.280 --> 25:13.740]  I wish it would have been like
[25:13.740 --> 25:15.760]  the reverse Bronson, like the
[25:15.760 --> 25:17.780]  action Bronson scenario again where all you have is
[25:17.780 --> 25:19.560]  footage of you guys walking out of the store.
[25:19.660 --> 25:20.580]  That would be nice.
[25:21.480 --> 25:22.660]  It'd be nice to have any footage.
[25:23.520 --> 25:25.020]  I handed off my phone
[25:25.020 --> 25:27.440]  to help us film the throwing. I handed it off to Jack
[25:27.440 --> 25:30.040]  and then I handed it off to Eric at one point during the
[25:30.040 --> 25:31.700]  strumming and I don't know
[25:31.700 --> 25:33.640]  who's responsible, but I have like
[25:34.180 --> 25:34.580]  twenty
[25:35.880 --> 25:37.840]  two second clips of just pink
[25:37.840 --> 25:39.640]  and purple. That's gotta be Jack,
[25:39.740 --> 25:41.920]  right? That's like a Jack thing.
[25:42.400 --> 25:43.680]  Yeah, I'll put that in just for the
[25:44.260 --> 25:45.620]  audience so they can see in the video
[25:45.620 --> 25:47.020]  version. But yeah, it's just a complete
[25:47.800 --> 25:49.600]  weird mess. Have you looked at the clips?
[25:50.140 --> 25:51.760]  Uh, let me look at one. We haven't looked
[25:51.760 --> 25:53.540]  at them? This one's twelve
[25:54.120 --> 25:55.740]  seconds. I bet it's
[25:55.740 --> 25:56.960]  just twelve seconds of Jack's dick.
[25:57.600 --> 25:58.560]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[25:59.480 --> 26:00.120]  Geoff's sound.
[26:01.780 --> 26:02.600]  Imagine if this was my
[26:02.600 --> 26:03.560]  forty-fourth second fart.
[26:04.700 --> 26:06.820]  That'd be amazing if we could get that on his phone.
[26:07.360 --> 26:08.120]  Yeah, I think it's
[26:09.020 --> 26:09.880]  Jack's pocket.
[26:11.380 --> 26:12.640]  Do you think Jack just
[26:12.640 --> 26:14.400]  farted like... I told you it was his dick!
[26:14.860 --> 26:15.260]  I was right.
[26:18.800 --> 26:19.620]  Is this hitting
[26:19.620 --> 26:22.000]  stop and start randomly in his pocket?
[26:22.620 --> 26:24.520]  Yeah, he must have. Yeah, that's great.
[26:25.880 --> 26:26.560]  He was probably
[26:26.560 --> 26:28.460]  getting and losing an erection over and over again
[26:28.460 --> 26:30.360]  Was he wearing
[26:30.360 --> 26:31.600]  pink or purple shorts?
[26:34.200 --> 26:35.000]  He was...
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.580]  There has to be a photo or video.
[26:37.080 --> 26:38.380]  What was he wearing? He was wearing
[26:38.380 --> 26:40.520]  shorts. We can figure this
[26:40.520 --> 26:40.820]  out.
[26:42.360 --> 26:44.220]  Get a t-shirt on. This is a case that can be solved.
[26:45.280 --> 26:46.600]  Probably blue or green
[26:46.600 --> 26:48.100]  or brown or...
[26:48.100 --> 26:49.460]  Yeah, so anyway, that's my camera roll.
[26:49.840 --> 26:51.800]  That's a lot of pocket, it appears.
[26:53.360 --> 26:54.540]  Um, no spoilers.
[26:55.240 --> 26:56.560]  I was asked to pick a fruit.
[26:56.560 --> 26:57.700]  I said dragon fruit.
[26:57.940 --> 27:00.680]  Could you give me a noise on how it went?
[27:00.820 --> 27:01.900]  Should I be happy about it?
[27:02.820 --> 27:03.780]  Did it go well?
[27:04.080 --> 27:06.020]  No, dude. We're not going to give you any kind of information.
[27:06.540 --> 27:08.740]  I don't want to color your opinion
[27:08.740 --> 27:11.260]  on the video. We want you to see it for the first time.
[27:11.800 --> 27:13.300]  Listen, I'm already a colorful character.
[27:13.800 --> 27:15.080]  I could use some more color.
[27:15.620 --> 27:16.220]  It's not going to hurt.
[27:17.880 --> 27:18.560]  I mean...
[27:18.560 --> 27:20.500]  How do you think a dragon fruit went?
[27:20.940 --> 27:22.340]  Well, I picked it, so I thought
[27:22.740 --> 27:24.060]  it would go pretty well.
[27:24.060 --> 27:25.740]  Then I looked at photos later and I thought
[27:25.740 --> 27:27.720]  that feels like it could really go.
[27:27.940 --> 27:29.120]  It might be too heavy.
[27:29.540 --> 27:30.840]  That's the concern in my head.
[27:31.280 --> 27:33.480]  What I will say is that I've never in a single day
[27:33.480 --> 27:34.920]  eaten so much off the floor.
[27:35.400 --> 27:36.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[27:36.460 --> 27:39.620]  We made every effort to save
[27:39.620 --> 27:40.820]  as much...
[27:40.820 --> 27:43.320]  We didn't want to spoil food.
[27:43.820 --> 27:44.720]  I didn't have lunch.
[27:45.280 --> 27:46.880]  Nick and I decided we were going to eat all the fruit.
[27:47.140 --> 27:48.360]  We did our damnedest.
[27:48.740 --> 27:51.520]  Some fruit explodes faster than other fruit.
[27:51.520 --> 27:52.260]  I will say that.
[27:53.320 --> 27:54.840]  In the context of eating,
[27:55.440 --> 27:57.440]  there was a discussion about Nick
[27:57.440 --> 27:58.660]  possibly eating
[27:59.180 --> 28:01.600]  some of the fish stuff.
[28:02.400 --> 28:03.160]  The surstromming?
[28:03.440 --> 28:05.280]  The surstromming, yeah. Did that occur?
[28:05.920 --> 28:06.940]  Do you want to know if it occurred?
[28:07.420 --> 28:08.360]  Well, I...
[28:08.920 --> 28:09.660]  I don't...
[28:11.400 --> 28:12.840]  I'd say it's down to Nick.
[28:13.260 --> 28:13.880]  There was an attempt.
[28:14.820 --> 28:16.220]  That's good. That's all I need to know.
[28:16.300 --> 28:17.380]  I just need to know if it's there.
[28:17.380 --> 28:18.400]  I don't need...
[28:18.400 --> 28:20.860]  In my head, he took a bite of it and said,
[28:20.940 --> 28:22.100]  It's better than cucumber.
[28:22.500 --> 28:24.120]  And then just continued to munch away.
[28:24.300 --> 28:25.580]  At least it's not that.
[28:26.780 --> 28:28.320]  So I'm glad. I'm excited to see.
[28:28.400 --> 28:29.420]  This is going to be great video content.
[28:29.920 --> 28:32.300]  I will say, in the moment,
[28:32.440 --> 28:33.460]  I think Nick...
[28:34.040 --> 28:35.400]  In the moment of truth,
[28:35.520 --> 28:37.760]  I think Nick questioned a lot of Nick's life choices
[28:37.760 --> 28:39.600]  leading up to that point.
[28:42.420 --> 28:43.620]  Oh, this is...
[28:43.620 --> 28:44.960]  Without giving any spoilers.
[28:44.960 --> 28:47.820]  I saw a lot flash across his face.
[28:50.680 --> 28:53.120]  I was corrected by someone
[28:53.120 --> 28:54.840]  in the comment leaver who said,
[28:55.940 --> 28:57.740]  Icing on the cake and the cherry on top
[28:57.740 --> 28:58.880]  aren't about cakes.
[28:59.560 --> 29:01.320]  Only icing on the cake is about a cake.
[29:01.460 --> 29:02.760]  Cherry on top is about ice cream.
[29:03.200 --> 29:04.300]  Yeah, like ice cream sundae, probably.
[29:04.680 --> 29:06.620]  Yeah, and I think that makes sense.
[29:06.700 --> 29:09.520]  Because I don't think I've ever seen just a single cherry on the top of a cake.
[29:09.980 --> 29:10.180]  No.
[29:11.060 --> 29:13.140]  So they're like just two separate...
[29:13.140 --> 29:15.460]  There's definitely singular cherry zones
[29:15.460 --> 29:15.900]  though.
[29:16.620 --> 29:19.040]  I'm thinking like a deep forest.
[29:19.320 --> 29:21.040]  Jesus Christ. I'm sorry, I'm still sick.
[29:21.260 --> 29:22.300]  Black forest cake.
[29:23.100 --> 29:24.740]  I feel like you get
[29:24.740 --> 29:26.880]  whipped cream right on top and there's little
[29:26.880 --> 29:29.100]  individual cherries and different clusters of it.
[29:29.220 --> 29:31.020]  So multiple cherries on top, but you got
[29:31.020 --> 29:33.100]  cherry zones. You got singular cherry zones.
[29:33.740 --> 29:34.380]  Are you a cherry guy?
[29:35.160 --> 29:36.100]  I can be.
[29:36.700 --> 29:39.020]  I don't think I'm going for cherries all that often,
[29:39.180 --> 29:40.640]  but if there's a bowl,
[29:40.640 --> 29:41.660]  I'll indulge.
[29:43.100 --> 29:45.000]  Wasn't the cake in Portal a cherry cake?
[29:45.800 --> 29:46.980]  I think it was.
[29:47.820 --> 29:48.540]  I think you're right.
[29:49.060 --> 29:49.200]  Yeah.
[29:49.480 --> 29:52.700]  I guess it depends. Cherry on top could be
[29:52.700 --> 29:53.400]  the last cherry.
[29:54.160 --> 29:56.840]  I think it could be a cake. I think it could be a black forest cake.
[29:57.760 --> 29:58.820]  Are those cherries?
[29:59.420 --> 29:59.900]  Yeah, they are.
[30:00.440 --> 30:01.580]  Yeah, they're cherries.
[30:01.840 --> 30:04.340]  Yeah, I'm looking all over the internet.
[30:05.320 --> 30:05.620]  Okay.
[30:07.460 --> 30:07.740]  Well, yeah.
[30:07.740 --> 30:10.560]  Clear cherry zones on top of the Portal cake.
[30:11.120 --> 30:11.960]  Singular cherry zones.
[30:12.600 --> 30:13.920]  As we know in my blankets,
[30:14.060 --> 30:16.920]  I'm a big zone guy. I've gone into zone coverage.
[30:17.140 --> 30:17.920]  Are you still doing zones?
[30:19.000 --> 30:20.140]  I'm still doing zones.
[30:20.480 --> 30:22.400]  Yeah, I had a moment the other day where I
[30:23.620 --> 30:24.420]  did laundry
[30:24.420 --> 30:26.820]  and I forgot to put one of the towels away
[30:26.820 --> 30:28.840]  and I stretched my foot out and I felt a little towel
[30:28.840 --> 30:30.560]  and I was like, ooh, that was unexpected.
[30:30.740 --> 30:31.260]  That was nice.
[30:33.120 --> 30:34.360]  Wait, so there's just
[30:34.360 --> 30:36.440]  a towel hidden in the bed?
[30:36.440 --> 30:38.200]  It was at the foot of the bed.
[30:38.300 --> 30:40.720]  Yeah, it was like laid out on the bottom of the bed
[30:41.120 --> 30:42.200]  and I didn't know it was there.
[30:42.480 --> 30:44.480]  I stretched out and I felt that my toe hit it.
[30:44.540 --> 30:45.680]  I was like, what's that? Oh, okay.
[30:46.060 --> 30:47.380]  Do you put towels on the bed?
[30:48.120 --> 30:49.780]  Well, I brought in all of
[30:51.040 --> 30:52.220]  the stuff that I cleaned.
[30:52.320 --> 30:54.280]  It was like clothes and towels and all that stuff
[30:54.280 --> 30:56.660]  and I put it on the bed and I folded it all on the bed
[30:56.660 --> 30:58.080]  and then I moved them to different areas
[30:58.080 --> 30:59.400]  and I just missed one of the towels.
[31:00.040 --> 31:02.220]  You do a lot in the bedroom. You get a lot done.
[31:02.560 --> 31:04.740]  Well, I was transferring stuff. I don't know what that means.
[31:05.420 --> 31:06.080]  What do you mean?
[31:06.920 --> 31:08.880]  When you're in the lab, is that in the bedroom
[31:08.880 --> 31:09.380]  or the kitchen?
[31:10.320 --> 31:11.840]  Oh, it depends on what the project is.
[31:12.300 --> 31:14.200]  So you have multiple labs.
[31:14.560 --> 31:16.580]  Yeah, the lab is wherever you're putting the work in.
[31:17.360 --> 31:17.800]  Interesting.
[31:18.640 --> 31:20.380]  Where would you say you put the most work in?
[31:21.740 --> 31:22.760]  Uh, where do I
[31:22.760 --> 31:25.300]  put the most work in? Probably...
[31:25.300 --> 31:26.520]  Well, my office is also
[31:26.520 --> 31:28.360]  in my bedroom, so probably my bedroom.
[31:29.000 --> 31:30.880]  I'd say the lab is the bedroom.
[31:31.160 --> 31:32.860]  When you go to your office,
[31:32.860 --> 31:34.240]  even though it's in your bedroom,
[31:34.400 --> 31:36.520]  are you mentally leaving your bedroom
[31:36.520 --> 31:38.180]  and clocking in
[31:38.180 --> 31:40.400]  in a different space?
[31:40.840 --> 31:42.760]  Even though it's physically situated in the room.
[31:42.880 --> 31:44.960]  You're like, don't talk to me, I'm in my office now.
[31:45.200 --> 31:46.140]  This is office time.
[31:46.600 --> 31:48.800]  Oh, for sure. Yeah, I can't
[31:48.800 --> 31:50.600]  sleep. You know, sometimes
[31:50.600 --> 31:52.780]  I might want to relax and sit at my
[31:52.780 --> 31:55.060]  desk chair and my feet can reach the bed.
[31:55.460 --> 31:56.560]  I can't sleep like that, though.
[31:56.960 --> 31:58.880]  I get comfortable like that, but it just feels weird
[31:58.880 --> 32:00.600]  having my feet in my comfort zone,
[32:00.600 --> 32:01.780]  my upper half,
[32:02.280 --> 32:03.920]  in my work zone.
[32:04.400 --> 32:05.940]  Yeah, in the business zone. Exactly.
[32:06.120 --> 32:08.220]  Yeah, and you gotta be respectful to your business space, too.
[32:08.300 --> 32:10.060]  You don't want to be napping and lounging around there.
[32:10.720 --> 32:12.640]  And we're talking, we're doing blindside
[32:12.640 --> 32:14.540]  aides over here, okay? This is serious business.
[32:15.040 --> 32:16.680]  We're not joking around
[32:16.680 --> 32:17.820]  in this business zone.
[32:18.320 --> 32:20.500]  Have you ever been absolutely bollocked by
[32:20.500 --> 32:22.560]  someone, but you didn't
[32:22.560 --> 32:24.060]  really know why they were angry?
[32:24.800 --> 32:26.520]  I don't know. First of all, you need to
[32:26.520 --> 32:27.520]  explain the first part.
[32:27.520 --> 32:29.420]  Oh, like, told off.
[32:29.580 --> 32:31.800]  Giving a real bloody shout-out.
[32:32.640 --> 32:33.280]  Oh, yeah.
[32:33.460 --> 32:34.560]  Every day in the army.
[32:35.580 --> 32:37.520]  I would just get yelled at by
[32:37.520 --> 32:39.340]  strangers that were a higher rank than me
[32:39.340 --> 32:40.760]  for, like, no reason.
[32:41.300 --> 32:43.460]  Just like, if somebody saw... like, the way the army
[32:43.460 --> 32:45.320]  works, if somebody is having a bad day
[32:45.320 --> 32:47.420]  and they see you and you're a lesser rank than
[32:47.420 --> 32:49.220]  them, then they have every right
[32:49.220 --> 32:51.320]  and inclination to just destroy you
[32:51.320 --> 32:53.620]  to make themselves feel better. For no reason.
[32:54.040 --> 32:55.280]  Did pretty much everyone do that?
[32:55.280 --> 32:57.060]  Yeah. Well, there's some people who are nice.
[32:57.400 --> 32:59.240]  No, I mean, there's exceptions to every rule. There are
[32:59.240 --> 33:01.160]  nice people, for sure, but there were way more
[33:01.160 --> 33:02.120]  dickheads than nice people.
[33:07.790 --> 33:09.150]  Today's episode is sponsored by
[33:09.150 --> 33:11.010]  PayPal Honey, the easy way to save when
[33:11.010 --> 33:12.330]  shopping on your iPhone or computer.
[33:12.890 --> 33:15.150]  Man, with inflation, everything is so expensive
[33:15.150 --> 33:17.110]  now. Like, chips are five to
[33:17.110 --> 33:18.910]  six dollars a peg. It's ridiculous.
[33:19.490 --> 33:20.350]  Eggs are insane.
[33:20.870 --> 33:23.250]  And with all these high prices, it makes finding a deal
[33:23.250 --> 33:25.190]  even more important. Or at least that's the case
[33:25.190 --> 33:26.910]  for me. And thanks to Honey,
[33:26.910 --> 33:28.830]  manually searching for coupon codes
[33:28.830 --> 33:30.810]  is a thing of the past. Honey is the
[33:30.810 --> 33:32.830]  free shopping tool that scours the internet for
[33:32.830 --> 33:34.890]  promo codes and applies the best one it finds to
[33:34.890 --> 33:36.730]  your cart. How it works is
[33:36.730 --> 33:38.710]  imagine you're shopping on one of your favorite sites.
[33:39.110 --> 33:40.770]  When you check out, the Honey button appears
[33:40.770 --> 33:42.670]  and all you have to do is click Apply Coupons.
[33:43.110 --> 33:45.010]  Wait a few seconds as Honey searches for coupons
[33:45.010 --> 33:45.990]  it can find for that site.
[33:46.570 --> 33:49.010]  If Honey finds a working coupon, you'll watch
[33:49.010 --> 33:50.030]  the prices drop.
[33:50.610 --> 33:52.910]  I use Honey and it is so easy
[33:52.910 --> 33:54.810]  to set up. It's convenient. I've saved
[33:54.810 --> 33:56.770]  money on technology, clothing,
[33:56.950 --> 33:58.470]  food, all sorts of stuff.
[33:58.650 --> 34:00.910]  And it's just good to know that if I'm shopping somewhere, I know
[34:00.910 --> 34:02.890]  I'm going to get a coupon if there's one available.
[34:03.430 --> 34:04.850]  But did you know that Honey doesn't just
[34:04.850 --> 34:06.870]  work on desktop? It works on your iPhone
[34:06.870 --> 34:08.630]  too. Just activate Safari
[34:08.630 --> 34:10.270]  on your phone and save on the go.
[34:10.810 --> 34:12.830]  If you don't already have Honey, you could be straight
[34:12.830 --> 34:15.070]  up missing out. And by getting it, you'll be doing yourself
[34:15.070 --> 34:16.630]  a solid and supporting this show.

[34:24.430 --> 34:26.450]  The best way to learn a language is through
[34:26.450 --> 34:28.290]  immersion. Living where the language is spoken
[34:28.290 --> 34:29.910]  natively and using it every day.
[34:30.230 --> 34:31.690]  But that's not possible for everyone.
[34:32.090 --> 34:33.970]  So what's the second best way to learn a language?
[34:34.430 --> 34:35.970]  Babble. Because with Babble,
[34:36.250 --> 34:38.330]  you can start speaking a new language in just
[34:38.330 --> 34:40.290]  three weeks. This summer,
[34:40.650 --> 34:42.290]  you can start speaking a new language
[34:42.290 --> 34:44.030]  with Babble. Why Babble?
[34:44.210 --> 34:46.090]  Because it works. Instead of paying
[34:46.090 --> 34:47.810]  hundreds of dollars for a private tutor,
[34:48.150 --> 34:50.230]  or fooling yourself with language apps that are a little more
[34:50.230 --> 34:52.190]  than games, Babble's quick 10-minute
[34:52.190 --> 34:54.070]  lessons are designed by over 150
[34:54.070 --> 34:56.290]  language experts to help you start speaking
[34:56.290 --> 34:58.110]  a new language in as little as
[34:58.110 --> 35:00.090]  three weeks. Babble is designed by
[35:00.090 --> 35:01.750]  real people for real conversations.
[35:02.270 --> 35:04.170]  All of Babble's tips and tools for learning a new
[35:04.170 --> 35:05.830]  language are approachable, accessible,
[35:06.370 --> 35:07.690]  rooted in real-life situations,
[35:08.190 --> 35:10.190]  and delivered with conversation-based teaching.
[35:10.650 --> 35:12.070]  And with Babble's convenient courses,
[35:12.270 --> 35:14.090]  they help you learn real-life conversation
[35:14.090 --> 35:16.230]  skills. It's so easy to pick up on how
[35:16.230 --> 35:18.110]  to order food, ask for directions,
[35:18.110 --> 35:20.190]  speak to merchants, without having
[35:20.190 --> 35:22.130]  to consult language apps while on vacation.
[35:22.650 --> 35:24.270]  Plus, Babble's speech
[35:24.270 --> 35:26.330]  recognition technology helps you to improve
[35:26.330 --> 35:27.770]  your pronunciation and accent.
[35:28.430 --> 35:30.270]  Studies from Yale, Michigan State
[35:30.270 --> 35:32.330]  University, and others continue to prove
[35:32.330 --> 35:34.550]  Babble is better. For instance,
[35:34.970 --> 35:36.290]  one study found that using
[35:36.290 --> 35:38.350]  Babble for 15 hours is the equivalent
[35:38.350 --> 35:39.990]  to a full semester at college.
[35:40.490 --> 35:42.230]  With over 10 million subscriptions sold,
[35:42.630 --> 35:44.090]  Babble is real language learning
[35:44.090 --> 35:45.250]  for real conversations.

[37:32.630 --> 37:34.850]  I remember being in a shop
[37:34.850 --> 37:36.510]  this is where... I was probably
[37:37.430 --> 37:38.650]  maybe 5 or
[37:38.650 --> 37:40.530]  6 and I was shopping
[37:40.530 --> 37:42.730]  with my mum in Tame
[37:42.730 --> 37:44.210]  where I grew up and there was this little
[37:44.830 --> 37:46.390]  home furniture shop called
[37:46.390 --> 37:48.630]  Cargo and a very
[37:48.630 --> 37:50.390]  boring shop for a 6 year old
[37:50.390 --> 37:52.610]  and I was in there and I realized that there
[37:52.610 --> 37:53.950]  was this thing by the door
[37:54.510 --> 37:56.490]  and every time someone walked in there was
[37:56.490 --> 37:58.750]  a tiny little like 7 segment
[37:58.750 --> 38:00.570]  display number written
[38:00.570 --> 38:02.570]  on it or display so it was like every time
[38:02.570 --> 38:04.630]  someone crossed the beam the number
[38:04.630 --> 38:09.810]  I assume they were just like counting people coming in and out every day. But I just noticed
[38:09.810 --> 38:13.930]  it because I was just staring at the wall and like just waiting to leave. And I noticed
[38:13.930 --> 38:17.510]  that the little tiny little number on the, by the ground was just going up every time
[38:17.510 --> 38:21.490]  someone walked in. So I was like, Oh, how does that work? And I just put my hand over
[38:21.490 --> 38:26.750]  it and it went up and I just kept waving my hand in front of it to the point where I probably
[38:26.750 --> 38:35.130]  made the number go up by like a hundred times. And then the guy who owned or like worked
[38:35.130 --> 38:45.130]  in there walked up to me and he just goes, Oh, you little shit. And I think I, I think
[38:45.130 --> 38:51.910]  I cried. Cause I didn't, I didn't know what I was doing was wrong, but I was messing up
[38:51.910 --> 38:52.430]  his numbers.
[38:52.790 --> 38:53.550]  How old were you?
[38:53.830 --> 38:55.010]  Oh, I'm probably six.
[38:55.410 --> 38:56.730]  And you cried in front of him?
[38:57.190 --> 38:58.590]  Yeah, he just made me cry.
[38:58.710 --> 39:00.990]  Did he apologize or what did he do?
[39:01.730 --> 39:07.610]  He yelled in my face. Uh, no, he didn't. Uh, I think I, I ran off. I went and found my
[39:07.610 --> 39:15.550]  mum and just sort of stood by her quietly until we left, but I think that was like the
[39:15.550 --> 39:20.990]  first time I remember being like really like upset by someone, but, but having absolutely
[39:20.990 --> 39:24.730]  no idea that what I was doing was wrong. Cause you know, you know, as a kid, like when you're
[39:24.730 --> 39:29.050]  dicking around, you know, you sometimes deserve a good, a good bollocking, but that was the
[39:29.050 --> 39:30.570]  first one I was like, Oh, what do I do?
[39:30.970 --> 39:35.810]  Wasn't there, wasn't, wasn't that, that was such a great age to be like when your mom
[39:35.810 --> 39:38.810]  would take you to a, I think we talked about, we touched on this a little bit, maybe in
[39:38.810 --> 39:43.150]  the mall draft or talking about malls in general, but like your mom would take you to a department
[39:43.150 --> 39:49.230]  store like Sears or JC Penney's and you, she did, she wanted you out of her face because
[39:49.230 --> 39:52.950]  you were annoying and you didn't want to be there. And so it was, you knew you had like,
[39:52.950 --> 39:57.830]  I have 20 minutes where I can entertain myself and my mom doesn't want me anywhere near her.
[39:58.230 --> 40:04.130]  And so this place just became a magical playground for me to explore. And you're like crawling
[40:04.130 --> 40:08.970]  under the dresses and trying to hide and like trying to hide in between the clothes to scare
[40:08.970 --> 40:11.930]  people when they come by. And just like, I always remember there was like, it was fun
[40:11.930 --> 40:14.830]  for about 15 or 20 minutes and then you go through all the fun and then you're bored
[40:14.830 --> 40:18.390]  to tears again and you, you go like beg your mom to leave. But there's this like a little
[40:18.390 --> 40:23.670]  window where a department store to a six-year-old is like Shangri-La. Yeah. I remember there
[40:23.670 --> 40:28.250]  was one store that I actually got excited about going to and it was just a normal clothes
[40:28.250 --> 40:33.010]  shop, but it had just such great hiding spots like under all the, under all the trousers
[40:33.010 --> 40:39.290]  and coats and stuff. I loved any store that had beds. And you can see how long you get
[40:39.290 --> 40:43.830]  away with jumping on beds before somebody would yell at you. Like if you were lucky,
[40:43.830 --> 40:49.650]  you could try to jump from bed to bed and you know, like three beds jumped before somebody
[40:49.650 --> 40:53.510]  comes and screams at you. How many, how many beds do you think you could jump now before
[40:53.510 --> 40:57.710]  somebody would come and scream at you? Do you think you can break the record to three?
[40:58.870 --> 41:03.690]  I think if we, I think that would be a great challenge for us in that mall show. Andrew's
[41:03.690 --> 41:10.690]  like angels or whatever. It becomes funnier, the older you get the whole jumping on bed
[41:10.690 --> 41:18.690]  gag in a store. I mean, there's problems at the moment in some places where just like
[41:18.690 --> 41:23.210]  20 youths will just come in and pillage a place. I just like the idea of just the three
[41:23.210 --> 41:27.250]  of us running in. We don't want to break anything, we just want to jump on their beds and hide
[41:27.250 --> 41:32.530]  behind the clothes. I just want to see. I don't, what age does that become a problem? You can't,
[41:32.530 --> 41:38.490]  like you now cannot hide in the clothes section and pop out at people. That's a real problem.
[41:38.670 --> 41:43.530]  It's like at one point you're just a kid and then there's a threshold where you become
[41:43.530 --> 41:49.570]  a pervert. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. The child at heart defense is really difficult
[41:49.570 --> 41:55.670]  to sell. It's a tough one. Yeah. The way a police officer talks to you changes like almost
[41:55.670 --> 42:02.430]  overnight. I think you need to get caught bed hopping first and that establishes your
[42:02.430 --> 42:07.490]  defensive child at heart. And then when they're like, oh, it's the bed guy. No, yeah, it's
[42:07.490 --> 42:13.030]  fine. Like, sir, what are you doing? Sir, I'm clearly going through something here.
[42:17.790 --> 42:25.770]  I love the idea of getting trespassed from undecimated dresses. Nicks said, let me have
[42:25.770 --> 42:33.610]  this moment. Kick me out in 30 seconds. Go for the record. You don't understand. You
[42:33.610 --> 42:39.670]  don't understand. My friend on the Internet said I have to jump four beds. And why is
[42:39.670 --> 42:43.870]  it that that is unacceptable? Is it that you're damaging the bed? Like if your shoes are off,
[42:44.050 --> 42:48.930]  you're not like messing it up. You're damaging the bed. When does the threshold from testing
[42:48.930 --> 42:55.010]  to damaging flip? Yeah, because you're allowed to flump onto a bed, just like flop back onto
[42:55.010 --> 43:02.430]  it. Yeah. What test? That's not what they're used for. Like buying a mattress. Yeah. You
[43:02.430 --> 43:07.190]  go test the mattress out. Yeah, but you don't. I don't like jump. There's an extreme and jumping
[43:07.190 --> 43:11.970]  on a bed to like any other use for that bed. I want to test two things when I'm buying a
[43:11.970 --> 43:17.730]  mattress. I want to test its its liability and its flump ability. Like I want to flop down onto it.
[43:18.430 --> 43:23.390]  If I let's say I buy like a controller, I'm not going to drop it to the floor to test it like
[43:23.390 --> 43:27.330]  I don't need to. I'm not throwing the bed out a window. I'm just. No, but you're jumping on it.
[43:27.330 --> 43:30.910]  You're putting a lot of force into that bed. That's the kind of force I'm going to be using
[43:30.910 --> 43:36.030]  it with. You use that type of force in the bed. First of all, you're a dive onto your.
[43:36.470 --> 43:39.950]  You're a tuck. You're a tuck in guy. You're telling me you use a lot of force. There's
[43:39.950 --> 43:46.590]  something delicate about it. I don't tuck myself in. Whoa. What? How do you tuck you in? How do
[43:46.590 --> 43:50.770]  you tuck yourself in? That's difficult. That's a tall task. No, I think I think you have to have
[43:50.770 --> 43:54.130]  ritual, though, if you're going around tucking people in, you better be tucking at home.
[43:54.690 --> 43:58.410]  I probably dive onto the bed to get into bed maybe one in three times.
[43:59.630 --> 44:03.290]  Oh, that used to be the only way to go into bed. You know, a monster is to grab your feet when
[44:03.290 --> 44:07.930]  you're trying to get to the bed. You got to do the run and start. Excellent point. That's what
[44:07.930 --> 44:13.830]  and that's what we would tell the security guard. In my current step, I can actually jump from the
[44:13.830 --> 44:18.350]  bathroom into the bed without touching the bedroom floor. That's probably smart because
[44:18.350 --> 44:32.290]  there's glass from that apple control. Imagine if that's how it works. You're like, oh, I dropped
[44:32.290 --> 44:36.330]  a glass in my bedroom and there's glass all over the floor. Now I just have to avoid that part.
[44:36.790 --> 44:39.910]  Like if there was no cleanup, you're just like, I just have to walk differently now.
[44:41.390 --> 44:44.110]  Yeah, I could also dive from like the threshold of the door,
[44:44.550 --> 44:47.410]  like outside the bedroom into the bed as well. I have a very small bedroom.
[44:48.730 --> 44:52.790]  Yeah, I couldn't tell if you're telling us that you had a small bedroom or you're flexing about
[44:52.790 --> 44:56.890]  how far you could jump. It was one of the two. No, it's just a practically small bedroom.
[44:57.110 --> 45:02.710]  Do you think you're jumping onto a bed ability is declining? I was watching you yesterday when
[45:02.710 --> 45:06.630]  we were running around and doing stuff. I think I think I think I think I'm starting to see the
[45:06.630 --> 45:13.070]  first signs of age in you. Really? Yeah, for sure. He's lost a step. Do you? But can you tell like
[45:13.070 --> 45:16.890]  when you jump on the bed and stuff? Do you feel it? No. What do you mean? Like I was moving old?
[45:16.890 --> 45:21.230]  Yeah, you're looking at you're looking a little old. You're not. Yeah, you're you're you're you're
[45:21.230 --> 45:25.610]  a little shuffler than you were. You're a little shuffler shuffler. You're not. I'll be honest.
[45:25.670 --> 45:29.610]  You're not throwing shit as far as you used to. You just I can tell you're hitting that point.
[45:29.970 --> 45:32.930]  I had the second day. Yeah, you fucking you're not supposed to talk about anything.
[45:33.250 --> 45:36.930]  First off, you've clearly lost a step mentally. You can't keep your shit straight.
[45:38.110 --> 45:39.970]  I was getting insulted. I had to be defensive.
[45:40.870 --> 45:44.070]  It's not an insult at all. I just wanted if you can tell because others can.
[45:44.410 --> 45:45.790]  Let me be honest with you. I've been doing
[45:48.510 --> 45:54.610]  I've been doing some exercise and I had an incredibly sore lap yesterday.
[45:56.090 --> 46:02.910]  Oh, you had a sore lap? Yeah, my whatever that is. The quads. My lap was used.
[46:03.690 --> 46:08.650]  This is where he tells us that he's been bed hopping for years, Geoff. This is like his form of
[46:08.650 --> 46:17.730]  fitness. This is how he stays so bouncy. Did you hop a little too hard the day before or
[46:17.730 --> 46:22.650]  something? Yeah, yeah. Very sore lap to the point where like climbing stairs is miserable and
[46:23.390 --> 46:28.190]  chasing after fruit was also a little bit painful. So I was shuffling around.
[46:28.850 --> 46:33.590]  I'm right there with you, man. I've been, you know, just trying to get a little trim and in
[46:33.590 --> 46:38.210]  shape for the wedding, you know, and so I've been riding my bike every day because, as Eric pointed
[46:38.210 --> 46:42.770]  out, I'm not capable of any other kind of exercise. He's right. So I've been riding my bike every
[46:42.770 --> 46:47.090]  morning at like six or seven a.m. at 30, 20, somewhere between 22 and 30 miles, depending on
[46:47.090 --> 46:53.790]  the day, without taking breaks. And I am exhausted and sore 24 hours a day right now. It's like a
[46:53.790 --> 46:59.070]  good sore, but God damn, we were walking to H-E-B yesterday. I had already had a 30 mile bike ride
[46:59.070 --> 47:03.750]  and we got to the bridge and I was feeling it and I was like, we're not even halfway to H-E-B yet.
[47:05.390 --> 47:09.810]  I'm gonna tap out before we get to the fruit. You're just gonna hold the bridge down.
[47:09.930 --> 47:15.030]  You guys keep going. I'm gonna keep this safe. Make sure no trolls show up.
[47:17.430 --> 47:21.790]  All right, well, next time I'll see if I look as old because maybe I wouldn't have just
[47:21.790 --> 47:28.910]  done a bunch of activity. Now I'm self-conscious. Yeah. Maybe you'll stretch next time.
[47:28.990 --> 47:32.450]  Maybe you'll really get into the zone. You didn't realize you were being evaluated last time.
[47:32.450 --> 47:37.430]  Yeah, I think that's my problem. I don't, I don't do like enough stretching afterwards. You gotta
[47:37.430 --> 47:42.550]  stretch. You have to stretch. Gotta stretch. You seem very rubbery. You seem like you'd be good
[47:42.550 --> 47:47.690]  at stretching. I feel like you're a very rubbery guy. Yeah, there's some flexibility there. Yeah,
[47:47.770 --> 47:52.850]  for sure. That's a good point. You are, you're, you're rubbery in like a Jim Carrey way a little
[47:52.850 --> 47:59.910]  bit. Not like the faces and stuff, but just like body in general. Yeah. I'll take that. That's a
[47:59.910 --> 48:04.290]  compliment. It's meant as a compliment. And I guess that's why I noticed you losing a step
[48:04.290 --> 48:08.370]  because, you know, I paid so much attention to you and your Jim Carrey-ness over the years.
[48:10.350 --> 48:15.490]  There's a whippiness in his limbs, I'd say, when doing a physical act. Have you been analyzing
[48:15.490 --> 48:20.070]  my limbs, Andrew? No, it's just, I've seen you throw something and it was something I remembered.
[48:20.590 --> 48:25.690]  What'd I throw? Uh, you were throwing balls at the arcade that time we went to the arcade. That
[48:25.690 --> 48:31.810]  didn't happen. My favorite Gavin is, you can tell when he's, uh, my favorite physical Gavin
[48:31.810 --> 48:36.590]  is you can tell when he's about to try to tackle you. He gets this little like grin on his face
[48:36.590 --> 48:41.070]  and then he stoops over a bit and gets a little hunchy and he starts to lean into you a little
[48:41.070 --> 48:46.950]  bit to like push on you. I start using like the top, the top of my eye sockets. Yeah. That's
[48:46.950 --> 48:55.670]  what I know. He's, he's about to bounce off of me, uh, and then roll around on the ground for a
[48:55.670 --> 49:02.470]  completely hit you in the back. You don't go down and I bounce off. Yeah. I'm Gavin proof.
[49:03.790 --> 49:07.950]  Do we put out all the videos where I would just mess with you while we were at work in the
[49:07.950 --> 49:12.030]  Congress office? I don't know. I don't know. I guess one where I tried to like
[49:12.030 --> 49:18.110]  jizz on you with a hand sanitizer every day. There was one where I just spent all day trying
[49:18.110 --> 49:22.710]  to smash a cupcake into your mouth. And you used to just run and try to tackle me in the chair.
[49:23.550 --> 49:26.810]  Yeah. Should I make a little compilation of all those? Yeah. Why not?
[49:28.590 --> 49:31.990]  Yeah. This is all a game where it was like we, we, we had that game where we,
[49:32.210 --> 49:36.250]  whoever was falling asleep first got, got slapped. Yeah. And then, uh, I feel like all
[49:36.250 --> 49:40.490]  of our messing with each other, it was like pre-stated that it was okay. Yeah. No, we,
[49:40.610 --> 49:44.890]  it was like agreed upon ahead of time. Yeah. Which is why a lot of the time when I'm diving
[49:44.890 --> 49:47.810]  onto the top of your head while you're trying to do work in your chair,
[49:48.370 --> 49:49.790]  I don't know why you look so annoyed.
[49:53.650 --> 49:56.510]  Because you're trying to compress my spine while I'm working.
[49:58.010 --> 50:02.610]  I always, I handle it though. There was one where I jumped on like over your
[50:02.610 --> 50:07.570]  shoulder while you're at your desk. And I sort of slipped over into your lap and you just
[50:08.630 --> 50:12.130]  used your knee to kick my head into the underneath of your desk.
[50:14.930 --> 50:19.850]  But that's how it always went for me. I always started it and I always hit my head nine times
[50:19.850 --> 50:26.590]  on the underneath of a desk. Oh, that's when we were young, but that was before we lost a step.
[50:27.230 --> 50:35.270]  Yeah. Yeah. I was probably a 21. I was probably some 22, 23. What was the last time you'd say
[50:35.270 --> 50:41.310]  you tried to jizz on Geoff Gavin using your, your vernacular? Uh, yeah, but maybe a decade and a
[50:41.310 --> 50:46.090]  half. It's been a while. It's been a while. Wow. Sounds like you're due for a jizzing.
[50:46.150 --> 50:54.710]  That's what I'm hearing. He's all backed up. Oh man. Can I do it to you as well? Andrew,
[50:54.830 --> 51:01.530]  can I attack you? Of course. Of course. I'd love it. How do you think that would go for me? Um,
[51:01.990 --> 51:08.390]  I, I, I don't think well for either of us. I envision you just catching me with one hand
[51:08.390 --> 51:13.630]  somehow by the neck. Oh, that's aggressive. I don't think it would. I don't think that would.
[51:14.210 --> 51:18.250]  Maybe I'd, I'd grab you and then we'd both go down together. The, the ankle would fall.
[51:19.010 --> 51:24.070]  I was about to say, I think no matter what happens, if Gavin tackles Andrew,
[51:24.230 --> 51:31.190]  only three ankles are getting up. Oh yeah, for sure. It would be, we would look like,
[51:31.250 --> 51:35.950]  I don't know my head, you tackling me. It results in like the cheese lady falling down the hill
[51:35.950 --> 51:41.850]  is the type of impact that we're looking at. I'm just imagining me tackling you and then it's
[51:41.850 --> 51:48.690]  just your feet and shoes remain and just like somehow it snaps off. Like a poof of air. It's
[51:48.690 --> 51:53.750]  just two shoes rocking. It's like the license plate in Back to the Future.
[51:58.170 --> 52:04.650]  Oh, did you see, um, did you see Fast X Gavin with 40X? I haven't yet. I tried to arrange a
[52:04.650 --> 52:09.870]  face, uh, screening, but everyone was busy. Yeah. One day. And then you never tried again.
[52:10.770 --> 52:15.190]  I mean, trying once that's a lot for me. And it wasn't even that no one was available is that
[52:15.190 --> 52:20.490]  there weren't tickets available on that day. I haven't heard anything else since that moment.
[52:21.130 --> 52:27.370]  Well, I was trying to make Eric do it, uh, firstly. And also I think Nick couldn't
[52:28.030 --> 52:33.610]  because of something. I blame Nick. Oh, okay. Let's probably. Oh yeah. Potty training.
[52:34.850 --> 52:38.950]  Oh, that's right. You are potty training. Is that an all day thing?
[52:39.490 --> 52:43.130]  It's an all weekend thing and it didn't go very well at all. He, uh, he decided,
[52:43.290 --> 52:47.630]  uh, once the diaper was off, he'd rather just hold it until it hurt than to go. So we're back
[52:47.630 --> 52:52.230]  to diapers. We're having fun. So, so what you're saying is if you had gone, nothing would have
[52:52.990 --> 53:01.970]  changed. Ah, shit. Uh, if I could, it's probably way too late in the game to attempt something
[53:01.970 --> 53:08.310]  like this, Nick. But when I was going through potty training, uh, I did do this. Um, apparently
[53:08.310 --> 53:12.410]  if you potty train in cloth diapers, which is annoying cause you got to deal with cloth diapers,
[53:12.950 --> 53:17.190]  uh, but they will, uh, they will potty train a lot faster because it's a little less comfortable
[53:17.190 --> 53:23.090]  and it encourages them to, to, to learn faster. I used to have a service, like a diaper service
[53:23.090 --> 53:27.570]  where I would like, he had like a little trash can that was sealed and you would drop the dirty
[53:27.570 --> 53:31.330]  diapers in the cloth ones and then put it on the front porch and then they would pick it up and drop
[53:31.330 --> 53:36.030]  off new diapers. And yeah, it was like, God, that's amazing. Fancy. I didn't know that existed.
[53:36.450 --> 53:40.410]  Yeah. That's how Millie, that's how Millie was potty trained. Is it expensive? Like per
[53:40.410 --> 53:46.610]  shit pickup? Uh, yeah, it's about the same as buying diapers, which are crazy expensive,
[53:47.790 --> 53:52.810]  but you don't fill a landfill with your kid's piss and shit, which is.
[53:54.450 --> 53:58.230]  If that doesn't work, another tip you could try. I've heard, I don't know if this works for everyone,
[53:58.230 --> 54:03.770]  but just maybe like book a flight with a potty and make sure there's a famous film director on
[54:03.770 --> 54:11.730]  the flight. They will use that potty. No problem. They'll fill it up. What I hear. So you had a few
[54:11.730 --> 54:16.130]  things you could do. You had a few approaches. Hopefully at least one of them. Something helps
[54:16.130 --> 54:20.270]  Nick. And you might, if you show up early, you can defer your flight. You could actually make
[54:20.270 --> 54:26.050]  money doing this. This could be a business venture. Yeah. You could piss on a different director.
[54:26.050 --> 54:33.370]  Oh, you can try to see how many directors your kid could piss on off the cost of one ticket.
[54:37.830 --> 54:40.490]  Like to point out, there's still absolutely no evidence that, uh,
[54:40.570 --> 54:45.350]  Edgar Wright had any urine on his head. So we might be, there's, there's no evidence
[54:45.350 --> 54:51.410]  that he didn't either. Is there? Well, that's true. Yeah. Schrodinger's piss or whatever.
[54:52.850 --> 55:00.130]  Schrodinger's piss. Um, I, oh, I'd be so happy. I'm waiting for him to promote like a movie or
[55:00.130 --> 55:04.270]  something and up on a late night show and tell the story. Cause it feels like a late night story.
[55:04.570 --> 55:09.430]  It does. Why do you want that to have happened to him? Cause it, well, I, it, it had happened
[55:09.430 --> 55:14.350]  to him. It's not what I want or didn't want to happen. This is an act that happened to him. So
[55:14.350 --> 55:18.150]  I'm just hoping to hear it in a different form. Yeah, but I'm sat here hoping to God that it
[55:18.150 --> 55:22.430]  didn't happen. Well, it definitely did. You're just in denial. That's the difference.
[55:23.870 --> 55:27.710]  The best thing you can hope for Gavin is that he has a sense of humor about it.
[55:27.970 --> 55:31.450]  And he turns it into a humorous anecdote to James Corden or somebody.
[55:32.030 --> 55:38.830]  Yeah. Gavin, that whole flight was in the splash zone. You can deny it, but it's true.
[55:39.490 --> 55:45.310]  Piss splash. Edgar Wright's taking a bath in Gavin's nephew's piss.
[55:48.410 --> 55:54.190]  Jesus. Let me ask you guys a question. I just looked at the, I just looked at the time and
[55:54.190 --> 55:59.630]  how long we've been going for. Uh, what did we talk about for the last hour? I couldn't tell you.
[56:00.610 --> 56:06.190]  I'm still waiting for the podcast to start. This one was just a nice chat. Yeah. I didn't
[56:06.190 --> 56:11.090]  even look at my notes. Uh, I, well, I brought my clip. That was the only note I used. I think
[56:11.090 --> 56:15.670]  I had my life hack. Oh, do you want to talk about Jeeps, Geoff? You're going to talk about
[56:15.670 --> 56:19.950]  Jeeps last episode. Oh, you know, that's interesting. I have a life hack. Uh, now that
[56:19.950 --> 56:24.650]  you mentioned it and I have that Jeep thing, uh, neither as much, let me start with my life hack.
[56:24.850 --> 56:31.230]  So if you, uh, if you have a, here's a life hack for you. If you have a toilet roll holder, that's,
[56:31.350 --> 56:38.670]  uh, screwed into your wall, right? Uh, anchored into your wall. And over time it starts to loosen
[56:38.670 --> 56:42.910]  up a little bit and no amount of tightening, it tightens it. And then you realize at some point,
[56:42.910 --> 56:46.950]  the anchors are going to give, and it's going to come out of the wall. Uh, the best thing you can
[56:46.950 --> 56:52.150]  do is just to leave it for three or four months because it will frustrate your fiance and make
[56:52.150 --> 56:57.390]  her annoyed that anytime she touches the toilet roll holder, it falls further out of the wall.
[56:57.610 --> 57:01.310]  Then the toilet roll will fall on the ground and then roll away from you. And then you have to
[57:01.870 --> 57:04.990]  comedically try to, you're sitting on a toilet dump and you got to comedically try to like
[57:05.610 --> 57:12.750]  recover all the toilet paper. Happens a lot. Uh, if eventually, if eventually you are faced
[57:12.750 --> 57:17.390]  with the reality of having to fix that problem, you might be tempted to take it out of the wall
[57:17.390 --> 57:23.030]  and then spackle the holes and then sand and then maybe spackle a little bit more than sand and
[57:23.030 --> 57:27.650]  then paint and then find a different spot with a little more integrity to stick, to stick the,
[57:27.650 --> 57:33.030]  uh, the toilet roll holder back on the wall. What I would recommend you do, uh, is just look at the
[57:33.030 --> 57:37.770]  size of those holes that you just made when you pulled it out of the wall and go, let me just
[57:37.770 --> 57:43.730]  find an anchor that fits those holes and do that. And it takes two seconds and you save yourself
[57:43.730 --> 57:49.070]  all kinds of work because that's what I just did. I just secured the toilet roll holder to my wall
[57:49.070 --> 57:56.070]  with the biggest anchors you've ever seen. You couldn't pull, you couldn't, you could pull a
[57:56.070 --> 58:00.890]  safe out of a bank easier than you could pull this toilet roll off of this wall now. And it
[58:00.890 --> 58:05.750]  was so much easier than going through all those other steps. So that's my life. I never thought to
[58:05.750 --> 58:11.970]  do that. That's great. I was, I was just looking at them and I was like making the list to go to
[58:11.970 --> 58:15.130]  Lowe's to buy all the shit I was going to need because I couldn't find any of it, even though
[58:15.130 --> 58:19.170]  I've bought it 50 times before. And I was looking and I was like, you know, those holes are round.
[58:19.270 --> 58:24.350]  They're like, they're just like, they're just like holes. And then I thought I could just put
[58:24.350 --> 58:27.910]  something, it wasn't like it ripped part of the wall out or anything, you know, it's like they're
[58:27.910 --> 58:34.030]  clean holes. They're just huge. Isn't a hole by default typically round? Is a hole round by default?
[58:34.030 --> 58:40.530]  No, because dead people go in and not a round hole. Yeah. Dead people go in six foot holes by
[58:40.530 --> 58:46.790]  like two foot holes. Yeah. Uh, probably three feet, but yeah. Okay. I don't think every hole is round.
[58:46.870 --> 58:50.750]  I don't think a hole has to be round. Uh, anyway, if they wouldn't have been round, it wouldn't
[58:50.750 --> 58:54.290]  have worked, but because they were round holes and I was like, it just struck me all at once.
[58:54.430 --> 58:58.190]  I just put something bigger in the hole and it's fucking. So there you go. There's your life
[58:58.190 --> 59:02.590]  hack. Put something bigger in the hole. Maybe every time you buy those little rule plugs that they
[59:02.590 --> 59:07.210]  just have a, they should ship like a spare set of bigger sizes for when you mess up the first time.
[59:07.250 --> 59:11.930]  They really should. That's great. Such a bad track record with those things. Okay. The Jeep
[59:11.930 --> 59:15.430]  thing I was going to say, I, uh, this is real brief too, but you know, I've been riding my bike every
[59:15.430 --> 59:19.870]  morning, somewhere between like six, uh, 10 to eight, about two hours. So six to eight or seven
[59:19.870 --> 59:24.070]  to nine, depending on the day. And I'm seeing a different Austin. I'm seeing an Austin that wakes
[59:24.070 --> 59:28.510]  up. Uh, not that I'm not, I don't get up early anyway. Cause when school's in session, I have to
[59:28.510 --> 59:32.570]  take Millie to school in the morning and stuff. So I'm up, but I'm not out in the world at like
[59:32.570 --> 59:37.190]  six or seven usually. And I discovered that the, this is an interesting factoid that I've learned.
[59:37.350 --> 59:45.370]  The only people who are out and about in Austin at 7am who are parking their cars in a parking lot
[59:45.370 --> 59:50.830]  at a park or, uh, near the lake or where, or by a hike and bike trail or whatever,
[59:50.930 --> 59:58.590]  they exclusively drive Toyota four runners and Jeeps. Those are the only cars you will see in
[59:58.590 --> 01:00:04.650]  a parking lot at 7am in Austin near nature is a Toyota four runner or a Jeep. I didn't realize
[01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:09.290]  how many Toyota four runners there were in the world until I started riding my bike at 7am.
[01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:14.990]  It is insane. The only people that hang out at 7am drive one of those two vehicles guaranteed.
[01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:20.090]  It would be interesting to do a survey of like what time it's like, you know, when we play like
[01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:24.250]  GTA three or something, there was only enough memory for like, when you see one car, then you
[01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:29.130]  start seeing a ton of that car. Exactly. Exactly. Like at some point there's a change over because
[01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:33.050]  I ride my bike in the afternoon. Like I ride my bike at two in the afternoon. It's not four runners
[01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:37.430]  and Jeeps, the four runners and the Jeeps, they leave their morning people. So I wonder at what
[01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:41.950]  time it's like 10 o'clock is the shift change. And then the Subaru Outbacks or whatever start coming.
[01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:49.170]  And then it's like the, the, the Hyundai Sonatas and the Ionix all show up. But like,
[01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:54.010]  it's just so fucking weird that it's only those cars in the morning. And then at some
[01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:58.050]  point they all fuck off. And I think you should get out there one day, a little clipboard on the
[01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:03.150]  handlebars and you survey it at about 7am. And then you go out again at 7pm and see,
[01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:07.290]  see the difference. That's a great idea. Maybe I'll do that. Maybe I will 100% do that. I'll pick
[01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:13.210]  one parking lot and there'll be my survey parking lot. And all the people in Jeeps, everybody like
[01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:19.790]  there's always this prick on a bike. It just keeps riding down my license plate. Every park I go to,
[01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:26.390]  there's one weird guy taking a survey with a bike. It's just strange. Stay away from the survey
[01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:30.930]  guy. He's out here every day at 7pm. If you go, if show up at like lunch, that's when the skateboarders
[01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:34.610]  show up. It's really, it's this whole arc. It's very weird. I don't know what's going on with
[01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:39.850]  those people. Do you need someone's permission to count them? No, but it just, it just got me to
[01:01:39.850 --> 01:01:44.530]  thinking though, like, are there times of the day when certain vehicles are more prevalent than
[01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:49.570]  other times of the day? And I guess there are. Yeah. Cause you get like the, the mom,
[01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:53.950]  like school run vehicles. Yeah. Like all the minivans would be at a certain time,
[01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:58.330]  you'd be at 3.30 or whenever you pick up kids from school. Anyway, that was an observation.
[01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:04.270]  Yeah. It struck me. It struck me as odd. And I have one more that is piggybacking off of that.
[01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:07.130]  And I've just been noticing this because like I've said, I'm back out in the streets. I'm
[01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:11.070]  riding my bike every day. Like I was a couple of years ago. I'm, I'm, I'm among the people.
[01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:19.350]  And, uh, this is a, this is just a PSA to anybody in the world who walks around a major metropolitan
[01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:24.370]  area, be it for fitness, maybe you're jogging, maybe you're walking, maybe you're walking your
[01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:29.490]  dog, maybe you're pushing your kid in a stroller down the path, maybe you're jogging, whatever it
[01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:36.570]  is. If you are going around town and doing that with headphones on, you've almost died seven times
[01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:42.930]  and you have no idea. I have seen so many people almost die because they're listening to headphones
[01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:48.530]  and not paying attention and it, and, and avert tragedy because somebody else saw them first and
[01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:54.790]  didn't run them over or back into them or plow into them. And they just keep walking without a
[01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:58.210]  care in the world because they don't hear anything because they're blasting 50 cent or whatever.
[01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:04.130]  And they just have no idea because the carpenters are playing that they almost just got creamed by
[01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:09.450]  a utility truck. It happens at least three or four times a day. I almost got hit in the bike lane
[01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:17.130]  by a fucking car two days ago who was driving in the partitioned bike lane at me. And I was like,
[01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:21.150]  it was a weird standoff where I was like, I have the right of way here, right? I looked down and
[01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:24.650]  there's a picture of a fucking bicycle on the ground and an arrow pointing that way. And this
[01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:29.370]  guy, and I was just like, fuck it. If he's going to have to run me over because he's in my place.
[01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:33.630]  I'm not doing this. And he was in a Maserati and I guess he didn't want to mess his car up. So he
[01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:37.370]  turned at the last minute and got back on the real road, but he had to like, he had to like,
[01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:42.410]  hit a partition. Like, you know, those tall, like plastic partitions that kind of flop. He had to
[01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:47.990]  clip one of those to get around me. They're usually like what separates like a carpool lane and stuff.
[01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:54.030]  Yeah. They separate like the bike lane from the rest of the street. Anyway, I wonder which,
[01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:59.990]  which song people have been run over by the most. Wait, that's it. That's no, that's it.
[01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:05.410]  You know what I mean? That didn't make sense. Yeah. No, I totally know what you mean.
[01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:13.310]  Yeah. Shocking. It's some of the songs you wouldn't expect. It's difficult. You would
[01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:17.210]  not believe the shoe size on Bohemian Rhapsody. You do not want to get trampled on by that song.
[01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:24.090]  Blue Suede Shoes. Blue Suede Shoes. Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:32.870]  Another one bites the dust. Oh God, that'd be a great one. Yeah, there's all those like new
[01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:36.850]  transparency modes now on headphones that have noise cancelling so you can
[01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:43.250]  hear through them. That's what I use when I ride so I can be super safe.
[01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:51.790]  Nick says we have to stop. Oh, okay. Man, I gotta say that the show's been like
[01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:58.170]  flying by lately. Like we've just been really jamming. This one may have been the fastest hour
[01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:05.550]  of my life today. Yeah, it's insane how that works. Yeah, it's like we just sat down. I can't
[01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:09.970]  believe like when I looked at the clock a second ago and I initiated that thing where I said like,
[01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:13.170]  oh, I can't believe it's been 50 minutes. What did we talk about? I thought I was going to look
[01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:15.810]  at it and it was going to say we're like 24 minutes in and I was like, all right, now we
[01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:20.630]  should start transitioning into some bigger stuff or some bits. And I was so surprised
[01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:27.750]  that that time just melted away. It did. I saw some comments, uh, about episode 100,
[01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:33.290]  I think it was 158. Okay. The one where, uh, you introduced yourself as Porterhouse.
[01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:38.050]  A lot of people saying that that's the, that's the, that's a great one to get people in on.
[01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:44.790]  I tried to re-listen to that imagining I'd never heard that before. Awful. Absolutely horrendous.
[01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:50.930]  At no point do we like say our real names. You, we introduced ourselves as like one set of
[01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:56.050]  nicknames and then we start talking about another set of nicknames. I can't, I can't imagine. Maybe
[01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:59.950]  they're right. Maybe that is a great one because it's very funny, but I feel like you have to,
[01:06:00.110 --> 01:06:05.570]  you have to have external context about what the hell we're talking about.
[01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:11.110]  Yeah. We're deep. We're deep into our nickname era right now, our moniker era, if you will. And
[01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:14.530]  I imagine that's gotta be confusing because it's identity challenging.
[01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:18.690]  Including this one. You've introduced me as a different name the last four episodes.
[01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:23.450]  Dude, thanks for noticing. I've been making a special attempt at calling you some different
[01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:28.690]  variation of your name every time. I wrote whoopscoop down. Whoopscoop might be my favorite.
[01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:32.770]  I like whoopscoop a lot. I've been whoopscoop, I've been whoopscoop,
[01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:37.810]  ramjam, not to be confused with ramscoop and whooptone. Like, and that's just the last four.
[01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:43.290]  Uh, and you've been Stuart and you've been, what was the other one? Uh, uh,
[01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:46.130]  Errol. Errol. Errol, yeah. My name's Gavin, by the way.
[01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:51.930]  There you go. If you, if you were wondering an hour and five minutes in, his name's Gavin,
[01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:57.150]  everybody. What a disappointment to learn all the possible variations and you went with Gavin
[01:06:57.150 --> 01:07:02.610]  of all the names. It's the least fun. There's so many better options on the field.
[01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:10.350]  Can you imagine having whoopscoop on your birth certificate? Oh, that'd be great.
[01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:16.690]  Maybe that's what I'll call the, I'll call the, I'll call the ice cream gloves, the whoopscoops.
[01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:23.430]  The whoopscoops. That's great. That's brilliant. That's so fucking smart.
[01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:28.430]  I'm going to make them after this. I'm going to, I'm going to get in the lab straight after we
[01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:34.890]  finish filming. Now is your, is your lab next to your bed? My lab is actually the dining room table
[01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:39.270]  at the moment. Oh, that's a, that's a good lab. That's my lab too. Yeah. It's a great lab. I
[01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:45.110]  think as it's similar to most dining room tables in that, uh, it's something I've rarely eaten at,
[01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:51.470]  but it's completely caked with junk. So that is the lab area. How funny would it be if your dining
[01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:55.990]  room table was also my lab? And sometimes you would just come downstairs to mix a, to get a
[01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:59.210]  drink or a snack. And I'm sitting at your table, like, don't talk to me now I'm in the lab.
[01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:03.390]  Isn't that what it was like when we lived together sometimes? Yeah, pretty much. I guess.
[01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:09.450]  Don't talk to me. I'm conducting car surveys. Give me a minute. Tracking Subarus.
[01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:15.710]  You think the paint color matters? I'm just trying to like walk out of the kitchen.
[01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:24.870]  I'm just getting cereal. Andrew would be like, don't talk to me. I'm listening to every state's
[01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:31.070]  song. Oh, I started the anthems. I started world anthems. I'm in the bees. I'm almost done with
[01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:41.390]  bees. I'm going alphabetical. Any standout so far? Barbados is disappointing. How's Bolivia? How's
[01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:47.350]  Belarus? I feel like Belarus, I need to have the list because it's, it is kind of tricky where a
[01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:52.470]  lot of them feel the same. Um, so it's like you create lines. So there's an Afghanistan line.
[01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:58.090]  Afghanistan, pretty good. Pretty good one. Not the best, but good so far. Are you going to average
[01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:03.510]  one letter per week? I'm trying to do multiples in a night, but yeah, at least a letter per week.
[01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:10.610]  How many? Excellent. Yeah, it's going to take, I don't want to take that long. We're playing games
[01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:16.550]  tonight. We're playing games. Oh, what are you guys going to play? I think Halo. Keeping it
[01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:21.850]  a little bit of Halo. Ah, I hope you guys watch the beef. Am I going to join what?
[01:09:23.290 --> 01:09:27.410]  All right. Am I going to join you guys playing Halo? Yeah. Oh, I don't know. I wasn't invited.
[01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:36.070]  Huh? I mean, what time are you going to play? Am I invited? Always.
[01:09:37.230 --> 01:09:39.750]  Well, I'm just finding out about it now. What time are you going to play?
[01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:46.010]  Actually, Andrew went really quiet. Andrew, is he? What? No, absolutely. It's six. Andrew just
[01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:54.730]  said no. All right. No, no, not at all. He said no a bunch. I didn't say anything. Honestly,
[01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:59.830]  what happened? I looked and I noticed I still have Tiger Bomb on my desk and I panicked. I was
[01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:04.570]  like, why is this still here? I need to get rid of this. Here's what would happen if I played video
[01:10:04.570 --> 01:10:10.430]  games with y'all. I would just try to do, I would be stuck in podcast mode the whole time and then
[01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:14.090]  it would just turn into a whole thing. And you guys probably have more fun if you were just like,
[01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:20.690]  just the two of us. I mean, you could use your AirPods though. I could, I could. He could. It
[01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:24.010]  would really annoy Eric because then we'd want to make another video game thing and that would
[01:10:24.010 --> 01:10:28.590]  come back and then that would, he doesn't want that. He does not want that. And you know,
[01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:35.250]  we've talked about it at length off camera and he has some pretty solid reasons for it. We even
[01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:41.250]  touched on it in Sausage Talk 3. I think that's why it's coming up. Yeah. I enjoyed that Sausage
[01:10:41.250 --> 01:10:45.450]  Talk yesterday, but I hope it's not too dry. It was the driest, but I think that was intentional.
[01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:51.150]  Yeah. We were really getting into behind the scenes. The line between Sausage Talk and Sausage
[01:10:51.150 --> 01:10:57.470]  Talk is too, is pretty, if you get my drift, it's, it's, it's pretty thin. And so. Yeah. And also
[01:10:58.150 --> 01:11:02.470]  sausages could be different levels of dryness. There's different moist levels. Sometimes you
[01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:06.510]  get dry sausage. Sometimes you get a sausage that's in a casing that you're supposed to break
[01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:11.370]  out of the casing into tiny little, and then fry it that way. Or you could just buy sausage.
[01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:13.850]  That's already out of the casing. I don't know why they make you do the extra anyway.
[01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:18.030]  Yeah. It was crumbly sausage. It was a whole thing. Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:23.830]  Uh, be on the lookout for a blindside just already hit. We blindsided you with it. You didn't see it
[01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:26.950]  coming. Uh, and now here we are talking about it again, even though it already came out,
[01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:32.910]  uh, be on the lookout for us chucking fruit in a hundred degree parking lot, for some reason
[01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:39.550]  on concrete where it gets extra hot, uh, be on the lookout for my nose flaps and how they react
[01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:45.970]  to surstromming. Be on the lookout for a really dry round of sausage. And, uh, pretty soon we're
[01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:52.090]  going to eat some potato chips. Thanks for listening. And if you would be so kind, uh,
[01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:56.090]  maybe tell somebody about the, this little podcast and how much fun they would have listening to it.
[01:11:56.390 --> 01:12:00.330]  And, uh, yeah, we'll see you next time. Or we'll hear you next time. Or we won't hear shit. You'll
[01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:06.910]  hear us next time. Geoff will survey if you were here or not for next time. It's 7 p.m. or 7 a.m.
[01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:12.670]  I need to know when you listen to this podcast. Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look
[01:12:12.670 --> 01:12:18.810]  at next week's episode of F*** Face. No one likes Clamato. Just don't do the thing. Stories from
[01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:25.330]  medieval times. The horse made its feelings known. Why is the PlayStation 5 so big? And once again,
[01:12:25.330 --> 01:12:29.770]  Andrew does not eat the pencil. All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:48.050]  Man, I, uh, I just finished with Millie one of the worst television shows ever made.
[01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:52.730]  Oh, what was it? Oh, which one? Manifest. We watched all the entire series.
[01:12:53.890 --> 01:12:56.990]  That is a dog shit show. Was that the one where they disappear?
[01:12:57.870 --> 01:13:02.450]  Yeah, they're in a plane and then the plane disappears and then it lands five years later
[01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:05.650]  and everybody thinks they're dead. I feel like that show has been made eight times.
[01:13:05.650 --> 01:13:09.290]  Yeah, well, it didn't need to be made a ninth, but it was and we watched.
[01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:19.230]  Have you watched From? No, what's that? From is lost with vampires and it it feels like it will
[01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:24.550]  be lost with vampires all the way through. What has the guy? I don't know what it's on.
[01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:29.570]  It's a great question. It's I think on like a B network and then it switched networks,
[01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:35.830]  but it has the guy from Michael on it from Lost and it has like one of the directors of Lost did
[01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:41.570]  a bunch of the episodes. It's about a town that like vampires come out at night and try to eat
[01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:47.750]  you and you can't escape the town and it's like people get stuck there. Imagine all of like the
[01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:53.270]  logic and reasoning for why they can't leave the island, but applied to a small American town with
[01:13:53.270 --> 01:14:00.290]  vampires. They say it sounds kind of like that movie 30 Days of Night. Sort of. Yeah, like not
[01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:06.410]  in a in a sense of like, oh my God, we we all end up stuck here and we can't leave this place and we
[01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:11.930]  all were in different parts of America for how we got here. Hey, I looked it up. I don't know how
[01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:17.370]  you found this show. Season one is on Epics and season two is on MGM Plus, which I didn't even
[01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:22.450]  know was a thing. Yeah, that's why when you ask this, I saw a tick tock of it and then I found it
[01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:28.510]  online. That's interesting. I like vamp like a creepy, a creepy show with intrigue. That's
[01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:32.730]  fascinating, but it feels like they're going to drop the ball in explaining any of this stuff,
[01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:37.550]  but they're real good at intrigue. A lot of mystery. Why do they have to drop all the balls?
[01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:43.250]  Why can't they ever deliver a ball? It's all the balls constantly are getting dropped. It's so
[01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:49.010]  fucking hard to juggle. Apparently, I blame you. Why? Why were you into juggling for a while there?
[01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:54.290]  No, I thought I don't know anyone who juggles. I don't think I know anyone who juggles. And I
[01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:59.230]  assumed I thought of all the people I'm friends with, Geoff is the most likely, I think, to have
[01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:02.910]  this skill. And if you didn't have it, then I didn't think I knew any jugglers. And that was
[01:15:02.910 --> 01:15:09.030]  sad to me, which then I'm glad I'm disappointed. It then turned into Gavin. I had a fight about
[01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:13.970]  if you know how to juggle, can you does that make you a juggler or is there further
[01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:20.550]  qualification needed? Like, do you need to get paid for it? I think there's further qualification
[01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:23.950]  needed. It's like saying, if you know how to sing, does that make you a singer? That's the
[01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:30.350]  well, I think that does. I think you that's no, I'm not a singer. No, but like there's a level
[01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:35.110]  if you can sing well, I think you become a singer. I don't think you need you don't need
[01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:39.530]  a leg up. Yeah, but it's not like. Like if you have a driver's license, it doesn't make you
[01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:43.830]  a race car driver. That's true. Yeah. I was thinking my head of like, I know how to ride
[01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:50.070]  a bike. I'm not a cyclist, but yeah, I think the skill itself is almost like the barrier of entry
[01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:56.150]  because just not juggling is catching playing catch. That's like baseline juggling in my head.
[01:15:57.850 --> 01:16:04.210]  I'm real good at catching. I'm a level up from catching. Yeah, absolutely. So I don't know. I
[01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:08.250]  think there's an argument that you can make that a juggler is just knowing the base skill.
[01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:13.770]  What if you could only be one thing like you could you could kind of like in a video game
[01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:18.970]  when you unlock a title and you can change your title, you know? OK, that's a big thing in Gears
[01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:23.710]  of War. I could change your title to like the Unvanquished or whatever, like the Goblin Killer.
[01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:30.450]  What if you could have at all times one title that you could only assume one title? So it's
[01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:34.750]  like you're if you pick juggler, that's who you are. But if you wanted to get into cooking or
[01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:39.350]  whatever, you'd have to relinquish juggler. And then, you know, like what if we could all assign
[01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:45.250]  ourselves one title and that was our title? But we but we're stuck with it. And unless we had to
[01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:48.590]  go through some sort of a process to remove it and then you to pick a new one, but then you have to
[01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:52.230]  abandon those skills. You have to like empty your shirt. Yeah, it's like when you make like a
[01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:55.930]  character in like a Fallout game or something, you get a sub skill that you want to milk. Yeah,
[01:16:55.990 --> 01:17:00.450]  you got to refund points. OK, and we spend them in it. I only get one skill. Is that the thing?
[01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:03.950]  And I have to pick which one? Most people don't even get one.
[01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:09.510]  So if you have a skill, I would. Well, it's like you just set up a really fun game and then told
[01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:13.950]  me I don't get any pieces and I can't play. So I don't know where you want me to go with this.
[01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:19.670]  No, that was that was a funny indictment on other people. Oh, I thought we were playing a game of
[01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:26.710]  what skill we would pick. And yeah, we are. But I'm just told I don't got no pieces. I'd love to
[01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:30.650]  have. No, you've got all the pieces. You get so many pieces. You can just as long as they're not
[01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:35.450]  balls, because I will drop all of us. OK, well, you're definitely not a juggler. Don't we establish
[01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:39.650]  that? That's how we started this. Yeah, don't don't pick that title. You take that. I think
[01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:44.570]  if I trained for six months, I still wouldn't be able to juggle. I just don't think I got that in
[01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:53.650]  me. I mean. Maybe it could be that thing where you just are still like you. Is this you? I mean,
[01:17:53.650 --> 01:17:57.830]  I didn't learn how to juggle. I just knew how to juggle one day. I just realized now I'm not
[01:17:57.830 --> 01:18:03.290]  a juggler. Yeah, but Craig is still in here. So this is like a weird. Just in case.
[01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:11.070]  I just throw this on the back of the like, like a like a post pleasantry. Yeah. Yeah. Why don't
[01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:19.150]  we fade out? I go to this. Bye. Bye. I really wish I didn't take a shit in the middle of that.
[01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:24.490]  If you wonder why I was. God damn it. The one.
[01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:35.110]  The one time I didn't stick around. That was a really fast shit. I was. Yeah.
[01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:38.610]  Were you just like listening in your headphones the whole time? Like,
[01:18:38.650 --> 01:18:41.070]  oh no, they're still talking and you're just trying to squeeze your shit out.
[01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:44.570]  We know where Gavin put his skill point. That's clear.
[01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:49.130]  God damn it.
