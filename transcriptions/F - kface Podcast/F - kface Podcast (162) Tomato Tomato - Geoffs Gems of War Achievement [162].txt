[00:10.850 --> 00:12.490]  Do you know anybody that says potado?
[00:12.870 --> 00:14.930]  No. Do you think Gavin says potado?
[00:15.950 --> 00:17.470]  No, I don't think so.
[00:17.490 --> 00:18.090]  No, he says juice.
[00:18.390 --> 00:20.010]  Right, but are you sure?
[00:20.750 --> 00:24.310]  Here's what we have to do. We have to ask them, but we can't say it first because it could influence it.
[00:24.610 --> 00:26.330]  So we have to say like...
[00:26.330 --> 00:29.230]  I have a cue. So what, we're doing potato too, or are we just doing tomato?
[00:29.810 --> 00:32.510]  Let's do potato, tomato, and clamato juice.
[00:32.750 --> 00:35.510]  Okay, so do you want me to load up images?
[00:35.930 --> 00:36.630]  You want me to get these ready?
[00:36.650 --> 00:37.310]  I got them. I'm loading them up.
[00:37.310 --> 00:38.090]  Oh, you got them? Okay, cool.
[00:38.090 --> 00:40.550]  Oh, that's even better. I was just going to be like...
[00:40.550 --> 00:45.390]  Alright, so we're thinking of a brown cylindrical thing that grows in the ground.
[00:45.490 --> 00:46.030]  That's so dumb.
[00:46.210 --> 00:48.130]  They make french fries out of it. How do you say that?
[00:48.170 --> 00:49.590]  A brown cylindrical thing?
[00:49.870 --> 00:53.030]  Like we're playing fucking Pyramid or whatever that game is.
[00:57.330 --> 01:00.250]  Oh yeah, what's his other word for...
[01:01.750 --> 01:04.090]  Rhubarb? Or he has like a different word for something like that?
[01:04.390 --> 01:05.730]  He has different words for everything.
[01:06.210 --> 01:08.330]  He has a different word for zucchini.
[01:08.930 --> 01:10.370]  He has different words for pickles.
[01:10.570 --> 01:11.530]  What's the word for it?
[01:13.490 --> 01:16.450]  I don't remember. It was insane. It was a crazy word.
[01:16.930 --> 01:17.770]  There he is!
[01:18.090 --> 01:20.810]  Gavin, we have some important questions for you.
[01:21.050 --> 01:21.970]  Hey, what's up Gavin?
[01:22.750 --> 01:28.050]  Okay, I'm going to show you an image of something, and you're going to need to tell me how you say it.
[01:28.390 --> 01:28.770]  That's all?
[01:28.930 --> 01:29.750]  Just say it.
[01:30.510 --> 01:34.450]  Here's the first thing. What is this person wearing? What is that?
[01:34.510 --> 01:34.890]  Tomato.
[01:35.650 --> 01:35.930]  Wow!
[01:37.950 --> 01:38.770]  Save your comments.
[01:39.750 --> 01:42.270]  What is this? What would this item be?
[01:42.490 --> 01:42.890]  Potato.
[01:44.190 --> 01:45.270]  I'm nailing this.
[01:45.450 --> 01:47.550]  And the last one. What is this?
[01:49.030 --> 01:49.590]  Clamato.
[01:50.690 --> 01:52.150]  Have you ever heard of that before?
[01:52.650 --> 01:52.930]  No.
[01:53.390 --> 01:55.430]  It's clam and tomato juice put together.
[01:56.170 --> 01:56.750]  Oh Jesus.
[01:57.490 --> 01:59.250]  It's very popular among certain circles.
[01:59.850 --> 02:02.790]  And you would say that. I fucking knew Nick would like it.
[02:03.770 --> 02:05.210]  It's so fucking gross.
[02:05.590 --> 02:06.470]  Nick likes everything but cucumbers.
[02:06.610 --> 02:08.070]  Clamato juice is so fucking gross.
[02:08.170 --> 02:09.090]  You're drinking clam?
[02:09.910 --> 02:10.390]  Uh-huh.
[02:11.370 --> 02:12.690]  Well, not just clam.
[02:12.890 --> 02:14.510]  There's also an edo in there.
[02:14.690 --> 02:17.590]  It's for making like a michelada.
[02:18.150 --> 02:19.430]  Have you ever had like a michelada?
[02:20.710 --> 02:31.170]  What it is, is like a tomato, you know like a V8 kind of situation, where it's tomato juice, and then it's also clam broth, I think.
[02:31.170 --> 02:35.090]  And then, you know, a bunch of salt and bullshit.
[02:35.230 --> 02:36.750]  And then you mix it with like a bud light.
[02:37.830 --> 02:43.450]  So as a broth, you just throw a bunch of a thing in there with water and boil it, and then whatever comes out, that's broth?
[02:43.470 --> 02:47.010]  Yeah, that's pretty much it. I think you have to reduce it a little bit, but not much.
[02:50.090 --> 02:52.030]  You should probably introduce the episode, Geoff.
[02:52.830 --> 02:57.410]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[02:57.410 --> 03:01.410]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[03:01.550 --> 03:05.410]  We're going Nick Nameless today. This is episode 162.
[03:05.610 --> 03:07.390]  What if that was Nick's last name?
[03:08.350 --> 03:12.330]  Nameless? Nick, can you change your last name to Nameless, so you can be Nick Nameless?
[03:12.690 --> 03:13.310]  Oh, let's do it.
[03:13.430 --> 03:14.310]  Nick Nameless.
[03:14.850 --> 03:15.570]  Nick Nameless?
[03:15.670 --> 03:19.130]  Is there a profession? What do you think the profession of Nick Nameless would be?
[03:19.130 --> 03:20.490]  I absolutely know what it is.
[03:20.490 --> 03:29.370]  He used to... F***, this is awesome. Nick Nameless used to be a lawyer, but he got disbarred, and now he works as a private investigator.
[03:29.610 --> 03:30.970]  I was about to say P.I.
[03:31.150 --> 03:35.530]  100% writing, hard-boiled noir detective.
[03:35.810 --> 03:39.810]  This isn't Nick at all. I'm not describing Nick here. I'm describing Nick Nameless.
[03:40.170 --> 03:43.230]  But Nick Nameless is just such a forgettable dude.
[03:44.070 --> 03:48.430]  He's the guy that you meet him, and he introduces you, and you forget his name before you're done shaking his hand.
[03:48.430 --> 03:54.050]  And so he's able to just infiltrate shit and blend in, and that's how he solves crimes.
[03:54.190 --> 03:56.810]  Is he wearing a trench coat and a hat as you picture him?
[03:57.470 --> 03:57.770]  Yes.
[03:58.230 --> 03:58.770]  Yeah, me too.
[03:58.810 --> 04:03.470]  As a young man, he is, yeah. I think Nick Nameless gets a little off the edges as he gets older.
[04:04.050 --> 04:12.670]  I think he gets a little unstable. I'm imagining Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State for older Nick Nameless. That's his trajectory.
[04:13.410 --> 04:17.510]  Living in a wire house with a cat is sort of the endgame of Nick Nameless.
[04:17.510 --> 04:22.930]  I kind of like the later Nick Nameless books, I think. The ones where he's in that Gene Hackman era.
[04:23.210 --> 04:28.470]  It's not as exciting as his Jack Ryan days, but it's a lot more of a thinking man's Nameless, you know?
[04:28.730 --> 04:32.830]  And as his body's breaking down, he's got to really use his wits and his experience.
[04:33.110 --> 04:40.450]  He sounds like an exciting character in a TV show, and around the episode 20 mark, he'd have to put his full legal name on some paperwork, and it'd be exciting.
[04:41.050 --> 04:47.050]  You'd see, like, Nicholas Nameless written, and you'd be like, ooh, we've never seen this side of him before.
[04:50.230 --> 04:56.690]  Speaking of Enemy of the State, we had a state draft, which was recent.
[04:57.790 --> 04:58.270]  That's a fucking segue.
[04:59.230 --> 05:02.930]  Yeah, well, I watched Enemy of the State.
[05:03.390 --> 05:12.590]  We had a state draft, and I watched, I felt really bad about it, I watched Enemy of the State as prep for that draft, and I didn't pick it.
[05:12.990 --> 05:17.950]  I had never seen it in its entirety. It should have been potentially my fourth round pick.
[05:18.470 --> 05:22.210]  I felt like I missed out. Have you guys, when was the last time you watched Enemy of the State?
[05:22.350 --> 05:23.090]  I've never seen it.
[05:23.830 --> 05:25.370]  You've never seen Enemy of the State?
[05:25.390 --> 05:26.010]  It's a great movie.
[05:26.250 --> 05:27.070]  About two weeks ago.
[05:27.470 --> 05:28.090]  Oh, wow.
[05:28.170 --> 05:29.710]  You watched Enemy of the State two weeks ago?
[05:29.730 --> 05:38.170]  I was on a plane coming back, and it was on, and I went, let's do it, and I watched it.
[05:38.170 --> 05:42.170]  Enemy of the State is the movie that spawned the whole Zoom and Enhance meme, right?
[05:42.610 --> 05:43.010]  Yes.
[05:43.390 --> 05:48.030]  So why is everyone suddenly watching it? Did it come out in the summer of 98 or something?
[05:49.550 --> 05:50.350]  Shit, did it?
[05:50.890 --> 05:51.570]  Probably not.
[05:51.650 --> 05:52.410]  No, it's 99.
[05:53.190 --> 05:55.290]  No, Enemy of the State, 98.
[05:55.790 --> 05:56.510]  Hell yeah.
[05:56.950 --> 05:58.470]  Enemy of the State, 1998.
[05:58.870 --> 06:01.230]  Dude, the coincidences with this pie, guys.
[06:01.450 --> 06:02.530]  Oh my god.
[06:04.010 --> 06:04.610]  Dude.
[06:05.950 --> 06:06.550]  1998.
[06:07.890 --> 06:09.110]  Holy shit, Gavin.
[06:09.590 --> 06:12.470]  I just was wondering why it's so in right now.
[06:12.950 --> 06:13.090]  Wow.
[06:14.750 --> 06:22.030]  The thing that got me with that movie is that it has a bunch of little freaky weirdos in it.
[06:22.030 --> 06:30.670]  And they're Jamie Kennedy, Jack Black, Barry Pepper, like Seth Green.
[06:30.790 --> 06:31.250]  Seth Green.
[06:31.410 --> 06:32.870]  It's so bizarre.
[06:33.350 --> 06:34.750]  Oh, it's a Tony Scott movie.
[06:35.050 --> 06:35.390]  Yeah.
[06:35.510 --> 06:36.930]  Yeah, I think you'd really like it, Gavin.
[06:36.990 --> 06:37.650]  It's a good movie, man.
[06:37.650 --> 06:39.170]  Very unnecessarily stylized.
[06:39.410 --> 06:42.270]  It's so, it's way too much. It's way too much.
[06:42.670 --> 06:45.150]  It's way too much. The technology is absurd.
[06:45.270 --> 06:46.670]  I'm glad you watched it so recently, Eric.
[06:46.890 --> 06:51.270]  It was a movie that I saw parts of in my childhood a lot, but I never sat down and watched the whole thing.
[06:51.270 --> 06:52.290]  I watched it.
[06:52.530 --> 06:55.950]  I've never seen a movie have such a forced last act.
[06:56.470 --> 07:04.470]  Like, the thing that causes everything to fall apart in the last act is completely unnecessary and random and makes no sense.
[07:04.590 --> 07:05.530]  It is brush it off.
[07:05.850 --> 07:07.430]  It's a wild watching experience.
[07:07.470 --> 07:10.750]  Do you think there was some scenes cut that made no sense?
[07:10.770 --> 07:10.970]  I know.
[07:11.670 --> 07:12.110]  I don't.
[07:12.170 --> 07:19.090]  I just don't think the script, like, they didn't know how to, they put the characters in a position that they didn't know how to get them out of.
[07:19.090 --> 07:27.350]  So they just had one character do something completely irrationally for no reason and cause, like, the entire last act to happen.
[07:28.150 --> 07:28.530]  It's great.
[07:28.870 --> 07:29.890]  You would really like it, I think.
[07:29.970 --> 07:32.550]  I think you'd have a pretty good time.
[07:32.650 --> 07:33.130]  I'll give it a go.
[07:33.610 --> 07:34.470]  It's pretty funny.
[07:34.850 --> 07:38.850]  There are parts, things just kind of happen in the movie, and Andrew's right.
[07:39.150 --> 07:42.110]  They don't know how to get people in and out of stuff.
[07:42.190 --> 07:46.770]  So things happen for no reason and poorly.
[07:47.330 --> 07:47.730]  Yes.
[07:48.210 --> 07:48.430]  Okay?
[07:49.370 --> 08:00.270]  The thing that causes, like, all of the issues of the third act, you watch and go, oh, he planned, like, there must be a broader plan to what he's done, because this makes no sense at all.
[08:00.370 --> 08:00.470]  None.
[08:00.590 --> 08:01.510]  And then it's just, no.
[08:02.170 --> 08:03.730]  He's like, why did you do that?
[08:03.770 --> 08:04.410]  And he's like, I don't know.
[08:04.610 --> 08:06.330]  I know you told me not to, but I don't know.
[08:06.530 --> 08:12.550]  Which movie plot do you think is the most easily avoided, like, in a film?
[08:12.550 --> 08:16.190]  Like, a movie plot where it's like, oh, they could have just done this, and it would have been done.
[08:16.990 --> 08:20.630]  Can I tell you one that immediately popped into my brain, but I don't think it's the answer?
[08:21.070 --> 08:22.930]  But my first thought, No Country for Old Men.
[08:23.470 --> 08:26.190]  You had a 50% chance of absolutely nothing happening.
[08:27.530 --> 08:29.090]  That's my immediate thought.
[08:29.090 --> 08:29.470]  That's pretty good.
[08:29.990 --> 08:30.590]  That's pretty good.
[08:32.490 --> 08:35.370]  My guess would have been Die Hard 2.
[08:35.890 --> 08:37.690]  They could have just sent all the planes to another airport.
[08:39.970 --> 08:41.330]  Totally avoidable movie plot.
[08:42.010 --> 08:44.550]  There was no reason that they were all circling and running out of fuel.
[08:45.010 --> 08:48.010]  I think the weather was too bad or something for them to go anywhere else.
[08:48.410 --> 08:48.610]  Maybe?
[08:48.910 --> 08:49.550]  There was a storm.
[08:50.770 --> 08:54.510]  That's a movie I've seen relatively recently that I couldn't tell you a single detail about.
[08:54.610 --> 08:57.070]  Outside, somebody gets stabbed in the eye with a thing of ice.
[08:57.350 --> 08:57.990]  That was crazy.
[08:58.230 --> 09:00.470]  Die Hard 2 is such a forgettable film.
[09:00.910 --> 09:01.310]  It is.
[09:01.790 --> 09:05.270]  Yeah, the only bit I usually remember is that they, like, reset the ground level on the plane,
[09:05.350 --> 09:08.750]  so they think they're higher than they are, and they just crash into the ground.
[09:08.750 --> 09:12.270]  I was a kid when Die Hard and Die Hard 2 came out, obviously,
[09:12.790 --> 09:18.890]  and I was so fucking excited about Die Hard 2 because Die Hard 1 hit so hard in America.
[09:19.410 --> 09:22.350]  It was such a big deal, and it was such a fucking letdown.
[09:22.430 --> 09:26.450]  It was definitely one of those, like, early sequel letdowns that I experienced in my life.
[09:26.850 --> 09:32.610]  Yeah, it's got, like, real sequel-itis, where John McClane is just doing an impression of himself in the first movie.
[09:32.890 --> 09:34.090]  Yeah, it's real Ace Ventura 2.
[09:34.370 --> 09:34.630]  Yeah.
[09:35.590 --> 09:39.410]  Which is interesting because then Die Hard 3 comes back and is the...
[09:39.790 --> 09:42.250]  I would argue it's a little long, if you go back and watch it now,
[09:42.390 --> 09:45.490]  but one of the best movies ever, let alone one of the best Die Hards.
[09:45.590 --> 09:49.570]  Die Hard 3 is so fucking good, and then 4 is so good, and then it just goes to shit.
[09:49.790 --> 09:53.910]  3 is good. I like 3 a lot. 1 and 3, I think, are really great movies.
[09:54.410 --> 09:56.290]  Yeah, it goes crazy, right?
[09:56.410 --> 10:00.970]  Like, I feel like kind of the appeal of Die Hard 1 is that he's sort of a grounded hero.
[10:01.550 --> 10:04.850]  Like, there's nothing too crazy in my memory of Die Hard 1.
[10:04.890 --> 10:07.130]  He's mainly crawling around events, shooting dudes.
[10:07.430 --> 10:11.270]  In terms of, like, at least action movie logic, he's very grounded.
[10:11.770 --> 10:15.610]  And then by the time you get to Die Hard 4, he literally rides like a jet in motion.
[10:15.870 --> 10:20.150]  Yeah, and then at some point, is it 5, he's fighting Russia by himself?
[10:20.750 --> 10:24.250]  Yeah, I never saw 5, but it's him and his son taking on all of Russia.
[10:24.390 --> 10:27.450]  Which is the one where he reverses a police car into a helicopter.
[10:28.010 --> 10:28.510]  Yeah, that's 4.
[10:28.510 --> 10:29.490]  Or a cab or something, was it?
[10:29.930 --> 10:30.630]  That was so awesome.
[10:30.630 --> 10:32.430]  With Justin Long.
[10:32.890 --> 10:34.270]  He just threw a car at a helicopter.
[10:34.770 --> 10:40.050]  My answer is North by Northwest, a movie that I love and despise.
[10:40.230 --> 10:40.850]  Was that Hitchcock?
[10:41.350 --> 10:43.630]  Yeah, I hate mistaken identity movies.
[10:43.990 --> 10:49.430]  And that is a movie that has the weakest mistaken identity, like, near the beginning.
[10:49.650 --> 10:54.650]  And then the rest goes down this insane path where if he would have stopped,
[10:57.770 --> 11:02.490]  I'm George Kaplan, I'm not Thornhill, and that's it.
[11:04.090 --> 11:11.470]  It's so bizarre, and it happens for no reason, and it just keeps going.
[11:11.810 --> 11:15.430]  Nobody stops and asks a question, they just go, gotta keep chasing this guy.
[11:15.610 --> 11:18.270]  And it makes me crazy. I can't watch it again.
[11:18.630 --> 11:23.070]  You know what? I think that's a great one, and I'm gonna piggyback off that from mine.
[11:23.070 --> 11:26.950]  I'm gonna say, I'm gonna use Alfred Hitchcock as well, I'm gonna do Rear Window.
[11:27.170 --> 11:28.130]  Just shut the blinds.
[11:28.950 --> 11:30.570]  Just shut the blinds.
[11:30.810 --> 11:33.390]  Watch TV. Just turn on the TV.
[11:35.370 --> 11:37.350]  Vertigo, I'll do Vertigo as well.
[11:37.690 --> 11:38.670]  Don't climb stairs.
[11:39.530 --> 11:42.490]  Quit being in San Francisco, dude. Go somewhere else.
[11:43.950 --> 11:48.370]  Well, I don't think it counts if the reason is drive away from the movie.
[11:49.050 --> 11:51.930]  I mean, Psycho? Don't stay at that hotel.
[11:52.830 --> 11:56.290]  Do you guys remember Call of Duty 2? Modern Warfare 2?
[11:56.690 --> 11:56.850]  Yeah.
[11:57.010 --> 11:58.970]  There was the little easter egg in it.
[12:00.670 --> 12:04.790]  The first level is always the introductory level where you have to run through the training course.
[12:05.270 --> 12:06.310]  And you try to get the gold time.
[12:06.630 --> 12:10.030]  In that one, the general who ends up being the bad guy in the reveal...
[12:10.550 --> 12:10.830]  Spoiler?
[12:11.890 --> 12:13.930]  It's Call of Duty 2, man.
[12:14.110 --> 12:18.150]  It's already been remade, and then re-storied as a different story.
[12:18.310 --> 12:19.010]  It's so fucking old.
[12:19.270 --> 12:21.350]  There have been 86 Call of Duties to come out since then.
[12:21.350 --> 12:22.010]  Spoilers!
[12:22.970 --> 12:27.670]  The general who ends up being the bad guy who you find out in level 6 or 7 when you have to defend that house.
[12:27.790 --> 12:30.130]  And then he shows up and starts shooting people after you fucking save it.
[12:30.490 --> 12:32.030]  Which is an awesome level in a video game.
[12:33.250 --> 12:35.850]  You mean Modern Warfare 2 or Call of Duty 2?
[12:36.050 --> 12:37.110]  Modern Warfare 2.
[12:37.290 --> 12:38.850]  Yeah, like Shepard or whatever his name was.
[12:39.670 --> 12:43.070]  I thought you were talking about the World War 2 Call of Duty 2.
[12:43.090 --> 12:44.550]  No, sorry. Modern Warfare 2.
[12:45.410 --> 12:48.130]  But not the Modern Warfare remastered new one that's all different.
[12:49.030 --> 12:55.190]  Anyway, the general is standing above you, like, giving you instructions as you're learning how to go through.
[12:55.410 --> 12:57.310]  And if you just turn around and shoot him, the game ends.
[12:58.650 --> 12:59.450]  Yeah, that's great.
[13:01.750 --> 13:05.430]  They let you kill him in the first 30 seconds of the game if you want to.
[13:06.010 --> 13:08.430]  That's kinda like Shadow Complex did something similar, I think, too.
[13:08.550 --> 13:09.470]  Like, if you just wait.
[13:09.930 --> 13:13.110]  I think there's a way to do that in Far Cry 4 and 5.
[13:13.550 --> 13:14.930]  Yeah, I think you just stand still in it.
[13:15.110 --> 13:17.110]  Yeah, in 3 you just sit at the table or whatever.
[13:17.110 --> 13:20.570]  Nick Crote, the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, they could've just not gone through the Wardrobe.
[13:22.810 --> 13:23.530]  Great movie.
[13:24.010 --> 13:25.870]  Thelma and Louise just don't go dancing.
[13:28.290 --> 13:30.330]  Stay home. Don't go dancing.
[13:30.870 --> 13:31.830]  That changes everything.
[13:31.910 --> 13:33.170]  Is there dancing in Thelma and Louise?
[13:33.890 --> 13:40.070]  Yeah, they go out dancing to blow off steam and then she ends up, Thelma or Louise, I can't remember which one,
[13:40.070 --> 13:46.570]  ends up dancing with a dude who they end up kinda flirting and stuff, and then he tries to rape her and the other one kills him,
[13:46.790 --> 13:50.290]  and then that's what sets the cops after them and the whole police chase thing.
[13:51.110 --> 13:55.550]  Oh, Jesus. Okay. I have zero awareness of what that is outside of the ending of that movie.
[13:56.150 --> 14:01.430]  Yeah, the reason that they drive off the cliff together is because they're being chased by a bunch of dickhead cops because...
[14:01.430 --> 14:01.870]  Whoa, spoiler!
[14:02.610 --> 14:03.270]  Oh my God.
[14:03.590 --> 14:04.450]  Yeah, you're right. I shouldn't...
[14:04.450 --> 14:06.710]  This is gonna be all this episode.
[14:06.830 --> 14:07.370]  You're absolutely right.
[14:07.570 --> 14:09.850]  You're gonna needle Geoff to death. This is really exciting.
[14:11.550 --> 14:17.490]  What character is the spoiler guy, Gavin? Who are we talking to right now? Every time you interject is...
[14:17.490 --> 14:18.450]  Is this an Errol move?
[14:18.830 --> 14:21.630]  He's so busy on the cases he doesn't have time to watch TV.
[14:21.990 --> 14:23.630]  That was definitely an Errol call-out.
[14:24.350 --> 14:30.050]  By the way, I noticed something popped up on my YouTube thing and it was like an old Does It Do?
[14:30.730 --> 14:36.610]  And I realized, in Does It Do? I'm a combination of Errol and Stuart.
[14:39.390 --> 14:40.110]  Definitely. Absolutely.
[14:40.310 --> 14:42.150]  You're like the worst of both of those dudes.
[14:43.490 --> 14:50.850]  We haven't had Eric on since he met Stuart. I briefly touched on it last week about how much he hates Stuart.
[14:50.990 --> 14:51.790]  What were your thoughts, Eric?
[14:52.090 --> 14:57.670]  I haven't heard the episode so I'm not sure what you guys have talked about. I've gotten the notes, sort of like the blow-by-blow here and there.
[14:57.930 --> 15:00.790]  Just that he wanted to get away from me and I didn't even really have to do anything.
[15:00.790 --> 15:05.510]  I was just raising my hands and grabbing motions as if I was about to touch stuff.
[15:05.850 --> 15:07.670]  And you were like, this sucks, get away from me.
[15:07.810 --> 15:14.170]  Andrew, it is like you're at the store and we're just trying to find our stuff.
[15:14.850 --> 15:17.810]  You're just at the store and then all of a sudden...
[15:17.810 --> 15:21.750]  I didn't realize it was Gavin when it first happened.
[15:22.270 --> 15:29.390]  And then it was just getting bumped into and somebody reaching in and knocking stuff over.
[15:29.390 --> 15:37.390]  And I had a moment of panic of like, what's going on? What's at the grocery store? What's happening to me right now?
[15:37.970 --> 15:45.270]  And then I noticed who it was and what was happening and I never want to see him again.
[15:46.910 --> 15:51.270]  Misery at the grocery store. Do you do that to Meg? You don't do that. She'd kill you, right?
[15:51.710 --> 15:53.970]  Oh yeah, I tried it once and she hated it.
[15:57.930 --> 16:02.030]  It's cringe-inducing but not in the way where it's like, oh, online cringe.
[16:02.450 --> 16:10.590]  It makes you physically recoil because there is someone that's just in your space knocking stuff over and you're trying to save everything.
[16:10.870 --> 16:13.110]  Oh, it's the worst. It's so bad.
[16:13.390 --> 16:15.850]  You can physically see Eric's skin crawl in the moment.
[16:16.950 --> 16:23.210]  You know, you display such a level of maturity that I'm jealous and a little bit in awe of Gavin.
[16:23.210 --> 16:26.550]  Like when you say you did it to Meg once and she hated it.
[16:27.650 --> 16:33.290]  I would have done it to Meg once and then she hated it and then that would have been the reason to do it until she eventually left me.
[16:37.150 --> 16:47.190]  And I think it's so mature and I'm impressed because I don't have that thing that you have.
[16:47.550 --> 16:51.950]  I think what it is, is I don't really want to push people's buttons, but I think it's smart to find out what they are.
[16:53.110 --> 16:54.230]  Ah, evaluation.
[16:54.390 --> 16:55.710]  I don't need to be pressing on them though.
[16:56.130 --> 16:58.830]  I want to press somebody's button so hard it breaks.
[16:59.290 --> 17:03.310]  Well, yeah, you've succeeded multiple times.
[17:06.590 --> 17:10.690]  Just imagining having to fill out the reason for separation in that context.
[17:11.710 --> 17:14.530]  It's Stuart, the bumbling customer.
[17:16.050 --> 17:19.070]  The lawyer's like, I'm sorry, I don't understand this. And you're like, let me explain.
[17:19.450 --> 17:20.530]  Gavin has personas.
[17:20.530 --> 17:23.750]  And I don't like number two.
[17:23.770 --> 17:29.710]  I mean, just tell him to do it to the judge right then and he'd understand whatever it is you need.
[17:29.910 --> 17:32.370]  Like I'm fumbling his gavel up the place.
[17:34.490 --> 17:39.510]  One of my notes just says wowed by Smeg, but I don't really know what it was.
[17:39.830 --> 17:41.390]  Oh, I know what that was.
[17:41.530 --> 17:45.750]  That was a part of It Is at the birthday lunch.
[17:46.270 --> 17:49.410]  Oh yeah, where we left off, you guys were going to Medieval Times. How was that?
[17:49.410 --> 17:55.290]  Oh yeah, so we had like a three day period where we had a Dallas birthday weekend.
[17:55.510 --> 17:59.990]  And then the guys came over, and then Vanessa also came over, Superfan Vanessa, on my birthday.
[18:00.330 --> 18:04.230]  And then there was an attempt to get my Jim's Award achievement as well.
[18:04.530 --> 18:07.550]  It was like a whole big, insane, a lot of stuff happened in a couple days.
[18:07.730 --> 18:08.630]  Holy shit!
[18:10.150 --> 18:11.670]  So we went to Medieval Times.
[18:11.670 --> 18:23.250]  It was me, and Emily, and Millie, and Superfan Jack, or Major League Fan Jack, and his wife Katie, and then Gavin and Meg, and then Superfan Vanessa and her husband Bernie.
[18:23.890 --> 18:30.310]  And I have never once wanted to go to Medieval Times in my life.
[18:31.070 --> 18:34.970]  And I have got to say, I was wrong.
[18:35.710 --> 18:37.410]  Medieval Times is awesome.
[18:39.010 --> 18:41.110]  It is so much fun.
[18:41.110 --> 18:45.690]  We spent like three hours there, and time fucking flew by.
[18:47.370 --> 18:49.050]  It was so cool.
[18:50.030 --> 18:54.170]  They're like, lancing each other, and the woods exploding, and the shit going everywhere.
[18:54.390 --> 18:58.890]  And I was thinking the whole time, Gavin, you had to take off the next day so I didn't get to talk to this about you.
[18:59.050 --> 19:07.710]  But I was watching it, and there's like six knights that fight against each other, and then they put you in a color-coded section of the arena, and then that's who you fight for.
[19:09.050 --> 19:12.270]  And so, who were we? We were Yellow Knight, right? We were the pissed knight?
[19:14.190 --> 19:17.050]  And so we were like the Yellow Knight team. We were fighting for the Yellow Knight. He didn't win.
[19:17.350 --> 19:28.070]  But the whole time, with the raucous audience screaming, and the performers taking it so seriously, I realized, I bet the horses have no idea they don't live in Medieval Times.
[19:30.150 --> 19:31.610]  Because they live on site.
[19:31.990 --> 19:37.150]  There's like 24 horse stables, and there's 24 horses, and the horses live on site, and they do all their training there.
[19:37.150 --> 19:42.170]  So for the entirety of the time a horse lives there, it thinks it's in knight shit.
[19:42.470 --> 19:43.710]  It thinks this is real.
[19:44.290 --> 19:45.230]  Because how would it know?
[19:45.790 --> 19:47.730]  How does a horse differentiate anything?
[19:48.290 --> 19:49.750]  It's just got a bloke on it.
[19:49.990 --> 19:52.570]  Do you think the horse is taking note of the attire?
[19:53.110 --> 19:58.970]  I think a horse realizes the difference between a car and a fucking knight in metal armor.
[19:59.090 --> 20:03.850]  They bring in horses, like, I don't think they're breeding horses necessarily.
[20:03.850 --> 20:05.850]  No, listen, I'm telling you...
[20:06.870 --> 20:08.350]  You think they time travel?
[20:08.530 --> 20:12.710]  No, I don't think the horses understand time travel. I think the horses think they live in that period.
[20:13.650 --> 20:16.290]  The horse knows its surroundings, it knows what's around.
[20:16.290 --> 20:18.270]  I don't think the horse understands periods.
[20:18.430 --> 20:19.230]  I think a horse...
[20:19.230 --> 20:20.970]  I think it's all just one thing, isn't it?
[20:21.010 --> 20:30.470]  No, I think a horse that is like a police horse, where the cops patrol downtown Austin on, has an incredibly different view of the world than a horse that only lives in Medieval Times,
[20:30.470 --> 20:34.290]  and thinks that people fucking fight each other with swords all night long.
[20:34.570 --> 20:44.590]  I think that's ridiculous, and it's the same as if you were just out in the open, and someone showed you a horse from 2023, and then someone also showed you a horse from the 1600s.
[20:44.690 --> 20:50.810]  You wouldn't be like, whoa! I must be in the 1600s! You're just looking at two horses.
[20:51.810 --> 20:52.290]  What?
[20:52.790 --> 20:59.130]  No, I agree with Geoff. I think the horse's perception of things is weird.
[20:59.130 --> 21:11.930]  Here's why I agree. Because the movie Planet of the Apes was filmed, and you have to think those horses don't know what the fuck is going on when the monkeys are riding the horses and attacking the people.
[21:12.050 --> 21:12.690]  Totally agree.
[21:14.290 --> 21:21.910]  And if you showed those horses, and had them talk to the Medieval Times horses, completely weird perspectives.
[21:22.110 --> 21:26.430]  They'd be like, what is your world like? And they're like, it's insane.
[21:27.370 --> 21:36.030]  That's the first time anyone has ever said, I think somebody's right, and here's why, Planet of the Apes. That's never happened. That's never been used as an argument before.
[21:36.070 --> 21:38.970]  I bet it will be from now on, going forward.
[21:39.350 --> 21:40.210]  I agree with you, Geoff.
[21:41.810 --> 21:44.490]  Those horses think they live in olden times.
[21:46.750 --> 21:48.630]  I don't think they know times.
[21:48.750 --> 21:55.370]  That's my point. They can't recognize the difference between different types of humans, as we were different horses from different periods.
[21:55.370 --> 21:58.210]  I think you're underselling a horse's intelligence.
[21:58.970 --> 22:03.550]  What was crazy to me is that two of the six knights were fans.
[22:03.910 --> 22:04.850]  Oh, wow.
[22:05.430 --> 22:07.170]  Yeah, they knew who we were. It was great.
[22:07.290 --> 22:07.910]  Which colors?
[22:08.190 --> 22:09.890]  The yellow piston knight gave me a rose.
[22:10.670 --> 22:11.530]  That was sweet.
[22:11.530 --> 22:11.770]  That's great.
[22:12.450 --> 22:14.290]  I feel like I'm represented there, too. It's nice.
[22:14.490 --> 22:17.670]  Dude, we saw so many horses take so many dumps.
[22:17.670 --> 22:23.750]  Dude, the first we sit down, all the horses get introduced.
[22:24.650 --> 22:29.810]  And then just around the time it's all starting, the soup course gets brought out.
[22:29.950 --> 22:33.470]  And it's all very rustic. You eat with your hands and sip out of a bowl sort of stuff.
[22:33.850 --> 22:43.450]  And we were all, as our starter, treated to a lovely bowl of tomato bisque with giant wafts of horseshit.
[22:43.570 --> 22:46.090]  The second the bowls landed on the bench in front of us,
[22:46.090 --> 22:52.210]  the yellow knight's horse took 16 dump bowls right in front of Geoff.
[22:53.130 --> 22:57.130]  This horse was maybe five feet away from us. We were in the front row.
[22:58.450 --> 23:02.790]  And the knight just looked back at all the turds coming out and just patted the horse.
[23:03.630 --> 23:04.230]  Good boy.
[23:05.630 --> 23:06.430]  What can you do?
[23:07.490 --> 23:09.450]  I feel like that would ground me in the moment, though.
[23:09.630 --> 23:13.630]  That's what you want in that medieval experience. That was a real medieval experience you just had.
[23:13.710 --> 23:14.010]  It was.
[23:14.010 --> 23:16.350]  By far the worst soup I've ever had.
[23:16.990 --> 23:23.090]  And it would taste tremendous, but the experience, the smell really, really soured the meal.
[23:24.190 --> 23:26.070]  But yeah, very authentic. Loved it.
[23:26.430 --> 23:27.130]  That's fantastic.
[23:27.490 --> 23:33.390]  It's wild. They were telling us that one of the dudes that worked there has been working there for 25 years as a knight.
[23:33.870 --> 23:37.550]  Oh, wow. Is it random? Do you know, like, who wins, who loses?
[23:37.570 --> 23:39.530]  They work it out ahead of time and they rotate.
[23:39.530 --> 23:43.170]  He hasn't gotten promoted to king? 25 years?
[23:44.210 --> 23:46.290]  It's one of those things where you become too good at your job.
[23:47.130 --> 23:52.150]  It's just like how Tom Cruise couldn't get promoted in the jet movie.
[23:52.830 --> 23:53.390]  What's that movie called?
[23:55.010 --> 23:56.330]  Days of Plane Thunder?
[23:56.730 --> 23:58.250]  Top Gun! There you go.
[23:58.650 --> 24:00.730]  Yeah, it's just like how Tom Cruise could never get promoted in Top Gun.
[24:01.130 --> 24:03.970]  He was too good as a fighter pilot. That's all he wanted to do.
[24:04.450 --> 24:06.590]  Maybe the knight just wants to defend the realm.
[24:06.590 --> 24:11.130]  There's also someone outside of the arena who was kind of telling people where to go and stuff.
[24:11.210 --> 24:14.790]  But in, you know, an in-character voice, doing the old, like, old-timey knight voice.
[24:15.010 --> 24:18.650]  And he came up and said he was a listener as well.
[24:18.890 --> 24:21.430]  And I was like, oh, you listen to F*** Face?
[24:21.830 --> 24:26.770]  And it's just so weird watching someone in all that old-timey garb just snap out a character and be like,
[24:26.830 --> 24:28.730]  Oh, yeah, I love F*** Face. It's great.
[24:29.190 --> 24:31.990]  There's like kids around. It's so funny when people do that.
[24:33.630 --> 24:36.230]  There's no PG way to talk about our podcast.
[24:37.230 --> 24:41.170]  So you guys went to medieval times and had a great time.
[24:41.510 --> 24:43.110]  And then what else did you do Dallas weekend?
[24:43.230 --> 24:46.090]  Oh, well, then Gavin had to go back. He and Meg had another thing they had to go to.
[24:46.310 --> 24:50.690]  So the rest of us the next day went horse racing at the horse track, which I've, you know,
[24:50.710 --> 24:55.630]  I've done gambling on horses in Vegas at the Sportsbook, but I've never been to a horse track before.
[24:55.890 --> 24:58.590]  And man, let me tell you, I had an impression of what it was.
[24:58.590 --> 24:59.790]  And that impression was wrong.
[25:00.210 --> 25:04.910]  I had an impression of a bunch of, like, grizzled old dudes with five o'clock shadow
[25:04.910 --> 25:10.610]  wearing like checkered jackets with like racing forms in their hands, smoking cigarettes and being half homeless
[25:10.610 --> 25:16.790]  and just looking dirty and like throwing papers on the ground every time they lose and like clinging to tickets.
[25:16.970 --> 25:19.610]  And it was actually really f***ing nice, like gorgeous.
[25:19.930 --> 25:21.410]  The food was amazing.
[25:21.990 --> 25:24.190]  It was we were sitting inside. It was air conditioned.
[25:24.730 --> 25:27.710]  But one of the funniest things, well, two f***ing awesome things happened.
[25:28.090 --> 25:32.330]  One point, one of the races that Vanessa actually won and I got second place.
[25:33.330 --> 25:36.970]  They changed the results because they slowed it down and they showed on the replay.
[25:37.710 --> 25:42.050]  Her jockey hit my jockey with his riding crop like three times.
[25:42.230 --> 25:43.770]  Whack, whack, whack, like attacked him.
[25:44.210 --> 25:45.550]  And so they disqualified that dude.
[25:45.910 --> 25:47.910]  And I ended up winning a race that I didn't initially win.
[25:48.810 --> 25:49.170]  Wow.
[25:49.310 --> 25:53.670]  And then the other thing that happened is on the last race, as they like put the horses in the stanchion,
[25:54.010 --> 25:56.950]  one of the horses did not want to go into like the starting gate.
[25:57.010 --> 25:59.190]  And he like reared up and he knocked his rider off.
[25:59.190 --> 26:03.550]  And then he slammed into the horse next to him, which knocked that horse's rider off.
[26:03.910 --> 26:10.730]  And then he turned around and just f***ing left and took off down the track going backwards the wrong way.
[26:10.870 --> 26:14.030]  He went about, I'd say half of a track.
[26:14.130 --> 26:19.370]  And then he just took off through a gate like an open gate and disappeared off into the woods somewhere.
[26:19.470 --> 26:22.830]  And all the other riders and everybody turned around to go find him.
[26:22.850 --> 26:25.750]  And everybody in the place is just laughing and watching this happen.
[26:25.910 --> 26:28.310]  And like 10 minutes later, they bring the horse back up.
[26:28.310 --> 26:31.070]  And I would have thought like, well, that horse is a scratch.
[26:31.150 --> 26:32.670]  There's no way they're going to be able to race with this horse.
[26:32.750 --> 26:35.210]  He's probably tired from all that running.
[26:35.530 --> 26:37.250]  And they tried to put him back in again.
[26:37.570 --> 26:38.970]  Horse did the same f***ing thing.
[26:39.370 --> 26:45.610]  Took off, swung around, ran backwards down the track, wrong way, took off, like went through the gate.
[26:45.730 --> 26:48.490]  And that was it. The guy just walked up and just took his name down from the sign.
[26:48.570 --> 26:49.630]  And then the rest of the horses ran.
[26:49.810 --> 26:52.190]  But like two other horses wouldn't race after that.
[26:52.230 --> 26:53.470]  So it was a whole thing.
[26:54.390 --> 26:55.330]  Do you know why the horse ran away?
[26:55.490 --> 26:56.110]  He didn't want to race.
[26:56.470 --> 26:58.570]  Saw his cell phone. It's from Medieval Times.
[26:58.670 --> 26:59.810]  He's trying to go back to Medieval Times.
[26:59.930 --> 27:01.350]  He's not a Medieval Times horse.
[27:01.370 --> 27:01.890]  He didn't know this world.
[27:02.050 --> 27:02.530]  He's not a Medieval Times horse.
[27:02.550 --> 27:03.250]  He didn't know this world.
[27:03.470 --> 27:06.190]  He saw a phone. He saw a modern thing. He saw a hat.
[27:06.610 --> 27:07.270]  They have hats.
[27:07.390 --> 27:09.730]  A bucket hat and was like, this isn't where I live.
[27:09.890 --> 27:10.950]  I don't know what a bucket hat is.
[27:10.970 --> 27:12.250]  They had hats in the olden times.
[27:12.410 --> 27:15.450]  He heard Taylor Swift and he had to retrieve or run back to home.
[27:15.810 --> 27:16.850]  Not retrieve, but retreat.
[27:17.170 --> 27:18.170]  It's fine, but I'm right.
[27:18.570 --> 27:19.790]  The horses have a different experience.
[27:20.030 --> 27:22.010]  I put the pitch up of how close...
[27:22.010 --> 27:23.830]  Oh, that's like on the plate.
[27:23.830 --> 27:26.210]  Oh, I didn't realize.
[27:26.650 --> 27:27.390]  Ridiculously close.
[27:27.510 --> 27:29.750]  He wasn't lying. It was about five feet.
[27:29.870 --> 27:32.390]  And just the wafts right in our face.
[27:33.370 --> 27:34.190]  It was fucking awesome.
[27:34.630 --> 27:35.490]  That's amazing.
[27:37.050 --> 27:38.250]  It was a great experience.
[27:38.510 --> 27:42.710]  I definitely, I highly recommend anybody go see a Medieval Times show.
[27:42.890 --> 27:43.290]  It's very fun.
[27:43.810 --> 27:45.830]  So then that was the big Dallas weekend.
[27:46.490 --> 27:50.670]  But then we celebrated your birthday the next day.
[27:51.150 --> 27:53.430]  Well, I mean, we kind of, it was more just I wanted to get that achievement.
[27:53.430 --> 27:55.090]  And it just happened to be on my birthday.
[27:55.350 --> 27:56.490]  And so it seemed appropriate.
[27:57.150 --> 27:59.670]  Wait, so you have the, did you get the achievement?
[27:59.950 --> 28:01.570]  I sat down to get the achievement.
[28:01.770 --> 28:05.530]  But with Gavin and Eric were there and Emily and Millie, of course.
[28:05.590 --> 28:07.370]  And then Superfan Vanessa.
[28:08.410 --> 28:10.150]  And I looked up some stuff.
[28:10.670 --> 28:16.090]  I got the, the achievement came out December 11th, 2019.
[28:17.090 --> 28:23.370]  And so three years, six months and seven days after that day, I got the achievement.
[28:24.230 --> 28:24.630]  Wow!
[28:25.650 --> 28:26.290]  Yeah, it was a real.
[28:26.290 --> 28:26.910]  That's amazing.
[28:27.130 --> 28:28.510]  Real underwhelming thing.
[28:28.610 --> 28:30.850]  I just, I had to hit three buttons.
[28:31.110 --> 28:31.570]  And then it was like.
[28:31.570 --> 28:35.710]  He made us, he made us stand around on his birthday.
[28:36.270 --> 28:38.750]  So we could watch him get the achievement.
[28:38.970 --> 28:40.950]  And we all had to clap and film it.
[28:41.190 --> 28:41.970]  None of that happened.
[28:42.290 --> 28:43.130]  None of that happened.
[28:44.230 --> 28:45.090]  None of that happened.
[28:45.390 --> 28:46.370]  Gavin, were we all there?
[28:46.430 --> 28:47.030]  Did we film it?
[28:47.370 --> 28:49.850]  I filmed it and I was unironically clapping.
[28:50.670 --> 28:52.290]  Yeah, but I didn't demand any of that.
[28:52.290 --> 28:56.790]  On his birthday, he made us gather so he could play his video game.
[28:56.850 --> 28:59.070]  He made us watch and we had to film it.
[28:59.490 --> 29:01.410]  And then Eric got really impressed with Smeg.
[29:01.930 --> 29:05.370]  I just think it's weird that something's called Smeg and it's in your kitchen.
[29:06.030 --> 29:07.290]  What is Smeg?
[29:08.230 --> 29:09.810]  It's, it's a line of products.
[29:09.910 --> 29:10.450]  Is that right, Gavin?
[29:10.510 --> 29:11.610]  It's like an appliance brand.
[29:11.790 --> 29:14.850]  Yeah, I think it's like a, was it like an Italian company that makes kitchen shit?
[29:15.830 --> 29:18.370]  Yeah, I think it was, was it a kettle?
[29:18.950 --> 29:19.610]  Tea kettle, yeah.
[29:19.610 --> 29:28.690]  Yeah, and it just said, it just said Smeg, which to me is very weird, I guess.
[29:30.410 --> 29:34.950]  It's just too close of a name to, it's just gross.
[29:35.110 --> 29:36.890]  And I think it's weird that that's what it's called.
[29:37.330 --> 29:38.050]  Too close to what?
[29:39.870 --> 29:40.870]  Meg, I guess?
[29:41.170 --> 29:41.870]  No, like...
[29:42.190 --> 29:42.710]  Smegma?
[29:43.150 --> 29:47.430]  Yes, it's that. And it's...
[29:47.430 --> 29:52.630]  Like, Smeg is short for Smegma in conversation. It basically just is Smeg.
[29:54.070 --> 29:58.970]  Right, so that's, so you walk into a kitchen and you just see that and you go, I don't want to know what's in there.
[30:00.150 --> 30:00.570]  Yeah.
[30:01.330 --> 30:01.750]  See?
[30:01.990 --> 30:02.530]  That's fair.
[30:02.610 --> 30:07.430]  Yeah, right, that's all I'm saying. You know, yeah, Nick says yucky and that's, that's all I was thinking.
[30:07.510 --> 30:16.850]  I think, and this is a dumb qualifier, but I don't want it on curved products because I don't know necessarily that it stops at the G in what you just said.
[30:16.850 --> 30:17.550]  That's all I'm saying.
[30:17.550 --> 30:26.770]  If it's like a fridge or like an oven where I can see everything and it's up front, it's flat, it's there. But as soon as you add curvature, Smeg becomes a real bomb.
[30:26.770 --> 30:29.430]  Like, if you can't verify the lack of ma around the corner.
[30:29.570 --> 30:37.210]  Yeah, I don't know if there's anything beyond that G, depending on the angle I'm at when looking at that thing. And that could be a real problem.
[30:38.230 --> 30:39.630]  I agree with Eric on this one.
[30:40.290 --> 30:41.030]  Well, thank you.
[30:41.230 --> 30:41.450]  Hey!
[30:41.710 --> 30:41.970]  Yeah.
[30:42.450 --> 30:43.150]  Go ahead, Gavin.
[30:43.150 --> 30:49.190]  Well, if, Geoff, if I got you in the same font, some little metal cutouts of MA, would you, would you put them on?
[30:49.590 --> 30:49.910]  Probably.
[30:51.170 --> 30:53.190]  Yeah, yeah, a hundred percent, because I know you won't do it.
[30:53.310 --> 30:53.870]  Yeah, for sure.
[30:54.390 --> 30:54.890]  Oh, okay.
[30:55.310 --> 31:03.790]  And if you do do it, I had to, I actually had to, I actually, the M on mine is a little cattywampus because it just popped off one day, so I superglued it back on.
[31:04.890 --> 31:06.070]  Said Seg for a while.
[31:07.430 --> 31:09.610]  Oh, I like Seg. That's a good product name.
[31:09.610 --> 31:11.790]  Yeah, but on a curve, on a curved thing, it might say Sega.
[31:11.790 --> 31:12.730]  That's true.
[31:13.190 --> 31:13.510]  Yeah.
[31:14.350 --> 31:16.010]  Oh, that's, yeah, that's worse.
[31:16.090 --> 31:16.570]  You don't even know.
[31:16.710 --> 31:17.310]  Than Smegma.
[31:22.670 --> 31:27.390]  Using the internet without ExpressVPN is like checking in your baggage at the airport without a lock.
[31:27.630 --> 31:33.970]  You think your stuff is kept private, but you never know who's going through your panties, hemorrhoid cream, and sex toys.
[31:34.570 --> 31:37.390]  There are all sorts of reasons why people should have a VPN.
[31:37.390 --> 31:50.750]  One of the ones that comes to mind is when you don't use one and you browse the internet, internet service providers can see exactly your search information and get all sorts of data from you that they will profit and use that information to sell.
[31:51.630 --> 31:53.770]  Other reasons is you browse more anonymously.
[31:54.230 --> 31:57.730]  When you use ExpressVPN, ISPs cannot see your online activity.
[31:58.210 --> 32:01.030]  Your identity is anonymized by a secure VPN server.
[32:01.410 --> 32:03.950]  Your data is also encrypted for maximum protection.
[32:04.470 --> 32:05.730]  And it's so easy to use.
[32:05.730 --> 32:07.690]  You just fire up the app and click one button.
[32:08.190 --> 32:10.470]  It also works on a huge range of devices.
[32:10.890 --> 32:11.770]  All devices, even.
[32:12.290 --> 32:14.470]  Phones, laptops, even routers.
[32:14.690 --> 32:17.390]  So everyone who shares your Wi-Fi can be protected.
[32:18.070 --> 32:22.030]  I also love ExpressVPN because of the ability to view other content libraries.
[32:22.810 --> 32:27.650]  I have been unable to watch The Spelling Bee without it, which is one of my favorite events of the year.
[32:28.030 --> 32:31.290]  But because of ExpressVPN, I can see it and it's awesome.
[32:31.450 --> 32:32.150]  I love it so much.

[32:48.630 --> 32:53.090]  To me, summer is all about kicking back, relaxing, enjoying some good music.
[32:53.570 --> 32:58.910]  Whether I want to listen to Empire State of Mind on repeat or just need to retreat and set my own head for a bit.
[32:58.910 --> 33:02.970]  I love creating my own summer soundtrack by popping in my Raycon wireless earbuds.
[33:03.550 --> 33:05.170]  There's so much going on all summer.
[33:05.590 --> 33:11.230]  Sometimes you need some upbeat music to pump you up before you see people or to stay calm with some guided meditation.
[33:11.810 --> 33:17.850]  I listen to all sorts of things on my Raycons from rain sounds, podcasts, you name it.
[33:18.210 --> 33:21.050]  It's great. No matter what it is, the quality is fantastic.
[33:21.610 --> 33:24.670]  And let me tell you right now, Raycons are the best way to listen.
[33:24.670 --> 33:32.230]  Use earbud tap functions to toggle between three customizable sound profiles, noise isolation, and awareness mode.
[33:32.670 --> 33:36.410]  Raycons have 32-hour battery life, including 8 hours of playtime.

[33:44.610 --> 33:49.150]  They start at half the price of other premium audio brands, but they sound just as good.
[33:49.490 --> 33:52.190]  And Raycons come with a 45-day happiness guarantee.
[33:52.650 --> 33:53.990]  So you really can't lose.

[35:23.110 --> 35:29.090]  I'm surprised they never made game consoles into kitchen appliances, just so you could have stealth consoles.
[35:29.870 --> 35:33.950]  That was always a thing with me as a kid. I'd be like, I want to get an Xbox.
[35:34.330 --> 35:37.030]  And my parents would be like, that's ugly. Disgusting.
[35:37.510 --> 35:42.130]  But if it looked like a kettle, if it was a Sega kettle...
[35:42.770 --> 35:44.390]  What? What do you mean?
[35:44.390 --> 35:49.810]  Okay, I will say, I never would have agreed with you. I think that that's goofy.
[35:51.470 --> 36:00.030]  Until the PS5 is out now, and it is the legitimately worst looking game console that anyone has ever made.
[36:00.330 --> 36:06.370]  It doesn't go with anyone's living room. It's too big. It is goofy as hell.
[36:07.010 --> 36:10.450]  If it looked like a tea kettle, Gavin, I'm with you. Absolutely.
[36:10.450 --> 36:15.790]  It looks like a router or a cable modem from the mid-2000s.
[36:15.810 --> 36:19.890]  Right? Ugly as hell. And so big. You have to take yours out of the box to see it.
[36:19.990 --> 36:22.010]  It looks like it should have Nextel on the side of it.
[36:22.450 --> 36:25.170]  I'm just trying to imagine a tea kettle with analog sticks.
[36:25.450 --> 36:26.830]  No, it wouldn't be the controller.
[36:27.250 --> 36:29.570]  Well, it would be all in one, wouldn't it? If it's the console?
[36:29.870 --> 36:31.550]  I feel like you're setting up a Switch situation.
[36:31.610 --> 36:33.090]  You'd be plugging a controller into it.
[36:33.370 --> 36:35.290]  Where do you see...
[36:35.290 --> 36:36.750]  And the controller would look like a whisk.
[36:37.410 --> 36:40.650]  Is the tea kettle connected to a TV?
[36:41.130 --> 36:41.270]  Yeah.
[36:42.010 --> 36:42.310]  Okay.
[36:42.690 --> 36:45.390]  But, I mean, when you weren't playing it, you could just pop it in the kitchen and it would be fine.
[36:45.710 --> 36:45.930]  Gotcha.
[36:46.190 --> 36:47.770]  And you think that was the barrier?
[36:48.650 --> 36:49.010]  Wait.
[36:49.930 --> 36:50.290]  Yeah.
[36:50.370 --> 36:52.450]  You're not playing it?
[36:53.570 --> 36:54.690]  Yeah, is it a tea kettle?
[36:55.830 --> 36:56.290]  Uh, no.
[36:56.330 --> 36:57.750]  Or is it just shaped like a tea kettle?
[36:57.850 --> 36:58.850]  It just looks like one.
[36:59.490 --> 37:00.250]  So you want...
[37:00.250 --> 37:01.310]  Then why would you put it in the kitchen?
[37:01.450 --> 37:05.010]  Right. So you want someone to maybe mistake it for a tea kettle?
[37:07.410 --> 37:12.650]  Well, look, my parents don't mind having a kettle in the kitchen.
[37:13.210 --> 37:16.430]  But they did mind a big, ugly Xbox in the living room.
[37:16.430 --> 37:16.710]  In the kitchen?
[37:16.870 --> 37:16.970]  Yeah.
[37:17.230 --> 37:20.290]  Would they mind a kettle in the living room?
[37:20.430 --> 37:21.250]  Just on a table?
[37:21.770 --> 37:22.890]  Would they be okay with that?
[37:22.970 --> 37:23.710]  I bet they would.
[37:24.430 --> 37:27.110]  Look, I'm starting to realize maybe it shouldn't stealth kitchen stuff.
[37:27.190 --> 37:28.950]  It should look like a VCR.
[37:30.930 --> 37:31.810]  Easy thing.
[37:32.110 --> 37:34.250]  So you want to have a VCR in your kitchen?
[37:36.010 --> 37:37.310]  Alright, let's cut off the rest.
[37:38.370 --> 37:42.390]  What if it looked like a stealth table, and you could just put stuff on it as well?
[37:42.450 --> 37:42.970]  What about that?
[37:43.070 --> 37:44.330]  Oh yeah, if it was like the coffee table?
[37:45.010 --> 37:46.370]  Yeah, if it looked like a coffee table.
[37:46.450 --> 37:46.950]  Banger idea.
[37:47.330 --> 37:48.290]  There you go. Perfect.
[37:49.390 --> 37:51.790]  Yeah, but why does a coffee table have an HDMI port?
[37:52.650 --> 37:55.510]  Could you imagine trying to take your console to like a friend's house?
[37:55.730 --> 37:57.950]  You gotta strap a full table to your back?
[37:58.470 --> 38:00.450]  This is like the least portable thing ever.
[38:01.210 --> 38:02.010]  I wonder...
[38:02.010 --> 38:02.670]  Disaster.
[38:02.670 --> 38:05.550]  Yeah, I think I might try and hide a console in something.
[38:06.130 --> 38:06.930]  I'll get in the lab.
[38:07.310 --> 38:07.950]  You do?
[38:08.530 --> 38:12.970]  I like the idea of something as physically large as a table, but the weight of a game console.
[38:13.490 --> 38:14.690]  The annoyance of that.
[38:14.930 --> 38:16.650]  How much space it would take up.
[38:17.050 --> 38:20.570]  Midnight launches where people are just like carrying tables out of a bit.
[38:20.570 --> 38:21.110]  It's great.
[38:21.690 --> 38:22.610]  What a terrible idea.
[38:23.230 --> 38:25.190]  Where would you put the HDMI ports on the table?
[38:25.290 --> 38:27.010]  Is it on a leg? Is it on the bottom?
[38:27.150 --> 38:27.910]  Probably just on the back.
[38:29.170 --> 38:30.110]  On the back?
[38:30.190 --> 38:30.350]  Yeah.
[38:30.850 --> 38:31.370]  So below?
[38:31.370 --> 38:34.130]  Yeah, like under the lip of the top.
[38:34.670 --> 38:34.930]  Okay.
[38:35.310 --> 38:38.730]  Nick sent us a video game coffee table right there.
[38:38.790 --> 38:38.970]  Oh.
[38:39.190 --> 38:39.230]  Wait.
[38:39.570 --> 38:42.650]  Well that just looks like a giant Sega Genesis.
[38:42.870 --> 38:43.870]  Pixel Art Studios.
[38:44.350 --> 38:47.190]  I would say that takes my parents' problem and really amplifies it.
[38:47.470 --> 38:52.810]  Yeah, I'm gonna say this, Nick, might be the opposite of what we're looking for.
[38:52.810 --> 38:54.470]  It's a table that looks like a Sega Genesis.
[38:54.470 --> 38:56.150]  Right, which is, again, the opposite.
[38:56.630 --> 38:58.630]  That's like an Xbox that actually makes tea.
[39:01.510 --> 39:03.690]  Although, what if it was an Xbox?
[39:04.290 --> 39:05.790]  What if that's what your Xbox looked like?
[39:05.870 --> 39:07.330]  That would be pretty stealthy.
[39:07.370 --> 39:08.230]  You would not expect that.
[39:08.950 --> 39:10.010]  Oh, they have many of them.
[39:10.110 --> 39:14.270]  Nick keeps linking us to coffee tables that look like video game stuff.
[39:14.450 --> 39:16.350]  Nick, this is the opposite.
[39:16.690 --> 39:18.030]  We don't want this.
[39:18.450 --> 39:19.030]  Maybe overexposed.
[39:19.030 --> 39:19.370]  That's what he said.
[39:19.750 --> 39:22.370]  I do want it, but not...
[39:23.250 --> 39:26.030]  Look at that Zelda cartridge table.
[39:26.170 --> 39:27.370]  What a shit table.
[39:27.630 --> 39:28.290]  I don't...
[39:28.290 --> 39:28.790]  That looks terrible.
[39:28.790 --> 39:33.290]  Okay, I think my wife would hate that so much that she would get rid of me.
[39:33.350 --> 39:35.330]  So, which one of these coffee tables...
[39:35.330 --> 39:37.410]  Let's say you have to take one of these home.
[39:37.490 --> 39:38.270]  Which one are you taking home?
[39:39.730 --> 39:40.690]  Oh, I have to take one?
[39:40.690 --> 39:41.130]  For the audience.
[39:41.270 --> 39:57.530]  There's a NES controller, there's a Super Mario 3 cartridge, there's a Zelda 64 cartridge, there's a Game Boy, there's a PlayStation 1, an NES, and then a Super Nintendo controller.
[39:57.530 --> 40:02.430]  I would do the Super Nintendo, but I'd have to repaint the buttons to the correct colors.
[40:02.670 --> 40:06.370]  The Super Nintendo controller is, like, the worst one.
[40:06.770 --> 40:06.970]  Why?
[40:07.470 --> 40:08.070]  You've got no...
[40:08.070 --> 40:09.590]  All the different layers.
[40:09.610 --> 40:12.330]  Yeah, look at all, like, the raised points and everything.
[40:12.570 --> 40:12.830]  Yeah.
[40:13.130 --> 40:14.850]  They're perfect for mugs.
[40:15.690 --> 40:17.870]  You do have four permanent coasters there.
[40:17.870 --> 40:18.650]  You can make the argument that the buttons are coasters.
[40:19.230 --> 40:19.670]  Yeah.
[40:19.670 --> 40:27.810]  So when you have four people sitting around the right side of your coffee table, you've got four easy coasters.
[40:27.990 --> 40:31.350]  How do you see Star and Select? They look like TV remote holders to me.
[40:32.810 --> 40:33.330]  Perfect.
[40:33.590 --> 40:34.670]  But they're...
[40:36.890 --> 40:42.390]  Why are you trying to hide all your products?
[40:43.530 --> 40:44.610]  What are you doing?
[40:44.690 --> 40:45.330]  Hidden in plain sight.
[40:45.330 --> 40:47.050]  Why does everything need to be sneaky?
[40:47.630 --> 40:49.630]  Oh, you want the TV remote?
[40:49.830 --> 40:51.930]  Fucking shove your hand into the start button.
[40:51.950 --> 40:52.610]  It's in there.
[40:53.910 --> 40:55.570]  Why are you trying to hide everything?
[40:56.590 --> 40:58.890]  As the oldest of us, Geoff, which one would you pick?
[40:59.670 --> 41:08.550]  I'm probably going with the PlayStation 1 just because it looks like you can open up the disc tray and probably store stuff in there.
[41:08.950 --> 41:09.990]  What are you going... what?
[41:10.430 --> 41:14.090]  You put, like, a couple blankets or whatever, you know, you might need when it gets cold.
[41:15.390 --> 41:16.070]  Extra pillow.
[41:20.810 --> 41:21.670]  That's what I'm doing.
[41:23.370 --> 41:27.310]  I've prepared a clip this week and it's a sad clip.
[41:28.670 --> 41:34.210]  I've realized as I get older, I'm becoming more Geoff-like.
[41:35.250 --> 41:37.310]  Okay, I can see why this would make you sad.
[41:38.910 --> 41:39.690]  What do you see?
[41:40.050 --> 41:44.330]  Oh, at some point we should probably talk about the discovery we made on Monday when we were all together.
[41:44.330 --> 41:48.270]  Okay, so it's a couch with cashews.
[41:48.930 --> 41:49.590]  Cashew couch.
[41:50.230 --> 41:53.470]  Now, is this couch a tea kettle or...?
[41:53.470 --> 41:54.770]  No, no, it's just a couch.
[41:55.570 --> 42:02.510]  What you're seeing here, this is just from one of my cameras and it doesn't have sound, so I added some sound on to help illustrate the point.
[42:03.110 --> 42:08.350]  I dropped a can of drink that I was drinking and it made a little bulge in the top.
[42:09.810 --> 42:12.710]  And I was halfway through drinking it and it kept, like, sticking me in the lip.
[42:12.710 --> 42:19.910]  So I tried to push it down, but if you push the top of a can quite hard, sometimes the entire can just completely buckles.
[42:20.030 --> 42:22.190]  And this is, uh, this is what happened to me the other night.
[42:36.160 --> 42:38.340]  So you're pushing into the can.
[42:38.500 --> 42:46.040]  The top of the can didn't push in, the entire side of the can buckled, forcing all the liquid up into my nose and eyes.
[42:46.040 --> 42:52.380]  And I just thought, wow, that's the kind of stuff Geoff would do in front of me when he was around my age.
[42:52.860 --> 42:53.880]  And it's just happening slowly.
[42:54.340 --> 42:55.360]  I think I've passed the torch.
[42:55.900 --> 42:56.480]  Yeah, thanks for that.
[42:56.500 --> 42:57.580]  Enjoy the next ten years.
[42:57.720 --> 43:01.340]  I can't wait to get a bottle cap stuck in my eye.
[43:01.360 --> 43:04.920]  Dude, it looked like you got orca blasted in your living room.
[43:05.320 --> 43:06.340]  The sound effect was great.
[43:06.660 --> 43:07.120]  That was phenomenal.
[43:07.640 --> 43:10.440]  And I was talking to... Meg was, like, reading something to me at the time.
[43:11.080 --> 43:12.120]  And I'm just like...
[43:13.220 --> 43:14.740]  I kept going, like, I'm drowning.
[43:14.820 --> 43:17.780]  And she's like, what is wrong with you?
[43:19.600 --> 43:21.560]  There's a bunch of water splashes all over the floor.
[43:21.880 --> 43:22.600]  Oh, that's great.
[43:23.900 --> 43:24.620]  That's awesome.
[43:25.240 --> 43:25.940]  Oh, man.
[43:26.300 --> 43:27.260]  So you guys made a discovery?
[43:27.540 --> 43:31.600]  Yeah, so when we were all together, we got onto the conversation about, um...
[43:32.340 --> 43:36.620]  I don't know if we've talked about this much on the podcast.
[43:36.620 --> 43:46.680]  But we have been working this kind of supplemental idea in the background of us doing, like, a sports competition thing where we have a tournament.
[43:47.160 --> 43:48.120]  And then we declare a winner.
[43:48.260 --> 43:49.180]  It'd be video game-based.
[43:49.540 --> 43:51.600]  But we declare a winner.
[43:51.700 --> 43:53.340]  We were trying to figure out what the winner should get.
[43:53.820 --> 43:57.400]  And Andrew, you had an idea that I thought was really brilliant.
[43:57.900 --> 44:02.660]  Your idea was that we take the... we put all of our birthplaces on a map.
[44:02.740 --> 44:05.680]  And then we draw lines to where they all intersect.
[44:05.680 --> 44:13.540]  And at that center point, in the middle of all of our birthplaces, wherever that landmass is, we go there and we buy a billboard.
[44:13.740 --> 44:15.720]  Or we, you know, rent a billboard.
[44:15.900 --> 44:17.120]  And then we put a congratulations.
[44:17.800 --> 44:18.980]  Like, congratulations, Nick.
[44:19.600 --> 44:20.380]  You won the tournament.
[44:20.380 --> 44:21.820]  You won the tournament, right?
[44:21.880 --> 44:28.280]  And then we were thinking it could even be funnier if wherever it is, like, let's say it's like Boise, Ohio... Idaho.
[44:28.800 --> 44:30.320]  Uh, Boise's not in Ohio.
[44:30.920 --> 44:31.940]  It's in Boise, Idaho.
[44:32.100 --> 44:36.260]  You go like, Boise's favorite son, Nick, wins the tournament or whatever.
[44:36.840 --> 44:40.660]  As if he's like a local, homegrown hero that nobody's ever fucking heard of.
[44:41.080 --> 44:43.160]  And we just put that thing up.
[44:43.560 --> 44:50.420]  Well, we decided to triangulate that point with all of our birthplaces.
[44:50.480 --> 44:54.360]  And we haven't shared that information with you yet, Andrew, because the results were surprising.
[44:55.500 --> 44:55.940]  No.
[44:55.940 --> 45:02.860]  I don't think I'm the best person to explain the math behind it from this point on, if Eric or Gavin would rather.
[45:04.880 --> 45:07.260]  Um, we had to enlist Millie.
[45:07.900 --> 45:09.360]  That's true. Millie helped a lot.
[45:09.980 --> 45:13.540]  Millie was mostly the one who did this.
[45:14.200 --> 45:16.840]  Uh, and was very good at it.
[45:16.840 --> 45:30.100]  We took the cities, took the latitude and longitude of those cities, and found what our equidistant birthplace is.
[45:30.720 --> 45:37.280]  Unfortunately, um, one of us was born not in North America.
[45:37.740 --> 45:37.980]  Out of bounds.
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.560]  It has made this incredibly difficult.
[45:41.580 --> 45:43.040]  Yeah, really, uh...
[45:43.040 --> 45:43.500]  Incredibly difficult.
[45:43.500 --> 45:44.760]  I really ruined this.
[45:45.300 --> 45:46.280]  We did it two ways.
[45:46.560 --> 45:53.880]  If we were to do it, uh, where we weighed everybody equally, it ends up putting us somewhere...
[45:53.880 --> 45:55.480]  Well, we'll get to that last, I think.
[45:55.800 --> 45:57.340]  Yeah, I agree.
[45:57.960 --> 46:07.940]  So what we ended up doing was taking, I think, all of North America, finding the equidistant point there, and then doing that against Gavin's, right?
[46:08.040 --> 46:08.900]  Is that how we ended?
[46:09.060 --> 46:09.240]  Yeah.
[46:09.240 --> 46:13.420]  And then, so we did that, and then found a place...
[46:13.420 --> 46:17.240]  I don't know if we want to say the city yet, in case we end up using this, but, um...
[46:18.280 --> 46:31.160]  We found a place, and it doesn't have a big population, and there's not a lot going on, and it seems like prime real estate for a billboard, for a show, that none of the people that live there know exists or listen to.
[46:31.160 --> 46:44.460]  Let's just say there's a place in middle America, uh, that has a population of about 900 people, who has no idea that their favorite son is going to get a billboard in a few months when we do this competition.
[46:46.140 --> 47:01.420]  And we also got to thinking, what if, and Gavin I want to talk to you about this, uh, what if we bought a piece of land there, just like really cheap land, you could probably get land for pennies on the dollar there, and we just bought like an acre, and then that became the center of the f***ing universe.
[47:01.840 --> 47:13.260]  Then we could build like an obelisk, kind of like the cool ones I saw from Egypt in Rome, that says like f***ing face center of the universe, kind of like when you go and stand on the four poles, we were in four states at one point, at that one place in America.
[47:13.260 --> 47:23.380]  And then it just becomes like a shrine, kind of like the Prada store over in Marfa, it just becomes a shrine that people can make like pilgrimages to, to go see, and hopefully not deface.
[47:23.880 --> 47:31.280]  I wonder what the locals would think about that, it's like this big monument to f***ing face, even though none of the members have ever heard of it or set foot there.
[47:31.280 --> 47:43.540]  But what you're describing is we're gonna essentially make wild wild country, we've moved into this small peaceful town, this outside forest, they don't like it, but there's nothing illegal about what's happening.
[47:43.540 --> 47:51.420]  No, all we're gonna do, all we're gonna do is put a concrete statue up on our land. Just on our land, and then that's it.
[47:51.420 --> 47:51.860]  I love this idea.
[47:52.220 --> 47:55.440]  So anyway, yeah, we should hold off on saying where that place is.
[47:56.560 --> 48:03.900]  I mean, okay, well, I mean it's not hard to figure out based on, you set up how to find it, and it seems pretty easy.
[48:03.900 --> 48:11.920]  Here's the thing, whatever we ended up finding is gonna be the place, and when people do it right and end up in a different place, that's on them.
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.680]  Yeah, we're not gonna have that argument, we did it our way and this is right to us.
[48:16.160 --> 48:21.360]  Do you wanna talk about where, like, cause we had to round up to a piece of land.
[48:21.360 --> 48:30.100]  So, if you do it weighting all the birth locations evenly, it puts us in the ocean.
[48:31.320 --> 48:34.400]  Honestly, it puts us almost right on top of the Titanic.
[48:35.120 --> 48:35.680]  No!
[48:36.420 --> 48:39.720]  Here's a, I'm gonna post a photo.
[48:40.040 --> 48:40.420]  No!
[48:40.660 --> 48:41.960]  I'm gonna post a fucking photo.
[48:42.640 --> 48:47.140]  It is, it is so, Andrew, you're not ready for how close it is.
[48:47.400 --> 48:49.900]  It's, uh, it's insane.
[48:49.900 --> 48:51.540]  We're at the Titanic?
[48:51.880 --> 48:54.460]  Yeah, hold on a second, I got a lot of fucking...
[48:54.460 --> 48:56.880]  Oh, man, that's a really hot spot right now, too.
[48:57.680 --> 48:58.120]  It's...
[48:58.660 --> 48:59.100]  Fuck.
[48:59.260 --> 49:07.300]  It was, it was a weird realization, because, you know, all the Titanic shit was going on at the time, and we're just standing there like, is this fucking real?
[49:07.860 --> 49:11.840]  Is the Titanic the most high-profile f***ing face? Is it a f***ing face?
[49:12.200 --> 49:12.780]  Does it count?
[49:12.780 --> 49:21.020]  So the little green flag there, and this will be on the Instagram, obviously, is us, and the red dot is the location of the Titanic.
[49:22.040 --> 49:23.620]  That is crazy!
[49:25.060 --> 49:25.500]  No!
[49:26.020 --> 49:32.760]  So we thought briefly, well, we move it up to the closest landmass, and then I guess we put a billboard in Labrador, or Nova Scotia, and we...
[49:32.760 --> 49:35.000]  That just, we gave up on that idea immediately.
[49:35.780 --> 49:41.160]  Yeah, so if the equidistant point between all of our birthplaces is the Titanic...
[49:41.160 --> 49:47.620]  It's close enough to the Titanic that if we did have a billboard there, it would have been the last thing many people saw.
[49:47.860 --> 49:47.900]  Yeah.
[49:48.000 --> 49:48.880]  It is too close.
[49:49.000 --> 49:49.580]  It's too close.
[49:49.700 --> 49:50.880]  It is on top of it almost.
[49:51.040 --> 49:52.180]  That's crazy.
[49:53.060 --> 49:59.240]  Obviously not looking to make light of recent tragedy, but wow, what a stunning discovery.
[49:59.240 --> 50:12.740]  Also, discovered that on the same day that they showed the controller that the guy was using, which was like a Mad Catz controller, which had extra thumbsticks that looked pretty similar to the thumbsticks Gavin designed.
[50:12.920 --> 50:14.200]  It would probably be a terrible table.
[50:15.820 --> 50:16.860]  Oh, awful table.
[50:17.000 --> 50:17.320]  Terrible table.
[50:17.920 --> 50:19.880]  How is your thumbstick journey going, Andrew?
[50:20.180 --> 50:28.480]  So I started it. I cleared, I got the first win that I needed, so I'm now going to approach the thumbsticks. I received them all.
[50:28.480 --> 50:35.080]  Gavin was also kind enough to include a lightning cable, so that resolved that whole issue. I've been using the AirPods as well.
[50:35.220 --> 50:38.640]  Well, it sounded like you only had one, or you were short of...
[50:38.640 --> 50:41.480]  Yeah, I didn't know where it was. I hadn't found the cable yet, so that solved it.
[50:41.480 --> 50:42.780]  It was in a different egg somewhere.
[50:43.360 --> 50:45.040]  It was in a different egg.
[50:45.040 --> 50:55.900]  If I can ever prevent someone from buying a lightning cable, I'll do it. I've got like 40 of them. It pains me that people buy new ones. Just, you know, get in touch with us and I'll send you one.
[50:57.000 --> 51:12.080]  It honestly, it was great to have, charge it up. Sleeping with the rain in my ears, it's been a game changer. I got storms going on. I feel like, because I pulled the fan out, so I got a breeze on my face. I feel like I'm in like a 4ZX experience.
[51:12.420 --> 51:19.020]  Like, I'm looking into if I can get like an automated spray bottle, maybe get some liquid going as well to really get the full experience.
[51:19.020 --> 51:21.700]  It sounds like you're sleeping in a rainforest cafe.
[51:21.860 --> 51:25.340]  Yeah, it is. Yeah, that's sort of the dream, I guess.
[51:25.340 --> 51:27.380]  Well, how do you feel about the fourth Zemention?
[51:28.320 --> 51:43.600]  Oh, it's great. It has added a whole layer. I get cooler. Like, I get really into the whole experience. It's like, oh, it's chilly. There's a big storm out there. I got to stay underneath these bundled covers. Big wind going by. Got to lock in. So it's been great.
[51:43.780 --> 51:46.620]  So is this the most advanced sleep experience you've ever had?
[51:48.040 --> 52:01.060]  So far, I'd say it is. And I have been looking. I do. I don't. It's tough to find like an automated spray bottle that you could schedule, because I just want like random spritz during the night to like really add into the experience.
[52:01.140 --> 52:13.240]  Like, I haven't been able to figure out a way to automate that, unfortunately. But there has to be a way, right? Because at the grocery store, they got the spritzers that like go on and off for a brief time to keep the vegetables fresh and cool.
[52:14.900 --> 52:17.300]  You're trying to live a grocery store experience?
[52:18.620 --> 52:34.740]  No, I just want some rain, just a little bit of mist. I want some mist in my life. But a very, a very like confined specific mist, because my partner would fucking hate this. I'm not trying to get the whole bed drenched with water.
[52:34.760 --> 52:35.680]  You don't want collateral.
[52:35.960 --> 52:38.540]  No, I just want my little zone.
[52:38.900 --> 52:40.340]  Maybe we need a little smart spritzer.
[52:40.340 --> 52:55.780]  I will say it is I felt so bad recently with my fan setup and also like being congested and stuff. When I sneeze, my instinct is to sneeze away. So the fans on my right, the rest of the bed is to my left.
[52:55.780 --> 53:12.520]  I have sneezed at us like four times in the past week and I feel awful about it, but it's unavoidable. I need to adjust my sneeze instinct because I end up sneezing directly into the fan and then it just blasts back. That's been a real disaster.
[53:12.740 --> 53:15.300]  That kind of does what you want with the spritzing though.
[53:17.840 --> 53:24.080]  Sneezing into myself has been the new sneeze I've been trying to get used to. Just sneezing into me.
[53:24.080 --> 53:27.160]  Yeah, I think by default I'm a sort of an inner elbow sneezer.
[53:27.420 --> 53:34.080]  I'm an inner elbow sneezer too, but I always like tilt away from the person as well. And it's it's it's been a problem.
[53:34.080 --> 53:45.480]  So I've been 4ZXing, but I guess the controller I've been streaming on my my Twitch account at Andrew Panton. If you want to watch, I'm going to start more regularly soon.
[53:45.800 --> 53:53.880]  Got my first win on the base sticks. Now we're on level one. I think they're one inch sticks. I think it goes up to nine inches overall.
[53:54.360 --> 54:01.980]  It's going to be a real problem quickly because I can barely hold the controller with the one inch sticks. I thought I'd have a little bit more space.
[54:01.980 --> 54:10.200]  Yeah, from like, yeah. Well, he does that. He does that claw thing. So that way. Yeah. Yeah. For like how I fold my hands.
[54:10.420 --> 54:14.380]  So how are we going to how are we going to like what's going to be the proof that you're using them?
[54:14.680 --> 54:22.080]  Well, there I mean, it's just I'm using them. We established that I'm going to take photos of them. What do you want?
[54:22.160 --> 54:25.400]  Well, there's nothing on the stream to say that's what's happening.
[54:26.540 --> 54:30.940]  Well, no, I indicate what I'm doing. You can't verify, I guess, what I'm doing.
[54:31.580 --> 54:35.080]  We just have to trust you. Hmm. You just have to trust me.
[54:35.780 --> 54:39.480]  But that was established before. It's crazy that you're asking this question now.
[54:40.400 --> 54:46.320]  Well, I mean, hand cam. Well, how am I going to do a hand cam? GoPro on your head looking down.
[54:46.860 --> 54:55.140]  Oh, GoPro looking. But I like logistically. I mean, I'm basing this entirely on your original.
[54:55.620 --> 55:03.400]  OK, no, but here's the problem. OK, hand cam hand cam works for now. Right. That makes sense. I can do hand cam now.
[55:03.440 --> 55:12.680]  Yeah, because I can hold the controller when we get to the point where I'm having to use my chin to steer and using other.
[55:12.820 --> 55:17.280]  How am I going to capture that? I think whatever you get will be phenomenal.
[55:17.280 --> 55:25.160]  Yeah. Stick the GoPro to the TV facing at you. Nobody needs that.
[55:25.280 --> 55:32.060]  I think it's all we need. If it's a if it's like a head cam and then you end up just like filming.
[55:32.900 --> 55:37.580]  OK, but I'm streaming through my Xbox. How am I getting the problem?
[55:38.400 --> 55:42.600]  Well, where's the where's the speed coming in from?
[55:43.380 --> 55:49.700]  That's a good point. I'm not opposed. I just don't know how to make that work. Can I do that?
[55:49.940 --> 55:52.800]  I feel like I should have also put in a cam link and a little GoPro.
[55:53.860 --> 55:59.220]  Hmm. What if I have a Kinect somewhere? I'll look into. Can I still use the Kinect? Does that work?
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.500]  I bet that would work. But having a Kinect on your head might be more of a challenge.
[56:05.620 --> 56:12.660]  Listen, we've been over. I got a lot of real estate up here. OK, I can carry a thing or two. I got a few items I can hold.
[56:12.900 --> 56:22.620]  If you win a game of Warzone with a six inch thumbstick and a Kinect sellotape to your head, I will lose my shit. That'd be the best thing I've ever seen.
[56:23.300 --> 56:33.800]  I will need to get a helmet that fits me. That would be the way. And I'd strap in, although that could reduce area of my chin.
[56:34.060 --> 56:40.260]  See, the thing is, the honor rules are fine to those who know what you're doing, right?
[56:40.620 --> 56:44.960]  But potentially, you know, there might be a bit of virality to what you're doing.
[56:45.460 --> 56:50.600]  And I think a nice visual will really help illustrate that to a passing audience.
[56:51.980 --> 56:59.940]  I don't care about that, though. That's secondary. I don't care if anyone sees this.
[56:59.940 --> 57:08.720]  Well, I think it would enrich the experience of the comment leavers and the regulation listeners, though, to get to see the master handwork.
[57:09.180 --> 57:10.440]  You know, if we just had a hand cam.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.280]  Yeah. OK. I mean, a webcam. Let's figure it out.
[57:16.480 --> 57:20.020]  Why are you streaming through your Xbox for a start? You have stuff.
[57:20.020 --> 57:21.420]  No, I don't. No, I don't.
[57:22.960 --> 57:28.560]  I don't. It broke a long time ago. I don't have. If I had stuff, we would have done video game stuff.
[57:28.600 --> 57:31.420]  Well, this would have been a great thing to know before I spent $60.
[57:32.020 --> 57:32.520]  We've talked about this.
[57:32.580 --> 57:33.940]  Freaking sending stuff already.
[57:35.540 --> 57:38.040]  We've talked about it. That's not on me. That's on you.
[57:38.040 --> 57:39.620]  I'm sure it is. I'm sure I've forgotten.
[57:40.920 --> 57:47.520]  Oh, I guess James Harden is going to pick up his option for $35 million and then explore trade options.
[57:47.520 --> 57:52.060]  Just saw that. 76 years. Don't know. Trust the process, Geoff.
[57:52.320 --> 57:53.940]  Do you know if James Harden has a Kinect?
[57:54.440 --> 58:01.160]  Dude, do you think there are still Kinect fans out there that are still like logging in and using the Kinect every day?
[58:03.020 --> 58:08.680]  I feel like the Kinect, generally speaking, is agreed as like a kind of pointless device.
[58:08.920 --> 58:12.860]  But the last time I brought it up in conversation, I was like, yeah, fuck the Kinect.
[58:12.920 --> 58:14.480]  And everybody in the room loved it. Really?
[58:14.600 --> 58:15.440]  I was like, where am I?
[58:15.440 --> 58:19.340]  I feel like they're still in use a lot, but none of them are connected to Xboxes.
[58:19.380 --> 58:22.660]  I've seen them used in other IR tracking stuff.
[58:23.240 --> 58:28.500]  So that's, I was going to say, I've seen a real uptick, I don't know why, but on TikToks of people going like,
[58:28.580 --> 58:31.120]  here's everything that I use it for that isn't an Xbox.
[58:31.780 --> 58:35.040]  And a lot of it is taking like 3D images for 3D printing.
[58:35.400 --> 58:38.380]  A lot of it is that, which I thought was very, very interesting.
[58:38.660 --> 58:40.000]  And I'm like, wow, this is really incredible.
[58:40.000 --> 58:43.440]  And they're like, it also does facial recognition really well.
[58:43.660 --> 58:47.260]  And nothing ever used it for that on the Xbox.
[58:47.500 --> 58:52.840]  It's just like, wow, this has like so many uses, but it sucked.
[58:53.660 --> 58:56.020]  Really good for finding ghosts as well.
[58:56.340 --> 58:57.500]  Yeah, it's a great ghost tracker.
[58:57.780 --> 59:01.660]  So I don't know, Geoff, you want to get Haunter going again or whatever and grab a couple of Kinects?
[59:02.580 --> 59:05.680]  I'm all right. I think my haunting days are over.
[59:05.680 --> 59:11.120]  We could easily do a quick haunt with four helmet Kinects.
[59:11.680 --> 59:15.380]  If we're ever going to bring the show back, I only want to do it with helmet Kinects.
[59:16.020 --> 59:23.000]  I'd love to figure out how to capture the video from a Kinect, because now the Xboxes don't even have that port.
[59:23.320 --> 59:24.440]  You need like an adapter.
[59:25.140 --> 59:25.560]  Oh, God.
[59:26.020 --> 59:26.140]  Yeah.
[59:28.080 --> 59:33.820]  I like the idea, though, of us just walking around a house with Kinects on our head, verifying for people not haunted.
[59:33.820 --> 59:36.580]  Your house is fine. No ghosts. All good.
[59:36.980 --> 59:38.840]  We scanned it. We scanned the spaces.
[59:38.840 --> 59:41.940]  Right. That's 100% of the houses we would go inspect.
[59:42.320 --> 59:45.620]  That would be the show is just going, nope, no ghosts here either.
[59:46.240 --> 59:47.440]  And that would be it.
[59:47.800 --> 59:53.380]  So, Andrew, does the streaming from Xbox, does it allow the use of a Kinect to like pip in something?
[59:54.280 --> 59:55.080]  I don't know.
[59:55.160 --> 01:00:02.080]  Because if that's possible, I'm glad I didn't send you any capture devices, because I think the Kinect angle will be phenomenal.
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.220]  I'll look into it today.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:11.380]  I can't see them wanting to support the Kinect, considering how it went, but maybe it's still there.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.260]  I'm not sure.
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:13.880]  I hope it is.
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.260]  What a disappointing device.
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.720]  I was so excited for the Kinect.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.600]  What about this?
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:29.240]  You stream to my computer and then I'll stream that feed to Twitch and then you video call me and I'll pip that in.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.440]  Job's good.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.580]  I will compile your stream and stream it from you.
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:41.240]  I'm trying to rep, so I...
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.200]  Stream on Twitch.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:42.920]  I'll stream.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.060]  I'll open your stream on Twitch and I'll capture that.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:45.440]  Okay.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:49.040]  And then you video call me from your head.
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:49.460]  On a Kinect.
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.500]  Yeah, or from whatever, like a phone taped to your head.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.680]  And I'll capture that too and I'll combine them and stream it.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.540]  I mean, that seems like the way to do it.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.780]  What about this?
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:11.040]  What if I stream and while I'm streaming, you stream your hands doing it and it's a dramatic recreation of what's happening?
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.140]  Like a real-time reenactment of what's happening?
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:13.540]  You're an idiot.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:18.460]  You know when a true crime happens and they have the footage that doesn't really line up?
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.120]  You're a fool.
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:24.200]  I'm a fool? You just streamed, I streamed, you streamed, we all streamed.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.060]  It's a dramatic recreation, but it's happening concurrently.
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:33.340]  Yeah, he's reinterpreting, he's looking at the moves, he's trying to figure out what's going on.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:38.360]  So the bit that I sent you, which is my favorite bit, the bit that makes it unique, I'm doing.
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:43.900]  No, I'm doing. I'm doing, but you're showing how it may be done.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.280]  You're just the visual representation of it.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:50.040]  Yeah, you're not actually doing anything. You're not on the battlefield.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.100]  There's no batteries in your controller.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.100]  There's no risk that's happening in your life right now.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:02:04.360]  The idea is that you watch Andrew play Xbox, and you grab a controller and pretend that you're playing Xbox.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:11.680]  Yeah, you know how parents do it to their kids sometimes, or they give them a controller that's not connected to anything?
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:17.500]  It's like, ah, you're doing great. But you are looking at the footage and interpreting it as it happens.
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.680]  You're a fool, figure out your connect, get a hand cam.
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:27.720]  How am I going to film my hand? Once again, we talked, you and I had this conversation on text.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:32.320]  When I get to the point where I'm using my head, there is no angle that's going to make this work.
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:35.860]  It's going to be like trying to shoot around the planet, is what I told you.
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:41.140]  It'll be like really up close, it'll be out of focus, it'll be like what's behind your controller, it'll be phenomenal.
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:42.600]  It'll just be a desk, okay?
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.460]  It'll be a desk, yeah.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.140]  That doesn't play games, it's just a desk. It's a boring desk, it's not a tea kettle.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:49.900]  It's a terrible desk.
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:59.680]  I think, as someone who is all about the content, I think you definitely would appreciate how funny it would be to have a camera on your head.
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:00.800]  I'm going to figure it out.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:04.740]  But if I don't, until then, I'll be streaming.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.620]  I'll be streaming it.
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:11.620]  I'll be completing the thing that you'll say I didn't do.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.780]  And we'll just take your word for it.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.720]  As a baseline.
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:16.060]  Games will be played.
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:17.300]  You know what I play like normally?
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:18.480]  You can tell.
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:23.040]  I don't think I could fake what six inches of stick.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.240]  I don't know what that's like.
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:37.440]  It'll be fun.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.980]  I'm excited, I can't wait.
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:41.780]  I haven't had anything to watch since you were playing Donkey Kong.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.100]  I sent it to you.
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:47.300]  I sent you the, you could have watched the VOD if you wanted to, I don't think you even knew there was a VOD.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.840]  How do I get on this email list?
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:50.680]  I want to see it too.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.820]  I'll send you a link.
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:53.360]  Thank you.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:04:00.600]  I did watch briefly some of your first game, but I was also in the middle of putting my phone into a locker to do an escape room.
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:03.220]  So I was escaping from a room while you were doing that.
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:05.000]  Oh, that's fun.
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.240]  And then when I came out it was over.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:06.520]  Did you escape?
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:06.820]  Yeah.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:07.860]  Did you win?
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:08.480]  Nice.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:17.540]  Now, when you're streaming to Twitch currently, are you talking or are you having somebody talk for you and then interpret in real time what they think you would be saying?
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.480]  If you want to do that though, if you want to handle the voice part...
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.800]  So I handle the voice part, Gavin handles the hand part, and then...
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.560]  Yeah.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.520]  You're slowly winning me over with this.
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:37.560]  Can you, if you're talking and streaming, if I join your voice chat, can I commentate with you?
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:41.820]  Yeah, yeah, if you join, I could make a party chat and then you could talk.
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:42.980]  Oh, hell yeah, let's do that.
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:49.200]  But you, it would be like, everything you see would be like six seconds behind.
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:50.180]  Oh.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:58.460]  You couldn't see my stream. Unless I made, is there a different stream that I, can I stream my TV to you in a faster way than what the Twitch delay is?
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:04:59.460]  I don't know.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:00.360]  We'll figure it out.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:04.100]  I don't stream either. I don't have any of this information.
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:09.840]  Oh, you can just plug in a webcam to an Xbox.
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:11.440]  Oh, well, there you go.
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:13.500]  That's less fun, but OK.
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:16.340]  What if you tape the webcam to the Kinect?
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:26.500]  We used to, one of my great regrets is we were doing house showings when I was younger and the Kinect was around.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.940]  I really wish I would have streamed that. That would have been fun.
[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:33.200]  Nobody would know, you get a little camera, a little live feed into what's going on, what people are saying.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.740]  Watch people perving on your stuff.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:40.660]  Yeah, like walking around and giving comments about my wall posters or whatever.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.580]  Just being like, this space. What about this? I really wish I did that.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.700]  It's one of my great regrets.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.680]  Is that legal?
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.500]  I don't know. I have no idea.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.720]  It's my space. It is my home. Yeah.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:55.980]  I feel like that's a weird gray area.
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:02.280]  Maybe you could engage the services of that law website we used to use.
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:05.140]  Oh, the judges? Yeah.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.160]  Well, they're biased against me. I'm also one of them.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.520]  They're biased against me. I'm also one of them.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.520]  Well, I had to become one of them because they're biased.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.620]  Yeah, they hate me. They're me.
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:21.920]  Alright, we need to wrap up.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.760]  Hold on a second.
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:34.820]  Time of death, 4.02pm, Thursday, June 29th, episode 162 of F*** Face Has Deceased.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.260]  It is over. Let's wrap it up and get home, boys.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.740]  I can't believe that we're the Titanic.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.820]  We're the f***ing Titanic.
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.620]  And we didn't see it at first.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:53.500]  It was later when they were watching a news report or something and Emily was like,
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:56.560]  that looks exactly like where you guys just put your pin.
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:01.760]  Yeah, I think in the video, I joked that we were like right on top of the Titanic.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.720]  I actually have no idea where that was and I was inadvertently close.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.900]  And then it was like much later we discovered it.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.300]  Wow.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:09.660]  Should I make that into a video?
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:10.480]  Yeah.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:15.800]  Okay. I've got to do that. I've got to do throwing. I've got to do port-a-potty.
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:20.340]  You texted me, Geoff, that you made a great discovery that you wanted to share with me on the podcast.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:20.760]  That was it.
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:23.840]  Great, and that'll be a really fantastic next episode.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.860]  I already quit recording. I'm not in this episode anymore. He's just talking to Geoff.
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:28.840]  You quit recording?
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:29.660]  Well, I still have Craig.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:29.940]  And?
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.980]  I quit recording when I ended the episode.
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:32.620]  Oh.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:37.180]  It's never clear when anyone quits anything on this show. I don't know why you would do that.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.720]  That's a very definitive statement by you.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:39.740]  Can I get a leak?
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.240]  And cut.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.100]  Dick.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.280]  Can you taste stuff inside your stomach?
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.340]  Do we need custom silly straws?
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.760]  Geoff gets new shoes.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.280]  And, once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:05.240]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
