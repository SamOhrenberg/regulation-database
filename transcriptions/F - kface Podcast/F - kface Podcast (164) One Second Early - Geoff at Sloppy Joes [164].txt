[00:09.850 --> 00:12.270]  Can I say something that bugs me about Lethal Weapon?
[00:12.650 --> 00:16.430]  So, I'm a big fan of the Lethal Weapon franchise. Obviously, I grew up with it.
[00:18.230 --> 00:21.010]  I was probably like 10 or 11 when the first one came out.
[00:21.730 --> 00:30.410]  In the first movie, Mel Gibson is this deeply troubled karate badass.
[00:30.990 --> 00:33.210]  Who does martial arts constantly, right?
[00:33.770 --> 00:38.050]  He has like this huge karate fight with Gary Busey and The Rain.
[00:38.050 --> 00:40.470]  There's all kinds of karate. There's all kinds of karate.
[00:41.310 --> 00:45.330]  In the second and the third and the fourth movies, he's just a dude.
[00:45.850 --> 00:47.190]  When did he stop kicking?
[00:47.690 --> 00:49.010]  I don't know. It's a good question.
[00:49.450 --> 00:56.570]  They just abandoned how he was like a troubled badass to just make him a troubled guy later on.
[00:56.790 --> 01:01.390]  But they just completely and totally walked away from the fact that he could fuck dudes up.
[01:02.070 --> 01:04.290]  They sort of touch on that in four.
[01:05.050 --> 01:10.010]  He's not a karate badass, but part of his arc is like, I don't have this shit in me anymore.
[01:10.830 --> 01:13.670]  Unfortunately, he didn't have it in two and three either.
[01:13.870 --> 01:15.410]  He did not. No.
[01:15.850 --> 01:17.170]  Are you guys watching my screen, by the way?
[01:17.430 --> 01:19.130]  I'll watch. I'll throw it on.
[01:19.430 --> 01:19.830]  Thank you.
[01:19.950 --> 01:20.490]  Watch stream.
[01:21.070 --> 01:22.270]  Why am I watching your stream?
[01:23.150 --> 01:24.050]  Oh, we're looking at the clock.
[01:25.610 --> 01:26.010]  48.
[01:26.530 --> 01:27.430]  We're just having a watch.
[01:27.430 --> 01:35.430]  50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[01:36.110 --> 01:39.650]  Oh, wow.
[01:40.110 --> 01:42.010]  Wow, that is wow.
[01:43.350 --> 01:43.930]  Wow.
[01:45.130 --> 01:45.370]  Wow.
[01:46.050 --> 01:46.930]  When do you cut it?
[01:46.950 --> 01:48.070]  When does this episode start?
[01:49.430 --> 01:52.630]  You're watching Eric's stream, but showed his clock.
[01:53.130 --> 01:54.170]  You showed up a second early.
[01:54.530 --> 01:55.210]  You did.
[01:55.430 --> 01:55.930]  He was right.
[01:55.930 --> 01:56.850]  He was right.
[01:56.970 --> 01:57.290]  He's been right.
[01:59.050 --> 02:00.110]  According to his time.
[02:01.430 --> 02:07.510]  I was looking at my clock on my bottom right of my desktop.
[02:08.270 --> 02:15.250]  So I was, you know, clicking at exactly 3 on my GPS, and then when I glanced my bottom right, it still said 2.59.
[02:15.870 --> 02:16.310]  Interesting.
[02:16.430 --> 02:18.110]  And then it instantly changed, though.
[02:18.450 --> 02:19.130]  Very interesting.
[02:19.530 --> 02:20.910]  So I might be one second out.
[02:21.270 --> 02:21.730]  Interesting.
[02:22.250 --> 02:24.090]  You're saying that that was the definitive one second?
[02:24.570 --> 02:24.970]  Yeah.
[02:25.170 --> 02:27.650]  You've been showing up one second early for a while now, dude.
[02:28.410 --> 02:29.210]  163 episodes.
[02:31.410 --> 02:34.530]  Now, you hate people showing up early, Gavin.
[02:34.590 --> 02:35.910]  Are you okay with one second early?
[02:36.010 --> 02:36.970]  How do you feel about yourself?
[02:37.450 --> 02:39.530]  I think one second is a nice grace period to have.
[02:40.470 --> 02:40.830]  Good.
[02:44.530 --> 02:44.930]  Convenient.
[02:46.230 --> 02:48.830]  You know, you don't get up anyone's ass with one second, do you?
[02:49.410 --> 02:49.810]  No.
[02:50.150 --> 02:52.210]  You're not getting up anyone's ass.
[02:54.230 --> 02:55.550]  I guess it depends, right?
[02:55.610 --> 02:57.450]  Like, the Olympics, a second is pretty big.
[02:57.950 --> 03:01.230]  Running the 40, if you're like a prospect, a second could be big.
[03:01.450 --> 03:01.670]  Yeah?
[03:02.290 --> 03:02.730]  Speedruns?
[03:03.450 --> 03:04.090]  Speedruns, yeah.
[03:04.490 --> 03:07.130]  People will spend a year shaving off a second.
[03:07.550 --> 03:07.970]  That's true.
[03:08.250 --> 03:09.010]  Dodging bullets.
[03:16.730 --> 03:18.610]  Not many people have dodged bullets.
[03:19.410 --> 03:22.850]  Yeah, has anyone actually dodged a bullet successfully?
[03:23.070 --> 03:25.170]  Like, it was gonna hit them, and then they moved.
[03:25.170 --> 03:25.950]  Yeah!
[03:26.250 --> 03:28.530]  Nemo Williams, The Adventure Begins, watch it.
[03:28.950 --> 03:32.490]  He did that, Neo did that, Jet Li does that in Lethal Weapon 4.
[03:33.130 --> 03:34.090]  There's a few of them.
[03:35.990 --> 03:39.470]  Jet Li dodges a bullet so his brother can take it, which is like, rough.
[03:39.550 --> 03:40.530]  That's a rough dodge.
[03:40.810 --> 03:41.150]  That is rough.
[03:41.150 --> 03:42.230]  That's maybe the worst dodge.
[03:42.510 --> 03:45.330]  I feel like you're only getting it done from, like, a sniper.
[03:45.750 --> 03:46.310]  Oh, no.
[03:46.410 --> 03:49.670]  You need a lot of distance between you and the gun to actually dodge the bullet, I think.
[03:49.810 --> 03:50.970]  Oh, I disagree strongly.
[03:51.190 --> 03:53.750]  Most of the dodges I can think of don't involve a sniper.
[03:54.110 --> 03:54.570]  That's true.
[03:54.570 --> 03:57.210]  I'm looking at pistols, I'm looking at assault rifles.
[03:57.490 --> 03:58.590]  I think they're all bollocks.
[03:59.290 --> 04:01.330]  Oh, you think Remo Williams is a bollocks?
[04:01.790 --> 04:02.230]  How dare you, sir.
[04:02.230 --> 04:06.490]  You've obviously never seen Remo Williams. You would not think that he was bollocks after you watched that film.
[04:06.590 --> 04:08.190]  I haven't seen Remo Williams.
[04:10.090 --> 04:12.130]  I wonder how many of our audience has.
[04:12.130 --> 04:13.290]  It's Fred Ward, man.
[04:13.910 --> 04:14.590]  It is Fred Ward.
[04:14.810 --> 04:15.290]  I love Fred Ward.
[04:15.630 --> 04:18.590]  Yeah, he's great. He's fucking awesome. He was Remo Williams, Gavin.
[04:20.130 --> 04:21.070]  An American hero.
[04:21.430 --> 04:21.990]  Well, now I'm in.
[04:21.990 --> 04:25.850]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[04:26.830 --> 04:33.450]  This is episode 164. You are welcome, Eric. He was losing his shit in the chat because we hadn't done the intro yet.
[04:33.510 --> 04:36.630]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free.
[04:38.370 --> 04:41.490]  Episode 164, I think I already said that. I got nothing. What do you guys want to talk about?
[04:42.210 --> 04:46.090]  I feel like you have the most of us here. We haven't talked in a little while.
[04:46.350 --> 04:48.930]  Well, I haven't talked to you in just as long as you haven't talked to me.
[04:48.930 --> 04:53.810]  I know, but you've been on some recorded adventures since we've last spoken.
[04:53.910 --> 04:54.970]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[04:55.090 --> 04:56.510]  You don't know what I'm talking about?
[04:56.590 --> 05:00.630]  Why don't we talk about your recorded adventures? What have you been doing the last two weeks, Andrew? I've missed you.
[05:00.750 --> 05:05.910]  Listen, I've been in the lab, okay? My stuff isn't as... Do you want to go to my stuff immediately? What I've been working on?
[05:06.130 --> 05:08.530]  I mean, if you had two weeks in the lab, I would have got straight to that.
[05:08.550 --> 05:09.770]  Yeah, that seems pretty fucking important to me.
[05:09.770 --> 05:14.350]  I had a little bit in the lab. Listen, we're still prototyping. There's still some things in the lab that are yet to come out.
[05:14.350 --> 05:23.650]  But last time we talked, Geoff, you brought up a great innovation. You brought up a possible change in the way we view the world, and I was inspired.
[05:24.190 --> 05:30.630]  I was inspired, and I wanted to see your vision. I wanted to really get into the mind of what you're doing, so I made a prototype.
[05:31.310 --> 05:31.510]  Okay.
[05:31.690 --> 05:39.470]  This is the first prototype. As you can see... Oh, whoops. I accidentally... We canceled that out. Oh, no, still went live. That was a different thing.
[05:39.470 --> 05:45.410]  Wait. What the fuck is going on?
[05:45.950 --> 05:59.490]  That was an accident. That was a really stupid guitar I saw that I clipped. I wish I could claim I prototyped the ballsack guitar. That was just in my camera roll, and I fat-thumbed it.
[05:59.910 --> 06:06.110]  The real prototype... I tried to cancel it out before it went through, but it made it...
[06:08.950 --> 06:12.430]  That is the fork prototype. I will take any question.
[06:12.910 --> 06:16.630]  Yeah, first question, what's up with the ballsack guitar?
[06:17.090 --> 06:23.110]  Andrew, I gotta say, I don't have any questions about the fork, but what's up with $3,500 seems a little...
[06:23.110 --> 06:23.310]  It's a lot, right?
[06:23.310 --> 06:24.250]  Well, that's because it's beautiful.
[06:24.830 --> 06:34.570]  It is beautiful. It's a unique instrument. I think I saw that in a local subreddit, and I thought it was absurd, so I clipped it. I screenshotted it to send to...
[06:34.570 --> 06:35.450]  Is this still for sale?
[06:35.450 --> 06:44.290]  I don't know. I didn't look at anything past the image of it, but that's a beautiful ballsack guitar made of fern wood, I believe.
[06:44.470 --> 06:46.670]  It's got Jay Turser pickups and hardware.
[06:47.130 --> 06:47.650]  Yeah.
[06:47.910 --> 06:48.370]  Dang.
[06:49.050 --> 06:52.230]  If only Nick said it could go in the museum. It'd be great for the museum.
[06:52.530 --> 06:56.730]  But I made your prototype. I made your fork prototype.
[06:57.150 --> 07:00.910]  How did you affix that tine to the side of the fork?
[07:01.830 --> 07:05.310]  By burning my fingers. These were plastic forks.
[07:05.530 --> 07:07.210]  Did you, like, weld it on?
[07:07.690 --> 07:13.190]  Yeah, so I had a barbecue lighter, and I burnt the base of it. I broke off the ends.
[07:13.350 --> 07:13.790]  Okay.
[07:13.870 --> 07:21.250]  Then I burnt the base, and then I would press against the back of the thing, and I... yeah, I burnt my fingers on every one.
[07:21.390 --> 07:27.830]  This isn't the only one I made. This was... I made this, and I realized, wait, there's room for more innovation here. We could expand further.
[07:27.830 --> 07:38.950]  What if... what if you want to give a little thumbs up while you're chowing down? You want a little thumbs up fork just to show to the people that, hey, I'm having a good day.
[07:39.110 --> 07:39.990]  How's that different to the other one?
[07:40.070 --> 07:41.770]  Because he broke the ends off.
[07:41.770 --> 07:43.610]  The ends. It's like a little fist.
[07:43.690 --> 07:43.930]  Knuckled up.
[07:44.350 --> 07:56.110]  Yeah, it's knuckled up. You got a little knuckled up thumbs up. I thought, maybe, maybe you're having, like, a chill vibes day. So I have the surf's up model. You want that.
[07:56.110 --> 07:58.730]  Do you give that one a little twist when the spaghetti's on?
[07:59.410 --> 08:04.410]  Uh, yeah, I think you'd have to have a little bit of wrist action in that one for the spaghetti to work.
[08:05.090 --> 08:10.310]  Um, maybe you're having a really bad day. This is the F-U irk we have.
[08:11.110 --> 08:13.710]  Uh, do you want to insult those around you?
[08:14.570 --> 08:19.990]  So, these are all, you know, these forks are all, the things are broken except the middle finger and the thumb on the side.
[08:21.050 --> 08:24.250]  You make the thumb stick out so, like, 90 degrees.
[08:24.730 --> 08:30.730]  Yeah, well, here's the problem, Gavin. I'm burning my fingers every time I'm applying one of those. It's not easy.
[08:31.490 --> 08:38.070]  So, I just, you know, we have a full, I think we have a full collection we could possibly sell. We've got a lot of potential that we could work with.
[08:38.570 --> 08:40.870]  Oh, you got the finger, somebody made a finger gun?
[08:41.270 --> 08:45.690]  Yeah, a little finger gun one, just, you know, want some action in your life.
[08:45.910 --> 08:47.850]  That's the F-U face five fork collection?
[08:48.270 --> 08:49.730]  Yeah, it's the face five fork, yeah.
[08:50.030 --> 08:51.970]  The F-U face five fork collection.
[08:52.870 --> 08:54.310]  Everyone needs five forks.
[08:54.310 --> 08:57.110]  Andrew, that's the greatest thing I've ever seen in my entire life, man.
[08:57.710 --> 09:08.890]  You absolutely took, you took my idea and you improved upon it by giving the thumbs personalities and turning it into, like, gestures.
[09:09.270 --> 09:13.130]  It adds a whole new level of usability to cutlery.
[09:13.270 --> 09:15.750]  Yeah, well, you need a range of emotions, I feel.
[09:15.990 --> 09:17.030]  Have you tried eating with any of them?
[09:17.030 --> 09:26.790]  Well, here's the problem. I don't know if melting plastic and reapplying it then releases harmful chemicals, that wouldn't be inedible to eat, so I'm scared to use any of them.
[09:27.230 --> 09:28.890]  But they are visual prototypes.
[09:29.610 --> 09:31.650]  I mean, I'm sure you inhaled way more than you would eat.
[09:31.910 --> 09:32.530]  That's possible.
[09:32.730 --> 09:33.130]  Eric.
[09:33.510 --> 09:33.690]  What?
[09:34.530 --> 09:35.450]  Can we get these made?
[09:36.830 --> 09:37.230]  No.
[09:38.230 --> 09:39.570]  Can we check with somebody?
[09:39.570 --> 09:40.910]  Why would we get these made?
[09:41.230 --> 09:44.390]  You don't want the F-U face five fork collection where only one fork is usable for?
[09:44.510 --> 09:44.650]  No.
[09:44.650 --> 09:44.910]  What do you mean?
[09:44.910 --> 09:45.330]  No.
[09:45.590 --> 09:47.490]  No, I don't want any of these forks.
[09:47.590 --> 09:49.250]  And I don't think any of them should exist.
[09:49.990 --> 09:50.790]  Well, they do.
[09:51.630 --> 09:51.910]  Yeah.
[09:52.130 --> 09:52.650]  And they're great.
[09:52.870 --> 09:53.310]  They do.
[09:53.510 --> 09:55.770]  And it should just be held to these five.
[09:56.010 --> 09:57.530]  These affronts to God.
[09:57.950 --> 09:58.970]  None of these are good.
[09:59.110 --> 10:00.150]  None of these are forks.
[10:00.390 --> 10:01.610]  Oh, they're all forks.
[10:01.950 --> 10:03.350]  Two of them are spoons.
[10:04.110 --> 10:06.410]  Two of them are closer to spoons than forks.
[10:06.610 --> 10:09.750]  As you're talking, I'm envisioning a certain fork.
[10:09.870 --> 10:12.570]  Can you guess which fork is in my mind right now?
[10:12.570 --> 10:14.690]  Is it the hang loose fork?
[10:15.430 --> 10:15.990]  Close.
[10:16.270 --> 10:16.830]  Close.
[10:17.170 --> 10:18.150]  It's not hang loose.
[10:18.690 --> 10:19.810]  One to the right.
[10:22.430 --> 10:25.810]  I will send this to Tony and see if we can...
[10:25.810 --> 10:26.370]  I don't...
[10:26.370 --> 10:32.070]  Again, Andrew has just broken plastic and glued plastic back together.
[10:32.550 --> 10:33.110]  Melted.
[10:33.590 --> 10:34.530]  Melted plastic.
[10:34.830 --> 10:36.770]  Why would you melt plastic and not glue it?
[10:36.930 --> 10:39.310]  Because I don't have glue, but I do have a barbecue lighter.
[10:41.630 --> 10:45.730]  So what you were doing was you were being creative with the tools at hand, which is...
[10:45.730 --> 10:46.990]  I was, yeah. I was making it work.
[10:47.130 --> 10:48.710]  Even more impressive to me.
[10:49.150 --> 10:51.470]  And would the goal be to make these out of metal?
[10:51.970 --> 10:54.570]  Well, I would say if we do the plastic route, they are not stable.
[10:54.890 --> 10:58.550]  I had to reapply many of these over time.
[10:58.830 --> 11:00.130]  They are fragile items.
[11:00.530 --> 11:05.890]  I love the idea of these just being sat in the corner of everyone's cutlery drawer, everyone's silverware drawer.
[11:05.890 --> 11:11.050]  And then, you know, there's that day where just nothing's clean and everything's about to go in the dishwasher.
[11:11.330 --> 11:13.770]  Which one do you go for out of those remaining?
[11:14.370 --> 11:15.770]  Say the fourth one is gone.
[11:16.050 --> 11:20.810]  Okay. Realistically, I think the thumbs up for me is number one.
[11:21.010 --> 11:22.750]  I think I'm going thumbs up.
[11:22.950 --> 11:24.230]  Yeah, it's the most, like, level.
[11:24.630 --> 11:32.170]  I would be afraid that the flipping the bird one, you would spear the inside of your throat without meaning to.
[11:32.250 --> 11:32.510]  Yeah.
[11:32.630 --> 11:33.070]  Oh, yeah.
[11:33.970 --> 11:36.230]  I feel like you should be with the finger guns, too.
[11:36.510 --> 11:41.490]  But I feel like you would only use the finger gun fork for, like, to skewer olives or something.
[11:42.050 --> 11:43.370]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[11:43.750 --> 11:44.450]  Yeah, corn on the cob.
[11:44.910 --> 11:45.810]  Oh, that's great.
[11:47.170 --> 11:56.270]  Yeah, I think the middle tying one is when all your food is halfway down the fork, that's where you're going to be putting into it.
[11:56.330 --> 11:57.970]  And you're going to get a uvula full of the other one.
[12:00.210 --> 12:09.810]  But maybe, like, if you put the F-U fork, the furk, in a pie, you could spear some fruit and then just get some crust on the other bit.
[12:11.350 --> 12:12.510]  You could go deep into something.
[12:14.010 --> 12:15.670]  Fork-U? I like that.
[12:15.810 --> 12:16.050]  Thank you.
[12:16.070 --> 12:17.530]  That's better. It's a better name.
[12:18.530 --> 12:21.050]  See, that's why you're the head of Unifarm, and I'm just, I'm in the lab.
[12:21.770 --> 12:24.850]  That is good time spent in the lab, I think. I think you've done us proud there.
[12:24.850 --> 12:32.290]  Andrew, thank you for clocking in to the lab over the last two weeks. Your efforts have not gone unappreciated.
[12:32.870 --> 12:39.390]  Honestly, the toughest part was finding plastic cutlery. It was difficult. It was surprisingly hard to find plastic forks.
[12:40.230 --> 12:42.230]  Do you have stores in Canada?
[12:42.730 --> 12:49.450]  We do, but, like, everything is now, like, paper or, like, wood. Tons of stores, we just, there's no plastic.
[12:49.770 --> 12:53.950]  I let you look all the way, all over for those plastic ones and didn't just look for glue.
[12:55.210 --> 12:56.930]  I never even considered glue.
[12:56.950 --> 12:58.970]  Because then you could have used wood, and it would have been pretty.
[12:59.310 --> 13:02.590]  Well, but I didn't want, I wanted a look. I wanted a certain look.
[13:03.050 --> 13:04.870]  Well, you could have still used glue.
[13:05.610 --> 13:11.070]  I could have still used glue, but I was married to the idea of how I was going to do this. I never even considered glue.
[13:11.070 --> 13:15.530]  Clearly, and what poetry you've created, Andrew. Really gorgeous stuff.
[13:15.970 --> 13:24.190]  Andrew, let me just say, small men tear down the methods and the ideas of great and creative men. Just remember that.
[13:24.970 --> 13:32.610]  That's true. I will agree with that. So, anytime you want to show me any of the things Geoff might be talking about, go ahead.
[13:32.850 --> 13:35.790]  Because I'm looking at five forks that are broken.
[13:37.510 --> 13:41.010]  Not broken, modified, Eric. Modified.
[13:41.570 --> 13:43.750]  Eric, in the... Re-contextualized.
[13:44.230 --> 13:49.030]  In the merch Slack, Eric wrote, hey, we want to make this, I don't know what that means.
[13:49.610 --> 13:52.890]  Talk to Geoff Ramsey, Andrew Penn, and Gavin Freer about it.
[13:54.130 --> 13:56.370]  Well, he's certainly passed it on.
[13:56.510 --> 14:01.110]  Absolutely. It's not... The other ones I'll answer for. This one is like, I don't even know...
[14:05.030 --> 14:07.030]  I don't even know what this is.
[14:07.510 --> 14:08.550]  They're forks.
[14:09.230 --> 14:14.050]  It's a continuation of our kitchenware range. We've got magnets, we've got bread clips.
[14:14.670 --> 14:16.010]  They're forks-pressions.
[14:17.170 --> 14:18.870]  Forks-pressions is good, too.
[14:19.250 --> 14:21.110]  Geoff, you're coming up with good buzzwords today.
[14:21.230 --> 14:21.750]  Thanks, man.
[14:22.330 --> 14:24.410]  That's great. Forks-pressions.
[14:24.650 --> 14:27.270]  Express yourself through food. Think about it.
[14:30.030 --> 14:35.770]  Yeah, and let's focus in on forks, because I don't know what the version of this would be.
[14:36.250 --> 14:37.270]  Knives or spoons.
[14:37.290 --> 14:39.210]  Well, that's the thing. It's like...
[14:39.590 --> 14:47.950]  It all boils down to the idea that we essentially made a fork 300 years ago and then stopped all R&D that day.
[14:47.950 --> 14:49.690]  They're like, good enough, move it on.
[14:50.050 --> 14:56.730]  And it's time. We need to go back and take a look at these things and say, no, maybe one pass wasn't enough.
[14:57.030 --> 15:00.170]  Maybe there should have been a second and a third and a fourth pass on the fork.
[15:00.490 --> 15:01.950]  Yeah, no one ever patched the fork.
[15:03.070 --> 15:07.450]  I don't know if this will make sense to anyone else, but I don't want to be a knife guy.
[15:08.010 --> 15:12.290]  In my head, when I think of knife guy, that's not... I don't like that. I don't like that feel.
[15:12.330 --> 15:13.690]  But I like being a fork guy.
[15:14.250 --> 15:15.810]  There's something good about a fork guy.
[15:16.510 --> 15:18.970]  It's better than a knife guy or a spoon guy.
[15:19.290 --> 15:21.310]  I'd say it's infinitely more useless than a knife.
[15:21.710 --> 15:25.250]  Yeah, I don't know. It's just the knife guy to me is overly aggressive.
[15:25.470 --> 15:28.950]  The spoon guy to me is weird. There's something normal about the fork guy.
[15:29.350 --> 15:30.650]  The fork guy feels like a good middle.
[15:31.210 --> 15:35.290]  Fork guy is kind of like the best of all worlds.
[15:35.610 --> 15:37.190]  He kind of like straddles in between.
[15:37.750 --> 15:40.250]  Yeah, it's an everyman piece of color.
[15:40.750 --> 15:43.230]  Fork guy is an everyman. Yeah, there you go.
[15:43.230 --> 15:46.990]  Fork is an everyman tool, for sure.
[15:47.770 --> 15:49.210]  How was the museum?
[15:52.860 --> 15:53.180]  Sweet.
[15:53.700 --> 15:56.280]  Oh, sorry, I didn't know.
[15:56.500 --> 15:58.820]  Wait, did you blank on museum?
[15:59.200 --> 16:00.760]  I didn't know what he was talking about for a second.
[16:00.880 --> 16:02.280]  You're the leader of the museum.
[16:02.480 --> 16:06.240]  We've been talking about the goddamn face museum for six months.
[16:06.620 --> 16:10.540]  Well, not today. We haven't. That was two weeks ago.
[16:10.760 --> 16:11.860]  We haven't spoken in two weeks.
[16:12.860 --> 16:13.700]  It was great.
[16:14.680 --> 16:16.540]  I enjoyed it. How did you like it, Eric?
[16:16.780 --> 16:23.080]  It was great. It was really cool to see all of the stuff that you never thought would be collected in one place in one place.
[16:23.680 --> 16:26.820]  Seeing the porta potty as a main feature, like everything.
[16:27.140 --> 16:28.660]  It was really, really cool.
[16:28.820 --> 16:30.840]  RTX altogether was a lot of fun.
[16:31.400 --> 16:37.900]  And we got to do the Break Show, which was probably the biggest face representation there.
[16:37.900 --> 16:46.160]  And we got to announce that come the beginning of August, which will be two weeks from when this comes out,
[16:46.600 --> 16:50.940]  the Break Show will be a live weekly show, a one-hour show with myself, Geoff, and Emily.
[16:51.460 --> 16:52.160]  Very exciting.
[16:52.620 --> 16:54.400]  Yeah, really excited to get going on that.
[16:54.620 --> 16:56.960]  The other three of you, if and when you ever want to come.
[16:57.120 --> 16:57.500]  Yeah, yeah.
[16:58.200 --> 17:01.380]  Truly, this isn't to box you out.
[17:01.460 --> 17:02.900]  It's to keep your schedules loose.
[17:02.900 --> 17:14.140]  And then if you have a Monday where you have an availability, I would love for you guys to be on while we open cards that look like stepdads or guys who look like they are swatting and pooping.
[17:14.240 --> 17:14.760]  You know what I mean?
[17:14.860 --> 17:16.220]  Yeah, it's that kind of stuff.
[17:16.820 --> 17:24.380]  Are you saying after 11 years of me doing a live weekly show on a Monday, I finally stopped doing it?
[17:24.560 --> 17:26.900]  Hey, check out this Monday live stream.
[17:27.160 --> 17:31.360]  Well, there's definitely a reason why there was an opening live on Monday.
[17:33.300 --> 17:36.100]  Why it was the easiest day to go, look at that big old gap.
[17:39.100 --> 17:46.840]  One thing we did that was cool was Eric passed around a sack pack ahead of time to the line, and people just threw in packs of stuff.
[17:46.980 --> 17:49.680]  And then so we only opened cards that the audience brought.
[17:50.180 --> 17:50.720]  Oh, that rules.
[17:51.400 --> 17:53.080]  Yeah, we didn't get through half of them, probably.
[17:53.400 --> 17:54.000]  Oh, wow.
[17:54.000 --> 18:12.960]  There was also a fan meetup, and I have something that I can present to you guys, which is the summer of 98 yearbook that has been put together by the community that I have here in my office that I can bring in and all that stuff.
[18:13.300 --> 18:16.020]  It is really cool. It is a full on yearbook.
[18:16.020 --> 18:22.660]  You can get looks at, we'll post pictures later, but if you guys want to look at it there, you can.
[18:23.140 --> 18:38.120]  Pictures of community members, what they look like in the summer of 98, what they were doing, a little, you know, a quote or a song lyric that they really liked.
[18:38.360 --> 18:39.740]  So I have this.
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.340]  You have a book of kids on your desk?
[18:42.340 --> 18:44.740]  It is in my office.
[18:47.020 --> 18:48.820]  It's summer of 98 stuff.
[18:49.020 --> 18:57.000]  And then if you keep going, it's signed by a bunch of our community members who brought stuff, got pictures and everything like that.
[18:57.140 --> 18:58.720]  It was such a cool turnout.
[18:58.900 --> 18:59.820]  It was such a cool thing.
[18:59.940 --> 19:02.200]  It'll definitely be something that we cherish and hang on to.
[19:03.300 --> 19:03.720]  Fantastic.
[19:04.680 --> 19:07.980]  In addition to that, a lot of people gave us a lot of really cool stuff over the weekend.
[19:08.360 --> 19:16.000]  Not the least of which were the non-regulation Gerplers that a couple of people gave us.
[19:16.140 --> 19:18.260]  And they gave me one for each of you.
[19:18.400 --> 19:20.700]  So there's a Gavin one and an Andrew one as well.
[19:20.720 --> 19:20.980]  So cool.
[19:21.140 --> 19:22.260]  And they're adorable.
[19:22.520 --> 19:23.280]  They're Gorplers.
[19:24.200 --> 19:24.620]  Gorplers.
[19:25.280 --> 19:25.700]  Grumplers.
[19:26.660 --> 19:27.080]  Grumplers.
[19:27.380 --> 19:27.800]  Grunchlers.
[19:27.800 --> 19:28.520]  Gogo Nowlers.
[19:28.780 --> 19:30.220]  Yeah, they're all very funny.
[19:30.860 --> 19:31.320]  It's great.
[19:31.320 --> 19:34.260]  And some of them, instead of face, it says face-face.
[19:37.440 --> 19:40.540]  In the yearbook, someone is just non-existent.
[19:42.520 --> 19:46.560]  Man, I was bummed I had to miss that meetup.
[19:47.100 --> 19:53.660]  Unfortunately, it was the exact same time I had to do a bit in the Shady Rays booth.
[19:54.920 --> 20:01.260]  Shady Rays, they were like the sponsor of the F*** Face Museum, which was very, very kind of them.
[20:01.380 --> 20:06.580]  So I had to go over and thank them for spending money on a podcast called F*** Face.
[20:06.940 --> 20:07.340]  It's rare.
[20:07.880 --> 20:08.400]  It's rare.
[20:09.420 --> 20:14.400]  So what did people say about the museum? Was it like a nice attraction or was it just a bunch of shit that no one cared about?
[20:14.700 --> 20:16.420]  No, no, no. People were into it.
[20:17.000 --> 20:17.820]  They got shirts.
[20:18.020 --> 20:18.880]  Me and Geoff were there.
[20:18.960 --> 20:19.600]  We were signing stuff.
[20:19.600 --> 20:27.240]  Actually, me and Geoff, after one of our live things, we went over and recorded two episodes of Anima, supplemental Anima content.
[20:27.460 --> 20:31.020]  One will be out by now and one won't be out for another eight weeks.
[20:32.200 --> 20:35.220]  You gotta wait for Gus to take another two weeks off.
[20:35.580 --> 20:38.580]  Yeah, we wanted to record eight weeks in advance just for the fun of it.
[20:39.360 --> 20:42.240]  I sent you guys a link of all the fake Gerplers.
[20:42.620 --> 20:44.540]  They're so good.
[20:45.380 --> 20:49.420]  There's one that just says The Grink and I'm really a big fan of it.
[20:52.980 --> 20:54.720]  The Gobbler, the Glubbler.
[20:55.400 --> 20:56.200]  The Glunper.
[20:56.800 --> 20:59.240]  Yeah, Go Now Flukeface. Great.
[20:59.800 --> 21:08.780]  We've met a million awesome people. I actually signed a couple of pre-hit balls, like solidly hit balls too.
[21:09.660 --> 21:11.420]  You don't see those often anymore.
[21:12.000 --> 21:13.000]  Signed a couple of vinyls.
[21:13.500 --> 21:14.620]  Yeah, signed a bunch of vinyl.
[21:15.140 --> 21:18.200]  Were the balls the ones that we sent out and they've come back to you?
[21:18.200 --> 21:18.520]  Yeah.
[21:18.660 --> 21:19.680]  Oh, that's so cool.
[21:19.860 --> 21:20.440]  That's wicked.
[21:20.740 --> 21:29.480]  It's really crazy having stuff that I was beaten down for for so long come back to us and people are like, I love that I got this.
[21:29.520 --> 21:32.660]  And I went, that's the other side that I don't get to see.
[21:33.420 --> 21:35.120]  People who are stoked about it.
[21:35.600 --> 21:40.720]  That vinyl, when people would pull the vinyl out for signatures, people would get tense around them.
[21:40.800 --> 21:43.220]  They'd be like, is that the fucking vinyl? Did you have the vinyl? Did you travel?
[21:43.480 --> 21:47.620]  They'd be like, did you travel? You traveled on a plane with the vinyl? Are you crazy?
[21:49.320 --> 21:50.220]  It is weird.
[21:50.300 --> 21:53.560]  Like when that pulls out, it's like a whole different level of reverence for some reason.
[21:53.820 --> 21:54.720]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[21:54.860 --> 21:55.740]  It was a lot of RTX.
[21:55.880 --> 21:56.380]  It's a blast.
[21:56.740 --> 21:57.260]  It's annoying.
[21:57.460 --> 21:58.320]  It always is.
[21:58.440 --> 22:01.180]  And as stressful as it is to do all these limited runs, it's so cool.
[22:01.240 --> 22:04.800]  And you see them in people's hands, especially when they come back to you like that.
[22:05.140 --> 22:08.780]  And now we have the we have the bloody golden GURPS out there.
[22:08.820 --> 22:09.880]  We've we had our leak.
[22:10.240 --> 22:10.980]  Oh, yeah.
[22:11.080 --> 22:11.980]  Yeah, we had our leak.
[22:12.360 --> 22:13.700]  Golden GURP winner number five.
[22:14.080 --> 22:17.380]  Golden GURP winner number five leaked it to the world.
[22:18.200 --> 22:18.920]  No hesitation.
[22:19.020 --> 22:19.620]  I will.
[22:19.780 --> 22:19.960]  Yeah.
[22:20.080 --> 22:21.560]  I hope you're happy with yourself.
[22:21.660 --> 22:22.280]  Number five.
[22:22.580 --> 22:23.540]  Hope you're happy.
[22:24.740 --> 22:29.440]  It's so funny that it's there's just a YouTube video that we didn't put out, but it's the only place to see that.
[22:29.760 --> 22:30.480]  I love it.
[22:31.340 --> 22:32.040]  I think it's great.
[22:32.120 --> 22:32.500]  I love it.
[22:32.600 --> 22:33.500]  It's like we don't own it.
[22:33.600 --> 22:34.240]  It's not our video.
[22:34.360 --> 22:35.920]  We gave it to number five.
[22:36.000 --> 22:36.960]  Number five posted it.
[22:37.440 --> 22:38.920]  Send all the views to number five.
[22:39.340 --> 22:43.880]  Yeah, you can upload stuff that, you know, you can upload stuff to claim it when other people upload it.
[22:43.900 --> 22:44.780]  And we didn't even do that.
[22:45.000 --> 22:45.220]  No.
[22:45.360 --> 22:45.720]  Fuck no.
[22:46.440 --> 22:49.280]  That was the whole point of this stupid thing was that it's your video.
[22:49.400 --> 22:50.500]  Do whatever you want to with it.
[22:50.660 --> 22:53.200]  I also am happy people liked it.
[22:53.240 --> 22:54.560]  Like people seemed to enjoy the video.
[22:55.100 --> 22:55.580]  That's great.
[22:56.080 --> 22:57.800]  27,000 views on that video.
[22:59.100 --> 23:02.480]  That's more than our episodes get on our YouTube channel.
[23:02.540 --> 23:03.320]  So it did really well.
[23:04.160 --> 23:05.360]  We get nothing for it.
[23:06.880 --> 23:15.420]  I will say that something that we thought about later, we kept going, yeah, when you get it, we're going to know you leaked it because it's GURP winner number five.
[23:15.420 --> 23:19.080]  And then I went, how do we know who GURP winner number five is?
[23:19.080 --> 23:20.060]  Yeah, we don't.
[23:20.820 --> 23:24.080]  I told you I wanted to put their names on.
[23:24.220 --> 23:27.520]  I'm looking at the order and you said no, because that'll take forever.
[23:28.500 --> 23:30.440]  Wait, you wanted to put their names on what?
[23:31.080 --> 23:32.360]  On the watermark.
[23:32.760 --> 23:33.620]  Yeah, on the watermark.
[23:33.940 --> 23:37.480]  So you wanted to choose who it goes to?
[23:37.960 --> 23:38.280]  No.
[23:38.440 --> 23:38.640]  No.
[23:38.640 --> 23:46.460]  I wanted the warehouse to send them all out and record the names of everyone who got a gold one.
[23:46.980 --> 23:48.940]  Send them back to us and then I'd put them on.
[23:49.260 --> 23:50.140]  I understand.
[23:50.580 --> 23:51.920]  Now I understand what you're saying.
[23:52.340 --> 23:53.180]  Now it's crazy though.
[23:53.660 --> 23:55.380]  Yeah, I 100% agree.
[23:55.560 --> 23:56.640]  Do you trust them?
[23:57.900 --> 23:59.140]  Do you trust them to do that?
[23:59.560 --> 24:00.060]  God, no.
[24:01.900 --> 24:03.600]  I wouldn't trust them with anything.
[24:05.100 --> 24:06.220]  All right.
[24:09.860 --> 24:11.560]  Why? That's not on our merch team.
[24:11.800 --> 24:12.900]  That's not our team.
[24:13.960 --> 24:14.840]  That's a warehouse.
[24:15.380 --> 24:15.860]  That's true.
[24:16.880 --> 24:21.560]  Yeah, I can't imagine trying to explain to a warehouse.
[24:21.780 --> 24:27.500]  Okay, so we want you to pick where these, like, fulfill these orders, but then don't send them to the people.
[24:28.000 --> 24:29.480]  Send them somewhere else completely.
[24:29.720 --> 24:31.400]  Then we'll send them back to you.
[24:31.440 --> 24:32.020]  Don't worry about it.
[24:32.020 --> 24:33.040]  We promise it'll happen.
[24:33.300 --> 24:35.860]  And then you send it then.
[24:35.860 --> 24:39.980]  Yeah, or unless you, like, RNG all the orders before we send it all to the warehouse.
[24:40.300 --> 24:43.820]  As someone who worked in a warehouse, I would hate you if I got that request.
[24:44.080 --> 24:45.620]  That is an insane request.
[24:46.320 --> 24:52.060]  Anytime we have to interact with what we're selling, which is a lot on this show, it's an absolute nightmare.
[24:52.440 --> 24:53.720]  It's a pain for everyone involved.
[24:55.160 --> 24:55.440]  Yeah.
[24:57.100 --> 25:00.200]  Yeah, that is funny though, the idea that the warehouse now suffers as well.
[25:00.900 --> 25:02.180]  In a completely unique way.
[25:02.520 --> 25:03.760]  Just people who don't even know what this is.
[25:04.080 --> 25:04.760]  Yeah.
[25:05.580 --> 25:07.660]  Can I walk us back just a hair?
[25:07.840 --> 25:10.260]  We were talking about the Summer of 98 yearbook.
[25:10.980 --> 25:11.140]  Yeah.
[25:12.300 --> 25:16.680]  Andrew, before we were starting, was telling me that you, Andrew, you're deep in the Summer of 98 right now.
[25:16.700 --> 25:17.580]  I'm deep in the Summer of 98.
[25:17.800 --> 25:23.060]  Yeah, I had a content idea for what that supplemental could be that I wanted to run by you guys.
[25:23.120 --> 25:30.140]  When I think about, like, what the summer means to me, it's like there's the song of the summer and there's, like, the movie of the summer.
[25:30.340 --> 25:32.420]  Or, like, two of the staples of the summer.
[25:32.420 --> 25:38.440]  So I've been exclusively watching movies from the Summer of 98 for, like, the past two weeks.
[25:38.940 --> 25:45.760]  And my idea is I will publish a list of, like, all of the films that release widely in the Summer of 98.
[25:46.080 --> 25:51.140]  And then we'll all pick three of them and then we'll have a discussion amongst all of us.
[25:51.200 --> 25:54.060]  We'll eliminate five of those films so then we end up with a top ten.
[25:54.500 --> 26:00.020]  And then we will rank as a collective what the top ten films of the Summer of 98 are.
[26:00.520 --> 26:01.980]  And I also did that for music.
[26:01.980 --> 26:08.020]  I looked at the top 100 and wrote down a list of all the songs that charted and released during the Summer of 98.
[26:08.400 --> 26:11.220]  And what are the boundaries? What's the border of the summer, technically?
[26:11.280 --> 26:16.300]  It's June. It's the first of June till the end of August. So, like, September 1st.
[26:16.380 --> 26:21.300]  I've been going hard on songs. Just been putting on Summer of 98 playlists and it's a real throwback.
[26:21.640 --> 26:25.760]  I haven't really thought about movies. What came out? Was it, like, did Godzilla come out?
[26:25.760 --> 26:36.080]  No, that didn't. But the song for Godzilla did release within the window. The six minute Puff Daddy track. I don't remember what it's called.
[26:36.440 --> 26:42.880]  There's some great licensed music, or not even licensed music, but, like, song music or movie music.
[26:43.180 --> 26:45.120]  I thought Jamiroquai had Godzilla.
[26:47.040 --> 26:49.680]  No, I think it's a Puff Daddy song.
[26:49.680 --> 26:55.060]  It was Puff Daddy and it was, what was it, Come With Me? And it's just the riff from Cashmere?
[26:55.280 --> 26:56.980]  Yes. Do you remember that?
[26:56.980 --> 27:00.220]  Yes, it is. And it's like six minutes long for some reason.
[27:00.300 --> 27:00.920]  It's so long.
[27:01.180 --> 27:04.800]  Jimmy Page also is credited on it. You're right. You're reminding me of that now.
[27:04.960 --> 27:06.860]  Yeah, because it's just the riff. It's great.
[27:07.020 --> 27:14.160]  My favorite of the movie songs is Woof Woof by the 69 Boys for the Doctor Dolittle movie.
[27:14.160 --> 27:21.400]  That's a great discovery I made. It's a long list. It's probably like 70 songs and like 40 or 50 movies.
[27:21.600 --> 27:24.180]  Hey, Gav, do you know a movie came out in the summer of 98?
[27:24.960 --> 27:25.700]  What's that?
[27:25.820 --> 27:27.440]  Oh, Dirty Work.
[27:29.360 --> 27:30.660]  I'm going to go lift weights.
[27:31.560 --> 27:32.000]  What?
[27:33.880 --> 27:39.680]  I was texting with Gavin before. The Avengers, the 98 Avengers came out in the summer of 98.
[27:39.860 --> 27:42.460]  I think it's the worst movie of the summer of 98.
[27:42.460 --> 27:45.020]  The Avengers, like the TV show remake?
[27:45.580 --> 27:50.700]  The TV show remake, yes, with Sean Connery and Ray Fiennes and Uma Thurman.
[27:50.940 --> 27:51.560]  I never saw it.
[27:51.820 --> 27:57.920]  John Steed and Emma Peel. Yeah, I remember watching that when it came out, having never seen the original TV show.
[27:58.060 --> 28:02.100]  But I remember that film being just dog shit. Awful.
[28:02.460 --> 28:06.600]  It's just, it's like, it's the worst British charm I've ever seen.
[28:06.980 --> 28:11.900]  Like they're trying to be charming constantly, but none of it is charming. It's just annoying.
[28:11.900 --> 28:15.760]  None of it makes sense. It's a movie about the weather, ultimately.
[28:16.120 --> 28:18.760]  It sucks. It really sucks.
[28:19.200 --> 28:27.120]  There's a scene, you know how like in, in like spy movies, there's sometimes the, the board of villains and like they're wearing a disguise or whatever.
[28:27.340 --> 28:29.920]  So like nobody knows the identities of the people.
[28:30.080 --> 28:35.880]  They do that in this movie, but they put everybody in a giant fucking bear mascot outfit for no reason.
[28:36.220 --> 28:38.220]  There's no explanation for why that's the choice.
[28:38.220 --> 28:42.260]  They just all look like fucking beanie babies sitting at this table.
[28:42.680 --> 28:46.220]  And it makes no sense. It's ridiculous. Sean Connery's wearing one.
[28:46.280 --> 28:48.060]  It's so dumb. It's a terrible movie.
[28:48.080 --> 28:51.660]  For a split second there, I thought you were saying they were all in the same mascot outfit.
[28:51.900 --> 28:56.840]  And then I started imagining like, what if two bad guys met up in like one of those horse costumes?
[28:58.280 --> 28:59.780]  One at the front and one at the back.
[29:00.600 --> 29:06.540]  I like the idea of them like breaking off, you know, like how sometimes they'll separate and the characters have to choose who to follow.
[29:06.540 --> 29:09.960]  But they still don't know who each other are because they're in the horse.
[29:10.820 --> 29:17.820]  That's sort of the idea of like, he says, like, I know who you all are and you know who you are, but you can't know who each other are.
[29:18.180 --> 29:19.660]  Yeah, it's a dumb thing.
[29:21.340 --> 29:24.720]  So are we into this summer of 98 draft?
[29:24.980 --> 29:27.600]  I mean, draft is maybe a loose term because ranking.
[29:27.740 --> 29:27.920]  Yeah.
[29:29.520 --> 29:30.320]  Definitive list.
[29:30.880 --> 29:33.600]  So do we have to watch everything and listen to everything?
[29:33.960 --> 29:35.820]  No, you can. You can do whatever you want to do.
[29:35.820 --> 29:39.060]  I've just decided that I would like to watch all these movies.
[29:39.200 --> 29:40.140]  So I've been doing that.
[29:40.600 --> 29:43.640]  But there's a lot of mainstream movies that you've probably seen.
[29:43.740 --> 29:48.080]  Like, I probably had watched like 10 or 15 of these before I even started.
[29:48.300 --> 29:50.440]  Can you send us the list?
[29:50.940 --> 29:54.160]  Sure, I'll have to compile it in like a better way than I currently have.
[29:54.220 --> 29:56.040]  But yeah, I'll do that in the Slack as soon as we're done.
[29:56.260 --> 29:58.780]  No worries, that way we can just all be operating off the same.
[29:59.040 --> 29:59.720]  Yeah, absolutely.
[29:59.880 --> 30:02.900]  Yeah, I'll do that for the songs as well as the movies.
[30:02.900 --> 30:05.540]  So I figured like, as I said, we'd all pick like three.
[30:05.700 --> 30:06.720]  So we'd end up with 15.
[30:07.120 --> 30:10.200]  And then we will remove from there.
[30:10.500 --> 30:12.360]  And like, take it very seriously.
[30:12.500 --> 30:13.660]  Like, this is our list.
[30:13.880 --> 30:14.140]  Okay.
[30:14.500 --> 30:18.300]  Find out what the definitive song and movie of the Summer of 98 is.
[30:19.580 --> 30:21.320]  Some great movies in the Summer of 98.
[30:21.460 --> 30:22.700]  There's some real shit too.
[30:23.100 --> 30:26.480]  There's some fascinating, just like even culturally.
[30:26.660 --> 30:30.300]  I've seen Eric, like how Stella Got Her Groove Back is not a movie that would come out now.
[30:30.400 --> 30:32.460]  That is a terrible, weird film.
[30:33.460 --> 30:35.220]  Why is it a terrible film?
[30:35.740 --> 30:41.480]  It's like the whole premise of it is this 40-year-old dating a 20-year-old and that the 40-year-old is in the right.
[30:41.520 --> 30:42.300]  Oh, yeah.
[30:42.720 --> 30:45.720]  And the movie ends with them getting married.
[30:46.160 --> 30:47.920]  And like, it's just, it's not good.
[30:48.660 --> 30:50.180]  She did get her groove back though.
[30:50.620 --> 30:52.560]  I don't know if she did.
[30:52.740 --> 30:54.380]  And if she did, maybe she shouldn't have.
[30:55.080 --> 30:56.920]  Everybody deserves a groove, Andrew.
[30:56.920 --> 30:58.100]  I don't know.
[30:58.240 --> 31:03.180]  The way that, if that is how she got her groove back, there's maybe a discussion that could be had.
[31:03.420 --> 31:04.760]  I mean, have you ever lost your groove?
[31:06.520 --> 31:07.000]  Definitely.
[31:07.420 --> 31:07.860]  Yeah, absolutely.
[31:08.020 --> 31:13.120]  I'd say anytime my ankles are below 40, I'd say I'm grooveless.
[31:13.540 --> 31:14.780]  Are you grooving right now?
[31:15.320 --> 31:16.440]  I'm grooving right now.
[31:16.520 --> 31:18.420]  Yeah, we got a pretty good groove going.
[31:18.860 --> 31:22.140]  Wow, that's the most confident I've heard you about your ankles in about a year.
[31:22.920 --> 31:24.280]  Oh, yeah, my ankles have been fine.
[31:24.380 --> 31:25.480]  My lungs are terrible.
[31:25.480 --> 31:28.060]  That's the COVID thing.
[31:28.360 --> 31:30.780]  Yeah, that's my new...
[31:30.780 --> 31:32.140]  Ankles were last year, okay?
[31:32.400 --> 31:34.020]  Summer 98 is all about bad lungs.
[31:42.560 --> 31:46.720]  Cold turkey may be great on sandwiches, but there's a better way to break your bad habits.
[31:46.840 --> 31:50.860]  And we're not talking about some weird stock tips from the internet type thing.
[31:51.020 --> 31:53.600]  We're talking about our sponsor, Fume.
[31:53.780 --> 31:55.940]  And they look at the problem in a different way.
[31:56.200 --> 31:58.180]  Not everything in a bad habit is wrong.
[31:58.180 --> 32:02.820]  So instead of a drastic, uncomfortable change, why not just remove the bad from your habit?

[34:50.620 --> 34:55.120]  And one of the best ways to keep your online browsing activity private is by using ExpressVPN.
[34:55.780 --> 35:04.320]  When you use ExpressVPN, your internet connection is rerouted through a secure encrypted server, so you can surf the web anonymously without looking over your shoulder.
[35:04.780 --> 35:10.600]  Look, I know you probably think all you have to do is use incognito mode and no one can see that you've watched every last hentai video on Pornhub.
[35:10.600 --> 35:11.600]  But you're wrong.
[35:12.020 --> 35:17.160]  Even when you use incognito mode, your internet provider like Verizon or AT&T can see every single website you visit.
[35:17.440 --> 35:21.080]  And you live on campus or use a shared Wi-Fi, your network admin can too.
[35:21.480 --> 35:22.620]  To be honest, that's kind of scary.
[35:22.960 --> 35:27.460]  That's why I use ExpressVPN whenever I go online, and I recommend all of you do the same.
[35:27.840 --> 35:33.940]  Without ExpressVPN, you're giving people a free license to peek over your shoulder and see all the freaky shit you're looking at.
[35:33.940 --> 35:38.160]  So protect your privacy today and get three months of ExpressVPN for free.
[35:38.340 --> 35:40.300]  Visit expressvpn.com slash face.

[35:47.420 --> 35:51.660]  Can I share one other thing that I realized that I'm really stupid?
[35:52.200 --> 35:56.380]  I realized I made a really dumb mistake, and it's nice that I caught it.
[35:57.140 --> 36:03.960]  Little Caesars introduced these pizza pop things.
[36:04.340 --> 36:07.620]  They were circular, and I ordered them a month ago.
[36:07.760 --> 36:08.400]  They were a new item.
[36:08.980 --> 36:10.760]  Wait, like a little pizza sphere?
[36:11.400 --> 36:18.320]  Yeah, like a little circular almost pizza bite, I'd say.
[36:18.860 --> 36:23.780]  I'll post a photo of what they look like in a minute, and you can see what I realized.
[36:23.780 --> 36:28.040]  So I ordered it, funny enough, literally a month ago was when I ordered this.
[36:28.740 --> 36:33.000]  And at the time, they didn't have photos of the product.
[36:33.540 --> 36:35.780]  It was just these were their puffs, they're called.
[36:36.680 --> 36:39.860]  I was feeling more the cheese and herb one.
[36:40.340 --> 36:46.060]  But I ordered the pepperoni crazy puffs because it comes with four as opposed to three.
[36:46.320 --> 36:48.080]  Which I thought was weird at the time.
[36:48.860 --> 36:49.900]  Oh, but it's three cheese.
[36:50.620 --> 36:51.640]  It's three cheese.
[36:51.640 --> 36:56.500]  I went to reorder them last week, and I realized my mistake.
[36:56.860 --> 37:00.840]  I thought that pepperoni crazy puffs.
[37:01.520 --> 37:04.740]  I went, oh, there's four of those, and they're $5.99.
[37:05.560 --> 37:07.920]  Or I could get three cheese ones.
[37:08.640 --> 37:10.680]  But it's the same price, and it doesn't...
[37:11.320 --> 37:16.540]  So I ordered pepperoni at the time when I wanted the cheese more.
[37:16.900 --> 37:20.180]  And then when I opened the app to reorder them last week,
[37:20.180 --> 37:22.740]  I realized I'm a fucking idiot.
[37:23.100 --> 37:26.520]  It's three cheese, but there's still four.
[37:26.680 --> 37:29.840]  Because it even says four hand-held pieces below three cheese.
[37:30.140 --> 37:32.340]  I was just so drawn into the three.
[37:32.600 --> 37:34.380]  I don't think that's so dumb, though.
[37:34.400 --> 37:38.800]  Because I feel like three cheese isn't as popular as four cheese when it comes to pizza.
[37:39.060 --> 37:40.880]  Really? I've never heard four cheese.
[37:41.200 --> 37:42.100]  You've never heard four cheese?
[37:42.580 --> 37:44.300]  No, it's always three cheese.
[37:44.540 --> 37:45.000]  Oh, is it?
[37:45.600 --> 37:45.860]  Yeah.
[37:46.380 --> 37:47.340]  I don't know what I'm on about.
[37:47.340 --> 37:50.600]  No, no, four cheese is a common thing.
[37:50.600 --> 37:51.300]  Yeah, it's a common thing.
[37:51.740 --> 37:51.860]  Really?
[37:52.960 --> 37:57.420]  I will say I can't see the number three without also seeing the number four right below it.
[37:57.580 --> 37:58.720]  They're next to each other.
[37:59.720 --> 38:05.820]  But I want to give Andrew credit because it does say the number three when it should be spelled out.
[38:05.840 --> 38:07.200]  True, true, true.
[38:07.840 --> 38:08.900]  Why should it be spelled out?
[38:10.680 --> 38:12.680]  It should be spelled out.
[38:12.680 --> 38:18.880]  It shouldn't say three cheese and then the number four right below it.
[38:18.940 --> 38:20.700]  It should be spelled out three cheese.
[38:21.000 --> 38:22.640]  The Red Baron doesn't spell it out.
[38:22.660 --> 38:23.360]  They do it incorrectly.
[38:23.880 --> 38:27.240]  According to AP Style Guide, any number under ten needs to be written out.
[38:28.160 --> 38:28.640]  Thank you.
[38:31.040 --> 38:33.500]  Never see numbers below ten.
[38:34.640 --> 38:38.100]  Not in journalism or in Red Baron pizzas.
[38:39.860 --> 38:41.520]  Which I qualify as journalism.
[38:41.520 --> 38:42.260]  Yes, I think.
[38:45.100 --> 38:46.940]  Gavin just wrote 24-7.
[38:47.340 --> 38:49.960]  Well, I mean, the seven's got to be read out.
[38:50.420 --> 38:55.620]  You think 24-7 is... it's written a lot in like the newspaper?
[38:56.000 --> 38:56.960]  In the newspaper?
[38:57.160 --> 38:57.320]  What?
[38:58.200 --> 39:01.120]  Which would be journalism, which is what we're talking about.
[39:01.500 --> 39:01.900]  Oh.
[39:06.220 --> 39:08.940]  I don't... that made me...
[39:08.940 --> 39:11.800]  What you just did to me made me dizzy.
[39:12.060 --> 39:14.740]  What's journalism about a door dash order?
[39:16.780 --> 39:19.880]  I'm just saying, I just think it should be like, look, it should be...
[39:19.880 --> 39:20.860]  He's saying there's a standard.
[39:21.720 --> 39:22.200]  Oh, yeah.
[39:22.700 --> 39:23.460]  Yeah, that's nice.
[39:24.280 --> 39:25.140]  That does look a lot better.
[39:25.140 --> 39:25.820]  That's a good looking pizza right there.
[39:25.880 --> 39:26.700]  And just the number four.
[39:26.880 --> 39:27.460]  Hey, I had...
[39:27.460 --> 39:28.040]  That does look like...
[39:28.040 --> 39:35.220]  If you guys don't mind indulging for a second, I had another idea for another business or product line that I was going to run by you guys.
[39:35.380 --> 39:35.540]  Okay.
[39:37.040 --> 39:41.680]  The other day I was... well, a couple weeks ago, I went on a vacation and I was out of town.
[39:42.660 --> 39:49.620]  And I was... I was at like one of those destinations where everybody buys a shirt that says where it is on it, you know?
[39:50.360 --> 39:54.060]  And as I was... I was just seeing all the people buying all the shirts for the place we were at.
[39:54.160 --> 40:00.560]  And then I saw... I saw... I noticed... I started paying attention to what shirts other people were also wearing.
[40:00.560 --> 40:06.400]  And they'd be like, oh, I... I summited Mount Kilimanjaro.
[40:06.820 --> 40:08.940]  And then there was a shirt that was like, I saw the Great Wall of China.
[40:09.220 --> 40:12.440]  And then I... I don't know. I saw a shirt for like some place in Italy.
[40:12.680 --> 40:20.520]  And I got to thinking, it's way easier to just buy a shirt from a place than to actually go to the place.
[40:20.760 --> 40:28.000]  So what if we just started a business where we sold like souvenir shirts so that you don't have to go to the place?
[40:28.000 --> 40:33.940]  Like what if I just sold a I saw the Great Wall of... I personally went to the Great Wall of China and touched it t-shirt.
[40:34.540 --> 40:35.440]  How's anybody gonna know?
[40:35.580 --> 40:39.400]  So would we be importing from the actual gift shops?
[40:39.740 --> 40:40.900]  No, we would make our own.
[40:41.080 --> 40:41.260]  No.
[40:41.440 --> 40:41.680]  From scratch.
[40:41.880 --> 40:43.840]  Can we trademark a location?
[40:44.320 --> 40:48.440]  Like, is somebody gonna tell me I can't make a shirt for Butte, Montana?
[40:49.260 --> 40:49.620]  No.
[40:49.860 --> 40:50.500]  Of course I can't.
[40:52.040 --> 40:52.480]  Yeah.
[40:52.580 --> 40:54.760]  This sounds like something Spencer's Gifts would do.
[40:56.600 --> 40:57.480]  I guess.
[40:58.000 --> 40:58.860]  We could do that.
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.060]  What if we also had a green screen and we could put you where the shirt is?
[41:03.200 --> 41:03.320]  Yeah.
[41:03.360 --> 41:03.940]  Now we're talking.
[41:04.260 --> 41:05.100]  Now we're talking.
[41:05.360 --> 41:06.080]  This is good.
[41:06.300 --> 41:06.900]  Now I'm in.
[41:07.920 --> 41:11.920]  Like, it'd be great for people lying about going somewhere.
[41:12.140 --> 41:12.260]  Exactly.
[41:12.460 --> 41:16.220]  I don't ever honestly want to go all the way to the Great Wall of China.
[41:16.420 --> 41:17.540]  It seems like a lot of effort.
[41:17.820 --> 41:23.480]  But if I had a shirt that said I went on it, I would look pretty fucking cool and I would totally pretend like I was there.
[41:23.480 --> 41:26.140]  Somebody would be like, oh my god, you went to the Great Wall of China.
[41:26.240 --> 41:27.520]  I'd be like, that's what the shirt says.
[41:28.820 --> 41:33.860]  Dude, between this and furking and the hiding spot, we can help people lie so much.
[41:34.300 --> 41:34.360]  Yeah.
[41:37.120 --> 41:40.300]  How close would the Great Wall of China have to be before you went to see it, Geoff?
[41:41.360 --> 41:43.680]  I'd have to already be in China for something else.
[41:44.320 --> 41:47.300]  No, but let's say it wasn't in China. Let's say it could be anywhere.
[41:48.500 --> 41:49.320]  How about this?
[41:49.320 --> 41:50.120]  An hour by car.
[41:50.400 --> 41:51.740]  If it was the Great Wall of, like, Third Street.
[41:51.740 --> 41:55.180]  An hour by car is the furthest I would go to see the Great Wall.
[41:55.260 --> 42:00.500]  Alright, maybe the Great Wall of China is a bad example because I probably would put a little bit of effort into going.
[42:01.160 --> 42:01.520]  Really?
[42:01.760 --> 42:04.940]  I think so. I mean, it's visible from space. That's pretty cool.
[42:05.260 --> 42:08.120]  How about this? Here's a place that I have no interest in ever going.
[42:08.300 --> 42:08.760]  Mount Everest.
[42:09.080 --> 42:10.780]  I don't ever want to go to base camp.
[42:11.000 --> 42:12.140]  I certainly don't want to climb it.
[42:12.340 --> 42:13.720]  I don't want to look at all the dead dudes.
[42:14.060 --> 42:16.820]  I don't want to wear a winter coat that long.
[42:17.660 --> 42:20.000]  I don't want to have oxygen strapped to me.
[42:20.000 --> 42:21.460]  I got no desire to do that.
[42:21.520 --> 42:27.920]  But, if I had a shirt that said, I climbed Mount Everest, I'd wear it all fucking day long and nobody would ever know the difference.
[42:28.960 --> 42:29.360]  Yeah.
[42:30.120 --> 42:32.300]  And I wouldn't even have to go there to get the shirt.
[42:32.660 --> 42:40.360]  I could just go to the store for places that you want people to think you went to but you didn't really go to dot com.
[42:40.360 --> 42:46.400]  You know there's gonna be, like, a stolen valor level of outrage from people who have summited Everest.
[42:46.400 --> 42:48.780]  It's like, hey, but I know people who have died up there.
[42:49.020 --> 42:50.040]  People will be livid.
[42:50.280 --> 42:50.960]  They'd hate you.
[42:52.320 --> 42:52.820]  I guess.
[42:52.840 --> 42:54.840]  I could see Geoff climbing Everest, though.
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.480]  Like, that's what I was trying to think in my head.
[42:56.500 --> 42:59.080]  If I saw Geoff in that shirt and I didn't know who Geoff was.
[42:59.280 --> 42:59.480]  Right.
[42:59.700 --> 43:02.240]  I don't think I would question that.
[43:02.420 --> 43:03.700]  I think I'd just assume.
[43:03.880 --> 43:08.140]  How often, and that's the real kicker right there, Andrew, and thank you for pointing that out.
[43:08.260 --> 43:10.080]  Because this is what it really boils down to.
[43:10.240 --> 43:14.800]  How often do you see a person, see a dude, let's say me, wearing a shirt?
[43:15.540 --> 43:18.360]  And you read the shirt and it says a little bit of information.
[43:18.580 --> 43:23.880]  Like a band that he likes, or a tour that he went to, or a summit that he climbed.
[43:24.200 --> 43:28.800]  How often do you go and talk to that person and go, oh, you went to Mount Rushmore?
[43:29.600 --> 43:31.500]  Or you went to wherever the fuck it was? Everest?
[43:32.440 --> 43:33.420]  You're not gonna do that.
[43:33.600 --> 43:35.860]  You're just gonna go, oh, that dude went to Everest.
[43:35.960 --> 43:36.400]  That's cool.
[43:37.340 --> 43:42.260]  Yeah, it would have to, something would have to happen that it would force a conversation to occur.
[43:42.340 --> 43:42.520]  Right.
[43:42.520 --> 43:48.360]  Like maybe we're in like an elevator and it broke or something, or just like some, there'd have to be some scenario.
[43:48.460 --> 43:49.900]  Then you can go, oh, yeah, I guess I did.
[43:50.140 --> 43:54.780]  Or you can go, uh, no, I got it at the Goodwill or whatever, if you're embarrassed.
[43:55.120 --> 43:58.980]  But nine times out of ten, most people are just gonna see it and assume you climbed Mount Everest.
[43:59.320 --> 44:00.580]  And they're gonna be like, wow, that dude's awesome.
[44:01.080 --> 44:03.360]  Yeah, it's an impressive feat, is what I would think.
[44:03.440 --> 44:03.680]  Yeah.
[44:04.420 --> 44:06.280]  I wonder how often you did it, honestly.
[44:06.680 --> 44:09.700]  You could have done it multiple times, you're not gonna buy a shirt every time you climb it.
[44:09.700 --> 44:11.620]  You can even get fantastical about it too, right?
[44:11.680 --> 44:16.400]  You could get like a shirt that says like, I discovered and went to and saw El Dorado.
[44:17.180 --> 44:18.060]  Nobody's gonna know.
[44:19.440 --> 44:21.980]  Yeah, I wonder how the Atlantis shirts would do.
[44:22.180 --> 44:26.600]  There is something hilarious to me about what if this is your whole wardrobe?
[44:27.220 --> 44:30.220]  Could you imagine somebody going into your wardrobe for the first time?
[44:30.360 --> 44:34.460]  I was at Everest. I went to the Titanic. I went to El Dorado.
[44:34.600 --> 44:38.680]  Like just every shirt is a accomplishment, an achievement.
[44:38.680 --> 44:45.060]  It's a, I'll tell you what, it's an even cooler wardrobe than a bunch of logos that look like ACDC but aren't actually ACDC.
[44:45.740 --> 44:51.020]  That's a great point. I'd much rather have a I went to Everest shirt.
[44:51.240 --> 44:55.020]  Like think of all the, I've never been to Mount Fuji, but nobody has to know that.
[44:55.920 --> 45:01.600]  Honestly, I don't, we could even combine the two. You could use the ACDC font for I went to Everest.
[45:03.680 --> 45:06.900]  Why stop? Why restrict the two things? Let's blend them.
[45:06.900 --> 45:12.640]  Where is a place, where is a place that we all want to pretend we've been to that we haven't been to?
[45:12.720 --> 45:14.420]  Like, can we decide on one location?
[45:16.560 --> 45:19.700]  Huh. Like collect, like we all agree that this would be a good place?
[45:19.720 --> 45:23.060]  Like we would all wear this shirt that says that we went there and we don't actually want to go there.
[45:24.440 --> 45:29.000]  Oh. Uh. Huh. Is there any place that I actually want to go?
[45:30.420 --> 45:33.380]  Well, you once you once said, Andrew, you wouldn't travel more than 10 blocks.
[45:33.520 --> 45:37.180]  Even if those blue roofs from Greece were 10 blocks away.
[45:37.520 --> 45:41.800]  Yeah. Well, no, that's that needs to be my neighbor's house for me to actually pursue that.
[45:41.840 --> 45:45.000]  I've seen roofs. I can paint my roof blue.
[45:46.520 --> 45:48.100]  Well, you can't see your own roof. I'm not impressed by that.
[45:48.980 --> 45:53.940]  I mean, when I step outside, I can, I can look up, I can go up the street and go, oh, it's a blue roof.
[45:53.940 --> 45:55.940]  All right. How about this?
[45:57.140 --> 45:59.420]  Have you guys ever been to the Badlands?
[46:00.400 --> 46:02.020]  Is that Borderlands DLC?
[46:02.760 --> 46:05.520]  No, the Badlands. I've never been there.
[46:06.260 --> 46:07.200]  Where's the Badlands?
[46:08.080 --> 46:09.660]  It's it's in South Dakota.
[46:10.160 --> 46:12.960]  Is that a Jim Carrey movie? The Badlands? Badlands?
[46:13.200 --> 46:14.820]  Or South Dakota? Yeah, with Jason Momoa.
[46:15.260 --> 46:16.120]  What was that movie?
[46:17.400 --> 46:20.240]  Badland? Jim Carrey and Jason Momoa? They're in a desert?
[46:20.700 --> 46:21.900]  Well, this is... I'm probably way off.
[46:21.900 --> 46:23.800]  The Badlands is pretty desert-y.
[46:24.200 --> 46:25.820]  Oh, so it's just a bunch of mountains?
[46:26.500 --> 46:29.140]  Yeah, it's just Badlands. Like, you can't live out there. There's nothing there.
[46:30.100 --> 46:31.420]  Andrew, you're thinking of Badbatch.
[46:31.640 --> 46:32.240]  Thank you.
[46:32.500 --> 46:32.820]  Okay.
[46:33.100 --> 46:33.460]  Like...
[46:33.460 --> 46:34.340]  What if Bad was in there?
[46:35.660 --> 46:43.160]  Like, I'm never going to go to the Badlands, but what if we made a shirt that says, I visited the Badlands and all I got was this awesome fucking shirt?
[46:44.240 --> 46:48.300]  See, I don't think... I think it has to be serious, the tone of the shirt, for it to work.
[46:48.700 --> 46:51.400]  If it comes across as a joke, then it kind of falls apart.
[46:51.400 --> 46:55.380]  Well, that's why I didn't say lousy shirt. That's why I said awesome fucking shirt, because I was taking it seriously.
[46:56.500 --> 46:58.140]  That's a good point. That's on me.
[46:58.280 --> 47:01.860]  I was trying to be serious about it. Specifically for that reason, Andrew.
[47:02.680 --> 47:05.300]  Anyway, just something to think about. Think about places around the world.
[47:05.680 --> 47:07.460]  I'm probably never going to go to Kyrgyzstan.
[47:08.680 --> 47:09.040]  Kyrgyzstan.
[47:09.180 --> 47:17.400]  And that is the one country, no matter how much I study the name of it, I can never frickin' spell Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan.
[47:17.760 --> 47:20.540]  So, what is like the best place to visit in Kyrgyzstan?
[47:21.580 --> 47:24.560]  Yeah, why... what even made you choose that? Why are you studying Kyrgyzstan?
[47:25.180 --> 47:31.080]  I just... I just wanted to be able to name all the countries, and I can't, because I'm rubbish, and I can't even spell that one.
[47:31.520 --> 47:35.880]  So, there's like some Y's and G's, and there's a Z, I think.
[47:36.320 --> 47:36.740]  Here we go!
[47:37.100 --> 47:42.580]  One of the most popular tourist destination points in Kyrgyzstan is the Lake Issyk-Kul.
[47:42.580 --> 47:46.360]  Numerous hotels, resorts, and boarding houses are located along its northern shore.
[47:46.480 --> 47:51.440]  The most popular beach zones are in the city of Cholpanata and settlements nearby.
[47:51.600 --> 47:56.640]  So, we just need to make beachwear for Issyk-Kul and Cholpanata, and then we're set.
[47:57.400 --> 47:57.740]  There you go!
[47:57.940 --> 47:59.440]  More than a million people a year visit there.
[48:01.280 --> 48:04.140]  Uh, except... well, they used to. Used to. At a different time.
[48:05.400 --> 48:08.740]  Doesn't exist anymore. My number one, where I want to go, is Cyber City.
[48:09.180 --> 48:12.840]  There's an arcade. That was where I lived, and they shut it down. We don't have any arcades anymore.
[48:13.040 --> 48:17.460]  Cyber City. My number one. I'd love a I've-been-to-Cyber-City shirt.
[48:17.980 --> 48:26.520]  Well, now, why does it have to be in the here and now? Why can't we expand this to back in time?
[48:26.880 --> 48:27.420]  That's true.
[48:27.960 --> 48:30.260]  Like, I saw the fall of Rome.
[48:31.300 --> 48:32.940]  Oh, Cyber City. That looks pretty cool.
[48:33.540 --> 48:34.260]  It was great.
[48:34.640 --> 48:36.580]  It looks like you could ride your bike up that side.
[48:36.580 --> 48:38.840]  We could even do this in the F*** Face universe.
[48:39.060 --> 48:45.720]  We could set up a little shack at the Puddle of Piss that Andrew watched and sell shirts for that.
[48:46.020 --> 48:50.100]  Nobody needs that. Nobody wants... I didn't even want to be there for that.
[48:50.180 --> 48:52.180]  I don't know why I'd have a shirt that said I was.
[48:52.180 --> 48:55.420]  I witnessed the Vancouver Island McDonald's Piss Lady.
[48:55.680 --> 48:59.260]  Yeah, I feel like I'd love to go to that spot. I wouldn't want to stand exactly on it.
[48:59.300 --> 49:03.820]  I would just want to be, you know, in that moment of historical value amongst F*** Face.
[49:05.220 --> 49:08.740]  Oh, man. If we ever go there, Andrew, can you show me where it was?
[49:09.040 --> 49:12.660]  Yeah, absolutely. You can call me and I'll tell you to, like, step back, like, four feet.
[49:12.660 --> 49:14.800]  Why do I have to call you? Why wouldn't you come and just show me?
[49:15.120 --> 49:21.640]  Because we're trying to... I don't know. It would be easier for me to look out my window and be able to tell you where it was.
[49:24.280 --> 49:27.280]  It would be easier for you to look out your window?
[49:27.280 --> 49:33.800]  Well, just because, like, I don't know necessarily. If I was on the ground, I don't know if I could accurately guess where it was.
[49:33.800 --> 49:35.460]  Why don't you film through a telescope?
[49:35.520 --> 49:36.760]  I need the same perspective.
[49:37.140 --> 49:40.380]  And you'll just hear me down the phone and you can be, like, left a bit, back a bit.
[49:41.140 --> 49:47.760]  I could just yell. It's close enough I could yell. Just open the door and I'll just yell at you. I guess we don't even really need phones, but yeah.
[49:47.800 --> 49:50.340]  Oh, so you were close enough where she could have seen you watching?
[49:51.240 --> 49:53.060]  Uh, yeah, absolutely. I think so.
[49:53.060 --> 49:54.840]  I thought they were making eye contact when it happened.
[49:54.860 --> 49:56.600]  Oh, okay. I thought they were a little bit further out.
[49:57.420 --> 50:02.660]  No. They were, they're a little, it's like a parking lot type thing away.
[50:03.980 --> 50:13.600]  There's a distance. There is a distance, but yeah, you could, I'd assume you could see. I've never been to that location and looked back, but yeah.
[50:14.360 --> 50:18.860]  I'd love to, I'd love to go there. I'd love to check that off my list of places I want to go.
[50:18.880 --> 50:25.020]  Are you going to have my doorbell in your hand when you do it? Taunt me from a distance?
[50:25.420 --> 50:27.440]  What's the, what's the thumbstick update?
[50:27.840 --> 50:32.680]  I've been trying to look into the fucking, the camera thing. I'm just going to start. I'm just going to start.
[50:32.980 --> 50:33.600]  Without the camera?
[50:34.280 --> 50:35.400]  Without the camera. Yeah.
[50:35.560 --> 50:36.580]  What's there to look into?
[50:36.600 --> 50:37.300]  Do you want proof that it's too bad?
[50:37.960 --> 50:44.760]  I was looking into if I could use my Kinect. The Kinect doesn't work at all for the console. And I was looking into camera options.
[50:45.020 --> 50:47.060]  Yeah, you can use a, like a Logitech.
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.180]  I could. Yeah. I'm just going to start up as intended.
[50:52.560 --> 50:52.720]  What?
[50:52.720 --> 50:54.020]  I don't like you moving the goalposts.
[50:54.020 --> 50:57.120]  Well, it's not really a moving goalpost.
[50:57.260 --> 51:01.240]  Well, it was never discussed and then it arrived and then all of a sudden it became a thing, even though we talked about it a lot.
[51:01.960 --> 51:08.120]  And if we want to talk about lack of proof, when you and I did the Halo 2 time challenge, I was the only one streaming that. I didn't see you play at all.
[51:08.720 --> 51:12.580]  You just went off. You just did it and then claimed you had the time.
[51:13.540 --> 51:15.000]  Yeah, that's true. I mean, it's just...
[51:15.000 --> 51:15.760]  That's a pretty good point there.
[51:16.440 --> 51:18.940]  It was quite a, you know, quite a visual challenge.
[51:19.760 --> 51:20.200]  Yeah.
[51:20.600 --> 51:22.200]  Kind of comically large controller.
[51:23.220 --> 51:25.040]  Watch somebody try to use it successfully.
[51:25.720 --> 51:28.380]  Printed them and mailed them across the country and all that.
[51:29.720 --> 51:31.720]  I mean, internationally, just so we're clear.
[51:31.760 --> 51:31.980]  Oh, yeah.
[51:32.000 --> 51:32.940]  That's true. It did leave America.
[51:35.320 --> 51:35.760]  Yeah.
[51:36.700 --> 51:36.920]  Yeah.
[51:37.380 --> 51:38.880]  How's everyone? What's everybody else been doing?
[51:39.900 --> 51:44.440]  You went to Sloppy Joe's and it's crazy you haven't talked about it yet. What are you doing?
[51:44.740 --> 51:45.200]  You didn't even...
[51:45.200 --> 51:50.340]  I mean, we're 45 minutes in and we just got to it.
[51:50.480 --> 51:51.680]  Geoff went, oh, I don't have anything.
[51:52.020 --> 51:54.100]  We didn't lead. We didn't lead with it.
[51:54.100 --> 51:55.700]  You were at Sloppy Joe's.
[51:55.700 --> 51:59.180]  I had Jack come up to me and be like, hey, you know about this? And Eric was like, hey, do you see this?
[51:59.280 --> 51:59.880]  I was like, what?
[51:59.980 --> 52:01.840]  Okay, well, two things.
[52:01.980 --> 52:02.980]  I had it tweeted to me.
[52:03.260 --> 52:12.200]  Two things. First off, one, I don't know how he's made it into his fucking 40s and still hasn't learned to keep his fucking mouth shut.
[52:12.200 --> 52:17.860]  But Jack needs to stop fucking sharing information that's not his to share around.
[52:18.400 --> 52:22.120]  If I'd wanted you guys to know I was at Sloppy Joe's, I would have told you I was at Sloppy Joe's ahead of time.
[52:22.200 --> 52:28.120]  And second, just because some people told you I was at Sloppy Joe's doesn't mean I was definitely actually there.
[52:28.660 --> 52:31.240]  Oh, so you're saying you may not have been at Sloppy Joe's.
[52:32.620 --> 52:34.360]  I mean, it's possible that I wasn't there.
[52:35.380 --> 52:39.560]  I mean, Eric just posted a screenshot of what appears to be you and him.
[52:39.560 --> 52:42.300]  The screenshot appears to be two blonde ladies looking down.
[52:42.460 --> 52:43.920]  I can't believe...
[52:44.540 --> 52:46.820]  Right, the two people were not looking.
[52:46.900 --> 52:50.360]  I can't believe you didn't do that while we were playing bingo.
[52:52.340 --> 52:53.200]  What do you mean?
[52:53.420 --> 52:53.560]  What?
[52:54.340 --> 53:00.480]  You can't believe I didn't go all the way to Sloppy Joe's while I was playing bingo with you at the time?
[53:01.160 --> 53:03.600]  As in, like, you could have just been around the corner playing bingo.
[53:04.200 --> 53:07.400]  What are you talking... what world are you living in?
[53:07.400 --> 53:09.680]  Because we always talked about how... what?
[53:09.840 --> 53:15.140]  We always talked about how it'd be funny if we were all playing bingo and then suddenly one of us was like, okay, one sec, and then we're just on the stream.
[53:15.380 --> 53:17.720]  Like, we're playing from an Airbnb around the corner.
[53:17.960 --> 53:21.420]  That would be really funny, but the logistics of how you do that become very complicated.
[53:21.420 --> 53:24.320]  What do you mean? The hard part is getting all the way there? He was already there!
[53:24.860 --> 53:28.060]  I would argue that being there is the easiest part of that whole bit.
[53:28.240 --> 53:31.780]  He could have just been like, alright, we're playing bingo at this time. Bam. We would never have known.
[53:32.180 --> 53:35.000]  I think we would... he'd sound like shit. He wouldn't sound like himself.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.820]  There'd be noises in the background. There'd be a fucking parade happening.
[53:39.740 --> 53:46.700]  What are you saying? Where is he staying? Is there a hotel near Sloppy Joe's, Geoff, that you could do this realistically?
[53:46.800 --> 53:48.460]  You could do a podcast from that street.
[53:48.660 --> 53:50.920]  Yeah. No, not from the street.
[53:51.600 --> 53:52.800]  No, absolutely not.
[53:52.920 --> 53:53.280]  Duval Street?
[53:55.500 --> 53:58.880]  The street that Sloppy Joe's is on is a street called Duval Street.
[53:59.060 --> 54:01.040]  It is 15 blocks long.
[54:01.040 --> 54:07.680]  It runs from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico.
[54:07.920 --> 54:11.800]  So it goes from ocean to ocean. It's the width of Key West.
[54:12.680 --> 54:15.660]  So you can literally walk from one end of the ocean to the other, which is kind of cool.
[54:16.320 --> 54:19.780]  But it's all bars and restaurants. I don't know if there's any hotels on that street.
[54:19.840 --> 54:23.840]  But my hotel was three blocks from Sloppy Joe's. I was right there.
[54:23.960 --> 54:25.580]  So I easily could have done what you're describing.
[54:25.860 --> 54:27.600]  Yeah. That's what I was saying.
[54:27.620 --> 54:29.780]  I didn't do that, though. What I did do was go on vacation.
[54:29.780 --> 54:34.580]  No, but the timing, the seamlessness of it. You couldn't pull that off.
[54:34.900 --> 54:43.460]  If it helps you, Geoff going and doing this helped everyone else with Bingo as he was, I think, a crosswalk coward.
[54:43.540 --> 54:43.900]  Oh, yeah.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.800]  You're sucking on chili dogs. Acknowledge the camera.
[54:48.160 --> 54:55.780]  Oh, I did a selfie. I dropped something. I shook Emily's hand.
[54:56.300 --> 54:56.920]  Did you throw up?
[54:57.640 --> 54:59.640]  I didn't throw up. I couldn't throw up.
[54:59.640 --> 55:08.120]  I did a bunch of stuff. Actually, so the goal was first off, I went to Key West for Fourth of July weekend just to get away.
[55:08.200 --> 55:12.940]  We wanted to go somewhere. It wasn't specifically it wasn't even really going to be Key West necessarily.
[55:13.260 --> 55:17.200]  It could have been we threw places in a hat and we just ended up pulling out Key West.
[55:17.300 --> 55:19.280]  And we were like, oh, it seems appropriate. Fuck it. Let's go.
[55:20.260 --> 55:24.640]  I hadn't been in like 17 years or something. And so and Emily had never been.
[55:24.640 --> 55:31.060]  First off, I got to say, Key West is awesome in every way. It is so worth going to.
[55:31.600 --> 55:36.820]  We drove we flew to Miami and rented a car and drove down to Key West because I wanted to do that drive again.
[55:37.040 --> 55:38.160]  How far is that? The drive is amazing.
[55:39.840 --> 55:43.600]  It's like three hours, maybe four hours, somewhere around there.
[55:43.840 --> 55:47.620]  But it's like you're just driving down. You're just driving from island to island to island.
[55:47.820 --> 55:49.580]  You know, it's just hopping islands. It's fucking cool.
[55:51.680 --> 55:58.300]  And so we got there. I didn't really have any agenda in terms of like what to do with Sloppy Joe's or anything.
[55:58.460 --> 56:06.380]  But we so what we came up with was I wanted to try to sneak on camera as many times as possible and see.
[56:06.560 --> 56:13.320]  And the goal Emily and I had for ourselves through there for four days was to try to get on camera 30 times without anybody noticing.
[56:13.940 --> 56:17.640]  Oh, my God. We got caught instantly.
[56:18.400 --> 56:22.160]  So there are people just bingoing away or watching the stream all the time.
[56:22.160 --> 56:26.440]  I think within like five minutes of us appearing on camera, it was on Reddit.
[56:26.860 --> 56:29.360]  Yeah, it was pretty crazy because I thought we were going to get a lot further along.
[56:30.200 --> 56:35.980]  People haven't seen all of us, obviously, because we were doing like we we would go by.
[56:36.140 --> 56:39.820]  We took the ghost, the ghost yards and graveyards thing.
[56:40.300 --> 56:43.360]  We took that. We were going up and down the street in that waving.
[56:43.360 --> 56:48.360]  We did. We did. You know, that little that little choo-choo train that goes by.
[56:48.460 --> 56:52.560]  We took that. So, wow. I'm on there every time that we appeared on video.
[56:52.700 --> 56:57.300]  Emily would screen grab it from YouTube. And so I think we have a little video cut together of like the nine.
[56:57.680 --> 57:00.360]  Oh, that's awesome. Did you rent a couple of go-karts?
[57:01.280 --> 57:04.540]  Man, I couldn't find a go-kart to rent. I wanted to.
[57:04.700 --> 57:11.120]  What we did end up doing is renting. So we were going to rent a golf cart just to drive around for a day because it's fucking hot, dude.
[57:11.120 --> 57:14.160]  It's like it's hot in Texas. It's so much hotter there.
[57:14.460 --> 57:18.280]  Maybe not temperature wise, but because of the humidity, it's just brutal.
[57:19.480 --> 57:21.500]  And so they were out of golf carts.
[57:21.880 --> 57:32.480]  So we rented a scooter, like a little Vespa, which I haven't ridden since I flipped that one a couple of years ago and and got fucked myself all up, you know, did that whole thing.
[57:33.180 --> 57:36.240]  And so I was a little nervous about it. But Emily was like, you'll be fine.
[57:36.800 --> 57:39.440]  Turns out I was fine. It was a lot of fun.
[57:40.500 --> 57:43.880]  Emily made it about three blocks before she was like, I'm too scared to ride with you.
[57:44.100 --> 57:47.220]  And so we had to turn the scooter back in. She was not having it.
[57:48.000 --> 57:49.280]  She didn't like being a scooter passenger.
[57:49.680 --> 57:51.900]  Worse than the helicopter then, because she didn't turn that around.
[57:52.700 --> 57:55.540]  No, the helicopter, she stuck it out. She did not stick it out with a scooter.
[57:56.380 --> 57:58.600]  She made an hour with the helicopter, maybe 20 minutes with the scooter.
[57:58.880 --> 58:02.060]  What was it like to look at the camera? What did it look like? We've seen what it looked like, I guess.
[58:02.920 --> 58:04.140]  I can send you pictures, actually.
[58:04.360 --> 58:05.500]  Did you go inside the bar?
[58:06.160 --> 58:07.500]  Yeah, I ate dinner there.
[58:07.600 --> 58:07.980]  Is it cool?
[58:07.980 --> 58:08.740]  Wow.
[58:10.040 --> 58:11.000]  It was good?
[58:11.660 --> 58:14.980]  Yeah, like it's... I'll be honest, it's...
[58:15.800 --> 58:19.580]  Oh, I have so many thoughts. I'm a little scatterbrained. Let me send these photos to you real fast.
[58:19.940 --> 58:20.380]  Okay.
[58:21.000 --> 58:21.440]  Oh!
[58:22.980 --> 58:24.100]  That's the inner feed.
[58:24.540 --> 58:25.320]  Yeah, that was us.
[58:25.780 --> 58:26.220]  Wow.
[58:26.300 --> 58:27.680]  I didn't even know there was an inner feed.
[58:27.680 --> 58:30.080]  Somebody caught us eating inside.
[58:30.300 --> 58:32.620]  Do you think that's where Errol Flynn sat?
[58:35.580 --> 58:36.660]  His favorite table.
[58:36.660 --> 58:38.960]  I'm just gonna say these are all the photos I took.
[58:39.340 --> 58:40.320]  I'm fascinated by this.
[58:40.540 --> 58:43.820]  Yeah, this is... I didn't... I really didn't know that there was a feed like that.
[58:44.320 --> 58:45.600]  That really opens things up.
[58:45.760 --> 58:50.240]  I feel like you have a good chance of finding a dumb hat almost any time in the evening with that feed.
[58:50.880 --> 58:57.820]  Okay, so there's the top left photo is just where we were sitting at in that other photo you saw of us eating food right out of the gate.
[58:57.900 --> 58:58.740]  Food? Awesome.
[58:59.220 --> 59:02.300]  Like, really good. I had really good Cajun fries.
[59:03.180 --> 59:06.340]  I had a really... everything was really good except for the Sloppy Joe.
[59:06.420 --> 59:07.820]  The Sloppy Joe was pretty fucking terrible.
[59:08.320 --> 59:11.720]  It was like... it was like sweet and just not good.
[59:12.040 --> 59:14.940]  But I had a hot dog that was fantastic.
[59:15.260 --> 59:16.180]  Like, really good.
[59:16.360 --> 59:19.120]  And is that the one you sucked on outside in front of the camera?
[59:19.700 --> 59:21.440]  No, oh, that's another story.
[59:21.760 --> 59:26.640]  So you know how sometimes you'll see a guy walk by with a shirt that says Hey F*** Face and it looks like the North Face logo?
[59:27.820 --> 59:31.300]  Walked around the corner to go find out where the people are grabbing the chili dogs.
[59:31.300 --> 59:36.840]  And there's a hot dog vendor right there selling hot dogs in the Hey F*** Face shirt.
[59:37.100 --> 59:38.140]  It's his thing.
[59:38.540 --> 59:39.260]  And he's like...
[59:39.600 --> 59:39.840]  Yeah.
[59:39.980 --> 59:45.180]  Emily, I don't have it with me, but Emily took a photo of me and the F*** Face dude standing next to each other.
[59:45.640 --> 59:47.340]  And I meant to go back and buy one.
[59:47.360 --> 59:48.280]  He sells those shirts.
[59:48.420 --> 59:49.780]  He's like, yeah, I sell aprons and shirts.
[59:49.780 --> 59:50.360]  I'll sell you one.
[59:50.540 --> 59:51.320]  And I just forgot.
[59:51.460 --> 59:52.260]  You met the North Face F*** Face guy?
[59:52.440 --> 59:53.860]  I met the North Face F*** Face guy.
[59:55.000 --> 59:55.180]  Yeah.
[59:55.500 --> 59:56.580]  That was the craziest thing.
[59:56.640 --> 59:58.640]  It's like everybody there I recognized and knew.
[59:58.780 --> 59:59.340]  It was weird.
[59:59.340 --> 01:00:03.580]  All the homeless people, all the employees, everybody I recognized at the gate.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:08.280]  You can see I took a photo of the camera right there where it says Duval Street.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.140]  It is so hard to see.
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.560]  It's so unassuming.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.060]  Oh, really?
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.560]  Most people don't know it's there.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.160]  Like, you can see it in the selfie I took.
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.520]  That was just a selfie I was taking for the live cam that night.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.900]  I don't think I'd even look up there.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.340]  I don't think you would either.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:23.440]  There's lights blinding you.
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:23.660]  It's subtle.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.220]  Most people have no idea it's there.
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:27.480]  They really don't.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.740]  A couple of other observations.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.180]  Sloppy Joe's is awesome.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:36.640]  That block, it looks like Sloppy Joe's is like the center of the universe, the way the camera is set up.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:39.080]  And then everything kind of gravitates towards that.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.920]  And it looks like it kind of bleeds off and dies out in the other directions.
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:42.960]  Not the case.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.300]  Every block on Duval Street is as crowded and packed as Sloppy Joe's.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.240]  It's like, it is that crowded everywhere.
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:54.280]  That place across the street, Rick's, that you can see in the other feed.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.200]  That place is way busier than Sloppy Joe's.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.540]  And bigger, actually.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.280]  Sloppy Joe's is busy, don't get me wrong.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.980]  People are fucking beloved.
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.360]  I bought you guys koozies, by the way.
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:04.120]  I got everybody a koozie.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.100]  Oh, I love it.
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:05.860]  Thank you so much.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:06.520]  Yeah, no worries, man.
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.480]  Of course, I'm going to get you guys stuff.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:16.000]  Oh, and Eric, I got for our break show set, I got a Sloppy Joe's bar mat.
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:17.400]  Nice.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.540]  Wow, that's awesome.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.080]  Oh my god.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:21.560]  They've merchandised the shit out of that place.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.220]  But yeah, so like any direction, like you see people peel off to the left or to the right or wherever.
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:26.860]  They're not going home.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.960]  They're going to a thousand other restaurants and bars.
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.520]  That place is very lively.
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:38.500]  Also, the other big observation, the big illumination, I'll say, that Emily and I had.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:42.960]  We played two full rounds of Sloppy Joe's Bingo at Sloppy Joe's.
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.180]  One under the camera.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.060]  Wow.
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:46.740]  And then one across the street.
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.320]  I thought we were on camera, but we weren't.
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:49.480]  We were just off camera.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:02:01.580]  And the big observation is everybody you see on camera on that Sloppy Joe's live cam is at least twice as drunk as they look.
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:07.680]  Something about the angle makes people look more sober than they are.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:11.120]  It's rough on the streets, dude.
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:17.900]  When you're looking at those people at eye level, every single person is stumbling and glassy-eyed and hammered.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:22.980]  From about 8pm on, they're all just toasted out of their minds, dude.
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:27.500]  It's the first time in my life I realized that the camera doesn't do alcohol justice.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.880]  They look so much more put together when you're looking at the top of their head than they do when you're staring at them in the eyes.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.880]  Did that make you re-evaluate Sloppy Joe's when the time was?
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:43.100]  No! I'll be honest, Sloppy Joe's is kind of an arbitrary thing anyway.
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.600]  But it made me appreciate it all more.
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:52.940]  And it made me understand that what I'm watching is actually drunker and funnier than I realized, if that helps.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:58.200]  Like, if anything, this trip really just bolstered my love of Sloppy Joe's.
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:03.740]  I wonder if that keeps going as you get lower. Like, if you're sat on the street, does everyone look drunker from there?
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:06.900]  I sat on the street! I did that.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.660]  One of those, so somebody can get that.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:15.660]  It was also, by the way, so, so, so much fun to play on the street.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.760]  Except that people are fucking drunk and they see you looking at them.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:27.340]  And everybody, it's like Sixth Street, you know, where you're like, every time you make eye contact with a drunk dude, you're like, well, we'll see how this goes.
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:31.700]  So there is a bit of that, but it's a pretty, it's a pretty happy place.
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:35.180]  And I assume you can't scream trip over at people if you're playing there in the open.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.760]  Yeah, and you can't do that.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.460]  You can't yell dumb hat and point.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.180]  Stupid mallet!
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:41.980]  Offensive t-shirt!
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:48.640]  Also, I will say, because Emily would be mad at me if I didn't bring this up, although I don't, it's not my story to tell.
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.240]  I don't know how to do it.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:58.160]  But according to Emily, she has never seen me nervous and starstruck before in any situation.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:03.060]  But she said when we got to Sloppy Joe's, I turned into a puddle.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.080]  She said I was just like, I didn't want to go.
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.280]  She's right. I didn't think about it at the time.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.620]  I didn't want to go into the store.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:09.240]  I don't want to make eye contact with the employees.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.360]  I was like nervous.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.540]  There's a hole to the right of Sloppy Joe's.
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:20.740]  Actually, the entrance that you see people walk into the closest to camera is a little store where you can go buy t-shirts and shit.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.340]  And I felt awkward.
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.400]  I felt weird.
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:29.700]  I felt like everybody knew I was the guy who made the game that was kind of making fun of them, but not really.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.040]  I was just so nervous.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.760]  We had to leave, and I had to calm down and come back later.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:34.620]  That's great.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.140]  And it was also just like, I just love it so much.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.620]  Yeah, it's your thing.
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.940]  I assume that's how I'm going to be when I see Andrew again.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.000]  I think so, probably.
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:42.620]  Starstruck?
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:47.480]  Yeah, like when I'm there at your door trying to screw the Monopoly money to it, I'm just going to be freaking out.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.100]  I'm going to have to psych myself up.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.480]  We'll break through that while I'm telling you where the puddle of piss is.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.040]  I think that'll be like the icebreaker.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.560]  I'll bring this back.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:57.640]  The pissbreaker.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:58.920]  That's great.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:04:59.420]  I'm so glad.
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:03.040]  That was one of my main questions is, did this heighten your experience in watching it?
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.360]  And it sounds like it absolutely did.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:10.980]  And I gotta be, I gotta say, you know, we were doing vacations at that little island, Isla Mujeres, for a while in Mexico.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:11.880]  We haven't been there in a minute.
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.960]  I want to move everything over to Key West.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.680]  Like, I just want to go back to Key West immediately.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:16.820]  And I want you guys to go.
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:18.100]  Yeah, I'd love to go.
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:19.000]  I want us to do a f*** face thing there.
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:19.480]  That sounds great.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.720]  I want us to do weekend getaway vacations there.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.140]  It's just fucking awesome.
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.140]  Oh, I didn't even tell you guys.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.000]  That's not all I did.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:25.900]  Guess what I did?
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:26.800]  Oh my God.
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:27.900]  Holy shit.
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:29.200]  Holy shit.
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:29.720]  What did you do?
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:30.580]  Jet skiing.
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:31.880]  I went jet skiing in the ocean.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.080]  You went jet skiing?
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:33.920]  I said it as a joke.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:34.420]  Are you serious?
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.380]  In the ocean.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:36.700]  Oh my God.
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:37.540]  Oh my God.
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:38.380]  Guys.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.760]  It's different.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.600]  It's so fucking different.
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:43.280]  It's so much better.
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:46.060]  What we were doing was not jet skiing.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:47.460]  Jet skiing in the ocean?
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:49.420]  It's a whole other world, man.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.500]  Well, surely you can't go 50 miles an hour in the ocean.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.100]  You can.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.020]  You can.
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:54.600]  You can go.
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.240]  I got up to 46 was the fastest mine went.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:57.940]  On waves?
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:05:59.160]  Yeah.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:05:59.740]  What?
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.240]  What if you come up for waves?
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.760]  Do you land on a different wave?
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.480]  Sometimes you go through a wave.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.780]  You just go through it like you pierce it.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:10.920]  It's fucking wild.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:14.120]  It's fucking wild.
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.240]  So you're an ocean jet skier now.
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:17.220]  Yeah, dude.
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:21.900]  And the tour we did, we got on jet skis and we did the entire fucking island.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.460]  Like we circled Key West in jet skis.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:27.620]  Which means I went through two oceans on jet skis.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:28.880]  Damn.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:29.600]  Wow.
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.600]  It was fucking awesome.
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.300]  So you like circled Duval Street?
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.300]  Yeah, I did.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:35.860]  I did.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:36.920]  I totally did.
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:37.420]  That's awesome.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:38.440]  Yeah.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:43.380]  And I got to see all kinds of crazy like they call people who live on the water there.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.020]  They call it living off the hook.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:48.140]  And it's kind of it's kind of a derogatory term.
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:48.960]  It's kind of an insult.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.720]  And I didn't quite understand it until I was out there on the jet ski.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:55.120]  There's like parts of Key West that look like Waterworld.
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.700]  Where it's just like old boats that don't sail anymore.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.180]  That are just stuck.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.580]  And there's people that have built like corrugated metal like huts on top of them.
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.020]  And just live there.
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:09.020]  Living off the hook.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:09.820]  And there's like...
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:10.320]  That's crazy.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:11.660]  You jet ski around them.
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:12.660]  And you really are like...
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:13.640]  It's like post-apocalyptic.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:14.600]  It's fucking wild.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:15.520]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.280]  Did you see Dennis Hopper?
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:17.760]  God, I wish.
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:18.880]  Looked for him.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:23.680]  Anyway.
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:27.120]  Do you think your lake experience now, is that going to be weakened?
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.420]  Can you go back to your standard jet ski?
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.940]  Like will this change that for you, you think?
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.900]  Now that you've experienced the ocean lifestyle?
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.720]  The lake experience had already been lessened a bit.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.820]  Just because we'd done it so much.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.340]  And there's only...
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:41.400]  I imagine the swan too.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.680]  Yeah, the swan too.
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:43.900]  Well, we've done it so much.
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.240]  And Lake Austin is quite small.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.740]  So it's like you basically...
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:48.640]  Every time we rent a jet ski, we go...
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.360]  Okay, let's go from here to the end.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.700]  And then to the other end and back.
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.360]  And you just do a full loop and then you're done.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.060]  And so that gets old after like...
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:57.320]  I don't know, 20 times doing it.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:02.400]  Did you almost hit any other kinds of dead bloated wildlife when you were in the ocean?
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:03.560]  No.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.080]  No, I didn't.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:07.140]  But...
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:11.480]  Some people did see a giant sea turtle when we were coming in.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.180]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:15.640]  I want to go.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.500]  I want to go to Key West and I want to jet ski on the ocean.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.800]  Dude, it's fucking awesome.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:24.280]  It's not any more expensive than jet skiing in the regular land or in lakes.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.340]  And it's way more thrilling.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:27.760]  And yeah.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.500]  And anyway, so Key West is just...
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.360]  It's better than I remembered it.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.960]  It's nicer than I remembered it.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.280]  It's...
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:36.860]  Sloppy Joe's is better than I could have imagined it.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:37.800]  It's incredibly...
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:39.980]  And I mean this with all sincerity.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.240]  It's all very charming.
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.480]  Like it's...
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.800]  I remember it being kind of trashy and like...
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:46.380]  Trashy.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.460]  A little trashy.
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:49.480]  Key West being just kind of trashy.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.060]  Yeah.
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.520]  I mean, that's definitely the vibe I got looking at the feed.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:53.800]  And it's...
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:54.320]  It's...
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:54.820]  There is...
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:57.840]  It is still a little trashy, but it's so much more charming than that.
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:58.320]  And...
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.080]  Oh, that's great.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.240]  It's just wonderful.
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:01.120]  Yeah, really great.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:01.800]  I'd love to hear that.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:02.300]  Really great.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.180]  And so I hope that...
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:07.000]  I hope that our Sloppy Joe's future is bright and long.
[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:08.660]  That was a fast hour.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.400]  This was a fun episode.
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:10.520]  Yeah, that was good.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.820]  I missed you guys.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:12.840]  Yeah, I missed you guys.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.060]  I didn't really get to any of my stuff.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:14.600]  That was lovely.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:15.380]  Oh, shit.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:15.860]  Next time.
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:16.240]  Next time.
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:17.220]  Next week.
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:17.840]  Next week.
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.220]  Episode 165.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:20.600]  Tune in.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.560]  The Gavin episode.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:22.340]  Ooh.
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:26.120]  I mean, I hope to have some stuff to present from the lab.
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.580]  But that's probably my main thing.
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:28.060]  Next time.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:28.300]  Yep.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:29.760]  That's exciting.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:30.940]  Yes, indeed.
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.560]  Very excited.
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:36.620]  Hopefully, audience, you'll tune in next week for episode 165.
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:37.740]  The Gavin episode.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.080]  He's been in the lab.
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.460]  He's gonna blow your mind.
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:44.080]  And if you saw us at RTX, thank you for coming out.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.960]  Thank you for spending your time and your money supporting F*** Face.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:51.040]  And if I ran into you in Key West and took photos with you, hey, it was nice to see you.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:51.900]  Thanks for doing that.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:55.000]  And maybe I'll see you next vacation.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.440]  And if you listen to this and you hear me talking right now, thanks for listening to this.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.180]  And whatever else.
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:00.420]  Bye.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:01.000]  Bye.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.800]  Which thumbsticks will Andrew be on?
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:03.660]  We won't see it.
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:05.120]  Oh, come on.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:09.920]  Hey, guys.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:13.520]  Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:14.920]  Andrew broke it again.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.180]  Gavin has some interesting storage options.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.400]  Those shoes have no toes.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.900]  It's a pool noodle monstrosity.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.160]  Vegas was ungodly hot.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.800]  It's a digital craps table.
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:28.380]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.460]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
