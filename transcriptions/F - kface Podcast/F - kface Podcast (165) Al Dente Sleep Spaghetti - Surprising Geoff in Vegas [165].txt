[00:00.000 --> 00:02.480]  This episode is brought to you by Pacifico.
[00:02.920 --> 00:04.980]  Here's a story you've probably never heard.
[00:05.440 --> 00:10.440]  Legend has it, decades ago, a couple surfers went down to Mexico in search of epic swells,
[00:10.560 --> 00:12.380]  but they found something unexpected instead.
[00:12.780 --> 00:17.260]  It was still crisp, lively, and smooth, but it had nothing to do with waves.
[00:17.600 --> 00:20.140]  It was Pacifico, a delicious Mexican lager.
[00:20.600 --> 00:22.600]  It's like it was brewed to be discovered.
[00:23.280 --> 00:23.760]  Pacifico.

[00:40.280 --> 00:41.280]  Can't hear anybody.
[00:41.720 --> 00:41.940]  What?
[00:42.960 --> 00:43.640]  That's not good.
[00:46.360 --> 00:48.160]  I didn't even know anyone was in here.
[00:48.220 --> 00:49.300]  I thought I was still here by myself.
[00:49.440 --> 00:50.980]  This show fucking sucks.
[00:54.460 --> 00:57.440]  This show is dog shit.
[00:57.920 --> 00:58.960]  This sucks.
[00:59.360 --> 01:05.040]  This is episode 165.
[01:05.040 --> 01:11.020]  Our previous episode included Dodging a Bullet, Andrew's Prototypes, Not Being a Knife Guy,
[01:11.420 --> 01:15.940]  RTX, Summer of 98 Yearbook, The Golden Gurgler, Crazy Puffs, 4 Three Cheeses,
[01:16.360 --> 01:17.520]  Souvenir Shirts Business.
[01:17.680 --> 01:18.440]  I forgot about that.
[01:18.980 --> 01:24.120]  Geoff at Sloppy Joe's, The North Face, F*** Face Guy, and Ocean Jet Skiing.
[01:24.160 --> 01:25.560]  But that's all 164.
[01:25.600 --> 01:26.660]  This is 165, so go ahead.
[01:26.740 --> 01:27.580]  Eric, can I ask you a favor?
[01:27.920 --> 01:28.580]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:28.900 --> 01:32.380]  Can you not start the recap before 3 p.m., please?
[01:32.380 --> 01:40.360]  But the point of you getting here at 3 p.m. is that we start on time when you're here.
[01:40.520 --> 01:42.980]  Well, if the recap's in the episode, I have to disagree, Eric.
[01:43.960 --> 01:44.920]  I'm not...
[01:45.820 --> 01:46.300]  What?
[01:47.860 --> 01:49.220]  That's in the episode, isn't it?
[01:49.480 --> 01:49.780]  No.
[01:49.860 --> 01:53.200]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:53.360 --> 01:53.960]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:53.980 --> 01:56.440]  With me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[01:56.560 --> 01:59.420]  This is episode 165.
[01:59.420 --> 02:04.100]  And you know, before you continue your pedantic little argument, let me say,
[02:04.220 --> 02:07.360]  I was thinking about this, and I think it's something that we need to start prefacing going
[02:07.360 --> 02:07.760]  forward.
[02:08.020 --> 02:11.080]  This is a 100% non-AI podcast.
[02:11.300 --> 02:17.580]  We are all humans saying human things written, or in this case, not written by other humans.
[02:19.060 --> 02:22.000]  It really makes me think you did something with AI for this episode.
[02:22.260 --> 02:23.060]  No, no, not at all.
[02:23.060 --> 02:26.200]  I was just reading an article about...
[02:26.900 --> 02:31.600]  They were interviewing James Van Der Beek about he was saying that AI is going to destroy
[02:33.000 --> 02:34.800]  Hollywood and entertainment in general.
[02:34.980 --> 02:38.000]  And I just got to thinking, maybe that's true, maybe it's not, I don't know.
[02:38.420 --> 02:42.440]  But at some point pretty soon, like I don't know if you saw this, the other day,
[02:42.640 --> 02:49.360]  Ron DeSantis released a political ad where they AI'd Trump's voice saying shit that he didn't say.
[02:51.020 --> 02:54.860]  And there's just like no way to know whether it's true, like whether you're listening to
[02:54.860 --> 02:56.460]  somebody that's real or not at this point.
[02:56.760 --> 02:59.820]  So that, and you remember the other day, a couple months ago, when Jack showed us AI
[02:59.820 --> 03:03.760]  Eric saying eat the pencil or Eric, Android the pencil or whatever, I would have bought,
[03:03.980 --> 03:05.000]  I would have bought it in a heartbeat.
[03:05.380 --> 03:11.520]  So my point being here is that I just want people to know as of, first off, as far as
[03:11.520 --> 03:13.100]  I know, every episode up to this point.
[03:13.100 --> 03:15.780]  And then from here on going forward, we're all humans.
[03:15.960 --> 03:17.500]  Well, here's what we have going for us.
[03:17.500 --> 03:22.160]  We could feed machine learning AI every single episode of F***face.
[03:22.720 --> 03:25.900]  And there's no way it could ever know what Andrew's going to do next.
[03:26.540 --> 03:30.800]  I can, can I say, I also don't know what Andrew's going to do next because he just
[03:30.800 --> 03:32.580]  said in our chat, I'm rebooting.
[03:33.240 --> 03:37.220]  Oh, is he rebooting like he's doing an AI joke or he's physically rebooting his computer?
[03:38.540 --> 03:40.020]  Andrew's been weird today, man.
[03:40.080 --> 03:41.740]  We've been talking for a little while before the episode.
[03:41.940 --> 03:42.620]  I can't hear him.
[03:42.660 --> 03:43.200]  Is he speaking?
[03:43.680 --> 03:45.740]  He couldn't hear us before.
[03:45.920 --> 03:46.860]  Then he could.
[03:47.120 --> 03:48.220]  And now he's rebooting.
[03:48.740 --> 03:50.520]  But I haven't heard him say a single word.
[03:50.740 --> 03:51.960]  Well, you weren't here early.
[03:52.300 --> 03:53.500]  Yeah, he was saying words earlier.
[03:53.540 --> 03:53.860]  Don't worry.
[03:53.940 --> 03:55.060]  No, I just mean in the episode.
[03:56.360 --> 03:57.680]  Well, it's because he's rebooting.
[03:57.960 --> 03:59.420]  He can't talk and reboot at the same time.
[03:59.840 --> 04:03.900]  This is, this is the worst episode we've made.
[04:05.460 --> 04:07.960]  Oh, that's, that's a pretty low bar.
[04:09.400 --> 04:13.420]  Gavin, before the episode, Andrew just talked to me out of the blue.
[04:13.860 --> 04:15.880]  Who, by the way, he hasn't talked to me in probably at least a week.
[04:16.140 --> 04:17.080]  Talked to me out of the blue.
[04:17.420 --> 04:18.680]  I texted you yesterday.
[04:18.780 --> 04:19.680]  What are you talking about?
[04:20.060 --> 04:20.880]  Where are you?
[04:20.940 --> 04:22.160]  What is that?
[04:22.840 --> 04:24.540]  Are you inside of a Gerpler?
[04:25.180 --> 04:25.940]  I'm rebooting.
[04:26.180 --> 04:27.540]  Jesus Christ, relax.
[04:27.660 --> 04:29.680]  Andrew's talking into a Gerpler on a string.
[04:29.920 --> 04:31.080]  Geoff, I texted you.
[04:34.420 --> 04:37.240]  This is what we get after Geoff says there's no AI in this episode.
[04:38.180 --> 04:39.440]  This is the sound we have.
[04:40.160 --> 04:41.120]  Well, what did he text you saying?
[04:41.680 --> 04:45.520]  Oh, just like he was being very conspicuous about asking if I thought this was a blindside episode.
[04:45.640 --> 04:47.120]  If it could be a blindside episode.
[04:47.660 --> 04:49.120]  I just gave him the warning.
[04:49.520 --> 04:50.920]  He sounded very blindside-y.
[04:51.060 --> 04:53.600]  And then the more he talked about it, the less I trusted him.
[04:53.680 --> 04:55.020]  And then the more he tried to convince me.
[04:55.220 --> 04:56.520]  And the less I trusted him.
[04:57.020 --> 04:57.960]  I just got out of the lab.
[04:58.060 --> 04:58.960]  I've been in the lab all morning.
[04:59.740 --> 05:00.720]  Oh, there he goes.
[05:02.460 --> 05:05.460]  This, this, I don't even, do we edit it?
[05:05.600 --> 05:07.000]  Like, what is this?
[05:07.560 --> 05:09.860]  What if, here's all right, here's a wild theory.
[05:10.340 --> 05:15.320]  I just declared that f***face is 100% human, non-AI.
[05:17.520 --> 05:20.720]  What if Andrew has been AI this entire time?
[05:21.040 --> 05:24.780]  And we just like, it's like the three laws of robotics and Isaac Asimov books.
[05:25.040 --> 05:29.180]  Like, we just broke one of the, like, he is now can't participate.
[05:29.180 --> 05:32.920]  And I just broke Andrew because he was never human to begin with.
[05:33.600 --> 05:35.180]  Huh, you might need a new disclaimer.
[05:35.180 --> 05:37.540]  You gave him like the Voight-Kampff test.
[05:37.680 --> 05:41.220]  And he just sort of like, he couldn't, he couldn't keep up.
[05:41.700 --> 05:42.620]  Just go hard in it.
[05:43.040 --> 05:44.320]  Wow, this is, you're right.
[05:44.340 --> 05:45.720]  This is exactly like Blade Runner.
[05:46.020 --> 05:46.220]  Yeah.
[05:46.600 --> 05:47.380]  I want to unmute.
[05:48.060 --> 05:48.860]  It's just muted.
[05:49.440 --> 05:50.240]  Can you unmute me?
[05:50.720 --> 05:53.520]  Nick, can you, uh, s***.
[05:54.000 --> 05:54.200]  Yeah.
[05:55.580 --> 05:59.860]  Now, I never considered that one of us was AI the entire time.
[05:59.980 --> 06:00.200]  Yep.
[06:01.800 --> 06:03.700]  Oh, Nick, Nick's muted him somehow.
[06:03.700 --> 06:06.020]  He's asking if you can unmute him.
[06:06.200 --> 06:07.620]  I thought that would be on him though.
[06:07.800 --> 06:08.420]  Yeah, me too.
[06:08.820 --> 06:11.240]  Hey, Nick, can you, uh, brush Andrew's teeth while you're at it?
[06:12.900 --> 06:13.880]  He's not muted.
[06:14.080 --> 06:14.400]  No.
[06:14.940 --> 06:15.960]  What is happening?
[06:16.940 --> 06:17.820]  What is happening?
[06:18.200 --> 06:19.320]  Why are you asking?
[06:19.520 --> 06:20.420]  Oh my God.
[06:22.080 --> 06:23.620]  Andrew wants to know what's happening.
[06:24.460 --> 06:26.960]  I'm, Gracie, it's not always like this.
[06:28.000 --> 06:29.260]  I don't believe that.
[06:31.320 --> 06:32.840]  Something tells me that's a lie.
[06:35.500 --> 06:38.080]  Is your mic working in anything else?
[06:38.240 --> 06:38.720]  He's gone.
[06:40.980 --> 06:41.860]  Reloading Discord.
[06:43.820 --> 06:44.500]  Andrew texted me.
[06:44.700 --> 06:45.480]  So close.
[06:46.240 --> 06:46.660]  That's good.
[06:46.940 --> 06:48.180]  He was just standing and he left again.
[06:48.620 --> 06:49.060]  Oh, he's back.
[06:49.280 --> 06:49.880]  Oh, he's back.
[06:49.900 --> 06:50.500]  He's unmuted.
[06:50.660 --> 06:51.140]  He's unmuted.
[06:53.000 --> 06:53.280]  Andrew?
[06:53.540 --> 06:54.200]  Please talk.
[06:54.740 --> 06:55.720]  I can see me talking.
[06:55.880 --> 06:57.060]  I wonder if the mic fell off the fridge.
[06:57.240 --> 06:58.180]  But I can't hear you.
[06:58.720 --> 06:58.920]  Oh.
[06:59.980 --> 07:00.280]  Oh.
[07:00.940 --> 07:02.320]  That's, we're going into deep lore.
[07:02.320 --> 07:03.060]  This is...
[07:05.260 --> 07:06.960]  That's a real, that's a Hail Mary.
[07:07.360 --> 07:07.600]  Yeah.
[07:07.840 --> 07:08.920]  Come on, connect.
[07:10.100 --> 07:10.960]  Just as...
[07:10.960 --> 07:11.080]  Oh.
[07:13.720 --> 07:14.600]  Am I?
[07:15.080 --> 07:15.280]  Yeah.
[07:15.520 --> 07:15.700]  Yeah.
[07:15.840 --> 07:16.940]  Hey, I was gone.
[07:17.220 --> 07:18.860]  Hey, like, like he was never gone.
[07:19.500 --> 07:21.220]  Minute 20 of my recording.
[07:21.580 --> 07:21.780]  Yep.
[07:22.440 --> 07:26.160]  Well, you, if you guys were here a little bit earlier, none of that would have happened.
[07:27.060 --> 07:30.000]  You were here five minutes, at least five minutes early.
[07:30.100 --> 07:31.140]  Would you say, Nick?
[07:31.640 --> 07:33.160]  I looked at five minutes.
[07:33.320 --> 07:35.620]  I looked at, uh, what time was it?
[07:36.060 --> 07:36.420]  1255.
[07:37.240 --> 07:38.220]  No one was here.
[07:38.860 --> 07:41.680]  I swapped to a different tab to get my notes ready.
[07:42.180 --> 07:43.640]  And then when I came back, everyone was here.
[07:43.700 --> 07:44.140]  I didn't see.
[07:44.220 --> 07:44.740]  I missed it.
[07:44.820 --> 07:46.580]  But I was like, oh, typically people are here by now.
[07:46.680 --> 07:48.680]  Yeah, I can't believe we did that to you.
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.720]  Are you saying you need us all to be five minutes early?
[07:51.880 --> 07:53.400]  Otherwise you won't function correctly.
[07:53.920 --> 07:55.160]  No, so what happened was...
[07:55.160 --> 07:57.120]  Like, if I don't arrive five minutes early to the restaurant,
[07:57.220 --> 07:59.140]  you'll just shit your pants the second I arrive and leave.
[07:59.140 --> 08:02.340]  What he's saying is we need to be earlier than five minutes.
[08:02.560 --> 08:03.740]  No, typically it's fine.
[08:04.440 --> 08:07.560]  What happened was I went into my settings on my computer,
[08:07.760 --> 08:10.580]  and it said, you cannot access your audio settings.
[08:10.700 --> 08:14.880]  I thought, that's not good because I'm defaulting to my speakers.
[08:15.360 --> 08:19.020]  But maybe in Discord, I can set it for my headphones.
[08:19.520 --> 08:21.220]  So I went into Discord, went to the audio settings.
[08:21.360 --> 08:22.280]  It said, all good.
[08:22.480 --> 08:24.300]  Your audio is being fed to your headphones.
[08:24.860 --> 08:27.880]  Then that was clearly not the case when I went back to the tab
[08:27.880 --> 08:31.600]  and discovered that there were four people in here post 1255.
[08:32.460 --> 08:35.240]  And so I couldn't change it because I couldn't change my audio output.
[08:35.340 --> 08:37.380]  And you guys are going through my computer speakers.
[08:37.520 --> 08:40.820]  Yeah, the chances of you actually recording the correct mic at this point
[08:40.820 --> 08:42.320]  is pretty slim, I think.
[08:42.780 --> 08:45.260]  No, I'm definitely, I'm all good. I'm looking at it in Audacity.
[08:45.380 --> 08:47.960]  I got the Scarlet Solo. Everything's all set up. We're all fine.
[08:48.300 --> 08:50.240]  It was just that audio issue. We worked through it.
[08:50.680 --> 08:52.120]  Now we're here. How's everyone doing?
[08:52.520 --> 08:55.580]  Great. Gavin's been in the lab. Please tell me about being in the lab.
[08:55.580 --> 08:58.120]  I need to know. I've been like itching for like 20 minutes.
[08:58.300 --> 08:59.480]  Please tell me about being in the lab.
[08:59.840 --> 09:00.920]  We also went to Vegas.
[09:01.180 --> 09:02.540]  Oh my god. You did go to Vegas.
[09:03.100 --> 09:05.920]  Yeah, I'm so sad I missed that. It was the big bachelor part.
[09:06.020 --> 09:07.780]  Tell me about Vegas. What happened to Vegas?
[09:08.600 --> 09:10.800]  I don't know. I kind of want to know what's going on in the lab first.
[09:10.900 --> 09:11.900]  Tell me about the lab!
[09:12.080 --> 09:12.340]  Okay.
[09:12.980 --> 09:14.520]  Okay, I guess we're doing the lab first.
[09:15.000 --> 09:15.500]  Yeah, okay.
[09:15.880 --> 09:17.100]  Wait, is the episode starting now?
[09:18.200 --> 09:19.660]  It started a little bit ago.
[09:20.100 --> 09:21.420]  How far are we into this episode?
[09:21.420 --> 09:22.980]  Tell us about the fucking lab, dude!
[09:23.680 --> 09:27.940]  Sorry, man. Okay, so this is a Unifarm creation from...
[09:32.110 --> 09:32.830]  I'm gonna...
[09:32.830 --> 09:33.450]  I was in the lab too.
[09:33.450 --> 09:35.250]  You had 20 minutes of Andrew Fump!
[09:35.530 --> 09:37.750]  From the mind of WhoopScoop!
[09:37.830 --> 09:39.690]  This is the official WhoopScoop logo.
[09:40.190 --> 09:41.150]  Oh yeah.
[09:41.550 --> 09:43.850]  And what we're working on today, everyone, is...
[09:43.850 --> 09:45.370]  Oh, my favorites folder.
[09:46.170 --> 09:47.470]  I thought you built that in the lab.
[09:47.530 --> 09:48.830]  I thought that was the creation.
[09:48.990 --> 09:50.150]  No, that would have been cooler.
[09:50.250 --> 09:51.630]  That was just on a wall somewhere.
[09:51.670 --> 09:52.370]  That was in Vegas.
[09:52.870 --> 09:53.150]  Yeah.
[09:55.450 --> 10:00.850]  So, the plan was to create a glove that acts like a hand warmer.
[10:01.330 --> 10:03.990]  So I can put my hand in the glove, activate it,
[10:04.070 --> 10:07.110]  and suddenly I've got a hot hand to carve through ice cream.
[10:07.690 --> 10:07.830]  Yeah.
[10:07.890 --> 10:10.710]  So I thought it's as simple as getting a bunch of, you know,
[10:10.770 --> 10:15.210]  those liquid hand warmers and stuffing all of the liquid in a glove.
[10:15.690 --> 10:16.050]  Wrong!
[10:16.390 --> 10:19.950]  It immediately oxidizes with the air and solidifies.
[10:21.770 --> 10:22.670]  Oh, no!
[10:23.470 --> 10:28.610]  So I ended up looking like I had a bunch of chopped pineapple in a food glove.
[10:31.190 --> 10:32.390]  But don't worry.
[10:33.110 --> 10:33.950]  But don't worry.
[10:34.410 --> 10:37.870]  Because you could boil that shit.
[10:38.590 --> 10:42.230]  And I did it on a saucepan outside so I didn't gas my...
[10:42.230 --> 10:43.750]  By the way, I think I've poisoned myself.
[10:44.190 --> 10:45.150]  Anyway, moving on.
[10:45.370 --> 10:51.390]  I managed to reset the entire hand warmer back into its liquid form.
[10:51.530 --> 10:52.070]  And here it is.
[10:52.070 --> 10:54.990]  And you can see I've left in a little metal tab that you're supposed to squeeze
[10:55.510 --> 10:57.270]  to set it off being hot again.
[10:58.370 --> 10:59.350]  Now, slight problem.
[10:59.890 --> 11:04.290]  Well, I should say next, I wanted to put the glove I was going to wear inside that.
[11:04.510 --> 11:05.930]  But I couldn't figure out how to do that
[11:05.930 --> 11:08.990]  because it was too hot to put my actual hand in currently.
[11:09.470 --> 11:13.090]  So I created a dummy hand mold,
[11:13.330 --> 11:15.910]  which I made out of a glove full of water.
[11:16.050 --> 11:17.650]  So that's standing in for my hand.
[11:18.850 --> 11:21.270]  Didn't realize, as you can see in that picture,
[11:21.270 --> 11:24.150]  there's some white ooze now coming out of the other one.
[11:24.650 --> 11:26.410]  And it's leaking.
[11:26.930 --> 11:27.330]  It's leaking.
[11:27.870 --> 11:30.830]  It left a big stain on the couch I put it on.
[11:35.560 --> 11:37.100]  So I quickly had to deal with it.
[11:37.140 --> 11:37.840]  I opened it up.
[11:37.940 --> 11:40.980]  I was trying to stuff the water glove up the hand warmer glove.
[11:41.620 --> 11:43.940]  It looks like a hungry duck.
[11:45.600 --> 11:47.220]  It looks like a rabid duck.
[11:47.320 --> 11:48.400]  It's foaming at the mouth.
[11:49.720 --> 11:51.540]  The thumb, by the way, is stuck underneath.
[11:51.800 --> 11:53.580]  I couldn't get access to the thumb.
[11:53.600 --> 11:57.460]  I was hoping that when I stuffed the water glove in the warm glove,
[11:57.780 --> 11:59.720]  everything would be fine and go back to normal.
[11:59.780 --> 12:03.400]  Anyway, so all the water in the heat warmer juice spilled all over the place.
[12:03.580 --> 12:08.660]  And I ended up with a glove with a crumpled up other glove in the top of it.
[12:09.100 --> 12:14.340]  While all the fingers are slowly turning back into the hard material.
[12:15.200 --> 12:16.820]  It's all going wrong.
[12:17.340 --> 12:20.260]  And this is the stain that it left on my patio.
[12:20.960 --> 12:26.300]  So all in all, this ended about 25 minutes ago, by the way.
[12:26.380 --> 12:27.820]  I burnt the shit out of myself.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.300]  I inhaled a lot of fumes.
[12:31.200 --> 12:34.520]  And hopefully I lost the double recording we have today.
[12:34.620 --> 12:37.760]  So I'd say incredibly unsuccessful day in the lab.
[12:38.120 --> 12:40.540]  But I think I've proved the concept.
[12:40.700 --> 12:46.340]  I just need to pour the liquid very quickly or sort of grind up the hard stuff
[12:46.340 --> 12:50.020]  and get the gloves settled before I go to the boil phase.
[12:50.020 --> 12:51.320]  I think I can do that.
[12:51.820 --> 12:56.120]  Do you do you think you maybe you need a tougher glove?
[12:56.360 --> 12:56.960]  It's possible.
[12:57.280 --> 13:01.520]  You remember the gloves you used to use to wash dishes back when you lived with me?
[13:01.940 --> 13:04.040]  Yeah, those were like a heavier duty glove.
[13:04.380 --> 13:05.120]  Like some marigolds.
[13:05.240 --> 13:06.240]  Well, I wanted to see through them.
[13:06.300 --> 13:07.060]  I thought that'd be cool.
[13:07.160 --> 13:09.180]  But yeah, that's true for sure.
[13:09.280 --> 13:09.400]  Yeah.
[13:09.680 --> 13:09.940]  Yeah.
[13:10.200 --> 13:11.080]  Adds to the cosmetic.
[13:11.120 --> 13:12.740]  So what is the actual goal here?
[13:12.780 --> 13:13.760]  What is the end product?
[13:14.540 --> 13:17.840]  To be able to put my hand into the ice cream gloves.
[13:18.380 --> 13:18.760]  Okay.
[13:18.760 --> 13:25.440]  And activate the whoop scoop so that I can claw ice cream out of the tub with my hand into a bowl.
[13:25.980 --> 13:26.380]  Okay.
[13:26.840 --> 13:28.700]  And then I boil the glove afterwards.
[13:30.220 --> 13:31.600]  I think that's a brilliant idea.
[13:32.040 --> 13:32.380]  Yeah.
[13:32.840 --> 13:34.940]  I mean, it is an idea for sure.
[13:35.360 --> 13:35.620]  Right.
[13:35.780 --> 13:38.240]  Have you considered a spoon for the ice cream?
[13:38.440 --> 13:39.640]  We've talked about this, dude.
[13:39.780 --> 13:41.720]  Ice cream sometimes is too cold for spoons.
[13:41.840 --> 13:43.820]  And we were talking about how we wanted a heated spoon.
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.800]  And then Gavin came up with the idea for the gloves.
[13:46.060 --> 13:46.860]  That's fair.
[13:47.080 --> 13:47.640]  That's fair.
[13:47.640 --> 13:50.920]  And it was following along the lines of the fruit gloves,
[13:51.100 --> 13:52.100]  which I don't think we ever got.
[13:52.360 --> 13:55.240]  But it inspired me to go forward with ice cream gloves.
[13:55.680 --> 13:57.960]  You know, I had a minor breakthrough in the fruit gloves the other day.
[13:58.400 --> 13:58.880]  Did you?
[13:59.640 --> 14:02.040]  Yeah, I need to get back to it because I saw something that inspired me.
[14:03.300 --> 14:03.860]  Oh, okay.
[14:03.880 --> 14:04.740]  So you don't want to say it now.
[14:04.840 --> 14:05.400]  This is lab work.
[14:05.400 --> 14:05.940]  No, no, no.
[14:05.980 --> 14:06.580]  I don't want to ruin it.
[14:06.640 --> 14:08.160]  Yeah, let me get into the lab work on it.
[14:08.240 --> 14:09.480]  But I'll also be honest with you.
[14:09.620 --> 14:12.040]  I'm a little inspired by what Gavin's going through right now.
[14:12.280 --> 14:13.860]  Like, he's in the frustrating part of it.
[14:13.980 --> 14:16.600]  But it's like, magic is happening in front of our eyes.
[14:17.120 --> 14:19.400]  He is learning how not to make them.
[14:19.720 --> 14:22.440]  We've now seen several attempts of how not to do it.
[14:22.500 --> 14:23.340]  You're narrowing it down.
[14:23.760 --> 14:24.760]  I'm learning.
[14:24.940 --> 14:26.820]  I've learned a lot in the last hour.
[14:28.020 --> 14:31.360]  You can't make an omelet without breaking a few gloves.
[14:31.640 --> 14:32.060]  We know that.
[14:32.400 --> 14:32.560]  Yeah.
[14:32.680 --> 14:32.800]  Yeah.
[14:32.980 --> 14:34.160]  Or a couch or the patio.
[14:35.200 --> 14:36.460]  Are you in trouble with magnets?
[14:36.640 --> 14:36.920]  Do they yell at you?
[14:37.800 --> 14:40.540]  Well, I'm pretty sure I can just boil it back to liquid.
[14:40.540 --> 14:41.780]  I don't know how to do it.
[14:46.020 --> 14:49.560]  You know, I'll let her know later, depending on how the cleanup goes.
[14:50.780 --> 14:53.180]  She can't be mad at what she doesn't see, right?
[14:54.660 --> 14:56.740]  Just walk her around those parts of the house.
[14:59.120 --> 15:02.840]  That's like when I was a kid, I gave myself a rat tail one time.
[15:03.300 --> 15:05.760]  And my mom was not cool with me having one.
[15:05.780 --> 15:08.360]  But this is like the early 80s, so I needed to have one.
[15:08.520 --> 15:10.240]  Or otherwise, I just couldn't go to school.
[15:11.060 --> 15:12.960]  And so, and it's a fucking dude.
[15:13.060 --> 15:16.540]  I was sitting in my bedroom one night and I was watching Knight Rider.
[15:17.100 --> 15:20.640]  And fucking David Hasselhoff was so cool.
[15:21.040 --> 15:22.660]  He was such a fucking badass.
[15:22.860 --> 15:24.640]  And he took no shit from nobody.
[15:24.780 --> 15:27.680]  And during a commercial break, I fucking psyched myself up.
[15:27.720 --> 15:30.040]  And I went into the bathroom and I gave myself a rat tail.
[15:30.200 --> 15:32.500]  And then I immediately did not feel like a badass.
[15:32.620 --> 15:33.900]  I felt like I was going to get in trouble.
[15:34.240 --> 15:35.740]  And so I just didn't turn.
[15:35.740 --> 15:39.480]  I just didn't turn my back to my mom for four days before she caught me.
[15:40.760 --> 15:42.120]  She caught me on a Thursday.
[15:42.580 --> 15:43.780]  I did it on a Sunday.
[15:45.180 --> 15:46.580]  Anyway, it worked for me.
[15:46.800 --> 15:47.800]  It'll probably work for you and Meg.
[15:47.880 --> 15:50.520]  Just walk her, just like walk her around the other side of the house or whatever.
[15:50.840 --> 15:51.020]  Yeah.
[15:51.320 --> 15:53.060]  What was the endgame on the rat tail?
[15:53.460 --> 15:54.420]  Did she ever find out?
[15:54.760 --> 15:55.540]  Yeah, she caught me.
[15:55.640 --> 15:58.240]  And I was, I actually, I don't know why I remember this so well.
[15:58.420 --> 16:01.040]  I was going into our pantry.
[16:01.300 --> 16:02.520]  Or not pantry, it was like a cabinet.
[16:02.520 --> 16:06.320]  Going into our pantry because we had these Teddy Grahams that were Return of the Jedi,
[16:06.800 --> 16:08.560]  like Teddy Grahams, that had just come out.
[16:08.600 --> 16:10.060]  And they were like little Ewok things.
[16:10.340 --> 16:11.160]  And I wanted some.
[16:11.280 --> 16:13.780]  And I was so fucking jazzed about them, because we had just gotten them,
[16:13.900 --> 16:15.000]  that I turned around.
[16:15.180 --> 16:16.300]  And my mom goes, what is that?
[16:16.360 --> 16:17.700]  And I was like, ah, fuck!
[16:17.840 --> 16:20.140]  I didn't say fuck, because I'd have a triple in trouble.
[16:20.520 --> 16:21.580]  But I was like, ah!
[16:21.800 --> 16:24.760]  And then she was impressed that I got away with it for as long as I did.
[16:24.820 --> 16:25.720]  I think she made me cut it.
[16:26.060 --> 16:27.040]  But I didn't get in trouble.
[16:27.040 --> 16:33.460]  Uh, what does it say about me that my mom gave us rat tails in the early days?
[16:34.260 --> 16:35.400]  It just checks out.
[16:35.540 --> 16:36.120]  You're the rat cat.
[16:36.580 --> 16:38.380]  I think it says everything about you.
[16:38.380 --> 16:38.980]  You've been living that lifestyle.
[16:39.340 --> 16:42.500]  I just really... that's some white trash stuff, man.
[16:43.440 --> 16:47.860]  I feel like your mom would have just tried to make you look like the kid in the Crossfire commercial.
[16:48.540 --> 16:49.900]  That would have been awesome.
[16:50.320 --> 16:52.860]  I would have loved to have been the kid in the Crossfire commercial.
[16:53.180 --> 16:54.720]  Oh man, that's awesome.
[16:55.300 --> 16:56.480]  Anyone else been in the lab this week?
[16:57.860 --> 16:58.760]  I've been in the lab.
[16:58.900 --> 16:59.920]  Should I do my lab stuff now?
[16:59.980 --> 17:00.680]  I want to hear about Vegas.
[17:01.880 --> 17:04.560]  Hell... well, this is apparently the lab episode.
[17:04.700 --> 17:05.280]  Let's get into the lab.
[17:06.080 --> 17:07.580]  Do you want to get into the lab stuff?
[17:08.380 --> 17:09.200]  I think so.
[17:09.980 --> 17:10.700]  Oh, okay.
[17:11.020 --> 17:13.060]  Well, first of all, we can't go lab, Vegas, lab.
[17:13.140 --> 17:14.000]  We won't finish the episode.
[17:14.180 --> 17:15.620]  We gotta, yeah, let's go lab, lab, Vegas.
[17:15.780 --> 17:16.120]  We gotta do.
[17:16.360 --> 17:18.300]  Second of all, how far into this episode are we?
[17:18.560 --> 17:19.440]  What minute marker are we?
[17:19.460 --> 17:20.320]  I'm very disoriented.
[17:20.660 --> 17:22.680]  Probably right around 10, I would think.
[17:22.700 --> 17:24.240]  I think we're probably closer to 15.
[17:25.060 --> 17:25.420]  15?
[17:25.800 --> 17:26.080]  Okay.
[17:26.080 --> 17:27.860]  We're 15 minutes in.
[17:28.260 --> 17:29.600]  So I went into the lab.
[17:30.100 --> 17:34.000]  Gavin and I shared each other little lab teas earlier, what we're doing.
[17:34.380 --> 17:37.280]  I've wanted to do this for a while.
[17:37.680 --> 17:40.440]  Okay, this has been in lab development for a long time.
[17:40.560 --> 17:42.520]  R&D, as they say.
[17:42.980 --> 17:46.760]  I'm going to show you guys something and you're going to tell me what you see.
[17:46.960 --> 17:47.280]  Okay?
[17:47.800 --> 17:49.780]  Putting a photo in right now.
[17:50.380 --> 17:51.380]  What do you guys see?
[17:52.160 --> 17:53.400]  What are you looking at here?
[17:53.500 --> 17:54.240]  Use your eyes.
[17:55.040 --> 17:55.540]  Use your soul.
[17:55.540 --> 17:56.140]  What do you see?
[17:56.580 --> 17:57.420]  It's pool noodles.
[17:57.880 --> 17:58.580]  Pool noodles.
[17:58.680 --> 17:59.600]  You see pool noodles?
[18:00.960 --> 18:02.040]  What do you see, Geoff?
[18:02.500 --> 18:04.940]  I see rake sleeves.
[18:05.620 --> 18:06.300]  Rake sleeves?
[18:06.700 --> 18:11.100]  Yeah, I saw a TikTok where this dude sprayed WD-40 in those things and then you put it on your rake
[18:11.100 --> 18:13.080]  and then it's more comfortable to rake with.
[18:14.020 --> 18:18.440]  Oh, I see like a supersized fries.
[18:20.220 --> 18:21.020]  Supersized fries?
[18:21.620 --> 18:22.180]  Oh, I see.
[18:22.240 --> 18:22.840]  I see what you're saying.
[18:22.900 --> 18:23.740]  Okay, you're getting artistic.
[18:23.960 --> 18:24.780]  You're doing some interpretation.
[18:24.780 --> 18:26.460]  Okay, I need to relay in.
[18:26.460 --> 18:27.500]  It's not the right direction.
[18:27.900 --> 18:28.860]  It's not the right direction.
[18:29.020 --> 18:29.040]  Oh shit!
[18:29.040 --> 18:29.840]  Is it sleep spaghetti?
[18:31.120 --> 18:32.880]  It's sleep spaghetti.
[18:33.180 --> 18:34.060]  That's right, Geoff.
[18:34.220 --> 18:34.320]  Oh my god!
[18:34.520 --> 18:35.820]  You've been sleeping on it.
[18:36.020 --> 18:36.920]  Sleep spaghetti.
[18:37.100 --> 18:41.680]  I've been waiting for the summer so the dollar store could get some noodles in because I needed
[18:41.680 --> 18:44.020]  a base thing and they're expensive otherwise.
[18:44.240 --> 18:45.080]  They cost a lot of money.
[18:45.480 --> 18:45.680]  Yeah.
[18:46.160 --> 18:47.100]  Sleep spaghetti.
[18:47.560 --> 18:48.420]  We have the prototype.
[18:48.700 --> 18:49.360]  That's the base.
[18:49.440 --> 18:52.040]  We got the pool noodles there as needed.
[18:52.040 --> 18:55.720]  It became a problem of fabric is expensive as well.
[18:55.960 --> 18:57.380]  What do you use for fabric?
[18:57.440 --> 18:59.360]  How would you solve this?
[18:59.440 --> 19:01.120]  What is your solution for this problem?
[19:01.480 --> 19:02.220]  Because we have the noodles.
[19:03.140 --> 19:03.740]  What would you do?
[19:03.860 --> 19:05.060]  I'll tell you what I did.
[19:05.380 --> 19:06.020]  I'll show you right now.
[19:06.140 --> 19:06.800]  Put a photo of it.
[19:07.180 --> 19:10.100]  Put in sleep fucking spaghetti.
[19:10.440 --> 19:10.600]  Okay?
[19:11.140 --> 19:12.360]  Got some socks.
[19:12.760 --> 19:13.740]  Got some cheap...
[19:14.420 --> 19:16.360]  Got some cheap...
[19:18.920 --> 19:19.940]  I got some...
[19:20.500 --> 19:22.820]  There's a bunch of heels all the way up.
[19:23.180 --> 19:23.600]  Yeah.
[19:23.840 --> 19:25.900]  I bought some socks.
[19:26.960 --> 19:31.820]  And you chop the top off the sock and then you slide it down.
[19:31.940 --> 19:33.180]  It covers that sleep spaghetti.
[19:33.640 --> 19:36.020]  You get the sleep spaghetti going nice and good.
[19:36.480 --> 19:36.820]  Okay?
[19:38.200 --> 19:39.820]  This is a hard day's work.
[19:40.260 --> 19:40.740]  Okay?
[19:41.140 --> 19:42.100]  For research and development.
[19:42.540 --> 19:43.540]  This is the bed.
[19:43.860 --> 19:45.180]  All nice and cozy.
[19:45.580 --> 19:46.400]  You get them laid out.
[19:46.520 --> 19:47.040]  Oh my god.
[19:47.040 --> 19:49.420]  This is an idea we've been talking about for a long time.
[19:49.420 --> 19:53.260]  I built sleep spaghetti and I'm ready for your questions.
[19:55.360 --> 19:56.340]  Let me start.
[19:56.420 --> 19:57.200]  Did I sleep well?
[19:57.360 --> 19:57.700]  No.
[19:58.060 --> 19:58.460]  Continue.
[19:58.860 --> 19:59.600]  Other questions.
[20:05.020 --> 20:07.020]  I didn't come up with it.
[20:07.080 --> 20:08.600]  I just wanted to finalize it.
[20:09.080 --> 20:09.940]  I saw it.
[20:11.940 --> 20:16.020]  Why is it so much more horrific than it sounded originally?
[20:16.020 --> 20:19.460]  Well, I mean, a number of reasons.
[20:19.900 --> 20:22.580]  He has sleep uncooked spaghetti.
[20:22.820 --> 20:25.620]  This is the noodle before it's wet.
[20:26.100 --> 20:28.980]  You're just sleeping on fried noodles.
[20:29.500 --> 20:32.400]  Sleep spaghetti is a thing you can like sink into.
[20:32.720 --> 20:33.160]  Andrew.
[20:34.220 --> 20:34.860]  Andrew.
[20:35.980 --> 20:36.280]  Andrew.
[20:37.320 --> 20:38.480]  This is also brilliant.
[20:38.800 --> 20:41.020]  It's also watching magic happen in front of us.
[20:41.120 --> 20:44.020]  Right now, your spaghetti is too al dente.
[20:46.020 --> 20:47.040]  You need to cook it.
[20:47.140 --> 20:50.540]  It needs to go back in the pot for like another 10 minutes.
[20:51.120 --> 20:53.000]  That was your vision was a more...
[20:53.000 --> 20:54.760]  I feel like a firm noodle.
[20:55.340 --> 20:56.460]  I like my noodles firm.
[20:57.240 --> 21:00.880]  But so surely you're slipping immediately through those.
[21:01.780 --> 21:02.580]  Well, okay.
[21:02.720 --> 21:06.580]  So what you do is you push them to the side.
[21:06.760 --> 21:08.140]  Then you lay down.
[21:08.480 --> 21:13.440]  Then you feel like a building has fallen on top of you and you don't move.
[21:14.860 --> 21:18.500]  That's the first phase of comfort with the sleep spaghetti.
[21:19.920 --> 21:22.820]  No matter how you lay, it's sort of a problem.
[21:23.020 --> 21:25.860]  If you lay on your back, you feel like you're in Gulliver's Travels.
[21:26.060 --> 21:29.480]  You just feel like you're locked in and you're being held down.
[21:29.640 --> 21:35.180]  If you lay on your side, you feel like a skate ramp is being built off of you.
[21:35.560 --> 21:36.880]  It's a real problem.
[21:37.200 --> 21:41.480]  Other issues that I did not foresee with the sleep spaghetti setup.
[21:42.160 --> 21:44.560]  You can very easily, which I did,
[21:44.680 --> 21:49.680]  knock everything off of your end table trying to adjust a piece of sleep spaghetti
[21:49.680 --> 21:54.980]  because it is a very solid, long piece of foam, I guess.
[21:55.060 --> 21:59.680]  I'm not exactly sure what the material is, but it's solid and it's not comfy.
[22:00.880 --> 22:05.580]  Can you just imagine if we started episode one with that couple of sentences?
[22:05.920 --> 22:07.160]  How insane that would sound.
[22:08.740 --> 22:09.640]  How what would sound?
[22:10.360 --> 22:14.260]  Just it's not that this is so deep into the lore of nothing.
[22:15.960 --> 22:16.760]  Good lord.
[22:17.460 --> 22:20.500]  I'm in the pillows for some reason just look disgusting.
[22:20.800 --> 22:23.280]  Why is everything about that so unappealing?
[22:24.060 --> 22:24.440]  What do you mean?
[22:24.600 --> 22:25.420]  It's just a pile of pillows.
[22:25.720 --> 22:29.460]  Yeah, but that's sort of like off-white and they're getting like progressively darker.
[22:29.780 --> 22:30.140]  You know what?
[22:30.300 --> 22:30.660]  All right.
[22:30.720 --> 22:31.900]  Get him Gavin, get him.
[22:31.940 --> 22:32.800]  No, no, no.
[22:33.120 --> 22:34.720]  Calm down, rabid duck guy.
[22:34.900 --> 22:35.840]  Okay, I don't want to hear it.
[22:35.900 --> 22:37.720]  You got a fucking rabid duck on your couch.
[22:37.920 --> 22:38.440]  It's true.
[22:38.440 --> 22:41.480]  Fucking mangoes dried up on your patio.
[22:41.660 --> 22:44.540]  I don't want to hear this nonsense about pillow mountain.
[22:44.780 --> 22:45.080]  Okay.
[22:45.280 --> 22:48.580]  I think he's just got some that are cream colored and some that are white.
[22:48.640 --> 22:49.140]  I don't know.
[22:49.340 --> 22:49.980]  You got different colors.
[22:50.120 --> 22:51.100]  You got different shades.
[22:51.440 --> 22:51.680]  Okay.
[22:51.860 --> 22:52.900]  Got all sorts of options.
[22:53.300 --> 22:59.360]  I think it looks, I think the pillows look weird because the sleep spaghetti is so unsettling
[22:59.360 --> 23:04.000]  to look at that everything else just makes you question what we're doing here.
[23:04.140 --> 23:04.340]  Yeah.
[23:04.820 --> 23:06.980]  It's, oh, it's rough stuff, man.
[23:07.020 --> 23:08.180]  I don't know about this.
[23:08.180 --> 23:12.620]  So, yeah, they really dry your eyes to the pillow.
[23:13.960 --> 23:19.640]  So I would say not wanting to throw, because I do think the pasta is too al dente, right?
[23:20.420 --> 23:23.020]  But I think not wanting to start from scratch, right?
[23:23.080 --> 23:24.580]  And to take what you've already built.
[23:24.920 --> 23:31.740]  First of all, I think maybe the next step would be to take the noodles and cut them
[23:31.740 --> 23:37.320]  maybe through four times per noodle and then stack them back in.
[23:37.380 --> 23:41.180]  So there's more flexibility with them so that you can manipulate them a little bit better.
[23:41.260 --> 23:41.780]  You see what I'm saying?
[23:41.940 --> 23:44.700]  They're not going to be any softer, but they'll be more formable.
[23:44.900 --> 23:47.000]  So you separate them within the sock, you mean?
[23:47.140 --> 23:51.520]  Yeah, like separate them in the sock, but then have the socks bind them together.
[23:51.840 --> 23:52.000]  Yeah.
[23:52.080 --> 23:54.000]  So that way it acts more like...
[23:54.000 --> 23:54.720]  I got it.
[23:54.840 --> 23:56.380]  So you're creating like joints.
[23:56.440 --> 23:58.560]  You're creating spaghetti elbows.
[23:58.940 --> 23:59.040]  Yeah.
[23:59.040 --> 24:02.200]  Maybe you could make use of the heels if they're in chunks as well.
[24:03.940 --> 24:05.820]  How many socks did you ruin?
[24:06.300 --> 24:07.840]  Well, no, we're going to get to that.
[24:07.920 --> 24:11.780]  OK, I didn't ruin any socks.
[24:12.100 --> 24:13.360]  OK, this is really simple.
[24:13.540 --> 24:16.240]  This is I'm glad you brought this up because we have several innovations.
[24:16.700 --> 24:19.440]  OK, so this is look at this pants.
[24:20.360 --> 24:21.380]  OK, pants.
[24:21.440 --> 24:23.300]  That's a pair of pants I just posted a photo of.
[24:23.360 --> 24:24.260]  That's a pair of pants.
[24:24.400 --> 24:24.540]  Yeah.
[24:24.620 --> 24:24.800]  Yeah.
[24:25.000 --> 24:25.740]  Pair of shorts.
[24:26.160 --> 24:27.740]  That's a pair of shorts I just sent a photo of.
[24:27.760 --> 24:28.040]  OK.
[24:28.040 --> 24:28.800]  Socks.
[24:29.240 --> 24:29.920]  OK.
[24:30.640 --> 24:30.820]  Yeah.
[24:31.500 --> 24:32.080]  Shocks.
[24:32.500 --> 24:33.280]  Look at that.
[24:34.120 --> 24:35.900]  Toe-less socks.
[24:36.160 --> 24:41.960]  I realized I hate pants because I feel confined with my legs.
[24:42.480 --> 24:48.580]  So by cutting the toes off of the sock, my toes now have a freedom,
[24:48.960 --> 24:53.160]  which makes me a sock guy, not a sock guy, a shocks guy.
[24:53.460 --> 24:54.840]  I would wear these.
[24:55.000 --> 24:55.960]  I would enjoy these.
[24:56.020 --> 24:57.380]  I'm going to experiment with these.
[24:57.380 --> 24:59.020]  I think it's two for one.
[24:59.180 --> 25:01.380]  So it's not that I ruined socks.
[25:01.460 --> 25:05.640]  I actually made shocks, which is, in my opinion, a superior product.
[25:05.840 --> 25:07.260]  And that's shorts, socks.
[25:07.600 --> 25:08.860]  Short socks, shocks.
[25:09.520 --> 25:12.520]  Do you have any examples of people wearing shocks?
[25:13.380 --> 25:15.000]  No, I do not.
[25:15.260 --> 25:18.120]  I have not put them on because it felt weird to send a foot pick.
[25:18.480 --> 25:19.900]  That goes behind the paywall.
[25:20.240 --> 25:24.720]  Maybe if there's a first situation later, we can experiment with that idea.
[25:25.340 --> 25:26.280]  So it's more of a hand.
[25:26.280 --> 25:28.680]  It can also be fingerless gloves, as I'm displaying.
[25:29.020 --> 25:31.300]  Do you think that they'd slip around, though?
[25:31.640 --> 25:32.180]  Slip around?
[25:32.780 --> 25:34.460]  Yeah, like they wouldn't stay in place.
[25:34.900 --> 25:36.360]  They're snug, aren't they?
[25:36.680 --> 25:38.620]  When you pull a sock up, isn't it snug?
[25:38.920 --> 25:40.200]  Yeah, they're pretty snug.
[25:40.640 --> 25:41.840]  There's like a high sock.
[25:42.240 --> 25:44.040]  I feel like the heel would really grip.
[25:44.980 --> 25:45.340]  I don't know.
[25:45.420 --> 25:47.280]  I guess you need the right shoe.
[25:50.180 --> 25:52.340]  Oh, for God's sake, Garrett.
[25:52.420 --> 25:53.220]  I'm even thinking about doubling down.
[25:53.680 --> 25:53.740]  Idiot.
[25:55.040 --> 25:55.500]  Kiddiot.
[25:55.500 --> 25:58.000]  Toe-less shoes is an interesting idea.
[25:58.440 --> 25:58.920]  Hideous.
[25:59.060 --> 26:02.420]  That being said, he's got some form of shock there.
[26:02.700 --> 26:04.200]  I sent a funny picture.
[26:04.460 --> 26:05.920]  That was me being funny.
[26:06.280 --> 26:08.380]  But just so you know, it is a thing.
[26:09.120 --> 26:09.320]  Yeah.
[26:10.400 --> 26:11.040]  That's great.
[26:11.460 --> 26:13.160]  They're called Ope Toes.
[26:13.280 --> 26:15.020]  O-P-E-T-O-Z.
[26:15.300 --> 26:17.100]  I don't want to promote them, but that is what...
[26:17.100 --> 26:17.620]  They are real.
[26:18.280 --> 26:23.240]  So for your shocks, you can get Ope Toes.
[26:23.680 --> 26:24.160]  Shoes?
[26:24.720 --> 26:24.940]  What?
[26:27.180 --> 26:30.740]  Yeah, I guess it's just shoes.
[26:30.900 --> 26:32.260]  I guess I could just get shoes.
[26:33.640 --> 26:35.300]  But maybe an extra S.
[26:35.460 --> 26:35.820]  Shoes.
[26:37.380 --> 26:38.980]  Differentiate, because it is kind of confusing.
[26:40.400 --> 26:41.200]  I'll wear them.
[26:41.400 --> 26:41.480]  Oh, God.
[26:42.340 --> 26:42.880]  I'll wear them.
[26:42.940 --> 26:43.360]  I'll test that.
[26:43.440 --> 26:48.000]  I will say, before we venture too far past Sleep Spaghetti, on the positive side,
[26:48.720 --> 26:52.240]  I have never felt more prepared for a flood while sleeping.
[26:55.080 --> 26:59.240]  It's never crossed my mind, but I was in bed, I was laying, I was wrapped around it,
[26:59.520 --> 27:00.440]  and I thought, you know what?
[27:00.500 --> 27:03.200]  If a flood occurred, I feel very ready.
[27:03.500 --> 27:05.240]  I think you'd be the last person to find out.
[27:05.520 --> 27:06.360]  I probably would.
[27:06.820 --> 27:08.640]  You wouldn't find out until your nose hit the ceiling.
[27:09.240 --> 27:13.120]  I wouldn't find out until my AirPods fell out of my ears and the rain stopped,
[27:13.200 --> 27:14.900]  and I realized it was a real...
[27:14.900 --> 27:15.860]  We're in a real situation.
[27:16.020 --> 27:18.540]  This is no longer an imagination thing.
[27:18.820 --> 27:20.720]  Oh, dude.
[27:21.440 --> 27:21.920]  It's my lab.
[27:22.280 --> 27:23.240]  Great lab work, Andrew.
[27:23.340 --> 27:23.960]  Yeah, thanks.
[27:24.400 --> 27:26.620]  Okay, I'll test it.
[27:26.700 --> 27:27.960]  I'll cut them up, as you suggested.
[27:28.340 --> 27:31.040]  See if that makes the sleeping experience any better.
[27:31.460 --> 27:33.380]  Yeah, and try wearing the shocks.
[27:33.760 --> 27:34.520]  Do you think I have enough?
[27:34.560 --> 27:35.100]  I have 10.
[27:35.500 --> 27:36.500]  I'd say it covers...
[27:36.500 --> 27:37.040]  I'd say, yeah.
[27:37.180 --> 27:38.700]  If anything, I have too many, it feels like.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.020]  Would you consider rafting them together?
[27:41.700 --> 27:44.340]  I feel like that ruins the spaghetti aspect of it.
[27:44.900 --> 27:49.760]  But maybe, like, you throw a blanket over it, something could be done.
[27:49.760 --> 27:53.920]  Because I imagine when Geoff conceived sleep spaghetti,
[27:54.280 --> 27:57.820]  they were all sort of tangled up and you would sort of sleep in a heap of spaghetti.
[27:58.160 --> 27:59.320]  Yeah, like a pile of spaghetti.
[28:00.520 --> 28:05.100]  But you can achieve that with jointing the spaghetti he already has.
[28:06.160 --> 28:06.600]  Segmented.
[28:07.020 --> 28:07.300]  Yeah.
[28:07.660 --> 28:12.660]  I'm gonna... yeah, as soon as we're done today, I'll segment this and figure it out.
[28:13.120 --> 28:14.580]  Andrew, I think it's phenomenal work.
[28:14.740 --> 28:15.620]  I love the shocks.
[28:15.760 --> 28:17.040]  I like where you're going with that.
[28:17.040 --> 28:20.280]  The idea of turning socks into fingerless gloves.
[28:20.780 --> 28:24.720]  I think the spaghetti is like, we're just getting closer.
[28:25.540 --> 28:27.040]  Each experiment gets us that much closer.
[28:27.520 --> 28:29.240]  I think it's tremendous work from both of you.
[28:29.600 --> 28:32.380]  I'm only saddened that I haven't been in the lab.
[28:33.100 --> 28:35.920]  Because what you guys have done has been really impressive and inspiring.
[28:36.340 --> 28:40.380]  And I gotta say, this might be the best turnaround to an episode we've ever had.
[28:40.800 --> 28:44.580]  Do you think your breakthrough on fruit gloves deserves an update,
[28:44.660 --> 28:45.900]  or is it not ready to talk about?
[28:45.900 --> 28:47.680]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[28:47.680 --> 28:48.900]  We'll get to that later.
[28:49.400 --> 28:50.540]  I'm not ready. I'm not ready.
[28:50.600 --> 28:51.200]  It'll be... no.
[28:51.520 --> 28:52.900]  Let me... let me think on it some more.
[28:53.860 --> 28:54.820]  Gotta continue to innovate.
[28:55.360 --> 28:57.900]  I like that it sounds like we're both headed straight back to the lab, though.
[28:58.000 --> 28:58.520]  Which is good.
[28:58.580 --> 28:59.520]  Oh, we definitely are.
[28:59.580 --> 29:03.740]  And I feel better about my lab position currently than I think you do about yours.
[29:04.100 --> 29:06.000]  Mine is just awful dog shit.
[29:06.220 --> 29:06.380]  Yeah.
[29:08.060 --> 29:12.340]  I also... I like that your lab has expanded to just your couch as well.
[29:12.860 --> 29:18.120]  I feel like I get heat from my lab being my desk a lot of the time.
[29:18.180 --> 29:19.460]  But you got... you got a couch lab.
[29:19.800 --> 29:20.240]  I'm jealous.
[29:21.220 --> 29:21.360]  Yeah.
[29:21.420 --> 29:22.340]  That's a comfortable lab.
[29:22.720 --> 29:25.240]  I guess my bed is now technically a lab as well.
[29:25.720 --> 29:26.580]  Yeah, that's comfortable.
[29:26.640 --> 29:28.020]  We both really expand in our labs.
[29:29.220 --> 29:30.880]  You think I need more noodles, Gavin?
[29:31.220 --> 29:32.660]  You think more noodles would help?
[29:32.980 --> 29:34.000]  Let me take a look at the picture again.
[29:35.400 --> 29:37.620]  Yeah, I'd say... I'd say you could double it, probably.
[29:37.780 --> 29:39.540]  If they're all segmented and doubled, you could...
[29:39.540 --> 29:43.140]  you could really, like, tunnel your way in and get... and find a really comfortable position.
[29:43.680 --> 29:45.900]  Okay, well, this is what we're gonna do, okay?
[29:46.420 --> 29:48.220]  I'm gonna try these socks out.
[29:48.540 --> 29:51.100]  And if I like them as much as I think I will,
[29:51.460 --> 29:56.720]  then I could double it because I didn't know how many socks it would take to cover a noodle.
[29:57.220 --> 30:00.320]  So I bought two bags of socks and I only needed one.
[30:00.680 --> 30:03.940]  So I have enough sock material to turn them.
[30:04.380 --> 30:06.640]  So I'm... I'm kind of prepped in that way.
[30:06.640 --> 30:07.540]  We'll see.
[30:07.820 --> 30:10.240]  As long as I don't mind turning more socks in the shocks,
[30:10.320 --> 30:13.900]  like, if I'll actually use them, then we might... we might double it.
[30:14.280 --> 30:17.640]  Eric, just to clarify, what is our f*** face R&D budget currently?
[30:18.080 --> 30:18.520]  Zero.
[30:19.060 --> 30:19.980]  Okay, good to know.
[30:19.980 --> 30:21.260]  Yeah, I would say zero.
[30:22.540 --> 30:25.740]  I'm excited to see what else happens in the lab, I suppose.
[30:28.000 --> 30:28.740]  I'm curious.
[30:29.480 --> 30:30.580]  No, I take it back.
[30:30.620 --> 30:31.800]  I'm not curious about shocks.
[30:32.080 --> 30:33.960]  I think I got everything I needed out of shocks.
[30:35.580 --> 30:37.020]  Um, yeah, it's really something.
[30:37.340 --> 30:38.060]  I'm proud of you, Andrew.
[30:38.560 --> 30:39.160]  Thank you.
[30:39.360 --> 30:39.600]  Yeah.
[30:39.880 --> 30:40.980]  Well, I just... I can't wait.
[30:41.100 --> 30:42.880]  Year from now, you're gonna be wearing shocks yourself.
[30:43.340 --> 30:43.560]  I'm not.
[30:43.560 --> 30:44.120]  And you're gonna be like, you know what?
[30:44.140 --> 30:44.580]  I won't be.
[30:44.900 --> 30:45.080]  No.
[30:45.160 --> 30:46.740]  Oh, that's what, you know, they don't...
[30:46.740 --> 30:47.240]  Here's the thing.
[30:47.420 --> 30:52.740]  For the shoes that I wear, I typically wear, like, a very, like, low sock, like an ankle sock.
[30:53.160 --> 31:00.080]  And, uh, cutting the toes off that effectively destroys more than half the sock.
[31:00.560 --> 31:00.800]  Yeah.
[31:00.800 --> 31:02.480]  So I don't really know.
[31:02.920 --> 31:04.480]  It's not really working for me, I suppose.
[31:05.300 --> 31:07.660]  They would have come in handy for the garlic, I think.
[31:08.060 --> 31:09.900]  Oh, yeah.
[31:11.100 --> 31:11.960]  That was bad.
[31:12.020 --> 31:13.200]  I forget that we do that.
[31:13.300 --> 31:15.640]  That's the thought I have, like, every seven months.
[31:15.640 --> 31:18.160]  I'll remember that we did garlic on our feet.
[31:21.340 --> 31:25.760]  It was flashback to having my feet in plastic bags, like grocery bags.
[31:26.120 --> 31:28.020]  And they could have been shocks the whole time.
[31:28.020 --> 31:29.460]  They could have been sho...
[31:29.460 --> 31:31.400]  Well, I don't know if I want to put shocks through that.
[31:32.320 --> 31:33.900]  That was unpleasant.
[31:34.300 --> 31:35.380]  That was awful.
[31:35.900 --> 31:37.080]  On several levels.
[31:46.210 --> 31:48.210]  It's time to level up your game.

[32:14.950 --> 32:16.510]  The roses were living the dream.
[32:16.590 --> 32:17.710]  More champagne for me, please.
[32:18.050 --> 32:19.890]  Until it all came crashing down.
[32:20.270 --> 32:21.050]  You got fired.
[32:21.170 --> 32:21.450]  Fired?
[32:21.930 --> 32:23.690]  From the director of Meet the Parents.
[32:23.810 --> 32:25.350]  You're a failure, women don't like that.
[32:25.430 --> 32:28.090]  If you need a shoulder or an inner thigh, a lean one.
[32:28.510 --> 32:29.910]  On August 29th.
[32:29.910 --> 32:31.110]  I just want the house.
[32:31.250 --> 32:31.990]  We want everything.
[32:33.510 --> 32:35.470]  Stop and see The Roses.
[32:36.150 --> 32:37.030]  These people.
[32:37.370 --> 32:37.970]  The Roses.
[32:38.210 --> 32:38.830]  Rated R.
[32:38.910 --> 32:39.530]  Under 17.
[32:39.610 --> 32:40.430]  Not admitted without parent.
[32:40.710 --> 32:42.610]  In theaters everywhere, August 29th.
[32:42.770 --> 32:44.370]  Hey, it's your mobile hotspot.
[32:44.510 --> 32:47.810]  I can handle a lot, but the other night with everyone live streaming Uncle Miguel at your
[32:47.810 --> 32:48.550]  karaoke party?
[32:48.610 --> 32:51.730]  Here I am, all alone.
[32:52.790 --> 32:55.890]  So many devices, I had trouble keeping up.
[32:56.190 --> 32:58.130]  But Cox Home Internet can keep up with all of it.

[33:17.130 --> 33:18.610]  iPhone or computer.
[33:19.170 --> 33:21.450]  But did you know it only takes a few seconds to get it?
[33:21.650 --> 33:26.210]  That means if you go to add it to your laptop or iPhone right now, you can be done before
[33:26.210 --> 33:27.750]  this ad read is even over.
[33:27.950 --> 33:30.710]  And it always feels great to be able to knock out something immediately.
[33:30.710 --> 33:33.250]  I mean, there's so many things to do in a day.
[33:33.530 --> 33:35.030]  Just being able to get something done quick.
[33:35.670 --> 33:36.110]  It's great.
[33:36.310 --> 33:37.030]  It's a great feeling.
[33:37.190 --> 33:38.490]  And you know what else works fast?
[33:38.910 --> 33:40.430]  Honey's deal finding abilities.
[33:40.930 --> 33:44.810]  Honey is the free shopping tool that scours the internet for promo codes and applies the
[33:44.810 --> 33:46.270]  best one it finds to your cart.
[33:46.830 --> 33:49.530]  How it works is imagine you're shopping on one of your favorite sites.
[33:49.710 --> 33:53.930]  When you check out, the Honey button appears and all you have to do is click apply coupons.
[33:54.390 --> 33:57.390]  Wait a few seconds as Honey searches for coupons it can find for that site.
[33:57.390 --> 34:01.470]  If Honey finds a working coupon, you'll watch the prices drop.
[34:01.950 --> 34:06.770]  I have used Honey and save money on so many things from clothing, food, technology.
[34:07.290 --> 34:08.470]  It's so easy to use.
[34:08.550 --> 34:09.530]  It's so easy to download.

[34:12.770 --> 34:14.990]  Did you know that Honey doesn't just work on desktops?
[34:15.170 --> 34:16.390]  It works on your iPhone too.

[34:34.250 --> 34:36.630]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[34:37.330 --> 34:40.570]  There are so many times, especially growing up,
[34:40.690 --> 34:46.530]  I felt directionless, not really knowing what I wanted to do with my future, the fear.
[34:48.030 --> 34:48.890]  It sucks.
[34:49.010 --> 34:49.890]  It's not a fun time.
[34:50.190 --> 34:53.350]  Even now, it's like so easy to second guess what your direction is.
[34:53.890 --> 34:59.910]  I found just trying stuff and doing new experiences and just learning from those to be super helpful.
[35:00.170 --> 35:04.490]  But sometimes it's great to talk to someone about those kinds of issues.
[35:05.150 --> 35:08.850]  Whether you're dealing with decisions around your career, relationships, or anything else,
[35:09.090 --> 35:15.030]  you can move forward with confidence and excitement through therapy or other methods.
[35:15.250 --> 35:19.030]  I know therapy is something for me that has been super beneficial.
[35:19.710 --> 35:26.350]  It has helped me in not just understanding some of my past trauma or anxiety issues, but
[35:27.970 --> 35:31.470]  approaching them in a way that I don't think I ever would have naturally come to by myself.
[35:31.590 --> 35:35.590]  So I would highly recommend that experience and that process to anyone.
[35:36.570 --> 35:39.290]  If you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.
[35:39.990 --> 35:44.170]  It's entirely online, designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.

[36:16.310 --> 36:17.370]  Yeah, dude, do it.
[36:18.750 --> 36:23.830]  Mondays, 4 p.m. Central Time on RT and the F*** Face YouTube. We're live. We're doing the break
[36:23.830 --> 36:27.610]  show. It's weekly every Monday. If there's a Monday where we're off, we're not pre-recording
[36:27.610 --> 36:31.430]  it. We just won't do one that week. And then the VOD. So if you want to watch it later,
[36:31.730 --> 36:35.870]  it'll be up on Thursday on Rooster Teeth first and then Friday for the on the F*** Face YouTube
[36:35.870 --> 36:39.750]  channel. So there you go. I figure if we put it in the middle of the episode, it's more effective
[36:39.750 --> 36:43.210]  than the very, very end. You know what I mean? And we're starting in August, right?
[36:43.210 --> 36:48.710]  August 7th. So it'll be the first. I think what? That's next week when this one comes out. So.
[36:48.930 --> 36:50.670]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Perfect. Very, very soon.
[36:51.150 --> 36:56.030]  And when you say and I'd like to reemphasize the point, the majority of Mondays.
[36:56.450 --> 36:58.010]  Yeah, yes. Yeah, absolutely.
[36:58.290 --> 36:59.490]  Certainly not every Monday.
[36:59.690 --> 37:01.030]  Yeah, but most Mondays.
[37:01.490 --> 37:05.050]  Gavin and Andrew, you guys are also welcome to be on it.
[37:05.050 --> 37:05.630]  Always invited.
[37:06.230 --> 37:12.690]  The invitation's always there. Geoff, myself and Emily are going to be opening cards and then maybe
[37:12.690 --> 37:16.530]  Gus will be there sometimes. You remember Gus? You remember him? He might be there sometimes.
[37:16.710 --> 37:17.850]  Yeah, yeah.
[37:18.050 --> 37:19.750]  Jack'll invite himself on for sure.
[37:20.130 --> 37:26.510]  No, he's busy. So, you know, we'll be it'll be fun every every Monday, 4 p.m. Central.
[37:26.770 --> 37:27.510]  So there you go.
[37:28.110 --> 37:30.570]  Did you ever collect Gus's cards from?
[37:30.730 --> 37:33.150]  We have Gus's cards. Yeah, he wants to open them. We're going to do that.
[37:33.330 --> 37:34.570]  He's desperate to get rid of them.
[37:34.710 --> 37:36.310]  So yeah, he wants them gone so badly.
[37:37.350 --> 37:38.970]  Did you brand the shocks?
[37:39.650 --> 37:41.530]  No, not me. Nick did.
[37:41.530 --> 37:43.110]  Yeah, you know.
[37:43.470 --> 37:44.770]  Oh, I like it.
[37:46.510 --> 37:47.230]  Oh, dude.
[37:48.410 --> 37:50.770]  Can I have that look on a foot?
[37:51.930 --> 37:58.490]  I don't want to know. I talked to I talked to Tony because I had to send him your knives or.
[37:58.750 --> 37:59.310]  Oh, the forks?
[37:59.350 --> 38:00.510]  What were they? They were forks.
[38:00.610 --> 38:01.030]  The forks.
[38:01.130 --> 38:01.310]  Forkspressions.
[38:01.430 --> 38:03.130]  Whatever. Forkspressions.
[38:03.330 --> 38:03.830]  Fun forks.
[38:03.950 --> 38:04.070]  Yeah.
[38:04.150 --> 38:08.630]  Yeah, I had a I had a merch meeting and Tony was like, what about this thing?
[38:08.630 --> 38:10.030]  And I said, you got to ask. I don't know.
[38:10.030 --> 38:12.790]  I don't know what to say about those.
[38:13.010 --> 38:13.810]  Oh, yeah.
[38:14.090 --> 38:15.950]  I just thought of a slogan for them.
[38:15.970 --> 38:16.890]  Oh, what's the slogan?
[38:17.750 --> 38:18.110]  Forkspressions.
[38:18.350 --> 38:19.190]  Eat your feelings.
[38:19.810 --> 38:20.170]  Wow.
[38:20.370 --> 38:21.710]  Don't you couldn't use that?
[38:21.770 --> 38:23.210]  I like that. There's just no way.
[38:23.550 --> 38:24.250]  No, you definitely could.
[38:24.630 --> 38:26.170]  Yeah, because Gavin's already.
[38:26.310 --> 38:27.270]  I could send him to Gavin.
[38:27.370 --> 38:28.690]  He'll try him because he's already poisoned.
[38:29.010 --> 38:29.910]  So it can't get worse.
[38:30.370 --> 38:30.630]  That's true.
[38:30.690 --> 38:31.330]  Gavin, are you still alive?
[38:31.610 --> 38:32.470]  OK, yeah, I'm still here.
[38:32.570 --> 38:33.090]  Yeah, I'm good.
[38:34.570 --> 38:38.610]  Hey, Andrew, just so we're on the same page, you're human.
[38:39.330 --> 38:39.650]  Yeah.
[38:40.070 --> 38:41.010]  OK, all right.
[38:41.110 --> 38:41.470]  You heard it.
[38:41.570 --> 38:41.690]  Why?
[38:42.150 --> 38:42.470]  Fair enough.
[38:42.630 --> 38:43.150]  No, no reason.
[38:44.170 --> 38:45.150]  Hey, I had an idea.
[38:46.090 --> 38:49.130]  I had an idea for a new draft I wanted to run by you guys.
[38:49.630 --> 38:49.950]  OK.
[38:50.210 --> 38:52.650]  I don't want to like beat the drafts to death,
[38:52.670 --> 38:54.950]  but I kind of also want to keep doing them forever.
[38:55.150 --> 38:55.250]  Yeah.
[38:56.250 --> 39:00.130]  I don't know how feasible this one is to release.
[39:00.990 --> 39:02.990]  So it may be an idea that you guys say,
[39:03.110 --> 39:04.690]  hey, it's a cool idea, but we'll never do it
[39:04.690 --> 39:06.190]  because it would be hard to make.
[39:06.190 --> 39:11.010]  But wouldn't it be fun to do a funniest moments in film draft?
[39:11.930 --> 39:12.330]  Yes.
[39:12.710 --> 39:16.190]  You pick the four funniest moments in film to you,
[39:16.330 --> 39:17.090]  and then we all present them.
[39:17.350 --> 39:20.190]  Because, Andrew, you were just talking about how you saw Dirty Work recently,
[39:20.410 --> 39:24.710]  and you and I were talking back and forth about our favorite moments from Dirty Work.
[39:24.870 --> 39:26.850]  And there's a moment that Gavin and I always reference
[39:26.850 --> 39:29.770]  that I think is one of the four funniest moments in the history of film.
[39:30.430 --> 39:32.610]  And that got me thinking about all my other favorite moments,
[39:32.690 --> 39:34.290]  and it'd be fun to share that in some way.
[39:35.130 --> 39:36.150]  I like that.
[39:36.530 --> 39:39.570]  We have the Summer of 98 ranking coming out.
[39:39.730 --> 39:41.550]  Maybe that even could be a better format for...
[39:42.070 --> 39:43.310]  Maybe it's not even a draft.
[39:43.430 --> 39:47.390]  Maybe it's like a debate, a consensus ranking, potentially.
[39:47.790 --> 39:48.610]  Because the film will be aligned.
[39:49.110 --> 39:52.030]  Out of curiosity, how many of the 98 movies have you guys seen?
[39:52.110 --> 39:53.650]  Like, I know Gavin's seen 10.
[39:53.910 --> 39:55.170]  I've seen 10 from your list.
[39:55.450 --> 39:58.970]  Yeah. Also, I haven't talked to TPG about this.
[39:59.030 --> 39:59.710]  I was talking...
[39:59.710 --> 40:02.190]  He asked me about how the Summer of 98 movie stuff was going.
[40:02.510 --> 40:04.190]  I sent him... I ranked all of them.
[40:04.190 --> 40:04.990]  Just personally.
[40:05.390 --> 40:09.990]  1 through 32 of what I think the most Summer of 98 film is in the least.
[40:10.390 --> 40:17.310]  And he sent me an audio clip of him reacting to my rankings and giving analysis on every pick.
[40:17.650 --> 40:19.350]  We should throw that into the lat...
[40:19.350 --> 40:22.150]  Like at the end of our draft or something.
[40:22.230 --> 40:23.130]  It should definitely go somewhere.
[40:23.230 --> 40:23.490]  Oh, that's great.
[40:23.710 --> 40:24.230]  It's great.
[40:24.390 --> 40:25.990]  His analysis is fantastic.
[40:27.090 --> 40:28.570]  Uh, I'm counting. Hold on.
[40:29.170 --> 40:31.270]  You know, I think I have to put Basketball number one.
[40:32.370 --> 40:33.330]  We'll see.
[40:33.330 --> 40:34.650]  We'll see about that.
[40:35.310 --> 40:36.710]  I think it could get contentious.
[40:37.030 --> 40:38.270]  Is Nick a movie guy?
[40:38.610 --> 40:40.350]  I don't know if Nick's a movie guy or not.
[40:40.450 --> 40:41.250]  Nick, are you a movie guy?
[40:42.310 --> 40:43.130]  He's just muted.
[40:43.330 --> 40:44.170]  Are you wearing a mask?
[40:44.410 --> 40:47.850]  He was unmuted the whole time and then muted himself to talk.
[40:48.570 --> 40:49.370]  Because he's...
[40:49.370 --> 40:53.170]  Because like every audio engineer here at this company, it's backwards.
[40:53.490 --> 40:55.290]  And his audio is the worst.
[40:55.570 --> 40:59.190]  It sounds like you spoke to him the second he got up to take a piss.
[40:59.250 --> 40:59.930]  Is what it sounds like.
[41:00.150 --> 41:01.250]  It does feel that way.
[41:01.750 --> 41:03.190]  Eric, do you know if Nick's a movie guy?
[41:03.330 --> 41:05.350]  I don't. I'm not sure.
[41:06.990 --> 41:09.390]  I would imagine he is. He's a radio guy.
[41:09.490 --> 41:10.890]  So I would imagine he's a movie guy.
[41:11.530 --> 41:12.170]  I bet he is too.
[41:12.490 --> 41:13.550]  Yeah, I would think so.
[41:13.830 --> 41:15.550]  I've seen 24 of these films.
[41:15.730 --> 41:16.670]  You've seen 24?
[41:17.270 --> 41:17.550]  Wow.
[41:18.550 --> 41:19.870]  That's so many of them.
[41:20.590 --> 41:21.410]  Uh, yeah. How about you, Eric?
[41:21.410 --> 41:21.670]  That's a lot of them.
[41:21.990 --> 41:23.190]  I'd have to do a count.
[41:23.350 --> 41:26.210]  But instead of waiting for me, Geoff should start talking about Vegas.
[41:26.590 --> 41:28.550]  God, do you think there's enough time left to talk about Vegas?
[41:29.270 --> 41:30.490]  I mean, we have another one.
[41:30.490 --> 41:34.930]  And also, yes, because it's what, 40 minutes right now?
[41:35.050 --> 41:35.890]  35 minutes?
[41:36.650 --> 41:36.850]  Okay.
[41:38.870 --> 41:46.290]  So last weekend for the wedding, my soon-to-be father-in-law and soon-to-be brother-in-law
[41:46.290 --> 41:50.570]  invited me out to Las Vegas to watch NBA Summer League games
[41:50.570 --> 41:53.750]  as kind of like a bachelor's weekend kind of thing, you know?
[41:54.730 --> 41:57.230]  And I thought that was very sweet and kind of them.
[41:57.310 --> 41:59.610]  And we all kind of like bond over sports.
[41:59.610 --> 42:01.630]  And I am a huge NBA fan, obviously.
[42:01.830 --> 42:04.110]  And I've been to the Summer League once before and had the time of my life
[42:04.110 --> 42:06.070]  and really wanted to relive that experience.
[42:06.250 --> 42:09.090]  And I also, the first time I did it, I did it completely by myself.
[42:09.130 --> 42:10.870]  So the idea of doing it with friends was cool, too.
[42:12.350 --> 42:18.850]  And so I flew out Friday and got there, checked into my hotel.
[42:19.010 --> 42:24.690]  We were staying at The Wynn and met up with my father-in-law and brother-in-law.
[42:25.170 --> 42:26.470]  I'll just call him father-in-law and brother-in-law.
[42:26.610 --> 42:28.030]  It'll be just around the corner anyway.
[42:30.150 --> 42:32.670]  And hung out with them in the sports book and did a little
[42:32.670 --> 42:34.790]  bet on some horses, came out about even.
[42:35.290 --> 42:39.090]  And then went to, they invited me out to dinner at this Jose Andres restaurant
[42:39.090 --> 42:41.370]  called Bizarre Meats that we always eat at when we go to Vegas.
[42:42.530 --> 42:45.910]  My father-in-law is a huge, like, Jose Andres fan.
[42:46.410 --> 42:48.710]  A lot of his charitable work and his food and stuff.
[42:48.790 --> 42:51.070]  And so I kind of thought it'd be cool for him to go to this restaurant
[42:51.070 --> 42:51.890]  because he'd never been before.
[42:52.610 --> 42:57.750]  And so they made a reservation and we walked around a corner to a table
[42:57.750 --> 43:00.170]  that was full of people that I knew.
[43:00.370 --> 43:01.730]  And I was not expecting that.
[43:02.330 --> 43:04.650]  A real life blindside, you might say.
[43:05.050 --> 43:07.290]  An incredible blindside.
[43:08.130 --> 43:12.410]  Sitting around that table were my favorite people in the world that were boys.
[43:12.830 --> 43:16.190]  My cousin Christopher and Gavin and Jack.
[43:16.810 --> 43:18.190]  And that was it.
[43:18.490 --> 43:19.690]  We were planning it and...
[43:19.690 --> 43:21.310]  Come on.
[43:23.990 --> 43:26.310]  We were planning it and Kent was like,
[43:26.310 --> 43:30.050]  we should surprise him, get to the meal before him and all that.
[43:30.110 --> 43:33.950]  And then we realized that we couldn't fly any time near when you were flying
[43:33.950 --> 43:35.510]  because we're all coming from the same place.
[43:36.050 --> 43:37.390]  So we had to get an earlier flight.
[43:37.690 --> 43:39.350]  You were flying, what time did you fly? Like 2 something?
[43:39.810 --> 43:41.650]  I flew out at like 2.30, I think.
[43:41.930 --> 43:44.210]  Yeah, our flight took off at 8am.
[43:45.030 --> 43:46.270]  Mine was at 9.
[43:46.730 --> 43:50.930]  We all thought there's no way that we can fly around the same time Geoff is.
[43:51.170 --> 43:52.930]  Anyway, that's what most of us thought.
[43:53.590 --> 43:54.890]  You know what's funny about that too?
[43:54.890 --> 43:58.030]  I got to the airport a little early because I was bored.
[43:58.330 --> 44:03.350]  And so I tried to see how fast I could walk from the first terminal to the last terminal and back.
[44:03.810 --> 44:05.410]  So I absolutely... and I timed it.
[44:05.470 --> 44:08.490]  I absolutely would have run into anybody that was in the airport.
[44:08.930 --> 44:10.250]  How fast could you do it?
[44:10.590 --> 44:13.230]  It took me about nine minutes to run into the other and back.
[44:13.450 --> 44:14.990]  Or one into the other and then nine minutes to go back.
[44:15.390 --> 44:18.170]  Yeah, I woke up at 5am and then we had...
[44:18.170 --> 44:21.290]  Once we got to Vegas, we had 11 hours to kill.
[44:24.330 --> 44:26.730]  So what did you guys do for 11 hours?
[44:28.170 --> 44:30.370]  We had some mugs.
[44:31.570 --> 44:33.530]  We played roulette.
[44:34.010 --> 44:36.810]  And then we went to the pool.
[44:37.130 --> 44:38.990]  Can we talk about the roulette thing?
[44:39.570 --> 44:40.410]  What happened with roulette?
[44:41.050 --> 44:46.550]  Gavin told me earlier in the week that he has like a streak going in Vegas.
[44:46.970 --> 44:51.070]  Where he only plays... was it you only play like roulette like one game?
[44:51.290 --> 44:54.430]  Yeah, I try and walk into a casino on my trip to Vegas.
[44:54.630 --> 44:56.750]  I put down $100 on one color.
[44:57.230 --> 45:00.190]  And the last four trips to Vegas, I've won.
[45:00.750 --> 45:03.870]  And then I just take the $200 and I don't gamble again.
[45:05.490 --> 45:09.230]  So that's what he said in this text.
[45:09.850 --> 45:13.270]  And he's... we were like, oh, he's put it on black or whatever.
[45:13.470 --> 45:16.190]  And I just said like, I don't know who can sit... like think about red.
[45:16.910 --> 45:20.050]  Yeah, I was flying to... I was texting Eric leading up to this trip.
[45:20.050 --> 45:22.390]  I was like, yeah, you know, I'm thinking it's... I'm thinking it's black.
[45:22.490 --> 45:23.250]  It's going to be black.
[45:23.970 --> 45:26.210]  Eric convinced me that red might be an option.
[45:26.630 --> 45:30.070]  All I said was who bets on red? Red might be an option.
[45:30.890 --> 45:34.550]  He's playing this like I twisted his arm to do red.
[45:35.550 --> 45:36.510]  Not what happened.
[45:36.730 --> 45:39.870]  I simply inceptioned the idea into him.
[45:40.950 --> 45:41.390]  So...
[45:41.390 --> 45:42.490]  And then I thought it'd be... oh.
[45:42.930 --> 45:43.590]  That's just time.
[45:44.010 --> 45:45.490]  Oh, cool. Thanks, man.
[45:45.970 --> 45:46.070]  Yeah.
[45:46.630 --> 45:50.030]  Then I thought it'd be cool if like I put it to Eric and Jack.
[45:50.030 --> 45:51.430]  Maybe you want to bet with me.
[45:51.530 --> 45:52.770]  Maybe you want to bet against me.
[45:53.070 --> 45:54.490]  Maybe get in on the same.
[45:54.910 --> 45:56.250]  Yeah, get in on the same spin.
[45:57.190 --> 45:59.050]  So Gavin lays down his hunt.
[45:59.130 --> 46:01.350]  There's no one else at this roulette table.
[46:01.550 --> 46:02.790]  There's one other one and it's hopping.
[46:03.090 --> 46:04.790]  This one's empty at the win.
[46:06.110 --> 46:08.450]  And Gavin walks over and we're trying to...
[46:08.450 --> 46:08.970]  Oh, is it the time?
[46:09.070 --> 46:09.470]  Okay. Yeah. Okay.
[46:09.470 --> 46:10.030]  We're going to do it.
[46:10.130 --> 46:11.130]  What color are you going to go with?
[46:11.210 --> 46:11.470]  Whatever.
[46:12.650 --> 46:14.050]  Jack is like, I'm in for 60.
[46:14.130 --> 46:16.010]  I'm like, I'll put 40 in, you know, whatever.
[46:16.510 --> 46:17.230]  Let's see what happens.
[46:17.230 --> 46:19.670]  And Gavin picks red.
[46:20.250 --> 46:21.670]  So Jack picks red.
[46:21.870 --> 46:23.390]  And then I pick black.
[46:24.590 --> 46:24.870]  And...
[46:24.870 --> 46:28.350]  Eric picking what he twisted my arm away from.
[46:28.370 --> 46:29.410]  Yeah, twisted his arm.
[46:29.770 --> 46:33.370]  If Jack would have picked black, I would have picked red.
[46:33.510 --> 46:35.190]  We just needed to do opposites.
[46:35.270 --> 46:36.250]  So that way it paid out.
[46:36.570 --> 46:40.430]  And the dealer or whatever at the roulette table was like, oh, good.
[46:40.450 --> 46:41.470]  Now there's like some action.
[46:41.750 --> 46:43.270]  Like, you know, something's going to happen.
[46:44.650 --> 46:46.590]  He spins the roulette wheel.
[46:47.250 --> 46:48.990]  Spins the ball into it.
[46:48.990 --> 46:49.830]  It goes.
[46:50.450 --> 46:52.630]  And it hits double zero green.
[46:52.690 --> 46:54.130]  And we lost all of our money.
[46:55.770 --> 46:57.010]  Are you serious?
[46:57.170 --> 46:59.930]  We all just burst out laughing.
[47:00.070 --> 47:01.270]  I almost fell on the floor.
[47:01.890 --> 47:07.950]  And then we all just walked away from the roulette table having between us lost $200.
[47:08.930 --> 47:10.410]  And it might be the best.
[47:10.650 --> 47:13.190]  It might be the best loss of money in my life.
[47:13.250 --> 47:14.070]  It was so well spent.
[47:14.310 --> 47:15.310]  It was so funny.
[47:15.310 --> 47:17.370]  And we just couldn't believe it.
[47:18.030 --> 47:20.150]  The roulette dealer was even shocked.
[47:20.250 --> 47:21.390]  He just had his mouth agape.
[47:21.490 --> 47:24.490]  And he just went, I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[47:25.290 --> 47:26.230]  That was it.
[47:27.010 --> 47:34.430]  Andrew, later that day, after we finish dinner, we go and there's roulette tables and craps.
[47:34.570 --> 47:36.550]  Jack is, you talk about twisting arms.
[47:36.710 --> 47:38.730]  Jack wants everyone to play fucking craps.
[47:39.070 --> 47:39.950]  Oh my God, dude.
[47:40.030 --> 47:41.210]  Jack has a problem.
[47:41.570 --> 47:42.850]  Jack's a craps guy.
[47:43.150 --> 47:44.310]  Yeah, Jesus Christ.
[47:44.310 --> 47:45.690]  He taught me how craps work.
[47:45.910 --> 47:46.310]  Yeah.
[47:46.470 --> 47:49.210]  We finally learned how craps works later in the trip.
[47:49.290 --> 47:51.690]  But he taught us some stuff.
[47:52.570 --> 47:55.510]  There's a roulette table, Andrew, and no one's at it.
[47:57.050 --> 47:57.850]  Gavin goes...
[47:57.850 --> 47:59.910]  I get weird when it's, when there's like a shitload of other people.
[48:00.050 --> 48:03.830]  Like I don't really, I don't want to mess it up, but I want to like get in people's way.
[48:04.110 --> 48:07.130]  So I just wait until there's just literally no one at the roulette table.
[48:07.410 --> 48:10.190]  So Gavin went over, another hundred bucks.
[48:11.030 --> 48:12.090]  On red.
[48:13.290 --> 48:14.490]  It spins.
[48:15.170 --> 48:15.770]  No.
[48:16.330 --> 48:20.050]  Well, first you got to say that because now that the group was bigger.
[48:20.210 --> 48:24.690]  So now Geoff's father-in-law wants to get in on this action.
[48:24.870 --> 48:26.430]  He bets against me.
[48:26.750 --> 48:27.650]  He goes on black.
[48:28.110 --> 48:28.270]  Yep.
[48:28.490 --> 48:29.870]  So now there's some action, Andrew.
[48:31.230 --> 48:31.830]  No.
[48:32.310 --> 48:32.530]  It spins.
[48:33.550 --> 48:33.950]  No.
[48:34.730 --> 48:35.310]  No.
[48:36.210 --> 48:36.670]  Again.
[48:37.190 --> 48:37.390]  Yep.
[48:37.570 --> 48:38.090]  No.
[48:38.630 --> 48:39.270]  I got damned.
[48:39.270 --> 48:42.990]  This is what happened to Dan when he was, my luck has run out.
[48:43.550 --> 48:44.830]  I've got Dan luck now.
[48:45.070 --> 48:46.390]  I think Dan has the luck.
[48:47.390 --> 48:50.230]  Gavin walked around in a daze all weekend.
[48:50.730 --> 48:54.790]  At one point, we walked by, we saw a place that was playing, where they were playing War.
[48:54.990 --> 48:56.630]  You know that game where it's just like high or low?
[48:57.190 --> 49:01.550]  And I, as a joke, I sat down and it was like 25 bucks a hand.
[49:02.030 --> 49:04.270]  And so I just sat down and just played.
[49:04.750 --> 49:08.050]  And with like, I put, I don't know, I played like five times and I came out even.
[49:08.110 --> 49:09.150]  And I was like, oh, that was pretty fun.
[49:09.150 --> 49:10.850]  That was actually more fun than I thought it would be.
[49:11.250 --> 49:12.330]  I go, Gavin, you should try it.
[49:12.370 --> 49:14.190]  And he goes, no, my luck is, I've lost my luck.
[49:14.510 --> 49:14.830]  Terrible.
[49:14.950 --> 49:16.330]  And I go, he goes, I don't want to blow any more money.
[49:16.390 --> 49:17.850]  And I go, here's a hundred dollars.
[49:18.030 --> 49:19.730]  Just sit down and play it.
[49:19.750 --> 49:20.510]  You're going to have fun.
[49:20.570 --> 49:21.270]  You can't lose.
[49:21.370 --> 49:21.990]  It's 50-50.
[49:22.410 --> 49:23.430]  I swear to God.
[49:23.490 --> 49:25.250]  It goes, hand one, gives it $25.
[49:25.590 --> 49:26.790]  Hand two, gives it $25.
[49:27.070 --> 49:28.190]  Pull three, gives $25.
[49:28.470 --> 49:29.630]  Pull four, gives $25.
[49:29.890 --> 49:31.970]  $100 gone that fast.
[49:32.170 --> 49:33.850]  It was about 45 seconds.
[49:34.170 --> 49:38.050]  And also it was like, the numbers were, it was like, my first card was a five.
[49:38.050 --> 49:39.750]  And then it was like dealer seven.
[49:39.870 --> 49:41.570]  It's like, oh, and then my number kept getting higher.
[49:41.650 --> 49:42.490]  Then I was like on a nine.
[49:42.590 --> 49:43.630]  It was like, oh, it was a jack.
[49:43.830 --> 49:45.850]  Then I got a queen and the dealer has a king.
[49:45.910 --> 49:50.110]  It's like, I felt like I was going to get there and it just didn't work out for me.
[49:50.370 --> 49:52.050]  I pissed away that hundred.
[49:52.770 --> 49:53.610]  It was faster.
[49:54.490 --> 49:58.890]  He lost $100 faster at war than he did at roulette twice.
[49:59.190 --> 50:00.070]  Easily, easily.
[50:00.350 --> 50:04.110]  I lost four times at war in the time it would have taken the ball to land at a color.
[50:06.950 --> 50:12.030]  Uh, Gavin's luck was so bad that when he tried to get more money out of the ATM,
[50:12.970 --> 50:14.750]  it would not do it.
[50:14.870 --> 50:17.030]  And he tried seven times.
[50:17.390 --> 50:19.810]  That's why I had to give him $100 to encourage him to play.
[50:19.910 --> 50:20.310]  Yeah.
[50:20.330 --> 50:24.130]  Well, I hit my withdrawal limit from my bank, which is apparently $400.
[50:24.810 --> 50:27.430]  And I think, honestly, I think that was for the best.
[50:27.610 --> 50:32.430]  It kept me from starting a losing streak that would have gone, would have gone out of hand.
[50:32.430 --> 50:35.610]  Hey, now you, now you know why they have those withdrawal limits.
[50:35.870 --> 50:36.150]  Yeah.
[50:36.890 --> 50:40.610]  Anyway, when no one was watching, I went over to roulette and I put it on red and I hit.
[50:41.270 --> 50:41.670]  Great.
[50:42.050 --> 50:42.250]  Yeah.
[50:42.710 --> 50:47.330]  Yeah, I watched, I watched Eric sneak away from everyone watching Jack play craps.
[50:47.450 --> 50:50.750]  And, uh, I just found him on a roulette table just with a pile of chips.
[50:52.230 --> 50:53.130]  I made like a hundred bucks.
[50:53.910 --> 50:55.350]  So I didn't see it.
[50:55.490 --> 50:58.090]  All I got to witness was Gavin's gambling failure.
[50:58.110 --> 51:02.410]  But you guys did tell me that Gavin at least had one very cool, smooth moment.
[51:03.470 --> 51:04.730]  Oh my God.
[51:05.630 --> 51:08.990]  If we were in our twenties, if we were younger men and this happened,
[51:09.150 --> 51:13.930]  it would have been like, we would have waited until like the waitress walked away to congratulate Gavin.
[51:14.190 --> 51:15.730]  But we were at the pool.
[51:16.490 --> 51:18.110]  Uh, we were waiting for you guys.
[51:18.170 --> 51:18.630]  You're in the sun.
[51:18.710 --> 51:19.210]  It was nice.
[51:19.310 --> 51:21.850]  The waitress comes over and she goes, Oh, do you guys want a drink?
[51:22.210 --> 51:25.770]  So we ordered drinks and she's like, Oh, do you want to charge them to the rooms?
[51:25.870 --> 51:26.290]  I said, yep.
[51:26.370 --> 51:29.630]  And so, uh, Jack gives his room number and his last name.
[51:29.670 --> 51:31.170]  I give my room number and my last name.
[51:31.170 --> 51:32.370]  And, uh, she goes, Oh, yours.
[51:32.510 --> 51:37.770]  And Gavin, uh, goes, Oh, you know, 21, 20 free.
[51:37.890 --> 51:39.870]  And she goes, you have an accent.
[51:42.130 --> 51:43.870]  Not even you're British.
[51:44.610 --> 51:45.890]  You have an accent.
[51:46.170 --> 51:47.590]  She is maybe 20.
[51:47.690 --> 51:48.950]  I think maybe.
[51:50.310 --> 51:52.930]  And Gavin went, uh, yep, absolutely.
[51:53.110 --> 51:54.230]  And then she went, Oh, I'm sorry.
[51:54.270 --> 51:55.090]  What was your last name?
[51:55.110 --> 51:55.810]  And he went free.
[51:56.050 --> 51:56.670]  F R E E.
[51:57.470 --> 52:01.030]  Oh, do you get anything free with that?
[52:01.170 --> 52:01.790]  Name.
[52:01.910 --> 52:03.990]  And he just went, maybe this drink.
[52:05.890 --> 52:06.330]  Silence.
[52:06.950 --> 52:10.510]  And then me and Jack going, Oh, damn, man.
[52:10.770 --> 52:12.450]  We use that one all the time.
[52:12.530 --> 52:13.410]  Holy shit.
[52:13.670 --> 52:14.330]  Way to go.
[52:14.770 --> 52:16.210]  She gave a great grin.
[52:16.370 --> 52:20.490]  And then, and then you, we just started celebrating the smoothness of the line.
[52:20.590 --> 52:23.750]  But like before she left and it was like, Oh, we're just a bunch of old nerds.
[52:23.750 --> 52:24.790]  Oh, the dorky shit.
[52:25.170 --> 52:28.010]  And Gavin went, I've never said that before in my life.
[52:29.290 --> 52:32.970]  I think it was, it was, it was smooth because I said it with no hesitation.
[52:32.970 --> 52:34.250]  Like it just came out.
[52:34.290 --> 52:35.870]  Like I said it a thousand times.
[52:36.850 --> 52:38.070]  It didn't work either.
[52:38.130 --> 52:39.810]  It was a $28 drink.
[52:39.910 --> 52:40.910]  Oh God.
[52:41.150 --> 52:45.270]  But yeah, I think I walked away from that thinking, wow, I've got, I maybe I've got game now.
[52:46.330 --> 52:47.610]  How was the drink though?
[52:47.610 --> 52:48.130]  Was it good?
[52:48.670 --> 52:48.890]  Yeah.
[52:49.550 --> 52:50.910]  Got a Miami Vice.
[52:51.550 --> 52:51.770]  Yeah.
[52:51.790 --> 52:52.630]  I didn't know what that was.
[52:53.310 --> 52:56.290]  Eric introduced, Eric introduced me to a lot of stuff this weekend.
[52:56.290 --> 52:56.890]  All weekend.
[52:57.050 --> 52:58.210]  It was everything I ordered.
[52:58.350 --> 52:59.350]  Gavin went, Oh, me too.
[52:59.890 --> 53:03.110]  Well, I like trying new shit and I just always order the same stuff.
[53:03.190 --> 53:04.910]  So I was, you know, I'm in Vegas with different people.
[53:04.950 --> 53:05.970]  I'm going to try different stuff.
[53:06.190 --> 53:07.030]  I thought you did great.
[53:07.190 --> 53:10.530]  I thought everything you ordered was really good because it's what I got and I liked it.
[53:10.750 --> 53:11.430]  So it was.
[53:11.750 --> 53:13.330]  But yeah, I think, I think she was impressed.
[53:13.650 --> 53:14.290]  Oh yeah.
[53:14.650 --> 53:18.510]  I think she was impressed because you, again, didn't say, Oh, you're British.
[53:18.630 --> 53:20.130]  She just said you have an accent.
[53:21.030 --> 53:25.090]  Also it's Vegas where that's the least impressive thing in the world.
[53:25.430 --> 53:25.810]  Yeah.
[53:25.810 --> 53:30.270]  I think it's because Americans don't often have the confidence to call out the difference between
[53:30.270 --> 53:31.270]  Australian and British.
[53:31.510 --> 53:32.550]  So they just say accent.
[53:32.990 --> 53:33.710]  I get that a lot.
[53:34.150 --> 53:34.330]  Yeah.
[53:34.790 --> 53:35.270]  Interesting.
[53:35.730 --> 53:36.130]  Interesting.
[53:36.990 --> 53:40.230]  But that was, that was our first kind of like day.
[53:40.670 --> 53:49.650]  And then, Oh, and then we had to hide in our hotel room until Geoff made his way in.
[53:50.430 --> 53:54.330]  And then like, didn't go to his hotel room, just hung out at the sports book.
[53:54.350 --> 53:55.410]  So we couldn't come down.
[53:56.310 --> 54:02.030]  We had to, from the, from the, no, from the time you landed, which was like five or something
[54:02.030 --> 54:04.690]  until the meal at eight, we, we were scarce.
[54:05.190 --> 54:05.350]  Yeah.
[54:05.990 --> 54:10.170]  Like we had gone like way before and then had to like go over to like the casino early,
[54:10.170 --> 54:11.370]  like the other casino early.
[54:11.690 --> 54:12.450]  And it was like, what?
[54:12.730 --> 54:12.830]  What?
[54:13.030 --> 54:18.830]  We were getting texts from Kent too, who was keeping us, keeping us informed of where you
[54:18.830 --> 54:18.910]  were.
[54:18.970 --> 54:20.730]  He was like, Gotis is on the move.
[54:21.490 --> 54:21.890]  Gotis?
[54:21.890 --> 54:25.010]  We're like the fucking Geoff of the United States.
[54:27.430 --> 54:29.490]  I forgot you guys called me Gotis all weekend.
[54:30.790 --> 54:34.150]  And what was the deal with my cousin bringing all of his climbing gear?
[54:36.710 --> 54:43.250]  Well, your, your idiotic cousin decided to fly at what?
[54:43.410 --> 54:46.250]  A 10, a flight that was 10 minutes apart from your one?
[54:46.790 --> 54:51.450]  Like we were in Vegas and he was, he was like headed to the airport and we were like six
[54:51.450 --> 54:52.450]  hours into our time.
[54:54.090 --> 54:56.430]  And he was like, Oh yeah, I didn't even think about it.
[54:57.290 --> 55:03.590]  I knew Gavin was upset that this could get blown because he started participating in
[55:03.590 --> 55:04.390]  the group text.
[55:04.550 --> 55:10.910]  And he said, Chris, if you fuck this for me and I woke up at 5am for nothing, I'm going
[55:10.910 --> 55:11.810]  to be pissed.
[55:12.070 --> 55:12.890]  I did say that.
[55:14.670 --> 55:15.530]  So he did.
[55:15.630 --> 55:21.030]  So he decided that he would mitigate that by if he bumped into you in the airport, he could
[55:21.030 --> 55:24.590]  say that he was on like a climbing trip because he loves climbing for years.
[55:25.110 --> 55:30.850]  So he was sent us a picture of a, of like a climbing bag and a helmet that he was going
[55:30.850 --> 55:31.790]  to take to the airport.
[55:32.170 --> 55:37.630]  It was so crazy that he was just like, Oh, I'm just going to repack all my stuff.
[55:38.010 --> 55:40.290]  And it's like, what do you, what does that mean?
[55:40.350 --> 55:45.570]  And he's like, well, this way, you know, he won't know that I'm going to Vegas.
[55:45.970 --> 55:46.850]  Geoff told us later.
[55:46.870 --> 55:49.590]  He's like, Oh, if I saw Chris at the airport, I would never think he was going to Vegas.
[55:49.590 --> 55:51.490]  No, it crossed my mind in a million years.
[55:51.610 --> 55:54.890]  He could have just been like, he travels for work like 30 months out of the year.
[55:55.230 --> 55:56.750]  He could have just been like, Oh, small world.
[55:56.870 --> 56:00.170]  Yeah, I'm headed to fucking Kuala Lumpur for the weekend or whatever.
[56:00.670 --> 56:01.810]  I'd be like, Oh, cool, man.
[56:01.870 --> 56:02.970]  Well, you know, stay safe.
[56:03.590 --> 56:04.110]  Love you.
[56:04.450 --> 56:05.830]  It was so nice to see Chris.
[56:05.910 --> 56:08.390]  I hadn't seen him in probably five, five years.
[56:08.710 --> 56:08.950]  I love it.
[56:08.970 --> 56:11.030]  Yeah, I love, I never met him.
[56:11.070 --> 56:11.690]  He's a great guy.
[56:12.130 --> 56:13.270]  Yeah, he's the fucking best.
[56:13.450 --> 56:18.410]  I love that you guys all got to experience my favorite thing about him, which is that
[56:18.410 --> 56:20.910]  he's like professionally late to everything.
[56:20.950 --> 56:22.430]  Dude, that was crazy.
[56:23.210 --> 56:25.070]  I don't know how else to describe it.
[56:25.170 --> 56:29.050]  It's like he does it in a way that seems like, Oh, this dude's a pro at being late.
[56:31.490 --> 56:36.210]  It is always in every circumstance he's late and there's always a reason and an excuse
[56:36.210 --> 56:36.890]  that's plausible.
[56:37.190 --> 56:37.870]  It's really impressive.
[56:38.350 --> 56:41.090]  It, uh, he was a very, is a very cool guy.
[56:41.230 --> 56:44.310]  I just never, never met him, never seen him.
[56:44.530 --> 56:45.830]  Had a great weekend with him.
[56:45.830 --> 56:47.310]  You know, he's all like, a lot of fun.
[56:47.310 --> 56:51.890]  I asked him if he's a big gambler and he said, Oh, I forgot my debit card and all my cash.
[56:52.850 --> 56:54.870]  Which I found out in the last day.
[56:54.950 --> 56:55.970]  And I was like, God damn it, Chris.
[56:56.130 --> 56:57.710]  I could, here, here's some money, man.
[56:57.970 --> 56:59.990]  I just thought he was just quietly not gambling.
[57:00.210 --> 57:01.710]  And not that any of us gambled a lot.
[57:01.810 --> 57:04.850]  We're mostly playing $5 on craps or whatever.
[57:05.450 --> 57:11.050]  But, uh, and I think, I think almost everybody except for Gavin ended about even.
[57:11.350 --> 57:12.110]  I want to say.
[57:12.530 --> 57:13.730]  Yeah, yeah.
[57:14.090 --> 57:15.250]  Gavin ended way down.
[57:15.250 --> 57:16.930]  Yeah, way, way, way down.
[57:17.290 --> 57:17.470]  Sounds like.
[57:17.670 --> 57:23.050]  Uh, I wanted to send a picture real quick of, uh, Chris's repacked bag that he texted us
[57:23.050 --> 57:27.350]  to assure us that there's no way he was getting caught at this airport.
[57:27.730 --> 57:32.870]  Do you think you scared him into that, Gavin, with your text?
[57:33.170 --> 57:34.330]  A hundred percent.
[57:34.650 --> 57:35.870]  Yeah, I hope so.
[57:37.470 --> 57:38.110]  No doubt.
[57:39.710 --> 57:44.190]  Also, it was, um, it was 47 degrees.
[57:44.190 --> 57:46.250]  Yeah, that's Celsius.
[57:47.090 --> 57:47.270]  Yeah.
[57:47.710 --> 57:49.970]  Which means it was way hotter in regular temperature.
[57:49.970 --> 57:52.150]  I think that's like 116 or something.
[57:52.290 --> 57:57.670]  It was, yeah, we, oh, I've been to India in the summer and it was hotter than that in
[57:57.670 --> 57:58.010]  Vegas.
[57:58.450 --> 58:00.050]  I've never experienced heat like that.
[58:00.410 --> 58:04.650]  After we got home, because there's like a text chain that I guess you guys have been
[58:04.650 --> 58:10.230]  on for months that I just, I was just added onto, uh, which is currently called, it changed
[58:10.230 --> 58:12.110]  names constantly, but what is it called right now?
[58:12.110 --> 58:13.630]  Oh, knees patilla.
[58:14.170 --> 58:15.030]  Knees patilla.
[58:15.470 --> 58:16.170]  That's another one.
[58:16.650 --> 58:17.550]  Oh my God.
[58:18.930 --> 58:23.830]  Uh, well, cause the only thing we had to bring on the trip was, uh, some like jeans and a
[58:23.830 --> 58:27.790]  smart-ish shirt because of the restaurant and Jack forgot his jeans.
[58:28.190 --> 58:31.170]  So he was wearing shorts and Kent called him knees patilla.
[58:31.570 --> 58:31.770]  Yeah.
[58:31.870 --> 58:37.130]  But I will say that he looked, he was better dressed than Gavin was, even with his shorts.
[58:37.310 --> 58:40.570]  Where's the photo you guys took of Jack with his fucking, he looks like a giant.
[58:40.570 --> 58:42.150]  Oh yeah, do you have that Gavin?
[58:42.450 --> 58:42.610]  Yeah.
[58:42.710 --> 58:47.150]  For some reason, like I crouched a little bit and also I switched to the, uh, the 0.5
[58:47.150 --> 58:47.390]  lens.
[58:47.590 --> 58:50.410]  It may, it made him look like he was completely ginormous.
[58:50.490 --> 58:50.930]  Oh, it's.
[58:52.310 --> 58:52.670]  Yeah.
[58:52.710 --> 58:55.470]  You know, a DNG file, the regular file that we all use.
[58:55.490 --> 58:57.030]  You uploaded your dong file.
[58:59.150 --> 58:59.510]  Okay.
[58:59.510 --> 59:00.570]  Well, that's not a real image.
[59:00.610 --> 59:02.310]  Apparently that's a DNG.
[59:03.070 --> 59:03.430]  Yeah.
[59:04.330 --> 59:06.690]  You needed a DNG to capture the size of Jack.
[59:07.030 --> 59:07.210]  Yeah.
[59:07.310 --> 59:08.750]  You need a whole new format.
[59:08.890 --> 59:09.810]  Breaking screenshot.
[59:09.810 --> 59:11.270]  While he's doing that.
[59:11.770 --> 59:19.650]  Uh, so we, right when we got home, Kent, like the next day Kent sent a TikTok that was about
[59:19.650 --> 59:26.890]  a Delta, I think Delta Airlines flight that was going from Vegas that weekend to Arizona
[59:26.890 --> 59:27.950]  where it was.
[59:28.110 --> 59:29.050]  So there's Nees Petillo.
[59:29.490 --> 59:31.450]  That's how he showed up at the fancy restaurant.
[59:31.590 --> 59:32.510]  Nees Petillo was so tall.
[59:32.930 --> 59:34.190]  Why is Nees Petillo so tall?
[59:34.190 --> 59:38.790]  It looks like that scene in Willy Wonka where he's walking down the hallway to the tiny door.
[59:40.150 --> 59:43.930]  Apparently it was so hot in the plane while they were waiting for it to take off.
[59:44.050 --> 59:46.290]  A bunch of people passed out and shit themselves.
[59:46.410 --> 59:47.490]  Oh my God.
[59:47.510 --> 59:48.710]  Oh my God.
[59:48.870 --> 59:50.070]  Eric, you didn't see that.
[59:50.130 --> 59:56.470]  It was like the remembrance of that could have been us.
[59:56.770 --> 59:57.550]  That could have been us.
[59:57.570 --> 59:58.490]  Oh, fuck, dude.
[59:58.890 --> 59:59.210]  Fuck.
[59:59.590 --> 01:00:01.150]  I didn't realize that was a heat based thing.
[01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:02.190]  I thought you would just pass.
[01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:04.310]  I didn't realize shitting your pants was a part of that.
[01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:06.990]  I think they said at least five people shit themselves.
[01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:09.010]  That's crazy, I wonder why.
[01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:09.730]  So many.
[01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:11.290]  People shit themselves in the cold.
[01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:14.090]  I tell you what, though, that's a great excuse from here on out.
[01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:16.810]  That's true.
[01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:22.090]  Dude, speaking of Geoff shitting himself, he was ripping farts at the basketball game.
[01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:24.090]  And you've stopped drinking years ago.
[01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:25.130]  I don't know how you do it.
[01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.150]  Like, I remember your drunk farts.
[01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:29.310]  How do you still have those in the tank?
[01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:32.850]  Hey, man, it turns out it wasn't the alcohol, the magic was in me.
[01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:33.850]  Yeah.
[01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:38.570]  No, I mean, you're cursed in that way, right?
[01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:40.670]  Like, you have diverticulitis, you've got a lot going on.
[01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:41.590]  Yeah, I've been in bed all week.
[01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:42.730]  This is my first day out of bed, actually.
[01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:43.230]  Diverticulitis.
[01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:45.850]  The second I got home from Vegas, I got hit with it.
[01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:48.190]  Like, the worst it's been in like three years.
[01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:49.270]  It's okay, though, I'm fine now.
[01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:53.550]  Yeah, so the next day we went to the MB...
[01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:54.010]  How did it start?
[01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:59.370]  Oh, it started with breakfast, where Chris got lost in another hotel.
[01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:00.690]  He went to another hotel!
[01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:01.890]  What?
[01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:05.010]  Wait, what? Like, he...
[01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:05.450]  What?
[01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:07.270]  The hotels are connected?
[01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:09.670]  Well, he walked out of a hotel to a different one for breakfast.
[01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:10.670]  Oh.
[01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:13.410]  So he was 20 minutes late that time.
[01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:17.050]  Which, by the way, I'd like to point out, he sounds like a goddamn idiot.
[01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:20.630]  My cousin is incredibly smart and incredibly successful.
[01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:22.430]  Way more successful than I am.
[01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:24.490]  We look like shit.
[01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:28.410]  He's so put together, you would never guess that he's the late one.
[01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:30.690]  Oh my god.
[01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:35.650]  He's like one of those people you see on TV that you're like, man, life's unfair.
[01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:36.450]  Yeah.
[01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:37.190]  He's got it all.
[01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:40.330]  It's weird, he seems disciplined, except when it comes to time.
[01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:44.210]  Yeah, I mean, everybody's gotta have like one chink in their armor, I guess, right?
[01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:45.090]  Yep, yep.
[01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:50.950]  So we had breakfast, and then we all went to NBA Summer League.
[01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:52.670]  And...
[01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:53.610]  What did you see? What games?
[01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:55.830]  How many games did we see?
[01:01:56.010 --> 01:01:57.150]  We watched three games.
[01:01:57.150 --> 01:02:00.750]  We saw the Timberwolves and I think the Mavs play at the start.
[01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:02.030]  Then we saw...
[01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:05.610]  Who did we see next?
[01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:09.390]  No, is it back-to-back-to-back games, or how does that work?
[01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:12.090]  They don't even wait until they're off the fucking court, dude.
[01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:14.010]  It's awesome.
[01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:14.830]  It was wild.
[01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:18.470]  It's so fucking awesome how quickly they cycle them through.
[01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:18.970]  Yeah.
[01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:20.590]  Okay, that was the...
[01:02:24.130 --> 01:02:26.830]  And there's no difference to the rules for the Summer League.
[01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.910]  It's shorter, it's shorter.
[01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:30.570]  Is that 10-minute quarters?
[01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:31.830]  Yeah, 10-minute quarters.
[01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:34.650]  We saw Charlotte against Minnesota.
[01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:37.070]  We saw the Bucks against the Kings.
[01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.230]  And then we watched the Celtics against the Magic.
[01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:45.890]  We did not stay for the Grizzlies and the Suns, because why would we do that?
[01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:47.310]  Yeah, we were just done at that point.
[01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.310]  Three straight NBA games was fucking awesome.
[01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:52.070]  The arena, the Thomas and Max Center was fucking awesome.
[01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:55.530]  Eric and I ran into a bunch of community members out there.
[01:02:56.090 --> 01:03:02.890]  We saw some massive fucking dudes who play college football at...
[01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:04.730]  I want to say Washington State, is that right?
[01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:05.590]  I thought it was like Colorado.
[01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:06.890]  I thought it was Washington.
[01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:09.090]  Number 80 and 8, right? Or 8 and 80.
[01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:13.890]  And they have a podcast they do about mental health and sports called Elevate Podcast, I think.
[01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:15.890]  But they were really fucking nice.
[01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:19.510]  And it was like shaking Andre the Giant's hand when I...
[01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:20.810]  I felt so tiny.
[01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:23.210]  And...
[01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:24.390]  How did Jack feel?
[01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:26.030]  How did new Jack feel?
[01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:28.690]  I don't know. He was somewhere playing craps in the bathroom.
[01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:31.890]  That dude, like...
[01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:35.730]  He likes Vegas.
[01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:38.570]  He likes gambling in a way that like...
[01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:42.130]  I mean, Jack's very responsible and stuff, but he should never move there.
[01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:42.670]  That's all I'll say.
[01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:49.950]  He likes finding the cheapest table to play the game at.
[01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:51.050]  Ridiculous.
[01:03:51.550 --> 01:03:52.630]  Well, that's a lot safer, isn't it?
[01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:55.230]  Yeah, I think he just likes to play and he doesn't want to gamble a lot of money.
[01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:58.810]  It's like a $5 difference and it like made his day.
[01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.490]  He's like, oh, these are 20.
[01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:04.090]  Oh, it's like a $20 minimum.
[01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:05.130]  And then we go to another place.
[01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:07.050]  He's like, yeah, now we're talking 15.
[01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:08.150]  And it's like, you're...
[01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:10.670]  What are you talking about?
[01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:12.070]  I was...
[01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:14.070]  We played on this craps table where the...
[01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:18.190]  Because it was confusing the hell out of me with the actual real craps table with everyone's chips
[01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:18.950]  all over the place.
[01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:22.370]  And I was just watching Jack losing track of what he had down there.
[01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:27.230]  But then we played one where it was like a digital table, but you could still throw dice on it.
[01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:30.130]  And then you could control all your stuff on a little screen in front of you.
[01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:32.770]  And I was watching Jack on that.
[01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:33.490]  And I was like, you know what?
[01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:35.850]  I can kind of get a handle on this.
[01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:37.190]  I feel like maybe I should jump in.
[01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:41.370]  So I put $20 in and I tried to...
[01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:43.150]  It added credit to the top of the screen.
[01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:47.430]  So I tried to drag money down onto the pass line.
[01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:57.090]  But instead of dragging the 20 onto the pass line, because it was a drag and not a press,
[01:04:57.410 --> 01:05:00.970]  it put $5 on everything along the path I dragged on.
[01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:04.010]  And then it immediately said, bets closed.
[01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:05.130]  I was like, oh shit!
[01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:07.890]  And I had stuff all over the thing.
[01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:11.670]  I had one of them in A, I had some on the field.
[01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:14.230]  I wouldn't be surprised if I had a come bet somehow.
[01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:18.090]  I mean, like, Gavin keeps saying like, oh, the machine did this.
[01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:20.650]  You didn't have to drag anything.
[01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:21.810]  I'd never done it before!
[01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:26.690]  I drug every time and it worked fine.
[01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:30.190]  You, once again, Gavin and Chris could not fucking get it.
[01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:31.730]  Dude, it was immediately...
[01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:34.230]  I didn't realize I had like one second of betting left.
[01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:36.810]  I was just trying to get my shit close to me.
[01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:39.730]  And it just went all over the board and locked me out immediately.
[01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:41.130]  And I just... and Jack just...
[01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:42.910]  Jack almost fell on the floor.
[01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:46.510]  It was just a fun, incompetent time in general.
[01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:48.750]  How did you do? You win that bet?
[01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:51.770]  You must have at least won something in that.
[01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:55.870]  Overall, I think I won like 150 up on craps.
[01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:58.770]  And I used it just to pay Eric back for the meal.
[01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:01.410]  Yeah, so and then you finished up for the weekend then, right?
[01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:03.190]  No!
[01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:06.030]  What happened?
[01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:09.190]  Well, just with all my other roulette losses.
[01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:10.590]  Oh, that was before, okay.
[01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:13.710]  I was gonna say, like, I'm glad you didn't lose more money.
[01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:15.330]  But I wish you could have.
[01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:21.130]  Because you have such a system where you're like 100, win 100, leave.
[01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:26.490]  You're... you almost fucked up like six Vegas trips in one go.
[01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:28.710]  I wish you could have just kept going.
[01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:30.330]  I wish you could have just kept picking colors.
[01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:32.230]  You would have been in your head on the next one.
[01:06:32.310 --> 01:06:33.970]  Like you definitely would have put on green.
[01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:37.690]  I imagine you have two in a row at two separate tables.
[01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:41.030]  I could definitely see why people just lose their entire lives to gambling.
[01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:43.230]  Because you end up looking, I didn't walk this path,
[01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:44.710]  but you end up looking down the path of like,
[01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:48.530]  I should just, I probably should just put 200, you know,
[01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:50.510]  and I won't lose twice and I'll be back where I started.
[01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:55.350]  I didn't do it, but that was like, that was easily a path to be walked.
[01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:57.710]  Yeah, death trying to get back to even.
[01:06:57.950 --> 01:07:00.150]  Not even profit, just back to where you started.
[01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:07.270]  We also caused a security meltdown at the NBA Summer League, unfortunately.
[01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:12.530]  Which just kind of spiraled out of control on us really fast.
[01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.930]  Yeah.
[01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:14.570]  You want to talk about it next episode?
[01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:16.750]  Yeah, I guess we'll talk about it next episode.
[01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:20.130]  Can I have a theory as to what caused the security meltdown?
[01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:20.790]  Yeah, go for it.
[01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:21.330]  Can I make a guess right now?
[01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:23.790]  I know you're at the Summer League.
[01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:25.050]  A lot of NBA players, they're tall.
[01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:25.710]  You expected it.
[01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:27.910]  They've never seen a man taller than Jack in those shorts.
[01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:29.250]  They didn't know what to do.
[01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.710]  Close.
[01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:30.150]  They're concerned.
[01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:30.990]  Very close.
[01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:35.290]  If you want to know what happened to cause a security meltdown
[01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:42.350]  at the NBA Summer League, you'll have to tune into episode 166 of the F*** Face podcast.
[01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:43.350]  Oh my God.
[01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.990]  There you have it.
[01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:47.970]  Our very own Who Shot JR style cliffhanger right here.
[01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:49.650]  Damn.
[01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:51.570]  That was action packed.
[01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:54.110]  I still don't know how long that episode was.
[01:07:56.570 --> 01:08:01.170]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:03.870]  It is 100% the summer of 98.
[01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:05.790]  Let's talk about basketball.
[01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:07.150]  More Vegas discussion.
[01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.130]  The sphere is insane.
[01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:10.430]  Kerpol exists.
[01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:11.950]  Those chips are bonkers.
[01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:14.570]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:17.610]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
