[00:10.300 --> 00:12.960]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:13.240 --> 00:15.860]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always, the other people.
[00:16.340 --> 00:19.700]  This is episode 166. How's everybody doing?
[00:20.180 --> 00:21.260]  Nick, are you a movie guy?
[00:23.400 --> 00:24.460]  You love movies?
[00:25.380 --> 00:27.040]  We had to wait a week for that answer.
[00:27.280 --> 00:29.680]  We did. We had to wait a while. But I got it. I got to the bottom.
[00:29.760 --> 00:31.260]  We were just talking about some of our 98 movies.
[00:31.460 --> 00:32.880]  I was just curious how many people had seen.
[00:33.180 --> 00:34.640]  I wasn't sure if you were a movie guy or not.
[00:34.680 --> 00:35.420]  Big movie guy.
[00:35.580 --> 00:37.940]  I need to look through the list though of all the 98 stuff.
[00:38.240 --> 00:38.660]  Fair enough.
[00:38.660 --> 00:41.740]  Yeah, we found out that I'd seen 10 and Geoff had seen...
[00:42.620 --> 00:43.420]  24, I believe.
[00:43.560 --> 00:43.880]  24.
[00:44.400 --> 00:45.940]  I counted it was like 18 or 19.
[00:46.420 --> 00:46.620]  Wow.
[00:47.300 --> 00:51.240]  Speaking of Summer of 98, I googled Summer of 98 just to see what would come up.
[00:51.520 --> 00:56.400]  There was a book created, written called Summer of 98.
[00:56.720 --> 01:02.040]  When Homers Flew, Records Fell, and Baseball Reclaimed America by Mike Lupica.
[01:02.260 --> 01:07.760]  It was, I guess, about when Mark McGuire and Sammy Soso were having this steroid off to hit the most illegal home runs.
[01:07.760 --> 01:10.620]  Well, have you seen what's happening next year?
[01:11.040 --> 01:11.280]  No.
[01:11.900 --> 01:12.740]  A Creed show.
[01:12.760 --> 01:13.180]  Oh, right.
[01:13.820 --> 01:14.960]  Summer of 99.
[01:15.760 --> 01:17.020]  Creed is doing Summer of 99.
[01:17.780 --> 01:18.060]  Yeah.
[01:18.180 --> 01:19.300]  With three doors down.
[01:19.740 --> 01:20.160]  What?
[01:21.040 --> 01:21.560]  What?
[01:21.560 --> 01:25.460]  So they acknowledge that this is Summer of 98 and they don't want to step on our toes.
[01:25.780 --> 01:28.300]  Ipso facto, vis-a-vis, they must.
[01:28.760 --> 01:30.920]  So does that mean if we...
[01:31.520 --> 01:37.500]  If the Summer of 98 stuff goes well, does that mean that next year we have to do the Summer of 2000?
[01:37.500 --> 01:39.500]  Because the Summer of 99 has been covered?
[01:39.820 --> 01:40.860]  Oh, without trading off?
[01:41.120 --> 01:44.660]  Well, no, because the Summer of 99 will be next... Also, that doesn't make any sense.
[01:44.720 --> 01:46.980]  Why are they doing it in April if it's Summer of 99?
[01:48.120 --> 01:50.400]  Yeah, at least we wait until summer.
[01:50.800 --> 01:51.120]  Yeah.
[01:51.960 --> 02:02.500]  No, I think we still have to cover... I think if we feel good about Summer of 98, again, which I truly do believe is like the last good year, then we got to do Summer of 99.
[02:03.740 --> 02:05.700]  You know what? You're really winning me over.
[02:05.700 --> 02:11.960]  And this realization that 98 was the year Maguire broke the record is pretty crazy. I had forgotten that.
[02:12.080 --> 02:13.720]  And it's the year I got out of the army.
[02:14.480 --> 02:14.620]  Wow.
[02:15.200 --> 02:15.760]  Wow. Good year.
[02:16.300 --> 02:19.040]  Yeah, it was the year I moved back to Austin and met Gus and Bernie.
[02:19.560 --> 02:21.440]  So you take the good with the bad, I guess.
[02:22.500 --> 02:28.120]  We're like firmly out of the steroid era of baseball, right? At this point? Or is it still...
[02:28.120 --> 02:28.340]  Uh...
[02:29.320 --> 02:29.720]  Uh...
[02:29.720 --> 02:33.620]  I mean, we're in the hidden steroid era of baseball. That's what you mean.
[02:33.620 --> 02:37.140]  So if you're a Padres fan, the not-so-hidden era of steroids.
[02:37.400 --> 02:39.500]  He had ringworm or whatever.
[02:40.000 --> 02:41.700]  Yeah. Tainted supplements.
[02:43.480 --> 02:48.780]  I just know like in the NFL, it doesn't happen often, but it's like the tests are so obvious you can work around it.
[02:48.820 --> 02:51.220]  I wasn't sure what like baseball's regulations were.
[02:51.280 --> 02:51.820]  It's the same.
[02:52.160 --> 02:57.700]  What percentage of home run balls do you think are tainted? Are steroid balls?
[02:57.920 --> 03:02.540]  At this point, I don't know if it's a majority, but it's probably got to be pretty close.
[03:02.540 --> 03:04.160]  Has to be a lot, right?
[03:04.480 --> 03:04.600]  Yeah.
[03:05.120 --> 03:10.680]  If you caught like one of Maguire's balls, would that change your opinion on it? Learning?
[03:11.020 --> 03:14.520]  Like post-steroid? Like in a pre-world where people realize.
[03:14.900 --> 03:22.600]  Was it always known? Like how common was the knowledge of steroid usage in baseball during the Maguire record setting?
[03:23.080 --> 03:29.460]  Dude, there was a period in time where Sammy Sosa, Barry Bonds, and Mark Maguire all doubled in size.
[03:29.700 --> 03:29.860]  Yeah.
[03:30.720 --> 03:37.100]  Barry Bonds, from where he ended up to where he started in the league, is a different human being.
[03:37.540 --> 03:37.840]  Yeah.
[03:38.180 --> 03:39.900]  In a way that is like.
[03:40.720 --> 03:42.560]  Hard to understand.
[03:43.100 --> 03:43.940]  Yeah, it's really.
[03:44.220 --> 03:44.600]  Naturally.
[03:45.060 --> 03:54.420]  Really crazy. And I think a lot of it has to do with like his head size. I mean like his head got so big.
[03:55.160 --> 03:56.100]  Oh, wow.
[03:56.100 --> 04:04.320]  Like his head in that first photo is inside of a helmet. The photo of his head in the second part on the right.
[04:04.960 --> 04:08.400]  It looks like he has the helmet on. It's so big.
[04:08.780 --> 04:13.440]  He looks like when Pac-Man would eat the power-up pellet. Like it's larger.
[04:16.980 --> 04:22.600]  I know that like, you know, there's growth and there's time, but it's just like.
[04:22.720 --> 04:23.760]  That is wild.
[04:23.760 --> 04:32.140]  I think it was also very known with guys like Kenseiko and a bunch of that. So like it was a pretty, I would say, open secret.
[04:32.460 --> 04:38.320]  And then I think like the government got involved and that's when it was like, oh, can you believe this?
[04:38.420 --> 04:41.220]  And everyone goes, yes, we believe it.
[04:41.440 --> 04:41.880]  And that's yeah.
[04:42.380 --> 04:49.180]  Like he could be inside of what he became, you know, like in Men in Black where like they reveal like the little alien inside the human.
[04:49.280 --> 04:51.600]  He could just be that. He could just be inside himself.
[04:52.080 --> 04:54.100]  That's crazy. I didn't know how much he doubled.
[04:54.620 --> 04:56.380]  Men in Black, summer of 97.
[04:57.780 --> 04:59.200]  Yeah, should we go forward or backwards?
[04:59.960 --> 05:03.680]  You think we should do 99 or 97 if we like how 98 is?
[05:03.700 --> 05:09.560]  I mean, we could, we don't have to be linear with it. We could pick summer of 2006 if we want to next.
[05:09.920 --> 05:11.400]  That's fair. That's a good point.
[05:11.420 --> 05:19.080]  There's no, I mean, this was summer 98 was an arbitrary, well it wasn't arbitrary, but I mean, it doesn't have any like mathematical tie to 2023.
[05:19.840 --> 05:20.200]  Sure.
[05:20.920 --> 05:23.400]  Summer of 06, I went to ACON in Dallas.
[05:24.500 --> 05:25.620]  Yeah, I was there.
[05:26.220 --> 05:29.340]  I met Chewbacca. I got a picture with him.
[05:29.700 --> 05:30.060]  Really?
[05:30.640 --> 05:30.800]  Yeah.
[05:31.140 --> 05:31.500]  Wow.
[05:31.680 --> 05:32.980]  And it was a real picture too.
[05:33.220 --> 05:34.460]  As opposed to a fake one?
[05:34.820 --> 05:36.320]  Well, they like printed it and gave it to me.
[05:36.940 --> 05:38.900]  Oh, did you have to pay extra for the print?
[05:39.220 --> 05:43.080]  Oh, I'm sure I did. And because of that, I don't know where it is anymore, but it happened.
[05:43.700 --> 05:45.820]  I was about to ask if you still have it, but I guess not.
[05:46.040 --> 05:47.720]  I got it somewhere. I just have no idea where.
[05:48.460 --> 05:56.000]  Oh, man. Hey, I have, I'm looking at the Vegas notes, Gav, and I have one I don't understand. I wrote down Gavin's driver. What does that, does that mean anything to you?
[05:56.880 --> 05:57.680]  My driver.
[05:58.080 --> 05:59.800]  Your Uber driver with Jack.
[06:00.140 --> 06:01.680]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[06:04.100 --> 06:06.480]  We're just very different people, Jack and myself.
[06:06.900 --> 06:07.300]  Ah.
[06:07.780 --> 06:13.100]  He had a conversation with our driver that didn't stop for the entire ride from the airport to the hotel.
[06:13.100 --> 06:17.840]  It was like 25 minutes of just incredibly loud conversation.
[06:18.220 --> 06:19.160]  Did you feel pressure?
[06:19.680 --> 06:25.740]  Yeah, I felt like, oh, now I should be chiming in. But usually I would sit down and be really quiet and be like, yeah, this hotel, thank you.
[06:26.520 --> 06:26.840]  Really?
[06:26.880 --> 06:28.200]  And then not really say anything.
[06:28.960 --> 06:33.140]  In your experience, because you use a lot of Uber drivers, are they typically quiet?
[06:33.740 --> 06:33.920]  Yeah.
[06:33.920 --> 06:34.660]  Really?
[06:36.020 --> 06:48.520]  See, I've had the exact opposite. I've been in and my Uber experience is being in a car and them immediately initiating conversation and then me getting annoyed with the other people in the car with that they're not saying a word.
[06:48.880 --> 06:55.780]  And I'm having to talk to this person for the entire, I'm doing all of the lifting when I don't want to be doing any of it, but nobody else.
[06:55.920 --> 06:56.960]  But do you want to talk?
[06:57.260 --> 06:57.700]  No.
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.020]  Oh, because Jack, Jack was loving it.
[07:00.020 --> 07:14.040]  Or Jack is somewhere in Austin right now telling a story to one of his friends about how he was in this fucking annoying Uber ride with Gavin who wouldn't help out and the Uber driver wouldn't stop talking and Jack had to do all the heavy lifting.
[07:15.180 --> 07:22.440]  Well, the best part is that I heard the conversation multiple times because Jack then retold the things he was talking to the driver about as more people arrived on this trip.
[07:22.840 --> 07:25.560]  So I was really beaten down by it.
[07:25.560 --> 07:29.760]  But yeah, I feel like, I don't know, I just not very, I'm not very chatty.
[07:30.180 --> 07:31.300]  No, yeah, I agree.
[07:31.740 --> 07:34.380]  I'm with you. I don't want to talk to people I know, let alone strangers.
[07:34.700 --> 07:45.000]  So Andrew, Andrew, you're doing something wrong then because you're clearly giving a lot in response to the first few questions that lead them to believe you're a talker.
[07:45.000 --> 07:52.160]  You know, just like some people, maybe it was like Jack was driving, essentially, where some people are talkers in that situation.
[07:52.720 --> 08:00.660]  And I don't, I would rather be uncomfortable talking to them than just like not acknowledging it at all and it turning awkward socially.
[08:01.040 --> 08:09.060]  So I just had to lay on that grenade and I kept waiting for the cavalry to arrive, the four people in the back seat, and nobody said a fucking word.
[08:09.580 --> 08:17.740]  I guess I don't, I don't activate when there's a silence, like I don't see a silence or like a long conversation is like an awkward thing to be filled.
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.560]  I love a group that I could just share a silence with.
[08:20.840 --> 08:22.560]  Oh yeah, it's a great thing.
[08:22.840 --> 08:23.600]  It's like a stronger friendship almost.
[08:24.200 --> 08:31.440]  But it's, it's depending on the person, there might not be an acknowledgement that that was like a choice or decision.
[08:31.700 --> 08:35.440]  They might view that as like, oh, I just had the wrong approach. Let me try this.
[08:35.440 --> 08:36.780]  And then it could spiral.
[08:36.940 --> 08:39.460]  They could just keep on attempting to initiate.
[08:40.160 --> 08:41.440]  And it just awkward.
[08:42.320 --> 08:43.940]  So awkward for me to just think about.
[08:44.420 --> 08:45.700]  It's constant delays.
[08:45.700 --> 08:47.480]  It's just like not continuing that.
[08:47.660 --> 08:48.080]  I hate it.
[08:48.140 --> 08:49.940]  So I'd rather just jump in.
[08:50.340 --> 08:51.640]  I think you secretly love it.
[08:51.900 --> 08:53.540]  But that could just be my anxiety.
[08:53.720 --> 09:00.380]  That could just be me like anticipating that that is a scenario that would happen when in reality, that's never how that's going to play out.
[09:01.680 --> 09:06.620]  We've tested out some silences on this show, and you've been very uncomfortable trying to fill them.
[09:07.180 --> 09:08.640]  I feel like they need to be filled.
[09:09.120 --> 09:09.960]  What, like this silence?
[09:10.820 --> 09:11.220]  Yeah.
[09:11.900 --> 09:12.820]  See, I'm just talking.
[09:12.920 --> 09:13.840]  I don't even have anything to say.
[09:13.880 --> 09:15.060]  I'm just feeling silence right now.
[09:15.220 --> 09:16.240]  That wasn't even a point.
[09:18.000 --> 09:19.840]  But it's also an anxiety thing, maybe.
[09:20.080 --> 09:22.920]  I've been ripping old like home videos.
[09:23.020 --> 09:28.680]  I got a thing that lets me convert it to my computer, which is partially maybe why I had technical difficulties in the last episode.
[09:29.560 --> 09:32.840]  And I'm watching stuff, and I'm fine when I'm like a baby.
[09:33.100 --> 09:35.500]  I'm like watching tapes of me like under the age of one.
[09:35.860 --> 09:45.160]  I was getting anxious watching me at like three and four at Christmas, even though I have no ability to change the convert or not the conversation, but like the acts that are happening.
[09:45.440 --> 09:48.960]  I'm just watching going like fucking don't don't screw up.
[09:49.040 --> 09:50.720]  Like, don't cause a nuisance.
[09:50.840 --> 09:52.060]  Like, don't just relax.
[09:52.160 --> 09:52.660]  Calm down.
[09:52.700 --> 09:54.100]  You don't need to be screaming right now.
[09:54.100 --> 09:54.880]  Why are you screaming?
[09:55.320 --> 09:56.120]  Why are you screaming?
[09:56.540 --> 09:58.020]  Don't grab that kid's toy.
[09:58.020 --> 09:59.620]  Like, don't cause problems.
[09:59.700 --> 10:00.460]  It's terrible.
[10:00.880 --> 10:01.980]  What is wrong with you, me?
[10:02.460 --> 10:03.540]  Yeah, and that's the problem.
[10:03.680 --> 10:09.020]  I know how dumb I was, especially at that age, but I don't remember the actions that I did in that moment.
[10:09.340 --> 10:11.600]  So I'm just watching going like you're a fucking idiot.
[10:11.900 --> 10:13.300]  You're going to cause problems for people.
[10:13.660 --> 10:14.480]  That kid is so excited.
[10:14.480 --> 10:16.040]  Were you worried that you'd topple over?
[10:16.340 --> 10:17.600]  No, I wasn't worried about that.
[10:17.680 --> 10:18.740]  I figured that out later.
[10:19.060 --> 10:19.480]  I do.
[10:19.840 --> 10:21.300]  I need to clip it so badly.
[10:21.300 --> 10:28.040]  There's a shot of me laying down when I'm like seven months old and my fucking nose looks unbreakable even then.
[10:28.420 --> 10:31.720]  Like, it stands out how unbreakable my nose is.
[10:32.820 --> 10:35.640]  Next time we record, I'll see if I can clip that and bring it to the show.
[10:36.060 --> 10:38.020]  But surely a nose that stands out is more breakable.
[10:38.380 --> 10:38.780]  No.
[10:39.160 --> 10:39.740]  Trust me.
[10:39.840 --> 10:41.820]  You're going to look at it and go like, that's solid.
[10:42.160 --> 10:44.340]  It stands out as structurally sound.
[10:44.580 --> 10:44.720]  Yeah.
[10:44.920 --> 10:45.240]  Okay.
[10:45.240 --> 10:51.020]  To be fair, every time I've seen you as a baby, I've been expecting a certain level of it.
[10:51.140 --> 10:53.380]  And then I'm absolutely gobsmacked with the result.
[10:53.560 --> 10:54.380]  So I believe you fully.
[10:55.300 --> 10:57.400]  Do you think that the Vancouver child...
[10:57.400 --> 11:01.100]  Obviously not Andrew because there's no proof that Andrew is the Vancouver child kicker.
[11:01.980 --> 11:06.000]  Just a lot of really heavy substantial evidence and hearsay.
[11:06.860 --> 11:08.300]  Do you think that maybe...
[11:08.300 --> 11:10.280]  I never got into the psychology of the VCK.
[11:10.280 --> 11:18.560]  But do you think it's possible that he or she or they might kick children because they're transcribing videos of themselves as children.
[11:18.740 --> 11:20.940]  And there's a deep-seated self-hatred.
[11:21.160 --> 11:24.980]  And they're not really kicking these strange kids on the street, but they're really kicking themselves.
[11:25.640 --> 11:28.060]  Because they're not small enough to kick anymore.
[11:28.220 --> 11:31.320]  So they have to find some other vessel to kick.
[11:31.660 --> 11:32.240]  Something to think about.
[11:32.760 --> 11:33.080]  Yeah.
[11:33.480 --> 11:38.280]  Would the Vancouver child kicker, if they could go back in time, exclusively kick themselves?
[11:38.280 --> 11:40.600]  But they're limited due to technology.
[11:41.580 --> 11:43.460]  It's like, it'd be like, you know, that whole scenario.
[11:43.600 --> 11:46.020]  Like, if you could go back in time and shoot baby Hitler, would you?
[11:46.180 --> 11:49.800]  It'd be like, if Hitler could go back in time and shoot himself as a baby, would he?
[11:52.860 --> 11:53.580]  Why would he?
[11:55.280 --> 11:56.260]  I don't think he would.
[11:57.740 --> 11:59.360]  I mean, he shot himself later, right?
[12:00.060 --> 12:00.360]  Yeah.
[12:00.560 --> 12:00.860]  Did he?
[12:01.660 --> 12:03.700]  Yeah, he fucking blew his brains out in a bunker.
[12:03.700 --> 12:06.280]  I thought it was a pill. I thought it was a cyanide thing.
[12:06.740 --> 12:07.360]  Oh, was it?
[12:07.360 --> 12:08.380]  I think so.
[12:08.820 --> 12:13.840]  There's always such dilemma with like, would you go back and blow baby Hitler's head off?
[12:15.840 --> 12:17.840]  But I mean, like, why not give it a try?
[12:17.960 --> 12:21.220]  Why wouldn't you do it?
[12:22.180 --> 12:23.480]  Why not give it a try?
[12:23.640 --> 12:25.160]  Yeah, I mean, it couldn't go any worse.
[12:25.160 --> 12:29.800]  Are you saying that there's a large number of people advocating against killing Hitler?
[12:30.140 --> 12:32.520]  Yeah, it's like the whole moral dilemma of the butterfly effect.
[12:32.660 --> 12:35.520]  You could end up with, you know, 16 Hitlers or something.
[12:35.520 --> 12:36.600]  I don't know.
[12:36.600 --> 12:39.600]  But I don't think the phrasing of it, I think, is maybe...
[12:39.600 --> 12:44.080]  I don't think a lot of people are struggling over the choice of should Hitler have died.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.720]  I think there's a consensus on that. Prior to.
[12:49.160 --> 12:51.080]  So you would go back and off little baby?
[12:52.420 --> 12:52.940]  Yeah.
[12:53.100 --> 12:53.600]  If it's Hitler?
[12:53.860 --> 12:54.040]  Yeah.
[12:55.240 --> 12:56.340]  And how are you doing it?
[12:57.180 --> 12:59.700]  Well, I haven't thought about it. Jesus Christ.
[13:00.580 --> 13:02.180]  Nah, he blew his brains out.
[13:02.380 --> 13:02.760]  Really?
[13:03.620 --> 13:05.400]  Yeah, April 30th, 1945.
[13:05.700 --> 13:07.620]  I feel like it's always portrayed in movies and stuff.
[13:07.620 --> 13:09.960]  Blew his shitty racist Hitler little brains out.
[13:10.400 --> 13:11.700]  What a weird conversation.
[13:12.820 --> 13:19.760]  So I think my favorite part of the Vegas trip was that everybody was in bed by midnight every night.
[13:20.140 --> 13:23.300]  I like my friends. My friends also go to bed early.
[13:23.740 --> 13:27.600]  I was a little scared that I would have to be up till like four in the morning trying to keep it all in.
[13:27.680 --> 13:28.460]  And that was not the case.
[13:28.600 --> 13:31.280]  I mean, it didn't help that I woke up at five the first day.
[13:31.280 --> 13:36.840]  I mean, to be fair, that was the case for Jack. He was up gambling till like four a.m. every night.
[13:37.740 --> 13:44.180]  Like Saturday night when we all came home from Meow Wolf and went to bed, he walked down to Treasure Island and gambled for like three more hours.
[13:44.600 --> 13:53.200]  He was mad that we all ended that craps game. I think we were all up and then we just called it a day because it was getting close to 11.30 or something.
[13:53.480 --> 13:57.060]  We went to Celebration Station to gamble or whatever.
[13:57.820 --> 13:59.380]  Yeah, and he was not ready to leave.
[13:59.380 --> 14:02.520]  We just started walking away, just leaving without him.
[14:02.780 --> 14:04.440]  We just backed away slowly.
[14:04.800 --> 14:09.940]  Well, here's why. Because there's this thing you can do in craps where you bet a full line.
[14:10.100 --> 14:22.700]  So you bet that you're going to roll the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 before you roll seven, which insinuates that you're going to be rolling for a long time.
[14:23.100 --> 14:25.560]  So I walked up to Jack and I said, hey, man, everybody's tired.
[14:25.680 --> 14:27.180]  I think we're going to go home now.
[14:27.180 --> 14:29.660]  And Jack said, cool, man. Yeah, I'll join you.
[14:29.860 --> 14:35.100]  And then I watched him hit that and hit all the numbers at once as if to say, I'm going to now do this.
[14:35.540 --> 14:37.260]  And so I just started backing away.
[14:37.520 --> 14:40.620]  And I just went straight. I just I walked all the way outside and just got an Uber.
[14:42.880 --> 14:47.880]  Then he had to run to meet us at the Uber because he crapped out.
[14:49.400 --> 14:55.340]  And then he's like, well, I want to ride back, though, and then had to run to meet us as the car came.
[14:55.340 --> 14:58.540]  And then we had to put seven people in a Uber.
[14:59.020 --> 15:02.820]  That's why I changed the group chat name to Will Knees Patillo make the car in time.
[15:05.620 --> 15:10.920]  But we should because we teased in the last episode, you should talk about the security incident at the basketball game, Geoff.
[15:11.280 --> 15:16.540]  So my my soon to be father in law, Dwight, is kind of like a food explorer.
[15:17.220 --> 15:21.600]  He's like he's like one of those dudes that likes to try out new stuff wherever he goes to.
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.660]  And he always like kind of looks up the cool thing or like the interesting foods and flavors at the place he's going to.
[15:26.720 --> 15:29.560]  He's a lot of fun to go to Italy with because of that. He's very adventurous.
[15:30.360 --> 15:32.840]  And so he discovered this place in Vegas.
[15:32.980 --> 15:35.600]  He's really into birria tacos right now.
[15:35.840 --> 15:37.140]  Like they're like his favorite thing.
[15:37.320 --> 15:45.860]  And he discovered this place in Vegas that sells birria tacos and birria bao buns, which is insane.
[15:46.020 --> 15:47.240]  Now, what is a birria taco?
[15:47.240 --> 15:51.500]  Eric, you can probably explain it better because there you've had them longer.
[15:51.680 --> 15:54.320]  It's like a fried taco, I guess.
[15:54.500 --> 16:00.100]  It's it's a it's a taco, like more of like a I don't want to say like hard shell because it's not necessarily a hard shell.
[16:00.600 --> 16:03.100]  It's just it's a taco, usually with beef.
[16:03.220 --> 16:04.440]  And then you just be into.
[16:04.660 --> 16:08.400]  Yeah, the like shredded cheese because it keeps it all together.
[16:09.500 --> 16:14.640]  And then you dip it into like a lack of a better term, like an au jus or like a stew.
[16:15.620 --> 16:18.320]  And so you're dipping these tacos in and getting a bite.
[16:18.500 --> 16:23.860]  And it has like it's just like so much more flavor because you're getting so much in each bite.
[16:24.220 --> 16:28.500]  Yeah, it's like a cross between a taco and a French dip.
[16:28.800 --> 16:30.000]  Yeah, I'd say that's pretty close.
[16:30.420 --> 16:34.580]  Yeah. And so the idea of like this fusion birria bao bun was pretty fucking exciting.
[16:34.820 --> 16:38.680]  And so we were talking about wanting to figure out a way to go to that restaurant and get them.
[16:39.540 --> 16:44.680]  And because we had this nice little suite area that that y'all set up for whoever.
[16:45.560 --> 16:54.040]  Thank you so much for that, by the way, where we like we're behind the backboard and we had like access to like a table and sofas and like little hot dogs and shit you could have.
[16:54.220 --> 16:56.640]  It was actually kind of like what we did with the Brahma's, but a little nicer.
[16:58.520 --> 17:00.200]  And not that the Brahma's thing wasn't nice.
[17:00.280 --> 17:02.040]  I'm not insinuating that it wasn't. It was just, you know.
[17:04.780 --> 17:11.180]  And so he just asked a lady that was working there who was like, I don't know, getting drinks and stuff.
[17:11.220 --> 17:15.440]  He said, hey, can we bring outside food and drinks in? We probably can't do that, right?
[17:15.520 --> 17:17.340]  And she goes, oh, no, you can here. We don't mind.
[17:17.460 --> 17:19.800]  And he goes, really? And she goes, yeah, it's not a thing here.
[17:20.700 --> 17:23.760]  He goes, she's like, I know most places probably wouldn't let you, but we really don't care.
[17:23.780 --> 17:24.980]  And he's like, oh, OK.
[17:25.520 --> 17:26.860]  Yeah, she was like, stuffed it all the time.
[17:27.220 --> 17:28.100]  Yeah, it's like stuffed it all the time.
[17:28.200 --> 17:30.360]  And so he and I looked at each other and we're like, what do you think?
[17:30.360 --> 17:31.520]  And he's like, I don't know.
[17:31.600 --> 17:32.280]  And I was like, yeah, I don't know.
[17:32.460 --> 17:34.020]  So we asked the second person.
[17:34.080 --> 17:36.160]  And the other person told us the same thing.
[17:36.900 --> 17:38.020]  And so we were like, OK.
[17:38.180 --> 17:42.220]  So I uber-eatsed a bunch of the birria tacos and birria bao buns to us.
[17:42.440 --> 17:44.200]  And then it took like an hour.
[17:44.420 --> 17:50.160]  And then we went and stood outside in 125 degrees in a parking lot and waited for him to show up.
[17:50.520 --> 17:52.020]  Shit myself and passed out.
[17:52.160 --> 17:58.480]  And then when I came back around, we go to walk back in, go to the security entrance.
[17:58.480 --> 18:00.400]  And the guy goes, the fuck do you think you're doing?
[18:00.720 --> 18:01.660]  And we're like, excuse me?
[18:01.780 --> 18:04.240]  And he's like, you can't bring outside food and drinks in here.
[18:04.700 --> 18:06.720]  And he was like aggressively angry at us.
[18:06.880 --> 18:09.780]  And we were like, um, we got permission.
[18:10.060 --> 18:11.220]  And he's like, from who?
[18:11.660 --> 18:13.300]  And we're like, I don't know.
[18:13.540 --> 18:16.420]  The lady that said we could do it and the other guy that said we could do it.
[18:16.460 --> 18:17.600]  And he's like, well, they're not me.
[18:17.940 --> 18:21.120]  And we're like, OK, man, you know, we're not trying to cause a problem here.
[18:21.220 --> 18:22.880]  We just, they said that we could do it.
[18:22.900 --> 18:23.780]  They said it wasn't a big deal.
[18:23.840 --> 18:26.120]  We're in this NBA experience thing over there.
[18:26.220 --> 18:28.140]  And he's like, you can't do it.
[18:28.140 --> 18:31.460]  And he just like kind of just like just like kind of berated us for a minute.
[18:31.840 --> 18:32.780]  And it was kind of annoying.
[18:33.180 --> 18:36.340]  And, you know, Dwight and I are about to go like, OK, man, we'll just eat them outside.
[18:36.460 --> 18:37.680]  Fuck, it's not the end of the world, you know.
[18:38.080 --> 18:38.980]  And the guy goes, you know what?
[18:39.000 --> 18:40.620]  I'm going to let you in this time.
[18:40.920 --> 18:45.980]  And I was like, this will be the only time, you know, we won't be back tomorrow.
[18:47.560 --> 18:52.500]  And so he lets us in and we go and we sit down and we unpack the tacos on the table.
[18:52.960 --> 18:54.440]  And the lady, we start eating them.
[18:54.460 --> 18:57.600]  And two minutes in to eating them, like I've eaten one taco.
[18:57.600 --> 19:03.580]  The lady who told us we could bring them in comes over and goes, you guys have to get rid of those tacos right now.
[19:03.920 --> 19:06.680]  And we're like, what? She's like, they can't be out where people can see them.
[19:06.880 --> 19:07.940]  And we're like, excuse me.
[19:07.960 --> 19:09.320]  She goes, I got in so much trouble.
[19:09.540 --> 19:11.260]  You are not allowed to bring food in here.
[19:11.360 --> 19:12.200]  I was wrong.
[19:12.480 --> 19:13.620]  It's only for staff.
[19:13.960 --> 19:15.100]  They can't be visible.
[19:15.580 --> 19:19.760]  I got to take you guys to a special place to eat them because you can't have them here.
[19:19.900 --> 19:20.580]  And we're like, what?
[19:21.040 --> 19:22.640]  And so we start to package it all up.
[19:22.640 --> 19:25.740]  I've listened to this and I'm just stuffing my fat face.
[19:25.820 --> 19:28.180]  I'm just trying to get it all as much down as possible.
[19:28.660 --> 19:32.240]  And we're like, OK, well, well, can you save our seats?
[19:32.340 --> 19:33.480]  She goes, I can't do that either.
[19:33.660 --> 19:35.260]  If you leave, somebody else can take them.
[19:35.420 --> 19:37.240]  And we're like, because it's in like this little lounge area.
[19:37.280 --> 19:39.960]  And we're like, so I was like, you guys go eat the tacos.
[19:40.320 --> 19:41.240]  I had mine.
[19:41.360 --> 19:42.560]  I'll sit here and hold the space.
[19:42.620 --> 19:44.660]  And so they went and ate the tacos, the rest of the tacos.
[19:44.800 --> 19:45.420]  I only had one.
[19:45.640 --> 19:47.460]  And I just sat there by myself until they came back.
[19:47.960 --> 19:50.320]  Dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen.
[19:51.720 --> 19:57.020]  They like stuffed us in the NBA experience.
[19:57.140 --> 19:59.080]  You're saying like they stuffed us in there?
[19:59.280 --> 20:06.260]  We couldn't even access that area with our like insane seats that were very, very good.
[20:06.520 --> 20:10.680]  The NBA experience thing is like a whole other ticketed thing.
[20:10.940 --> 20:12.620]  And they just locked us back there.
[20:13.040 --> 20:14.520]  And they went, yeah, just be here.
[20:14.660 --> 20:15.260]  You just sit here.
[20:15.420 --> 20:19.980]  There were more people around us in there watching us eat than could see us eating in our seats.
[20:19.980 --> 20:26.960]  And then according to Dwight, y'all just stood over a trash can and stuffed your faces guiltily as quickly as you could.
[20:28.360 --> 20:30.460]  Gavin Stranish sent DONG files.
[20:30.620 --> 20:33.300]  Ah, shit! Why are all my pictures DONGs now?
[20:34.860 --> 20:36.260]  Is this one a DONG?
[20:36.880 --> 20:38.980]  Gavin's files are converting to sleep spaghetti.
[20:39.740 --> 20:40.700]  Ah, shit!
[20:41.560 --> 20:42.420]  This is really cool.
[20:42.680 --> 20:43.680]  People have been complaining.
[20:43.920 --> 20:46.540]  They're like, how come these guys just don't learn how to use Discord already?
[20:46.740 --> 20:49.280]  I fucking hate Discord and I refuse to learn it.
[20:49.280 --> 20:53.040]  It's also the difference between using- we're using it on the desktop and our phones at the same time.
[20:53.120 --> 20:56.600]  And I'm sorry, but uploading just photos on phone to Discord is-
[20:56.600 --> 20:59.380]  Why did you take a picture of the back of me?
[20:59.840 --> 21:03.980]  You were really pissed off that the Uber driver was driving away from us instead of picking us up.
[21:04.280 --> 21:08.280]  And it was 47 degrees and I just thought that was the perfect pose.
[21:08.280 --> 21:13.120]  This fucking woman refused to drive over to the pickup area.
[21:13.620 --> 21:15.520]  And like, would not do it.
[21:15.660 --> 21:16.500]  Drove around in circles.
[21:16.680 --> 21:18.480]  Security is like pointing her in.
[21:18.480 --> 21:21.100]  She is fucking ignoring them.
[21:21.300 --> 21:22.700]  There's no shade.
[21:22.840 --> 21:25.680]  It is 112 degrees.
[21:25.700 --> 21:29.620]  And I'm just standing in a fucking ditch.
[21:29.860 --> 21:33.560]  Surrounded by shrubs going, what the fuck are you doing?
[21:33.880 --> 21:35.780]  What the fuck are you doing?
[21:36.020 --> 21:41.080]  What you can see is that there were about 12 people stood under the shadow of a tree.
[21:41.180 --> 21:42.240]  That's where I'm taking that from.
[21:42.380 --> 21:46.500]  We're all just like shuffling trying to get off the- out of the burning sunlight.
[21:46.900 --> 21:47.360]  Miserable.
[21:48.160 --> 21:48.560]  Miserable.
[21:49.340 --> 21:50.460]  I've got a clip I can show.
[21:51.000 --> 21:51.740]  You have a clip?
[21:52.980 --> 21:53.780]  From Vegas.
[21:54.620 --> 21:57.080]  Let me see if I can share this window.
[21:57.580 --> 22:00.340]  Is it going to be a DONG video? Because I really- I don't-
[22:00.860 --> 22:02.280]  This might be DONG, actually.
[22:03.400 --> 22:08.300]  While you're doing that, I'm going to upload a photo of the- just of the place we were at.
[22:08.480 --> 22:09.540]  Just so Andrew can see.
[22:09.540 --> 22:10.400]  The NBA experience?
[22:10.540 --> 22:10.760]  Yeah.
[22:11.580 --> 22:13.000]  It was- Andrew, it was really cool.
[22:13.520 --> 22:14.400]  It sounds awesome.
[22:14.400 --> 22:14.960]  The summer league was awesome.
[22:15.380 --> 22:16.400]  Oh, wow. What a view.
[22:16.400 --> 22:19.060]  It was unlimited food, unlimited drinks.
[22:19.800 --> 22:21.920]  Like, it was fucking awesome.
[22:22.340 --> 22:24.540]  We just- we posted up. It was great.
[22:24.840 --> 22:29.280]  It was great. You were like having a bunch of beers. I sucked down a couple of Bloody Marys.
[22:29.560 --> 22:31.520]  I had every Diet Coke in the building.
[22:31.680 --> 22:32.980]  Actually, Diet Pepsi. They had Diet Pepsi.
[22:33.360 --> 22:37.180]  Oh, and then this. This is the coolest thing I've ever seen in my fucking life.
[22:37.940 --> 22:38.940]  That's the-
[22:38.940 --> 22:39.680]  Oh, the sphere.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.380]  Yeah, the new Madison Square Garden sphere thing.
[22:42.780 --> 22:43.760]  Holy shit.
[22:43.760 --> 22:52.020]  It was cool twice. Once when it was a basketball and the other time when it was a moon and we were driving back to the strip and it felt like you were on another planet.
[22:52.780 --> 22:55.600]  It looks so cool. Like, the pictures don't do it justice.
[22:55.840 --> 22:56.160]  Insane.
[22:56.180 --> 22:59.600]  I didn't realize how new it was. Like, they've only turned it on in the last month or so.
[22:59.720 --> 23:01.380]  Yeah, I would say it's about three weeks old.
[23:01.380 --> 23:01.540]  Very recent.
[23:01.600 --> 23:02.800]  Maybe a month old at this point.
[23:03.100 --> 23:07.460]  And one of our group asked the driver to go by it so they could see it and apparently it was off.
[23:07.900 --> 23:13.040]  That was me. Dwight and I, we asked the guy, we said, hey, can you drive us by the sphere? We want to see it at night.
[23:13.060 --> 23:14.840]  And he goes, yeah, sure, man. I'll drive you by, no problem.
[23:14.940 --> 23:17.400]  It was on the way back on Saturday night. It's about 11 o'clock at night.
[23:17.600 --> 23:20.080]  So he swings by, drives it back, and it's pitch black. It's off.
[23:20.120 --> 23:23.020]  And we go, oh, it's off. And he goes, oh, yeah, they turn it off at like 9 o'clock now.
[23:23.440 --> 23:25.540]  We're like, you motherfu- Why didn't you fucking tell us that?
[23:27.540 --> 23:29.540]  The moon was the coolest, I think.
[23:29.940 --> 23:35.140]  Yeah, the moon was when we got done with Meow Wolf and we were leaving Area 15, which was very cool.
[23:35.500 --> 23:37.340]  Very cool place. Met a lot of people and everything.
[23:37.340 --> 23:41.320]  Met a lot of cool people there. Met the facilities manager there. That dude was awesome.
[23:41.660 --> 23:48.140]  Really, really cool. And then driving back to the Strip, that thing was lit up so bright as the moon and rotating.
[23:48.660 --> 23:54.800]  It was, it gave you like an uneasy feeling. It was very, very cool.
[23:55.180 --> 23:55.800]  It looked quite real.
[23:56.340 --> 23:58.800]  Did they still have the Gerpel drink at Meow Wolf?
[23:59.020 --> 24:03.620]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I took a picture. I took a picture of these two with the Gerpel drink.
[24:03.780 --> 24:05.120]  I'll drop it in here in just a second.
[24:05.120 --> 24:05.900]  Fantastic.
[24:06.440 --> 24:13.160]  Yeah, Vegas for Geoff's bachelor party. I don't have like enough time in the world to say how much fun I had.
[24:13.300 --> 24:14.380]  It was a blast. Me too, man.
[24:15.620 --> 24:21.160]  Surprising Geoff was so cool. Summer League was so cool. It was, it was just so much fun.
[24:21.280 --> 24:25.700]  The Summer League photo looks like a disheveled version of the end of Ocean's 11.
[24:26.380 --> 24:28.860]  I thought you guys were just like looking out at the table.
[24:29.620 --> 24:33.120]  Look at that photo of Jack with the planet behind him. How cool is that?
[24:33.120 --> 24:39.980]  And then here's, here's these two. They're Gerpin. They got big Gerpin. They had big Gerpel.
[24:40.840 --> 24:41.200]  Whoa!
[24:42.000 --> 24:43.100]  Oh, wow.
[24:46.280 --> 24:47.820]  Okay, so you have a clip, Gavin.
[24:48.060 --> 24:50.380]  Yeah, if you want to see my stream. See it there?
[24:50.540 --> 24:52.340]  Oh, there it is. Okay, here I come. I see the back of Geoff.
[24:52.340 --> 24:53.560]  Oh, fuck you!
[24:53.860 --> 24:55.780]  I merely said to Geoff, uh...
[24:55.780 --> 24:56.320]  Uh oh.
[24:56.960 --> 25:00.520]  I merely said, uh, you and Eric plan this? And Geoff was like, what are you talking about?
[25:00.520 --> 25:02.920]  I was like, uh, your shirt, dude.
[25:03.260 --> 25:04.420]  And then Geoff was on a mission.
[25:08.160 --> 25:09.340]  He's trying to get a peek.
[25:09.560 --> 25:09.920]  Okay.
[25:12.100 --> 25:12.800]  You can't see.
[25:18.580 --> 25:19.740]  Oh, come on!
[25:19.960 --> 25:20.320]  Oh, good change.
[25:22.440 --> 25:23.420]  How did I do this?
[25:23.980 --> 25:25.420]  Yeah, you are. That's what you're doing.
[25:27.620 --> 25:31.220]  Both wearing the bootleg Zimmer RTX shirt.
[25:31.380 --> 25:33.200]  Oh, little face boys.
[25:35.220 --> 25:36.380]  Heading out to Meow Wolf.
[25:36.560 --> 25:38.740]  And they were like, oh, what if this got changed? I was like, absolutely not.
[25:39.080 --> 25:41.460]  Yeah, so nobody changed. So that's good.
[25:42.460 --> 25:45.440]  So that was Eric and I hanging out the rest of the night in the same shirt.
[25:45.900 --> 25:46.300]  Yep.
[25:46.680 --> 25:52.200]  I had a funny realization about RTX, the most recent one that we had.
[25:52.200 --> 25:56.580]  So, like, last year, we sold grown tubes, right?
[25:56.680 --> 26:03.800]  And there were people in the company that complained of, like, why are we giving the people there noise-making devices?
[26:04.100 --> 26:05.240]  That's a terrible idea.
[26:05.820 --> 26:14.440]  I saw a post about how we were, some posted in our subreddit that one of the items we were selling this year for RTX was a pizza cutter.
[26:14.920 --> 26:20.260]  Advising people, if they bought one, you could not carry, like, it could not go in your carry-on.
[26:20.260 --> 26:23.000]  You would have to check that bag to get it.
[26:23.120 --> 26:23.240]  What?
[26:23.360 --> 26:26.160]  Which made me realize how dumb we are.
[26:26.400 --> 26:33.720]  We gave the audience noisemakers, the first RTX we did merch for, we armed the audience for the second RTX we did.
[26:34.280 --> 26:34.960]  We gave them knives.
[26:35.600 --> 26:38.240]  We just sold knives in the middle of the convention center.
[26:38.520 --> 26:40.500]  And there were no complaints about it.
[26:40.720 --> 26:44.120]  But I never thought about it to that point that we just armed everybody.
[26:44.320 --> 26:47.480]  I don't know if you could have entered RTX with a pizza slicer.
[26:47.480 --> 26:50.860]  I was thinking if you walked out, would you be allowed back in with your merch?
[26:50.860 --> 26:54.720]  Yeah, I don't know. I would love to know that. If someone tried to get blocked, that'd be hilarious.
[26:54.980 --> 27:01.400]  I just, I never considered until after the fact that we allowed people to have weapons in the middle of the hall.
[27:01.760 --> 27:03.420]  They would have just peace-bonded it.
[27:05.720 --> 27:09.160]  It's a knife! I'd never even considered it. It's like a sharp thing.
[27:09.260 --> 27:11.300]  Yeah, it's a circular knife.
[27:12.120 --> 27:13.240]  They just spray orange.
[27:16.040 --> 27:18.560]  Maybe next year we'll do a mace or something.
[27:18.560 --> 27:21.560]  Oh, maybe. Yeah. Cool. That's a good idea.
[27:21.980 --> 27:22.680]  Bear spray.
[27:23.420 --> 27:24.740]  A tiny explosive.
[27:28.480 --> 27:30.160]  Geoff, do you have any other Vegas notes?
[27:30.680 --> 27:35.340]  I don't think so. Just that I had the best time of my life and that you all are wonderful and I love you dearly.
[27:35.340 --> 27:37.360]  And it was just a really great, great time.
[27:38.020 --> 27:40.760]  It was totally worth surprising.
[27:40.760 --> 27:45.220]  Oh, I did have, like, I will say, like, I think it was maybe Sunday night.
[27:45.380 --> 27:49.880]  Eric and I were hanging out in the, uh, or maybe Sunday, I guess...
[27:49.880 --> 27:50.120]  Breakfast?
[27:51.040 --> 27:52.660]  It was when you and I were hanging out in the sportsbook.
[27:52.880 --> 27:54.380]  Oh, in the sportsbook. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sunday morning.
[27:54.380 --> 27:59.660]  And we sat down and we talked for maybe an hour and a half about f***face and it was so much fun.
[28:00.080 --> 28:06.260]  We just bounced around ideas and just got so many ideas and came up with a bunch of show concepts.
[28:06.260 --> 28:11.180]  That was a really, like, that was really fun. That period.
[28:11.420 --> 28:12.260]  Oh, it was great. Yeah.
[28:12.360 --> 28:13.100]  Yeah, it really was.
[28:13.520 --> 28:13.720]  Yep.
[28:14.220 --> 28:16.060]  It was just, like, a really focused, relaxed time.
[28:16.400 --> 28:19.920]  And we were just, like, it was one of those moments where, like, just the ideas are flowing, you know?
[28:20.300 --> 28:20.640]  It was cool.
[28:20.660 --> 28:21.900]  Yeah, that's great.
[28:22.860 --> 28:30.020]  We should do a thing, I was thinking, where we just have, like, an idea pitch and make, like, a document of concepts.
[28:30.220 --> 28:30.820]  That's a great idea.
[28:31.320 --> 28:35.360]  Because I feel like we have a lot of things that are, like, kind of in the works maybe in our head.
[28:35.360 --> 28:38.400]  On top of, I think we have content that we've forgotten about.
[28:38.660 --> 28:39.540]  That we just haven't posted.
[28:39.980 --> 28:40.600]  For later.
[28:40.960 --> 28:44.500]  But just, like, we did a Does It Do Season 2 thing.
[28:44.760 --> 28:44.940]  Yeah.
[28:45.040 --> 28:46.300]  That I just, I forgot we did.
[28:46.580 --> 28:48.640]  Well, that has to come out after Does It Do Season 2.
[28:48.660 --> 28:50.100]  Yeah, that has to, absolutely, yeah.
[28:50.200 --> 28:53.480]  But I'm just saying, I forgot that that was even a thing we did until the other day.
[28:54.280 --> 28:55.420]  And I think that's good content.
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.020]  I'm excited about that, actually.
[28:57.100 --> 29:00.420]  And I'm excited, we will get to Does It Do here before too terribly long.
[29:00.540 --> 29:01.900]  I think it's in process now.
[29:03.000 --> 29:04.020]  Is that right, Eric?
[29:04.160 --> 29:07.440]  We'll be filming it by September, October, I think, right?
[29:07.600 --> 29:08.420]  I hope so.
[29:08.580 --> 29:09.200]  Yeah, we'll see.
[29:09.460 --> 29:11.180]  This is a great question for someone else.
[29:11.520 --> 29:12.240]  Okay, fair enough.
[29:13.500 --> 29:15.040]  If it was up to me, we'd do it tomorrow.
[29:15.140 --> 29:15.960]  We have other stuff.
[29:16.200 --> 29:18.360]  You realize that we have, like, Fuck Face Off coming soon.
[29:18.820 --> 29:18.980]  Yeah.
[29:18.980 --> 29:19.680]  We have to do that.
[29:20.460 --> 29:20.960]  That's true.
[29:21.060 --> 29:22.260]  Well, we did some logo work today.
[29:22.320 --> 29:22.660]  That was fun.
[29:23.120 --> 29:23.220]  Yeah.
[29:24.140 --> 29:30.100]  Did you guys see that report that pooping only every three or more days is linked with cognitive decline?
[29:30.580 --> 29:30.900]  No.
[29:30.900 --> 29:31.760]  Yeah.
[29:32.260 --> 29:35.860]  Which, if you think about it, so if you don't shit enough, you get dumber.
[29:36.500 --> 29:36.960]  Okay.
[29:37.080 --> 29:38.010]  So, uh...
[29:38.860 --> 29:40.160]  I gotta be Einstein.
[29:40.920 --> 29:41.180]  Yeah.
[29:41.920 --> 29:43.040]  No, you gotta be up there.
[29:43.100 --> 29:44.900]  I'm shitting four times a day right now.
[29:44.980 --> 29:47.100]  I gotta be the smartest dude on Earth.
[29:47.360 --> 29:48.260]  Here's the thing, though.
[29:48.400 --> 29:55.620]  You binge drank for years, which damaged the brain cells, so maybe you're actually just back at even.
[29:55.620 --> 30:00.220]  Because you're shitting so much, but the alcohol really fucked you.
[30:00.360 --> 30:06.620]  If you didn't go through the alcohol thing, you would be Einstein, and unfortunately, that brought you to our level.
[30:07.000 --> 30:08.840]  Yeah, so now I'm just getting back to normal.
[30:09.380 --> 30:09.800]  Yeah.
[30:10.420 --> 30:12.940]  I'm shitting my way back to average intelligence.
[30:13.400 --> 30:13.880]  Yeah.
[30:14.220 --> 30:14.540]  Okay.
[30:14.800 --> 30:15.380]  I like that.
[30:15.500 --> 30:15.920]  I'll take that.
[30:15.980 --> 30:16.480]  But you know what?
[30:16.580 --> 30:18.660]  You're looking really fucking cool doing it.
[30:18.740 --> 30:19.760]  You got the shades on.
[30:19.860 --> 30:20.680]  You look great.
[30:20.680 --> 30:20.920]  I do.
[30:21.480 --> 30:23.760]  I definitely wear my shit shades every chance I get.
[30:28.520 --> 30:31.320]  The best way to learn a language is through immersion.
[30:31.680 --> 30:34.620]  Living where the language is spoken natively and using it every day.
[30:34.780 --> 30:36.520]  But that's not possible for everyone.
[30:36.880 --> 30:38.900]  So what's the second best way to learn a language?
[30:39.320 --> 30:39.660]  Babbel.
[30:39.980 --> 30:44.160]  Because with Babbel, you can start speaking a new language in just three weeks.
[30:44.740 --> 30:47.360]  This summer, you can start speaking a new language with Babbel.
[30:47.780 --> 30:48.480]  Why Babbel?
[30:48.780 --> 30:49.840]  Because it works.
[30:50.240 --> 30:55.420]  Instead of paying hundreds of dollars for a private tutor or fooling yourself with language apps that are little more than games,
[30:55.420 --> 31:03.760]  Babbel's quick 10-minute lessons are designed by over 150 language experts to help you start speaking a new language in as little as three weeks.
[31:04.280 --> 31:06.800]  Babbel is designed by real people for real conversations.
[31:07.120 --> 31:15.360]  All of Babbel's tips and tools for learning a new language are approachable, accessible, rooted in real-life situations, and delivered with conversation-based teaching.
[31:15.900 --> 31:20.020]  They have such convenient courses that help you learn real-life conversation skills.
[31:20.160 --> 31:21.240]  The things that really matter.
[31:21.240 --> 31:31.100]  So it's easy to pick up on things like how to order food or ask for directions, speaking to merchants, without having to consult language apps while on vacation, which is something that nobody wants to do.
[31:31.580 --> 31:36.580]  Plus, Babbel's speech recognition technology helps you to improve your pronunciation and accent.
[31:37.000 --> 31:40.220]  If you can't pronounce a word, it's almost like not knowing it at all, in my opinion.
[31:40.500 --> 31:42.820]  It's so important to have those skills.
[31:43.560 --> 31:48.400]  Studies from Yale, Michigan State University, and others continue to prove Babbel is better.
[31:48.400 --> 31:54.480]  For instance, one study found that using Babbel for 15 hours is equivalent to a full semester at college.
[31:54.920 --> 32:00.420]  With over 10 million subscriptions sold, Babbel is real language learning for real conversations.
[32:00.920 --> 32:05.940]  Here's a special, limited-time deal for our listeners to get you started right now.

[32:20.600 --> 32:22.820]  Rules and restrictions may apply.
[32:23.300 --> 32:32.940]  With the busy fall season around, it is so easy to give up on, like, making meals and doing that type of thing, and then you get takeout, and that's not nutritious, that's not ideal.
[32:33.380 --> 32:41.000]  If you're someone who wants to stay on that nutritional path with great meals, let me tell you about Factor, America's number one ready-to-eat meal kit.

[33:39.340 --> 33:48.300]  I'm really glad, Geoff, that you brought up that you were, uh, you're glad that all the other people, all the friends that went to, outside of Jack Vegas thing, in bed early.
[33:48.560 --> 33:54.480]  Cause I've been going through a I'm really fucking boring crisis a little bit. I had that for the first time.
[33:54.500 --> 33:56.520]  Wait, you're saying that you're the most boring of us three?
[33:56.700 --> 34:01.900]  I, oh, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying I'm having a crisis in realizing how boring I am.
[34:01.900 --> 34:10.740]  Which is something, like, I'm aware I'm boring, but then coming to terms with the specifics and the extent to which I'm boring has been alarming.
[34:11.080 --> 34:21.660]  Like, I went into bed early the other night. I, like, crawled into bed at 8.45 and I was so fucking excited to be in bed early because I had time to get cozy and have a good sleep.
[34:22.120 --> 34:28.060]  And, like, since that point, I have been so excited about getting into bed early. It has completely shifted my schedule.
[34:28.060 --> 34:38.840]  I typically would stay up pretty late. Now I'm an early bed guy because it brings me genuine joy anticipating getting comfortable and just having a good sleep.
[34:39.060 --> 34:42.500]  I feel like you've been, you know, you've been sick recently.
[34:42.900 --> 34:50.200]  Yeah, that's true. Yeah. So, like, getting sleep has been an issue, but it's normalizing. But I've just been so excited about it.
[34:50.200 --> 34:58.340]  So maybe you're right. Maybe that will go away. What won't go away is we had a conversation in the past about when our childhood experience died.
[34:58.660 --> 35:06.740]  When we could no longer, you know, I used to pretend that I was a knight on a battlefield fighting guys and, like, with the sword and run around.
[35:06.880 --> 35:10.600]  And then we just couldn't do that anymore. And we lost a part of ourselves.
[35:10.600 --> 35:23.500]  I realized the other night I didn't lose it. It's just really fucking boring now. I lay in bed pretending it's raining. I listen to rain and pretend it's raining outside.
[35:23.660 --> 35:33.920]  And I imagine that. And that is as deep as my imagination now gets as an adult. There are no more battles. There are no more wars. All I do is pretend it's raining outside.
[35:34.060 --> 35:39.700]  I'm imagining weather. I stink. Like, that sucks. That's so fucking boring.
[35:40.180 --> 35:44.820]  Embrace the boring. It's like a warm, boring blanket. I love it.
[35:45.040 --> 35:50.500]  Does it make you feel worse when it's actually raining? Because then technically you're not imagining anything. It's just what's really happening.
[35:51.220 --> 35:57.020]  That would... yeah. I would... I'd be lost if it actually rained. I guess now, like, I'll pay attention to... I don't know what I'll do.
[35:57.080 --> 36:02.460]  Maybe I'll, like, listen to a beautiful warm beach when it's raining outside. Maybe I have to change the weather.
[36:02.720 --> 36:04.200]  What is a beach? Oh, just the sea?
[36:04.200 --> 36:10.260]  Yeah, just, like, an ocean. Like, a wave sound. And, like, I imagine. Because, like, it's not like, you know, when you hear rain.
[36:10.520 --> 36:16.000]  Like, I'm adding my own visuals to what that is. I just do the same for waves, I guess. I don't know. But, yeah.
[36:16.440 --> 36:23.160]  I realize that, like, no, it's not that I've stopped, like, pretending things. I'm just pretending weather now. And that sucks.
[36:26.820 --> 36:28.320]  That's such a sad realization.
[36:29.080 --> 36:36.720]  Yeah, I was... It's, like, bad I couldn't sleep. I was, like, I fucking... I'm boring. I'm so goddamn boring. Pretending weather.
[36:37.120 --> 36:38.400]  I don't know, man. I think it sounds awesome.
[36:40.020 --> 36:43.580]  So, are you bummed when you wake up there? Are you, like, oh, no, I don't get to be comfortable anymore?
[36:45.240 --> 36:50.580]  Um, no, because I get excited about getting comfortable that evening. I immediately...
[36:50.580 --> 36:51.780]  You already look comfortable.
[36:52.540 --> 37:00.120]  Yeah, by 11, I'm fucking excited. I'm going to crawl in the bed. I got my AirPods all charged up because of you, Gavin.
[37:00.200 --> 37:04.280]  I got the cable. I'm all ready to go if I want to get the rain going. I'm situated.
[37:04.860 --> 37:11.540]  We're the complete opposite. I wake up and I'm so excited that there's so much of the day left. And when the day is running out, I'm just like, oh.
[37:11.540 --> 37:21.800]  Well, no, I'm not. Listen, I'm not giving up on the day. I'm excited about the day, but I'm anticipating that late night getting cozy as well. I'm pretty excited about it.
[37:21.800 --> 37:23.560]  Are you thinking about that before breakfast?
[37:27.420 --> 37:34.540]  You know, I'm not a big breakfast guy. I typically will go straight to lunch. So that's a tough...
[37:35.500 --> 37:38.920]  Straight to lunch, then you'll have lunch at like 10 or you just won't eat breakfast?
[37:38.920 --> 37:44.800]  I just won't eat breakfast most of the time. Yeah, because, you know, I wasn't into cereal because I didn't drink milk as a kid.
[37:45.060 --> 37:53.240]  And so it's just like I'm not an eggs guy. So it's like breakfast is not a great meal. I love waffles, but no, that's an anytime food.
[37:53.840 --> 38:05.920]  Getting into bed and laying in bed is so fucking nice and comfortable that I'm like most nights I'm sitting in my living room watching TV and it's like 815 and I'm like, it's too early.
[38:05.920 --> 38:13.120]  And I have to force myself to stay in the living room until 9 so I can just go lay in bed and watch TV for another 45 minutes before I fall asleep.
[38:13.960 --> 38:19.040]  There's nothing better than ending the day in a comfortable horizontal position in your bedroom.
[38:21.180 --> 38:32.740]  And I wake up excited about the day just like Gavin does. I'm excited about every aspect of it from just getting to be alive and to do the day to getting excited to get to be in bed.
[38:34.300 --> 38:42.760]  The only problem with it for me, and it's a time zone issue, I get into bed now at like, let's say 9ish or 930 at the very latest.
[38:42.860 --> 38:49.560]  And I get all cozy, I get all comfortable. And then I'll go through a thing of like, I want to check in on my friends. I want to see how Geoff is doing and Gavin's doing.
[38:49.820 --> 38:57.400]  It's 1130 for you guys. And this is like, it's too late. I'm not going to text you at 1130 at night just to say hi. Like it's past the time.
[38:57.480 --> 38:59.360]  I'll answer you in the morning when I wake up.
[38:59.360 --> 39:07.660]  Because genuinely, I'd say almost every day of the week, I think like, I really want to check in with you guys. It'll be like 845.
[39:08.120 --> 39:10.020]  Are you worried about waking us up?
[39:10.160 --> 39:14.360]  Yeah, I don't want to disturb you in some way. I just feel like there's a cutoff time for like a text.
[39:14.580 --> 39:21.260]  No, there's not a cutoff time for this level of friendship. I may not respond to you, but it won't be because I'm annoyed. It'll just be because I'm sleeping.
[39:21.920 --> 39:26.040]  Yeah, my phone goes do not disturb when I'm charging it, which is pretty much only when I'm asleep.
[39:27.080 --> 39:32.900]  That's great. Does your phone have a night time setting? A dim setting?
[39:33.400 --> 39:33.620]  Yeah.
[39:34.080 --> 39:36.000]  Like where it changes shade for like night?
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.140]  Yeah, it like goes yellowish so it doesn't cause some chemical in your brain.
[39:40.460 --> 39:44.140]  I don't know how to turn that off. So mine just goes from 4am to 4.01am.
[39:46.000 --> 39:47.900]  That's the shortest night in the world.
[39:48.520 --> 39:57.740]  Yeah, well, I don't want it. My screen one night, I don't know how I turned it on. I was like, oh, fuck, my screen is orange. Everything is orange.
[39:58.300 --> 40:01.740]  I couldn't figure out what was going on and then I learned that it was a night time thing.
[40:02.360 --> 40:09.360]  And so I don't know how to turn it off, but I was able to set it to only last one minute where I'm ideally not awake from 4 to 4.01am.
[40:09.560 --> 40:10.900]  So you never benefit from it?
[40:10.900 --> 40:18.100]  I never benefit. Well, I don't think there's a benefit at all for me. I don't need it to be orange. I'll just dim it and I just fall asleep.
[40:18.360 --> 40:21.180]  Well, I think it's like the blueness is what keeps you up.
[40:22.220 --> 40:22.640]  Oh, really?
[40:23.060 --> 40:27.440]  Yeah, so if you're looking at the blue, bluish whites at night.
[40:27.440 --> 40:28.000]  Is that real?
[40:28.440 --> 40:29.100]  I have no idea.
[40:29.700 --> 40:34.740]  Yeah, because I feel like there are glasses, right, that like block the blue. I just assumed all of that is not real.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.100]  Depending on who our sponsor is this week, yes, it is.
[40:37.660 --> 40:38.000]  Okay.
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.020]  Yeah, you can get actually a pair of glasses that work between 4am and 4.01am.
[40:42.760 --> 40:49.140]  I will look into those then. And maybe I will use our promo code depending on what the sponsor is this week and get a great discount.
[40:49.520 --> 40:50.160]  Thank you.
[40:50.680 --> 40:53.600]  Was it annoying, Eric, when I kept ordering everything that you ordered?
[40:54.060 --> 41:01.980]  No, it was just something that I noticed. It just seemed like a thing that you went like, ooh, and me too. And it was very funny.
[41:02.440 --> 41:07.380]  I respect that you didn't feel pressure in that scenario, Eric, because I would start feeling pressure if I were you.
[41:07.380 --> 41:09.240]  I don't give a fuck what Gavin gets. I don't care if he likes it.
[41:09.620 --> 41:15.420]  You see, that's where we differ. I would feel like I gotta bring the bangers out if I know he's copied everything I do.
[41:15.520 --> 41:18.720]  I can't have a weak drink or like food item in the lineup.
[41:18.740 --> 41:26.300]  None of my orders are ever weak to begin with, so I never have any like worry that they're not all bangers.
[41:26.460 --> 41:28.160]  I'm ordering stuff that's good as hell.
[41:28.600 --> 41:31.100]  There are no mid-tier drinks that you sometimes enjoy?
[41:32.000 --> 41:32.700]  Like what?
[41:33.220 --> 41:35.440]  I mean, I didn't follow you with the beers. I went Bloody Mary.
[41:35.800 --> 41:36.180]  Well, yeah.
[41:36.180 --> 41:37.140]  There you go.
[41:37.260 --> 41:42.180]  See, I would have gone the other direction. I would have ordered the grossest fucking thing possible.
[41:42.420 --> 41:44.880]  Try to trick him into like a cement mixer or something.
[41:45.440 --> 41:46.160]  Ooh, what's in that?
[41:47.200 --> 41:53.660]  It's like this drink. It's like milk and something else, and you drink it, and it turns solid in your mouth. It's fucking gross.
[41:53.900 --> 41:55.780]  Somebody gave it to me on my 21st birthday.
[41:56.340 --> 41:58.180]  It's like Baileys and lime juice, isn't it?
[41:58.480 --> 41:59.900]  Yeah, exactly.
[42:00.580 --> 42:01.220]  It's fucking hideous.
[42:01.580 --> 42:02.240]  Do you know about that, Gavin?
[42:02.680 --> 42:03.020]  No.
[42:03.580 --> 42:06.140]  Yeah, do you want to do cement mixers?
[42:07.100 --> 42:09.820]  Yeah, maybe afterwards I can try and stuff it into a glove.
[42:10.280 --> 42:15.560]  It's not enough alcohol to get you drunk, but it will taste bad.
[42:16.140 --> 42:17.940]  Yeah, I would give it a go.
[42:18.380 --> 42:20.060]  Yeah, bad, gross, yuck.
[42:20.380 --> 42:30.320]  Speaking of gross, I had a realization yesterday at the grocery store that I think might lead to... I don't know how, but I think it might lead to benefits for us.
[42:30.320 --> 42:38.660]  I realized in the produce section that there are fruit combinations that nobody has made yet.
[42:38.860 --> 42:39.200]  Okay.
[42:39.600 --> 42:45.280]  Have you ever in your life... like, you're used to it. You see, like, strawberry-mango, cherry-banana, like, whatever.
[42:45.680 --> 42:46.480]  Kiwi-strawberry.
[42:46.640 --> 42:57.660]  Kiwi-strawberry is a great one. You've never seen... and we could invent the drink, the slushy, the candy, whatever it is. You've never seen lemon grape.
[42:58.020 --> 42:59.880]  No. No, I haven't.
[42:59.880 --> 43:00.920]  It doesn't exist.
[43:01.920 --> 43:02.440]  No.
[43:02.940 --> 43:04.460]  Nobody's ever thought to combine it.
[43:05.100 --> 43:05.880]  That's a great...
[43:05.880 --> 43:09.500]  It's like how there's never a bluish-yellow. Like, it just can't happen.
[43:10.020 --> 43:10.240]  Yeah.
[43:10.440 --> 43:10.700]  Yeah.
[43:11.400 --> 43:12.020]  Like, me...
[43:12.020 --> 43:12.840]  Lemon grape.
[43:13.180 --> 43:20.160]  We could... if we can figure out the ratio, we could revolutionize the fruit industry by unleashing lemon grape.
[43:20.780 --> 43:22.740]  Do you think orange-banana is something?
[43:23.340 --> 43:25.800]  Orange-banana could be something. That's kind of like...
[43:25.800 --> 43:27.080]  Sounds like it'd be in some sort of, like, tropical juice.
[43:27.080 --> 43:30.140]  Orange-banana is kind of like... it's kind of like what an Orange Julius is, right?
[43:30.500 --> 43:34.800]  I feel like orange-banana only shows up for the Avengers of Juices.
[43:35.260 --> 43:39.720]  You know, like, where there's, like, seven different fruits in a juice when they do, like, the full mix?
[43:40.200 --> 43:42.540]  There's an orange and a banana, I feel like, on the roster there.
[43:42.700 --> 43:45.380]  But you're never just gonna see the two of them by themselves together.
[43:45.860 --> 43:48.280]  You know what else you'll never see together? Grape-watermelon.
[43:49.480 --> 43:50.020]  Grape-watermelon.
[43:50.020 --> 43:52.980]  I think grape is a hard one to combine with other fruits.
[43:53.000 --> 43:54.180]  Yeah, I think you might be right.
[43:54.400 --> 43:55.260]  We gotta write these down.
[43:55.260 --> 44:03.360]  Lemon is so strong, and grape is so strong, if you can figure out how to make them work together, I bet you could fuckin' disrupt the whole fruit industry.
[44:03.860 --> 44:05.260]  Grape sounds like there's not a lot of...
[44:05.860 --> 44:06.540]  Oh, wow.
[44:06.660 --> 44:07.980]  I'm all about grape-coconut.
[44:08.380 --> 44:13.200]  You think grape might be difficult to work with, it sounds like? They're not collabing with a lot of the other fruits.
[44:13.440 --> 44:15.260]  I think that grape is such a...
[44:16.120 --> 44:19.900]  Oh, see, like, Gracie just dropped a picture. Watermelon-grape juice?
[44:20.220 --> 44:20.800]  I've never.
[44:21.100 --> 44:22.420]  That is crazy.
[44:22.820 --> 44:23.240]  I bet it's good.
[44:23.240 --> 44:24.000]  That is crazy.
[44:24.000 --> 44:24.080]  That is crazy.
[44:24.580 --> 44:25.740]  I bet it's so good.
[44:26.340 --> 44:34.160]  But I guess you could probably do... I'm trying to think of, like, what would go with grape in general. Like, pear would probably do... would go well with grape.
[44:36.760 --> 44:38.280]  Grape-pear, that's interesting.
[44:38.580 --> 44:39.320]  Grape-pear, yeah.
[44:39.400 --> 44:40.120]  Grape-mango.
[44:40.460 --> 44:43.620]  Yeah, like, lemon-grape is such a, you know...
[44:43.620 --> 44:45.920]  You could call grape-mango, you could call it grango.
[44:46.700 --> 44:49.280]  You could, you know what? You could call it grango.
[44:49.500 --> 44:49.940]  Or mangope.
[44:50.980 --> 44:53.840]  No, grango is... you nailed it the first time.
[44:55.480 --> 44:57.840]  I need to get the popsicles out again.
[44:58.140 --> 44:58.280]  Yeah.
[44:59.100 --> 45:03.920]  I think that there might be some lab work that could be done in the next couple weeks.
[45:04.700 --> 45:15.120]  Amongst all of us, really, if we wanted to. Anybody that was so inspired to start thinking about combining non-traditional fruit flavors into ways that might work with us.
[45:15.120 --> 45:23.020]  I mean, Gavin has the glove, I got some spaghetti to work with. This sounds like a perfect lab task for you to take on, Jack.
[45:23.020 --> 45:24.360]  I'm totally fine. I'll take it on by myself, that's fine.
[45:24.840 --> 45:28.880]  I won't be offended if anybody has an idea and tries it out.
[45:29.540 --> 45:31.100]  I'd like to have a monthly lab report.
[45:33.880 --> 45:34.860]  Notes from the lab.
[45:36.040 --> 45:37.160]  F***ing base sciences.
[45:37.780 --> 45:37.980]  Yeah.
[45:39.220 --> 45:41.100]  Alright, well, I'll get on that. Let me write myself a note.
[45:41.620 --> 45:44.100]  Dragon fruit rarely makes it into the flavors, does it?
[45:44.100 --> 45:44.620]  It's true.
[45:44.780 --> 45:45.700]  Even though it's Andrew's pick.
[45:45.940 --> 45:47.500]  Dragon fruit and grape.
[45:47.940 --> 45:58.160]  You know, I'd never had dragon fruit until recently. I had it in a drink. Delicious in a drink. Don't know by itself. Had a real crunch to it, though, that I appreciated.
[45:58.560 --> 46:00.160]  Did you put the dragon fruit in?
[46:00.800 --> 46:06.540]  No, like I ordered a drink that had it, and it was chunks of dragon fruit in the drink.
[46:07.840 --> 46:14.840]  I just got to send myself the best email of my life. The subject line is just, combine fruits in the lab.
[46:16.720 --> 46:17.920]  Why'd you send it as an email?
[46:18.480 --> 46:19.460]  That's how I send myself notes.
[46:20.540 --> 46:21.840]  You can use notes?
[46:22.420 --> 46:32.860]  I do notes for show notes and stuff, but I want to give myself a to-do thing. I email it to myself, and then I keep it bold, and then when I look at my email, I see my to-do list, essentially. Anything that's bold that I need to do.
[46:33.460 --> 46:34.700]  You don't email yourself, Gavin?
[46:34.700 --> 46:40.340]  I email myself documents sometimes, if Google Drive's been a piece of shit and Discord doesn't work.
[46:40.840 --> 46:41.420]  That's fair.
[46:41.580 --> 46:42.840]  But I don't talk to myself on email.
[46:43.300 --> 46:45.180]  I can't believe you can't make Discord work. You suck.
[46:45.940 --> 46:48.180]  Yeah, I'm posting dongs left and right.
[46:49.220 --> 46:55.380]  Why don't you know what bobas are different? Gavin, do you have any notes for our episode recordings?
[46:55.920 --> 46:56.300]  What do you mean?
[46:56.680 --> 47:00.660]  I thought that you had notes that you wanted to get to for the show.
[47:01.820 --> 47:02.600]  For this show?
[47:04.340 --> 47:06.540]  You said that like two episodes ago, right?
[47:07.100 --> 47:07.120]  Yeah.
[47:07.320 --> 47:09.280]  But that was the lab stuff. I think it was the lab.
[47:09.440 --> 47:15.200]  I thought it was lab stuff, but I thought he had Vegas stuff. I thought he had more notes. That's why I asked. I was trying to tee him up.
[47:15.460 --> 47:18.940]  Hey, that's my mistake. I'm sorry. Won't happen again.
[47:19.080 --> 47:21.160]  Is there any Vegas stuff that you didn't cover, Gavin?
[47:21.820 --> 47:25.980]  I've got Geoff's farts. No, I think I've got everything on there.
[47:26.140 --> 47:32.840]  Oh, I don't like the new thing on planes where you can put your phone in the seat in front of you.
[47:33.220 --> 47:35.140]  That's like the standard now instead of having screens.
[47:35.480 --> 47:39.120]  Because the freaking idiot behind me leaves it on vibrate.
[47:39.320 --> 47:42.840]  And he's getting so many messages. It's vibrating my freaking head.
[47:42.940 --> 47:44.700]  And it's not a problem I ever saw coming.
[47:46.220 --> 47:50.200]  We need like a dampened seat because my freaking head's rattling.
[47:50.720 --> 47:52.520]  No, I'm with you now. I didn't understand that.
[47:52.720 --> 47:56.460]  So instead of having pre-built screens, they expect you to clip your phone in.
[47:56.540 --> 47:58.960]  Well, I think that's fine. I mean, that cuts down on weight, I guess.
[47:59.060 --> 48:02.640]  Nobody's watching those screens anymore anyway. Everyone's watching shit on their iPads.
[48:02.660 --> 48:05.180]  I'm a big screen guy. No, I need the screen.
[48:05.220 --> 48:06.820]  No, they're gone, dude. They're out of place.
[48:07.060 --> 48:08.680]  You just connect to the Wi-Fi and it's on your device.
[48:08.700 --> 48:10.840]  No, you don't miss them. You won't miss it. I promise.
[48:10.840 --> 48:12.440]  No, I will. I will miss them.
[48:12.680 --> 48:18.980]  No, it's better. It's better on your phone because that way, you know, if it's on your little table when you eat, crumbs go all over your phone when you're trying to watch Ozark.
[48:21.740 --> 48:24.960]  Wait, that's supposed to make me feel better about this? I don't understand.
[48:27.220 --> 48:31.640]  I just had a built-in screen taken away from me. You said, don't worry, crumbs will fall on your new one.
[48:31.760 --> 48:32.380]  Are you saying because I'm clipping it?
[48:32.380 --> 48:36.040]  Yeah, I was saying why sometimes it sucks when there's no screen and there's no clip.
[48:36.040 --> 48:40.140]  No, but I didn't do that. But I didn't do that to begin with. I would just not. I'd just look out the window.
[48:40.840 --> 48:42.260]  I'm going to be a window guy, guys.
[48:42.260 --> 48:44.400]  Yeah, watch out for turkey sandwiches. That's what I'm saying.
[48:44.840 --> 48:45.320]  I will.
[48:46.080 --> 48:48.060]  You're going to just look out the window?
[48:48.760 --> 48:50.000]  Yeah, as I said.
[48:50.280 --> 48:51.540]  You've got a fucking phone!
[48:53.300 --> 48:59.400]  Dude, some people just stare at the freaking flight map for the whole flight. There's so many people who do that. Have you noticed that?
[48:59.700 --> 49:02.360]  They literally just stare and watch the plane fly over the land.
[49:02.740 --> 49:06.360]  Yeah, by the way, that's a level of boring that we're not going to get to.
[49:06.960 --> 49:08.080]  Oh no, I'm already there.
[49:08.280 --> 49:09.200]  Andrew, you're not there.
[49:09.640 --> 49:11.900]  I dabble in the plane map. I don't mind the plane map.
[49:12.680 --> 49:16.340]  You check in with the plane map, but you're not going to sit there and watch it for the entire film.
[49:16.340 --> 49:19.880]  Well, you're not going to watch it at all because you'd have to navigate to it on your phone and you won't do that.
[49:20.140 --> 49:27.260]  Well, now it's gone. The plane map might as well have never existed in my life if I have to pull it up on a phone to be able to see it.
[49:27.720 --> 49:32.920]  I'm really good at just sitting somewhere and turning my brain off and just looking at nothing.
[49:32.920 --> 49:33.580]  Imagining rain.
[49:34.200 --> 49:38.360]  Yeah, thinking about the rain, thinking about all sorts of things.
[49:38.620 --> 49:40.800]  It's not too silent for you? You don't have to fill the air?
[49:40.800 --> 49:46.660]  No, I don't. I can live in that silence. You and I would be great in an Uber ride. It's complete silence.
[49:46.920 --> 49:49.160]  Well, it sounded like we were once you got pissed off.
[49:49.520 --> 49:51.960]  No, we've never been in an Uber ride together.
[49:51.960 --> 49:52.420]  That's a lie.
[49:52.700 --> 49:55.180]  Dude, watching how hard it was...
[49:55.700 --> 49:59.680]  Caleb drove us. What are you talking about? You don't even remember it.
[50:00.140 --> 50:06.900]  Watching how hard it was for you to sit with the silence earlier when Gavin was testing it, I think you're the Uber driver that doesn't stop talking.
[50:08.240 --> 50:11.080]  No, no, I would be the Uber driver that never talked.
[50:11.600 --> 50:13.500]  This is different. There's different contexts.
[50:13.660 --> 50:16.940]  If we're doing a podcast, then yeah, I feel like I need to fill.
[50:17.240 --> 50:22.800]  I think you'd be like, oh, they're in my car. I want them to have a good time. I want them to know that I'm a friendly Uber driver.
[50:22.940 --> 50:26.260]  I want them to enjoy. I know a lot about the area that we're in. So we're going from point A to B.
[50:26.320 --> 50:30.460]  I'll tell them some of the highlights on the route. And then before you know it, you talk the whole time.
[50:31.160 --> 50:32.680]  And they probably had a lovely time.
[50:33.180 --> 50:37.600]  Yeah, no, no, I wouldn't. I'd be very quiet. I'd be terrified if they initiated.
[50:37.960 --> 50:42.160]  One of my non-Vegas notes was something I think we should get into.
[50:42.300 --> 50:46.460]  You know how software is on the computers and the computer is the hardware?
[50:46.840 --> 50:50.580]  And if you have a device, you update the firmware.
[50:50.580 --> 50:56.120]  I watched a video and I learned about that. They were like using, I don't know what they're doing.
[50:56.280 --> 51:03.300]  They had like neurons. They were using like rat meat to try to try and like play Doom or something.
[51:03.460 --> 51:09.460]  They're like a bunch of like brain matter or something. I don't know what it was, but they were calling it wetware.
[51:09.820 --> 51:14.520]  And I was like, oh, we face needs to get into wetware somehow because I just love that.
[51:15.300 --> 51:16.580]  That's so gross, dude.
[51:16.920 --> 51:21.560]  Well, I like the idea of wetware, but you don't know what it is, is the problem.
[51:23.360 --> 51:35.320]  It seemed to be a bunch of like goo, like cells that they had to feed that would sit on top of like a little circuit board and it would like stimulate different neurons.
[51:35.600 --> 51:39.980]  But it was like, it was like, like an interface that they had to put food on.
[51:40.500 --> 51:43.180]  Oh, because I think it was like rat goo or something.
[51:43.920 --> 51:47.640]  Well, what I can say definitively is shocks will not be wetware.
[51:47.820 --> 51:52.360]  Because you don't want to get them wet. You want to keep them warm, dry.
[51:53.840 --> 51:55.020]  We could do wetware.
[51:55.860 --> 51:57.720]  Yeah, I think it's worth exploring.
[51:57.720 --> 52:01.500]  Not what you're describing, but like we could do a thing called wetware.
[52:03.220 --> 52:06.860]  I don't want anything to do with rat goo or rat brains.
[52:07.040 --> 52:10.600]  Andrew, you don't think you can play Doom with rat flesh?
[52:12.200 --> 52:13.440]  Kind of like you do with grapes.
[52:13.740 --> 52:16.000]  Do I have to show my hands while doing it?
[52:19.100 --> 52:23.100]  You have to use long sticks. You have to show your hands wetware style.
[52:24.740 --> 52:28.080]  Or is that you? I was thinking about that later, Geoff.
[52:28.120 --> 52:34.940]  You once told me that Gavin is always adding one more thing. He's a great one more, like a one addition thing.
[52:34.980 --> 52:36.340]  And that was a classic one more thing.
[52:36.520 --> 52:36.900]  Absolutely.
[52:37.920 --> 52:39.000]  You didn't see that coming?
[52:39.440 --> 52:41.160]  I didn't see you doing a one more thing.
[52:41.160 --> 52:45.580]  I feel like ideas are open to brainstorming up until we're doing them.
[52:46.080 --> 52:48.020]  You can always add shit. You can always adapt.
[52:49.260 --> 52:54.560]  You can. It's just it feels the way you do it feels like that's been in the chamber the whole time.
[52:55.780 --> 52:58.520]  I'll be honest, sometimes it was an assumption from the beginning.
[53:01.880 --> 53:05.020]  Like, of course you would film your hand. It's a funny stick.
[53:05.880 --> 53:10.340]  But it's not a funny stick now. It's just a little stick.
[53:10.340 --> 53:12.440]  It's funny. It'll get funny.
[53:14.600 --> 53:15.920]  It's going to get funny fast.
[53:16.820 --> 53:19.560]  Well, we'll see. See how good I am.
[53:20.700 --> 53:22.780]  How many different sticks is it?
[53:23.160 --> 53:23.600]  Nine.
[53:24.280 --> 53:26.200]  So like nine inches. Each one's an inch.
[53:26.460 --> 53:27.800]  When does it get funny to you?
[53:28.680 --> 53:30.360]  When might the camera come on?
[53:32.600 --> 53:33.480]  I think...
[53:33.480 --> 53:39.980]  Because it sounds like there's a funny window where it's big enough to be funny, but it's not big enough that you have to use your chin and can't film it.
[53:39.980 --> 53:42.480]  One second. Let me grab them.
[53:43.400 --> 53:44.340]  Let me find them.
[53:44.480 --> 53:48.640]  I'll be honest, I think it's funny right now. I'm just trying to figure out when it's funny, but whatever.
[53:48.800 --> 53:55.160]  Let me pull this, because you're asking the Dinklages guy. I don't know measurements very well.
[53:55.900 --> 53:57.480]  So I'm pulling out the sticks.
[53:58.340 --> 54:01.740]  I'd say this one is when it gets funny.
[54:01.960 --> 54:02.860]  I can't see it.
[54:03.160 --> 54:07.260]  I mean, it would be really cool if you were filming your hands while you did this. That's all I'm saying.
[54:08.140 --> 54:11.640]  Fuck, I'd grab the smallest ones. What's the second...
[54:11.640 --> 54:13.560]  So the smallest ones is when it's funny?
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.660]  No, they're just on a controller on the other side of my desk, and I'd use them to measure when it got funny.
[54:21.120 --> 54:22.100]  So I could see the inch.
[54:26.880 --> 54:29.780]  They're not funny, they're just a tool of measurement to find funny.
[54:30.500 --> 54:32.680]  Yes. No, the one-inch ones are not funny.
[54:32.680 --> 54:38.080]  I just want to point out, if you're at home listening to this, and you're going, fuck, I really want to see this, so do we.
[54:40.140 --> 54:41.140]  Welcome to Arnold.
[54:41.280 --> 54:44.640]  Yeah, I didn't realize when I stuffed them into an envelope it'd be the last time I'd ever see them.
[54:46.500 --> 54:47.220]  Six inches.
[54:47.880 --> 54:49.400]  Gets funny at six inches.
[54:50.260 --> 54:50.780]  Six inches.
[54:51.760 --> 54:53.820]  Are you serious? It's funny at least at two.
[54:54.180 --> 54:54.460]  Yeah.
[54:55.340 --> 54:57.760]  Okay. You can maybe sell me at three.
[54:58.240 --> 55:02.220]  Alright, I'll take three. I'll take between three and eight inches.
[55:03.680 --> 55:07.240]  Yeah. Well, you know what, it does get funny. I will admit that.
[55:09.180 --> 55:09.580]  Thanks.
[55:11.000 --> 55:11.820]  Benevolent of you.
[55:12.220 --> 55:15.340]  Yeah. So what works? What's that?
[55:18.840 --> 55:25.640]  Oh, man. I will say, we had a conversation at breakfast that I kind of wanted to get your take on, Andrew, when we were in Vegas.
[55:26.140 --> 55:32.060]  I think maybe Kent, my soon-to-be brother-in-law, brought this up, but do you think you've ever been somebody's last straw?
[55:32.940 --> 55:36.180]  I asked Eric about whether he'd been anyone's last straw.
[55:36.480 --> 55:37.500]  Yeah, that was where it came from.
[55:38.060 --> 55:46.180]  Oh, man. Have I ever been... Have I directly been... Does it count if I'm in the group of people that was someone's last straw?
[55:46.280 --> 55:46.440]  Yeah.
[55:46.440 --> 55:49.380]  Okay. But I didn't do it, right? Does this qualify?
[55:49.380 --> 55:58.080]  I was in... A bunch of me and the neighborhood kids were riding our bikes, and there was a guy that was, like, graveling his house, like, his front yard.
[55:58.440 --> 56:09.140]  And one of the kids decided to use his pile of gravel as a ramp, and so they drove up it, and then, like, rode it back down, and then we rode down the street a little bit.
[56:09.300 --> 56:15.740]  And that was definitely that man's last straw. He did not enjoy it. He had enough.
[56:15.740 --> 56:28.700]  He grouped us all up, and he screamed at us from the top of his lungs. And I just remember him yelling that he was going to blast our ass with a hose so hard it would shave it.
[56:28.880 --> 56:35.760]  And I was just crying, because I was, like, four, and I didn't like loud noises. And this guy is screaming.
[56:36.220 --> 56:41.480]  And I just want to go home, because I would never drive in the guy's gravel pile, but I was part of the group. I was in the bike ride.
[56:41.500 --> 56:43.300]  And you didn't want to get your ass blasted.
[56:43.300 --> 56:47.180]  Yeah, that was definitely that last straw.
[56:47.400 --> 56:55.600]  My cousin once chased me around, and I stood in front of my grandparents' back door, because it was all windows.
[56:55.820 --> 57:01.640]  And I'm like, he's not going to shoot me if I stand in front of all the windows. And then, like, the window went PAH! It was a WAH!
[57:01.940 --> 57:06.920]  He shot a rock at me, even though I was in front of the windows, and I heard my grandpa go, like, AHH!
[57:07.500 --> 57:11.880]  And I panicked. I ran. I just ran as far away from the door as I could.
[57:11.880 --> 57:18.600]  And he yelled at my cousin, and then he looked at me, and it's the maddest I'd ever seen him.
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.100]  And I just said, and I didn't do anything! And he yelled back, I KNOW!
[57:23.540 --> 57:27.700]  But he was still just as... that was his last straw.
[57:28.380 --> 57:35.660]  So, well, I don't know if I've ever been anyone's last straw, but I've certainly witnessed people on their last straw.
[57:36.460 --> 57:39.120]  I'll have to think about that. I'm sorry I don't have a better...
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.780]  No, it's okay. It was just thrown at you, you know?
[57:43.340 --> 57:47.300]  Yeah. No, I don't think I have been anyone's last straw.
[57:48.720 --> 57:52.140]  Gavin or Eric, do you guys think you've ever been someone's last straw?
[57:53.640 --> 57:56.360]  I would think probably, I just don't know the situation.
[57:57.200 --> 58:03.340]  But I would assume just through me being myself, yeah, probably.
[58:03.900 --> 58:04.180]  Yeah.
[58:05.140 --> 58:05.580]  Thanks!
[58:07.500 --> 58:08.260]  I agree.
[58:08.740 --> 58:15.800]  Dude, listen, I can't... I'm reasonably certain that there could be a Facebook group of people that I have been their last straw.
[58:16.160 --> 58:22.360]  Like, just in the army alone. Like, the five years that I was in the army, there's probably a dozen people I was their last straw.
[58:23.700 --> 58:24.360]  I was, yeah.
[58:24.760 --> 58:30.140]  I would guess that Eric caused me to walk away from the booth a couple of times at conventions.
[58:30.600 --> 58:31.260]  Oh, probably.
[58:31.260 --> 58:38.520]  It was one of the straws, but it wasn't the last one. It was just, like, the final straw of that day.
[58:38.760 --> 58:40.560]  And then I loaded up with new straws for the next one.
[58:41.160 --> 58:42.880]  Loaded up new straws.
[58:44.680 --> 58:50.960]  I remember the time when I was in high school and my friend Shane and I would sit on his roof and wait till the end of the day when the construction crews would leave.
[58:51.000 --> 58:54.720]  I think I've told this story before. They were building a neighborhood right behind his house.
[58:54.800 --> 59:00.000]  And we would run out there at night and take all the cinder blocks and build a wall leading in, like, at the road going into the neighborhood.
[59:00.000 --> 59:09.120]  So then the night security guard would have to drive in and then take the blocks down and then throw them off on the side of the road so that he could do his, like, do his security patrol.
[59:09.460 --> 59:13.120]  And then after he would leave, we would put him back up and then he would have to come and tear him down.
[59:13.200 --> 59:15.060]  And eventually he just stopped doing the security patrol.
[59:16.020 --> 59:18.320]  We did it to him for, like, two weeks and then he just gave up.
[59:19.600 --> 59:26.420]  I remember deciding that a friendship was over because someone else was the last... he did, like, someone that was the last straw.
[59:26.520 --> 59:30.100]  He was, like, my neighbor when I was growing up and he was really disgusting.
[59:31.000 --> 59:46.700]  He just used to do really gross stuff. And, uh, at one point he was eating a load of bourbon biscuits and, uh, he just put, like, two of them in his mouth and he just kept chewing them and he wouldn't swallow it until it was just a brown liquid and he started gargling with it.
[59:47.680 --> 59:50.340]  And I just immediately thought, I just don't want to be friends with you anymore.
[59:52.860 --> 59:54.640]  And yet here we are.
[59:55.920 --> 01:00:02.480]  He also had, there was a, there was a type of crisp called, uh, it was called skips, which is like a prawn flavored crisp.
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:05.840]  And he used to pour milk in the bag and eat them with a spoon and it would slop.
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.160]  I think, I think this guy is the reason why I hate soggy stuff.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:18.000]  Because I've watched, like, wet skips flop off his spoon back into the bag while he had a mouthful of gargled bourbons. Horrible.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.760]  Nick's right. That's the origin of your issue.
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:21.820]  I think it is.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.140]  You've gotten to the bottom of it.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:29.580]  Do you think if you could go find that guy and let him know how much that affected you, you could reclaim wet bread?
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.820]  I'm friends with him on Facebook.
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:39.360]  You gotta tell him. It's the only way you can, it's the only way you can ever eat French dip soup.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.420]  Or what is it called? French onion soup. That's it.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.100]  Yeah. French onion.
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:45.880]  Well, a French dip is a thing, isn't it?
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:46.340]  That's true.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:54.820]  I just remembered that I was my grandma's last straw twice. And it was both, both fair related occurrences.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:01:05.300]  One, one was she took my cousins and I, and my cousins were more aligned with Geoff, I would say, and causing mischief.
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:09.840]  And I was just trying to be good, but they were just monsters the entire trip.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:13.940]  And we had to go to Vancouver, so like get on a boat and then go across.
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.640]  And they were just fucking up everything the entire trip.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.020]  And it was burning her out.
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:23.880]  And then on the way, on the way back on the ferry ride, there was a gift shop and I had money left over.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.560]  I didn't spend all my money when I was at the fair.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.000]  I'm like maybe, I don't know, seven.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.040]  And I was looking around the gift shop and they had a pocket knife.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.880]  They had a little pocket knife and I bought it.
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:39.520]  And she viewed that as me buying a blade, much like our pizza slicer.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.540]  And she was so mad at me that I bought a knife on the boat.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.880]  And she just yelled at all three of us, nobody move.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.120]  And we weren't allowed to move or talk the rest of the trip on the way back.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.620]  That was that.
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.200]  That was definitely her last straw.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.820]  She tried to put real life on pause.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.140]  She did, yeah.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.700]  She put real life on pause and it was like a thing of like, do I give back the pocket knife?
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.280]  Like it was, it was a whole thing.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.540]  And then another time after that, she didn't bring them back.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.660]  It was my different cousin and I, they were, they were banned.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.300]  She was never going to go on a trip with them again.
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:16.180]  So it was my other cousin who was, who was not as rambunctious.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:24.620]  And you know that ride that's like a UFO and it spins you and like you go up the wall, you're like gravity or whatever.
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:25.860]  Yeah, the gravitron.
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.620]  I did that like four times in a row.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:34.780]  And then I realized that the stamp that was on my hand, like it got removed in that process.
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.820]  And that's so like you'd go on rides, but I was kind of done with the day.
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:40.480]  And I pointed out like, oh, my stamp is gone.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:44.940]  And my grandma interpreted that as like me wanting another stamp so I could go on rides.
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:47.880]  And it's the middle of summer, so it's super hot.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.800]  And we're walking around and we go to the first place to get a stamp and they didn't have any.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.100]  And then we went to a second booth across the park and their ink was out.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.260]  So then we had to go to a third booth across the park.
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:02.120]  And I finally got my hand restamped.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.440]  And she's like, well, what ride do you want to go on now?
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.620]  And I said, I don't want, I'm good.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.500]  Like, I'm ready to go.
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:07.900]  I don't want to go on anymore.
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:11.400]  And she just yelled like, why did we do all that?
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.500]  What was the point of any of that?
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.080]  And I never, I was like, I never said I wanted to.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.080]  I thought like I was doing this because I thought you wanted to.
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.140]  And that was, that was that.
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.020]  She was done.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:24.880]  She was fed up.
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:26.500]  That was the last time we went to the fair.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.560]  I went two years in a row, never again.
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:34.000]  Speaking of what was the point of any of that and being done.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:38.940]  This seems like a great place to end episode 166.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:45.600]  And like Andrew's grandma, I'm sure you yourself are wondering, what was the point of the last hour or so of my life?
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.200]  Uh, I don't know.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.180]  I don't know.
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.680]  Maybe you'll come in, you'll tune in next week to find out.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:51.420]  We'll see.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.480]  Can I ask one question before we go?
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:53.820]  Please do.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:57.200]  Did y'all know that Oppenheimer made the atomic bomb?
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:57.900]  Yeah.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.600]  Before the movie came out?
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.980]  How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.300]  I, okay.
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:05.320]  I don't even know what that is.
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.460]  I'm sorry for asking that question.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:08.200]  We should end the episode.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:08.800]  We should end it.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:10.580]  I agree.
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:12.140]  100%.
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:13.100]  Bye.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.380]  I didn't know.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:21.620]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:23.360]  The gang invents a new game.
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.060]  Patton is in the food lab.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.640]  Sleep Spaghetti version 2.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.060]  The most horrible merch is on the way.
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.660]  Brady Dick is looking good.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.280]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.260]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
