[00:10.490 --> 00:12.570]  Who do you think will be here first, Gavin or Andrew?
[00:12.830 --> 00:13.710]  Oh, this is weird.
[00:14.150 --> 00:14.890]  Is he doing a bit?
[00:15.410 --> 00:16.790]  I've been talking to Andrew all day.
[00:17.030 --> 00:17.890]  So I don't know where...
[00:17.890 --> 00:19.830]  We were talking on text 15 minutes ago.
[00:19.970 --> 00:22.530]  So I don't know what that is all about.
[00:22.590 --> 00:23.550]  This is clearly intentional.
[00:24.150 --> 00:25.130]  Clearly, right?
[00:25.470 --> 00:25.590]  Yeah.
[00:26.050 --> 00:29.470]  Maybe he's trying to be more on time than Gavin today.
[00:29.970 --> 00:30.370]  Okay.
[00:30.970 --> 00:32.510]  Since Gavin's always one second early.
[00:32.830 --> 00:33.190]  Okay.
[00:34.070 --> 00:35.210]  Should we like...
[00:35.210 --> 00:36.270]  You want me to like keep an eye on it?
[00:36.330 --> 00:36.810]  Here, hang on.
[00:37.110 --> 00:38.270]  Yeah, we probably should.
[00:38.510 --> 00:39.190]  Okay, hang on.
[00:39.950 --> 00:41.050]  What a weird pleasantry.
[00:41.170 --> 00:42.430]  I mean, not that it's a bad pleasantry.
[00:42.550 --> 00:42.950]  No, I understand.
[00:42.950 --> 00:44.750]  But has it ever been the three of us as pleasantries?
[00:44.750 --> 00:45.310]  No, no.
[00:45.390 --> 00:47.070]  It was weird when it was just me and you.
[00:47.390 --> 00:48.470]  All right, there's the time.
[00:48.570 --> 00:49.130]  You can see that?
[00:49.830 --> 00:50.070]  Yeah.
[00:50.390 --> 00:51.130]  Okay, just making sure.
[00:52.230 --> 00:53.210]  Okay, so I guess that's...
[00:53.210 --> 00:54.390]  Okay, so I guess there wasn't a bit.
[00:54.790 --> 00:55.090]  Never mind.
[00:55.090 --> 00:55.410]  No, it wasn't.
[00:55.650 --> 00:55.890]  Okay.
[00:56.610 --> 00:57.790]  Okay, then never mind.
[00:58.170 --> 00:58.790]  Never mind, Andrew.
[00:59.030 --> 00:59.770]  Yes, scratch that.
[00:59.790 --> 01:00.170]  Good to see you.
[01:00.550 --> 01:00.710]  What?
[01:01.010 --> 01:01.190]  What?
[01:01.830 --> 01:02.530]  Nothing, we're good.
[01:02.570 --> 01:02.670]  Who?
[01:03.090 --> 01:03.990]  We're good, we're good, good, good.
[01:04.030 --> 01:04.670]  You think I'm bidding?
[01:05.230 --> 01:06.530]  You think I'm doing a bit right now?
[01:06.790 --> 01:07.070]  Uh-oh.
[01:07.450 --> 01:09.710]  We thought you were doing a bit because you weren't showing up.
[01:09.850 --> 01:10.790]  Okay, now here's the thing.
[01:11.910 --> 01:13.390]  I thought you were doing a bit.
[01:13.550 --> 01:15.550]  Then you came in and I thought you were not doing a bit.
[01:15.690 --> 01:17.670]  And then you said, do you think I'm doing a bit right now?
[01:17.730 --> 01:18.990]  So I'm going back to yes.
[01:19.590 --> 01:23.110]  Well, you were trying to cover up what you're talking about.
[01:23.270 --> 01:23.690]  No, we weren't.
[01:24.150 --> 01:24.730]  No, we weren't.
[01:24.930 --> 01:26.330]  We were trying to explain it to you.
[01:26.410 --> 01:27.550]  Yeah, we were trying...
[01:27.550 --> 01:28.630]  In fact, the opposite.
[01:29.210 --> 01:31.450]  You don't know what the fuck you're talking about, actually.
[01:31.550 --> 01:32.170]  I know, I don't.
[01:32.390 --> 01:34.070]  We were trying to guess what you were going to do.
[01:34.070 --> 01:38.410]  And my suggestion was that you were trying to be more on time than Gavin since he's always one second early.
[01:38.670 --> 01:40.330]  No, I was just recording ads.
[01:40.410 --> 01:42.510]  I was trying to get them done before we started.
[01:42.790 --> 01:42.910]  Oh, thank you.
[01:43.730 --> 01:44.430]  He was early again.
[01:44.530 --> 01:46.530]  Welcome to episode 168.
[01:46.690 --> 01:49.290]  Last time we talked about the poop game.
[01:49.370 --> 01:50.550]  We talked about Shitshades again.
[01:50.710 --> 01:51.910]  We talked about the Payton collection.
[01:52.450 --> 01:54.070]  Talked about gems and achievements.
[01:54.430 --> 01:56.430]  Talked about mouth tape food poisoning.
[01:56.790 --> 01:58.390]  Talked about flammable farts.
[01:59.470 --> 02:01.110]  Andrew's realization of seasons.
[02:01.730 --> 02:03.290]  Geoff's morbid American history.
[02:03.290 --> 02:04.970]  And the new flavors taste test.
[02:05.090 --> 02:06.210]  That was all last time.
[02:06.470 --> 02:09.010]  This is episode 168, though, so go ahead.
[02:09.050 --> 02:10.210]  Hello and welcome...
[02:10.210 --> 02:10.850]  God damn it.
[02:11.290 --> 02:12.150]  God damn it.
[02:12.810 --> 02:13.430]  Go ahead.
[02:14.030 --> 02:14.910]  The floor is yours, Geoff.
[02:15.010 --> 02:15.410]  Thank you.
[02:15.790 --> 02:19.410]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[02:19.690 --> 02:20.550]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[02:20.670 --> 02:25.650]  And with me, as always, my two very best friends in the world in no particular order.
[02:25.870 --> 02:27.670]  Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[02:28.130 --> 02:29.250]  Now, fellas...
[02:29.410 --> 02:30.870]  I'd like you to do me a favor there.
[02:30.970 --> 02:33.090]  Please don't tell all my other best friends in the world.
[02:33.090 --> 02:33.690]  I said that.
[02:33.850 --> 02:34.790]  It would make things awkward.
[02:35.230 --> 02:36.750]  No, you just have a bunch of best friends.
[02:36.830 --> 02:38.490]  You just tell every group they're your best friends.
[02:38.490 --> 02:40.710]  Pretty much everybody I've ever met is my best friend.
[02:40.790 --> 02:40.890]  Yeah.
[02:40.950 --> 02:42.810]  Yeah, you got like 35 of them that I've met, I think.
[02:43.050 --> 02:43.230]  No.
[02:43.370 --> 02:43.850]  It's really easy.
[02:43.890 --> 02:44.410]  I have two.
[02:45.270 --> 02:45.590]  Two.
[02:45.970 --> 02:47.170]  And you're the two.
[02:47.630 --> 02:50.630]  I gotta say, I feel pretty good that I'm typically below Gavin.
[02:50.730 --> 02:52.170]  I feel like I got top billing this week.
[02:52.230 --> 02:53.710]  I don't know what I did, but I need to maintain this.
[02:53.710 --> 02:54.810]  Well, there's no particular order.
[02:55.090 --> 02:55.830]  Yeah, there's no particular order.
[02:55.830 --> 02:59.550]  I know, but even when that's said, I'm always as typically Gavin than me.
[02:59.770 --> 03:01.130]  I'm just saying I feel special.
[03:01.490 --> 03:02.390]  I feel lucky today.
[03:02.390 --> 03:05.810]  Can I say something off the jump before we get too far into the podcast?
[03:06.490 --> 03:06.590]  Yeah.
[03:06.590 --> 03:06.890]  Please.
[03:07.230 --> 03:09.930]  I have a bunch of stuff to talk about today,
[03:09.990 --> 03:11.990]  but I have two things I want to make sure we get to.
[03:12.650 --> 03:12.790]  Okay.
[03:13.030 --> 03:14.850]  I solved a long...
[03:14.850 --> 03:18.030]  I think, and I'll have to present the evidence to you guys and see what you think,
[03:18.350 --> 03:23.170]  but I think I solved a long time f*** face mystery.
[03:23.950 --> 03:24.310]  Really?
[03:24.550 --> 03:26.410]  Like from season two or three, maybe.
[03:26.830 --> 03:27.290]  No way.
[03:27.430 --> 03:30.310]  That means nothing to me, but that's long ago, I'm sure.
[03:30.310 --> 03:31.990]  It might cause some frustration.
[03:32.330 --> 03:35.630]  I have a feeling there might be some anger involved.
[03:36.290 --> 03:39.710]  And then the second thing is I haven't been in the lab.
[03:39.830 --> 03:40.990]  I built a new lab.
[03:41.110 --> 03:42.450]  I'm so far in the lab today.
[03:42.550 --> 03:46.190]  I've got so much stuff to talk about and show you guys.
[03:46.710 --> 03:50.790]  In addition to like a dumb story thing I did this morning and yada, yada, yada.
[03:50.950 --> 03:51.990]  So I just want to make sure we get...
[03:51.990 --> 03:53.070]  I'd like to talk about those two things.
[03:53.270 --> 03:54.110]  What do you guys want to talk about?
[03:54.590 --> 03:55.850]  I have, I mean, all sorts of...
[03:55.850 --> 03:58.270]  I have an immediate thing I want to talk to Gavin about.
[03:58.430 --> 03:59.590]  I'm curious about this.
[03:59.590 --> 04:00.930]  I was thinking about this.
[04:01.110 --> 04:05.770]  So we recently, we recorded our Summer of 98 content.
[04:05.910 --> 04:07.450]  We did two pieces of supplemental for it.
[04:08.030 --> 04:10.770]  And I think it was a really great recording, both of them.
[04:10.870 --> 04:11.650]  I had a lot of fun.
[04:11.790 --> 04:13.830]  I walked away from that day like feeling really good.
[04:14.070 --> 04:14.510]  It was a good day.
[04:14.910 --> 04:15.730]  It was a good day.
[04:15.770 --> 04:17.450]  Would you agree that that was a really good day?
[04:17.830 --> 04:21.150]  Yeah, I feel like you're leading it into something that makes it less of a good day.
[04:21.670 --> 04:23.030]  No, it was a great day.
[04:23.090 --> 04:24.630]  I just wanted to make sure we're all on the same page.
[04:25.470 --> 04:27.730]  There was something kind of unique about that day.
[04:27.730 --> 04:30.190]  Do you remember what was unique about it?
[04:30.210 --> 04:32.010]  Anything ringing any bells for you?
[04:32.110 --> 04:32.850]  What about you, Geoff?
[04:33.250 --> 04:34.290]  No, what are you talking about?
[04:34.330 --> 04:36.230]  You don't know what I'm talking about?
[04:36.510 --> 04:37.250]  Can I have a hint?
[04:37.510 --> 04:38.390]  Because I didn't get it.
[04:38.390 --> 04:41.150]  Okay, I'll give you a really on-the-nose hint.
[04:42.090 --> 04:42.570]  Pleasantries.
[04:43.550 --> 04:49.270]  We spent the first 25 minutes of that recording day not recording and just talking.
[04:49.410 --> 04:49.710]  Oh!
[04:50.730 --> 04:51.690]  Has that...
[04:51.690 --> 04:54.030]  Yeah, we didn't immediately record anything.
[04:54.230 --> 04:57.610]  We just hung out for like 30 minutes talking about various things.
[04:57.610 --> 04:58.550]  Having a good time.
[04:58.630 --> 05:00.190]  Then we moved into the recording.
[05:00.690 --> 05:06.810]  I was curious if this experience has changed your view about pleasantries in any way.
[05:06.930 --> 05:08.790]  I didn't notice we were having them.
[05:09.370 --> 05:11.070]  That's how good pleasantries can be.
[05:11.410 --> 05:12.350]  You're not even aware.
[05:12.630 --> 05:14.610]  You had exceptional pleasantries then.
[05:15.030 --> 05:17.030]  Think about all the penguin stuff.
[05:17.510 --> 05:19.990]  Oh, that was great pleasantries.
[05:20.210 --> 05:21.090]  And all that stuff.
[05:21.090 --> 05:24.650]  All that stuff that's never going to air in an episode ever.
[05:24.790 --> 05:25.030]  No.
[05:25.090 --> 05:26.290]  Well, I think it was recorded.
[05:26.290 --> 05:26.970]  It was pleasantries.
[05:27.110 --> 05:28.090]  It was recorded, but you said you didn't want to come out.
[05:28.090 --> 05:28.710]  But it was pleasantries.
[05:29.210 --> 05:33.290]  Well, there was a lot of talk about having sex with penguins, but I mean...
[05:34.470 --> 05:35.470]  A lot of talk.
[05:35.710 --> 05:37.490]  It was a lot of talk from one person.
[05:38.690 --> 05:40.950]  The way you said it was like we all were contributing.
[05:41.170 --> 05:44.250]  I don't know, I feel like I got painted into a corner a little bit.
[05:45.690 --> 05:48.030]  If you got painted in, you were holding the brush.
[05:48.330 --> 05:52.150]  If you got painted into a corner, you tried to fuck a penguin out of it, that's for sure.
[05:54.550 --> 05:55.610]  Anyway, I was just curious.
[05:55.610 --> 06:02.450]  I had the realization after the fact of like, oh, we kind of did pleasantries for like 25 minutes and Gavin seemed to enjoy himself.
[06:02.570 --> 06:03.130]  I loved it.
[06:03.190 --> 06:03.590]  It was great.
[06:04.190 --> 06:04.750]  I had a good time.
[06:05.350 --> 06:05.930]  That's great.
[06:06.230 --> 06:06.990]  That's absolutely great.
[06:07.070 --> 06:07.870]  That's a great point, Andrew.
[06:07.990 --> 06:09.130]  I didn't even think about it.
[06:09.590 --> 06:10.430]  I was the same as Gavin.
[06:10.510 --> 06:11.010]  I didn't even realize.
[06:11.370 --> 06:14.330]  That being said, I'm not opposed to pleasantries, so...
[06:14.330 --> 06:15.150]  No, not at all.
[06:15.390 --> 06:18.630]  I've got a little something just to add to the sort of housekeeping at the beginning of this episode.
[06:18.730 --> 06:18.910]  Hell yeah.
[06:19.930 --> 06:20.830]  It's this clip.
[06:20.870 --> 06:21.130]  Are you ready?
[06:22.110 --> 06:22.430]  Yes.
[06:22.430 --> 06:26.710]  I thought that you had notes that you wanted to get to for the show.
[06:27.710 --> 06:28.550]  For this show?
[06:30.210 --> 06:32.850]  I don't know what's going on.
[06:32.950 --> 06:34.730]  The fart was back in last episode.
[06:37.870 --> 06:39.450]  Episode 166, I think.
[06:39.910 --> 06:47.490]  I don't know if now they're trying to sneak in by me or whether that's an accident or paste again, but this fart is really traveling.
[06:48.110 --> 06:48.990]  It really is.
[06:49.730 --> 06:55.410]  You know, like in an alien movie when it bleeds and it melts through the floor and it goes through several levels?
[06:55.550 --> 06:57.270]  I feel like that's what that fart is doing.
[06:57.430 --> 06:58.330]  It is just penetrating.
[06:58.650 --> 07:02.010]  This fart has gone through 18 decks and it's now on the end of my pen.
[07:02.110 --> 07:03.250]  That's so fucking funny.
[07:03.550 --> 07:05.550]  Nick, did you know about this?
[07:05.890 --> 07:06.970]  I did actually know about this.
[07:07.030 --> 07:08.330]  What was your reaction when it happened?
[07:08.670 --> 07:09.750]  How did you react?
[07:10.410 --> 07:11.450]  It made me jump again.
[07:12.870 --> 07:20.850]  Okay, so Kels, Kelly, who helps edit the show, she was trying to see if she could scare you again.
[07:22.190 --> 07:23.790]  And she succeeded.
[07:24.370 --> 07:25.010]  She nailed it.
[07:25.370 --> 07:29.730]  Would that have been in if I didn't put the note?
[07:30.070 --> 07:31.030]  No, she marked it.
[07:31.490 --> 07:34.270]  It would be funny if she just randomly put it in the timeline.
[07:35.070 --> 07:38.750]  Yeah, I just put a note in the frame.io thing just in case.
[07:38.850 --> 07:40.630]  I just wrote return of the fart.
[07:41.570 --> 07:48.190]  I kind of like the idea, though, of testing Gavin every week and putting in something that shouldn't be there and see if he notices it.
[07:48.270 --> 07:49.950]  And if he doesn't, it just is in the episode.
[07:51.110 --> 07:51.910]  Oh, interesting.
[07:53.370 --> 07:56.150]  Like a test to see if they actually do their homework or whatever.
[07:57.130 --> 07:58.150]  Why is this on me?
[07:58.230 --> 08:00.090]  Why? Anyone else listen to these or what?
[08:01.070 --> 08:02.730]  I feel like that's your role.
[08:02.830 --> 08:03.630]  I do ads.
[08:04.510 --> 08:05.310]  You listen.
[08:05.490 --> 08:06.170]  You give notes.
[08:06.290 --> 08:07.830]  I trust your note giving ability.
[08:07.890 --> 08:09.230]  I don't trust my note giving ability.
[08:09.230 --> 08:10.730]  I go to all the boring meetings.
[08:11.190 --> 08:11.590]  That's true.
[08:12.010 --> 08:14.150]  We all pull our weight in different areas.
[08:15.570 --> 08:16.750]  I feel good about that.
[08:16.910 --> 08:21.130]  I listen to seven or eight people a week tell me about f***face who aren't in f***face.
[08:21.870 --> 08:22.090]  Oh.
[08:23.850 --> 08:24.330]  Yeah.
[08:25.070 --> 08:26.790]  I appreciate that a lot, Geoff.
[08:28.010 --> 08:29.310]  What are some of the highlights?
[08:29.530 --> 08:30.090]  Oh, dude.
[08:30.830 --> 08:32.410]  Maybe we'll do a supplemental someday.
[08:34.750 --> 08:36.190]  Do a sausage talk.
[08:36.850 --> 08:37.610]  Oh, man.
[08:38.030 --> 08:40.990]  A sausage talk about what other people feel about the sausage?
[08:41.290 --> 08:43.430]  About all the great ideas other people have for my thing?
[08:43.590 --> 08:43.730]  Yeah.
[08:47.150 --> 08:48.610]  That's the story of my life.
[08:49.030 --> 08:53.390]  I have a story, but I need to adjust it a little bit.
[08:53.430 --> 08:55.930]  So if someone else wants to take the lead, then I can swing back in.
[08:56.050 --> 08:57.750]  I have an important update.
[08:58.070 --> 09:02.630]  I have a story that has been unfolding for a little over...
[09:02.630 --> 09:04.190]  I'd say like seven or eight months.
[09:04.190 --> 09:06.070]  And it's finally come to a conclusion.
[09:07.070 --> 09:08.850]  Okay. And you need some time to put that together?
[09:09.030 --> 09:12.330]  I need some time to just... because I'm going to share something.
[09:12.490 --> 09:14.310]  And it's the way it's spaced out right now.
[09:14.370 --> 09:15.950]  It would look really ugly in our chat.
[09:16.390 --> 09:16.610]  Okay.
[09:16.750 --> 09:18.750]  So I'm editing that.
[09:18.970 --> 09:22.630]  So, Geoff, do you want to tell us about the lab or a mystery you saw?
[09:22.630 --> 09:24.110]  What do you guys want to do?
[09:24.210 --> 09:25.250]  Where would you like to start?
[09:25.330 --> 09:29.510]  Would you like to start on a positive note with the lab and be kind of fun and irreverent?
[09:29.570 --> 09:33.230]  Or do you want to go potentially down a dark road with the mystery?
[09:33.230 --> 09:35.210]  I want to go down a dark road.
[09:35.310 --> 09:35.590]  Okay.
[09:35.710 --> 09:36.790]  Okay, I was going to say the opposite.
[09:36.950 --> 09:37.190]  Really?
[09:37.330 --> 09:42.870]  I was saying we're in a jolly place now, and then Geoff typically takes the end of an episode down a dark road.
[09:43.390 --> 09:45.490]  But if you want to start dark, let's do it.
[09:45.670 --> 09:47.110]  Let's get it out of the way now, then we'll pull it out.
[09:47.630 --> 09:49.010]  Exactly. That's my thinking.
[09:49.730 --> 09:57.630]  Do you guys remember a very, very, very long time ago when Variety did an article on The Roost?
[09:58.390 --> 09:58.770]  Yes.
[09:58.770 --> 10:06.630]  Almost every production, podcast production, was mentioned except for the most successful production in the company, F*** Face.
[10:06.810 --> 10:11.130]  And we felt it was a blaring, glaring omission.
[10:11.790 --> 10:17.490]  And we tried to get to the bottom of whether it was internal to Rooster Teeth or whether it was external to Variety,
[10:17.990 --> 10:25.710]  who decided to not use us, decided to ignore us and our contributions.
[10:26.250 --> 10:29.130]  And then we got fake mad about it, and then I got really mad about it.
[10:29.730 --> 10:32.910]  Then I realized that getting really mad about it was the whole point of F*** Face,
[10:32.970 --> 10:35.470]  and then I thought that was the funniest thing ever and I made peace with it.
[10:35.930 --> 10:40.810]  Because I realized that F*** Face worked because it made it so successful that I was mad that it was a F*** Face.
[10:42.690 --> 10:47.090]  Well, I stumbled upon something the other day that I think probably answers the question,
[10:47.190 --> 10:48.350]  and I want to see what you guys think.
[10:48.510 --> 10:52.310]  I'm going to throw an image up in the Discord. Are you guys ready for this?
[10:52.650 --> 10:52.970]  Yes.
[10:54.890 --> 10:59.650]  Oh, I saw this as well, and I talked to Gavin about this.
[10:59.810 --> 11:03.690]  I think I know who did it. I think it was Eric goddamn Badour, our producer,
[11:04.130 --> 11:10.430]  who is as seen on FaceJam Mega64 and Wrestling With The Week, but no F*** Face to be found!
[11:13.130 --> 11:16.010]  Cold out, Eric. The one time Eric's quiet.
[11:18.010 --> 11:21.270]  I'm not really mad, but I saw that and I was like, what the f***? Are you f***ing serious?
[11:21.270 --> 11:25.110]  How would you like to be credited? Any particular way you would like to be billed,
[11:25.210 --> 11:28.030]  like filmmaker or internet personality or from Rooster Teeth?
[11:28.330 --> 11:33.750]  I said, I guess, shut up. As seen on FaceJam, F*** Face, Mega64,
[11:34.130 --> 11:36.810]  and famously canceled AEW podcast Wrestling With The Week.
[11:37.250 --> 11:42.150]  If you need to lose the F*** Face one, that's fine. That's the real name of the show,
[11:42.470 --> 11:45.370]  but I understand that people don't want to print that.
[11:45.870 --> 11:50.450]  Local wrestling is not hardcore enough to swear, is what you're telling me.
[11:50.450 --> 11:57.530]  Dudes that hit each other with chairs wrapped in barbed wire are scared to use a potty word.
[11:58.390 --> 12:01.650]  AAPW is a family friendly production, Geoffrey.
[12:02.510 --> 12:05.110]  Don't they put like pins in their faces and shit?
[12:05.610 --> 12:10.050]  I would argue that F*** Face is the most family friendly production you have listed there.
[12:10.110 --> 12:14.370]  It's certainly not Mega64 or FaceJam with Michael Jones.
[12:14.370 --> 12:19.330]  We're like all about building each other up and being nice and sweet.
[12:20.490 --> 12:23.510]  No, no, I agree. Everything you're saying is right.
[12:23.850 --> 12:27.470]  You named the podcast F*** Face.
[12:28.210 --> 12:30.090]  Well, I named it F Star Star K Face.
[12:30.590 --> 12:33.590]  Right, and they didn't want to print that, and I don't blame them.
[12:33.790 --> 12:37.250]  You know what? That's on them. They don't know what the stars are.
[12:37.370 --> 12:39.770]  It could be Fink Face. It could be Fook Face.
[12:39.770 --> 12:43.110]  That's fine. That's also on Variety.
[12:43.390 --> 12:45.310]  It's also on Variety, I guess.
[12:45.470 --> 12:47.350]  I'm just saying. I'm starting to see.
[12:48.570 --> 12:50.710]  What are you starting to see?
[12:51.630 --> 12:52.590]  I'm drawing lines.
[12:53.630 --> 12:55.210]  I'm drawing lines, too.
[12:55.370 --> 13:01.910]  I got a big whiteboard, and I got pictures of motherfuckers all over it, and I'm Pepe Sylvian-ing it all together right now.
[13:02.370 --> 13:08.850]  There's a whole grand conspiracy, and I'm peeling back the layers of the conspiracy onion, and we're gonna get to the bottom of it.
[13:08.850 --> 13:16.470]  The problem with Geoff's whiteboard is wrestlers have like 16 personas, so it's like 5 of the same guys in 16 different outfits.
[13:16.730 --> 13:19.130]  But none of those personas are allowed to swear.
[13:19.970 --> 13:20.210]  No.
[13:20.690 --> 13:25.290]  See, I had a different reaction to this, Geoff. I didn't view this as Eric's fault at all.
[13:25.410 --> 13:29.690]  I thought it was very funny that not even independent wrestling is willing to promote our show.
[13:29.710 --> 13:31.070]  Yep, that's 100% true.
[13:31.070 --> 13:31.970]  That was my takeaway.
[13:32.270 --> 13:34.690]  I put it in the email and said, list it.
[13:35.030 --> 13:37.190]  And then I said, if you can't, I understand.
[13:37.670 --> 13:41.490]  I'll be honest, I feel like you gave them a way too easy out on that.
[13:41.750 --> 13:46.010]  If you'd have just written that without saying, it's okay if you don't print this, it would be on there.
[13:46.290 --> 13:47.210]  No, it wouldn't.
[13:48.410 --> 13:49.850]  There's no way it would be on there.
[13:49.910 --> 13:51.030]  Yeah, I'm with Eric on this.
[13:51.550 --> 13:52.950]  Only one way to find out.
[13:54.150 --> 13:58.250]  Hang on, hang on. Only one way to find out? Is that what you said?
[13:58.610 --> 14:03.030]  Yeah, there was only one way to find out. By not listing it and seeing what happened.
[14:03.470 --> 14:04.770]  By not giving him the out.
[14:04.770 --> 14:13.770]  So next time Eric gets requested to commentate on an independent wrestling show, is it okay if it's this one, Geoff?
[14:13.830 --> 14:14.870]  Or does it have to be different?
[14:15.050 --> 14:15.650]  I don't care.
[14:15.970 --> 14:20.230]  Because they may have already set a precedent of not including it, so I feel like it needs to be different.
[14:20.270 --> 14:23.690]  They may not ask again, because they already have the information. So if it's a different one, I guess.
[14:23.750 --> 14:27.510]  I do love that wrestling won't, but an Apple company will.
[14:29.070 --> 14:34.630]  Cosmic Crisp are more hardcore motherfuckers than a bunch of local wrestlers, apparently.
[14:34.630 --> 14:36.290]  That's what I'm finding out.
[14:36.950 --> 14:42.150]  AAPW is an independent wrestling school in Austin. They asked me to do commentary for their show.
[14:42.550 --> 14:46.790]  They said, how do you want to be listed? I gave them f*** face as a thing, and they didn't list it.
[14:47.210 --> 14:52.510]  It sounds like AAPW are a bunch of pussies, and AAPLE are fucking awesome.
[14:55.490 --> 14:56.050]  AAPW.
[15:01.410 --> 15:05.650]  Anyway, that's the mystery solved. It was Eric Allalong.
[15:05.790 --> 15:07.230]  I learned something.
[15:07.410 --> 15:15.090]  Hang on, shut up. Hang on. How is that on me? How is the variety thing on me at all?
[15:15.510 --> 15:17.510]  Well, I assume that you said the same thing to variety.
[15:20.450 --> 15:22.950]  You assume that I talk to variety?
[15:23.450 --> 15:24.170]  You talk to wrestling?
[15:24.630 --> 15:26.730]  Do you think those are the same thing?
[15:27.170 --> 15:30.510]  Uh, I mean, are you not allowed to talk to both?
[15:30.870 --> 15:34.870]  You can. I don't think if I emailed variety, they would email me back.
[15:35.470 --> 15:36.670]  You'd be surprised.
[15:37.790 --> 15:40.990]  Okay, now it's sounding like this was Andrew's doing.
[15:40.990 --> 15:48.890]  No, I just, I've emailed a lot of people, and I often don't expect replies when the fucking Jane Goodall Society replied to me.
[15:48.970 --> 15:51.210]  I'm just saying, you'll be surprised what happens.
[15:51.530 --> 15:54.630]  Either way, the variety thing was not me. I just want that to be known.
[15:56.110 --> 15:59.890]  Okay. Well, I'll put a pin in it on the whiteboard, and we'll keep looking.
[16:00.410 --> 16:02.410]  How many pins does the whiteboard currently have?
[16:02.590 --> 16:05.930]  I have to invent it, and then build it, and then take a picture of it.
[16:06.190 --> 16:08.310]  I don't have time to do that in the next 30 seconds.
[16:08.750 --> 16:09.810]  It's gotta be in that order.
[16:09.810 --> 16:15.390]  This is another little tidying up thing. I learned something that I thought was more recent than it was.
[16:15.590 --> 16:22.150]  But I was talking the other day about the rats, the rat meat that plays Doom and all that, and how it's called wetware.
[16:22.550 --> 16:26.690]  I bought a movie that I'd never seen, because I was interested in seeing it.
[16:27.870 --> 16:29.410]  Johnny Mnemonic, right?
[16:29.910 --> 16:31.110]  Oh, yeah!
[16:31.390 --> 16:37.850]  His job, courier, his package, 320 gigabytes of stolen data, wet-wired directly into his brain.
[16:37.850 --> 16:39.650]  His name, Johnny.
[16:39.810 --> 16:42.690]  And then I was looking up wetware, been around for decades.
[16:44.150 --> 16:45.930]  Like the 60s or something, right?
[16:46.310 --> 16:46.750]  Crazy.
[16:47.330 --> 16:54.070]  Dude, I love how you chose to describe, I bought a movie because I'd never seen it, and I wanted to see it.
[16:54.690 --> 16:58.350]  I was feeling, because the thing wouldn't paste into Discord, I was adding fluff.
[17:02.590 --> 17:06.210]  It was like a real progress bar sentence there, I'm sorry about that.
[17:06.730 --> 17:10.470]  Have you ever bought a movie because you didn't want to see it?
[17:11.130 --> 17:13.290]  So, what the fuck is this?
[17:13.430 --> 17:20.230]  Yes, actually, I bought Citizen Kane. I did not enjoy, well, I had no intention of actually watching it.
[17:20.290 --> 17:24.070]  I thought I should have it, because one day I might want to watch it. Didn't actually want to watch it.
[17:24.770 --> 17:25.090]  Did you?
[17:25.250 --> 17:25.510]  I did watch it.
[17:26.370 --> 17:27.010]  Phenomenal film.
[17:28.230 --> 17:28.830]  Is it?
[17:29.490 --> 17:32.930]  Have you seen the movie about the making of Citizen Kane?
[17:33.190 --> 17:33.370]  No.
[17:33.390 --> 17:33.910]  Gary Oldman?
[17:33.910 --> 17:34.410]  No.
[17:34.590 --> 17:36.890]  Have you seen that one? Maybe you should start there.
[17:37.810 --> 17:39.070]  Well, I started with the movie.
[17:39.570 --> 17:42.190]  Oh, you saw it? I missed that part. I thought you weren't going to see it.
[17:42.330 --> 17:51.590]  I can see why it was ahead of its time and why it pioneered so much, but I think as a movie, in today's world, it's a bit of a snoozer.
[17:52.010 --> 17:53.510]  Wouldn't be in your top ten for that year?
[17:54.010 --> 17:54.230]  No.
[17:54.530 --> 17:56.910]  For that year? Yeah, for sure.
[17:57.150 --> 17:57.910]  For this year? No.
[17:58.050 --> 17:59.150]  For the summer of 98? No.
[17:59.150 --> 18:04.510]  So what you're saying is a movie that was made almost 100 years ago can't hold up to Johnny Mnemonic now?
[18:06.290 --> 18:07.010]  I mean...
[18:07.010 --> 18:08.950]  There was no wetware in it, so...
[18:08.950 --> 18:09.210]  No.
[18:09.350 --> 18:10.910]  Fair enough. It hadn't been invented yet.
[18:11.670 --> 18:16.010]  It isn't like the... I haven't seen Johnny Mnemonic in a long time. These are the things I remember about it.
[18:16.170 --> 18:20.290]  The best representation of how to use the internet I've ever seen in any movie.
[18:20.870 --> 18:22.490]  Did you watch this, Gavin? Have you seen it yet?
[18:22.610 --> 18:23.010]  No, I haven't seen it yet.
[18:23.010 --> 18:34.230]  Okay, great internet usage, and I think there's a dolphin that can browse the web. Or is like the intelligence agency, essentially.
[18:34.590 --> 18:36.290]  That's taking wetware to the next level.
[18:36.630 --> 18:42.970]  Well, dude, there was that George C. Scott movie we talked about watching, Day of the Dolphin, where they were training dolphins to kill people.
[18:43.450 --> 18:43.730]  Oh, yeah.
[18:43.770 --> 18:44.150]  That's true.
[18:44.330 --> 18:45.350]  So there's precedent there.
[18:45.750 --> 18:46.430]  There is, yeah.
[18:46.430 --> 18:50.890]  There it is! Look at that tech dolphin on the internet.
[18:54.030 --> 18:55.510]  You gotta watch out for those dolphins.
[18:57.350 --> 18:58.150]  Oh, Jesus.
[18:59.250 --> 19:05.110]  So I have a thing I can share at the end of the story. A saga. At least I believe it's over. It might not be over.
[19:06.570 --> 19:13.090]  Around seven or eight months ago, and I feel comfortable. I haven't been told I can't talk about this, so I'm assuming I can talk about it.
[19:13.510 --> 19:14.090]  That's how it works.
[19:14.090 --> 19:25.290]  Seven or eight months ago, I got reached out to by someone at the company saying that they were filming a podcast commercial and they wanted me to be in it.
[19:25.790 --> 19:28.110]  And Geoff and Eric, you guys are part of this as well.
[19:28.950 --> 19:32.770]  They asked, they reached out, they said, hey, we want you to be in this commercial. What would your rate be?
[19:32.830 --> 19:35.670]  Like, what would you want to be in this commercial?
[19:35.670 --> 19:44.550]  Which is something that I've never been asked before. I didn't know how to approach it. I've never done anything like that in any context.
[19:44.670 --> 19:54.230]  I was like, well, what should I ask for? And then it becomes a question of, well, if I don't know anything, why don't I just ask for, like, the silliest thing I could ask for and just see what happens?
[19:54.230 --> 19:59.110]  So my response to them saying, like, what would you want in exchange for being in this commercial?
[19:59.290 --> 20:11.610]  Was I said that I would gladly do it free of charge, but I would want 1% of all profits from any anal merchandise sales in the year 2023.
[20:12.530 --> 20:19.470]  That was my one demand. I want a 1%. And I didn't think I'd get it, but I thought I might as well ask and just see what happens.
[20:19.470 --> 20:28.330]  And so I asked, and I waited patiently, and they replied, I would need to talk to somebody else about this. Is that what you really want?
[20:28.730 --> 20:39.110]  And the answer to that was absolutely, because now we can get multiple departments involved in this, trying to figure out if I can earn 1% of anal profit.
[20:39.970 --> 20:41.510]  I'm all about it. That's great.
[20:41.650 --> 20:44.150]  Actually, these are real people doing real people jobs.
[20:44.150 --> 20:48.390]  I know, that's what makes it so funny. There's a real person meeting with real people.
[20:48.790 --> 20:50.790]  No, but that's what makes it really funny.
[20:50.930 --> 20:53.490]  You have fun, buddy.
[20:53.890 --> 20:55.950]  I'm having fun. I'm having a great time.
[20:56.490 --> 21:01.170]  So then, and I'm not going to push for it. I'm not going to be difficult. I just figured I'd ask and see what happens.
[21:01.210 --> 21:04.030]  If I could get it, I would love to have that. That'd be a great thing to have.
[21:04.890 --> 21:07.710]  And so it was our number one selling shirt the year it came out.
[21:08.230 --> 21:10.330]  A lot of profit, potentially, 1%.
[21:10.330 --> 21:11.070]  The old anal passage?
[21:11.070 --> 21:12.430]  Yeah, the old anal passage.
[21:12.630 --> 21:15.210]  So they said, we need to talk to someone.
[21:15.350 --> 21:16.950]  I replied, yeah, that sounds great. Let me know.
[21:17.330 --> 21:21.410]  Then they replied, we would rather not do that.
[21:21.810 --> 21:24.770]  How does X amount of dollars sound for doing this?
[21:25.150 --> 21:27.630]  And I said, fantastic. That sounds great. Thank you.
[21:27.930 --> 21:30.250]  I'm in. Whatever you need, let me know.
[21:30.650 --> 21:33.170]  Then this went dark for quite a few months.
[21:33.350 --> 21:34.450]  For a long time.
[21:34.630 --> 21:37.010]  And I just assumed that either it was dropped,
[21:37.010 --> 21:41.930]  or maybe after my anal shenanigans, they had decided to move on without me.
[21:42.250 --> 21:48.050]  However, during that time, I know Geoff and Eric filmed part of the commercial,
[21:48.190 --> 21:51.790]  and they mentioned that they left a section for me in it,
[21:51.930 --> 21:54.990]  and I could just kind of improvise whatever I wanted to in the thing.
[21:55.070 --> 21:56.670]  So that was the last I heard for it for quite a while.
[21:57.090 --> 22:01.630]  Then, at the start of this week, it finally came back up again.
[22:01.650 --> 22:02.710]  I got reached out to again.
[22:03.090 --> 22:06.830]  They said, hey, did we ever send you the paperwork for getting paid for this?
[22:07.270 --> 22:09.950]  Which they hadn't. We figured all that out.
[22:10.050 --> 22:13.270]  They're like, we'll send you a link of the commercial,
[22:13.570 --> 22:15.830]  and you can see where your part is, and you just improvise.
[22:17.010 --> 22:18.630]  Send us some lines.
[22:18.910 --> 22:20.350]  Wait, so this hasn't come out yet?
[22:20.830 --> 22:22.290]  It hasn't come out yet, no.
[22:22.450 --> 22:24.910]  I just recorded lines for it this week.
[22:24.990 --> 22:27.030]  Dude, I'm so excited to hear where this is going,
[22:27.130 --> 22:30.730]  because I have no fucking clue what this commercial is, or what I participated in.
[22:30.810 --> 22:32.130]  What are you talking about? We shot it.
[22:32.510 --> 22:33.130]  I don't remember.
[22:33.550 --> 22:34.030]  You and Eric shot it.
[22:34.030 --> 22:36.670]  We shoot lots of stuff. I just don't remember what this is.
[22:36.810 --> 22:39.230]  Right, but it was a specific thing for a podcast commercial.
[22:39.550 --> 22:40.850]  So, I'll describe it.
[22:41.470 --> 22:43.050]  Let's see if you remember the commercial.
[22:43.130 --> 22:44.310]  So, I get sent the commercial,
[22:45.010 --> 22:51.030]  and it's you and Eric sitting in a dugout with BK between the two of you.
[22:51.050 --> 22:51.890]  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.
[22:52.150 --> 22:53.750]  That was in March.
[22:54.410 --> 22:55.590]  Yeah, it was a long time ago.
[22:56.370 --> 22:57.310]  Yep, it was quite a bit.
[22:58.550 --> 23:00.050]  So, they send it to me, and they say,
[23:00.050 --> 23:04.330]  The 22 seconds is when you need to do your thing.
[23:04.630 --> 23:06.190]  So, you guys are going back and forth.
[23:07.290 --> 23:12.290]  You guys are saying that Geoff could get concussed by a peeled orange thrown by Eric.
[23:12.610 --> 23:13.330]  And then Eric says,
[23:13.390 --> 23:15.030]  You know, Andrew, you could do this, right?
[23:15.350 --> 23:17.990]  And I have one second to fill, essentially.
[23:18.150 --> 23:18.930]  It's my contribution.
[23:19.350 --> 23:21.310]  There's a one second pause, and then it just moves on.
[23:21.930 --> 23:24.130]  So, I was instructed.
[23:24.210 --> 23:25.630]  They wanted a variety of takes.
[23:25.630 --> 23:30.550]  So, I wrote out as many takes as I could think of.
[23:30.570 --> 23:34.350]  Of things that I thought could be funny for my one second.
[23:34.690 --> 23:37.370]  And I may have went slightly overboard.
[23:37.790 --> 23:41.550]  But they said that I would only get paid if I accommodated a variety of takes.
[23:41.810 --> 23:44.350]  So, I'm going to paste into our chat.
[23:44.570 --> 23:48.450]  I wrote 75 different versions of what could be said.
[23:48.910 --> 23:51.530]  And then I added some additional ones.
[23:52.690 --> 23:54.570]  They're never going to work with you again.
[23:54.570 --> 23:55.730]  This is insane.
[23:55.890 --> 23:58.970]  There's no way they said you wouldn't get paid if you didn't give them a variety of takes.
[23:58.970 --> 23:59.590]  Yeah, no shit.
[23:59.590 --> 24:00.030]  They did.
[24:00.130 --> 24:02.410]  Like Wes is going,
[24:02.590 --> 24:05.110]  You better give me 60 plus takes.
[24:05.290 --> 24:05.830]  Give me the takes.
[24:06.370 --> 24:06.910]  They didn't.
[24:08.030 --> 24:08.750]  I'll fucking.
[24:09.170 --> 24:09.710]  Give me a second.
[24:09.830 --> 24:10.710]  He's got receipts.
[24:11.290 --> 24:12.030]  He always has his receipts.
[24:12.030 --> 24:13.010]  I didn't expect to get called out for this.
[24:13.110 --> 24:13.610]  Give me a second.
[24:13.690 --> 24:14.670]  Let me get my receipts out.
[24:15.070 --> 24:19.650]  I was told that unless I met the variety of takes,
[24:21.250 --> 24:21.650]  That...
[24:23.170 --> 24:23.850]  Give me a second.
[24:23.850 --> 24:25.750]  This is a very variety-heavy episode, by the way.
[24:25.890 --> 24:27.810]  We're talking about variety segment to segment.
[24:27.970 --> 24:28.750]  This is really a lot.
[24:28.830 --> 24:31.690]  So, is Stanley Kubrick directing this trailer?
[24:31.810 --> 24:32.590]  And I just wasn't aware of it.
[24:33.010 --> 24:34.090]  I wasn't aware of it.
[24:34.090 --> 24:34.710]  I don't know who directed it.
[24:34.710 --> 24:35.530]  It's Wes. It's pretty close, right?
[24:35.850 --> 24:36.130]  Yeah.
[24:37.050 --> 24:39.150]  Okay, I'm going to send you...
[24:39.150 --> 24:40.370]  I'm saving this.
[24:40.430 --> 24:41.370]  I'm screenshotting it.
[24:41.710 --> 24:42.770]  Sorry for having to fill.
[24:42.870 --> 24:46.690]  I didn't expect, as an honorable man, to have my integrity questioned.
[24:47.330 --> 24:49.250]  And who are you interacting with directly here?
[24:49.250 --> 24:50.570]  It's questioning your integrity.
[24:50.730 --> 24:52.570]  It just seems like a harsh thing to say.
[24:53.210 --> 24:57.750]  Second, make sure the paperwork comes through this week and is signed on your end.
[24:57.810 --> 25:02.830]  Your payment will get processed on or end after Monday, assuming we receive the take variations needed.
[25:03.070 --> 25:04.390]  Hope that works for you.
[25:04.850 --> 25:07.190]  That's a really different phrasing from what you just said.
[25:07.190 --> 25:07.950]  Very different.
[25:08.430 --> 25:13.230]  Yeah, it sounds like they've given you, like, we want these variants and been specific about those variants.
[25:13.390 --> 25:16.910]  No, they said I could just add whatever I wanted, and they wanted a variety of takes.
[25:17.030 --> 25:17.930]  So, you did 75.
[25:17.990 --> 25:18.810]  What are the 75?
[25:19.270 --> 25:22.310]  So, I'm going to post them in our chat right now.
[25:22.330 --> 25:24.790]  I mean, why even post them? Can't you just do it and take up 75 seconds?
[25:25.130 --> 25:26.910]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[25:27.230 --> 25:27.490]  What was the leading sentence again?
[25:27.830 --> 25:30.210]  We need you to do all 75 real fast.
[25:30.530 --> 25:34.010]  Listen, I've recorded this already and submitted it.
[25:34.190 --> 25:39.250]  If you can't accommodate the need for us to hear all 75 takes, then I don't know if your payment will be coming this week.
[25:39.250 --> 25:42.990]  Well, maybe we can throw it into the end of this episode or as a supplemental in itself.
[25:43.130 --> 25:45.050]  It's 19 and a half minutes long.
[25:45.070 --> 25:45.770]  Oh, God.
[25:45.870 --> 25:47.350]  We just need you to do one second.
[25:47.770 --> 25:49.370]  Your 75 one second takes?
[25:49.450 --> 25:51.170]  That should take like 88 seconds.
[25:51.290 --> 25:54.410]  Well, no, because I did variations of each take.
[25:54.430 --> 25:55.770]  But we don't need you to do that here.
[25:55.970 --> 25:56.250]  I did different stylings.
[25:56.370 --> 25:57.710]  We just need you to do one of each.
[25:57.850 --> 26:01.330]  You want us to put 19 minutes of takes at the end of this episode?
[26:01.490 --> 26:01.690]  No.
[26:02.230 --> 26:03.070]  I'm just saying.
[26:03.850 --> 26:06.490]  Dude, do the list and I'll do the fucking takes.
[26:06.930 --> 26:11.790]  It's too... I tried to paste it and it said the character limit is too long.
[26:12.410 --> 26:13.290]  It's too powerful.
[26:13.450 --> 26:15.850]  Your 75 lines are too powerful.
[26:15.870 --> 26:16.830]  Let's delete this.
[26:16.830 --> 26:19.930]  Okay, so I'm going to send the first half and then I'll send the back half.
[26:19.930 --> 26:20.970]  Oh my God.
[26:21.550 --> 26:22.090]  There you go.
[26:22.350 --> 26:22.950]  Oh my God.
[26:22.970 --> 26:24.030]  Each one is a different line.
[26:24.270 --> 26:26.070]  So what was the lead in line for you?
[26:26.130 --> 26:26.830]  What are you responding to?
[26:26.990 --> 26:29.150]  It was something like, you could do this right?
[26:29.290 --> 26:30.230]  Or something like that.
[26:30.710 --> 26:32.570]  Oh, so the first line is, of course I could.
[26:32.990 --> 26:33.870]  Yeah, and then...
[26:33.870 --> 26:35.750]  One of the lines is, let's play.
[26:36.210 --> 26:38.170]  Let's go round Robin.
[26:38.270 --> 26:41.470]  Let's go Gavin, Geoff, Andrew, Eric.
[26:41.910 --> 26:42.730]  And of course I could.
[26:43.230 --> 26:43.630]  Ah.
[26:44.810 --> 26:45.190]  Then Eric.
[26:45.190 --> 26:47.030]  Oh, I thought it was Andrew, I'm sorry.
[26:47.590 --> 26:49.070]  Oranges taste good.
[26:49.910 --> 26:52.090]  One sec, I'll have a side of pencils.
[26:52.410 --> 26:53.110]  Well, this must be Andrew.
[26:53.630 --> 26:55.550]  Y'all ever think about chili dogs?
[26:55.990 --> 26:57.430]  Grown tube noises.
[26:57.910 --> 27:00.030]  With burger confidence, anything's possible.
[27:00.270 --> 27:01.470]  You're both idiots.
[27:01.790 --> 27:03.370]  The kickings were a legend.
[27:03.950 --> 27:05.590]  There's a snake in my boot.
[27:05.750 --> 27:06.390]  That's for a movie.
[27:06.410 --> 27:08.210]  You could kill someone with a Mandarin.
[27:09.790 --> 27:10.830]  Let's play!
[27:11.870 --> 27:13.330]  You're wasting my bits.
[27:13.330 --> 27:17.210]  When are y'all picking me up from the survived Black Island?
[27:18.050 --> 27:19.510]  Don't drink the Bovril.
[27:19.710 --> 27:21.190]  The tiger's out of the bowl.
[27:21.990 --> 27:23.610]  With iced up ears, you're done.
[27:24.070 --> 27:26.450]  How is it not a finite pool?
[27:26.890 --> 27:28.130]  Oh, I don't... fuck, sorry.
[27:29.470 --> 27:31.990]  Anyway, it goes on. It's ridiculous. Forever.
[27:32.810 --> 27:33.250]  Oh.
[27:33.670 --> 27:35.870]  How are you gonna fit some of these into one second?
[27:36.130 --> 27:38.450]  There's one that says, is this Anba?
[27:39.410 --> 27:45.430]  There's one that says, you know this reminds me of the time my great uncle Sebastian went fishing down at Oak Bay.
[27:45.590 --> 27:48.230]  It was a hot day, not in temperature, but feel.
[27:48.430 --> 27:50.190]  How are you gonna say that in one second?
[27:52.470 --> 27:53.830]  Epstein was killed?
[27:57.330 --> 28:00.090]  I can take you out with a grape.
[28:03.070 --> 28:05.390]  Who lets the dogs out?
[28:05.890 --> 28:10.570]  The ones that are not creative are so fucking funny to me.
[28:10.590 --> 28:12.910]  It's just, you wrote down a thing you know.
[28:13.730 --> 28:18.370]  No, it was... these are all things that played out in my head that would make me laugh if that was what they went with.
[28:18.510 --> 28:21.190]  They're so funny, man. These are so funny.
[28:21.690 --> 28:24.210]  I'm just here so I don't get fined!
[28:24.610 --> 28:26.910]  It's my first pick in the concussion draft.
[28:30.230 --> 28:35.170]  I hope that you hit the ones that they wanted right in the middle of all this.
[28:37.230 --> 28:38.110]  Holy shit.
[28:38.770 --> 28:45.510]  I submitted my 19 and a half minute recording of doing all these different takes and sent it off.
[28:45.730 --> 28:50.250]  And they said, great, thank you. We'll forward it to the editor. Let me know if there's any issues or anything.
[28:50.850 --> 28:51.990]  And that's where we left off.
[28:52.090 --> 28:55.750]  Immediately they're thinking, why wasn't this attached to an email? Wait, how big is this file?
[28:56.710 --> 28:59.550]  I think I fulfilled my obligation to the commercial.
[28:59.730 --> 29:01.770]  I'm excited to see what they go with.
[29:02.290 --> 29:06.910]  Andrew, you are the funniest person, man.
[29:08.110 --> 29:09.070]  You're a psychopath.
[29:09.250 --> 29:10.830]  There is nobody like you.
[29:12.430 --> 29:16.310]  God damn, man. You are some kind of brilliant genius.
[29:17.810 --> 29:19.030]  In some ways.
[29:19.570 --> 29:22.390]  Only if it's thrown through an anal passage first.
[29:22.390 --> 29:25.450]  Me? No. But Johnny Caviar? Without a doubt.
[29:25.830 --> 29:28.930]  I would never do this to another person.
[29:31.030 --> 29:34.810]  The editor is going to be scrolling through, does rice pudding have rice in it?
[29:35.370 --> 29:35.970]  What on earth?
[29:36.470 --> 29:37.670]  I'm with you, gooch pooch.
[29:38.770 --> 29:42.210]  Well, that's because Eric says, see, he knows. And I thought that'd be funny because he hates gooch pooch.
[29:42.210 --> 29:44.510]  I'd knock him back to 98. That's a good one.
[29:45.270 --> 29:46.010]  Oh, man.
[29:46.350 --> 29:49.950]  It's starting to get tough near the end, trying to come up with things. I'm struggling.
[29:49.950 --> 29:52.090]  I want to get 75, though.
[29:52.290 --> 29:53.830]  Those go towards your 20,000 things.
[29:54.690 --> 29:55.770]  Oh, it does. Yeah.
[29:56.010 --> 29:57.950]  That's also incredibly difficult to write.
[29:58.150 --> 30:04.390]  What you've given them there, it's like a starter pack of being able to insert you into every production for the next five years.
[30:04.570 --> 30:07.470]  Every single possible thing that they might want you to say.
[30:07.710 --> 30:11.150]  They need to hire you for four more commercials and then they have, then they're you.
[30:11.410 --> 30:12.610]  They can make you say anything.
[30:13.270 --> 30:14.830]  Yeah, that's fine.
[30:15.470 --> 30:18.070]  I had fun anyway. I hope they enjoyed it.
[30:18.070 --> 30:19.390]  We'll find out about that.
[30:19.530 --> 30:25.970]  I messaged Eric about this saying, I have a thing, it could be like supplemental or in some way, but I think a department might hate me.
[30:26.330 --> 30:27.510]  And then I just did it.
[30:29.690 --> 30:31.570]  Really, I'm just impressed.
[30:32.130 --> 30:33.910]  I'm really impressed. 19 minutes.
[30:34.270 --> 30:38.530]  The most dangerous thing we could give Andrew isn't weaponry or anything, it's just time.
[30:38.930 --> 30:39.930]  It's time and freedom.
[30:41.790 --> 30:42.790]  Time and ambiguity.
[30:42.790 --> 30:52.330]  What do you think the odds are that whoever's editing it, Dan or whoever, picks the first line, of course I could, plugs it in and never listens to the other.
[30:53.070 --> 30:53.470]  100%.
[30:53.470 --> 30:58.090]  It's going to be Jake and he's going to go, I mean, that's fine.
[30:58.290 --> 31:00.330]  What am I going to use?
[31:00.630 --> 31:02.050]  The desk dogs are burning.
[31:02.210 --> 31:03.470]  The fire is everywhere.
[31:03.650 --> 31:05.030]  For the love of God, help me.
[31:06.610 --> 31:11.210]  What was fun about that is they were testing the fire alarms in our building on that day.
[31:11.210 --> 31:14.130]  So I was able to utilize the fire alarms going on.
[31:14.850 --> 31:15.650]  That's awesome.
[31:15.890 --> 31:16.950]  So you brought sound effects.
[31:17.030 --> 31:19.950]  I wanted to. It didn't end up working out.
[31:20.130 --> 31:21.190]  That was my hope.
[31:21.590 --> 31:23.390]  It wasn't as constant as I thought it would be.
[31:24.230 --> 31:25.190]  That's fucking brilliant.
[31:25.630 --> 31:28.330]  Yeah, so that was my week, or part of my week.
[31:29.110 --> 31:29.510]  It was a lot of fun.
[31:29.910 --> 31:30.430]  Good work.
[31:32.190 --> 31:34.450]  I'll send it to you guys, I guess, if you want to hear the audio.
[31:34.790 --> 31:35.250]  Yeah, please.
[31:36.090 --> 31:36.490]  Absolutely.
[31:37.550 --> 31:39.270]  I'll post all those on Instagram or something.
[31:44.380 --> 31:48.260]  Cold turkey may be great on sandwiches, but there's a better way to break your bad habits.
[31:48.740 --> 31:52.440]  And before we expand on breaking bad habits, I just want to say cold turkey is so good.
[31:52.900 --> 31:55.040]  Like, post Thanksgiving leftovers.
[31:55.620 --> 32:00.000]  It's one of the versatile meats that I think is almost as good warm as it is cold.
[32:00.400 --> 32:01.100]  It's fantastic.
[32:01.560 --> 32:06.580]  And I don't know if this is controversial or not, but if we're doing a Thanksgiving draft, I think I'd take cranberry sauce first round.
[32:06.820 --> 32:07.700]  It's a great thing.
[32:08.040 --> 32:11.280]  It's so delicious, but I'm going way too deep on turkey.
[32:11.280 --> 32:15.860]  We're here to talk about our sponsor, Fume, and how they look at the problem in a different way.
[32:16.520 --> 32:22.220]  Not everything in a bad habit is wrong, so instead of drastic and comfortable change, why not just remove the bad from your habit?
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.460]  Fume is an innovative, award-nominated device that does just that.
[32:26.960 --> 32:29.500]  Instead of electronics, Fume is completely natural.
[32:29.860 --> 32:32.320]  Instead of vapor, Fume uses flavored air.
[32:32.800 --> 32:37.000]  And instead of harmful chemicals, Fume uses all natural, delicious flavors.
[32:37.500 --> 32:38.080]  You get it.
[32:38.420 --> 32:40.180]  Instead of bad, Fume is good.
[32:40.180 --> 32:44.140]  It's a habit you're free to enjoy, and makes replacing your bad habit easy.
[32:44.840 --> 32:49.940]  Your Fume comes with an adjustable airflow dial, and is designed with movable parts and magnets for fidgeting,
[32:50.280 --> 32:55.860]  giving your fingers a lot to do, which is helpful for de-stressing and anxiety while breaking your habit.
[32:56.320 --> 32:59.160]  And some of the things I love about Fume is just the feel of it.
[32:59.220 --> 33:02.940]  It's so well-weighted, it's perfectly balanced, and just fun to fidget with.
[33:03.320 --> 33:06.460]  Also, I was struck by how beautiful it is, the real wood and the shape.
[33:06.800 --> 33:08.580]  It's something you will feel cool using.
[33:09.400 --> 33:11.740]  Stopping is something we all put off because it's hard.
[33:12.100 --> 33:15.580]  But switching to Fume is easy, enjoyable, and even fun.
[33:16.220 --> 33:22.260]  Fume has served over 100,000 customers and has thousands of success stories, and there's no reason that can't be you.

[34:04.020 --> 34:06.940]  This is kind of not a monumental thought or anything.
[34:07.140 --> 34:12.720]  I was looking at my arms, and I'm like 5'9.5-ish in height.
[34:13.080 --> 34:14.660]  I'm pretty close to 5'10, not quite 5'10.
[34:15.100 --> 34:20.840]  And I was thinking, if my arms were shorter but I was taller, I would absolutely make that trade.
[34:21.460 --> 34:24.140]  So I was going to measure my arms and decide how...
[34:24.540 --> 34:29.280]  I was curious how much of your arms you guys would give up for additional leg height.
[34:29.980 --> 34:32.360]  Because I feel like I could have half the length of my arms.
[34:32.900 --> 34:34.600]  And still be pretty okay.
[34:34.900 --> 34:37.220]  I'm around 26-27 inch.
[34:38.460 --> 34:39.620]  Andrew, what are you?
[34:40.420 --> 34:42.240]  I have no idea. I forgot to do this homework.
[34:42.460 --> 34:43.880]  That's what I'm saying. I feel so bad.
[34:44.800 --> 34:47.920]  I completely forgot. Listen, I've had a busy week writing 75 takes.
[34:48.240 --> 34:49.220]  It slipped my mind.
[34:49.480 --> 34:53.380]  Absolutely. That's why I just asked. We can table it and come back next week with it.
[34:53.440 --> 34:55.060]  Sure. Why don't we come back next week.
[34:55.360 --> 35:00.160]  I have one main other thing I'd like to add, and then Geoff, it could be all yours.
[35:00.160 --> 35:02.080]  It was my birthday last week.
[35:03.720 --> 35:09.600]  And first of all, I just want to say that the community and some of my friends put together a video wishing me a happy birthday.
[35:09.780 --> 35:13.080]  That was incredibly sweet. I appreciate it so much. It was really kind.
[35:13.880 --> 35:18.680]  Some of our wonderful members of the community made a little video. My friends edited it together and organized it.
[35:18.840 --> 35:20.400]  So that was awesome.
[35:20.680 --> 35:24.260]  It's weird that it wasn't at the same time as it was in Survive Block Island.
[35:27.300 --> 35:30.240]  Yeah. I like to celebrate multiple days.
[35:32.800 --> 35:33.740]  That was awesome.
[35:33.820 --> 35:35.260]  Time moves differently on Block Island, Gavin.
[35:35.560 --> 35:41.840]  And then Gavin and I were playing games a few weeks ago, and we were talking about...
[35:41.840 --> 35:45.720]  I had just seen Dirty Work for the first time, which, as we've talked about before,
[35:45.800 --> 35:49.460]  Norm Macdonald, a huge comedic influence for both Geoff and I. Love him.
[35:49.940 --> 35:55.080]  And Dirty Work was sort of one of those things we've talked about where I figured it would always be pretty accessible,
[35:55.320 --> 35:58.260]  so I kind of avoided watching it because I've seen so much Norm content.
[35:58.760 --> 36:05.940]  It makes me happy to know that I have something out there to enjoy whenever I want to or feel like I need to.
[36:06.480 --> 36:09.900]  And I was talking to Gavin about... we were playing a game...
[36:09.900 --> 36:13.160]  that one of my great regrets in terms of buying things...
[36:13.160 --> 36:16.320]  like, not a real regret, but just like, oh, I should have done that...
[36:17.220 --> 36:22.300]  I was on Staples' website for some reason, looking for something, and I searched it,
[36:22.460 --> 36:26.900]  and what I wanted didn't come up, but the Norm Show DVD did, and it was $19.99.
[36:27.620 --> 36:32.020]  And I was like, holy shit, that's... I didn't even... okay, I didn't know that was a thing I could buy.
[36:32.380 --> 36:36.980]  That's awesome. But it was at a time where it's like, oh, I really can't... I need that $19.99 right now.
[36:37.020 --> 36:40.140]  I can't buy this, but maybe I'll go down the road, I'll pick it up.
[36:40.880 --> 36:43.960]  And then I didn't, and then when I went to, it was gone.
[36:43.960 --> 36:48.120]  To which I then learned that the Norm Show DVD is like, super rare.
[36:48.240 --> 36:57.260]  It is a very collectible thing. You can find them online for anywhere between like, $200 to like, $500 for this box set.
[36:57.580 --> 36:59.020]  And there's not many available to buy online.
[36:59.640 --> 37:07.220]  So I was talking to Gavin about that, we're playing games, and then I got a birthday gift arrived yesterday from Gavin
[37:07.220 --> 37:15.900]  that was incredibly sweet. I was mentioning when we were playing how much of a regret that was that I didn't buy it,
[37:16.400 --> 37:20.600]  and just how much I wish I did, and just how, you know, Gavin knows so much like Norm.
[37:20.780 --> 37:26.220]  That was my gift from Gavin, which was super kind. He got me the Norm Show on DVD.
[37:26.740 --> 37:30.600]  Yeah, that's so sweet. I was so happy. Thank you, Gavin, it was such a wonderful gift.
[37:30.860 --> 37:32.900]  Oh, I'm glad you like it. That's for your next 10 birthdays.
[37:33.660 --> 37:36.440]  Yeah, no, it was very kind. It was just a wonderful thing.
[37:38.820 --> 37:46.580]  However, that evening, after talking to Gavin about it, and, you know, just being really passionate, sharing like,
[37:46.640 --> 37:49.680]  oh, how much I regret it, and how much I wish I had it.
[37:50.060 --> 37:57.760]  I thought, my birthday is coming up, and you know what? It's a lot of money.
[37:58.000 --> 37:59.500]  I had a feeling this would be happening.
[37:59.500 --> 38:08.600]  I'm gonna treat myself in a way I typically don't, so my gift for myself was a copy of the Norm Show.
[38:09.020 --> 38:11.120]  We've got, we've incited it again.
[38:14.060 --> 38:19.980]  I didn't want to share this, because it is such a thoughtful gift, and I didn't want you to feel it was diminished in any way,
[38:20.300 --> 38:23.240]  but after the Bo Burnham final, we Bo Burnham-ed it.
[38:23.720 --> 38:24.200]  Wow.
[38:24.240 --> 38:25.660]  You Bo Burnham-ed it again.
[38:27.440 --> 38:36.680]  So now, and this is not a complaint, I love the fact that I have two of these, but in the matter of several days,
[38:36.820 --> 38:44.440]  I went from wanting this thing for years, to within a four-day window, owning two copies of it.
[38:44.660 --> 38:45.340]  Oh, God.
[38:49.340 --> 38:50.140]  It was...
[38:50.140 --> 38:57.080]  I wonder how many of those DVDs are left on this earth, and what percentage that makes up.
[38:58.700 --> 39:00.340]  It, when I...
[39:00.340 --> 39:04.400]  I knew something was coming, because you were like, I can't wait to talk about it on the episode,
[39:04.520 --> 39:08.360]  and I was just thinking, I don't really think like, that's not like funny content or anything,
[39:08.420 --> 39:10.080]  and then I was like, oh, okay, there's something coming.
[39:11.040 --> 39:18.860]  Yeah, well, I did, I want, it was, I felt conflicted, because I wanted, like I didn't, I wanted your reaction in the episode,
[39:18.860 --> 39:27.100]  but I also like, I don't know, I felt weird to withhold, but I had a good laugh looking at that, being like, of course.
[39:27.400 --> 39:30.080]  So you, did you already have yours when you opened mine?
[39:30.480 --> 39:36.800]  Yes, yes, I did, I got it like four days prior, maybe even less, maybe like three days ago, I opened mine,
[39:36.800 --> 39:43.160]  it was like, oh, it arrived, and then I got yours. I immediately went to eBay, and was like, what?
[39:43.400 --> 39:46.380]  I think I figured out which one you got, and I know which one I got.
[39:46.540 --> 39:52.460]  There were like five or six bought, I'm assuming you got on eBay, within a time period, and I was like, oh.
[39:53.600 --> 39:58.140]  I didn't, there were certain things where I could differentiate, I was like, I really hope you didn't get this one,
[39:58.180 --> 40:01.240]  because it, the prices range quite a bit on it, so.
[40:02.120 --> 40:08.520]  That's, that's so funny, because you told me after you bought yourself the DVD, you were like, I bought myself a birthday present,
[40:08.940 --> 40:12.640]  and I was like, that's fucking brilliant, and we talked about like, I want to know how the show is,
[40:12.680 --> 40:17.500]  because I have, I've only, I only caught like two episodes live, when it was on TV, so I don't really know much about it.
[40:18.180 --> 40:22.520]  And when you're retelling the story, I'm like, I don't remember him, I'm pretty sure he said he bought it, not Gavin, what the fuck?
[40:24.160 --> 40:29.080]  That was another factor in my head, I wanted your reaction as well, but I was like, oh, I already talked to him about this,
[40:29.080 --> 40:34.500]  maybe I just like, I thought about texting you ahead of time, of like, don't reveal it, if I'm saying it, or like, make a correction,
[40:34.880 --> 40:40.060]  because I want Gavin to be like, I want that moment, but I just assumed you would have the reaction you did of like,
[40:40.100 --> 40:42.880]  I don't, I don't remember it going this way, when we talked about it.
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.700]  Yeah, I just figured you'd be explaining, yeah.
[40:45.940 --> 40:51.000]  So we both burned a bit, thank you Gavin, that was a wonderful gift, and I'm so happy I have two.
[40:51.280 --> 40:55.860]  I view it as in like, I had zero diamonds a week ago, and now I have two diamonds.
[40:56.500 --> 41:04.340]  There you go, there you go. You do, you have two shiny, glistening, uh, 18 carat diamonds, right there in front of you.
[41:04.600 --> 41:07.600]  Maybe if you hold onto them, in ten years, they'll be even, worth even more.
[41:08.120 --> 41:11.220]  Oh, that's true, I could keep mine sealed.
[41:11.560 --> 41:11.840]  Yeah.
[41:12.560 --> 41:16.400]  In mint condition, and uh, watch the other one. That's a great point.
[41:16.920 --> 41:22.500]  Oh, hey, I know something that we should mention, uh, that struck me the other day, um,
[41:22.500 --> 41:29.520]  we're talking about old lore, you know, we mentioned, uh, we mentioned the uh, the Variety article, and Eric sandbagging us and stuff.
[41:29.840 --> 41:36.120]  Uh, here's another one that just happened. Uh, I'm gonna officially declare, and Gavin I think you'll back me up on this,
[41:36.320 --> 41:42.500]  I'm gonna officially declare that climate change has beaten our curse.
[41:42.880 --> 41:43.520]  Yep, I would agree.
[41:44.260 --> 41:48.300]  Gavin and I have been hanging out a few times, and the weather has been gorgeous.
[41:48.480 --> 41:51.620]  We went swimming on the weekend, not a cloud in the sky.
[41:51.620 --> 41:58.300]  I think not even, not even the curse could withstand, uh, the carbon emissions.
[41:59.680 --> 42:00.120]  Really?
[42:00.520 --> 42:04.820]  I think we could potentially bring this temperature down if we just kept making plans though.
[42:05.140 --> 42:06.380]  Like eventually it's gonna get us.
[42:06.700 --> 42:08.600]  Maybe, yeah, well, we'll see, I don't know.
[42:09.020 --> 42:10.940]  But uh, I feel pretty good about it right now.
[42:11.080 --> 42:11.820]  What are you doing this weekend?
[42:12.480 --> 42:13.380]  Hanging out with you, I hope.
[42:13.640 --> 42:15.400]  Let's do it. Let's go swimming.
[42:16.000 --> 42:16.380]  Absolutely.
[42:17.200 --> 42:25.340]  Hey, if we're, if we're talking about stuff before we get into like the next thing, um, this comes out on...
[42:25.340 --> 42:28.820]  Nick, the exact date would be what, like the 23rd?
[42:29.040 --> 42:29.940]  22nd, 23rd.
[42:30.460 --> 42:33.500]  So this'll be a week before Geoff's new podcast launches.
[42:34.360 --> 42:37.160]  Geoff, you have a podcast coming out at the end of this month.
[42:37.400 --> 42:41.820]  See, Eric, this is why I love you and why I think you're the best, and why I don't even care about the variety thing,
[42:41.860 --> 42:43.300]  because you're such a fantastic producer.
[42:43.300 --> 42:46.300]  You know who did the variety thing, and it is not me.
[42:46.440 --> 42:48.720]  And it, and it confirms everything you felt.
[42:48.720 --> 42:52.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. For the record, for the record, but let me, let me nip this in the bud.
[42:53.580 --> 42:58.020]  Uh, that was all a joke. Don't, audiences, do not be mad at Eric for any of that.
[42:58.100 --> 42:59.140]  I was absolutely kidding.
[42:59.160 --> 42:59.560]  Oh, I don't give a fuck if they're mad at me.
[42:59.560 --> 43:01.900]  I, no, no, I know, but you don't need it. You don't need the aggravation.
[43:02.020 --> 43:03.280]  I know you don't care, but you don't need it.
[43:03.800 --> 43:06.880]  Uh, we, I, it absolutely wasn't Eric. That was just for comedy.
[43:06.940 --> 43:09.520]  I know, I'm pretty sure I'm the one who kept us out of that article.
[43:09.680 --> 43:10.700]  Uh, I, I do too.
[43:10.700 --> 43:11.780]  Uh, the...
[43:12.480 --> 43:13.000]  I want to know.
[43:13.100 --> 43:20.400]  Your, your new podcast comes out, and it's just, it's not, it won't be on the f*** face feed.
[43:20.740 --> 43:22.400]  It'll have its own RSS feed.
[43:22.680 --> 43:25.140]  Um, but we, maybe we'll put the first episode up.
[43:25.340 --> 43:27.880]  Nick had a really good idea. Put the first episode up on the f*** face feed, maybe.
[43:28.300 --> 43:29.620]  I think we don't need to vote on that.
[43:30.420 --> 43:35.380]  Okay, I mean, you know what, Gavin? Gavin, you're right, and let me say this.
[43:36.160 --> 43:39.920]  Myself, Gracie, and Nick, we, we abstain because this is your guys' show.
[43:39.920 --> 43:43.140]  As I've said many times, this is Andrew, Geoff, and Gavin.
[43:43.340 --> 43:44.600]  So I want you guys to take a vote.
[43:44.760 --> 43:51.100]  Should the first episode of Geoff's new podcast, So All Right, which is the name of the podcast, so, dot, dot, dot, All Right, name of the podcast.
[43:51.640 --> 43:54.840]  Should So All Right episode one go up on the f*** face feed?
[43:55.120 --> 43:56.680]  Well, obviously I'm voting no over to Andrew.
[43:58.040 --> 43:59.240]  Sorry, what are we voting on?
[44:01.200 --> 44:03.920]  Did I not just say exactly?
[44:04.560 --> 44:05.260]  No, here's the thing.
[44:05.580 --> 44:05.800]  Uh-huh?
[44:05.860 --> 44:06.620]  This is what happened.
[44:06.620 --> 44:12.600]  We're talking about Geoff's podcast, and my brain, which is not a f*** face thing, I don't think.
[44:12.660 --> 44:13.180]  Is it f*** face?
[44:13.240 --> 44:14.900]  It's under the f*** face umbrella.
[44:15.100 --> 44:16.040]  It's in the f*** face universe.
[44:16.920 --> 44:17.660]  It's just not a comedy.
[44:17.960 --> 44:20.720]  It's not necessarily a comedy podcast, but it exists.
[44:20.780 --> 44:21.420]  And I'm good, yeah.
[44:21.720 --> 44:24.760]  Okay, so Andrew votes yes, and Geoff, up to you.
[44:25.220 --> 44:25.580]  F***.
[44:26.880 --> 44:27.340]  Uh...
[44:27.340 --> 44:28.040]  Deciding vote.
[44:28.300 --> 44:30.520]  Because you have, now here's the thing.
[44:30.740 --> 44:36.080]  You can do something to help make your podcast very successful, or you can do the funniest thing.
[44:37.040 --> 44:37.820]  Right now.
[44:39.380 --> 44:41.280]  Yeah, I guess I gotta say no.
[44:43.600 --> 44:45.020]  That would be funnier, right?
[44:45.500 --> 44:46.480]  That would be way funnier.
[44:46.480 --> 44:50.600]  Oh, but this isn't f*** face, this is my own podcast, which I don't want to fail.
[44:53.080 --> 44:54.680]  Can I think about it?
[44:55.460 --> 44:58.780]  Can we vote if Geoff's podcast is in a different show's feed?
[44:59.460 --> 45:04.600]  Well, I mean, it will be in a different show's feed, because it will have its own feed.
[45:04.600 --> 45:07.340]  I really do want this podcast to do well, though.
[45:07.720 --> 45:11.000]  I would hate for it to be a failure.
[45:11.580 --> 45:12.740]  Yeah, you're right.
[45:12.980 --> 45:18.160]  I mean, the point was to try to get people to at least know about it, and this is going on much, much longer than I anticipated.
[45:18.180 --> 45:19.340]  Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
[45:19.600 --> 45:20.380]  I'm gonna say no.
[45:21.520 --> 45:22.620]  F***, I don't know.
[45:24.400 --> 45:27.700]  Nick, how are you feeling about the two to one no vote?
[45:28.340 --> 45:29.860]  Feeling pretty good.
[45:31.500 --> 45:32.760]  Well, if Nick's happy, then we're fine.
[45:32.760 --> 45:33.500]  No, that's not, no!
[45:35.440 --> 45:38.100]  Nick doesn't want it here, and he feels really happy about it.
[45:38.100 --> 45:39.300]  Yeah, he just f***ing said it.
[45:39.560 --> 45:44.800]  I was a little bit surprised to be stabbed in the back by Nick, but I guess he didn't, I guess he stabbed me in the face, not the back, so I appreciate that.
[45:45.740 --> 45:48.260]  And now we know who did the variety sound effect.
[45:51.460 --> 45:54.320]  Very unregulation, very non-regulation, Nick.
[45:56.020 --> 45:56.680]  Oh, man.
[45:59.100 --> 46:01.000]  Yeah, maybe check that podcast out if you want.
[46:01.000 --> 46:05.100]  It's just me. It's just me talking about shit that's maybe not as funny.
[46:06.160 --> 46:07.180]  I don't know.
[46:07.400 --> 46:08.860]  I found this picture the other day.
[46:09.040 --> 46:10.040]  Oh my god!
[46:10.300 --> 46:14.760]  It's me with Caleb on my back, and on Caleb's back is your cousin Chris.
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.980]  Oh, dude, that's at Bangers, right?
[46:18.480 --> 46:19.540]  Oh, it is! That's rainy!
[46:20.020 --> 46:21.700]  Yeah, that's rainy, too. We're getting lunch at Bangers.
[46:21.940 --> 46:24.620]  That must have been like 2014 or something, 15?
[46:25.040 --> 46:28.440]  That was such a fun time. That's when you and Chris used to wrestle a lot.
[46:29.680 --> 46:32.380]  Was this before or after you got bit on the tummy?
[46:32.840 --> 46:33.980]  This was probably after.
[46:34.500 --> 46:35.600]  Yeah, that's why you're smiling.
[46:36.100 --> 46:40.440]  If you'd have said that at one point I was giving Caleb a piggyback, I'd be like, what are you talking about?
[46:41.160 --> 46:42.820]  I have no memory of that whatsoever.
[46:43.240 --> 46:50.100]  I feel like a lot of the stuff, I feel like maybe every time I hung out with Caleb, he sort of erased my memory.
[46:50.380 --> 46:55.540]  I feel like I've hung out with him so many times, I just don't remember any of the details of any of it.
[46:55.540 --> 46:57.960]  It's so weird to see this world collide.
[46:58.160 --> 47:05.540]  My best friend, my favorite family member, and the closest, I mean just, I can't say enough good things about my cousin.
[47:05.660 --> 47:06.180]  And then Caleb.
[47:13.030 --> 47:13.750]  Caleb's great.
[47:15.190 --> 47:18.010]  Caleb is great, I love Caleb. I fucking love Caleb.
[47:18.630 --> 47:18.950]  Okay.
[47:19.250 --> 47:21.070]  I hired him, he worked for me for years.
[47:21.430 --> 47:22.010]  That's true.
[47:22.730 --> 47:23.510]  Then he's fucked off.
[47:24.310 --> 47:25.410]  What am I supposed to do?
[47:26.730 --> 47:29.330]  Can't give a dude a piggyback ride if he's on the other side of the country.
[47:31.410 --> 47:31.770]  Yeah.
[47:32.610 --> 47:33.290]  That's true.
[47:34.190 --> 47:34.890]  Technically, yeah.
[47:35.250 --> 47:35.870]  Are you...
[47:36.590 --> 47:37.110]  Go ahead.
[47:38.550 --> 47:39.870]  It's your show, baby, go for it.
[47:40.210 --> 47:40.550]  You go.
[47:40.810 --> 47:41.550]  I vote no.
[47:42.010 --> 47:42.370]  Okay.
[47:44.090 --> 47:50.650]  I was gonna say, we are getting close, we're not getting like two time, but by the time we get through this and everything...
[47:50.650 --> 47:51.470]  Oh, you're gonna end the show?
[47:51.930 --> 47:52.290]  No.
[47:52.570 --> 47:52.750]  Oh.
[47:52.930 --> 47:53.410]  Hang on.
[47:55.410 --> 47:56.790]  I wanna make sure that I...
[47:56.790 --> 47:57.390]  I mean, he did say it's our show.
[47:58.510 --> 48:04.710]  I wanna know what Geoff was doing in the lab, because it seemed like he had a lot of lab stuff or something.
[48:05.210 --> 48:05.510]  Oh.
[48:05.990 --> 48:06.790]  Yeah, that's true.
[48:07.130 --> 48:11.390]  So I don't know where we wanted to go, but I wanted to make sure, if that was teased, we should...
[48:11.390 --> 48:12.210]  Well, I gotta...
[48:12.210 --> 48:13.290]  If I'm guessing, pay it off.
[48:13.370 --> 48:16.710]  I gotta get to it today, because I can't wait a week. It won't keep.
[48:17.730 --> 48:24.250]  So, you know, we have been talking about, for the last couple weeks, about fruit combinations.
[48:24.810 --> 48:31.670]  And I'm the one that brought the idea of trying like uncommon fruit combinations to try to find...
[48:31.670 --> 48:31.790]  Yes.
[48:31.790 --> 48:36.390]  To unlock some sort of flavor explosion that people just don't know about yet, right?
[48:36.590 --> 48:46.550]  Thought that'd be a great exercise for us to use our inventor and creative skills and really focus it on something that could really benefit all of mankind.
[48:46.550 --> 48:53.930]  I think. And so, Andrew, you immediately got in the lab, and I was blown away by the work that you did and emboldened by it.
[48:54.030 --> 48:59.210]  And honestly, I was a little... maybe a little... I don't know.
[49:00.670 --> 49:01.030]  Inspired?
[49:01.570 --> 49:02.770]  No, more like...
[49:02.770 --> 49:03.030]  In awe?
[49:03.450 --> 49:08.530]  Yeah, kind of in awe, you know? A little less certain of myself after watching the solid work you did.
[49:08.830 --> 49:12.410]  And so I needed a little bit of time to work through some mental roadblocks.
[49:12.410 --> 49:17.330]  And the initial goal was to combine lemon and grape.
[49:18.130 --> 49:22.810]  I did a precursory search over the internet, found nothing. Then we talked about it.
[49:23.150 --> 49:26.670]  The community hit me up and let me know that there is such a thing.
[49:26.870 --> 49:33.050]  There is a grape-lemon product out there that no longer exists, but was very popular back in the day.
[49:33.190 --> 49:37.790]  It was from the 80s or the 90s, and it was this... I'm gonna put it in the...
[49:37.790 --> 49:40.430]  It was called Purplesaurus Rex.
[49:41.010 --> 49:41.850]  Oh, man!
[49:41.850 --> 49:45.790]  A flavor of Kool-Aid that combined grape and lemonade.
[49:46.190 --> 49:50.710]  And supposedly, from everything I've read, they say it was the...
[49:50.710 --> 49:54.710]  Oh, Eric remembers it. They say it was the best flavor of Kool-Aid ever made.
[49:55.090 --> 49:58.430]  I totally forgot about this.
[49:58.790 --> 49:59.510]  I never heard of it.
[49:59.770 --> 50:01.310]  It was so good.
[50:01.570 --> 50:05.430]  Yeah, it's weird that if it was as good as everybody on the internet says, that they would cancel it.
[50:06.030 --> 50:07.130]  Or discontinue it.
[50:07.130 --> 50:13.210]  Anyway, I looked around for it. It showed up a little while ago in a retro thing, but it's gone. It's not on the shelves.
[50:13.610 --> 50:18.010]  So I did a little bit of work, and I discovered that...
[50:18.010 --> 50:22.070]  I apologize for this sideward pick, but you're just gonna have to deal with it.
[50:23.090 --> 50:24.130]  So here's what we have.
[50:24.430 --> 50:25.150]  Come on.
[50:25.470 --> 50:29.270]  I found on the internet some people that said, here's how you can make your own Purplesaurus Rex.
[50:29.950 --> 50:32.130]  So they say you buy...
[50:32.650 --> 50:33.090]  Hold on.
[50:33.230 --> 50:34.670]  This isn't quite what I thought.
[50:34.710 --> 50:35.130]  I know.
[50:35.130 --> 50:35.430]  I know.
[50:35.550 --> 50:36.010]  We'll get there.
[50:36.430 --> 50:47.150]  Apparently you buy a packet of lemonade Kool-Aid and a packet of grape Kool-Aid, and then you combine them with sugar and the appropriate amount of water in a pitcher, and then they say it's essentially Purplesaurus Rex.
[50:47.610 --> 50:56.230]  And so here I am thinking, I can't invent or I can't improve upon this unless I test the OG flavor.
[50:56.390 --> 50:57.890]  Game recognizes game, right?
[50:58.590 --> 51:01.550]  So I need to whip up a pitcher of Purplesaurus Rex.
[51:01.610 --> 51:03.250]  Went to the store, bought all the ingredients, came home.
[51:03.250 --> 51:05.190]  I don't own a pitcher, turns out.
[51:05.250 --> 51:05.830]  Didn't know that.
[51:06.310 --> 51:07.550]  So I did the next best thing.
[51:07.630 --> 51:08.770]  I put it in a giant bowl.
[51:10.350 --> 51:13.030]  I mixed up a bunch of Purplesaurus Rex and I put it in a giant bowl.
[51:13.270 --> 51:15.370]  It has been cooling in my fridge.
[51:16.510 --> 51:17.530]  No, it's just a big metal bowl.
[51:17.610 --> 51:18.130]  It's not a dog bowl.
[51:18.410 --> 51:18.870]  It's round.
[51:19.050 --> 51:20.690]  I know it looks like a dog bowl, but it's not.
[51:21.390 --> 51:22.350]  And so I've got it in there.
[51:22.370 --> 51:24.510]  I haven't had a drop of it yet.
[51:24.550 --> 51:24.870]  I don't know.
[51:24.890 --> 51:26.650]  I wanted my first experience to be with y'all.
[51:26.990 --> 51:28.710]  But I wasn't done there.
[51:29.530 --> 51:30.310]  That's not enough for me.
[51:30.310 --> 51:32.190]  It looks like you've done all this prep on the wall, by the way.
[51:32.290 --> 51:32.950]  Just from the orientation.
[51:32.950 --> 51:33.630]  Yeah, I know.
[51:33.970 --> 51:34.610]  I apologize.
[51:34.970 --> 51:36.290]  It's only going to get worse, probably.
[51:37.570 --> 51:38.590]  You know how I roll.
[51:40.590 --> 51:45.270]  Then I was at breakfast this morning talking with Trevor from the day job.
[51:45.810 --> 51:51.350]  And I was explaining to him this process and an idea I had for another, which we'll get to.
[51:51.450 --> 51:52.290]  This is the third thing.
[51:52.310 --> 51:53.470]  I made three things today.
[51:53.650 --> 51:54.610]  It's the third thing I made.
[51:54.850 --> 52:00.230]  And I was talking to him about how kind of bummed I am that, you know, I couldn't really invent something that already existed.
[52:00.230 --> 52:00.510]  Right?
[52:01.010 --> 52:04.210]  At best, I could rediscover something that had been previously discovered.
[52:04.410 --> 52:05.890]  Which is important in its own right.
[52:05.950 --> 52:07.090]  And then we can shine light on it.
[52:07.310 --> 52:14.150]  And if Purple Source Rex is as good as they say it is, then we can shout it from the rafters and we can give it cosmic crisp kind of attention if we wanted to.
[52:15.210 --> 52:17.670]  But I still wanted to crack... I wanted to own something.
[52:17.810 --> 52:21.850]  Some kind of new... I wanted to break new ground in some way.
[52:22.130 --> 52:27.270]  And I was talking about how I really felt like it's in the grapes.
[52:27.270 --> 52:29.450]  There's something in the grapes that needs to come out.
[52:29.510 --> 52:30.230]  That needs to be discovered.
[52:30.610 --> 52:33.150]  And Trevor said, what about a suicide?
[52:34.270 --> 52:35.130]  And I thought, what do you mean?
[52:35.510 --> 52:41.930]  He goes, what if you got every kind of grape you could find and put them all into one drink?
[52:42.710 --> 52:43.350]  A suicide.
[52:43.950 --> 52:44.170]  Right?
[52:44.250 --> 52:45.830]  Like you used to do when you were a kid.
[52:45.910 --> 52:52.890]  When you would go to like the 7-Eleven and you would get a Big Gulp and you'd put every flavor of soda in at once.
[52:52.950 --> 52:53.130]  Yeah.
[52:53.230 --> 52:54.990]  In America, we used to call it a suicide when I was a kid.
[52:55.050 --> 52:55.130]  Huh.
[52:56.210 --> 52:57.530]  Maybe they don't do that anymore.
[52:57.890 --> 53:02.090]  And so I went and I bought six different kinds of grapes.
[53:02.390 --> 53:03.750]  I went to two grocery stores.
[53:04.170 --> 53:06.790]  I bought every different kind of grape I could find.
[53:07.190 --> 53:09.570]  And then I combined them with a little bit of ice.
[53:09.870 --> 53:12.510]  And I created a grape suicide.
[53:13.510 --> 53:14.990]  Is one of them cotton candy?
[53:15.210 --> 53:15.870]  No, Nick.
[53:15.910 --> 53:17.270]  They didn't have cotton candy anywhere.
[53:17.410 --> 53:18.050]  I looked for it.
[53:18.050 --> 53:18.730]  I couldn't find it.
[53:18.770 --> 53:19.910]  Maybe it's out of season or something.
[53:20.490 --> 53:23.190]  So I created, and I'll show you that in a second too.
[53:23.190 --> 53:25.610]  I created a grape suicide, which I want to try.
[53:26.030 --> 53:30.930]  But then, not to be, you gotta do things in odds, right?
[53:31.070 --> 53:32.230]  Like, evens don't work.
[53:32.430 --> 53:34.390]  When you invent something, you need to invent it in ones or threes.
[53:34.710 --> 53:44.850]  So I took that idea and I thought, instead of trying to find unexpected combinations between like a banana and a kumquat or, you know, or whatever.
[53:46.170 --> 53:53.170]  What nobody's really doing is nobody's creating the Noah's Ark of fruit drinks.
[53:54.090 --> 53:58.390]  Nobody's taking every single fruit on earth and combining it into one.
[53:59.630 --> 54:00.610]  Kind of like a...
[54:00.610 --> 54:03.370]  That almost made...
[54:03.370 --> 54:06.010]  Yeah, that sounds like Noah's Ark was like an orgy of animals.
[54:06.010 --> 54:08.690]  No, but Noah's Ark, they collected two of every animal, right?
[54:09.150 --> 54:11.190]  Mix the giraffe with that cat.
[54:11.350 --> 54:12.490]  I gotta see what we get out of this.
[54:12.690 --> 54:13.610]  To a point.
[54:13.710 --> 54:15.590]  I'm obviously not saying they put all the animals in a blender.
[54:15.870 --> 54:17.930]  But I'm saying I collected two of every fruit.
[54:18.050 --> 54:19.590]  Or actually, in my case, one of every fruit.
[54:20.330 --> 54:22.470]  And this is what that looked like.
[54:24.310 --> 54:25.710]  Oh my God.
[54:25.830 --> 54:45.770]  So what you've got right there is blueberries, pears, lemons, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, blackberries, watermelon, mango, six different kinds of grapes, two different kinds of peaches, two different kinds of nectarines, two different kinds of plums.
[54:46.370 --> 54:49.290]  You've got multiple kinds of melons.
[54:49.370 --> 54:49.870]  You've got apples.
[54:49.930 --> 54:51.830]  You've got a Cosmic Crisp right there in the front.
[54:51.830 --> 54:52.710]  You've got lemon.
[54:53.250 --> 54:53.970]  You've got lime.
[54:54.110 --> 54:54.990]  You've got oranges.
[54:55.330 --> 54:57.030]  You've got all kinds of stuff.
[54:57.090 --> 54:57.950]  There's actually more cherries in there.
[54:58.010 --> 54:58.990]  There's frozen cherries in the back too.
[54:59.070 --> 54:59.910]  You've got banana.
[55:00.450 --> 55:03.750]  You've got every kind of fruit I could find, right?
[55:04.170 --> 55:05.330]  And I put all those together.
[55:05.750 --> 55:06.590]  And I'm trying to decide.
[55:06.870 --> 55:11.950]  I was thinking Fruit of the Doom or Doom of the Loom could be a good title for it.
[55:12.230 --> 55:13.290]  This is what it looks like.
[55:13.290 --> 55:13.690]  I like Doom of the Loom.
[55:13.750 --> 55:14.410]  Doom of the Loom, right?
[55:14.450 --> 55:15.950]  This is what it looks like in the blender.
[55:17.410 --> 55:18.730]  That's packed with goodness.
[55:18.950 --> 55:20.410]  By the way, I did a little bit of reading on this.
[55:20.410 --> 55:22.410]  There are some fruits you should not combine.
[55:23.490 --> 55:25.050]  And all of those fruits are combined in this.
[55:25.310 --> 55:26.070]  Is it the kernel?
[55:26.690 --> 55:27.850]  Yeah, well, no, not kernel.
[55:27.950 --> 55:33.830]  But there's non-acidic fruits and acidic fruits when combined can cause digestive issues and acid reflux and stuff.
[55:33.970 --> 55:35.630]  So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this.
[55:35.890 --> 55:46.050]  But if you want to know what it looks like to combine almost to the cent $100 worth of fruit into one drink, this is it.
[55:46.230 --> 55:47.850]  It's the most expensive smoothie.
[55:48.110 --> 55:50.310]  You're not going to need any more vitamin C for a year.
[55:50.310 --> 55:52.110]  No, no, no, I won't.
[55:52.190 --> 55:56.530]  So on the left, we have Purple Source Rex Redux.
[55:57.010 --> 55:59.010]  In the middle, we have Grape Suicide.
[55:59.230 --> 56:01.690]  And on the right, we have Doom of the Loom.
[56:02.730 --> 56:05.630]  I now, I have not tasted any of this.
[56:05.870 --> 56:07.030]  It's just sitting in my fridge right now.
[56:07.070 --> 56:08.770]  If you'll give me a second, I'll go grab them.
[56:09.050 --> 56:09.210]  Please.
[56:09.750 --> 56:10.990]  I'll do a live taste test right now.
[56:11.130 --> 56:15.650]  In your blender picture, the Alexa is asking a very serious question.
[56:15.850 --> 56:16.730]  What is her question?
[56:17.830 --> 56:18.730]  Are you smarter?
[56:21.470 --> 56:23.350]  I think the answer is clearly no.
[56:23.470 --> 56:24.510]  I'll be right back.
[56:24.650 --> 56:25.290]  Okay, go get it.
[56:25.410 --> 56:25.590]  All right.
[56:25.850 --> 56:32.030]  Hey, while he's doing that, can we, any bets, any thoughts on which is going to be the best and which is going to be the worst?
[56:32.570 --> 56:34.930]  I think the grape mix is going to be pretty good.
[56:35.790 --> 56:38.030]  Oh, you're saying the grape suicide is the best one?
[56:38.170 --> 56:40.370]  I think it'll be pretty good, yeah.
[56:40.390 --> 56:43.070]  I don't ever want to, I feel like I never want to drink a grape.
[56:43.450 --> 56:45.230]  I just, that's not the right format for a grape.
[56:45.330 --> 56:46.410]  I think that's going to be the worst.
[56:46.770 --> 56:48.430]  I think me and Nick are on the same page.
[56:48.430 --> 56:51.670]  I think Geoff is white trash enough to love this Kool-Aid he's about to slam.
[56:52.030 --> 56:58.590]  I think he's going to, I think he's going to taste this and he's going to go, oh, it's going to be like a lot of sugar and that's what he wants.
[56:59.310 --> 57:02.950]  We all agree that the all fruit one is going to be the worst, right?
[57:03.610 --> 57:04.190]  Tip of the loom.
[57:04.330 --> 57:07.850]  I hope it's the best because it's so inconvenient to make.
[57:07.950 --> 57:09.790]  Like, what if that's his favorite drink?
[57:10.050 --> 57:13.050]  He just always craves a hundred dollar smoothie.
[57:13.470 --> 57:16.970]  It's a hundred dollar smoothie is his favorite one.
[57:18.670 --> 57:19.030]  Okay.
[57:19.210 --> 57:22.950]  So, uh, first off out the gate, uh, I'm a little worried.
[57:23.090 --> 57:27.750]  The grape, the grape suicide seems to have separated liquid from goop.
[57:27.990 --> 57:29.110]  Oh, no.
[57:29.490 --> 57:31.850]  I mean, you should definitely get the goop out of there.
[57:31.970 --> 57:32.750]  You shouldn't.
[57:32.790 --> 57:33.570]  Oh, just give it a mix.
[57:33.870 --> 57:36.050]  Give it a nice little stir.
[57:36.110 --> 57:36.430]  I'm going to go.
[57:36.510 --> 57:37.350]  I'm going to start at the beginning.
[57:37.530 --> 57:38.530]  I'm going to start with the OG.
[57:38.770 --> 57:46.270]  I'm going to start with the Purple Source Rex, which, by the way, I'd like to say, uh, I basically, what I did here is I took inspiration from Jurassic Park.
[57:46.270 --> 57:56.770]  I did some dino DNA and I, I went to the 80s and I found the amber of a, of a brilliant drink and I brought it back into our time and I recreated it.
[57:57.090 --> 57:59.670]  And much like a, you know, that dude in the thing.
[58:00.050 --> 58:00.670]  Let me try right now.
[58:01.070 --> 58:01.610]  Do you have a webcam?
[58:02.150 --> 58:02.330]  Yeah.
[58:02.370 --> 58:02.770]  You want one?
[58:03.070 --> 58:03.290]  Yeah.
[58:03.610 --> 58:07.730]  Also, the Jurassic Park analogy, if we follow through that, it kills you.
[58:07.930 --> 58:08.330]  You die.
[58:08.730 --> 58:11.870]  I mean, I wasn't, Andrew, I was going to like, let him go all the way down that road.
[58:11.970 --> 58:12.990]  I see what you're saying.
[58:13.190 --> 58:13.670]  Yeah, that's fine.
[58:13.670 --> 58:16.590]  I mean, I understand that it kills you, but I don't know that this won't kill me.
[58:17.070 --> 58:18.350]  The hammer didn't die though, did he?
[58:18.510 --> 58:19.510]  No, Hammond did not die.
[58:20.290 --> 58:20.670]  Did he?
[58:20.950 --> 58:21.450]  In the book.
[58:21.750 --> 58:22.470]  No, not in that movie.
[58:22.790 --> 58:24.330]  I mean, he's dead by now. He's very old then.
[58:24.550 --> 58:29.530]  Alright, so here we go. This is, uh, this is, uh, home-brewed Purple Source Rex Redux.
[58:31.890 --> 58:33.270]  We're looking at the face.
[58:33.510 --> 58:33.950]  Oh, he's going in.
[58:34.130 --> 58:34.430]  Judgment.
[58:34.710 --> 58:36.870]  I saw, I saw a girl with a straw. Oh, he's got quite a big sip.
[58:37.090 --> 58:37.690]  Oh, that looks good.
[58:37.690 --> 58:38.430]  Oh, that looks good.
[58:38.530 --> 58:39.670]  It looks like he loves this.
[58:39.770 --> 58:40.970]  Oh, he's going in for a second sip.
[58:40.970 --> 58:41.410]  He's going to finish this, I think.
[58:41.410 --> 58:42.830]  He's going to finish this, I think.
[58:42.830 --> 58:44.030]  I fucking told you.
[58:44.030 --> 58:45.310]  He's demolished it.
[58:45.310 --> 58:46.430]  I fucking told you.
[58:46.710 --> 58:47.710]  Even with the ice in.
[58:49.590 --> 58:50.630]  Holy shit!
[58:51.270 --> 58:52.150]  That's good!
[58:53.330 --> 58:54.770]  That's fucking good!
[58:54.950 --> 58:55.390]  I told you.
[58:55.390 --> 58:55.930]  I told you.
[58:56.090 --> 58:57.250]  Oh my god!
[58:57.630 --> 59:04.010]  Geoff is like from the South, and this is just, this is just, it's hummingbird food.
[59:06.070 --> 59:11.050]  Now, when you say you're a Kool-Aid guy generally, Geoff, or is this like Captain Two?
[59:11.050 --> 59:16.830]  Dude, I grew up in the 80s, I was a Kool-Aid kid, I don't think I've had Kool-Aid in 25 years.
[59:16.990 --> 59:18.990]  Oh my god, what have I been missing?
[59:20.950 --> 59:22.950]  So summer of 98 was the last time?
[59:23.190 --> 59:23.850]  Yeah, I know.
[59:24.590 --> 59:26.030]  I guess it was a lot older than that.
[59:27.090 --> 59:31.390]  I guess I thought we got to a point where we didn't have to mix our drinks anymore, you could buy them premixed.
[59:31.550 --> 59:33.050]  Fuck that, dude, I'm going back to mixing.
[59:33.610 --> 59:34.970]  Oh shit, that's good.
[59:35.770 --> 59:37.130]  So it's just straight sugar.
[59:37.230 --> 59:39.070]  Can you talk about the flavor of it?
[59:39.150 --> 59:40.690]  Like mixing the purple with the yellow?
[59:40.690 --> 59:42.030]  How much sugar went in?
[59:42.250 --> 59:43.290]  Dude, it tastes like a purple dinosaur.
[59:43.730 --> 59:58.690]  It was one packet of unsweetened lemonade, one packet of unsweetened grape, then four quarts of water and two cups of sugar.
[01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:02.010]  Two cups?!
[01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:05.850]  Well, that's what the recipe is for fucking Kool-Aid.
[01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:09.330]  It's two quarts of water, a packet, and one cup of sugar.
[01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:10.750]  Or sweetened, or whatever.
[01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:13.130]  Of course he fucking loved it.
[01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:13.770]  This is insane.
[01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:14.970]  It's so good!
[01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:16.990]  I can see why you've activated.
[01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:21.430]  Oh man, I'm into it.
[01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:22.670]  Oh, fucking...
[01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:24.610]  I'm gonna get a fucking sugar boater.
[01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.490]  God damn.
[01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:28.510]  You just walked out of a club bathroom.
[01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:33.170]  Now we'll move on to...
[01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:35.210]  Oh, he's stirring it up. He's mixing the goop.
[01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:38.290]  Alright, it's mixed up now, you can't see how it's...
[01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:39.630]  You can see the grit.
[01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.530]  So this is the all-grape one?
[01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:49.570]  This is homage to Trevor, he was instrumental in this, this was his initial burst of idea.
[01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:51.510]  This is grape suicide.
[01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:57.530]  Six different kinds of grape, from concord to green to other stuff.
[01:00:58.030 --> 01:01:02.890]  Are you gonna suck from the middle of the cup for the best consistency, or are you gonna go from the bottom?
[01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:04.510]  Middle of the cup.
[01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:04.890]  Okay.
[01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:11.030]  Oh, it's not as thick as I was expecting. It seemed to glide right in.
[01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:14.230]  It's like a frothy grape juice.
[01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:17.950]  Doesn't taste any better or worse than any grape juice I've ever had.
[01:01:18.310 --> 01:01:19.050]  Tastes fresh.
[01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.670]  They're all pretty similar tasting, don't you think?
[01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:30.070]  I don't think so, because Emily will eat green grapes but won't touch a red grape, which is fucking weird to me.
[01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:32.130]  That's crazy and backwards.
[01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:34.730]  It was good.
[01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:39.830]  Not better than just going and buying... well, that's not true.
[01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:40.830]  It's good.
[01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:44.070]  I'm gonna give Purple Source Rex a 10 out of 10.
[01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:47.530]  I'm gonna give grape suicide a...
[01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:50.110]  8.7.
[01:01:50.530 --> 01:01:50.930]  Oh wow.
[01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:52.190]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:57.150]  But I don't know that I would... it's a lot of effort to go in when you can just buy grape juice.
[01:01:57.350 --> 01:02:01.490]  But certainly it's not the most effort which you're about to get into now.
[01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:07.410]  This is something like... this is something like 35 different fruits combined.
[01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:08.910]  That is vibrant.
[01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:12.570]  Everything turns into grape, apparently.
[01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:18.810]  How are your ratios? Do you think you've balanced it out well or do you think one's gonna be overpowering?
[01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:21.450]  Oh dude, I just... I have no fucking clue.
[01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:26.150]  I'm so excited.
[01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:27.930]  I don't know. I really don't know.
[01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:31.610]  I had no idea how to gauge how much or how little of certain things.
[01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:33.650]  No clue.
[01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.610]  I wish I could be tasting these.
[01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:39.950]  Here it goes. He's preparing.
[01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:41.450]  Deep breath.
[01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:45.290]  This might be the first $100 smoothie anyone's ever drank.
[01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:49.070]  It's the Jimmy Butler of smoothies.
[01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:54.650]  Oh, look at the way it got stuck halfway up the straw. This one's thick.
[01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:58.370]  Oh, it seems chunky.
[01:02:58.530 --> 01:02:59.910]  But maybe a good chunk.
[01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:01.290]  There could be a good chunk.
[01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:04.070]  Oh.
[01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:09.090]  He seems perplexed.
[01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:09.970]  And not a bad one.
[01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:11.470]  Oh, that looked a little bad.
[01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:13.390]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:18.910]  It tastes identical to every purple smoothie I've ever bought.
[01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:21.430]  Oh, that's so disappointing.
[01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:23.330]  Jamba Juice or Juice Land.
[01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:27.610]  It doesn't taste $90 more expensive than the last smoothie.
[01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:30.630]  Yeah, it's a $100, $18 smoothie is what you've got there.
[01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:32.670]  It's a $100, $9 smoothie.
[01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:33.510]  Oh my god.
[01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.110]  I mean, it's good. Don't get me wrong.
[01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:38.410]  Even though it's a lot of fruit, I'm supposed to not combine, apparently.
[01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:45.610]  I mean, it's fine as a smoothie, but you can save yourself $95.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.220]  That was fantastic.
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:51.760]  A little bitter.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.580]  This might be the best lab work anyone's ever done.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.260]  Oh man, thank you so much.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:58.740]  That's really kind of you.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.260]  I don't know if it can compare to Sleep Sneaky, but I really appreciate that.
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.360]  Sorry, maybe I didn't hear it.
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:05.140]  Was there a number rating that you ascribed to this?
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.620]  Oh, I'll give it a...
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:08.620]  It's us. It's an 8.
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:11.280]  So a 10, an 8.7, and an 8.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.340]  It's the worst of the three.
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.880]  Yeah, it's like doing an episode of AMO.
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.680]  Everything is a 10 or...
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.580]  As high as a 10 or as low as a 7.7.
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.360]  And that was good tonight.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:24.380]  Alright, well there you go.
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.500]  That was very informative.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:35.440]  Unless I'm struck by some brilliant idea in the shower or like in a dream, I think I might be done combining fruit.
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.460]  Oh man, there's so much acid.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.820]  Oh, it's coming back? It's fighting you now?
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:44.040]  Do you think you could have used the gloves for the fruit?
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.540]  Yeah, I could have used the fruit gloves if they existed.
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:48.840]  Dude, fuck. Hold on a second.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.580]  Here's a... turn my camera back on.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:56.460]  What do we... what do we look... oh, he's really...
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:00.620]  This is the basket is full of all the ingredients for the fruit gloves.
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:06.960]  It's so much stuff. I got so many gadgets and so much fruit gloves.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:07.740]  Is that a light?
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.000]  Yeah, I've got some... look at this. Look at this guy.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.500]  I've got so much stuff.
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:17.280]  He's gonna have a blender on one end of it.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.280]  Look at these little knives. I've got so much stuff to put this...
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.280]  It became overwhelming, but...
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.340]  I'm gonna get back to it. I'm gonna do it.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.140]  If you can make those heat gloves, I can make the fruit gloves.
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:28.540]  Oh yeah.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:35.480]  You would have more gadgets in your hand than Inspector Gadget as a whole, based off of what you have in that basket.
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:37.580]  That sounds crazy.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:38.640]  That sounds accurate to me, yes.
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.780]  It's gonna be fruit's worst nightmare.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:48.420]  Oh man, that's a really acidic smoothie. God damn, you want a base of some kind.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.820]  I think you might be in trouble if you finish that smoothie.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.200]  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not gonna finish it. I'm not gonna finish it.
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:59.420]  I just had 7,000 calories of Purplesaurus Rex.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:02.640]  You had a whole cup of sugar.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:06.900]  We should probably start... you should wrap up, because that was...
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:09.500]  Do you think we'll be serving Purplesaurus Rex in the next RTX?
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:10.860]  I think we should.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:14.000]  Or when we do our f*** face meetup someday.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.640]  I think it would be a bad idea to serve grape suicide.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:23.000]  I wasn't gonna say anything, I was just gonna kinda like let it be like Jonestown, but whatever.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:23.920]  Yeah, I was gonna say.
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:26.960]  We'll do Purplesaurus Rex, that's a good one. It already exists.
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.340]  It's the 10 out of the 3.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.900]  Can you imagine if that's why they discontinued the Kool-Aid flavor?
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:39.500]  Because it was the Jonestown flavor, the choice, or whatever.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.980]  It was really bad branding for the product.
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:47.140]  It's like you find out Heaven's Gate was really into Purplesaurus Rex.
[01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:50.020]  Oh man.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:54.020]  Yeah, I guess we should probably wrap it up then.
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.560]  Anybody else have any last thoughts?
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.020]  No, nothing can top that show. That was fantastic.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.720]  I'll tell you a funny little story that happened to me today.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.080]  Okay.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:07.480]  I got up this morning to go meet Trevor for breakfast and to run some errands.
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:11.600]  I got up, and I took a shower, and I got dressed, and I did my hair and everything.
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.460]  And I was walking out the door, and I looked in the mirror, and my hair was a little floppy.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:20.280]  So I thought, I'll go throw some of Emily's hairspray on my hair, and then I'll take off.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:25.620]  So I ran into the bathroom, and I grabbed some of her hairspray, and I sprayed it in my hair, and then I just ran out the door.
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:35.140]  And as I was leaving, I saw my face, just a hint of my face in the mirror by my front door, and it scared the shit out of me.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.240]  And I stopped, and I turned, and I looked, and my hair was white.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:41.400]  Like, I had gone gray in a second, and I couldn't figure out what I was looking at.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.240]  I have, like, white and salt-and-pepper hair, and I was like, I just...
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:48.780]  The entirety of my head turned gray in one second.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:54.460]  Like, I must have had some crazy trauma getting from the bathroom to the front door that I didn't... that I lost time, you know?
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:59.460]  Like, maybe I was abducted by aliens for three or four weeks, and then they put me right back down, you know, ten seconds later, and I didn't realize that.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:07:59.680]  Whatever.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:05.780]  Anyway, and it took me probably 15 seconds of looking at it to realize I had done something with the hairspray to myself.
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:06.960]  Clearly, it must have been it.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:11.580]  So I ran back into the bathroom, and I looked at it, and apparently, I didn't use hairspray.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:15.900]  I used this thing called dry shampoo, which I guess is... I don't know.
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.940]  I've never used it before.
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:19.100]  But I couldn't get it out.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:24.300]  And I was late to go... I was late to run my errands and to go see Trevor, and I couldn't get it out.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:27.260]  And so I had to leave the house with, like, partially gray hair today.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:31.160]  I just aged myself for no fucking reason.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:35.280]  I've started doing a thing where every time I see myself in the mirror, I give myself a little smile.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:36.760]  Yeah?
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:39.780]  Yeah. I give myself a little nod. Like, alright.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.020]  That's great, dude.
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:45.120]  What did you try to do to get dry shampoo out?
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:49.900]  Uh, I tried to, like, rub it out forever, and that didn't help, and that didn't help.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  So I put some water in, and that didn't really help, so I just left.
[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:59.340]  I had places to be, and I figured I'll just be an older guy than I am today.
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:02.040]  I wish I'd have taken a photo. It's fine now.
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:06.700]  But, uh, it didn't cross my mind because I was in a hurry to take a photo or whatever.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.580]  It was shocking, because it looked real.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.660]  Was Trevor wondering how long it had been since he last saw you?
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.720]  Yeah. He's like, what the fuck?
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:15.940]  It's been a hard six months.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:21.280]  He did the transition shot in the end of Saving Private Ryan in five minutes.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:28.420]  Oh, man. What a fun episode this one was.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.040]  That was great. Yeah. Great time.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.800]  I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed it. We've been on a roll lately.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:38.520]  I had such a good time doing the definitive music and movie list for the Summer of 98 last week.
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.880]  Have we talked about what those are and when they're coming out?
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.980]  No, and we will next time.
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:48.360]  Well, there you go. Tune in next time to find out what the fuck that is. Bye!
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:53.740]  Hey, guys, Major League fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.840]  More fruit talk. Those are some freaky tomatoes.
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.820]  Eric is a huge fan of Discord.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.120]  Who has the best title? Is it time for butt cream?
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.760]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:07.660]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
