[00:00.000 --> 00:01.940]  Speaking of bangers, Geoff, you should check your door.
[00:02.980 --> 00:03.340]  Uh...
[00:03.340 --> 00:03.940]  There's a package.
[00:04.060 --> 00:04.220]  What?
[00:04.640 --> 00:05.860]  Okay, hold on. I'll be right back.
[00:05.880 --> 00:07.020]  Is that why the door opened earlier?
[00:07.320 --> 00:08.400]  Yeah, what the fuck?
[00:08.980 --> 00:10.300]  You think his butt cream's arrived already?
[00:12.600 --> 00:13.900]  What is about to happen?
[00:14.040 --> 00:15.400]  Oh, who could... who knows?
[00:16.180 --> 00:17.100]  Why don't I have a package?
[00:17.580 --> 00:20.840]  Uh, well, you know, I should've, actually. You're right. It's on me.
[00:21.820 --> 00:23.440]  I don't have your address saved.
[00:23.760 --> 00:24.340]  That's fair.
[00:24.460 --> 00:24.880]  That's why.
[00:25.460 --> 00:29.700]  So either Andrew or Gracie is a goddamn magician. I'll tell you that right now.
[00:30.000 --> 00:30.660]  What happened?
[00:30.760 --> 00:31.800]  That's impressive.
[00:32.140 --> 00:34.000]  Hold on.
[00:34.660 --> 00:36.260]  Gracie said, it ain't me.
[00:37.260 --> 00:38.460]  That's impressive.
[00:38.580 --> 00:39.680]  Do you have potato smiles?
[00:40.120 --> 00:41.500]  Do you have fucking potato smiles?
[00:41.980 --> 00:43.120]  Okay, hold on.
[00:46.020 --> 00:49.340]  The most aggressive anyone's ever asked that.
[00:51.080 --> 00:52.000]  Put it in the slack.
[00:52.700 --> 00:53.020]  No!
[00:54.500 --> 00:57.960]  I'm gonna be eating potato smiles for dinner, apparently.
[00:58.100 --> 00:58.900]  Holy shit!
[00:59.400 --> 01:01.400]  It's like a little happy hash browns.
[01:01.480 --> 01:05.000]  That's so crazy, and it costs you like a thousand dollars to do that?
[01:05.620 --> 01:05.980]  That's awesome.
[01:05.980 --> 01:06.600]  132, I think.
[01:06.700 --> 01:07.820]  That's awesome, dude.
[01:08.840 --> 01:09.180]  You're welcome.
[01:09.280 --> 01:10.240]  Was that you, Andrew, I'm assuming?
[01:10.320 --> 01:10.540]  It was.
[01:10.540 --> 01:12.060]  Thank you so much for my potato smiles.
[01:12.320 --> 01:13.440]  Dude, you got that moving.
[01:14.060 --> 01:16.660]  Dude, you've put a flesh smile on my face.
[01:20.040 --> 01:22.940]  To take us out of the episode, will you open that bag and eat one right now?
[01:23.240 --> 01:23.600]  Frozen?
[01:23.760 --> 01:25.860]  No. Don't ruin potato smiles immediately.
[01:27.080 --> 01:28.020]  I think you should try it.
[01:28.020 --> 01:28.720]  Yes!
[01:28.960 --> 01:30.560]  A frozen fry is awful.
[01:31.220 --> 01:32.820]  Hold on, let me, uh...
[01:32.820 --> 01:36.200]  Fries don't cool well. You need to have those hot.
[01:36.700 --> 01:38.500]  It's a big drop-off in quality, in my experience.
[01:38.520 --> 01:39.560]  Alright, can you see my camera?
[01:39.980 --> 01:41.220]  Okay, yeah, you look good, man.
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.720]  Wearing my NBA Summer League hat. You guys were there.
[01:46.420 --> 01:47.140]  Sloppy Joe shirt.
[01:47.420 --> 01:48.160]  Alright, here we go.
[01:48.900 --> 01:49.880]  Oh yeah, Sloppy Joe's.
[01:50.200 --> 01:51.520]  It's just my travel clothes this year.
[01:52.140 --> 01:54.680]  Alright, it's a pretty happy little face.
[01:57.940 --> 01:59.100]  It's very frozen.
[02:00.320 --> 02:02.020]  Yeah, it's a frozen product.
[02:02.280 --> 02:04.180]  Just gnaw on it for a little bit.
[02:06.620 --> 02:09.580]  And this is what makes Geoff have his next root canal.
[02:13.920 --> 02:16.600]  Nick came back and said, what the fuck?
[02:19.220 --> 02:20.780]  I almost threw up a little bit.
[02:21.500 --> 02:22.280]  It's just a lot in my mouth.
[02:22.540 --> 02:24.120]  There's a lot going on, but it's good.
[02:24.120 --> 02:27.120]  I'm gonna try it thawed and heated, and I bet it'll be even better.
[02:27.520 --> 02:28.240]  It will be.
[02:28.800 --> 02:29.200]  That's great.
[02:29.480 --> 02:30.680]  We should enjoy your smiles.
[02:31.280 --> 02:31.880]  I'm excited.
