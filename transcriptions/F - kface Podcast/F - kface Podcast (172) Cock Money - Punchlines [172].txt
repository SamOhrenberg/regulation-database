[00:10.450 --> 00:13.810]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the...
[00:13.810 --> 00:14.090]  What?
[00:14.370 --> 00:14.570]  Fuck.
[00:14.970 --> 00:15.850]  I'm not recording. One sec.
[00:16.150 --> 00:16.510]  Give me a sec.
[00:16.630 --> 00:17.730]  It's f-fuckin' what?
[00:18.770 --> 00:20.290]  Three o'clock on a Thursday.
[00:20.790 --> 00:22.510]  Yeah, but, well, first of all...
[00:22.510 --> 00:24.930]  Let me record. Let me hit record, then I can yell.
[00:26.430 --> 00:28.630]  Now I'm recording. First of all...
[00:28.630 --> 00:31.750]  Start of the NFL season, both of you rejected my huddle.
[00:32.070 --> 00:34.410]  I'm hurt... as we begin this show.
[00:34.930 --> 00:35.910]  I didn't get a huddle.
[00:36.190 --> 00:36.910]  Oh, I didn't get invite.
[00:37.230 --> 00:39.250]  I invited both of you to a huddle,
[00:39.250 --> 00:42.990]  and I sat there for 10 minutes by myself, huddle-less.
[00:43.370 --> 00:45.570]  I got last week's huddle invite, and I was there.
[00:45.970 --> 00:48.670]  I never got last week's or this week's huddle invite, dude.
[00:48.730 --> 00:50.050]  I don't know where I'm supposed to get it.
[00:50.370 --> 00:51.690]  Where do the huddle invites go?
[00:51.770 --> 00:53.770]  Because that was... that was... it was an absent huddle.
[00:54.070 --> 00:55.830]  I would have loved to be in a huddle,
[00:55.910 --> 00:57.470]  especially for opening day, right?
[00:57.590 --> 01:00.070]  Tonight's the first night of the fuckin' season, isn't it?
[01:00.070 --> 01:03.770]  A huddle, by the way, is like a Slack audio call or something.
[01:05.170 --> 01:07.770]  My phone nor my computer, both of which were in front of me,
[01:07.990 --> 01:09.090]  alerted me to any kind of huddle.
[01:09.090 --> 01:11.330]  It was a rare bath-time huddle for me.
[01:11.590 --> 01:14.390]  I was still in the bath, I was just trying to get ready for the show.
[01:15.190 --> 01:18.070]  Can I say, if I do huddle with the two of you,
[01:18.130 --> 01:19.290]  I want you to be in the bathtub.
[01:20.230 --> 01:21.250]  I can make that happen.
[01:21.690 --> 01:22.170]  I like that.
[01:22.530 --> 01:23.430]  I can promise that.
[01:24.350 --> 01:25.370]  Hey, hold on a second.
[01:25.910 --> 01:28.470]  Let me... let me do some... let me take care of some business real fast.
[01:28.630 --> 01:29.150]  Hold on just a second.
[01:29.790 --> 01:32.610]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:32.810 --> 01:33.970]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:34.170 --> 01:38.110]  With me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[01:38.110 --> 01:42.430]  This is episode 172.
[01:42.950 --> 01:44.050]  Ooh, we're almost there.
[01:44.810 --> 01:46.110]  To where? What do you mean?
[01:46.530 --> 01:46.910]  I don't know.
[01:47.510 --> 01:48.950]  196, that's going to be the banger.
[01:49.170 --> 01:51.950]  That's the one that we've agreed is going to be the...
[01:52.550 --> 01:55.550]  I think there needs to be a location for you to say we're almost there.
[01:57.730 --> 02:00.170]  I think it applies somehow indefinitely.
[02:01.030 --> 02:04.030]  We have 24 episodes before we get to 196.
[02:04.850 --> 02:07.290]  That is... that's like almost a half a year.
[02:08.510 --> 02:09.070]  That's crazy.
[02:09.250 --> 02:09.510]  Really?
[02:09.990 --> 02:13.570]  We're not going to get to 196 until like the winter.
[02:13.730 --> 02:15.590]  I think January, February, somewhere around there.
[02:15.990 --> 02:17.570]  Oh, wow. Winter of 24.
[02:19.470 --> 02:20.590]  It's going to be a great year.
[02:22.010 --> 02:24.070]  It's coming back. The good years are coming back.
[02:24.590 --> 02:28.030]  What if we did... what if we did a summer of one day,
[02:28.090 --> 02:31.090]  but we do it for a year in the future and then we just guess
[02:31.090 --> 02:32.610]  what all the best stuff is going to be?
[02:33.950 --> 02:36.970]  Ooh, like... like Will Smith's going to... Will Smith and DJ Jazzy Geoff
[02:36.970 --> 02:38.630]  are getting back together in 2026.
[02:38.750 --> 02:41.390]  They're coming out with a song called Toledo, and it's going to be...
[02:41.390 --> 02:42.350]  Everybody's going to love it.
[02:42.590 --> 02:44.910]  If we say enough shit, we'll eventually be right about something.
[02:45.430 --> 02:47.170]  Yeah. I just want to know where we're going.
[02:47.270 --> 02:49.670]  I'm still stuck up on that. I hate long, hard rides.
[02:49.890 --> 02:52.890]  I need a location. I need to know roughly how far...
[02:53.590 --> 02:55.810]  We going to 196? Is it the big thing?
[02:57.070 --> 02:58.310]  Well, and beyond. 197?
[02:58.870 --> 03:02.590]  OK, but we need... there needs to be a pit stop somewhere along the way.
[03:03.830 --> 03:06.610]  Do you want to take a pit stop at like 182?
[03:06.970 --> 03:07.530]  I like that.
[03:07.650 --> 03:11.670]  Just to like sort of take note of where we are and how close to 182 we are.
[03:12.170 --> 03:15.950]  How about for 182, we all record in a different location,
[03:16.070 --> 03:19.850]  a unique location that we can share for 182, where the pit stops are.
[03:20.050 --> 03:21.870]  Now, that's interesting. That's interesting.
[03:22.150 --> 03:24.470]  What if you record in a different location?
[03:24.610 --> 03:26.910]  What if I record at Gavin's house and he records at my house?
[03:28.410 --> 03:29.510]  Oh, that's an option.
[03:29.650 --> 03:31.610]  Listen, I want it. I want it to be a mystery.
[03:31.710 --> 03:32.870]  I want it to be a big reveal.
[03:32.990 --> 03:36.130]  So you might do that, but I'm I'm going to not lock that in for me.
[03:36.130 --> 03:40.330]  I'm going to say in my head they could be anywhere and we'll see what happens
[03:40.330 --> 03:41.030]  when the episode comes.
[03:41.090 --> 03:43.570]  What episode is it? 182? 184? Which one?
[03:44.590 --> 03:45.890]  184, I think. OK.
[03:46.810 --> 03:47.410]  Oh, I'm excited.
[03:47.990 --> 03:50.050]  I think I said 182, but 184 feels better.
[03:50.450 --> 03:55.130]  I need a pit stop because it's been 183 episodes of just driving,
[03:55.290 --> 03:56.710]  just nonstop going.
[03:57.310 --> 04:00.590]  That's like and I didn't even pick it for this, but 184 would be the halfway point
[04:00.590 --> 04:02.610]  between 172 and 186, I think.
[04:02.810 --> 04:04.470]  So that's perfect.
[04:05.030 --> 04:05.950]  There you go.
[04:05.970 --> 04:06.670]  It's fantastic.
[04:06.690 --> 04:08.310]  I mean, you make it sound like you want to stop.
[04:09.450 --> 04:11.170]  No, I don't want to permanently stop.
[04:11.250 --> 04:13.130]  I want to stretch my legs a little bit.
[04:13.270 --> 04:16.410]  I want to want to take a little break, maybe use the bathroom.
[04:16.630 --> 04:17.630]  What does that mean, though?
[04:17.870 --> 04:18.770]  What does that mean?
[04:19.070 --> 04:23.370]  I'm viewing this podcast as Gavin saying we're almost there.
[04:23.470 --> 04:27.330]  That makes me think of being like a kid in the car going like, are we there yet?
[04:27.370 --> 04:28.970]  And him going, oh, we're almost there.
[04:29.370 --> 04:32.490]  So I'm envisioning this entire podcast as a road trip now.
[04:32.610 --> 04:34.190]  And we have not taken any breaks.
[04:34.190 --> 04:35.630]  And I hate very long car rides.
[04:35.790 --> 04:39.290]  So a little little break to get a snack or like stretch the legs would be good.
[04:39.750 --> 04:42.330]  Is Gavin Ice Cube in this scenario?
[04:43.290 --> 04:45.970]  Oh, I think Ice Cube drove the car.
[04:46.130 --> 04:47.030]  So I don't think so.
[04:47.270 --> 04:48.490]  Well, why don't we just do this?
[04:48.750 --> 04:51.990]  When we get to 196, we'll all get in a car together.
[04:52.130 --> 04:53.670]  It's 184, isn't it?
[04:53.670 --> 04:54.890]  Oh, 184. All right.
[04:54.990 --> 04:55.910]  Well, we'll get a car together.
[04:56.150 --> 04:58.530]  We'll hit play on F*** Face episode one.
[04:58.970 --> 04:59.750]  Just let it continue.
[04:59.970 --> 05:01.410]  Let them all play and see how far we get.
[05:02.650 --> 05:03.510]  Oh, that sounds terrible.
[05:04.030 --> 05:06.070]  Yeah, it sounds like a really bad idea.
[05:06.070 --> 05:09.550]  I don't understand what the plan is there to just play the old episodes.
[05:10.190 --> 05:11.270]  Listen to them in the car.
[05:11.330 --> 05:13.150]  See how far we can get before we get up to where we are.
[05:13.490 --> 05:14.030]  Eight minutes.
[05:14.350 --> 05:15.210]  But where are we going?
[05:15.350 --> 05:15.850]  Before I want out of the car.
[05:15.850 --> 05:17.350]  I still don't know where we're going.
[05:19.010 --> 05:20.390]  Where are we going, Gavin?
[05:20.630 --> 05:20.990]  Andrew.
[05:21.470 --> 05:22.690]  Yes, it's clear.
[05:22.770 --> 05:23.770]  Nobody knows where we're going.
[05:23.990 --> 05:25.150]  Why don't you pick where we're going?
[05:25.630 --> 05:27.290]  Yeah, where's F*** Face going to take us?
[05:27.550 --> 05:30.710]  I'm going to pick like the grocery store down the street.
[05:30.810 --> 05:31.590]  We're not going far.
[05:31.650 --> 05:32.630]  We're not even getting past it.
[05:32.630 --> 05:33.410]  I know where we're going.
[05:33.530 --> 05:34.090]  I know where we're going.
[05:34.330 --> 05:36.590]  We're going to the epicenter of the F*** Face universe.
[05:38.210 --> 05:39.850]  Oh, oh, we can see the billboard.
[05:40.070 --> 05:43.810]  Maybe by maybe by 196, we'll go to that that spot.
[05:43.930 --> 05:44.630]  Maybe that'll be the spot.
[05:44.750 --> 05:46.490]  I don't know if that really lines up, but yeah, maybe.
[05:46.910 --> 05:49.750]  I wonder if this is the longest we've talked about Jack shit.
[05:50.750 --> 05:52.050]  No, this whole show.
[05:52.190 --> 05:53.150]  What do you think this show is?
[05:53.150 --> 05:56.010]  I think we got about 109 episodes of that already.
[05:56.310 --> 05:58.010]  Yeah, but this is nothing.
[05:58.430 --> 05:59.470]  Let me ask you guys this.
[06:00.510 --> 06:02.170]  Uh, OK, how about this?
[06:02.170 --> 06:04.790]  All right. I want the four of you
[06:05.550 --> 06:08.250]  to pick a number between one and 20.
[06:08.450 --> 06:09.270]  Gavin, what's your number?
[06:09.990 --> 06:10.630]  It's 17.
[06:11.330 --> 06:12.290]  OK, Andrew?
[06:13.310 --> 06:13.830]  18.
[06:15.090 --> 06:16.130]  Uh, Eric?
[06:16.690 --> 06:17.490]  19. Can you help with the other names?
[06:18.770 --> 06:20.170]  Nick? 13.
[06:20.910 --> 06:22.910]  What the f- we had it all set up.
[06:22.990 --> 06:24.670]  Why would you pick 13?
[06:25.250 --> 06:26.630]  I knew the number.
[06:26.750 --> 06:27.930]  I just had to figure out what.
[06:28.310 --> 06:30.530]  So I guess I'm going to go closest without going over.
[06:31.130 --> 06:32.910]  So the number was 16.
[06:33.010 --> 06:34.910]  So, Gavin, I guess you're closest.
[06:35.310 --> 06:35.630]  Sick.
[06:36.410 --> 06:37.750]  So I went over there.
[06:38.330 --> 06:39.770]  No. Who said 16?
[06:41.110 --> 06:42.110]  Who said 15?
[06:43.390 --> 06:45.030]  I don't think anyone said 15.
[06:45.130 --> 06:46.090]  I thought Nick said 13.
[06:46.370 --> 06:46.710]  What?
[06:47.230 --> 06:51.130]  I thought Gavin said, Gavin said 15 and Andrew said 17.
[06:51.130 --> 06:52.210]  No, Gavin said 17.
[06:52.390 --> 06:53.130]  I said 18.
[06:53.330 --> 06:54.830]  I think Eric said 19.
[06:55.290 --> 06:56.430]  Oh, OK. Well, then never mind.
[06:56.650 --> 06:59.770]  Nick was teed up for 20 and then went to 13.
[06:59.770 --> 07:01.670]  Oh, well, it's Gavin. It's Gavin anyway.
[07:01.730 --> 07:03.010]  Gavin's closest. The number was 16.
[07:03.470 --> 07:05.570]  So it's anyway. Now, Gavin, so you won that.
[07:05.770 --> 07:08.090]  Gavin, I need you to pick a number between 1 and 171.
[07:08.210 --> 07:09.490]  Gavin, congratulations.
[07:11.870 --> 07:13.090]  I'm going somewhere with this.
[07:13.510 --> 07:15.570]  OK, well, I have to pick another number.
[07:16.010 --> 07:17.850]  Just pick a number between 1 and 171.
[07:20.090 --> 07:20.850]  OK, 48.
[07:22.550 --> 07:23.730]  48 picked by Gavin.
[07:23.770 --> 07:24.210]  Good episode.
[07:24.730 --> 07:24.890]  Yeah.
[07:25.510 --> 07:27.310]  All right. We'll discuss that in 184.
[07:27.310 --> 07:28.830]  Do you want to know what?
[07:29.050 --> 07:31.170]  Do you want to know what 48 was about or no?
[07:31.310 --> 07:32.250]  Yeah. Go ahead.
[07:32.710 --> 07:33.790]  How do you know? OK, face.
[07:34.170 --> 07:35.430]  How do you know anything to do with face?
[07:36.030 --> 07:36.430]  Wait, what?
[07:36.530 --> 07:38.870]  Well, because there's not 48 episodes of so all right yet.
[07:39.830 --> 07:40.610]  How do you know?
[07:40.850 --> 07:45.010]  Just because I said between 1 and 171 and there's exactly 171 episodes of this
[07:45.010 --> 07:46.850]  podcast, you assume that's what I'm talking about.
[07:47.170 --> 07:49.430]  OK, so you'll link the numbers to something else.
[07:50.010 --> 07:51.950]  No, it's it's definitely episode 48.
[07:52.010 --> 07:52.530]  What was it about?
[07:54.570 --> 07:56.230]  In the anal trenches.
[07:56.230 --> 07:57.970]  I want out of this car.
[07:58.350 --> 08:00.430]  A tub as narrow as Geoff's foot.
[08:00.870 --> 08:04.290]  Geoff Gavin and Andrew talk about Gavin's ADR.
[08:05.750 --> 08:09.050]  Nick's theory confirmed an official face
[08:09.050 --> 08:12.470]  retraction, getting in a dry tub and missed mechanic.
[08:12.770 --> 08:13.330]  Excellent episode.
[08:14.470 --> 08:16.130]  OK, sounds like a banger.
[08:16.670 --> 08:17.950]  Sounds a lot better than this episode.
[08:20.250 --> 08:24.250]  While we're recapping something, can I can I share a big old
[08:24.250 --> 08:25.830]  face that happened to myself?
[08:25.830 --> 08:28.490]  Oh, hell yes. This week I made a mistake.
[08:29.190 --> 08:31.850]  So as you guys may know, as you might be aware,
[08:32.170 --> 08:36.430]  I am making a real push to win the cock award, as I said last time.
[08:37.010 --> 08:38.270]  It was a whole bit I planned out.
[08:38.850 --> 08:42.210]  And as part of the bit, I made a website.
[08:42.590 --> 08:47.150]  And let me tell you the entire the vision I had for the website that I made.
[08:47.290 --> 08:48.590]  I made this site.
[08:48.910 --> 08:52.930]  And after the presentation, I was going to direct people to it
[08:52.930 --> 08:58.110]  and imply, like, say, like, hey, this if you click this button,
[08:58.610 --> 09:01.150]  it will like you put in your email and you click a button,
[09:01.210 --> 09:06.150]  it will send an email letting somebody know that they should nominate me
[09:06.150 --> 09:09.690]  because the department head, that was the idea. But.
[09:10.730 --> 09:14.350]  But I thought, you know what, this is I love everybody on the merch team.
[09:14.770 --> 09:19.290]  What I was going to do is say that and imply that it was going to the head
[09:19.290 --> 09:22.310]  of merch guy that did the Andrew Halloween thing.
[09:22.310 --> 09:24.370]  But he's great. No issue with him.
[09:24.510 --> 09:25.670]  I was going to apply that,
[09:26.750 --> 09:31.390]  but then have all of the emails go to Jack's work email and have it say,
[09:32.330 --> 09:33.970]  thank you for subscribing to.
[09:34.070 --> 09:34.610]  So all right.
[09:34.630 --> 09:38.310]  Every time they put in their email and so that he would blame you, Geoff.
[09:39.430 --> 09:42.110]  But I couldn't figure out how to make that happen.
[09:42.190 --> 09:45.310]  And I also don't know the merch guy that well.
[09:45.410 --> 09:46.990]  And I have no issue with him.
[09:46.990 --> 09:48.490]  So I felt like it might be too mean.
[09:48.610 --> 09:52.070]  And I just so I dropped the whole website and I didn't do anything with it.
[09:52.070 --> 09:56.590]  I also bought multiple domains because I wasn't sure what to go with.
[09:56.710 --> 10:02.110]  So I bought andrewdeservesacock.com, which was what I built the site off of.
[10:02.730 --> 10:06.790]  Yeah, getandrewacock.com was my other one.
[10:07.010 --> 10:08.870]  And my last one was cock 2023.
[10:10.190 --> 10:12.050]  So I had all these these domains.
[10:12.250 --> 10:12.910]  I built the website.
[10:13.210 --> 10:17.030]  When I set up the website, they had different tiers of the website builder.
[10:17.210 --> 10:21.330]  And I went with the second tier that was like 17 or 18 dollars
[10:21.330 --> 10:22.250]  or something like that a month.
[10:22.870 --> 10:26.570]  And it allowed 500 outgoing emails per month.
[10:26.670 --> 10:29.850]  So I figured at most Jack would get 500 emails.
[10:30.110 --> 10:33.650]  I wanted like as much as I could without it being completely insane.
[10:33.990 --> 10:37.290]  So I set all that up, drop it, don't bring it up at all.
[10:37.570 --> 10:40.850]  And then I get an email saying, hey, you're going to get charged for this
[10:40.850 --> 10:41.870]  in like three days.
[10:41.930 --> 10:45.030]  And I went, oh, fuck, I got to cancel that because I dropped it from my bit.
[10:45.330 --> 10:46.850]  It's not even in the presentation anymore.
[10:46.930 --> 10:48.790]  No one's going to go to this site. It's just going to die.
[10:49.470 --> 10:52.650]  And then I forget about it, as everyone does with every subscription
[10:52.650 --> 10:54.010]  they intend on canceling.
[10:54.550 --> 10:58.150]  And then yesterday I got an email for a receipt for it.
[10:58.210 --> 11:00.650]  And I went, oh, fuck, I paid for it.
[11:00.810 --> 11:04.890]  Shit, I got to I'll just go through this receipt and I'll cancel it.
[11:05.010 --> 11:06.450]  It's like 18 bucks. It sucks.
[11:06.490 --> 11:07.330]  But whatever, I'll live.
[11:07.450 --> 11:12.690]  And I open it and I see that I have been charged two hundred dollars.
[11:12.810 --> 11:17.430]  Well, I, I paid for a one year subscription
[11:17.430 --> 11:21.010]  for AndrewDeservesACock.com to be active,
[11:21.470 --> 11:23.010]  which is not that's way too much.
[11:23.110 --> 11:24.890]  I don't I can't I can't do that.
[11:24.950 --> 11:28.330]  So I immediately have to go to customer support
[11:28.330 --> 11:32.110]  and get a refund for AndrewDeservesACock.com
[11:32.590 --> 11:34.030]  And I'm talking to somebody.
[11:34.190 --> 11:38.990]  I'm having to send them info and trying to get a refund like as your name
[11:38.990 --> 11:43.690]  for a website called YouDeserveACock.com was a time.
[11:43.950 --> 11:45.850]  It was a very embarrassing refund.
[11:45.850 --> 11:49.090]  I had to send them the order number and then they tried to convince me
[11:49.090 --> 11:51.190]  to keep the site because they don't want to give it.
[11:51.290 --> 11:54.930]  They're like, hey, just so you know, this will delete the website immediately
[11:55.330 --> 11:56.550]  if you get rid of it.
[11:56.730 --> 11:57.990]  And I obviously did.
[11:58.170 --> 12:02.050]  But I almost had to pay two hundred dollars for AndrewDeservesACock.com
[12:02.580 --> 12:05.810]  I thankfully was refunded, but it was a nightmare.
[12:05.810 --> 12:08.730]  And then so embarrassing to have to, like, try to talk to someone
[12:08.730 --> 12:10.310]  through a refund process of that.
[12:10.650 --> 12:13.210]  So you were like, it's AndrewDeservesACock.com and they're like, OK,
[12:13.210 --> 12:15.150]  what's your name? And you're like, Andrew.
[12:15.850 --> 12:19.430]  It was like, clearly they have a message press from Andrew
[12:19.430 --> 12:22.590]  and I had to send them the order invoice number so they could pull it up
[12:22.590 --> 12:25.570]  in their system and see the domain and all this stuff.
[12:25.710 --> 12:27.150]  It was just, it was the worst.
[12:27.390 --> 12:31.750]  Without context, it was the worst refund I could possibly imagine.
[12:34.410 --> 12:36.130]  It was a rough, rough start to the week.
[12:37.690 --> 12:39.170]  Thankfully, I got the refund, though.
[12:39.250 --> 12:42.750]  If I'd be, that's too, I don't have that type of cock money thrown around.
[12:43.330 --> 12:44.210]  Two hundred bucks.
[12:46.470 --> 12:51.010]  I think last episode, I was wondering if Starfield was going to be a good game.
[12:51.130 --> 12:52.130]  I hadn't really heard much about it.
[12:52.270 --> 12:54.710]  Oh, I think it's one of my favorite games ever.
[12:54.950 --> 12:56.990]  I don't know. I was I don't know anything about it.
[12:57.010 --> 12:58.030]  How far into it are you now?
[12:58.630 --> 13:00.470]  Oh, I'm like 40 hours in.
[13:00.590 --> 13:02.750]  I'm barely done. 32. Yeah, same.
[13:02.870 --> 13:05.410]  It is such a great game. Such a great game.
[13:05.750 --> 13:08.090]  I let myself dick around in that game so much.
[13:08.090 --> 13:10.830]  If I'm like on a real mission, I've got to do all this important shit.
[13:10.870 --> 13:14.290]  And then I overhear someone talking about like a lost cabbage in the room next door.
[13:14.290 --> 13:16.870]  I just immediately switched what I'm doing or what?
[13:17.950 --> 13:22.870]  I left. I left New Atlantis about five hours into the game, and I just never went back.
[13:23.230 --> 13:27.130]  I just go from planet to planet, picking up missions like a like,
[13:27.270 --> 13:29.430]  like, like, like Carradine in Kung Fu.
[13:29.690 --> 13:32.070]  It's fucking awesome. Such a great game.
[13:32.330 --> 13:34.410]  I'm in a I don't know what to talk about this.
[13:34.950 --> 13:37.270]  OK, are we going to talk about the other thing or no?
[13:37.810 --> 13:38.970]  The fuck is he talking about?
[13:39.550 --> 13:40.930]  He's talking about the new thing.
[13:42.370 --> 13:44.990]  Oh, talk about that, because there's a thing in relation to that.
[13:45.270 --> 13:49.110]  But I can't I can't talk about that unless you talk about the other thing.
[13:49.790 --> 13:50.970]  Are we talking about that?
[13:51.490 --> 13:53.370]  This is why we shouldn't have just started immediately.
[13:53.370 --> 13:55.490]  I thought we're going to have a conference because we're going back and forth.
[13:55.590 --> 13:56.370]  I don't know what we're doing.
[13:56.690 --> 13:58.450]  I don't think that one has anything to do with the other.
[13:58.530 --> 14:02.370]  I think I just want to know, well, you know, I like I know you there.
[14:02.690 --> 14:06.270]  It's did. Oh, Eric asked if I save file got fixed.
[14:06.330 --> 14:07.890]  No, well, sort of.
[14:07.950 --> 14:10.770]  The game sort of fixed itself over time, but it was broken.
[14:10.930 --> 14:12.890]  It was broken for about six hours.
[14:13.450 --> 14:14.610]  How is it broken?
[14:14.750 --> 14:17.650]  I lost. The game wouldn't give me quest markers anymore.
[14:18.090 --> 14:20.690]  Oh, so like, oh, so, you know, it's a Bethesda game.
[14:20.830 --> 14:24.430]  So you're and you're on like you're in like Neon City and you take an elevator
[14:24.430 --> 14:27.330]  to like the fifth floor and you talk to a guy named Trevor
[14:27.750 --> 14:30.250]  and then he tells you to go to another planet.
[14:30.370 --> 14:32.550]  And so you have to like write it down because there's no quest marker
[14:32.550 --> 14:33.990]  and then find it on the fucking star map.
[14:34.110 --> 14:37.910]  And then you got to remember, like, what city did Trevor live in on what planet?
[14:37.910 --> 14:40.950]  What floor on the fucking like what office number?
[14:41.230 --> 14:44.250]  It was really it slowed me down for quite a bit, but I recovered.
[14:44.550 --> 14:47.210]  Did you reset like how did it did it just fix itself?
[14:47.370 --> 14:48.250]  How did that get fixed?
[14:48.950 --> 14:54.350]  It eventually kind of I just I think that the the bug was tied to.
[14:55.650 --> 14:59.810]  The bug happened when I was completing a like a final mission in a quest line,
[14:59.930 --> 15:02.710]  which was real bum bummer, and then it wouldn't let me complete that mission.
[15:02.870 --> 15:06.510]  And then I just eventually did every other quest in my inventory.
[15:06.510 --> 15:08.830]  And there must have been another one in there glitched.
[15:08.870 --> 15:10.950]  And when I did that, it all just kind of started working again.
[15:11.030 --> 15:11.950]  But it doesn't work great.
[15:12.290 --> 15:14.850]  I briefly lost the ability to fire my gun.
[15:15.030 --> 15:17.790]  It just my guns would wiggle when I pulled the trigger, but they wouldn't shoot.
[15:18.150 --> 15:20.630]  And then to fix it, I became a woman.
[15:22.430 --> 15:24.230]  What do you mean they would wiggle?
[15:24.770 --> 15:26.250]  They would sort of wiggle.
[15:26.410 --> 15:29.850]  It would be like a little like a little wiggle of the the end of the gun.
[15:30.410 --> 15:31.210]  Wouldn't shoot anything.
[15:31.690 --> 15:33.070]  And then I went to New Atlantis.
[15:33.150 --> 15:35.970]  I walked into Enhance, changed my appearance, became a woman.
[15:36.350 --> 15:37.910]  Walked back out. Guns work.
[15:38.290 --> 15:39.030]  So are you still a woman?
[15:39.530 --> 15:42.090]  I stayed a woman for a little bit, and then eventually I went back to my.
[15:42.210 --> 15:44.370]  The thing is, I had to remake my original guy,
[15:44.450 --> 15:45.830]  which I couldn't be bothered to do at the time.
[15:46.110 --> 15:47.510]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[15:48.030 --> 15:49.990]  Did you? Well, wait, what did you when you flipped?
[15:50.850 --> 15:55.470]  Did you did you do it with the intent of trying to solve that problem?
[15:55.710 --> 15:55.970]  Or did you?
[15:56.350 --> 15:59.190]  Yeah, it was something that someone suggested on Google or Reddit or something.
[15:59.350 --> 16:00.010]  God, I did.
[16:00.110 --> 16:05.010]  I just strolled in as a bloke and walked out as a woman firing wildly into the air.
[16:05.010 --> 16:06.210]  That is really funny.
[16:06.590 --> 16:10.450]  That's the thing with these games is like if anyone has a bug and then they fix it,
[16:10.510 --> 16:13.330]  I want to know how, because I just assume I'm going to encounter it eventually.
[16:13.870 --> 16:16.310]  That. Yeah, it's my quest.
[16:16.390 --> 16:19.150]  I've still fucked up, but at least I can find missions and stuff now, which helps.
[16:19.230 --> 16:22.370]  But that that bug you're describing, Gavin, a lot of people
[16:22.910 --> 16:26.430]  mentioned that they had in that in that early week where it wasn't fully released.
[16:26.470 --> 16:29.130]  It was just released for the for people that bought the special edition or whatever.
[16:30.010 --> 16:33.370]  And I was reading that a lot of people were trying to revert to old saves,
[16:33.370 --> 16:37.470]  but that the bug follows you into old saves and it would corrupt old saves.
[16:38.030 --> 16:40.450]  No. Yeah, it goes back in time.
[16:41.690 --> 16:42.770]  That's a nightmare.
[16:43.390 --> 16:45.450]  Yeah, but apparently all you got to do is just go to
[16:46.190 --> 16:48.590]  enhance and switch some stuff up and then you're good to go.
[16:49.030 --> 16:50.050]  My recommendation for that game.
[16:50.170 --> 16:51.870]  Don't rely on the quick saves or the auto saves.
[16:52.250 --> 16:54.650]  Make shitloads of actual full blown saves.
[16:55.130 --> 16:58.810]  Yes. I learned my lesson with I think it was New Vegas.
[16:59.370 --> 17:03.210]  I died while switching, like going into a vault.
[17:03.210 --> 17:05.330]  And so but it didn't register.
[17:05.530 --> 17:07.830]  I died until like I hit the button.
[17:07.970 --> 17:11.870]  So my quick save, which was on the other side of the door, was immediate death.
[17:11.910 --> 17:13.690]  And I was in a death loop nonstop.
[17:13.790 --> 17:16.470]  And I was probably like 10 hours into the game at that point.
[17:16.570 --> 17:17.990]  And I lost all of my progress.
[17:18.130 --> 17:19.030]  I didn't manual save.
[17:19.190 --> 17:20.690]  So now I'm manually saving everywhere.
[17:20.810 --> 17:22.070]  Everything I do manual. Yeah.
[17:22.610 --> 17:27.510]  I did a dumb thing early on in Starfield where
[17:28.650 --> 17:32.090]  it's like when you're piloting your ship on the left,
[17:32.090 --> 17:34.110]  you have very much like Star Trek.
[17:34.210 --> 17:39.050]  You have like columns, one for missiles, a column for
[17:39.650 --> 17:42.850]  like engine strength or speed, a column for like your shields
[17:42.850 --> 17:43.990]  and then one for your grav lift.
[17:44.110 --> 17:46.530]  And you can raise and lower them so you can like divert power,
[17:46.690 --> 17:50.330]  kind of like Scotty does to, you know, like diverting power to shields.
[17:50.430 --> 17:51.750]  Like you literally do that in the game.
[17:52.170 --> 17:56.030]  And I I warped into a planetary orbit
[17:56.030 --> 17:59.750]  where there was a fight going on and I could not win it.
[17:59.770 --> 18:01.090]  Like I had to start a ship.
[18:01.090 --> 18:04.090]  I hadn't paid any attention to upgrading my ship at that point.
[18:04.210 --> 18:06.830]  And they just like I tried to win the fight like ten times
[18:06.830 --> 18:10.190]  and it became clear to me that there was no way I was going to win.
[18:10.610 --> 18:14.730]  And similarly, though, like the save file starts
[18:14.730 --> 18:17.310]  with me launching into that location.
[18:17.510 --> 18:20.710]  And so I just turned around and just flew the other way.
[18:20.750 --> 18:22.270]  And then every once in a while, you can hit boost
[18:22.270 --> 18:23.870]  and you can very slowly go the other way.
[18:23.970 --> 18:26.010]  And I kept trying to grav jump and it wouldn't let me.
[18:26.090 --> 18:26.610]  It wouldn't let me.
[18:26.610 --> 18:33.490]  And I I just sailed the other way in space for twenty two minutes
[18:34.290 --> 18:37.350]  before I realized that I had with the other guys behind me.
[18:37.430 --> 18:38.050]  They were at this point.
[18:38.110 --> 18:41.490]  They were like eleven thousand kilometers behind me, but still following me.
[18:41.570 --> 18:43.810]  And I'm like, what is the threat distance on this thing?
[18:43.870 --> 18:45.710]  You know, when do they leave me the fuck alone?
[18:46.450 --> 18:49.830]  Figuring that like once I wasn't in combat, it would allow me to grav jump again.
[18:49.890 --> 18:51.810]  I just assumed that it was like a mechanic in the game
[18:51.810 --> 18:55.210]  because it hadn't happened to me yet where I needed to escape from a fight.
[18:55.970 --> 18:59.950]  And and at twenty two minutes is when I looked at the the little columns
[18:59.950 --> 19:03.630]  and realized I had taken all of the grav lift away and put it in shields
[19:03.630 --> 19:06.930]  and that I could have just I just switch that back.
[19:06.990 --> 19:09.010]  And then I grav jumped out of there immediately.
[19:09.230 --> 19:11.930]  And I had just spent twenty two fucking minutes just hitting
[19:12.430 --> 19:13.830]  hitting up on the left stick.
[19:14.570 --> 19:15.870]  What? Why? Why?
[19:18.110 --> 19:20.050]  Have you done much planet scanning?
[19:21.670 --> 19:24.470]  Yeah, but you do it on the surface like you don't do it.
[19:24.470 --> 19:27.370]  You both like, uh, I guess. Yeah, I guess you do.
[19:27.410 --> 19:28.910]  I've done I've done surface scanning.
[19:29.710 --> 19:32.570]  So for me, like I've been focusing purely on scanning.
[19:32.690 --> 19:34.650]  So I do the planetary scan, which I've leveled up.
[19:34.710 --> 19:38.090]  It shows me where all the materials are so I can land in an area where they're at.
[19:38.190 --> 19:39.310]  And then I can scan them quickly.
[19:39.970 --> 19:44.710]  I've spent two hours trying to find one species of alien on a planet
[19:44.710 --> 19:46.450]  just running around. I couldn't find it.
[19:46.890 --> 19:49.510]  I've just been trying to clear every planet I land on, essentially,
[19:49.670 --> 19:50.450]  with all the in the sea.
[19:51.150 --> 19:52.350]  They were in the sea.
[19:52.350 --> 19:56.290]  There's some fucking sharks and fish and shit that I did not encounter.
[19:56.410 --> 19:59.250]  I hadn't seen them yet, but it was just this funny thing where like,
[19:59.350 --> 20:00.350]  that's how I spent my night.
[20:00.730 --> 20:02.990]  I was like, I tried for 30 minutes, couldn't find anything.
[20:03.290 --> 20:07.090]  I just had to be like, I am dedicating my evening to discovering
[20:07.090 --> 20:09.830]  this fucking species of alien that I know is here
[20:09.830 --> 20:12.290]  because it tells you if you're in the wrong biome or not.
[20:12.490 --> 20:15.530]  It is in this biome, but I don't know where it is.
[20:15.670 --> 20:17.110]  And the fucking little grubs.
[20:17.510 --> 20:22.070]  I don't know if you've seen like those stupid little worms that float around.
[20:22.610 --> 20:24.810]  In that game where they crawl, they crawl everywhere.
[20:25.010 --> 20:26.110]  They're always blue.
[20:26.670 --> 20:30.570]  So like after I'd say the probably the the 90 ish minute mark,
[20:30.690 --> 20:34.950]  I found one of those randomly on a hill and I got so excited.
[20:35.070 --> 20:37.070]  It was like, that's why I haven't been able to find this.
[20:37.190 --> 20:39.470]  It's just a tiny, tiny little grub.
[20:39.610 --> 20:41.550]  And it was useless. It had nothing to do with anything.
[20:42.010 --> 20:42.670]  It's terrible.
[20:43.170 --> 20:47.470]  I bought a house last night, my first house in Aquila City,
[20:47.990 --> 20:51.230]  which I don't know if you've been there, but it's like a big sprawling kind of city.
[20:51.230 --> 20:52.770]  You know how a lot of the cities stack?
[20:52.950 --> 20:55.410]  Like there's a like there's a sub level and then like a sub sub level.
[20:55.610 --> 20:59.210]  But Aquila City, it's just all sprawl, like urban sprawl like Houston.
[21:01.130 --> 21:04.070]  And I they offered me the opportunity to buy a house.
[21:04.090 --> 21:05.030]  And I thought, yeah, fuck it.
[21:05.070 --> 21:07.490]  I don't really like Aquila City, but I'll buy a house here just to see what's up.
[21:08.030 --> 21:10.310]  And I bought a house and I spent like a half an hour
[21:11.230 --> 21:14.150]  decorating it and moving stuff around and figuring out
[21:14.150 --> 21:15.530]  where to put my snow globes and shit.
[21:15.610 --> 21:17.870]  And then I went outside and I ran and I did a mission.
[21:18.330 --> 21:22.030]  And then I turned around to go back home and realized I had no idea
[21:22.030 --> 21:22.990]  where I bought that house.
[21:23.110 --> 21:25.830]  And I don't know if it's because my quest marker is fucked up
[21:25.830 --> 21:28.810]  or if it's just the way the game works, but I could.
[21:28.890 --> 21:31.190]  There was nothing pointing me to my house.
[21:31.390 --> 21:34.610]  And it took me about 30 minutes of running around
[21:34.610 --> 21:37.050]  Aquila City, checking doors until I found out where I lived.
[21:37.690 --> 21:39.470]  Just straight going. No, that's not it.
[21:39.650 --> 21:41.110]  No, that's not it. God damn it.
[21:41.310 --> 21:42.130]  No, that's not it.
[21:42.250 --> 21:44.370]  That doesn't look familiar. God damn it.
[21:44.730 --> 21:47.690]  And now I think the first time I played Skyrim, I had the similar thing
[21:47.690 --> 21:51.370]  when I eventually bought the house in Whiterun, because I expected to say
[21:51.370 --> 21:54.850]  like my house or my home or something, but it just says like Bree's home or something.
[21:54.990 --> 21:56.310]  So I was running around looking at all the doors.
[21:56.410 --> 21:57.710]  I was like, Bree's home, that's not it.
[21:57.810 --> 21:59.190]  And I just couldn't find it for ages.
[22:00.670 --> 22:03.730]  It's like they expect you to really know where you live. Yeah.
[22:05.810 --> 22:07.830]  I... they're all like traits and stuff you can have.
[22:07.950 --> 22:09.690]  I went with you start with a house.
[22:09.730 --> 22:13.010]  So I started the game $125,000 in debt,
[22:13.390 --> 22:17.050]  assuming that was the only way to own a home in the game.
[22:17.050 --> 22:18.730]  That was a false assumption.
[22:18.930 --> 22:23.470]  I have a massive regret and starting in the whole $125,000 credits.
[22:23.570 --> 22:25.850]  Yeah, especially because I bought my house for $45,000.
[22:27.230 --> 22:28.330]  What? $45,000?
[22:28.830 --> 22:31.110]  Yeah, that's how much the house on Akila City cost. $45,000.
[22:31.750 --> 22:34.770]  Oh, my God. I'm never even going to use the house.
[22:34.850 --> 22:35.530]  It's just empty.
[22:35.670 --> 22:37.470]  It's for people that like customizing things.
[22:37.630 --> 22:38.750]  That's not how I play.
[22:39.090 --> 22:40.250]  I just thought it was the only way to get a house.
[22:40.550 --> 22:42.670]  God damn it. That sucks.
[22:43.130 --> 22:44.730]  I have I have parents.
[22:48.470 --> 22:49.450]  Gavin is wonderful.
[22:52.490 --> 22:54.530]  You chose the parents perk.
[22:54.730 --> 22:55.830]  He fucking loser.
[22:56.090 --> 22:57.390]  You didn't pick parents?
[22:58.430 --> 22:59.210]  I picked parents.
[22:59.490 --> 23:02.370]  A lot of the time I'll be like on important missions and I'll be like talking
[23:02.370 --> 23:06.070]  to all my constellation friends and then my parents will just be there.
[23:06.350 --> 23:08.030]  They'll be like, oh, hi, how are you doing?
[23:08.210 --> 23:09.130]  How are you doing at work?
[23:09.310 --> 23:12.050]  And I'm like, I'm like, you're embarrassing me.
[23:13.770 --> 23:15.010]  You're mocking him, Geoff.
[23:16.290 --> 23:18.710]  You have no idea what those parents will do for you.
[23:18.770 --> 23:20.690]  OK, there's your dad.
[23:21.570 --> 23:23.370]  He's deep in the poker world.
[23:23.550 --> 23:25.290]  OK, do you have parents, too?
[23:25.930 --> 23:27.230]  Of course. Of course.
[23:27.270 --> 23:28.170]  I went with parents.
[23:28.990 --> 23:30.790]  Oh, my. You go with parents.
[23:31.590 --> 23:33.290]  I got plenty in the real world.
[23:33.330 --> 23:34.310]  I don't need fake parents.
[23:35.190 --> 23:36.530]  Yeah, but I want a good one.
[23:36.610 --> 23:38.090]  So it's it's this is my.
[23:38.770 --> 23:41.670]  Oh, this game's a real fantasy for you.
[23:42.270 --> 23:43.070]  Oh, man.
[23:44.690 --> 23:46.590]  Have you ever seen a little bit of my world?
[23:47.250 --> 23:49.230]  I have. I've seen his character.
[23:49.410 --> 23:51.330]  I've seen the name. Great name.
[23:51.550 --> 23:52.110]  What is your name?
[23:53.630 --> 23:54.710]  Dark Bastard II.
[23:56.150 --> 23:59.450]  Because in Skyrim, I played a dark elf and I just called him Dark Bastard.
[23:59.950 --> 24:01.250]  And I just feel like they're related.
[24:01.850 --> 24:02.890]  Andrew, what's your guy's name?
[24:03.790 --> 24:05.990]  I think it's just Andrew. I don't have a funny name.
[24:07.810 --> 24:09.390]  I should have went Johnny Caviar.
[24:09.590 --> 24:10.390]  That would have been the better.
[24:10.390 --> 24:13.270]  Oh, that's a great name.
[24:13.610 --> 24:14.270]  What about you, Geoff?
[24:14.390 --> 24:16.310]  I made the oldest character I could make
[24:17.570 --> 24:20.910]  and like liver spot, shock, white hair, big, bushy mustache.
[24:21.190 --> 24:23.270]  And I named him Lil Geoffy.
[24:25.150 --> 24:28.130]  I adventure around the universe as Lil Geoffy.
[24:28.290 --> 24:33.690]  So your Starfield characters are Dark Bastard II, Lil Geoffy and Andrew?
[24:35.310 --> 24:36.870]  That's true. Yeah.
[24:36.990 --> 24:39.790]  Yep. Did you see the list of names
[24:39.790 --> 24:41.450]  that the robot I got?
[24:41.690 --> 24:43.850]  I got a lot of messages about the fact that your robot,
[24:43.990 --> 24:48.270]  you get called Captain whatever by the robot you have on your crew.
[24:48.370 --> 24:49.690]  It's like the first crew member you get.
[24:49.810 --> 24:53.350]  And one of the available options is F*** Face, Captain F*** Face.
[24:53.590 --> 24:54.230]  Are you serious?
[24:54.650 --> 24:55.830]  Yeah, it says it within the game.
[24:56.090 --> 24:57.110]  Oh, I had no idea.
[24:57.750 --> 25:00.670]  So if you name your character F*** Face, it will call you Captain F*** Face.
[25:00.910 --> 25:03.970]  There's also apples in the game that are called Cosmic Apples.
[25:04.450 --> 25:06.170]  I saw that. Yeah. Yeah.
[25:06.230 --> 25:08.190]  I wonder if I wonder if it has to be one word, though.
[25:08.190 --> 25:09.870]  Otherwise, he'd probably call you Captain Face.
[25:10.370 --> 25:12.050]  Yeah, there'd be a bleep. Otherwise.
[25:13.670 --> 25:16.170]  I think that it's a holdover thing from like
[25:17.230 --> 25:18.550]  the last Fallout game.
[25:18.810 --> 25:20.270]  Not 76, the one before it, 4.
[25:20.770 --> 25:23.410]  I think I think that was a name that you could use also.
[25:24.110 --> 25:25.850]  So that's like a little thing.
[25:26.130 --> 25:26.790]  What was that bloke?
[25:27.030 --> 25:28.590]  What's the robot you have at the beginning of Fallout 4?
[25:28.670 --> 25:31.370]  Jeebs, Jops, Jumps, Otis.
[25:31.730 --> 25:32.770]  Jeebs? What's his name?
[25:34.270 --> 25:36.350]  Oh, I thought he had like a real human name.
[25:36.350 --> 25:39.390]  But yeah, he calls you by the name you type in if it's on the list.
[25:40.950 --> 25:42.970]  It's my favorite Bethesda game, I think.
[25:43.210 --> 25:46.750]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm engaged in the world and in a way that I haven't been.
[25:47.030 --> 25:49.690]  And I was thinking about because I love Fallout 3 and the Fallout games.
[25:49.750 --> 25:50.930]  I never really played Skyrim.
[25:51.470 --> 25:55.650]  I think what I like so much more about Starfield is even though Fallout is like
[25:55.650 --> 25:57.590]  Codsworth. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Nick. Codsworth.
[25:58.310 --> 25:59.050]  Great call.
[26:00.310 --> 26:03.090]  Even though like Fallout is such an extreme version of Earth,
[26:03.190 --> 26:05.750]  it's like you're dealing with someone without flesh.
[26:05.750 --> 26:11.190]  Like it's still grounded in our reality as opposed to Starfield and in space.
[26:11.250 --> 26:15.690]  It feels like so much more is possible and I can encounter anything
[26:15.690 --> 26:17.170]  essentially on any mission.
[26:17.270 --> 26:22.290]  It's just so much more mystery and intrigue in my exploration of those worlds.
[26:22.550 --> 26:25.090]  I jumped into a new system and I got contacted by a ship
[26:25.090 --> 26:27.790]  that was nearby asking about my extended warranty.
[26:28.530 --> 26:31.690]  Yeah, so did I. Did you pay for a warranty thing?
[26:32.030 --> 26:33.730]  I didn't have enough cash at the time.
[26:33.730 --> 26:37.330]  I wanted to get the ultra executive premium plan or whatever for 200,000.
[26:37.730 --> 26:40.210]  Yeah. So he only offers you up to what you have.
[26:40.230 --> 26:43.110]  And I have one hundred thirty five thousand credits.
[26:43.330 --> 26:45.970]  I haven't paid off my mortgage yet, but I'm about to do it.
[26:46.190 --> 26:49.790]  And then I encountered him and he offered me a hundred thousand dollars
[26:49.790 --> 26:52.770]  ship insurance, which I wanted just to see what would happen.
[26:53.010 --> 26:55.390]  But then it would completely reset my mortgage process.
[26:56.170 --> 26:57.710]  So I didn't take it.
[26:57.970 --> 26:58.810]  He just flew away.
[26:59.070 --> 27:01.370]  But I want to get the top tier one as well.
[27:01.370 --> 27:05.110]  I had a moment today where I when I was playing at lunch, right.
[27:05.350 --> 27:09.150]  I was following up one of the main missions, you know, to find the artifacts.
[27:09.370 --> 27:11.070]  And I went to the eye for the first time.
[27:11.130 --> 27:12.790]  Have you ever been to that place? Yeah.
[27:13.590 --> 27:16.610]  And they have those tubes that you can walk around on the left
[27:16.610 --> 27:18.830]  and the right that are fully glass.
[27:19.050 --> 27:22.050]  And there's like a pile of trash at the end of each one.
[27:22.150 --> 27:25.190]  Yeah. And like a note on the one on the right you should pick up.
[27:25.510 --> 27:28.850]  But but you walk in and it's kind of like it's kind of like
[27:28.850 --> 27:30.990]  when you go through those enclosures at the aquarium
[27:30.990 --> 27:34.310]  where there's where you're walking in like a tube and there's sharks
[27:34.310 --> 27:36.630]  swimming all around you and you feel like super immersed.
[27:37.050 --> 27:39.190]  And I was just I just stopped and I was looking out at space.
[27:39.310 --> 27:43.390]  And as I was doing it, a ship came by and then it warped away.
[27:43.390 --> 27:44.710]  And then another ship came by.
[27:44.770 --> 27:48.290]  And I after like three minutes, I realized I was just standing there,
[27:48.350 --> 27:51.310]  just like watching ships go in and out of orbit around me.
[27:51.310 --> 27:53.550]  And I was just I forgot that I was playing the game.
[27:53.570 --> 27:56.710]  I was just in like just sucked into the fucking universe.
[27:56.730 --> 27:59.610]  They do such a great job of making the world feel alive.
[27:59.610 --> 28:02.470]  Yeah. And it's this is such a subtle touch.
[28:02.650 --> 28:06.830]  Like cyberpunk kind of looks the same, but it just feels so
[28:06.830 --> 28:09.870]  the NPCs will just feel like such empty headed drones.
[28:10.710 --> 28:12.670]  In comparison to Starfield.
[28:14.050 --> 28:17.350]  It's great. Yeah, it's a really, really, really great video game.
[28:22.810 --> 28:25.810]  Cold turkey may be great on sandwiches, but there's a better way
[28:25.810 --> 28:26.950]  to break your bad habits.
[28:27.090 --> 28:30.510]  And we're not talking about some weird mind voodoo from your crazy neighbor,
[28:30.750 --> 28:31.970]  which I've had a lot of.
[28:31.970 --> 28:35.430]  I've never had a mind voodoo crazy neighbor, but I've had neighbors
[28:35.430 --> 28:37.330]  that would destroy walls.
[28:37.470 --> 28:38.810]  I've had neighbors that
[28:40.390 --> 28:43.310]  had affairs and like very public ways.
[28:44.050 --> 28:45.610]  Weird garden vibe neighbor.
[28:45.750 --> 28:48.050]  I've had all sorts of weird neighbors, all from one house.
[28:48.130 --> 28:50.490]  Weirdly enough, was like a weird house magnet for people.
[28:50.770 --> 28:52.390]  But anyway, that's not important.
[28:52.650 --> 28:56.330]  What is important is us talking about our sponsor fume
[28:56.330 --> 28:58.890]  and how they look at the problem in a different way.
[28:58.950 --> 29:00.770]  Not everything in a bad habit is wrong.
[29:00.770 --> 29:03.150]  So instead of drastic, uncomfortable change,
[29:03.450 --> 29:05.370]  why not just remove the bad from your habit?
[29:06.090 --> 29:09.330]  Fume is an innovative award nominated device that does just that.
[29:09.770 --> 29:12.350]  Instead of electronics, fume is completely natural.
[29:12.890 --> 29:15.270]  Instead of vapor, fume uses flavored air.
[29:15.870 --> 29:19.470]  And instead of harmful chemicals, fume uses all natural, delicious flavors.
[29:20.170 --> 29:22.910]  You get it. Instead of bad, fume is good.
[29:23.170 --> 29:27.090]  It's a habit you're free to enjoy and makes replacing your bad habit easy.
[29:27.710 --> 29:29.790]  Your fume comes with an adjustable airflow dial
[29:29.790 --> 29:32.910]  and is designed with movable parts and magnets for fidgeting,
[29:33.250 --> 29:36.390]  giving your fingers a lot to do, which is helpful for de-stressing
[29:36.390 --> 29:38.970]  and anxiety while breaking your habit.
[29:39.450 --> 29:41.370]  Another thing about fume is how cool it looks.
[29:41.450 --> 29:43.870]  It's beautiful real wood and the shape is awesome.
[29:44.330 --> 29:46.570]  It is something that you would feel really cool using.
[29:48.070 --> 29:50.410]  Stopping is something we all put off because it's hard,
[29:50.490 --> 29:53.510]  but switching to fume is easy, enjoyable and even fun.
[29:53.970 --> 29:58.490]  It has served over 100,000 customers and has thousands of success stories.

[30:19.150 --> 30:21.370]  The best way to learn a language is through immersion,
[30:21.570 --> 30:24.490]  living with the language is spoken natively and using it every day.
[30:24.850 --> 30:26.310]  But that's not possible for everyone.
[30:26.310 --> 30:28.410]  So what's the second best way to learn a language?
[30:28.950 --> 30:32.030]  Babbel, because of Babbel, you can start speaking a new language
[30:32.030 --> 30:33.390]  in just three weeks.
[30:33.870 --> 30:36.730]  This summer, you can start speaking a new language with Babbel.
[30:37.250 --> 30:39.430]  Why Babbel? Because it works.
[30:39.790 --> 30:42.090]  Instead of paying hundreds of dollars for a private tutor
[30:42.090 --> 30:45.130]  or fooling yourself with language apps that are a little more than games,
[30:45.670 --> 30:49.950]  Babbel's quick 10 minute lessons are designed by over 150 language experts
[30:49.950 --> 30:54.070]  to help you start speaking a new language in as little as three weeks.
[30:54.670 --> 30:57.370]  Babbel is designed by real people for real conversations.
[30:57.990 --> 31:01.150]  All of Babbel's tips and tools for learning a new language are approachable,
[31:01.570 --> 31:03.970]  accessible, rooted in real life situations
[31:04.430 --> 31:06.650]  and delivered with conversation based teaching.
[31:07.090 --> 31:10.090]  Babbel has so many convenient courses that help you learn real life
[31:10.090 --> 31:13.910]  conversation skills, making it easy to pick up on how to order food,
[31:14.070 --> 31:17.490]  ask for directions, speak to merchants without having to consult language apps
[31:17.490 --> 31:21.510]  while on vacation, which is something you never want to do.
[31:21.510 --> 31:22.890]  It just takes you out of the experience.
[31:23.110 --> 31:24.410]  So use Babbel instead.
[31:25.050 --> 31:27.150]  Plus, with Babbel speech recognition technology,
[31:27.410 --> 31:30.510]  it helps you to improve your pronunciation and accent,
[31:30.870 --> 31:33.170]  which is so important to me, in my opinion.
[31:33.330 --> 31:34.850]  If you don't know how to pronounce a word correctly,
[31:35.230 --> 31:37.050]  it's almost like not knowing it at all.
[31:37.990 --> 31:40.390]  Studies from Yale, Michigan State University
[31:40.390 --> 31:43.470]  and others continue to prove that Babbel is better.
[31:44.070 --> 31:47.710]  For instance, one study found that using Babbel for 15 hours
[31:47.710 --> 31:50.190]  is equivalent to a full semester at college.
[31:50.550 --> 31:52.570]  With over 10 million subscriptions sold,
[31:53.130 --> 31:56.030]  Babbel is real language learning for real conversations.

[34:12.470 --> 34:14.910]  Oh, man. Hey, I got a question for y'all.
[34:15.330 --> 34:17.870]  Um, yeah, I was listening to Howard Stern the other day
[34:17.870 --> 34:20.490]  and they were playing some some I don't know if you guys know this,
[34:20.590 --> 34:23.870]  but a lot of Howard Stern fans, they'll yell bababooey at sporting events
[34:23.870 --> 34:28.970]  like in golf or in tennis to try to get heard or in baseball or whatever.
[34:29.430 --> 34:30.550]  And I got to thinking.
[34:30.790 --> 34:33.270]  Now, I'm not saying that anybody like regulation listeners
[34:33.270 --> 34:34.990]  or comment leavers should ever do this.
[34:35.710 --> 34:37.470]  I'm not insinuating that at all. I really am not.
[34:37.510 --> 34:40.350]  But I was wondering, like if we had something like that, what would it be?
[34:41.030 --> 34:42.330]  What would our bababooey like?
[34:42.330 --> 34:44.910]  What would be the face bababooey? Would it be eat the pencil?
[34:46.070 --> 34:47.810]  Yeah, or Eric's email address.
[34:48.810 --> 34:50.510]  Eric's email address is a good one.
[34:50.730 --> 34:55.350]  Just email Geoff's boss at eric.com or whatever the fuck that email was.
[34:55.570 --> 34:56.650]  There you go, Geoff's boss.
[34:57.870 --> 35:00.950]  Yeah, eat the pencil, I think is perfect because that's
[35:00.950 --> 35:02.950]  that's got the deepest lore in the podcast, I think.
[35:03.190 --> 35:05.390]  I like that. I was also thinking somebody screaming
[35:05.390 --> 35:07.330]  you got caviar would be pretty funny
[35:08.790 --> 35:10.830]  or just Johnny Caviar in general.
[35:10.830 --> 35:11.490]  But yeah, I agree.
[35:11.610 --> 35:12.830]  Eat the pencil seems to make the most sense.
[35:12.910 --> 35:13.670]  But I don't know.
[35:13.690 --> 35:16.790]  I never I just I just hadn't thought of.
[35:17.630 --> 35:19.670]  I don't know what our version of that would be.
[35:20.310 --> 35:24.790]  The same legs are like length of history, but imagining a crowd
[35:24.790 --> 35:29.770]  yelling ham fan at somebody who has no idea what it means is really funny to me.
[35:31.590 --> 35:33.170]  I barely remember what that means.
[35:34.210 --> 35:35.530]  It was a license plate somewhere.
[35:35.690 --> 35:38.590]  Yeah, Geoff loved the license plate.
[35:38.590 --> 35:40.170]  Ham fan. He had a ham fan plate.
[35:42.310 --> 35:45.230]  I just like imagine someone getting ready to take a shot in golf
[35:45.230 --> 35:49.330]  and then the entire crowd just starts chanting ham fan, ham fan,
[35:49.430 --> 35:52.010]  and they have no idea why it sounds so funny.
[35:52.050 --> 35:53.570]  Sounds like such an insult.
[35:54.290 --> 35:55.090]  It does.
[35:56.950 --> 35:57.950]  You ham fan.
[36:00.970 --> 36:03.150]  I gave you guys some homework.
[36:03.270 --> 36:04.070]  I don't know if you've done it.
[36:04.090 --> 36:05.370]  I'm not sure if you want to touch on that yet.
[36:06.070 --> 36:06.850]  Oh, what are your thoughts?
[36:07.650 --> 36:09.270]  Geoff was stressed about it.
[36:09.410 --> 36:11.350]  Oh, man. Well, you took the easy one.
[36:11.670 --> 36:13.170]  Oh, I took the easy one.
[36:13.310 --> 36:15.170]  Yeah. Can we talk about that?
[36:15.230 --> 36:19.030]  Gavin had this idea and then flew to a different country
[36:19.030 --> 36:23.530]  and he could have given us a week to prep, but instead decided to give us an hour.
[36:24.030 --> 36:27.570]  The only the only reason we even did it is because I overheard it
[36:27.570 --> 36:30.330]  when Emily was listening to the episode and I thought Gavin never gave us
[36:30.330 --> 36:34.090]  the stupid prompts and I asked about it and then I immediately regretted
[36:34.090 --> 36:34.830]  asking about it.
[36:34.830 --> 36:37.950]  So this was based on my game as a kid called punch lining,
[36:38.110 --> 36:41.330]  where I would just say the ends of jokes that weren't real in front of people.
[36:41.330 --> 36:44.330]  We were walking past and all my friends would laugh and make it seem like
[36:44.330 --> 36:46.630]  I was really funny to strangers, even though there was no real joke.
[36:47.250 --> 36:50.550]  And apparently I was going to come up with some punch lines
[36:50.550 --> 36:54.150]  and you guys had to make the jokes, figure out what the joke was.
[36:54.910 --> 36:56.310]  So I've given you the homework.
[36:56.670 --> 36:59.030]  But I also preface this by saying I don't know.
[37:00.310 --> 37:03.830]  Well, I was looking at these prompts having absolutely no idea what I would do.
[37:03.830 --> 37:05.850]  I don't know how you get anything usable out of these.
[37:06.330 --> 37:09.550]  Well, I also would challenge based off these punch lines
[37:09.550 --> 37:11.970]  that anyone thought you were funny as they walk by.
[37:12.130 --> 37:15.370]  I don't think that that would be the assessment they would have
[37:15.370 --> 37:17.170]  hearing what these punch lines are.
[37:17.230 --> 37:18.490]  Well, I was I was like 13.
[37:18.630 --> 37:22.570]  So, you know, we all thought we were very funny, but I assume no one was even paying attention.
[37:23.170 --> 37:27.070]  But I don't think anyone who passed you walked by thought, wow, that guy's funny.
[37:27.390 --> 37:29.210]  That was nailing it.
[37:29.390 --> 37:30.990]  I bet one person did.
[37:31.510 --> 37:32.790]  I bet it worked on one person.
[37:33.310 --> 37:35.170]  I would like to know who they are.
[37:35.570 --> 37:37.430]  Who's the one person that was deceived?
[37:37.930 --> 37:39.350]  They're probably not still alive.
[37:39.670 --> 37:42.550]  This was 20 years ago, 25 years ago.
[37:42.610 --> 37:43.150]  He did that.
[37:43.590 --> 37:46.730]  It was it was it was a little old lady who thought, oh, he seems like a young,
[37:47.150 --> 37:48.270]  a good young lad.
[37:48.330 --> 37:49.550]  And now look, everyone's laughing.
[37:49.650 --> 37:51.730]  He must be that like he's delightful.
[37:51.870 --> 37:52.530]  What a little comedian.
[37:52.530 --> 37:55.630]  And she's she's, you know, she's passed on since then.
[37:55.630 --> 37:56.830]  But she was a lovely woman.
[37:57.610 --> 37:59.770]  Shall I say shall I say what the punch lines were?
[37:59.910 --> 38:00.310]  Yes, please.
[38:01.030 --> 38:02.390]  Wait, what? No, wait, what?
[38:03.350 --> 38:03.970]  What? What?
[38:04.130 --> 38:06.410]  Why would you have to hear what you came up with as the joke?
[38:07.590 --> 38:09.890]  I thought the whole point would be to say the joke
[38:09.890 --> 38:12.950]  and then they would hear the punch line as opposed to you
[38:13.530 --> 38:17.370]  saying the punch line and then us telling a joke for a punch line
[38:17.370 --> 38:19.830]  that has already been said that feels backwards.
[38:20.010 --> 38:20.870]  I mean, it's your thing.
[38:21.110 --> 38:22.090]  We'll do whatever you want to do.
[38:22.350 --> 38:23.350]  I just assumed that.
[38:23.490 --> 38:24.790]  I don't know which way we should do it.
[38:24.850 --> 38:25.610]  Well, this is your bit.
[38:26.210 --> 38:27.290]  Eric, Eric, help.
[38:27.590 --> 38:29.810]  I mean, I mean, the way that Gavin
[38:29.810 --> 38:32.770]  was going to do it, I thought that it was going to be he gives you the punch line
[38:32.770 --> 38:37.190]  and then you guys go backwards and write the joke and it leads to the punch line.
[38:37.310 --> 38:38.950]  So there's a build that you're going to.
[38:40.730 --> 38:42.730]  But Andrew's saying, what if we tell the whole joke?
[38:42.810 --> 38:45.290]  And then when it's punch line time, Gavin delivers the punch line
[38:45.830 --> 38:47.470]  is never going to get a laugh.
[38:47.590 --> 38:48.770]  So I think we should do it that way.
[38:48.990 --> 38:50.550]  None of these are getting a laugh anyway.
[38:50.630 --> 38:51.810]  You don't know the source material.
[38:52.010 --> 38:54.650]  I also didn't intend for Gavin to deliver the punch line.
[38:55.030 --> 38:57.370]  You wrote, but but you you wrote the punch line.
[38:57.410 --> 38:58.690]  I think you should deliver the punch line.
[38:58.690 --> 39:00.450]  I regret asking you your opinion.
[39:01.870 --> 39:03.450]  I actually like that idea.
[39:04.070 --> 39:05.370]  I mean, doesn't that make sense?
[39:06.410 --> 39:08.110]  I mean, it doesn't.
[39:08.430 --> 39:11.950]  It is sort of an odd thing for a person to tell 95 percent of the joke
[39:11.950 --> 39:13.430]  and then hand off the punch line.
[39:13.650 --> 39:16.610]  To be fair, Gavin, Gavin wrote the punch line.
[39:17.030 --> 39:17.850]  Yeah, he did.
[39:18.070 --> 39:19.030]  I was just going to read.
[39:19.270 --> 39:21.970]  I was just going to read the punch lines and then we would go to your jokes.
[39:22.490 --> 39:25.650]  I mean, if we're putting this in the world of reality,
[39:25.790 --> 39:28.490]  Gavin does have a point in which if somebody wrote a comedian
[39:28.490 --> 39:32.850]  a joke, they don't get prompted in the crowd to swing it home.
[39:33.510 --> 39:37.490]  But I like the idea of Gavin saying the punch line to these jokes.
[39:37.570 --> 39:39.650]  OK, we'll do it however you have a way that you can like.
[39:40.210 --> 39:42.330]  Could you? Well, it's your bit. It's your decision.
[39:43.390 --> 39:45.150]  You should go with it, whatever you want, Gavin.
[39:46.910 --> 39:48.250]  You got a lot of choices here.
[39:48.470 --> 39:49.590]  Yeah, I don't know. I'm overwhelmed.
[39:50.430 --> 39:51.490]  Andrew, tell your joke.
[39:51.930 --> 39:53.030]  Well, I have to tell my joke.
[39:53.130 --> 39:54.490]  Well, is that what you want, Gavin?
[39:55.330 --> 39:56.630]  Let me pull up the punch lines.
[39:56.730 --> 39:57.630]  I'll tell you what the audience wants.
[39:57.630 --> 39:58.870]  The audience wants a decision.
[39:59.330 --> 40:02.450]  So the punch lines were like two of them are like anecdotal jokes.
[40:02.650 --> 40:06.770]  And the third one was just like a set up line, punch line sort of joke.
[40:07.310 --> 40:08.190]  Geoff, you tell your joke.
[40:08.630 --> 40:10.830]  No, I called. I said you tell your joke first.
[40:11.210 --> 40:13.170]  First of all, I'll tell you why you have to tell your joke first,
[40:13.270 --> 40:15.490]  because you pick the punch line.
[40:15.870 --> 40:18.910]  You staked claim to a punch line.
[40:19.190 --> 40:19.910]  No, I didn't.
[40:20.430 --> 40:22.670]  I regret everything about this stupid bit.
[40:23.150 --> 40:24.990]  This is going to be... I can't wait.
[40:24.990 --> 40:27.770]  Genuinely, I think there were 172 in.
[40:27.890 --> 40:30.750]  I think this is genuinely the first time that I can't wait to see
[40:30.750 --> 40:32.950]  what the audience reaction to something is going to be.
[40:33.370 --> 40:36.230]  This is going to be a disaster.
[40:37.650 --> 40:39.030]  I think that's extreme.
[40:39.290 --> 40:41.030]  I just want it to be known. I didn't pick one.
[40:41.110 --> 40:42.950]  I said I had one in mind for one.
[40:43.030 --> 40:44.770]  But if you wanted it, Geoff, you could have it.
[40:45.370 --> 40:46.490]  That's not a declaration.
[40:46.910 --> 40:48.830]  That is just me saying I had something prepared.
[40:49.330 --> 40:51.430]  You said, if nobody cares, I want this one.
[40:51.490 --> 40:52.990]  And who's going to be rude and say I care?
[40:53.090 --> 40:54.190]  I was like, OK, you can have it.
[40:54.190 --> 40:55.930]  But you took you took the best one.
[40:57.230 --> 40:59.610]  The easiest one, maybe not the best one, but the easiest one.
[41:00.830 --> 41:01.470]  So please.
[41:02.710 --> 41:03.950]  Show us what you did with it.
[41:05.050 --> 41:08.730]  Well, I want that to be my closer, so I'm going to go with the other one.
[41:10.390 --> 41:12.630]  So how we divided this is I have one.
[41:13.890 --> 41:15.910]  Geoff has one, and then we're both doing one.
[41:15.990 --> 41:17.630]  So do you want to do the one we're both doing?
[41:18.410 --> 41:19.990]  Oh, I couldn't come up with one for that one.
[41:20.830 --> 41:21.550]  Which one is that?
[41:21.830 --> 41:23.370]  It's a good question. Which one is it?
[41:23.810 --> 41:25.170]  Is it one, two or three?
[41:25.510 --> 41:26.630]  Two. I didn't do one.
[41:26.890 --> 41:28.370]  I had a premise, but I couldn't get there.
[41:29.070 --> 41:31.570]  Oh, well, I also have a premise and I couldn't get there.
[41:31.630 --> 41:32.230]  I'll tell you something.
[41:32.570 --> 41:35.830]  I've never wanted a bit to be cut out more than this bit right now.
[41:35.990 --> 41:38.550]  Yeah, but you can't say that because you'll turn the audience against us.
[41:39.090 --> 41:39.650]  Yeah. What do you mean?
[41:39.710 --> 41:40.950]  I don't know about it. What do you mean?
[41:41.430 --> 41:43.050]  Are you ready? Are you ready for this joke?
[41:43.350 --> 41:44.150]  I want to hear it.
[41:44.410 --> 41:46.370]  OK, now, Gavin, you're going to yell the punchline, OK?
[41:46.570 --> 41:48.150]  Because I really spice it up. OK.
[41:48.230 --> 41:52.690]  So so a couple, a couple goes in to
[41:53.710 --> 41:57.250]  a store to get their passport photos done.
[41:57.430 --> 42:01.470]  OK. And the the the she has feathered hair and they're going in.
[42:01.550 --> 42:02.750]  They get their photos done.
[42:02.850 --> 42:05.270]  They walk up to the guy behind the counter and they're like, hey,
[42:05.310 --> 42:07.910]  I would like to get some passport photos done.
[42:08.270 --> 42:10.990]  And the guy thought that was a little bit strange
[42:12.310 --> 42:14.830]  because he just it's an unusual situation.
[42:14.830 --> 42:18.650]  But he said, OK, it's $20 for both of you.
[42:18.910 --> 42:23.150]  And so he he took he gets the guy in and you got to do the thing.
[42:23.150 --> 42:24.410]  You can't smile or whatever.
[42:24.670 --> 42:25.770]  And he takes the photo.
[42:26.650 --> 42:31.310]  And then and then he he goes and he gets the the other person ready.
[42:31.470 --> 42:34.410]  And it's to make sure they understand how to sit in the chair and all that.
[42:34.510 --> 42:36.290]  And they don't know if to say smile or not.
[42:36.430 --> 42:39.130]  And then the guy the guy comments,
[42:39.690 --> 42:42.950]  I've never taken a passport photo for a goose before.
[42:43.130 --> 42:43.970]  Oh, you're doing that one.
[42:44.550 --> 42:46.530]  That's not a goose. That's my wife.
[42:49.530 --> 42:50.510]  But that's my joke.
[42:51.490 --> 42:54.690]  Oh, Christ. Oh, my God.
[42:54.690 --> 42:56.850]  You were supposed to be the best thing.
[42:56.930 --> 42:59.630]  This is literally the best thing we've ever done.
[43:00.550 --> 43:01.870]  Why would you tell my joke?
[43:02.630 --> 43:04.150]  I said one, two or three.
[43:04.250 --> 43:05.410]  And you said not the first one.
[43:05.910 --> 43:07.610]  That's one. Was that the first one?
[43:08.110 --> 43:09.230]  Yeah. Yeah. Don't do that.
[43:09.430 --> 43:10.170]  First one. That's mine.
[43:11.430 --> 43:12.870]  You said not the first one.
[43:12.910 --> 43:14.510]  Yeah. Don't do the first one. It's mine.
[43:15.870 --> 43:19.070]  I thought you meant I didn't do one for the first one.
[43:19.670 --> 43:20.770]  Don't do the first one.
[43:20.870 --> 43:22.490]  No, I said not the world.
[43:24.090 --> 43:25.610]  Well, Geoff, why don't you do it now?
[43:26.190 --> 43:27.330]  Oh, no, no. You do it now.
[43:28.050 --> 43:31.650]  So two dude geese were supposed to be at work one day,
[43:31.710 --> 43:33.790]  but they decided they wanted to play goose hooky.
[43:34.210 --> 43:35.570]  And so they were hanging out by the pond.
[43:35.670 --> 43:38.650]  They were checking out all the hot lady geese because it was just about mating
[43:38.650 --> 43:39.530]  season, you know.
[43:40.270 --> 43:42.310]  And I'll be honest, geese are misogynistic.
[43:42.430 --> 43:44.450]  I'm not. I'm not. I'm not a goose.
[43:44.510 --> 43:45.810]  I want that to be clear. This isn't me.
[43:45.910 --> 43:46.690]  These are the geese talking.
[43:47.670 --> 43:50.510]  And, you know, the geese, they're macho.
[43:50.510 --> 43:51.430]  They tend to be.
[43:51.790 --> 43:53.610]  They're kind of, I'll be honest, geese are kind of dicks.
[43:54.430 --> 43:56.650]  I'm not a big fan of geese, even less of a fan of swans.
[43:57.650 --> 44:01.490]  And anyway, they're saying stuff like, oh, look at the webs on that chick's feet.
[44:01.690 --> 44:03.450]  And whoa, check out her tail feathers.
[44:03.830 --> 44:07.670]  Well, goose number one, his wife was running goose errands that day
[44:07.670 --> 44:11.390]  and she happened to see him on the other side of the pond playing hooky.
[44:11.610 --> 44:13.030]  So she thought, I'm going to get this guy.
[44:13.090 --> 44:14.610]  He needs to be he should be at work right now.
[44:15.110 --> 44:18.210]  And so she she walks over there and get angrier and angrier
[44:18.670 --> 44:23.650]  and with good cause, too, because here he is ogling all these other geese.
[44:23.750 --> 44:27.050]  But Mrs. Goose was incredibly beautiful as far as ganders go.
[44:27.110 --> 44:30.190]  She was extremely shapely and had the softest feathers you've ever seen.
[44:30.310 --> 44:32.590]  So she comes up behind him and she taps him on the shoulder
[44:32.590 --> 44:33.930]  while he's in mid comment.
[44:34.190 --> 44:37.830]  And he and the and goose number two, who's never met his wife, spin around.
[44:38.210 --> 44:40.590]  Goose number one, his his mouth drops.
[44:40.630 --> 44:41.310]  He doesn't know what to do.
[44:41.670 --> 44:44.730]  Goose number two points at her chest and says, oh, my God,
[44:44.750 --> 44:46.330]  look at the goose bumps on that one.
[44:46.330 --> 44:49.610]  And goose number one says, that's not a goose.
[44:49.690 --> 44:51.050]  That's my wife. They go.
[44:52.150 --> 44:53.930]  So that's the only one everyone did.
[44:54.410 --> 44:59.290]  No, I want it on record that Geoff replied to the text saying,
[44:59.710 --> 45:00.710]  I've got number two.
[45:00.890 --> 45:03.490]  He specifically declared he wanted to.
[45:04.030 --> 45:05.210]  Yeah, but then I changed my mind.
[45:06.130 --> 45:07.010]  Not my fault.
[45:07.210 --> 45:08.150]  So no one did number two.
[45:08.750 --> 45:09.610]  So no one did two?
[45:09.710 --> 45:10.870]  Number two is punchline.
[45:11.110 --> 45:11.870]  Oh, have you done one?
[45:12.310 --> 45:15.050]  No, I couldn't get there, but I had a premise.
[45:15.230 --> 45:15.850]  I'll tell you that after.
[45:15.850 --> 45:18.450]  Number two's punchline was, beats me.
[45:18.650 --> 45:19.750]  He wasn't even wearing them.
[45:20.250 --> 45:23.670]  I was trying to write a joke there about a kid who kept jacking off
[45:23.670 --> 45:27.110]  into his tube socks and having to keep asking mom for more tube socks.
[45:27.250 --> 45:29.570]  And she didn't understand where they were going because he wasn't wearing them.
[45:29.610 --> 45:32.230]  She never saw them, but I just couldn't figure it out.
[45:33.170 --> 45:36.230]  I got lost with him trying to bury the tube socks in the backyard.
[45:36.450 --> 45:36.810]  And I just.
[45:36.990 --> 45:40.470]  It's really funny to me that that's what you had in your head when you declared,
[45:40.630 --> 45:42.170]  oh, I got this. I got two.
[45:42.450 --> 45:45.410]  And it never went past that.
[45:46.190 --> 45:48.510]  This is genuinely my favorite.
[45:51.110 --> 45:52.050]  Are you ready?
[45:52.590 --> 45:55.230]  We would have breezed by this if Geoff didn't over it.
[45:55.290 --> 45:57.510]  And I think I don't think any of us remember this bit.
[45:59.070 --> 46:01.190]  Oh, so now are we doing joke number three?
[46:01.290 --> 46:01.930]  Am I closing?
[46:02.450 --> 46:04.370]  What was your premise for that when you said you had one as well?
[46:05.410 --> 46:07.290]  No, I didn't. I did the first one.
[46:07.430 --> 46:10.690]  I thought you'd do two, and then we'd both do one of them.
[46:11.190 --> 46:13.070]  One, even though we didn't communicate that.
[46:13.070 --> 46:14.530]  Um, OK.
[46:15.090 --> 46:17.610]  I have tears running down my face listening to this.
[46:17.690 --> 46:19.530]  Well, Gavin, you got to get ready for the punchline.
[46:19.570 --> 46:21.170]  This is so fucking funny.
[46:21.350 --> 46:23.330]  I love this. I love the way it's structured.
[46:23.610 --> 46:25.170]  I love that everyone got homework.
[46:25.450 --> 46:26.670]  I love that no one likes it.
[46:26.850 --> 46:30.510]  This is genuinely everything that this podcast is about.
[46:30.890 --> 46:32.010]  It's fantastic.
[46:32.990 --> 46:36.710]  OK, so this is the premise for the third joke.
[46:38.090 --> 46:42.850]  Is we're in a bar and the door swings open, walks in, sits down next to a guy.
[46:43.070 --> 46:45.010]  Immediately says to the guy,
[46:46.030 --> 46:50.230]  weakening economy convinces Central Bank to hold key rate for now.
[46:51.050 --> 46:52.210]  And the guy says, what?
[46:52.750 --> 46:54.070]  And it says back to him.
[46:54.370 --> 46:58.670]  The Bank of Canada decided to hold its key interest rates steady on Wednesday
[46:58.670 --> 47:01.750]  and been mounting evidence the economy is slowing.
[47:01.990 --> 47:05.850]  But the Central Bank isn't declaring victory yet, as it remains cautious
[47:05.850 --> 47:08.510]  to not feel speculation about rate cuts.
[47:08.710 --> 47:12.810]  With recent evidence that excess demand in the economy is easing,
[47:13.070 --> 47:15.890]  and given the lagging effects of monetary policy,
[47:16.510 --> 47:20.190]  governing council decided to hold the policy interest rate at five percent.
[47:20.610 --> 47:23.630]  The Central Bank said in a news release, however, the Bank of Canada
[47:23.630 --> 47:27.750]  is keeping the door open to more rate hikes, noting its governing
[47:27.750 --> 47:30.950]  council is still concerned about inflationary pressures
[47:30.950 --> 47:34.570]  and is ready to raise interest rates further if needed.
[47:35.110 --> 47:37.990]  Canada's inflation rate was three point three percent in July,
[47:38.450 --> 47:41.570]  ticking up from two point eight percent in the previous month.
[47:41.570 --> 47:45.150]  Although inflation has slowed considerably since last summer,
[47:45.510 --> 47:49.370]  it's expected to hover around three percent for months to come.
[47:49.470 --> 47:53.150]  The Central Bank acknowledges that inflation will even likely flare up
[47:53.150 --> 47:56.190]  due to higher gasoline prices before coming back down.
[47:56.670 --> 48:00.170]  BMO chief economist Douglas Porter said the Bank of Canada's decision
[48:00.170 --> 48:05.470]  to hold its key rate was widely expected, given recent weak economic data.
[48:05.910 --> 48:08.930]  Now the focus is turning to what the central bank might do as next.
[48:08.930 --> 48:12.110]  It wrestles inflation down while trying not to send the economy
[48:12.110 --> 48:14.550]  into a deeper slowdown than necessary.
[48:15.070 --> 48:17.810]  They've clearly left the door open for possibility that they might
[48:18.410 --> 48:19.990]  move again, Porter said.
[48:20.310 --> 48:23.630]  But our view is that provided growth remains relatively calm
[48:23.630 --> 48:26.370]  and core inflation does continue to slowly come down,
[48:26.650 --> 48:29.330]  that the Bank of Canada is probably done hiking interest rates.
[48:29.850 --> 48:33.970]  Statistics Canada reported last week real gross domestic product
[48:33.970 --> 48:37.810]  contracted in the second quarter, which is forecasters
[48:37.810 --> 48:40.310]  that another rate hike would be unlikely.
[48:40.830 --> 48:43.310]  The Canadian economy has entered a period of weaker growth,
[48:43.410 --> 48:47.010]  which is needed to relieve price pressures, the central bank said.
[48:47.410 --> 48:50.390]  Canada's labor market has almost lost some of its steam.
[48:50.590 --> 48:53.570]  The unemployment rate has been on the rise for three consecutive months.
[48:53.990 --> 48:56.710]  Porter says economic growth will likely continue to stall
[48:56.710 --> 48:59.870]  over the next few quarters, making a recession a possibility.
[49:00.390 --> 49:02.910]  We're not going to the official recession definition,
[49:03.330 --> 49:06.370]  but it's going to be a close run for sure, Porter said.
[49:06.370 --> 49:11.550]  Reaction from Canadian commercial banks on Wednesday was nearly uniform.
[49:11.690 --> 49:15.490]  The central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates again,
[49:15.870 --> 49:18.430]  despite its hawkish tone Wednesday.
[49:19.110 --> 49:22.650]  But in order to keep inflation expectations in check,
[49:23.070 --> 49:30.930]  Economist Tu Nguyen with accounting and consultancy firm RSM Canada
[49:30.930 --> 49:35.850]  said the Bank of Canada will likely hold its key interest rate at 5% in 2024.
[49:36.370 --> 49:40.390]  A premature rate cut could send businesses and consumers out burrowing
[49:40.390 --> 49:43.970]  and spending risk reaccelerating inflation again,
[49:44.190 --> 49:45.370]  Nguyen said in a statement.
[49:45.970 --> 49:48.570]  Now, the guy replied, I didn't know any of that.
[49:48.590 --> 49:53.390]  To which the response to that was Biden cancels oil and gas
[49:53.390 --> 49:55.350]  lease in Arctic Refuge.
[49:57.610 --> 50:01.550]  Juno, Alaska, in an aggressive move that angered Republicans,
[50:01.550 --> 50:07.790]  the Biden administration canceled the seven remaining oil and gas leases
[50:07.790 --> 50:12.110]  in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on Wednesday,
[50:12.850 --> 50:16.910]  overturning sales held in the Trump administration's waning days
[50:16.910 --> 50:19.910]  and proposed strong protections against...
[50:22.830 --> 50:24.170]  Oh, you ruined the joke.
[50:25.130 --> 50:27.510]  Oh, you weren't done? No.
[50:27.510 --> 50:31.750]  Oh, stepped on my punch line.
[50:31.870 --> 50:34.670]  Sorry. Sorry, I went on it. Go on, keep going.
[50:36.330 --> 50:37.230]  I lost my place.
[50:37.410 --> 50:38.410]  I'll have to start from the beginning.
[50:38.710 --> 50:41.050]  In an aggressive move that angered Republicans,
[50:41.650 --> 50:45.470]  the Biden administration canceled the seven remaining oil and gas leases.
[50:45.530 --> 50:48.750]  I thought it'd be something like, you know, something about running a story.
[50:49.030 --> 50:50.850]  I don't know. A newspaper with legs.
[50:50.990 --> 50:53.470]  I don't know. Like a real quickster.
[50:53.830 --> 50:56.250]  Like, what do you call Pete Davidson at the beach?
[50:56.250 --> 50:57.670]  A newspaper with legs.
[50:57.810 --> 51:00.250]  Because he's got all the shitty tattoos that are all over his body.
[51:00.470 --> 51:01.670]  Something like that. That was ideal.
[51:02.910 --> 51:07.770]  No, so this what I did is I bought a newspaper and I was just going to
[51:07.770 --> 51:11.330]  I was just reading the stories of the paper. Right.
[51:11.430 --> 51:12.790]  And I was just going to keep doing this.
[51:12.870 --> 51:16.750]  And then eventually the guy would get mad and then the bartender would say,
[51:16.890 --> 51:18.050]  Hey, you can't get mad at him.
[51:18.050 --> 51:19.650]  He's a newspaper with legs.
[51:20.010 --> 51:22.550]  Because he's going to I was going to read the whole paper
[51:22.550 --> 51:24.470]  and then say the next day it happened again.
[51:24.470 --> 51:27.870]  But it was the same stories because he's he got printed on that day.
[51:28.190 --> 51:30.110]  So just be the same thing every day.
[51:30.170 --> 51:31.730]  That was the whole thing. You got pretty cut it off.
[51:31.850 --> 51:33.050]  Well, sorry. I'm sorry to cut it off.
[51:33.370 --> 51:34.850]  Yeah, I would have loved to have heard.
[51:36.430 --> 51:39.250]  Listen, the people are going to want to know about felony convictions
[51:40.110 --> 51:40.930]  vacated for U.S.
[51:40.970 --> 51:43.270]  Navy officers and bribery scandal, but they'll never know.
[51:43.390 --> 51:46.710]  Well, well, this episode need a credit to the person who wrote that newspaper.
[51:47.050 --> 51:48.770]  Like it was it was like 20 percent.
[51:49.610 --> 51:50.510]  Oh, the smileys.
[51:50.510 --> 51:54.550]  Uh. I, I never got around to mention it to you guys,
[51:54.650 --> 51:57.530]  but I cooked these for this episode so I can try them.
[51:57.790 --> 51:59.030]  Oh, how are they?
[51:59.250 --> 52:00.150]  I don't know. I haven't eaten them yet.
[52:00.390 --> 52:01.110]  They've been going cold.
[52:01.250 --> 52:02.430]  Why haven't you been reading the newspaper?
[52:06.450 --> 52:08.590]  Did you salt them? Are you doing any condiments?
[52:08.790 --> 52:10.630]  What's the no, they're just I'm just having a plane.
[52:10.670 --> 52:12.110]  I'm having a pure. I want to try it right now.
[52:12.270 --> 52:13.190]  Should we see you eat them?
[52:13.470 --> 52:16.050]  Yeah. No condiments on, you know, me.
[52:17.490 --> 52:18.650]  OK, here we go.
[52:20.110 --> 52:22.330]  It's it was warm 30 minutes ago.
[52:22.370 --> 52:22.930]  We'll see.
[52:25.470 --> 52:26.410]  I smiley face.
[52:26.730 --> 52:29.210]  Millie texted me typically is some ketchup in the eyes.
[52:29.810 --> 52:32.450]  Millie texted me today and she said, what the fuck are those?
[52:32.530 --> 52:36.170]  And I was she said they look like deep fried scrub daddies.
[52:36.650 --> 52:39.490]  Did you apologize for preventing her from experiencing them as a child?
[52:40.990 --> 52:42.410]  No. Oh.
[52:43.950 --> 52:46.250]  Doesn't taste like anything. Huh?
[52:48.650 --> 52:51.810]  Well, could it possibly be because you didn't season them in any way?
[52:54.770 --> 52:58.570]  I guess. I mean, I don't season tater tots.
[52:58.690 --> 53:00.630]  They taste good out out of the fucking oven.
[53:03.370 --> 53:04.590]  I'm jealous you're in one of those.
[53:04.810 --> 53:07.370]  I can always feel what that tastes like.
[53:07.690 --> 53:08.650]  Well, you have a bag.
[53:09.910 --> 53:10.910]  Yeah, I didn't cook them up, though.
[53:11.590 --> 53:13.170]  That's fair. It's OK.
[53:13.310 --> 53:15.250]  Maybe it's probably better hot, but better hot.
[53:16.850 --> 53:18.170]  It's better before the jokes.
[53:20.510 --> 53:25.730]  When they were hot before the newspaper, they were probably pretty good.
[53:25.870 --> 53:28.510]  So are you blaming Gavin for that, for sidetracking your bit?
[53:30.430 --> 53:31.210]  No, not at all.
[53:31.850 --> 53:34.830]  I just wish that I just wish that I'd eaten them when they were warmer
[53:34.830 --> 53:37.650]  because I I let the episode get away from me.
[53:37.670 --> 53:40.030]  I was going to do it right out the gate and then I just got distracted.
[53:40.210 --> 53:40.950]  It's nobody's fault but mine.
[53:44.030 --> 53:45.510]  Anyway, they're like, whatever, they're six.
[53:46.650 --> 53:51.330]  Well, I apologize for the worst bit in face history.
[53:53.030 --> 53:54.270]  Oh, I disagree.
[53:55.350 --> 53:59.450]  Yeah, I was going to ask you guys, do you think this was a legit?
[54:00.070 --> 54:01.610]  Do you think this was a this?
[54:01.750 --> 54:03.430]  Do you think this was our first bad episode?
[54:05.150 --> 54:07.510]  No. OK, I mean, do you think this is one of like,
[54:07.610 --> 54:09.090]  do you think this was a bad episode?
[54:09.690 --> 54:10.670]  No. OK.
[54:11.110 --> 54:12.470]  Do you think this was our best episode?
[54:12.870 --> 54:15.370]  Well, I don't know, because I laughed a lot, but I don't know if
[54:15.970 --> 54:18.010]  that's a good brummer. Yeah.
[54:18.430 --> 54:21.550]  I'm thinking about someone driving to work and they're listening to Andrew
[54:21.550 --> 54:23.170]  read the newspaper like it's NPR.
[54:23.790 --> 54:27.410]  And it's a comedy podcast where you guys talked about Starfield,
[54:27.710 --> 54:29.730]  Baba Booey and Potato Smiley's.
[54:29.890 --> 54:32.510]  But we also heard a lot of the newspaper.
[54:36.190 --> 54:37.690]  Listen, that wasn't my choice.
[54:37.690 --> 54:38.870]  Gavin made the punchline.
[54:39.070 --> 54:40.190]  I was just following through.
[54:42.330 --> 54:43.410]  Hey, let me ask you guys a question.
[54:44.030 --> 54:45.110]  There's something I was thinking about the other day.
[54:45.230 --> 54:46.250]  Let's see what you guys think about it.
[54:46.390 --> 54:48.830]  What do you think the most important letter in the alphabet is?
[54:49.430 --> 54:50.690]  I have an answer. I have an answer.
[54:50.850 --> 54:51.370]  I'm going to convince you.
[54:52.550 --> 54:54.250]  You said P as in Paul? No, T.
[54:54.690 --> 54:55.950]  Oh, T as in Tom? OK.
[54:57.030 --> 54:59.210]  I feel like R is pretty important. R.
[54:59.430 --> 55:01.230]  Eric, you know what? I'm going to go.
[55:01.330 --> 55:02.570]  I was thinking a consonant.
[55:02.690 --> 55:04.330]  I'm going with a vowel. I'm going with A.
[55:05.010 --> 55:06.350]  OK. A is a good one.
[55:06.350 --> 55:07.970]  I think it's great. I think it's arguably.
[55:08.170 --> 55:09.750]  I think it's definitely more important than the other two.
[55:09.870 --> 55:11.830]  I think the correct answer is E.
[55:12.450 --> 55:14.450]  And here's why. Have you ever said the alphabet?
[55:14.910 --> 55:18.170]  You can't even you can't even pronounce most letters without E.
[55:18.470 --> 55:26.690]  You've got B, C, D, E, G, H, K.
[55:29.430 --> 55:33.350]  And he was he was going so well and it was going great.
[55:33.350 --> 55:41.150]  S, T, V, X, Z.
[55:42.150 --> 55:43.330]  You can't pronounce it.
[55:43.630 --> 55:47.110]  You can't even have like 16 letters without the letter E.
[55:47.730 --> 55:50.050]  It's woven into the fabric of all other letters.
[55:50.210 --> 55:52.430]  It is the it is the Trojan horse of letters.
[55:52.810 --> 55:56.190]  So if we had what what is the what are the bless you?
[55:56.390 --> 56:00.190]  What are the letters that we can use that don't contain E's?
[56:00.210 --> 56:02.330]  Like if we had to go E-less, what would our bank of letters be?
[56:02.330 --> 56:05.950]  A. Uh, I guess not F.
[56:06.110 --> 56:07.270]  F has an E sound in it.
[56:08.350 --> 56:10.950]  H, like F. That's an E.
[56:11.270 --> 56:13.590]  H. Yeah. I agree.
[56:14.210 --> 56:18.490]  J, K. M, N.
[56:18.990 --> 56:21.350]  Not M. M definitely has an E.
[56:21.350 --> 56:24.370]  M. I guess if you say M or M, M is an E. Yeah.
[56:24.790 --> 56:27.430]  N, O. O is a good one.
[56:28.750 --> 56:30.250]  Q. Yeah, there's no good.
[56:30.890 --> 56:31.530]  Yeah, no.
[56:31.910 --> 56:32.890]  Dregs of letters. Not great.
[56:33.290 --> 56:35.210]  I don't know why, but it just it's popped into my head.
[56:35.310 --> 56:39.410]  Like, it's weird that you need letters to pronounce other letters.
[56:39.810 --> 56:42.070]  What if we try and come up with the longest E-less word?
[56:42.870 --> 56:44.770]  Well, I think Google could help us with that real fast.
[56:45.590 --> 56:49.910]  What is the longest word with no E?
[56:53.250 --> 56:57.490]  Definitely transubstantial, transubstantiationalist.
[56:57.490 --> 57:01.250]  Yeah, but that's not... Substantiationalist.
[57:01.290 --> 57:04.370]  Oh, transubstantial. It's without an E sound.
[57:04.470 --> 57:06.710]  Yeah, and T has an E. Yeah.
[57:07.590 --> 57:08.710]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.
[57:10.610 --> 57:11.050]  Train.
[57:13.450 --> 57:16.090]  Train. What?
[57:16.390 --> 57:16.490]  Crap.
[57:18.730 --> 57:20.590]  I still can't think of a word without an E sound.
[57:20.890 --> 57:22.810]  Rhythm? Train? Rhythm.
[57:23.650 --> 57:25.230]  Yeah, but that's still not the right...
[57:25.230 --> 57:26.610]  That's not using the right letters.
[57:26.610 --> 57:27.710]  Right. I get what you're saying.
[57:28.010 --> 57:29.970]  Oh, I see. Without using any of the alphabet,
[57:30.110 --> 57:32.270]  I thought we were just doing a long, no E sound word.
[57:32.390 --> 57:33.570]  I understand now. Yeah.
[57:34.070 --> 57:35.530]  Yeah, all the shit that Geoff just said.
[57:38.980 --> 57:41.980]  It definitely, if there was going to be an election amongst the letters,
[57:42.080 --> 57:43.260]  it has the most supporters.
[57:43.580 --> 57:45.560]  Oh, dude, are you kidding?
[57:46.520 --> 57:49.960]  The other letters fucking lie on E in a large part.
[57:50.480 --> 57:52.800]  Can you imagine if there was no E, how much fucking heavy lifting
[57:52.800 --> 57:54.300]  A would have to do to pick up the slack?
[57:56.320 --> 57:58.340]  Ape. Ape. Say.
[58:03.900 --> 58:06.700]  Day. Ape.
[58:07.660 --> 58:11.780]  Ape. Gay. Gay.
[58:12.800 --> 58:16.780]  Hey. Oh, my God.
[58:18.660 --> 58:20.700]  A newspaper with legs.
[58:23.960 --> 58:26.580]  Okay, this is now a fever dream.
[58:27.180 --> 58:29.920]  Beats me. He wasn't even wearing them.
[58:30.020 --> 58:31.320]  Did you ever use any of those, Gavin?
[58:31.760 --> 58:34.120]  Were those originals or were those from your past hits?
[58:34.340 --> 58:37.500]  I think I used the top one, but the other ones, the other two are fresh.
[58:39.280 --> 58:40.180]  Fresh is a word.
[58:40.920 --> 58:42.740]  Well, I didn't really have to change them
[58:42.740 --> 58:44.640]  because I don't think we ever walked past the same person twice.
[58:45.160 --> 58:48.280]  This might be the first time I've ever bought a newspaper in my life today.
[58:48.520 --> 58:49.640]  Do you think it'll be the last time?
[58:51.320 --> 58:53.080]  Uh, sadly, yeah, probably.
[58:53.760 --> 58:56.760]  I had a I had a thought about you, Gavin, the other day.
[58:57.060 --> 58:58.260]  Oh, oh, yeah.
[58:58.560 --> 59:01.440]  I you know, I've been I've been reading a lot lately
[59:01.440 --> 59:03.280]  because somebody got me a Kindle.
[59:03.440 --> 59:06.140]  And so and I've also been watching a lot of documentaries.
[59:06.240 --> 59:09.140]  I've been I've been really focused on or really interested in
[59:09.140 --> 59:13.580]  in early 20th century explorers, like people that explore the Amazon
[59:13.580 --> 59:17.560]  or the desert or the Antarctica or whatever.
[59:18.200 --> 59:21.820]  And it it struck me, and I'm sure a lot of this has to do
[59:21.820 --> 59:25.220]  with colonization and wealth and the opportunity that wealth provides.
[59:25.320 --> 59:28.120]  But it struck me that over the last like 200 years,
[59:28.640 --> 59:32.640]  most of the great explorers or the most successful explorers
[59:32.640 --> 59:34.360]  in the world have been British.
[59:35.200 --> 59:36.780]  Or from the UK, right?
[59:37.120 --> 59:39.400]  Like the people that have made all the major discoveries in the Amazon
[59:39.400 --> 59:42.920]  and the Antarctica and in the Himalayas, and they're almost always British,
[59:43.460 --> 59:47.060]  almost as if they had like a monopoly on adventure and bravery.
[59:48.320 --> 59:49.500]  But then there's you.
[59:52.040 --> 59:52.800]  And that was my thought.
[59:52.960 --> 59:56.580]  It's like these people, these these British men would submit themselves
[59:56.580 --> 01:00:02.060]  to like all all manner of danger from the environment, from animals, from man.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:05.040]  They're fighting stuff like dengue fever and crocodiles.
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:09.360]  And then there's you, a guy who can't wash dishes without gloves.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.540]  How did that happen?
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.680]  I mean, I could do it. It just makes my hands feel funny.
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.940]  Same with emptying a fresh dishwasher.
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:25.000]  If the plates and glasses are still hot, they're too grippy.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.560]  You know, there's like a weird grip factor that happens that makes me feel funny.
[01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:36.190]  I think what's impressive about Gavin is how many states have you been to?
[01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:37.650]  Like 30 of the states?
[01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:39.830]  26 or something.
[01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:42.870]  So the problem with him is that he's well traveled.
[01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:45.050]  He just hasn't done anything in any of these places.
[01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:46.350]  He hasn't discovered anything.
[01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:47.650]  Well, what's left to discover?
[01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:48.610]  Look, I'm born.
[01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:52.610]  I was born in the very, very small window
[01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:56.370]  of human history where you can't explore shit.
[01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:57.210]  All right.
[01:00:57.630 --> 01:01:01.210]  It's everything on Earth is mapped, you know, maybe aside from the ocean.
[01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:04.650]  And it's right before everyone pisses off and explores space.
[01:01:04.790 --> 01:01:05.570]  I've got nothing.
[01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:08.570]  If I wanted to be an explorer, I was born
[01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:11.330]  at the at the complete wrong time, and it's bullshit.
[01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:13.070]  Hold on a second.
[01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:14.030]  Do you want to be an explorer?
[01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:17.930]  How many how much of the Earth?
[01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:21.930]  I've also I've discovered like 50 new species in Starfield.
[01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.950]  It really doesn't feel hard.
[01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:25.130]  I'm questioning your your work ethic here.
[01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:26.070]  You think I just haven't made the effort?
[01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:27.890]  I think so. I don't think.
[01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:30.030]  Well, I mean, I've got I've got my mushrooms in my slime.
[01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:31.730]  I think potentially that that's true.
[01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:33.270]  Hey, oh, yeah, but that's in your backyard.
[01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:34.810]  We've seen the slime in person.
[01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:35.630]  Yeah, it's funny.
[01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:37.090]  Yeah, we've we've seen the slime.
[01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:38.530]  I'll take this from all the heat.
[01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:41.170]  It's it's not it doesn't look good.
[01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:42.770]  It doesn't look like it's supposed to be there.
[01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:45.150]  And it doesn't look like something that you should just leave alone.
[01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:48.210]  But he Gavin seems determined to ignore it.
[01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:51.170]  Well, if I was an explorer, I'm not I'm not there to displace
[01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:53.350]  the people already there or mess with the ecosystem.
[01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:54.390]  I'm just here to observe.
[01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:57.010]  Well, that's not very British of you now, is it?
[01:01:57.070 --> 01:01:57.770]  Not really. No.
[01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:58.190]  Well, I'm Italian.
[01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:59.250]  So according to.
[01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:04.810]  Yeah, they have a much better record.
[01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:06.390]  It's classically known for not displacing people.
[01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:07.110]  Not much better.
[01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:11.250]  Gavin, you'll be happy to know
[01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:14.690]  and maybe this will awaken something inside of you, deep inside of you
[01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:16.910]  from your ancestry, but I'm a guess not.
[01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:21.890]  Sixty five percent of the planet remains unexplored.
[01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:23.730]  Yeah, but is it under the ocean?
[01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:25.690]  Most of it, but not all of it.
[01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:27.210]  It says most of it.
[01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:30.030]  That means there's probably at least 10 percent.
[01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:30.990]  OK, can you put it?
[01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:33.450]  I'll walk around and you'll let me know if there's anything
[01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:34.670]  new to discover in this biome.
[01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:35.810]  Yeah.
[01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:40.050]  Because I don't want to be looking in the in the wrong place for a shark
[01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:41.270]  that's not on land.
[01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:45.950]  I think I think maybe let's start small before you start crossing the ocean
[01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:47.670]  or going down to the bottom of the ocean.
[01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:48.830]  Let's start small.
[01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:50.630]  Deal with your slime.
[01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:52.810]  See where the slime takes you.
[01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:55.330]  And then we'll sort of figure out if you need to, like,
[01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:57.130]  go to the Mariana Trench or something.
[01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.750]  OK, like, yeah, baby steps, I guess.
[01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:01.270]  You should do a slime scan.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.460]  Hit left bumper on your slide.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:09.280]  Yeah, but then I'll only be at 30, 13 percent, I think.
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.840]  And you've only got the one.
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.200]  Next time you travel somewhere,
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:20.280]  can you just hold your controller and just walk around clicking left bumper
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.320]  going, scanned it, got it.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.260]  Eighty eight percent.
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:26.120]  Great winner's explorer, Gavin Free.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.280]  You've even got the name for explorer.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.340]  You were born with a with an explorer's silver spoon in your mouth.
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.580]  When with the weather changing soon,
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:42.260]  as we're in mid-September, I think when this comes out like late September,
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.180]  when the weather changes, do you think your
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.480]  your slime is really going to come alive for you
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.780]  in like the back kind of half of the year or what?
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:52.980]  Yeah, I think as soon as the rain starts hitting and maybe the grass is all,
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:56.740]  you know, like dewy, I think I think the slime will reactivate
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:57.820]  and start spreading again.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.340]  Maybe I'll time lapse it.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.040]  Oh, that's interesting.
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:02.180]  I would love to see time lapse.
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:03.500]  What an episode.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.240]  I don't think what an episode.
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.840]  That kind of makes you think it was good.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.580]  I think it was good. I had a good time.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.440]  You laughed a lot for someone who's not having a good time.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:13.460]  I had a great time.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.860]  I just I'm trying to imagine it from an audience perspective.
[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:20.700]  Your response to my question was very fucking funny.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:21.500]  Very good.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.380]  Now, that's definitely a highlight of an episode right there.
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.440]  OK, I think I think that's a good place to end it, too,
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.780]  because we're kind of leaving on a high note.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.840]  They're going to hopefully forget about when Andrew read the newspaper
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.120]  for like four minutes.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.560]  Hey, well, there you have it.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:38.600]  You've listened to another episode of the Face podcast.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.100]  How much fun was that?
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.020]  What do you think?
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:42.660]  Was this the best episode we've ever done?
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.780]  Early reports are no, but you don't never know.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.320]  We'll see. It could be like the election.
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:50.680]  Who knows how many votes are going to come in at 3 a.m.?
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.860]  We'll see you next time.
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.540]  Six teams bring their best recipes to.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:57.240]  Oh, shit.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:03.380]  It's a ghosty of patrons for weekend feast of ribs cooked by world class rib teams.
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:04.540]  Wash down.
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.420]  I know we're done.
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.180]  It's over.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.720]  I'm going to be entertained by live music from local bands
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.400]  at Eskimo Rib Fest this year.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.740]  The event, established in 2013, boasts six big rig bar.
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:19.980]  What if Jack just says next time on a local craft?
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.260]  Cut straight back to them.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.880]  More than 20 live performances on stage.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:27.680]  The tasty fun runs from Friday to Sunday at Bullen Park.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.180]  The event has such a happy vibe to it.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:33.720]  It still has the feel of an outside house party in someone's backyard.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.540]  I'm trying to figure out how to kick him.
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.080]  Chair of the Rib Fest Society, which hosts the event.
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:44.280]  The event is limited to six barbecue companies with smoked dem bones.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:48.660]  A company from Kamloops joining the roster this year.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.840]  In the spirit of friendly competition, the rules remember
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.180]  uh, members of the... I'm trying to read through mine.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:56.360]  There's no other choice.
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:58.160]  All the papers folded.
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:02.740]  Yeah, uh, ribbers, members of the rib teams bring their best ribs
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:04.600]  and best rib sauces to the festival.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.540]  Look for judging panels and bragging rights if they win the People's Choice Award.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.120]  I'm cutting out. Look for newcomers.
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:14.500]  Hey, guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:16.700]  There's a new achievement in Gyms of War.
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.640]  Gavin has a terrible reputation.
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.160]  Who is the most competitive?
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.680]  Are Twiglets delicious?
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:22.940]  The boys are alone.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.580]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.460]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:54.700]  has in conjunction with the Eskimo Firefighters Charitable Foundation
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.580]  and seven local nonprofit groups
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:00.800]  raised more than one million over the past nine years.
