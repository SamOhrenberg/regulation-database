[01:23.000 --> 01:23.640]  Not. Nope.
[01:24.480 --> 01:24.840]  He's hello.
[01:25.980 --> 01:29.940]  He f***ing did it. He did. He did the countdown.
[01:31.520 --> 01:34.080]  Hello and welcome to another episode of F*** Face.
[01:34.080 --> 01:35.980]  This is episode 173.
[01:36.080 --> 01:44.960]  Geoff Ramsey, Andrew Pantin, Gavin Frey here to entertain you for the next 55 to 65 minutes or so.
[01:45.980 --> 01:46.400]  Hello.
[01:47.340 --> 01:50.080]  Hey, we're here to, I don't know, you like this?
[01:50.640 --> 01:51.540]  How do you like it so far?
[01:52.140 --> 01:53.080]  How's everybody doing?
[01:53.500 --> 01:53.980]  I'm doing good.
[01:54.320 --> 01:57.500]  You told one joke, you went to stand up comedy mode immediately.
[01:57.660 --> 01:58.340]  You're like a comic.
[01:58.800 --> 01:59.320]  What do you mean?
[01:59.340 --> 02:00.720]  Very comic vibe, like the club.
[02:00.840 --> 02:03.260]  We're here to entertain you for the rest of the evening type thing.
[02:03.260 --> 02:04.740]  It felt good to stand up to me.
[02:05.240 --> 02:06.860]  I'll take that as a huge compliment.
[02:07.020 --> 02:07.560]  I appreciate it.
[02:07.600 --> 02:08.180]  Thank you so much.
[02:08.280 --> 02:09.860]  It's one of the kinder things you've ever said to me.
[02:10.120 --> 02:12.640]  I don't know about that, but I appreciate that you brought it up.
[02:13.320 --> 02:18.160]  I feel like every 10 or so episodes, I like to check in on long running F*** Face bits.
[02:19.100 --> 02:19.940]  Andrew, how's the ankles?
[02:20.540 --> 02:20.960]  Oh, great.
[02:21.220 --> 02:22.220]  No ankle problems at all.
[02:22.600 --> 02:23.060]  Much better.
[02:23.380 --> 02:24.760]  I'd say this has been a great year for ankles.
[02:25.180 --> 02:26.320]  Marathon coming up this year?
[02:26.700 --> 02:28.440]  No, I already said no to that.
[02:28.620 --> 02:28.820]  All right.
[02:28.960 --> 02:29.100]  That's dead.
[02:29.160 --> 02:30.200]  Oh, that's dead, dead forever.
[02:30.800 --> 02:31.800]  That's super dead.
[02:32.000 --> 02:32.340]  Is it?
[02:32.800 --> 02:33.980]  Maybe I wasn't here for that one.
[02:34.120 --> 02:34.760]  It's dead, dead.
[02:34.960 --> 02:36.340]  No, it's been dead for months.
[02:36.800 --> 02:39.060]  When did you sneak that to the coffin?
[02:39.200 --> 02:44.440]  I brought that up when we did our beginning of the year, end of year, last year content.
[02:44.920 --> 02:47.500]  It's in that supplemental where we went over old bits.
[02:47.680 --> 02:48.200]  I covered that.
[02:49.860 --> 02:52.340]  Oh, yeah, I think I just didn't want to believe that to be true.
[02:53.460 --> 02:54.680]  So I erased it from my memory.
[02:54.740 --> 02:55.720]  OK, so that bit's done.
[02:56.400 --> 02:56.600]  OK.
[02:57.120 --> 02:58.340]  Hey, let me ask you guys a question.
[02:59.140 --> 02:59.720]  What do you...
[02:59.720 --> 03:00.160]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:00.240 --> 03:02.020]  Gavin, were there more bits you wanted to check in on?
[03:02.020 --> 03:03.960]  I feel like there must have been more to that.
[03:04.060 --> 03:04.580]  No, that was it.
[03:05.180 --> 03:06.200]  That was it?
[03:07.420 --> 03:09.900]  Checking on Andrew, where are you at, man?
[03:10.200 --> 03:10.700]  Just me.
[03:11.340 --> 03:11.660]  OK.
[03:12.200 --> 03:14.600]  Start with a little Andrew check in at the top.
[03:15.120 --> 03:16.420]  Just put you on blast.
[03:16.560 --> 03:17.260]  Geoff, go ahead.
[03:17.500 --> 03:19.660]  I want to see how my friends doing.
[03:20.480 --> 03:20.980]  Well, could I?
[03:21.080 --> 03:23.380]  OK, well, could I tell you a mistake I made recently?
[03:23.640 --> 03:23.840]  Yeah.
[03:24.200 --> 03:26.300]  Something a little, little prank.
[03:26.300 --> 03:32.060]  So I have two friends and they've been sending, they send gag gifs to each other
[03:32.060 --> 03:35.860]  occasionally, and this has been on pause for a little bit, but they'd go back and forth.
[03:36.200 --> 03:39.680]  And then recently we're playing the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game.
[03:40.060 --> 03:43.260]  And there's a thing in that game where you have to open up a fuse box
[03:43.260 --> 03:46.820]  and you have to match the colors and solve a basic math problem
[03:46.820 --> 03:48.840]  of like, what is seven plus three?
[03:49.360 --> 03:52.580]  And it's very confusing because there's no explanation for it.
[03:52.780 --> 03:54.460]  It's really simple once you know what to do.
[03:54.560 --> 03:55.960]  But when you look at it for the first time,
[03:55.960 --> 03:56.900]  it's a little bit overwhelming.
[03:57.500 --> 04:02.440]  And so one of my friends, they solved the first one, which was seven plus three easily.
[04:02.880 --> 04:04.400]  And they did it accidentally.
[04:04.560 --> 04:05.840]  They didn't understand the color thing.
[04:06.020 --> 04:11.400]  But because of that, it looked like they could not figure out what four plus nine was.
[04:11.680 --> 04:16.820]  And so it became they got roasted that they didn't know basic math
[04:16.820 --> 04:18.320]  and they took great offense to that.
[04:18.380 --> 04:19.300]  So it became like a bit.
[04:19.820 --> 04:21.800]  And the two people that send gag gifs at each other
[04:21.800 --> 04:24.840]  were the main ones really going back and forth about it.
[04:24.840 --> 04:28.420]  And as a third party, I thought this is fantastic news for me.
[04:28.580 --> 04:30.380]  I can reignite their war.
[04:30.880 --> 04:33.860]  I will buy the guy that's being made fun of for not knowing basic math,
[04:33.980 --> 04:38.600]  a calculator under the billing name of the person who they're in the battle with.
[04:38.780 --> 04:39.940]  And so I checked.
[04:40.220 --> 04:42.840]  I couldn't remember if I'd ever mailed them anything,
[04:42.840 --> 04:47.520]  but I looked at my Amazon and their name was saved as like a joke name.
[04:47.660 --> 04:52.560]  It's fucking Brando Calrissian is like their lame like joke nickname thing.
[04:52.860 --> 04:54.820]  Yeah. So I had that and I was all excited about it.
[04:54.840 --> 04:56.740]  I was like, oh, I have their address saved.
[04:57.040 --> 04:58.920]  I definitely have the other person's information.
[04:59.320 --> 05:00.440]  This is fantastic.
[05:00.960 --> 05:05.040]  I re-signed up for Amazon Prime to get there immediately to them.
[05:05.500 --> 05:07.520]  And so I order it and I'm just waiting.
[05:07.740 --> 05:08.900]  And then the next day happens
[05:08.900 --> 05:11.440]  and the basic math thing comes up between the two of them again.
[05:11.440 --> 05:14.600]  And I'm like, oh, this is they're not going to expect me at all.
[05:14.860 --> 05:15.640]  This is great.
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.680]  And I get tracking for it and it says it will be delivered by the end of the day.
[05:19.880 --> 05:23.560]  So I'm just sitting there waiting, all excited.
[05:23.560 --> 05:25.420]  I keep checking throughout the day.
[05:25.560 --> 05:27.380]  It still says like, hey, it's on route.
[05:27.540 --> 05:30.400]  It's looking to be delivered any time now.
[05:30.740 --> 05:32.180]  No update, no update.
[05:32.400 --> 05:36.720]  It gets to the evening and I finally think like, oh, man, I should check on that.
[05:36.820 --> 05:37.680]  Was it delivered yet?
[05:38.040 --> 05:39.340]  Wasn't delivered still.
[05:39.700 --> 05:41.360]  I thought, that's really weird.
[05:41.840 --> 05:43.020]  So then I double checked it.
[05:43.480 --> 05:45.580]  I have been anticipating this all day.
[05:45.660 --> 05:46.880]  I've been so excited about this gag.
[05:47.020 --> 05:48.760]  I don't actually have their address.
[05:49.340 --> 05:51.880]  I clearly went to build it at some point.
[05:51.880 --> 05:59.580]  So it said it was trying to deliver to Brando Calrissian at Brando Calrissian Way in Arizona.
[06:00.000 --> 06:08.820]  And the number to call if you had issues was like 420-69-69-69 or whatever it was.
[06:09.260 --> 06:17.860]  But I thought that I was a prank genius while I was looking at this tracking number and was so confused as it didn't deliver.
[06:17.860 --> 06:22.280]  And I felt so stupid upon realizing, oh, they are not.
[06:22.440 --> 06:26.220]  I don't think they're going to find Brando Calrissian Avenue in Tucson, Arizona.
[06:26.520 --> 06:28.320]  I don't think that's real address.
[06:28.800 --> 06:35.020]  So I just fortunately, once again, continuing my refund streak, it went back to Amazon and I got refunded for it.
[06:35.320 --> 06:37.000]  But it ruined my bit.
[06:37.100 --> 06:38.160]  I was so excited about it.
[06:38.160 --> 06:38.740]  I felt real dumb.
[06:42.320 --> 06:44.200]  I even talk about it in something else.
[06:44.200 --> 06:48.240]  There's another piece of content that will come out where I'm telling it happened the same day.
[06:48.340 --> 06:50.320]  So I'm telling Geoff about being like, I'm a genius.
[06:50.600 --> 06:52.120]  You did. You totally did.
[06:52.320 --> 06:53.620]  You hadn't realized the address was wrong.
[06:53.820 --> 06:55.480]  No, I hadn't realized it was wrong yet.
[06:55.560 --> 07:00.680]  So later when you see that, you will know later that night the pieces come together.
[07:01.800 --> 07:02.900]  That's very fucking funny.
[07:03.840 --> 07:06.360]  Did you then try to resend it or did you just give up on the bit?
[07:06.480 --> 07:07.900]  I don't have their address.
[07:07.980 --> 07:09.480]  Like I looked and I clearly...
[07:10.120 --> 07:13.620]  Yeah, like and I can't ask anyone involved because then it tips my hand.
[07:13.620 --> 07:14.920]  So yeah, it's dead.
[07:15.260 --> 07:16.120]  Oh, that's such a shame.
[07:16.760 --> 07:17.780]  Yeah, it was a great idea.
[07:17.980 --> 07:20.500]  How do you how do you like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game?
[07:21.180 --> 07:22.220]  Oh, it's so much fun.
[07:22.540 --> 07:23.540]  I love it. It's great.
[07:23.620 --> 07:25.560]  Those people, they do such...
[07:25.560 --> 07:28.680]  It's the same team that made the Friday the 13th game.
[07:29.080 --> 07:34.360]  And I had never seen a Friday the 13th movie when I played the game and I got really into it.
[07:34.620 --> 07:36.040]  It is such a weird...
[07:36.040 --> 07:42.140]  They do such a great attention to detail and everything that it's such a weird experience watching a movie for the first time.
[07:42.140 --> 07:48.940]  But knowing how the house is laid out, being like, oh, that door to the right leads to a bathroom and upstairs, there's six bedrooms.
[07:49.260 --> 08:00.000]  So I'm having a similar experience with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game where I haven't seen any of those movies, but I'm now really excited to watch them and rehab that experience of like, oh, I know the entire layout of this house.
[08:00.380 --> 08:01.060]  This is so strange.
[08:01.280 --> 08:09.660]  I always feel that way when I watch Clue because we play so many like Gmod murder games in the house that I just know the entire layout of that place in the movie.
[08:09.660 --> 08:12.780]  Like I'm like, oh, it's going to go down under the stairs is the light switch.
[08:12.940 --> 08:13.980]  And then it happens in the movie.
[08:14.040 --> 08:18.600]  It's like, oh, I, uh, I like that game a lot until Starfield came out.
[08:18.960 --> 08:22.920]  And yeah, all apologies to Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
[08:23.060 --> 08:26.940]  I really enjoyed it for about, you know, up until the moment I loaded Starfield.
[08:27.120 --> 08:28.460]  Now, no other video games exist.
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.120]  Oh, except for fucking guess who?
[08:31.360 --> 08:33.740]  Who guess who got another achievement named after him?
[08:34.280 --> 08:36.100]  Oh, I completely forgot.
[08:36.180 --> 08:37.380]  I wasn't even going to talk about that.
[08:37.380 --> 08:41.540]  The lovely gyms of war people gave me a new achievement.
[08:41.700 --> 08:42.760]  How fucking cool is that?
[08:43.320 --> 08:44.020]  What was it?
[08:44.080 --> 08:45.400]  How long is it going to take you to get?
[08:45.740 --> 08:47.280]  Oh, my God. I haven't gotten it yet.
[08:47.920 --> 08:49.840]  But it's called it's so sweet.
[08:49.980 --> 08:54.600]  If like I kind of appreciate if they they at the time, I don't think it ended up being so.
[08:54.700 --> 08:57.100]  But at the time, it was the hardest achievement in the game.
[08:57.160 --> 08:58.080]  They named after me, I think.
[08:59.000 --> 09:00.900]  And if anything, this is the easiest.
[09:01.500 --> 09:03.200]  They it's called Geoff is a legend.
[09:03.320 --> 09:06.500]  And all you have to do is type Geoff is a legend into the global chat.
[09:06.500 --> 09:07.240]  That's great.
[09:07.620 --> 09:08.980]  That is so cool.
[09:09.280 --> 09:10.040]  That's so cool.
[09:10.120 --> 09:11.220]  What lovely people.
[09:11.320 --> 09:12.280]  I can't believe they did that.
[09:12.940 --> 09:14.800]  That's such a weird achievement, too.
[09:14.880 --> 09:17.200]  But that's really I've never seen that done for anyone.
[09:17.520 --> 09:20.500]  Yeah, I've seen like speed running achievements in Halo
[09:20.500 --> 09:22.620]  named after the like original best runners.
[09:22.760 --> 09:26.340]  But and we've had a bunch of we've been you know, we've been fortunate enough
[09:26.340 --> 09:30.020]  to have a bunch of references in in Rooster Teeth throughout the years.
[09:30.020 --> 09:32.100]  Like Gears of War, they named an achievement.
[09:32.240 --> 09:32.880]  Is it a spider?
[09:32.880 --> 09:36.600]  Which is a grenade stick, like which is a reference to early Red vs.
[09:36.720 --> 09:38.120]  Blue. We got a bunch of those type things.
[09:38.180 --> 09:42.080]  But this is like this is so I don't know, just so I'm so humbled
[09:42.080 --> 09:43.320]  and so appreciative of it.
[09:43.380 --> 09:45.900]  It was such a sweet and kind and nice thing to do.
[09:45.960 --> 09:47.460]  And I really I really appreciate it.
[09:47.480 --> 09:48.240]  Awesome people.
[09:48.720 --> 09:49.660]  Yeah, that's really cool.
[09:50.240 --> 09:52.760]  Should we maybe talk about why we're playing games?
[09:52.800 --> 09:54.600]  I mean, outside of there's a bunch of reasons.
[09:54.920 --> 09:56.260]  But one of the things you're doing with games.
[09:56.720 --> 09:59.440]  Yeah. And then after that, I want to pitch you guys on a on a new draft.
[10:00.000 --> 10:01.280]  Oh, I'm excited about this.
[10:01.640 --> 10:02.240]  This is great.
[10:02.720 --> 10:03.600]  Do you want to lean in?
[10:03.720 --> 10:05.100]  How do you want to how do we intro this?
[10:05.220 --> 10:05.980]  How do we set this up?
[10:06.160 --> 10:07.780]  Will this be the first time people are hearing of it?
[10:08.380 --> 10:09.300]  I think so.
[10:09.400 --> 10:13.480]  They got a they got a weird pre-conversation
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.180]  hinting at it last episode that we completely dropped and didn't
[10:17.180 --> 10:18.640]  didn't return to at all.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.360]  I mean, I absolutely intended to end the episode
[10:21.360 --> 10:24.660]  circling back around to that and and put some kind of button on it
[10:24.660 --> 10:25.520]  and completely forgot.
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.800]  So maybe like the best way to do this is my introduction to how this all came to be.
[10:30.160 --> 10:31.940]  Geoff, you fell back in love with games again.
[10:32.560 --> 10:34.140]  Yeah. Super exciting to me.
[10:34.300 --> 10:41.100]  I did. I am a might sound a little bit like a hypocrite at times.
[10:41.440 --> 10:44.680]  I have been done with video games for about six years,
[10:45.360 --> 10:48.620]  and I really thought I was done with video games for about six years.
[10:48.720 --> 10:52.080]  Turns out I just needed about a six year break from them
[10:52.080 --> 10:54.900]  after making them my career for most of my adult life.
[10:55.340 --> 10:58.840]  And quite naturally, some friends of mine that have nothing to do
[10:58.840 --> 11:00.900]  with our podcast or with Rooster Teeth,
[11:01.800 --> 11:03.800]  where they play a lot of Xbox games together.
[11:03.960 --> 11:07.500]  And they they've been inviting me to play games for probably a year.
[11:07.620 --> 11:09.660]  And I had been almost doing it and almost doing it.
[11:09.700 --> 11:12.100]  And one night I just said, fuck it, I'm going to hop on with these dudes
[11:12.100 --> 11:14.700]  and check it out and had so much fun.
[11:15.040 --> 11:17.220]  And then I have literally I think we've mentioned it,
[11:17.220 --> 11:19.500]  but I've literally been playing video games from about 10 p.m.
[11:19.500 --> 11:20.720]  until 3 a.m. every night
[11:22.960 --> 11:26.420]  for over a month now, playing a lot of Battlefield and stuff.
[11:26.420 --> 11:29.760]  And I have realized that I have completely and totally fallen in love
[11:29.760 --> 11:30.480]  with video games again.
[11:30.520 --> 11:32.880]  I think I just needed a really extensive break.
[11:33.420 --> 11:37.100]  And that changed how I feel about certain things.
[11:37.760 --> 11:39.620]  I like the idea of you playing till 3 a.m.
[11:39.660 --> 11:42.920]  because I used to do that Halo 2 when I was a teenager.
[11:43.160 --> 11:44.960]  And my parents would always be like, shut up, go to bed.
[11:45.040 --> 11:46.580]  I just love the idea of you doing it.
[11:46.640 --> 11:48.360]  But it's your own door to go. Shut up.
[11:48.960 --> 11:52.040]  Oh, totally. Last night, Millie came in about 11 o'clock
[11:52.040 --> 11:52.920]  and was like, you need to go to bed.
[11:53.280 --> 11:54.260]  You have to work for a fucking fix tomorrow.
[11:54.380 --> 11:55.660]  And I was like, I know, I know, I know. You're right.
[11:56.800 --> 11:58.720]  She's keeping you sane.
[11:59.920 --> 12:03.140]  I made an agreement with myself that I wouldn't play late on nights
[12:03.140 --> 12:04.780]  that I have to, nights before fuckface.
[12:05.000 --> 12:05.520]  Well, it's a school night.
[12:06.060 --> 12:07.400]  Yeah, it's the only school night.
[12:07.460 --> 12:09.600]  Like, I don't care about Anma or my podcast or anything else,
[12:09.640 --> 12:12.280]  but I do care about this one in terms of, like, getting a good night's sleep.
[12:12.680 --> 12:13.080]  Thanks, man.
[12:15.660 --> 12:16.300]  You're welcome.
[12:17.620 --> 12:20.460]  I just say like this, I just mean that this one requires more.
[12:21.680 --> 12:23.800]  I don't know, mental acuity and effort from me.
[12:23.880 --> 12:25.100]  I need I need a good night's sleep for it.
[12:26.120 --> 12:27.220]  But but it's hard.
[12:27.360 --> 12:28.700]  It's hard to say no when Starfield's out.
[12:28.980 --> 12:30.400]  It's also a hilarious.
[12:30.620 --> 12:33.860]  It was a sliding scale where we recorded an episode
[12:33.860 --> 12:38.000]  and you were very down about you didn't like how you performed in that episode
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.940]  and then declared that no more games on a school night, as you called it.
[12:42.120 --> 12:44.740]  And then the next episode we asked, well, did you not play games?
[12:44.800 --> 12:46.440]  You said, no, I only played till 2 a.m.
[12:46.700 --> 12:48.040]  I lowered it a little bit.
[12:48.060 --> 12:49.620]  Like you immediately went back.
[12:50.000 --> 12:50.820]  You can't stop.
[12:51.100 --> 12:52.420]  Last night I stopped at 1245.
[12:53.540 --> 12:55.160]  Wow. It is an early night.
[12:55.160 --> 12:56.040]  Pretty early. Yeah.
[12:56.280 --> 12:57.700]  So I got a good six hours of sleep last night.
[12:57.740 --> 12:58.520]  I felt pretty good about that.
[12:59.100 --> 13:00.340]  So you're back into games.
[13:00.580 --> 13:04.500]  Gaming has been like my number one hobby this entire time.
[13:04.860 --> 13:08.260]  I just completely understood where you guys are coming from
[13:08.260 --> 13:10.320]  with making content in the past relating to it.
[13:10.480 --> 13:14.120]  It's like I don't even when when you guys were doing that, it felt weird to be like,
[13:14.200 --> 13:16.500]  hey, you just spent nine hours playing games.
[13:16.600 --> 13:20.400]  Do you want to stop and then come home and then play more games with me?
[13:20.480 --> 13:20.880]  I did not.
[13:20.940 --> 13:24.140]  So it's like always a tough thing of like trying to find time for that
[13:24.140 --> 13:25.060]  without feeling bad.
[13:25.520 --> 13:26.980]  But this this break has changed.
[13:27.700 --> 13:30.460]  And then I guess, Eric, maybe you can can interject with
[13:30.460 --> 13:32.440]  with how this all shook out.
[13:32.800 --> 13:36.480]  Yeah, just had some meetings internally about, hey,
[13:36.520 --> 13:37.740]  what are we trying to do with this?
[13:37.780 --> 13:39.180]  And we have some space here.
[13:40.400 --> 13:44.260]  Approached Geoff first with the proposition of, hey,
[13:44.300 --> 13:49.260]  would you guys want to do some gaming videos on the Let's Play channel?
[13:50.100 --> 13:53.940]  And Geoff immediately, I think we were in an office
[13:53.940 --> 13:56.920]  and the first thing you said to me was, yeah, I made the channel.
[13:57.020 --> 13:59.200]  Give it back to me. Absolutely. Yeah, let's do this.
[14:02.180 --> 14:05.400]  Because we had talked about if you go back and listen to the first sausage talk,
[14:05.420 --> 14:06.280]  I think it's the first one.
[14:06.740 --> 14:09.040]  I was very adamant against.
[14:10.240 --> 14:13.180]  Us playing games sporadically,
[14:14.560 --> 14:17.820]  but when this was brought to us and they said, hey,
[14:17.820 --> 14:21.380]  would you want to do something on the regular for some gameplay stuff
[14:21.380 --> 14:23.460]  where it wouldn't have to be all of you? Right.
[14:23.460 --> 14:27.820]  You can break out into like smaller pairings and things like that.
[14:27.820 --> 14:30.140]  And but putting these videos out of game plays.
[14:31.020 --> 14:35.340]  I felt like it was a good opportunity for us to do video game stuff,
[14:35.420 --> 14:37.180]  especially with Geoff getting back into it.
[14:37.280 --> 14:40.780]  And so every Friday
[14:41.720 --> 14:44.120]  on the Let's Play channel,
[14:44.640 --> 14:48.820]  there will be a new face regulation gameplay.
[14:49.740 --> 14:53.160]  And then every Monday on Rooster Teeth first,
[14:53.160 --> 14:58.060]  you'll get an additional face regulation gameplay, which is just more.
[14:58.180 --> 14:59.540]  It's it's not the same game.
[14:59.620 --> 15:00.560]  It's just a different video.
[15:00.700 --> 15:03.840]  But it's more gameplay if you want to go check it out over there.
[15:03.840 --> 15:08.180]  But we're going to be doing some gaming stuff on the Let's Play channel, right?
[15:09.520 --> 15:11.320]  Yeah, I'm excited about it.
[15:12.500 --> 15:15.800]  I'm I'm really, really, really jazzed about it.
[15:16.260 --> 15:20.740]  I really didn't think that we well, first off, you know, there had been
[15:20.740 --> 15:23.380]  there have been obvious opportunities for us
[15:23.380 --> 15:26.760]  to do some gaming related content in face that made sense.
[15:27.560 --> 15:31.680]  Gavin and Andrew having their Halo speed run race in.
[15:31.820 --> 15:32.780]  Yeah. In Halo two or whatever.
[15:32.840 --> 15:36.960]  And the time that we we all ended up playing Warzone together
[15:36.960 --> 15:39.080]  and we just laughed and laughed and laughed, talked about hanging out
[15:39.080 --> 15:40.680]  in the bathroom and it turned into funny content.
[15:41.380 --> 15:43.840]  And there have been a few other there have been a few other moments
[15:43.840 --> 15:45.820]  and races and bets between y'all and stuff.
[15:46.020 --> 15:50.160]  And the problem was we didn't want to put gameplay on the face.
[15:50.160 --> 15:55.060]  YouTube channel, because it it's not good to mix podcasts
[15:55.060 --> 15:56.500]  and gameplay on the same channel.
[15:57.060 --> 16:00.660]  It's it's also not super good to mix super short and super long videos
[16:00.660 --> 16:01.700]  on the same channel, so it didn't really.
[16:02.080 --> 16:05.800]  So it may not have been the smartest thing to put the animations on the channel.
[16:05.840 --> 16:07.120]  But we thought that made sense.
[16:07.300 --> 16:09.960]  But I just don't want to confuse the audience with the idea
[16:09.960 --> 16:13.940]  that there would be gameplay on the face main channel.
[16:14.020 --> 16:18.520]  So when the Let's Play channel came up for grabs, it just kind of made sense to me.
[16:18.520 --> 16:22.140]  It's it's not a brand per se, even though I tried desperately
[16:22.140 --> 16:25.060]  to turn it into one for a few years there.
[16:25.100 --> 16:26.820]  And I don't think I quite succeeded.
[16:28.080 --> 16:30.600]  But it is more like a distribution channel.
[16:30.640 --> 16:34.880]  And it just kind of makes sense since Gavin and I are already in
[16:34.880 --> 16:37.960]  probably 70% of the videos on that channel.
[16:38.580 --> 16:41.900]  I guess if you don't come to face the rooster teeth and you're not familiar
[16:41.900 --> 16:46.380]  with what with how we got here, Gavin and I worked in a department
[16:46.380 --> 16:49.040]  in Rooster Teeth called Achievement Hunter for 12 years or so.
[16:49.320 --> 16:53.580]  And we made over 10,000 gaming videos, made so many that I swore I'd never do it again.
[16:55.360 --> 16:56.840]  But but here we are.
[16:56.920 --> 17:02.300]  And I got to say, Andrew, how many how many videos have we recorded to this moment?
[17:04.260 --> 17:09.140]  Uh, between 16 or 18 videos, not everyone and everyone.
[17:09.280 --> 17:11.560]  But yeah, there have been 16 or 18 videos made at this point.
[17:11.600 --> 17:15.420]  It's really weird, too, because we all get together for some like big main videos.
[17:15.420 --> 17:19.200]  But then I feel like Andrew just goes apeshit in between making videos
[17:19.200 --> 17:23.420]  with individual people like Geoff on his own, me on my own, Nick.
[17:24.080 --> 17:27.380]  Well, it's just it allows for me to interact like I've never interacted
[17:27.380 --> 17:31.280]  with Nick outside of the show, like we've been meaning to play games just socially.
[17:31.440 --> 17:33.220]  But it's just one of those things that didn't come together.
[17:33.520 --> 17:37.160]  So it's exciting to me to explore different aspects of Face
[17:37.160 --> 17:39.200]  outside of Face as well.
[17:39.360 --> 17:41.780]  Like Nick, the whole thing with me wanting to make videos.
[17:41.840 --> 17:45.160]  So Nick started with I think I am easily the weirdest person here.
[17:45.420 --> 17:46.900]  And Nick is the most normal.
[17:47.220 --> 17:49.720]  And my goal is through direct interaction with Nick.
[17:49.900 --> 17:54.500]  I could either expose weirdness or make him more weird either way.
[17:54.780 --> 17:58.300]  Yeah, I think based on the ones I've done with you, they're not normal.
[17:58.700 --> 18:02.560]  No, no, they're they're real weird.
[18:03.140 --> 18:06.220]  These are definitely these are definitely regulation gameplay videos.
[18:06.380 --> 18:09.000]  They're they're definitely of face for sure.
[18:10.160 --> 18:13.660]  Yeah. And let me say from the outset, I don't think this has been
[18:14.780 --> 18:18.380]  expressly stated between any of us, but it definitely feels to me like,
[18:18.700 --> 18:22.240]  Andrew, you have taken the creative reins and you're kind of the brain behind
[18:22.760 --> 18:25.820]  the direction we're going with all these videos like you've you've
[18:25.820 --> 18:29.300]  you and I've done some brainstorming and I've pitched a couple of ideas.
[18:29.400 --> 18:31.180]  But I think most of the good stuff has come from you
[18:31.180 --> 18:32.620]  and you seem to really be spearheading it.
[18:32.700 --> 18:36.820]  So thank you for all of your effort over the last three weeks.
[18:37.020 --> 18:39.800]  One really nice thing about it is Gavin goes out of town a lot
[18:39.800 --> 18:42.320]  and Gavin goes out of town face shuts down.
[18:42.540 --> 18:45.800]  But now Andrew and I were able to record like four videos
[18:45.800 --> 18:47.400]  while Gavin's out of town, which is insane.
[18:48.100 --> 18:52.300]  Well, this has been like the content that you guys made with the treatment hunter.
[18:52.600 --> 18:55.740]  I loved so much as somebody who started through the community.
[18:56.000 --> 18:57.080]  It meant so much to me.
[18:57.180 --> 18:59.840]  And then becoming friends with you guys, like it was always
[18:59.840 --> 19:02.820]  I don't think I'd have any interest in making content at all
[19:02.820 --> 19:04.480]  if it wasn't for the content that you made.
[19:04.700 --> 19:08.940]  So now in this weird way of this was something I assumed
[19:08.940 --> 19:12.480]  that we would never do, especially if you, Geoff, not being interested
[19:12.480 --> 19:17.500]  in games for so long, having a really natural return to this point.
[19:17.640 --> 19:20.820]  It has been so exciting to me to get to make these videos
[19:20.820 --> 19:24.920]  because it was a dream for a long time that I just I assumed would never happen.
[19:24.940 --> 19:25.720]  So I let go of.
[19:25.820 --> 19:28.680]  So now it's just been so much fun and it means so much to me
[19:28.680 --> 19:33.100]  to be able to make content on this channel that I think we would all agree.
[19:33.220 --> 19:37.320]  It's been an absolute joy making everything we have made so far.
[19:37.320 --> 19:39.380]  It has been I've had so much fun.
[19:39.400 --> 19:41.700]  I feel like that's a really nice thing to hear.
[19:41.760 --> 19:42.500]  And also, you're an idiot.
[19:42.620 --> 19:44.720]  You could have been in those videos, whatever you wanted the whole time.
[19:45.340 --> 19:49.260]  Yeah, that's we flew you all the way down to Texas just to put you in videos.
[19:49.380 --> 19:50.240]  We were desperate to get you.
[19:50.520 --> 19:55.080]  OK, so one, I don't think that I was in a position at that time
[19:55.080 --> 19:58.020]  to do that to the level in which I'd want to or perform the way
[19:58.020 --> 20:00.120]  I think most of those videos I'm in, I'm terrible.
[20:00.280 --> 20:01.620]  And there's one I'm OK with.
[20:01.620 --> 20:04.020]  But like 90 percent of them. Yeah, but awful.
[20:04.140 --> 20:05.500]  But Andrew sucks in the beginning.
[20:05.500 --> 20:08.100]  Yeah, I was about to say, Andrew, I feel that way about 90 percent of the videos
[20:08.100 --> 20:10.120]  Gavin's in. That's
[20:11.460 --> 20:13.620]  I'm not substantial to say that's fair.
[20:13.740 --> 20:14.800]  I apologize, Gavin.
[20:14.960 --> 20:17.580]  I was I was not really not.
[20:17.720 --> 20:20.380]  That was an 80, but that was one hell of a curve on that pitch.
[20:20.420 --> 20:22.620]  But yeah, I did not see that coming.
[20:24.720 --> 20:26.520]  I don't know what else is going to.
[20:26.700 --> 20:28.900]  Well, just it's like we lived in a different world then, too.
[20:28.940 --> 20:30.780]  Like I can't work in America.
[20:31.160 --> 20:33.680]  There wasn't an idea of like doing these remotely.
[20:33.680 --> 20:35.340]  Like that was not a consideration.
[20:35.580 --> 20:40.120]  So it was just plus on top of the fact that I love you guys as people.
[20:40.740 --> 20:45.020]  And that is doing stuff back at Achievement Hunter at that time was the dream
[20:45.020 --> 20:46.140]  of so many.
[20:46.380 --> 20:50.540]  And I was always so scared of tainting the well in the sense of
[20:50.540 --> 20:54.780]  I imagine it must be so difficult in your position to judge people
[20:54.780 --> 20:59.340]  that are in that space that they do not want something from you in any capacity,
[20:59.380 --> 21:02.780]  that the friendship is purely based around who you are as people.
[21:02.780 --> 21:06.440]  So I never wanted to push that in any way, even though internally
[21:06.440 --> 21:09.080]  someone who loves video games and love spending time with you guys.
[21:09.500 --> 21:11.300]  Obviously, that would be a thing I'd love to do.
[21:11.720 --> 21:14.980]  So now having this come up in a way that is so natural and I think makes sense
[21:14.980 --> 21:16.820]  for us, it has just been so much fun.
[21:17.380 --> 21:20.020]  Yeah, I've been asked about, you know, several things to do with it.
[21:20.040 --> 21:23.660]  And I just my answer is always I don't really care where it is or what it's called,
[21:23.760 --> 21:26.760]  but I just want to make funny videos with my friends.
[21:26.920 --> 21:30.760]  Yeah, it's pretty much my core goal, I think, just in general.
[21:30.760 --> 21:34.560]  I think a big thing with this, too, and the reason why we said yes to it
[21:34.560 --> 21:38.660]  and everything now it gets so profound or whatever is talking with Geoff about this.
[21:39.040 --> 21:42.980]  Probably over a year ago, Geoff said, I want to be doing face every day.
[21:43.060 --> 21:46.040]  How do we do that? And this is how we do that.
[21:46.160 --> 21:49.740]  It is. And I talked to Andrew about it earlier today. We're not.
[21:50.660 --> 21:56.220]  I think keeping the podcast, the podcast and how raucous it is
[21:56.220 --> 21:57.760]  and everything is like really important.
[21:57.760 --> 22:02.140]  And if we do more right, you're spreading or whatever.
[22:02.440 --> 22:06.740]  But doing like these gameplay things has the core of like what really works here
[22:06.740 --> 22:08.280]  and what's so much fun about this show.
[22:08.400 --> 22:12.760]  But it's not always all of us the whole time, but sometimes it is.
[22:12.920 --> 22:15.860]  And it's fun either way.
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  So hopefully everyone will go check it out, because I do think that the stuff that Geoff
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.600]  and Andrew have explained that they've recorded in Warzone is so
[22:26.060 --> 22:30.840]  is so fucking funny to me that I cannot wait to watch it.
[22:31.220 --> 22:34.500]  We have recorded in the last month
[22:34.500 --> 22:37.500]  since this was a thing that we've known about, like kind of internally.
[22:37.520 --> 22:42.920]  We've recorded like 12 videos because we can't wait to do this stuff.
[22:43.120 --> 22:47.000]  Yeah, we're like so excited and just turning stuff in every day.
[22:47.560 --> 22:50.680]  I can't. October 6th will be the first one.
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.880]  That will be the first video that will go up on the Let's Play channel.
[22:54.140 --> 22:55.940]  And then it'll be every Friday and Monday.
[22:56.220 --> 23:00.740]  It'll be Friday for the Let's Play channel on YouTube and on Rooster Teeth
[23:00.740 --> 23:02.760]  and then Rooster Teeth first on Monday.
[23:02.900 --> 23:04.000]  So that's important to know.
[23:04.500 --> 23:08.880]  And that'll be the release schedule going forward for now.
[23:09.120 --> 23:11.740]  But I reserve the right to fuck with that at any point.
[23:11.780 --> 23:13.360]  Yeah. To add in content or whatever.
[23:13.420 --> 23:14.320]  There's no reason for us to.
[23:14.580 --> 23:15.400]  We've been excited.
[23:15.580 --> 23:17.900]  So we've been generating a ton of content.
[23:18.060 --> 23:20.720]  A lot of it just because you want to find your voice before you launch.
[23:20.720 --> 23:22.620]  And then that allows you a little bit of flexibility
[23:22.620 --> 23:25.500]  if you have a couple that you don't think meet the standards.
[23:25.620 --> 23:27.180]  You can jettison them, get rid of them or whatever.
[23:27.420 --> 23:28.580]  I just I like that.
[23:28.680 --> 23:30.180]  It's like my like the So Alright podcast.
[23:30.300 --> 23:32.460]  I think I'd recorded eight of them before the first episode came out
[23:32.460 --> 23:35.480]  because it's just it's just the way I like to do things when at all possible.
[23:35.840 --> 23:38.800]  But I don't see any reason to hold on to a bunch of episodes
[23:38.800 --> 23:40.900]  just to slowly trickle them out either.
[23:41.420 --> 23:43.780]  I know I know in particular Gavin fucking hate.
[23:43.860 --> 23:45.340]  That's a pet peeve of Gavin's.
[23:45.340 --> 23:47.000]  And so and I agree with him.
[23:47.040 --> 23:49.840]  And so we'll put out videos as videos make sense.
[23:49.840 --> 23:53.960]  But one thing I would like to elucidate on,
[23:54.160 --> 23:57.020]  I think, is that the one the one concern, if I were
[23:57.640 --> 24:01.220]  maybe a regulation listener or a comment leaver that I would have is
[24:01.220 --> 24:04.220]  does this dilute f*** face? Are they doing too much?
[24:04.380 --> 24:06.560]  Does this f*** face every day too much?
[24:06.900 --> 24:09.860]  And to that, I would say it's something that I was concerned about
[24:09.860 --> 24:12.640]  and why we had those conversations over a year ago
[24:12.640 --> 24:15.080]  about what something like this could even look like down the road.
[24:15.380 --> 24:18.800]  It's why Sausage Talk episode one came out and then episode two didn't come out
[24:18.800 --> 24:22.120]  for, I don't know, months and months and months because it didn't make sense
[24:22.120 --> 24:25.280]  or it wasn't right or we didn't want to rush it or we didn't want to push it.
[24:25.520 --> 24:29.940]  I feel like we've been slowly building up to more content
[24:29.940 --> 24:33.580]  throughout the week, very intentionally, but as it makes sense
[24:33.580 --> 24:37.200]  over the last three years to make sure that we can maintain the level of quality,
[24:37.360 --> 24:41.860]  to make sure that we have enough juice in the comedy tanks to support it.
[24:42.260 --> 24:45.920]  And so this feels like a very from the production side,
[24:45.920 --> 24:48.000]  from the from the work side on our end.
[24:48.140 --> 24:52.040]  This feels like a very natural transition into more content.
[24:52.200 --> 24:54.720]  It doesn't feel like we went from making one podcast a week
[24:54.720 --> 24:56.240]  to suddenly we're making five or six things a week.
[24:56.360 --> 24:59.180]  And you have to worry about us diluting the quality of any of it.
[24:59.240 --> 25:03.240]  This is something that we've been we've been building up a callous and stamina.
[25:03.600 --> 25:06.240]  And so I feel really good about that.
[25:06.460 --> 25:10.240]  When like three years into the podcast, I've I'm still gagging for more
[25:10.240 --> 25:11.760]  face in between recordings.
[25:11.760 --> 25:14.460]  And I think that's why Andrew and I play video games so often.
[25:14.460 --> 25:18.380]  It's just because I feel like there's definitely more to there's more to give.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.940]  It's also a thing with the let's play side of what we're doing,
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.800]  where it's the same energy of what we have here.
[25:23.900 --> 25:26.600]  But the game is like really guiding things as well.
[25:26.720 --> 25:30.660]  Like I don't prep in the same way I do for a podcast as I do a let's play.
[25:30.800 --> 25:34.700]  So much of it is what the experience of what we go through during that time
[25:34.700 --> 25:37.480]  kind of reacting to it and unfolds for us.
[25:37.840 --> 25:41.720]  Like I'm I'm starting my perspective of let's plays when we start a video.
[25:41.720 --> 25:45.600]  I'm doing it because I really want to spend time with whoever is in the video.
[25:46.140 --> 25:47.380]  Like I enjoy all you guys.
[25:47.460 --> 25:49.840]  And then the content, I think, is largely dictated
[25:49.840 --> 25:52.940]  by what is happening in that video game, which is something
[25:52.940 --> 25:55.120]  that would never happen on the podcast like that.
[25:55.360 --> 25:58.020]  Just the conversations and where things spin.
[25:58.200 --> 26:01.580]  I mean, we did a video last night where you just watched me play Starfield for a bit.
[26:02.160 --> 26:05.320]  Yeah. And I played like a bit of a lunatic.
[26:06.980 --> 26:09.840]  Which, Andrew, it's it's interesting to hear your approach to it,
[26:09.840 --> 26:12.740]  because I actually have kind of the opposite approach,
[26:12.960 --> 26:15.540]  where that is kind of how I used to treat
[26:16.020 --> 26:19.280]  gameplay videos back in the old days when that's all we cranked out.
[26:19.600 --> 26:22.580]  And now I have I've learned through F*** Face
[26:23.500 --> 26:25.540]  how to prepare and how to.
[26:26.540 --> 26:30.700]  I've learned, I guess, a rhythm of the way I like to produce content now.
[26:30.900 --> 26:35.200]  And so I I've been writing down bits and getting prepared for the gameplays
[26:35.200 --> 26:39.400]  much in much the same way I do for F*** Face, because that's why
[26:40.080 --> 26:42.160]  I because that's just how I like to operate now.
[26:42.460 --> 26:44.660]  So like I've been doing there's like one bit I've been doing.
[26:44.820 --> 26:46.620]  I think I did it in both Worms videos
[26:46.620 --> 26:49.860]  we recorded where I start off the video with a little thing.
[26:49.940 --> 26:53.020]  And I've been I've been approaching each let's play that we do
[26:53.020 --> 26:54.960]  as long as I know about it going into an event.
[26:55.020 --> 26:57.900]  Sometimes you surprise me with one, which is also awesome.
[26:58.040 --> 27:00.460]  But I've been I've been trying to kind of go the opposite route
[27:00.460 --> 27:03.600]  and prepare things for the episodes, kind of like I do for the podcast.
[27:04.300 --> 27:06.040]  I feel like they're all quite meaningful, too.
[27:06.080 --> 27:08.500]  Like we're not we don't seem to be playing just any old crap.
[27:08.500 --> 27:11.280]  It's like stuff we're currently playing or talking about or like
[27:11.280 --> 27:13.920]  I assume we'll do the the thumb sticks over there and all that.
[27:14.100 --> 27:18.280]  Yeah, that's sort of why that kind of quietly went away is I had an idea for
[27:18.280 --> 27:20.360]  no one's learning about this opportunity.
[27:20.540 --> 27:23.480]  I feel like it just makes more sense to do it in that format.
[27:23.740 --> 27:28.560]  So there is a concept that Gavin and I are finalizing for how that will proceed.
[27:29.980 --> 27:32.880]  So I guess to button all this up and get back to comedy,
[27:33.880 --> 27:37.220]  October 6th on the YouTube Let's Play channel and the Rooster Teeth
[27:37.220 --> 27:39.820]  Let's Play channel on the site and app.
[27:40.440 --> 27:45.060]  Check out episode one of I don't know what regulation gameplay it is.
[27:45.380 --> 27:50.120]  It's us playing Worms WMD, and it might be.
[27:51.100 --> 27:54.320]  The audience, it means nothing when I say something is the best or the worst,
[27:54.340 --> 27:57.240]  because I've said it so many times, but I can genuinely say
[27:57.240 --> 28:00.240]  it's the most I've laughed in a very, very, very long time.
[28:00.540 --> 28:02.140]  It's an insane game of worms.
[28:02.480 --> 28:07.040]  It was so crazy that I showed my partner just the raw video of it
[28:07.040 --> 28:09.740]  to be like, you need to see how this came to end.
[28:09.960 --> 28:10.940]  It is an insane.
[28:11.280 --> 28:14.520]  I don't think I've ever seen a worms game end in that way.
[28:14.900 --> 28:16.620]  And for it to be our first was fantastic.
[28:17.740 --> 28:19.780]  So thanks for listening to sausage talk.
[28:22.040 --> 28:25.280]  Well, I wanted I wanted to get through that because we did the worms
[28:25.280 --> 28:26.860]  and you were on your account, right, Gavin?
[28:26.900 --> 28:28.520]  You're able to play. No problem. What?
[28:29.560 --> 28:30.640]  On the worms account?
[28:31.940 --> 28:33.800]  I just couldn't join worms.
[28:34.620 --> 28:38.460]  Well, the one thing the one thing that's always fucking present,
[28:38.460 --> 28:41.180]  no matter how how you do it or how long it's been,
[28:41.180 --> 28:45.000]  technical problems are always there waiting for you.
[28:45.280 --> 28:48.600]  God, I remember being so thankful to gut my office
[28:48.600 --> 28:52.180]  of all the pandemic recording set up crap like pull out
[28:52.180 --> 28:55.440]  because I had like two PCs and everything was all all over the place.
[28:55.540 --> 28:57.640]  I remember being so happy when we could go back to work
[28:57.640 --> 28:59.640]  and just throw it all that shit in a corner.
[28:59.740 --> 29:02.660]  And it was kind of sad to like get it all back out, actually.
[29:02.660 --> 29:06.540]  And then remember all of the ways I have to wrestle all that equipment
[29:06.540 --> 29:07.300]  to make it work.
[29:07.700 --> 29:09.100]  I just need to buy new stuff.
[29:09.220 --> 29:11.040]  I I fricking hate that setup.
[29:11.340 --> 29:14.780]  I had the opposite problem where right at the pandemic I bought
[29:14.780 --> 29:18.400]  and had Alfredo come over and help me set up a whole capture station.
[29:19.040 --> 29:22.000]  And then I didn't end up doing any more gameplay from that point on.
[29:22.060 --> 29:23.160]  And so it never got used.
[29:23.320 --> 29:26.960]  So it's been sitting here for three three years next to my recording.
[29:27.160 --> 29:32.360]  My my face audio computer just gathering dust and waiting to be used.
[29:32.660 --> 29:34.900]  Do you think we'll get thumb cam over there on that channel?
[29:35.900 --> 29:36.740]  I don't know.
[29:36.960 --> 29:38.740]  Yeah, get the Eric card.

[31:14.110 --> 31:18.250]  There are quite a few times I have in life where I just find it really tough
[31:18.250 --> 31:19.350]  to shut my brain down,
[31:20.710 --> 31:22.090]  especially when I try to sleep.
[31:22.210 --> 31:24.870]  It's almost like an anxiety thing of, oh, man, I have to get up
[31:24.870 --> 31:27.190]  at this specific time and having rest would be great.
[31:27.510 --> 31:32.150]  Therefore, let my brain have every thought I could possibly have run through it.
[31:32.370 --> 31:34.950]  And it's it's a massive annoyance.
[31:34.950 --> 31:38.250]  It turns out one great way to make those racing thoughts go away
[31:38.250 --> 31:39.210]  is to talk them through.

[31:43.010 --> 31:46.390]  thought cycles and find some mental and emotional peace.

[31:52.230 --> 31:55.650]  Talking to someone about all sorts of various issues
[31:55.650 --> 32:00.150]  I have found has led to solutions in my experience
[32:00.670 --> 32:03.390]  and has gotten me to places that I don't think I would have ever
[32:03.390 --> 32:05.150]  naturally gotten to by myself.
[32:05.810 --> 32:09.150]  So I would highly recommend going through that process.

[34:02.890 --> 34:04.870]  But you're banned from Worms, right, Gavin?
[34:04.890 --> 34:06.170]  You can't play Worms.
[34:06.190 --> 34:08.290]  Yeah, there's no there's no notification. I'm banned.
[34:08.630 --> 34:10.730]  It just doesn't connect me to an Xbox Live lobby.
[34:10.830 --> 34:12.550]  And then if I switch to a different account, it works fine.
[34:12.730 --> 34:13.430]  But I don't understand.
[34:13.510 --> 34:16.310]  There's like there's like a team named after you and you can't play.
[34:17.250 --> 34:19.470]  You did voices for the game and you can't play.
[34:19.790 --> 34:23.650]  Yeah, I think I must have tried to sneak anus and like binge
[34:23.650 --> 34:24.810]  into too many worm names.
[34:24.930 --> 34:28.730]  And they eventually say, maybe if you have too many asterisked names,
[34:28.810 --> 34:30.150]  they'll they just kick you off.
[34:30.190 --> 34:31.230]  I don't know. You hit the threshold.
[34:31.630 --> 34:33.410]  Although you got you guys are getting pretty close.
[34:33.570 --> 34:34.350]  And that was as well.
[34:34.910 --> 34:35.410]  God damn.
[34:36.550 --> 34:39.310]  Didn't expect some things to get censored, but with you being banned,
[34:39.370 --> 34:41.030]  I thought, you know, you're in the game.
[34:41.450 --> 34:43.710]  I want to it was unclear because you just can't connect, right?
[34:43.710 --> 34:45.230]  Like there's no pop up or anything.
[34:45.370 --> 34:46.690]  It just says could not connect error.
[34:46.790 --> 34:48.570]  There was an error connecting to the session or whatever.
[34:49.470 --> 34:50.750]  Yeah, so it's the whole thing.
[34:50.750 --> 34:53.990]  So I decided I wanted to get to the bottom of this thing,
[34:54.010 --> 34:55.510]  try to get you unbanned.
[34:55.970 --> 34:57.510]  So I looked up.
[34:58.250 --> 35:02.850]  I I looked up who made the game and I went to their contact page
[35:02.850 --> 35:04.390]  and they have like a team 17 section.
[35:04.490 --> 35:06.010]  Yeah, team 17. Team 17.
[35:06.250 --> 35:09.110]  And so I sent them an email through their help section.
[35:09.230 --> 35:13.530]  They have like a can't get on or whatever thing.
[35:13.610 --> 35:14.750]  I emailed them about it.
[35:14.990 --> 35:17.670]  Explain the situation that you have you.
[35:17.810 --> 35:20.210]  It appears as though you have been banned and that you cannot play.
[35:20.210 --> 35:21.750]  Are you doing this as you or as me?
[35:22.570 --> 35:25.850]  As me. I did it as you almost like as a representative.
[35:26.170 --> 35:27.330]  It was a very weird email.
[35:27.910 --> 35:28.910]  Yeah, I have a friend.
[35:29.330 --> 35:32.510]  My client appears to be banned from your game.
[35:32.770 --> 35:36.550]  It'd be great if that wasn't the case so that they'd be able to make videos
[35:36.550 --> 35:37.870]  with us in their account.
[35:38.490 --> 35:41.710]  And they replied to that with by asking something like,
[35:42.030 --> 35:43.510]  well, do you know why they would have been banned?
[35:43.670 --> 35:47.050]  And I explained and I kind of anticipated
[35:47.050 --> 35:49.630]  maybe them just coming back with a list of names
[35:49.630 --> 35:53.130]  that you've attempted to get through over the years and me having to just go,
[35:53.290 --> 35:54.270]  OK, you got us.
[35:54.590 --> 35:56.910]  That's yeah, you do. That's understandable.
[35:57.250 --> 35:58.090]  That's fair.
[35:58.250 --> 36:01.070]  But they have been insanely helpful.
[36:01.150 --> 36:02.590]  We've been going back and forth.
[36:02.650 --> 36:03.650]  We had like three emails deep.
[36:03.990 --> 36:07.250]  They escalated it to a different level of their team
[36:07.250 --> 36:08.750]  to try to solve this problem.
[36:08.910 --> 36:13.970]  And I just got an email today saying that on their end,
[36:13.970 --> 36:19.390]  there is nothing that appears to indicate that they're preventing you.
[36:19.710 --> 36:22.610]  And however, it might be a Microsoft issue.
[36:22.790 --> 36:27.670]  So they reached out to Microsoft about it and Microsoft told them
[36:27.670 --> 36:30.590]  that you need to go through this process of posting a link.
[36:31.210 --> 36:33.190]  Go through this process, Gavin.
[36:33.550 --> 36:36.110]  See if there's anything there that says you're banned.
[36:36.290 --> 36:39.730]  And if there there is, then that'll, I guess, explain things.
[36:39.730 --> 36:44.170]  If not, they're asking for screenshots of what your error looks like
[36:44.170 --> 36:46.070]  so we can continue to try to solve this problem.
[36:46.190 --> 36:46.570]  Interesting.
[36:46.690 --> 36:48.950]  So we are we're in the process of getting you unbanned.
[36:49.030 --> 36:50.090]  I have been banned.
[36:50.330 --> 36:53.630]  I have had my Xbox Live name banned before.
[36:54.330 --> 36:56.250]  It was right before the first griffball tournament.
[36:56.930 --> 36:59.430]  I named my griffball team Team Scrotum.
[36:59.670 --> 37:03.250]  And I put that in my in my bio and I was banned
[37:03.250 --> 37:07.270]  from Xbox Live for two days over the griffball tournament.
[37:08.170 --> 37:09.650]  That certainly is past.
[37:09.790 --> 37:11.390]  I'm sure you're in the all clear now.
[37:11.610 --> 37:16.930]  I think I think it's been, oh, 16 years since that ban, so I should be good.
[37:18.330 --> 37:21.730]  I one of my favorite things about playing the backwards compatible
[37:21.730 --> 37:24.330]  through Xbox is that you can look at your rep,
[37:24.490 --> 37:27.350]  which is a system that I don't think they have in the current thing.
[37:27.450 --> 37:30.250]  But on the 360, you could give like thumbs up, thumbs down
[37:30.250 --> 37:32.450]  and you can view your rep and it does a breakdown.
[37:32.770 --> 37:36.250]  And so I viewed it the other day just to see like what it was.
[37:36.250 --> 37:40.950]  And I was like 63 percent avoided
[37:41.490 --> 37:46.010]  and or left bad rep, which is the phrasing is insane.
[37:46.310 --> 37:49.990]  Like it implied that more people voted to not play with me
[37:49.990 --> 37:53.910]  than people that just didn't at all, like just didn't engage in that system.
[37:54.030 --> 37:57.490]  But it must be it's more than voted to play with you again.
[37:58.610 --> 38:00.450]  I yeah, let me I'm next to my Xbox.
[38:00.590 --> 38:04.430]  I could just pull up what it says, but it was an insane
[38:05.070 --> 38:09.030]  an insane thing to read the idea because I would never leave rep on any.
[38:09.230 --> 38:13.650]  So the concept that people would more people in random lobbies
[38:13.650 --> 38:18.030]  decided to leave negative rep against me than people who just didn't at all.
[38:18.230 --> 38:20.410]  I feel like all of that is from Sea of Thieves.
[38:20.950 --> 38:22.170]  This is yeah, it could be.
[38:22.210 --> 38:24.330]  I wonder if like current stuff impacts it.
[38:24.470 --> 38:26.530]  I feel like it's a lot of Halo as well.
[38:26.710 --> 38:29.450]  It tells you what you've done wrong, too, which is great.
[38:29.470 --> 38:31.010]  Oh, like trash talking,
[38:31.010 --> 38:37.130]  um, being obnoxious, griefing, quitting early, like all that type of stuff.
[38:37.230 --> 38:39.810]  So you can see what what you've done in that way.
[38:40.270 --> 38:44.010]  I'll pull up my Xbox criminal record in one moment.
[38:44.150 --> 38:45.510]  It's just loading in 360.
[38:46.090 --> 38:49.450]  Speaking of once we get your setup complete, Andrew, I really want to do
[38:49.450 --> 38:51.810]  some ship of thieves with it.
[38:52.090 --> 38:52.990]  Oh, we need to do Sea of Thieves.
[38:53.150 --> 38:54.230]  Yeah, I'm so excited.
[38:54.450 --> 38:55.870]  Like Tall Tales or something would be so much fun.
[38:56.750 --> 38:57.830]  Oh, it would be great.
[38:57.830 --> 39:02.130]  OK, so in my profile view rep, I am OK.
[39:03.210 --> 39:07.830]  Forty seven percent preferred you or did not submit a review about you.
[39:08.630 --> 39:10.750]  Fifty three percent avoided you.
[39:11.110 --> 39:14.550]  So more than the majority, according to Xbox, decided against me.
[39:14.950 --> 39:18.790]  My details, five percent trash talk where the complaints,
[39:19.310 --> 39:22.890]  two percent language, three percent disruptive.
[39:23.490 --> 39:25.690]  And then there's a behavior category.
[39:25.690 --> 39:27.730]  I'm nine percent aggressive.
[39:28.210 --> 39:30.870]  Thirty four percent unsporting.
[39:31.510 --> 39:33.130]  Fifteen percent quit early.
[39:34.770 --> 39:36.570]  I'm very unsporting, apparently.
[39:36.670 --> 39:38.190]  What is that like, teabagging and stuff?
[39:38.870 --> 39:39.870]  I don't know.
[39:40.210 --> 39:45.090]  I'd love to know, like what the definitions is or are for these different categories.
[39:49.410 --> 39:50.750]  That's I wish I could see.
[39:50.850 --> 39:54.830]  That's so much feedback for what is typically such a passive experience.
[39:55.890 --> 40:00.430]  Maybe that maybe the whole getting people to turn off their Xbox 360
[40:01.290 --> 40:05.010]  convincing them that it was a recon code may have been held against me.
[40:05.310 --> 40:09.070]  But I'm not saying I don't deserve some negative rep,
[40:09.250 --> 40:13.770]  but 47 percent preferred you or did not submit a review is insane.
[40:13.870 --> 40:16.190]  I mean, realistically, the people who you may turn off their Xbox,
[40:16.310 --> 40:17.990]  you should have given them feedback that they quit early.
[40:19.710 --> 40:21.110]  That's true. They hit the wrong button.
[40:21.670 --> 40:22.390]  They weren't paying attention.
[40:22.870 --> 40:24.350]  I'd love to know what your guys rep is.
[40:24.350 --> 40:25.170]  How do I find out?
[40:26.470 --> 40:29.590]  You have to load into your Xbox and load a 360 game
[40:29.950 --> 40:34.050]  and then hit both start buttons and click view profile and then view rep.
[40:34.270 --> 40:36.110]  You can't do it from the app or anything.
[40:36.970 --> 40:39.290]  No, you have to have an Xbox, I think.
[40:40.210 --> 40:40.610]  In front of you.
[40:41.110 --> 40:42.310]  I'm not saying it has to be now.
[40:42.410 --> 40:43.190]  I'm just in the future.
[40:43.290 --> 40:44.610]  I'd love to know what your guys rep is.
[40:45.070 --> 40:46.450]  I'll look it up. I'll look it up eventually.
[40:47.750 --> 40:48.890]  Hey, let me ask you. All right.
[40:48.930 --> 40:49.370]  So here we go.
[40:49.770 --> 40:51.870]  Let's what? OK, here we go.
[40:53.270 --> 40:54.570]  What? Are you all right, man?
[40:54.710 --> 40:56.030]  Yeah, I forgot how I wanted to start this.
[40:56.990 --> 41:00.190]  So I know we're not a fruit podcast anymore,
[41:00.350 --> 41:02.270]  and this isn't really a fruit thing.
[41:02.330 --> 41:03.090]  Yeah, we're veg, right?
[41:03.750 --> 41:06.630]  We're technically veg, but I was I was doing a little postmortem
[41:06.630 --> 41:09.030]  on all of our fruit related content recently.
[41:09.130 --> 41:10.090]  I was pretty happy with it.
[41:10.090 --> 41:11.490]  And I was just kind of thinking about the, you know,
[41:11.870 --> 41:13.510]  ins and outs of it and what worked and what didn't.
[41:14.210 --> 41:17.890]  And I had a thought in my head that I've expanded a little bit
[41:17.890 --> 41:21.210]  that I think may be some sort of a draft
[41:21.210 --> 41:23.670]  or maybe a compilation.
[41:24.130 --> 41:28.030]  I don't know how we would approach it, but I got to thinking about grape
[41:28.030 --> 41:31.590]  and how I just had I just had made myself a peanut butter
[41:31.590 --> 41:32.610]  and jelly sandwich the other day.
[41:32.710 --> 41:35.550]  And grape jelly is so much better than grapes.
[41:36.990 --> 41:41.650]  That got me. OK, I mean, thinking what's the best version of each flavor?
[41:41.850 --> 41:46.550]  So I wrote down I wrote down what I would consider to be
[41:47.790 --> 41:50.670]  regulation flavors, and it's a little bit more than fruit.
[41:50.670 --> 41:52.290]  But let me give you my list and let me know.
[41:52.370 --> 41:55.450]  Let me know if I can if I need to add or subtract anything.
[41:55.450 --> 41:57.390]  If you guys disagree, this is a malleable list.
[41:57.510 --> 41:58.590]  I want to build it with you.
[41:59.410 --> 42:01.430]  Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry,
[42:03.130 --> 42:06.670]  lemon, apple, grape, cherry, banana
[42:06.670 --> 42:11.730]  and cheese are the flavors that I think are most often
[42:13.350 --> 42:15.150]  components in something else that aren't them.
[42:15.430 --> 42:16.830]  Can you give them to me one more time?
[42:17.650 --> 42:20.630]  Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry,
[42:22.510 --> 42:25.770]  lemon, apple, grape, cherry,
[42:27.270 --> 42:28.830]  banana and cheese.
[42:29.410 --> 42:31.650]  I think that's a good. I think it's a very good list.
[42:31.730 --> 42:35.070]  I feel like raspberry being omitted is very interesting.
[42:35.330 --> 42:38.230]  It was on my I was on the fence because it's like if I add raspberry,
[42:38.370 --> 42:40.130]  do I add blueberry, do I add blackberry?
[42:40.210 --> 42:41.810]  It's a whole I already have strawberry.
[42:42.070 --> 42:44.750]  It's like it's it's more popular than the other.
[42:44.750 --> 42:46.710]  Yeah, it's like that flavors.
[42:47.150 --> 42:48.910]  It's the snake eyes of flavors, 100 percent.
[42:49.450 --> 42:51.490]  OK, so we can add or not add it.
[42:51.530 --> 42:53.270]  I just I chose that like I don't know.
[42:53.390 --> 42:56.850]  I like I felt like raspberry is opening up Pandora's box of berries
[42:56.850 --> 42:58.730]  and I just didn't know where to close it.
[42:58.790 --> 43:02.450]  So but like I said, totally happy to add it in or whatever.
[43:02.450 --> 43:05.170]  But it got me thinking, like, what if we got together in some way
[43:05.170 --> 43:10.530]  and everybody presented their like three best vanillas, three best grapes,
[43:10.650 --> 43:11.770]  three best apple flavors?
[43:12.190 --> 43:13.110]  I think it's a great idea.
[43:13.110 --> 43:17.190]  And then we see if we can determine Face's official list of what the best
[43:17.190 --> 43:19.170]  version of each flavor is in the world.
[43:19.550 --> 43:21.230]  I like it. I think that's a great idea.
[43:21.510 --> 43:23.010]  I really like the flavor list.
[43:23.310 --> 43:27.330]  I want to know if internationally that holds up like if if Gavin was like,
[43:27.430 --> 43:30.990]  oh, we don't do cherry like we do this, we do woozles like that.
[43:31.070 --> 43:34.030]  Yeah, I feel like we definitely do more woozle than grape.
[43:35.310 --> 43:40.750]  OK, I feel like like the default jam in this country is grape.
[43:40.750 --> 43:43.090]  But in England, I'd say it was strawberry.
[43:44.790 --> 43:46.990]  Have you ever seen a blue raspberry?
[43:47.370 --> 43:47.490]  Yeah.
[43:47.610 --> 43:47.970]  No.
[43:49.210 --> 43:53.710]  I've never seen one, but I feel like you've eaten a blue raspberry.
[43:54.010 --> 43:55.470]  I've eaten blue raspberry flavor.
[43:56.210 --> 43:57.270]  That's what I'm saying.
[43:57.790 --> 44:01.730]  Like it's I feel like raspberry is so disrespected,
[44:01.750 --> 44:04.610]  it gets turned into a flavor and is not actually a thing.
[44:04.650 --> 44:07.910]  Oh, like there are so many better red things than the raspberry
[44:07.910 --> 44:10.390]  that it gets subjugated to the blue raspberry.
[44:10.390 --> 44:12.130]  And that's absolutely what they do.
[44:12.270 --> 44:13.930]  They go, well, if it's red, it's cherry.
[44:14.370 --> 44:15.930]  So we'll make raspberry blue.
[44:16.310 --> 44:19.110]  And so when you drink this thing, blue is what you associate it to.
[44:19.190 --> 44:21.310]  That's why it's called that specifically.
[44:21.510 --> 44:24.250]  Should we add specifically blue raspberry in then?
[44:24.610 --> 44:25.750]  What? I don't think so.
[44:25.930 --> 44:27.190]  What drops though?
[44:27.330 --> 44:28.910]  Like, I feel like your list is really strong.
[44:29.370 --> 44:30.890]  Oh, I guess I was just going to add it.
[44:30.950 --> 44:31.770]  We don't have to drop anything.
[44:31.930 --> 44:33.830]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[44:33.890 --> 44:35.170]  There's nine things on the list.
[44:35.430 --> 44:36.450]  Oh, then, yeah, it should be 10.
[44:36.970 --> 44:38.110]  All right, we'll do a solid 10.
[44:38.110 --> 44:39.410]  We'll put blue raspberry.
[44:40.110 --> 44:41.470]  And then you just like, you know,
[44:41.550 --> 44:43.370]  and it can be country specific if you want,
[44:43.470 --> 44:44.050]  but it doesn't have to be.
[44:44.110 --> 44:44.990]  I'm just trying to think of like,
[44:45.310 --> 44:47.590]  like when I think of blue raspberry, I think of blow pops.
[44:48.190 --> 44:48.950]  I think of Kool-Aid.
[44:49.770 --> 44:50.130]  Okay.
[44:50.310 --> 44:52.210]  Which I've been drinking a lot of because of you, Geoff.
[44:52.550 --> 44:54.470]  Oh, well, I'm deep in the Kool-Aid trend.
[44:54.490 --> 44:55.290]  Thank you and you're welcome.
[44:55.710 --> 45:00.090]  By the way, people were like blown away that I used two cups of sugar.
[45:00.490 --> 45:03.230]  But what they're missing is I used two cups of sugar
[45:03.230 --> 45:06.630]  with two packets of Kool-Aid and twice the water.
[45:06.630 --> 45:09.430]  Like I just made twice the ratio of Kool-Aid.
[45:09.610 --> 45:10.650]  The ratios were fine.
[45:10.830 --> 45:12.110]  The ratios were identical.
[45:12.810 --> 45:17.450]  I just, instead of like trying to cut the grape and the lemonade packet in half
[45:17.450 --> 45:19.970]  and try to figure out, you know, exactly 50% of each,
[45:19.990 --> 45:21.070]  I just figured I'd double the recipe.
[45:23.310 --> 45:27.950]  Sorry, Gavin just posted his rep right at the end of that.
[45:31.010 --> 45:33.950]  It makes mine so much worse.
[45:34.510 --> 45:38.010]  So mine says 81% preferred you or did not submit review.
[45:38.110 --> 45:39.230]  That feels right.
[45:39.730 --> 45:42.470]  19 avoided, which is crazy because I have a very public game attack.
[45:42.730 --> 45:43.950]  Anyone could mess with it.
[45:44.370 --> 45:48.770]  Trash talk, 5. Language, 2. Disruptive, 0%.
[45:49.230 --> 45:50.990]  Well, you didn't talk for two years.
[45:50.990 --> 45:52.470]  Wait, wait, hang on.
[45:52.670 --> 45:56.070]  Let him keep reading these low, low numbers as he goes down this list.
[45:56.230 --> 45:56.610]  Keep going.
[45:57.650 --> 46:02.370]  Aggressive, 5. Quit early, 7. Unsporting, 62.
[46:06.190 --> 46:10.790]  And that's purely based on what I'm doing in the game.
[46:10.990 --> 46:12.550]  I've never had a mic on.
[46:12.970 --> 46:17.250]  So that's entirely like what my character is doing in the game feedback.
[46:17.410 --> 46:20.090]  It's not that you're being unsporting as a person.
[46:20.270 --> 46:23.430]  It's that your character is being unsporting in the game.
[46:23.710 --> 46:30.170]  But to be fair, that's feedback from only 19%, whereas Andrew's pool is much bigger.
[46:30.170 --> 46:34.250]  That's crazy that mine is so high compared to yours.
[46:34.330 --> 46:37.350]  I was really hoping that it was just like a weird glitch or whatever.
[46:38.830 --> 46:42.210]  That's... that is... for how many games I've played online,
[46:42.610 --> 46:45.110]  it is alarming how high my number is.
[46:46.390 --> 46:48.570]  Oh my God, that makes it so much worse.
[46:48.790 --> 46:50.470]  All right, I'm loading up my explanation.
[46:51.370 --> 46:53.390]  I will say while we're talking about the draft stuff,
[46:53.450 --> 46:55.890]  I saw a lot of people discussing Summer in 98,
[46:56.270 --> 46:58.590]  which we released recently, our rankings for that.
[46:58.890 --> 46:59.330]  I think it's great.
[46:59.350 --> 46:59.610]  The movies?
[46:59.610 --> 47:00.610]  Really good piece of content.
[47:00.730 --> 47:04.470]  Yeah, a lot of talk about us completely omitting Mulan.
[47:04.730 --> 47:06.130]  And I think that's a fair point.
[47:06.270 --> 47:07.770]  I think we may have missed on that one.
[47:07.830 --> 47:08.810]  It's a blind spot.
[47:08.950 --> 47:09.490]  I never saw that.
[47:09.550 --> 47:10.050]  I don't know how.
[47:10.690 --> 47:11.530]  Yeah, neither did I.
[47:11.590 --> 47:12.030]  Never seen it.
[47:12.070 --> 47:13.150]  I think that was just the problem.
[47:13.850 --> 47:15.210]  Banger music, like for sure.
[47:15.290 --> 47:17.370]  I used to on the family channel, get the Stevie Wonder
[47:17.370 --> 47:19.710]  Be True to Your Heart would play all the time.
[47:20.110 --> 47:20.750]  Great music.
[47:20.750 --> 47:22.370]  But I just I feel like we missed it.
[47:22.650 --> 47:26.170]  We just didn't see it, which is the case for a lot of those Disney movies.
[47:26.190 --> 47:27.350]  Like I've never seen Hercules.
[47:27.350 --> 47:30.490]  I just recently watched The Lion King for the first time.
[47:30.910 --> 47:31.410]  The original one?
[47:31.850 --> 47:32.710]  Yeah, the original.
[47:32.970 --> 47:33.170]  Banger.
[47:33.290 --> 47:34.430]  I never watched that as a kid.
[47:34.510 --> 47:38.290]  Yeah, like all of those kind of classic Disney from around that time.
[47:38.410 --> 47:39.070]  I just missed.
[47:40.050 --> 47:43.730]  So essentially, any list we would do, I just don't think I'd consider them.
[47:44.030 --> 47:45.890]  I haven't seen any of the remakes yet.
[47:46.050 --> 47:47.090]  I don't know whether I want to even bother.
[47:47.470 --> 47:49.690]  No, the Jungle Book one was good.
[47:50.310 --> 47:54.590]  But the Mulan was one that I guess I have seen because I've watched all those movies.
[47:54.590 --> 47:56.370]  But it's like, I just don't.
[47:56.390 --> 47:56.770]  I don't know.
[47:56.770 --> 47:59.130]  It didn't stick with me or I didn't finish it.
[47:59.230 --> 47:59.850]  One of the two.
[48:00.270 --> 48:02.090]  Oh, you see, you've gotten your rep.
[48:02.850 --> 48:04.170]  I'm excited to see this.
[48:04.790 --> 48:09.110]  I feel like if you were going to guess, and I don't mean this in an insulting way, Geoff,
[48:09.150 --> 48:13.170]  but I feel like if without context, just guessing who had the worst,
[48:13.470 --> 48:15.230]  I would have guessed yours was the worst.
[48:15.510 --> 48:15.770]  Really?
[48:17.930 --> 48:22.150]  Yeah, just based on not necessarily how you play, but just me knowing you,
[48:22.170 --> 48:24.870]  I'd assume that you got up to the most mischief out of all of us.
[48:25.770 --> 48:27.270]  Well, here's my summary.
[48:31.630 --> 48:36.590]  96% of gamers preferred me or did not submit a review.
[48:36.950 --> 48:38.690]  4% avoided me.
[48:39.670 --> 48:42.110]  Communications, trash talk, zero.
[48:42.870 --> 48:44.370]  Language, 9%.
[48:44.370 --> 48:45.270]  Totally fair.
[48:45.470 --> 48:46.410]  100% fair.
[48:46.530 --> 48:46.990]  That's accurate.
[48:47.570 --> 48:48.850]  Disruptive, zero.
[48:49.370 --> 48:51.470]  Behavior aggressive, zero.
[48:53.670 --> 48:54.550]  Unsporting, 27%.
[48:54.550 --> 48:56.110]  And quit early, 27%.
[48:56.830 --> 48:58.730]  Where's the other like 38% though?
[48:58.930 --> 49:01.270]  What's the maths on that?
[49:04.130 --> 49:05.150]  Yeah, that's weird.
[49:05.270 --> 49:07.110]  I guess none of mine don't add up to 100 either.
[49:07.370 --> 49:08.090]  No, they do not.
[49:08.530 --> 49:09.430]  Hey, can you scroll down?
[49:09.990 --> 49:11.190]  No, let me see.
[49:11.650 --> 49:12.870]  No, no.
[49:13.950 --> 49:15.170]  So I would guess Andrew.
[49:15.230 --> 49:16.670]  I would have guessed Andrew had the worst.
[49:16.670 --> 49:24.610]  I actually, percentage wise, might be less than Gavin.
[49:25.290 --> 49:29.710]  I think if you total up all the numbers, Gavin has a higher percentage than I do.
[49:30.150 --> 49:31.130]  Even though I have more.
[49:33.510 --> 49:39.750]  So my top two equal 10 and then 49, 58.
[49:40.070 --> 49:43.870]  So I have 68 overall, which is essentially just your unsporting.
[49:45.190 --> 49:48.070]  So for all percentages, I'm not as bad as Gavin.
[49:48.270 --> 49:52.070]  How do you have the default Xbox 360 picture?
[49:52.530 --> 49:52.850]  Who, me?
[49:53.150 --> 49:53.410]  Yeah.
[49:54.050 --> 49:55.510]  I don't know why that's there.
[49:55.690 --> 49:56.970]  Oh, you know what it might be?
[49:57.710 --> 50:04.990]  We used to sell gamer pictures for Red vs Blue way, way, way, way, way back in the day.
[50:05.490 --> 50:07.570]  And I probably had a griff one.
[50:07.890 --> 50:10.570]  And I wonder if maybe the licensing ended or wherever.
[50:11.050 --> 50:12.370]  Like, I don't even remember how to...
[50:12.370 --> 50:13.250]  Yeah, I think I had griffball.
[50:13.250 --> 50:17.610]  I don't even know how that system works anymore or where you could go back and find those pictures.
[50:17.890 --> 50:20.270]  Or that was a whole, like, little marketplace that was weird.
[50:20.890 --> 50:23.210]  And it's probably something like that.
[50:23.430 --> 50:26.770]  Like, somewhere, some hard drive wiped all that shit, you know?
[50:27.050 --> 50:28.570]  I can't believe you switched gamer tags.
[50:28.670 --> 50:29.330]  So you have a 14.
[50:30.890 --> 50:33.150]  Yeah, I don't even remember what it used to be.
[50:34.410 --> 50:35.150]  It was something.
[50:35.590 --> 50:40.010]  I will say that as the griffball logo, I never received any royalties on that.
[50:40.590 --> 50:43.370]  That's a big miss on my hat.
[50:44.030 --> 50:45.310]  You should've negotiated better.
[50:45.430 --> 50:46.690]  You should've negotiated like you'd negotiate anger.
[50:46.710 --> 50:47.350]  I really should've.
[50:47.570 --> 50:47.790]  Yeah.
[50:48.270 --> 50:50.930]  Yeah, you'd get 1% in the year 2023, man.
[50:50.990 --> 50:51.330]  Good luck.
[50:52.410 --> 50:59.630]  Hey, so how do you guys want to do this flavor draft or this flavor, I don't know, best of?
[51:00.310 --> 51:01.070]  Should we just...
[51:01.070 --> 51:02.410]  Yeah, I don't know.
[51:02.830 --> 51:05.570]  Just everybody work on it and then we'll schedule it?
[51:05.830 --> 51:07.630]  So what's the format for what we're presenting?
[51:07.750 --> 51:08.290]  Just the flavor?
[51:08.570 --> 51:09.990]  I think we should hammer that out right now.
[51:10.010 --> 51:14.950]  I was going to say, this is going to be the first time we're doing it with a pool,
[51:15.630 --> 51:18.910]  for real, that we have to abide by apparently.
[51:19.570 --> 51:21.970]  So we got to kind of like figure this out.
[51:22.490 --> 51:24.930]  And is the idea to not pick the actual thing though?
[51:25.030 --> 51:27.130]  Like if I'm doing cheese, I can't pick cheese.
[51:27.210 --> 51:28.570]  I have to do like a cheese flavored thing.
[51:28.790 --> 51:32.690]  Right, you'd have to pick like Cheetos or cheese crisps.
[51:33.010 --> 51:34.710]  Oh, I see.
[51:34.850 --> 51:36.130]  I thought we were drafting the flavors.
[51:37.730 --> 51:39.030]  It's flavor, not...
[51:42.050 --> 51:42.930]  Flavored things?
[51:43.450 --> 51:45.490]  Yeah, so like what's the best version of banana?
[51:45.750 --> 51:48.030]  It could be just a banana, but it's not.
[51:48.150 --> 51:49.170]  It's banana flavored runs.
[51:49.550 --> 51:50.230]  But are we...
[51:50.230 --> 51:54.150]  Okay, but are we drafting one for like one?
[51:54.170 --> 51:56.470]  That's why I don't know that it's specifically a draft
[51:56.470 --> 51:59.210]  and might not be more like our music playlist that we built,
[51:59.330 --> 51:59.910]  where we all just...
[51:59.910 --> 52:01.130]  That's what I was about to say.
[52:01.230 --> 52:03.030]  I think the music playlist format works great.
[52:03.030 --> 52:04.710]  But I think that this is...
[52:04.710 --> 52:06.470]  This actually lends itself really interestingly,
[52:06.670 --> 52:07.990]  because if we're doing...
[52:08.550 --> 52:10.690]  If there's 10 flavors to choose from,
[52:11.650 --> 52:14.710]  and we each get five picks,
[52:15.270 --> 52:19.610]  each of your picks can be anything from any of those flavors.
[52:19.990 --> 52:24.410]  So I might pick a blue raspberry Slurpee for my first pick,
[52:24.510 --> 52:26.970]  and then Geoff's first pick might be Doritos, right?
[52:27.050 --> 52:29.570]  Because they're different things, but they're from all the flavors.
[52:29.690 --> 52:30.430]  Does that make sense?
[52:31.050 --> 52:31.330]  Huh?
[52:35.710 --> 52:39.130]  What if we try to make the best meal with these flavors?
[52:39.590 --> 52:40.570]  Is that something?
[52:42.110 --> 52:42.870]  That's interesting.
[52:43.070 --> 52:44.550]  That's a big meal, 10 things.
[52:45.190 --> 52:46.690]  I thought it'd be more along the lines of like,
[52:46.790 --> 52:48.790]  someone says, uh, banana,
[52:49.130 --> 52:50.730]  and then now we have to all pick our best.
[52:51.290 --> 52:52.790]  Right, but then we're picking 10...
[52:52.790 --> 52:55.830]  Like, there's 10 things that we're gonna have to pick.
[52:55.850 --> 52:56.690]  That's like a lot.
[52:58.230 --> 52:58.430]  Yeah.
[52:58.490 --> 52:59.910]  That's a lot of things.
[52:59.910 --> 53:00.590]  What if...
[53:00.590 --> 53:01.390]  There's five of us, there's...
[53:01.390 --> 53:02.150]  How about...
[53:02.150 --> 53:03.550]  50 things that we're gonna choose.
[53:04.050 --> 53:05.010]  How about this?
[53:05.730 --> 53:07.810]  How about we have 10 items,
[53:08.530 --> 53:10.510]  we do through random draft,
[53:10.670 --> 53:12.670]  everybody gets assigned two items,
[53:12.890 --> 53:15.110]  and then you have to come up with the best two,
[53:15.410 --> 53:16.770]  and then we all present those two,
[53:16.930 --> 53:17.830]  and then we have the 10,
[53:17.930 --> 53:19.770]  and that 10 is the definitive list of flavors.
[53:20.350 --> 53:22.550]  The f*** face definitive list of regulation flavors.
[53:22.710 --> 53:26.730]  So you're saying that it's randomly selected which two you get,
[53:26.810 --> 53:28.730]  so you might get banana and cheese,
[53:28.870 --> 53:32.270]  so you are presenting what the best banana and what the best cheese are,
[53:32.270 --> 53:35.090]  and then Gavin gets like blue raspberry and cherry,
[53:35.510 --> 53:37.790]  and so he does the best blue raspberry, best cherry things.
[53:37.950 --> 53:38.470]  Like that's it?
[53:38.610 --> 53:40.050]  Okay, well, that's not...
[53:40.050 --> 53:42.550]  These are supposed to be the regulation flavors, you don't like them?
[53:44.550 --> 53:45.350]  We also...
[53:45.350 --> 53:48.170]  We could do what we did with the Summer 98 movies,
[53:48.310 --> 53:49.590]  where we have the 10 flavors,
[53:49.790 --> 53:52.430]  and then we have to only pick five from that and cut five.
[53:52.490 --> 53:52.870]  Oh, that's interesting.
[53:52.870 --> 53:54.530]  Have debate of what the five will be,
[53:55.010 --> 53:56.970]  and then do a draft off of those five.
[53:56.970 --> 54:00.850]  Especially if Gavin doesn't like two of the 10 that we just listed.
[54:00.850 --> 54:02.390]  I'm not a big flavor guy.
[54:03.990 --> 54:05.470]  What does that mean?
[54:09.490 --> 54:13.890]  Gavin's just gonna draft every flavor of Bubbly as his best flavor for that thing.
[54:16.450 --> 54:18.330]  I like the main thing.
[54:18.490 --> 54:19.310]  Like, I like your strawberry.
[54:19.490 --> 54:19.790]  Love them.
[54:20.210 --> 54:21.030]  Suck them down all day.
[54:21.270 --> 54:22.410]  A strawberry flavor thing?
[54:22.930 --> 54:25.230]  You never had a strawberry shake?
[54:26.210 --> 54:27.690]  What about a strawberry lemonade?
[54:27.690 --> 54:28.430]  Strawberry gum?
[54:29.090 --> 54:29.930]  Nah, I hate all that.
[54:29.930 --> 54:31.650]  You hate strawberry lemonade?
[54:32.110 --> 54:32.250]  Yeah.
[54:32.830 --> 54:33.610]  No, you don't.
[54:33.630 --> 54:34.170]  Oh my god.
[54:34.170 --> 54:34.610]  Nobody hates strawberry lemonade.
[54:34.610 --> 54:36.290]  I don't like lemonade, I like the lemon.
[54:37.270 --> 54:38.810]  God, you're the worst.
[54:40.550 --> 54:43.630]  We're doing a flavor draft with a guy that doesn't like flavor.
[54:44.050 --> 54:46.230]  Well, I like some flavors.
[54:49.590 --> 54:50.030]  I don't...
[54:50.030 --> 54:50.370]  Chalky?
[54:50.450 --> 54:54.110]  As someone who's tasted the flavors that you like, I don't agree.
[54:54.430 --> 54:56.950]  I don't want pickled onion in this list.
[54:56.950 --> 54:57.710]  That's true, yeah.
[54:58.270 --> 55:00.090]  Pickled onion, oh, those Monster Munch.
[55:00.150 --> 55:06.510]  I don't want whatever the fuck those fucking sticks you made us all eat at the chip draft.
[55:06.850 --> 55:09.610]  Whatever that flavor is, I don't want that on the list.
[55:10.330 --> 55:12.210]  It's probably like yeast or something.
[55:13.210 --> 55:16.510]  Twiglets were so bad, I thought you were pulling a prank on us,
[55:16.530 --> 55:19.890]  and I had to ask somebody else from the UK if they knew what they were.
[55:19.890 --> 55:23.270]  There is nothing better than on a cheeky Christmas Eve at your
[55:23.270 --> 55:27.310]  gran's house reaching into what looks like a bird's nest and pulling out a handful of Twiglets.
[55:27.310 --> 55:30.330]  Don't know what a cheeky Christmas Eve is.
[55:30.770 --> 55:32.450]  Like a lovely little Christmas Eve.
[55:32.530 --> 55:33.430]  Here's what we're going to do.
[55:33.550 --> 55:34.730]  Here's how we're going to work this out.
[55:34.850 --> 55:35.130]  Okay.
[55:35.650 --> 55:37.290]  Eric, you might hate this, but I hope not.
[55:37.390 --> 55:37.710]  I know.
[55:37.810 --> 55:40.010]  Hey, whatever, fearless leader, you let me know what we're doing.
[55:40.250 --> 55:40.950]  We're going to...
[55:40.950 --> 55:41.770]  I've decided it.
[55:41.790 --> 55:45.130]  Okay, we're going to come in, we're going to do a drafty type recording.
[55:45.290 --> 55:46.590]  It'll be the definitive list, right?
[55:46.910 --> 55:48.550]  Everybody is going to come prepared.
[55:49.110 --> 55:52.590]  You're going to go home after this podcast or before we record the next one,
[55:52.610 --> 55:56.430]  and you're going to rank these flavors best to worst, one to ten, all right?
[55:57.610 --> 56:00.770]  Then we're all going to take the numbers, we're going to put them together,
[56:00.910 --> 56:03.270]  and we're going to determine the order of the best flavors.
[56:03.430 --> 56:05.870]  So if vanilla is number one, it's number one.
[56:05.930 --> 56:07.590]  Then chocolate, then strawberry, then lemon.
[56:09.710 --> 56:10.950]  Then we're going to do...
[56:11.510 --> 56:13.670]  Yeah, then we're going to take the first five,
[56:14.230 --> 56:18.730]  and we're all going to submit one item that we think is the best version of that flavor.
[56:18.950 --> 56:20.630]  And then we'll have a round-robin discussion.
[56:20.890 --> 56:23.610]  We'll agree, we'll argue, we'll come to some sort of an agreement,
[56:23.610 --> 56:25.810]  and then we'll present the top five flavors.
[56:25.810 --> 56:28.690]  And then if we have time, we can do six through ten,
[56:28.830 --> 56:31.270]  or if it's really popular, we can do that in a supplemental episode.
[56:33.170 --> 56:34.450]  Gavin, did you understand all that?
[56:34.550 --> 56:35.750]  An additional supplemental episode.
[56:36.010 --> 56:36.770]  Yeah, I love it.
[56:36.770 --> 56:37.930]  Okay, just making sure.
[56:38.690 --> 56:42.470]  So like, everybody assign a number value, one through ten.
[56:42.770 --> 56:47.450]  Then when we collate it, the lowest numbered items are the highest on the list.
[56:47.730 --> 56:50.470]  So like, if I like banana the best, so that's my number one.
[56:50.890 --> 56:52.530]  And so whatever, okay, got it, cool.
[56:52.590 --> 56:54.310]  So I would give it one point, and I hate...
[56:54.310 --> 56:57.590]  I like chocolate the least, probably, so I would give it a ten.
[56:57.850 --> 56:58.250]  Good lord.
[56:58.710 --> 57:04.030]  Okay, but everybody go ahead and write down your number one flavor for all ten items.
[57:04.350 --> 57:05.930]  Then we'll just try to get through them if we can,
[57:05.970 --> 57:08.450]  but we'll probably just do five and then split it into another video if we decide.
[57:08.730 --> 57:10.390]  I think that's a really good idea.
[57:10.770 --> 57:14.490]  I'll work with Gracie, we'll schedule some times where we can do this.
[57:14.650 --> 57:17.630]  Maybe, well, not next week, but maybe the week after.
[57:17.970 --> 57:20.390]  And then, yeah, we can do some...
[57:21.810 --> 57:23.930]  We can do a cheeky flavor draft.
[57:24.350 --> 57:25.310]  Did I use that right?
[57:25.990 --> 57:26.350]  Yes.
[57:26.590 --> 57:27.010]  Okay, cool.
[57:27.210 --> 57:28.070]  That was excellent.
[57:28.390 --> 57:28.910]  Thank you.
[57:29.250 --> 57:33.110]  I felt like I was at Gavin's Nan's house.
[57:34.910 --> 57:36.230]  Are you allowed to meet her?
[57:36.970 --> 57:37.590]  I met her.
[57:37.930 --> 57:38.790]  Oh, that's fantastic.
[57:38.810 --> 57:39.230]  Yeah, they've met.
[57:39.590 --> 57:40.190]  They love each other.
[57:40.590 --> 57:42.030]  I love his grandparents.
[57:42.310 --> 57:44.570]  I know I would love his mom if I were ever allowed to meet her.
[57:44.730 --> 57:45.710]  If you were allowed to, yeah.
[57:45.890 --> 57:46.510]  I mean, but...
[57:46.510 --> 57:46.890]  Yeah, it's a whole thing.
[57:47.650 --> 57:48.190]  Okay, cool.
[57:48.290 --> 57:49.770]  Then we'll schedule a flavor draft.
[57:50.270 --> 57:51.310]  I like this format.
[57:51.310 --> 57:57.010]  I like that we are doing new and experimental ways of drafting.
[57:57.330 --> 58:03.310]  You know what's messed up is that vanilla is often the most boring, bland flavor.
[58:03.510 --> 58:04.190]  It's referred to as...
[58:04.190 --> 58:05.810]  I think that's still too extreme.
[58:06.930 --> 58:08.450]  Oh, vanilla is a flavor.
[58:08.670 --> 58:09.310]  I'm with you.
[58:09.930 --> 58:11.790]  Vanilla is one of my favorite flavors.
[58:11.890 --> 58:12.650]  Might be my number one.
[58:13.750 --> 58:20.550]  One of my favorite insults in Survivor is somebody saying that I would call a person's
[58:20.550 --> 58:25.330]  personality vanilla-flavored, but people claim, like, clamor for vanilla-flavored products.
[58:25.890 --> 58:27.630]  Nobody wants what Julie is.
[58:28.550 --> 58:30.370]  Yeah, like, water.
[58:31.070 --> 58:31.390]  Right.
[58:32.330 --> 58:33.530]  But it doesn't have a flavor.
[58:34.350 --> 58:34.790]  Right.
[58:36.310 --> 58:40.470]  I kind of want Gavin just to, like, create a dish of the most flavorful...
[58:40.470 --> 58:44.130]  You're annoyed because vanilla is a euphemism for bland.
[58:44.950 --> 58:47.930]  Yeah, when it's, in my opinion, quite divisive flavor.
[58:48.230 --> 58:50.450]  Dude, then you should definitely score it appropriately.
[58:50.550 --> 58:54.390]  I want to do this flavor draft.
[58:54.490 --> 58:55.130]  We're gonna find time.
[58:55.190 --> 58:55.690]  We're gonna do it.
[58:55.750 --> 58:56.610]  I'm excited about it.
[58:56.710 --> 59:00.270]  I also want Gavin to just separately present his top 10 flavors.
[59:00.490 --> 59:01.550]  Oh, that's great.
[59:01.990 --> 59:03.970]  And we don't have to do anything with that.
[59:04.050 --> 59:05.350]  That doesn't have to be...
[59:05.350 --> 59:07.390]  That doesn't factor into our flavor draft.
[59:07.510 --> 59:11.670]  But at the end, I would love for him to go, and now here are my top 10 flavors.
[59:11.830 --> 59:14.730]  Not off of our list, right, of regulation flavors.
[59:14.870 --> 59:16.030]  Just his Gavin flavors.
[59:16.210 --> 59:17.490]  That would be thrilling for me.
[59:17.490 --> 59:21.630]  So I could potentially have stuff like cola or like water on there.
[59:22.010 --> 59:22.210]  Yeah.
[59:22.810 --> 59:23.910]  Yeah, yeah.
[59:23.950 --> 59:24.670]  But again...
[59:24.670 --> 59:29.010]  If water is your favorite flavor, then as a drink, it's phenomenal.
[59:29.370 --> 59:34.330]  I want to be really clear that that doesn't factor into our regulation flavor draft,
[59:34.410 --> 59:37.570]  which we have figured out and we are settled on these 10 flavors.
[59:37.850 --> 59:42.990]  This is a separate thing that you will just let us know about separately.
[59:43.630 --> 59:44.110]  That's all.
[59:44.110 --> 59:48.130]  And Eric, when does the freaking strumming video come out?
[59:48.390 --> 59:50.070]  By the time this is out, that's out.
[59:51.050 --> 59:51.670]  Wow, really?
[59:52.030 --> 59:52.230]  Yeah.
[59:52.770 --> 59:54.990]  I mean, as long as you can give it to us,
[59:55.050 --> 59:58.030]  and then it's like there are no notes that Geoff has suddenly.
[59:58.550 --> 59:58.750]  Yeah.
[59:59.650 --> 01:00:00.090]  All right.
[01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:02.050]  Yeah, I don't think I'll have any notes.
[01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:02.930]  I'm not the notes guy.
[01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:04.470]  Hey, I have a...
[01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:05.930]  I know we're probably getting close to wrapping up,
[01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:09.470]  but I have one other problem I wanted to talk to you guys about.
[01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:11.050]  Actually, I have a ton more to talk.
[01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:13.470]  I could do another episode just with notes I have.
[01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:15.590]  Actually, you know what?
[01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:18.890]  No, yeah, I'll tell you.
[01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:22.890]  I realized the other day, and I mentioned this to Eric and Gavin a little bit,
[01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:24.950]  but it's something that's been kind of plaguing me, Andrew.
[01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:28.250]  I realized the other day, it just hit me all at once.
[01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:29.870]  I don't believe in Bigfoot anymore.
[01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:32.010]  Oh God, I remember this.
[01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:32.670]  Oh no, what happened?
[01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:33.370]  I don't know.
[01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:39.110]  I just realized, like, in my living room, I don't believe in Bigfoot.
[01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:40.330]  I don't think he ever existed.
[01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:42.570]  And I used to definitely believe in Bigfoot.
[01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:45.650]  And in that process, sitting down and thinking about it,
[01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:48.570]  I realized I don't believe in the Loch Ness Monster either,
[01:00:48.810 --> 01:00:52.810]  and I haven't for a long time, but I don't remember when that changed.
[01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:55.390]  Like, I don't remember deciding I don't believe in the Loch Ness Monster,
[01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:56.490]  which got me wondering,
[01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:59.990]  have you guys ever realized that your opinion changed on something,
[01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:01.990]  and you don't know when or how it just did,
[01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:03.550]  and you realized it years later?
[01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:04.970]  Or at some time later?
[01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:08.050]  I always find it weird that I don't remember a specific moment where
[01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:10.130]  I didn't believe in Santa anymore.
[01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:12.450]  Because my parents did the whole Santa thing,
[01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:14.830]  but I don't remember a big moment where it was like,
[01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:16.810]  finding out he wasn't real.
[01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:18.950]  Yeah, I remember it. Spoiler moment.
[01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:22.330]  Yeah, you learned, like, all three at once, I remember.
[01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:23.410]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:24.290]  In the show.
[01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:26.650]  The triple whammy. That's why I'm like I am now.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.480]  I'm trying to think.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:34.520]  Okay, so this is sort of similar, I guess, to that idea.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.800]  But as I mentioned, I bought...
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:40.320]  I just, I haven't had Kool-Aid in a really long time.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.960]  And so I bought a box of every flavor of Kool-Aid jammer.
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:46.700]  One box of each, just to try all of them.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.500]  Now, is it jammer?
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:48.360]  Last time I had it.
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.920]  Is it jammer? Is that like in a pout? Like a flavor?
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.260]  Yeah, it's like in the pouch.
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:53.220]  You don't like mix it yourself.
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:53.620]  It's pre-made Kool-Aid.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.300]  Okay, just want to make sure.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.700]  Yeah, it's pre-made. Yeah.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.520]  And the last time I had it,
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.460]  I remember disliking every flavor but one.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.240]  But I thought, oh, maybe things have changed.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.560]  Sounds like you're not a big flavor guy.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.460]  Well, I love flavor. I just didn't appreciate this flavor.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:06.900]  Okay.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.520]  So I tried two, two or three of them.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.180]  And I was like, ah, this still stands.
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.880]  I don't really like these. That's too bad.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.880]  I've got like 50 packets of these Kool-Aid things to drink through.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.780]  About halfway through, something changed and I really like them now.
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:23.020]  And I don't know what it is.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:27.880]  And it is sort of alarming to me that like my tastes have changed at the Kool-Aid time.
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:31.440]  At the same time, I ordered a burger from a place
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.560]  that I viewed as like a very mid-tier burger place.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.320]  Best burger I've ever had.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.880]  So I've had a little bit of a crisis of like,
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.240]  did these products change in some way?
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.220]  Or has my mouth changed in the middle of this process?
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.920]  And now I need to reevaluate everything I've tried.
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:49.860]  It's got to be the mouth. I had the exact same thing with ketchup.
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.380]  I never had it as a kid.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.860]  I was probably 25 when I started liking it.
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:57.360]  Do you remember when?
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.920]  I think I just had some really shit chips and I just dunked into someone else's ketchup.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:03.820]  And I just thought, wow.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.100]  Now, do you think that you had liked ketchup for much longer than that?
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.100]  You just didn't know it?
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:10.440]  Or do you think it really-
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.760]  No, I definitely tried it as a kid and hated it.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:16.300]  Right. But I mean, if you had tried ketchup, I don't know,
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.240]  a year before you did and discovered you liked it,
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.140]  do you think you would have liked it?
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.880]  Or do you think that you needed to be exactly where you were?
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:26.980]  No, I assume my palate changed way longer ago than when I tried it.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.420]  I think I could have been having ketchup for years at that point.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.240]  Andrew, I think your palate probably changed a while ago
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.260]  and you're just catching up.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:34.140]  You're finding out about it.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:38.380]  But the mid-kool-aid is what, like, it happened.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.980]  I didn't like it, now I like it.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.020]  It could have been like you had a flavor awakening, you know?
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.180]  Like it changed.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.620]  Some new buds opened up.
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:48.600]  I'm trying to think, I've had a few instances,
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.560]  like I didn't used to like spicy food and then all at once I did,
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.220]  but it was only that one thing.
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.000]  It didn't change how I felt about any other food.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.800]  Or like, I didn't used to like raisins,
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.860]  and then one day I woke up in my 30s and realized I liked raisins
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.220]  and I went and had raisins and they were delicious.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.160]  Oh, I'm not there yet.
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.120]  They're good. I really do, I really do dig them.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:09.720]  Although, you know, I haven't tried them in probably at least 10 years.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.640]  Try some golden raisins, see what you think.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.340]  Man, Andrew, you need to try lots of different things right now.
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.840]  You could be, you could completely and change,
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:22.220]  you can completely and totally change your flavor palette overnight.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:23.720]  What if you're an egg guy?
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.600]  What if you're only eggs?
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:29.680]  What if, what if the egg window was closed and I never knew I was?
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.560]  That's a haunting thought.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.160]  Like you don't, you don't like eggs now, but you...
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.920]  Yeah, like now, but I, but I would have in the past.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.920]  Now that things have changed, I no longer do,
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:43.760]  but maybe I would have prior to this big taste change that I've had.
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:46.020]  Can we just give you a big food gauntlet?
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:46.460]  Yeah.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:48.280]  Like a nibble of egg and you'd score it.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:49.140]  I'll do whatever.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.720]  We should definitely do that in person someday.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:01.320]  All right, we should probably start thinking about wrapping this up.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.860]  Does anybody else have anything you want to talk about?
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.820]  Eric, have you ever read Pooch Cafe?
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.100]  Well, he's gone, isn't he?
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:07.720]  Yeah.
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:08.340]  Oh, he left?
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.580]  Cover for the fact that Eric said he had to duck out for a meeting.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.560]  But you immediately throw to Eric.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.320]  Oh, I didn't see that. I was reading Pooch Cafe.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.860]  It's a, it's a little comic strip.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.360]  I guess I'll find out next time.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:23.080]  Hey, have y'all, y'all know how we've been getting a ton of images of the balaclava in?
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:23.960]  Yeah.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.980]  People putting the balaclava on and showing it.
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:30.360]  And I've been amazed at watching complete strangers transform into Andrew
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.720]  instantly. Like, it's amazing. It's like you, it's like it's you in the photo.
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.460]  It's, it's so perfect.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:39.900]  And that got me wondering, like, what other, like, people sleeves do people wear?
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.980]  And the only thing I could think of is, you know how, like,
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:47.560]  some people will wear, like, that sleeve down their arm with fake tattoos on it.
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.320]  So it looks like you have a tattoo sleeve on your arm.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:49.880]  Yeah.
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.180]  How come we don't do that with other body parts?
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:53.840]  Well, like...
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:59.240]  Like, for instance, what if we made Gavin's regulation knee?
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:04.160]  And then you could just put on a knee thing that's, you would transform your knee into Gavin's knee.
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.940]  So we just all scan our limbs and you can mix and match?
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:12.620]  Could, yeah. I think you start with one, like, uh, you know, Andrew's elbow or something.
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:16.720]  That is a horrifying idea of, like, a person with all of our limb specifics.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:17.340]  Yeah.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:17.900]  Randomized.
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.200]  I don't think you want my knee.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:20.700]  What's wrong with your knees?
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.880]  I got big, I had stitches in it, it's messy.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.900]  Yeah, but I had stitches in my knee too.
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.060]  Andrew, how are your knees?
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.640]  They're fine, I would say.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:30.860]  Regulation knees.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:32.100]  Oh yeah, he did your face though.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.660]  Well, regulation knee is what we want.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.960]  Anyway, just something to think about.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.180]  How come we don't, you know, we don't scan, like, we could have Geoff's foot
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:41.880]  that you could slip on over your foot and it would be like my foot.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.000]  Just like we did with Andrew's face.
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:47.020]  What's the name of the face thing that we sold with my face on it?
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:47.960]  Balaclava?
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:51.520]  Yeah, I need to save space, make a confession.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:55.460]  Um, I'm scared to say that word because I don't trust myself
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:58.760]  that I'm not going to say baklava, which I know is wrong.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.760]  That's a food.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.220]  It's a dessert. Yeah, it's a food.
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:02.580]  Yeah.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:08.180]  Yeah, so I just, I avoid saying it as much as possible because it sounds like baklava
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:11.600]  and that's what I think of more than balaclava. I've never said that before.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.900]  Well, you could wear that too.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:13.680]  I guess you could.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:15.580]  Heat up the face a little bit, some insulation.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.440]  Anyway, we should wrap this up.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.600]  It turned into like, how are we going to skin ourselves and sell it?
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.800]  No, I was just thinking like, it's so cool to watch all these people transform into
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:34.420]  Andrew's face, but what other body parts could you transform somebody into, you know?
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.480]  I think maybe my chest.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.680]  Gavin's got, you got a good chest.
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:39.240]  Like if we made it.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.900]  No, it's not good. It's just, it's wearable.
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:44.860]  It's like, uh, it's all, it's like horrible hair, like most of it's gray.
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:46.280]  Keep you warm.
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:48.360]  Okay, something to think about.
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:52.720]  If you get too cold on a, on one of those winter nights, just slip on Gavin's chest.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.620]  Let's wrap this up or else I'm going to read why Kevin Costner explains why he left the
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:07:59.540]  hit show Yellowstone.
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.160]  Thanks.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:05.100]  Thanks for listening to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:08.100]  Boy, we sure hope you enjoyed it.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.860]  It's been a weird day.
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.380]  We recorded two back to back.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.520]  I don't know what I think about either of them right now, but we did, uh, we did give
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:19.300]  you guys a little, uh, a little bit of a preview and some changes.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:22.700]  Uh, just to recap, we're going to be releasing video game content on the channel.
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:27.900]  Let's play YouTube channel starting October 6th with a worms.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:29.100]  Let's play, I believe.
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:30.660]  Don't quote me on that though.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.520]  It could be something different.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.520]  And, uh, rate and review five stars.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:37.080]  Tell a friend, uh, all that stuff.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:37.720]  Bye.
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:42.600]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.080]  Eric wants the guys to start the episode.
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:46.360]  Gavin is in a church.
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:47.760]  No more Starfield.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.740]  Geoff apologizing may be the worst thing ever.
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.340]  Gracie is down for potatoes.
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:53.780]  Do you talk to yourself?
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.440]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:59.580]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
