[00:00.000 --> 00:02.480]  This episode is brought to you by Pacifico.
[00:02.920 --> 00:04.980]  Here's a story you've probably never heard.
[00:05.440 --> 00:10.440]  Legend has it, decades ago, a couple surfers went down to Mexico in search of epic swells,
[00:10.560 --> 00:12.380]  but they found something unexpected instead.
[00:12.780 --> 00:17.260]  It was still crisp, lively, and smooth, but it had nothing to do with waves.
[00:17.600 --> 00:20.140]  It was Pacifico, a delicious Mexican lager.
[00:20.600 --> 00:22.600]  It's like it was brewed to be discovered.

[00:40.360 --> 00:42.420]  Are you guys okay if I tell a gross story?
[00:42.840 --> 00:43.440]  Oh, yes.
[00:43.560 --> 00:44.480]  I'm okay with it.
[00:45.220 --> 00:46.560]  Goddamn, Nick is fucking...
[00:47.700 --> 00:48.280]  Shot out of a cannon with that.
[00:48.280 --> 00:49.920]  Nick is fist-pumping right now.
[00:50.440 --> 00:51.380]  He's been waiting.
[00:51.780 --> 00:52.380]  I wanna hear.
[00:55.160 --> 00:56.760]  I love Brooklyn stories.
[00:57.500 --> 00:57.740]  Alright.
[00:58.160 --> 00:59.700]  It's not that gross, but it's gross.
[01:00.280 --> 01:04.260]  He's doing like the Nick Cage head spin and face-off when he's dressed as the priest.
[01:04.340 --> 01:06.080]  He's just fucking going wild over this.
[01:06.080 --> 01:07.520]  Goddamn, that was funny.
[01:08.580 --> 01:12.780]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:13.100 --> 01:15.520]  This is episode 176.
[01:16.160 --> 01:20.760]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always, Andrew Pantin and Gavin Free.
[01:21.180 --> 01:21.560]  Hello.
[01:21.840 --> 01:22.220]  Hiya.
[01:22.600 --> 01:23.120]  Hi.
[01:23.800 --> 01:24.840]  That's my name.
[01:25.240 --> 01:25.840]  I felt...
[01:25.840 --> 01:26.820]  Your name is Andrew.
[01:26.980 --> 01:29.120]  I felt like that was a pretty good intro.
[01:29.260 --> 01:29.540]  That's me.
[01:29.700 --> 01:31.020]  It was like nobody stepped on me.
[01:31.460 --> 01:32.300]  I didn't stutter.
[01:32.800 --> 01:34.100]  I feel like we nailed that one.
[01:34.100 --> 01:41.140]  That's like if you want to show a dictionary definition of a good intro, I feel like you
[01:41.140 --> 01:41.620]  could show that.
[01:42.080 --> 01:44.720]  I don't think it would be near the definition of energy, though.
[01:45.040 --> 01:45.340]  No.
[01:45.360 --> 01:46.160]  You don't think I had energy?
[01:46.680 --> 01:50.340]  No, I think you had energy, but it wasn't like... it wouldn't be a defining intro for
[01:50.340 --> 01:50.640]  energy.
[01:50.920 --> 01:54.140]  I think it was a perfectly acceptable intro to this show.
[01:54.360 --> 01:56.340]  Not memorable, either way.
[01:56.700 --> 01:56.920]  But like funny.
[01:56.920 --> 01:59.540]  I felt like it was... not memorable.
[02:00.440 --> 02:00.880]  No.
[02:00.880 --> 02:04.860]  And I say that like with nothing but respect and love for you, Geoff.
[02:05.000 --> 02:06.000]  Why don't you show me...
[02:06.000 --> 02:06.900]  All right, little dickhead.
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.380]  Why don't you show me... why don't you show me energy?
[02:10.540 --> 02:11.220]  Oh, you want energy?
[02:11.480 --> 02:13.340]  Well, this is Wacky Energy.
[02:13.680 --> 02:15.100]  This is a talk show.
[02:15.440 --> 02:16.640]  Morning radio.
[02:17.400 --> 02:20.560]  We're listening to F*** Face on the station 106.45 The Wave.
[02:21.440 --> 02:24.040]  Why did you change the whole intro with energy, though?
[02:24.640 --> 02:25.580]  I don't know.
[02:25.880 --> 02:30.640]  I just... I went into... when I think energy and like talking, I think like radio because
[02:30.640 --> 02:31.680]  it feels very forced.
[02:31.940 --> 02:32.800]  I will say that, Geoff.
[02:32.860 --> 02:34.000]  You didn't have a forced energy.
[02:34.180 --> 02:39.360]  So you want me to do forced radio DJ energy to start this episode?
[02:39.360 --> 02:40.160]  Yes, I do, actually.
[02:40.300 --> 02:42.140]  I'd love to hear you do forced radio energy.
[02:43.080 --> 02:43.960]  Oh, God.
[02:44.840 --> 02:46.880]  See, it's not in you today because you're just not there.
[02:47.100 --> 02:50.700]  Hello and welcome to another episode of Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew F*** Face.
[02:51.940 --> 02:52.400]  That's right.
[02:52.440 --> 02:54.720]  It's me, the gator, Geoff Ramsey.
[02:54.720 --> 03:00.720]  And with me, as always, the Gooch Pooch, Gabby Wabby, and Johnny Caviar.
[03:01.680 --> 03:02.720]  What's going on, fellas?
[03:03.560 --> 03:06.220]  Now, that was very high energy, but I think your other one was better.
[03:06.500 --> 03:07.440]  But that was great energy.
[03:07.940 --> 03:08.480]  10 out of 10.
[03:08.760 --> 03:09.260]  That was memorable.
[03:09.280 --> 03:09.760]  We gotta move on.
[03:09.960 --> 03:11.040]  I don't know why I said gator.
[03:11.180 --> 03:12.240]  Eric's asking why I said gator.
[03:12.360 --> 03:12.800]  I don't know.
[03:12.860 --> 03:13.740]  It just seemed like an important thing.
[03:13.740 --> 03:15.220]  It came out of you, and I like that.
[03:15.300 --> 03:16.560]  I like that we learned that about you today.
[03:16.580 --> 03:18.220]  I think we got a new spontaneous nickname.
[03:18.880 --> 03:19.720]  Yeah, Gator.
[03:20.500 --> 03:21.520]  Geoff the Gator Ramsey.
[03:21.840 --> 03:22.820]  I'm not mad at gator.
[03:22.820 --> 03:24.900]  I don't like it as much as T-Bone, but I'll take gator.
[03:25.580 --> 03:27.740]  Gator feels like they would be friends with T-Bone.
[03:27.840 --> 03:30.120]  Like, if T-Bone had a friend named Gator, that just checks out.
[03:30.260 --> 03:30.800]  That feels right.
[03:31.340 --> 03:33.400]  T-Bone and Gator sounds like...
[03:33.400 --> 03:37.300]  That sounds like an adventure two dudes have hopping trains, you know?
[03:37.520 --> 03:37.920]  Yes.
[03:38.260 --> 03:39.580]  The adventure of T-Bone and Gator.
[03:40.440 --> 03:44.540]  Traveling across the country, mixing it up, getting into trouble, getting out of trouble.
[03:45.100 --> 03:45.500]  Yeah.
[03:46.440 --> 03:48.980]  I'd listen or watch T-Bone and Gator for sure.
[03:49.740 --> 03:50.440]  Either way.
[03:50.740 --> 03:52.620]  I've made a worst of all time discovery.
[03:53.060 --> 03:54.020]  Oh, you did?
[03:54.700 --> 03:57.080]  Yeah, I don't know what the theme is for worst of all time.
[03:57.160 --> 03:57.980]  It could just be anything, right?
[03:58.500 --> 03:58.620]  Yeah.
[03:58.680 --> 03:59.820]  Well, it was sports, wasn't it?
[03:59.940 --> 04:01.480]  I thought it was sports specific.
[04:01.620 --> 04:01.900]  Oh, okay.
[04:02.020 --> 04:02.740]  This isn't sports.
[04:03.240 --> 04:03.580]  It could...
[04:03.580 --> 04:03.940]  Well, that's fine.
[04:04.100 --> 04:05.420]  I still want to hear your worst of all time.
[04:05.700 --> 04:10.340]  Okay, the worst social media video editor of all time.
[04:11.140 --> 04:11.420]  Oh.
[04:11.980 --> 04:12.700]  Britney Spears.
[04:12.940 --> 04:14.820]  She is absolutely dog shit.
[04:15.220 --> 04:16.900]  There's cuts in the middle of words.
[04:17.460 --> 04:19.400]  There's like repetition of the same...
[04:19.400 --> 04:20.580]  None of it makes any sense.
[04:20.980 --> 04:21.980]  Do you think that's on her?
[04:22.820 --> 04:24.340]  Well, like, is it her doing it?
[04:24.820 --> 04:25.120]  Yeah.
[04:25.680 --> 04:26.300]  Oh, I don't know.
[04:26.740 --> 04:28.220]  I would assume not.
[04:28.760 --> 04:29.060]  Really?
[04:29.640 --> 04:30.840]  I don't think so.
[04:31.460 --> 04:33.000]  Ah, I don't know.
[04:33.440 --> 04:34.240]  But I have no idea.
[04:34.280 --> 04:34.760]  It could be.
[04:35.020 --> 04:35.600]  It's true.
[04:36.020 --> 04:38.240]  I'm not in the Britney Spears loop right now.
[04:39.720 --> 04:41.180]  Yeah, I don't know.
[04:42.220 --> 04:46.980]  You know, nothing against her, but there's absolutely no cohesion through it.
[04:47.240 --> 04:52.280]  You know, I saw the other day that she had a video recently, a non-cohesive video recently,
[04:52.280 --> 04:54.300]  where she was clanging knives together.
[04:55.420 --> 05:00.140]  And I read that the police department did a health and welfare check on her because of that.
[05:00.680 --> 05:01.940]  I assume they weren't real knives.
[05:02.120 --> 05:02.900]  Were they actual knives?
[05:03.340 --> 05:05.400]  I don't know, but I'm glad that people are looking out for her.
[05:05.760 --> 05:06.160]  Yeah.
[05:06.660 --> 05:07.420]  That's not a joke.
[05:07.540 --> 05:08.540]  I love Britney Spears.
[05:08.780 --> 05:11.540]  I want her to be happy and healthy.
[05:12.140 --> 05:12.740]  I think we all do.
[05:12.740 --> 05:13.560]  And enjoying freedom.
[05:14.060 --> 05:14.640]  Yeah, right?
[05:14.700 --> 05:18.580]  Like, she had a fucking raw deal with that conservatorship, and she's finally free of it.
[05:18.980 --> 05:21.220]  And newly divorced now, too, apparently, which is sad.
[05:21.220 --> 05:23.160]  Oh, yeah, we were just talking about her recently.
[05:23.680 --> 05:25.580]  And her young husband.
[05:26.000 --> 05:27.620]  Young ex-husband. Soon-to-be ex-husband.
[05:28.140 --> 05:29.280]  Yeah, were we the cause of that?
[05:30.080 --> 05:32.640]  I think we were the cause of something else recently, weren't we?
[05:33.340 --> 05:33.680]  No.
[05:34.460 --> 05:34.760]  Okay.
[05:35.000 --> 05:35.580]  Absolutely not.
[05:37.200 --> 05:38.140]  Let's just stop it there.
[05:38.440 --> 05:38.900]  We weren't.
[05:40.560 --> 05:41.720]  We 100% were not.
[05:41.940 --> 05:42.500]  Oh, good.
[05:43.000 --> 05:44.220]  You wanna hear my worst of all time?
[05:44.280 --> 05:45.100]  I got a worst of all time.
[05:45.180 --> 05:45.920]  It's sports related.
[05:46.200 --> 05:46.540]  Okay.
[05:46.740 --> 05:47.020]  MMA.
[05:47.760 --> 05:50.280]  I don't know if anyone else has done research for this.
[05:50.280 --> 05:54.540]  I kinda struggled with, like, you don't want somebody that, like, just bounced out of any
[05:54.540 --> 05:55.340]  league immediately.
[05:55.740 --> 05:56.480]  Like, I don't know.
[05:56.540 --> 05:57.880]  I just feel like that's...
[05:57.880 --> 06:00.580]  You want, like, longevity in their badness.
[06:00.660 --> 06:05.340]  Or, like, they were so uniquely bad that things, like, ended.
[06:05.660 --> 06:07.580]  Or that's, like, the blemish on their thing.
[06:08.020 --> 06:13.360]  My worst of all time, and it's to this day, the worst sporting moment I've ever seen for
[06:13.360 --> 06:20.180]  just being completely unenjoyable, nothing great about it, is an MMA fight between Miguel
[06:20.180 --> 06:25.880]  Falco and Gerald Harris, which happened, like, over 10 years ago at this point, I'd say.
[06:26.280 --> 06:27.300]  And I still think about it.
[06:27.640 --> 06:30.720]  The most non-exciting... just nothing happened.
[06:31.060 --> 06:33.180]  Just two guys looking at each other.
[06:33.420 --> 06:35.960]  And it was Miguel Falco's first fight in the UFC.
[06:36.320 --> 06:41.040]  And he had all this rep going into it as, like, this devastating knockout puncher that
[06:41.040 --> 06:42.120]  is gonna destroy everyone.
[06:42.260 --> 06:45.100]  Like, none of his fights exited the... like, made it out of the first round.
[06:45.280 --> 06:48.880]  And it was just nothingness for the entire time.
[06:48.880 --> 06:53.740]  Type of match where if it was the first ever MMA fight, the whole sport wouldn't have taken
[06:53.740 --> 06:53.920]  over.
[06:53.920 --> 06:54.820]  It would have collapsed.
[06:55.140 --> 07:00.940]  And that... and that is only emphasized by the fact that that is Miguel Falco's only
[07:00.940 --> 07:01.900]  fight in the UFC.
[07:02.100 --> 07:06.280]  I think he got arrested for something and there was visa issues.
[07:06.400 --> 07:11.260]  So then he was quickly, like, once other problems showed up, cut from the roster.
[07:11.660 --> 07:16.080]  But what made it, like, exceptionally bad is he's fighting a guy named Gerald Harris.
[07:16.080 --> 07:21.980]  And at that time, the kind of general rule in the UFC was if you lose three fights in a
[07:21.980 --> 07:23.180]  row, you're done.
[07:23.320 --> 07:24.640]  But that is sort of the exception.
[07:24.820 --> 07:26.060]  Like, three fights, you're out.
[07:26.440 --> 07:31.980]  He was on a three fight winning streak, lost that fight, and was cut from the roster because
[07:31.980 --> 07:32.960]  it was so boring.
[07:33.200 --> 07:33.900]  Won and out.
[07:34.640 --> 07:35.680]  Won and out.
[07:35.780 --> 07:37.140]  One loss and out.
[07:37.560 --> 07:42.640]  So that is my worst of all time when I think of sports is immediately to Miguel Falco,
[07:43.080 --> 07:43.740]  Gerald Harris.
[07:43.740 --> 07:47.820]  It's a shame, too, because Miguel Falco was a really good fighting name.
[07:48.000 --> 07:49.780]  Like, you could have the Falco Punch.
[07:50.420 --> 07:53.460]  You could be protected by Falcos.
[07:53.580 --> 07:54.740]  You could be protected by Falcos.
[07:54.960 --> 07:55.200]  Exactly.
[07:56.060 --> 08:01.060]  You could be some version of E.D. Falco, I guess.
[08:02.720 --> 08:04.640]  You could be Nurse Betty.
[08:06.060 --> 08:07.380]  Well, no, what about Falcon Punch?
[08:07.480 --> 08:08.800]  Like, I think of Star Fox.
[08:08.960 --> 08:11.600]  Like, it's not exactly the same, but that's my Falco Punch.
[08:11.800 --> 08:12.920]  Yeah, isn't that what you just said?
[08:12.920 --> 08:14.740]  It was the first thing.
[08:15.380 --> 08:17.900]  Geoff, do you have a vote for anything?
[08:18.460 --> 08:21.480]  No, I haven't looked into it yet, unfortunately.
[08:21.820 --> 08:25.340]  I apologize, but I will deliver some votes for you guys soon.
[08:25.720 --> 08:29.620]  I have one, but I don't think you guys are going to agree that it's a vote.
[08:29.980 --> 08:30.460]  Okay.
[08:30.740 --> 08:37.360]  But it is the thing in which all votes are judged to me, which is Mario Mendoza,
[08:37.360 --> 08:40.900]  former baseball player, as he was so bad
[08:42.200 --> 08:45.380]  having a league average, a batting average of 200,
[08:45.660 --> 08:50.100]  that they named the 200 batting average the Mendoza line,
[08:50.800 --> 08:55.600]  where if you are batting below 200, you are likely to get cut or sent down.
[08:56.020 --> 08:58.580]  And that is the line at which he batted,
[08:59.380 --> 09:03.000]  I think, almost every year of his professional career.
[09:03.680 --> 09:15.620]  So to be so bad that they name the bar that they judge people being bad after you,
[09:16.000 --> 09:23.820]  to me, is really exceptional and really stand out in terms of what the vote is.
[09:23.960 --> 09:28.140]  I would argue that if he's not below his own bar, there's other votes.
[09:28.140 --> 09:29.480]  Exactly. There are.
[09:29.660 --> 09:35.240]  But they are, like Geoff's intro today, not memorable.
[09:35.960 --> 09:41.200]  And Mario Mendoza is due to the Mendoza line.
[09:42.340 --> 09:46.460]  God damn it, why do I keep catching stray bullets about my fucking intro?
[09:46.660 --> 09:49.540]  It was a perfectly regulation intro, thank you, Gavin.
[09:49.980 --> 09:51.560]  Yeah, no, it was fine. Sorry, Gator.
[09:51.780 --> 09:53.960]  I just thought that, you know, it's just not memorable.
[09:54.280 --> 09:56.280]  And I think Mario Mendoza is.
[09:56.280 --> 10:00.340]  I think I got a nickname. I think a nickname came out of it.
[10:00.380 --> 10:01.700]  So that is pretty memorable right there.
[10:01.920 --> 10:02.300]  That's true.
[10:02.800 --> 10:03.520]  Fucking hell.
[10:03.840 --> 10:05.920]  Well, the nickname came on the redo, to be fair.
[10:05.940 --> 10:07.520]  Yeah, it didn't come from your unmemorable intro.
[10:07.540 --> 10:09.940]  Yeah, but if I hadn't done a perfectly regulation,
[10:10.580 --> 10:14.740]  fairly memorable intro that then you guys shit on, I wouldn't have done the second intro.
[10:14.900 --> 10:18.020]  Yeah, but that's all butterfly effect stuff. You can't really argue, you know,
[10:18.060 --> 10:22.100]  that's like going back like three trades or like three years in the NBA and going like,
[10:22.160 --> 10:24.720]  well, if this guy didn't get traded here, this wouldn't happen. You can't do that, Geoff.
[10:24.720 --> 10:26.480]  What do you think is the worst shit?
[10:27.380 --> 10:27.560]  What?
[10:27.680 --> 10:28.340]  What do you mean?
[10:28.580 --> 10:32.820]  It's like common shits, like dog shit, like if something's dog shit or like horse shit,
[10:32.920 --> 10:35.760]  if it's not true. Like what's the worst shit?
[10:35.900 --> 10:37.640]  I don't even know how to measure this.
[10:38.200 --> 10:41.360]  Well, how many shits are there? There's dog shit, horse shit.
[10:41.560 --> 10:42.100]  There's bullshit.
[10:42.840 --> 10:43.280]  Bullshit.
[10:43.580 --> 10:44.880]  Yeah, bullshit's pretty bad.
[10:45.740 --> 10:46.560]  Fish shit.
[10:46.840 --> 10:47.900]  Are we being literal?
[10:48.660 --> 10:51.600]  What about wombats? Wombats poop square.
[10:51.820 --> 10:53.100]  Oh, there's bat shit.
[10:53.360 --> 10:53.960]  Oh, like guano?
[10:53.960 --> 11:00.100]  But like, it's a weird, it's like how it's used as opposed to what the actual shit is,
[11:00.160 --> 11:01.160]  is the problem.
[11:01.580 --> 11:03.880]  I think dog shit is the worst because...
[11:04.960 --> 11:05.520]  Yeah.
[11:06.180 --> 11:08.620]  It doesn't necessarily mean anything other than terrible.
[11:09.620 --> 11:15.140]  Yeah, exactly. But I think a bull's literal shit is way worse than a dog's literal shit.
[11:15.540 --> 11:17.100]  That's just like, how are we measuring this?
[11:17.580 --> 11:20.060]  What animal has the smelliest shit?
[11:20.580 --> 11:21.440]  I have no idea.
[11:21.440 --> 11:24.520]  Animal has the smelliest shit.
[11:24.660 --> 11:25.060]  Let's see.
[11:25.260 --> 11:26.000]  I bet it's cow patty.
[11:26.020 --> 11:28.240]  What's the name of it? Maybe it's a herring.
[11:30.640 --> 11:36.960]  Horse shit, cat shit, dog shit, human shit, cow shit, pig shit, elephant shit,
[11:37.420 --> 11:39.820]  Is this a list or are you just aiming?
[11:39.820 --> 11:42.620]  Yeah, that's a list. That's it goes from one to eight or whatever.
[11:42.780 --> 11:44.620]  So apparently horse shit's the worst smelliest shit.
[11:44.620 --> 11:46.380]  A preview of our upcoming shit draft.
[11:46.640 --> 11:48.760]  But we're number four.
[11:48.760 --> 11:51.440]  So we're hanging in there as humans.
[11:51.540 --> 11:52.720]  Man, do I have a shit story for you guys?
[11:52.720 --> 11:53.140]  Let's go.
[11:55.020 --> 11:55.820]  Let's do it.
[11:56.140 --> 11:57.280]  Oh, yeah, I can do that.
[11:59.240 --> 12:01.040]  So it's been a very busy few weeks.
[12:01.120 --> 12:03.900]  I don't know if you guys know this, but I'm getting married and we're getting kind of close
[12:03.900 --> 12:05.360]  to it so that a lot of stuff is happening.
[12:06.340 --> 12:08.940]  And in addition to the fact that for some fucking reason,
[12:09.120 --> 12:12.980]  I decided to make another podcast and also start doing gaming content again.
[12:13.040 --> 12:14.200]  So I've been a little busy.
[12:14.200 --> 12:19.360]  Little Geoffy's been busy lately and it's been a particularly stressful time,
[12:19.600 --> 12:20.020]  which is cool.
[12:20.180 --> 12:25.220]  I don't mind stress, but I thought last weekend that Emily has been similarly stressed.
[12:25.320 --> 12:27.960]  So I thought I'm gonna do something nice for her and by proxy for me.
[12:28.340 --> 12:30.040]  So I booked us a couple's massage.
[12:30.400 --> 12:33.840]  Something that we always get like a couple's massage on a vacation,
[12:34.080 --> 12:35.080]  like we go to Mexico or somewhere.
[12:35.360 --> 12:35.380]  Right.
[12:35.880 --> 12:39.120]  And so I thought, well, there's no reason why we can't do one in town,
[12:39.380 --> 12:41.240]  like on a fucking Saturday sort of thing.
[12:41.320 --> 12:43.040]  Are you just both getting one at the same time?
[12:43.040 --> 12:44.740]  Yeah, no, same room.
[12:45.460 --> 12:47.780]  And so I went to this place we'd never been to before.
[12:47.900 --> 12:48.740]  It was fine.
[12:48.880 --> 12:55.940]  It's one of those, you know, spa chains, fairly regulation place.
[12:56.300 --> 12:58.740]  And, you know, the way most of them were,
[12:58.820 --> 13:00.440]  I don't know if you guys have had couples massages before,
[13:00.600 --> 13:04.120]  but the way it traditionally works when I do this is there's like a,
[13:04.700 --> 13:07.020]  they tell you to get there like 20 minutes early because they want you to like
[13:07.020 --> 13:10.420]  get undressed and get into your robe and chill out in their little waiting room
[13:10.420 --> 13:13.520]  and listen to Whale's Mate or whatever and drink cucumber water.
[13:14.280 --> 13:16.460]  And so we get there 20 minutes early or whatever,
[13:16.900 --> 13:19.380]  and they take us into a room and it's like a little,
[13:19.900 --> 13:22.060]  I don't know, meditation, calming room.
[13:22.180 --> 13:25.060]  It's got some, you know, it's got like fucking bamboos and shit in there.
[13:25.460 --> 13:28.540]  And there's like a door to the left for the men's room and a door to the right
[13:28.540 --> 13:29.200]  for the ladies room.
[13:29.280 --> 13:31.320]  And they go, just make yourselves comfortable and whenever you're ready,
[13:31.400 --> 13:33.860]  go in and change your clothes and then come back out.
[13:34.200 --> 13:36.820]  Sit here for 15 to 20 minutes, you know,
[13:37.260 --> 13:40.080]  smell the aromatics or whatever the fuck is going on in here.
[13:40.080 --> 13:42.940]  Relax and we'll come get you and massage you.
[13:43.400 --> 13:47.920]  And so I go into the men's room and Emily goes into the women's room
[13:47.920 --> 13:50.520]  and you walk in and there's like a,
[13:50.860 --> 13:53.900]  there's just like a stall that's shut and then a shower to the right.
[13:54.020 --> 13:58.700]  And then on the left, some, what do you call that thing?
[13:58.720 --> 13:59.580]  A sink, right?
[13:59.760 --> 14:04.520]  And then on the right, there's a couple of, there's lockers to put your shit in.
[14:04.780 --> 14:08.720]  And so I start to get undressed and put my stuff in the locker.
[14:09.240 --> 14:09.960]  And I'm not thinking anything.
[14:09.960 --> 14:11.360]  I'm alone in this room, right?
[14:11.460 --> 14:12.700]  It's a really small room.
[14:12.780 --> 14:13.220]  It's not that big.
[14:13.300 --> 14:14.500]  There's only one stall for the bathroom.
[14:16.240 --> 14:19.420]  And as I'm taking my shirt off, I hear a guy go,
[14:23.040 --> 14:23.400]  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[14:23.400 --> 14:27.060]  And I go, oh no, I am not alone in this room.
[14:27.220 --> 14:30.980]  And this guy's going through it and I don't smell anything and I'm like, okay,
[14:31.860 --> 14:32.460]  all right.
[14:32.620 --> 14:34.360]  And I just thought like, I should get dressed.
[14:34.460 --> 14:36.640]  I should, you know, undress quickly and put this robe on.
[14:36.640 --> 14:38.680]  And I'm just getting undressed and throwing stuff in.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.420]  And I'm just hearing like...
[14:41.160 --> 14:42.360]  plop, plop, plop.
[14:42.380 --> 14:44.100]  This guy is going through it.
[14:44.280 --> 14:47.480]  He's having a major event in the toilet.
[14:48.180 --> 14:49.640]  And so I'm like...
[14:49.640 --> 14:51.740]  pretty uncomfortable, because this is a pretty small bathroom.
[14:52.080 --> 14:55.620]  And I feel like I'm three feet away from a guy who's dumping out his kidneys.
[14:56.480 --> 14:58.380]  And so I go...
[14:58.380 --> 14:59.400]  I'm like, ugh, fucks.
[14:59.460 --> 15:01.500]  And I'm just shoving stuff in the locker.
[15:02.020 --> 15:03.840]  And I don't understand how the lock works.
[15:04.240 --> 15:05.700]  And so I just slam it shut.
[15:05.700 --> 15:06.900]  And I'm like, fuck this, I'm getting out of here.
[15:06.940 --> 15:09.940]  And as I'm getting out of here, I hear the guy go...
[15:09.940 --> 15:10.480]  Aw, shit!
[15:12.240 --> 15:12.800]  Aw, shit!
[15:13.660 --> 15:15.020]  Like at the top of his voice.
[15:15.160 --> 15:16.760]  And I go, oh no.
[15:17.220 --> 15:19.580]  I get the fuck out of there. I don't know what that is.
[15:19.640 --> 15:21.380]  I don't want to know. I don't want to be in the room.
[15:21.480 --> 15:22.960]  I don't want to smell it when it happens.
[15:23.200 --> 15:25.700]  I just get out of there, and I go sit down in the waiting area.
[15:25.820 --> 15:27.380]  And Emily comes out a few seconds later.
[15:27.720 --> 15:29.900]  And I tell her, kind of whisper the story to her.
[15:29.980 --> 15:31.180]  And we both just start laughing.
[15:31.680 --> 15:33.240]  We're laughing and laughing and laughing.
[15:33.240 --> 15:35.460]  And not too long later, this woman,
[15:35.600 --> 15:37.720]  this older woman, comes out of the women's bathroom.
[15:37.920 --> 15:39.940]  And she's all dressed. She's got a dress on.
[15:40.140 --> 15:41.820]  And like, her hair is done nice.
[15:41.920 --> 15:43.600]  And she's got earrings and jewelry on and stuff.
[15:43.940 --> 15:45.520]  Clearly it's taken her a while to get dressed.
[15:45.720 --> 15:47.220]  And I immediately clock it and go like,
[15:47.300 --> 15:49.420]  Oh, I bet she's the wife,
[15:49.500 --> 15:51.440]  or the significant other of the dude
[15:51.440 --> 15:53.300]  who's shitting his brains out
[15:53.300 --> 15:54.500]  in the other bathroom.
[15:55.220 --> 15:57.720]  And so we start to get a little quiet, you know.
[15:57.840 --> 15:58.940]  And I just keep thinking like,
[15:59.020 --> 16:01.740]  I hope they come to get us before this guy walks out the door.
[16:01.740 --> 16:03.660]  Because I don't want to see what made those noises.
[16:03.660 --> 16:05.000]  I don't want anything to do with it.
[16:06.320 --> 16:07.960]  And we're just trying not to laugh.
[16:08.220 --> 16:09.360]  And we just keep looking at each other.
[16:09.680 --> 16:10.980]  It's one of those things that every time we look at each other,
[16:11.040 --> 16:12.340]  we just start fucking busting out laughing.
[16:12.500 --> 16:15.180]  And we're trying not to be too disruptive to the lady
[16:15.180 --> 16:18.160]  who's enjoying her post-massage or whatever.
[16:19.240 --> 16:19.800]  And then,
[16:21.320 --> 16:22.180]  I asked Emily,
[16:22.640 --> 16:23.240]  I was trying to say something,
[16:23.360 --> 16:24.680]  and I go, Did you lock your locker?
[16:24.780 --> 16:26.100]  And she's like, Yeah, I locked my locker. Why?
[16:26.240 --> 16:28.400]  And I was like, Oh, I don't know how to do it. I couldn't figure it out.
[16:28.400 --> 16:29.520]  And I was trying to get out of there in a hurry.
[16:30.100 --> 16:31.980]  And she's like, They didn't tell you how to lock it?
[16:32.160 --> 16:34.280]  They just showed me. And they didn't show me.
[16:34.320 --> 16:36.100]  It was a lady, so she didn't go into the bathroom with me.
[16:36.140 --> 16:37.300]  She just opened the door and I walked in.
[16:37.660 --> 16:40.480]  And so Emily told me how to lock it. And I thought, Well, my phone is in there.
[16:40.880 --> 16:42.700]  Well, yeah, my phone is in there and a bunch of other stuff.
[16:42.940 --> 16:43.380]  Oh, no.
[16:43.480 --> 16:46.660]  And so I'll just run in there and lock it real fast.
[16:46.680 --> 16:48.000]  Because this guy has not come out.
[16:48.420 --> 16:50.480]  But I also think like, you know, the paranoid part
[16:50.480 --> 16:52.600]  of me is like, This guy's been in there like a half an hour.
[16:52.760 --> 16:54.400]  Is he just going through my wallet right now?
[16:54.620 --> 16:56.200]  You know? So I run in there
[16:56.200 --> 16:58.200]  and I
[16:58.880 --> 17:00.160]  don't see the guy. I open the door
[17:00.160 --> 17:01.280]  and there's nobody in there. And I think, That's weird.
[17:01.380 --> 17:03.640]  And then I hear the shower going. I realize that I'm hearing water.
[17:03.820 --> 17:05.760]  And he's taking a fucking shower.
[17:06.100 --> 17:07.700]  And so I lock my wall lock. I get out of there.
[17:07.740 --> 17:10.280]  And I go tell Emily, It was so bad. He shit himself.
[17:10.380 --> 17:11.080]  He had to take a shower.
[17:11.560 --> 17:13.300]  That's why he was screaming, Shit, oh shit.
[17:13.540 --> 17:16.300]  He must have shit all over himself.
[17:16.480 --> 17:17.820]  And his only recourse
[17:17.820 --> 17:19.700]  is to take a fucking shower now.
[17:20.060 --> 17:22.320]  And this poor woman has been out there for 15 minutes
[17:22.320 --> 17:24.120]  waiting on him. And this dude is now in the shower.
[17:24.120 --> 17:25.680]  And you figure, you know,
[17:25.840 --> 17:28.200]  guys typically get dressed pretty fucking fast, right?
[17:28.260 --> 17:30.220]  In the grand scheme of things. So he's probably been
[17:30.220 --> 17:32.100]  in there a while and she's just waiting.
[17:32.300 --> 17:33.040]  And I feel terrible.
[17:33.620 --> 17:35.980]  Because this guy's clearly going through it.
[17:36.180 --> 17:38.280]  And clearly having to wash the shit
[17:38.280 --> 17:40.340]  off of his body from his explosive diarrhea
[17:40.340 --> 17:41.200]  or whatever it was.
[17:41.720 --> 17:44.360]  So I go back out and I whisper to Emily and we start laughing again.
[17:44.440 --> 17:46.160]  And then they come and get us. And then we have
[17:46.160 --> 17:47.960]  a massage in the same room. Normal,
[17:48.060 --> 17:49.500]  bog standard massage. It was fine.
[17:50.780 --> 17:52.100]  B minus massage.
[17:52.100 --> 17:53.900]  It was okay. But the whole time
[17:53.900 --> 17:56.180]  I'm just trying not to laugh because all I can hear
[17:56.180 --> 17:57.780]  in my head is that guy go
[17:57.780 --> 18:00.240]  AW SHIT! AW SHIT!
[18:00.640 --> 18:02.160]  Over and over and over again. And I'm just like
[18:02.160 --> 18:04.100]  giggling to myself. I think the lady thinks I'm
[18:04.100 --> 18:05.280]  ticklish. I'm not, you know.
[18:05.860 --> 18:08.020]  And as soon as... it's like an 80 minute massage.
[18:08.200 --> 18:10.080]  So as soon as the massage is over, Emily and I are
[18:10.080 --> 18:12.080]  walking back. We look at each other and I'm like
[18:12.080 --> 18:13.540]  how was the massage? And she's like eh...
[18:13.540 --> 18:16.140]  And we just start laughing. We just start laughing again about the
[18:16.140 --> 18:18.120]  dude who took the dump. And we laugh
[18:18.120 --> 18:20.240]  all the way back. We get back to that common area
[18:20.240 --> 18:22.280]  and we sit down and they come and they bring us our
[18:22.280 --> 18:24.080]  water and they say, you know, drink this water.
[18:24.320 --> 18:26.280]  Don't put your clothes on yet. Continue to stay.
[18:26.340 --> 18:27.580]  Stay here as long as you want. Relax.
[18:28.640 --> 18:30.400]  Detoxify. Enjoy being
[18:30.400 --> 18:32.160]  here. Don't be in a hurry to get out of here, you know.
[18:32.200 --> 18:34.340]  You want to like, I don't know, settle before you leave.
[18:34.680 --> 18:36.400]  And so we're sitting there and
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.220]  we're just laughing. We're literally
[18:38.220 --> 18:40.140]  still joking and laughing about the guy
[18:40.140 --> 18:42.280]  screaming shit oh shit. We just keep saying it to each
[18:42.280 --> 18:44.260]  other over and over again. And out of the
[18:44.260 --> 18:46.120]  blue, my stomach
[18:47.180 --> 18:47.500]  goes...
[18:48.100 --> 18:49.460]  No! And Emily goes,
[18:49.620 --> 18:51.340]  oh my god, what was that? And I go,
[18:51.940 --> 18:53.620]  uh... and I get hit with a cramp
[18:53.620 --> 18:55.060]  and I go, uh, I'll be right back.
[18:55.280 --> 18:56.460]  And I run into the bathroom
[18:57.140 --> 18:59.440]  and I barely get the toilet
[18:59.440 --> 19:01.020]  door, like the stall door open.
[19:01.340 --> 19:02.980]  Turn around, pull my pants down.
[19:03.200 --> 19:05.420]  The second I'm hovering over the bowl
[19:05.420 --> 19:07.480]  before I even touch, a shotgun
[19:07.480 --> 19:09.300]  of diarrhea comes out of me. Like,
[19:10.080 --> 19:11.560]  kaboom! And I go
[19:11.560 --> 19:11.980]  oh!
[19:13.480 --> 19:15.360]  And it's like I'm getting hit with instant
[19:15.360 --> 19:17.240]  karma and I've become
[19:17.240 --> 19:19.300]  the guy. I don't think it's karma.
[19:19.500 --> 19:21.340]  I think it's a time loop. I think you
[19:21.340 --> 19:23.220]  were putting your thing in the
[19:23.220 --> 19:25.340]  locker as it was happening. Oh no! I was
[19:25.340 --> 19:27.640]  the guy in the shower and I never... It was you the whole time!
[19:27.880 --> 19:29.100]  That never crossed my mind.
[19:29.660 --> 19:31.040]  Well, I diverted the timeline
[19:31.040 --> 19:33.600]  a little bit. So anyway, I'm like, uh...
[19:33.600 --> 19:35.440]  And then I have like two or three
[19:35.440 --> 19:36.840]  more shotgun blasts. Just
[19:38.400 --> 19:39.280]  heinous. Stinky
[19:39.280 --> 19:41.420]  and terrible. And I was normal.
[19:41.800 --> 19:42.940]  I was feeling normal.
[19:42.940 --> 19:45.100]  I didn't have any weird food
[19:45.100 --> 19:47.080]  or anything. And I'm
[19:47.080 --> 19:48.440]  like, oh god! And
[19:48.840 --> 19:51.100]  in my head I'm like, well the only saving grace is I haven't
[19:51.100 --> 19:52.900]  shit all over myself, you know? So I
[19:52.900 --> 19:54.520]  clean up. And it's a
[19:55.060 --> 19:56.740]  bad duty, but it's not...
[19:56.740 --> 19:58.880]  I didn't explore it on myself, right?
[19:59.020 --> 20:00.960]  I don't need to take a shower. I'm like, the one
[20:00.960 --> 20:02.960]  thing I'm hanging on to is I'm definitely not taking a
[20:02.960 --> 20:04.200]  shower right now. That's no big deal.
[20:04.920 --> 20:06.860]  And I get up and I flush the
[20:06.860 --> 20:08.840]  toilet. And I go,
[20:09.080 --> 20:09.740]  oh shit.
[20:10.580 --> 20:11.540]  The toilet
[20:12.860 --> 20:13.860]  works at like
[20:13.860 --> 20:15.740]  I'm gonna say 18%
[20:15.740 --> 20:17.780]  toilet level. You found the old shit.
[20:18.060 --> 20:19.620]  I found the old shit. And so
[20:19.620 --> 20:20.640]  I've dropped
[20:22.500 --> 20:23.840]  bull and cow
[20:23.840 --> 20:25.880]  and donkey shit at this thing. Like I've
[20:25.880 --> 20:27.720]  made a mound and it's like
[20:27.720 --> 20:29.520]  siphoning off little bits.
[20:29.860 --> 20:31.560]  And it takes like a full minute
[20:31.560 --> 20:33.760]  for this thing to fill back up. And if you try
[20:33.760 --> 20:35.720]  to search that circuit and do it early, there's
[20:35.720 --> 20:37.700]  no like half power. It just drains the water and
[20:37.700 --> 20:39.520]  nothing goes out. I have to, I
[20:39.520 --> 20:41.600]  flushed 8 times.
[20:42.080 --> 20:43.560]  Ugh. And I
[20:43.560 --> 20:45.040]  still had about
[20:45.560 --> 20:46.800]  20% of the
[20:47.700 --> 20:49.320]  fish flakes left in the bowl, right?
[20:49.680 --> 20:51.180]  And I don't know what to do.
[20:51.420 --> 20:52.760]  I just can't
[20:53.560 --> 20:56.020]  I was hoping we'd get to that. I can't
[20:56.020 --> 20:57.760]  make it go away. And I've
[20:57.760 --> 20:59.560]  been in there for like 15 minutes
[20:59.560 --> 21:01.420]  now. And I'm like, the only thing I'm thinking is like
[21:01.900 --> 21:03.620]  I'm gonna come out and Emily's gonna be
[21:03.620 --> 21:05.680]  completely dressed and waiting on me going, what the
[21:05.680 --> 21:07.740]  fuck is going on? Why'd you take so
[21:07.740 --> 21:09.480]  long, right? And uh
[21:09.480 --> 21:11.880]  and I just, I gave up.
[21:12.180 --> 21:13.840]  I just, I didn't know what else to do.
[21:14.160 --> 21:15.820]  I tried and I tried and I tried and I
[21:15.820 --> 21:17.840]  tried and I got almost all of the
[21:17.840 --> 21:19.800]  duty down. But some of it just
[21:19.800 --> 21:21.700]  wouldn't go. And all I could think of is like
[21:21.700 --> 21:23.260]  this is a known problem for them.
[21:23.620 --> 21:25.640]  This happens every day. They're the
[21:25.640 --> 21:27.460]  ones, they should fix their fucking toilet.
[21:27.820 --> 21:29.300]  They gotta expect this is happening.
[21:29.540 --> 21:31.200]  And I feel so terrible, but I just like
[21:31.200 --> 21:33.280]  I just left the bathroom
[21:33.280 --> 21:35.200]  and I walked outside and
[21:35.200 --> 21:37.320]  Emily hasn't moved. She's still in
[21:37.320 --> 21:38.900]  her robe and her eyes
[21:38.900 --> 21:41.300]  are like the size of dinner plates and she's
[21:41.300 --> 21:42.960]  just looking at me. And I go, hey.
[21:43.200 --> 21:44.880]  And she goes, I heard it all.
[21:45.140 --> 21:45.880]  I heard everything.
[21:47.520 --> 21:48.800]  She heard my
[21:48.800 --> 21:51.160]  shit was so loud she heard my
[21:51.160 --> 21:53.040]  poops. She heard me moaning.
[21:53.560 --> 21:55.260]  She heard me saying shit to myself.
[21:55.540 --> 21:57.520]  She heard me flushing the toilet eight times.
[21:57.920 --> 21:59.260]  And then, so I explained the story
[21:59.260 --> 22:01.340]  to her and then she has to
[22:01.340 --> 22:03.260]  leave and go get dressed after she laughs at me
[22:03.260 --> 22:05.340]  for like a half an hour. So then I'm sitting in there
[22:05.340 --> 22:07.320]  and I'm just waiting for her to get dressed and the
[22:07.320 --> 22:09.280]  entire time I'm like, please don't let a guy walk into that
[22:09.280 --> 22:11.040]  bathroom. Please don't let a guy walk into that bathroom.
[22:11.360 --> 22:13.080]  Please don't let him see what's in there. You know, please
[22:13.080 --> 22:15.260]  let us just get out of here. And then finally she
[22:15.260 --> 22:17.240]  came out and we got out of there and I can never
[22:17.240 --> 22:18.400]  go back to that place again.
[22:22.440 --> 22:23.080]  Relaxing massage.
[22:24.300 --> 22:25.260]  Relaxing massage on a set.
[22:25.280 --> 22:27.140]  Yeah, did it really bring you down?
[22:27.320 --> 22:28.840]  Really calm you? No.
[22:28.840 --> 22:30.640]  Yeah. Perfect.
[22:31.080 --> 22:32.960]  So you picked like laxative instead
[22:32.960 --> 22:34.180]  of lavender as the phrase?
[22:36.940 --> 22:38.780]  I don't know if it was
[22:38.780 --> 22:41.100]  some sort of a shit-atsu massage
[22:41.100 --> 22:42.760]  that I was not familiar with or something.
[22:43.240 --> 22:44.640]  But god damn dude,
[22:44.800 --> 22:46.340]  it was something about that place
[22:46.920 --> 22:48.820]  clears you out. You had
[22:48.820 --> 22:50.920]  some knots in areas you did not expect.
[22:51.180 --> 22:52.880]  You got denotted in the
[22:52.880 --> 22:54.900]  worst way. All I could think
[22:54.900 --> 22:56.960]  of the whole time is like, I've done this to myself.
[22:56.960 --> 22:58.580]  I made fun of the guy too much.
[22:58.800 --> 23:00.840]  I crossed a threshold, like an invisible
[23:00.840 --> 23:02.960]  universal threshold and now I'm
[23:02.960 --> 23:04.960]  paying the price for it. I shouldn't have laughed that
[23:04.960 --> 23:07.140]  hard, you know? And yeah, there you go.
[23:07.480 --> 23:08.580]  That's my Saturday.
[23:08.660 --> 23:10.580]  That's amazing. Oh my god.
[23:10.600 --> 23:13.080]  I'm so sorry. So was it overall
[23:13.080 --> 23:14.940]  did you come away less
[23:14.940 --> 23:16.540]  relaxed than before you went in? Yeah.
[23:16.700 --> 23:18.120]  It definitely was worse for wear.
[23:18.860 --> 23:20.880]  100%. I mean, I was lighter. I weigh less.
[23:21.620 --> 23:21.880]  But...
[23:23.580 --> 23:24.540]  But yeah, it was
[23:24.540 --> 23:26.400]  it definitely ruined the
[23:26.400 --> 23:28.120]  effect of the massage pretty quickly.
[23:29.000 --> 23:30.040]  Oh man.
[23:30.780 --> 23:32.000]  That is brutal.
[23:32.600 --> 23:33.940]  Yeah. Yeah.
[23:34.340 --> 23:35.700]  So what's new with y'all?
[23:36.240 --> 23:37.380]  I had a
[23:38.140 --> 23:40.200]  realization with Gavin that has helped me
[23:40.200 --> 23:42.300]  understand him a little bit better. Hell no.
[23:42.380 --> 23:44.600]  Do I know about this? No, you don't know about this.
[23:44.760 --> 23:45.080]  Oh shit.
[23:46.120 --> 23:48.220]  Well you, in the recent episode,
[23:48.620 --> 23:50.000]  you described how your
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.200]  internal thought process goes and
[23:52.200 --> 23:54.260]  it was very foreign to what I
[23:54.260 --> 23:56.100]  experienced. It was tough. Just not very wordy.
[23:56.600 --> 23:58.240]  Yeah, not very wordy. More image based
[23:58.240 --> 24:00.320]  and it's just like so foreign to what
[24:00.320 --> 24:02.240]  I'm used to and like just trying
[24:02.240 --> 24:04.180]  to... I was trying to piece together and I
[24:04.180 --> 24:06.200]  was thinking about it and this isn't going to mean
[24:06.200 --> 24:07.620]  anything to you, Gavin, but it really
[24:08.100 --> 24:10.260]  it helped me put things into perspective
[24:10.260 --> 24:11.260]  of how to view you.
[24:12.480 --> 24:14.200]  You are internally
[24:14.900 --> 24:16.140]  running a Chip Kelly
[24:16.140 --> 24:17.880]  offense is what I realized.
[24:18.200 --> 24:20.280]  You and Chip Kelly, one in the
[24:20.280 --> 24:22.340]  same. Chip Kelly was a college
[24:22.340 --> 24:24.360]  football coach who had a
[24:24.360 --> 24:26.200]  run into the NFL
[24:26.200 --> 24:28.320]  I'd say maybe like seven years ago
[24:28.320 --> 24:30.240]  and his whole thing was
[24:30.240 --> 24:32.400]  what made him unique is instead of
[24:32.400 --> 24:34.340]  doing play calls, they would
[24:34.340 --> 24:36.360]  do images on the sideline to do the play
[24:36.360 --> 24:38.260]  so the players would look at that. That's your
[24:38.260 --> 24:40.220]  brain, Gavin. That is just how I
[24:40.220 --> 24:42.240]  imagine how you function. Chip Kelly
[24:42.240 --> 24:44.360]  also known for a high speed offense
[24:44.360 --> 24:46.120]  you love high speed cameras.
[24:46.500 --> 24:47.700]  It's just one in one.
[24:47.700 --> 24:49.660]  So I'm now thinking of you
[24:50.300 --> 24:51.660]  in the same
[24:51.660 --> 24:53.740]  context as Chip Kelly and it is really
[24:53.740 --> 24:55.620]  just, I feel like I understand you better
[24:55.620 --> 24:57.480]  now. It's not as confusing.
[24:57.980 --> 24:59.300]  I have context for you.
[24:59.500 --> 25:00.760]  And was he alright or was he a wote?
[25:01.420 --> 25:03.840]  He did not last long in the NFL.
[25:04.560 --> 25:05.580]  All of the
[25:05.580 --> 25:07.700]  Chip Kelly experience did not translate.
[25:08.160 --> 25:09.240]  That being said,
[25:09.520 --> 25:11.680]  I believe that process
[25:11.680 --> 25:13.700]  is still adopted today by
[25:13.700 --> 25:15.580]  a lot of teams. A lot of teams will use
[25:15.580 --> 25:17.420]  images now instead of... Yes.
[25:17.720 --> 25:19.500]  So he had a lasting effect.
[25:19.920 --> 25:21.560]  For sure.
[25:21.780 --> 25:23.740]  I'd say Gavin does. I'd say Gavin has a lasting
[25:23.740 --> 25:25.680]  effect. Maybe not as
[25:25.680 --> 25:27.700]  lasting as your shit in that bathroom
[25:27.700 --> 25:28.820]  Geoff, but
[25:29.500 --> 25:31.700]  Gavin stays around. Someone on
[25:31.700 --> 25:33.440]  the F*** Face subreddit
[25:33.440 --> 25:35.260]  Schwifty Oak made a picture
[25:35.260 --> 25:37.620]  inside you there are two wolves
[25:37.620 --> 25:39.540]  so this is Gavin's two wolves. Gavin has
[25:39.540 --> 25:41.420]  two wolves inside him. One stands up
[25:41.420 --> 25:43.500]  and go to bed. The other one
[25:43.500 --> 25:44.820]  has an external monologue.
[25:45.040 --> 25:46.880]  They posted it and then
[25:47.240 --> 25:49.560]  they had barely only reply
[25:49.560 --> 25:51.600]  on their thread and they just said
[25:51.600 --> 25:52.920]  internal monologue.
[25:53.380 --> 25:55.640]  And it was...
[25:56.600 --> 25:57.280]  Everything
[25:58.120 --> 25:59.620]  about it's a mess.
[26:00.000 --> 26:00.920]  And I think it's been
[26:01.260 --> 26:03.440]  making me laugh. It's been making me
[26:03.440 --> 26:05.420]  laugh all day
[26:05.420 --> 26:07.400]  long. One
[26:07.400 --> 26:09.640]  stands up and go to bed
[26:09.640 --> 26:11.280]  and I just keep walking
[26:11.280 --> 26:13.020]  around the house saying it.
[26:13.180 --> 26:15.220]  It's so funny. That's actually
[26:15.220 --> 26:17.360]  pretty accurate because I once again this week
[26:17.360 --> 26:18.460]  tried talking to myself.
[26:19.320 --> 26:21.320]  I tried one thing. I tried
[26:21.320 --> 26:22.580]  to say one thing and it didn't
[26:23.160 --> 26:24.820]  even come out grammatically correct.
[26:26.020 --> 26:27.140]  What did you say?
[26:27.280 --> 26:28.820]  I had a pile of laundry on the floor
[26:28.820 --> 26:30.940]  and I just walked up to it and
[26:30.940 --> 26:33.140]  exclaimed out loud, tomorrow is
[26:33.140 --> 26:33.580]  chores.
[26:36.300 --> 26:37.340]  That has to be
[26:37.340 --> 26:38.940]  one of the titles for this episode.
[26:38.940 --> 26:40.660]  Tomorrow is chores.
[26:40.800 --> 26:41.880]  I was like oh my god
[26:41.880 --> 26:43.880]  it's not even a sentence.
[26:46.340 --> 26:47.120]  I really
[26:47.120 --> 26:48.360]  don't know how to do it.
[26:49.800 --> 26:50.980]  I've been having a communication
[26:50.980 --> 26:53.020]  nightmare. I've also been having the
[26:53.020 --> 26:54.760]  worst dreams. Like I talk about
[26:55.360 --> 26:56.940]  I've talked about how shit some of my
[26:56.940 --> 26:58.720]  dreams are in the past where I just dream about
[26:58.720 --> 27:00.860]  my nightstand. I just dream about what
[27:00.860 --> 27:02.220]  my head is pointed at in real life.
[27:02.840 --> 27:04.660]  And my cats have just been
[27:04.660 --> 27:06.880]  dicking around a lot recently to the point where
[27:06.880 --> 27:08.960]  I've just started sleeping with my airpods
[27:08.960 --> 27:10.800]  in. I'll just like pop on a YouTube
[27:10.800 --> 27:12.000]  video and
[27:12.680 --> 27:14.900]  listen to something to fall asleep. But it's
[27:14.900 --> 27:16.620]  really making my dreams shit.
[27:16.900 --> 27:18.940]  Because I can't hear what anyone
[27:18.940 --> 27:20.480]  is saying in any of my dreams.
[27:20.980 --> 27:22.480]  And I'm trying to listen and I'm like
[27:23.200 --> 27:24.840]  HUH?! And then I'll pull
[27:24.840 --> 27:26.920]  my airpods out of my ears in the
[27:26.920 --> 27:28.780]  dream and have them in my hand
[27:28.780 --> 27:30.760]  and I can still hear the video. So I'm like
[27:30.760 --> 27:32.960]  OH! NO! NO! SORRY!
[27:33.080 --> 27:33.160]  NO!
[27:34.200 --> 27:35.100]  They're still
[27:35.100 --> 27:37.080]  in my real ears! These are my fake...
[27:37.080 --> 27:39.420]  These are my dream airpods but my real ears
[27:39.420 --> 27:41.420]  still have... So it's like I'm in a lucid
[27:41.420 --> 27:43.300]  dream but I don't do anything
[27:43.300 --> 27:45.200]  interesting other than try to explain
[27:45.200 --> 27:47.080]  that my actual ears
[27:47.880 --> 27:49.200]  still have my airpods in
[27:49.200 --> 27:51.160]  and that's why I can't hear anyone. And I've just
[27:51.160 --> 27:53.680]  had that dream like two or three nights in a row.
[27:54.600 --> 27:55.320]  It's so
[27:55.320 --> 27:57.280]  talk shit. Was there a
[27:57.280 --> 27:59.480]  movie at one point or a
[27:59.480 --> 28:01.180]  entertainment property where
[28:01.180 --> 28:03.040]  there were aliens living on earth
[28:03.040 --> 28:05.120]  as regular humans but they didn't
[28:05.120 --> 28:07.060]  know they were aliens. Like they were asleep
[28:07.060 --> 28:09.180]  and they were just living in like human bodies
[28:09.180 --> 28:11.200]  as vessels. And then at some point
[28:11.200 --> 28:12.900]  it gets activated and they realize they're aliens.
[28:13.020 --> 28:15.060]  I feel like that's you. I feel like
[28:15.060 --> 28:16.960]  if that's actually happening
[28:16.960 --> 28:19.200]  I think you're just an alien doing
[28:19.200 --> 28:21.180]  your best in a human body and you
[28:21.180 --> 28:23.320]  just... you haven't been... you're a super agent
[28:23.320 --> 28:25.440]  that hasn't been awoken by the mothership
[28:25.440 --> 28:26.980]  yet. Uh...
[28:26.980 --> 28:29.240]  It's possible. I mean I'm definitely unaware of it if that's
[28:29.240 --> 28:30.200]  the case. Yeah.
[28:31.080 --> 28:33.380]  I just... I'm just so frustrated that
[28:33.380 --> 28:35.260]  I'm aware that I'm dreaming and it doesn't
[28:35.260 --> 28:36.700]  even break the dream.
[28:38.220 --> 28:39.180]  Like I'm there telling
[28:39.180 --> 28:40.420]  people that like...
[28:40.860 --> 28:43.340]  I'd love to listen to them. Like I know it's not
[28:43.340 --> 28:45.300]  worth listening to. But I'm still trying
[28:45.300 --> 28:47.240]  to like be polite to them. I don't know what's going on.
[28:48.280 --> 28:48.700]  Oh.
[28:49.480 --> 28:51.240]  I... I love you so
[28:51.240 --> 28:52.860]  much. You...
[28:53.340 --> 28:55.320]  It must be so boring to be
[28:55.320 --> 28:56.080]  you sometimes.
[28:56.080 --> 28:57.340]  Why?
[28:58.180 --> 29:00.140]  Just boring dreams. You got
[29:00.140 --> 29:02.160]  nobody to talk to when you're alone. You can't
[29:02.160 --> 29:04.180]  even talk to yourself. You dream
[29:04.180 --> 29:06.200]  about dreaming. You can't
[29:06.200 --> 29:07.820]  like just...
[29:07.820 --> 29:08.600]  Oh man.
[29:14.590 --> 29:16.350]  Crystal clear waters.
[29:16.950 --> 29:18.030]  White sandy beaches.
[29:18.990 --> 29:20.370]  Tropical drinks with little
[29:20.370 --> 29:22.510]  umbrellas. Stress doesn't
[29:22.510 --> 29:24.510]  exist here. But it could back
[29:24.510 --> 29:26.590]  at home where an undetected water leak
[29:26.590 --> 29:28.510]  can turn into costly water damage.
[29:29.330 --> 29:30.730]  But with Moen Flow

[29:32.810 --> 29:34.690]  worries. It detects leaks

[30:16.670 --> 30:18.830]  The roses were living the dream. More champagne
[30:18.830 --> 30:20.870]  for me, please. Until it all came
[30:20.870 --> 30:22.770]  crashing down. You got fired.
[30:22.890 --> 30:24.790]  Fired? From the director of
[30:24.790 --> 30:26.850]  Meet the Parents. You're a failure. Women don't like
[30:26.850 --> 30:28.730]  that. If you need a shoulder or an
[30:28.730 --> 30:29.850]  inner thigh to lean on.
[30:30.250 --> 30:32.830]  On August 29th. I just want the house.
[30:33.010 --> 30:35.030]  We want everything. Wow. Stop.
[30:35.170 --> 30:36.590]  Yes, stop! And see
[30:36.590 --> 30:38.810]  the roses. These people.
[30:39.150 --> 30:40.550]  The Roses. Rated R.
[30:40.650 --> 30:42.170]  Under 17, not admitted without parent.
[30:42.410 --> 30:44.350]  In theaters everywhere August 29th.

[32:26.750 --> 32:28.510]  What do you call a person who
[32:28.510 --> 32:29.770]  speaks three languages?
[32:30.350 --> 32:32.330]  Trilingual. Someone who speaks
[32:32.330 --> 32:33.750]  two? Bilingual.
[32:34.550 --> 32:36.590]  Someone who speaks one? American.
[32:37.230 --> 32:38.370]  Only 22% of
[32:38.370 --> 32:40.510]  Americans speak a language other than English
[32:40.510 --> 32:42.310]  at home. Start learning a new
[32:42.310 --> 32:44.290]  language this fall and be the exception,
[32:44.290 --> 32:46.230]  not the rule. Because with Babbel,
[32:46.570 --> 32:48.150]  you start speaking a new language
[32:48.150 --> 32:49.610]  in just three weeks.
[32:50.310 --> 32:52.350]  This fall, you can start speaking a new language
[32:52.350 --> 32:54.110]  with Babbel. Why Babbel?
[32:54.330 --> 32:56.230]  Because it works. Instead of
[32:56.230 --> 32:58.290]  paying hundreds of dollars for a private tutor
[32:58.290 --> 33:00.230]  or fooling yourself with language apps
[33:00.230 --> 33:01.610]  that are little more than games,
[33:02.050 --> 33:04.150]  Babbel's quick 10-minute lessons are designed by
[33:04.150 --> 33:05.930]  over 150 language experts
[33:05.930 --> 33:08.490]  to help you start speaking a new language
[33:08.490 --> 33:10.310]  in as little as three weeks.
[33:10.930 --> 33:12.290]  Babbel is designed by
[33:12.290 --> 33:14.230]  real people for real conversations.
[33:14.750 --> 33:16.290]  All of Babbel's tips and tools for
[33:16.290 --> 33:17.930]  learning a new language are approachable,
[33:18.310 --> 33:20.210]  accessible, rooted in real-life
[33:20.210 --> 33:22.210]  situations, and delivered with
[33:22.210 --> 33:23.870]  conversation-based teaching.
[33:24.630 --> 33:26.410]  Babbel's courses are so helpful
[33:26.410 --> 33:28.410]  because they help you learn real-life
[33:28.410 --> 33:30.430]  conversation skills. It's so
[33:30.430 --> 33:32.310]  easy to pick up on things like ordering
[33:32.310 --> 33:33.790]  food, asking for directions,
[33:34.290 --> 33:36.290]  speaking to merchants, without having to consult
[33:36.290 --> 33:38.410]  language apps while on vacation, which is something
[33:38.410 --> 33:40.430]  that will take you out of that experience
[33:40.430 --> 33:42.170]  and just makes it more difficult.
[33:42.310 --> 33:43.990]  I mean, if I'm in France, you know,
[33:44.110 --> 33:46.390]  bonjour, saying hello to some
[33:46.390 --> 33:46.810]  people.
[33:48.170 --> 33:50.150]  You want it to be clear.
[33:50.270 --> 33:52.190]  You don't want to have to look at an app to say something
[33:52.190 --> 33:53.210]  as basic as hello.
[33:54.010 --> 33:56.550]  Studies from Yale, Michigan State University,
[33:56.810 --> 33:58.110]  and others continue to prove
[33:58.110 --> 34:00.010]  Babbel is better. For instance,
[34:00.150 --> 34:02.210]  one study found that using Babbel for 15
[34:02.210 --> 34:04.310]  hours is equivalent to a full semester
[34:04.310 --> 34:06.210]  at college. With
[34:06.210 --> 34:08.130]  over 10 million subscriptions sold,
[34:08.130 --> 34:10.030]  Babbel is real language learning
[34:10.030 --> 34:11.330]  for real conversations.

[34:44.610 --> 34:45.990]  No, we're talking about our sponsor
[34:45.990 --> 34:48.090]  Fume, and how they look at the problem in
[34:48.090 --> 34:50.070]  a different way. Not everything
[34:50.070 --> 34:52.110]  in a bad habit is wrong, so instead of a
[34:52.110 --> 34:54.090]  drastic and comfortable change, why
[34:54.090 --> 34:56.010]  not just remove the bad from your habit?
[34:56.650 --> 34:58.250]  Fume is an innovative, award
[34:58.250 --> 35:00.350]  nominated device that does just that.
[35:00.770 --> 35:01.770]  Instead of electronics,
[35:02.050 --> 35:04.070]  Fume is completely natural. Instead
[35:04.070 --> 35:06.230]  of vapor, Fume uses flavored air.
[35:06.690 --> 35:08.210]  And instead of harmful chemicals,
[35:08.710 --> 35:10.190]  Fume uses all natural
[35:10.190 --> 35:12.270]  delicious flavors. You get it.
[35:12.550 --> 35:14.350]  Instead of bad, Fume is good.
[35:14.630 --> 35:16.170]  It's a habit you're free to enjoy
[35:16.170 --> 35:18.410]  and makes replacing your bad habit easy.
[35:18.970 --> 35:20.370]  Your Fume comes with an adjustable
[35:20.370 --> 35:22.310]  airflow dial and is designed
[35:22.310 --> 35:24.270]  with movable parts and magnets
[35:24.270 --> 35:26.310]  for fidgeting, giving your fingers
[35:26.310 --> 35:28.390]  a lot to do which is helpful for de-stressing
[35:28.390 --> 35:30.210]  and anxiety while breaking your habits.
[35:30.750 --> 35:32.370]  Another just great thing about
[35:32.370 --> 35:34.050]  Fume is how it looks. It's beautiful,
[35:34.190 --> 35:36.070]  the real wood and the shape. It's awesome.
[35:36.190 --> 35:38.150]  It's something that you could really feel cool using.
[35:39.150 --> 35:40.390]  Stopping is something we all
[35:40.390 --> 35:42.350]  put off because it's hard, but switching
[35:42.350 --> 35:44.290]  to Fume is easy, enjoyable, and
[35:44.290 --> 35:46.250]  even fun. Fume has served over
[35:46.250 --> 35:48.070]  100,000 customers and has
[35:48.070 --> 35:50.210]  thousands of success stories, and there's
[35:50.210 --> 35:51.670]  no reason that can't be you.
[35:52.270 --> 35:54.210]  Join Fume in accelerating humanity's
[35:54.210 --> 35:56.170]  breakup from destructive habits by

[36:13.710 --> 36:14.170]  I
[36:14.170 --> 36:16.270]  sent Gavin a clip
[36:16.270 --> 36:18.310]  of me talking to my- like I was just starting
[36:18.310 --> 36:20.150]  talking to myself and I thought, oh, I'll just
[36:20.150 --> 36:22.210]  record this and do, like, what I would have
[36:22.210 --> 36:24.390]  done without recording it. And he refused
[36:24.390 --> 36:25.610]  to believe that it was real.
[36:26.010 --> 36:27.410]  He was like, this is not...
[36:27.410 --> 36:29.950]  You said more stuff
[36:29.950 --> 36:31.530]  in five minutes than I say in a week.
[36:33.890 --> 36:35.770]  It was like a six minute thing
[36:35.770 --> 36:37.750]  of I was just monologuing to myself, but I was by
[36:37.750 --> 36:39.810]  myself, I was alone, so I was just
[36:39.810 --> 36:41.650]  filling time. It was all full
[36:41.650 --> 36:43.810]  grammatical sentences as well. I was impressed.
[36:44.850 --> 36:45.730]  Maybe, maybe
[36:45.730 --> 36:47.870]  words are finite and we only
[36:47.870 --> 36:49.930]  have so many that we can say, and Andrew
[36:49.930 --> 36:51.830]  and I will someday run out and Gavin
[36:51.830 --> 36:53.490]  will still be going strong.
[36:54.250 --> 36:55.870]  Gavin is gonna reach age
[36:55.870 --> 36:57.750]  250 and you and I are gonna
[36:57.750 --> 36:58.830]  be dead by 60.
[36:59.250 --> 37:02.010]  He is extending that mileage.
[37:03.670 --> 37:05.750]  We are not gonna last nearly as long.
[37:06.210 --> 37:07.650]  It's gonna be a different kind of podcast
[37:07.650 --> 37:09.950]  after we die. So the lonelier you are,
[37:10.870 --> 37:11.950]  the lonelier you
[37:11.950 --> 37:13.890]  get? Because all my friends will be
[37:13.890 --> 37:14.610]  dead.
[37:18.490 --> 37:20.850]  You're going to start the beginning, the
[37:20.850 --> 37:22.850]  first five years of your life are in
[37:22.850 --> 37:24.790]  total silence, and the last five are
[37:24.790 --> 37:26.790]  also gonna be in total silence. Maybe,
[37:26.790 --> 37:28.370]  you guys remember Highlander?
[37:28.690 --> 37:30.550]  Maybe Highlanders weren't actually
[37:30.550 --> 37:32.490]  immortal. Maybe they just didn't talk enough.
[37:33.630 --> 37:34.850]  They just outlived
[37:34.850 --> 37:35.390]  everybody.
[37:36.890 --> 37:38.550]  That's a real dog shit movie, that one.
[37:38.690 --> 37:40.070]  I love it. Thousand Words?
[37:40.390 --> 37:42.570]  Never heard of it. I never watched it.
[37:42.930 --> 37:43.650]  It's cursed.
[37:44.330 --> 37:46.590]  Well, Eric just posted a movie
[37:46.590 --> 37:48.610]  poster for A Thousand Words, which is an
[37:48.610 --> 37:50.610]  Eddie Murphy movie. A Thousand Words.
[37:50.730 --> 37:52.610]  A fast-talking agent can only speak
[37:52.610 --> 37:54.750]  1,000 more words before
[37:54.750 --> 37:56.770]  he dies in this
[37:56.770 --> 37:58.850]  feel-good comedy starring
[37:58.850 --> 37:59.690]  Eddie Murphy.
[38:03.890 --> 38:04.690]  That just
[38:04.690 --> 38:06.610]  sounds like a contract negotiation
[38:06.610 --> 38:08.730]  that became a movie plot. He's like, I just don't want
[38:08.730 --> 38:09.410]  that many lines.
[38:10.750 --> 38:12.230]  I don't want to say that much in this movie.
[38:12.970 --> 38:14.430]  It's very front-loaded, that script.
[38:15.130 --> 38:15.370]  Yeah.
[38:16.690 --> 38:18.410]  So does he end up just in silence?
[38:18.850 --> 38:20.690]  I'm sure that he reverses
[38:20.690 --> 38:22.630]  the curse in some way. I'm sure
[38:22.630 --> 38:24.710]  he learns an important life lesson, right?
[38:24.930 --> 38:26.250]  Yes, absolutely.
[38:26.570 --> 38:28.590]  Hey, which Highlander is a
[38:28.590 --> 38:30.870]  dogshit movie? The original with Rucker Hauer
[38:30.870 --> 38:31.810]  and Christopher Lambert?
[38:32.350 --> 38:34.550]  Rucker Hauer is in that movie? The original, he's
[38:34.550 --> 38:36.010]  the bad guy. Oh, yeah.
[38:37.150 --> 38:38.470]  I remember Clancy Brown.
[38:39.190 --> 38:39.990]  There's a...
[38:39.990 --> 38:42.770]  There was a TV show and there was a couple of remakes,
[38:42.910 --> 38:44.370]  but I think the original was a pretty good movie.
[38:44.530 --> 38:46.310]  I mean, I haven't seen this since I was a kid, but...
[38:46.310 --> 38:48.310]  It's like shit good. It's not
[38:48.310 --> 38:49.070]  good good.
[38:49.930 --> 38:50.390]  Yeah.
[38:50.590 --> 38:51.410]  Watch it now.
[38:52.290 --> 38:53.910]  Was Highlander 2 any good?
[38:54.550 --> 38:55.610]  No, I don't think so.
[38:55.690 --> 38:57.390]  Maybe that's what you're thinking of.
[38:58.130 --> 39:00.930]  Isn't that the movies where they kept making sequels, but all the
[39:00.930 --> 39:02.230]  sequels were to the first movie?
[39:02.490 --> 39:05.030]  That sounds right. I don't think they should be allowed to do that.
[39:05.030 --> 39:05.670]  I hate that.
[39:05.890 --> 39:09.150]  I think Mario Van Peebles was involved at some point, right?
[39:09.310 --> 39:10.870]  Was he in a... Yeah, that sounds right.
[39:11.850 --> 39:13.090]  Maybe one of the remakes.
[39:13.370 --> 39:14.370]  Solo himself?
[39:16.270 --> 39:17.070]  I'll say it's
[39:17.070 --> 39:18.530]  no blast, that's for sure.
[39:18.610 --> 39:20.110]  Oh, we gotta watch Blast!
[39:20.490 --> 39:21.570]  Slop that in the calendar.
[39:22.910 --> 39:25.410]  Has anyone explored more Little Hobo?
[39:25.550 --> 39:27.230]  The Littlest Hobo since watching it?
[39:27.290 --> 39:27.830]  You go deep?
[39:28.230 --> 39:29.750]  Geoff, you seen all season one?
[39:30.530 --> 39:33.190]  No, but I did see the new version of it
[39:33.190 --> 39:34.470]  you sent me, which looks pretty exciting.
[39:34.690 --> 39:35.890]  Simon and Rex? Yeah.
[39:36.070 --> 39:39.030]  I love that there's always a dog show in Canada, it seems.
[39:39.170 --> 39:40.950]  There's always a dog doing something
[39:40.950 --> 39:41.570]  for someone.
[39:42.010 --> 39:44.750]  Do you think Canadians just appreciate
[39:44.750 --> 39:46.190]  dogs more than Americans do?
[39:47.430 --> 39:48.650]  Uh, I hope so.
[39:48.930 --> 39:50.170]  That'd be a great thing to claim.
[39:50.710 --> 39:52.230]  What? Didn't we have Rin Tin Tin?
[39:53.410 --> 39:54.410]  That was like...
[39:54.410 --> 39:56.210]  That was like a whole thing.
[39:56.490 --> 39:57.710]  That's a Christmas song.
[39:58.230 --> 40:00.370]  There was like
[40:00.370 --> 40:01.890]  Wishbone and stuff as well, right?
[40:01.990 --> 40:03.870]  We had Boomer, we had Benji.
[40:04.110 --> 40:06.050]  We've had a pretty rich history.
[40:06.330 --> 40:08.230]  Snoopy, yeah, and Snoopy.
[40:08.830 --> 40:09.530]  Think about Snoopy.
[40:09.670 --> 40:12.310]  We're talking fake dogs, you got Scooby Doo, you got Snoopy.
[40:12.310 --> 40:14.010]  We could have a whole fake dog draft.
[40:14.010 --> 40:14.830]  Clifford might be Canadian.
[40:15.130 --> 40:18.010]  Dog draft. Oh, you know, we also had
[40:18.010 --> 40:18.790]  Turner and Hooch.
[40:19.670 --> 40:21.990]  Now that I'm, man, fuck Canada, we love dogs.
[40:22.390 --> 40:22.530]  Yep.
[40:23.670 --> 40:25.870]  We clearly love dogs more than Canada.
[40:26.550 --> 40:27.630]  How dare you.
[40:28.550 --> 40:29.390]  I never said it.
[40:29.630 --> 40:31.790]  I said I'd like to claim it, I didn't even say we are.
[40:32.150 --> 40:33.110]  Walk it back, Canadian.
[40:33.110 --> 40:35.110]  There's no walking back, I never walked it forward.
[40:35.750 --> 40:37.070]  I can't walk it back.
[40:37.950 --> 40:40.210]  When does, uh, f*** Faceoff start coming out?
[40:40.210 --> 40:41.230]  Uh, Monday.
[40:41.530 --> 40:44.410]  It's already out now if you go to f***facepod.com
[40:45.350 --> 40:45.830]  Sick!
[40:46.190 --> 40:46.310]  Yeah.
[40:48.170 --> 40:50.190]  Episodes have begun by the time this is out.
[40:50.410 --> 40:52.250]  I watched the intro and I fucking
[40:52.250 --> 40:53.830]  laughed and laughed and laughed.
[40:53.870 --> 40:56.170]  We put up, so if you want to
[40:56.170 --> 40:57.890]  get a tease of it before you sign up,
[40:58.130 --> 40:59.670]  f***facepod.com slash first.
[41:00.070 --> 41:02.170]  We put out like the first 13 minutes
[41:02.170 --> 41:04.510]  like we talked about in the episode.
[41:04.890 --> 41:06.090]  So it's all the drafting
[41:06.090 --> 41:08.090]  and everything up until
[41:08.090 --> 41:09.510]  the baseball game.
[41:09.890 --> 41:12.110]  Does it just end with like, alright, let's do it.
[41:12.930 --> 41:14.170]  Yeah, it really is
[41:14.170 --> 41:16.090]  and then it goes into like the teaser
[41:16.090 --> 41:18.190]  for like the thing. It's like a minute of
[41:18.190 --> 41:20.050]  like us yelling at the baseball
[41:20.050 --> 41:21.790]  game and then it ends and I just went,
[41:21.870 --> 41:23.870]  that's great, man. We really nailed that.
[41:26.410 --> 41:27.990]  That reminds me
[41:27.990 --> 41:30.190]  of, uh, when I did the
[41:30.190 --> 41:31.830]  when I did the presentation
[41:31.830 --> 41:33.830]  for why I deserved the
[41:33.830 --> 41:36.230]  Cock Award, I shared my screen
[41:36.230 --> 41:37.930]  and I shared everything
[41:37.930 --> 41:39.850]  and I think it was edited out.
[41:39.990 --> 41:42.110]  I put jokes in all of my
[41:42.110 --> 41:43.970]  tabs, but then it was just
[41:43.970 --> 41:46.110]  the section in which I went
[41:46.110 --> 41:48.210]  to share my screen and showed all the tabs I had open
[41:48.210 --> 41:50.170]  was removed, which then
[41:50.170 --> 41:52.390]  is alarming because of like what the tabs
[41:52.390 --> 41:54.270]  were. I don't remember all
[41:54.270 --> 41:56.170]  of them, but like one of them was like child-kicking
[41:56.170 --> 41:57.870]  velocity was a search I had.
[41:58.010 --> 42:00.190]  I had all very clear
[42:00.190 --> 42:01.990]  jokes that I'm assuming
[42:01.990 --> 42:04.130]  just went unnoticed, but I could also imagine
[42:04.130 --> 42:05.730]  the editor looking at it, just being like,
[42:05.770 --> 42:08.030]  it's just personal stuff. He's just
[42:08.030 --> 42:10.370]  looking at this. I think I had Branston Pickle
[42:10.370 --> 42:11.870]  as a search in one of my tabs.
[42:13.530 --> 42:14.210]  Oh, we better
[42:14.210 --> 42:16.090]  cut this out. We don't want to expose Andrew.
[42:18.210 --> 42:19.590]  That's not that from a
[42:19.590 --> 42:22.050]  concept of exposing. I just think
[42:22.050 --> 42:24.090]  my concern was they looked at it and thought
[42:24.090 --> 42:25.710]  that is just what I would naturally search.
[42:26.470 --> 42:27.950]  And no one spoke to you about it.
[42:28.310 --> 42:30.170]  No. I just heard
[42:30.170 --> 42:32.230]  because I brought it up and then I heard later.
[42:33.250 --> 42:34.370]  Andrew and Gavin,
[42:34.450 --> 42:36.230]  did you guys see the special thing that
[42:36.230 --> 42:38.190]  happened on the Break Show that we filmed
[42:38.190 --> 42:39.370]  this week? I don't know when.
[42:39.790 --> 42:42.350]  I heard something really exciting happen. I haven't had a chance
[42:42.350 --> 42:44.030]  to watch it yet, though. Dude,
[42:44.210 --> 42:46.090]  it was pretty fucking awesome. I bought this
[42:46.630 --> 42:48.390]  basketball blind box thing
[42:48.390 --> 42:50.070]  where you just get an
[42:50.070 --> 42:51.710]  autographed basketball. It could be any of
[42:52.190 --> 42:53.630]  a hundred different players.
[42:54.730 --> 42:56.070]  And we pulled a
[42:56.070 --> 42:57.970]  Shaquille O'Neal autographed basketball.
[42:58.130 --> 43:00.110]  Wow! Oh my god.
[43:00.110 --> 43:01.870]  I can't imagine anybody
[43:01.870 --> 43:03.790]  much cooler than Shaquille O'Neal to get
[43:03.790 --> 43:05.910]  an autographed basketball. No. That's
[43:05.910 --> 43:07.610]  fucking awesome. Especially considering
[43:07.610 --> 43:10.150]  you know, I don't know. I feel like we've spoken about
[43:10.150 --> 43:12.150]  him positively in the past on this podcast
[43:12.150 --> 43:13.850]  and I'm a big fan. It was pretty
[43:13.850 --> 43:16.310]  fucking awesome. That's so cool.
[43:16.690 --> 43:18.210]  That's my plug for the Break Show.
[43:18.770 --> 43:19.790]  And also it's just
[43:19.790 --> 43:22.070]  fitting because you got the Shaq attack on the desk
[43:22.070 --> 43:24.010]  like we've been foreshadowing this.
[43:24.110 --> 43:26.010]  We put the basketball in
[43:26.010 --> 43:27.910]  the Shaq so that he was holding it.
[43:27.910 --> 43:28.930]  That's great.
[43:29.290 --> 43:30.550]  I can't wait to watch that.
[43:31.510 --> 43:33.930]  Those Break Shows are really fun. I've really enjoyed
[43:33.930 --> 43:35.990]  watching you guys open those cards and it's
[43:35.990 --> 43:37.150]  good. Thanks man.
[43:38.830 --> 43:39.890]  I've got a thing
[43:39.890 --> 43:41.990]  I've been doing in the background that nobody's caught on
[43:41.990 --> 43:44.050]  to yet that I've really been enjoying.
[43:44.250 --> 43:45.830]  I don't have the opportunity to do it a lot
[43:45.830 --> 43:48.170]  but when I do it, it makes me fucking laugh
[43:48.170 --> 43:49.950]  and it's directed at
[43:49.950 --> 43:51.870]  one person and that person hasn't
[43:51.870 --> 43:53.930]  figured it out yet and I want to see
[43:53.930 --> 43:55.890]  how long that'll go on for. That's really
[43:55.890 --> 43:57.970]  funny. Are they on this
[43:57.970 --> 43:59.890]  podcast? They may or
[43:59.890 --> 44:01.810]  may not be. If they're not on this podcast
[44:01.810 --> 44:03.870]  they listened to it. They're either on this
[44:03.870 --> 44:05.030]  podcast or they listened to it.
[44:07.110 --> 44:07.990]  Do you
[44:07.990 --> 44:09.750]  have anything that you have hidden
[44:09.750 --> 44:11.310]  Gavin throughout these that
[44:12.050 --> 44:13.070]  nobody's discovered yet?
[44:14.230 --> 44:14.710]  Throughout what?
[44:15.770 --> 44:17.770]  I think that's a no.
[44:18.330 --> 44:19.030]  That's a no.
[44:20.730 --> 44:21.810]  You don't have any of those.
[44:22.010 --> 44:23.710]  I have a few things that I've
[44:23.710 --> 44:25.950]  put out there. You're laying little easter eggs?
[44:26.870 --> 44:27.710]  Yeah, whenever
[44:27.710 --> 44:29.730]  I can I like to throw out... Eric and I
[44:29.730 --> 44:31.770]  were talking about in something we recorded recently
[44:31.770 --> 44:33.810]  like the ARG stuff
[44:33.810 --> 44:35.810]  of Cloverfield was so much fun. Whenever
[44:35.810 --> 44:37.690]  I have the ability to throw
[44:37.690 --> 44:39.810]  an easter egg or that type of thing out there, I do.
[44:39.990 --> 44:41.690]  So I definitely... I have a few that people
[44:41.690 --> 44:43.830]  haven't found and that brings me a lot of joy
[44:43.830 --> 44:45.870]  that they're just there undiscovered.
[44:46.170 --> 44:47.670]  What's the name
[44:47.670 --> 44:49.810]  of that game we're playing, the three of us?
[44:50.610 --> 44:51.030]  Immortality.
[44:51.830 --> 44:52.290]  Immortality.
[44:52.690 --> 44:55.170]  By the time this is
[44:55.170 --> 44:57.090]  out, that is not out yet. That'll start
[44:57.090 --> 44:59.130]  coming out on Rooster Teeth first
[44:59.130 --> 45:01.230]  for our Let's Play channel because
[45:02.130 --> 45:02.770]  it's like
[45:02.770 --> 45:05.190]  boy, is it our take on Funhaus?
[45:05.430 --> 45:06.590]  Boy, is there nudity.
[45:07.410 --> 45:08.990]  There's a lot of fucking
[45:08.990 --> 45:11.350]  in it. There's a lot.
[45:11.430 --> 45:12.970]  There's a lot there. It's really something.
[45:14.790 --> 45:15.250]  Gavin,
[45:15.510 --> 45:17.150]  it's the biggest whiplash I've ever
[45:17.150 --> 45:17.930]  had with a video.
[45:17.930 --> 45:19.490]  Yeah, me too.
[45:19.690 --> 45:21.370]  I actually recently just
[45:21.830 --> 45:23.810]  played my first naughty
[45:23.810 --> 45:25.030]  naked game.
[45:26.630 --> 45:27.890]  Tell us about
[45:27.890 --> 45:28.250]  it, man.
[45:29.410 --> 45:31.650]  As you know, Meg and I play
[45:32.230 --> 45:33.850]  Battle Chess, which
[45:33.850 --> 45:36.010]  is a game from the late 80s
[45:36.010 --> 45:37.770]  early 90s where it's chess but
[45:37.770 --> 45:39.130]  they have little fights.
[45:39.810 --> 45:41.770]  It's animated. Yeah, it's like Star Wars.
[45:42.170 --> 45:43.830]  I was like, I wonder if there's
[45:43.830 --> 45:45.710]  a modern version
[45:45.710 --> 45:47.730]  of Battle Chess and there is
[45:47.730 --> 45:49.790]  and apparently it's shit but then in the Steam menu
[45:49.790 --> 45:51.690]  was a game called Sex Chess
[45:53.310 --> 45:53.790]  and
[45:53.790 --> 45:55.730]  I thought it'd be funny to
[45:55.730 --> 45:56.970]  install that but it's
[45:57.670 --> 45:59.210]  not funny. It's just...
[45:59.770 --> 46:01.690]  It's just sad. It's just
[46:01.690 --> 46:03.710]  horrible and I wish I
[46:03.710 --> 46:04.630]  could unbuy it.
[46:05.150 --> 46:07.610]  I don't get it. Well, the fact
[46:07.610 --> 46:09.510]  that you bought it on Steam
[46:10.030 --> 46:11.770]  Yeah. Yeah, so you've
[46:11.770 --> 46:13.450]  played it for more than two hours so
[46:13.450 --> 46:15.170]  it is clearly you've hated it.
[46:15.770 --> 46:17.090]  Have I played it for more than two hours?
[46:17.410 --> 46:19.370]  Well, if you can refund it. If you play for under
[46:19.370 --> 46:20.990]  two hours, you can get a refund on the game.
[46:21.230 --> 46:23.450]  Oh, well maybe I'm assuming. I must still
[46:23.450 --> 46:25.330]  be in that. I've probably played it for six minutes.
[46:26.330 --> 46:27.190]  Well, you're good.
[46:27.590 --> 46:29.430]  Yeah, go get that refund. Yeah, go get
[46:29.430 --> 46:31.430]  that refund. If he doesn't get that refund, we'll know he's
[46:31.430 --> 46:33.510]  still playing offline. Yeah, it
[46:33.510 --> 46:35.490]  has been such a joy and I hope
[46:35.490 --> 46:37.310]  like, you know, in social media
[46:37.310 --> 46:39.210]  like TikToks or whatever, there's sometimes
[46:39.210 --> 46:41.470]  that annoying thing of like, stick to the
[46:41.470 --> 46:43.350]  end. That couldn't be more true
[46:43.350 --> 46:45.070]  to our first immortality video
[46:45.070 --> 46:47.550]  where I love that game
[46:47.550 --> 46:49.170]  so much, just genuinely
[46:49.170 --> 46:51.330]  and you guys were not clicking
[46:51.330 --> 46:53.450]  with it for 98%
[46:53.450 --> 46:55.530]  of that first video. It is
[46:55.530 --> 46:57.470]  a non-stop train of
[46:57.470 --> 46:58.910]  shitting on this thing that I like.
[46:59.270 --> 47:01.210]  So I was just rolling with it and then it
[47:01.210 --> 47:03.310]  shifted and it connected with
[47:03.310 --> 47:05.170]  you guys and it has been a
[47:05.170 --> 47:07.370]  completely different experience in video
[47:07.370 --> 47:09.210]  two. It knocked my dick
[47:09.210 --> 47:10.890]  completely off of my body.
[47:11.050 --> 47:13.170]  I could not believe what
[47:13.170 --> 47:15.290]  happened. I could not believe
[47:15.290 --> 47:17.290]  the corner. I turned on
[47:17.290 --> 47:19.470]  the whole thing. We played
[47:19.470 --> 47:21.550]  a second time
[47:21.550 --> 47:23.390]  and I cannot wait to play
[47:23.390 --> 47:24.030]  again.
[47:24.990 --> 47:26.910]  Floored. Floored
[47:26.910 --> 47:29.090]  by this game that I
[47:29.090 --> 47:30.610]  shit on for
[47:31.210 --> 47:32.170]  60 minutes.
[47:32.870 --> 47:35.310]  I think of all the things that you guys have recorded
[47:35.310 --> 47:37.170]  that I've not been in, this is the one I'm most
[47:37.170 --> 47:37.850]  excited to see.
[47:38.270 --> 47:41.090]  I was texting Gavin about it saying
[47:41.090 --> 47:43.290]  exactly what you said, Eric, of I've never
[47:43.290 --> 47:45.230]  seen a bigger 180
[47:45.230 --> 47:47.350]  from anyone with any game than you two
[47:47.350 --> 47:49.030]  with Immortality. There are
[47:49.030 --> 47:51.310]  sections of that second video we filmed
[47:51.310 --> 47:53.250]  that are complete silence because
[47:53.250 --> 47:55.070]  you guys are just reading the text
[47:55.070 --> 47:56.730]  and getting wrapped up in the story.
[47:57.070 --> 47:59.250]  It has made me so happy how invested
[47:59.250 --> 48:01.610]  you both are. We need to
[48:01.610 --> 48:03.150]  finish this before this comes out though.
[48:03.190 --> 48:04.290]  I don't want you guys to get spoiled.
[48:04.290 --> 48:06.450]  Yeah, no, definitely I don't want to either.
[48:06.610 --> 48:07.890]  I'll say this about this game.
[48:09.290 --> 48:10.470]  You may or may not
[48:10.470 --> 48:12.050]  know that my favorite
[48:12.830 --> 48:14.290]  creator of all time is
[48:14.290 --> 48:16.390]  David Lynch, right? I kind of worship David
[48:16.390 --> 48:18.270]  Lynch above all else, all
[48:18.270 --> 48:20.370]  others. And I
[48:20.910 --> 48:22.030]  have... David Cronenberg
[48:22.030 --> 48:24.350]  has come close in the past, but I've
[48:24.350 --> 48:25.550]  never encountered anyone
[48:26.270 --> 48:28.310]  who is as
[48:29.050 --> 48:30.170]  lynchy in his lynch
[48:30.170 --> 48:32.510]  and a lot of people try. And I'm not saying Cronenberg's
[48:32.510 --> 48:34.590]  trying. He's his own thing. But it's the closest
[48:34.590 --> 48:36.550]  thing I can get to being like of the
[48:36.550 --> 48:38.810]  same level of
[48:39.490 --> 48:40.770]  just like immersive
[48:40.770 --> 48:42.690]  weird aesthetic and
[48:42.690 --> 48:44.530]  intellectualism and
[48:44.530 --> 48:46.470]  layers that David Lynch productions
[48:46.470 --> 48:48.270]  are. And this game
[48:49.010 --> 48:50.510]  has it. Like I've
[48:50.510 --> 48:52.490]  never... I've played all the games
[48:52.490 --> 48:54.290]  that they tout as like the Alan Wakes
[48:54.290 --> 48:56.430]  all the... the one that Funhaus
[48:56.430 --> 48:58.250]  played for a while about the weird town
[48:58.250 --> 49:00.610]  and the person shows up that's supposed to be very David Lynch-y
[49:00.610 --> 49:02.350]  that's fucking dog shit. Like
[49:02.350 --> 49:04.490]  none of...
[49:04.490 --> 49:06.430]  no other movie... any time
[49:06.430 --> 49:08.390]  something is described as
[49:08.390 --> 49:10.590]  David Lynch-ian or Lynch-esque, it's
[49:10.590 --> 49:12.270]  always a letdown. This game
[49:12.270 --> 49:14.410]  fucking nails it. It is really
[49:14.410 --> 49:16.130]  impressive and it's really fun
[49:16.130 --> 49:18.310]  and it's bizarre.
[49:19.190 --> 49:20.050]  Just bizarre. I can't wait.
[49:20.430 --> 49:22.230]  Cannot wait to continue that with you guys.
[49:23.070 --> 49:23.510]  Yeah, me too.
[49:24.370 --> 49:25.350]  How many pots will it be?
[49:26.830 --> 49:28.470]  Three or four. I think...
[49:28.470 --> 49:30.450]  I bet it'll be four. I don't think there's...
[49:30.450 --> 49:32.470]  From what we did and what we
[49:32.470 --> 49:34.530]  found in this last one, I don't think
[49:34.530 --> 49:36.110]  that... I think we're probably about halfway.
[49:36.830 --> 49:38.430]  I bet we get pretty
[49:38.430 --> 49:40.390]  deep in three and then in four
[49:40.390 --> 49:42.290]  we get it about halfway through the video
[49:42.290 --> 49:44.070]  and we are... I bet we're gonna be
[49:45.090 --> 49:45.970]  fired up.
[49:46.830 --> 49:48.690]  I mean that'll be a nice contrast between
[49:48.690 --> 49:50.490]  that and our thumbsticks videos
[49:50.490 --> 49:52.290]  which I think will be 650
[49:52.290 --> 49:53.910]  Oh my god. Oh no!
[49:54.490 --> 49:54.930]  What?
[49:54.930 --> 49:57.230]  We filmed
[49:57.230 --> 49:58.990]  two thumbsticks videos and we
[49:58.990 --> 50:00.730]  haven't won yet to get off of
[50:00.730 --> 50:02.770]  base sticks. We haven't even used
[50:02.770 --> 50:04.010]  my thumbsticks yet.
[50:06.230 --> 50:07.070]  We haven't
[50:07.070 --> 50:08.990]  made it to the final six times.
[50:09.050 --> 50:11.110]  Gavin and I just have had issues recently.
[50:11.930 --> 50:12.970]  We wanted to
[50:12.970 --> 50:14.970]  record... Finally something happened, Geoff, that I've
[50:14.970 --> 50:17.110]  heard about countless times from you
[50:17.110 --> 50:19.050]  throughout your sort of reputation thing.
[50:19.670 --> 50:20.870]  Gavin, I thought it would be fun
[50:20.870 --> 50:23.050]  because Gavin and I play Halo Infinite all the time
[50:23.050 --> 50:25.210]  together. We haven't done any ranked
[50:25.210 --> 50:27.150]  so I thought, oh, it'd be fun if
[50:27.150 --> 50:29.010]  you and I do a ranked thing and so we
[50:29.010 --> 50:31.390]  did it and we filmed all five games
[50:31.390 --> 50:33.210]  and we decided
[50:33.210 --> 50:35.150]  to scrap the video because we
[50:35.150 --> 50:37.130]  didn't have anything due to
[50:37.130 --> 50:39.130]  the fact that in game one
[50:39.130 --> 50:41.110]  and game two, Gavin was trying to
[50:41.110 --> 50:43.010]  play using the large TV in his
[50:43.010 --> 50:45.090]  office that was in front of his face and he
[50:45.090 --> 50:46.990]  couldn't see and it was making him sick
[50:46.990 --> 50:48.950]  and so he had one
[50:48.950 --> 50:51.050]  kill in the first game and then two
[50:51.050 --> 50:53.210]  kills in the second game, which is horrendous
[50:53.210 --> 50:55.290]  for him. Like, this is a really bad performance
[50:55.290 --> 50:56.410]  even for Gavin's standards.
[50:57.110 --> 50:58.410]  And then in the third game,
[50:59.310 --> 51:00.410]  he... You're welcome.
[51:00.930 --> 51:03.210]  He decided to grab an HDMI cable
[51:03.210 --> 51:05.090]  so he could move the gameplay to a
[51:05.090 --> 51:07.070]  different screen that he could use.
[51:07.410 --> 51:08.650]  But when he did that,
[51:09.010 --> 51:10.870]  he lost all of his footage
[51:10.870 --> 51:12.330]  for the first two games.
[51:12.750 --> 51:14.830]  Gone. So we lost
[51:14.830 --> 51:16.510]  two and a half games worth of footage.
[51:16.790 --> 51:18.970]  We have half a game there. In our
[51:18.970 --> 51:20.810]  fourth game, everybody
[51:20.810 --> 51:22.330]  on the other team quit
[51:22.970 --> 51:25.110]  except one guy, so we didn't really get
[51:25.110 --> 51:26.910]  anything there. So Gavin
[51:26.910 --> 51:29.210]  had a game and a half. And so we decided
[51:29.210 --> 51:31.030]  to scrap our entire hour of
[51:31.030 --> 51:32.970]  footage that we recorded. Complete waste
[51:32.970 --> 51:34.950]  of time. That would have been a lot to cut as
[51:34.950 --> 51:36.930]  well because one of the people
[51:36.930 --> 51:39.150]  on our team was very unhappy that I wasn't
[51:39.150 --> 51:41.050]  doing well and kept writing
[51:41.050 --> 51:42.090]  a lot of mean things.
[51:42.590 --> 51:44.890]  And we kept getting matched with them over
[51:44.890 --> 51:46.950]  and over again. So they had like a three
[51:46.950 --> 51:49.030]  game arc with Gavin getting progressively
[51:49.030 --> 51:50.190]  more angry at him.
[51:50.310 --> 51:53.030]  He would like load in with us and he'd be like
[51:53.030 --> 51:53.870]  oh shit!
[51:56.250 --> 51:58.170]  And I'm there trying to
[51:58.170 --> 51:59.190]  plug in
[51:59.190 --> 52:01.010]  cables and like unfreeze my audio.
[52:02.190 --> 52:02.750]  So
[52:02.750 --> 52:05.050]  we lost that and then the
[52:05.050 --> 52:06.750]  next day decided well
[52:06.750 --> 52:09.070]  let's do it again. And we both
[52:09.070 --> 52:11.250]  made or used alternate profiles
[52:11.250 --> 52:13.250]  because I thought me being ranked what I was
[52:13.250 --> 52:15.290]  might like make it tougher for Gavin's
[52:15.290 --> 52:17.210]  ranking. Because they might factor that in.
[52:17.290 --> 52:19.290]  So let's start fresh. So we
[52:19.290 --> 52:21.090]  both are on alternate accounts.
[52:21.670 --> 52:23.450]  We get ready to go. We're recording.
[52:23.750 --> 52:25.290]  I do the intro for what we're gonna do.
[52:25.350 --> 52:27.290]  I set everything up. I then learn that
[52:27.290 --> 52:29.290]  you need to play a minimum of 25
[52:29.290 --> 52:31.230]  Halo Infinite games before it lets you
[52:31.230 --> 52:32.850]  ranked. So we can't
[52:32.850 --> 52:35.210]  be ranked. So then we just
[52:35.210 --> 52:37.370]  decide to play normal Halo Infinite
[52:37.370 --> 52:38.590]  and that'll be the video.
[52:39.070 --> 52:41.390]  We finish the video. I have
[52:41.390 --> 52:43.450]  accidentally stopped recording my audio
[52:43.450 --> 52:45.170]  12 seconds into what we did.
[52:45.250 --> 52:47.650]  So we've lost two Halo
[52:47.650 --> 52:49.570]  Infinite videos. We've scrapped both of
[52:49.570 --> 52:51.790]  them because we just don't have anything to salvage
[52:51.790 --> 52:53.470]  it. We can't
[52:53.470 --> 52:55.550]  play Halo Infinite. The game that we play the
[52:55.550 --> 52:57.190]  most without recording,
[52:57.510 --> 52:59.550]  without any issue, we cannot capture
[52:59.550 --> 53:01.230]  a moment of. So now
[53:01.230 --> 53:03.410]  the plan is to wait for the new season to start
[53:03.410 --> 53:04.790]  and then we can re-rank.
[53:05.050 --> 53:07.330]  So we re-rank it. I think the universe
[53:07.330 --> 53:08.750]  is trying to tell you not to play Halo.
[53:09.390 --> 53:11.410]  It is the equivalent of you two always
[53:11.410 --> 53:13.450]  it raining when you guys would get together.
[53:13.590 --> 53:15.450]  But that eventually stopped so I'm hopeful
[53:15.450 --> 53:17.450]  that eventually we will be able to record
[53:17.450 --> 53:18.990]  us playing Halo Infinite.
[53:19.470 --> 53:21.470]  I think actually at Austin, summer just ended
[53:21.470 --> 53:22.530]  this week.
[53:23.630 --> 53:24.570]  Yeah. It's over?
[53:24.970 --> 53:26.990]  What an amazing summer though.
[53:27.410 --> 53:27.970]  Phenomenal.
[53:29.570 --> 53:30.790]  According to whose metrics?
[53:32.630 --> 53:33.490]  Well, just
[53:33.490 --> 53:34.290]  weather metrics.
[53:35.550 --> 53:37.130]  I didn't understand
[53:37.130 --> 53:38.370]  if he meant by...
[53:38.370 --> 53:39.670]  This is the worst summer of my life.
[53:39.810 --> 53:40.890]  What are you talking about?
[53:41.710 --> 53:43.930]  It was 107 degrees every day.
[53:44.070 --> 53:45.870]  Everything in Austin died.
[53:46.470 --> 53:48.050]  Oh, I love it. I had fun swimming.
[53:48.270 --> 53:50.230]  You love it? Yeah, like out on the
[53:50.230 --> 53:51.390]  boat and stuff. It was amazing.
[53:51.850 --> 53:53.110]  I mean, that was fun, yeah.
[53:53.610 --> 53:55.950]  The day to day, like
[53:56.390 --> 53:58.330]  putting the bins out and coming back
[53:58.330 --> 53:59.470]  sweating. Not ideal.
[54:00.570 --> 54:01.390]  But I'm talking about
[54:01.390 --> 54:03.910]  what allows you summer antics
[54:03.910 --> 54:04.550]  was phenomenal.
[54:07.070 --> 54:09.490]  Getting in your pool
[54:09.490 --> 54:10.530]  when it was 94 out
[54:10.530 --> 54:11.810]  and you made the pool 94
[54:11.810 --> 54:13.970]  was a really interesting way to
[54:13.970 --> 54:15.410]  cap off the whole thing.
[54:15.730 --> 54:16.470]  Yeah, I messed it up.
[54:18.330 --> 54:19.970]  That was a great way to cap off
[54:19.970 --> 54:20.970]  a weird summer, man.
[54:21.090 --> 54:23.790]  Here's how I envisioned that went down,
[54:23.970 --> 54:25.590]  Eric. I think it went down like this.
[54:26.070 --> 54:26.850]  Meg was like,
[54:27.310 --> 54:29.110]  they're coming over again. And Gav's like,
[54:29.170 --> 54:31.030]  they keep asking to come over every Saturday.
[54:31.190 --> 54:32.530]  And Meg's like, it's fucking summer's over.
[54:32.530 --> 54:34.330]  We gotta do something about this. Make it hot.
[54:34.630 --> 54:36.370]  Make it so unpleasant that they don't come back.
[54:36.430 --> 54:38.110]  And Gav's like, yeah, we'll do that.
[54:38.990 --> 54:39.530]  Boil them out.
[54:40.610 --> 54:42.230]  Let's boil them like lobsters.
[54:42.670 --> 54:44.670]  Wait, you guys, he got invited
[54:44.670 --> 54:46.530]  or you went to Gav's pool and it was warmer
[54:46.530 --> 54:48.150]  in the pool than it was outside the pool?
[54:48.150 --> 54:50.770]  No, no, no, Andrew. It was the same temperature
[54:50.770 --> 54:52.570]  in the pool as it was
[54:52.570 --> 54:54.650]  outside of the pool. So when you
[54:54.650 --> 54:56.490]  stood perfectly still inside
[54:56.490 --> 54:58.670]  the pool, it did not feel like there was
[54:58.670 --> 54:59.830]  any water anywhere.
[54:59.830 --> 55:01.050]  It was just
[55:02.270 --> 55:03.890]  94 degrees across your
[55:03.890 --> 55:05.690]  entire body, no matter
[55:05.690 --> 55:07.790]  how deep or shallow you were
[55:07.790 --> 55:08.770]  in the pool.
[55:10.110 --> 55:11.870]  I just stood in there
[55:11.870 --> 55:13.590]  with you and your small wife, and I just
[55:13.590 --> 55:16.030]  was just like, look, I've never been a good host.
[55:16.250 --> 55:16.550]  I apologize.
[55:19.550 --> 55:21.950]  I'm not good at this. Some people have it,
[55:21.970 --> 55:23.150]  I don't have it. I don't know what I'm doing.
[55:23.430 --> 55:25.570]  It was legitimately
[55:25.570 --> 55:27.730]  the funniest way to like
[55:27.730 --> 55:29.750]  cap off summer that was so
[55:29.750 --> 55:31.410]  relentlessly hot to be like,
[55:31.670 --> 55:33.710]  ah, let's cool off in this pool, and it's
[55:33.710 --> 55:35.670]  walking in and going, what the
[55:35.670 --> 55:36.510]  fuck?
[55:38.350 --> 55:39.650]  You were mad.
[55:39.770 --> 55:41.310]  You were pretty mad about it.
[55:41.430 --> 55:43.490]  It was so, like, it was,
[55:43.790 --> 55:45.810]  I mean, really, I was sort of, I was
[55:45.810 --> 55:47.750]  just flummoxed. Like, I've
[55:47.750 --> 55:49.670]  never, it's just never been
[55:49.670 --> 55:51.730]  so hot out, and then you get in
[55:51.730 --> 55:53.950]  a pool that is equally
[55:53.950 --> 55:55.570]  hot as outside.
[55:55.570 --> 55:57.050]  It was incredible.
[55:57.290 --> 55:59.490]  I've never done anything like that.
[55:59.570 --> 56:00.430]  It was really stunning.
[56:01.650 --> 56:03.070]  Thank you for the new experience, Gav.
[56:03.690 --> 56:05.670]  You know, I've learned from my mistakes.
[56:06.850 --> 56:07.470]  Moving on.
[56:07.690 --> 56:09.490]  All jokes aside, it's a,
[56:09.610 --> 56:11.730]  even at 94 degrees, it is a joy
[56:11.730 --> 56:13.210]  to get to spend a Saturday with you
[56:13.210 --> 56:15.270]  in or out of a pool.
[56:15.550 --> 56:17.290]  It doesn't matter where I am. It was fun.
[56:17.530 --> 56:19.210]  We listened to the playlist in 98 a lot.
[56:19.470 --> 56:21.210]  Yeah, it was a good one. Yeah, we did. Nice.
[56:21.630 --> 56:23.510]  Oh, that was good. Oh, man. Hey, I have
[56:23.510 --> 56:25.230]  a question for you guys. I was talking to my,
[56:25.450 --> 56:26.710]  you know, my video game buddies.
[56:27.030 --> 56:29.410]  We were trucking last night,
[56:29.950 --> 56:31.510]  and we're up in Alaska now. We're going to talk about that.
[56:31.690 --> 56:32.870]  We're going up to Pedro Bay.
[56:33.170 --> 56:35.070]  We were running, fuck, we were running
[56:35.070 --> 56:37.310]  some long
[56:37.310 --> 56:38.950]  pipes up to Pedro Bay.
[56:40.150 --> 56:41.230]  Burndog had one of these,
[56:41.610 --> 56:43.250]  had an eight-wheel, oh my god,
[56:43.310 --> 56:45.630]  it was an eight-slaughter. It's the biggest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
[56:45.710 --> 56:47.390]  Anyway, we got to talking,
[56:47.610 --> 56:49.630]  and they were sharing stories about hallucinating.
[56:49.790 --> 56:51.590]  Like, times they've hallucinated in their life from being
[56:51.590 --> 56:53.410]  ill or, you know.
[56:53.990 --> 56:55.750]  And I got to thinking, I don't think I've
[56:55.750 --> 56:56.690]  ever hallucinated
[56:57.630 --> 56:59.710]  at all. Like, I can't remember a single
[56:59.710 --> 57:01.510]  time in my life where I was ever in a
[57:01.510 --> 57:03.530]  situation where I hallucinated. Have you guys ever
[57:04.330 --> 57:05.750]  actually hallucinated and saw things
[57:05.750 --> 57:07.330]  that weren't there? I have once.
[57:08.210 --> 57:09.610]  Really? Yeah, I think I had
[57:09.610 --> 57:11.710]  heat stroke or something. I was on a holiday,
[57:12.110 --> 57:13.730]  and I was just feeling like a bit
[57:13.730 --> 57:14.970]  in the sun too long, and I went in to
[57:15.590 --> 57:17.570]  throw up, and I went into
[57:17.570 --> 57:19.630]  the villa, and I opened the toilet seat,
[57:19.630 --> 57:21.550]  and a bottle of ketchup fell out of the
[57:21.550 --> 57:23.410]  toilet onto the floor. I was like, Jesus!
[57:23.850 --> 57:25.430]  And then I was like, oh, there's no ketchup.
[57:32.960 --> 57:33.700]  Even your
[57:33.700 --> 57:35.080]  hallucinations are boring.
[57:35.440 --> 57:36.960]  I know. I shouldn't...
[57:37.480 --> 57:38.640]  I don't know why I told that.
[57:40.940 --> 57:42.240]  Yeah, that's shy, isn't it?
[57:42.260 --> 57:43.600]  What kind of ketchup was it?
[57:43.940 --> 57:45.440]  Just like a bog-standard
[57:45.440 --> 57:47.140]  squirt bottle of Heinz ketchup.
[57:48.880 --> 57:49.320]  Why?
[57:49.780 --> 57:51.480]  Why? Did you just have french fries
[57:51.480 --> 57:53.500]  or something? No! And I didn't even
[57:53.500 --> 57:54.320]  like ketchup then.
[57:55.600 --> 57:57.000]  Your idle mind
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.240]  was thinking of ketchup.
[57:59.720 --> 58:00.380]  That's really weird.
[58:01.840 --> 58:02.640]  Oh, man.
[58:03.100 --> 58:04.740]  Yeah, how about the rest of you?
[58:05.580 --> 58:07.520]  I've had like... has anyone here
[58:07.520 --> 58:09.580]  experienced exploding ears syndrome?
[58:10.180 --> 58:11.620]  Like, I feel like that's maybe the closest
[58:11.620 --> 58:13.260]  I've had to like that. What?
[58:13.580 --> 58:15.400]  You just made me spit out all over my
[58:15.400 --> 58:17.460]  fucking keyboard. Oh my... what?
[58:18.180 --> 58:19.380]  I have regulation ears, but
[58:19.380 --> 58:21.420]  exploding ears, it's like a thing where when you're
[58:21.420 --> 58:23.540]  like coming... you're waking up or
[58:23.540 --> 58:25.220]  like falling asleep, where
[58:25.220 --> 58:27.360]  my ear sounds like a bomb is
[58:27.360 --> 58:29.580]  going off, like it's a sound
[58:29.580 --> 58:31.140]  that doesn't actually exist,
[58:31.460 --> 58:33.520]  but like it ramps up in speed
[58:34.160 --> 58:35.660]  or in effect,
[58:35.800 --> 58:37.340]  I guess. Yeah, I feel like Eric
[58:37.340 --> 58:38.620]  had that with like white noise.
[58:39.140 --> 58:41.240]  I've had that sometimes. You think that
[58:41.240 --> 58:43.560]  you think you hear a bang, you think that something
[58:43.560 --> 58:45.420]  has happened, you hear it
[58:45.420 --> 58:47.480]  ramp up and then you hear it and then it's like
[58:47.940 --> 58:49.460]  Oh, I guess something's wrong
[58:49.460 --> 58:51.180]  with my brain and then you go to sleep.
[58:51.340 --> 58:53.500]  Yeah, it's like it throttles almost
[58:53.500 --> 58:55.400]  like it increases and spikes.
[58:55.820 --> 58:57.500]  Yeah. Is it kind of like when you're falling
[58:57.500 --> 58:59.340]  asleep at night, if you're like
[58:59.340 --> 59:01.220]  half asleep, sometimes you can hear people talking
[59:01.220 --> 59:03.940]  but you can't make out what they're saying, you can just kind of hear them talk.
[59:04.380 --> 59:05.600]  What? I don't have that.
[59:05.680 --> 59:07.340]  You guys don't have that? Yeah, I think you have
[59:07.340 --> 59:09.280]  I think that might be a
[59:09.280 --> 59:11.540]  brain disorder. You got your AirPods in there?
[59:11.920 --> 59:13.600]  No, you've never heard
[59:13.600 --> 59:15.100]  that before? Sometimes it's y'all.
[59:15.100 --> 59:16.700]  Like sometimes I can hear you guys talking.
[59:16.960 --> 59:18.980]  Voices? You're saying you hear
[59:18.980 --> 59:21.040]  voices when you go to bed? Yeah, like I can
[59:21.040 --> 59:22.900]  tell, like Gavin and Andrew specifically,
[59:23.060 --> 59:25.120]  I can hear Gavin and Andrew like, when I'm like half
[59:25.120 --> 59:26.800]  asleep in my pillow sometimes and I'm like
[59:26.800 --> 59:29.080]  yeah, you're like, you know you're about to fall asleep
[59:29.080 --> 59:30.660]  but you're not totally asleep and you're just kind of like
[59:31.340 --> 59:33.040]  relaxing into sleep, I can hear like in the
[59:33.040 --> 59:34.900]  background, real quietly, like just people talking
[59:34.900 --> 59:37.040]  and I think like, if I try to pay attention to what
[59:37.040 --> 59:39.120]  they're saying, I'll wake up and then I won't be able to go back to sleep
[59:39.120 --> 59:39.940]  so I'll just go to sleep.
[59:41.560 --> 59:42.920]  I don't know, I've never heard that.
[59:42.920 --> 59:44.860]  I mean, I've had, I've like listened
[59:44.860 --> 59:47.020]  to stuff and then suddenly like the voices
[59:47.020 --> 59:48.980]  I'm listening to get all peaceful and I feel like
[59:48.980 --> 59:50.760]  if I try and listen, I won't fall asleep.
[59:51.040 --> 59:51.860]  But that's because I'm actually
[59:52.660 --> 59:54.000]  putting shit in my ears though.
[59:54.620 --> 59:56.940]  Yeah, no. My brain doesn't make it up.
[59:57.340 --> 59:57.460]  What?
[59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.760]  I can't, I don't think
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.260]  Geoff, you have to go to a doctor.
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:04.420]  What?
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.380]  Are you talking about?
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:08.500]  Surely that's happened to y'all.
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.760]  No. No. No.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.240]  Alright, well I
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.740]  listen, I don't know, I've never talked
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.380]  about it with her.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.080]  You don't keep it that way, bud.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.600]  I don't think I've maybe talked
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.680]  about it until now.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.040]  Is she one of the voices?
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.860]  No, it's either
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.060]  people I don't recognize or it's
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.860]  in my life, I can remember
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.220]  distinctly Gavin,
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:34.540]  Andrew, Bernie Burns
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.960]  that's a particularly annoying one.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.840]  So you like
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.020]  I think I've heard Gus, people I know, a lot
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.760]  of people I know and then sometimes people I don't know.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.860]  So you've always had this
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.960]  and then after you met me, like one of your voices
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:47.600]  was British?
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.480]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.680]  I guess so.
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:55.120]  That's interesting. I wonder if
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.080]  like, are you sleeping and you don't realize
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.000]  it? Maybe, but
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.160]  it happens, you know,
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.760]  a couple times a month. Because I had one time where I
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.040]  my dream, talking about boring dreams, I was
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.180]  laying in bed, my hand was off the bed
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.980]  and it felt like
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:11.000]  somebody fist bumped me, but nobody
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.900]  was there and it woke me up, it was
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.940]  jarring. It was a gentle ghost situation,
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.800]  like Eric said, gentle whisper ghost.
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.940]  This was a gentle fist bump ghost
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:21.080]  but I woke up, I was like, who the fuck
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.980]  fist bumped me? Nobody's in this room,
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.160]  what is going on? And then just realizing, oh, that was just
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.060]  a shit dream where I like
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:28.920]  felt the thing. None of that
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.980]  happened. So this could be, maybe you're just having
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.800]  shit dreams of people talking.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.800]  Can you hear what they're saying or is it like
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.700]  just whispers that are... I feel like
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.720]  if I really focused
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.660]  maybe I could make it out, but you'd never
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:42.500]  want to because you just want to go to sleep.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.280]  But it's comforting. That's fair.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.840]  Like, it's really comforting. I don't mind it.
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.420]  It's a nice background noise.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.820]  It's weird that my voice making
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.720]  you feel comfortable, the story is making
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.320]  me feel uncomfortable. Yeah, same.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.860]  I'm looking it up and I'm finding
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:58.860]  reasons you might hear voices at
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.760]  night. Lack of sleep.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.880]  High temperature. Stress.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.660]  Grief. Mental
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.080]  illness. Hunger.
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:08.680]  I bet you're just hungry.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.140]  I don't think I'm hungry but
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.240]  I think all the others apply.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:14.720]  I think it's hot where you are and
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.880]  you have mental illness.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.220]  And grief.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:20.400]  Well,
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.720]  maybe the comment leavers will back me up.
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.720]  Maybe I'm not the only one. I really thought
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.800]  that that was a common thing.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:27.640]  That's interesting.
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.080]  That's crazy.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:31.840]  We should wrap
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.060]  this one up. That's a real cliffhanger.
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:36.140]  What are your hallucinogenics,
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:36.520]  Eric?
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:37.980]  Wait, what?
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.520]  Mine are all from
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.340]  like, drugs.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.560]  So, like,
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.120]  they're not
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.840]  going to sleep.
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.760]  Drugs. Yeah.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.520]  I don't think
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.560]  I've ever hallucinated on drugs
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.020]  either, though. Really?
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.260]  What? I don't think so.
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.560]  No acid or mushrooms
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:03.960]  or anything?
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.480]  Well, I mean, you know, I was a teenager
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.780]  once. I've experimented in a...
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.520]  I mean, I don't mind talking about it. It's just,
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.900]  you know, you kind of like... I accidentally did
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.500]  angel dust once.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.140]  What?
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:17.900]  What?
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.920]  I don't think I hallucinated
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.500]  there, either. Although, I was
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.280]  fucked up.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.640]  What is that? What?
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:29.700]  I guess
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.500]  it's PCP. It is. It's PCP.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.300]  I thought it was two
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.520]  no longer continued flavors of
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.300]  Kool-Aid that you accidentally mixed together.
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:39.540]  Alright, anyway,
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.420]  thanks for listening to F***face. Angel dust was a big thing in
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:43.580]  the 90s. Yeah, well, this was
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.760]  been when I was 23
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.700]  or so on tour with a band.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.780]  And I accidentally did it.
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:49.980]  Yeah.
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:51.140]  Uh...
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:53.960]  I thought I
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.780]  smoked pot and it was laced with... Yeah, that is...
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.580]  That's about... I know
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.420]  so many people that have had that happen to them.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:02.040]  I don't think I hallucinated then, either.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.240]  Also, don't do drugs, kids. Don't do drugs.
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:05.540]  Eric
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:08.540]  and I did drugs in our teens, so you don't have to.
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.320]  Learn from our mistakes.
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:11.740]  No, no, no. Don't listen to him. Don't do drugs.
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:14.060]  And Millie, don't listen to
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:14.380]  this podcast.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.920]  You don't have to worry about that.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.360]  That's long gone.
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:21.420]  Alright, now we should wrap this one up.
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:22.780]  Alright, let's go ahead and cut all the
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:24.980]  Geoff Did Drugs Once talk and we'll

[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:37.300]  Bye!
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:40.700]  Hey guys, Major League Fan

[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.380]  of F*** Face. Let's talk
