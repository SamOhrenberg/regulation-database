[00:10.140 --> 00:12.260]  Should we do it? Yeah! Let's do it. I'm ready.
[00:12.600 --> 00:14.700]  This is 177. Wait, 178.
[00:15.020 --> 00:16.520]  Oh, I'm getting leaf-blowered. Aww.
[00:16.980 --> 00:17.420]  Oh, no!
[00:18.160 --> 00:19.420]  You're getting leaf-blowered?
[00:19.680 --> 00:21.480]  The neighbors have fired up a leaf-blower.
[00:21.940 --> 00:23.860]  Oh, I can't hear it. It's fine. That's your problem.
[00:24.020 --> 00:27.360]  Yeah, I agree with Andrew. I also can't hear it, so it's fine.
[00:27.560 --> 00:28.940]  Okay. Hello?
[00:34.900 --> 00:37.120]  That was almost Tim Allen-esque by you.
[00:37.120 --> 00:39.020]  Is that correct? That was so awesome.
[00:39.140 --> 00:40.900]  God, this is great. Sorry, continue.
[00:41.680 --> 00:43.120]  Hello. Hello.
[00:43.620 --> 00:45.980]  And welcome to another episode of the...
[00:45.980 --> 00:46.220]  I'm rolling. What?
[00:48.520 --> 00:48.880]  What?
[00:49.060 --> 00:51.560]  I wasn't sure if I was rolling, so I was just double...
[00:51.560 --> 00:53.420]  I was confirming. Did you decide to say it out loud
[00:53.420 --> 00:54.320]  while I'm doing the intro?
[00:54.880 --> 00:56.960]  Well, I asked, am I rolling, and then said...
[00:56.960 --> 00:59.820]  Who are you asking? I was just talking out loud.
[01:00.240 --> 01:00.780]  Who did you ask?
[01:00.780 --> 01:03.080]  Okay, we're not asking Gavin. I have an outer monologue.
[01:03.380 --> 01:04.660]  I talk. Talk to myself.
[01:05.420 --> 01:06.720]  Talk in your brain!
[01:07.500 --> 01:08.960]  Oh, my God.
[01:09.440 --> 01:11.580]  Hello, and welcome to another episode
[01:11.580 --> 01:13.300]  of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:13.700 --> 01:15.540]  This is number 178.
[01:15.620 --> 01:17.740]  My name is Geoff. There's an Andrew and a Gavin
[01:17.740 --> 01:19.240]  somewhere. Here we go.
[01:19.680 --> 01:20.860]  Now, that was a memorable intro.
[01:21.200 --> 01:23.320]  I have a question about the censorship of our
[01:23.320 --> 01:25.340]  podcast name. If you're
[01:25.340 --> 01:27.320]  halfway through saying F*** Face,
[01:27.720 --> 01:29.820]  does it still bleep if you don't say face?
[01:30.280 --> 01:31.660]  No. I feel like we established
[01:31.660 --> 01:33.000]  this on episode, like, two.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.160]  Yeah, what? We're like 200 in.
[01:35.300 --> 01:36.900]  We're almost 200 in. What's
[01:36.900 --> 01:38.720]  happening? Yeah, but have we talked about, like,
[01:38.780 --> 01:41.020]  an intent, but it didn't get
[01:41.020 --> 01:43.100]  completed? Yeah, I
[01:43.100 --> 01:45.060]  feel like we discussed this. I think if there's
[01:45.060 --> 01:47.180]  a breath between it, it's fine.
[01:47.360 --> 01:49.040]  You're saying f*** and you're saying face.
[01:49.380 --> 01:50.620]  It's two separate words.
[01:51.280 --> 01:53.080]  If you say it in one breath, f*** face,
[01:53.160 --> 01:54.880]  that's probably gonna get edited, but if you say
[01:54.880 --> 01:57.100]  f*** face...
[01:57.100 --> 01:58.060]  Okay, I'm just checking.
[01:58.920 --> 02:01.220]  You intended to say it there, but you didn't
[02:01.220 --> 02:03.160]  say face. So, I don't
[02:03.160 --> 02:04.840]  think we covered it, but
[02:04.840 --> 02:07.160]  Gavin wanted to kill Andrew
[02:07.160 --> 02:09.140]  by strangling him
[02:09.140 --> 02:10.620]  from behind with a towel,
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.120]  but then looking in a mirror, so he
[02:13.120 --> 02:15.140]  still made eye contact, but he
[02:15.140 --> 02:16.980]  felt like there'd be a degree of separation.
[02:17.380 --> 02:19.020]  Oh, because eye contact was ruined.
[02:19.100 --> 02:20.880]  I didn't think I could have taken
[02:20.880 --> 02:22.920]  looking into your eyes while doing it.
[02:23.600 --> 02:25.180]  But looking into your eyes through
[02:25.180 --> 02:26.600]  a mirror, he thinks would be fine.
[02:27.140 --> 02:29.100]  It's like a separation there. A layer
[02:29.100 --> 02:31.120]  of divide. So, just to
[02:31.120 --> 02:33.100]  clarify, am I fighting for my
[02:33.100 --> 02:35.060]  life every time you're strangling me
[02:35.060 --> 02:37.440]  to death? Am I willingly letting you choke me?
[02:37.580 --> 02:39.340]  No, and you, well, you argue.
[02:39.480 --> 02:41.200]  You're like, please don't do this. This is gonna hurt.
[02:41.320 --> 02:43.080]  I know what I said yesterday. I know
[02:43.080 --> 02:44.560]  I told you it's not a big deal. No, but
[02:44.560 --> 02:47.120]  am I trying to fight you off? Like, obviously, I'm not
[02:47.120 --> 02:49.200]  gonna hurt you, but am I trying to prevent
[02:49.200 --> 02:51.240]  this from happening? Oh, I think you should.
[02:53.760 --> 02:55.040]  I would like to...
[02:55.040 --> 02:57.020]  You know, I gotta be honest, we never
[02:57.020 --> 02:58.440]  considered it being a fight.
[03:01.480 --> 03:03.080]  I just want to say I've been
[03:03.080 --> 03:04.780]  thinking about this a little bit. I've got
[03:04.780 --> 03:07.160]  a tree trunk of a neck, okay?
[03:07.300 --> 03:08.660]  It's gonna be a difficult
[03:08.660 --> 03:11.220]  job. I think you're greatly
[03:12.640 --> 03:13.080]  underestimating
[03:13.080 --> 03:14.620]  how much time it would take
[03:14.620 --> 03:16.820]  and how exhausting of a process
[03:16.820 --> 03:18.940]  it would be for you to physically
[03:18.940 --> 03:21.120]  have to do this. How were you gonna do it,
[03:21.180 --> 03:22.920]  Gavin? You were gonna use a towel, then you were gonna
[03:22.920 --> 03:25.120]  wrap it around a, like a wooden spoon
[03:25.120 --> 03:26.940]  or something so you could twist? I think, yeah,
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.080]  because I was worried about my ability just to go
[03:29.080 --> 03:31.100]  with my hands. Like, I don't think I'm strong enough. I don't
[03:31.100 --> 03:33.080]  think I have the grip strength. Yeah, I don't think you could
[03:33.080 --> 03:35.080]  strangle me with your hands. So I think what I was gonna do is
[03:35.080 --> 03:37.020]  I was gonna take either end of a towel
[03:37.020 --> 03:39.160]  and sort of swirl it until it's
[03:39.160 --> 03:41.200]  like a, you know, pool noodle-esque.
[03:41.660 --> 03:43.180]  And then I was gonna wrap that around,
[03:43.500 --> 03:45.320]  right? Then get a wooden spoon
[03:45.320 --> 03:47.040]  and lodge that in the ends
[03:47.040 --> 03:49.280]  and then use the spoon as, like, a twisting
[03:49.280 --> 03:51.480]  mechanism to sort of, like, crank
[03:52.020 --> 03:53.080]  the towel tight,
[03:53.080 --> 03:55.300]  if you know what I mean. While looking at you
[03:55.300 --> 03:57.180]  in the eyes through a mirror. Now, how do you
[03:57.180 --> 03:59.420]  feel about that, Andrew? I...
[03:59.420 --> 04:01.080]  I don't know if the towel...
[04:01.080 --> 04:03.060]  I think the towel would provide less
[04:03.060 --> 04:05.080]  tension than you would think. I
[04:05.080 --> 04:06.380]  think I could survive
[04:07.300 --> 04:09.040]  you doing that with a towel.
[04:09.720 --> 04:11.140]  Okay. I think
[04:11.140 --> 04:13.040]  the whole layer that none of you
[04:13.040 --> 04:14.940]  considered is how difficult
[04:14.940 --> 04:17.080]  it's gonna be to strangle me. Because much
[04:17.080 --> 04:19.280]  like my unbreakable nose, I think
[04:19.280 --> 04:21.320]  that I have a very un-chokeable
[04:21.320 --> 04:23.080]  neck. It's a very
[04:23.980 --> 04:25.240]  thick... This was something
[04:25.240 --> 04:27.320]  I was gonna bring up. Do you think
[04:27.320 --> 04:29.260]  if you described Andrew the
[04:29.260 --> 04:30.840]  way we described Ian,
[04:31.320 --> 04:33.140]  people would be able to draw him
[04:33.140 --> 04:35.320]  unbreakable nose, tree trunk
[04:35.960 --> 04:37.520]  neck, longest back?
[04:37.660 --> 04:38.080]  All back.
[04:41.420 --> 04:43.220]  Yeah, I mean, as soon as
[04:43.220 --> 04:44.980]  Geoff presented this scenario,
[04:45.920 --> 04:47.300]  I immediately didn't
[04:47.300 --> 04:49.140]  think I'd be strong enough to do it with my bare hands.
[04:49.140 --> 04:50.900]  Yeah, and for the record,
[04:51.020 --> 04:53.220]  I didn't want to strangle you. I was happy to shoot you
[04:53.220 --> 04:55.240]  every day, as opposed to strangle you 12 times.
[04:55.360 --> 04:57.040]  Yeah, the bullet would be a problem.
[04:57.460 --> 04:58.900]  I can't... there's nothing...
[04:58.900 --> 05:01.120]  I think it would be really hard to shoot
[05:01.120 --> 05:02.780]  you for a while.
[05:03.200 --> 05:04.840]  But, like, by month three,
[05:05.140 --> 05:07.120]  it's like brushing your teeth, probably.
[05:07.560 --> 05:09.060]  And so I figured you would get
[05:09.060 --> 05:11.020]  used to it a lot faster than you would get used to the
[05:11.020 --> 05:13.140]  12 stranglings. Because then you have to think
[05:13.140 --> 05:15.000]  about it all month long. You're like, oh god,
[05:15.120 --> 05:16.400]  is it the 20th?
[05:16.400 --> 05:18.360]  Oh, rent's gonna be due, I gotta
[05:18.360 --> 05:19.940]  strangle Andrew...
[05:19.940 --> 05:22.360]  Is it tax month? You know what I mean?
[05:22.400 --> 05:23.680]  Like, that shit would weigh on you.
[05:24.020 --> 05:26.620]  Once again, you're not factoring in my perspective
[05:26.620 --> 05:28.020]  of fighting this.
[05:28.240 --> 05:30.440]  I would get really mad and be like, I'm gonna make
[05:30.440 --> 05:32.460]  this fucker take all day if he's gonna
[05:32.460 --> 05:34.080]  try this. All day.
[05:34.680 --> 05:36.500]  Do you think you could, like, clench your neck
[05:36.500 --> 05:38.380]  muscles and really try and prevent it?
[05:38.460 --> 05:39.320]  Oh, absolutely!
[05:39.880 --> 05:42.440]  I got some pretty big shoulders. I could turtle this
[05:42.440 --> 05:44.400]  neck. I could go to the shell to
[05:44.400 --> 05:46.420]  reduce the neck area, the thickness
[05:46.420 --> 05:48.340]  of the neck, even if you got your hands on there, it's gonna
[05:48.340 --> 05:50.420]  be exhausting. So do you think you actually
[05:50.420 --> 05:52.400]  have a girthier neck? Like, if
[05:52.400 --> 05:54.420]  we measured your neck, would it be... Yeah, I think
[05:54.420 --> 05:55.980]  I got a girth neck. Absolutely.
[05:57.160 --> 05:58.380]  I think... this is
[05:58.380 --> 06:00.720]  something I've thought about a lot. Now, if you use tools,
[06:01.180 --> 06:02.360]  I think you could choke me
[06:02.360 --> 06:04.400]  out, but I think that, like, if you were
[06:04.400 --> 06:06.760]  to put me in, like, uh...
[06:06.760 --> 06:08.380]  what would be...
[06:08.380 --> 06:10.320]  I'm trying to remember the name for the choke, but there's
[06:10.320 --> 06:12.380]  different chokes that I think I'd be
[06:12.380 --> 06:14.040]  very resistant to. Arty?
[06:14.280 --> 06:16.420]  And I know a lot of them are actually based on, like,
[06:16.660 --> 06:18.420]  cutting off circulation, which
[06:18.420 --> 06:20.460]  causes it, but I just think I got, like, a
[06:20.460 --> 06:22.400]  really girthy neck. Do you think
[06:22.400 --> 06:24.460]  if we put something constrictive around
[06:24.460 --> 06:26.320]  your neck and you flexed it hard enough, you
[06:26.320 --> 06:28.400]  could snap it? I don't think I could snap it,
[06:28.420 --> 06:30.560]  but I think I could generate enough space
[06:30.560 --> 06:32.360]  for me to continue the blood flow, as
[06:32.360 --> 06:34.240]  well as, like, gargle breathe.
[06:34.640 --> 06:36.360]  That'd be such a cool moment in a movie,
[06:36.440 --> 06:38.260]  though, if someone was in the middle
[06:38.260 --> 06:40.240]  of the towel slash wooden
[06:40.240 --> 06:42.280]  spoon choke, and then they just
[06:42.280 --> 06:44.360]  flex their neck and the spoon exploded.
[06:44.720 --> 06:46.380]  Do you think if a
[06:46.380 --> 06:48.180]  boa constrictor tried to constrict
[06:48.180 --> 06:50.340]  your neck, but you were ready for it,
[06:50.340 --> 06:52.240]  that you could, like...
[06:53.060 --> 06:54.040]  No. Prevent?
[06:54.120 --> 06:56.080]  The answer's no. Because
[06:56.080 --> 06:58.100]  a boa constrictor, their whole thing is
[06:58.100 --> 07:00.120]  constricting. That's their life.
[07:00.660 --> 07:02.100]  A human, generally
[07:02.100 --> 07:04.400]  speaking, their whole thing is not strangulation.
[07:04.940 --> 07:06.300]  So I think there's
[07:06.300 --> 07:08.200]  a level of fatigue that a person would
[07:08.200 --> 07:10.260]  face that the boa constrictor would not.
[07:10.500 --> 07:12.340]  Well, the Boston Strangler and the Hillside
[07:12.340 --> 07:14.160]  Strangler, there's been a few people who their
[07:14.160 --> 07:16.360]  whole lives was strangling. Yeah, there's a few human
[07:16.360 --> 07:18.260]  constrictors. Yeah, but I would like
[07:18.260 --> 07:20.180]  to size up the girthiness
[07:20.180 --> 07:22.040]  of those necks that the Boston Strangler
[07:22.040 --> 07:23.380]  was going after. I bet you
[07:23.980 --> 07:26.420]  he went for very pencil-like necks.
[07:26.820 --> 07:28.180]  The idea of just
[07:28.180 --> 07:30.060]  sneaking up behind you and then grabbing it,
[07:30.100 --> 07:31.420]  just going, oh, shit.
[07:32.220 --> 07:33.520]  Oh, shit! Come on!
[07:33.880 --> 07:35.880]  You think the Boston Strangler's lady's like,
[07:35.880 --> 07:37.900]  that is not a neck. I can't handle that neck.
[07:38.660 --> 07:39.620]  No, yeah.
[07:39.760 --> 07:41.500]  I would feel fine in that environment.
[07:42.420 --> 07:43.880]  There's so many. He would have
[07:43.880 --> 07:45.920]  to take out 99% of the necks
[07:45.920 --> 07:47.540]  before he even considered going to mine.
[07:47.760 --> 07:49.840]  I think that's fair. Yeah.
[07:50.240 --> 07:51.900]  I've thought about this. I've thought about this
[07:51.900 --> 07:53.740]  outside of this show, like outside of this
[07:53.740 --> 07:55.840]  conversation. That's a random thing
[07:55.840 --> 07:57.940]  that I should have brought up. I have a very thick
[07:57.940 --> 07:59.860]  neck. Your neck is still not
[07:59.860 --> 08:01.880]  as wide as your head, though. Well, I mean
[08:01.880 --> 08:03.360]  that's fucking, that's a huge
[08:04.120 --> 08:05.700]  that's a huge thing you're describing.
[08:05.840 --> 08:07.640]  But it's big enough
[08:07.640 --> 08:09.640]  to support his head. That's a great
[08:09.640 --> 08:11.640]  point. Yeah. Which is probably what
[08:11.640 --> 08:13.540]  makes it so goddamn strong
[08:13.540 --> 08:15.500]  and sturdy. He's got, Andrew
[08:15.500 --> 08:16.920]  has got a lot of brain.
[08:17.520 --> 08:19.640]  You opened a mini helmet recently
[08:19.640 --> 08:21.360]  in the Break Show and I had the realization
[08:21.360 --> 08:23.340]  that any helmet to me is a mini helmet.
[08:23.740 --> 08:25.720]  That's like a baby
[08:25.720 --> 08:27.420]  helmet is what that actually is
[08:27.420 --> 08:29.480]  in the context of my head scale. I don't know
[08:29.480 --> 08:31.400]  what I was expecting opening up that middle
[08:31.400 --> 08:33.480]  that mini helmet on the Break Show
[08:33.480 --> 08:35.740]  but very underwhelming.
[08:35.880 --> 08:37.560]  I won't be buying any more mini helmets.
[08:37.700 --> 08:39.720]  I'm definitely not a mini helmet collector.
[08:39.920 --> 08:41.540]  It felt like a cheap plastic
[08:41.540 --> 08:43.480]  piece of crap. It was like what
[08:43.480 --> 08:45.460]  they serve, not even like
[08:45.460 --> 08:47.680]  the nachos, it's what they serve
[08:47.680 --> 08:49.440]  the little ice cream scoop in
[08:49.440 --> 08:51.440]  at a baseball game. Cause we're making
[08:51.440 --> 08:53.460]  the nacho helmet for f***face, right? And it's
[08:53.460 --> 08:55.300]  way nicer. Yeah, oh yeah.
[08:55.420 --> 08:57.160]  We're making a f***face nacho helmet.
[08:57.400 --> 08:59.480]  It's way nicer than the one
[08:59.480 --> 09:01.480]  that I just paid 120 bucks
[09:01.480 --> 09:03.500]  for or whatever. Yeah, absolutely. And maybe we'll
[09:03.500 --> 09:05.380]  sign some. Gavin, we made this
[09:05.380 --> 09:07.420]  nacho helmet just in case you needed nachos.
[09:07.740 --> 09:09.300]  That's true. Okay. Will you sign some?
[09:09.660 --> 09:11.420]  Yeah. Will you eat nachos out of one?
[09:11.720 --> 09:13.120]  Yeah. Interesting.
[09:13.400 --> 09:15.440]  Why wouldn't I? I don't know.
[09:15.520 --> 09:16.940]  That's why I'm asking. I'm just asking.
[09:17.440 --> 09:18.520]  Just asking questions, man.
[09:20.400 --> 09:21.400]  Who do you think has
[09:21.400 --> 09:23.580]  the heaviest head? Do you think Andrew has the heaviest
[09:23.580 --> 09:24.920]  head? Oh, easily. Yeah.
[09:25.960 --> 09:27.380]  Absolutely. I think I have both
[09:27.380 --> 09:28.900]  the heaviest and the most hollow.
[09:29.760 --> 09:31.500]  Wait, what? What? I got a lot
[09:31.500 --> 09:33.320]  of room in there. I have a very knockable
[09:33.320 --> 09:35.760]  head. But an unbreakable
[09:35.760 --> 09:37.540]  nose and all back.
[09:38.440 --> 09:39.340]  One day we're all gonna
[09:39.340 --> 09:41.440]  get together. When we get together, hugs
[09:41.440 --> 09:43.420]  and all that, then you guys are gonna knock on my
[09:43.420 --> 09:45.600]  head and be like, wow, this is like, this is a dome.
[09:45.740 --> 09:47.280]  You got a dome in there. So you're saying
[09:47.280 --> 09:49.240]  you have the most empty head
[09:49.240 --> 09:51.460]  but most massive head. Yeah, well, like
[09:51.460 --> 09:52.620]  if you knock on it,
[09:53.080 --> 09:55.320]  the sound travels. The acoustics
[09:55.320 --> 09:57.080]  in my skull are
[09:57.080 --> 09:59.300]  second to none. It's bouncing
[09:59.300 --> 10:01.080]  off the walls. You're gonna see.
[10:01.680 --> 10:03.220]  You'll just see. How am I gonna
[10:03.220 --> 10:04.780]  see? Well, I'm saying
[10:05.240 --> 10:07.160]  eventually we're all gonna get together, hugs and all that.
[10:07.220 --> 10:09.300]  After we do all the hugs, Gavin, you can
[10:09.300 --> 10:11.320]  try to strangle me and then you guys
[10:11.320 --> 10:13.140]  can all knock on my head like it's a door
[10:13.140 --> 10:14.680]  and it will, the sound
[10:15.400 --> 10:16.760]  the sound it makes.
[10:17.680 --> 10:19.320]  I want you to know, Andrew, I don't
[10:19.320 --> 10:21.320]  actually want to strangle you. You say that
[10:21.320 --> 10:23.320]  but then you create a hypothetical in which you
[10:23.320 --> 10:25.280]  have to. I didn't create shit. And then you spend
[10:25.280 --> 10:27.600]  you spend all weekend. I adapted
[10:27.600 --> 10:29.460]  it. I'm pretty sure you created that hypothetical.
[10:29.840 --> 10:31.260]  Yeah, and then when somebody picked
[10:31.260 --> 10:33.360]  the one that you didn't like that they picked, you made
[10:33.360 --> 10:35.180]  sure that you kept putting
[10:35.180 --> 10:37.180]  things on that one to make sure they
[10:37.180 --> 10:39.220]  picked the one that you wanted them to. Yeah, but my
[10:39.220 --> 10:40.620]  one was dogs and nosebleeds.
[10:41.180 --> 10:43.160]  Geoff's one was Andrew. I don't think it was.
[10:43.220 --> 10:45.080]  I don't remember it that way. Oh, okay.
[10:45.480 --> 10:47.400]  Shh. Okay. Oh, so it's
[10:47.400 --> 10:49.280]  Geoff. It's all kind of hazy. After you had
[10:49.280 --> 10:51.220]  to take a picture with your worms and dirt, it's all
[10:51.220 --> 10:53.220]  kind of hazy. Oh, no, this is okay. It's
[10:53.220 --> 10:55.260]  Geoff's fault. Gavin, I was about to talk shit
[10:55.260 --> 10:57.140]  to you. I was about to say I'm going to turn your gold hands
[10:57.140 --> 10:59.240]  into dog shit hands after people see
[10:59.240 --> 11:01.260]  your lack of strangle ability on my
[11:01.260 --> 11:02.400]  neck. But now it's a Geoff thing.
[11:02.700 --> 11:05.120]  Don't listen. There's fucking three people
[11:05.120 --> 11:06.940]  who were there and two of us can't remember.
[11:08.160 --> 11:09.220]  Don't fake news
[11:09.220 --> 11:11.200]  me into this being Geoff's fault. Eric and
[11:11.200 --> 11:13.040]  I remember it a little differently. We already
[11:13.040 --> 11:15.180]  established that Geoff had shitty hands
[11:15.180 --> 11:15.820]  last week.
[11:17.020 --> 11:19.080]  I've seen, well I haven't seen it, but I've heard
[11:19.080 --> 11:21.280]  Geoff throws like 25 baseball.
[11:21.440 --> 11:22.440]  I'm not scared of those hands.
[11:22.600 --> 11:24.100]  There's no power in those hands.
[11:24.920 --> 11:26.360]  What are you talking about?
[11:27.580 --> 11:29.000]  Also, I never wanted
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.880]  to strangle you.
[11:31.140 --> 11:32.240]  I wanted to shoot you.
[11:32.860 --> 11:34.820]  I think the strangling thing is way too personal.
[11:35.640 --> 11:37.260]  And I would never have even attempted
[11:37.260 --> 11:37.760]  it.
[11:39.300 --> 11:40.340]  Now let me
[11:40.960 --> 11:43.080]  ask you a question. You think you have the heaviest head.
[11:43.480 --> 11:45.060]  Who do you think amongst us has the
[11:45.060 --> 11:45.960]  heaviest thoughts?
[11:45.960 --> 11:48.220]  Because I think it's me.
[11:48.540 --> 11:49.660]  Oh, it's definitely you.
[11:49.760 --> 11:51.080]  You immediately came to mind.
[11:51.100 --> 11:53.940]  Not in the sense of like, they're great
[11:53.940 --> 11:55.980]  thoughts, but there's a lot
[11:55.980 --> 11:56.440]  of sadness.
[11:56.800 --> 11:59.920]  They're all dark thoughts.
[12:00.380 --> 12:01.560]  Sort of like,
[12:01.900 --> 12:03.720]  they're like really just
[12:03.720 --> 12:05.920]  dark marbles inside your head that
[12:05.920 --> 12:06.760]  weigh so much.
[12:07.300 --> 12:09.000]  It's like a War and Peace
[12:09.840 --> 12:11.740]  sized novel of dark thoughts
[12:11.740 --> 12:13.860]  that just rattle around at all times.
[12:13.860 --> 12:15.980]  The weight and type of thought that makes
[12:15.980 --> 12:17.600]  you consider either
[12:17.600 --> 12:19.900]  strangling or shooting one of your closest
[12:19.900 --> 12:21.500]  friends. Those kind of heavy,
[12:21.660 --> 12:22.500]  dark thoughts.
[12:22.820 --> 12:25.860]  Do you guys have contingency plans on how
[12:25.860 --> 12:27.600]  to kill all of us around you?
[12:27.800 --> 12:29.840]  No. Never thought of it.
[12:29.880 --> 12:30.800]  What are you talking about?
[12:30.940 --> 12:33.820]  I read a Justice League comic once when I was
[12:33.820 --> 12:35.900]  in high school, and in it
[12:35.900 --> 12:37.620]  they were talking about who
[12:37.620 --> 12:39.840]  was the baddest member of the
[12:39.840 --> 12:41.960]  Justice League, and it was determined that Batman
[12:41.960 --> 12:44.080]  is the most dangerous member of the Justice
[12:44.080 --> 12:45.500]  League, even though he doesn't have powers,
[12:45.980 --> 12:48.280]  because he has a contingency plan
[12:48.280 --> 12:49.900]  to kill every other
[12:49.900 --> 12:51.820]  member of the Justice League if they go evil
[12:51.820 --> 12:53.880]  or rogue. Like, Superman's a good guy,
[12:53.980 --> 12:56.000]  but if Superman goes dark, Batman has to
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.980]  be prepared to take him out. Same with Wonder Woman,
[12:58.120 --> 12:59.920]  same with Aquaman, same with everybody. So I
[12:59.920 --> 13:01.840]  have always thought, I should probably have a
[13:01.840 --> 13:03.700]  contingency plan, just in case things go wrong,
[13:03.840 --> 13:05.580]  on how to get rid of everybody around me.
[13:05.800 --> 13:07.920]  Couldn't Superman just fly through the
[13:07.920 --> 13:09.900]  Earth, though? Yeah, Batman's got
[13:09.900 --> 13:11.360]  a contingency plan for that. Yeah, he
[13:11.940 --> 13:14.380]  makes his skin transparent so he can't
[13:15.060 --> 13:15.780]  get the
[13:16.360 --> 13:17.980]  rays from the sun, I think, was
[13:17.980 --> 13:18.720]  the way he did that.
[13:20.160 --> 13:21.960]  He could do Dark Knight Returns, you just
[13:21.960 --> 13:23.940]  build a suit out of kryptonite and just beat the shit
[13:23.940 --> 13:24.560]  out of him. That's true.
[13:25.720 --> 13:27.860]  What would be us going evil, like, what does
[13:27.860 --> 13:30.020]  us going evil mean, in the context of this
[13:30.020 --> 13:31.440]  show? I don't want to find out.
[13:31.560 --> 13:33.920]  The only thing that I can immediately think of
[13:33.920 --> 13:35.760]  is going rogue is like maybe making other
[13:35.760 --> 13:37.380]  podcasts, and you've got like seven of those.
[13:37.380 --> 13:39.400]  You're the most rogue. I'm not
[13:39.400 --> 13:41.480]  gonna kill anybody for making another podcast.
[13:41.600 --> 13:43.320]  I hope not, because you have seven of them.
[13:43.380 --> 13:44.960]  Oh girl, you've got so many podcasts.
[13:44.960 --> 13:46.860]  I do not, I have three. That's your standard.
[13:47.080 --> 13:49.200]  I have three fucking podcasts, that's all.
[13:49.320 --> 13:50.920]  That's more than most people have.
[13:51.180 --> 13:53.500]  But I make them all with people in this
[13:53.500 --> 13:55.440]  podcast, like Eric is involved with all three of them.
[13:55.620 --> 13:56.700]  And Nick. Yeah.
[13:57.020 --> 13:59.020]  Thanks, Nick. You know, okay, yeah,
[13:59.820 --> 14:00.600]  we'll say yes.
[14:01.180 --> 14:03.180]  You produce them. I'm just saying,
[14:03.240 --> 14:05.320]  so alright is really a one-man effort.
[14:05.320 --> 14:05.940]  That's all I'm saying.
[14:07.560 --> 14:08.380]  That's unfair.
[14:08.860 --> 14:11.200]  That's unfair to Nick and Gracie and everybody
[14:11.200 --> 14:13.160]  involved, and Kelly, that are involved.
[14:13.480 --> 14:15.520]  How dare you? It's a group effort.
[14:15.900 --> 14:17.420]  I'm sorry, Nick. I'm sorry about that.
[14:17.640 --> 14:19.040]  Andrew, how many podcasts do you have?
[14:19.300 --> 14:20.620]  One. Okay, cool, just checking.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.360]  One for me. Anyway, nobody's killing anybody
[14:23.360 --> 14:24.760]  about making rogue podcasts.
[14:24.960 --> 14:27.360]  I was thinking more of like you're just going evil
[14:27.360 --> 14:29.260]  evil. Like Columbine evil.
[14:29.780 --> 14:31.560]  You know? Jesus Christ.
[14:31.620 --> 14:33.320]  What are you...
[14:33.320 --> 14:34.800]  You have the heaviest thoughts.
[14:34.880 --> 14:36.400]  What's wrong with you?
[14:37.080 --> 14:38.880]  What the fuck? You'll be
[14:38.880 --> 14:40.520]  48 someday, and you'll
[14:40.520 --> 14:42.620]  accumulate your heavy thoughts too.
[14:43.000 --> 14:44.940]  I think the worst part, well not the worst,
[14:45.200 --> 14:46.940]  but I think an amusing part of that
[14:46.940 --> 14:48.820]  is it also shows how old Geoff is.
[14:49.200 --> 14:51.060]  That is such a dated shooting to reference.
[14:51.780 --> 14:53.200]  There's so many more relevant ones.
[14:53.720 --> 14:55.000]  You really dated yourself there.
[14:55.060 --> 14:57.240]  A lot more recent. Of course,
[14:57.400 --> 14:59.120]  but that's the one that imprinted
[14:59.120 --> 15:01.000]  on me because I was, you know,
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.420]  in high school or whatever when that happened.
[15:02.760 --> 15:04.440]  It's probably also the one that imprinted on
[15:04.440 --> 15:06.780]  all the other bastards who tried it.
[15:06.940 --> 15:08.780]  That's true. I'm not going to make assumptions
[15:08.780 --> 15:10.440]  about them. That's fair too.
[15:11.220 --> 15:12.860]  I don't want to be in that space.
[15:13.300 --> 15:13.940]  I'm going to move on.
[15:14.520 --> 15:16.740]  On a slightly lighter note,
[15:17.560 --> 15:19.220]  Gavin and I hung out this morning.
[15:19.600 --> 15:20.600]  We started a new thing.
[15:21.420 --> 15:23.000]  Pleasantries. Oh, now I'm hurt.
[15:23.220 --> 15:25.080]  We just started
[15:25.080 --> 15:26.080]  a little coffee club.
[15:26.960 --> 15:29.100]  We got coffee at like 9am this morning.
[15:29.780 --> 15:30.220]  Okay.
[15:31.640 --> 15:32.080]  Congrats.
[15:34.600 --> 15:37.240]  You guys have been friends for like 20 years.
[15:37.480 --> 15:38.720]  We would have invited you.
[15:38.780 --> 15:40.700]  You live in Canada.
[15:41.880 --> 15:43.040]  I've never heard Andrew
[15:43.040 --> 15:45.080]  say fuck you, but I think he just did.
[15:46.920 --> 15:48.980]  I'm happy for you guys, but you guys are
[15:48.980 --> 15:51.100]  best friends. You've known each other
[15:51.100 --> 15:52.060]  for 20 years.
[15:52.680 --> 15:55.140]  Look at how zany we are. We're getting coffee in the morning.
[15:55.160 --> 15:56.840]  Dude, I just
[15:56.840 --> 15:58.720]  made a So Alright podcast
[15:58.720 --> 16:00.900]  about how little I spend time
[16:00.900 --> 16:01.460]  with Gavin.
[16:03.120 --> 16:04.780]  Gavin and Eric
[16:04.780 --> 16:06.720]  and I realized it was the first time
[16:06.720 --> 16:08.720]  I'd gotten lunch with Gavin in six
[16:08.720 --> 16:10.840]  years. So getting coffee
[16:10.840 --> 16:12.820]  with Gavin is also a big fucking deal
[16:12.820 --> 16:14.120]  to me. I loved it.
[16:14.520 --> 16:16.700]  It was a bit loud in there though. My back was to the
[16:16.700 --> 16:18.660]  checkout. Of course you did.
[16:19.000 --> 16:20.860]  You guys are best friends. Why wouldn't you love it?
[16:22.660 --> 16:23.900]  What are you talking about?
[16:24.680 --> 16:26.080]  He calls his best friends
[16:26.080 --> 16:27.000]  like it's an insult.
[16:27.500 --> 16:29.160]  It's like there's venom behind it.
[16:29.320 --> 16:31.920]  You're like, oh, we had coffee together. Crazy.
[16:32.220 --> 16:33.920]  You know, I got together with one of my
[16:33.920 --> 16:35.740]  closest friends and I don't know if you'll believe it.
[16:35.920 --> 16:36.900]  We had a good time.
[16:37.640 --> 16:39.640]  I didn't say I didn't think you'd believe it.
[16:39.700 --> 16:42.040]  I just said on a lighter note it was nice to get coffee
[16:42.040 --> 16:44.020]  with Gavin. It is a lighter note.
[16:44.120 --> 16:45.480]  I'll give you that. That is correct.
[16:45.940 --> 16:47.540]  I'm happy. How was the coffee?
[16:47.640 --> 16:48.040]  Was it good?
[16:50.080 --> 16:51.240]  Real fucking thrilling.
[16:51.240 --> 16:52.960]  Did you have a decaf?
[16:53.380 --> 16:55.240]  It was just better than Columbine, alright?
[16:55.700 --> 16:57.460]  It was. I'd hope so.
[16:57.720 --> 16:59.300]  There was zero talk about
[16:59.300 --> 17:00.900]  strangling you all coffee long.
[17:01.120 --> 17:03.500]  That's great. I support this.
[17:03.700 --> 17:05.160]  More coffee is what I say.
[17:05.300 --> 17:07.180]  You're making it sound like we spend so much time
[17:07.180 --> 17:09.220]  talking about strangling. You know what happened
[17:09.220 --> 17:11.160]  that we didn't address last time? It's that
[17:11.160 --> 17:13.280]  after Eric touched the silver and got cursed
[17:13.280 --> 17:14.640]  by the water
[17:15.620 --> 17:16.460]  and almost
[17:17.700 --> 17:18.820]  drowned in the shower.
[17:18.820 --> 17:20.840]  I forgot to bring up
[17:20.840 --> 17:23.000]  as well that we went to the Admirals
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.180]  Club on the way home.
[17:25.320 --> 17:26.100]  Oh yeah.
[17:26.380 --> 17:29.020]  And Eric choked on a drink
[17:29.020 --> 17:30.740]  of water in the middle of the Admirals Club.
[17:32.360 --> 17:35.000]  And that caused me to spit
[17:35.000 --> 17:36.700]  coffee. It was like right
[17:36.700 --> 17:39.000]  as I was saying. I almost spit coffee on Eric's
[17:39.000 --> 17:40.500]  small wife because Eric was
[17:40.500 --> 17:42.940]  choking on water.
[17:43.300 --> 17:44.920]  Water was trying to get me one more
[17:44.920 --> 17:46.820]  time before we were like really truly done
[17:46.820 --> 17:47.440]  with the vacation.
[17:49.640 --> 17:50.840]  I had to get up
[17:50.840 --> 17:52.760]  and walk away for about a minute because I
[17:52.760 --> 17:54.800]  couldn't swallow the
[17:54.800 --> 17:55.840]  coffee that was in my mouth.
[17:56.200 --> 17:58.940]  It was like sputtering out and I was like oh my god
[17:58.940 --> 18:00.880]  the second it started going down my
[18:00.880 --> 18:02.180]  gullet he choked and I was just
[18:02.820 --> 18:04.900]  locked in my mouth for like 45 seconds.
[18:05.100 --> 18:06.740]  We went to the Admirals
[18:06.740 --> 18:08.760]  Club once on the way there
[18:08.760 --> 18:10.840]  once on the way back and both
[18:10.840 --> 18:13.080]  times we ate cubes of pale cheese
[18:13.080 --> 18:13.700]  and
[18:15.120 --> 18:15.640]  when
[18:15.640 --> 18:17.840]  I boarded with Gavin
[18:17.840 --> 18:19.940]  he was group one
[18:19.940 --> 18:21.680]  and I was group six
[18:21.680 --> 18:23.860]  and my wife was group
[18:23.860 --> 18:26.120]  seven. She refused
[18:26.120 --> 18:27.920]  to board with
[18:27.920 --> 18:29.880]  me and Gavin in group one
[18:29.880 --> 18:31.920]  because she thought she was going to get
[18:31.920 --> 18:33.900]  in trouble. And I was like look
[18:33.900 --> 18:35.920]  I can sort you out and get
[18:35.920 --> 18:37.800]  you in the Admirals Club. I can bring two people in
[18:37.800 --> 18:39.840]  and get this. You can board with
[18:39.840 --> 18:41.620]  me too. But she wasn't
[18:41.620 --> 18:43.480]  she wasn't confident in my ability
[18:43.480 --> 18:45.720]  to get her in. I mean the first time we
[18:45.720 --> 18:47.580]  did it, I didn't know that you could just
[18:47.580 --> 18:49.640]  do that. I didn't know you could board with someone from like the
[18:49.640 --> 18:51.580]  like a higher group or whatever. Most of the
[18:51.580 --> 18:53.560]  time you can. Yeah. The first
[18:53.560 --> 18:55.500]  time it happened, Gavin went up
[18:55.500 --> 18:57.460]  to scan his pass and it was
[18:57.460 --> 18:59.300]  like a sleight of hand magic trick
[18:59.300 --> 19:01.560]  where as he was going to scan his
[19:01.560 --> 19:03.640]  pass, his phone turned off
[19:03.640 --> 19:04.880]  I blew it. I really, I
[19:05.420 --> 19:07.100]  looked like I'd never flown before.
[19:08.480 --> 19:09.140]  It was
[19:09.140 --> 19:11.140]  his phone turned off, then he
[19:11.140 --> 19:13.160]  turned it back on. Then he scanned
[19:13.160 --> 19:15.000]  then he had to open his ticket
[19:15.000 --> 19:16.640]  but he opened his credit card.
[19:17.080 --> 19:19.000]  Then he had to close his credit card. Then he opened
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.140]  his ticket. And then he scanned his ticket. And then
[19:21.140 --> 19:23.140]  I scanned my ticket. And then they went, wait, hang
[19:23.140 --> 19:25.240]  on. Gavin, that's not the right
[19:25.240 --> 19:26.900]  ticket. Yeah, because it was a connecting
[19:26.900 --> 19:29.140]  flight in Dallas. Yeah, and I was
[19:29.140 --> 19:31.100]  for Dallas to Key West, I was
[19:31.100 --> 19:32.860]  giving him the Austin to Dallas because it
[19:32.860 --> 19:35.180]  reset the one I opened. But then he
[19:35.760 --> 19:37.180]  scanned the one from Dallas
[19:37.180 --> 19:39.280]  to Key West and then it flagged
[19:39.280 --> 19:41.200]  it because it had to print out a different
[19:41.200 --> 19:42.880]  ticket because he had a different seat
[19:42.880 --> 19:45.120]  and it was like I tricked
[19:45.120 --> 19:47.360]  them into going into like boarding
[19:47.360 --> 19:49.220]  with group one. And so I was
[19:49.220 --> 19:51.140]  like, wow, that was really cool that Gavin did that.
[19:51.220 --> 19:53.120]  And then the next time, the woman
[19:53.120 --> 19:55.280]  didn't give a fuck about
[19:55.280 --> 19:57.300]  us boarding together whatsoever.
[19:57.340 --> 19:59.180]  And I went, oh, this wasn't as cool as
[19:59.180 --> 20:01.140]  I thought it was. Yeah, they don't really care.
[20:01.260 --> 20:02.780]  But yeah, I had an absolute nightmare. It was like
[20:02.780 --> 20:05.100]  it vanished the second I turned the phone
[20:05.100 --> 20:07.020]  over and then it was like, blip, credit
[20:07.020 --> 20:09.220]  card, wrong. And then it was like, blip, wrong ticket.
[20:09.320 --> 20:11.020]  I was like, shit. And I was like, blip, wrong
[20:11.020 --> 20:13.060]  seat because I got the upgrade. So we had to print
[20:13.060 --> 20:15.000]  the new one. I was like, man, and all
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.000]  the people behind me, other group ones
[20:17.000 --> 20:18.680]  were getting real huffy puffy.
[20:18.960 --> 20:20.720]  Yeah, because you're acting like a fucking idiot.
[20:21.080 --> 20:22.920]  Yeah, he was acting like a real group seven.
[20:23.080 --> 20:24.960]  That's all. And then I got really worried that
[20:24.960 --> 20:26.980]  Eric's small wife was watching from
[20:26.980 --> 20:29.040]  afar to see how it was all going. And I
[20:29.040 --> 20:30.620]  was worried that I was embarrassing myself.
[20:31.440 --> 20:33.220]  The best thing about being the group
[20:33.220 --> 20:35.180]  one and pulling previous group
[20:35.180 --> 20:37.280]  or like later groups with you is that it works
[20:37.280 --> 20:39.200]  95% of the time, but
[20:39.200 --> 20:41.160]  the 5% of the time it doesn't work.
[20:41.420 --> 20:43.180]  You still get the board as group one and
[20:43.180 --> 20:44.660]  it's just embarrassing for them.
[20:45.100 --> 20:47.300]  I've never had it not work. I've had it not work
[20:47.300 --> 20:49.320]  a couple times. My wife was really afraid
[20:49.320 --> 20:51.180]  of having it not work and having to turn
[20:51.180 --> 20:53.180]  around and wait for six more groups.
[20:53.560 --> 20:55.360]  I was so proud of her though when she
[20:55.360 --> 20:56.740]  when she finally did it.
[20:56.840 --> 20:59.180]  She finally did it on the last part and
[20:59.180 --> 21:00.820]  she didn't think that it was possible. She
[21:00.820 --> 21:02.520]  just kept going, I'm gonna do it.
[21:03.080 --> 21:04.600]  And I asked her
[21:04.600 --> 21:06.600]  after we were walking down the jet bridge
[21:06.600 --> 21:08.620]  after we boarded, I was like
[21:09.180 --> 21:10.460]  how did you feel?
[21:10.480 --> 21:11.920]  Because it worked. And she just
[21:12.820 --> 21:14.900]  puffed her arms out.
[21:15.920 --> 21:16.400]  Like
[21:16.400 --> 21:18.480]  she was
[21:18.980 --> 21:20.720]  overheated or something. Like all
[21:20.720 --> 21:22.700]  the nerves got to her all at once.
[21:22.840 --> 21:24.980]  She was like afraid. She like puffed
[21:24.980 --> 21:26.740]  out all big like a cat
[21:26.740 --> 21:28.340]  fronting on someone. It was amazing.
[21:29.320 --> 21:30.180]  She felt
[21:30.180 --> 21:30.980]  big.
[21:31.220 --> 21:34.180]  I need to ask you Eric after
[21:34.180 --> 21:36.100]  nearly dying in the shower
[21:36.100 --> 21:38.260]  and then choking in the
[21:38.260 --> 21:40.340]  Admirals Club. Have you enacted your
[21:40.340 --> 21:42.240]  contingency plan against water?
[21:42.400 --> 21:44.080]  Because it is clearly not evil
[21:44.080 --> 21:45.500]  against you.
[21:46.120 --> 21:48.440]  I figure I'm gonna strangle it
[21:48.440 --> 21:50.300]  by looking at it while I look at it
[21:50.300 --> 21:51.080]  in the mirror.
[21:52.100 --> 21:53.420]  Just see how that goes.
[21:53.880 --> 21:56.480]  The towel would actually absorb. It would be a great
[21:56.480 --> 21:58.620]  move. Yeah, yeah. You use the towel
[21:58.620 --> 22:00.660]  and it absorbs all the water
[22:00.660 --> 22:02.520]  and that's kind of like the same thing. You know what I mean?
[22:02.760 --> 22:04.340]  I would almost say it's
[22:04.340 --> 22:06.560]  even more sinister in a
[22:06.560 --> 22:08.420]  sense because you're removing it. You're taking
[22:08.420 --> 22:10.060]  if you go to the sea with a towel
[22:10.060 --> 22:12.080]  you're absorbing it from its home
[22:12.080 --> 22:14.480]  ripping it from its comfort and then
[22:14.480 --> 22:16.480]  letting it die out in the sun
[22:16.480 --> 22:17.600]  somewhere else. That's evil.
[22:18.580 --> 22:19.720]  Geoff, how would you kill Nick?
[22:21.060 --> 22:22.480]  Probably the same way I'd kill water.
[22:22.600 --> 22:24.440]  It'd be sponge related in some way.
[22:24.980 --> 22:26.720]  You think you would absorb him?
[22:27.140 --> 22:28.280]  Maybe. I don't know.
[22:29.900 --> 22:30.520]  I'll be
[22:30.520 --> 22:32.480]  honest, I
[22:32.480 --> 22:33.640]  think I'd probably just shoot him.
[22:34.460 --> 22:35.520]  A lot of people don't
[22:36.260 --> 22:38.520]  need a complicated contingency. Andrew
[22:38.520 --> 22:40.240]  does a little bit because he's
[22:40.240 --> 22:42.260]  devious, you know. And Gavin,
[22:42.400 --> 22:44.060]  you're clever, so
[22:44.860 --> 22:46.560]  I'm not gonna get into the specifics
[22:46.560 --> 22:48.260]  with y'all because I don't want to give you any ammunition
[22:48.260 --> 22:50.260]  against me. What's the point of a
[22:50.260 --> 22:51.820]  contingency plan if everybody knows it, right?
[22:51.820 --> 22:53.800]  What's the point of being a doomsday
[22:53.800 --> 22:55.860]  prepper and living off the grid on
[22:55.860 --> 22:58.060]  your boat if you take everybody
[22:58.060 --> 22:59.780]  you meet to see your doomsday
[22:59.780 --> 23:01.140]  prepping boat? Come by and see my boat!
[23:03.580 --> 23:06.040]  I think the way to kill Nick is, do you remember that
[23:06.040 --> 23:07.900]  woman that
[23:07.900 --> 23:10.000]  Walter White takes out in the last season
[23:10.000 --> 23:11.460]  of Breaking Bad by poisoning
[23:11.460 --> 23:13.640]  her coffee? Oh, Lydia? With the ricin?
[23:13.740 --> 23:15.480]  Yeah, they put it in the
[23:15.480 --> 23:17.500]  sugar that she pours in her coffee.
[23:17.760 --> 23:19.800]  Just put that in any ketchup packet
[23:19.800 --> 23:21.700]  within a five-mile radius of Nick.
[23:22.140 --> 23:23.760]  Just any condiment. So ketchup
[23:23.760 --> 23:25.500]  instead of Stevia? Yeah.
[23:26.020 --> 23:27.800]  I think the way to kill Nick is just to lock
[23:27.800 --> 23:29.500]  him in a room with too much food.
[23:29.900 --> 23:31.860]  Oh, that would do it. Oh, yeah, he would do it
[23:31.860 --> 23:33.980]  to himself. Kind of like Sloth in Se7en?
[23:34.160 --> 23:35.920]  Yeah, he would absolutely be
[23:37.080 --> 23:37.800]  the gluttony
[23:37.800 --> 23:39.900]  guy. He'd be fucked. That was a gluttony, yeah.
[23:44.640 --> 23:46.520]  I was thinking about some of the great comedy
[23:46.520 --> 23:48.480]  duos of all time. You gotta think about Abbott and
[23:48.480 --> 23:50.040]  Costello, Laurel and Hardy,
[23:50.040 --> 23:51.860]  a more modern, all-time great
[23:51.860 --> 23:53.860]  skiing in Peel, and how they were so good at
[23:53.860 --> 23:55.700]  setting up and then delivering the joke.
[23:56.840 --> 23:57.960]  And I think
[23:57.960 --> 24:00.060]  about it. You know what the perfect duo is when it
[24:00.060 --> 24:01.420]  comes to growing your own business?
[24:01.940 --> 24:03.000]  You and Shopify.

[27:11.620 --> 27:14.060]  Do you wish you could go to Willy Wonka's Candy Factory?
[27:14.460 --> 27:16.080]  Well, since that's
[27:16.080 --> 27:17.420]  not exactly possible,
[27:17.860 --> 27:19.860]  let me introduce you to the online version
[27:19.860 --> 27:21.560]  of that. Nuts.com.
[27:21.760 --> 27:23.980]  In addition to an amazing selection of nuts,
[27:24.040 --> 27:25.800]  they have tons of classic candies like
[27:25.800 --> 27:28.000]  butterscotch, fudge, and licorice.
[27:28.440 --> 27:29.800]  Honestly, Nuts.com probably
[27:29.800 --> 27:31.900]  better. In fact, I'd say definitely
[27:31.900 --> 27:33.800]  better than Willy Wonka's Candy Factory.
[27:33.800 --> 27:34.980]  I don't know why I went to say chocolate.
[27:35.520 --> 27:37.860]  They make all sorts of things at Willy Wonka, but that doesn't matter
[27:37.860 --> 27:39.360]  because we're talking about how
[27:40.080 --> 27:41.720]  delicious Nuts.com's
[27:41.720 --> 27:42.540]  products is.
[27:43.720 --> 27:45.960]  I almost said nuts are delicious, which they are,
[27:46.060 --> 27:47.680]  but also not maybe the best
[27:47.680 --> 27:49.680]  combination of words, but we're going so far
[27:49.680 --> 27:51.760]  beyond the point. Nuts.com is your
[27:51.760 --> 27:53.640]  one-stop shop for freshly roasted

[27:57.780 --> 27:59.920]  specialty flowers, and more.

[28:13.600 --> 28:15.840]  tell you how delicious those
[28:15.840 --> 28:17.360]  chocolate gummy bears are that they make.
[28:17.460 --> 28:19.700]  My favorite thing, I think. They are just so
[28:19.700 --> 28:21.720]  good. It's hard to pick a favorite because there's so many
[28:21.720 --> 28:23.160]  delicious choices to choose from.

[28:52.380 --> 28:53.720]  Hey, I don't wanna
[28:53.720 --> 28:56.100]  further incur the wrath of Andrew,
[28:56.280 --> 28:57.860]  but should we mention that we hung
[28:57.860 --> 28:59.560]  out and did something kinda cool this weekend?
[29:00.040 --> 29:02.020]  No, listen, I wanna be clear.
[29:02.320 --> 29:03.900]  It's not that I had an issue with you
[29:03.900 --> 29:05.740]  guys hanging out. I love that. I'm excited to hear.
[29:06.020 --> 29:07.880]  It just sounded like there was no point to it.
[29:07.980 --> 29:09.960]  It was the point of the story was I had fun.
[29:10.560 --> 29:11.920]  So if there's something cool
[29:11.920 --> 29:13.320]  that happened when you guys hung out, please.
[29:13.980 --> 29:15.840]  So having fun doesn't get to be
[29:15.840 --> 29:17.160]  a point? No.
[29:18.480 --> 29:19.840]  So wait, Andrew, if I just
[29:19.840 --> 29:21.760]  hung out with you this weekend...
[29:21.760 --> 29:23.900]  Yeah. If we just had fun... In person?
[29:23.900 --> 29:25.420]  If it was in person, that'd be notable.
[29:25.420 --> 29:27.440]  If it was just us playing Halo...
[29:28.080 --> 29:29.040]  Well, because we haven't
[29:29.640 --> 29:31.800]  seen each other in person in like four years.
[29:32.100 --> 29:33.000]  Well, whose fault is that?
[29:33.460 --> 29:35.500]  Yours! It's just as much yours
[29:35.500 --> 29:37.440]  as mine! You fucking are getting up
[29:37.440 --> 29:39.600]  planes all the time! What are you talking about?
[29:39.660 --> 29:40.380]  Whose fault is that?
[29:41.200 --> 29:42.220]  He's got you there.
[29:43.640 --> 29:45.680]  You've been on way more planes than I have
[29:45.680 --> 29:46.600]  in the past six years.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.500]  I'm gonna get some Monopoly money on your door
[29:49.500 --> 29:49.960]  this year.
[29:50.940 --> 29:53.540]  There's no time! There's not a lot of this year left, man.
[29:53.540 --> 29:55.580]  There's no... It's October!
[29:55.980 --> 29:57.560]  This comes out in like November.
[29:57.980 --> 29:59.360]  I'm gonna get it in your house.
[29:59.760 --> 30:01.620]  You better not fucking... You better not be
[30:01.620 --> 30:03.320]  in Canada during my wedding, Gavin.
[30:04.040 --> 30:05.600]  You have traveled
[30:06.200 --> 30:07.760]  for personal reasons
[30:07.760 --> 30:09.880]  to places much further
[30:09.880 --> 30:11.600]  than it is to my place.
[30:11.960 --> 30:13.480]  I don't want to hear this. That is my fault.
[30:13.740 --> 30:15.500]  What's further than... You've been to like
[30:15.500 --> 30:17.280]  Japan and Italy and all these fucking...
[30:17.280 --> 30:18.660]  You're traveling all over the world.
[30:19.320 --> 30:21.860]  What's further? He immediately
[30:21.860 --> 30:24.160]  named places you just went to.
[30:24.800 --> 30:25.860]  I thought you were talking
[30:25.860 --> 30:28.180]  about stuff for this. Like stuff with this group.
[30:28.520 --> 30:29.940]  What do you mean? No, I'm just
[30:29.940 --> 30:31.500]  saying you've taken personal trips
[30:33.160 --> 30:34.040]  to further...
[30:34.040 --> 30:36.040]  Listen, I'm on point today. I'm in a
[30:36.780 --> 30:38.040]  little antagonistic mood.
[30:38.840 --> 30:39.500]  You're in the zone.
[30:39.600 --> 30:41.900]  You know what happened? This is what happened.
[30:42.100 --> 30:43.760]  I was gonna tell the story before.
[30:44.100 --> 30:45.920]  I did something I haven't done in years
[30:45.920 --> 30:47.820]  and it's made me... It's brought out
[30:47.820 --> 30:49.640]  the little antagonistic side of me.
[30:49.640 --> 30:52.100]  I accidentally went into a game chat
[30:52.720 --> 30:53.760]  for the first time
[30:53.760 --> 30:55.680]  in probably like four years.
[30:56.280 --> 30:57.600]  I've been playing a lot of
[30:57.600 --> 30:59.840]  Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I like that game
[30:59.840 --> 31:01.160]  and I've been trying to get achievements in it.
[31:02.220 --> 31:03.380]  It's a game that
[31:03.980 --> 31:05.520]  audio cues really help
[31:05.520 --> 31:07.780]  when you're playing. The goal of the game
[31:07.780 --> 31:09.640]  is there's a group of victims that have to
[31:09.640 --> 31:11.620]  try to escape and you have a group of killers
[31:11.620 --> 31:13.260]  trying to kill you and prevent you from escaping.
[31:13.840 --> 31:15.000]  I was playing as a victim and I thought
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.780]  I should have some audio to this because it would make it
[31:17.780 --> 31:19.480]  easier. I'm trying to escape for an achievement.
[31:20.180 --> 31:21.860]  And I put my headset on. I play like
[31:21.860 --> 31:23.820]  three or four games and then in like
[31:23.820 --> 31:25.800]  the fifth game all of a sudden I hear a
[31:25.800 --> 31:27.640]  voice and I get freaked out because I forgot
[31:27.640 --> 31:29.580]  like oh shit I guess I'm technically
[31:29.580 --> 31:31.820]  in game chat. So I'm in this
[31:31.820 --> 31:33.900]  lobby and how it works is
[31:33.900 --> 31:35.740]  it sometimes takes like two or three minutes
[31:35.740 --> 31:37.300]  to find a lobby so it's a process.
[31:37.720 --> 31:39.660]  Then you get into the lobby. There are two
[31:39.660 --> 31:41.660]  requirements for the game to start. The first
[31:41.660 --> 31:43.680]  is that you need seven people. You need a full lobby.
[31:44.080 --> 31:45.740]  The second is that you can
[31:45.740 --> 31:48.060]  pick a variety of killer characters
[31:48.060 --> 31:49.620]  but at least one person
[31:49.620 --> 31:51.780]  needs to be playing as Leatherface or else it
[31:51.780 --> 31:53.920]  won't start. There's a timer in the top right
[31:53.920 --> 31:55.780]  that ticks down and if there
[31:55.780 --> 31:57.740]  isn't a Leatherface or the lobby isn't
[31:57.740 --> 31:59.760]  full it will kick you back to the
[31:59.760 --> 32:01.480]  main menu once it hits zero.
[32:02.060 --> 32:03.680]  So we're all in this lobby and
[32:03.680 --> 32:05.520]  I get spooked by this guy
[32:05.520 --> 32:07.760]  saying hey somebody switched to cook
[32:07.760 --> 32:09.680]  on the killer side. That's one of the killers
[32:09.680 --> 32:11.620]  you can play. He's currently Hitchhiker.
[32:12.000 --> 32:13.680]  The second person is a character named
[32:13.680 --> 32:15.760]  Sissy and the third is Leatherface.
[32:15.940 --> 32:17.900]  So he says hey somebody switched to cook
[32:17.900 --> 32:19.580]  and nobody does anything.
[32:20.220 --> 32:21.740]  And then like five seconds later
[32:21.740 --> 32:23.360]  he says no come on we need
[32:23.360 --> 32:25.580]  somebody go to cook and nobody
[32:25.580 --> 32:27.680]  does anything. And then he waits
[32:27.680 --> 32:29.500]  a little bit more and then he says okay seriously
[32:29.500 --> 32:31.720]  for this level we really
[32:31.720 --> 32:33.780]  should have a cook. And then the
[32:33.780 --> 32:35.560]  guy who's playing Leatherface switched
[32:35.560 --> 32:37.760]  to cook which now means the person
[32:37.760 --> 32:39.500]  who was playing Sissy would have to be Leatherface
[32:39.500 --> 32:41.600]  and they just quit. They just left
[32:41.600 --> 32:43.520]  because of it. And there's like
[32:43.520 --> 32:45.440]  90 seconds left in this lobby
[32:45.440 --> 32:47.560]  and I've listened to this whole thing and
[32:47.560 --> 32:49.120]  there's a part of me that
[32:49.820 --> 32:51.580]  it's just I think do I
[32:51.580 --> 32:53.280]  want to say something to this guy because I'm not
[32:53.280 --> 32:55.580]  I don't actually care but I feel like if I
[32:55.580 --> 32:57.660]  say something you'll probably get real heated and that
[32:57.660 --> 32:59.660]  could be funny. So I think about it for
[32:59.660 --> 33:01.560]  a minute and I say ah fuck it I'll
[33:01.560 --> 33:03.040]  do it. So I bring my headset down
[33:03.460 --> 33:05.600]  I said why'd you have to go
[33:05.600 --> 33:07.660]  and bully somebody to be cook now we're not gonna play
[33:07.660 --> 33:09.320]  and the guy immediately went
[33:09.320 --> 33:10.320]  mind your business
[33:10.320 --> 33:13.180]  he just kept saying mind your business and I said
[33:13.180 --> 33:15.340]  I am minding my business none of us are gonna get to
[33:15.340 --> 33:17.560]  play cause you had to bully somebody
[33:17.560 --> 33:19.280]  into being the cook and now we don't got a
[33:19.280 --> 33:21.240]  Leatherface. There's 60 seconds left
[33:21.240 --> 33:23.380]  he kept saying mind your business and I said I am
[33:23.380 --> 33:24.840]  what are you talking about you're being ridiculous
[33:25.240 --> 33:26.920]  and then he said just wait
[33:27.340 --> 33:28.880]  you try to escape this house
[33:28.880 --> 33:31.320]  I said nobody's escaping nothing we're not gonna
[33:31.320 --> 33:33.220]  get to the game we got two people we don't got a
[33:33.220 --> 33:34.960]  Leatherface we're not gonna go anywhere
[33:34.960 --> 33:37.140]  and he just kept saying good luck
[33:37.140 --> 33:39.080]  good luck in this game I'm gonna get you ain't even gonna
[33:39.080 --> 33:41.120]  leave the basement and I'm yelling back
[33:41.120 --> 33:43.000]  at him nobody's gonna get to the basement
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.240]  we're not getting into the house this game isn't
[33:45.240 --> 33:47.180]  happening cause you had to decide to be
[33:47.180 --> 33:49.260]  your fucking like Andy Reid try to call
[33:49.260 --> 33:51.200]  out the offense this is ridiculous
[33:51.200 --> 33:53.260]  what are you doing and he's
[33:53.260 --> 33:55.260]  just getting more mad at me and then because
[33:55.260 --> 33:57.360]  of my rally one of the other victims
[33:57.360 --> 33:59.180]  put their headset in and was like yeah
[33:59.180 --> 34:01.280]  you're a real idiot and then he's yelling at that
[34:01.280 --> 34:02.240]  guy and I'm like oh
[34:02.840 --> 34:05.180]  I'm getting him he's getting real mad
[34:05.180 --> 34:10.020]  And we're just going back and forth, the clock hits zero, everybody gets sent to the main
[34:10.020 --> 34:15.320]  menu and I open up my recently played with and I immediately message the guy, GG, and
[34:15.320 --> 34:17.260]  I'm laughing about it the entire time.
[34:17.920 --> 34:23.700]  I turn around and I look at my partner who witnessed all of this, and they just immediately
[34:23.700 --> 34:27.160]  said, I think I know why your rep was the way it was on the 360.
[34:33.720 --> 34:36.680]  I've been, ever since I apologize, a little antagonistic.
[34:36.820 --> 34:38.020]  I think it brought a fire out.
[34:38.360 --> 34:40.360]  But please proceed with your story.
[34:40.520 --> 34:41.040]  What happened?
[34:41.120 --> 34:43.840]  What was the fun thing that happened when you guys got together?
[34:44.140 --> 34:44.720]  Oh, this weekend?
[34:45.060 --> 34:45.700]  Yeah, this weekend.
[34:45.860 --> 34:46.600]  Tell me all about it.
[34:46.680 --> 34:49.640]  Well, now I don't want to tell you because I just feel like you're going to be antagonistic
[34:49.640 --> 34:50.680]  and aggressive and angry.
[34:51.060 --> 34:52.140]  No, I got out of my system.
[34:52.160 --> 34:52.980]  I don't know if it's cool enough.
[34:52.980 --> 34:59.900]  I don't know if it doesn't rise to the level of Andrew's ire threshold, but we all got
[34:59.900 --> 35:03.380]  together on Saturday and we watched the solar eclipse.
[35:04.140 --> 35:04.380]  That's all.
[35:04.520 --> 35:04.880]  That's pretty.
[35:05.320 --> 35:05.860]  That's, yeah.
[35:06.080 --> 35:07.780]  It was almost a total solar eclipse.
[35:07.900 --> 35:09.000]  We almost got a ring of fire.
[35:09.200 --> 35:11.180]  It was like, it was so close.
[35:11.340 --> 35:11.560]  It was.
[35:11.920 --> 35:12.740]  Yeah, that was pretty cool.
[35:12.960 --> 35:14.520]  I saw a lot of people posting about that.
[35:14.880 --> 35:15.000]  Yeah.
[35:15.300 --> 35:19.740]  The moon was like smaller than the sun, so it wasn't a proper total, but yeah, it was
[35:19.740 --> 35:20.480]  really cool to see.
[35:20.480 --> 35:24.500]  And it made all the shadows weird and just made being outside very weird.
[35:24.620 --> 35:25.140]  That's all.
[35:25.280 --> 35:26.160]  Please don't yell at me.
[35:26.420 --> 35:30.920]  I ate so much cheese on a cheese board.
[35:31.120 --> 35:32.780]  It was awesome.
[35:33.080 --> 35:36.520]  Yeah, we had like eclipse girl dinner lunch and it was amazing.
[35:37.740 --> 35:40.920]  We had, Andrew, we had eclipse girl dinner lunch.
[35:41.300 --> 35:41.680]  Yeah.
[35:41.900 --> 35:43.540]  Everybody knows what that is.
[35:44.280 --> 35:46.300]  I'm always having eclipse girl dinner lunch.
[35:46.640 --> 35:50.020]  Speaking of video games, did you guys see the big, the big news today?
[35:50.020 --> 35:50.580]  No.
[35:50.980 --> 35:51.840]  Oh, shit.
[35:51.900 --> 35:52.820]  The new trailer dropped.
[35:52.980 --> 35:53.620]  It is out.
[35:53.720 --> 35:55.160]  The trailer dropped and it is out.
[35:55.500 --> 36:00.140]  Season 11 of SnowRunner just hit Scandinavia, baby.
[36:00.420 --> 36:03.020]  There's going to be a new Burlak 6x6.
[36:03.060 --> 36:04.760]  It's an amphibious Russian vehicle.
[36:05.280 --> 36:09.940]  I'm going to tear up the countryside and I'm so fucking excited to play tonight.
[36:10.020 --> 36:10.860]  You don't even know.
[36:11.100 --> 36:12.340]  I mean, is Gavin going to play?
[36:12.500 --> 36:13.600]  You had Gavin play, right?
[36:13.980 --> 36:18.900]  Gavin played once and then he, the little bitch bitched out every other time since.
[36:18.900 --> 36:20.340]  We've played like every night since then.
[36:20.880 --> 36:23.360]  Is that why you had to go get coffee with him so he wouldn't call you names?
[36:23.540 --> 36:27.500]  He fucking literally told me the other night he had to do taxes.
[36:27.760 --> 36:29.040]  He was like, I have to do my taxes.
[36:29.520 --> 36:31.400]  Like that. That's the most like I have a headache.
[36:31.540 --> 36:33.060]  I have to wash my hair tonight.
[36:33.180 --> 36:34.400]  Fucking answer I've ever heard.
[36:34.480 --> 36:35.880]  It was tax day.
[36:36.060 --> 36:36.560]  Not in America.
[36:37.200 --> 36:38.340]  What? What? Yeah, it was.
[36:39.000 --> 36:39.800]  Tax day is in April.
[36:40.500 --> 36:42.340]  Yeah. If you if you have an extension.
[36:42.780 --> 36:46.780]  The other tax day is September 15th is when it was, I believe.
[36:46.940 --> 36:48.620]  October 16th. October 16th.
[36:48.620 --> 36:50.780]  Shit, did I miss a tax day?
[36:51.500 --> 36:53.060]  I'm not going to wash your hair.
[36:53.440 --> 36:54.700]  No, no, I paid mine in September.
[36:54.840 --> 36:57.060]  I paid mine when my accountant told me to pay it.
[36:57.240 --> 37:00.400]  But my biggest issue is actually that because Meg was in Japan,
[37:00.540 --> 37:01.560]  that's why she couldn't come to Key West.
[37:01.920 --> 37:03.740]  But and she came back and is very jet lagged.
[37:03.760 --> 37:07.280]  And because she's jet lagged, I am also jet lagged.
[37:08.900 --> 37:11.960]  You know, just being in a bed with someone who's not asleep.
[37:12.340 --> 37:13.600]  It means that you're awake, too.
[37:13.900 --> 37:15.460]  Yeah. So I'm I'm bed lagged.
[37:15.460 --> 37:19.100]  All kidding aside, we will be ripping up Scandinavia tonight.
[37:19.260 --> 37:20.760]  So if anybody wants. Are you doing tonight?
[37:21.020 --> 37:23.100]  Yeah. If anybody wants to play SnowRunner tonight, I'm free.
[37:23.220 --> 37:26.140]  So it's funny because that's funny that you say that now because I've been
[37:26.140 --> 37:28.860]  I was trying to organize that and you just didn't you ignored my text.
[37:28.980 --> 37:32.700]  So that's oh, I didn't ignore your text.
[37:32.780 --> 37:35.480]  I was editing a podcast and I didn't have time to respond.
[37:35.600 --> 37:38.240]  And then oh, the one man effort into this sounds like it sounds like
[37:38.240 --> 37:39.060]  you have a lot of podcasts.
[37:39.480 --> 37:42.820]  You were that's my that's my picture that is from the tutorial.
[37:42.820 --> 37:44.020]  Sort of stuff.
[37:44.620 --> 37:48.200]  You just completely undercut me, Gavin, you son of a bitch.
[37:48.520 --> 37:50.940]  Oh, sorry. I was about to say that.
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.980]  I saw speaking of me being happy that you guys were online.
[37:54.040 --> 37:56.560]  I saw you guys playing SnowRunners and it made me so happy.
[37:56.620 --> 37:57.660]  I was like, this is great.
[37:57.720 --> 37:59.300]  I'm so happy that just back in the games.
[37:59.460 --> 38:03.720]  I'm glad Gavin is into it because Geoff, I know, has been really excited
[38:03.720 --> 38:05.960]  and has wanted us to record a video in it.
[38:06.140 --> 38:09.980]  And Gavin was somebody who like I had done the tutorial like a year ago.
[38:10.020 --> 38:12.740]  I don't really remember any of it, but I've done it at least so I can play.
[38:12.820 --> 38:14.420]  But Gavin hadn't.
[38:14.520 --> 38:17.460]  And I thought, oh, I'm going to try to remind Gavin to get him onto it.
[38:17.540 --> 38:19.900]  And the next day you just happened to be doing it.
[38:20.340 --> 38:21.740]  And so I texted you about it.
[38:22.720 --> 38:26.000]  And then I saw you still in the game like three hours later.
[38:26.100 --> 38:28.520]  So I assume that you were either playing or you just left it on.
[38:28.960 --> 38:31.640]  And so I asked, so how did SnowRunners go?
[38:31.780 --> 38:34.800]  And that the image that Gavin sent was what he replied with
[38:34.800 --> 38:37.820]  for how his tutorial went, which I thought was very funny.
[38:38.360 --> 38:39.800]  I see. I could get him out of that. That's easy.
[38:40.140 --> 38:41.340]  You can get him out of that.
[38:41.340 --> 38:44.580]  Yeah, nothing's too stuck, is all I heard about this game.
[38:45.420 --> 38:47.140]  Almost nothing is too stuck.
[38:47.560 --> 38:48.480]  There have been a few instances.
[38:49.220 --> 38:50.420]  But Gavin, how was it?
[38:50.460 --> 38:51.060]  How did you feel?
[38:51.220 --> 38:55.460]  What was it like playing SnowRunners with Antonio and Bernie and I?
[38:55.560 --> 38:57.580]  I'll be honest, it was very high pressure.
[38:57.820 --> 39:02.700]  Like I was really worried I'd embarrass myself, but everyone was very welcoming
[39:02.700 --> 39:05.600]  and they, you know, giving me tips and like, oh, you know, winch to that tree
[39:05.600 --> 39:07.200]  and all this stuff.
[39:07.300 --> 39:10.580]  And at some point I almost completed one mission.
[39:11.160 --> 39:14.320]  That mission that you almost completed took us about another two hours
[39:14.320 --> 39:15.400]  the next night to complete.
[39:15.540 --> 39:16.820]  It was you had done a lot of work.
[39:17.980 --> 39:18.740]  It had a lot.
[39:18.800 --> 39:21.080]  It was a lot more about the environment of Siberia than it was you.
[39:21.340 --> 39:25.160]  It's so funny you said that, because the next night they were so nervous.
[39:25.280 --> 39:26.280]  They're like, I think we blew it with Gavin.
[39:26.400 --> 39:27.800]  I don't think I don't think he had fun.
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.100]  He's never going to play with us again.
[39:29.220 --> 39:32.320]  They were you guys were both so independently nervous of playing with each other.
[39:32.500 --> 39:34.300]  It's so much fun. Really fucking funny.
[39:34.340 --> 39:35.520]  And they had so much fun, too.
[39:35.580 --> 39:36.620]  They're like, hey, fit right in.
[39:36.700 --> 39:38.120]  It seemed like he was enjoying it.
[39:38.120 --> 39:42.280]  The only problem was we had really, really bad problems getting disconnected,
[39:42.480 --> 39:46.940]  which I had I forgotten to mention to Gavin that that sometimes can be a thing.
[39:47.080 --> 39:48.820]  The next night we had zero drops.
[39:48.980 --> 39:52.200]  But the last time we played and Bernie just couldn't stay in all night long.
[39:52.280 --> 39:54.140]  It's like sometimes it works perfectly.
[39:54.140 --> 39:56.180]  And sometimes you're beset with tech problems.
[39:56.280 --> 39:59.620]  Yeah, it's a bit of a temperamental turd, but it's really fun when you're in it.
[39:59.820 --> 40:03.160]  Yeah. Are you guys going to try to record a video tonight then or what?
[40:03.280 --> 40:05.460]  Oh, I'd like to. I texted about it. I'd love to.
[40:06.120 --> 40:08.180]  Oh, so this is your point here.
[40:08.280 --> 40:10.800]  OK, sweet. Wait, what?
[40:10.940 --> 40:12.780]  Hold on. What'd you say, Andrew?
[40:12.920 --> 40:17.020]  Remember when I texted you last night, Gavin, if you had plans the following day?
[40:17.400 --> 40:19.160]  Yeah. And I said I'm free after this.
[40:19.220 --> 40:20.560]  Yeah, that was I was trying to.
[40:20.660 --> 40:21.720]  Yeah. You didn't reply to me.
[40:21.980 --> 40:24.060]  No, because I was waiting on Geoff to reply.
[40:24.460 --> 40:26.200]  Oh, but you didn't text me till today.
[40:26.560 --> 40:28.820]  No, I texted you last night and then I replied.
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.420]  I texted you in the morning.
[40:30.580 --> 40:33.960]  Let me let you know about this feature called a group text.
[40:34.760 --> 40:36.660]  I, uh, I responded to you, Andrew.
[40:36.820 --> 40:38.800]  I said, well, you can check your phone. I responded.
[40:38.900 --> 40:40.440]  Yeah, I'll look. I'll look at it.
[40:40.660 --> 40:41.880]  Can you let us know what it says, Andrew?
[40:42.660 --> 40:44.040]  OK, give me a second. Let me.
[40:45.200 --> 40:47.660]  Let me open it. Let's do it.
[40:48.520 --> 40:51.320]  Sweet. Well, Eric, you're you want to be here, too, right?
[40:51.540 --> 40:53.020]  What's that? Didn't you want to watch?
[40:53.220 --> 40:55.360]  If there's a way to watch, I would love to watch.
[40:55.540 --> 40:57.760]  You'd have to somebody would have to broadcast their screen to you
[40:57.760 --> 40:59.020]  and you just have to watch Discord.
[40:59.480 --> 41:01.480]  I mean, if I can't, I can't do that.
[41:01.520 --> 41:02.940]  But one of them probably can. OK.
[41:02.940 --> 41:07.860]  Yeah, I think I'm really excited for the response to this episode
[41:07.860 --> 41:12.820]  because it is so out of step with the other 170 that we've done.
[41:12.920 --> 41:18.500]  This feels so terse and almost confrontational,
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.520]  but none of it is out of malice and I'm enjoying it so much.
[41:23.800 --> 41:27.040]  But I think people are going to hate it.
[41:27.140 --> 41:28.500]  Oh, is this a shit episode? No.
[41:28.900 --> 41:30.540]  No, no, no, no. That's the thing.
[41:30.540 --> 41:33.120]  I don't think it's a bad episode at all,
[41:33.240 --> 41:38.100]  but I think there are a lot of people who don't want you guys to argue ever.
[41:38.380 --> 41:41.200]  And this has been this starts with you.
[41:41.340 --> 41:43.880]  We're going to talk about I don't think Andrew some more.
[41:43.980 --> 41:45.900]  None of it has been malicious or mean.
[41:46.040 --> 41:50.020]  It has just been like bitey in such a fun way.
[41:50.380 --> 41:52.040]  I take exception to that, Eric.
[41:52.120 --> 41:55.320]  I think it has been toxic and mean.
[41:56.220 --> 41:57.460]  And I'm angry.
[41:57.460 --> 42:01.200]  I I genuinely love this podcast
[42:01.720 --> 42:06.280]  because the dynamic can be so rambunctious and weird.
[42:06.500 --> 42:08.040]  And then it can be this.
[42:08.140 --> 42:12.100]  And then we can turn on a dime and it's like none of this ever happened.
[42:12.920 --> 42:14.960]  It's the best.
[42:15.780 --> 42:17.080]  Hey, what do you think of that, Andrew?
[42:17.480 --> 42:18.360]  Oh, shit. Dong.
[42:18.380 --> 42:20.500]  It says image 0298.
[42:20.700 --> 42:21.600]  It's like you donged it.
[42:21.920 --> 42:23.660]  It was a dong again.
[42:25.080 --> 42:26.380]  Oh, that was going to be
[42:26.380 --> 42:28.580]  oh, shit.
[42:30.960 --> 42:33.560]  Gavin just dropped a seven meg dong.
[42:34.260 --> 42:35.940]  That was a big old dong.
[42:36.060 --> 42:37.800]  I don't know what that's a gold medal dong or anything.
[42:39.540 --> 42:40.900]  Damn, you're a big dong.
[42:41.540 --> 42:44.840]  Oh no, you double donged, you doubled it.
[42:45.760 --> 42:47.100]  It's a reverse harem.
[42:49.600 --> 42:51.240]  I mean, could I take a screenshot?
[42:51.460 --> 42:53.100]  Will it dong that way? Is this a dong?
[42:55.380 --> 42:57.640]  Oh, what do you think of that, Andrew?
[42:58.380 --> 43:01.040]  Oh, that's that's a nice coffee with you and Geoff.
[43:01.320 --> 43:02.980]  I didn't know you took a picture of me.
[43:03.280 --> 43:06.100]  Geoff's wearing a bright red jacket.
[43:06.480 --> 43:08.240]  This is his new jacket.
[43:08.600 --> 43:09.260]  And this is my new jacket.
[43:10.180 --> 43:12.640]  This is a this is a coffee shop we're supposed to do for Anmo,
[43:12.720 --> 43:13.460]  but we haven't done it yet.
[43:13.560 --> 43:14.940]  Yeah. First light. It's good.
[43:15.000 --> 43:16.100]  Oh, it's food. It looks.
[43:16.200 --> 43:17.320]  Is it like a library?
[43:17.720 --> 43:19.180]  Don't review it on this show.
[43:19.340 --> 43:21.660]  It's a bookstore that has a coffee shop in it.
[43:21.700 --> 43:22.400]  Oh, that's awesome.
[43:22.400 --> 43:23.960]  That's like a wonderful you.
[43:24.080 --> 43:25.460]  That's a great vibe for it.
[43:26.080 --> 43:27.600]  The coffee looks delicious.
[43:27.920 --> 43:30.240]  That's great. Got myself a little cap. Nice.
[43:30.500 --> 43:33.260]  Not allowed to give my review on the coffee here.
[43:33.380 --> 43:34.200]  I have to do that elsewhere.
[43:34.480 --> 43:37.780]  Thank you. But it's for one of your other podcasts.
[43:38.420 --> 43:39.280]  One of the seven.
[43:39.640 --> 43:40.600]  And any snacks with it?
[43:40.840 --> 43:41.380]  What do you say, Andrew?
[43:41.600 --> 43:43.740]  Any snacks? I'm curious if you had snacks with your coffee.
[43:43.920 --> 43:45.000]  No, I thought all their snacks.
[43:45.140 --> 43:46.580]  Well, I don't want to give I know.
[43:46.920 --> 43:48.740]  I guess I can't say I wasn't.
[43:49.280 --> 43:49.860]  Fuck it. I don't care.
[43:50.120 --> 43:50.780]  Eric can be mad at me.
[43:50.860 --> 43:52.180]  I thought their snacks were pretty shitty.
[43:52.180 --> 43:53.020]  I wasn't OK.
[43:53.320 --> 43:55.000]  Oh, no, that's too bad.
[43:56.200 --> 43:57.620]  Yeah. What are you going to do?
[43:57.700 --> 43:58.380]  They had lots of books.
[43:58.860 --> 43:59.740]  I love that.
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.560]  Can I ask for an update, Andrew, on your chair?
[44:02.840 --> 44:04.400]  It's still a stool. Still a stool.
[44:04.640 --> 44:06.320]  Yeah, I'm still just living the stool lifestyle.
[44:06.540 --> 44:08.820]  Yeah. What if we put out to all the companies
[44:08.820 --> 44:12.440]  that they can send you a chair?
[44:12.680 --> 44:16.680]  And if the chair lasts longer than a year, they get an ad read.
[44:16.940 --> 44:19.620]  I love it. Yeah, I think that's great.
[44:19.760 --> 44:21.580]  We should go with that Herman Miller chair.
[44:21.580 --> 44:23.940]  The really fancy like two thousand dollar one.
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.160]  We should get them to send the it's like supposed to be the best chair in the world.
[44:28.280 --> 44:29.880]  They're probably going to want an ad reading about what?
[44:30.440 --> 44:32.960]  Yeah, that I was thinking more from like Staples.
[44:33.180 --> 44:35.940]  But yeah, I like where you're like a DX racer or something.
[44:36.420 --> 44:38.000]  Staples is where I've been going.
[44:38.240 --> 44:39.740]  So I don't know. Staples is the.
[44:39.860 --> 44:41.160]  I think I just found the chair for Andrew.
[44:41.680 --> 44:43.340]  OK, here it is. I'll put it in there.
[44:43.540 --> 44:45.940]  Oh, oh, it's better than a seven Meg dong.
[44:46.020 --> 44:47.160]  Thanks. Yeah.
[44:47.360 --> 44:48.280]  Chair cockpit.
[44:48.480 --> 44:49.700]  I don't know if I have the room.
[44:49.700 --> 44:51.900]  It looks like a scorpion.
[44:52.220 --> 44:54.060]  It does. And it's got three monitors.
[44:54.440 --> 44:55.540]  Holy shit. Yeah.
[44:56.300 --> 44:58.640]  I just want you to have that for images later.
[44:58.820 --> 45:00.640]  God, that's so cool.
[45:01.440 --> 45:03.100]  Look at it from the back.
[45:03.860 --> 45:05.320]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[45:05.500 --> 45:08.020]  So I think I think we need to see if if
[45:09.180 --> 45:12.800]  gaming if the gate, if the gaming chair cockpit, ergonomic
[45:12.800 --> 45:16.900]  computer gaming cockpit adjustable hanging three screen monitor with LED light
[45:16.900 --> 45:20.140]  headrest, lumbar support, high back recliner, color style.
[45:20.440 --> 45:25.560]  One Boyati company wants to send Andrew a a chair.
[45:26.100 --> 45:27.480]  We can test it out for one year.
[45:27.620 --> 45:31.300]  If if it lasts, we'll give you a hell of a ad read.
[45:31.460 --> 45:35.200]  That's what that's one of those things that is very cool,
[45:35.260 --> 45:39.540]  probably while you're using it and very annoying when you're shimmying around it
[45:39.540 --> 45:41.060]  and it's taking up half of the room.
[45:41.280 --> 45:44.340]  I think it's one of those things that's very cool when you ask for it
[45:44.340 --> 45:49.700]  when you're 14 and until you're about 18 and you're a senior in high school
[45:49.700 --> 45:52.220]  and then your friend comes over and they're like, what the fuck is this?
[45:53.600 --> 45:56.640]  That chair is what it was like to work at Razer.
[46:00.600 --> 46:05.900]  I feel like it'd be like being in a Decepticon is the way I feel in that chair.
[46:06.260 --> 46:07.840]  Yes. Yeah. Yes.
[46:08.060 --> 46:09.540]  Like a Michael Bay Decepticon.
[46:09.960 --> 46:11.200]  Well, would you like a chair like that, Andrew?
[46:11.680 --> 46:13.280]  Or would that be a massive inconvenience?
[46:13.280 --> 46:14.940]  I don't think I have the space for that.
[46:15.040 --> 46:16.100]  I think it's a wonderful chair.
[46:16.540 --> 46:20.580]  I like the idea of this being like the equivalent of the sword
[46:20.580 --> 46:23.040]  in the stone, maybe, or like Cinderella's slipper.
[46:23.160 --> 46:26.080]  But for my ass, the chair, the right chair that'll fit.
[46:27.020 --> 46:28.660]  Anything that'll get me a new chair, I support.
[46:28.960 --> 46:31.760]  Because this is I'm getting I'll be honest.
[46:31.960 --> 46:36.520]  I deal with some tush fatigue, some ass fatigue in this setup.
[46:36.880 --> 46:39.140]  Where do you feel it? Like on just in the cheeks?
[46:39.400 --> 46:40.660]  Just the cheeks. Yeah.
[46:40.680 --> 46:42.740]  I'd say after about like an hour in the chair,
[46:42.740 --> 46:46.040]  I got to kind of get up and stretch out or lay down for a little bit
[46:46.040 --> 46:50.060]  because it really the cheek cheek problems are high in this setup.
[46:51.760 --> 46:54.320]  I think you should email a bunch of companies
[46:54.320 --> 46:56.640]  and propose what we've just proposed.
[46:56.980 --> 47:00.280]  I think the angle you could take to is like, listen, I have an incredibly
[47:00.280 --> 47:03.700]  long back and a very sturdy neck and head.
[47:03.840 --> 47:09.560]  And there hasn't been a chair invented that can withstand me.
[47:09.860 --> 47:11.200]  Are you up to the task?
[47:11.200 --> 47:13.400]  Yeah, it can't withstand you.
[47:13.700 --> 47:14.820]  Are you up to the task?
[47:14.920 --> 47:15.800]  Is your chair?
[47:16.180 --> 47:21.260]  How about you guys collaborate and come up with a template that I can send
[47:21.260 --> 47:23.620]  and I will send that to every chair company that I can find.
[47:24.020 --> 47:25.720]  What about that collaborative effort?
[47:26.000 --> 47:27.060]  OK, yeah.
[47:27.540 --> 47:29.660]  Do you have to send it whatever we give you to? Absolutely.
[47:29.840 --> 47:30.640]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[47:30.900 --> 47:32.020]  Who are you going to send it to, though?
[47:32.220 --> 47:34.360]  Every chair company I can find. I don't know.
[47:34.440 --> 47:36.540]  I don't know a lot of chair companies off the top of my head,
[47:36.580 --> 47:37.800]  so I can't list them to you.
[47:37.820 --> 47:39.800]  But I will I will do the due diligence.
[47:39.800 --> 47:41.100]  I will send it out.
[47:41.140 --> 47:43.540]  Yeah, but you can lay down in the scorpion chair.
[47:45.720 --> 47:50.920]  You can get rid of your bed and just sleep in the scorpion chair, Andrew.
[47:51.200 --> 47:52.120]  Oh, my God.
[47:52.620 --> 47:54.500]  You can take a scorpion nap.
[47:55.180 --> 47:56.200]  So big.
[47:59.020 --> 48:00.260]  It's either that.
[48:00.480 --> 48:02.540]  I'm just looking up cool gaming chairs.
[48:03.660 --> 48:07.940]  So to me, it's it's either that one or
[48:08.740 --> 48:11.820]  kind of what the situation is that you're already in,
[48:11.940 --> 48:13.780]  which is just a thing on the ground.
[48:18.020 --> 48:20.940]  You're kind of we got to find a middle here for you, bud.
[48:21.220 --> 48:21.980]  I'm going to be honest.
[48:22.620 --> 48:23.860]  Please cut you off again. I'm sorry.
[48:24.020 --> 48:24.560]  Yeah, I apologize.
[48:25.160 --> 48:28.120]  What's happening is I've I've been dealing with like a chest infection.
[48:28.340 --> 48:31.600]  So if I laugh really hard, I'm going to cough up so much phlegm.
[48:31.880 --> 48:33.740]  So I'm trying my best not to laugh.
[48:33.760 --> 48:37.200]  And I feel like that has really reduced my jovialness.
[48:38.480 --> 48:40.660]  Because you're not getting like endorphins from laughing.
[48:41.260 --> 48:42.100]  I think so. Yeah.
[48:42.140 --> 48:44.720]  And like I'm trying to hold it back, like I'm smiling.
[48:44.920 --> 48:47.380]  But I'm and I think like there are many times this episode
[48:47.380 --> 48:50.440]  where I typically be laughing really hard, but I'm having to hold it
[48:50.440 --> 48:53.500]  because I don't want you guys to have to hear me coughing up a bunch of phlegm.
[48:53.600 --> 48:56.840]  To be honest, I think we've instinctually kind of picked up on that.
[48:56.860 --> 48:59.740]  And we've been trying really hard not to be funny this episode.
[49:01.440 --> 49:04.360]  You know, I don't know what Andrew looks like smiling.
[49:04.360 --> 49:07.180]  Yeah. You also you also said that.
[49:07.300 --> 49:09.580]  And Andrew didn't laugh, but I bet he was smiling.
[49:10.020 --> 49:13.080]  I am. I'm smiling very wide right now.
[49:13.160 --> 49:14.140]  Do you have a good smile?
[49:14.480 --> 49:15.520]  No, I don't think so.
[49:15.800 --> 49:18.780]  Oh, do you have do you have a beard right now?
[49:19.200 --> 49:19.620]  Yeah, I have a beard.
[49:19.800 --> 49:21.820]  I don't like my smile just in general.
[49:22.320 --> 49:23.980]  Why not? Because I don't.
[49:24.060 --> 49:27.400]  A lot of people have and this is a lifelong problem for me.
[49:27.660 --> 49:30.660]  A lot of people have a great tooth smile, you know, with the mouth open.
[49:30.980 --> 49:33.880]  Oh, I just have never had the confidence or the ability
[49:33.880 --> 49:34.880]  to do that.
[49:35.600 --> 49:38.720]  So I'm a I'm a lips pushed together smile.
[49:39.040 --> 49:40.820]  I'm a no teeth closed mouth.
[49:41.020 --> 49:42.640]  I think I am too.
[49:42.940 --> 49:43.940]  Yeah, me too.
[49:44.120 --> 49:47.200]  But I mean, when you laugh, you can't you can't laugh with your mouth shut that much.
[49:47.380 --> 49:48.760]  I mean, it can be done, but it's not.
[49:48.900 --> 49:49.880]  Yeah, it's not easy.
[49:50.220 --> 49:52.440]  I have enough lips to cover my teeth, right?
[49:52.480 --> 49:53.140]  It's never an issue.
[49:53.500 --> 49:56.300]  I feel like you have an excuse, though, because you had to like your jaw
[49:56.300 --> 49:57.900]  had to be readjusted, right?
[49:58.140 --> 50:00.020]  Like that's well readjusted.
[50:00.020 --> 50:02.660]  That would be a that's a modest way of putting it.
[50:02.660 --> 50:05.900]  Had to be like taken apart and sliced into 30 pieces and then rebuilt
[50:05.900 --> 50:07.640]  like the fucking six million dollar man.
[50:07.880 --> 50:10.420]  But but at least you haven't had any dental work recently, right?
[50:10.660 --> 50:13.600]  No, I went to the dentist last week.
[50:13.820 --> 50:14.700]  Oh, are you serious?
[50:14.840 --> 50:16.840]  Yeah, I didn't tell you guys.
[50:17.100 --> 50:19.440]  Oh, oh.
[50:19.600 --> 50:21.640]  But you were only there for like 10 minutes, right?
[50:21.700 --> 50:22.780]  Three and a half hours.
[50:22.780 --> 50:23.580]  What happened?
[50:24.860 --> 50:26.280]  Oh, not three and a half, three hours.
[50:27.200 --> 50:28.080]  Um, great.
[50:28.480 --> 50:29.240]  What happened?
[50:29.780 --> 50:32.400]  I went to my my just my normal teeth cleaning.
[50:32.400 --> 50:36.880]  The week the leading up to when we went to Key West
[50:37.360 --> 50:40.440]  and the doctor was like the mouth doctor, dentist lady.
[50:40.600 --> 50:44.180]  She was like, your back tooth, back, lower right tooth is cracked.
[50:44.280 --> 50:45.140]  It's been cracked for a long time.
[50:45.200 --> 50:46.180]  I've been keeping an eye on it.
[50:46.360 --> 50:47.360]  It's cracked around the filling.
[50:47.600 --> 50:51.480]  And I think it's probably time to it's going to crack completely pretty soon.
[50:51.540 --> 50:53.420]  So we should probably just throw a throw a crown on there.
[50:53.420 --> 50:58.260]  And I was like, oh, and so part of why I had to get home
[50:58.260 --> 51:02.480]  when I did was because I had from Key West is because at eight a.m.
[51:02.860 --> 51:06.600]  the morning after Key West, I had to go to the dentist and get a crown.
[51:07.200 --> 51:08.860]  And so I had to go do that.
[51:08.980 --> 51:13.820]  And it for some reason, for some fucking reason, it took about three hours
[51:14.540 --> 51:16.120]  and it ruined my whole day.
[51:16.220 --> 51:18.940]  And I have to go back next week to get the permanent crown put in.
[51:19.060 --> 51:20.620]  Why are they crowning a crack?
[51:20.680 --> 51:21.480]  To just get rid of it?
[51:22.600 --> 51:24.120]  That's going to be so much hassle later.
[51:24.320 --> 51:26.680]  That is certainly an option for you.
[51:28.700 --> 51:32.560]  OK, I'm going to keep as much of the teeth as I can.
[51:35.940 --> 51:38.800]  Anyway, so, yeah, it wasn't particularly painful or anything,
[51:39.200 --> 51:43.320]  but it definitely took forever and I definitely got a mouthful of shots.
[51:43.500 --> 51:47.600]  I'm just so over even talking about it that I didn't even bring it up
[51:47.600 --> 51:48.680]  on the podcast last week.
[51:48.700 --> 51:50.840]  And I probably I wasn't ever going to bring it up.
[51:50.920 --> 51:54.380]  But yeah, yeah, I'm in the process of another dental thing right now.
[51:54.440 --> 51:57.140]  It's just I'm having trouble finding humor in it.
[51:57.140 --> 52:00.360]  So I'm not really excited to talk about it.
[52:00.400 --> 52:04.800]  I think what's funny to me is you talked about them taking your jaw,
[52:05.480 --> 52:09.400]  redesigning it six million dollar man style or another example
[52:09.400 --> 52:10.920]  that comes to mind is Robocop.
[52:11.160 --> 52:16.300]  Both those situations, they made a vast improvement on the base human form.
[52:16.780 --> 52:20.240]  For you, it was just like getting to normal to average like that.
[52:20.420 --> 52:24.720]  That's the worst part of that experience, which is, I'm sure, upsetting to you,
[52:24.720 --> 52:26.900]  but very funny that you have to go through that.
[52:27.460 --> 52:29.680]  Eric just wrote normal cop, which is perfect.
[52:30.340 --> 52:33.040]  I had to go through the Robocop treatment to become normal cop. Yeah.
[52:34.200 --> 52:39.840]  I just to get me up to like to get my face to a C to a solid C.
[52:40.040 --> 52:41.760]  I had to go do all that. Yeah.
[52:41.980 --> 52:45.300]  I don't think Robocop was in better condition after the surgery.
[52:45.640 --> 52:47.140]  He could take a bullet out a lot easier.
[52:47.520 --> 52:49.820]  Yeah, he can barely fit in his own car.
[52:49.980 --> 52:51.820]  I mean, he essentially became a superhero.
[52:51.820 --> 52:55.260]  Yeah, but his face was all pasted to a robot.
[52:55.580 --> 52:58.420]  Would you not say the Incredible Hulk is a superhero and an upgrade?
[52:59.220 --> 53:00.340]  It's the same thing.
[53:01.540 --> 53:04.320]  Yeah, but the Incredible Hulk gets to go back to being Bruce Banner
[53:04.320 --> 53:05.400]  whenever he calms down.
[53:05.560 --> 53:07.420]  Robocop doesn't get to go back to being cop.
[53:07.680 --> 53:09.420]  Yeah, he can't get his hand shot back on.
[53:09.680 --> 53:11.480]  Yeah. Yeah, he's just constantly robo.
[53:11.700 --> 53:15.380]  All he can do is like constantly drive by his ex-wife's house
[53:15.380 --> 53:16.640]  in the second movie and creep around.
[53:17.920 --> 53:20.660]  He constantly gets taken apart by bullies.
[53:20.660 --> 53:25.400]  Yeah, he does. He gets he gets fucking ripped apart by fucking street thugs.
[53:26.600 --> 53:28.760]  Are you guys going to play that Robocop game?
[53:28.820 --> 53:29.900]  Have you seen the Robocop game?
[53:30.100 --> 53:31.260]  No, I haven't. I haven't seen it.
[53:31.560 --> 53:32.860]  Robocop Rogue City.
[53:33.100 --> 53:34.380]  Have you you haven't heard about it? No.
[53:34.860 --> 53:40.800]  It's an FPS game where you're Robocop and you are blowing people away.
[53:41.160 --> 53:45.780]  You move slow like Robocop and you just like
[53:45.780 --> 53:50.380]  when you shoot people, red mist like they explode.
[53:51.220 --> 53:53.980]  You pick them up and throw them out the window. It's really cool.
[53:54.120 --> 53:56.900]  Could you target a bunch of dudes dicks and blow their dicks off?
[53:56.940 --> 53:59.900]  I think so. I think that is a thing you can do.
[54:00.100 --> 54:01.720]  There's a demo out right now.
[54:01.860 --> 54:04.600]  But like everything that I've seen about it is like, oh, wow.
[54:04.600 --> 54:08.840]  They made a Robocop game where like, you know how in like the boss
[54:08.840 --> 54:12.100]  is like a slow, you know, like Resident Evil three nemesis,
[54:12.200 --> 54:14.160]  like he moves slow and he's coming after you.
[54:14.160 --> 54:16.400]  That's you. You're Robocop.
[54:16.580 --> 54:18.420]  You move slow and you are relentless.
[54:18.700 --> 54:20.720]  It's it looks awesome.
[54:20.860 --> 54:24.180]  If we play that, we should do a dicks only playthrough.
[54:24.860 --> 54:27.900]  Yeah, yeah. I love that.
[54:28.060 --> 54:31.580]  Like if you kill somebody not through their dick, it's you have to restart.
[54:33.780 --> 54:35.620]  Dicks only speedrun.
[54:36.160 --> 54:39.100]  It's like the rules of engagement are dicks only.
[54:39.500 --> 54:41.780]  Anything else is like a fucking UN violation.
[54:42.980 --> 54:47.320]  Maybe we do like a submission of the best dick shots in games.
[54:47.380 --> 54:49.420]  Wow. There's some great dick shots in games.
[54:49.680 --> 54:50.020]  Like Stranglehold.
[54:50.960 --> 54:53.160]  We just started doing dick percent runs.
[54:53.580 --> 54:56.340]  Yeah. What's the dick kill in Stranglehold?
[54:56.620 --> 54:59.460]  You could go into like bullet time and make it slow motion
[54:59.460 --> 55:02.320]  and you could steer the bullet into their dick
[55:02.320 --> 55:04.780]  and then they'd grab their crotch and be like, oh,
[55:05.140 --> 55:06.920]  and they'd fall over holding their dick.
[55:07.280 --> 55:11.600]  Was it Sniper Elite 3 where you shoot Hitler in the ball?
[55:11.600 --> 55:14.120]  Yeah, shoot their balls off and make them explode.
[55:16.380 --> 55:20.800]  Or like through someone's eye out of the back of the head into someone's balls.
[55:26.100 --> 55:29.220]  Take out their eyeballs and then take out the other guy's regular balls.
[55:32.100 --> 55:33.240]  This is a great idea.
[55:33.560 --> 55:34.780]  Two balls, one kill.
[55:35.420 --> 55:38.240]  I was listening to a bunch of your partner's
[55:38.240 --> 55:41.000]  smart podcast and I was kind of blown away.
[55:41.600 --> 55:45.080]  How few euphemisms there were during the smut.
[55:45.360 --> 55:48.620]  Like I was expecting it to be like a little bit George R.R.
[55:48.720 --> 55:52.580]  Martin style, but it was like, man, I took my thick dick
[55:52.580 --> 55:54.600]  and rammed it home through her pussy.
[55:54.720 --> 55:57.740]  And it's like, Jesus. Yeah, it's just saying shit.
[55:58.200 --> 56:01.740]  Yeah. You want to come now from your vagina, don't you?
[56:01.980 --> 56:04.480]  What the fuck? Yeah, it it really is.
[56:04.480 --> 56:06.760]  Like they describe it like they describe dicks.
[56:06.820 --> 56:08.740]  They go decorated with veins.
[56:08.740 --> 56:12.160]  Yeah, that's the grossest thing I've ever heard.
[56:12.420 --> 56:15.520]  It's also every dick is the biggest dick ever made.
[56:15.760 --> 56:20.220]  It's like it's like the dick was the size of a small Scandinavian town.
[56:20.720 --> 56:21.980]  It's like it's fucked.
[56:22.060 --> 56:24.200]  And by the way, written for women by women.
[56:24.320 --> 56:27.960]  Oh, yeah. And I agree.
[56:28.220 --> 56:31.140]  I question my role here more and more.
[56:33.280 --> 56:36.840]  Listen, I'm talking about my wife's podcast.
[56:36.840 --> 56:38.720]  I'm talking about my fiance's podcast.
[56:38.900 --> 56:40.740]  There's nothing we can do about this.
[56:40.880 --> 56:44.720]  The thing that I found troubling with the dick is you brought up, Eric,
[56:44.820 --> 56:47.480]  there's a line in the book about decorated with veins.
[56:47.720 --> 56:52.560]  The way the way it was phrased, it was like a dick was like the 360 face
[56:52.560 --> 56:57.300]  plate that you could pop off the side and like put a new, more veiny option.
[56:58.140 --> 56:59.200]  Gross. Ridiculous.
[56:59.860 --> 57:01.540]  Gross. Yeah. But what do we know?
[57:01.580 --> 57:03.760]  We're just a bunch of dudes with veiny dicks.
[57:03.960 --> 57:05.040]  Yeah, I don't listen.
[57:05.040 --> 57:06.440]  I don't read books.
[57:06.520 --> 57:09.280]  It made me insecure about my veininess.
[57:09.340 --> 57:10.940]  I've never thought about.
[57:11.260 --> 57:12.140]  Are you light on veins?
[57:12.260 --> 57:13.120]  You feel under decorated?
[57:13.360 --> 57:15.080]  I feel very under decorated.
[57:15.300 --> 57:17.020]  Is it like smiling with your mouth closed?
[57:18.720 --> 57:23.120]  Now, imagine if your partner went on a podcast and talked about it,
[57:23.120 --> 57:26.980]  but not you specifically, just decorated this other one is.
[57:27.200 --> 57:28.180]  Yeah, boy.
[57:28.540 --> 57:30.840]  She was telling me about ones that they want to read.
[57:30.840 --> 57:33.240]  And she's like, I think we're going to do like a Thanksgiving thing.
[57:33.240 --> 57:34.540]  And I'm like, I don't even know.
[57:34.680 --> 57:37.180]  Like, why would there be book porn about Thanksgiving?
[57:38.620 --> 57:39.040]  Thanksgiving? Thanksgiving?
[57:39.580 --> 57:41.540]  So many stuffed euphemisms.
[57:42.200 --> 57:43.720]  They just did. They just recorded.
[57:43.820 --> 57:44.660]  You weren't here for it, Eric.
[57:44.740 --> 57:47.080]  But on Monday, they recorded their Halloween episode.
[57:47.380 --> 57:49.540]  And it was a book called Evil Boys.
[57:52.320 --> 57:56.340]  And spoiler, the evil boys have big veiny dicks.
[57:56.540 --> 58:01.820]  No. Oh, anyway, clutch my pearls podcast.
[58:01.820 --> 58:04.280]  Yeah, it's such a good name for a podcast.
[58:04.620 --> 58:08.380]  Listening to it made me realize that this is like kung fu movies for women.
[58:08.700 --> 58:10.960]  It is like what a great way to put it.
[58:11.140 --> 58:14.180]  It's like it's so it's it's their thing.
[58:14.240 --> 58:16.420]  And I love that they're into it. It's not at all my thing.
[58:16.480 --> 58:19.280]  It doesn't necessarily fully make sense to me, the appeal of it.
[58:19.320 --> 58:21.060]  But hey, like the fucking enjoy it.
[58:21.060 --> 58:25.440]  It's just dumb, specific content for for a very specific group.
[58:25.520 --> 58:27.980]  What's the equivalent with vaginas, though?
[58:28.360 --> 58:31.400]  Like, I feel like there's not a lot of descriptors or it's
[58:31.400 --> 58:32.640]  because dudes don't write books.
[58:32.920 --> 58:35.520]  Yeah, I mean, like dudes don't write sex books.
[58:35.700 --> 58:39.820]  I should I just want to say that this group here shouldn't start
[58:39.820 --> 58:42.780]  making guesses at what the descriptors should be.
[58:42.920 --> 58:43.860]  No, no interest. Yes.
[58:43.900 --> 58:45.440]  We'll leave it to the professionals.
[58:45.740 --> 58:47.940]  What if we all try and write a smut paragraph?
[58:48.360 --> 58:50.100]  I'm out. No, I don't want anything.
[58:50.180 --> 58:52.500]  I'll put the tiger balm back on my balls.
[58:52.620 --> 58:53.700]  I don't want anything to do with this one.
[58:53.980 --> 58:58.100]  What if we write like the male equivalent of what a smut thing would be?
[58:58.140 --> 59:00.480]  So it would be like 50 Shades of Manning.
[59:00.480 --> 59:03.400]  And it's just all about touchdown passes like it's not.
[59:06.280 --> 59:07.800]  Oh, this is really something.
[59:08.000 --> 59:09.880]  I can't believe you wouldn't read my smut.
[59:12.040 --> 59:13.300]  I'll read your smut, Gavin.
[59:13.380 --> 59:15.040]  I would gladly read your smut, Gavin.
[59:15.300 --> 59:18.440]  If you write it, I'll see if they'll read it on their podcast.
[59:18.860 --> 59:19.320]  There you go.
[59:19.680 --> 59:23.800]  Yeah, let's see if we can get them to let us to read a smut we write together.
[59:23.980 --> 59:26.280]  I don't want to write it. You write it.
[59:26.560 --> 59:28.600]  Gavin and I'll write it. Gavin and I'll write it together.
[59:28.760 --> 59:29.900]  Gavin, you want to collaborate with me?
[59:29.900 --> 59:31.240]  Yeah, you want to go get coffee?
[59:31.800 --> 59:33.700]  You want to go get a coffee? Let's go have a smut coffee.
[59:33.980 --> 59:34.860]  Let's go get a coffee club.
[59:35.160 --> 59:36.720]  That's the coffee I want to hear about.
[59:39.060 --> 59:42.220]  I got to say, it's been really kind of fucking up.
[59:42.440 --> 59:44.980]  You know, they've been working on this for about three months in the background,
[59:45.500 --> 59:49.020]  and it's been really kind of humbling to watch three people
[59:49.020 --> 59:53.100]  who have never worked in the entertainment industry ever
[59:53.860 --> 59:57.360]  sit down and figure out how to do what I do for a living.
[59:57.900 --> 01:00:01.900]  Start to finish in their spare time and figure it out
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.040]  and then launch a product and go, why is this so hard for you?
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.420]  And yeah, I got to be honest.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.100]  I don't know, because you just made it look really fucking easy.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:14.840]  And apparently I'm not I'm not nearly as good at this career as I thought I was.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.780]  My wife has never edited audio or video,
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:21.440]  so she learned Premiere and how to edit in Audacity.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.400]  Dude, fucking crazy.
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:27.340]  Your wife is a better editor a month in than I am.
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:30.180]  After 21 years, I feel the exact same way.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.540]  Oh, no laughing.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.460]  And Emily is a better like is a better Howard Stern,
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:39.480]  a better like straight man who leads people through a podcast.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.820]  And which by all but also I say straight man, it's like,
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:45.340]  but also being very funny in the same way than I than I am.
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.140]  And I've been trying to be that person.
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:48.880]  She's just naturally that person.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.740]  And it's like some of us have to work really fucking hard
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:55.180]  and do it like ten thousand, ten thousand hours.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.500]  And you just pick it up and you're like,
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.740]  oh, I'll just do what you do better.
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.900]  Oh, it's Monday night. I'll just do this real quick.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:00.960]  Oh, OK, cool. Thanks.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.900]  All right. We should wrap up now.
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:05.940]  I'm going to go learn how to cut hair.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.180]  Oh, that's oh, that's such a good idea.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:10.420]  Oh, you want to cut my hair?
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.480]  Oh, my God. Can we do that?
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.260]  Can we film that?
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.480]  I'm I'm certainly down for it.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.940]  You make me look like a fool.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.980]  Gavin, what if he promises to really try?
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.200]  I'll try super hard.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.960]  And if I get it wrong, I'll apologize real sincerely.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.260]  Not in baby voice. A genuine.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.840]  That's the only that's the only way I know how to apologize.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.920]  That's a double punishment then for Gavin.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.260]  What are you going to do?
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.480]  It's like people are always like, I demand an apology.
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.900]  You go, OK. Oh, no.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:49.660]  Oh, before we before we wrap up, I know Eric wants us to wrap up.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.820]  Did you guys see this bullshit?
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.360]  There's a new fucking apple on the market.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.380]  Why is it like a tomato?
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.360]  It looks like an apple, orange tomato hybrid.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:03.540]  It's called and I I distrust it because of how they describe it.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.360]  It's a kissabelle apple, right?
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:06.900]  And they say the kiss of nature.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.280]  It's the perfect partner that links taste and well-being
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.280]  to offer a vitalizing and natural antidote for the contemporary life.
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.840]  I just want an apple.
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.940]  I don't think I like that apple.
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.040]  That looks, uh, it looks disturbing.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.480]  It's disturbing. I don't know why.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:27.420]  In some of the images, I don't like the way it's described at all.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:28.660]  It bugs the shit out of me.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.100]  I don't want to vitalize or have a natural antidote for the contemporary life.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.040]  I'm pretty happy with my contemporary life.
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.280]  I don't need an antidote for it.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.520]  It says if you look at the sticker on the apple, it says kissabelle.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.140]  I'm right inside. Yeah, me too.
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:46.760]  When you cut it open, it kind of looks like it has leprosy is my issue.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.440]  It's like a leper apple.
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:50.120]  And I don't want to bite into that.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.860]  I don't think I ever looked at leprosy.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.700]  I'm just thinking about like Kingdom of Heaven.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.100]  There's the scene with the Edward Norton.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.800]  He's like a king or whatever, and he has it.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.700]  Oh, God. So should we try this apple?
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.400]  Nah, fuck him.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:04.980]  Yeah, there you go, baby.
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:09.680]  Would you go for a kissabelle orange or a kissabelle rouge?
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:14.760]  I mean, I think the rouge looks better, although the rouge kind of looks
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.000]  like a butthole. You know what I mean?
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:18.680]  Yeah, they're a bit anusy.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.500]  The top one with the where you can see the seeds isn't as bad,
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.720]  but the bottom one, it just looks like a fucking asshole.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:24.920]  It's pretty sphincter.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:28.140]  I think the top one looks like if a watermelon had an anus.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:30.020]  Yeah. Interesting.
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.340]  A watermelon's anus. Yeah.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.980]  Anyway, this podcast is a Cosmic Chris podcast.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.860]  So yeah, yeah, yeah. We're loyal.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.760]  Yeah. I'll still try this apple, though.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.520]  I bet it's. No, I will definitely try it, but I'm not.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.960]  I'm it's not going to compare.
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:45.280]  Yeah, I don't want I don't know that I don't want to.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:46.700]  I don't want to find out I like it better.
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.620]  I'm really happy liking the Cosmic Chris.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.820]  Well, you can head on over to facepod.com and you can watch face off
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.260]  if you want to check that out.
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.340]  Yeah, we got a million things for you to do now.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.240]  You can you can listen to this podcast.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.840]  You can go over. You can watch our supplemental.
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.820]  We we typically drop a supplemental episode just about every week.
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:08.180]  We got gaming to gaming videos a week.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.260]  We got the break show.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.580]  People have been very kind about our let's play videos.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:18.060]  A lot of people saying it's gone from the summer of 98 to the winter of 2012.
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:21.620]  And that's a compliment.
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.740]  They're saying that I saw that someone was
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.920]  confused about why Andrew only got to play once in the face off.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:32.220]  And someone suggested that he should have.
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:35.180]  He should have played Becca for his second round,
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.140]  which makes no sense, but also makes total sense in our universe.
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.520]  And by the way, without spoiling anything,
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:46.140]  but Andrew came up with a mechanic for a new for the next season.
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:49.640]  Oh, yeah, that makes the the latter make more sense.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.860]  It balances the teams better.
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:54.720]  But I think the way we did it makes total sense when you look at it and evaluate it.
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:58.120]  But this I think the new idea that Andrew came up with is going to make it
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:01.400]  and it actually makes me more excited about season two because we get to do it.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.560]  But you got to watch season one first, otherwise you're lost.
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.160]  That's true. Big match up this week, right?
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.900]  You you and I, Geoff, for one people, it'll be over, I guess.
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:11.560]  Oh, it'll absolutely be over.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.900]  Yeah, no, but yeah, you can talk about how it was.
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.220]  Yeah. Oh, it was real exciting.
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:19.440]  I had hope. I had a brief moment.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.580]  All I did that entire series was lose.
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:24.140]  I lost the randomizer. I lost our game.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.180]  First one eliminated on a raft by myself for a bit.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.600]  Can I oh, can I share quickly before we wrap up?
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:36.800]  I really I face myself massively the other day.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:40.280]  Just yesterday I did this because we're doing the video game content
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.460]  and all that stuff.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:45.620]  And I've been having so much fun trying to come up with format ideas
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:48.280]  to just spend more time with you guys, because I love you guys.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.560]  You're some of my favorite people.
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:52.460]  I just any excuse I can have to spend more time.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.280]  That's clearly evidenced by the first half of this podcast.
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:56.900]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.140]  Let him be nice. Let him be sincere. He was smiling.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:02.140]  I had a big cough. OK, and I cleared some stuff out.
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:03.520]  I'm good. I'm back to myself.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.400]  The evil is out of my body.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:08.640]  OK, I'm back to my normal jovial being.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.000]  But I love you guys so much.
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:11.940]  And I love you, Geoff.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.620]  And I've been looking at we've been exploring.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.760]  I have a place in my heart for really dumb licensed video games.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:22.860]  I just think they're especially when they bring in like the normal cast of the thing.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:26.640]  So broken and like the best way.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.960]  And I think it's so funny.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:32.160]  And so I've been exploring those and I learned that there's a Dallas game.
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:37.020]  And I got really excited about playing the Dallas game with you.
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.580]  And it came out on the NES.
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:43.200]  And so I bought I bought like an expensive machine
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.060]  that you can play NES games in HD on.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.820]  And I was so fucking excited.
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:50.440]  I'm like, yeah, this is perfect.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.220]  We can play the Dallas game.
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:55.360]  It's called the Dallas Quest, as Eric just posted a photo of it for.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.360]  So then I bought the machine.
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:58.660]  It shipped out and everything.
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:01.780]  And I decided, well, now I need to buy the Dallas Quest.
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.500]  And so I'm looking online.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.960]  It it didn't come out for the NES.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:08.280]  I just invented that in my head.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:12.200]  It is like it's like a Commodore 64 game.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.500]  It's got an Atari logo on the image.
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.960]  Yeah, there's an Atari and like Commodore.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.580]  And it's not it never released on the NES.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.300]  I just for some reason in my head it had.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:26.100]  And I bought this entire console for this specific purpose.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.580]  So now I'll figure out something else to do with this console.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:34.540]  But I really that's how badly I wanted to share in the Dallas experience
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:35.120]  with you, Geoff.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.700]  Maybe there's like a Knot's Landing or a Dynasty
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.140]  or Falcon Crest game we could play on your expensive emulator.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.460]  It's not even an emulator.
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:45.860]  It's why it's so expensive.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:46.700]  It like runs.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:51.340]  You need the cartridge and it like runs the thing as it is intended.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.140]  But in HD, can we still play the Dallas Quest somehow?
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.380]  I would love to.
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.800]  If someone can figure out a way to do that.
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:00.280]  So we need to emulate Commodore 64.
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.620]  Either that or Atari, probably.
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:04.260]  I'll see what we can find out.
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:04.900]  I'll poke around.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:05.840]  It looks great.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.500]  Look at the bugle and the rifle.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:10.060]  It looks just like Sue Ellen in that image, too.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:14.720]  The what I've heard in my research of the game is that it's a really good game,
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:18.580]  but it has almost nothing to do with Dallas, unfortunately.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.120]  Well, you start out.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.420]  Is it the South Fork Ranch?
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.900]  Is that what it's called? Yeah. Yeah.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.660]  So you start there and then almost immediately travel to South America
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:29.340]  and like everything that's Dallas related gets removed.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.760]  Well, now I will say in season three, they'd spend some time in South America.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:36.020]  That's where Jock's helicopter goes down and he disappears.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.560]  So there there is a tie.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.900]  I was lukewarm, but now there's a rat.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.780]  You see, small shovel, giant rat.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:44.720]  That's a Dallas rat.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.280]  I like that where it says, like, what do you want to do?
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.160]  It just says, well,
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:50.500]  well,
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.780]  I have to play this game before I die.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:00.800]  Yeah, by the way, we're going to do it.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:04.100]  Can I just say I'm up to season seven on Dallas now,
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:09.700]  if you guys want a current state of Dallas season seven's real dog shit.
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.080]  It's how many seasons are there?
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:13.300]  I think there's 12.
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.940]  Oh, season seven.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.500]  We're like 83 or 84.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.580]  It just it flips hard.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:24.080]  It's six really, really good seasons and then a big steaming pile of shit
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:28.760]  that season seven so far like it's gone real fucking ridiculous,
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.900]  real fast, just real fast.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:31.900]  It's bad.
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:33.140]  All right, now we wrap up.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.580]  I don't know how much longer. Yeah.
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.860]  I mean, I'm going to watch the other seven, the other five seasons or whatever.
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:39.340]  But man, I may not enjoy them.
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:42.240]  Anyway, we should probably stop because I'll just talk about Dallas forever.
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.100]  Yeah, I know.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:48.900]  Oh, man. Fucking Ray Krebs is on trial for a murder.
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:52.200]  It's not because he pulled the cord on Mickey.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.180]  Facepod dot com slash first.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:56.720]  If you want to support the show directly, we got all the stuff there.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.240]  But hey, if you're just listening to the show, that's plenty of support, too.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:01.680]  Thank you, Bobby and Pamela.
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.060]  I got divorced. Miss Ellie's off camera.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.400]  Sorry that you have to listen to this part of it.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.940]  I apologize for this part.
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:09.780]  You've heard your options lost.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.840]  God damn well, it's Mickey's day.
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:17.780]  Well, I turn off the podcast.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:20.380]  Bye.
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:21.560]  Hey, guys.
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:25.380]  Major League fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of Face.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.940]  Remember the Sonic guys?
