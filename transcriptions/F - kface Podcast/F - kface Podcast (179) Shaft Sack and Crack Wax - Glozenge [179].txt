[00:10.530 --> 00:13.490]  Nick looks like he doesn't know how his body works.
[00:13.530 --> 00:15.130]  Like he just got put into that body.
[00:15.570 --> 00:16.230]  Yeah, that's Nick.
[00:16.410 --> 00:17.130]  I thought, you know what?
[00:17.190 --> 00:18.970]  I'm seeing too much of Nick's feet.
[00:19.490 --> 00:22.310]  That's I sent that to Tony and Tony kind of said the same thing.
[00:22.690 --> 00:24.710]  I don't like the regulation feet.
[00:24.930 --> 00:26.030]  No, but I don't need to see them.
[00:26.170 --> 00:28.190]  No, we I just really like that shirt.
[00:28.290 --> 00:29.810]  I'm such a big fan of that shirt.
[00:30.230 --> 00:31.610]  Like they look like dog feet.
[00:32.490 --> 00:34.010]  Why do you look kind of like dog?
[00:34.090 --> 00:35.050]  No, I know what you're saying.
[00:35.550 --> 00:36.250]  I know what you're saying.
[00:36.350 --> 00:37.590]  They're like pale dog feet.
[00:37.590 --> 00:38.810]  Yeah. What?
[00:39.570 --> 00:41.250]  I think it's just maybe the angle.
[00:41.290 --> 00:42.250]  Well, they're front on.
[00:42.370 --> 00:43.130]  It's a normal angle.
[00:43.470 --> 00:44.290]  You're right, though, Gav.
[00:44.370 --> 00:45.630]  They're kind of like dog feet.
[00:45.690 --> 00:46.590]  They're kind of like arrows feet.
[00:47.010 --> 00:51.330]  Yeah, it's almost like there's too much foot between the heel and the toes.
[00:52.010 --> 00:52.690]  Yeah. Yeah.
[00:52.830 --> 00:54.070]  Too much foot between the heel and the toes.
[00:54.230 --> 00:56.050]  You think his feet are...
[00:56.050 --> 00:57.710]  You think it's too long?
[00:57.850 --> 01:00.170]  Like he has long, like he has long feet?
[01:00.550 --> 01:02.030]  I don't know. The shoes are doing no favors.
[01:02.670 --> 01:04.650]  It's yeah, I think it's the shoes.
[01:04.750 --> 01:05.690]  I think it's the straps.
[01:06.630 --> 01:08.710]  Yeah, I mean, it's a it's a crazy.
[01:08.810 --> 01:11.090]  I think that's a crazy shoe to wear to Disney.
[01:11.450 --> 01:12.350]  You know what I mean?
[01:12.590 --> 01:13.570]  Well, there's kids around.
[01:14.590 --> 01:16.370]  Yeah. Oh, hang on.
[01:16.610 --> 01:19.270]  Hang on. What does there's kids around mean?
[01:20.090 --> 01:21.250]  Oh, you know, it's a lot of foot.
[01:21.410 --> 01:22.510]  Could have shield their eyes from.
[01:23.190 --> 01:25.010]  That's what you think I'm talking about?
[01:25.210 --> 01:27.990]  I don't want my kids seeing no stranger's feet.
[01:28.290 --> 01:30.050]  I just meant that it's a lot of walking.
[01:30.910 --> 01:31.770]  You know what it kind of looks like?
[01:31.790 --> 01:34.850]  It looks like he's wearing shoes that prepare your feet
[01:34.850 --> 01:36.210]  to go in the clown shoes.
[01:36.210 --> 01:38.290]  We are stretching his foot out.
[01:38.550 --> 01:39.790]  Bindings for clown shoes.
[01:39.910 --> 01:41.010]  Yeah, it's getting pulling.
[01:41.470 --> 01:44.790]  He's getting roasted so fucking hard and he's on vacation.
[01:45.570 --> 01:46.670]  No, no, no, not at all.
[01:46.730 --> 01:48.010]  It's like a reverse binding.
[01:48.530 --> 01:50.390]  It's like it's like it would be like fixing binding,
[01:50.570 --> 01:51.810]  like stretching the feet back out.
[01:51.990 --> 01:53.470]  This is like traction.
[01:54.090 --> 01:54.930]  This is yeah.
[01:55.130 --> 01:56.830]  OK, this episode 179.
[01:56.910 --> 01:58.410]  Can we not talk about Nick's feet?
[01:58.450 --> 02:00.170]  He's wearing his traction sandies.
[02:00.470 --> 02:01.730]  I know it's Gavin's favorite subject.
[02:01.830 --> 02:03.470]  Can we not talk about these feet anymore, please?
[02:03.470 --> 02:04.570]  You know, you know what?
[02:04.670 --> 02:07.470]  You know, the hello and welcome to another episode of F*** Face.
[02:07.550 --> 02:08.870]  Geoff Ramsey, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey.
[02:09.190 --> 02:12.890]  You know what's the problem with fucking shoes like these, right?
[02:13.090 --> 02:15.390]  Especially in public in a place like Disneyland.
[02:15.890 --> 02:17.250]  That there's hardly any shoe on it.
[02:17.510 --> 02:20.450]  Well, yeah, that there's hardly any shoe, that there's mostly skin.
[02:20.650 --> 02:21.910]  And you know what's on the ground?
[02:22.750 --> 02:25.990]  Piss, vomit, poop, oil,
[02:26.850 --> 02:30.570]  dirty rain, food, trash, maggots,
[02:30.810 --> 02:33.210]  everything in the world that you don't want to touch
[02:33.210 --> 02:34.530]  with your skin is on the ground.
[02:34.670 --> 02:38.010]  I'll never understand why people want to put their skin on the dirty,
[02:38.110 --> 02:39.030]  dirt, dirt ground.
[02:39.150 --> 02:41.530]  At Disney World? Or are you just talking like in general?
[02:42.130 --> 02:43.950]  In general, but also at Disney World.
[02:43.990 --> 02:46.590]  Yeah, Disney World's known for its maggots and dirty rain.
[02:47.190 --> 02:49.010]  Yeah, maggots and dirty rain everywhere.
[02:50.150 --> 02:54.490]  I think my biggest issue with Nick's shoes is they originally started as Jordans.
[02:54.570 --> 02:55.510]  And that's all that's left.
[02:58.650 --> 03:01.810]  For people that can't see them, it's two straps.
[03:01.810 --> 03:04.630]  It looks like two pieces of plastic over.
[03:04.990 --> 03:09.950]  So I need to immediately apologize because I've been dicking everyone around all day.
[03:10.110 --> 03:11.770]  And I assume there were no pleasantries today.
[03:12.210 --> 03:13.270]  No, there were none.
[03:13.990 --> 03:18.790]  No, I think the pleasantries that we had were you guys just slamming Nick
[03:18.790 --> 03:21.190]  for two solid minutes.
[03:21.690 --> 03:26.110]  No, the pleasantries were I said to Eric, shouldn't there be more people here?
[03:26.210 --> 03:28.550]  And he said, I agree. And then we started.
[03:29.350 --> 03:31.150]  Huh. They're pretty short pleasantries.
[03:31.450 --> 03:32.410]  Yeah, they were.
[03:33.150 --> 03:34.870]  I'd say no pleasantries at all.
[03:34.930 --> 03:37.870]  I'd like to take over the show for a minute and just
[03:39.010 --> 03:40.110]  by all means.
[03:40.670 --> 03:43.850]  Yeah, I'm taking it over just for a moment before we get too deep
[03:43.850 --> 03:46.450]  to apologize for last episode.
[03:46.690 --> 03:49.370]  I don't I don't know what happened last episode.
[03:49.690 --> 03:51.010]  The one where you were all fired.
[03:51.290 --> 03:53.090]  You got you in a lobby.
[03:53.210 --> 03:54.010]  You got lobbied.
[03:54.450 --> 03:56.610]  Well, I know in a public lobby about it.
[03:56.610 --> 03:59.050]  I was on. There was a lot of sass.
[03:59.310 --> 04:00.030]  I don't. Yeah.
[04:00.690 --> 04:02.590]  You thought our coffee was dog shit.
[04:03.190 --> 04:04.530]  Yeah. It was a great episode.
[04:04.690 --> 04:05.590]  You had a tree trunk neck.
[04:06.730 --> 04:08.670]  It was season two, Andrew, for sure.
[04:08.770 --> 04:10.510]  It was. Oh, that's such a great way to put it.
[04:10.550 --> 04:11.590]  That's exactly what it was.
[04:11.950 --> 04:17.350]  No, it was like I was possessed by Johnny Caviar or like,
[04:17.430 --> 04:18.970]  you know, that pill.
[04:19.610 --> 04:23.750]  So it says we went from summer of 98, season 98 to season two two.
[04:23.950 --> 04:25.090]  So this is season 22.
[04:26.030 --> 04:26.990]  2-2.
[04:27.670 --> 04:28.750]  2-2.
[04:29.050 --> 04:30.630]  Don't think about it too much.
[04:30.970 --> 04:33.890]  Does that start this episode or did that start last episode?
[04:34.030 --> 04:35.030]  I guess it was last episode.
[04:35.690 --> 04:36.350]  Yeah, I don't know.
[04:36.670 --> 04:38.290]  But that that that character arc is done.
[04:38.450 --> 04:41.870]  It was that was like it was like I took the pill from a limitless.
[04:42.030 --> 04:45.850]  But instead of unlocking my brain, it just unlocked all the snark.
[04:46.010 --> 04:48.670]  I could just whatever the snarkiest reply was.
[04:49.010 --> 04:50.910]  It dislodged to a snark cork.
[04:51.550 --> 04:55.010]  I spent I was well, we also recorded a SnowRunner's video.
[04:55.010 --> 04:57.450]  Later that day, and I'm so sorry about that, too.
[04:57.450 --> 04:59.050]  It extended into that.
[04:59.830 --> 05:04.590]  I went to bed that night scared that I wouldn't that this wouldn't.
[05:04.790 --> 05:05.850]  That's this is who I am.
[05:06.070 --> 05:07.270]  I am just now this person.
[05:07.850 --> 05:10.930]  I was walking around going, I don't know what's wrong with me today.
[05:10.990 --> 05:14.370]  And other people in my life were being like, yeah, I don't you're this is weird.
[05:14.770 --> 05:15.810]  You're acting weird today.
[05:16.290 --> 05:18.150]  And I felt I felt better.
[05:18.210 --> 05:21.370]  I think what it might have been, I think I've thought about this a lot.
[05:21.370 --> 05:24.910]  I think all of the conversation about killing me
[05:24.910 --> 05:29.770]  and my internal fight or flight, and I went fight mode
[05:29.770 --> 05:32.050]  and it lasted the rest of the day.
[05:32.310 --> 05:33.170]  You know, I think that's fair.
[05:33.250 --> 05:34.930]  And I don't think you have anything to be sorry for.
[05:35.350 --> 05:35.950]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[05:36.890 --> 05:39.230]  I just want to make sure that this is a real zazzle of an episode.
[05:39.330 --> 05:40.290]  So I just wanted to open up.
[05:40.570 --> 05:41.370]  Yeah, I apologize.
[05:41.790 --> 05:42.290]  I understand.
[05:42.750 --> 05:48.350]  I I just want you to know, Andrew, that I love the I love every season's Andrew.
[05:48.570 --> 05:49.450]  It doesn't matter.
[05:50.110 --> 05:51.270]  Whichever one of you I can get.
[05:52.030 --> 05:52.670]  No, that's not true.
[05:52.770 --> 05:53.290]  I love that.
[05:53.670 --> 05:54.590]  Well, OK, well, that's fine.
[05:54.650 --> 05:56.230]  You live your life, Gavin. I'm happy.
[05:56.230 --> 05:59.570]  No, that was that one season where you you were printing the law for the entire season.
[05:59.690 --> 06:00.270]  That was terrible.
[06:00.410 --> 06:01.050]  Andrew season.
[06:01.430 --> 06:03.410]  I would I would take that guy back in a second.
[06:03.550 --> 06:05.470]  Yeah, I did over.
[06:05.590 --> 06:06.630]  No, Andrew. Shit.
[06:07.490 --> 06:09.530]  I'll just you know, I'm happy.
[06:09.650 --> 06:10.210]  I'm happy to.
[06:10.310 --> 06:12.670]  Did you guys have coffee today that that was that able to have?
[06:13.190 --> 06:13.810]  No, no.
[06:13.830 --> 06:16.030]  We decided never to do that again after you.
[06:16.330 --> 06:17.430]  No. Yeah, yeah.
[06:17.430 --> 06:20.970]  I think I think they got really hurt by being it.
[06:20.990 --> 06:23.770]  No, getting the store actually closed down as well.
[06:27.570 --> 06:29.630]  No, no, no, no.
[06:29.650 --> 06:30.610]  We we haven't.
[06:30.750 --> 06:31.290]  We have a big guy.
[06:31.470 --> 06:32.170]  Gavin was out of town.
[06:32.230 --> 06:33.290]  He's playing with trampolines or something.
[06:33.590 --> 06:34.970]  Yeah, he's doing stuff.
[06:35.990 --> 06:37.570]  Geoff, you had you record episode.
[06:37.790 --> 06:38.090]  So all right.
[06:38.130 --> 06:39.650]  That was very vulnerable. Very nice.
[06:39.730 --> 06:41.070]  I'd recommend people listen to it.
[06:41.430 --> 06:42.830]  And I'm happy you guys again.
[06:42.910 --> 06:44.950]  Coffee. I hope you continue to get coffee.
[06:44.950 --> 06:49.450]  I hope my one day of sass has not chased away any potential coffee.
[06:49.590 --> 06:50.650]  What? Before?
[06:50.770 --> 06:52.330]  Here's what I here's what I hope.
[06:52.470 --> 06:54.850]  I hope that we don't get coffee for another six years
[06:54.850 --> 06:56.530]  because then I get to do another episode.
[06:56.630 --> 06:58.450]  That's a free episode for me six years from now.
[06:58.630 --> 06:59.810]  That's true. Yeah.
[07:00.230 --> 07:01.490]  You mentioned SnowRunner.
[07:01.610 --> 07:03.050]  We did an episode in SnowRunner.
[07:03.370 --> 07:06.570]  I'm hoping it's the first of many episodes of SnowRunner.
[07:06.650 --> 07:09.370]  But can I take a second since you took over the show for a little bit?
[07:09.450 --> 07:10.130]  Can I take a second?
[07:10.610 --> 07:15.330]  Take over the show a little bit to complain about how fucking SnowRunner
[07:15.330 --> 07:17.790]  is ruining my life.
[07:17.810 --> 07:19.430]  Fix the servers.
[07:20.010 --> 07:21.330]  It's unplayable.
[07:21.530 --> 07:23.790]  It's impossible to play.
[07:23.950 --> 07:26.010]  It's destroying my friendships.
[07:26.730 --> 07:28.590]  I have nothing to do.
[07:28.690 --> 07:30.750]  No, I don't want to play any other video games.
[07:30.750 --> 07:33.530]  We just want to play SnowRunner every night.
[07:33.550 --> 07:37.670]  And every night we beat our heads against the wall for four fucking hours
[07:37.670 --> 07:40.190]  just trying to play the goddamn game.
[07:40.230 --> 07:42.130]  Since the update, it's useless.
[07:43.650 --> 07:46.210]  You get dropped left and right multiple times.
[07:46.230 --> 07:47.230]  Oh, my God.
[07:47.390 --> 07:50.310]  Gavin, do you remember the one time you played
[07:50.310 --> 07:53.430]  before you got scared and never were available again,
[07:53.550 --> 07:55.730]  which was braver than anything Andrew ever did?
[07:55.790 --> 07:59.290]  Who told me he has to he's he's building up courage to play with us.
[07:59.450 --> 08:01.870]  Like he's playing with the fucking Harlem Globetrotters or something.
[08:02.090 --> 08:03.710]  It's just three idiots. I am.
[08:04.310 --> 08:07.450]  Yeah. Fucking that night we were trying to do
[08:07.450 --> 08:08.770]  we were trying to accomplish something.
[08:08.890 --> 08:11.610]  We were trying to go from the south of that one map in Russia
[08:11.610 --> 08:16.190]  to the north of another map in Russia to deliver some steel beams
[08:16.190 --> 08:20.930]  so that we could do part one of a task to unlock a garage.
[08:21.090 --> 08:25.690]  When you unlock the garage, that allows you to to to load up into a level.
[08:26.090 --> 08:27.850]  Otherwise, you have to drive to that map.
[08:27.910 --> 08:31.730]  But once there's a garage there, you can like you can spawn in that garage.
[08:31.810 --> 08:36.270]  Right. So it like really makes really makes life a lot easier when you have garages.
[08:37.070 --> 08:40.470]  So that night when you and I were playing, I don't remember how long ago that was, Gav,
[08:40.530 --> 08:43.050]  but you were driving that you were trying to carry that F-750 around, right?
[08:43.390 --> 08:49.350]  Yeah, that we've been trying to complete that phase of that mission since that night.
[08:49.570 --> 08:54.030]  We did it two nights ago, two nights ago.
[08:54.710 --> 08:58.290]  It it's taken us every single night, seven nights a week.
[08:58.330 --> 09:01.550]  It has taken us that long to stay in a game long enough
[09:01.550 --> 09:06.730]  and also to do what has turned out to be an incredibly impossible fucking mission.
[09:07.170 --> 09:08.970]  Oh, I picked the real one, didn't I?
[09:09.950 --> 09:16.050]  Probably 15 hours of work we've put into it at this point of getting dropped, of losing progress,
[09:16.430 --> 09:22.070]  of like doing everything in our power to get the game to work.
[09:22.190 --> 09:25.570]  Delete this DLC. Delete. Add that DLC. Fuck it.
[09:25.630 --> 09:28.570]  Try to load it this way. You know, don't accept that.
[09:28.570 --> 09:33.570]  Every single thing you can think of, turn this setting down, turn that setting off.
[09:33.690 --> 09:35.170]  Every single thing you can think of.
[09:35.490 --> 09:39.270]  And it's just been fucking a mess, dude.
[09:39.350 --> 09:42.170]  To the point where I didn't even play last night. I didn't even try.
[09:42.250 --> 09:43.090]  I was so despondent.
[09:43.410 --> 09:45.670]  They were playing a different game and I just didn't even feel like it.
[09:46.110 --> 09:48.510]  And so I don't know what to do.
[09:48.750 --> 09:52.690]  All I want to do, and the more it doesn't work, the more I want to play it.
[09:53.410 --> 09:57.890]  Do you have any knowledge that there's an issue or is it like just affecting you guys?
[09:57.890 --> 09:59.910]  You just you read about it on Reddit.
[10:00.110 --> 10:04.530]  It seems the consensus seems to be that the Xbox version is pretty fucking buggy.
[10:04.530 --> 10:06.190]  Should we switch to PC or something?
[10:06.490 --> 10:09.350]  Fuck you, dude. You know how many hours I have and how much work we've done?
[10:09.730 --> 10:12.990]  No, we just want the version that we're paying for to work.
[10:14.370 --> 10:16.070]  Trucks don't come. I think that's valid.
[10:16.610 --> 10:19.370]  I just dropped 90 bucks on DLC like three weeks ago.
[10:19.530 --> 10:20.510]  I want to use it.
[10:20.890 --> 10:24.230]  Oh, my God. It's free on Game Pass, isn't it?
[10:24.690 --> 10:26.650]  Yeah, but you gotta buy the seasons, dude.
[10:26.650 --> 10:27.810]  You gotta buy all the seasons.
[10:28.290 --> 10:30.150]  How much of that DLC do you have, Geoff?
[10:30.390 --> 10:32.450]  I have all of it. I have every piece of DLC in the game.
[10:32.650 --> 10:36.730]  That's that's what I figured, because I felt I felt so bad about the SnowRunner
[10:36.730 --> 10:37.810]  thing. I was like, you know what?
[10:37.830 --> 10:42.190]  Maybe I'll surprise Geoff and I'll gift him as he can give things on the Xbox store.
[10:42.510 --> 10:46.050]  I'm sure that game's got a bunch of skins and I'll throw a skin his way.
[10:46.190 --> 10:48.670]  And I looked at it. I thought Geoff has bought all of this.
[10:48.790 --> 10:50.750]  There's nothing you can get that Geoff doesn't already have.
[10:50.930 --> 10:52.870]  Yeah, it's because I love it that much.
[10:52.870 --> 10:55.850]  It's because it's that fucking good when it works.
[10:56.330 --> 10:59.310]  We should put out a part one on Andrew Pot.
[11:00.010 --> 11:01.930]  It's pretty soon. Yeah, I think we should.
[11:02.170 --> 11:03.370]  We got a lot of stuff to put out.
[11:03.770 --> 11:06.550]  You were so fucking sassy in that video, especially the first half.
[11:06.730 --> 11:08.070]  I was. Yeah, I was.
[11:08.170 --> 11:10.070]  I don't know what was going on. It was weird.
[11:10.290 --> 11:12.990]  Oh, man. That was the half where he had to do the tutorial, right?
[11:13.310 --> 11:13.890]  Yeah. Yeah.
[11:13.890 --> 11:15.430]  The first half was the tutorial. Great.
[11:15.850 --> 11:16.950]  That he had to do.
[11:17.110 --> 11:20.250]  Well, I don't want to spoil the video, but he had to do because he deleted his
[11:20.250 --> 11:21.750]  sequel in front of Eric and I.
[11:23.110 --> 11:24.730]  I feel like that wasn't a good idea.
[11:24.730 --> 11:28.590]  Because he had no achievement, so he never done that.
[11:28.810 --> 11:30.010]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's true. It's true.
[11:30.350 --> 11:31.490]  This is what happened.
[11:31.750 --> 11:33.250]  I've been thinking about this a lot.
[11:34.050 --> 11:36.150]  I played that game like you, Geoff.
[11:36.290 --> 11:38.230]  The some of the people I regularly play games with.
[11:38.390 --> 11:40.430]  We saw that when it first came on Game Pass.
[11:40.570 --> 11:42.850]  We're like, oh, let's have some trucking fun.
[11:43.350 --> 11:45.190]  And then it was beyond all of our depths.
[11:45.210 --> 11:49.390]  But we played it simultaneously at the same time.
[11:49.410 --> 11:52.730]  So in my head, I remembered that we did co-op together, but we never did.
[11:52.730 --> 11:56.950]  We were just trying to do the tutorial together and we all got stuck in the mud
[11:56.950 --> 11:59.550]  and just abandoned it as soon as we couldn't get out.
[12:00.550 --> 12:01.910]  So I yeah, that was bad.
[12:02.350 --> 12:06.090]  That was an all around not great performance by me, as well as my memory.
[12:07.110 --> 12:11.110]  I remember when Eric said, I've never seen the side of Andrew internally.
[12:11.210 --> 12:13.170]  I was thinking, I've never seen it either.
[12:13.370 --> 12:14.190]  This is crazy.
[12:15.370 --> 12:16.490]  I didn't know a heck.
[12:17.390 --> 12:20.650]  Oh, dude, that's so fucking funny.
[12:21.770 --> 12:22.870]  Oh, let's ask.
[12:23.050 --> 12:26.110]  I have a question that is like the most you guys have talked about
[12:26.110 --> 12:28.790]  the most boring contest before between the two of you.
[12:28.930 --> 12:33.090]  Oh, I have an idea, a challenge that is such a boring challenge,
[12:33.090 --> 12:35.590]  but I kind of want to do it, run it by you guys.
[12:36.010 --> 12:38.250]  You guys just watch cable anymore.
[12:38.450 --> 12:39.450]  You just watch TV.
[12:40.070 --> 12:43.490]  Like, I can't remember the last time I just tried to watch TV.
[12:44.270 --> 12:47.510]  Dude, I am I was about to make a reference
[12:47.510 --> 12:49.430]  that none of you guys are going to get, so I won't make it.
[12:49.430 --> 12:51.530]  But yes, I still watch TV.
[12:51.870 --> 12:53.150]  I'm a I love television.
[12:53.290 --> 12:55.950]  I love I mean, I usually have a purpose.
[12:56.210 --> 12:57.550]  It's usually sports or whatever.
[12:57.650 --> 13:00.550]  But there are times when I just want to have the experience of being a kid
[13:00.550 --> 13:02.610]  and being bored and flipping through the stations.
[13:02.770 --> 13:04.710]  And so I still do that a couple times a week.
[13:04.710 --> 13:06.070]  Probably love that.
[13:06.130 --> 13:08.830]  That's exactly because for me, everything is purposeful.
[13:08.850 --> 13:13.390]  So I have cable, but I'm watching like a specific sporting event when I go to it.
[13:13.650 --> 13:17.370]  I was thinking about being a kid and like just sitting in the summers,
[13:17.370 --> 13:20.830]  watching TV and just channel surfing and just not knowing
[13:20.830 --> 13:23.150]  and using that as my main form of entertainment.
[13:23.410 --> 13:25.690]  I haven't done that in probably like 20 years,
[13:25.870 --> 13:27.630]  but it sounds like you regularly do that.
[13:27.710 --> 13:32.190]  I wanted to spend just like two days just doing that, just trying to recreate
[13:32.190 --> 13:35.770]  just to see what that experience is, like what even is on cable now.
[13:36.270 --> 13:39.030]  My issue with cable, like I've tried this a few times
[13:39.030 --> 13:43.830]  because like I got YouTube TV during the World Cup and the Euros.
[13:44.510 --> 13:47.950]  And while I have it, I try just watching TV.
[13:48.450 --> 13:50.070]  But there's it's always an ad.
[13:50.310 --> 13:53.370]  Like if there's if I'm looking on the guide and I can see something's on
[13:53.370 --> 13:56.010]  and I try and watch it, I'm always watching it in the middle of an ad.
[13:56.090 --> 13:59.210]  No matter when I start watching television.
[13:59.870 --> 14:01.430]  There are so many ads.
[14:02.330 --> 14:04.550]  The nice thing about that is that it'll only be on
[14:04.550 --> 14:06.570]  the ad will only be on for about two and a half to three minutes
[14:06.570 --> 14:07.470]  and then you'll get to the show.
[14:07.890 --> 14:10.650]  Yeah, but then that'll be like four minutes of show and then another ad.
[14:10.650 --> 14:14.630]  Well, it's more like seven to eight minutes to show, but sure, it's a lot.
[14:16.270 --> 14:17.750]  That's just I don't know, man.
[14:17.790 --> 14:18.930]  That's the TV I grew up on.
[14:19.190 --> 14:21.230]  That's the American style of watching TV, I guess.
[14:21.330 --> 14:24.770]  But I think it's like, you know, they say like they say that kids now
[14:24.770 --> 14:28.470]  in the current age of kids are being raised by iPhones
[14:29.010 --> 14:30.150]  and iPads or whatever.
[14:30.450 --> 14:34.730]  I was very much an 80s latchkey kid and I was raised by a television.
[14:35.250 --> 14:36.510]  You know, my mom was at work.
[14:36.690 --> 14:37.910]  Most of the time I didn't have a dad.
[14:38.030 --> 14:40.510]  And so I watched so much fucking TV as a kid.
[14:40.510 --> 14:44.310]  And it was such a comfortable, welcoming place, just surfing board.
[14:44.710 --> 14:47.130]  Like it actually, I think, increases creativity.
[14:47.530 --> 14:49.470]  You stop on stuff, you get little ideas.
[14:49.950 --> 14:51.810]  I always end up watching these Southern dudes
[14:51.810 --> 14:54.210]  selling knives on some QVC channel.
[14:54.470 --> 14:55.410]  It's it's the best.
[14:56.710 --> 15:00.050]  I used to love watching the channel that just told you
[15:00.050 --> 15:02.170]  what was on other channels that was on.
[15:02.430 --> 15:04.210]  Oh, yeah, two favorites. It's a great channel.
[15:04.890 --> 15:07.090]  It's like how that's how like Mario Lopez lives, right?
[15:08.090 --> 15:09.110]  Exactly. Yeah.
[15:09.670 --> 15:11.970]  That and the Weather Network in December.
[15:12.210 --> 15:14.990]  I'm a big Weather Network guy, specifically in the month of December.
[15:15.130 --> 15:17.370]  I'll watch that. I'll throw that on.
[15:17.410 --> 15:20.470]  I love the idea of a guy just living between TV shows.
[15:25.440 --> 15:27.060]  Do you ever see that movie?
[15:27.360 --> 15:30.040]  What was it called? Changing Channels, maybe?
[15:30.880 --> 15:33.720]  Where John Ritter and I think Pam Dauber
[15:34.620 --> 15:38.840]  get sucked into a TV and then they're like in the shows on the TV.
[15:38.840 --> 15:42.560]  And when the kids change the channel, the like they change,
[15:42.680 --> 15:43.940]  it jumps them into the new TV.
[15:44.280 --> 15:45.560]  Like Tron for Telly.
[15:45.900 --> 15:47.020]  Like Tron for Telly. Yeah.
[15:47.080 --> 15:50.900]  And I think the bad guy was the bad guy was the devil,
[15:51.040 --> 15:52.740]  maybe who was fucking with the family.
[15:52.920 --> 15:54.480]  And I think I can't remember the guy's name.
[15:54.820 --> 15:57.160]  But but yeah, and so it was like the kids were watching TV
[15:57.160 --> 15:58.400]  and they're like, Mom and Dad are on TV.
[15:58.500 --> 16:00.580]  And they'd be like in an infomercial and they change the channel
[16:00.580 --> 16:03.080]  and they'd be like a crime drama and they'd be stuck in the crime drama.
[16:03.220 --> 16:04.160]  And yeah, that's cool.
[16:05.120 --> 16:07.200]  That's really cool. I've never heard of that.
[16:07.860 --> 16:09.940]  Yeah, we should maybe maybe we'll do a watch along or something.
[16:10.060 --> 16:11.480]  I don't know if it's bad enough to be good.
[16:11.800 --> 16:13.520]  Stay tuned. Stay tuned. Stay tuned.
[16:13.640 --> 16:14.760]  That's exactly what it's called. Yeah.
[16:15.760 --> 16:16.680]  That's a great name for it.
[16:17.780 --> 16:18.720]  I think I'm going to do this.
[16:18.960 --> 16:21.720]  Maybe I'll do some research, see if there's anything worth commenting.
[16:21.880 --> 16:25.040]  Gavin, you said it's just all commercials, which is funny
[16:25.040 --> 16:27.300]  because like at the time, commercials suck.
[16:27.660 --> 16:30.700]  But now I will actively look out commercials from my childhood.
[16:31.100 --> 16:32.800]  I love watching old commercial.
[16:33.020 --> 16:34.920]  Oh, yeah. The nostalgia stuff is great.
[16:35.600 --> 16:37.060]  Does that carry over?
[16:37.280 --> 16:40.720]  Like when you get older, Geoff, like when you're do you ever think about,
[16:40.900 --> 16:44.000]  oh, man, commercials when I was in my thirties or when I was 30?
[16:44.280 --> 16:45.720]  What a time that was.
[16:46.360 --> 16:49.340]  And because I feel like it's everyone's childhood when they think of commercials.
[16:49.620 --> 16:50.600]  It's just your childhood.
[16:51.000 --> 16:52.700]  This actually came up on ANMA the other day
[16:52.700 --> 16:54.420]  because we were talking about old coffee commercials.
[16:54.660 --> 16:56.480]  And that sent me on a tangent where I went home
[16:56.480 --> 17:00.600]  and I just watched a bunch of old Folgers and Brim coffee commercials.
[17:01.520 --> 17:03.040]  So it wasn't even just kid stuff.
[17:03.060 --> 17:04.340]  I think it's just that time of your life.
[17:04.340 --> 17:08.600]  But no, I do. I will say, you know, I pay attention to commercials
[17:08.600 --> 17:10.520]  during the Super Bowl every year because it's like an event
[17:10.520 --> 17:11.500]  and you want to see the funny ones.
[17:11.880 --> 17:13.640]  But I don't remember them after that night.
[17:13.720 --> 17:15.560]  I'll be like, oh, that was good on you.
[17:16.660 --> 17:18.360]  Fucking air freshener company.
[17:18.540 --> 17:19.440]  That was pretty funny.
[17:19.540 --> 17:21.520]  But then I it, you know, leaves my brain.
[17:22.060 --> 17:25.120]  Did George Clooney ever bang the woman in the Nescafe adverts?
[17:26.220 --> 17:27.340]  Did he ever get that done?
[17:28.180 --> 17:31.380]  Like in a commercial or you mean just sort of like?
[17:31.540 --> 17:33.140]  No, in the commercial, there was like it was like a big.
[17:33.560 --> 17:35.620]  You see, I just remember him and Danny DeVito.
[17:36.200 --> 17:37.680]  Danny DeVito was in him for a while, too.
[17:38.020 --> 17:40.600]  He by the way, George Clooney is still in those commercials.
[17:41.380 --> 17:43.600]  Yeah, I think so. It's Nespresso, right?
[17:44.080 --> 17:46.440]  Yeah. But there was like there was always like flirting.
[17:46.680 --> 17:48.920]  And then the next advert, they get a little further.
[17:49.220 --> 17:50.920]  But then I just never saw the end.
[17:51.320 --> 17:54.360]  The most recent one I saw, he was at a party.
[17:54.360 --> 17:55.720]  This was like a couple of weeks ago.
[17:56.980 --> 18:00.720]  And he and a lady had some kind of a bet and he lost it.
[18:00.760 --> 18:02.760]  And she got to drive away in his sports car.
[18:02.760 --> 18:04.780]  And he had to drive her pink scooter.
[18:05.660 --> 18:07.400]  They're geniuses, because we're talking.
[18:07.560 --> 18:11.440]  Gavin is curious about the narrative arc of the Nespresso ads.
[18:11.840 --> 18:13.240]  From my childhood together.
[18:14.020 --> 18:15.680]  Yeah. And it's still good.
[18:16.220 --> 18:18.600]  That's the story is still unfolding.
[18:19.860 --> 18:22.100]  He's just sat home and he hates his kids.
[18:22.580 --> 18:24.460]  Is there anyone that has done ads that long?
[18:24.780 --> 18:28.040]  Like I'm trying to think of like, I feel like they rotate out brand ambassadors
[18:28.040 --> 18:31.280]  too frequently to have like fucking low, dude.
[18:31.280 --> 18:33.160]  She's been going for a while.
[18:33.340 --> 18:34.580]  20 plus years, man.
[18:35.040 --> 18:37.100]  There you go. 20 fucking years.
[18:37.320 --> 18:40.480]  They did a really smart thing to extend the life of that.
[18:40.580 --> 18:42.640]  Wendy's just did it to the last couple of years.
[18:42.660 --> 18:43.640]  And I think it's fucking brilliant.
[18:44.200 --> 18:47.400]  They not that I'm like, I guess I do care about commercials.
[18:47.540 --> 18:49.000]  Here I am talking about. Yeah, you care.
[18:49.120 --> 18:49.740]  The ones that work.
[18:49.980 --> 18:54.280]  I think it's really fucking smart when you take a when you take a brand
[18:54.280 --> 18:59.600]  and then you build a a cast, like a working cast around it.
[18:59.600 --> 19:02.060]  Like the Wendy's employees that all have little personalities,
[19:02.240 --> 19:03.500]  almost like you're watching The Office.
[19:04.120 --> 19:08.100]  It's it really extends the life of those of those the characters.
[19:08.520 --> 19:10.700]  Those dudes made it for a long time. The Sonic guys.
[19:11.040 --> 19:13.340]  Yeah, the two hot guys in the car from if there were to
[19:13.340 --> 19:15.080]  if there would have been two more people in the back seat,
[19:15.180 --> 19:15.940]  they'd probably still be going.
[19:16.080 --> 19:18.620]  Yep. I've never seen these guys.
[19:18.760 --> 19:19.360]  What are they?
[19:19.460 --> 19:21.520]  You've never seen the two hot guys from the Sonic commercials?
[19:21.760 --> 19:22.940]  I don't get Sonic ads.
[19:23.100 --> 19:24.320]  What's hot about this? Oh.
[19:24.660 --> 19:28.400]  Oh, we just we just decided that these guys were on Face Jam.
[19:28.400 --> 19:30.720]  We decided these are the two hot guys because they're in ads.
[19:30.860 --> 19:32.120]  They must be attractive guys.
[19:32.240 --> 19:34.960]  So you're putting a Face Jam shit in this?
[19:35.240 --> 19:36.360]  Yeah, this is two hot guys.
[19:36.460 --> 19:39.080]  Well, yeah, the two hot guys from Sonic right there.
[19:39.160 --> 19:42.000]  Dude, you didn't catch him plugging a Face Jam shirt the entire time
[19:42.000 --> 19:43.880]  we were talking about Nick. He's always squeaking.
[19:43.880 --> 19:45.400]  Yeah, no kidding. I'm working, baby.
[19:46.220 --> 19:50.440]  My only question is, does it does it ever does it ever work the other way back?
[19:51.140 --> 19:53.280]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Excellent.
[19:53.440 --> 19:54.500]  Well, there you go. Fair trade.
[19:55.280 --> 19:56.220]  Not even trade.
[19:56.480 --> 19:58.660]  You guys don't yell at me when I do it.
[19:58.760 --> 20:00.140]  I get yelled at on the other show.
[20:00.560 --> 20:04.380]  Oh, so we should yell at you when you promote other podcasts?
[20:04.900 --> 20:08.280]  No, I mean, no, it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't change anything.
[20:08.280 --> 20:11.580]  I'm just saying I don't get yelled at on this one compared to the other one.
[20:12.020 --> 20:13.140]  But it changed how much you.
[20:14.040 --> 20:15.700]  Go ahead. You go.
[20:18.060 --> 20:20.300]  That was the most peckish.
[20:20.820 --> 20:21.860]  That was the smallest.
[20:22.640 --> 20:24.340]  I don't even know what to say that that was.
[20:24.340 --> 20:27.380]  That was the meekish is the word I was looking for.
[20:27.680 --> 20:29.960]  The most meekish you go.
[20:30.020 --> 20:31.220]  I've ever heard from anyone.
[20:31.700 --> 20:33.420]  I had no confidence in where I was going with that.
[20:33.780 --> 20:35.600]  Really? You said it's so defeated.
[20:36.700 --> 20:40.320]  I think Gavin feels bad for moving the time around a little bit.
[20:40.800 --> 20:44.900]  It sounded like your penis crawled inside of your body while you were talking.
[20:45.360 --> 20:45.900]  I think it did.
[20:46.000 --> 20:47.560]  There's a little twinge in the in the penis.
[20:48.780 --> 20:50.660]  You recessed. Oh, my God.
[20:51.100 --> 20:54.820]  Man. Well, I was going to say that we sold a Switch Fox.
[20:54.960 --> 20:59.020]  I think it's OK for Eric to bring up the hot guys every once in a while.
[20:59.080 --> 21:01.600]  Geoff saw that we sold a coin for face jam.
[21:01.660 --> 21:04.060]  And all of a sudden he's like, let me get my hands on this thing.
[21:04.460 --> 21:07.080]  And then we have another thing coming out for face jam.
[21:07.140 --> 21:08.900]  And Geoff went, oh, I want to steal that idea, too.
[21:08.960 --> 21:10.140]  And it's like, I mean, do it.
[21:10.200 --> 21:11.560]  The Falcon. Yeah.
[21:11.880 --> 21:14.360]  Every time face jam does something clever,
[21:14.720 --> 21:17.060]  I find a way to make it better for face.
[21:17.160 --> 21:19.800]  It happens so fast, too.
[21:19.800 --> 21:21.180]  It happened so quickly.
[21:21.420 --> 21:23.000]  It was so fast.
[21:23.660 --> 21:27.260]  I feel like since I hired all those people, it really like it's
[21:27.260 --> 21:28.740]  their ideas are mined by proxy.
[21:29.200 --> 21:31.420]  So that's the way that works. No.
[21:32.660 --> 21:34.700]  No, they just have really funny ideas.
[21:34.700 --> 21:36.660]  And you see them and you're like, oh, that's really cute.
[21:36.740 --> 21:39.160]  We could make a Falcon version of that. It would be even cuter.
[21:39.300 --> 21:40.540]  Oh, that's a great idea. Let's do it.
[21:40.560 --> 21:42.320]  Are we just spoiling that? Like what we're doing?
[21:42.360 --> 21:43.700]  Are we just saying what we're doing now?
[21:44.800 --> 21:45.720]  No, it's fine.
[21:45.920 --> 21:46.800]  You've already talked about that.
[21:47.940 --> 21:49.500]  You already talked about Falcon.
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.220]  We talked about that specific thing.
[21:52.580 --> 21:53.080]  Shoulder Falcon.
[21:54.180 --> 21:55.460]  Well, we've talked about it now.
[21:55.640 --> 21:56.660]  Yeah, no, Gavin.
[21:56.960 --> 21:59.740]  Gavin doesn't go to the merch meeting, so we must have.
[21:59.880 --> 22:01.720]  There's no other way in which he would go.
[22:02.700 --> 22:05.040]  Dude, we had a pretty good merch meeting yesterday.
[22:05.400 --> 22:06.900]  We had a very good merch meeting yesterday.
[22:07.780 --> 22:12.300]  This jersey that I that Tony dropped today.
[22:13.480 --> 22:14.340]  It's too much.
[22:14.940 --> 22:15.880]  It's too much?
[22:15.880 --> 22:19.900]  I think it's I love the idea of combining all this stuff together.
[22:19.940 --> 22:22.000]  But once I saw it all together, I thought it's a bit busy.
[22:22.060 --> 22:23.180]  Oh, no way. Really?
[22:23.360 --> 22:24.720]  I love it. I'm big. I'm OK.
[22:24.820 --> 22:26.700]  Hey, listen, we can hold a vote. I can be outvoted.
[22:26.820 --> 22:27.440]  This is a democracy.
[22:27.760 --> 22:29.200]  I think it's great.
[22:29.800 --> 22:31.320]  I saw it. So cool.
[22:31.660 --> 22:35.660]  So I saw it and I said, instead of combining two and three,
[22:35.700 --> 22:36.840]  maybe we just go with three.
[22:37.040 --> 22:40.480]  But if you guys like the new combination, I'm totally down with it.
[22:40.560 --> 22:42.340]  I think the combination is really cool.
[22:42.340 --> 22:47.400]  I just like if this jerseys that are louder than this exist.
[22:48.000 --> 22:48.780]  I know. I know.
[22:48.860 --> 22:50.800]  And I felt like three didn't go far enough.
[22:50.920 --> 22:52.960]  But the elements in it were really great.
[22:53.060 --> 22:55.000]  Like that's a real enough that.
[22:55.200 --> 22:58.820]  Yeah, that's that's the San Diego Padre City Connect is a real jersey.
[22:59.040 --> 23:01.340]  I don't think what we're doing here is that far off.
[23:01.780 --> 23:03.700]  Also, we should not share that image yet.
[23:04.840 --> 23:07.180]  I'm sharing it here so Gavin can see it.
[23:07.420 --> 23:08.380]  I will. Yeah.
[23:08.880 --> 23:10.400]  Can I have one of those?
[23:11.120 --> 23:12.180]  See, he likes it.
[23:12.460 --> 23:13.860]  This jersey. You like that, right?
[23:14.120 --> 23:16.540]  Yeah. OK. Yeah. Voted three to four.
[23:16.640 --> 23:17.800]  So. All right. Well, there you go.
[23:17.860 --> 23:19.480]  If Gavin wants it, we'll get we'll make it.
[23:19.540 --> 23:22.120]  I mean, it's it's look, don't get me wrong. It's disgusting.
[23:22.440 --> 23:24.420]  I want it. Oh, I think it looks great.
[23:24.720 --> 23:27.300]  I disagree. Here's I think that we can discuss this.
[23:27.620 --> 23:29.300]  So the jersey did well.
[23:29.300 --> 23:30.760]  And I keep running into people.
[23:31.180 --> 23:32.780]  By the way, I ran into so many.
[23:32.880 --> 23:34.780]  I went to a concert night before last.
[23:34.860 --> 23:36.220]  I should tell you guys about that in a minute.
[23:36.220 --> 23:40.340]  But I've actually run into a lot of people.
[23:40.640 --> 23:43.520]  And usually they ask about like, when's it going to be another Gerpler
[23:43.520 --> 23:44.100]  drop or whatever?
[23:44.300 --> 23:47.180]  But this year, I feel like so many people have come up and said, hey,
[23:47.200 --> 23:49.620]  I really I got a jersey and I just want, you know, I really like it.
[23:49.720 --> 23:50.860]  And it's a really good quality.
[23:51.200 --> 23:54.600]  Or like, yeah, I really I really enjoyed that jersey or I was bummed
[23:54.600 --> 23:55.260]  I couldn't get a jersey.
[23:55.420 --> 23:56.600]  Let me know when there's another drop.
[23:56.920 --> 24:01.880]  So there seems to be a lot of like genuine enthusiasm for more jerseys.
[24:01.880 --> 24:04.160]  And we were trying to figure out another one to design.
[24:04.160 --> 24:06.140]  And so the initial thought was that was our home jersey.
[24:06.240 --> 24:07.200]  We'll make an away jersey.
[24:07.380 --> 24:09.240]  But then we landed out in the merch meeting.
[24:09.300 --> 24:12.840]  Instead of that, maybe every year we'll just release in baseball.
[24:12.980 --> 24:13.400]  They do this.
[24:13.680 --> 24:17.060]  Well, I guess in all sports, they do this thing called city jerseys
[24:17.060 --> 24:20.120]  or city connect jerseys where they make a special jersey
[24:20.120 --> 24:22.840]  that they wear like 12 times a year in basketball.
[24:23.240 --> 24:26.680]  That is reminiscent of the city, like for the Boston Celtics,
[24:26.740 --> 24:29.480]  it would be more Boston themed than Celtics themed. Right.
[24:30.580 --> 24:34.000]  Or in the San Diego one, it would be like a bunch of highlighters
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.640]  in an office desk for some reason.
[24:38.540 --> 24:39.800]  And so we've laid out the idea.
[24:39.900 --> 24:42.220]  Maybe just yearly, we'll do a city connect jersey.
[24:42.540 --> 24:45.180]  And then so it'll be focused on like the first year we're going to do Key West.
[24:45.260 --> 24:47.360]  The next year, it might be Deputy Indiana or wherever.
[24:47.500 --> 24:49.140]  And then we'll just make a new one every year.
[24:49.460 --> 24:50.540]  I think it's such a great idea.
[24:50.620 --> 24:52.420]  And I love doing Key West is the first one.
[24:52.460 --> 24:57.340]  And this I love this design that that Tony's team put together.
[24:57.400 --> 24:58.180]  I think it's so cool.
[24:58.480 --> 24:59.580]  I think it's so crazy.
[24:59.740 --> 25:01.440]  You've won me over. Wow.
[25:02.200 --> 25:03.620]  Gavin, is there anything you would change about it?
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.700]  Oh, definitely not. It's perfect.
[25:06.040 --> 25:07.980]  I want to see Gavin wearing this jersey.
[25:08.260 --> 25:09.160]  It is the opposite.
[25:10.120 --> 25:12.360]  Everything about it is the opposite of you.
[25:12.680 --> 25:16.460]  Can we all get together and see if we could help me pull that off?
[25:17.240 --> 25:18.760]  Like what else I need to be wearing?
[25:19.360 --> 25:21.060]  Oh, I got you. I got you.
[25:21.840 --> 25:24.600]  You want to you want to look like you fit in wearing that jersey.
[25:24.740 --> 25:25.560]  I got you immediately.
[25:25.920 --> 25:30.080]  So, so I want to see you with the salmon
[25:30.080 --> 25:33.720]  salmon shorts on that jersey and your rainbow shoes.
[25:33.720 --> 25:34.980]  And I think you got that.
[25:35.540 --> 25:37.260]  You got to get just so much to look at.
[25:37.300 --> 25:38.500]  You're not really focused on anything.
[25:38.640 --> 25:41.880]  Exactly. Yeah, it's just it's a fun it's a fun vibe.
[25:42.160 --> 25:44.040]  Can I ask a question to the group?
[25:44.300 --> 25:44.880]  Yeah, go ahead.
[25:45.720 --> 25:49.580]  Has anyone had their anus waxed?
[25:50.200 --> 25:51.480]  No, no.
[25:51.980 --> 25:54.020]  I've never even considered it ever.
[25:54.400 --> 25:55.480]  Me neither. Right.
[25:55.960 --> 26:01.600]  But I had the realization this week that I think it would feel good.
[26:02.260 --> 26:03.700]  Oh, can we be there for this?
[26:03.780 --> 26:04.420]  Is that cool?
[26:04.980 --> 26:06.600]  What do you mean you think it would feel good?
[26:06.680 --> 26:07.780]  I don't think it would hurt.
[26:07.960 --> 26:08.740]  I don't think it would hurt.
[26:08.920 --> 26:10.960]  Oh, this rules to have the hair pulled.
[26:11.320 --> 26:11.720]  Yeah. Yeah.
[26:12.520 --> 26:13.440]  Here's what I think.
[26:13.840 --> 26:14.620]  Here's what I think.
[26:14.880 --> 26:18.000]  I think you're so desperate to have anybody touch your anus.
[26:18.160 --> 26:20.780]  You're coming up with medical reasons to do it
[26:20.780 --> 26:23.220]  just so that you can have the experience just to have.
[26:24.060 --> 26:25.100]  You don't have to go.
[26:25.920 --> 26:28.460]  What do you know how much it hurts to get waxed?
[26:28.480 --> 26:29.160]  Don't listen to them.
[26:29.160 --> 26:32.040]  I feel like you would like it like if you if you went back second crack.
[26:32.220 --> 26:35.580]  I cannot imagine my sack getting waxed.
[26:35.580 --> 26:37.960]  That would be so that would be ten out of ten painful.
[26:38.220 --> 26:43.280]  But I don't think the air, the skin around my asshole.
[26:43.580 --> 26:47.780]  I don't think it's as sensitive as ball or other area skin.
[26:48.440 --> 26:52.240]  I it's funny you say that because I was thinking about ball bag skin.
[26:52.600 --> 26:57.260]  Yeah. How funny it would be if ball bag skin was what the top of heads were.
[26:57.260 --> 27:00.860]  Just imagining like knockouts and boxing matches,
[27:00.860 --> 27:02.860]  how much funnier those impacts would be.
[27:02.960 --> 27:06.180]  Oh, like a sloppy, saggy head skin.
[27:06.360 --> 27:09.480]  Yeah, just like the slow motion of getting a knockout punch.
[27:09.480 --> 27:10.720]  If people have ball heads,
[27:11.840 --> 27:13.500]  I was making me laugh one evening.
[27:13.840 --> 27:17.220]  But so why would you want to get your asshole waxed?
[27:17.420 --> 27:18.140]  What is the reason?
[27:18.620 --> 27:19.880]  Yeah, he thinks it's going to feel good.
[27:20.060 --> 27:23.740]  I think it's a really weird way of saying you like your asshole touched
[27:23.740 --> 27:25.420]  or like played with. That's what I'm saying.
[27:25.980 --> 27:27.900]  Don't touch it or play with it. Wax it.
[27:28.040 --> 27:29.820]  That's it. Just tug the hair out.
[27:31.200 --> 27:34.920]  Do you think hair getting pulled is pleasurable in any other part of your body?
[27:38.220 --> 27:39.600]  The answer is no.
[27:39.700 --> 27:42.180]  Then it isn't about being the hair being pulled.
[27:42.480 --> 27:44.640]  Yeah, maybe he's on to something.
[27:46.380 --> 27:48.500]  There's areas of my skin that feel really numb.
[27:49.160 --> 27:51.680]  And if I pull hair out of those doesn't hurt.
[27:52.060 --> 27:54.220]  Is your ass one of those places?
[27:54.220 --> 27:55.700]  No, no, interesting.
[27:56.080 --> 27:58.040]  The thing is, it's just a theory.
[27:58.400 --> 27:59.180]  It's just a theory.
[27:59.420 --> 28:01.460]  Yeah, I know. And we have to put it into practice.
[28:01.720 --> 28:02.500]  Yeah, we're going to.
[28:03.120 --> 28:04.300]  I'll tell you what, dude.
[28:04.540 --> 28:05.360]  I'll tell you what.
[28:05.480 --> 28:08.200]  I think it'll hurt a lot to get my asshole waxed.
[28:08.200 --> 28:11.160]  But what if we go get our assholes waxed together? OK.
[28:12.520 --> 28:14.800]  Yeah, that's a supplemental I would sign up for.
[28:14.800 --> 28:18.040]  I mean, I'm I'm looking I'm trying to look at one that will come to us
[28:18.040 --> 28:19.060]  and we do it somewhere.
[28:19.180 --> 28:20.140]  Even even better.
[28:20.340 --> 28:22.880]  That's I'm I'm looking it's it's harder.
[28:23.560 --> 28:27.160]  It appears to be harder than I anticipated.
[28:30.300 --> 28:32.580]  A come a come to you wax.
[28:32.760 --> 28:35.520]  Yeah, I come to you anal waxers.
[28:35.900 --> 28:36.920]  Oh, my God.
[28:37.200 --> 28:38.660]  That's a real niche market.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.980]  Yeah. Emily owns a salon.
[28:41.100 --> 28:43.500]  She probably knows tons of people that wax assholes.
[28:43.840 --> 28:45.600]  I can just ask her if one of her friends will do it.
[28:45.820 --> 28:48.760]  Yeah, well, if she says no, Gracie has a really good idea
[28:48.760 --> 28:51.120]  where we hire someone from TaskRabbit.
[28:51.120 --> 28:52.560]  Oh, perfect.
[28:55.040 --> 28:55.840]  I don't.
[28:55.920 --> 28:58.720]  Hmm. How do we do it like privately?
[29:00.200 --> 29:03.940]  So we're not just privately, but like, yeah, I think there are people
[29:03.940 --> 29:05.660]  who I work with are looking at my asshole.
[29:05.860 --> 29:06.660]  No, no, no, I get it.
[29:06.760 --> 29:07.920]  Stranger to be messing with it.
[29:08.000 --> 29:08.640]  No, no, I understand.
[29:08.800 --> 29:10.560]  I think I think we can do it.
[29:10.780 --> 29:13.360]  And I think it has to do with.
[29:14.400 --> 29:15.940]  Oh, I found a place, I think.
[29:16.460 --> 29:22.300]  Um, it's called Twig and Berry's Brazilian Shaft Sack and Crack, 80 bucks.
[29:23.620 --> 29:26.240]  Now, I don't want anyone to touch my shaft or anything.
[29:26.520 --> 29:29.200]  Just oh, oh, OK, then they have full booty for 45.
[29:30.180 --> 29:32.740]  OK, so what we can do, we'll get Gavin a full booty.
[29:33.040 --> 29:34.540]  I'll do also do the full booty.
[29:34.740 --> 29:39.480]  Oh, wow. And then we'll set up a we'll set up a GoPro for our on our faces.
[29:39.540 --> 29:42.960]  And then the other person will be on the other side of the door.
[29:42.960 --> 29:47.280]  Yes. And we'll film their reaction while we all listen through the door.
[29:47.500 --> 29:52.040]  Why don't we just put our heads through a hole in the wall?
[29:52.880 --> 29:55.040]  Why is there why? Where is there a hole in the wall?
[29:56.580 --> 29:57.500]  What are you, a guillotine?
[29:58.080 --> 29:59.340]  No, I like the idea.
[29:59.640 --> 30:01.900]  That's how they film the MGM Lion logo.
[30:02.040 --> 30:07.560]  Why don't we make like your guy's face equivalent to the MGM Lion logo?
[30:07.580 --> 30:09.240]  That's why he's rolling in the logo.
[30:09.460 --> 30:10.700]  He's getting his ass waxed.
[30:11.640 --> 30:16.800]  All right. So if it's like we do it where it looks like a lion, like the lion roar from the MGM Lion logo.
[30:16.880 --> 30:18.880]  I think that's the way. Yeah, I like that.
[30:19.180 --> 30:21.040]  So, OK, we'll we'll figure out.
[30:21.220 --> 30:25.940]  It might have to be more of like a sheet situation where it's being held up or something.
[30:26.180 --> 30:29.160]  We've got a record of wax roars.
[30:29.240 --> 30:31.820]  And we've got to play those before face supplemental.
[30:32.120 --> 30:36.700]  Yes, this is a great idea.
[30:36.700 --> 30:46.890]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[30:51.490 --> 30:53.790]  This is great. I'm so excited.
[30:53.970 --> 30:55.770]  Oh, I'm so excited to see that.
[30:56.290 --> 30:57.630]  I'm sweating. I'm fucking sweating.
[30:59.310 --> 31:04.110]  That I think this is the most wrong you've ever been, but in the most delightful of ways.
[31:04.110 --> 31:05.130]  I'm so excited.
[31:05.410 --> 31:07.150]  I would love the opinion of the audience on this one.
[31:07.210 --> 31:11.030]  If anyone's had it done, male or female, around the ages, let me know.
[31:11.030 --> 31:14.670]  My goal is to get this done before this episode comes out.
[31:14.750 --> 31:16.050]  So that way, no one can talk.
[31:16.250 --> 31:16.850]  Oh, my God.
[31:17.110 --> 31:18.650]  Yeah, I really, truly.
[31:18.990 --> 31:23.850]  We just created we just created the new face supplemental intro.
[31:23.850 --> 31:25.270]  And I cannot wait to start.
[31:25.850 --> 31:27.910]  It's going to be two different vibes, too.
[31:27.970 --> 31:30.570]  It'll be Geoff screaming and Gavin going, oh,
[31:33.790 --> 31:35.110]  two different notes.
[31:36.430 --> 31:39.550]  Gavin, you have to tell us if you have an orgasm.
[31:39.550 --> 31:40.790]  Oh, my God.
[31:41.090 --> 31:43.470]  So sexual. Oh, yeah, right.
[31:45.170 --> 31:47.750]  Gavin suddenly raises four inches.
[31:52.130 --> 31:54.470]  Oh, man. Oh, that's great, Gavin.
[31:56.050 --> 31:57.750]  That's a fantastic idea.
[31:57.830 --> 31:59.110]  I can't believe you believe this.
[31:59.490 --> 32:00.330]  Gavin, that's what it's got to be.
[32:00.330 --> 32:01.810]  All time top Gavin moment.
[32:01.890 --> 32:02.650]  Thank you so much.
[32:02.910 --> 32:06.210]  Oh, Eric, you you get involved.
[32:06.430 --> 32:08.770]  Oh, fuck. No, absolutely not.
[32:08.830 --> 32:10.830]  You're out of your fucking mind for doing.
[32:10.830 --> 32:12.610]  But you're kind of like a hardcore dude.
[32:12.870 --> 32:14.850]  Like, dude, like, yeah, you're a hard.
[32:15.890 --> 32:20.330]  And I don't get in the ring to show off my waxed ass.
[32:20.490 --> 32:21.790]  You don't have to show arguing.
[32:22.310 --> 32:24.510]  You're arguing this is a thing done for pleasure.
[32:24.690 --> 32:25.950]  You think this is a great thing?
[32:26.030 --> 32:28.170]  Like, why are you saying you're a hardcore dude?
[32:28.470 --> 32:28.850]  You're a hard.
[32:28.910 --> 32:32.390]  You know how hardcore dudes like the joy of getting their ass waxed?
[32:32.430 --> 32:34.930]  Well, it's just quite an extreme thing to do for a podcast.
[32:35.470 --> 32:37.190]  It's kind of an extreme work thing.
[32:37.850 --> 32:39.690]  But I'm saying that it's not extreme.
[32:39.690 --> 32:41.210]  If you think it's pleasurable,
[32:42.270 --> 32:44.450]  we can change your nickname to Smooth Gooch.
[32:45.270 --> 32:47.510]  I don't want anything to do with this.
[32:47.810 --> 32:51.470]  I will be there to film it, but I will not be participating.
[32:52.350 --> 32:53.410]  All right. It's just Gavin and I.
[32:53.530 --> 32:54.390]  And maybe it's Nick. Absolutely.
[32:55.390 --> 32:56.050]  I'm not going to.
[32:56.090 --> 32:57.590]  You guys are insane for doing you.
[32:57.750 --> 32:59.890]  You're nuts to think this is going to feel good.
[32:59.990 --> 33:01.450]  I can't wait to watch this.
[33:01.650 --> 33:02.430]  Yeah, but not the nuts.
[33:03.190 --> 33:05.870]  If we try to do it with Nick, you'll say, oh, I got mine done last week.
[33:05.870 --> 33:09.150]  I got mine done in preparation for Disney.
[33:14.890 --> 33:16.490]  We've been doing a lot of Let's Play stuff.
[33:16.590 --> 33:18.290]  There's nothing better than when you're playing games,
[33:18.350 --> 33:20.570]  having some Gamer Supps alongside you.
[33:20.830 --> 33:24.210]  Let me explain what Gamer Supps are, if you don't know already, which you should.
[33:24.690 --> 33:28.650]  Gamer Supps is a healthier, more affordable alternative to energy drinks or soda.
[33:29.370 --> 33:33.290]  Gamer Supps helps you stay focused during the day without a crash or regret.
[33:33.730 --> 33:36.830]  And that's the worst thing about having sugary drinks or like energy drinks.
[33:36.830 --> 33:39.750]  You get that crash, you feel that high and it's great for a time.
[33:39.850 --> 33:44.910]  But I have definitely experienced the decline that happens with those products,
[33:44.950 --> 33:47.190]  which you do not have with Gamer Supps.
[33:47.390 --> 33:50.670]  They have a caffeine free option for people trying to stay away from sugary drinks
[33:50.670 --> 33:54.490]  and one serving for eight ounces of cold water, which is fantastic.
[33:55.030 --> 33:57.570]  A limit of one order of free samples per household.
[33:57.730 --> 33:59.950]  So if you want to try some free samples, it's available to you.
[34:00.110 --> 34:01.890]  Worldwide shipping, which is great.
[34:01.990 --> 34:04.510]  As somebody in Canada, that can be a really annoying thing to deal with.
[34:04.750 --> 34:06.150]  Every tub is $39.99.
[34:06.610 --> 34:09.250]  And it's keto friendly as well as diabetic safe, which is awesome.
[34:09.630 --> 34:11.590]  Just being able to have options for everybody.
[34:11.970 --> 34:19.310]  I personally have tried the titty milk flavor as well as the snake oil one.
[34:19.650 --> 34:22.770]  They're delicious, flavorful, best titty milk I've ever had.
[34:23.130 --> 34:29.230]  So go to GamerSupps.gg and use code FACE to get free shipping on free samples

[36:13.970 --> 36:18.230]  We're coming into the holiday season and I personally love it.
[36:18.310 --> 36:19.810]  This is my favorite time of year.
[36:19.810 --> 36:27.990]  October, November, December brings me so much joy, but it's also something or a time that is filled with stress.
[36:28.090 --> 36:30.350]  You have so many different things going on.
[36:30.410 --> 36:35.050]  Also, just seasonally, I know it can be really difficult for people not getting a lot of sun.
[36:35.470 --> 36:39.530]  It's a complex thing that for me, it brings a lot of joy.
[36:39.590 --> 36:41.350]  But I understand it's it's difficult for a lot of people.
[36:41.370 --> 36:48.870]  And even in that joy, there's pressure of like getting gifts and just wanting to make sure that the people in your life feel appreciated.
[36:48.870 --> 36:59.570]  Which is something that is hard to feel, I guess, for me, not in the sense of like I can do a lot of things, but just with my anxiety.
[36:59.690 --> 37:08.110]  It can be difficult to feel like I'm really conveying those messages or even when I know they are just convincing my silly brain that that's the truth.
[37:08.250 --> 37:14.850]  I'm kind of rambling, but this year can be a lot and it's natural to feel sadness or anxiety about it.
[37:15.150 --> 37:18.490]  But adding something new and positive to your life can counteract some of those feelings.
[37:18.930 --> 37:26.190]  Therapy can be a bright spot amid all of the stress and change, something to look forward to, to make you feel grounded and give you tools to manage everything going on.
[37:27.030 --> 37:30.510]  As I say, every time I talk about this therapy, I think it's so important.
[37:30.690 --> 37:44.510]  It's something that has helped me in countless ways, just talking to a professional about issues you're going through or even just to get a personal inventory on yourself and in ways that you might not realize you need help.
[37:45.230 --> 37:57.110]  Or I've had experiences where I thought I was struggling with one thing and then upon talking to somebody, I realize, oh, wow, this is actually like four other things that have nothing to do with what I thought the heart of the issue was.
[37:57.250 --> 38:00.790]  And once you get to a point where you know what that is, you can start working on it.
[38:00.890 --> 38:03.730]  And going through that process has changed my life.
[38:04.010 --> 38:06.770]  So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.

[38:30.510 --> 38:34.530]  Andrew, would you do it up in Canada out of solidarity just to see what it's like?
[38:35.510 --> 38:37.030]  I'll have to think about that.
[38:37.130 --> 38:40.410]  I don't I don't I don't my initial reaction is no.
[38:40.410 --> 38:44.530]  But what if we got you an at home kit and you could do it self-administer?
[38:45.990 --> 38:52.170]  Oh, I would be like when when when parents are trying to like pull their kids teeth out, you could tie it to a door handle.
[38:54.830 --> 38:59.510]  Yes. You kick, you slam the door and it rips your your ass hair off.
[38:59.990 --> 39:05.190]  If I will have to look at like what options are available at home, I would be willing to do it live on the show.
[39:05.190 --> 39:07.670]  If we could do it at home in some capacity.
[39:08.910 --> 39:09.910]  I'm open to that.
[39:10.390 --> 39:14.850]  That would be what are we talking like standard anatomy down there?
[39:14.930 --> 39:16.950]  Like I know you've got a tree trunk neck and a long back.
[39:17.030 --> 39:17.850]  Like how's the gooch?
[39:18.150 --> 39:21.190]  Yeah, no, it's I think it's a pretty regulation gooch.
[39:21.390 --> 39:22.150]  I'd say. Regulation gooch?
[39:22.250 --> 39:23.750]  OK. Not a lot of hair.
[39:24.230 --> 39:27.730]  Really? Do you do you have a bowling ball in your in your home at all?
[39:28.450 --> 39:34.610]  I own the Big Lebowski Collector Edition, which is like in a plastic bowling ball with the discs inside.
[39:34.610 --> 39:37.730]  But you probably don't want to you probably don't want to throw that out a window.
[39:37.850 --> 39:42.810]  But wouldn't it be funny if we if you were going to tie it to the door handle and slam the door shut to rip it off?
[39:43.130 --> 39:44.570]  What if we built a pulley system?
[39:44.690 --> 39:49.390]  And so it went over like across the ceiling to your window and you like tied it to a brick
[39:49.390 --> 39:52.470]  and you throw the brick out the window and that's what slams the door shut.
[39:52.490 --> 39:55.250]  Oh, the longest Rube Goldberg asshole thing.
[39:55.370 --> 39:58.090]  Yeah. Like what if we do a Rube Goldberg wax?
[39:59.050 --> 40:03.170]  I don't have one, but it's imagining tying it to like a ceiling fan
[40:03.170 --> 40:04.870]  that spins is also very funny.
[40:05.130 --> 40:07.490]  That's a great or a moving car.
[40:09.430 --> 40:12.670]  And then you don't know when that like you just tie it to a car in the parking lot
[40:12.670 --> 40:13.830]  and you don't know when they're going to leave.
[40:13.950 --> 40:15.430]  So you just sit and it'll be a surprise.
[40:16.210 --> 40:18.190]  A series of helium balloons.
[40:18.770 --> 40:22.410]  You need enough force for the pole, but you don't know exactly when it's going to happen.
[40:22.410 --> 40:24.290]  It ends up just being a light tug on your ass.
[40:28.210 --> 40:31.430]  What are the options, Eric, for at home waxing kits?
[40:31.430 --> 40:35.430]  I'll have to I'll have to look because I'm not sure.
[40:35.670 --> 40:37.970]  I've only just found the.
[40:38.270 --> 40:39.990]  Gracie says there's many great.
[40:40.090 --> 40:41.070]  I mean, Grace is probably right.
[40:41.190 --> 40:42.110]  I'm sure there's a lot.
[40:43.270 --> 40:45.010]  So we can find some stuff.
[40:45.090 --> 40:47.830]  We'll send you something so you can do it live on the show.
[40:47.970 --> 40:52.450]  I am looking at maybe next Thursday getting an appointment.
[40:52.710 --> 40:56.770]  I'm just I'm looking right now to see if this space is available and everything.
[40:56.830 --> 40:59.850]  This would be great to do before my wedding, just in case there's any.
[41:00.310 --> 41:01.310]  Oh, I absolutely.
[41:01.470 --> 41:02.910]  Yeah, I absolutely agree.
[41:03.150 --> 41:05.430]  You should definitely tell Emily that we're going to do this.
[41:06.030 --> 41:06.630]  Yeah, absolutely.
[41:07.010 --> 41:10.630]  Yeah, I found I mean, I think I found the right place for us.
[41:10.690 --> 41:11.410]  It's not too far.
[41:11.490 --> 41:13.030]  And I feel good about it.
[41:13.110 --> 41:18.370]  I found another place that just offers men's Brazilian or crevice and scrotum.
[41:20.570 --> 41:23.050]  Man, I feel like scrotum would hurt so bad.
[41:23.050 --> 41:24.710]  I don't want that. I don't want that messed with.
[41:24.850 --> 41:25.710]  No, no, I understand.
[41:26.090 --> 41:28.730]  So I'm looking I'm I found a place.
[41:28.730 --> 41:30.630]  It's looking good right now.
[41:31.070 --> 41:35.430]  I'm going to contact them, ask them about the filming situation,
[41:35.690 --> 41:37.630]  because that's really all we can like.
[41:37.990 --> 41:39.870]  We have to film this. We have to.
[41:40.150 --> 41:40.990]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, we have.
[41:41.170 --> 41:42.910]  Oh, and we have to do the intro thing.
[41:43.050 --> 41:44.090]  We have to have the faces.
[41:44.530 --> 41:47.710]  Yeah, we mount a camera looking down with our heads through a thing.
[41:50.690 --> 41:51.790]  We'll get it. We'll get it.
[41:51.850 --> 41:52.750]  It's so funny.
[41:53.930 --> 41:56.330]  It was just going to say like a uniform production.
[41:57.090 --> 41:57.570]  Yeah.
[42:00.190 --> 42:02.290]  And the Roman numerals for 2023.
[42:02.950 --> 42:03.990]  Really? We could get.
[42:04.070 --> 42:07.950]  I learned when I made a video with Nick that he's a tuba player,
[42:07.970 --> 42:09.110]  so he could do the music.
[42:09.230 --> 42:12.830]  He could do that, like the tuba could be in the background of like the film intro.
[42:16.110 --> 42:18.070]  Well, we have something here.
[42:18.930 --> 42:20.730]  Oh, I think we definitely do.
[42:21.350 --> 42:24.350]  Oh, you all time bad idea by Gavin.
[42:24.350 --> 42:27.910]  And I'm like, yeah, I mean, I was wondering what we were going to talk about today.
[42:27.990 --> 42:30.130]  I should never wonder that ever again.
[42:30.530 --> 42:33.390]  This was the craziest part. Unprovoked.
[42:33.990 --> 42:35.470]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:35.870 --> 42:37.090]  Yeah, just out of the blue.
[42:38.090 --> 42:39.890]  I shot out of an anal cannon.
[42:40.010 --> 42:41.190]  It's just one of my notes for the day.
[42:43.250 --> 42:46.410]  Something we talked about before, Geoff, you hearing voices when you were
[42:46.410 --> 42:47.310]  you're falling asleep.
[42:47.590 --> 42:51.270]  And I saw a lot of people supporting you with similar experience.
[42:51.270 --> 42:54.470]  I have started to have a similar issue,
[42:55.530 --> 42:59.110]  but I am I'm roasting myself in my dreams.
[42:59.350 --> 43:02.390]  And it is ever since you talked about hearing voices, it is
[43:02.390 --> 43:04.270]  it has become a problem for me.
[43:04.450 --> 43:06.130]  It's happened three times now.
[43:06.310 --> 43:07.690]  Well, it's just you talking shit.
[43:08.190 --> 43:11.770]  It's me talking shit about myself.
[43:12.170 --> 43:13.550]  I'll tell you what the dream is.
[43:13.810 --> 43:14.830]  It's what happens.
[43:15.050 --> 43:17.370]  What is happening now is in my dream,
[43:17.790 --> 43:20.750]  I'll be like walking past a group of people talking.
[43:21.270 --> 43:24.610]  And they'll be trying to they'll be saying something that they think is funny.
[43:24.850 --> 43:25.910]  And they'll say it.
[43:26.070 --> 43:31.010]  And my reaction will be, oh, my God, that was so unfunny.
[43:31.170 --> 43:32.430]  That was just awful.
[43:32.530 --> 43:36.590]  Like, I am so thankful that their brain is not mine.
[43:36.650 --> 43:39.770]  And what in the world that I view what is funny and isn't funny.
[43:40.170 --> 43:44.050]  And then I have a realization that I'm in my own dream.
[43:44.070 --> 43:46.790]  And that person, I created that person.
[43:46.850 --> 43:49.770]  And that person's thoughts only exist because it's in my head.
[43:49.770 --> 43:51.730]  And I am the source of that.
[43:51.990 --> 43:53.350]  And then I have to live with that.
[43:53.430 --> 43:54.170]  I wake up ashamed.
[43:54.450 --> 43:57.610]  I wake up like, oh, God, I feel gross because that person,
[43:57.770 --> 43:59.170]  that was such an unfunny thing.
[43:59.750 --> 44:01.070]  It's like a shame-ception.
[44:01.710 --> 44:03.070]  It's like a shame. Yes.
[44:04.210 --> 44:08.030]  It's an inception, but it's just for shame relating to comedy.
[44:08.570 --> 44:11.430]  It's I I get and there's no defense like it.
[44:11.630 --> 44:13.190]  It's a realization I have in the dream.
[44:13.210 --> 44:14.850]  And I just go, oh, fuck, this is all me.
[44:15.150 --> 44:17.250]  I can't say that I don't have that brain.
[44:17.290 --> 44:18.190]  It's in my brain.
[44:18.190 --> 44:19.890]  This is I've invented all this.
[44:20.090 --> 44:21.330]  Do you have any examples that you remember?
[44:21.910 --> 44:22.990]  No, I don't.
[44:23.150 --> 44:25.750]  Unfortunately, next time it happens, I'll really try to make an effort.
[44:25.830 --> 44:30.450]  But it's just it's jokes that are like so either lazy or just like,
[44:30.530 --> 44:32.210]  I don't know, they're just bad.
[44:33.130 --> 44:34.090]  They're just like you.
[44:34.230 --> 44:36.190]  The type of thing you would hear where you just be like,
[44:36.210 --> 44:39.390]  well, that person has no concept of what funny is.
[44:43.170 --> 44:44.150]  It's happened a lot.
[44:44.470 --> 44:46.610]  I'm sorry you've been afflicted with that dream.
[44:46.610 --> 44:50.050]  I honestly, I used to when I was having ankle issues,
[44:50.190 --> 44:54.270]  I'd re injure my ankle all the time in my sleep because I was having dreams
[44:54.270 --> 44:57.670]  that I would fall and then I'd physically do the motion and it would re hurt it.
[44:57.830 --> 44:59.930]  I would take those over the shame, I feel.
[45:00.430 --> 45:03.530]  Well, now you're just injuring your pride in your sleep.
[45:03.550 --> 45:05.190]  Yeah, it's just shame-ception.
[45:05.530 --> 45:06.430]  That's such a great way to put it.
[45:06.430 --> 45:08.930]  What would actually injure the ankle in your sleep?
[45:09.990 --> 45:11.030]  It would be the most.
[45:11.470 --> 45:15.230]  No, it would be like I stepped off a curve wrong or curb
[45:15.230 --> 45:18.670]  like I stepped off a curb or like I was walking off of something
[45:18.670 --> 45:23.530]  and then my ankle would roll and then I'd wake up and my ankle would physically roll.
[45:23.710 --> 45:25.330]  But how would it roll in the bed, though?
[45:26.190 --> 45:29.650]  Like my my my the body part, like I'd curve my ankle in.
[45:29.790 --> 45:31.370]  Like I do the physical motion.
[45:31.390 --> 45:32.910]  I can see I can see that.
[45:33.010 --> 45:36.290]  I can you're not you're not hitting it on the wall or like in the dirt.
[45:36.370 --> 45:37.710]  You're just moving your ankle.
[45:38.330 --> 45:42.470]  Well, yeah, but it's when like the ankle is really sore and like moving it hurts.
[45:42.490 --> 45:43.770]  So like I'm curving it,
[45:43.770 --> 45:46.810]  like I'm stretching those tendons when they're trying to heal.
[45:47.210 --> 45:49.410]  It's like it's like in the Matrix, like your body makes it real.
[45:51.510 --> 45:52.870]  Yes. Yes, it does.
[45:53.450 --> 45:56.030]  It sucks. It's not a fun time.
[45:56.490 --> 45:57.850]  You know what else isn't a fun time?
[45:58.030 --> 45:59.810]  I need to rant about something. Please do.
[46:00.270 --> 46:03.690]  I've been having to eat fucking hoagie sandwiches every day
[46:03.690 --> 46:07.270]  because PlayStation doesn't know how to make a console.
[46:07.550 --> 46:09.010]  I'm so goddamn mad.
[46:09.450 --> 46:13.450]  I bought this. We're doing the let's we're doing the let's play stuff, Gavin.
[46:13.770 --> 46:17.850]  Yeah. And I've I've wanted to incorporate some older games.
[46:17.990 --> 46:19.570]  And Eric and I were talking about that.
[46:19.650 --> 46:21.830]  There's a Sopranos game that I always wanted to play.
[46:21.950 --> 46:25.170]  So we're like, oh, that'd be such a fun game for the two of us to go through.
[46:25.350 --> 46:29.490]  So I bought an original launch PS3
[46:29.490 --> 46:32.450]  because only the launch PS3s have backwards
[46:32.450 --> 46:34.870]  compatibility for both PS1 and PS2.
[46:35.050 --> 46:36.530]  And then I got a copy of the game.
[46:36.710 --> 46:38.910]  It's tough to find. It is like a whole thing.
[46:39.270 --> 46:41.950]  I get everything we're supposed to record this week.
[46:41.950 --> 46:44.010]  I wanted to really get into the experience.
[46:44.210 --> 46:48.650]  So I bought all of the things for the Tony Soprano sandwich and I got hoagies.
[46:49.030 --> 46:51.130]  I bought a pack of six. This is going to be great.
[46:51.210 --> 46:55.050]  The night before, I go to set everything up and it just won't work
[46:55.050 --> 46:56.870]  and I can't figure out what's wrong.
[46:57.250 --> 46:58.230]  So then I Google it.
[46:59.250 --> 47:04.610]  Every PS3 on a hardware level does not let you capture through HDMI.
[47:05.170 --> 47:07.950]  They block it. Yeah, HDCP protection.
[47:08.450 --> 47:10.330]  Yeah. Well, I didn't know that.
[47:10.330 --> 47:13.550]  I had zero awareness that was a thing that was on a hardware level.
[47:14.210 --> 47:16.750]  Yeah. Yeah, I guess I did know that.
[47:17.690 --> 47:20.170]  Oh, is that great?
[47:20.370 --> 47:22.570]  That might be why you were using component cables.
[47:22.710 --> 47:24.030]  Now that I think about it. Yeah.
[47:25.790 --> 47:28.470]  For the video with the wet and purple or whatever.
[47:29.730 --> 47:30.790]  That's really funny.
[47:32.490 --> 47:34.950]  So I've been looking into a fix and I found one.
[47:34.990 --> 47:38.170]  I ordered it and I guess that company realized
[47:38.170 --> 47:42.090]  that their splitter was removing HDCP when it's not supposed to.
[47:42.250 --> 47:44.010]  So they updated it. So it didn't work.
[47:44.110 --> 47:45.470]  So I just bought a pointless splitter.
[47:45.730 --> 47:48.810]  So now I bought I bought another one.
[47:48.890 --> 47:50.770]  I'm two splitters and hopefully this one works.
[47:50.890 --> 47:52.850]  I just want to play the Sopranos game
[47:53.360 --> 47:55.970]  and I don't want to waste all the hoagie rolls that I bought.
[47:56.070 --> 47:58.570]  So I've been eating hoagie sandwiches every day.
[47:59.550 --> 48:01.090]  It's impacted my life.
[48:01.610 --> 48:03.290]  By the time I get that off my chest.
[48:03.590 --> 48:05.910]  By the time you get around to recording that, let's play.
[48:05.990 --> 48:07.530]  You're going to be regulation gameplay.
[48:08.090 --> 48:10.010]  You're going to be so fucking sick of hoagie sandwiches.
[48:10.090 --> 48:11.630]  You're not going to be able to eat one on video.
[48:12.510 --> 48:12.850]  It's true.
[48:13.330 --> 48:14.290]  I mean, it's a real fear.
[48:14.690 --> 48:16.290]  Thankfully, we got a little bit of a break.
[48:16.310 --> 48:20.030]  It's going to take until Sunday for this new splitter to arrive.
[48:20.350 --> 48:21.650]  And that one probably won't work.
[48:21.730 --> 48:22.710]  So I probably have to buy another one.
[48:22.910 --> 48:24.770]  What does a hoagie consist of? What is that?
[48:25.530 --> 48:26.910]  It's just a type of roll.
[48:27.070 --> 48:28.770]  It's just like a sandwich bread.
[48:29.910 --> 48:30.190]  OK.
[48:31.190 --> 48:32.790]  The hoagie itself isn't a sandwich.
[48:32.970 --> 48:36.670]  It's the term for like a sub sandwich,
[48:36.670 --> 48:41.070]  but like in Philadelphia and yeah, like that, like kind of like Northeast.
[48:41.450 --> 48:44.310]  OK, we have too many fucking names for the same sandwich in America.
[48:44.310 --> 48:46.190]  We call them grinders, hoagies.
[48:46.530 --> 48:47.450]  I've never heard grinder.
[48:48.050 --> 48:48.890]  You've never heard grinder?
[48:49.410 --> 48:51.450]  No. Yeah, it's the app I've heard of.
[48:51.550 --> 48:52.710]  Yeah. Similar. Yeah.
[48:52.730 --> 48:53.610]  But this is a sandwich.
[48:53.990 --> 48:56.450]  What you said, Gavin, is essentially what is pretzel?
[48:56.850 --> 48:58.210]  What does that consist of?
[49:00.770 --> 49:01.450]  It's true.
[49:01.850 --> 49:02.870]  But sir, go ahead, Geoff.
[49:03.230 --> 49:04.490]  What were you going to ask?
[49:04.490 --> 49:07.590]  You know how we how we always get blamed for killing people?
[49:08.470 --> 49:11.590]  And yeah, we we had a meeting today
[49:11.590 --> 49:14.750]  where it was 30 minutes of us going, did we kill that person?
[49:15.010 --> 49:16.210]  Is that someone we killed?
[49:16.530 --> 49:19.710]  Well, we're nobody lately, but we're doing
[49:19.710 --> 49:22.770]  we're doing a project, a merch project, and we needed to
[49:23.670 --> 49:27.590]  that covers a lot of different things we've done over the history of the show.
[49:27.770 --> 49:30.630]  And so we were we had a section for like an immemorial section.
[49:31.030 --> 49:32.830]  So we're trying to figure out who we did and didn't kill.
[49:32.830 --> 49:35.310]  Anyway, we always have to take credit for the bad stuff.
[49:35.430 --> 49:37.610]  But I saw this in the news the other day and I wanted to post it.
[49:37.690 --> 49:38.890]  I want to take credit for this.
[49:39.530 --> 49:43.750]  The state of California just enacted a law requiring teaching cursive writing
[49:43.750 --> 49:46.930]  in schools and 17 other states are following suit.
[49:47.350 --> 49:51.810]  I feel like because we talked about cursive or joined up writing. Boom.
[49:52.090 --> 49:53.630]  We're bringing it back. I like it.
[49:53.750 --> 49:55.610]  I'm thinking Face takes credit for cursive.
[49:55.970 --> 49:57.010]  Gavin signing in.
[49:57.790 --> 49:59.330]  Yep. Newsome that is.
[49:59.650 --> 50:03.770]  We talked about joined up writing and now California has united.
[50:04.010 --> 50:04.730]  They've joined up.
[50:05.150 --> 50:05.570]  Curse there.
[50:06.050 --> 50:09.790]  There were so many people on the subreddit that did not know like us.
[50:09.870 --> 50:14.070]  We didn't know joined up writing in cursive or like the same thing or whatever.
[50:14.290 --> 50:16.250]  And then other people had other terms for it.
[50:16.510 --> 50:20.970]  But somebody made a poll where they said, like, is it joined up writing or is it
[50:20.970 --> 50:23.870]  cursive? But they're like British, so they call it joined up writing.
[50:24.330 --> 50:27.290]  And then they were very snarky within like the first few minutes
[50:27.290 --> 50:29.430]  of like 15 people voting, it's cursive.
[50:29.490 --> 50:31.270]  And they went 15 Americans.
[50:31.410 --> 50:32.250]  You guys are wrong.
[50:33.090 --> 50:36.310]  There are so many votes and they're all for cursive.
[50:36.590 --> 50:39.310]  Yeah. Joined up writing is getting blown out of the water.
[50:39.510 --> 50:40.750]  It is great.
[50:40.850 --> 50:44.290]  I've never again, never, ever, ever had heard that term
[50:44.290 --> 50:46.710]  until we recorded that episode. Crazy.
[50:47.070 --> 50:51.890]  I also recently reading the news, you know, I saw the the whole thing
[50:51.890 --> 50:52.410]  about the cursive.
[50:52.910 --> 50:55.910]  I ran across this article and I've decided that John Carpenter,
[50:55.910 --> 50:58.050]  the director, is my fucking spirit animal.
[50:58.630 --> 51:02.350]  Legendary horror director John Carpenter just wants to play video games,
[51:02.490 --> 51:04.590]  watch basketball and eat popsicles.
[51:05.330 --> 51:06.790]  I'm not a master of anything, he says.
[51:06.830 --> 51:08.150]  I agree. I'm not a master of anything either.
[51:08.410 --> 51:10.210]  That's literally all I want to do in life.
[51:10.470 --> 51:14.190]  Maybe bicycle, but mostly video games, basketball.
[51:14.410 --> 51:17.330]  And I had to stop eating popsicles cold turkey because I was eating.
[51:17.730 --> 51:18.670]  It was all I was eating.
[51:18.790 --> 51:20.570]  Do you remember my banana popsicle phase?
[51:20.650 --> 51:21.590]  Yes. Oh, my God.
[51:22.910 --> 51:27.710]  I fucking I love that the guy who made Halloween and the thing
[51:28.190 --> 51:32.670]  just wants to fucking eat popsicles and watch the basketball players or watch.
[51:32.790 --> 51:36.290]  What? Just wants to eat my fucking mind.
[51:36.410 --> 51:38.670]  He just wants to eat popsicles and watch basketball.
[51:39.150 --> 51:40.030]  So me too.
[51:40.370 --> 51:41.970]  Was there ever a thing video game?
[51:42.610 --> 51:44.350]  Yes, there was. Yeah, I was talking about it.
[51:44.410 --> 51:45.930]  Oh, I talked about it recently.
[51:46.390 --> 51:47.870]  Oh, on this? I've never played it.
[51:47.930 --> 51:49.250]  I've always wanted to play it.
[51:49.410 --> 51:50.270]  Well, I think I might have.
[51:50.270 --> 51:51.930]  I think it's on PlayStation.
[51:52.190 --> 51:56.930]  I think I talked about it yesterday in the Alan Wake two video we made
[51:56.930 --> 52:00.970]  because I just watched the ending of it because it was on Reddit
[52:00.970 --> 52:05.170]  and it's supposedly canonical and it adds to the story from the movie.
[52:05.670 --> 52:08.470]  And I guess John Carpenter signed off on that and said, yeah, this is canon.
[52:08.690 --> 52:11.050]  And so I was watching the like the final cutscene of the game.
[52:11.470 --> 52:15.470]  And we were having a conversation about how like how poorly written video games
[52:15.470 --> 52:16.370]  used to be, essentially.
[52:16.730 --> 52:18.590]  And it definitely falls into that category.
[52:20.590 --> 52:21.950]  I'll maybe order that.
[52:22.090 --> 52:25.010]  Maybe we'll play that because it's something I've always wanted to try
[52:25.010 --> 52:28.590]  because the thing is one of my favorite movies of all time.
[52:28.690 --> 52:30.910]  Oh, I like horror. It's in my top five.
[52:31.090 --> 52:32.250]  Have you ever seen the original?
[52:32.530 --> 52:33.390]  The original black and white version?
[52:33.610 --> 52:34.290]  No, I haven't.
[52:34.490 --> 52:35.790]  So good. It's so good.
[52:35.850 --> 52:39.290]  It's not as good as the John Carpenter version, but they're both very, very good.
[52:39.490 --> 52:40.470]  I love John Carpenter.
[52:40.810 --> 52:42.030]  He's such a great director.
[52:42.190 --> 52:43.750]  I love the keyboard scores.
[52:43.750 --> 52:45.250]  I love him going nuts on the keyboard.
[52:45.850 --> 52:47.410]  I saw a clip of him today
[52:48.130 --> 52:51.510]  where he was at like some convention and somebody asked him,
[52:51.750 --> 52:55.310]  this kid asked what how he felt about the Halloween sequels
[52:55.310 --> 52:56.850]  and which one was his favorite.
[52:57.210 --> 53:00.250]  And his response was, I made the original.
[53:00.470 --> 53:02.150]  That's the only Halloween I care about.
[53:02.270 --> 53:03.790]  I don't care about the other sequels.
[53:03.870 --> 53:07.490]  The only thing I care about with them is the checks coming in.
[53:07.770 --> 53:08.870]  That's all I care about.
[53:08.930 --> 53:10.530]  And I hate to be that way, but it's true.
[53:10.830 --> 53:14.250]  I don't give a fuck about the sentiment outside of what money
[53:14.250 --> 53:16.150]  they give me for those other movies.
[53:16.610 --> 53:17.310]  He's great.
[53:17.810 --> 53:18.850]  Gotta appreciate it.
[53:19.050 --> 53:22.410]  Are you worried that you brought him up right after you talked about killing people?
[53:22.850 --> 53:23.750]  No, no.
[53:24.170 --> 53:25.070]  Asking if you're worried.
[53:25.990 --> 53:27.710]  Why don't we now? I am bleep.
[53:27.830 --> 53:29.150]  I didn't even think about that.
[53:30.010 --> 53:31.770]  No, he's young and fine.
[53:31.930 --> 53:36.310]  And he's he's subsisting off a diet of popsicles and sitting and watching video games.
[53:36.350 --> 53:38.130]  He's not even he's not even going outside.
[53:38.190 --> 53:39.190]  He's safe. He's OK.
[53:39.390 --> 53:40.330]  He'll be he'll live forever.
[53:41.170 --> 53:43.890]  Yeah, no one ever dies from sitting indoors and playing video games.
[53:43.890 --> 53:46.210]  Too many popsicles.
[53:47.050 --> 53:48.890]  He's going to stop. He's fine.
[53:49.830 --> 53:50.910]  He's living his best life.
[53:51.250 --> 53:53.610]  8th sin and 7th, and it would just be joy.
[53:54.370 --> 53:55.710]  He was taken because of joy.
[53:55.990 --> 53:56.850]  That was the crime scene.
[53:57.610 --> 53:58.490]  Happy watching.
[53:58.810 --> 54:00.010]  I wonder what his favorite team is.
[54:00.090 --> 54:01.570]  Carpenter. Is he a New York guy?
[54:02.890 --> 54:04.310]  I don't know. That's a good question.
[54:04.990 --> 54:06.910]  John Carpenter strikes me as a New York guy.
[54:07.070 --> 54:10.550]  I assume that everybody that likes basketball just likes the Celtics like me
[54:10.550 --> 54:11.550]  until I'm proven wrong.
[54:11.550 --> 54:13.770]  So in my head, he's a big Jason Tatum.
[54:14.150 --> 54:17.090]  He's a New York guy that checks out.
[54:17.530 --> 54:19.190]  That's fine. We just beat their asses last night.
[54:19.310 --> 54:22.650]  Barely. We just beat their asses.
[54:22.730 --> 54:25.690]  Barely is not typically a combination of words you hear.
[54:26.290 --> 54:28.850]  Well, we beat their asses for the first quarter and then we barely won.
[54:29.610 --> 54:32.990]  I feel like you can only say we beat their asses barely
[54:32.990 --> 54:36.410]  when you're like in a boxing match and you won by a round.
[54:36.490 --> 54:40.870]  Like, I think that's literally the only we beat their asses, but barely.
[54:41.730 --> 54:43.710]  If you watch the game, you'd understand what I mean.
[54:43.990 --> 54:45.870]  I didn't. I missed it, unfortunately.
[54:47.030 --> 54:49.210]  I was too busy making my PS3 not work.
[54:50.530 --> 54:54.590]  You know how we always talk about how great it is to run into regulation
[54:54.590 --> 54:57.590]  listeners and comment leavers in the wild because they're just like,
[54:57.710 --> 55:01.030]  we speak the same language and there's like a kinship there.
[55:01.710 --> 55:05.270]  I had maybe the whatever the opposite of that is the other night.
[55:05.450 --> 55:09.230]  I went to, you guys know I'm a big Clown Corps fan, right?
[55:09.290 --> 55:10.770]  I've talked about them in the past. Yes.
[55:10.770 --> 55:13.530]  And so they played a show in Austin, which was kind of a big deal
[55:13.530 --> 55:15.250]  because they never, ever play.
[55:15.910 --> 55:22.190]  And so Antonio and Burndog, my trucking buddies, they they wanted to go.
[55:22.310 --> 55:23.830]  They're the one they're how I found out about Clown Corps.
[55:23.830 --> 55:26.550]  Oh, my God. And Antonio got us on the guest list.
[55:27.050 --> 55:29.690]  And so he got us like behind stage and everything.
[55:29.790 --> 55:32.570]  So we got to watch like from the side. Fucking phenomenal show.
[55:32.630 --> 55:37.050]  First off, they actually build a porta potty
[55:37.050 --> 55:40.170]  and the porta potty comes out on stage and then they just start playing
[55:40.170 --> 55:43.270]  from the porta potty and then the walls fall off the porta potty
[55:43.270 --> 55:45.130]  through as slowly as the show goes on.
[55:46.590 --> 55:47.390]  Absolute insanity.
[55:48.530 --> 55:50.030]  But just a phenomenal show.
[55:50.110 --> 55:52.130]  If they ever come to your town, I highly recommend you see them play.
[55:52.290 --> 55:54.050]  And a lot of dicks. Oh, my God.
[55:54.070 --> 55:55.610]  They have like visuals in the background.
[55:55.750 --> 55:58.430]  They're like playing visuals through all the songs.
[55:58.490 --> 56:02.550]  And it's just so many wieners just morphing into other wieners and stuff.
[56:02.610 --> 56:03.210]  It's really weird.
[56:03.450 --> 56:05.870]  It's like CG wieners or like someone's film stuff.
[56:06.210 --> 56:10.010]  Like porn wieners, but that have been like like, I don't know,
[56:10.010 --> 56:14.810]  like stretched and and repeated and just like fucked with.
[56:15.670 --> 56:20.510]  It's like a multimedia experience and just a really awesome show.
[56:20.630 --> 56:25.610]  But I ran into, I shit you not, maybe 15 people came up to me
[56:25.610 --> 56:28.430]  independently of each other last night to tell me they were
[56:28.430 --> 56:29.730]  they loved Achievement Hunter.
[56:29.890 --> 56:31.310]  And I was like, cool, man. Thank you so much.
[56:31.390 --> 56:33.410]  And I asked every one of them about F*** Face
[56:33.410 --> 56:36.090]  and every one of them was like, I don't really like podcasts much.
[56:36.410 --> 56:37.910]  So we got to figure out how to...
[56:37.910 --> 56:41.510]  If you know an old Achievement Hunter fan that doesn't listen to this podcast,
[56:42.150 --> 56:44.030]  you got to convince them to give it a try.
[56:44.270 --> 56:46.530]  I like I was telling people like, well, you liked
[56:46.890 --> 56:49.850]  you liked like the 10 years of videos I made for you in video games.
[56:49.970 --> 56:51.110]  Maybe you should try this.
[56:51.190 --> 56:52.770]  And they were like, no, I'm good, man.
[56:53.090 --> 56:54.790]  I'm OK. I'm not really a podcast guy.
[56:54.870 --> 56:55.750]  Anyway, it was nice to meet you.
[56:56.290 --> 56:57.510]  And it was nice to meet them all.
[56:57.930 --> 56:59.270]  But man, I kind of get what they mean, though.
[56:59.290 --> 57:01.570]  I don't think you could talk me into listening to a podcast.
[57:02.290 --> 57:05.350]  I you don't think if I don't know. OK, how about this?
[57:05.350 --> 57:08.050]  Like how does a podcast made by people I know a lot?
[57:08.590 --> 57:10.790]  Say you're at an airport and you walk up to Edgar Wright
[57:10.790 --> 57:12.590]  and he's wiping piss off his forehead.
[57:13.510 --> 57:16.090]  And he goes, oh, hey, Gavin from Slow Mo Guys.
[57:16.290 --> 57:18.330]  And you go, yeah, that's me, Gavin from Slow Mo Guys.
[57:18.510 --> 57:20.870]  And he's like, oh, man, it's fucking great to meet you.
[57:20.890 --> 57:21.810]  I'm a big fan. And you're like, thanks.
[57:22.190 --> 57:23.990]  And he's like and you're like, I'm a big fan of your work.
[57:24.010 --> 57:25.650]  And he goes, oh, really? I really appreciate that.
[57:25.690 --> 57:26.690]  You know, I started a podcast.
[57:26.810 --> 57:28.270]  I think it's the best thing I've ever done.
[57:28.470 --> 57:30.490]  Way better than all those movies I made.
[57:30.570 --> 57:31.450]  You should give it a try.
[57:31.510 --> 57:32.910]  And you go, I don't think so, Edgar Wright.
[57:32.970 --> 57:33.670]  Anyway, have a good day.
[57:33.670 --> 57:35.510]  Now, you're right. I would listen to that.
[57:35.830 --> 57:38.410]  Yeah, you'd be like, holy shit, Edgar Wright just recommended something to me.
[57:38.490 --> 57:40.310]  I'm not comparing us to Edgar Wright, obviously.
[57:41.050 --> 57:45.130]  The only reason I even brought him up is because Gavin's nephew pissed all over him.
[57:45.890 --> 57:47.770]  No, not confirmed. Allegedly.
[57:48.530 --> 57:50.810]  Allegedly pissed. Allegedly pissed all over him.
[57:51.190 --> 57:52.410]  Probably not. Hopefully not.
[57:53.150 --> 57:56.490]  Anyway, I'm just always surprised by the intransigence to podcasting
[57:56.490 --> 57:57.570]  in general in the wild.
[57:57.690 --> 58:01.170]  And clearly those people will never hear this because it's on a podcast
[58:01.170 --> 58:02.850]  and I'm only speaking to the converted.
[58:02.850 --> 58:06.070]  But I just I wonder how we break through that.
[58:06.730 --> 58:10.230]  Do you have any other like events you're going to in the next week?
[58:10.450 --> 58:11.190]  Do you have anything planned?
[58:11.790 --> 58:12.950]  No, nothing.
[58:13.070 --> 58:16.190]  I think it's I wish the concert was tonight because that conversation
[58:16.190 --> 58:19.650]  is so much funnier if you're trying to be like, yeah,
[58:19.670 --> 58:21.910]  I'm getting my asshole waxed next week with Gavin.
[58:22.010 --> 58:23.090]  He thinks it's going to be great.
[58:23.410 --> 58:23.990]  It's true.
[58:25.330 --> 58:27.150]  Maybe that's how I should have approached it.
[58:27.170 --> 58:29.990]  I think that that would get me to listen.
[58:30.810 --> 58:33.890]  At least me personally, I want to hear what that is.
[58:35.130 --> 58:38.030]  You know, the MGM logo, you know, the line, we're going to do that,
[58:38.030 --> 58:41.110]  but with our assholes, but Gavin thinks is going to be great.
[58:41.250 --> 58:42.590]  He thinks it's going to be a great time.
[58:42.870 --> 58:46.830]  Gavin's is going to be a rainbow going across the screen covering his face.
[58:48.290 --> 58:49.010]  Just joy.
[58:49.270 --> 58:51.950]  Do we just need like a is it too hard for people to find?
[58:52.450 --> 58:54.610]  But what if we just had little QR codes
[58:55.130 --> 58:58.070]  and we just made people come up to us scattered?
[58:58.070 --> 58:59.710]  I'd be like, look, trust me, trust me.
[58:59.770 --> 59:01.110]  Oh, that's Geoff.
[59:01.230 --> 59:05.630]  You need to get a tattoo that subscribes if they put the QR code
[59:05.630 --> 59:08.410]  and then you have to pressure people into subscribing on this.
[59:08.510 --> 59:11.030]  That's that's yeah, that's what I was saying a couple of months ago
[59:11.810 --> 59:15.590]  when I was I was getting the Wilford Brimley thing wrong
[59:15.590 --> 59:18.370]  is that we should have business cards that we can hand out to people
[59:18.370 --> 59:19.370]  that are just QR codes.
[59:19.670 --> 59:21.690]  I think it's funnier to be like just to on you.
[59:22.050 --> 59:23.750]  And you've got I mean, it's a space issue.
[59:23.750 --> 59:27.190]  I know, but I don't want to get a QR code.
[59:28.030 --> 59:31.850]  Now, whatever happened to you have so many tattoos, it doesn't even matter anymore.
[59:31.930 --> 59:33.110]  You can just put whatever you want.
[59:33.350 --> 59:35.870]  I think you'd get judgment if you had a QR code.
[59:35.970 --> 59:39.210]  I also if I get a QR code, I feel like it takes away from the episode
[59:39.210 --> 59:40.450]  100 tattoos that I got.
[59:40.710 --> 59:42.470]  OK, because that was like an on camera thing.
[59:42.570 --> 59:44.190]  I sent I posted a video.
[59:44.490 --> 59:46.410]  You don't have to watch it right now or anything unless you want to.
[59:46.450 --> 59:48.450]  But I posted like a little 30 second video from the show
[59:48.850 --> 59:50.690]  right when I got there, right as they were going on.
[59:50.830 --> 59:52.270]  Oh, are there going to be schlongs in this?
[59:52.590 --> 59:53.770]  Oh, I don't think so.
[59:53.790 --> 59:55.350]  I think the wieners showed up later.
[59:55.350 --> 59:56.650]  That's that's cool.
[59:56.750 --> 59:58.590]  There's so many people that knew of you there.
[59:58.910 --> 59:59.930]  Oh, yeah, it was sold out.
[59:59.990 --> 01:00:01.110]  And there were a ton of people there in general.
[01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.230]  I mean, they're a big they're a pretty big band, I guess.
[01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:05.570]  I think they got started on TikTok.
[01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:09.670]  And so laughing at the video.
[01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:12.210]  Yeah, what's going on?
[01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:14.890]  That's John from our I.T.
[01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:19.070]  department was there also just independent of you.
[01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:21.170]  And he had such a great time.
[01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:22.210]  He loves this shit.
[01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.810]  Like he's a musician and he's just like,
[01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:26.730]  these guys rip. He loves it.
[01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:27.670]  So it's good.
[01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:30.890]  Well, first first off, it's just two dudes and they are apparently
[01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:35.630]  classically trained jazz musicians, and they're both very, very talented.
[01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:38.030]  And I guess they're in a jazz band that has nothing to do with this.
[01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:39.690]  But yeah, it is weird.
[01:00:40.110 --> 01:00:41.670]  It's weird in all the best ways.
[01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:43.390]  And it's just like you watch it and you go like,
[01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:47.230]  I'm glad there's somebody out there making something that off the wall.
[01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:48.510]  I'm glad this exists.
[01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:50.050]  It's unlike anything else.
[01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:51.170]  And I appreciate it. You know?
[01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:52.230]  I don't know.
[01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:54.390]  Did you guys start on the on the chair letter?
[01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:57.930]  No, I was going to give an update on that and say I haven't got any replies yet.
[01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:59.830]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:02.530]  I had some homework to do a couple of different things,
[01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:03.730]  and the chair letter was one of them.
[01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.190]  And I just never got around to writing it.
[01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:07.410]  And we need to do that at some point.
[01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:11.470]  We also need to write our smut, our smut scene for the
[01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:13.330]  Clutch My Pearls podcast.
[01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:15.330]  Can we talk about that real quick? Yeah.
[01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:20.190]  When we when it was pitched,
[01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.610]  I didn't think that it was going to be.
[01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:26.070]  Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.
[01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:27.770]  I didn't think it was going to be straight.
[01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.990]  You thought it'd be gay?
[01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:35.250]  That was all like that was the feeling that I had when everyone was talking.
[01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:36.610]  Yes. Yes.
[01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:38.870]  When we were doing ours. Yes. Yeah.
[01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:40.330]  OK, so it wasn't just me.
[01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:41.390]  Andrew, you felt the same way?
[01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:43.250]  So we're doing gay smut?
[01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:45.050]  You can do whatever you want.
[01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:47.810]  I'm just telling you how it felt when you were describing it.
[01:01:47.810 --> 01:01:49.190]  Oh, I didn't get that vibe at all.
[01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:50.130]  Really?
[01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:53.450]  I'm happy to do gay smut.
[01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:57.070]  Just I mean, I'm just as happy to do gay smut as straight smut.
[01:01:57.370 --> 01:01:59.610]  I think I'd be worse at writing gay smut.
[01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:02.050]  I don't think you'd be great at either.
[01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:04.190]  But I think it's just funnier if we...
[01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:08.710]  What if we got more experienced with straight smut?
[01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:12.790]  And I don't want you to source your experience when we're writing smut.
[01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:13.790]  That sounds terrible.
[01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:14.590]  How am I going to write?
[01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:17.170]  They'll be like, say, make alien smut.
[01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:18.630]  Oh, yeah. You know what? That's right.
[01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:22.510]  They use their they use their real life experience when they wrote Jurassic Park
[01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:23.610]  and Independence Day.
[01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:27.450]  You have to you have to have a personal pull to the material you're writing.
[01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:28.430]  What are you talking about?
[01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:31.870]  Both. What if it's like because the way in my head we talked about it,
[01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:34.510]  it was like a hot Southern dude from Alabama.
[01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:38.690]  That's me. And then like a saucy British princess.
[01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:39.370]  That's Gavin.
[01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:41.790]  I imagine him being a British dude.
[01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:44.250]  Yeah. And again, nothing that you've described
[01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:46.930]  makes me think it's not what I originally thought that it was.
[01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:49.870]  Right. What if what if we throw an alien in the mix?
[01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:52.050]  I don't want. I'm out.
[01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:54.230]  It's like a hot. No, I'm done.
[01:02:54.490 --> 01:02:55.930]  I'm stepping away from this project.
[01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:58.710]  What if it's a vampire werewolf?
[01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:01.030]  Does that get you back in?
[01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:05.510]  No, I think I think I'm just I'm stepping away due to creative differences.
[01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:07.950]  But we can solve those differences here.
[01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:12.570]  What if it's an unknown, undiscovered new species called a glosage?
[01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:14.130]  Yeah, I know. I'm staying out.
[01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:16.010]  I'm I'm good.
[01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:22.610]  Interesting, and what what if a glosage has a boy and a girl at the same time?
[01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:25.350]  And so it's really two people in one.
[01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:28.530]  And so the the hot southern dude can bang the glosage
[01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:33.250]  while the glosage is also having sex with the saucy British Gavin.
[01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:36.230]  Yeah. And on his back, it has like six poimals.
[01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:40.710]  I'm with Andrew that I'm also
[01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:43.690]  and my vision was Mr.
[01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:47.110]  Darcy hooks up with Mater from Cars is like personality.
[01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:50.310]  That was pretty much what I thought, too. Yeah, that was about it.
[01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:51.930]  Well, now that's not bad either.
[01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:53.510]  Gavin, how do you feel about that? Mr.
[01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:57.690]  Darcy hooks up with with Mater from Cars.
[01:03:58.070 --> 01:04:01.210]  So it's the thing that we have to all agree on on the same spot.
[01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:04.370]  No, no, you guys are writing it.
[01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:06.270]  We're just giving you a perspective.
[01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:08.310]  But so it's just one story, though.
[01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:10.370]  I think it's just one scene.
[01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:11.670]  OK, it's just like one.
[01:04:11.830 --> 01:04:14.990]  It has to be some agreement because otherwise my glosage is going to be a bit
[01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:19.770]  place. I will also say I've now listened to two episode of clutch my pearls
[01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.430]  and it's I feel out of my depth.
[01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:25.170]  I've now I've been exposed to more content of this type,
[01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:26.850]  and I don't think I have it in me.
[01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:27.950]  I don't think I could do this.
[01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:31.390]  I'm on the sideline with Eric, so it's not even creative.
[01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:32.530]  I just personally think.
[01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:35.790]  OK, so if you two are bowing out, then Gavin, you and I are free to go.
[01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:37.870]  We're going to glosage all over this thing.
[01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:40.850]  I'm excited to see what you guys do with the glosages.
[01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:43.810]  And what are the things on the back called again?
[01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:44.590]  The six of them?
[01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:45.590]  Yeah, there's poimals.
[01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:47.450]  Poimals. OK.
[01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:48.670]  I can't wait.
[01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:51.330]  I can't wait to write about the glistening poimals
[01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:56.110]  as they pulsate with the the the rhythmic thrust.
[01:04:56.570 --> 01:05:00.470]  I've never understood when when you see that people left for creative
[01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:01.710]  differences and stuff.
[01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:05.450]  But now the first time I've seen it, now I've experienced it.
[01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:06.270]  I totally get it.
[01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:09.950]  I'm excited for you guys to do this.
[01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:12.230]  Could you do the chair letter first, please?
[01:05:12.350 --> 01:05:16.530]  Because I'm I'm having to do scheduled push breaks in my days.
[01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:19.510]  What if the chair letter is a part of this?
[01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:22.950]  No, no.
[01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:25.090]  What if it's a smutty little chair?
[01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:28.010]  No, you're never going to get a chair, Andrew.
[01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:30.030]  They're two separate ideas.
[01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:31.590]  OK, these are very different.
[01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:32.830]  And I support both.
[01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:35.530]  So so what's happening to your ass throughout the day?
[01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:39.810]  It just it it really gets sore after about 45 minutes.
[01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:41.230]  And so I tough it through.
[01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:44.410]  But the bit that your ass touches is the only bit that's still there.
[01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:48.410]  Yeah, but it's just not a lot of support in the cushion sucks.
[01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:52.330]  I'd say that the bottom, the ass cushion was the worst part of the chair.
[01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:54.930]  And it's all the chair that is at this right.
[01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:58.850]  And when you have a back, you're releasing, putting some of that pressure
[01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:01.190]  on the back of the chair and relieving your butt from it.
[01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:04.270]  So now it's just pure, just pure hard butt down.
[01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:06.250]  It's just all butt down.
[01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:10.350]  And I it really I genuinely am taking tush bricks.
[01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:12.350]  I'm I'm getting up. I'm laying down.
[01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:13.830]  I'm stretching out for a bit.
[01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:15.510]  It's very unpleasant.
[01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:19.070]  You might want to consider waxing your butthole to make it more dynamic.
[01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:21.030]  Might be. I don't think so.
[01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:24.350]  Should we get you a little tush timer, like a little hourglass?
[01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:26.870]  I it would be perfect, I think.
[01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:28.810]  Yeah, I think two hourglasses.
[01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:30.950]  And then I need the I need to rest.
[01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:33.750]  Do you know those little egg timers that are like little eggs?
[01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:37.150]  I have one that's a penguin over here on my desk somewhere that like count down
[01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:41.250]  from, you know, you spin it, it counts down from an hour or ten minutes or whatever.
[01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:46.790]  Should we make a should we make little Andrew's butt timers that tell you every hour?
[01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:48.270]  It's like it's Andrew's butt cheeks.
[01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:50.130]  And it tells you every hour, dings.
[01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:52.170]  It's time to get up and massage your butt.
[01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:55.870]  Move around. I think what we should do is write a letter to the chair company.
[01:06:56.090 --> 01:06:56.650]  We could do that too.
[01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:57.830]  OK, that's what I think.
[01:06:58.230 --> 01:07:01.050]  I'm going to be leaving that due to creative differences.
[01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:07.870]  I already I texted Geoff for the weekend and said, would you mind just doing this?
[01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:09.650]  Because I know it was said as a collaborative effort.
[01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:12.190]  But Eric and Gavin are not writing this.
[01:07:12.590 --> 01:07:15.350]  It's just I was the one trying to get Geoff to do it this week.
[01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:17.910]  Right. And now I appreciate it.
[01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:19.050]  Montana, I can do it.
[01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:21.890]  I said you're leaving due to creative differences.
[01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:23.110]  Are you back on? I'm back.
[01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:24.930]  He's back on. He's back on. He's back on.
[01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:29.610]  OK. Hey, Gav, thanks for being the only one brave enough to write this stuff with me.
[01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:32.470]  It's not even a courage thing.
[01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:36.390]  I think I would hold you guys back and I want it to be the best smut project.
[01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:37.670]  That's such a cop out.
[01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:39.170]  No, it's true.
[01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:40.490]  And it's an honest thing.
[01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:41.670]  I'm serious.
[01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:43.610]  All right. We need to wrap up now.
[01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:45.330]  This is that that has to be.
[01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:46.270]  That has to be it.
[01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:49.150]  Wait one second. Let me get let me get into my mind place.
[01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:49.530]  One sec.
[01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:53.830]  No, I'm not capable of writing smut.
[01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:54.950]  I'm not. That's not for me.
[01:07:55.410 --> 01:07:57.530]  Well, if you checked your mind place, I did.
[01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:00.930]  What is that coming out?
[01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:01.970]  What is the Alan?
[01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:05.030]  I said as soon as the edit that they're currently on, I asked for them to
[01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:07.730]  prioritize that one release as soon as possible.
[01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:10.550]  Great. Half of that game is some lady in her mind place.
[01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:12.470]  Really fucking. It's that game is so good.
[01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:16.150]  I went back and I replayed sections of it because I wanted to take my time.
[01:08:16.230 --> 01:08:21.070]  I also I just need to, even though like I've been around for so long,
[01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:24.130]  the actual let's play stuff is still new to me.
[01:08:24.490 --> 01:08:29.510]  I am so used to like I'm not used to having there be an editor for content like that.
[01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:32.910]  So I need to like, remember, I'm kind of rushing when I'm playing
[01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:36.830]  and I just need to remember like, no, it's somebody is going to take
[01:08:37.350 --> 01:08:40.670]  the best parts of this out and I need to be willing to explore.
[01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:42.730]  So it's a little bit of a learning process for me
[01:08:42.730 --> 01:08:45.790]  because it's a completely different way to play a game.
[01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:48.630]  You're not going to take a piss once in a let's play it.
[01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:50.710]  You just filled the time.
[01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:54.790]  Gavin left for like three minutes.
[01:08:54.790 --> 01:08:59.310]  And then, yeah, I filled the entire time with content.
[01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:01.630]  And then I realized, like, I don't need to do this.
[01:09:01.730 --> 01:09:05.110]  In fact, Gavin brought up the point the editor would probably hate that
[01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:08.310]  because like it's hard to tell on the sound form or whatever,
[01:09:08.790 --> 01:09:10.190]  but that is the cuttable section.
[01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:13.190]  Yeah, when I would edit let's plays, any like blank area of waveform
[01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:15.790]  is usually signified some sort of break.
[01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:17.490]  And I would just go snip and it's done.
[01:09:18.150 --> 01:09:22.290]  My dumb, anxious ass is just filling for three minutes by myself
[01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:23.410]  talking without pause.
[01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:27.930]  It's the best editing trick where you convince yourself you've done work.
[01:09:28.050 --> 01:09:30.350]  Like I just edited two episodes of So All Right today,
[01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:34.370]  and they start at like an hour and 10 minutes and then they go down to 20 minutes.
[01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:38.270]  And most of that is me cutting seven minute chunks out where I'm just
[01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:40.290]  you can just hear me typing in the background, you know?
[01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:42.470]  Yeah. And every time I do it, I'm like, edit done.
[01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:43.790]  Just made of 10 minutes shorter.
[01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:45.570]  All I'm doing is eliminating silence.
[01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:48.290]  But in my head, I'm like, good job, Geoff. You did. Yeah.
[01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:49.030]  That's great.
[01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:53.730]  Speaking of silence, we should wrap this up.
[01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:55.670]  Yeah, I better go and wash my arsehole.
[01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:57.330]  Yeah. Yeah. You better get it squeaky clean, buddy.
[01:09:57.330 --> 01:09:58.510]  We need to look into these skits.
[01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:59.170]  Yep.
[01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:03.630]  I wonder if this is going to I wonder if this is going to affect my diverticulitis in any way.
[01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.670]  Oh, my God.
[01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:07.370]  Do the outro and we'll start looking into it.
[01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:11.490]  Hey, thanks for listening to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:13.410]  Hopefully you had a good time.
[01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:14.850]  Hopefully you liked it a lot.
[01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:16.330]  Hopefully you liked it so much
[01:10:16.330 --> 01:10:18.310]  that you're going to go to one of your friends
[01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:22.270]  who only watches people play video games on the Internet and say,
[01:10:22.650 --> 01:10:24.910]  hey, that's cool and all, but let's screw up a little bit.
[01:10:25.290 --> 01:10:26.390]  Let's watch. Let's listen.
[01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:27.590]  Let's do some theater of the mind.
[01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:28.870]  Let's hear some people talk.
[01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:30.110]  How about a F*** Face?
[01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:34.610]  Also, if you don't want if you don't want to grow up and be theater of the mind,
[01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:36.670]  we make video game content now.
[01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:37.970]  You can watch Let's Play.
[01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:39.210]  Do that, too.
[01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:41.390]  But most mostly do this.
[01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:43.850]  Go, huh? And then listen.
[01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:44.850]  Bye.
[01:10:46.330 --> 01:10:49.710]  Major League fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:51.230]  Can we make the perfect beanie?
[01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:52.690]  Gavin dongs again.
[01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:55.150]  And it is the question and it is the answer.
[01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:56.510]  Wait, who got waxed?
[01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:58.530]  Go to the happy baby yoga pose.
[01:10:58.830 --> 01:11:00.790]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:03.830]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
