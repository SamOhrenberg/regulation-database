[00:09.760 --> 00:12.340]  Are we getting Andrew Pantin today or are we getting Johnny Caviar?
[00:12.480 --> 00:14.060]  Oh, you're getting Andrew Pantin.
[00:14.420 --> 00:14.840]  Okay.
[00:15.040 --> 00:16.840]  It's a lot. You're gonna be getting a lot.
[00:17.640 --> 00:21.280]  You're getting Andrew Pantin and it's gonna be a lot? Is that what you said?
[00:21.660 --> 00:22.040]  Mm-hmm.
[00:22.640 --> 00:23.620]  What does that mean?
[00:23.960 --> 00:24.900]  Dude, I...
[00:24.900 --> 00:25.520]  What the fuck?
[00:25.520 --> 00:26.020]  Eric knows.
[00:26.420 --> 00:27.840]  Are you mad at me?
[00:28.340 --> 00:30.880]  No, not at all. You'll see. Eric knows.
[00:31.300 --> 00:32.980]  Okay, I wrote your letter.
[00:33.720 --> 00:35.320]  I'm excited to see it.
[00:35.980 --> 00:36.980]  Yeah, well, you'll hear it.
[00:36.980 --> 00:39.900]  Oh, I forgot that that was... I forgot about this.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.100]  Gracie asked me earlier of like, hey, did Andrew talk to you about the thing?
[00:44.260 --> 00:46.200]  And I said, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
[00:46.360 --> 00:47.100]  Now I remember.
[00:47.320 --> 00:49.160]  Now I remember what you're talking about.
[00:49.380 --> 00:51.320]  This is... we're getting... yeah, we're getting Andrew Pantin today.
[00:51.800 --> 00:52.760]  It's the chair letter.
[00:53.160 --> 00:55.600]  I like that you asked if he was mad at you. I thought that was cool.
[00:55.820 --> 00:56.020]  Yeah.
[00:56.440 --> 00:57.380]  Well, I just never know.
[00:57.580 --> 01:00.280]  I don't know if I may have done something inadvertently to anger Andrew.
[01:01.320 --> 01:02.560]  Is he... what?
[01:02.880 --> 01:03.020]  What?
[01:04.120 --> 01:05.380]  I'm just checking in, man.
[01:05.380 --> 01:06.700]  I care about his feelings.
[01:08.420 --> 01:09.920]  I care about your feelings, Geoff.
[01:10.240 --> 01:12.060]  I know you do, Andrew, and I really appreciate that.
[01:12.120 --> 01:14.780]  That's why I think this relationship works as well as it is.
[01:14.860 --> 01:17.140]  And I hope you won't listen to the detractors like Eric.
[01:18.020 --> 01:18.380]  Detractors?
[01:19.160 --> 01:21.460]  Is Detractors with Eric another podcast you have?
[01:22.320 --> 01:22.680]  Detractors...
[01:22.680 --> 01:25.600]  All right, see, now I feel like... I feel like I'm talking to Johnny Caviar all of a sudden.
[01:25.660 --> 01:28.140]  No, it's just a little joke. Just a little hee-haw.
[01:29.660 --> 01:30.840]  A little jokey caviar.
[01:31.500 --> 01:33.180]  A little jokey caviar.
[01:33.520 --> 01:34.160]  That's great.
[01:34.900 --> 01:37.140]  A little caviar comedy, as they call it.
[01:37.260 --> 01:41.300]  People seem very into this episode where you guys are combative, so it's funny.
[01:42.460 --> 01:44.800]  We can start talking about condiments again if they want combative.
[01:44.980 --> 01:45.940]  Uh-oh. No, no, no.
[01:46.060 --> 01:48.020]  No, no, I think they want a good nature.
[01:48.740 --> 01:49.120]  Oh.
[01:49.420 --> 01:50.960]  There's ten minutes on the cutting room floor, so...
[01:50.960 --> 01:52.160]  All right, and Gavin, there you go.
[01:52.780 --> 01:56.520]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:57.080 --> 02:00.740]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Gavin Free, Andrew Panton.
[02:00.740 --> 02:08.180]  This is episode 180. Hard to believe we've done this 180 times, but here we are.
[02:08.620 --> 02:09.020]  180.
[02:10.900 --> 02:12.660]  180. What a number.
[02:13.260 --> 02:14.240]  I did it like dots.
[02:14.760 --> 02:17.340]  Yeah? What do you need to do in darts to get a 180?
[02:18.220 --> 02:19.440]  Throw a triple 20 three times.
[02:20.000 --> 02:20.720]  Ah, shit.
[02:21.060 --> 02:23.520]  Dude, he had that answer locked and loaded.
[02:23.880 --> 02:24.480]  Yeah, that was good.
[02:24.480 --> 02:25.920]  He was waiting for it. Yeah, that was really good.
[02:27.340 --> 02:28.680]  Hey, we should all play some dots.
[02:29.260 --> 02:29.660]  No.
[02:33.380 --> 02:35.340]  Of course we can. Jesus Christ.
[02:35.740 --> 02:38.540]  I'm just kidding. I'm not a darts guy. I'm really bad at darts.
[02:38.880 --> 02:43.820]  Gavin, just to fill you in during the pleasantries, I had a sense. I just had a sense. I don't know why.
[02:44.540 --> 02:47.840]  But I asked Andrew, are we getting Andrew today or are we getting Johnny Caviar?
[02:47.960 --> 02:49.380]  And he goes, oh, you're definitely getting Andrew.
[02:50.040 --> 02:53.400]  You're getting a lot of Andrew. And then he started to be very Johnny Caviar.
[02:53.800 --> 02:57.300]  And so I just be forewarned. I don't know who we're dealing with today.
[02:57.300 --> 03:01.580]  Is Game Chat Andrew closer or further away to Johnny Caviar?
[03:02.940 --> 03:13.400]  I'd say closer overall. But, you know, I think what it is, it's any anger I have is being held for the PlayStation 3 and Sony as a company.
[03:13.800 --> 03:20.160]  Terrible, terrible company. My anger, my frustration has only grown and built since the last time we recorded.
[03:20.440 --> 03:23.160]  It has only gotten worse. They're terrible.
[03:23.160 --> 03:30.340]  I spent my Saturday. So I ordered one cable to try to make the PS3 record through HDMI.
[03:30.600 --> 03:37.360]  Did not work. So then I ordered another cable. It arrived on Saturday. All excited about it.
[03:37.920 --> 03:45.820]  Went down to get it and opened my door and it was a box of face merch, which is great, but not what I was expecting.
[03:46.140 --> 03:50.800]  Got the exciting Gerpler beanie we have coming out. Looks great.
[03:50.800 --> 03:56.380]  Was happy about that. Then I thought, huh, where is my cable that I ordered? It was supposed to arrive today.
[03:56.440 --> 04:01.920]  So I checked on Amazon and they said, hey, it's been delivered. And sometimes they'll hide packages.
[04:02.120 --> 04:09.360]  I thought, oh, maybe I missed it. But then I scrolled down and they took a photo of where they delivered it and they delivered it to completely the wrong door.
[04:09.500 --> 04:16.440]  Like the unit number, obviously completely different than mine. And so that was an annoyance.
[04:16.980 --> 04:17.800]  Did you have to go steal it?
[04:17.800 --> 04:22.760]  That was my plan. Yeah, I thought, well, I'll just head over there real quick and grab it.
[04:23.020 --> 04:33.200]  And so I had to enter a different section of the building. And so I had my key and I remember that my key, the fob, didn't work on it before.
[04:33.300 --> 04:39.740]  So I swapped it and I'll send my partner's key as a backup. So I left and hair was a mess.
[04:39.740 --> 04:45.580]  So I tried to throw on the Gerpler beanie, head too big. Another issue in the panting.
[04:45.580 --> 04:52.620]  Too big for a beanie? It was too big for the beanie. I couldn't get it to fit.
[04:52.980 --> 05:00.760]  My head is bigger than the Gerpler beanie, which looks great, but I need every inch a beanie can give.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.100]  And it's one of those like foldable where it says Gerpler on the front of it.
[05:05.100 --> 05:12.200]  And I thought, well, maybe I'll just tuck it down. But then I realized you could see the embroidering through the back end and it looked like shit.
[05:12.240 --> 05:17.720]  It just was a disaster. You know how they make luggage where there's like there's like the main zip.
[05:17.940 --> 05:23.960]  But then there's also like a zip that you can release the pressure with and it can like hold a little bit more.
[05:24.260 --> 05:27.900]  What if we made you a zip beanie where you unzip it and it gives you more beanie?
[05:28.400 --> 05:31.320]  Oh, I would need that. It would have been great for Saturday.
[05:32.780 --> 05:34.380]  Eric, can you check in with Tony on that?
[05:34.640 --> 05:40.660]  No, it doesn't make any sense. I'm not going to check in with Tony on that. Why wouldn't we just make a larger beanie?
[05:41.160 --> 05:44.680]  Because it's not going to fit small headed people if it's large.
[05:45.740 --> 05:49.240]  I don't care about small headed people. The small headed market has enough coverage.
[05:49.240 --> 05:51.840]  It seems like we're making this specifically for Andrew.
[05:52.540 --> 05:55.280]  No, we're making this for everyone. That's the joy of the zip.
[05:56.720 --> 05:59.280]  Gavin's right here. Think about it this way.
[06:00.640 --> 06:06.020]  We're making a beanie that services both audiences, the normal headed people and the Andrew headed people.
[06:06.260 --> 06:11.140]  If we just make a larger beanie, that only services Andrew. It doesn't help the normal headed people.
[06:11.200 --> 06:16.920]  Here we're killing two birds with one stone. You only need one beanie to service both audiences.
[06:17.020 --> 06:21.340]  What if he wants to slap his beanie on his partner if the cold has moved?
[06:21.340 --> 06:25.600]  Listen, there's a million beanies that would fit for that.
[06:26.180 --> 06:30.360]  My issue, if we're making a Gerpler beanie, it should be Gerpler sized.
[06:30.720 --> 06:36.020]  The fact that I couldn't fit the Gerpler beanie on my head felt additionally insulting.
[06:36.560 --> 06:40.580]  We even hit the crux of the problem of my story on my Saturday.
[06:41.120 --> 06:45.100]  So I got the beanie, go outside, go to get into my building.
[06:45.340 --> 06:47.920]  My key fob doesn't work. That was kind of expected.
[06:48.480 --> 06:51.900]  So then I tried the other fob. Also doesn't work.
[06:52.120 --> 06:53.980]  So now I just can't get into my building.
[06:54.240 --> 06:55.000]  You're getting fobbed off.
[06:55.300 --> 06:58.660]  Fobbed off. Yes, Gavin. Fobbed off. And I couldn't get in.
[06:59.180 --> 07:03.340]  And so I figured I'll try to call the unit that it is in front of.
[07:03.460 --> 07:05.700]  And I couldn't understand the directory system.
[07:05.880 --> 07:10.040]  So I called somebody, don't know if it was the right door, left them a message.
[07:10.460 --> 07:16.880]  Then I thought, I really want this cable because we're going to record like PS2, PS1 stuff and all this stuff.
[07:16.880 --> 07:19.880]  So I was like, I just want to get this and see if it works.
[07:19.940 --> 07:21.740]  Because if it doesn't, then I have to order another one.
[07:22.160 --> 07:24.700]  And I thought, I'll just sit outside my building.
[07:24.880 --> 07:30.860]  There's a little bench. I'll sit outside and I'll wait for somebody to either come in and come out.
[07:31.020 --> 07:33.600]  And I'll just pop in with them. It'll be fine.
[07:34.360 --> 07:39.940]  So I sat and I learned that my building on a Saturday afternoon, not a lot of traffic.
[07:39.940 --> 07:46.960]  It was like 5 Celsius and I spent an hour sitting outside my building waiting for somebody to come in or come out.
[07:47.240 --> 07:49.860]  Can somebody translate 5 Celsius into normal temperature for me?
[07:50.320 --> 07:50.720]  Pretty cold.
[07:51.280 --> 07:51.680]  Okay.
[07:52.360 --> 07:55.300]  Not freezing though, because zero is freezing in Celsius, right?
[07:55.320 --> 07:58.560]  It was cold. It was cold. I would have loved to have been able to wear the Gertler beanie.
[07:58.640 --> 08:02.980]  It would have helped. I was in my shorts, I was in my short-sleeved shirt, just freezing.
[08:03.420 --> 08:08.800]  I don't understand. Okay, wait. So you're in a short-sleeved shirt and shorts, but the thing that would have kept you warm is the beanie?
[08:08.800 --> 08:11.240]  Well, it would help. It doesn't hurt.
[08:11.780 --> 08:13.740]  You lose a lot of heat through your head and he's got a lot of head.
[08:13.740 --> 08:15.920]  You also lose it through your arms and legs.
[08:16.600 --> 08:20.760]  I can keep those next to my side. I can close off all those things. I took boat safety.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.040]  I learned the points in which you lose heat.
[08:25.160 --> 08:29.000]  When I took boat safety in grade 5, it was a mandatory class for some reason,
[08:29.560 --> 08:36.940]  I learned one of the things that stuck with me was if you're in freezing water, keep your arms and your legs together
[08:36.940 --> 08:43.560]  because the points in which you lose heat the fastest are under the armpits and between the legs.
[08:44.120 --> 08:46.100]  Now, would this be in the water or on the boat?
[08:46.720 --> 08:48.280]  This would be if you're in the water.
[08:48.600 --> 08:52.160]  Wouldn't you just go straight to the bottom of the ocean like a fucking dart?
[08:52.580 --> 08:56.360]  Well, you're supposed to have a life jacket on, I believe, is the idea.
[08:57.180 --> 08:59.160]  Also, maybe you could float on your back.
[08:59.480 --> 09:01.680]  We need a life jacket with heated armpits.
[09:01.680 --> 09:07.280]  Oh, that'd be great. Add that. Eric, send that to Tony, too. We need Tony in on that as well.
[09:07.980 --> 09:12.740]  I'm putting in the beanie thing right now. We're not going to do life jackets.
[09:12.980 --> 09:18.440]  I feel like we've moved on from jet skis in general. We're no longer a water podcast.
[09:20.080 --> 09:23.920]  Well, it's 5 degrees Celsius outside. There's no way we could be a jet ski podcast right now.
[09:23.980 --> 09:29.220]  I want it to potentially save some lives. Eric's not interested in saving lives. That's fine. We can move on. We'll go on.
[09:29.780 --> 09:31.140]  We want to add it to the list.
[09:31.140 --> 09:34.140]  During that story, I got an alert on my watch.
[09:34.340 --> 09:35.540]  You got an alert on your watch?
[09:36.460 --> 09:37.380]  Oh, I donged.
[09:37.400 --> 09:39.180]  Are you sending dongs again, dude?
[09:40.320 --> 09:41.760]  It's a one-meg dong.
[09:42.760 --> 09:44.460]  You've been writing too much smut with Geoff.
[09:45.120 --> 09:47.480]  No kidding. What do you mean, no kidding?
[09:48.280 --> 09:50.400]  Oh, that reminds me. I need to... I'll be... One sec.
[09:51.120 --> 09:52.580]  Okay, we'll see you. Take care.
[09:52.860 --> 09:54.180]  This episode's weird.
[09:54.680 --> 09:59.620]  No, I gotta plug in my wax kit. I have a wax kit. I'm gonna wax today.
[09:59.620 --> 10:00.020]  Oh!
[10:00.480 --> 10:03.720]  Yeah, cause, you know, Gavin said it would be such a joyous experience.
[10:03.820 --> 10:05.600]  We can't do it until next week, though.
[10:06.040 --> 10:06.540]  F*** me out.
[10:06.780 --> 10:10.520]  Office day. From Eric. When? September 2nd, 2022.
[10:10.840 --> 10:11.260]  Whoa!
[10:11.580 --> 10:12.920]  What the f***?
[10:13.120 --> 10:13.320]  What?
[10:13.820 --> 10:16.260]  Did I get lost in the mail or something? Like, what the hell?
[10:16.760 --> 10:17.380]  What happened?
[10:18.340 --> 10:20.620]  That just popped up, like, right now.
[10:21.120 --> 10:24.980]  Let me know if you're busy on September 2nd, last year, and we should be fine.
[10:26.460 --> 10:28.800]  426 days ago, it says.
[10:28.800 --> 10:31.240]  Yeah, Eric, how did you balls up the waxing?
[10:31.360 --> 10:32.180]  I'm sorry?
[10:32.860 --> 10:34.120]  Weren't you supposed to get that going?
[10:34.580 --> 10:36.200]  Yeah, I am getting it going.
[10:37.260 --> 10:43.600]  I've been... I've been... Hey, hey. I've been out of town. So this is how it works the other way, bud.
[10:44.780 --> 10:45.700]  Why am I bud?
[10:47.140 --> 10:48.640]  Because you're... Oh my god.
[10:51.220 --> 10:52.380]  Andrew, get back to your story.
[10:52.380 --> 10:56.160]  Yeah, no, story. I'm warm, but I'm waxing.
[10:56.600 --> 11:00.460]  Because Gavin, you said it would be such a fun experience, so I reached out to Gracie.
[11:00.480 --> 11:03.680]  Gracie was kind enough to send me a wax kit with the cart.
[11:04.440 --> 11:06.580]  And so now it's... I gotta heat it up.
[11:06.860 --> 11:11.080]  So I didn't know that you had to do that with wax. I read the instructions last night.
[11:11.260 --> 11:14.900]  I put the wax thing in. I just plugged it into an outlet.
[11:15.060 --> 11:19.380]  In about 30 minutes, the wax will have melted and I can apply it to the paper.
[11:20.240 --> 11:20.900]  Do the waxing.
[11:23.320 --> 11:26.060]  Gavin thinks this is gonna be a great time, so I'm sure this will be great.
[11:26.240 --> 11:29.140]  Gavin has never led me astray before, so this is gonna be a lot of fun.
[11:29.140 --> 11:31.160]  That's not true. That's not true. Why you say that?
[11:31.580 --> 11:36.520]  No, it's never... Every time, whenever Gavin says something's a good experience, it's always good, it's always fun.
[11:36.580 --> 11:39.360]  Whenever he says anything, it ends up being correct for the most part.
[11:40.320 --> 11:47.120]  99.9 percentile, so I'd be shocked if this waxing thing is not gonna be absolutely fantastic and fun.
[11:47.540 --> 11:48.700]  So when will we know? Half an hour?
[11:49.160 --> 11:54.920]  Yeah, half an hour. I'll have to step away and apply the wax to the paper and then apply it to myself.
[11:54.920 --> 11:55.360]  Wait, why do you have to step away?
[11:55.980 --> 12:03.360]  Because I need to... It's not easy, okay, to do this. I'm a mess. I have no idea what I'm doing. It's gonna be a disaster.
[12:03.760 --> 12:06.160]  Are you gonna be Winnie the Pooh-ing this podcast, then?
[12:06.500 --> 12:09.220]  I'm already Winnie the Pooh-ing this podcast. You're on your way.
[12:09.760 --> 12:11.640]  So your gents are on the stool?
[12:12.100 --> 12:18.420]  Uh, they are. You guys have... I mean, I don't want it to be too much. You know, you guys seem to have the ass covered.
[12:18.900 --> 12:21.820]  So I'm thinking of going the other way, is my plan.
[12:22.240 --> 12:23.480]  Which I'm sure will be fun.
[12:25.040 --> 12:26.080]  That's gonna be a great time.
[12:26.900 --> 12:31.720]  Well, you know, there's a front and a back, and so I'm thinking like...
[12:31.720 --> 12:32.900]  You're gonna do front ass?
[12:33.460 --> 12:35.040]  Uh, yeah, I think I'm gonna do front ass.
[12:35.440 --> 12:36.880]  What's that, like back of the balls?
[12:38.200 --> 12:39.520]  No, I'm thinking like upper.
[12:40.000 --> 12:40.980]  You like your dick shelf?
[12:40.980 --> 12:43.840]  Yeah, like dick shelf I think is a good way to put it.
[12:44.520 --> 12:45.840]  Wait, what's the dick shelf?
[12:47.220 --> 12:48.420]  It's above the dick.
[12:49.020 --> 12:55.720]  Technically, the dick shelf is that muscle that's just over your hips that only some dudes have, guys that work out obsessively.
[12:56.220 --> 12:59.000]  Uh, I was just referring to the, like your...
[12:59.000 --> 12:59.660]  The pube?
[12:59.980 --> 13:00.460]  Yeah.
[13:00.600 --> 13:00.800]  Pube hole?
[13:01.820 --> 13:03.080]  Yeah, the pube hole.
[13:04.240 --> 13:05.060]  Scrotum shelf.
[13:05.640 --> 13:07.840]  You know, it fits the description.
[13:08.080 --> 13:10.080]  That's the most painful part, I assume.
[13:10.080 --> 13:12.920]  No, you said it was gonna be a great time, this whole waxing thing.
[13:12.960 --> 13:14.380]  Specifically the anal area.
[13:14.900 --> 13:17.060]  Yeah, he thinks his butthole will feel good.
[13:17.600 --> 13:22.800]  You guys have the anal area covered, so I guess I'm doing advanced research on if the front is as much fun.
[13:23.200 --> 13:24.640]  It's not gonna be covered for long.
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.700]  We'll see, maybe I got really strong hair, I don't know. Maybe it'll resist.
[13:34.460 --> 13:34.820]  So...
[13:34.820 --> 13:37.720]  Wait, hang on, wait, wait, wait, hang on, I don't wanna move too far away from that.
[13:37.880 --> 13:42.920]  You think maybe you have strong hair that will resist the waxing?
[13:43.520 --> 13:49.000]  I'm, it's not likely, I'm just saying, we're in uncharted territory, we're doing research, we're gonna figure out what happens.
[13:49.100 --> 13:53.900]  So you think it's like, potentially like, unbreakable nose, unchokeable neck, uh...
[13:53.900 --> 13:54.660]  Unwaxable pubes.
[13:54.980 --> 13:56.000]  Unwaxable pubes?
[13:56.000 --> 14:04.240]  I, I'm probably not, I think that's just too many gifts for God to give anybody, not even that I believe in God, but...
[14:04.240 --> 14:10.340]  I would say that the nose and the neck is probably, I've already gotten a lot.
[14:10.720 --> 14:11.820]  I've had a lot dealt my way.
[14:11.840 --> 14:15.060]  It's true, you've already been blessed in so many ways.
[14:15.420 --> 14:19.280]  Oh god damn, I love you.
[14:19.580 --> 14:23.120]  I think I have regulation pubes, I'd assume, but we'll find out.
[14:23.740 --> 14:26.920]  Oh, that's interesting, I never thought about whether my pubes are regulation or not.
[14:28.560 --> 14:32.300]  Yeah, so in about 20 minutes...
[14:32.300 --> 14:34.180]  So we have to vamp for 20 minutes is what you're saying?
[14:34.180 --> 14:38.080]  Well no, we just do the normal show, I'm just gonna step out at a certain point, and then...
[14:38.080 --> 14:45.640]  I'll be honest, I regret booking a recording for Game Stuff right after this, I assume that's gonna be not a thing I feel like doing, but...
[14:45.640 --> 14:48.280]  Oh yeah, we're doing that Sopranos game, is that right?
[14:48.620 --> 14:52.540]  Sopranos, yeah, we've been trying to do the Sopranos for a long time, Eric's so excited about it.
[14:52.540 --> 14:55.740]  I should've prepared a plate of pasta or something.
[14:55.960 --> 15:04.300]  Yeah, I'm really excited about it, but in order to do it, Andrew needed to get a splitter, which he was in the middle of telling the story of.
[15:04.860 --> 15:05.580]  Oh, I got it.
[15:05.760 --> 15:06.040]  Did you ever get that splitter?
[15:06.300 --> 15:12.480]  I did, it took me an hour. The first person that came out of the building, they opened the door, and I said,
[15:12.480 --> 15:18.160]  Hey, and I did the anxiety thing where I over-explained the scenario, and they just looked at me and said,
[15:18.320 --> 15:25.040]  I don't have a fob. And I thought, well, that seems like a bad idea. I mean, I don't know why you wouldn't...
[15:25.040 --> 15:31.760]  I think you just don't wanna let me in, cause I got Gerpler hair, and I look like a maniac, and I'm shivering, but that's fine.
[15:31.820 --> 15:34.280]  So you just went without the beanie straight up? You didn't just squeeze it on?
[15:34.280 --> 15:41.180]  Yeah, because I thought the beanie made me look more psychotic than without the beanie, was the evaluation I had to make.
[15:41.180 --> 15:44.900]  How bad could the hair have been to the point where you were worried about that?
[15:45.160 --> 15:49.700]  No, it's just like I hadn't had a shower that day, it was just bed hair.
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.740]  His barber retired and then died, so he probably hasn't had a haircut in like four years.
[15:53.920 --> 15:57.420]  We don't know if he's dead, but he's definitely retired.
[16:00.080 --> 16:08.080]  So it took about an hour, and then eventually a nicer, older man, who I recognized some of the items he had on him, which was an icebreaker, got in...
[16:08.080 --> 16:08.980]  Did you ask him for a haircut?
[16:09.580 --> 16:15.100]  No, I didn't. He didn't... I don't know. His hair was fine. It didn't strike me as like great hair.
[16:15.900 --> 16:20.500]  Went up, grabbed the thing, snuck out, left. But that was my Saturday.
[16:21.280 --> 16:27.260]  I missed a large portion of Nagano vs. Fury because I was sitting outside my building.
[16:27.760 --> 16:28.820]  You didn't miss shit, dude.
[16:29.080 --> 16:31.980]  No, what do you mean I didn't miss shit? He dropped him in the third!
[16:32.440 --> 16:35.120]  Yeah, he did. You missed that one moment, but...
[16:35.120 --> 16:38.140]  That was one of the greatest sporting events of all time! What are you talking about?
[16:38.140 --> 16:42.780]  Disappointed in Fury in that fight, for sure. Very impressed with Nagano, though.
[16:43.820 --> 16:52.780]  Nick said, will you cut my hair, sir? I wonder, if you stood on the street, Andrew, with that hair, and just asked 100 strangers if they would cut your hair, how many do you think would say yes?
[16:53.120 --> 16:58.180]  I think if I stood on the street and offered $100 to people walking by, nobody would take it.
[16:58.300 --> 17:04.620]  There's a 0% chance that anyone is cutting my hair that I'm requesting on the street.
[17:05.620 --> 17:07.560]  I'm not charismatic in that way.
[17:07.860 --> 17:12.680]  Do you think that's just because of the people, like the pool of people, or do you think it's your hair specifically that they wouldn't want to touch?
[17:13.100 --> 17:13.560]  People pool.
[17:13.600 --> 17:21.900]  I think it's me. I think it's just me as a whole. I just don't think I'm charismatic enough to convince a random person to cut my hair.
[17:22.400 --> 17:23.600]  You've got loads of charisma!
[17:24.120 --> 17:24.440]  Yeah, you do.
[17:24.920 --> 17:26.000]  Not in that way.
[17:26.400 --> 17:28.120]  You could convince someone to wax your ass!
[17:28.600 --> 17:35.380]  Well, the fact that I'm waxing my pubes, I think, is an argument against my ability to do that, but... fine.
[17:35.600 --> 17:40.420]  If you want to give me credit for that, I'm not going to not take it, but I think there's a lot of evidence that suggests otherwise.
[17:40.960 --> 17:41.320]  Nonsense.
[17:43.060 --> 17:45.760]  So, Geoff, you've been writing some mutt, and you wrote a chair thing?
[17:45.860 --> 17:49.540]  Well, you know, we have had some homework. We all had some homework.
[17:49.540 --> 17:57.780]  Andrew, you're completely going through with your homework, obviously, and I really appreciate it by doing this pube waxing thing.
[17:58.300 --> 18:03.720]  Clearly, Gavin and I are not getting waxed right now. I guess it's because Eric didn't do his homework, which is not a judgment.
[18:03.960 --> 18:06.280]  It's not an indictment on my part. I don't care one way or the other.
[18:08.260 --> 18:14.340]  Then we also had the smut homework and writing a letter to a chair company homework.
[18:14.340 --> 18:21.380]  I want you to know I did both of those things, but before we get to it, Gavin posted a picture of his watch that he wanted everyone to see.
[18:22.500 --> 18:26.360]  He also sent me a picture of his watch that I'm going to upload for you guys.
[18:28.080 --> 18:32.800]  This is, if you can't see it, obviously, it just says, low quality sleep detected.
[18:32.980 --> 18:38.940]  What happened? Looks like your sleeping heart rate dip was lower and your sleep disruption was higher than usual.
[18:40.380 --> 18:45.440]  That's the only thing Gavin sent me the other day when I invited him to play video games with us.
[18:47.420 --> 18:54.340]  Trucks has been... I mean, you know, it's immense fun, but the next day it's like a hangover.
[18:54.780 --> 18:55.940]  I don't know how you do it.
[18:56.340 --> 18:59.820]  Dude, I played till about 1am last night. I tried to get Gavin to play trucks last night with me.
[18:59.880 --> 19:06.500]  Actually, we were playing Generation Zero, so that's teenage Swedish trucks, is what we call it.
[19:06.500 --> 19:12.560]  And Gavin just said, it's a school night. And I was like, oh fuck, it is a school night, I forgot.
[19:12.780 --> 19:18.780]  And then I felt like I was in trouble and I needed to apologize to him because it was clear I was still going to play even though he didn't.
[19:19.080 --> 19:21.340]  But then I realized I'm 48 and he can go fuck off.
[19:24.420 --> 19:31.700]  But we did play trucks one time and I think by all accounts you had a good time, right Gavin?
[19:32.240 --> 19:33.100]  I played twice.
[19:33.100 --> 19:41.480]  Twice. It's a broken piece of shit. So, Andrew, you'll love this, we switched to what we call wet trucks, which is Sea of Thieves.
[19:41.780 --> 19:42.420]  Oh, hell yeah.
[19:42.620 --> 19:45.560]  I think Gavin had the time of his life playing Sea of Thieves.
[19:45.740 --> 19:48.480]  Really? You had fun, Gavin?
[19:50.080 --> 19:53.480]  Yeah, it was really fun. I've only ever played that in videos.
[19:53.500 --> 19:53.640]  That pause.
[19:54.660 --> 19:55.720]  Oh, sorry, I was drinking some tea.
[19:55.720 --> 19:56.820]  He was drinking something, you can tell.
[19:56.820 --> 19:57.720]  Okay, yeah.
[19:59.340 --> 20:02.100]  Bad time to pour burning tea into my gullet.
[20:05.460 --> 20:09.740]  Yeah, I've only played it in videos and I've never really understood what the goal is.
[20:10.180 --> 20:13.160]  But just to kind of play casually, it's a different vibe.
[20:14.460 --> 20:19.480]  And the teamwork, Antonio was calling the shots, he was like, all the sails need to move.
[20:19.940 --> 20:24.720]  And suddenly we'd all just go and get a sail and you'd see them all turn at the same time.
[20:24.900 --> 20:25.460]  It was epic.
[20:26.220 --> 20:27.000]  Yeah, it's great.
[20:27.980 --> 20:36.360]  That game does promote teamwork and team play in a way that I guess is probably similar to Trucks and unique to those two games from what I can tell.
[20:37.220 --> 20:42.040]  But anyway, Gavin, we had the best time playing with you and we still talk about you to this day.
[20:42.780 --> 20:45.420]  Every night when we play Trucks. Last night they asked, I was like, yeah, we can't.
[20:45.420 --> 20:47.720]  That's so cute. That's so adorable.
[20:48.120 --> 20:52.220]  They have had the nicest time getting to know you and they really want to get to know Andrew too.
[20:52.780 --> 20:53.580]  So maybe we can...
[20:53.580 --> 20:56.100]  I'll do Sea Trucks, I'm very familiar with the seas.
[20:56.100 --> 20:57.700]  It's called Wet Trucks, but yeah.
[20:58.000 --> 20:59.880]  Wet Trucks, whatever. I'll figure out the terminology.
[20:59.960 --> 21:01.220]  What do you have against Bogstown and Trucks?
[21:01.980 --> 21:06.280]  I just am really, like, I've got anxiety because of how bad I am at that game.
[21:06.360 --> 21:07.420]  I need to get another...
[21:07.420 --> 21:09.080]  Yeah, but you're way better than me. We watched you play.
[21:09.380 --> 21:13.900]  No, but you got like a fancy truck or something. I don't know what's going on. You seem to have a better understanding.
[21:14.060 --> 21:18.600]  Eric can back me up on this. I spent that video in the mud, just stuck in the mud.
[21:18.900 --> 21:19.660]  That's all I did.
[21:19.820 --> 21:21.080]  I mean, you were definitely in the mud.
[21:21.620 --> 21:26.280]  That's what's supposed to happen. And you'd finished it two hours before Gavin did.
[21:26.760 --> 21:32.280]  Yeah, and the other night in Trucks, I'd been driving for about 10 minutes, thinking I was doing amazing.
[21:32.700 --> 21:36.060]  Thinking I was like, oh, I'm not getting stuck anymore. You know, my truck must be getting pretty good.
[21:38.040 --> 21:42.540]  Because I was looking to the side, I was looking over this lake, and then I turned the camera towards the front.
[21:42.780 --> 21:45.760]  And I realized Antonio had been towing me the entire time.
[21:49.620 --> 21:54.700]  I was like, oh, okay. Maybe I'm not so good.
[21:55.260 --> 21:56.680]  We laughed about that for a long time.
[21:56.680 --> 21:57.600]  Oh, that's so funny.
[21:58.460 --> 22:04.740]  Okay, so I just wanted to mention that the late night gaming has been a lot of fun, and it's thriving right now.
[22:04.840 --> 22:08.560]  And I would love to get you into the mix too, Andrew, especially on the nights when Gavin has to go to bed early.
[22:09.300 --> 22:11.120]  Okay, well, second fiddle to Gavin.
[22:11.500 --> 22:13.140]  No, no, I don't want you to be second fiddle.
[22:13.380 --> 22:15.000]  I invited you first.
[22:15.380 --> 22:15.920]  That's true.
[22:16.120 --> 22:17.120]  You're in a way better time zone.
[22:17.480 --> 22:22.220]  But let me in the... I want on the C. I'll do a C night any night. I'm there.
[22:22.400 --> 22:27.180]  Well, if you download Generation Zero, I can promise you you can get in anytime.
[22:27.180 --> 22:29.500]  I haven't played that game. I need to get my reps in before I'm...
[22:29.500 --> 22:33.060]  It's the current obsession. You really don't need to play it or know anything ahead of time.
[22:34.420 --> 22:36.600]  It's even less complicated than trucks.
[22:38.400 --> 22:41.680]  Just before we move on from games entirely, I just had a quick thing.
[22:41.980 --> 22:47.120]  I had one of the scariest non-scary moments of my life playing Alan Wake 2 the other night.
[22:47.580 --> 22:52.880]  I'm haunted by it. And I'm curious, Gavin's been playing. I wonder if he's encountered this. How far are you?
[22:52.900 --> 22:56.040]  Have you gotten past the dick guy? You fought the dick guy?
[22:56.640 --> 22:57.800]  That's exactly where I am.
[22:58.100 --> 23:05.140]  I also really love that they've paired the head of the studio's face with the voice actor for Max Payne again.
[23:05.140 --> 23:09.400]  So it's just like you're running around with your friend Max Payne. I love it so much.
[23:09.520 --> 23:16.720]  It's great. I'm hoping that because they're remastering Max Payne, I think it would be so cool if they put Max Payne in that overall universe as well.
[23:17.220 --> 23:19.360]  Like Alan Wake is now part of Control and all that.
[23:19.700 --> 23:26.780]  But anyway, I was playing Alan Wake 2 and I was in this very spooky section where I was genuinely really scared.
[23:26.880 --> 23:30.760]  I'm running around. I was in a place that was like a ranger cabin.
[23:30.760 --> 23:34.820]  And I was trying to figure out a password for the device.
[23:35.040 --> 23:37.000]  Like it's a computer that is a locked terminal.
[23:37.620 --> 23:38.740]  And so I was walking around.
[23:38.960 --> 23:40.520]  Eric and I, we made a video on Alan Wake 2.
[23:40.860 --> 23:44.860]  Eric and I, one of the dumbest moments I think I've experienced in games in a long time.
[23:45.120 --> 23:48.080]  Where we had to try to figure out how to break into a lock.
[23:48.700 --> 23:49.960]  And it had symbols on it.
[23:50.340 --> 23:53.600]  And the instructions were like, get the chicken from the fridge.
[23:53.980 --> 23:54.520]  Lay in the bed.
[23:54.720 --> 23:56.760]  Oh my god, you guys are so dumb.
[23:56.760 --> 23:59.700]  Eric and I were looking at the symbols on the lock.
[23:59.780 --> 24:04.950]  Trying to interpret which symbols like symbolized those physical actions.
[24:05.700 --> 24:06.380]  Or those things.
[24:06.660 --> 24:09.420]  Not realizing that there was a house behind us.
[24:09.480 --> 24:12.760]  And we just had to walk to the fridge and see what symbol was painted on the fridge.
[24:12.920 --> 24:15.180]  Or go to the bedroom and see what was above the bed.
[24:15.340 --> 24:22.940]  It was like, it was like you know that round like red and yellow kids toy that has all the holes cut into it for kids to learn shapes.
[24:22.940 --> 24:28.800]  It was like watching Andrew and Eric try to wedge the star shape into the rectangle hole over and over again.
[24:29.540 --> 24:33.740]  While arguing which star looks most like a chicken being pulled from a refrigerator.
[24:34.100 --> 24:34.920]  Exactly, exactly.
[24:34.920 --> 24:36.180]  It was really dumb.
[24:36.360 --> 24:39.020]  So I'm trying to figure out this password in this other cabin.
[24:39.580 --> 24:42.540]  And it's locked and I can't, I've looked around everywhere.
[24:42.860 --> 24:43.980]  I can't find anything.
[24:44.440 --> 24:51.400]  So I thought maybe I'll just like try a combination to see like how many letters or numbers or like what I'm even looking for.
[24:51.400 --> 24:57.360]  So I sat down, clicked the button and I just went 4 4 4 4 and it locked me out.
[24:57.620 --> 24:59.460]  But there showed there was like 5 or 6 symbols.
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.160]  And I thought that's weird.
[25:01.420 --> 25:03.500]  Is it because I did 4 4's in a row?
[25:03.640 --> 25:04.700]  That's why?
[25:04.780 --> 25:07.380]  And it's a combination where you can enter from 0 through 9.
[25:07.680 --> 25:12.040]  And so then I just hit in 4 other random numbers and it unlocked.
[25:12.540 --> 25:16.900]  I put the combination in on my second try just randomly guessing.
[25:17.580 --> 25:20.540]  And when it turned green I almost had a heart attack.
[25:20.540 --> 25:25.880]  Because I was convinced that it was some demon, this was some demon shit and I went to bed.
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.180]  I put the controller down and I went to sleep because I was scared.
[25:30.540 --> 25:39.920]  And I was like there's no, the odds of me just randomly deciphering a 4 number passcode on my second guess.
[25:40.300 --> 25:40.980]  Just putting stuff in.
[25:41.060 --> 25:41.920]  I clipped it.
[25:42.520 --> 25:45.240]  I'll see if I can find, I can send you the clip of me doing it.
[25:45.240 --> 25:51.200]  It's only like 10 seconds but I genuinely have never been so scared.
[25:51.600 --> 25:59.700]  And then I was just sitting in bed going like I wonder if the second password you put in no matter what will give you the correct login.
[26:00.620 --> 26:04.720]  Because there's no way, I still don't know how you're supposed to even know what the password is.
[26:04.980 --> 26:05.840]  I couldn't find it.
[26:06.140 --> 26:12.880]  So you were there trying to stuff a circle into a square but you ended up like Apollo 13ing the square to the circle with like a sock.
[26:13.020 --> 26:13.920]  And you just got it right.
[26:14.560 --> 26:15.500]  Exactly, yeah.
[26:15.960 --> 26:17.680]  That's exactly what happened.
[26:17.900 --> 26:20.360]  But it's genuinely the scariest I've ever been.
[26:20.460 --> 26:26.020]  And I know it's not like an obviously scary thing but just the odds of me being able to do that.
[26:26.320 --> 26:29.300]  I'm still convinced that it's like on your second try no matter what you get it.
[26:29.320 --> 26:33.680]  Because it just doesn't, I'd love to know what the percentages are of that actually happening.
[26:34.140 --> 26:38.200]  That was your lottery ticket moment and you spin it on a lock in a video game.
[26:38.480 --> 26:40.200]  Oh no, you're right.
[26:40.480 --> 26:41.400]  That was it.
[26:42.000 --> 26:42.880]  That was it.
[26:42.880 --> 26:44.500]  I'm never going to win anything again.
[26:44.620 --> 26:46.580]  It was an Alan Wake 2.
[26:46.680 --> 26:49.580]  And honestly the emails I unlocked for it were not all that interesting.
[26:49.720 --> 26:50.880]  I just put a link if you want to see.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.860]  That was your multi-state powerball.
[26:53.700 --> 26:54.300]  Oh my god.
[26:54.300 --> 26:54.700]  This is a clip?
[26:54.940 --> 26:56.000]  This is a clip.
[26:57.160 --> 26:59.840]  If you click it, you'll see.
[27:00.580 --> 27:01.400]  It's very brief.
[27:02.760 --> 27:06.240]  And then I just put in something else and it goes green and I thought, what?
[27:06.540 --> 27:08.040]  What do you mean? Did I do something?
[27:08.100 --> 27:09.260]  And then it pops.
[27:10.520 --> 27:14.060]  And as soon as that clip ended, controller down, I'm in my bed, terrified.
[27:14.080 --> 27:17.000]  So that's what, like a 1 in 10,000 chance?
[27:17.880 --> 27:19.100]  It has to be, right?
[27:19.300 --> 27:21.320]  Like, I don't know what the math is. Is that what it is?
[27:21.420 --> 27:23.260]  I just, I couldn't...
[27:23.260 --> 27:25.700]  I still don't understand how I was supposed to know that number.
[27:25.780 --> 27:29.760]  But I was curious if you had gotten there, Gavin, and if you had fucked with that and if you had an answer.
[27:31.540 --> 27:36.220]  If that's the actual code, that's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[27:36.980 --> 27:40.200]  Yeah, it... I'm not... I don't know. I can't explain it.
[27:40.300 --> 27:41.400]  But I was terrified.
[27:43.880 --> 27:45.100]  I'm still terrified.
[27:45.900 --> 27:47.340]  Have you still not played beyond that?
[27:47.340 --> 27:49.100]  And now I'm disappointed. Sorry, what did you say, Gavin?
[27:49.780 --> 27:51.460]  Have you still not played past that point?
[27:51.900 --> 27:54.140]  No, no, I'm done. I finished it last night.
[27:54.200 --> 27:54.320]  Okay.
[27:55.500 --> 28:03.260]  So that's on a different account or a different playthrough or save file than we're doing for the Alan White playthrough for the Let's Play channel, right?
[28:03.260 --> 28:06.560]  So we can... we'll run up against this lock again pretty soon.
[28:06.560 --> 28:07.720]  Oh, that's a great point. Yeah.
[28:07.760 --> 28:09.980]  How many pots have you done?
[28:10.400 --> 28:11.240]  We've only done one.
[28:11.600 --> 28:14.100]  If I catch up to where you are in the game, can I hop in?
[28:14.460 --> 28:15.640]  I think you're already caught up.
[28:15.800 --> 28:16.780]  You are there. We stopped.
[28:16.780 --> 28:17.880]  You actually might be ahead.
[28:19.120 --> 28:19.400]  Sick.
[28:19.500 --> 28:23.440]  We stopped when you go to the morgue in the police station.
[28:24.180 --> 28:25.600]  So you're ahead. You're one ahead.
[28:26.100 --> 28:27.140]  That's my gaming update.
[28:27.380 --> 28:30.560]  Dude, that's wild. I'm sorry about your lost winnings, though.
[28:30.560 --> 28:35.660]  Yeah, I didn't even think about it in that context, and now I'm not only scared, but disappointed.
[28:35.860 --> 28:36.740]  That sucks.
[28:37.620 --> 28:43.700]  What a lucky thing to create such terrible dual emotions for you.
[28:43.880 --> 28:44.580]  I'm so sorry.
[28:44.940 --> 28:47.700]  Hey, maybe we can turn some of your bad luck around.
[28:48.300 --> 28:48.540]  Okay.
[28:49.240 --> 28:56.940]  So, as we know, we hit September, and it's chair-busting time, and the chair busted.
[28:56.940 --> 29:05.500]  So we need to get you a new chair, and we thought about reaching out to chair manufacturers to try to see if we could get you a free chair, right?
[29:05.640 --> 29:07.180]  To test the durability of it.
[29:07.380 --> 29:09.140]  So you challenged us.
[29:09.200 --> 29:11.920]  You're a great email guy, but you said, I don't want to write the email myself.
[29:12.020 --> 29:16.320]  I'll contact every chair company on earth, which I'm going to hold you to, if you just write the email.
[29:17.300 --> 29:24.700]  We then didn't write the email, so I have done the work, and I've written an email for you today.
[29:24.780 --> 29:25.480]  I've composed an email.
[29:25.480 --> 29:26.840]  I'd like to read it to you.
[29:27.300 --> 29:28.220]  Oh, I'm so excited.
[29:28.520 --> 29:33.020]  You can take this, you can use it verbatim, you can change it around.
[29:33.240 --> 29:34.200]  Oh, I'm not going to change it.
[29:34.940 --> 29:37.520]  But here's what I've come up with, and let me know what you think.
[29:37.860 --> 29:45.840]  Dear manufacturer of fine chairs, while searching for a sturdy, reliable, comfortable, yet stylish chair, I've run across yours.
[29:45.840 --> 29:49.160]  My client is, among other things, a professional sitter.
[29:49.640 --> 29:55.940]  One who spends copious amounts of time chairing, and as such, we've yet to find a solution that can accommodate his needs.
[29:56.000 --> 29:59.620]  To put it bluntly, most chairs are not built for the professional sitter.
[30:00.060 --> 30:03.200]  They fall well short of the durability required by the medium.
[30:03.640 --> 30:09.420]  Honestly, to this point, no chair we have identified has had the stamina and structure to last longer than one year,
[30:09.740 --> 30:13.020]  before disintegrating into a mess of broken promises and disappointment.
[30:13.020 --> 30:20.800]  We need, nay, our very society needs, a durable chair that can last a minimum of three years.
[30:21.240 --> 30:31.700]  Civility demands it. My hope is that your chair can be that chair, that rock, that solid rock of sitting that he can rely on,
[30:31.860 --> 30:38.780]  day in, day out, year in, year out, the tool to enhance and accompany him on his professional journey.
[30:38.780 --> 30:44.400]  Make no mistake, he is as passionate about sitting as you are about your quality and design.
[30:44.720 --> 30:48.620]  Could these dual passions be a match? I await your response.
[30:49.600 --> 30:53.420]  I love it, Geoff. That is some masterful writing by you.
[30:53.920 --> 30:58.240]  If you could please copy and paste and send that to me, I will send it to every chair manufacturer,
[30:58.600 --> 31:02.120]  and I will give an update on any replies I give on future episodes.
[31:02.460 --> 31:06.780]  Now, one addendum to that. I wrote that as if I was your agent speaking for you.
[31:06.780 --> 31:12.680]  My recommendation is that you pull a Trump in the 80s, like he did when he pretended to be a guy named John Barron,
[31:12.720 --> 31:16.620]  and he would call up and say he was the press agent, and he would clarify things with journalists,
[31:16.680 --> 31:19.660]  but it was clearly just him pretending to be somebody else, putting on a fake voice.
[31:20.080 --> 31:23.540]  I think Johnny Caviar should be your agent, and he should send this email.
[31:24.720 --> 31:31.040]  I love this idea. I just would need a johnnycaviar at roosterteeth.com email. As long as that can be accommodated.
[31:31.560 --> 31:35.320]  I'm sure we can make that happen. Yeah, I'm sure we can sort that out. I'm sure Eric can sort that out.
[31:35.320 --> 31:37.680]  Can we also have a Johnny Caviar slack?
[31:39.880 --> 31:41.980]  They deleted my other slack!
[31:42.560 --> 31:44.080]  I mean, that's easy, but...
[31:44.080 --> 31:46.600]  What's the company's policy on fictitious employees?
[31:47.020 --> 31:51.940]  I think we're against it on paper, but we could probably get around it otherwise.
[31:56.860 --> 32:02.440]  Tis the season of giving. Get the perfect gift for a special someone, yourself, or both.
[32:02.440 --> 32:09.400]  Our friends at Shady Rays have you covered with premium polarized shades and quick-swap snow goggles that won't break the bank.

[32:41.940 --> 32:46.400]  But that's not all. Shady Rays offers the most insane protection in all of eyewear.

[33:43.400 --> 33:47.520]  What do you call a person who speaks three languages? Trilingual.
[33:48.140 --> 33:50.200]  Someone who speaks two? Bilingual.
[33:50.900 --> 33:53.080]  Someone who speaks one? American.
[33:53.680 --> 33:57.240]  Only 22% of Americans speak a language other than English at home.
[33:57.720 --> 34:01.360]  Start learning a new language this fall and be the exception, not the rule.
[34:01.620 --> 34:05.940]  Because with Babbel, you start speaking a new language in just three weeks.
[34:06.360 --> 34:09.300]  This fall you can start speaking a new language with Babbel.
[34:09.660 --> 34:11.640]  Why Babbel? Because it works.
[34:11.640 --> 34:17.660]  Instead of paying hundreds of dollars for a private tutor or fooling yourself with language apps that are little more than games,

[34:44.240 --> 34:51.380]  It makes it simple to order takeout, get directions, or speak to merchants without having to consult apps while on vacation, which sucks.
[34:51.680 --> 34:52.680]  Nobody wants to do that.
[34:53.340 --> 34:57.180]  Plus, I mean, you just learn so much. It's a great app. It's great features.
[34:59.400 --> 35:02.620]  There's sound effects for it when you get something right too, which is awesome.
[35:02.620 --> 35:06.740]  So, like, hello, which is also in French known as bonjour.
[35:07.180 --> 35:08.760]  You get the nice little ding.
[35:09.400 --> 35:14.120]  Studies from Yale, Michigan State University, and others continue to prove Babbel is better.
[35:14.620 --> 35:20.320]  For instance, one study found that using Babbel for 15 hours is equivalent to a full semester at college.

[35:44.120 --> 35:46.640]  Rules and restrictions may apply.
[35:47.680 --> 35:52.420]  Cold turkey may be great on sandwiches, but there's a better way to break your bad habits.
[35:52.620 --> 35:56.560]  And we're not talking about some weird conspiracy self-help crazy thing.
[35:56.560 --> 36:01.700]  No, we're talking about our sponsor, Fume, and how they look at the problem in a different way.
[36:02.220 --> 36:09.160]  Not everything in a bad habit is wrong, so instead of drastic and comfortable change, why not just remove the bad from your habit?
[36:09.700 --> 36:13.260]  Fume is an innovative, award-nominated device that does just that.
[36:13.700 --> 36:16.120]  Instead of electronics, Fume is completely natural.
[36:16.560 --> 36:19.300]  Instead of vapor, Fume uses flavored air.
[36:19.760 --> 36:24.100]  And instead of harmful chemicals, Fume uses all-natural, delicious flavors.
[36:24.100 --> 36:27.740]  You get it. Instead of bad, Fume is good.
[36:28.040 --> 36:32.560]  It's a habit you're free to enjoy and makes replacing your bad habit easy.
[36:33.120 --> 36:38.340]  Your Fume comes with an adjustable airflow dial and is designed with movable parts and magnets for fidgeting,
[36:38.700 --> 36:44.520]  giving your fingers a lot to do, which is helpful for de-stressing and anxiety while you break your habit.
[36:45.220 --> 36:52.120]  The Fume just feels so good. It's a great, well-weighted device. It's balanced. It's just extremely fun to fidget with.
[36:52.120 --> 36:56.420]  And it's awesome looking. It's just a beautiful thing you could really feel cool using.
[36:57.080 --> 37:02.680]  Stopping is something we all put off because it's hard, but switching to Fume is easy, enjoyable, and even fun.
[37:03.220 --> 37:09.100]  Fume has served over 100,000 customers and has thousands of success stories, and there's no reason that can't be you.

[37:30.000 --> 37:34.320]  Um, hey, Tony took it the wrong way.
[37:36.360 --> 37:39.020]  Wait, so you could zip the top off?
[37:41.920 --> 37:49.420]  I just told him that it needs to get wider. Should I delete that and say this is great?
[37:50.600 --> 37:52.740]  You should just say, never mind, it's perfect.
[37:54.740 --> 37:59.080]  If I tried to wear that, I would look like Diglett.
[37:59.440 --> 38:02.240]  We have such a history of shithats on this podcast.
[38:02.240 --> 38:05.620]  Can somebody explain to the audience what that is?
[38:06.140 --> 38:11.260]  So it's a beanie right above where you fold a beanie up.
[38:12.340 --> 38:15.080]  Right above that fold is a zipper.
[38:16.220 --> 38:19.580]  You unzip it and the beanie gets taller?
[38:20.420 --> 38:25.340]  I deleted the thing where it said it needs to get wider and I just said, yeah, that's it.
[38:36.210 --> 38:40.370]  This is the most insane show I've ever worked on.
[38:40.690 --> 38:43.150]  What the fuck is this?
[38:43.950 --> 38:46.910]  That's the greatest thing I've ever seen. Oh my god.
[38:47.730 --> 38:50.650]  And that's not something I say lightly. The audience knows that.
[38:50.650 --> 38:57.290]  He said weird, but okay. I'm thinking that's a bit more of a comeback with maybe a bag. No, it's perfect.
[39:01.040 --> 39:04.560]  So I'm curious about, what does the zipper do?
[39:05.240 --> 39:08.260]  It makes the beanie taller.
[39:09.040 --> 39:13.160]  Oh, I see. So it could also just be a head strap.
[39:15.320 --> 39:16.380]  It could be a what?
[39:16.680 --> 39:20.720]  Head strap, right? Because you could unzip the lower part.
[39:21.620 --> 39:23.120]  Am I misunderstanding this?
[39:23.580 --> 39:27.120]  This doesn't solve Andrew's problem at all.
[39:27.380 --> 39:30.320]  No, but it solves the laughter problem pretty hard.
[39:31.800 --> 39:35.680]  I'll definitely try it and get back to you if this is a better option.
[39:36.160 --> 39:39.540]  Here's what we could do now, though, is we could have a design or maybe some text.
[39:39.980 --> 39:42.660]  And then when you unzip it, there's like a hidden word.
[39:43.860 --> 39:46.540]  So it says something different when you're in long hat mode.
[39:47.660 --> 39:54.480]  Gavin wants it to have a hidden word under the zipper.
[39:55.160 --> 40:02.900]  So, quote, you can see a word when you're in long hat mode.
[40:03.220 --> 40:04.200]  More like an extra word.
[40:04.400 --> 40:05.940]  Regulation versus extended.
[40:06.520 --> 40:07.900]  Yeah, can it say extended mode?
[40:12.330 --> 40:13.490]  Fully extended.
[40:17.370 --> 40:18.710]  Oh, dear.
[40:19.690 --> 40:22.130]  That's the fucking wildest thing.
[40:23.190 --> 40:25.590]  I just want to physically see what it looks like.
[40:25.830 --> 40:30.730]  I gotta say, man, I think that might be the first time that has ever been invented.
[40:31.250 --> 40:33.450]  I don't think anybody's ever thought...
[40:34.230 --> 40:35.530]  You think that's a uniform first?
[40:36.010 --> 40:37.890]  Yeah, I think it might be a uniform first.
[40:37.970 --> 40:42.930]  I don't think that anybody's ever thought about a hat in that specific way before.
[40:44.410 --> 40:49.770]  We'll usually invent something for uniform and then I'll get like 3,000 emails of other versions of it.
[40:49.830 --> 40:51.670]  I don't think that's gonna happen this time.
[40:51.770 --> 40:52.630]  That feels unique.
[40:53.110 --> 40:54.370]  A unique invention.
[40:55.450 --> 41:01.230]  I had a moment where I felt unique and special earlier this week.
[41:01.710 --> 41:03.290]  I was really excited for a moment.
[41:04.730 --> 41:07.250]  Oh, we got another one. It just says in it.
[41:07.250 --> 41:14.290]  So the top could say in it, like the question, and then you unzip it and it says in it.
[41:16.070 --> 41:17.810]  That's perfect, that's perfect.
[41:25.060 --> 41:27.180]  Andrew, I'm sorry, you were feeling special?
[41:27.580 --> 41:30.320]  No, the in it is amazing. I'm excited about it.
[41:30.340 --> 41:36.180]  As you know, I've been campaigning real hard for the Cock Awards.
[41:36.560 --> 41:39.500]  I've been putting the shifts in, running my campaigns.
[41:40.960 --> 41:42.860]  Doing all that I can for it.
[41:42.920 --> 41:44.360]  I feel like the reception has been great.
[41:44.740 --> 41:45.460]  Got real excited.
[41:45.620 --> 41:49.900]  Got an email earlier this week for the Beak Awards.
[41:50.020 --> 41:54.300]  An invite to the Rooster Teeth Beak Awards, which I'm assuming are now the Cock Awards.
[41:55.060 --> 41:56.260]  Rebranded as the Beaks.
[41:56.660 --> 41:56.940]  Correct.
[41:57.340 --> 41:58.220]  And I got real excited.
[41:58.360 --> 42:01.800]  I looked at it and my dumb brain went, oh, an invite.
[42:01.860 --> 42:03.860]  I don't remember if I've ever gotten one of these.
[42:03.980 --> 42:06.800]  I mean, I've been to three all-hands meetings at this point.
[42:06.800 --> 42:09.220]  I think things are looking good.
[42:09.560 --> 42:10.620]  Things are looking bright.
[42:11.120 --> 42:17.180]  And the fact that I'm getting invited, maybe this means I'm a shoe-in to win the Cock, finally.
[42:17.740 --> 42:18.840]  And then I looked at it.
[42:18.920 --> 42:24.280]  I opened it further and saw it said, guest list is too large to display.
[42:24.860 --> 42:29.700]  I thought that this was a personalized email because there was no CC on it.
[42:29.780 --> 42:30.920]  It was just to me.
[42:31.620 --> 42:33.040]  Oh, but it's for everyone in the whole company?
[42:33.040 --> 42:37.560]  It was just a company-wide invite that is so large that it was in no way special.
[42:37.740 --> 42:41.400]  So I don't know. I'm no longer taking it as a shoe-in, guaranteed win.
[42:41.400 --> 42:42.980]  Well, think about it this way.
[42:43.300 --> 42:46.800]  There are seven and a half billion people on Earth.
[42:47.200 --> 42:48.920]  Almost none of them got that email.
[42:49.660 --> 42:50.440]  That's... Geoff.
[42:51.360 --> 42:53.320]  Geoff, I'm loving you today.
[42:53.580 --> 42:57.880]  Well, your Alan Wake 2 thing, you made me feel a little worse about it, but you've raised me here.
[42:58.340 --> 43:00.840]  That's a great spin. I love your spin zone on this.
[43:00.840 --> 43:05.500]  I'm happy to do it, man. It's all about building each other up. That's what I'm here for.
[43:05.780 --> 43:07.760]  Yeah, that's what we do. Yeah, innit?
[43:09.620 --> 43:13.900]  Hey, so we're getting probably pretty close to you waxing confused.
[43:13.920 --> 43:14.960]  Yeah, four minutes from now.
[43:15.040 --> 43:16.760]  So one more thing I want to ask.
[43:16.940 --> 43:23.000]  You know, we had the discussion about the Smut podcast, and then we decided that we were going to write our own Smut.
[43:23.520 --> 43:28.520]  And then Andrew and Eric backed off almost immediately and left it to Gavin and I.
[43:28.520 --> 43:36.800]  So I have written... I'd say probably 60% of our sex scene, and I presented it to you guys today.
[43:36.980 --> 43:39.620]  Wanted to see what you thought about it. Definitely want to get Gavin's feedback.
[43:39.900 --> 43:46.920]  And I need him for some of the British slang authenticity, because I'm trying to understand Cockney rhyming slang, and it's difficult, even with Wikipedia.
[43:47.700 --> 43:55.400]  Real quick feedback. I briefly showed Gracie the amount that you wrote, and she just went, oh my God.
[43:55.600 --> 43:57.620]  Yep, that's the appropriate reaction.
[43:57.620 --> 43:59.340]  I mean, that's kind of how I feel, too.
[43:59.660 --> 44:04.940]  Well, yeah. So my question is, because these books are like 400 pages long, I need to set a setting.
[44:04.960 --> 44:08.200]  I need to provide a little bit of background for what's going on.
[44:08.480 --> 44:15.160]  I don't want to spoil it by reading it or talking about it here, because I think it should appear on that other podcast as a part of the Clutch My Pearls podcast.
[44:15.280 --> 44:16.820]  Like that's where it should debut, I think.
[44:16.820 --> 44:20.060]  We can't actually wreck their podcast with this, though, can we?
[44:20.280 --> 44:23.400]  I assume we would just have them do a segment on ours.
[44:23.400 --> 44:28.400]  No way. I want them to read Geoff's insane writing on their show.
[44:28.400 --> 44:35.060]  Dude, they're doing a fucking episode on a... I hope I'm not spoiling this, but I heard them the other day.
[44:35.420 --> 44:41.520]  They're doing a Thanksgiving episode, and one of the short stories is a guy's dick can come out anything.
[44:41.800 --> 44:47.300]  And so they lose their turkey, and so the guy jizzes out a butter-rum turkey.
[44:47.580 --> 44:50.940]  So I don't think anything I've written is out of pocket here.
[44:50.940 --> 44:53.520]  You've never been in a tight jam on Thanksgiving before?
[44:54.540 --> 44:55.700]  What book is that?
[44:56.560 --> 45:00.920]  And I think that I was setting a mood, but my question to y'all is...
[45:02.140 --> 45:05.080]  What do you think about it? Am I on the right track?
[45:05.460 --> 45:07.620]  How do you feel about the scene that I've presented?
[45:08.960 --> 45:12.340]  It's about... I'll say this. It's about a man and a woman and an alien.
[45:13.660 --> 45:16.880]  I mean, is this something that... I just thought it'd be more of a group effort.
[45:17.380 --> 45:21.440]  Well, the group isn't doing anything. First off, Andrew and Eric said no.
[45:21.860 --> 45:23.280]  Because you and I...
[45:23.280 --> 45:27.520]  I felt like we were pretty clear about I don't want anything to do with this, and neither did Andrew.
[45:28.020 --> 45:30.080]  Okay, well, I thought...
[45:30.080 --> 45:32.660]  I thought we would, you know, get together, have a little writing session.
[45:33.180 --> 45:35.840]  So I guess Gavin is upset that you two didn't get together for coffee.
[45:35.840 --> 45:37.900]  So what you're saying is you don't like what I've written.
[45:38.260 --> 45:40.420]  Well, I'm saying, can I chime in for a paragraph?
[45:41.220 --> 45:43.680]  I want you to have full input into it.
[45:43.680 --> 45:46.540]  That's what I said when I said I just... this is just a jumping off point.
[45:46.660 --> 45:50.280]  I've written this. I'd love for your feedback. I'd love for you to participate.
[45:50.640 --> 45:53.660]  Mark it up. Change it as much as you want to. I want you to be a part of it, too.
[45:55.420 --> 45:57.240]  I mean, hell, I wrote you into it.
[46:00.580 --> 46:01.300]  Glormalium protodongarian.
[46:02.800 --> 46:06.300]  Glormalium protodongarian is the emissary of the alien sex race, yes.
[46:06.620 --> 46:08.540]  Wait, so Gavin is in the story?
[46:09.120 --> 46:11.820]  Well, a proximity... approximation of Gavin is you didn't...
[46:12.180 --> 46:12.840]  It's a woman.
[46:13.560 --> 46:16.480]  Yeah, okay, well it was a Gavalina sploogery, I think is her name.
[46:16.960 --> 46:18.860]  Geoff is the Alan Wake of smut.
[46:19.200 --> 46:20.500]  He's just putting people in stories.
[46:21.020 --> 46:22.300]  I'm gonna find this in a lunchbox.
[46:24.960 --> 46:26.560]  Okay, I'm gonna go apply the wax. I'll be back.
[46:26.940 --> 46:28.300]  It will be a collectible someday.
[46:29.300 --> 46:32.540]  Anyway, I just wanted to know if you guys thought my... I mean, I worked really hard on it.
[46:32.660 --> 46:36.660]  I just thought I made something pretty fun and good and sexy and I just wanted to see what you guys thought.
[46:36.720 --> 46:38.740]  But all I'm getting is just negativity.
[46:39.420 --> 46:40.060]  No, no, no.
[46:40.060 --> 46:42.160]  I really liked it. I just was...
[46:42.160 --> 46:46.020]  I just hope I can add a little bit of descriptive smut of my own.
[46:46.300 --> 46:49.200]  You can add as much as you want. You can change it if you want to.
[46:49.400 --> 46:50.900]  No, I think what you've said is...
[46:50.900 --> 46:53.780]  Somebody had to put something to paper first.
[46:54.100 --> 46:57.960]  Yeah, I bet you were able to shit all of that out in like 10 minutes too.
[46:59.360 --> 47:01.480]  Because you could just write. You could just go.
[47:01.800 --> 47:04.940]  It took me a little longer than 10 minutes, but yeah, it was pretty fast.
[47:05.460 --> 47:09.000]  But I was also... It was fast, but it was hard.
[47:09.340 --> 47:11.240]  And it was hard. It was hard brain work.
[47:11.420 --> 47:15.240]  Were you worried about like building the universe out? Like keeping everything consistent throughout the story?
[47:15.640 --> 47:17.960]  I don't want... Here's what I don't want.
[47:18.100 --> 47:24.420]  I don't want to just present a boring ass scene where a dude and a lady and an alien are going at it.
[47:24.480 --> 47:28.620]  And you don't understand their motivations. You don't understand the implications.
[47:28.900 --> 47:32.740]  You don't understand the gravity of the situation and what's at stake.
[47:32.740 --> 47:34.940]  So I tried to... I understand that it's paragraphs.
[47:35.360 --> 47:41.040]  But I tried to build out my world so you would understand like why they need to have sex.
[47:41.280 --> 47:44.220]  Yeah, I think... I think that part really comes through here.
[47:44.780 --> 47:50.180]  Yes, the only way. Glorb, glorb, borg, dorg, glab, borg.
[47:51.080 --> 47:52.760]  I think... Like, I get it.
[47:53.080 --> 47:54.960]  It's the Swedish chef fucking...
[47:54.960 --> 47:58.260]  No, no. That's... I mean, that's him speaking in his alien language.
[47:58.520 --> 48:00.520]  That's just how it sounds to us.
[48:00.520 --> 48:06.100]  This is the kind of thing that if you found scrawled in a notebook, you'd immediately be terrified and you'd start looking over your shoulder.
[48:06.240 --> 48:06.300]  Yep.
[48:06.980 --> 48:11.400]  And what he said, it's... You're quoting him. What he actually said was to the United Nations,
[48:11.880 --> 48:19.280]  To save society, we must fuck society. It is the way. Yes, the only way. Glorb, glorb, borg, dorg, glab, borg.
[48:19.680 --> 48:19.900]  Yeah.
[48:20.240 --> 48:24.140]  Which is... I don't know what that means, but in his language, it's like some Winston Churchill shit.
[48:24.380 --> 48:26.820]  Yeah, I just didn't want to spoil too much, you know, so...
[48:26.820 --> 48:31.720]  Between recordings, I thought it'd be cool if we both wrote a paragraph and they had to figure out who wrote which paragraph.
[48:32.000 --> 48:33.520]  But now I think they're definitely going to know.
[48:38.690 --> 48:40.130]  Andrew, did you apply the wax?
[48:41.030 --> 48:42.170]  I'm working on it.
[48:42.410 --> 48:45.870]  Oh, he's... Okay, never mind. Sorry. I thought he had gotten close. I thought he had come back.
[48:46.130 --> 48:47.950]  You can still hear us. Can you still hear us, Andrew?
[48:49.030 --> 48:49.230]  Yeah.
[48:49.450 --> 48:50.290]  We've messed it up.
[48:52.230 --> 48:53.630]  Andrew, what position are you in?
[48:55.110 --> 48:56.410]  Andrew, give us the play-by-play.
[48:57.070 --> 48:58.690]  It's on the pubes!
[48:59.430 --> 49:03.250]  Oh, God. It's a point of no return. Point of no return.
[49:04.570 --> 49:05.530]  Oh, boy.
[49:06.390 --> 49:07.910]  How do I know when it's done?
[49:08.210 --> 49:09.870]  Oh, that's an unfortunate phrase.
[49:10.770 --> 49:13.910]  Yeah, are you getting close to the mic to rip it off or what?
[49:15.050 --> 49:16.610]  I'll be moving back in a minute.
[49:17.690 --> 49:17.930]  Okay.
[49:18.650 --> 49:21.310]  Man, turning Nick's mic on was the best decision we ever made.
[49:24.490 --> 49:24.930]  Goddamn.
[49:25.310 --> 49:26.190]  Oh, man.
[49:28.310 --> 49:29.490]  I'm so eager.
[49:29.910 --> 49:31.070]  We're just invested in this now.
[49:31.230 --> 49:32.250]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:32.350 --> 49:34.690]  I've got notes that I don't even want to talk about. I can't wait for this.
[49:34.830 --> 49:37.430]  I know, same. And hey, by the way, can I be honest with you guys?
[49:37.490 --> 49:44.510]  I had so much fun writing that scene today, and I'm so into the world-building of what's called my story, which is called the breakout session.
[49:44.630 --> 49:46.210]  I might write the whole goddamn novel.
[49:46.830 --> 49:47.070]  Wow.
[49:47.850 --> 49:49.910]  Or Gavin and I might write the whole goddamn novel.
[49:49.910 --> 49:57.150]  I'll give you co-creator credit, obviously co-writer credit, if you want to actually get in there in the weeds with me.
[49:57.790 --> 49:58.890]  In the dick weeds with me.
[49:59.190 --> 50:01.650]  I feel like when it comes to books, the ratio is a little off.
[50:02.290 --> 50:05.630]  Like the cookbook, that was... I wrote one thing, I think.
[50:07.150 --> 50:10.770]  Well, yeah, somebody just had to make the book, and so I did that.
[50:10.850 --> 50:12.250]  I begged you guys for your recipes.
[50:13.570 --> 50:14.490]  Over and over and over again.
[50:14.510 --> 50:14.870]  That's true.
[50:15.110 --> 50:15.530]  Thank you, Nick.
[50:15.650 --> 50:15.950]  You're welcome.
[50:16.830 --> 50:18.510]  Great, great decision turning that mic on.
[50:20.630 --> 50:27.370]  That fucking cookbook's not gonna come out till like next April or something, even though it's done, because it takes forever to get shit printed and made.
[50:28.290 --> 50:29.210]  And I'm... yeah.
[50:30.210 --> 50:31.430]  But I'm really proud of it.
[50:32.770 --> 50:35.170]  I hope people will like it as much as they like our sex book.
[50:35.670 --> 50:36.390]  Wait, when does it come out?
[50:37.130 --> 50:39.050]  I think it's like next spring.
[50:39.730 --> 50:39.970]  Oh, wow.
[50:39.990 --> 50:41.210]  Takes a long time to get shit printed.
[50:41.630 --> 50:42.510]  Yeah. Oh, he's back.
[50:42.950 --> 50:43.550]  I'm back.
[50:43.970 --> 50:44.690]  Andrew, are you back?
[50:44.870 --> 50:46.370]  I screwed up almost immediately.
[50:46.910 --> 50:48.530]  Okay, well, set the scene.
[50:49.030 --> 50:49.410]  What happened?
[50:49.830 --> 50:53.690]  So, first of all, I don't know how much wax you're supposed to put on, so I hope there's enough.
[50:53.970 --> 50:58.610]  I just... I kept... I also don't know what side of the paper is supposed to have wax on it.
[51:00.610 --> 51:02.030]  But we got through that.
[51:02.130 --> 51:09.750]  The issue that I had was you're supposed to pull against the grain, and I immediately didn't do that.
[51:09.950 --> 51:16.010]  I left one corner that was like pullable easily, and it's the wrong way.
[51:16.010 --> 51:17.630]  So I don't know if that'll make it worse.
[51:18.130 --> 51:19.470]  I don't think it'll make it better.
[51:19.750 --> 51:21.650]  Can you just peel up the other side a little?
[51:22.050 --> 51:23.890]  I think it'll just make it less effective.
[51:24.690 --> 51:27.150]  It's heavily locked in.
[51:28.170 --> 51:31.010]  Is there a way you can get right up on that microphone?
[51:31.010 --> 51:34.170]  Oh, I will. I will when it's time. Yeah, I'll give it probably like one more minute.
[51:34.230 --> 51:35.830]  What do you mean when it's time? How long does it have to sit?
[51:36.070 --> 51:37.190]  I think like five minutes.
[51:37.470 --> 51:37.690]  What?
[51:38.690 --> 51:40.690]  That doesn't sound right, does it?
[51:41.310 --> 51:41.670]  No.
[51:42.250 --> 51:43.370]  How do you figure out your grain?
[51:43.490 --> 51:44.530]  Oh, wait, Gracie's typing.
[51:45.110 --> 51:47.170]  Gracie said, I don't think so.
[51:47.910 --> 51:49.370]  I think you said it.
[51:49.530 --> 51:53.670]  You kind of like rub it on, and then you pull.
[51:53.750 --> 51:55.530]  Yeah, pretty instant once you put the paper on.
[51:55.790 --> 51:58.210]  I mean, you can leave it for five minutes and go to a hospital.
[51:58.650 --> 52:01.390]  I mean, all of the funny TikToks I've seen, it's pretty instant.
[52:01.590 --> 52:04.430]  Well, we're already at five minutes, so I'm just, I'm gonna, here we go.
[52:04.830 --> 52:05.170]  Oh boy.
[52:08.240 --> 52:10.220]  I don't even...
[52:12.940 --> 52:13.860]  Give me a second.
[52:15.900 --> 52:16.620]  If he...
[52:18.900 --> 52:19.800]  Is he just gonna go?
[52:20.060 --> 52:23.960]  It would have been so funny if he had like a piece of paper or something that he just ripped really loudly.
[52:24.980 --> 52:27.300]  Or like had Velcro he just put right next to the microphone.
[52:27.300 --> 52:27.780]  Are we ready?
[52:28.520 --> 52:28.780]  Yeah.
[52:29.540 --> 52:30.160]  Yeah, do it.
[52:39.040 --> 52:40.920]  It's a good time. Thanks, Gavin.
[52:41.940 --> 52:42.620]  Great time.
[52:44.360 --> 52:45.080]  Good times.
[52:45.960 --> 52:50.800]  Oh, I'm having fun.
[53:02.090 --> 53:04.390]  It worked with the grape.
[53:05.010 --> 53:08.970]  It was so long.
[53:09.410 --> 53:11.690]  It sounded like he stomped on a crisp packet.
[53:17.890 --> 53:19.090]  Oh, I'm getting it.
[53:19.530 --> 53:21.250]  Oh, this is good.
[53:24.090 --> 53:24.970]  I'm back.
[53:28.390 --> 53:29.810]  He has to be bleeding.
[53:30.130 --> 53:30.850]  Yeah, absolutely.
[53:33.170 --> 53:43.770]  Do you remember in the breakfast club when Emilio Estevez was crying because he and his buddies held a dude down and taped his butt cheeks together and when they ripped the tape off it bled?
[53:44.090 --> 53:46.850]  If that makes somebody bleed, there's no way this isn't...
[53:47.650 --> 53:52.250]  It's probably like in a fucking horror movie when you cut somebody's arm off and the blood just goes bloop, bloop, bloop.
[53:52.250 --> 53:55.010]  Gracie said that she gasped it was so loud.
[53:57.870 --> 53:59.970]  That was great.
[54:00.410 --> 54:03.350]  That made me laugh so hard I started sweating.
[54:05.270 --> 54:06.510]  Oh my God.
[54:06.610 --> 54:07.630]  So loud.
[54:08.090 --> 54:10.410]  So do you think he has unwaxable pubes or no?
[54:10.850 --> 54:12.290]  Oh, I think they're pretty waxable.
[54:13.770 --> 54:15.090]  Oh my God.
[54:15.610 --> 54:16.450]  Andrew, how are you feeling?
[54:17.830 --> 54:18.870]  I think he left.
[54:19.210 --> 54:20.730]  He said he was going to go for a minute.
[54:20.970 --> 54:21.790]  Oh, did he pass out?
[54:23.370 --> 54:26.950]  He's getting the paramedic to help him down the stairs right now.
[54:27.030 --> 54:31.790]  Anyway, I got it figured out for you guys. I just had to order a jackhammer this week instead.
[54:31.970 --> 54:34.970]  Right, right. Thank you. Really appreciate that. Hey, tomorrow we're jackhammering, huh?
[54:35.210 --> 54:41.350]  We are. By the time you hear this, we will have already jackhammered and started filling bean hole pens.
[54:41.710 --> 54:43.710]  Wait, if you're out of town, how did you manage the jackhammer?
[54:43.710 --> 54:47.810]  Because I had to do it with the limited time that I had while catching up. I had to jackhammer.
[54:48.150 --> 54:53.250]  I need to, I need to like talk to this person and make sure they're okay with us filming it.
[54:53.550 --> 54:55.510]  This isn't like, I can't just like book an appointment.
[54:56.130 --> 54:57.950]  No! The pube thing!
[54:59.750 --> 55:02.510]  I think, I think what I'm, I'm going to speak Eric for a second.
[55:02.730 --> 55:09.050]  What Eric's trying to say in his angry Eric language is that he was running on a limited amount of time because he was out of town.
[55:09.050 --> 55:15.830]  So he had to prioritize the things he did. And this hanging Chad had been lingering for a lot longer than the pube thing.
[55:15.930 --> 55:16.990]  So he prioritized it.
[55:17.590 --> 55:23.590]  You're the head of a whole department. You've got employees. I didn't expect you personally to arrange it.
[55:23.950 --> 55:33.350]  I'm not going to make Gracie call a waxing woman and say, hey, we want to film this kind of like a glory hole situation.
[55:33.670 --> 55:38.630]  I'm going to go ahead and take that one on. It just, unfortunately, this is the way it worked out this week.
[55:42.010 --> 55:49.390]  I'm trying to, I'm trying to protect my employees from having to do the things that are shameful.
[55:49.730 --> 55:56.710]  Well, A, it's work and B, maybe we should make a list of, um, un-delegateables.
[55:58.670 --> 56:03.730]  I think most of this podcast, most of this podcast is un-delegateables.
[56:04.070 --> 56:06.510]  I, I, I think I got to agree with Eric on that one.
[56:07.250 --> 56:13.750]  Oh, Andrew sent us a pie. Oh, no. Oh, my God. That's so much hair.
[56:13.770 --> 56:15.630]  By the way, Andrew dropped off the call.
[56:16.290 --> 56:20.850]  Oh, I will say there's no blood. He sent us a photo. No, this photo will never see the light of day.
[56:20.990 --> 56:25.970]  No, it'll never make it onto an episode or on Instagram. But God damn, that looks painful.
[56:26.490 --> 56:28.010]  Zero blood, though. Zero blood.
[56:29.550 --> 56:34.250]  It's kind of like, I'd like you to use that dog shit camera again.
[56:34.250 --> 56:40.910]  And there's also like, there's like a handprint in the, in the glare on the table.
[56:41.710 --> 56:51.950]  I like, I like that it has shot, shot on UMI Digi G1 Max. Watermark at the bottom.
[56:53.150 --> 56:57.990]  Why is it so thin? It looks like, it looks like head hair.
[56:59.950 --> 57:03.890]  I don't want to get into a, into a pube thickness comparison.
[57:03.890 --> 57:09.550]  I just, I just imagine it's a slightly unfocused photo because he's shaking so much.
[57:11.150 --> 57:13.250]  Andrew, Andrew, are you back? How are you doing?
[57:14.170 --> 57:14.910]  I'm sweating.
[57:15.810 --> 57:16.710]  We are too.
[57:16.810 --> 57:17.510]  Because I'm having such a good time.
[57:18.950 --> 57:19.930]  Oh, God.
[57:20.270 --> 57:20.830]  Was there any blood?
[57:21.310 --> 57:24.890]  No blood, but it was like I got punched in the dick by Winnie the Pooh.
[57:26.270 --> 57:27.910]  Because it's like honey wax.
[57:27.910 --> 57:30.570]  What the fuck?
[57:31.550 --> 57:35.110]  It looks like I won a fight with Winnie the Pooh, but he took a lot of hair with him.
[57:38.830 --> 57:41.990]  So how does it feel? So first off, was it pleasurable?
[57:42.390 --> 57:44.430]  Oh, it was the best time I've had all year.
[57:44.790 --> 57:45.110]  Okay.
[57:45.310 --> 57:47.070]  Can't wait for you to experience it, Gavin.
[57:48.550 --> 57:50.130]  Do you feel smooth now?
[57:50.890 --> 57:53.590]  I feel sticky, is how I describe myself.
[57:54.530 --> 57:57.970]  Is it all gone? Did he get it all in one or is there more?
[57:58.390 --> 57:59.690]  Do you have lingering hair?
[58:00.950 --> 58:07.050]  We didn't have the men on the field for full coverage, but the zone that was covered has definitely been cleared.
[58:08.190 --> 58:09.130]  Gotcha, gotcha.
[58:09.950 --> 58:12.750]  So you think you'll make this a part of your normal routine?
[58:13.850 --> 58:20.130]  I mean, I feel lightheaded and sweaty and kind of like I need to lay down. So yes.
[58:20.470 --> 58:22.550]  So it's kind of euphoric is what you're saying. Interesting.
[58:22.550 --> 58:32.710]  Yeah, euphoric is a great way to put it. Definitely euphoric. I'm definitely a different person than I was 20 minutes ago. I've changed.
[58:33.290 --> 58:38.070]  Can I just say on behalf of Gavin and I, we're sorry Eric didn't protect you.
[58:38.490 --> 58:41.710]  No, I didn't. Eric did great, whatever Eric did.
[58:42.430 --> 58:49.530]  He doesn't. I don't even think he's making sense when he's talking. Whatever Eric did.
[58:49.530 --> 58:54.570]  I don't know what you had to do with any of what just happened, but whatever you did, you did a great job at it, buddy.
[58:55.390 --> 58:56.410]  He's so supportive.
[58:57.870 --> 58:59.210]  It's because he's such a kid.
[59:00.510 --> 59:01.530]  It's a euphoria.
[59:05.430 --> 59:07.150]  It's like he just got out of hot yoga.
[59:08.210 --> 59:09.810]  Oh, yeah, rejuvenated.
[59:12.370 --> 59:17.630]  Gavin, how do you feel about this? Does this embolden your idea that this is going to be a pleasurable experience for us?
[59:18.630 --> 59:23.170]  Yeah, I think it'll be good because he did an area much worse, in my opinion.
[59:23.630 --> 59:27.510]  Well, right. I mean, the whole point of this is you think it's going to be almost pleasurable to do that area.
[59:28.070 --> 59:29.030]  Yeah, I just think it won't hurt.
[59:29.370 --> 59:29.650]  Okay.
[59:30.330 --> 59:37.690]  Yeah, I think you're going to also be a different person on the other side of it, and I think you're going to have a great time.
[59:38.570 --> 59:40.670]  Where do we get... who's making the glory hole?
[59:40.930 --> 59:44.030]  That's the question we need. That's like the key part of this whole deal.
[59:44.030 --> 59:49.970]  What is the key part? And what does it look like? Is it just like the f*** face gray and black with the logo and the stars?
[59:50.010 --> 59:52.110]  I think it should say a f*** face production, right?
[59:52.150 --> 59:58.630]  I think it should be like a piece of wood with a hole in it that's painted green so you could add whatever you want to it easily.
[59:58.950 --> 01:00:03.290]  Oh, like a little green screen? Oh, our hair would be too close to it, though. It'd f*** up the hair. Our hair would be too close.
[01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:04.850]  You don't want to do it in camera?
[01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:06.490]  I think we should do it in camera.
[01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:08.030]  Yeah, I think we should get something made.
[01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:16.690]  Just get like some foam core made with like a f*** face production or a uniform production or a f*** face presented by uniform or something.
[01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:22.150]  I just think there's so many good ideas that it's tough to... like it could say anal passage across it. That's funny.
[01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:25.230]  We could do like a f*** face MGM thing. That's funny.
[01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:30.130]  Do we want to have just one hole for the face or do we want two leg holes as well?
[01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:32.250]  Why would you have two leg holes?
[01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:35.410]  I don't understand. Do you think this is your full body? What's happening?
[01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:38.610]  Why would you have leg holes?
[01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:40.630]  Gavin, I understand it. I like it.
[01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:42.990]  How? How do you understand it? What does that mean?
[01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:44.190]  Let me draw you a diagram.
[01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:46.470]  Like you'd be squatted.
[01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:53.710]  It's for your opening slate and then your ending slate. You get the front of us and the back of us.
[01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:59.710]  I don't think we can do that. Again, we have to work with a professional who has to do their job well.
[01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:04.590]  So like we try to just stay away from that area as much as we can.
[01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:06.450]  They're going to be in that area.
[01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:10.790]  They are. And so we should stay away from that with cameras.
[01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:15.250]  The glory hole screen will be in front of it. All you'll be able to see is thank you for watching.
[01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:19.530]  We just have to stay away from it all together is what I'm trying to get.
[01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:26.510]  Putting your head through a hole is already more than enough, I would think.
[01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:32.490]  Do you mean two diagrams? So like one would be for your legs and it would be double coverage. Is that what you're saying?
[01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:33.470]  What?
[01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:40.470]  Draw your diagram because I don't understand what you want this to be now.
[01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:43.690]  Yeah. Wait, are you talking to me or him?
[01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:45.590]  Dammit.
[01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:48.470]  Because I just pitched one. I just want to clarify.
[01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:50.650]  I'm in pain at the moment.
[01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:55.830]  Because what I'm imagining now in my head is that you have one for the back and one for the front.
[01:01:56.150 --> 01:02:00.550]  And the front is at the beginning of the video and your legs sticking through something is for the end of the video.
[01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.010]  What are you going to show?
[01:02:03.790 --> 01:02:05.290]  Everyone's wrong. Everyone's wrong.
[01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:09.570]  What are you going to show for the legs? It doesn't make any sense.
[01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:12.450]  Well, no, it could be what his legs do when it's getting waxed.
[01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:17.370]  Are you saying like the person is going to be folded up and their legs and their head are going to be out of the same one?
[01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:23.590]  Okay, so I'm having trouble with the...
[01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:26.670]  Oh, is it because it doesn't make any sense?
[01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:28.670]  No, it makes sense. It makes sense.
[01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:29.290]  Oh, okay.
[01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:31.350]  My idea definitely makes sense.
[01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:33.870]  Okay, hold on. I've got to send this now.
[01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:38.370]  Just putting your head through a thing is way more than enough. That's all we need.
[01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:41.950]  Yeah, you're probably right. I was just asking a question.
[01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:44.310]  Just asking questions, man.
[01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:47.510]  Yeah, I'm just a just asking questions guy. Don't worry about it.
[01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:51.810]  I'm just shooting ideas in. I've already had the beanie today. I thought maybe I'm going to roll.
[01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:52.950]  Here we go.
[01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:58.210]  It didn't solve the problem. They created the beanie and it didn't solve the issue.
[01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:59.250]  They made it tall.
[01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:02.250]  What the fuck did you just say?
[01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:03.930]  Oh, shit.
[01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:08.430]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see what you're saying.
[01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:10.050]  Downwards.
[01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:16.510]  You would see, right? A head through a hole and then below that it would be like a face production.
[01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:20.510]  And then you would see knees coming through, going down.
[01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:24.010]  Right, and this person is supposed to wax you...
[01:03:24.010 --> 01:03:24.650]  Yeah, under it.
[01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:26.670]  Under it?
[01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:31.130]  You don't think that's going to work? You don't think it's going to be you on all fours?
[01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:34.790]  I think you'd have to turn side. I think you'd have to lay sideways.
[01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.230]  On all fours?
[01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:39.350]  You don't think it's going to be you with your ass in the air, dude?
[01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:44.490]  No, I'm going to be on my back with my legs, with my knees tucked in the chest.
[01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:45.690]  Oh, you might.
[01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:47.750]  I thought you'd be on your stomach.
[01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:51.930]  I'll write this down because that's a question I have to ask. I guess.
[01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:53.970]  Gracie, how does it work?
[01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:56.670]  What the fuck are you doing right now?
[01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:56.730]  I don't know.
[01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:02.510]  Gracie just said four questions.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:10.800]  We're verging into weird territory right now.
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.380]  I need to know how it works. Is there anyone?
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.900]  How it works, however it works, we'll build around it.
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:27.760]  But I also think that there's some validity to the idea of having our heads stick out of one hole, and that'd be the beginning of the video, and then our feet sticking out of the other hole, and that'd be the thanks for watching part of the video.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.220]  And you can see our feet slam up as soon as the rip happens.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:36.000]  I will say, as the only person I believe here that has waxed...
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.540]  This is ridiculous.
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:43.580]  Gavin, your idea is fantastic. Great idea. Another good one by you. Great idea, buddy.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.740]  Ten out of ten. Another home run.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:53.320]  It's only too bad that this wasn't f***ing face-off, because that would have been a grand slam right there, that idea you just had. That drawing.
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:59.440]  My favorite part is how it took up 8% of the image.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:03.560]  It was big when I drew it.
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.860]  He likes to leave room for innovation.
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:08.920]  I'm starting the next tea towel.
[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:19.180]  We should make a f***ing face art book for like a coffee table book. That's just all of our drawings and paint.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.300]  We got aisles in a supermarket.
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:25.480]  We got Andrew's bedroom diagrams.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:28.700]  We've got the Gerpler.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.260]  Whatever the f*** you just drew.
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.800]  So we won't be able to do any of this with our head through a hole?
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.820]  Yes, we'll have to.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:44.320]  What I'm saying is that you laying on your back is like... I think that that is such wishful thinking.
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:49.660]  I just don't think that... I think you will have to be on all fours or on your side.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.320]  I don't think that you're going to be on your back.
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.700]  If you're on your back, how would you stick your head through the hole?
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:00.920]  Like in the image, like in the diagram.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.440]  No, you're right. You got me there. That's a good point.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.900]  You'll have to hold your knees up.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.440]  That's what the holes for the legs are for.
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:19.600]  We can definitely at least get your face through a hole while you scream and say, I was wrong, I was wrong.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.160]  So we can get that.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:28.520]  But I will ask what position you will be in. And then that will inform what kind of...
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:29.640]  Contraction.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:34.660]  That will inform what kind of slate that we will have around you.
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:36.720]  Wait, what's happy baby yoga pose?
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:39.320]  Yeah, Gracie said it's happy baby yoga pose. Let's Google that.
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:41.300]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.620]  That makes sense.
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:50.260]  That gives full access to the gooch right there.
[01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:59.290]  No wonder I'm in such a good mood. I was in happy baby. I didn't even know it.
[01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:01.510]  I tapped into my happy baby.
[01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:07.670]  Gonna be the least flattering position I will have ever been filmed in.
[01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:13.390]  I'm not gonna film any of that. I'm just getting your face.
[01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:17.610]  Gavin, it may come down to you rotoscoping our dicks out of stuff again.
[01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:23.810]  No, we can hide it under the board and we just need like a selfie stick, I think, just to get the angle.
[01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:26.310]  Okay, okay, that's cool. That makes sense.
[01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:29.470]  I think this is gonna work. This is gonna work.
[01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:35.170]  Yeah. I just want to say great ep, everybody. That was really good performances all around.
[01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:37.310]  Thanks, Andrew.
[01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:38.170]  You're welcome.
[01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:40.590]  I had fun. That was a great hour.
[01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:42.710]  Good energy. Good energy by everybody. Good vibes.
[01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:44.870]  Really happy with what everybody brought to the table today.
[01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:47.830]  Mm-hmm. Can we end this now?
[01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:59.190]  You raring to jump into that next recording we have to do immediately after this?
[01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:02.350]  The soprano sounds great. I can't wait for some sopranos.
[01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:08.750]  Are you gonna need a few moments to collect yourself or do you think you're ready to go?
[01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:10.150]  I'm well and collected.
[01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:14.810]  Yeah, you sound like it. It sounds good.
[01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:23.090]  All right, well, there you go. You heard it here. Andrew is well and collected. He's still riding that euphoric waxing high.
[01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:30.350]  Thanks for listening to another episode of the F*** Face podcast. Out of 180 episodes recorded, this was definitely one of them.
[01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:36.150]  Why don't you tell a friend about this podcast and maybe convince him to listen to an episode or two?
[01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:43.510]  This might be a good place to start. Might be a bad place to start. Maybe don't do it. Or maybe do do it. I'll leave that up to you. You've got autonomy. We'll see you next time.
[01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:48.150]  Hey, guys. Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:50.450]  Everyone's favorite movie is Poimal Fear.
[01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:52.170]  Is it time to shave our heads?
[01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:54.550]  Or is it Crazy Frog Rule 34?
[01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:57.130]  Is it a sub, hoagie, or grinder?
[01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:58.910]  The boys dug another hole.
[01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:00.410]  Nick is the dirt man.
[01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:02.790]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:05.770]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
