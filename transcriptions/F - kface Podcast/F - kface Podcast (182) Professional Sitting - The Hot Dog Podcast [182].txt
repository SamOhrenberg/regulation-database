[00:10.300 --> 00:13.100]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:13.380 --> 00:17.080]  This is number 182. With me, as always, Andrew Panton.
[00:17.260 --> 00:19.820]  And I'm reasonably certain Gavin's here somewhere as well.
[00:20.020 --> 00:20.940]  I have a question.
[00:21.200 --> 00:22.040]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:22.320 --> 00:22.740]  Hi, Geoff.
[00:23.660 --> 00:24.680]  Are you going to ask your f***ing question?
[00:24.800 --> 00:26.880]  What's your f***ing question, Gavin?
[00:27.160 --> 00:29.280]  I was waiting for you to stop saying hello to everyone.
[00:30.920 --> 00:32.520]  OK, so so the band
[00:34.020 --> 00:37.180]  based on Band Blink 182, right?
[00:37.680 --> 00:38.040]  Yes.
[00:38.040 --> 00:38.340]  Yeah.
[00:39.060 --> 00:41.880]  Why is it that everyone in America says
[00:42.940 --> 00:43.660]  Blink 182?
[00:44.180 --> 00:46.880]  But for some reason, I grew up calling it Blink 182.
[00:47.260 --> 00:49.740]  Like, is that just like all of my friends and me are idiots?
[00:50.160 --> 00:54.000]  No, it's it's what it's what everyone in I think England calls them Blink 182.
[00:54.100 --> 00:55.900]  Like internationally, they're called that.
[00:56.000 --> 00:56.680]  Why is that, though?
[00:56.700 --> 00:59.380]  Because it's not like it's not the name of the band, but that is what they're called.
[00:59.700 --> 01:00.360]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:00.440 --> 01:03.040]  It's like when there's a different word or a different phrase,
[01:03.040 --> 01:05.720]  it kind of makes sense from a cultural point, I guess.
[01:05.740 --> 01:07.720]  But it's the actual name of the band, though.
[01:07.720 --> 01:08.840]  There's only one right answer.
[01:09.400 --> 01:10.240]  Yeah, that is weird.
[01:11.160 --> 01:14.220]  Do you know why they're called Blink 182 or 182?
[01:14.560 --> 01:15.300]  I don't know.
[01:16.120 --> 01:18.020]  The band was originally called Blink.
[01:18.120 --> 01:21.040]  Their first album, Cheshire Cat, was actually released as Blink.
[01:21.120 --> 01:24.720]  But there was another existing band named Blink that sued them.
[01:25.180 --> 01:27.140]  And so they had to change their name.
[01:27.720 --> 01:31.920]  And I don't think they've ever definitively said why they picked 182.
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.400]  But I think the general wisdom is that it was a playoff
[01:35.400 --> 01:37.860]  of the old Timothy Hutton movie, Turk 182,
[01:39.080 --> 01:42.120]  about a kid whose older brother, Fred Ward,
[01:42.640 --> 01:45.380]  the original Remo Williams, Fred Ward, was a firefighter
[01:45.380 --> 01:49.220]  who was drinking at a bar one night and a fire happened.
[01:49.460 --> 01:52.140]  And he'd had like two beers, but he ran up and he saved a bunch of people.
[01:52.140 --> 01:54.060]  But in the process, he almost died.
[01:54.440 --> 01:57.480]  And the city didn't want to pay his health coverage
[01:57.480 --> 01:58.900]  because he was off duty and drunk.
[01:59.020 --> 02:02.340]  And so Timothy Hutton became like a tagger.
[02:02.340 --> 02:07.160]  And he went around tagging like slogans for his brother all around New York.
[02:07.180 --> 02:12.520]  And he was tagging like subway buses, subways, trams.
[02:12.680 --> 02:14.300]  And then they tried to stop him.
[02:14.360 --> 02:15.800]  And it was like this whole fucking thing.
[02:15.860 --> 02:18.820]  And he would like he like figured out a way to cut through.
[02:19.040 --> 02:22.460]  Like they they introduced like ungraffitiable trains.
[02:22.460 --> 02:25.480]  And he figured out a way to to still graffiti them.
[02:25.500 --> 02:27.100]  And it was like a whole that was the whole movie.
[02:27.140 --> 02:31.100]  And I'm pretty sure that's why they named the band Blink 182 or renamed it.
[02:32.040 --> 02:33.580]  Ungraffitiable or make a train ungraffitiable.
[02:34.500 --> 02:36.280]  It was supposed to be like some alloy.
[02:36.500 --> 02:38.120]  I don't remember. This movie came out like 1985.
[02:38.800 --> 02:39.700]  I haven't seen it since then.
[02:39.820 --> 02:42.600]  But I remember it was some sort of like alloy that was like resistant.
[02:42.800 --> 02:43.920]  You could just wipe it off or something.
[02:44.040 --> 02:47.980]  And so he brought a blowtorch and like cut through it and then graffitied under it.
[02:48.120 --> 02:49.320]  Yeah, now that's extreme.
[02:49.680 --> 02:51.680]  That's not what I heard was the name.
[02:51.980 --> 02:57.240]  I heard that like growing up, they're from a city in San Diego called Poway.
[02:59.280 --> 03:04.880]  And the rival sort of like high school that Tom DeLonge got kicked out of was Rancho Bernardo R.B.
[03:05.060 --> 03:09.500]  And the 182 is 18 to R.B.
[03:09.720 --> 03:12.540]  And that was it was like a fuck R.B. thing.
[03:12.740 --> 03:13.740]  That's what I had always heard.
[03:13.860 --> 03:15.440]  But I have no idea.
[03:15.960 --> 03:20.400]  I'm sure at some point they officially said where it came from.
[03:20.440 --> 03:21.560]  So I'm sure the audience can.
[03:22.740 --> 03:24.740]  I think I equally don't care.
[03:25.260 --> 03:27.000]  Yeah, no, I think I'm with you.
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.780]  But I think that we just gave two different things and there's going to be someone online so mad that we gave two explanations and neither were right.
[03:34.240 --> 03:35.200]  Yeah, probably.
[03:36.200 --> 03:41.260]  Blink 182 or Blink 182, as I call them, recently released a new album.
[03:41.480 --> 03:43.840]  It has a song called F*** Face on it.
[03:44.460 --> 03:49.360]  And I've enjoyed that because when I've looked at when you search F*** Face on YouTube,
[03:50.100 --> 03:54.660]  one of our episodes pulls up alongside of it like a very specific one.
[03:54.660 --> 04:00.680]  And I've noticed it has continually gotten more views because it's like autoplaying after the song.
[04:00.860 --> 04:07.240]  It's either autoplaying because it's only like a 30 second song or people searching for the song.
[04:07.340 --> 04:09.460]  And that one episode pulls up.
[04:10.860 --> 04:14.180]  It has like 30,000 views on YouTube.
[04:14.560 --> 04:16.460]  And it just which episode is it?
[04:16.740 --> 04:18.240]  I don't remember which one it is, though.
[04:18.700 --> 04:22.560]  I wonder how many Blink 182 fans we've disappointed in the last two weeks.
[04:24.100 --> 04:26.840]  So many. More than 182 of them.
[04:29.680 --> 04:32.520]  Oh, well, Gavin, how are you feeling, buddy?
[04:32.680 --> 04:34.700]  You doing OK? Yeah, I got some air.
[04:35.100 --> 04:36.880]  Got a drink. Good.
[04:37.020 --> 04:38.020]  Good. How are you guys?
[04:38.320 --> 04:39.380]  You doing all right as well?
[04:40.080 --> 04:41.960]  I'm doing pretty good. I'm a little cold.
[04:42.940 --> 04:50.850]  Actually, you know, I'm just going to heat up for a minute.
[04:51.290 --> 04:52.730]  This is normal or what's happening?
[04:53.350 --> 04:54.130]  Yeah. Can you hear anything?
[04:54.130 --> 04:55.150]  Can you hear anything?
[04:55.750 --> 04:57.410]  No. Really? Oh, that's great.
[04:58.010 --> 04:59.350]  You got like a heater on or something?
[05:00.190 --> 05:01.890]  I'm in my bathtub right now.
[05:02.050 --> 05:03.290]  I just want some hot water.
[05:03.670 --> 05:04.990]  What the fuck?
[05:06.450 --> 05:07.150]  What do you mean?
[05:07.950 --> 05:11.450]  Are you are you nudie poodie in a bathroom right now?
[05:12.130 --> 05:12.530]  Yeah. Yeah.
[05:13.730 --> 05:15.550]  I have been for the past two episodes.
[05:16.190 --> 05:18.530]  Oh, Nick actually did ask if you were in a different room.
[05:18.830 --> 05:19.430]  He did. Yeah.
[05:19.730 --> 05:20.650]  I was worried about it.
[05:20.650 --> 05:28.290]  I draped a blanket over my towel bar to try to reduce echo in the space.
[05:28.570 --> 05:32.090]  So you're you're like in the tub with a roof?
[05:32.770 --> 05:35.910]  I'm no, it's like it's just draped over the side.
[05:36.050 --> 05:41.550]  So it looks like what would be a like shower curtain, essentially.
[05:41.550 --> 05:42.610]  But it's just a blanket.
[05:42.610 --> 05:44.150]  And I'm a shower curtain next to me.
[05:45.670 --> 05:46.430]  Here's the thing.
[05:46.570 --> 05:48.650]  I waxed my pubes two episodes ago.
[05:48.650 --> 05:50.770]  It's the least comfortable I've been on the show.
[05:51.050 --> 05:53.590]  So I decided I deserve to be the most comfortable.
[05:54.230 --> 05:56.110]  So I've just been in the bath for the past two episodes.
[05:56.530 --> 05:57.550]  I just had my setup over.
[05:57.770 --> 05:58.810]  How are you liking it?
[05:59.270 --> 06:00.330]  It's really cozy.
[06:00.430 --> 06:02.050]  And the fact that you guys can't hear the water running,
[06:02.150 --> 06:03.790]  although it might be in the recording.
[06:03.970 --> 06:05.170]  Well, of course it'll be in the recording.
[06:05.650 --> 06:06.390]  Yeah, it's definitely.
[06:07.110 --> 06:09.550]  Yeah, I could hear it there for a second, too, actually.
[06:10.030 --> 06:11.410]  OK, well, I should turn the water off.
[06:12.250 --> 06:13.910]  Well, I don't want you to be comfortable.
[06:14.470 --> 06:15.410]  Well, no, it's good.
[06:15.450 --> 06:16.330]  I got a little bit more heat.
[06:16.330 --> 06:19.330]  Let me move the mic to see if I can get the sound of it
[06:19.330 --> 06:20.190]  a little bit more clearly.
[06:21.010 --> 06:23.530]  What are the chances he electrocutes himself before the end of this episode?
[06:24.730 --> 06:25.570]  Here's a question.
[06:26.650 --> 06:28.650]  Assuming that happens and Andrew dies.
[06:29.090 --> 06:31.330]  Yeah. Do we release this final episode?
[06:32.250 --> 06:36.630]  Uh, well, I feel like he'd have to give pre consent for that.
[06:36.730 --> 06:37.870]  Oh, yeah, I think so.
[06:37.930 --> 06:38.890]  That's fine. Yeah, absolutely.
[06:39.270 --> 06:42.430]  Let's go ahead and go on record as saying if I die in an episode,
[06:42.710 --> 06:45.290]  this is my pre approval for you to play that episode.
[06:46.330 --> 06:51.950]  OK, so see, I have I have the laptop on the toilet next to me because it's level.
[06:52.150 --> 06:53.550]  I can reach all the buttons.
[06:53.810 --> 06:54.590]  This camera.
[06:56.190 --> 06:57.190]  Yeah, it also might.
[06:57.330 --> 06:59.810]  But the battery on my camera is too low for my flash,
[06:59.870 --> 07:01.750]  so I don't have the best photos right now.
[07:01.990 --> 07:06.190]  This is me looking through the setup to my bedroom.
[07:09.510 --> 07:11.970]  This camera is making everything look real dingy.
[07:12.390 --> 07:14.650]  Yeah, well, it's dark in here.
[07:15.430 --> 07:19.570]  I love that every year cameras get better and cheaper.
[07:19.730 --> 07:23.590]  And every year this podcast and Andrew's images get worse.
[07:24.070 --> 07:25.730]  I don't even know what that third picture is.
[07:25.890 --> 07:26.670]  What am I looking at with that?
[07:27.130 --> 07:28.970]  That's the bathtub.
[07:29.350 --> 07:34.650]  Yeah, it's the water and the faucet and the knobs that you twist.
[07:35.190 --> 07:37.190]  Why is the tap so far down?
[07:37.290 --> 07:38.490]  It's like halfway down the tub.
[07:38.790 --> 07:40.690]  No, that's where the water comes out.
[07:42.370 --> 07:42.890]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:42.990 --> 07:44.590]  It's a taller tub.
[07:45.330 --> 07:49.450]  It's a tub where the the overflow drain is halfway up it?
[07:50.510 --> 07:51.890]  No, you're looking at the wall.
[07:52.350 --> 07:53.830]  That's the wall. There's a cut off.
[07:54.190 --> 07:59.010]  You see the red bottle that I got stuck in my ass at one time to the right of it?
[07:59.870 --> 08:01.370]  That's the top of the tub.
[08:01.730 --> 08:02.130]  That's right.
[08:02.350 --> 08:03.930]  But the tap is halfway down.
[08:04.930 --> 08:05.290]  Yeah.
[08:06.010 --> 08:08.950]  And the overflow thing is also like you can never fill it up.
[08:09.150 --> 08:11.390]  No, the the overflow is below the tap.
[08:11.890 --> 08:12.550]  Yeah, I see it.
[08:12.550 --> 08:14.930]  OK, so how much space is between that?
[08:15.050 --> 08:17.830]  Like, can you get fully submerged before the overflow kicks in?
[08:18.030 --> 08:19.150]  No, not at all. No.
[08:21.830 --> 08:25.510]  What I'm saying is if you clogged, if you plugged up the overflow,
[08:26.090 --> 08:28.350]  you could have a bath that's like twice as tall.
[08:29.070 --> 08:30.170]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[08:30.170 --> 08:30.810]  Before it overflows.
[08:32.270 --> 08:33.030]  Yeah, absolutely.
[08:33.230 --> 08:33.930]  You could. Yeah.
[08:34.010 --> 08:36.010]  I think you would enjoy baths more if you did that.
[08:36.190 --> 08:36.910]  I would. Yeah.
[08:37.030 --> 08:38.990]  I wish it was taller, to be completely honest.
[08:39.970 --> 08:40.550]  But I'm comfortable.
[08:41.110 --> 08:45.010]  You should consider getting some gum or something to stick in there
[08:45.010 --> 08:48.710]  to close it up so you can experience a taller, a taller bath.
[08:49.070 --> 08:50.810]  We could get you some Flex Seal tape or something.
[08:51.110 --> 08:52.310]  Oh, yeah. That would work.
[08:53.350 --> 08:55.930]  I was thinking about taping a roof on this setup,
[08:56.030 --> 08:58.270]  but I just I threw the blanket over instead.
[08:59.590 --> 09:01.910]  Throw a towel over the shower.
[09:02.290 --> 09:02.870]  Yeah, it's not bad.
[09:03.290 --> 09:04.150]  Sounds good enough to me.
[09:04.950 --> 09:06.950]  Is the toilet seat sturdy enough to hold that laptop?
[09:07.810 --> 09:09.190]  Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.
[09:09.610 --> 09:10.250]  It's all good.
[09:10.890 --> 09:13.430]  It's like a little table in this level. It's perfect. It's nice.
[09:13.830 --> 09:16.870]  I am noticing that even though the seat is down, I can see into the toilet.
[09:17.490 --> 09:18.910]  But yeah, it's a little it's a little off.
[09:19.070 --> 09:20.070]  I got to reattach it.
[09:21.710 --> 09:23.290]  Pops off every now and then.
[09:23.690 --> 09:24.390]  As they do.
[09:24.830 --> 09:26.290]  It is. Yeah, pop offs do occur.
[09:27.910 --> 09:28.690]  But I'm comfy.
[09:29.430 --> 09:32.410]  So this is the second episode of a back to back,
[09:32.450 --> 09:34.450]  and they always tend to be a little weirder.
[09:35.890 --> 09:36.610]  We've noticed.
[09:37.210 --> 09:39.170]  Is there anything you guys want to cover this episode?
[09:39.170 --> 09:41.110]  I want to talk about the email that you wrote.
[09:41.230 --> 09:41.670]  Yeah, the chair.
[09:41.910 --> 09:42.470]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[09:42.470 --> 09:43.690]  Let's let's hear about that.
[09:43.810 --> 09:45.790]  So, Geoff, you wrote a wonderful email.
[09:46.290 --> 09:47.090]  Really funny.
[09:47.490 --> 09:48.770]  Very great. Great.
[09:49.230 --> 09:50.630]  Just a great all around email.
[09:50.830 --> 09:54.830]  The the only problem with it, and it sort of appeared immediately
[09:54.830 --> 09:58.650]  in the replies I got, I reached out to a bunch of companies.
[09:58.670 --> 10:00.630]  I'd say 30 plus chair companies.
[10:00.630 --> 10:03.070]  And I'll continue to send out emails in this process.
[10:04.130 --> 10:07.990]  A lot of people didn't know that I wanted a free chair.
[10:08.430 --> 10:12.790]  Yeah, the email serves as an icebreaker or actually an ice melter,
[10:12.930 --> 10:15.350]  because when people read that email, they're immediately disarmed.
[10:15.590 --> 10:20.650]  And it was crafted in such a way that they would be completely opened up
[10:20.650 --> 10:24.650]  to the idea of initiating some sort of a relationship or conversation with you.
[10:24.730 --> 10:28.010]  And then at that point is when you like slide in the I need a free chair.
[10:28.790 --> 10:34.210]  Yeah. So a lot of people just interpreted it as how many chairs do you want to order?
[10:34.810 --> 10:40.550]  There was another bucket of people that their response was, our chairs have a warranty.
[10:41.190 --> 10:44.910]  And that was it. That was the like, you're not there's no challenge here.
[10:46.850 --> 10:52.850]  But on Monday or Tuesday, maybe Tuesday, I got an email.
[10:53.030 --> 10:55.990]  I'm not going to say this person's name or the company they work for.
[10:56.890 --> 11:01.290]  But I got I got an email back from someone and their response was,
[11:01.290 --> 11:07.690]  Hi, Johnny. Ha, you came to the right place. Professional sitters unite.
[11:08.070 --> 11:13.210]  Are you able to share who your client is? Let me know. Thanks.
[11:13.590 --> 11:19.330]  I freaked out. It was, you know, like in the dark night where it's like a dog chasing cars
[11:19.330 --> 11:24.050]  wouldn't know what to do if like they caught one. I felt that I never thought this would happen.
[11:24.210 --> 11:28.590]  It was phrased in such a perfect way. I immediately reached out to Gracie because
[11:28.590 --> 11:32.410]  I wanted you guys to have like a reaction in the moment. I could talk to anyone else about it on
[11:32.410 --> 11:39.590]  the show. So I didn't know what to do. I went into full panic mode. So what I did,
[11:40.830 --> 11:45.730]  the first thing I thought is I need to create more time for myself to decide whatever it is
[11:45.730 --> 11:53.230]  I'm going to do. And so I replied to that email with, Hi, it's so nice to hear from you.
[11:53.470 --> 11:57.230]  I'm sure my client is going to be thrilled. You're going to say that.
[11:57.630 --> 12:03.670]  Yeah, I got a blanket. Yeah, sorry. That was cute. I was too relaxed in the tub.
[12:04.390 --> 12:10.310]  Please bleep the name. That's, you know, that's the dilemma with this tub life.
[12:11.150 --> 12:16.050]  I think it's like truth serum for you. It might be. Yeah, this is a dangerous place for me to be.
[12:16.990 --> 12:20.870]  This could be dangerous for you, Andrew. It is. Yeah, this is, we're never doing this again.
[12:21.150 --> 12:23.630]  This is the last tub episode. Hey, what do you do at the marathon?
[12:24.910 --> 12:31.330]  I've already talked about that. Anyway, email. It's so nice to hear from you. I'm sure my client
[12:31.330 --> 12:36.530]  is going to be thrilled to know we shared enthusiasm for professional sinning. My client
[12:36.530 --> 12:42.130]  values privacy, so I must verify with them before disclosing who they are. What I can say is that
[12:42.130 --> 12:46.750]  they work in the entertainment industry. I'm sure they won't have any issue with me disclosing who
[12:46.750 --> 12:52.070]  they are in this context, but I must confirm first. Thank you for your timely response and
[12:52.070 --> 12:55.810]  understanding. I will reach out again as soon as I hear back from my client.
[12:56.610 --> 13:03.110]  So that was phase one. Nice. The second phase was I wanted to remove any connection Johnny
[13:03.110 --> 13:09.570]  Caviar had to this podcast. So I googled it, and the only thing that would pull up that was
[13:09.570 --> 13:15.090]  immediately related to us was one Reddit thread about Starfield, a character, and it was named
[13:15.090 --> 13:19.910]  Caviar, and it mentions Johnny Caviar. So I reached out to that person, and they were kind
[13:19.910 --> 13:24.570]  enough. I wish I... I'll credit them later. I should have wrote their name down. They deleted
[13:24.570 --> 13:29.850]  their post for me. So now that didn't appear. So it removed all connections. And then I thought,
[13:29.970 --> 13:36.090]  I need to try to impress this person. So, and also I just think it's so funny, the idea that
[13:38.130 --> 13:44.130]  any status I have makes no sense and is dumb. I wrote this really dumb tweet where it was the
[13:44.130 --> 13:50.510]  night the time changed over, and I wasn't paying attention. And I didn't know if the time had gone
[13:50.510 --> 13:55.610]  back yet, or if I was just still going forward and would go back later. And it was a real dilemma.
[13:55.950 --> 14:01.710]  I was very jarring in that moment to not know what time it actually was, if it was truly 1.12,
[14:02.390 --> 14:08.210]  or if we'd go back. So I, I quote tweeted that tweet and asked people to like it,
[14:08.270 --> 14:13.790]  because I planned on sharing my Twitter account with this person. And I wanted the top tweet to
[14:13.790 --> 14:19.250]  be ridiculous and have as many likes as it could, to just look like it had larger numbers. And I was
[14:19.250 --> 14:23.150]  shocked by how many, thank you so much to all the people that did that. It has like over 4,000 likes.
[14:23.330 --> 14:30.430]  It's ridiculous. It's so dumb that people, yes. So I did all that. And then I waited until this
[14:30.430 --> 14:35.430]  morning. I gave like two days because I wanted to seem like Johnny Caviar's a busy man. His client
[14:35.430 --> 14:42.570]  is doing stuff. So I, I replied today and I said my apologies for my delayed response.
[14:42.570 --> 14:47.710]  After talking with my client, they are more than happy to have me share that they are none
[14:47.710 --> 14:53.050]  other than Andrew Panton. If you're not familiar with his work, I will provide some links at the
[14:53.050 --> 14:58.390]  bottom of this email. He has set multiple world records in games such as Garfield Kart 2,
[14:58.890 --> 15:06.210]  as well as being a host on an award-winning podcast. If you have any questions about my client,
[15:06.450 --> 15:11.850]  I would happily provide more info. I hope you're having a wonderful week and I'm hopeful we may
[15:11.850 --> 15:19.470]  further our professional sitters alliance into a chair sponsorship for my client. I then linked
[15:19.470 --> 15:26.030]  the news story of when my local paper covered my Garfield Kart exploits, my world record setting,
[15:26.430 --> 15:31.790]  my Twitter account, and the Let's Play YouTube account. And that's where we're currently at
[15:31.790 --> 15:37.030]  with the Johnny Caviar, your letter saga. I have not heard back. I suspect I won't hear back again
[15:37.950 --> 15:44.330]  from the person who will be bleeped, but I will keep you updated. I was shocked that at first,
[15:44.650 --> 15:49.830]  on the first day I replied or sent it the next day, I had like three or four responses like,
[15:49.930 --> 15:53.830]  oh my God, this is way more than I thought. Nobody was going to respond to this, even though it was
[15:53.830 --> 16:00.710]  how many did you send? Uh, probably like 35 at this point. Okay. Wow. And I went to like,
[16:00.770 --> 16:06.170]  the first thing I did was Google, uh, notable chair brands. And I found a list of the top 15
[16:06.170 --> 16:11.070]  that I sent them all emails. And then I just started like, I went for unconventional things
[16:11.070 --> 16:16.130]  as well of like, I don't really want a beanbag chair, but those are chairs. So I sent out a
[16:16.130 --> 16:21.010]  bunch to beanbag chair companies and I assume that I would get replies from them because I feel like
[16:21.010 --> 16:26.030]  a beanbag chair is sort of a more chill thing. And they'd be more open to this form of communication,
[16:26.030 --> 16:31.850]  not a single reply from any of the beanbag chair companies. Nobody wanted part of that.
[16:31.850 --> 16:36.250]  Did you venture out of like desk chairs? Like, did you hit up Lazy Boy or anything like that?
[16:36.370 --> 16:41.630]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. They were part of the top 15, I believe. So I reached out to
[16:41.630 --> 16:48.670]  everyone that I could and that department, um, Herman Miller, all, all brands. And I'll continue
[16:48.670 --> 16:54.210]  to. Dude, if you could snag a free Herman Miller chair, that'd be pretty fucking fantastic.
[16:54.410 --> 16:57.250]  Yeah. I don't think Herman Miller is going to want to partner with us.
[16:59.610 --> 17:03.970]  Yeah. Yeah. They might be able to trust their chairs. I don't think they want to be in the
[17:03.970 --> 17:10.650]  sponsorship, uh, bucket with, uh, with, with. I don't think that's their brand. Well, maybe it
[17:10.650 --> 17:14.810]  should be. I'm going to keep at it. I'll keep you guys updated. I don't think I'm going to get a
[17:14.810 --> 17:18.630]  chair through this, but I'm enjoying the interactions. I'm appreciating having the
[17:18.630 --> 17:24.230]  Johnny Caviar email. That's just fun to have. I'm having a great time. Yeah. That's that email
[17:24.230 --> 17:30.110]  alone is going to pay dividends down the road. We've established, uh, you know, uh, basically
[17:30.110 --> 17:35.330]  like a personal assistant for you, Andrew, that we can use, uh, whenever appropriate. I think
[17:35.330 --> 17:39.210]  that's, that's going to be a great resource for us down the road and you're making connections.
[17:39.410 --> 17:43.950]  You may not, we may not end up with a chair today, but that bleeped person who knows where
[17:43.950 --> 17:49.570]  they're going to work in the future. You know what I mean? You left a caviar sized impression
[17:49.570 --> 17:53.330]  on them. Then who knows what dividends it could pay down the road.
[17:54.690 --> 17:58.110]  I'm hoping, I'm hoping to leave caviar impressions everywhere.
[17:58.770 --> 18:03.990]  I have a question for the group. What was the first thing that your parents could
[18:03.990 --> 18:07.090]  successfully bribe you with to get you to do what they wanted?
[18:07.590 --> 18:12.590]  Ooh. Oh, by the way, I really, can I just say, Gav, I really liked how you said you
[18:12.590 --> 18:16.610]  had a question and then you immediately asked the question. Uh, yeah, that was good.
[18:16.610 --> 18:20.250]  That was a much, much improved from earlier this episode.
[18:20.730 --> 18:28.130]  I would say I was less an incentive kid and more terrified of getting yelled at.
[18:28.590 --> 18:34.310]  So I was, I was a big, the countdown was very effective. If you don't do this by the time I get
[18:34.310 --> 18:42.610]  to zero, three, two, like that would always get me. I, I liked to push boundaries.
[18:43.950 --> 18:45.030]  Yeah. You know what I mean?
[18:45.030 --> 18:49.210]  That reads. So I don't know that a lot of shit worked with me.
[18:49.790 --> 18:54.450]  Renting a video game from Blockbuster. Oh, that's good. That's a good one.
[18:54.850 --> 18:57.530]  I was really, I was really into turnip roots when I was a kid.
[18:57.870 --> 19:00.210]  So my mom probably was able to bribe me with turnip roots.
[19:00.450 --> 19:02.570]  What the fuck did, what? What did you just say?
[19:03.030 --> 19:05.470]  What are you talking, what are you, Gavin, what's happening?
[19:05.930 --> 19:09.390]  It was like my favorite food when I was a kid was like a raw turnip root.
[19:09.930 --> 19:10.910]  Do you need some air?
[19:14.430 --> 19:15.950]  That is what it is, dude.
[19:16.830 --> 19:20.210]  No amount of air is going to change my taste buds when I was six years old.
[19:20.750 --> 19:21.790]  What's the turnip root?
[19:22.310 --> 19:23.790]  Yeah. Just a turnip?
[19:24.190 --> 19:27.870]  Uh, yeah, exactly. Exactly. You cut the ends off that and you can just eat it like an apple.
[19:28.230 --> 19:30.610]  It's spicy. It's like a, it's spicy and crunchy.
[19:31.270 --> 19:33.250]  It's like eating a giant radish.
[19:34.290 --> 19:37.650]  Yeah, kind of. It's kind of like eating a giant radish. I also really like radishes.
[19:37.650 --> 19:39.850]  And when I was a kid, that was like my favorite thing on Earth.
[19:40.190 --> 19:42.450]  And your mom would bribe you with them?
[19:42.630 --> 19:46.310]  I bet if she were to bribe me with stuff, that would have been what would have worked. Yeah.
[19:47.370 --> 19:50.670]  Did you acquire your taste for them while riding down the river with,
[19:50.710 --> 19:52.810]  with Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn?
[19:53.170 --> 19:58.190]  No, but I can, I can genuinely, I mean, like, I feel like I can remember my mom being like,
[19:58.510 --> 20:03.530]  if you'll just knock it off, I'll buy you a turnip root before we leave the grocery store.
[20:03.590 --> 20:04.170]  And I'll be like, okay.
[20:04.170 --> 20:09.490]  Do you remember the thrill of seeing your first horse carriage while enjoying a bite of a turnip root?
[20:09.930 --> 20:15.670]  Listen, I'm, if I, if I don't have to be honest with you guys, I'm telling you the truth.
[20:16.030 --> 20:22.710]  It is what it is. I, when I was a kid, I grew up in fucking Alabama. I feel like we know that,
[20:22.770 --> 20:32.290]  right? I hated Alabama for obvious reasons. In Alabama, in 1982, a turnip root was like a Snickers
[20:32.290 --> 20:37.770]  bar to me. That's why I don't want to go back there. But it is what it is, man. I fucking loved
[20:37.770 --> 20:42.010]  turnip roots. And I, I would love, now that I'm looking at it, I want one right now.
[20:42.570 --> 20:44.050]  When was the last time you had one?
[20:45.730 --> 20:48.490]  Oh, decades, probably. But I guarantee you.
[20:48.850 --> 20:50.530]  Can we film you eating a whole turnip root?
[20:50.870 --> 20:51.950]  Yes, 100%.
[20:51.950 --> 20:56.490]  We have to. I'm, absolutely. I want one tomorrow. I want today.
[20:56.950 --> 20:59.210]  Gracie's right. It should have been your regulation sandwich ingredient.
[20:59.710 --> 21:01.890]  Yeah, well, we hadn't, we hadn't had this conversation yet.
[21:02.450 --> 21:07.350]  Were you mad when the next generation of kids got to enjoy Big League Chew as their treat?
[21:10.170 --> 21:12.210]  I also got to enjoy Big League Chew.
[21:13.270 --> 21:17.370]  But man, I mean, it's just, I don't know what to tell you. This is the boiled peanuts and
[21:17.370 --> 21:21.270]  turnip roots and fucking, and shit like that, man. That's what, that's what we had.
[21:22.150 --> 21:22.370]  Yeah.
[21:22.930 --> 21:24.550]  I got to drink with my curly straw.
[21:26.250 --> 21:26.690]  What?
[21:27.070 --> 21:31.570]  That was my, like, if I did something good, I could use a curly straw.
[21:33.010 --> 21:37.690]  We were selling a straw, so I thought you meant that. And I thought that was just a
[21:37.690 --> 21:38.950]  really weird declaration.
[21:39.110 --> 21:41.970]  Geoff, I take back everything I said about your thing. This is...
[21:41.970 --> 21:46.770]  Yeah. I was just really excited by it. Watching all the liquid shoot around all the curves.
[21:46.910 --> 21:47.470]  It was amazing.
[21:49.050 --> 21:51.250]  You must really love the Gerpler straw, then.
[21:51.990 --> 21:54.190]  That's what I thought he was talking about, was the Gerpler straw.
[21:54.910 --> 21:57.950]  No, it was curly straw when he was a kid. And then he fucking got silent again.
[21:58.010 --> 22:00.050]  You know we made a Gerpler straw, right? Do you remember that?
[22:00.390 --> 22:01.870]  Is that the one where it goes through the text?
[22:02.510 --> 22:02.830]  Yeah.
[22:03.750 --> 22:04.890]  Did we sell that already?
[22:05.490 --> 22:05.690]  Yes!
[22:08.110 --> 22:08.950]  No, it's not out.
[22:09.150 --> 22:09.610]  When he...
[22:09.610 --> 22:10.650]  Oh, I didn't think it was out.
[22:10.770 --> 22:14.470]  All of a sudden, he, like, stops talking and I get so nervous. I'm like,
[22:14.510 --> 22:17.290]  I just wonder if, like, he passed out. I get, like, so nervous.
[22:17.850 --> 22:20.210]  No, it is today. For some reason, because I got such
[22:20.610 --> 22:24.290]  shite sleep, I can't think while I'm speaking.
[22:26.750 --> 22:28.710]  I have to do a lot of pre-thinks.
[22:29.270 --> 22:32.810]  Yeah, well, I mean, without an inner monologue, it must be tough.
[22:33.510 --> 22:37.270]  Well, if you want to take some time to load up some thoughts, we can cover for you.
[22:38.070 --> 22:40.770]  Well, I was just thinking, like, I didn't, I don't remember that straw coming out.
[22:40.990 --> 22:43.150]  I don't know that it came out yet. I think it comes out soon.
[22:43.270 --> 22:46.130]  It's hard for me to remember because I got mine in the mail, like, a month ago.
[22:46.650 --> 22:48.410]  So I assumed it had already come and gone, but...
[22:48.410 --> 22:48.750]  Not out yet.
[22:48.750 --> 22:53.810]  And it made me realize that the other thing that they could bribe me with to do well or
[22:53.810 --> 22:57.930]  do nice things was, uh, there was a playground that had a curly slide.
[22:57.930 --> 23:01.030]  And I think it was just, like, curly things for me as a kid.
[23:01.110 --> 23:02.390]  How do you feel about a curly fry?
[23:04.170 --> 23:06.030]  Never had them. I mean, now I...
[23:06.030 --> 23:06.690]  To this day?
[23:07.390 --> 23:11.030]  No, I've had them now, but I just, I'm not that fussed. I think the waffle is superior.
[23:11.810 --> 23:14.450]  What about, could I bribe you with a curly straw right now?
[23:14.870 --> 23:17.750]  I just don't think it works on me anymore. I think I've just, I've done them.
[23:17.990 --> 23:20.310]  What do you think works on you now? Yeah.
[23:22.730 --> 23:23.410]  That's a good question.
[23:23.430 --> 23:26.250]  Okay, well, you think about it. How about we ask you another question?
[23:27.210 --> 23:30.630]  Geoff, when did turnip roots die for you? You said decades?
[23:31.550 --> 23:33.390]  I mean, I think probably when I left Alabama.
[23:34.890 --> 23:39.450]  Now, do you ever think that maybe you actually didn't live in animal, or in Alabama,
[23:39.590 --> 23:42.870]  but lived in a town owned by Tom Nook? Because that's their currency.
[23:43.430 --> 23:46.070]  There's a value to turnips and turnip roots.
[23:46.590 --> 23:50.490]  I honestly hadn't considered that or ever made the connection until this moment.
[23:50.990 --> 23:54.950]  I think we've given Gavin enough time. What's your response to the question from a minute ago?
[23:54.950 --> 23:56.730]  The currency is bells, though.
[23:57.770 --> 23:59.670]  Oh, no, but there's the turnip exchange, whatever.
[24:00.950 --> 24:02.950]  Fucking, you're on the fly for that one.
[24:03.390 --> 24:06.250]  When it comes to shitting on me, you had that in the chamber.
[24:07.670 --> 24:09.630]  Billy the Kid over here all of a sudden.
[24:12.590 --> 24:16.110]  While this is going so well, allow me to add to it.
[24:16.830 --> 24:20.370]  I had an idea that I kind of pitched to you guys off camera recently,
[24:20.510 --> 24:22.610]  but I want to pitch it formally on camera.
[24:22.610 --> 24:25.890]  We haven't had a draft in a while. The audience has noticed it.
[24:25.950 --> 24:29.030]  People have been asking about it. We've discussed options for drafts.
[24:29.050 --> 24:32.250]  I think there was the idea that we could maybe do a potato draft out there in the future,
[24:32.350 --> 24:33.490]  which I'm totally amenable to.
[24:33.870 --> 24:38.450]  But I had an idea that I'm really excited about, I think could be a lot of fun.
[24:39.010 --> 24:40.310]  My only worry is this could be a lot.
[24:40.370 --> 24:42.290]  Well, no, I don't think I'm going to express the worry.
[24:42.430 --> 24:44.950]  I'm just going to say I think that this has a lot of legs.
[24:45.010 --> 24:45.810]  It could be a lot of potential.
[24:46.130 --> 24:51.150]  I want to do an everything draft where everybody drafts.
[24:51.150 --> 24:52.730]  Snake draft, like we normally do.
[24:53.090 --> 24:56.650]  Four slots. And the pool is everything.
[24:57.030 --> 24:58.490]  Yeah, I like it.
[24:59.030 --> 24:59.510]  Okay.
[24:59.710 --> 25:02.110]  I already have my picks lined up. I'm ready. I'm prepared.
[25:02.450 --> 25:04.710]  You already have four things from everything?
[25:05.130 --> 25:05.890]  Yeah, I do.
[25:06.070 --> 25:07.430]  How have you narrowed it down so much?
[25:07.630 --> 25:11.430]  Well, it's... I'm not living in your brain, first of all.
[25:11.910 --> 25:14.990]  And second, I think there's some pretty obvious things.
[25:15.630 --> 25:17.990]  You just need four things out of everything.
[25:18.270 --> 25:20.130]  You don't have a top four everything, Gavin?
[25:20.130 --> 25:24.130]  No, and I'm remembering now how much I got shat on in the rock draft.
[25:24.630 --> 25:30.170]  I can't imagine how heavily I'll be judged at my first pick of the everything draft.
[25:30.490 --> 25:31.870]  I think you're going to do great.
[25:31.970 --> 25:33.110]  I think we're all going to do great.
[25:33.270 --> 25:34.570]  I'm excited for the everything draft.
[25:34.690 --> 25:35.930]  We have a few drafts lined up.
[25:36.270 --> 25:39.290]  I feel like whoever gets to go first in the everything draft,
[25:39.770 --> 25:41.250]  there's never been more pressure.
[25:41.470 --> 25:42.630]  Yeah, Crack Rock A number one.
[25:45.110 --> 25:49.030]  I have an idea on how to modify this draft to make it a little unique.
[25:49.030 --> 25:50.670]  I wanted to see what you guys thought about it.
[25:50.770 --> 25:52.530]  If you guys disagree with me, it's totally fine.
[25:52.590 --> 25:54.230]  I'm not like married to this idea at all.
[25:54.630 --> 25:57.690]  It's just an idea for a modifier to the draft.
[25:58.130 --> 25:59.710]  But do you know how...
[25:59.710 --> 26:02.310]  As soon as you say it, Gavin, we'll take like 10 minutes, but I'll...
[26:02.310 --> 26:05.090]  Yeah, we'll circle back to Gavin before we end the episode.
[26:06.910 --> 26:12.530]  You know how like when you play games like Rainbow Six Siege and you play in like ranked mode,
[26:13.050 --> 26:19.870]  you can vote to eliminate one player that nobody can pick.
[26:19.990 --> 26:25.090]  So like if there's an OP player like Javier or whoever that always gets used,
[26:25.230 --> 26:26.370]  you can eliminate that player.
[26:26.450 --> 26:29.450]  So it's eliminated from the pool of people you can pick from.
[26:29.870 --> 26:35.590]  What if we all were able to eliminate one item from everything?
[26:36.110 --> 26:41.110]  So say like I'm voiding curly fries or whatever, and then nobody could pick that one.
[26:41.110 --> 26:46.230]  So it's the everything draft minus essentially four things, five things.
[26:47.070 --> 26:49.850]  Interesting. So we just like veto out a bunch of stuff up front?
[26:50.230 --> 26:55.150]  Yeah, you have like everybody gets one veto from the pool of everything out the gate.
[26:56.590 --> 27:02.450]  So just to clarify, I like the idea, but just to clarify the everything pool,
[27:02.910 --> 27:06.370]  it doesn't have to necessarily be a thing, right? Like an item.
[27:07.570 --> 27:09.370]  Like, yeah, it's everything.
[27:09.370 --> 27:12.290]  Everything is draft eligible in this pool.
[27:12.390 --> 27:14.950]  Yeah, you could be like, I'm vetoing blue.
[27:15.790 --> 27:18.010]  Sweet. Okay. I just want to make sure about that.
[27:18.470 --> 27:18.630]  Yeah.
[27:19.430 --> 27:22.730]  I recently had a thing, and I don't know if this is just my own specific interest,
[27:22.770 --> 27:25.170]  I think it'd be fun to do a fictional band draft.
[27:25.750 --> 27:27.690]  There are a lot of great fictional bands.
[27:28.330 --> 27:31.630]  So like Chain Drive from Lost, like that kind of thing?
[27:31.710 --> 27:34.250]  Spinal Tap. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
[27:34.370 --> 27:34.670]  Okay.
[27:34.830 --> 27:36.010]  Any fictional band.
[27:36.730 --> 27:37.570]  What do you say, Gavin?
[27:37.910 --> 27:39.270]  I was just laughing at Chain Drive.
[27:39.370 --> 27:40.390]  Isn't that what they're called?
[27:41.190 --> 27:41.310]  Drive Shaft.
[27:41.310 --> 27:41.990]  Drive Shaft? Chain Drive?
[27:42.350 --> 27:44.230]  Drive Shaft? That's all stupid. Who cares?
[27:44.690 --> 27:45.670]  It wasn't even real.
[27:47.890 --> 27:49.570]  Chain Drive is a better name than Drive Shaft.
[27:50.110 --> 27:50.430]  Is it?
[27:50.890 --> 27:51.190]  No.
[27:51.230 --> 27:51.930]  I don't think so.
[27:53.250 --> 27:54.690]  It's fine for you to think that.
[27:55.550 --> 27:57.110]  I already said no.
[27:58.850 --> 28:00.130]  Oh, I'm not sure I could even...
[28:00.690 --> 28:02.670]  Can I name four fictional bands?
[28:03.130 --> 28:05.150]  Is there not a fictional band in a James Bond movie?
[28:05.670 --> 28:08.930]  You can't name four of everything that you like.
[28:08.930 --> 28:13.130]  There's no way you can name four specific fictional bands right now.
[28:13.150 --> 28:14.570]  You get out of here.
[28:15.710 --> 28:18.670]  When anything is pickable, you couldn't think of four things.
[28:18.810 --> 28:21.870]  Yeah, right? The bands thing is so easy. This is nuts.
[28:22.770 --> 28:22.990]  Oh.
[28:24.510 --> 28:26.190]  Like Josie and the Pussycats.
[28:26.430 --> 28:26.570]  Yeah.
[28:26.870 --> 28:29.130]  Jim and the Holograms. The California Raisins.
[28:29.150 --> 28:30.550]  Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem.
[28:30.910 --> 28:32.170]  Otis Day and the Knights.
[28:33.110 --> 28:34.750]  Yeah, Otis Day and the Knights is a good one.
[28:35.130 --> 28:36.570]  Oh, Zach Kattack.
[28:36.630 --> 28:37.870]  The Blues Brothers.
[28:38.610 --> 28:39.590]  Soggy Bottom Boys.
[28:39.790 --> 28:40.570]  This is great.
[28:41.310 --> 28:42.650]  And see, I think it could be fun.
[28:42.790 --> 28:45.310]  Yep. Gavin, are you going to throw any in there? You got an idea or what?
[28:45.930 --> 28:47.130]  Yeah, I just threw in Zach Kattack.
[28:47.750 --> 28:49.010]  Oh, OK. There you go.
[28:49.430 --> 28:51.190]  So you got one, buddy. Way to go.

[33:45.110 --> 33:50.270]  When we did the Halo Let's Play that Eric watched, he was doing commentary like that to me
[33:50.270 --> 33:57.450]  in a genuine way, but it felt so facetious because I'm used to this. I can understand how it would
[33:57.450 --> 34:03.770]  feel undercutting. However, I was very much on your side and trying to read you on, but I get it.
[34:04.330 --> 34:09.150]  It was very jarring. I don't know how to handle Eric's positivity.
[34:09.150 --> 34:12.590]  I know what you mean. It never feels genuine.
[34:13.090 --> 34:19.590]  It feels a little weird. It's like it's off-putting coming from you.
[34:19.990 --> 34:21.430]  Thanks, man. It is.
[34:21.430 --> 34:23.150]  Yeah, no problem. But it's nice.
[34:23.770 --> 34:26.450]  It's a nice surprise when it does happen. Much appreciated when it happens.
[34:26.450 --> 34:32.010]  I just wanted to see you win in Halo Ranked. You know, play 4 games and then play 5 games
[34:32.010 --> 34:37.390]  and then all of them were in the wrong setting. And I need to thank you because we haven't talked
[34:37.390 --> 34:43.690]  about this, but I feel like it was just an established thing. After we did the wax episode,
[34:43.810 --> 34:51.550]  we did a recording, and it went in a way where it was supposed to be against you,
[34:52.070 --> 34:58.730]  but really I was the one that was suffering the most, and I also was just destroyed from
[34:58.730 --> 35:05.110]  the waxing process, and everyone allowed me to end that recording where you guys could've
[35:05.110 --> 35:11.190]  easily dragged that on for longer, and I would've just been stuck. So I feel like I owe you.
[35:11.950 --> 35:16.050]  You had already taken one for the team that day. We didn't want it to be a death.
[35:16.050 --> 35:22.150]  I had. That was a crazy experience, and I hope that when you guys get your buttholes waxed,
[35:22.410 --> 35:30.310]  it's not nearly as bad. It broke me. The pain sucked, but I was like, I think so,
[35:30.810 --> 35:35.330]  because I've never been waxed before, and I figured if I try it once, then I'll know what
[35:35.330 --> 35:39.070]  it feels like, and that actually might be worse than not knowing what the experience is going
[35:39.070 --> 35:44.270]  to be. So I was kind of dreading it the entire time, and I think when I got it over with,
[35:44.270 --> 35:49.910]  it was like an adrenaline dump, and I was just done for hours. And you just went for it too.
[35:50.030 --> 35:55.570]  You didn't piss about. No. Yeah. It was an experience that I cannot wait to see the
[35:55.570 --> 36:00.210]  results of what you guys do. And Eric made sure that that image was seen by everyone.
[36:02.430 --> 36:05.710]  I made sure Gracie saw it too. I didn't want her to feel left out, you know what I mean?
[36:05.730 --> 36:10.770]  Yeah, absolutely. Well, yeah, the next day, Gracie reached out to me and asked,
[36:10.910 --> 36:19.430]  am I okay with that image being used on socials? And that was a real... I didn't have my pubes on
[36:19.430 --> 36:25.070]  the internet on my bingo card that's maybe going to be in the expansion for Sloppy Jibs Bingo,
[36:26.030 --> 36:33.170]  but we're here. We're doing it. Oh, so you approved it? Yeah, absolutely I did. Oh my god.
[36:33.430 --> 36:38.070]  That's insane, dude. It wasn't a question of like, it wasn't even a debate of if I should,
[36:38.130 --> 36:42.850]  it was just more like I had to take a moment to be like, what a weird thing this all is.
[36:44.270 --> 36:47.950]  Did not anticipate that. I actually spooked myself recently.
[36:49.190 --> 36:53.610]  This is really funny. I forgot that I put it in my desk drawer,
[36:53.610 --> 36:57.370]  the wax strip, I still have it. Oh my god. Oh, come on.
[36:59.550 --> 37:03.790]  I just like, in the time, like I was in so much pain, I just put it somewhere,
[37:04.090 --> 37:09.250]  and that's where I put it. And so like, the other day, I went to see if I had some double A's in my
[37:09.250 --> 37:14.010]  desk and I opened the drawer and it was just the first thing I saw. It freaked me out. It was
[37:14.010 --> 37:20.570]  genuinely unnerving. Like, oh my god, that's so gross. Terrible. I never want to see it again.
[37:20.570 --> 37:24.450]  Are you planning on keeping it for a while? Well, it's like, it's a weird thing where I
[37:24.450 --> 37:30.030]  don't want to, but also like, what about the museum? We have, there's a place for relics.
[37:30.470 --> 37:34.770]  We're doing trading cards. You're right. You're right. You're right. We're doing chase cards,
[37:35.090 --> 37:42.010]  potentially, with trading cards. So like, oh, I forgot about that. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[37:42.750 --> 37:47.390]  To be pube cards. I don't know. I'm not saying that's a great idea, but like, it just,
[37:48.010 --> 37:52.970]  I feel like anything we do at this show, it's a mistake to throw away because you just never know.
[37:53.130 --> 37:58.530]  Are you allowed to mail pube? Well, we're not allowed to mail dirt, but I think pubes are okay.
[37:58.950 --> 38:04.790]  Have y'all seen those pube sunglasses? No. No. What? Uh, yeah, let me see if I find them. Yeah,
[38:04.830 --> 38:10.630]  there they are. Penelope's pubes. Hold on. Uh, why do I know about this? Why do you know about this?
[38:11.110 --> 38:17.670]  I don't know. Yeah, somebody made a pair of glasses and inside the plastic is just around
[38:17.670 --> 38:27.410]  the rims is just pubes. Oh no, I opened it. Oh no. Oh God. Only $432. Custom designed acetate
[38:27.410 --> 38:31.890]  with wire frame core sunglasses. Acetate has also been custom made and contains Penelope
[38:31.890 --> 38:38.930]  Gasson's actual pubes. Engraved on gold on both sides says fashion brand sunglasses for eyes.
[38:38.930 --> 38:44.930]  Whose birthday is coming up next? I'm not till next summer. Yeah, I'm not till spring,
[38:45.050 --> 38:52.570]  so it's gotta be Nick. Nick, when were you born? December. Yeah. Pube sunglasses for Nick.
[38:54.030 --> 39:00.910]  Happy birthday, Nick. Yeah, what other things can you put pubes in? Oh Jesus.
[39:03.030 --> 39:07.070]  I suppose the possibilities are endless. Yeah. Can we make the publa?
[39:09.470 --> 39:15.930]  Uh, what's a publa? A cupla with pubes in? Oh God. Oh, it's not in the cup though,
[39:15.990 --> 39:22.490]  it's just in the cup. I don't think any of this is a good idea. You don't think we should have
[39:22.490 --> 39:30.050]  one limited edition publa? No. I think it's one of those things that like in your head is great
[39:30.050 --> 39:35.070]  and then when it exists you go, oh yeah, this is exactly what I described and this is horrifying
[39:35.070 --> 39:38.710]  now that it's real. I don't know why I thought this was a good idea at one point.
[39:41.770 --> 39:45.910]  The publer. Gavin, I'm more open to the idea than the other guys are.
[39:47.650 --> 39:52.650]  Who's sourcing the pubes? I mean, we've done pubes stuff before. Gavin and I have gone deep
[39:52.650 --> 39:58.170]  on pubes. Our pubes have been content. It's not off-putting to us. Yeah, we're not afraid of pubes.
[39:58.670 --> 40:05.790]  Hey, you guys like hot dogs, right? Big time. Not after talking about pubes. Yeah,
[40:05.830 --> 40:11.350]  right after the pube conversation, no. Well, I'm trying to pivot away from pubes into something
[40:11.350 --> 40:15.630]  more pleasant. Have you guys seen this video? It's been out for a while. You probably have seen it.
[40:15.690 --> 40:22.850]  It's a guy who created something called the hot dog run and he took like a Hot Wheels car track
[40:22.850 --> 40:27.130]  from the second floor of his house and it goes all the way down to the first floor,
[40:27.130 --> 40:32.790]  then out the window. You can watch the video. And then it jumps up into the air and then the
[40:32.790 --> 40:37.870]  hot dog lands on a grill and they cook it. Wow. Basically, what they did was they took the hot
[40:37.870 --> 40:42.610]  dog and they put it on like Lego wheels, like stuck it on Lego wheels and then it just goes
[40:42.610 --> 40:49.490]  down this track. I thought that was so cool and so clever. It's awesome. It got me thinking,
[40:49.850 --> 40:54.710]  you know how they do, like when you're a kid, you do soapbox derby races like when I was in
[40:54.710 --> 40:57.410]  Cub Scouts. We would do it all the time. You get a little block of wood and then you have to turn it
[40:57.410 --> 41:04.290]  into a car. What if we did hot dog races where we put, we all get the same Lego, like regulation,
[41:04.430 --> 41:09.450]  Lego wheels and then we put our hot dog on it and then we can shape our hot dog or put attachments
[41:09.450 --> 41:14.650]  on it like Mr. Potato Head style to make it as aerodynamic as possible. And then we have hot
[41:14.650 --> 41:19.090]  dog races to see who's the fastest hot dog racer. And that's like a new sport we do. I love it. I
[41:19.090 --> 41:23.830]  like that a lot. I'm already thinking of the mods. Yeah, exactly right. You put a pair of wings on
[41:23.830 --> 41:29.810]  that sucker, it'll fly. And then at the end, we eat the hot dogs as the reward. That sounds great.
[41:31.090 --> 41:37.350]  I'm looking at this hot dog track and I'm imagining if Gavin's parents could bribe him
[41:37.350 --> 41:42.390]  with a curly straw to do his chores, if this was an option that he could have, the hot dog,
[41:42.510 --> 41:47.190]  like cooking a dog. I bet you his parents could get him to kill somebody. I bet you there's nothing
[41:47.190 --> 41:54.890]  Gavin would do for a hot dog launch. What if we put a loop in the track? And then Gavin can, like,
[41:54.950 --> 42:00.570]  it's the best of every wolf, Gav. Or what if we put a bunch of loops in and then like two heating
[42:00.570 --> 42:05.790]  elements and potentially it could get cooked on the roof. Oh, like on the way down. That's another
[42:05.790 --> 42:15.550]  great idea. There's so much we can do with this. Heated tracks, maybe? Like, what other race exists
[42:15.550 --> 42:22.710]  on Earth where at the end of the race they eat the car? Yeah, that's a great point. You know, like,
[42:22.850 --> 42:27.370]  the Fast and Furious movies, they love to jump from one car to another. There could be something
[42:27.370 --> 42:33.650]  where, like, a bun is moving at an equal speed and the dog has to launch somehow from the one to the
[42:33.650 --> 42:39.870]  bun. Could you make dueling tracks and put the bun down one track and the hot dog down the other,
[42:40.030 --> 42:45.070]  and then they jump and combine in the air? Oh, I'm also imagining, like, you know, in a car wash
[42:45.070 --> 42:49.450]  you get those spinning brushes. Uh-huh. I'm imagining one on each side, one with ketchup,
[42:49.590 --> 42:54.990]  one with mayo, and then one with mustard. Mustard? Yeah, like a mustard brush? That's a great idea.
[42:57.290 --> 43:02.230]  While we're, like, just living in this Willy Wonka world of hot dogs, what if, like, it launched on
[43:02.230 --> 43:08.350]  a slip and slide of ketchup or, like, other condiments? Oh, like, that's... like, with
[43:08.350 --> 43:13.130]  don't-need-wheels, you're just on the lube of mustard and mayo. Yeah, like, it launches off
[43:13.130 --> 43:20.410]  one thing and then... Like a luge, almost. Yes, yes. Yeah, I like this idea. Like, we have, like,
[43:20.450 --> 43:25.290]  the dry track and then we also have, like, it's like, you know, the theme park version or, like,
[43:25.310 --> 43:29.030]  the racetrack version, but then we also have, like, the Schlitterbahn version where you're
[43:29.030 --> 43:34.510]  going down... yeah, yeah, yeah, this is really good. Or, like, a Plinko for flavor. Like,
[43:34.510 --> 43:38.610]  there's different things you can bounce off of and different areas on the track have different
[43:38.610 --> 43:43.950]  condiments. Which flavors it hits on the way down. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. This is... we've...
[43:43.950 --> 43:50.090]  we've created, like, a whole theme park around hot dogs. This is awesome. Dude, deciding your
[43:50.090 --> 43:55.770]  flavor by Plinko is the... is the best idea you've ever had. That's a really low bar. That might be,
[43:55.790 --> 43:59.990]  like, up there with Geoff calling me Russell Hantz. I appreciate it. Oh, you think that's an
[44:00.710 --> 44:09.450]  Yeah, it's not great. Oh. What's not great? Saying that that's the best idea I've ever had. It's a
[44:09.450 --> 44:15.130]  fun idea. It's a great idea. Don't say yourself short. And also, don't be so negative to Russell
[44:15.130 --> 44:19.830]  Hantz. He changed the game by himself. Probably single-handedly more influential in Survivor than
[44:19.830 --> 44:24.650]  anybody else. I don't know about that, but also, like, he's scamming people in fantasy football
[44:24.650 --> 44:30.190]  leagues now. Like, he's not... not a good guy. No, I didn't say he was a good guy. I said he was
[44:30.190 --> 44:39.470]  an important guy. I think I'd rather be a good guy than an important guy. That's fair. I respect
[44:39.470 --> 44:43.250]  that too, but I... along with Gavin, I think it's a really... I think you're selling your own idea
[44:43.250 --> 44:48.010]  short. Yeah, I think it's a fantastic idea. What if... hmm... I'm really thinking about this now.
[44:48.650 --> 44:52.750]  You don't really get flavor for bouncing off bacon. I was thinking, like, the pegs could be,
[44:52.750 --> 44:58.410]  like, bacon wrap, but that doesn't really do anything. What could be a thing? What could we
[44:58.410 --> 45:06.090]  add to this? It can't just be condiment. There has to be a way to get, like, cheese potentially in
[45:06.090 --> 45:12.790]  the mix. Onion. Onion, yeah. It's classic hot dog. We'll have to do some... we'll have to do
[45:12.790 --> 45:17.040]  some testing. Eric, we're gonna need a lot of Hot Wheels tracks. We're gonna need some sort of a
[45:17.040 --> 45:23.720]  Plinko device. All right, yeah. We're gonna need a bunch of hot dogs. Some sort of a Plinko device.
[45:23.900 --> 45:28.180]  You got it. Once we do the face and leg board, you could just convert that to the Plinko board.
[45:28.840 --> 45:32.960]  Oh, yeah, it could be a part of the... it could be a component, yeah. Yeah, and then... do you
[45:32.960 --> 45:36.740]  think we could cook the hot dog as it goes down the device? Like... like we were going to do with
[45:36.740 --> 45:41.900]  the track? Like... like it heat... it gets heated down as it goes down the Plinko device? Yeah,
[45:41.940 --> 45:44.580]  I think we could fit... we could definitely warm it. I mean, that's all you're doing,
[45:44.580 --> 45:48.520]  isn't it, with a hot dog? That'd be an awesome restaurant to go to. You just, like,
[45:48.560 --> 45:52.940]  put in five dollars to order a hot dog, and then whatever comes down the Plinko device is the hot
[45:52.940 --> 45:59.660]  dog you get. I feel like that's a dangerous game. Well, not if you control the ingredients. Well,
[45:59.680 --> 46:03.680]  yeah, but you just said you couldn't, right? It'd be a random dog. Well, I mean, you control...
[46:03.680 --> 46:07.880]  well, I mean, you... you being us, the people that are inventing this device, we can control
[46:07.880 --> 46:11.560]  the ingredients we put in it. I also don't think you could be fussy if you're eating at this
[46:11.560 --> 46:16.260]  establishment. That's true. That's very true. Like, what kind of hot dog wouldn't you want?
[46:18.020 --> 46:23.940]  It's a relish. I don't want any relish on my dog. Yeah, I don't want fish. I mean,
[46:23.960 --> 46:30.000]  Geoff doesn't want mayo. I don't want mayo on my hot dog. Is there just gonna be fish in this
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.660]  machine? I don't know where fish came from for the hot dog thing, but all right. Yeah, I mean,
[46:34.760 --> 46:40.640]  hey guys, I'll make my solemn vow. No fish. Thank you. I wouldn't want an oyster on my hot dog,
[46:40.640 --> 46:43.860]  but I just don't know why that would be on it. You're acting like this is a ridiculous thing.
[46:44.020 --> 46:50.340]  Gravel? I don't want gravel on my hot dog. Nick just showed us Fatburger. Fish hot dog
[46:50.340 --> 46:57.420]  feels like a product they sell in the dark room. Oh, Nick's insane dark sandwich or whatever.
[46:58.660 --> 47:07.180]  I mean, are there fish dogs? Yeah. Oh, you know what would be good? There are. Surrounding a hot
[47:07.180 --> 47:14.080]  dog and onion rings. So it's a thing. It's a thing in a place called Wienerschnitzel and they call
[47:14.080 --> 47:20.840]  it the sea dog. And it is a Garrett Hunter from Mega64 is the only person that I know that gets
[47:20.840 --> 47:28.140]  this and he gets it every time. Not ironically. No, he loves this thing. It is. It's like a big
[47:28.140 --> 47:33.260]  ash. It's like a big like fish stick thing, but they put it in a hot dog bun with hot dog condiments
[47:33.260 --> 47:39.780]  and everything. It's like a fish hot dog. Yeah. Here's one called a sea dog. Yeah, the sea dog.
[47:39.900 --> 47:45.140]  That's what he gets. He gets the dog. He's an insane person. He's crazy. Yeah, I don't want that.
[47:46.260 --> 47:53.220]  Again, my solemn vow is no fish. That looks like you just said something that looks like
[47:53.220 --> 47:59.480]  Nick made it in the dark again. Yeah, I did. But I had that thought. Has food ever looked more like
[47:59.480 --> 48:06.560]  sex than that? Oh, yeah. That's sex in a bun. Dude, that's my kind of sex, too. That is.
[48:07.120 --> 48:10.420]  That was good. Those onion rings are you pre-wax?
[48:14.720 --> 48:18.600]  Yeah, that's unfortunate, but I would definitely eat that.
[48:19.300 --> 48:23.960]  So you would prefer it instead of the shredded cheese melted on top of the hot dog that's
[48:23.960 --> 48:33.560]  currently fucking the onion rings? You would prefer like a solid slap of cheese on top of
[48:33.560 --> 48:38.400]  that? I would. Okay, that's fair. But I think there's definitely an opportunity for the hot
[48:38.400 --> 48:43.180]  wheels track to have the whole thing go through an onion ring. Oh, I think it's a great idea.
[48:43.700 --> 48:49.980]  That's a great idea. So we have a lot to work with here. We have a lot of directions we can go,
[48:49.980 --> 48:58.040]  the least of which, the bare minimum is that we race hot dogs. And then we can get very creative
[48:58.040 --> 49:03.480]  from there in terms of how we turn those hot dogs into food and if we plinko them. But I really feel
[49:03.480 --> 49:09.880]  like that's some solid supplemental content potential there. I'm very excited. Eric, is this
[49:10.300 --> 49:14.240]  delegatable? Or do you think you'll have to handle this yourself? Oh, no, this is delegatable for
[49:14.240 --> 49:19.700]  sure. Gracie's already taking notes, so we're good. Excellent. I wonder if you could fire a hot dog
[49:19.700 --> 49:27.080]  out of a blow gun. Oh, definitely. I've got a gun that would fire a hot dog. You have a hot dog gun?
[49:27.440 --> 49:33.280]  Well, I got an air cannon that is probably the diameter of a hot dog. That's... oh, you gotta
[49:33.280 --> 49:40.180]  try that. Could you shoot it into my mouth? I think it comes out like 400 miles an hour.
[49:40.660 --> 49:48.640]  So what if I stand really far back? Oh, well, we should definitely do this. You know what I mean?
[49:48.640 --> 49:54.080]  If I stand far enough back, we'll lose velocity by the time it gets there. What if you put the
[49:54.080 --> 49:59.960]  bun in your mouth as a crash pad for the dog? I think that's a great idea. How far could we
[49:59.960 --> 50:08.500]  send a dog, do you think? At 400 miles an hour? Could we send it over stage four? Oh. Oh, yeah.
[50:08.580 --> 50:14.460]  Yeah. And then you either catch it in your mouth, or maybe we catch it in a bun.
[50:14.460 --> 50:19.140]  Yeah. Or put the bun in my mouth and catch it. Either way, I'm prepared to do this.
[50:20.020 --> 50:23.920]  What about if you have an onion ring in your mouth and I'll fire it through that?
[50:24.100 --> 50:28.640]  Okay. Over stage four. I think, boys, I think we might be ushering in
[50:29.220 --> 50:36.100]  the era of the hot dog podcast. I think there's some solid potential there. I mean,
[50:36.120 --> 50:39.520]  we were sandwiches last week. Well, we haven't even made that sandwich yet. We need to do that.
[50:39.600 --> 50:41.960]  That's another great piece of supplemental. Man, we're racking up the supplemental.
[50:41.960 --> 50:45.580]  I was going to mention that we still need to watch that Blast movie and do a watch.
[50:45.920 --> 50:50.620]  Yeah. We're going to do that. I feel like we really need to watch Stay Tuned as well,
[50:50.700 --> 50:53.700]  now that we mentioned it in the previous episode. Oh, definitely. I just feel like
[50:53.700 --> 50:57.620]  we're really getting into our engineering phase. Yeah. Maybe it's an engineering podcast.
[50:59.080 --> 51:03.540]  I'm trying to engineer my head how you could do like a catcher's mitt with hot dog buns
[51:04.220 --> 51:07.480]  as like the way to try to catch the dog that's been launched.
[51:08.280 --> 51:13.900]  Oh, I'm sure we could do that. Like a finger in each bun? Like, how does that...
[51:14.480 --> 51:15.760]  Wait, so your fingers are the dogs?
[51:17.100 --> 51:20.780]  Like, you have to catch it with your hand, which is a hot dog bun.
[51:24.190 --> 51:27.350]  I'm trying to... I don't know how to make this work, but there's something there.
[51:27.810 --> 51:33.590]  Yeah, we'll figure it. We got a lot of potential here. The fucking hot dog options are endless,
[51:33.770 --> 51:38.590]  man. I mainly, to be honest, just want to see you get hit in the face with a hot dog at a high
[51:38.590 --> 51:43.550]  speed. Like, that alone is hilarious. I'm down for that, but I mostly just want to beat you guys in
[51:43.550 --> 51:50.330]  a hot dog race. I will let you beat me in countless hot dog races if it means that you get hit in the
[51:50.330 --> 51:54.250]  face with a hot dog that's launched from a cannon. Can I bring my compressed air cannon to the hot
[51:54.250 --> 52:03.270]  dog race? Yeah, of course. As long as I get to eat a hot dog, I'm happy. I would love just a profile
[52:03.270 --> 52:09.730]  shot, a little bit of slo-mo, of Geoff's hot dog on wheels just going from left to right, and then
[52:09.730 --> 52:22.550]  my hot dog just goes sailing over the top. I'm... When I think of, like, the most menacing characters
[52:22.550 --> 52:28.290]  in film history, I think of Anton Chigurh and his fucking air canister that he'd walk around and
[52:28.290 --> 52:33.450]  things with. Imagining he's launching hot dogs out of that thing is so funny to me.
[52:33.690 --> 52:36.870]  Just holding a hot dog to a guy's forehead. Just blasting it through.
[52:42.590 --> 52:47.930]  He blows out the door, the doorknob or whatever, and then a fucking hot dog goes through the hole.
[52:56.970 --> 53:01.930]  I'm gonna need to get my hot dog cannon to a more portable size, I think.
[53:05.970 --> 53:12.590]  Oh, this is awesome. Yeah, oh god, great episode. We need more time to, like, do all this. We need
[53:12.590 --> 53:17.170]  some office days. That's what I say to Geoff. I think we need to add a second office day for
[53:17.170 --> 53:21.650]  Let's Play and Supplemental. Yeah, I think Andrew's right. I mean, here it is right now. We
[53:21.650 --> 53:28.730]  have two watch-alongs. We have a whole cavalcade of hot dog related content to do. We have eating
[53:28.730 --> 53:36.170]  sandwiches in the dark. We have two drafts, at least, that we could do. There's a lot to film.
[53:36.910 --> 53:41.010]  Oh, this is exciting. It's great. It's just in time for you to be unavailable for
[53:42.870 --> 53:48.110]  a week and a half, two weeks? Just a week and a half. Oh, just a week and a half, okay.
[53:48.370 --> 53:51.890]  Just a week and a half. That's good. Well, we can do some Supplemental next week, the beginning of
[53:51.890 --> 53:56.710]  next week. What are you doing Tuesday? What are we up to? Tuesday afternoon, I'm getting, like,
[53:59.270 --> 54:03.350]  my beard and stuff ready, trimmed up for the wedding, but I can do anything Thursday morning
[54:03.350 --> 54:09.610]  or day. I said the afternoon, dude. Oh. So, I have the morning in it. I have up till, like,
[54:09.610 --> 54:14.190]  2 p.m. that I'm free to throw hot dogs or... I mean, hot dogs aren't really a breakfast food,
[54:14.270 --> 54:17.850]  but, I mean, we can try, I guess. Whatever. We could do butthole in the morning. Yeah,
[54:17.910 --> 54:20.290]  I could do butthole in the morning and beard in the afternoon. That sounds great. I'm trying.
[54:20.430 --> 54:25.810]  I'm trying to get this person to... And then sandwiches at night. Yeah. Yeah. And then
[54:25.810 --> 54:34.850]  sandwiches at night. I only eat my tomatoes in the dark. What do you not like about just a nice
[54:34.850 --> 54:44.190]  slice of tomato? It's too liquidy, too juicy. I understand. But then ketchup is... So liquidy.
[54:44.610 --> 54:50.990]  Yeah, but it's sugary. Oh, add salt to it from Nick. Good suggestion. Oh, yeah. It's sweet.
[54:51.010 --> 54:56.210]  Well, Andrew, let me make this solemn promise to you. Throughout the duration of our... the
[54:56.210 --> 55:02.450]  remaining duration of our friendship, which I hope is long and fruitful, I promise to eat all of your
[55:02.450 --> 55:09.170]  tomatoes. Anytime you get a tomato that you don't want, you just... Oh, okay. I thought you're
[55:09.170 --> 55:13.730]  like enlisting me to start growing tomatoes. No, no, no. I'm just saying like if we're ever hanging
[55:13.730 --> 55:18.150]  out and you get a tomato on your regulation sandwich and you want to unregulate it, I'll eat
[55:18.150 --> 55:21.670]  that. I'll take that tomato bullet for you. I mean, you don't have to. You're welcome. I'm happy
[55:21.670 --> 55:26.010]  to, dude. I love tomatoes and I don't want to see tomatoes waste. I could eat them like an apple. Dude,
[55:26.090 --> 55:30.670]  I already... Well, first off, I already called dibs on his tomatoes. And B, you can eat a tomato like
[55:30.670 --> 55:37.010]  an apple while I'm eating a turnip root like a turnip root. That's another piece of supplemental
[55:37.010 --> 55:42.670]  content. We got to eat apples and turnip or tomatoes and turnip roots. What happened to the fruit throw?
[55:44.490 --> 55:49.950]  It's a round, right? Okay. I don't... I think... I don't know. I just don't know what won.
[55:50.830 --> 55:58.310]  Oh, I'm curious. Oh, yeah. I've just been busy editing my actual work. Yeah, that's more than
[55:58.310 --> 56:03.970]  fair. I should have a free bit of time at the weekend, so I could just whip that up. I also
[56:03.970 --> 56:08.250]  want to do the Jackhammer video. Oh, I'm very excited about that. A lot of supplemental coming
[56:08.250 --> 56:12.770]  your way. A lot of good stuff. You can support us directly by going to f***facepod.com slash first
[56:12.770 --> 56:18.950]  and signing up. That's how you sell that. That's... and now people know. Tomatoes... I always just think
[56:18.950 --> 56:25.170]  of TPG when I think of tomatoes. And I want to share a text that he sent me. He was talking to
[56:25.170 --> 56:30.190]  me about Jack... he was talking to me about Reacher, the show, asking me if I watched it.
[56:30.630 --> 56:40.550]  And this was his text. His little review. Can you read that out loud, Gavin?
[56:48.310 --> 56:49.190]  Fuegismo show.
[56:51.830 --> 56:55.450]  It's like a cheesy 80 action movie. It's a show. Machete fights, Desert Eagles,
[56:55.950 --> 56:59.490]  babes, the whole joint. But Fuegismo...
[57:01.610 --> 57:06.790]  Is that meant to be like Fuegismo or like Fuegismo is the intent? I don't know. Either way,
[57:06.830 --> 57:10.910]  I've never seen that word. And I just loved it. And I just want to start using it for everything.
[57:11.250 --> 57:12.810]  I love it. Fuegismo.
[57:19.240 --> 57:22.520]  But now I'm going to watch Reacher. I think this episode was Fuegismo.
[57:22.520 --> 57:27.620]  We came up with a lot of hot dog stuff. Andrew's been in a bathtub the whole time.
[57:28.280 --> 57:32.020]  I'm so cozy. I have a great way to end it.
[57:32.240 --> 57:36.380]  OK. This is something I've been wanting to ask you guys for a long time. And I think I've actually
[57:36.380 --> 57:42.000]  asked Eric off camera during other podcasts. But oh, and we should even talk. Andrew,
[57:42.080 --> 57:45.680]  you and I had an idea to revolutionize spoons that we can get into next week.
[57:45.920 --> 57:51.300]  But we had a whole conversation this morning about how to revolutionize the spoon industry.
[57:51.300 --> 57:55.100]  You can't leave us on that cliffhanger. Oh, no, we have to leave it on. I love that
[57:55.100 --> 58:03.840]  cliffhanger. Wow. Here's my question for y'all. What if you had an intro song?
[58:04.640 --> 58:07.960]  What would it be? Like, for instance, any time you walked into a room,
[58:08.120 --> 58:13.080]  like you walk into Rooster Teeth to go to work for a supplemental day or for an office day.
[58:13.140 --> 58:17.040]  And when you walk into the office, the new office, which exists now and that I've been
[58:17.040 --> 58:22.280]  a lot of time in and I love, you walk in, it's playing a song to introduce that you're there.
[58:22.460 --> 58:27.320]  What is your intro song? I don't have a good one for me. I have a good one for Johnny Caviar.
[58:27.860 --> 58:30.560]  What's Johnny Caviar's? Wasn't Me by Shaggy.
[58:31.700 --> 58:40.540]  Nice. That's perfect. Like, you think about it like... I don't know if it... In this scenario,
[58:40.880 --> 58:45.680]  my head, it magically plays in the background. But it would be funny if your friends had to
[58:45.680 --> 58:51.200]  hum it or sing it to you when they saw you at the first time. But I feel like I know dead set
[58:51.200 --> 58:54.980]  what mine would be. But Eric, I think you had one when we talked. What was your intro song?
[58:56.020 --> 59:02.500]  My song would be Bad to the Bone. This is even better if... So I just love the riff at the
[59:02.500 --> 59:08.720]  beginning. And now I'm thinking if it plays wherever I'm at, cool. If it doesn't and you
[59:08.720 --> 59:17.720]  have to sing it to me, even better. If I walk into a room and it goes... Awesome. Fucking great.
[59:18.560 --> 59:23.040]  I think that is the perfect intro song for you. That is the vibe when Eric walks into a room.
[59:23.560 --> 59:31.340]  Gavin, what the fuck is this? Give that a little listen. All right. Let's listen to this real fast.
[59:33.620 --> 59:37.080]  Oh, wow. Can we play this on the episode?
[59:40.060 --> 59:43.880]  I guess. Yeah, you know what? We're talking over it. Let's just do it.
[59:44.660 --> 59:45.960]  It is quite regal. Oh, you on the countdown?
[59:47.320 --> 59:53.180]  They're counting down. What is this? This is Blobby? This is Mr. Blobby, right?
[59:57.350 --> 01:00:02.590]  Wow. The fuck? It really gets going after like 20 seconds. Yes, it does.
[01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:09.390]  Oh, I don't like this. This is what I imagine how Gavin's inner monologue works.
[01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:17.690]  Oh, no, they sing. Yeah, that was actually, I think, like a number one.
[01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:29.690]  In what? In what? Yeah, number one in what? Like the number one song in England. Oh, no.
[01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:38.930]  Christmas number one. Oh, no. Top, top the charts. Yeah, I want to come into that. I think that is
[01:00:39.310 --> 01:00:44.690]  that is the perfect, the perfect song for you, Gavin. Psycho, psycho shit. Like I'm already
[01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:47.830]  imagining what my arms are going to be doing as I'm walking down the corridor.
[01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:55.510]  Dude, I love it. I think I think Eric nailed his. I think you've nailed yours. I think
[01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:58.470]  Johnny Caviar's makes a ton of sense. Do you have any idea for one, Nick?
[01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:05.890]  Okay. Nick is gone. Nick heard that this song went to number one and fucking passed out.
[01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:11.090]  He caught a case of Gavin. Yeah. Sorry, I was getting into the lyrics there.
[01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:19.030]  Okay, still doesn't. What's your answer? What the fuck is going on in this? What's happening?
[01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:24.730]  Guys, 182 of these, not difficult. Don't know what's happening in this one.
[01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:27.730]  It's not hard for me.
[01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:32.970]  What's going on?
[01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:39.830]  This sucks.
[01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:48.630]  You missed the question and we're all just like, well, well.
[01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:57.490]  I'm so upset. Nick's intro song, Eric, Nick's intro song would just,
[01:01:57.730 --> 01:01:59.990]  it would just be Beetlejuice going, who, me?
[01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.510]  Yeah.
[01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:11.170]  What the fuck? I don't know. I don't know if mine, I was pretty happy with mine. I think mine
[01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:16.490]  like perfectly summarizes me, but I don't know if it's as good as Gavin's fits him,
[01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:22.530]  but this would be mine. It would be in the summertime by Jerry. Yeah, that's great.
[01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:23.930]  Let me play some of this.
[01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:44.970]  That's one of those songs that like is such a fun, lighthearted summer vibe. And then you
[01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:48.830]  listen to the lyrics and it's so much darker than you. Terrible lyrics. Yeah. Don't pay it.
[01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:51.910]  Don't pay attention to the lyrics. The lyrics are not great, but the vibe is
[01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:56.250]  awesome. I've never paid attention to the lyrics. You don't need to. Oh, they're bad.
[01:02:56.910 --> 01:03:02.190]  It's a great song. Good pick. I want to film us all walk into the building.
[01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:06.930]  With our, yeah, right? Yep. Yeah, because we'd all have a little different jaunt.
[01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:10.490]  Yeah, I like that. That's another piece of supplemental.
[01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:15.310]  Well, we need to keep making it to stick our wax face on the front of.
[01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:20.450]  We need to put, I'm going to say this too. If Nick doesn't come up with one in about eight
[01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:23.050]  seconds, we're going to come up with one for him. No, don't do it.
[01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:26.190]  Gracie said no one asked, but mine would be Margaritaville.
[01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:30.410]  Oh, that's a great pick. I feel like mine would be Sultans of Swing.
[01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:33.050]  Oh, that's a good one. I love that song.
[01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:38.790]  All right. Sultans of Swing. That's a great song. Margaritaville is a fantastic song,
[01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:44.430]  Gracie. It definitely, you know, Gracie, did you know that Margaritaville was written in Austin,
[01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:50.430]  Texas? I didn't. Yeah. Did you know we went to the Margaritaville in Key West and it was like,
[01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:57.330]  having a panic attack, but surrounded by fake parrots. Oh my God. That place was insane. Loudest
[01:03:57.330 --> 01:04:03.430]  place I've ever been on Earth. Absolutely. They're awesome. 100%. Absolutely insane. But yeah,
[01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:10.370]  Jimmy Buffett apparently wrote Wastin' Away in Margaritaville at a bar restaurant on Anderson
[01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:17.450]  that's no longer there. And then he was having like a goodbye breakfast before he went to the
[01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:22.510]  airport and flew back to Key West and then finished it there. So that's our local connection
[01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:28.830]  to Margaritaville. When he died, the duplex that he had stayed in when he wrote the Margaritaville
[01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:35.050]  song, I guess is known. And a bunch of people came and put salt and salt shakers in front of
[01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:41.230]  the duplex as like a door, like Jim Morrison style homage to him. Man, we didn't even get to a
[01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:45.730]  Halloween night. Oh yeah, that's right. Well, that'll be, that'll have to be next time because
[01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:50.790]  we got to wrap this thing up for sure. Next time will be middle of December. I don't think we'll
[01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:56.350]  probably get to it. All right, we'll get to it next October. We hung out for Halloween and it
[01:04:56.350 --> 01:05:03.310]  was fun. There you go. Well, it was almost a disaster. Burndog saved some kid's life. Yeah,
[01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:09.730]  but we have to save it for the next episode. Andrew, what happened? Oh, what happened?
[01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:17.110]  What? Is he drowning? Andrew, what happened? Are you there?
[01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:25.450]  Andrew? Did he drop his laptop in the water? No.
[01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:37.490]  I think maybe he listened to Summertime by Mungo Jerry and got too excited.
[01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:47.930]  Andrew? Oh God, no. We'll be on the lookout for a text from Andrew in the next 10 minutes.
[01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:54.470]  He was recording on that though, wasn't he? He sure was. I hope he doesn't... Did he drown his
[01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:59.750]  audio? Did he approve, did he say, did he give approval that if he died in this episode that we
[01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:03.730]  could still play it? Oh, that's right. I forgot about that. I think he did. Yeah, I did. Yeah,
[01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:09.490]  he was implied. It was implied. Yeah, I think it was implied. Okay. Well, thanks for listening to
[01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:16.270]  another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. This was the Terk 182 edition. Hopefully Andrew is still
[01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:21.830]  alive and with us. Andrew? I'm still here. What happened? I was trying to just, it's getting a
[01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:25.410]  little cold in here, so I went to turn the hot water on. I accidentally hit the shower button.
[01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:36.630]  I got blasted. Oh God. You got a soggy mic? Oh no, I threw everything away from me. I'm drenched.
[01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:44.330]  I don't know what, I got to throw my blanket in the dryer. It's a bad scene.
[01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:54.810]  And this thing, this is insane. Oh man, tell a friend about this podcast, please, won't you?
[01:06:56.090 --> 01:07:00.970]  Or I'm going to tell a friend about you. Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look
[01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:06.290]  at next week's episode of F*** Face. He wouldn't do that, would he? Who has the sloppy mouth?
[01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:11.330]  Do it for Elon. Going the distance in the bathroom. What's the best Halloween costume?
[01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:17.030]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil. All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
