[00:00.000 --> 00:01.240]  Hey guys, producer Eric here.
[00:01.340 --> 00:03.860]  Just want to run down some supplemental content for you.
[00:03.980 --> 00:08.060]  So check this out over on our YouTube channel and over in f***facepod.com.
[00:08.100 --> 00:10.560]  You can go watch the second bean hole video,
[00:10.700 --> 00:15.000]  but that's not it because through December we have supplemental content for you.
[00:15.220 --> 00:18.700]  You can check out the Christmas movie draft that's over there.
[00:18.760 --> 00:22.940]  So is the Christmas music draft. That's all the stuff that's come out so far,
[00:23.040 --> 00:28.380]  but pretty soon we have the Christmas catalog of 98 browse through where we go
[00:28.380 --> 00:31.700]  through a cool Christmas catalog of 98. Check out some cool toys.
[00:31.880 --> 00:36.620]  It is very long, so prepare for that one. We also have the waxing video.
[00:36.880 --> 00:37.300]  That's right.
[00:37.360 --> 00:42.800]  The waxing has occurred and you will see the video of it on December the 30th
[00:42.800 --> 00:46.120]  and to bring you into the new year, as promised,
[00:46.280 --> 00:48.960]  we have two fruit throw videos,
[00:49.280 --> 00:54.380]  the true fruit throw video and then the fruit throw video with Andrew's
[00:54.380 --> 00:54.820]  commentary.
[00:55.360 --> 00:59.180]  And that's all coming your way on our YouTube channel and at facepod.com.
[00:59.240 --> 01:01.080]  But enough of that stuff. Let's get to the show.
[01:11.500 --> 01:13.620]  This will be episode 185 by the way.
[01:13.740 --> 01:17.260]  And I have something written down that says talk about will wheel of years.
[01:17.760 --> 01:22.860]  So that's just a note before we get going. Let's talk about wheel of years.
[01:22.960 --> 01:26.340]  But you guys want to see something cool? Of course. Feet, feet, feet.
[01:29.040 --> 01:32.280]  It worked. Holy shit. Holy fuck.
[01:32.800 --> 01:36.140]  Eric has unlocked the secret of how
[01:37.240 --> 01:42.100]  to summon Gavin whenever he wants to. It's worked two times now.
[01:43.000 --> 01:43.440]  Yeah.
[01:43.620 --> 01:47.280]  Is this the thing that you always talk about after I get hit or like,
[01:47.640 --> 01:48.920]  I don't know what you're talking about. What?
[01:52.500 --> 01:54.380]  Is this the thing you were talking about last time?
[01:54.820 --> 01:56.160]  You know, Gavin, how,
[01:56.460 --> 02:00.940]  you know how Columbus tricked a tribe of people because he knew an eclipse was
[02:00.940 --> 02:04.800]  coming and they didn't. And he leveraged that. Like you just knew.
[02:05.080 --> 02:08.780]  So they thought he had powers. Eric has done that with your being on time.
[02:09.540 --> 02:12.940]  Eric has a power over you that we didn't understand.
[02:13.500 --> 02:15.620]  Oh yeah? Well, let's see if he has that power next week.
[02:17.520 --> 02:20.040]  I'm not worried. I've been, I've been two for two with it.
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.620]  I might just retire on top. Retire at two? Okay. Yeah. I mean, maybe.
[02:24.740 --> 02:27.880]  Who knows? Honestly, let's see who remembers next week.
[02:31.380 --> 02:33.780]  Uh, but this is episode 185. Geoff, do the intro.
[02:34.200 --> 02:37.840]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[02:38.360 --> 02:42.940]  This is episode 185. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always,
[02:43.060 --> 02:46.080]  Andrew Payton and Gavin Free. Hello boys.
[02:46.360 --> 02:48.420]  Which was the one that we're meant to have?
[02:49.200 --> 02:51.500]  Is it 187 that was going to be the best episode of all time?
[02:51.640 --> 02:53.300]  We did this last week. No, that's the Merc episode.
[02:53.400 --> 02:56.860]  What are we talking about? It's like 196. 196? Wait, what?
[02:56.960 --> 02:58.000]  Are we in a time loop?
[02:58.520 --> 03:03.120]  This is, isn't this how literally last week's episode started? Am I insane?
[03:03.540 --> 03:05.540]  No, you're absolutely correct. Yeah.
[03:05.780 --> 03:08.960]  With Gavin asking the question. You literally did the exact same thing last week.
[03:09.060 --> 03:11.560]  And Eric did the... What is going on?
[03:11.660 --> 03:14.660]  How do you think I lock it in? Because it's not sticking. Make it stick.
[03:14.680 --> 03:17.860]  I don't know. So anyway, we'll see who remembers our thing for next week.
[03:17.960 --> 03:18.840]  Oh my God.
[03:21.520 --> 03:26.700]  I'll be honest. My, uh, I can hear myself slightly delayed in my headphones
[03:26.700 --> 03:29.460]  and I'm barely able to speak. I don't know what's going on.
[03:29.760 --> 03:31.700]  Are you like that lady on that newscast?
[03:32.740 --> 03:34.980]  Oh, the Tipped Derritson thing?
[03:35.540 --> 03:38.460]  Yeah. Pertation. Pertation? Damn. Pertation.
[03:39.320 --> 03:41.320]  Do you need to, uh, do you need to fix it?
[03:41.560 --> 03:43.660]  I mean, you can like, you can step out and fix it and stuff.
[03:43.780 --> 03:47.260]  You can step out. Yeah. I'll figure it out. Just, uh, I'll just tell...
[03:47.780 --> 03:49.520]  All right, man. We'll see you later. Okay. Yeah.
[03:49.560 --> 03:51.600]  We'll talk to you later, Gavin. We'll keep going here.
[03:51.820 --> 03:53.300]  If you, if you figure it out, you can come back.
[03:55.980 --> 04:02.140]  Speaking of figuring it out, uh, I'm proud to say Chuck's has been working lately a little bit.
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.020]  Yeah? Yeah, we played till like 2 a.m. last night. It only crashed twice.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.440]  But dude, in four hours? That's pretty fucking good for me.
[04:12.140 --> 04:14.480]  Sometimes they crash nine times in 30 minutes.
[04:14.720 --> 04:18.840]  That's actually incredible. Yeah. Yeah. Two nights in a row. It's been like real smooth.
[04:19.460 --> 04:22.820]  That game is good and that's the worst part because I was having fun.
[04:22.820 --> 04:28.180]  I tried to play some trucks to just get, get my grips on it and I was having a good time.
[04:28.620 --> 04:32.720]  And then I was in the middle of a mission and I was on the last part and it just crashed on me.
[04:33.180 --> 04:38.840]  And I was confronted with, do I want to give my heart to this thing that Geoff has in the way that he has?
[04:39.260 --> 04:42.860]  Knowing the pain and that this is going to constantly happen.
[04:43.060 --> 04:47.220]  And I don't think I can do it. I think I'm going to pop in and out in trucks and have fun when I'm there.
[04:47.260 --> 04:49.600]  But I can't commit. But you're out for now? Because I'm crashing.
[04:50.120 --> 04:51.740]  So here's the nice thing about it.
[04:51.800 --> 04:55.560]  We've developed workarounds so that it minimizes the fuckery.
[04:56.120 --> 05:00.180]  So we only play in Antonio's trucks on Antonio's map.
[05:00.320 --> 05:04.840]  That way, if I get kicked or Burndog gets kicked or if either you play and you get kicked,
[05:05.360 --> 05:08.920]  the truck and the items stay exactly where they were when you got kicked.
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.380]  So you just come back in and you pick up where you left off.
[05:11.560 --> 05:16.660]  You just have to give up on the idea of using your own vehicles, which is totally, totally fine because they're all the same anyway.
[05:17.460 --> 05:20.200]  OK. It's just a progression thing.
[05:20.580 --> 05:21.600]  Have you ever played single player?
[05:21.700 --> 05:23.920]  Do you know if it crashes as much in the single player mode?
[05:24.060 --> 05:26.500]  It does not. I've played. I play single player sometimes.
[05:27.260 --> 05:30.800]  Like like if I have like 30 minutes to kill, I'll knock out a mission here and there.
[05:30.880 --> 05:32.840]  It's only crashed on you once in single player.
[05:33.480 --> 05:35.380]  Oh, wow. Yeah. Maybe you'll look at that.
[05:36.220 --> 05:38.860]  Gavin, do you think we should partner up in the franchises
[05:39.280 --> 05:42.760]  since we're doing, you know, new episode, new material, any restaurants?
[05:44.060 --> 05:45.540]  So melting pot, right?
[05:46.280 --> 05:48.080]  Yes. Yes. The melting pot.
[05:48.800 --> 05:52.820]  It was a mistake to attempt to buy a melting pot.
[05:52.960 --> 05:54.680]  Let me tell you. And I don't know.
[05:55.080 --> 05:56.080]  Oh, do you have an update?
[05:56.660 --> 05:59.260]  Oh, I've got I got 25 updates.
[05:59.360 --> 06:03.380]  I've been getting emails from the melting pot every day
[06:04.200 --> 06:05.840]  about you should get this franchise.
[06:06.440 --> 06:11.960]  And I haven't been reading them for the most part because they're kind of
[06:11.960 --> 06:14.260]  they're they're bracketed in a weird way.
[06:14.680 --> 06:15.700]  Do you think you could get them down?
[06:15.800 --> 06:19.160]  Because 500,000 is a really, really round number.
[06:19.940 --> 06:23.600]  Well, I maybe I didn't consider that as an option
[06:23.600 --> 06:27.020]  because I don't want a melting pot and you also don't want one,
[06:27.260 --> 06:29.700]  which is the weirdest part about this whole thing.
[06:31.100 --> 06:33.060]  Just as a reminder, I said
[06:33.760 --> 06:38.180]  I put in a fictional city as to where I wanted one said
[06:38.180 --> 06:41.700]  I didn't have the money, didn't know anyone that did.
[06:41.960 --> 06:45.940]  And I've only done this because a friend told me that it was a good idea.
[06:46.100 --> 06:49.380]  And I've been getting all these emails and I noticed
[06:50.280 --> 06:53.360]  one of them said, like, I'd love to call you next week
[06:53.360 --> 06:56.160]  so we can have a talk about this opportunity.
[06:56.500 --> 06:58.620]  And I thought they surely are not going to call.
[06:58.760 --> 07:01.580]  But but they did, in fact, did call.
[07:02.320 --> 07:04.000]  And I did not answer.
[07:04.420 --> 07:05.380]  Oh, come on.
[07:06.400 --> 07:10.560]  But I have a voicemail from them that I can try to play.
[07:10.560 --> 07:14.940]  The speaker on my phone is not the best, but I'll play a voice.
[07:15.020 --> 07:18.460]  You're going to play a corporate voicemail from someone unbeknownst to them.
[07:18.500 --> 07:19.740]  Yeah. From the melting pot.
[07:19.980 --> 07:21.760]  Just do a voice change on it.
[07:22.600 --> 07:23.880]  Yeah. Nick will fix it in post.
[07:24.120 --> 07:26.720]  Yeah. Just do a voice change.
[07:26.840 --> 07:29.320]  Just put just press the voice change button.
[07:29.460 --> 07:30.460]  How about this? How about this?
[07:30.520 --> 07:33.540]  We'll have Jack re-perform the voicemail.
[07:33.960 --> 07:35.680]  Why can't we use the voicemail?
[07:35.880 --> 07:37.460]  Well, because there's no consent. I don't know.
[07:37.980 --> 07:39.920]  Yeah, you probably need consent from this person.
[07:39.920 --> 07:41.880]  I mean, it just I don't it's to me.
[07:41.980 --> 07:46.300]  It's less even consent and more like we're really hammering the melting pot.
[07:46.380 --> 07:48.320]  And this person is just doing their job.
[07:48.980 --> 07:53.200]  Yeah, that too. I like the idea of Jack re-enactment.
[07:54.340 --> 07:57.280]  Right. But that's going to be so much work for everyone to try to get Jack
[07:57.280 --> 07:58.300]  to do something, isn't it?
[07:59.000 --> 08:00.560]  You get someone who's easier to get.
[08:01.180 --> 08:04.300]  Hey, Andrew, this is Alan over at Melting Pot Franchising.
[08:04.480 --> 08:07.380]  I saw that you sent over an inquiry not too recently.
[08:07.380 --> 08:10.540]  I wanted to reach out and talk to you about opportunities we see.
[08:11.240 --> 08:13.480]  Feel free to give me a call back if you're interested in learning
[08:13.480 --> 08:15.640]  about the process and becoming a franchise owner yourself.
[08:15.880 --> 08:20.400]  I'm available at ****** or my cell phone ******.
[08:22.580 --> 08:25.300]  Thank you so much, and I look forward to talking to you. Bye bye.
[08:26.320 --> 08:28.440]  Yeah, we'll definitely cut out the phone numbers.
[08:29.080 --> 08:30.360]  Yeah, the phone numbers can't be on.
[08:31.580 --> 08:35.620]  I'm going to tell you right now, just based on that phone call,
[08:35.680 --> 08:36.740]  that guy will not like you.
[08:36.740 --> 08:41.400]  No. Well, he texted me as well.
[08:41.820 --> 08:43.020]  They gagged for it.
[08:43.740 --> 08:47.060]  After that, and he's really good at his job.
[08:47.760 --> 08:52.660]  He said, Hi, Andrew, this is blank blank at Melting Pot.
[08:53.080 --> 08:56.920]  What about Nanaimo makes you think a melting pot would flourish there?
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.600]  Was the question to which I replied.
[08:59.760 --> 09:02.760]  I personally don't think Nanaimo would be a good location,
[09:02.820 --> 09:05.020]  but my friend Gavin thinks we should get one.
[09:05.020 --> 09:07.220]  The hurdle is we don't have any money.
[09:08.520 --> 09:14.200]  There were a building or building or plans or really a want to.
[09:14.340 --> 09:18.440]  I mean, there's a lot of hurdles, but yeah, their reply to that was, I see.
[09:18.960 --> 09:22.640]  Well, I have a partnership matchmaking program where I can place you
[09:22.640 --> 09:27.100]  with someone who would be interested in finding operators for a new build.
[09:27.560 --> 09:29.520]  Would you want to discuss that opportunity?
[09:30.040 --> 09:32.260]  And I replied, No, thank you.
[09:32.260 --> 09:34.020]  Oh, come on.
[09:34.400 --> 09:39.780]  Andrew is going to accidentally open a melting pot store.
[09:40.220 --> 09:45.000]  You are you are on the cusp of doing the funniest thing.
[09:45.100 --> 09:46.960]  What happened to the yes and?
[09:47.580 --> 09:51.540]  Well, no, it's you can yes and you can fill out your own application
[09:51.540 --> 09:53.060]  if you if you really want to.
[09:53.140 --> 09:54.140]  I'm already on yours now.
[09:54.700 --> 09:57.480]  Oh, that's Andrew, you're on the cusp of ownership.
[09:57.840 --> 09:59.280]  No, it's over. I've said no.
[09:59.340 --> 10:01.440]  Thank you. And his response was heard.
[10:01.440 --> 10:03.120]  Thank you for your interest.
[10:04.480 --> 10:06.980]  You should reply. I had absolutely no interest.
[10:07.760 --> 10:09.300]  No, I said, thank you.
[10:09.380 --> 10:13.080]  But you could respond with, I've had second thoughts.
[10:13.580 --> 10:15.460]  I could later. Yeah.
[10:15.540 --> 10:18.320]  But this is once again, this is just a man doing his job.
[10:18.420 --> 10:19.020]  So I don't want to.
[10:19.900 --> 10:22.980]  I feel like we follow this thing through its natural end.
[10:23.060 --> 10:24.480]  I don't want to just mess with this person.
[10:29.280 --> 10:32.480]  I'm messing with other people is what's happening.
[10:33.360 --> 10:35.620]  Nick's Nick is making me laugh in the discord.
[10:35.920 --> 10:38.440]  You should just respond with you, son of a bitch.
[10:38.580 --> 10:39.340]  I'm back in.
[10:42.700 --> 10:44.580]  I'd love to, but I don't want to.
[10:44.860 --> 10:48.320]  He's going to place you with somebody who's got the seed money.
[10:48.480 --> 10:52.040]  But I don't want I'm scared of that accidentally happening.
[10:52.040 --> 10:54.320]  Are you worried that he works on commission?
[10:55.920 --> 10:58.900]  What? Well, he probably gets paid no matter what happens with you.
[10:59.540 --> 11:01.500]  Yeah, but I'm wasting his time.
[11:01.860 --> 11:03.200]  What are you afraid of? Success?
[11:03.640 --> 11:08.140]  Are you afraid of being a busy businessman who owns his own melting pot?
[11:08.240 --> 11:10.420]  And by the way, probably gets to eat there for free.
[11:10.920 --> 11:13.400]  Are you scared of getting an invoice for five hundred thousand dollars?
[11:14.500 --> 11:17.720]  Oh, we just get the air card if that happened.
[11:17.920 --> 11:20.420]  But we certainly wouldn't. Absolutely not.
[11:20.640 --> 11:21.100]  What do you mean?
[11:21.100 --> 11:24.420]  I'm not paying an invoice for five hundred thousand dollars.
[11:24.560 --> 11:25.760]  It's a good point.
[11:25.820 --> 11:27.540]  That should be the case. It's not for the show.
[11:27.560 --> 11:28.480]  It's for Andrew.
[11:28.940 --> 11:33.280]  No, no. No, but it is for the show because Andrew's for the show.
[11:33.440 --> 11:36.140]  Yeah, but I think what Eric's getting at is he doesn't do that stuff anymore.
[11:36.220 --> 11:37.260]  He has great to do it.
[11:37.380 --> 11:39.740]  So I think what he's trying to say is Gracie.
[11:39.900 --> 11:41.720]  Oh, yeah. There you go. See, Gracie's got the car.
[11:41.800 --> 11:43.620]  Yes, he loves to get a great car.
[11:43.680 --> 11:46.140]  The last thing Gracie ever purchased
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.720]  is a five hundred thousand dollar melting pot.
[11:49.720 --> 11:51.280]  Gracie, how do you feel about fondue?
[11:51.820 --> 11:53.960]  Liquid cheese is my favorite thing, so I'm in.
[11:54.360 --> 11:56.020]  OK, there we go. We got it.
[11:56.260 --> 11:59.900]  I'm going to reply to Colin later tonight and let him know,
[12:00.040 --> 12:02.060]  even though I blanked his name before. This is not good.
[12:03.260 --> 12:04.980]  I got an investor,
[12:06.340 --> 12:08.100]  but we're going to...
[12:08.100 --> 12:10.860]  What if you just send him the 16 digits from the card?
[12:11.240 --> 12:13.280]  She's an associate producer.
[12:13.680 --> 12:15.480]  Can we put this on credit?
[12:16.060 --> 12:18.840]  She's about to be producing melting pots is what she's going to be producing.
[12:18.840 --> 12:20.420]  Can we? Can we?
[12:20.520 --> 12:23.660]  I know it's a franchise, but can we get a permission to rename it
[12:23.660 --> 12:24.880]  a regulation melting pot?
[12:25.200 --> 12:27.100]  Oh, these are all great questions.
[12:27.140 --> 12:28.740]  I feel like that'll help us stand out.
[12:29.380 --> 12:30.760]  Because you guys really want it.
[12:30.820 --> 12:35.300]  I'll do at least one more text in this town and we'll see what happens.
[12:35.300 --> 12:39.240]  But I really don't want to continue to pester unless he's open to it.
[12:39.280 --> 12:40.180]  If he has fun.
[12:40.280 --> 12:43.340]  You said that this guy would not like me, Geoff, which makes me think
[12:43.340 --> 12:44.320]  we should not do this.
[12:44.740 --> 12:46.480]  But no, yeah, he doesn't like he already doesn't like you.
[12:46.480 --> 12:50.600]  Before even the text, I could tell by his voice, he didn't swing the tone.
[12:50.720 --> 12:52.820]  You guys would not hang out.
[12:53.260 --> 12:55.020]  No, maybe, maybe not.
[12:55.040 --> 12:57.000]  This would have happened if they put a little bit of space
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.880]  between their book a reservation and buy a restaurant on the website.
[13:01.780 --> 13:03.000]  I forgot about that.
[13:03.300 --> 13:06.400]  I forgot why this even started to get how we ended up down this little spiral.
[13:09.580 --> 13:10.460]  Oh, God.
[13:11.480 --> 13:14.700]  I I woke up to a great email the other day,
[13:14.700 --> 13:17.800]  which is that I was more than willing to mess with.
[13:18.200 --> 13:21.980]  I woke up to a like eight email chain
[13:22.580 --> 13:26.720]  for a thing related to the stinky dragon.
[13:27.340 --> 13:31.320]  And it was the strangest first email where it was like,
[13:31.480 --> 13:35.200]  you've agreed to do this work and it needs to be sent in by Tuesday.
[13:35.620 --> 13:37.740]  What is your rate for doing this?
[13:38.100 --> 13:39.860]  And it was for PNGs.
[13:40.220 --> 13:42.120]  And I was like, what is going on?
[13:42.120 --> 13:43.300]  How did I didn't agree?
[13:43.500 --> 13:45.660]  What PNG is a photo, right?
[13:45.680 --> 13:46.780]  I think that's an image thing.
[13:47.240 --> 13:48.980]  Why am I expected to do photo?
[13:49.060 --> 13:52.680]  And so I'm trying to like read up and down the chain
[13:53.200 --> 13:56.940]  of like when this was pitched, because I never got the pitch email.
[13:57.120 --> 13:59.840]  Like this is clearly at the end of the thing to wrap it up.
[14:00.120 --> 14:01.120]  And I'm reading that.
[14:01.200 --> 14:05.080]  And then Blaine is giving additional instructions to me
[14:05.080 --> 14:08.680]  as a side thing that's following up is like, Andrew, when you do this,
[14:08.880 --> 14:11.600]  we really want this type of style to it.
[14:11.600 --> 14:13.560]  And I'm completely baffled.
[14:13.760 --> 14:17.680]  And then I realized, oh, this is this is somebody.
[14:17.940 --> 14:19.840]  There are multiple Andrews at the company.
[14:20.020 --> 14:23.980]  There's also somebody who is Andrew Douglas, which is my middle name.
[14:24.240 --> 14:26.180]  There's a second Andrew Douglas.
[14:26.560 --> 14:31.560]  And I got accidentally roped in on the final chain of this email
[14:31.560 --> 14:34.480]  of them finalizing the contract for them doing this work.
[14:35.180 --> 14:39.740]  They they emailed Andrew Panton thinking that he's my old roommate
[14:39.740 --> 14:43.940]  and friend, Andrew Douglas, who does the art for Stinky Dragon.
[14:44.880 --> 14:46.940]  Nobody stopped to check.
[14:47.380 --> 14:52.620]  They just kept emailing Andrew Panton going, draw this stuff.
[14:52.700 --> 14:53.420]  What are you doing?
[14:54.140 --> 14:56.860]  Well, what was weird is I wish that was the case
[14:56.860 --> 14:58.640]  because I would have understood what was going on.
[14:58.980 --> 15:00.560]  They had sent it the right way.
[15:00.680 --> 15:02.660]  Ninety five percent of the way.
[15:03.140 --> 15:06.540]  And then on the one yard line just threw my email in
[15:06.540 --> 15:08.460]  when asking what the rate would be.
[15:08.460 --> 15:09.540]  So did you get it done?
[15:09.900 --> 15:10.820]  Well, here's the thing.
[15:10.920 --> 15:11.920]  I was very confused.
[15:12.460 --> 15:16.120]  I would have quoted a very aggressive rate if I were you.
[15:16.380 --> 15:19.860]  Well, I it went through a process of first panic
[15:19.860 --> 15:23.200]  that I was expected to do this work that I didn't understand what it was
[15:23.200 --> 15:25.060]  and that it was due the next day.
[15:25.240 --> 15:29.360]  Then just confusion for what the actual task was
[15:29.360 --> 15:30.740]  that I was supposed to be doing.
[15:31.020 --> 15:33.320]  Then I understood what happened.
[15:33.840 --> 15:37.420]  And I said that I'd be willing to do the work for six times
[15:37.420 --> 15:40.260]  whatever the other Andrew Douglas was asking for,
[15:40.360 --> 15:42.380]  but it would be 10,000 times worse.
[15:43.080 --> 15:46.400]  And they did not take me as a serious negotiator.
[15:46.540 --> 15:49.420]  I also said that any further negotiations would be have to
[15:49.420 --> 15:52.700]  would have to go through Johnny.Caviar at RoosterTeeth.com
[15:53.300 --> 15:54.520]  Smart. That's smart.
[15:54.620 --> 15:56.340]  They did. They did not follow through on that either.
[15:56.620 --> 16:01.180]  To be clear, I just want everyone to know like Andrew draws like this stuff.
[16:01.200 --> 16:03.000]  It's like here's a cat, a crazy bird man.
[16:03.120 --> 16:05.960]  And they're just emailing in Japan and going, this got to get done tomorrow.
[16:05.960 --> 16:07.700]  And it's this is what a mess.
[16:07.860 --> 16:08.640]  What a mess.
[16:09.620 --> 16:14.020]  I was tempted to attempt to draw things for based on the guideline,
[16:14.180 --> 16:16.160]  but it would be too bad.
[16:16.960 --> 16:17.800]  Dude, you should have.
[16:17.920 --> 16:19.840]  That would have been funny just to turn your work in.
[16:20.740 --> 16:22.460]  Maybe I will. Maybe I can turn it.
[16:22.500 --> 16:24.900]  It would have been funny, except it would have pushed them up
[16:24.900 --> 16:27.120]  against some sort of a deadline that would have totally fucked them.
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.560]  They're probably already fucked.
[16:29.660 --> 16:32.500]  They wasted a day emailing Andrew Shanton going this.
[16:32.600 --> 16:34.260]  You have to get this done tomorrow, Andrew.
[16:34.260 --> 16:35.920]  Yeah, they already sent it to the wrong Andrew.
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.320]  I feel like you should throw in, throw in some work just to help him out.
[16:39.620 --> 16:43.840]  Do you think maybe I should like throw in some work and be like, hey,
[16:43.920 --> 16:46.980]  just, you know, in the future, I know this is a mistake, but, you know,
[16:47.200 --> 16:50.280]  if you ever need a guy, if you ever need a guy looking straight up,
[16:50.360 --> 16:52.260]  you should attach your artwork along with the invoice.
[16:52.600 --> 16:53.760]  OK, I'll do that.
[16:53.820 --> 16:58.320]  How about is do you have any other Andrew Douglas pieces, Eric?
[16:58.840 --> 17:00.020]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[17:00.040 --> 17:02.700]  Can you send me like three and I'll recreate them
[17:02.700 --> 17:05.940]  and then I can show them to you guys what I send them.
[17:06.120 --> 17:08.380]  OK, hang on. OK, we're going to I'm going to send you.
[17:08.500 --> 17:10.080]  You can recreate. So there's that.
[17:10.260 --> 17:11.080]  That's from Stinky Dragon.
[17:11.180 --> 17:12.320]  I want to give you some of his portfolio.
[17:12.640 --> 17:13.520]  So it's a cat. Yeah.
[17:13.640 --> 17:15.220]  And a bird man.
[17:15.840 --> 17:18.040]  Here's his here's his Twitter avatar.
[17:19.580 --> 17:23.840]  OK, that's like it's like a it's like a green man
[17:23.840 --> 17:27.780]  with a big tongue, big eyes, horns and a baseball cap.
[17:28.100 --> 17:30.220]  So that so there's that zombie guy.
[17:30.220 --> 17:33.440]  Uh huh. And then let's see what else?
[17:33.880 --> 17:35.100]  I actually feel good about that one.
[17:35.140 --> 17:37.820]  I think I could do I think I could do that one.
[17:38.120 --> 17:40.820]  OK, and then here's here's one that I think you can do.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.540]  Also, this is more of his sketchy sort of stuff
[17:44.560 --> 17:47.600]  where he's sort of deteriorating, become a skeleton man.
[17:47.680 --> 17:50.140]  And he says, that's it. I'm officially hangry.
[17:50.460 --> 17:51.820]  OK, got it.
[17:52.200 --> 17:53.920]  That one's there's not even color in that.
[17:54.040 --> 17:54.640]  No, no, no, no.
[17:54.640 --> 17:57.780]  A lot of his stuff is mostly black and white stuff, and I really like it.
[17:57.980 --> 17:59.560]  And yeah, it's great. It looks great.
[17:59.560 --> 18:01.380]  Yeah, he does. He does really, really good.
[18:01.520 --> 18:05.400]  So you follow up at Angie Moto, A-N-G-I-M-O-T-O
[18:05.400 --> 18:06.380]  if you want to check out his stuff.
[18:06.440 --> 18:08.660]  He did all this stuff for Good Morning from Hell also.
[18:09.200 --> 18:12.200]  And then he just naturally folded over into this.
[18:12.280 --> 18:13.260]  He's just maybe an artist.
[18:13.600 --> 18:16.400]  Maybe you could reimagine Ian as a skull.
[18:17.780 --> 18:19.160]  Yeah, I like that idea.
[18:20.200 --> 18:24.060]  He here's one where he drew me yelling at him to press the X button.
[18:27.680 --> 18:30.220]  While we're doing the Andrew commercial,
[18:30.460 --> 18:33.900]  should we also mention that he helped pick up home runs when we were hitting the balls?
[18:33.920 --> 18:39.160]  He did, yeah. He was there shagging balls for us when Geoff was hitting dingers.
[18:39.440 --> 18:40.960]  Yeah, he was doing what to him?
[18:41.880 --> 18:42.780]  He was fucking the baseballs.
[18:42.920 --> 18:46.500]  You're British. He was fucking baseballs while Geoff was hitting them with a baseball bat.
[18:46.500 --> 18:47.960]  Sorry, I didn't mean to confuse you, man.
[18:48.640 --> 18:51.020]  I like that panel of all the X buttons from all the consoles.
[18:51.020 --> 18:53.540]  Yeah, that is that's me.
[18:53.680 --> 18:55.320]  That's an actual thing where we were playing.
[18:55.460 --> 18:57.100]  He was playing Zelda. I was watching him.
[18:57.260 --> 18:58.900]  And then he's like, I don't know how to beat this guy.
[18:59.080 --> 19:05.180]  And that's me yelling at him to press X and him and him stressing the fuck out.
[19:05.440 --> 19:06.660]  He's the only guy.
[19:07.120 --> 19:10.800]  He's the only guy that I've met that doesn't like NFL Red Zone.
[19:11.360 --> 19:14.160]  He told me it's too many games, man.
[19:14.320 --> 19:15.560]  It stresses me out.
[19:17.340 --> 19:18.560]  It is all the games.
[19:18.780 --> 19:19.500]  It's just that, right.
[19:19.500 --> 19:20.840]  But that's the point.
[19:21.500 --> 19:24.400]  Too much of something does freak me out, too.
[19:25.480 --> 19:27.120]  That's why he doesn't like forests.
[19:27.600 --> 19:28.440]  Too many trees.
[19:28.920 --> 19:32.420]  Oh, I get really anxious.
[19:32.760 --> 19:35.900]  And it makes me kind of want to vomit when if I'm like on Google Maps
[19:35.900 --> 19:41.040]  and I zoom in to the middle of nowhere and like find a school or something.
[19:41.380 --> 19:44.380]  And I'm just like, how would it how would I ever find this again?
[19:44.600 --> 19:48.860]  And the fact that the earth is so big and I could get lost on the map
[19:48.860 --> 19:52.260]  from my own office, it just freaks me out, makes me want to throw up.
[19:53.200 --> 19:56.740]  You've created, but you've created all the stress in this scenario.
[19:57.040 --> 19:59.620]  All of the anxiety is manufactured by you.
[20:00.120 --> 20:01.120]  It just makes me uneasy, I don't know why.
[20:01.120 --> 20:02.300]  You never need to find that school again.
[20:02.580 --> 20:03.540]  It doesn't matter.
[20:03.820 --> 20:06.460]  The location of the school is completely irrelevant to your life.
[20:06.640 --> 20:08.140]  You don't need to worry about that.
[20:08.420 --> 20:11.380]  And then I start thinking about how long it would take me to get there
[20:11.380 --> 20:12.780]  if I really had to get there right now.
[20:12.940 --> 20:13.740]  It'd be probably days.
[20:14.180 --> 20:14.980]  That's insane.
[20:15.380 --> 20:16.560]  I can kind of relate.
[20:16.560 --> 20:18.760]  Do you foresee needing to get there?
[20:19.340 --> 20:20.820]  No. Well, I hope not.
[20:21.640 --> 20:25.180]  I have dreams where I will be like I'm trying to get home
[20:25.180 --> 20:29.140]  and then I'll get lost or like go on the wrong boat and I'll go,
[20:29.220 --> 20:30.700]  oh, fuck, now how am I?
[20:30.980 --> 20:32.960]  This is going to take so much longer to get home.
[20:33.080 --> 20:35.440]  And then I'll realize, oh, wait, I'm I'm sleeping.
[20:35.560 --> 20:36.740]  I'm in my bed sleeping.
[20:37.100 --> 20:38.760]  If I just wake up, I'm home.
[20:38.860 --> 20:42.740]  And then I wake up and go, fuck, yeah, immediate, immediately back.
[20:43.020 --> 20:44.280]  So I kind of understand.
[20:44.280 --> 20:46.880]  But. It's a strange thing.
[20:47.280 --> 20:48.920]  I don't know why you're worried about this school.
[20:49.560 --> 20:50.880]  I'm going to I'm going to try and find it again.
[20:51.100 --> 20:54.920]  You should. It's a little weird that you're obsessed with a school, but.
[20:55.400 --> 20:56.340]  It was just what I found.
[20:57.520 --> 21:00.420]  OK, but you seem to really want to go there is the issue.
[21:01.040 --> 21:02.100]  What are you looking to learn?
[21:02.880 --> 21:05.000]  Oh, Gavin is sharing his screen.
[21:05.460 --> 21:06.700]  We're going to Earth.
[21:07.040 --> 21:09.720]  So I think I remember where it was, but it really freaked me out.
[21:09.820 --> 21:10.880]  Like, let me know if this freaks you out.
[21:10.880 --> 21:13.700]  There's a school and it's like.
[21:14.100 --> 21:16.320]  So we're zooming into the earth right now.
[21:16.700 --> 21:21.020]  Yeah. And I think it's like, oh, boy, this is just water.
[21:21.600 --> 21:22.460]  It appears.
[21:26.140 --> 21:27.600]  What is going on?
[21:27.760 --> 21:28.820]  OK, we're zooming in.
[21:29.280 --> 21:33.380]  This is like the intro credits into a Tony Scott movie.
[21:33.560 --> 21:34.820]  Oh, this is absolutely.
[21:34.980 --> 21:36.740]  Jason Bourne is about to pop up.
[21:36.860 --> 21:37.760]  I'm very excited.
[21:38.280 --> 21:38.960]  But like what?
[21:39.680 --> 21:41.640]  But look, let's just show in the middle of nowhere.
[21:41.640 --> 21:43.540]  Look, imagine going in there.
[21:43.720 --> 21:44.160]  No.
[21:45.240 --> 21:46.280]  That's crazy.
[21:46.860 --> 21:48.480]  Nick, Nick, it's too big.
[21:48.580 --> 21:49.540]  The world's too big.
[21:49.880 --> 21:51.080]  Nick is going, no.
[21:51.700 --> 21:55.520]  What is it, an active school?
[21:55.900 --> 21:57.440]  I don't know anything about this school.
[21:57.520 --> 21:58.400]  It just freaked me out.
[22:00.020 --> 22:01.360]  Oh, my God.
[22:01.380 --> 22:02.120]  You're insane.
[22:04.160 --> 22:05.900]  It's so weird.
[22:07.600 --> 22:11.220]  Gavin has been getting weirder and weirder
[22:11.220 --> 22:14.900]  as the episodes go on for the last like this fall.
[22:15.100 --> 22:19.240]  It's been like it's been like odd Gavin fall.
[22:19.780 --> 22:21.020]  Oh, my God.
[22:21.380 --> 22:24.780]  Do you just zoom into a random places like Google Maps go?
[22:24.920 --> 22:25.860]  Oh, it's a building.
[22:26.180 --> 22:27.400]  It's a warehouse.
[22:27.860 --> 22:30.220]  Andrew, that's almost exactly what happens.
[22:31.080 --> 22:32.640]  I don't understand.
[22:33.740 --> 22:34.940]  Well, stop.
[22:35.020 --> 22:36.480]  It's clearly freaking you out.
[22:37.400 --> 22:39.120]  Why do you continue to do it?
[22:39.120 --> 22:41.220]  What are you gaining from this experience?
[22:42.760 --> 22:43.140]  I don't know.
[22:43.220 --> 22:46.380]  I'm interested in geography, but it's scary out there.
[22:46.400 --> 22:48.200]  Well, just don't zoom in.
[22:48.460 --> 22:49.580]  Just stay at a distance.
[22:50.880 --> 22:53.060]  But it's it's scary out there.
[22:53.160 --> 22:54.020]  You're not out there.
[22:54.100 --> 22:55.560]  You're so safe in here.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.220]  Yeah, I just get really thankful afterwards.
[22:58.400 --> 22:59.280]  I'm just like, phew.
[23:01.500 --> 23:04.540]  Thank God you didn't have to go to a school in the middle of nowhere, huh?
[23:05.180 --> 23:08.120]  Yeah, like what if what about when you're flying and like you're
[23:08.120 --> 23:12.680]  you look out the window and you see like things that you might not place?
[23:13.280 --> 23:14.520]  Well, like a turkey sandwich by that.
[23:15.160 --> 23:17.080]  Well, yeah, like a turkey sandwich is a good one.
[23:17.320 --> 23:23.520]  Or like I know when I fly to Arizona, you see like a lot of just random
[23:23.520 --> 23:26.500]  industrial type buildings in the desert.
[23:26.540 --> 23:27.780]  And I always think that's interesting.
[23:27.980 --> 23:30.140]  I think about who works there and they're scary.
[23:30.380 --> 23:34.400]  I always I always think of how soft everything looks
[23:34.400 --> 23:37.100]  and how it's not really soft and it bums me out.
[23:38.840 --> 23:42.320]  From an airplane, green stuff looks like if you like, oh, I just roll around
[23:42.320 --> 23:43.680]  and that'd be like fucking super soft.
[23:43.760 --> 23:45.240]  But it's not it's not really soft.
[23:45.340 --> 23:46.780]  It's super hard and pokey.
[23:48.160 --> 23:49.220]  I wonder why.
[23:49.340 --> 23:51.060]  Is it because you know where that is?
[23:51.840 --> 23:54.440]  Like when you're flying, like it feels like you could recreate
[23:54.440 --> 23:55.900]  your ability to get back there.
[23:55.980 --> 23:59.500]  I'm curious what aspect of this is actually your anxiety.
[24:00.620 --> 24:02.200]  What are you afraid of?
[24:02.740 --> 24:03.580]  It's the zooming.
[24:04.060 --> 24:06.760]  Like when you're on a plane, there's no zoom factor.
[24:06.760 --> 24:12.800]  So if you had binoculars and you were on a plane and you could zoom in,
[24:12.860 --> 24:14.000]  it would get really scary.
[24:14.420 --> 24:16.040]  No, I think it's more zooming out that scares me.
[24:16.820 --> 24:20.400]  Oh, it's the feeling of insignificance and small.
[24:20.820 --> 24:22.700]  Yeah, just feeling all tiny.
[24:23.400 --> 24:25.020]  We're getting to your rational point of thought.
[24:25.140 --> 24:26.440]  That feels understandable to me.
[24:27.320 --> 24:29.140]  You have like when you look up at the stars.
[24:29.320 --> 24:30.500]  Yeah, I understand. Yeah.
[24:31.280 --> 24:33.360]  So you look into the stars to me is less scary.
[24:34.040 --> 24:34.400]  Really?
[24:34.740 --> 24:37.880]  So it's because I can't because I don't have any equipment to look deeper.
[24:38.560 --> 24:40.080]  Sounds to me like you need a telescope.
[24:40.700 --> 24:42.020]  Yeah, that would freak me out probably.
[24:42.600 --> 24:42.960]  It would.
[24:44.620 --> 24:45.400]  Don't you have?
[24:45.580 --> 24:47.060]  I thought I thought you had a telescope.
[24:48.180 --> 24:50.200]  He definitely has. He's Mr. Science.
[24:50.400 --> 24:51.300]  He's going to have a lens somewhere.
[24:51.320 --> 24:53.680]  Didn't we do the whole thing and you went through and like we made fun of you
[24:53.680 --> 24:56.380]  for liking telescopes or something like the catalog?
[24:56.880 --> 24:57.200]  Yeah.
[24:57.560 --> 25:00.920]  If you look at something in a microscope, do you freak out when you back out?
[25:00.920 --> 25:03.500]  Oh, yeah, I can go too deep on a microscope, too.
[25:04.020 --> 25:04.920]  And that bothers you.
[25:05.280 --> 25:06.720]  Yeah, it's something about.
[25:06.900 --> 25:08.240]  Yeah, it's just something about the zoom.
[25:08.300 --> 25:09.140]  I think zooming.
[25:09.380 --> 25:12.360]  Have you ever seen those the Mandelbrot set?
[25:12.540 --> 25:14.760]  It's like a weird, like mathematical pattern.
[25:14.860 --> 25:16.280]  And it is like infinitely zooms.
[25:16.520 --> 25:18.340]  It honestly makes me want to throw up.
[25:19.580 --> 25:23.680]  Like those videos, like those illusion videos, what are you talking about?
[25:23.920 --> 25:25.660]  No, it's it's nerd shit.
[25:29.100 --> 25:30.620]  I was trying to relate.
[25:30.620 --> 25:34.600]  I've seen those like weird art type videos where it's constantly gives you
[25:34.600 --> 25:36.660]  the effect of zooming and it loops.
[25:37.100 --> 25:39.600]  Don't do that. I would kill him if you watch that.
[25:41.480 --> 25:43.780]  Can you imagine that'd be the worst thing ever for you, Gavin,
[25:43.840 --> 25:47.340]  if you were stuck in a constant zoom out and you could never escape?
[25:47.680 --> 25:48.940]  You just kept zooming out forever.
[25:49.080 --> 25:50.800]  Well, yeah, that's that's OK. So that's what this is.
[25:51.180 --> 25:51.820]  Don't look at it.
[25:52.200 --> 25:54.080]  Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
[25:54.300 --> 25:57.620]  I start to think like, OK, well, I start to try and track where I am
[25:57.620 --> 25:58.660]  as it zooms in.
[25:58.760 --> 26:00.680]  I'm like, OK, so it went in and then it zoomed up to the right.
[26:00.960 --> 26:03.640]  And then it just gets to be too much information where I'm just like, man,
[26:03.640 --> 26:05.680]  if I lost something here, I would never find it again.
[26:06.040 --> 26:07.020]  And that idea freaks me out.
[26:07.120 --> 26:11.000]  If anyone wants to watch this, it's called the hardest trip
[26:11.520 --> 26:13.360]  and brought fractal zoom.
[26:13.800 --> 26:17.600]  And it's just and it's just sort of what like visually
[26:17.600 --> 26:19.840]  it's sort of what it's like to be on mushrooms.
[26:21.420 --> 26:23.260]  I really appreciate Gavin's.
[26:23.320 --> 26:26.300]  It just keeps going like that should be on the front of the box.
[26:26.300 --> 26:30.420]  I like skipping through the video and seeing where it is
[26:30.420 --> 26:32.620]  and going, I wonder how it got there. It's pretty exciting.
[26:34.860 --> 26:37.980]  OK, so don't never have you zoom in or zoom out.
[26:38.740 --> 26:42.480]  Anything that makes you realize things are a lot vaster or smaller,
[26:42.600 --> 26:43.320]  you do not like.
[26:44.880 --> 26:47.200]  Yeah, I want to just be my size.
[26:52.730 --> 26:56.830]  Now, is there any aspect about your current size that you wish was smaller?
[26:58.690 --> 27:00.270]  Oh, I've been thinking about this.
[27:00.270 --> 27:01.770]  I wish I had smaller feet.
[27:02.410 --> 27:05.250]  I see only positives to having tiny feet.
[27:05.690 --> 27:07.390]  Nobody's asking you to pick nose.
[27:07.550 --> 27:10.190]  Yeah, your nose is a defining feature on you. It's lovely.
[27:11.810 --> 27:13.230]  Yeah, that was not a set up.
[27:13.290 --> 27:13.750]  I'm just curious.
[27:13.910 --> 27:17.050]  I've been genuinely thinking about, man, life would be better with small feet.
[27:17.470 --> 27:19.510]  I will. Do you like trip over your feet because they're too big?
[27:19.950 --> 27:23.690]  No, I was looking at I have 11 size 11 feet,
[27:24.230 --> 27:25.390]  which are not like massive.
[27:25.650 --> 27:28.690]  But the issue is when you when there's like a cool sneaker,
[27:28.690 --> 27:31.730]  it's always sold out and like the common sizes.
[27:31.950 --> 27:36.370]  But then there's a million that are in like the size six, seven,
[27:36.970 --> 27:38.210]  eight kind of range.
[27:39.070 --> 27:42.470]  Yeah, and I just don't see a disadvantage to having small feet.
[27:43.490 --> 27:47.130]  It is that you have like the most common shoe size and it's the fucking worst.
[27:47.210 --> 27:48.890]  I wear a ten and a half. Same kind of thing.
[27:49.270 --> 27:50.950]  A lot of places don't make half sizes anyway.
[27:51.190 --> 27:54.770]  And so it's just it's always a fucking cramming into a ten or an eleven
[27:54.770 --> 27:56.670]  or getting lucky and finding a ten and a half
[27:56.670 --> 27:58.490]  when everybody else is looking for a ten and a half.
[27:58.490 --> 27:59.170]  It sucks, dude.
[27:59.970 --> 28:03.950]  It does. And I just don't feel like there's a small foot insecurity.
[28:04.150 --> 28:05.230]  Like, I don't think anyone cares.
[28:05.730 --> 28:07.150]  I only see it as a positive.
[28:07.490 --> 28:08.790]  Nobody's like, look at that guy's feet.
[28:08.890 --> 28:11.110]  They're fucking tiny. How embarrassing.
[28:11.810 --> 28:13.330]  Yeah, I mean, what are you, a size eight?
[28:13.770 --> 28:16.790]  Unless you're at like Disney and you're wearing sandals.
[28:17.150 --> 28:19.470]  And well, then you go like, well, look at those feet.
[28:19.510 --> 28:20.210]  They don't look human.
[28:20.750 --> 28:21.790]  That's yeah, that's true.
[28:22.010 --> 28:22.630]  That's different.
[28:23.250 --> 28:23.950]  It wasn't the size.
[28:24.110 --> 28:27.470]  I'm not I'm not saying like a baby foot, just a small, a tiny foot.
[28:27.470 --> 28:28.770]  Like I got tiny hands.
[28:28.870 --> 28:29.870]  I wish my hands.
[28:30.190 --> 28:34.570]  I if I could swap and have larger hands and tinier feet.
[28:34.710 --> 28:35.550]  That's the dream body.
[28:35.870 --> 28:37.050]  That's the adjustment I need.
[28:38.110 --> 28:40.870]  So. Wait, what is that?
[28:41.190 --> 28:46.610]  Larger hands and I'm saying that's the dream body.
[28:46.890 --> 28:50.770]  I'm saying for me, if we were optimizing my body,
[28:51.010 --> 28:56.570]  if you could, because I have tiny hands, but I have average to slightly big feet.
[28:56.570 --> 29:02.890]  If I could swap my feet and make my hands be average to slightly big
[29:02.890 --> 29:06.610]  and my feet be tiny, that's me in my optimal form.
[29:07.050 --> 29:09.650]  Do you want to be able to hold your own foot in the palm of your hand?
[29:09.730 --> 29:11.210]  Like when you touch a baby's foot?
[29:12.850 --> 29:13.610]  I don't.
[29:14.070 --> 29:16.350]  Well, with your big, big hands, you might be able to, you know.
[29:16.990 --> 29:19.530]  But I don't want freakishly large hands.
[29:19.590 --> 29:21.630]  I just want big hands.
[29:21.810 --> 29:25.250]  But you're happy with your extra long back and the size of your head.
[29:25.250 --> 29:29.710]  Yeah, that's just more stuff added to like the description to draw.
[29:29.790 --> 29:32.530]  Andrew is just like big feet, small hands.
[29:32.570 --> 29:35.070]  But then when you draw dream, Andrew, everything's the same.
[29:35.210 --> 29:37.110]  But it's big hands, small feet.
[29:37.350 --> 29:40.510]  So are you like Uncle Jack and it's always sunny with your hands?
[29:41.430 --> 29:43.210]  I don't remember Uncle Jack's.
[29:43.430 --> 29:46.050]  He he was the lawyer who had tiny hands and he was always trying to.
[29:46.150 --> 29:48.490]  Yeah. And yeah, I'm not trying to hide them.
[29:48.590 --> 29:50.110]  But Donald Trump, the ex-president.
[29:50.670 --> 29:51.490]  Yeah. Interesting.
[29:51.570 --> 29:54.210]  Once again, though, he pretends they're huge or whatever, right?
[29:54.210 --> 29:56.070]  I got to say, I've seen your hands.
[29:56.250 --> 29:59.850]  I feel like a lot over the course of knowing you and they seem totally fine to me.
[30:00.010 --> 30:00.710]  They're just small.
[30:00.870 --> 30:03.670]  I feel like Geoff has strong opinions on people's hands.
[30:04.150 --> 30:05.650]  He's like a real hand noticer.
[30:06.530 --> 30:08.630]  I don't notice anyone's hands ever.
[30:08.810 --> 30:10.170]  Is that something you lock in on, Geoff?
[30:10.830 --> 30:13.450]  I didn't realize it until this moment, but maybe Gavin's right.
[30:13.570 --> 30:14.690]  I never considered it.
[30:15.050 --> 30:17.650]  I've just been around you where you comment on other people's hands.
[30:18.170 --> 30:20.430]  Huh? I don't. Yeah, I could see that.
[30:20.470 --> 30:21.650]  I'm pretty judgmental in general.
[30:26.970 --> 30:27.930]  Oh, man.
[30:30.250 --> 30:33.370]  Did anybody have anything they wanted to talk about this week other than hands and feet?
[30:33.950 --> 30:38.130]  I have to talk about that video you sent of Eric dancing.
[30:42.280 --> 30:45.100]  It's it's I've watched it ten times.
[30:45.300 --> 30:47.260]  It's phenomenal. It's amazing.
[30:47.440 --> 30:51.340]  I think it's the contrast because you've got you've got like Alyssa on the side.
[30:51.420 --> 30:53.860]  She's just cutting some shapes. Looking good.
[30:53.860 --> 30:57.660]  You got Eric's small wife who's just moving majestically like
[30:58.280 --> 31:00.640]  like she's a genie coming out the end of a lamp.
[31:00.800 --> 31:05.220]  And then you've got Eric who seems to rotate between every type of puppet.
[31:05.480 --> 31:10.060]  Like he goes from like marionette and then suddenly he's got like rods coming from below.
[31:10.120 --> 31:17.140]  It's like absolutely the weirdest contrast of different dances.
[31:17.180 --> 31:20.100]  It's like Jim. It's like Jim Carrey in Fun with Dick and Jane.
[31:20.460 --> 31:21.680]  It's like I'm a real boy.
[31:24.800 --> 31:26.480]  I can't get over it.
[31:26.740 --> 31:29.940]  When that video got sent to me, I watched it 20 times, probably.
[31:30.980 --> 31:31.920]  Yeah. Who took it?
[31:32.680 --> 31:34.660]  I don't know. I honestly don't know.
[31:34.820 --> 31:36.540]  Really? I assumed you did.
[31:37.060 --> 31:39.020]  No, no, I didn't know.
[31:39.520 --> 31:43.940]  I gave you I gave you the only note or media I took at the wedding,
[31:44.040 --> 31:46.380]  which was that Nick is a Nick really likes to dance.
[31:46.480 --> 31:47.080]  Oh, yeah.
[31:47.980 --> 31:49.480]  I didn't find out about that.
[31:49.740 --> 31:52.740]  I didn't know that Eric danced at the wedding until like three or four days later
[31:52.740 --> 31:54.400]  when the video when I got sent the video.
[31:54.680 --> 31:56.100]  I didn't dance very much at the wedding.
[31:56.240 --> 31:58.700]  I'm very specific about what I want to move to,
[31:59.360 --> 32:02.400]  especially in a venue like a wedding where I couldn't get drunk.
[32:03.300 --> 32:04.600]  I'm sorry about that, by the way.
[32:04.660 --> 32:05.960]  No, no, not your fault.
[32:06.620 --> 32:09.840]  Absolutely. But Nina Sky, Move Your Body.
[32:10.040 --> 32:11.920]  Great song. Great song to dance to.
[32:12.300 --> 32:14.160]  For not being drunk. Phenomenal effort.
[32:14.640 --> 32:16.420]  Oh, that's sometimes you just got it.
[32:16.420 --> 32:18.880]  You got to you get out there and you give 110 percent.
[32:19.560 --> 32:22.040]  Yep. And then that like that ends and it starts like
[32:22.040 --> 32:25.900]  I think it started and they were playing like Kiss by Prince.
[32:26.000 --> 32:27.720]  And I went, fucking great song.
[32:27.860 --> 32:28.700]  And it got me out there.
[32:29.000 --> 32:30.300]  And then they played that and I went, awesome.
[32:30.540 --> 32:32.920]  And then they played something else and I went, and that's enough for me.
[32:34.640 --> 32:35.660]  I'm just particular.
[32:37.020 --> 32:40.100]  Well, I'm just I agree you were given at 110 percent for sure.
[32:40.120 --> 32:42.380]  I thought that was I that was fantastic. It was great moves.
[32:42.660 --> 32:43.680]  That's why I wanted to share it.
[32:43.720 --> 32:46.420]  I didn't know that Eric was so talented on the dance floor.
[32:46.780 --> 32:50.140]  Thank you. I've been to many weddings and have danced that way.
[32:50.740 --> 32:52.100]  Many, many, many times.
[32:52.540 --> 32:54.180]  And show. Oh, thank you.
[32:54.660 --> 32:56.120]  Thank you very much. Practiced.
[32:56.280 --> 32:59.060]  Yeah. Yeah. It's you know, you just got you feel the rhythm.
[32:59.460 --> 33:00.400]  Move your body. Great song.
[33:00.600 --> 33:03.800]  It's just sometimes you get out there and it's exactly what you want to hear.
[33:04.300 --> 33:06.640]  You're letting the song do all the work, honestly.
[33:06.820 --> 33:07.780]  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
[33:07.820 --> 33:10.540]  I'm just moving my body like it says, move your body. Yeah.
[33:11.280 --> 33:13.080]  So those are simply instructions.
[33:18.080 --> 33:20.220]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[33:20.800 --> 33:21.960]  We're in the holiday season.
[33:21.960 --> 33:23.360]  It's a stressful time.
[33:23.500 --> 33:26.860]  You got to get gifts for people to be a lot or maybe you don't, you know,
[33:26.860 --> 33:30.180]  like different families and different friend groups have different procedures.
[33:30.180 --> 33:33.520]  But it's still just a time in which I personally feel
[33:33.520 --> 33:37.840]  both incredibly excited as well as very, very stressed.
[33:38.260 --> 33:40.820]  And whether or not your family gives gifts during the holidays,
[33:40.820 --> 33:42.940]  you get to define how you give to yourself.
[33:43.460 --> 33:45.180]  And the holidays are a great time to do that.
[33:45.440 --> 33:48.180]  So whether it's by starting therapy, going easy on yourself
[33:48.180 --> 33:51.560]  during the tough moments or treating yourself to a day of complete rest,
[33:51.960 --> 33:54.240]  remember to give yourself some love this holiday season,
[33:54.600 --> 33:56.460]  which is so important, all seasons.
[33:57.340 --> 34:01.480]  Something that I have struggled with in the past is loving who I am
[34:01.480 --> 34:06.900]  and embracing myself and understanding, not just understanding, but feeling,
[34:07.300 --> 34:11.480]  I guess, is the difficult part that I've had of logically knowing
[34:11.480 --> 34:15.920]  that I deserve to take care of myself and love the person that I am.
[34:16.360 --> 34:21.420]  But to fully embrace that is something that I struggled with for a long time.
[34:21.420 --> 34:23.780]  That therapy really helped me with,
[34:24.980 --> 34:27.720]  which therapy has helped me in so many ways as I talk about every time.
[34:27.900 --> 34:29.300]  I couldn't recommend it enough.
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.680]  I think it's a really important process to go through.
[34:32.820 --> 34:37.820]  And I gained so many positive things that I would have never discovered
[34:37.820 --> 34:40.580]  or learned about myself without going through that process.
[34:41.100 --> 34:44.000]  So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.

[38:15.500 --> 38:19.520]  Hey, can I tell you guys about the thing that happened to me at my honeymoon?
[38:20.220 --> 38:21.280]  Of course. Yeah.
[38:21.360 --> 38:24.160]  Yeah. I wanted to tell last week, but we ran out of time and I'm scared
[38:24.160 --> 38:26.220]  I'll forget how to tell it if I don't tell it soon.
[38:26.820 --> 38:28.800]  OK, because it wasn't that big of a deal.
[38:28.860 --> 38:33.120]  But it's pretty I think for I think I think most people would be embarrassed.
[38:33.220 --> 38:35.740]  Not I, but maybe most people would.
[38:36.320 --> 38:40.000]  So for the honeymoon, Emily and I went to one of the like
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.540]  an all inclusive resort in Cancun, very similar, Eric, to where we went together
[38:44.220 --> 38:47.460]  just on the other side, like in Playa Mujeres.
[38:47.740 --> 38:49.600]  Oh, nice. Just a little further down the road.
[38:50.160 --> 38:53.900]  And first off, I wanted to say, I think I sent you guys pictures,
[38:54.100 --> 38:55.580]  but it was protected by Falcons.
[38:55.700 --> 38:56.820]  There was a Falcon on site.
[38:58.020 --> 38:59.920]  So we we felt extremely safe.
[39:00.020 --> 39:02.720]  Although Emily, Emily made.
[39:03.300 --> 39:07.720]  I swear to God's on day one, Emily saw a lizard and went
[39:08.420 --> 39:11.700]  like one of those big salamander or like one of those big lizards.
[39:11.700 --> 39:15.120]  And she goes, she goes, she's made eye contact with a iguana.
[39:15.240 --> 39:18.200]  Thank you. She saw an iguana and she just made eye contact with it.
[39:18.240 --> 39:19.540]  And she was like, oh, that's so cute.
[39:20.040 --> 39:24.220]  And from that moment on, like iguanas talk, I guess.
[39:24.700 --> 39:28.120]  And they just like everywhere we went, there were five iguanas
[39:28.120 --> 39:30.140]  staring, making eye contact at Emily.
[39:30.340 --> 39:34.140]  Like they were either like enraptured by her or they hated her.
[39:34.240 --> 39:35.220]  I couldn't figure it out.
[39:35.480 --> 39:38.900]  But we couldn't get away from them to the point where I think we sent you guys
[39:38.900 --> 39:42.120]  a videos where one of the video where one of the iguanas like jumped up
[39:42.120 --> 39:43.980]  into her lap to try to get her food.
[39:44.360 --> 39:45.820]  Yeah, like she was fucking terrified.
[39:45.960 --> 39:48.520]  And every time we turned around, there was an iguana within a foot of her.
[39:48.740 --> 39:51.600]  One of them, we were laying down in a bed by the beach, and one of them
[39:51.600 --> 39:54.260]  just hopped up on the bed next to her and just walked right up to her
[39:54.260 --> 39:56.480]  and started eating her sandwich in front of her.
[39:56.660 --> 39:59.060]  Like as if to say, fuck you, what are you going to do about it?
[39:59.080 --> 40:00.800]  And we were just like, yeah, I got the fuck out of there.
[40:00.980 --> 40:02.520]  Like it won the sandwich.
[40:02.600 --> 40:03.400]  It was actually a quesadilla.
[40:03.560 --> 40:05.640]  It ate the whole fucking quesadilla. It was insane.
[40:07.340 --> 40:09.120]  And they're big. They're big.
[40:09.420 --> 40:11.820]  Anyway, we go to this all inclusive.
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.240]  It was like a little different.
[40:14.120 --> 40:16.420]  And by different, it was supposed to be like more romantic.
[40:16.720 --> 40:19.000]  But I think that really just meant it was a little more expensive
[40:19.540 --> 40:21.560]  and had somehow less options.
[40:21.740 --> 40:23.160]  Eric, like there was no fucking...
[40:23.160 --> 40:26.280]  I would say maybe the best thing at the one we went to was the buffet.
[40:26.720 --> 40:28.960]  Oh, yeah. Oh, there's no buffet at this one.
[40:29.640 --> 40:31.420]  Oh, so like why? What?
[40:31.760 --> 40:34.240]  Right. And so you got to like go to dinner and you're like,
[40:34.240 --> 40:36.320]  you have to pick one of the fucking theme restaurant.
[40:36.440 --> 40:37.840]  You're like, I guess we're eating French tonight.
[40:38.160 --> 40:42.640]  But how are you supposed to eat like pizza and stars?
[40:43.060 --> 40:44.040]  Exactly. You can't.
[40:44.100 --> 40:46.200]  There's a pizza restaurant you can go eat pizza at.
[40:46.400 --> 40:47.500]  Did they have stars?
[40:47.800 --> 40:49.740]  No, there was no stars to be found, unfortunately.
[40:50.540 --> 40:53.620]  The candy selection was real dog shit, if I'm being honest with you.
[40:54.020 --> 40:59.400]  But anyway, I wanted to do I wanted to have like the most relaxing vacation ever.
[40:59.440 --> 41:00.860]  We were only there for like four or five days.
[41:01.380 --> 41:04.360]  And we relaxed hard when we went together, Eric.
[41:04.640 --> 41:06.060]  But I wanted to beat that.
[41:06.140 --> 41:07.800]  I wanted to be even more relaxing than that.
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.560]  I wanted to do even less than we did.
[41:09.720 --> 41:11.340]  And so and I think we set out to do that.
[41:11.400 --> 41:13.120]  We would and I felt pretty good about it.
[41:13.140 --> 41:15.200]  We did two days that were just spa days.
[41:15.480 --> 41:20.380]  And so the first spa day we go there and I emailed ahead
[41:20.380 --> 41:23.720]  because all that shit books up and I just said, hey, my my fiance and I are getting married.
[41:23.780 --> 41:24.640]  It's going to be our honeymoon.
[41:25.220 --> 41:27.380]  Can you just pamper us for two days?
[41:28.780 --> 41:31.780]  And I don't know what I don't understand what any of this shit is.
[41:32.020 --> 41:34.060]  So could you just give us like the honeymoon package or whatever?
[41:34.120 --> 41:35.160]  And they're like, we'll take care of you.
[41:35.340 --> 41:39.020]  So I get an email the night before and they just go, just show up at the sauna
[41:39.020 --> 41:41.040]  or at the spa tomorrow in swim trunks.
[41:41.140 --> 41:41.780]  That's all you need.
[41:41.960 --> 41:42.500]  I'm like, OK.
[41:42.980 --> 41:45.360]  So I just showed up in swim trunks and Emily showed up in a bathing suit.
[41:45.460 --> 41:48.080]  And then we did like an hour long hydrotherapy thing
[41:48.080 --> 41:50.840]  where they make you get in hot water and then cold water and then a sauna
[41:50.840 --> 41:53.940]  and then a then a steam room and the whole thing. Right.
[41:54.480 --> 41:57.280]  And when we came out, they go, OK, now you're ready for your next thing.
[41:57.280 --> 42:00.360]  You're going to get a full body like sugar scrub.
[42:00.460 --> 42:01.820]  We're going to scrub your whole body down.
[42:02.160 --> 42:03.400]  And we're like, oh, cool.
[42:03.480 --> 42:04.740]  That sounds fun, I guess.
[42:04.900 --> 42:07.720]  And the lady hands me what.
[42:08.780 --> 42:10.460]  I can only describe as.
[42:11.820 --> 42:12.960]  A Speedo diaper.
[42:14.040 --> 42:18.460]  Like if a Speedo was a diaper, it's the same color as like a hospital gown,
[42:18.960 --> 42:23.340]  you know, OK, and it's like elastic, but it's the size of a Speedo.
[42:24.300 --> 42:27.280]  But it looks like a poofy little diaper.
[42:27.460 --> 42:31.360]  And she goes, she's like talking to Emily and telling Emily where to go.
[42:31.540 --> 42:33.900]  And then she tells me she's like, just put this on and then me to sit here.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.500]  And I go, OK. And I she must have said some other stuff.
[42:36.580 --> 42:37.300]  I didn't hear her.
[42:38.040 --> 42:41.320]  But I'd also been blasted in the head with water jets for like the last hour.
[42:41.420 --> 42:42.560]  So I might not have been able to hear too good.
[42:43.100 --> 42:47.320]  And so she's like, you know, just go back into your fucking locker room
[42:47.320 --> 42:48.780]  and put this on. And I go, OK.
[42:49.300 --> 42:51.880]  And when I went in there initially, because I only bought swim trunks,
[42:51.880 --> 42:53.860]  they were like, just go. Here's your locker number.
[42:54.020 --> 42:55.480]  Just go put your stuff in that locker and lock it.
[42:55.520 --> 42:57.220]  So I go and throw my phone and stuff in there and lock it.
[42:57.480 --> 42:59.820]  And then there's like I didn't think about it, but there was like some
[43:00.520 --> 43:03.540]  there was some rubber shoes and a rope. Right.
[43:03.800 --> 43:06.800]  And so I put I take my clothes off, my swim trunks off,
[43:07.180 --> 43:09.520]  and I put the diaper on.
[43:11.180 --> 43:14.820]  And it looks like if ZZ Top wore a COVID mask.
[43:16.300 --> 43:18.380]  It's like pubic hair everywhere.
[43:18.380 --> 43:23.240]  My balls are so much bigger than this thing can accommodate.
[43:23.940 --> 43:28.280]  And so I got like a ball hanging out the left or a ball hanging out the right.
[43:28.360 --> 43:30.480]  But there's no way to keep both balls contained.
[43:30.800 --> 43:31.900]  You can stack them.
[43:32.540 --> 43:33.660]  No, no, dude, it's not.
[43:33.740 --> 43:35.460]  I'm telling you, it's not. It's it.
[43:35.480 --> 43:36.300]  There's not room.
[43:37.160 --> 43:39.460]  And and it's also poofy in all the directions.
[43:39.460 --> 43:41.020]  And it's almost like a G string.
[43:41.460 --> 43:44.200]  You know that that wooden toy that you can play with,
[43:44.200 --> 43:47.100]  that like the wooden balls and we're like one goes down, one goes up.
[43:47.100 --> 43:49.040]  Like that's just what I'm imagining in my head.
[43:49.240 --> 43:50.560]  I wish those things were called.
[43:51.240 --> 43:55.220]  And so I'm looking in the mirror and I'm just dumped out of this thing.
[43:55.420 --> 44:00.060]  And like you can see like 80% of my dick and my like most of both of my balls,
[44:00.120 --> 44:02.080]  honestly. And there's just like pubic hair everywhere.
[44:02.440 --> 44:05.200]  And I look at my look at myself in the mirror and I'm like,
[44:05.240 --> 44:07.540]  I mean, I read a spa, right?
[44:07.600 --> 44:12.120]  She wouldn't have told me to put it on if she didn't want me to wear it.
[44:13.200 --> 44:15.240]  So if I get when in Rome, right.
[44:15.240 --> 44:17.800]  So I walk outside and outside is into the sauna.
[44:18.360 --> 44:20.320]  And I don't know where to go. Emily's still inside.
[44:20.560 --> 44:22.980]  So I just sit like in a chair with my fucking legs open.
[44:24.080 --> 44:27.580]  Just like, I guess showing the world everything because like, fuck it.
[44:27.900 --> 44:29.300]  That's that's what I'm doing.
[44:29.420 --> 44:30.680]  What she told me to do. Right.
[44:30.780 --> 44:31.940]  I'm trying to fit in there.
[44:32.360 --> 44:35.640]  But then I start to notice like all the married couples and the old ladies
[44:35.640 --> 44:38.080]  and all the people around me are starting to look pretty fucking horrified.
[44:39.580 --> 44:42.780]  And and and like I'm getting a lot of dirty looks.
[44:42.780 --> 44:43.980]  And then I hear, sir.
[44:45.440 --> 44:49.060]  Sir, and I turn over and I see my lady running at me full speed.
[44:49.160 --> 44:53.820]  And she goes, she's going, sir, no, sir, no, no, sir, sir, no.
[44:53.980 --> 44:55.260]  And she gets to me and she's out of breath.
[44:55.340 --> 44:56.480]  But she gets me and I'm like, hey, what's up?
[44:56.700 --> 44:59.540]  And she's like, the robe, put your robe on.
[44:59.700 --> 45:02.820]  And I was like, oh, I guess I missed that part.
[45:03.040 --> 45:04.300]  And so I had to put my robe on.
[45:04.760 --> 45:06.580]  I guess I wasn't supposed to go out there in the diaper.
[45:06.740 --> 45:10.220]  And so I showed like 30 people my dick and my balls.
[45:16.340 --> 45:20.720]  That's. And yeah, that's why I just see a bunch of people in robes.
[45:22.520 --> 45:23.860]  I did. I didn't think about it.
[45:23.920 --> 45:25.160]  There were tons of people in robes.
[45:25.300 --> 45:27.840]  Anyone else? I don't know anyone else that's what happened to.
[45:27.980 --> 45:31.360]  If I was unsure, I would have been peeking around every corner.
[45:31.500 --> 45:33.220]  I'd be just be trying to get a look of anyone.
[45:34.040 --> 45:37.020]  You got to stroll out and spread legs.
[45:37.340 --> 45:38.680]  You got to own it, dude.
[45:38.920 --> 45:41.600]  You got to. And I thought I was a gynecologist.
[45:41.600 --> 45:43.680]  I was following instructions.
[45:43.900 --> 45:46.320]  I didn't realize I missed some of the instructions.
[45:46.500 --> 45:50.300]  And I stopped halfway along, but I was just following instructions anyway.
[45:50.820 --> 45:52.280]  So that was real awkward.
[45:52.840 --> 45:54.520]  And Emily started laughing.
[45:55.020 --> 45:58.660]  And I shit you not, she didn't stop laughing for 24 hours.
[45:58.940 --> 46:03.220]  Like she laughed for the for 24 straight hours.
[46:03.780 --> 46:06.280]  Just any time it popped up, she just would lose it.
[46:06.360 --> 46:08.620]  And so I've never heard her laugh so much or so hard.
[46:09.320 --> 46:11.780]  Uh, it must have been hideous.
[46:11.860 --> 46:13.800]  I actually wanted to take a picture of the diaper.
[46:14.360 --> 46:19.100]  I was going to take a picture of the next day because we went back for another day of another session.
[46:19.760 --> 46:21.400]  And they didn't give me the diaper this time.
[46:21.420 --> 46:23.560]  And I was actually bummed because we did the same hydrotherapy thing.
[46:23.620 --> 46:24.780]  I didn't mean to double book it, but I did.
[46:24.860 --> 46:26.320]  But this time they were going to give us massages.
[46:28.100 --> 46:31.560]  And so after I took my swim trunks off, they took us to the massage room.
[46:31.560 --> 46:33.260]  And they were like, all right, get under the covers.
[46:33.300 --> 46:36.920]  We'll leave. And I usually have like underwear on when I.
[46:37.580 --> 46:40.200]  Oh, yeah, Gracie's like, I wouldn't be able to show my face the second day.
[46:40.280 --> 46:41.580]  Yeah, no, I walked in proudly.
[46:43.620 --> 46:46.160]  But so the next day I went and I learned something about myself.
[46:46.200 --> 46:53.200]  I've never had a completely naked massage before and I don't like them at all.
[46:53.700 --> 47:01.520]  Every time the lady would massage my thigh, my asshole winked and it was freaking me out.
[47:01.560 --> 47:04.520]  And I kept thinking, can this lady see that my butthole is winking at her?
[47:04.540 --> 47:06.060]  And why is it doing this?
[47:06.060 --> 47:08.860]  Why would it do this just because I'm not wearing underwear?
[47:09.120 --> 47:12.020]  Is she like touching something to my thigh that's making my butt wink?
[47:12.160 --> 47:13.380]  And it creeped me out.
[47:13.460 --> 47:18.740]  And so for like 30 minutes of an hour, a 90 minute massage, all I could think about is like, please stop winking my butthole, lady.
[47:19.020 --> 47:20.060]  Please. It wasn't relaxing.
[47:20.560 --> 47:21.360]  I was just terrified.
[47:21.980 --> 47:26.960]  Was it just the tug was like pulling your butt cheek and just opening it was just like just like rubbing my thigh.
[47:27.060 --> 47:32.500]  And then my butthole would just go like bloop and just open up and close and open up and close like it was yawning or winking.
[47:32.580 --> 47:35.460]  And I don't know why I thought like, is it because I'm not wearing underwear?
[47:35.460 --> 47:37.540]  Because I'm uncomfortable that I'm just hyper aware.
[47:37.620 --> 47:39.200]  Do I always do this, but I'm not wearing underwear.
[47:39.480 --> 47:40.780]  So it's hidden. So I don't think about it.
[47:40.960 --> 47:43.000]  Is does the lady know I'm winking at her?
[47:43.160 --> 47:44.640]  Does this happen to her all the time?
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.600]  Fucking took me out of the massage.
[47:46.760 --> 47:47.760]  I got to be honest with you.
[47:48.300 --> 47:49.620]  So you had a relaxing time.
[47:50.980 --> 47:51.540]  Sort of.
[47:51.600 --> 47:53.140]  There was one other thing I realized.
[47:54.960 --> 47:56.380]  So before the wedding.
[47:57.420 --> 48:04.960]  I got a pedicure with some friends of mine that aren't you guys, and we went and well, I'm just saying like it just did.
[48:04.960 --> 48:09.360]  I don't think, you know, Eric, a different Eric or Jeremy.
[48:09.640 --> 48:10.600]  Do you know Eric and Jeremy?
[48:10.820 --> 48:12.520]  They're like, no, but they're Emily's friends.
[48:12.980 --> 48:18.120]  But but if you said I got a pedicure with some friends, we know that we didn't get that pedicure.
[48:18.200 --> 48:21.280]  You didn't need to clarify to us that we weren't there.
[48:21.920 --> 48:23.320]  Yeah, well, you guys weren't there.
[48:23.560 --> 48:25.600]  Yeah, we had all the information and then you just rubbed it.
[48:25.680 --> 48:26.360]  We're aware of that.
[48:26.460 --> 48:27.440]  Well, I was trying to rub it in.
[48:27.480 --> 48:28.620]  I guess I was trying to make it clear to the audience.
[48:28.960 --> 48:31.740]  Anyway, I just got a pedicure with some friends that aren't you guys.
[48:33.040 --> 48:36.080]  And it definitely wasn't you guys.
[48:37.700 --> 48:38.880]  And and it was nice.
[48:39.020 --> 48:41.540]  And I hadn't had a pedicure and I think I've had one in my life.
[48:41.600 --> 48:42.840]  So it was like kind of fun and relaxing.
[48:42.940 --> 48:43.740]  It was right before the wedding.
[48:44.000 --> 48:45.000]  I mean, neither of we.
[48:45.280 --> 48:49.520]  So and well, Eric, you were invited to the monthly pedicure party.
[48:49.600 --> 48:51.260]  We're going to start having and you accepted.
[48:51.700 --> 48:52.800]  OK, I accepted.
[48:52.980 --> 48:55.300]  But you're talking about one I didn't get to go to.
[48:55.580 --> 48:57.040]  But it's with these guys.
[48:57.040 --> 48:58.600]  This is going to be the same pedicure party.
[48:58.680 --> 49:01.320]  We're going to go to you. We're all going to be your parties work.
[49:01.320 --> 49:02.300]  I have I've been invited.
[49:02.420 --> 49:05.080]  I haven't been issued like, oh, here's when will you invite it?
[49:07.400 --> 49:08.120]  Uh, yesterday.
[49:08.440 --> 49:09.980]  Talk to me. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:09.980 --> 49:10.940]  Yeah. Just we're hanging out.
[49:11.200 --> 49:12.840]  Yeah. Yeah. We're hanging out.
[49:12.860 --> 49:14.080]  And it's, you know, not a big deal.
[49:14.480 --> 49:15.280]  Huh? That's not a big deal.
[49:15.940 --> 49:17.960]  I was hanging out yesterday with a friend that is Eric.
[49:18.860 --> 49:22.040]  And so anyway, so then I go.
[49:22.080 --> 49:25.880]  And one of the parts of the first spa day is another pedicure,
[49:25.940 --> 49:28.940]  which, by the way, you need a pedicure once every.
[49:29.500 --> 49:31.300]  I mean, if you get a pedicure once every ten years,
[49:31.300 --> 49:32.260]  I guess is where I'm at.
[49:33.080 --> 49:34.480]  Two and four days is a lot.
[49:34.800 --> 49:38.020]  And so I thought, like, this seems fucking excessive, but I paid for it.
[49:38.020 --> 49:39.640]  So whatever. And so I get that pedicure.
[49:39.960 --> 49:42.960]  And then the next fucking day, when we go back to the spa,
[49:43.520 --> 49:45.940]  they give me a foot massage, which is cool.
[49:46.580 --> 49:49.960]  But then I got to thinking three complete strangers
[49:49.960 --> 49:52.880]  have been all over my feet in the last week.
[49:53.360 --> 49:56.460]  That's more people than have seen my feet in the last 10 years.
[49:56.460 --> 49:57.480]  That's just weird.
[49:57.940 --> 49:59.120]  Yeah. Gavin would have been in heaven.
[49:59.120 --> 50:01.840]  He would have been just like fucking you've just been cum spots everywhere.
[50:02.180 --> 50:05.480]  But it was like I just I got to kind of grossed out about it
[50:05.480 --> 50:06.220]  when I thought about it.
[50:06.320 --> 50:10.160]  Like, uh, I don't like it kind of creeped me out
[50:10.160 --> 50:12.660]  that all these people had touched my feet and my feet felt dirty
[50:12.660 --> 50:13.660]  and I felt like I had to wash them.
[50:14.140 --> 50:17.180]  And then I was like kind of happy to be leaving the honeymoon
[50:17.180 --> 50:19.500]  and to go home because I was like, I'm done with the foot stuff.
[50:19.520 --> 50:21.120]  At least like that was a bit much.
[50:21.400 --> 50:22.580]  Go through fucking security.
[50:22.820 --> 50:24.520]  And Emily checked the bag.
[50:25.260 --> 50:28.360]  She's gotten really into checking bags lately, which I'm not on board with.
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.180]  But so what are you going to do?
[50:30.260 --> 50:32.060]  We're married now, you know, there's nothing I can do about it.
[50:33.040 --> 50:34.620]  And so she checked a bag.
[50:34.740 --> 50:36.880]  And so I had no bags in the airport, which
[50:38.340 --> 50:40.800]  in Emily and Vanessa and Bernie, every time they see me in the airport
[50:40.800 --> 50:43.440]  with no bags, the second time I've done that, they say they tell me
[50:43.440 --> 50:45.760]  I look like a terrorist and they don't want to stand next to me.
[50:46.880 --> 50:49.740]  But if you they're right, if you look around, everybody's got a bag,
[50:49.800 --> 50:52.020]  but me and I definitely stand out anyway.
[50:52.120 --> 50:54.860]  So she's brushing shit in the checked bag.
[50:54.900 --> 50:56.200]  Just throw it all in Emily's bag.
[50:57.140 --> 50:59.860]  She's already checking a bag and it's big, so just fuck it.
[51:00.160 --> 51:01.440]  Have you never done that before?
[51:02.400 --> 51:05.240]  Like checked everything and just walked on with like nothing.
[51:05.560 --> 51:07.520]  I've walked on a plane with nothing.
[51:07.680 --> 51:09.520]  I don't like to nothing, just not brought anything.
[51:09.780 --> 51:13.900]  I did it one time and I was told that it is it's psycho behavior.
[51:14.180 --> 51:17.380]  Yeah. And that I looked like a serial killer walking on with nothing.
[51:17.720 --> 51:22.060]  And I feel like every time I travel, I bring like nine lithium batteries with me.
[51:22.100 --> 51:23.000]  So that's all going to come.
[51:23.880 --> 51:24.720]  They can't be checked, right?
[51:24.720 --> 51:28.120]  Like my laptop, my switch, my steam deck, all my goodies.
[51:28.260 --> 51:29.320]  You got to bring your goodies.
[51:31.600 --> 51:37.040]  So we go through security and they like, you know how they check your passport
[51:37.040 --> 51:39.680]  when you're getting on a plane in a foreign country before you had to go to that?
[51:39.740 --> 51:40.940]  Yes. Like a little area.
[51:41.240 --> 51:43.900]  And so they check my passport and it dings up and they go, sir,
[51:43.900 --> 51:45.860]  you've been selected for secondary screening.
[51:45.940 --> 51:48.880]  And I go, awesome, awesome.
[51:49.080 --> 51:50.260]  I'm all about it.
[51:50.320 --> 51:51.860]  She's like, grab your bags and come over here.
[51:51.860 --> 51:52.860]  And I'm like, got them.
[51:53.260 --> 51:54.040]  And I walk over.
[51:54.140 --> 51:55.100]  She's like, where's your bags?
[51:55.140 --> 51:56.180]  And I go, I don't have any bags.
[51:56.480 --> 51:57.860]  This is going to be a real easy search for you.
[51:57.920 --> 52:00.980]  And she looks at me and she just gives this like really annoyed face.
[52:00.980 --> 52:01.980]  And she's like, empty your pockets.
[52:02.040 --> 52:02.740]  And I'm like, they're empty.
[52:02.860 --> 52:03.900]  But here's like, here's my wallet.
[52:03.960 --> 52:04.620]  Here's my phone. That's it.
[52:04.640 --> 52:05.360]  That's all I got, you know?
[52:05.580 --> 52:06.960]  And she pats me down.
[52:07.080 --> 52:08.540]  And then she just and I'm like, OK.
[52:08.820 --> 52:10.740]  And she goes, sir, take your shoes off.
[52:11.040 --> 52:14.080]  And I go, OK, I guess.
[52:14.540 --> 52:17.680]  And so she makes me sit down and she watches me take my shoes off.
[52:17.720 --> 52:18.960]  And then she's like, give me your feet.
[52:18.960 --> 52:24.100]  And then she fucking touched my socked feet to make sure I didn't have,
[52:24.200 --> 52:26.520]  I don't know, knives or guns in my fucking feet.
[52:26.740 --> 52:30.640]  And and I realized those motherfuckers got me one last time.
[52:30.820 --> 52:33.620]  My feet got molested one last time.
[52:34.820 --> 52:36.100]  Can I pass over the title then?
[52:37.020 --> 52:38.260]  Yeah. You're the foot guy.
[52:38.940 --> 52:41.900]  Oh, wow. I hadn't even considered that.
[52:42.720 --> 52:44.440]  Geoff, you might be the foot guy.
[52:44.600 --> 52:45.940]  I'm a reluctant foot guy.
[52:45.940 --> 52:47.640]  It's like how Gavin says,
[52:48.220 --> 52:50.300]  I don't want girls to put their finger on my butt.
[52:50.400 --> 52:51.540]  They just do it all the time.
[52:51.620 --> 52:54.220]  I don't want anybody to touch my fucking feet.
[52:54.300 --> 52:55.700]  They just keep doing it.
[52:56.580 --> 52:57.500]  Sorry, Gracie.
[52:59.160 --> 53:00.460]  That's 10 years old.
[53:00.520 --> 53:01.400]  Everybody knows that.
[53:01.740 --> 53:03.160]  That's old Achievement Hunter shit.
[53:03.320 --> 53:04.900]  Everybody knows that.
[53:06.420 --> 53:07.800]  I just had a bit of a run.
[53:10.980 --> 53:12.980]  A run is one way to describe it.
[53:13.380 --> 53:14.300]  Oh, my God.
[53:14.880 --> 53:16.920]  I had nothing to do with it, really.
[53:18.080 --> 53:20.240]  It sounds like you were a main player in it.
[53:22.160 --> 53:25.980]  Have you guys seen that TikTok going around about supposedly
[53:25.980 --> 53:30.080]  Michael Jackson has a different voice in private or had a different voice in private?
[53:30.500 --> 53:32.600]  Yeah. Is it real?
[53:33.600 --> 53:34.340]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[53:35.060 --> 53:36.100]  That's crazy. There's no way.
[53:36.140 --> 53:37.660]  Yeah. He didn't sound like that.
[53:38.060 --> 53:42.660]  Oh, you see the like he apparently in Ready to Rumble 2, he was a character in it.
[53:42.920 --> 53:45.180]  He did. And it's his it's his real voice.
[53:45.180 --> 53:48.320]  Yeah. Like, yeah, I think he could do a real deep bassy voice.
[53:48.800 --> 53:51.380]  Apparently, like I was I watched a bunch of videos about it.
[53:51.440 --> 53:54.360]  And apparently, like any time he was out with like other like
[53:55.120 --> 53:58.020]  musicians or movie stars or rappers or whoever, they'd tell me stories.
[53:58.240 --> 54:00.580]  They'd be like, as soon as everybody would like leave the green room,
[54:00.620 --> 54:02.580]  it was just like me and Michael Jordan or Michael Jackson.
[54:02.700 --> 54:05.240]  He'd be like, I thought those motherfuckers would never leave anyway.
[54:05.480 --> 54:09.460]  Be like a totally like you drop it and just go into a totally like macho dude.
[54:10.600 --> 54:12.660]  I I have this with Timothy Olyphant.
[54:13.100 --> 54:13.740]  It's oh, really?
[54:13.740 --> 54:16.420]  Yeah, I I'm that is my conspiracy.
[54:16.660 --> 54:18.980]  I think he is like Mr. Fake Voice.
[54:19.420 --> 54:24.820]  If you watch him and like scream, watch him acting and he has the most high pitch
[54:24.820 --> 54:26.180]  nasally voice.
[54:26.460 --> 54:30.100]  And then I watched an interview at around that time and he has the same voice.
[54:30.240 --> 54:34.480]  And now he always sounds like a really gruff kind of rustic cowboy.
[54:34.740 --> 54:36.300]  Interesting. Voices can age.
[54:37.500 --> 54:41.300]  It's a complete shift in both tone and style of speaking.
[54:41.300 --> 54:45.480]  I think he put a real effort in because he had a shit voice when he made scream.
[54:47.640 --> 54:50.040]  He went all like Elizabeth Holmes with it.
[54:51.620 --> 54:53.500]  I posted a I posted a tick tock.
[54:53.580 --> 54:59.100]  If you want to hear Michael Jackson's supposedly real voice from Ready to Rumble, too.
[54:59.320 --> 55:01.400]  Yeah, apparently that's what he actually sounds like.
[55:01.480 --> 55:05.080]  And the high pitch voice was something he put on for the for the audience.
[55:05.320 --> 55:07.120]  With this group, I can't lose.
[55:08.820 --> 55:09.560]  Weird, right?
[55:09.560 --> 55:13.780]  I'm sure you can probably play that in this like in the file, too.
[55:13.820 --> 55:15.160]  Yeah, we can talk over.
[55:15.200 --> 55:16.520]  It's ready to rumble, too. You're fine.
[55:16.640 --> 55:17.680]  We would do a video game in it.
[55:17.740 --> 55:19.660]  So why wouldn't we or do a let's play it? Why wouldn't we?
[55:20.200 --> 55:21.000]  Yeah, there you go.
[55:21.280 --> 55:22.620]  Andrew, why don't you do your real voice?
[55:23.520 --> 55:25.420]  This is my real voice.
[55:26.480 --> 55:27.420]  Who's high pitch?
[55:28.980 --> 55:30.160]  I'm a real boy.
[55:33.100 --> 55:35.540]  No, yeah, what would be I think would be low, right?
[55:35.560 --> 55:36.140]  My real voice.
[55:36.820 --> 55:37.720]  It would be funnier.
[55:37.800 --> 55:39.200]  I think it's funnier low than high.
[55:40.740 --> 55:42.460]  Oh, my ankle.
[55:42.760 --> 55:43.480]  No, it's not.
[55:43.720 --> 55:44.840]  I got to work on that.
[55:45.260 --> 55:47.600]  Because every impression is this.
[55:48.540 --> 55:50.020]  He's telling Andrew the giant.
[55:53.480 --> 55:54.380]  Hey, Gavin.
[55:54.820 --> 55:55.080]  Yeah.
[55:56.040 --> 55:58.540]  You and I have something we got to do together.
[55:59.000 --> 56:00.260]  We've got to write our smut.
[56:01.020 --> 56:01.800]  Oh, yeah.
[56:01.980 --> 56:03.120]  Speaking of anal runs.
[56:03.260 --> 56:05.180]  I was going to propose something to you.
[56:05.480 --> 56:06.380]  Let's go see how you feel about this.
[56:06.720 --> 56:08.340]  You and I are going together.
[56:08.340 --> 56:13.160]  I don't know if anybody else knows about this, but you and I are going to New York City together to spend the weekend together.
[56:14.140 --> 56:14.840]  Me, me and you.
[56:15.240 --> 56:16.520]  We're going to go Friday to Sunday.
[56:17.060 --> 56:18.480]  The girls are going to be doing something.
[56:18.620 --> 56:23.620]  And so we're going to have most of the time just to ourselves, I think, except for like dinner and shows and stuff.
[56:24.180 --> 56:24.320]  Yeah.
[56:24.480 --> 56:31.980]  What if we found the location in New York City that's like the best like poet,
[56:33.480 --> 56:37.980]  like grizzled New York journalist writer bar, where like all the most famous,
[56:37.980 --> 56:40.920]  like all the beat poets, all the most famous literary figures went.
[56:41.160 --> 56:44.680]  And we go there and that's where we sit down and write our smut.
[56:44.780 --> 56:45.900]  That's where we put pen to paper.
[56:46.080 --> 56:47.160]  It'd be like the time where we were in.
[56:47.400 --> 56:51.080]  What country were we in when we came up with episode 100 of Minecraft?
[56:51.400 --> 56:53.160]  We were in Hungary, I believe.
[56:53.540 --> 56:54.480]  Yeah, used to be like that.
[56:54.840 --> 56:55.460]  Yeah, exactly.
[56:55.580 --> 56:56.840]  I'm trying to recreate that moment.
[56:56.920 --> 57:02.200]  But I thought like we might be inspired if we're at like some dive where like Allen Ginsberg wrote his best stuff.
[57:05.680 --> 57:07.220]  Yeah, we should absolutely do that.
[57:07.220 --> 57:10.480]  OK, yeah, Saturday morning, because I was thinking about today.
[57:10.540 --> 57:12.140]  I was like, what the fuck are we going to do all day?
[57:12.260 --> 57:12.660]  I don't know.
[57:12.840 --> 57:13.660]  I don't know.
[57:13.660 --> 57:15.800]  I was like, when was the last time Gavin and I were in New York City together?
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.220]  What have we ever done together in New York City?
[57:18.360 --> 57:20.360]  Like, are we just going to fucking...
[57:20.360 --> 57:22.840]  I think the last time we were both there, we went to Rockstar.
[57:23.800 --> 57:24.080]  Oh.
[57:24.460 --> 57:25.600]  Or we did like a live show or something.
[57:26.020 --> 57:26.300]  Yeah.
[57:27.000 --> 57:28.580]  You guys should go back to Rockstar.
[57:28.960 --> 57:29.660]  Maybe let's play.
[57:29.720 --> 57:31.160]  Maybe it's a let's play live or something.
[57:32.780 --> 57:38.380]  I can't believe that that that GTA 6 trailer came out and then it said 2025 at the end.
[57:39.280 --> 57:42.900]  And then I just thought about how many GTAs I have left in my life.
[57:43.100 --> 57:44.320]  And I think it's three.
[57:44.820 --> 57:46.220]  Maybe, maybe three.
[57:47.420 --> 57:53.060]  I actually wrote that as a comment on the trailer and it got like 300,000 likes.
[57:53.260 --> 57:54.940]  Oh my god!
[57:55.600 --> 57:56.040]  Hahaha!
[57:58.760 --> 58:02.060]  That being said, how fucking cool is that trailer?
[58:02.600 --> 58:03.900]  Oh, I can't wait.
[58:03.940 --> 58:04.380]  It's very cool.
[58:04.560 --> 58:05.820]  I can't wait for us to play it.
[58:06.080 --> 58:11.600]  I know it's going to be 50% of what we see there when you actually get into multiplayer
[58:11.600 --> 58:12.700]  and sit down to play it.
[58:12.920 --> 58:16.240]  But 50% of what I saw in that trailer is fucking awesome.
[58:16.720 --> 58:17.260]  You know what I mean?
[58:17.740 --> 58:21.380]  Yeah, but I just have a hard time getting excited for something that's going to come
[58:21.380 --> 58:22.860]  out long after I'm dead.
[58:23.660 --> 58:24.100]  Hahaha!
[58:25.120 --> 58:27.140]  Yeah, look at the top comment on that.
[58:29.500 --> 58:30.800]  Long after I'm dead.
[58:31.620 --> 58:32.920]  Do you think you won't make it, Eric?
[58:33.240 --> 58:34.320]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[58:35.340 --> 58:40.060]  At this point, at the time of recording, the video has been up for 22 hours and it has
[58:40.060 --> 58:41.520]  88 million views.
[58:42.000 --> 58:45.420]  Wait, you made your comment from the Slow Mo Guys account?
[58:46.000 --> 58:46.440]  Hahaha!
[58:46.440 --> 58:47.780]  What other account am I going to make it from?
[58:48.220 --> 58:48.660]  Hahaha!
[58:49.740 --> 58:50.460]  It's my account!
[58:50.460 --> 58:50.620]  Hahaha!
[58:51.660 --> 58:53.800]  I don't know why that's so funny!
[58:53.980 --> 58:55.140]  Slow Mo Guys!
[58:55.460 --> 58:57.700]  I've got three GTAs on that!
[58:58.340 --> 59:00.160]  I'll be a comment leaver for GTA.
[59:00.720 --> 59:04.700]  I've been logged into YouTube as Achievement Hunter for maybe 12 years.
[59:05.060 --> 59:09.160]  And so anytime I do any commenting on YouTube, it's as Achievement Hunter.
[59:09.840 --> 59:11.580]  425,000 likes, Gavin.
[59:11.660 --> 59:12.420]  Jesus Christ.
[59:12.760 --> 59:12.900]  Wow.
[59:13.160 --> 59:16.280]  That's like a statement to the view count on that video.
[59:16.940 --> 59:19.560]  You should amend it to say, also listen to F*** Face.
[59:19.560 --> 59:20.260]  Hahaha!
[59:22.880 --> 59:25.560]  That's a lot of F*** Face related replies to my comment.
[59:25.940 --> 59:28.300]  There's some really, there's some funny ones like Eat The Pencil.
[59:28.740 --> 59:30.020]  And there's some really sad ones.
[59:30.320 --> 59:35.480]  Like a guy saying, he was like, I'm 68 so this is probably my last one.
[59:35.700 --> 59:36.500]  Oh no!
[59:38.120 --> 59:39.320]  Oh my God.
[59:39.320 --> 59:41.480]  I mean, he's assuming he makes it to 2025.
[59:42.340 --> 59:44.260]  Yeah, you know it's going to get pushed.
[59:44.780 --> 59:45.700]  Oh yeah.
[59:45.700 --> 59:48.080]  I didn't even think about that.
[59:48.880 --> 59:50.480]  I feel like they've already built in the delay.
[59:50.820 --> 59:51.360]  With 2025?
[59:52.540 --> 59:54.160]  There's no way. It's 2026.
[59:54.460 --> 59:56.220]  It depends on where in 2025.
[59:56.420 --> 59:58.060]  I bet you $100, Gavin.
[59:59.020 --> 01:00:02.040]  I bet you a thousand cents.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.300]  Hey, you know what, Gavin?
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:05.420]  You're on.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.840]  I think it's got to be at least 2026.
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.600]  I just don't think there's any way it comes out 2025.
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.620]  Okay, I bet you $100 is 2025.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:12.900]  Okay, okay.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:16.820]  You should have kept it at a hundred cents or a thousand cents,
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:19.900]  and that way you'd have to give him pennies though.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.460]  Yeah, but that's going to be a lot of work for him to go get a bunch of pennies.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.200]  I bet you $100 in shark cards that it releases in 2027.
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.740]  I think someone calculated that
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:41.960]  all the times that I got mugged added together came out to be something like $18 worth of real money.
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:47.900]  It was honestly like millions of dollars that I got mugged for.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.380]  Well worth it.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:50.700]  Or maybe like hundreds of thousands.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:58.020]  I don't want to undercut this, but I wanted to get to a note that we had that just said
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.180]  wheel of years.
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:02.380]  And we said we were going to talk about whatever that is.
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:03.160]  What is that?
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:04.340]  I have it in my notes.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:08.980]  I wrote down wheel of years idea, and then I amended it to say, what was that about?
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.420]  I can't remember the idea.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.060]  Come on.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.600]  Are we deciding on the next season?
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.800]  No, I have since remembered it.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.260]  I just thought that was funny.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.800]  I just went, you just sent me, you pretzeled me.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.220]  My brain, I don't know how to process.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.200]  We were lost, then we were found.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.100]  Wheel of years idea.
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.220]  What was that about?
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:28.360]  Can't remember idea.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:32.520]  Did you make an addition to that that was actually, I do remember?
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.740]  No, I just have since remembered.
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:38.540]  That was the majority of all the Minecraft ideas, except
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.180]  Geoff had a lot of them written.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.260]  So it was like that kind of thing written, but in his handwriting.
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:45.880]  Yeah, that made it harder.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:51.040]  And Geoff's handwriting looks like, it looks like Ryan Dunn's tattoos.
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.900]  It looks about as good as my photos.
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:02.600]  I think the genesis of the idea was that we make a big wheel, kind of like the wheel of punishment
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.940]  we have at Extra Life, like the Jack wheel, you know?
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:13.000]  But it's like different years out of order from like, let's say 1965 to now.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:20.160]  And you like one of us takes a turn and they spin it and then whatever year they land on,
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:26.980]  they have to then go research and find a movie to then present to us that we watch together.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:28.560]  Okay.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:33.700]  Like a weird movie that, you know, like, like something that would be watch along worthy.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.280]  I like it.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.920]  It was, I think it was like somewhere in there and I never felt fully flushed the idea out,
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.920]  but that's where I was. I was headed somewhere like that with this.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.960]  And so it's not a fully, it's not a fully baked idea necessarily.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.580]  I remember that I thought about a second wheel, maybe that it was like movies,
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:56.620]  TVs or music, or maybe a second wheel that it was like genre, like comedy, horror,
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.200]  adventure. And then you spin, but I don't know. But I just thought it would be fun to like,
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.640]  figure out a way to randomize our searches for old, weird stuff.
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:10.740]  Now, do we need, do you need it to be a physical wheel or could we do like a digital wheel?
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.760]  I would like it to be a physical wheel. I think they're more,
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.480]  they're more fun. And they, have you did the clicking? Oh my God.
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.860]  You can get, there's, there's virtual clicking noises.
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:23.780]  That's true. But we have the wheel.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:25.760]  That's true.
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:28.940]  Yeah, but we can have Gavin click the whole time when he sees the little ticker go.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.220]  I don't know. It's hard to think about.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:35.720]  Yeah, we can do it virtually. I don't give a shit. It's just, it's just like some, some love.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.560]  I think I probably had it more worked out when I was going to present it to you guys two weeks
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.760]  ago or whenever. And then it just like, it's just shit out of my brain.
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.240]  Do you want to do a wheel spin right now?
[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:48.460]  I don't know.
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:49.060]  On this thing?
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.500]  Yeah, on this. Do you want to do a wheel spin right? Well, I don't know. We could use...
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.320]  Okay. Well, yeah, but we'll have to do, to do it properly. Can we do a
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:00.420]  wheel spin to randomize who it is? Like, can we do a us wheel spin? And then...
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.400]  Oh, I like that. Yeah.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:02.260]  Yeah.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:04.760]  Spin to see who will then have to spin the wheel.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.220]  Yeah. Spin to see who spins.
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.240]  So how do we pre-spin?
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:12.180]  Hang on. Just put everyone's names in it and then share the screen.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:13.400]  Everybody.
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:21.260]  Also, while Eric's doing that, we were talking yesterday and we think we've decided that we'd
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:25.000]  both look pretty good with extensions. And then we were thinking about who would look the best
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.260]  with extensions. And we decided we want to do a supplemental video where we all have to,
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.760]  where Emily puts extensions in all of us. And then we have like a little beauty contest to see.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:35.940]  I think it would be fun just to have this length hair, but to get extensions,
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:36.960]  I think it would look cool.
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.580]  Nick, you're my, you're my dark horse to win it.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.640]  Wow. All right. I even put Gracie in. So that's fun.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.900]  I think Nick's got the best head for a mullet.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.180]  Oh no.
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:49.920]  Yeah, I could see that. Yeah, actually, I agree with that.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:50.860]  I think it's probably...
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:51.860]  I think it would look good on Nick.
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.320]  I heard what you said, Eric.
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:02.460]  Um, okay. For some reason we're spinning this wheel. Um, what happens when somebody wins?
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.400]  They then have to spin the wheel of numbers, I believe.
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:10.540]  I like that as soon as, as soon as we added a name to, um, an egg or eggnog,
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:12.600]  or whatever we change it to, we added another G name.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:13.900]  Yes. Yeah.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:20.500]  So it's just an egg, longer Gs. It's just more Gs, right?
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.140]  We could be gang egg.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.160]  We can be gang egg.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.460]  We can be all sorts of things.
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.660]  Yeah. Thank you, Andrew.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.640]  Yeah, you're welcome.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:32.680]  I'm just saying, you can just throw out ideas all day.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.440]  Or a second idea.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:35.340]  Yep.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:39.800]  Who...
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.460]  All right, Eric, you gonna spin the wheel?
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:43.340]  Let's do it. Uh, all right.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:44.780]  Can you share your screen? Okay, cool.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.260]  Here's the wheel to spin. Whoever this lands on gets to spin the wheel of years.
[01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:57.090]  It's spinning. And the winner is... no way.
[01:05:59.310 --> 01:05:59.790]  Yeah.
[01:06:00.110 --> 01:06:01.090]  And the winner is Gracie.
[01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:02.470]  The winner is Gracie.
[01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:07.470]  Congratulations, Gracie. You get to spin the wheel of years.
[01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:09.270]  Thank God.
[01:06:10.330 --> 01:06:13.190]  All right, Gracie. So, could you share your screen?
[01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:14.330]  What?
[01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:15.070]  What?
[01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:16.550]  Well, so we can see her spin the wheel.
[01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:17.350]  Well, no, I don't...
[01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:18.390]  You're doing this right now?
[01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:20.570]  Oh, okay. Well, we don't have to.
[01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:24.190]  Well, I just assumed Eric would put numbers in, and then it would be the same thing.
[01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:25.310]  And it was just...
[01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:27.910]  Oh, we can do that, too. Eric, put... yeah, let's do it that way.
[01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:29.750]  Put, like, put numbers in?
[01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:31.030]  1915, 19...
[01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:33.590]  No, yeah, 1962. I'll give you the numbers.
[01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:35.210]  I've lost track of what's going on.
[01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:37.010]  So we're...
[01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:38.310]  You've lost track of what's going on?
[01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:41.110]  So we just spun a wheel of names. So now it's Gracie.
[01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:43.810]  And now we're gonna spin the wheel of years.
[01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:48.050]  And once a year is determined, Gracie then needs to pick a film from that year
[01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:48.890]  that we will watch.
[01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:50.190]  To present to us that we'll watch together.
[01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:51.670]  Okay.
[01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:53.310]  Yeah, what don't you get?
[01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:55.750]  Well, I just didn't know we were doing this now in this episode.
[01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:58.790]  You're the one that was supportive of it and said you liked the idea.
[01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:01.110]  I was one that was like, I don't know if this is any good.
[01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:01.970]  I don't know if it's fully baked yet.
[01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:03.930]  I also liked drafts when he described it.
[01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:06.530]  That didn't mean we just stopped making the episode and did drafts.
[01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:09.870]  Can I ask at what point when I said, Gavin,
[01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:11.430]  why don't we do this now?
[01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:12.430]  And you went, yeah.
[01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:13.530]  Where was the...
[01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:15.450]  I mean, it's a great question.
[01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:16.710]  Oh, it is a good question.
[01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:19.750]  Okay, so what I've done is that I have put all the numbers
[01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:22.610]  from 1960 to 2023 in random.
[01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:23.710]  Okay, great.
[01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:25.970]  So that way they randomize here.
[01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:27.170]  That's excellent.
[01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:28.850]  Now, why would it do that?
[01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:33.750]  Why would it put a number in front of all of them?
[01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:34.910]  So I can't, you know what?
[01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:36.030]  Oh, cool.
[01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:39.670]  All right, we're doing it.
[01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:40.410]  All right, copy.
[01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:40.990]  Got it.
[01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:43.310]  We'll minimize the numbers.
[01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:45.350]  And now he's going to insert the random.
[01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:46.230]  Yes!
[01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:49.690]  That's exactly what I thought it would look like.
[01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:51.290]  All right, Gracie.
[01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:54.170]  Gracie, this is the wheel of numbers.
[01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:56.730]  And what's going to happen is we're going to spin it.
[01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:59.890]  And then we're, whatever year it lands on,
[01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:02.310]  you are tasked with picking a movie that we watch.
[01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:03.790]  How about to make it more personalized?
[01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:05.470]  Gracie, how many spins would you like?
[01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:08.870]  Oh, let's do four.
[01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:13.130]  You should also say click when Eric should click.
[01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:14.410]  No, that's your job, Gavin.
[01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:17.570]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:18.490]  Yeah.
[01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:20.270]  Now, do we want it?
[01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:21.230]  Does it have to be movie?
[01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.050]  Are we okay with it being a TV show?
[01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:24.410]  TV show as well.
[01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:26.790]  I think it should be open to media.
[01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:28.310]  I think it's a piece of viewable media.
[01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:29.690]  A piece of viewable media.
[01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:30.590]  That's a great way to put it.
[01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:31.990]  Because it's not music.
[01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:34.350]  It's got to be like a movie show, something like that.
[01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:38.030]  Oh, also there was a shuffle here that I didn't, I wasn't aware of.
[01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:41.490]  I like the way you did it.
[01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:42.990]  Oh, fuck.
[01:08:43.230 --> 01:08:43.410]  Okay.
[01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:45.490]  All right, Gracie, call it.
[01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.790]  Click.
[01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:47.610]  All right, here we go.
[01:08:47.610 --> 01:08:49.850]  Our first spin is...
[01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:55.230]  1991.
[01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:01.210]  Okay, so irrelevant on...
[01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:02.890]  Do we want to remove it?
[01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:05.530]  No, you got to keep it because what if it's 1991 again, baby?
[01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:06.890]  It's truly random.
[01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:08.390]  All right, Gracie, let me know when.
[01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.930]  Click.
[01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:11.530]  Got it.
[01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:12.310]  All right, here we go.
[01:09:12.370 --> 01:09:13.190]  Our second spin.
[01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:14.730]  This is a weird episode.
[01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:16.910]  I'm not getting any clicks from you, Gavin.
[01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:17.830]  I'm very disappointed.
[01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:19.190]  I'm clicking like the second year.
[01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:20.110]  What are you talking about?
[01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:21.410]  What?
[01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:22.170]  1992!
[01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:24.730]  Oh my God, it's a human progression.
[01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:27.450]  This is so exciting.
[01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:30.150]  I'm clicking so much my fingers hurt.
[01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:31.310]  Are you serious?
[01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:32.690]  None of it's coming through.
[01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:33.270]  I'll click.
[01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.850]  I'll auto-click.
[01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:35.030]  All right, here we go.
[01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:36.030]  Gracie, you let me know when.
[01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:43.430]  Click.
[01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:51.750]  1978.
[01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:57.650]  And now this will be...
[01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:58.970]  our final spin.
[01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:00.890]  Let's take a bet.
[01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.330]  Pick a year.
[01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:04.090]  What year do you guys think it'll be?
[01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:05.410]  1988.
[01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:08.030]  Okay, oh, 1997, 98.
[01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:09.350]  Okay, 1986.
[01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:11.390]  Oh, that's good.
[01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:12.190]  2006.
[01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:14.830]  Okay, Gracie, what number do you think it's gonna be?
[01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:17.490]  I hope it's something when I was alive.
[01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:19.010]  So, anything she doesn't wanna know.
[01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:21.250]  I'm gonna say...
[01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:23.990]  Honestly, I'm gonna say 1995.
[01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:25.470]  That's gonna be my guess.
[01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:25.730]  Here we go.
[01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:26.530]  What is the winner get?
[01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:29.050]  I don't think anything.
[01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:31.270]  I think it's just a fun thing that we're doing.
[01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:34.890]  Brag, yeah, you get a brag about it.
[01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:37.230]  All right, Gracie, whenever you're ready.
[01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:39.510]  Okay, let me get ready.
[01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:47.590]  Here it comes.
[01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:50.810]  Our spin is winding down and it is...
[01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:52.270]  19...
[01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:52.910]  Oh, god damn!
[01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:54.010]  ...thousand!
[01:10:54.730 --> 01:10:55.290]  1964!
[01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:00.570]  Wow, 1964.
[01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:04.290]  I am so excited to see what Gracie will pick.
[01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:06.630]  I will have to do serious research.
[01:11:07.050 --> 01:11:07.710]  That's awesome.
[01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:10.150]  That's like before her parents were born.
[01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:11.270]  So that's pretty exciting.
[01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:13.110]  My parents were not born in that year.
[01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:14.170]  No, absolutely not.
[01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:16.910]  The worst movies of 1964.
[01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:19.890]  According to this list,
[01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:23.450]  Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is the worst movie.
[01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:25.970]  It's not just you, Murray.
[01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:30.590]  The incredible strange creatures who stopped living and became...
[01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:31.530]  What?
[01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:32.950]  Cut off.
[01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:33.930]  Who became...
[01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:35.230]  We will never know.
[01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:36.010]  Mixed up zombies.
[01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:37.990]  Didn't we watch Mystery Sites?
[01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:40.550]  The era of the people who stopped living and became...
[01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:41.230]  We might have.
[01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:42.690]  Back Door to Hell.
[01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:45.150]  Oh, there was a movie called Teenage Strangler.
[01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:46.030]  Whoa.
[01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:47.930]  Swedish Wedding Night.
[01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.670]  Ooh, la la.
[01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:51.010]  Poncho's Hideaway.
[01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:52.650]  Okay, so there's a lot of bad looking movies.
[01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.710]  The Creeping Terror.
[01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:54.550]  Oh, that's a classic.
[01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:56.290]  I said that one already.
[01:11:57.190 --> 01:11:58.390]  Did anyone hear him say Goldfinger?
[01:11:58.690 --> 01:11:58.970]  No.
[01:11:58.970 --> 01:12:01.950]  The Horror of Party Beach.
[01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:07.230]  Sloppy Seconds has a song about that movie.
[01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:13.390]  Well, Gracie, you'll have a lot to pick from, including Elvis Kissin' Cousins.
[01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:16.090]  So it can sort of be anything.
[01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:17.770]  It's up to you.
[01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:19.010]  Think long and hard.
[01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:21.990]  You have, I suppose, a week to let us know.
[01:12:22.090 --> 01:12:25.750]  I think we'll do our next recording and then we'll go from there.
[01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:28.390]  Then you can present the movie and then we can watch it whenever.
[01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:33.030]  And then after we've watched the movie, then the next person can spin the wheel.
[01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:34.230]  It's very exciting.
[01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:35.110]  We'll do it again.
[01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:35.630]  I like it.
[01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:40.010]  Yeah, and then I'm hoping, I think I was hoping more than anything,
[01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:41.790]  that the wheel would look cool.
[01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:42.730]  And I think it did.
[01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:45.090]  And that we'll find other ways to use it.
[01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:47.010]  Yeah, I loved it.
[01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:49.170]  Well, there you have it.
[01:12:49.290 --> 01:12:50.070]  That's the episode.
[01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:51.130]  Click.
[01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:55.410]  All right, you guys.
[01:12:56.130 --> 01:13:01.030]  Hey, as we're leaving, Eric and I got a pretty cool pull yesterday on the Break Show.
[01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.330]  Did you guys see that by any chance?
[01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:03.730]  I missed it.
[01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:09.010]  We pulled a Julius Caesar relic.
[01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:11.250]  A knife?
[01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:12.850]  A one of 99 knife?
[01:13:13.330 --> 01:13:16.970]  It's a piece of leather from a tunic that he wore.
[01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.970]  Wow.
[01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:24.610]  The now f*** face owns a piece of, like a legitimate piece of Julius Caesar's clothes.
[01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:27.590]  And then it has it's a piece of...
[01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:29.170]  That's what I'm saying, Gavin.
[01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:30.210]  There's no way.
[01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.910]  It is.
[01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:31.430]  There's no way.
[01:13:31.730 --> 01:13:36.170]  They buy them authenticated at auctions and then they cut them up.
[01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:38.050]  And they're all completely above board.
[01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:41.050]  It's f***ing, we own some Caesar, baby.
[01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:42.990]  That dude died before Jesus.
[01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:46.670]  Well, thanks for listening to F*** Face.
[01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:49.710]  Real strong ending on this one today.
[01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:50.890]  185.
[01:13:51.170 --> 01:13:53.630]  Gracie has to pick a movie from 1964.
[01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:55.690]  And we're very excited.
[01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:59.910]  You can follow us at F*** Face Pod on Instagram and on Twitter.
[01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:04.190]  And you can go to f***facepod.com and sign up to support us directly and watch our first stuff,
[01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:05.150]  which is Let's Plays.
[01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:06.610]  And that's pretty much it.
[01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:08.950]  Anything else so we can wrap this thing up?
[01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:10.930]  Gracie, have you ever seen a film that old?
[01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:13.410]  Actually, yes, in school.
[01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:14.870]  What's the old...
[01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:19.470]  You may not know it off the top of your head, but what's the oldest movie you've ever seen?
[01:14:21.650 --> 01:14:23.330]  Mmm, probably like It Happened One Night.
[01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.870]  Yeah.
[01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:25.830]  Okay, there you go.
[01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:28.190]  Hey, do you guys think we should do a murder draft?
[01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:29.310]  I was thinking about that.
[01:14:30.090 --> 01:14:30.350]  No.
[01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:31.150]  Best Murders?
[01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:34.170]  Because I'm going to be in the first round, so...
[01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:34.810]  That's true.
[01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:37.930]  I was also thinking, what if we did a person draft?
[01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:41.070]  Like, what if we just did a draft of, like, Nick Cage movies?
[01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:43.260]  You've, we've, you've...
[01:14:44.130 --> 01:14:44.870]  Pitched that before?
[01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.790]  I just like Nick Cage.
[01:14:46.410 --> 01:14:47.190]  I just like Nick Cage.
[01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:47.870]  I just want to do Nick Cage.
[01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:50.530]  Pitch that before, I'd argue, in a better format.
[01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:51.070]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:53.030]  Oh, the fight cage match thing?
[01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:53.350]  Yeah.
[01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:55.110]  When's the best episode going to be?
[01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:56.150]  Like, 187 or something?
[01:14:56.210 --> 01:14:57.210]  Oh my god!
[01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:58.290]  All right, bye!
[01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:59.150]  Bye!
[01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.390]  Goodbye!
[01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:05.230]  What about a year, a wheel of months?
[01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:06.270]  Oh my god, cut.
[01:15:06.570 --> 01:15:07.610]  Cut, cut, cut.
[01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:08.710]  Everyone stop.
[01:15:08.850 --> 01:15:09.230]  No more.
[01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:14.230]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:15.930]  How do you spike a heart rate?
[01:15:16.330 --> 01:15:17.430]  The intro happened.
[01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:18.730]  Cornhole anyone?
[01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:20.990]  Geoff forgot the butterfly pose.
[01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:22.310]  Accidental audio.
[01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:23.770]  Let's go ice skating.
[01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:26.190]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:29.230]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
