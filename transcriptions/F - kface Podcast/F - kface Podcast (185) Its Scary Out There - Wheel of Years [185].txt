[00:00.000 --> 00:01.200]  Hey guys, producer Eric here.
[00:01.320 --> 00:03.840]  Just want to run down some supplemental content for you.
[00:03.920 --> 00:08.020]  So check this out over on our YouTube channel and over in FacePod.com.
[00:08.060 --> 00:10.520]  You can go watch the second bean hole video,
[00:10.660 --> 00:14.940]  but that's not it because through December we have supplemental content for you.
[00:15.180 --> 00:18.660]  You can check out the Christmas movie draft that's over there.
[00:18.700 --> 00:22.920]  So is the Christmas music draft. That's all the stuff that's come out so far,
[00:23.020 --> 00:28.340]  but pretty soon we have the Christmas catalog of 98 browse through where we go
[00:28.340 --> 00:31.680]  through a cool Christmas catalog of 98. Check out some cool toys.
[00:31.840 --> 00:33.940]  It is very long. So prepare for that one.
[00:34.160 --> 00:37.260]  We also have the waxing video. That's right.
[00:37.320 --> 00:42.760]  The waxing has occurred and you will see the video of it on December the 30th
[00:42.760 --> 00:46.100]  and to bring you into the new year, as promised,
[00:46.400 --> 00:48.920]  we have two fruit throw videos,
[00:49.220 --> 00:54.340]  the true fruit throw video and then the fruit throw video with Andrew's
[00:54.340 --> 00:54.940]  commentary.
[00:55.340 --> 00:59.140]  And that's all coming your way on our YouTube channel and at FacePod.com.
[00:59.220 --> 01:00.980]  But enough of that stuff. Let's get to the show.
[01:11.460 --> 01:13.560]  This will be episode 185 by the way.
[01:13.720 --> 01:17.220]  And I have something written down that says talk about will wheel of years.
[01:17.720 --> 01:22.820]  So that's just a note before we get going. Let's talk about wheel of years.
[01:22.920 --> 01:26.300]  But you guys want to see something cool? Of course. Feet, feet, feet.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.240]  It worked. Holy shit. Holy fuck.
[01:32.240 --> 01:36.100]  Eric has unlocked the secret of how
[01:37.220 --> 01:42.060]  to summon Gavin whenever he wants to. It's worked two times now.
[01:42.960 --> 01:43.400]  Yeah.
[01:43.580 --> 01:47.240]  Is this the thing that you always talk about after I get hit or like,
[01:47.600 --> 01:48.880]  I don't know what you're talking about. What?
[01:52.480 --> 01:54.340]  Is this the thing you were talking about last time?
[01:54.800 --> 01:56.220]  You know, Gavin, how,
[01:56.420 --> 02:00.900]  you know how Columbus tricked a tribe of people because he knew an eclipse was
[02:00.900 --> 02:04.760]  coming and they didn't. And he leveraged that. Like you just knew.
[02:05.040 --> 02:08.740]  So they thought he had powers. Eric has done that with your being on time.
[02:09.500 --> 02:12.880]  Eric has a power over you that we didn't understand.
[02:13.440 --> 02:15.560]  Oh yeah? Well, let's see if he has that power next week.
[02:17.600 --> 02:20.020]  I'm not worried. I've been, I've been two for two with it.
[02:20.040 --> 02:24.580]  I might just retire on top. Retire at two? Okay. Yeah. I mean, maybe.
[02:24.700 --> 02:27.840]  Who knows? Honestly, let's see who remembers next week.
[02:31.540 --> 02:33.780]  But this is episode 185. Geoff, do the intro.
[02:34.180 --> 02:37.800]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[02:38.320 --> 02:42.920]  This is episode 185. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me as always,
[02:43.040 --> 02:46.020]  Andrew Payton and Gavin Free. Hello boys.
[02:46.200 --> 02:48.400]  Hello. Which was the one that we're meant to have?
[02:49.160 --> 02:51.460]  Is it 187 that was going to be the best episode of all time?
[02:51.600 --> 02:53.220]  We did this last week. No, that's the Merc episode.
[02:53.380 --> 02:56.820]  What are we talking about? It's like 196. 196? Wait, what?
[02:56.920 --> 02:57.960]  Are we in a time loop?
[02:58.520 --> 03:02.220]  This is, isn't this how literally last week's episode started?
[03:02.360 --> 03:05.160]  Am I insane? No, you're absolutely correct.
[03:05.280 --> 03:08.940]  Yeah, with Gavin asking the question, I believe. You literally did the exact same thing last week.
[03:09.020 --> 03:11.540]  And Eric did the... What is going on?
[03:11.620 --> 03:14.620]  How do you think I lock it in? Because it's not sticking. Make it stick.
[03:14.640 --> 03:17.840]  I don't know. So anyway, we'll see who remembers our thing for next week.
[03:18.060 --> 03:18.820]  Oh my God.
[03:21.520 --> 03:26.640]  I'll be honest, my, uh, I can hear myself slightly delayed in my headphones
[03:26.640 --> 03:29.440]  and I'm barely able to speak. I don't know what's going on.
[03:29.720 --> 03:31.660]  Are you like that lady on that newscast?
[03:32.700 --> 03:34.940]  Oh, the Tip Derritson thing?
[03:35.520 --> 03:37.680]  Yeah. Votation. Votation? Damn.
[03:39.100 --> 03:41.260]  Do you need to, uh, do you need to fix it?
[03:41.540 --> 03:43.640]  I mean, you can like, you can step out and fix it and stuff.
[03:43.760 --> 03:47.340]  You can step out. Yeah. I'll figure it out. Just, uh, I'll just tell...
[03:47.700 --> 03:48.780]  All right, man. We'll see you later.
[03:48.940 --> 03:51.660]  Okay. Yeah. We'll talk to you later, Gavin. Nice having you here.
[03:51.660 --> 03:53.260]  We'll keep going here. If you, if you figure it out, you can come back.
[03:55.980 --> 04:02.100]  Speaking of figuring it out, uh, I'm proud to say Chuck's been working lately. A little bit.
[04:02.180 --> 04:06.600]  Yeah? Yeah, we played till like 2 a.m. last night. It only crashed twice.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.380]  But dude, in four hours? That's pretty fucking good for me.
[04:12.120 --> 04:15.760]  Sometimes they crash nine times in 30 minutes. That's actually incredible.
[04:16.420 --> 04:18.800]  Yeah. Yeah. Two nights in a row. It's been like real smooth.
[04:19.440 --> 04:22.780]  That game is good and that's the worst part because I was having fun.
[04:22.780 --> 04:28.160]  I tried to play some trucks to just get, get my grips on it and I was having a good time
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.680]  and then I was in the middle of a mission and I was on the last part and it just crashed on me
[04:32.680 --> 04:38.340]  and I was confronted with, do I want to give my heart to this thing that Geoff has in the way that
[04:38.340 --> 04:44.300]  he has knowing the pain and that this is going to constantly happen and I don't think I can do it.
[04:44.700 --> 04:48.040]  I think I'm going to pop in and out in trucks and have fun when I'm there, but I can't commit.
[04:48.400 --> 04:49.560]  But you're out for now? Because of the crashing.
[04:49.560 --> 04:55.520]  So here's the nice thing about it. We've developed workarounds so that it minimizes the fuckery.
[04:56.080 --> 05:00.140]  So we only play in Antonio's trucks on Antonio's map.
[05:00.280 --> 05:04.820]  That way, if I get kicked or Burndog gets kicked or if either you play and you get kicked,
[05:05.320 --> 05:08.880]  the truck and the items stay exactly where they were when you got kicked.
[05:08.960 --> 05:11.360]  So you just come back in and you pick up where you left off.
[05:11.540 --> 05:14.100]  You just have to give up on the idea of using your own vehicles,
[05:14.220 --> 05:16.620]  which is totally, totally fine because they're all the same anyway.
[05:18.380 --> 05:21.560]  Okay, it's just a progression thing. Have you ever played single player?
[05:21.660 --> 05:23.900]  Do you know if it crashes as much in the single player mode?
[05:24.140 --> 05:26.460]  It does not. I play single player sometimes.
[05:27.920 --> 05:30.740]  If I have like 30 minutes to kill, I'll knock out a mission here and there.
[05:30.820 --> 05:32.800]  It's only crashed on me once in single player.
[05:33.380 --> 05:35.340]  Oh, wow. Maybe you'll look at that.
[05:36.140 --> 05:38.820]  Gavin, do you think we should partner up in the franchises?
[05:39.440 --> 05:42.700]  Since we're doing, you know, new episode, new material, any restaurants?
[05:44.200 --> 05:45.440]  So melting pot, right?
[05:46.260 --> 05:48.040]  Yes, yes, the melting pot.
[05:48.800 --> 05:53.620]  It was a mistake to attempt to buy a melting pot, let me tell you.
[05:53.780 --> 05:54.540]  And I don't know.
[05:55.000 --> 05:55.980]  Oh, do you have an update?
[05:56.620 --> 05:59.200]  Oh, I've got, I got 25 updates.
[05:59.600 --> 06:05.780]  I've been getting emails from the melting pot every day about you should get this franchise.
[06:06.400 --> 06:11.640]  And I haven't been reading them for the most part because they're kind of,
[06:12.240 --> 06:14.140]  they're bracketed in a weird way.
[06:14.140 --> 06:15.680]  Do you think you could get them down?
[06:15.780 --> 06:19.140]  Because 500,000 is a really, really round number.
[06:19.600 --> 06:21.580]  Uh, well, maybe.
[06:21.840 --> 06:25.120]  I didn't consider that as an option because I don't want a melting pot.
[06:25.420 --> 06:29.660]  And you also don't want one, which is the weirdest part about this whole thing.
[06:31.060 --> 06:37.580]  Just as a reminder, I said, I put in a fictional city as to where I wanted one,
[06:37.720 --> 06:41.660]  said I didn't have the money, didn't know anyone that did,
[06:41.660 --> 06:45.900]  and I've only done this because a friend told me that it was a good idea.
[06:46.160 --> 06:47.800]  And I've been getting all these emails.
[06:48.500 --> 06:53.340]  And I noticed one of them said, like, I'd love to call you next week
[06:53.340 --> 06:56.120]  so we can have a talk about this opportunity.
[06:56.480 --> 06:59.500]  And I thought they surely are not going to call, but they did.
[06:59.920 --> 07:01.520]  They in fact did call.
[07:02.260 --> 07:03.960]  And I did not answer.
[07:04.360 --> 07:05.340]  Oh, come on.
[07:06.360 --> 07:10.520]  But I have a voicemail from them that I can try to play.
[07:10.520 --> 07:14.340]  The speaker on my phone is not the best, but I'll attempt to.
[07:14.360 --> 07:14.840]  You're going to play a voice?
[07:14.960 --> 07:18.320]  You're going to play a corporate voicemail from someone unbeknownst to them?
[07:18.800 --> 07:19.480]  Yeah, from the melting pot.
[07:19.780 --> 07:21.740]  Just do a voice change on it.
[07:22.560 --> 07:23.840]  Yeah, and Nick will fix it in post.
[07:24.100 --> 07:26.660]  Yeah, just do a voice change.
[07:26.800 --> 07:29.280]  Just press the voice change button.
[07:29.420 --> 07:29.960]  How about this?
[07:30.040 --> 07:30.420]  How about this?
[07:30.480 --> 07:33.500]  We'll have Jack re-perform the voicemail.
[07:33.920 --> 07:35.620]  Why can't we use the voicemail?
[07:35.840 --> 07:36.980]  Well, because, I don't know, consent.
[07:37.220 --> 07:37.420]  I don't know.
[07:37.940 --> 07:39.860]  Yeah, you probably need consent from this person.
[07:39.860 --> 07:46.240]  I mean, to me, it's less even consent and more like we're really hammering the melting pot
[07:46.240 --> 07:48.320]  and this person's just doing their job.
[07:48.920 --> 07:53.360]  Yeah, that too. I like the idea of Jack's reenactment.
[07:54.320 --> 07:57.860]  Right, but that's going to be so much work for everyone to try to get Jack to do something,
[07:57.960 --> 07:58.240]  isn't it?
[07:58.960 --> 08:00.500]  You get someone who's easier to get.
[08:01.120 --> 08:04.260]  Hey, Andrew, this is Alan over at Melting Pot Franchising.
[08:04.440 --> 08:07.340]  I saw that you sent over an inquiry not too recently.
[08:07.340 --> 08:10.500]  I wanted to reach out and talk to you about opportunities we see.
[08:11.200 --> 08:14.160]  Feel free to give me a call back if you're interested in learning about the process
[08:14.160 --> 08:15.600]  and becoming a franchise owner yourself.
[08:15.960 --> 08:20.140]  I'm available at **** or my cell phone.
[08:22.280 --> 08:24.800]  Thank you so much, and I look forward to talking to you.
[08:24.960 --> 08:25.300]  Bye-bye.
[08:26.280 --> 08:28.420]  Yeah, we'll definitely cut out the phone numbers.
[08:29.040 --> 08:30.300]  The phone numbers can't be on.
[08:31.540 --> 08:36.700]  I'm going to tell you right now, just based on that phone call, that guy will not like you.
[08:37.520 --> 08:41.380]  No, well, he texted me as well.
[08:41.460 --> 08:43.100]  They're gagging for it.
[08:43.700 --> 08:45.120]  After that, and...
[08:45.540 --> 08:47.040]  He's really good at his job.
[08:47.740 --> 08:52.620]  He said, hi, Andrew, this is blank blank at Melting Pot.
[08:53.100 --> 08:56.880]  What about Nanaimo makes you think a melting pot would flourish there?
[08:56.980 --> 08:57.540]  Was the question.
[08:58.260 --> 09:02.720]  To which I replied, I personally don't think Nanaimo would be a good location,
[09:02.900 --> 09:04.960]  but my friend Gavin thinks we should get one.
[09:05.240 --> 09:07.080]  The hurdle is we don't have any money.
[09:08.480 --> 09:14.160]  There were a building or building or plans or really a want to.
[09:14.300 --> 09:16.100]  I mean, there's a lot of hurdles, but yeah.
[09:16.820 --> 09:18.380]  Their reply to that was, I see.
[09:18.960 --> 09:23.020]  Well, I have a partnership matchmaking program where I can place you with someone
[09:23.020 --> 09:27.060]  who would be interested in finding operators for a new build.
[09:27.520 --> 09:29.460]  Would you want to discuss that opportunity?
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.220]  And I replied, no, thank you.
[09:32.220 --> 09:33.980]  Oh, come on.
[09:34.360 --> 09:39.740]  Andrew is going to accidentally open a melting pot store.
[09:40.080 --> 09:44.960]  You are you are on the cusp of doing the funniest thing.
[09:45.060 --> 09:46.920]  What happened to the yes and?
[09:47.520 --> 09:52.860]  Well, no, it's you can yes and you can fill out your own application if you if you really want.
[09:53.080 --> 09:54.120]  I'm already on yours now.
[09:55.040 --> 09:57.420]  Andrew, you're on the cusp of ownership.
[09:57.800 --> 09:59.680]  No, it's over. I've said no, thank you.
[09:59.700 --> 10:01.400]  And his response was heard.
[10:01.400 --> 10:03.120]  Thank you for your interest.
[10:04.040 --> 10:05.400]  Oh, you should reply.
[10:05.560 --> 10:06.940]  I had absolutely no interest.
[10:07.420 --> 10:09.240]  No, I said thank you.
[10:09.340 --> 10:13.040]  But you could respond with I've had second thoughts.
[10:13.540 --> 10:14.780]  I could later.
[10:15.100 --> 10:18.280]  Yeah, but this is once again, this is just a man doing his job.
[10:18.380 --> 10:18.980]  So I don't want to.
[10:19.880 --> 10:22.960]  I feel like we follow this thing through its natural end.
[10:22.980 --> 10:24.440]  I don't want to just mess with this person.
[10:29.280 --> 10:32.360]  I'm messing with other people is what's happening.
[10:33.340 --> 10:35.600]  Nick's Nick is making me laugh in the discord.
[10:35.860 --> 10:38.400]  You should just respond with you son of a bitch.
[10:38.600 --> 10:39.340]  I'm back in.
[10:42.660 --> 10:44.540]  I'd love to, but I don't want to.
[10:44.840 --> 10:48.260]  He's going to place you with somebody who's got the seed money.
[10:48.460 --> 10:52.000]  But I don't want I'm scared of that accidentally happening.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.280]  Are you worried that he works on commission?
[10:55.880 --> 10:56.320]  What?
[10:56.680 --> 10:59.080]  Well, he probably gets paid no matter what happens with you.
[10:59.500 --> 11:01.460]  Yeah, but I'm wasting his time.
[11:01.840 --> 11:03.160]  What are you afraid of success?
[11:03.600 --> 11:08.120]  Are you afraid of being a busy businessman who owns his own melting pot?
[11:08.200 --> 11:10.380]  And by the way, probably gets to eat there for free.
[11:10.900 --> 11:13.080]  Are you scared of getting an invoice for $500,000?
[11:14.500 --> 11:17.680]  Oh, we just get the air card if that happened.
[11:17.840 --> 11:20.400]  But we certainly wouldn't. Absolutely not.
[11:20.600 --> 11:21.060]  What do you mean?
[11:21.060 --> 11:24.000]  I'm not paying an invoice for $500,000.
[11:24.460 --> 11:27.500]  It's a good point. That should be the it's not for the show.
[11:27.520 --> 11:28.440]  It's for Andrew.
[11:28.860 --> 11:33.220]  No, but it is for the show because Andrew's for the show.
[11:33.480 --> 11:36.100]  But I think what Eric's getting at is he doesn't do that stuff anymore.
[11:36.180 --> 11:37.220]  He has grace to do it.
[11:37.360 --> 11:39.720]  So I think what he's trying to say is Gracie.
[11:39.880 --> 11:41.680]  Oh, yeah, there you go. See, Gracie's got the car.
[11:41.780 --> 11:46.120]  Gracie loves the last thing Gracie ever purchased.
[11:47.440 --> 11:49.680]  A $500,000 melting pot.
[11:49.680 --> 11:51.240]  Gracie, how do you feel about fondue?
[11:51.820 --> 11:53.940]  Liquid cheese is my favorite thing. So I'm in.
[11:54.320 --> 11:56.200]  OK, there we go. We got to go.
[11:57.140 --> 12:00.880]  I'm going to reply to Colin later tonight and let him know, even though I blanked his name.
[12:01.120 --> 12:04.960]  I got an investor.
[12:06.320 --> 12:07.720]  But we're going to we.
[12:08.360 --> 12:10.840]  What if you send him the 16 digits from the card?
[12:11.220 --> 12:13.240]  She's an associate producer.
[12:13.620 --> 12:15.460]  Can we put this on credit?
[12:16.060 --> 12:18.800]  She's about to be producing melting pots is what she's going to be producing.
[12:18.800 --> 12:20.400]  Can we can we?
[12:20.640 --> 12:25.060]  I know it's a franchise, but can we get a permission to rename it a regulation melting pot?
[12:25.160 --> 12:27.080]  Oh, these are all great questions.
[12:27.120 --> 12:28.620]  I feel like that'll help us stand out.
[12:29.360 --> 12:30.720]  Because you guys really want it.
[12:30.780 --> 12:35.280]  I'll do at least one more text in this town and we'll see what happens.
[12:35.280 --> 12:39.200]  But I really don't want to continue to pester unless he's open to it.
[12:39.260 --> 12:40.140]  If he has fun.
[12:40.280 --> 12:44.280]  You said that this guy would not like me, Geoff, which makes me think we should not do this.
[12:44.700 --> 12:45.380]  But no, yeah, he doesn't.
[12:45.460 --> 12:46.440]  He already doesn't like you.
[12:46.440 --> 12:50.000]  Before even the text, I could tell by his voice, he didn't like you.
[12:50.000 --> 12:50.540]  I could swing the tone.
[12:50.960 --> 12:52.360]  You guys would not hang out?
[12:53.320 --> 12:54.200]  No, maybe.
[12:54.700 --> 12:57.820]  None of this would have happened if they put a little bit of space between their book a
[12:57.820 --> 12:59.780]  reservation and buy a restaurant on the website.
[13:01.740 --> 13:02.900]  I forgot about that.
[13:03.300 --> 13:04.460]  I forgot why this even started.
[13:04.460 --> 13:06.320]  Let's not forget how we ended up down this little spiral.
[13:09.520 --> 13:10.400]  Oh, God.
[13:11.260 --> 13:14.660]  I, uh, I woke up to a great email the other day,
[13:14.660 --> 13:17.760]  which I was more than willing to mess with.
[13:18.180 --> 13:26.680]  I woke up to a like eight email chain for a thing related to the stinky dragon,
[13:27.340 --> 13:33.120]  and it was the strangest first email where it was like, you've agreed to do this work
[13:33.120 --> 13:35.160]  and it needs to be sent in by Tuesday.
[13:35.580 --> 13:37.680]  What is your rate for doing this?
[13:38.100 --> 13:39.840]  And it was for PNGs.
[13:40.020 --> 13:42.120]  And I was like, what is going on?
[13:42.120 --> 13:43.140]  I didn't agree.
[13:44.300 --> 13:45.620]  PNG is a photo, right?
[13:45.680 --> 13:46.740]  I think that's an image thing.
[13:47.200 --> 13:48.940]  Why am I expected to do photo?
[13:49.020 --> 13:55.320]  And so I'm trying to like read up and down the chain of like when this was pitched,
[13:55.360 --> 13:56.900]  because I never got the pitch email.
[13:57.080 --> 13:59.960]  Like this is clearly at the end of the thing to wrap it up.
[14:00.100 --> 14:01.080]  And I'm reading that.
[14:01.220 --> 14:07.460]  And then Blaine is giving additional instructions to me as a side thing that's following up.
[14:07.500 --> 14:11.560]  It's like, Andrew, when you do this, we really want this type of style to it.
[14:11.560 --> 14:13.520]  And I'm completely baffled.
[14:13.700 --> 14:17.640]  And then I realized, oh, this is this is somebody.
[14:17.900 --> 14:19.800]  There are multiple Andrews at the company.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.940]  There's also somebody who is Andrew Douglas, which is my middle name.
[14:24.180 --> 14:26.140]  There's a second Andrew Douglas.
[14:26.500 --> 14:31.520]  And I got accidentally roped in on the final chain of this email,
[14:31.640 --> 14:34.440]  of them finalizing the contract for them doing this work.
[14:34.440 --> 14:40.520]  They they emailed Andrew Pantin thinking that he's my old roommate and friend,
[14:40.900 --> 14:43.900]  Andrew Douglas, who does the art for Stinky Dragon.
[14:44.720 --> 14:46.900]  Nobody stopped to check.
[14:47.280 --> 14:52.600]  They just kept emailing Andrew Pantin going, draw this stuff.
[14:52.660 --> 14:53.380]  What are you doing?
[14:54.040 --> 14:58.600]  Well, what was weird is I wish that was the case because I would have understood what was going on.
[14:58.880 --> 15:00.520]  They had sent it the right way.
[15:00.600 --> 15:02.620]  Ninety five percent of the way.
[15:02.620 --> 15:08.420]  And then on the one yard line just threw my email in when asking what the rate would be.
[15:08.800 --> 15:09.480]  So did you get it done?
[15:09.860 --> 15:11.780]  Well, here's the thing. I was very confused.
[15:12.400 --> 15:16.080]  I would have quoted a very aggressive rate if I were you.
[15:16.380 --> 15:21.680]  Well, I it went through a process of first panic that I was expected to do this work
[15:21.680 --> 15:25.040]  that I didn't understand what it was and that it was due the next day.
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.720]  Then just confusion for what the actual task was that I was supposed to be doing.
[15:30.720 --> 15:33.320]  Then I understood what happened.
[15:33.800 --> 15:37.360]  And I said that I'd be willing to do the work for six times,
[15:37.400 --> 15:40.200]  whatever the other Andrew Douglas was asking for.
[15:40.440 --> 15:42.340]  But it would be 10,000 times worse.
[15:42.640 --> 15:46.340]  And they did not take me as a serious negotiator.
[15:46.660 --> 15:49.380]  I also said that any further negotiations would be half the
[15:49.380 --> 15:52.660]  would have to go through johnny.caviar at roosterteeth.com.
[15:53.200 --> 15:54.480]  Smart. That's smart.
[15:54.580 --> 15:56.300]  They did not follow through on that either.
[15:56.300 --> 16:01.140]  To be clear, I just want everyone to know like Andrew draws like this stuff.
[16:01.220 --> 16:02.940]  It's like, here's a cat, a crazy bird man.
[16:03.100 --> 16:05.900]  And they're just emailing and going, this got to get done tomorrow.
[16:06.200 --> 16:07.640]  And it's this is what a mess.
[16:07.880 --> 16:16.140]  I was tempted to attempt to draw things for based on the guideline, but it would do too bad.
[16:16.760 --> 16:17.780]  Dude, you should have.
[16:17.900 --> 16:19.840]  That would have been funny just to turn your work in.
[16:20.540 --> 16:22.420]  Maybe I will. Maybe I can turn it.
[16:22.480 --> 16:25.080]  It would have been funny, except it would have pushed them up against
[16:25.080 --> 16:27.080]  some sort of a deadline that would have totally fucked them.
[16:28.020 --> 16:29.520]  They're probably already fucked.
[16:29.640 --> 16:34.240]  They wasted a day emailing Andrew's cat and going, you have to get this done tomorrow, Andrew.
[16:34.640 --> 16:35.880]  Yeah, they already sent it to the wrong Andrew.
[16:35.960 --> 16:39.260]  I feel like you should throw in some work just to help him out.
[16:39.680 --> 16:44.840]  You think maybe I should like throw in some work and be like, hey, just, you know, in the future.
[16:44.940 --> 16:49.580]  I know this is a mistake, but you know, if you ever need a guy, if you ever need a guy looking
[16:49.580 --> 16:52.240]  straight up, you should attach your artwork along with the invoice.
[16:52.580 --> 16:53.720]  OK, I'll do that.
[16:53.720 --> 16:58.240]  Do you have any other Andrew Douglas pieces, Eric?
[16:58.800 --> 16:59.960]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[16:59.980 --> 17:05.900]  Can you send me like three and I'll recreate them and then I can show them to you guys what I send them.
[17:06.220 --> 17:09.160]  OK, hang on. OK, we're going to I'm going to send you you can recreate.
[17:09.440 --> 17:11.040]  So there's that. That's from Stinky Dragon.
[17:11.120 --> 17:12.260]  I want to give you some of his portfolio.
[17:12.680 --> 17:12.940]  So it's a cat.
[17:13.060 --> 17:15.200]  Yeah, and a bird man.
[17:15.820 --> 17:17.960]  Here's his here's his Twitter avatar.
[17:19.640 --> 17:22.540]  OK, that's like it's like a it's like a
[17:22.540 --> 17:28.060]  green man with a big tongue, big eyes, horns and a baseball cap.
[17:28.260 --> 17:30.180]  So that so there's that zombie guy.
[17:30.580 --> 17:35.060]  Uh huh. And then let's see what else I actually feel good about that one.
[17:35.160 --> 17:37.760]  I think I could do I think I could do that one.
[17:38.140 --> 17:40.800]  OK, and then here's here's one that I think you can do.
[17:40.880 --> 17:43.520]  Also, this is more of his sketchy sort of stuff
[17:44.500 --> 17:47.580]  where he's sort of deteriorating, become a skeleton man.
[17:47.640 --> 17:48.480]  And he says, that's it.
[17:48.500 --> 17:50.120]  I'm officially hangry.
[17:50.380 --> 17:51.720]  OK, got it.
[17:51.720 --> 17:53.900]  That one's there's not even color in that.
[17:54.020 --> 17:54.620]  No, no, no, no.
[17:54.620 --> 17:56.700]  A lot of his stuff is mostly black and white stuff.
[17:56.740 --> 17:57.740]  And I really like it.
[17:58.000 --> 17:58.860]  And yeah, it's great.
[17:58.900 --> 17:59.500]  It looks great.
[17:59.900 --> 18:00.340]  Yeah, he does.
[18:00.440 --> 18:01.360]  He does really, really good.
[18:01.440 --> 18:06.340]  So you follow up at Angimoto, A-N-G-I-M-O-T-O if you want to check out his stuff.
[18:06.420 --> 18:08.620]  He did all the stuff for Good Morning from Hell also.
[18:09.140 --> 18:12.180]  And then he just naturally folded over into this.
[18:12.240 --> 18:13.260]  He's just maybe an artist.
[18:13.680 --> 18:16.360]  Maybe you could reimagine Ian as a skull.
[18:17.780 --> 18:19.120]  Yeah, I like that idea.
[18:20.080 --> 18:24.040]  He here's one where he drew me yelling at him to press the X button.
[18:27.540 --> 18:30.200]  While we're doing the Andrew commercial,
[18:30.200 --> 18:33.780]  should we also mention that he helped pick up home runs when we were hitting the balls?
[18:33.780 --> 18:34.280]  He did, yeah.
[18:35.580 --> 18:39.120]  He was there shagging balls for us when Geoff was hitting dingers.
[18:39.600 --> 18:40.640]  Yeah, he was doing what?
[18:41.640 --> 18:43.100]  He was fucking the baseballs.
[18:43.120 --> 18:43.500]  You're British.
[18:43.720 --> 18:46.460]  He was fucking baseballs while Geoff was hitting them with a baseball bat.
[18:46.460 --> 18:47.920]  Sorry, I didn't mean to confuse you, man.
[18:48.480 --> 18:51.040]  I like that panel of all the X buttons from all the consoles.
[18:51.200 --> 18:53.480]  Yeah, that's me.
[18:53.600 --> 18:55.500]  That's an actual thing where we were playing Zelda.
[18:55.560 --> 18:57.060]  He was playing Zelda, I was watching him.
[18:57.280 --> 18:58.840]  And then he's like, I don't know how to beat this guy.
[18:59.140 --> 19:01.580]  And that's me yelling at him to press X.
[19:01.880 --> 19:05.140]  And him stressing the fuck out.
[19:05.480 --> 19:10.760]  He's the only guy that I've met that doesn't like NFL Red Zone.
[19:11.300 --> 19:14.120]  He told me, it's too many games, man.
[19:14.280 --> 19:15.480]  It stresses me out.
[19:17.200 --> 19:18.540]  It is all the games.
[19:18.860 --> 19:20.880]  Right, but that's the point.
[19:21.240 --> 19:24.380]  Too much of something does freak me out too.
[19:25.400 --> 19:27.100]  That's why he doesn't like forests.
[19:27.540 --> 19:28.420]  Too many trees.
[19:29.060 --> 19:35.880]  I get really anxious and it makes me kind of want to vomit when if I'm like on Google Maps
[19:35.880 --> 19:41.000]  and I zoom in to the middle of nowhere and like find a school or something.
[19:41.500 --> 19:44.340]  And I'm just like, how would I ever find this again?
[19:44.340 --> 19:50.220]  And the fact that the earth is so big and I could get lost on the map from my own office.
[19:50.360 --> 19:51.240]  It just freaks me out.
[19:51.500 --> 19:52.220]  Makes me want to throw up.
[19:53.680 --> 19:56.700]  But you've created all the stress in this scenario.
[19:56.960 --> 19:59.580]  All of the anxiety is manufactured by you.
[20:00.100 --> 20:00.780]  It just makes me uneasy.
[20:00.780 --> 20:02.240]  You never need to find that school again.
[20:02.600 --> 20:03.500]  It doesn't matter.
[20:03.780 --> 20:06.420]  The location of the school is completely irrelevant to your life.
[20:06.700 --> 20:08.120]  You don't need to worry about that.
[20:08.360 --> 20:11.340]  And then I start thinking about how long it would take me to get there.
[20:11.380 --> 20:13.700]  If I really had to get there right now, it'd be probably days.
[20:13.700 --> 20:14.960]  That's insane.
[20:15.360 --> 20:16.560]  I can kind of relate.
[20:17.100 --> 20:18.720]  Do you foresee needing to get there?
[20:19.400 --> 20:19.700]  No.
[20:20.120 --> 20:20.760]  Well, I hope not.
[20:21.560 --> 20:25.160]  I have dreams where I will be like, I'm trying to get home
[20:25.160 --> 20:28.420]  and then I'll get lost or I'll like go on the wrong boat.
[20:28.680 --> 20:29.900]  And I'll go, oh, fuck.
[20:30.020 --> 20:30.700]  Now, how am I?
[20:30.900 --> 20:32.900]  This is going to take so much longer to get home.
[20:33.020 --> 20:35.380]  And then I'll realize, oh, wait, I'm sleeping.
[20:35.500 --> 20:36.680]  I'm in my bed sleeping.
[20:37.060 --> 20:38.720]  If I just wake up, I'm home.
[20:38.760 --> 20:42.700]  And then I wake up and go, fuck yeah, immediate, immediately back.
[20:42.700 --> 20:46.840]  So I kind of understand, but it's a strange thing.
[20:47.180 --> 20:48.880]  I don't know why you're worried about this school.
[20:49.540 --> 20:50.840]  I'm going to try and find it again.
[20:51.240 --> 20:51.720]  You should.
[20:52.200 --> 20:55.320]  It's a little weird that you're obsessed with a school, but...
[20:55.320 --> 20:56.320]  It was just what I found.
[20:57.480 --> 21:00.380]  Okay, but you seem to really want to go there is the issue.
[21:00.940 --> 21:02.060]  What are you looking to learn?
[21:02.860 --> 21:04.960]  Oh, Gavin is sharing his screen.
[21:05.480 --> 21:06.660]  We're going to Earth.
[21:07.060 --> 21:09.680]  So I think I remember where it was, but it really freaked me out.
[21:09.820 --> 21:10.820]  Like, let me know if this freaks you out.
[21:10.820 --> 21:13.640]  There's a school and it's like...
[21:14.540 --> 21:16.280]  So we're zooming into the Earth right now.
[21:16.660 --> 21:17.800]  Yeah, and I think it's like...
[21:19.160 --> 21:22.420]  This is just water, it appears.
[21:26.060 --> 21:27.360]  What is going on?
[21:27.680 --> 21:28.820]  Okay, we're zooming in.
[21:29.220 --> 21:33.300]  This is like the intro credit scene to a Tony Scott movie.
[21:33.880 --> 21:36.620]  Oh, this is absolutely... Jason Bourne is about to pop up.
[21:36.840 --> 21:37.720]  I'm very excited.
[21:38.240 --> 21:41.520]  But like, let's just show in the middle of nowhere.
[21:41.520 --> 21:43.460]  Look, can you imagine going in there?
[21:43.900 --> 21:44.100]  No.
[21:45.200 --> 21:46.240]  That's crazy.
[21:46.780 --> 21:47.660]  Nick, Nick...
[21:47.660 --> 21:49.460]  It's too big, the world's too big.
[21:49.840 --> 21:51.020]  Nick is going, no.
[21:51.700 --> 21:55.460]  What is in an active school?
[21:55.860 --> 21:57.400]  I don't know anything about this school.
[21:57.480 --> 21:58.300]  It just freaked me out.
[22:00.000 --> 22:01.300]  Oh my God.
[22:01.360 --> 22:02.080]  You're insane.
[22:04.140 --> 22:05.840]  It's so weird.
[22:07.560 --> 22:11.260]  Gavin has been getting weirder and weirder.
[22:11.260 --> 22:14.860]  The episodes go on for the last like this fall.
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.200]  It's been like, it's been like odd Gavin fall.
[22:19.780 --> 22:21.000]  Oh my God.
[22:21.340 --> 22:24.500]  Do you just zoom into a random places on Google Maps?
[22:24.660 --> 22:25.820]  Go, oh, it's a building.
[22:26.140 --> 22:27.360]  It's a warehouse.
[22:27.820 --> 22:30.200]  Andrew, that's almost exactly what happens.
[22:31.080 --> 22:32.580]  I don't understand.
[22:33.860 --> 22:34.840]  Well, stop.
[22:34.980 --> 22:36.420]  It's clearly freaking you out.
[22:37.360 --> 22:39.080]  Why do you continue to do it?
[22:39.280 --> 22:41.160]  What are you gaining from this experience?
[22:41.260 --> 22:43.100]  I don't know.
[22:43.180 --> 22:46.260]  I'm interested in geography, but it's scary out there.
[22:46.440 --> 22:48.160]  Well, just don't zoom in.
[22:48.400 --> 22:49.540]  Just stay at a distance.
[22:50.820 --> 22:53.020]  But it's, it's scary out there.
[22:53.120 --> 22:53.980]  You're not out there.
[22:54.060 --> 22:55.520]  You're so safe in here.
[22:55.940 --> 22:56.200]  Yeah.
[22:56.220 --> 22:58.180]  I just get really thankful afterwards.
[22:58.340 --> 22:58.820]  I'm just like.
[23:01.440 --> 23:04.500]  Thank God you didn't have to go to a school in the middle of nowhere, huh?
[23:05.120 --> 23:05.400]  Yeah.
[23:05.400 --> 23:09.540]  Like what if, what about when you're flying and like you're, you look out the window and you
[23:09.540 --> 23:12.640]  see like things that you might not place.
[23:12.800 --> 23:14.020]  Well, like a turkey sandwich?
[23:14.100 --> 23:14.460]  Do you get freaked out by that?
[23:14.820 --> 23:17.040]  Well, yeah, like a turkey sandwich is a good one.
[23:17.240 --> 23:24.840]  Or like I know when I fly to Arizona, you see like a lot of just random industrial type
[23:24.840 --> 23:26.180]  buildings in the desert.
[23:26.420 --> 23:27.720]  And I always think that's interesting.
[23:27.960 --> 23:29.420]  I think about who works there.
[23:29.680 --> 23:30.440]  It's not scary to me.
[23:31.220 --> 23:36.540]  I always, I always think of how soft everything looks and how it's not really soft and it bums
[23:36.540 --> 23:37.260]  me out.
[23:38.440 --> 23:42.500]  And from an airplane, green stuff looks like if you like, oh, I just roll around and that
[23:42.500 --> 23:44.140]  would be like fucking super soft, but it's not.
[23:44.400 --> 23:45.200]  It's not really soft.
[23:45.300 --> 23:46.740]  It's super hard and pokey.
[23:48.040 --> 23:49.180]  I wonder why.
[23:49.260 --> 23:51.080]  Is it because you know where that is?
[23:51.740 --> 23:55.640]  Like when you're flying, like it feels like you could recreate your ability to get back
[23:55.640 --> 23:55.860]  there.
[23:55.920 --> 23:59.440]  I'm curious what aspect of this is actually your anxiety?
[24:00.580 --> 24:02.180]  What are you afraid of?
[24:02.680 --> 24:03.560]  It's the zooming.
[24:04.020 --> 24:06.720]  Like when you're on a plane, there's no zoom factor.
[24:06.720 --> 24:13.220]  So if you had binoculars and you were on a plane and you could zoom in, it would get
[24:13.220 --> 24:13.960]  really scary.
[24:14.380 --> 24:15.980]  No, I think it's more zooming out that scares me.
[24:16.780 --> 24:20.360]  Oh, it's the feeling of insignificance and small.
[24:20.740 --> 24:20.960]  Yeah.
[24:21.040 --> 24:22.660]  Just feeling all tiny.
[24:23.360 --> 24:24.980]  We're getting to your rational point of thought.
[24:25.100 --> 24:26.400]  That feels understandable to me.
[24:27.260 --> 24:29.040]  You ever like when you look up at the stars?
[24:29.260 --> 24:30.040]  Yeah, I understand.
[24:30.260 --> 24:30.460]  Yeah.
[24:31.220 --> 24:33.320]  You look into the stars to me is less scary.
[24:34.080 --> 24:34.420]  Really?
[24:34.420 --> 24:37.840]  Because I can't because I don't have any equipment to look deeper.
[24:38.520 --> 24:40.040]  Sounds to me like you need a telescope.
[24:40.580 --> 24:42.000]  Yeah, that would freak me out probably.
[24:42.520 --> 24:42.940]  It would.
[24:45.140 --> 24:47.020]  I thought I thought you had a telescope.
[24:48.040 --> 24:48.980]  He definitely has.
[24:49.140 --> 24:50.160]  He's Mr. Science.
[24:50.360 --> 24:52.260]  He's going to do the whole thing.
[24:52.360 --> 24:56.060]  And you went through and we made fun of you for liking telescopes or something like the
[24:56.060 --> 24:56.340]  catalog.
[24:56.820 --> 24:57.180]  Yeah.
[24:57.520 --> 25:00.880]  If you look at something in a microscope, do you freak out when you back out?
[25:00.880 --> 25:01.680]  Oh, yeah.
[25:01.720 --> 25:03.460]  I can go too deep on a microscope, too.
[25:03.960 --> 25:04.880]  And that bothers you.
[25:05.260 --> 25:05.420]  Yeah.
[25:05.780 --> 25:06.680]  It's something about.
[25:06.900 --> 25:08.200]  Yeah, it's just something about the zoom.
[25:08.240 --> 25:09.100]  I think zooming.
[25:09.360 --> 25:10.500]  Have you ever seen those?
[25:10.940 --> 25:12.360]  The Mandelbrot set?
[25:12.480 --> 25:14.720]  It's like a weird, like mathematical pattern.
[25:14.820 --> 25:16.240]  And it is like infinitely zooms.
[25:16.480 --> 25:18.280]  It honestly makes me want to throw up.
[25:19.560 --> 25:22.200]  Like those videos, like those illusion videos.
[25:22.380 --> 25:23.640]  What are you talking about?
[25:23.880 --> 25:25.620]  No, it's nerd shit.
[25:29.060 --> 25:30.580]  I was trying to relate.
[25:30.580 --> 25:35.060]  I've seen those like weird art type videos where it's constantly gives you the effect
[25:35.060 --> 25:36.620]  of zooming and it loops.
[25:37.060 --> 25:37.840]  Don't do that.
[25:37.900 --> 25:39.560]  I would kill him if you watch that.
[25:41.440 --> 25:44.600]  Can you imagine that'd be the worst thing ever for you, Gavin, if you were stuck in
[25:44.600 --> 25:47.300]  a constant zoom out and you could never escape?
[25:47.480 --> 25:48.880]  You just kept zooming out forever.
[25:49.040 --> 25:49.920]  Well, yeah, that's that's OK.
[25:49.980 --> 25:50.760]  So that's what this is.
[25:51.140 --> 25:51.780]  Don't look at it.
[25:52.160 --> 25:54.040]  Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
[25:54.280 --> 25:58.640]  I start to think like, OK, well, I start to try and track where I am as it zooms in.
[25:58.640 --> 26:00.640]  It went in and then it zoomed up to the right.
[26:00.940 --> 26:04.280]  And then it just gets to be too much information where I'm just like, man, if I lost something
[26:04.280 --> 26:05.640]  here, I would never find it again.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  And that idea freaks me out.
[26:07.060 --> 26:10.980]  If anyone wants to watch this, it's called the hardest trip.
[26:12.540 --> 26:13.280]  Fractal zoom.
[26:13.700 --> 26:19.800]  And it's just sort of what like visually it's sort of what it's like to be on mushrooms.
[26:21.340 --> 26:23.220]  I really appreciate Gavin's.
[26:23.280 --> 26:26.260]  It just keeps going like that should be on the front of the box.
[26:26.260 --> 26:31.860]  I like skipping through the video and seeing where it is and going wonder how it got there.
[26:31.960 --> 26:32.600]  It's pretty exciting.
[26:34.780 --> 26:40.480]  OK, so don't never have you zoom in or zoom out anything that makes you realize things
[26:40.480 --> 26:42.440]  are a lot vaster or smaller.
[26:42.600 --> 26:43.280]  You do not like.
[26:44.800 --> 26:47.160]  Yeah, I want to just be my size.
[26:52.880 --> 26:56.800]  Is there any aspect about your current size that you wish was smaller?
[26:59.100 --> 27:00.240]  I've been thinking about this.
[27:00.240 --> 27:01.740]  I wish I had smaller feet.
[27:02.340 --> 27:05.220]  I see only positives to having tiny feet.
[27:05.660 --> 27:07.360]  Nobody's asking you to pick nose.
[27:07.520 --> 27:09.700]  Yeah, your nose is a defining feature on you.
[27:09.740 --> 27:10.160]  It's lovely.
[27:11.720 --> 27:13.140]  Yeah, that was not a setup.
[27:13.260 --> 27:13.700]  I'm just curious.
[27:13.880 --> 27:17.020]  I've been genuinely thinking about, man, life would be better with small feet.
[27:17.440 --> 27:19.480]  I wish I do like trip over your feet because they're too big.
[27:19.920 --> 27:25.360]  No, I was looking at I have 11 size 11 feet, which are not like massive.
[27:25.600 --> 27:28.660]  But the issue is when you when there's like a cool sneaker,
[27:28.660 --> 27:31.700]  it's always sold out and like the common sizes.
[27:31.920 --> 27:38.180]  But then there's a million that are in like the size six, seven, eight kind of range.
[27:39.100 --> 27:42.420]  And I just don't see a disadvantage to having small feet.
[27:43.220 --> 27:47.100]  It is that you have like the most common shoe size and it's the fucking worst.
[27:47.180 --> 27:48.160]  I wear a ten and a half.
[27:48.240 --> 27:48.860]  Same kind of thing.
[27:49.220 --> 27:50.940]  A lot of places don't make half sizes anyway.
[27:51.160 --> 27:55.260]  And so it's just it's always a fucking cramming into a 10 or an 11 or getting
[27:55.260 --> 27:58.460]  lucky and finding a ten and a half when everybody else is looking for a ten and a half.
[27:58.460 --> 28:00.500]  Dude, it does.
[28:00.800 --> 28:03.920]  And I just don't feel like there's a small foot insecurity.
[28:04.140 --> 28:05.220]  Like, I don't think anyone cares.
[28:05.700 --> 28:07.160]  I only see it as a positive.
[28:07.440 --> 28:08.780]  Nobody's like, look at that guy's feet.
[28:08.860 --> 28:10.060]  They're fucking tiny.
[28:10.320 --> 28:11.100]  How embarrassing.
[28:11.760 --> 28:13.300]  Yeah, I mean, what are you, a size eight?
[28:13.520 --> 28:17.880]  You unless you're at like Disney and you're wearing sandals and well,
[28:17.900 --> 28:19.440]  then you go like, well, look at those feet.
[28:19.480 --> 28:20.180]  They don't look human.
[28:20.600 --> 28:21.760]  That's yeah, that's true.
[28:21.980 --> 28:22.600]  That's different.
[28:23.000 --> 28:23.940]  It wasn't the size.
[28:24.060 --> 28:27.440]  I'm not I'm not saying like a baby foot, just a small, a tiny foot.
[28:27.440 --> 28:28.740]  Like I got tiny hands.
[28:28.840 --> 28:34.520]  I wish my hands, if I could swap and have larger hands and tinier feet.
[28:34.640 --> 28:35.500]  That's the dream body.
[28:35.840 --> 28:37.020]  That's the adjustment I need.
[28:38.120 --> 28:38.600]  So.
[28:39.840 --> 28:40.840]  Wait, what is that?
[28:41.200 --> 28:46.580]  Larger hands and I'm saying that's the dream body.
[28:46.880 --> 28:51.920]  I'm saying for me, if we were optimizing my body, if you could,
[28:52.040 --> 28:56.540]  because I have tiny hands, but I have average to slightly big feet.
[28:56.540 --> 29:02.860]  If I could swap my feet and make my hands be average to slightly big
[29:02.860 --> 29:06.580]  and my feet be tiny, that's me in my optimal form.
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.620]  Do you want to be able to hold your own foot in the palm of your hand?
[29:09.700 --> 29:11.180]  Like when you touch a baby's foot?
[29:12.820 --> 29:13.580]  I don't.
[29:14.040 --> 29:16.320]  Well, with your big, big hands, you might be able to, you know.
[29:16.920 --> 29:19.500]  But I don't want freakishly large hands.
[29:19.560 --> 29:21.600]  I just want big hands.
[29:21.780 --> 29:25.220]  But you're happy with your extra long back and the size of your head.
[29:25.220 --> 29:29.680]  Yeah, that's just more stuff added to like the description to draw.
[29:29.740 --> 29:32.480]  Andrew is just like big feet, small hands.
[29:32.540 --> 29:35.060]  But then when you draw dream, Andrew, everything's the same.
[29:35.180 --> 29:37.080]  But it's big hands, small feet.
[29:37.320 --> 29:40.500]  So are you like Uncle Jack and it's always sunny with your hands?
[29:41.140 --> 29:43.480]  I don't remember Uncle Jack's hands.
[29:43.620 --> 29:46.680]  He was the lawyer who had tiny hands and he was always trying to hide his hands.
[29:47.160 --> 29:49.520]  Yeah, I'm not trying to hide them, but I have small hands.
[29:49.580 --> 29:50.080]  The ex-president.
[29:50.580 --> 29:50.780]  Yeah.
[29:51.060 --> 29:51.440]  Interesting.
[29:51.540 --> 29:54.160]  Once again, though, he pretends they're huge or whatever, right?
[29:54.160 --> 29:56.040]  I got to say, I've seen your hands.
[29:56.220 --> 29:59.920]  I feel like a lot over the course of knowing you and they seem totally fine to me.
[29:59.980 --> 30:00.660]  They're just small.
[30:00.840 --> 30:03.640]  I feel like Geoff has strong opinions on people's hands.
[30:04.120 --> 30:05.620]  He's like a real hand noticer.
[30:06.500 --> 30:08.600]  I don't notice anyone's hands ever.
[30:08.800 --> 30:10.120]  Is that something you lock in on, Geoff?
[30:10.600 --> 30:13.420]  I didn't realize it until this moment, but maybe Gavin's right.
[30:13.540 --> 30:14.660]  I had never considered it.
[30:15.040 --> 30:17.620]  I've just been around you where you comment on other people's hands.
[30:18.520 --> 30:20.400]  I don't. Yeah, I could see that.
[30:20.440 --> 30:21.620]  I'm pretty judgmental in general.
[30:26.840 --> 30:27.880]  Oh, man.
[30:30.160 --> 30:33.340]  Did anybody have anything they wanted to talk about this week other than hands and feet?
[30:33.940 --> 30:38.100]  I have to talk about that video you sent of Eric dancing.
[30:43.090 --> 30:45.050]  I've watched it 10 times.
[30:45.330 --> 30:45.990]  It's phenomenal.
[30:46.710 --> 30:47.210]  It's amazing.
[30:47.410 --> 30:51.290]  I think it's the contrast because you've got like Alyssa on the side.
[30:51.390 --> 30:53.810]  She's just cutting some shapes, looking good.
[30:53.810 --> 30:59.930]  You got Eric's small wife who's just moving majestically like she's a genie coming out
[30:59.930 --> 31:00.590]  the end of a lamp.
[31:00.790 --> 31:05.150]  And then you've got Eric who seems to rotate between every type of puppet.
[31:05.710 --> 31:10.010]  Like he goes from like marionette and then suddenly he's got like rods coming from below.
[31:10.090 --> 31:17.090]  It's like absolutely the weirdest contrast of different dances.
[31:17.110 --> 31:20.050]  He's like Jim Carrey in Fun with Nick and Jane.
[31:20.410 --> 31:21.650]  He's like, I'm a real boy.
[31:24.710 --> 31:26.350]  I can't get over it.
[31:26.790 --> 31:29.950]  When that video got sent to me, I watched it 20 times probably.
[31:30.930 --> 31:31.890]  Who took it?
[31:32.670 --> 31:33.230]  I don't know.
[31:33.750 --> 31:34.630]  I honestly don't know.
[31:34.730 --> 31:35.030]  Really?
[31:35.530 --> 31:36.510]  I assumed you did.
[31:37.030 --> 31:37.770]  No, no.
[31:39.290 --> 31:46.350]  I gave you the only note or media I took at the wedding, which was that Nick really likes to dance.
[31:46.430 --> 31:47.050]  Oh, yeah.
[31:47.890 --> 31:49.390]  I didn't find out about that.
[31:49.630 --> 31:52.990]  I didn't know that Eric danced at the wedding until like three or four days later when the
[31:52.990 --> 31:54.310]  video, when I got sent the video.
[31:54.650 --> 31:56.050]  I didn't dance very much at the wedding.
[31:56.190 --> 32:01.110]  I'm very specific about what I want to move to, especially in a venue like a wedding where
[32:01.110 --> 32:02.370]  I couldn't get drunk.
[32:02.910 --> 32:04.550]  Yeah, I'm sorry about that, by the way.
[32:04.630 --> 32:05.910]  No, no, not your fault.
[32:06.550 --> 32:06.950]  Absolutely.
[32:07.250 --> 32:10.410]  But Nina Sky, Move Your Body, great song.
[32:10.610 --> 32:12.110]  Great song to dance to.
[32:12.150 --> 32:14.130]  And I'd say, for not being drunk, phenomenal effort.
[32:14.610 --> 32:18.890]  Oh, that's sometimes you just gotta, you gotta, you get out there and you give 110%.
[32:19.470 --> 32:19.690]  Yep.
[32:19.690 --> 32:24.070]  And then that end, like that ends and it starts like, I think it started and they were playing
[32:24.070 --> 32:25.850]  like Kiss by Prince.
[32:25.930 --> 32:27.670]  And I went, fucking great song.
[32:27.790 --> 32:28.650]  And it got me out there.
[32:28.930 --> 32:30.250]  And then they played that and I went, awesome.
[32:30.490 --> 32:31.330]  And then they played something else.
[32:31.350 --> 32:32.910]  And I went, and that's enough for me.
[32:34.650 --> 32:35.590]  I'm just particular.
[32:37.050 --> 32:38.290]  Well, I'm just, I agree.
[32:38.370 --> 32:39.990]  You were giving it 110% for sure.
[32:40.010 --> 32:41.530]  I thought it was, I thought it was fantastic.
[32:41.590 --> 32:42.330]  It was great moves.
[32:42.630 --> 32:43.630]  That's why I wanted to share it.
[32:43.670 --> 32:46.270]  I didn't know that Eric was so talented on the dance floor.
[32:46.270 --> 32:47.110]  Oh, thank you.
[32:47.110 --> 32:50.050]  I've been to many weddings and have danced that way.
[32:50.750 --> 32:52.050]  Many, many, many times.
[32:52.510 --> 32:52.850]  It shows.
[32:53.410 --> 32:54.130]  Oh, thank you.
[32:54.610 --> 32:55.530]  Thank you very much.
[32:55.830 --> 32:56.090]  Practiced.
[32:56.250 --> 32:56.350]  Yeah.
[32:56.410 --> 32:56.570]  Yeah.
[32:56.690 --> 32:59.030]  It's, uh, you know, you just got, you feel the rhythm.
[32:59.390 --> 32:59.870]  Move your body.
[32:59.970 --> 33:00.350]  Great song.
[33:00.570 --> 33:03.750]  It's just sometimes you get out there and it's exactly what you want to hear.
[33:04.270 --> 33:06.610]  You're letting the song do all the work, honestly.
[33:06.770 --> 33:07.470]  Yeah, absolutely.
[33:07.690 --> 33:09.910]  I'm just moving my body like it says, move your body.
[33:10.310 --> 33:10.490]  Yeah.
[33:11.250 --> 33:13.010]  So those are simply instructions.
[33:17.810 --> 33:20.210]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[33:20.750 --> 33:21.910]  We're in the holiday season.
[33:22.150 --> 33:23.290]  It's a stressful time.
[33:23.450 --> 33:27.310]  You got to get gifts for people to be a lot of, maybe you don't, you know, like different
[33:27.310 --> 33:31.150]  families and different friend groups have different procedures, but it's still just
[33:31.150 --> 33:37.810]  a time in which I personally feel both incredibly excited as well as very, very stressed.
[33:38.230 --> 33:41.850]  And whether or not your family gives gifts during the holidays, you get to define how
[33:41.850 --> 33:42.910]  you give to yourself.
[33:43.470 --> 33:45.150]  And the holidays are a great time to do that.
[33:45.150 --> 33:49.110]  So whether it's by starting therapy, going easy on yourself during the tough moments
[33:49.110 --> 33:53.270]  or treating yourself to a day of complete rest, remember to give yourself some love
[33:53.270 --> 33:55.350]  this holiday season, which is so important.
[33:55.810 --> 33:56.410]  All seasons.
[33:57.310 --> 34:02.450]  Something that I have struggled with in the past is loving who I am and embracing myself
[34:02.450 --> 34:08.730]  and understanding, not just understanding, but feeling, I guess, is the difficult part
[34:08.730 --> 34:14.970]  that I've had of logically knowing that I deserve to take care of myself and love the
[34:14.970 --> 34:15.850]  person that I am.
[34:16.550 --> 34:22.230]  But to fully embrace that is something that I struggled with for a long time, that therapy
[34:22.230 --> 34:23.770]  really helped me with.
[34:25.310 --> 34:27.690]  Therapy has helped me in so many ways, as I talk about every time.
[34:27.950 --> 34:29.250]  I couldn't recommend it enough.
[34:30.030 --> 34:32.630]  I think it's a really important process to go through.
[34:32.870 --> 34:38.830]  And I gained so many positive things that I would have never discovered or learned about
[34:38.830 --> 34:40.530]  myself without going through that process.
[34:40.930 --> 34:43.950]  So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.

[36:34.130 --> 36:34.950]  Let's get nuts!
[36:35.210 --> 36:36.230]  At Nuts.com.

[36:39.590 --> 36:40.670]  Do you like musicals?
[36:40.670 --> 36:42.490]  Because it's a musical, but they're not going to tell...
[36:42.490 --> 36:43.670]  Anyway, that doesn't matter.
[36:44.030 --> 36:45.050]  Who cares about Willy Wonka?
[36:45.250 --> 36:51.570]  I'm here to tell you about Nuts.com and that the modern real version of that is Nuts.com.
[36:52.030 --> 36:54.670]  Because in addition to an amazing selection of nuts,
[36:54.910 --> 36:59.490]  they have tons of classic candies like butterscotch, fudge, and licorice.

[37:21.170 --> 37:23.870]  Now, you probably know that I'm a massive snacks guy.
[37:23.970 --> 37:25.210]  I love all types of snacks.
[37:25.310 --> 37:26.690]  Sweet, salty, I don't care.
[37:27.110 --> 37:28.310]  I'm all about it.
[37:28.310 --> 37:35.370]  And there is nothing greater than I could say than I devour bags of Nuts.com,
[37:35.430 --> 37:37.430]  especially their chocolate gummy bears.
[37:37.690 --> 37:38.390]  So good.

[38:15.530 --> 38:19.510]  Hey, can I tell you guys about the thing that happened to me at my honeymoon?
[38:19.850 --> 38:20.510]  Of course.
[38:20.830 --> 38:23.330]  Yeah, I wanted to tell last week, but we ran out of time.
[38:23.330 --> 38:26.190]  And I'm scared I'll forget how to tell it if I don't tell it soon.
[38:27.070 --> 38:28.770]  Because it wasn't that big of a deal.
[38:28.870 --> 38:33.090]  But it's pretty... I think most people would be embarrassed.
[38:33.250 --> 38:35.690]  Not I, but maybe most people would.
[38:36.270 --> 38:39.550]  So for the honeymoon, Emily and I went to one of the...
[38:39.550 --> 38:41.690]  like an all-inclusive resort in Cancun.
[38:41.770 --> 38:43.510]  Very similar, Eric, to where we went together.
[38:44.070 --> 38:47.410]  Just on the other side, like in Playa Mujeres.
[38:47.710 --> 38:48.350]  Ooh, nice.
[38:48.390 --> 38:49.570]  Just a little further down the road.
[38:50.130 --> 38:53.850]  And first off, I wanted to say, I think I sent you guys pictures,
[38:54.090 --> 38:55.530]  but it was protected by falcons.
[38:55.690 --> 38:56.790]  There was a falcon on site.
[38:58.130 --> 38:59.890]  So we felt extremely safe.
[38:59.990 --> 39:07.490]  Although Emily made... I swear to gods, on day one, Emily saw a lizard and went...
[39:08.750 --> 39:11.670]  like one of those big salamanders, or like one of those big lizards.
[39:11.790 --> 39:14.690]  And she goes... she just made eye contact.
[39:14.850 --> 39:15.710]  Iguana, thank you, Chrissy.
[39:15.910 --> 39:18.150]  She saw an iguana, and she just made eye contact with it.
[39:18.170 --> 39:19.470]  And she was like, oh, that's so cute.
[39:19.990 --> 39:24.170]  And from that moment on, like iguanas talk, I guess.
[39:24.730 --> 39:28.510]  And they just like... everywhere we went, there were five iguanas staring,
[39:28.730 --> 39:30.090]  making eye contact at Emily.
[39:30.310 --> 39:34.110]  Like they were either like enraptured by her, or they hated her.
[39:34.210 --> 39:35.170]  I couldn't figure it out.
[39:35.450 --> 39:37.230]  But we couldn't get away from them.
[39:37.490 --> 39:41.130]  To the point where I think we sent you guys a video where one of the iguanas like
[39:41.130 --> 39:43.910]  jumped up into her lap to try to get her food.
[39:44.490 --> 39:45.750]  Yeah, like she was fucking terrified.
[39:45.910 --> 39:48.430]  And every time we turned around, there was an iguana within a foot of her.
[39:48.430 --> 39:50.970]  One of them, we were laying down in a bed by the beach,
[39:51.090 --> 39:54.210]  and one of them just hopped up on the bed next to her and just walked right up to her
[39:54.210 --> 39:56.450]  and started eating her sandwich in front of her.
[39:56.650 --> 39:59.010]  Like as if to say, fuck you, what are you going to do about it?
[39:59.030 --> 40:00.770]  And we were just like, yeah, I got the fuck out of there.
[40:00.910 --> 40:02.470]  Like it won the sandwich.
[40:02.590 --> 40:03.370]  It was actually a quesadilla.
[40:03.530 --> 40:04.930]  It ate the whole fucking quesadilla.
[40:05.050 --> 40:05.590]  It was insane.
[40:07.370 --> 40:08.290]  And they're big.
[40:08.390 --> 40:09.110]  They are. They're big.
[40:09.410 --> 40:11.790]  Anyway, we got to this all inclusive.
[40:11.930 --> 40:13.130]  It was like a little different.
[40:14.130 --> 40:16.390]  And by different, it was supposed to be like more romantic.
[40:16.390 --> 40:18.970]  But I think that really just meant it was a little more expensive
[40:19.450 --> 40:21.530]  and had somehow less options.
[40:21.770 --> 40:23.110]  Eric, like there was no fucking...
[40:23.110 --> 40:26.250]  I would say maybe the best thing at the one we went to was the buffet.
[40:26.650 --> 40:27.170]  Oh, yeah.
[40:27.790 --> 40:29.030]  There's no buffet at this one.
[40:29.610 --> 40:30.530]  Oh, so like...
[40:30.530 --> 40:30.910]  Why?
[40:31.130 --> 40:31.370]  What?
[40:31.710 --> 40:32.050]  Right.
[40:32.250 --> 40:34.190]  And so you got to like go to dinner and you're like,
[40:34.270 --> 40:36.310]  you have to pick one of the fucking theme restaurants.
[40:36.450 --> 40:37.770]  You're like, I guess we're eating French tonight.
[40:38.110 --> 40:42.630]  But how are you supposed to eat like pizza and stars?
[40:43.090 --> 40:43.430]  Exactly.
[40:43.550 --> 40:44.010]  You can't.
[40:44.050 --> 40:46.130]  There's a pizza restaurant you can go eat pizza at.
[40:46.390 --> 40:47.550]  Did they have stars?
[40:47.910 --> 40:49.770]  No, there was no stars to be found, unfortunately.
[40:50.510 --> 40:53.530]  The candy selection was real dog shit, if I'm being honest with you.
[40:54.030 --> 40:56.070]  But anyway, I wanted to do...
[40:56.070 --> 40:59.350]  I wanted to have like the most relaxing vacation ever.
[40:59.430 --> 41:00.810]  We were only there for like four or five days.
[41:01.390 --> 41:04.310]  And we relaxed hard when we went together, Eric.
[41:04.610 --> 41:06.010]  But I wanted to beat that.
[41:06.090 --> 41:07.770]  I wanted to be even more relaxing than that.
[41:07.950 --> 41:09.530]  I wanted to do even less than we did.
[41:09.650 --> 41:11.310]  And so I think we set out to do that.
[41:11.390 --> 41:13.090]  We would... and I felt pretty good about it.
[41:13.090 --> 41:15.130]  We did two days that were just spa days.
[41:15.470 --> 41:18.090]  And so the first spa day, we go there.
[41:18.670 --> 41:21.390]  And I emailed ahead because all that shit books up.
[41:21.450 --> 41:23.690]  And I just said, hey, my my fiance and I are getting married.
[41:23.810 --> 41:24.570]  It's going to be our honeymoon.
[41:25.190 --> 41:27.330]  Can you just pamper us for two days?
[41:28.770 --> 41:31.730]  And I don't know what... I don't understand what any of this shit is.
[41:31.970 --> 41:34.010]  So could you just give us like the honeymoon package or whatever?
[41:34.050 --> 41:35.110]  And they're like, we'll take care of you.
[41:35.310 --> 41:37.610]  So I get an email the night before and they just go,
[41:37.710 --> 41:40.990]  just show up at the sauna or at the spa tomorrow in swim trunks.
[41:41.090 --> 41:41.550]  That's all you need.
[41:41.910 --> 41:42.490]  I'm like, okay.
[41:42.950 --> 41:44.150]  So I just showed up in swim trunks.
[41:44.150 --> 41:45.330]  And Emily showed up in a bathing suit.
[41:45.450 --> 41:49.450]  And then we did like an hour long hydrotherapy thing where they make you get in hot water
[41:49.450 --> 41:53.690]  and then cold water and then a sauna and then a steam room and the whole thing.
[41:53.810 --> 41:53.910]  Right.
[41:54.430 --> 41:57.250]  And when we came out, they go, okay, now you're ready for your next thing.
[41:57.350 --> 42:00.330]  You're going to get a full body like sugar scrub.
[42:00.410 --> 42:01.790]  We're going to scrub your whole body down.
[42:02.170 --> 42:03.370]  And we're like, oh, cool.
[42:03.390 --> 42:04.710]  That sounds fun, I guess.
[42:04.890 --> 42:12.930]  And the lady hands me what I can only describe as a Speedo diaper.
[42:13.690 --> 42:15.750]  Like if a Speedo was a diaper.
[42:16.130 --> 42:19.310]  It's the same color as like a hospital gown, you know?
[42:19.930 --> 42:23.290]  And it's like elastic, but it's the size of a Speedo.
[42:24.210 --> 42:27.230]  But it looks like a poofy little diaper.
[42:27.390 --> 42:31.310]  And she goes, uh, she's like talking to Emily and telling Emily where to go.
[42:31.470 --> 42:33.850]  And then she tells me, she's like, just put this on and then meet us out here.
[42:33.950 --> 42:34.450]  And I go, okay.
[42:34.650 --> 42:36.470]  And I, she must have said some other stuff.
[42:36.530 --> 42:37.230]  I didn't hear her.
[42:37.950 --> 42:41.290]  But I'd also been blasted in the head with water jets for like the last hour.
[42:41.390 --> 42:42.510]  So I might not have been able to hear too good.
[42:43.070 --> 42:47.970]  And so she's like, you know, just go back into your fucking locker room and put this on.
[42:48.030 --> 42:48.730]  And I go, okay.
[42:49.270 --> 42:51.850]  And when I went in there initially, because I only brought swim trunks,
[42:51.990 --> 42:53.790]  they were like, just go, here's your locker number.
[42:53.970 --> 42:55.430]  Just go put your stuff in that locker and lock it.
[42:55.470 --> 42:57.170]  So I go and throw my phone and stuff in there and lock it.
[42:57.450 --> 43:00.370]  And then there's like, I didn't think about it, but there was like some, uh,
[43:00.750 --> 43:03.470]  there was some rubber shoes and a rope, right?
[43:03.810 --> 43:09.470]  And so I put, I take my clothes off, my swim trunks off, and I put the diaper on.
[43:10.110 --> 43:14.770]  And it looks like if ZZ Top wore a COVID mask.
[43:16.070 --> 43:18.370]  It's like pubic hair everywhere.
[43:19.070 --> 43:23.230]  My balls are so much bigger than this thing can accommodate.
[43:23.650 --> 43:28.250]  And so I got like a ball hanging out the left or a ball hanging out the right,
[43:28.310 --> 43:30.470]  but there's no way to keep both balls contained.
[43:30.710 --> 43:32.170]  You couldn't stack them?
[43:32.550 --> 43:36.270]  No, dude, it's not. I'm telling you, it's not, there's not room.
[43:37.130 --> 43:39.430]  And, and it's also poofy in all the directions.
[43:39.610 --> 43:40.990]  And it's almost like a G string.
[43:41.510 --> 43:45.310]  You know that, that wooden toy that you can play with that, like the wooden balls
[43:45.310 --> 43:47.050]  where like one goes down, one goes up.
[43:47.110 --> 43:48.990]  Like, that's just what I'm imagining in my head.
[43:49.230 --> 43:50.490]  I wish those things were called.
[43:51.430 --> 43:55.190]  And so I'm looking in the mirror and I'm just dumped out of this thing.
[43:55.270 --> 43:58.330]  And they're like, you can see like 80% of my dick and my ball,
[43:58.430 --> 44:00.350]  like most of both of my balls, honestly.
[44:00.630 --> 44:02.070]  And there's just like pubic hair everywhere.
[44:02.430 --> 44:05.130]  And I look at myself in the mirror and I'm like,
[44:05.490 --> 44:07.490]  I mean, I, we're at a spa, right?
[44:07.550 --> 44:12.130]  She wouldn't have told me to put it on if she didn't want me to wear it.
[44:13.270 --> 44:14.150]  So, fuck it.
[44:14.390 --> 44:15.190]  When in Rome, right?
[44:15.250 --> 44:17.750]  So I walk outside and outside is into the sauna.
[44:18.310 --> 44:19.330]  And I don't know where to go.
[44:19.470 --> 44:20.290]  Emily's still inside.
[44:20.490 --> 44:22.970]  So I just sit like in a chair with my fucking legs open.
[44:23.690 --> 44:26.730]  Uh, just like, I guess showing the world everything.
[44:26.730 --> 44:27.550]  Cause like, fuck it.
[44:27.910 --> 44:30.650]  That's, that's, I'm doing what she told me to do, right?
[44:30.710 --> 44:31.910]  I'm trying to fit in there.
[44:31.910 --> 44:35.590]  But then I start to notice like all the married couples and the old ladies
[44:35.590 --> 44:38.030]  and all the people around me are starting to look pretty fucking horrified.
[44:38.990 --> 44:42.750]  And, uh, and, and, uh, like I'm getting a lot of dirty looks.
[44:42.850 --> 44:43.970]  And then I hear, sir?
[44:45.370 --> 44:45.690]  Sir?
[44:46.050 --> 44:49.010]  And I turn over and I see my lady running at me full speed.
[44:49.070 --> 44:52.910]  And she goes, she's going, sir, no, sir, no, no, sir.
[44:53.150 --> 44:53.770]  Sir, no.
[44:53.910 --> 44:55.710]  And she gets to me and she's out of breath by the time she gets to me.
[44:55.730 --> 44:56.430]  And I'm like, hey, what's up?
[44:56.670 --> 44:59.510]  And she's like, the robe, put your robe on.
[44:59.510 --> 45:02.790]  And I was like, oh, I guess I missed that part.
[45:03.050 --> 45:04.270]  And so I had to put my robe on.
[45:04.670 --> 45:06.550]  Uh, I guess I wasn't supposed to go out there in the diaper.
[45:06.770 --> 45:10.230]  And so I showed like 30 people my dick and my balls.
[45:14.610 --> 45:17.570]  And, uh, yeah.
[45:17.750 --> 45:18.330]  So that's my-
[45:18.330 --> 45:20.370]  You didn't just see a bunch of people in robes?
[45:22.570 --> 45:23.810]  I did. I didn't think about it.
[45:23.890 --> 45:24.630]  There were tons of people in robes.
[45:24.630 --> 45:25.750]  I don't know anyone else.
[45:25.890 --> 45:27.830]  I don't know anyone else this would have happened to.
[45:27.830 --> 45:31.330]  If I was unsure, I would have been peeking around every corner.
[45:31.470 --> 45:33.210]  I'd be just be trying to get a look of anyone.
[45:34.150 --> 45:34.750]  You gotta-
[45:34.750 --> 45:37.010]  You'd stroll out and spread legs.
[45:37.290 --> 45:38.630]  You gotta own it, dude.
[45:38.930 --> 45:39.630]  You gotta-
[45:39.630 --> 45:43.570]  I was following instructions.
[45:43.890 --> 45:47.730]  I didn't realize I missed some of the instructions and I stopped halfway along,
[45:47.890 --> 45:49.330]  but I was just following instructions.
[45:49.830 --> 45:52.210]  Anyway, uh, so that was real awkward.
[45:52.650 --> 45:56.630]  And, uh, Emily started laughing and I shit you not,
[45:56.630 --> 45:58.630]  she didn't stop laughing for 24 hours.
[45:59.410 --> 46:03.170]  Like, she laughed for 24 straight hours.
[46:03.790 --> 46:06.230]  Just any time it popped up, she just would lose it.
[46:06.330 --> 46:08.590]  And so I've never heard her laugh so much or so hard.
[46:09.090 --> 46:11.730]  Uh, it must have been hideous.
[46:11.810 --> 46:13.750]  I actually wanted to take a picture of the diaper.
[46:14.330 --> 46:18.370]  I was gonna take a picture the next day because we went back for another day of-
[46:18.370 --> 46:19.050]  another session.
[46:19.550 --> 46:22.170]  And, uh, they didn't give me the diaper this time and I was actually bummed
[46:22.170 --> 46:23.510]  because we did the same hydrotherapy thing.
[46:23.570 --> 46:24.750]  I didn't mean to double book it, but I did.
[46:24.750 --> 46:26.350]  But this time they were going to give us massages.
[46:27.350 --> 46:31.850]  And, uh, so after I took my swim trunks off, they took us to the massage room and
[46:31.850 --> 46:33.230]  they were like, all right, get under the covers.
[46:33.330 --> 46:33.650]  We'll leave.
[46:33.730 --> 46:37.870]  And I usually have like underwear on when I, uh-
[46:37.870 --> 46:40.150]  Oh yeah, Gracie's like, I wouldn't be able to show my face the second day.
[46:40.350 --> 46:41.530]  Yeah, no, I walked in proudly.
[46:43.310 --> 46:46.150]  Um, but so the next day I went and I learned something about myself.
[46:46.210 --> 46:50.590]  I've never had a completely naked, uh, massage before.
[46:50.810 --> 46:53.170]  And I don't like them at all.
[46:53.710 --> 46:59.290]  Every time the lady would massage my thigh, my asshole winked.
[46:59.710 --> 47:01.490]  And it was freaking me out.
[47:01.590 --> 47:04.470]  And I kept thinking, can this lady see that my butthole's winking at her?
[47:04.590 --> 47:06.030]  And why is it doing this?
[47:06.270 --> 47:08.830]  Why would it do this just because I'm not wearing underwear?
[47:09.050 --> 47:11.990]  Is she like touching something to my thigh that's making my butt wink?
[47:12.150 --> 47:13.330]  And it creeped me out.
[47:13.410 --> 47:16.850]  And so for like 30 minutes of an hour or a 90 minute massage, all I could think about
[47:16.850 --> 47:18.690]  is like, please stop winking my butthole lady.
[47:18.990 --> 47:19.110]  Please.
[47:19.170 --> 47:20.010]  It wasn't relaxing.
[47:20.490 --> 47:21.330]  I was just terrified.
[47:21.330 --> 47:25.110]  Was it just the tug was like pulling your butt cheek and just opening your hole?
[47:25.110 --> 47:26.910]  It was just like, just like rubbing my thigh.
[47:27.030 --> 47:30.670]  And then my butthole would just go like bloop and just open up and close and open up and close.
[47:30.990 --> 47:32.470]  Like it was yawning or winking.
[47:32.630 --> 47:35.430]  And I don't know why I thought like, is it because I'm not wearing underwear?
[47:35.590 --> 47:37.490]  Because I'm uncomfortable that I'm just hyper aware.
[47:37.590 --> 47:38.370]  Do I always do this?
[47:38.390 --> 47:39.090]  But I'm not wearing underwear.
[47:39.210 --> 47:39.890]  So it's hidden.
[47:40.010 --> 47:42.970]  So I don't think about it is does the lady know I'm winking at her?
[47:43.110 --> 47:44.610]  Does this happen to her all the time?
[47:44.950 --> 47:46.570]  Fucking took me out of the massage.
[47:46.650 --> 47:47.750]  I gotta be honest with you.
[47:48.250 --> 47:49.570]  So you had a relaxing time?
[47:50.830 --> 47:51.510]  Sort of.
[47:51.650 --> 47:53.090]  There was one other thing I realized.
[47:54.730 --> 47:56.350]  So before the wedding.
[47:57.310 --> 48:01.390]  I got a pedicure with some friends of mine that aren't you guys.
[48:01.870 --> 48:04.930]  And we went and well, I'm just saying like it just did.
[48:05.030 --> 48:09.350]  I don't think, you know, Eric, a different Eric or Jeremy.
[48:09.550 --> 48:10.570]  Do you know Eric and Jeremy?
[48:10.650 --> 48:12.510]  They're like, no, but they're Emily's friends.
[48:13.250 --> 48:18.090]  But if you said I got a pedicure with some friends, we know that we didn't get that pedicure.
[48:18.090 --> 48:21.230]  You didn't need to clarify to us that we weren't there.
[48:22.030 --> 48:23.270]  Yeah, well, you guys weren't there.
[48:23.370 --> 48:25.610]  Yeah, we had all the information and then you just rubbed it in.
[48:25.630 --> 48:26.410]  We were aware of that one.
[48:26.430 --> 48:27.410]  No, I wasn't trying to rub it in.
[48:27.430 --> 48:28.570]  I guess I was trying to make it clear to the audience.
[48:28.950 --> 48:31.690]  Anyway, I just got a pedicure with some friends that aren't you guys.
[48:33.130 --> 48:36.030]  And it definitely wasn't you guys.
[48:37.890 --> 48:38.830]  And it was nice.
[48:38.970 --> 48:41.510]  And I hadn't had a pedicure and I think I've had one in my life.
[48:41.530 --> 48:42.810]  So it was like kind of fun and relaxing.
[48:42.910 --> 48:43.690]  It was right before the wedding.
[48:44.130 --> 48:44.990]  Yeah, I mean, neither have we.
[48:44.990 --> 48:49.470]  And well, Eric, you were invited to the monthly pedicure party.
[48:49.590 --> 48:51.250]  We're going to start having and you accepted.
[48:51.650 --> 48:52.770]  OK, I accepted.
[48:53.030 --> 48:55.250]  But you're talking about one I didn't get to go to.
[48:55.590 --> 48:57.030]  But it's with these guys.
[48:57.110 --> 48:59.150]  This is going to be the same pedicure party we're going to go to.
[48:59.270 --> 49:01.290]  We're all going to be a part of your pedicure parties work.
[49:01.390 --> 49:02.250]  I have I've been invited.
[49:02.370 --> 49:05.050]  I haven't been issued like, oh, here's when will you invite it?
[49:07.350 --> 49:08.070]  Uh, yesterday.
[49:08.410 --> 49:08.710]  Talk to me.
[49:08.810 --> 49:10.030]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:10.130 --> 49:10.950]  Just, you know, hanging out.
[49:11.130 --> 49:14.250]  Yeah, yeah, we're hanging out and it's, you know, not a big deal.
[49:14.250 --> 49:15.270]  Yeah, it's not a big deal.
[49:15.910 --> 49:17.930]  I was hanging out yesterday with a friend that is Eric.
[49:18.750 --> 49:21.990]  And so anyway, so then I go.
[49:22.390 --> 49:26.770]  And one of the parts of the first spa day is another pedicure, which, by the way,
[49:26.890 --> 49:31.210]  you need a pedicure once every I mean, if you get a pedicure once every 10 years,
[49:31.210 --> 49:32.230]  I guess is where I'm at.
[49:32.890 --> 49:34.430]  Two and four days is a lot.
[49:35.030 --> 49:37.990]  And so I thought, like, this seems fucking excessive, but I paid for it.
[49:37.990 --> 49:38.410]  So whatever.
[49:38.490 --> 49:39.630]  And then so I get that pedicure.
[49:39.930 --> 49:42.950]  And then the next fucking day, when we go back to the spa,
[49:43.430 --> 49:45.930]  they give me a foot massage, which is cool.
[49:46.630 --> 49:52.850]  But then I got to thinking three complete strangers have been all over my feet in the last week.
[49:53.290 --> 49:56.410]  That's more people than have seen my feet in the last 10 years.
[49:56.510 --> 49:57.470]  That's just weird.
[49:57.950 --> 49:59.070]  Yeah, Gavin would have been in heaven.
[49:59.230 --> 50:01.830]  He would have been just like fucking you've just been cum spots everywhere.
[50:02.330 --> 50:06.170]  But it was like I just I got to kind of grossed out about it when I thought about it.
[50:06.190 --> 50:11.570]  Like, uh, I don't like it kind of creeped me out that all these people had touched my feet
[50:11.570 --> 50:13.630]  and my feet felt dirty and I felt like I had to wash them.
[50:13.990 --> 50:18.230]  And then I was like, kind of happy to be leaving the honeymoon and to go home because I was like,
[50:18.270 --> 50:20.130]  I'm done with the foot stuff, at least like that.
[50:20.270 --> 50:21.090]  That was a bit much.
[50:21.330 --> 50:22.530]  Go through fucking security.
[50:22.830 --> 50:24.490]  And Emily checked a bag.
[50:25.270 --> 50:28.330]  She's getting really into checking bags lately, which I'm not on board with.
[50:29.030 --> 50:30.150]  But so what are you going to do?
[50:30.190 --> 50:31.930]  We're married now, you know, there's nothing I can do about it.
[50:32.950 --> 50:34.590]  And so she checked a bag.
[50:34.670 --> 50:39.810]  And so I had no bags in the airport, which Emily and Vanessa and Bernie,
[50:39.810 --> 50:41.930]  every time they see me in the airport with no bags, the second time I've done that,
[50:42.090 --> 50:45.690]  they say they tell me I look like a terrorist and they don't want to stand next to me.
[50:46.010 --> 50:48.190]  But if you, they're right.
[50:48.250 --> 50:51.110]  If you look around, everybody's got a bag but me and I definitely stand out.
[50:51.490 --> 50:52.990]  Uh, anyways, she's brushing shit.
[50:53.910 --> 50:54.830]  In the checked bag.
[50:54.910 --> 50:56.030]  Just throw it all in Emily's bag.
[50:57.310 --> 50:59.030]  She's already checking a bag and it's big.
[50:59.110 --> 50:59.730]  So just fuck it.
[51:00.370 --> 51:01.410]  Have you never done that before?
[51:02.550 --> 51:05.210]  Like checked everything and just walked on with like nothing?
[51:05.730 --> 51:07.510]  I've walked on a plane with nothing.
[51:07.630 --> 51:08.490]  I don't like nothing.
[51:08.630 --> 51:09.510]  Just not brought anything.
[51:09.510 --> 51:13.870]  I did it one time and I was told that it is it's psycho behavior.
[51:14.230 --> 51:14.270]  Yeah.
[51:14.350 --> 51:17.370]  And that I looked like a serial killer walking on with nothing.
[51:17.690 --> 51:22.010]  And I feel like every time I travel, I bring like nine lithium batteries with me.
[51:22.070 --> 51:22.990]  So that's all going to come.
[51:23.830 --> 51:24.690]  They can't be checked, right?
[51:24.710 --> 51:27.410]  Like my laptop, my switch, my steam deck.
[51:27.450 --> 51:27.950]  Got my goodies.
[51:28.490 --> 51:29.310]  You got to bring your goodies.
[51:31.270 --> 51:37.350]  So I, we go through security and they like, you know how they check your passport when
[51:37.350 --> 51:40.870]  you're getting on a plane in a foreign country before you had to go through that little area.
[51:41.270 --> 51:43.650]  And so they check my passport and it dings up and they go,
[51:43.730 --> 51:45.810]  sir, you've been selected for secondary screening.
[51:45.950 --> 51:47.370]  And I go, awesome.
[51:48.590 --> 51:48.870]  Awesome.
[51:49.050 --> 51:50.210]  I'm all about it.
[51:50.270 --> 51:51.830]  She's like, grab your bags and come over here.
[51:51.830 --> 51:52.830]  And I'm like, got them.
[51:53.230 --> 51:54.010]  And I walk over.
[51:54.090 --> 51:55.070]  She's like, where's your bags?
[51:55.110 --> 51:56.170]  And I go, I don't have any bags.
[51:56.450 --> 51:57.830]  This is going to be a real easy search for you.
[51:57.850 --> 52:00.930]  And she looks at me and she just gives this like really annoyed face.
[52:00.930 --> 52:01.930]  And she's like, empty your pockets.
[52:01.990 --> 52:02.690]  And I'm like, they're empty.
[52:02.810 --> 52:03.850]  But here's my wallet.
[52:03.930 --> 52:04.310]  Here's my phone.
[52:04.350 --> 52:04.590]  That's it.
[52:04.610 --> 52:05.330]  That's all I got, you know?
[52:05.650 --> 52:06.910]  And she pats me down.
[52:06.910 --> 52:08.490]  And I'm like, okay.
[52:08.810 --> 52:10.690]  And she goes, sir, take your shoes off.
[52:11.010 --> 52:14.050]  And I go, okay, I guess.
[52:14.530 --> 52:17.650]  And so she makes me sit down and she watches me take my shoes off.
[52:17.690 --> 52:18.910]  And then she's like, give me your feet.
[52:19.370 --> 52:24.550]  And then she fucking touched my socked feet to make sure I didn't have, I don't know,
[52:24.650 --> 52:26.470]  knives or guns in my fucking feet.
[52:27.130 --> 52:30.610]  And I realized those motherfuckers got me one last time.
[52:30.790 --> 52:33.550]  My feet got molested one last time.
[52:34.530 --> 52:36.050]  Can I pass over the title then?
[52:36.910 --> 52:37.330]  Yeah.
[52:37.390 --> 52:38.230]  You're the foot guy.
[52:38.910 --> 52:39.870]  Oh, wow.
[52:40.170 --> 52:41.870]  I hadn't even considered that.
[52:42.690 --> 52:44.430]  Geoff, you might be the foot guy.
[52:44.590 --> 52:45.910]  I'm a reluctant foot guy.
[52:46.250 --> 52:50.250]  It's like how Gavin says, I don't want girls to put their finger on my butt.
[52:50.350 --> 52:51.490]  They just do it all the time.
[52:51.630 --> 52:54.190]  I don't want anybody to touch my fucking feet.
[52:54.270 --> 52:55.350]  They just keep doing it.
[52:56.490 --> 52:57.450]  Sorry, Gracie.
[52:59.070 --> 53:00.410]  That's 10 years old.
[53:00.490 --> 53:01.410]  Everybody knows that.
[53:01.690 --> 53:03.090]  That's old Achievement Hunter shit.
[53:03.270 --> 53:04.850]  Everybody knows that.
[53:06.310 --> 53:07.990]  I just had a bit of a run.
[53:10.990 --> 53:13.110]  A run is one way to describe it.
[53:13.250 --> 53:14.070]  Oh, my God.
[53:14.770 --> 53:17.290]  I had nothing to do with it, really.
[53:18.090 --> 53:20.130]  It sounds like you were a main player in it.
[53:22.190 --> 53:25.150]  Have you guys seen that TikTok going around about
[53:25.150 --> 53:28.610]  supposedly Michael Jackson has a different voice in private?
[53:29.010 --> 53:30.030]  Or had a different voice in private?
[53:30.410 --> 53:30.630]  Yeah.
[53:31.810 --> 53:33.050]  Do you think it's real?
[53:33.730 --> 53:33.890]  Yeah.
[53:33.930 --> 53:34.290]  Oh, yeah.
[53:35.050 --> 53:35.650]  That's crazy.
[53:35.790 --> 53:36.070]  There's no way.
[53:36.070 --> 53:37.630]  He didn't sound like that.
[53:38.350 --> 53:42.570]  Apparently, in Ready to Rumble 2, he was a character in it.
[53:42.970 --> 53:43.410]  He did the voice for that.
[53:43.770 --> 53:45.190]  It's his real voice.
[53:45.570 --> 53:48.290]  Yeah, I think he can do a real deep bassy voice.
[53:48.750 --> 53:51.350]  Apparently, I watched a bunch of videos about it.
[53:51.470 --> 53:57.130]  And apparently, anytime he was out with other musicians or movie stars or rappers or whoever,
[53:57.270 --> 53:57.970]  they'd tell him these stories.
[53:58.410 --> 54:00.530]  They'd be like, as soon as everybody would leave the green room,
[54:00.650 --> 54:02.550]  it was just like me and Michael Jordan or Michael Jackson.
[54:02.690 --> 54:05.190]  He'd be like, I thought those motherfuckers would never leave anyway.
[54:05.190 --> 54:09.430]  He'd drop it and just go into a totally macho dude.
[54:10.570 --> 54:12.650]  I have this with Timothy Olyphant.
[54:13.090 --> 54:13.650]  Oh, really?
[54:14.210 --> 54:16.250]  Yeah, that is my conspiracy.
[54:16.750 --> 54:18.890]  I think he is like Mr. Fake Voice.
[54:19.390 --> 54:23.090]  If you watch him in Scream, watch him acting in Scream.
[54:23.150 --> 54:26.170]  He has the most high pitch, nasally voice.
[54:26.870 --> 54:30.010]  And then I watched an interview at around that time, and he has the same voice.
[54:30.210 --> 54:34.430]  And now he always sounds like a really gruff, kind of rustic cowboy.
[54:34.590 --> 54:35.030]  Interesting.
[54:35.030 --> 54:36.290]  Voices can age.
[54:37.510 --> 54:41.270]  It's a complete shift in both tone and style of speaking.
[54:41.610 --> 54:45.390]  I think he put a real effort in because he had a shit voice when he made Scream.
[54:47.550 --> 54:49.930]  He went all like Elizabeth Holmes with it.
[54:51.510 --> 54:56.710]  I posted a TikTok if you want to hear Michael Jackson's supposedly real voice
[54:57.470 --> 54:58.850]  from Ready to Rumble 2.
[54:59.290 --> 55:01.370]  Yeah, apparently that's what he actually sounds like.
[55:01.430 --> 55:05.010]  And the high pitch voice was something he put on for the audience.
[55:05.030 --> 55:07.090]  With this groove, I can't lose!
[55:09.030 --> 55:09.470]  Weird, right?
[55:09.890 --> 55:13.650]  I'm sure you can probably play that in the file too.
[55:13.890 --> 55:14.470]  Yeah, who cares?
[55:14.590 --> 55:15.130]  We can talk about it.
[55:15.130 --> 55:16.470]  It's Ready to Rumble 2, you're fine.
[55:16.550 --> 55:18.270]  We would do a video game in it, so why wouldn't we?
[55:18.390 --> 55:19.610]  Or do a Let's Play in it, why wouldn't we?
[55:19.990 --> 55:20.710]  Yeah, there you go.
[55:21.230 --> 55:22.590]  Andrew, why don't you do your real voice?
[55:23.450 --> 55:25.210]  This is my real voice.
[55:26.490 --> 55:27.370]  It was high pitch!
[55:28.950 --> 55:30.070]  I'm a real boy!
[55:33.810 --> 55:36.110]  I think it would be low, right, my real voice?
[55:37.050 --> 55:37.730]  It would be funnier?
[55:37.830 --> 55:39.210]  I think it's funnier low than high.
[55:40.690 --> 55:42.350]  Oh, my ankle!
[55:42.770 --> 55:44.810]  Nah, it's not. I gotta work on that.
[55:44.830 --> 55:46.590]  Oh, fuck, because every impression he does is this.
[55:46.590 --> 55:47.450]  More, more ankles.
[55:48.490 --> 55:49.990]  He's telling Andrew the giant.
[55:53.410 --> 55:54.330]  Hey, Gavin.
[55:55.570 --> 55:58.530]  You and I have something we gotta do together.
[55:58.530 --> 56:00.250]  We've gotta write our smut.
[56:00.830 --> 56:01.770]  Oh, yeah.
[56:01.990 --> 56:03.130]  Speaking of final runs.
[56:03.230 --> 56:04.870]  I was gonna propose something to you.
[56:05.410 --> 56:06.370]  Let's see how you feel about this.
[56:06.690 --> 56:08.330]  You and I are going together.
[56:08.610 --> 56:09.890]  I don't know if anybody else knows about this,
[56:09.970 --> 56:13.110]  but you and I are going to New York City together to spend the weekend together.
[56:13.790 --> 56:16.490]  Me and you, we're gonna go Friday to Sunday.
[56:17.030 --> 56:18.450]  The girls are gonna be doing something,
[56:18.610 --> 56:21.130]  and so we're gonna have most of the time just to ourselves,
[56:21.210 --> 56:23.570]  I think, except for like dinner and shows and stuff.
[56:23.570 --> 56:28.210]  What if we found the location in New York City
[56:28.210 --> 56:36.310]  that's like the best like poet, like grizzled New York journalist writer bar,
[56:36.530 --> 56:38.950]  where like all the most famous, like all the beat poets,
[56:39.030 --> 56:40.890]  all the most famous literary figures went.
[56:41.190 --> 56:44.630]  And we go there, and that's where we sit down and write our smut.
[56:44.750 --> 56:45.850]  That's where we put pen to paper.
[56:46.010 --> 56:47.370]  It'd be like the time where we were in...
[56:47.370 --> 56:51.050]  What country were we in when we came up with episode 100 of Minecraft?
[56:51.290 --> 56:53.090]  We were in Hungary, I believe.
[56:53.090 --> 56:54.490]  Yeah, used to be like that.
[56:54.890 --> 56:56.810]  Yeah, exactly. I'm trying to recreate that moment.
[56:56.910 --> 56:59.730]  But I thought like we might be inspired if we're at like some dive
[56:59.730 --> 57:02.210]  where like Allen Ginsberg wrote his best stuff.
[57:04.650 --> 57:07.330]  Yeah, we should absolutely do that.
[57:07.410 --> 57:09.330]  Okay. Yeah, Saturday morning.
[57:09.390 --> 57:10.450]  Because I was thinking about today.
[57:10.470 --> 57:12.110]  I was like, what the fuck are we gonna do all day?
[57:12.210 --> 57:12.630]  I don't know.
[57:12.790 --> 57:15.730]  I was like, when was the last time Gavin and I in New York City together?
[57:15.890 --> 57:18.170]  What have we ever done together in New York City?
[57:18.290 --> 57:20.270]  Like, are we just gonna fucking...
[57:20.270 --> 57:22.810]  I think the last time we were both there, we went to Rockstar.
[57:24.090 --> 57:25.590]  Or we did like a live show or something.
[57:25.930 --> 57:28.590]  Yeah, you guys should go back to Rockstar.
[57:28.910 --> 57:31.130]  Maybe let's play. Maybe it's a let's play live or something.
[57:32.910 --> 57:38.330]  I can't believe that that GTA 6 trailer came out and then it said 2025 at the end.
[57:39.370 --> 57:42.870]  And then I just thought about how many GTAs I have left in my life.
[57:43.070 --> 57:44.270]  And I think it's three.
[57:44.710 --> 57:46.170]  Maybe, maybe three.
[57:47.330 --> 57:49.950]  I actually wrote that as a comment on the trailer.
[57:49.950 --> 57:53.010]  It got like 300,000 likes.
[57:53.150 --> 57:54.910]  Oh my god!
[57:58.610 --> 58:02.030]  That being said, how fucking cool is that trailer?
[58:02.570 --> 58:03.870]  Oh, I can't wait.
[58:03.890 --> 58:04.310]  It's very cool.
[58:04.510 --> 58:05.770]  I can't wait for us to play it.
[58:06.070 --> 58:11.850]  I know it's gonna be 50% of what we see there when you actually get into multiplayer and
[58:11.850 --> 58:12.670]  sit down to play it.
[58:12.830 --> 58:16.210]  But 50% of what I saw in that trailer is fucking awesome.
[58:16.570 --> 58:17.210]  You know what I mean?
[58:17.770 --> 58:21.330]  Yeah, but I just have a hard time getting excited for something that's going to come
[58:21.330 --> 58:22.890]  out long after I'm dead.
[58:24.770 --> 58:27.110]  Yeah, look at the top comment on that.
[58:30.950 --> 58:32.890]  Do you think you won't make it, Eric?
[58:33.250 --> 58:34.210]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[58:35.310 --> 58:40.590]  At this point, at the time of recording, the video's been up for 22 hours and it has 88
[58:40.590 --> 58:41.610]  million views.
[58:42.010 --> 58:45.450]  Wait, you made your comment from the Slow Mo Guys account?
[58:45.450 --> 58:47.790]  What other account am I going to make it from?
[58:49.310 --> 58:50.450]  It's my account.
[58:51.730 --> 58:53.630]  I don't know why that's so funny.
[58:53.990 --> 58:55.130]  Slow Mo Guys.
[58:55.510 --> 58:57.650]  I got three GTAs on that.
[58:58.350 --> 59:00.130]  I'll be a comment leaver for GTA.
[59:00.630 --> 59:04.670]  I've been logged into YouTube as Achievement Hunter for maybe 12 years.
[59:05.030 --> 59:09.130]  And so anytime I do any commenting on YouTube, it's as Achievement Hunter.
[59:09.850 --> 59:11.530]  425,000 likes, Gavin.
[59:11.650 --> 59:12.390]  Jesus Christ.
[59:12.750 --> 59:12.850]  Wow.
[59:13.510 --> 59:16.230]  Like a statement to the view count on that video.
[59:16.850 --> 59:19.510]  You should amend it to say, also listen to F*** Face.
[59:22.610 --> 59:25.510]  That's a lot of F*** Face related replies to my comment.
[59:26.110 --> 59:28.190]  There's some funny ones like, eat the pencil.
[59:28.710 --> 59:29.970]  And there's some really sad ones.
[59:30.290 --> 59:35.450]  Like a guy saying, he was like, I'm 68, so this is probably my last one.
[59:35.670 --> 59:39.310]  Oh my god.
[59:39.330 --> 59:41.490]  I mean, he's assuming he makes it to 2025.
[59:41.990 --> 59:42.390]  Yeah.
[59:42.790 --> 59:44.250]  You know, it's going to get pushed.
[59:44.470 --> 59:45.670]  Oh, yeah.
[59:45.830 --> 59:50.510]  I feel like they've already built in the delay.
[59:50.790 --> 59:51.330]  With 2025?
[59:52.550 --> 59:53.310]  There's no way.
[59:53.430 --> 59:54.130]  It's 2026.
[59:54.430 --> 59:56.190]  It depends on where in 2025.
[59:56.450 --> 59:58.030]  I bet you $100, Gavin.
[59:58.970 --> 01:00:02.030]  I bet you a thousand cents.
[01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:04.290]  Hey, you know what, Gavin?
[01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:05.390]  You're on.
[01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:07.790]  I think it's got to be at least 2026.
[01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:09.590]  I just don't think there's any way it comes out 2025.
[01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:11.650]  Okay, I bet you $100 is 2025.
[01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:12.890]  Okay, okay.
[01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:16.810]  You should have kept it at a hundred cents or a thousand cents.
[01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:19.710]  And that way you'd have to give him pennies, though.
[01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:24.410]  Yeah, but that's going to be a lot of work for him to go get a bunch of pennies.
[01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:30.210]  I bet you $100 in shark cards that it releases in 2027.
[01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:38.390]  I think someone calculated that all the times that I got mugged added together
[01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:41.970]  came out to be something like $18 worth of real money.
[01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:47.850]  It was honestly like millions of dollars that I got mugged for.
[01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:49.330]  Well worth it.
[01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:50.650]  Maybe like hundreds of thousands.
[01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:57.990]  I don't want to undercut this, but I wanted to get to a note that we had that just said
[01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:59.130]  Wheel of Years.
[01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:02.350]  And we said we were going to talk about whatever that is.
[01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:03.130]  What is that?
[01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:04.310]  Oh, I have it in my notes.
[01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:07.930]  I wrote down Wheel of Years Idea, and then I amended it to say,
[01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.950]  What was that about?
[01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:10.310]  Can't remember idea.
[01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:11.030]  Come on.
[01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:13.470]  Are we deciding on the next season?
[01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.610]  No, I have since remembered it.
[01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:18.210]  I just thought that was funny.
[01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:20.750]  I just went, you just sent me, you pretzeled me.
[01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:22.290]  My brain, I don't know how to process.
[01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.150]  We were lost, then we were found.
[01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:24.790]  Yep.
[01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:25.810]  Wheel of Years Idea.
[01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:27.190]  What was that about?
[01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:28.290]  Can't remember idea.
[01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:32.470]  Did you make an addition to that that was actually, I do remember?
[01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:33.570]  No, I just remember.
[01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:34.710]  I just have since remembered.
[01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:41.170]  That was the majority of all the Minecraft ideas, except Geoff had a lot of them written.
[01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:44.210]  So it was like that kind of thing written, but in his handwriting.
[01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:45.870]  Yeah, that made it harder.
[01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:50.990]  And Geoff's handwriting looks like, it looks like like Ryan Dunn's tattoos.
[01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:54.870]  It looks about as good as my photos.
[01:01:56.790 --> 01:02:00.910]  I think the genesis of the idea was that we make a big wheel,
[01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:02.590]  kind of like the Wheel of Punishment.
[01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:08.170]  We have an extra life like the Jack Wheel, you know, but it's like different years.
[01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:12.970]  Out of order from like, let's say 1965 to now.
[01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:20.130]  And you like one of us takes a turn and they spin it and then whatever year they land on,
[01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:26.910]  they have to then go research and find a movie to then present to us that we watch together.
[01:02:27.970 --> 01:02:28.530]  Okay.
[01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:33.650]  Oh, like a weird movie that, you know, like like something that would be watch along worthy.
[01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:36.210]  I like it.
[01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:41.870]  It was I think it was like somewhere in there and I never fully flushed the idea out,
[01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:44.890]  but that's where I was. I was headed somewhere like that with this.
[01:02:45.070 --> 01:02:47.990]  And so it's not a fully it's not a fully baked idea necessarily.
[01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:51.530]  I remember that I thought about a second wheel, maybe that it was like movies,
[01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:55.970]  TVs or music, or maybe a second wheel that it was like genre, like comedy,
[01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:58.910]  horror, adventure. And then you spin, but I don't know.
[01:02:59.050 --> 01:03:02.850]  But I just thought it would be fun to like figure out a way to randomize
[01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:04.630]  our searches for old weird stuff.
[01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:10.750]  Now, do we need do you need it to be a physical wheel or could we do like a digital wheel?
[01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:14.850]  I would like it to be a physical wheel. I think they're more they're more fun.
[01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:17.430]  And they have the clicking. Oh, my God.
[01:03:18.350 --> 01:03:21.890]  I don't you can get there's there's virtual clicking noises.
[01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:23.810]  That's true. But we have the wheel.
[01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:28.930]  That's yeah, but we can have Gavin click the whole time when he sees the little ticker go.
[01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:30.470]  I don't know. It's fair. Yes.
[01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:33.250]  Yeah, we can do it virtually. I don't give a shit.
[01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:35.710]  It's just it's just like some some love.
[01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:38.990]  I think I probably had it more worked out when I was going to present it to you guys
[01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:42.730]  two weeks ago or whenever. And then it's just like it's just shit out of my brain.
[01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:46.170]  Do you want to do a wheel spin right now?
[01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:49.070]  I don't on this thing.
[01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:51.470]  Yeah, on this. Do you want to do a wheel spin right?
[01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:52.470]  Well, I don't know. We could use.
[01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:55.230]  OK, well, yeah, but we'll have to do to do it properly.
[01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:58.250]  Can we do a wheel spin to randomize who it is?
[01:03:58.470 --> 01:04:00.270]  Like, can we do a wheel spin and then?
[01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:01.330]  Oh, I like that. Yeah.
[01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:04.770]  Yeah. Spin to see who will then have to spin the wheel.
[01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:06.170]  Yeah. Spin to see who spins.
[01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.190]  So how do we pre spin?
[01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:09.290]  Hang on.
[01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:12.170]  Just put everyone's names in it and then share the screen.
[01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:14.970]  Everybody records.
[01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:19.510]  Also, while while Eric's doing that, we were talking yesterday and we think
[01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:22.510]  we've decided that we'd both look pretty good with extensions.
[01:04:23.170 --> 01:04:25.510]  And then we were thinking about who would look the best with extensions.
[01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:27.850]  And we decided we want to do a supplemental video
[01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:30.930]  where we all have to where Emily puts extensions in all of us.
[01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:32.730]  And then we have like a little beauty contest to see.
[01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:34.950]  I think it would be fun just to have this length hair,
[01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:36.910]  but to get extensions, I think it would look cool.
[01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:39.750]  Nick, you're my you're my dark horse to win it.
[01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:41.810]  Wow. All right.
[01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:43.610]  I even put Gracie in, so that's fun.
[01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:45.790]  I think Nick's got the best head for a mullet.
[01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:48.450]  Oh, no. Yeah, I could see that.
[01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:49.910]  Yeah, actually, I agree with that.
[01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:51.890]  I think it's probably I think it would look good on Nick.
[01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:54.290]  All right. Come on. I heard what you said there.
[01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:58.870]  OK, for some reason, we're spinning this wheel.
[01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:02.430]  What happens when somebody wins?
[01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:05.390]  They then have to spin the wheel of numbers, I believe.
[01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:08.630]  I like that as soon as as soon as we added a name to
[01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:12.570]  an egg or egg or whatever we change it to, we added another G name.
[01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:13.870]  Yes. Yeah.
[01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:18.450]  Oh, so it's just an egg, longer G's.
[01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:20.490]  It's just more G's, right?
[01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:22.110]  We could be Gan-Gag.
[01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:25.110]  We can be Gan-Gag.
[01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:26.390]  We can be all sorts of things.
[01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:28.530]  Yeah. Thank you, Andrew.
[01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:29.530]  Yeah, you're welcome.
[01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:32.670]  I'm just saying you can just throw out ideas all day.
[01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:34.410]  We can be Gan-Gag or a second idea.
[01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:35.290]  Yep.
[01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:41.430]  All right, Eric, are you going to spin the wheel?
[01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:42.370]  Let's do it.
[01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:44.270]  Can you share your screen?
[01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.770]  Okay, cool.
[01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:46.550]  Here's the wheel to spin.
[01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:50.210]  Whoever this lands on gets to spin the wheel of years.
[01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:53.950]  It's spinning.
[01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:57.050]  And the winner is... no way.
[01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:01.070]  And the winner is Gracie!
[01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:02.430]  The winner is Gracie.
[01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:04.710]  Congratulations, Gracie.
[01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.450]  You get to spin the wheel of years.
[01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:09.250]  Thank God.
[01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:11.430]  All right, Gracie.
[01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:13.170]  So, can you share your screen?
[01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:14.290]  What?
[01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:15.050]  What?
[01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:16.490]  Well, so we can see her spin the wheel.
[01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.350]  We're doing this right now?
[01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:19.790]  Oh, okay.
[01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:20.530]  Well, we don't have to.
[01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:24.090]  Well, I just assumed Eric would put numbers in and then it would be the same thing.
[01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:25.250]  And it was just...
[01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:26.070]  Oh, we can do that too.
[01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:26.930]  Eric, put...
[01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:27.870]  Yeah, let's do it that way.
[01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:28.690]  Put like...
[01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:29.710]  You want me to put numbers in?
[01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:30.990]  1950, 1970...
[01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.630]  No, yeah.
[01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:32.290]  1962.
[01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:33.530]  I'll give you the numbers.
[01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:35.170]  I've lost track of what's going on.
[01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:36.930]  So we're...
[01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:38.270]  You've lost track of what's going on?
[01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:39.930]  So we just spun a wheel of names.
[01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:41.070]  So now it's Gracie.
[01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:43.790]  And now we're going to spin the wheel of years.
[01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:48.010]  And once a year is determined, Gracie then needs to pick a film from that year
[01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:48.950]  that we will watch.
[01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:50.170]  To present to us that we'll watch together.
[01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:51.570]  Okay.
[01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:53.230]  Yeah, what don't you get?
[01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:55.690]  Well, I just didn't know we were doing this now in this episode.
[01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:58.770]  You're the one that was supportive of it and said you liked the idea.
[01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:01.070]  I was one that was like, I don't know if this is any good.
[01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:02.530]  I don't know if it's fully baked yet.
[01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:03.890]  I also liked drafts when he described it.
[01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:06.410]  That didn't mean we just stopped making the episode and did drafts.
[01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:08.830]  Can I ask at what point...
[01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:11.390]  When I said, Gavin, why don't we do this now?
[01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:12.410]  And you went, yeah.
[01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:13.470]  Where was the...
[01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:15.430]  I mean, it's a great question.
[01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:16.670]  Oh, it is a good question.
[01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:22.530]  Okay, so what I've done is that I have put all the numbers from 1960 to 2023 in random.
[01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:23.670]  Okay, great.
[01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:25.970]  So that way they randomize here.
[01:07:26.550 --> 01:07:27.170]  That's excellent.
[01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:28.810]  Now, why would it do that?
[01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:34.370]  Why would it put a number in front of all of them so I can't...
[01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:34.850]  You know what?
[01:07:35.330 --> 01:07:36.010]  Oh, cool.
[01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:36.610]  It's fine.
[01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:37.270]  It doesn't...
[01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:37.430]  Oh, he did it.
[01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:38.410]  Yeah, he did it.
[01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:39.670]  All right, we're doing it.
[01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:40.330]  All right, copy.
[01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:41.350]  Got it.
[01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.270]  We'll minimize the numbers.
[01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:45.310]  And now he's going to insert the random.
[01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:46.210]  Yes!
[01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:50.110]  That's exactly what I thought it would look like.
[01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:51.210]  All right, Gracie.
[01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:54.130]  Gracie, this is the wheel of numbers.
[01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:56.690]  And what's going to happen is we're going to spin it.
[01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:58.790]  And then we're...
[01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:02.250]  Whatever year it lands on, you are tasked with picking a movie that we watch.
[01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:03.750]  How about to make it more personalized?
[01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:05.410]  Gracie, how many spins would you like?
[01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:08.810]  Oh, let's do four.
[01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:09.970]  Four spins!
[01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:13.130]  You should also say click when Eric should click.
[01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:14.370]  No, that's your job, Gavin.
[01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:17.490]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:20.270]  Now, do we want it...
[01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:21.170]  Does it have to be movie?
[01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:23.010]  Are we okay with it being a TV show?
[01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:24.170]  A TV show as well.
[01:08:24.190 --> 01:08:26.750]  I think it should be open for media.
[01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:28.270]  I think it's a piece of viewable media.
[01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:29.650]  A piece of viewable media.
[01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:30.570]  That's a great way to put it.
[01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:31.950]  Because it's not music.
[01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:33.890]  It's got to be like a movie show, something like that.
[01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:37.010]  Oh, also there was a shuffle here that I didn't...
[01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:37.910]  I wasn't aware of.
[01:08:39.230 --> 01:08:41.610]  I like the way you did it.
[01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:42.950]  Oh, fuck.
[01:08:43.190 --> 01:08:43.370]  Okay.
[01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:45.470]  All right, Gracie, call it.
[01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.750]  Click.
[01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:47.570]  All right, here we go.
[01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:49.790]  Our first spin is...
[01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:55.270]  1991.
[01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:01.150]  Okay, so irrelevant on...
[01:09:01.150 --> 01:09:02.850]  Do we want to remove it?
[01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:03.950]  No, you got to keep it.
[01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:05.490]  Because what if it's 1991 again, baby?
[01:09:05.650 --> 01:09:06.830]  It's truly random.
[01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:08.310]  All right, Gracie, let me know when.
[01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:10.910]  Click.
[01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:11.510]  Got it.
[01:09:11.730 --> 01:09:12.290]  All right, here we go.
[01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:13.150]  Our second spin.
[01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:14.730]  This is a weird episode.
[01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:16.890]  I'm not getting any clicks from you, Gavin.
[01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:17.810]  I'm very disappointed.
[01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:19.270]  I'm clicking with the second year.
[01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:20.090]  What are you talking about?
[01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:21.370]  What?
[01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:22.230]  1992!
[01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:24.710]  Oh my god, it's a human progression.
[01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:27.410]  This is so exciting.
[01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:30.090]  I'm clicking so much my fingers hurt.
[01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:31.250]  Are you serious?
[01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:32.670]  None of it's coming through.
[01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:33.250]  I'll click.
[01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:33.830]  I'll auto-click.
[01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:35.010]  All right, here we go.
[01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:35.990]  Gracie, you let me know when.
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:43.380]  Click.
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:51.860]  1978!
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:58.920]  And now, this will be our final spin.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.840]  Let's take a bet.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.300]  Pick a year.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.060]  What year do you guys think it'll be?
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.120]  1988.
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:07.880]  Okay, oh, 1997, 98.
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:09.300]  Okay, 1986.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.380]  Oh, that's good.
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:12.140]  2006.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.780]  Okay, Gracie, what number do you think it's going to be?
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:17.440]  I hope it's something when I was alive.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:18.980]  So, anything she doesn't want to know.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.920]  I'm going to say, honestly, I'm going to say 1995.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.420]  That's going to be my guess.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:25.700]  Here we go.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:26.360]  What is the win again?
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:28.920]  I don't think anything.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.180]  I think it's just a fun thing that we're doing.
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.840]  Brag, yeah, you get a brag about it.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.200]  All right, Gracie, whenever you're ready.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:39.460]  Okay, let me get ready.
[01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:47.570]  Here it comes.
[01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:50.770]  Our spin is winding down and it is...
[01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.710]  1964.
[01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:00.630]  Wow, 1964.
[01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:04.230]  I am so excited to see what Gracie will pick.
[01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:07.630]  That's awesome.
[01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:10.110]  That's like before her parents were born.
[01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:11.190]  So that's pretty exciting.
[01:11:11.490 --> 01:11:13.090]  My parents were not born in that year.
[01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:14.150]  No, absolutely not.
[01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.710]  The worst movies of 1964.
[01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:22.270]  According to this list, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.
[01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:25.950]  It's not just you, Murray.
[01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:30.130]  The incredible strange creatures who stopped living and became...
[01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:31.410]  What?
[01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.910]  Cut off.
[01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:33.930]  Who became...
[01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:35.210]  We will never know.
[01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.910]  Mixed up zombies.
[01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:40.450]  Didn't we watch Mystery Science Theater of the people who stopped living and became...
[01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:41.170]  We might have.
[01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:42.670]  Back Door to Hell.
[01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:45.130]  Oh, there was a movie called Teenage Strangler.
[01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:45.990]  Wow.
[01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:47.950]  Swedish Wedding Night.
[01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:51.030]  Poncho's Hideaway.
[01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:52.650]  Okay, so there's a lot of bad looking movies.
[01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:53.690]  The Creeping Terror.
[01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:54.530]  Oh, that's a classic.
[01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:56.270]  I said that one already.
[01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:58.370]  Did anyone hear him say Goldfinger?
[01:11:58.650 --> 01:11:58.950]  No.
[01:11:59.470 --> 01:12:01.930]  The Horror of Party Beach.
[01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:07.190]  Sloppy Seconds has a song about that movie.
[01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:13.390]  Well, Gracie, you'll have a lot to pick from, including Elvis Kissin' Cousins.
[01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:16.110]  So it can sort of be anything.
[01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:17.770]  It's up to you.
[01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:18.970]  Think long and hard.
[01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:21.950]  You have, I suppose, a week to let us know.
[01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:25.730]  I think our next recording and then we'll go from there.
[01:12:26.170 --> 01:12:28.370]  Then you can present the movie and then we can watch it whenever.
[01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:33.010]  And then after we've watched the movie, then the next person can spin the wheel.
[01:12:33.230 --> 01:12:34.190]  It's very exciting.
[01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:35.090]  We'll do it again.
[01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.590]  I like it.
[01:12:35.710 --> 01:12:37.310]  And then, yeah, and then it just...
[01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:39.990]  And then I'm hoping, I think I was hoping more than anything,
[01:12:40.210 --> 01:12:41.770]  that the wheel would look cool.
[01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:42.690]  And I think it did.
[01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:45.070]  And that we'll find other ways to use it.
[01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:46.830]  Yeah, I loved it.
[01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:49.150]  Well, there you have it.
[01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:50.070]  That's the episode.
[01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:51.110]  Click.
[01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.370]  All right, you guys.
[01:12:55.930 --> 01:13:00.990]  Hey, as we're leaving, Eric and I got a pretty cool pull yesterday on the Break Show.
[01:13:01.150 --> 01:13:02.330]  Did you guys see that by any chance?
[01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:03.710]  I missed it.
[01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:08.990]  We pulled a Julius Caesar relic.
[01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:11.230]  A knife?
[01:13:11.230 --> 01:13:12.850]  A one of 99 knife?
[01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:16.890]  It's a piece of leather from a tunic that he wore.
[01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:17.910]  Wow.
[01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:24.170]  So now F*** Face owns a piece of like a legitimate piece of Julius Caesar's clothes.
[01:13:24.170 --> 01:13:25.350]  It looks like that.
[01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:26.690]  And then it has...
[01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:26.890]  How is it legitimate?
[01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:29.150]  That's what I'm saying, Gavin.
[01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:30.170]  There's no way.
[01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:30.930]  It is.
[01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:31.410]  There's no way.
[01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:34.970]  They buy them authenticated at like auctions.
[01:13:35.170 --> 01:13:36.130]  And then they cut them up.
[01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:38.010]  And they're all completely above board.
[01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:41.050]  It's uh, it's let's f***ing we own some Caesar, baby.
[01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:42.990]  That dude died before Jesus.
[01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:46.610]  Well, thanks for listening to F*** Face.
[01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:49.710]  Real strong ending on this one today.
[01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:50.850]  185.
[01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:53.570]  Gracie has to pick a movie from 1964.
[01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:55.650]  And we're very excited.
[01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:59.870]  You can follow us at F*** Face Pod on Instagram and on Twitter.
[01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:03.290]  And you can go to F*** Face Pod dot com slash first and sign up to support us directly and
[01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:05.130]  watch our first stuff, which is Let's Plays.
[01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:06.590]  And that's pretty much it.
[01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:08.990]  Anything else so we can wrap this thing up?
[01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:10.890]  Gracie, have you ever seen a film that old?
[01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:13.430]  Actually, yes, in school.
[01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:14.510]  What's the old?
[01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:19.430]  You may not know it off the top of your head, but what's the oldest movie you've ever seen?
[01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:23.310]  Probably like It Happened One Night.
[01:14:23.670 --> 01:14:23.830]  Yeah.
[01:14:24.170 --> 01:14:25.670]  OK, there you go.
[01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:28.170]  Hey, do you guys think we should do a murder draft?
[01:14:28.290 --> 01:14:29.270]  I was thinking about that.
[01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:30.330]  No.
[01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:31.110]  Best Murders?
[01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:33.570]  Because I'm going to be in the first round.
[01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:34.790]  So that's true.
[01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:37.910]  I was also thinking, what if we did a person draft?
[01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:41.070]  Like, what if we just did a draft of, like, Nick Cage movies?
[01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.710]  You've...
[01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.830]  Pitched that before?
[01:14:45.210 --> 01:14:45.650]  I just like Nick Cage.
[01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:47.150]  I just like Nick Cage.
[01:14:47.210 --> 01:14:47.850]  I just want to do Nick Cage.
[01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:50.070]  You've pitched that before, I'd argue, in a better format.
[01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:51.030]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:52.990]  Oh, the fight cage match thing?
[01:14:53.210 --> 01:14:53.410]  Yeah.
[01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:55.090]  When's the best episode going to be?
[01:14:55.170 --> 01:14:56.050]  Like 187 or something?
[01:14:56.050 --> 01:14:57.190]  Oh my god.
[01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:58.250]  All right, bye.
[01:14:58.770 --> 01:14:59.170]  Bye.
[01:15:00.010 --> 01:15:00.370]  Goodbye.
[01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:03.950]  What about a year?
[01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:05.210]  A wheel of months?
[01:15:05.410 --> 01:15:07.750]  Oh my god, cut, cut, cut, cut.
[01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:08.710]  Everyone stop.
[01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:09.230]  No more.
[01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:14.190]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:15.910]  How do you spike a heart rate?
[01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:17.510]  The intro happened.
[01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:18.650]  Cornhole anyone?
[01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:20.950]  Geoff forgot the butterfly pose.
[01:15:21.330 --> 01:15:22.250]  Accidental audio.
[01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:23.730]  Let's go ice skating.
[01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:26.150]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:29.210]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
