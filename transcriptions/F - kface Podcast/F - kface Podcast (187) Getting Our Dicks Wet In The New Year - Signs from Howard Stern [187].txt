[00:37.080 --> 00:43.620]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. This is episode 187.
[00:44.160 --> 00:48.220]  It's an ominous number. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[00:48.360 --> 00:51.780]  And this is the first podcast of 2024. Hello!
[00:52.260 --> 00:54.140]  How are you not sweating on your arsehole?
[00:54.380 --> 00:55.420]  What do you mean, sweating?
[00:55.940 --> 01:01.340]  Well, she said after she waxed, just don't sweat there. But how do you... that's easier said than done.
[01:02.360 --> 01:06.840]  Wait, your instructions were don't sweat there?
[01:06.960 --> 01:09.040]  Yeah, she did say that, yeah.
[01:09.260 --> 01:15.740]  Maybe baby powder your arsehole? Like, I don't know, that's not a thing you could will, but maybe you could do preventative stuff?
[01:16.100 --> 01:19.840]  I don't know if I'm gonna pour baby powder in my freshly yanked follicles.
[01:19.880 --> 01:21.620]  I mean, you already shoved hot wax.
[01:21.760 --> 01:29.320]  I don't know that my arsehole sweats that much on an average day.
[01:29.320 --> 01:37.080]  I got a reasonable temperature in the house, I'm not wearing too many clothes, so I'm not super worried about a sweaty butt.
[01:37.160 --> 01:39.400]  Are you having sweat problems? Did you turn the air down?
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.580]  No, I'm just self-conscious about it. I just sat on a chair and I've got sort of a new trappage area.
[01:46.180 --> 01:48.340]  There's less... there's more of a seal now.
[01:48.720 --> 01:52.600]  I also think that... oh, that was weird, I just moved in my...
[01:53.960 --> 01:55.640]  It is taking some getting used to.
[01:55.980 --> 01:57.020]  Happy New Year, by the way.
[01:57.620 --> 01:58.720]  Happy New Year!
[01:59.300 --> 02:04.560]  Okay, so that's... okay, before we get more into the assholes and everything, it is Happy New Year.
[02:04.700 --> 02:06.500]  What are we doing about Nick wearing the mask?
[02:07.340 --> 02:07.740]  Oh!
[02:08.540 --> 02:09.320]  Oh, it starts today!
[02:09.320 --> 02:14.080]  There's no way that he's started... there's no way... he has to wear it before we start, right?
[02:14.500 --> 02:15.160]  If he...
[02:15.160 --> 02:17.440]  Yeah, he can't just put it on in, like, the middle.
[02:17.720 --> 02:23.560]  I just want to make sure... this is... people keep raising it to me, and I don't want to hear about it anymore.
[02:23.780 --> 02:25.880]  So, like, we need to figure out what's going on here.
[02:25.880 --> 02:27.440]  Bullets are back in guns.
[02:27.740 --> 02:31.740]  Yeah, Nick has 52 chances to wear the mask, but he has to wear it the whole episode.
[02:32.200 --> 02:32.300]  Yeah.
[02:32.380 --> 02:35.960]  And if he gets it by us, he wins again.
[02:36.300 --> 02:40.640]  Okay, but wasn't there something where we were doing it, like, quarterly or something?
[02:40.860 --> 02:41.260]  Oh!
[02:42.260 --> 02:43.600]  We each get one guess.
[02:44.300 --> 02:44.600]  Mm-hmm.
[02:44.960 --> 02:50.880]  And then we said we were going to listen extra hard in certain times, right?
[02:50.880 --> 02:53.520]  Oh, yeah. So who's taking Q1? I can't remember.
[02:54.200 --> 02:56.240]  Q1 is Gavin, I've decided.
[02:56.400 --> 02:58.420]  Oh, no way! I was in Q1, was I?
[02:59.280 --> 03:04.880]  Yeah, as of right now, you are. Q2 is Andrew. I'll be Q3, and then Eric can be Q4.
[03:05.100 --> 03:06.200]  And I guess we have...
[03:06.200 --> 03:06.700]  If it gets that far.
[03:06.740 --> 03:08.420]  We have recruited Gracie now, so...
[03:08.420 --> 03:13.480]  We do, yeah. Gracie maybe has, like, a floating... like, she's really just got to, like, keep an ear open the whole time.
[03:13.760 --> 03:15.400]  Yeah, you get a guess, too, Gracie.
[03:15.840 --> 03:17.780]  Gracie, you have no idea what the fuck we're talking about.
[03:18.440 --> 03:29.460]  So Nick is going to wear the monkey mask on one episode of this show, and we have to figure out which episode it's in, but we only get one guess each.
[03:29.840 --> 03:31.460]  So Nick is trying to trick us.
[03:31.720 --> 03:33.240]  Yeah, he's trying to do a Nick trick.
[03:33.540 --> 03:39.100]  What if Nick was so on the ball, so ahead of the game, and he just plunked it on between recordings?
[03:39.540 --> 03:40.320]  There's no way.
[03:40.720 --> 03:41.600]  There's no way, right?
[03:41.660 --> 03:43.360]  I don't think he has the guts.
[03:43.360 --> 03:49.240]  That would have been the move, though, but I feel like Nick was maybe too distracted today with all the anus stuff.
[03:49.380 --> 03:51.660]  It's probably the most safe he would have been.
[03:51.700 --> 03:52.000]  Maybe?
[03:53.000 --> 03:54.500]  Oh, that's some bullshit.
[03:54.900 --> 03:56.080]  He's, like, deliberately muffling himself.
[03:56.080 --> 03:59.020]  He is trying so hard to make it sound like he's in a mask.
[03:59.040 --> 04:01.140]  I'm gonna fall for that fake-out shit!
[04:08.380 --> 04:12.180]  You sounded completely different to that point than just all of a sudden...
[04:12.180 --> 04:16.220]  Nick has waxy assholes on the brain today.
[04:16.260 --> 04:17.780]  He's not thinking about his monkey mask.
[04:18.400 --> 04:21.680]  Also, Nick, I think, favors episodes without Eric.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.300]  So I think I'm gonna be more... because that's how he did it last time.
[04:24.480 --> 04:25.600]  Oh, interesting. Interesting.
[04:27.120 --> 04:29.680]  Okay, now we have that figured out.
[04:29.860 --> 04:32.580]  We have the Nick mask situation figured out.
[04:32.740 --> 04:36.120]  And we're talking about your assholes right now.
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.410]  Can I ask you guys, the time of this recording is the day that you guys have gotten waxed.
[04:40.410 --> 04:45.650]  Can you, when something feels weird or just kind of piques your interest,
[04:45.730 --> 04:49.490]  like, with your buttholes over, like, the next few weeks,
[04:49.690 --> 04:50.990]  can you just, like, make a note?
[04:51.170 --> 04:53.870]  Just jot it down somewhere on your phone or something and bring it up.
[04:54.190 --> 04:57.570]  Oh, sorry. Do you not have enough information about our assholes yet?
[04:58.050 --> 04:59.110]  Uh, no.
[04:59.230 --> 05:00.750]  I mean, we did get 30 minutes of it.
[05:00.790 --> 05:04.210]  Here's the thing. I have information on your smooth, smooth buttholes.
[05:04.370 --> 05:06.520]  But as time goes, hair returns.
[05:06.520 --> 05:10.980]  And I feel like with Geoff, I don't know if it's ever going to come back fully.
[05:11.120 --> 05:15.460]  But with you, I imagine in two or three days, you're going to be back in, like, true form.
[05:15.600 --> 05:17.720]  And I want to know what that feels like.
[05:18.140 --> 05:23.120]  She did say your ass hair will grow back softer than before.
[05:23.300 --> 05:24.680]  It'll actually be nicer.
[05:25.380 --> 05:29.560]  So we are looking for, like, I will say I'm noticing one thing where, like,
[05:30.120 --> 05:34.600]  one side of my ass is sticking to the other side of my ass in a way that it's never done before.
[05:34.600 --> 05:36.380]  I think that the hair breaks that seal.
[05:36.560 --> 05:41.700]  And so, uh, it is a little uncomfortable to have, like, sticky, like, yeah.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.040]  Like, sticky asshole.
[05:43.820 --> 05:46.640]  But that also might just be leftover wax or whatever, too.
[05:46.780 --> 05:47.160]  Probably.
[05:48.020 --> 05:48.620]  I don't know.
[05:48.980 --> 05:49.320]  I don't know.
[05:49.460 --> 05:50.300]  Yeah, we'll keep you updated.
[05:51.120 --> 05:56.880]  I mean, I just think it's important to, like, walk the audience through this process as your hair grows back
[05:56.880 --> 06:02.400]  and you have sticky asshole or slick poops or whatever's going on.
[06:02.460 --> 06:03.200]  I just think it's important.
[06:03.200 --> 06:05.600]  I mean, when you plant a seed, you want to see it grow.
[06:05.920 --> 06:08.000]  It's important to get these updates as we progress.
[06:08.460 --> 06:09.920]  Shall I time-lapse it coming back?
[06:10.400 --> 06:10.840]  Yes.
[06:11.580 --> 06:13.020]  Also, tell us if it's softer.
[06:13.360 --> 06:13.460]  Verbally.
[06:14.880 --> 06:18.820]  Let us know how it feels growing a Chewbacca from your anus.
[06:20.800 --> 06:21.740]  Keep us updated.
[06:22.180 --> 06:22.940]  Did you find the money yet?
[06:23.280 --> 06:24.340]  I haven't found the money yet.
[06:24.740 --> 06:26.380]  I'll look more into that a bit later.
[06:26.760 --> 06:28.140]  It'd be real great if you found it right now.
[06:28.400 --> 06:29.240]  It would be?
[06:29.740 --> 06:31.360]  Should I just focus on thumbsticks?
[06:32.040 --> 06:32.440]  Let me look.
[06:34.300 --> 06:40.520]  You're asking me to find it, so I'm just confirming that you want my focus on that instead of being more focused on the show.
[06:41.100 --> 06:41.740]  I'm looking.
[06:41.860 --> 06:42.480]  This is the show.
[06:43.360 --> 06:44.440]  Yeah, but I'm...
[06:45.740 --> 06:47.020]  Eric, you understand what I'm saying.
[06:47.440 --> 06:52.640]  Yeah, and I can't imagine how mad it would make me if I said, do you want me to do this to focus on the show?
[06:52.900 --> 06:55.500]  And somebody told me, this is the show.
[06:55.800 --> 06:58.380]  I would be so... I'd be fucking livid.
[06:59.840 --> 07:01.280]  Where are we going next?
[07:01.280 --> 07:03.980]  Car? Okay, fucking die. Fine, whatever.
[07:04.380 --> 07:09.940]  We're legitimately recording the show right now. What better time could we have for him to find it than right now?
[07:10.000 --> 07:11.060]  We don't want him to find it on camera.
[07:11.320 --> 07:12.600]  Okay, fair enough. Fair enough.
[07:12.860 --> 07:17.360]  We also, at some point soon, need to actually put beans in the new bean hole.
[07:17.720 --> 07:18.040]  Yes.
[07:18.300 --> 07:22.500]  Because, as people have correctly pointed out, all they have is dirt from a dirt hole.
[07:22.820 --> 07:23.100]  No.
[07:23.560 --> 07:26.880]  But that's pre-bean. All that is is pre-bean.
[07:26.880 --> 07:31.880]  You gotta take the dirt out of the hole before you can put the beans in the hole.
[07:32.080 --> 07:36.300]  Right, but what I'm saying is until beans have hit the hole, they don't actually have bean hole dirt yet.
[07:36.700 --> 07:37.960]  Alright, well what are you doing this weekend?
[07:38.500 --> 07:39.220]  Yeah, what's up?
[07:39.700 --> 07:40.220]  Cooking beans?
[07:40.820 --> 07:42.100]  Let's cook some beans this weekend.
[07:42.120 --> 07:42.700]  Let's cook some beans.
[07:43.100 --> 07:45.280]  You wanna have a little beany Saturday?
[07:45.940 --> 07:48.640]  Yeah, a little Christmas beany Saturday.
[07:50.280 --> 07:51.080]  Let's do it.
[07:51.560 --> 07:53.880]  Okay. I gotta go buy the supplies.
[07:54.940 --> 07:55.340]  Beans?
[07:56.180 --> 07:58.880]  I fuckin', I gotta get a new Dutch oven thing.
[07:59.140 --> 08:00.060]  You gotta get new dirt.
[08:00.500 --> 08:01.360]  What are you gonna do differently?
[08:01.920 --> 08:06.420]  I left the last one in my backyard just to, like, I cleaned it out. I threw the beans away.
[08:06.420 --> 08:11.340]  But I left the thing just in the backyard to rust. I was like so mad at it. So I gotta buy a new one.
[08:14.440 --> 08:18.100]  It's gonna sink into the ground and then some little asshole can dig it up and find it.
[08:18.400 --> 08:18.440]  You son of a bitch!
[08:18.440 --> 08:19.180]  I think he found the money.
[08:20.200 --> 08:20.520]  Gavin!
[08:22.080 --> 08:22.620]  Where was it?
[08:22.620 --> 08:28.740]  I found the money. And I also now have a thumbstick that's five inches when it should be ten.
[08:29.900 --> 08:35.040]  This son of a bitch rolled it into the longest thumbstick.
[08:36.060 --> 08:36.540]  What?!
[08:36.540 --> 08:45.960]  And put it all the way at the thumbstick part. There's no way for me to get this. How did you get it so deep in there?
[08:46.180 --> 08:50.100]  Maybe you can see now why I wanted you to have a frickin' camera on your thumbs, you fool!
[08:50.100 --> 08:52.640]  I didn't hear anything because it blew out.
[08:52.640 --> 08:54.680]  Now that he was so mad it all cut out.
[08:54.960 --> 08:56.300]  Can you get angry and do that again, please?
[08:56.920 --> 09:02.100]  Let me do it less angry. That's why I wanted you to have a frickin' camera on your thumbs, you fool!
[09:02.440 --> 09:05.160]  Oh, that's why you kept pushing the camera thing!
[09:06.240 --> 09:06.640]  Oh!
[09:07.960 --> 09:08.300]  God!
[09:09.100 --> 09:09.260]  Damn it!
[09:09.580 --> 09:12.140]  How long have they been in this house? Or how long has the money been there?
[09:12.660 --> 09:13.780]  Like six months, maybe?
[09:14.160 --> 09:15.180]  Oh my God!
[09:15.700 --> 09:16.220]  It's been a while.
[09:18.780 --> 09:19.580]  Six months?!
[09:19.580 --> 09:21.340]  Yeah, now you can see why I was hammering that point.
[09:22.100 --> 09:23.260]  What was... okay.
[09:23.500 --> 09:23.940]  Makes sense.
[09:24.300 --> 09:28.100]  I had to break the thumbstick to get the money out.
[09:28.600 --> 09:33.860]  What was the thought of how I was going to retrieve this while also using them the way they were intended?
[09:34.020 --> 09:35.340]  Oh, I put it up there with tweezers.
[09:36.800 --> 09:39.500]  How long of tweezers do you have?
[09:39.980 --> 09:40.780]  I got some long ones.
[09:41.080 --> 09:45.280]  It's ten inches! What are you doing with ten inch tweezers?
[09:45.280 --> 09:53.260]  Well, I only had to push them up... I probably had to push it up like six inches to get the money to touch the top.
[09:56.220 --> 09:57.100]  God damn.
[09:57.780 --> 10:00.280]  Well, I'm glad that there are other sticks coming.
[10:01.820 --> 10:03.020]  Yeah, have we talked about that yet?
[10:03.440 --> 10:04.360]  No, we haven't.
[10:04.440 --> 10:06.900]  Andrew has major complaints about my sticks.
[10:07.180 --> 10:10.580]  Oh, his sticks are the worst, Geoff. His sticks don't work.
[10:10.940 --> 10:12.560]  Really? Is it because they're full of money?
[10:13.140 --> 10:19.620]  Uh, no, it's not. It's because their shit is the reason why they don't work. Because they barely fit.
[10:19.900 --> 10:23.460]  Are you able to share a picture of the discovered cash?
[10:23.580 --> 10:24.300]  Sure, give me a second.
[10:24.360 --> 10:26.320]  Yeah, do you still have that cell phone from the 1960s?
[10:26.600 --> 10:31.060]  Yeah, you have the phone that puts a date and a time stamp on it and everything?
[10:31.240 --> 10:37.820]  Yeah, there's some tolerance issues. I printed two sets so I could also use the sticks myself in unison.
[10:38.140 --> 10:39.640]  But my sticks stay on just fine.
[10:39.640 --> 10:42.340]  I think it's something to do with the claw grip that Andrew employs.
[10:42.760 --> 10:46.740]  No, their sticks were flying off just like mine.
[10:47.120 --> 10:52.360]  As soon as we got off the base... I don't believe you. I don't believe you for a second.
[10:52.980 --> 10:59.180]  As soon as we got off the base sticks, we're on the first set, the smallest extension.
[10:59.680 --> 11:06.460]  Any time I have to move them left or right, they fly off the thing. They don't grip at all.
[11:06.900 --> 11:11.980]  I have to constantly be trying to grab and reload my sticks to move. They're a disaster.
[11:12.560 --> 11:14.920]  I gotta be honest, I think it's because of the way you grip sticks.
[11:15.180 --> 11:15.480]  I agree.
[11:15.520 --> 11:20.420]  I think Gavin's right. Because if your thumbs are on them, they're pushing it down. They're holding it in place.
[11:20.740 --> 11:23.620]  But the way you do it, you're not putting that downward pressure on anything.
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.860]  Well, I gotta be honest, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
[11:27.020 --> 11:31.560]  You've never used these, so I don't know why you're giving feedback on who's right and who's wrong.
[11:31.800 --> 11:32.720]  He's right, though.
[11:33.100 --> 11:34.040]  I'm trusting Gavin.
[11:34.600 --> 11:35.440]  He's not right.
[11:35.440 --> 11:37.720]  I've seen the way you hold a controller. It's not normal.
[11:38.980 --> 11:39.740]  He's not right.
[11:40.160 --> 11:41.320]  2024 is starting off pretty aggressive.
[11:42.840 --> 11:47.540]  Listen, Andrew's a little salty right now because you got him six months ago and he just found out.
[11:48.380 --> 11:50.380]  It's to be expected. I'd be salty, too.
[11:51.000 --> 11:57.200]  I'm salty because I wanted more Monopoly money than this. I had plans for this. This is gonna be an investment.
[11:57.840 --> 12:02.640]  Well, you were pretty set on me not nailing it or screwing it to your door, so I had to get it in.
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.280]  Well, the door would shatter, so yeah, I was pretty set on you not breaking the door.
[12:11.480 --> 12:12.380]  Congratulations, Gavin.
[12:12.580 --> 12:13.360]  The sticks are terrible.
[12:13.560 --> 12:15.760]  Yeah, that was really good. You did it.
[12:16.180 --> 12:17.120]  What happens now?
[12:18.360 --> 12:20.060]  Nothing. Disappointment.
[12:20.100 --> 12:20.900]  I don't know. I don't remember.
[12:21.780 --> 12:24.500]  Was it like a prize or punishment?
[12:24.500 --> 12:26.700]  Yeah, I think Andrew now has to run three marathons.
[12:27.220 --> 12:27.500]  Yeah.
[12:27.820 --> 12:31.440]  Or it was like, you gotta eat some gum or something? I don't know.
[12:31.440 --> 12:34.340]  I don't remember. But we both did it.
[12:34.600 --> 12:43.660]  We need, like, you know how Star Wars, LucasArts, or whatever, Lucasfilm has, like, law people? People to manage the law across the whole universe?
[12:43.980 --> 12:45.360]  Yeah, people to maintain the Bible.
[12:45.860 --> 12:52.900]  Maybe we could find a comment leaver who has a great handle on the law, and we can use them as, like, a consultant.
[12:53.740 --> 12:54.560]  A law consultant.
[12:54.560 --> 13:04.040]  Yeah. Someone who is just, like, available on Discord while we record, and we could just type questions while we're recording, just in case.
[13:05.280 --> 13:06.780]  I'm a f***ing face historian.
[13:07.140 --> 13:12.280]  If you feel like you'd be a great f***ing face historian, let us know in the comments of this somewhere.
[13:12.700 --> 13:17.220]  That's a great idea. Or email that email address. What is it? What's your email address, Andrew?
[13:19.560 --> 13:20.900]  ericsbossatgmail.com, I think?
[13:22.380 --> 13:23.780]  That's fine. That's not it.
[13:24.560 --> 13:27.620]  I thought it was, like, bits at f***facepod.com or something.
[13:27.620 --> 13:29.740]  Oh, uh, yeah. That sounds right.
[13:31.200 --> 13:33.920]  You can tell he checks it all the time.
[13:34.040 --> 13:35.260]  I haven't checked it recently.
[13:37.540 --> 13:41.240]  It's ericsbossatgmail.com or jack.patilloatroosterteeth.com.
[13:41.320 --> 13:47.500]  Do not send it. First off, Andrew gave you the wrong email address. I don't know who jacksbossatgmail.com is, but they're gonna get f***ed.
[13:48.120 --> 13:51.140]  But the one he's talking about is a so-alright email. That's a different podcast.
[13:51.140 --> 13:56.020]  Although it would be awesome if everybody who listens to f***face listens to the so-alright podcast. Thanks for the free plug, Andrew.
[13:56.400 --> 13:56.760]  You're welcome.
[13:57.220 --> 13:58.000]  Really appreciate that.
[13:58.220 --> 13:59.300]  Of course! It's a great podcast.
[13:59.300 --> 14:04.400]  So, hey, we're in 2024. We're just getting our dicks wet into the new year.
[14:05.020 --> 14:11.120]  Gavin's already f***ing got one over on Andrew. Andrew's salty about the controllers.
[14:11.380 --> 14:15.300]  We got the year of Nick's monkey mask to look forward to.
[14:15.400 --> 14:18.100]  What else is 2024 gonna...
[14:18.100 --> 14:25.140]  I have an idea for 2024 that I'm gonna do. I'm gonna float by you guys, because I think it's funny.
[14:25.500 --> 14:32.840]  I'm excited about it. You know how, like, New Year's resolutions, people are always talking about, like, I'm gonna get, like, way healthier this year.
[14:32.880 --> 14:38.380]  I'm gonna work out. I'm gonna do, like, all these, like, significant life changes. Like, that's always a big thing.
[14:38.560 --> 14:42.420]  And then you just drop off, because it's like, those are tough things to maintain.
[14:42.420 --> 14:46.800]  And you're just deciding randomly that you're now going to completely shift your schedule.
[14:46.800 --> 14:53.300]  I want to do that, but on the smallest scale I could think of.
[14:53.680 --> 14:59.020]  I want to get really jacked hands in 2024. Specifically hands.
[14:59.260 --> 15:03.620]  I want to do grip strength. You know how they have, like, those hand weights?
[15:04.020 --> 15:10.540]  I only want to do hand weights for all of 2024 and have super jacked hands by the end of the year.
[15:10.540 --> 15:15.260]  So how do we do it? Do we have to test your grip somehow? Like, measure the PSI?
[15:15.260 --> 15:20.240]  You can measure your grip. There are things that you can, like, squeeze, and it'll tell you your grip strength.
[15:20.480 --> 15:25.220]  I just like the idea of, like, having really tight handshakes as, like, I train for this.
[15:25.640 --> 15:29.740]  This is what I did this year. My hands got jacked this year.
[15:30.140 --> 15:36.140]  And then you can represent Uniform and F*** Face for all, like, networking and just be our handshake guy.
[15:36.960 --> 15:42.120]  Yeah. So I bought a set of grip strengtheners that I'm gonna start using in 2024.
[15:43.220 --> 15:46.360]  They're just on Amazon. Geoff posted, like, a link.
[15:46.400 --> 15:49.240]  Oh, it was, like, a YouTube video on how to test your grip strength if you don't have one.
[15:49.440 --> 15:51.120]  But it sounds like you've got some stuff, so...
[15:51.120 --> 15:57.680]  I do. Yes. So I'm gonna... I'm floating that out there as a F*** Face resolution with you guys.
[15:57.980 --> 16:00.020]  Getting jacked hands in 2024.
[16:00.780 --> 16:05.480]  Now, do you think if you accomplish that, you'll be able to hold the sticks on the controller?
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.100]  I might break the controller if I hit Michael's. I might squeeze too hard.
[16:10.100 --> 16:13.900]  You should jack your hands up enough. I wonder if there's, like, finger steroids.
[16:14.160 --> 16:20.360]  Where you could just get so F*** jacked that you could, like, just F*** crush a controller in your hand.
[16:20.480 --> 16:22.760]  Just, like, twist it and break it. That would be cool.
[16:23.480 --> 16:30.640]  That would be cool. Maybe, like, in Evolution, like, I have some watermelons, like, do a Gallagher thing, but with my hands, if possible.
[16:30.800 --> 16:32.440]  Do you think you could rip a phone book?
[16:33.880 --> 16:36.940]  I feel like that requires more than just hand squeeze strength.
[16:36.940 --> 16:39.860]  Yeah, it's gonna require a time machine to go back and find a phone book.
[16:40.500 --> 16:44.080]  Have you thought about becoming the giant forearm guy?
[16:44.360 --> 16:46.060]  There's a giant forearm guy?
[16:46.340 --> 16:47.460]  Oh, have you not seen this guy?
[16:47.620 --> 16:47.920]  No.
[16:48.320 --> 16:48.800]  Oh, yeah.
[16:48.940 --> 16:54.160]  Oh, dude. Yeah, massive hands and forearms. Check that out.
[16:54.160 --> 16:55.280]  He looks like Wreck-It Ralph.
[16:55.820 --> 16:59.800]  Yeah, he looks like a Pixar character. Has he done that to himself or was he born that way?
[17:00.040 --> 17:00.800]  Did that to himself.
[17:01.500 --> 17:03.920]  Did he do that? I don't know how it works.
[17:05.280 --> 17:06.860]  He's broken his finger there.
[17:07.160 --> 17:13.820]  Yeah, check out what it is when he, this is so cool, when he arm wrestles someone else.
[17:13.840 --> 17:14.360]  Oh, my God.
[17:16.760 --> 17:21.400]  He's like a character sketch for the Charger came to real life, like, if he was human.
[17:21.760 --> 17:24.960]  It looks like someone arm wrestling a beehive juggler.
[17:25.600 --> 17:30.640]  I gotta be honest, this is making me question my idea of getting jacked hands in 2024. I don't like this.
[17:31.980 --> 17:34.460]  Well, just something to think about. You could be this guy.
[17:34.800 --> 17:38.640]  I don't want to be that guy. He's got his own thing.
[17:39.220 --> 17:40.280]  Well, just do it on one hand then.
[17:40.820 --> 17:42.240]  That might be the move.
[17:42.680 --> 17:44.100]  Like in that M. Night Shyamalan movie.
[17:44.420 --> 17:45.820]  Which M. Night Shyamalan movie?
[17:46.040 --> 17:47.660]  The one where the lady was in the pool or whatever.
[17:47.860 --> 17:50.140]  One dude who had a fucking jacked-ass arm.
[17:50.540 --> 17:53.080]  Did he? Is that a subplot of that movie?
[17:53.500 --> 17:53.920]  I think so.
[17:54.200 --> 17:55.020]  What a weird film.
[17:55.100 --> 17:57.080]  Paul Giamatti was in it, I believe. He was a doctor.
[17:57.100 --> 17:57.520]  He was.
[17:58.380 --> 18:00.240]  Yeah, next to the lady in the water. That's what it's called.
[18:00.240 --> 18:00.800]  Yeah.
[18:00.920 --> 18:02.440]  I didn't see that one.
[18:02.480 --> 18:03.460]  What a strange thing.
[18:03.540 --> 18:04.740]  Okay, well maybe one hand.
[18:05.120 --> 18:08.580]  It seems like I'm alone on this pursuit and these images are not helping.
[18:08.580 --> 18:11.240]  Oh, were you looking for us to do it with you?
[18:11.360 --> 18:16.400]  That's what I was saying. I was pitching it for us that I planned on doing this and I was offering it to you.
[18:16.740 --> 18:17.520]  Yeah, I'll do it with you.
[18:17.620 --> 18:21.100]  Yeah, send me a link to whatever you bought and I'll do it.
[18:21.100 --> 18:22.740]  I'll fuck it. Why not, dude? I'll do it.
[18:23.680 --> 18:24.220]  What else am I gonna do?
[18:24.340 --> 18:29.180]  We should maybe do grip strength start of the year, grip strength end of the year.
[18:29.180 --> 18:30.300]  That's a great idea.
[18:30.760 --> 18:31.600]  And we can measure it.
[18:31.620 --> 18:37.120]  That's a great idea. Okay, I just need to buy the same equipment you have so we have parity and then we can measure.
[18:37.720 --> 18:38.640]  Get the Eric card.
[18:39.740 --> 18:40.560]  The Gracie card?
[18:41.080 --> 18:42.400]  Yeah, that's fine. Go for it.
[18:42.720 --> 18:45.180]  Well, we don't need to worry about the melting pot, so.
[18:45.440 --> 18:47.720]  Yeah, so what's the latest on the melting pot?
[18:48.020 --> 18:54.620]  No update on the melting pot. I'm still getting emails even though I've been removed, but I got invited to watch a seminar about how great it is the other day.
[18:54.860 --> 18:55.240]  Oh my god.
[18:55.240 --> 18:55.780]  Didn't watch it.
[18:55.780 --> 18:56.700]  They have seminars?
[18:57.100 --> 18:58.440]  Yeah, I missed it, unfortunately.
[18:58.440 --> 19:02.800]  I really can't believe there's a whole department of melting pot just in charge of calling people who want one.
[19:02.920 --> 19:05.340]  Like, how many people are currently inquiring about having a melting pot?
[19:05.620 --> 19:07.260]  I mean, it's probably a one person job.
[19:07.700 --> 19:08.700]  You just think it's that one guy?
[19:09.040 --> 19:17.960]  I think it's just that one dude. Or it's like a job. It's not even a job, right? It's just like whoever picks up the phone at the office that day has to deal with it.
[19:18.640 --> 19:20.260]  It's just like a responsibility they all share.
[19:20.380 --> 19:26.280]  How often can I? Honestly, how often? How many melting pots are there, first of all?
[19:27.140 --> 19:29.020]  That's a great question. How many are there?
[19:31.960 --> 19:33.340]  91 franchises, it looks like.
[19:33.480 --> 19:34.640]  That's less than I would have guessed.
[19:34.780 --> 19:40.080]  As of July 2023, in the United States and Canada, there are 91 melting pots.
[19:40.080 --> 19:51.340]  So you got to figure that even taking into consideration a couple of Andrews out there, at max, they've had 150 calls over the last however many years, right?
[19:52.360 --> 19:55.860]  It can't be enough to justify a department or a person.
[19:56.340 --> 20:00.100]  What if we get into franchising? We have other people do f*** face.
[20:00.520 --> 20:05.340]  Like localized f*** faces for different markets? Like if you want to be the Slovenian f*** face?
[20:05.440 --> 20:06.500]  F*** face for your town.
[20:06.500 --> 20:13.620]  Yeah, like the Bismarck f*** face, Boise f*** face. That's interesting.
[20:13.840 --> 20:20.140]  I thought about when I was doing the fluke face stuff, having other languages do it for like international fluke face.
[20:20.660 --> 20:23.980]  Andrew, do you want to handle all inquiries about foreign f*** face?
[20:24.260 --> 20:29.320]  No, I don't. I think since you are the most established foreigner, that should really be your department.
[20:29.800 --> 20:30.820]  I mean, you're equally foreign.
[20:31.740 --> 20:36.300]  I'd say you're more foreign than I am. I think you're definitely more foreign than I am.
[20:36.300 --> 20:43.040]  Because people are like, Canada is just second America. Nobody says England is second America.
[20:43.240 --> 20:45.620]  One of you doesn't live in their native country.
[20:45.900 --> 20:50.960]  Yeah, I was about to say one of you lives in America and has a green card and the other one doesn't.
[20:51.060 --> 20:54.040]  I'm not trying to side with Gavin too much this year.
[20:54.940 --> 20:58.080]  How would you side with Gavin on this? That doesn't make any sense.
[20:58.080 --> 20:59.980]  He's the foreigner. That makes him more of a foreigner.
[21:00.100 --> 21:04.040]  He is the foreigner. Andrew is in his native land. How is Andrew a foreigner?
[21:04.040 --> 21:06.740]  Gavin's paying taxes.
[21:07.920 --> 21:08.720]  Congratulations, Gavin.
[21:08.720 --> 21:10.420]  He's more American than Andrew is.
[21:11.480 --> 21:13.100]  I'm paying taxes. What do you mean?
[21:13.480 --> 21:14.960]  I'm paying taxes to my country.
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.760]  You know, I don't think you understand the concept of foreigner.
[21:18.580 --> 21:21.600]  I'm just saying, Gavin can't be a foreigner if he's a citizen.
[21:22.320 --> 21:23.240]  Andrew is native.
[21:24.060 --> 21:25.740]  To Canada? Well, yeah, but we're talking about America.
[21:26.060 --> 21:33.560]  Yes, to Canada. Exactly. He's Canadian. He's native to Canada. He's in Canada. He's been in Canada the whole time.
[21:34.720 --> 21:37.700]  We're an American podcast, and the center of the podcast is America.
[21:37.700 --> 21:39.300]  Wait, why are we an American podcast?
[21:39.560 --> 21:42.640]  Because it's in Deputy, Indiana. It's the center of the podcast universe.
[21:42.840 --> 21:44.280]  That's fair. We all agree on that.
[21:44.520 --> 21:49.560]  We're talking about the center of the fucking universe, and clearly the podcast happens in America. It's an American podcast.
[21:49.980 --> 21:55.500]  Gavin is more American than Andrew, so Gavin's less of a foreigner in this situation because he lives in the same fucking country that we produce it.
[21:55.780 --> 21:59.920]  So the guy born in North America is less American than the guy born in England?
[22:01.700 --> 22:04.060]  Is there a melting pot in Deputy, Indiana?
[22:06.020 --> 22:07.940]  There's nothing in Deputy, Indiana.
[22:08.680 --> 22:12.720]  You have no idea. We've been trying to get, like, there's no billboards.
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.040]  No, it's a barn, right?
[22:15.500 --> 22:19.840]  Yeah, so we are trying to get something going on a barn in Deputy, Indiana.
[22:20.080 --> 22:25.820]  I've employed a much better producer than I am to get these things going,
[22:25.820 --> 22:31.740]  and it is a process to try to figure out, oh boy.
[22:32.040 --> 22:36.880]  Do you think that this podcast is on the verge of being good, but it just isn't?
[22:38.440 --> 22:39.260]  What do you mean?
[22:39.820 --> 22:43.680]  We can't get a billboard. We wanted a billboard, we can't get one.
[22:44.000 --> 22:49.740]  Well, it doesn't exist. We can get a billboard, we just can't get one in a place that doesn't have a billboard.
[22:49.960 --> 22:52.460]  Maybe we should have narrowed it to the nearest billboard?
[22:52.460 --> 22:55.120]  Why do we pick someone without a freaking billboard?
[22:55.320 --> 22:58.040]  Because that's the math, dude. That's where it exists.
[22:58.320 --> 23:01.980]  We gotta be honest with ourselves and with geography and with the audience.
[23:02.320 --> 23:06.480]  If the nearest billboard is six miles from that spot, wouldn't we want that?
[23:07.220 --> 23:10.660]  No. We need to be in the heart of Deputy.
[23:10.660 --> 23:21.700]  I mean, the reality is, if we were informed that sometimes people rent the barn and paint signs on the barn
[23:21.700 --> 23:23.760]  and that's what they handle as a billboard in Deputy.
[23:23.960 --> 23:27.540]  If we can't work that out, then we're gonna do the next best thing,
[23:27.740 --> 23:31.840]  which is to get the billboard eight miles away or ten miles away from Deputy or whatever,
[23:31.920 --> 23:36.400]  because that's our only option. But we want to explore all the Deputy options first, I think.
[23:36.940 --> 23:38.560]  I agree with Geoff, completely.
[23:38.660 --> 23:38.880]  Okay.
[23:38.880 --> 23:40.680]  God, now I'm agreeing with Andrew.
[23:43.960 --> 23:45.520]  2024 is tumultuous.
[23:45.980 --> 23:46.840]  It is tumultuous.
[23:46.960 --> 23:50.340]  I agree with you, Gavin, 100%.
[23:51.700 --> 23:53.440]  I thought you agreed with me.
[23:54.820 --> 23:58.560]  No, I agree with Gavin that we should have thought about that.
[23:58.720 --> 23:59.060]  Oh, the billboard. I see.
[23:59.080 --> 23:59.980]  Yes, absolutely.
[24:00.540 --> 24:02.280]  But then we would be lying.
[24:03.040 --> 24:07.120]  Like all other things, it's the most difficult route, the most circuitous route,
[24:07.120 --> 24:09.980]  to get to an endgame with this fucking show.
[24:10.420 --> 24:13.180]  So you have to see things through to the bitter end.
[24:13.280 --> 24:14.520]  It's the only way things happen.
[24:15.040 --> 24:20.380]  The other day when we recorded, I suggested that I rush out the edit of the Beanhole 2,
[24:20.540 --> 24:24.600]  even though we've not put beans in it yet, because we've sold the Beanhole pens.
[24:25.020 --> 24:26.860]  And I was like, you know, I could quickly edit that.
[24:26.940 --> 24:29.980]  We could put it out and we could stick the link to the pens in the description.
[24:30.460 --> 24:34.020]  And then the video went up. No link in the video description.
[24:34.020 --> 24:36.620]  And then I said in the Slack, oh, can we put the thing in there?
[24:36.680 --> 24:38.280]  And Eric went, ooh, good idea.
[24:39.260 --> 24:43.700]  Wasn't that the whole reason I stayed up late and bent over dickwards getting that video out?
[24:44.700 --> 24:46.120]  Yeah, I thought it was good thinking, man.
[24:46.480 --> 24:47.500]  I thought that was a great idea.
[24:47.840 --> 24:49.880]  The idea was already had the week earlier.
[24:50.460 --> 24:51.740]  Yeah, exactly. It was a great idea.
[24:54.200 --> 24:55.140]  Yeah, it was good thinking.
[24:55.300 --> 24:57.000]  I don't know. I'm not sure what you don't understand.
[24:57.280 --> 24:59.020]  I thought it was a great idea. Good thinking. 100%.
[25:01.400 --> 25:03.420]  It is good thinking, Gavin.
[25:03.420 --> 25:05.920]  It is. See, that's all I'm saying. It's good thinking.
[25:06.020 --> 25:07.380]  I think we're all in agreement about that.
[25:07.580 --> 25:09.120]  Everybody thinks you think good.
[25:09.440 --> 25:11.320]  We all agree you think good.
[25:12.060 --> 25:15.060]  You know what I think maybe started my tumultuous 2024?
[25:15.640 --> 25:16.180]  The money?
[25:16.980 --> 25:19.060]  Well, no. It was before that.
[25:19.440 --> 25:27.320]  I've done something that I've never felt more psychotic in my life than going through this process.
[25:27.320 --> 25:34.500]  When we're recording this, we are a mere two days away from the big cock awards happening.
[25:34.640 --> 25:36.200]  The very exciting cock awards.
[25:36.940 --> 25:41.060]  And Geoff, I don't know if you know this. I didn't know this.
[25:41.320 --> 25:42.340]  But I'm fucked.
[25:42.740 --> 25:46.660]  However, you gave me a slight edge.
[25:47.300 --> 25:50.100]  I did? Because I forgot to nominate you. How did I give you an edge?
[25:52.380 --> 25:56.960]  First of all, did you nominate people and not nominate me for a cock award?
[25:57.480 --> 25:58.180]  No comment.
[25:59.580 --> 26:00.460]  Jesus Christ.
[26:01.200 --> 26:02.080]  That's awesome.
[26:02.080 --> 26:04.000]  Who does the nominating? Who is Geoff?
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.600]  The nominations are private. I'm not supposed to talk about it.
[26:07.960 --> 26:08.820]  Do you still nominate?
[26:09.460 --> 26:11.620]  I mean, I'm consulted. I have the opportunity.
[26:12.120 --> 26:13.560]  Who are you in charge of?
[26:14.060 --> 26:15.500]  I'm not in charge of anybody.
[26:15.700 --> 26:17.160]  That's what I'm getting to, Gavin.
[26:17.160 --> 26:20.800]  You could nominate somebody if you thought they did a great job, Gavin.
[26:21.100 --> 26:25.080]  I thought that this was all managers that were nominating people.
[26:26.160 --> 26:29.400]  I assumed that it was all decided from upper level management.
[26:29.860 --> 26:36.020]  However, I got a terrifying email saying that you can nominate someone if you want.
[26:36.320 --> 26:42.760]  Which made me realize that if this is a voting situation, I have zero chance at all.
[26:42.760 --> 26:53.460]  However, I did tilt the numbers somewhat because I both have my work email as well as johnny.caviar at roosterteeth.com.
[26:53.740 --> 26:57.580]  I got two sets of ballots that I could work with.
[26:57.660 --> 27:00.300]  So Johnny could nominate you?
[27:00.740 --> 27:02.220]  So Johnny could nominate me.
[27:02.540 --> 27:06.060]  We have to convince the whole company to nominate Johnny Caviar.
[27:06.360 --> 27:11.160]  Well, it's too late. It's already locked in. I had to panic submit these.
[27:11.160 --> 27:18.920]  So I submitted myself as both me and Johnny Caviar for every single award.
[27:19.120 --> 27:21.220]  There's a bunch of them. There's 12.
[27:21.540 --> 27:23.720]  I wrote these as Johnny Caviar.
[27:23.980 --> 27:27.940]  I realized, though, that I have several aliases on this show.
[27:28.200 --> 27:30.460]  And you can nominate up to three people.
[27:30.800 --> 27:39.800]  So as Johnny Caviar, I nominated Johnny Caviar, Raymond Somer, and Andrew Panton for every single award.
[27:39.800 --> 27:43.720]  You're going to lose because of this now.
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.780]  You fucked over whoever's making these final selections, and they're going to go,
[27:47.960 --> 27:51.160]  He just kept nominating himself under different names.
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.880]  You're going to split your own vote.
[27:54.260 --> 27:56.840]  That's absolutely 100%.
[27:56.840 --> 28:01.320]  Well, I viewed these all as votes for me, so this tells you what the award is.
[28:01.820 --> 28:03.960]  And then you have to write in a little reason why.
[28:04.080 --> 28:06.520]  And there's so many of them, I didn't go too in-depth on most of them.
[28:07.920 --> 28:08.800]  Fearless spirit?
[28:08.800 --> 28:10.920]  Yeah, that's one of the awards.
[28:12.060 --> 28:13.520]  Here's what he wrote.
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.580]  Nominating number one, Andrew Panton.
[28:15.740 --> 28:17.340]  Your reason, he's an honorable man.
[28:17.780 --> 28:20.340]  Fearless spirit, your second nominee, Johnny Caviar.
[28:20.900 --> 28:23.380]  Your reason, it's important to recognize yourself.
[28:23.900 --> 28:25.620]  Third nominee, Raymond Somer.
[28:26.100 --> 28:28.080]  Reason, a wonderful spirit.
[28:28.200 --> 28:30.280]  Wonderful spirit, that Raymond Somer.
[28:30.440 --> 28:31.260]  He's going to lose.
[28:31.520 --> 28:32.140]  Great energy.
[28:32.960 --> 28:33.600]  He's going to lose!
[28:35.280 --> 28:36.360]  Unrivaled passion.
[28:37.100 --> 28:38.400]  Definitely me.
[28:38.420 --> 28:40.480]  These categories...
[28:41.840 --> 28:43.320]  Passion personified.
[28:43.760 --> 28:46.320]  You can't top the enthusiasm of Caviar.
[28:48.020 --> 28:52.020]  Raymond Somer, his enthusiasm for content inspired me!
[28:52.880 --> 28:53.560]  As Johnny Caviar.
[28:54.170 --> 28:55.940]  Oh, so you're Johnny Caviar in that...
[28:55.940 --> 28:58.720]  This is me submitting as Johnny Caviar, yes.
[28:59.180 --> 29:02.460]  Third category, we got inclusive community.
[29:02.460 --> 29:07.000]  Andrew Panton, he maintained the communal roots even after being hired.
[29:07.760 --> 29:11.600]  Johnny Caviar, he has become a known name in our community.
[29:12.220 --> 29:16.540]  Raymond Somer, found a unique way to engage and interact with our community.
[29:17.500 --> 29:20.940]  I think all these should count as a me vote, even though they're under different names.
[29:21.100 --> 29:22.680]  Well, you should have made them all you votes.
[29:23.180 --> 29:23.840]  Well, I did.
[29:24.680 --> 29:28.120]  Yeah, I mean, Geoff's right. Just dominate yourself three times.
[29:29.360 --> 29:30.320]  Genuinely us.
[29:31.200 --> 29:34.640]  Andrew Panton, a truly original soul.
[29:35.600 --> 29:39.300]  Raymond Somer, you couldn't come up with them if you tried.
[29:39.920 --> 29:44.220]  Johnny Caviar, the most authentic person I have ever met.
[29:44.400 --> 29:46.960]  Which is weird because it is supposed to be Johnny Caviar.
[29:47.160 --> 29:49.480]  That's like a third person inclusion.
[29:50.580 --> 29:53.780]  It sounds like a review on the back of a DVD.
[29:55.060 --> 29:55.920]  It does.
[29:56.280 --> 29:57.660]  Well, there's so many different categories.
[29:58.700 --> 29:59.900]  Insatiable creativity.
[30:00.760 --> 30:05.460]  Andrew Panton, from showrunning F*** Face to Let's Play, he contributes constantly.
[30:06.260 --> 30:09.600]  Raymond Somer, some of his creative decisions...
[30:09.600 --> 30:15.820]  Some of his creative decision making have made ripples that struck the audience to the core.
[30:16.500 --> 30:21.840]  Johnny Caviar, I keep wondering when he will peak, yet all he does is hit new heights.
[30:22.020 --> 30:25.700]  I felt like a total psychopath writing all of these.
[30:25.700 --> 30:28.600]  And I had to write so many of them.
[30:29.440 --> 30:31.060]  Oh my god.
[30:31.920 --> 30:32.460]  You guys.
[30:33.520 --> 30:37.080]  Seven, check yourself, the award.
[30:37.260 --> 30:42.640]  Andrew Panton, he's an honorable man who has never not followed through with a declaration.
[30:43.800 --> 30:46.660]  Raymond Somer, hold yourself accountable.
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.520]  Johnny Caviar, the best of who we are. Truly salt of the earth.
[30:51.380 --> 30:51.580]  Okay.
[30:54.000 --> 30:56.680]  I'm just gonna post these four so I don't have to keep...
[30:56.680 --> 30:59.280]  I wanted you to win until this.
[30:59.520 --> 31:01.040]  Now I don't.
[31:01.840 --> 31:03.980]  So now we got...
[31:03.980 --> 31:08.540]  Rule together, Andrew Panton, his collaborations even here are undeniable.
[31:09.020 --> 31:11.080]  I'm f***ing three categories everything.
[31:11.680 --> 31:15.300]  Johnny Caviar, I worked alongside Andrew every step of the way.
[31:16.000 --> 31:16.940]  Rule three.
[31:18.120 --> 31:19.420]  Rule together number three.
[31:19.420 --> 31:23.640]  Raymond Somer, when working with Raymond and Andrew, I felt unified in whatever we did.
[31:23.920 --> 31:25.500]  Because I'm the same, it's all the same person.
[31:26.000 --> 31:26.480]  That's why.
[31:28.000 --> 31:29.260]  Spark, creative genius.
[31:29.340 --> 31:32.480]  Andrew Panton, working with him, I felt I was around a genius.
[31:33.180 --> 31:36.240]  Raymond Somer, one of the best creative minds I've ever seen.
[31:36.560 --> 31:40.120]  Johnny Caviar, no matter the project, he elevates it.
[31:41.640 --> 31:42.560]  Embrace change.
[31:43.180 --> 31:47.360]  His ability, Andrew Panton, his ability to change direction to support when needed is masterful.
[31:47.360 --> 31:51.320]  He operates with the intentionality and elegance of a sewing machine.
[31:51.980 --> 31:56.500]  Raymond Somer, you could argue that Raymond embraced more change than most.
[31:56.800 --> 31:59.020]  But never wavered from his core character.
[31:59.800 --> 32:03.060]  Johnny Caviar, maintains the balance of what's right.
[32:03.360 --> 32:05.920]  And I believe last late, generate joy.
[32:06.300 --> 32:08.180]  Andrew Panton, he's the best.
[32:08.520 --> 32:10.580]  Johnny Caviar, I love myself.
[32:10.920 --> 32:14.780]  Raymond Somer, makes any rumor scenario a joy to be a part of.
[32:14.780 --> 32:18.240]  So I am, I am as nominated as I can be.
[32:18.380 --> 32:22.100]  They are going to look at these and go, who wrote this, Andrew?
[32:22.220 --> 32:25.740]  Oh, okay. Uh, okay. Great. Cool.
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.120]  So Eric, did you nominate people for categories such as check yourself?
[32:30.900 --> 32:31.280]  I did.
[32:32.340 --> 32:32.560]  Huh.
[32:33.840 --> 32:34.800]  Did you, Gavin?
[32:35.260 --> 32:35.780]  No.
[32:36.360 --> 32:38.360]  Gavin wasn't aware that we could nominate.
[32:39.300 --> 32:42.920]  I also wasn't until I got this email. Shocked.
[32:42.940 --> 32:44.480]  Nick, did you nominate people?
[32:45.000 --> 32:45.480]  No.
[32:46.040 --> 32:46.920]  Nick didn't nominate.
[32:48.240 --> 32:50.140]  Geoff, did you nominate?
[32:50.340 --> 32:51.200]  Of course.
[32:51.980 --> 32:54.600]  Were there any nominations from Geoff or Eric?
[32:55.560 --> 32:58.400]  For me, Johnny Caviar, or Raymond Somer?
[32:58.400 --> 32:59.100]  I can't say that.
[32:59.100 --> 33:01.120]  No, it looks like you got these covered, man.
[33:01.320 --> 33:04.460]  Like, it really looks like you got yourself covered here, so it should be fine.
[33:04.500 --> 33:05.120]  Yeah, you got it.
[33:05.140 --> 33:06.200]  The deepest of betrayals.
[33:06.200 --> 33:08.440]  It doesn't look like you need us at all.
[33:08.500 --> 33:10.480]  The deepest of betrayals.
[33:10.480 --> 33:14.920]  A very stable man who definitely has this all worked out.
[33:15.020 --> 33:16.480]  Yeah. No, it's unhinged.
[33:17.120 --> 33:24.120]  The people who vote on the Academy Awards don't hang out on a podcast before the Academy Awards and talk about who they voted for. I can't do that.
[33:24.180 --> 33:25.600]  I think that's exactly what they do.
[33:26.060 --> 33:32.660]  Their categories are slightly more specific, like best director. Not unwavering spirit or whatever.
[33:32.700 --> 33:35.080]  No, these are rule together, classic.
[33:36.420 --> 33:41.400]  If I won the rule together award that I was telling my family, I don't know what they would think about that.
[33:42.580 --> 33:45.460]  Well, I don't think you're going to win any of these, so I wouldn't worry about it.
[33:45.460 --> 33:47.400]  It's not a conversation you're going to have to have.
[33:47.700 --> 33:49.760]  Yeah, I didn't nominate you. I'm sorry, Gavin.
[33:50.580 --> 33:53.860]  Man, you don't think I help rule together?
[33:54.520 --> 33:56.480]  I think you generate joy.
[33:58.560 --> 34:05.940]  I think you spark creative genius. I think you rule together. I think you generate joy. You definitely embrace change.
[34:06.140 --> 34:07.700]  You exemplify all of it.
[34:08.780 --> 34:16.300]  I don't know what's a bigger betrayal. You two not nominating me or Nick just not nominating anybody.
[34:16.560 --> 34:22.000]  I didn't say I didn't nominate you. I said I can't talk about it.
[34:23.160 --> 34:27.280]  You didn't. I don't know why you agreed, Nick. You already said you didn't nominate me.
[34:27.280 --> 34:28.200]  I said no, wink.
[34:30.820 --> 34:33.100]  You think you have a camera on?
[34:33.440 --> 34:34.260]  Yeah, did you hear me winking?
[34:35.680 --> 34:38.440]  And make picking the monkey mask a lot easier if you did.
[34:40.040 --> 34:43.860]  Yes, I do hear that, Nick.
[34:44.620 --> 34:49.120]  I had no chance. The cock died as soon as I saw it was a vote system, so it's over.
[34:51.300 --> 34:52.860]  You're starting the year with a dead cock?
[34:54.800 --> 34:57.960]  Yeah, maybe in 2024 it could be reborn.
[34:59.500 --> 35:00.900]  Like a phoenix cock.
[35:02.700 --> 35:08.460]  Also, Andrew, we don't know. We won't know for a couple days if you won or not.
[35:09.040 --> 35:15.480]  Oh, but we know. I didn't win. The cock dream is dead. It died on the table. It died on the ballot.
[35:15.740 --> 35:18.200]  If you're going to think like that, then you don't have a shot.
[35:19.620 --> 35:26.500]  If we viewed this as an election, my cock-a-war dreams are like the third-party candidate.
[35:26.860 --> 35:31.020]  My ballots are the 1%, if that, of the submission. I'm out.
[35:31.600 --> 35:38.080]  This would be like if it was ranked choice voting, and you voted for everybody on the ballot equally, somehow.
[35:39.860 --> 35:44.100]  You really split your vote. But it may pan out, you never know.
[35:44.220 --> 35:45.860]  It'd be funny if Johnny Caviar won an award.
[35:45.860 --> 35:49.020]  It would be hilarious if Johnny Caviar won, and I did.
[35:49.020 --> 35:50.860]  Did you do any internal campaigning?
[35:51.420 --> 35:57.160]  I tweeted at Rooster Teeth I'd be willing to bribe them to win the award, but they never got back to me.
[35:58.140 --> 35:59.960]  So the answer to your question is no.
[36:00.580 --> 36:08.300]  Well, okay, to be fair, the way my Slack account is designed, I can only interact with people that I'm in Slacks with.
[36:08.600 --> 36:13.500]  So I literally can't message people beyond you guys.
[36:13.500 --> 36:16.660]  Why didn't you start a leaflet or a pamphlet campaign?
[36:17.280 --> 36:25.360]  I did consider making my own award and sending it to all of management, but the budget and other considerations, I couldn't fit it in.
[36:25.400 --> 36:27.460]  Something to think about for 2024.
[36:27.460 --> 36:30.400]  Yeah, maybe 2024, just really up the bribery side.
[36:30.960 --> 36:37.400]  Yeah, maybe create a little flyer or something you can hand out around November or so to all the employees to be like, hey, don't forget about Andrew.
[36:37.840 --> 36:42.500]  Kind of like when you're running for school president, maybe put a poster with some glitter up and a picture of you.
[36:43.260 --> 36:45.220]  Put it up in the hallway, that kind of thing.
[36:45.460 --> 36:47.300]  Okay, I'll take notes.
[36:52.810 --> 36:56.450]  Tires matter. They're the only part of your vehicle that touches the road.

[38:07.170 --> 38:12.910]  The best way to learn a language? Immersion. Living where the language is spoken and using it every day.
[38:13.330 --> 38:18.930]  But if that's not in the cards this year, you can still learn a language the second best way, and that's with Babbel.
[38:19.750 --> 38:24.690]  Be a better you in 2024 with Babbel, the science-backed language learning app that actually works.
[38:25.230 --> 38:31.050]  Don't pay hundreds of dollars for private tutors or waste hours on apps that don't really help you speak the language.
[38:31.050 --> 38:39.530]  Babbel's quick 10-minute lessons are designed by over 150 language experts to help you start speaking a new language in as little as three weeks.
[38:40.190 --> 38:43.470]  Babbel's designed by real people for real conversations.
[38:44.190 --> 38:52.090]  Babbel's tips and tools are approachable, accessible, rooted in real-life situations, and delivered with conversation-based teaching,
[38:52.270 --> 38:55.310]  so you're ready to practice what you've learned in the real world.
[38:55.310 --> 39:01.230]  It's my favorite thing about Babbel is how convenient their courses are and how they help you learn real conversation skills.
[39:01.750 --> 39:07.610]  It's just fantastic, whether it's like learning how to order food or ask for directions, speaking to merchants,
[39:07.690 --> 39:11.670]  without having to consult language apps while on vacation, which is the worst.
[39:11.730 --> 39:14.530]  You don't want to have to pull out that app while you're vacationing somewhere.
[39:14.670 --> 39:19.590]  If you're going to a place, you want to be immersed in the culture and the scene.
[39:19.590 --> 39:25.630]  And that's what I love about it, is just being able to have those simple conversations without needing to consult those apps.
[39:26.010 --> 39:35.030]  Also, Babbel has fantastic speech recognition technology that helps you to improve your pronunciation and accent, which is incredibly important.
[39:35.970 --> 39:40.790]  Studies from Yale, Michigan State University, and others continue to prove Babbel is better.
[39:41.370 --> 39:46.510]  One study found that using Babbel for 15 hours is the equivalent of a full semester at college.
[39:47.370 --> 39:54.730]  Babbel has over 10 million subscriptions sold, plus all of Babbel's 14 language courses are backed by their 20-day money-back guarantee.

[40:19.690 --> 40:29.270]  We are in 2024, and as I reflect back on 2023, it was a really good year for me from the perspective of mental health.
[40:29.710 --> 40:35.090]  It was a year in which I really started to embrace loving myself.
[40:35.090 --> 40:46.370]  Not in like a egocentric, I'm the greatest person ever type thing, but just more learning it's okay to like yourself, I guess.
[40:46.390 --> 40:57.790]  Which I know sounds weird, but that was something I've always struggled with historically is both giving myself time and embracing the person that I am and not being embarrassed by it.
[40:57.910 --> 41:04.350]  So that's something that I've been working on a lot in 2023 and plan on continuing in 2024.
[41:06.050 --> 41:13.730]  It's something I've struggled with, but around New Year's we get obsessed with how to change ourselves instead of just expanding on what we're already doing right.
[41:14.190 --> 41:17.490]  Maybe you finally organize one part of your space and you want to tackle another.
[41:17.690 --> 41:21.990]  Maybe you're taking your supplements every morning and now you want to actually eat breakfast too.
[41:22.610 --> 41:27.690]  Therapy helps you find your strength so you can ditch the extreme resolutions and make changes that really stick.
[41:28.630 --> 41:32.490]  Therapy is something that has helped me in countless ways.
[41:32.490 --> 41:41.330]  I would not be in the place I am without the things I've learned and also just fleshing out issues that I've had in the past.
[41:42.330 --> 41:52.530]  You can give yourself all the time, but in my opinion, talking to an expert is invaluable and you will learn insights about yourself that you didn't necessarily even realize were there.
[41:53.270 --> 41:57.030]  So if you're interested in starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.
[41:57.250 --> 42:01.430]  It's entirely online, designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.

[43:39.690 --> 43:44.050]  I don't think I could ever win in a campaign system, to be honest. I don't think I've...
[43:44.050 --> 43:46.070]  You won Survive Block Island. Yeah, dude.
[43:46.070 --> 43:49.910]  Well, yeah, but that was because of other people's choices.
[43:51.150 --> 43:54.590]  What's this? Well, this is gonna also be other people's choices.
[43:54.890 --> 44:01.270]  No, but I'm saying I don't think any of the other candidates are going to be evaluated negatively based on what they did.
[44:02.090 --> 44:08.770]  Winning Survive Block Island doesn't necessarily mean the best. It just means coming across less poorly than the other people you're with.
[44:09.230 --> 44:12.030]  So you're saying I really helped you out. Yes, you did.
[44:12.730 --> 44:20.610]  Although fucking Jack, Jack is the only one who voted for you and you put a sign up that said you're next on his fucking thing.
[44:21.250 --> 44:29.570]  Didn't they cut that out? I don't know if they cut that out or not, but if not, Jack, now you know Gavin's the one that wrote the sign and put it in your house that you're next.
[44:30.290 --> 44:32.650]  Oh, man. He voted for Gavin anyway.
[44:33.210 --> 44:39.330]  Hey, can I change the subject to tell you guys about something weird that happened to me last night?
[44:39.330 --> 44:40.650]  I'd love to hear what happened.
[44:41.290 --> 44:49.730]  Well, let me start off by saying I'm an atheist. I don't know if it's painfully clear or not, but I'm an atheist and I have been for a very long time.
[44:52.130 --> 44:55.850]  Not like aggressively so or anything, but you know, that's where I am in life.
[44:56.130 --> 45:06.790]  And I've been searching for a little bit of guidance lately. I've just got some stuff in the background that I need to figure out.
[45:06.790 --> 45:14.790]  And I've got some decisions to make and I just need a little clarity and I need a little mentorship or direction right now.
[45:15.170 --> 45:16.150]  Next year's cock awards?
[45:16.530 --> 45:20.690]  Yeah, next year's awards. Next year's cock awards or beak awards, whatever the fuck they are.
[45:21.610 --> 45:26.070]  No, just some other stuff. You know, not stuff I obviously want to talk about on the podcast or I would.
[45:26.650 --> 45:32.810]  But I also have mentioned in the past, I think I told you guys about how I pray sometimes, even though I don't believe in God.
[45:32.810 --> 45:38.170]  I just feel like it's good to put that out in the universe. And I think I told you I realized I was praying to Alexa on accident because I say Alexa so much.
[45:40.170 --> 45:48.170]  So I was laying in bed last night trying to fall asleep thinking about these issues that I need to solve or figure out or that I could use some clarity on.
[45:48.670 --> 45:52.350]  And I thought, I should put this out into the universe. Who knows, you know?
[45:52.510 --> 45:56.890]  And so laying in bed last night, I prayed for guidance, just for a little bit of guidance.
[45:56.890 --> 46:04.950]  And, you know, I don't expect God to, I don't believe he exists, but if he did, I wouldn't expect him to be like, here's the answer or anything.
[46:05.150 --> 46:11.190]  But I feel like it's good to put that energy out, you know? It's just like, even if it just like subconsciously gets your mind thinking in a different way about it.
[46:11.730 --> 46:16.650]  And so I put the call out for some guidance. And then I went to sleep.
[46:17.350 --> 46:22.750]  Then I woke up this morning in a way that I haven't woken up in a very long time.
[46:23.610 --> 46:27.770]  The last time I woke up this way was in the old house when I would have ghost type stuff.
[46:28.530 --> 46:34.010]  I woke up like dead asleep to a hundred percent awake in one second.
[46:34.670 --> 46:38.350]  I don't know, guys, if that ever happens to you guys. It happens so rarely to me.
[46:38.370 --> 46:41.970]  And it's only usually like a loud clang or something and you're like, I'm up, you know?
[46:42.510 --> 46:51.110]  But I had that and I woke up and I looked around and I was a hundred percent awake.
[46:51.950 --> 46:53.870]  And I thought, that's weird.
[46:54.710 --> 46:55.910]  And then I went back to sleep.
[46:56.850 --> 46:59.910]  And then I didn't know what time it was or anything. I just like was a hundred percent awake.
[47:00.090 --> 47:01.970]  And I laid down and I tried to go back to sleep.
[47:02.050 --> 47:06.870]  And as I was laying in my bed, trying to go back to sleep, having no idea what time it was or anything.
[47:06.930 --> 47:08.970]  I didn't grab my phone or anything.
[47:09.930 --> 47:16.790]  My phone started playing the Howard Stern show on maximum volume on the Sirius XM app.
[47:17.430 --> 47:21.530]  My phone is plugged in and charging on the other side, like on my nightstand.
[47:22.310 --> 47:24.830]  I grabbed it real fast because I didn't want to wake Emily up.
[47:24.910 --> 47:26.470]  And I thought it was my alarm at first, you know?
[47:26.490 --> 47:27.990]  And I was like, oh, I must have woken up right before my alarm.
[47:28.210 --> 47:32.490]  I grabbed my phone and I hit stop and I look at it and it's 3.13 in the morning.
[47:33.790 --> 47:38.170]  I didn't have the XM app open on my phone.
[47:38.350 --> 47:40.630]  I wasn't listening to Howard Stern yesterday.
[47:40.870 --> 47:43.190]  I actually was listening to politics all day.
[47:44.010 --> 47:49.950]  So somehow in the middle of the night, my phone just opened up the Sirius XM app,
[47:50.750 --> 47:53.290]  opened up the Howard Stern channel and started playing it.
[47:53.330 --> 47:56.950]  And I also had my phone lowered because I don't need that much sound to wake up to.
[47:58.090 --> 47:59.970]  I'm a light sleeper, I can hear anything.
[48:00.370 --> 48:01.050]  And so I had it low.
[48:01.170 --> 48:07.610]  It maxed my volume up and turned the Howard Stern show on and started blaring it at 3.13 in the morning.
[48:08.930 --> 48:12.250]  And I take that as a sign, I just don't know of what.
[48:13.550 --> 48:14.710]  Because how does that happen?
[48:15.230 --> 48:19.450]  How does your phone start playing an app when it's asleep and docked?
[48:19.470 --> 48:22.910]  And sleep mode was on. I have it set up so that at 11.15 it goes into sleep mode.
[48:23.030 --> 48:29.110]  I would assume that the Sirius app updated and potentially just relaunched.
[48:29.150 --> 48:30.710]  Has that ever happened to you?
[48:31.430 --> 48:36.210]  I'm just, I thought this was lean to you telling me that Tom Cruise woke you up and you're a Scientologist now.
[48:36.830 --> 48:47.430]  No, I just don't understand what made my phone turn on the Sirius XM app and then start playing a different channel than I was playing last.
[48:47.450 --> 48:49.170]  Like the last time I played it I was listening to Dan Avery.
[48:50.050 --> 48:52.270]  But what was playing?
[48:52.970 --> 48:53.350]  Howard Stern.
[48:53.930 --> 48:55.250]  Yeah, but what was being said?
[48:55.250 --> 49:00.170]  I don't know. Howard and Robin were talking and I didn't listen to it long enough.
[49:00.410 --> 49:03.550]  I was scared it was going to wake Emily up and so I stopped it.
[49:03.550 --> 49:08.830]  I love you Geoff. You pray for a sign, right? And you think it's ridiculous.
[49:09.250 --> 49:12.770]  And then this unexplainable thing happens.
[49:13.050 --> 49:20.370]  And you get a message delivered and you immediately turn the message off and pay no attention to what was being played.
[49:20.790 --> 49:24.510]  I paid a ton of attention. In the moment I had to turn it off because I didn't want to wake Emily up.
[49:24.610 --> 49:26.890]  Like she has a 12 hour day today. The last thing I want to do.
[49:26.950 --> 49:27.350]  That's fair.
[49:27.350 --> 49:35.430]  Dude, the amount of work you go through not to wake your partner up every night of your life sticking shampoo bottles up your ass and laying backwards on bunk chairs.
[49:35.650 --> 49:35.670]  I understand.
[49:35.790 --> 49:38.110]  You completely understand where I'm coming from here.
[49:38.150 --> 49:43.810]  I get it, but if you're asking for a message and a message begins, my instinct isn't, oh that's weird, turn it off.
[49:43.810 --> 49:48.910]  I don't think the message was whatever Howard and Robin were saying. I think the message was that.
[49:49.350 --> 49:55.290]  Why would the message be SiriusXM playing Howard Stern and not what was being said on the show?
[49:55.290 --> 50:04.570]  I mean, I gotta, I gotta figure that out, but I, I think it was more of a nod to, it makes sense a little bit in my head without getting too into the weeds.
[50:04.710 --> 50:18.050]  I just think it's weird and very unexplained. And Gavin, you may have something there, but when does an app update and then change channels to a different radio station and then start playing that radio station?
[50:18.290 --> 50:20.650]  Yeah, I don't know. It might've just been like a resume thing. Like sometimes.
[50:20.650 --> 50:26.190]  But if it would've resumed, it would've resumed the Julie Mason show on POTUS. That's the last thing I heard before I closed the app.
[50:26.690 --> 50:33.190]  Like I don't know why it would open and then switch from POTUS to a different channel to Howard 100 when it was on 125 or whatever.
[50:33.430 --> 50:39.810]  Like it makes no fucking sense. And I know I didn't do it because I was already awake laying in bed trying to figure out why I was awake.
[50:39.810 --> 50:50.950]  I've had a thing where I left headphones paired and they eventually ran out of batteries and then it just, instead of pausing, just started playing stuff loud through my phone. Do you have AirPods?
[50:51.530 --> 50:56.610]  My AirPods were plugged in and charging. I plugged them in and charged them before.
[50:56.770 --> 51:04.290]  Yeah, it's certainly odd. And I can't explain it. And it sounds like whatever it was had meaning to you, which is great.
[51:04.290 --> 51:11.230]  I don't, I think it does. I just, I just, it's just, it's a little nebulous and it's going to take some time to work out.
[51:11.450 --> 51:17.990]  And, you know, I think signs are often not like super clear, you know, they kind of point you in a direction and you got to figure stuff out.
[51:18.270 --> 51:27.830]  I just, in all seriousness, I just, I'm a little, I wouldn't say creeped out by it, but it was fucking weird.
[51:28.290 --> 51:33.030]  Do you have a way of going back to that exact moment in the show and listening more clearly to the words?
[51:34.370 --> 51:44.510]  Uh, no, but it was yesterday's show. What I did do is when I woke up, I listened to all of today's show. Immediately.
[51:44.770 --> 51:48.810]  The first thing I did was turn on Howard Stern and start listening to it. And I listened to the entirety of today's show.
[51:48.970 --> 51:54.450]  And I didn't glean anything other from that. That's listening to the show made me think like it might not have been what was being said.
[51:54.510 --> 51:55.490]  It might've been the show.
[51:55.970 --> 52:00.850]  In like the 25 or so years you've been listening to that show. Have you ever called in?
[52:01.390 --> 52:02.010]  To the Howard Stern show?
[52:02.010 --> 52:02.570]  Yeah.
[52:02.870 --> 52:03.750]  No. Never.
[52:04.390 --> 52:06.030]  Maybe it's time. Maybe, uh...
[52:06.030 --> 52:08.630]  What would I say? I don't have anything to say. I just think it's weird.
[52:08.650 --> 52:10.910]  Just ask him if he has a message for you.
[52:11.530 --> 52:13.970]  Just ask Howard if he has a message for me? Yeah, maybe I'll try that.
[52:14.270 --> 52:17.010]  Just say you slept through the sign and you need to hear it again.
[52:17.270 --> 52:22.310]  Like it was, it was so weird to go from dead asleep to 100% awake instantly.
[52:22.330 --> 52:22.590]  Yeah.
[52:23.330 --> 52:28.270]  And then to be laying there in my bed and thinking, why am I awake right now? What's happened? Is it time to get up?
[52:28.270 --> 52:31.030]  Because I wake up usually before my alarm, like a minute or two before my alarm.
[52:31.290 --> 52:33.110]  And then I go, okay, my alarm will go off in a second.
[52:33.690 --> 52:39.390]  And before I even had the wherewithal to, because I have a clock on the other side of the room to look up and see if I could see what time it was.
[52:39.750 --> 52:41.210]  Howard Stern just started blasting.
[52:41.870 --> 52:44.210]  And it's just like, it's even on a wireless charger.
[52:44.430 --> 52:48.970]  Like it wasn't like even physically plugged in or anything. It's just asleep, in sleep mode on a wireless charger.
[52:49.430 --> 52:52.530]  And why would it start playing? And the volume changed.
[52:52.530 --> 52:59.090]  Like it, volume was max volume, and I set it to like 20% before I went to bed, like I do every night. I remember doing it.
[52:59.330 --> 53:01.910]  It's just like, something did that, dude. It was fucking weird.
[53:02.270 --> 53:06.110]  And it was, it was, it didn't creep me out, but it startled me.
[53:06.250 --> 53:09.330]  And it's, it's, it's got the hairs on the back of my neck standing up a little bit.
[53:09.770 --> 53:17.290]  Because I can't think of a rational, the closest rational solution would be the AirPods, but it's definitely not that.
[53:17.830 --> 53:19.570]  Because they were in their case, in charge.
[53:19.610 --> 53:20.470]  Yeah, I have no idea.
[53:20.890 --> 53:27.690]  I do, just as a concept, think it's hilarious. The idea of asking for a message, and then you receiving the message.
[53:27.770 --> 53:29.810]  Just being like, why the fuck is this playing?
[53:30.050 --> 53:31.170]  No, I was just so shocked.
[53:31.610 --> 53:34.830]  I wasn't thinking about the message at 3 in the morning. I was trying to figure out why I'm awake.
[53:35.070 --> 53:40.710]  And then I was shocked by that. And then I was trying to turn it off so it didn't disrupt my, my poor wife.
[53:40.710 --> 53:45.670]  Who's gotta, you know, work 11 hours, 12 hours today. And needs as much sleep as she can get.
[53:45.770 --> 53:49.930]  And so I was, in the moment, I was just trying, I was in crisis. I was trying to, you know, keep her asleep.
[53:50.290 --> 53:55.790]  And then laying in bed, I thought, was that my message? And then I thought to myself, like, that doesn't make any sense.
[53:55.970 --> 53:58.570]  And I was, you know, it was 3 in the morning. I was tired. I just went back to sleep.
[53:58.990 --> 54:03.850]  And figured I'd deal with it today. But maybe I was supposed to listen to that particular moment on the Howard Stern Show.
[54:03.890 --> 54:08.130]  But I think it was more that, hey, pay attention. I mean...
[54:08.690 --> 54:09.570]  It's for you to interpret.
[54:09.930 --> 54:12.230]  It's for me to interpret. And there's something to interpret there.
[54:12.230 --> 54:18.470]  I felt bad for Emily today. When she had, like, an entire business full of staff and customers.
[54:18.630 --> 54:22.710]  And then I was just screaming at the top of my lungs from the tiny room in the back.
[54:23.430 --> 54:25.250]  Yeah, I felt a little bad too. But she was sweet about it.
[54:25.510 --> 54:29.230]  I don't think she would have let us do it if it would damage things, you know?
[54:29.730 --> 54:34.150]  She's pretty serious about her career and her company and her business and everything.
[54:34.230 --> 54:38.290]  So I don't think she would have done it if she thought it would have in any way negatively impacted her salon.
[54:38.890 --> 54:40.930]  Do you think you'll listen to yesterday's show again?
[54:40.930 --> 54:41.970]  The Howard Stern Show?
[54:42.410 --> 54:42.590]  Yeah.
[54:43.010 --> 54:44.370]  Yeah, I probably will.
[54:45.570 --> 54:46.930]  I think it's worth listening to.
[54:47.610 --> 54:52.410]  But I do think that the message was that. It was wake up and pay attention.
[54:53.210 --> 55:01.490]  You know, well, it's too personal to go into, but I'm just having some stuff to figure out about my career and other stuff.
[55:01.730 --> 55:04.890]  And just my life in general. I'm almost 50 and I've got some stuff to figure out.
[55:05.370 --> 55:06.310]  So you found it relevant?
[55:06.750 --> 55:08.980]  I found it extremely relevant. I just don't exactly...
[55:09.690 --> 55:15.850]  I just haven't had time. I also, then I woke up and I started getting ready and doing work and getting Millie ready for school and stuff.
[55:15.950 --> 55:17.090]  And then I listened in the background.
[55:18.030 --> 55:22.090]  And then I had to go get my asshole waxed and then immediately record two episodes of the show.
[55:22.310 --> 55:25.770]  So I haven't had a lot of time to really sit down and...
[55:25.770 --> 55:26.890]  Not a lot of reflection time.
[55:27.390 --> 55:29.150]  Reflect on what it means.
[55:29.610 --> 55:36.150]  But it was like, it was just fucking, I don't want to say paranormal, but it was just fucking weird.
[55:36.150 --> 55:40.350]  Like, I don't know what... something did that to my phone. Something made that happen.
[55:40.410 --> 55:42.510]  Something woke me up in the way that it woke me up.
[55:42.590 --> 55:46.510]  Because it woke me up 15 seconds before that happened.
[55:47.150 --> 55:48.330]  Like, how does that make sense?
[55:49.070 --> 55:53.090]  Yeah. So I feel like the noise that wakes you up is rarely the noise you hear.
[55:53.850 --> 55:54.030]  Yes.
[55:54.630 --> 55:56.230]  So something probably fell.
[55:56.970 --> 55:59.550]  Like, did your AirPods fall and fly open or something?
[55:59.850 --> 56:01.870]  Gavin, my AirPods were in the kitchen.
[56:02.370 --> 56:05.850]  Plugged into a little device that has all my different stuff plugged into it.
[56:05.850 --> 56:10.390]  The only thing in my bedroom like that is just my phone on its wireless charging.
[56:10.930 --> 56:13.250]  Emily's got her phone on the other side on her wireless charging.
[56:13.530 --> 56:14.530]  And that's it.
[56:14.770 --> 56:17.010]  Do you think maybe Emily farted on your phone?
[56:18.650 --> 56:26.550]  Do I think Emily got up from the other side of bed, walked around to my side of the bed, farted on my phone, then walked back, got into bed...
[56:26.550 --> 56:29.430]  I don't know. I'm just trying to think of the noise that could have woken you up before that started.
[56:30.690 --> 56:33.190]  I don't... I didn't hear a noise. I just woke up.
[56:33.350 --> 56:35.470]  Usually when you hear a noise and you wake up, you hear a noise.
[56:35.470 --> 56:37.410]  I didn't hear anything. I just woke up.
[56:37.410 --> 56:39.150]  I never hear the noise that actually wakes me up.
[56:39.790 --> 56:40.390]  I feel like I do.
[56:40.910 --> 56:42.930]  Something shocks you awake and you're like, what was that?
[56:43.130 --> 56:46.230]  I didn't feel what was that. I just woke up and I was like, why am I awake?
[56:48.450 --> 56:56.510]  If you're going to wake up anyone, Emily's probably the worst person to wake up because she has that very involved routine to like get into sleep position.
[56:56.670 --> 57:01.750]  Yeah, she's got like a seven point system to get into bed. You can't fuck with that.
[57:01.750 --> 57:09.030]  No, absolutely not. And I sort of, I had a realization this, this is my last Christmas in my 20s.
[57:09.770 --> 57:19.590]  And I've somehow, I feel transitioned to older, older person excitement where like I've themed the entirety of like any Christmas thing I'm getting.
[57:19.630 --> 57:28.310]  Or if I'm going to spend money on myself as a gift to enhance my sleep because I just enjoy being really cozy and bed and relaxing.
[57:28.310 --> 57:32.590]  And so I texted Emily because I was like, I have a few ideas of how I can improve it.
[57:32.810 --> 57:41.430]  And I remember you mentioning, Geoff, her extensive routine. I texted asking like, so what, what is like the process or like I'm going through this?
[57:41.490 --> 57:45.810]  Is there anything in your routine that you think significantly contributes?
[57:46.210 --> 57:51.390]  And she sent me this massive detailed list of like every step.
[57:51.590 --> 57:55.650]  And I realized how far away I am from truly having a peak sleep game.
[57:55.650 --> 58:00.810]  I need to work on mine and I'm inching closer to that reality.
[58:01.170 --> 58:03.770]  But I realized like that is like an old man thing.
[58:03.930 --> 58:09.590]  And then I got really excited looking at shower heads of like how I can improve the shower head I have.
[58:09.670 --> 58:13.030]  And just the possibility of like, I don't really like the one that I have.
[58:13.430 --> 58:16.590]  It's kind of sucks. I could use an improvement.
[58:16.910 --> 58:17.050]  Aren't you a tub guy then?
[58:17.550 --> 58:22.370]  I am, but just like if I'm going to have a shower, because the tub is for relaxation.
[58:22.370 --> 58:24.370]  If it's like you're getting clean, you want to shower.
[58:24.370 --> 58:28.650]  I was looking at shower heads and like what the best reviewed ones were.
[58:28.830 --> 58:32.350]  And just getting excited about the optimization of the shower.
[58:32.590 --> 58:35.050]  Which is like, I wondered when that happened.
[58:35.210 --> 58:40.130]  When I transitioned to be a person that would care or be excited about shower efficiency.
[58:40.790 --> 58:42.530]  It's a weird process to go through.
[58:43.030 --> 58:45.210]  What's your current sleep routine, Andrew?
[58:45.490 --> 58:47.050]  Like, it's time for bed.
[58:47.070 --> 58:47.770]  I got the fan.
[58:48.470 --> 58:50.430]  Oh my God, I'm doing...
[58:50.430 --> 58:52.410]  Do you want to talk about psychotic moves?
[58:52.410 --> 58:54.430]  You know how I was listening to...
[58:54.430 --> 58:54.890]  What?
[58:55.930 --> 58:59.190]  You know how I was listening to the rain as like a way to fall asleep?
[58:59.810 --> 59:01.970]  I have a new sound. I have a new thing.
[59:02.370 --> 59:03.590]  I've fallen asleep...
[59:03.590 --> 59:03.710]  Piss?
[59:04.390 --> 59:04.690]  No.
[59:05.350 --> 59:06.370]  Worse, I would say.
[59:06.430 --> 59:07.350]  Because Geoff's got you covered.
[59:07.910 --> 59:09.850]  I would argue it would be weirder than Geoff's piss.
[59:10.610 --> 59:12.850]  I have been... because it's on Netflix.
[59:13.530 --> 59:14.330]  I have been falling asleep...
[59:14.330 --> 59:15.710]  It was just a failed fart.
[59:15.910 --> 59:18.050]  I wasn't recording the piss part.
[59:18.050 --> 59:19.850]  We should see if Andrew can fall asleep to it though.
[59:20.890 --> 59:22.430]  I mean, I'd be willing to try.
[59:22.730 --> 59:24.490]  Because it's better than what I have been doing.
[59:24.870 --> 59:30.550]  I've been falling asleep to the Hateful Eight every single day for the past two weeks.
[59:30.870 --> 59:32.290]  What the fuck?
[59:32.450 --> 59:33.190]  I know!
[59:34.610 --> 59:39.070]  Because it's in the snow and this is how I think my brain works.
[59:39.210 --> 59:41.590]  It's very cozy. They're in a cabin.
[59:42.090 --> 59:44.030]  I like when I'm warm and cozy.
[59:44.170 --> 59:46.390]  I like the idea of it being cold outside.
[59:46.390 --> 59:49.710]  Because I'm all comfortable and I don't have to deal with that.
[59:49.810 --> 59:51.330]  That brings me relaxation.
[59:51.870 --> 59:56.310]  So I've been playing the Hateful Eight and then falling to sleep every night.
[59:56.490 --> 59:58.270]  And I haven't made it to the cabin.
[59:58.650 --> 01:00:00.750]  I fall asleep on the way in the wagon.
[01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:04.630]  Typically around the time Walton Goggins shows up, I crash.
[01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:07.690]  And that has been... and it's the weirdest thing.
[01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:10.190]  There's no reason for it to be.
[01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:14.610]  I find the opening music to the movie relaxing, even though it's supposed to be very foreboding.
[01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:18.190]  I can't fully explain it, but it works.
[01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:23.250]  Walton Goggins doesn't have the sleepy vibe to me whenever I see him on screen.
[01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:28.310]  No, but Kurt Russell and Samuel Jackson have very calming voices, I would say.
[01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:31.670]  I've been trying to figure out what exactly has caused this.
[01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:34.710]  It started as like, oh, I haven't watched the Hateful Eight in a long time.
[01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:37.270]  I should maybe revisit that. And then I fell asleep.
[01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:41.330]  And now it's become a thing I've done in the past few weeks.
[01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:43.350]  I don't make it that far into the movie.
[01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:48.710]  Eric just posted a photo of Walton Goggins holding the gun, looking very alarmed.
[01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:49.330]  I don't get that far.
[01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:50.610]  Looks like he just got his asshole waxed.
[01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:51.590]  He does.
[01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:55.190]  But that has been my weird sleep thing.
[01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:58.890]  So if you want to send me piss, I'll take it, because I'm not thrilled about this.
[01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:01.030]  And I assume eventually it will come off Netflix.
[01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:04.310]  But at the current moment, I've been falling asleep to the Hateful Eight.
[01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:05.130]  Does it work?
[01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:08.350]  It does! It works great! That's why I keep doing it.
[01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:13.590]  But I've listened to Samuel Jackson try to get onto a wagon, like, 14 times.
[01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.730]  And it is getting repetitive, but I keep falling asleep.
[01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:17.990]  Is this playing on a phone, or do you have a TV in there?
[01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:22.630]  I put headphones into my phone, and I just fall asleep with my headphones on.
[01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:23.770]  And I pretend they're earmuffs.
[01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:25.630]  Wired or AirPods?
[01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:26.110]  Wired.
[01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.970]  Okay.
[01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.630]  That's so uncomfortable.
[01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:31.090]  I don't wake up with it wrapped around your neck.
[01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:37.710]  It does... the cord does go across the neck, which is inconvenient, but that's just how...
[01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:41.010]  Do you move a lot in your sleep, Gavin?
[01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:42.830]  Uh, yeah. Constantly.
[01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:45.410]  Well, there's always a cat standing on me, too.
[01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:46.890]  I sleep like Dracula.
[01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:52.750]  I sleep straight like a pencil with my arms folded on top of my chest, and I don't move.
[01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:58.010]  Interesting time lapse. If we all put a camera facing down and we just film a night's sleep, see who moves the most.
[01:01:58.670 --> 01:02:08.490]  So, Geoff, when your phone went off across the room, you had to, like, you sat up and went bleh, and like had to unclench your arms as they were crossed over your chest, or what?
[01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:09.830]  I think so, yeah, probably.
[01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:15.290]  I mean, it wasn't across the room. I could reach the phone from my bed, so I didn't have to get out of bed.
[01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:20.530]  If I'd had to get out of bed, if I had to get out of bed to get the phone, I probably would have just walked into the other room to figure out what the fuck was going on.
[01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:25.430]  It was the fact that, like, instantly I could just reach over and grab my phone and turn it off that, you know, I was...
[01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:28.890]  I'm still with Andrew, I think you probably should have gone in the other room to figure out what was going on.
[01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.370]  I mean, maybe, I don't know.
[01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:34.050]  I, uh...
[01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:37.790]  What's everybody's sleep routine? Gavin, what is your go-to-bed routine?
[01:02:37.790 --> 01:02:44.650]  Uh, I have an iPad that's by my bed. It's like an old... it's like a 2012 iPad.
[01:02:45.070 --> 01:02:47.110]  And, uh, I have headphones coming out of it.
[01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:55.350]  It was like a headband with headphones inside it, and I cut the headphones out, and I stick those in the pillowcase.
[01:02:55.930 --> 01:03:01.790]  So I just align my ear with one of the speakers, and I just listen to stuff and fall asleep.
[01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:03.410]  What do you listen to?
[01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:06.730]  Uh, just random YouTube, wherever YouTube takes me.
[01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:09.890]  That's bizarre. What about you, Eric?
[01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:15.270]  Uh, I lay down and close my eyes, and then it is the next day.
[01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:18.710]  I would pay so much for that ability.
[01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:20.670]  That's kind of my routine, too.
[01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:26.370]  If I could do that without just thinking endlessly for two hours, I would definitely do that.
[01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:34.290]  I used to have that problem, and then no longer have that problem, and just go to... I just close my eyes, and then I open my eyes, and it is tomorrow.
[01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:37.310]  Are you just really relaxed about your life?
[01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:51.570]  No, I think I just used to be... I think that what I thought was stress and anxiety, I thought that I had found the ceiling, and then I really found the ceiling, and then I went, I'm not even close to needing to worry about this.
[01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:54.430]  And so, after that, I just felt a lot better.
[01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:58.470]  And now I sleep... My wife has a whole routine, also, to go to bed.
[01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:02.230]  Like Emily, there are many steps. It is very involved.
[01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:05.610]  I help her when it's time for her to go to bed.
[01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:17.330]  When it is time for me to go to bed, I get into the bed, I pull the covers on top of me, I close my eyes, and then roughly eight hours later, I open my eyes, and it is time to wake up.
[01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:20.290]  That's generally how I do it, too.
[01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:27.330]  I floss and brush my teeth, put my phone down on the charger, and then get into the Dracula position.
[01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:32.270]  And sometimes, I'll kick my feet out if it's too hot, but usually I don't.
[01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:39.010]  And then I just lay down, and then I say, like, whatever little prayer or whatever, you know, affirmation thing it is, and then I immediately go to sleep.
[01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:42.730]  Quitting drinking... I had insomnia.
[01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:45.270]  You get in the Dracula position and you do a prayer?
[01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.750]  You, like, you really glossed over that. What happened?
[01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:53.670]  Well, I get in the Dracula position, I get ready, and then I just do, like, whatever nightly prayer people say or whatever.
[01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:57.450]  I usually say, like, you know, just like I did last night. You know, you put something out in the universe.
[01:04:57.770 --> 01:05:00.010]  You're the shittiest atheist in the world, by the way.
[01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:05.250]  Maybe. I mean, I'm not praying to God. I'm just praying, like, just put it out in the universe.
[01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:13.090]  I don't expect, like I said, I don't expect an answer. It's just more like, this is important to me, this is something I'm thinking about.
[01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:17.730]  If I verbalize it in my head, at least while I'm sleeping, it's rattling around.
[01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:21.290]  And then the universe tries to give you an answer, and you go, ah, I don't want to wake up Emily.
[01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:27.210]  No, I got the answer. The answer was The Howard Stern Show. I just don't exactly know what it means. But I'm working on it.
[01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:34.470]  I think that's healthy, because you're kind of, like, summing up each night. It's like a little bit of self-therapy. It's like journaling.
[01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:41.550]  Yeah, it's kind of like journaling. It's like the thing that's nagging or bothering me or that I have hopes or fears for or whatever. You just kind of, like, put it out there.
[01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:47.890]  I don't think there's anything wrong with it. Sorry. I think it's great. I just think it was weird that you glossed over it. That's all.
[01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:59.610]  When I feel sleepy, I feel like I have to... I get second wind so quickly. Like, if I don't take note of the sleepiness and if I don't act within, like, eight minutes, I'm wide awake again.
[01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:05.970]  And if I'm like, oh, I'm sleepy, head on the pillow, I'll immediately start thinking about crap, give myself second wind, and then I'm just up.
[01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:09.890]  So I have to distract myself with other content.
[01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:28.270]  I'm going to send something. I haven't shared this with you guys. When I was constructing, this is ridiculous. I know it's ridiculous, but I genuinely tried to wrap this into my sleep plans when I was doing the rain thing every night because I have a fan.
[01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:51.990]  And so I feel like I'm in the storm with the fan. And I was looking at different things that are on Halloween, and Spirit Halloween sold a, like, life-size version of the Mars attack alien, and you could fill his blaster with water, and it shoots mist out, and I was considering setting that up next to the bed so I could get mist in the face.
[01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:53.930]  Like a humidifier from Mars?
[01:06:53.930 --> 01:07:05.610]  Yeah, exactly. But I couldn't find, I was trying to find something that would spritz me in the face occasionally, and I couldn't. And that was the best solution I had uncovered.
[01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:09.290]  How would that not wake you up every time it happened?
[01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:13.570]  I don't, I don't think, I don't know, I think I would find it relaxing.
[01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:19.810]  You know how this could work. Gavin wants to watch you sleep anyway. What if Gavin watches you sleep, but then he...
[01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:22.330]  Once I've tucked you in, I could be in charge of spritzing.
[01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:23.350]  He shoots this...
[01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:24.530]  A little spray bottle every once in a while.
[01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:26.550]  Yeah, he sprays you every once in a while, whenever he thinks you need it.
[01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:35.670]  I think, if it was on the face, it would wake me up, but if it, like, was on top of my head, I don't think it would. It would just feel nice. Like some mist coming down.
[01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:40.870]  I don't know, I feel like the tiniest piece of movement or noise, I'm awake.
[01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:48.810]  Yeah, that's not how it works. Once I'm sleeping, I am out. But it's just getting comfy into sleep, is the process.
[01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:55.490]  I used to have the worst fucking insomnia, and it used to play, it's part of why I started drinking so heavily, was to drink myself to sleep.
[01:07:55.650 --> 01:08:01.510]  And then, and I was so worried about getting sober that I'd never sleep again. Turns out, the alcohol was the problem the whole time.
[01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:07.170]  I've never slept better than when I got sober, and it's never been a problem since I quit drinking.
[01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:10.670]  Never been a problem since I quit drinking. It's so wild.
[01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:14.170]  Can we try, Andrew, can I try tucking you in this year?
[01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:18.430]  Absolutely, I'd love that. You're welcome any time. Come over, tuck me in.
[01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:19.130]  When works for you.
[01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:27.130]  Any night. I'm sleeping in the same place. I will say, maybe wait a little bit. I bought myself, my big Christmas treat, bought myself a new bed, new sheets.
[01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:29.270]  We're taking this sleep game very seriously.
[01:08:29.650 --> 01:08:31.230]  And how has that affected the pillow game?
[01:08:31.830 --> 01:08:34.770]  Uh, I've added five more pillows.
[01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:38.010]  So yeah, so that 13 pillows?
[01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:41.650]  Yeah, we're gonna have a lot. The mountain grows.
[01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:46.470]  Are they all behind your head, or are you building like a fort at this point?
[01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:54.110]  Uh, well they start behind the bed, and then the bed kind of gets pushed out from the wall because the pillows leverage it.
[01:08:54.150 --> 01:08:58.610]  And so I just need to keep putting pillows in the hole, and the bed keeps sliding further out.
[01:08:58.710 --> 01:09:01.390]  So we're gonna extend that process with these five additional pillows.
[01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:06.990]  I wanna bring Gracie up to speed on a lot of previous F*** Face, because Gracie joined pretty recently.
[01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:12.250]  And for example, didn't know about the shampoo bottle that got lodged in your arsehole.
[01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:19.150]  Has Gracie listened to the Best of F*** Face compilation?
[01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:20.390]  Oh god.
[01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:21.330]  I don't think so.
[01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:21.930]  Oh no.
[01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:23.290]  Okay, I'll get you a link.
[01:09:25.570 --> 01:09:27.750]  You don't... you don't need to.
[01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:29.590]  Based on everyone's reaction, I'm really scared.
[01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:33.030]  Yeah, it's short. I'll say that. You know, it's not too long.
[01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.790]  Okay.
[01:09:34.150 --> 01:09:35.930]  I don't know that it's gonna answer any of those questions.
[01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:37.870]  But it's the best of us, so it is like it's...
[01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:39.470]  No, it'll give me more questions if anything.
[01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:40.610]  Yeah, probably.
[01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:43.050]  Ones that I don't want answers to.
[01:09:43.690 --> 01:09:47.590]  He wasn't like just like shoving shampoo bottles up his arse for fun or anything.
[01:09:47.690 --> 01:09:48.070]  It was a purpose.
[01:09:48.330 --> 01:09:57.250]  He got himself into a situation, and then he grabbed on, unintentionally shoved it up his arse, but then he had to hold that position because he didn't want to wake his partner up.
[01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.710]  It was a whole thing.
[01:09:57.710 --> 01:09:59.150]  It was a consideration move.
[01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:00.190]  It's what it was.
[01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:01.010]  Okay.
[01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:03.430]  I just searched best of f*** face, I can't even find it.
[01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:04.510]  Where is that?
[01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:06.850]  Did we not pull it out?
[01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:08.930]  I will say, we definitely did.
[01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:11.210]  Absolutely released it.
[01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:11.810]  Where is it?
[01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:13.350]  Maybe it's audio only, I don't know.
[01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:14.370]  Are you on YouTube?
[01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:15.230]  Yeah.
[01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:16.690]  Oh, I don't know then.
[01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:18.030]  That sounds like a problem.
[01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:20.370]  Oh, you have to type the asterisks.
[01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:21.390]  God, I shouldn't.
[01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:22.210]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:23.130]  You just have to...
[01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:26.050]  I literally type best of f*** face, and it's right there.
[01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:28.310]  Can we put...
[01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:29.110]  Okay, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:30.730]  I think we need to improve the tags.
[01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:33.110]  We can work on that.
[01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:34.710]  I think we need to improve the name of the podcast.
[01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:37.030]  But I guess, you know, we're just kind of like throwing ideas around.
[01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:39.450]  Is 2020 the year we change the name?
[01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:41.410]  Or 2024 the year we change the name of our podcast?
[01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:42.790]  2024 is the year we change the name for sure.
[01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:43.970]  100% on that.
[01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:50.310]  I've gone around and around on that so many f*** times over the last...
[01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:51.210]  How long have we been doing this?
[01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:51.590]  Three years?
[01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:52.190]  Goddamn.
[01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:55.850]  We should wrap this one up.
[01:10:55.890 --> 01:10:57.090]  I'm excited for 2024.
[01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:58.410]  So am I.
[01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:00.870]  Before we wrap up, I just want to say one more thing.
[01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:02.310]  I want to...
[01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:03.790]  You know, 2023, great year.
[01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:08.230]  2024, year of shattering my dreams of 2023.
[01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:10.450]  I don't know if you guys remember.
[01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:15.850]  Remember when I had the Alan Wake 2 moment where I was just going...
[01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:18.950]  And I got the code, entered it in.
[01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:20.670]  It was like a 1 in 10,000 chance.
[01:11:20.770 --> 01:11:23.130]  And I had no idea how it happened or how any of that worked.
[01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:32.030]  They just, on Tuesday, or yesterday, I guess Monday, released the New Game Plus version of Alan Wake 2.
[01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:35.210]  And so I loaded it back up and I've been playing through it.
[01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:40.190]  And I thought, I'm going to really investigate and try to figure out where the code is and how this happened.
[01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:46.290]  And so I looked at the computer and the code is on the f***ing screen.
[01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:50.070]  It's in the bottom left on a sticky note.
[01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:54.190]  Which I didn't notice until last night.
[01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:58.710]  Which now makes me think I must have subconsciously seen it and put it in.
[01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:03.670]  Completely ruining the coolest luck moment I've ever had.
[01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:06.850]  Wait, was that in the original clip that you sent us?
[01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:10.750]  I don't know. I haven't gone back and looked at the clip and zoomed in.
[01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:12.250]  I feel like we would have noticed it.
[01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:14.010]  If we all didn't notice that, that's insane.
[01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:18.150]  If we didn't notice it, then you shouldn't have been expected to.
[01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:24.670]  But I didn't. And I felt so stupid when I was like, oh, it's literally facing me.
[01:12:25.150 --> 01:12:27.550]  I'm seeing it without seeing it.
[01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:29.550]  Unless it was patched in.
[01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:31.810]  I don't think it was.
[01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:35.010]  Let me... I can quickly find the clip.
[01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.590]  Go back to your old clip.
[01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:39.630]  But that was crushing.
[01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:44.650]  Because I don't think I've ever had a cooler thing happen to me in a game.
[01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:48.070]  Okay, so I'm looking at the clip right now.
[01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:57.510]  I think when you go to click in to type in the code, it might change.
[01:12:58.510 --> 01:13:00.770]  Because it's a lot darker. The room.
[01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:03.290]  It's like pitch black.
[01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:05.290]  As opposed to that.
[01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:07.790]  Maybe it's just like a different time.
[01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:09.450]  I don't know, but you don't see it.
[01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:10.870]  The sticky note is not visible.
[01:13:12.170 --> 01:13:16.370]  Anyway, I just wanted to bring that up because I was crushed last night when I saw that.
[01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:17.550]  When I'm a fucking idiot.
[01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:19.370]  It was literally in front of my face.
[01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:25.110]  Oh, what a lovely start to 2024.
[01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:27.690]  A beautiful start to 2024.
[01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:30.830]  And next week I'm going to have my ears extra open.
[01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:32.030]  Oh.
[01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:33.890]  Yeah.
[01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:34.650]  Don't worry.
[01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:39.370]  He keeps not doing it.
[01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:42.750]  And then like putting his hand over his mouth.
[01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:43.290]  What do you mean?
[01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:51.930]  Nick, honestly, are you bummed that you didn't realize this was the first one you could do again?
[01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.650]  Yeah.
[01:13:57.810 --> 01:13:59.250]  Oh my God.
[01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:00.850]  Uh...
[01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:13.530]  Alright, well, here's to a 2024 full of asshole waxing and name changes and big sticks and all kinds of nonsense.
[01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:16.470]  I guess we should probably wrap this up.
[01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:18.070]  Eh?
[01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.970]  Eh?
[01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.950]  Should we?
[01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:23.150]  Yes, I agree.
[01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:26.750]  Because I'll keep it fucking going forever.
[01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:29.590]  Do you want me to retell the story about how I woke up at 3.13 in the morning?
[01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:31.090]  We're good.
[01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:32.050]  Cover that again?
[01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:32.790]  No, we're good.
[01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:34.010]  Universe trying to tell me something?
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.520]  I'll see you next time.
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:47.460]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.920]  Who looked at the pubes?
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.280]  We need standing desks.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:51.680]  Andrew makes an apology.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.060]  Andrew immediately deflects blame.
[01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:56.480]  Geoff finds nudity in the strangest of places.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.860]  We've got puppies.
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.400]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.320]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
