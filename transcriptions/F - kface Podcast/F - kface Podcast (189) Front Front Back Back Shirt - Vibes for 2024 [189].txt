[00:10.280 --> 00:13.940]  So you choose any cheese fondue to share, one per cooktop,
[00:14.300 --> 00:19.980]  and then you choose one salad per person, and then you can add a lobster tail if you want,
[00:20.080 --> 00:24.520]  but it looks like you can get a filet, there's ravioli...
[00:25.620 --> 00:30.080]  Do they have nacho hats that you can dip into the fondue yourself?
[00:30.960 --> 00:32.400]  Are you Homer Simpson nacho man?
[00:32.840 --> 00:37.360]  I would love that. That sounds great. Make your own nachos that are wearable? Fuck yeah.
[00:37.820 --> 00:41.160]  Yeah, I mean like this, it could be...
[00:41.160 --> 00:46.880]  Yeah, that. But you dip your head in the fountain with the hat on. Great.
[00:47.760 --> 00:53.460]  Could you imagine the crunch if NFL pads were made out of nacho chips every play?
[00:53.500 --> 00:56.960]  That would be awesome, and everyone would be hurt all the time.
[00:57.060 --> 00:57.620]  All the time.
[00:57.680 --> 01:02.380]  Constantly. Well, I mean, they have no protection in rugby. It's a step up from that.
[01:02.560 --> 01:07.140]  Right, but you hit different when you're not wearing pads. I think that your mind
[01:07.140 --> 01:08.300]  would be tricked by nachos.
[01:08.840 --> 01:12.160]  Oh, so it's like the bare knuckle argument for boxing of like,
[01:12.460 --> 01:16.100]  less damage because you're not protected. Okay, I can see that.
[01:16.940 --> 01:17.740]  Something to think about.
[01:17.940 --> 01:19.460]  It is something to think about.
[01:19.640 --> 01:19.900]  Yep.
[01:20.960 --> 01:25.820]  Just getting sacked by a guy filled with guac. It's green all over you.
[01:26.340 --> 01:27.720]  Oh, it is time for the show.
[01:28.360 --> 01:28.560]  Yeah.
[01:29.340 --> 01:30.620]  We got a lot to talk about.
[01:31.240 --> 01:34.020]  Oh, oh, we have a lot to talk about? Oh, okay.
[01:34.060 --> 01:36.160]  We haven't talked since Christmas.
[01:37.140 --> 01:38.980]  What's the limit on coffee leftovers?
[01:39.600 --> 01:40.320]  I don't know what that means.
[01:40.920 --> 01:45.660]  Hang on, hang on, hang on. Before he explains, what do you think coffee leftovers mean?
[01:45.660 --> 01:50.820]  Okay, okay. I think what he's saying is he made coffee this morning and he left it,
[01:51.020 --> 01:54.260]  and now six hours later, can you reheat it and drink it?
[01:54.500 --> 01:54.720]  Correct.
[01:54.920 --> 01:56.060]  Yes, I agree. Okay.
[01:56.160 --> 01:56.220]  No.
[01:57.180 --> 01:58.140]  Oh, I say yes.
[01:58.140 --> 01:58.480]  You think no?
[01:58.480 --> 01:58.720]  Absolutely.
[01:59.560 --> 02:01.640]  It's so bitter if it sits all day.
[02:02.680 --> 02:06.200]  You just put like a little cream and sugar in there, like reheat it,
[02:06.200 --> 02:07.280]  little cream and sugar, and you're good.
[02:08.940 --> 02:09.580]  Even worse.
[02:09.960 --> 02:12.140]  All right, good info. That's, uh, I think two...
[02:12.800 --> 02:15.900]  What was that? Oh, that wasn't two to one, that was one to one. It's a tie.
[02:16.120 --> 02:17.080]  Yeah, yeah, that's a one to one.
[02:17.100 --> 02:17.980]  That's a tie, currently.
[02:18.000 --> 02:18.280]  I need more votes, I'm afraid.
[02:18.280 --> 02:20.680]  So I guess it's all up to Andrew. Yeah, yeah, go ahead, Andrew.
[02:20.680 --> 02:21.140]  I'm indifferent.
[02:21.980 --> 02:23.580]  All right, uh, anyone else?
[02:24.720 --> 02:27.840]  It's fine. Yeah, Nick's a fucking animal. He would eat anything.
[02:28.260 --> 02:30.780]  It would be three weeks old and Nick would be like, yeah, it's fine.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.080]  Unless Gracie comes in with a swooping no, then I'm gonna drink this.
[02:34.440 --> 02:35.100]  All right, Gracie?
[02:35.680 --> 02:38.080]  I don't drink coffee, so I feel like I'm a bad judge of this.
[02:38.200 --> 02:39.900]  All right, Gracie and I.
[02:40.380 --> 02:41.900]  There we go. We're two indifference.
[02:42.200 --> 02:46.100]  It sounds like it's two to one. You should drink your old dregs.
[02:46.380 --> 02:47.860]  I mean, it's two to one to two, but...
[02:48.700 --> 02:53.100]  If you go indifferent, Nick, we will have a majority in indifference, which is great.
[02:53.340 --> 02:54.480]  Yeah, I don't care. Do what you want.
[02:54.660 --> 02:55.100]  There we go.
[02:55.420 --> 02:56.660]  One, one, three. One, one, three. There you go.
[02:59.200 --> 03:01.600]  One, one, three. What episode number is this?
[03:02.000 --> 03:02.880]  One, eight, nine.
[03:04.020 --> 03:07.740]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[03:08.280 --> 03:12.760]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and with me as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[03:12.860 --> 03:17.240]  Welcome to episode 189. I forgot to do the intro.
[03:17.760 --> 03:21.080]  I'm so happy to be here. We haven't done this in a while, so that makes sense, Geoff.
[03:21.560 --> 03:25.840]  Yeah, this is our true New Year episode, even though the one that came out after New Year
[03:25.840 --> 03:26.540]  was a while ago.
[03:26.940 --> 03:28.600]  I haven't talked to either of you since Christmas.
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.940]  How long has it been since we've done this podcast?
[03:31.560 --> 03:32.280]  December 20th.
[03:33.160 --> 03:34.380]  Was the last recording.
[03:34.880 --> 03:36.780]  It is now 15 days ago.
[03:37.240 --> 03:37.600]  Yeah.
[03:37.960 --> 03:39.400]  Oh, feels like a year to me.
[03:40.040 --> 03:42.080]  Didn't we record something together last week?
[03:42.660 --> 03:45.040]  Well, we did Let's Play stuff, but not like the podcast.
[03:45.300 --> 03:45.840]  It's a different thing.
[03:45.860 --> 03:48.200]  Oh, okay. There you go. Sorry, it's all starting to run together.
[03:48.660 --> 03:49.780]  We don't like to be too far ahead.
[03:50.440 --> 03:52.280]  Yeah, no, we definitely don't want to be too far ahead.
[03:52.980 --> 03:55.780]  How is everyone's Christmas? Everyone have a good Christmas?
[03:56.400 --> 03:56.760]  Stubbly.
[03:56.820 --> 03:58.020]  I know this is stub-
[03:58.020 --> 03:58.280]  Oh.
[04:01.640 --> 04:03.100]  Is it still stubbly?
[04:03.500 --> 04:04.520]  It's not the best.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.140]  Oh, no.
[04:07.380 --> 04:10.080]  I will say that the good days are over.
[04:11.800 --> 04:12.740]  With the old asshole.
[04:12.920 --> 04:13.800]  The salad days are long gone.
[04:14.200 --> 04:17.880]  All the benefits have gone, but a lot of the cons are still around.
[04:18.380 --> 04:21.200]  Gavin, if you're ready for round two, I can always
[04:22.560 --> 04:24.740]  contact Elyse and we can go back and do it again.
[04:24.780 --> 04:26.380]  I don't think I've got enough tuggage.
[04:26.960 --> 04:28.300]  You might have to wait a little longer.
[04:28.300 --> 04:31.220]  Really? That's an interesting question.
[04:31.380 --> 04:34.360]  What is the minimum amount needed for tuggage?
[04:34.760 --> 04:35.920]  Is there a length requirement?
[04:36.420 --> 04:37.300]  I don't think there is.
[04:37.640 --> 04:39.380]  Well, to an extent.
[04:40.920 --> 04:43.840]  I think once you're past the stubble phase, I think you could probably do it again.
[04:44.520 --> 04:44.960]  I'd assume.
[04:46.080 --> 04:49.160]  So, you got yourself stubble for Christmas, Gavin.
[04:49.240 --> 04:50.480]  What did everybody else get for Christmas?
[04:50.800 --> 04:53.400]  Geoff, you never reacted to the Christmas gift I got you.
[04:53.440 --> 04:54.100]  I'm very hurt.
[04:54.420 --> 04:55.120]  My feelings are hurt.
[04:55.120 --> 04:55.600]  Oh, you got a gift?
[04:55.600 --> 04:57.760]  I sent Geoff a Christmas gift.
[04:58.180 --> 04:59.980]  Did you send me a Popsick shirt?
[05:00.840 --> 05:02.760]  Yeah, I did. I saw it.
[05:03.060 --> 05:04.380]  I was scrolling on Twitter.
[05:04.540 --> 05:06.240]  I saw there is a sale for Geoff merch.
[05:06.320 --> 05:07.220]  Made me think of you.
[05:07.540 --> 05:09.460]  I thought, you know what? I didn't know what to get Geoff.
[05:09.820 --> 05:12.040]  He's going to definitely love one of his own shirts.
[05:12.140 --> 05:13.180]  Also on sale.
[05:14.020 --> 05:15.560]  I really appreciate it.
[05:15.620 --> 05:18.500]  I appreciate that you're a crafty and thrifty consumer.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.140]  You know me very well.
[05:22.600 --> 05:23.420]  You know what I like.
[05:23.460 --> 05:23.960]  I like me.
[05:24.100 --> 05:25.020]  I like me stuff.
[05:25.720 --> 05:26.700]  Well, it is you.
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.040]  Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
[05:28.440 --> 05:30.280]  I didn't see how that could go wrong.
[05:30.800 --> 05:34.180]  I assumed it was from you because it was from Don Zimmer.
[05:34.680 --> 05:36.440]  That's how I send stuff to you, yeah.
[05:36.540 --> 05:39.740]  Yeah, and so I just haven't had a chance to talk to you yet.
[05:39.860 --> 05:40.900]  Thank you very much, Andrew.
[05:40.960 --> 05:41.260]  You're welcome.
[05:41.460 --> 05:42.500]  It really meant a lot.
[05:42.820 --> 05:44.020]  Yeah, I'm glad.
[05:45.180 --> 05:46.580]  It was great savings for me too.
[05:46.940 --> 05:48.420]  It was all around a great gift.
[05:48.700 --> 05:49.060]  Excellent.
[05:49.600 --> 05:50.480]  You can't complain about that.
[05:50.980 --> 05:55.580]  I also sent you something else because I had a little bit of a panic recently.
[05:57.300 --> 06:04.500]  I've been deep on the adult Happy Meal train because they're giving out these collectible
[06:04.500 --> 06:05.240]  nugget buddies.
[06:05.440 --> 06:07.680]  You talking about the Kerwin Frost figures?
[06:07.920 --> 06:08.800]  I'm talking about those.
[06:08.840 --> 06:09.860]  Right there with you, buddy.
[06:10.160 --> 06:17.120]  Yeah, I didn't expect to get hooked in the way I did and now I'm stuck and it's made
[06:17.120 --> 06:21.800]  me almost consider being a blind box guy, which is terrifying because that feels like
[06:21.800 --> 06:22.960]  a very expensive hobby.
[06:22.960 --> 06:28.320]  It's also, I can't, from what the research I've done on blind boxes, I can't do it in
[06:28.320 --> 06:35.220]  a way that makes me happy because you can either, it seems, buy a blind box or buy a set that
[06:35.220 --> 06:36.440]  is all of them, guaranteed.
[06:36.900 --> 06:37.820]  And I don't want either.
[06:38.300 --> 06:41.420]  I want all of them, but I don't want to know that I'm getting all of them.
[06:41.520 --> 06:45.880]  So it's like this impossible dilemma for me for getting into this hobby, but thankfully
[06:45.880 --> 06:46.320]  I won't.
[06:46.680 --> 06:48.940]  But I've been buying nugget buddies, been trying to get them all.
[06:49.400 --> 06:52.180]  I got the gold one, which is like the rarest.
[06:52.240 --> 06:52.660]  What is that?
[06:52.660 --> 06:53.560]  What are you talking about?
[06:53.840 --> 06:57.540]  So McDonald's is doing this promotion where you can get adult happy meals, where it's
[06:57.540 --> 07:02.060]  either a 10 piece nuggets and a medium fries or a Big Mac and a medium fries.
[07:02.260 --> 07:08.080]  And it comes with a Kerwin Frost toy and it is like a collectible nugget buddy.
[07:08.460 --> 07:12.940]  And there's six of them, but there's also a Chase nugget that is like the rarest of
[07:12.940 --> 07:13.640]  the figures to get.
[07:13.860 --> 07:16.300]  So I've been trying to get a full set and I've been doing it for a while.
[07:16.460 --> 07:20.380]  And I went to McDonald's to get an adult happy meal.
[07:20.380 --> 07:21.580]  I ordered it.
[07:21.660 --> 07:22.780]  I put it in the chat.
[07:23.000 --> 07:23.580]  Oh, yeah.
[07:23.600 --> 07:24.740]  So you see you got all.
[07:25.100 --> 07:25.920]  Oh, they're great.
[07:25.980 --> 07:26.420]  Get out of here.
[07:26.620 --> 07:28.000]  Kerwin Frost has a pencil on his face.
[07:28.700 --> 07:29.100]  Perfect.
[07:30.060 --> 07:33.320]  It's also like something that once you open it, hold it in your hand, I feel like is a
[07:33.320 --> 07:34.800]  different experience than just seeing it.
[07:35.060 --> 07:35.400]  But totally.
[07:36.160 --> 07:41.700]  I went to get an adult happy meal and the store told me that the promotion was over
[07:41.700 --> 07:44.860]  and I am missing two.
[07:44.860 --> 07:51.280]  I'm missing the Kerwin one and I'm missing Darla, who has the lovely yellow earmuffs.
[07:51.280 --> 07:53.540]  How many did it take for you to get four?
[07:56.900 --> 07:57.380]  Ten.
[07:57.660 --> 07:59.300]  Let's say ten plus.
[08:00.520 --> 08:02.320]  Somewhere between ten and thirteen.
[08:02.320 --> 08:04.400]  So you've been happy mealing left and right.
[08:04.500 --> 08:06.920]  I've been happy mealing left and right.
[08:07.200 --> 08:10.060]  And can I ask, have you hacked any of those orders or just boxed down?
[08:10.060 --> 08:13.820]  No, you can only hack the morning happy meal orders for the extra hot cake.
[08:13.820 --> 08:18.520]  There's no hack in the lunch or dinner of the kid's meal selection.
[08:19.580 --> 08:24.220]  But I was told the promotion was over and I have the gold one.
[08:24.300 --> 08:28.260]  I have the rare one, but I'm just missing the two normal Chase ones.
[08:28.520 --> 08:30.580]  And so I went into a full panic.
[08:30.820 --> 08:35.520]  As soon as I got home, I checked Uber Eats to see if there were any other
[08:35.520 --> 08:37.460]  McDonald's in the area that still had it listed.
[08:37.460 --> 08:45.080]  And I ordered 15 of them just in an immediate hit to try to guarantee that I got my set.
[08:46.040 --> 08:46.980]  You're a maniac.
[08:47.460 --> 08:53.860]  The problem was I forgot that I had considered ordering two the day before.
[08:54.300 --> 08:59.580]  So I ended up ordering 17 adult nugget happy meals.
[08:59.740 --> 09:01.020]  Oh, you had cart dregs?
[09:01.400 --> 09:02.200]  I don't know what that is.
[09:02.660 --> 09:03.160]  Cart dregs.
[09:03.500 --> 09:04.960]  You left shit in your cart, yeah.
[09:05.000 --> 09:05.680]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:05.680 --> 09:06.100]  Yeah, you did.
[09:06.420 --> 09:07.000]  Yeah, I did.
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.140]  I absolutely did.
[09:08.240 --> 09:18.000]  So I got 170 nuggets sent to me and 17 of these nugget buddies.
[09:18.280 --> 09:22.820]  It took nine McDonald's bags to deliver the food.
[09:23.320 --> 09:30.540]  I got roasted by a very nice Uber driver who told me that they saw the order and thought
[09:30.540 --> 09:34.700]  it was a mistake, but then they saw the address and thought, no, that might be possible.
[09:35.240 --> 09:39.520]  Oh, and they said it in the nicest tone, but it fucking got me.
[09:43.340 --> 09:46.060]  There's only two places in the world where that's not a mistake.
[09:46.200 --> 09:47.900]  It's your house or Trump's White House.
[09:48.160 --> 09:50.060]  Yeah, he's like 17.
[09:50.280 --> 09:51.960]  That has got to be, oh, Smith Street.
[09:52.140 --> 09:52.980]  Oh, no, I know exactly.
[09:55.640 --> 09:57.820]  So I got all my nugget buddies.
[09:58.160 --> 10:02.020]  I was in a nugget hell as giving Eric updates throughout the week.
[10:02.340 --> 10:04.720]  I lived off of nuggets for eight days.
[10:04.780 --> 10:05.660]  I eventually got through them.
[10:05.660 --> 10:09.980]  But the thing about the nugget buddies, Gavin, is you don't just get a toy.
[10:10.220 --> 10:13.440]  You get a trading card with it, which I think is awesome.
[10:14.120 --> 10:17.780]  And so what I did is I put all of my nugget buddies.
[10:17.980 --> 10:18.860]  It's like I've 17.
[10:19.160 --> 10:21.400]  I want to say maybe a few other ones I just haven't opened.
[10:21.660 --> 10:26.440]  And I've mailed them all to Geoff so he can open them on the break show.
[10:26.520 --> 10:30.600]  And I can see if I get the Kerwin one I'm missing and Darla.
[10:31.220 --> 10:33.620]  And then we're going to save all the cards.
[10:33.860 --> 10:38.680]  And Geoff is going to send them to PSA to see if we could get a PSA graded 10 nugget buddy card.
[10:39.180 --> 10:42.720]  This might be taking a relatively simple thing and
[10:43.240 --> 10:46.280]  giving it the worst carbon footprint of all time.
[10:46.660 --> 10:50.420]  So let me ask you a question, Andrew.
[10:50.820 --> 10:51.360]  Yeah, of course.
[10:51.760 --> 10:53.680]  Have you already sent the nugget?
[10:53.680 --> 10:54.380]  They've already sent.
[10:54.720 --> 10:55.900]  Yeah, they've left your house.
[10:56.040 --> 10:58.000]  They've left there in the mail.
[10:58.140 --> 10:59.660]  They are heading to your address.
[10:59.660 --> 11:01.660]  Well, I'd now like to speak to the audience.
[11:01.780 --> 11:09.000]  I am in possession of 17 very rare nugget buddies that have been owned by a celebrity.
[11:09.780 --> 11:10.820]  I can't say who.
[11:11.140 --> 11:15.940]  But if anyone in the community is interested in buying one or all of these, hit me up.
[11:16.620 --> 11:22.760]  Because I just I'm flush with nugget buddies and I gotta unload these things fast.
[11:22.860 --> 11:24.940]  And if I don't, I'm gonna have to go down to a gas station,
[11:25.240 --> 11:27.400]  pop open my trunk and try to sell them like speakers.
[11:27.400 --> 11:30.280]  My boss is gonna be so mad if I come back with all these nugget buddies.
[11:32.320 --> 11:33.560]  Listen, this is a tough sell.
[11:33.640 --> 11:35.480]  Someone who's been in the McDonald's sauce market.
[11:35.640 --> 11:38.360]  It is the reselling of McDonald's specialty goods.
[11:38.740 --> 11:39.140]  Not easy.
[11:39.760 --> 11:41.380]  I am 100% kidding, Andrew.
[11:41.480 --> 11:43.760]  I'm very excited to open up your nugget buddies.
[11:44.020 --> 11:48.200]  I had a similar journey with Adult Happy Meals over the holiday.
[11:48.680 --> 11:53.480]  You know, I went from Austin to Alabama to visit my family and then from Alabama to
[11:53.480 --> 11:56.320]  Michigan to visit Emily's family and then back home.
[11:56.880 --> 12:01.180]  So I figured, what if I only eat Happy Meals in Alabama and Michigan?
[12:01.540 --> 12:04.980]  And between Alabama, Michigan and Texas, I'm bound to get the full set, right?
[12:05.060 --> 12:08.460]  It's like, it's like how truck drivers always have the unfair advantage in the Monopoly game
[12:08.460 --> 12:10.560]  because they're traveling across the country to get in different regions.
[12:10.760 --> 12:12.120]  So I figured maybe I'd get lucky.
[12:12.640 --> 12:17.480]  It only took me eight Happy Meals to get all six.
[12:17.840 --> 12:19.380]  That's fucking insane.
[12:19.520 --> 12:20.620]  I'm so mad.
[12:21.160 --> 12:23.360]  I had, Kerwin Frost was the very first one I pulled.
[12:23.820 --> 12:27.380]  The only one I don't have is the Golden Nugget, which is unfortunate,
[12:27.780 --> 12:32.700]  but I got the main six and I have a duplicate of Darla, so I will send that to you either way.
[12:33.100 --> 12:35.780]  But for the purposes of making it excited on the on the break show,
[12:36.180 --> 12:37.620]  you know, we'll try to pull it there.
[12:38.200 --> 12:38.760]  I'm excited.
[12:38.940 --> 12:40.400]  I can't wait to see this happen.
[12:40.620 --> 12:42.440]  It's probably going to be a few weeks, I imagine.
[12:42.560 --> 12:45.100]  I think I paid for eight business day shipping.
[12:45.320 --> 12:47.400]  So if not next week, you should get it the following.
[12:48.520 --> 12:54.360]  No, it was might be the fastest I've gone from what a stupid thing to touching,
[12:54.480 --> 12:55.140]  like you were saying earlier,
[12:55.220 --> 12:57.640]  to holding the Kerwin Frost action figure in my hand and going,
[12:58.360 --> 12:59.840]  I need five more of these, right?
[13:00.500 --> 13:01.220]  They're great.
[13:01.480 --> 13:02.860]  I must have all of these.
[13:03.280 --> 13:05.520]  It's for me, it's the boxing.
[13:05.740 --> 13:06.920]  The packaging is so cute.
[13:06.920 --> 13:10.560]  And I love the fact that it's wrapped in like the hamburger paper.
[13:10.860 --> 13:11.540]  That's so cute.
[13:11.760 --> 13:14.680]  Like there's so many nice little details to it.
[13:14.700 --> 13:15.940]  The trading card is great.
[13:15.940 --> 13:17.660]  It's just everything about it is awesome.
[13:17.840 --> 13:19.580]  I've been all in on these fucking nugget buddies.
[13:20.020 --> 13:22.520]  Do you think that all the protein you're getting from all this food
[13:22.520 --> 13:24.280]  has helped jack up your hands?
[13:26.100 --> 13:26.820]  I have.
[13:26.980 --> 13:28.280]  So I need to talk to Geoff about that.
[13:28.380 --> 13:31.920]  Geoff and I both bought a thing for measuring grip strength.
[13:32.300 --> 13:33.220]  Yeah, I've got one right here.
[13:33.780 --> 13:36.560]  I feel like the move is you and I do it now,
[13:36.640 --> 13:39.000]  like at the start of the year, don't tell anyone.
[13:39.740 --> 13:43.400]  And then we do, we recircle back on this in December
[13:43.400 --> 13:45.580]  and we see how much we've improved.
[13:45.580 --> 13:49.620]  And then compare it to the base standard that Eric and Gavin just naturally have.
[13:49.640 --> 13:50.620]  I think that if you...
[13:50.620 --> 13:53.580]  I think we need to send it to like an impartial observer.
[13:53.740 --> 13:56.060]  Like you need to send your grip strengths to like Gracie.
[13:56.380 --> 13:58.620]  So that way it's a recorded number somewhere.
[13:59.280 --> 14:01.600]  Just slack it to Gracie and say grip strength this.
[14:01.800 --> 14:01.920]  Oh yeah.
[14:02.180 --> 14:02.640]  And then...
[14:03.940 --> 14:04.520]  It should be in an envelope.
[14:04.760 --> 14:06.220]  Gracie can put it in an envelope.
[14:09.220 --> 14:13.420]  I can bring my grip strengther in and do it in front of Gracie.
[14:13.520 --> 14:14.380]  I don't...
[14:14.380 --> 14:15.200]  I mean, yeah.
[14:15.300 --> 14:15.440]  Okay.
[14:15.480 --> 14:16.460]  Gracie says perfect.
[14:19.380 --> 14:19.780]  Fantastic.
[14:21.580 --> 14:23.820]  I can do my grip strength in front of you.
[14:24.060 --> 14:24.460]  Perfect.
[14:28.220 --> 14:29.980]  Andrew will FaceTime.
[14:33.860 --> 14:35.680]  Well, we need everything to be above board.
[14:35.860 --> 14:36.040]  Okay.
[14:36.060 --> 14:36.800]  This is not...
[14:36.800 --> 14:38.620]  We're not going to be fucking Russia in the Olympics.
[14:38.900 --> 14:40.200]  This is going to be no cheating.
[14:40.640 --> 14:42.040]  Everything submitted properly.
[14:42.240 --> 14:44.080]  So now this is just a tester.
[14:44.080 --> 14:46.240]  After I get this, then I have to...
[14:46.960 --> 14:48.520]  Then we have to actually do the...
[14:48.520 --> 14:50.040]  Find a device to do the work.
[14:50.680 --> 14:55.140]  Can I put dog medicine on my hands to make my hands tougher?
[14:55.580 --> 14:57.860]  Oh, you want to be the dog medicine guy?
[14:58.120 --> 15:01.940]  There's a guy on TikTok I'm super into who puts dog medicine on his hands
[15:01.940 --> 15:03.860]  to make his hands tougher every day.
[15:04.400 --> 15:06.220]  And then he says, why am I doing this?
[15:06.220 --> 15:07.600]  Because I'm the guy who punches rocks.
[15:07.760 --> 15:09.060]  And then you go, oh, okay.
[15:09.420 --> 15:09.880]  And then that's...
[15:10.540 --> 15:11.260]  It makes sense.
[15:11.440 --> 15:12.280]  I think we should do that.
[15:12.280 --> 15:16.060]  Yeah, I saw a lot of that guy on New Year's Eve, thanks to Eric.
[15:17.200 --> 15:18.680]  Should we talk about New Year's Eve at some point?
[15:19.320 --> 15:19.680]  Sure.
[15:19.900 --> 15:21.060]  Yeah, let's talk about New Year's Eve.
[15:22.760 --> 15:25.700]  Yeah, we realized that we weren't doing anything for New Year's Eve,
[15:25.780 --> 15:28.960]  so we just invited Eric and his small wife
[15:28.960 --> 15:32.180]  and then Burndog and Vanessa, who basically live at our house.
[15:32.960 --> 15:33.540]  And oh, by the way...
[15:33.540 --> 15:34.600]  Yeah, I saw it there.
[15:34.800 --> 15:35.860]  I was very impressed.
[15:36.120 --> 15:36.280]  Nice.
[15:37.880 --> 15:38.740]  It was very cute.
[15:40.200 --> 15:41.180]  Fucking Nick back there.
[15:42.800 --> 15:44.600]  And then Gavin and Meg.
[15:44.720 --> 15:48.020]  And I completely forgot it was New Year's Eve until the countdown.
[15:48.480 --> 15:49.580]  I was just hanging out, watching...
[15:50.200 --> 15:51.240]  We almost missed it.
[15:51.560 --> 15:52.340]  We almost missed it.
[15:52.580 --> 15:53.880]  I felt so lame afterwards.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.240]  Emily was like, I had champagne and sparkling apple juice for you.
[15:57.400 --> 15:59.420]  And we completely forgot to pop it.
[15:59.480 --> 16:00.700]  Burndog was taking a dump.
[16:00.720 --> 16:01.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[16:03.420 --> 16:04.580]  It was in the shit.
[16:05.420 --> 16:06.920]  And we did the lamest thing.
[16:06.940 --> 16:10.300]  I've turned into one of the lamest human beings on Earth, and I don't care.
[16:10.560 --> 16:11.840]  I'm so happy with it.
[16:11.840 --> 16:18.900]  Burndog and I have been doing this thing where we sit on the sofa and we pull up YouTube and we search YouTube for cool vids.
[16:19.100 --> 16:20.240]  Just those two words.
[16:20.720 --> 16:22.860]  And then we watch everything that comes up.
[16:23.080 --> 16:28.800]  There's a giant TV in this house and cool vids was searched.
[16:29.200 --> 16:33.860]  And then you watch it and then Burndog goes, yo, have you seen this one?
[16:33.940 --> 16:36.980]  And he searches unusual memes.
[16:37.460 --> 16:40.760]  And then we're just watching videos.
[16:41.480 --> 16:46.040]  It's like watching TikTok, but it's on a giant TV and it just keeps going.
[16:46.400 --> 16:53.260]  Yeah, it's like 66% of the screen is black because it's vertical.
[16:53.520 --> 16:58.980]  And it's all just funny videos that cut like three or four frames after the event.
[16:59.020 --> 17:00.340]  It's very fast paced.
[17:00.780 --> 17:01.180]  That's fantastic.
[17:01.180 --> 17:03.680]  Yeah, it's basically like a curated TikTok.
[17:04.060 --> 17:07.520]  Anyway, before that, we've been doing two things.
[17:07.520 --> 17:11.840]  We do that and we watch home tours of houses in Grosse Pointe, Michigan.
[17:12.140 --> 17:14.880]  We just like sit for two minutes and just comment on a home tour.
[17:14.940 --> 17:15.800]  We let them autoplay.
[17:16.000 --> 17:17.600]  These are houses that sold nine years ago.
[17:17.740 --> 17:19.320]  I don't know why, but we've just gotten into that.
[17:19.400 --> 17:20.120]  It's very funny to us.
[17:20.340 --> 17:22.860]  But I couldn't bring myself to do that in front of the other guys.
[17:22.880 --> 17:24.340]  So we started searching cool vids.
[17:24.460 --> 17:28.880]  And I just kind of wanted to say, thinking about it afterwards, I'm sorry.
[17:29.120 --> 17:34.740]  I apologize for having that be the form of entertainment on New Year's Eve
[17:34.740 --> 17:37.120]  was sitting around and watching cool vids on YouTube.
[17:37.120 --> 17:38.580]  I mean, did anyone have a problem with it?
[17:38.680 --> 17:40.500]  I feel like we're all super into it.
[17:40.520 --> 17:41.500]  I did not at the time of my life.
[17:41.620 --> 17:43.620]  I just want to make sure it wasn't the last time you guys come over.
[17:43.940 --> 17:50.480]  No, no, I thought it was totally fine and just felt like I was back to being like 19 years old.
[17:52.120 --> 17:54.700]  Where it was just people going, have you seen this?
[17:54.840 --> 17:55.000]  No.
[17:55.100 --> 17:55.860]  Have you seen this?
[17:55.960 --> 17:56.180]  No.
[17:56.300 --> 17:59.300]  And then watching a bunch of videos for a long time.
[17:59.960 --> 18:06.000]  Do you think any of the turds came out of burned dog's anus in 2023, but landed in 2024?
[18:06.520 --> 18:08.020]  I think there's a really good chance.
[18:08.420 --> 18:09.860]  It's definitely possible, it sounds like.
[18:10.560 --> 18:11.900]  I think that's a really good chance.
[18:12.560 --> 18:13.620]  You can't rule it out.
[18:14.840 --> 18:15.980]  And I wouldn't want to ask.
[18:16.060 --> 18:17.800]  I want to live in a world where that's just true.
[18:19.640 --> 18:21.260]  So many fucking notes today.
[18:21.320 --> 18:22.220]  How many notes do you guys have?
[18:22.260 --> 18:23.260]  Do you guys have tons of notes?
[18:23.580 --> 18:24.140]  Like nine.
[18:24.800 --> 18:24.900]  Yeah.
[18:25.140 --> 18:26.600]  Fucking do a note, Gav.
[18:27.060 --> 18:28.340]  We'll do note turns.
[18:28.440 --> 18:28.820]  You do a note.
[18:29.300 --> 18:32.100]  The richer people are, the shittier their Christmas trees look.
[18:33.660 --> 18:34.060]  Really?
[18:34.560 --> 18:35.880]  Just an observation I've seen.
[18:36.000 --> 18:36.720]  On Instagram.
[18:37.800 --> 18:39.300]  Oh, that's an Instagram.
[18:40.000 --> 18:41.720]  There's some like yucky tat out there.
[18:41.800 --> 18:50.220]  When you've got like a 18 foot ceiling, people really fill them with just god-awful, hideous trees.
[18:51.100 --> 18:55.980]  The bigger the space, I feel like the more work is required to put into the tree, for sure.
[18:56.900 --> 18:59.640]  Because the tree has to like fit within the room.
[19:00.380 --> 19:02.380]  And then it becomes a whole... it stacks.
[19:02.500 --> 19:03.660]  The problem of it stacks.
[19:04.420 --> 19:08.100]  Growing up, my favorite toy that wasn't a toy was the salad spinner.
[19:08.560 --> 19:10.580]  Salad spinner is a great toy that isn't a toy.
[19:10.800 --> 19:14.240]  It's an amazing toy. It was better than so many of my toys.
[19:14.740 --> 19:18.840]  Yeah. And the context in which you're using it is like you're doing work,
[19:18.920 --> 19:23.560]  so then it just adds fun to where there shouldn't be fun, necessarily, as a kid.
[19:23.920 --> 19:27.080]  It feels like you're trying to start a lawnmower every time you use it.
[19:27.080 --> 19:31.880]  Yeah, like as a kid, there's nothing exciting about salad but the salad spinner.
[19:31.880 --> 19:35.520]  Just fucking slam that thing like you're trying to go back in time.
[19:35.860 --> 19:39.060]  Well, I am a bit of a salad boy, but yeah, no, I agree with you.
[19:39.120 --> 19:40.200]  The salad spinner is...
[19:40.200 --> 19:41.000]  But even as a kid?
[19:41.760 --> 19:43.520]  Were you always a salad guy?
[19:43.600 --> 19:44.720]  Yeah, here's the deal, man.
[19:44.760 --> 19:48.640]  When I was a kid, I was really into ham and olives.
[19:49.260 --> 19:49.580]  Okay.
[19:49.800 --> 19:50.200]  Ham fan.
[19:50.560 --> 19:51.260]  Big ham fan.
[19:51.460 --> 19:51.820]  He was a ham fan.
[19:52.160 --> 19:55.620]  Ham and croutons and olives were like three of my favorite foods.
[19:55.760 --> 19:57.780]  And salad was the easiest way to get those.
[19:57.980 --> 19:59.560]  So yeah, I was pretty into salads early.
[19:59.560 --> 20:02.480]  I used to pop Batman in and watch him stick to the sides.
[20:10.550 --> 20:13.190]  Gracie said I used to eat croutons from the bag as a snack.
[20:13.290 --> 20:14.150]  I still do.
[20:14.330 --> 20:14.790]  Still do.
[20:14.810 --> 20:15.190]  Not used to.
[20:15.210 --> 20:15.490]  Still do.
[20:15.610 --> 20:18.210]  Absolutely. It's a great, it's a very valid snack.
[20:18.770 --> 20:20.330]  Three days ago when I couldn't find any candy.
[20:20.610 --> 20:20.730]  Yeah.
[20:21.210 --> 20:25.830]  Yeah, it's like not necessarily... I rarely am going in for the croutons,
[20:26.130 --> 20:29.090]  but I'll open the pantry and if they're... they're there.
[20:29.450 --> 20:30.570]  You don't get like crunched out there?
[20:30.790 --> 20:31.150]  Like...
[20:31.150 --> 20:31.270]  No!
[20:31.270 --> 20:34.130]  I've eaten nine of these and now I need something that's not so crunchy.
[20:34.490 --> 20:38.090]  No, because it's typically like you're... it's... there's different flavoring on it.
[20:38.110 --> 20:39.430]  So I feel like it works.
[20:39.510 --> 20:40.950]  Like, it's not just a plain crouton.
[20:41.070 --> 20:42.630]  It's got like some parmesan on it.
[20:42.690 --> 20:44.270]  It's got butter, it's buttery.
[20:44.730 --> 20:44.750]  Yeah.
[20:45.010 --> 20:46.110]  Gracie said no, I'd eat a hundred.
[20:46.450 --> 20:48.730]  All right, so when are we doing the hundred crouton challenge?
[20:49.290 --> 20:51.530]  I can out... I will out-crouton you.
[20:51.730 --> 20:53.730]  I will out-crouton you, Gracie.
[20:53.790 --> 20:54.710]  There is no way.
[20:55.070 --> 20:56.330]  Dude, we gotta set us a challenge!
[20:56.330 --> 20:57.170]  We are gonna have a crouton off.
[20:57.650 --> 20:58.070]  I don't know why it's so competitive.
[20:58.070 --> 21:00.190]  This is the first challenge of 2024 right here.
[21:00.190 --> 21:01.550]  I'm throwing down the gauntlet, Gracie.
[21:01.870 --> 21:03.190]  Me and you, crouton.
[21:03.230 --> 21:07.490]  You pick the crouton out of the air and we'll go crazy.
[21:07.790 --> 21:10.090]  Now are you allowed to drink between...
[21:10.090 --> 21:11.190]  No, there's gotta be no liquid.
[21:11.470 --> 21:12.130]  No liquid.
[21:12.310 --> 21:13.650]  It's just straight croutons.
[21:14.070 --> 21:15.330]  No liquid, 10 minutes.
[21:15.650 --> 21:16.650]  How many croutons?
[21:16.910 --> 21:18.510]  I reckon 25 minutes.
[21:18.690 --> 21:19.830]  25 minutes.
[21:20.710 --> 21:22.250]  Someone's gonna get...
[21:22.250 --> 21:22.570]  Okay.
[21:22.750 --> 21:23.210]  I mean, whatever.
[21:23.650 --> 21:25.230]  Winner gets to take home my new puppy.
[21:25.230 --> 21:30.150]  Oh, also, we're not supposed to know the name of this dog still.
[21:30.350 --> 21:31.950]  And Geoff almost told me the name today.
[21:33.290 --> 21:35.070]  I didn't almost tell you the name.
[21:35.150 --> 21:36.330]  I almost told Gus the name.
[21:36.910 --> 21:39.970]  No, I'm in a room with Gus and Gus asked what the name was.
[21:40.390 --> 21:43.290]  And right as Geoff was about to say it, I looked at Gus and I went,
[21:43.370 --> 21:44.430]  I'm not supposed to know the name.
[21:44.670 --> 21:46.630]  And then Geoff went, I almost said it!
[21:46.990 --> 21:47.990]  I almost said it!
[21:49.830 --> 21:53.530]  Luckily, my first inclination when anybody asked me what the...
[21:53.530 --> 21:55.570]  I have a little baby pet bulldog.
[21:56.030 --> 21:57.530]  What the bulldog's name is, is Henry.
[21:57.770 --> 21:58.830]  And so I have to catch myself.
[21:58.950 --> 21:59.230]  I go, hit!
[21:59.750 --> 22:02.030]  And then it was in the uh that I caught myself.
[22:02.370 --> 22:05.390]  I tried to get the name by just constantly referring to it as a different name
[22:05.390 --> 22:08.830]  throughout New Year's Eve and seeing if Geoff and Emily looked at each other or anything.
[22:09.810 --> 22:12.510]  I probably called it 150 different things.
[22:12.670 --> 22:13.290]  I told you.
[22:13.330 --> 22:14.590]  I'll tell you when you guess it.
[22:14.710 --> 22:14.850]  Yeah.
[22:15.310 --> 22:15.770]  I'm not gonna...
[22:15.770 --> 22:17.490]  If you guess the name, I'm not gonna lie about it.
[22:17.550 --> 22:20.770]  I feel like the dog will come to you if you say the correct name.
[22:20.830 --> 22:23.430]  Like, you just gotta just keep talking to the dog.
[22:23.430 --> 22:26.910]  I don't think we got close, but we did throw out a few names where
[22:26.910 --> 22:29.290]  Geoff and Emily were like, oh, that's a way better name.
[22:29.310 --> 22:30.310]  Oh, I should have named it.
[22:30.650 --> 22:31.190]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[22:31.230 --> 22:34.210]  There were a few that were apparently just better names.
[22:34.490 --> 22:36.310]  And it's like, well, then come to us for help.
[22:36.450 --> 22:36.910]  We're here.
[22:37.090 --> 22:38.410]  Did anything get close?
[22:38.490 --> 22:38.850]  Yeah, Nick.
[22:38.970 --> 22:40.310]  There was one that was a little close.
[22:41.970 --> 22:45.170]  There was one that was in the same vein.
[22:46.550 --> 22:47.990]  Andrew, do you want to go over any of your notes?
[22:48.050 --> 22:48.790]  If not, I got a bunch.
[22:49.670 --> 22:51.790]  Uh, I could talk about what I did for New Year's.
[22:51.790 --> 22:53.590]  Because I learned something.
[22:53.870 --> 22:57.190]  Uh, you're talking about boring ass things to do on New Year's.
[22:57.270 --> 23:00.230]  I watched the movie New Year's for the first time.
[23:00.670 --> 23:01.870]  I've never seen it.
[23:02.230 --> 23:03.350]  It felt appropriate.
[23:03.990 --> 23:08.710]  Let me drop the poster in unless somebody else can beat me to doing that.
[23:09.330 --> 23:15.230]  Uh, New Year's is, I don't know if you remember in like 2009, 2010, 11-ish,
[23:15.370 --> 23:20.090]  there was a run of holiday event films that were all made by Gary Marshall.
[23:20.090 --> 23:22.530]  So he did like, Valentine's Day.
[23:22.670 --> 23:23.450]  New Year's Eve?
[23:23.650 --> 23:26.090]  Yes, it is called New Year's Eve.
[23:26.490 --> 23:27.610]  It is one of those-
[23:27.610 --> 23:28.310]  Oh, it's got Ludacris in it.
[23:28.370 --> 23:29.090]  And Hilary Swift.
[23:29.650 --> 23:30.170]  It does.
[23:30.370 --> 23:31.630]  It's one of those ensemble movies.
[23:32.150 --> 23:34.690]  But, uh, you may notice Bon Jovi is in it.
[23:35.130 --> 23:36.490]  Uh, he doesn't-
[23:36.490 --> 23:40.050]  So it's very weird where Ryan Seacrest plays Ryan Seacrest,
[23:40.190 --> 23:43.810]  but Bon Jovi plays a rock star named Jasper, I believe.
[23:44.050 --> 23:47.230]  He plays a fictional version of himself with a different name.
[23:47.230 --> 23:52.070]  But the main takeaway I had watching New Year's Eve, and it was a great lesson,
[23:52.570 --> 23:57.170]  is all of Jon Bon Jovi's scenes is with mainly Catherine Heigl, I would say.
[23:57.650 --> 24:00.730]  And Bon Jovi is one of the worst actors I've ever seen.
[24:00.990 --> 24:05.550]  But I also don't think Catherine Heigl is a great actress,
[24:06.010 --> 24:11.890]  but Measured Against the Incompetence of Bon Jovi really showed the skill
[24:11.890 --> 24:14.090]  of like what average looks like.
[24:14.090 --> 24:18.490]  It's like if you were to take the worst guy in the NBA and put him against average people,
[24:18.910 --> 24:20.330]  he would look like an all-star.
[24:20.830 --> 24:25.890]  Like, it made me appreciate what bad acting but knowing how to act is.
[24:25.970 --> 24:27.850]  Like, that's still- that is a skill.
[24:28.130 --> 24:30.050]  There's a level to that that I didn't recognize.
[24:30.050 --> 24:34.230]  It's like she's not good at it, but she showed up in the right clothes
[24:34.230 --> 24:35.410]  and is playing the right sport.
[24:35.770 --> 24:41.290]  And it feels like she's doing the thing where Bon Jovi just doesn't feel like a human at all.
[24:41.410 --> 24:42.710]  Like, it's so bad.
[24:43.370 --> 24:45.950]  And Zac Efron when he had a thinner head?
[24:46.710 --> 24:47.110]  Yes.
[24:47.710 --> 24:49.810]  Yeah, it's before all the growth hormone.
[24:50.250 --> 24:52.810]  Who is that in the beanie in the middle?
[24:54.570 --> 24:58.550]  Oh, that's the guy that cameos in all of his movies.
[24:58.770 --> 25:03.370]  He was in Pretty Woman as like the hotel guy, like the guy, the manager.
[25:04.010 --> 25:05.930]  He's not like a big actor, I would say.
[25:05.990 --> 25:08.290]  And who's that to the right of him with the hat on?
[25:08.290 --> 25:12.450]  That is a very weirdly casted Lee- or not, Lief Schreiber.
[25:12.610 --> 25:13.190]  Uh, what's his name?
[25:13.190 --> 25:14.830]  He was in Inglourious Basterds.
[25:15.410 --> 25:16.430]  Yes, him.
[25:16.870 --> 25:17.150]  Yeah.
[25:17.750 --> 25:20.490]  Yeah, he plays a character that doesn't really matter.
[25:20.570 --> 25:23.890]  But that was my New Year's Eve was watching that film,
[25:24.150 --> 25:27.070]  which is terrible, but in the way you want it to be terrible.
[25:27.390 --> 25:30.030]  And it was great to see Bon Jovi attempt to act,
[25:30.110 --> 25:34.290]  which I've never seen before and luckily don't think I will ever see again.
[25:34.370 --> 25:35.830]  He doesn't do many acting jobs.
[25:36.470 --> 25:37.250]  He was in 30 Rock.
[25:37.710 --> 25:39.970]  He was in one episode, I saw that.
[25:41.150 --> 25:43.150]  So was he- so did you like the movie, though?
[25:43.850 --> 25:46.830]  Uh, it's what you want from one of those movies, if that makes sense.
[25:46.990 --> 25:49.990]  Like if you go to a Hallmark movie, it's like it hits that.
[25:50.190 --> 25:51.170]  That's what I was looking for.
[25:51.290 --> 25:56.250]  So Robert De Niro plays a dying man who just wants to see the ball drop one last time.
[25:56.290 --> 26:00.630]  And that's a very unintentionally funny storyline where he-
[26:00.630 --> 26:05.750]  he dies watching it drop and it's supposed to be emotional, but it's just hilarious.
[26:07.770 --> 26:08.410]  He's like,
[26:09.730 --> 26:11.690]  in a wheelchair at the end.
[26:12.150 --> 26:17.270]  I can't imagine having a dying wish that is something I've done 70 times already.
[26:17.570 --> 26:22.510]  Well, that's the thing. He hasn't done it in a long time and he picked the hospital to die in
[26:22.510 --> 26:25.930]  because it had a great view from the roof of the ball dropping.
[26:26.210 --> 26:28.210]  Watching the fucking ball drop.
[26:30.450 --> 26:33.130]  I haven't had chicken noodle soup in a long time.
[26:33.830 --> 26:36.730]  I want to have chicken noodle soup one more time before I-
[26:37.630 --> 26:41.650]  It's a fucking boring, lame, uninteresting, unexciting thing to do.
[26:41.930 --> 26:44.430]  What's the origin of that thing? I never understood it.
[26:44.490 --> 26:48.030]  I thought when everyone was talking about the ball drop, I assumed something would like fall,
[26:48.330 --> 26:50.910]  but it's so slow. Like, what's the point of the damn thing?
[26:50.970 --> 26:53.850]  Dude, it is. And when I lived in Jersey, I had friends that would do it.
[26:54.150 --> 26:58.370]  You would have to get to Times Square at like five or six in the morning
[26:58.370 --> 27:02.810]  and then just fucking stand there until midnight.
[27:03.250 --> 27:06.930]  And people wear like diapers and shit because you can't go anywhere.
[27:07.130 --> 27:10.430]  You're crammed in there. There's no leaving. There's no moving.
[27:10.510 --> 27:12.210]  You give up your spot, your spot's gone.
[27:12.490 --> 27:15.170]  There's 500,000 people trying to cram in ahead of you.
[27:15.270 --> 27:17.190]  Like, when you're there, you're fucking there.
[27:17.490 --> 27:21.550]  It is a level of commitment to stand there for 60 seconds in the cold,
[27:21.870 --> 27:25.910]  smelling gross people to watch a ball fall in slow motion. I don't get it.
[27:26.070 --> 27:28.850]  Do you think it should be a signed standing? Like, by tickets?
[27:29.710 --> 27:32.410]  No, I just think people should want to participate in it less.
[27:33.510 --> 27:39.170]  It really is. I always assume that it would hit midnight and then the ball would like dramatically
[27:39.170 --> 27:42.490]  drop. Not that it slowly descends as midnight hits.
[27:42.570 --> 27:46.090]  I wanted to slam into the street like a meteor. Like explode.
[27:46.870 --> 27:53.110]  Yeah. I mean, we watched the conch drop at sloppy joes.
[27:54.170 --> 27:58.090]  We did. In the middle of cool vids, we switched over and watched a little bit of sloppy joes.
[27:59.030 --> 27:59.990]  That's fantastic.
[28:00.550 --> 28:02.890]  Also dropped slowly and not very impressively.
[28:03.310 --> 28:07.890]  Yeah, I think I'm gonna start petitioning to speed up the balls for a new year.
[28:08.450 --> 28:12.990]  Okay. Like, how long should we start counting at like five?
[28:13.570 --> 28:17.230]  Yeah, because at the moment it starts going at like 40 seconds left.
[28:17.670 --> 28:19.370]  Yeah. Or 20 seconds left, maybe.
[28:19.470 --> 28:26.130]  What if the ball was going up as the time went down and then when it hit zero,
[28:26.130 --> 28:29.110]  it went from the top and slammed back down?
[28:29.490 --> 28:30.430]  That would be awesome.
[28:31.490 --> 28:34.370]  That's like that Dr. Doom ride at Universal Studios.
[28:34.970 --> 28:36.130]  Exactly. Yeah.
[28:36.230 --> 28:37.310]  Yeah, I like that.
[28:37.590 --> 28:39.750]  Maybe like Thor's hammer slamming into the ground.
[28:40.930 --> 28:46.550]  I have one other note that I could transition to that I think you're gonna love, Geoff,
[28:46.910 --> 28:52.730]  especially. This is something we haven't talked about. Gavin and I were discussing shirts the
[28:52.730 --> 28:53.030]  other day.
[28:53.030 --> 28:54.490]  Oh, I saw the prototype.
[28:55.710 --> 29:01.270]  And I asked Gavin... Gavin hasn't seen it yet. I said to Gavin,
[29:01.630 --> 29:07.430]  why do shirts have fronts and backs? Like, what is... there has to be a reason for a shirt to
[29:07.430 --> 29:12.050]  have a back, but I feel like whenever I'm putting a shirt on, I always put it on backwards and then
[29:12.050 --> 29:16.170]  I have to spin it around and it's just an annoyance. It's sort of like the whole your
[29:16.170 --> 29:20.490]  left sock thing, Geoff. Every time my shirt is on backwards.
[29:20.490 --> 29:25.370]  So my response was like, surely it needs a back to have a spot for the label or the
[29:26.090 --> 29:28.430]  information. And then I was like, wait, why does it need information?
[29:29.030 --> 29:32.830]  Yeah, you're like, could it be on the side? Is it allowed to be on the side of the shirt?
[29:32.970 --> 29:38.590]  What are the laws of the shirt tag? So I went to Tony, who knows a lot more about,
[29:38.810 --> 29:44.030]  I mean, everything, I guess, than we do. And I asked him and he gave me a bunch of reasons,
[29:44.050 --> 29:50.030]  but he also didn't definitively know. And so he brought it up to Ari, who is like the lead
[29:50.030 --> 29:56.130]  designer for merch. And he was captivated by this idea. And he was like, I had other plans.
[29:56.290 --> 30:01.110]  I'm going home right now to sew shirts together and see what this is about, to see what will
[30:01.110 --> 30:06.670]  happen if you do this. And so I'm going to put photos in right now of the shirts that he made.
[30:06.950 --> 30:13.050]  This is a double front shirt. So this is from the front. Looks totally normal.
[30:13.370 --> 30:19.790]  Looks like your standard front of shirt. But then you got a side profile. And best of all,
[30:19.790 --> 30:26.870]  here is the front back of the shirt that you can see. Double fronts.
[30:27.250 --> 30:32.390]  So this isn't that old front back shirt that made a while back. This is a front front shirt.
[30:32.710 --> 30:39.670]  This is an all fronts shirt. No back. But in the process of doing that, he had the
[30:39.670 --> 30:46.790]  realization that he could also make an all back shirt. So these are the backs of the front shirt.
[30:46.790 --> 30:52.630]  These are two backs sewed together. Backpack shirt is so insane.
[30:53.470 --> 30:57.550]  You got a double backpack shirt. Why does the backpack look so weird?
[30:58.770 --> 31:03.930]  Because the back is higher. The back's higher than the front. So you got two high spots.
[31:04.770 --> 31:09.530]  I'm not a fan of the backpack shirt at all. Oh, I love the back. I love the back.
[31:10.050 --> 31:14.790]  Dude, front, front, front, whatever. I think front front is a cool, funny idea.
[31:15.550 --> 31:22.850]  Backpack? Insane. All about the backpack shirt. Well, we need to further innovate in this because
[31:22.850 --> 31:27.330]  Tony brought up the idea of having it double sided, double front, double sided, double back.
[31:27.770 --> 31:35.490]  So inside out, either direction is appropriate to wear. Zero direction needed. Could you have
[31:35.490 --> 31:41.970]  it so that the fronts were on the outside and the backpack was on the inside and you could
[31:41.970 --> 31:48.470]  Oh, you could flip it inside out and have the backpack. How would you do that, though? Because
[31:48.470 --> 31:54.650]  the neckline on the backpack is different. Yeah. So I think you would have you could have one shirt
[31:54.650 --> 32:02.730]  that no matter how you put it on is always right or you turn it inside out and no matter how you
[32:02.730 --> 32:10.910]  put it on, it's always wrong. Yeah. Well, yeah, I think the real winner here is the reversible front
[32:10.910 --> 32:18.830]  so you have four fronts. If you're really fucking dirty, you can wear that shirt four days in a row
[32:18.830 --> 32:25.430]  in the front of it's clean four times. Think about all the laundry you'll save. This is going to be an
[32:25.430 --> 32:30.390]  expensive shirt, but the value is going to be tremendous. You're buying four shirts. Yeah.
[32:31.530 --> 32:36.870]  There's got to be a way to figure out how to make it when you switch it, it becomes two backs,
[32:36.870 --> 32:42.850]  maybe like the inside neckline can fold up tracks. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I'm sure Tony
[32:42.850 --> 32:50.150]  will hear this and experiment further. This is like having Ari do this is so fucking fun. This
[32:50.150 --> 32:57.830]  is like he's so talented and he's like jacked and does jujitsu and climbs mountains and like
[32:57.830 --> 33:04.510]  is an artist and has a degree. And then you went, what if shirt has two fronts? And he went,
[33:04.510 --> 33:10.010]  I'm on it. And you know what? He climbed front front mountain. And when he was at the top of
[33:10.010 --> 33:15.030]  front front mountain, he found backpack mountain. He, he didn't just find front front mountain.
[33:15.350 --> 33:20.210]  He came up with what I think is such a funny idea. And I don't know if this is possible. He
[33:20.210 --> 33:24.330]  doesn't know. I don't think we need to further experiment. He brought up doing a front front
[33:24.330 --> 33:32.270]  back back hoodie. So you'd have to, you'd have a front pouch and a back pouch or you would have
[33:32.270 --> 33:42.450]  double hoods, a front hood and a back hood. And I think that's such a funny idea. And I don't,
[33:42.730 --> 33:48.170]  we don't know if that's a possibility yet, but I fucking hope it can be done. Cause if you want to
[33:48.170 --> 33:55.610]  take a nap in the airport, you just put up your front hood and then put the back up. Lock your
[33:55.610 --> 34:01.810]  face in just the idea of two pouches. It's all, it looks so stupid in my head that I really hope
[34:02.370 --> 34:05.410]  there's no limits to this. Like, you know how some people turn their hat,
[34:05.530 --> 34:10.230]  their baseball caps backwards. Yeah. Have one on both sides. Or a quad bill.
[34:10.510 --> 34:17.410]  A quad bill would just be like a big sun hat. You could have four different, you could have
[34:17.410 --> 34:22.430]  four different sports in one hat. You could have different teams. You could rotate. Yeah.
[34:22.710 --> 34:27.230]  You could be like, if you're LA, you could have like the Dodgers, the Lakers, the fucking Rams
[34:27.230 --> 34:31.290]  and the Clippers. And you just spin on which game you're going to. It sounds like we have
[34:31.290 --> 34:39.690]  a whole clothing line to release of multiple angles. If we're doing quad brim, I've only seen
[34:39.690 --> 34:46.050]  Yankee's hat no brim. So I'm so excited about what a quad brim hat could bring us in the future.
[34:46.570 --> 34:53.130]  This is, Oh, I'm thrilled. This is, I just don't know if this can extend to pants. It feels like
[34:53.130 --> 34:58.830]  the front and the back of pants are so close, but I'm excited to see where we can go and where we
[34:58.830 --> 35:02.710]  can take this. You know what I mean? This is great. Yeah, for sure. Big time. Yeah.
[35:03.190 --> 35:06.470]  We're making some advancements in clothing, especially with this beanie we've got now.
[35:06.670 --> 35:12.990]  We really are. And we, uh, I think since we recorded last week, no, no, we had already filmed
[35:12.990 --> 35:17.650]  the season two of Does It Do before. Yeah, but I don't know if we've talked about it. It comes out
[35:17.650 --> 35:25.890]  on the 29th of January. Holy shit. And because Shady Ray's sponsored it. Shady Ray said, do more
[35:25.890 --> 35:32.350]  Does It Do please? And they paid for it. So you get it for free. Insane. It'll be on the face
[35:32.350 --> 35:38.030]  channel. It'll go out on Mondays. I think, um, we actually had a little preview. We watched one on
[35:38.030 --> 35:41.690]  New Year's Eve, just cause I was telling Geoff, I thought it was funny. I was proofing it. And then
[35:41.690 --> 35:46.210]  we all just watched it. And, uh, it's a real ridiculous one. The one we watched was, was, uh,
[35:46.210 --> 35:51.970]  about topic. That's, uh, that's another one that, uh, that another one of those moments where I
[35:51.970 --> 35:55.930]  thought about after, and I thought, you idiot, did you really just have a bunch of people over
[35:55.930 --> 36:00.350]  and then make them watch your funny video? And then I was like, we all work together. I guess
[36:00.350 --> 36:06.490]  it's not. Yeah, we all know what's going on. Yeah. I felt dumb after that. Uh, well, I just
[36:06.490 --> 36:10.890]  gotta say it's just for further proof that, that the innovations that we're discovering in Does
[36:10.890 --> 36:15.350]  It Do are being applied in the real world through f***ing facing uniform, uniform, combining the
[36:15.350 --> 36:19.250]  power of one with the fabric of the form uniform. And, uh, it's just great to see it. It's great to
[36:19.250 --> 36:24.070]  see the fruits of all these labors as we, as we grow, you know, as fantastic.

[38:01.220 --> 38:08.640]  I can't believe I'm about to do this but here is the ad for Cosmic Crisp apples. Get to know
[38:08.640 --> 38:15.040]  our favorite regulation apple, the Cosmic Crisp. If you know, you know. It is a classically bred
[38:15.040 --> 38:21.640]  cross of the Honeycrisp and Enterprise varieties and it's non-GMO. I'm not entirely sure what GMO
[38:21.640 --> 38:26.340]  is but I know I don't like it. Cosmic Crisp apples pack a flavor that is a perfect balance of sweet
[38:26.340 --> 38:31.740]  and tart making them versatile for all the ways you want to enjoy apples. For instance, we were
[38:31.740 --> 38:34.960]  supposed to do it today but we're going to do it next week. Everybody's going to come over to my
[38:34.960 --> 38:39.540]  house and we're going to have an apple pie making contest which is going to be interesting because
[38:39.540 --> 38:43.580]  the only rule is that we're not allowed to use recipes and none of us know how to make apple
[38:43.580 --> 38:48.560]  pies. But I do know that whatever we make is going to taste better because Cosmic Crisp apples will
[38:48.560 --> 38:54.560]  be inside it. It's also available in all seasons at grocery stores nationwide and it's an American
[38:54.560 --> 39:00.340]  original born and bred right here in Washington State after more than 20 years of research and
[39:00.340 --> 39:05.140]  development at Washington State University. When was the last time you researched anything for 20
[39:05.140 --> 39:10.340]  years? Think about that. It's a bunch of really smart people devoting two entire decades.
[39:10.560 --> 39:15.260]  They rolled up their sleeves, you know, they unbuttoned their top button, they put their heads down
[39:15.260 --> 39:19.420]  and they started working on apples. They started working on Cosmic, they started working on Crisp
[39:19.420 --> 39:24.880]  and they didn't look up again until it was 20 years later. And when they did look up in their hands
[39:24.880 --> 39:25.640]  they had
[39:33.810 --> 39:38.810]  the Cosmic Crisp. Learn more about Cosmic Crisp by going to their website where they have like
[39:38.810 --> 39:43.090]  recipe ideas, they'll help you figure out where to buy apples if you don't know. It's a pretty
[39:43.090 --> 39:46.870]  awesome site. They're also on social media and they love to hear from regulation listeners and
[39:46.870 --> 39:51.010]  comment leavers. Check them out on X, check them out on Instagram. I think on Instagram they are
[39:51.010 --> 39:57.530]  the Cosmic Crisp and on X I think they're Cosmic Crisp Apple. And I know you've heard us talk
[39:57.530 --> 40:04.070]  about this in the past, but they last a very long time. They are designed to be slow to brown,
[40:04.170 --> 40:09.770]  giving you more time to enjoy them when you're ready, not when it's ready. But when you're ready
[40:09.770 --> 40:15.890]  you're going to find a super crisp, exceptionally juicy, beautifully bi-colored apple. It's got
[40:15.890 --> 40:19.690]  these things called lenticels that I have just learned about through this ad read. I had to
[40:19.690 --> 40:24.950]  look them up. And that's what gives it the look of like a starry night sky. And let's be honest,
[40:25.150 --> 40:29.870]  haven't we all wanted to eat the sky a little bit? Just take a big bite out of the stars?
[40:30.850 --> 40:34.870]  That's Cosmic Crisp for you. Oh also, I think they're going to have merch launching soon,
[40:34.950 --> 40:39.950]  so go to their website again, CosmicCrisp.com and maybe pick up Apple shirts. So thank you to
[40:39.950 --> 40:44.570]  Cosmic Crisp for making the regulation apple and thank you to Cosmic Crisp for supporting this
[40:44.570 --> 40:50.370]  podcast. We love you. This show is sponsored by BetterHelp. What are some things that you want
[40:50.370 --> 40:56.190]  to keep the same about yourself or your new life in 2024? Where are you already killing it? Think
[40:56.190 --> 41:01.270]  of the opposite of new year, new you. Because like around new years we get obsessed with these ideas
[41:01.270 --> 41:05.330]  about how to change ourselves instead of expanding on what we're already doing right. Like everybody
[41:05.330 --> 41:11.010]  wants to have a new year's resolution, but maybe the resolution you need is to continue doing stuff
[41:11.010 --> 41:15.470]  you're already doing well. Maybe you finally organized one part of your space and now you
[41:15.470 --> 41:20.310]  want to tackle another or maybe you've been really good about taking your vitamins and supplements
[41:20.310 --> 41:25.510]  every morning and now you want to add in breakfast too. Therapy helps you find your strengths like
[41:25.510 --> 41:29.530]  that so that you can ditch those extreme resolutions and then make changes that will
[41:29.530 --> 41:33.210]  actually stick. I don't know about you, but I have, I didn't do it this year, but I've made
[41:33.210 --> 41:37.030]  new year's resolutions most of the years of my life and I don't know that I've kept any of them.
[41:37.030 --> 41:41.270]  Probably because I wasn't focusing on the right things. I have been in therapy for
[41:41.270 --> 41:49.330]  more than a decade now, probably 15 years or so, and I have to say it has been such a stabilizing
[41:49.330 --> 41:58.990]  force in my life. Whether I'm trying to navigate a really complex, painful personal issue or
[41:59.510 --> 42:06.070]  just looking for a little bit of insight into some life-changing career decisions I might want
[42:06.070 --> 42:10.890]  to make, therapy has been there for me. My therapist has been there for me to really
[42:10.890 --> 42:15.890]  help guide me along and I don't know what I would do without it. I really don't.
[42:16.030 --> 42:20.170]  So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try. It is entirely online,
[42:20.590 --> 42:24.730]  it's designed to be convenient, it's flexible, and it's suited to your schedule. Just fill out

[42:36.910 --> 42:42.250]  already made. Visit BetterHelp.com slash face today to get 10% off your first month. That's

[42:54.170 --> 43:04.750]  but front front backpack and potential front front backpack hoodie while we have zipper beanie.
[43:04.990 --> 43:10.570]  I think if we can get an in front out back shirt, it's gonna be absolutely phenomenal.
[43:16.710 --> 43:21.670]  Just feels like the sky's the limit right now. Does It Do is coming out. We had a meeting
[43:21.670 --> 43:29.230]  where we just went over a bunch of like new ideas. And Geoff's scrawled it all out in like
[43:29.230 --> 43:36.050]  serial killer handwriting on a board. It's really great stuff. It only took us three years as a show
[43:36.050 --> 43:42.090]  to have a creative meeting that was not like us recording a content piece. A dude and it was
[43:42.090 --> 43:45.930]  putting all the ideas. It's what I really wanted to get together and do it. Putting all the ideas
[43:45.930 --> 43:50.970]  together on one whiteboard and seeing what we just have floating out there that we've already
[43:50.970 --> 43:56.630]  talked about was staggering. There's probably 70 things on that board to fill. Well, it got to the
[43:56.630 --> 44:00.710]  point where Eric actively wanted you to stop writing stuff down. Like you just started writing
[44:00.710 --> 44:06.050]  drafts at one point, draft ideas. It's going to fill the whole board. Stop. It was they would have
[44:06.050 --> 44:09.410]  just taken up so much real estate. And it's like, well, we know we're going to do drafts. We know
[44:09.410 --> 44:13.370]  we're going to do. Yeah, I just want to get a couple of couple of the easy, good ones out
[44:13.370 --> 44:17.070]  ideas out on paper just so they're there. So they're, you know, they're cemented. The top
[44:17.070 --> 44:21.890]  I don't know that we'll ever post a picture of the board, whatever it it's in our office.
[44:22.090 --> 44:26.670]  The top of it is giant letters and the bottom of it is the smallest letters you've ever seen.
[44:29.310 --> 44:34.830]  We had more ideas than I initially thought. We also within eight seconds of you writing,
[44:34.950 --> 44:37.930]  we we already had to rub stuff out because we couldn't understand it.
[44:39.630 --> 44:42.990]  Yeah, I know. Listen, I can't defend my handwriting.
[44:44.090 --> 44:46.610]  It bothers me more than it bothers you. I promise you.
[44:47.190 --> 44:52.350]  Why don't you take a like a calligraphy course? Oh yeah. Why don't you go fuck yourself?
[44:55.590 --> 45:00.530]  All right, well, why don't you go? Why don't you go sign up and take a fucking class in your 30s?
[45:02.150 --> 45:07.150]  48 years old. No, good point. You'll be too busy stuffing your face with croutons to be worried.
[45:10.890 --> 45:14.530]  That's a great question about the croutons. Do they need to be the same flavor? Do they
[45:14.530 --> 45:19.770]  need to be identical? Yeah, I'll match whatever Gracie has. If Gracie wants a smorgasbord of like
[45:19.770 --> 45:24.850]  12 different flavors mixed into a bowl, I'm fine with that, too. Whatever. Any and all croutons
[45:24.850 --> 45:30.350]  will be fine for me. I don't care. How many do you think we need to get? 200? Yeah.
[45:32.270 --> 45:35.570]  500? She does want that. I'll be honest with you, Gracie. I kind of do, too.
[45:37.030 --> 45:44.110]  Uh, when should we film this? Next week? Yeah, I mean, I mean, probably. Oh, well, tomorrow we're
[45:44.110 --> 45:47.930]  doing a bunch of Let's Play stuff, aren't we? I mean, we haven't. I think so. I think it's for
[45:47.930 --> 45:51.990]  Let's Play. Let's let's do some trucks. Yeah. Oh, yeah. We gotta do trucks. We're doing trucks?
[45:52.610 --> 45:55.210]  I think we're gonna do trucks tomorrow. Everybody make sure your trucks is updated.
[45:56.390 --> 46:00.830]  Oh, speaking of, I was playing trucks last night and we're talking about 2024 and looking ahead
[46:00.830 --> 46:04.970]  and what it's going to be. Burndog reminded me we were playing trucks and he said, hey,
[46:04.970 --> 46:08.930]  I haven't heard an update on the on your hot dog races in a while. What's going on with the
[46:08.930 --> 46:13.770]  Plinko machine? What's going on with Gavin wanting to shoot the hot dog over the building with the
[46:13.770 --> 46:18.810]  too strong gun? I want to know. And I was like, oh, shit, we definitely shouldn't drop the ball
[46:18.810 --> 46:22.910]  on that. I also had another idea. When we do it, we could do a luge. At least a drop it slowly.
[46:23.710 --> 46:29.770]  We could do a mustard luge. That way the hot dog is getting lubed as it's going down the luge.
[46:30.430 --> 46:36.730]  A luge? A luge. Yeah. So anyway, we need to keep maybe next time we get together for an office
[46:36.730 --> 46:39.970]  day, we need to start planning that out a little bit. Yeah, let's just get a big calendar. One
[46:39.970 --> 46:42.730]  of those big. I don't think I don't think we have to plan it out. I think we just have to pick a day
[46:42.730 --> 46:47.190]  to do it. Well, we need to go buy the supplies and stuff, too. Right. Right. Which we can do
[46:47.450 --> 46:50.890]  beforehand. We don't have to have a meeting to do that. But it's like it's like six or seven ideas.
[46:51.030 --> 46:53.890]  Well, it's like six or seven ideas. We just need to simplify it and figure out what we're going
[46:53.890 --> 46:57.490]  to do first. Got it. You know, because I don't think we're going to make the Plinko machine
[46:57.490 --> 47:02.590]  first because that seems complicated. You know, isn't it just a bunch of like pegs and a board?
[47:03.410 --> 47:08.210]  Oh, do you have those? I feel like they're easy to find. Yeah. Why don't you take a calligraphy
[47:08.210 --> 47:14.150]  class, Andrew? Yeah. Yeah. I got to get the pegs first and I'll do that. I just think it's going
[47:14.150 --> 47:19.290]  to be harder to build a giant Plinko machine and try to figure out how to dress a hot dog as it goes
[47:19.290 --> 47:23.790]  down than it is to slap some wheels on a hot dog and go down like a Hot Wheels track. I'm just
[47:23.790 --> 47:28.170]  saying like we'll stair step our way into it, but we're not going to do it all at once.
[47:28.950 --> 47:32.530]  Maybe we'll do that. Maybe we'll shoot the hot dog over the building first. I don't know.
[47:33.030 --> 47:41.370]  I can't wait. Also, real fast, I told a story about how I was awakened by either God or destiny.
[47:41.630 --> 47:46.030]  The other I think it was in the last episode that came out. I've been getting inundated with people
[47:46.030 --> 47:50.490]  that are letting me know that the time in the morning that I woke up at 313 in the morning
[47:50.490 --> 47:57.330]  meant nothing to me. But that is the Detroit area code. So got it. Oh, got it. Message received.
[47:57.430 --> 48:03.050]  Thank you. Huh. So you're saying I should bet on the lions is what you're telling me. Yes,
[48:03.070 --> 48:07.890]  I think that's what I'm saying. Okay. Oh, and but since we're talking about 2024 and things to
[48:07.890 --> 48:14.210]  expect, I had an idea at the party that I ran by Eric. For the rest of y'all, I want to see what
[48:14.210 --> 48:19.530]  y'all think. I want to see what everybody's vibe for 2024 is going to be like. I sat down and I
[48:19.530 --> 48:24.790]  tried to think about what's my 2024 vibe going to be. And I decided I'm all about eating hummus
[48:24.790 --> 48:28.610]  and listening to Belle and Sebastian in 2024. That's what I'm doing the whole fucking year.
[48:29.470 --> 48:37.950]  Eric, what did you say your vibe is in 2024? My vibe in 2024 is going to be, I don't know if you
[48:37.950 --> 48:44.650]  guys remember, but Jason Mraz was a popular artist in the early 2000s. And my vibe is going to be
[48:44.650 --> 48:51.850]  Jason Mraz hats. Hell yeah. Okay. That fits. Right? I think doing little Jason Mraz hats.
[48:52.290 --> 48:56.510]  He has different styles and different looks, but it's always a tiny little hat. And I think I'm
[48:56.510 --> 49:01.010]  into that. I think this year, I'm going to give it a shot. Tiny little hat. I could see it. You
[49:01.010 --> 49:07.410]  dancing on a dance floor at Geoff's wedding with one of those hats on all fits. It really gels.
[49:07.710 --> 49:12.570]  I just think that I just think those little tiny hats, I don't love it. It's not a good look,
[49:12.570 --> 49:21.030]  but it's definitely, it might be my vibe. I think so. It's good stuff.
[49:21.570 --> 49:25.970]  I think it's great. I think it's great. And you can have different hats for different occasions
[49:25.970 --> 49:31.410]  and days. Do you have a vibe for 2024 Gavin? It just feels beachy. Yeah. Gavin,
[49:31.410 --> 49:34.770]  what are you doing for 2024? Yeah. What is it Gavin? Monkey business.
[49:36.190 --> 49:40.290]  Yeah. That's a great vibe for you. What do you mean by monkey business?
[49:41.370 --> 49:44.770]  Um, I don't really know what it means yet. They just asked me this on New Year's Eve and
[49:44.770 --> 49:48.970]  immediately monkey business came into my head. So I'm just going to try and make that apply.
[49:49.430 --> 49:52.390]  I mean, I feel like that was your vibe for 2023 and 2022 and 2021.
[49:52.650 --> 49:54.330]  You think I've been monkey business this whole time?
[49:54.490 --> 49:57.730]  You've been a monkey business fellow the entire time I've known you, but that's fine. It's part
[49:57.730 --> 50:00.230]  of your charm. That's what I like about you. I guess that's a part of me.
[50:00.690 --> 50:04.570]  Yeah. There's nothing wrong with that. Lean into it. Make 2024 the most monkey
[50:04.570 --> 50:09.030]  of business years you've ever had. Andrew, what immediately came into your head when you
[50:09.030 --> 50:15.630]  heard about all these vibes? 2024. My vibe is self-care. I'm invested heavily in that. Upgrading
[50:15.630 --> 50:23.950]  the bed situation as I think I mentioned before on grip strength. I got a weighted eye mask for
[50:23.950 --> 50:28.470]  Christmas that I've been using, but I've had a weird problem and I feel like I'm going to be
[50:28.470 --> 50:33.290]  really dumb when I say this is going to come across as stupid, but I've been using it and
[50:33.290 --> 50:38.370]  I've encountered an issue of I can't tell if my eyes are closed or not. And it has been giving me
[50:38.370 --> 50:44.770]  hallucinations because it blocks out all the light. And then I just don't know if my eyes are
[50:44.770 --> 50:48.870]  open and I'm not seeing anything or if my eyes are closed. I know exactly what you mean. I have
[50:48.870 --> 50:55.090]  them all the time. And I can't sleep with my eyes open. So I just sit there going, are my eyes open
[50:55.090 --> 51:00.230]  right now or are they closed? I would like to sleep. It's almost a nightly dilemma for me,
[51:00.310 --> 51:05.410]  but I always have to convince myself it doesn't matter. Yeah. I'm so glad. If I can't tell,
[51:05.410 --> 51:11.050]  why does it? Thank you. I'm going to start thinking about that. That's what I'm going to
[51:11.050 --> 51:15.890]  use because that has been the problem. The other thing I've done as part of self-care is I've
[51:15.890 --> 51:22.970]  decided to go heavy into the massage machine game and I am having a great time. I'm going to have
[51:22.970 --> 51:29.570]  to take a photo. I am like the Robocop of relaxation is what I got going on. I got a whole contraption
[51:29.570 --> 51:36.210]  I throw over my shoulders for my shoulders. I got one for my hand. I got a station for my feet
[51:36.210 --> 51:40.590]  under my desk so I could just give my feet a little massage. I'm all about massage machines
[51:40.590 --> 51:48.110]  in this 2024. You've got modular relaxation. I have. I am like the 300 dollar man of Chinese
[51:48.110 --> 51:56.650]  accessories. It's it's great. They've innovated the massage game and I'm excited. I'll have to
[51:56.650 --> 52:01.250]  send you guys a photo of me and my current sleep setup. It is... I like that your year of
[52:01.250 --> 52:11.010]  self-care started with 17 unhappy meals. That was that was a real problem of ordering those and
[52:11.010 --> 52:15.690]  having like two days left in the year. But I view like the first two weeks of the new year is like
[52:15.690 --> 52:20.250]  this. You got to slowly get into it. You can't just immediately start new routines. You got to
[52:20.250 --> 52:25.710]  slowly get into it. If you try to like pull the band-aid off and jump headfirst in, you'll you'll
[52:25.710 --> 52:30.990]  burn out in like two weeks. Totally. You gotta do these things gradually. We're in the transitional
[52:30.990 --> 52:36.970]  phase of setting up what will be the year of self-care. What about uh what about you Gracie
[52:36.970 --> 52:43.270]  and you Nick? I'm uh I'm going into the new year yacht rocking. I want to spend more time seaside
[52:43.270 --> 52:49.430]  with a Mai Tai in my hand. Oh that's awesome. I got a playlist for you. I'll send it your way.
[52:49.710 --> 52:55.550]  You already did. It's a good playlist. I got it. Hell yeah. It might have influenced his whole vibe.
[52:55.550 --> 53:01.250]  You sent mine. I'll be and I'll be watching. I'll be watching from a distance with my little hat on.
[53:02.470 --> 53:06.530]  Oh we're gonna sail away. What about uh
[53:09.530 --> 53:17.690]  what about you Gracie? Yeah Gracie what's your vibe? You know like the music that plays in a
[53:17.690 --> 53:23.950]  really fancy hotel that's like slow jazz? Yes. And then like like one of those old
[53:23.950 --> 53:29.750]  sophisticated men that listens to that and eats like trail mix in the corner. Okay. I just I need
[53:29.750 --> 53:38.630]  to point out what Gracie wrote is fancy hotel lobby jazz and salty snacks. And what she said was
[53:38.630 --> 53:45.610]  I want to be an old man in a hotel lobby who eats. I get it. Chex mix? Is that what you said? Yeah like
[53:45.610 --> 53:49.770]  trail mix. Like trail mix. Yeah like an old man snack. Like you know you know he's lived a good
[53:49.770 --> 53:55.510]  life when you look at it. Yeah that's a great and I relate to that because there are times where I'll
[53:55.510 --> 54:01.290]  throw Miles Davis on and pretend I know more about the world than I do. It's an understandable vibe.
[54:01.830 --> 54:05.910]  You know he's lived a good life. So how are you going to employ this? Are you gonna just start
[54:05.910 --> 54:10.970]  sitting in lobbies? In fancy lobbies? Yeah I'm gonna start at the Austin. In like a dress? All the way around.
[54:11.710 --> 54:18.630]  No not a dress. I'll have to work on the outfit. Because it's fancy. It will it will include like
[54:18.630 --> 54:24.710]  the narrow glasses though for sure. I don't think that she necessarily needs to show up fancy. I think
[54:24.710 --> 54:31.630]  it's about absorbing the fanciness around you. Is how I would. I think if I can give a suggestion
[54:32.250 --> 54:39.190]  I think that Gracie needs a smoking jacket that she can wear to hotel. Oh yeah yeah.
[54:39.910 --> 54:44.930]  I think I think we should take this literally and you should hang out in hotel lobbies.
[54:44.930 --> 54:49.250]  Because that was a thing that was really big like in the 20s and the 30s. It was a lot of
[54:49.250 --> 54:54.070]  a lot about staying in a hotel was the socialization, reading the paper, running into people
[54:54.070 --> 55:00.010]  you knew in the lobby. It was much more of a feature of older hotels. So maybe Gracie's gonna
[55:00.010 --> 55:04.670]  usher that era back in. Yeah I think you're on a very fine line though because if you're sat there
[55:04.670 --> 55:09.550]  in that eating some fancy trail mix or something that's that's a certain look. If you switch to a
[55:09.550 --> 55:14.410]  just a bag of croutons you're gonna start to look like the dude a little bit I think. Well I'm not
[55:14.410 --> 55:19.610]  eating them from the bag. I'll like put them in a little bowl. Okay so you won't know. All right
[55:19.610 --> 55:25.370]  yeah it'll blend. I didn't even consider the outfit component to this and this has me excited
[55:25.370 --> 55:31.210]  because this has opened up a whole new layer of the self-comfort game. I know that I will have hit
[55:31.210 --> 55:37.210]  my ultimate form if I end up with one of these hats by the end of the year for uh when I go to
[55:37.210 --> 55:42.390]  bed. I'm dropping a photo in. I want to look like fucking Ebenezer Scrooge by the end of 2024.
[55:42.390 --> 55:47.770]  You're just got the long cap. You want a honk shoe hat. I got one of those literally for Christmas.
[55:47.930 --> 55:54.670]  Oh that's so that's there's nothing cozier than one of those. Yeah. What was the point of those?
[55:54.770 --> 56:01.910]  Why are they so droopy? It's maximum comfort obviously. They just were worse at making clothes
[56:01.910 --> 56:10.850]  back then. It does look like they cut the bottom of like a curtain thing and then just attached it
[56:10.850 --> 56:16.770]  fucking sew the top. What are we here? Andrew, Andrew, when you wear that hat and you snore
[56:16.770 --> 56:23.830]  are you going honk shoe honk shoe or are you going yeah I'm going to be me. That's cool.
[56:25.310 --> 56:30.410]  Has anyone ever slept on their hands like when people pretend to do the sleeping gesture? Has
[56:30.410 --> 56:35.490]  anyone ever slept like that? Slept on their hands? Oh yeah. Put your hands together and put it.
[56:36.590 --> 56:43.130]  Absolutely. You gotta I do like this the phone hold I'd say is the the position with my hand
[56:43.130 --> 56:48.690]  or it's under the pillow and bent back. Okay yeah I fall asleep with like one hand under
[56:48.690 --> 56:51.870]  like every night. Yeah I go under the pillow. I just never sleep on my actual hand.
[56:52.510 --> 56:58.490]  No I don't think I've slept on my hand. That's a good point. You should try it. See how it is.
[56:58.590 --> 57:02.830]  We should all try to sleep on our hands in the hand sleeping position. I'm willing to try anything
[57:02.830 --> 57:09.330]  in this year of comfort. I'm up for it. If it'll increase the sleep I'm about it. As long as I can
[57:09.330 --> 57:13.230]  eat hummus occasionally I'm good to go. Well that actually that reminds me of a thing I got
[57:13.230 --> 57:18.030]  myself for Christmas. I bought a security system just in case we have a monopoly situation with
[57:18.030 --> 57:24.670]  Gavin again in the future. I got some cameras and a setup but then I had the realization that
[57:24.670 --> 57:35.290]  when I go to sleep now I get my weighted eye mask on then I put my headphones on and I blast
[57:35.290 --> 57:42.310]  thunderstorms and then fall asleep and it doesn't... me having a security camera is completely useless
[57:42.310 --> 57:50.270]  because I am not in this dimension. I can't hear anything. I can't see anything. I have zero alert
[57:50.270 --> 57:54.350]  for what is happening in my environment around me. Where do you stand on weighted blanket?
[57:54.770 --> 58:00.770]  I haven't ever tried a weighted blanket so I don't... I hear good things but I've never
[58:00.770 --> 58:06.250]  experienced it. It's a part of my wife's 26 point nightly routine. And yeah it's an oppressive
[58:06.250 --> 58:13.470]  routine. Yeah she swears by it. Might want to give it a shot. I found out recently that when you uh
[58:13.470 --> 58:20.570]  when you physically lose weight it comes out of your mouth. Like you breathe the weight away.
[58:20.990 --> 58:27.670]  It comes out I guess as the carbon in carbon dioxide. Are you sure you're about to explain
[58:27.670 --> 58:32.770]  to me your new program of breathe the weight away? Well I just thought like what if I breathe in the
[58:32.770 --> 58:42.170]  same bag for like a whole year? Could I breathe myself into a bag? What are you talking about?
[58:42.170 --> 58:45.670]  Like could I capture my own carbon? Oh.
[58:48.010 --> 58:54.990]  Like how much would it take for me to breathe out my own weight in solid carbon? Yeah. Well
[58:54.990 --> 59:00.210]  how long would it take for you to lose all of your weight? Well I don't know. I just don't even know
[59:00.210 --> 59:03.930]  what it looks like. When you when you do carbon capture what does the carbon look like? Yeah.
[59:03.990 --> 59:11.050]  Because I'm imagining it's just like a load of flesh. I think it's a question of how much weight
[59:11.050 --> 59:16.250]  is how much carbon weight is the average breath right? And then it's a measurement of how many
[59:16.250 --> 59:22.910]  times you breathe per night across a year. I don't know if there's a metric on that.
[59:25.150 --> 59:29.350]  We'd have to have someone look it up but that's yeah. Yeah I think it'd be interesting if I just
[59:29.350 --> 59:39.990]  had like a 10 stone lump of carbon that came from me. I don't know anyone who has one.
[59:41.130 --> 59:44.010]  You would definitely be in a unique group.
[59:46.150 --> 59:50.010]  That's like a serial killer thing I feel like is what you're explaining.
[59:52.090 --> 59:54.710]  Breathe out a twin? Yeah. I want a double.
[59:56.350 --> 01:00:03.250]  Just what would you do with your double? A carbon copy as it were. A little CC. I'd sit
[01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:10.970]  him in a chair. I don't know how pliable my carbon twin would be. I don't think it's pliable at
[01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:14.650]  all. I think you gotta lock it in. It'd be like a rock. Yeah I think it's like a statue.
[01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:20.230]  Didn't you see that Jordan Peele movie about doubles? I don't think you want to make one.
[01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:27.190]  It's not going to like you. The thing that I took away from the movie was called Us right?
[01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:38.010]  Us yeah. That movie made me understand Kawhi Leonard. Kawhi Leonard we know is the one that
[01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:43.810]  escaped underground. It gave me a context to Kawhi Leonard that finally made sense.
[01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:58.370]  That was my takeaway from that film. It was my least favorite of his films but I enjoyed it.
[01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:03.010]  It has a great atmosphere to it. It does for sure. It's got good acting in it too. It's creepy.
[01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:10.290]  Very creepy. Oh hey I went to the mall yesterday to run some tests because Andrew and I have been
[01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:16.950]  working on our mall game that we're going to create. I think it's damn near ready. Very excited
[01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:21.230]  about it. It's really... I'm very excited. I'm very excited too. Andrew's going to run it and
[01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:25.130]  then we're all going to perform it. We're all going to compete against each other. I think
[01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:29.270]  it's going to be right up there with Sloppy Joe's Bingo in terms of how much fun we have doing it.
[01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:35.490]  I agree, yeah. The possibilities are really... it's one of those things where the deeper we get
[01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:39.950]  the more options that seem available. I'm really excited. What can I know about the format?
[01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:48.710]  I think structurally it's sort of like Taskmaster where Gracie would be in the Alex role of like the
[01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:57.970]  ref that approves things. And it is a challenge show in which it is stuff relating to the mall
[01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:04.390]  and it could be theme challenges or it could just be a sort of grab bag of like take a photo
[01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:09.730]  or buy a thing or do some form of other experience or like mall interaction.
[01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:15.850]  Andrew and I came up with about 60 different tasks. And there's a prize for winning every
[01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:21.890]  episode that is very exciting. Who's being Greg Davis from the Inbetweeners? That's me.
[01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:28.490]  I'm going to be like the organizer of what's happening and Gracie will be there to monitor
[01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:34.710]  and make sure that everything is above board. And then so then Geoff, Gavin, Nick, and Eric
[01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:39.630]  would compete against each other. But it might be team based. Could be team. Yeah,
[01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:43.970]  we're in the development phase, but it's from what we have, I think it'll be a lot of fun.
[01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:47.750]  Nick's come up with an interesting name for it. He has.
[01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:53.190]  Fuckmaster. Yeah, we're not calling it that. We're not. No, we're not calling it that.
[01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:59.370]  Absolutely not. Fuckmaster goes to the mall. We should we should maybe for the first time
[01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:04.030]  in the history of this company, think of a second name and then go with that one.
[01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:08.050]  I was calling it King of the Mall, but that's just what I wrote down for my name,
[01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:13.190]  just for my notes. We call it whatever we want to. Although Fuckmaster, you know,
[01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:23.070]  it's possible it could be. I had a dumb idea of our prizes will be in a bag that you'll pull from
[01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:29.910]  at the end and call it a sack pack, if you sort of a sack pack type thing, but calling it the mall
[01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:35.910]  hall or the hall, the hall of mall, mall hall, like mall hall. But it could be the show could
[01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:40.750]  be called Mall Hall and the prize bag could be Hall of Mall. Oh, that's interesting.
[01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:44.670]  Yeah, we have a little bit of tweak. We have options. I think we'll be I think we'll be ready
[01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:52.690]  to shoot it here pretty soon. Gavin suggested Fuckbag. Fuckmasters, Fuckbag. Go into the
[01:03:52.690 --> 01:04:02.650]  Fuckbag for winning Fuckmaster and pull yourself out a prize. This is a mess. I guess this year
[01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:07.450]  isn't going to be any more intelligent than the last. No, no, no, no. I really didn't anticipate
[01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:12.670]  that. That's not the vibe for this show for this year. I don't think at all. We're doing front
[01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:17.590]  front back back shirts. I don't think there's any genius happening here. It's a definite year
[01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:23.410]  of innovation. It sounds like speaking of. Oh, go ahead. Your intelligence. We both have
[01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:32.830]  moments of intelligence. Please, you go first. I was going to say that over the holidays,
[01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:39.430]  Gavin and my partner got into a heated text exchange over my phone about whether the desks
[01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:45.730]  would launch at different speeds. Oh, my God. Everyone's a fool. Everyone's. It's annoying
[01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:49.150]  because the episode where we talked about it hasn't come out yet still. So I don't really know
[01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:53.310]  where the audience stands. But I just feel like everyone is so wrong. Yeah, I'm with you. Except
[01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:58.610]  me. I'm with you. Well, don't say except me. I'm right there with you. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm with
[01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:03.750]  Gavin too. Until more people are with Gavin, then I'm against them. It was one of those things
[01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:07.330]  where I couldn't forward back and forth the conversation. So I just gave my phone to my
[01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:13.430]  partner and they Gavin and then went back and forth for like 20 minutes just on how physics work.
[01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:18.270]  And I think it ended with them saying, I'm going to sleep. Yeah, they have to go to sleep.
[01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:26.290]  So what I did after that is I asked Gavin to explain to me what he is asking. And so then I
[01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:35.070]  took that and I emailed like the top seven physicists in the world to see if we could get
[01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:43.870]  a professional. What? Well, you can just so I just Googled top physicists in the world and I found a
[01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:51.190]  list of like every country's best physicist. And what country did you pick? It was like America
[01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:56.470]  and Canada and Africa and Australia. What country?
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.660]  Listen, I'm trying to help you.
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:18.180]  Anyway, Pangea. I emailed all of them and because most of them work at universities,
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:21.220]  so they have public email addresses that you can find pretty easily.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:29.260]  Uh, we have yet to get a reply from any of the people I've reached out to. So who knows?
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:35.080]  The debate is still it lives on. You might want to just widen your circle to like maybe like the
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:42.300]  top 100 physicists in the world. And I feel like I'm getting some emails. Yeah. Or like maybe the
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:47.060]  bottom 50 physicists in the world. Like like you know what they call the shittiest physicist in
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:50.880]  America or in the world? A physicist. We could just get we get the bottom of the barrel. They're still
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:07:00.420]  physicists, right? Huh? You think I went too high? The dumbest physicist on earth is smarter than
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:06.400]  all of us put together. Yeah. And I will say they probably listen to this show. So if you're a
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:12.860]  physicist, just go ahead and contact Andrew. And I'm sure I mean, again, we're not saying you're
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:18.800]  at the bottom of your field. We are saying you're above us in knowing these things. That's all.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:22.960]  You've had like three weeks to think about it. And I assume you've been thinking about it every
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.880]  every day. Have you come to any different standings stance on it?
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.020]  I've done everything I could to not think about it.
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:37.420]  Okay, well, we need a man of science, a man of knowledge. Why don't I just tweet at Bill Nye,
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:41.660]  the science guy? I'm sure he has. Oh, I did a show with him once. I bet he doesn't remember me,
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:47.260]  though. Oh, almost certainly not. I don't think I made much of an impression on him. I was drinking
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:57.120]  pretty heavily back then. I wasn't at my best. Okay, I'm going to tweet this. We're going to
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.260]  figure this out. We're going to get a professional opinion. We got to wrap this up. But Geoff,
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.780]  is there something you wanted to get after? It sounded like there was another thing you
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:09.620]  wanted to talk about. Oh, Andrew and I spoke at the same time and said the same thing.
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:14.920]  I was going to say, speaking of innovation or whatever, looking ahead at 2024, I've noticed
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:21.180]  a lot of other podcasts and entertainment brands have been making predictions for the year 2024,
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:26.000]  and I wanted to see if y'all had any or wanted to make any, or even maybe we just come back next
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.500]  week, see if there's any 2024 predictions you want to make. I had a dream about 2024,
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:35.140]  either last year or the year before, and it was a giant volcano.
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:39.720]  I mean, that's not good based on your track record, right?
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:46.980]  Yeah, you've been in volcanoes. It's not great. I had a dream last night that one of my legs was
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:51.660]  super muscly, so maybe I'm going to get into like leg muscle building or something. You had a jacked
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:56.780]  leg. I had a jacked, my right leg was, my thigh was like crazy jacked, and people were like really
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:09:01.460]  impressed with it. But it was just, I think, just that thigh. I don't know why. So maybe I'll get
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:08.980]  into like, I guess, working out that specific muscle in 2024 on that one leg. Okay. Andrew?
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:15.180]  Sorry, I'm deep into this Bill Nye tweet. Predictions about 2024. Is that what we're
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:23.480]  doing? Yeah. Yeah. Jacked hands, as I said. I think I'm going to have the best sleep of 2024
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:38.740]  of my life. And general predictions, I think that 2024, the Atlanta Falcons are going to win the
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:46.980]  Falcons to the top. That's a bold statement. So your prediction is for 2025? Well, 2024, 2025.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:53.620]  Starts in 2025. Yeah, 2024, 2025 season. Right, so it's for 2025. I mean, they got a long...
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:58.780]  They're going to start the groundwork in 2024, Eric, for their Super Bowl in 2025.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:06.860]  Your prediction is groundwork? Yes. Well, my hot take, let me predict then,
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:10.140]  since we're going sports, that the Boston Celtics will win the NBA championship this year.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.700]  That's a fun one. Definitely predict that. Do you think...
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:20.180]  Let's do some... Do you think... Will Twitter go under this year or will it be even bigger?
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:25.360]  I was talking about that with Gavin. We think two years until it goes under. Within two years. Yeah.
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:31.440]  Okay. Do you think an asteroid will hit the Earth this year?
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.800]  Maybe on New Year's. Do you think we'll find alien life in 2024?
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:42.020]  My prediction is Bon Jovi won't get better at acting in 2024, and I feel confident about that.
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:47.260]  When I say alien life, I'm not saying like Kang and Kodos fly in and introduce themselves. I mean
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:52.920]  like microbial life on an asteroid or some goo or something. Astroidial goo?
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:57.460]  Yeah, like some sort of primordial life. Maybe that's what I'll create in my bag.
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:00.600]  Maybe that's what you're growing on the side of your tree.
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:04.580]  Have you taken an update on your fungus lately?
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:09.020]  No, I should have a little... I'll take pictures of everything and just track its growth.
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:13.000]  Can I get confirmation, Gavin, on this tweet? Make sure you're happy with it before I send it out.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.820]  Yeah. I mean, we don't need to tweet. We could just get two desks.
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:22.580]  If you stood on the top of 10 desks and all the desks raised at the same time,
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:27.420]  would you be moving at 10x the speed up? You need to say 10 standing desks.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:30.240]  Yeah, and you also need to say in relation to something.
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:35.580]  Well, I'm just... I copy and pasted what you sent me. So now you got notes on your own self.
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:40.860]  Will the 10th desk be moving at 10x faster than the first desk in relation to the ground?
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:41.820]  Got it.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:46.700]  Should we stop?
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.200]  Yeah, absolutely. 100%.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.740]  I'm excited about the crouton off and I think we can stack a couple of desks on the same day
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:55.500]  and just see what happens.
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:12:00.840]  I think we can. I think we can also say that Does It Do comes out on the 29th. So
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.460]  go to f***facepod.com and watch it there. Go to our YouTube channel and watch it there.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.020]  But Does It Do, we'll have... Did you guys shoot eight episodes, right?
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.580]  Yeah. Yeah, for some reason.
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:12.180]  And also only...
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.540]  What do you mean for some reason? What does that mean?
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.160]  Well, you added a bunch of shit that we didn't... we said no to for a start.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:22.240]  And also there was way less blood this season. There was some, but way less.
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:23.940]  Yeah, there was a little bit of blood.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:24.720]  Who's you?
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.040]  I hid it.
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:26.800]  What do you mean you?
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:30.300]  You said, you said you added a bunch of stuff. Who's you?
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:31.160]  You?
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:38.180]  Yeah. Who is you? Keep... Who's you? It's not me. I didn't add it. Who's you?
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:43.100]  Thanks for listening to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. Boy,
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:46.660]  are we excited to bring this to you each and every week in 2024.
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:48.620]  We hope you'll stay along for the ride.
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:48.820]  You're saying you is me?
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:50.460]  I'm not me!
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:51.720]  The questions were dog shit.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:52.100]  Who are you?
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.040]  I did what was written on the sheet.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:57.740]  We'll see you next week. Gavin, Eric, play us out with the argument.
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:00.300]  You're in on the memes. You say...
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:04.340]  It's not me. I didn't do it. You did. If anyone did it, you're closer to it.
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:10.060]  If anyone's closer to it, you did it. It's not me. It's not me. You're the person. No.
[01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:13.260]  Because we had to figure out this. We went through all these things.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.760]  And this was the reason that we did eight. We did eight because we had all these ideas.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.700]  We put through you. We said yes, yes, yes.
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.900]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.640]  The usual suspects are back.
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.440]  Did you know a Schwarzenegger was Russian?
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.080]  Andrew needs his bedtime.
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.120]  The gang discusses new movies.
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:33.780]  Gracie learns some Pantin lore.
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:35.820]  Gracie learns not to doubt Gavin.
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:36.980]  More food talk.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.180]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:40.440]  Or walk the marathon.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.760]  Or live up to any of the bets he ever lost.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.240]  But at least he's really good at making claims and not being able to back them up.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:49.180]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
