[00:09.760 --> 00:19.860]  I would absolutely love you, Geoff, to for one day fully commit to being fenced-er from the usual suspects and just do that all day.
[00:22.540 --> 00:25.260]  Oh man, that would be a long, hard day for Geoff.
[00:25.660 --> 00:25.920]  Yeah.
[00:27.320 --> 00:31.680]  If we each had to be a usual suspects guy, who's who?
[00:32.200 --> 00:33.960]  Oh. Oh.
[00:34.720 --> 00:35.940]  That's a good question.
[00:36.240 --> 00:37.040]  Oh, fuck.
[00:37.720 --> 00:38.980]  Uh, hold on.
[00:40.640 --> 00:41.160]  It's tough.
[00:41.820 --> 00:42.820]  Can I not be dead?
[00:44.160 --> 00:46.400]  Well, so you want to be Kaiser Soze?
[00:46.940 --> 00:48.580]  Yeah, he really wants to be... yeah, dude.
[00:48.800 --> 00:49.660]  I feel...
[00:49.660 --> 00:50.960]  Nick wants to be Spacey?
[00:51.120 --> 00:51.540]  Well, that's fucked up, dude.
[00:51.540 --> 00:53.560]  No, hold on. That's not what I said. Hold on.
[00:53.580 --> 00:55.020]  What the fuck, dude?
[00:55.640 --> 01:00.220]  I think, uh... I feel like I'm probably like a Kevin Pollack in that world.
[01:00.260 --> 01:04.340]  Yeah, I could... I get that. I get it. I get it.
[01:05.280 --> 01:05.680]  Hmm.
[01:06.460 --> 01:08.680]  I'm definitely, um...
[01:10.040 --> 01:10.420]  Hmm.
[01:11.080 --> 01:13.860]  You know, as much as I don't want to be, I'm Stephen Baldwin.
[01:14.200 --> 01:14.900]  You're Stephen Baldwin.
[01:14.900 --> 01:17.940]  I'm so glad you said it. I didn't want to say it for you.
[01:18.240 --> 01:18.660]  Absolutely.
[01:19.660 --> 01:20.820]  So, who's Gavin?
[01:21.400 --> 01:22.780]  Maybe I'm not Kevin Pollack.
[01:22.820 --> 01:23.540]  That's tough.
[01:23.900 --> 01:26.300]  Maybe Kaiser Soze's Gavin is Stuart.
[01:27.640 --> 01:28.200]  Oh!
[01:31.480 --> 01:32.660]  That's pretty good.
[01:32.880 --> 01:33.740]  Kaiser Stuart.
[01:33.740 --> 01:36.320]  Yeah, that's pretty good.
[01:36.320 --> 01:37.240]  Hey, Gracie?
[01:37.660 --> 01:37.960]  Hi.
[01:38.360 --> 01:40.180]  Who are you in The Usual Suspects?
[01:40.980 --> 01:42.160]  No chance of me seeing that guy.
[01:42.420 --> 01:42.820]  Wait, what?
[01:43.280 --> 01:43.560]  Exactly.
[01:45.160 --> 01:47.620]  You probably haven't... You might not have seen the movie.
[01:47.640 --> 01:51.860]  No, I have no idea, but based on this photo, I'm feeling drawn to the guy on the far left.
[01:52.480 --> 01:54.480]  Oh, wow. Pollack. You're Kevin Pollack.
[01:54.480 --> 01:55.160]  Kevin Pollack. Interesting.
[01:55.200 --> 01:56.380]  Something about his outfit.
[01:56.920 --> 01:59.960]  Yeah. I hear that. I hear that. Yeah.
[02:00.500 --> 02:02.080]  What year did this movie come out?
[02:02.080 --> 02:03.680]  What year did The Usual Suspects come out?
[02:03.680 --> 02:04.720]  98? 99? Somewhere around there?
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.060]  No, no, no, no. It came out before that, didn't it?
[02:07.060 --> 02:07.400]  96? 96?
[02:08.040 --> 02:08.440]  95.
[02:09.000 --> 02:09.660]  95. Okay.
[02:09.980 --> 02:10.120]  Yep.
[02:10.120 --> 02:11.000]  Gracie's the detective.
[02:11.880 --> 02:12.280]  Yeah.
[02:12.480 --> 02:18.480]  It was a movie that I watched when I was too young and did not enjoy at all and then came back around to later and liked it quite a bit.
[02:18.800 --> 02:23.620]  I tried to go back and watch it a few years ago and I couldn't make it 20 minutes in.
[02:23.980 --> 02:24.260]  Yeah.
[02:24.720 --> 02:29.240]  It's a weirdly... It's a weirdly paced and structured movie.
[02:29.240 --> 02:34.350]  It's not bad. It's very... It feels very 90s.
[02:35.060 --> 02:35.180]  Yeah.
[02:35.580 --> 02:40.760]  In a way... In a way that is, like, not enjoyable to look at.
[02:41.380 --> 02:43.340]  Oh, yeah. It's a very ugly movie.
[02:43.500 --> 02:45.080]  Also, I think...
[02:45.080 --> 02:45.400]  It is incredibly ugly.
[02:45.620 --> 02:54.660]  I just... I think the movie... I mean, the movie obviously was great for what it was and it definitely had an impression and it landed hard and...
[02:54.660 --> 02:55.520]  Yes. Huge. Yeah.
[02:55.520 --> 03:01.640]  But I think it's only because of the last 5 minutes of the film. The rest of the film is exceptionally mediocre.
[03:02.540 --> 03:09.420]  It's the twist. It's the same thing as the fucking... It's the same thing as the Bruce Willis movie where he's dead the whole time.
[03:10.000 --> 03:10.340]  6th Sense.
[03:10.660 --> 03:12.940]  Nobody on earth can watch 6th Sense twice.
[03:13.200 --> 03:13.600]  Agreed.
[03:13.760 --> 03:16.920]  Or the others. Or any of those films where the whole movie is the hook.
[03:16.920 --> 03:27.280]  But, like, there's only... Like, I feel like The Usual Suspect has the one other scene where they're, like, reading the, like, give me all your money, like, the stick-up line or whatever.
[03:27.420 --> 03:34.260]  I feel like that's the only other scene from that movie that I remember. And the rest of it is, like, I don't know, trying to be Heat. Remember Heat?
[03:34.500 --> 03:35.020]  It's like that.
[03:35.060 --> 03:38.720]  Heat's great. Yeah, it's kind of like Heat meets Reservoir Dogs but not...
[03:38.720 --> 03:38.940]  Yeah.
[03:39.280 --> 03:40.380]  That's a great comparable.
[03:40.440 --> 03:42.660]  Which is weird because Heat came out the same year.
[03:42.840 --> 03:43.160]  What?
[03:43.240 --> 03:43.600]  Really?
[03:43.900 --> 03:44.040]  Wow.
[03:44.320 --> 03:45.040]  Heat came out in 95.
[03:45.700 --> 03:47.900]  Heat feels like it's older to me than that.
[03:47.940 --> 03:50.780]  Oh, big time. Heat feels like an 89 to me.
[03:51.560 --> 03:51.920]  Goddamn.
[03:52.000 --> 03:52.140]  Yeah.
[03:52.480 --> 03:53.240]  What about Red Heat?
[03:53.520 --> 03:54.240]  Oh, with, uh...
[03:54.240 --> 03:55.480]  Oh, the Schwarzenegger movie and Jim Belushi?
[03:55.480 --> 03:56.720]  With Jonathan Schwarzenegger and Jim Belushi?
[03:57.220 --> 04:00.000]  That movie, uh, is... Dog shit?
[04:00.340 --> 04:02.240]  That movie came out, like, 88, 89?
[04:02.560 --> 04:03.280]  88. 88.
[04:03.940 --> 04:04.160]  Yeah.
[04:04.320 --> 04:04.560]  Dude.
[04:04.720 --> 04:06.200]  Why do you bring that up? Did you just watch it?
[04:06.640 --> 04:09.440]  I watched it a couple years ago. I was thinking of other Heat movies.
[04:10.080 --> 04:10.540]  The Heat?
[04:10.620 --> 04:10.960]  Oh!
[04:12.140 --> 04:12.980]  The Heat's a good movie.
[04:12.980 --> 04:16.920]  Maybe we should go through a Heat movie era.
[04:17.260 --> 04:21.940]  You think so? You really? So what you're proposing is we watch that movie?
[04:22.700 --> 04:26.940]  Well, it's funny you say that because it's already on my list of movies to watch.
[04:27.200 --> 04:30.740]  I have decided recently I'm gonna go through and rewatch every Arnold Schwarzenegger film.
[04:31.120 --> 04:31.900]  That's a mistake.
[04:32.140 --> 04:33.600]  Oh, that's a big mistake.
[04:34.080 --> 04:34.520]  I think so.
[04:35.180 --> 04:36.240]  Oh, I think...
[04:36.240 --> 04:37.840]  No, you're gonna hit a wave.
[04:37.840 --> 04:47.640]  I think... oh, yeah. I think you are going to hit... I think you're gonna hit it hard and then you're gonna realize, like, oh, he's in some bad...
[04:47.640 --> 04:50.740]  Name an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie I don't want to watch.
[04:50.860 --> 04:51.180]  Red Heat.
[04:51.360 --> 04:52.200]  Terminator Genisys.
[04:52.420 --> 04:53.580]  I want to watch Red Heat.
[04:54.160 --> 04:54.480]  No, you don't.
[04:54.500 --> 04:56.900]  Oh, Terminator Genisys is a real bad one.
[04:57.000 --> 05:02.800]  I saw Red Heat when I was a kid. All I remember is that they were always drinking vodka and it was cold.
[05:02.800 --> 05:09.900]  And Jim Belushi was funny and now I want to watch it and it'll be like watching it with seven-year-old me again.
[05:10.020 --> 05:12.840]  Or, fuck, what was I in, 88? 13.
[05:13.740 --> 05:16.500]  Yeah, I haven't seen it since I was 13. Of course I want to watch it.
[05:16.800 --> 05:19.500]  Terminator Genisys I've never seen. It's really bad.
[05:19.620 --> 05:23.420]  What's the one where there's the clones? You've got, like, the eyeball thing?
[05:24.620 --> 05:25.340]  Total Recall?
[05:25.360 --> 05:26.320]  Oh, the sixth day?
[05:27.080 --> 05:27.360]  Total Recall?
[05:27.360 --> 05:27.540]  Sixth day.
[05:27.600 --> 05:28.460]  Sixth day, that was it.
[05:28.560 --> 05:30.480]  I liked Sixth Day. Good movie.
[05:31.200 --> 05:31.520]  Is it?
[05:31.520 --> 05:32.400]  Yeah, I liked it.
[05:32.540 --> 05:32.880]  I need to re-watch that one.
[05:33.800 --> 05:40.480]  When Sean from Mega64 was getting married, we were all his groomsmen, all of Mega64 and everything, and he was really, really nervous.
[05:40.860 --> 05:47.040]  And we were about to go walk out, like the music started playing, but we were watching End of Days on a TV in this room we were getting ready for.
[05:47.320 --> 05:52.960]  And he's like, are you guys ready? And we said, no, we'll do five more minutes. This End of Days is almost done.
[05:53.380 --> 05:58.980]  And he laughed so hard and he went, oh, okay, this is not that serious. We're good. Okay, I don't feel so bad anymore.
[05:58.980 --> 06:02.680]  This is like, he felt really good about it after that. I'll always remember that.
[06:05.000 --> 06:09.960]  Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to watch every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie and I'm going to report back with what the worst one is.
[06:11.160 --> 06:11.880]  Red Heat?
[06:11.980 --> 06:17.840]  It's going to take me a year to do probably, as often as I watch movies, but I'm going to try it.
[06:18.080 --> 06:22.380]  When was the last time you watched something like Running Man, which was like in the heat of him?
[06:23.520 --> 06:28.820]  So I watched Running Man maybe eight, nine years ago again, and it's not good.
[06:29.120 --> 06:30.440]  It's really not. It's such a bummer.
[06:30.440 --> 06:35.360]  No, it doesn't hold up. It's so cartoony and goofy and you don't remember.
[06:35.940 --> 06:41.180]  Like, I remember it being so much cooler and darker when I was a kid and then you see it and it's just like, it's pretty silly.
[06:41.360 --> 06:46.700]  And so what I'm saying is that, like, I think that's going to be most of what he has.
[06:46.920 --> 06:51.500]  Yes, I can't wait. But see, I was a child of that. And so there's a charm to it.
[06:51.500 --> 06:58.100]  I grew up, you know, my entire childhood was Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone in their prime.
[06:58.300 --> 07:02.860]  And so I have an affinity and an affection for those guys that warms over a lot of bad acting.
[07:03.200 --> 07:08.260]  The idea that you recently revisited The Usual Suspects and was like, oh, that didn't hold up.
[07:08.400 --> 07:12.480]  But you're going to go back and watch Red Heat and think it's going to hold is insane.
[07:12.480 --> 07:18.200]  I think I watched Red Heat at first. I was 13 years old. There's a connection there.
[07:18.260 --> 07:23.160]  I watched Usual Suspects when I was 23 or something, maybe.
[07:23.620 --> 07:25.580]  Have we stied? I don't know.
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.720]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Face podcast.
[07:29.860 --> 07:34.880]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. And with me, as always, Gavin Free and Andrew Panton.
[07:34.880 --> 07:39.420]  And this is episode one hundred and ninety, I believe.
[07:40.520 --> 07:44.000]  I think I hurt my throat in Worms just now.
[07:44.600 --> 07:46.820]  All the yelling. You got Worms throat?
[07:47.420 --> 07:51.880]  Well, I just had probably the worst performance in Worms of my entire life.
[07:52.080 --> 07:54.800]  The one you won or the one you lost? Oh, my God. The one I won.
[07:55.020 --> 08:00.360]  I was thinking about it after we played and I've known you for a very long time.
[08:00.440 --> 08:02.560]  I think I saw a new side of Gavin today.
[08:02.560 --> 08:07.780]  I don't think I've ever seen Gavin, like, that much honest self-hatred.
[08:08.160 --> 08:10.060]  Well, I was pissing myself off.
[08:10.200 --> 08:16.240]  Like, it's been... I've definitely made content moves in my video game playing career.
[08:16.560 --> 08:23.100]  But that typically involves just, like, never braking in GTA or, like, hitting every bike or, like, firing a rocket launcher the second I pick it up.
[08:23.720 --> 08:26.540]  Pressing the wrong button has never been a content move.
[08:26.540 --> 08:32.440]  I just can't remember the frickin' buttons. And it's getting worse as I get older.
[08:32.920 --> 08:43.460]  There is some sort of a spell that is put over you when you play Worms where it just forces you to misremember two buttons constantly.
[08:43.460 --> 08:44.640]  I'm just happy we all did it.
[08:46.680 --> 08:48.400]  I... I'll never get it right.
[08:49.720 --> 08:54.480]  I appreciated a move Gavin did. I think that that in the future...
[08:54.480 --> 08:57.500]  If you can just keep the team that you use, Gavin...
[08:57.500 --> 08:58.300]  I'll try to help us out.
[08:59.080 --> 08:59.860]  I appreciate it.
[09:00.180 --> 09:08.620]  Dude, I'll say this. I'm learning over and over again. There is nothing in Worms more dangerous than one single pixel of dirt.
[09:10.200 --> 09:12.240]  Floating in the air that nobody can see.
[09:12.960 --> 09:14.620]  I thought you would have learned that from SnowRunner.
[09:15.640 --> 09:16.500]  That's my experience.
[09:16.500 --> 09:19.000]  I don't have the problems in SnowRunner that you do.
[09:19.200 --> 09:23.280]  I think we all do. I don't... I don't think it's just me. I think it's... the mud is a tough place.
[09:23.280 --> 09:27.300]  Mud is a tough place, but you got to know how to tackle it. You got to know how to approach it. You got to know how to take it on.
[09:27.600 --> 09:28.560]  I've been working on it.
[09:28.600 --> 09:33.260]  Mud wants to take you down. You don't let mud take you down. You take mud down. That's how trucking works.
[09:33.400 --> 09:37.580]  It does. Yes. Also, the mud will flip you over.
[09:38.720 --> 09:45.620]  I was playing with someone recently and I flipped over and they had to stop what they were doing to get me upright again.
[09:45.920 --> 09:49.040]  I was like, oh, thanks. And then they respawned and they went back to do what they're doing.
[09:49.040 --> 09:54.620]  And I flipped over again 20 seconds later, but I was too embarrassed to admit it.
[09:54.980 --> 10:03.180]  So I just sat on my side for like 40 minutes until they were done their thing and then was like, hey, you want to come back? You want to flip me again?
[10:03.600 --> 10:06.580]  I've been stuck here because I don't know how to drive this.
[10:09.740 --> 10:13.300]  I have a question, Andrew. Andrew, you've been playing a little bit more trucks then?
[10:13.620 --> 10:18.280]  I have been. Yeah, I am. Next time we record trucks, I will be in a better place.
[10:18.280 --> 10:22.660]  Oh, that's awesome. Dude, that's really cool. I'm actually really happy to hear that.
[10:23.220 --> 10:26.060]  Geoff, you've been playing trucks too, right? Yeah, I play it every night.
[10:26.420 --> 10:28.260]  Oh, you play it every night? Andrew, you've been playing trucks with Geoff?
[10:28.820 --> 10:30.540]  I go to bed too early to play with Geoff.
[10:31.920 --> 10:36.100]  I invited... I found out a new annoying fact about our friend Andrew.
[10:36.680 --> 10:41.020]  I'm trying so fucking hard. I'm trying so hard at two things.
[10:41.020 --> 10:46.540]  I'm trying so hard to accommodate his schedules to get him into trucks with Burndog and Antonio.
[10:46.840 --> 10:50.360]  Because they're all going to love each other. And I think Gavin can attest to that.
[10:50.520 --> 10:51.860]  And Eric, for that matter. You know them both.
[10:52.340 --> 11:02.280]  And then secondly, I am trying so fucking hard not to take it personally that Andrew refuses to play trucks with me outside of work.
[11:02.280 --> 11:06.980]  I gave you three days, I will say. I go to bed early. You start when I go to bed.
[11:06.980 --> 11:08.780]  You're on the west coast.
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.540]  What time... guys, real fast. And Andrew, you did. And I'm going to try my best.
[11:14.960 --> 11:19.160]  I'm really looking forward to those three days in the future when we're supposedly going to try together.
[11:19.260 --> 11:24.300]  And I hope it happens. What time would you guys say is too late for Andrew to play trucks with me?
[11:26.280 --> 11:29.000]  10.45? Yeah, 11. Probably 11.
[11:29.520 --> 11:30.000]  8pm.
[11:30.400 --> 11:30.680]  What?
[11:32.620 --> 11:33.020]  8pm?
[11:33.300 --> 11:37.140]  He told me 8pm, his time is too late to play trucks with him.
[11:37.580 --> 11:39.260]  I hop into bed at like 8.15.
[11:40.100 --> 11:42.300]  What do you do for the next, like, four hours?
[11:43.740 --> 11:47.740]  If we want to get deep into this old man routine that I'm currently in, yes.
[11:47.880 --> 11:50.980]  Because you're surely winding down. You're not sleeping anyway.
[11:51.140 --> 11:57.360]  No, no, I'm winding down at 8, but I'm hopping into bed at around 8. Between 8 and 8.15, I'm climbing into bed.
[11:57.360 --> 12:03.540]  And my new thing is, and I'm embarrassed to say this, I've gotten deep into Turner Classic Movies channel.
[12:03.800 --> 12:05.680]  That's nothing embarrassing about that at all.
[12:05.840 --> 12:12.900]  I'm watching 1950s, 1960s movies in bed at 8pm and then falling asleep. I'm an old man.
[12:13.300 --> 12:15.240]  What was the last movie you watched?
[12:15.960 --> 12:23.480]  I don't remember the name. I came in late on a John Wayne film that was a remake, I guess, of the guy's last movie.
[12:23.480 --> 12:29.620]  But it was reverse. Where it was like the same cast, but John Wayne played the sheriff in the other one.
[12:29.720 --> 12:33.100]  And this time he played the drunk or something. I'm not really sure. I came in late on it.
[12:33.460 --> 12:36.900]  And I drifted off. But, oh, it was called El Dorado. I think.
[12:37.500 --> 12:38.420]  Are you watching them on TV?
[12:39.120 --> 12:45.680]  I'm watching them on TV. I'm opening my TV app, going to the Turner Classic Movie channel, and then just letting it run.
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.020]  Just whatever's happening.
[12:47.380 --> 12:50.760]  No, I love that you're doing this. By the way, there's nothing embarrassing about this.
[12:50.760 --> 12:55.360]  For one, old movies are fucking awesome. I pay for Criterion Collection just for this purpose.
[12:56.260 --> 12:58.740]  And two, I love that you're channel surfing, kinda.
[12:59.480 --> 13:03.660]  We've been talking about it a lot outside of work, and it feels almost like you're channel surfing.
[13:04.020 --> 13:08.800]  I realize that I don't necessarily enjoy doing all my own programming.
[13:09.300 --> 13:17.260]  I really like getting programmed, too. And the idea that I can throw on this thing that I know nothing about is exciting to me.
[13:17.260 --> 13:20.980]  But you could watch the whole movie if you pre-decided like an hour earlier.
[13:21.860 --> 13:25.520]  Yeah, but I didn't, so I just saw the end of it, and I'm perfectly happy with what I saw.
[13:25.700 --> 13:28.860]  And he didn't even know the movie existed until it randomly showed up.
[13:29.000 --> 13:29.140]  Yeah.
[13:29.140 --> 13:30.440]  And it was a pleasant surprise for him.
[13:30.820 --> 13:36.440]  It's kinda like how when you come over to my house, and we pop in cool vids on YouTube, and then we just see what happens.
[13:37.040 --> 13:39.280]  Yeah, it's really something.
[13:39.600 --> 13:41.080]  It's really something that happens.
[13:42.400 --> 13:44.200]  Happy New Year. Alright.
[13:44.200 --> 13:50.300]  I mean, I feel like you've just evolved on from what we used to do, which was watch Ridiculousness all the time.
[13:50.420 --> 13:56.000]  So, I feel like cool vids is our new Chanel West Coast-less video feed.
[13:56.260 --> 14:02.280]  I fucking saw a stat on Reddit the other day that apparently Ridiculousness is...
[14:03.140 --> 14:09.360]  MTV programs 24 hours a day, right? Ridiculousness is 21 hours a day of their programming.
[14:09.740 --> 14:10.900]  Yep. It's insane.
[14:12.960 --> 14:13.480]  What?
[14:13.900 --> 14:17.400]  It is the Ridiculousness channel now.
[14:17.840 --> 14:18.880]  What's the other three hours?
[14:19.660 --> 14:24.220]  Probably like the teen pregnancy show, Teen Mom, or I don't know.
[14:24.960 --> 14:25.460]  The teen pregnancy show.
[14:25.480 --> 14:30.660]  Or like Wild N' Out with Nick Cannon, or whatever other shows, The Challenge maybe, yeah.
[14:30.920 --> 14:36.820]  Whatever their three hours of prime time is probably, and then every other minute of that channel is Ridiculousness.
[14:36.820 --> 14:41.120]  Yeah, but those three hours of prime time is right when Andrew is settling in to go to bed.
[14:41.340 --> 14:44.020]  So, he's got to make a tough decision on what he wants to watch.
[14:44.220 --> 14:44.680]  That's true.
[14:45.940 --> 14:48.040]  Andrew, tonight at 6pm, Citizen Kane.
[14:48.720 --> 14:49.960]  Oh, have you ever seen it?
[14:50.260 --> 14:51.180]  I haven't.
[14:51.500 --> 14:53.520]  Hey, 9.15, Network.
[14:54.740 --> 14:59.300]  I've never seen Network, but I've seen it referenced my entire life. I want to know what it's all about.
[14:59.300 --> 15:08.140]  It's really good, and then also, it's definitely made in the 70s, so it's a weirdly paced movie, but very good.
[15:08.660 --> 15:11.240]  That's the I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore movie, right?
[15:11.320 --> 15:11.680]  Yup.
[15:14.600 --> 15:19.420]  Maybe we should start a new, you remember last year when I had that little run where I did movie reviews?
[15:20.220 --> 15:20.500]  Mhmm.
[15:21.040 --> 15:26.540]  Maybe 2024 could see a return, but it's Andrew reviewing TCM movies.
[15:26.540 --> 15:30.160]  I love it. I love it.
[15:30.320 --> 15:32.540]  And you'll review your Schwarzenegger movies.
[15:33.540 --> 15:34.760]  Yeah. Okay.
[15:35.540 --> 15:38.520]  Well, hey, Geoff, can you give us a review of Hello, Dolly or whatever?
[15:39.440 --> 15:42.320]  Oh, dude. Do you want to talk about Hello, Dolly?
[15:42.780 --> 15:45.800]  No, I just wanted you to do your review. I didn't want to talk about it.
[15:45.800 --> 15:55.500]  Fuck, man. I didn't really plan on making a review of the movie, but I will say I just saw it, and what an impression that film left on me.
[15:55.500 --> 16:04.960]  That, uh, you ever heard of Barbra Streisand? Delightful. Absolutely. I get it. Walter Matthau? I'd want to marry him, too.
[16:05.040 --> 16:08.760]  What an adorable little old curmudgeon he was. That was a fucking great movie.
[16:08.960 --> 16:12.520]  And Michael Crawford was the... holy shit, dude.
[16:12.680 --> 16:13.820]  Oh, dude. Condor Man?
[16:14.840 --> 16:22.680]  Condor Man. Michael Crawford is like, he plays Cornelius, I think his name is, and he's basically Dick Van Dyke the entire film.
[16:22.680 --> 16:29.620]  Just tripping over stuff, and he's like a cartoon. He's Jim Carrey before Jim Carrey. He's just, like, all goof.
[16:29.940 --> 16:32.160]  Is he English in it, or American? He's American in it.
[16:32.480 --> 16:35.900]  Oh, okay. And he sings the entire... I mean, it's a musical, right? So he sings the entire movie.
[16:36.220 --> 16:40.400]  In all seriousness, though, fucking awesome, awesome film. Really, really good.
[16:40.800 --> 16:43.600]  Do you remember the name of the sitcom he was in in the 70s?
[16:43.700 --> 16:46.340]  Yeah, Some Mothers Gotta Have Him. That's very close.
[16:46.860 --> 16:49.560]  What was it? Some Mothers Do Have Him.
[16:49.840 --> 16:51.040]  Oh, Some Mothers Do Have Him.
[16:52.940 --> 16:55.460]  I did not expect you to remember.
[16:56.180 --> 17:05.260]  Now that I've seen him in Condor Man and Hello, Dolly! and a couple of bits of clips that you showed me in that, what an interesting career that dude had.
[17:05.980 --> 17:10.720]  Do you think that this is the number one Michael Crawford appreciation podcast?
[17:11.540 --> 17:12.060]  I hope so.
[17:12.280 --> 17:18.080]  Well, I feel like he's come up naturally so many times. Like, I think he came up through Condor Man and Phantom of the Opera separately.
[17:18.080 --> 17:20.200]  Oh, right. He was in Phantom as well.
[17:20.700 --> 17:21.740]  He was THE Phantom.
[17:22.120 --> 17:29.240]  I think we're... I think... Oh, what... Like, you know how the Taylor Swift are called Swifties?
[17:29.740 --> 17:31.940]  Maybe we're Crawford Stans. What are we?
[17:32.060 --> 17:33.940]  Little Crawlies? Creepy Crawlies?
[17:34.240 --> 17:35.520]  Are we Crawdaddies?
[17:35.680 --> 17:39.800]  Oh, Crawdads is exactly the words out of my mouth, Geoff.
[17:40.100 --> 17:42.240]  I think we're Crawdads.
[17:42.240 --> 17:56.980]  If you look him up, movies and shows, some mothers do have him. Hello, Dolly! Condor Man. Condor Man is listed third? Third? Wow.
[17:57.420 --> 17:58.960]  It's almost like a perfect career.
[17:59.800 --> 18:03.360]  That's awesome. That's so cool.
[18:04.120 --> 18:08.040]  Alright, I gotta get on the Arnold Schwarzenegger thing. Seriously though, everybody should watch Hello, Dolly!
[18:08.040 --> 18:11.780]  There's a ten minute dance scene called the Waiter's Gallop that's so fucking cool.
[18:11.960 --> 18:19.060]  Did you have a movie as a kid? Well, it doesn't necessarily have to be as a kid. A movie that you liked, but there was always a part that you would fast forward?
[18:20.700 --> 18:22.720]  Yeah, Turner and Hooch, When the Dog Dies.
[18:23.820 --> 18:26.260]  Oh, so you're trying to avoid the sadness.
[18:26.800 --> 18:29.420]  Yeah, I would watch it at my grandma's house.
[18:29.520 --> 18:36.300]  My grandma would tell me when I was little and the movie would be on, I would take her hand and make her go into the kitchen.
[18:37.500 --> 18:39.680]  Because I would just go, this is the sad part.
[18:41.340 --> 18:43.040]  Do you think you can handle it now?
[18:43.880 --> 18:46.920]  Yeah, but I don't think I think I would cry. I think I would genuinely cry.
[18:47.640 --> 18:48.780]  Can we film you watch it?
[18:49.760 --> 18:52.020]  No! Why would we want to see me cry?
[18:52.440 --> 18:53.580]  Maybe we should get personal.
[18:54.960 --> 19:00.700]  What? This is awful. Why would you want to, you want to see, you want to watch me commit it to film?
[19:01.040 --> 19:01.900]  Watch me cry?
[19:02.300 --> 19:06.120]  I've just never seen you have an emotion that wasn't anger. So I'm just wondering what the range is.
[19:07.080 --> 19:11.720]  I have, I have most of, if not all the emotions.
[19:11.960 --> 19:15.200]  He's got anger and thinking about anger.
[19:16.800 --> 19:24.120]  Yeah, anger and preheating the oven for anger. I used to always, I used to watch Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory all the time.
[19:24.700 --> 19:32.000]  But there's this part where Charlie's mom just starts singing on her own. And it was so dog shit. I would always skip that part.
[19:32.000 --> 19:42.040]  I would skip scenes in Terminator and Aliens and Poltergeist because they were too scary. So I would fast forward through that.
[19:42.300 --> 19:51.240]  That makes sense. Gracie said that it's an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants when the animated butterfly turns real and buzzed really aggressively.
[19:51.240 --> 19:52.160]  Oh, wow.
[19:54.640 --> 19:58.020]  And then sent us a picture of this fucking thing.
[19:58.020 --> 19:58.580]  Ew.
[20:02.020 --> 20:05.160]  Episode Wormy. For anyone interested.
[20:06.500 --> 20:08.520]  Oh, man. Gross.
[20:09.340 --> 20:12.420]  So I guess this is a movie review podcast now, huh?
[20:13.740 --> 20:14.540]  I guess.
[20:14.780 --> 20:17.800]  We're 21 minutes in, all we've talked. What'd you say? You're gonna go see Beekeeper?
[20:18.240 --> 20:19.220]  Yeah, I'm gonna go see Beekeeper.
[20:19.920 --> 20:21.860]  Oh, that's exciting. Are you, do you think it's gonna be good?
[20:23.040 --> 20:23.440]  No.
[20:24.820 --> 20:28.040]  I'm gonna go see Iron Claw tonight with Millie.
[20:28.400 --> 20:29.280]  Are you really?
[20:29.780 --> 20:35.820]  Yeah. What a cool kid, by the way. I was like, hey, let's go have a daddy-daughter date. Let's go out and watch, go to a movie you pick.
[20:35.880 --> 20:40.440]  Whatever you want to see. And I figured she'd want to see, I don't know, I didn't, the last thing I thought she'd want to see is Iron Claw.
[20:41.240 --> 20:45.600]  But she likes The Bear. So she wanted to see the kid from The Bear and Shameless in it.
[20:46.640 --> 20:54.500]  I'll let you know, he's not in it a lot, but he is, he's definitely in it. And, oh boy, what a story.
[20:55.460 --> 20:59.320]  Is it gonna be a fun story to watch with my 18-year-old daughter?
[20:59.720 --> 21:05.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me know, let me know how you guys feel coming out of it. Shoot me a text when you're done seeing it.
[21:05.060 --> 21:06.420]  Oh God, Millie and I have to...
[21:06.420 --> 21:06.620]  Isn't it true?
[21:07.300 --> 21:07.580]  Yes.
[21:07.820 --> 21:08.920]  Is there a lot of sex stuff?
[21:09.220 --> 21:09.580]  No.
[21:10.180 --> 21:10.720]  Okay, good.
[21:11.300 --> 21:11.620]  Nope.
[21:12.160 --> 21:12.480]  Okay.
[21:12.480 --> 21:13.840]  Who gets more uncomfortable?
[21:14.720 --> 21:16.200]  Who, who gets, Millie or I?
[21:16.680 --> 21:16.900]  Yeah.
[21:17.320 --> 21:24.700]  Oh, it's immediate. I think Millie and I are very similar in a lot of ways, and I think we're very similar on the embarrassment scale. I think it's 50-50.
[21:25.380 --> 21:34.080]  We never, we couldn't finish the last season of The Boys because we knew there was a scene coming up and we just didn't, we didn't want to get to the scene to even have to stop.
[21:36.520 --> 21:37.260]  That's amazing.
[21:37.260 --> 21:44.220]  Yeah, it's not, it's not like a sex thing. It's definitely just like the saddest story. It's just sad.
[21:44.440 --> 21:44.600]  Okay.
[21:44.800 --> 21:45.020]  Yeah.
[21:45.780 --> 21:48.260]  Oh man, Millie's, Millie is a crier at movies too.
[21:48.540 --> 21:49.900]  Oh, then it's, yeah, it's gonna be brutal.
[21:49.940 --> 21:51.580]  Oh, so am I though. Ah, shit.
[21:51.960 --> 21:52.600]  Andrew, you alright?
[21:53.540 --> 21:54.020]  I'm good.
[21:55.280 --> 21:57.680]  You have been, you have muted for a long time there.
[21:58.540 --> 22:01.340]  Yeah, I wasn't feeling too good, so I had to step away for a minute, but I'm good.
[22:01.600 --> 22:02.400]  What, did you, huh?
[22:03.240 --> 22:04.460]  Yeah, I did, but I'm good.
[22:04.760 --> 22:05.080]  What?
[22:05.940 --> 22:07.440]  Why didn't you throw up on mic?
[22:07.440 --> 22:08.220]  Why didn't we just stop?
[22:09.540 --> 22:11.420]  Why, why didn't you throw up on mic?
[22:12.520 --> 22:15.240]  If you didn't throw up, bring the microphone with you.
[22:15.360 --> 22:17.280]  Don't bring the microphone. No, no, no, no, no.
[22:17.740 --> 22:22.520]  I was on anti, I'm on antibiotics right now, and it's, I think messing with my system a little bit, so.
[22:22.540 --> 22:24.900]  Well, not anymore. They're in the, they're in the toilet at the moment.
[22:26.120 --> 22:26.540]  But I'm good.
[22:27.320 --> 22:29.700]  What was the last time, what were we talking about? Crying movies? Emotional movies?
[22:29.700 --> 22:30.940]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[22:31.240 --> 22:32.040]  What did you last hear?
[22:32.660 --> 22:33.220]  Wait, did you?
[22:33.300 --> 22:33.740]  I don't know.
[22:33.740 --> 22:35.600]  Were you recording? Were you recording the whole time?
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.020]  No, I muted my mic, but I kept it rolling.
[22:38.580 --> 22:42.640]  No, no, but yeah, you're, so your, so your recorded track has you puking in it.
[22:43.100 --> 22:44.920]  No, it's just, it's everything's muted.
[22:46.780 --> 22:47.420]  Thank God.
[22:48.700 --> 22:49.320]  I'm disappointed.
[22:49.940 --> 22:50.640]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[22:51.280 --> 22:53.060]  Sorry you're sick, but, you know.
[22:53.360 --> 22:58.560]  I was trying my best, just holding it out for as long as I could, and I didn't want to make a scene, so I just put it in the chat. I have to step away for a moment.
[22:59.960 --> 23:01.340]  Oh, did you write it? I didn't even see that.
[23:01.380 --> 23:01.780]  I did.
[23:02.460 --> 23:03.180]  Oh, wow.
[23:03.440 --> 23:04.200]  Oh, he did.
[23:04.320 --> 23:05.720]  You've been gone seven minutes.
[23:06.720 --> 23:09.180]  Yeah, it wasn't a fun time, but I'm back. I'm good.
[23:10.260 --> 23:11.580]  We're talking about crying movies?
[23:12.260 --> 23:16.720]  Well, I was asking if there was a movie that you enjoyed when you were younger that you had a part that you always skipped.
[23:18.660 --> 23:20.440]  Oh, that's a really interesting question.
[23:20.620 --> 23:23.660]  And I picked Willy Wonka when the mum starts singing about Charlie.
[23:25.000 --> 23:25.400]  Boring.
[23:26.040 --> 23:26.440]  Boring?
[23:27.040 --> 23:27.260]  Yeah.
[23:28.340 --> 23:38.480]  I don't know if I've ever skipped a scene like that. Have you ever cried in a movie so bad that you had to try to gather yourself because you were embarrassed by the amount you were crying?
[23:38.960 --> 23:39.180]  Up.
[23:39.440 --> 23:39.840]  Up?
[23:40.360 --> 23:42.660]  The first five minutes of Up, I had to leave.
[23:42.680 --> 23:44.120]  Oh, yeah, it's a crusher.
[23:44.360 --> 23:45.260]  I was like...
[23:47.560 --> 23:54.700]  People were looking at me when she fell down, when she fucking took a knee. Oh, my God, dude. Oh, my fucking God.
[23:55.780 --> 23:56.420]  It's brutal.
[23:56.420 --> 24:02.640]  I just sat outside the theater and cried for a little while. It was kind of like when we went to Amsterdam, Gavin.
[24:05.080 --> 24:11.240]  I think I saw Up three times in theaters and I cried every time in the beginning. It didn't get easier.
[24:11.840 --> 24:13.880]  I would cry right now if I thought about it too hard.
[24:14.960 --> 24:22.480]  It's so funny to me that on TikTok, people use the music from that sequence in a pleasant way and it ruins whatever that video is for me.
[24:22.560 --> 24:22.820]  Yeah.
[24:22.820 --> 24:30.340]  I associate it as sadness, no matter what. Even though it's uplifting music, it is associated with something incredibly difficult.
[24:30.800 --> 24:36.960]  Hey, can I tell you guys a really brief, uplifting story? And then, Andrew, I want to talk dentistry after that.
[24:37.100 --> 24:38.120]  Okay, yeah, no, we got to.
[24:39.660 --> 24:42.400]  So you guys know I have a puppy dog now, right? Little bulldog?
[24:43.340 --> 24:43.860]  Yeah, already.
[24:44.320 --> 24:52.800]  Do you remember...
[24:52.800 --> 24:56.600]  There was just a constant parade of dog shit everywhere at all times.
[24:57.300 --> 24:57.440]  Yeah.
[24:57.880 --> 25:01.540]  Man, I must be magnetized to dog shit.
[25:02.180 --> 25:05.060]  The other day, I didn't even get a chance to tell you guys.
[25:05.280 --> 25:08.860]  But I think I told Andrew, but I didn't tell you guys because we got distracted.
[25:09.000 --> 25:15.680]  But when we sat down to record the last episode of F*** Face, when I sat down to do my mic checks and stuff, I just sat down in my chair, Indian style.
[25:15.680 --> 25:19.040]  And I started working, checking, setting up the mic and everything. And I looked, I smelled something a little weird.
[25:19.080 --> 25:22.540]  I looked down, there was just dog shit all up and down my leg, on the inside of my pants.
[25:22.540 --> 25:24.440]  I don't know where it came from or how it got there.
[25:24.600 --> 25:26.220]  That's why I had to run and change pants real fast.
[25:27.380 --> 25:29.720]  Night before last, I took...
[25:30.900 --> 25:33.040]  I took Henry out. Or not Henry, sorry.
[25:33.280 --> 25:35.440]  I took the other dog, the new dog out. Henry's dead.
[25:35.940 --> 25:38.760]  I took the new puppy out to go potty.
[25:39.100 --> 25:40.660]  And he went out and it was dark, right?
[25:40.760 --> 25:43.980]  Like it was so late. And I have like lights out in my backyard.
[25:44.140 --> 25:46.280]  But after midnight or whatever, they turn off.
[25:46.820 --> 25:48.640]  And so it was dark and I just sat him on the ground.
[25:48.680 --> 25:50.640]  And he went out and I saw him squat and pee and poop or whatever.
[25:50.640 --> 25:52.880]  And then he came back to me and I picked him up.
[25:52.980 --> 25:55.740]  And I was walking through the house and the house was all dark because we were going to bed.
[25:55.900 --> 26:00.280]  But Emily was working on the computer doing some clutch my pearls stuff.
[26:00.800 --> 26:04.320]  And I walked over to her and I was cradling the puppy and holding him.
[26:04.520 --> 26:07.520]  And she's like, oh give me the baby. And so I gave him to her and she cradled him.
[26:08.120 --> 26:11.580]  I walked into the bedroom and I started to get undressed.
[26:11.820 --> 26:14.140]  And I looked, I turned the light on and I looked down.
[26:14.560 --> 26:17.620]  And there was just dog diarrhea all on my shirt.
[26:18.080 --> 26:19.640]  And I was like horrified.
[26:19.640 --> 26:26.280]  I had just seen it and right as I saw it, I heard Emily screaming from the other end of the house.
[26:26.720 --> 26:30.800]  And she just came running and I guess I had handed her a dog covered in poopy diarrhea.
[26:31.360 --> 26:37.140]  And we had both just like cuddled him and caressed the doo doo into our clothes.
[26:37.780 --> 26:40.900]  And it was pretty gross.
[26:41.600 --> 26:43.120]  Has he got a bit of a yucky tummy at the moment?
[26:43.480 --> 26:46.800]  He's fine. He's fine. I think that he had a little bit of a yucky tummy that day.
[26:47.000 --> 26:47.300]  But he's fine.
[26:47.300 --> 26:47.640]  Who's fine?
[26:47.640 --> 26:48.700]  The puppy.
[26:50.200 --> 26:50.640]  Dammit.
[26:51.700 --> 26:56.340]  Are you sure when you sat cross-legged and there was shit on your leg, it's from the dog?
[26:56.660 --> 26:59.020]  Yeah, it was dog doo doo. I'm quite familiar with it.
[26:59.440 --> 26:59.640]  You're sure?
[26:59.640 --> 27:00.040]  I'm pretty sure.
[27:00.380 --> 27:00.940]  You're sure?
[27:02.040 --> 27:02.480]  100%.
[27:03.320 --> 27:05.040]  I'm just checking. I'm just asking.
[27:06.300 --> 27:10.880]  Anyway, that's my covered myself in dog shit story for this week.
[27:11.340 --> 27:12.900]  I'm sure there'll be another one next week.
[27:12.900 --> 27:17.640]  Oh, we got countless content of you and shit in the near future.
[27:18.460 --> 27:22.100]  We got potentially 500 weeks worth of potential shit stories.
[27:22.460 --> 27:22.980]  It's true.
[27:23.200 --> 27:27.180]  You got about 11 more years of it before he kicks the bucket.
[27:28.180 --> 27:32.240]  Speaking of ongoing stories that Geoff has, I went to the dentist.
[27:32.840 --> 27:38.260]  I haven't been to the dentist in a while. Probably like 12 years was the last time I went to the dentist.
[27:38.680 --> 27:38.820]  Oh my god.
[27:39.260 --> 27:40.000]  It's been a long time.
[27:40.580 --> 27:42.080]  My old dentist retired.
[27:44.660 --> 27:49.260]  As a contractor, I don't have insurance. My old one retired. There's anxiety about it.
[27:49.660 --> 27:55.620]  As I said before, this is the year of self-care for me. Sort of my general goal, so I went.
[27:57.740 --> 28:03.080]  Did you follow your old dentist to the old folks home and it's the same old folks home where you get your hair cut?
[28:03.240 --> 28:08.840]  There is not a dentistry office in that old folks home, or otherwise I would have.
[28:08.840 --> 28:15.000]  So I had to find an entirely new dentist, which is a process within itself, but I found one.
[28:15.340 --> 28:19.720]  I've been dealing with some tooth issues for a while now, and I finally got everything checked out.
[28:20.180 --> 28:24.160]  Did the x-rays and all that went great. It was a really good experience. It was an awesome time.
[28:24.360 --> 28:26.580]  I just got to hang out and watch Spongebob. It was great.
[28:27.020 --> 28:28.280]  There's a kid, I guess, before me.
[28:28.660 --> 28:29.300]  No worms.
[28:30.440 --> 28:31.320]  Zero worms.
[28:32.360 --> 28:36.240]  But I do have to get two root canals done.
[28:36.240 --> 28:42.060]  And after all of Geoff's stories, it's an intimidating process.
[28:42.280 --> 28:49.040]  I mean, that also didn't help in me avoiding going. Having to hear the horrors of Geoff for like a year straight.
[28:49.620 --> 28:50.520]  Of all these different things.
[28:50.940 --> 28:53.740]  Well, can I ease your pain just a little bit?
[28:54.100 --> 28:54.300]  Absolutely.
[28:54.300 --> 29:00.540]  Just give you a ray of hope. I didn't tell anybody this, but I went to the dentist last week for my teeth cleaning and checkup.
[29:01.420 --> 29:02.840]  And my teeth are great.
[29:03.140 --> 29:03.520]  Great!
[29:03.940 --> 29:07.060]  And I was in and out in 30 minutes. And they did nothing to me.
[29:07.360 --> 29:10.080]  So you might have a future like that very soon, Andrew.
[29:10.300 --> 29:12.680]  It's not just the root canals, too, though. You have to get some fillings as well?
[29:13.120 --> 29:15.700]  Yep. Fillings, root canals, all that fun stuff.
[29:16.060 --> 29:20.200]  So like, yeah. Three years from now, based on your timeline, I'll be all good.
[29:20.740 --> 29:25.780]  But what really cracked me up is, so they do the x-rays and they go through the process.
[29:26.020 --> 29:28.420]  And they're like, this tooth needs this, blah, blah, blah.
[29:28.520 --> 29:30.020]  And then they explain it to you at the end.
[29:30.020 --> 29:33.180]  And they explained everything and said like, oh, you're going to need two root canals.
[29:33.440 --> 29:38.620]  And at the very end, they looked at me and they said, I don't know if you know what a root canal is.
[29:38.740 --> 29:40.360]  And then they went into explaining it.
[29:40.480 --> 29:47.720]  And internally, it was so hard not to laugh, being like, I have listened to three years of content about the horrors of root canals.
[29:47.860 --> 29:52.340]  If there's anyone who is informed on root canals without having one, it is me.
[29:52.680 --> 29:56.920]  So I am locked in and excited to go through this process.
[29:57.000 --> 29:59.200]  And we can share notes, Geoff, of what our experiences are like.
[29:59.200 --> 30:05.040]  Can I give you three pieces of really good, really salient advice right now?
[30:05.660 --> 30:05.880]  No.
[30:06.700 --> 30:08.600]  Anyway, Gavin, proceed.
[30:09.180 --> 30:09.320]  I'll take the advice.
[30:09.320 --> 30:11.540]  No, I want to hear the advice. I'm kidding, obviously.
[30:11.940 --> 30:12.380]  Please do.
[30:13.100 --> 30:18.800]  I think I've said this on the podcast before, but when they nub your mouth up, get extra shots.
[30:19.340 --> 30:21.080]  Tell them you can still feel it, even if they don't.
[30:21.940 --> 30:23.560]  It'll pay dividends later.
[30:23.560 --> 30:30.520]  It'll also keep your mouth number longer so that when it starts to eventually wake up at home, you get just a little bit more of a reprieve.
[30:30.900 --> 30:36.420]  And I would be very, very... get Novacaine or get Nitrous if they offer it.
[30:36.800 --> 30:41.100]  You definitely want it. It'll make your life a lot easier. It'll make it a lot easier not to focus on the pain.
[30:42.140 --> 30:44.500]  And then the other one is just be aware.
[30:44.620 --> 30:45.600]  This is just a little bit of advice.
[30:45.600 --> 30:54.680]  Just be aware. About half of the root canals I had ended in me having to see a root canal doctor called an endodontist.
[30:55.420 --> 31:04.100]  A lot of dentists do root canals, but if it goes squirrely in any way whatsoever, they're going to patch you up and send you to an endodontist.
[31:04.180 --> 31:09.080]  So just be prepared that that's a potentiality that you might have to deal with.
[31:09.200 --> 31:10.360]  Nick's dad was an endodontist.
[31:10.520 --> 31:13.740]  It's basically a dentist who does root canals all day long.
[31:15.380 --> 31:16.800]  Specifically root canals all day long.
[31:17.220 --> 31:23.920]  And so they have special tools. They have stronger tools. They have more access to handle more difficult issues.
[31:24.120 --> 31:30.160]  And so just be aware of that. Don't be freaked out if they get halfway through after three hours in your mouth and then go,
[31:30.240 --> 31:33.760]  Okay, I'm going to plug this up and then I'm going to have to send you to see a specialist.
[31:34.140 --> 31:34.440]  That's it.
[31:34.980 --> 31:36.500]  Okay, great. That is great advice.
[31:36.580 --> 31:38.660]  Why wouldn't you go to an endodontist first?
[31:39.040 --> 31:39.380]  You could.
[31:40.360 --> 31:40.600]  Oh.
[31:42.080 --> 31:44.740]  I assume it's more expensive to go to a specialist.
[31:44.900 --> 31:48.920]  I feel like whenever you see a specialist, it'll increase the cost.
[31:49.320 --> 31:51.100]  It's possible. Yeah, it's possible.
[31:51.580 --> 31:55.280]  When I was dealing with all those issues, I was always in so much pain.
[31:55.400 --> 31:57.780]  I was just like, I'll pay anything. I don't care.
[31:58.380 --> 31:58.760]  Oh, yeah.
[31:58.840 --> 32:02.240]  I won't even look at the receipt. Just take my money and make it go away.
[32:03.000 --> 32:07.580]  And I will say, as someone who doesn't have insurance, it was a lot cheaper than I anticipated, which was nice.
[32:08.160 --> 32:08.580]  That's great.
[32:08.580 --> 32:12.380]  Well, Canada has some form of national health care system, right?
[32:12.920 --> 32:18.320]  Not for dentistry. They just enacted a plan for dentistry this year, and it's still super limited.
[32:18.700 --> 32:25.480]  So going forward, you'll have access to basic cleanings and checkups and all that stuff will be covered under the plan.
[32:25.620 --> 32:27.180]  But previously to this, no.
[32:27.700 --> 32:28.100]  That's great.
[32:28.160 --> 32:30.260]  Just general medical coverage.
[32:30.260 --> 32:33.400]  Do we have a physicist update? Have you got hold of anyone?
[32:33.400 --> 32:39.080]  No, shockingly, nobody's replied. Bill Nye did not respond to the tweet, which is a disappointment.
[32:39.580 --> 32:42.120]  But, you know, I don't even know.
[32:42.580 --> 32:43.780]  Go ahead.
[32:44.200 --> 32:52.460]  The comments on this standing desk problem are blowing my mind.
[32:53.080 --> 32:54.700]  Yeah, you seem annoyed by some of them.
[32:55.180 --> 32:58.800]  I don't understand how hard it is for people to understand the concept.
[32:59.120 --> 33:01.600]  Someone wrote, I won't name them and shame them.
[33:01.600 --> 33:10.320]  If you line up 10 cars bumper to bumper and they all travel at one mile an hour and Gavin is strapped to the front of the lead car, Gavin would travel at one mile an hour.
[33:11.180 --> 33:12.260]  Yeah, that's true.
[33:12.580 --> 33:15.600]  That's also nothing like what the experiment is.
[33:16.180 --> 33:17.640]  That's completely different.
[33:17.860 --> 33:18.300]  Also true.
[33:19.000 --> 33:22.840]  If I was juggling three balls, all balls would be juggling three balls.
[33:22.900 --> 33:23.420]  That's the same.
[33:23.600 --> 33:24.800]  It's a completely different experiment.
[33:26.280 --> 33:30.120]  Okay, but what if you were strapped to the front of the car while juggling the three balls?
[33:30.680 --> 33:34.100]  It would be harder to juggle, but once again, a completely different scenario.
[33:35.900 --> 33:41.160]  So you haven't been swayed into this is, you're wrong by any of the comments you've seen so far.
[33:41.480 --> 33:48.360]  I'll be honest, I thought it would be an overwhelming amount of people agreeing with me, which I feel like there are. There's a ton.
[33:48.880 --> 33:49.800]  Yeah, for sure.
[33:50.100 --> 33:54.080]  I'm now wondering how I even explained it because some people are so confused.
[33:54.720 --> 33:55.980]  You explained it pretty clearly.
[33:55.980 --> 34:05.120]  As a matter of fact, somebody in the subreddit made an animated gif of it in action, and it makes perfect sense.
[34:05.220 --> 34:07.560]  And you can just go look at that animated gif to understand what's happening.
[34:08.060 --> 34:09.600]  You know what I'm talking about? Did you see that?
[34:10.560 --> 34:11.460]  I haven't seen that.
[34:11.820 --> 34:12.000]  No.
[34:12.660 --> 34:23.280]  I also saw a comment that said that I should have said all the desks were motorized, racing with their motors, instead of magically moving at one mile an hour.
[34:24.140 --> 34:27.260]  Sorry for not specifying that no magic was involved.
[34:27.500 --> 34:28.800]  Yeah, I mean...
[34:28.800 --> 34:31.120]  Sorry, I'm getting really wrapped up about something.
[34:34.180 --> 34:36.280]  Yeah, I mean, it is what it is.
[34:36.740 --> 34:40.180]  That animation is absolutely it. That's exactly what I'm picturing.
[34:40.420 --> 34:40.580]  Yeah.
[34:41.340 --> 34:50.020]  You say no magic is involved. If I walked into a room where there were ten desks stacked on top of each other and a hot dog on top, I'm thinking something magical happened.
[34:50.020 --> 34:52.920]  I'm putting that in the magical department.
[34:53.900 --> 34:55.520]  I'm probably leaving the building.
[34:55.760 --> 34:57.760]  Gracie, where do you stand on this now?
[34:57.940 --> 35:00.420]  Gavin, I can't keep talking about this.
[35:00.720 --> 35:02.460]  But what have you read about it?
[35:03.240 --> 35:08.240]  I mean, I will say something defended me in the fact that the motors aren't going to work.
[35:09.220 --> 35:11.320]  That was irrelevant of the scenario.
[35:11.600 --> 35:12.140]  Yeah, it was.
[35:12.540 --> 35:14.780]  Because if we're actually going to put this to the test, that's going to happen.
[35:14.780 --> 35:20.700]  All right, if you put it to the test, we'll stick the first desk on its side against a wall and we'll have them all go out sideways.
[35:21.140 --> 35:25.400]  What Gavin is saying is he's going to magic the desk so they work the way that he wants them to.
[35:25.640 --> 35:27.300]  No, just put a stronger motor on.
[35:31.260 --> 35:32.300]  Yeah, I mean...
[35:32.300 --> 35:35.480]  Geez, I didn't mean to shut the podcast down with one fucking suggestion.
[35:35.820 --> 35:36.980]  I didn't know what he had. I mean, nothing.
[35:37.500 --> 35:42.840]  I mean, they make stronger motors. We also don't know how strong the motor on a standing desk is. It might be plenty strong.
[35:42.940 --> 35:44.680]  I don't think it's that strong.
[35:45.160 --> 35:46.980]  But it was more about the theory of the problem.
[35:46.980 --> 35:52.600]  I mean, yes, a bog-standard standing desk motor might not be able to support nine other desks.
[35:52.800 --> 35:54.980]  But in theory...
[35:56.020 --> 36:02.060]  You know those Nerf launchers where you pump the rocket and then you hit the thing and then it launches up?
[36:02.460 --> 36:04.620]  Is there a standing desk equivalent to that?
[36:05.080 --> 36:07.580]  Can we pump the power up and then just launch them?
[36:08.500 --> 36:10.280]  Because I didn't even know standing desks had a motor.
[36:11.380 --> 36:12.920]  How do you think they stand?
[36:13.300 --> 36:16.520]  I just assumed that they would lock into place, like it was bracketed.
[36:16.520 --> 36:17.940]  What, you'd like lift them?
[36:18.540 --> 36:24.680]  So, like, you've got your computer and all your printer and all your heavy shit on it and then you just like...
[36:24.680 --> 36:26.360]  Lift it up and somebody like...
[36:26.360 --> 36:29.260]  When you say it like that, yeah, it makes sense that it's motorized.
[36:29.360 --> 36:32.840]  They just have never had one and haven't really thought about standing desks.
[36:32.920 --> 36:35.820]  Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, it would need a motor. It's a good point.
[36:36.040 --> 36:36.600]  Or a pump.
[36:37.360 --> 36:40.140]  Gracie said, I need this conversation to end indefinitely.
[36:40.400 --> 36:42.440]  It's never, ever gonna...
[36:42.440 --> 36:44.240]  Welcome, hey, welcome to podcasts.
[36:45.740 --> 36:48.400]  For the rest of your life, you're never getting away with this one.
[36:48.880 --> 36:49.880]  That's the worst news.
[36:52.920 --> 36:56.280]  Plus, you need to be focused on your croutons more than anything.
[36:57.120 --> 36:59.440]  Oh, the crouton off. I'm excited about this.
[36:59.980 --> 37:03.420]  We're gonna have to push it till next week, right? Because we're not doing the apples tomorrow?
[37:03.520 --> 37:05.400]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, so we're gonna have to...
[37:05.400 --> 37:11.720]  We'll find a day after this, we'll figure it out, but we'll find a day next week where we can get croutons.
[37:11.720 --> 37:17.840]  And then we have... I have a box of, at this point, 28 apples from Cosmic Crisps sitting in my house.
[37:17.840 --> 37:19.220]  Hell yeah. Hell yeah.
[37:19.980 --> 37:27.180]  Yeah, I think the idea Eric presented is we all come over to my house and we each make our own apple pie using the Cosmic Crisps.
[37:27.400 --> 37:29.740]  But, don't get too excited. Hold on, hold on, Nick.
[37:30.300 --> 37:32.300]  But, nobody can use a recipe.
[37:33.360 --> 37:34.820]  We just have to figure it out.
[37:34.980 --> 37:35.900]  We'll just figure it out.
[37:36.260 --> 37:37.380]  Oh, I wouldn't know what to do.
[37:37.700 --> 37:41.180]  Yeah, exactly. I also think we should make applesauce, because I don't know how to make applesauce.
[37:41.180 --> 37:43.240]  But it seems like it would be easy, I think.
[37:43.600 --> 37:46.240]  You just have to smush apples. We just need an apple smusher.
[37:46.460 --> 37:49.060]  Oh, no, you can fuck... I followed a recipe.
[37:49.380 --> 37:51.160]  I've made applesauce once in my life.
[37:51.600 --> 37:52.500]  And I followed a recipe.
[37:53.020 --> 37:54.940]  And I misread teaspoon for tablespoon.
[37:55.540 --> 37:59.400]  And I put a tablespoon of cinnamon in, instead of a teaspoon of cinnamon.
[38:00.060 --> 38:02.020]  And, uh, it turned bright orange.
[38:02.680 --> 38:05.560]  And, uh, I ate it for quite a while going, well, this wasn't very good.
[38:05.700 --> 38:07.320]  And then I explained what I had done.
[38:07.800 --> 38:09.540]  And, uh, don't use a teaspoon.
[38:09.540 --> 38:11.760]  Cinnamon, very overpowering.
[38:11.760 --> 38:13.760]  Is a tablespoon two teaspoons?
[38:14.520 --> 38:15.780]  I'm not a spoon guy, I don't know.
[38:16.000 --> 38:16.240]  Oh.
[38:16.860 --> 38:17.920]  Consult someone else.
[38:20.140 --> 38:21.560]  Why did it turn orange?
[38:22.360 --> 38:25.760]  I, it just, whatever the brownish, like, you know, the color of cinnamon.
[38:26.120 --> 38:26.860]  That, that shape.
[38:27.080 --> 38:30.040]  There was so much cinnamon in it compared to anything else.
[38:30.500 --> 38:32.320]  That it shifted the tone.
[38:32.800 --> 38:33.220]  The shade.
[38:33.740 --> 38:36.360]  That'll be fun. We could create regulation applesauce.
[38:36.460 --> 38:37.020]  That'd be great.
[38:37.020 --> 38:38.240]  Three teaspoons, okay.
[38:38.560 --> 38:39.760]  I'm a big fan of applesauce.
[38:40.100 --> 38:42.640]  We have plenty of Cosmic Crisps to do it.
[38:42.760 --> 38:45.740]  As they have sponsored us, and then went, here's a bunch of apples.
[38:46.000 --> 38:46.480]  It's so great.
[38:47.140 --> 38:47.620]  Thank God.
[38:47.960 --> 38:51.100]  Eric was funny too, because he was like, we were talking about this earlier today.
[38:51.140 --> 38:52.100]  And he was like, yeah, I was kind of freaking out.
[38:52.120 --> 38:55.640]  Because I thought, I thought, uh, oh shit, we have to cancel tomorrow.
[38:55.720 --> 38:56.360]  Because Gavin can't make it.
[38:56.400 --> 38:57.580]  And he was like, uh, what am I going to do with all these apples?
[38:57.660 --> 38:59.100]  And then I realized, oh right, they keep for a year.
[38:59.980 --> 39:02.220]  Yeah, these apples are going to be just fine.
[39:02.260 --> 39:02.960]  They're not going anywhere.
[39:02.960 --> 39:04.080]  I love them so much.
[39:04.120 --> 39:06.260]  I finally got the ad copy for Cosmic Crisp.
[39:06.340 --> 39:09.560]  And it's just, it's filled with, uh, f***face references naturally.
[39:09.680 --> 39:10.180]  Is it really?
[39:10.560 --> 39:11.000]  Yeah.
[39:11.260 --> 39:13.240]  If I can pull it up, I will.
[39:13.240 --> 39:14.820]  Is that Kent's doing, or did they come up with that?
[39:14.960 --> 39:15.860]  I don't know.
[39:16.140 --> 39:17.800]  Oh, I think it's, I think it's them.
[39:17.880 --> 39:19.500]  Did you see their tweet from the other day?
[39:19.560 --> 39:20.180]  I did.
[39:20.960 --> 39:27.240]  Where they tweeted a picture of their apple, and called it a regulation apple.
[39:28.260 --> 39:28.820]  That's great.
[39:29.960 --> 39:30.840]  They rule.
[39:30.840 --> 39:33.280]  Every other apple, or not apple,
[39:33.360 --> 39:34.800]  I haven't done any other apple reads,
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.920]  but every other product read is always like,
[39:37.220 --> 39:38.780]  go to our store, buy this,
[39:38.880 --> 39:40.620]  like we have a sale on, which is totally understandable,
[39:40.820 --> 39:42.820]  like I'm not critiquing that, but theirs is just
[39:42.820 --> 39:44.600]  go to our website and look at our recipes,
[39:44.860 --> 39:45.920]  essentially. It's great.
[39:46.260 --> 39:49.020]  They don't necessarily have a great reason to
[39:49.020 --> 39:50.800]  sponsor their show, but they
[39:50.800 --> 39:51.480]  support us.
[39:51.700 --> 39:53.940]  They're just supporting us, which is wonderful.
[39:56.120 --> 39:59.080]  I gotta say, out of all the dumb,
[39:59.080 --> 40:01.180]  silly, funny successes we've had
[40:01.180 --> 40:01.680]  in this podcast,
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.800]  one of my favorite things was the
[40:04.800 --> 40:06.780]  variety omission, but
[40:06.780 --> 40:09.040]  I think seeing the tweet where they
[40:09.040 --> 40:11.200]  called their apple a regulation
[40:11.200 --> 40:13.080]  apple might have been like the
[40:13.700 --> 40:15.380]  most exciting, like the proudest
[40:15.380 --> 40:17.440]  moment I've had in F***face so far.
[40:18.180 --> 40:19.220]  Like a real
[40:19.220 --> 40:21.300]  company called their real
[40:21.300 --> 40:22.920]  product our fake thing.
[40:23.380 --> 40:24.320]  I just thought that was really cool.
[40:25.480 --> 40:26.920]  That's how you know you've made it in life,
[40:26.920 --> 40:27.780]  when you get to name an apple.
[40:32.680 --> 40:34.440]  When it comes to comedy, it's all
[40:34.440 --> 40:36.420]  about teamwork, setting things up,
[40:36.560 --> 40:38.600]  knocking out jokes. When you think of some of the great
[40:38.600 --> 40:40.160]  comedy duos like
[40:40.160 --> 40:42.200]  Keegan Peele or Abbott and Costello,
[40:42.980 --> 40:44.660]  Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder,
[40:44.980 --> 40:46.480]  there's just such a great balance
[40:46.480 --> 40:48.520]  in teamwork between the two. But what about
[40:48.520 --> 40:50.840]  the perfect duo when it comes to growing your business?
[40:51.320 --> 40:52.380]  That's you and

[42:41.740 --> 42:42.740]  Oh man.
[42:43.160 --> 42:44.900]  That's a big responsibility, naming an apple.
[42:45.520 --> 42:47.000]  Do you have to like create your own apple?
[42:47.280 --> 42:48.980]  Could you imagine? I couldn't.
[42:49.340 --> 42:51.140]  No, I didn't. We can't even
[42:51.140 --> 42:52.980]  name a podcast, never mind an apple.
[42:53.740 --> 42:55.220]  I would think if you were gonna start
[42:55.220 --> 42:57.440]  naming fruit, you'd wanna start
[42:57.440 --> 42:58.840]  with a lesser fruit.
[42:59.120 --> 43:00.500]  Like a more niche fruit.
[43:00.940 --> 43:02.380]  And then work your way up.
[43:02.760 --> 43:04.960]  What's like the least fruit then?
[43:05.100 --> 43:05.740]  What's the bottom?
[43:07.120 --> 43:08.080]  Bottom of fruit?
[43:09.180 --> 43:10.700]  Yeah, what's the bottom of fruit?
[43:11.280 --> 43:13.300]  Maybe like a honeydew
[43:13.300 --> 43:14.300]  melon or something? Yeah.
[43:14.780 --> 43:17.000]  Honeydew melons, it's pretty low.
[43:17.080 --> 43:19.280]  I mean it's good still, don't get me wrong. I'm not shitting on a honeydew
[43:19.280 --> 43:20.440]  melon, I'd eat it, you know?
[43:21.220 --> 43:21.840]  It's just filler.
[43:23.320 --> 43:24.900]  It's good in a fruit salad.
[43:25.380 --> 43:25.620]  Yeah.
[43:26.860 --> 43:29.380]  But I think you could get away with renaming
[43:29.380 --> 43:29.900]  honeydew.
[43:31.120 --> 43:32.960]  What would you rename honeydew to?
[43:35.360 --> 43:37.060]  See, this is why we have to start at the bottom.
[43:37.240 --> 43:39.220]  I mean, just not to be able
[43:39.220 --> 43:40.700]  to pop off. Not good.
[43:42.660 --> 43:43.320]  Honeydew is also
[43:43.320 --> 43:45.380]  a pretty good name. It's a better name than the...
[43:45.900 --> 43:46.880]  It's a way better...
[43:46.880 --> 43:48.760]  Honeydew sounds delicious.
[43:48.980 --> 43:50.740]  Right, but it's not.
[43:51.640 --> 43:52.460]  It's a trick.
[43:53.180 --> 43:54.740]  Yeah, it is a trick. It's a great name.
[43:55.200 --> 43:56.240]  I think we have a word...
[43:56.240 --> 43:57.900]  What about...
[43:59.600 --> 44:00.560]  Here's one.
[44:00.960 --> 44:01.440]  Grapefruit.
[44:03.320 --> 44:04.360]  It's not a grape.
[44:05.680 --> 44:06.840]  Grapefruit's a grapefruit.
[44:07.200 --> 44:08.520]  Doesn't look anything like a grape.
[44:08.680 --> 44:10.600]  It's a fucking stupid name. Rename it grapefruit.
[44:10.600 --> 44:12.100]  I'd be very confused. I'm sorry.
[44:12.240 --> 44:14.520]  I thought you were
[44:14.520 --> 44:16.580]  renaming Honeydew to Grapefruit.
[44:16.720 --> 44:18.580]  I'm sorry. No, I was just thinking
[44:18.580 --> 44:20.460]  of new fruit. Because you can't improve on Honeydew.
[44:20.760 --> 44:22.460]  There's no way to improve on Honeydew. It's already
[44:22.460 --> 44:23.440]  a better name than the fruit.
[44:23.660 --> 44:26.660]  We have to find a fruit that's got a name that's worse
[44:26.660 --> 44:28.380]  than the fruit. And that's definitely
[44:28.380 --> 44:28.900]  Grapefruit.
[44:30.660 --> 44:32.680]  Hmm. So what would be...
[44:32.680 --> 44:34.300]  So, Grapefruit...
[44:34.300 --> 44:35.920]  It's pink on the inside.
[44:36.460 --> 44:36.860]  Mmm.
[44:37.980 --> 44:40.500]  It's big. It's sour.
[44:41.040 --> 44:41.680]  It's a drink.
[44:42.200 --> 44:43.800]  It's a very drinkable fruit.
[44:44.000 --> 44:45.740]  What, Gracie, what did you write?
[44:46.980 --> 44:47.820]  Is that what you
[44:47.820 --> 44:49.880]  want to rename it to? I'm looking at a list of weird
[44:49.880 --> 44:50.240]  fruits.
[44:50.980 --> 44:53.540]  What is a Rambutan?
[44:54.620 --> 44:55.140]  What the?
[44:55.980 --> 44:56.460]  Rambutan?
[44:57.820 --> 44:58.300]  Rambutan.
[44:59.960 --> 45:00.920]  What is it?
[45:01.380 --> 45:03.720]  I thought... Guys, we need to
[45:03.720 --> 45:05.640]  keep things straight. I thought that she wanted
[45:05.640 --> 45:07.820]  to rename Grapefruit to Rambutan.
[45:08.100 --> 45:08.820]  I thought
[45:09.880 --> 45:10.920]  what was
[45:10.920 --> 45:11.900]  going on?
[45:13.940 --> 45:14.700]  I would
[45:14.700 --> 45:16.480]  rename a Radish Red Heat.
[45:17.340 --> 45:18.580]  I love that.
[45:18.840 --> 45:20.080]  That's great, dude.
[45:20.540 --> 45:22.960]  That's great. Can we make that...
[45:22.960 --> 45:24.060]  Is Jim Belushi going to sponsor it?
[45:24.380 --> 45:26.900]  I think the most disturbing looking fruit on Gracie's list
[45:26.900 --> 45:28.680]  is an Ackee. Yeah, I'm looking at two
[45:28.680 --> 45:31.000]  with triple eyeballs. What is going on there? They look like
[45:31.000 --> 45:31.500]  Poimals.
[45:33.420 --> 45:33.940]  Oh.
[45:34.560 --> 45:36.540]  They do look like Poimals.
[45:38.640 --> 45:39.100]  You know,
[45:39.200 --> 45:40.640]  now that you mention it, Gavin, they are a little
[45:40.640 --> 45:41.220]  arousing.
[45:43.320 --> 45:44.820]  If you imagine six
[45:44.820 --> 45:46.540]  of them on a muscular back...
[45:47.200 --> 45:48.920]  Ooh, we getting another smut novel?
[45:49.780 --> 45:51.100]  We still have to finish the first one.
[45:51.400 --> 45:52.440]  Oh yeah, when are we...
[45:53.940 --> 45:54.500]  I'm sorry.
[45:54.700 --> 45:56.800]  I've been so distracted by this goddamn dog and trying
[45:56.800 --> 45:58.640]  to get into a routine with the dog that it's really fucked up
[45:58.640 --> 46:00.800]  my ability to get
[46:00.800 --> 46:02.860]  some of that stuff done. I'll get in touch with you soon, Gavin.
[46:03.140 --> 46:06.100]  Okay, because I'm ready. I'm ready to finish
[46:06.100 --> 46:08.240]  the characters. I gotta say, most of these
[46:08.820 --> 46:09.920]  names are pretty good.
[46:10.000 --> 46:11.880]  I wanna add the new characters too, I'm very excited about that.
[46:12.820 --> 46:14.060]  Passionfruit is a good name.
[46:14.580 --> 46:15.640]  Dragonfruit's a good name. Dude,
[46:16.600 --> 46:18.260]  Breadfruit is a dogshit name.
[46:19.440 --> 46:20.160]  Is there a wet
[46:20.160 --> 46:22.140]  fruit? Maybe
[46:22.140 --> 46:23.700]  that's what we should rename Breadfruit to.
[46:24.200 --> 46:24.660]  Oh god.
[46:27.260 --> 46:27.580]  Acai.
[46:27.760 --> 46:30.100]  That's fun to say. Acai is a lot of fun
[46:30.100 --> 46:31.400]  to say. It's a great name.
[46:31.920 --> 46:34.200]  Is that how you say it? That's one of those words that I just look at but never
[46:34.200 --> 46:35.220]  say out loud. Yeah.
[46:37.320 --> 46:38.280]  Pomelo. Pomelo's a good
[46:38.280 --> 46:40.420]  name. That's a better name for a grapefruit than grapefruit.
[46:40.760 --> 46:41.760]  It's essentially the same thing.
[46:43.800 --> 46:44.440]  But here
[46:44.440 --> 46:45.960]  we are talking about fruit again.
[46:47.440 --> 46:48.180]  You can't go wrong
[46:48.180 --> 46:48.560]  with fruit.
[46:50.220 --> 46:51.980]  I had an idea for a food challenge.
[46:52.180 --> 46:54.160]  I know I'm in the middle of one with Gracie right now over
[46:54.160 --> 46:56.160]  the croutons, but I had an idea
[46:56.160 --> 46:58.100]  for a food challenge that I don't think
[46:58.100 --> 47:00.180]  anybody could complete, and I would be interested
[47:00.180 --> 47:01.740]  to see how close we could get.
[47:02.140 --> 47:03.280]  How do you guys feel about bread?
[47:03.740 --> 47:05.760]  I love bread. Oh dear. You feel like you could eat a lot
[47:05.760 --> 47:07.360]  of bread, right? No, no.
[47:07.620 --> 47:09.740]  I don't feel like I could eat a lot of it, but I like it.
[47:10.000 --> 47:11.720]  I do. Like I get one of those baguettes
[47:11.720 --> 47:13.600]  or something, I could just be like nom nom nom and eat the whole thing.
[47:14.760 --> 47:15.680]  Like it's disappearing
[47:16.180 --> 47:17.460]  in a fucking pencil sharpener.
[47:17.580 --> 47:18.640]  Just like cram it in.
[47:20.380 --> 47:21.360]  But you know what
[47:21.360 --> 47:23.380]  no one could eat all of? I've decided.
[47:23.500 --> 47:24.920]  I was thinking about it at the grocery store the other day.
[47:25.540 --> 47:26.780]  A loaf of white bread.
[47:28.400 --> 47:29.280]  A full loaf?
[47:29.280 --> 47:31.180]  Just like a full ass loaf of
[47:31.180 --> 47:33.700]  Iron Kids white bread, or like sunbeam
[47:33.700 --> 47:35.300]  white bread. In one go?
[47:35.460 --> 47:37.140]  Just peel it off and just eat it like
[47:38.020 --> 47:38.940]  just a fucking
[47:39.400 --> 47:40.560]  slice of bread at a time.
[47:40.920 --> 47:43.040]  I don't see why I couldn't do that.
[47:43.780 --> 47:44.960]  You would be so...
[47:44.960 --> 47:47.180]  first off, bored, and secondly
[47:47.700 --> 47:49.540]  you would get three pieces
[47:49.540 --> 47:50.520]  in and you'd be like, I'm out.
[47:51.660 --> 47:53.500]  So you can't put butter on it
[47:53.500 --> 47:54.820]  or anything? No, you're just
[47:55.380 --> 47:56.720]  eating plain bread.
[47:58.060 --> 47:58.560]  Crusts?
[47:59.320 --> 48:00.080]  You gotta eat the crust.
[48:00.260 --> 48:02.360]  And you can't toast it.
[48:02.640 --> 48:04.680]  It's gotta be as it
[48:04.680 --> 48:06.820]  comes out of the bag. I feel like toast
[48:06.820 --> 48:08.620]  is kind of as it... there's nothing
[48:08.620 --> 48:09.000]  added.
[48:10.980 --> 48:12.580]  There's no toast. Okay.
[48:13.960 --> 48:14.460]  Everybody
[48:14.460 --> 48:16.680]  wants to eat a loaf
[48:16.680 --> 48:18.700]  of toasted bread. Nobody wants to
[48:18.700 --> 48:20.920]  eat a loaf of regular bread. That's the point.
[48:21.940 --> 48:22.800]  I'm thinking maybe
[48:22.800 --> 48:24.760]  I could take the bread and smush
[48:24.760 --> 48:26.620]  it down back to sort of a doughy texture
[48:26.620 --> 48:28.600]  and get more in. That's certainly
[48:28.600 --> 48:30.740]  a tactic you
[48:30.740 --> 48:32.660]  could try. I feel like
[48:32.660 --> 48:34.760]  you'd walk a dangerous line of making yourself
[48:34.760 --> 48:36.360]  puke in the process of doing it.
[48:36.700 --> 48:38.180]  You think smashing it
[48:38.720 --> 48:40.660]  into the shape of an apple and then eating
[48:40.660 --> 48:42.700]  it like an apple would help? Oh, hell yeah.
[48:43.000 --> 48:44.040]  Dude, apple bread?
[48:45.720 --> 48:46.800]  Sign me up for
[48:46.800 --> 48:48.180]  apple bread. That's breadfruit!
[48:51.220 --> 48:52.640]  Maybe that's what we do in 2024.
[48:52.640 --> 48:53.580]  We just make...
[48:53.580 --> 48:56.300]  We take bread and shape it into other fruits.
[48:56.900 --> 48:58.520]  We must be able to get a mold
[48:58.520 --> 49:00.480]  of an apple and cram an entire
[49:00.480 --> 49:02.600]  loaf into it. And then just use
[49:02.600 --> 49:04.440]  hydraulics to smush it into an apple.
[49:04.960 --> 49:06.240]  Yeah, I think we could do that.
[49:07.500 --> 49:08.860]  I'm pretty sure we could do that.
[49:12.320 --> 49:14.600]  So outside of shit being everywhere, Geoff,
[49:14.800 --> 49:16.520]  how is the new dog? What's the
[49:16.520 --> 49:18.600]  experience like so far? He's already started
[49:18.600 --> 49:20.680]  chewing on my wall. Not excited about that.
[49:21.460 --> 49:22.740]  Gonna have to get some...
[49:23.080 --> 49:24.940]  Gonna have to get some molding replaced.
[49:25.460 --> 49:26.640]  How does he get a good purchase
[49:26.640 --> 49:28.080]  on a wall? Like on the corner?
[49:28.580 --> 49:30.400]  No, you know how like in my... well, maybe you don't.
[49:30.460 --> 49:32.420]  But in my hallway, going from the kitchen to the bedroom,
[49:32.540 --> 49:34.420]  there's like, I don't know,
[49:34.480 --> 49:36.080]  shit on the wall, like a...
[49:36.680 --> 49:38.300]  wainscoting almost, on the wall.
[49:38.360 --> 49:40.440]  It's like a pattern. He just like gnawed
[49:40.440 --> 49:42.120]  on a fucking hunk of that.
[49:43.360 --> 49:44.440]  I was thinking
[49:44.440 --> 49:46.380]  maybe you could like wood putty it, but
[49:46.380 --> 49:48.040]  it's not. It's just fucking wrecked.
[49:48.040 --> 49:49.780]  It's absolutely wrecked.
[49:50.280 --> 49:52.280]  Other than that, he's good. He sleeps through the night.
[49:53.520 --> 49:53.840]  He...
[49:53.840 --> 49:56.020]  If I stay on top of him, he doesn't really have any
[49:56.020 --> 49:58.100]  accidents in the house. He took a dump in the house
[49:58.100 --> 50:00.040]  yesterday, but that's because I think I left him in his pen for
[50:00.040 --> 50:00.960]  just a little bit too long.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.920]  Other than that, as long as I maintain
[50:03.920 --> 50:06.100]  eye contact, or eyesight on him at all
[50:06.100 --> 50:08.040]  times, so I can stop him from destroying my
[50:08.040 --> 50:08.740]  house, we're good.
[50:10.800 --> 50:11.120]  It's...
[50:11.580 --> 50:13.060]  It's a lot of work, having a puppy.
[50:13.980 --> 50:16.000]  Do you think you made the most of the in-between
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.200]  period where you had no dog?
[50:17.840 --> 50:19.880]  Yeah. Emily and I have had the conversation,
[50:20.040 --> 50:22.000]  and let me preface this by saying we're very happy with the
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.180]  dog. The dog is adorable. It's very sweet. It's a very good
[50:24.180 --> 50:25.960]  dog. He's gonna be a great dog.
[50:26.120 --> 50:27.880]  He's already a good dog. Which dog?
[50:28.240 --> 50:29.680]  Uh, the new dog. But
[50:31.140 --> 50:32.040]  we both had
[50:32.040 --> 50:34.020]  the conversation that, you know, because Henry died
[50:34.020 --> 50:35.140]  and I... Arrow died
[50:35.940 --> 50:37.840]  right at two years ago now. Henry died
[50:37.840 --> 50:39.980]  two Octobers ago, and we were like
[50:39.980 --> 50:41.940]  yeah, we could've waited another six months. We could've probably
[50:41.940 --> 50:44.020]  waited another six, nine months before we
[50:44.020 --> 50:45.980]  did this, but then we wouldn't have this
[50:45.980 --> 50:48.160]  dog, right? Then we wouldn't have this wall-chewing
[50:48.160 --> 50:49.860]  little monster. That's fair.
[50:50.140 --> 50:51.540]  It'd be some other wall-chewing monster.
[50:53.380 --> 50:53.860]  Is
[50:53.860 --> 50:55.600]  is it, uh
[50:55.600 --> 50:58.000]  I'm trying to think of how to ask this without
[50:58.900 --> 51:00.260]  making it feel like
[51:01.200 --> 51:02.160]  I'm judging
[51:02.160 --> 51:03.700]  your time. Go for it.
[51:05.560 --> 51:06.220]  You were
[51:06.220 --> 51:08.280]  asked if you feel like you made the most
[51:08.280 --> 51:10.160]  of your time
[51:10.160 --> 51:12.140]  without dog, or in-between dog
[51:12.140 --> 51:14.240]  of having a dog and not having
[51:14.240 --> 51:15.800]  a dog and everything. What
[51:15.800 --> 51:18.180]  did you do that, like, you couldn't do
[51:18.180 --> 51:20.060]  with a dog where you felt like
[51:20.540 --> 51:22.100]  that was the maximum use?
[51:22.640 --> 51:24.380]  Like, that was the best use of my time?
[51:24.640 --> 51:25.680]  I traveled with
[51:25.680 --> 51:27.780]  a lot easier, you know?
[51:28.320 --> 51:30.080]  I traveled without having to
[51:30.080 --> 51:31.840]  make arrangements with the
[51:31.840 --> 51:34.180]  to get the dog boarded and then
[51:34.180 --> 51:34.960]  have to, you know,
[51:36.080 --> 51:38.160]  leave three hours earlier to go to the airport
[51:38.160 --> 51:40.180]  so I could swing up to North Austin to drop him
[51:40.180 --> 51:42.120]  off at the boarding place and
[51:42.120 --> 51:44.260]  then worry about him being
[51:44.260 --> 51:46.340]  in, you know, worry about the dog for four days
[51:46.340 --> 51:48.200]  while we're in New York or whatever. And then
[51:48.200 --> 51:50.160]  having to race home and try to get home before the
[51:50.160 --> 51:52.080]  boarding house closes or pay another day
[51:52.080 --> 51:54.160]  of boarding fee. You know, all that stuff you don't have to worry
[51:54.160 --> 51:56.080]  about anymore. Uh, you never
[51:56.080 --> 51:57.940]  find yourself out and about
[51:57.940 --> 52:00.200]  and be like, oh shit, I gotta get home
[52:00.200 --> 52:01.840]  and let the dog out to pee or he's gonna be fuckin'
[52:01.940 --> 52:04.180]  he's gonna be going crazy. Or, or, oh, it's about
[52:04.180 --> 52:05.120]  seven, we could
[52:06.080 --> 52:08.500]  stay out later but we really do need to feed the dog.
[52:08.500 --> 52:10.480]  All that stuff, you know? All the, just
[52:10.480 --> 52:12.820]  the responsibility stuff of it. I just, I enjoyed
[52:13.340 --> 52:14.700]  not having those
[52:14.700 --> 52:16.100]  moments. I also enjoyed
[52:16.100 --> 52:18.300]  not taking a dog to the vet
[52:18.300 --> 52:20.240]  twice a week for a year.
[52:20.420 --> 52:22.520]  Which is what I was doing there. Oh, was that, was that, that was happening
[52:22.520 --> 52:24.480]  a lot? Yeah, especially for the last
[52:24.480 --> 52:26.580]  year they were both alive. It was just like, I was at the vet
[52:26.580 --> 52:27.980]  every, I was at the vet and the dentist
[52:28.400 --> 52:30.460]  every week. Gavin, you have to do that
[52:30.460 --> 52:32.420]  with cats or what? Or do you just kinda like leave
[52:32.420 --> 52:34.540]  them at home? Leave, leave them. Yeah, right?
[52:34.760 --> 52:36.540]  Okay. It's, it's also- They can live, they can
[52:36.540 --> 52:37.020]  live ages.
[52:39.840 --> 52:40.460]  It's also
[52:40.460 --> 52:42.700]  because I had elderly dogs that, you know,
[52:42.800 --> 52:44.680]  Henry, Henry had a
[52:45.140 --> 52:46.720]  tumor wrapped around his spleen
[52:46.720 --> 52:48.760]  and one around his heart for the last
[52:48.760 --> 52:50.560]  year and a half he was alive and so we
[52:50.560 --> 52:52.460]  were managing that and, you know,
[52:52.600 --> 52:54.220]  Arrow had all
[52:54.220 --> 52:56.480]  manner of problems and so that's why they had to go to the vet
[52:56.480 --> 52:58.460]  so much. But, I just,
[52:58.740 --> 53:00.400]  the, just not having to
[53:00.400 --> 53:02.560]  worry, you know? Not having to
[53:02.560 --> 53:04.620]  worry about being
[53:04.620 --> 53:06.640]  home at a certain time or, I don't
[53:06.640 --> 53:08.520]  know, it's just less responsibility was nice. I
[53:08.520 --> 53:09.420]  definitely enjoyed it.
[53:10.740 --> 53:12.600]  Does baby David have a favorite toy
[53:12.600 --> 53:14.480]  yet? Uh,
[53:14.820 --> 53:15.980]  that's not, that's not his name.
[53:17.440 --> 53:18.580]  Um, yeah, he
[53:18.580 --> 53:20.360]  really likes any
[53:20.360 --> 53:21.580]  shoe that you're wearing.
[53:23.620 --> 53:24.700]  So like, if I'm
[53:24.700 --> 53:26.520]  wearing, like right now I'm wearing a pair of
[53:26.520 --> 53:28.600]  Nikes, he li- that's his favorite toy. If I take those
[53:28.600 --> 53:30.580]  off and put on a pair of Vans, that
[53:30.580 --> 53:32.480]  would become his favorite toy. My
[53:32.480 --> 53:34.540]  shoelaces. And, uh,
[53:34.600 --> 53:36.480]  yeah. That's, that's pretty much all he gives a shit
[53:36.480 --> 53:38.360]  about. That and the wall. Okay. Do you,
[53:38.460 --> 53:40.480]  do you have a, a skill that you
[53:40.480 --> 53:42.440]  put a lot of time into when you were
[53:42.440 --> 53:44.500]  younger that you thought would
[53:44.500 --> 53:46.540]  be more useful and become a bigger part
[53:46.540 --> 53:47.860]  of your life but just never did?
[53:48.400 --> 53:48.860]  Do you?
[53:50.460 --> 53:52.480]  I feel like I got really good
[53:52.480 --> 53:54.020]  and I put the time and effort into
[53:54.020 --> 53:56.560]  that thing where you put your hands
[53:56.560 --> 53:58.580]  together and you, you boost people
[53:58.580 --> 54:00.520]  up and help them like climb over a fence and stuff.
[54:00.520 --> 54:02.580]  Uh-huh. You got really good
[54:02.580 --> 54:04.740]  at that? Yeah, I was just solid at it. I just
[54:04.740 --> 54:06.640]  thought, you know, this is worth, this is a skill, it's worth
[54:06.640 --> 54:08.620]  being good at. And then it
[54:08.620 --> 54:10.560]  just went away. Like, I don't even remember the last time
[54:10.560 --> 54:12.660]  I did it. Should we- It was just gone
[54:12.660 --> 54:13.840]  from my life and, uh,
[54:14.800 --> 54:16.540]  I'm a little bit disappointed. Should we
[54:16.540 --> 54:17.800]  try it soon?
[54:18.600 --> 54:20.300]  To see if I still got it. Yeah.
[54:20.600 --> 54:22.560]  Just, what was your, did you have a method?
[54:22.980 --> 54:24.560]  Uh, just, you know, you just sort of bounce
[54:24.560 --> 54:26.340]  with the person as they're running up. You just sort of
[54:27.140 --> 54:28.440]  become, become like a flowing
[54:28.440 --> 54:30.160]  motion. Yeah. It's about
[54:30.160 --> 54:31.240]  momentum, I think.
[54:32.220 --> 54:32.920]  And grip.
[54:34.040 --> 54:36.360]  And that, that was your, and that's your
[54:36.360 --> 54:38.420]  skill? Yeah, it's just a skill that, you know,
[54:38.440 --> 54:40.060]  I invested time, I put the skill points in.
[54:40.440 --> 54:42.460]  It was like an early skill tree
[54:42.460 --> 54:44.260]  that has been a
[54:44.260 --> 54:45.040]  waste of points.
[54:48.200 --> 54:50.520]  I think I put all my early skill tree points
[54:50.520 --> 54:52.260]  into jumping ramps on
[54:53.320 --> 54:54.500]  BMXs. That's pretty
[54:54.500 --> 54:56.180]  much all I cared about when I was a kid.
[54:56.180 --> 54:58.280]  But you probably got good use out of those points.
[54:58.820 --> 54:59.700]  I mean, not,
[55:00.100 --> 55:01.440]  I don't jump shit now.
[55:03.200 --> 55:04.280]  I've retired since
[55:04.280 --> 55:06.220]  that one, since my badass slo-mo
[55:06.220 --> 55:07.420]  video we did a couple years ago.
[55:08.160 --> 55:09.960]  Which is available on the F*** Face YouTube
[55:09.960 --> 55:11.280]  and Rich Teeth site.
[55:11.960 --> 55:13.840]  You don't think you'll do stunt too?
[55:14.360 --> 55:16.180]  I haven't really, I haven't really...
[55:16.840 --> 55:18.020]  I gotta be honest with you,
[55:18.100 --> 55:19.980]  even since then, I think I've slowed down
[55:19.980 --> 55:22.280]  a little bit. Yeah, I don't really even ride my bike
[55:22.280 --> 55:24.120]  in that way anymore. I'm pretty
[55:24.120 --> 55:26.260]  just like, you know, go forward,
[55:26.400 --> 55:28.020]  stay on the ground. I'm not as
[55:28.020 --> 55:30.000]  adventurous as I used to be.
[55:30.040 --> 55:31.400]  I think I'm getting closer to death.
[55:32.820 --> 55:33.700]  Jesus Christ!
[55:34.140 --> 55:36.240]  That's what it is, right? You're just slowly
[55:36.240 --> 55:36.720]  dying
[55:38.140 --> 55:39.880]  day by day by day until,
[55:40.080 --> 55:42.180]  and you just diminish a little
[55:42.180 --> 55:44.220]  bit at a time until you look up and you
[55:44.220 --> 55:46.040]  realize you've diminished to such a degree
[55:46.040 --> 55:48.120]  that the thing you did six months ago you don't do
[55:48.120 --> 55:50.080]  anymore because you're not as much
[55:50.080 --> 55:51.840]  of a human now as you were then.
[55:51.840 --> 55:54.100]  So I'm just like, I'm four years past
[55:54.100 --> 55:55.560]  jumping shit in a ditch.
[55:57.000 --> 55:58.020]  So every day,
[55:58.520 --> 55:59.640]  every day you're dying.
[55:59.820 --> 56:01.620]  Well, I guess everyone is dying every day.
[56:01.700 --> 56:02.580]  You definitely are, yeah.
[56:03.800 --> 56:06.060]  Do you think you've had a single day
[56:06.060 --> 56:07.160]  where you weren't dying?
[56:07.840 --> 56:09.500]  In my life? Yeah.
[56:11.320 --> 56:13.840]  Like a day that just extended your life
[56:13.840 --> 56:14.280]  a little bit.
[56:21.050 --> 56:22.870]  Certainly. Right? I mean, I
[56:22.870 --> 56:24.550]  couldn't tell you what that day would be.
[56:24.550 --> 56:25.210]  Certainly!
[56:27.850 --> 56:28.750]  I couldn't tell you
[56:30.750 --> 56:32.870]  what that day would be, but there must have been one.
[56:33.410 --> 56:34.610]  How about you? Do you think you've had
[56:34.610 --> 56:36.510]  a life-extending day? I'm trying to
[56:36.510 --> 56:38.510]  wonder if there was a day where all I did
[56:38.510 --> 56:39.630]  was exercise and eat well.
[56:40.010 --> 56:41.490]  But I don't know if that's ever happened.
[56:43.250 --> 56:44.550]  When you said life-extending
[56:44.550 --> 56:46.550]  day, I thought it was something more
[56:46.550 --> 56:48.350]  like mental
[56:48.350 --> 56:50.250]  or like spiritual. I didn't consider
[56:50.250 --> 56:52.730]  just working out and eating well all day.
[56:52.730 --> 56:54.430]  Yeah, I didn't think about that.
[56:54.430 --> 56:55.150]  What were you thinking then?
[56:55.770 --> 56:58.370]  Just the birth of a child or
[56:58.370 --> 57:00.670]  something that was fulfilling in a way
[57:00.670 --> 57:01.870]  where it made you understand
[57:02.410 --> 57:04.430]  there's more than just a daily grind
[57:04.430 --> 57:05.770]  kind of a thing where you're just like,
[57:06.090 --> 57:07.250]  wow, I feel like
[57:08.210 --> 57:10.110]  an extended part of this universe.
[57:10.470 --> 57:11.550]  That's what I thought you meant.
[57:12.510 --> 57:13.930]  And not like,
[57:14.170 --> 57:16.530]  oh, I ran good on the treadmill.
[57:17.150 --> 57:18.710]  Birth of a child extends
[57:18.710 --> 57:20.450]  your joy and happiness
[57:20.450 --> 57:22.550]  and heart and
[57:22.550 --> 57:24.330]  all of those things. It does not extend
[57:24.330 --> 57:25.730]  your life at all.
[57:25.970 --> 57:28.430]  You immediately spend a lot of time very tired
[57:28.430 --> 57:30.630]  after that. Exhausted, stressed out
[57:30.630 --> 57:32.490]  and then you just watch
[57:32.490 --> 57:34.470]  this thing grow and become
[57:34.470 --> 57:36.010]  more complicated and wonderful
[57:36.010 --> 57:38.670]  and just recognize
[57:38.670 --> 57:40.630]  that as it's growing up, you're growing down.
[57:41.190 --> 57:42.530]  It just becomes a marker to see
[57:42.530 --> 57:44.330]  how much you're dying as it's
[57:44.330 --> 57:44.610]  living.
[57:46.010 --> 57:47.490]  It's like a death barometer.
[57:47.490 --> 57:49.510]  Yeah, yeah, Millie in some
[57:49.510 --> 57:50.930]  ways is like my death barometer.
[57:51.190 --> 57:53.290]  The older she gets, the closer to death I know I am.
[57:53.850 --> 57:54.690]  Oh my god.
[57:56.790 --> 57:59.130]  I remember I had a friend who had kids
[57:59.130 --> 58:01.370]  and then his grandparents met
[58:01.370 --> 58:03.330]  the baby and
[58:03.330 --> 58:05.330]  his grandparents went, well,
[58:05.950 --> 58:07.430]  I guess we're great grandparents
[58:07.430 --> 58:07.970]  now.
[58:08.630 --> 58:11.610]  They don't really make great, great grandparents.
[58:14.830 --> 58:16.350]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[58:17.390 --> 58:18.190]  Oh, yeah.
[58:19.090 --> 58:20.010]  You know how
[58:20.850 --> 58:22.730]  if you were to take some stock
[58:22.730 --> 58:24.810]  right now and you were to look back and think
[58:25.990 --> 58:26.870]  20 years ago
[58:26.870 --> 58:28.590]  and you'd be like, wow, that was a long time ago
[58:28.590 --> 58:29.650]  but it seems like yesterday.
[58:30.950 --> 58:32.370]  Like I'm 48, I can remember
[58:32.370 --> 58:34.490]  being 28. 28 does not feel that long ago.
[58:35.770 --> 58:36.550]  Pretty soon
[58:36.550 --> 58:38.510]  you're going to have that thought, but you'll be like
[58:38.510 --> 58:40.110]  85 and you're close to death
[58:40.110 --> 58:42.320]  and this will seem like yesterday to you.
[58:42.770 --> 58:43.570]  Isn't that weird?
[58:46.190 --> 58:48.030]  Enjoy this moment right now
[58:48.030 --> 58:49.930]  because pretty soon you're going to be
[58:49.930 --> 58:51.890]  remembering this moment and how you didn't
[58:51.890 --> 58:53.930]  appreciate it enough and you're going to be like
[58:53.930 --> 58:56.010]  life sucks, I'm old
[58:56.010 --> 58:57.450]  and everything's broken and it hurts
[58:57.450 --> 59:00.170]  and my dick fell off and my heart is
[59:00.170 --> 59:02.010]  in pain. And that'll be
[59:02.010 --> 59:02.890]  the best you can enjoy.
[59:03.990 --> 59:06.110]  It is weird thinking back to
[59:06.110 --> 59:07.590]  World War II and stuff and how
[59:07.590 --> 59:09.490]  in the grand scheme of everything it was pretty
[59:09.490 --> 59:11.870]  recent. But also to think that it was
[59:11.870 --> 59:13.590]  what, like 75 years ago
[59:13.590 --> 59:15.610]  or something? But when I was born it was only
[59:15.610 --> 59:17.170]  like four decades ago.
[59:17.650 --> 59:19.330]  It is weird too because I
[59:19.330 --> 59:21.310]  listened to this podcast recently
[59:21.310 --> 59:23.010]  a couple months ago now about
[59:23.590 --> 59:25.790]  this guy was talking about near past
[59:25.790 --> 59:27.630]  versus far past and
[59:27.630 --> 59:29.430]  he was saying that at the
[59:29.430 --> 59:31.670]  50 year mark, about the 50 year mark
[59:31.670 --> 59:33.470]  for a society, everything
[59:33.470 --> 59:35.370]  that happened more than 50 years ago
[59:35.370 --> 59:37.470]  we completely and totally lose touch
[59:37.470 --> 59:38.950]  with and frame of reference for.
[59:39.290 --> 59:41.450]  Like we're good, we can understand
[59:41.450 --> 59:43.450]  things up to about 50 years ago, but once
[59:43.450 --> 59:45.390]  we hit that 50 year mark, our understanding
[59:45.390 --> 59:46.530]  and compassion
[59:47.470 --> 59:49.610]  and care just falls off a cliff.
[59:50.250 --> 59:50.910]  And so
[59:50.910 --> 59:53.290]  our collective history
[59:53.290 --> 59:55.330]  is really only about 50 years. And so
[59:55.830 --> 59:57.330]  every, you know, once
[59:57.330 --> 59:59.230]  you're like 55, Gavin, you're just going to be
[59:59.230 --> 01:00:01.310]  shitting out a year's worth of memories every year
[01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:01.790]  you're alive.
[01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:04.150]  As the
[01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:05.470]  rest of the world does too.
[01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:07.790]  Yeah, it is weird watching the world forget stuff.
[01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:10.130]  Even looking at like the space stuff
[01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:11.930]  they're doing now and all their rocket
[01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:13.990]  launches and how they're all cheering
[01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:15.770]  and celebrating when a rocket doesn't
[01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:16.310]  explode.
[01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:19.930]  Or when like most of the boosters turn
[01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:21.970]  on. But it's like, didn't we used
[01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:23.870]  to have a pretty good record of doing that?
[01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:25.130]  Like with people in them?
[01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:27.370]  It's a feeling everyone's forgot everything.
[01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:29.470]  I agree with that.
[01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:31.670]  The scale
[01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:33.610]  that I judge it by is
[01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:36.010]  I remember a time
[01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:38.110]  before Homeland Security
[01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:39.870]  and there are a lot
[01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.850]  of people who don't because
[01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:43.430]  they weren't born then.
[01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.950]  And if you think
[01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:47.690]  about that and then go back further
[01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:49.590]  and go like, oh, there are people who remember
[01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:51.790]  before the CIA, which
[01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:53.990]  is a relatively new thing
[01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:56.090]  in the scope of not just like people
[01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:57.910]  but like the nation. And it's like
[01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:59.870]  when you're talking about forgetting
[01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:02.030]  things, to me, it's the laying down
[01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:04.290]  the foundations of like weird new institutions
[01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:06.030]  that we go, oh yeah, that's
[01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.950]  always been here. Hasn't
[01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:10.210]  always been here. I feel like that with TSA.
[01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:12.130]  There you go. It's that.
[01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:13.610]  That's like brand new.
[01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:16.270]  Yeah, Gracie said she's never experienced pre-TSA.
[01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:17.050]  Wow.
[01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:19.850]  It's amazing how quickly
[01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:22.130]  when something is adopted, you just get used to it.
[01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:24.010]  Yep. And then how
[01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:26.090]  the next generation is just born with it.
[01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:27.870]  They have it, and they go, I guess
[01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:29.530]  it's just how it was. And then
[01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:32.150]  you go down the road, and it's just an established
[01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:34.250]  thing, and the CIA is just there.
[01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:34.970]  It's crazy.
[01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:36.490]  Okay.
[01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:39.470]  It's like being in Austin.
[01:01:39.850 --> 01:01:41.950]  You drive down the road, and there's just
[01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:44.170]  a fucking crane in the middle of a block
[01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:45.930]  just ripping up a building, and you're like,
[01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:47.710]  what the fuck was that building yesterday?
[01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:49.990]  And you realize, you drove by that building
[01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:51.610]  every day for 20 years,
[01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:53.950]  but the second they tore it down, you've completely
[01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:56.110]  flushed it from your memory. And then the next
[01:01:56.110 --> 01:01:58.110]  day, it's a new building, and you're like, was there an old building
[01:01:58.110 --> 01:01:59.930]  there a week ago? And you're just, fucking, it's gone.
[01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:02.090]  The next time
[01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:03.650]  I come to your house, can I take something
[01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:05.190]  and see if you notice what I took?
[01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:07.010]  Awesome! That
[01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:09.450]  rules. Can you...
[01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:09.790]  What are the limits?
[01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:13.410]  It can't be anything Emily's.
[01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.750]  Well, how do I know?
[01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:16.830]  Well, you'll have to talk to her.
[01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:19.850]  Work it out with her. She won't tell me.
[01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:22.830]  Emily is...
[01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:24.430]  Here's one thing I'll say about my wife
[01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:26.730]  that is wonderful and frustrating about her.
[01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:28.910]  Emily remains true to
[01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:30.630]  the bit. That's true.
[01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:32.310]  That's tremendous about her.
[01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:34.550]  If the bit is getting
[01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:36.230]  won over on me, she will
[01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:38.670]  be the best fucking partner you have.
[01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:40.230]  And she will not let it slip.
[01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:42.690]  I want to see how
[01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:44.650]  big an item I can take without
[01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:45.970]  you noticing. Okay.
[01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:48.510]  I bet I'll fucking notice, but we'll find out.
[01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:50.730]  What celebrities do you guys
[01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:52.670]  think will exist past 50 years?
[01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:54.110]  That are alive now?
[01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:55.910]  Yeah, that are big celebrities right now.
[01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:58.530]  If you think about it, Taylor Swift
[01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:00.530]  is probably the most famous person in the world.
[01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.730]  I would think. 50 years
[01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:05.050]  from now, will people still remember Taylor Swift?
[01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:06.630]  Or 50 years after she dies, will people
[01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:08.570]  still remember Taylor Swift? Probably.
[01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:10.690]  But there's only
[01:03:10.690 --> 01:03:12.190]  going to be like four or five.
[01:03:12.610 --> 01:03:14.570]  From all of your lifetime, from your
[01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:16.630]  generation, all the most famous people
[01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:18.830]  you know, all the most impactful people you know,
[01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:20.370]  it's going to be whittled down to
[01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:22.870]  15 that are going to exist
[01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:24.890]  in history books or in media
[01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:26.530]  in some way after
[01:03:26.530 --> 01:03:27.910]  50 years.
[01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:30.850]  It's just weird to think. Like Ryan Reynolds? Nobody's going to
[01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:31.810]  know who he is in 50 years.
[01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:34.990]  Jon Favreau? Might as well not have
[01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:36.790]  existed. Because they're not famous
[01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:38.750]  enough. Because very few fucking
[01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:40.690]  famous people... Go back and watch a movie from
[01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:42.710]  1940 and recognize
[01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:44.790]  that everybody on screen was famous
[01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:46.790]  in 1940 and everybody knew who they were.
[01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.550]  But you maybe know one person.
[01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:50.190]  You're like, oh Clark Gable, I remember him.
[01:03:50.350 --> 01:03:52.850]  But you don't know who the other people were. Because most
[01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:54.730]  famous people don't... I mean
[01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:56.350]  nothing exists past that 50 years
[01:03:56.350 --> 01:03:58.510]  including celebrities. And so it's... I don't know
[01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:00.010]  I've been thinking a lot lately about like
[01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:02.550]  you can never tell what's going to
[01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:04.490]  stand the test of time and what doesn't. And it's always
[01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:06.510]  a bit surprising. I think we'll still have
[01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:07.150]  Dick Van Dyke.
[01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:12.510]  Do we have Dick Van Dyke now?
[01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:13.030]  I don't know.
[01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.150]  I was
[01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:17.150]  watching an interview where Dick Van Dyke was talking
[01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:19.110]  about his outlook on life and how he's
[01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:21.090]  very active and he just tries to
[01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:22.810]  make new friends all the time
[01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:24.550]  because all of his friends died.
[01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:26.510]  Yeah. Like every single one of them.
[01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:29.290]  Well he's gotta be like 98, right? He's up there.
[01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:30.950]  Yeah. I think about that with
[01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.450]  bands all the time. Like
[01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:35.010]  if you go back to 1997 and you
[01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:36.950]  go, dude, you know who's like super
[01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:38.890]  popular? Like still around, Reunion Tour
[01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:41.210]  kicking off a new album
[01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:43.970]  in 2023-2024 is Blink-182.
[01:04:44.090 --> 01:04:45.410]  I don't think anybody would have
[01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:47.330]  thought that was a thing that
[01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:49.290]  stuck around. It would have been any number
[01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:50.830]  of other bands. That is
[01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:53.210]  a great example, Eric. It's
[01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:55.310]  like you look at all those bands and you look
[01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:57.210]  at who's popular at the time and you're like, oh
[01:04:57.210 --> 01:04:59.130]  well, Third Eye Blind is huge. They're clearly
[01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:01.010]  going to be the ones that are going to release 30 albums.
[01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:03.270]  They're going to be the Rolling Stones someday.
[01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:05.350]  But they're not. It's Green Day
[01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:07.410]  and Blink-182 are going to be the Beatles
[01:05:07.410 --> 01:05:09.190]  and the Rolling Stones going on
[01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:11.210]  their final tour for the 50th fucking
[01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:13.130]  time when they're in their 70s.
[01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:14.650]  That's who it's going to be.
[01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:17.190]  And all those other bands that were just as good as
[01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:18.890]  them or that people like just as much as them
[01:05:19.590 --> 01:05:19.990]  won't.
[01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:23.110]  It's just weird. It's just weird what
[01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.190]  stands the test of time
[01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:27.030]  and what doesn't. Either way, Shaq
[01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:28.970]  will be remembered. Absolutely.
[01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:30.490]  I think you're absolutely right.
[01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:31.710]  I think you're absolutely right.
[01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:34.750]  This was a good episode of the So Alright Podcast.
[01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:39.230]  Is that what this
[01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:40.870]  was? Well, Andrew vanished
[01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:42.350]  and I was
[01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:44.390]  very distracted by that.
[01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:47.130]  He's still gone. Yeah, Andrew said
[01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:48.830]  he's not feeling well and needs to
[01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:50.830]  take off for a little bit.
[01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:52.270]  What if we take
[01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:54.770]  when he came back after throwing up,
[01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:57.110]  cut there and then redo the second
[01:05:57.110 --> 01:05:58.010]  half of this podcast.
[01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.170]  Yeah, we could
[01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:05.310]  do that. Well, if we didn't
[01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:07.150]  and you hear this, I just missed him.
[01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:08.130]  I missed him too.
[01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:10.730]  I missed him too.
[01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:13.390]  He always provides
[01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:15.050]  so much unique energy to these kinds of questions
[01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:16.810]  and he always has a fresh take on it.
[01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:17.970]  I'm bummed we didn't get it.
[01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:20.830]  If you like hearing from Gus
[01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:22.810]  take two, here we go.
[01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:25.070]  3, 2, 1. If you like hearing
[01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:26.430]  from Geoff and Gavin,
[01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:34.630]  check out Does It Do?
[01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:35.790]  Which premieres
[01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:38.350]  on January 29th
[01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:40.610]  on our YouTube channel and Facebook.com
[01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:42.210]  a new season of Does It Do?
[01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:44.250]  You can see if it does. That's right.
[01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:46.590]  It's Geoff and Gavin and they're back and Gus is not
[01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:48.730]  there. Gus is nowhere to be found on this.
[01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:50.310]  It's just Geoff and Gavin
[01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:51.490]  and it's very good.
[01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:54.450]  Here's a game you can play while you're watching season 2
[01:06:54.450 --> 01:06:56.690]  of Does It Do? See if you can spot the moment
[01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:58.830]  where I bleed
[01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:00.490]  but hide it from the
[01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:01.950]  cameras this time so nobody knows.
[01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:03.770]  I just proved that before this.
[01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.950]  Incredibly obvious.
[01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:06.210]  Oh, is it?
[01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:09.870]  Well, there you go. You'll be able to tell
[01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:10.470]  when I bleed.
[01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:12.630]  Oh, man.
[01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:15.790]  That might be the first time I've ever knocked
[01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:17.850]  anyone flying. You knocked me
[01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:19.630]  flying, dude. You definitely did.
[01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.830]  I didn't know I had it in me.
[01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:23.530]  Well, don't have it in you again. How about that?
[01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:25.590]  Yeah, I won't. It wasn't on purpose.
[01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:29.790]  I hope this wasn't
[01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:31.290]  the worst episode we've ever made.
[01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:33.050]  We'll see.
[01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:35.390]  We'll leave it up to the audience.
[01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:37.650]  If Gavin's out,
[01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:39.770]  that's bad. No, honestly, the worst
[01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:41.570]  episode we ever made is where I had to talk about Snoopy
[01:07:41.570 --> 01:07:42.130]  for a while.
[01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:44.410]  I kind of like Snoopy.
[01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:47.490]  I think that was the worst episode we ever had.
[01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:50.010]  There's some pretty Gavin-heavy ones that aren't great.
[01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:56.650]  We'll see you next time!
[01:07:59.090 --> 01:07:59.490]  Goddamn.
[01:07:59.490 --> 01:07:59.630]  Goddamn.
[01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:02.830]  Hey there, everybody. You think you probably are just
[01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:04.710]  winding down listening to the end
[01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:06.490]  of episode 190, but
[01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:08.450]  we're not gonna do that to you because it was a weird
[01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:10.510]  fucking ending. I don't know if you noticed,
[01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:12.610]  but Andrew disappeared for about a half
[01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:14.890]  an hour there. He didn't know what the fuck was going on.
[01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:16.310]  So we're recording this.
[01:08:16.530 --> 01:08:18.350]  What is this? Two days later? Three days later?
[01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:20.770]  Andrew, you are still alive? I'm still alive!
[01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:22.630]  Thankfully. Can we finish the fucking
[01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:24.610]  episode now? What did I miss?
[01:08:24.610 --> 01:08:26.350]  First of all, what were we talking about when I
[01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:28.590]  had to dip out? We were fucking vamping
[01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:30.210]  hard, dude. It was
[01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:32.650]  like 20 minutes of vamp. Gavin
[01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:34.090]  accused me of just
[01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:36.670]  switching over and filming an episode of So Alright
[01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:37.610]  in the middle of it.
[01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:40.810]  That wasn't an accusation. I was just saying it was Andrew-less.
[01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:42.470]  So we ended up just like shooting the shit.
[01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:44.150]  It was nice. I enjoyed it.
[01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:46.750]  I apologize. So I was, as I mentioned,
[01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:48.670]  I started antibiotics and I had like
[01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:50.550]  an allergic reaction to it that I didn't
[01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:52.810]  know. I spent most of that recording
[01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:54.890]  thinking my appendix burst
[01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:56.630]  and I was just trying to gut it out,
[01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:58.630]  but it was not easy
[01:08:58.630 --> 01:09:00.930]  and then it just got to a point where I couldn't
[01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:02.870]  even listen. You said this
[01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:04.710]  to me. You were talking about how it felt like
[01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:06.970]  your appendix was going to burst and then afterwards you told me
[01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:08.790]  that you had it removed. Yeah, I didn't.
[01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:10.150]  I wasn't sure because I had
[01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:12.550]  like a surgery for unrelated
[01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:13.750]  stuff as a kid
[01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:15.570]  in that area
[01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:18.590]  and I couldn't remember if they just were like
[01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:20.870]  this isn't an issue but maybe it will be later so we
[01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:21.930]  had to look it out so I had to confirm it.
[01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:24.450]  So where is your appendix now?
[01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:26.550]  I don't know where it is but it's not in me.
[01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:28.270]  That's all I know. It's gone.
[01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:30.910]  So it's unrelated. Regardless, I just
[01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:32.790]  saw Iron Claw. Please don't
[01:09:32.790 --> 01:09:34.910]  gut anything out. I don't want you to die
[01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:36.790]  in a fucking hotel in Japan someday.
[01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:39.050]  Go to the doctor immediately.
[01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:40.930]  How north is
[01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:42.830]  Japan? Is that north? Is Japan
[01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:44.530]  genuinely north from where I am or
[01:09:44.530 --> 01:09:46.910]  is it north or lower? East, okay.
[01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:48.030]  Like southeast.
[01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:49.610]  But it is northern hemisphere.
[01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:52.270]  Who do you think has the most appendixes?
[01:09:53.270 --> 01:09:54.170]  What do you mean?
[01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:56.010]  Well like most people either have one
[01:09:56.010 --> 01:09:58.150]  or none. Do you think anyone has like
[01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:00.110]  a collection of appendixes in a
[01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:02.030]  jar? You think
[01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:03.950]  there's someone that has like a wisdom appendix?
[01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:06.090]  Oh! I just think you could win
[01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:07.970]  the record. You could win. You could have
[01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.970]  the top rank with very few
[01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:11.670]  appendixes unless you're in like a
[01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:13.550]  study of appendix.
[01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:16.010]  There's probably a
[01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:17.370]  museum of oddities.
[01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:19.950]  Have you ever been to the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia?
[01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:20.790]  No.
[01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:24.070]  It's like a museum of like medical oddities
[01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:25.310]  and they have like
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:26.170]  400
[01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:29.710]  babies that had spina bifida
[01:10:29.710 --> 01:10:31.310]  and you could just go look at like
[01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:33.950]  a wall of like 300 spina bifida
[01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:35.570]  kids. I'm sure there is
[01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:37.950]  like a museum that's just
[01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:39.890]  yeah, just a bunch of burst
[01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:41.930]  appendixes. You know how some people get
[01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:44.070]  born with two cocks or like a third arm?
[01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:46.330]  Do you think anyone has had a second
[01:10:46.330 --> 01:10:48.270]  appendix inside them? Because that would be
[01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:50.090]  probably the worst thing to have two of
[01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:52.070]  because they're completely worthless
[01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:53.930]  aren't they? Like sometimes you have an extra finger
[01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:56.190]  or nipple. I guess
[01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:58.030]  it would be the best thing to have two of but also the worst
[01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:59.750]  because it's not like you can use it.
[01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.810]  I was thinking
[01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:03.990]  just to take a minute, just a
[01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:05.970]  side step. I appreciate Geoff, you went with an actual
[01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:07.990]  museum. My mind immediately went to like
[01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:09.910]  the guy that's trying to collect every copy of
[01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:12.330]  Speed on VHS. Like the appendix
[01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:14.530]  equivalent of that dude. Just in a
[01:11:14.530 --> 01:11:16.290]  truck filled with appendixes. Be like
[01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:18.090]  hey, you got one? I'll take it.
[01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:20.350]  I'm getting all of them. The first person
[01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:22.330]  with a double appendix was in 1892.
[01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:24.470]  That we know of.
[01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:25.970]  Yeah, that we know of.
[01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:28.430]  It's prevalence is very
[01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:30.290]  very low. It's found in two in every
[01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:32.370]  50,000 cases that
[01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:34.350]  have had surgery for appendicitis.
[01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:35.810]  But that's for people who
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:38.130]  I've never had appendicitis. I might have five.
[01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:40.030]  I have no idea. Yeah, that's true.
[01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:41.970]  What do you think would be
[01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:43.630]  the absolute worst
[01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:45.410]  to have two of?
[01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:47.370]  Brain? Oh, easy. No.
[01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:48.290]  Nose.
[01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:50.770]  Double nose sucks.
[01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:53.950]  I think butthole.
[01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:57.590]  Double diarrhea.
[01:11:58.830 --> 01:11:59.830]  Oh, that's bad too.
[01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:01.710]  Here's the problem with the nose though, and this is like
[01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:03.510]  a well discussed topic.
[01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:05.910]  Your nose is in the perfect spot. There's
[01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:08.150]  no other place for a nose to be
[01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:09.850]  that would be as
[01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:12.170]  convenient. So the idea of
[01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:14.050]  a double nose being anywhere else is
[01:12:14.050 --> 01:12:15.730]  terrible. I think instead of
[01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:18.130]  being centered between your eyes, you just have
[01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:20.190]  a nose below each eye. Oh no.
[01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:22.130]  That's pretty good. And then you have
[01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:23.310]  like stereo smell.
[01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:26.370]  And you would think it was weird and gross
[01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:28.170]  until you found the first person with
[01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:29.910]  two noses that you thought was hot, and then suddenly
[01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:31.390]  you'd get very used to it very quickly.
[01:12:32.150 --> 01:12:33.990]  I always thought that taste buds
[01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:35.990]  were in the perfect spot, and that the worst
[01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:37.870]  other place that they could go would be like the palm
[01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:39.590]  of your hands. Oh yeah.
[01:12:39.850 --> 01:12:41.570]  You'd just be like sucking doorknobs.
[01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:43.970]  You know where I used to want taste buds to be?
[01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:46.030]  I used to want them to be on the roof of my mouth
[01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:47.190]  because of hamburgers.
[01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:49.950]  Oh. When I was a kid, I always
[01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:51.950]  bugged me that I would eat a cheeseburger, but I
[01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:53.990]  would never taste the cheese because it's
[01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:55.910]  up. And so I would try to eat my hamburger
[01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:58.050]  upside down so that I could
[01:12:58.050 --> 01:13:00.050]  get more cheese into my bite,
[01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:01.970]  but then like stuff starts to fall
[01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:03.950]  out. And I always thought when I was a kid, why the fuck aren't
[01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:05.910]  my taste buds up top where the cheese is?
[01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:08.090]  I feel like those taste buds would be specifically
[01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:10.110]  for cheese and peanut butter.
[01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:10.910]  Mmmm.
[01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:14.110]  Seems like we should be able to evolve
[01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:14.730]  that, right?
[01:13:15.730 --> 01:13:17.770]  I appreciate that you were eating the cheeseburger
[01:13:17.770 --> 01:13:20.110]  backwards instead of just putting the cheese on the bottom.
[01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:21.970]  What am I gonna do? Go to fucking Wendy's
[01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:23.970]  and be like, can you please put my cheese on the
[01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:25.530]  bottom please? I'm nine. No.
[01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:27.950]  Yeah, why not? Absolutely
[01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:29.790]  you can. Not everybody's Andrew Panton.
[01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:32.190]  Not everybody's figuring out how to hack fast food restaurants
[01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:34.630]  as a child. I don't feel like that's a big ask.
[01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:36.450]  Any ask
[01:13:36.450 --> 01:13:38.350]  of a grown up by me as a kid was a
[01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:39.870]  big ask. That's fair. That's a good
[01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:41.950]  point by Nick. Why is all of the
[01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:44.230]  pizza ingredients on the top where you don't
[01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:46.170]  taste them as well? Do you have to turn it?
[01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:48.250]  You flip it over in your mouth? Have we all been eating
[01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:50.290]  pizza the wrong way? I think that's why they made
[01:13:50.290 --> 01:13:52.290]  calzones, right? Well, that's all on the inside
[01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:53.290]  though, isn't it? Yeah.
[01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:56.470]  What's in your favorite calzone? What's an ideal calzone
[01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:58.330]  for you? I don't give a shit. It's all
[01:13:58.330 --> 01:13:59.970]  the same. I feel like
[01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:01.910]  a calzone is one of the few
[01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:04.030]  things that you- the idea is so much
[01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:05.870]  better than the execution. Oh, I love
[01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:07.910]  calzones. I disagree. It's never as good
[01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.350]  as a pizza of the same thing, though.
[01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:12.030]  On occasion. If you get a good calzone,
[01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:14.190]  it is. But they're few and far between.
[01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:16.110]  Geoff's suddenly having calzone opinions.
[01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.990]  Fascinating. I've had
[01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:19.850]  calzone opinions my whole life, dude. I'm no
[01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:21.430]  stranger to calzones.
[01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:23.990]  I never claimed you were a stranger. You just seem very, like,
[01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:25.870]  I don't give a fuck about calzones, what's in, or
[01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:28.010]  whatever, and all of a sudden you're like, oh, there's- I mean, I just think
[01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:29.950]  they're kind of bog standard. I'm with Gavin, but I will
[01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:32.110]  say that I've had calzones that have been, like,
[01:14:32.210 --> 01:14:33.590]  above and beyond before.
[01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:35.910]  I've had calzones that are so good
[01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:38.010]  that they make me continue to order calzones
[01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:39.950]  that I can continually
[01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:41.530]  be like, ah, I should've just got the pizza.
[01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:44.090]  Which is what I think nine times out of ten when I get a calzone.
[01:14:44.370 --> 01:14:46.030]  Right, that's- But you get, like, one or two fuckin',
[01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:47.750]  like, just top-tier calzones,
[01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:50.150]  that alone will convince
[01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:51.970]  you to fuckin' search out another
[01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:54.230]  twenty or thirty before you- I need to find
[01:14:54.230 --> 01:14:56.090]  my calzone, then, because every time I get
[01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:57.850]  one, I'm like, ah, the pizza version would've been better.
[01:14:58.330 --> 01:15:00.090]  I like a calzone because you can go into
[01:15:00.090 --> 01:15:01.530]  battle with a calzone.
[01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:04.170]  And you don't need to worry about it. You can't take a pizza
[01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:05.850]  into a fight. There's a portability
[01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:08.290]  with a calzone that makes it unique.
[01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:10.350]  Same with a Cornish pasty. It's secure,
[01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:11.930]  everything's packed in,
[01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:14.090]  it's great. Uh, where to eat the world's
[01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:16.110]  best calzone pizza? Uh, what?
[01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:18.090]  Uh, oh, Antica, Naples,
[01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:19.970]  Italy. What are you, what in error? What is a cor-
[01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:22.290]  what is a Cornish pa- pasty?
[01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:23.750]  Cornish pasty? It's like a
[01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:25.570]  much more flaky, it's like,
[01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:27.770]  imagine a calzone but with very flaky pastry
[01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:29.890]  and, like, meat and peas
[01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:31.170]  and shit inside a potato.
[01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:32.330]  Oh, nevermind.
[01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:35.130]  Maybe not peas so much, but...
[01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:37.790]  Now, Cornish, that's, I always hear of, like, a Cornish
[01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:39.790]  game hen. That is a type of
[01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:41.830]  chicken, right? And not, has very
[01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:43.190]  little to do with corn itself.
[01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:45.310]  Cornish is usually from Cornwall.
[01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:47.630]  Really? Oh! It's a region
[01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:49.230]  thing. Yeah, it's like the southwest
[01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:51.110]  of England. I didn't know that.
[01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:52.410]  I had no idea.
[01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:55.370]  But I think, I think a Cornish
[01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:57.270]  pasty, and this could just be one of those
[01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:58.850]  old, uh, wives tales,
[01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:01.250]  where they would send Cornish pasties down
[01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:03.130]  the mines, and you didn't have to worry about
[01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:05.090]  cleaning, or getting, like,
[01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:07.170]  coal and shit all over your food, cause you could
[01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:09.250]  just take a bite out of the corner, and then just suck
[01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.490]  the filling out. The worst food experience
[01:16:11.490 --> 01:16:13.250]  in the mines was whenever a bean hole would
[01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:14.230]  fall from the sky.
[01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:16.770]  It's dangerous, it's a real
[01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:19.130]  talking mine food, so you gotta watch out for the beans.
[01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:21.170]  Didn't we film a ghost
[01:16:21.170 --> 01:16:23.270]  hunt show where, about dudes that fell
[01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:25.010]  in a mine transporting
[01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:27.290]  food to each other? And we did a thing
[01:16:27.290 --> 01:16:29.150]  where we had a pizza go down with a little
[01:16:29.150 --> 01:16:30.990]  parachute? Do you remember that, Gav? Yeah!
[01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.550]  Yeah!
[01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:37.110]  I just got
[01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:39.210]  the weirdest fucking deja vu
[01:16:39.210 --> 01:16:41.030]  as Andrew, as Andrew started describing,
[01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:42.990]  he started talking about food in the mines, and I was like, we
[01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:45.170]  filmed this! I was gonna say,
[01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:47.290]  it's incre- if you ever send
[01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:49.190]  a pizza via parachute and don't
[01:16:49.190 --> 01:16:51.110]  remember that, you've had quite the life.
[01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:53.150]  That would definitely
[01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:55.290]  be an instant I remember, that is
[01:16:55.290 --> 01:16:56.670]  not a usual occurrence.
[01:16:58.670 --> 01:16:59.350]  That's a good
[01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:01.330]  point. I think that was the
[01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:03.150]  very last thing we
[01:17:03.150 --> 01:17:05.170]  ever filmed for Haunter,
[01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:06.590]  actually. You might be right.
[01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:09.130]  Do you think if you were a miner, and you lived
[01:17:09.130 --> 01:17:11.330]  or worked underground, would you go
[01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:13.290]  for the bean hole in the ground or in the ceiling?
[01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:15.390]  Ground. You would just put
[01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:17.390]  it even further down in the ground? Yeah.
[01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:19.470]  Yeah, I think so. I like the way you're thinking.
[01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:20.870]  I think we should go ceiling bean hole.
[01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:23.310]  Because if you flip the pot upside down,
[01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:25.450]  you could potentially have a gravity
[01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:26.770]  fed bean dispenser.
[01:17:27.090 --> 01:17:29.530]  Alright, so anyway, I changed my mind
[01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:30.650]  and we can put it in the ground now.
[01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:32.490]  Well, now I'm kinda
[01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:35.010]  like what Gavin's going with it. It's kinda like
[01:17:35.010 --> 01:17:37.370]  how you feed a hamster. Yeah, imagine a little tap.
[01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:39.670]  Water, right? I don't trust it.
[01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:41.390]  I live in
[01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:43.270]  a world of acme where anything metal
[01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:45.450]  above me that can fall is an instant death
[01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:46.910]  so I want that in the ground.
[01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:48.170]  Just think of like a
[01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:51.390]  plastic or a metal nozzle that comes out
[01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:53.290]  it's at mouth height. You put your mouth on it
[01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:54.610]  and then you spin a wheel
[01:17:55.090 --> 01:17:57.110]  slowly. It releases beans
[01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:58.730]  at the speed that you're comfortable with.
[01:17:59.910 --> 01:18:01.070]  Close it back up
[01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:03.330]  and much like a Cornish pasty
[01:18:03.330 --> 01:18:04.750]  your hands are fucking
[01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:07.530]  dry of food and you didn't end up eating a bunch of coal.
[01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:09.190]  I was imagining it like
[01:18:09.190 --> 01:18:10.410]  airport nuts.
[01:18:11.650 --> 01:18:12.370]  That seems
[01:18:12.370 --> 01:18:12.930]  too dangerous.
[01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:15.410]  I think you just go straight into the mouth.
[01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:18.470]  I love the idea of a miner accidentally connecting
[01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:20.430]  with the bean hole reserve and beans
[01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:22.030]  just flying out of the wall.
[01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:24.430]  He's trying to clear some
[01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:26.150]  rocks and just get raining beans.
[01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:27.730]  You hit the bean vein.
[01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.090]  Oh Christ.
[01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:38.410]  Does that feel like
[01:18:38.410 --> 01:18:40.390]  a better ending to the episode now that we're all
[01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:41.870]  together and we know Andrew didn't die?
[01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:43.690]  I feel good about it. I think so.
[01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:45.830]  Alright, I like it.
[01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:48.470]  I just want to give the audience an hour of Andrew.
[01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:50.450]  Yeah, well how much additional
[01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:52.290]  time did we... I'm not looking at my recording.
[01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:54.510]  Eleven, twelve minutes. We've given them an extra
[01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:56.270]  twelve minutes. Andrew, you got another
[01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:57.530]  two or three minutes in you?
[01:18:58.050 --> 01:19:00.050]  Oh, absolutely I did. Alright, take it away.
[01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:02.630]  What were you gonna talk about last week that you didn't?
[01:19:02.890 --> 01:19:03.750]  Or two days ago, whatever.
[01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:06.290]  I don't even remember that but what I am thinking about
[01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:08.210]  now is what pizza has the best chance of
[01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:09.850]  survival in a parachute situation.
[01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:12.490]  Because I'm typically a pepperoni guy
[01:19:12.490 --> 01:19:14.630]  but I don't know if I would trust pepperoni
[01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:16.450]  on top. But I feel like that's
[01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:18.310]  like the base pizza for
[01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:20.310]  travel. I think pepperoni is the
[01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:22.030]  only way you can do it.
[01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:24.390]  Because the pepperoni and the cheese together
[01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:26.490]  create a latticework that hold it all together.
[01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:28.450]  I think any other ingredients falling off
[01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:30.170]  like sausages, you're fucked, right?
[01:19:31.150 --> 01:19:32.170]  Yeah. And then if you
[01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:34.190]  just have cheese, I can just see the cheese
[01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:36.470]  sliding right down. I think something about the pepperoni
[01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:38.130]  is gonna hold it in. Now do you think
[01:19:38.130 --> 01:19:40.150]  the stuffed crust would at all change the
[01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:42.230]  scenario of what you could possibly be working with?
[01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:44.310]  It would be heavier. I feel like
[01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:46.210]  it might absorb, I think by stuffing the
[01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:47.890]  crust it might protect the toppings more.
[01:19:48.090 --> 01:19:50.230]  Like it's a crash pad, essentially, for the pizza.
[01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:51.890]  I'm imagining one of those
[01:19:52.810 --> 01:19:54.210]  like buoyant things in the
[01:19:54.210 --> 01:19:56.210]  ocean that the heroes of films get
[01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:58.310]  picked up on at the end. Oh, yeah.
[01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:03.490]  Now that is an idea.
[01:20:03.630 --> 01:20:05.630]  A survivability raft that's a calzone.
[01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:07.550]  You just slowly eat.
[01:20:09.230 --> 01:20:10.290]  You're the ingredients.
[01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:11.410]  It's just the shell.
[01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:15.090]  Are there any dessert calzones?
[01:20:15.890 --> 01:20:17.510]  No. That's called a crepe.
[01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:18.390]  Fuckin' idiot.
[01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:20.590]  That was ridiculous. I'm sorry.
[01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:22.550]  I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
[01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:23.910]  That was a joke.
[01:20:24.630 --> 01:20:26.210]  That was in my head. I thought
[01:20:26.210 --> 01:20:27.890]  that'd be such a ridiculous thing to be
[01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:28.290]  mean about.
[01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:30.850]  I wanted that reaction from Nick.
[01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:32.570]  Are you having phantom appendix
[01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:33.230]  pains again?
[01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:35.670]  We gotta end the show.
[01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:38.550]  The question
[01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:40.370]  I had asked you, Andrew, that I never
[01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:42.070]  heard the answer from that we were talking about
[01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:44.370]  was, I had recently
[01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:46.350]  read or learned that people have
[01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:48.310]  like, culturally we have a
[01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:49.910]  50 year memory. And anything
[01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:52.010]  that's older than 50 years disappears
[01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:54.050]  from our understanding.
[01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:55.530]  Like it might as well have never happened.
[01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:57.450]  And that applies to celebrities.
[01:20:57.690 --> 01:20:59.390]  And we're just talking about how very few celebrities
[01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:01.570]  are going to survive 50 years from now
[01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:03.730]  and still be remembered. And I was just asking
[01:21:03.730 --> 01:21:05.570]  if you had any... I think what I wanted
[01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:07.450]  to do was ask who you thought would survive
[01:21:07.450 --> 01:21:08.990]  the... I guess
[01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:11.270]  the test of time. That's a
[01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:13.770]  great question. Like Taylor Swift probably
[01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:15.470]  will make it. But like, nobody's gonna
[01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.310]  remember Mark Ruffalo
[01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:19.530]  50 years from now. You know who's gonna
[01:21:19.530 --> 01:21:21.650]  get lost to time that it's like a real
[01:21:21.650 --> 01:21:23.350]  goddamn shame that they will because they're
[01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:25.370]  great and everything they're in. I have an immediate
[01:21:25.370 --> 01:21:27.350]  answer to this. Uh, Eric
[01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:28.970]  will be eternal. Gooch Gooch?
[01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:30.910]  You kidding me? What the fuck?
[01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:33.250]  My answer is John Hawks.
[01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:35.190]  John Hawks is such a great actor.
[01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:37.270]  He's in so many things. I already
[01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:38.990]  know who he is. I don't know who that is now, yeah.
[01:21:39.670 --> 01:21:41.050]  Yeah, well he's...
[01:21:41.050 --> 01:21:43.330]  You may know him from Blue Streak, but if you look
[01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:45.230]  him up, he's in... he's a dramatic
[01:21:45.230 --> 01:21:46.930]  actor typically. He was in
[01:21:46.930 --> 01:21:49.270]  Eastbound and Down as Danny
[01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:51.490]  McBride's brother. He is a
[01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.450]  Oh yeah, I know who that dude is. Absolutely.
[01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:55.010]  Yeah, he's really good. He's a
[01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:57.390]  fantastic actor that
[01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:59.110]  just has never had like
[01:21:59.110 --> 01:22:01.530]  that role where everyone's like, oh yeah, that guy. He's like
[01:22:01.530 --> 01:22:03.430]  the guy you walk out of the movie from and go like
[01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:05.210]  he was fucking good, but you don't know who he is.
[01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:07.530]  John Hawks will not stand. Yeah.
[01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:09.770]  He's certainly fucked historically,
[01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:11.350]  but then, but I mean like I'm thinking
[01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:13.010]  like Sandra Bullock, uh
[01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:15.390]  people like that level won't be remembered either.
[01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:17.310]  You know? That's true. I think, well
[01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:19.410]  I also think Mark Ruffalo will be remembered.
[01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:21.310]  He may be. You always remember
[01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:23.250]  the names of people who have played superheroes.
[01:22:23.650 --> 01:22:25.290]  Like you can name all the supermans.
[01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:27.230]  I completely agree. Yeah, I think
[01:22:27.230 --> 01:22:29.230]  because of the Marvel thing. Who was the first superman?
[01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:31.410]  Uh. Oh, what's his name? It was someone
[01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:32.970]  similar to Reeves, wasn't it?
[01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:35.390]  You don't remember it, is the answer.
[01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:37.030]  I know that. You see, you don't always
[01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:39.650]  remember the very first fucking superman.
[01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:41.350]  And the only superman for
[01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:43.270]  like 40 years. Well, it was
[01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:45.330]  TV, wasn't it? Yeah, but he was the original
[01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:47.350]  superman. And I guarantee you don't remember the lady who
[01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:49.970]  played Lois Lane. Oh, he was Ben Affleck, right?
[01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:51.190]  Was the original superman?
[01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:53.730]  It was George Reeves was the original superman.
[01:22:54.130 --> 01:22:55.370]  Yeah. And then Christopher Reeve.
[01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:57.150]  Do you remember all the superheroes
[01:22:57.150 --> 01:22:59.490]  that existed within the 50 years
[01:22:59.490 --> 01:23:01.190]  that you've been alive? I guess
[01:23:01.190 --> 01:23:03.170]  my point is
[01:23:03.170 --> 01:23:05.390]  to that, you can google that.
[01:23:05.530 --> 01:23:07.530]  Like that's a very naturally googleable
[01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:09.350]  thing and a thing that people in the future
[01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:11.550]  will learn. Nobody's looking up
[01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:13.590]  who was henchman three in Blue Streak.
[01:23:13.810 --> 01:23:15.130]  Like that's. Yeah.
[01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:17.070]  John Hawks is. You can't keep
[01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:19.050]  using Blue Streak as a touchstone.
[01:23:19.290 --> 01:23:21.230]  That was the first thing I saw of it as a
[01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:21.530]  kid.
[01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:25.170]  Is that the movie where they hid the diamond and it
[01:23:25.170 --> 01:23:26.530]  became a police station?
[01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:27.430]  Yeah, it is.
[01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:31.270]  You just keep using it as a touchstone.
[01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:33.130]  He plays Martin Lawrence's
[01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:35.270]  best friend who is on the crew
[01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:36.590]  and he gets murdered
[01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:38.810]  by the evil members of the crew.
[01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:40.770]  He was the good guy of the criminals
[01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:42.870]  that doesn't make it out of the first act.
[01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:44.450]  I was thinking about that in a different sense.
[01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:46.650]  So you may remember that.
[01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:49.010]  Yeah, well I will but I'm saying history
[01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:50.910]  won't. I would say that people don't remember
[01:23:50.910 --> 01:23:52.670]  henchman three of current movies.
[01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:55.090]  What I was thinking about in sort of relation to this
[01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:56.970]  is how weird it will be
[01:23:56.970 --> 01:23:59.130]  when the entire cast of Fast and Furious
[01:23:59.130 --> 01:24:00.990]  is dead and that I will most
[01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:02.210]  likely be alive for that.
[01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:05.130]  There will be a time in which all of the actors
[01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:07.030]  will have died. You think you're gonna outlive
[01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:08.370]  like Michelle Rodriguez?
[01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:10.890]  Oh 100% I'm gonna outlive Michelle Rodriguez.
[01:24:11.610 --> 01:24:12.890]  Easily. Really?
[01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:14.450]  Yeah he's gonna make sure of it. Absolutely.
[01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:16.950]  Yeah. I mean she's pretty young
[01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:18.650]  right? No she's
[01:24:18.650 --> 01:24:20.750]  probably close to my age
[01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:21.470]  maybe? Yeah.
[01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:25.110]  Early 40s? She was pretty young in the first one.
[01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:26.970]  And also, well the first
[01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:28.050]  one was 100 years ago.
[01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:30.250]  She's 45.
[01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:30.930]  Yeah.
[01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:34.470]  Also she's in fantastic shape
[01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:36.110]  and seems to take very good care of herself.
[01:24:37.730 --> 01:24:39.010]  I think she's probably
[01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:40.990]  fingers crossed
[01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:41.970]  she makes it for a while.
[01:24:42.450 --> 01:24:45.010]  Yeah I'm not wishing death upon any of these people
[01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:46.870]  in the near future. If I were a
[01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:48.810]  major player in Fast and Furious
[01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:50.890]  I'd be watching my fucking back now after
[01:24:50.890 --> 01:24:51.130]  Andrew.
[01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:55.090]  Where were you when Paul Walker
[01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:55.430]  died?
[01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:58.910]  I was thinking about
[01:24:58.910 --> 01:25:01.270]  his work in Into the Blue. That's where I was.
[01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:02.270]  Underrated film.
[01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:04.450]  I think properly rated.
[01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:06.090]  I feel like everyone
[01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:08.330]  saw Blue Streak.
[01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.670]  And why is that?
[01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:12.410]  It was a TBS for me a lot.
[01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:12.510]  Martin Lawrence?
[01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:15.410]  Yeah it was like a huge movie but it wasn't really
[01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:17.310]  is it like an original IP?
[01:25:18.630 --> 01:25:19.070]  Yeah.
[01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:22.030]  People saw it because it was
[01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:24.450]  Martin Lawrence at kind of the height of his popularity.
[01:25:24.670 --> 01:25:24.810]  Yeah.
[01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.350]  It was when Martin Lawrence was
[01:25:27.930 --> 01:25:29.690]  a big draw at the time.
[01:25:30.190 --> 01:25:32.110]  Which is the best movie with Blue in the title?
[01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:34.210]  Blue Brothers? It's not Blue Crush starring Michelle
[01:25:34.210 --> 01:25:35.690]  Rodriguez. I'll tell you that much.
[01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:37.770]  Movies with Blue in the title.
[01:25:38.090 --> 01:25:39.990]  Blue Valentine is rough.
[01:25:40.330 --> 01:25:41.090]  Blue Velvet. Easily.
[01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:44.030]  Blue Velvet's good. Not Into the Blue.
[01:25:46.290 --> 01:25:46.470]  I think
[01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:48.030]  that's the first time I saw Josh Brolin.
[01:25:48.330 --> 01:25:49.650]  It's Into the Blue. It's a villain.
[01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:51.230]  You didn't see him in Goonies?
[01:25:52.050 --> 01:25:53.510]  Well I don't think I saw Goonies
[01:25:54.090 --> 01:25:55.890]  I think I saw Into the Blue first.
[01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:58.010]  I've definitely seen Goonies. Was there a Blue Heat?
[01:25:58.450 --> 01:26:00.030]  If there wasn't we should make it.
[01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:02.290]  There's a
[01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:03.850]  lot of shit called Blue apparently.
[01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:06.050]  Now
[01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:08.130]  we should wrap up. Blue Brothers!
[01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:10.030]  Blue Lagoon!
[01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:12.370]  Blue's Clues!
[01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:14.270]  Biloxi Blues. Deep Blue Sea
[01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:16.230]  was a good movie. Holy shit there's a bunch of
[01:26:16.230 --> 01:26:17.910]  Blue movies. Blue Sky.
[01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:19.850]  Best use of Blue? Chris Penn.
[01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:21.610]  Reservoir Dogs.
[01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.630]  Fantastic.
[01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:25.630]  Out of the fucking Blue!
[01:26:26.650 --> 01:26:28.150]  Such a great delivery.
[01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:30.190]  Anyway we should wrap this up because this is
[01:26:30.190 --> 01:26:32.110]  a close thing and we're almost at like 20 minutes.
[01:26:32.490 --> 01:26:34.290]  My Blue Heaven with Rick Moranis
[01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:36.210]  and Steve Martin. Oh yeah!
[01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:37.970]  I'm excited to know what that is.
[01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:40.350]  Are you serious? Oh my god. Rick Moranis
[01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:42.070]  is an FBI agent. Steve Martin
[01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:44.290]  is a mob guy. He turns
[01:26:44.290 --> 01:26:46.050]  state's evidence and rats on the mob.
[01:26:46.530 --> 01:26:48.110]  Oh I'm feeling pain!
[01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:50.090]  My pain's... Oh I gotta...
[01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:52.090]  Oh the pain! We should wrap it up. Andrew's
[01:26:52.090 --> 01:26:54.310]  hurting again man. We gotta end this thing.
[01:26:54.490 --> 01:26:56.370]  So then he has to move into the suburbs
[01:26:56.370 --> 01:26:58.130]  and he's like a fish out of water
[01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:00.470]  but Steve Martin is like a funny New Yorker guy.
[01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:02.010]  We're gonna love it.
[01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:04.330]  We'll see you next time. Thanks for listening.
[01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:06.370]  Andrew just died. We're gonna go make funeral
[01:27:06.370 --> 01:27:07.650]  arrangements. Bye bye!
[01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:09.070]  You're next Vin Diesel.
[01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:12.310]  Hey guys.
[01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:14.090]  Major League Fan Jack here with a look at
[01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:16.110]  next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:18.270]  Toothpaste life hacks. It's cold
[01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:20.110]  outside. Eyeballs are weird.
[01:27:20.490 --> 01:27:21.830]  Did you know a marathon is roughly
[01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:24.110]  65,000 steps that Andrew hasn't
[01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:26.370]  taken yet? Who remembers the Animorphs?
[01:27:26.370 --> 01:27:28.490]  Let's make some beverages. Is it time
[01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:30.350]  for another Halo bet? And once
[01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:32.050]  again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:27:32.370 --> 01:27:34.370]  All that and more on next week's episode of
[01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:34.930]  F*** Face.
