[00:10.140 --> 00:14.000]  I wonder how many balloons I could fill with a can of compressed air.
[00:14.320 --> 00:17.560]  It's a great question. I don't know that it's a great question, but it's an interesting question.
[00:18.480 --> 00:22.160]  Hello, and welcome to the F*** Face Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:22.240 --> 00:25.820]  With me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free. This is what?
[00:25.900 --> 00:30.260]  Episode 192, I believe? Is that right? Shit, did I get that right?
[00:30.440 --> 00:31.620]  Is it? Is it? Guys, is it episode 192?
[00:31.640 --> 00:33.620]  You're going in and out of the fish tank for me.
[00:33.820 --> 00:35.760]  You can hear him, but only kind of, right?
[00:35.960 --> 00:39.140]  Yeah, like, he sounds fine for a minute, and then he goes underwater.
[00:39.140 --> 00:40.620]  And then he emerges again.
[00:40.780 --> 00:42.740]  Oh, you guys are having a problem with my audio?
[00:43.440 --> 00:44.600]  Now you sound good.
[00:44.680 --> 00:48.120]  Yeah, there's something wrong with all of our audios.
[00:48.880 --> 00:51.420]  Oh, do you guys want me to stop down and reboot?
[00:52.160 --> 00:52.480]  No.
[00:52.880 --> 00:55.080]  I can do that real fast. Hold on, I'll be back in like five minutes.
[00:55.140 --> 00:56.420]  Let me shut everything down and reboot.
[00:57.200 --> 00:58.980]  What's going on? Geoff's having a bad day.
[00:59.600 --> 01:01.260]  I don't know, Geoff's in a bad mood.
[01:01.500 --> 01:03.720]  No, I'm in a great mood, but they said my audio's messed up.
[01:03.900 --> 01:04.920]  So I need to probably...
[01:04.920 --> 01:06.140]  Then we said you sound fine now.
[01:06.140 --> 01:07.100]  Sounds good to me.
[01:07.220 --> 01:10.800]  Yeah, I mean, we were just mostly confused about the bit you've been doing the last ten minutes.
[01:11.040 --> 01:12.140]  Uh, I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:13.720 --> 01:15.440]  Coming into the chat and then leaving.
[01:15.900 --> 01:19.020]  I think he was trying to sync with Gavin perfectly, was my guess.
[01:19.520 --> 01:19.800]  Oh.
[01:20.680 --> 01:21.600]  Is that what you were trying to do?
[01:22.220 --> 01:23.020]  Yeah, I don't...
[01:23.020 --> 01:24.300]  I'm not sure what you guys are talking about.
[01:24.340 --> 01:25.920]  I'm just here to do the f***face episode.
[01:26.080 --> 01:27.120]  Is it 192?
[01:27.740 --> 01:29.400]  And then you guys said that there was maybe something wrong.
[01:29.480 --> 01:30.640]  I sounded like I was in a fish tank.
[01:30.760 --> 01:33.680]  I just want to make sure that my audio is good.
[01:34.060 --> 01:36.140]  Alright, so we can just keep going.
[01:36.260 --> 01:36.920]  We don't have to stop now.
[01:37.000 --> 01:37.660]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39.840 --> 01:41.040]  How's everybody doing today?
[01:41.760 --> 01:43.640]  I'm doing fantastic. How are you doing, Geoff?
[01:44.060 --> 01:45.360]  I'm good. How did the...
[01:45.360 --> 01:47.480]  You guys played Payday 3 today? How did that recording go?
[01:47.600 --> 01:49.520]  Oh, it's so much fun. It was a great time.
[01:49.840 --> 01:51.080]  Can't wait to make more of them.
[01:51.400 --> 01:51.580]  Really?
[01:52.580 --> 01:54.560]  We used to play 2 a lot in Achievement Hunter.
[01:54.740 --> 01:57.800]  I remember when 3 launched, I got kind of excited about it.
[01:57.840 --> 01:59.580]  But I guess it launched with some bugs or something.
[01:59.940 --> 02:02.120]  So I held off on downloading it.
[02:02.120 --> 02:03.460]  Yeah, I did the same.
[02:03.680 --> 02:06.540]  It does the thing I don't like where you have to make an account
[02:06.540 --> 02:09.040]  on their own platform before you can play it.
[02:09.240 --> 02:10.080]  Which is always annoying.
[02:10.300 --> 02:12.160]  But once you get through that, great time.
[02:12.540 --> 02:13.720]  Definitely going to be making more of those.
[02:13.800 --> 02:14.840]  That wasn't annoying as shit.
[02:14.980 --> 02:17.360]  It is always annoying. I don't know why companies still do that.
[02:17.480 --> 02:20.780]  I guess it's helpful for cross-play stuff, but it's not...
[02:20.780 --> 02:23.140]  Nobody wants to be immediately greeted by that.
[02:23.660 --> 02:24.320]  No, it's like...
[02:24.320 --> 02:26.360]  It just guarantees that I'm going to block
[02:26.360 --> 02:28.320]  whatever email address they email me.
[02:28.320 --> 02:28.620]  Yes.
[02:28.620 --> 02:30.780]  It also is like, maybe let me
[02:30.780 --> 02:32.240]  make that choice.
[02:32.400 --> 02:34.800]  If I want to make cross-play more
[02:34.800 --> 02:36.960]  inconvenient for me, let me
[02:36.960 --> 02:39.100]  do that. Don't force me to
[02:39.100 --> 02:40.840]  go into this system.
[02:41.160 --> 02:43.040]  I want to pick my own inconvenience.
[02:43.340 --> 02:43.900]  Yeah!
[02:44.560 --> 02:45.780]  Absolutely I do.
[02:46.760 --> 02:48.960]  Yeah, let me inconvenience myself. How about that?
[02:49.360 --> 02:49.900]  What episode?
[02:51.240 --> 02:51.800]  192.
[02:52.580 --> 02:55.040]  I might have said that during the fishbowl time.
[02:55.380 --> 02:56.900]  It's episode 192.
[02:56.900 --> 02:59.380]  I had a question for you, Gavin.
[02:59.580 --> 03:01.060]  If I had a thought
[03:01.060 --> 03:03.140]  and it's kind of science-related
[03:03.140 --> 03:05.180]  and I view you as a science
[03:05.180 --> 03:07.100]  guy, could I send you
[03:07.100 --> 03:09.140]  on a science mission and then
[03:09.140 --> 03:10.780]  maybe have you report back to me?
[03:11.060 --> 03:12.100]  Are you sending me into the lab?
[03:12.500 --> 03:14.860]  I kind of want to send you into the lab
[03:14.860 --> 03:15.740]  if that's okay.
[03:16.920 --> 03:17.160]  Sure.
[03:17.320 --> 03:20.980]  Do you remember, and this is a really random
[03:20.980 --> 03:22.840]  thought, do you remember Owl City?
[03:23.540 --> 03:25.120]  The band Owl City?
[03:25.120 --> 03:25.960]  No.
[03:27.920 --> 03:29.040]  The Fireflies?
[03:29.520 --> 03:30.080]  What?
[03:31.160 --> 03:33.320]  You would not believe your eyes
[03:33.320 --> 03:35.300]  if 10 million fireflies
[03:35.300 --> 03:35.720]  Oh!
[03:36.760 --> 03:38.580]  I remember muting that a few times, yeah.
[03:40.060 --> 03:41.300]  There's a TikTok
[03:41.300 --> 03:43.600]  song that a woman released recently
[03:43.600 --> 03:45.260]  who is sick and it has a line
[03:45.260 --> 03:47.340]  in it about fireflies and it made me think
[03:47.340 --> 03:49.560]  how bright would 10,000
[03:49.560 --> 03:50.580]  fireflies be?
[03:51.120 --> 03:53.200]  Could you do a flashlight
[03:53.200 --> 03:55.680]  that would actually, cause in my head
[03:55.680 --> 03:56.760]  it's very magical
[03:57.400 --> 03:58.980]  but I would love to know
[03:58.980 --> 04:01.080]  what the actual brightness of
[04:01.080 --> 04:03.060]  10 million fireflies is.
[04:03.500 --> 04:04.960]  Does it stack or are they all just
[04:04.960 --> 04:06.420]  the same thing that's big?
[04:06.420 --> 04:07.420]  I think it stacks.
[04:08.340 --> 04:10.080]  How does it stack?
[04:10.620 --> 04:12.000]  I think it would build, would it not?
[04:12.940 --> 04:15.080]  Are a hundred flashlights
[04:15.080 --> 04:16.640]  brighter than one flashlight?
[04:16.880 --> 04:18.260]  Or do they just cover more ground?
[04:18.440 --> 04:20.560]  First you need to determine how much light
[04:20.560 --> 04:22.860]  a firefly generates and then times
[04:22.860 --> 04:24.560]  that by
[04:24.560 --> 04:26.940]  10 million. I want to see what 10 million
[04:26.940 --> 04:28.780]  I want to see what the light of
[04:28.780 --> 04:30.680]  10 million. First off, I thought it was 10,000
[04:31.160 --> 04:32.080]  That's 10 million?
[04:32.500 --> 04:34.120]  It's 10 million, I believe.
[04:34.780 --> 04:36.620]  Okay, you did say 1,000 earlier
[04:36.620 --> 04:37.720]  but that's fine. I did?
[04:39.620 --> 04:40.620]  You also said
[04:40.620 --> 04:42.180]  fireflies, so I let that slip.
[04:42.220 --> 04:44.260]  Dude, I'm having such a bad word day today
[04:44.260 --> 04:46.800]  as you know. It's been a struggle
[04:46.800 --> 04:48.380]  but I think it's
[04:48.380 --> 04:49.640]  Is it 10,000?
[04:50.260 --> 04:52.580]  Somebody pull up the Owl City lyrics
[04:52.580 --> 04:53.440]  for fireflies.
[04:53.920 --> 04:55.500]  Nick said 10 million
[04:56.020 --> 04:57.000]  It is 10 million.
[04:57.240 --> 04:59.840]  He definitely said 10,000 a few times
[05:00.340 --> 05:01.600]  Absolutely, I did it.
[05:01.920 --> 05:03.640]  I've never heard of this song before
[05:03.640 --> 05:06.380]  10 million, I want to know the 10 million brightness
[05:06.380 --> 05:08.420]  and then I think there's a line in it
[05:08.420 --> 05:10.200]  about tears
[05:10.200 --> 05:11.820]  if they all cried
[05:11.820 --> 05:13.720]  I want to know how much liquid
[05:13.720 --> 05:15.680]  if all the fireflies cried
[05:15.680 --> 05:17.560]  Would it be a waterfall?
[05:18.180 --> 05:19.160]  Is it a pool?
[05:19.820 --> 05:22.120]  You assume it would be vast. Is it an ocean?
[05:23.280 --> 05:23.940]  How many tears?
[05:24.200 --> 05:26.240]  How much water is in a tear?
[05:26.580 --> 05:27.800]  What's the count of a tear?
[05:28.320 --> 05:29.640]  This would be such a good video
[05:29.640 --> 05:31.700]  for Cardo Crew to do a CG
[05:31.700 --> 05:33.740]  like a literal recreation
[05:33.740 --> 05:34.960]  of shitty lyrics
[05:34.960 --> 05:37.760]  It would, but I'm sending this mission to you
[05:37.760 --> 05:40.000]  You can't figure it out, I understand
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.500]  You're just science guy in my head
[05:41.500 --> 05:44.020]  The light thing feels like a science thing
[05:44.020 --> 05:46.880]  How many, are there 10 million fireflies?
[05:47.380 --> 05:48.380]  Oh yeah, easily
[05:48.380 --> 05:49.480]  There probably are, right?
[05:49.560 --> 05:51.000]  There's probably 10 billion fireflies
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.740]  Used to be
[05:53.520 --> 05:55.160]  Joel had to go fuck that up
[05:55.160 --> 05:56.380]  Yeah, Joel fucked it up
[05:57.900 --> 06:00.580]  How many fireflies are there in the world?
[06:01.940 --> 06:03.220]  I just see people asking
[06:03.220 --> 06:04.320]  if they're endangered
[06:04.320 --> 06:05.600]  and then a lot of information
[06:05.600 --> 06:06.600]  that says no
[06:07.840 --> 06:09.840]  But I like the idea
[06:09.840 --> 06:11.320]  that the people thinking they're endangered
[06:11.320 --> 06:12.760]  because they haven't seen one
[06:12.760 --> 06:14.720]  because I don't think I've ever seen a firefly
[06:14.720 --> 06:16.340]  Oh really? I see them all the time
[06:16.340 --> 06:18.680]  I thought earwigs got extinct
[06:18.680 --> 06:19.500]  Earwigs?
[06:20.220 --> 06:22.040]  Yeah, I used to see them all the time as a kid
[06:22.040 --> 06:24.660]  and then I swear there was like a 15 year period
[06:24.660 --> 06:25.680]  where I never saw one
[06:25.680 --> 06:27.900]  Is there ear pattern baldness?
[06:28.760 --> 06:29.040]  What?
[06:30.820 --> 06:32.840]  Is there baldness
[06:32.840 --> 06:34.740]  but just around your ear?
[06:34.940 --> 06:35.700]  Is that a possibility?
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.780]  You know how male pattern baldness
[06:37.780 --> 06:39.360]  is like a specific zone
[06:39.360 --> 06:40.640]  of hair loss
[06:40.640 --> 06:43.220]  You said earwig, I thought what if
[06:43.220 --> 06:45.460]  there was like a toupee for ears
[06:45.760 --> 06:46.780]  essentially, specifically
[06:46.780 --> 06:48.580]  like an ear only toupee
[06:48.580 --> 06:51.540]  I feel like ears are the last place you want hair to grow
[06:51.540 --> 06:54.140]  but it's where all the hair ends up
[06:54.140 --> 06:55.180]  as you get to
[06:55.840 --> 06:57.100]  95 years old
[06:57.100 --> 06:59.440]  Yeah, but I'm just saying it would be unfortunate
[06:59.440 --> 07:00.760]  because I don't think there's coverage
[07:00.760 --> 07:03.500]  for if it started going bald on the ears
[07:03.500 --> 07:04.860]  I uh
[07:05.900 --> 07:07.200]  I found a reddit thread
[07:07.200 --> 07:08.820]  that answers this firefly question
[07:08.820 --> 07:11.280]  Oh really? Yeah, I put it
[07:11.280 --> 07:12.820]  in the chat. Oh, did you find it too?
[07:13.220 --> 07:14.720]  Is there a visual representation?
[07:15.660 --> 07:17.040]  This is gonna get
[07:17.040 --> 07:19.200]  it's just called, this is from TheyDidTheMath
[07:20.420 --> 07:21.180]  It says
[07:22.340 --> 07:23.020]  well the first
[07:23.020 --> 07:24.220]  one is how many would cover the earth
[07:24.220 --> 07:27.040]  and then he answers it, it's 4 quintillion
[07:27.040 --> 07:27.600]  fireflies
[07:28.540 --> 07:30.760]  but then he said, but that's not exactly the question
[07:30.760 --> 07:32.940]  the question is how many, 10 million
[07:32.940 --> 07:35.260]  to light up the world, not cover it entirely
[07:35.260 --> 07:37.120]  the question is a little harder due to the vagueness
[07:37.120 --> 07:39.160]  of lighting up the world, but I'm gonna take it
[07:39.160 --> 07:40.980]  to mean that fireflies give off enough light
[07:40.980 --> 07:43.240]  to see the ground around them if it were pitch dark
[07:43.240 --> 07:45.040]  fireflies have a luminescence of about
[07:45.040 --> 07:47.980]  0.0006 lumens
[07:47.980 --> 07:48.760]  humans'
[07:49.000 --> 07:50.620]  scotopic vision, dark vision
[07:50.940 --> 07:53.160]  needs at least 10 to the 4th power
[07:53.160 --> 07:54.780]  cd over m2
[07:54.780 --> 07:56.620]  to function, so theoretically
[07:57.020 --> 07:58.920]  flying about a meter in the air with an
[07:58.920 --> 08:00.940]  apex angle of 135 degrees
[08:00.940 --> 08:03.320]  one firefly could light up about
[08:03.320 --> 08:05.340]  1.457 meters
[08:05.340 --> 08:07.140]  squared, given that we only need
[08:07.140 --> 08:09.120]  a firefly per 1.5
[08:09.120 --> 08:11.060]  meters squared, the new number is actually about
[08:11.060 --> 08:12.760]  330 million fireflies
[08:12.760 --> 08:14.260]  to light up the world
[08:14.930 --> 08:17.100]  they're like nature's plasma pistol
[08:18.100 --> 08:18.640]  yeah
[08:20.100 --> 08:21.140]  there you go
[08:22.960 --> 08:25.380]  but they don't explode if they're on too much
[08:25.380 --> 08:27.300]  you never see a firefly go
[08:27.300 --> 08:28.940]  out because he held his button too long
[08:29.820 --> 08:30.820]  he just shakes
[08:30.820 --> 08:33.480]  and then it all just dissipates
[08:33.480 --> 08:35.340]  out around him. Oh man if fireflies
[08:35.340 --> 08:36.980]  could explode like the plasma pistol
[08:36.980 --> 08:38.040]  that would be so cool
[08:38.040 --> 08:39.540]  that'd be awesome
[08:41.160 --> 08:42.140]  oh man
[08:42.140 --> 08:43.720]  I wish that was a thing
[08:44.560 --> 08:46.860]  so does it ever say how many lumens
[08:46.860 --> 08:48.480]  specifically it would be? yeah
[08:48.480 --> 08:50.360]  0.0006 right?
[08:50.920 --> 08:53.200]  that's per one right? but what's the math
[08:53.200 --> 08:54.180]  so that would mean
[08:55.640 --> 08:57.120]  1600 fireflies approximately
[08:57.120 --> 08:59.320]  would be a lumen
[08:59.320 --> 09:00.060]  yeah
[09:00.060 --> 09:03.520]  I have a flashlight that's 120,000 lumens
[09:03.520 --> 09:04.620]  so
[09:05.040 --> 09:07.100]  if I turn that on that would be the
[09:07.100 --> 09:08.220]  equivalent of 200
[09:09.100 --> 09:10.300]  million fireflies
[09:10.300 --> 09:12.980]  ok so then how big is that?
[09:13.740 --> 09:15.140]  how many lumens did you say that was?
[09:15.400 --> 09:16.300]  120,000
[09:16.300 --> 09:18.980]  120,000 is the equivalent of 200 million
[09:18.980 --> 09:20.140]  which is
[09:20.140 --> 09:23.500]  what 20 times the amount in the song
[09:23.500 --> 09:24.800]  yeah so
[09:25.600 --> 09:26.840]  would that be like 12,000?
[09:26.920 --> 09:28.980]  so I got a 20 hour city
[09:30.140 --> 09:30.660]  flashlight
[09:31.340 --> 09:31.860]  yeah
[09:32.540 --> 09:34.180]  a 20 hour city flashlight
[09:34.180 --> 09:36.400]  can we just like
[09:36.400 --> 09:38.720]  can light be only referred to in fireflies
[09:38.720 --> 09:40.940]  from this point forward like going into a store
[09:40.940 --> 09:41.780]  and be like I'm looking
[09:41.780 --> 09:44.980]  for somewhere between 10 to 20 million fireflies
[09:44.980 --> 09:46.340]  on this flashlight
[09:46.340 --> 09:48.800]  the way they measure light has always confused me
[09:48.800 --> 09:50.720]  because there's like lumens and there's lux
[09:50.720 --> 09:52.120]  and there's like candelas
[09:52.120 --> 09:53.420]  and I don't know
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.580]  what any of it means
[09:55.580 --> 09:57.640]  and then there's like temperature as well
[09:57.640 --> 10:00.540]  I can't even accurately
[10:00.540 --> 10:01.900]  measure my own hand
[10:01.900 --> 10:04.540]  I'm just gonna be like walking around a room
[10:04.540 --> 10:05.900]  with a ruler looking at it
[10:05.900 --> 10:07.020]  I don't know
[10:07.020 --> 10:09.920]  do I measure the shadow it casts?
[10:10.080 --> 10:10.860]  how do we do this?
[10:11.560 --> 10:13.800]  I can't articulate or even process
[10:14.320 --> 10:16.120]  I wonder how hard it is to buy
[10:16.120 --> 10:17.360]  10 million fireflies
[10:17.360 --> 10:20.340]  like say you're Elon Musk and you've got more money
[10:20.340 --> 10:23.260]  and you just go like I want 10 million fireflies
[10:23.260 --> 10:25.040]  in my front yard next Wednesday
[10:25.040 --> 10:27.040]  and money is no object
[10:27.040 --> 10:28.080]  and they only need to be alive?
[10:28.220 --> 10:29.800]  they have to be alive and firefly
[10:29.800 --> 10:31.640]  let's assume it's the right season
[10:31.640 --> 10:34.720]  but let's assume it's like May
[10:34.720 --> 10:36.500]  in Austin and it's supposed to be Firefly City
[10:36.500 --> 10:38.740]  is there a place on earth he could buy
[10:38.740 --> 10:39.920]  10 million fireflies from?
[10:40.600 --> 10:41.540]  I bet there's not
[10:41.540 --> 10:44.120]  well you can buy like ladybugs
[10:44.120 --> 10:46.280]  you can buy that shit on Amazon
[10:46.280 --> 10:47.520]  but why?
[10:49.080 --> 10:51.000]  I think for gardening purposes
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.400]  yeah they did a thing
[10:52.400 --> 10:54.360]  like years and years and years and years ago
[10:54.360 --> 10:56.820]  when we were signing the creatures to the Let's Play family
[10:57.640 --> 10:59.140]  right before they splintered
[10:59.140 --> 10:59.560]  in half
[11:00.140 --> 11:02.220]  and made things very complicated for us
[11:02.740 --> 11:04.500]  they did a prank where they
[11:05.460 --> 11:06.340]  unleashed like
[11:06.340 --> 11:08.380]  I want to say a thousand ladybugs
[11:08.380 --> 11:10.460]  in their office and they almost got kicked out of the building
[11:10.460 --> 11:11.680]  because there were other tenants
[11:12.620 --> 11:13.320]  oh wow
[11:14.260 --> 11:15.060]  that's a good prank
[11:15.460 --> 11:18.840]  They pinch you too. Have you ever been bit by one? No.
[11:19.620 --> 11:24.220]  No, I haven't. Maybe we should cover Geoff in Ladybirds and see if he gets bit.
[11:24.580 --> 11:27.960]  I don't want to get pinched. We'll just cover Gavin in Ladybugs.
[11:29.900 --> 11:35.200]  I got my balls waxed. It's your turn to do the extra work. Yeah, he's got a good point.
[11:35.640 --> 11:38.980]  Geoff has ratcheted it. I got my anus waxed. I was there. Yeah, same.
[11:39.720 --> 11:41.480]  He's elevated the game, I think.
[11:41.480 --> 11:49.240]  I think it's time for you to... Oh, I'm not doing this. I was gonna ask, do you call Ladybugs Ladybirds?
[11:50.100 --> 11:55.860]  It did sound like you said that. Is that what they're called? Yeah. I didn't know that.
[11:57.340 --> 12:00.540]  I think I learned that from a game. In England? Is that what they're called in England?
[12:01.260 --> 12:04.700]  I guess so. I mean, that's what I call them. Huh. I don't think it's just me.
[12:06.760 --> 12:10.520]  I also don't think it's just you. I agree that that's probably what it's called.
[12:10.520 --> 12:12.900]  I don't think at any point I thought it was just you.
[12:16.760 --> 12:21.120]  Oh, yeah. Commonly known as Ladybugs in North America and Ladybirds in the United Kingdom.
[12:21.320 --> 12:26.500]  I don't know about the rest of the world. It was Americanized in the USA to Ladybug
[12:26.500 --> 12:30.080]  and not Ladybird. Interesting. So why don't you call it Ladybug Lake?
[12:31.380 --> 12:35.880]  Because it's named after a woman named Ladybird Johnson. It was President Johnson's wife.
[12:35.880 --> 12:42.640]  Why wasn't she called Ladybug Johnson? Why are you called Gavin? Should we dig up her parents
[12:42.640 --> 12:46.740]  and grill them on why they named her Ladybird? Yeah, but Gavin is an actual name. That's like
[12:46.740 --> 12:52.280]  saying why aren't you called Flavin? Yeah. Now I will say I got to agree with Gavin on this one.
[12:52.440 --> 12:59.420]  Why is her name not Ladybug Johnson? What's a Ladybird to her? If you don't call it a Ladybird,
[12:59.540 --> 13:05.700]  what is a Ladybird? Yeah. I think that Hank Hill's dog should be named Ladybug.
[13:05.880 --> 13:11.200]  This is great. This is good. They need to rename that movie Ladybug. This is fantastic.
[13:11.480 --> 13:13.960]  You know what? Flavin's right. I agree with him now.
[13:15.960 --> 13:23.120]  We should retroactively change Ladybird Johnson's name to Ladybug Johnson and her family and estate
[13:23.120 --> 13:32.120]  should have no say in the matter. Yeah, but what does that mean for her? Man, I don't know how
[13:32.120 --> 13:37.480]  we're supposed to answer. Yeah, I don't. I'm not sure. Is it just nothing to do with the bug? No.
[13:38.180 --> 13:42.880]  Ladybird was her nickname, actually. Her nickname Ladybird came from Alice Tittle,
[13:43.340 --> 13:48.740]  a nursemaid who remarked that she was as pretty as a Ladybird. Well, that person's surely talking
[13:48.740 --> 13:54.720]  about the bug. Surely. Or is she talking about a female bird? That's also possible. Is there
[13:54.720 --> 14:01.300]  a bird called the Ladybird? All birds, all female birds are called Ladybirds. Ladybird is two words?
[14:03.260 --> 14:08.640]  Did you not see the movie? It's no, no, but I've seen the movie is two words, but I thought Ladybird
[14:08.640 --> 14:13.160]  Johnson, like her name was like her name was like Ladybird. Like it was like one word. I didn't know.
[14:13.680 --> 14:20.440]  That's weirder that it's weirder that her nickname is Ladybird. Where was Alice Tittle from?
[14:20.640 --> 14:28.460]  Yeah, also there was a lady named Tittle. Alice Tittle. And she was a nursemaid. That's a perfect
[14:28.460 --> 14:35.960]  name for a nursemaid. Where does Larry Bird fit into all this? Larry Bird? He's the greatest
[14:35.960 --> 14:40.980]  trash talker in the history of the NBA. That's how he fits in. Was his wife Ladybird? No, here's
[14:40.980 --> 14:47.780]  the thing. Ladybird had a daughter named Linda Bird Johnson. Yes. Now it makes even less sense.
[14:48.040 --> 14:54.140]  Now it's just Linda Bird. Linda Bug. You didn't know about Linda Bird? Her name should be Linda
[14:54.140 --> 15:01.560]  Bug. Actually, I think I have a recording of a Ladybird chirping. Oh, no, no, no.
[15:03.600 --> 15:10.200]  Oh, my God. Either way, it's a beetle. Either way, it's a beetle that you're right about that.
[15:10.260 --> 15:16.780]  It's not even. Yeah. I had an idea the other day I wanted to run by you guys, but I think I think
[15:16.780 --> 15:23.040]  is a product we shouldn't make, but it would be so cool if we did this right. It would be so cool
[15:23.040 --> 15:27.440]  if we made this. I was driving through my neighborhood the other day and I saw one of
[15:27.440 --> 15:33.240]  those dudes walking around like a construction dude. He just had like blue jeans and like some
[15:33.240 --> 15:38.020]  fucking torn shoes on and a white shirt and a high vis vest. And he had one of those sticks
[15:38.020 --> 15:42.820]  that has a spray spray paint can on the bottom of it, you know, and they just walk around ground.
[15:43.180 --> 15:47.740]  Yeah. And they like mark a circle where there's a gas line or like a line where there's I don't
[15:47.740 --> 15:52.840]  know whatever the fuck they're doing, water main or whatever. And I got to thinking if I had that
[15:52.840 --> 16:00.300]  vest on. I could pretty much do anything and no one would look twice at me. Yeah, I could if I had
[16:00.300 --> 16:03.660]  that if I went to that guy and I said, give me I'll give you five hundred dollars, give me your
[16:03.660 --> 16:09.120]  high vis vest and the spray paint gun can thing. I could walk around any neighborhood in Austin
[16:09.120 --> 16:14.200]  drawing dicks wherever I wanted to and no one would even see it. I could do it in front of
[16:14.200 --> 16:18.380]  somebody and they wouldn't be paying attention because I'd be invisible to them because construction
[16:18.380 --> 16:23.260]  goes on all the time in Texas, which just got me thinking, man, uniform could really
[16:23.260 --> 16:28.980]  fill a niche market there if they made high vis vests. I have thought about this a lot,
[16:29.000 --> 16:36.100]  but in a different way of as somebody who enjoys sloppy Joe's bingo and just watching the sloppy
[16:36.100 --> 16:42.060]  Joe cam. But they have the worst mic set up I've ever heard. I've often thought about I bet you
[16:42.060 --> 16:47.800]  if we just throw Nick in one of those vests, he could he could walk up with a ladder and put a new
[16:47.800 --> 16:54.240]  mic in and nobody would ask any fucking guarantee it. He could be like, hey, I'm the guy from the
[16:54.240 --> 16:58.140]  web place. Where do you want me? Where's the box? I need to plug the new mic. I got a new set up.
[16:58.240 --> 17:04.280]  Yeah, it would be a great service to all of us because their mic sucks. It's so bad. The reason
[17:04.280 --> 17:08.960]  I don't think we should do it is one. I don't want to be I don't want to be blamed for all the dicks
[17:08.960 --> 17:13.580]  across the world that people draw dicks across America, dicks across America. I assume it'd be
[17:13.580 --> 17:19.660]  global, you know, people draw dicks everywhere. But it also seems like a really good way to rob a
[17:19.660 --> 17:24.820]  bank or a grocery store or you know what I mean? I don't want to get involved in any kind of high
[17:24.820 --> 17:30.280]  crimes. So I think we should let that one go. But man, it would be cool to have a uniform high-vis
[17:30.280 --> 17:38.740]  vest. What is the longest dick chain? What do you mean? Like if you were to draw a dick, draw a dick
[17:38.740 --> 17:42.460]  and then put another dick next to it, like how how many dicks in a line have there ever been?
[17:45.500 --> 17:50.500]  Oh. Because you could spray that chalk stuff that just kind of like blows away, right? Yeah.
[17:52.080 --> 17:58.160]  I bet it's not very long. What's the longest dick ever drawn? I don't know. Like if you started if
[17:58.160 --> 18:03.260]  you made the balls at at one end of a football field and then made the shaft run all the way
[18:03.260 --> 18:06.940]  to the other end of the football field, draw the head around the goal and then come all the way
[18:06.940 --> 18:13.960]  back and you've got like a football field long dick. Should we contact football stadiums? Or maybe
[18:13.960 --> 18:20.420]  not stadiums. Like high school fields and see if any of them... maybe not high school. College.
[18:21.440 --> 18:27.760]  Yeah. Let's go back to pro. Let's go back to pro. And see if we can just do it like a temp spray
[18:28.940 --> 18:35.100]  penis that could be seen from the sky with a drone. And if they say no, we just show up in
[18:35.600 --> 18:42.060]  vests. We walk right on and do it anyway. No one will look twice. There was a pause of terror when
[18:42.060 --> 18:46.600]  you said football, Gavin, that felt like you didn't know what to say next, which made me really laugh.
[18:46.860 --> 18:50.800]  I thought you were just going to end it at we should call football because you don't know
[18:51.240 --> 18:56.060]  where else to go. You just know they got the fields. Get Mr. Football on the line.
[18:57.320 --> 19:04.160]  Oh man. I think a uniform high-vis would be fine to sell. We just obviously don't promote crime,
[19:04.160 --> 19:12.160]  but I think I feel like be cool. No, don't use it for crime for sure. Or a uniform like DHL brown
[19:12.160 --> 19:18.540]  shorts and button up. Like that will also get you into places. I think the move is, like I said,
[19:18.580 --> 19:24.500]  we make one prototype. We give it to Nick. We watch the sloppy Joe's cam. And if he's able to
[19:24.500 --> 19:30.800]  replace the mic without being detected, then it's a viable product. Just a series where we just
[19:30.800 --> 19:36.900]  there's just called How Invisible Is Nick? And we just see what Nick can do in high-vis. He is
[19:36.900 --> 19:42.840]  such a regulation guy. He is the first regulation guy. And I mean this in the best possible sense,
[19:42.940 --> 19:47.320]  Nick, but you're already invisible. We put a high-vis vest on you. You just like disappear
[19:47.320 --> 19:52.380]  in front of our eyes. That's a brilliant idea. Like I feel like Geoff and Eric and maybe me
[19:52.380 --> 19:57.640]  sometimes we're a little bit eye catching for just various features of our faces and body.
[19:58.400 --> 20:05.820]  Tattoos or big noses or whatever, yeah. Yeah, this is great. What can we get Nick up to?
[20:06.560 --> 20:13.860]  Could we get Nick onto the roof of one of the skyscrapers downtown?
[20:15.320 --> 20:20.500]  I don't think he wants that. Nick, how scared of heights are you? You don't have to be near the
[20:20.500 --> 20:25.560]  edge. I'm not, but that's pretty high. No, just like through the stairs. You're not like scaling
[20:25.560 --> 20:35.380]  the side. I mean, that still sucks. That's a lot of stairs, Gavin. We should see if we can get Nick
[20:35.380 --> 20:42.720]  to wheel stuff into busy businesses. Yeah. Like on a dolly in the high-vis vest and just be like,
[20:42.820 --> 20:45.920]  where's the break room? And the guy's like, oh, it's over to the left. You just leave and just
[20:45.920 --> 20:51.180]  like drop it and then leave. And it's just like an empty cardboard box or a bunch of old magazines.
[20:52.220 --> 20:57.440]  Could we get Nick to the thermostat of the Frostbank Tower? Do you think there's a thermostat?
[21:01.740 --> 21:06.800]  The basement thermostat. Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you on those big buildings like that,
[21:06.840 --> 21:11.020]  because I did a tour of one a couple of years ago, they have like weird sub floors that are just for
[21:11.020 --> 21:15.700]  that kind of stuff that are like, it's almost like being John Malkovich, like half floors that
[21:15.700 --> 21:19.540]  they go through. You'd have to get involved in one of those, which would be really fun to explore.
[21:20.280 --> 21:25.320]  I feel like Nick's not necessarily excited about this idea. He may not be up for it,
[21:25.360 --> 21:29.620]  but he's not down for it. He seemed to like the mic idea. Yeah. He seemed enthused about that
[21:29.620 --> 21:34.260]  because that seasoned audio guy would actually be doing a service. That seems less likely as
[21:34.260 --> 21:42.140]  a terroristic threat than wheeling in an empty box to a busy store. What if inside the box was
[21:42.140 --> 21:48.480]  a note that's handwritten that says this is not in any way a threat? I feel like that's even more
[21:48.480 --> 21:55.340]  threatening somehow. That's like pulling out a gun with toy gun written on the side. What if it
[21:55.340 --> 22:01.120]  was a box with 10 million fireflies in it? And then at the bottom of that was the note. That's
[22:01.120 --> 22:06.640]  great. That's great. What if it was the box that Elon Musk really wanted? Oh, now that'd wheel
[22:06.640 --> 22:10.780]  around. That, there you go. What if it's 10 million fireflies, you just put a note on it that
[22:10.780 --> 22:17.960]  says free to a good home. You just got to poke holes in the box. Looking forward to you fixing
[22:17.960 --> 22:24.380]  the audio at Sloppy Joe's then, Nick. Hey, thanks, man. So am I. I can't wait. Me too. Hey, so we've
[22:24.380 --> 22:29.480]  been filming a lot of shit, a lot of supplemental stuff lately, a lot of ancillary content lately.
[22:29.580 --> 22:34.060]  Like I know I was saying earlier, you guys I think just filmed Payday 3 today. And did you
[22:34.060 --> 22:38.960]  guys play anything else or just that one? Just that. Okay, and then I know you guys also, we did
[22:38.960 --> 22:45.320]  the, recently did the Break Show where I opened up the Andrew's Nugget Buddies and you filmed a
[22:45.320 --> 22:51.680]  special commentary on that. We just had like a Kitchen Day Friday where I, it's all been filmed,
[22:51.820 --> 22:55.660]  but it obviously hasn't come out yet. So I don't think we can talk about like who won what contest
[22:55.660 --> 22:59.960]  or anything. I want to try to get a read though, because I have a feeling you guys did the crouton
[22:59.960 --> 23:08.500]  off. Yes, crouton. The crouton, yes. Yeah. You and Gracie. I, I think Gracie won and I don't want
[23:08.500 --> 23:15.200]  spoilers. What makes you think that though? I think I was saying to Eric that Geoff has had a lot of
[23:15.200 --> 23:21.620]  teeth issues and croutons are very crunchy things. And I think that there would be a level of fear,
[23:21.800 --> 23:28.420]  which would be completely earned in Geoff to chomp at the rate in which Gracie, who to my knowledge
[23:28.420 --> 23:34.340]  hasn't had the same tooth issue history. I think it would make, it would add confidence and more risk
[23:34.340 --> 23:40.100]  in the chew game. I'll, I'll tell you that if she didn't before, she will after what we just went
[23:40.100 --> 23:45.880]  through. She probably, I think we both probably took five years off our teeth's life. Oh no. Yeah.
[23:47.820 --> 23:56.940]  Oh, I'm so excited to see that. Yeah. I also feel like Gracie had a, has a blemish, uh, from, uh,
[23:56.940 --> 24:03.860]  maybe other things that, uh, that I think, I think there may have been like an additional competitive,
[24:04.480 --> 24:10.000]  I need to, I need to take a win somewhere. Yeah. That's another piece of supplemental content
[24:10.000 --> 24:14.140]  we've been filming behind the scenes. And that is not at all a spoiler to the results of that
[24:14.140 --> 24:20.860]  thing. That is in reference to a, just a insane confession that I cannot wait for people to see
[24:20.860 --> 24:27.140]  because it has changed my perception of Gracie in the best way, but in a way that I never anticipated.
[24:27.400 --> 24:32.480]  And I don't think, and maybe you do have an awareness. You have to let us know, Gracie,
[24:32.580 --> 24:39.240]  that is going to follow you in a way that I don't know if you realize it will. It is, that's, that's,
[24:39.240 --> 24:44.540]  that's part of you now, whatever that comes out. Gracie, you planted a flag in that moment.
[24:46.080 --> 24:48.280]  Yeah, I do regret sharing.
[24:53.440 --> 24:59.180]  So my, that's sort of my belief is Gracie, I think to some degree is aware that that flag
[24:59.180 --> 25:05.580]  was planted and wanted to plant a new flag as quickly as possible, which would be the
[25:06.280 --> 25:07.180]  flags over here.
[25:10.340 --> 25:16.220]  Well, I'll say this, it was, it was a hell of a competition. And I think, well, I think it'll
[25:16.220 --> 25:20.100]  be interesting to see the results. One contestant definitely played more clean than the other.
[25:21.360 --> 25:25.600]  Yeah, I'll say that. There's a lot of ways to interpret that. That's one played more clean
[25:25.600 --> 25:30.700]  than the other. I will say, well, I don't even want to say if it was a blowout or not. I don't
[25:30.700 --> 25:36.060]  really want to give any kind of, it was a, it was a competition for sure. And two people came,
[25:36.760 --> 25:40.860]  they came and they competed. I'm excited. That sounded weird.
[25:42.800 --> 25:50.200]  You're right. They showed up and competed. And then, and then we did another competition where
[25:50.200 --> 25:55.500]  we made regulation sandwiches with our eyes closed. And then were rated on the presentation
[25:55.500 --> 25:59.700]  and taste, which was pretty fun. Goddamn, Nick, you okay?
[26:02.960 --> 26:09.220]  I'm laughing at that. The idea was to do this in a pitch black room, but we went low budget and
[26:09.220 --> 26:13.140]  everyone just closed your eyes. Nah, we wore blindfolds. Oh, that's good.
[26:13.700 --> 26:17.100]  Originally I wanted to do it with all the light software and thermal cameras, but
[26:17.100 --> 26:22.680]  it's, it's where sleeping masks also work. Well, we did it at one in the afternoon. It's where we
[26:22.680 --> 26:26.000]  came up with the idea for a sleeping mask. Have we talked to you about this, Andrew? We have an
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.400]  amazing idea for a new product. No, I want to hear it. It's a sleeping mask. When are you...
[26:30.400 --> 26:32.220]  It's a hi-vis sleeping mask. When are you, now, but kind of,
[26:32.400 --> 26:37.280]  when are you at your most vulnerable in life? Oh, when a sleeping mask on is definitely up there.
[26:37.460 --> 26:42.900]  When you're asleep, right? When you, that's when your guard is as down as it's gonna be. So,
[26:44.360 --> 26:49.820]  you can't protect yourself. However, what if you were wearing a sleeping mask that had Andrew,
[26:49.820 --> 26:52.940]  you, it had your open eyes. This doesn't work for you. It works for everybody else on earth, but you.
[26:53.220 --> 26:58.340]  It had, Andrew, it has your open eyes, like from the sunshade, right? So, when somebody goes down,
[26:58.420 --> 27:03.140]  like, say somebody, say I am a, say I'm like a BTK kind of guy, and I come in and I'm gonna,
[27:03.140 --> 27:07.500]  I'm gonna murder you real good. I'm gonna stab you and kill you and chop you up and,
[27:07.860 --> 27:11.160]  you know, it's gonna be brutal. There's gonna be blood everywhere. And I'm coming in the house
[27:11.160 --> 27:15.400]  just to, just to give it to you real good. And I go to put my arms around your neck when you're
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.320]  sleeping in bed, but it's dark. And when I lean over, your eyes are open and you're looking at
[27:19.320 --> 27:24.700]  me. It gives me pause. I freak out for a second. I either run away scared. Maybe I bang something,
[27:24.780 --> 27:30.320]  which gives you a moment to wake up and alert yourself, right? And then you can defend yourself,
[27:30.400 --> 27:35.460]  hopefully. Also, why not, since we're already making a sleep mask with somebody else's eyes on
[27:35.460 --> 27:41.180]  it, why not have it extend down a little bit and put a big mustache, a sleep mustache as well? So
[27:41.180 --> 27:45.520]  the other option is somebody comes in to kill you and they have a picture of you because they've
[27:45.520 --> 27:49.060]  been hired by, you know, somebody in high school that didn't like you or whatever that wants to
[27:49.060 --> 27:52.620]  rub you out. And they look at you and then they look at the person in the in the sleep mask with
[27:52.620 --> 27:55.860]  the mustache and they go, well, this is not the same person at all. Different eyes, different
[27:55.860 --> 28:00.960]  mustache. And then they just leave. Your life has been spared. That's interesting. You're thinking
[28:00.960 --> 28:04.900]  about it from a security perspective. I am. It made me think of, I don't know if you've ever seen
[28:04.900 --> 28:11.360]  the movie Strange Wilderness, but Justin Long plays a character who tattoos his eyelids to be
[28:11.360 --> 28:17.160]  open eyes so he can just sleep in public without people knowing. Yeah. And that's, that's one of
[28:17.160 --> 28:20.680]  I think it could be beyond security. It could just be a convenience thing of if you're in a meeting
[28:20.680 --> 28:25.640]  and you don't want people to know your eyes are closed, you just close, you get that set up.
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.500]  Like a really low profile sleep mask. Yes. You can't tell is a sleep mask. So it's like flesh
[28:31.500 --> 28:35.180]  colored or hair colored all the way around. If someone from high school wants to kill you,
[28:35.220 --> 28:38.120]  but you are homeschooled, does that mean your parents want to kill you? Probably.
[28:39.540 --> 28:42.500]  You should probably look into that, Andrew. Yeah, I guess.
[28:42.500 --> 28:49.800]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[28:50.480 --> 28:56.340]  Relationships with people in your life are extremely complex, whether it's family or
[28:56.340 --> 29:06.260]  friends or something in the romantic realm. It is a difficult thing that is at times wonderful
[29:06.260 --> 29:11.600]  and other times extremely challenging. But that doesn't mean it's not worth it. And I have found
[29:11.600 --> 29:17.700]  in some of the relationships I've had in my personal life that it took a lot of time and
[29:17.700 --> 29:24.160]  effort to sort of process certain feelings and work through a point in which those relationships
[29:24.160 --> 29:29.520]  could be in a healthy place. And sometimes people you're close to, it's not always the
[29:29.520 --> 29:33.500]  healthiest of dynamics, but that doesn't mean it's impossible for them to get to that place.
[29:33.580 --> 29:39.000]  It just takes a lot of work. A common misconception about relationships is that they have to be easy
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.200]  to be right. But sometimes the best ones happen when both people put in the work to make them
[29:43.200 --> 29:48.680]  great. It's also a complex thing because both people need to be willing to acknowledge that
[29:48.680 --> 29:52.700]  there is an issue. It can be really tough if sometimes you want to work on yourself,
[29:52.840 --> 29:57.220]  but the other person isn't necessarily interested. It's just there's a whole bunch of layers that
[29:57.220 --> 30:01.000]  even in that scenario, therapy is a great option to sort through that.
[30:01.520 --> 30:04.680]  Therapy can be a great place to work through the challenges you face in all of your relationships,
[30:04.680 --> 30:09.780]  whether friends, work, or significant other, or anyone. Therapy is something that has helped me
[30:09.780 --> 30:14.180]  in countless ways, as I say every time when I talk about this, especially in this field,
[30:14.560 --> 30:19.180]  but it has helped in almost every aspect of my life, and I just think it's a really important
[30:19.180 --> 30:23.520]  process to go through. So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.

[33:27.600 --> 33:32.900]  Well, you know what? This has been a tough enough year. I watched a thing. This is this is a big
[33:32.900 --> 33:38.560]  pivot. We're going on a different story here. I have a grade one. I hurt my hamstring. Grade one
[33:38.560 --> 33:43.880]  injury. I still don't know how this happened. Yeah, I teased it. Do you have any predictions
[33:43.880 --> 33:49.220]  as to how I injured my hamstring? I have a prediction. What's your prediction, Gavin?
[33:49.600 --> 33:55.540]  I think you slipped on a gob of lotion. I think you stood up.
[33:58.000 --> 34:04.040]  I tweeted about this and I asked people to guess. Nobody got it exactly right. There were a lot of
[34:04.040 --> 34:08.820]  like getting out of the bathtub guesses or just getting getting up in general.
[34:10.200 --> 34:17.180]  Uh, I this is this is reminiscent. This is almost a throwback. Remember when I slipped on the on the
[34:17.180 --> 34:25.880]  sushi container? No. And I didn't do that. But in an effort to almost prevent that, you know, new
[34:25.880 --> 34:31.420]  year trying to trying to take better care of myself, make sure I'm on top of things. I decided
[34:31.420 --> 34:37.380]  that I'm like redesigning my room and doing a full clean. It's going to be great. And so I've been in
[34:37.380 --> 34:42.440]  the process of that and everything is clean. This is the nicest it's looked in a bit. Not that it was
[34:42.440 --> 34:46.240]  bad before, but you know, when you when you do like a deep clean and it's like, oh, this is great. This
[34:46.240 --> 34:52.820]  is fantastic. So you rearranged as well. I rearranged. I'm resetting up new bed, all that stuff. Oh, we
[34:52.820 --> 34:58.280]  can draw your room again. Yeah, you could do a redesign of that if you want. But I was all happy
[34:58.280 --> 35:03.680]  and it was a Friday night last Friday. And I'm like, this is having a great time. I'm going to get up
[35:03.680 --> 35:09.360]  and get a little glass of water. I'm looking at my phone. Next thing I know, I am sliding. I'm
[35:09.360 --> 35:16.940]  sliding across my floor. I got my phone in my hand. What I did was I put my foot in one of those
[35:16.940 --> 35:26.380]  Swiffer wet jet boxes and it just went. I did a full. Yeah, it's you know, like the pads you can
[35:26.380 --> 35:31.320]  strap onto the bottom of Swiffer. I put my foot landed right in the middle of one of those that
[35:31.320 --> 35:37.520]  was next to my bed that I didn't remember was there. And it fit perfectly like a shoe. And I
[35:37.520 --> 35:45.660]  could not stop the momentum. And my hand, I had a thing in my hand and I did. I did the full splits
[35:45.660 --> 35:52.620]  and then landed on my face trying to push the mic stand away like that. But a plastic one is what
[35:52.620 --> 35:56.560]  Geoff is. I know. I know what you're talking about. I know. I know the. Yeah. Yeah. It's the plastic
[35:56.560 --> 36:03.500]  one. My foot smelt great, first of all. Great aroma. It smelled very clean in the area. But I
[36:03.500 --> 36:11.720]  felt like my knee pop. And then it was it was like my entire hamstring tightened up. And it was it
[36:11.720 --> 36:16.660]  was a moment of appreciating that I watch football because I can explain it as a grade one hamstring
[36:16.660 --> 36:23.120]  injury and not as a Swiffer wet jet slide. It sounds a lot more official that what grace.
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.240]  That is what I put my foot in. I have to. My phone wasn't such a piece of shit. I take a
[36:28.240 --> 36:34.160]  photo of the box. It is destroyed. The plastic container saved the container. I saved it
[36:34.160 --> 36:39.240]  because I want to take a photo of my phone sucks. I haven't taken a photo of it, but I have it still
[36:39.240 --> 36:44.160]  because I wanted to show you guys how much I wrecked it. Are you just saving it till you buy
[36:44.160 --> 36:49.180]  a new phone? Well, I might have another phone in the work. I tried to buy a phone last night as
[36:49.180 --> 36:55.100]  a bit, but maybe I'll have another one in a different way anyway. OK, that was terrible.
[36:55.640 --> 37:01.640]  And the first things I thought of, maybe, Geoff, you're aware of this. Tyrese Halberton on the
[37:01.640 --> 37:08.400]  Pacers recently had a split century against the Celtics. Yeah, I believe that was the Celtics,
[37:08.460 --> 37:12.860]  right? Yeah, it was. It was. Yeah. And I laughed at him for that because it looked like a guy
[37:12.860 --> 37:18.240]  trying to do like the James Brown splits and it not working. And I did essentially the same thing.
[37:18.240 --> 37:23.600]  And then the second thing I thought about, which is really even more ridiculous, I was scrolling
[37:23.600 --> 37:29.840]  TikTok in December and I came across, you know, this is random things pop up, this ridiculous,
[37:30.200 --> 37:37.220]  insane crypto guy that is also into astrology. And he like makes financial predictions based
[37:37.220 --> 37:44.840]  off of like the zodiac signs and all that thing. And his whole whole video was about how it's going
[37:44.840 --> 37:52.240]  to be a dragon year next year. And that if you are a year of the dog, you got to watch out. You
[37:52.240 --> 37:58.880]  got to be on your toes because the dragon is your rival, apparently. And I'm getting to that.
[37:59.640 --> 38:05.120]  The dragon is the rival. And if you try to do anything as a dog this year, you got to be
[38:05.120 --> 38:10.280]  careful. Your day is going to get fucked up. So I realized that in the month of January,
[38:10.280 --> 38:16.280]  I got attacked by medication I was taking. I now have fucked up my hamstring and knee
[38:16.960 --> 38:22.760]  that's still really sore. I'm recovering, but it was painful. And I just thought of that guy,
[38:22.820 --> 38:28.900]  and now I'm haunted by dragons. So this year I'm banning all dragons. No Imagine Dragons.
[38:29.320 --> 38:32.900]  If How to Train Your Dragon came on like as a trailer for a movie, I'm walking out.
[38:33.060 --> 38:35.620]  I'm avoiding dragons. They're doing a live action remake of it too.
[38:35.920 --> 38:38.860]  They are, hopefully. I'm not seeing it. I don't want to know anything about it.
[38:38.860 --> 38:44.140]  I'm keeping away. I've decided to outlaw dragons, but then I learned that that son
[38:44.140 --> 38:49.360]  of a bitch down there, that Gavin Free, is a dragon. What's up? He's a dragon boy.
[38:49.720 --> 38:52.540]  So are you a dog then? I'm a dog, yeah.
[38:53.140 --> 38:55.900]  And you're, Gavin, you're a dragon? Yeah, I think I'm an earth dragon.
[38:56.520 --> 38:59.420]  Eric, what are you? Fire tiger.
[38:59.960 --> 39:03.460]  Did you say fire tiger? Fire tiger.
[39:03.580 --> 39:07.380]  Holy shit. What about Nick and Gracie? How the hell do you... just Google it, Chinese
[39:07.960 --> 39:11.620]  new year animal for the year you were born. Yeah, it's the year you're born.
[39:11.780 --> 39:15.060]  There's an element and an animal. Do you remember what yours is, Geoff?
[39:15.280 --> 39:17.700]  I just know I'm a rabbit. I don't know what the element is.
[39:18.420 --> 39:21.960]  How do I find my element? Were you a wood rabbit and we made fun of you?
[39:23.620 --> 39:29.000]  I just said what was the... okay, here we go. 1975 Chinese zodiac element.
[39:29.560 --> 39:31.680]  Wood. God damn it. I'm a wooden rabbit.
[39:31.680 --> 39:35.380]  And Nick's a fire rabbit. Wow.
[39:36.880 --> 39:40.700]  Oh, Gracie's a metal snake. That's fucking awesome.
[39:41.080 --> 39:44.340]  What year is metal snake? 2001.
[39:45.820 --> 39:49.600]  Jesus Christ. I feel like there are some cats older than Gracie.
[39:51.820 --> 39:55.060]  That's so fucking hardcore. Yeah, it is.
[39:55.460 --> 39:59.060]  I mean, think about it. That's going to be Shmi. Shmi is going to outlive so many people
[39:59.060 --> 40:03.860]  just keep going once he gets a shot. You should start a band, Gracie.
[40:05.020 --> 40:07.400]  Can y'all refer to me as that from now on?
[40:09.920 --> 40:13.280]  That's cool. You know on Slack you can put a nickname, right?
[40:14.100 --> 40:16.500]  I don't think the company needs to see that.
[40:16.780 --> 40:20.960]  What was that? You should be fucking proud to be a metal snake.
[40:22.200 --> 40:25.160]  We thought might be a fun trucker name for you the other day, Andrew,
[40:25.320 --> 40:27.780]  we were talking. Do you remember? Oh, fuck. No, I don't remember.
[40:27.780 --> 40:30.800]  It's salmon, right? It was something salmon. Oh, it's like big salmon.
[40:30.920 --> 40:33.240]  Was that big salmon or something? Oh, that's pretty cool.
[40:33.440 --> 40:36.380]  I like that big salmon. Big salmon's not a bad name.
[40:36.680 --> 40:39.920]  No, it's not. Not the worst for sure. Why big metal snake?
[40:40.240 --> 40:44.680]  Because we were talking about the game and Andrew was saying he was really
[40:44.680 --> 40:49.900]  the night he joined with the truckers and I, he was really intimidated by the map we were on.
[40:49.960 --> 40:52.860]  And I was telling him that the next side of that map, because, you know,
[40:52.860 --> 40:55.520]  there's like multiple maps in the world sometimes between two and four.
[40:55.520 --> 40:59.720]  Uh, the next one over is a map called Big Salmon Peak.
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.480]  And I was like, it's the best, it's the best map in the game.
[41:03.540 --> 41:06.940]  Like, it's just fun and it's not terribly hard and it's just a,
[41:07.260 --> 41:09.660]  it's just pretty and it's just great.
[41:10.060 --> 41:13.000]  And we were, he was saying Big Salmon would be a good name for a trucker.
[41:13.020 --> 41:15.500]  It would. Because we've got Free Bird for Gavin,
[41:15.620 --> 41:18.220]  Big Salmon now for Andrew. I'm G-Bone.
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.640]  And then Metal Snake apparently for Gracie. Muddy Buddy for Nick.
[41:22.640 --> 41:24.660]  It has just been a chain though.
[41:24.840 --> 41:28.220]  We're not even out of January. I also didn't get Darla.
[41:28.520 --> 41:31.000]  I'm missing a Nugget Buddy. That was a big miss.
[41:31.460 --> 41:33.440]  Yeah, how was that? How did you feel about that?
[41:33.560 --> 41:35.240]  Did you think you'd get it? Were you surprised?
[41:35.800 --> 41:38.460]  Well, I sent you like 20 of them. It was a lot.
[41:38.640 --> 41:41.320]  I expected Darla to be there. That was devastating.
[41:41.960 --> 41:44.580]  I also, to add to the list of things gone wrong,
[41:44.940 --> 41:49.420]  there's a product I like and they did a fun thing where they were selling mystery boxes.
[41:49.420 --> 41:52.740]  And they have a bunch of different flavors of the product.
[41:52.880 --> 41:57.180]  And I thought, oh, that's fun. It was like spend $20 on a mystery box,
[41:57.260 --> 42:00.540]  get $50 worth of the product. So I bought five.
[42:00.720 --> 42:04.540]  Because I was like, this will just be a fun, like a blind box type of thing.
[42:04.740 --> 42:06.820]  This is going to be great. And I waited for it.
[42:07.220 --> 42:10.020]  And I finally got them. And I opened them.
[42:10.500 --> 42:14.680]  And I was like, okay, so you get like four packages of different sizes.
[42:14.920 --> 42:18.880]  And then a big package at the end. I didn't really like the biggest package for it.
[42:18.880 --> 42:21.120]  But I thought, that's fine. I got four other ones to go through.
[42:21.580 --> 42:25.620]  Next box, completely identical to the first box.
[42:26.100 --> 42:29.720]  Third box, same as the first. All of the mysteries were the same.
[42:29.940 --> 42:32.520]  It's a mystery box, but it's just one mystery.
[42:32.920 --> 42:35.700]  Yeah, it's because they don't collate at the shipping warehouse.
[42:36.040 --> 42:36.320]  So it's...
[42:38.340 --> 42:40.720]  Unfortunately, what would have probably been a smarter decision,
[42:41.200 --> 42:43.700]  other than fucking shipping, is to buy like one a day.
[42:44.140 --> 42:46.520]  Oh, no, no, no. It didn't matter. I reached out about it.
[42:46.520 --> 42:50.080]  I was curious. And it's just every box was the same mystery.
[42:50.380 --> 42:50.960]  Oh, that's stupid.
[42:50.960 --> 42:53.940]  You just didn't know what was in the mystery box.
[42:55.180 --> 42:55.620]  Oh, I see.
[42:55.620 --> 42:59.220]  So that was... I blame that once again. Dragons. It's a dragon fault.
[42:59.740 --> 43:02.140]  Can I bring something up?
[43:02.500 --> 43:03.020]  Of course.
[43:03.380 --> 43:06.360]  I feel bad that you are having a tough time.
[43:06.700 --> 43:09.300]  And especially with your mystery boxes and everything.
[43:09.600 --> 43:11.640]  But you did receive a package today, right?
[43:11.640 --> 43:12.140]  I did.
[43:13.200 --> 43:14.400]  I got a package from Derek.
[43:14.420 --> 43:16.120]  Do you want to get into that? You want to open that up?
[43:16.120 --> 43:17.140]  Let's open this.
[43:17.280 --> 43:21.320]  And while you're opening that up, let me tell you, Andrew, I have an extra Darla.
[43:21.480 --> 43:22.720]  It's one of the ones I got two of.
[43:23.100 --> 43:23.620]  And I've been holding on.
[43:23.620 --> 43:24.400]  Oh, I really appreciate it.
[43:24.500 --> 43:25.840]  I wanted to see if you got it first.
[43:25.940 --> 43:28.040]  But if you want my Darla, my extra Darla, I'll have...
[43:28.760 --> 43:30.720]  I'll throw it in the box when we ship your shit back to you.
[43:30.800 --> 43:31.920]  And that way you'll have your complete collection.
[43:32.240 --> 43:33.800]  I really... that's very kind of you.
[43:33.920 --> 43:35.920]  I'm mad that I didn't essentially pull it.
[43:36.020 --> 43:36.560]  Like, you know what I mean?
[43:36.560 --> 43:37.960]  Like, it's a different experience.
[43:38.200 --> 43:39.220]  But it's... I appreciate it.
[43:39.220 --> 43:41.220]  I need to throw something in that box, by the way.
[43:41.240 --> 43:41.420]  Cool.
[43:41.540 --> 43:42.760]  I'm opening this box.
[43:43.980 --> 43:45.060]  Did I get a box, Eric?
[43:46.120 --> 43:46.440]  No.
[43:46.740 --> 43:49.120]  I would have just handed it to you.
[43:49.520 --> 43:50.440]  Oh, you don't...
[43:50.440 --> 43:51.400]  Oh, shit.
[43:51.660 --> 43:53.760]  It's got that styrofoam stuff in it.
[43:53.860 --> 43:54.100]  And I fucking...
[43:54.100 --> 43:54.920]  Oh, no. I'm sorry.
[43:55.920 --> 43:56.840]  Exacto-knifed it.
[43:57.040 --> 43:57.740]  It's everywhere.
[43:58.720 --> 43:58.980]  Okay.
[44:00.460 --> 44:01.320]  Oh, what do we got?
[44:03.180 --> 44:04.020]  This is...
[44:04.020 --> 44:05.480]  Whatever this is, it's securely...
[44:06.400 --> 44:07.580]  I hope it's ice cream again.
[44:07.980 --> 44:09.940]  Well, we had to ship it internationally, you know what I mean?
[44:10.700 --> 44:11.700]  Oh, so it cost $60?
[44:14.400 --> 44:14.820]  Roughly.
[44:15.240 --> 44:15.660]  Yeah.
[44:16.440 --> 44:17.400]  Fucking sucks.
[44:17.540 --> 44:17.980]  Yeah.
[44:19.640 --> 44:20.120]  Oh!
[44:20.660 --> 44:22.120]  Oh, what the fuck?!
[44:24.660 --> 44:25.480]  What'd you get?
[44:25.840 --> 44:26.300]  I...
[44:26.300 --> 44:27.200]  I got a...
[44:27.200 --> 44:28.400]  I got a cock!
[44:28.600 --> 44:29.920]  I got a cock award!
[44:30.580 --> 44:31.060]  What?!
[44:31.060 --> 44:31.580]  What?!
[44:31.580 --> 44:33.120]  I got a cock award!
[44:33.740 --> 44:34.220]  What?!
[44:34.220 --> 44:35.120]  I don't...
[44:35.120 --> 44:36.480]  Can we have a...
[44:36.480 --> 44:38.500]  Well, you can't take a photo because your phone is in the passport.
[44:38.520 --> 44:39.080]  Yeah, it's...
[44:39.720 --> 44:40.440]  You got the cock?
[44:40.460 --> 44:40.800]  Tell us...
[44:40.800 --> 44:41.500]  Describe it.
[44:41.560 --> 44:41.880]  I got...
[44:42.840 --> 44:44.740]  Let me air compress all the stuff off it.
[44:44.760 --> 44:45.220]  One sec.
[44:45.660 --> 44:46.180]  Fuck it.
[44:46.900 --> 44:47.280]  Things.
[44:48.560 --> 44:48.960]  Okay.
[44:49.340 --> 44:49.920]  I got a cock!
[44:50.020 --> 44:51.460]  Oh my god, this is nice!
[44:51.620 --> 44:53.240]  Take a potato picture of it.
[44:53.280 --> 44:53.480]  Yeah.
[44:53.920 --> 44:55.800]  I have photos once he sort of...
[44:55.800 --> 44:57.160]  Once he kind of talks you through it.
[44:57.180 --> 44:58.040]  Okay, okay, great.
[44:58.340 --> 44:58.860]  It's a...
[44:58.860 --> 44:59.480]  It's a beak.
[44:59.640 --> 45:01.620]  It seems to be the other beaks.
[45:01.800 --> 45:02.260]  It's a...
[45:02.260 --> 45:06.160]  For a category, as someone who voted multiple times, I didn't...
[45:06.160 --> 45:08.000]  I didn't see this category on the ballot.
[45:08.680 --> 45:10.560]  It was an unrelenting spirit?
[45:11.080 --> 45:12.140]  It was a secret ballot.
[45:12.700 --> 45:13.760]  It was a secret ballot.
[45:13.760 --> 45:15.800]  You know what the funniest thing about the ballot?
[45:15.920 --> 45:17.060]  Is my votes didn't count.
[45:17.220 --> 45:19.320]  I got to see the votes and what people...
[45:19.320 --> 45:20.880]  Mine did not make the cut for myself.
[45:21.460 --> 45:22.240]  But this...
[45:23.300 --> 45:24.220]  This is...
[45:24.220 --> 45:25.240]  I have...
[45:25.240 --> 45:29.120]  I've won the prestigious longest back award.
[45:29.340 --> 45:31.440]  Which I think has to be true.
[45:33.640 --> 45:34.160]  Wow!
[45:37.440 --> 45:39.100]  That's so nice!
[45:39.620 --> 45:39.720]  Dude!
[45:39.720 --> 45:41.640]  Grace is right, that is a stunning cock.
[45:42.280 --> 45:43.920]  That's a 101 right there.
[45:44.340 --> 45:45.880]  A 2023 longest back.
[45:46.220 --> 45:46.960]  Let me take a photo.
[45:47.540 --> 45:48.740]  I mean, longest back.
[45:48.800 --> 45:50.620]  I feel like you're going to take this home every year.
[45:50.900 --> 45:52.740]  There's no one else that can win that.
[45:53.200 --> 45:54.440]  It was...
[45:55.020 --> 45:59.980]  As far as our voting went, it was a runaway victory for Andrew,
[46:00.240 --> 46:03.740]  who deserved the beak award for 2023 for longest back.
[46:03.880 --> 46:05.140]  So congratulations, Andrew.
[46:05.420 --> 46:07.140]  Oh, thank you so much, Eric.
[46:07.600 --> 46:08.700]  Yeah, we wanted to...
[46:08.700 --> 46:09.200]  Oh my god.
[46:09.200 --> 46:13.320]  get you something nice to let you know that you mean a lot to us,
[46:13.420 --> 46:15.720]  and your back is continually the longest.
[46:16.580 --> 46:16.660]  Speech!
[46:17.060 --> 46:17.540]  Speech!
[46:18.440 --> 46:18.920]  Speech!
[46:19.520 --> 46:19.600]  Speech!
[46:21.820 --> 46:27.840]  Well, I guess I would like to first thank the company as a whole for not honoring me
[46:27.840 --> 46:28.980]  to begin with.
[46:29.220 --> 46:31.000]  So I could receive this.
[46:31.460 --> 46:34.260]  Because if I would have won one there, then I couldn't of won one here.
[46:35.180 --> 46:45.380]  I would like to thank the inventor of the Grown Tube. Not for any specific reason, I just appreciate their work.
[46:45.580 --> 46:52.420]  I'd like to thank TPG for writing a series of scripts that are well done.
[46:53.240 --> 47:01.040]  And I would like to thank the Academy that voted for this? Who did vote on this?
[47:01.880 --> 47:03.760]  What was the process of this?
[47:03.760 --> 47:04.980]  Anonymous and secret ballot.
[47:05.320 --> 47:07.820]  Anonymous and secret ballot?
[47:08.340 --> 47:08.480]  Yeah.
[47:09.220 --> 47:09.660]  I see.
[47:10.820 --> 47:13.720]  That's my potato phone photo for you.
[47:13.820 --> 47:14.620]  Oh my god.
[47:15.520 --> 47:18.340]  Did Geoff take that picture?
[47:18.900 --> 47:20.580]  It's a Geoff photo, I guess.
[47:21.960 --> 47:25.540]  We could just reassign all the bad photos to Andrew.
[47:25.540 --> 47:28.880]  Shot on UbiDigi G1 Max.
[47:29.140 --> 47:35.320]  It somehow has motion blur from multiple directions at once. I don't know how you do it.
[47:36.420 --> 47:38.300]  Did you rub Vaseline on the lens?
[47:38.500 --> 47:41.400]  No, there's no motion either. That's just the natural...
[47:42.540 --> 47:44.440]  Thank you so much, guys.
[47:44.740 --> 47:49.480]  Yeah, that was a great acceptance speech. Interesting not to thank your parents for giving you the back.
[47:49.800 --> 47:50.780]  Well, they want to kill him.
[47:51.400 --> 47:52.820]  Oh, I forgot about that.
[47:52.820 --> 47:55.700]  Dude, you better get that eye mask ASAP.
[47:55.800 --> 47:56.740]  I need it.
[47:56.940 --> 48:04.940]  Speaking of TPG, I feel like a few people here got the calendar invite for an event called It All Happens.
[48:05.200 --> 48:07.460]  It All Happens.
[48:07.760 --> 48:09.340]  What is It All Happens?
[48:09.940 --> 48:10.980]  Yeah, I got that too.
[48:11.140 --> 48:12.180]  What the fuck is that?
[48:12.920 --> 48:14.520]  Well, you already said you're going.
[48:15.320 --> 48:19.420]  It says, coming to town and I'm up to something.
[48:25.140 --> 48:27.840]  I'm going to go ahead and accept that calendar invite.
[48:27.940 --> 48:31.880]  Hey, that's pretty bold that Gavin accepts and doesn't just say maybe.
[48:32.180 --> 48:35.400]  Maybe I'm going to switch mine to maybe.
[48:36.200 --> 48:37.540]  Geoff's the maybe guy of the group.
[48:38.320 --> 48:45.840]  I need to talk to TPG because I got TPG on some covert stuff for this show and he can't crack.
[48:46.140 --> 48:47.520]  I need him to keep up his cover.
[48:48.240 --> 48:49.080]  I don't like this.
[48:49.500 --> 48:50.740]  I love it. I can't wait.
[48:52.720 --> 48:54.100]  I got to check in with him.
[48:57.220 --> 48:59.460]  Did milk ever help find a kid?
[49:00.600 --> 49:01.860]  Yeah, I think it did.
[49:02.160 --> 49:03.900]  You said that like you know it to be true.
[49:05.160 --> 49:08.260]  No, I just... what happened to the whole milk?
[49:08.620 --> 49:10.060]  I don't know why you answered, Gavin.
[49:10.860 --> 49:12.400]  Geoff said, I think it did.
[49:12.520 --> 49:14.620]  And I said, you sound like you know it's true.
[49:14.720 --> 49:15.700]  And then Gavin went, no.
[49:17.120 --> 49:18.700]  Yeah, I thought that was odd.
[49:18.860 --> 49:19.560]  I thought that was odd too.
[49:19.560 --> 49:21.920]  I thought you were saying it was a loaded question.
[49:22.580 --> 49:24.820]  I was reading an article about it recently, I remember.
[49:24.980 --> 49:26.840]  I think it... well, I just googled it.
[49:26.880 --> 49:32.620]  It says, milk carton kids campaign proved only marginally successful in helping locate missing children.
[49:32.960 --> 49:35.700]  Well, I would think marginally successful is better than no success.
[49:36.020 --> 49:40.020]  It was eventually abandoned as paper cartons were replaced by...
[49:40.020 --> 49:43.160]  It's like, we stopped trying to find kids because we've switched to plastic.
[49:43.160 --> 49:49.460]  I mean, my milk's still in a wood... not wood, like a cardboard carton.
[49:49.480 --> 49:50.660]  But there's never any kids on it.
[49:51.260 --> 49:54.260]  Yeah, I don't think Canada ever got in on that with the whole milk in a bag thing.
[49:54.440 --> 49:57.980]  That would have been incredibly difficult to get that photo to be useful.
[49:58.380 --> 50:01.020]  Is it known? Is there like a milk kid?
[50:01.420 --> 50:04.360]  Yes, there was a first milk kid.
[50:04.540 --> 50:06.780]  There was an original milk kid.
[50:07.580 --> 50:08.380]  Johnny Gosh.
[50:08.740 --> 50:09.520]  Yes, correct.
[50:09.520 --> 50:13.640]  But can we get back in on milk advertising if this now opens slots?
[50:13.880 --> 50:16.560]  Oh, that's a great idea. Andrew, do you want to start contacting milk?
[50:17.240 --> 50:20.820]  Like, what if instead of the billboard in Deputy, we just went on milk?
[50:20.960 --> 50:21.600]  Just go on milk.
[50:21.600 --> 50:24.700]  I reached out to that pear punk band, haven't heard back, so...
[50:28.520 --> 50:30.840]  Like, fuck your face with milk.
[50:31.380 --> 50:32.980]  Like a slogan kind of thing?
[50:33.080 --> 50:35.120]  I like that. I like that.
[50:36.340 --> 50:39.200]  When I said milk kid, I meant like someone found, by the way.
[50:39.200 --> 50:41.940]  Not like the definitive, like, the first kid.
[50:42.420 --> 50:44.560]  Like, is there a known... just to clarify.
[50:44.700 --> 50:45.720]  Kid that was found? I don't think so.
[50:45.800 --> 50:49.600]  It was credited with raising awareness that missing children were a problem.
[50:50.160 --> 50:53.400]  But I don't know that any kid was actually found because of a milk carton.
[50:53.900 --> 50:54.620]  That's terrible.
[50:54.800 --> 50:59.140]  Because that would be like... that would be like a double victory.
[50:59.760 --> 51:02.980]  Because you both, like, you've saved a kid, and that's obviously amazing.
[51:03.400 --> 51:07.460]  But then you also have, like, the greatest brand ambassador of all time for your milk.
[51:07.860 --> 51:09.020]  It's like a two for one.
[51:09.600 --> 51:13.800]  Oh yeah, sort of a like, milk, it did my body good, and now I'm with my family again.
[51:14.340 --> 51:14.640]  Yeah.
[51:15.080 --> 51:18.600]  I feel like it would have been better to put the kids on the cereal box.
[51:18.940 --> 51:21.580]  Because as a kid I wasn't allowed to leave milk out.
[51:21.920 --> 51:23.980]  I just had to use the milk and put it back in the fridge.
[51:24.220 --> 51:27.740]  I don't think they were hoping kids would be the one that would find the kid.
[51:27.940 --> 51:30.240]  But the cereal was the stuff that stayed on the table.
[51:30.620 --> 51:31.060]  I see.
[51:31.640 --> 51:36.500]  It was in that moment, when staring at my box of Lucky Charms, that I realized...
[51:36.500 --> 51:37.500]  Wait a second.
[51:38.840 --> 51:40.080]  I've seen this leprechaun.
[51:40.260 --> 51:42.200]  I've seen this child.
[51:42.840 --> 51:47.100]  Yeah, I don't... if there is anything that would cause brand loyalty, you would think it would be that.
[51:47.820 --> 51:50.120]  And I haven't thought about those in a long time.
[51:50.520 --> 51:52.160]  I feel like I've never seen one either.
[51:52.340 --> 51:54.240]  That's something I've only seen on TV.
[51:54.840 --> 51:57.260]  Like you've seen reference to it, but you've never experienced it.
[51:57.260 --> 52:00.720]  I think it was done in the... I think it started and finished in the 80s.
[52:00.800 --> 52:03.160]  I don't think it made it to y'all's generations.
[52:03.460 --> 52:05.280]  That makes sense. I feel like it's a Simpsons thing.
[52:05.580 --> 52:05.780]  Yeah.
[52:06.760 --> 52:11.940]  They did away with... they made the switch to plastics in the 80s anyway, because it was cheaper.
[52:12.480 --> 52:14.780]  And more sturdy. And I think that was part of it too.
[52:15.480 --> 52:18.520]  So you think cereal would be the best for advertising?
[52:19.500 --> 52:20.200]  I think so.
[52:21.640 --> 52:25.120]  I think Waffle Maker is also a good angle to explore.
[52:25.120 --> 52:32.140]  What if there was a waffle machine that had some sort of way to change the top structure?
[52:32.760 --> 52:35.720]  And every morning, the news would be on your waffle.
[52:36.240 --> 52:38.380]  Oh, like a smart waffle maker.
[52:38.960 --> 52:39.980]  Yeah, like a different headline.
[52:40.580 --> 52:42.960]  Like news of the day while you're eating your breakfast.
[52:43.180 --> 52:47.300]  Yeah, like if you could just eat your news every morning, I feel like that's...
[52:47.300 --> 52:50.360]  Oh, Eric says he would never read the news, he would simply eat the news.
[52:50.680 --> 52:52.560]  Well, I feel like eat... read and eat.
[52:53.100 --> 53:00.580]  Imagine you're Ethan Hunt, and your next mission comes in, and you have to scan it and then eat it, so nobody can read it.
[53:00.640 --> 53:02.500]  I think there's a safety to this.
[53:03.260 --> 53:08.500]  I would have a two-factor verification code pancake to me. A pancake scan.
[53:10.200 --> 53:18.220]  I like the idea of Ethan Hunt reading his mission, and then it says it will self-destruct in 60 seconds, and then syrup and a fork just pops out of it.
[53:19.560 --> 53:22.280]  I love that you go to work and you're like, uh...
[53:22.280 --> 53:25.380]  You're like, hey, did you read that thing about what's going on in the Netherlands?
[53:25.660 --> 53:27.380]  And he's like, nah, but I tasted it.
[53:28.860 --> 53:30.520]  No, I was too hungry, I didn't read it.
[53:30.860 --> 53:32.520]  It's a little too burnt today.
[53:34.140 --> 53:37.100]  Oh, wait, I already cut into the horoscopes, fuck.
[53:37.560 --> 53:37.920]  Yeah.
[53:38.340 --> 53:39.900]  I'm imagining you could do it, you know those...
[53:39.900 --> 53:43.060]  You're like, ah, fuck, who died at 78? Who died at 78?
[53:44.420 --> 53:47.120]  You know those pin things that you could push your face into?
[53:48.220 --> 53:48.480]  Yeah.
[53:48.740 --> 53:52.920]  If the top of the waffle maker was made of them, and that's how it would update.
[53:54.200 --> 53:55.680]  And then that would press your waffle.
[53:56.120 --> 54:00.580]  How many waffles do you think it would take to put a newspaper on it?
[54:01.500 --> 54:04.960]  I feel like a pancake would work better. Like a pancake machine.
[54:05.680 --> 54:11.560]  And then how many flapjacks do you think it would take to have all the news of a newspaper be on a flapjack?
[54:12.040 --> 54:14.740]  I feel like you could get three headlines on a pancake.
[54:16.820 --> 54:19.060]  So we're doing headlines only? We're not doing stories?
[54:19.320 --> 54:21.680]  Yeah, no, it's gonna have to be bullet points, right?
[54:21.880 --> 54:27.080]  I think it depends on how many waffles you enter into the waffle maker that morning.
[54:27.120 --> 54:32.760]  If you're gonna have three, you could have headline and then the subtext under it per pancake.
[54:33.220 --> 54:35.760]  But if you're just making one, then it'll just squeeze three headlines on one pancake.
[54:35.760 --> 54:38.660]  I mean, I think that's what... it probably... it's smart enough to give you an option.
[54:38.800 --> 54:41.140]  It's like, do you just want the headlines of these four stories?
[54:41.140 --> 54:45.160]  Or do you want to drill in on this one story and just get a full pancake on this?
[54:45.280 --> 54:46.940]  And then you dial it in.
[54:47.100 --> 54:52.080]  Sorry I'm late for work. I didn't realize the road was closed because I didn't eat four pancakes this morning.
[54:52.440 --> 54:53.640]  I stopped at three.
[54:53.900 --> 54:56.740]  Well, that's the same with every news. You're not gonna read every headline every day.
[54:57.180 --> 54:58.280]  You stop somewhere.
[55:01.960 --> 55:03.740]  I exclusively eat the funnies.
[55:05.880 --> 55:08.860]  What do you think the best section of the newspaper would be to eat? Would it be the funnies?
[55:08.860 --> 55:11.760]  Oh, the games. Yeah, the crossword. 100%.
[55:11.760 --> 55:16.340]  What's... what's six down... what does this... fuck it, I'm just deening it.
[55:16.540 --> 55:17.620]  We're just done. We're open.
[55:20.180 --> 55:20.880]  Did it.
[55:22.780 --> 55:23.740]  Oh, man.
[55:24.940 --> 55:25.420]  So...
[55:26.380 --> 55:30.580]  You guys got any more podcasts left or is this where we end the show?
[55:31.860 --> 55:32.820]  Oh, that's one.
[55:33.780 --> 55:35.680]  We could do the... we could do grip strength.
[55:35.940 --> 55:37.640]  We could do the base grip strength.
[55:39.180 --> 55:41.180]  Yeah, well, we did that. I sent mine in.
[55:41.460 --> 55:42.720]  Yeah, I...
[55:43.380 --> 55:45.160]  I think I said on the show...
[55:45.160 --> 55:49.520]  Gracie slacked me and said, so are you going to mail me the results for that?
[55:49.860 --> 55:56.700]  And that's ridiculous, but I guess I said that and I completely understand why she would think that that was the thing I would do.
[55:57.160 --> 55:58.100]  That that seemed realistic.
[55:58.480 --> 55:59.940]  But there was a need for a double check.
[56:00.360 --> 56:01.220]  No, I just sent it in.
[56:01.560 --> 56:02.400]  It seemed like too much work.
[56:03.280 --> 56:04.900]  I didn't think the bang was worth the buck.
[56:05.640 --> 56:06.680]  Buck was worth the bang?
[56:06.680 --> 56:09.360]  Do you want to... do you want to explain this?
[56:09.780 --> 56:10.980]  Do you want to bang the buck out of this?
[56:10.980 --> 56:11.180]  The grip strength?
[56:11.880 --> 56:12.500]  Yeah, what we're doing.
[56:12.520 --> 56:14.760]  We already talked about it, didn't we? We already established this.
[56:14.960 --> 56:17.420]  Yeah, like a fucking four episodes ago and nobody's going to remember.
[56:17.640 --> 56:18.660]  Maybe we do like a...
[56:18.660 --> 56:24.960]  So, Andrew and I have decided to see how much we can raise our grip strength in the year 2024.
[56:25.440 --> 56:29.820]  So we're going to set a bog standard normal baseline grip strength test in January.
[56:30.060 --> 56:33.900]  And then in December, we're going to test our grip strength again and see who was able to get stronger.
[56:33.900 --> 56:39.040]  Do they at the... do every four games of a football... like basketball, do they say,
[56:39.300 --> 56:42.280]  we're trying to win games to win the championship at the end of it?
[56:42.820 --> 56:43.580]  Why are we recapping?
[56:43.580 --> 56:46.160]  There's been no game between this and the last four episodes.
[56:46.340 --> 56:49.540]  We just mentioned it once for 30 seconds in an hour long.
[56:49.580 --> 56:49.840]  We established it.
[56:50.280 --> 56:51.100]  Oh my God.
[56:51.320 --> 56:52.460]  Did we not establish it?
[56:52.680 --> 56:53.840]  What gets mentioned now?
[56:54.480 --> 56:55.460]  That's what I'm saying.
[56:55.660 --> 56:58.660]  The baseline! I'm just explaining to the audience that if they're like,
[56:58.700 --> 57:01.440]  I don't remember why they're doing the base... why are they testing their...
[57:01.440 --> 57:03.840]  Like, shouldn't we list our grip strength now?
[57:03.840 --> 57:06.780]  So that we can see the progress a year later? You want to keep it secret?
[57:07.220 --> 57:09.380]  Yeah, I thought the whole point was we were keeping it secret.
[57:09.580 --> 57:15.640]  And then we would see what Eric, Gavin's, and Nick's, and Gracie's is at the end,
[57:15.720 --> 57:18.280]  and then we reveal where we started and where we finished.
[57:18.700 --> 57:19.960]  Wait, I'm involved in this?
[57:20.400 --> 57:21.960]  I think it's funny to see if...
[57:21.960 --> 57:26.280]  Apparently there was a lot of... a lot of shit didn't get communicated to anybody else but Andrew in this.
[57:26.280 --> 57:27.540]  I said it in the show!
[57:28.340 --> 57:28.860]  Did you?
[57:29.040 --> 57:32.040]  Yeah, but it feels like maybe we should reset it, you know what I mean?
[57:32.400 --> 57:32.920]  Yeah, it's fine.
[57:33.360 --> 57:37.180]  Thanks for listening to the F*** Face Podcast. We're going to see you next week.
[57:37.340 --> 57:42.020]  We'll be back, we'll have an even better episode than this one, which is going to be hard to top,
[57:42.180 --> 57:45.820]  because this was a fucking banger out the gate. Slap, slap, slap!
[57:46.060 --> 57:48.100]  It was slapping up and down all day long!
[57:48.480 --> 57:51.000]  Think about it, what's the longest dick on earth?
[57:51.340 --> 57:52.180]  Tune in next time!
[57:53.540 --> 57:58.080]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[57:58.240 --> 58:01.160]  We're going noteless. Gracie is having pet issues.
[58:01.160 --> 58:03.160]  Another trucker enters the fold.
[58:03.540 --> 58:05.300]  Geoff is bending the rules again.
[58:05.680 --> 58:06.800]  It's time to buy a blimp.
[58:07.180 --> 58:08.480]  Lots of video game talk.
[58:08.820 --> 58:10.220]  Eric loves a long podcast.
[58:10.680 --> 58:12.860]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[58:13.340 --> 58:16.000]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
[58:29.630 --> 58:30.850]  Hey, this is Andrew.
[58:31.310 --> 58:35.930]  I wanted to record this because I was blindsided by my cock award.
[58:36.910 --> 58:38.090]  And it caught me off guard.
[58:38.630 --> 58:40.270]  It was something that meant a lot to me.
[58:40.750 --> 58:41.410]  It was really touching.
[58:41.410 --> 58:45.130]  I know it's just like an award that is made up.
[58:45.290 --> 58:47.570]  But all awards are just things that are made up.
[58:47.810 --> 58:52.350]  And the fact that my friends went through the process of giving me one means a lot.
[58:52.450 --> 58:53.290]  I have it on my desk.
[58:54.030 --> 58:57.830]  And it's really stupid, but it's really important to me.
[58:58.810 --> 59:00.290]  In a silly way, I guess.
[59:00.690 --> 59:02.670]  I don't know if it's silly. I don't know. I'm bad at this.
[59:02.730 --> 59:06.050]  Anyway, I salad creamed the f*** out of my acceptance speech.
[59:06.350 --> 59:08.030]  Because I was not prepared for that.
[59:08.030 --> 59:12.630]  And I also, I don't know, it felt strange to suddenly shift into more honest discussion about it.
[59:13.010 --> 59:15.750]  But thankfully this exists.
[59:15.870 --> 59:18.150]  And I'm able to redo this.
[59:18.290 --> 59:21.810]  So this is my second attempt at an acceptance speech.
[59:21.930 --> 59:23.370]  Which, what is more f*** face than that?
[59:23.430 --> 59:25.490]  Than trying to do another acceptance speech.
[59:26.110 --> 59:30.810]  So I'm talking about receiving my wonderful back award.
[59:30.970 --> 59:31.890]  Longest back of RT.
[59:32.490 --> 59:37.230]  I first have to thank Geoff Ramsey for being just an unbelievable friend.
[59:37.230 --> 59:39.850]  And for believing in me when I didn't believe in myself.
[59:40.650 --> 59:44.190]  I need to thank Gavin for just being an endless joy.
[59:44.430 --> 59:46.470]  And elevating everything that he's a part of.
[59:46.630 --> 59:49.170]  And just being such a wonderful friend as well.
[59:50.130 --> 59:51.550]  I want to thank Eric.
[59:52.210 --> 59:55.910]  For being not just like an insanely great producer.
[59:56.190 --> 59:58.570]  But for being unbelievably funny.
[59:58.910 --> 01:00:01.370]  And somehow an even better person.
[01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:04.830]  It's been such a joy to get to know you through the process of making this show.
[01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:07.030]  Same goes to Nick.
[01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:10.290]  Nick is just so much fun to have around.
[01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:15.490]  And I can't believe that we went through like 100 episodes without him being in the background.
[01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:16.490]  Just being muted.
[01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:20.530]  He is such a warm person to be around.
[01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:24.950]  And I thank you so much for not murdering me when we started.
[01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:27.710]  Because I had no idea what I was doing as far as recording audio goes.
[01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.430]  And I was an absolute disaster.
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.850]  I want to thank Gracie.
[01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:34.710]  Who is relatively new to our team.
[01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:38.570]  But has immediately fit in and provided so much.
[01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:40.530]  And is just a really awesome person.
[01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:44.470]  I am so excited that you're part of our group.
[01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:48.310]  And just seeing where things will go.
[01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:50.810]  And the content that we've done so far.
[01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:53.890]  It has been nothing but pleasant surprises.
[01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:56.570]  And I'm just so glad that you're part of our group.
[01:00:57.230 --> 01:01:00.550]  And I also want to thank Kelly who edits almost all of these.
[01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:04.250]  I don't get to interact with Kelly as much as I would like to.
[01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:06.730]  But you do such an amazing job.
[01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:08.810]  And I appreciate what you do so much.
[01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:13.490]  And it makes me always so happy when you pop into the Slack and share a show thing.
[01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:22.230]  Obviously my family and my partner for allowing me to invest so much into something so silly.
[01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:25.470]  And always being so supportive and loving to me.
[01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:26.850]  I'm very lucky to have that.
[01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:31.090]  And then as well as thank you so much to our amazing community.
[01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:35.390]  Who allow us to create all this ridiculous stuff.
[01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:37.970]  And support us in all of the ways that you do.
[01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:42.890]  This show has helped me in so many ways.
[01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:46.830]  And having that time that I get to spend with my friends.
[01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:49.050]  And just be silly in a time period.
[01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:52.070]  In which so many difficult things have happened in the world.
[01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:55.110]  As well as my personal life has been invaluable.
[01:01:55.110 --> 01:02:00.890]  I don't know how I would have managed through some of the events of the last 3 or 4 years.
[01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:04.770]  Thank you so much for supporting us.
[01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:06.790]  And for just being amazing.
[01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:10.910]  So that's it. That is my proper acceptance speech.
[01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:13.410]  I love you all so much. Thank you.
[01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:16.210]  And if you have a really long back.
[01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:18.490]  Please don't apply to Rooster Teeth.
[01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.810]  Because that's my lane.
[01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:22.350]  I don't have many lanes.
[01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:23.510]  That's the one lane I have.
[01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:24.730]  You find your own lane.
[01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:27.450]  Maybe like a regular ears or something.
[01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:28.030]  I don't know.
[01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:29.710]  But you figure it out.
[01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:30.690]  That's not my problem.
[01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:32.530]  Just stay away if you have a long back.
[01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:33.950]  And I say that respectfully.
[01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.910]  Bye.
