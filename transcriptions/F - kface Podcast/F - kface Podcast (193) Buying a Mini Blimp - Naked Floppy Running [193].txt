[00:10.320 --> 00:15.120]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:15.660 --> 00:22.120]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always, I gotta be honest with you, it's the most
[00:22.120 --> 00:28.400]  talented bunch of boys and girls in the whole podcasting industry. Clearly I'm talking about
[00:28.400 --> 00:32.880]  Andrew Pantin from all the way up in Vancouver Island, Canada. Andrew, I have to ask you
[00:32.880 --> 00:35.260]  real fast. Are your ankles strong today?
[00:35.520 --> 00:36.680]  Oh, 100%. 100%
[00:36.680 --> 00:38.460]  How are your... are your teeth firm?
[00:39.400 --> 00:43.300]  Teeth are fine. Well, yeah, they're okay. Knee is f***ed, but we're fine. We're good.
[00:43.500 --> 00:46.500]  Well, maybe... maybe we can get into the knee a little bit, but I gotta say...
[00:46.500 --> 00:48.660]  Oh, we did. The Swiffer issue. Still recovering, but it's fine.
[00:48.680 --> 00:51.880]  Right, right, right. So you're still just working through that. Well, I hope...
[00:51.880 --> 00:55.120]  I hope it's a swift recovery, not to be... not to be funny there.
[00:56.560 --> 00:59.160]  Gavin, my best friend in the whole world,
[01:03.760 --> 01:07.380]  wunderkindfilmingextraordinaire, you far more successful in your other career as a slow-mo
[01:07.380 --> 01:09.760]  guy. How are you doing today, man? How you been?
[01:10.220 --> 01:10.800]  Firm teeth.
[01:11.720 --> 01:14.060]  Good, good. Were your teeth in question?
[01:14.800 --> 01:14.980]  Nope.
[01:15.380 --> 01:16.660]  They were not on the injury report.
[01:17.480 --> 01:20.460]  Now, I hear lately you haven't... you haven't been sleeping well.
[01:20.480 --> 01:23.160]  Yeah, there's nothing new there, though. I mean, I'm a shit sleeper.
[01:23.800 --> 01:27.640]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe... have you ever tried any homeopathic remedies?
[01:28.440 --> 01:30.420]  Like huffing a bunch of shite?
[01:30.860 --> 01:35.280]  Well, there's probably a healthier way to express that. But yeah, there might be some
[01:35.280 --> 01:39.280]  solutions you could look into. Maybe yoga, or maybe... I know a lot of people find
[01:40.520 --> 01:44.720]  transcendental meditation helps them with their sleep. But it's not just you guys and me here.
[01:44.800 --> 01:51.640]  It's also Eric, producer extraordinaire, Nick, and Gracie. You guys are somewhere back there
[01:51.640 --> 01:55.740]  in the weeds, making everything happen, keeping us on our toes, as it were.
[01:55.920 --> 01:55.980]  Hi.
[01:55.980 --> 01:58.420]  Hello. How you doing today, Gracie? How's your dog?
[01:58.900 --> 02:03.820]  My dog is asleep on the wooden floor, but she did pee and poop in the kitchen this morning.
[02:05.280 --> 02:08.220]  Could be a sign of distress or illness. You want to take a...
[02:08.800 --> 02:12.860]  I think it's a sign of her losing bowel control at her old age.
[02:13.640 --> 02:17.080]  Oh, that's... I'm sorry to hear that. I must admit I went through that
[02:17.080 --> 02:19.160]  with two dogs recently. It's heartbreaking.
[02:19.380 --> 02:20.500]  It's okay. She looks great doing it.
[02:21.020 --> 02:24.580]  I'll be honest with you. I'm going to have you in my prayers. I'm going to be thinking about you.
[02:24.640 --> 02:25.240]  You and the dog.
[02:25.540 --> 02:27.860]  Gracie's dog is a model.
[02:27.860 --> 02:29.420]  It's stunning and perfect. Don't say anything about her.
[02:29.980 --> 02:34.340]  She's a model. She got tapped to be a model.
[02:35.180 --> 02:36.560]  Wow. For what?
[02:36.760 --> 02:38.700]  Like a canine incontinence model or...
[02:39.760 --> 02:45.980]  Well, maybe a little bit. She modeled for a pet supplement brand.
[02:46.500 --> 02:49.300]  Did they photoshop Tim Allen's eyes on it?
[02:50.900 --> 02:56.760]  No. She has pretty little eyes. Non-human like eyes.
[02:57.440 --> 03:00.420]  Hey, hey, Nick, how's the Bambino? How's your dog?
[03:00.680 --> 03:01.040]  It's good.
[03:01.380 --> 03:03.520]  Oh, they're doing great, man. We're having a good time.
[03:03.520 --> 03:05.640]  I don't know what Geoff's doing.
[03:05.720 --> 03:08.960]  I'm so glad to hear it. I'm so glad to hear that everybody seems to be doing well.
[03:09.420 --> 03:12.860]  Thriving and surviving, even though there's clearly some difficulties in all of our lives.
[03:12.920 --> 03:15.960]  You guys don't seem to be letting it get you down. You're maintaining a positive attitude.
[03:15.960 --> 03:16.440]  How are you, Geoff?
[03:16.460 --> 03:19.460]  I want you to know I appreciate that. Well, I'm doing really well, too. Thanks for asking,
[03:19.580 --> 03:26.020]  Gavin. I got no complaints. I have the new puppy myself, so that can be a little bit of a handful,
[03:26.260 --> 03:29.520]  but I'm working through it. What do you guys want to talk about today?
[03:29.740 --> 03:33.340]  I would just like to make an update for my introduction. I'd like to be referred to as
[03:33.340 --> 03:37.200]  the COC winner, Andrew Pantin, from now. We can do that. Going forward. Absolutely.
[03:37.320 --> 03:41.100]  The big COC win last week. It's a great trophy. Thank you so much for that.
[03:41.440 --> 03:43.260]  Referred to as the Canadian COC winner?
[03:43.920 --> 03:48.880]  Whatever, any variation, as long as it's included. The Vancouver COC winner?
[03:49.400 --> 03:50.120]  Oh, could be.
[03:51.280 --> 03:55.680]  It makes me uneasy that I never know what a recording is going to be like.
[03:56.760 --> 03:57.040]  Yeah.
[03:57.420 --> 04:02.700]  Let's get into that. What do you think that comes from, Gavin? That's interesting.
[04:02.700 --> 04:03.980]  I think you.
[04:05.820 --> 04:10.480]  All right. When you say me in specific, like you never...
[04:10.480 --> 04:11.140]  You're doing something for me.
[04:11.140 --> 04:14.600]  Oh, is it because we don't always go over notes ahead of time?
[04:15.100 --> 04:16.900]  We never go over notes ahead of time.
[04:17.580 --> 04:20.580]  I agree. It is always a bit of a mystery what we're going to walk into,
[04:20.660 --> 04:24.380]  but I think that's part of the fun of what we do here, guys, right? Guys and girls.
[04:24.700 --> 04:28.260]  I would say it's more to do with the consistency of the people.
[04:29.680 --> 04:32.220]  Interesting. Why don't we peel back those layers?
[04:33.820 --> 04:40.360]  Well, I feel like I'm single layered. I enter pretty much the same every week.
[04:40.820 --> 04:42.900]  It's quite predictable, I think.
[04:43.560 --> 04:50.080]  And to you, you see value in predictability is what I'm surmising from that statement.
[04:50.300 --> 04:51.580]  Would that be correct?
[04:51.860 --> 04:56.780]  I just want to be a reliable constant in the lives of my friends.
[04:56.780 --> 05:02.660]  Oh, well, if that is if that is your stated goal, let me tell you, Gavin,
[05:02.720 --> 05:05.120]  you have hit a home run every day that we've been friends.
[05:05.380 --> 05:11.680]  You definitely have achieved that over and over and over again.
[05:11.720 --> 05:16.920]  A bastion of steadfastness is what I would refer to you as.
[05:18.640 --> 05:25.540]  Can I talk about something or talk about consistency and all that stuff and being a good friend?
[05:25.540 --> 05:28.800]  As Gavin, I mean, it's really it's my fault.
[05:28.920 --> 05:33.060]  But Gavin has been a consistent pain in my ass for like the last two and a half,
[05:33.160 --> 05:34.600]  three months, and he doesn't even know.
[05:35.580 --> 05:38.800]  He put me in a nightmare of my own doing, Geoff.
[05:39.320 --> 05:41.580]  Oh, no, I don't even remember.
[05:41.900 --> 05:43.940]  No, it's OK. It's fine. You don't need that's a little much.
[05:44.080 --> 05:46.380]  It's OK. Gavin doesn't know he's done this, right?
[05:46.560 --> 05:50.920]  He doesn't know. I bet you Gavin has forgot that he's even done this to me.
[05:50.980 --> 05:53.700]  I bet Gavin is confused and guilty right now and doesn't know why.
[05:53.700 --> 05:56.560]  So let's get to the bottom of this so he doesn't drag that feeling.
[05:56.800 --> 05:58.660]  I don't even remember how it started.
[05:58.900 --> 06:04.280]  But I had the thought of, I wonder if I could find a place in Austin
[06:04.280 --> 06:07.020]  and if Gavin would be able to find it on Google.
[06:07.100 --> 06:08.520]  We're talking about Google Maps stuff.
[06:08.840 --> 06:10.200]  Oh, I remember this. Yeah.
[06:10.440 --> 06:15.060]  Yeah. So I picked a random spot on Google Maps and sent it to Gavin.
[06:15.160 --> 06:17.240]  Be like, it's going to take him forever to find this.
[06:17.360 --> 06:22.540]  And Gavin determined the location within about 10 minutes, maybe.
[06:22.540 --> 06:24.980]  And it turns out that the place.
[06:25.460 --> 06:28.040]  Yeah, the place I had picked Gavin had been to twice.
[06:28.180 --> 06:30.580]  It was a random coffee shop that I picked
[06:31.520 --> 06:35.780]  and he had been there on two separate occasions and he instantly found one.
[06:35.940 --> 06:37.960]  And then he said to me, do you want one?
[06:38.360 --> 06:39.020]  And I said, sure.
[06:39.120 --> 06:41.200]  You know, like I live in a much smaller place.
[06:41.220 --> 06:42.080]  It'd be easier for me.
[06:42.460 --> 06:46.860]  So Gavin sent me a photo of a house and I have not been able to find this
[06:46.860 --> 06:49.320]  fucking house for like three months now.
[06:49.320 --> 06:52.580]  And I've been roaming the streets of Google Maps.
[06:52.900 --> 06:55.820]  Sometimes I just go for a drive and I just drive around,
[06:55.880 --> 06:59.000]  seeing if I can, because it's a very noticeable house.
[06:59.160 --> 07:01.080]  It's it's like I would recognize it immediately.
[07:01.640 --> 07:03.640]  The place you live, much smaller than Austin.
[07:04.160 --> 07:06.660]  So much smaller, as I said, it's a lot smaller of a community.
[07:06.780 --> 07:10.360]  So I thought, whatever, like, yeah, I'll do one and I'm sure I'll recognize it.
[07:10.580 --> 07:13.120]  But the angle and everything you picked, it's so hard to tell.
[07:13.180 --> 07:14.700]  It looks like it'd be so many places.
[07:15.100 --> 07:17.140]  Obviously not going to share a photo of this house,
[07:17.140 --> 07:20.620]  but I have been haunted by this stupid house that Gavin sent.
[07:20.860 --> 07:24.000]  And I thought that I would be the one making him on a chase for a while.
[07:24.100 --> 07:26.660]  Took him 10 minutes. I'm three months in, not any closer.
[07:28.460 --> 07:32.040]  I'm I'm nearing the point of having to make like a grid of the entire city
[07:32.040 --> 07:34.440]  and like marking off what streets I've been on.
[07:34.900 --> 07:39.440]  Now, is this a single family home from what you can tell?
[07:39.900 --> 07:40.560]  A two story.
[07:40.860 --> 07:42.800]  Like two story, like a freestanding?
[07:43.360 --> 07:43.640]  Yeah.
[07:44.020 --> 07:45.420]  OK, interesting, interesting.
[07:46.560 --> 07:50.840]  It is it feels like something you should be able to remember or recognize.
[07:50.980 --> 07:53.360]  And I have no idea where it is, but I've been I've been roaming
[07:53.360 --> 07:56.400]  the Internet streets whenever I have free time looking for this house.
[07:56.460 --> 07:58.280]  And it is so annoying that I haven't found it yet.
[07:58.440 --> 08:00.620]  I can understand how that'd be pretty perplexing.
[08:01.260 --> 08:05.600]  Gavin, this house, it is within the confines of Vancouver Island.
[08:05.960 --> 08:06.520]  Oh, big time.
[08:06.840 --> 08:08.240]  He's looking in the right place.
[08:08.240 --> 08:11.040]  He just it's kind of like finding a needle in a haystack, it sounds like.
[08:11.880 --> 08:12.700]  But it shouldn't be.
[08:12.700 --> 08:18.540]  It's like it's like a needle in a few strands of grass is more I'd say the analogy.
[08:18.760 --> 08:20.700]  It's definitely harder because I just picked some house,
[08:20.760 --> 08:24.280]  which is definitely a place you wouldn't have been unless I got really lucky.
[08:24.460 --> 08:28.380]  Whereas you gave me a much more easy one because I could tell by the
[08:29.200 --> 08:31.700]  sort of the look of it that it was pretty modern in Austin.
[08:31.880 --> 08:33.620]  And and then I realized I'd been there.
[08:33.700 --> 08:35.660]  And then I think I sent you a picture of me and Trevor.
[08:36.740 --> 08:38.060]  Yeah, I think you did.
[08:39.120 --> 08:40.440]  It's it was annoying.
[08:41.120 --> 08:41.940]  Do you remember?
[08:42.100 --> 08:43.220]  And I felt like you had done a magic trick.
[08:43.660 --> 08:47.880]  How cool would it be if you sent Gavin a picture of you and Trevor at this house?
[08:48.380 --> 08:50.440]  That would be, that would be a move.
[08:50.900 --> 08:51.880]  Something to shoot for, huh?
[08:52.440 --> 08:53.420]  Think about for sure.
[08:53.820 --> 08:58.920]  Andrew, do you remember when I exported that fruit throwing video for you without audio
[08:58.920 --> 09:02.280]  and then I exported my next actual video?
[09:02.600 --> 09:03.000]  Yes.
[09:03.160 --> 09:03.800]  And I didn't have audio.
[09:03.960 --> 09:04.320]  Do you remember that?
[09:04.380 --> 09:05.500]  Do you remember the text I sent you?
[09:06.220 --> 09:06.620]  No.
[09:07.960 --> 09:10.080]  I feel like we go over that text every episode.
[09:10.080 --> 09:11.020]  I'm surprised you don't remember.
[09:12.360 --> 09:15.880]  Well, I sent you a text and you thought I was talking about something else.
[09:17.060 --> 09:18.520]  What did I think you were talking about?
[09:20.120 --> 09:22.020]  Uh, well, I was hoping you would remember, to be honest.
[09:22.160 --> 09:23.020]  Let me go back to the message.
[09:23.240 --> 09:24.380]  I don't remember any of this.
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.680]  You don't remember when I said, like, you've screwed me?
[09:28.520 --> 09:29.660]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I remember that.
[09:29.720 --> 09:30.320]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:30.340 --> 09:31.860]  OK, yeah, I know what we're talking about now.
[09:31.960 --> 09:32.020]  Yeah.
[09:32.020 --> 09:34.220]  What did you think I was talking about?
[09:35.660 --> 09:36.860]  Well, we were...
[09:38.240 --> 09:40.580]  Did it ever come into play, Gracie?
[09:41.000 --> 09:41.940]  What I was talking about?
[09:42.280 --> 09:42.860]  Damn, Gracie.
[09:42.880 --> 09:43.960]  Because there was a possibility.
[09:45.140 --> 09:45.380]  The...
[09:45.380 --> 09:49.460]  Remember the thing I dictated for a shoot?
[09:49.460 --> 09:50.260]  A long time ago?
[09:50.620 --> 09:50.920]  Yeah.
[09:51.660 --> 09:52.600]  Did that ever happen?
[09:53.100 --> 09:56.780]  Because there was a possibility on the second day that they could have arrived.
[09:57.740 --> 09:59.720]  And that's the last I heard about it.
[10:00.900 --> 10:03.040]  Wait, I need you to slack me.
[10:03.040 --> 10:05.340]  OK, I'm just...
[10:05.340 --> 10:06.580]  We're going to skip this part.
[10:06.720 --> 10:07.560]  I'll just go right into it.
[10:07.780 --> 10:08.600]  So we did...
[10:08.600 --> 10:09.560]  You guys did Does It Do?
[10:09.940 --> 10:11.700]  And it was sponsored by Shady Rays.
[10:11.880 --> 10:13.140]  And at the time...
[10:13.140 --> 10:13.720]  Oh, I found it.
[10:13.760 --> 10:14.300]  I found the message.
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.100]  Yeah, I thought...
[10:16.100 --> 10:17.520]  Because you said you fucked me.
[10:17.680 --> 10:17.840]  Yeah.
[10:17.920 --> 10:21.140]  And you said, you look like the coolest kid in third grade.
[10:21.520 --> 10:22.500]  Yes, because...
[10:22.500 --> 10:26.940]  Then, like an hour later, you said, wait, what do you think I did?
[10:27.300 --> 10:29.840]  And I explained what I was talking about.
[10:29.840 --> 10:34.080]  And you said disregard my original response to this conversation.
[10:34.120 --> 10:37.780]  And I realized I never followed up on what the goddamn you were talking about.
[10:38.200 --> 10:39.440]  Now I know what you're talking about.
[10:39.580 --> 10:41.200]  And Andrew, it didn't end up happening.
[10:41.380 --> 10:42.160]  Oh, that's sad.
[10:42.260 --> 10:42.680]  That's too bad.
[10:43.140 --> 10:46.000]  So Shady Rays, kind enough to sponsor Does It Do?
[10:46.580 --> 10:47.680]  And it was...
[10:47.680 --> 10:52.360]  You two were asked what sunglasses you would like to wear during the video to do it.
[10:52.680 --> 10:54.900]  But I think it was around the time of your wedding, Geoff.
[10:54.980 --> 10:57.040]  So neither of you were around.
[10:57.040 --> 11:00.220]  I said, if they don't answer you, I will do this.
[11:00.320 --> 11:01.660]  I'll pick four of them.
[11:02.220 --> 11:04.100]  And so I picked you a really cool...
[11:04.100 --> 11:05.940]  I think it was like the Falcon or something, Geoff.
[11:06.000 --> 11:07.700]  I picked you some cool pair of glasses.
[11:08.120 --> 11:10.520]  And then I picked Gavin something that reminded me of like
[11:10.520 --> 11:14.720]  what I would have thought was really cool in third grade and looked ridiculous.
[11:15.560 --> 11:18.600]  And you sent me, without context, the day of the first shoot,
[11:18.940 --> 11:23.080]  you fucked me, which perfectly aligned with what I was going for.
[11:23.100 --> 11:26.140]  Because I just thought, even though they're a great looking pair of sunglasses,
[11:26.140 --> 11:30.360]  they would not, I think, fit with your personality or look at all.
[11:31.360 --> 11:33.600]  So that's what I thought you were talking about.
[11:33.860 --> 11:35.860]  And then I messaged Gracie about it.
[11:36.020 --> 11:39.700]  And she let me know that the sunglasses didn't actually arrive that I picked,
[11:39.960 --> 11:41.220]  that you're using different ones.
[11:41.400 --> 11:43.300]  So in which case, I had no idea.
[11:43.520 --> 11:46.600]  Then I had to circle back to you to figure out what I had done to you,
[11:46.880 --> 11:48.780]  which I still don't think was really my fault.
[11:49.240 --> 11:49.420]  Whoo!
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.860]  That's a big kerfuffle, guys.
[11:52.800 --> 11:53.800]  I think we straightened it out.
[11:54.240 --> 11:56.180]  Glad we got to the bottom of that.
[11:56.340 --> 12:01.000]  The pair of glasses that Emily took the other day after the break show were one of those pairs.
[12:01.620 --> 12:04.380]  I assumed that that's what they were when she took them.
[12:04.400 --> 12:05.900]  Looked good on her, though, I gotta say.
[12:05.980 --> 12:08.600]  Emily looked cool as fuck with those sunglasses.
[12:09.280 --> 12:10.940]  Those things were rad as shit.
[12:10.980 --> 12:11.380]  They were great.
[12:11.460 --> 12:11.920]  Hell yeah.
[12:12.500 --> 12:15.580]  That's a lot of expletives from Eric, but you can tell he means what he's saying.
[12:15.900 --> 12:16.960]  You gotta appreciate that.
[12:17.300 --> 12:18.080]  Goddamn right.
[12:18.920 --> 12:20.680]  All right, I like Nick chiming in.
[12:21.740 --> 12:23.100]  So does the audience, Nick.
[12:23.100 --> 12:26.700]  You're an audience favorite, and clearly for good reason.
[12:26.860 --> 12:27.580]  That's awesome.
[12:27.720 --> 12:32.000]  Let's take a quick poll of all the talent on the show real quick.
[12:32.520 --> 12:34.060]  Just, I have a couple of questions.
[12:34.800 --> 12:34.940]  Okay.
[12:35.100 --> 12:39.060]  One, does anyone think that Nick has worn the mask so far this year?
[12:39.520 --> 12:39.920]  No.
[12:40.020 --> 12:41.060]  I don't think so.
[12:41.480 --> 12:41.740]  Okay.
[12:41.780 --> 12:41.960]  No.
[12:42.940 --> 12:46.720]  Second question, how are we feeling about the Geoff in this episode?
[12:46.720 --> 12:53.460]  Um, it was, it's weird because it was pretty normal about 25 minutes ago.
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.360]  It isn't dramatic.
[12:58.560 --> 13:05.180]  We just recorded a bunch of stuff and Geoff, the tone has shifted in the past, which I really,
[13:05.220 --> 13:10.720]  I'm wondering if something happened in the 15 minutes between when we stopped and started this,
[13:11.080 --> 13:16.560]  where Geoff was alone, or if this is a calculated move going into this episode.
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.540]  Now, is that, uh, is that just, uh, thrown out to the group as a whole,
[13:22.620 --> 13:24.180]  or would you like me to, to address it?
[13:24.180 --> 13:25.980]  I feel like that was more pointed at you.
[13:26.360 --> 13:26.680]  Okay.
[13:27.300 --> 13:27.660]  I gotcha.
[13:27.860 --> 13:31.360]  Uh, well, I'm not sure if I'm being completely honest with you, Andrew,
[13:31.460 --> 13:33.280]  and I try to be at all opportunity.
[13:34.020 --> 13:36.140]  Uh, I'm trying to be honest with myself, trying to be honest with everybody.
[13:36.200 --> 13:39.240]  I think it's a, you know, it's an important trait in a human being to have.
[13:39.720 --> 13:43.900]  Uh, I, uh, I don't, I guess I don't know what you mean.
[13:44.440 --> 13:50.180]  Uh, if there's a difference in tone or a shift, I, I would personally attribute it
[13:50.180 --> 13:53.840]  to the fact that the previous content we were filming was video game content,
[13:54.040 --> 13:55.940]  and then this is podcast content.
[13:56.040 --> 13:59.560]  And so maybe, maybe there's some sort of, uh, maybe, maybe there's something in me
[13:59.560 --> 14:00.420]  that I don't even recognize.
[14:00.500 --> 14:04.820]  It's unconscious, where I, I, I switch roles slightly, or, or maybe I just, uh, haven't.
[14:05.240 --> 14:07.080]  There's been a slight shift in gear, I think.
[14:07.180 --> 14:08.460]  But I'm not looking at anything.
[14:08.460 --> 14:10.600]  I'm just like using my mind, theater of the mind, right?
[14:10.620 --> 14:12.900]  That's what we always say about the podcast.
[14:12.900 --> 14:17.460]  Yeah, and so, um, yeah, I guess I don't, I guess I just, I guess I'm not aware of it
[14:17.460 --> 14:17.920]  if it's there.
[14:18.380 --> 14:22.660]  Yeah, I would say it's, uh, you've shifted down at the used truck, the trucks terminal.
[14:22.840 --> 14:25.220]  I think you're getting out of the mud, is what it sounds like to me.
[14:25.220 --> 14:28.920]  Man, speaking of getting out of the mud, can I tell you guys, I played trucks last night
[14:28.920 --> 14:29.500]  for a couple hours.
[14:29.600 --> 14:31.740]  It was the first time we'd played in over a week.
[14:32.440 --> 14:35.880]  It, uh, it, we, we just hadn't been able to sync up and get together in a while.
[14:35.920 --> 14:37.160]  And then it wasn't working.
[14:37.280 --> 14:39.580]  It was, it was real bad the last few times we tried.
[14:39.580 --> 14:43.680]  But with the new DLC coming out, I thought, let's give it a shot.
[14:44.040 --> 14:46.800]  You know, let's give it the old college try, even though I didn't really go to college.
[14:47.400 --> 14:48.620]  And, uh, and it was working.
[14:48.680 --> 14:49.100]  It worked great.
[14:49.140 --> 14:50.720]  And we played for hours and hours last night.
[14:50.760 --> 14:54.640]  And I got so stuck in the mud and I got so unstuck in the mud and we did a bunch of missions
[14:54.640 --> 14:55.920]  and it was just a great time.
[14:56.300 --> 14:57.220]  Just a great time.
[14:57.540 --> 14:58.740]  Really happy that I got to do it.
[14:58.960 --> 15:00.780]  You guys been playing any fun video games lately?
[15:01.440 --> 15:07.360]  It's funny that you, you mentioned that, Geoff, there is a certain video game that is huge
[15:07.360 --> 15:09.060]  right now called POW World.
[15:09.720 --> 15:11.100]  Everybody's playing POW World.
[15:11.280 --> 15:12.460]  It's all over the place.
[15:13.260 --> 15:14.840]  Uh, I haven't tried it yet.
[15:15.360 --> 15:19.980]  And one of the main reasons I haven't played it yet, despite almost everybody I know playing it,
[15:20.260 --> 15:24.580]  is you brought up in our group text, maybe a week ago at this point,
[15:25.240 --> 15:26.880]  has anyone here played POW World?
[15:27.340 --> 15:29.180]  To which Gavin and I said, no.
[15:29.580 --> 15:32.960]  And then you replied to that by saying, maybe don't.
[15:33.060 --> 15:35.180]  Maybe it's a great first impression video.
[15:35.180 --> 15:40.260]  So despite everybody I know playing POW World, I decided I'm not going to play with my friends
[15:40.260 --> 15:42.480]  outside of the recordings or anything.
[15:42.740 --> 15:47.560]  I'm just, this is, I'm going to save it because Geoff thinks it would be a great first impressions
[15:47.560 --> 15:47.980]  video.
[15:48.200 --> 15:53.860]  And then we synced up this morning to record content and immediately I hear from Geoff about
[15:53.860 --> 15:57.000]  all of the countless hours of POW World he's been playing.
[15:57.400 --> 15:58.860]  And that he can't get enough of it.
[15:59.020 --> 16:00.340]  And we need to get in on this.
[16:00.480 --> 16:02.880]  And I quietly went, you son of a bitch.
[16:02.880 --> 16:07.220]  I have not been playing it because of your suggestion of it being a first few.
[16:07.640 --> 16:10.040]  And all you're doing is playing POW World at the moment.
[16:10.220 --> 16:13.600]  Okay, well, first of all, if you'd allow me the space to respond.
[16:13.660 --> 16:14.180]  Of course.
[16:14.760 --> 16:16.460]  And I appreciate you giving me the space.
[16:17.660 --> 16:21.460]  I, uh, Gavin, listen, it's my space right now.
[16:21.560 --> 16:24.960]  We'll give you all the space in the world when it's your time.
[16:25.080 --> 16:25.920]  I think that's only fair.
[16:26.760 --> 16:29.500]  Uh, I gotta be honest with you.
[16:29.560 --> 16:31.020]  I feel a little bit of ire from you.
[16:31.020 --> 16:33.020]  And that has my hackles up a bit.
[16:33.080 --> 16:35.260]  And I'm trying not to let that get the better of me.
[16:35.500 --> 16:41.060]  But, uh, I guess I would say I stand by what I said in that.
[16:41.220 --> 16:45.940]  I always find the best kind of content is when we can discover something for the first time
[16:45.940 --> 16:46.480]  on camera.
[16:46.620 --> 16:50.240]  It always creates the best possibility, as it were.
[16:50.560 --> 16:53.640]  Now, I didn't mean please don't play the game for the next week.
[16:53.720 --> 16:57.400]  I just meant if you guys haven't played it already, let's get in there and film a video
[16:57.980 --> 17:01.480]  whenever is convenient for y'all so that we can capture that first moment.
[17:01.560 --> 17:03.100]  Because I think it could be magical, right?
[17:03.600 --> 17:05.140]  And then I've been playing.
[17:05.520 --> 17:06.240]  Yeah, I've been playing.
[17:06.320 --> 17:07.140]  And I have been playing.
[17:07.220 --> 17:07.940]  And I'll continue to play.
[17:08.000 --> 17:08.560]  And here's why.
[17:08.860 --> 17:13.400]  Because I need to be a good steward in this game.
[17:13.540 --> 17:15.580]  I need to be able to lead you guys through it and understand.
[17:15.740 --> 17:18.200]  Imagine if we all were confused about trucks.
[17:18.560 --> 17:19.400]  Nobody would get anywhere.
[17:19.740 --> 17:22.960]  I had to put a couple hundred hours into trucks so that I could understand how to present it
[17:22.960 --> 17:24.240]  to you guys and how to help you along.
[17:24.240 --> 17:27.680]  And so I was kind of approaching Pal World in the same way.
[17:28.220 --> 17:32.100]  But if by all means, if you would like to play it on your own outside of the videos,
[17:32.100 --> 17:34.720]  I'm not trying to hold you back at all.
[17:35.320 --> 17:36.320]  But I would love to play it with you.
[17:36.360 --> 17:38.280]  You guys are my best friends in the whole world.
[17:38.600 --> 17:44.700]  And I would love to play my current obsession with you guys all the time, if possible.
[17:45.480 --> 17:48.780]  In your defense, I went back and I looked at the text and you never stated that you
[17:48.780 --> 17:49.720]  hadn't played it before.
[17:49.900 --> 17:51.360]  I just made that assumption.
[17:51.360 --> 17:56.000]  Uh, which I thought it was just very funny because I've been actively.
[17:56.380 --> 17:56.980]  Oh, you assume?
[17:57.140 --> 17:58.140]  Yeah, I didn't realize you assume.
[17:58.320 --> 18:02.020]  Yeah, that's that's that's that's a lack of communication on my part.
[18:02.120 --> 18:03.380]  I'm going to I'm going to write that down.
[18:03.420 --> 18:06.820]  I'm going to put a pin in that and I'm going to work on that in the future.
[18:07.060 --> 18:10.000]  That's something that I can do to improve our relationship.
[18:10.860 --> 18:14.340]  I'm really excited for when we get the trucks, too, because I've been playing a lot of trucks
[18:14.340 --> 18:15.720]  and I'm I'm out of the mud now.
[18:15.840 --> 18:21.260]  I think it's going to the the jump in my truck ability from video two to video three is vast.
[18:21.700 --> 18:22.720]  I'm ready for it.
[18:23.700 --> 18:26.460]  Uh, I gotta I can't go any further with this dumb thing.
[18:26.500 --> 18:27.000]  I gotta stop.
[18:27.960 --> 18:29.040]  I wore myself out.
[18:29.320 --> 18:30.280]  No, I appreciate that.
[18:30.360 --> 18:33.120]  Yeah, I did it as fucking long as I could.
[18:33.240 --> 18:37.380]  But I was I'm struggling so much to pay attention to it.
[18:37.640 --> 18:40.040]  It was like, oh, I don't know.
[18:40.140 --> 18:43.020]  I feel like if I was lying, if I was horizontal, I would have fallen asleep.
[18:43.180 --> 18:45.740]  Once I fucking started, I couldn't stop.
[18:45.900 --> 18:47.800]  And then I could just and here's the thing.
[18:47.800 --> 18:50.000]  It was I appreciated everybody rolling with it.
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.480]  And it was getting under Gavin's skin.
[18:51.620 --> 18:52.620]  And that just kept it going.
[18:52.820 --> 18:54.100]  I couldn't stop because of Gavin.
[18:54.360 --> 18:57.920]  Like every time every time I got close to winding down, he would sigh or go.
[18:57.980 --> 18:58.220]  Yeah.
[18:58.540 --> 19:02.000]  And then I was like, ah, you just thought of the five minutes, you little shit.
[19:02.320 --> 19:05.840]  Yeah, I didn't know what was happening, but I know you.
[19:05.880 --> 19:08.380]  So I was like, I just can't react negatively to this in any way.
[19:08.460 --> 19:10.240]  It'll eventually this is going to change.
[19:10.360 --> 19:11.040]  The tide will turn.
[19:11.320 --> 19:15.440]  That sigh must have been completely involuntary because it just flew out of me.
[19:18.580 --> 19:22.200]  I was like, how much of the episode is going to burn for this bit?
[19:22.420 --> 19:32.060]  I wanted to see if I could present a kinder, softer, gentler, more inclusive environment for us to play in.
[19:32.220 --> 19:35.180]  And I see now that that has no business here.
[19:35.680 --> 19:37.100]  Well, that's just not who we are.
[19:37.280 --> 19:37.840]  It's just not.
[19:37.960 --> 19:40.900]  Well, I think that the energy was more the issue.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.440]  I don't think it was was the tone.
[19:43.500 --> 19:44.240]  It was the pacing.
[19:44.240 --> 19:45.500]  It was your verbal pacing.
[19:45.560 --> 19:48.540]  I was just trying to keep everybody chill.
[19:48.640 --> 19:52.480]  I'm impressed with Andrew and his ability to roll with that for so long.
[19:52.480 --> 19:53.400]  Yeah, me too.
[19:53.500 --> 19:56.600]  I was not impressed with my ability to roll with that for that long.
[19:56.900 --> 19:59.460]  You could have you could have done that for four hours.
[19:59.680 --> 20:02.900]  Andrew kept going as though you were being a normal human.
[20:04.260 --> 20:04.820]  Gavin's right.
[20:04.880 --> 20:05.400]  A hundred percent.
[20:08.300 --> 20:10.340]  I don't think I could have kept that going for four hours.
[20:10.460 --> 20:11.600]  That's pretty, that's killing me.
[20:12.120 --> 20:14.640]  I kept it going as long as I physically could.
[20:15.220 --> 20:18.620]  And I think that that was a great depiction of who you are,
[20:18.680 --> 20:23.040]  Geoff, of you were doing this bit that you don't even really find funny anymore.
[20:23.040 --> 20:25.660]  But you're annoying Gavin and that brings you joy.
[20:25.900 --> 20:30.360]  And so you do it for almost 20 minutes because Gavin is so irritated.
[20:30.500 --> 20:31.700]  That was like a cold war.
[20:32.520 --> 20:33.140]  It was.
[20:33.680 --> 20:34.600]  In podcasting.
[20:36.620 --> 20:39.480]  That was a that was a civil cold war.
[20:39.480 --> 20:42.540]  I hate myself so much sometimes.
[20:42.600 --> 20:45.560]  I've done so much work not to hate myself in the grand school things,
[20:45.660 --> 20:47.060]  like getting over the alcohol and all that,
[20:47.140 --> 20:49.060]  and like learning to like myself and all the therapy and shit.
[20:49.300 --> 20:52.120]  But there are moments when I get stuck in like,
[20:52.460 --> 20:54.100]  and Eric, I'll speak in terms you can understand,
[20:54.280 --> 20:56.720]  I get stuck in my like bingey shtick coma.
[20:57.100 --> 20:59.520]  And I just I can't find a way out.
[21:00.140 --> 21:02.100]  I just won't like my brain won't let me.
[21:02.240 --> 21:05.220]  And then I just like fucking hate myself, but I can't do anything about it.
[21:05.340 --> 21:07.420]  When you started it at the top of the episode,
[21:07.420 --> 21:10.580]  I went, well, he didn't have this planned, but he just found this.
[21:10.780 --> 21:12.640]  So I guess we're going to see how long it goes for.
[21:12.820 --> 21:14.720]  And it went roughly 20 minutes.
[21:14.960 --> 21:16.140]  I didn't have a plan at all.
[21:16.180 --> 21:19.080]  It's just how my it's just yeah, I just noticed I was kind of chill.
[21:19.260 --> 21:21.680]  So I just thought I was trying to picture it.
[21:21.680 --> 21:24.600]  Like I was trying to figure out who wronged you between it between recording.
[21:24.920 --> 21:26.460]  But you didn't go anywhere.
[21:26.580 --> 21:28.820]  I don't think I was like, man, nobody wronged me.
[21:28.900 --> 21:32.100]  I was just worried something happened in like the small space between.
[21:32.480 --> 21:34.260]  I was just playing it chill, man.
[21:35.940 --> 21:38.920]  Yeah, chill, chill and helpful.
[21:39.060 --> 21:41.340]  I just want to give everybody space to communicate and talk.
[21:41.580 --> 21:44.320]  And, you know, I feel I have a chill update.
[21:45.020 --> 21:45.860]  Let's do it.
[21:45.980 --> 21:47.120]  Y'all persuaded me.
[21:47.240 --> 21:49.500]  You made me come into the fold.
[21:50.020 --> 21:50.940]  You're doing the marathon.
[21:51.460 --> 21:52.080]  I'm streaming.
[21:52.320 --> 21:52.980]  No, he's streaming.
[21:53.160 --> 21:53.740]  I'm streaming.
[21:53.900 --> 21:54.660]  You're a streamer.
[21:54.660 --> 21:55.860]  I got my stream set.
[21:56.080 --> 21:56.340]  Mm hmm.
[21:56.720 --> 21:58.800]  What's your favorite stream flavor so far?
[21:59.400 --> 22:00.060]  So here's the thing.
[22:00.080 --> 22:02.540]  I haven't got any of the syrup yet for it.
[22:04.740 --> 22:08.060]  I've been carbonating juices and having a great time.
[22:08.180 --> 22:12.440]  I did some carbonated orange juice the other day, did some cranberry raspberry yesterday.
[22:12.900 --> 22:13.460]  This is great.
[22:13.640 --> 22:14.700]  I'm having a great time.
[22:14.820 --> 22:18.680]  Is a carbonated orange juice essentially just an orange Julius?
[22:19.540 --> 22:20.440]  Yeah, it is.
[22:20.480 --> 22:21.640]  It was sort of unnerving.
[22:21.760 --> 22:25.260]  It's a little bit slightly different of a taste, but yeah, it's a very similar.
[22:25.400 --> 22:26.500]  That's a great comparable.
[22:27.040 --> 22:28.780]  It feels very fancy, too.
[22:29.180 --> 22:31.420]  Yeah, we could open up our own mall store.
[22:31.420 --> 22:34.500]  Yeah, we just like sell carbonated juices to people.
[22:34.720 --> 22:37.560]  Or they bring their own juice and we just carbonate it.
[22:39.460 --> 22:42.700]  Yeah, it's like a it's like a BYOJC kind of thing.
[22:45.100 --> 22:46.520]  Bring your own juice to carbonate.
[22:46.820 --> 22:48.160]  This is fucking that's the name of our store.
[22:50.120 --> 22:52.380]  Did we did we talk about for Unifarm?
[22:52.700 --> 22:56.800]  I know, Geoff, you were talking about the key that you shove in a that you wrap toothpaste
[22:56.800 --> 22:58.360]  tubes around and squeeze it all out.
[22:58.940 --> 23:00.960]  Did we talk about Unifarm making one of those?
[23:01.780 --> 23:02.140]  No.
[23:02.620 --> 23:04.420]  Because I could go pretty well with the bread clip.
[23:05.480 --> 23:06.180]  You think so?
[23:06.300 --> 23:07.420]  I don't know how to improve upon it.
[23:07.480 --> 23:08.180]  It's already a perfect.
[23:08.440 --> 23:10.880]  Yeah, that's the that's the problem is like Unifarm.
[23:11.040 --> 23:13.920]  Unifarm is not just about logo slapping uniforms about innovation.
[23:14.820 --> 23:16.340]  Yeah, but I think we can innovate.
[23:16.640 --> 23:17.600]  I'm going to get in the lab.
[23:17.700 --> 23:18.480]  I'll tell you that right now.
[23:18.540 --> 23:21.140]  You've challenged me to get in the lab and see how we can innovate.
[23:21.520 --> 23:24.260]  How we can innovate toothpaste.
[23:24.940 --> 23:28.720]  And as Nick says, based on our previous stuff, slap a magnet on it.
[23:29.280 --> 23:30.280]  Slap a magnet.
[23:30.280 --> 23:34.780]  I have a question for you guys about the streaming because you're ahead of me on the curve.
[23:35.460 --> 23:39.840]  Currently, I have all of the like bottles for it.
[23:39.920 --> 23:44.440]  They could be the compressed whatever carbonation just in my room.
[23:44.480 --> 23:45.500]  Where should I store this?
[23:45.880 --> 23:48.120]  Where should I store the CO2 type things?
[23:48.400 --> 23:51.520]  Well, that might be like the CO2 canister.
[23:51.820 --> 23:52.780]  Yeah, the canister.
[23:53.060 --> 23:53.860]  How many do you have carbon?
[23:54.120 --> 23:55.260]  So that's the thing.
[23:55.300 --> 23:55.980]  I bought two.
[23:56.060 --> 23:57.340]  They they sent me four.
[23:57.660 --> 23:59.320]  I have four of them currently.
[24:00.320 --> 24:02.200]  And they're just all around my room.
[24:02.440 --> 24:05.020]  And if somebody who plays a lot of first person shooters,
[24:05.360 --> 24:08.800]  I feel like I'm in an explosive war zone right now.
[24:09.400 --> 24:12.240]  Anytime like when I see when my brain just immediately goes,
[24:12.320 --> 24:14.480]  someone's going to shoot that fire is going to shoot out the side,
[24:14.560 --> 24:15.400]  then it's going to blow up.
[24:15.760 --> 24:16.380]  Are they red?
[24:16.720 --> 24:17.840]  No, they're white.
[24:17.920 --> 24:19.120]  Well, then I think you're probably fine.
[24:19.400 --> 24:20.020]  Yeah, they're fine.
[24:20.080 --> 24:22.860]  OK, yeah, they're only they're only flammable if they're red.
[24:23.040 --> 24:24.900]  Yeah, only red barrels and canisters explode.
[24:25.340 --> 24:28.080]  I would put them in your closet so you don't have to look at them anymore.
[24:28.080 --> 24:30.500]  But, you know, I don't know.
[24:30.620 --> 24:31.820]  I don't I only have one.
[24:32.060 --> 24:34.040]  And it's the one that's in this the SodaStream.
[24:34.140 --> 24:37.240]  And then when I when it goes empty, I just go to target and buy a new one.
[24:37.320 --> 24:38.860]  A white canister can explode.
[24:39.080 --> 24:42.200]  I mean, if you ever shot a white barrel in a video game and had it explode.
[24:42.500 --> 24:43.140]  Propane tanks.
[24:44.820 --> 24:46.940]  Do propane tanks not explode if you shoot them?
[24:47.160 --> 24:48.160]  Oh, like Left 4 Dead?
[24:48.800 --> 24:49.860]  Yeah, they'll fire.
[24:49.980 --> 24:50.980]  They'll zoom off.
[24:51.120 --> 24:51.660]  Good point.
[24:52.440 --> 24:53.900]  Yeah, be really careful around it then.
[24:54.460 --> 24:57.800]  What's the most non-exploding color?
[24:58.080 --> 24:59.040]  Would you say blue?
[25:00.360 --> 25:02.940]  Blue, I think, is is like butane, though.
[25:03.440 --> 25:04.140]  Oh, it is?
[25:04.280 --> 25:05.120]  What about green?
[25:05.260 --> 25:05.940]  Does green explode?
[25:06.400 --> 25:07.620]  I don't think green explodes.
[25:08.320 --> 25:08.920]  Paint them green.
[25:10.200 --> 25:10.480]  Okay.
[25:11.200 --> 25:12.760]  Also, I don't think fire would shoot out.
[25:12.840 --> 25:14.320]  I think you have the opposite problem.
[25:15.080 --> 25:15.580]  Oh, really?
[25:16.080 --> 25:17.080]  Like it would freeze.
[25:17.740 --> 25:19.600]  Oh, green is like noxious gas.
[25:19.840 --> 25:20.840]  Yeah, you'll die.
[25:20.960 --> 25:21.400]  Can't do that.
[25:21.620 --> 25:21.960]  That's true.
[25:22.040 --> 25:23.400]  Yeah, the room would get all green.
[25:24.160 --> 25:24.960]  Maybe yellow.
[25:25.440 --> 25:25.840]  Yellow.
[25:25.840 --> 25:26.400]  Yellow?
[25:27.240 --> 25:31.900]  I got a lot of canisters because I bought compressed air because I noticed when I was
[25:31.900 --> 25:34.580]  playing trucks, my Xbox sounded like it was going to die.
[25:34.900 --> 25:39.620]  And I thought this could either be a trucks issue or something's going on my Xbox.
[25:39.780 --> 25:41.600]  In every game, it did the same thing.
[25:41.940 --> 25:44.540]  So I read that it's probably a dust problem.
[25:45.100 --> 25:49.820]  Let me tell you, if you haven't compressed air your Xbox, I'd highly recommend it.
[25:50.060 --> 25:53.880]  I could not believe the amount of dust that shot everywhere.
[25:53.880 --> 25:56.120]  I would say it was like a tomb.
[25:56.460 --> 26:00.780]  It was like we went into a tomb and opened something that had been buried for millions
[26:00.780 --> 26:01.340]  of years.
[26:01.520 --> 26:02.940]  Did you feel like Brendan Fraser?
[26:03.680 --> 26:04.280]  I did.
[26:04.640 --> 26:12.540]  Yeah, it kind of was like in Chernobyl, you know, when it's all the atomic ash coming
[26:12.540 --> 26:13.720]  down and they think it's snow.
[26:13.880 --> 26:15.360]  It was like that out of my Xbox.
[26:15.800 --> 26:17.960]  What kind of Xbox do you have?
[26:18.180 --> 26:19.520]  Xbox Series X.
[26:20.140 --> 26:20.900]  So like the big...
[26:20.900 --> 26:24.040]  The big, the like little fridge, the fridge one.
[26:24.400 --> 26:25.760]  Yeah, that's the one I have too.
[26:26.160 --> 26:30.180]  And so it was getting loud and then you compressed air and now it's fine?
[26:30.500 --> 26:36.280]  Yeah, it sounded like it was like a snowplow or like a heavy truck outside of where I live
[26:36.280 --> 26:38.520]  every time I tried to play any game on my Xbox.
[26:38.800 --> 26:43.100]  I was wondering why you had compressed air when you were unboxing your cock last week.
[26:43.140 --> 26:47.700]  It was because I cleaned out my Xbox with it and I would highly recommend it.
[26:47.980 --> 26:49.540]  So that's a good idea.
[26:50.160 --> 26:51.580]  Yeah, I should try that.
[26:52.000 --> 26:59.260]  I may or may not have just bought a whole new Xbox Series X because my Xbox is overheating.
[26:59.960 --> 27:00.440]  No!
[27:01.020 --> 27:02.900]  I wonder if I could have just blown it out.
[27:03.380 --> 27:04.480]  God, well, why don't you try?
[27:04.680 --> 27:05.980]  Why don't you try blowing it out?
[27:06.480 --> 27:07.920]  Here's what happened to my Xbox.
[27:08.100 --> 27:09.180]  Here's why I think it might be different.
[27:09.520 --> 27:14.280]  Emily always puts up like, you know, 40 billion Christmas decorations.
[27:14.280 --> 27:20.160]  And so the Xbox is on the, I don't know, on the console in front of the TV.
[27:20.780 --> 27:25.540]  And it always gets covered, like covered in holly and candles and all that shit.
[27:25.940 --> 27:29.680]  And at Christmas this year, for the first time ever, my Xbox started overheating.
[27:30.280 --> 27:32.520]  And it'll just like shut a game down and be like,
[27:32.600 --> 27:34.840]  it's the Xbox is running too hot to play this game right now.
[27:35.460 --> 27:36.880]  Reboot it and cool down and try again.
[27:37.100 --> 27:39.900]  And then so I made her take all that shit off.
[27:40.060 --> 27:43.740]  And then I stood it up because it had been laying down and it worked okay for a little while.
[27:43.740 --> 27:46.920]  But then it just started overheating in any game I play.
[27:47.060 --> 27:50.860]  Like I couldn't play more than two minutes on Power World and it would just turn my Xbox off.
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.900]  So I just fucking went out and bought a new one.
[27:53.020 --> 27:55.680]  But now I'm going to buy some canned air and see if I can return the new one.
[27:56.680 --> 27:58.940]  Yeah, and if you can't, give it to Eric or Nick.
[27:59.040 --> 28:00.580]  Because we're trying, we're slowly...
[28:00.580 --> 28:01.000]  I can do that.
[28:01.020 --> 28:01.900]  We're building for the Let's Play.
[28:02.420 --> 28:03.520]  I mean, I probably should give it to Millie.
[28:03.700 --> 28:04.720]  But yeah, I uh...
[28:04.720 --> 28:05.180]  Oh, yeah.
[28:05.500 --> 28:06.120]  Well, I mean, yeah.
[28:06.160 --> 28:09.260]  She's slightly, she's above you guys in the, in the hand-me-down thing.
[28:09.940 --> 28:10.280]  Understandable.
[28:10.620 --> 28:12.240]  How often do you vacuum your room, Andrew?
[28:14.260 --> 28:19.320]  Uh, not, uh, maybe like, I don't know, once a month, maybe?
[28:20.160 --> 28:21.420]  Oh, it's not as bad as I was expecting.
[28:21.420 --> 28:21.540]  Not a lot.
[28:21.920 --> 28:22.480]  Not a lot at all.
[28:24.120 --> 28:28.680]  Yeah, I was trying to come up with a number that sounded reasonable, but...
[28:28.680 --> 28:29.860]  Oh, so you're just making it up?
[28:30.260 --> 28:31.740]  Yeah, I just threw that number out there.
[28:31.880 --> 28:37.460]  Uh, it's probably been, uh, five months, six months since the last time I did it.
[28:37.600 --> 28:38.580]  Well, that could be your problem.
[28:40.880 --> 28:41.600]  Yeah, well...
[28:41.600 --> 28:46.040]  One footstep, you'd kick it up all the dust in the room and it's getting sucked in by your Xbox.
[28:46.840 --> 28:53.380]  Yeah, well, it definitely, it felt like there was 20 years worth of dust in this Xbox, so...
[28:53.380 --> 28:58.340]  And obviously with you stepping in Swiffer wet jet boxes, that's really gonna kick up the most.
[29:00.880 --> 29:05.200]  It did. It launched, my foot went into the Xbox area, so definitely
[29:05.200 --> 29:08.660]  kicked any additional dust into the vent thing.
[29:08.660 --> 29:11.860]  But you should definitely try it, Geoff, because it's a very holey system.
[29:12.260 --> 29:17.460]  There's a lot of holes you could shove that compressed air nozzle into, and it just flies.
[29:17.840 --> 29:20.020]  If I can save this Xbox, it'd be awesome to give it to Mel.
[29:21.480 --> 29:23.400]  Or one of you guys if she doesn't want it, but...
[29:24.540 --> 29:27.760]  I, uh, yeah, I think it, I justified it to myself because it was like,
[29:27.760 --> 29:32.160]  it was a free Xbox I got through work anyway, so I have never actually bought a Series X,
[29:32.360 --> 29:36.940]  so I figured, I've got enough free use out of this Xbox, I can afford to pay for one.
[29:37.500 --> 29:42.520]  Yeah, but I would still look at it, but still like to recoup the other Xbox and have it working.
[29:47.930 --> 29:51.830]  Good morning beverage enthusiasts, that's certainly me.
[29:52.010 --> 29:55.130]  There are all sorts of beverage enthusiasts, there are some people that like to stream,
[29:55.510 --> 30:01.590]  some people like, like all sorts of different beverages, but here we're talking about Kato's

[31:32.550 --> 31:36.350]  you think of the all-time greats and how important they were, like King and Peele,
[31:36.950 --> 31:44.310]  Geoff and Gavin, just endless combinations. Dave Chappelle and Neil Brennan did some amazing work.
[31:44.550 --> 31:49.490]  But what was so impactful about the relationship is one would set things up, the other would knock
[31:49.490 --> 31:54.690]  it out. And that's the perfect duo. And when it comes to growing your business, that's you and
[31:54.690 --> 32:01.990]  Shopify. Shopify is the global commerce platform that helps you sell at every stage of your

[32:55.050 --> 32:59.250]  you're starting. Starting a business, especially like an online store, absolutely terrifying.
[32:59.410 --> 33:03.690]  There's so much stuff to figure out and work through. It can feel overwhelming. But with
[33:03.690 --> 33:09.370]  Shopify as your perfect partner, it makes everything so much easier. It's just an all-around

[33:55.530 --> 33:59.610]  Ever tried to break a bad habit and felt like you're climbing Everest in flip-flops?
[33:59.790 --> 34:05.590]  Yeah, we've been there too. But here's a breath of fresh air. Fume is not about giving up. It's
[34:05.590 --> 34:11.190]  about switching up. Fume takes your habit and simply makes it better, healthier, and a whole
[34:11.190 --> 34:16.210]  lot more enjoyable. Fume is an innovative, award-winning flavored air device that does
[34:16.210 --> 34:21.410]  just that. Instead of vapor, fume uses flavored air. Instead of electronics,
[34:21.850 --> 34:27.370]  fume is completely natural. And instead of harmful chemicals, fume uses delicious flavors.
[34:27.890 --> 34:32.710]  You get it. Instead of bad, fume is good. It's a habit you're free to enjoy
[34:32.710 --> 34:37.770]  and makes replacing your bad habit easy. Your fume comes with an adjustable airflow dial
[34:37.770 --> 34:43.110]  and is designed with movable parts and magnets for fidgeting, giving your fingers a lot to do,
[34:43.110 --> 34:47.470]  which is helpful for de-stressing and anxiety while breaking your habit.
[34:47.810 --> 34:52.410]  Something I was immediately struck by with the fume is how good it feels. It's weighted perfectly.
[34:52.990 --> 34:57.250]  It's balanced. And it's just extremely fun to fidget with. So if it's something that
[34:57.250 --> 35:01.370]  you're just maybe anxious or just want to fidget with something, it's perfect for that.
[35:01.690 --> 35:04.650]  It also looks beautiful. The real wood and the shape of it,
[35:04.710 --> 35:10.270]  it's something that you can feel cool using. It's just a beautiful looking thing. Plus,
[35:10.270 --> 35:15.230]  fume's just released a magnetic stand for your fume, so there's no more losing it around the
[35:15.230 --> 35:19.810]  house. It's built with fidgeting in mind. You can spin your fume around on it.
[35:20.610 --> 35:26.430]  Start the year off right with the good habit by going to tryfume.com slash face and getting the

[35:43.890 --> 35:46.950]  Do you want to hear a disturbing discovery I made recently?
[35:47.510 --> 35:50.670]  Please. What do you know about blimps?
[35:51.210 --> 35:55.370]  They're incredibly dangerous. Yeah, they explode. They were supposed to
[35:55.370 --> 36:02.390]  be the future of travel, right, at one point? Do you know how many blimps there are in the world?
[36:02.990 --> 36:05.350]  We got the Goodyear blimp. I'm going to say three.
[36:07.330 --> 36:11.470]  I'm going to say one. I think it's just the Goodyear blimp at this point.
[36:11.490 --> 36:13.790]  You think there's one blimp? I think it's just the Goodyear blimp.
[36:13.790 --> 36:15.730]  No, there's got to be a backup. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:16.150 --> 36:20.370]  I say three. Oh, okay. Well, maybe my fact wouldn't be
[36:20.370 --> 36:25.610]  very mind-blowing to you. There's 25. That's a lot.
[36:26.130 --> 36:29.150]  Yeah, that's a lot. I think that's such a low amount.
[36:30.450 --> 36:33.850]  No, I mean, I picked three because I could tell where you were going with this. But yeah,
[36:33.850 --> 36:37.890]  it does seem like, I mean, they're not practical in any way, right?
[36:38.210 --> 36:39.810]  No. I thought they were just above every,
[36:39.830 --> 36:42.510]  like, sporting event. That's what I was going to say.
[36:42.990 --> 36:47.590]  Like, why are we using them at football games? If there's only 25, we should be using them very
[36:47.590 --> 36:51.590]  sparingly for whatever their intended purpose is. Football games.
[36:51.770 --> 36:54.590]  That means all blimps are limited edition. Yeah.
[36:55.090 --> 36:57.590]  Yeah. I don't know. I feel like I've never seen a blimp,
[36:57.910 --> 37:00.310]  so it just didn't feel like a thing that was in circulation.
[37:00.690 --> 37:03.310]  I feel like blimping is a dead technology.
[37:03.930 --> 37:05.570]  Yeah. Oh, it definitely is.
[37:06.430 --> 37:10.050]  They got a GTA online though. We used to fuck with blimps in GTA online.
[37:10.510 --> 37:14.470]  I've shot that blimp down more times than there are actually blimps.
[37:18.050 --> 37:20.810]  Well, you think about it, like, is there a blimp company?
[37:21.470 --> 37:24.690]  Like, yeah, that's a great question. Apparently one company owns, like,
[37:24.730 --> 37:29.490]  all the main blimps, like the Goodyear and the DirecTV and it's all one company.
[37:30.170 --> 37:31.950]  How much does it cost to buy a blimp?
[37:33.030 --> 37:33.930]  That's what I'm wondering.
[37:34.690 --> 37:39.110]  Or are you basically leasing the blimp out from that company?
[37:39.530 --> 37:42.570]  You got to make sure that you get your loan from the bank
[37:42.570 --> 37:46.630]  and not at the blimp dealership is the move because they'll jack your interest.
[37:47.070 --> 37:48.390]  Dude, you know what I'm thinking here?
[37:48.530 --> 37:49.250]  The Unifon blimp?
[37:49.470 --> 37:52.950]  Yeah. Blimping is old technology, right? They had that shit. That's what the Hindenburg was.
[37:53.310 --> 37:56.970]  Like, that shit's been around for 100 years. Clearly not hard. You just need fabric and air.
[37:56.970 --> 38:04.190]  So what if we started a competing blimp company and then we just undercut their prices by 10%?
[38:04.790 --> 38:06.770]  Instantly, we're fucking... we're blimp rich.
[38:06.990 --> 38:10.710]  What do you think will be cheaper, doing that or just buying the shittiest blimp?
[38:10.890 --> 38:13.290]  Like, the 25th most sought after blimp.
[38:13.910 --> 38:16.930]  But they... but if they own it, they own the means.
[38:17.050 --> 38:17.290]  Oh, God.
[38:17.310 --> 38:18.930]  They're going to fucking overcharge you.
[38:19.250 --> 38:20.770]  How much can... how much is it?
[38:21.290 --> 38:22.250]  I don't know.
[38:22.690 --> 38:23.910]  Let me look up blimp for sale.
[38:24.470 --> 38:30.190]  Would you rather take one of those submarines down to the Titanic or ride in the shittiest blimp?
[38:30.430 --> 38:32.690]  I would ride the blimp. If, you know, worst comes to worst,
[38:32.730 --> 38:34.910]  I'd dive out the window and parachute to safety.
[38:35.230 --> 38:36.910]  Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay.
[38:37.510 --> 38:41.570]  It's a better escape plan than being a mile below the surface of the ocean.
[38:41.790 --> 38:42.310]  What are you going to do there?
[38:42.390 --> 38:47.510]  Yeah, but I... clearly in the hypothetical, the question wasn't phrased in the scenario
[38:47.510 --> 38:52.130]  in which you have a parachute and are able to jump out. It's just trapped vehicles.
[38:52.590 --> 38:53.350]  Oh, uh...
[38:53.350 --> 38:54.670]  I don't know if I trust them.
[38:54.970 --> 38:55.950]  Oh, boy.
[38:57.350 --> 38:58.330]  Oh, boy.
[38:58.510 --> 39:01.130]  So we can buy a blimp, and they're not that expensive.
[39:03.090 --> 39:04.090]  They're smaller.
[39:04.910 --> 39:09.190]  We're talking about Airship Solutions, who sells the world's smallest blimps.
[39:09.750 --> 39:12.670]  You can get the indoor-outdoor model for $7,000.
[39:13.070 --> 39:16.330]  It's the E-13 blimp with the indoor and outdoor gondola.
[39:16.790 --> 39:21.170]  Fins with a choice color of 40 to choose from for both indoor and outdoor.
[39:21.170 --> 39:24.610]  It's got a hole with three standard colors or a combination of three standard colors.
[39:24.750 --> 39:27.550]  Any PMS can be matched for non-standard at a cost.
[39:28.590 --> 39:31.750]  ACDC digital battery charger, hole repair kit.
[39:32.150 --> 39:33.990]  These are tiny little handheld blimps.
[39:34.230 --> 39:36.950]  They're still... they're as big as a person.
[39:37.510 --> 39:38.050]  You gotta start somewhere.
[39:38.530 --> 39:40.690]  You gotta be able to drive the blimp from the inside.
[39:43.330 --> 39:45.790]  You gotta start somewhere.
[39:46.010 --> 39:47.570]  The cheapest inner blimp.
[39:47.570 --> 39:53.710]  We roll up to fucking local sporting events, we start blimping around at halftime,
[39:53.970 --> 39:57.590]  take all the money we have, put it into R&D, and we make a bigger blimp.
[39:57.750 --> 39:59.970]  And then we go to... we tackle bigger clients.
[40:00.190 --> 40:03.370]  And we keep working our way up until suddenly we've got a fucking...
[40:03.370 --> 40:05.170]  we've got like the world's biggest blimp.
[40:05.750 --> 40:09.130]  We'd need a pair of binoculars on every seat for this blimp to work.
[40:09.650 --> 40:10.730]  It's not that small.
[40:11.090 --> 40:13.430]  There's a picture of it at a fucking sporting event.
[40:14.290 --> 40:15.090]  Yeah, but it's...
[40:16.570 --> 40:17.010]  Okay.
[40:17.010 --> 40:19.650]  Are these like the ones that would drop stuff?
[40:19.830 --> 40:20.990]  That's not that small.
[40:21.690 --> 40:23.410]  Yeah, they're pretty small.
[40:23.530 --> 40:26.650]  They drop like shirts and stuff as they fly around.
[40:26.890 --> 40:29.530]  Gotta be... it's gotta be 10 feet long at least.
[40:30.650 --> 40:32.090]  I don't know about that.
[40:32.190 --> 40:34.050]  You gotta start somewhere.
[40:35.310 --> 40:38.330]  Does it just say imagine this but bigger on the side for us?
[40:38.450 --> 40:38.930]  Like what is...
[40:38.930 --> 40:41.590]  Look, Andrew, how big... like there it is right there next to two dudes.
[40:41.590 --> 40:42.310]  That's pretty big.
[40:42.370 --> 40:44.170]  That's clearly bigger than those dudes.
[40:44.830 --> 40:46.230]  What if on the side we just write
[40:46.230 --> 40:49.530]  help us buy a bigger blimp and then there's a QR code and people can...
[40:50.370 --> 40:51.290]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[40:51.290 --> 40:51.930]  Donate to the blimp fund.
[40:52.350 --> 40:53.610]  The International Blimp Fund.
[40:53.990 --> 40:55.090]  Make this blimp bigger.
[40:55.530 --> 40:56.930]  So wait, hang on.
[40:57.130 --> 41:00.470]  So in order to get the blimp going, you said we need all these
[41:00.470 --> 41:04.990]  binoculars for people to see our tiny blimp, but you want to put a QR code on the side
[41:04.990 --> 41:08.990]  so everyone has to zoom in all the way through binoculars.
[41:09.630 --> 41:14.110]  I just think that the initial steps there are gonna be very tough.
[41:14.630 --> 41:15.690]  I can tie this full circle.
[41:15.690 --> 41:17.570]  You said Uniform is all about innovation.
[41:17.770 --> 41:20.590]  We sell binoculars that can scan QR codes.
[41:20.650 --> 41:23.590]  There you go, Andrew, there you go.
[41:23.890 --> 41:28.330]  That's honestly, that's a CES technology that I'm surprised isn't a thing already.
[41:29.430 --> 41:30.450]  Sounds like a...
[41:30.450 --> 41:31.450]  It solves your problem.
[41:32.150 --> 41:36.210]  Sounds like a knockoff Mr. Beast video where we leave like an unclaimed Venmo
[41:36.210 --> 41:39.430]  wallet on a QR code, but put it on a really high up balloon.
[41:41.350 --> 41:43.290]  First to scan it gets the money.
[41:43.850 --> 41:44.990]  There's also a great...
[41:45.430 --> 41:46.030]  Oh my god!
[41:46.730 --> 41:47.570]  What do you find?
[41:49.230 --> 41:54.590]  The Swarovski Optic Outdoor app allows you to transfer cell phone and
[41:56.290 --> 42:02.110]  transfer data from your binoculars to your cell phone.
[42:02.350 --> 42:04.830]  The live view feature, turn the mode selection wheel,
[42:05.270 --> 42:09.730]  makes it possible to share the view with up to four other smartphones and use QR codes.
[42:09.830 --> 42:10.950]  It might already exist.
[42:11.230 --> 42:11.450]  Damn.
[42:11.830 --> 42:12.110]  Shit.
[42:12.110 --> 42:13.230]  I thought I was being innovative.
[42:13.790 --> 42:15.490]  There is a great...
[42:15.490 --> 42:19.690]  There's a great It's Always Sunny style edit for this episode of Geoff saying
[42:19.690 --> 42:22.270]  Unifarm isn't about just slapping their logo on things
[42:22.270 --> 42:24.850]  and then immediately cutting to fuckface buys a blimp.
[42:27.550 --> 42:29.210]  Literally the only purpose of the blimp.
[42:29.210 --> 42:30.770]  The only thing you can do with a blimp.
[42:30.970 --> 42:32.610]  Yes, you slap your logo on it.
[42:32.650 --> 42:34.350]  Oh, it sounds like we can drop t-shirts from it.
[42:35.050 --> 42:36.370]  Oh yeah, you can do that too.
[42:36.590 --> 42:38.630]  Did you... Have you never experienced that in a sporting event?
[42:38.670 --> 42:40.670]  Like the little blimp that flies around and drops shit?
[42:40.670 --> 42:43.410]  Except our blimp will drop a bunch of toothpaste keys.
[42:44.250 --> 42:45.450]  And bread clips.
[42:47.250 --> 42:48.570]  And wrist pockets.
[42:50.930 --> 42:54.590]  They spend all of their entertainment budget on the blimp,
[42:54.730 --> 42:58.430]  so it's just them dropping bread clips on people is the priciest.
[42:59.170 --> 43:00.210]  Oh my god.
[43:03.710 --> 43:05.090]  25 blimps, huh?
[43:05.630 --> 43:08.690]  Yeah, 25 sort of sizable drivable blimps is what I've read.
[43:08.690 --> 43:11.750]  But that also could be horseshit because it was on Wikipedia.
[43:12.890 --> 43:15.390]  I believe it. I got a whole podcast based off Wikipedia.
[43:15.570 --> 43:16.670]  Don't start talking shit about Wikipedia.
[43:17.010 --> 43:17.410]  Okay.
[43:18.530 --> 43:22.290]  I thought I would tune into something over the last week.
[43:22.490 --> 43:24.470]  Something that I've heard about a few times but never watched.
[43:25.010 --> 43:28.850]  It was Eric doing the wrestling commentary.
[43:29.530 --> 43:31.010]  Oh, it's great, isn't it?
[43:32.210 --> 43:35.550]  I went into it not knowing how Eric was going to approach it.
[43:35.650 --> 43:38.330]  Like, is he going to be softly spoken and technical?
[43:39.350 --> 43:40.410]  I tuned in.
[43:40.670 --> 43:41.830]  That's insane.
[43:42.510 --> 43:44.890]  That's an insane way to think I would approach anything, but thank you.
[43:45.030 --> 43:47.510]  That is... also, Gavin has never seen wrestling.
[43:47.710 --> 43:48.390]  Like, what are you...
[43:48.390 --> 43:50.150]  Well, I know there's always like a screaming guy,
[43:50.490 --> 43:53.810]  but I think, I guess, when I watched WWF, it was like two screaming guys.
[43:54.290 --> 43:55.770]  But yeah, I just... I'd never heard it.
[43:55.890 --> 43:57.510]  So I was just... I didn't really know what to expect.
[43:58.010 --> 44:02.670]  I tuned in on Twitch and was met with some guy, like,
[44:03.190 --> 44:04.930]  pelvic thrusting another guy in the ass.
[44:04.930 --> 44:05.350]  Oh!
[44:06.610 --> 44:08.490]  And then Eric go... I just hear Eric go,
[44:09.070 --> 44:09.430]  Oh!
[44:12.450 --> 44:17.490]  Yeah, you know, it's a cast of characters and everyone has their different psychology
[44:17.490 --> 44:19.690]  and the way they approach their matches.
[44:20.150 --> 44:21.490]  And so what Gavin tuned into...
[44:22.270 --> 44:24.390]  It's the most animated I've ever seen you in my life.
[44:25.630 --> 44:28.470]  It's, uh, you know, it's a lot of fun.
[44:28.630 --> 44:33.090]  It's great doing all of the pro wrestling stuff,
[44:33.090 --> 44:36.990]  because all these... some of these guys, their goal is to be like,
[44:37.730 --> 44:41.290]  you know, like where I'm going to get on TV and I want to do this as a career.
[44:41.550 --> 44:44.490]  And then there are other people that are like weekend warriors about it.
[44:44.510 --> 44:46.230]  And the weekend warrior guys are the best ones.
[44:46.810 --> 44:49.090]  Yeah, I feel like I saw some stuff that couldn't be on TV.
[44:49.450 --> 44:50.710]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:50.770 --> 44:52.450]  Did you get taken to Pound Town?
[44:52.970 --> 44:53.890]  Did you see a Pound Town?
[44:54.610 --> 44:58.450]  No, he has not seen the mayor of Pound Town yet.
[44:59.590 --> 45:02.270]  That's maybe my favorite guy.
[45:02.270 --> 45:08.110]  He is... what a funny comedy guy just to do... just to get beat up.
[45:08.230 --> 45:11.170]  He goes in and he tells people I'm going to take you to Pound Town
[45:11.170 --> 45:13.790]  and then he just gets punched or thrown over the top rope.
[45:14.030 --> 45:16.310]  It's perfect. It's perfect every time. It's great.
[45:16.570 --> 45:20.710]  But Gavin, I can't... like you tuned in and I got a text from you in the middle of it
[45:20.710 --> 45:21.890]  and I went, oh, that's crazy.
[45:22.970 --> 45:24.030]  I could not believe that you are watching it.
[45:24.290 --> 45:26.190]  And I just wrote, I feel like I'm watching a hate crime.
[45:26.610 --> 45:26.770]  Yeah.
[45:30.030 --> 45:31.910]  Do you just do the commentary from home?
[45:32.590 --> 45:33.510]  No, no, no, no.
[45:33.590 --> 45:33.990]  You go there?
[45:34.490 --> 45:36.570]  Yeah, I go to the arena. We have like a little setup.
[45:37.010 --> 45:42.410]  The producer that put it together did a really great job.
[45:42.470 --> 45:46.750]  He has like an ATEM multicam setup and it's like a whole thing.
[45:46.890 --> 45:49.690]  Yeah, it's fucking crazy. And it's like it's on zero dollars.
[45:49.930 --> 45:52.690]  So it's a lot of fun. And we do it like every Saturday.
[45:52.790 --> 45:54.390]  It's always a great time. I really enjoy it.
[45:54.390 --> 45:54.530]  Thank you for tuning in.
[45:54.530 --> 45:55.350]  People should definitely watch it.
[45:55.350 --> 45:58.090]  Yeah, it's great. Every time I've watched it.
[45:58.290 --> 46:00.950]  Official AAPW is where you can find us all over the place.
[46:01.130 --> 46:01.390]  Cool.
[46:01.630 --> 46:03.510]  You want to do it, Gavin? You want to get in there?
[46:04.770 --> 46:05.130]  No.
[46:06.490 --> 46:07.390]  Do you want?
[46:07.470 --> 46:08.630]  I'll film some slow-mo though.
[46:09.170 --> 46:10.710]  Yeah, you want to film some slow-mo of like,
[46:10.830 --> 46:13.190]  maybe Dan gets thrown around or somebody doing something?
[46:13.390 --> 46:13.810]  Yeah, why not?
[46:14.490 --> 46:18.370]  I had a really weird thought pop into my head that I just remembered,
[46:18.890 --> 46:21.210]  Gavin, last night that I wanted to ask you.
[46:21.430 --> 46:23.970]  This is a very strange question, but it was making me laugh.
[46:23.970 --> 46:26.110]  I was having a great time.
[46:26.390 --> 46:33.910]  Have you ever filmed like an elderly man sprinting at you naked in slow motion?
[46:34.630 --> 46:35.090]  No.
[46:35.990 --> 46:37.790]  Yeah, have you ever filmed that, dude?
[46:38.750 --> 46:41.090]  No. You know what? No, I haven't.
[46:41.330 --> 46:42.830]  Because I think it would be really funny.
[46:43.130 --> 46:44.850]  I think that'd be a really great slow-mo.
[46:45.810 --> 46:45.950]  Why?
[46:46.490 --> 46:49.630]  Because the skin is kind of loose and you don't really see
[46:49.630 --> 46:52.150]  people of a certain age sprint anymore.
[46:52.150 --> 46:55.450]  I just think there's a lot of flopping that's going to happen,
[46:55.650 --> 46:57.350]  and I think it would be really funny.
[46:57.710 --> 47:01.230]  It's so simple, but I'd just love to see a naked old dude
[47:01.230 --> 47:03.990]  sprinting towards the camera at you from a distance.
[47:04.430 --> 47:06.250]  A. Who's going to want to be filmed that way?
[47:06.370 --> 47:08.230]  And B. Where are we going to put that?
[47:09.290 --> 47:10.090]  A. Nudists.
[47:10.410 --> 47:12.190]  B. Great question.
[47:12.390 --> 47:13.890]  But we'll figure that out later.
[47:16.410 --> 47:19.630]  The biggest problem is getting the old guy, but I don't think that's hard.
[47:19.770 --> 47:21.810]  I'm sure it's not going to be hard at all, dude.
[47:22.470 --> 47:25.530]  Yeah, a naked old guy, that's the easiest part.
[47:25.730 --> 47:28.430]  You can't tell me it doesn't crack you up just imagining all the
[47:28.430 --> 47:32.450]  seeing it in slow motion, all the bops and the things bouncing around.
[47:32.750 --> 47:34.510]  See, I've been in this situation before, though.
[47:34.570 --> 47:37.430]  It's like the idea of it's funny and it's great.
[47:37.670 --> 47:39.130]  And it's like, oh, I'm so excited to do that.
[47:39.190 --> 47:43.150]  And then you're watching the footage and you're just like, oh, no, I don't think
[47:43.150 --> 47:46.710]  I think you would be laughing so hard as if they were into it.
[47:46.710 --> 47:49.050]  If they got the spirit of it, I think that's hilarious.
[47:49.670 --> 47:51.650]  I think I think you should direct this piece.
[47:52.330 --> 47:53.290]  Yeah, I would.
[47:53.510 --> 47:54.130]  I mean, it's easy.
[47:54.230 --> 47:56.450]  I don't think I think Geoff could even direct this piece.
[47:56.750 --> 47:57.430]  I think he gets.
[47:57.430 --> 47:58.430]  What the fuck is that?
[48:01.070 --> 48:02.710]  How did Geoff get?
[48:02.850 --> 48:03.770]  What happened?
[48:03.950 --> 48:06.330]  Geoff gets hit by the strayest bull somehow.
[48:06.830 --> 48:09.590]  No, I mean, that's the Gavin.
[48:09.750 --> 48:11.970]  I'm probably I got to be the best director in this group.
[48:12.070 --> 48:12.770]  What the hell?
[48:13.670 --> 48:15.530]  No, this is what I meant by that.
[48:15.590 --> 48:18.610]  It feels to me like this would be a very jackass thing.
[48:18.630 --> 48:22.050]  And I think you completely understand the spirit of something that is jackass.
[48:22.050 --> 48:24.130]  I think you'd be absolutely capable of.
[48:24.510 --> 48:26.190]  Dumbest, shittiest motherfucker I know.
[48:29.090 --> 48:32.990]  I love it was Gavin going, Andrew, I'm going to make you watch this.
[48:33.050 --> 48:35.530]  And Andrew going, yeah, Geoff should have to watch this.
[48:35.750 --> 48:40.990]  Yeah. Also, Gavin, didn't you tell me once that you filmed for a commercial
[48:41.910 --> 48:47.130]  like Sienna Miller or some famous actress run or like a music video running naked?
[48:47.270 --> 48:50.890]  And you said seeing anybody run naked in slow motion was one of the most
[48:50.890 --> 48:52.190]  disturbing things you'd ever seen.
[48:53.170 --> 48:56.290]  It's not flattering that the Sienna Miller thing was that was a different thing.
[48:56.370 --> 48:59.430]  That was when I've never been booed so much in my entire life.
[48:59.670 --> 49:07.010]  But what we're filming some music video and she was in like a gown, like hospital overalls
[49:07.010 --> 49:10.330]  and did like a little lunge over some gurneys or something.
[49:10.530 --> 49:15.350]  But that was just like a hell of a view up her up her gown.
[49:15.510 --> 49:16.510]  And we're all watching it.
[49:16.670 --> 49:18.070]  We're all watching it slowed down.
[49:18.070 --> 49:21.750]  And I was like, oh, this is going to be it's going to be pretty bad for her
[49:21.750 --> 49:23.530]  because it'll be just dudes on set.
[49:23.670 --> 49:27.330]  So I skipped ahead past that bit and everyone yelled at me.
[49:28.570 --> 49:29.770]  You did the right thing.
[49:30.050 --> 49:32.110]  It sounds like you definitely did the right thing.
[49:32.310 --> 49:35.410]  Of course I did the right thing, but it was it was a room full of
[49:35.850 --> 49:39.370]  50 year old blokes who almost saw Sienna Miller's growler.
[49:39.530 --> 49:42.090]  So they were really, really pissed off.
[49:42.490 --> 49:43.270]  And when was this?
[49:45.470 --> 49:46.650]  15 years ago, maybe.
[49:46.650 --> 49:50.190]  See, now one of those guys can be our naked old man sprinting.
[49:50.450 --> 49:55.410]  All I took away from that story when you told me 15 years ago was that
[49:55.410 --> 49:58.050]  even the hottest people on Earth are ugly when they run.
[49:58.410 --> 49:59.850]  And I was like, I just remember that.
[49:59.950 --> 50:01.470]  No, she wasn't. She looked great.
[50:02.190 --> 50:03.490]  Yeah, but she wasn't naked.
[50:03.590 --> 50:04.210]  She was wearing a gown.
[50:05.190 --> 50:07.030]  I'm just saying, I just think about it.
[50:07.110 --> 50:08.370]  I'm not. Listen, you do.
[50:08.470 --> 50:10.970]  You control the Slow Mo Guys channel however you want.
[50:11.270 --> 50:12.650]  But it's just something to consider.
[50:13.130 --> 50:15.810]  If you say it's educational, you can put it up on YouTube with nudity.
[50:15.810 --> 50:16.730]  That's true.
[50:17.430 --> 50:19.690]  What, so he should write some like algebra on his chest or something?
[50:22.530 --> 50:24.130]  I was just thinking the flops.
[50:24.550 --> 50:27.890]  I was snickering to myself just how floppy everything would be.
[50:28.030 --> 50:29.650]  Because they have to be kind of out of shape too.
[50:29.950 --> 50:34.690]  A kind of out of shape 70 year old man sprinting with intent right at the camera.
[50:35.250 --> 50:36.370]  Would you do it when you're 70?
[50:37.150 --> 50:37.430]  What?
[50:39.570 --> 50:41.170]  Like if you were 70, would you go for it?
[50:41.690 --> 50:43.230]  Oh, hell yeah. Absolutely, I would.
[50:43.730 --> 50:44.390]  Mark it down.
[50:44.390 --> 50:46.310]  Yeah, okay, sure. I'll sign up for this.
[50:46.530 --> 50:48.510]  We'll revisit this in 40 years or whatever.
[50:48.990 --> 50:50.610]  Yeah, like 40 years.
[50:51.070 --> 50:52.170]  Put in your calendar, Gavin.
[50:53.870 --> 50:54.750]  20... 64?
[50:56.430 --> 50:59.090]  And I don't want to tip anything off here,
[50:59.210 --> 51:01.470]  but you might want to be a first member for that one.
[51:01.690 --> 51:02.730]  That's going to be on my pay.
[51:05.350 --> 51:07.370]  Get your subscription now.
[51:12.110 --> 51:16.530]  Mark that subscription now because in 40 years, you're going to want to be ready.
[51:16.910 --> 51:18.070]  We're bringing the content.
[51:18.410 --> 51:19.170]  Jesus Christ.
[51:19.750 --> 51:26.150]  It would be fun to set up a video like that, that time releases in 40 years.
[51:26.430 --> 51:32.710]  And it's kind of like how Mark Twain, when he died, wrote an autobiography,
[51:32.790 --> 51:35.630]  but it said it couldn't be released until after 100 years after he was dead or something.
[51:37.370 --> 51:39.770]  I think I think something similar happened to J.D. Salinger,
[51:39.870 --> 51:41.790]  where he wrote like an additional three or four novels and then said
[51:41.790 --> 51:43.290]  that they could only be released after he died.
[51:43.670 --> 51:48.130]  That'd be funny if we made a video and then just set the time release as far as possible out.
[51:48.190 --> 51:50.970]  And just like 30 years from now, it just clicks on.
[51:51.510 --> 51:53.730]  That's what made me come up with that thought.
[51:54.090 --> 51:57.650]  And you saying that made me remember it was because Robert Rodriguez
[51:57.650 --> 52:01.210]  made a alcohol short documentary with John Malkovich
[52:01.210 --> 52:04.730]  that isn't supposed to come out until like 2070 something.
[52:04.930 --> 52:06.010]  Oh, and really?
[52:06.010 --> 52:09.610]  Like it's just yeah, it's slated and it's like essentially the idea of being like
[52:09.610 --> 52:13.330]  everybody's going to be dead by the time that that worked on this by the time it releases.
[52:13.690 --> 52:16.590]  And I just in my head, I could see John Malkovich doing some
[52:16.590 --> 52:18.530]  creepy, weird shit that you don't like.
[52:18.810 --> 52:22.510]  Everyone's waiting for this film, and then it just turned out to be John Malkovich
[52:22.510 --> 52:27.610]  goateeing for 30 seconds laughing at you that people are waiting for out of this vault.
[52:28.170 --> 52:32.190]  Just John Malkovich admitting to like multiple murders across the world.
[52:32.550 --> 52:34.070]  Yeah, it's like the jinx.
[52:36.110 --> 52:39.030]  He's just burping and admitting to killing people.
[52:40.410 --> 52:43.310]  We thought it was a truck driver. It was John Malkovich the whole time.
[52:43.390 --> 52:44.530]  He's the smiley face killer.
[52:45.070 --> 52:45.950]  What was up with the burping?
[52:46.410 --> 52:48.070]  He just fucking is involuntary.
[52:48.790 --> 52:50.730]  Just like a fucking guilty tick.
[52:51.430 --> 52:51.890]  I think.
[52:52.410 --> 52:53.170]  Now he's dead.
[52:53.830 --> 52:56.830]  Oh, I have a clip.
[52:57.930 --> 52:59.090]  Oh, what's your clip?
[52:59.490 --> 53:02.330]  It's from episode 191 of one of the ad reads.
[53:02.950 --> 53:03.730]  Oh, fuck off.
[53:04.390 --> 53:05.090]  Fuck off.
[53:05.870 --> 53:06.970]  Eat my dick.
[53:07.730 --> 53:09.910]  Respectfully, you go do an ad read.
[53:10.750 --> 53:12.310]  I'm gonna have to put my therapy hat back on.
[53:12.490 --> 53:13.910]  This thing is getting a little spicy.
[53:14.150 --> 53:15.710]  Why don't you do the ads this week, Gavin?
[53:15.890 --> 53:16.810]  And here we go.
[53:17.130 --> 53:19.430]  Great programs for and it's really easy to pick up.
[53:19.710 --> 53:24.290]  The other thing that they do, which is so awesome, is they provide pronunciation checks.
[53:27.530 --> 53:28.570]  Of all the words.
[53:29.890 --> 53:30.190]  Yeah.
[53:37.510 --> 53:39.430]  Yeah, that's how I came out aggressive.
[53:46.250 --> 53:48.650]  That was so fucking funny.
[53:53.570 --> 53:55.030]  I knew it was coming.
[53:58.430 --> 54:00.270]  Oh, God damn.
[54:00.410 --> 54:04.450]  Did you know you did that in the moment and then thought, ah, fuck it, nobody will notice?
[54:04.450 --> 54:05.630]  Or did you find out?
[54:05.870 --> 54:08.610]  It was a thing where I was, if I'm going to be completely honest,
[54:08.790 --> 54:12.750]  I was in the midst of a payday heist while recording that ad read.
[54:13.210 --> 54:16.050]  And I fumbled it.
[54:16.450 --> 54:21.390]  I was trying to pick safety deposit boxes and I fumbled it.
[54:21.850 --> 54:23.850]  Wait, wait.
[54:23.970 --> 54:26.310]  Was this during our payday heist?
[54:26.650 --> 54:29.610]  No, I played some payday by myself later.
[54:29.810 --> 54:30.930]  We would have heard him if it was on.
[54:31.290 --> 54:32.310]  That's what I thought, too.
[54:32.310 --> 54:33.090]  I was trying to think.
[54:33.170 --> 54:36.910]  I'm like, was there any point where Andrew was muted for like a long time?
[54:37.330 --> 54:39.710]  Maybe that's how he should do all of his.
[54:40.010 --> 54:41.250]  Andrew, you should do all your ad reads.
[54:41.350 --> 54:44.130]  Next one should be in the middle of the final circle of warzone.
[54:45.550 --> 54:46.790]  OK, how many?
[54:47.650 --> 54:48.450]  How many?
[54:50.430 --> 54:52.210]  How many players is Payday 3?
[54:53.070 --> 54:53.390]  Four.
[54:53.750 --> 54:54.370]  Four players.
[54:54.810 --> 54:57.370]  Yeah, we talked about it last time.
[54:57.490 --> 54:59.430]  We had like a lot of fun when we played payday.
[54:59.470 --> 55:00.430]  Those videos will come out eventually.
[55:00.690 --> 55:01.470]  We had a lot of fun.
[55:01.470 --> 55:05.450]  We talked about, you know, if there's a world where, you know, we have our four,
[55:05.630 --> 55:10.230]  but then maybe people get swapped in and out for, I don't know,
[55:10.250 --> 55:16.550]  about lowest performing member of the group or people that blow it.
[55:17.610 --> 55:23.650]  So what we're saying is there is a group of four for payday, which I'm not in.
[55:23.790 --> 55:24.350]  I understand.
[55:24.490 --> 55:25.830]  I didn't make that recording, so that's fine.
[55:25.890 --> 55:26.370]  That's fair to me.
[55:26.410 --> 55:27.570]  There's always different groups, right?
[55:28.110 --> 55:29.150]  That's how this kind of works.
[55:29.150 --> 55:31.610]  There's a group of four for payday.
[55:31.750 --> 55:36.270]  However, there's a potential system in play where the lowest performing member
[55:36.270 --> 55:38.910]  gets relegated for a video and replaced.
[55:39.470 --> 55:41.370]  Just saying, just a potential.
[55:41.890 --> 55:43.470]  Who do you think could have been chucked?
[55:43.770 --> 55:44.430]  Oh, boy.
[55:45.370 --> 55:50.290]  You know, honestly, I'm going to leave it to the videos that come out.
[55:50.490 --> 55:53.670]  You guys let us know when the payday videos come out.
[55:54.250 --> 55:55.390]  Leave a comment.
[55:55.390 --> 55:59.830]  Let us know who you think would be relegated of the group of four.
[55:59.970 --> 56:02.290]  I'm very curious to see what the chat says.
[56:03.590 --> 56:04.930]  I can't wait to find out.
[56:06.150 --> 56:09.850]  I think that could even work outside of because we're just sort of going through,
[56:10.010 --> 56:11.490]  like we do a heist onto the next one.
[56:11.910 --> 56:14.430]  I think it'd be a lot of fun for us to try to perfect every heist.
[56:14.490 --> 56:18.410]  And maybe like while we're doing those runs, factor in who fails the most.
[56:18.550 --> 56:21.610]  And then whoever fails the most is cut from the crew for the next night
[56:21.610 --> 56:24.410]  because you wouldn't bring that guy back if this was a real heist group.
[56:24.410 --> 56:25.630]  And they have to do the ad read.
[56:25.930 --> 56:26.310]  That's true.
[56:26.470 --> 56:27.910]  And they have to do the ad read.
[56:28.170 --> 56:30.350]  I will say Payday 2 was a great game,
[56:30.410 --> 56:32.810]  and we got a lot of really good content out of it for Achievement Hunter.
[56:32.890 --> 56:37.350]  So I think it probably stands to reason that three would warrant a few videos as well,
[56:37.470 --> 56:38.690]  especially if you guys are having fun playing it.
[56:38.790 --> 56:41.350]  Oh, it's so much fun. I can't believe how much fun I had.
[56:41.510 --> 56:43.490]  I cannot believe how much fun I had playing that game.
[56:43.690 --> 56:45.490]  I feel like we have too much to play.
[56:45.610 --> 56:47.990]  Like I really, really, really want to play Pal World.
[56:48.130 --> 56:49.270]  I think there'd be a couple of videos.
[56:49.630 --> 56:52.490]  I think trucks could be just based on the audience alone.
[56:52.490 --> 56:55.370]  I think trucks could be endless videos, it feels like.
[56:55.370 --> 57:00.370]  I think, to be honest, we're still... well, I feel like I am in the mindset that's
[57:00.870 --> 57:03.830]  similar to the old style Let's Play, where we would just record all the time
[57:03.830 --> 57:04.930]  and stuff would come out all the time.
[57:05.190 --> 57:11.490]  It's taken me a lot to get used to the cadence of recording less often and putting less out.
[57:11.810 --> 57:14.270]  How do you mean? Because I think I agree with you.
[57:14.310 --> 57:17.410]  I guess I was just used to doing it every day and videos would come out every day.
[57:17.570 --> 57:19.670]  Yeah, you definitely get used to the pace.
[57:19.670 --> 57:21.630]  And like when we were in that treadmill.
[57:21.990 --> 57:25.290]  And it definitely feels weird to go like half speed again.
[57:25.650 --> 57:30.410]  If we want to add another Let's Play recording day to the calendar, I'm all for it.
[57:30.630 --> 57:32.730]  I'm not complaining and I'm not advocating for that.
[57:32.770 --> 57:33.670]  And I don't say I mind it.
[57:33.710 --> 57:35.010]  I'm just saying that I agree with Gavin.
[57:35.330 --> 57:38.850]  It is weird to be doing it again and be doing it at such a
[57:38.850 --> 57:40.850]  slower pace, I guess would be the way to put it, yeah.
[57:41.750 --> 57:43.350]  Good or bad, it's just interesting.
[57:44.330 --> 57:46.490]  It definitely feels like there was like, I don't know,
[57:46.530 --> 57:48.150]  just a different vibe, a whole different world.
[57:48.770 --> 57:52.090]  Yeah, because I feel like I go weeks where I feel like we
[57:52.090 --> 57:54.290]  should make a video and then we we just don't get around to it.
[57:54.350 --> 57:55.790]  There's just so much to play.
[57:56.170 --> 58:01.650]  Yeah, we before like Let's Play even really started, I had a an evening where I went,
[58:01.770 --> 58:04.990]  oh, fuck, like, what are we what are the video ideas going to be like?
[58:05.030 --> 58:06.250]  Do we have enough for a year?
[58:06.470 --> 58:09.390]  And I wrote out like 60 just video ideas.
[58:09.650 --> 58:13.070]  And I don't think we've done more than five of what I wrote at that time.
[58:13.350 --> 58:17.050]  I would never worry about running out of video game ideas.
[58:17.050 --> 58:19.210]  No, I don't think that's going to be an issue for us.
[58:19.470 --> 58:23.170]  Yeah, maybe maybe running out of good ideas, but definitely not ideas.
[58:24.390 --> 58:25.690]  That happened long ago.
[58:25.870 --> 58:26.430]  That's fine.
[58:26.750 --> 58:28.810]  We've already dealt with that problem.
[58:30.510 --> 58:34.390]  I think would be great as long as you guys are open to it, because it's like for me,
[58:34.410 --> 58:39.990]  so much of it is making sure it doesn't become a burden to do because right now it's so much fun.
[58:40.410 --> 58:45.870]  As long as I don't have to invent and build a game in Minecraft
[58:46.430 --> 58:53.110]  and then force four to six assholes who are constantly trying to undermine
[58:53.110 --> 58:57.750]  the point of the video and the competition and run them through it.
[58:57.790 --> 58:59.790]  As long as I don't have to do that, I'm fine.
[59:04.890 --> 59:07.890]  Well, I'm so excited for what we've been doing in that field.
[59:08.150 --> 59:11.070]  And as soon as we finish, like it's always like, oh, I want to do more,
[59:11.270 --> 59:12.570]  which is the perfect feeling.
[59:12.850 --> 59:14.150]  It is the best feeling to end on.
[59:14.150 --> 59:17.610]  Yeah, I think we could increase slightly because I'm definitely not anywhere near
[59:17.610 --> 59:20.170]  the point where it's like, oh, man, too much, too much.
[59:20.370 --> 59:23.170]  Yeah, like maybe one more day that is not like,
[59:23.330 --> 59:27.030]  like maybe a 45 minute type window to just do like one more video.
[59:27.150 --> 59:27.750]  I think would be great.
[59:28.230 --> 59:30.890]  Yeah, I agree, because it's like I want to do selfishly.
[59:30.930 --> 59:32.410]  I want to do trucks constantly, right?
[59:32.470 --> 59:33.530]  I'd like to do trucks every week.
[59:33.530 --> 59:35.750]  And I think that the audience would like that based on what I'm reading.
[59:37.590 --> 59:41.630]  But to do trucks every week really cuts down on what else we can do.
[59:41.630 --> 59:43.950]  So it's like it feels weird.
[59:44.090 --> 59:45.310]  It's basically become the truck channel.
[59:45.790 --> 59:48.330]  Yeah, I feel like there's not a lot of experimentation time either.
[59:48.710 --> 59:51.270]  Yeah, like like I'd be excited to do the
[59:51.850 --> 59:53.890]  blowing people off parachutes with bomb drones.
[59:54.210 --> 59:57.030]  Yeah, but that's that's not something I was thinking about that last night.
[59:57.130 --> 01:00:00.390]  In like 40 minutes, we'd need to actually put some work into that.
[01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:03.890]  Be prepared to, you know, spend maybe like 90 to two hours trying to get it.
[01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:06.110]  But I don't know. It's it's tough with our current slot.
[01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:10.310]  It is. But well, it sounds like maybe we'll look at after this recording,
[01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:11.470]  figure something out for that.
[01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:12.470]  Does that be awesome?
[01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:16.590]  Any excuse to spend more time playing games with everyone here?
[01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:19.170]  Yeah, I'm all for it. Let's figure it out.
[01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:24.530]  I can I tell you something really dumb if we're talking about pronunciations of
[01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:30.570]  issues? Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:32.630]  Something I didn't share with you guys.
[01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:34.630]  And this has been something that happened a while ago.
[01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:39.830]  And I realized to understand the distance of time, it was probably like
[01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:42.930]  three or four weeks where I thought this.
[01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:47.810]  We had a for the merch meeting near the end of the year in December.
[01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:50.870]  We had like end of year merch meeting where we evaluated like
[01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:56.230]  the sales of everything and how stuff is doing and all that stuff and looking at numbers and whatnot.
[01:00:56.670 --> 01:01:00.810]  And I completely misinterpreted what a specific word meant.
[01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:06.290]  And it completely shifted my perspective of how things were going for us.
[01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:09.270]  There is a section titled returns.
[01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:16.850]  And that is that section is items that have been returned and the cost of returning those items.
[01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:23.710]  Whatever return was stated, I thought that was the profit return of whatever those items were.
[01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:27.370]  So literally, does the returns are always in the negative?
[01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:31.030]  And I thought like, wait, we didn't.
[01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:32.650]  We're negative in everything.
[01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:34.430]  Every single thing is negative.
[01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:35.510]  How is this happening?
[01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:37.550]  How are the Gerflers negative?
[01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:39.490]  That I felt really dumb.
[01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:43.550]  That three weeks later, exceptionally dumb way to look at it was
[01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:48.730]  one of the all time dumb moments for me is realizing when I was looking at the sheet later.
[01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:53.950]  Oh, this is their product returns, not not actual return.
[01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:56.130]  And was it like you?
[01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:57.710]  You didn't know you didn't know.
[01:01:57.810 --> 01:01:59.870]  So it's not like you could you could have thought to ask.
[01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:03.650]  I thought Face was shutting down in the next week.
[01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:05.670]  Was my walk away.
[01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:12.150]  It's like if this is if if everything if the things that are selling out immediately and have
[01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:16.630]  a lot of enthusiasm for we're losing money still on what this is, this is over.
[01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:18.070]  And I'm very sad about this.
[01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:24.270]  I used to struggle a lot, especially at school where I would freak out on the spot
[01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:27.110]  if I didn't understand something and I would just not ask.
[01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.250]  And I would feel like too much time has passed.
[01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:32.150]  And then I would have to try and figure out what the teacher meant.
[01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:35.270]  I remember I was doing I had to do like a newspaper.
[01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:36.890]  It was like a magazine cover.
[01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:39.050]  I had to like design that for media.
[01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:40.870]  And I had the picture there.
[01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:43.010]  And then I was like showing the teacher at the end.
[01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:45.550]  And she was like, yeah, that's great.
[01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:45.910]  It's great.
[01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:46.790]  It's great framing.
[01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:48.370]  And obviously it needs the copy.
[01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:53.270]  And I was like, oh, yeah, yeah, of course it needs the copy.
[01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:54.830]  And I just walked away.
[01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:56.070]  I was like, what is she talking about?
[01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:59.910]  And I couldn't I don't know how to Google either because it was like,
[01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:01.750]  well, I don't know if Google was about, but I couldn't.
[01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:04.730]  I couldn't even figure out how to search it online because it would just bring up other
[01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:06.270]  mentions of copy.
[01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:08.250]  I couldn't figure out that she meant the text.
[01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:09.390]  But I sat there.
[01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:12.630]  I probably wasted two whole lessons trying to figure out what she was talking about.
[01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:14.550]  I used to do that all the time.
[01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:17.590]  Now I just ask the question straight to your face.
[01:03:18.310 --> 01:03:21.010]  Yeah, that's that's the better way to be for sure.
[01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:22.150]  This is fun.
[01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:23.150]  What's this picture doing?
[01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:25.230]  Oh, that's nothing important.
[01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:26.590]  I just Emily sent that to me.
[01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:27.890]  She was looking through the wedding photos.
[01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:31.390]  And it was just a photo of me, Eric and Gavin at the wedding.
[01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:34.070]  That's a rare picture of Eric and his invisible wife.
[01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:37.070]  Well, yeah, my arms, my arms around her.
[01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:38.970]  And we're all laughing and having fun.
[01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:40.750]  But Geoff is concerned about her.
[01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:45.890]  So I'm just I'm like, I'm glad it was clarified that it's invisible.
[01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:48.850]  I thought it was Eric going like, and the rat was this big.
[01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:50.970]  And Gavin thinks that's great.
[01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:53.110]  And Geoff is like, rats really shouldn't be that big.
[01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:55.950]  I don't think that's the size of a small blimp.
[01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:00.950]  Let's throw a logo on that rat.
[01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:05.010]  Do you think that's the closest your hand has been to my penis yet?
[01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:07.710]  Almost certainly not.
[01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:09.410]  Like, you know what?
[01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:10.550]  I'll say yet.
[01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:12.270]  Yeah, yeah, we'll give it.
[01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:14.110]  Let's see if we can get a little bit closer next time.
[01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:15.370]  Not me.
[01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:17.070]  No, definitely not.
[01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:19.770]  I've been all over that thing.
[01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:26.790]  I mean, you flicked my penis to the point where you've been closer to my penis than my penis was.
[01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:30.990]  Because you've like dislodged it.
[01:04:31.930 --> 01:04:32.510]  That's true.
[01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:33.210]  Oh, man.
[01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:35.610]  Hey, hey, you know what, though?
[01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:37.350]  It's fucking friendship, man.
[01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:38.330]  That's what we do.
[01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:40.710]  I'm here for your penis.
[01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:41.530]  You're here for mine.
[01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:42.670]  Forever.
[01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:47.250]  It's just a couple of dudes.
[01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:48.810]  The bond of friendship.
[01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:51.750]  I feel like you've touched mine more, but I've seen yours more.
[01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:54.050]  You've definitely seen mine more.
[01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:57.030]  This is such a weird way to go out on this one, guys.
[01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:59.270]  It's a pretty weird way to come in, to be honest.
[01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:05.530]  Oh, man.
[01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:08.310]  I'm so glad today went well.
[01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:11.310]  My notes for this fucking episode are...
[01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:15.630]  Do you ever mix cereal?
[01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:23.650]  Guys, this might be one of the last 10 episodes of this show.
[01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:25.670]  Oh, no, the returns were real.
[01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:28.130]  The returns on this episode are going to be fucking real.
[01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:28.830]  Brother.
[01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:33.290]  No, I was going to ask because all I had was a little bit of Chex
[01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:35.050]  and a little bit of Fruity Pebbles.
[01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:36.530]  And I was like, I want fucking cereal.
[01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:39.230]  So I mixed it together and it was great.
[01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:42.470]  And I started thinking we should combine cereals more
[01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:45.230]  because this is an awesome, unexpected combination.
[01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:46.910]  Chex and Fruity Pebbles.
[01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:50.310]  So I just have to experiment with that.
[01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:52.610]  That was my insight today.
[01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:57.370]  If you could send an item back through time to you as a kid,
[01:05:58.230 --> 01:06:00.710]  what item would blow your dick off the most?
[01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:02.810]  Loaded gun.
[01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:08.070]  Yeah, I mean, that might be it, huh?
[01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:10.590]  Hot dog cannon.
[01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:16.730]  I was thinking about this the other day, actually.
[01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:18.650]  I was thinking about doing a soul ride on it.
[01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:21.250]  Sometimes when I drive around, I was on my way to meet Eric.
[01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:22.810]  We were doing a special recording.
[01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:26.870]  And sometimes when I'm driving around, I like to pretend it's like the 1950s
[01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:29.470]  and I'm seeing everything around me for the first time
[01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:31.250]  and what would stand out to me, you know?
[01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:34.670]  That's like one step away from having one of those gummy Coke bottles
[01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:35.730]  and pretending you're a giant.
[01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:37.170]  Yeah, I guess so.
[01:06:37.890 --> 01:06:38.770]  I guess it is.
[01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:40.070]  Just driving around being like,
[01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:41.950]  what would stand out to somebody from the 1950s?
[01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:43.930]  Because a lot of the streets you drive by and you'd be like,
[01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:45.990]  I just see houses that look about the same, you know?
[01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:47.850]  But Lime Scooters got me.
[01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:51.010]  Like, how would I explain Lime Scooters to somebody from the 50s?
[01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:52.550]  And be like, yeah, it's just that you rent it.
[01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:54.110]  And they're like, who do I rent it from?
[01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:55.330]  And you're like, nobody.
[01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:57.270]  You just put your phone at it.
[01:06:57.350 --> 01:06:59.190]  And they're like, a fucking phone for my house?
[01:06:59.210 --> 01:06:59.990]  How does that make sense?
[01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:01.330]  And then you gotta explain cell phones.
[01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:03.950]  And then you gotta explain computers and online transactions.
[01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:09.070]  And also this magic thing will turn on without being plugged in anywhere
[01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:10.390]  and just start to be operational.
[01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:13.370]  And I was thinking, man, that would be a really hard thing to wrap your head around.
[01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:14.350]  So I guess I'm gonna say...
[01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:15.490]  That's so many steps removed.
[01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:16.810]  So many steps removed, right?
[01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:19.570]  So I'm gonna say it would blow my dick off to see a Lime Scooter.
[01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:22.930]  I think just handing myself a Nintendo Switch
[01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:25.570]  would completely sever my penis.
[01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:27.310]  Yeah, it's probably about it.
[01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:27.770]  Yeah.
[01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:31.150]  I mean, that would definitely be like, this is where I wanted the world to go.
[01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.390]  I can't believe we got there.
[01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:37.530]  For me, and this is like, once again, video game field, and it doesn't seem amazing.
[01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:43.150]  But I, as a kid, played like six hours of Kingdom Hearts, never saved.
[01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:46.370]  The system got turned off and I just never revisited it again.
[01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:49.490]  Being able to show how like a modern Xbox works,
[01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:52.830]  where I could turn the system back on and it's just exactly where I paused.
[01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:57.150]  And that being the way for like every single player game I played would blow my mind.
[01:07:57.370 --> 01:07:58.110]  Dude, quick resume.
[01:07:58.590 --> 01:07:59.230]  Oh my god.
[01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:01.390]  Yeah, like quick resume is an idea of like,
[01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:02.550]  I don't even have to go through the menu.
[01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:04.030]  It's literally where I paused.
[01:08:04.530 --> 01:08:05.370]  It's crazy.
[01:08:05.610 --> 01:08:06.950]  That would blow my mind.
[01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:10.710]  I think conversely, the internet is way more annoying now than it was
[01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:12.390]  when I first started using it.
[01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:16.130]  The internet seemed to make a real turn.
[01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:18.710]  It used to like show you exactly what you wanted.
[01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:22.750]  And now the internet just shows you what it wants on every website.
[01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:24.830]  Yeah, pretty much.
[01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:27.390]  And I'm just so not interested.
[01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:32.230]  Do you remember voice masking, Geoff, on the original Xbox?
[01:08:33.790 --> 01:08:35.070]  Uh, no, I don't.
[01:08:35.190 --> 01:08:37.030]  I mean, not specifically, no.
[01:08:37.230 --> 01:08:38.110]  It's so sad.
[01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:39.390]  I was talking to Gavin about it.
[01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:40.910]  He had no idea what I was talking about.
[01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:41.950]  I didn't.
[01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:43.670]  I realized my research of it.
[01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:45.210]  I remember it being in Halo 2.
[01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:48.630]  Like that was a feature for Xbox Live is that you could have a voice mask
[01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:50.590]  and you sounded like a muffled Darth Vader.
[01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:52.050]  Like it sounded like shit.
[01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:56.030]  But I guess certain original Xbox games had their own different, unique
[01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:57.690]  voice masking options to them.
[01:08:58.070 --> 01:09:00.610]  And that is something that went away that I would love to see come back.
[01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:03.850]  You know what I miss that that video games had for a little while?
[01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:07.450]  I think it was the original Xbox when I would play Burnout Paradise.
[01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:08.870]  Or not Burnout Paradise.
[01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:09.190]  I'm sorry.
[01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:09.690]  That'd be a three.
[01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:11.090]  That's a Xbox 360 game.
[01:09:11.230 --> 01:09:14.430]  But the Burnout 2 or whatever it was.
[01:09:14.530 --> 01:09:15.990]  Burnout Revenge or whatever.
[01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:18.450]  You could rip a CD.
[01:09:19.570 --> 01:09:20.190]  Burnout, maybe it's Takedown.
[01:09:20.190 --> 01:09:23.290]  You could rip a CD, a music CD to your Xbox.
[01:09:24.150 --> 01:09:26.590]  And then that or a couple.
[01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:30.670]  And then you could go into Burnout and you could play the radio station.
[01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:32.070]  You could just put your music.
[01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:35.370]  And so like I had this album that I was listening to all the time from this band
[01:09:35.370 --> 01:09:36.610]  Star Market that I used to love.
[01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:39.590]  And I would just listen to that while I played Burnout.
[01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:42.750]  And I remember thinking like this is I'm living in the future right now.
[01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:47.390]  This is this is going to change how I play video games for the rest of my life.
[01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:50.650]  And then I never played another video game that had that again.
[01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.330]  I don't think ever after that.
[01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:57.590]  The 360, I was ripping discs for like audio discs and playing it as music.
[01:09:57.670 --> 01:09:59.050]  The background instead games I'd play.
[01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:00.010]  I do that all the time.
[01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.930]  I play like Gears of War.
[01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:01.410]  It was awesome.
[01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:06.850]  I think that the GTA 3 era of GTA games, you could do that on PC.
[01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:09.270]  You could just have a folder with your own radio station.
[01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:11.870]  That was playing PC games then.
[01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:15.550]  I remember the Xbox music player for the original Xbox.
[01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:17.270]  Like that was supposed to be cool.
[01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:21.730]  Where it's just the track listing and then a light that would like bounce to the music.
[01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:23.090]  Oh, yeah, like the visualizer.
[01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:26.710]  Yeah, like it was a different built out functionality for playing audio.
[01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:29.630]  You know when navigating simple menus would be like...
[01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:35.530]  It's like you're playing Bushido Blade.
[01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:42.150]  Well, Xbox had like a nuclear reactor thing to it, too, of like...
[01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:44.830]  And you're just like, I want to put subtitles on.
[01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:46.090]  Like, I want to...
[01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:47.870]  I'm just changing a basic setting.
[01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:51.510]  We don't need to like explode the Xbox to do this.
[01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:55.810]  You sent me a video of the guy testing out the voice filters.
[01:10:56.290 --> 01:11:01.410]  And I've got to say, I really rose-colored glasses what Xbox Live used to sound like.
[01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:04.090]  In my head, it just kind of sounds like Discord.
[01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:07.510]  But you hear it now and it's like, oh, it's like Nick in the mask.
[01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.470]  Yeah.
[01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:17.290]  What's another thing that would blow your dick off?
[01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:18.910]  What? No, end this.
[01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:20.590]  If this podcast kept going?
[01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:24.310]  Podcasts would blow your dick off.
[01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:25.130]  Yeah.
[01:11:25.330 --> 01:11:26.850]  I found podcasts pretty young, though.
[01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:30.650]  This is AM radio, but you can listen to it whenever.
[01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.410]  This is not...
[01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:33.230]  You know what blows my dick off about podcasts?
[01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:36.210]  The first podcast I listened to was in like 2006.
[01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:38.750]  The Lost Show had a podcast.
[01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:43.010]  And it was like Damon Lindelof and whatever his... the other guy.
[01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:45.310]  They would do a weekly podcast.
[01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:47.030]  And that was my introduction to it.
[01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:50.230]  And I just thought it's so wild that of all the things...
[01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:52.430]  I don't know who at like ABC thought that was a good idea,
[01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:56.210]  but they were ahead of their time as far as like what shows should be doing.
[01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:58.610]  I think my first one was the Ricky Gervais podcast.
[01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:03.630]  And that was just the radio show adapted, right?
[01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:05.930]  Did they actually do a podcast?
[01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:11.070]  No, they basically quit XFM and then started the podcast with KP.
[01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:15.670]  God damn. I have no idea what the first podcast I ever listened to would have been.
[01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:18.270]  Do you think you made a podcast before you listened to one?
[01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:20.290]  Probably. Honestly, yeah.
[01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:23.450]  Yeah, I probably... I mean, I probably listened to some for reference,
[01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:24.590]  but I probably was like, this is trash.
[01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:32.330]  And then, yeah, I didn't really get into podcasts until the pandemic as a fan, you know?
[01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:34.510]  I guess a little bit before the pandemic.
[01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:36.810]  I really around Emily. Emily got me into podcasts.
[01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:40.350]  She was... that's like her main form of entertainment, I'd say.
[01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:45.850]  Huh. I still think it'd blow my dick off if I sent me, an old me, a podcast of me.
[01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:47.630]  Like a f*** face podcast.
[01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:50.450]  Trying to understand what I was doing in the future,
[01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:53.970]  who these people are, how that's distributed, who's listening to it,
[01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.630]  how I got to call them f*** face.
[01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:58.210]  Why you're doing like a weird therapist bit at the beginning and...
[01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:00.910]  Like, how did I... like, holy shit, I went to college and I became a therapist.
[01:13:00.970 --> 01:13:01.470]  That's awesome.
[01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.890]  Absolutely.
[01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:08.670]  Well, my notes have...
[01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:10.950]  Why? Why are we doing this?
[01:13:11.230 --> 01:13:13.990]  This is the end of the podcast.
[01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:16.150]  Well, hold on there. I'm taking care of it.
[01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:20.150]  I guess it's about time to listen to your notes, Gav.
[01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:20.810]  What are you having there?
[01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:23.250]  I guess we'll find out next week.
[01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:28.230]  Cliffhanger.
[01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:31.170]  The premise, not the movie.
[01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.830]  Okay.
[01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:37.910]  It's all needed.
[01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:42.410]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:43.770]  Panton got some support.
[01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:45.170]  It's too wide.
[01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:47.090]  Do not go to the chiropractor.
[01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:48.530]  It's Walmart Gavin.
[01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:50.110]  Gavin won't stop.
[01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:51.230]  Geoff keeps bleeding.
[01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:52.790]  We've got fuzzy new merch.
[01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:55.050]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:57.950]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
