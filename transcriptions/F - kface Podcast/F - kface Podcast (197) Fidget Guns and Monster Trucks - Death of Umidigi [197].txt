[00:10.010 --> 00:11.310]  So here's what I think's happening.
[00:11.850 --> 00:11.990]  Yeah.
[00:12.350 --> 00:14.770]  Last episode he showed up early for pleasantries.
[00:15.150 --> 00:18.810]  I think this episode he's gonna show up late.
[00:19.150 --> 00:20.610]  I don't know what the point is, but...
[00:20.610 --> 00:22.970]  Yeah, I don't know what the point is either, but I think he is proving it.
[00:23.410 --> 00:25.190]  Balance the scales, I like that.
[00:25.610 --> 00:27.550]  Yeah, Gavin is a just man, so...
[00:28.210 --> 00:28.990]  That's true.
[00:30.130 --> 00:31.910]  Gavin, like justice, is blind.
[00:35.910 --> 00:37.530]  He can't read a fucking clock, apparently.
[00:39.470 --> 00:41.170]  While we wait, I guess I can bring this up.
[00:41.270 --> 00:43.690]  Freddie got fingered, got added to the Criterion channel.
[00:44.190 --> 00:44.650]  I saw that.
[00:44.750 --> 00:45.450]  Oh my god.
[00:45.850 --> 00:46.210]  Awesome.
[00:47.290 --> 00:48.190]  Hey, there he is.
[00:49.730 --> 00:53.410]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:53.690 --> 00:54.890]  My name is Geoffrey Ramsey.
[00:54.970 --> 00:57.650]  With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free.
[00:57.810 --> 00:59.250]  I don't know why I said my full name there.
[00:59.830 --> 01:00.470]  That's first.
[01:01.350 --> 01:02.530]  Yeah, I don't...
[01:02.530 --> 01:04.970]  I mean, that is my name, but I don't call myself Geoffrey very often.
[01:05.050 --> 01:06.390]  Oh fuck, am I in trouble with me?
[01:07.350 --> 01:10.270]  Geoffrey was what I would always get called by my mom when I was...
[01:10.270 --> 01:11.710]  Oh no, maybe I'm...
[01:11.710 --> 01:13.110]  Maybe I grounded myself and I don't remember.
[01:13.150 --> 01:14.070]  Are you in your own office?
[01:14.630 --> 01:15.050]  I am.
[01:15.870 --> 01:16.890]  What does that mean?
[01:17.250 --> 01:18.890]  Well, you got sent to the office, but it's yours.
[01:18.890 --> 01:19.970]  Oh, I got sent to my own office.
[01:20.190 --> 01:23.770]  You got sent to your own office by you.
[01:24.150 --> 01:27.250]  I'm all discombobulated because we're recording on a Friday,
[01:27.690 --> 01:31.330]  and now all I can think about is little kids playing with guns.
[01:32.530 --> 01:32.930]  What?
[01:33.610 --> 01:34.310]  It's America.
[01:34.830 --> 01:35.850]  Well, also, I did that.
[01:35.850 --> 01:38.130]  Did you not play with guns, Gavin, as a kid?
[01:38.410 --> 01:39.130]  Play with guns?
[01:39.650 --> 01:40.950]  Yeah, well, like, not real guns.
[01:41.050 --> 01:43.670]  Like, I was a big cap gun guy as a kid.
[01:43.730 --> 01:46.450]  You go to the dollar store, you get a cap gun, it makes the loud noise.
[01:46.610 --> 01:48.530]  Oh yeah, I wasn't really allowed fun stuff.
[01:49.610 --> 01:51.310]  Oh man, that's tragic.
[01:52.010 --> 01:53.750]  I had aliens that could shag each other though.
[01:53.850 --> 01:54.150]  Okay.
[01:56.250 --> 01:58.550]  What do you mean by you weren't allowed fun stuff?
[01:58.590 --> 02:00.130]  By your parents or by your nation?
[02:01.510 --> 02:02.310]  Well, both.
[02:03.090 --> 02:04.570]  Yeah, I think it's all around.
[02:04.570 --> 02:07.230]  I think self-imposed as well, to some extent, I assume.
[02:07.350 --> 02:08.870]  I think it's just a general culture.
[02:09.530 --> 02:11.590]  At one point, yo-yos got banned from my school.
[02:12.130 --> 02:12.530]  Really?
[02:13.110 --> 02:13.370]  Yeah.
[02:13.770 --> 02:15.870]  What happened with the yo-yos? Did someone get taken out?
[02:15.870 --> 02:16.330]  Did they get choked out?
[02:16.550 --> 02:16.790]  Yeah.
[02:17.110 --> 02:21.230]  I can't remember if it was a yo-yo incident where someone got clipped by one,
[02:21.390 --> 02:24.130]  or whether they were just too popular and people were nicking them.
[02:26.930 --> 02:32.430]  I remember Three Ninjas, High Mountain, I think is what that movie was called.
[02:32.430 --> 02:34.850]  It's a Three Ninjas movie with Hulk Hogan in it.
[02:35.110 --> 02:41.210]  One of the kids had like a yo-yo that had like blades on it.
[02:41.310 --> 02:42.730]  And I thought it was the coolest thing ever.
[02:43.230 --> 02:44.750]  And so I wanted to be a yo-yo kid.
[02:44.810 --> 02:46.270]  And I just never, I didn't have the patience.
[02:46.510 --> 02:46.930]  I never learned.
[02:47.350 --> 02:50.730]  Andrew and Gavin, did you guys have lockers in your schools?
[02:51.190 --> 02:53.090]  Like when you went to school, you'd get a locker every year.
[02:53.230 --> 02:54.710]  And then you'd put all your books and stuff.
[02:54.750 --> 02:55.710]  Why do you say yes and then no?
[02:57.150 --> 03:01.470]  I said, yeah, because Eric posted a photo of Three Ninjas High Noon at Mega Mountain,
[03:01.470 --> 03:04.290]  which is a childhood staple of mine.
[03:04.410 --> 03:06.930]  And I said no, because we didn't have lockers.
[03:07.030 --> 03:09.470]  It was like a cubby situation where everybody...
[03:09.470 --> 03:13.390]  We didn't have any storage, but we just carried everything around in our backpacks.
[03:14.090 --> 03:16.230]  Which you couldn't put anywhere because there were no lockers.
[03:17.190 --> 03:19.190]  Did they remove them or were they never there?
[03:20.530 --> 03:22.250]  I mean, at my school, I never saw any.
[03:22.610 --> 03:24.650]  So maybe they were there before I was there.
[03:24.710 --> 03:24.990]  I don't know.
[03:25.210 --> 03:29.250]  In America, we had lockers like in almost every school.
[03:29.250 --> 03:32.250]  And you would get a locker and a combination at the beginning of the year.
[03:32.470 --> 03:35.690]  And then somewhere around high school, when I was in high school,
[03:35.750 --> 03:37.810]  they started pulling them out of schools because of drugs.
[03:37.990 --> 03:40.190]  They were convinced that kids were hiding drugs.
[03:40.390 --> 03:43.930]  And I remember they would have these things where we'd just be in class.
[03:44.390 --> 03:47.650]  And then it would come over the loudspeaker and the principal would say,
[03:47.790 --> 03:48.930]  please lock the doors.
[03:49.050 --> 03:51.470]  No kids are allowed to go out of the room for the next 20 minutes.
[03:51.630 --> 03:55.670]  And they would bring cops and police dogs in to smell all the lockers to find drugs.
[03:55.890 --> 03:58.350]  And then eventually they just started pulling lockers out of schools.
[03:58.350 --> 04:01.370]  So like no schools in America really have lockers anymore.
[04:01.370 --> 04:04.210]  Or if they do, they're there, they just can't use them.
[04:04.490 --> 04:07.130]  Like Millie, I think there's some lockers in her school,
[04:07.250 --> 04:08.870]  but she just can't, they just don't use them.
[04:09.050 --> 04:09.350]  They're just not available.
[04:09.350 --> 04:11.090]  Just there to remind you that you're in a school.
[04:11.530 --> 04:12.390]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:12.770 --> 04:13.110]  Setting.
[04:13.510 --> 04:14.690]  I think it adds atmosphere.
[04:15.330 --> 04:16.170]  Gracie also had them.
[04:16.450 --> 04:18.170]  Gracie said we had them but never touched them.
[04:19.270 --> 04:21.490]  Like, was that a personal choice or were you not allowed to?
[04:21.550 --> 04:23.970]  Were they issued to you or were you just told not to touch them?
[04:24.390 --> 04:25.470]  They weren't even issued.
[04:26.350 --> 04:26.710]  Wow.
[04:26.910 --> 04:27.330]  But they were there.
[04:27.390 --> 04:27.630]  That's pointless.
[04:27.630 --> 04:30.990]  At some point in America, they just became set dressing.
[04:31.370 --> 04:33.250]  They're like phone booths in London.
[04:34.530 --> 04:41.490]  But we had lockers in our gym class where we would change.
[04:41.650 --> 04:43.450]  So why wouldn't I just keep drugs in there?
[04:44.250 --> 04:46.390]  It just never occurred to me until now.
[04:47.230 --> 04:50.050]  Why have lockers for that but not lockers for other stuff?
[04:50.330 --> 04:50.710]  That's weird.
[04:50.770 --> 04:51.390]  We had hooks.
[04:52.050 --> 04:54.030]  That was our big thing, was the hook.
[04:54.130 --> 04:56.710]  You'd walk in, you had a designated hook.
[04:56.710 --> 04:58.570]  That's where your backpack would go.
[04:58.730 --> 05:00.790]  Our gym situation was just benches.
[05:01.150 --> 05:02.530]  Yeah, I had a hook in primary school.
[05:02.790 --> 05:03.770]  Yeah, it was just a hook.
[05:03.990 --> 05:06.270]  I wish I would... I mean, that's a banned thing.
[05:06.510 --> 05:11.810]  Like, a locker is a cool ban thing compared to, like, Gavin, you were yo-yos.
[05:12.090 --> 05:13.150]  Mine was Bionicles.
[05:13.710 --> 05:15.830]  That was the thing that was banned at my school eventually.
[05:17.250 --> 05:19.050]  They said they were dangerous.
[05:19.310 --> 05:20.490]  You don't remember Bionicles, Gavin?
[05:20.990 --> 05:22.210]  Were they like little action figure things?
[05:22.650 --> 05:25.550]  They were like the Lego transformer type thing.
[05:25.550 --> 05:26.470]  They were like mechs.
[05:26.790 --> 05:29.330]  They were like little weird mech things that you would build and you could,
[05:29.530 --> 05:31.470]  if you buy multiples, you can make a big one type thing.
[05:31.510 --> 05:32.710]  Yeah, Eric just posted.
[05:33.050 --> 05:34.670]  Why were they banned?
[05:35.870 --> 05:41.390]  The word on the street was that they were capable of cutting through wood and therefore were dangerous.
[05:41.630 --> 05:43.710]  But that is just not... they're plastic.
[05:43.970 --> 05:45.230]  Oh, they didn't pass the wood test.
[05:45.650 --> 05:47.410]  Yeah, they didn't pass the wood test, unfortunately.
[05:49.010 --> 05:50.910]  The past is so stupid.
[05:51.270 --> 05:51.750]  It is.
[05:52.490 --> 05:55.410]  Grown-ups make the dumbest fucking decisions.
[05:55.650 --> 05:58.770]  Like I was thinking the other day, we might have even talked about this in the past, but I don't know.
[05:59.150 --> 06:01.650]  But I was thinking about the other day when I was like 14.
[06:02.070 --> 06:08.190]  I remember in my shitty little area of Alabama, they had a smurf burning at a church.
[06:09.350 --> 06:13.390]  Where they just brought everybody, they were like smurfs, smurfs are demonic.
[06:13.870 --> 06:14.450]  They're witches.
[06:15.290 --> 06:20.710]  So bring all your smurfs down to the church parking lot and we'll get a bonfire going
[06:20.710 --> 06:25.190]  and we'll all burn plastic and then breathe it in for three hours and sing hymns.
[06:25.250 --> 06:26.830]  That kind of sounds awesome, though.
[06:26.890 --> 06:28.210]  I want to go to a smurf burning.
[06:28.630 --> 06:29.330]  That sounds great.
[06:29.530 --> 06:32.590]  You're gonna have to go back to 1986, but you can definitely do it.
[06:33.750 --> 06:37.690]  That is a deeply disturbing event in the world of smurfs.
[06:38.010 --> 06:38.910]  In smurf history.
[06:39.030 --> 06:41.510]  Such an innocuous cartoon, too.
[06:41.610 --> 06:47.070]  Just about like friendship and love and support and everybody pulling their own weight and caring for each other.
[06:47.270 --> 06:49.670]  And the churches get in and go like, well, he's blue.
[06:50.270 --> 06:53.090]  He's from hell for some reason.
[06:53.390 --> 06:58.370]  Smurfs are in the same category as Mr. Magoo for me, where I couldn't tell you a thing about them.
[06:58.750 --> 07:01.150]  They are just blue men that wear goofy hats.
[07:01.730 --> 07:03.310]  And there's like one woman smurf, right?
[07:03.710 --> 07:05.670]  Yeah, there's like one Smurfette.
[07:06.010 --> 07:07.490]  Yeah, that's all I know.
[07:07.730 --> 07:08.990]  Is she like the queen of the hive?
[07:11.850 --> 07:13.910]  Like she gives birth to all the other smurfs?
[07:14.110 --> 07:18.070]  No, I think Smurfette was created by Gargamel.
[07:18.070 --> 07:19.670]  Kind of an asexual cartoon.
[07:20.070 --> 07:22.950]  No, Smurfette was created by Gargamel to infiltrate the smurfs.
[07:23.050 --> 07:25.490]  But then I think she went, oh, wow, this is really cool over here.
[07:25.550 --> 07:26.870]  So then she just keeps hanging out.
[07:27.130 --> 07:29.250]  Because why would you want to hang out with that guy and his weird cat?
[07:29.650 --> 07:30.510]  Yeah, that is true.
[07:30.990 --> 07:33.130]  But there's no shenanigans going on with the smurfs.
[07:33.310 --> 07:34.990]  It's a it's just it's very wholesome.
[07:35.410 --> 07:39.730]  I was just reminded of a time where I made a bunch of five pound bets with people.
[07:39.930 --> 07:42.530]  And I won all of them because I had inside info.
[07:43.510 --> 07:43.870]  Really?
[07:44.850 --> 07:47.350]  I mean, this was when would this have been?
[07:49.870 --> 07:51.030]  Secondary school, I assume.
[07:51.630 --> 07:55.250]  But I made bets with everyone that I knew the title of the next GTA.
[07:56.610 --> 08:03.110]  And I said, I know it's going to be San Andreas because I just played GTA 1 and the three
[08:03.110 --> 08:05.270]  cities and Liberty City, Vice City and San Andreas.
[08:07.590 --> 08:09.750]  And most people hadn't played GTA 1.
[08:10.350 --> 08:12.190]  You were just making a very educated guess.
[08:12.510 --> 08:15.070]  Yeah, I wouldn't say that's insider information.
[08:15.230 --> 08:16.590]  You just played the game.
[08:16.590 --> 08:21.290]  I don't insider information to me implies knowledge that you could not access.
[08:21.290 --> 08:24.490]  You can't get insider information for playing an outside game.
[08:25.130 --> 08:27.870]  Yeah, I didn't have connections to Rockstar when I was 12.
[08:29.190 --> 08:33.650]  I, for some reason, imagine this was a much more recent bet for you that this was like
[08:33.650 --> 08:36.110]  two years ago before you set up the timeline.
[08:36.470 --> 08:38.190]  The fact you're a kid makes it so much funnier.
[08:38.470 --> 08:41.790]  Anyway, I don't think we ever expressly mentioned it in the episode.
[08:41.910 --> 08:45.850]  But before you got here, Gavin, we were looking at pictures of fidget guns,
[08:45.850 --> 08:51.590]  fidget weapons, and just found like a treasure trove of little children and their parents
[08:51.590 --> 08:52.290]  playing with guns.
[08:52.530 --> 08:53.670]  And so we were sending each other images.
[08:53.990 --> 08:57.790]  And I'll put all that on the Instagram when this episode comes out, because it's too funny
[08:57.790 --> 08:58.710]  not to not to show.
[08:58.970 --> 08:59.390]  They're great.
[08:59.590 --> 09:03.650]  If you're to look at them, Gavin, it is just our perception of all advertising in America
[09:03.650 --> 09:04.030]  forever.
[09:04.210 --> 09:06.410]  Yeah, it's what the world feels about America.
[09:09.110 --> 09:10.830]  The kids happy time.
[09:11.690 --> 09:14.550]  The mom showing the little girl the fucking gun.
[09:14.590 --> 09:14.970]  Oh, dear.
[09:14.970 --> 09:16.670]  While she's got a crayon in her hand.
[09:16.810 --> 09:17.770]  It's really cool.
[09:17.870 --> 09:20.230]  Me and Nick are fidget weapons guys now.
[09:20.310 --> 09:21.390]  Nick, do you have your gun ready?
[09:25.050 --> 09:26.350]  They don't fire anything.
[09:26.470 --> 09:28.350]  They just make a noise and feel good.
[09:29.010 --> 09:33.410]  It's like the lamest shootout of all time where neither of you have any ammo and you're
[09:33.410 --> 09:36.990]  just firing an empty mag at each other over and over again.
[09:37.290 --> 09:40.810]  It's like that video of those two people in the street flipping each other off.
[09:40.950 --> 09:42.870]  That's absolutely what this is.
[09:47.010 --> 09:52.950]  It's just leaning in harder each time and like really slamming your arm out there.
[09:57.820 --> 09:59.700]  Hey, I got a question for you guys.
[09:59.820 --> 10:03.700]  It's a it's a bleed over from a personal conversation Eric and I were having and I want to get everybody's
[10:03.700 --> 10:03.980]  opinion.
[10:05.000 --> 10:06.840]  How big do you think an appendix is?
[10:08.940 --> 10:10.480]  Oh, like with your hand.
[10:10.720 --> 10:14.300]  Like, is it like I said, I thought it was about the size of a fist, maybe a little.
[10:14.720 --> 10:14.840]  Yeah, I agree.
[10:14.940 --> 10:15.280]  Fist.
[10:15.600 --> 10:16.760]  Eric, what did you say?
[10:17.180 --> 10:18.100]  I want Gavin to guess.
[10:18.100 --> 10:19.140]  Gavin, how big do you think it is?
[10:19.300 --> 10:23.660]  I thought it was going to be like, like if I put my finger in my thumb, maybe like the
[10:23.660 --> 10:24.200]  size of a dick.
[10:24.420 --> 10:27.700]  All right, that doesn't help.
[10:28.480 --> 10:29.380]  What shape is it?
[10:29.400 --> 10:30.400]  Is it long or is it a ball?
[10:30.700 --> 10:31.520]  It's up for you, man.
[10:31.760 --> 10:32.240]  You tell us.
[10:32.300 --> 10:33.140]  I assume it's a ball.
[10:33.560 --> 10:35.600]  I just thought it was a ball when it was about to explode.
[10:35.660 --> 10:36.400]  Is it always a ball?
[10:37.920 --> 10:39.280]  I assumed it was always a ball.
[10:39.360 --> 10:41.920]  I never considered to change shape during the explosion.
[10:42.020 --> 10:42.680]  I thought it was long.
[10:42.900 --> 10:43.980]  The explosion would dictate the shape.
[10:44.180 --> 10:45.820]  Well, bombs are in cartoons.
[10:46.020 --> 10:46.860]  Bombs are round.
[10:46.860 --> 10:49.540]  So I guess for it to explode, it would have to assume a round shape.
[10:49.800 --> 10:52.920]  Yeah, but before it explodes, is a bomb not round?
[10:53.080 --> 10:54.080]  Is a bomb a different...
[10:54.080 --> 10:54.660]  That's a good question.
[10:54.980 --> 10:55.200]  Yeah.
[10:55.220 --> 10:55.840]  I'll have to go back and check.
[10:55.840 --> 10:59.200]  I don't know that that's a good question, but I guess it sort of fits here.
[10:59.280 --> 11:00.820]  I think we may have a market here.
[11:01.140 --> 11:03.000]  No one's making triangle bombs.
[11:03.140 --> 11:04.700]  We got to make some triangle bombs.
[11:06.340 --> 11:07.920]  You need a square bomb.
[11:08.060 --> 11:09.500]  I guess C4 is square, right?
[11:09.540 --> 11:10.720]  And that's definitely a bomb.
[11:10.860 --> 11:12.040]  So that's it taken care of.
[11:12.100 --> 11:13.740]  But I've never seen a triangle bomb.
[11:13.740 --> 11:17.980]  In the first Star Trek remake movie, don't they go through a bomb field that's all triangles?
[11:18.380 --> 11:19.800]  That's the future, though.
[11:19.860 --> 11:20.040]  Sure.
[11:20.160 --> 11:21.520]  Oh, OK. That still has to be invented.
[11:21.660 --> 11:23.800]  I don't have the insider knowledge of seeing the film.
[11:24.180 --> 11:27.340]  So bombs are either round or shaped like hot dogs strapped together.
[11:28.660 --> 11:29.140]  Is it?
[11:29.580 --> 11:30.420]  Wait, hang on.
[11:30.580 --> 11:33.340]  Gavin, are these the bombs from Star Trek?
[11:33.640 --> 11:33.880]  No.
[11:34.320 --> 11:34.500]  No.
[11:35.600 --> 11:35.880]  All right.
[11:36.960 --> 11:37.680]  Missile ends.
[11:38.660 --> 11:41.260]  That's what I thought. I looked at... I googled it. I wanted to see.
[11:41.260 --> 11:45.760]  Anyway, I thought an appendix was like maybe like in like two inches.
[11:46.880 --> 11:47.680]  Two inches?
[11:48.280 --> 11:50.780]  I didn't think it was like very long. I thought it was like two.
[11:50.860 --> 11:51.900]  I thought it was like a small thing.
[11:53.040 --> 11:54.440]  Get out of here, two inches.
[11:54.880 --> 11:57.460]  That in my mind for how when someone says...
[11:58.580 --> 12:00.160]  No, no, I'm explaining.
[12:00.480 --> 12:01.560]  Let me get to it.
[12:01.660 --> 12:02.560]  I'm getting there.
[12:02.780 --> 12:03.780]  I'm getting there.
[12:04.060 --> 12:04.700]  What the fuck?
[12:04.920 --> 12:07.800]  No, I'm getting there to the visual in my head.
[12:07.800 --> 12:12.700]  In my mind, when an appendix explodes, it is violent.
[12:12.900 --> 12:18.640]  It is like when the guy gets his heart ripped out at Indiana Jones or like a chestburster.
[12:18.960 --> 12:21.080]  In my mind, that's how it always worked.
[12:21.380 --> 12:26.460]  So the idea of it being like a two inch thing is like when in Mission Impossible 1,
[12:26.660 --> 12:29.580]  he puts the gum bomb on the thing and explode.
[12:29.920 --> 12:31.620]  Like that is the level that's ridiculous.
[12:32.200 --> 12:32.620]  That's too small.
[12:32.740 --> 12:34.360]  All bombs can be gum. I forgot about that.
[12:34.480 --> 12:36.200]  That's true. There is a gum bomb.
[12:36.660 --> 12:38.720]  You can make a gum into triangles.
[12:39.080 --> 12:40.820]  If you want to quickly empty an aquarium.
[12:43.380 --> 12:44.220]  I'm going to...
[12:44.220 --> 12:46.300]  I have an answer here. I've looked it up.
[12:46.800 --> 12:47.800]  Okay, how big is it?
[12:48.040 --> 12:51.500]  Oh, I never heard from Nick and Gracie how big they thought the appendix was.
[12:51.700 --> 12:52.600]  I thought it was like a palm.
[12:53.040 --> 12:53.360]  The size of your palm.
[12:53.360 --> 12:54.100]  Okay, like a palm.
[12:54.200 --> 12:54.380]  Yeah.
[12:54.500 --> 12:54.940]  All right.
[12:55.960 --> 12:57.480]  Are you saying palm or palm?
[12:58.120 --> 12:58.480]  Palm?
[12:59.280 --> 13:00.260]  Like the palm of your hand?
[13:00.320 --> 13:00.820]  The palm of your hand.
[13:00.920 --> 13:01.580]  Like the drink?
[13:02.500 --> 13:02.860]  What?
[13:03.100 --> 13:03.520]  What's happening?
[13:03.520 --> 13:03.660]  What's happening?
[13:04.800 --> 13:06.320]  Gracie said half a foot.
[13:06.420 --> 13:08.500]  Okay, but like here's the thing.
[13:08.760 --> 13:09.400]  Like a long foot?
[13:10.020 --> 13:16.740]  Six inches isn't a crazy guess, but saying half a foot makes it sound fucking nuts.
[13:16.980 --> 13:17.380]  Wait, what?
[13:17.720 --> 13:17.820]  Oh.
[13:18.340 --> 13:20.580]  Twelve half of... six inches.
[13:20.800 --> 13:21.380]  Okay, thank you.
[13:21.920 --> 13:23.920]  All right, so Gracie said six inches.
[13:24.340 --> 13:26.240]  Twelve inch, not feet. What does that mean?
[13:28.360 --> 13:29.380]  Oh, like the feet.
[13:30.000 --> 13:30.240]  Yeah.
[13:31.160 --> 13:33.100]  Like I'm not talking about the body part.
[13:34.040 --> 13:34.880]  Right, right, right.
[13:37.120 --> 13:40.820]  So, okay, we got a six inches. We got a palm. We got a fist.
[13:41.580 --> 13:44.300]  We got a penis. And what was you?
[13:44.540 --> 13:44.940]  What were you?
[13:45.160 --> 13:46.180]  I said like two inches.
[13:46.600 --> 13:47.020]  Like two inches.
[13:47.160 --> 13:48.740]  A fist. I'm with you. I think it's like a fist.
[13:49.960 --> 13:51.140]  Here's why I said fist.
[13:51.280 --> 13:54.320]  Because when I was a kid and you'd go to the doctor and they have the guy that you can
[13:54.320 --> 13:57.100]  play with all those organs and they all fall out and you try to put them back together.
[13:57.200 --> 13:58.080]  They're all pretty big, right?
[13:58.640 --> 14:02.160]  Uh, the appendix is usually eight to ten centimeters,
[14:02.480 --> 14:06.280]  three to four inches long and less than 1.3 centimeters wide.
[14:06.400 --> 14:07.540]  So it's about Gavin's penis.
[14:07.960 --> 14:08.740]  Yeah, it's a penis.
[14:10.020 --> 14:11.980]  It's appendix. It's in the name.
[14:13.960 --> 14:14.940]  That checks out.
[14:16.600 --> 14:17.720]  That's just good science.
[14:22.010 --> 14:24.330]  So it's long and skinny. It's like a little sausage.
[14:25.210 --> 14:28.010]  Can someone just post a picture of one that isn't too gruesome for me?
[14:28.430 --> 14:29.770]  It's like a sausage.
[14:30.330 --> 14:31.490]  Can someone do the work?
[14:34.230 --> 14:35.450]  It's the blue part.
[14:35.630 --> 14:38.810]  Oh, that's nothing. That's not crazy.
[14:39.230 --> 14:39.870]  That's nothing.
[14:40.130 --> 14:41.150]  That's so disappointing.
[14:41.630 --> 14:47.690]  Now, here's the thing. The reason you think it's round is because when it's inflamed,
[14:47.790 --> 14:49.290]  it starts going into a bomb shape.
[14:49.490 --> 14:50.250]  Yeah, it gets bomb shaped.
[14:51.890 --> 14:55.270]  Oh, that's a cooked appendix. That's a grenade that's ready to go.
[14:56.250 --> 14:58.310]  Somebody definitely pulled the pin on that appendix.
[14:58.310 --> 14:58.790]  Yeah.
[14:59.510 --> 15:00.750]  I'll be to throw back.
[15:02.410 --> 15:06.410]  Oh, man. Have you ever had the Sour Patch Kids heads before?
[15:08.530 --> 15:08.990]  No.
[15:09.590 --> 15:10.010]  Heads?
[15:10.450 --> 15:15.290]  Heads. Yeah. The specific. Is that a Canadian thing? Is that not in America?
[15:15.690 --> 15:16.710]  Sour Patch Kids heads?
[15:18.150 --> 15:19.350]  I'm not familiar with them.
[15:19.550 --> 15:23.790]  OK, never mind. I was just going to say that they one of the heads,
[15:23.970 --> 15:26.830]  I'd say the main head in a batch of Sour Patch Kids heads
[15:26.830 --> 15:30.690]  is the same color as the bomb from Mission Impossible 1, the gum bomb.
[15:31.150 --> 15:36.610]  And because of that, I refuse to let the ends touch because that is how the bomb goes off.
[15:37.030 --> 15:40.410]  I eat it in half. It's a weird quirk of mine. I don't trust it.
[15:40.510 --> 15:41.050]  I'm not going to fall for the gum bomb.
[15:41.050 --> 15:43.490]  But when it comes to flavor, wouldn't you want the bomb to go off?
[15:45.610 --> 15:48.810]  Yeah, I guess that's a fair point, but I don't trust a flavor bomb.
[15:49.830 --> 15:51.850]  I don't. I don't deal with explosives.
[15:51.850 --> 15:57.370]  After the waffle bomb, I've decidedly am against bombs in my life.
[15:57.910 --> 16:00.070]  You should get your appendix removed immediately then.
[16:00.610 --> 16:02.970]  It's gone already. Already taken care of. Not worried about it.
[16:03.490 --> 16:06.990]  Oh, yeah, you had a bunch of like... I didn't realize it was on the large intestine.
[16:07.130 --> 16:07.610]  That's insane.
[16:07.830 --> 16:10.570]  I think it's unfair if they're going to remove something from your body,
[16:10.630 --> 16:12.070]  you don't get to recoup the space.
[16:12.470 --> 16:13.510]  Like put something there that...
[16:13.510 --> 16:16.270]  Yeah, like you can build a pocket or something that you could store in there.
[16:16.410 --> 16:19.290]  Like you can hold a... that's the size of a USB drive you could stick in there
[16:19.290 --> 16:20.630]  that you'd always have on you if you needed it.
[16:20.630 --> 16:22.410]  Or if you don't have a locker, you can put your drugs there.
[16:22.710 --> 16:23.170]  There you go.
[16:26.730 --> 16:30.270]  Hey, I had an idea a couple of days ago that I haven't talked to.
[16:30.290 --> 16:32.310]  I've only talked to Eric about it. I haven't talked to you guys about it yet.
[16:32.410 --> 16:36.950]  But a long time ago, we... the last time we sold baseballs,
[16:37.010 --> 16:41.110]  there were a handful that got... that bought them.
[16:41.190 --> 16:42.830]  And then for whatever reason, their order fell through
[16:42.830 --> 16:43.950]  and they weren't able to get their baseballs.
[16:44.050 --> 16:46.070]  So we said we'd hit another round for them.
[16:46.630 --> 16:50.330]  And spring... what's it called? Opening days coming up?
[16:50.950 --> 16:51.370]  Opening day.
[16:51.850 --> 16:53.590]  Someone said spring training and baseball.
[16:54.550 --> 16:56.150]  Opening day is coming up pretty soon.
[16:56.830 --> 16:58.430]  And Eric and I were talking about it.
[16:58.470 --> 17:01.410]  And I really want to make good on that promise to those people.
[17:01.770 --> 17:02.570]  And I wouldn't mind.
[17:02.630 --> 17:05.310]  We also still have a bunch of balls that we didn't hit the last time.
[17:05.630 --> 17:07.190]  So I was thinking maybe for opening day,
[17:07.270 --> 17:09.330]  it would be fun to do another round of hitting baseballs.
[17:09.350 --> 17:11.110]  But the angle we could take on it this year,
[17:11.590 --> 17:14.150]  and maybe we do it going forward, is I just hit...
[17:14.150 --> 17:17.570]  we just hit them in whatever the Pantone color of the year is.
[17:17.630 --> 17:20.230]  So they're like of the year 2024.
[17:20.870 --> 17:21.710]  Oh, that's awesome.
[17:22.410 --> 17:23.030]  So great.
[17:23.070 --> 17:25.350]  Whatever the Pantone color of 2024 is.
[17:25.710 --> 17:26.290]  Let's see.
[17:26.370 --> 17:26.950]  What is that?
[17:27.130 --> 17:28.050]  Oh, I love that.
[17:28.590 --> 17:29.350]  Peach fuzz?
[17:29.670 --> 17:30.350]  Peach fuzz.
[17:30.430 --> 17:30.850]  There you go.
[17:31.210 --> 17:33.150]  So what if we get a bunch of peach fuzz paint
[17:33.150 --> 17:35.130]  and then hit a bunch of balls with peach fuzz?
[17:35.270 --> 17:36.250]  I think that sounds great.
[17:36.690 --> 17:38.190]  Okay, I will look better on the front of my camera
[17:38.190 --> 17:39.630]  than the black that we put in last time.
[17:41.430 --> 17:41.950]  You're gonna...
[17:41.950 --> 17:43.390]  we're gonna slowly make...
[17:43.390 --> 17:45.030]  turn your camera into a Jackson Pollock painting.
[17:45.550 --> 17:47.130]  I think Nick has a good question, though.
[17:47.190 --> 17:48.530]  That's the Pantone color of the year.
[17:48.610 --> 17:50.270]  Is there a Pantone color of the year or no?
[17:50.850 --> 17:51.410]  Good question.
[17:52.570 --> 17:53.470]  Pantone color of the year?
[17:54.150 --> 17:55.550]  Surprisingly, peach fuzz.
[17:55.810 --> 17:56.490]  Who would have guessed?
[17:56.910 --> 17:57.870]  Oh, wow, that's actually...
[17:57.870 --> 17:58.350]  what a coincidence.
[17:58.570 --> 17:59.850]  Yeah, it's an alignment this year.
[18:00.330 --> 18:01.090]  It's a rare time.
[18:01.230 --> 18:05.030]  Very rarely aligns, but this year it's an aligned peach fuzz.
[18:05.570 --> 18:07.250]  I think your color of the year is called cop-out.
[18:09.210 --> 18:11.210]  Oh, wow, wow.
[18:11.930 --> 18:12.730]  That's aggressive.
[18:13.230 --> 18:16.090]  You just wait and see what the color of the year is in 2025.
[18:16.550 --> 18:19.290]  And you're gonna be feeling like a fool.
[18:21.990 --> 18:23.570]  Did we intro this episode?
[18:24.470 --> 18:25.690]  No, we'll get to it later.
[18:27.330 --> 18:27.410]  Okay.
[18:28.490 --> 18:30.610]  Hey, I got another question for you guys.
[18:31.010 --> 18:32.130]  The other day...
[18:32.130 --> 18:34.250]  this was a big topic of conversation last night
[18:34.250 --> 18:35.030]  when we were hanging out.
[18:35.030 --> 18:35.790]  I was hanging out with some friends.
[18:36.790 --> 18:39.510]  Down in South Austin, there used to be a sub shop.
[18:39.690 --> 18:41.930]  And I never went there, but I would always drive by it.
[18:42.250 --> 18:45.430]  And it had this giant gorilla holding subs.
[18:45.750 --> 18:48.670]  And every time I saw it, it was never like the right time to eat a sub.
[18:48.830 --> 18:51.410]  But every time I saw it, Emily and I would both go,
[18:51.750 --> 18:54.450]  man, I really want to eat at that gorilla sub place.
[18:54.670 --> 18:56.810]  And we went by it last night, and it was closed.
[18:56.910 --> 18:58.630]  And we realized we missed our window.
[19:00.210 --> 19:02.630]  But as we were talking about it, we got to thinking like,
[19:02.630 --> 19:07.150]  I really do trust a gorilla to deliver a good sub,
[19:07.430 --> 19:08.910]  maybe more than any other animal.
[19:09.290 --> 19:12.350]  Now in my head, I don't know if I did before or if this happened,
[19:12.450 --> 19:14.450]  but I associate subs with gorillas.
[19:14.850 --> 19:18.290]  And if I think of an animal, I want a gorilla to sell me a sub.
[19:18.710 --> 19:22.150]  So we got talking, what other animals should be selling certain foods?
[19:22.210 --> 19:23.030]  Like, who would you...
[19:23.030 --> 19:25.370]  like, what would you trust from a walrus?
[19:25.610 --> 19:27.050]  I would trust clam chowder.
[19:27.490 --> 19:27.610]  Oh.
[19:27.610 --> 19:27.930]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[19:28.070 --> 19:28.410]  Oh.
[19:29.230 --> 19:30.790]  Yeah, clam... that's a great one.
[19:30.790 --> 19:34.910]  I would... honestly, I think a bear could sell me any food.
[19:35.690 --> 19:37.610]  Any food with a bear works for me.
[19:38.190 --> 19:40.810]  Yeah, I was thinking... like, the obvious one is like honey,
[19:41.330 --> 19:45.450]  but I could see a bear selling peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
[19:45.870 --> 19:46.570]  Oh, absolutely.
[19:47.150 --> 19:49.290]  You know, like Uncrustables.
[19:49.890 --> 19:51.430]  You know what? I take that back.
[19:51.510 --> 19:55.030]  I couldn't see a bear selling like a gourmet pizza.
[19:55.430 --> 19:58.630]  Like, it just doesn't... the claws would rip right through the dough.
[19:58.990 --> 20:00.370]  It just... it doesn't work.
[20:00.790 --> 20:02.450]  The functionality isn't there.
[20:03.050 --> 20:05.610]  I'd take a plate of sushi from a crab, I think.
[20:07.310 --> 20:09.330]  Oh, that's a very good one.
[20:09.410 --> 20:12.550]  That's a good one, but don't you think a penguin would look a little... a little better?
[20:14.150 --> 20:15.030]  No, sardines.
[20:15.310 --> 20:16.530]  Penguin's frozen yogurt, dude.
[20:16.970 --> 20:18.570]  Oh, penguin could be frozen yogurt.
[20:18.830 --> 20:19.570]  Yeah, ice cream.
[20:20.010 --> 20:23.990]  If I'm going by Who Framed Roger Rabbit rules, I assume the penguin is dealing with the drinks.
[20:25.110 --> 20:25.830]  That's a good call.
[20:27.150 --> 20:30.050]  Nick said a giraffe would... he'd buy a salad from a giraffe.
[20:30.930 --> 20:32.950]  Gracie would take pancakes from a kangaroo.
[20:33.810 --> 20:35.050]  Pancakes from a kangaroo?
[20:35.330 --> 20:36.230]  Yeah, why is that?
[20:37.250 --> 20:39.170]  I don't know, it just seems trustworthy.
[20:40.030 --> 20:41.270]  Flapjack, kangaroo jack.
[20:41.450 --> 20:42.750]  I can see it. I can see it.
[20:42.850 --> 20:46.390]  I feel like a smoothie for a kangaroo for me.
[20:46.710 --> 20:48.650]  In my head, I'm processing now.
[20:49.130 --> 20:53.930]  Whatever it is, I need to be able to imagine the animal holding it or like creating it.
[20:54.130 --> 20:54.730]  Oh, absolutely.
[20:55.150 --> 20:55.330]  Yeah.
[20:55.410 --> 20:55.790]  So like...
[20:56.490 --> 20:57.190]  Like a spaghetti squid?
[20:57.190 --> 20:59.950]  Maybe a kangaroo... yeah, sure.
[20:59.950 --> 21:01.030]  That could work.
[21:01.470 --> 21:02.790]  I just can't see...
[21:03.730 --> 21:07.730]  I can't... well, I guess like a kangaroo jumps makes wine, right?
[21:07.790 --> 21:09.330]  Like crushes the grapes.
[21:09.330 --> 21:10.130]  Oh, that would be good.
[21:10.230 --> 21:11.150]  He can bounce on the grapes.
[21:11.470 --> 21:13.990]  Yeah, I'm trying to think like functionality.
[21:15.230 --> 21:16.610]  An octopus would do hibachi.
[21:17.750 --> 21:18.430]  Oh, that's great.
[21:18.670 --> 21:19.890]  That's a really good one.
[21:20.590 --> 21:21.190]  That's a really good one.
[21:21.190 --> 21:23.170]  So it sounds like you wouldn't take anything from a slug.
[21:24.690 --> 21:25.170]  Escargot.
[21:25.610 --> 21:25.850]  Salt.
[21:26.310 --> 21:29.010]  Yeah, I would... yeah, unfortunately.
[21:29.370 --> 21:29.510]  Salt?
[21:30.370 --> 21:31.950]  The thing that kills him?
[21:37.680 --> 21:38.080]  Oh, anyway.
[21:38.560 --> 21:39.740]  Oh, well, there you go. That's perfect.
[21:42.080 --> 21:42.960]  I was...
[21:42.960 --> 21:44.200]  Oh, what was...
[21:44.200 --> 21:46.700]  What would you eat that a wolf offered?
[21:47.840 --> 21:49.780]  Oh, like raw meat?
[21:50.000 --> 21:50.760]  Yeah, like steak.
[21:50.860 --> 21:52.300]  Yeah, like beef jerky.
[21:53.100 --> 21:53.420]  Yeah.
[21:53.700 --> 21:54.140]  Jerky's good.
[21:54.460 --> 21:56.420]  No, jerky's like a moose food to me.
[21:56.700 --> 21:58.200]  Oh, yeah, I can see that.
[21:58.200 --> 21:59.820]  Like a moose would be doing jerky.
[22:00.480 --> 22:00.680]  Yeah.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.720]  I wouldn't buy anything from a salmon.
[22:04.180 --> 22:07.560]  And that's even... I'm allergic, so like that's a side point to it.
[22:07.760 --> 22:13.500]  But when I imagine a salmon trying to sell any food, it's like Jack Lemmon in...
[22:13.500 --> 22:17.520]  And what was the selling movie with Alec Baldwin?
[22:19.260 --> 22:21.120]  Oh, Glengarry Glen Ross?
[22:21.400 --> 22:22.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[22:22.260 --> 22:27.100]  His character, you know, like just this sad salesman that can't do anything at the end of his...
[22:27.100 --> 22:28.780]  That's what a salmon is to me.
[22:29.060 --> 22:29.800]  Like Gil from The Simpsons?
[22:30.400 --> 22:33.860]  Yeah, like Gil, exactly. That is a better comparable.
[22:34.060 --> 22:34.540]  Oh, yeah.
[22:34.940 --> 22:38.180]  I just don't... you can't... the salmon isn't selling me anything.
[22:38.380 --> 22:40.520]  I don't trust it. I don't think it's good.
[22:41.120 --> 22:45.820]  I think a fox could sell me tricky spicy noodles.
[22:46.360 --> 22:49.000]  That like, they don't look like they're gonna be spicy.
[22:49.200 --> 22:53.000]  You eat them and you're like, oh, I got tricked by the fox who sold me these spicy noodles.
[22:54.120 --> 22:56.180]  That tracks... regular noodles? I don't know.
[22:56.340 --> 22:57.760]  Spicy noodles? That's a fox food.
[22:58.300 --> 23:00.720]  Horse, horse sells trail mix, right?
[23:05.020 --> 23:06.100]  That's a good one.
[23:06.560 --> 23:07.560]  That's really good.
[23:07.880 --> 23:10.540]  Some of these are from people came up with last night that I'm just remembering now.
[23:11.700 --> 23:13.680]  You know, Geoff, how you ate those boiled peanuts?
[23:14.420 --> 23:14.600]  Yeah.
[23:15.180 --> 23:15.940]  Who would give you them?
[23:16.740 --> 23:17.560]  Oh, alligator.
[23:17.820 --> 23:18.340]  I got one.
[23:19.280 --> 23:21.560]  Yeah, alligator. No, it's a, it's a, it's a...
[23:21.560 --> 23:23.720]  That's a donkey food. A donkey would...
[23:23.720 --> 23:24.250]  Oh, that's...
[23:24.760 --> 23:27.580]  A donkey would suck boiled peanuts? That's donkey food, dude.
[23:27.580 --> 23:29.080]  Donkeys don't sell boiled peanuts.
[23:29.400 --> 23:30.340]  That's such a donkey food.
[23:30.400 --> 23:31.080]  No, I agree with that.
[23:31.280 --> 23:33.780]  Elephants sell peanuts, first of all.
[23:33.860 --> 23:34.520]  That's an idiot.
[23:34.520 --> 23:36.320]  Boiled peanuts is a donkey food.
[23:36.320 --> 23:41.540]  I'm telling you a bayou gator with a cowboy hat on that's all rolled up
[23:41.540 --> 23:45.900]  with a little bit of, with a peanut shell in his mouth and a Cajun accent.
[23:46.660 --> 23:50.900]  The elephant hands off the peanuts to the gator for the boiling process.
[23:51.620 --> 23:54.740]  I think that the gator is selling me catfish.
[23:55.100 --> 23:55.840]  That, yes.
[23:56.320 --> 23:59.020]  That's why boiled peanut is donkey food, dude.
[24:00.100 --> 24:03.360]  Yeah. I feel like a squirrel is selling gourmet nuts.
[24:03.840 --> 24:04.020]  Maybe.
[24:04.200 --> 24:08.080]  It's something trashy about like a donkey with the, the boiled nuts.
[24:08.100 --> 24:09.480]  Like it just, it's, it fits.
[24:09.940 --> 24:13.680]  Does it bother you that animals don't have names and no, and they're not really anything?
[24:14.160 --> 24:14.580]  What do you mean?
[24:14.800 --> 24:17.300]  Well, just that humans named all the animals, but they don't,
[24:17.980 --> 24:20.280]  they're not actually that, and they don't know each other as that.
[24:21.900 --> 24:25.640]  No. I mean, that's never, that hasn't bothered me, nor have I thought it,
[24:25.640 --> 24:27.040]  I think that's a very funny thought.
[24:27.060 --> 24:30.400]  I don't, I don't think you're allowed to have, I don't think you're allowed to have that thought
[24:30.400 --> 24:35.620]  after I got just undressed for thinking that horses think they're in the middle ages.
[24:37.600 --> 24:40.480]  They actually live in the middle ages because they work
[24:43.260 --> 24:45.360]  at that fucking medieval times we went to.
[24:45.500 --> 24:49.340]  You're not allowed to think that animals are annoyed at people being called the wrong name.
[24:50.900 --> 24:57.360]  I'm glad, Geoff, that you like the sub gorilla, that that's the thing that brings you joy.
[24:57.940 --> 25:03.220]  I have a dumb bit in my head where there is a car dealer that has like a giant,
[25:03.280 --> 25:08.940]  like reptar, like a dinosaur type thing inflatable on top of it.
[25:09.040 --> 25:14.020]  And I've created this bit in my head that makes me laugh every time I drive by it,
[25:14.160 --> 25:17.440]  where it's the idea of this guy who really wants to buy a car,
[25:17.440 --> 25:20.320]  but he thinks that the monster is real, so he can't.
[25:20.420 --> 25:24.500]  So, like, he drives up to it and is like, oh, my God, it's a dinosaur.
[25:24.800 --> 25:29.520]  Oh, fuck. And it's like every time he drives by, that's the it's like, again,
[25:29.620 --> 25:35.540]  why haven't they dealt with this? What? I need a car. I need a car now. God damn it.
[25:36.120 --> 25:39.600]  So the idea, the sub is the same thing. I like the idea of this person who really
[25:39.600 --> 25:41.900]  wants to eat one of those subs, but he's scared of the gorilla.
[25:42.300 --> 25:46.460]  Yeah, dude, I'm the opposite. I want I would I'd run up and hug that gorilla if I met him.
[25:46.460 --> 25:51.340]  I want I've never wanted anything more than I want a sandwich from that gorilla.
[25:51.620 --> 25:56.460]  And I'm so bummed we we did we you see it in out in the world and you think that makes total sense.
[25:56.900 --> 25:58.800]  Gorilla selling subs that'll always be there.
[25:59.100 --> 26:01.940]  And you take it for granted. And then before you know it, the world changes.
[26:02.500 --> 26:05.220]  So were you always going by this gorilla at like 9 a.m.?
[26:05.220 --> 26:07.020]  Like, what was the wrong time for a sub?
[26:07.020 --> 26:10.100]  Just always like it's like four in the afternoon. You're headed to
[26:10.660 --> 26:13.200]  the mall to pick something up and you just drive by and you go,
[26:13.280 --> 26:16.280]  oh, next time we eat lunch over here, let's go get at the gorilla sub.
[26:16.280 --> 26:21.960]  It was like over by the Best Buy down at like, I don't know, Mopac and Brody or something.
[26:22.540 --> 26:27.040]  And I just like I just it was always like it's in a shopping center that you have to like,
[26:27.260 --> 26:29.120]  you have to put effort into getting to, you know,
[26:29.140 --> 26:31.020]  it's one of those ones where it's got like a weird off ramp.
[26:31.500 --> 26:35.120]  And so there's now the Juiceland gorilla. That's great, too.
[26:35.380 --> 26:37.160]  I definitely would drink a smoothie from...
[26:38.240 --> 26:40.500]  I would buy drugs from the Juiceland gorilla.
[26:42.120 --> 26:44.340]  A hundred percent, dude. Absolutely.
[26:44.340 --> 26:47.280]  That Juiceland gorilla would sell you drugs right now.
[26:49.140 --> 26:50.300]  It's what's in the crown.
[26:50.640 --> 26:52.660]  Well, what would be the best drug dealing animal?
[26:52.880 --> 26:56.380]  Like if you had to take drugs from an animal, I think a weasel.
[26:56.920 --> 27:01.200]  Oh, I think the kangaroo has that pouch and it has some utility.
[27:01.620 --> 27:04.360]  You don't know what's in there. It's got room to look around.
[27:04.620 --> 27:05.500]  It gives you change.
[27:05.920 --> 27:07.940]  You know what? It's donkey.
[27:08.500 --> 27:09.560]  It's a mule. No, it's not.
[27:09.780 --> 27:12.020]  Yes, it's donkey. The best drug animal.
[27:12.020 --> 27:15.500]  That carries it, but that doesn't sell it.
[27:15.700 --> 27:17.040]  No, I think it's a koala.
[27:17.620 --> 27:18.380]  I think it's a koala.
[27:18.540 --> 27:23.140]  They also have a pouch and they're fucked up like 18 hours a day on eucalyptus.
[27:23.220 --> 27:26.540]  They're always high. They always have like weed vision eyes.
[27:26.720 --> 27:28.740]  They're always like, hey, they're always fucking hungry.
[27:28.920 --> 27:30.000]  They're always munching on stuff.
[27:30.020 --> 27:31.540]  Don't they have like insanely smooth brains?
[27:31.880 --> 27:33.920]  Like aren't koalas like so dumb?
[27:33.960 --> 27:35.300]  Because yeah, they're fucked up.
[27:35.300 --> 27:37.580]  Yeah, like really cubulous shits.
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.660]  I knew a guy in middle school that was like a koala.
[27:40.660 --> 27:42.840]  He was high 24 hours a day.
[27:43.140 --> 27:45.160]  We were watching his brain smooth out.
[27:45.280 --> 27:47.460]  And there were there were bets like he's not gonna make it to 10th grade, right?
[27:47.540 --> 27:48.620]  And I was like, no, there's no way.
[27:49.120 --> 27:53.640]  If you did the anamorphs on the Brad Pitt character in True Romance, it's a koala.
[27:53.880 --> 27:57.940]  So I don't know if they're selling, but it's like that's that person.
[28:00.300 --> 28:01.920]  It's that personality type.
[28:03.120 --> 28:04.480]  I don't know if I trust him as a dealer.
[28:05.240 --> 28:06.580]  I can't get through that movie.
[28:07.640 --> 28:07.960]  Yeah.
[28:07.960 --> 28:08.260]  Yeah.
[28:09.080 --> 28:10.680]  Yeah, it's one of those movies.
[28:10.800 --> 28:13.060]  I've seen the first 45 minutes several times.
[28:13.960 --> 28:16.400]  I watched Drexel's dick get blown off.
[28:16.520 --> 28:19.940]  And then I just because I just turned it off for some reason.
[28:20.520 --> 28:22.880]  Drexel is one of the coolest characters ever, though.
[28:23.280 --> 28:24.800]  I disagree strongly.
[28:24.960 --> 28:26.640]  I think Drexel kind of sucks as a character.
[28:26.660 --> 28:28.700]  He does, but the fact that that's Gary Oldman.
[28:29.160 --> 28:30.760]  Like what a performance, dude.
[28:31.600 --> 28:33.660]  Is that a role that he would take these days?
[28:34.080 --> 28:35.060]  No, I don't think so.
[28:35.160 --> 28:37.580]  But like he fucking he fucking nailed it.
[28:37.580 --> 28:38.620]  He's retired now, right?
[28:38.660 --> 28:39.180]  Isn't he retiring?
[28:39.420 --> 28:39.680]  Is he?
[28:39.800 --> 28:41.680]  Well, that's too bad.
[28:42.260 --> 28:43.480]  He just done some weird stuff.
[28:43.900 --> 28:47.980]  He was a great version of Satan in a car commercial.
[28:48.200 --> 28:50.940]  I don't remember that was directed by.
[28:51.860 --> 28:52.500]  Who directed?
[28:52.640 --> 28:53.560]  I don't I don't remember who.
[28:53.660 --> 28:55.460]  It's one of the all time great commercials.
[28:56.040 --> 28:57.860]  It's Clive Owen and him.
[28:58.080 --> 29:00.260]  And I want to say Danny Trejo.
[29:00.680 --> 29:04.280]  And it's all about James Brown sold his soul to the devil.
[29:04.500 --> 29:06.160]  But now that he's growing old,
[29:06.160 --> 29:07.700]  he can't like the contract.
[29:07.800 --> 29:10.820]  It was for fame and he can't be famous because he can't dance anymore.
[29:11.040 --> 29:13.520]  And so they race to it.
[29:13.600 --> 29:15.000]  I think it's a Tony Scott commercial.
[29:15.580 --> 29:17.960]  It's great, but he does some weird stuff.
[29:18.080 --> 29:19.740]  I'm saying like it's not out of his range.
[29:20.100 --> 29:22.720]  Hey, have you guys ever seen this all time great commercial?
[29:23.700 --> 29:26.520]  No, I mean, maybe I don't think so.
[29:26.580 --> 29:27.180]  Fantastic commercial.
[29:27.360 --> 29:28.200]  It was like a run.
[29:28.380 --> 29:30.020]  It was a car commercial.
[29:30.140 --> 29:35.320]  They took like seven or eight famous directors and they had to make like short films around.
[29:36.300 --> 29:37.020]  The car.
[29:37.820 --> 29:39.200]  And so Gary Oldman played the devil.
[29:39.820 --> 29:41.240]  Gary Oldman plays the devil.
[29:41.400 --> 29:44.860]  And it's a very like ridiculous over the top performance by him.
[29:45.100 --> 29:45.260]  It's great.
[29:45.340 --> 29:48.080]  Who do you who do you think has played the devil the best?
[29:50.400 --> 29:51.920]  Didn't Tim Curry do a good devil?
[29:53.740 --> 29:54.880]  In what was that?
[29:54.900 --> 29:55.360]  A legend?
[29:55.600 --> 29:55.940]  A legend.
[29:56.400 --> 29:56.760]  Yeah.
[29:56.820 --> 29:57.600]  Was he the devil in that?
[29:57.900 --> 29:59.220]  Well, he was a demon for sure.
[29:59.400 --> 30:00.700]  Oh, I don't know if he was the devil.
[30:00.880 --> 30:02.460]  I saw that movie when I was a kid.
[30:02.480 --> 30:03.560]  I don't really remember it very well.
[30:04.640 --> 30:09.120]  I thought Peter Stormare was awesome as the devil in Constantine.
[30:09.780 --> 30:11.300]  Anytime I think of the devil now,
[30:11.440 --> 30:14.540]  I think of he's the first thing that pops up as Peter Stormare in that role.
[30:14.960 --> 30:18.020]  What about was De Niro the devil in Angel Heart?
[30:18.020 --> 30:18.960]  Yeah, he was.
[30:19.040 --> 30:20.720]  I was about to say, who do you think played the worst devil?
[30:20.900 --> 30:22.680]  That would be De Niro in Angel Heart for me.
[30:23.080 --> 30:25.860]  He is the only time I've ever seen De Niro in a movie be bad.
[30:26.300 --> 30:27.160]  I haven't seen it.
[30:27.340 --> 30:29.940]  So I just I feel like that's when I hear about a lot.
[30:30.180 --> 30:33.220]  I'm having a hard time thinking of other known devil performances.
[30:33.560 --> 30:35.220]  Dave Grohl, the devil or just a demon?
[30:35.580 --> 30:36.560]  I think he might have been the devil.
[30:37.140 --> 30:41.740]  Oh, John Lovitz played a great devil on the People's Court episode of Saturday Night Live.
[30:42.660 --> 30:43.120]  That skit.
[30:44.660 --> 30:46.540]  Did he wear like the red suit?
[30:46.740 --> 30:50.100]  He did. Maybe I'll switch from Peter Stormare to John Lovitz.
[30:50.360 --> 30:52.280]  John Lovitz might be the best devil.
[30:52.680 --> 30:52.820]  Yeah.
[30:57.950 --> 31:00.230]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[31:00.630 --> 31:03.750]  When it comes to relationships in your life,
[31:03.750 --> 31:07.330]  I know certainly in mine, they often require work,
[31:09.030 --> 31:15.790]  understanding, talking to someone or just personal evaluation in a lot of ways.
[31:16.130 --> 31:22.090]  It's something that it's important to, in my experience, get professional help
[31:22.090 --> 31:29.810]  when dealing with relationships that may be toxic or that are you're struggling with,
[31:29.810 --> 31:34.510]  whether it be personal or it could even be a work thing.
[31:34.670 --> 31:39.550]  Just being able to talk to somebody about things that you're going through and
[31:40.450 --> 31:44.890]  conflict you may be having or just even like maybe potentially why
[31:44.890 --> 31:49.910]  you're not connecting the way that you intend to because it could be a complicated,
[31:50.150 --> 31:54.550]  people are messy, social situations can be difficult.
[31:55.030 --> 31:57.510]  It's just it's a lot to navigate.
[31:58.250 --> 32:02.990]  So a common misconception about relationships is that they have to be easy to be right.
[32:03.130 --> 32:07.010]  But sometimes the best ones happen when both people put in the work to make them great,
[32:07.150 --> 32:09.910]  which is something that I have experienced in my personal life.
[32:11.770 --> 32:17.450]  It is really wonderful to know that even if a relationship is maybe not in a great place,
[32:18.050 --> 32:22.150]  it is possible to get it there as long as both parties are willing to put the work in to
[32:22.670 --> 32:23.710]  bridge that gap.
[32:24.370 --> 32:26.970]  Therapy can be a place to work through the challenges you face in all of your
[32:26.970 --> 32:30.590]  relationships, whether friends, work, your significant other, or anyone.
[32:31.230 --> 32:34.610]  Therapy is something I talk about all the time is having a tremendous impact in my life.
[32:34.710 --> 32:37.110]  I think it's a really healthy process to go through.
[32:37.430 --> 32:39.630]  So I would highly recommend it to anyone.
[32:39.890 --> 32:42.950]  So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.

[33:07.110 --> 33:08.330]  You know what you don't want to be?
[33:08.730 --> 33:09.170]  Smelly.
[33:09.610 --> 33:10.750]  No one likes being smelly.
[33:11.210 --> 33:14.770]  No one enjoys having to deal with smell when it's bad.
[33:14.990 --> 33:16.050]  You only want good smell.
[33:16.450 --> 33:18.870]  But actually what you want to smell like is a zero.
[33:19.370 --> 33:22.230]  And you might be saying, Andrew, isn't a zero a bad thing?
[33:22.230 --> 33:26.210]  No, let me explain about Mando and their whole body deodorant.
[33:26.330 --> 33:31.170]  They did a clinical study and men who showered with soap and used Mando whole body deodorant
[33:31.170 --> 33:36.090]  in their pits had an odor score of 0 out of 10 after 12 hours.
[33:36.210 --> 33:36.650]  No odor.
[33:37.310 --> 33:38.870]  No odor at all.
[33:39.530 --> 33:45.070]  Men who showered with soap alone had an armpit odor score of 8 out of 10 after 12 hours.
[33:45.370 --> 33:45.990]  That's big odor.
[33:46.330 --> 33:47.890]  You don't want big odor.
[33:48.110 --> 33:49.570]  Big odor, no good.
[33:49.570 --> 33:55.070]  And that's why I'm here today to introduce Mando from the makers of Lume deodorant.
[33:55.830 --> 34:00.550]  Mando is a clinically proven to control odor for 72 hours wherever you stink,
[34:01.090 --> 34:04.050]  whether it be your pits, package, feet and beyond.
[34:04.350 --> 34:07.490]  Any stinky area, Mando's got you covered.
[34:08.310 --> 34:13.010]  So make the switch to Mando whole body deodorant and smell like a zero every day.
[34:13.230 --> 34:15.850]  Don't have to worry about where you are on the chart.
[34:16.350 --> 34:17.470]  Nobody wants to be on that chart.
[34:17.970 --> 34:19.010]  Not a fun chart.
[34:19.010 --> 34:19.930]  It'd be stressful.
[34:20.350 --> 34:24.250]  Be sweaty and smelly because you're like, I don't know with this product.
[34:24.790 --> 34:25.630]  Where am I on the chart?
[34:25.710 --> 34:29.690]  But with Mando, you know, you're going to be a zero on that chart.
[34:30.010 --> 34:31.470]  Let me tell you about some of the products they have.
[34:31.470 --> 34:32.910]  They have the Mando Starter Pack.
[34:33.290 --> 34:35.830]  It's a perfect pack for new customers.

[35:16.430 --> 35:22.750]  Speaking of subs and juices, I had my first streaming disaster.
[35:23.210 --> 35:24.170]  What's funny, Gavin?
[35:24.350 --> 35:27.550]  I'm looking at this fucking gorilla drink a giant thing of juice.
[35:27.830 --> 35:28.430]  No, you're right.
[35:28.590 --> 35:29.690]  It was a funny sentence.
[35:29.770 --> 35:30.210]  I liked it.
[35:30.730 --> 35:34.290]  Uh, have you heard of Robinson's Orange, Gavin?
[35:34.470 --> 35:36.990]  It's a, it's a UK beverage.
[35:37.510 --> 35:38.310]  Like an orange squash?
[35:39.110 --> 35:43.090]  Uh, no, it's like, uh, maybe Eric, could you pull up an image of it?
[35:43.090 --> 35:48.090]  It is, uh, it says on the side of it, appointment to queen manufacturers.
[35:48.390 --> 35:50.390]  That, so I've been streaming.
[35:50.870 --> 35:51.490]  That's orange squash.
[35:52.690 --> 35:53.810]  Ah, yes.
[35:54.050 --> 35:54.310]  Okay.
[35:54.630 --> 35:56.310]  I didn't know, I didn't know that.
[35:56.370 --> 35:57.730]  And I still don't know that, apparently.
[35:58.290 --> 36:02.150]  I, uh, have been streaming quite a bit and trying different juices.
[36:02.890 --> 36:04.930]  And I saw that in a store.
[36:05.290 --> 36:06.950]  You didn't just go for it, did you?
[36:07.190 --> 36:08.410]  That looks great.
[36:08.550 --> 36:10.650]  That looks like an orange type thing.
[36:10.730 --> 36:12.110]  I've tried orange juice.
[36:12.530 --> 36:14.610]  Let's, let's try to stream this.
[36:14.810 --> 36:17.630]  And it was, uh, right before I had a meeting.
[36:17.750 --> 36:20.070]  And I was like, oh, I could use a drink.
[36:20.130 --> 36:21.030]  Let's get this going.
[36:21.170 --> 36:21.910]  I was all excited.
[36:22.230 --> 36:24.130]  I had it in the fridge for a few days.
[36:24.770 --> 36:31.370]  And, uh, I streamed a whole, I streamed 850 milliliters of, uh, Robinson's Orange.
[36:31.870 --> 36:34.050]  Took a sip and did not like it.
[36:34.110 --> 36:36.170]  It was, it was very strong.
[36:36.590 --> 36:37.990]  It, it was, uh, kind of orange.
[36:38.050 --> 36:39.890]  It was just a weird taste.
[36:40.550 --> 36:41.930]  Uh, wasn't a fan.
[36:42.110 --> 36:46.350]  And then I, I just gave it to my partner and said, try this.
[36:46.550 --> 36:48.090]  I don't, I don't like it.
[36:48.110 --> 36:48.610]  And they tried it.
[36:48.670 --> 36:51.250]  They're like, is this, what do you say with squash, Gavin?
[36:51.530 --> 36:52.210]  Yeah, orange squash.
[36:52.570 --> 36:53.830]  Yeah, I didn't know.
[36:54.190 --> 36:59.250]  So I guess essentially this is like the concentrate of...
[36:59.250 --> 37:03.190]  That, that, that bottle there, that's enough for probably 60 liters of drink.
[37:03.590 --> 37:07.290]  Like, you die, you die like the shit out of it.
[37:07.290 --> 37:12.210]  So you couldn't pour like a centimeter into a huge glass and just make a whole,
[37:12.250 --> 37:13.950]  add water and make a whole lot.
[37:14.510 --> 37:17.530]  And for like explanation of what would make sense to me,
[37:17.750 --> 37:22.510]  I essentially carbonated grenadine and then tried to drink it is sort of the idea.
[37:23.830 --> 37:29.010]  It, I got laughed at so hard for, for not noticing because on the front of the bottle,
[37:29.090 --> 37:31.830]  it says dilute me in like a pleading way.
[37:31.890 --> 37:33.070]  I just didn't notice it.
[37:33.070 --> 37:39.630]  And then on the side, on the side, it says it's a four to one water ratio.
[37:39.930 --> 37:43.630]  One part this concentrate to water.
[37:44.290 --> 37:46.410]  I would say four to one is even pretty strong.
[37:48.010 --> 37:52.770]  It's, uh, if you encounter that, if you've been streaming because of the show,
[37:53.390 --> 37:55.370]  be careful with the Robinson's orange.
[37:55.650 --> 38:00.870]  Because I now, I have a 750 milliliter carbonated thing of Robinson's orange
[38:00.870 --> 38:02.790]  that I don't know how to distribute.
[38:03.390 --> 38:07.790]  Out of that, like, do I carbonate the water as well?
[38:07.930 --> 38:10.470]  Do I just add the carbonated Robinson's orange to?
[38:10.610 --> 38:11.270]  I just don't.
[38:11.490 --> 38:13.610]  I would add it to already carbonated water.
[38:14.070 --> 38:19.210]  I think that's the move, but it's just I've been staring at this carbonated bottle of
[38:19.210 --> 38:21.390]  mix essentially or concentrate.
[38:21.690 --> 38:24.190]  And it's been a disaster.
[38:24.590 --> 38:27.890]  It's my first big loss in the streaming game.
[38:28.570 --> 38:31.570]  Speaking of disasters, I don't think I've mentioned this to anybody yet.
[38:31.690 --> 38:32.190]  Maybe I have.
[38:32.190 --> 38:36.850]  But, uh, on Sunday, my tooth just fell out of my mouth.
[38:37.190 --> 38:38.450]  Oh, my good God.
[38:38.830 --> 38:39.890]  What do you mean?
[38:40.050 --> 38:40.970]  Oh, God.
[38:41.010 --> 38:44.350]  I was eating Mike and Ike candy.
[38:44.710 --> 38:47.790]  And I just took a bite of a piece of Mike and Ike.
[38:48.030 --> 38:49.110]  And I heard a weird noise.
[38:49.190 --> 38:51.070]  And then a tooth just came out of my mouth.
[38:51.470 --> 38:52.290]  The whole thing?
[38:52.810 --> 38:54.070]  No, it was a crown.
[38:54.330 --> 38:55.610]  But it was most of a tooth.
[38:55.870 --> 38:58.250]  And so I just had like a little weird, like, nub.
[38:58.430 --> 39:01.270]  Kind of like when Darth Vader takes off his helmet for the first time.
[39:01.270 --> 39:02.690]  And you see, like, what's left of his head.
[39:03.030 --> 39:03.790]  Like, kind of like that.
[39:03.910 --> 39:05.410]  It was like, that's what my tooth felt like.
[39:05.730 --> 39:08.510]  I think we are at the 15th anniversary of the taffy incident.
[39:08.810 --> 39:09.250]  So maybe it's...
[39:09.250 --> 39:11.730]  So, so here, here we go.
[39:12.090 --> 39:13.250]  So I freaked out.
[39:13.350 --> 39:14.210]  There was no pain or anything.
[39:14.210 --> 39:17.850]  But, you know, I have such anxiety related to dental stuff now.
[39:18.310 --> 39:19.190]  That Emily had...
[39:19.190 --> 39:19.570]  Stop eating candy then!
[39:20.090 --> 39:21.850]  Emily just had one Mike and Ike.
[39:22.310 --> 39:24.410]  And I even bought it because I thought, well, this isn't too chewy.
[39:24.510 --> 39:25.270]  I'm probably fine with this.
[39:25.550 --> 39:26.810]  Mike and Ike is so chewy.
[39:27.330 --> 39:28.330]  Millie was eating taffy.
[39:28.390 --> 39:30.430]  And I was like, no way in hell I'm ever touching taffy again.
[39:31.350 --> 39:33.550]  And I'm like, my taffy days are long gone.
[39:34.070 --> 39:36.890]  And so I fucking got so upset.
[39:37.070 --> 39:41.530]  And so just, like, freaked out because I've just had so much, you know, trauma related to it.
[39:41.870 --> 39:43.850]  Emily had to give me, like, a Valium to calm me down.
[39:44.030 --> 39:45.550]  And then the first thing in the morning,
[39:45.550 --> 39:48.630]  I just went to the dentist as they were opening and called them.
[39:48.750 --> 39:50.970]  And it was like, hey, my tooth fell out, blah, blah, blah.
[39:51.110 --> 39:51.990]  I got to come in and get it.
[39:52.030 --> 39:53.970]  I just got to get my crown glued back in.
[39:54.110 --> 39:55.850]  And they're like, well, we're pretty busy.
[39:55.970 --> 39:57.530]  And then they're like, wait, which tooth is it?
[39:57.530 --> 39:58.730]  And I told them where I thought it was.
[39:58.770 --> 40:01.250]  And they're like, is that the crown we just put on?
[40:01.250 --> 40:02.310]  A month ago?
[40:02.750 --> 40:04.090]  And I was like, yes, it is.
[40:04.350 --> 40:04.950]  I had no idea.
[40:05.590 --> 40:07.850]  And they were like, well, you better get in right now then.
[40:08.030 --> 40:11.410]  And so I was there for an hour and a half because they were very kind to fit me in.
[40:11.910 --> 40:15.090]  But when they finally sat me down and they got in there and they looked at it,
[40:15.230 --> 40:17.130]  the dentist goes, I didn't put this crown in.
[40:17.350 --> 40:18.770]  This has got to be at least 10 years old.
[40:19.270 --> 40:23.310]  And I realized, Gavin, it was the crown I got from the Laffy Taffy.
[40:23.490 --> 40:24.570]  It finally fell out.
[40:26.330 --> 40:29.450]  The very first crown popped out 15 years later.
[40:29.450 --> 40:31.170]  And they just glued it back in.
[40:31.210 --> 40:31.890]  And it was fine.
[40:32.010 --> 40:32.690]  It was totally fine.
[40:32.790 --> 40:34.870]  She's like, well, I don't like this crown, but it already exists.
[40:34.950 --> 40:35.550]  And it should be fine.
[40:35.690 --> 40:36.130]  Put it back in.
[40:36.470 --> 40:38.410]  God, I laughed so hard.
[40:38.670 --> 40:40.610]  Oh, that was longer than because I think it was 2007.
[40:40.930 --> 40:42.350]  Yeah, probably 2007.
[40:42.510 --> 40:43.150]  That sounds about right.
[40:43.250 --> 40:47.890]  And you they wouldn't have fit me in if they thought it was if they knew it was not their crown.
[40:48.090 --> 40:51.690]  Because they were like, they were like, they thought it popped up after a month.
[40:52.110 --> 40:53.790]  They were like, holy shit, we really fucked up.
[40:54.030 --> 40:57.690]  Long enough to like fully live through the lifespan of your dental work.
[40:58.670 --> 40:59.310]  Full cycle.
[40:59.610 --> 41:01.990]  I got to say, though, it happened at like eight o'clock at night.
[41:02.250 --> 41:04.870]  And then I was fixed by nine thirty in the morning.
[41:05.010 --> 41:08.730]  So it was like a 13 hour ordeal with zero pain at any point.
[41:08.870 --> 41:11.010]  And if you're going to have a dental issue, that's the way to do it.
[41:11.290 --> 41:15.910]  But I just thought it was funny that it finally that it turns out it was the crown.
[41:16.110 --> 41:16.770]  The very first crown.
[41:17.430 --> 41:18.510]  And what have you learned?
[41:18.970 --> 41:21.030]  That a crown will last you about 15 years.
[41:21.110 --> 41:22.690]  Like in about 15 years, I'll take it.
[41:22.730 --> 41:25.290]  I'll take it easy on the Mike and Ikes because these crowns will be ready to pop out.
[41:25.530 --> 41:27.630]  Now, do you think it was Mike or Ike that took the crown out?
[41:28.170 --> 41:30.290]  Or was it maybe a combined effort?
[41:30.850 --> 41:32.010]  It wasn't even good.
[41:32.850 --> 41:33.810]  I like Mike and Ike.
[41:34.010 --> 41:35.930]  I bought this fucking... no, I like Mike and Ike.
[41:36.030 --> 41:39.490]  I bought this tropical... like this tropical version.
[41:40.230 --> 41:43.550]  And some of the flavors are good, but some of them are really bad.
[41:43.610 --> 41:46.970]  And I was trying to figure out what the flavor was that sucked.
[41:47.050 --> 41:48.010]  I think it was some kind of coconut.
[41:48.250 --> 41:49.210]  But I do like coconut.
[41:49.350 --> 41:50.210]  But this was dog shit.
[41:50.590 --> 41:52.650]  And so I even lost on a bad flavor.
[41:56.810 --> 42:02.090]  I have a new dumb problem in my life that might go on for a month.
[42:02.170 --> 42:03.410]  I'm not sure when it will.
[42:03.510 --> 42:04.790]  It's going to extend for a while.
[42:05.170 --> 42:11.610]  My Geoff's favorite phone, the Umi Digi, his brand of choice, has passed.
[42:11.950 --> 42:12.630]  It's dead.
[42:12.830 --> 42:14.230]  No more crazy photos.
[42:14.750 --> 42:15.630]  It's gone.
[42:16.190 --> 42:18.330]  How do you go through the phones?
[42:19.490 --> 42:20.710]  I don't understand.
[42:21.730 --> 42:22.630]  You want to know how the Umi Digi works?
[42:22.630 --> 42:23.190]  Yeah.
[42:23.790 --> 42:27.970]  I was feeling really sick and I had a bath.
[42:28.210 --> 42:32.350]  And it's the first time I've ever fallen asleep with the phone in my hand in the tub.
[42:32.470 --> 42:37.010]  And I was alerted to it thudding off the bottom and went into full panic.
[42:37.250 --> 42:40.670]  And it turns out the Umi Digi is not a waterproof phone.
[42:41.130 --> 42:43.630]  It is my burner phone.
[42:44.570 --> 42:46.790]  It could not handle the water.
[42:46.950 --> 42:47.990]  It was truly a burner.
[42:49.610 --> 42:50.610]  Put it out.
[42:50.610 --> 42:53.410]  But the next day it worked.
[42:53.630 --> 42:55.010]  And I was like, oh, this is great.
[42:55.070 --> 42:56.810]  I don't need to look at a new phone.
[42:57.150 --> 42:57.790]  This is awesome.
[42:58.610 --> 43:02.470]  But then the screen progressively died further and further.
[43:02.570 --> 43:04.430]  Like it got started getting more pixelated.
[43:04.590 --> 43:07.250]  I was like, this isn't great, but I can live through it.
[43:07.490 --> 43:11.590]  And I was on TikTok and each TikTok would accumulate further.
[43:11.690 --> 43:15.250]  Like it would stay on the screen to the point where like four TikToks
[43:15.250 --> 43:18.870]  that still seen the outline of what was there before.
[43:18.870 --> 43:23.390]  And then eventually it was like somebody smeared all the pixels.
[43:23.550 --> 43:25.890]  And so it's completely unusable.
[43:25.990 --> 43:32.410]  It's just like streaks of light, essentially, and different shades of my home screen.
[43:32.670 --> 43:36.010]  But I can't turn the phone off.
[43:36.090 --> 43:37.570]  It is stuck in idle.
[43:37.770 --> 43:41.730]  Like if I hold the power button down, it will turn off and then immediately turn back on again.
[43:42.130 --> 43:44.070]  And it's like shorted on.
[43:44.370 --> 43:47.530]  It is shorted on, but that's not the problem.
[43:47.530 --> 43:51.810]  The issue is we were going to do a Sloppy Joe stream recently,
[43:51.810 --> 43:54.230]  and I decided I was going to have a nap.
[43:54.410 --> 43:59.250]  So I set an alarm clock for 7.20 p.m. my time.
[43:59.370 --> 44:02.370]  And now that alarm is still active.
[44:02.470 --> 44:08.970]  So every night at 7.20 p.m., my alarm goes off on that phone.
[44:08.970 --> 44:12.170]  And because of the interface, I can't swipe it.
[44:12.470 --> 44:14.250]  It's completely unusable.
[44:14.990 --> 44:19.330]  And I can't turn the phone off because it just immediately turns back on again.
[44:19.610 --> 44:22.530]  So I have to turn the phone off and then it comes back on.
[44:22.610 --> 44:25.070]  But it clears the alarm in that process.
[44:25.410 --> 44:31.690]  But the battery life on the Umidigi is long, especially when it's not doing any other function.
[44:32.270 --> 44:36.690]  So I have no idea how long I'm going to have to reset this phone.
[44:37.090 --> 44:39.130]  All it has to do is beep once a day.
[44:40.210 --> 44:42.650]  Can you still take photos with it?
[44:42.650 --> 44:47.070]  Is there a hard button on your phone that will take a photo, like click photo?
[44:48.390 --> 44:51.250]  I know. I tried. I did do that.
[44:51.350 --> 44:54.550]  But then I thought, how can I tell if it's capturing it or not?
[44:55.210 --> 44:59.230]  There's no way for you to plug it into a computer and pull files off.
[44:59.310 --> 45:02.090]  Because I would love what you were describing to me.
[45:02.290 --> 45:07.510]  It sounded like when the Beastie Boys recorded their Check Your Head album.
[45:07.690 --> 45:10.590]  They wanted to have a buzzy sound and they didn't know how to achieve it.
[45:10.590 --> 45:14.890]  So they bought a bunch of old microphones from like music stores and pawn shops,
[45:15.030 --> 45:18.830]  and they just started pulling wires out and then singing into them until it sounded cool.
[45:19.530 --> 45:22.730]  And I feel like you've got some sort of a scenario going on there on your phone
[45:22.730 --> 45:25.330]  where who knows what kind of what could be created?
[45:26.390 --> 45:28.990]  Well, unfortunately, it's just the visuals.
[45:29.210 --> 45:30.910]  The audio works great.
[45:31.330 --> 45:34.990]  And even when the phone was working, the camera and flashlight were the only thing.
[45:35.110 --> 45:36.070]  I was like, I can live with that.
[45:36.410 --> 45:38.350]  I don't need those things. The camera sucked anyway.
[45:38.350 --> 45:41.270]  But now it's a problem of every night, 720.
[45:41.390 --> 45:42.370]  50 megapixels though.
[45:44.390 --> 45:46.130]  Yeah, watermarked as well.
[45:46.170 --> 45:47.830]  But I got a new phone coming. I'm excited.
[45:47.970 --> 45:49.270]  I hope it watermarks it as well.
[45:49.790 --> 45:51.590]  What I have what I've headed my way.
[45:51.670 --> 45:53.230]  You guys can see the new future of tech.
[45:53.790 --> 45:56.130]  Is it another Umidigi? Like a waterproof version?
[45:56.610 --> 45:59.750]  I don't want to spoil anything, but we'll see.
[45:59.950 --> 46:01.910]  We'll see what's coming in the future.
[46:02.830 --> 46:03.870]  Another hundred dollar phone.
[46:04.710 --> 46:09.450]  Without this show, I never would have heard of anything called Umidigi in my life.
[46:10.150 --> 46:12.670]  And now it's all I think about with phones.
[46:12.950 --> 46:17.790]  Andrew Slack, the other night, he goes, I just want to let everybody know the Umidigi died.
[46:18.070 --> 46:20.830]  And so if anybody needs me, I might be hard to reach for a while.
[46:20.930 --> 46:22.970]  I thought he was going to a funeral for a pet or something.
[46:23.170 --> 46:24.630]  I was like, fuck, it's Umidigi.
[46:25.410 --> 46:26.890]  And he's like, no, my phone, you idiot.
[46:27.010 --> 46:29.610]  And I was like, I don't know how I was supposed to remember that's what it was called.
[46:29.770 --> 46:32.050]  But I thought I was so concerned for you for a second.
[46:32.470 --> 46:33.730]  Sounded like a dead Tamagotchi.
[46:33.870 --> 46:35.150]  It does.
[46:35.370 --> 46:35.610]  It did.
[46:35.770 --> 46:36.070]  Yeah.
[46:36.630 --> 46:43.470]  Well, listen, the best feature of the Umidigi is they have a burnt-in thing where you think
[46:43.470 --> 46:47.030]  it's your home button, but it's a home button for their store.
[46:47.390 --> 46:49.850]  So you can just buy more Umidigi products.
[46:50.330 --> 46:51.750]  It is a an immediate.
[46:51.950 --> 46:53.650]  It's just built into the phone.
[46:54.190 --> 46:55.210]  So I don't.
[46:56.170 --> 46:57.150]  They're so smart.
[46:58.670 --> 47:00.730]  Oh, I pocket bought another phone.
[47:00.910 --> 47:01.130]  Shit.
[47:01.130 --> 47:04.510]  Well, it's you know, if you want tablets, they got them.
[47:04.670 --> 47:08.870]  It appears as though the occasional time I accidentally hit that button thinking I'm
[47:08.870 --> 47:10.590]  going home and I get to see their product line.
[47:10.770 --> 47:12.010]  They got a lot going on.
[47:12.230 --> 47:14.130]  Umidigi might be a company to invest in.
[47:14.190 --> 47:16.670]  I'm not an expert, but they got tablets.
[47:17.450 --> 47:18.530]  I wonder if they'll sponsor the podcast.
[47:19.890 --> 47:20.350]  I would.
[47:20.590 --> 47:23.850]  My phone collection needs it based off this.
[47:23.910 --> 47:26.930]  But I trust the next phone I'm getting.
[47:27.170 --> 47:28.390]  It sounds real good.
[47:28.670 --> 47:29.730]  It was on sale.
[47:30.530 --> 47:31.810]  I'm I'm I'm a believer.
[47:32.170 --> 47:40.930]  Oh, speaking of believing, I, uh, I, I believe I'm developing some newfound faith in our
[47:40.930 --> 47:41.850]  coworker, Eric.
[47:42.070 --> 47:49.250]  I'm starting to believe I'm starting to believe in him in that he might be a guy who likes
[47:49.250 --> 47:52.130]  to play board games because he came over to my house last night.
[47:52.230 --> 47:54.290]  He came over to my house last night and he joined.
[47:54.410 --> 47:57.570]  He joined in a game of Monopoly and he played for over an hour.
[47:57.570 --> 47:59.090]  I'm sorry, not Monopoly, Uno.
[47:59.290 --> 48:02.530]  He joined in a game of Uno and he played for over an hour.
[48:03.110 --> 48:08.130]  No, I think that fits with him because Eric is a he never wants to, but will if in the
[48:08.130 --> 48:09.290]  scenario I feel has been there.
[48:09.290 --> 48:09.830]  I was tricked.
[48:09.910 --> 48:11.030]  He was instantly having fun.
[48:11.030 --> 48:12.830]  I just want everyone to know that I was tricked.
[48:13.270 --> 48:16.830]  I'd say that's less of a board game, too, because you could easily play that like sat
[48:16.830 --> 48:18.250]  on a wall next to a giant gorilla.
[48:18.630 --> 48:20.490]  I didn't say I'm saying that would be great.
[48:20.710 --> 48:23.610]  I'm saying he's trending in that direction.
[48:24.010 --> 48:25.270]  I'm not, no.
[48:25.270 --> 48:29.490]  I'm telling you, 2024 might be the year we get a we get Eric into board games.
[48:29.690 --> 48:30.290]  It's not.
[48:30.430 --> 48:35.730]  I had I called the full show at AAPW last night and my wife said, hey, we're still over.
[48:36.410 --> 48:38.590]  We're still over here if you want to come over.
[48:38.670 --> 48:39.170]  And I said, yep.
[48:39.310 --> 48:45.790]  And so it was 1030 and I headed over and I was tricked into playing Uno.
[48:45.930 --> 48:49.230]  She said, oh, yeah, they wasn't allowed to tell you that we were playing Uno.
[48:49.430 --> 48:50.490]  So then I got there.
[48:50.590 --> 48:52.790]  I will say no one is good at Uno.
[48:52.790 --> 48:55.670]  Everyone was giggling and falling all over themselves.
[48:55.830 --> 48:58.590]  The only person that I trust to play Uno with is Burndog.
[48:58.770 --> 49:02.750]  Because he is out for no blood and only fun.
[49:03.230 --> 49:07.790]  It is that guy kept fucking shit up left, right and center.
[49:08.090 --> 49:10.770]  It playing Uno with Burndog rocks.
[49:11.130 --> 49:16.830]  Dude, he we're playing this kind of Uno that has these link cards where you can link two
[49:16.830 --> 49:20.230]  people together so that any time one of them draws, the other one has to and vice versa.
[49:20.230 --> 49:23.410]  And Burndog kept linking he and I together.
[49:23.670 --> 49:26.430]  And I'm like, stop linking you at all.
[49:26.550 --> 49:28.590]  First of all, you're just fucking yourself over.
[49:29.350 --> 49:32.750]  And then we made it a rule where you could you could keep adding on to the link.
[49:32.850 --> 49:34.830]  So he would like triple or quadruple link us.
[49:34.950 --> 49:37.590]  So like if I had to draw four, we'd have to draw 16 each.
[49:40.110 --> 49:46.450]  At one point, at one point, somebody put down a blue eight and he just flipped all of his
[49:46.450 --> 49:47.390]  cards upside down.
[49:47.450 --> 49:49.430]  He went, I just want to see if I could do this by feel.
[49:49.430 --> 49:51.170]  And he put down like a red.
[49:51.290 --> 49:57.210]  He put down a red six and he went, nope, and put the card back and then tried again.
[49:59.750 --> 50:01.410]  Anyway, Eric had so much fun.
[50:01.510 --> 50:02.850]  You could tell in his voice how much fun he had.
[50:03.270 --> 50:05.210]  I was so fucking tired.
[50:05.390 --> 50:08.010]  And then we were playing Uno and then nobody wanted to play.
[50:08.250 --> 50:10.370]  And then we got to a point where we let Emily win.
[50:10.630 --> 50:12.190]  It's because you showed up.
[50:12.330 --> 50:15.510]  We had already been playing that hand for over two hours.
[50:15.970 --> 50:20.350]  Like we only played one hand Uno last night and it lasted three and a half hours probably.
[50:20.970 --> 50:23.150]  And then you had like a private Uno the movie happening.
[50:23.390 --> 50:24.410]  Yeah, I didn't even mean to.
[50:24.530 --> 50:25.430]  It just kind of went that way.
[50:25.770 --> 50:29.690]  This version of Uno we were playing with the rules we came up with just made it impossible
[50:29.690 --> 50:30.490]  for anybody to win.
[50:30.810 --> 50:34.370]  There's this point mechanic too, where you put a card down that just has a finger pointing
[50:34.370 --> 50:36.570]  and then everybody points in the direction of somebody.
[50:36.810 --> 50:40.290]  And then you have to pick up as many cards as fingers are pointed at you.
[50:40.390 --> 50:44.870]  So anytime somebody calls Uno, somebody just throws down and then you get five people pointing
[50:44.870 --> 50:45.210]  at you.
[50:45.210 --> 50:46.670]  So it just became impossible.
[50:46.670 --> 50:49.510]  Right, but then also Burn Dog and Geoff were triple linked.
[50:49.630 --> 50:52.670]  So they each ended up picking up like 15 cards.
[50:53.690 --> 50:55.470]  It just kept going.
[50:56.550 --> 51:01.170]  I do love that we once played a game of Uno that started with Barack Obama being president
[51:01.170 --> 51:02.770]  and ended with Trump being president.
[51:03.230 --> 51:04.030]  I did too.
[51:05.410 --> 51:05.950]  That was a lot.
[51:06.070 --> 51:07.130]  That was a great day.
[51:08.030 --> 51:11.690]  Speaking of Burn Dog playing games, Truck Boys put out a Let's Play today.
[51:11.910 --> 51:14.030]  Yeah, the Truck Boys video came out today.
[51:14.030 --> 51:15.470]  I hope everybody enjoyed it.
[51:15.670 --> 51:16.370]  I uh...
[51:16.370 --> 51:16.630]  Ask me why.
[51:17.090 --> 51:20.750]  I was telling Andrew last night, I watched it twice to give notes on it.
[51:21.530 --> 51:24.970]  And I rarely ever watch anything I'm in, you know?
[51:25.470 --> 51:27.830]  God damn, did I hate me in that video.
[51:28.010 --> 51:33.310]  I made... I had so many fucking notes for that video of like, cut out this word, cut out
[51:33.310 --> 51:33.670]  this line.
[51:33.830 --> 51:38.030]  I probably have half the audio in it in release than was in it yesterday.
[51:39.190 --> 51:41.450]  I fucking... I can't ever listen to me.
[51:41.590 --> 51:43.210]  I just grate on me, dude.
[51:43.210 --> 51:45.110]  I fucking can't stand me.
[51:46.290 --> 51:51.390]  That's... it is... as somebody who also struggles with that, I couldn't relate more to Geoff's
[51:51.390 --> 51:56.090]  notes where I would watch the video and it would be something that is literally no other
[51:56.090 --> 51:59.330]  person would think was off or weird or not funny.
[51:59.610 --> 52:03.910]  And Geoff is just self-hating throughout all the notes of that video in a very funny way.
[52:03.910 --> 52:05.710]  Yeah, because when I give notes, I have to tell why.
[52:05.790 --> 52:06.970]  I have to explain why you're cutting.
[52:07.170 --> 52:11.010]  I'm like, you have to cut this moment right now because I sound like a fucking moron.
[52:11.010 --> 52:14.810]  I sound like I... I sound like I just discovered how to drive a car.
[52:15.010 --> 52:16.510]  I'm the dumbest person on Earth.
[52:16.850 --> 52:18.390]  Please don't let this come out.
[52:18.650 --> 52:21.370]  I would be embarrassed for my mother to hear how stupid I am.
[52:21.450 --> 52:25.690]  Like, I have to give like a paragraph of why I'm... why I suck in every note.
[52:26.030 --> 52:26.790]  It's a great video.
[52:27.110 --> 52:27.910]  It's a lot of fun.
[52:28.010 --> 52:28.730]  I enjoyed it.
[52:28.790 --> 52:32.730]  I didn't have any... any notes based off of my experience watching it.
[52:33.430 --> 52:36.070]  I would also just like to take a minute to talk about Expeditions.
[52:36.210 --> 52:37.430]  That game is so fucking fun.
[52:37.830 --> 52:39.770]  I can't wait for them to add co-op to it.
[52:39.770 --> 52:41.210]  So that's new trucks?
[52:41.510 --> 52:42.730]  That's new trucks.
[52:42.950 --> 52:44.230]  Yeah, it should... I think...
[52:44.230 --> 52:44.890]  Does it look better?
[52:45.390 --> 52:46.590]  It looks better.
[52:47.170 --> 52:48.190]  And uh...
[52:48.190 --> 52:49.230]  It looks like Red Dead.
[52:49.550 --> 52:50.530]  It does. Yeah.
[52:50.670 --> 52:52.790]  It takes place in like... in the desert. It looks like Red Dead.
[52:53.270 --> 52:55.790]  I've probably put like 20 hours into it.
[52:55.850 --> 52:58.250]  It's the only game I've been playing for the most part.
[52:59.110 --> 53:00.910]  Uh... I just... I can't get enough.
[53:01.250 --> 53:02.030]  It's so much fun.
[53:02.350 --> 53:03.790]  You can put anchors down, Gavin.
[53:04.170 --> 53:08.250]  And you can winch to... to any of the places that you put down.
[53:08.730 --> 53:10.110]  As long as it's on like dirt.
[53:10.250 --> 53:11.470]  So you can't just do like rock.
[53:11.530 --> 53:12.630]  You can't rock climb with it.
[53:12.930 --> 53:15.710]  But like if you're stuck somewhere instead of just being like,
[53:15.890 --> 53:16.570]  Oh fuck, I'm stuck.
[53:16.890 --> 53:19.730]  You can put a point down and then pull yourself out of it.
[53:19.990 --> 53:20.970]  Yeah. It's fantastic.
[53:21.410 --> 53:22.730]  So you basically... You can go down mountains.
[53:23.570 --> 53:25.630]  Yeah, you basically almost always have a winch point.
[53:25.790 --> 53:29.130]  And then the mountain thing is crazy because you know how like...
[53:29.130 --> 53:31.190]  When you winch to something, you can pull closer to it.
[53:31.250 --> 53:32.430]  But in this game, you have a push.
[53:32.750 --> 53:34.130]  So like Andrew's right.
[53:34.170 --> 53:37.650]  You can put a winch point at the top of a mountain and then connect to it and then push.
[53:37.650 --> 53:39.970]  And then just let yourself go down like Spider-Man.
[53:40.450 --> 53:41.490]  It's so cool.
[53:42.390 --> 53:44.810]  I... A tip for anyone starting that game.
[53:45.390 --> 53:49.790]  There are missions you get where you have to explore a circle they give you on the map.
[53:50.310 --> 53:54.170]  You can do that by whipping out your binoculars and just looking around.
[53:54.550 --> 53:56.910]  Or you have a drone that you can fly around and do it.
[53:57.310 --> 53:59.610]  I took probably like 17 hours.
[53:59.890 --> 54:02.170]  It took me 17 hours into the game to realize this.
[54:02.550 --> 54:06.670]  So to that point, whenever I had a circle, I would drive around every corner of it.
[54:06.670 --> 54:07.830]  And it would take forever.
[54:08.050 --> 54:08.950]  I hated those missions.
[54:09.210 --> 54:11.090]  And then I felt like such a fucking idiot.
[54:11.430 --> 54:13.630]  The first time it was like, you're 60% done.
[54:13.790 --> 54:16.470]  And then I pulled out my binoculars and it was immediately clear.
[54:16.690 --> 54:17.890]  It just gave it to me.
[54:17.950 --> 54:19.430]  We do that in the video.
[54:19.550 --> 54:20.810]  You do it in the video.
[54:20.990 --> 54:22.510]  It was in the first mission.
[54:22.610 --> 54:25.390]  And I was like, oh my God, I don't know why I didn't connect that.
[54:25.530 --> 54:27.190]  That was a thing I could continue to do.
[54:27.270 --> 54:30.250]  Yeah. Does it give you a tip that you could just use a drone or binoculars?
[54:30.310 --> 54:31.070]  It does. Yeah.
[54:31.110 --> 54:33.350]  It's like in the tutorial, essentially.
[54:33.350 --> 54:37.110]  But I don't think I was confused by the drone at that time.
[54:37.270 --> 54:37.790]  It's confusing.
[54:38.050 --> 54:40.750]  They throw a lot at you that's different, but similar, you know.
[54:40.870 --> 54:42.930]  And the whole thing is just it's just a little confusing at first.
[54:43.010 --> 54:46.750]  I still don't understand exactly how garages do or don't work.
[54:46.950 --> 54:51.570]  I will say playing a game for the first time on camera is one of the worst ways to play.
[54:52.570 --> 54:56.510]  It's the best way to miss all the tips and tutorial information.
[54:57.510 --> 54:59.910]  That game, especially we were kind enough.
[55:00.010 --> 55:01.870]  They gave us early access to it to like make that.
[55:01.870 --> 55:04.970]  We got codes for we'll eventually do co-op stuff in it.
[55:05.210 --> 55:09.750]  It is the coolest game to get the player early because there were times where instinctually
[55:09.750 --> 55:11.510]  I'd be like, where the fuck do I find this?
[55:11.650 --> 55:14.650]  I'll look up a guide and then realizing, oh, there's none.
[55:14.930 --> 55:17.910]  There's I have to find it like I'm truly on this expedition.
[55:18.250 --> 55:20.230]  I need to try to track this thing down.
[55:20.770 --> 55:24.470]  For me, what I realized last night when playing it is that
[55:24.470 --> 55:27.950]  and I think it's the reason why I actually prefer expeditions.
[55:27.950 --> 55:34.430]  I think overall to SnowRunner is the puzzle of SnowRunner and the hurdle is you're stuck.
[55:34.470 --> 55:35.150]  It's movement.
[55:35.530 --> 55:40.190]  It's trying to figure out how to get through this terrain that is really difficult,
[55:40.190 --> 55:44.930]  where expedition is more about resource management and the movement itself
[55:44.930 --> 55:48.570]  is not nearly as complicated to get to like point A to point B.
[55:48.910 --> 55:51.630]  I'm very rarely completely stuck and don't know what to do.
[55:51.790 --> 55:54.990]  It's more like, oh, fuck, I only have this much gas
[55:54.990 --> 55:57.550]  because when you recover now, you don't get gas back for it.
[55:57.550 --> 56:03.070]  You do have some in your home station, but that that depletes like it doesn't constantly redeem.
[56:03.530 --> 56:06.370]  So this yeah, this is this is where it's a little confusing to me.
[56:06.470 --> 56:09.230]  So you you basically have to plan for success,
[56:09.230 --> 56:13.370]  bring everything you think you could possibly need out onto the expedition with you.
[56:13.430 --> 56:16.310]  And then if you get if you run out of gas out there,
[56:16.390 --> 56:21.150]  are you able to drive another vehicle out to refuel you or are you just fucked?
[56:21.510 --> 56:22.410]  So here's the thing.
[56:22.410 --> 56:27.770]  If you if you have a base in that region, you could put a car there,
[56:27.770 --> 56:30.950]  but you can't drive multiple cars on a multiple areas.
[56:31.450 --> 56:34.130]  So I did a thing where I brought two trucks with me,
[56:34.170 --> 56:36.770]  one with the intent of it just being a fuel truck,
[56:36.850 --> 56:40.290]  and I couldn't travel to a new zone with both of them.
[56:40.490 --> 56:41.450]  I could only do one.
[56:42.330 --> 56:48.430]  So essentially, whatever you bring into that zone lives in that zone in terms of multiple trucks.
[56:48.530 --> 56:50.530]  Like when co-op is added, this won't be a problem.
[56:50.590 --> 56:51.670]  It'll be a pretty easy solution.
[56:51.670 --> 56:53.990]  One person is fuel, the other person drives.
[56:54.630 --> 56:57.330]  But it is region locked in a way that SnowRunners isn't.
[56:57.450 --> 56:59.370]  So if you're in a zone that doesn't...
[56:59.370 --> 57:01.970]  Instead of garages, it's like bases that you have.
[57:02.270 --> 57:05.230]  If you're in a region that doesn't have a base, you just can't recover.
[57:05.550 --> 57:06.330]  You're just stuck.
[57:06.610 --> 57:10.030]  You have to end the run essentially and start over from the beginning.
[57:10.130 --> 57:13.030]  Also, from what I can tell in that game,
[57:13.190 --> 57:16.350]  everything that's being done is in the service of selling meth.
[57:16.350 --> 57:22.530]  You're out in the desert and there's just all these huts and tents and random equipment
[57:22.530 --> 57:24.970]  hidden in the back of a pickup truck covered by a tarp.
[57:25.310 --> 57:26.030]  And you're just going.
[57:26.530 --> 57:28.070]  There's no fucking roads around.
[57:28.170 --> 57:29.110]  It's real sketchy.
[57:29.550 --> 57:31.010]  It definitely looks like...
[57:31.010 --> 57:32.530]  It's definitely some Breaking Bad shit.
[57:33.490 --> 57:36.350]  Yeah, they're aware of that in the sense of I feel like
[57:36.350 --> 57:40.310]  maybe the fourth expedition you do is a straight up Breaking Bad reference.
[57:40.690 --> 57:41.230]  Oh, is it really?
[57:41.730 --> 57:44.310]  Yeah, I think there's a mission called Breaking Brad
[57:44.310 --> 57:50.430]  and you have to go to what is the equivalent of like the RV from the show or the meth lab is.
[57:50.570 --> 57:51.930]  It's great. Such a fun game.
[57:52.490 --> 57:54.130]  I can't wait for you guys to play more of it.
[57:54.230 --> 57:55.970]  And I absolutely can't wait for co-op.
[57:56.070 --> 57:57.170]  We're going to have so much fun in that thing.
[57:57.570 --> 57:58.990]  Yeah, we're going to make a billion videos in it.
[57:59.050 --> 57:59.530]  And who knows?
[57:59.570 --> 58:01.570]  Maybe I'll even have the truck boys back again for another video.
[58:01.690 --> 58:02.470]  If people like that.
[58:02.730 --> 58:04.050]  Yeah, I had so much fun playing with them.
[58:04.550 --> 58:05.030]  It was great.
[58:05.310 --> 58:05.910]  It was very funny.
[58:05.990 --> 58:06.950]  We're in the beginning of the video.
[58:07.030 --> 58:09.570]  It's established that like, OK, well, who's going to start?
[58:09.670 --> 58:13.170]  And then the person playing Willie Nelson does not give up that control.
[58:13.170 --> 58:17.050]  We talked about it after we didn't even realize that I was in the I recorded.
[58:17.270 --> 58:18.030]  So that video comes out.
[58:18.110 --> 58:18.910]  It's about an hour and a half.
[58:19.010 --> 58:20.510]  It was almost three hours of recording.
[58:21.210 --> 58:23.630]  And after we sat down, like 10 minutes later, we're in the kitchen.
[58:23.970 --> 58:27.070]  And Bernie's like, wait a minute, we didn't let nobody else play.
[58:27.810 --> 58:30.550]  Oh, yeah, it's great.
[58:31.770 --> 58:33.310]  It was fucking it was so much fun.
[58:33.410 --> 58:34.910]  You guys, did you guys play?
[58:35.150 --> 58:36.230]  You guys play trucks last night?
[58:36.810 --> 58:38.390]  No, no, I went to bed.
[58:38.510 --> 58:39.210]  I was tired.
[58:39.290 --> 58:39.750]  No way.
[58:40.170 --> 58:41.690]  We only left at like midnight.
[58:41.690 --> 58:43.150]  Yeah, Bernie might have.
[58:43.270 --> 58:45.530]  But I watched The Traders and fell asleep.
[58:46.030 --> 58:46.710]  Traders is good.
[58:47.170 --> 58:48.150]  It is good, dude.
[58:48.270 --> 58:52.450]  I mean, there's a if you're in America, there's three new seasons.
[58:53.130 --> 58:58.890]  UK season two, Australia season two and New Zealand season one are all hitting this month
[58:58.890 --> 58:59.470]  on Peacock.
[58:59.990 --> 59:02.310]  So I have a question about season two of the American one.
[59:02.550 --> 59:07.230]  OK, what in the goddamn is John Bercow doing on that?
[59:08.470 --> 59:09.630]  I'll tell you what he's doing.
[59:09.790 --> 59:10.890]  He's sussing out traders.
[59:11.690 --> 59:20.830]  It's like it's like 18 U.S. reality stars and the former speaker of the House of Commons.
[59:22.310 --> 59:23.390]  It's the weirdest.
[59:24.090 --> 59:26.270]  I don't understand how he got to that position.
[59:26.650 --> 59:26.810]  Did he?
[59:26.890 --> 59:28.090]  Does he want to be a reality star?
[59:28.430 --> 59:29.250]  How do you get on that?
[59:29.530 --> 59:31.870]  They're just trying to make it make for an interesting show.
[59:32.350 --> 59:34.410]  It makes it it's very interesting, too.
[59:34.630 --> 59:36.610]  And he's a he's a beloved guy on the show.
[59:36.710 --> 59:37.290]  Everybody loves him.
[59:38.150 --> 59:38.770]  Yeah, he's great.
[59:41.810 --> 59:42.950]  How far into it are you?
[59:43.030 --> 59:43.550]  Have you caught up?
[59:44.410 --> 59:46.030]  No, I've just I'm like two episodes in.
[59:46.170 --> 59:48.370]  I watched I watched him fall in mud.
[59:50.290 --> 59:54.490]  Speaking of mud and trucks, I've had a recent development.
[59:55.090 --> 59:59.450]  There's this, you know, when I go for a walk in my neighborhood lately or go for a bike ride,
[59:59.610 --> 01:00:01.210]  there's this kid down the street.
[01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:08.530]  So fucking kid down the street who is always playing with this monster truck that's like a shark.
[01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:12.230]  And I get so fucking jealous of this little fucker and his truck.
[01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:13.550]  It looks like he's having so much fun.
[01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:13.970]  Right.
[01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:17.190]  And so I went to Target.
[01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:17.790]  I was like, fuck it.
[01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:18.650]  I can have one, too.
[01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:20.870]  So I went to Target and I bought one.
[01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:26.730]  And so now this three year old on my street isn't the only one with a cool monster truck.
[01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:29.250]  There's a 48 year old competing with him.
[01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:32.810]  But I took it to the park and I started playing with it.
[01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:34.990]  And I took a bunch of videos because it was so much fun.
[01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:36.510]  And I sent them to Burndog and Antonio.
[01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:43.270]  And now they want to build it like a monster truck track in Burndog's backyard that we can do real trucks in.
[01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:45.510]  That's great.
[01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:46.150]  Yeah.
[01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:48.510]  So you've just been in the park playing with your toy?
[01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:49.910]  Yeah, I've been in the park playing with this.
[01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:50.430]  See, I said it.
[01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:51.290]  The little monster truck.
[01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:52.150]  He's the shark.
[01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.370]  Oh, he's fucking wild, dude.
[01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:58.010]  He can do so much fun stuff and he can climb.
[01:00:58.210 --> 01:00:59.890]  And there's like, it's so cool.
[01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:01.250]  It's so cool.
[01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:02.830]  So we're just going to build like the coolest.
[01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:03.910]  We're going to do.
[01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.770]  It's just going to be amazing.
[01:01:04.770 --> 01:01:07.730]  We're going to build trucks in Burndog's backyard.
[01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.690]  And then we can play trucks all day long.
[01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:10.570]  People can come over.
[01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:11.770]  We'll put up some speakers.
[01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:13.490]  Have some fucking music blasting.
[01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:14.830]  It's going to be, you guys are all invited.
[01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:15.770]  We're going to, it's going to be amazing.
[01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:17.990]  Did you have a go-to RC car when you were younger?
[01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:18.690]  No.
[01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:19.310]  No.
[01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:20.030]  I had this bad boy.
[01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:23.750]  That's the one that goes both ways, right?
[01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:26.870]  It flips over and you can drive it.
[01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:27.690]  Yeah, I had that.
[01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:28.930]  That was fucking awesome.
[01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:30.710]  That'd be a great addition to trucks.
[01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:31.650]  Absolutely.
[01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:33.730]  Well, I think everybody should get a truck.
[01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:35.450]  And we should all get involved.
[01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:37.190]  Maybe make some real life truck videos.
[01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:38.950]  We weren't even thinking about like,
[01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:40.490]  we weren't even thinking about getting into it.
[01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:42.430]  Like if we're trucking and somebody flips over,
[01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:44.390]  you got to rescue them with the other trucks.
[01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:46.470]  I've got to say, I can,
[01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:50.130]  this is heading straight for like robot wars.
[01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:51.170]  What's that, what's that coming here?
[01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:53.170]  We're going to start as trucks.
[01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:56.150]  And it's going to be a battle bots or whatever by the end of it.
[01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.490]  Yeah.
[01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:57.350]  That's awesome.
[01:01:57.830 --> 01:01:58.510]  That's awesome.
[01:01:58.610 --> 01:01:59.190]  I can't wait.
[01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:02.150]  I'm going to get a little one that has like a little scooper.
[01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:04.290]  At first, it's just going to raise the other trucks.
[01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:07.030]  And by the end of it, it's going to be sending them like 16 feet.
[01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:10.610]  Start thinking about trucks.
[01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:12.590]  Start looking for trucks now, because I'm telling you,
[01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:13.570]  this is going to be happening.
[01:02:13.810 --> 01:02:14.350]  This is our future.
[01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:16.810]  Your original RC car, Gavin,
[01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:19.630]  looks like when you leveled up a car in Crackdown.
[01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:21.590]  It looks like a prototype of that.
[01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:25.990]  It looks like your RC car is like the level four vehicle of that RC car.
[01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:29.010]  I can click on the thumbstick and just drive straight up a wall.
[01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:31.750]  Oh, man.
[01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:33.490]  Crackdown was so fun.
[01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:35.170]  And for some reason, the other ones weren't.
[01:02:35.290 --> 01:02:36.750]  I could never figure that out.
[01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:42.170]  It's it is weird that they took the they took the magic of Crackdown one
[01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:47.010]  and and then made two video, two, two new games that had none of it.
[01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:52.490]  There. Yeah, it scratches the niche, the other games.
[01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:54.550]  But no, it's they're definitely not improvements.
[01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:56.350]  This is fun.
[01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:58.830]  This is a good episode.
[01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:00.010]  One ninety seven.
[01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:02.930]  Yeah, this was a good episode.
[01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:03.890]  One ninety seven.
[01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:05.650]  That's an excellent point, Andrew.
[01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:07.530]  I agree.
[01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:10.250]  Yeah, I guess it's probably time to wrap it up.
[01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:11.330]  Eric didn't tell us to wrap it up yet.
[01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:12.770]  We're not wrapping it up early, are we?
[01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:13.790]  I don't I don't know.
[01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:15.010]  I mean, we've been at an hour.
[01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:15.610]  Yeah.
[01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:19.630]  Do we want to get into the fact that this is one ninety seven and not one?
[01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:23.230]  Yeah, well, I think I mean, I think after you, you audience,
[01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:24.690]  you just listen to the whole episode.
[01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:26.170]  It should be pretty clear to you.
[01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:28.090]  This was episode one hundred and ninety seven.
[01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:30.030]  It was a hell of an episode.
[01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:30.870]  It was a great episode.
[01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:32.230]  It felt like a banger.
[01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:35.210]  But it didn't feel like it didn't feel like a one ninety six.
[01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:38.530]  We were talking about it the other day and we just thought the lamest,
[01:03:38.650 --> 01:03:42.530]  most expected thing in the world is to go in order.
[01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:43.910]  One ninety two.
[01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:45.270]  One ninety three.
[01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.390]  Yawn.
[01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:47.470]  One ninety four.
[01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:48.390]  One ninety five.
[01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:50.290]  Oh my God, I'm going to fucking fall asleep right now.
[01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:51.110]  One ninety six.
[01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:55.590]  What if we skip one ninety six, go right to one ninety seven
[01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:59.650]  and then you don't know when one ninety six is coming out?
[01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:00.770]  Maybe it's next week.
[01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:02.550]  Maybe it comes out after two or four.
[01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:04.230]  Maybe it doesn't come out for a year.
[01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:05.950]  We don't want you to see it coming.
[01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:07.830]  We want you to be surprised by it.
[01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.630]  One ninety six is too special.
[01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:14.370]  It's too good to just throw it out because a six comes after a five.
[01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:15.210]  That's stupid.
[01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:20.390]  The only thing you know about one ninety six is that it is an absolute banger.
[01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:21.990]  And it's not this one.
[01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.990]  No.
[01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:27.710]  All right, well, thanks for listening.
[01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:29.010]  Thanks for hanging out with me, guys.
[01:04:29.590 --> 01:04:32.550]  But we never mentioned it at the beginning, which means a lot of people are going to...
[01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:34.790]  Actually, did you even intro one ninety seven?
[01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:36.830]  No, I didn't intro one ninety seven.
[01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:38.570]  Yeah, I never introed it.
[01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:40.570]  So I figured they'd have to listen to the end to find out.
[01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:41.530]  And then they find out at the end.
[01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:42.250]  And now they understand.
[01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:45.850]  And they're fucking super excited because they know they're getting to one ninety six someday.
[01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:47.030]  But they don't know when it is.
[01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:48.850]  Is next week going to be one ninety eight?
[01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:50.570]  Or is it going to be one ninety six?
[01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:53.710]  Nobody on earth knows, including us.
[01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:01.510]  Oh, it's going to be a fun year.
[01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:02.670]  I'm really excited.
[01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:04.470]  I'm very excited.
[01:05:04.810 --> 01:05:06.810]  We've got so many video games to play.
[01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:08.290]  We've got real life trucks.
[01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:11.370]  We've got all kinds of shenanigans planned.
[01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:14.030]  Before we wrap this, can I mention one thing about expeditions?
[01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:14.710]  I forgot to mention.
[01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:17.410]  Yeah, I want to try to get some cred with the truck boys.
[01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:18.890]  I've been playing it a lot.
[01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:21.870]  The achievements haven't been enabled in early access.
[01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:22.350]  I saw that.
[01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:24.390]  They turned them on this morning.
[01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:25.610]  So it was a great.
[01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:27.870]  It was one of the best gaming feelings I've had of.
[01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:29.130]  Oh, another pop.
[01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.950]  Another pop.
[01:05:30.110 --> 01:05:30.550]  Another pop.
[01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:37.570]  I'm the first person on Xbox to get the I believe it's the expedition achievement,
[01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:40.250]  which is to travel a hundred kilometers in the game.
[01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:45.470]  It's only the second time I've ever gotten achievement pop to say zero point zero.
[01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:46.210]  Congratulations.
[01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:47.170]  What was the other?
[01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:52.790]  Yeah, there were like probably five or six and all the other ones had some amount.
[01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:53.350]  It was like.
[01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:54.110]  No, no.
[01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:55.770]  I mean, what was the other zero point zero you got?
[01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:57.950]  Oh, it was in Prey.
[01:05:58.430 --> 01:06:02.530]  I we got early access to the Prey game and it was I was the first person to discover
[01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:04.870]  all of the audio logs for a character in that.
[01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:07.110]  I don't remember what the achievement was called, but.
[01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:10.090]  Hey, this is a a trucks thing that I'm excited.
[01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:13.150]  That's I'm I'm so fucking excited.
[01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:16.830]  I'm so I'm just excited about all form of trucks in the future.
[01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:20.670]  Speaking of trucks, before we before we wrap up, I feel like we should mention
[01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:23.650]  we recorded a series of videos yesterday.
[01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:24.590]  Gavin, you missed this.
[01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:29.770]  I'm sorry you missed it in a game called Turbo Golf Racing.
[01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:31.430]  I think so.
[01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:35.190]  Yeah, I am so fucking excited for those videos to come out.
[01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:38.670]  Gavin, it was Rocket League and golf together.
[01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:42.810]  It was insane.
[01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:48.630]  And Eric, I've never seen once again, Eric, big board game guy, big game guy
[01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:51.870]  instantly was like, I don't want to do anything other than play this game
[01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:52.610]  for the rest of my life.
[01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:55.470]  I think this podcast is changing, Eric.
[01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:56.170]  It is.
[01:06:56.170 --> 01:06:59.030]  No, I nothing about what are you talking about?
[01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:05.230]  There's no nothing we did yesterday in the golf trucks game was anything other than golf.
[01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:05.930]  It was just golf.
[01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:07.250]  We just went fast and hit the ball.
[01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:07.810]  It was great.
[01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:10.010]  There's I think you're enjoying things more.
[01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:10.350]  He is.
[01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:10.930]  He is.
[01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:12.750]  He's trying to hide the fact that he's having fun.
[01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:16.830]  I I will say I enjoy multiplayer gaming more since we started.
[01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:18.230]  Let's play 100 percent.
[01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:22.070]  I don't play games with other people or online or anything.
[01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.610]  And I started to do that now since we started.
[01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:26.110]  Let's play 100 percent.
[01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.590]  Absolutely.
[01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:27.070]  That's great.
[01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:29.010]  Yeah, everything else I still hate.
[01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:31.190]  So it's the worms video.
[01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:35.710]  The worms video we were talking about a few episodes ago where we were talking about what
[01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:38.390]  I was talking about quitting worms forever is now out.
[01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:43.930]  It was it's a good one.
[01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:46.290]  You go to facepod.com slash first.

[01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:55.730]  And boy, is it a good game of worms?
[01:07:56.070 --> 01:07:57.690]  It is a great one.
[01:07:57.830 --> 01:07:58.270]  It is.
[01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:00.450]  Oh, it's a good one.
[01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:01.270]  You should go check it out.
[01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:03.810]  I thought it was insane to put that one behind the paywall.
[01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:05.610]  And then after watching it, I'm kind of glad.
[01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:08.470]  I'm trying to do you a favor, buddy.
[01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.510]  Yeah.
[01:08:11.330 --> 01:08:12.910]  Oh, we need to wrap up 197.
[01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:13.350]  Yeah.
[01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:16.510]  Thanks for listening to another episode of the Face podcast.
[01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:17.830]  Please listen.
[01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:21.170]  Keep an eye out for some of these videos and things we've been talking about.
[01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:21.950]  They'll be out soon.
[01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:23.490]  A lot of fun stuff in the future.
[01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:27.910]  We're going to have some fuzzy peach baseballs at some point for you to buy.
[01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:31.390]  And we'll see you in the mud.
[01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:33.350]  It's like a truck's thing.
[01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:37.490]  Hey, guys, Major League fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of Face.
[01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:38.610]  You guessed it.
[01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:40.410]  The gang is still behind on recording.
[01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:44.110]  So here's some more assumptions about what's going to happen in the next episode.
[01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:46.690]  Hey, did you know Geoff has a dog named Albert?
[01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:48.350]  Gracie has had enough.
[01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:52.130]  Andrew is being traded for a third round pick and a new hot dog machine.
[01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:54.750]  It turns out Eric doesn't actually like wrestling.
[01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:56.590]  The gang moves to Key West.
[01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.470]  Gavin reveals a massive secret.
[01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:00.990]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:03.710]  All that and more on next week's episode of Face.
[01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:04.490]  Maybe.
