[00:02.530 --> 00:04.510]  Oh, it's me. It's Eric from the future.
[00:04.670 --> 00:06.370]  I should have been prescient about more things,
[00:06.570 --> 00:08.350]  but I'm here and I'm here with Nick.
[00:08.430 --> 00:09.770]  Oh, there's not enough time, Eric.
[00:09.990 --> 00:11.630]  I can't hold it for long. I can't hold it for long.
[00:11.630 --> 00:14.070]  We don't have a lot of time, but we have to tell you
[00:14.070 --> 00:16.470]  about some merch drops. Our last merch drops.
[00:16.870 --> 00:18.990]  The last f***ing face merch drops ever.
[00:19.410 --> 00:22.330]  On Friday, the 15th at 10 a.m.,
[00:22.330 --> 00:24.530]  we have the exclusive Gerplers.
[00:24.730 --> 00:27.610]  For first members, we have multicolor Gerplers.
[00:27.710 --> 00:28.990]  The purple that goes to green.
[00:28.990 --> 00:32.570]  And for everyone else, the f***ing face Gerple-Gerplers.
[00:32.710 --> 00:34.970]  Nick, hang on. Hold on, there's a little more.
[00:35.170 --> 00:36.070]  Hurry, hurry.
[00:36.390 --> 00:40.250]  On 3-29, the 29th of March,
[00:40.370 --> 00:42.350]  we have the Sloppy Joe's jersey.
[00:42.630 --> 00:44.450]  We also have the f***ing face hat.
[00:44.730 --> 00:46.490]  We also have the foam hands
[00:46.490 --> 00:49.430]  and the release of the f***ing face cookbook.
[00:49.670 --> 00:50.910]  We're running out of time, Nick.
[00:50.970 --> 00:52.930]  These people have to go. We have to go.
[00:53.010 --> 00:54.570]  Keep listening. We'll see you later. Bye!
[01:12.190 --> 01:13.790]  Am I recording?
[01:14.430 --> 01:15.830]  I am recording, okay.
[01:16.530 --> 01:17.010]  Yeah, I'm good.
[01:17.630 --> 01:20.190]  Mike Tyson's fighting Jake Paul, 198. Take it away.
[01:20.990 --> 01:25.650]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the f***ing face podcast.
[01:26.010 --> 01:27.330]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:27.830 --> 01:29.390]  And with me, as always,
[01:29.870 --> 01:31.790]  a very unemployed Andrew Panton,
[01:31.910 --> 01:33.730]  a very unemployed Gavin Free,
[01:33.930 --> 01:36.770]  a very unemployed Eric Baudour,
[01:36.970 --> 01:38.890]  a very unemployed Gracie Flynn,
[01:38.890 --> 01:41.330]  and a very unemployed Nick Schwartz,
[01:41.410 --> 01:43.010]  and a very unemployed Geoff Ramsey.
[01:43.230 --> 01:45.250]  How's everybody doing? This is 198.
[01:45.870 --> 01:48.650]  Reason for termination, job elimination.
[01:49.090 --> 01:51.830]  I always thought it would be much cooler than that.
[01:52.050 --> 01:52.330]  Yeah.
[01:52.890 --> 01:53.850]  I thought it'd be funnier.
[01:54.350 --> 01:58.030]  I have unlocked an ick that I didn't know existed.
[01:58.470 --> 02:00.570]  And this isn't directed at anybody in particular,
[02:01.050 --> 02:04.310]  but I have learned there is nothing lamer
[02:04.650 --> 02:07.850]  than being laid off from the company you founded.
[02:09.790 --> 02:13.850]  I gotta say, I think that's a distinction
[02:13.850 --> 02:17.350]  that not many people get to claim.
[02:17.910 --> 02:18.830]  I'm gonna wear it.
[02:18.990 --> 02:19.290]  Is it?
[02:19.550 --> 02:22.490]  I don't know if I'm gonna wear it as a badge of honor or failure,
[02:22.810 --> 02:24.930]  but it's a badge I gotta wear, I guess.
[02:25.370 --> 02:26.870]  Is it a layoff?
[02:27.070 --> 02:28.770]  Because I wasn't sure about that.
[02:28.930 --> 02:31.490]  Because when I think layoff, I typically think percentage of company.
[02:31.950 --> 02:33.970]  When the company says it exists,
[02:33.970 --> 02:36.470]  I don't know if that is a layoff.
[02:36.470 --> 02:39.030]  Do you remember when they shut down the Halo 2 servers,
[02:39.210 --> 02:41.770]  but anyone still in a game could just sit in the game?
[02:41.950 --> 02:43.470]  Yes, we thought about that.
[02:43.510 --> 02:44.990]  I thought about that yesterday a little bit.
[02:45.090 --> 02:48.370]  What if we just start an episode of F*** Face
[02:48.370 --> 02:51.510]  at like 4.59pm on the final day,
[02:52.010 --> 02:54.090]  and we'll be the last people out?
[02:54.690 --> 02:59.250]  Hey, can I break character for one second in this moment?
[02:59.370 --> 03:01.010]  I wanna say something with sincerity,
[03:01.190 --> 03:04.190]  because we're now laughing, and we're making jokes.
[03:04.190 --> 03:07.850]  We are making the most of maybe the most painful thing
[03:07.850 --> 03:11.390]  that's happened in some of our lives,
[03:11.410 --> 03:12.950]  and certainly it's up there for me.
[03:13.090 --> 03:17.410]  This is devastating, and this is not a laughing matter.
[03:18.090 --> 03:19.750]  A lot of lives have been affected,
[03:20.030 --> 03:21.990]  and we are heartbroken for them,
[03:22.190 --> 03:24.210]  and for ourselves, honestly.
[03:24.830 --> 03:27.230]  And everybody has to figure out what to do,
[03:27.250 --> 03:29.330]  and how to pick up the pieces and move on with their lives.
[03:29.430 --> 03:32.690]  But this podcast is a place for fun,
[03:32.690 --> 03:34.230]  and a reverence, and friendship.
[03:34.890 --> 03:37.130]  And it's my therapy, and it's Gavin's therapy,
[03:37.330 --> 03:38.310]  and it's Andrew's therapy,
[03:38.310 --> 03:40.930]  and the only way I know how to be with you guys
[03:40.930 --> 03:42.370]  is the way we are.
[03:42.530 --> 03:45.870]  And so we're gonna do this podcast the way we do this podcast,
[03:46.170 --> 03:48.330]  which is to make fun of our lives,
[03:48.770 --> 03:51.310]  and be self-effacing, because that's all we got.
[03:51.790 --> 03:54.210]  So, out of character now.
[03:54.870 --> 03:56.410]  Yeah, I'm dead inside.
[03:56.730 --> 04:00.630]  I think I was worried that it would just be another round of laughs.
[04:00.630 --> 04:04.130]  And we would somehow survive and still be doing it.
[04:04.450 --> 04:06.670]  I think, I mean, as sad as it is,
[04:06.770 --> 04:09.530]  I am kind of glad that we're all just going out together.
[04:10.090 --> 04:11.110]  At the same time.
[04:11.750 --> 04:14.990]  I can't agree with you more on that.
[04:15.250 --> 04:18.470]  The idea that we are together and in the same boat,
[04:18.610 --> 04:20.370]  and just so the world knows,
[04:20.970 --> 04:22.690]  and anybody who's listening to this podcast together,
[04:22.850 --> 04:25.590]  the six people on this podcast right now are in it together.
[04:26.270 --> 04:26.590]  Hell yeah.
[04:27.910 --> 04:29.410]  Fucking Dragon Years.
[04:29.670 --> 04:31.810]  Man, I tried to warn everybody.
[04:32.490 --> 04:33.490]  This is my fault.
[04:33.790 --> 04:34.890]  This is Dragon Year.
[04:35.570 --> 04:39.810]  I extended a little beyond my means a little bit.
[04:40.030 --> 04:41.610]  We got a little rat man involved.
[04:42.190 --> 04:42.450]  Boo!
[04:44.430 --> 04:45.990]  We need to...
[04:46.530 --> 04:47.770]  Let's talk about the things.
[04:48.090 --> 04:53.390]  So, I don't even know where to begin with the mishaps that I have encountered,
[04:53.390 --> 04:58.230]  and just the rakes that I've put down to step on at this time.
[04:58.390 --> 05:00.590]  I guess I'll start with the things that you guys know.
[05:01.670 --> 05:02.670]  Ratty boy.
[05:03.310 --> 05:04.790]  In the works for a long time.
[05:05.250 --> 05:09.250]  Nick just sent the thumbnail we posted on YouTube.
[05:09.710 --> 05:10.790]  So, for context,
[05:11.870 --> 05:16.510]  the episode's release on YouTube at 8am Pacific,
[05:17.910 --> 05:18.970]  10pm Central,
[05:19.710 --> 05:21.110]  and because of that...
[05:21.110 --> 05:21.610]  10am Central.
[05:22.430 --> 05:23.550]  10am Central, yeah.
[05:24.290 --> 05:26.350]  But because the episode comes out at that time,
[05:26.650 --> 05:30.990]  and this supplemental piece announcing Ratty Boy came out on the same day,
[05:31.290 --> 05:32.290]  Nick and I had a talk of like,
[05:32.350 --> 05:36.530]  oh, we'll push it 30 minutes after the episode launches
[05:36.530 --> 05:37.570]  so it's not the same release.
[05:37.670 --> 05:40.530]  A little bit of breathing time, but still around for the YouTube audience.
[05:41.430 --> 05:44.490]  And that is when the all-hands meeting was that we learned.
[05:44.490 --> 05:50.790]  So, like, simultaneously with the announcement of the company closing,
[05:51.370 --> 05:54.950]  we posted a YouTube video called An Announcement,
[05:55.290 --> 05:58.670]  and it's just the face logo with like six different questions.
[05:58.910 --> 06:01.350]  As the information was sweeping across the company,
[06:01.470 --> 06:06.870]  I got like Spotify and Apple Podcast notifications ping in that just said An Announcement.
[06:06.990 --> 06:12.770]  Dude, I was only tangentially aware that this was all going on.
[06:12.770 --> 06:15.770]  Andrew, you were kind of working on this, and I don't want to say secrecy,
[06:15.970 --> 06:19.770]  but you were kind of handling it off to the side,
[06:19.890 --> 06:21.750]  and we were all distracted with other things.
[06:22.890 --> 06:24.610]  And so this is all happening.
[06:24.930 --> 06:27.810]  I was just like, what the fuck are we doing?
[06:28.170 --> 06:29.810]  What is... I can't look at it.
[06:29.850 --> 06:31.290]  I can't look at it right now. I got to focus on this.
[06:31.570 --> 06:33.930]  But I was so... I still haven't watched that 13-minute video.
[06:34.070 --> 06:34.970]  I don't know what's in it.
[06:35.090 --> 06:37.990]  Oh, you haven't seen... you haven't seen any of it?
[06:38.110 --> 06:39.670]  No, I've seen nothing of it.
[06:39.670 --> 06:42.070]  It's not so good. Don't worry. It's nothing bad.
[06:44.350 --> 06:45.750]  What happened was...
[06:46.550 --> 06:47.230]  Holy shit!
[06:47.630 --> 06:54.110]  No, when you see an announcement video, your mind always goes to the worst place.
[06:54.510 --> 06:57.550]  And so I thought, I need to try to mitigate this.
[06:57.950 --> 07:01.610]  So days prior, I had recorded a little intro,
[07:01.990 --> 07:04.550]  because we recorded the bulk of that segment in December.
[07:04.910 --> 07:08.390]  And we've been waiting to announce this for quite a while.
[07:08.390 --> 07:09.290]  And just figuring it out.
[07:09.410 --> 07:10.970]  And it's been in the works for months.
[07:11.650 --> 07:13.710]  So I wanted to record a little piece at the beginning.
[07:13.890 --> 07:17.290]  That was like, hey, calm down. Everything is all good.
[07:17.350 --> 07:20.050]  So literally, the beginning of that video is me being like,
[07:20.310 --> 07:23.070]  hey, it's an announcement. And actually, the announcement is great.
[07:23.230 --> 07:25.610]  Don't worry about it. It's fantastic news.
[07:26.010 --> 07:27.570]  We'll get more into it.
[07:28.290 --> 07:29.370]  What are the chances?
[07:29.950 --> 07:30.730]  What are the timing?
[07:30.970 --> 07:33.750]  We never have put out just a blank announcement, surely.
[07:33.750 --> 07:40.010]  F*** Face is the most F*** Face thing in the history of F*** Faces.
[07:40.170 --> 07:44.210]  It's going to be people making their way through each department's announcements,
[07:44.990 --> 07:47.670]  finding our one, and being like, what?
[07:49.350 --> 07:50.950]  I guess they don't mind?
[07:54.310 --> 08:00.450]  Every step of the way of this Ratty Boy reveal was just, like, the worst timing.
[08:00.450 --> 08:04.770]  It was a complete, a genuine blindside.
[08:05.210 --> 08:09.070]  And in the grand scheme of the company, what a nothing announcement as well.
[08:11.210 --> 08:14.770]  You take that Ratty Boy legend.
[08:15.390 --> 08:18.190]  That's a big deal, regardless of the context.
[08:21.510 --> 08:23.850]  So that's one layer of this.
[08:24.230 --> 08:26.610]  I'm going to pull up a tweet that I made.
[08:28.930 --> 08:33.850]  I quote tweeted the announcement before, saying the biggest deal in entertainment.
[08:34.110 --> 08:35.450]  That also wasn't ideal.
[08:36.030 --> 08:41.610]  We did a tease that the Ratty Boy, I'm just screenshotting it right now.
[08:42.310 --> 08:46.290]  We did a tease on social media that Ratty Boy was coming.
[08:47.470 --> 08:50.090]  And people were like, oh, another Let's Play type thing.
[08:50.470 --> 08:51.990]  So then I tweeted this.
[08:52.990 --> 08:55.030]  I tweeted this the day before.
[08:55.030 --> 08:58.570]  And it just builds.
[08:59.110 --> 09:01.750]  The amount of, as I said before, the rakes I stepped on.
[09:01.990 --> 09:04.490]  I tweeted, I quote tweeted the tease.
[09:04.730 --> 09:10.650]  And I said, as much as you may think you know what's coming, I promise you aren't close.
[09:10.970 --> 09:13.670]  I'm so excited for tomorrow. It's absolutely ridiculous.
[09:15.010 --> 09:16.150]  Oh my god.
[09:16.690 --> 09:17.750]  Continuing the chain.
[09:18.270 --> 09:22.730]  I'm just imagining people at Warner discover it, just being like, does he know?
[09:22.950 --> 09:23.790]  Does he know what's coming?
[09:24.650 --> 09:26.310]  Why is he so pumped about it?
[09:28.050 --> 09:32.870]  So that's that. And Geoff knows this, and maybe Geoff, I'd love to see the results of this.
[09:33.690 --> 09:36.410]  I forgot I did this. I'm watching an all-hands meeting.
[09:36.570 --> 09:43.310]  I'm crying. And then I get a notification on my phone that your DoorDash order had been picked up.
[09:43.830 --> 09:48.450]  I, the night prior, because we were going to record that day,
[09:48.450 --> 09:53.990]  scheduled for the following day, a burger order from McDonald's for Geoff,
[09:54.390 --> 10:00.630]  that had everything removed but salt, and then double salt, like we talked about before.
[10:00.970 --> 10:05.730]  So in the midst of just being devastated, I then had to reach out to Geoff,
[10:06.730 --> 10:13.270]  and explain the salt from McDonald's, I believe, to see if that was a thing.
[10:13.270 --> 10:19.830]  It arrived, I was too busy at Rooster Teeth saying goodbye to all of the people that I love and care about,
[10:20.230 --> 10:25.470]  because I was losing my job, but when I got home, I had a McDonald's package waiting for me.
[10:25.530 --> 10:26.850]  It was such a nice surprise.
[10:27.050 --> 10:28.570]  Had the salt gone cold by then?
[10:29.890 --> 10:32.450]  It didn't arrive in the way he thinks it did.
[10:33.050 --> 10:36.950]  Here, hold on, I took, I had the presence of mind to take a picture before I threw it away.
[10:37.790 --> 10:39.750]  Even though I was pretty out of my head yesterday.
[10:39.970 --> 10:41.430]  Let me see, where did I put it?
[10:41.430 --> 10:43.770]  What do you mean threw it away? You didn't use the salt?
[10:44.130 --> 10:46.290]  Uh, I'll show you.
[10:47.310 --> 10:48.650]  Here's what came.
[10:51.090 --> 10:54.410]  They sent me this image.
[10:54.910 --> 10:58.530]  So plain, extra salt, no regular meat, no bun.
[10:59.010 --> 10:59.530]  Right?
[11:01.550 --> 11:02.950]  And here's what I got.
[11:03.850 --> 11:04.230]  What?
[11:04.550 --> 11:06.030]  Oh, what the fuck?
[11:07.130 --> 11:08.790]  They always send the meat.
[11:08.990 --> 11:10.590]  I don't think they're allowed to take the meat out.
[11:10.590 --> 11:12.210]  I got a hamburger patty.
[11:12.410 --> 11:14.590]  And nothing else, audience, if you haven't seen the image yet.
[11:14.670 --> 11:16.730]  It's just a fucking, and I didn't get any salt.
[11:17.070 --> 11:17.750]  To my knowledge.
[11:20.850 --> 11:22.950]  Andrew's so quiet because he's angry, he's fuming.
[11:25.050 --> 11:26.970]  He's on the phone to McDonald's right now.
[11:26.990 --> 11:30.290]  He is right now, he's calling the ghost of Ray Kroc to complain.
[11:30.430 --> 11:31.130]  Oh, he left.
[11:31.930 --> 11:33.450]  No, I can't believe it.
[11:33.830 --> 11:36.490]  Sorry, did you try to print something?
[11:36.630 --> 11:37.770]  Did you print your severance?
[11:37.770 --> 11:40.430]  Everyone sounded like I was printing the loss.
[11:40.610 --> 11:43.350]  I had to reboot my audio setup very quickly.
[11:43.450 --> 11:44.350]  Hello, this is Eric.
[11:45.070 --> 11:45.950]  That's terrible.
[11:46.130 --> 11:46.550]  Hey, what's up?
[11:47.510 --> 11:49.730]  Somebody want to tell Eric to mute?
[11:50.010 --> 11:51.330]  Eric, you're not muted.
[11:52.150 --> 11:53.170]  Eric, for God's sake.
[11:53.930 --> 11:55.290]  First of all, Eric, you're not muted.
[11:55.570 --> 11:59.770]  Second of all, how dare you take a call in the middle of the podcast?
[12:00.130 --> 12:01.590]  Hey, what's up? How's it going?
[12:01.810 --> 12:03.970]  Oh, nothing. Nah, I'm not busy.
[12:04.370 --> 12:05.130]  Busy with what?
[12:05.130 --> 12:07.250]  It's just chaos around here.
[12:07.350 --> 12:11.490]  I imagine people coming in behind us and pulling filing cabinets out of the rooms.
[12:12.750 --> 12:13.750]  Oh, man.
[12:14.050 --> 12:14.810]  Thank you, Nick.
[12:15.030 --> 12:16.170]  Jesus Christ.
[12:16.770 --> 12:18.230]  They once again sent the patty.
[12:18.430 --> 12:20.510]  They refused to not, even though it's an option,
[12:20.970 --> 12:22.310]  they sent the meat to complain.
[12:26.630 --> 12:28.890]  He just called Eric a moron.
[12:31.770 --> 12:34.170]  That's the funniest moment of 2024.
[12:35.810 --> 12:38.930]  Gracie's gloves flew off the second we found out the company was gone.
[12:39.310 --> 12:40.290]  God damn.
[12:40.450 --> 12:43.590]  We're getting unfiltered Gracie now.
[12:44.070 --> 12:45.630]  Gracie, what do you really think of Eric?
[12:47.930 --> 12:49.230]  He's not your boss anymore.
[12:49.230 --> 12:51.730]  Yeah, we know. Eric, you fucking idiot.
[12:51.910 --> 12:53.510]  He just said sorry on the phone with Funhaus.
[12:53.630 --> 12:54.510]  We know.
[12:54.930 --> 12:55.970]  We're aware.
[12:58.890 --> 12:59.850]  Jesus Christ.
[12:59.970 --> 13:02.870]  I don't know if this is as funny as it feels
[13:02.870 --> 13:05.190]  or if we're all just so fucked up right now.
[13:05.310 --> 13:06.190]  Everything is...
[13:06.190 --> 13:07.890]  Our emotions are all over the place.
[13:07.950 --> 13:09.230]  But God, I can't stop laughing.
[13:10.950 --> 13:11.810]  Fucking hell.
[13:11.970 --> 13:14.610]  Can I continue with how I fucked up?
[13:14.710 --> 13:16.630]  How I fucked everything for everybody?
[13:16.990 --> 13:17.190]  Yeah.
[13:18.030 --> 13:19.770]  I've been in the works.
[13:20.070 --> 13:21.530]  You guys don't know about this.
[13:21.730 --> 13:25.110]  I've been planning a little thing with Tony
[13:25.110 --> 13:27.490]  for literally months now.
[13:27.630 --> 13:29.570]  Tony, the genius behind our merch.
[13:30.330 --> 13:31.130]  You may remember
[13:31.750 --> 13:32.110]  year...
[13:32.530 --> 13:34.210]  Not years. I don't know why I said years.
[13:34.390 --> 13:36.170]  Feels like years. This week has felt like years.
[13:36.930 --> 13:39.190]  Months ago, I pitched an idea
[13:39.190 --> 13:41.090]  on the show that I talked about with Tony.
[13:41.310 --> 13:42.390]  And you guys were like,
[13:42.450 --> 13:43.690]  yeah, we'll do that.
[13:43.850 --> 13:46.210]  There wasn't a lot of you're like whatever
[13:46.210 --> 13:47.310]  type feel to it.
[13:47.530 --> 13:49.770]  Where we each would come up with our own products
[13:50.150 --> 13:51.750]  and then have Tony make them.
[13:51.870 --> 13:53.290]  Or see if they were doable.
[13:53.790 --> 13:54.670]  And then proceed with them.
[13:55.350 --> 13:56.750]  And so I did that. It was sort of an
[13:56.750 --> 13:58.550]  eh, reaction by you two.
[13:59.150 --> 14:00.570]  And then some time passed.
[14:00.670 --> 14:02.650]  And then Tony reached out again and said
[14:02.650 --> 14:03.050]  hey,
[14:04.330 --> 14:06.770]  do you want to proceed with this
[14:06.770 --> 14:08.690]  idea? It didn't seem like
[14:08.690 --> 14:10.610]  a big moment on the show, but is this something you'd like to do?
[14:10.650 --> 14:11.630]  And I said absolutely.
[14:12.390 --> 14:14.190]  I just need to think of a thing
[14:14.630 --> 14:16.050]  that I think is worth making.
[14:16.230 --> 14:18.930]  What is specific to this show?
[14:19.270 --> 14:20.810]  What is something that I'd actually
[14:20.810 --> 14:22.510]  want? And what is
[14:22.510 --> 14:24.750]  a unique thing to enter
[14:24.750 --> 14:26.070]  into the marketplace with?
[14:26.610 --> 14:27.950]  And I thought about this for a long time.
[14:28.890 --> 14:30.610]  If your idea is
[14:30.610 --> 14:32.370]  what I came up with,
[14:32.950 --> 14:34.430]  I pitched an idea to Tony.
[14:34.870 --> 14:36.430]  I had to realize, my thought was
[14:36.430 --> 14:38.750]  what is a thing everyone could
[14:38.750 --> 14:40.790]  use? And what is something
[14:40.790 --> 14:41.890]  that is related to us?
[14:42.130 --> 14:44.210]  Something that I've never seen before.
[14:44.490 --> 14:46.650]  I don't think this is a product that has ever
[14:46.650 --> 14:48.610]  existed. Let me introduce
[14:48.610 --> 14:50.830]  to you and the audience
[14:50.830 --> 14:52.030]  the one
[14:52.030 --> 14:53.990]  and only, well
[14:53.990 --> 14:54.990]  we'll get to that actually.
[14:55.750 --> 14:58.250]  This is the clog tube.
[14:58.810 --> 14:59.790]  I made
[14:59.790 --> 15:01.410]  my pitch was
[15:01.410 --> 15:04.030]  a plunger
[15:04.030 --> 15:06.030]  where the groan tube is
[15:06.030 --> 15:08.070]  a stick and the
[15:08.070 --> 15:09.730]  bottom part is the plunge.
[15:10.630 --> 15:12.070]  Oh god
[15:12.070 --> 15:13.990]  damn. When do you ever turn a
[15:13.990 --> 15:15.230]  plunger upside down though?
[15:15.470 --> 15:18.010]  When you have the plunger in and you're trying to
[15:18.010 --> 15:20.230]  unclog and you're going up and down
[15:20.230 --> 15:22.210]  it's making the noise from
[15:22.210 --> 15:24.750]  the force of you pushing up and down on it.
[15:24.770 --> 15:25.850]  That is... Wow!
[15:26.610 --> 15:28.050]  Such a brilliant idea.
[15:28.450 --> 15:30.270]  I would love to hear
[15:30.270 --> 15:32.370]  what that's like with all the water clogging
[15:32.370 --> 15:33.670]  and glugging. Well
[15:34.230 --> 15:36.210]  let's see if these videos might be too
[15:36.210 --> 15:37.990]  big. I have videos
[15:37.990 --> 15:40.250]  that I could put in. Of you clogging
[15:40.250 --> 15:42.090]  a toilet? No, of
[15:42.990 --> 15:44.370]  let's see, it's not playing right now.
[15:44.670 --> 15:46.010]  These are tests
[15:46.010 --> 15:48.310]  from the warehouse where they had to
[15:48.310 --> 15:50.190]  prototype this thing. Because it's obviously a
[15:50.190 --> 15:52.230]  problem of it's about an air... There we go!
[15:52.490 --> 15:54.350]  That's one of the videos if you guys want to watch that.
[15:54.350 --> 15:54.950]  Alright, I'm going to play this.
[15:57.090 --> 15:58.110]  So it's a person
[15:58.110 --> 16:00.390]  So how it works is the groan tube would be separated
[16:00.390 --> 16:02.590]  and you twist tie it. Insane.
[16:03.290 --> 16:04.250]  This is insane.
[16:05.290 --> 16:06.470]  Andrew, what the
[16:06.470 --> 16:08.130]  fuck? And then
[16:08.830 --> 16:10.410]  as you go to
[16:10.410 --> 16:11.790]  as you go to unclog
[16:14.150 --> 16:16.330]  Do you think you can start associating the
[16:16.330 --> 16:18.050]  sound with just
[16:18.050 --> 16:20.230]  everything that it feels like while you try
[16:20.230 --> 16:22.310]  to unclog the toilet? Like a Pavlovian
[16:22.310 --> 16:23.970]  response. Every time you hear a groan tube you just go
[16:23.970 --> 16:25.710]  oh no. Diarrhea.
[16:25.710 --> 16:28.150]  We could get this into Walmart. We could save the company.
[16:29.530 --> 16:29.970]  Where
[16:29.970 --> 16:32.130]  was this idea three months ago?
[16:32.510 --> 16:34.090]  It's been in the works
[16:34.090 --> 16:36.170]  and we're going to get to that. I had a whole thing
[16:36.170 --> 16:38.150]  planned. One of the only people that
[16:38.150 --> 16:40.250]  knew about this was TPG
[16:40.250 --> 16:42.250]  I was going to... TPG was going
[16:42.250 --> 16:44.150]  to get one this month and he was
[16:44.150 --> 16:45.670]  going to shoot a commercial for it
[16:45.670 --> 16:47.910]  and that was going to be part of the reveal
[16:47.910 --> 16:49.610]  and then once I had the commercial
[16:49.970 --> 16:51.870]  I planned on going to a bunch of hardware
[16:51.870 --> 16:53.910]  stores and trying to pitch them
[16:53.910 --> 16:56.110]  this product as a thing that they should
[16:56.110 --> 16:58.250]  have just to get their reaction
[16:58.250 --> 16:59.490]  to it which I'm sure
[16:59.490 --> 17:00.910]  would have been amazing
[17:02.070 --> 17:03.310]  So based on these videos
[17:03.310 --> 17:06.430]  the pressure of the water does absolutely nothing for the groan tube.
[17:07.650 --> 17:07.830]  No.
[17:07.930 --> 17:10.250]  It's just shaking it. It's just shaking it
[17:10.250 --> 17:12.190]  but I don't know how often you're
[17:12.190 --> 17:14.210]  clogging toilets, Gavin. You could require
[17:14.210 --> 17:16.530]  some force. There could be some bouncing going on.
[17:16.850 --> 17:18.310]  You know, I've never been good at
[17:18.310 --> 17:20.030]  plunging. Well now it'll be fun.
[17:20.670 --> 17:21.550]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[17:22.210 --> 17:23.270]  This gives me a question.
[17:23.770 --> 17:26.550]  First off, by the way, Andrew, A++++
[17:26.550 --> 17:28.130]  idea. This may be
[17:28.130 --> 17:30.390]  your best... this may be the best invention
[17:30.390 --> 17:31.810]  in the history of f***face
[17:31.810 --> 17:34.670]  but how... like if we had a contest
[17:36.630 --> 17:38.470]  do you think we could pull off
[17:38.470 --> 17:40.330]  a contest to see who could clog a toilet
[17:40.330 --> 17:41.910]  first? Jesus Christ.
[17:42.450 --> 17:43.430]  And like...
[17:44.050 --> 17:46.570]  Like if we all agreed we're gonna start right now
[17:46.570 --> 17:48.250]  like we start right now
[17:48.250 --> 17:50.510]  and then whoever can clog a toilet first
[17:50.510 --> 17:52.370]  I could clog a toilet in 10 seconds.
[17:52.730 --> 17:54.710]  Do you have enough shit in you right now?
[17:54.930 --> 17:55.730]  Oh, as if it was shit?
[17:56.130 --> 17:58.350]  Yeah, dude, come on. I'm not just telling you to go stuff
[17:58.350 --> 18:00.410]  toilet paper. I could put a f***ing phone book on my
[18:00.410 --> 18:02.450]  toilet. It's dead. Well the toilet paper's what
[18:02.450 --> 18:04.050]  blocks the toilet. You can't block a toilet
[18:04.050 --> 18:06.630]  surely with just feces. It takes feces.
[18:06.730 --> 18:08.030]  Listen, I have a toto
[18:08.030 --> 18:09.950]  that cleans my little asshole
[18:09.950 --> 18:11.890]  with warm water every day
[18:11.890 --> 18:13.770]  and I still manage to clog that motherf***er
[18:13.770 --> 18:15.930]  once a week probably. It's possible.
[18:16.290 --> 18:17.490]  You're not using any bog roll?
[18:18.050 --> 18:19.030]  I use bog roll.
[18:19.570 --> 18:20.630]  A little bit.
[18:21.430 --> 18:23.950]  If you have a big enough pile
[18:23.950 --> 18:25.770]  of turd and bog roll
[18:25.770 --> 18:27.090]  you're gonna clog a toilet.
[18:27.590 --> 18:29.710]  I don't think I can clog
[18:29.710 --> 18:31.490]  any of my toilets with just turd.
[18:31.590 --> 18:33.550]  Here's why. You have baby shits.
[18:33.730 --> 18:35.010]  You wouldn't win this contest.
[18:35.010 --> 18:36.790]  I was about to say, Geoff,
[18:36.850 --> 18:38.710]  this whole thing is from your insane
[18:38.710 --> 18:40.890]  perspective of shitting where you're like
[18:40.890 --> 18:42.690]  if I gave you 10 seconds right now
[18:42.690 --> 18:44.890]  that is a thing that anyone could just do.
[18:45.210 --> 18:46.070]  Shit on command.
[18:46.490 --> 18:48.970]  So if you are concerned about
[18:48.970 --> 18:51.050]  the future of f***face and what
[18:51.050 --> 18:53.030]  it really means now that we're all out of a
[18:53.030 --> 18:54.990]  job, don't worry. It's exactly the
[18:54.990 --> 18:56.930]  same. This is the f***ing
[18:56.930 --> 18:58.750]  most deranged conversation
[18:58.750 --> 19:01.150]  I think we've done in almost 200 episodes.
[19:01.530 --> 19:02.910]  This is f***ing wild, guys.
[19:02.910 --> 19:04.970]  What are you doing? This is nuts.
[19:05.090 --> 19:06.870]  Coming from the guy who was just on the phone
[19:06.870 --> 19:08.930]  in the middle of it. I didn't have a choice.
[19:09.830 --> 19:11.170]  I'm trying to jump ship.
[19:14.970 --> 19:16.810]  The argument here is that
[19:16.810 --> 19:18.990]  you would have a contest where you take
[19:18.990 --> 19:20.850]  the biggest shit. No
[19:20.850 --> 19:22.910]  bog roll. No, I
[19:22.910 --> 19:24.870]  think you can use bog roll. I'm not saying you
[19:24.870 --> 19:27.070]  can't use bog roll. That's Gavin's weirdness.
[19:27.370 --> 19:29.150]  I think you take a shit like normally.
[19:29.930 --> 19:30.810]  I'm just saying like
[19:30.810 --> 19:32.650]  because you'd have to eat a bunch, right?
[19:32.690 --> 19:34.410]  What do I have to eat to shit bad?
[19:34.490 --> 19:36.830]  So that I can shit so much and make such
[19:36.830 --> 19:38.830]  a messy doo-doo that I need enough
[19:38.830 --> 19:40.710]  toilet paper to clean it up that it
[19:40.710 --> 19:42.670]  clogs the toilet. That's the
[19:42.670 --> 19:43.330]  contest.
[19:44.370 --> 19:46.370]  What can you do to your body
[19:46.370 --> 19:48.830]  to make a doo-doo so bad
[19:48.830 --> 19:50.010]  it clogs a toilet?
[19:51.090 --> 19:52.290]  And who can do it first?
[19:52.810 --> 19:54.830]  I mean, bananas and stuff really stop you up, don't
[19:54.830 --> 19:56.650]  they? Yeah. Maybe a banana
[19:56.650 --> 19:58.830]  turd would be really compacted.
[19:58.830 --> 20:00.830]  It's certainly worth checking
[20:00.830 --> 20:02.770]  out, investigating. How many
[20:02.770 --> 20:04.770]  bananas do you have to eat before you get
[20:04.770 --> 20:05.890]  a cloggy turd?
[20:05.930 --> 20:08.430]  It depends on your plumbing.
[20:08.870 --> 20:10.550]  Yeah, we would need
[20:10.550 --> 20:12.270]  toilet consistency, I guess.
[20:12.570 --> 20:14.830]  It would be a whole thing. But to continue
[20:14.830 --> 20:16.590]  on... I'm sorry, just real quick.
[20:16.810 --> 20:18.770]  You wanted to pitch this
[20:18.770 --> 20:20.670]  to... you would just go to like
[20:20.670 --> 20:22.510]  Home Depot and be like, guys, you gotta get this?
[20:23.190 --> 20:24.890]  I don't understand what you're asking.
[20:25.310 --> 20:26.730]  I understand. He said you were gonna
[20:26.730 --> 20:28.710]  He's saying, Andrew was saying he was gonna go to
[20:28.710 --> 20:30.550]  hardware stores around town. Yeah, yeah, I already
[20:30.550 --> 20:32.530]  talked about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's gonna...
[20:32.530 --> 20:32.970]  But I...
[20:32.970 --> 20:36.890]  I just... I don't foresee...
[20:36.890 --> 20:38.430]  Okay, that's fine. We can move on.
[20:38.530 --> 20:40.470]  I'm trying to think of you as like a Glen Gary
[20:40.470 --> 20:42.490]  Glen Ross style salesman. No, no, no.
[20:42.570 --> 20:43.610]  It would just... No.
[20:44.250 --> 20:46.730]  I got a trench coat with all the... That's exactly
[20:46.730 --> 20:48.690]  what I'm picturing! I'm getting chased
[20:48.690 --> 20:50.510]  out of the Home Depot and it's making
[20:50.510 --> 20:52.010]  all the noise as I'm trying to run away.
[20:54.090 --> 20:54.630]  Andrew's like
[20:54.630 --> 20:56.690]  John Candy in Plane Trains and Automobiles.
[20:56.810 --> 20:58.290]  He just travels the country as a salesman. Yeah, that's a great
[20:58.290 --> 21:00.670]  comparable. But here's the
[21:00.670 --> 21:01.730]  problem with all this.
[21:02.150 --> 21:04.770]  This has been in the works. They've been innovations.
[21:04.950 --> 21:06.190]  There's a prototype that exists.
[21:06.750 --> 21:08.730]  We are getting... These were supposed
[21:08.730 --> 21:10.290]  to arrive in May,
[21:10.750 --> 21:11.550]  which I assume
[21:13.210 --> 21:14.410]  is post
[21:14.410 --> 21:15.770]  company death.
[21:16.410 --> 21:18.450]  And there's 500 of them.
[21:18.750 --> 21:19.070]  No!
[21:20.770 --> 21:22.770]  Wait. There are 500
[21:22.770 --> 21:24.870]  clog tubes en route
[21:24.870 --> 21:26.830]  that are... Is this why the company went under?
[21:27.730 --> 21:28.790]  I think it was Ratty
[21:28.790 --> 21:30.750]  Boy. It was the cost. You and
[21:30.750 --> 21:32.950]  Tony in complete secrecy
[21:32.950 --> 21:34.830]  that Gavin and Eric and I don't
[21:34.830 --> 21:37.150]  know about, you in complete secrecy
[21:37.150 --> 21:38.770]  manufactured 500
[21:38.770 --> 21:40.890]  clog tubes? Yes. We were probably
[21:40.890 --> 21:42.530]  quite profitable before you did that.
[21:42.830 --> 21:44.830]  That's the coolest thing I've ever
[21:44.830 --> 21:47.050]  heard. I don't care. That's awesome.
[21:48.590 --> 21:49.070]  It was...
[21:49.070 --> 21:50.810]  My whole plan was to unveil this
[21:50.810 --> 21:52.470]  when they were available to buy
[21:52.470 --> 21:54.770]  in May. Obviously, things
[21:54.770 --> 21:56.810]  have changed, so it feels
[21:56.810 --> 21:58.690]  worth talking about now. But once again,
[21:58.970 --> 22:00.850]  my fault of trying to plan for the
[22:00.850 --> 22:02.410]  future in a dragon year
[22:02.990 --> 22:04.730]  and there's just 500
[22:04.730 --> 22:06.870]  clog tubes that I don't know
[22:06.870 --> 22:08.850]  where they're gonna go, I don't
[22:08.850 --> 22:10.910]  know what'll happen with them, but
[22:10.910 --> 22:12.770]  they exist. I love that
[22:12.770 --> 22:14.810]  when a company ends, there's always
[22:14.810 --> 22:16.350]  like a department of
[22:16.350 --> 22:18.470]  the parent company that comes in and
[22:18.470 --> 22:20.070]  takes inventory and audits
[22:20.070 --> 22:21.830]  but they're just gonna find
[22:22.470 --> 22:24.150]  500 drone plungers.
[22:24.950 --> 22:26.570]  It doesn't end there
[22:26.570 --> 22:28.450]  either, cause as you
[22:28.450 --> 22:30.730]  I think we've talked about, I don't know if we've revealed this
[22:30.730 --> 22:32.470]  in the show, we also
[22:32.470 --> 22:34.210]  made our own
[22:34.210 --> 22:36.450]  extendable thumbsticks with
[22:36.450 --> 22:38.050]  the idea of people
[22:38.050 --> 22:39.990]  able to buy them
[22:39.990 --> 22:42.450]  and do them simultaneously while we
[22:42.450 --> 22:44.350]  were doing the challenge. We innovated
[22:44.350 --> 22:46.450]  the product. Also, I believe
[22:46.450 --> 22:48.370]  arriving in May, and there are
[22:48.370 --> 22:50.550]  500 of those as well
[22:50.550 --> 22:51.970]  on the way
[22:52.750 --> 22:53.710]  to somewhere.
[22:54.050 --> 22:56.110]  Alright, well, if anybody
[22:56.730 --> 22:58.470]  really wondered what it was that
[22:58.470 --> 23:00.490]  finally sank Rooster Teeth, I think it should be pretty
[23:00.490 --> 23:02.490]  clear. The recipe
[23:02.490 --> 23:03.710]  book didn't come out either, did it?
[23:03.950 --> 23:05.970]  No, it comes out next month.
[23:06.210 --> 23:08.070]  How many of those have we got? I don't know.
[23:08.610 --> 23:09.430]  Probably 500.
[23:10.130 --> 23:12.450]  I have no clue. God, that sucks. I hope that
[23:12.450 --> 23:14.230]  comes out. We put so much work into that.
[23:14.230 --> 23:15.650]  Tony put so much work into that.
[23:15.770 --> 23:18.370]  The amount of stuff that was coming was ridiculous.
[23:18.950 --> 23:19.430]  Yeah.
[23:20.090 --> 23:22.350]  The other things that, uh, my fault
[23:22.350 --> 23:24.430]  as well, I, uh...
[23:25.310 --> 23:26.330]  I also love
[23:26.330 --> 23:27.350]  we gotta keep the audience
[23:28.810 --> 23:30.090]  just the fact that you're a
[23:30.090 --> 23:32.050]  contractor too. You never
[23:32.050 --> 23:34.130]  set foot in the building, just doing this
[23:34.130 --> 23:36.150]  entirely part-time from
[23:36.150 --> 23:38.190]  a different country. This motherfucker is just
[23:38.190 --> 23:39.850]  pulling strings from Canada and
[23:39.850 --> 23:42.030]  they're just unraveling
[23:43.250 --> 23:43.770]  everything
[23:43.770 --> 23:44.890]  around us.
[23:47.190 --> 23:49.490]  You know what's a great thing to do
[23:49.810 --> 23:51.830]  the day that the company announces
[23:51.830 --> 23:53.910]  it dies? Is release
[23:53.910 --> 23:56.070]  a month-long trivia tournament
[23:56.070 --> 23:57.230]  that will air
[23:57.230 --> 23:59.150]  the rest of the month.
[23:59.870 --> 24:01.990]  To find out who's the smartest of
[24:01.990 --> 24:03.830]  the now dumb unemployed people.
[24:05.890 --> 24:07.810]  I think it shows. We had all this stuff
[24:07.810 --> 24:09.590]  in the works. I feel like we'd finally
[24:09.590 --> 24:11.250]  really hit our stride. We were just
[24:11.250 --> 24:12.910]  firing off all cylinders.
[24:13.290 --> 24:15.990]  In all seriousness, that's...
[24:15.990 --> 24:17.530]  I mean, this thing is
[24:17.530 --> 24:19.390]  beyond frustrating in a million different ways, but
[24:19.390 --> 24:21.330]  from a creativity standpoint
[24:21.330 --> 24:23.470]  it's frustrating because I
[24:23.470 --> 24:25.250]  agree, Gav. I really feel like
[24:25.250 --> 24:27.630]  from the moment we filled that whiteboard
[24:27.630 --> 24:28.830]  out in January
[24:29.450 --> 24:31.690]  or December, whatever it was, I just feel
[24:31.690 --> 24:33.430]  like things hit another gear.
[24:34.050 --> 24:35.230]  And we've just been...
[24:35.230 --> 24:36.550]  We turned Let's Play around.
[24:36.550 --> 24:37.930]  We did, dude.
[24:38.030 --> 24:40.550]  We didn't even...
[24:41.550 --> 24:42.510]  We did...
[24:42.510 --> 24:44.790]  The good news
[24:44.790 --> 24:46.370]  about the tournament is it's done.
[24:47.190 --> 24:48.630]  Like, we filmed everything.
[24:49.290 --> 24:50.610]  There is an end to that.
[24:50.810 --> 24:52.570]  At least. Does it end
[24:52.570 --> 24:54.010]  off to the end of the company?
[24:54.470 --> 24:56.110]  No. No, it doesn't.
[24:56.330 --> 24:57.770]  It goes through the end of March.
[24:58.230 --> 25:00.110]  So that'll all be seen.
[25:00.370 --> 25:02.650]  We get all our does-it-dos out as well, right?
[25:02.990 --> 25:04.470]  I assume so. We have
[25:04.470 --> 25:06.450]  an amazing trophy for it as well.
[25:08.030 --> 25:10.150]  You haven't seen this yet. Geoff,
[25:10.210 --> 25:11.670]  Gracie, just sent this to me. It arrived.
[25:11.870 --> 25:13.830]  The Ratty Boy! Aww, that's awesome!
[25:14.770 --> 25:15.970]  It was going to be our tournament
[25:16.450 --> 25:18.350]  trophy. It's a hunk of cheese.
[25:18.730 --> 25:20.070]  And it says The Ratty Boy on it.
[25:20.450 --> 25:22.310]  Is that real cheese? No.
[25:22.990 --> 25:24.210]  But it kind of looks like
[25:24.210 --> 25:26.530]  that shitty Kraft Single
[25:26.530 --> 25:28.410]  type cheese. That's awesome.
[25:28.710 --> 25:29.950]  We took it out of the box
[25:30.470 --> 25:32.570]  and I really
[25:32.570 --> 25:34.570]  thought it was a huge piece
[25:34.570 --> 25:36.430]  like real fucking cheese
[25:36.430 --> 25:38.270]  that somebody glued to this thing and I just went,
[25:38.430 --> 25:40.730]  what are we making? What are we doing?
[25:41.150 --> 25:42.190]  But no, it's
[25:42.890 --> 25:43.770]  fake, apparently.
[25:44.470 --> 25:46.570]  Well, to that end, can I just
[25:46.570 --> 25:48.670]  say, Andrew, just since you've
[25:48.670 --> 25:50.690]  been admitting to having so much
[25:50.690 --> 25:52.610]  stuff going on in the background that we weren't aware of that is just
[25:52.610 --> 25:54.510]  so impressive, I was in the
[25:55.030 --> 25:56.670]  slow process of pranking
[25:56.670 --> 25:58.410]  you. I'd been working on it for a while.
[25:59.230 --> 25:59.670]  And
[26:00.310 --> 26:01.630]  I haven't done it yet.
[26:01.750 --> 26:03.610]  I was still putting it all together and I
[26:03.610 --> 26:05.450]  wasn't in a hurry, but
[26:05.990 --> 26:07.870]  I guess I'm still
[26:07.870 --> 26:09.050]  going to get you, you motherfucker.
[26:09.850 --> 26:11.510]  You'll just see it coming now
[26:11.510 --> 26:13.610]  at some point. It probably won't be
[26:13.610 --> 26:14.750]  while you work at Rooster Teeth, though.
[26:17.050 --> 26:17.770]  Can I
[26:17.770 --> 26:19.570]  say the one positive that
[26:19.570 --> 26:20.790]  I've taken from
[26:21.350 --> 26:23.070]  what has happened this past week?
[26:23.230 --> 26:25.530]  The one joy I've found is
[26:26.250 --> 26:27.870]  an ongoing bit in the show
[26:27.870 --> 26:29.870]  that has haunted me, is
[26:29.870 --> 26:30.890]  having to eat the pencil.
[26:31.570 --> 26:33.750]  The pencil trial
[26:33.750 --> 26:35.650]  that was so
[26:35.650 --> 26:37.750]  poorly received,
[26:38.390 --> 26:39.010]  there was
[26:39.870 --> 26:41.810]  discussions internally about having to
[26:41.810 --> 26:43.630]  make a statement about it, not realizing
[26:43.630 --> 26:45.590]  what people were upset about.
[26:46.770 --> 26:47.730]  That's something I've
[26:47.730 --> 26:49.270]  carried for a long time.
[26:49.970 --> 26:51.670]  Just the fact that I was
[26:51.670 --> 26:53.730]  really, really led the way
[26:53.730 --> 26:55.790]  on what is the least well
[26:55.790 --> 26:57.890]  received bit that this show ever had,
[26:58.090 --> 26:59.730]  and I can now sleep
[26:59.730 --> 27:01.890]  better at night knowing that
[27:01.890 --> 27:03.490]  that is no longer the case
[27:03.490 --> 27:05.810]  because Warner fucking hated that you're
[27:05.810 --> 27:07.990]  not going to know when 1.96 arrives
[27:07.990 --> 27:10.170]  bit. They were not a fan
[27:10.170 --> 27:11.570]  at all
[27:11.570 --> 27:13.870]  of that one. We released
[27:13.870 --> 27:14.930]  that, and
[27:16.710 --> 27:17.870]  hours later,
[27:18.070 --> 27:19.970]  the outrage of not knowing
[27:19.970 --> 27:21.770]  of when 1.96 would happen.
[27:21.910 --> 27:23.670]  So I'm going to take 90% of the
[27:23.670 --> 27:25.670]  responsibility, but I also feel like
[27:25.670 --> 27:27.610]  that bit did damage clearly. I think it's an
[27:27.610 --> 27:29.010]  undeniable connection.
[27:29.010 --> 27:31.290]  I'll take the hit on that.
[27:31.410 --> 27:33.150]  That one was my idea. I'll take the
[27:33.490 --> 27:35.350]  10% hit on releasing
[27:35.350 --> 27:36.510]  1.96 out of sequence.
[27:37.290 --> 27:39.610]  While you take the 10% hit, can I
[27:39.610 --> 27:41.710]  interest you in a 10% discount
[27:41.710 --> 27:43.650]  on sticks or a
[27:43.650 --> 27:44.750]  clog tube? Because
[27:44.750 --> 27:46.470]  we got some to poop.
[27:48.370 --> 27:49.590]  In all seriousness,
[27:49.670 --> 27:51.590]  that is something that I guess we'll have to address
[27:51.590 --> 27:53.490]  and figure out with the
[27:53.490 --> 27:55.550]  company. What to do with the merchandise
[27:55.550 --> 27:57.810]  that has already been paid for and is already
[27:57.810 --> 27:58.350]  in route.
[27:59.630 --> 28:01.590]  Some of that stuff is probably on a very
[28:02.130 --> 28:03.810]  slow-moving boat
[28:03.810 --> 28:04.770]  from China right now.
[28:06.550 --> 28:07.270]  I'm hoping...
[28:07.270 --> 28:09.310]  It was like, hey, we get to go to America!
[28:09.450 --> 28:11.470]  We're going to go live a life in America. It's going to be so cool when we get there.
[28:11.530 --> 28:13.750]  And they get there and it's like, yeah, shut it down.
[28:13.990 --> 28:15.190]  Send it back. We're not interested.
[28:15.630 --> 28:16.410]  We're over.
[28:16.410 --> 28:16.510]  We're over.
[28:19.150 --> 28:20.490]  I would love
[28:20.490 --> 28:21.710]  and I don't know, we'll see
[28:21.710 --> 28:24.370]  the possibility of this. I would love
[28:24.370 --> 28:26.170]  to somehow personally maintain
[28:26.170 --> 28:27.850]  control of Ratty Boy,
[28:28.110 --> 28:30.190]  but if I don't, it is
[28:30.190 --> 28:32.270]  hilarious to me that Ratty Boy is a
[28:32.270 --> 28:33.290]  Warner Brothers entity.
[28:35.070 --> 28:35.950]  It's terrible!
[28:36.990 --> 28:37.350]  You know what?
[28:37.730 --> 28:39.810]  You know the one that popped into my head
[28:39.810 --> 28:42.030]  that kind of hurt? What?
[28:42.230 --> 28:44.010]  I thought like... And we can talk about
[28:44.010 --> 28:44.890]  at some point,
[28:44.950 --> 28:47.850]  what the future looks like for us. We don't know,
[28:47.950 --> 28:50.030]  but we've got some ideas and I think we can speak in some
[28:50.030 --> 28:51.990]  vagaries that'll be at least
[28:51.990 --> 28:53.030]  encouraging to the audience.
[28:53.850 --> 28:56.010]  But I realized, it's entirely
[28:56.010 --> 28:58.030]  possible that in the future we're doing
[28:58.030 --> 28:59.710]  this, but we don't have access to
[28:59.710 --> 29:01.130]  the previous IP.
[29:01.830 --> 29:04.050]  We might lose
[29:04.050 --> 29:05.910]  Gerpler. I love the fucking
[29:05.910 --> 29:06.390]  Gerpler.
[29:07.730 --> 29:10.170]  I don't want to say goodbye to the Gerpler.
[29:10.930 --> 29:12.130]  We might have to say goodbye to...
[29:12.130 --> 29:12.990]  We might lose Ian.
[29:14.790 --> 29:15.310]  No...
[29:15.310 --> 29:17.830]  Ian was from 4th grade.
[29:18.210 --> 29:19.490]  In my 4th grade class.
[29:19.690 --> 29:20.430]  I can't take Ian.
[29:21.990 --> 29:23.770]  I don't know if... Are you familiar
[29:23.770 --> 29:25.770]  with the Popsicle
[29:25.770 --> 29:27.610]  story with Frank Epperson?
[29:27.870 --> 29:29.830]  The guy that patented the Popsicle?
[29:30.650 --> 29:31.330]  Clearly not.
[29:31.330 --> 29:34.350]  The guy that made the Popsicle,
[29:34.430 --> 29:35.810]  he would get this drink mix
[29:35.810 --> 29:37.950]  and he invented the Popsicle as a kid
[29:37.950 --> 29:39.310]  because he got called in
[29:39.310 --> 29:41.270]  at night when he was drinking
[29:41.270 --> 29:43.330]  it on his front doorstep and
[29:43.330 --> 29:45.470]  then he left it overnight and it was frozen
[29:45.470 --> 29:47.150]  and it was like the first Popsicle, essentially.
[29:47.310 --> 29:49.450]  It became a thing that the family made
[29:49.450 --> 29:50.230]  every winter.
[29:51.210 --> 29:53.350]  And then eventually he got sued
[29:53.350 --> 29:54.810]  by another guy
[29:55.310 --> 29:57.390]  for ice cream. For claiming
[29:57.390 --> 29:59.330]  that the Popsicle fell under
[29:59.330 --> 30:01.310]  the patent of ice cream that the other guy had
[30:01.310 --> 30:02.770]  and Frank Epperson was like,
[30:03.110 --> 30:05.450]  fuck you, I invented this as a kid
[30:05.450 --> 30:06.250]  on my porch.
[30:07.050 --> 30:08.330]  That's how I feel about Ian.
[30:09.250 --> 30:10.650]  I'm taking Ian.
[30:10.990 --> 30:12.450]  Ian was in Mr. Herg's
[30:12.450 --> 30:13.530]  fourth grade class.
[30:14.070 --> 30:15.330]  They cannot have Ian.
[30:16.050 --> 30:16.930]  I refuse.
[30:18.830 --> 30:20.130]  They don't get it.
[30:20.550 --> 30:22.150]  The Warner lawyers just dealing with
[30:22.150 --> 30:23.610]  the lawyers of your old school.
[30:25.130 --> 30:26.430]  The Warner lawyers like,
[30:26.530 --> 30:28.170]  well, he seems pretty serious about it
[30:28.170 --> 30:29.190]  so I guess we better let it go.
[30:29.650 --> 30:31.850]  They don't want to tango with the
[30:31.850 --> 30:33.190]  Frank Nae Firebirds, okay?
[30:33.190 --> 30:34.690]  There's some heat
[30:34.690 --> 30:37.050]  coming for them if they
[30:37.050 --> 30:38.690]  tried to take Mr. Herg's
[30:38.690 --> 30:40.230]  drawing class.
[30:40.930 --> 30:43.070]  Yeah, that's
[30:43.070 --> 30:45.150]  wild. It is a wild
[30:45.150 --> 30:45.490]  week.
[30:45.890 --> 30:49.210]  I wanted to prepare something for today.
[30:50.330 --> 30:51.110]  I don't know.
[30:51.250 --> 30:52.510]  I just felt the need.
[30:53.090 --> 30:54.950]  I had a lot of nervous energy today
[30:54.950 --> 30:56.610]  and I was kind of climbing the walls
[30:56.610 --> 30:58.790]  and so I was trying to think of what I could do
[30:58.790 --> 31:01.590]  in two quick hours that could
[31:01.590 --> 31:03.010]  be a bit for the show.
[31:03.170 --> 31:05.570]  And then I remembered an old bit I did
[31:05.570 --> 31:07.670]  a while back and I thought maybe it would be fun
[31:07.670 --> 31:09.630]  to revisit it because I had just about the
[31:09.630 --> 31:10.590]  right amount of time.
[31:10.890 --> 31:13.610]  And so I thought, since it's Oscar season
[31:13.610 --> 31:15.590]  and there's a bunch of new
[31:15.590 --> 31:17.190]  movies that are up for awards
[31:17.190 --> 31:19.010]  and I used to do movie reviews
[31:19.010 --> 31:21.270]  and I looked, I thought
[31:21.270 --> 31:23.530]  maybe I'll review one of those movies
[31:24.850 --> 31:25.290]  that's
[31:25.290 --> 31:27.130]  nominated for an Oscar and then I can
[31:27.130 --> 31:29.270]  just have one last movie review
[31:29.270 --> 31:29.970]  kind of fun thing.
[31:30.370 --> 31:33.350]  And I figured, well maybe I've already seen all the Oscar movies
[31:33.350 --> 31:34.910]  let me look. I hadn't seen any of them.
[31:35.190 --> 31:37.310]  The only movie I saw was Barbie and apparently that got
[31:37.310 --> 31:39.410]  fucked out of Oscar nominations. So I hadn't seen
[31:39.410 --> 31:41.310]  like American Fiction or
[31:42.270 --> 31:42.990]  Oppenheimer or
[31:43.530 --> 31:44.850]  Killers of the Flower Moon
[31:44.850 --> 31:47.250]  or Napoleon. And I'm looking at all these
[31:47.250 --> 31:49.250]  movies and every one of those
[31:49.250 --> 31:51.010]  movies is 19
[31:51.590 --> 31:52.310]  hours long.
[31:52.790 --> 31:55.130]  And I was like, well I have less than two hours
[31:55.130 --> 31:57.110]  so I clearly can't do that. And then I thought
[31:57.110 --> 31:59.210]  it's kind of unfair to just pick
[31:59.210 --> 32:00.730]  one of these movies and review it
[32:00.730 --> 32:03.210]  that's up for Oscar contention. It's unfair to the rest
[32:03.210 --> 32:05.090]  of the movies so I should watch something
[32:05.090 --> 32:07.490]  different. And so I scoured
[32:08.110 --> 32:09.410]  the film archives
[32:09.410 --> 32:11.130]  and I landed on a movie
[32:11.870 --> 32:12.950]  called Woman
[32:12.950 --> 32:14.330]  with the Red Lipstick.
[32:14.870 --> 32:17.190]  A lifetime movie thriller from the
[32:17.190 --> 32:18.410]  year 2024
[32:19.810 --> 32:20.610]  about a
[32:20.610 --> 32:22.870]  woman journalist who
[32:22.870 --> 32:25.150]  she's a crime journalist. She writes stories
[32:25.150 --> 32:26.810]  about crime and does crime investigation.
[32:27.330 --> 32:28.890]  And she's got this hunky boyfriend
[32:29.310 --> 32:31.210]  and she's quite lovely herself. Her name is Lucy.
[32:31.790 --> 32:33.270]  And one night they're on a date
[32:33.270 --> 32:35.190]  and he's like, I got... That's it!
[32:35.210 --> 32:37.030]  That's the movie! Woman with the Red Lipstick. That's perfect.
[32:37.410 --> 32:38.910]  That's her hunky boyfriend. That's her, right?
[32:39.910 --> 32:41.130]  And he's like, no
[32:41.130 --> 32:42.330]  Christ isn't in it.
[32:42.570 --> 32:45.070]  And one night they go on a date
[32:45.070 --> 32:47.190]  and she can tell something's a little off with him
[32:47.190 --> 32:49.090]  and she's like, what's wrong man? And he's like,
[32:49.210 --> 32:50.970]  I just, do you just feel like we're getting a little
[32:50.970 --> 32:53.010]  rote? Like it's like the same thing over and over again.
[32:53.370 --> 32:55.070]  Don't you feel like maybe we need to spice
[32:55.070 --> 32:56.450]  up our love life a little bit?
[32:56.810 --> 32:59.190]  And she's like, I guess. What do you mean?
[32:59.670 --> 33:01.090]  And he's like, well, what if we
[33:01.090 --> 33:03.110]  did like a role play? What if we just do like a role play
[33:03.110 --> 33:04.730]  thing? And she's like, yeah, okay.
[33:04.890 --> 33:06.990]  Whatever. She's into it. She's like, she thinks it's
[33:06.990 --> 33:08.530]  a little weird, but she's like, yeah, I'll try a role play thing.
[33:08.830 --> 33:10.950]  So then she goes to work the next day or a couple days later
[33:11.430 --> 33:13.150]  and there's just a box on her desk
[33:13.150 --> 33:14.870]  on her desk, right? And the box has
[33:14.870 --> 33:16.850]  a wig in it and some red lipstick
[33:16.850 --> 33:18.950]  and a scarf and
[33:18.950 --> 33:20.970]  an identity. And then it's like
[33:20.970 --> 33:22.970]  put this on. Your name is
[33:22.970 --> 33:24.870]  Maggie. You're a such and such.
[33:25.370 --> 33:26.710]  Meet me at
[33:26.710 --> 33:29.030]  a bar at 10
[33:29.030 --> 33:31.050]  p.m. and just
[33:31.050 --> 33:33.070]  be there and have this drink. And she's
[33:33.070 --> 33:34.990]  like, okay, I'll do it. It's a little weird, but
[33:34.990 --> 33:37.010]  you know, I want to keep the romance alive. And so
[33:37.010 --> 33:39.090]  she puts it all on and she wears the special
[33:39.090 --> 33:40.890]  scarf and lipstick and everything
[33:40.890 --> 33:42.850]  and then her boyfriend shows up
[33:42.850 --> 33:44.990]  and he's in this like dumb red like college
[33:44.990 --> 33:46.970]  jacket and he's like, hey, I'm like a college
[33:46.970 --> 33:48.930]  dude. And so they're like flirting around
[33:48.930 --> 33:50.910]  and it's kind of funny and it's working, you know?
[33:51.190 --> 33:52.950]  She thinks it's a little weird, but it's working. And then he
[33:52.950 --> 33:55.010]  just gets this weird look in his face and he's like, the lipstick's wrong.
[33:55.110 --> 33:56.970]  I don't like the lipstick. Take it off. And she's like, that's
[33:56.970 --> 33:58.830]  weird. So she takes off the lipstick and then they continue
[33:58.830 --> 34:00.950]  and then they have awesome
[34:00.950 --> 34:02.890]  passionate sex and it works and
[34:02.890 --> 34:04.930]  everything's cool. She goes
[34:04.930 --> 34:07.030]  to work the next day. The fucking
[34:07.030 --> 34:08.650]  TV is on in the break room
[34:08.650 --> 34:10.830]  and there's a news report about
[34:10.830 --> 34:12.930]  this socialite. By the way, they live in
[34:12.930 --> 34:14.610]  Chicago. This all takes place in Chicago.
[34:15.170 --> 34:16.950]  Tons of great stock footage of
[34:16.950 --> 34:19.010]  Chicago. It's beautiful. Throughout the
[34:19.010 --> 34:21.110]  film. Maybe the best part of the movie is the stock footage.
[34:21.910 --> 34:22.730]  And so
[34:22.730 --> 34:24.330]  on the news report
[34:24.810 --> 34:26.390]  this is fucking crazy, this
[34:27.190 --> 34:29.010]  gorgeous socialite, who's just about her
[34:29.010 --> 34:30.890]  age, is disappeared.
[34:31.050 --> 34:32.970]  She's just not at home. Nobody's heard from
[34:32.970 --> 34:34.930]  her. Nobody knows where she is. They
[34:34.930 --> 34:37.110]  don't know if something's happened to her, if it's foul play
[34:37.110 --> 34:38.510]  or if she just left town.
[34:39.550 --> 34:40.930]  And a picture
[34:40.930 --> 34:42.750]  pops up. She just looks up and the
[34:42.750 --> 34:44.770]  socialite has blonde hair
[34:44.770 --> 34:46.930]  and has a scarf
[34:46.930 --> 34:48.830]  exactly like the scarf she put on
[34:48.830 --> 34:50.770]  last night. And the
[34:50.770 --> 34:52.210]  socialite's name is Maggie.
[34:53.730 --> 34:54.730]  Oh my
[34:54.730 --> 34:55.670]  God.
[34:57.930 --> 34:58.430]  Shit
[34:58.430 --> 35:00.710]  gets crazy from
[35:00.710 --> 35:02.790]  that point on. And I don't want to tell
[35:02.790 --> 35:04.970]  you anymore of it because it could spoil the whole
[35:04.970 --> 35:06.850]  movie. But if that sounds interesting
[35:06.850 --> 35:08.790]  to you, I would look
[35:08.790 --> 35:10.710]  out for Woman with the Red Lipstick, a
[35:10.710 --> 35:12.870]  2024 thriller from the Lifetime
[35:12.870 --> 35:13.570]  Movie Network.
[35:18.420 --> 35:20.560]  When you think about comedic duos
[35:20.560 --> 35:22.480]  in the past, you may think of people like
[35:22.480 --> 35:24.020]  Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy,
[35:24.500 --> 35:26.540]  King and Peele. They all have this
[35:26.540 --> 35:28.480]  very constant thread
[35:28.480 --> 35:30.440]  of setting up and delivering punchline.
[35:30.640 --> 35:32.000]  Which may make you wonder,

[39:03.500 --> 39:05.920]  slash face50 to get 50%
[39:05.920 --> 39:07.960]  off. Ever tried to
[39:07.960 --> 39:10.080]  break a bad habit and felt like you're climbing Everest
[39:10.080 --> 39:11.880]  and flip flops? Yeah, we've
[39:11.880 --> 39:13.880]  been there too. But here's the breath of
[39:13.880 --> 39:15.160]  fresh air. Fume.
[39:15.620 --> 39:18.000]  It's not about giving up, it's about switching
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.840]  up. Fume takes your habit
[39:19.840 --> 39:21.280]  and simply makes it better,
[39:21.820 --> 39:23.840]  healthier, and a whole lot more enjoyable.
[39:24.500 --> 39:25.660]  Fume is an innovative
[39:25.660 --> 39:27.720]  award winning flavored air device
[39:27.720 --> 39:29.800]  that does just that. Instead of
[39:29.800 --> 39:31.880]  vapor, fume uses flavored
[39:31.880 --> 39:33.640]  air. Instead of electronics,
[39:34.100 --> 39:35.500]  fume is completely natural.
[39:36.100 --> 39:37.960]  And instead of harmful chemicals,
[39:38.440 --> 39:39.660]  fume uses delicious
[39:39.660 --> 39:41.460]  flavors. You get it.
[39:41.800 --> 39:43.880]  Instead of bad, fume is good.
[39:44.160 --> 39:45.740]  It's a habit you're free to enjoy
[39:45.740 --> 39:47.700]  and makes replacing your bad habit
[39:47.700 --> 39:49.600]  easy. Your fume comes with an
[39:49.600 --> 39:51.940]  adjustable airflow dial and is designed
[39:51.940 --> 39:53.640]  with movable parts and magnets for
[39:53.640 --> 39:55.920]  fidgeting, giving your fingers a lot to do
[39:55.920 --> 39:57.740]  which is helpful for de-stressing
[39:57.740 --> 39:59.860]  and anxiety while breaking your habit.
[39:59.980 --> 40:01.920]  Now when I first saw fume, I didn't necessarily
[40:01.920 --> 40:03.900]  know what to expect, but I was immediately taken
[40:03.900 --> 40:05.580]  by how cool it looks.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.800]  You know, so many devices look absolutely
[40:07.800 --> 40:09.620]  ridiculous to use and are things you may
[40:09.620 --> 40:11.640]  be embarrassed about using publicly.
[40:11.880 --> 40:13.800]  Not the case at all with fume, it looks awesome
[40:13.800 --> 40:15.820]  and it's also just a very fun
[40:15.820 --> 40:17.920]  thing to play with. As somebody who enjoys
[40:17.920 --> 40:19.300]  like fidget toy type things,
[40:19.900 --> 40:22.020]  it has a lot of utilization
[40:22.020 --> 40:23.820]  in that way, like I said,
[40:23.820 --> 40:25.280]  that makes it a fun product.
[40:25.700 --> 40:27.840]  Plus, fume just released a
[40:27.840 --> 40:29.920]  magnetic stand for your fume
[40:29.920 --> 40:31.860]  so there's no more losing it around
[40:31.860 --> 40:33.860]  the house. It's built with fidgeting in mind
[40:33.860 --> 40:36.040]  so you can spin your fume around
[40:36.040 --> 40:37.920]  on it. Start the year
[40:37.920 --> 40:39.960]  off right with the good habit by going
[40:39.960 --> 40:41.880]  to tryfume.com slash face
[40:41.880 --> 40:43.860]  and getting the journey pack today.
[40:44.440 --> 40:45.920]  Fume is giving listeners of the
[40:45.920 --> 40:48.100]  show 10% off when they use my code
[40:48.100 --> 40:49.980]  FACE to help make
[40:49.980 --> 40:51.840]  starting the good habit that much
[40:51.840 --> 40:52.260]  easier.
[40:54.920 --> 40:55.520]  Wow.
[40:55.780 --> 40:57.740]  That sounds so much better than the
[40:57.740 --> 40:59.840]  movie I've watched. What did you
[40:59.840 --> 41:00.320]  watch?
[41:01.460 --> 41:03.440]  What the fuck is that?
[41:05.080 --> 41:05.980]  Slap Her
[41:05.980 --> 41:07.880]  She's French? I was just at
[41:07.880 --> 41:09.300]  Airbnb recently and the
[41:09.780 --> 41:11.760]  TV just had that as one of the movies on the
[41:11.760 --> 41:12.440]  home page.
[41:14.860 --> 41:15.760]  It's called
[41:15.760 --> 41:17.120]  Slap Her She's French.
[41:21.180 --> 41:22.180]  How was it?
[41:22.860 --> 41:24.220]  I didn't really watch it.
[41:24.300 --> 41:25.780]  I probably watched 5 minutes and then I went away
[41:25.780 --> 41:27.640]  and then I saw that Michael Bikin was in it
[41:27.640 --> 41:28.640]  and then I went to sleep.
[41:31.600 --> 41:32.400]  Good review.
[41:33.320 --> 41:34.500]  The thing that
[41:34.980 --> 41:36.720]  really amuses me about the woman with the
[41:36.720 --> 41:38.220]  red lipstick is the idea of her
[41:38.220 --> 41:40.340]  opening the box and just imagining
[41:40.340 --> 41:42.020]  all the different things that could be in the box.
[41:42.540 --> 41:44.240]  Like she opens it and my head immediately went
[41:44.240 --> 41:45.540]  there's like a pair of
[41:45.540 --> 41:46.020]  hands.
[41:46.720 --> 41:48.520]  You got Hulk hands?
[41:48.680 --> 41:50.000]  Your name is Bruce Banner
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.800]  and I'm going to meet you at Dave and Buster
[41:51.800 --> 41:52.720]  at 730.
[41:54.380 --> 41:55.940]  Let me give you
[41:55.940 --> 41:58.020]  a little bit more because it's such a good
[41:58.020 --> 41:59.560]  story. So then she's like
[41:59.560 --> 42:02.080]  I gotta start investigating Maggie's
[42:02.080 --> 42:03.960]  disappearance and she's real good
[42:03.960 --> 42:06.020]  friends with the detective in charge and she goes
[42:06.020 --> 42:07.940]  to him and she's like what do you think? And he's like
[42:07.940 --> 42:10.100]  she just left town. There's nothing. There's no signs
[42:10.100 --> 42:11.820]  of a struggle. Nothing. She's rich.
[42:11.920 --> 42:14.020]  She's got money and she's had a fight with her mom
[42:14.020 --> 42:16.140]  or something and she left town. There's nothing to it.
[42:16.180 --> 42:17.820]  And she goes okay. I don't know.
[42:17.880 --> 42:19.980]  She feels a little weird about the whole thing. So then
[42:19.980 --> 42:21.560]  she starts looking her up on social media
[42:21.560 --> 42:23.560]  and in every photo
[42:23.560 --> 42:25.020]  on social media
[42:26.660 --> 42:28.120]  Maggie is unhappy.
[42:29.020 --> 42:30.000]  She's graduating from
[42:30.000 --> 42:31.960]  college. She's frowning. She's out
[42:31.960 --> 42:33.680]  at a bar with friends. She's frowning.
[42:34.200 --> 42:35.260]  And Lucy realizes
[42:35.960 --> 42:37.920]  something is wrong in Maggie's life
[42:37.920 --> 42:39.560]  because she's too successful
[42:39.560 --> 42:41.760]  and too rich and too beautiful
[42:41.760 --> 42:43.660]  to be unhappy in every photo
[42:43.660 --> 42:45.840]  so she goes back to the cops and she
[42:45.840 --> 42:47.940]  says look deeper. I'm telling you
[42:47.940 --> 42:49.720]  there's something going on and so
[42:49.720 --> 42:51.840]  the cops do and they find
[42:51.840 --> 42:53.580]  something. She is missing.
[42:53.760 --> 42:54.700]  It was an abduction.
[42:56.920 --> 42:57.740]  That's where I'll
[42:57.740 --> 42:57.960]  stop.
[42:59.560 --> 43:01.760]  Well, I wasn't gonna watch it
[43:01.760 --> 43:03.940]  before and I'm certainly not gonna watch it now.
[43:04.300 --> 43:05.480]  I appreciate the continuation.
[43:06.100 --> 43:07.820]  Social media. Edge of my seat.
[43:09.080 --> 43:09.780]  Wait, you
[43:09.780 --> 43:11.480]  don't want to watch it? No.
[43:12.660 --> 43:13.420]  I know what happened.
[43:13.600 --> 43:15.960]  I think you're fucking crazy. I think the boyfriend
[43:15.960 --> 43:17.780]  killed her. I know what happened. The boyfriend is the
[43:17.780 --> 43:18.700]  killer. I
[43:19.700 --> 43:21.720]  gave you the first ten minutes. There's a lot of
[43:21.720 --> 43:23.340]  other characters that get introduced very quickly.
[43:23.500 --> 43:25.640]  I think...
[43:25.640 --> 43:28.200]  Or there might not be a killer. It might be a kidnapper.
[43:29.300 --> 43:29.640]  Oh.
[43:31.420 --> 43:31.780]  Interesting.
[43:32.200 --> 43:33.560]  It is interesting, goddammit.
[43:33.560 --> 43:35.180]  Okay, I'm back on.
[43:35.720 --> 43:37.460]  Probably watch that instead of any of those
[43:37.460 --> 43:38.720]  seven-hour goddamn
[43:39.460 --> 43:41.080]  Oscar movies. Jesus Christ.
[43:41.280 --> 43:43.420]  Who's got time for that? I'm on IMDb.
[43:43.500 --> 43:45.400]  The top review gives it a five out of ten with
[43:45.400 --> 43:47.540]  the headline, skip it.
[43:47.700 --> 43:48.560]  And says that
[43:49.160 --> 43:51.100]  it was predictable
[43:51.100 --> 43:53.340]  with flat acting and many continuity
[43:53.340 --> 43:55.640]  flaws by a weak Canadian cast.
[43:55.960 --> 43:57.400]  Oh, that's another thing, too.
[43:57.700 --> 43:59.000]  Most everybody in it's Canadian.
[43:59.520 --> 44:01.360]  So I feel like you might
[44:01.360 --> 44:03.640]  understand layers of it that we don't.
[44:04.020 --> 44:05.380]  It was filmed in Canada.
[44:05.380 --> 44:05.900]  Yeah.
[44:06.060 --> 44:09.360]  Takes place in Chicago, filmed in Canada.
[44:10.080 --> 44:11.340]  Vancouver is typically
[44:11.340 --> 44:13.400]  I feel like fake Chicago in Canada.
[44:14.240 --> 44:15.280]  Well, I have
[44:15.280 --> 44:17.680]  an Oscar movie review of sorts
[44:17.680 --> 44:18.800]  from my mom.
[44:19.240 --> 44:20.840]  I haven't told a mom story in a while.
[44:21.760 --> 44:22.060]  She
[44:22.960 --> 44:25.120]  went and saw Poor Things,
[44:25.320 --> 44:26.840]  which I think is Oscar nominated.
[44:27.260 --> 44:29.400]  I don't really know anything about it.
[44:30.740 --> 44:31.900]  She saw it
[44:31.900 --> 44:33.500]  and she didn't know
[44:33.500 --> 44:35.620]  anything about it outside of it had Oscar
[44:35.620 --> 44:35.920]  buzz.
[44:38.140 --> 44:39.020]  She said,
[44:39.100 --> 44:41.140]  I talked to her and she told me
[44:41.140 --> 44:43.180]  it was really well acted.
[44:43.560 --> 44:45.000]  There were things in it that
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.780]  I didn't necessarily like,
[44:47.920 --> 44:49.380]  but the performances
[44:49.380 --> 44:51.380]  were really good. And when I hear that, that
[44:51.380 --> 44:53.340]  typically means it's a weird sex
[44:53.340 --> 44:54.880]  thing is what I assumed.
[44:56.100 --> 44:57.380]  I don't know anything about the movie.
[44:57.840 --> 44:59.140]  But then that was our talk about it.
[44:59.180 --> 45:01.260]  And then two or three days later, I talked to her again.
[45:01.260 --> 45:02.860]  And she said,
[45:03.780 --> 45:04.900]  yeah, you know,
[45:05.160 --> 45:06.600]  can I tell you something?
[45:06.940 --> 45:09.360]  Can I tell you something? You can't tell anybody
[45:09.360 --> 45:10.000]  else this.
[45:10.880 --> 45:12.440]  And I said, of course, what's up?
[45:12.880 --> 45:14.340]  You're about to tell somebody else this.
[45:14.420 --> 45:15.860]  Yeah, well, it's cleared. I got it cleared.
[45:16.040 --> 45:18.140]  She said,
[45:18.180 --> 45:20.540]  you know that Poor Things movie I saw?
[45:21.060 --> 45:21.640]  I said, yeah.
[45:22.440 --> 45:24.960]  She said, Emma Stone has the weirdest
[45:24.960 --> 45:26.300]  nipples I've ever seen.
[45:26.660 --> 45:27.600]  And I worked
[45:28.220 --> 45:29.760]  I worked in a nursery
[45:29.760 --> 45:31.600]  in a hospital. I've seen a lot of nipples.
[45:31.740 --> 45:33.280]  What's her exact wording?
[45:34.200 --> 45:35.760]  What's wrong with it? I haven't seen the movie.
[45:35.940 --> 45:37.580]  I don't know. I haven't seen it either.
[45:37.860 --> 45:39.620]  But that is my mom's review of Poor
[45:39.620 --> 45:41.660]  Things. Very well acted. Emma Stone
[45:41.660 --> 45:43.560]  has the weirdest nipples she's ever seen.
[45:43.840 --> 45:45.000]  Emma Stone.
[45:45.000 --> 45:46.900]  She's ever seen? That can't be right.
[45:46.900 --> 45:49.060]  She's seen a lot of nipples.
[45:49.760 --> 45:50.620]  She worked in a nursery.
[45:51.300 --> 45:53.660]  She is qualified. If there's anyone who is qualified
[45:53.660 --> 45:55.660]  to make that statement, it's her.
[45:55.660 --> 45:57.980]  And no one else here has seen this movie?
[45:59.640 --> 46:01.840]  I don't know anything about it outside of that.
[46:02.080 --> 46:03.820]  No, it's too Eastern European
[46:03.820 --> 46:05.860]  weird. It looks so like
[46:06.400 --> 46:08.080]  Slav. I've heard it's good
[46:08.080 --> 46:10.040]  but anytime I saw the trailer
[46:10.040 --> 46:12.020]  I just really thought that I didn't want to watch it.
[46:13.020 --> 46:13.820]  Something about
[46:13.820 --> 46:15.980]  her eyebrows in the trailer creeps me
[46:15.980 --> 46:17.620]  out and so I won't watch it because of that.
[46:20.240 --> 46:21.600]  I don't know what it is.
[46:22.040 --> 46:23.280]  It's just every time I see it I go...
[46:23.740 --> 46:25.340]  Are there any other movies that you
[46:25.340 --> 46:27.400]  haven't seen because of somebody's eyebrows?
[46:27.580 --> 46:29.600]  No, this is a first for me. That's why it stands out.
[46:30.440 --> 46:32.900]  The internet does not have those nipples.
[46:34.200 --> 46:35.600]  They're not anywhere on the internet.
[46:36.520 --> 46:37.320]  They're weird.
[46:37.580 --> 46:38.800]  Let me try to Bing it.
[46:39.320 --> 46:40.360]  Try to hide it.
[46:43.680 --> 46:44.120]  Siri.
[46:44.700 --> 46:46.940]  Binging nipples now that we've got no jobs.
[46:47.680 --> 46:48.560]  Binging nipples.
[46:51.140 --> 46:51.580]  Images.
[46:52.200 --> 46:54.280]  I haven't seen Bing in a long time. This is wild.
[46:54.860 --> 46:56.560]  Nah, it's just a lot of pictures of her
[46:56.560 --> 46:59.140]  looking like she's in Minority Report
[46:59.140 --> 47:00.480]  with shit connected to her head.
[47:00.940 --> 47:01.980]  What about Ask Jeeves?
[47:04.500 --> 47:05.980]  I don't think so.
[47:06.500 --> 47:08.280]  Ask Jeeves. I bet it goes to
[47:08.800 --> 47:09.860]  answer.com or something.
[47:12.600 --> 47:14.040]  Oh, I spelled it wrong.
[47:16.160 --> 47:16.940]  It's been a while
[47:16.940 --> 47:17.660]  since you've used it.
[47:17.860 --> 47:18.840]  It's probably alright.
[47:19.940 --> 47:21.240]  It's still around. Let's see.
[47:21.740 --> 47:23.440]  Wow! That's surprising.
[47:23.880 --> 47:25.920]  That was my browser of choice as a child.
[47:26.560 --> 47:27.460]  Not that there were a lot to pick from.
[47:27.460 --> 47:28.360]  You're a Jeeves guy?
[47:28.680 --> 47:29.880]  I was a big Jeeves guy.
[47:30.460 --> 47:33.820]  I thought there was really a Jeeves on the other side.
[47:35.800 --> 47:37.540]  I was a Lycos kid.
[47:37.960 --> 47:39.580]  Just have the dog go fetch it.
[47:40.900 --> 47:41.740]  It's still around.
[47:41.740 --> 47:43.240]  Lycos is still around. That's pretty cool.
[47:43.480 --> 47:45.900]  How do I spell that? L-Y-C-O-S.
[47:46.840 --> 47:48.620]  I was a web crawler guy.
[47:49.940 --> 47:51.600]  Because I had a cute little spider.
[47:52.220 --> 47:53.540]  All these names are...
[47:54.120 --> 47:55.180]  Lycos, not so much.
[47:55.520 --> 47:57.220]  Ask Jeeves and web crawler?
[47:57.760 --> 47:59.820]  So much more fun than just Google Chrome.
[48:00.580 --> 48:02.000]  Yesterday, I think we were trying to find out
[48:02.580 --> 48:03.700]  who was older.
[48:04.080 --> 48:05.820]  Gracie or my email address.
[48:08.680 --> 48:10.660]  Was there ever a determination on that?
[48:13.100 --> 48:13.500]  Uh...
[48:13.500 --> 48:14.420]  When did you make your email?
[48:15.220 --> 48:15.620]  2004.
[48:16.580 --> 48:17.760]  Okay, I'm older than your email.
[48:18.220 --> 48:20.580]  My Hotmail is from 2000 though.
[48:20.720 --> 48:21.120]  Oh!
[48:25.080 --> 48:25.820]  That's crazy.
[48:26.300 --> 48:27.720]  I love that you still have a Hotmail, man.
[48:27.780 --> 48:29.400]  I use it for Xbox Live.
[48:29.620 --> 48:30.440]  So do I!
[48:31.440 --> 48:32.720]  I thought, Gavin,
[48:33.020 --> 48:35.140]  I thought you were about to say for business.
[48:35.480 --> 48:36.460]  And I was going to go...
[48:37.080 --> 48:39.040]  You use your Hotmail for Xbox Live?
[48:39.040 --> 48:41.420]  I use a live.com email address.
[48:41.480 --> 48:42.640]  I don't even think they have anymore.
[48:44.040 --> 48:45.260]  Wasn't that after Hotmail?
[48:45.720 --> 48:46.280]  It was.
[48:48.160 --> 48:49.660]  But they don't have Hotmail anymore.
[48:50.780 --> 48:51.260]  Well...
[48:51.260 --> 48:52.660]  No, they got rid of Messenger.
[48:52.920 --> 48:53.720]  That's what I'm thinking of.
[48:54.080 --> 48:54.540]  MSN?
[48:54.880 --> 48:56.560]  Yeah, whatever that was.
[48:58.280 --> 49:01.540]  I like that Eric said that thinking nobody else here uses it.
[49:01.660 --> 49:02.720]  And Nick and I both like,
[49:02.800 --> 49:03.620]  Yeah, me too!
[49:05.260 --> 49:07.020]  Eric, how do you not use your Hotmail?
[49:08.640 --> 49:10.560]  Why would I have a Hotmail account?
[49:10.720 --> 49:11.400]  You never had one?
[49:11.780 --> 49:12.580]  No, I did.
[49:12.800 --> 49:16.300]  In the late 90s or early 2000s.
[49:16.360 --> 49:17.400]  But I don't have it anymore.
[49:17.880 --> 49:19.960]  You don't like your emails to be piping hot
[49:19.960 --> 49:20.700]  when they come in?
[49:21.500 --> 49:23.300]  No, I'm more of a Coldmail man.
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.020]  Oh, you're a Coldmail guy?
[49:25.080 --> 49:26.180]  Yeah, I like Coldmail, yeah.
[49:27.280 --> 49:29.720]  Oh, I like the urgency of a Hotmail.
[49:30.580 --> 49:32.500]  Hey, just circling back,
[49:32.580 --> 49:33.880]  Geoff, did you ever find those nipples or what?
[49:34.360 --> 49:35.540]  Nah, I never did.
[49:35.540 --> 49:36.980]  I gave up looking, though.
[49:37.580 --> 49:39.200]  Anybody else, feel free to Google if you want.
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.720]  I've already moved on, mentally.
[49:43.900 --> 49:44.680]  How weird could they be?
[49:45.420 --> 49:46.920]  Yeah, Eric, let us know if you find them.
[49:47.220 --> 49:47.960]  Yeah, keep going, Eric.
[49:48.640 --> 49:50.060]  Me and Gracie are on the prowl.
[49:50.220 --> 49:50.920]  We're searching.
[49:53.520 --> 49:54.520]  Yeah, don't worry, guys.
[49:54.540 --> 49:55.940]  I'm searching for the nipples hard.
[49:57.800 --> 49:58.500]  I don't...
[49:58.500 --> 50:00.900]  That was an unfortunate additional
[50:00.900 --> 50:02.500]  I think you meant with urgency,
[50:02.740 --> 50:03.640]  but the use of hard
[50:03.640 --> 50:05.280]  is regrettable.
[50:06.380 --> 50:08.260]  That's a very narrow search
[50:08.260 --> 50:09.800]  on something that already
[50:09.800 --> 50:11.500]  appears to be hard to find.
[50:13.360 --> 50:14.300]  That's not what I meant.
[50:14.320 --> 50:16.000]  So we've heard your mom's views
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.520]  on butt plugs and
[50:17.520 --> 50:18.600]  nipples.
[50:19.220 --> 50:21.280]  I wonder what's next.
[50:22.020 --> 50:22.440]  Yeah.
[50:23.760 --> 50:26.020]  I don't know. She has...
[50:27.900 --> 50:28.920]  There's a woman
[50:29.580 --> 50:31.480]  in the building my mom lives in
[50:31.480 --> 50:33.400]  that she's become friends with
[50:33.400 --> 50:35.180]  but she doesn't know my mom's name.
[50:35.580 --> 50:37.400]  Like, they met once and she
[50:37.400 --> 50:39.480]  misremembered her as a different name.
[50:39.940 --> 50:41.620]  I'll just use Robin as the fake name.
[50:41.660 --> 50:43.020]  I don't remember what it is. She's like,
[50:43.100 --> 50:45.400]  Hey, Robin! And my mom was just like, Hey, how's it going?
[50:45.600 --> 50:47.100]  And now they've become friends
[50:47.100 --> 50:48.520]  but she's still Robin
[50:48.520 --> 50:50.300]  and she doesn't know how to
[50:51.220 --> 50:53.360]  correct that. So that is outside
[50:53.360 --> 50:54.460]  of Emma Stearns' vision.
[50:54.860 --> 50:57.620]  If I were your mom, I would just change
[50:57.620 --> 50:58.200]  my name.
[50:59.640 --> 50:59.960]  Dude.
[51:00.260 --> 51:02.360]  Are you ready? I found pictures. We're gonna have to
[51:02.860 --> 51:04.240]  delete these. Be careful posting
[51:04.240 --> 51:06.500]  them in here though. You could get fired.
[51:09.060 --> 51:10.900]  Yeah, Gracie, look away.
[51:11.940 --> 51:13.100]  What? Why can't what?
[51:13.800 --> 51:16.580]  Why does Gracie have to look away? Everybody's a grown-up.
[51:17.460 --> 51:18.180]  If anything, we should
[51:18.180 --> 51:20.260]  have to look away and Gracie would be the only one that could look at him.
[51:20.720 --> 51:22.300]  Oh, that's fair. Alright, why don't we do that?
[51:22.480 --> 51:24.440]  We'll all look away and Gracie can tell us
[51:24.440 --> 51:25.840]  what she thinks of these nips.
[51:26.560 --> 51:28.400]  Okay, Gracie, tell us what they look like.
[51:28.480 --> 51:29.980]  We don't get to see. 3, 2, 1. My eyes are closed.
[51:30.500 --> 51:30.720]  Oh.
[51:33.340 --> 51:34.100]  I mean...
[51:34.100 --> 51:35.580]  Wait. What's that?
[51:36.580 --> 51:38.020]  Can they be deleted?
[51:38.580 --> 51:40.240]  Can we open our eyes yet?
[51:40.340 --> 51:41.240]  Is anyone looking?
[51:41.460 --> 51:42.560]  Am I really the only one looking?
[51:46.280 --> 51:48.180]  The first... so there's two photos.
[51:48.340 --> 51:49.680]  One is like a collage
[51:49.680 --> 51:51.740]  and then there's a single photo.
[51:51.880 --> 51:53.540]  The single photo is a little bit more alarming
[51:53.540 --> 51:54.960]  than the collage.
[51:55.220 --> 51:56.460]  What alarms you about it?
[51:57.660 --> 51:59.520]  I feel mean but like
[51:59.520 --> 52:01.540]  it's a little puffy.
[52:03.660 --> 52:05.240]  But I feel really mean.
[52:05.300 --> 52:07.860]  This is a weird conversation. Can we delete the picture
[52:07.860 --> 52:08.920]  so I can open my eyes?
[52:09.180 --> 52:10.460]  This was your idea.
[52:11.260 --> 52:12.160]  Y'all just gotta look.
[52:13.400 --> 52:14.820]  Now I don't wanna look.
[52:15.160 --> 52:17.500]  I thought they were gonna be like robot nipples or something.
[52:17.780 --> 52:20.060]  No, I don't think they're that weird.
[52:20.060 --> 52:21.860]  I thought they were gonna be like metal cones.
[52:21.860 --> 52:24.360]  Like for Andrew's mom to remember them
[52:24.360 --> 52:25.480]  I'm not seeing it.
[52:25.480 --> 52:27.940]  I don't know what Andrew's mom saw.
[52:28.240 --> 52:30.020]  Maybe there's a different part of the movie.
[52:30.340 --> 52:32.180]  These are nothing one way or the other.
[52:32.360 --> 52:33.300]  Alright, I'm opening my eyes.
[52:33.560 --> 52:34.680]  Okay, have a look.
[52:35.200 --> 52:36.240]  They're just boobs.
[52:39.040 --> 52:40.000]  There's nothing...
[52:40.000 --> 52:40.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[52:41.200 --> 52:43.840]  I think Gracie did a great job describing
[52:43.840 --> 52:45.960]  it was very nice and just trying to
[52:45.960 --> 52:47.360]  find something that was gonna be
[52:47.360 --> 52:50.240]  okay, what could it have been that his mom
[52:50.240 --> 52:51.080]  thought was weird?
[52:51.620 --> 52:52.420]  They're standard.
[52:53.080 --> 52:55.700]  I feel like if I...
[52:56.160 --> 52:57.920]  It's so hard to phrase anything about this.
[52:58.260 --> 52:59.800]  I feel like I wouldn't put an eyelid to this.
[53:00.320 --> 53:01.880]  No, I know what you mean.
[53:02.160 --> 53:02.460]  Absolutely.
[53:03.600 --> 53:05.620]  Can I delete this now?
[53:05.920 --> 53:06.540]  Wish you would.
[53:08.580 --> 53:09.980]  Do you ever do those
[53:09.980 --> 53:12.080]  things where they're like rubber and you'd push
[53:12.080 --> 53:14.340]  them so they'd go inside and then they'd bounce?
[53:14.980 --> 53:16.720]  Like you'd push them into themselves?
[53:17.640 --> 53:18.620]  That's what it looked like.
[53:18.620 --> 53:19.720]  Ping up off the table?
[53:20.220 --> 53:20.280]  Yeah.
[53:23.520 --> 53:24.600]  They look kinda like
[53:24.600 --> 53:25.780]  a diaphragm.
[53:26.140 --> 53:28.580]  Do you think if you turn one of those little
[53:28.580 --> 53:30.660]  rubber things inside out and then squat it over it
[53:30.660 --> 53:32.320]  could you catch it in your ass?
[53:32.500 --> 53:33.480]  Cheeks? Between them?
[53:34.260 --> 53:34.680]  No.
[53:36.680 --> 53:37.520]  Well, actually...
[53:37.520 --> 53:39.640]  Can I manipulate my ass cheeks with my hands?
[53:40.540 --> 53:40.740]  Yeah.
[53:42.880 --> 53:44.540]  Now that would be a good video.
[53:45.160 --> 53:45.780]  Would it?
[53:46.540 --> 53:47.020]  Yes.
[53:53.540 --> 53:55.300]  Because we can put all the, you know,
[53:55.840 --> 53:57.020]  all the jetties can still be
[53:57.720 --> 53:58.200]  contained.
[54:00.400 --> 54:01.480]  I don't know.
[54:01.660 --> 54:03.300]  I think it depends on
[54:03.300 --> 54:05.120]  is there like a limit?
[54:05.260 --> 54:07.900]  Imagine a side by side in like a hospital gown
[54:07.900 --> 54:09.460]  so you wouldn't see anything gruesome.
[54:09.920 --> 54:11.220]  I think that'd be an interesting video.
[54:13.140 --> 54:13.900]  You'll know.
[54:13.900 --> 54:15.140]  Because it's just like
[54:15.140 --> 54:17.420]  a person squatting over the ground
[54:17.420 --> 54:19.900]  and then the bottom of the
[54:21.440 --> 54:22.020]  hospital gown
[54:22.020 --> 54:23.040]  is the only thing you can see.
[54:23.480 --> 54:25.360]  And then when you hit the thing and it pops up into the air
[54:25.360 --> 54:26.820]  it either comes back down or it doesn't.
[54:27.340 --> 54:28.220]  Or it's just gone.
[54:28.740 --> 54:30.240]  If it disappears, you did it.
[54:31.380 --> 54:33.840]  It could almost be like a magic trick
[54:33.840 --> 54:35.360]  where David Blaine has made
[54:35.360 --> 54:36.960]  the smallest incision
[54:36.960 --> 54:39.900]  in his pants and has timed it perfectly
[54:39.900 --> 54:40.960]  and knows the angle
[54:40.960 --> 54:42.260]  to catch it
[54:42.260 --> 54:43.740]  like it has disappeared.
[54:44.380 --> 54:46.800]  I think I could catch it in 20 goes.
[54:47.040 --> 54:48.940]  Oh, I could catch it in 15.
[54:49.620 --> 54:50.460]  Ooh, Eric?
[54:50.760 --> 54:51.760]  No thank you.
[54:52.440 --> 54:54.940]  Have you seen the clips of that
[54:54.940 --> 54:56.440]  show where they have to try to
[54:56.890 --> 54:58.680]  figure out what the song is by notes
[54:58.680 --> 55:01.060]  and they just go back and forth? This is the worst version
[55:01.060 --> 55:02.800]  of that. I think I could catch it
[55:02.800 --> 55:05.100]  in 7. I think I could do it in 6.
[55:05.980 --> 55:06.700]  Let's see it.
[55:06.700 --> 55:08.380]  Let's see it happen. I don't believe you.
[55:08.380 --> 55:09.960]  I don't think I could do it.
[55:10.160 --> 55:11.760]  And this is coming from someone who has
[55:12.760 --> 55:14.280]  gripped a shampoo bottle.
[55:14.780 --> 55:16.280]  I just don't think I have the
[55:16.280 --> 55:18.020]  timing. I think I'd struggle.
[55:18.280 --> 55:19.460]  You always tell it like you
[55:20.300 --> 55:22.420]  had the shampoo bottle at any point.
[55:22.740 --> 55:24.880]  If you can... Oh, I definitely did.
[55:25.840 --> 55:26.660]  Come on.
[55:27.120 --> 55:27.960]  No, I definitely did.
[55:28.180 --> 55:29.620]  You didn't do anything with it.
[55:30.080 --> 55:31.900]  No, no, no. I was
[55:31.900 --> 55:33.720]  stabilized. It was in there.
[55:34.320 --> 55:36.380]  I think the only hard part about it is
[55:36.380 --> 55:38.040]  the aim, right?
[55:38.560 --> 55:40.300]  Because if it doesn't go straight up into your
[55:40.300 --> 55:42.480]  asshole, it could bounce off your cheeks or something
[55:42.480 --> 55:44.360]  and it's going to be hard for you to correct because you
[55:44.360 --> 55:46.400]  can't really see it. You might want to squat
[55:46.400 --> 55:48.320]  pretty deep. Yeah, but I really do
[55:48.320 --> 55:49.920]  think if I feel it hit my
[55:49.920 --> 55:51.620]  like my, you know,
[55:52.320 --> 55:53.920]  the hole, I feel like I could
[55:54.540 --> 55:55.660]  grab it pretty fast.
[55:56.180 --> 55:58.000]  I feel like you'd have to have an eye on it because
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.320]  you wouldn't be able to react based on feel.
[56:00.600 --> 56:02.300]  You wouldn't be able to clench shut. You would have to
[56:02.300 --> 56:04.480]  see it go and then preemptively clench.
[56:04.480 --> 56:06.400]  Maybe you could see in a mirror or something.
[56:07.720 --> 56:08.520]  Hmm. Hmm.
[56:09.680 --> 56:10.240]  I don't know.
[56:10.460 --> 56:12.460]  That'd make it harder to film. But I agree with you.
[56:12.580 --> 56:14.560]  Or you'd have to like pop it two or three
[56:14.560 --> 56:16.700]  times, feel how long it takes to hit your asshole
[56:16.700 --> 56:18.480]  and then be like, okay, and then just
[56:18.480 --> 56:20.160]  mentally prepare for that amount of time.
[56:22.240 --> 56:22.720]  What are
[56:22.720 --> 56:24.240]  those things even? Are they just poppers?
[56:24.440 --> 56:26.280]  Is that what they're called? What are they?
[56:28.360 --> 56:28.960]  I don't know.
[56:29.080 --> 56:29.260]  Poppers.
[56:30.480 --> 56:32.200]  Plastic. I don't know. Launcher.
[56:32.200 --> 56:34.240]  I just, I don't know if I came up
[56:34.240 --> 56:36.280]  with the term poppers. Stick one on the
[56:36.280 --> 56:38.460]  end of a grown tube. You've got a little tiny little plunger.
[56:42.420 --> 56:44.080]  We could glue one to the
[56:44.080 --> 56:46.400]  to the key chain of the grown tube
[56:46.400 --> 56:47.680]  and you could have a
[56:48.900 --> 56:49.300]  a
[56:50.180 --> 56:51.320]  plunge tube on the go.
[56:53.080 --> 56:54.480]  And they're called party poppers.
[56:54.720 --> 56:55.520]  Party poppers.
[56:56.960 --> 56:58.020]  Party poppers are the
[56:58.020 --> 56:59.720]  frickin, pull the string.
[56:59.720 --> 57:01.600]  Oh, these are glitter poppers. I guess
[57:01.600 --> 57:03.920]  there's all sorts of variations, but poppers
[57:03.920 --> 57:04.420]  is the
[57:05.420 --> 57:07.860]  key. I had an experience
[57:07.860 --> 57:09.700]  that happened recently, and
[57:09.700 --> 57:11.860]  I realized, I process things
[57:11.860 --> 57:13.700]  I think in maybe a unique way, but I'm curious
[57:13.700 --> 57:14.700]  if anyone else does this.
[57:18.220 --> 57:19.520]  So I was cleaning,
[57:19.680 --> 57:21.640]  I cleaned my bathroom recently, and I have
[57:21.640 --> 57:23.640]  this little wooden
[57:23.640 --> 57:25.820]  like trash type thing.
[57:26.220 --> 57:27.680]  You know, if you put garbage or whatever into
[57:27.680 --> 57:29.680]  but I don't use it at all, it's just there.
[57:30.480 --> 57:31.900]  And so I was moving that around.
[57:32.460 --> 57:33.700]  And then I had a shower
[57:34.680 --> 57:35.120]  and
[57:36.440 --> 57:37.860]  I don't like having
[57:37.860 --> 57:39.400]  the light on in the bathroom, so
[57:39.400 --> 57:41.720]  I do everything in the dark in the bathroom for the most part.
[57:42.540 --> 57:43.680]  And when I was
[57:43.680 --> 57:45.880]  stepping out of the shower, I stepped
[57:45.880 --> 57:47.780]  in the wooden box, but
[57:47.780 --> 57:49.500]  thankfully that wasn't my first step.
[57:49.540 --> 57:51.660]  I had one step out, normal floor.
[57:51.960 --> 57:53.700]  Second step, right into
[57:53.700 --> 57:55.560]  the metal, or the wooden container.
[57:56.120 --> 57:57.280]  Wait, why was it
[57:57.280 --> 57:59.120]  out in the middle of the floor?
[57:59.740 --> 58:01.660]  Because I was cleaning around the
[58:01.660 --> 58:03.240]  toilet where it typically is.
[58:03.280 --> 58:05.580]  I moved it up, and then I
[58:05.580 --> 58:07.440]  had a shower, and I forgot
[58:07.440 --> 58:09.820]  I had moved it. And thankfully
[58:09.820 --> 58:11.600]  I went left foot, normal,
[58:11.840 --> 58:13.780]  right foot, right into my wooden container.
[58:15.120 --> 58:17.020]  What would you say is your stronger foot?
[58:17.800 --> 58:18.800]  I would...
[58:20.880 --> 58:21.380]  Probably...
[58:21.380 --> 58:23.440]  Oh, that's tough. Left foot, I guess?
[58:23.440 --> 58:25.460]  I think I'd go left.
[58:25.680 --> 58:26.700]  Do you kick with your left?
[58:27.180 --> 58:29.280]  Yeah. Which leg did you cock back
[58:29.280 --> 58:30.180]  to kick the child?
[58:31.980 --> 58:33.460]  Yeah, if you were to kick a child
[58:33.460 --> 58:35.400]  in the chest right now, would you kick with your left
[58:35.400 --> 58:37.460]  foot or your right foot? Clearly you wouldn't do that.
[58:37.860 --> 58:39.480]  But if you did...
[58:39.480 --> 58:41.580]  I think I would do my right, but that's
[58:41.580 --> 58:43.400]  because I would feel that I'd have a
[58:43.400 --> 58:45.500]  better, stronger base with my left
[58:45.500 --> 58:46.400]  foot on the ground.
[58:47.080 --> 58:49.160]  I think it's your left foot on the
[58:49.160 --> 58:49.820]  skateboard.
[58:52.120 --> 58:52.560]  Yeah.
[58:53.800 --> 58:54.640]  For most people.
[58:56.420 --> 58:57.940]  No, I mean on the picture of the skateboard
[58:57.940 --> 58:59.720]  of the Vancouver child kicker, it says left.
[58:59.960 --> 59:00.860]  Oh, I see.
[59:01.720 --> 59:03.440]  I'm flashing back to my childhood when I
[59:03.440 --> 59:05.240]  rode a skateboard once and I do believe
[59:05.240 --> 59:06.420]  I went left.
[59:08.580 --> 59:09.460]  But anyway,
[59:10.040 --> 59:11.320]  I stepped in the bin
[59:11.320 --> 59:13.500]  and if I would have been foot
[59:13.500 --> 59:14.560]  first in the bin,
[59:15.040 --> 59:16.380]  that would have been so bad.
[59:16.800 --> 59:18.460]  I don't know if I'd go through the wall,
[59:18.460 --> 59:20.360]  I don't know if I'd break something,
[59:20.680 --> 59:22.500]  but I would have went down
[59:22.500 --> 59:24.620]  hard. And whenever
[59:24.620 --> 59:26.400]  anything like that happens
[59:26.400 --> 59:28.600]  and I avoid what I view as a potential
[59:28.600 --> 59:30.600]  disaster, I think about
[59:30.600 --> 59:32.640]  the idea that there
[59:32.640 --> 59:34.460]  are endless multiverses
[59:35.240 --> 59:36.840]  and I think from my understanding
[59:36.840 --> 59:38.280]  of like, there's a version
[59:38.760 --> 59:40.800]  of you, like the idea being the version
[59:40.800 --> 59:42.460]  of you in every scenario
[59:42.460 --> 59:44.360]  that plays out, and I
[59:44.360 --> 59:46.800]  instantly go, wow, there's a version of me
[59:46.800 --> 59:48.440]  that just got really fucked up.
[59:48.680 --> 59:50.720]  Oh, that sucks. That sucks
[59:50.720 --> 59:52.780]  for that me. And I
[59:52.780 --> 59:54.740]  don't know if that's weird or not. I just process for the
[59:54.740 --> 59:56.860]  first time of like, I've never talked about that.
[59:57.300 --> 59:58.560]  I do that all the time.
[59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.600]  Yeah. I think all the time I'm like,
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.680]  oh man, somewhere in the universe a Geoff
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.560]  just died. Yeah, like he
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.800]  fucking, like that car didn't stop and that Geoff
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.100]  did. Yes!
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.780]  I find it quite an
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.700]  icky feeling, just to be like, whoa,
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.940]  that could have been life changing.
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:14.600]  Yeah.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.060]  I have that to maybe
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.060]  an extremist extent where sometimes
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.060]  I'll be laying down to like, have
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.080]  a nap or whatever, and I think every
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.060]  second I just died in some timeline.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:28.160]  Do you wanna hear my crazy
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.800]  theory on death? Yeah.
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:31.480]  Oh, I'd love to. I guess.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:34.140]  I think everyone
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.520]  dies of old age
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.580]  in their own universe.
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:40.880]  Wait.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.300]  So,
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.200]  like, JFK was not
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.260]  that JFK was not part of our
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:48.400]  universe? Yeah, so when people
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.480]  die, they die in our universe.
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.240]  And then they just switch
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.880]  to a different one where they didn't die.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.280]  And they just live on. Everyone keeps living. Everyone gets
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.200]  really lucky all the time.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.320]  Do you think you know it? Do you think you're
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.040]  like, oh, that was weird.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.980]  Did I just have a bad dream? Anyway.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.240]  Or do you think like, well,
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.740]  I could have just choked on that hot dog.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.280]  And then in the other universe
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.180]  you did and died, and then you just
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.060]  warp into a universe where you didn't choke,
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.800]  essentially? I mean, I can
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.160]  count a bunch of times where I
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.040]  should have been dead.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.400]  And it's just so, it's like, how am I alive?
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.100]  Yeah. And I just figured, like,
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.160]  I must just have pivoted to
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.300]  the other universe. You know, it's so funny you say
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:30.440]  that, because we have that conversation
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.500]  about you a lot.
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.780]  Like, how did he make it this far?
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.280]  I'm just
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.400]  like dragging you all through my universe
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:38.880]  with me.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:44.300]  Well, that's comforting to know that
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.300]  if I die here early, I just have
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.600]  warped to another universe.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.320]  To a ripe old age. Unless I do something
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.320]  too stupid there, then I die and just warp to
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.340]  another one. If that's true, how
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.820]  many universes do you think you're on?
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.380]  I'm probably on my
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.000]  fifth universe. Okay.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.000]  Oh, that's low.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.000]  Isn't that low?
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.500]  I mean, I'm talking about events
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.460]  where I likely would
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:10.320]  have died. I see.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.400]  Okay, so we're not talking about
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.400]  the infinite possibility of everything
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.420]  that could happen to you. It is the
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:17.980]  things that have happened.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.020]  Yeah, and then you look back and you think,
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.280]  I just somehow
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.280]  escaped death.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:25.900]  Okay.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.020]  That's interesting.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.860]  I have to think about how many...
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:31.640]  Too many to count.
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.240]  Eric said, like,
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.900]  if you were in Key West
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:36.580]  in a shower.
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.740]  Yeah, that was a tragic version
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.600]  of Eric that
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.060]  to a bunch of other us,
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.000]  he went down in the shower and he never
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.540]  came back up. There's a universe
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.840]  where we all truly
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.860]  believe in the curse of the silver.
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:01.960]  There's a universe where you're telling people, no, my friend
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.240]  died. I swear to God, like, he did it.
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:06.340]  He was foolhardy. He died.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.920]  We were on a fucking, like,
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.760]  it was only a wedding weekend, and
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.960]  18 hours later, a fucking dead
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.780]  was dead by water.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.960]  He shot the shampoo in his
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.020]  own eye and drowned.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.240]  Can I... How does...
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.620]  How would this work in the scenario
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:25.460]  in which you all created
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.180]  of either strangling me to death
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:30.380]  or shooting me? Am I just...
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.340]  Am I doomed in every universe
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:33.560]  in that world?
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.560]  If it's happening every month? You never came close
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.380]  to us choking you to death.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.320]  It was hypothetical. It was all hypothetical.
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.500]  But I'm saying in the world in which
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.420]  that is... The hypothetical, I'm
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.940]  saying, if that was a reality,
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.520]  the point of the hypothetical is to treat
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.420]  it as though this is a thing you need to encounter.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.480]  Based on your theory,
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:54.420]  I would be hopping from
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.480]  just the same death into the
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.360]  same death over and over again.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.820]  That would be my fate.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.120]  I would reset, and then I would
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.420]  come back, and then it would happen again.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:07.940]  Then I would reset.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.440]  But, hypothetically, you're totally fine
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.580]  with it, and it's not a big deal.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.560]  Because I don't remember it like...
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.720]  I guess it would be, whoa,
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.140]  Geoff almost just shot me, or whatever,
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.380]  strangled me to death.
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.860]  Yeah, no, I don't
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.260]  think I like Gavin's theory
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.140]  in that hypothetical.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.120]  Why do I feel like I
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.160]  died yesterday
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.520]  every day when I wake up?
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.300]  You guys ever
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.300]  pick up any magazines
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:39.820]  lately?
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.380]  I just actually bought a magazine
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.060]  subscription, like, last week.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.240]  But I don't... To, like, paper that
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.420]  comes to your door? Yes!
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.640]  Paper that comes to my door. I have.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.900]  I've missed that experience. What is yours?
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.100]  I subscribe to Architectural
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.100]  Digest, and I tried to cancel that subscription
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.920]  yesterday, because it's stupid money I don't need to spend.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.900]  And they make it impossible. But that's not
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.020]  the point of this. The point of this is, I was at the
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.920]  grocery store the other day, and I picked up
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.940]  a magazine that I thought about buying, because it had
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.900]  like a... It was one of those, like, 30...
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.960]  Like, Better Homes and Gardens. Like, 30
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.040]  summer recipes that... in under
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.020]  30 minutes, or something. And I'm always, like, looking to
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:16.880]  cook quick and easy for Emily and Millie,
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:18.180]  because I'm the one that's at home all the time.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.000]  And I went to buy it.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.680]  Let me show you.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.140]  And then I didn't buy it.
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:26.120]  I wish I'd have prepared better for this.
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:27.920]  I gotta find these images now.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.100]  I'll just say it. How much do you think a fucking
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:31.680]  magazine at H-E-B costs?
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.740]  I bet it's absurd. $15.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.240]  Yeah, I was gonna say, like, $12.99
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:36.700]  or something.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.520]  The cheapest one I found
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.960]  was, like, $13.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:44.040]  The most expensive magazine I picked up
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.020]  was $17.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.840]  What was the $17 one?
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.020]  I'll try to find it.
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.120]  I took photos of it, because I was just horrified.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.940]  But every magazine was at least
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:56.220]  $12. And it was stuff like
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.040]  Southern Livin',
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.880]  Better Homes and Gardens, like whatever impulse
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.060]  magazine would be
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:03.240]  at a grocery store.
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.900]  Emily looked, because I was telling her
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.940]  about it, and she thought it was so crazy. She looked. You can buy
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.880]  a yearly subscription to each
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.380]  of those magazines I saw
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.860]  for cheaper than the one magazine you would buy
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:14.620]  at the grocery store.
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:16.820]  It's insane.
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.080]  That's what I'm wondering, too. How does it work?
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.360]  They're clearly priced at that point
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:23.120]  because it works for them.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.440]  I just don't understand.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.720]  So do you think that's what all
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.500]  the people on magazine stands do?
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.460]  They just buy
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:33.440]  the subscription and then sell them individually
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.820]  for the price of their subscription?
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:37.720]  Yes.
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:39.680]  No! No, I don't!
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.220]  I don't think that's how it works.
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.200]  Yeah, yeah, I think they subscribe to, like,
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.960]  ten of the same magazine
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.060]  just to make sure they're flush.
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:48.940]  He's got eight subscriptions to, like,
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:49.940]  Carp Monthly.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.700]  I think you might be onto something there.
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.220]  I was thinking
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.100]  about how I would have equated that as, like,
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.640]  a teenager with you saying $70
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.120]  my brain went. That's almost a DVD
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.260]  or one
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:04.340]  video game.
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:07.500]  That was, like, my main $20 DVD
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.040]  $60 video game.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:10.440]  That's how I think about shit, too.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.480]  I've got to say,
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.680]  my watch for Nick and the Mask
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:15.840]  is coming to its end soon.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.780]  Oh, man. So is the company.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:18.940]  So is the company.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:20.820]  Jeez.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.740]  Oh, that hurts.
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.220]  I will say that
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:28.140]  when I stepped in that wooden box on Sunday,
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.520]  I was like, I'm a lucky guy. And those feelings shifted
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.500]  real quick. This universe,
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.100]  Andrew. Big L.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.720]  A few days later. I'm convinced, though,
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.260]  whatever you die in your
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.020]  original universe and you have to switch to the other one
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:42.280]  and continue living, it's
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.100]  never as good as the previous universe.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:46.480]  Do you get, like,
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.380]  generation loss? Like, you're a little shittier
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:49.840]  each time, like copying a VHS tape?
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.220]  I don't think I have
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:53.960]  changed. Just the universe?
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.060]  Yeah.
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:58.480]  There's a worse world than what we're in.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:07:59.820]  No, there's not.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.260]  If you die here,
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.400]  it only gets worse? I can't imagine
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:06.600]  that.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.540]  That's what you're saying, right?
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.200]  Well, I mean, I was,
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.340]  everything was going alright, and then, you know,
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:16.160]  narrowly avoid death, and then there was, like,
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.060]  COVID and all this other weird stuff.
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.620]  It's definitely, like, a weirder version.
[01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.360]  So did we all die? And now
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.680]  we're here? Are you sure this is the good one?
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:26.400]  No, no, no. You still
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.020]  exist on the good one.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:29.840]  But I'm dead in it.
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:30.760]  Right?
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.240]  But now, because I kept living
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.080]  in my universe, I have my
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.140]  new universe's version of you guys.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:39.940]  Can you
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:41.100]  do me a favor?
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.700]  Can you draw this out on a whiteboard?
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.940]  Yeah, that might help, because I was on board,
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:46.800]  now I'm off board.
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.800]  What do you need help with? Just draw the whole thing,
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.860]  and then let us know. And I'm not just talking about you guys,
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.280]  I'm talking about everyone listening, too.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.820]  We share the universe.
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:56.800]  We share this one.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.160]  Until one of us dies.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.860]  And then they move to their own universe,
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:03.300]  where they share it with other people?
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:05.780]  This universe we're currently in is
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:07.640]  permanent, and the people who die
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.880]  will die, but they'll just switch to their
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.720]  next universe.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.640]  That's permanent.
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:14.960]  The next one is worse.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.700]  It'll be worse for the people who died.
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:19.640]  We get to stay in this one.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.640]  We get to stay in this one,
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.900]  and the next one is worse when you die
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:25.820]  here. I just can't, I can't
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:27.940]  wrap my head around the next one is worse.
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:29.500]  Why?
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.520]  Why does it have to be worse?
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.080]  Can't it be better? Can you change your theory?
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:35.540]  Just in my experience, they're a bit
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.480]  worse after.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:39.580]  Before we wrap this
[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:41.400]  episode, I just got a slack from
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.800]  TPG that is, the plunger arrived.
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:45.920]  Oh my god!
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:50.220]  Well,
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:53.060]  head on over
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:55.080]  to store.roosterteeth.com while you can
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.280]  and get a Rady Boy shirt.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.740]  Have you seen how many we've sold of those?
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:09:59.980]  How many?
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:02.400]  Thank you for supporting us.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.220]  So much. We've sold
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.700]  so many of that shirt. Thank you guys
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.920]  for buying the Rady Boy shirt. I hate him.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.660]  I hate Rady Boy. Thank you for buying
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:12.700]  the shirt. I hate him. Look at his fucking
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.600]  I hate this art. It makes me so mad.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.080]  Look at his little fucking face.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.600]  Look at him. His Bart Simpson
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.740]  fucking shirt. Can I get one of them?
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:22.960]  Yeah. You better get it fast.
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:26.980]  So I
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.840]  assume we'll have, at some point,
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.920]  some new information. We just don't have
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.440]  anything yet.
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:34.880]  I think it's okay to talk through that a little bit.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.020]  Listen, the reality is
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:38.840]  is that we're
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.160]  the company's
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.020]  going to end and all of the
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:44.220]  intellectual property will
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.720]  be owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.760]  I mean, it already is, right?
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.900]  That's how it works. And we
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:52.860]  honestly don't know
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.940]  what's going to happen. There are
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.940]  a lot of people doing a lot of
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.920]  hard work trying to untangle
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.900]  this and figure it out. Because there's a lot
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.960]  of different entertainment properties in Rooster Teeth
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.580]  that a lot of people would like to continue.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:07.040]  And I will say, I don't want to say anything
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.980]  that's going to fuck us over or put my
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:10.640]  foot in my mouth or say anything dumb
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.100]  that I don't mean to because I really don't know a lot
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:15.220]  at this moment. But over the next
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.220]  few weeks
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.200]  it's not going to be a
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.140]  quick thing to unravel.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.380]  We're going to go through the process of figuring
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:24.300]  out what we can
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.580]  do about that. Can we
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:28.400]  take the f*** face brand and continue
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.800]  on with it as such?
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.360]  And maintain
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.160]  the back catalog and the gameplay content
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:34.460]  and stuff?
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:37.720]  Or will it look different going forward?
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.380]  We don't know. The one thing that we do
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:41.960]  know is that we
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.500]  are going forward. This podcast
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.140]  will continue to exist.
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:48.120]  As a matter of fact, if anything
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.080]  it's only going to get bigger and f*** better.
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:51.700]  Because I think everybody
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:54.360]  involved with it is only motivated
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.480]  to kick the shit out of the future.
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:00.180]  Hell yeah. Absolutely.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.300]  I can't wait. I'm excited.
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:03.920]  Yeah, it's
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.760]  incredible. I'm so excited as well.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.120]  That point.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.280]  We're also not immediately going anywhere.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.040]  The show is going to continue on for
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.180]  I'd assume the next, whatever, month
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:14.740]  or two months.
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:18.060]  I'll say this. My goal, and I can't promise that we'll do this,
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.260]  but my goal is that the audience won't notice.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:21.520]  We won't skip a beat.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:21.840]  Yeah.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.540]  They may, listen,
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.260]  some supplemental content and some gameplay content
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.060]  might slow down a little bit as we try to
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:31.580]  figure that part of it out.
[01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.600]  But I don't want this podcast,
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:36.200]  I don't want there to ever be a week without this podcast on the internet.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.020]  I agree.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:39.780]  And hopeful.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.000]  That's obviously not a promise, but if we can
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.120]  deliver on that, we would love to be able to.
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:45.560]  We're going to do our goddamnedest.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.380]  Can I share the art that the
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:49.960]  Ratty Boy announcement also
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.920]  to add to the tonal
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.700]  how it really
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:56.160]  it plays differently. My thought was that
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.920]  our mascot would have like
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.200]  sort of a beef with the Rooster Teeth mascot
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.060]  as like an itchy and scratchy
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:03.980]  thing, but Ratty Boy
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:05.520]  driving a semi-truck
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.040]  running Artie out of
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:08.580]  Austin.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.020]  Damn!
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:12.820]  It's unfortunate.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.960]  God damn
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.060]  the timing is
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:18.020]  fucking insane.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.740]  I will say, Nick
[01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:22.460]  said the funniest, darkest thing to me
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:24.280]  the other day, but it really tickled me
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.400]  and it made me laugh when I really needed it, when he said
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.280]  I guess the name Artie's free.
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.660]  You can rename
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:31.540]  your dog again.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.240]  I forgot
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.660]  where we'd originally talked about
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.560]  that, but that was like a Halo
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.860]  Doubles let's play that came out.
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.480]  If you want to hear the moment where Geoff
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.620]  realizes he doesn't want to name his dog
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.740]  Artie. Oh yeah, I guess it didn't happen
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:47.180]  on Facebook.
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.260]  It's because you suck.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.100]  You fucking suck ass dipshits.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:53.300]  It's only Andrew.
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:55.320]  Nah, you're all the same person.
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.620]  You say Artie and it's the mascot's
[01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:00.520]  name. I don't know. I didn't name the mascot
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.580]  or the dog. I really
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:04.480]  feel like I'm not at all responsible
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.400]  for any of this.
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.540]  I don't think I even knew the mascot had a name in that
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.540]  video. The dog is most
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:12.500]  definitely an Albert at this point in his life
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.660]  and that is who, he is imbued
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:16.460]  with Albert-isms, so he's
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:17.800]  that name's stuck.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.400]  Oh, another thing that we, I couldn't quite remember
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.480]  where I knew it from, when I found
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.360]  out that Geoff had been recording all his piss
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.260]  it wasn't Emily that told me, it was
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:28.280]  we found out in the middle of a does it do.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:30.420]  Oh,
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.440]  did we? You were just playing, you were trying to
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.660]  play a fart into that
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:36.440]  shitty part of the video
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.060]  that we didn't want to make, and
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:40.080]  you just kept playing piss in my ear.
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:41.340]  Magic ear, that was it.
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:45.980]  Oh
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:48.220]  Christ. I guess
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.620]  we should probably wrap up.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:51.620]  Thanks for listening.
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.760]  Thanks for...
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.680]  What? Let's try to be sincere.
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:57.880]  I mean, no, I know it's just
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:00.200]  contextually, we should probably
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.220]  wrap up, like, it's different
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.260]  at this current time. We should wrap up
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.360]  this episode so that we
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.060]  can get to editing it
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:10.240]  so that we can release it, so that we can begin
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.780]  working on the next episode.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.160]  I just wanted to say, thanks
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.300]  for 197 episodes of
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:18.220]  support. We really appreciate it.
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:19.960]  That's an understatement.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.080]  I'll be honest with you, I'm
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.080]  pretty overwhelmed emotionally right now
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.180]  and I definitely don't have
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:28.380]  I feel like I'm underwater a little
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.240]  bit, so I don't have the things to say
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.340]  that I would like to be able to say.
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.220]  But it means everything to us
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:36.140]  that you have supported us along the way
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:38.020]  and we promise
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:39.560]  that we want to continue
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:42.420]  and that if you will allow us your ears
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:44.160]  we will do everything in our power
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.980]  to continue to entertain you. Thank you.
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.200]  Love you.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:48.460]  Love you too.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.520]  That sounded so weird.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.260]  What sounded weird?
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:58.600]  Gavin's like, love you.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.060]  I thought it sounded sincere.
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.140]  It was very sincere
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:04.300]  and it was very sweet.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:06.920]  And then I thought, oh I should say something.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.460]  Hold on, I didn't.
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.340]  Let me be clear, I just want to know real fast.
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.540]  We're making fun of Gavin here, not Geoff, right?
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.760]  We're not making fun of you.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.380]  Fuck Gavin, he sounds like he's an idiot.
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:17.540]  I'm right on board with you.
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.700]  Let me get another take.
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:21.920]  No, the episode's over dude, we already cut.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.440]  No, just do that last bit again.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.000]  I'll do it again, but it's already cut.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:25.920]  We can't do that.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.940]  Something, something, and then, oh my god.
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:33.520]  We just want to keep making content for you.
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:35.960]  You guys mean the world to us.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:36.520]  And we love you.
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.300]  Hey, can I, sorry, one sec.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:39.120]  What is happening?
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.360]  What the fuck is going on?
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.780]  I need one second.
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:47.460]  Remember how a lot of this episode was about how everything's my fault
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:49.120]  and that I'm the reason for all the problems?
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.660]  My recording stopped ten minutes into this.
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:53.180]  You're an idiot.
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:55.000]  You're a stupid bastard.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.420]  Are you serious?
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.780]  When I unplugged my mic
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:00.900]  because it was acting up,
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.080]  it stopped recording.
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:04.200]  So when you left to
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:06.840]  reprint the lore or whatever you're doing,
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.320]  we don't have anything after that?
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.300]  It's ten minutes
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:12.260]  when my recording has stopped.
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.260]  Right, the answer's no.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.720]  Luckily we have Craig, maybe hopefully.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:17.400]  Craig?
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:18.920]  Bye!
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:20.320]  Bye!
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:23.000]  Andrew, what would you do if we were a real podcast?
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:24.360]  This is crazy.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:25.320]  Goddamn.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.380]  I think I would still be unemployed.
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:29.980]  I don't think it would change anything.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.000]  I think I would be equally employed.
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.080]  I'm gonna go flush my head in the toilet.
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:34.920]  I'll see you guys later.
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:35.340]  Bye!
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:40.240]  Alright, let's cut.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.660]  Andrew, you don't have to cut. You're fine.
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:43.340]  You already got it.
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.260]  I'm already in the next afterlife
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:47.680]  or whatever.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:49.900]  I'm way ahead of all of you.
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:53.060]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.480]  with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:57.220]  Once again, due to reasons
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:58.700]  the boys haven't recorded yet.
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.480]  So in lieu of that, a poem by Dylan Thomas.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.860]  Do not go gentle into that good night.
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:05.320]  Old age should burn
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:06.620]  and rage at close of day.
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:09.280]  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.220]  The wise men at their inn know
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.200]  dark is right. Because their words
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.360]  had forked no lightning, they do not
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.920]  go gentle into that good night.
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.200]  Good men, the last wave by,
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.160]  crying how bright their frail deeds
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.680]  might have danced in a green bay.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.620]  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:27.320]  Wild men who caught and
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.220]  sang the sun in flight and learned
[01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:31.600]  too late, they grieved it on its way.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.400]  Do not go gentle into that
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.600]  good night. Brave men near death
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.360]  who see with blinding sight,
[01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:39.600]  blind eyes could blaze like meteors
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.140]  and be gay. Rage,
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.880]  rage against the dying of the light.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.400]  And you, my father,
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.720]  there on the sad height, curse,
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.620]  bless me now with your fierce tears,
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.720]  I pray. Do not go gentle
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.600]  into that good night. Rage,
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:54.420]  rage against the dying of the light.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.820]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:58.860]  pencil. All that and more on next week's
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:00.120]  episode of F*** Face.
