[00:10.460 --> 00:14.860]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:15.260 --> 00:18.340]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[00:18.440 --> 00:22.980]  I believe this is episode 200. Not our 200th episode, but episode 200.
[00:23.580 --> 00:24.500]  That's correct.
[00:25.240 --> 00:25.800]  Cool.
[00:26.460 --> 00:27.640]  You sound hot for 200.
[00:28.100 --> 00:29.300]  What the f***?
[00:30.080 --> 00:31.520]  What do you want from me?
[00:31.840 --> 00:33.920]  No, you're acting like that's my fault.
[00:34.080 --> 00:36.280]  I said, I said that's correct.
[00:37.160 --> 00:38.800]  Just, could've been anything.
[00:39.120 --> 00:40.840]  This is a Gavin issue.
[00:41.480 --> 00:43.020]  I said that's correct.
[00:43.660 --> 00:45.160]  Could you imagine New Year's Eve?
[00:45.400 --> 00:48.220]  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[00:48.320 --> 00:49.340]  2024, that's right.
[00:49.800 --> 00:50.820]  Factually accurate.
[00:51.760 --> 00:54.540]  Did your enthusiasm get laid off too, Andrew?
[00:54.700 --> 00:55.860]  I'm sick!
[00:56.160 --> 00:57.240]  You know I'm sick!
[00:57.800 --> 01:00.440]  I cancelled a recording because I'm sick.
[01:00.780 --> 01:01.800]  And now you're coming at me?
[01:02.000 --> 01:03.720]  Oh no, okay. Never mind.
[01:03.900 --> 01:05.560]  I'll be Mr. Enthusiastic.
[01:06.600 --> 01:07.740]  Go ahead, Geoff.
[01:07.960 --> 01:08.660]  Tell me something.
[01:10.680 --> 01:11.960]  Alright, I'll tell you something.
[01:12.180 --> 01:12.980]  Let's see.
[01:14.940 --> 01:15.820]  I have a question.
[01:15.840 --> 01:17.280]  Oh my god!
[01:17.380 --> 01:20.340]  Really? Holy f***!
[01:20.860 --> 01:21.340]  Wow!
[01:22.580 --> 01:23.260]  Oh s***.
[01:24.060 --> 01:24.540]  Incredible!
[01:25.420 --> 01:27.160]  You don't know the answer to the question yet.
[01:27.660 --> 01:28.300]  You don't know the question?
[01:29.100 --> 01:31.520]  I might faint if I hear it. This is so exciting.
[01:31.640 --> 01:32.820]  Go ahead. Continue.
[01:32.820 --> 01:34.380]  I blew out your throat.
[01:35.340 --> 01:37.440]  I just wanted to see how everybody's feeling.
[01:38.320 --> 01:38.920]  Fantastic!
[01:40.920 --> 01:41.320]  Woo!
[01:41.500 --> 01:42.260]  What a day!
[01:43.060 --> 01:45.120]  What a great day for
[01:45.120 --> 01:47.100]  200th episode that isn't
[01:47.100 --> 01:48.260]  actually 200.
[01:48.840 --> 01:50.520]  Sounds like Chris Folley.
[01:51.240 --> 01:51.760]  Woo!
[01:57.160 --> 01:58.880]  Alright, well that was my only question.
[01:59.000 --> 01:59.900]  Anybody else got anything to add?
[02:00.360 --> 02:01.560]  I don't have a lot.
[02:01.820 --> 02:04.180]  Because I've been sick, as mentioned before.
[02:04.280 --> 02:05.560]  But I got a few things.
[02:05.900 --> 02:06.600]  You got bad throat?
[02:06.920 --> 02:09.840]  I got bad everything. Bad chest, bad throat, bad sleep.
[02:09.860 --> 02:10.800]  How are the ankles?
[02:11.340 --> 02:13.440]  Bad. Bad ankles. Well, it's all bad.
[02:13.880 --> 02:15.680]  You manifested this though by doing
[02:15.680 --> 02:17.160]  the dog thing.
[02:17.960 --> 02:19.280]  Listen, it's gotten worse.
[02:19.380 --> 02:22.200]  I've had one of the all time bad dumb brain weeks
[02:22.200 --> 02:23.060]  I've had in a while.
[02:23.520 --> 02:26.220]  To the point where I no longer trust myself
[02:26.220 --> 02:28.660]  on anything. I'm now running by every thought I have.
[02:28.660 --> 02:31.460]  Because I've had a combination
[02:31.460 --> 02:33.160]  of realizing
[02:33.160 --> 02:34.820]  that Jesus Christ, am I in
[02:34.820 --> 02:37.340]  I'm in a world of my own as far as
[02:37.340 --> 02:39.220]  It's a bad combination of
[02:39.220 --> 02:41.060]  being open to almost
[02:41.060 --> 02:42.940]  any idea being a possibility
[02:42.940 --> 02:43.840]  in some form.
[02:45.480 --> 02:47.000]  Just a logic
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.160]  of this makes sense to me so therefore
[02:49.160 --> 02:50.000]  it works for everyone.
[02:50.480 --> 02:51.920]  I guess I'll do this linearly
[02:51.920 --> 02:53.820]  in my realizations.
[02:54.400 --> 02:56.920]  I've been going through a lot of forms recently
[02:56.920 --> 02:59.460]  and my partner looked at one of them and said
[02:59.460 --> 03:01.040]  that it's funny, they have you listed
[03:01.660 --> 03:03.440]  as a research and
[03:03.440 --> 03:04.940]  architectural assistant
[03:05.480 --> 03:06.560]  as your job.
[03:07.600 --> 03:09.380]  And I was like, oh, I know why
[03:09.380 --> 03:10.840]  that is. And I was
[03:11.420 --> 03:13.380]  all ready to drop the logic bomb
[03:13.380 --> 03:15.460]  of like, oh no, you're going to see my point
[03:15.460 --> 03:16.760]  in a moment. And I said,
[03:17.280 --> 03:19.560]  I have that title, I gave myself
[03:19.560 --> 03:21.380]  that job title, because when I
[03:21.380 --> 03:23.540]  first started doing contract stuff
[03:23.540 --> 03:25.480]  with Rooster Teeth, I would help
[03:25.480 --> 03:27.700]  Matt Bragg build maps in Minecraft
[03:28.440 --> 03:29.420]  and that's why
[03:29.420 --> 03:31.520]  it's like architecture. And they said
[03:31.520 --> 03:33.500]  that's not architect- you're playing a
[03:33.500 --> 03:35.520]  video game. That's not architecture.
[03:35.980 --> 03:36.860]  You're not an architect.
[03:37.640 --> 03:39.500]  The government thinks you're an architect,
[03:39.620 --> 03:41.160]  you're not an architect. It would be like
[03:41.160 --> 03:43.360]  if I said that my job was
[03:43.360 --> 03:45.440]  farmer because I played Stardew Valley.
[03:45.620 --> 03:47.680]  That's not what my profession is.
[03:48.340 --> 03:49.640]  It has nothing to do-
[03:49.640 --> 03:51.380]  it's just a lie. I've just been lying
[03:51.380 --> 03:53.500]  about what I did at that time in my life.
[03:53.500 --> 03:54.960]  So what form is this on, though?
[03:55.040 --> 03:55.920]  It's a tax form.
[03:58.360 --> 03:58.920]  Well...
[03:58.920 --> 04:01.300]  It's a tax form.
[04:01.820 --> 04:02.700]  It's a tax form.
[04:02.960 --> 04:05.580]  I don't know that it's incorrect, though, Andrew.
[04:05.920 --> 04:07.200]  I mean, you're-
[04:07.200 --> 04:07.500]  Oh, wow.
[04:07.880 --> 04:11.440]  You're building in- it may be in a
[04:11.440 --> 04:13.760]  3D space, but it's still architecture.
[04:14.080 --> 04:15.600]  You're still creating
[04:15.600 --> 04:17.360]  and designing buildings, just because
[04:17.360 --> 04:19.180]  they're happening virtually
[04:19.180 --> 04:21.600]  and not in a brick and mortar
[04:21.600 --> 04:23.360]  way doesn't make it any less
[04:23.900 --> 04:24.980]  architecture, I wouldn't think.
[04:25.120 --> 04:25.960]  Fuck the government.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.060]  The government didn't have a problem-
[04:29.060 --> 04:32.080]  America, I love you. Please don't audit me.
[04:35.280 --> 04:37.560]  I just never- to me, it made all
[04:37.560 --> 04:39.680]  the sense in the world, and then when that point was brought up
[04:39.680 --> 04:41.240]  I thought, you know what, that is also fair.
[04:41.340 --> 04:43.660]  It never occurred to me that someone could read
[04:43.660 --> 04:44.920]  that and think I am an architect.
[04:45.260 --> 04:47.500]  But that would be an understandable
[04:47.500 --> 04:48.960]  path. I'm gonna put
[04:48.960 --> 04:50.960]  Astroneer as my next occupation.
[04:51.460 --> 04:51.840]  Ooh!
[04:53.160 --> 04:54.040]  That's a good one.
[04:55.220 --> 04:56.980]  The other realization I
[04:56.980 --> 04:58.840]  had shortly after that was
[04:58.840 --> 05:01.000]  I was talking to somebody, probably
[05:01.000 --> 05:02.940]  like two weeks ago, and they were
[05:02.940 --> 05:04.720]  telling me about how they were getting into painting
[05:05.860 --> 05:07.080]  recently, and that
[05:07.080 --> 05:08.940]  they planned on-
[05:08.940 --> 05:10.820]  they're like, yeah, we did a painting night,
[05:10.900 --> 05:13.060]  it was a lot of fun, I surprisingly enjoyed
[05:13.060 --> 05:14.120]  it more than I thought I would.
[05:14.600 --> 05:16.720]  I think we're gonna get together this weekend
[05:16.720 --> 05:17.880]  and paint someone's cat.
[05:18.860 --> 05:20.220]  I interpreted that
[05:20.220 --> 05:22.060]  as a literal cat painting.
[05:22.580 --> 05:24.660]  I thought that they were gonna
[05:24.660 --> 05:26.800]  paint this cat, and I had
[05:26.800 --> 05:28.580]  so many questions, I was like, really?
[05:28.720 --> 05:30.860]  Wow, I've never heard of that before. That's all I said.
[05:31.860 --> 05:32.940]  Yes, I guess.
[05:33.080 --> 05:34.880]  I don't remember that movie. Do they paint the cat
[05:34.880 --> 05:36.720]  in that movie? Yeah, he like spray
[05:36.720 --> 05:38.680]  paints the cat at one point. That's
[05:38.680 --> 05:40.440]  great. Now I was imagining like
[05:40.440 --> 05:42.680]  a group of people sitting around
[05:42.680 --> 05:44.680]  a cat with brushes painting this
[05:44.680 --> 05:46.740]  cat, and I had so many thoughts
[05:46.740 --> 05:48.800]  of like, what type of paint do you
[05:48.800 --> 05:50.560]  use? Like, what would be humane for it?
[05:51.060 --> 05:52.640]  Maybe it's a hairless cat
[05:52.640 --> 05:54.340]  and they're just painting on the skin
[05:54.340 --> 05:56.640]  and that's why it's okay with it, but also
[05:56.640 --> 05:58.720]  like, what type of cat would be fine with
[05:58.720 --> 06:00.740]  that? Like, I've never encountered a cat
[06:00.740 --> 06:02.540]  that would be that relaxed about
[06:02.540 --> 06:04.520]  the act of them being painted.
[06:05.240 --> 06:06.080]  And uh,
[06:06.440 --> 06:08.680]  it just moved on, and that has been in
[06:08.680 --> 06:10.480]  my head for the past two weeks of
[06:10.480 --> 06:12.680]  I wonder if they painted this cat.
[06:12.680 --> 06:14.140]  Did that cat ever get painted?
[06:14.840 --> 06:16.600]  You know how at kids' birthday parties
[06:16.600 --> 06:18.900]  they'll paint a cat face on a kid?
[06:19.120 --> 06:20.560]  Yes! Has anyone ever painted
[06:20.560 --> 06:21.920]  a human face onto a cat?
[06:22.720 --> 06:23.600]  Oh man!
[06:26.320 --> 06:28.100]  I don't think I want to see that.
[06:30.460 --> 06:32.460]  Is there a celebrity face that
[06:32.460 --> 06:34.760]  immediately comes to mind for you when you think of a cat?
[06:34.960 --> 06:36.300]  A cat with a human face?
[06:36.740 --> 06:37.540]  John C. Reilly.
[06:38.580 --> 06:38.820]  Oh!
[06:39.900 --> 06:41.060]  The idea of
[06:41.060 --> 06:41.740]  at a
[06:43.680 --> 06:44.980]  local state fair
[06:45.660 --> 06:46.740]  or just like a local
[06:46.740 --> 06:48.340]  carnival, there's a fucking
[06:49.560 --> 06:50.140]  there's a
[06:51.100 --> 06:52.820]  face painting station, but it's only
[06:52.820 --> 06:53.580]  for cats.
[06:55.300 --> 06:56.760]  What do you want to paint your cat? You want your cat
[06:56.760 --> 06:58.900]  to be a dog? You want your cat to be an accountant?
[06:59.120 --> 07:00.400]  A dragon? Whatever you want.
[07:02.060 --> 07:02.440]  It's like
[07:02.440 --> 07:04.080]  aggressively against
[07:04.080 --> 07:07.060]  like, no kids! No kids!
[07:07.940 --> 07:08.700]  It's like, I
[07:08.700 --> 07:11.000]  just want, you can't, you got nobody
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.280]  I don't care! No kids! I'm a cat painter.
[07:14.100 --> 07:14.420]  Oh.
[07:14.880 --> 07:17.080]  They don't do anyone, they've never had a client
[07:17.080 --> 07:19.140]  ever at any fair that they've been booked at
[07:19.140 --> 07:20.320]  they just stand there and wait.
[07:20.860 --> 07:22.960]  For one day. But uh
[07:22.960 --> 07:24.740]  yeah, I thought their cat was being painted
[07:24.740 --> 07:26.740]  and I lived for two weeks, I wondered like
[07:26.740 --> 07:29.000]  was the cat okay? What's on the cat?
[07:29.660 --> 07:31.000]  So you're not really second guessing
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.180]  anything at the moment? I don't second
[07:33.180 --> 07:34.980]  guess anything really in general is
[07:34.980 --> 07:37.140]  the problem. You're a first guess guy.
[07:37.800 --> 07:38.800]  I'm a not ask
[07:38.800 --> 07:40.940]  questions first guess guy, I'll ask
[07:40.940 --> 07:43.120]  internal questions about it, but then
[07:44.140 --> 07:45.060]  if it checks
[07:45.060 --> 07:47.160]  out, it checks out. I went, okay they're painting a cat
[07:47.160 --> 07:49.180]  this person's a good person
[07:49.180 --> 07:51.240]  they're gonna be aware of humane things
[07:51.240 --> 07:53.340]  it's all above board
[07:53.340 --> 07:55.040]  whatever, this is their
[07:55.040 --> 07:56.660]  thing. They're in the cat painting. This is
[07:57.240 --> 07:58.600]  probably gonna change
[07:58.600 --> 08:01.160]  how I have conversations with you going forward
[08:01.160 --> 08:01.840]  for a little bit.
[08:01.840 --> 08:02.960]  This knowledge.
[08:03.720 --> 08:05.860]  But I don't trust you in that same
[08:05.860 --> 08:07.540]  way. So you
[08:08.280 --> 08:09.440]  so the first
[08:09.440 --> 08:11.700]  safeguard is, okay I'm
[08:11.700 --> 08:13.080]  dealing with this person
[08:13.700 --> 08:16.000]  So immediately you loaded the second guess
[08:16.000 --> 08:17.600]  and maybe a third guess because it's Geoff.
[08:18.000 --> 08:19.900]  So you're a face value
[08:19.900 --> 08:21.620]  guy unless it's my face?
[08:22.200 --> 08:23.340]  No, it's uh
[08:23.340 --> 08:25.820]  unless it is a John C. Reilly's face
[08:25.820 --> 08:26.540]  on a cat
[08:27.640 --> 08:29.560]  That's my face value, but
[08:29.560 --> 08:31.200]  but fuck you Geoff
[08:31.200 --> 08:33.720]  one of my oldest, dearest friends
[08:33.720 --> 08:35.660]  Yeah, well Geoff as you'd
[08:35.660 --> 08:37.660]  say for me, you're always up for a little bit
[08:37.660 --> 08:39.220]  of mischief, there could be some jokes going on
[08:39.220 --> 08:41.320]  I haven't trusted a thing you've said to me
[08:41.320 --> 08:42.760]  since we started this podcast
[08:42.760 --> 08:45.580]  A prank is in the works at me
[08:45.580 --> 08:47.440]  so yeah, whenever the Geoff
[08:47.440 --> 08:49.420]  firewall will ignite whenever we
[08:49.420 --> 08:50.860]  initiate a talk, but then
[08:50.860 --> 08:53.580]  you know, it'll process and I'm not
[08:53.580 --> 08:55.540]  saying you're not gonna get anything through, but there's
[08:55.540 --> 08:56.780]  a little bit more resistance
[08:57.360 --> 08:58.860]  That uh, well I appreciate
[08:58.860 --> 09:00.420]  a challenge, that uh
[09:00.420 --> 09:02.900]  that prank by the way, it's
[09:02.900 --> 09:04.740]  so fucked, it got so fucked up
[09:04.740 --> 09:05.740]  by uh
[09:06.500 --> 09:09.000]  well, you know, us all losing our jobs
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.100]  and everything, that uh
[09:11.100 --> 09:12.780]  it's really set me back
[09:12.780 --> 09:14.680]  a bit, I'm not even sure where all the elements
[09:14.680 --> 09:16.100]  of the prank are to be honest with you
[09:16.100 --> 09:18.900]  I gotta put it all back together at some point
[09:18.900 --> 09:20.280]  really, really got sidelined
[09:20.280 --> 09:22.520]  I'm glad, you know what, I've been, you know
[09:22.520 --> 09:24.860]  I've had actually an issue with you recently Geoff
[09:24.860 --> 09:26.280]  Oh shit
[09:27.060 --> 09:27.580]  Jesus
[09:29.280 --> 09:30.860]  You've ruined, it's not your
[09:30.860 --> 09:32.680]  fault, it's kind of your fault, but
[09:32.680 --> 09:34.860]  it's not your fault, there are
[09:34.860 --> 09:36.720]  few things that gave me
[09:36.720 --> 09:38.860]  joy, than hearing that your house
[09:38.860 --> 09:40.740]  was fucked up, or that your fridge
[09:40.740 --> 09:43.000]  was broken, or that your bike
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.800]  exploded, it always, it
[09:44.800 --> 09:46.860]  brought such a laugh, it brought me a lot
[09:46.860 --> 09:48.840]  of joy, now that you don't
[09:48.840 --> 09:50.860]  have a job like the rest of us
[09:50.860 --> 09:53.080]  it's a lot harder to enjoy
[09:53.080 --> 09:55.160]  those things, and I've been
[09:55.160 --> 09:56.820]  I'm struggling, I'm still
[09:56.820 --> 09:58.800]  looking for something to fill that
[09:58.800 --> 10:01.080]  hole I now have, and the
[10:01.080 --> 10:02.600]  joy that was there from that
[10:02.600 --> 10:04.520]  and I haven't found it yet, but
[10:05.080 --> 10:07.140]  it's not your fault, you didn't close the
[10:07.140 --> 10:09.240]  company, but you were part of making the company
[10:09.240 --> 10:11.280]  but then it's like a thing of like
[10:11.280 --> 10:13.080]  if you never made it, then
[10:13.080 --> 10:14.740]  I would never have that joy
[10:14.740 --> 10:17.020]  it just would have never existed, so I think it's
[10:17.020 --> 10:19.340]  it's better to avoid, what's the expression
[10:19.340 --> 10:21.260]  lost love than never loved at all
[10:21.260 --> 10:23.140]  or whatever, better to love than
[10:23.140 --> 10:25.560]  to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
[10:25.560 --> 10:27.240]  exactly, that's where I'm at with it
[10:27.240 --> 10:29.380]  but I'm still, I'm in that finding phase
[10:29.380 --> 10:30.560]  of what that new joy will be
[10:31.040 --> 10:33.080]  can you imagine if 21
[10:33.080 --> 10:35.260]  years ago or whatever, me and
[10:35.260 --> 10:36.920]  those dipshits, the ugly ones
[10:36.920 --> 10:39.020]  we didn't start Rooster Teeth together
[10:39.700 --> 10:41.420]  we wouldn't be talking right now
[10:41.420 --> 10:43.220]  we wouldn't have each other in our lives
[10:43.220 --> 10:45.400]  I assume, I mean it would be wild
[10:45.400 --> 10:47.440]  if we did, like we still managed
[10:47.440 --> 10:49.140]  to come together across three countries
[10:49.140 --> 10:50.840]  and three different generations
[10:50.840 --> 10:52.460]  I don't think I would have made it
[10:53.780 --> 10:55.120]  Gavin, you and I meet up
[10:55.120 --> 10:56.900]  but Geoff never gets to the fault
[10:56.900 --> 10:59.720]  I don't, yeah, I don't know, I don't know what would have happened
[10:59.720 --> 11:01.460]  under no normal circumstances
[11:01.460 --> 11:03.340]  would I ever have crossed Geoff
[11:03.340 --> 11:03.840]  alright
[11:04.860 --> 11:06.740]  how would I have found you?
[11:06.900 --> 11:08.460]  I don't know, video games?
[11:09.140 --> 11:10.540]  but you're not a Halo guy
[11:10.540 --> 11:12.960]  I used to be, that's how Rooster Teeth started
[11:14.020 --> 11:15.720]  I'm just not a Halo guy anymore
[11:15.720 --> 11:16.980]  because I did it for a thousand
[11:16.980 --> 11:17.720]  fucking years
[11:17.720 --> 11:19.880]  I was thinking the other day about
[11:19.880 --> 11:21.780]  you know when we
[11:22.280 --> 11:23.820]  this was probably like 2007
[11:23.820 --> 11:25.520]  and we would go to the office
[11:25.520 --> 11:27.860]  and sometimes we would decide to walk to the office
[11:27.860 --> 11:29.100]  when it was on congress
[11:29.660 --> 11:30.880]  and it took like an hour
[11:31.720 --> 11:33.960]  yeah, it was a couple miles
[11:33.960 --> 11:36.240]  and we would like talk the whole time
[11:36.240 --> 11:37.840]  what do you think we were talking about?
[11:38.280 --> 11:40.240]  do you ever wonder what we used to talk about?
[11:41.200 --> 11:41.500]  we
[11:42.280 --> 11:43.800]  it's a great question Gav
[11:43.800 --> 11:45.340]  because in addition to that
[11:45.340 --> 11:47.100]  when we were working down in Buda
[11:47.100 --> 11:49.740]  and we would drive down to Buda everyday together
[11:49.740 --> 11:50.560]  and then drive home
[11:50.560 --> 11:53.720]  that was like a 45 minute drive
[11:53.720 --> 11:55.140]  to an hour in traffic
[11:55.740 --> 11:57.160]  we talked the whole time
[11:57.160 --> 11:58.540]  what did we talk
[11:58.540 --> 12:01.140]  it makes me wonder like if I saw you tomorrow
[12:01.140 --> 12:02.960]  what would we talk about, I have no fucking clue
[12:02.960 --> 12:04.280]  clearly we come up with stuff
[12:04.280 --> 12:06.380]  yeah, we talk about current things
[12:06.380 --> 12:08.200]  but I would love to hear
[12:08.200 --> 12:10.660]  a trip down to Buda
[12:10.660 --> 12:12.420]  or a nice long walk
[12:12.420 --> 12:13.500]  to congress
[12:13.500 --> 12:15.400]  I guarantee you
[12:15.400 --> 12:18.780]  I don't know a single thing
[12:18.780 --> 12:20.400]  we talked about, but I guarantee you
[12:20.400 --> 12:23.340]  40% of it was laughing our asses off
[12:23.340 --> 12:23.680]  yeah
[12:24.740 --> 12:26.640]  I wonder if it would still be funny
[12:26.640 --> 12:29.040]  to hear it, if one of them was recorded
[12:29.040 --> 12:30.340]  or very embarrassing
[12:30.340 --> 12:31.040]  yeah
[12:31.040 --> 12:33.120]  it's gonna be embarrassing, right?
[12:33.200 --> 12:36.040]  I think it would mainly be Geoff lying to me about things
[12:36.620 --> 12:37.020]  laughing
[12:38.900 --> 12:40.020]  I have no idea where
[12:40.020 --> 12:42.280]  that branch came from, you got hit by a branch?
[12:43.220 --> 12:43.520]  laughing
[12:43.520 --> 12:46.180]  I really don't
[12:46.180 --> 12:47.780]  think I had anything to do with that, but man
[12:47.780 --> 12:50.080]  what if I did, I was drinking a lot back then
[12:50.080 --> 12:52.060]  it has crossed my mind
[12:52.060 --> 12:54.200]  that if I could have been drunk
[12:54.200 --> 12:55.520]  enough to think it was funny
[12:56.040 --> 12:57.120]  but I really don't think so
[12:57.660 --> 12:58.060]  laughing
[12:58.900 --> 13:01.500]  you had alcoholism as the perfect defense
[13:01.960 --> 13:02.860]  you were just waiting
[13:02.860 --> 13:04.140]  I really don't think so
[13:04.750 --> 13:05.020]  laughing
[13:05.020 --> 13:09.140]  it doesn't seem like my move, dropping a tree branch
[13:09.140 --> 13:09.700]  on somebody
[13:09.700 --> 13:13.100]  I'd have maybe kicked your foot out from under you
[13:13.100 --> 13:14.760]  while you were walking in the yard or something
[13:14.760 --> 13:17.140]  I don't think I'd use gravity
[13:17.140 --> 13:18.360]  against you in that way
[13:18.360 --> 13:21.020]  or bust into my bedroom to try and kick over all my
[13:21.020 --> 13:21.700]  xboxes
[13:22.240 --> 13:24.980]  Mr. Xboxes over here
[13:24.980 --> 13:26.100]  living the life
[13:26.100 --> 13:27.940]  all my xboxes
[13:27.940 --> 13:29.140]  they're for work
[13:29.760 --> 13:30.340]  oh
[13:30.340 --> 13:33.000]  work at Geoff's department
[13:33.640 --> 13:34.220]  laughing
[13:34.220 --> 13:36.340]  Geoff's department he says
[13:37.020 --> 13:37.600]  laughing
[13:38.960 --> 13:42.000]  why did you kick over all your xboxes
[13:42.000 --> 13:42.260]  Geoff
[13:42.260 --> 13:45.220]  I don't remember
[13:45.220 --> 13:46.620]  to be honest with you
[13:46.620 --> 13:48.140]  I bet there was a good reason at the time
[13:49.100 --> 13:49.680]  laughing
[13:49.680 --> 13:51.900]  probably made a lot of sense in the moment
[13:51.900 --> 13:53.020]  laughing
[13:55.880 --> 13:57.240]  we hung out
[13:57.620 --> 14:04.620]  And it was a lot of fun. Me and Eric and Nick all went to a basketball game last week together, which was a lot of fun.
[14:04.900 --> 14:08.460]  Well, I shouldn't say we went together. We all went and we were at there at the same time, so we hung out.
[14:08.940 --> 14:15.280]  But we sat, like, in different seats and stuff. But while we were there, and I was eating a hot dog, as I do at any sporting event,
[14:15.640 --> 14:26.100]  that got me thinking. Is there a food you can't say no to? Like, it may not be a food that you think about a lot or that you go out of your way to get,
[14:26.100 --> 14:29.800]  but if somebody offers it to you, you've never said no.
[14:30.420 --> 14:33.920]  Dark chocolate covered almonds. I'll always suck one of those down.
[14:35.360 --> 14:40.160]  Like, you could go years without thinking about them, but the second somebody offers you, no matter how full you are, you're like,
[14:40.220 --> 14:41.740]  well, yeah, I'm gonna have a couple of those. Yeah, I'll take three.
[14:42.080 --> 14:44.860]  We talking, like, snacks? We're talking, like, a snack food?
[14:45.740 --> 14:49.740]  It could be anything. Nick says pretzels, chips, and queso.
[14:50.540 --> 14:59.120]  Yeah, pretzels are good. Immediately, like, anything in the chicken realm comes to my mind.
[14:59.240 --> 15:02.800]  But there are times in which I'd be full, and I probably would reject chicken.
[15:02.960 --> 15:08.400]  So we're talking, like, maybe, like, a bite of this or a bite of that. Maybe, like, a ketchup chip.
[15:09.300 --> 15:14.220]  A great top chip, as we've all agreed, as we've all had a consensus on.
[15:15.000 --> 15:21.840]  So dark chocolate, salted almonds, and ketchup potato chips. Nick is pretzels, chips, and queso.
[15:22.420 --> 15:23.140]  Eric, what about you?
[15:24.140 --> 15:27.260]  I'd probably go french fries. I don't think that I could say no.
[15:27.520 --> 15:28.560]  Oh, french fries are good.
[15:28.660 --> 15:33.060]  They're so hard, especially if they're right there. It's so hard to say no to.
[15:33.400 --> 15:34.000]  Have they gotta be hot?
[15:34.840 --> 15:40.640]  I mean, I prefer it, but at the same time, I've eaten a lot of cold french fries.
[15:40.640 --> 15:46.700]  Like, I would prefer them to be hot, but man, I've eaten cold, cold french fries.
[15:46.880 --> 15:55.140]  So if we went out for a meal, and you had, like, a starter, a main, dessert, and then I just pulled out a little McDonald's chip.
[15:55.700 --> 15:56.420]  Oh, I'd have some.
[15:59.080 --> 16:00.900]  For me, it depends on the kind of fry.
[16:01.880 --> 16:02.220]  Yeah.
[16:02.460 --> 16:05.380]  For 80% of fry, I would, but there's some.
[16:05.620 --> 16:06.840]  What's a fry you don't like?
[16:07.460 --> 16:10.020]  Yeah, what do you not like? What are you turning down?
[16:10.020 --> 16:15.080]  It's not that I dislike, it's there is a wide range of success on a wedge fry.
[16:15.320 --> 16:19.600]  And when it is good, it is great, but there are a lot of bad wedge fries out there.
[16:20.140 --> 16:21.700]  So you would turn down a wedge fry?
[16:22.120 --> 16:23.240]  I think so, yeah.
[16:24.140 --> 16:27.100]  Just because you weren't... if you didn't understand, like, the...
[16:27.640 --> 16:34.120]  This is a scenario in my head that has been set up of if I'm completely full, if I'm, like, stuffed, and someone's like, hey, you want one of these?
[16:34.320 --> 16:36.380]  Yeah, well, I would pass on the wedge fry.
[16:37.100 --> 16:39.180]  Even if you knew it was cooked to perfection?
[16:39.180 --> 16:43.560]  No, well, that's a different thing. If I know it's cooked to perfection, I'd probably still take it.
[16:43.600 --> 16:48.340]  But if it's like a crinkle cut or a curly fry, I'm not questioning it. I'm just having it.
[16:48.820 --> 16:51.580]  Yeah, you're a first-guess guy, so you just go right for it.
[16:52.140 --> 16:52.300]  Yeah.
[16:52.380 --> 16:53.460]  Depends on who's holding the fries.
[16:53.940 --> 17:00.480]  Say I held you up a nice thing. What's the thing that contains fries? A fry container.
[17:00.860 --> 17:01.240]  Container?
[17:01.460 --> 17:02.200]  Yeah, a fry container.
[17:02.600 --> 17:03.620]  They don't have a...
[17:03.620 --> 17:08.580]  Say it was like a nice large... you've got long, nice fries coming out.
[17:08.580 --> 17:10.940]  Long, nice fries in a fry container. Got it.
[17:11.040 --> 17:17.000]  Poking out of the fries container. But there's just like a streak of cum across one side of it.
[17:19.280 --> 17:24.280]  The cum has hit maybe three or four fries on the right. Would you still take one from the left?
[17:24.980 --> 17:30.940]  Well, no, I think... I thought you were going to go with like, and a pickle, like we dipped it, like pickle touched it.
[17:31.000 --> 17:32.660]  And then you went cum, and that's different.
[17:33.200 --> 17:35.620]  Whose cum is it? Is it his own cum?
[17:35.620 --> 17:40.260]  Hang on, hang on. Before you answer that, does it matter, Geoff?
[17:41.360 --> 17:45.140]  I mean, I'm less grossed out by my body than other people's.
[17:45.220 --> 17:50.220]  So if you cummed on french fries, you'd be eating those fries?
[17:51.380 --> 18:00.260]  No, nothing that the cum touched. But if it's like brand new, hotly salted, golden, perfectly cooked, like McDonald's fries,
[18:00.700 --> 18:05.400]  and there's only three of them that have my cum on them, and there's like 80 fries that don't,
[18:05.400 --> 18:06.600]  I can eat around a little bit of cum.
[18:06.600 --> 18:08.620]  Hang on, hang on. Let's take it out, let's...
[18:08.620 --> 18:08.800]  What?
[18:09.300 --> 18:11.200]  You're telling me you've never heard of Alabama poutine?
[18:27.440 --> 18:33.080]  I love this conversation.
[18:33.080 --> 18:36.320]  I don't. I already said no, but let's take it...
[18:36.320 --> 18:36.740]  You said no in general.
[18:37.360 --> 18:39.860]  Yeah, I would, no. I would not eat cum french fries.
[18:40.100 --> 18:41.380]  It wouldn't be on the one you ate.
[18:41.660 --> 18:43.420]  I don't want to eat cum french fries.
[18:43.420 --> 18:46.300]  And it's your cum, and you know where it came from, because you put it there.
[18:46.360 --> 18:48.880]  Okay, so let's take it out of the realm of french fries.
[18:49.280 --> 18:56.760]  And Gavin, if there was cum on some dark chocolate covered almonds, you're eating around it?
[18:58.980 --> 18:59.380]  Um...
[18:59.380 --> 19:04.160]  What? How, how were you on me about it, and your answer is uh?
[19:04.560 --> 19:09.860]  Say there's like 10 dark chocolate covered almonds in a line on a table.
[19:10.240 --> 19:13.220]  No, no, they're in a dark chocolate covered almond container.
[19:13.400 --> 19:15.040]  Well, I think that's harder to get out, though.
[19:15.200 --> 19:15.780]  I agree.
[19:16.160 --> 19:17.520]  I'm going to be rummaging, and I'm going to be moving them.
[19:17.520 --> 19:18.640]  No, I agree with you, yeah.
[19:18.640 --> 19:25.440]  And more cum will go on more than it started with. I feel like with fries, you're just going to see some cum on the top.
[19:25.440 --> 19:30.680]  I think fries are the only food that's acceptable to eat around the cum.
[19:30.680 --> 19:36.860]  Oh, is that right? Geoff, Geoff, I've got a hot dog right in front of you, and you come on the left side of it.
[19:37.480 --> 19:39.060]  You come on the left side.
[19:39.220 --> 19:40.540]  It's even your own car.
[19:40.780 --> 19:44.140]  It's unfair because you and I have had this conversation already. You know my weakness.
[19:44.380 --> 19:48.300]  You come on the left side. So are you eating the right side of the dog?
[19:48.740 --> 19:49.780]  Here's how it's different.
[19:50.220 --> 19:50.520]  What?
[19:50.520 --> 19:53.620]  So what Eric is bringing up is what, we didn't get around to it.
[19:53.740 --> 19:54.540]  Well, I'm going to get there.
[19:54.540 --> 19:57.860]  We didn't, I'm going to give you some, I'm going to give you some, we've got an hour to kill here.
[19:57.940 --> 20:01.440]  You want the truth? You can't handle the truth.
[20:04.040 --> 20:10.240]  Listen, when we got back around to it, it would have come to the point where I admitted that a hot dog is the food that I can't say no to.
[20:10.320 --> 20:16.560]  To the point where, if you wanted to kill me, I think you could hand me a Chicago dog and watch me eat it.
[20:16.640 --> 20:20.640]  And as soon as I finished it, you could hand me another Chicago dog and watch me eat it.
[20:20.640 --> 20:25.280]  And as soon as I finished it, you could probably hand me another Chicago dog until I died.
[20:25.980 --> 20:29.100]  And I just would never be able to stop that specific hot dog.
[20:29.600 --> 20:31.260]  Here's how I think it's a little bit different.
[20:31.800 --> 20:35.940]  French fries are, it's like multiple items in the same container, right?
[20:36.080 --> 20:42.400]  If you come on part of a hot dog, it's connected, that part of the hot dog that's come on is connected to the rest of the hot dog.
[20:42.500 --> 20:43.200]  It's one unit.
[20:43.520 --> 20:49.520]  I think that there's a difference between individual units in the same container and a singular unit.
[20:49.520 --> 20:53.600]  I don't think I could eat it because it's the same dog.
[20:53.700 --> 20:58.480]  It'd be like if there was one giant wedge fry and you came on one side of the wedge fry but not the other.
[20:58.540 --> 21:00.500]  I don't think I could eat the other side of the wedge fry either.
[21:00.900 --> 21:02.580]  So they need to be distinct items.
[21:03.240 --> 21:03.880]  I think so.
[21:03.940 --> 21:06.680]  You couldn't eat the first bite of that hot dog.
[21:07.120 --> 21:08.540]  You're telling me you come on the left side.
[21:08.540 --> 21:09.160]  Is it my cum?
[21:09.680 --> 21:11.380]  Yes, your cum on the left side of the hot dog.
[21:11.520 --> 21:13.300]  I could eat half the hot dog.
[21:14.860 --> 21:16.740]  So, Eric, are you saying that you would as well?
[21:17.840 --> 21:19.860]  No, I've already said no to this.
[21:19.960 --> 21:22.740]  You've said no to any cum anywhere near your food?
[21:24.600 --> 21:24.880]  Yeah.
[21:25.880 --> 21:26.100]  Okay.
[21:26.740 --> 21:32.920]  We're at a sporting event and I'm eating a bowl of popcorn going, why is everybody cumming all over the place?
[21:33.480 --> 21:34.360]  What happened?
[21:36.680 --> 21:38.100]  Why did this happen?
[21:38.100 --> 21:38.620]  Who brought up the cum?
[21:40.420 --> 21:42.180]  That sounds like a Gavin thing. Was that you?
[21:42.360 --> 21:42.800]  Uh, yeah.
[21:43.480 --> 21:43.720]  Yeah.
[21:44.020 --> 21:45.600]  That kid is obsessed with jism.
[21:45.600 --> 21:46.660]  I don't know what it is.
[21:47.020 --> 21:48.580]  I thought that was a good conversation.
[21:49.220 --> 21:50.640]  That was great. I loved it.
[21:50.860 --> 21:54.660]  And also, in addition to that conversation, I have a question for you.
[21:54.680 --> 21:56.720]  Because we named a lot of different kinds of french fries.
[21:56.840 --> 21:58.860]  And we've talked about having a potato draft in the past.
[21:58.960 --> 22:00.480]  But what do you think the best fry is?
[22:00.620 --> 22:02.780]  Because we mentioned curly fries.
[22:03.360 --> 22:05.320]  We mentioned crinkle cut fries.
[22:05.480 --> 22:06.640]  We mentioned McDonald's fries.
[22:06.760 --> 22:08.060]  We mentioned potato wedges.
[22:08.500 --> 22:10.220]  What about waffle fries?
[22:10.340 --> 22:14.840]  Like, there's so many different kinds of french fries that don't have cum on them.
[22:14.840 --> 22:16.580]  What do you think is the best?
[22:16.800 --> 22:18.660]  I'd actually argue most don't.
[22:18.960 --> 22:21.280]  Um, I would say, uh, curly.
[22:21.420 --> 22:23.300]  I like a curly fry with the seasoning.
[22:23.900 --> 22:25.300]  A nice seasoned curly fry.
[22:25.800 --> 22:29.560]  I don't know, but I would say a waffle fry would be the hardest to get cum off.
[22:29.920 --> 22:31.400]  Oh, it's a lost cause.
[22:31.540 --> 22:33.300]  There's no washing the cum off that fry.
[22:33.420 --> 22:34.200]  Yeah, that's too much.
[22:36.640 --> 22:38.640]  Is this what happens when Gracie's not here?
[22:38.780 --> 22:40.840]  Like, Gracie's not here and it's just become this.
[22:41.580 --> 22:43.820]  I, listen, I'm not, I wish Gracie was here.
[22:43.820 --> 22:45.280]  I got some statements.
[22:46.740 --> 22:47.780]  Unrelated to this.
[22:48.640 --> 22:49.920]  What's your favorite french fry, Eric?
[22:50.520 --> 22:52.140]  What's your favorite cumless french fry?
[22:52.240 --> 22:56.700]  My favorite cumless french fry is, I think, just the regular long french fry.
[22:56.780 --> 22:58.060]  I'm a classic french fry guy.
[22:58.220 --> 22:59.480]  Not, not like...
[22:59.480 --> 23:00.660]  Like a long, thin french fry?
[23:00.820 --> 23:05.720]  Yeah, but I really, I'll even go like thinner, too, that I really like that.
[23:05.780 --> 23:10.540]  But, like, I think the best french fry is just the regular, what you would probably call bog standard french fry.
[23:10.540 --> 23:15.460]  Almost like the width of the, like those long skinny fries, almost like an Andy Cap fry.
[23:15.700 --> 23:18.980]  Yeah, it's like that, like a McDonald's size fry.
[23:19.200 --> 23:23.460]  But, like, I'll eat any of them, really. As long as there's no cum, I'm all the way in.
[23:23.760 --> 23:30.840]  I started to feel bad, like 80% into this conversation, that probably a lot of people are going to be eating fries while listening to this.
[23:31.600 --> 23:32.960]  I'm ordering fries right now.
[23:33.360 --> 23:37.220]  I mean, there might be a couple people coming while listening to this, too, so they could just eat up.
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.120]  I had fries for lunch today, actually, now that you mention it.
[23:41.300 --> 23:42.560]  Whataburger. They're okay.
[23:43.840 --> 23:45.340]  They're crinkle, right? Whataburger?
[23:46.380 --> 23:47.560]  Ah, they're just regular ass fries.
[23:47.820 --> 23:48.400]  Ah, just regular, okay.
[23:48.880 --> 23:55.800]  Whataburger's been, Whataburger's, I hate to say it, because I'm, I fucking love, I ride or die for Whataburger, but their quality's been all over the map the last couple years.
[23:56.040 --> 23:57.580]  I've never been fussed, never been into it.
[24:00.240 --> 24:04.220]  Well, I don't know that Whataburger 2024 is the one to get into.
[24:04.320 --> 24:06.780]  I wish I could take you back to, like, well, you were here.
[24:06.780 --> 24:08.840]  It was good. It was good back in the day.
[24:09.080 --> 24:13.180]  You're a big fan of their first menu? It just hasn't been the same since then?
[24:13.700 --> 24:17.580]  It's just, like, just the disparity in quality, and I feel like in ingredients, I notice it.
[24:17.640 --> 24:19.900]  It's the same thing as, like, there's a place here called Fly Right?
[24:20.100 --> 24:23.240]  That's like a, yeah, it's like a burger shop, but it's just chicken.
[24:23.440 --> 24:26.520]  They have, like, really, used to have really good, they had a sandwich called a cowboy.
[24:26.860 --> 24:27.380]  Cowboy's amazing.
[24:27.580 --> 24:33.000]  They changed, well, it was, they changed their ingredients about six months to a year ago, and now I can't eat there anymore.
[24:33.120 --> 24:33.860]  It's just...
[24:33.860 --> 24:34.540]  Oh, no.
[24:34.740 --> 24:35.880]  So the cowboy tastes different?
[24:35.880 --> 24:37.800]  It's so, yeah, it's, like, so noticeable.
[24:37.800 --> 24:38.360]  Yeah, I don't know what happened.
[24:38.840 --> 24:39.620]  Geoff's right, though.
[24:39.800 --> 24:40.720]  Like, the whole thing is right.
[24:40.760 --> 24:41.620]  It's such a bummer.
[24:41.780 --> 24:42.260]  It's such a bummer.
[24:42.260 --> 24:43.180]  The patty's different.
[24:43.440 --> 24:44.560]  It's, like, it's wild.
[24:44.640 --> 24:50.360]  The cowboy was the one thing that I ordered where I was okay with all the sauce that went down my wrist.
[24:50.760 --> 24:52.140]  Yeah, hot sauce, they called it.
[24:52.160 --> 24:52.880]  It was fucking good.
[24:53.320 --> 24:53.860]  I liked it, too.
[24:54.580 --> 24:56.460]  Nick says Panda Express changed their sauces.
[24:57.300 --> 24:57.560]  Yeah.
[24:58.940 --> 25:00.940]  I've never been able to eat Panda Express.
[25:01.740 --> 25:02.700]  Well, now you definitely can.
[25:05.400 --> 25:12.600]  We're starting to really dabble into Face Jam Nick territory where he has, like, some really strong takes on things that you've never thought about once in your life.
[25:12.600 --> 25:14.600]  No, this was my wife's take.
[25:14.900 --> 25:15.840]  I'm just backing her up.
[25:16.220 --> 25:17.160]  What's your French fry, Nick?
[25:17.380 --> 25:18.520]  I like a crinkle cut fry.
[25:18.780 --> 25:24.240]  Because you can get them, they ride that perfect line of crispness to softness, you know what I mean?
[25:24.460 --> 25:24.760]  Yeah.
[25:24.860 --> 25:26.740]  And if you get them just right, they're money.
[25:26.920 --> 25:27.720]  Oh, so good.
[25:28.500 --> 25:28.960]  Also ketchup.
[25:29.360 --> 25:29.640]  Hell yeah.
[25:29.640 --> 25:34.840]  Hard to beat a nice orita crinkle cut fry cooked in the oven.
[25:35.780 --> 25:36.600]  Air fryer.
[25:37.180 --> 25:38.020]  That's the best.
[25:38.060 --> 25:38.540]  Even better.
[25:38.920 --> 25:47.160]  I've been having a weird problem recently where I think I might be in Tenet, the movie, because all of my robocalls are backwards.
[25:48.440 --> 25:48.960]  What?
[25:49.460 --> 25:52.400]  It's just people speaking backwards to me down the phone.
[25:53.020 --> 25:54.340]  And I don't know what to do about it.
[25:54.640 --> 25:56.980]  Like in Twin Peaks backwards?
[25:57.720 --> 25:57.880]  Yeah.
[25:58.380 --> 25:59.940]  Yeah, I'll see you in 25 years.
[26:00.420 --> 26:02.000]  What? Can you give an example?
[26:02.700 --> 26:05.920]  Well, I don't know what they're actually saying. I've not been able to record one and play it forwards.
[26:06.680 --> 26:09.060]  The next time I get called, I'm going to have to...
[26:09.060 --> 26:10.540]  Yeah, how do I record a phone call?
[26:11.040 --> 26:13.440]  Put it on speaker and then just put it next to a microphone?
[26:14.200 --> 26:14.440]  Yeah.
[26:15.740 --> 26:17.580]  You're talking into one right now, probably.
[26:17.940 --> 26:20.440]  Yeah, I want like your Tenet phone call. I need to hear it.
[26:21.820 --> 26:23.740]  It sounds like shit and it's backwards.
[26:25.280 --> 26:26.700]  I'm desperate to hear this too.
[26:26.700 --> 26:29.400]  Yeah, what could they possibly be saying? And is it on purpose?
[26:30.220 --> 26:32.020]  Or is there tape got stuck?
[26:32.540 --> 26:35.360]  How many is this? How many are we talking about here?
[26:35.620 --> 26:40.100]  Uh, like three. But three is a lot for backwards phone calls. Backwards women talking to me.
[26:41.260 --> 26:42.020]  That is quite a few.
[26:42.020 --> 26:43.860]  And it's like...
[26:43.860 --> 26:44.360]  Yeah.
[26:47.100 --> 26:47.540]  Wow.
[26:48.520 --> 26:51.920]  And I wonder if the first thing that she says is bye.
[26:56.460 --> 26:58.200]  I mean, it would make sense.
[26:59.160 --> 27:01.720]  I want to know if anyone listening has had these.
[27:02.140 --> 27:03.360]  Because it seems to be a new thing for me.
[27:03.840 --> 27:06.680]  Is this at all connected to the prank against me, Geoff?
[27:07.220 --> 27:07.960]  Is this phase one?
[27:08.560 --> 27:11.160]  No, but this is an awesome prank if it was.
[27:12.380 --> 27:15.460]  I've been getting a different kind of call lately that I've been answering and loving.
[27:16.120 --> 27:18.440]  It's like I'm 12 years old again. I've been having so much fun.
[27:18.780 --> 27:20.420]  I've been getting sales calls for shit.
[27:20.420 --> 27:23.700]  I got a call from BMW the other day and they're like,
[27:23.780 --> 27:26.420]  Hey man, how's your BMW treating you?
[27:26.520 --> 27:28.680]  And I'm in the car with Emily and she's like,
[27:28.720 --> 27:29.540]  Why the fuck are you talking to them?
[27:29.600 --> 27:31.520]  And I'm like, it's great. What can I do for you?
[27:31.880 --> 27:34.700]  And they're like, well, you know, your car's getting a couple years old now.
[27:34.780 --> 27:36.080]  We figured you'd probably want to be ready for an upgrade.
[27:36.520 --> 27:38.200]  Why don't you swing by and check out some new models?
[27:38.300 --> 27:41.980]  We want to know when we can schedule an appointment to come show you the new M series.
[27:42.380 --> 27:46.760]  And I get to go, oh jeez, I'd love to buy a new car, but it's a real bad time.
[27:46.840 --> 27:49.820]  I just lost my job on Monday and I'm broke.
[27:49.820 --> 27:52.200]  I don't know that I'm going to be able to afford my home anymore.
[27:52.360 --> 27:54.080]  So I got a lot to figure out.
[27:54.240 --> 27:56.080]  But definitely keep me in mind.
[27:56.680 --> 27:58.320]  Call me back in a couple months and I go like,
[27:58.340 --> 27:59.700]  Oh, okay.
[27:59.860 --> 28:01.440]  And they cannot get off the phone fast.
[28:01.680 --> 28:03.340]  It's fucking awesome.
[28:04.360 --> 28:05.860]  Wait a second.
[28:06.060 --> 28:07.960]  If you're going to have watermelon and half of it come on,
[28:08.040 --> 28:08.860]  I would still have the watermelon.
[28:11.960 --> 28:14.720]  They don't usually bring up cum, but they definitely get off the phone quickly.
[28:16.440 --> 28:17.960]  That's quite the move you have.
[28:18.660 --> 28:19.820]  It's just, I don't know.
[28:20.140 --> 28:23.520]  If they're going to call me and try to sell me something, I'm going to be honest with them.
[28:23.560 --> 28:27.200]  Now have you noticed that they have stopped calling because of this?
[28:27.260 --> 28:28.460]  Has this been effective in that way?
[28:28.460 --> 28:32.040]  I've only had like three calls.
[28:32.800 --> 28:34.100]  Four maybe so far.
[28:34.440 --> 28:38.880]  One was BMW and the other three were like insurance or that kind of thing.
[28:38.940 --> 28:39.900]  What if...
[28:39.900 --> 28:41.900]  But usually I would just say no thank you and hang up.
[28:41.960 --> 28:44.020]  But now it's like, well, I got time. I don't have a job.
[28:44.380 --> 28:46.540]  Let me make this person uncomfortable for a few minutes.
[28:47.260 --> 28:51.660]  I like the idea that this goes against you and they call back again and you got to do the same bit.
[28:51.720 --> 28:53.920]  And they're like, you haven't been employed yet?
[28:54.140 --> 28:56.060]  You haven't got a job yet?
[28:56.660 --> 28:58.360]  I would roll with that person.
[28:58.520 --> 29:00.880]  If that person wants to call me back, I definitely would hold that.
[29:02.160 --> 29:02.880]  I'm shocked.
[29:04.020 --> 29:06.740]  Jesus, he's still... this guy's still not employed.
[29:08.040 --> 29:09.980]  It's like, hey, it's Tony from Insurance Warehouse.
[29:10.080 --> 29:12.300]  I just want to call and check in. Make sure you're doing okay there, Geoff.
[29:12.460 --> 29:14.860]  I know you were looking for a job about three weeks ago.
[29:14.860 --> 29:16.620]  I just wanted to see if you put any feelers out.
[29:16.740 --> 29:17.960]  Have you got any interviews?
[29:18.380 --> 29:20.320]  We're just thinking about you over here at Insurance Warehouse.
[29:20.380 --> 29:21.280]  Want to make sure you're doing okay.
[29:21.580 --> 29:23.860]  Update is filed. A hopeless Geoff.
[29:23.980 --> 29:26.000]  This guy still doesn't have a job.
[29:28.620 --> 29:29.860]  They have notes in their like...
[29:30.420 --> 29:31.040]  Repo Geoff.
[29:32.040 --> 29:32.660]  Still unemployed.
[29:36.220 --> 29:37.940]  I'm glad that that's...
[29:37.940 --> 29:41.980]  I mean, if you're going to find positives out of what happened, that's a way to do it.
[29:41.980 --> 29:45.440]  I used to have the best time when I was a little kid and I'd get those calls.
[29:45.660 --> 29:46.760]  And they'd be like, can I talk to your mother?
[29:47.220 --> 29:48.120]  And I'm like, what's this about?
[29:48.160 --> 29:50.520]  And they'd be like, oh, we want to talk to her about her insurance warranty.
[29:50.620 --> 29:52.140]  And I'd be like, it's pretty important.
[29:52.260 --> 29:53.340]  And they'd be like, yes, it's pretty important.
[29:53.400 --> 29:55.020]  I'm like, okay, I'll go try to get her.
[29:55.120 --> 29:59.840]  She's in the bathroom crying because my dad said that he wasn't going to ever come home again.
[30:00.780 --> 30:03.260]  And mom was saying something about how we can't live here now.
[30:03.360 --> 30:05.580]  But let me go and knock on the door and see if she'll talk to you.
[30:05.620 --> 30:07.400]  I'd be like, oh, it's okay. I'll call back later.
[30:10.480 --> 30:12.220]  You really have a playbook.
[30:12.420 --> 30:18.540]  You've been running the triangle defense on callers for years.
[30:18.900 --> 30:21.600]  My playbook was to tell the truth to strangers.
[30:21.600 --> 30:23.700]  Yeah, you could just lie and make shit up if you want.
[30:24.440 --> 30:29.280]  Yeah, I don't know. It's easier to just... it's a real world so much more interesting.
[30:29.480 --> 30:31.900]  I lie every time I cancel a service.
[30:32.560 --> 30:33.040]  Oh, yeah?
[30:33.040 --> 30:37.740]  Yeah, if they have to go for the last minute, the last ditch to give you a discount.
[30:38.820 --> 30:41.620]  You just say, I'm leaving the country and they just hang up.
[30:42.080 --> 30:43.780]  Oh, that's your... I have a different move.
[30:45.120 --> 30:45.840]  That's interesting.
[30:46.420 --> 30:50.500]  I always say it's too expensive just because I hope that they lower prices at some point.
[30:50.560 --> 30:54.420]  I know they won't, but that is no matter what, it could be completely irrelevant to that.
[30:54.540 --> 30:55.420]  That's what I always list.
[30:57.660 --> 31:02.600]  Try to trick them to lower the prices on a service I'm not going to use.
[31:02.600 --> 31:05.540]  I don't really know who I'm doing it for, but that is my move.
[31:05.540 --> 31:07.640]  Just cancel. What are you doing? What are you talking about?
[31:08.840 --> 31:12.280]  Gavin just said that he lies so that way they don't try to do that.
[31:12.400 --> 31:14.720]  And you went, here's my trick to get them to lower prices.
[31:15.240 --> 31:16.680]  What are you talking about?
[31:17.120 --> 31:20.020]  A lot of times they will give you a lower price for like three months or something.
[31:21.660 --> 31:24.620]  Wait, and you're not canceling or you are canceling?
[31:25.220 --> 31:25.960]  No, I'm canceling.
[31:26.380 --> 31:27.660]  Yeah, well, that's what I do.
[31:27.780 --> 31:29.980]  But I'm just trying to help the common man, I guess.
[31:30.040 --> 31:31.360]  I'm trying to get them to lower their prices.
[31:31.360 --> 31:34.880]  He's giving them feedback by saying, I'm canceling because it's too expensive.
[31:35.160 --> 31:36.500]  And they're like, what if we lower the prices?
[31:36.680 --> 31:38.820]  And he's like, it's one dollar is too expensive.
[31:39.240 --> 31:42.580]  Exactly. If they get enough of those, they might lower the prices.
[31:43.400 --> 31:46.520]  I'm not taking benefit from it, but somebody, maybe somebody will.
[31:48.260 --> 31:49.320]  You got to love low prices.
[31:49.540 --> 31:51.740]  We're unemployed, Eric. You're against low prices.
[31:52.320 --> 31:53.940]  No, I'm for low prices.
[31:54.200 --> 31:57.880]  I just don't know in my lifetime that things have ever gone down in price.
[31:58.840 --> 32:01.640]  I don't know that's a very fair argument.
[32:01.760 --> 32:04.980]  Yeah, I mean, just in general, it just doesn't, you know, I don't typically see it.
[32:05.080 --> 32:08.100]  I can't believe how much TV costs.
[32:08.580 --> 32:10.540]  Like, I don't know, YouTube TV.
[32:10.760 --> 32:12.200]  And now are we talking about actual?
[32:12.380 --> 32:14.080]  Okay, yeah, like the subscription.
[32:15.460 --> 32:17.340]  Actual TV is also still expensive.
[32:17.880 --> 32:20.400]  It's absolutely obscene in this country.
[32:20.660 --> 32:21.500]  So are phone bills.
[32:22.960 --> 32:23.780]  Oh, I'm good with that.
[32:25.280 --> 32:31.840]  So how much does TV cost in America versus a comparable package in England?
[32:32.280 --> 32:34.000]  I don't know. I never paid for anything in England.
[32:34.960 --> 32:38.560]  Well, see, you really don't know how much shit costs in England because your mom paid for it all.
[32:38.920 --> 32:40.420]  Well, we just didn't really have it.
[32:40.580 --> 32:44.200]  I think Sky is quite expensive, but I don't.
[32:44.980 --> 32:47.780]  Don't you need a TV license or something?
[32:49.040 --> 32:54.820]  Yeah, if you watch live TV, you have to pay the license and that funds the BBC.
[32:55.500 --> 32:56.640]  How much is that fee?
[32:57.440 --> 33:00.600]  I don't know. I think it's gone up quite a lot since I was living there.
[33:01.180 --> 33:03.220]  I think it's actually cheaper as well.
[33:03.280 --> 33:06.640]  I don't know if this is the same because who knows how many around.
[33:06.760 --> 33:09.400]  I think it was a cheaper license if you had a black and white TV.
[33:10.400 --> 33:10.800]  Oh.
[33:12.900 --> 33:16.380]  Is there a guy who comes to your house and looks at your TV?
[33:16.840 --> 33:23.980]  Well, I think they used to scare people by saying there was a van that would drive around and it would be able to detect if you're using the TV signal.
[33:24.980 --> 33:27.460]  A nation afraid of a person in a van?
[33:28.620 --> 33:31.460]  We had the same thing in America with stealing cable, though.
[33:32.500 --> 33:37.740]  Oh, OK. 2024. The TV license fee is to rise by £10.50.
[33:38.060 --> 33:38.400]  What?
[33:38.580 --> 33:42.840]  To £169.50. That is pretty pricey.
[33:42.920 --> 33:43.880]  A year or a month?
[33:44.000 --> 33:45.000]  That's for the year, I think.
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.480]  Oh, I mean, that's too much.
[33:48.400 --> 33:48.880]  Yeah.
[33:49.160 --> 33:51.260]  Period. Aren't there like ads on TV?
[33:52.140 --> 33:52.360]  Yeah.
[33:52.960 --> 33:53.860]  No, not on the BBC.
[33:54.440 --> 33:55.700]  All right. So, yeah.
[33:57.800 --> 34:00.560]  BBC is just like Channel 1 and 2.
[34:00.720 --> 34:01.940]  I don't know who to believe.
[34:02.820 --> 34:07.500]  People always bitch about how there's so many ads on American TV, and I guess they are.
[34:07.780 --> 34:11.520]  But we also don't have to pay to watch over-the-air television.
[34:11.520 --> 34:17.540]  Like, you're paying 150 bucks or whatever a year in England to get ad-free BBC, but you still gotta pay for BBC.
[34:17.800 --> 34:21.160]  I mean, I guess they were just doing the ad-free model before all these streaming services.
[34:21.920 --> 34:25.440]  Yeah, I just never considered that. I never thought about it that way.
[34:25.520 --> 34:28.980]  But you're paying just the same. That's really... that's interesting.
[34:29.640 --> 34:33.020]  Yeah, I don't know if you can get by without paying it.
[34:33.440 --> 34:36.820]  Like, I think technically if you don't use live TV, you don't...
[34:36.820 --> 34:38.820]  Like, if you just have Netflix, you wouldn't have to pay.
[34:38.840 --> 34:41.020]  Yeah, I just don't know how strict they are about that, though.
[34:41.780 --> 34:47.600]  There's a whole network that their whole pitch is like 10-second delayed TV.
[34:48.120 --> 34:52.540]  Just get around the fee. You're close. You're gonna be a little bit behind on the sporting event.
[34:52.860 --> 34:56.560]  You're not gonna be with everybody else, but you avoid the fee. Genius.
[35:01.520 --> 35:04.200]  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[35:05.080 --> 35:08.040]  Relationships are an incredibly complicated thing.
[35:08.240 --> 35:09.580]  They take a lot of effort.
[35:09.580 --> 35:17.500]  Not always every relationship, but to have a healthy dynamic with the people in your life.
[35:17.620 --> 35:26.860]  I have found that it has taken work in certain cases that I have gained a lot of knowledge from through therapy.
[35:27.280 --> 35:34.340]  Being able to talk to someone and just gain an awareness of things that I may not even be aware of.
[35:34.340 --> 35:39.560]  A common misconception about relationships is that they have to be easy to be right.
[35:40.020 --> 35:41.000]  That's certainly not true.
[35:41.360 --> 35:44.960]  But sometimes the best ones happen when both people put in the work to make them great.
[35:45.780 --> 35:54.100]  Therapy can be a place to work through the challenges you face in all of your relationships, whether with friends, work, your significant other, or anyone.
[35:54.740 --> 35:57.160]  Therapy is something that has changed my life.
[35:57.240 --> 36:00.480]  I would highly recommend it as a process to anyone to go through.
[36:00.480 --> 36:04.300]  I just think it's so healthy and it adds a lot.
[36:04.520 --> 36:09.220]  It has been a real impactful thing that I have experienced in my life.
[36:09.900 --> 36:12.580]  If you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.

[38:10.580 --> 38:13.680]  Hello, we are here to talk about Dragon's Dogma 2.
[38:14.260 --> 38:16.960]  In my opinion, one of the most anticipated games of the year.
[38:16.960 --> 38:18.400]  It's available now for you to get.
[38:18.840 --> 38:24.000]  It is an amazing title of third-person action.
[38:24.480 --> 38:26.040]  The combat in it is so cool.
[38:26.460 --> 38:29.680]  It also has incredibly deep customizable options.
[38:30.080 --> 38:33.920]  Which I think is so essential when you're playing an open-world game like this.
[38:34.500 --> 38:39.100]  Where you're creating a character you're going to spend countless hours with.
[38:39.420 --> 38:45.200]  Being able to make something that is a reflection of you enhances the experience so much.
[38:45.200 --> 38:47.980]  And with the level of depth of the character creator.
[38:48.420 --> 38:53.600]  You're going to be able to really shape something that you think will be awesome or silly.
[38:53.720 --> 38:55.280]  Or really whatever tone you're going for.
[38:55.480 --> 38:59.620]  I personally love to make really silly looking characters in games like this.
[38:59.920 --> 39:02.520]  But it's whatever you choose to do.
[39:02.760 --> 39:05.160]  Plus another really cool thing about Dragon's Dogma 2.
[39:05.640 --> 39:08.980]  Is that you can have pawns which are essentially like sidekicks.
[39:08.980 --> 39:15.400]  And you can join a guild and then have two additional pawns join you through that process.
[39:15.520 --> 39:16.980]  And they get uploaded online.
[39:17.080 --> 39:25.520]  So you can create a pawn and then have them be downloadable for other players to collect or pull into their own worlds.
[39:25.780 --> 39:28.720]  Which I think is such a cool way of sharing characters.
[39:28.940 --> 39:30.360]  And once again encouraging character creation.
[39:30.460 --> 39:33.720]  Which I think is such an important thing for games.
[39:33.860 --> 39:36.240]  I think character creators are so cool.
[39:37.040 --> 39:40.840]  There's so many depth of locations in Dragon's Dogma 2.
[39:41.300 --> 39:47.780]  You can choose over 10 different places for the Arisen and your main pawn to explore.
[39:48.220 --> 39:49.740]  It has a rich explorable world.
[39:49.880 --> 39:53.160]  I mean just going from point to point you're going to stumble into so many different things.
[39:53.560 --> 39:58.420]  It's really about the journey of the world in my experience so far.
[39:59.560 --> 40:02.760]  If you're excited about Dragon's Dogma 2 like I am.
[40:03.760 --> 40:05.400]  You should definitely check it out.
[40:05.400 --> 40:06.160]  It's awesome.
[40:06.520 --> 40:07.520]  It's a really cool game.
[40:07.980 --> 40:08.940]  Take on the dragon.
[40:09.380 --> 40:10.320]  Make your pawns.
[40:10.380 --> 40:11.160]  Make your characters.
[40:11.340 --> 40:13.640]  I'd love to see if you want to tweet at me or whatever.
[40:14.260 --> 40:15.120]  Whatever character you make.
[40:15.160 --> 40:16.040]  I'd love to see them.
[40:16.420 --> 40:17.560]  The combat is really in depth.
[40:17.660 --> 40:19.100]  You have so many classes to choose from.
[40:19.380 --> 40:20.800]  You can switch between them whenever you'd like.
[40:21.680 --> 40:22.880]  It's just so cool.
[40:23.100 --> 40:24.620]  Dragon's Dogma 2 is an amazing game.
[40:25.180 --> 40:25.860]  It's so much fun.
[40:26.120 --> 40:27.520]  I'd highly recommend checking it out.
[40:28.300 --> 40:30.020]  Yeah, that's about it.
[40:30.300 --> 40:30.700]  Thank you.
[40:31.140 --> 40:31.520]  Bye!
[40:34.040 --> 40:34.740]  God, man.
[40:34.880 --> 40:40.720]  We were in England during the Tyson Fury-Deontay Wilder fight.
[40:42.020 --> 40:43.100]  That's a boxing match.
[40:43.280 --> 40:45.200]  Not a big deal to you guys, but Tyson Fury is British.
[40:46.120 --> 40:47.360]  And it was a big deal.
[40:47.540 --> 40:48.520]  It was at Wembley Stadium.
[40:49.080 --> 40:51.060]  And I briefly thought, oh, maybe we'll try to go.
[40:51.220 --> 40:52.520]  But it was going to be way too expensive.
[40:52.720 --> 40:59.780]  And I didn't want to try to navigate from my hotel all the way there and back at 3pm on a Saturday on a whim.
[40:59.780 --> 41:02.300]  And so I thought, well, I'll just buy the fight.
[41:02.560 --> 41:03.960]  Emily and I can watch it in the hotel room.
[41:04.060 --> 41:11.960]  It took me about three hours to figure out how to buy a boxing match in England on British TV.
[41:12.180 --> 41:14.520]  It was so goddamn complicated.
[41:14.660 --> 41:17.160]  And I had to use two VPNs to do it.
[41:17.200 --> 41:19.780]  It was fucking insanity.
[41:20.640 --> 41:21.660]  But I did it.
[41:21.700 --> 41:23.620]  It was the hardest thing I've ever done in my entire life.
[41:23.620 --> 41:33.700]  I don't know if this is still the case, but I don't believe that there was a pay-per-view system even in London or whatever until relatively recently.
[41:34.260 --> 41:44.980]  Because in the past, if you're going to stream a UFC event or whatever, all the illegal streams were the British network's coverage of it.
[41:45.060 --> 41:47.300]  Because they were just air on Sky or whatever.
[41:47.580 --> 41:52.540]  It was part of the basic cable package because they didn't have a pay-per-view infrastructure at that time.
[41:52.540 --> 41:58.580]  I think Sky is what I eventually was able to buy it through, but it wasn't easy at all.
[41:59.200 --> 42:00.660]  It's always usually satellite TV.
[42:01.200 --> 42:02.520]  Yeah, it was really difficult.
[42:02.800 --> 42:04.860]  I don't remember. I was able to do it eventually.
[42:05.080 --> 42:07.700]  And then we were able to watch it on my iPad, but it was fucking hard.
[42:09.080 --> 42:09.700]  Which was the...
[42:10.140 --> 42:13.060]  No, of course not! It's never worth it! It's never worth it!
[42:13.100 --> 42:15.240]  Was it the second fight or the third fight?
[42:15.840 --> 42:17.140]  It was the third fight. It was the last fight.
[42:17.140 --> 42:21.880]  I was going to say, because the second fight, was that a first round or second round knockout?
[42:22.500 --> 42:30.040]  I think it was. I mean, I like both boxers, but I'm from Alabama. Deontay Wilder's from Alabama, so I always kind of had an affinity for him.
[42:30.460 --> 42:33.240]  I just wanted to see him do well in that third fight.
[42:33.860 --> 42:40.640]  What was it that you used to always have to call up for? I think it was every time you tried to watch Always Sunny or something. Something would be wrong with...
[42:40.640 --> 42:43.020]  Do you remember what you used to have to be on the phone about?
[42:43.720 --> 42:54.860]  I had to call every time any of you bought a video game on my credit card. On the company Amex.
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.480]  Was that separate to the Always Sunny thing?
[42:57.120 --> 43:06.660]  Yeah. I don't remember specifically the Always Sunny thing, but every single time you guys bought a video game on Steam, specifically.
[43:06.660 --> 43:14.040]  And any time we bought a video game, we bought it six times, right? Because there were six of us, and everything was multiplayer, and we never knew who was going to be available.
[43:14.320 --> 43:18.640]  So even if it was a four player, you had to get six, because you needed to have people to rotate in and out and shit, right?
[43:19.100 --> 43:31.360]  And so every time you guys would buy a game, it would lock my credit card, and I'd have to call American Express and go through six or seven minutes of the most inane and frustrating conversation.
[43:31.360 --> 43:43.360]  Where I would literally go, okay, listen. I'm about to buy this video game again. In five minutes. It's not... don't lock my card. I'm telling you in advance I'm going to buy it.
[43:43.400 --> 43:47.420]  And they're like, okay, got it. No problem. Can I stay on the phone with you while I buy it?
[43:47.560 --> 43:55.040]  And they'd be like, no sir, we're not allowed to stay on the phone while you're making purchases, but we've got a note... I made a note in your account, so you should be good to go.
[43:55.040 --> 44:02.880]  And I go, okay, cool. Buy it. Locked. Call him up. You lied to me! And they'd be like, oh, I'm sorry, I can't get you to that agent, but I'm happy to unlock the card for you.
[44:02.980 --> 44:06.040]  And you just do that all day long, every day, for like seven years.
[44:06.720 --> 44:14.360]  You guys hear? Hopeless Geoff is about to buy six Steam games. Call him back each time. We can't trust this.
[44:14.820 --> 44:15.860]  Man's about to lose his card.
[44:16.260 --> 44:19.120]  God. It was fucking brutal. I hated it so much.
[44:19.520 --> 44:23.240]  You could have just not... oh, I guess if you didn't answer... yeah, you had... yeah. No, you're fucked.
[44:23.240 --> 44:38.720]  I never once won in that situation. Like, it never worked. I never got the note to... it never worked the second time. It was 100% failure 100% of the time we tried to do it.
[44:38.980 --> 44:41.760]  Over and over and over and over again for so many years.
[44:42.980 --> 44:43.700]  That's incredible.
[44:45.220 --> 44:46.240]  I would...
[44:46.240 --> 44:48.400]  Gavin got me all sad thinking about that.
[44:48.840 --> 44:49.360]  Sorry.
[44:50.260 --> 44:55.180]  That was the bane. It was the bane of my existence for a while.
[44:55.340 --> 44:58.400]  I would get so mad and I would just start screaming at people.
[44:58.680 --> 45:04.280]  And I'd turn around and there'd be three people from Achievement Hunter filming me on their phones laughing.
[45:04.580 --> 45:07.080]  And it was always like a thing. It used to drive me nuts.
[45:08.180 --> 45:11.460]  We're not even going to make a video in this game. This is the video.
[45:11.860 --> 45:12.200]  Oh, yeah.
[45:12.560 --> 45:13.540]  We're not even playing this.
[45:15.320 --> 45:18.540]  I had a business idea. I had a realization.
[45:19.300 --> 45:22.280]  I'm not going to claim that it is as good as Thank Me Later.
[45:23.160 --> 45:29.540]  But I realized I was in a line for drive-thru at a McDonald's.
[45:30.400 --> 45:36.760]  And that the notion of McDonald's being fast food or just fast food in general...
[45:36.760 --> 45:41.720]  I feel like we're really not emphasizing on the fast of the fast food anymore.
[45:41.720 --> 45:42.940]  Things are slower.
[45:43.380 --> 45:46.820]  So I had this thought. You guys can hear me out if you think this is a good idea or not.
[45:47.700 --> 45:50.580]  A food truck that never stops moving.
[45:50.940 --> 45:53.680]  And you order... you're always in motion.
[45:53.920 --> 45:57.840]  And you have to try to make the orders at stoplights and then go.
[45:58.460 --> 46:01.140]  So it has to be quick. I'm thinking like a burger truck or that type of thing.
[46:01.220 --> 46:03.800]  Just something that would keep fast food fast.
[46:03.860 --> 46:05.600]  Because I don't think fast food is fast anymore.
[46:06.100 --> 46:07.960]  I'd argue it's relatively slow.
[46:07.960 --> 46:10.660]  What if it wasn't... you didn't have to catch up with it on the road.
[46:10.760 --> 46:15.320]  But it moved as fast as your car moves through a drive-thru.
[46:16.200 --> 46:17.620]  But for you on foot.
[46:18.480 --> 46:19.440]  Yeah. Interesting.
[46:20.140 --> 46:23.220]  Instead of you moving through, it would just move past you.
[46:23.300 --> 46:25.340]  And you would do all the transaction as it moves.
[46:26.480 --> 46:27.980]  That's a fascinating idea.
[46:28.280 --> 46:31.940]  Kind of like those Japanese super trains that never stop moving.
[46:32.220 --> 46:36.000]  And then you get on the platform and the platform starts to move to catch up to the train.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.600]  You know where that would be?
[46:39.640 --> 46:40.440]  That's a better idea.
[46:41.120 --> 46:42.920]  A great place to implement that, Andrew.
[46:43.180 --> 46:45.120]  Would be in gridlock.
[46:45.700 --> 46:46.300]  Oh, yeah.
[46:46.300 --> 46:51.300]  You're just crawling along and then suddenly Jack in the Box is crawling up next to you.
[46:51.300 --> 46:53.020]  Going, hey man, you want a jumbo jack?
[46:53.240 --> 46:55.480]  And you could just fucking... that would be... that's brilliant.
[46:56.260 --> 47:04.240]  I bet in future they could have a McDonald's van that would show up on your car's dash in some way.
[47:04.240 --> 47:09.900]  If it's within half a mile and it's coming your way, you could just place the order and it would throw it through your window.
[47:10.840 --> 47:15.240]  That was part of my thought was then like how fast...
[47:15.980 --> 47:17.720]  For how physics work, right?
[47:17.800 --> 47:22.100]  You'd have to throw at the same speed you were moving for it to cross.
[47:22.800 --> 47:23.820]  Is that correct?
[47:24.500 --> 47:24.620]  Yeah.
[47:25.920 --> 47:28.900]  Well, then just say no.
[47:30.680 --> 47:32.340]  What part was right?
[47:32.340 --> 47:37.740]  It would be moving at the same speed as your car and their car, but you wouldn't have to throw it at that speed.
[47:38.500 --> 47:42.760]  I thought that if you threw at a lesser... Oh, I guess it would be moving...
[47:42.760 --> 47:49.580]  Like if I'm going 70 and you're going 70 and you throw it at 70 into my face, I'm gonna die.
[47:51.320 --> 47:56.620]  Yeah, well, maybe not. It could be a potato bun. It could be a soft fluffy bun.
[47:56.800 --> 48:00.620]  A bun hitting me in the face at 70 miles an hour is gonna leave a pretty big dent.
[48:00.620 --> 48:06.300]  No, you're ridiculous. You think a potato bun at 70 miles per hour is gonna do damage to you?
[48:06.380 --> 48:11.440]  I think a potato bun would, but what about a Parker House roll or something softer, maybe? Like a Hawaiian roll.
[48:11.440 --> 48:20.560]  So you're saying I could make like a little PVC pipe, pressurize it to the right PSI that it'll come out at 70 miles an hour and you'd let me shoot it into your face?
[48:20.980 --> 48:22.420]  Yeah, I would.
[48:23.560 --> 48:30.240]  That's... I mean, well, think about that. That's about as fast as I can throw a baseball. Would you want to be hit by me throwing a 70 mile an hour?
[48:30.240 --> 48:35.640]  No, a baseball's hard. I'm talking a soft, fluffy bun. Like a marshmallow. I'd take a marshmallow and eat it.
[48:35.640 --> 48:38.660]  Do you think if you tried to catch it in your mouth, it would knock your teeth out?
[48:39.100 --> 48:45.420]  First of all, we're not doing that. As someone... we're at Root Canal Solidarity, Geoff. We're not... you don't do that.
[48:45.960 --> 48:51.240]  The teeth are like the number one weak point at this point for me. I'm not dealing with that.
[48:52.500 --> 48:58.460]  Ever since that tooth popped off and I... and I just easily got it put back on. Like it was no big deal, no pain, no nothing.
[48:59.260 --> 49:04.980]  But ever since that day, every time I eat, I just... all I can think about is my teeth falling out while I'm eating.
[49:05.140 --> 49:06.600]  And it just makes me not want to eat food anymore.
[49:07.280 --> 49:09.060]  It should make you not want to eat candy anymore.
[49:09.620 --> 49:11.620]  I don't! I have it! I can't! I'm scared of it!
[49:12.460 --> 49:13.300]  Food is fine.
[49:14.160 --> 49:15.600]  No, I'm scared of it! Fuck!
[49:15.960 --> 49:16.580]  Food is good.
[49:17.760 --> 49:22.300]  This is a good point. I don't think you've ever lost it to like general food. It's been candy, right? Both times?
[49:22.820 --> 49:25.260]  Mike and Ike and salt water taffy.
[49:25.400 --> 49:27.300]  No one ever loses a tooth to mashed potato.
[49:28.840 --> 49:33.780]  Maybe that's why... well, apparently I got a lot of hot dogs in my future, so hopefully...
[49:33.780 --> 49:36.240]  Mike and Ike sounds like a depression era boxer.
[49:36.600 --> 49:37.980]  You lost your tooth to Mike and Ike.
[49:39.180 --> 49:40.500]  Heavyweight champ of the world.
[49:40.920 --> 49:45.060]  It wasn't even good, Mike and Ike. It was like a fucking like flavors of the world.
[49:46.280 --> 49:48.080]  Yeah, it was weird. Weird combinations.
[49:49.080 --> 49:51.000]  So Andrew, how fast would you throw the food?
[49:52.100 --> 49:53.700]  I don't know how fast I could throw it.
[49:53.700 --> 49:57.220]  I just thought that I had to throw it at the speed, which would then make it more complicated.
[49:57.840 --> 50:02.060]  I mean, if you were still and the car was 70, then you would have to throw it at 70.
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.440]  Oh yeah, it's not getting to that car.
[50:07.020 --> 50:11.700]  I'd have to angle it really far ahead, and even then I don't trust it. I don't think I'd make it.
[50:11.920 --> 50:14.700]  I thought that I had to throw it, because I thought it would just zip out.
[50:15.220 --> 50:17.520]  You know like when a guy gets sucked out of a plane in a movie?
[50:17.640 --> 50:20.320]  I assume that that's what would happen when I threw the burger out.
[50:20.760 --> 50:24.900]  Unless it was the same speed, it would immediately just go whoosh.
[50:25.200 --> 50:29.280]  I mean, it would if you threw the burger out of the hole of a plane while it's moving.
[50:29.460 --> 50:33.220]  Yeah, or if there was like a big gap between the cars.
[50:33.960 --> 50:37.400]  If you're throwing from one car to another, there'll be a lot of wind resistance going the other way.
[50:38.100 --> 50:41.580]  Yeah, it'd be like four feet is what I... I don't know. Three feet?
[50:42.380 --> 50:45.840]  How far apart would you say cars are when they're driving? You'd be pretty close.
[50:46.500 --> 50:49.640]  Pretty close. You can touch another car from your car pretty easily.
[50:49.640 --> 50:53.600]  Yeah, Gavin and I used to play this game called car touching.
[50:54.260 --> 50:57.160]  Traffic touching. And I didn't ever play, but I did film it.
[51:00.780 --> 51:05.280]  I've spent most of my life in this country trying not to draw attention or cause a fuss.
[51:07.360 --> 51:09.360]  You picked the wrong guy to live with, Virginia.
[51:09.480 --> 51:10.260]  Yeah, boy, did I.
[51:13.160 --> 51:17.240]  You were saying that fast food's not fast in Canada anymore.
[51:17.240 --> 51:21.020]  Do you guys have the thing in Canada? I assume they do this all over now.
[51:21.700 --> 51:23.360]  It's like a post-pandemic thing.
[51:23.900 --> 51:27.740]  But do you have the thing where you go to a McDonald's and you literally go up to them and you go,
[51:27.800 --> 51:31.940]  I'd like a number one, and they go, alright, that'd be $9 or whatever because shit's expensive now.
[51:32.080 --> 51:35.640]  And you spin around and you go to the first window and you give them your credit card
[51:35.640 --> 51:38.420]  and then they ask if you want a receipt and you go, absolutely not, and they go, no problem.
[51:38.720 --> 51:42.080]  And then you drive up to the second window and then they hand you a soda and they go,
[51:42.080 --> 51:47.840]  please pull into space number 14, we'll bring your food out to you eventually.
[51:48.140 --> 51:51.340]  And you're like, it was just one hamburger and one fry.
[51:51.880 --> 51:56.180]  Like the main thing you guys make, it's a number one, it's a Big Mac, like you should have 80 of them.
[51:56.500 --> 52:00.420]  And you're like, really? And they're like, yeah, you gotta go fuckin' sit over there for a while.
[52:00.500 --> 52:06.500]  And you go, I guess. And then you go sit there for 1 to 13 minutes while you wait to get your food.
[52:07.640 --> 52:08.120]  Do they do that?
[52:08.380 --> 52:10.460]  Yeah, I consistently get that with nuggets.
[52:11.900 --> 52:14.540]  Would it have been fresher if they had handed it to me at the window?
[52:15.160 --> 52:18.480]  Nah, it would have been sat there right next to them for like, nah, I don't buy that.
[52:18.840 --> 52:21.280]  I've definitely gotten hot food and not waited.
[52:22.360 --> 52:23.960]  It's for me, I always blame nuggets.
[52:24.360 --> 52:25.500]  Well, hot doesn't mean fresh.
[52:26.140 --> 52:29.620]  I've also gotten not hot and not fresh food and waited.
[52:29.800 --> 52:31.520]  Like, I don't think it has anything to do...
[52:31.520 --> 52:36.340]  I think that having you drive up to a parking spot has something to do with the timing
[52:36.340 --> 52:42.900]  that they have to turn and burn and that probably corporate has them clocking how long it takes them per average customer
[52:42.900 --> 52:45.360]  and they're trying to stay under some sort of a threshold.
[52:45.500 --> 52:49.620]  But I don't think it affects how fresh your food is at all, personally.
[52:49.880 --> 52:53.040]  Yeah, I don't know. But yeah, I've definitely experienced that. It is annoying.
[52:53.520 --> 52:57.000]  We were gonna do that hot dog gun over the building, weren't we?
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.960]  I was thinking that. I was literally about to bring that up.
[53:01.080 --> 53:08.040]  I don't know if it actually... I was gonna say it's sadder. It might be funnier that it's no longer the offices anymore.
[53:08.280 --> 53:09.080]  It's just a building.
[53:09.680 --> 53:11.120]  Doesn't mean we can't still do it.
[53:11.520 --> 53:15.380]  Yeah, I know. That's what I'm saying. Like, I think it's actually funnier that it's not associated.
[53:16.320 --> 53:17.960]  We have no business being there anymore.
[53:19.080 --> 53:21.280]  You know what'd be fun is we do it.
[53:21.680 --> 53:25.320]  All right, we show up and we do it. We got it. We definitely have to do this.
[53:25.320 --> 53:30.300]  But then once we've established that it's doable, then we have to find bigger buildings to do it.
[53:30.340 --> 53:33.440]  And we just have to see how tall of a building we can shoot a hot dog over.
[53:34.220 --> 53:39.660]  Okay, what about this, Geoff? Think about this. Hypothetic for you. Little thing to ponder.
[53:40.260 --> 53:47.060]  The hot dog has come on it before it flies out of the tube and it all launches off in the air.
[53:47.900 --> 53:49.540]  Do you eat the dog?
[53:50.940 --> 53:53.600]  I mean, that depends on how windy it is, I guess.
[53:55.080 --> 53:59.400]  What if we modify it, too? Like, what if we find a building that's seven or eight stories tall?
[53:59.680 --> 54:03.420]  I could go up to like the sixth story, stick my head out a window and see if you can hit me.
[54:07.280 --> 54:08.380]  What a way to die.
[54:10.160 --> 54:14.000]  Here's another fantastic business idea for Andrew.
[54:14.440 --> 54:18.740]  You're delivering food to people in cars while they're moving. Fast food.
[54:19.860 --> 54:22.420]  It's the next evolution from Uber Eats.
[54:22.420 --> 54:26.940]  Instead of buzzing somebody up to your fucking floor so they can leave the food in front of your apartment door,
[54:27.260 --> 54:31.900]  you just open your window and they shoot it via pneumatic gun right into your hands or mouth.
[54:33.680 --> 54:36.580]  I definitely prefer hands, I think, than mouth.
[54:37.580 --> 54:38.520]  Yeah, you got the choice.
[54:38.920 --> 54:42.520]  Yeah, I guess choice is never an issue. You want choice.
[54:43.560 --> 54:45.580]  What is the photo that Eric just sent?
[54:45.600 --> 54:46.540]  Did that woman get glanced?
[54:46.800 --> 54:51.280]  Oh, she got T-shirt cannoned, I'm assuming, out of a hot dog gun.
[54:51.280 --> 54:56.180]  Hot dog the Philly's fanatic shot a woman in the face with a hot dog cannon.
[54:56.400 --> 55:01.980]  It launches a hot dog out of the hot dog cannon and she got hit with it.
[55:02.360 --> 55:06.480]  Now, see, the mistake she made was she tried to catch it with her right eye.
[55:06.620 --> 55:08.600]  She should have used her hands or her mouth.
[55:08.880 --> 55:13.580]  She had shoulder surgery and could not move her right arm to block it.
[55:14.420 --> 55:15.300]  Oh, dear.
[55:15.600 --> 55:18.620]  Any other thoughts, Geoff? Anything else you want to slander this woman with?
[55:18.820 --> 55:18.960]  Just carry on.
[55:18.960 --> 55:19.700]  What was that left arm?
[55:19.700 --> 55:26.540]  Well, I don't think I'm slandering her, but if you have shoulder surgery, maybe don't order Uber Eats now to your window.
[55:29.160 --> 55:38.300]  I feel like there should be a service that's very similar to a sushi conveyor belt, except above your town would be balloons holding food.
[55:39.100 --> 55:42.740]  And there'd be little blimps. There'd be a little QR code on the blimp.
[55:43.340 --> 55:48.440]  You scan it, you find out what food it's got, and if you want it, you pay for it, and it pops and it drops you your food.
[55:48.960 --> 55:53.720]  What if you do it more like Animal Crossing and you just have to shoot the food down?
[55:53.720 --> 55:55.800]  Yeah, you gotta shoot it down. 100%.
[55:55.800 --> 55:58.740]  That could work. I don't know how you'd pay for it.
[56:00.280 --> 56:03.080]  I don't know. Honor system, you scan the QR code with whatever hits the ground.
[56:03.420 --> 56:07.320]  Let me introduce you to Amazon bullets. They scan as they pop.
[56:08.680 --> 56:12.160]  And you get charged based off of a weapon. I don't know.
[56:12.940 --> 56:19.180]  The issue mainly, Gavin, is birds, I feel like, with your system. There's gonna be a lot of fucking fed birds.
[56:20.100 --> 56:21.740]  I don't think birds like balloons, though.
[56:22.420 --> 56:25.280]  Do you think birds would land on balloon food?
[56:25.480 --> 56:26.580]  It'd be enclosed.
[56:27.660 --> 56:31.320]  Oh, see, I was just imagining a hot dog on a string.
[56:31.580 --> 56:33.600]  Just like a bowl of spaghetti on a balloon.
[56:33.600 --> 56:37.300]  Yeah, just a bowl of spaghetti. That's what I was picturing.
[56:37.600 --> 56:39.540]  And a bird isn't gonna go to that?
[56:40.280 --> 56:42.080]  The bird doesn't like spaghetti?
[56:42.940 --> 56:44.060]  The bird loves spaghetti.
[56:44.400 --> 56:46.660]  Are you kidding me? This is an Italian bird.
[56:46.940 --> 56:50.920]  He didn't expect to find food of this kind when he immigrated.
[56:51.700 --> 56:53.640]  I was gonna say immigrated. That's not the word.
[56:54.060 --> 56:54.500]  Migrated.
[56:55.760 --> 56:57.100]  Sort of like immigrating.
[56:57.460 --> 56:59.360]  They both could. Depends on... yeah.
[57:00.480 --> 57:04.060]  Did the bird move his family to a different country? From Italy?
[57:04.060 --> 57:08.120]  The bird keeps in touch with his nephew via Skype.
[57:08.280 --> 57:10.160]  And they made a whole commercial about it.
[57:10.480 --> 57:11.300]  And it's very touching.
[57:11.980 --> 57:12.660]  That's a throwback.
[57:17.300 --> 57:18.860]  How's it going, granddad?
[57:23.740 --> 57:25.700]  That's just ruffling of a bag.
[57:26.220 --> 57:29.280]  Nice reference to a 2005 Skype commercial.
[57:29.760 --> 57:30.840]  How old were you?
[57:30.860 --> 57:32.320]  Oh, I like to keep my references timely.
[57:32.320 --> 57:33.580]  I was 11.
[57:34.100 --> 57:36.280]  How old was the person in the commercial?
[57:36.280 --> 57:37.880]  Why would you be asked how old you were?
[57:39.680 --> 57:41.800]  I heard a question. It wasn't named at anyone.
[57:42.140 --> 57:44.560]  Hey, how old were you when you watched that commercial?
[57:45.260 --> 57:47.440]  Oh, I was 28, I think.
[57:47.520 --> 57:49.940]  I believe that was last year. Maybe two years ago.
[57:50.320 --> 57:51.260]  How old were you, Gavin?
[57:51.480 --> 57:51.900]  17?
[57:52.400 --> 57:56.500]  It's like when in our text conversation yesterday,
[57:56.940 --> 57:58.560]  Eric asked Andrew how he was doing,
[57:58.720 --> 58:00.020]  and Gavin goes, I'm feeling pretty good.
[58:00.020 --> 58:01.540]  Gavin was just annoying.
[58:02.120 --> 58:03.960]  Yeah, I'm doing fine. Oh, cool.
[58:04.320 --> 58:06.940]  I mean, that's good. I'm happy to hear that.
[58:08.260 --> 58:10.300]  I'd already come out of the text conversation,
[58:10.520 --> 58:12.300]  so I was just replying to the notification.
[58:12.600 --> 58:16.540]  You know when you can just drag the thing that pops at the top of your screen?
[58:16.760 --> 58:18.780]  And then I went back in, and I was like, oh, that wasn't to me.
[58:20.640 --> 58:22.880]  I appreciated knowing how you were, though. I thought that was nice.
[58:23.080 --> 58:25.820]  I mean, I guess it was like a question for the room, so I guess that's nice.
[58:29.540 --> 58:31.180]  I'm just being chatty.
[58:31.380 --> 58:32.660]  I appreciate it.
[58:33.520 --> 58:37.880]  We're close to wrapping up, so just before whatever the next topic is,
[58:38.240 --> 58:43.960]  I just want to say that our last merch drop for F*** Face is this Friday the 29th at 10am.
[58:44.280 --> 58:46.080]  It's our final one on the 29th.
[58:46.680 --> 58:49.440]  So a couple days after you hear this, that's happening.
[58:49.680 --> 58:52.320]  It's the cookbook, it's the Sloppy Joe's jersey,
[58:53.040 --> 58:55.800]  it's the F*** Face hat, and it's our foam fingers.
[58:55.800 --> 58:59.400]  So, last chance for romance. Get the F*** Face stuff.
[58:59.960 --> 59:04.860]  Can I ask a question that might sound annoying, and I don't mean it to be,
[59:04.960 --> 59:09.280]  and you may not have the answer to this, but I'm genuinely curious.
[59:09.520 --> 59:13.340]  Is this stuff going to launch at full price and then be reduced to a dollar a day later?
[59:13.600 --> 59:17.940]  Hey, so, Andrew already worked on this with the merch team.
[59:18.360 --> 59:25.420]  We've lowered the prices to the lowest possible, almost to the factory cost of this stuff.
[59:25.420 --> 59:33.980]  So, it's not a dollar, but the MSRP on this stuff is a lot lower than you would have seen.
[59:34.120 --> 59:35.220]  Like, there's no margin on it.
[59:36.560 --> 59:40.360]  So they're not trying to make money off this, they're just trying to get Warner Brothers.
[59:40.460 --> 59:42.000]  They're just trying to reduce inventory.
[59:42.340 --> 59:45.140]  Yeah, because it's already stuff that we made.
[59:45.480 --> 59:49.940]  This is stuff that we have, and it was on its way to getting shipped and created and everything.
[59:50.340 --> 59:52.200]  So, this is the last drop, ever.
[59:52.200 --> 59:57.620]  That's great, I just didn't want to unintentionally screw over a lot of people who went to the effort to buy it.
[59:57.960 --> 59:59.000]  No, I mean...
[59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.100]  Deeply, deeply discounted.
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:03.920]  I will say, I don't anticipate this stuff being around for very long.
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:10.040]  You know, we're making the cookbook, and we're making the jersey, and it's the reproduction of the f*** face hat and everything.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.680]  I just, I don't think it's going to stick around for very long, so grab it.
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:17.780]  Do you know what's not going to come out now?
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:25.660]  Unfortunately, that we, and by we, I mean mostly Tony, but everybody, and Andrew, everybody put a fair amount of work into it, but nobody compared to Tony.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.940]  But we were in the middle of putting out, of making those trading cards.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:31.520]  What?
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.080]  No, just kidding.
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:38.060]  I don't see any way where those are actually going to come out now, unfortunately.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.460]  Can we talk about a couple of things?
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.220]  A couple of things that we were in the process of making that I'm really bummed.
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:48.640]  We were going to do more Gerplers, and I mean, that's always like a lot of fun and everything.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:55.780]  But the stuff that had been worked on by the merch team was the backpack shirt and hoodie.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:56.720]  Oh, we're losing backpack?
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.440]  I mean, we just, we aren't going to be able to make it.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.340]  I'm going to drop a couple of photos because I want to remember to post these.
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:10.700]  So Ari on the merch team put it together and I had Kat model it.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:16.840]  And the photo, like, they're so, they look, this looks insane.
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:20.480]  The backpack hoodie is so fucking crazy.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.340]  It's so crazy. I'm so bummed we can't make it.
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:27.900]  I like the little strings even on the back of the backpack.
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:32.700]  So they had to figure out how the strings would go through.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:40.040]  So they punched holes so you could have the strings go forward through both hoods and backwards through both hoods.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.580]  It was great. It was genius.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:47.120]  I'm so bummed we aren't making that because we don't have jobs.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:53.740]  Well, hopefully we'll, who knows what the future holds someday in the distant future holds.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:58.940]  Speaking of merch that I was way more excited about than I was when I looked at the pictures.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:03.720]  The little fricking shoulder falcon is so cool. I just got mine.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:09.860]  It's amazing. And I invented a new game. It's called pin the falcon on the dick.
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:10.900]  Jesus Christ.
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:16.820]  Where you put the magnet next to your penis and then you have people try and throw the falcon.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:22.860]  And man, is it satisfying when it lands. I wonder how far apart we could get.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.880]  We gotta film that, right?
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:29.780]  Yeah, I think so. Everyone puts the magnet in their pants and then we just have like a falcon war.
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.060]  100%.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:33.740]  Who, uh...
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.220]  We put a magnet in a hot dog?
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.080]  Can we do that as well?
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.140]  That seems dangerous.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:43.780]  Oh, dude, that's smart though. You can put it and then tie it to a string and then you eat the hot dog.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.860]  And then you can pull it back out and then eat it again.
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:47.940]  And you'd have one hot dog forever.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:54.800]  How many episodes of F*** Face do we have left? Do we know?
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:01.340]  Uh, we should talk about it. It's something that we needed to talk about. I mean, are we going up until the very last day?
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.380]  Is this the 27th episode?
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:09.120]  Yes, that is correct. So it'll be like another month's worth in like two weeks.
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:15.300]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... I'm looking at 6, not including this one.
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:16.560]  Yeah.
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.100]  So, 6 more after this if we're going all the way up.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.460]  So the 8th of May is the final F*** Face.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.640]  I believe so.
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:26.960]  Man, that's sad to say out loud.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:27.740]  Yep.
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.820]  Well, you know, never say never, but...
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:35.260]  It's not the final...
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:39.140]  Never say never, but yeah, I mean, yeah, that's it.
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:44.040]  No, I mean, I guess technically you're right, but like we'll do something like there'll be something next.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:48.600]  It may not be called F*** Face, but it'll be this or it will be called F*** Face and it'll be this.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.460]  We just don't know.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.420]  But it'll be something.
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:54.940]  Oh, it'll be something. I'm not saying it'll be nothing. Never say nothing.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:58.880]  There's gotta be something.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.860]  What's gonna come out on the 15th? Something.
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:11.280]  I thought of you, Gavin, the other night. I was eating a piece of pizza and I almost choked to death.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:15.200]  Like it was the closest I've gotten to choking on food.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.640]  And I don't know the Heinlich, so I almost certainly would die.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.060]  And I thought as soon as it happened, the first thing that popped in my head is I'm in a different dimension.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.880]  I definitely just died. I'm in a different dimension now.
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.380]  I've transferred over.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:32.300]  And did your life get shittier afterwards?
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:39.340]  I got sick shortly after, so yeah, I think you might be right. You might have figured this out.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.680]  You transitioned into the universe where you didn't choke to death.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.400]  Oh, man.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:51.880]  That's apparently a thing. That's apparently like a... people are saying it's called quantum immortality or something. Like a popular theory. I didn't realize.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.600]  Yeah, you're not so special. Other people thought of it first.
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:57.560]  I didn't think I was special. I did think I came up with it, though.
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:04.660]  Yeah, well, I thought I invented machinima. Turns out I didn't. Turns out I didn't even come close.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:06.760]  We invented cum dogs, though, didn't we?
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:08.940]  No, I mean...
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:12.460]  You know, I would Google and look it up. I don't want to Google it to look it up.
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.280]  I'll do it. I'm not scared of dicks.
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:16.480]  No pictures, please.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.940]  I really... Gavin's immortality theory.
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:22.600]  I shouldn't have looked it up. I shouldn't have looked it up.
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:23.060]  Yeah, no, that's right.
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.500]  Well, not with that phrasing.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.460]  I shouldn't have.
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:37.900]  Eric, what if there was a hot dog sausage, like the actual meat, and it had string tied around it, and on the other end of the string, it was tied around my penis?
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:42.340]  Now, it's not touching my penis, but would you eat the dog there?
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:45.080]  No, because hot dog wasn't my food.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.660]  How long is the string?
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:47.640]  No, I wouldn't eat the hot dog.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.660]  Okay, it's a combo strike.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:58.880]  Geoff, hang on. Geoff, unprompted, is asking the length of the string. The question wasn't for him, but he heard there's a hot dog.
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:02.240]  It's a three inch of string. That's not enough string.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.200]  Three inches of clearance?
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:09.780]  I don't want to be three inches from your open dick.
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.300]  My dick's not open.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.860]  So, wait, is this... are we talking about a lady in the tramp style thing?
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:17.160]  Oh, like the string is just coming out of your pants?
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:22.740]  Yeah, it could be coming out of my flies, but it is tied around the neck of my penis.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.020]  But I got three inches outside of the pants.
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.200]  You got three inches total on the string.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.500]  It sounds like you.
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.700]  Uh, yeah, I guess I might do it.
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.780]  Alright, and Eric, now it's a fry.
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.520]  Yeah, if it's just three or fly, sure.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.540]  So you'd eat fly fry?
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:40.860]  Absolutely.
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:41.540]  Alright.
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.220]  It'd have to be a curly fry.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.340]  I'm not a pig.
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:51.740]  Again, Andrew, unprompted, not asked, is putting this together so he can do it.
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:55.120]  I'm thinking about the logistics of the fry being on your dick.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.640]  It would have to be a curly fry.
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:57.400]  Why?
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.140]  The hole.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.500]  It's not wrapped around my...
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.880]  Do you think that it's wrapped?
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:05.720]  Like it's spiraled around his dick? Is that what you're picturing?
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.000]  That's what I assume, yeah. I thought we were going the full dick here.
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:11.040]  Are you going to have a steak?
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.320]  I mean, nobody... I mean, just to be clear, that's not what we were talking about, right?
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.480]  And he knows that.
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:29.180]  I thought we were talking about like a lady in the tramp situation, but it's a dick on the other side, and what's the distance before you cut it off? You play chicken with it.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.700]  Where would the string come into it?
[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.600]  I don't know. You know, I'm sick.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:40.100]  I think he decided it's a lady in the tramp situation and then stopped.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:40.920]  Yeah.
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:45.000]  He's the first guest guy, and that was what he guessed at.
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:50.040]  But both the lady and the tramp have been painted with the faces of children.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.140]  Oh God. No, we can't continue. What are you doing?
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:04.460]  So is the food you can't say no to, like for me it's the hot dog, for Eric it's the french fry, also the same food that you would eat the closest to a cock?
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:10.160]  I feel like my answer might be different if it was just like purely eating food close to dicks.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.140]  Like I might not want a hot dog.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:21.000]  It's a little fat, hot dog, banana, maybe I'd want something round.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:21.800]  Whoopsie.
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.460]  There it is.
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:33.840]  What if, Geoff, there's ten hot dogs on the table and they're drowned in ketchup and mustard to the point where you can't see the dog.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:39.060]  And obviously one of them is a penis, but you don't know which.
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.180]  Are you bobbing for dogs?
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:45.180]  Would you go in and just bite one of the dogs and just hope you got a dog?
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:48.200]  I mean, you better hope I get a dog, because otherwise...
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:50.080]  It's not my dick.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.340]  Oh, whose dick is it?
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:53.640]  It's Nick's dick.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.240]  Why's it gotta be Nick's dick?
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:58.220]  Because he's the condiment guy.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.480]  No, yeah, yeah, I guess that makes sense.
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:07.360]  No, I don't think I would because, A, I don't like that much condiment on my hot dog, that's all.
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:11.800]  Enough ketchup and mustard to cover it, so I couldn't tell if it was a hot dog or a cock.
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.060]  Yeah, I don't think I would eat a hot dog that slathered in sauce.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.720]  I'm not a big sauce guy, I'm not Nick.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:17.800]  Okay.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.620]  I'd be able to tell. Less is more for me.
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:26.180]  Oh, Mr. Not-a-big-sauce-guy-dies-on-condiment-hill. How fascinating.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:32.160]  I wouldn't say I died on the hill, I would say I fucking reigned supreme on it, if I'm technically correct.
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:33.120]  He yelled from the hill.
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:34.120]  He did.
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:38.700]  All right, we should wrap this one up, we only got six minutes.
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:42.040]  What an episode! What a great show!
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:44.220]  Enthusiasm all the way to the end, I love it.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:46.480]  Yeah, amazing.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:50.700]  By the way, Gavin, would you?
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.000]  I've got a 90% chance of not biting a penis.
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.800]  Yeah, I probably would, I'd roll the dice on that.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.880]  You'd roll the dice? What's the least number of hot dogs you'd roll the dice on?
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:04.080]  If I took one away and it was nine hot dogs, would you still try it?
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.120]  Oh, you would take away a dog instead of adding a second dick?
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.420]  Yeah, like I just take away dogs.
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.700]  Do you do it at eight?
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:15.280]  I'd probably go no lower than seven. Seven's my dog number.
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:18.840]  So you've got a one in seven chance of eating a dick.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.980]  Yeah, which is slightly more than the roll of a dice.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.700]  Yeah, those are pretty good odds.
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:29.580]  If it wasn't all gross and covered in...
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:38.780]  If I couldn't tell if it was a dick or a hot dog, but I also didn't have to eat too much ketchup and mustard, I'd probably try those odds. That's not bad.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.500]  And then what's the worst thing that happens?
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:46.680]  The worst thing that happens is you have a dick in your mouth for three seconds, and then you're just the guy who had a dick in his mouth for three seconds for the rest of your life.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:50.860]  You've got that out of the way. That's a joke people get to make at your expense forever.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:55.120]  And then you can just enjoy phallic shit again, I guess, after that, probably.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.400]  I mean, do you have a dice nearby?
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:58.420]  What scenario is this?
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.020]  I don't.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:00.480]  Do you?
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:00.940]  No.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:01.840]  I mean, I can do it online.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:08.520]  Do an online dice, and we'll say that, you know, pick a number on the dice, and that's the dick. Let's see if you get it.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.400]  Alright, I'm gonna eat a hot dog. One in six chance.
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.120]  Let's say the...
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:16.660]  Are you sharing your screen?
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:26.660]  Oh, you have to. Also, I just want to point out, I'm not trying to hurry this along because I'm so fucking fascinated by what's going on right now, I have to see it through.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:31.560]  I've just realized, this is the shit we were talking about in the car on the way to Vita.
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:36.980]  Okay, I see it.
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:40.120]  Alright, here we go. So here's the dice, it says three right now. Did it die again?
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:40.880]  No, no, no, you're good.
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:41.700]  No, you're good.
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:44.820]  So I'm gonna hit roll. I'm gonna say four is a dick.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.040]  Okay.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:53.080]  So if I get one, two, three, five, or six, I got a free hot dog. Four, I've just given a... I've accidentally given a guy a blowjob.
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:54.480]  A free hot dog.
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:55.620]  Alright.
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.180]  Free hot dog, baby!
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:05.440]  Gavin, let's try you. Pick a number.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.560]  Oh, man.
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:07.880]  Yeah, we all have to do it.
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:09.420]  Five is the penis.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:10.520]  Alright, here we go.
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:13.400]  Free dog!
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.940]  Number three, free hot dog. Andrew, what's your number?
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:19.840]  I think a three is safe, because it was just three.
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:25.600]  Alright, here we go. That's not how chance works, but six, you were safe. Absolutely. Eric?
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:27.300]  Number one.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:32.480]  Eric's rolling on number one. Number five, he's very... not only did he not eat the dick...
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.360]  Free hot dogs!
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:36.600]  He's so far away from the dick when he's eating his own hot dog.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.300]  Nick, last chance.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.740]  I'll go with a nine.
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:43.200]  Okay.
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.720]  Yeah, it's one through six.
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:45.540]  Okay, so it's one to six.
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:46.940]  You're right, you're right, you're right.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.580]  I don't know why I said nine. Let's go with six.
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:50.340]  Oh, that wasn't a bit.
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:51.960]  Jesus Christ.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.460]  Oh, you're right next to it.
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:55.860]  Oh, that was close.
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.000]  You were cock-adjacent while you were eating that hot dog.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.360]  Geoff, Geoff, you think those legs would tip me off?
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.480]  Don't you just want one more hot dog?
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.180]  Let me try.
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.940]  I'm gonna eat hot dog number two.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:09.660]  Okay.
[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:11.300]  Hey!
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.440]  I'm fine.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:17.680]  There's a guy laying in condiments right now going, what the fuck?
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:18.580]  What happened?
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:19.600]  I was told.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.180]  What the hell?
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.500]  How did they know?
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.080]  It sounds like Eric just wants to keep rolling for cock.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.880]  No, no, no. I just wanted to see if Geoff would and he did.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.480]  And he got free hot dogs, baby.
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.560]  I mean, I'm never hungry. I'm never completely full after one dog.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.340]  Okay, so it sounds like Gavin wants to keep rolling for cocks.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:42.200]  All right, Gavin, what hot dog are you going to eat, Gavin?
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:44.380]  Number five is the penis.
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.480]  Here we go.
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:47.500]  Hey!
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.500]  I got greedy.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.040]  You got greedy.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:56.540]  Thanks for listening to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.800]  Gavin, why don't you gurgle us out?
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:01.640]  Come on.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.280]  Andrew did it for us.
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:07.040]  Oh, gross.
[01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:14.560]  I don't want this to keep going. I'm actually okay with it ending in what?
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.480]  Oh, I think it ended at some point.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:18.500]  It ended with Gavin eating dicks.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:18.980]  Yep.
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.680]  I meant the show.
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:24.560]  That was a real 2007 conversation for a podcast.
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:25.520]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:27.100]  Goddamn.
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.300]  Maybe we need Gracie back.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:29.360]  Yes.
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:34.600]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:38.340]  We are behind yet again, so here are some predictions for episode 201.
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.400]  Geoff starts a new business.
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.600]  The Panton card is worth thousands.
