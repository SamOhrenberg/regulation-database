[00:11.680 --> 00:13.700]  Yeah, I'm the first one.
[00:13.880 --> 00:14.740]  What do you mean you're the first one?
[00:15.160 --> 00:16.920]  I was recording before anyone else was.
[00:17.320 --> 00:18.620]  I've been recording for two minutes.
[00:23.660 --> 00:26.640]  Look at me! I've got two minutes recording time.
[00:26.920 --> 00:30.620]  When you sync this up, can you let us know who actually did in fact record first?
[00:31.100 --> 00:31.760]  We'll find out!
[00:32.460 --> 00:36.700]  It's definitely Gavin, because I started five seconds prior. I didn't know he was recording two minutes.
[00:36.820 --> 00:38.120]  There wasn't even two minutes!
[00:38.780 --> 00:39.260]  What's your timer?
[00:39.260 --> 00:41.320]  What's my timer right now? Give me a second.
[00:41.420 --> 00:42.560]  32 seconds.
[00:43.900 --> 00:45.800]  42! 44! 45! 46!
[00:45.800 --> 00:46.980]  I'm a minute 33.
[00:47.680 --> 00:48.340]  You loser!
[00:49.500 --> 00:50.240]  Good for you.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.460]  You know what they say, first the worst, second the best.
[00:53.920 --> 00:55.100]  Just throwing that out there.
[00:55.360 --> 00:56.240]  Think about that.
[00:56.460 --> 00:57.480]  We're in a playground era.
[00:59.160 --> 01:00.320]  We're in a playground era.
[01:00.740 --> 01:03.480]  What an unfortunate transition of eras.
[01:03.600 --> 01:05.580]  On paper, that does not look great.
[01:06.020 --> 01:07.340]  Oh, come into the playground?
[01:07.340 --> 01:09.120]  Oh, no.
[01:10.280 --> 01:13.160]  Alright, so we start here. Go ahead, Geoff.
[01:13.820 --> 01:18.220]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:18.800 --> 01:27.940]  This is episode 202. It is our 201st episode, and we are so excited to be presenting our special brand of comedy and friendship to you.
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.640]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[01:32.040 --> 01:34.180]  Fellas, start entertaining.
[01:34.700 --> 01:36.320]  Do you know what made me excited the other day?
[01:36.320 --> 01:37.840]  What? Who?
[01:38.320 --> 01:41.060]  I was talking to Nick in real life, and I made him laugh.
[01:41.480 --> 01:43.840]  And the real life laugh hits different.
[01:45.140 --> 01:46.640]  I'd assume it's the exact same.
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.240]  I mean, it is. But I was just like, wow, I'm witnessing it live.
[01:51.340 --> 01:54.800]  It's different. It's different in that you feel it differently when you're in the same room.
[01:55.680 --> 01:56.160]  Interesting.
[01:56.500 --> 01:58.100]  I've never made Nick laugh in person.
[01:58.440 --> 01:58.460]  What?
[01:58.940 --> 02:00.040]  That's life goals.
[02:00.360 --> 02:00.540]  No.
[02:01.640 --> 02:03.460]  Okay, never mind. Nick said no.
[02:03.460 --> 02:07.140]  What are you talking about? Have you ever been in a room with me? Come on!
[02:08.060 --> 02:11.940]  We were hanging out at the company's ending party, briefly.
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.760]  There's an ending party for the company?
[02:17.360 --> 02:22.100]  I don't know what it was. It was just, I got a calendar invite that everyone was going to be at Easy Tiger, so I just went along.
[02:22.480 --> 02:23.500]  How was it? Was it nice?
[02:25.780 --> 02:26.420]  Uh, yeah.
[02:28.240 --> 02:30.080]  Was the ending party nice?
[02:30.320 --> 02:31.900]  It was a lot of the same conversations.
[02:33.300 --> 02:38.260]  You see someone and say, how's it going? And everyone's like, yeah, dog shit. The world's ending, dog shit.
[02:38.480 --> 02:44.200]  Who was the event organizer? David Duke? That sounds like a terrible party.
[02:44.640 --> 02:46.940]  Interesting choice for event organizer.
[02:47.520 --> 02:52.260]  I also met a bunch of people, and I spoke to them for the first time at the last thing the company's doing.
[02:53.260 --> 02:54.260]  Who's David Duke?
[02:54.880 --> 02:58.660]  David Duke was a racist politician from Louisiana.
[02:58.660 --> 03:05.580]  I don't know why. I think he was the head of the Ku Klux Klan for a while.
[03:05.980 --> 03:06.680]  David Jones?
[03:08.260 --> 03:10.520]  David Jones is who I meant, right?
[03:10.620 --> 03:14.760]  Who the fuck is David Jones? Davy Jones from Davy Jones' Locker?
[03:15.320 --> 03:16.900]  Or Davy Jones from The Monkey?
[03:17.040 --> 03:18.380]  Who's the Jonestown guy?
[03:18.380 --> 03:19.840]  Davy Jones, the locker guy.
[03:20.340 --> 03:22.100]  The locker guy? Or the guy from The Monkeys?
[03:22.920 --> 03:24.840]  What was the Jonestown guy's name?
[03:25.580 --> 03:26.340]  Jim Jones?
[03:26.340 --> 03:30.060]  Jim Jones! There we go! That's who I meant!
[03:30.780 --> 03:32.940]  But you started it David Duke?
[03:33.440 --> 03:39.080]  I went into the evil man folder in my brain, and that's what came out first.
[03:39.500 --> 03:41.240]  So Sigourney Weaver started a party.
[03:42.300 --> 03:44.120]  It's the illiterate thing, right?
[03:44.260 --> 03:46.400]  Because it's David Duke, Jim Jones...
[03:46.400 --> 03:49.240]  He was getting caught up on the same letter, first name, last name thing.
[03:50.620 --> 03:52.800]  Once we realized there was a problem, I went,
[03:52.800 --> 03:56.340]  Well, I know it's Jonestown, so it has to be a Jones last name.
[03:56.880 --> 03:58.720]  And then we carried on from there.
[04:00.260 --> 04:02.280]  Let's run that back. Let's do Fluke Face.
[04:02.640 --> 04:07.040]  So you had an end party, and it was hosted by Jim Jones?
[04:08.000 --> 04:08.920]  That was perfect.
[04:09.460 --> 04:09.940]  Thanks.
[04:11.560 --> 04:12.500]  I practiced.
[04:12.860 --> 04:17.720]  I was talking about this a little bit in my So Alright podcast that I recorded today.
[04:18.500 --> 04:24.560]  It's so weird because everything is ending and wrapping up, but for like two months.
[04:25.140 --> 04:28.780]  So it's like the most prolonged series of goodbyes ever.
[04:30.620 --> 04:32.040]  Does anybody else feel that way?
[04:32.220 --> 04:32.480]  Oh yeah.
[04:32.740 --> 04:40.540]  Every time I talk to somebody, I feel like it's just continuing the same long conversation that's just kind of always happening.
[04:40.540 --> 04:45.540]  I don't know. It's the weirdest thing to sit in and just like...
[04:45.540 --> 04:48.520]  We have another five weeks of it or four weeks of it ahead of us, you know?
[04:49.220 --> 04:50.820]  We've already been doing it for three weeks.
[04:52.160 --> 04:55.120]  Yeah, and I keep having a really good time with people that I've never met before.
[04:55.240 --> 04:56.660]  And I'm like, Man, where were they the whole time?
[04:57.140 --> 04:58.660]  But it really was where was I the whole time.
[04:58.820 --> 05:00.760]  Trying to hang out with you, but you were reclusive?
[05:02.400 --> 05:04.360]  Oh man. Death party.
[05:06.340 --> 05:06.980]  Sounds terrible.
[05:07.080 --> 05:08.620]  It was just a happy hour.
[05:08.620 --> 05:10.820]  It was just a thing to get together to be like,
[05:10.960 --> 05:13.860]  Why did he call it a death party?
[05:14.300 --> 05:18.020]  It's Gavin. You're never going to get that answered. I don't know.
[05:18.420 --> 05:19.540]  Did I call it a death party?
[05:20.040 --> 05:21.220]  You definitely did.
[05:21.760 --> 05:23.360]  I don't think I did.
[05:23.480 --> 05:27.560]  And by that, I'm once again established I'm not a reliable narrator when I say that.
[05:30.840 --> 05:32.420]  But you absolutely did.
[05:32.420 --> 05:36.960]  You called it an ending party.
[05:37.120 --> 05:42.700]  Andrew brought in cults and racist politicians for some reason.
[05:43.200 --> 05:47.640]  I say this lovingly, but I think the British Jackal is going to have a clip next week.
[05:47.840 --> 05:48.740]  And I'm ready for it.
[05:52.120 --> 05:54.900]  Did you call him the British Jackal?
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.200]  I just called him the British Jackal. I don't know why.
[05:58.800 --> 06:00.460]  That's so cool.
[06:00.460 --> 06:02.400]  That's the coolest nickname.
[06:02.900 --> 06:04.360]  The British Jackal?
[06:04.560 --> 06:07.060]  It makes him sound like he wears sunglasses all the time.
[06:07.120 --> 06:08.220]  That's so awesome.
[06:08.780 --> 06:10.180]  I love the British Jackal.
[06:10.600 --> 06:13.280]  The British Jackal could be a wrestler.
[06:13.620 --> 06:15.600]  He could be an international man of mystery.
[06:15.600 --> 06:16.800]  He could be a spy.
[06:17.080 --> 06:18.680]  It applies to a lot of things.
[06:18.880 --> 06:20.260]  It's pretty wide open.
[06:20.500 --> 06:23.080]  I would jump on that if I were you, Gav.
[06:24.000 --> 06:24.960]  Are you talking about me?
[06:25.420 --> 06:25.800]  Yeah!
[06:26.480 --> 06:28.360]  Who else would I be talking about?
[06:28.360 --> 06:30.080]  Who the fuck else is bro?
[06:30.280 --> 06:32.160]  What are you talking?
[06:32.520 --> 06:33.860]  You think he's talking about Gracie?
[06:35.500 --> 06:39.120]  He's just been saying names for the last five minutes. I don't know what you're talking about.
[06:39.720 --> 06:41.180]  Gracie the British Jackal.
[06:41.440 --> 06:42.020]  That's it.
[06:42.880 --> 06:43.780]  I don't know what day it is.
[06:43.820 --> 06:47.940]  When I see that screenshot on this call, I think British Jackal.
[06:48.200 --> 06:49.280]  They've done it again.
[06:49.280 --> 06:59.580]  It's becoming clear to me in recording these back-to-back episodes that Andrew and Gavin are diminishing around us.
[06:59.660 --> 07:00.820]  In front of us.
[07:01.260 --> 07:03.620]  I'm starting to get a little worried about you two.
[07:03.720 --> 07:08.340]  Because we need to start a new thing together and you guys are twisting in the wind right now.
[07:08.440 --> 07:10.160]  Well, you gotta break the old thing.
[07:10.280 --> 07:15.140]  The foundation is cracked and we just aren't going to break it more until we build a house.
[07:15.140 --> 07:19.140]  I just got it jacked up 1.14 inches or whatever.
[07:19.360 --> 07:20.460]  The foundation is fine.
[07:21.000 --> 07:22.360]  Jacked up 1.4 inches.
[07:22.780 --> 07:23.100]  Oh God.
[07:23.960 --> 07:24.200]  Cum era.
[07:26.120 --> 07:28.300]  That was a cum shoe horn.
[07:30.140 --> 07:34.740]  This is going to go down as our weirdest start to an episode.
[07:35.800 --> 07:37.300]  Andrew, are you okay?
[07:38.000 --> 07:39.140]  I said, listen.
[07:39.520 --> 07:42.680]  We talked about a chisel and you brought it to the cum era.
[07:42.680 --> 07:47.920]  And Geoff's over here talking about jacking his 1.4 and that's a stretch for cum?
[07:48.280 --> 07:49.280]  Get out of here.
[07:49.300 --> 07:50.420]  That is a stretch for cum.
[07:50.880 --> 07:54.260]  No, it's not. He's jacking away at his 1.4.
[07:54.620 --> 07:55.820]  What's 1.4?
[07:56.760 --> 07:58.660]  It was 1.14.
[07:58.780 --> 07:59.420]  That's the worldiest dick in the world.
[08:01.520 --> 08:06.760]  You've seen my dick, Gavin. You've seen my dick a bunch. It's perfectly fine. It's a totally fine dick.
[08:08.460 --> 08:11.900]  Stop, stop. The British Jackal's here and she's going to get mad.
[08:15.320 --> 08:18.560]  Gracie, congratulations on being on the new nickname.
[08:19.900 --> 08:23.480]  I'm jealous, honestly. I wish somebody would call me the British Jackal.
[08:24.020 --> 08:25.680]  Weren't you Metal Snake?
[08:26.280 --> 08:26.520]  Yeah.
[08:26.660 --> 08:28.800]  Wow, Metal Snake to British Jackal?
[08:29.180 --> 08:32.120]  Yeah, I've really, you know, elevated.
[08:33.860 --> 08:35.640]  Would you even know how that came about, Gracie?
[08:35.640 --> 08:41.500]  Say we were at the death party that just happened and you were like, hey, I'm British Jackal. I'd be like, oh, how'd you get that name?
[08:42.480 --> 08:43.280]  No, I, no.
[08:43.920 --> 08:45.300]  What are you talking about?
[08:47.040 --> 08:48.080]  What are you saying?
[08:48.660 --> 08:49.480]  What are you saying?
[08:50.980 --> 08:52.220]  What is anyone saying?
[08:52.600 --> 08:54.500]  No, what was the point of your story?
[08:55.200 --> 08:58.960]  It was a story. It was a scenario where I was like, can you even explain that back to its origin?
[08:59.540 --> 08:59.700]  No.
[09:00.620 --> 09:01.940]  Okay, I see.
[09:01.980 --> 09:04.480]  I mean, it did just happen in front of you right now, Gracie.
[09:04.480 --> 09:09.380]  Right, but like I'm talking to a third party. No, wouldn't even bother.
[09:15.310 --> 09:16.870]  How does anybody get a nickname?
[09:17.070 --> 09:17.470]  Well, I don't know.
[09:17.550 --> 09:17.810]  Exactly.
[09:18.730 --> 09:19.630]  Why is it your business?
[09:22.770 --> 09:29.150]  I'll tell you. I'll tell you the first thing a British Jackal doesn't do. It's justify their name to you.
[09:29.970 --> 09:31.610]  Never going to explain himself.
[09:31.910 --> 09:36.350]  I felt like the British part really narrowed it into who I was talking about.
[09:36.350 --> 09:40.670]  What am I the only British person on this show? Yes.
[09:41.070 --> 09:45.730]  Yeah, you're kind of the British part. He's the Canadian. I'm the American. You're the Brit.
[09:45.830 --> 09:48.350]  It's kind of our thing for 202 episodes.
[09:48.350 --> 09:50.350]  Yeah, but you talked about other British people.
[09:51.070 --> 09:54.810]  Yeah, but I said, I think the British Jackal is going to have a clip for next week.
[09:54.890 --> 09:59.050]  You're always bringing clips up. No one else is doing the clips. You're a clips man.
[10:00.290 --> 10:00.950]  Oh, okay.
[10:01.410 --> 10:02.730]  You got a lot of clips.
[10:02.730 --> 10:09.730]  So we had almost 201 episodes of material in us is what I'm learning.
[10:10.250 --> 10:13.090]  God damn it. We're just so god damn stupid.
[10:14.090 --> 10:16.690]  Turns out Warner Brothers knew what they were doing.
[10:18.090 --> 10:20.130]  They timed it almost perfectly.
[10:20.630 --> 10:23.770]  I'll be honest with you. I had the weirdest night's sleep of my entire life.
[10:24.110 --> 10:31.130]  I woke up from a nightmare exactly every hour from like 11 until 4.
[10:31.650 --> 10:32.230]  Same nightmare?
[10:32.230 --> 10:33.450]  No, different nightmares.
[10:33.790 --> 10:36.210]  It was always like the time and 50 minutes.
[10:36.570 --> 10:39.370]  And I somehow pissed like a full bladder every single time.
[10:39.470 --> 10:40.910]  I don't know where all this was coming from.
[10:41.450 --> 10:44.950]  So how many hours or how many times did you wake up then?
[10:45.110 --> 10:48.130]  Did you sleep for eight hours? Was it eight hours of pee and nightmares?
[10:49.210 --> 10:51.390]  It took me a while to get back to sleep each time.
[10:51.470 --> 10:55.070]  So I'd say it was maybe combined it was like five or six hours.
[10:56.310 --> 10:59.070]  Did the five or six nightmares...
[10:59.930 --> 11:02.170]  Could you string them together into some sort of a narrative?
[11:02.350 --> 11:04.990]  Or were they all completely separate?
[11:06.790 --> 11:09.430]  That was a question for you Gavin, just so you know.
[11:09.570 --> 11:10.730]  My computer cut out. Hang on.
[11:11.950 --> 11:13.910]  Let me answer on his behalf.
[11:14.470 --> 11:15.230]  Can you not hear me now?
[11:15.690 --> 11:16.410]  Yeah, we can hear you.
[11:16.410 --> 11:17.590]  No, I can hear you.
[11:17.910 --> 11:20.050]  Odessy is a blank white screen.
[11:21.730 --> 11:23.530]  Oh, who's recording first now, motherfucker?
[11:26.030 --> 11:27.270]  Eat my dust.
[11:28.310 --> 11:29.750]  Hang on, is it going to pull through?
[11:30.370 --> 11:32.090]  Is it going to pull through? Come on.
[11:32.330 --> 11:33.010]  Oh, please.
[11:33.270 --> 11:33.750]  Come on now.
[11:34.250 --> 11:35.290]  Stop saying that.
[11:35.350 --> 11:35.930]  How does this happen?
[11:36.050 --> 11:39.350]  Don't you have like the most powerful equipment of all of us?
[11:39.710 --> 11:39.910]  No.
[11:40.530 --> 11:40.890]  Test.
[11:41.750 --> 11:43.330]  Oh, he can't even. I'm talking to no one.
[11:43.690 --> 11:46.290]  No, no, I was listening. I was just trying to get my waveform.
[11:46.890 --> 11:49.150]  Yeah, I guess I could have just answered the question instead of saying that.
[11:51.810 --> 11:54.150]  But then the waveform wouldn't have known you were testing.
[11:54.810 --> 11:58.530]  I think we're good. I think there may be some slippage there in the edit.
[11:58.770 --> 12:00.750]  Where's your waveform right now? What timer?
[12:02.070 --> 12:03.150]  Oh, that's a good question.
[12:03.470 --> 12:04.050]  Where are you at?
[12:04.110 --> 12:04.790]  13 minutes.
[12:05.550 --> 12:08.570]  Fuck! You've gotten further ahead somehow.
[12:09.010 --> 12:12.110]  How? I'm at 1215. He was a minute and a half ahead of me before.
[12:12.230 --> 12:15.150]  Fuck! I'm slowing down. What is happening?
[12:15.770 --> 12:17.610]  I think we're all experiencing time drift.
[12:18.310 --> 12:19.390]  I think it's plausible.
[12:19.930 --> 12:24.770]  Dude, speaking of that, they're onto me with the backwards robocalls. Haven't had another one.
[12:25.030 --> 12:27.970]  I think they were worried I was going to record one.
[12:28.510 --> 12:28.990]  Interesting.
[12:29.710 --> 12:30.090]  Really?
[12:30.770 --> 12:34.810]  You stopped those? I still haven't gotten anything like that.
[12:34.930 --> 12:39.650]  I've been anticipating a weird call of some kind because you both have been getting...
[12:41.670 --> 12:47.430]  All my fun is over. Nobody has called me and tried to sell me anything since the last...
[12:47.430 --> 12:48.690]  Which I'm a little bummed about.
[12:50.090 --> 12:53.310]  I have a very odd question, but it's tied to sleep.
[12:54.050 --> 13:00.470]  I had a weird dream recently that involved Eric. Eric was part of the dream.
[13:01.930 --> 13:02.870]  Was it a cum dream?
[13:03.870 --> 13:07.170]  We're not doing... British Jackal says no more. Come on.
[13:07.850 --> 13:08.970]  Don't say the word!
[13:10.890 --> 13:13.430]  My dream was...
[13:13.950 --> 13:14.330]  What do you mean?
[13:14.730 --> 13:15.130]  What word?
[13:15.130 --> 13:17.710]  Just keep going. You're fine. Ignore Geoff.
[13:17.830 --> 13:18.190]  What word?
[13:19.050 --> 13:19.790]  No, keep going.
[13:20.290 --> 13:22.450]  Eric said come on, so let's come on.
[13:22.810 --> 13:23.370]  Okay.
[13:24.710 --> 13:26.470]  I'm jacking my 1.1.
[13:28.230 --> 13:29.830]  Andrew, please come on.
[13:30.450 --> 13:34.970]  I was dreaming that I ended up somehow back in 2015.
[13:36.110 --> 13:41.970]  And I was trying to get back home. I was in the States. I was in a different state, but I didn't know which state.
[13:41.970 --> 13:46.030]  And I was in 2015, and I encountered Eric at a mall.
[13:46.450 --> 13:53.830]  And I remembered that we had all agreed to have a code word to indicate if any of us had ever gone back in time.
[13:54.210 --> 13:56.970]  But then I couldn't remember the code word.
[13:57.050 --> 14:01.550]  And then I realized it also hasn't happened in this timeline yet, so it's a useless code word.
[14:02.970 --> 14:09.190]  But I was trying to convince Eric that we actually were friends and worked together in the future, and he was having none of it.
[14:09.190 --> 14:13.310]  It was not a convincing conversation with him.
[14:13.370 --> 14:15.010]  Did he not know who you are in 2015?
[14:15.590 --> 14:19.490]  Had no idea, and also still don't really know what he looks like.
[14:19.630 --> 14:23.350]  So, you know, none of this is going to help.
[14:23.890 --> 14:26.470]  I knew what Eric looked like, but I...
[14:26.470 --> 14:31.250]  Not concerned about it going that way. It's just sort of the reciprocation.
[14:31.470 --> 14:38.030]  There's a funny story of Geoff explaining the chicken dinner challenge on an episode of Sportsball that Eric is on.
[14:38.030 --> 14:40.270]  And Eric has no idea who I am.
[14:40.290 --> 14:43.090]  And it's funny to watch none in this context.
[14:43.550 --> 14:51.770]  But my question is, is there anything a person could say that could convince you that they were a time traveler?
[14:52.150 --> 14:53.210]  They just approached you.
[14:53.970 --> 14:54.470]  Interesting.
[14:55.310 --> 15:00.170]  And also, can I just say, really weirdly, it just kind of freaked me out.
[15:00.230 --> 15:04.450]  When you were relaying your dream just now, I got so much deja vu.
[15:04.450 --> 15:09.330]  It felt so familiar, like I've had a very, maybe not the same dream, but a very similar dream.
[15:09.430 --> 15:10.590]  It really creeped me out for a second.
[15:11.270 --> 15:18.650]  So you're saying, we can only have a code word for if we go back in time to after this point.
[15:19.110 --> 15:22.010]  Yeah, like a code word would only work to that point.
[15:22.650 --> 15:23.730]  And I was before that point.
[15:24.190 --> 15:25.610]  So we need to settle on the code word.
[15:26.290 --> 15:31.130]  Well, I think I was just curious if we had something, and I'd assume it would have to be from your childhood,
[15:31.290 --> 15:35.750]  like a word or like a phrase that would be like, oh, wow, Oklahoma person.
[15:36.390 --> 15:38.790]  Now it's got to be more a rattlesnake shampoo.
[15:40.630 --> 15:42.370]  It's got to be something that doesn't make any sense.
[15:47.230 --> 15:47.950]  Apocalypse Hoboken.
[15:48.810 --> 15:49.810]  I like that.
[15:50.390 --> 15:53.350]  I mean, it would be it would be British jackal.
[15:53.350 --> 15:56.970]  But I feel like we can't be British jackal.
[15:57.130 --> 15:59.250]  Well, also, Gracie's assume the identity now, too.
[15:59.390 --> 16:00.610]  It's true. Yeah.
[16:01.570 --> 16:03.850]  The problem would be, I'd say British jackal.
[16:03.930 --> 16:07.450]  And then nine years later, Eric would be like, that guy, that guy in the mall.
[16:07.670 --> 16:09.790]  Oh, my God. What at the mall?
[16:09.890 --> 16:10.910]  The British jackal.
[16:13.610 --> 16:14.730]  Speaking of the mall.
[16:16.510 --> 16:20.710]  You remember a while back, I came up with the idea for us to do that mall game.
[16:20.710 --> 16:23.330]  And we were just like we were starting to get into a bit of a mall era.
[16:23.470 --> 16:27.350]  We never I feel like we put our toes in it, but we never fully dove in yet.
[16:28.070 --> 16:31.290]  You know, I say yet because the future is obviously unwritten.
[16:31.890 --> 16:37.210]  One of the ideas I had when bouncing around was that we could all get mall jobs for a month or so.
[16:37.570 --> 16:40.610]  And just and then hang out and take our breaks together and stuff.
[16:41.750 --> 16:43.770]  Well, my calendar just cleared up.
[16:44.170 --> 16:47.930]  I was thinking, what's to stop us all from working at the mall now?
[16:47.930 --> 16:49.030]  We really could.
[16:49.270 --> 16:50.710]  I wanted to live in a mall.
[16:51.450 --> 16:55.350]  I wanted to find a place that where you could live.
[16:55.550 --> 17:01.710]  They're like because there's restrictions in most states and or provinces for like zoning laws.
[17:02.050 --> 17:04.990]  I'd love to find one where it would be legal to live in a mall.
[17:05.570 --> 17:06.850]  Just rent out a mall space.
[17:07.110 --> 17:11.010]  There've been a lot of those stories on Reddit lately where like I read two different ones.
[17:11.010 --> 17:17.290]  One where this group of friends built a apartment on top of a parking garage for years.
[17:17.430 --> 17:19.250]  They got away with it in like Philadelphia or somewhere.
[17:19.870 --> 17:21.930]  And then the other one was this dude.
[17:22.150 --> 17:23.230]  I think he was a criminal.
[17:23.350 --> 17:24.430]  He ended up going to jail for stuff.
[17:24.530 --> 17:30.490]  But he built an apartment behind like a stairwell in a mall and lived there for a couple years.
[17:30.990 --> 17:33.610]  And would come out at night and fuck around and then go back in in the daytime.
[17:33.850 --> 17:34.950]  Got away with it for years.
[17:35.370 --> 17:40.390]  Yeah, I've heard of people living in like fully boxed off rooms between rooms at the mall.
[17:40.390 --> 17:40.950]  Yeah.
[17:41.350 --> 17:42.450]  There's just no doors to them.
[17:42.510 --> 17:43.710]  You have to like cut your way in.
[17:43.910 --> 17:46.050]  You have like eight malls in a row, right, Andrew?
[17:46.150 --> 17:47.270]  So you gotta take your pick.
[17:47.490 --> 17:48.550]  Oh yeah, they're in a line.
[17:50.610 --> 17:51.990]  I could do that.
[17:52.050 --> 17:54.110]  Like a low stakes inside man.
[17:54.510 --> 18:01.170]  I'm just between a subway and a Japanese fast food place in the food court.
[18:01.830 --> 18:02.790]  I could do that.
[18:03.450 --> 18:04.590]  Why is Japanese fast food?
[18:05.470 --> 18:07.210]  I like Edo Japan for Canada.
[18:07.730 --> 18:09.310]  Like the mall Japanese place.
[18:09.310 --> 18:10.250]  Oh yeah.
[18:10.510 --> 18:15.390]  We used to have a place called Zen that advertised itself as Japanese fast food on South Congress.
[18:15.650 --> 18:16.330]  It was okay.
[18:16.530 --> 18:17.150]  It was like bowls.
[18:18.270 --> 18:21.770]  I feel like every mall cafeteria has that Asian place in it.
[18:21.990 --> 18:24.650]  I feel like that's part of the experience.
[18:25.350 --> 18:31.070]  Man, when I was at our mall the other day walking around, which by the way, still back, still kicking it.
[18:31.230 --> 18:33.670]  Really looking forward to us all working there soon.
[18:34.870 --> 18:37.210]  I saw that there's a new Philly cheesesteak place in our mall.
[18:37.210 --> 18:39.870]  I don't remember what it was called, but I got pretty excited about it.
[18:40.390 --> 18:41.750]  Do you think you want to eat there or work there?
[18:42.510 --> 18:42.870]  Both.
[18:43.910 --> 18:44.530]  Why not?
[18:45.250 --> 18:47.690]  No, I feel like I would work at like the Hallmark store.
[18:47.870 --> 18:49.070]  That seems like my speed.
[18:49.370 --> 18:54.710]  Do you think you would struggle with a food service job in the same way that you did in the past?
[18:55.350 --> 18:57.150]  Yeah, I would have a real problem with it.
[18:57.310 --> 18:59.230]  I worked fast food in high school.
[18:59.910 --> 19:03.210]  I was a dishwasher at Sydney's Fried Chicken, right?
[19:03.210 --> 19:10.110]  I'm sure I've talked about that a million times, but I got promoted to front of house where I could take orders and then I got demoted.
[19:10.930 --> 19:19.170]  I did that three times in the year and a half I worked there because every time I'd get promoted, I would make the customers uncomfortable.
[19:19.970 --> 19:21.970]  So they would make me go back and wash dishes.
[19:22.250 --> 19:23.510]  And I was like the...
[19:23.510 --> 19:25.670]  You always phrase it that way, but what were you actually doing?
[19:25.750 --> 19:26.690]  What was making them uncomfortable?
[19:27.190 --> 19:28.450]  I was just fucking with them.
[19:28.710 --> 19:29.710]  You know, I was just having fun.
[19:30.450 --> 19:31.870]  I was just being me at 17.
[19:32.730 --> 19:36.930]  But it kept being like, yeah, the customers aren't getting it.
[19:37.110 --> 19:38.390]  You can't do it anymore.
[19:38.470 --> 19:38.970]  You got to go back.
[19:39.650 --> 19:42.810]  I would like argue with them or I'd fuck with them or I don't know.
[19:42.850 --> 19:43.630]  I would just be me.
[19:44.070 --> 19:48.230]  And it was too off-putting to the people that are trying to buy fried chicken.
[19:48.950 --> 19:52.530]  And so every time they would give me like a week and they'd go, yeah, you're still back.
[19:52.790 --> 19:55.990]  I was the lowest man on the totem pole for a year and a half.
[19:56.110 --> 19:59.190]  I got three of my friends hired at that fast food restaurant.
[19:59.190 --> 20:05.470]  They all went on to be paid more and have more responsibility than I did the entire time I was there.
[20:05.650 --> 20:05.790]  They ended up just demoting you.
[20:06.470 --> 20:10.010]  Yeah, I was like permanently bottom rung.
[20:10.610 --> 20:15.990]  I'd still be washing dishes at that fast food restaurant today if I was trying to climb that ladder.
[20:16.570 --> 20:18.090]  I'd say the bottom rung is the coolest.
[20:19.570 --> 20:22.890]  It's always the one that the hero is hanging off in the end of the movie.
[20:28.010 --> 20:32.670]  What do you think your biggest childhood disappointment was?
[20:32.930 --> 20:37.670]  Like something like an ad you saw on TV and then you tried it and it was just GAC.
[20:38.210 --> 20:38.810]  I've got mine.
[20:39.490 --> 20:40.750]  I think I have mine.
[20:42.770 --> 20:43.510]  I'm thinking.
[20:43.950 --> 20:45.050]  One of you guys go ahead of me.
[20:45.410 --> 20:45.630]  Gav?
[20:46.370 --> 20:47.250]  Sunny Delight.
[20:47.670 --> 20:48.410]  Or Sunny D I guess.
[20:48.550 --> 20:51.310]  I remember thinking those ads were so cool.
[20:51.310 --> 20:57.870]  I remember when it came to the UK, everything was like so cool and sunny and basketball and shit.
[20:58.090 --> 20:59.130]  And it looked delicious.
[20:59.690 --> 21:00.330]  And I had some.
[21:00.650 --> 21:02.310]  And it just tastes like water.
[21:03.470 --> 21:04.830]  Like orangey thin water.
[21:05.190 --> 21:05.450]  Rank.
[21:06.390 --> 21:07.410]  Mine's not a product.
[21:07.690 --> 21:08.330]  It's a movie.
[21:09.050 --> 21:13.510]  But they sold me an idea that turned out to be utter bullshit.
[21:14.290 --> 21:18.310]  And for me, there was this movie that came out when I was a really young kid called The Explorers.
[21:19.230 --> 21:20.810]  I don't know if y'all ever saw it or remember it.
[21:20.810 --> 21:22.290]  It had River Phoenix in it.
[21:22.750 --> 21:25.230]  And it was about a bunch of kids my exact age.
[21:25.290 --> 21:26.190]  Because we were about the same age.
[21:26.750 --> 21:32.050]  And in their backyard, they kept getting ideas or like dreams or something about building a spaceship.
[21:32.250 --> 21:39.130]  And so out of like a trash can and a bunch of garbage around their neighborhood, they built a spaceship that worked and went to space.
[21:40.010 --> 21:44.030]  And I thought, I will be able to do this in my lifetime.
[21:44.150 --> 21:49.650]  And I figured out really quickly that that was complete and utter bullshit and trash cans are just trash cans.
[21:49.650 --> 21:57.070]  And I was so fucking... that was like one of those moments in my life where you get a dose of reality and you realize the world isn't magic.
[21:57.670 --> 21:58.570]  I got mine.
[21:59.430 --> 22:00.290]  When I was a kid.
[22:00.730 --> 22:08.410]  This was all within... this was me being persuaded by advertising and then being greatly disappointed at it is what it was.
[22:08.510 --> 22:09.790]  You found out the house hippo wasn't real?
[22:10.950 --> 22:14.230]  The house hippo was not... first of all, it is real. How dare you?
[22:14.370 --> 22:15.230]  Second of all, no.
[22:15.230 --> 22:17.750]  If anything, this would be a house hippo delight.
[22:18.410 --> 22:22.910]  I am not a big cheese person just because growing up milk allergy and whatnot.
[22:23.050 --> 22:30.050]  But I would see ads for cheese strings all the time and I'd see kids eating them in fun ways.
[22:30.470 --> 22:35.450]  And I was convinced at one point that these were fucking awesome.
[22:35.590 --> 22:37.370]  I've seen the cover for the Explorers.
[22:37.510 --> 22:38.610]  I didn't know. That's interesting.
[22:39.410 --> 22:41.570]  Look at how cool that cheese looks.
[22:42.170 --> 22:44.190]  He's riding a cheese board.
[22:44.790 --> 22:46.570]  He's got wacky hair.
[22:46.890 --> 22:48.550]  He looks fucking awesome.
[22:49.210 --> 22:49.250]  Yeah.
[22:49.550 --> 22:53.410]  And then I got one finally and I did the wacky hair thing.
[22:53.570 --> 22:58.970]  But then you keep pulling and eventually you just got a whole bunch of strands of cheese and it really loses its appeal.
[22:59.130 --> 23:01.750]  And it's also, for me, not something I'd really eat.
[23:01.970 --> 23:03.610]  It's called cheese strings though.
[23:03.790 --> 23:05.170]  Yeah. No, it is what it is.
[23:05.170 --> 23:09.590]  But I was convinced by the marketing that it was a lot cooler and I have a lot more fun with it than I did.
[23:10.390 --> 23:14.170]  I've just noticed there's no E at the end of cheese because it has to spell strings.
[23:14.170 --> 23:15.490]  And that's really pissing me off.
[23:15.770 --> 23:17.770]  Yeah, I agree actually.
[23:17.990 --> 23:18.270]  That's weird.
[23:21.710 --> 23:25.190]  But I guess cheese strings wouldn't look that good.
[23:25.610 --> 23:27.650]  My wife and my kid eat those things all day long.
[23:27.770 --> 23:30.790]  I like cheese, but I can't eat it in that format.
[23:31.410 --> 23:32.610]  Just, I can't.
[23:32.610 --> 23:33.310]  I was never into them.
[23:33.390 --> 23:37.150]  And people who eat them all cheesy, string-like, you see their tongue a lot.
[23:37.310 --> 23:37.690]  Yeah.
[23:38.170 --> 23:40.130]  They're trying to dangle it down their mouth hole.
[23:40.130 --> 23:44.790]  It's like trying to give a cheese stick a blowjob all day long.
[23:45.030 --> 23:45.890]  I don't get it.
[23:47.790 --> 23:50.030]  Did they ever do like a soft cheese interior?
[23:50.610 --> 23:51.010]  Oh.
[23:52.010 --> 23:53.890]  Like what's that, uh, raclette stuff?
[23:53.890 --> 23:56.070]  Like re on the inside or raclette? Oh yeah.
[23:56.070 --> 23:58.010]  Yeah, like really stringy.
[23:58.290 --> 23:59.710]  I guess it's all stringy.
[24:00.890 --> 24:02.050]  It is all stringy.
[24:02.270 --> 24:03.210]  That's sort of the point.
[24:03.690 --> 24:06.090]  You like hollow it out and fill it with ricotta and then close it.
[24:10.990 --> 24:13.190]  Gracie said hers is Heelys or moon shoes.
[24:13.330 --> 24:14.170]  What are moon shoes again?
[24:15.130 --> 24:18.890]  They were like the shoes that were supposed to make you bounce like twice as high.
[24:19.570 --> 24:21.410]  But they were really just clunkers.
[24:22.630 --> 24:23.750]  They were loud.
[24:24.670 --> 24:28.210]  And I think you probably jumped less high with them.
[24:28.350 --> 24:29.170]  Yeah, those, those.
[24:29.870 --> 24:30.770]  Yeah, those look awesome.
[24:31.390 --> 24:32.110]  They didn't work.
[24:32.170 --> 24:32.950]  Jumped less high.
[24:33.050 --> 24:33.270]  No.
[24:33.610 --> 24:37.550]  Like I remember in my garage, I would be banging around in there and nothing worked.
[24:42.430 --> 24:43.830]  I kind of want to test it.
[24:43.870 --> 24:45.170]  I kind of want to see if you can jump high with them.
[24:45.170 --> 24:46.430]  Yeah, I want to get some moon shoes now.
[24:46.570 --> 24:47.130]  No, you don't.
[24:48.130 --> 24:48.770]  They're terrible.
[24:49.150 --> 24:49.710]  Well, now I definitely want to.
[24:49.710 --> 24:50.630]  Gracie's 100% right.
[24:51.050 --> 24:51.650]  Oh, you're not good.
[24:52.530 --> 24:54.550]  Well, while I still have the card, I'll buy them.
[24:55.490 --> 24:55.810]  Okay.
[24:56.110 --> 24:56.370]  Thank you.
[24:56.370 --> 24:57.630]  We can still use our cards?
[24:58.070 --> 24:59.110]  A path for each of us.
[24:59.330 --> 25:00.810]  I'm gonna until it's taken away.
[25:01.250 --> 25:03.710]  Yeah, get a couple of moon shoes for us.
[25:03.750 --> 25:03.970]  That'd be great.
[25:03.970 --> 25:04.730]  Yeah, I'll get everyone a pair.
[25:05.370 --> 25:05.690]  Yay!
[25:06.410 --> 25:07.030]  But for real though?
[25:07.230 --> 25:07.530]  For comparison's sake.
[25:07.530 --> 25:09.090]  Why not?
[25:09.690 --> 25:09.950]  Yeah.
[25:11.990 --> 25:12.930]  What are they gonna do?
[25:14.010 --> 25:15.050]  Take our moon boots?
[25:15.270 --> 25:15.770]  I don't know.
[25:17.250 --> 25:18.150]  I think so.
[25:19.630 --> 25:22.390]  They'll take the card, but we'll still have our boots.
[25:23.790 --> 25:27.190]  That is a president I can get behind.
[25:27.510 --> 25:28.450]  I vote Gracie.
[25:29.030 --> 25:32.850]  I like the idea of these moon shoes going through the company though and being like
[25:32.850 --> 25:35.270]  bar-coded is probably a reason to do this.
[25:36.590 --> 25:39.650]  It's easier to ask for forgiveness than moon shoe permission.
[25:40.230 --> 25:40.630]  Exactly.
[25:41.290 --> 25:44.790]  It's like that scene in movies where a character goes bankrupt and the movers are like moving
[25:44.790 --> 25:47.850]  the things in their office while they're standing there, but with like shoes.
[25:49.270 --> 25:54.190]  I always visualize Adam Sandler diving onto the couch in Happy Gilmore as they're taking
[25:54.190 --> 25:54.570]  it away.
[25:56.790 --> 25:58.850]  Taking away his grandmother's shit.
[25:59.370 --> 26:01.270]  You know who was taking that couch away?
[26:01.410 --> 26:02.170]  That was Will Sasso.
[26:03.190 --> 26:04.590]  Oh, it was, wasn't it?
[26:04.590 --> 26:05.010]  Yeah.
[26:05.230 --> 26:08.370]  And then they watch him drive the ball into the house opposite.
[26:08.830 --> 26:09.090]  Yeah.
[26:10.130 --> 26:15.470]  The fucking, the only dude we ever tried to pay money for at Achievement Hunter who didn't
[26:15.470 --> 26:16.350]  want anything to do with us.
[26:16.570 --> 26:17.070]  Do you remember that?
[26:17.230 --> 26:20.470]  We tried to contact his agent when we did the first Let's Play Live.
[26:20.910 --> 26:23.510]  Yeah, we did the first Let's Play Live at the...
[26:23.510 --> 26:26.330]  What is the man's Chinese theater called now?
[26:26.470 --> 26:27.010]  Grauman's Theater?
[26:27.350 --> 26:28.270]  It's not even that.
[26:28.370 --> 26:29.450]  It's a...
[26:29.450 --> 26:30.270]  I mean, why did...
[26:30.270 --> 26:30.990]  What is it called?
[26:32.230 --> 26:33.390]  Where they do the Academy Awards.
[26:33.390 --> 26:34.190]  What is that place called?
[26:35.990 --> 26:36.430]  Anybody?
[26:36.870 --> 26:37.290]  Dolby Theater?
[26:37.510 --> 26:37.910]  Dolby Theater?
[26:38.290 --> 26:38.470]  Yeah.
[26:38.710 --> 26:42.090]  We did that show there, live, right?
[26:42.530 --> 26:49.890]  And we wanted to have Will Sasso come out and do his Doobie Brothers bit, singing in the
[26:49.890 --> 26:50.110]  shower.
[26:50.570 --> 26:54.570]  We wanted to just have him do that, which was a big thing in Achievement Hunter, him
[26:54.570 --> 26:55.290]  singing that song.
[26:55.710 --> 26:56.370]  You know, the...
[26:58.310 --> 27:00.130]  And we would always fucking...
[27:00.130 --> 27:07.310]  We would just brutalize it over and over and over in videos, singing it and lampooning
[27:07.310 --> 27:08.230]  him, lampooning it.
[27:08.830 --> 27:14.950]  And yeah, we got to his manager, I think, and pitched him and had money and everything.
[27:15.070 --> 27:16.750]  And he was like, no, no, thank you.
[27:17.910 --> 27:19.070]  It's two minutes of work.
[27:19.150 --> 27:19.490]  And he's like...
[27:20.890 --> 27:23.110]  I mean, there's no way we had enough money for him to go.
[27:23.630 --> 27:24.170]  Probably not.
[27:24.350 --> 27:26.290]  We had a little bit of money, not a lot of money.
[27:26.290 --> 27:28.490]  That was probably my favorite Vine.
[27:29.630 --> 27:30.650]  Yeah, me too.
[27:31.170 --> 27:33.010]  It might be the only Vine I liked.
[27:33.730 --> 27:41.470]  He also has an appearance in the 1996 Doctor Who movie, where the doctor dies and he's
[27:41.850 --> 27:44.710]  working in the hospital and then he regenerates and comes back to life.
[27:46.210 --> 27:52.030]  The Doctor in Doctor Who has had so many different deaths, like he's been killed by
[27:52.030 --> 27:53.990]  electricity or something in space.
[27:53.990 --> 28:00.890]  In the movie, the doctor lands the TARDIS in L.A. and gets gunned down by some guy in
[28:00.890 --> 28:01.250]  an alley.
[28:01.610 --> 28:02.870]  It's like so out of place.
[28:02.970 --> 28:04.290]  He just gets shot with an Uzi.
[28:04.990 --> 28:07.970]  And then, uh, Will Sasso watches him come back to life.
[28:08.670 --> 28:09.270]  That's fantastic.
[28:09.750 --> 28:14.250]  But I just like the first thing that he does in the USA is get shot to death.
[28:16.670 --> 28:18.850]  It's the quintessential American experience.
[28:19.830 --> 28:25.010]  I recently watched, I've been watching DCOMs, because they're just things I missed growing
[28:25.010 --> 28:25.210]  up.
[28:25.250 --> 28:25.770]  A lot of them.
[28:26.250 --> 28:31.710]  And I watched You Lucky Dog, which has one of those, they go bankrupt and they're taking
[28:31.710 --> 28:31.990]  the whole thing.
[28:32.270 --> 28:33.130]  This is You Lucky Dog.
[28:33.470 --> 28:34.410]  Kirk Cameron movie.
[28:35.330 --> 28:36.930]  1998, I want to say.
[28:37.790 --> 28:39.190]  It's really bad.
[28:39.550 --> 28:46.010]  It's about a guy that can, like, talk to his dog telepathically as a teenager, and so he's
[28:46.010 --> 28:46.910]  a dog therapist.
[28:46.910 --> 28:49.530]  But he lost the ability, so he's just conning people.
[28:50.090 --> 28:55.430]  But then he meets a million, like a billionaire type figure, and he reconnects with that dog,
[28:55.430 --> 28:58.030]  and then that guy dies, and he inherits all of his money.
[28:58.210 --> 28:59.950]  Because I guess the dog gets it.
[29:00.810 --> 29:06.530]  But a highlight is they try to do, like, they show flashbacks of him as a high school, like,
[29:06.590 --> 29:06.930]  teenager.
[29:07.410 --> 29:11.390]  And they did not try hard to make him look like a high school teenager.
[29:11.390 --> 29:17.990]  That is their attempt at Kirk Cameron, who's very clearly in his late 20s, trying to be
[29:17.990 --> 29:18.650]  like 12.
[29:19.150 --> 29:20.130]  There's a whole bunch of scenes.
[29:21.910 --> 29:23.070]  Highly recommend it, though.
[29:23.450 --> 29:24.330]  Great ending.
[29:24.690 --> 29:27.770]  One of the worst endings to any movie I've seen.
[29:28.510 --> 29:30.850]  It has the dad from Fresh Prince in it.
[29:31.370 --> 29:31.970]  He's great.
[29:32.730 --> 29:35.950]  But, spoil it, it's a whole court, the final act of the movie.
[29:36.610 --> 29:40.810]  Them trying to prove that he's not psychotic, and that he can actually talk to this dog,
[29:40.810 --> 29:47.310]  and he mimics the dog, and then he realizes that the dog witnessed the villains poisoning
[29:47.310 --> 29:48.690]  the guy and murdering him.
[29:49.150 --> 29:51.010]  And then he's like, I see what you did!
[29:51.110 --> 29:52.770]  And the dude pulls out a fucking gun.
[29:53.250 --> 29:53.970]  It's a shootout.
[29:54.190 --> 29:55.030]  It's dumb.
[29:55.330 --> 29:56.050]  It's a really dumb movie.
[29:56.330 --> 29:58.850]  But just when we're talking about move-out scenes.
[29:59.390 --> 30:00.030]  That one has one.
[30:00.410 --> 30:01.310]  I watched it recently.
[30:06.270 --> 30:10.150]  Ever tried to break a bad habit and felt like you're climbing Everest in flip-flops?
[30:10.790 --> 30:12.110]  Yeah, we've been there too.
[30:12.110 --> 30:14.230]  But here's a breath of fresh air.
[30:14.870 --> 30:15.030]  Fume.
[30:15.470 --> 30:18.190]  It's not about giving up, it's about switching up.
[30:18.690 --> 30:23.590]  Fume takes your habit and simply makes it better, healthier, and a whole lot more enjoyable.
[30:24.310 --> 30:28.410]  Fume is an innovative, award-winning flavored air device that does just that.
[30:28.850 --> 30:31.410]  Instead of vapor, fume uses flavored air.
[30:31.750 --> 30:34.530]  Instead of electronics, fume is completely natural.
[30:34.850 --> 30:38.490]  And instead of harmful chemicals, fume uses delicious flavors.
[30:39.110 --> 30:39.770]  You get it.
[30:39.770 --> 30:42.170]  Instead of bad, fume is good.
[30:42.490 --> 30:46.390]  It's a habit you're free to enjoy and makes replacing your bad habit easy.
[30:46.930 --> 30:52.350]  Your fume comes with an adjustable airflow dial and is designed with movable parts and magnets for fidgeting.
[30:52.570 --> 30:58.610]  Giving your fingers a lot to do, which is helpful for de-stressing and anxiety while breaking your habit.
[30:58.970 --> 31:02.670]  Now when I first saw fume and learned about it, I didn't know necessarily what to think.
[31:03.270 --> 31:08.330]  But immediately upon holding it, I was struck by how good it feels.
[31:08.330 --> 31:11.370]  It's just weighted so nicely. It's perfectly balanced.
[31:11.550 --> 31:15.010]  And as they said, it's just fun to fidget with. It's a thing you can play with.
[31:15.150 --> 31:18.390]  And as somebody who likes to fidget and play with things, I thought it was great.
[31:18.710 --> 31:20.330]  And I was also struck by how cool it looked.
[31:20.370 --> 31:24.230]  It's a really awesome design. It feels great. It looks awesome.
[31:24.330 --> 31:27.910]  It's something that you don't need to be embarrassed about using or being seen with in public.
[31:28.290 --> 31:34.750]  Plus, fume just released a magnetic stand for your fume, so there's no more losing it around the house.
[31:34.750 --> 31:39.050]  It's built with fidgeting in mind. You can spin your fume around on it.
[31:39.190 --> 31:40.310]  You can spin it. It's so cool.
[31:40.950 --> 31:46.510]  Start the year off right with a good habit by going to tryfume.com and getting the journey pack today.
[31:47.090 --> 31:54.250]  Fume is giving listeners of the show 10% off when they use my code FACE to help make starting the good habit that much easier.
[31:56.610 --> 32:00.470]  But I've had more drama with movies because I wanted to be like Geoff.
[32:00.710 --> 32:03.370]  I wanted to review the film of the year.
[32:03.370 --> 32:07.290]  So I tried to watch The Woman with the Red Lipstick.
[32:07.490 --> 32:07.830]  Oh!
[32:08.370 --> 32:11.010]  Geoff, you son of a bitch. You son of a bitch.
[32:11.110 --> 32:12.810]  Sucked you into a great movie, right?
[32:13.170 --> 32:16.930]  Well, no! I couldn't see it. But I went through a lot of effort to try.
[32:17.610 --> 32:24.910]  I looked it up. In Canada, it was only apparently available on a platform called, like, Udo?
[32:25.390 --> 32:29.110]  Or something like that? Fluboo? Flubo?
[32:29.790 --> 32:30.310]  Fuboodoo?
[32:30.310 --> 32:31.010]  Fuboodoo?
[32:32.790 --> 32:35.930]  It's a thing where you need a library card to do it.
[32:35.930 --> 32:36.330]  FuboTV?
[32:37.010 --> 32:40.010]  I don't think it was Fubo. I think it was, like, Voodoo.
[32:40.770 --> 32:43.130]  Okay. Like, V-U-D-U?
[32:43.350 --> 32:50.270]  Anyway, you go onto the site, and I went to register, and it said, you need your library card.
[32:50.410 --> 32:54.430]  And I went, oh, fuck, I don't have a library card. I guess I'll have to sign up for one.
[32:54.690 --> 33:00.090]  And then my local library didn't have one, so I had to lie about which library I'm local to.
[33:00.090 --> 33:06.650]  And I got a temporary online card, and I had to go through, like, several levels of verification.
[33:07.070 --> 33:10.210]  And then I submitted everything, and it said, ah, you gotta put your birthday in.
[33:10.510 --> 33:16.650]  And so I did that, and then the button that was lit up was clear all info, which deleted everything.
[33:17.010 --> 33:19.770]  And I had to do it again. It was a whole fucking process.
[33:20.370 --> 33:27.390]  And then I finally get there, and I tried to rent it, and it just said, not available.
[33:27.870 --> 33:34.530]  Sorry, but no copies of this digital works are there. So it's just lying to me.
[33:34.790 --> 33:36.090]  So I still haven't seen it.
[33:36.090 --> 33:38.430]  Do they have, like, a finite amount of digital rentals?
[33:38.770 --> 33:42.870]  I don't know. So I tried renting a different film, and it said that...
[33:42.870 --> 33:45.430]  Oh, and that reminds me, I need to watch it, I guess, by tomorrow.
[33:46.190 --> 33:49.130]  It expires Thursday night, and it returns itself.
[33:49.870 --> 33:55.890]  So I don't know if they were out of copies, or if they just never had copies, or why it's there, but...
[33:55.890 --> 34:04.990]  No, they're clearly out of copies, because my talking about it has created a run on the woman with the red lipstick globally, and everybody's getting in line to watch it.
[34:05.310 --> 34:09.510]  I'm sure you mentioned it at the time, but it's based on a true story?
[34:10.530 --> 34:15.410]  That's what they said in the opening credits. I don't know how true that is.
[34:15.670 --> 34:17.990]  I would love... I want to see it.
[34:17.990 --> 34:24.510]  I thought Picnic at Hanging Rock, which is one of my favorite movies of all time, Australian film from the Peter Weir movie from the late 70s, early 80s.
[34:24.850 --> 34:26.290]  If you've never seen it, you should absolutely watch it.
[34:27.130 --> 34:32.850]  It begins by saying this is based on a true story, and I spent my entire life thinking it was a true story, and then I read, like, four years ago,
[34:32.930 --> 34:35.870]  Yeah, no, we just put that in, because we thought it'd make it look cool.
[34:36.330 --> 34:38.590]  So I don't buy based on a true story any time.
[34:39.810 --> 34:40.230]  What's that?
[34:40.790 --> 34:41.550]  They Fargo'd you?
[34:41.950 --> 34:43.010]  They Fargo'd me, yeah.
[34:43.490 --> 34:45.510]  That's the only one I can think of, where they did that.
[34:46.670 --> 34:49.710]  Was it Fargo based on a true story? I mean, it was based on the...
[34:49.710 --> 34:52.650]  Oh, no, I'm thinking of the movie that the Zellner brothers made.
[34:54.030 --> 34:55.870]  That was based on the... Kumiko.
[34:56.230 --> 34:59.590]  That was based on the woman who thought Fargo was a true story.
[35:00.090 --> 35:00.290]  Yes.
[35:01.010 --> 35:03.290]  You just Amelia Earhart-ed yourself, is what you did.
[35:05.810 --> 35:06.470]  Isla Fisher.
[35:06.630 --> 35:07.970]  Into one. Yes.
[35:09.870 --> 35:12.010]  I hope you get to see it, though. It's a really great movie.
[35:12.110 --> 35:13.630]  Yeah, I'm trying. It's tough.
[35:14.270 --> 35:16.630]  It's only available in one place. I'd rent it.
[35:17.550 --> 35:19.630]  But it's not even streaming in Canada yet.
[35:20.350 --> 35:24.090]  Well, if the worst comes to worst, I can stream it here and FaceTime you.
[35:24.310 --> 35:25.270]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[35:25.270 --> 35:27.230]  I wonder if anybody's ever done that.
[35:27.570 --> 35:29.510]  Oh, definitely. 100%.
[35:29.510 --> 35:35.030]  I've seen my favorite one of those was the guy that was illegally Twitch streaming a UFC event,
[35:35.290 --> 35:39.550]  but just holding a controller, pretending that he was playing the UFC game.
[35:39.550 --> 35:46.030]  I think it's so blatantly not that.
[35:46.390 --> 35:46.950]  It's so funny.
[35:48.150 --> 35:48.270]  What?
[35:50.890 --> 35:52.310]  Kirk Cameron, though, right?
[35:53.190 --> 35:53.910]  Kirk Cameron.
[35:54.210 --> 35:57.970]  When I was a kid, I'm a little older than you all, so you might not remember this,
[35:57.990 --> 36:01.600]  but when I was a kid, Kirk Cameron was like the coolest kid.
[36:02.910 --> 36:04.630]  He was like he was TV famous.
[36:04.690 --> 36:07.810]  He was the like he was the cool teenage guy that, you know,
[36:07.810 --> 36:10.270]  we all looked like looked up to isn't the right word,
[36:10.370 --> 36:12.910]  but he was like the cool guy on TV that everybody wanted to be like.
[36:13.430 --> 36:15.550]  And then he like he went like super Christian, I think.
[36:16.350 --> 36:16.770]  Yes.
[36:16.910 --> 36:21.010]  It's weird because he was like he was like teen heartthrob.
[36:21.710 --> 36:22.690]  Everybody loved him.
[36:22.790 --> 36:23.450]  Height of fame.
[36:23.650 --> 36:27.550]  And then it's one of those things where you just like that show disappeared
[36:27.550 --> 36:30.310]  and it never translated into the next thing.
[36:30.630 --> 36:32.910]  And then he just wasn't anymore.
[36:33.450 --> 36:34.270]  What are you laughing at?
[36:34.710 --> 36:36.270]  Just the picture that Andrew posted.
[36:36.270 --> 36:37.150]  Oh, I didn't.
[36:45.590 --> 36:47.490]  He was an Oz, I think.
[36:47.610 --> 36:49.930]  Kirk Cameron, and he played like a priest in that.
[36:49.970 --> 36:50.850]  Or maybe I'm mistaking.
[36:51.350 --> 36:52.290]  No, you might be.
[36:52.370 --> 36:53.210]  You might be right.
[36:53.830 --> 36:56.930]  He had that movie right there, the You Lucky Dog one.
[36:57.110 --> 36:58.270]  And then I remember when that came out.
[36:58.330 --> 37:00.710]  And then he also had one with, I want to say Dudley Moore,
[37:01.570 --> 37:04.570]  where it was like Freaky Friday, but with people.
[37:05.770 --> 37:06.770]  Not the dog.
[37:07.050 --> 37:09.170]  Dudley Moore, Kirk Cameron.
[37:09.350 --> 37:10.970]  Was Kirk Cameron not in Oz?
[37:11.130 --> 37:12.510]  Like father, like son.
[37:13.030 --> 37:14.370]  Yeah, I don't think Kirk Cameron's in Oz.
[37:14.630 --> 37:18.750]  Like father, like son, where Dudley Moore and Kirk Cameron switched roles.
[37:19.470 --> 37:21.770]  And then Kirk Cameron talked to a dog.
[37:23.010 --> 37:24.910]  Maybe it was the roles he was getting after.
[37:29.170 --> 37:31.590]  Who the fuck was the priest in Oz?
[37:31.970 --> 37:33.570]  Why didn't you know who anyone is today?
[37:33.570 --> 37:35.210]  I don't know.
[37:36.470 --> 37:37.970]  Jeremiah Cloutier, who is he?
[37:38.510 --> 37:39.130]  Luke Perry.
[37:39.690 --> 37:40.570]  It was Luke Perry.
[37:41.110 --> 37:41.990]  It wasn't...
[37:41.990 --> 37:42.370]  Fuck.
[37:44.990 --> 37:46.510]  They're kind of the same.
[37:47.490 --> 37:49.150]  Don't try to justify it.
[37:49.430 --> 37:50.830]  The Susan Sarandon thing already sunk you.
[37:50.950 --> 37:53.030]  This is just another nail in your coffin, bud.
[37:54.050 --> 37:56.090]  Another name I will get wrong on my coffin.
[37:58.730 --> 38:00.430]  They have similar energy.
[38:01.170 --> 38:03.250]  I don't feel bad about that one.
[38:03.570 --> 38:05.590]  You think they have similar energy?
[38:06.610 --> 38:08.630]  I mean, they look kind of the same.
[38:08.910 --> 38:09.890]  They're both heartthrobs.
[38:10.550 --> 38:12.330]  This is such a song and dance.
[38:13.830 --> 38:17.610]  Gavin, Gavin, can I rewind a little bit to you?
[38:17.870 --> 38:18.090]  Sure thing.
[38:18.110 --> 38:20.410]  You started talking about nightmares.
[38:21.030 --> 38:23.750]  And then your computer fucked up.
[38:24.050 --> 38:24.650]  Oh yeah.
[38:25.110 --> 38:26.290]  What was up with the nightmares?
[38:27.070 --> 38:30.950]  One of them, some woman was chasing me down a dark street.
[38:31.330 --> 38:32.570]  But for some reason I couldn't...
[38:32.570 --> 38:32.950]  Cucumbers?
[38:34.390 --> 38:34.950]  No, it wasn't her.
[38:35.490 --> 38:37.710]  But I couldn't turn around. I could only run backwards.
[38:37.990 --> 38:39.370]  And then I couldn't even look around.
[38:39.450 --> 38:41.430]  And I was like, oh, I'm going to run into something.
[38:41.510 --> 38:42.630]  And she was gaining on me.
[38:43.330 --> 38:45.670]  And she got real close, like...
[38:45.670 --> 38:46.270]  Then I woke up.
[38:47.290 --> 38:48.990]  Were you scared you were going to have to kick her?
[38:49.150 --> 38:49.770]  Was she small?
[38:51.870 --> 38:52.190]  No.
[38:53.150 --> 38:54.370]  She was kind of attractive, too.
[38:54.410 --> 38:55.770]  I don't really know why I was so scared.
[38:56.970 --> 38:59.090]  I just remember I had to get out of there.
[39:00.390 --> 39:01.750]  Was she wearing open-footed shoes?
[39:01.750 --> 39:02.510]  No, yeah.
[39:04.330 --> 39:06.010]  Was she menacing to you?
[39:06.090 --> 39:08.430]  Like, did you feel like you were in danger? Physically?
[39:09.810 --> 39:13.010]  Yeah, I think she'd been, like, hunting me for most of the dream.
[39:13.570 --> 39:14.690]  And then she found me.
[39:16.850 --> 39:17.250]  Huh.
[39:18.090 --> 39:21.190]  I'm surprised it wakes you... you got woken up every time.
[39:21.570 --> 39:23.990]  It's very rare that a nightmare will wake me up now.
[39:24.450 --> 39:27.590]  And then, see, and you woke up and you immediately had a full bladder and had to pee.
[39:28.550 --> 39:33.910]  I've done a lot of dream interpretation, and I don't want to get into it too deeply, but you're fucked.
[39:34.330 --> 39:35.370]  Could it be...
[39:35.370 --> 39:36.110]  Yeah, that's not good.
[39:36.490 --> 39:42.430]  You were sweating a lot, and then your body was absorbing that liquid, and then refilling the bladder, maybe?
[39:43.270 --> 39:45.290]  I don't know. I have been really hot in the night.
[39:46.130 --> 39:47.010]  Oh, no, that too.
[39:47.210 --> 39:48.010]  Sounds like I'm right.
[39:49.390 --> 39:50.550]  Sounds like I nailed it.
[39:50.550 --> 40:03.950]  I woke up the other day, and I took the ugliest picture of myself, because I realized my sleep mask had slipped down my face, and when I pulled it back off, it pushed all of my... it pushed all of my mustache hair up my nose.
[40:06.010 --> 40:07.290]  Oh, no.
[40:07.290 --> 40:08.130]  Oh, my God.
[40:11.570 --> 40:15.010]  Imagine what his asshole looked like when it got waxed.
[40:15.150 --> 40:19.150]  It looks like you're just breathing... you're breathing beard.
[40:19.150 --> 40:22.570]  It looks like I've got severe nose hair problem.
[40:23.390 --> 40:31.110]  That doesn't make you create... like, you don't trim the length of your mustache part. Like, I can't stand that.
[40:31.330 --> 40:32.070]  What do you mean?
[40:32.850 --> 40:38.070]  If a mustache hair, like, tickles my nose, I, like, cut it. I have to keep it short.
[40:38.230 --> 40:43.810]  Well, that wouldn't be anything on my lip. Like, if I push up on all that hair, of course it's gonna go to my nose. Wouldn't it for anyone?
[40:45.750 --> 40:46.150]  No.
[40:46.250 --> 40:47.850]  I mean, there's some smaller noses out there, I guess.
[40:48.630 --> 40:52.310]  I... yeah, I'll be honest, I'm having trouble getting the hair up to the...
[40:52.310 --> 40:52.950]  Right, me too.
[40:53.090 --> 40:56.590]  You can't just, like, push from your lip. Just push it into your nostrils.
[40:56.770 --> 40:59.750]  Not in a way that it would come even close to staying.
[40:59.850 --> 41:01.070]  Not like that.
[41:01.230 --> 41:01.590]  No.
[41:02.090 --> 41:02.370]  Wow.
[41:02.730 --> 41:04.570]  No. I think that's a you thing.
[41:06.450 --> 41:11.030]  It looks like a spigot somebody turned on and it's hair coming out instead of water.
[41:11.290 --> 41:13.270]  It looks like it's dispensing my beard.
[41:13.630 --> 41:13.830]  Yeah.
[41:17.410 --> 41:18.630]  It's a horror show.
[41:18.910 --> 41:20.770]  Gracie says that is so disturbing.
[41:21.150 --> 41:21.650]  It is.
[41:24.390 --> 41:26.090]  You look like you're generating...
[41:26.090 --> 41:30.950]  And this is coming from the British Jackal who sent us that tub photo last episode.
[41:31.530 --> 41:34.690]  But that is, like, 99% just my normal face, Gracie.
[41:34.910 --> 41:38.210]  Your nose looks like it's generating the Walkie Talkie Man video.
[41:40.070 --> 41:44.270]  Yeah, it is your normal face, but you don't normally have that faucet of hair going.
[41:46.350 --> 41:50.450]  Okay, Gavin, how long does it take for you to fill a beard with that nostril flow?
[41:51.010 --> 41:52.430]  I got a four-minute face.
[41:52.570 --> 41:53.650]  You got a four-minute face?
[41:53.810 --> 41:54.830]  You got a four-minute beard.
[41:55.630 --> 41:58.230]  Do you have a lot of nightmares, Gavin, or is this a new thing?
[41:58.830 --> 41:59.530]  It's pretty new.
[42:00.250 --> 42:02.730]  Do you often remember them when you have them?
[42:03.490 --> 42:04.610]  Yeah, if they wake me up.
[42:04.610 --> 42:08.350]  I feel like they typically do wake me up because it's always as I'm getting pounced on or murdered.
[42:08.730 --> 42:09.050]  Yeah.
[42:09.590 --> 42:12.390]  Are you saying, Andrew, that you just sit there and get murdered and don't wake up?
[42:12.850 --> 42:13.790]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do.
[42:14.590 --> 42:16.270]  Andrew, in his dream, his ankle hurts.
[42:17.530 --> 42:19.810]  He's like, nah, I can't go anywhere.
[42:20.210 --> 42:23.350]  I typically just reset the dream after that happens.
[42:23.990 --> 42:24.150]  Oh.
[42:25.350 --> 42:26.190]  I don't know if I talk about...
[42:26.190 --> 42:29.230]  Maybe, because people say if you die in a dream, you die in real life.
[42:29.230 --> 42:34.010]  Maybe that you dies in the dream and then you just go to a new timeline.
[42:34.930 --> 42:35.330]  Maybe.
[42:36.210 --> 42:38.550]  That might be the best people say I've ever heard.
[42:38.970 --> 42:41.770]  People say if you die in a dream, you die for real.
[42:42.290 --> 42:42.770]  They do.
[42:43.290 --> 42:43.910]  What people?
[42:44.570 --> 42:45.810]  The people that say those things.
[42:46.370 --> 42:48.910]  I've heard if you die in the game, you die for real.
[42:49.470 --> 42:50.190]  I've heard that too.
[42:50.630 --> 42:52.230]  I don't think I've heard it if you die in the dream.
[42:52.730 --> 42:53.770]  Well, I'm a little bit older than you.
[42:53.990 --> 42:54.590]  Yeah, you're right.
[42:55.490 --> 42:59.210]  I always thought it made sense that if you die in the Matrix, you died in your chair.
[42:59.210 --> 43:00.110]  Plugged into the Matrix.
[43:00.330 --> 43:02.650]  But I never understood how he got like a bloody lip.
[43:03.530 --> 43:05.570]  He probably bumped that on something.
[43:07.150 --> 43:08.290]  He's thrashing around.
[43:09.590 --> 43:10.470]  Maybe bit it.
[43:11.370 --> 43:12.770]  He could have bit it, I guess.
[43:13.270 --> 43:17.010]  You ever see the footage of when they shut down the Matrix MMO?
[43:17.690 --> 43:19.130]  What happened with all the people?
[43:20.130 --> 43:20.370]  No.
[43:20.650 --> 43:23.170]  I remember that mess in that game.
[43:23.510 --> 43:23.790]  Yeah.
[43:24.870 --> 43:30.310]  There's a great clip of when they shut down the servers, they had everybody die within the universe.
[43:30.490 --> 43:31.950]  And they like fold into themselves.
[43:33.190 --> 43:34.210]  They like crumble.
[43:34.550 --> 43:35.950]  They like ball up.
[43:36.610 --> 43:38.710]  So it's like footage of a bunch of people keeling over?
[43:39.090 --> 43:39.490]  Yes.
[43:40.290 --> 43:42.770]  Like they're eaten by their own assholes kind of thing?
[43:42.910 --> 43:45.730]  Let me see if I can find it on YouTube.
[43:46.410 --> 43:47.190]  I've got it. Hang on.
[43:47.610 --> 43:49.770]  It's insane. It is very disturbing.
[43:50.130 --> 43:52.370]  That should be timestamped as well. 54 seconds.
[43:52.370 --> 43:53.590]  Look at that.
[43:55.650 --> 43:56.450]  Oh lord.
[43:56.790 --> 43:58.930]  That is how that game ended.
[43:59.510 --> 44:01.350]  Everyone got forced into that position.
[44:01.690 --> 44:02.830]  God. Ew.
[44:03.750 --> 44:06.710]  And they made it to do that? Or that's just how it happened?
[44:07.210 --> 44:09.730]  Yes. That's how they, I think, programmed. I assume that was intentional.
[44:11.070 --> 44:13.390]  And what are the exclamation points? Are those people still alive?
[44:14.750 --> 44:15.330]  I don't know.
[44:15.390 --> 44:17.610]  Just twisted into horrific figures?
[44:17.610 --> 44:19.290]  Because that's not even in the Matrix, right?
[44:19.330 --> 44:21.570]  That's not a thing that happens in any of those movies.
[44:21.570 --> 44:24.770]  No, they turned those people into pretzels.
[44:25.270 --> 44:27.310]  The Matrix games did some weird shit.
[44:28.570 --> 44:29.050]  In great ways.
[44:29.250 --> 44:30.810]  That was the Sims, when people got in a fight.
[44:32.170 --> 44:35.570]  You could delete the cloud that was covering them and they would kind of look like that.
[44:35.970 --> 44:37.050]  I think it's...
[44:37.050 --> 44:39.710]  Two people still alive, standing there looking at all their dead friends.
[44:40.410 --> 44:45.710]  I think it's the Path of Neo game, where when you get to the last boss fight,
[44:45.990 --> 44:49.890]  it just stops the fight and a blue and pink cube come out,
[44:49.890 --> 44:53.130]  representing the Wachowskis, and they just say to you,
[44:53.530 --> 44:57.050]  yeah, this is not at all how the story is going to go in the movie,
[44:57.330 --> 45:00.350]  but the movie ending would be boring for a game,
[45:00.710 --> 45:03.670]  so we've just designed this fight for the game specifically.
[45:04.010 --> 45:08.250]  They explain the narrative of it, and then they resume you back into the Matrix.
[45:08.850 --> 45:09.370]  Very weird.
[45:11.970 --> 45:14.550]  The Matrix always had pretty cool outside of movie stuff.
[45:15.250 --> 45:16.790]  And then you fight a giant...
[45:16.790 --> 45:19.870]  A giant Agent Smith, made out of...
[45:19.870 --> 45:21.870]  buildings and cars and stuff.
[45:22.510 --> 45:23.810]  It's so dumb.
[45:23.990 --> 45:26.230]  And I think it's great that they just went,
[45:26.310 --> 45:28.070]  I don't give a fuck about this, it doesn't matter.
[45:28.550 --> 45:32.290]  What was that game...
[45:32.950 --> 45:35.670]  where you roll around a ball and pick stuff up?
[45:35.990 --> 45:36.510]  Katamari.
[45:38.910 --> 45:40.930]  So it's like a Katamari Agent Smith?
[45:42.850 --> 45:44.070]  Yeah, essentially.
[45:45.290 --> 45:48.430]  It's what they interpreted as what video game people would want.
[45:48.930 --> 45:50.050]  And I think that's great.
[45:50.630 --> 45:52.270]  It's nice they were honest about it.
[45:53.350 --> 45:59.190]  It's the only game that I've ever played where they stop the game to explain to you why you're about to do the thing.
[45:59.630 --> 46:02.310]  Like in a way of talking to you as the player.
[46:02.930 --> 46:03.690]  What are those ants?
[46:03.990 --> 46:06.890]  Yeah, you also fight giant fire ants.
[46:07.950 --> 46:10.090]  Yeah, it's not like a good game, it's just sort of like,
[46:10.210 --> 46:12.750]  they went, yeah, this is fucking stupid, let's just do this.
[46:12.790 --> 46:15.090]  I feel like this is a game Eric remembers very well.
[46:15.090 --> 46:19.170]  No, I just remember, it's stuff like that in like the Fight Club video game,
[46:19.210 --> 46:21.670]  where you can be like Fred Durst and Abe Lincoln and stuff.
[46:21.830 --> 46:25.490]  Like, you know, just weird video game shit is a lot of fun.
[46:25.850 --> 46:30.210]  What was the Matrix game where you played as like a ghost in Niobe,
[46:30.430 --> 46:31.650]  and there was like a hacking thing?
[46:33.230 --> 46:35.570]  It was like a parallel to the second movie.
[46:35.790 --> 46:37.150]  Evolutions, I want to say?
[46:37.530 --> 46:38.230]  Or Revolutions?
[46:39.250 --> 46:40.310]  That was the third movie.
[46:40.910 --> 46:43.010]  That was Assassin's Creed game.
[46:43.610 --> 46:43.970]  Revolutions.
[46:45.950 --> 46:48.470]  Are you thinking about Assassin's Creed, maybe?
[46:48.890 --> 46:49.890]  Was it Enter the Matrix?
[46:50.590 --> 46:51.810]  Enter the Matrix, that was it.
[46:51.830 --> 46:52.970]  Just Enter the Matrix, yeah.
[46:53.810 --> 46:54.890]  Yeah, I remember liking that.
[46:55.310 --> 46:56.550]  It's just all bullet time.
[46:57.150 --> 46:58.610]  Yeah, exactly, which is cool.
[46:59.050 --> 47:00.070]  It's all the cool things.
[47:00.410 --> 47:04.110]  But also, they shot stuff for it at the same time they shot the movie,
[47:04.230 --> 47:05.670]  which must have been so expensive.
[47:06.390 --> 47:06.670]  Yes.
[47:08.070 --> 47:11.850]  Maybe someday, if we ever are in a company that plays video games,
[47:11.850 --> 47:14.270]  we can go back and visit those games and run through them.
[47:14.790 --> 47:15.910]  I have zero memory of that.
[47:16.790 --> 47:17.190]  They're great games.
[47:17.410 --> 47:17.670]  Did you play it?
[47:17.890 --> 47:18.650]  I probably did.
[47:18.790 --> 47:22.150]  At that time, it was like, there were so many video games,
[47:22.170 --> 47:23.770]  and we had access to so many video games,
[47:23.810 --> 47:27.070]  and you were playing everything for like an hour back in those days, I feel like.
[47:27.550 --> 47:29.070]  Just a lot of stuff didn't stick with me,
[47:29.470 --> 47:30.810]  because we were burning through so much shit.
[47:33.370 --> 47:35.890]  I don't know that this is a super rich vein to tap here,
[47:35.950 --> 47:37.910]  as we're getting kind of like close to time and everything,
[47:37.910 --> 47:41.650]  but Gracie said that she's never had deja vu,
[47:41.770 --> 47:42.990]  and it pisses her off.
[47:43.690 --> 47:43.950]  What?
[47:44.370 --> 47:46.030]  You've never had deja vu?
[47:46.670 --> 47:47.490]  No, never.
[47:48.030 --> 47:48.910]  Have you just not been alive?
[47:48.910 --> 47:50.190]  It actually drives me crazy.
[47:50.530 --> 47:50.910]  I don't...
[47:53.110 --> 47:58.130]  I looked up why some people don't have it,
[47:59.030 --> 48:02.350]  and it says that my brain is actually functioning more normally
[48:02.350 --> 48:03.870]  than everyone else's for a longer period of time.
[48:03.870 --> 48:04.530]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:04.650 --> 48:07.390]  Do you know the shared common experience that we all have
[48:07.390 --> 48:08.230]  that you don't?
[48:08.330 --> 48:10.050]  Yeah, yeah, you're more normal than us.
[48:10.230 --> 48:12.910]  Do you by any chance have difficulty with captchas?
[48:14.030 --> 48:14.530]  No.
[48:15.150 --> 48:15.950]  Are you a robot?
[48:16.890 --> 48:17.410]  Yes.
[48:19.170 --> 48:21.690]  What is the youngest anyone's had deja vu?
[48:23.110 --> 48:25.130]  I mean, I definitely had it as a kid.
[48:25.470 --> 48:29.110]  Yeah, I remember having it at like nine years old
[48:29.110 --> 48:31.650]  and thinking it was like the craziest feeling in the world.
[48:32.430 --> 48:35.490]  Like, I don't even know what the feeling is.
[48:35.490 --> 48:37.130]  Everyone tries to describe it to me,
[48:37.690 --> 48:40.510]  and I can't wrap my mind around it because I've never had it.
[48:41.010 --> 48:43.530]  Maybe you do have it, but it feels differently to you
[48:43.530 --> 48:45.230]  and you just don't recognize it as that.
[48:45.310 --> 48:46.370]  You think it's something else.
[48:46.490 --> 48:48.870]  Like, you're like, oh, I'm hungry again, but it's really deja vu.
[48:49.530 --> 48:50.170]  Oh, you know what?
[48:50.290 --> 48:54.710]  We never figured out how long Gracie's tub feels for.
[48:54.930 --> 48:55.710]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:55.730 --> 48:56.490]  Yeah, we should do that.
[48:57.270 --> 48:58.290]  Oh, that's a good call.
[48:59.090 --> 49:00.790]  Okay, so now y'all are trying to induce it.
[49:05.530 --> 49:06.810]  That's what it would feel like.
[49:07.030 --> 49:08.410]  She's definitely a robot.
[49:09.310 --> 49:11.230]  The most normal one of us all.
[49:11.310 --> 49:12.250]  Thank you, Eric, for posting.
[49:13.310 --> 49:15.130]  There she is, the British Jackal.
[49:15.310 --> 49:15.830]  The British Jackal.
[49:15.910 --> 49:16.990]  There she is.
[49:17.250 --> 49:18.790]  The funniest picture.
[49:19.890 --> 49:22.050]  Everyone seems like mad about it.
[49:23.070 --> 49:26.690]  It's like everybody started in photos of their hair going up their nose today.
[49:28.610 --> 49:30.690]  I can't believe no one else could do that.
[49:31.330 --> 49:32.390]  It can't be true.
[49:35.150 --> 49:39.390]  I just told you specifically I trim my mustache so it doesn't do that.
[49:40.210 --> 49:41.530]  That's why you trim it?
[49:42.250 --> 49:42.690]  Yes.
[49:42.910 --> 49:45.270]  I've never had that happen in my life.
[49:45.370 --> 49:49.690]  I've had like a hair go up my nose one time and it tickles and you're like, oh, get rid of that.
[49:49.770 --> 49:56.630]  But I've never had a problem where all my hair has got sucked up into my nostrils and then stayed there long enough.
[49:56.630 --> 49:58.090]  That's never happened to me before.
[49:58.170 --> 50:01.430]  I just happened to push it all up there by accident with the eye mask.
[50:03.170 --> 50:04.790]  I can't push mine up like that.
[50:05.030 --> 50:05.350]  I'm sorry.
[50:05.810 --> 50:08.130]  I'd love to be on your side right now.
[50:08.770 --> 50:11.490]  Gracie had to leave early and she said, OK, I have to leave.
[50:11.550 --> 50:12.590]  Don't talk about cum.
[50:14.630 --> 50:15.670]  I don't think she had to.
[50:15.930 --> 50:17.870]  I mean, that's terrible.
[50:18.550 --> 50:19.270]  Oh, shit, guys.
[50:19.970 --> 50:20.550]  It's raining.
[50:21.850 --> 50:25.510]  Yeah, there's supposed to be there's thunderstorms coming for like the next like two hours.
[50:25.510 --> 50:27.230]  Yeah, I just I just heard one roll through.
[50:27.390 --> 50:29.230]  Is your dog afraid of thunder or not?
[50:29.450 --> 50:30.010]  Find out.
[50:30.210 --> 50:31.470]  I don't think so.
[50:31.630 --> 50:32.770]  I don't think my dog gives a shit.
[50:33.150 --> 50:34.170]  My dog's pretty, pretty chill.
[50:35.050 --> 50:37.350]  Would you rather rain syrup or cum?
[50:38.210 --> 50:39.250]  God damn it.
[50:40.230 --> 50:41.110]  Dude, syrup.
[50:41.710 --> 50:42.530]  I love syrup.
[50:43.150 --> 50:43.510]  Hang on.
[50:43.550 --> 50:43.890]  Hang on.
[50:43.950 --> 50:44.770]  Hang on, Gavin.
[50:47.370 --> 50:48.690]  Gavin, make your choice.
[50:49.550 --> 50:50.370]  Syrup or cum?
[50:54.860 --> 50:55.880]  What do you mean?
[50:56.460 --> 50:57.880]  Well, if it's going to rain.
[50:58.320 --> 50:59.380]  You're already fucked, Gavin.
[50:59.460 --> 51:00.700]  It took way too long for you to answer.
[51:00.880 --> 51:02.220]  The answer was quick and easy.
[51:03.220 --> 51:03.760]  Syrup or cum?
[51:04.180 --> 51:04.680]  Syrup, right?
[51:04.760 --> 51:05.440]  No, no, no, no.
[51:05.460 --> 51:05.920]  It's too late.
[51:06.040 --> 51:07.040]  Yeah, no, you don't even know.
[51:07.300 --> 51:08.860]  What do you mean right?
[51:09.260 --> 51:10.420]  What do you mean right?
[51:13.860 --> 51:15.080]  What do you put on your pancakes?
[51:16.080 --> 51:17.060]  Oh, you don't want to know.
[51:18.440 --> 51:19.720]  I'm sinking in the rain.
[51:20.660 --> 51:21.300]  Oh, man.
[51:21.900 --> 51:22.220]  Gavin.
[51:25.640 --> 51:27.200]  Cloudy with a chance of cum.
[51:28.680 --> 51:30.440]  No umbrella for me.
[51:31.320 --> 51:32.940]  Cloudy with a chance of my balls.
[51:39.610 --> 51:41.830]  Raindrops keep falling on my head.
[51:47.930 --> 51:50.250]  We've got to pay Grayson to stay in the fold.
[51:50.450 --> 51:50.690]  I want to know.
[51:51.490 --> 51:54.630]  Have you ever seen the cum?
[51:56.770 --> 51:57.650]  Oh, fuck.
[51:57.710 --> 51:59.350]  The next line is cumming down.
[52:01.010 --> 52:02.310]  Oh, my God.
[52:03.770 --> 52:04.850]  Yeah, we need to...
[52:04.850 --> 52:07.030]  Yeah, Gracie has to be here all the time more often
[52:07.030 --> 52:07.930]  because this is not good.
[52:10.830 --> 52:12.350]  I still can't get over that picture.
[52:12.470 --> 52:14.790]  That's the weirdest choice.
[52:15.490 --> 52:16.790]  We should talk about it some more.
[52:17.030 --> 52:18.170]  Why did she do that?
[52:18.390 --> 52:21.290]  There was an easy way to do this whole thing.
[52:21.650 --> 52:23.530]  There's an easy way to do this whole thing.
[52:23.530 --> 52:25.410]  It's the weirdest photo.
[52:25.550 --> 52:26.670]  Why did she do that?
[52:26.670 --> 52:27.430]  It's so troubled.
[52:27.670 --> 52:29.170]  It's like aggressively troubled.
[52:31.130 --> 52:32.170]  Oh, my God.
[52:32.490 --> 52:35.430]  I want to put it on a shirt, but we can't.
[52:35.470 --> 52:36.310]  We don't have...
[52:36.310 --> 52:36.990]  We can't.
[52:37.290 --> 52:38.670]  There's no shirt to put it on.
[52:38.950 --> 52:41.670]  Because by the time this is all out and done or whatever,
[52:41.830 --> 52:43.750]  we can't do this.
[52:43.910 --> 52:44.450]  There's nothing.
[52:44.530 --> 52:46.050]  There's no shop to put it in.
[52:46.390 --> 52:47.890]  Here's what we do.
[52:47.990 --> 52:49.330]  When we start the new thing,
[52:49.450 --> 52:51.330]  at some point, there'll be merch, right?
[52:51.330 --> 52:52.730]  We'll have...
[52:52.730 --> 52:54.210]  We'll Taylor Swift this photo.
[52:54.810 --> 52:54.970]  Yeah.
[52:56.350 --> 53:00.770]  I think we got to put the British Jackal in the regulation vault.
[53:01.550 --> 53:02.570]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[53:03.210 --> 53:03.730]  100%.
[53:03.730 --> 53:04.630]  100%.
[53:04.630 --> 53:05.410]  I mean...
[53:05.410 --> 53:05.790]  Oh, man.
[53:05.970 --> 53:08.350]  We've turned around some print on demands pretty fast.
[53:09.090 --> 53:09.630]  Yeah, but...
[53:09.630 --> 53:10.330]  This ain't happening.
[53:11.170 --> 53:12.330]  But the last...
[53:12.850 --> 53:13.350]  But the...
[53:13.350 --> 53:14.630]  I think that the...
[53:14.630 --> 53:16.230]  Like, our last sale...
[53:16.230 --> 53:17.630]  At the time of the recording...
[53:17.630 --> 53:17.890]  Oh!
[53:17.950 --> 53:19.390]  It's the 27th.
[53:19.390 --> 53:23.190]  The 29th is our last sale ever,
[53:23.370 --> 53:24.550]  and they're shutting down...
[53:24.550 --> 53:27.490]  I think they're fire-sailing everything on the 1st.
[53:27.510 --> 53:30.170]  I think April 1st, they're stopping print-on-demand stuff.
[53:30.390 --> 53:31.210]  Yeah, yeah.
[53:31.310 --> 53:32.470]  So, by the time this is out,
[53:32.570 --> 53:33.550]  which will be...
[53:33.550 --> 53:33.810]  What?
[53:33.870 --> 53:34.130]  Two weeks?
[53:34.230 --> 53:37.090]  Like, April 10th or whatever when this comes out?
[53:37.310 --> 53:37.550]  You know?
[53:37.710 --> 53:38.590]  Like, it'll be long done.
[53:38.770 --> 53:38.990]  Sorry.
[53:39.090 --> 53:40.130]  What happened to all them clocks?
[53:41.630 --> 53:44.650]  I think they got put back in the store and then bought by other people.
[53:45.110 --> 53:48.050]  I got about 600 of them propping up the left side of my house right now.
[53:48.050 --> 53:50.370]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[53:50.370 --> 53:51.110]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[53:51.110 --> 53:51.730]  Oh, man.
[53:53.190 --> 53:54.890]  Okay, remember that line, Geoff.
[53:54.910 --> 53:56.910]  And then say it next time you see Nick in person.
[53:57.430 --> 53:58.570]  Because that was a good one.
[53:58.870 --> 53:59.790]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah!
[54:00.010 --> 54:00.950]  That got a good reaction.
[54:02.670 --> 54:04.390]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[54:04.390 --> 54:06.150]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[54:06.290 --> 54:06.710]  All right.
[54:06.830 --> 54:07.110]  All right.
[54:07.910 --> 54:09.410]  Everybody excited about...
[54:09.410 --> 54:10.710]  I'm going to date this recording,
[54:10.830 --> 54:12.910]  but is everybody excited about the baseball season starting tomorrow?
[54:14.530 --> 54:14.950]  Yeah.
[54:15.470 --> 54:16.710]  Baseball season starting tomorrow?
[54:16.710 --> 54:18.850]  That was an interesting response from Nick.
[54:19.490 --> 54:22.010]  Yeah, yeah. Opening opening day is tomorrow.
[54:22.190 --> 54:23.690]  The Phillies game was already delayed, Geoff.
[54:24.310 --> 54:26.070]  Was it really? Why?
[54:26.590 --> 54:29.410]  Yeah, the every team was supposed to play tomorrow.
[54:30.070 --> 54:31.310]  It was going to be like what?
[54:31.350 --> 54:32.750]  Like a big kickoff for baseball.
[54:32.870 --> 54:34.230]  And they had to delay some games. Yep.
[54:35.030 --> 54:36.290]  For weather or what?
[54:36.770 --> 54:38.210]  I think so. I think so. Yeah.
[54:39.550 --> 54:40.690]  What was on the weather report?
[54:41.390 --> 54:42.310]  You don't want to know.
[54:42.630 --> 54:44.810]  It's coming. It's coming down. It's bad.
[54:46.710 --> 54:47.790]  They say, don't look up.
[54:51.570 --> 54:53.210]  Oh, my God.
[54:53.950 --> 54:56.070]  Trying to catch a cum angel with my tongue.
[54:56.570 --> 54:57.810]  I just need to know.
[54:59.250 --> 55:03.070]  Well, I'm going to be making hot dogs and watching baseball.
[55:03.190 --> 55:04.790]  The American pastime.
[55:06.950 --> 55:10.070]  Brought us the likes of Pedro Martinez and Don Zimmer.
[55:10.870 --> 55:15.630]  I'm going to continue in the pastiche, the rich tradition of the
[55:15.630 --> 55:20.650]  all-American sport of baseball, hot dogs and Cracker Jacks.
[55:21.390 --> 55:22.510]  The old ball game.
[55:23.310 --> 55:24.490]  What about peanuts?
[55:25.270 --> 55:26.590]  Peanuts have to be in the mix, right?
[55:27.050 --> 55:27.730]  I'll have some peanuts.
[55:29.390 --> 55:30.970]  Any other things in that song?
[55:34.370 --> 55:35.970]  Stop trying to gamify everything.
[55:36.370 --> 55:40.530]  Yeah, I was going to say, yeah, I think Gavin's just trying to run out the clock here.
[55:40.710 --> 55:41.210]  He's smart.
[55:43.890 --> 55:46.990]  I can let Nick is losing it in this episode.
[55:48.530 --> 55:50.610]  I have a question for everybody.
[55:51.030 --> 55:54.450]  Oh, yeah, I was thinking about, you know, how like you have subscription,
[55:54.610 --> 55:58.190]  everything's a subscription service now and you have subscription services.
[55:58.330 --> 56:00.130]  You forget that you're even paying for it sometimes.
[56:00.710 --> 56:03.370]  Again, you had Xbox Live for like a year on a wrong account.
[56:04.330 --> 56:05.270]  Three years, but three years.
[56:06.770 --> 56:08.670]  Well, yeah, listen, I was trying to do you a favor.
[56:08.670 --> 56:16.830]  Um, if you viewed every part of your body, if it was every part was a subscription service.
[56:17.110 --> 56:19.050]  Are there things you would unsubscribe to?
[56:19.590 --> 56:20.870]  Oh, yeah.
[56:21.230 --> 56:22.710]  What are you unsubscribing to, Geoff?
[56:22.730 --> 56:23.610]  My butthole.
[56:24.170 --> 56:26.990]  So you would just continue to fill with waste?
[56:27.210 --> 56:27.730]  So you just store shit?
[56:28.130 --> 56:30.290]  I just wouldn't poop anymore because you wouldn't need it.
[56:31.090 --> 56:32.010]  You're not going to eat?
[56:35.140 --> 56:37.020]  You don't eat because of your butt.
[56:37.540 --> 56:42.680]  In this in this magic world where I can opt out of having parts of my body,
[56:42.860 --> 56:46.520]  I'm opting out of collecting waste at the same world is not that magical.
[56:46.840 --> 56:49.540]  I would opt out of like my ring finger, maybe on one hand,
[56:49.620 --> 56:51.720]  if it was expensive and I could do without it.
[56:52.060 --> 56:54.640]  I'm getting rid of my my pinkies.
[56:54.940 --> 56:56.260]  I'm not paying for those.
[56:56.400 --> 56:57.440]  Don't you need a pinky?
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.000]  Why do I need a pinky?
[56:59.800 --> 57:01.140]  It's you need the end ones.
[57:01.280 --> 57:02.080]  You'll find out real fast.
[57:02.100 --> 57:03.880]  They're like bookends for the rest of your fingers.
[57:03.880 --> 57:08.120]  You think the pinkies is more what are you going to grow a cocaine nail?
[57:08.520 --> 57:11.800]  Yeah. How are you going to dig a little tiny bit of earwax out of your ear?
[57:13.440 --> 57:15.400]  I got small hands, I can use any finger for that.
[57:15.580 --> 57:16.300]  That's I'm all good.
[57:16.600 --> 57:18.320]  How are you going to count to five?
[57:19.440 --> 57:21.140]  But fuck, I got two hands.
[57:21.680 --> 57:23.100]  It's really 10 would be the problem.
[57:23.720 --> 57:25.180]  Yeah, I'm going to type in an L.
[57:26.600 --> 57:28.420]  I think I don't think I use.
[57:28.640 --> 57:29.760]  No, I don't. I know.
[57:30.440 --> 57:33.140]  How do you get a tab or shift?
[57:33.140 --> 57:34.960]  I don't do shift already.
[57:35.600 --> 57:37.080]  How do you run in a video game?
[57:37.700 --> 57:38.580]  I my thumbs.
[57:38.980 --> 57:39.920]  What do you mean?
[57:40.000 --> 57:40.920]  Well, he claws it.
[57:41.440 --> 57:42.780]  He's he's a weird claw.
[57:43.500 --> 57:47.240]  Well, I mean, you use your pinky to hit all your buttons on the right side.
[57:48.080 --> 57:48.700]  No, I don't.
[57:49.160 --> 57:49.720]  What do you use?
[57:50.060 --> 57:51.620]  I use my middle finger.
[57:52.120 --> 57:54.740]  My middle finger covers my bumper and my right shoulder.
[57:54.900 --> 57:55.640]  You're right. You're right.
[57:56.080 --> 58:00.400]  And then, OK, so how much money would you have to save to warrant
[58:00.400 --> 58:01.800]  losing the little fingers?
[58:02.240 --> 58:03.740]  Honestly, three dollars each.
[58:03.840 --> 58:05.200]  They're gone. They're both gone.
[58:05.540 --> 58:08.540]  So you would make six bucks a month and not have fingers.
[58:09.140 --> 58:13.680]  Well, OK, that won't even buy you an extra value meal at McDonald's.
[58:14.060 --> 58:15.440]  Pointless. No, no, no.
[58:15.540 --> 58:16.940]  Give me I'll give you three hundred dollars.
[58:17.040 --> 58:18.040]  Let's chop them off, man.
[58:18.180 --> 58:20.400]  You know, you can resubscribe in this world.
[58:20.540 --> 58:24.340]  I'm saying that I think I'd be willing to drop the subscription for that.
[58:24.620 --> 58:28.420]  If I'm wrong, I'll unsubscribe from everything below my neck at night.
[58:30.020 --> 58:31.040]  Well, you die.
[58:32.940 --> 58:34.200]  Those are vital organs.
[58:35.160 --> 58:40.540]  OK, can I can I be like the Robocop remake where I'm just like a spine
[58:40.540 --> 58:41.500]  and like one lung?
[58:43.520 --> 58:47.960]  And yes, if you can figure it out the other way, could you subscribe to extra shit?
[58:48.140 --> 58:49.920]  Like, can I have extra fingers if I wanted to?
[58:50.080 --> 58:51.260]  Now we're talking.
[58:51.720 --> 58:52.900]  I'm into this.
[58:53.080 --> 58:54.220]  I'm putting a cock on my back.
[58:54.400 --> 58:57.800]  Like, yeah, can I pay like an extra thirteen dollars to have
[58:58.500 --> 58:59.980]  three elbows or something?
[59:00.600 --> 59:01.620]  Sure. Why not?
[59:01.820 --> 59:02.660]  Want more elbows?
[59:03.240 --> 59:04.800]  I want a prehensile tail.
[59:05.580 --> 59:08.600]  I would want more elbows if I was going to be like a UFC fighter.
[59:08.960 --> 59:11.780]  Would it go on like the forearm side or on the bicep side?
[59:12.140 --> 59:14.460]  I think it would go on top of the other elbow.
[59:15.800 --> 59:16.760]  What? What?
[59:17.000 --> 59:18.900]  Like elbow stacking on both sides.
[59:19.440 --> 59:22.480]  So you just have like a growth on your elbow.
[59:22.700 --> 59:24.580]  They wouldn't hinge anything.
[59:24.940 --> 59:26.900]  It would be so strong and hard.
[59:26.900 --> 59:28.540]  You could fucking whack people with it.
[59:28.580 --> 59:29.520]  So it'd be awesome.
[59:29.720 --> 59:30.880]  You're just talking about an upgrade.
[59:30.980 --> 59:32.200]  You're not talking about like an addition.
[59:32.760 --> 59:34.100]  No, it is an addition.
[59:34.260 --> 59:36.060]  It's two that are stacked on top of each other.
[59:36.280 --> 59:37.580]  Take me off at 200 percent.
[59:37.800 --> 59:39.020]  Yeah, get them off 200 percent.
[59:39.960 --> 59:40.820]  I wish I could.
[59:40.900 --> 59:43.640]  I wish I could rent extra fingers right now to flip you off with.
[59:45.480 --> 59:47.480]  Yeah, but I wouldn't recognize it as the middle finger.
[59:47.660 --> 59:48.340]  Yeah, you wouldn't.
[59:48.540 --> 59:49.980]  How would that work?
[59:50.360 --> 59:51.600]  You would have side fingers.
[59:51.980 --> 59:54.220]  It would have to be one middle finger coming out of your forehead.
[59:54.360 --> 59:55.940]  And that would that would probably do it.
[59:55.940 --> 59:56.460]  That's totally fine.
[59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.240]  I think you would have to have all the five fingers that they are.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:05.120]  And then and then like where your middle finger is a finger on your palm
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.900]  and then a finger on the back of your hand.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.520]  And so when you bend them all down, you have one true middle finger.
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.700]  And it's very powerful.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:16.000]  I could do that, but I could also put it on my forehead
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.740]  and it could be my fuck unicorn.
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:25.400]  What do you think is the least like the part you could get rid of
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.860]  and not notice the most?
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:27.560]  Appendix.
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:31.100]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.840]  Could I get a second blood?
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:34.740]  A second blood?
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:41.100]  Like imagine a pouch on my back that contains a human body's worth of blood
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.720]  that I can just sub in.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.640]  You want a blood bag on your back?
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.880]  Yeah, so I can just give myself a transfusion if I need it.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.160]  Just in the rare case you need it, or is it so you can do like drugs
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.280]  and then pass a test?
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.040]  No, it would be.
[01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:58.520]  It'd be like a backup fuel tank.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.640]  Oh, like I could just switch the thing and it would just start pumping in.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.720]  If my blood goes bad.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:08.960]  I fuck I'd rather instead of that, I'd rather have a backup bladder on my back.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.000]  So if I get caught out somewhere and it's hard, I can't piss.
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.140]  I could just dump all the pee into the backup bladder
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.520]  and then clear out my first bladder.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.340]  It would suck if you took a baseball to the back, though,
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.860]  and your bladder exploded away.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.440]  What would be worse, getting covered in your old piss
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.660]  or getting covered in your extra blood if your blood bag popped?
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.120]  It'd be gross either way.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:30.180]  I'd rather be covered in blood than piss.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.340]  I guess if it's my blood, I'd be pretty fucking scared if I was covered in my blood.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.720]  Piss is piss, though.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.260]  Piss is supposed to be on the outside.
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.440]  Blood's supposed to be on the inside.
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:44.840]  I think I could take a shower and get the piss off.
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.200]  If I take a shower and get the blood off, I'm like, don't go down the drain.
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.200]  I still need that blood.
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.620]  Well, you could remake it.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:51.700]  You generate new blood.
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:53.980]  You could just start refilling very slowly.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.420]  You generate blood way slower than you generate piss.
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.000]  Now, a week later, I'd have a full blood bag again.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:01:59.960]  Probably two weeks.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:01.240]  Two weeks.
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:03.880]  I don't think I don't think you're generating that much blood that quickly.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.820]  So how long does it take to generate a body's worth of blood?
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.400]  Hold on a second.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.240]  How long does it take to generate a body's worth of blood?
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.580]  Probably need blood to start generating blood.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:17.360]  I'm sure they've got a math equation.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.080]  Are you telling me that Mark Hominik didn't have a hematoma?
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.500]  He was just storing a blood bag.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.100]  He had a second blood bag ready to go.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.180]  Oh, my God. Fuck, I forgot about that.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.680]  How long does it take for the body to make new blood?
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.100]  If you donate a pint of blood, it takes about four to six weeks
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.780]  to complete replacement. Oh, my God.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.600]  Didn't they? Was it?
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.440]  Who was it? George Washington?
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:43.180]  They just like sucked four pints of his blood out or something.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.200]  Didn't they like let a bunch of blood?
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:49.200]  Was that because he chopped down a cherry tree, right?
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.040]  That was his punishment?
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:51.900]  I don't know.
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:54.440]  Who can remember American history, right?
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:55.280]  Confusing.
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.980]  I just remember, like, doctors used to kill presidents a lot.
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:04.940]  Like, one president got shot and then they killed him by rummaging around
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:06.460]  with their bare hands in his gut.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.480]  I mean, it wasn't just presidents. Those were the good doctors, by the way.
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:13.120]  Doctors killed a lot of people a lot back in the old days.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.100]  It was a lot of like, well, let's see what this does.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:20.780]  I always think about the the drunk history for when the on the one
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:23.680]  about the president who had the least like longest run.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.660]  I think he died in 28 days and he got sick.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.980]  He got like a cold and like pneumonia and a clip of him just going in.
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.520]  The doctors didn't know anything.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.580]  And so they just threw leeches and snakes on him.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.860]  So let him bite you and make you feel better.
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:39.980]  And that is my in my head.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:43.760]  The old timey doctor is throwing snakes on people.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.720]  That was the way.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:47.540]  And they also didn't believe in anything that was like invisible, like.
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:49.680]  Microbes and bacteria.
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.460]  Yeah, it was William Harry Henderson.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:57.260]  If I'm ill and the solution is for a snake to bite me better,
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.200]  I need you guys to kill me in the room on the spot.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:05.400]  What if the snake is in my mouth and I bite you?
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.400]  And then while I'm biting you, the snake bites you.
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:08.340]  So you never see the snake.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:09.400]  Oh, like a xenomorph?
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:13.460]  No, I appreciate the sentiment, but I can't.
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.780]  The knowledge alone of even the idea of a snake.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.940]  The idea that a snake exists is bad enough.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.560]  I just I couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:28.260]  What if Gavin subscribes to the life saving thing the snake has
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.540]  and then he bites you snake style?
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.140]  I'll subscribe to some glands and a fan.
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.440]  Yeah, I can do that. I can do that.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.420]  You can do that. OK.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:41.040]  So Gavin snake is if it's Gavin biting me and not a snake mouth, I can do it.
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:42.320]  Where am I biting you there?
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.600]  Yeah, it's going to have to be a wiener.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.940]  It's the only way to save me.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.380]  I would say it's the ass because it's so fleshy.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.920]  But I mean, it's up to you.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.380]  Yeah, it's either the ass or the wiener.
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.700]  Have you guys thought about that?
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.020]  No, we have to end.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:56.900]  We have to go.
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.040]  I would have been done if you didn't interrupt.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.440]  I would have been finished.
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.720]  I don't I don't believe that.
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.480]  I was six words away.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.880]  It's been two hundred episodes, Andrew, no fucking shot.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:08.160]  Here's your final six words.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.080]  Take us out, Andrew.
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:11.860]  Go fuck yourself, Eric.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.300]  It's only five words.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.720]  We'll see you next time.
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:17.900]  Bye.
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:18.680]  Hey, guys.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:22.000]  Major League fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of Face.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.660]  And once again, the boys are behind schedule.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.400]  So with only a few episodes left, here are more predictions.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.440]  Geoff had secrets in the store.
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.180]  We have our first graded pin.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.240]  Jim meant ten.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.980]  Gavin made a Gracie meme.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.440]  We have a new favorite sport.
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.440]  Did Nick wear the monkey mask?
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:38.940]  Who didn't survive the eclipse?
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:41.460]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:44.160]  All that and more on next week's episode of Face.
