[00:10.420 --> 00:16.640]  Hello. Hey, what's up? What is happening? Well, this is weird. Uh... What's going on? What do we do?
[00:18.080 --> 00:23.560]  I don't... I mean, we have to wait. I think we give him 45 seconds and then we just call it.
[00:23.780 --> 00:28.620]  Call? What does that mean, call it? Like, don't do the episode? What does call it mean?
[00:29.620 --> 00:35.480]  Do we have another episode in the can? No. No? Then we gotta, we gotta go. Yeah, we have to.
[00:36.040 --> 00:40.360]  I don't have a choice. Nick isn't here also. There's no Andrew. I don't really understand
[00:40.360 --> 00:47.280]  what's going on. I feel like we might need Andrew. I would say at the very least, yes.
[00:47.980 --> 00:52.020]  There we go. All right, you ready? I'm on time. Well, there's no way he's ready and recording.
[00:52.720 --> 00:58.760]  I'm already recording. Go. All right. That tone is not... Oh, whatever. Just start.
[00:59.720 --> 01:06.360]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast. I believe this is the
[01:07.160 --> 01:14.340]  203rd iteration of this carnival of stupidity and cum we call a podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:14.440 --> 01:20.440]  With me as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free. How's everybody doing? Pretty good.
[01:21.400 --> 01:28.220]  Fantastic. Why on earth were you late? I was on time. What do you mean?
[01:29.160 --> 01:35.880]  You were... I was one. I was one when I was here. That's fair. You were within the 60 second grace
[01:35.880 --> 01:42.220]  period. I was within the 60 second grace period. Why on earth were you on time? Better question.
[01:42.940 --> 01:48.220]  Why was I early? I had to use the bathroom and it was a bigger ordeal than I was anticipating.
[01:48.720 --> 01:54.820]  So you traded pleasantries for what I assume was a liquid shit.
[01:56.080 --> 02:02.620]  No, it was just more. I thought I just had to pee and there was more. It was a combo
[02:02.620 --> 02:06.940]  when I thought I was getting an individual item and it took more time than I anticipated.
[02:08.420 --> 02:11.760]  So were you panic wiping? There's no way you've done a good job.
[02:12.480 --> 02:17.380]  No, I listened. I was thorough. The job was done clean. But yeah, I was definitely...
[02:18.300 --> 02:23.080]  Actually, I had a slow-mo guys TikTok running and I was like, I got four more rotations of Gavin
[02:23.540 --> 02:29.820]  before I got to go. I got to hurry. Well, I appreciate the views. You're welcome. Yeah,
[02:30.080 --> 02:34.400]  I just listen. It's going to be my algorithm. Have you ever filmed somebody shitting with a
[02:34.400 --> 02:40.240]  phantom? No, Gavin. No, it's not. It's not that fast unless you've really got. It'd still be
[02:40.240 --> 02:44.420]  interesting to see in slow motion, wouldn't it? No, don't do a human. Maybe do like a dog. Then
[02:44.420 --> 02:50.660]  it would feel more scientific. Why did before you finished asking the question, why did Andrew
[02:50.660 --> 02:57.020]  answer? If somebody is asking to the group, have you filmed someone shitting? I think it's
[02:57.020 --> 03:02.080]  important to declare no. It doesn't matter if it was aimed at you or not. I want it to be clear.
[03:02.400 --> 03:12.120]  No. I have not. Yeah, but I was asking Gavin. Yeah, but listen, I'm not really a scat boy.
[03:13.400 --> 03:18.880]  No, but you're like you're into science and fecal matter is just science at the end of the day.
[03:18.880 --> 03:23.480]  That is true. Uh, what isn't science? Exactly.
[03:27.760 --> 03:35.200]  I'd say Garfield. Garfield isn't science. Yes. Science of Garfield. How do you feel? I feel
[03:35.200 --> 03:40.940]  great. Because last time you felt great, but sounded like shit. This time you sound even worse.
[03:41.200 --> 03:45.980]  I think I sound better. I disagree. I think I sound better than I did. You do not. You sound
[03:45.980 --> 03:52.220]  older. You sound like 10 plus years. You sound like you've seen some shit. Well, I have, but I
[03:52.220 --> 03:57.920]  haven't filmed it. You saw it at normal speed, unfortunately. I did. I saw it at normal speed.
[03:58.600 --> 04:06.040]  I think my vocal cords are recovering and I think yelling a lot, screaming when they were bad to
[04:06.040 --> 04:11.400]  show my enthusiasm, maybe wasn't a great idea. Maybe kind of delayed my overall recovery.
[04:11.400 --> 04:16.100]  There was a lot of yelling in general and especially towards Eric last week.
[04:16.240 --> 04:18.760]  See, I don't even remember that. Yeah, it was very rude.
[04:20.440 --> 04:24.780]  You had five more words left in the podcast and you used four.
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.160]  I got to save one for later. You never know when you need a word.
[04:29.380 --> 04:32.380]  Great. Okay. Hey, do we know where Nick is or no?
[04:32.860 --> 04:38.240]  He's dead. Well, okay. He's sick. All right. He's not dead, but he's sick.
[04:38.720 --> 04:41.160]  Is that how you lead that up? He's dead.
[04:44.600 --> 04:49.720]  The death doctor. He's at the mortician. I was actually part of the reason why I was
[04:49.720 --> 04:53.720]  worried about getting here on time is because I told him I wouldn't make sure Craig was here.
[04:54.220 --> 04:57.620]  So I was like, I got to get Craig in. They can't start without Craig.
[04:58.400 --> 05:00.020]  I made a promise to Nick. I did it before you got here.
[05:00.540 --> 05:04.960]  Which is great. Yeah, but he asked me to, so I felt a specific obligation.
[05:04.960 --> 05:08.460]  Do we ever explain what Craig is? I feel like we talk about Craig.
[05:08.840 --> 05:12.400]  I think we have. Yeah. Okay. It's a Discord recorder thing.
[05:12.560 --> 05:14.740]  It's not just Google Craig. And now we have again.
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.220]  Now we've explained it twice. Let's do it every hundred episodes to be said.
[05:20.200 --> 05:24.120]  Hey, let me ask you guys a question that came to me last night.
[05:25.380 --> 05:30.980]  Actually, three of us were hanging out together last night. I won't say which three. We were at a
[05:30.980 --> 05:37.800]  watching a baseball game and I was watching some birds fly over the field and cast shadows.
[05:38.180 --> 05:42.840]  And that got me thinking, how come birds don't have visible balls?
[05:43.380 --> 05:49.240]  Like a boy bird. How come? Like Albert, his balls dropped and his little balls swing every time he
[05:49.240 --> 05:54.760]  walks. Wouldn't it be funny if birds had balls? And like when they dove, the balls hung behind
[05:54.760 --> 05:58.940]  them and like fluttered in the air. And then when they slam on the brakes, the balls shoot forward.
[05:58.940 --> 06:03.920]  Like how come birds don't have... wouldn't it be cooler if birds had balls, like visible balls?
[06:04.140 --> 06:08.400]  With birds evolving to be as aerodynamic as possible, you wouldn't want balls
[06:08.400 --> 06:13.160]  spinning and slapping in the wind. I agree. But wouldn't it be fucking awesome?
[06:13.520 --> 06:18.640]  It would make birds so much more interesting. Those are two separate conversations. I don't
[06:18.640 --> 06:23.760]  think evolution factors in what would be hilarious. Fuck evolution. Evolution made a platypus. How
[06:23.760 --> 06:28.800]  does that make sense? I want balls on my birds. I love the idea of a bird flying up to
[06:28.800 --> 06:32.820]  something and then doing the thing where it like holds its wings up for drag so it can stop.
[06:33.160 --> 06:36.860]  And then the ball's just swinging around and it just does a backflip because it can't stop on time.
[06:37.000 --> 06:43.020]  And then like, think about it, like if you're a snake or like a small rodent and a big bird grabs
[06:43.020 --> 06:47.160]  you and it takes you up into the air and it's like fucking donezo, dude, that you're... it's over for
[06:47.160 --> 06:54.860]  you. You have one last defense. If you can get to the balls, I bet it'll drop you. I feel like it
[06:54.860 --> 06:59.000]  would be a problem with the birds that land on water because fish would constantly be nibbling.
[07:00.700 --> 07:03.560]  Oh yeah, can you imagine? The balls would land before the bird does.
[07:05.960 --> 07:10.020]  Not even nibbling, but you know how like fish will jump out of the water,
[07:10.140 --> 07:14.400]  like going in for a fish and then just getting whacked in the balls over and over again as all
[07:14.400 --> 07:20.500]  the other fish are just coming up. Just like a low pass and your nuts just get a blaring.
[07:21.580 --> 07:24.240]  It would be the worst if you were like a nearsighted bird
[07:24.240 --> 07:31.600]  with big balls is constantly smacking into shit. Do you think it would be too cruel to craft a very
[07:31.600 --> 07:36.560]  small rubber set of testicles and give them to a bird to wear just to see what the aerodynamics
[07:36.560 --> 07:43.020]  would be? That's science. That's sort of... Well, we do know a bird expert. I feel like we could run
[07:43.020 --> 07:47.120]  this. We can run this by them and maybe see. You know what? I'm going to Google it. Do birds have
[07:47.120 --> 07:56.200]  balls? I'm sure they have external balls. Like there's got to be like one now. I mean, think
[07:56.200 --> 08:01.860]  about skydiving with no pants. And that's what you're positing. That's exactly what I'm thinking
[08:01.860 --> 08:07.460]  of. That would be fuck. That's what I want to see. Every time I see a bird, I want to see I want to
[08:07.460 --> 08:11.860]  see a dude skydiving with no pants on. I feel like that would be there are some birds that can go
[08:11.860 --> 08:16.080]  faster than like human terminal velocity. If you had like a falcon with a set of balls,
[08:16.080 --> 08:23.240]  they might just get ripped off. Could a bird castrate itself? Yeah, could a bird outfly its
[08:23.240 --> 08:33.980]  testicles? You get a bird get snapped by the bungee cord, but the balls keep going and make
[08:33.980 --> 08:39.820]  a tsunami in the water below. It's times like this that I wish I wish I was an artist. I'd love to be
[08:39.820 --> 08:45.140]  able to I'd love to draw a falcon with a big old pair of hairy balls. Do you think that a bird gets
[08:45.140 --> 08:51.000]  back to the nest? It's just nuts out. It's just laying down, popping the balls out. It's like
[08:51.000 --> 08:57.140]  Albaxan. Yeah, it's just that. I saw the most amazing animal dick the other day on a video.
[08:57.340 --> 09:04.020]  Can you guess which animal kingdom penis I was looking at? Hmm. Do you want to give us a multiple
[09:04.020 --> 09:09.560]  choice? Yeah, give us a little bit. There's a lot. It's a wide range. It was a barnacle.
[09:09.560 --> 09:16.200]  A barnacle? Really? Okay. I've learned that a barnacle is a little creature and it like it
[09:16.200 --> 09:20.940]  swims its head into a rock or something and then it builds a little shell around itself
[09:20.940 --> 09:29.580]  and it might be like a centimeter in length, but its penis is eight times its body length.
[09:30.080 --> 09:36.000]  So you have a load of barnacles all sat on a rock and then during mating they're all shooting their
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.160]  penises out and dipping their cocks in all the other nearby barnacles and they're all just like
[09:40.160 --> 09:44.260]  sharing. There might be a bit of three on one. It's the craziest shit I've ever seen in my life.
[09:44.460 --> 09:49.840]  And those are some long, I think it's the longest penis in the animal kingdom in relation to its
[09:49.840 --> 09:55.540]  body length. So are there boy barnacles and girl barnacles then? No, they're all hermaphrodites.
[09:55.740 --> 09:59.420]  Okay. The ones that I was watching. So it doesn't really matter where they land.
[09:59.980 --> 10:08.040]  It's just like a soggy cock orgy down there. Yeah, it was tremendous. There's nothing
[10:08.040 --> 10:14.580]  freakier than just nature on planet earth. This guy's got so many dicks. Look at this dick face.
[10:15.020 --> 10:22.000]  Just dicking about. Cocks everywhere. We don't even know it. I don't know his character name
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.860]  from Pirates of the Caribbean, but that's immediately where my brain went. Do you think
[10:26.860 --> 10:30.540]  he just walks into a cave for mating season because it's too embarrassing to talk to people?
[10:30.720 --> 10:35.480]  Oh no. I don't want to imagine. That's why you got to buy the DVDs. It's a deleted scene.
[10:35.820 --> 10:40.520]  It's on the unrated. That's a director's cut. Mating season with that guy. What's his name?
[10:40.600 --> 10:45.700]  He was in Thor. That guy's in a million things. Oh, I don't have the slightest idea.
[10:46.200 --> 10:52.560]  Yeah. There you go. Good pull. Thank you. Speaking of pull, I got a photo. Oh, let's see it.
[10:53.560 --> 10:59.900]  Unrelated. This is a callback. As we know, Gavin, you were talking about some potential
[10:59.900 --> 11:07.100]  joke thievery in the past. And I like to settle things. I like to make sure everything's cleared
[11:07.100 --> 11:13.700]  up. So I went and I did my due diligence and I found the tweet and then immediately closed the
[11:13.700 --> 11:23.780]  because not not great. I don't think Jack saw that. Nine likes. One quote. Five reposts.
[11:24.420 --> 11:28.180]  So you think the chances are slim? I think they were very slim.
[11:28.600 --> 11:30.640]  It wasn't. It didn't get a lot of attention.
[11:34.080 --> 11:39.400]  But I mean, they worked in the same office. Oh, no, not in November, though. Not in November.
[11:39.400 --> 11:44.380]  Not even after my first stint. So that doesn't show views, though.
[11:44.840 --> 11:49.840]  Nobody. I mean, that's true. I don't know. Nine likes is pretty rough.
[11:50.660 --> 11:53.640]  I'm sorry that my tweet wasn't very good back in 2009.
[11:53.780 --> 11:57.880]  I'm not saying I'm just saying as far as like, I don't think that went around. I think the algorithm
[11:57.880 --> 12:02.240]  didn't help. That tweet is my argument. Do people like tweets that much, though?
[12:02.240 --> 12:08.540]  I feel like... Are you proposing that Jack would have liked the tweet?
[12:10.740 --> 12:18.360]  I think that the likes reflect how many people see the tweet. And the fact that I think I'm
[12:18.360 --> 12:24.400]  one of the nine that have liked it does not help the case that this was visible at any time.
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.720]  I had to search it on your profile. I think that just lends itself to the idea that Jack
[12:29.720 --> 12:33.380]  felt comfortable stealing it because he knew not a lot of people would see it.
[12:33.380 --> 12:37.460]  A hundred percent. I don't know what Andrew's trying to prove here. It feels like he proved
[12:37.460 --> 12:42.040]  the inverse, right? That's a pretty slow-mo tweet, so I wasn't known.
[12:42.660 --> 12:47.440]  You've damned Jack. As a matter of fact, Jack is probably one of the only people who could
[12:47.440 --> 12:50.660]  have seen it back then because nobody knew or liked Gavin back then.
[12:50.700 --> 12:55.020]  I think Andrew's proving it to be true. Also, have you checked the date? Was that,
[12:55.180 --> 12:57.060]  in fact, before the podcast?
[12:57.060 --> 13:04.220]  I was having a hard time aligning your version of the podcast with... because I did look in there
[13:04.220 --> 13:12.660]  as well. I don't think what you said was exactly accurate. The time didn't come up when I listened.
[13:12.680 --> 13:14.680]  It didn't come up? Where am I getting it from?
[13:15.420 --> 13:18.220]  I don't know. I think you may have misremembered when it happened.
[13:18.520 --> 13:22.280]  If the podcast came out before this tweet, then that means Gavin stole it from Jack.
[13:22.860 --> 13:23.120]  Yeah.
[13:23.540 --> 13:24.740]  Oh, that would be a twist.
[13:25.300 --> 13:26.780]  See, now you're excited to find out.
[13:27.460 --> 13:29.220]  I gotta go. I'm going back to the lab.
[13:30.440 --> 13:34.140]  I like how quickly Gavin agreed with that. He just went,
[13:34.240 --> 13:35.980]  yeah, I must have stolen it then. Absolutely.
[13:39.040 --> 13:42.880]  Speaking of lab, I have two lab things I want to get to today at some point.
[13:42.980 --> 13:43.240]  Okay.
[13:43.720 --> 13:47.740]  But we don't have to do it right now. Should we talk about the baseball game last night?
[13:47.880 --> 13:48.340]  That was pretty fun.
[13:48.340 --> 13:48.600]  Yeah, go ahead.
[13:49.040 --> 13:50.060]  Dollar hot dog night.
[13:50.680 --> 13:53.800]  Talk about the fact that you're too sick to record a Let's Play,
[13:53.800 --> 13:56.160]  but good enough to go to dollar hot dog night.
[13:56.520 --> 13:58.820]  Dude, I wouldn't say I was good enough,
[13:58.960 --> 14:01.740]  but I was definitely better at the end of the day than I was at the beginning of the day.
[14:02.120 --> 14:04.180]  I was on the mend, as it were.
[14:05.540 --> 14:08.960]  So I went out of town with Millie over the weekend to go visit a college,
[14:09.080 --> 14:10.980]  and I got sick on Monday.
[14:11.900 --> 14:15.340]  And then by last night, I was mostly better.
[14:15.560 --> 14:19.980]  But I got real sick all at once, but only for like 36 hours.
[14:19.980 --> 14:22.300]  And I think it just must be because I'm run down from,
[14:23.320 --> 14:27.500]  I don't know, all the tragedy and trauma of losing my career and whatnot.
[14:28.340 --> 14:29.620]  I think I'm just running on empty.
[14:31.080 --> 14:34.720]  But I couldn't... I was still sick enough that I couldn't eat my hot dogs.
[14:36.200 --> 14:36.540]  I was only able to...
[14:36.540 --> 14:37.980]  Okay, well then, yeah, never mind.
[14:38.240 --> 14:38.900]  Take back what I said.
[14:39.020 --> 14:40.100]  You're... yeah, you're sick.
[14:40.320 --> 14:41.660]  Yeah, I was pretty... it was pretty ill.
[14:41.800 --> 14:42.940]  I barely had any cotton candy.
[14:43.320 --> 14:44.620]  We've been hanging out quite a lot recently.
[14:44.900 --> 14:46.960]  We have. It's been nice. I've enjoyed it.
[14:46.960 --> 14:48.300]  You, not so much.
[14:48.780 --> 14:50.160]  But I've enjoyed everybody else.
[14:50.500 --> 14:51.320]  I enjoy Meg a lot.
[14:51.460 --> 14:53.900]  You're just there, usually.
[14:54.220 --> 14:55.860]  But that's okay. I think I'm just...
[14:56.460 --> 14:57.100]  I gotta be honest with you.
[14:57.120 --> 14:58.120]  It's been a long friendship.
[14:58.580 --> 14:59.300]  I got over it.
[14:59.800 --> 15:00.880]  I mean, can't argue that.
[15:01.460 --> 15:02.120]  No, I'm kidding.
[15:02.340 --> 15:03.360]  I've had a lot of fun lately.
[15:03.880 --> 15:05.040]  Whose idea was the baseball games?
[15:05.060 --> 15:05.460]  Was that Eric?
[15:05.740 --> 15:06.580]  I believe it was mine.
[15:06.940 --> 15:08.160]  Oh, thank you.
[15:08.580 --> 15:09.200]  Yeah, you know what?
[15:09.380 --> 15:09.960]  Yeah, never mind.
[15:10.060 --> 15:10.440]  It was Andrew.
[15:11.020 --> 15:12.400]  Yeah, I sent you all a Google invite.
[15:12.460 --> 15:12.880]  It was great.
[15:13.600 --> 15:15.220]  Didn't you win something at the baseball game?
[15:15.220 --> 15:16.900]  I want to know about you winning something.
[15:17.880 --> 15:18.740]  What did you win?
[15:20.740 --> 15:21.600]  What did I win?
[15:21.700 --> 15:22.300]  I got a...
[15:22.800 --> 15:25.040]  At the third inning, they do like trivia.
[15:25.740 --> 15:27.980]  And they asked if I wanted to do trivia.
[15:28.240 --> 15:29.500]  And I was like, absolutely not.
[15:30.620 --> 15:32.640]  And then Emily and Eric were like, yes, he does.
[15:32.800 --> 15:34.140]  And I was like, I really don't.
[15:34.200 --> 15:35.440]  And the guy goes, oh, it'll be...
[15:35.440 --> 15:35.880]  Oh, shit.
[15:35.920 --> 15:36.280]  Are you...
[15:36.280 --> 15:36.980]  You're Geoff?
[15:37.080 --> 15:37.920]  And I was like, ah, fuck.
[15:38.080 --> 15:38.600]  And I was like, yeah.
[15:38.600 --> 15:39.820]  And he goes, all right, you're definitely doing it.
[15:40.500 --> 15:43.260]  And then I was like, I was like, oh, um...
[15:43.260 --> 15:44.220]  Gavin's here, too.
[15:44.220 --> 15:45.840]  I tried to throw Gavin under the bus.
[15:45.900 --> 15:47.340]  He's like, cool, we'll mic him up, too.
[15:48.020 --> 15:51.340]  And then when they came by, Gavin conveniently went to the bathroom,
[15:51.580 --> 15:52.960]  which was very smart of him.
[15:54.040 --> 15:56.120]  And I had to do Whataburger trivia.
[15:57.760 --> 16:00.540]  So were you at a spontaneous ad for Whataburger?
[16:02.340 --> 16:03.920]  Yeah, I just was suddenly...
[16:03.920 --> 16:05.420]  They were like, they asked me the question, like,
[16:05.540 --> 16:09.160]  what is the one animal that is allowed to go through the Whataburger drive-thru?
[16:09.260 --> 16:13.020]  And it was like, horse, bull or llama.
[16:13.020 --> 16:14.640]  And so clearly it's horse.
[16:14.660 --> 16:15.380]  We live in Texas.
[16:15.800 --> 16:16.840]  And so I said horse.
[16:16.940 --> 16:18.580]  And then they were like, wrong, it's bull.
[16:18.700 --> 16:20.080]  And I was like, are you fucking kidding me?
[16:20.220 --> 16:22.560]  And then they were like, April Fools, it is actually horse.
[16:22.640 --> 16:24.020]  We don't know why the card is wrong.
[16:25.920 --> 16:28.300]  Wait, when was... this was yesterday?
[16:28.820 --> 16:29.680]  It was last night, yeah.
[16:30.020 --> 16:33.160]  Ah, April 10th, the classic day of April Fools.
[16:33.560 --> 16:34.720]  Yeah, April Fools plus nine.
[16:35.020 --> 16:36.060]  It was just an arrow, was it?
[16:36.340 --> 16:37.180]  I think so, yeah.
[16:37.200 --> 16:37.460]  OK.
[16:37.900 --> 16:40.760]  And they gave me a bag with a Whataburger koozie.
[16:41.160 --> 16:42.260]  So I'm fucking set.
[16:43.020 --> 16:45.300]  We also hung out for the eclipse.
[16:46.680 --> 16:51.680]  And we saw little glimpses of totality through quite a lot of cloud.
[16:52.220 --> 16:54.160]  And everyone was, you know, taking pictures and stuff.
[16:54.260 --> 16:57.820]  And I thought, when I was looking at the thing, I want to get a picture.
[16:57.940 --> 17:00.060]  But how would the British Jackal take the picture?
[17:02.400 --> 17:03.620]  So I got this little bag.
[17:07.220 --> 17:08.680]  That is the moon.
[17:09.200 --> 17:10.840]  That's exactly in front of the sun.
[17:11.300 --> 17:12.000]  That's fantastic.
[17:12.600 --> 17:14.600]  That's exactly how Gracie would take that picture.
[17:14.860 --> 17:15.480]  That's really good.
[17:15.740 --> 17:16.800]  Classic British Jackal.
[17:18.140 --> 17:18.220]  Right.
[17:18.300 --> 17:19.140]  That's awesome.
[17:20.160 --> 17:20.360]  Right.
[17:24.760 --> 17:27.040]  Gracie, did you get any pictures of it?
[17:27.260 --> 17:27.760]  Did you see it?
[17:28.000 --> 17:28.880]  Yeah, I'm actually...
[17:30.160 --> 17:31.660]  I mean, y'all know I have trouble with this.
[17:31.700 --> 17:35.480]  I'm trying to get my photos on the computer so I can send them to y'all.
[17:35.960 --> 17:37.280]  Are you my mom?
[17:37.460 --> 17:38.240]  What's going on?
[17:38.240 --> 17:42.960]  I don't... I don't know why the photos don't go well.
[17:44.720 --> 17:46.560]  Photos on my computer.
[17:46.800 --> 17:47.320]  Oh, it worked!
[17:47.960 --> 17:48.880]  Yes, it did!
[17:49.240 --> 17:51.500]  Whoa, that's really good.
[17:51.620 --> 17:52.540]  That's cute.
[17:53.260 --> 17:54.260]  Oh, that's great.
[17:54.700 --> 17:55.060]  That's awesome.
[17:55.060 --> 17:57.400]  She's blind, so I guess the glasses didn't matter.
[17:59.640 --> 18:00.420]  You know.
[18:00.740 --> 18:04.200]  It would be cool if the eclipse shocked her back to sight.
[18:05.600 --> 18:06.640]  Oh, did the reverse?
[18:07.120 --> 18:07.440]  Yeah.
[18:07.440 --> 18:11.880]  I don't know that she could handle that.
[18:12.260 --> 18:16.140]  I think that might be the straw that would break the camel's back of Cinnamon.
[18:18.220 --> 18:22.120]  Cinnamon came in for a recording of another podcast not too long ago,
[18:22.400 --> 18:30.160]  and I've never seen a dog sundown in the middle of the day while pacing infinitely.
[18:30.440 --> 18:33.380]  Would not stop at all.
[18:33.820 --> 18:35.680]  Cinnamon is in her own world.
[18:36.260 --> 18:36.580]  Yeah.
[18:36.640 --> 18:36.960]  Perfect.
[18:37.380 --> 18:37.960]  Is what she is.
[18:38.260 --> 18:38.520]  Fuck!
[18:38.560 --> 18:40.720]  That's what Arrow was like for the last year or so.
[18:41.860 --> 18:42.340]  What's this one?
[18:43.940 --> 18:44.740]  It's another hack.
[18:44.880 --> 18:45.160]  Dot hack.
[18:45.560 --> 18:46.000]  That's a hack.
[18:46.000 --> 18:46.840]  Oh, wow.
[18:46.980 --> 18:47.360]  Look at that.
[18:47.380 --> 18:48.340]  You got a better view of it.
[18:49.460 --> 18:50.000]  What if everybody...
[18:50.680 --> 18:50.740]  Wait, did it work?
[18:51.360 --> 18:53.820]  Yeah, well, I had to download it and open it.
[18:53.940 --> 18:54.880]  Oh, well, here you go.
[18:55.780 --> 18:56.420]  Oh, wow.
[18:57.100 --> 18:59.380]  That's like the diamond ring, they call it or whatever.
[19:00.780 --> 19:04.280]  Well, it looks kind of like a ring when there's a lot on one side,
[19:04.280 --> 19:05.800]  so it looks kind of like the shape of a ring.
[19:06.420 --> 19:06.820]  Yeah.
[19:08.500 --> 19:12.940]  What if what if the Eclipse stole everyone who stared at it without glasses?
[19:13.560 --> 19:16.320]  It stole everyone's vision, but one person.
[19:16.480 --> 19:19.100]  And then they got the power of everybody else's vision.
[19:19.240 --> 19:19.500]  Right.
[19:19.540 --> 19:20.640]  They got like super vision.
[19:20.860 --> 19:22.740]  Yeah, like 20,000, 20,000 vision.
[19:23.360 --> 19:24.420]  So I don't think I'd want that.
[19:24.500 --> 19:25.200]  But for eyesight.
[19:25.680 --> 19:29.360]  I think that'd be a nightmare to have like, yeah, the one's eyesight.
[19:29.980 --> 19:33.420]  If you could see everything, like see a speck of dust.
[19:33.420 --> 19:36.080]  Just I think you'd realize how dirty everything is.
[19:36.360 --> 19:36.980]  It would be terrible.
[19:38.200 --> 19:42.800]  There was a there was a comic book I read many years ago called Rising Stars, where
[19:43.580 --> 19:48.700]  everybody in this town that was fucking when a comet went over the town all got pregnant
[19:48.700 --> 19:52.100]  and then they all had kids and then those kids were all born with superpowers.
[19:52.320 --> 19:54.480]  And then every time one of those kids would die,
[19:54.720 --> 19:56.660]  like get hit by a car or something because they're young,
[19:56.980 --> 19:58.380]  everybody else's powers would increase.
[19:58.620 --> 20:01.460]  So then one of them became a serial killer and started killing them all
[20:01.460 --> 20:02.820]  and they were all becoming more powerful.
[20:03.060 --> 20:04.680]  And then but so was the killer.
[20:04.780 --> 20:06.700]  And they were trying to figure out who it was that was killing them.
[20:06.720 --> 20:07.600]  And I never finished it.
[20:07.840 --> 20:09.520]  Is that different to the Triffids thing?
[20:10.180 --> 20:10.840]  Day of the Triffids?
[20:10.980 --> 20:12.160]  I never saw that or read it.
[20:12.160 --> 20:13.080]  Doesn't that get everyone blind?
[20:13.620 --> 20:14.440]  I don't know.
[20:15.020 --> 20:16.460]  And then it's like plants.
[20:16.920 --> 20:18.780]  I know of it, but I never saw it.
[20:20.640 --> 20:24.120]  There's the movie Blindness where they all went blind for no reason.
[20:24.660 --> 20:26.740]  And then they got their sight back for no reason.
[20:27.780 --> 20:28.460]  Wasn't good.
[20:28.720 --> 20:29.400]  Wouldn't recommend it.
[20:29.400 --> 20:35.700]  I also took an eclipse photo because I saw my social media feed was filled with everybody
[20:35.700 --> 20:36.580]  else taking photos.
[20:37.200 --> 20:39.740]  This was my contribution to the overall conversation.
[20:40.240 --> 20:41.900]  Look at this crazy eclipse.
[20:42.440 --> 20:43.160]  Oh my god.
[20:44.460 --> 20:47.400]  It's really the white cover in the silver.
[20:48.080 --> 20:48.760]  Is that an Umidigi?
[20:49.400 --> 20:50.880]  Yeah, that's my Umidigi bison.
[20:51.780 --> 20:54.680]  Unfortunately, not watermarked or so you wouldn't have to ask.
[20:55.120 --> 20:57.180]  Do you have a sprinkler?
[20:57.600 --> 20:58.020]  I do.
[20:58.180 --> 20:58.420]  Yeah.
[20:58.420 --> 20:59.740]  It terrifies me.
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.320]  You have made me terrified of sprinklers.
[21:02.840 --> 21:03.300]  You should be.
[21:03.400 --> 21:04.380]  You made me so scared of them.
[21:05.800 --> 21:08.600]  You did that slow-mo video of how they work.
[21:08.800 --> 21:13.580]  And in my head, it's just like the most flimsy piece of glass just holding everything together.
[21:13.900 --> 21:17.040]  And I assume if I break one, they'll all go off somehow.
[21:17.840 --> 21:19.600]  And I'm terrified of them.
[21:19.980 --> 21:24.000]  It's just like my video, except the water pressure in reality is like five times higher.
[21:24.400 --> 21:24.980]  Oh god.
[21:25.920 --> 21:27.140]  I don't know what I'd save.
[21:28.420 --> 21:29.900]  What I'd grab, I could grab.
[21:30.160 --> 21:32.240]  If you're a achievement hunter, you wouldn't save anything.
[21:32.320 --> 21:33.740]  Apparently, you just let it all.
[21:35.900 --> 21:37.300]  God, I forgot about that.
[21:37.760 --> 21:42.000]  I didn't set that room back a year.
[21:42.840 --> 21:44.920]  I have a roosterteeth question for you, Geoff.
[21:46.200 --> 21:48.280]  I don't really work there anymore.
[21:49.020 --> 21:49.460]  Yeah, I know.
[21:49.500 --> 21:51.340]  Well, you were you were there at one point.
[21:51.400 --> 21:51.660]  You were there.
[21:51.840 --> 21:52.040]  I was.
[21:52.800 --> 21:54.380]  You may remember this.
[21:55.180 --> 21:58.400]  How did you make the mouse move in 1-800-MAGIC?
[21:58.420 --> 21:59.940]  Oh my god.
[22:01.640 --> 22:05.380]  How did I make the mouse move in 1-800-MAGIC?
[22:05.380 --> 22:06.020]  The mouth.
[22:06.380 --> 22:06.860]  Mouth.
[22:07.260 --> 22:10.820]  Oh, the mouths move in 1-800-MAGIC.
[22:10.920 --> 22:13.400]  You work on 1-800-MAGIC at all?
[22:13.700 --> 22:14.320]  I did, yeah.
[22:15.000 --> 22:16.880]  We used a program called Crazy Talk.
[22:17.660 --> 22:18.320]  Oh, wow.
[22:18.500 --> 22:18.700]  Okay.
[22:19.280 --> 22:20.220]  That did mouth movements.
[22:20.820 --> 22:22.660]  We used it a lot in those early days.
[22:23.160 --> 22:26.840]  I think that was mostly a... I think Joel directed that production,
[22:26.840 --> 22:28.060]  If Memory Serves.
[22:28.400 --> 22:29.960]  So he would have done the lion's share of it.
[22:30.020 --> 22:31.100]  I did a lot of the machinima.
[22:31.320 --> 22:34.340]  But yeah, Joel and Matt really did a lot of the Crazy Talk stuff.
[22:34.440 --> 22:35.380]  Yeah, you would just like...
[22:35.380 --> 22:37.720]  It was very... It was like pre-VTuber stuff, right?
[22:37.760 --> 22:39.120]  Real rudimentary, not great.
[22:39.180 --> 22:43.560]  But it was like one step up from those Conan O'Brien bits in the old days.
[22:44.400 --> 22:47.060]  We watched episode one, Eric and I, recently.
[22:47.620 --> 22:48.180]  I'm gonna keep it for a minute.
[22:48.180 --> 22:48.300]  Hold up.
[22:50.420 --> 22:51.140]  It exists.
[22:51.940 --> 22:53.780]  You can definitely watch it.
[22:53.780 --> 22:54.520]  It exists.
[22:55.580 --> 22:58.800]  I genuinely don't remember anything about it.
[22:58.860 --> 22:59.780]  I don't even know if I'm in it.
[23:00.360 --> 23:01.440]  Yeah, you are.
[23:01.660 --> 23:03.240]  You are, I think.
[23:03.600 --> 23:05.240]  I can't tell, but I think you are.
[23:05.380 --> 23:06.740]  I think you're voice modulated.
[23:07.480 --> 23:10.820]  Andrew found it on his Xbox 360
[23:10.820 --> 23:14.320]  as he went through his previously downloaded material
[23:14.320 --> 23:17.040]  and re-downloaded it so we could watch it.
[23:17.420 --> 23:17.960]  Oh, wow.
[23:18.560 --> 23:20.120]  We're doing some videos.
[23:20.280 --> 23:22.060]  And at the end of every episode of the video,
[23:22.060 --> 23:23.900]  we're watching episode one of Henry Magic.
[23:24.040 --> 23:25.260]  We got three more to go, but...
[23:27.960 --> 23:31.460]  It's so fucking goofy, dude.
[23:32.620 --> 23:38.760]  You can tell when it was made because it's attempting to be so cinematic.
[23:39.320 --> 23:42.220]  And you're like, huh, and what purpose does this serve?
[23:42.360 --> 23:45.280]  And it really is, well, you know, to be cinematic.
[23:45.740 --> 23:47.120]  It's fucking great.
[23:47.360 --> 23:48.860]  It is so much fun to watch.
[23:48.860 --> 23:53.240]  I remember that game being difficult to machinimate in,
[23:53.440 --> 23:58.720]  but the reality is fucking every single game other than Halo was difficult to machinimate in.
[23:58.760 --> 24:00.400]  That's why we only did a few series.
[24:00.780 --> 24:04.040]  Yeah, it's one of the nice features about the 360
[24:04.620 --> 24:07.520]  is you can view your entire downloaded history.
[24:07.800 --> 24:12.940]  And the 360 marketplace is closing in either June or July.
[24:13.180 --> 24:15.920]  So I went all the way down to the bottom yesterday,
[24:15.920 --> 24:21.680]  and I am just going through grabbing every weird thing I downloaded at the time,
[24:22.120 --> 24:25.720]  thinking it was good content or just fascinating.
[24:26.060 --> 24:29.960]  So I have like 15 videos on E3 2007.
[24:30.880 --> 24:34.420]  I have wacky bloopers with Seth Green
[24:35.120 --> 24:38.820]  from when he did Mass Effect voiceover at Shia LaBeouf interviews.
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.480]  I got a lot of stuff for us to unpack eventually.
[24:41.800 --> 24:43.700]  So what are you doing with it? How are you keeping it?
[24:43.700 --> 24:45.260]  It's just on my 360.
[24:45.380 --> 24:47.440]  I'm downloading it to my hard drive on my 360.
[24:47.780 --> 24:48.200]  Oh, I see.
[24:48.680 --> 24:50.800]  Yes, that is so cool.
[24:50.900 --> 24:51.700]  Yeah, you should.
[24:51.900 --> 24:57.640]  It is a massive annoyance, but it yeah, so slow.
[24:57.960 --> 25:02.800]  Going from menu to fucking menu is just like eating glass.
[25:02.900 --> 25:05.820]  It sucks and you suffer through it.
[25:05.840 --> 25:10.920]  So you can watch the first episode of 1-800-MAGIC.
[25:11.420 --> 25:13.120]  It's fucking crazy.
[25:13.780 --> 25:19.840]  Some of it, though, is great because it's things I didn't even know existed,
[25:20.040 --> 25:21.500]  but I downloaded and played.
[25:22.220 --> 25:25.300]  So, for example, I got a Real Steel demo.
[25:25.560 --> 25:29.140]  I didn't know they made a video game of the movie Real Steel.
[25:29.840 --> 25:31.100]  And I have that.
[25:31.140 --> 25:31.880]  What was it?
[25:31.980 --> 25:32.480]  I don't know what it is.
[25:32.960 --> 25:36.400]  It was a Hugh Jackman action movie.
[25:36.660 --> 25:39.620]  Where like a kid controls a robot thing, right?
[25:39.880 --> 25:41.300]  Yeah, that I think failed.
[25:41.420 --> 25:43.040]  I had no idea they made a game for it,
[25:43.040 --> 25:45.840]  but I guess I did because I downloaded it.
[25:47.800 --> 25:49.260]  And yeah, I have that demo.
[25:50.280 --> 25:53.740]  I'd like to do a video with everybody where it's just us going through weird stuff
[25:53.740 --> 25:56.500]  that I probably thought was cool when I was 14.
[25:56.980 --> 25:57.960]  I think that's a great idea.
[25:58.060 --> 25:58.620]  I think I'd love to.
[25:58.700 --> 26:01.340]  I'd love to see all of our download files.
[26:02.080 --> 26:04.660]  Well, everybody has to get on it soon because that marketplace is going away.
[26:04.740 --> 26:07.100]  So it's like part of it also is just preservation stuff.
[26:07.460 --> 26:10.800]  Yeah, they just turned off all the Wii U and 3DS stores too.
[26:11.440 --> 26:12.320]  They did.
[26:13.240 --> 26:14.820]  It is sad.
[26:15.080 --> 26:18.160]  It made me realize that there's probably stuff I wanted there
[26:18.980 --> 26:22.940]  because I realized I found a game called The Way of the Dog
[26:22.940 --> 26:24.940]  that I just didn't know existed.
[26:25.600 --> 26:30.920]  Like Snoop Dogg made a 360 arcade game that he is prevalent in
[26:30.920 --> 26:34.300]  that I've never heard anybody talk about or seen any gameplay for.
[26:34.740 --> 26:36.780]  It was during his Snoop Lion phase.
[26:37.220 --> 26:38.560]  It looks insane.
[26:40.040 --> 26:41.780]  I... Andrew showed it to me
[26:43.120 --> 26:48.660]  and I thought that that's what we were gonna play and then we didn't.
[26:49.520 --> 26:53.400]  So I just... it was just like, well, why... then what was this?
[26:53.720 --> 26:55.000]  Why did you trick me?
[26:55.320 --> 26:56.360]  Why did I get tricked?
[26:56.460 --> 26:59.440]  And he's like, oh, I didn't think that... I didn't think I...
[26:59.440 --> 27:02.100]  I thought I made it really clear that like we weren't playing this.
[27:02.160 --> 27:04.900]  And it's like, well, this is the only thing you showed me.
[27:04.900 --> 27:07.360]  To be... I open with we're not playing it,
[27:07.420 --> 27:10.280]  but I just learned this thing exists and I need to show you this
[27:10.280 --> 27:12.400]  because I don't... I've never seen this.
[27:12.800 --> 27:13.180]  I didn't know this was a thing.
[27:13.180 --> 27:16.800]  We recorded like the first 10 minutes of this fucking other gameplay
[27:16.800 --> 27:19.740]  that is just us looking at stuff for Way of the Dog.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.440]  And then we didn't play it.
[27:22.680 --> 27:23.660]  We'll get there.
[27:25.300 --> 27:26.360]  We'll eventually get there.
[27:26.420 --> 27:29.640]  I got very excited because I have the Expendables 2 game demo
[27:29.640 --> 27:31.580]  and it is so bad.
[27:31.700 --> 27:33.840]  The voice acting is so hilariously terrible.
[27:33.840 --> 27:36.000]  And it's one of my... you can't buy it anymore.
[27:36.240 --> 27:38.020]  I just have access to it because of the demo.
[27:38.400 --> 27:39.520]  Apparently, Eric bought it.
[27:39.700 --> 27:42.160]  So we might do a deeper dive.
[27:42.440 --> 27:44.140]  I have... I have this game.
[27:44.400 --> 27:45.660]  I'm pretty... I just had to like look it up.
[27:45.740 --> 27:46.680]  I have Expendables 2.
[27:46.760 --> 27:47.720]  I've beaten it a bunch of times.
[27:47.920 --> 27:51.000]  We should make a point with the new thing of playing
[27:51.520 --> 27:53.400]  the most terrible video games that are on.
[27:53.400 --> 27:53.700]  Oh, yeah.
[27:53.840 --> 27:56.100]  We have to like really hunt to track down like that.
[27:56.160 --> 27:56.880]  And that's a great idea.
[27:57.180 --> 27:57.820]  Like Ratey Boy?
[27:58.520 --> 27:59.340]  Yeah, exactly.
[28:00.160 --> 28:01.780]  Expendables 2 and Ratey Boy.
[28:01.780 --> 28:04.840]  As an example, yes, Ratey Boy.
[28:05.020 --> 28:07.720]  As a thing in practice, no Ratey Boy.
[28:08.020 --> 28:08.320]  Exactly.
[28:08.540 --> 28:08.740]  Right.
[28:09.500 --> 28:12.200]  I had an idea for when we get jobs at the mall.
[28:12.540 --> 28:12.880]  Oh, yeah.
[28:12.960 --> 28:13.200]  Okay.
[28:13.700 --> 28:15.560]  Because, you know, we're going to get our free time.
[28:15.720 --> 28:16.160]  We could do it.
[28:16.400 --> 28:16.460]  Yeah.
[28:16.600 --> 28:21.360]  But I think what we should all do first is go through some quite heavy makeup
[28:22.200 --> 28:25.220]  to mimic what the undercover boss does.
[28:25.800 --> 28:27.460]  So that when we apply for a job,
[28:27.740 --> 28:30.840]  they'll definitely give us the job because they'll think we're the undercover boss.
[28:30.840 --> 28:32.700]  So I'm thinking like taped on beard,
[28:33.980 --> 28:37.620]  some sort of wig and a cap just to make us look slightly out of place.
[28:37.780 --> 28:42.480]  So we're going to impersonate undercover boss impersonating an employee.
[28:43.080 --> 28:43.260]  Exactly.
[28:43.680 --> 28:44.320]  I love this.
[28:44.460 --> 28:45.800]  Just to give us the edge.
[28:46.440 --> 28:48.440]  And it will probably keep people off our back.
[28:48.700 --> 28:51.040]  And it'll keep people friendly to us.
[28:51.040 --> 28:51.740]  I like it.
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  This is a brilliant idea, Gavin.
[28:53.480 --> 28:55.840]  And then we should just secretly keep having like
[28:55.840 --> 28:58.180]  what look like serious calls in the corner.
[28:58.320 --> 29:00.200]  And they'll be like, oh, sorry, I'm back.
[29:00.840 --> 29:03.860]  And just constantly be like writing stuff down in a notebook.
[29:04.240 --> 29:06.060]  Like, yeah, furrowing your brow.
[29:08.080 --> 29:09.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[29:10.820 --> 29:13.080]  Now I want to do undercover boss stuff.
[29:13.260 --> 29:15.640]  I'm looking at undercover boss makeup stuff.
[29:16.280 --> 29:18.920]  Some of these are so good.
[29:20.840 --> 29:24.620]  We all need to go through the undercover boss makeover.
[29:25.240 --> 29:27.600]  Maybe we can employ some of the people from the show.
[29:28.240 --> 29:29.000]  I want to know.
[29:29.240 --> 29:34.500]  I want to know what I would look like if I was a CEO working retail.
[29:34.840 --> 29:35.840]  These are great.
[29:36.540 --> 29:41.140]  Do you think they get any like control over what the outfits look like?
[29:41.520 --> 29:43.620]  Because we're looking at a guy with like brown hair,
[29:43.620 --> 29:48.860]  and they put him in a blonde wig and gave him blonde facial hair, plain shirt.
[29:50.520 --> 29:53.500]  That's the least convincing makeup I've ever seen.
[29:54.760 --> 29:59.680]  It's a guy with like very clean cut and then like the shaggiest hair.
[29:59.680 --> 30:00.900]  We all gotta do this.
[30:01.320 --> 30:01.580]  Yeah.
[30:02.080 --> 30:05.260]  I'm so... you sent me down a fucking rabbit hole.
[30:05.520 --> 30:06.460]  This drops.
[30:06.780 --> 30:09.180]  The Yankee Candle guy is amazing.
[30:12.160 --> 30:16.180]  We just need a group photo of all of us as undercover bosses, I think.
[30:16.220 --> 30:17.860]  I think it'd be a sick poster.
[30:18.540 --> 30:20.000]  What the fuck?
[30:20.600 --> 30:22.880]  Well, I found some of them.
[30:27.980 --> 30:32.780]  The thing with that show that I thought was always so funny
[30:32.780 --> 30:37.220]  is the notion that a person working at Yankee Candle in the mall
[30:37.760 --> 30:40.100]  would just know what the CEO looks like.
[30:40.200 --> 30:42.080]  Like, that's such a ridiculous assumption.
[30:42.560 --> 30:47.580]  That is such a self-like ego thing of like, well, of course they'll recognize me.
[30:47.820 --> 30:49.180]  I've got to be disguised.
[30:49.700 --> 30:50.820]  The manager might.
[30:52.880 --> 30:57.780]  Listen, I don't know about that, but I don't think I could name...
[30:57.780 --> 31:02.360]  If I go into a mall, I bet you I don't know what the CEO looks like of any of those places.
[31:02.580 --> 31:05.520]  Dude, I worked at Sidney's Fried Chicken in high school.
[31:05.660 --> 31:10.120]  They had three stores in the area where I grew up.
[31:10.260 --> 31:14.180]  And I couldn't have told you what the owner of those stores looked like to save my life.
[31:14.600 --> 31:15.220]  No fucking clue.
[31:15.940 --> 31:16.340]  Ridiculous.
[31:16.340 --> 31:20.560]  That dude never, never showed his face in my Sidney's Fried Chicken in Theodore.
[31:21.480 --> 31:24.780]  Theon Sanders is like the exception of like, yeah, it makes sense.
[31:24.940 --> 31:25.340]  You need to.
[31:25.920 --> 31:29.240]  Why did we never dress up Matt and give him a job in achievement?
[31:32.260 --> 31:33.480]  That would have been class.
[31:34.920 --> 31:37.980]  I actually had a funny idea to see if you could have convinced
[31:37.980 --> 31:40.780]  the other people that this is not somebody they work with.
[31:41.100 --> 31:42.840]  Be like, yeah, it's a streamer coming in.
[31:43.620 --> 31:44.560]  Yeah, they do.
[31:46.740 --> 31:50.100]  Is this the point where I admit to everybody that Jeremy Dooley was
[31:50.100 --> 31:51.780]  was actually Matt Holum in disguise?
[31:52.140 --> 31:52.840]  Oh, my God.
[31:54.720 --> 31:56.720]  We got too deep into it.
[31:56.760 --> 31:57.800]  We didn't know how to get out.
[31:57.980 --> 31:59.900]  So we had to move him to Boston.
[32:01.320 --> 32:02.900]  The only way we could end the bit.
[32:03.600 --> 32:05.620]  I never saw them together.
[32:06.160 --> 32:07.860]  It's so fucking funny.
[32:09.760 --> 32:12.760]  It's by virtue of Matt not being there.
[32:12.840 --> 32:14.260]  Yeah, I've never seen him together.
[32:15.180 --> 32:18.520]  Matt Holum had to walk around on his knees for three fucking years.
[32:18.760 --> 32:20.920]  He was sick of it by the end.
[32:22.540 --> 32:27.480]  It is a great, like, qualifier because as Eric's saying, it means nothing.
[32:28.260 --> 32:31.020]  I've never seen John Adams and Albert Einstein together.
[32:31.220 --> 32:32.720]  That doesn't mean they're the same person.
[32:32.980 --> 32:33.840]  But I like that.
[32:33.860 --> 32:35.180]  Just applying that to anyone.
[32:36.360 --> 32:37.440]  Big Show and Brad Pitt.
[32:37.540 --> 32:38.380]  Never seen them together.
[32:38.640 --> 32:39.340]  Can't rule it out.
[32:39.660 --> 32:40.220]  Don't know.
[32:40.680 --> 32:42.160]  Eric and Andrew, never seen them together.
[32:42.160 --> 32:43.080]  It's true.
[32:43.620 --> 32:46.680]  That's your fault because we have been together, even though Eric doesn't know it.
[32:46.920 --> 32:47.200]  What?
[32:47.660 --> 32:49.380]  Oh, probably like a PAX or something.
[32:49.660 --> 32:52.100]  I went to PAX and we interacted.
[32:52.120 --> 32:52.460]  Got it.
[32:53.020 --> 32:53.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[32:53.660 --> 32:54.080]  Okay, yeah.
[32:54.140 --> 32:54.620]  So I agree.
[32:54.720 --> 32:55.320]  That's Gavin's fault.
[32:55.420 --> 32:55.520]  Yeah.
[32:56.040 --> 32:56.580]  Yeah, it is.
[32:57.360 --> 32:59.460]  Hey, I want to give you guys opinion on something.
[32:59.880 --> 33:00.880]  This is one of my...
[33:00.880 --> 33:01.900]  It's a minor lab thing.
[33:02.200 --> 33:07.420]  But y'all know how I'm recording all of my farts so that I can release my audiobook,
[33:07.620 --> 33:09.260]  One Thousand and One Farts.
[33:09.900 --> 33:10.120]  Yeah.
[33:10.120 --> 33:12.320]  Which I'm making great progress with, by the way.
[33:13.060 --> 33:16.740]  I woke up the other night at like 3.30 in the morning and just had like a...
[33:16.740 --> 33:19.020]  Let's just say I had a burst of creativity.
[33:20.580 --> 33:21.940]  Got like seven or eight good ones out.
[33:22.940 --> 33:25.840]  But while I was recording my farts or while I've been recording my farts,
[33:25.880 --> 33:27.180]  I've been thinking of other things to record.
[33:27.940 --> 33:31.040]  Well, you're already in the middle of recording A Thousand and One Gallons of Piss.
[33:31.180 --> 33:32.280]  You're just doing that simultaneously.
[33:33.520 --> 33:33.980]  Well, yeah.
[33:34.000 --> 33:38.580]  That's what I was going to say is, should I be recording all of my P's?
[33:38.740 --> 33:39.040]  No.
[33:39.040 --> 33:40.340]  No, hold on.
[33:41.360 --> 33:42.020]  Hold on.
[33:42.560 --> 33:43.560]  Let's see where I'm going.
[33:44.080 --> 33:46.860]  What if, Andrew, you recorded yourself peeing?
[33:46.940 --> 33:47.700]  What would it sound like?
[33:47.760 --> 33:49.880]  It would sound like you peeing, right?
[33:49.980 --> 33:51.620]  Or it would sound like the beginning of Goonies
[33:51.620 --> 33:54.020]  when they're trying to figure out how to get down to the basement.
[33:54.420 --> 33:56.080]  It would just sound like a person pissing.
[33:56.200 --> 34:01.340]  But what if you layered 100 of your P's on top of each other?
[34:02.100 --> 34:04.400]  Would it sound like Niagara Falls?
[34:04.400 --> 34:09.060]  Would it sound like the piss version of a roaring waterfall?
[34:09.500 --> 34:14.460]  And if so, would that be the first ever piss waterfall in existence?
[34:14.700 --> 34:16.380]  Wouldn't we be breaking new ground?
[34:16.860 --> 34:18.100]  New sonic ground?
[34:18.780 --> 34:22.780]  Do you think if you record a thousand people whispering, it sounds like people yelling?
[34:23.200 --> 34:24.740]  No, I think it sounds like a thousand people whispering.
[34:25.120 --> 34:25.560]  Yeah.
[34:26.120 --> 34:27.180]  It'd be pretty loud, though.
[34:27.400 --> 34:29.240]  I think... I don't know, Gav.
[34:29.260 --> 34:31.420]  I don't know what happens when I record myself peeing 100 times
[34:31.420 --> 34:32.920]  and lay it all on top of each other.
[34:32.920 --> 34:34.840]  But it might sound really fucking cool.
[34:34.940 --> 34:36.540]  So I think we should find out.
[34:36.660 --> 34:38.580]  So I'm gonna... I haven't started yet.
[34:38.660 --> 34:41.980]  But as of today, I'm going to start recording all of my P's.
[34:42.680 --> 34:46.540]  If I found out that the waterfall sound that I fall asleep to
[34:46.540 --> 34:51.240]  is just a dude's pee 100 times over, I would be so mad.
[34:51.680 --> 34:52.680]  I would be outraged.
[34:52.820 --> 34:55.000]  I can't wait, Geoff, for you to have that finished file,
[34:55.100 --> 34:58.000]  because we could just overlay it on footage of Niagara Falls
[34:58.000 --> 34:59.420]  and see how out of place it sounds.
[34:59.420 --> 35:01.720]  We have to upload it as an ASMR video.
[35:01.720 --> 35:05.680]  I was about to say, what if we did the most amazing, like,
[35:05.780 --> 35:10.220]  gentle fall asleep to natural earth sounds?
[35:10.400 --> 35:13.300]  But it's all pee and poo poo stuff.
[35:13.560 --> 35:14.520]  And people just don't know it.
[35:14.640 --> 35:14.980]  You know what?
[35:15.200 --> 35:19.120]  This is a perfect audio game for the listeners, too.
[35:19.280 --> 35:24.040]  Because we can maybe record some actual water sounds
[35:24.040 --> 35:27.320]  and then put yours in and see if anyone can tell the difference.
[35:27.760 --> 35:29.320]  What, like a guess the piss sort of thing?
[35:29.320 --> 35:32.600]  Yeah, well, like if Geoff does his waterfall piss thing,
[35:32.720 --> 35:35.380]  if we get some audio of real waterfalls,
[35:35.560 --> 35:38.380]  and then be like, which of these three are Geoff's piss
[35:38.380 --> 35:40.420]  to see if anyone can figure it out?
[35:40.700 --> 35:42.140]  I think everyone will figure it out.
[35:42.540 --> 35:43.200]  I don't think so.
[35:43.420 --> 35:43.960]  I don't know.
[35:44.420 --> 35:45.400]  That's like, I want to do that.
[35:45.480 --> 35:46.800]  I want to do a game called Who Farted,
[35:47.060 --> 35:49.300]  where we all record a fart just for it,
[35:49.300 --> 35:51.860]  and then we mix it up and we put it in jumbled order.
[35:51.940 --> 35:53.360]  And then everybody has to take the test to see
[35:53.360 --> 35:55.020]  if they can correctly identify all the farts,
[35:55.460 --> 35:56.540]  including their own.
[35:57.020 --> 35:58.400]  I have to get my CPAP out again.
[36:00.240 --> 36:02.900]  I meant to ask you that because you mentioned passingly.
[36:03.200 --> 36:04.900]  Recently, you're on the CPAP again.
[36:05.180 --> 36:06.440]  Did you ever solve that problem?
[36:06.820 --> 36:07.040]  No.
[36:07.040 --> 36:07.700]  You're just living with it.
[36:07.940 --> 36:09.700]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[36:09.800 --> 36:10.480]  I'm off it again.
[36:11.060 --> 36:12.260]  I just got full of air.
[36:12.340 --> 36:13.840]  I can't, I need to turn down,
[36:13.960 --> 36:15.300]  but they lock you out of all the settings.
[36:16.600 --> 36:17.440]  That's so funny.
[36:17.820 --> 36:20.240]  You need to put the person who charges 80 bucks
[36:20.240 --> 36:22.200]  to change the setting on it to do it.
[36:23.980 --> 36:26.260]  We're talking about a lot of things we might get into.
[36:26.260 --> 36:30.380]  Did you guys see the email TBG sent us this week?
[36:30.900 --> 36:32.140]  I haven't had a chance to look at it yet,
[36:32.160 --> 36:33.620]  but I saw that he sent a video.
[36:33.840 --> 36:34.320]  It was a good.
[36:34.520 --> 36:37.000]  Yes, it's so it is so good.
[36:37.280 --> 36:37.940]  I'll have to watch me.
[36:38.340 --> 36:40.900]  Let me post a link to it.
[36:41.120 --> 36:41.740]  Give me a second.
[36:42.580 --> 36:44.500]  He one of my favorite things of TBG
[36:44.500 --> 36:48.380]  is when he just sends us a random video about things.
[36:48.760 --> 36:51.460]  And this is specifically at us,
[36:51.460 --> 36:54.200]  as well as a talking point in general.
[36:54.600 --> 36:55.580]  So I'm going to post it.
[36:55.580 --> 36:56.340]  We can watch it.
[36:56.440 --> 36:57.160]  It's very short.
[36:57.240 --> 36:58.420]  It's only 53 seconds.
[36:59.160 --> 37:01.000]  And then we can we talk about it.
[37:01.940 --> 37:04.300]  I also have to the thing that I love about TBG.
[37:04.400 --> 37:08.360]  Sometimes it's hard to tell how intentional some of the stuff is
[37:08.360 --> 37:13.660]  because he has his comedic timing in this is insanely funny.
[37:14.320 --> 37:15.100]  He nails it.
[37:15.400 --> 37:16.740]  So this is the video right now.
[37:17.280 --> 37:17.980]  You want to watch?
[37:18.260 --> 37:20.780]  It's called Future Hobbies in the Green Life.
[37:21.400 --> 37:21.800]  It's black.
[37:21.900 --> 37:22.880]  Well, it's a serious video.
[37:23.280 --> 37:24.180]  All right, I'm starting it now.
[37:24.900 --> 37:26.200]  What's up, Face Team?
[37:26.280 --> 37:27.320]  It's your boy, TBG.
[37:27.620 --> 37:29.680]  I'm out here on another walk.
[37:30.060 --> 37:31.420]  I was thinking about one thing,
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.220]  and that's if you guys ever find yourself running from future hobbies.
[37:35.540 --> 37:37.260]  I feel like I see a lot of birds.
[37:39.460 --> 37:43.160]  And I've recently been like, you know, I'd like to get deeper into that.
[37:43.820 --> 37:47.540]  But then I get afraid that birding is like an old man hobby.
[37:48.280 --> 37:49.400]  And then I don't do it.
[37:50.140 --> 37:51.320]  But I probably should.
[37:51.320 --> 37:55.100]  You guys ever have hobbies that you feel that you don't do
[37:55.100 --> 37:58.960]  because you associate them with them just like a later stage of life?
[37:59.720 --> 38:00.900]  I just think about that a lot.
[38:01.060 --> 38:01.980]  Like fishing.
[38:03.720 --> 38:06.560]  I don't know if I want to be a fishing guy, but I like being outside.
[38:07.340 --> 38:08.240]  Quilting or sewing.
[38:08.580 --> 38:09.220]  I miss you guys.
[38:09.340 --> 38:10.360]  Hope you guys are doing well.
[38:11.040 --> 38:12.980]  Why am I running from my future hobby self?
[38:15.280 --> 38:16.120]  Should I get a kite?
[38:17.020 --> 38:18.000]  Should I get a kite?
[38:18.100 --> 38:18.680]  Kills me.
[38:18.680 --> 38:22.560]  Dude, I've been exactly where he is with the birding thing.
[38:22.760 --> 38:24.120]  I finally just embraced it.
[38:24.160 --> 38:26.080]  I've got a haiku box and everything.
[38:26.460 --> 38:28.800]  My yard records birds 24 hours a day.
[38:29.140 --> 38:30.420]  Get into it, TPG.
[38:30.560 --> 38:31.020]  It's awesome.
[38:31.520 --> 38:34.380]  Are there any hobbies that you ran from outside of birding?
[38:34.460 --> 38:36.660]  Or is that the one where you're like, I don't know.
[38:36.700 --> 38:37.880]  I don't know about this.
[38:39.720 --> 38:43.960]  I decided not to get back into comic books in my 40s.
[38:44.600 --> 38:45.480]  I thought about it briefly.
[38:45.540 --> 38:46.240]  So the reverse.
[38:46.240 --> 38:47.440]  I thought about it.
[38:47.500 --> 38:49.040]  And then I thought, no, no, no, no.
[38:49.040 --> 38:49.840]  I'm past this.
[38:50.140 --> 38:50.860]  I don't. I don't.
[38:50.960 --> 38:52.240]  I want to go back to this.
[38:53.180 --> 38:53.500]  Interesting.
[38:54.760 --> 38:55.840]  Oh, what was yours, Gracie?
[38:56.320 --> 38:57.700]  Gracie said she also had the reverse.
[38:58.680 --> 39:01.700]  Yeah, I saw this girl on TikTok who makes coloring books.
[39:01.700 --> 39:02.560]  And I was really tempted.
[39:02.720 --> 39:06.060]  Then I was like, well, I'm not five anymore.
[39:06.620 --> 39:07.840]  You should make coloring books.
[39:07.920 --> 39:08.220]  What do you mean?
[39:08.300 --> 39:10.460]  I think you should definitely make a coloring book, Gracie.
[39:10.480 --> 39:11.340]  Oh my God, of course.
[39:11.380 --> 39:12.080]  Can I tell you all a secret?
[39:12.200 --> 39:12.920]  I bought it anyway.
[39:13.000 --> 39:13.820]  And I do have it.
[39:15.920 --> 39:18.840]  This is cheating at the game.
[39:19.080 --> 39:20.100]  This is so creepy.
[39:21.120 --> 39:22.660]  No way I'm getting into this.
[39:22.780 --> 39:24.100]  By the way, I have it.
[39:25.160 --> 39:25.800]  Well, wait.
[39:26.140 --> 39:29.280]  And you were talking about getting potentially back into moon shoes at some point.
[39:29.340 --> 39:31.500]  So maybe you're just in an era of nostalgia.
[39:32.720 --> 39:37.660]  Yeah, no, I think every day I get a little closer to reverting to my childhood self.
[39:38.940 --> 39:40.720]  I feel like that's just what acting is.
[39:41.180 --> 39:42.280]  It's just like you're pretending.
[39:42.680 --> 39:45.740]  So when you're playing as a kid and making stuff up, it's the same thing,
[39:45.740 --> 39:47.160]  just on a larger scale.
[39:47.360 --> 39:48.760]  It's OK to revisit those.
[39:51.260 --> 39:51.860]  Do you?
[39:51.940 --> 39:52.320]  I don't think.
[39:52.800 --> 39:53.560]  Do you have one, Andrew?
[39:54.840 --> 39:55.900]  I'm trying to think of.
[39:56.460 --> 40:01.020]  I don't know if I have a passion that I was, I guess, video games,
[40:01.100 --> 40:03.480]  but that's not necessarily a kid specific thing.
[40:04.960 --> 40:06.540]  I'm trying to think of like a through line.
[40:07.020 --> 40:10.320]  A lot of things I got in and out of hobbies I've avoided because
[40:10.320 --> 40:13.660]  I never even occurred to me the idea that an old man hobby represents
[40:13.660 --> 40:14.960]  that I'm getting closer to death.
[40:15.760 --> 40:19.060]  I have more things where I'm like, oh, I wonder when I started caring about this.
[40:19.980 --> 40:21.020]  I really want to.
[40:21.100 --> 40:23.960]  I want to get a recliner like I want a lazy boy at some point.
[40:24.080 --> 40:27.540]  I got really excited thinking like I haven't looked into that world at all.
[40:27.640 --> 40:30.620]  And I bet you there's some crazy tech and the lazy boy.
[40:30.860 --> 40:33.760]  I wonder what the most expensive lazy boy does.
[40:34.300 --> 40:35.820]  You got to think it's like a massager.
[40:36.420 --> 40:39.580]  While you're looking that up, Gav, obviously, if I can jog your memory.
[40:39.580 --> 40:41.880]  I remember back this a couple of years ago.
[40:42.160 --> 40:43.560]  I don't think it was while we lived together.
[40:43.700 --> 40:44.640]  I think it was after we lived together.
[40:44.640 --> 40:48.100]  But I remember you were telling me that you always wanted to.
[40:48.280 --> 40:50.860]  You were like, I wouldn't say desperate to get into it.
[40:50.860 --> 40:54.400]  But you always were really intrigued by the idea of giving strange dudes
[40:54.400 --> 40:56.860]  hand jobs in like a public rest station.
[40:57.100 --> 40:58.840]  But you were scared to start.
[41:00.080 --> 41:01.420]  Is that the same thing?
[41:02.240 --> 41:03.660]  Do you guys think maybe?
[41:05.980 --> 41:07.620]  Was it 2012 again?
[41:10.700 --> 41:13.600]  Just thinking of hobbies that, you know, you're scared that you want to do,
[41:13.640 --> 41:14.500]  but you're scared to do it.
[41:14.580 --> 41:15.040]  I remember that being.
[41:15.120 --> 41:17.800]  Do you think he was afraid to start because he wouldn't be able to stop?
[41:17.920 --> 41:18.340]  I think so.
[41:18.340 --> 41:19.740]  I think that's where the fear came from.
[41:20.040 --> 41:22.540]  Yeah, I think the stopping would be out of his control.
[41:23.040 --> 41:24.380]  Yeah, I feel like that's on the other person.
[41:26.400 --> 41:27.760]  I think he just I think you were afraid.
[41:27.880 --> 41:28.280]  I don't remember.
[41:28.700 --> 41:29.580]  I'd have to go back.
[41:29.660 --> 41:31.180]  I wish we'd recorded this conversation.
[41:31.700 --> 41:35.780]  I just I just remember you being really into the idea of being scared that you'd get lost in it.
[41:35.780 --> 41:36.800]  You're an idiot.
[41:47.040 --> 41:48.280]  I was really intrigued there.
[41:48.340 --> 41:50.180]  I was like, oh, I wonder what I was trying to get into.
[41:50.360 --> 41:51.120]  Oh no.
[41:51.220 --> 41:52.260]  And then it was hand jobs.
[41:52.400 --> 41:56.660]  I was like, oh, no, it was a bit.
[41:58.900 --> 42:00.300]  He got me again.
[42:00.420 --> 42:03.520]  I thought I had another forgotten thing, like my forgotten life hack.
[42:03.520 --> 42:06.560]  I gotta keep you guessing.
[42:07.180 --> 42:08.900]  Oh, Geoff, you said you had a new life hack.
[42:09.840 --> 42:10.900]  Uh, did I?
[42:11.740 --> 42:14.340]  Yeah, when we were annoying Eric at the diner the other day.
[42:14.860 --> 42:17.280]  Oh, are you talking about the my banana thing?
[42:17.680 --> 42:18.300]  Oh, yeah.
[42:18.420 --> 42:19.560]  Was that not for F*** Face?
[42:20.140 --> 42:21.440]  Yeah, we already talked about it.
[42:21.480 --> 42:22.360]  What was my life hack?
[42:22.600 --> 42:23.420]  I don't remember it.
[42:24.340 --> 42:25.240]  The banana thing?
[42:25.240 --> 42:25.880]  It is the banana thing.
[42:25.940 --> 42:26.520]  The banana thing.
[42:26.640 --> 42:28.400]  No, the banana thing is for F*** Face.
[42:28.600 --> 42:29.940]  That if that's if that's it.
[42:30.240 --> 42:32.900]  Andrew, we've talked a lot about bananas in the past.
[42:32.900 --> 42:34.280]  No, wait, no time.
[42:34.400 --> 42:35.100]  Wait, time out.
[42:35.260 --> 42:36.460]  We've done the banana thing.
[42:36.740 --> 42:37.780]  What's the talk about the banana?
[42:38.220 --> 42:39.000]  What's the banana thing?
[42:39.380 --> 42:40.460]  Isn't about peels?
[42:40.640 --> 42:42.100]  Isn't it something to do peels?
[42:42.400 --> 42:42.860]  Absolutely not.
[42:43.120 --> 42:44.580]  Like, OK, go ahead.
[42:44.680 --> 42:45.040]  Never mind.
[42:45.180 --> 42:45.400]  All right.
[42:45.900 --> 42:46.860]  You didn't even remember what it was.
[42:46.900 --> 42:47.880]  You just thought peels.
[42:48.280 --> 42:52.520]  Well, I feel like we talked about bananas recently and I assumed it was one in the same.
[42:52.800 --> 42:53.520]  No, it's absolutely not.
[42:53.980 --> 42:57.180]  This is a it's not as he's not annoyed in this picture, but he's miffed.
[42:57.420 --> 42:57.980]  I can tell.
[42:58.360 --> 42:59.980]  Allow me to blow your mind.
[42:59.980 --> 43:04.380]  OK, y'all know how we've we've talked a lot about bananas in the past,
[43:04.480 --> 43:07.660]  how they're kind of a C plus fruit at best.
[43:07.920 --> 43:10.720]  Nice thing about a banana is it's always about as good as a banana is.
[43:10.880 --> 43:15.080]  Very rarely is a banana bad, but the ceiling for a banana is just low.
[43:15.560 --> 43:17.600]  Like there's no such thing as an A plus banana.
[43:18.240 --> 43:20.920]  You've never had a banana and said that's an A plus banana.
[43:21.020 --> 43:21.500]  But you've had a lot.
[43:21.600 --> 43:22.600]  I certainly haven't.
[43:22.640 --> 43:25.180]  You've had a lot of C plus or maybe B minus bananas.
[43:25.860 --> 43:27.760]  Sometimes a banana just hits the spot.
[43:27.760 --> 43:31.180]  Good bananas, but they're never better than a banana.
[43:31.400 --> 43:35.360]  The ceiling for a banana is not an A tier fruit.
[43:35.980 --> 43:36.840]  And I like bananas.
[43:37.280 --> 43:38.200]  I just don't like bananas.
[43:38.240 --> 43:39.400]  But I figured out a way.
[43:39.640 --> 43:42.220]  I figured out a way to break the banana ceiling, Andrew.
[43:43.400 --> 43:45.620]  OK, does it involve handjobs and bathrooms?
[43:45.620 --> 43:46.500]  No, no, no, no, no.
[43:46.520 --> 43:48.500]  This isn't. Get your head out of the gutter, man.
[43:48.600 --> 43:49.920]  Don't be Gavin in 2012.
[43:50.380 --> 43:51.780]  OK, I'll try.
[43:52.040 --> 43:53.280]  Here's what I would like to invent.
[43:53.280 --> 43:58.980]  I'm going to invent a metal straw that's similar in shape to a banana.
[43:59.760 --> 44:02.660]  And then what I want is what we're going to do is we're going to start taking bananas.
[44:02.780 --> 44:06.220]  We're going to peel them, you know, about a third of the way down,
[44:06.220 --> 44:07.860]  as you would do when you're about to eat a banana.
[44:08.020 --> 44:12.560]  And then you take that metal straw and you stick it in the head of the banana and you
[44:12.560 --> 44:17.740]  take it all the way down through the center till about, I'd say, eight tenths of the way
[44:17.740 --> 44:19.680]  down the banana, then pull it out.
[44:19.680 --> 44:24.040]  And what that's going to do is it's going to create a little hole through the center
[44:24.040 --> 44:27.540]  of the banana that runs all the way, almost all the way down, like a banana shaft, right?
[44:28.240 --> 44:33.160]  Then with that banana shaft, clean out the stick or get a different stick, insert it back in.
[44:33.260 --> 44:36.500]  And then through that stick, if you get a little funnel, if we need to, we can create
[44:36.500 --> 44:44.020]  a little banana funnel, pour in chocolate syrup or magic shell or caramel and then take
[44:44.020 --> 44:48.920]  the straw out. And then when you eat a banana, you've got a little bit of chocolate in you
[44:48.920 --> 44:51.780]  or a little bit of caramel in you, but it's in the middle of the banana.
[44:51.900 --> 44:55.020]  So it doesn't get on your hands. It doesn't get messy. It's self-contained.
[44:55.040 --> 44:58.800]  And if you want a frozen treat, stick it in the freezer for 15 minutes,
[44:58.800 --> 45:02.220]  and then you've got a crunchy chocolate center in the middle of your banana.
[45:03.140 --> 45:07.100]  Boom! We just flipped the banana world on its head.
[45:08.620 --> 45:13.280]  It feels very infomercially what you're describing, and I support that.
[45:13.800 --> 45:14.520]  I don't like bananas.
[45:14.520 --> 45:15.380]  Think about how it would taste.
[45:15.820 --> 45:16.740]  It would taste amazing!
[45:17.740 --> 45:19.580]  Yeah, I don't know. I just don't like bananas.
[45:20.140 --> 45:22.300]  I think we could do this. We could do this this week.
[45:22.520 --> 45:28.040]  I think the banana shaft is an idea that's desperate to come to fruition. I really do.
[45:28.300 --> 45:30.220]  I think everybody's going to be blown away.
[45:30.640 --> 45:33.300]  I'm a fan of the name banana shaft. That just sounds fun.
[45:33.620 --> 45:34.860]  That sounds like a good product.
[45:35.320 --> 45:39.580]  Think about it. You've seen people try to plus up a banana, right? They do it in Austin.
[45:39.680 --> 45:43.640]  You get a frozen banana that's dipped in chocolate or whatever, but that shit gets
[45:43.640 --> 45:44.960]  messy. It gets all over your hands.
[45:45.040 --> 45:47.340]  It's the same thing as like eating a drumstick or an ice cream cone.
[45:47.720 --> 45:53.120]  This, you get the structure of the banana, but all the flavors on the inside where it's not messy.
[45:53.320 --> 45:56.620]  And it's delivered perfectly to the inside of your mouth.
[45:56.780 --> 45:58.420]  Just enough. Just enough.
[45:58.760 --> 46:04.340]  Oh, I think it's gonna be... I think it's gonna... it might change the world.
[46:04.960 --> 46:06.500]  Why isn't everything messy on the inside?
[46:06.620 --> 46:09.020]  Why is the icing on the cake not in the inside?
[46:09.660 --> 46:11.700]  That's a great point, and maybe it should be, Gav.
[46:11.700 --> 46:13.780]  Maybe that's where we should be headed with this.
[46:13.960 --> 46:16.200]  I think all goo should be internal.
[46:18.720 --> 46:22.300]  Kind of like, uh, kind of like when you eat gum and then it's got the little, like, uh,
[46:22.320 --> 46:26.000]  or like a hard candy and it's got this, the gooey stuff in the center. Exactly.
[46:26.360 --> 46:26.900]  Yeah. Yeah.
[46:26.920 --> 46:31.200]  What about where do you fall on barbecue, though? Like ribs? How are you doing ribs?
[46:31.360 --> 46:32.940]  Oh, if the sauce was in the ribs? Oh!
[46:33.780 --> 46:35.460]  I don't know if I want that, honestly.
[46:35.600 --> 46:40.380]  In Texas, we don't have sauce. Everything is dry rub, so we... we don't need it.
[46:41.220 --> 46:43.140]  If the rub was in the ribs? Oh!
[46:43.900 --> 46:46.000]  Oh, no, an internal rib rub. That'd be interesting.
[46:47.260 --> 46:50.120]  Gracie said every time she eats a banana, she pukes.
[46:51.520 --> 46:52.380]  What's going on?
[46:53.120 --> 46:56.560]  I don't know. I think I might be allergic, but I just avoid them now.
[46:56.780 --> 46:57.600]  Can we have you eat one?
[46:58.360 --> 46:58.640]  No!
[47:00.120 --> 47:01.540]  And we'll just time how long...
[47:01.540 --> 47:02.120]  Why would I voluntarily do that?
[47:02.320 --> 47:03.920]  We'll just time how long you can keep it down.
[47:04.340 --> 47:08.660]  Gracie, if you were to eat a banana, if you were to eat a banana-shafted banana,
[47:08.660 --> 47:10.200]  recognizing that you don't eat bananas,
[47:10.300 --> 47:11.760]  but if you were to eat a banana-shafted banana,
[47:12.100 --> 47:15.880]  would you rather it have a caramel filling, a chocolate filling,
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.380]  or like a magic shell frozen filling?
[47:19.440 --> 47:21.040]  What do you think would be the most appealing to you?
[47:22.240 --> 47:24.160]  I mean, as a chocolate hater, caramel.
[47:24.560 --> 47:27.040]  Caramel, caramel. Okay, so if I could put...
[47:27.040 --> 47:30.200]  if I could shaft a banana full of caramel, do you think you'd give it a shot?
[47:32.780 --> 47:34.480]  I might fix bananas for you.
[47:34.500 --> 47:34.780]  Give it a shot.
[47:35.220 --> 47:35.480]  Okay.
[47:35.520 --> 47:37.540]  But it would be painful.
[47:38.620 --> 47:42.540]  I'm all for her doing this, for some reason being backed into a corner.
[47:42.760 --> 47:44.080]  You proposed that by saying,
[47:44.160 --> 47:47.740]  recognizing you don't like bananas and you don't want to eat one,
[47:47.940 --> 47:49.080]  but are you going to eat this?
[47:49.340 --> 47:50.800]  It's pretty fucking cool.
[47:51.180 --> 47:52.320]  That was really great.
[47:52.380 --> 47:54.920]  What if you caught out the banana and lined it with Pepto?
[47:56.200 --> 47:56.640]  Oh!
[47:58.680 --> 48:00.640]  And then it would settle your stomach on impact,
[48:00.920 --> 48:02.260]  and then the banana would stay down.
[48:03.840 --> 48:04.520]  Medicinal banana.
[48:04.520 --> 48:06.600]  Or what if we just stick a bunch of Tums in it?
[48:06.600 --> 48:08.980]  Yeah, line it with Tum goo.
[48:10.340 --> 48:12.160]  Well, there's not really goo involved.
[48:12.160 --> 48:13.520]  No, you can mash it up.
[48:14.040 --> 48:15.280]  They're very chalky.
[48:15.640 --> 48:16.080]  Powder?
[48:16.520 --> 48:19.380]  I'll just bite into a banana powder in the middle.
[48:20.140 --> 48:23.100]  Yeah, powder them up and then just get a bit of moisture and make a paste.
[48:23.420 --> 48:24.380]  And then we'll put the whole banana.
[48:24.460 --> 48:28.000]  We'll like, we'll like roll it in the powder and give it like a coating.
[48:28.540 --> 48:31.120]  But this is turning into something very different from the banana shaft.
[48:31.260 --> 48:31.740]  I just like...
[48:32.720 --> 48:35.740]  I'm totally on board with the medicinal Pepto banana.
[48:35.740 --> 48:36.720]  If you...
[48:36.720 --> 48:40.340]  When it started involving dry materials, I think...
[48:40.340 --> 48:42.800]  Well, the Pepto goes inside, the Tums go on the outside.
[48:42.980 --> 48:44.640]  That's probably OD on...
[48:44.640 --> 48:45.480]  You can't have Tums in Pepto.
[48:45.480 --> 48:49.220]  I was about to ask, do you think if you grinded up Tums and snorted it,
[48:49.280 --> 48:50.740]  would it have the same effect?
[48:51.580 --> 48:53.340]  Can it only be chewed?
[48:53.700 --> 48:54.380]  I think it...
[48:54.380 --> 48:54.620]  No.
[48:55.180 --> 48:55.560]  No?
[48:55.940 --> 48:56.260]  No.
[48:56.920 --> 48:57.560]  I think I'll try.
[48:57.680 --> 48:58.660]  I think it would go into your blood.
[48:58.980 --> 48:59.920]  It would probably work.
[49:01.180 --> 49:03.400]  Next time I wake up with heartburn,
[49:03.820 --> 49:06.940]  I'm going to grind up some Tums and snort it.
[49:07.580 --> 49:08.440]  Solve the problem.
[49:08.740 --> 49:12.280]  I think we should all go to the lab at some point over the weekend
[49:12.280 --> 49:13.860]  and try to create our own banana shaft.
[49:14.680 --> 49:15.620]  So what are we using?
[49:15.700 --> 49:18.580]  We need a uniform item to core out that we can all get hold of.
[49:18.640 --> 49:19.980]  I'm just going to use like a...
[49:20.980 --> 49:23.260]  Either a straw or...
[49:23.260 --> 49:24.000]  What are you going to get around the corner?
[49:25.620 --> 49:26.620]  Uh, I don't know.
[49:26.680 --> 49:27.920]  I'll just try to like straighten the banana.
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  It's not going to be ideal, but you know, just make do with what you got.
[49:31.160 --> 49:32.420]  That's a part of it's going to...
[49:32.420 --> 49:34.360]  This is the process is like figuring it out, right?
[49:35.140 --> 49:38.220]  I have some straws like that.
[49:38.420 --> 49:39.520]  I have some straws like that.
[49:39.660 --> 49:40.320]  Can I borrow one?
[49:40.780 --> 49:41.740]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[49:42.840 --> 49:43.160]  Okay.
[49:44.420 --> 49:45.420]  I'll have to think about this.
[49:45.660 --> 49:48.860]  That is the exact straw I was thinking of when I pitched this.
[49:48.980 --> 49:51.660]  Yeah, because you can kind of go in and then give it like a little curve, you know?
[49:51.780 --> 49:51.840]  Yeah.
[49:52.060 --> 49:54.560]  Should we then all meet up and present a...
[49:54.560 --> 49:56.760]  Why can't I say present a bananas?
[49:57.020 --> 49:58.060]  Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[49:58.520 --> 50:00.480]  I mean, we're not going to do it together.
[50:00.480 --> 50:03.440]  We're going to do it independently and then bring bananas to each other.
[50:03.680 --> 50:04.260]  Open bananas.
[50:06.060 --> 50:09.080]  I'd rather we do it here so I can see what everyone does.
[50:09.240 --> 50:10.060]  All right, that makes sense.
[50:10.580 --> 50:12.340]  So we'll present the next day anyway.
[50:14.460 --> 50:16.040]  I want to be part of the experience.
[50:16.200 --> 50:17.660]  But that's if you want to...
[50:17.660 --> 50:20.340]  If you want to box me out, that's fine.
[50:20.660 --> 50:26.280]  British Jackal trying to box me out again.
[50:26.720 --> 50:27.500]  It's fine.
[50:27.740 --> 50:29.200]  You'd be on a little laptop.
[50:29.560 --> 50:30.180]  That's fine.
[50:30.920 --> 50:32.460]  We'll figure it out offline.
[50:32.620 --> 50:37.580]  We don't have to figure out the British Jackal once again.
[50:38.380 --> 50:38.840]  You mean Gracie?
[50:39.420 --> 50:40.400]  No, Gracie's great.
[50:41.480 --> 50:43.180]  I have to come up with a new name for you.
[50:44.740 --> 50:45.740]  Let me think about it.
[50:46.300 --> 50:49.180]  The people really took to Gracie becoming the British Jackal.
[50:49.220 --> 50:49.880]  It's a great name.
[50:50.000 --> 50:50.600]  It's such a good name.
[50:50.760 --> 50:54.260]  To go from Metal Snake, which was so strong to British Jackal is unbelievable.
[50:54.620 --> 50:57.860]  I don't think anyone's had as good nicknames at this company.
[50:57.860 --> 51:02.740]  No, to out of the gate with two just absolute bangers of nicknames.
[51:02.820 --> 51:03.520]  That's pretty impressive.
[51:04.180 --> 51:09.140]  They also really took to my picture of how full my bathtub was.
[51:10.060 --> 51:14.240]  You took that picture like a fucking crazy person.
[51:14.420 --> 51:16.500]  Like, of course, they were going to come at it.
[51:16.880 --> 51:20.120]  Gavin specifically said, put your arm in it.
[51:20.140 --> 51:23.980]  Put your hand flat on the bottom so that we can see where the water hits on your arm.
[51:24.640 --> 51:27.060]  And then everybody else was jumping to conclusions,
[51:27.240 --> 51:29.980]  saying that I didn't want to put my feet on the internet, which I don't.
[51:31.460 --> 51:33.720]  But there was a reason I did it the way I did it.
[51:34.500 --> 51:36.680]  I was just pulling away that your head was in it.
[51:36.920 --> 51:37.680]  And you did it backwards.
[51:37.940 --> 51:38.700]  You did like a selfie.
[51:39.120 --> 51:40.780]  With like an aggressive...
[51:40.780 --> 51:42.020]  I didn't know how else to get...
[51:42.580 --> 51:44.240]  I wasn't going to do a selfie timer.
[51:44.840 --> 51:46.220]  And flick it to the wide lens or something.
[51:46.480 --> 51:46.880]  Oh.
[51:49.840 --> 51:51.720]  Well, that's what we put it that way.
[51:52.980 --> 51:53.460]  Oh.
[51:54.220 --> 51:56.020]  When you put it that way, I couldn't.
[51:57.100 --> 51:58.720]  But look what we got out of it.
[51:59.560 --> 52:02.440]  Yeah. I mean, at no point was I mad. It was amazing.
[52:02.900 --> 52:03.660]  No, it's great.
[52:03.780 --> 52:04.620]  Like a psychopath.
[52:05.080 --> 52:10.620]  I realized the audience had an extreme love for Gracie.
[52:10.860 --> 52:14.420]  We did a trivia tournament and Gracie cheated during it
[52:14.420 --> 52:17.160]  and admitted that she had cheated and still failed.
[52:17.160 --> 52:22.240]  And I thought people are going to be so outraged about this cheating.
[52:22.420 --> 52:24.380]  And all of the comments were,
[52:24.940 --> 52:29.700]  that game fucked Gracie. She used the lifeline and it gave her the wrong answer.
[52:29.900 --> 52:31.220]  That's some bullshit.
[52:31.560 --> 52:33.740]  We got some justice for Gracie going on.
[52:34.100 --> 52:36.620]  There was justice for Gracie when she cheated.
[52:36.980 --> 52:38.820]  She cheated the game.
[52:39.320 --> 52:39.880]  What do you mean?
[52:40.400 --> 52:42.100]  I love the audience. We've got the best audience.
[52:43.280 --> 52:44.620]  This makes no sense.
[52:44.880 --> 52:45.940]  You can never predict.
[52:46.280 --> 52:46.540]  Yeah.
[52:47.240 --> 52:49.400]  There's one of the Gracie photo.
[52:50.320 --> 52:51.980]  The shark is the background.
[52:53.340 --> 52:58.460]  I know I've already pitched a whole piss thing.
[52:59.060 --> 53:02.160]  And then I pitched a banana shaft to you guys.
[53:02.240 --> 53:05.400]  But I have one other idea I'd like to throw away before the end of the episode.
[53:05.700 --> 53:10.560]  I think this is an opportunity for us to go viral. Extremely viral.
[53:11.560 --> 53:16.340]  And I just want to throw it out there and see how you guys feel about it.
[53:16.340 --> 53:19.960]  I woke up the other night from a dead ass sleep with this idea.
[53:20.340 --> 53:21.300]  Like four in the morning.
[53:21.700 --> 53:22.700]  First thing that came to mind.
[53:22.800 --> 53:27.280]  I woke up and thought, how come you never see NBA stars holding pets?
[53:28.340 --> 53:29.560]  Like, think about it.
[53:30.780 --> 53:31.980]  Think about Shaq.
[53:32.160 --> 53:33.500]  Shaq's like seven feet tall.
[53:33.660 --> 53:36.500]  But you've never seen him hold like a kitty cat.
[53:37.040 --> 53:39.280]  Or like Chris Dabs Porzingis is like 7'3".
[53:39.280 --> 53:40.940]  Or Chet Holmgren who's like 7'2".
[53:40.940 --> 53:45.180]  But you never see them like playing with a ferret or a bunny rabbit.
[53:45.680 --> 53:48.520]  They would look so comically small in their hands.
[53:49.280 --> 53:50.820]  Then it hit me.
[53:51.160 --> 53:55.200]  Victor Wimbenyama, most promising star, future of the NBA.
[53:55.920 --> 53:57.320]  I googled it.
[53:57.440 --> 53:59.300]  I don't think he's ever been photographed holding...
[53:59.300 --> 54:00.180]  Oh, see, that's perfect.
[54:00.480 --> 54:01.500]  Shaq and the cat is perfect.
[54:01.700 --> 54:04.800]  That's a full grown tiger in Shaq's arms right there.
[54:05.880 --> 54:09.620]  What if we got Victor Wimbenyama...
[54:10.220 --> 54:15.000]  We started a campaign to get Victor Wimbenyama to hold a chihuahua in his hands.
[54:15.180 --> 54:18.140]  And we can call it hashtag Wimby Wawa.
[54:21.660 --> 54:22.060]  Oh...
[54:22.540 --> 54:23.160]  Okay, yeah.
[54:23.200 --> 54:23.900]  So thoughts, guys?
[54:23.980 --> 54:24.260]  Go ahead.
[54:24.580 --> 54:25.160]  I'm all for it.
[54:25.260 --> 54:26.620]  I heard some of this idea the other day.
[54:26.700 --> 54:27.240]  I wanted to get...
[54:27.760 --> 54:31.300]  My suggestion was Kevin Durant and he would just hold an ant.
[54:31.680 --> 54:31.940]  Yeah.
[54:32.360 --> 54:32.580]  Yeah.
[54:32.920 --> 54:34.040]  Well, that works well.
[54:34.240 --> 54:36.580]  I like Victor Wimbenyama because he's close.
[54:36.760 --> 54:37.140]  He's just...
[54:37.140 --> 54:38.200]  Yeah, he's close in Texas.
[54:38.360 --> 54:39.720]  There's a lot of chihuahuas in Texas.
[54:40.080 --> 54:41.900]  The chihuahua is the smallest dog.
[54:42.220 --> 54:43.620]  He's like the biggest dude.
[54:44.040 --> 54:44.860]  Wimby Wawa.
[54:44.860 --> 54:49.000]  He could just hold it in his hands and it would look so comically tiny.
[54:49.260 --> 54:50.240]  And it would be so cute.
[54:50.460 --> 54:53.580]  What's cuter than NBA stars with cute little pets?
[54:53.840 --> 54:57.580]  And then we just find pets that are appropriate for different NBA stars' names.
[54:57.880 --> 55:01.120]  And then we just start up a social campaign.
[55:01.360 --> 55:03.780]  And before long, you know the San Antonio Spurs are going to see it.
[55:03.780 --> 55:05.940]  And they're going to go, listen, we are in last fucking place right now.
[55:06.200 --> 55:10.520]  Anything we can do to get eyes on the Spurs right now while we have this Wimby phenomenon.
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.200]  And then boom, there you go.
[55:12.880 --> 55:16.020]  Well, my first, my two immediate thoughts are one.
[55:16.500 --> 55:21.080]  If there is ever a time to start a new series at Rooster Teeth, this certainly is it.
[55:21.400 --> 55:22.220]  It's great timing.
[55:22.440 --> 55:23.460]  Big fan of that.
[55:23.900 --> 55:29.220]  Also, I think it's very funny to pitch and film a video with Victor Wimbyana
[55:29.220 --> 55:32.840]  for a website that will not exist by the time it is done.
[55:33.100 --> 55:35.860]  Well, maybe we don't start it until the new thing flips over.
[55:35.940 --> 55:38.680]  Maybe we hold off on our viral moment and for like a month.
[55:39.860 --> 55:40.340]  Sure.
[55:40.680 --> 55:40.980]  Okay.
[55:40.980 --> 55:42.920]  I just think we got to strike while the iron's hot.
[55:43.100 --> 55:43.880]  Season's almost over.
[55:44.180 --> 55:45.180]  They're not going to be in the playoffs,
[55:45.500 --> 55:49.040]  although it's an interesting way to get some eyes on the Spurs
[55:49.040 --> 55:50.940]  while all the other teams are playing in the playoffs.
[55:50.940 --> 55:52.500]  And they're sitting at home.
[55:52.580 --> 55:54.040]  He'll have a lot of free time on his hands.
[55:54.320 --> 55:57.100]  And all he has to do is put a chihuahua in his hands.
[55:57.100 --> 55:59.520]  And then boom, the world will notice.
[56:00.040 --> 56:02.500]  Should reach out and really make sure that he knows
[56:02.500 --> 56:05.560]  that you recently won a trivia thing at a baseball game.
[56:05.580 --> 56:06.960]  I think that'll really impress him.
[56:06.960 --> 56:07.820]  Round Rock Express.
[56:08.440 --> 56:11.020]  And that I've run out the San Antonio Brahmas,
[56:11.300 --> 56:15.080]  a local peer team to the San Antonio Spurs.
[56:15.900 --> 56:16.520]  It's true.
[56:17.780 --> 56:19.340]  There are multiple leagues now, right?
[56:19.560 --> 56:24.180]  Yeah, I'm like locally known in San Antonio sports parts.
[56:25.160 --> 56:27.220]  As a sports game attendant.
[56:28.560 --> 56:31.580]  I've attended multiple games in the San Antonio area.
[56:32.180 --> 56:33.660]  Why is it attendee and not attendant?
[56:34.540 --> 56:36.760]  Because the attendant is the person who takes the tickets.
[56:37.360 --> 56:39.120]  What makes an attendant super?
[56:40.580 --> 56:42.700]  Yeah, why do other jobs not have super?
[56:43.680 --> 56:45.140]  Like super producer.
[56:46.300 --> 56:49.020]  Eric, I think we should all agree that Eric
[56:49.020 --> 56:51.720]  should only be referred to as super producer from here on out.
[56:52.740 --> 56:53.560]  I like that.
[56:53.880 --> 56:54.660]  Thank you very much.
[56:54.800 --> 56:57.820]  I just found out superintendent is one word and not two words.
[56:58.100 --> 56:58.760]  That's pretty exciting.
[56:58.760 --> 56:59.460]  It is, yeah.
[56:59.500 --> 57:02.860]  I thought I was looking up what a regular intendant was.
[57:03.060 --> 57:05.380]  And that's just simply not a word.
[57:06.460 --> 57:09.200]  So I don't know if super producer really fits, but I'll take it.
[57:09.320 --> 57:09.620]  Thank you.
[57:09.920 --> 57:11.480]  Why don't you take intendant?
[57:11.720 --> 57:14.000]  I suppose I could.
[57:15.440 --> 57:17.440]  It's just it's spelled different.
[57:18.020 --> 57:19.660]  This is Eric, he's our intendant.
[57:20.380 --> 57:23.540]  The administrator of an opera house or theater.
[57:23.820 --> 57:25.640]  That's kind of appropriate.
[57:26.540 --> 57:28.760]  This is kind of theater, theater of the mind, if you will.
[57:29.140 --> 57:30.640]  Yeah, I won't.
[57:31.980 --> 57:33.660]  If you will, I won't.
[57:39.900 --> 57:40.620]  I won't.
[57:41.960 --> 57:42.680]  I'm excited.
[57:42.840 --> 57:45.280]  I get to I get to record a bunch of pee and inject.
[57:45.580 --> 57:48.640]  We all get to inject caramel and chocolate into bananas.
[57:48.820 --> 57:52.260]  And we got to figure out a way to get a seven foot five tall man to hold a chihuahua.
[57:52.380 --> 57:53.120]  I feel like there's...
[57:53.120 --> 57:53.660]  Now there's...
[57:53.660 --> 57:57.860]  Wait, before we wrap up, I just want to clarify for this.
[57:58.080 --> 57:59.300]  Does it have to be a banana?
[57:59.760 --> 58:00.780]  Could it be another?
[58:01.360 --> 58:02.720]  Could it be a different product?
[58:02.720 --> 58:07.100]  If I have a different vision, but for the same idea, I'd rather do something.
[58:07.340 --> 58:07.460]  Okay.
[58:07.800 --> 58:11.000]  I don't know that it would be considered a banana shaft if it's not a banana.
[58:11.140 --> 58:15.160]  No, but you know, I think it's important to corner a market, right?
[58:15.540 --> 58:17.660]  Well, they've already done that with hot dogs and cheese.
[58:17.800 --> 58:18.520]  They've already done that.
[58:18.580 --> 58:20.480]  Cheese dogs are the fucking bomb.
[58:23.840 --> 58:28.060]  Gracie's idea is to remove the hot dog from the corn dog.
[58:28.180 --> 58:28.580]  No!
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.140]  Just use the coating of the corn dog.
[58:32.120 --> 58:33.680]  Yeah, like just that good batter.
[58:34.240 --> 58:37.980]  Instead of bread crumbing an item, you want to use one from a hot dog.
[58:38.480 --> 58:39.120]  From a corn dog.
[58:39.260 --> 58:41.360]  Like every once in a while, you get a hollow Whopper,
[58:41.780 --> 58:43.740]  and it just like collapses on itself when you eat it.
[58:45.060 --> 58:45.380]  What?
[58:45.760 --> 58:47.520]  You know, Whoppers, those candies, Whoppers.
[58:47.680 --> 58:49.940]  Oh, I thought you meant from a burger.
[58:50.640 --> 58:51.360]  Oh, sorry.
[58:51.500 --> 58:54.380]  No, Whoppers, like molten milk balls, like those things.
[58:54.500 --> 58:54.920]  Every once in a while.
[58:54.920 --> 58:55.220]  Yeah.
[58:55.360 --> 58:55.660]  Okay.
[58:55.760 --> 58:56.280]  No, I get it.
[58:56.280 --> 58:56.820]  I get it now.
[58:57.080 --> 58:57.160]  Yeah.
[58:57.380 --> 59:00.320]  You know when you get a Big Mac and sometimes the buttons don't do up?
[59:02.840 --> 59:04.700]  At least my thing was called a Whopper.
[59:05.940 --> 59:08.880]  Yeah, it just is a much less known Whopper.
[59:08.980 --> 59:10.480]  It depends on what part you're in, I guess.
[59:10.720 --> 59:12.580]  I hear, from what I hear, people don't like Burger King.
[59:12.900 --> 59:14.240]  I don't know anybody that doesn't like Whoppers.
[59:15.440 --> 59:16.640]  You don't like Whoppers?
[59:17.220 --> 59:19.180]  Oh, you mean the candy, not the hamburger still.
[59:19.460 --> 59:20.140]  I understand.
[59:20.360 --> 59:21.040]  It's just confusing.
[59:21.240 --> 59:22.460]  This is why you have to refer to it.
[59:22.580 --> 59:23.460]  Well, no, I am.
[59:23.560 --> 59:27.680]  It's just that part really got, this is why I refer to it as Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic Burger.
[59:28.020 --> 59:30.060]  So it's like, you just, you can tell them apart.
[59:30.200 --> 59:30.640]  You know what I mean?
[59:30.640 --> 59:32.180]  Everybody likes a Whopper candy.
[59:32.780 --> 59:33.500]  See, that's great.
[59:33.740 --> 59:34.520]  Are they like Maltesers?
[59:34.780 --> 59:35.080]  Yes.
[59:35.460 --> 59:36.440]  Yeah, they are like Maltesers.
[59:36.840 --> 59:37.380]  Yeah, same thing.
[59:37.500 --> 59:38.480]  I wonder which one is better.
[59:38.500 --> 59:39.420]  I don't like Maltesers.
[59:39.700 --> 59:41.200]  I don't like Maltesers, I like Whoppers.
[59:41.440 --> 59:43.560]  Malted Milk Duds, Milk Duds, those are good.
[59:43.760 --> 59:45.200]  Or Malted Milk Balls, is that what they're called?
[59:45.460 --> 59:46.280]  There's another brand too.
[59:46.640 --> 59:47.400]  What is Malt?
[59:48.360 --> 59:49.680]  Uh, what is Malt?
[59:50.100 --> 59:51.640]  It's the next rating after Super.
[59:52.020 --> 59:53.420]  It goes Super, then Malt.
[59:53.960 --> 59:54.680]  Malt Intendant.
[59:54.920 --> 59:56.040]  Oh, this is about to be a letdown.
[59:56.040 --> 01:00:01.240]  It is a cereal grain that has been made to germinate by soaking in water
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:05.160]  and then stopped from germination further by drying with hot air.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:06.260]  Ew.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.560]  So it's like Blue Bulls cereal?
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.140]  Yeah, it's like edged cereal.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:14.460]  It's edged cereal, it's been gooning like crazy,
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:18.880]  and now you have to eat it in candy shape?
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:19.740]  That's all you.
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:20.620]  You got it.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:25.080]  All right, we need to wrap this up now on that note, I guess.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.100]  All right.
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:30.840]  Well, thanks for listening to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:34.160]  This has been episode 203.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.560]  We hope you had a good time.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.020]  We sure enjoyed talking at you.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.660]  And why don't you check back next week because we'll be here
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:43.440]  and we'll be saying a bunch of other dumb shit.
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.060]  Until then, bye.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:45.920]  Bye.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.340]  Andrew said no.
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.380]  Listen, my throat is sore.
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:55.700]  We don't need to all say bye at the end of every episode.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.080]  You two both said it.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:57.980]  It's fine.
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:00:59.580]  Bye.
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:00.860]  Bye.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.960]  See, that was so late.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.960]  That's going to be on the beginning of next week's episode.
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:13.740]  Hey, guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.880]  Of course, they aren't ahead in recording yet.
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:20.320]  So instead of guessing next week's episode, I'm going to guess what they said in this episode.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.800]  Geoff mourned the loss of OJ Simpson.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.860]  Eric talks about how the cookbooks are in people's hands.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.340]  Andrew remembers a recipe he meant to put in that cookbook.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.300]  Gavin is confused about a legal matter.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.040]  The British Jackal once again steals the spotlight.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.680]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.120]  All that and more was on this week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.880]  Who knows what happens next week.
