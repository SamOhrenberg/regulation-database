[00:10.100 --> 00:13.380]  Can I ask you a question, Andrew? I keep seeing this pop up.
[00:13.720 --> 00:17.440]  Uh, and I figure, I mean, it doesn't have to be on the show because it doesn't really matter or whatever.
[00:17.600 --> 00:17.820]  Sure.
[00:17.960 --> 00:20.620]  How do you read this? I don't understand.
[00:21.500 --> 00:21.940]  Uh...
[00:21.940 --> 00:23.180]  I don't understand how...
[00:23.180 --> 00:26.460]  Regular clean, plus clean, super clean.
[00:26.560 --> 00:28.540]  No, no, no. Shut up. Shut up.
[00:29.080 --> 00:32.860]  The price is $179.99? What is...
[00:32.860 --> 00:33.220]  Okay.
[00:34.140 --> 00:34.860]  Oh, what is that?
[00:35.140 --> 00:35.880]  $179.99?
[00:36.560 --> 00:37.220]  I don't understand.
[00:38.240 --> 00:38.980]  What does that mean?
[00:39.700 --> 00:40.480]  $179 what?
[00:42.460 --> 00:43.540]  I have no idea.
[00:45.760 --> 00:46.300]  $179...
[00:47.420 --> 00:51.340]  $179.99. $199.99. $209.99. What is that?
[00:51.740 --> 00:54.620]  How is it $212?
[00:55.040 --> 00:56.660]  What currency is that in?
[00:56.920 --> 01:01.180]  That's what I'm asking. How is it $209 what? $209 what?
[01:01.460 --> 01:04.500]  Canadian dollars for one gallon of gas? Is it that expensive?
[01:06.440 --> 01:06.980]  Oh...
[01:07.580 --> 01:08.400]  Do you not...
[01:08.400 --> 01:08.980]  What?
[01:09.840 --> 01:11.600]  I've never thought about this.
[01:12.040 --> 01:14.280]  What do you mean? What do you mean?
[01:14.680 --> 01:18.720]  I don't drive. I'm not a... I don't have a car. Well, I own a car, but I don't drive it.
[01:18.720 --> 01:19.000]  But like...
[01:19.680 --> 01:21.880]  But like, look. Okay, here, here, here, here.
[01:22.020 --> 01:23.860]  I think cents. I think it's in cents.
[01:25.340 --> 01:25.700]  Oh...
[01:25.700 --> 01:27.880]  Because look, as an example, I put the American...
[01:27.880 --> 01:29.560]  Here's just an example of an American one.
[01:29.900 --> 01:34.180]  That you would easily read as $4.84.
[01:34.980 --> 01:39.440]  So $1.799 would be $1.79.9.
[01:39.960 --> 01:42.000]  If it was cents. It says cents per liter.
[01:43.140 --> 01:43.700]  Oh...
[01:43.700 --> 01:44.340]  What?
[01:44.480 --> 01:47.740]  What the fuck? That's crazy.
[01:48.760 --> 01:51.820]  Yeah. I never thought about what the currency is.
[01:52.280 --> 01:53.160]  You're right. That is odd.
[01:54.720 --> 02:02.080]  It's 100... Okay, so I'm going to go and say my gas is 199 pennies per liter.
[02:02.080 --> 02:05.100]  Well, if you're bragging about affording 89...
[02:05.100 --> 02:08.420]  We got rid of the penny years ago.
[02:08.580 --> 02:12.100]  So it's kind of crazy that we're still using that for gas.
[02:12.740 --> 02:15.980]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[02:16.320 --> 02:16.360]  Oh, no.
[02:17.000 --> 02:17.300]  What?
[02:17.880 --> 02:20.240]  You sounded like a previous boy there.
[02:20.260 --> 02:24.620]  Oh, I'm still recovering from my cold I had a week ago.
[02:24.720 --> 02:25.740]  Oh, you got sick, too?
[02:25.780 --> 02:26.880]  We were talking about it earlier.
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.520]  Yeah, I was sick for one day, but I have not had a cough for like three weeks.
[02:30.520 --> 02:31.300]  Sweet.
[02:31.700 --> 02:33.720]  Andrew complaining about how someone sounds?
[02:34.560 --> 02:36.140]  No, no, I wasn't complaining.
[02:36.340 --> 02:39.220]  That was I was making fun of two different things.
[02:39.360 --> 02:43.200]  This is episode 204.
[02:43.960 --> 02:45.460]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[02:46.020 --> 02:52.160]  I'm the offended. With me, as always, Gavin Free and the offender, Andrew Panton, who's making fun of me.
[02:52.300 --> 02:54.360]  I was just in that moment.
[02:55.580 --> 02:56.860]  It's factually correct.
[02:57.360 --> 02:58.620]  I'm not going to run from it.
[02:58.820 --> 02:59.600]  How do you still sound like this?
[02:59.600 --> 03:00.860]  Well, this is what happened.
[03:01.440 --> 03:06.260]  So I was starting to get better and then not to be too vulgar.
[03:06.720 --> 03:13.660]  I keep when I'm on the edge of getting better, accidentally triggering my gag reflex and then coughing up like a bunch of acid.
[03:14.960 --> 03:16.800]  And it hurts the throat.
[03:16.940 --> 03:17.680]  So then I reset.
[03:18.400 --> 03:19.360]  This happened twice.
[03:19.360 --> 03:20.320]  How strong is your acid?
[03:20.820 --> 03:22.280]  Oh, listen, I'm an acid-y boy.
[03:22.780 --> 03:23.520]  Okay, I got it.
[03:24.120 --> 03:25.840]  You ever seen Aliens?
[03:27.080 --> 03:29.360]  I'm not there, but I'm close.
[03:29.860 --> 03:34.780]  Do you think if you chundered a little bit, if you boked on your floor, do you think it would go to the floor below?
[03:35.000 --> 03:35.640]  I don't know.
[03:35.740 --> 03:36.340]  I'm not there yet.
[03:36.600 --> 03:43.060]  I'm like, if I did like one of those 23andMe or whatever DNA thing, I'm probably like 3% xenomorph.
[03:43.760 --> 03:47.020]  I'm not enough where it's like the floor is melting, but...
[03:47.020 --> 03:49.640]  Well, they'd never be able to tell because it would melt through the vial.
[03:50.060 --> 03:52.620]  HR Deeger has never drawn a picture of you.
[03:52.700 --> 03:53.920]  You're not that alien yet.
[03:54.100 --> 03:54.220]  Yeah.
[03:54.220 --> 03:55.040]  Yeah.
[03:56.540 --> 04:00.680]  I was maybe, though, on the street when he had the inspiration for it.
[04:00.760 --> 04:01.940]  I was part of...
[04:02.680 --> 04:05.360]  Not me specifically, but shades of me.
[04:05.640 --> 04:10.420]  I bet you wouldn't eat through the floor, but I bet it might take a little varnish off a wooden floor, maybe.
[04:10.700 --> 04:13.320]  Probably, yeah. I think that's a good call.
[04:13.540 --> 04:15.140]  Gus used to melt through his laptops.
[04:15.540 --> 04:19.500]  Dude, Gus has the most acidic skin on Earth.
[04:19.600 --> 04:20.640]  It's so fucking weird.
[04:20.640 --> 04:24.760]  He would rub the metal off of his laptops.
[04:24.980 --> 04:27.280]  Look at any Macbook that dude's ever owned.
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.100]  That sounds dangerous.
[04:30.740 --> 04:32.280]  Yeah, eventually. That's why he used to get new laptops.
[04:32.880 --> 04:35.940]  I don't think he could professionally arm wrestle, even if he wanted to.
[04:36.180 --> 04:36.980]  That'd just take a toll.
[04:37.160 --> 04:38.020]  You think he'd be disqualified?
[04:38.220 --> 04:39.660]  I think so. I think it'd be illegal.
[04:40.900 --> 04:42.740]  His acidic levels...
[04:44.260 --> 04:45.500]  slowly melt through the skin.
[04:46.020 --> 04:46.560]  I got a clip.
[04:47.500 --> 04:47.960]  Oh, what?
[04:47.960 --> 04:50.460]  That one coming in hot.
[04:50.720 --> 04:54.220]  Coming in hot with a clip, just because, you know, it's been a part of the plot for a while.
[04:55.460 --> 04:56.260]  A recording.
[04:56.580 --> 04:57.700]  A plot for a while.
[04:57.920 --> 04:59.460]  From the Rooster Teeth podcast.
[04:59.940 --> 05:00.280]  Oh!
[05:03.540 --> 05:04.340]  Episode 39.
[05:06.520 --> 05:07.220]  Here we go.
[05:07.880 --> 05:09.740]  But it's a two and a half hour long movie.
[05:09.780 --> 05:11.640]  You just described every Roller Coaster movie.
[05:11.700 --> 05:15.380]  Yeah, yeah, pretty much. I mean, like, you know, the animators had a field day with that.
[05:15.380 --> 05:19.760]  Like, okay, we needed to blow up Las Vegas by, you know, an earthquake and sandstorm.
[05:20.040 --> 05:20.440]  Okay.
[05:20.620 --> 05:21.520]  Spoiler alert.
[05:22.600 --> 05:24.260]  It's in the trailer. Come on now.
[05:24.260 --> 05:25.620]  Oh, no, I'm ruined.
[05:25.840 --> 05:31.180]  It's like we, like, it's, that whole movie is, thank God we weren't standing where we were ten seconds ago.
[05:31.480 --> 05:33.220]  Like, that's the whole movie.
[05:35.980 --> 05:37.100]  That's a different joke?
[05:37.360 --> 05:37.580]  That's a different joke?
[05:37.580 --> 05:37.860]  Totally different.
[05:37.860 --> 05:38.600]  Oh my God.
[05:39.120 --> 05:41.760]  How's that a different joke? Let me, let me post your joke.
[05:42.880 --> 05:43.160]  Okay.
[05:43.160 --> 05:49.180]  Listen, I'm, I'm not necessarily a fan of jumping in front of this bullet of Jack.
[05:49.600 --> 05:50.340]  Let me, uh...
[05:50.340 --> 05:54.240]  He's the offender and Jack's defendant. It's, it's a different side of the internet.
[05:54.240 --> 05:56.440]  Andrew Panton is the official offender-defendant.
[05:56.860 --> 05:59.440]  Oh, no, that's the wrong, sorry, wrong.
[06:01.240 --> 06:02.740]  Is that a sloppy face?
[06:02.920 --> 06:03.900]  That was the wrong one.
[06:04.080 --> 06:05.220]  That's Alan Wake 2.
[06:05.400 --> 06:07.700]  It's the guy's dick in Alan Wake 2.
[06:07.700 --> 06:10.840]  Why'd you, why'd you always hit the wrong button?
[06:12.700 --> 06:15.260]  That's the exact same fucking joke.
[06:15.360 --> 06:17.680]  Yeah, it was. Nevermind, I was wrong. I was wrong about it.
[06:18.080 --> 06:23.380]  The tweet, the tweet is... well, Gavin, you can say it. It's your, it's your fucking words.
[06:23.860 --> 06:28.300]  Uh, the tweet was, 2012 should have been called, I'm glad I'm not ten feet behind where I am right now.
[06:29.540 --> 06:30.740]  Man, I have...
[06:30.740 --> 06:37.180]  The funny thing is, though, there's also a clip from the Rooster Teeth podcast, episode 63.
[06:38.000 --> 06:38.340]  Really?
[06:38.340 --> 06:41.480]  About six months later. Check this out.
[06:41.760 --> 06:46.560]  Uh, someone wrote that, uh, that movie's like, you know, thank God I wasn't standing there ten seconds ago, the movie.
[06:46.860 --> 06:50.760]  Because, like, everything, like, gets blown up or destroyed right behind them as they're, like, driving.
[06:50.980 --> 06:51.280]  Oh, no.
[06:52.060 --> 06:52.900]  Someone wrote.
[06:53.100 --> 06:53.280]  Oh, no.
[06:53.280 --> 06:56.980]  It became, it became an original comment and then became someone wrote.
[06:57.140 --> 07:00.300]  I've also learned that Geoff really likes that joke. He laughed both times.
[07:01.700 --> 07:05.660]  Well, that makes sense. It was your joke. I like you. You're funny.
[07:06.060 --> 07:07.140]  I think you...
[07:07.140 --> 07:13.680]  I mean, I think you are the most entertaining person I've ever met. That's why I work with you.
[07:14.140 --> 07:20.560]  So it stands to reason that Jack, like, poorly ripping you off would still be amusing to me because it's still your comedy.
[07:21.460 --> 07:23.360]  Oh, that's a nice level of consistency.
[07:23.360 --> 07:37.020]  To be clear, Gavin's tweet is the 18th of November of 2009 and episode 39 of the Rooster Teeth podcast is December 9th, 2009.
[07:37.540 --> 07:41.000]  I mean, just mere weeks. Mere weeks.
[07:41.220 --> 07:47.080]  After I mentioned it, Jack texts me saying, I don't think I stole your 2012 joke, question mark.
[07:47.600 --> 07:50.680]  But then afterwards he wrote, but that was 20 years ago, so maybe.
[07:52.400 --> 07:58.180]  I'm completely off Jack's defense. I am stepping away from it entirely.
[07:58.740 --> 08:02.020]  Bold move by the defense to say that was a totally different joke.
[08:02.820 --> 08:03.620]  Yeah, well...
[08:03.620 --> 08:09.120]  To be fair, not a very original joke. I'm sure a bunch of people watched that movie and thought the exact same thing.
[08:09.360 --> 08:15.340]  I'm pretty sure you're the only one. I'm on your side now. Definitely yours. And only yours.
[08:15.560 --> 08:20.220]  Does that ever happen in court where the defense walks over to the prosecution and they just sit next to each other?
[08:20.220 --> 08:26.380]  Listen, I'm a vibes guy. I've just been feeling the vibes of this courtroom and I've been swayed. I've moved through.
[08:26.820 --> 08:31.500]  Information has come out. I came in as a middle lawyer.
[08:32.700 --> 08:33.980]  And I gotta say, it's on your side.
[08:34.080 --> 08:37.240]  This is the whole point of discovery, as they say.
[08:38.040 --> 08:38.440]  Yes.
[08:38.860 --> 08:42.340]  We can find out all the dirty secrets and truths and they can come to light.
[08:42.440 --> 08:46.220]  And then we can find out the reality of the situation, which is that Jack...
[08:47.360 --> 08:49.500]  What year was that again? 2012?
[08:49.500 --> 08:50.140]  2009.
[08:51.760 --> 08:56.520]  That Jack in 2009 is exactly as annoying as Jack in 2024 and still a thief.
[08:59.380 --> 09:06.780]  I like that that closes out a 15 year storyline. It's not bad. It's like the old Halo Overkill.
[09:06.880 --> 09:07.880]  How do you feel about it?
[09:07.980 --> 09:08.420]  How do I feel?
[09:08.660 --> 09:13.480]  Yeah, because you say it like this has been on everyone's collective mind for 15 years.
[09:13.900 --> 09:17.120]  This is the thing that you've been holding internally for that time.
[09:17.120 --> 09:23.100]  Okay, I've been thinking about it for 15 years, but company like public plot wise, it's been about three weeks.
[09:25.040 --> 09:29.120]  But, you know, a good one to close out before the company ends entirely.
[09:29.240 --> 09:33.420]  Before the company closes out. Yeah. How does that? Do you feel like the biggest sense of completion?
[09:34.640 --> 09:37.060]  Um, no. Well, I mean, I think it's funny.
[09:37.320 --> 09:38.040]  It is funny.
[09:38.240 --> 09:41.180]  I wouldn't... I don't care either way, really. Just a dumb tweet.
[09:41.620 --> 09:44.140]  I shouldn't say that Jack's a thief. I'm just making a joke.
[09:44.140 --> 09:46.560]  He kind of said he was.
[09:47.460 --> 09:51.740]  What do you think you are the first person to ever do in your life?
[09:52.680 --> 09:53.740]  Slip on a sushi container.
[09:54.920 --> 10:08.940]  I'm the first person... I'm the first person on earth to sit in a swivel chair and drink a Diet Pepsi with a watch on my right arm in this office.
[10:09.540 --> 10:10.900]  Okay, decent.
[10:10.900 --> 10:14.300]  I guarantee you nobody else has done that in the history of this house.
[10:14.880 --> 10:15.600]  Anybody else?
[10:15.760 --> 10:20.740]  Well, I have one that I have a mystery that made me think of a mystery that I'm dealing with.
[10:21.160 --> 10:27.420]  I am the only person who has lived in the unit that I live in as the first person to move in.
[10:27.720 --> 10:36.400]  And I noticed yesterday on my bathroom wall, there are a bunch of scratch marks on the wall that I definitely didn't cause.
[10:36.460 --> 10:38.540]  Nobody I know would have been there caused.
[10:39.080 --> 10:40.360]  I don't know where they came from.
[10:40.740 --> 10:43.300]  I assume that I was the first to do everything in this space.
[10:43.760 --> 10:45.580]  I don't know why there are scratch marks on my wall.
[10:45.900 --> 10:47.320]  They're very clearly scratch marks.
[10:47.660 --> 10:48.300]  Do you think it was an animal?
[10:48.900 --> 10:57.940]  Maybe, but I don't know how would an animal have gotten up to my unit and then scratched in this specific place.
[10:58.380 --> 10:59.660]  While it was being built, maybe?
[10:59.740 --> 10:59.980]  Maybe.
[11:01.080 --> 11:03.960]  Do you think they've always been there? They're not new, right?
[11:03.960 --> 11:09.780]  Well, that's the thing. I don't know if I just never noticed or if they're new-ish.
[11:09.940 --> 11:11.720]  I don't know how they would be new-ish, though, if they were.
[11:13.840 --> 11:15.840]  So, I'll... yeah, I think Gavin might be onto something.
[11:16.080 --> 11:22.420]  One time during the pandemic, we stayed at a hotel downtown for like a staycation.
[11:22.820 --> 11:25.880]  Kind of, you know, just to like sleep in a different bed and look out a different window.
[11:26.620 --> 11:28.960]  And it was at a place downtown that was kind of nice.
[11:29.020 --> 11:31.160]  We had like a little deck and we could sit out on the deck.
[11:31.160 --> 11:38.340]  And right across from where our hotel was, like on the other side of the street, they were building another high-rise condo kind of thing.
[11:38.860 --> 11:42.880]  And I want to say it was like built about two floors below where we were.
[11:43.040 --> 11:46.000]  So, we were like on the 11th floor. This was like maybe the 9th or the 10th floor.
[11:46.660 --> 11:55.300]  And at night, as soon as the sun would go down and all the workers would leave, hundreds of raccoons would come from God knows where.
[11:55.300 --> 12:03.100]  And they would have the biggest raccoon party on the top of this, you know, in process constructed building.
[12:03.240 --> 12:10.620]  And we spent a weekend just sitting on the deck, just laughing and watching raccoons play raccoon games.
[12:10.740 --> 12:17.780]  And rip shit up and go through the foot trash and eat, you know, like old fried chicken that somebody had thrown in a trash bag.
[12:17.880 --> 12:20.320]  And just like, and just wreak havoc.
[12:20.380 --> 12:22.500]  And then every, and then when they were done, they would leave.
[12:22.820 --> 12:24.380]  And then the next night they would come back out.
[12:24.380 --> 12:28.620]  I bet there was a fucking raccoon party in your apartment as it was being built.
[12:28.740 --> 12:32.400]  I love that. That's a narrative. I'm just going to go with that narrative, even if it isn't true.
[12:32.500 --> 12:33.960]  I like the idea of a raccoon party.
[12:34.240 --> 12:38.380]  I remember I was helping my friend move into a brand new house in England.
[12:38.740 --> 12:41.300]  And he was like giving me the tour and we were moving stuff in.
[12:41.560 --> 12:46.240]  And as a joke, he licked the toilet seat because he was like, ah, it's the only time I could do that.
[12:46.360 --> 12:51.040]  No one's used it yet. And I was like, the builders have probably shat in that thing a bunch.
[12:53.060 --> 12:54.380]  And he always threw up.
[12:54.760 --> 12:54.960]  Yeah.
[12:56.660 --> 12:59.320]  I was, I was thinking about something similar.
[12:59.960 --> 13:04.280]  Actually, right around the time that we all lost our jobs, it would sidetrack.
[13:04.380 --> 13:04.660]  What?
[13:04.800 --> 13:11.340]  But I had begun initial, I had this thought and I had done some initial work around an episode of So All Right.
[13:11.900 --> 13:16.120]  Where I got to thinking about how many people have touched your, something in your house.
[13:16.180 --> 13:17.780]  Like how many people have touched your dining room table?
[13:17.780 --> 13:21.620]  Like physically human people have interacted with it.
[13:21.780 --> 13:23.340]  Like if you, or like your microwave.
[13:23.640 --> 13:29.760]  Think about like every component that was built in the microwave that was touched by a human being.
[13:29.960 --> 13:31.480]  The person who packed it up.
[13:31.760 --> 13:34.460]  The people who did the quality control checks.
[13:34.660 --> 13:39.680]  The people who loaded it onto a truck.
[13:39.920 --> 13:42.260]  And then the people who unloaded it and then put it on a shelf.
[13:42.520 --> 13:44.380]  And then you bring it in your house and then you unpack it.
[13:44.380 --> 13:48.420]  By the time you open a brand new item that nobody's ever used before.
[13:48.740 --> 13:53.100]  Hundreds and hundreds of humans have probably physically interacted with it.
[13:53.620 --> 13:59.200]  And my dining room table is one of those shitty like made from reclaimed pallets table.
[13:59.340 --> 14:01.120]  So it was a pallet before it was a table.
[14:01.380 --> 14:02.840]  So it's probably got even longer life.
[14:03.100 --> 14:03.920]  It had a whole other life.
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.580]  And then if you want to take it back to, like that pallet was a tree that a human cut.
[14:07.740 --> 14:09.220]  And then milled, you know.
[14:09.280 --> 14:13.540]  And even if it's a human running a machine, he's still pushing buttons and manipulating what's happening.
[14:13.540 --> 14:16.620]  And then somebody's still taking it off the thing and loading it up as lumber.
[14:17.000 --> 14:25.640]  And then some, it's, or like my dining room table is an old like Danish table I bought from a, like a used furniture store from the 60s, right?
[14:25.660 --> 14:26.820]  Like a Danish modern table.
[14:27.780 --> 14:30.700]  Mill, how many people have just eaten dinner at that fucking table?
[14:31.060 --> 14:31.280]  You know?
[14:31.320 --> 14:34.360]  God, imagine if before you died, you had to put everything back.
[14:41.440 --> 14:46.540]  Just look at all your stuff and be like, oh no, where's all this shit from technically?
[14:48.440 --> 14:55.840]  It kind of overwhelmed me for a couple of days though, where I just couldn't look at anything in my house and not think about how many hundreds of people had had their grubby hands all over it.
[14:56.260 --> 14:59.700]  Like, I don't even want to think about how many people have touched my sofa before I ever did.
[14:59.700 --> 15:06.820]  Especially if you're thinking about the foam and the, the, the fucking, the fabric and the assemblage of the fabric.
[15:06.940 --> 15:08.680]  Like every, it's mind boggling.
[15:09.200 --> 15:11.240]  How many people's balls do you think have been on it?
[15:12.040 --> 15:12.760]  Oh, tons.
[15:13.940 --> 15:17.240]  Everybody I know that's a dude has had their balls on it, pretty much.
[15:17.260 --> 15:17.380]  Yeah.
[15:17.780 --> 15:20.540]  You know? At least that I know, that I spend any kind of time with.
[15:21.360 --> 15:37.160]  But I was thinking about it because like, 150 years ago or 120 years ago, you would like forge out into the West and then you'd build a house with your, by yourself or with another friend or with your wife or your kid.
[15:37.780 --> 15:41.900]  And then you'd, if you needed something in that house, you'd go cut down a tree and you'd fucking make it.
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.160]  And you could have a house that you were the only person that touched, potentially, you know?
[15:46.160 --> 15:52.120]  Like it'd get complicated if you bought like a piece, like something made out of iron that you got down from the local smith or whatever.
[15:52.260 --> 15:56.920]  But for the most part, you would have been the only person to interact with all of your shit.
[15:57.040 --> 15:59.060]  And boy are we in a different world than that now.
[15:59.500 --> 15:59.660]  Totally.
[15:59.820 --> 16:00.640]  That's crazy to think about.
[16:00.780 --> 16:05.220]  Do you ever drink a glass of water and think how, these molecules, how many people have they been inside before?
[16:06.020 --> 16:06.380]  No.
[16:06.520 --> 16:08.880]  No, I never have, but I'm not going to drink water anymore.
[16:11.160 --> 16:13.200]  Eric said never, WTF.
[16:13.520 --> 16:14.280]  You never thought that?
[16:14.400 --> 16:14.640]  No.
[16:14.640 --> 16:17.960]  I've never, ever thought that, ever.
[16:18.260 --> 16:20.580]  There's a finite amount of water on the planet.
[16:21.100 --> 16:26.400]  Yeah, no, I understand that. I just never thought about it being through a person. It just never occurred to me.
[16:26.680 --> 16:28.400]  Now it has, thanks man, appreciate it.
[16:28.580 --> 16:28.860]  No worries.
[16:31.940 --> 16:38.720]  Anyway, when you're walking around your apartment or your home tonight, just pick one random item and pick it up and then think,
[16:38.720 --> 16:43.880]  7,000 people touched this before I knew it existed, and then wipe it down.
[16:44.540 --> 16:54.780]  Going back to the mystery conversation of, or Gavin's resolution, do you guys have any Easter eggs or things related to this show that have never come out?
[16:55.340 --> 16:56.500]  You're still just sitting on?
[16:57.960 --> 17:01.560]  Aside from notes that I don't understand, I don't think so.
[17:02.820 --> 17:13.900]  I have stuff that was in process that could still be in process. There's a few things here and there that I don't need to wrap up because I'll just carry them on to the next thing, if that makes sense.
[17:15.420 --> 17:20.100]  Gracie said grip strength? That's carrying on. That is not over.
[17:20.640 --> 17:26.100]  Don't, I mean, Geoff, don't even bother. I mean, what's the point? It's fine. Just say okay and let's keep going.
[17:26.500 --> 17:29.040]  Is that the thing that we didn't pre-measure?
[17:29.040 --> 17:30.960]  No, we didn't. We pre-measured.
[17:32.380 --> 17:33.560]  We pre-measured.
[17:34.540 --> 17:36.460]  But you don't want to say the pre.
[17:36.700 --> 17:37.760]  I'm fine saying the pre.
[17:38.240 --> 17:39.820]  Now, if it's going to be a big deal.
[17:40.180 --> 17:43.220]  Now that I've stopped doing it for fucking two months.
[17:43.240 --> 17:46.280]  At this point, you have to just start over. I mean, get real.
[17:46.840 --> 17:47.780]  Get real!
[17:48.260 --> 17:51.460]  Listen, I don't want to go down this road of anger and fighting.
[17:52.200 --> 17:57.400]  There's no, I'm looking at that street and there's no way anyone comes out feeling good about themselves.
[17:57.400 --> 17:58.720]  So we're going to keep walking.
[17:58.880 --> 18:00.900]  I don't think that's true. I think I'm not involved.
[18:01.120 --> 18:01.880]  You're not involved.
[18:02.720 --> 18:03.300]  Decidedly not.
[18:04.900 --> 18:07.680]  But, I have, I had an Easter egg for this show.
[18:08.240 --> 18:09.420]  One of the bigger ones I've done.
[18:09.920 --> 18:10.580]  No one's found.
[18:11.260 --> 18:12.940]  Been sitting on it for like nine months.
[18:13.180 --> 18:13.780]  And I don't know how to go.
[18:13.780 --> 18:16.500]  Oh, is that what you, you were exing the other day?
[18:17.220 --> 18:18.200]  I was exing?
[18:18.420 --> 18:19.040]  The other, what?
[18:19.220 --> 18:20.420]  I saw, I saw, I saw a tweet.
[18:20.560 --> 18:20.920]  Like on Twitter.
[18:20.920 --> 18:22.360]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:22.360 --> 18:24.100]  I saw a tweet from you that somebody had posted.
[18:25.180 --> 18:25.320]  Yeah.
[18:25.320 --> 18:30.420]  So is it like to the level of maybe one of us has monopoly money in our house and we don't know it sort of thing?
[18:30.900 --> 18:32.760]  I would say it's beyond that.
[18:33.800 --> 18:36.260]  I don't know how much I should reveal.
[18:36.520 --> 18:38.220]  I confirmed it's still there.
[18:38.800 --> 18:44.200]  I gave all the instructions to find it in an episode within the past nine months.
[18:45.220 --> 18:46.580]  Is it like a scavenger?
[18:46.700 --> 18:48.540]  Like it's out to the public to find?
[18:48.540 --> 18:59.960]  Well, that's, I was hoping someone would just find it one day because I, I prompted how to find it kind of subtly in a show that we did within the last nine months.
[19:00.300 --> 19:01.740]  And it has yet to be discovered.
[19:02.280 --> 19:03.520]  No traces of it.
[19:03.860 --> 19:05.580]  Within the last nine months, you say?
[19:05.800 --> 19:08.780]  Within the last nine months, to give a little bit of a range.
[19:09.520 --> 19:11.640]  Now, is this an Easter egg for us or for the audience?
[19:12.040 --> 19:14.380]  Uh, I mean, you guys don't know about it.
[19:14.700 --> 19:17.320]  I mean, it could be something that you could discover.
[19:17.320 --> 19:19.860]  Yeah, but you could fill a fucking ocean with what we don't know.
[19:20.060 --> 19:25.120]  I could tell you guys offline if you want, or I could, do I reveal? I don't know what to do.
[19:25.220 --> 19:27.320]  I know, because this is wrapping up as...
[19:28.060 --> 19:29.620]  Does it end when the company ends?
[19:30.240 --> 19:31.800]  Uh, it will still exist.
[19:32.720 --> 19:35.660]  It will just still be there to be found.
[19:35.840 --> 19:37.100]  I think then we just, we just wait.
[19:37.700 --> 19:39.820]  Okay. Should I give like a clue?
[19:40.940 --> 19:43.680]  I mean, it sounds like you just did. It's within the last nine months.
[19:43.860 --> 19:44.740]  I guess, yeah, within nine months.
[19:44.760 --> 19:45.820]  That means it was nine months ago.
[19:45.820 --> 19:47.020]  It's within nine months.
[19:54.420 --> 19:56.860]  If that's what you want to believe, then you can do that.
[19:58.580 --> 19:59.860]  I can love you.
[20:02.460 --> 20:04.380]  I'm not going to confirm or deny that statement.
[20:08.960 --> 20:12.420]  You'll see when it's found. If it is found, people will confirm.
[20:12.960 --> 20:13.780]  If that's right or not.
[20:13.880 --> 20:14.120]  Okay.
[20:15.120 --> 20:16.540]  I do love when people say shit like that.
[20:16.540 --> 20:19.080]  It was like, yeah, I waited for over 20 minutes.
[20:19.200 --> 20:21.700]  And it's like, so 21 minutes or 20 minutes and one second.
[20:25.630 --> 20:29.190]  We should also, we need to pass the torch.
[20:29.330 --> 20:32.310]  My watch has ended on the Nick mask.
[20:32.850 --> 20:34.590]  Who's taking Q2?
[20:35.690 --> 20:37.310]  I think I was Q2.
[20:37.610 --> 20:37.790]  Okay.
[20:38.610 --> 20:41.390]  And the last couple of episodes, did you have an ear out for it?
[20:42.450 --> 20:43.410]  Yeah, I've been listening.
[20:43.990 --> 20:47.190]  I've noticed that a lot of the audience seems to think that he's already worn it.
[20:47.190 --> 20:50.230]  But I didn't pick up on it.
[20:50.390 --> 20:52.250]  He's supposed to declare if he's worn it.
[20:52.590 --> 20:53.470]  So exactly.
[20:53.610 --> 20:55.250]  And we're all up to date on the rules.
[20:55.370 --> 20:56.370]  Always. We know that.
[20:56.570 --> 20:57.050]  Yeah.
[20:57.090 --> 20:59.990]  This is definitely a thing that we remember.
[20:59.990 --> 21:01.810]  And we always take stock of.
[21:02.050 --> 21:06.830]  And that I know Gavin was diligently paying attention to for three straight months.
[21:06.970 --> 21:08.450]  Now I'm clearly also.
[21:08.510 --> 21:13.970]  It means just as much to us as it does to you, the listener at home.
[21:14.230 --> 21:15.470]  A hundred percent.
[21:15.570 --> 21:16.050]  Absolutely.
[21:16.050 --> 21:22.690]  Now, does he have to do this in face or can it go over to the next thing?
[21:23.690 --> 21:24.850]  I think it has to.
[21:24.950 --> 21:25.550]  I think it's unfair.
[21:25.550 --> 21:27.310]  I think it can roll into the next thing.
[21:27.390 --> 21:28.850]  I think it rolls into the next thing.
[21:29.270 --> 21:29.730]  It's gonna roll.
[21:30.170 --> 21:30.330]  Yeah.
[21:32.530 --> 21:34.390]  That sounds like face jam, Nick.
[21:38.570 --> 21:41.730]  Face jam Nick occurs a couple of octaves above normal.
[21:41.750 --> 21:42.190]  He does.
[21:42.370 --> 21:43.410]  You can ask Gracie.
[21:43.510 --> 21:43.990]  Gracie knows.
[21:43.990 --> 21:49.090]  When Nick is in face jam mode, the pitch is like higher.
[21:49.450 --> 21:49.950]  It's very.
[21:50.210 --> 21:52.130]  But also, we did face jam earlier today.
[21:52.370 --> 21:53.430]  So that might be.
[21:54.090 --> 21:55.290]  He's having trouble coming down.
[21:55.430 --> 21:57.150]  Is he in the mask right now?
[21:59.130 --> 22:00.590]  Wait, are you wasting a guess?
[22:00.870 --> 22:02.250]  No, no, you're not.
[22:02.350 --> 22:05.050]  Are you wasting a guess?
[22:05.190 --> 22:06.630]  First of all, I don't think.
[22:06.790 --> 22:10.290]  I think if we all fired our bullets, we would have more bullets.
[22:10.390 --> 22:11.930]  And there are shows left this face.
[22:11.930 --> 22:13.050]  I don't think.
[22:13.730 --> 22:14.810]  I think that would be a problem for you.
[22:14.810 --> 22:17.830]  I wouldn't fire the bullet in response to do you want to waste a guess.
[22:20.830 --> 22:23.050]  Do you want to be wrong today or next week?
[22:23.270 --> 22:23.650]  Today?
[22:23.870 --> 22:24.350]  Okay, cool.
[22:25.630 --> 22:27.130]  Does Eric have different modes?
[22:27.230 --> 22:29.450]  Does Gracie have different modes between the two shows?
[22:29.970 --> 22:31.250]  Oh, I think.
[22:31.370 --> 22:33.650]  I don't know if Gracie will admit that she does, but she does.
[22:33.670 --> 22:34.070]  No, I do.
[22:34.370 --> 22:34.650]  I do.
[22:34.890 --> 22:35.070]  Yeah.
[22:35.170 --> 22:37.550]  Are you more of a freak or less of a freak on this one?
[22:37.690 --> 22:37.850]  More.
[22:38.630 --> 22:39.410]  You're less.
[22:39.910 --> 22:40.310]  Less.
[22:40.310 --> 22:41.690]  I'm way less.
[22:41.930 --> 22:43.330]  Even with that picture you took?
[22:44.070 --> 22:44.390]  Yeah.
[22:44.710 --> 22:47.330]  So how come you're half-assing it over here, Gracie?
[22:48.430 --> 22:51.330]  Sounds like you give it 110% over to those face-jam fuckers.
[22:51.390 --> 22:52.830]  It's a different beast over there.
[22:53.310 --> 22:56.050]  She doesn't have to do any of the heavy lifting here.
[22:56.190 --> 22:59.150]  There's plenty between the three of you, so it's fine.
[23:00.010 --> 23:02.230]  There's a talent deficit on the other side.
[23:02.330 --> 23:02.670]  I get it.
[23:02.710 --> 23:04.590]  It's a lot about when the food gets involved.
[23:04.790 --> 23:08.650]  Because I take charge in that realm, and that's what really gets me out of my cage.
[23:08.650 --> 23:12.970]  The food gets her and Nick going in a way that is inhuman.
[23:13.370 --> 23:21.970]  Somebody described face-jam as four fathers that have a daughter that they're not related to that sleeps in a human dog bed.
[23:22.390 --> 23:27.210]  And that really is the show, and we eat pizza.
[23:27.570 --> 23:28.390]  That's kind of it.
[23:28.730 --> 23:29.570]  That's just kind of it.
[23:30.670 --> 23:42.650]  Speaking of eating stuff, apparently it has been brought to my attention over and over and over again in all forms of social media and email
[23:43.210 --> 23:50.430]  that the banana thing we invented, or that I invented, exists in many, many forms and has for a very long time.
[23:50.650 --> 23:52.210]  I had no idea.
[23:52.650 --> 23:57.350]  There's no point in trying to go further down that road because I can buy 20 different ones on Amazon.
[23:57.930 --> 24:00.830]  But you also don't have to let me know about it anymore.
[24:00.950 --> 24:02.210]  I got the message.
[24:02.490 --> 24:05.190]  I really, 100% got the message.
[24:05.290 --> 24:07.430]  We can still do our own version.
[24:07.710 --> 24:12.290]  Not versions of the product, but we can still fill our bananas and present them to each other with stuff.
[24:13.050 --> 24:14.870]  Yes, we can, and I think that's still a good idea.
[24:15.150 --> 24:17.190]  I just don't think we need to be in a rush to do it.
[24:17.370 --> 24:19.170]  Yeah, no, the market is already set.
[24:19.730 --> 24:20.450]  We can take our time.
[24:21.110 --> 24:22.710]  I'm not going to try to sell a product doing it.
[24:22.710 --> 24:29.630]  But we can definitely make our own versions and add it to the rich pastiche of f***face culinary.
[24:30.510 --> 24:37.630]  Because I still want to see if a Tums-powdered, Pepto-filled banana is suitable for Gracie.
[24:39.330 --> 24:39.850]  No.
[24:40.950 --> 24:42.090]  The answer is no.
[24:42.830 --> 24:43.530]  I think it will be.
[24:44.690 --> 24:46.190]  Well, there's only one way to find out.
[24:47.330 --> 24:49.130]  What? So you're going to do it?
[24:49.290 --> 24:50.670]  Yeah, this is insane.
[24:53.510 --> 24:55.810]  Well, then if she keeps it down, it worked, right?
[24:56.970 --> 24:57.830]  But I don't... yeah.
[24:58.150 --> 24:59.730]  Something tells me I'm not going to keep it down.
[25:01.290 --> 25:03.010]  I respect the willingness to try.
[25:03.990 --> 25:07.330]  Andrew and I almost filmed a new show this week, but then we didn't.
[25:07.410 --> 25:07.910]  Yeah, I guess so.
[25:07.910 --> 25:08.270]  Oh, what happened?
[25:09.350 --> 25:10.870]  I just felt terrible yesterday.
[25:11.090 --> 25:13.450]  I felt... I sounded worse yesterday than I do today.
[25:13.850 --> 25:14.190]  Wow.
[25:14.530 --> 25:15.430]  But we're close.
[25:15.570 --> 25:15.930]  We're close.
[25:16.030 --> 25:16.890]  We got the components.
[25:17.110 --> 25:17.990]  We're very excited now.
[25:18.190 --> 25:18.950]  Very excited.
[25:18.950 --> 25:22.030]  What are you actually doing that keeps triggering your gag reflex?
[25:22.970 --> 25:25.690]  Vomiting acid. I went over this. That was the whole beginning of the show.
[25:26.630 --> 25:28.470]  No, but I'm saying, what causes that?
[25:28.710 --> 25:29.950]  Oh, I go...
[25:30.810 --> 25:33.150]  Like I'm trying to cough up phlegm.
[25:33.370 --> 25:36.010]  And then I push it a little too hard.
[25:36.250 --> 25:36.410]  Oh.
[25:37.870 --> 25:38.330]  Okay.
[25:38.830 --> 25:41.010]  And then I cross a point of no return.
[25:41.490 --> 25:41.850]  Fuck.
[25:44.350 --> 25:45.530]  Have you never done that?
[25:46.110 --> 25:46.590]  Oh, yeah.
[25:47.590 --> 25:48.510]  Well, here we go.
[25:48.510 --> 25:50.050]  You know exactly what I'm talking about.
[25:50.230 --> 25:53.630]  You just made it sound like you kept trying something and then you gagged.
[25:54.210 --> 25:56.310]  Well, I was trying to cough phlegm up.
[25:56.630 --> 26:00.090]  And then I, you know, I was successful.
[26:00.590 --> 26:01.270]  And some.
[26:02.010 --> 26:02.450]  Unfortunately.
[26:03.230 --> 26:03.590]  Bad play.
[26:03.990 --> 26:06.290]  But listen, I learned my lesson two times.
[26:06.890 --> 26:07.790]  Not gonna happen a third.
[26:08.590 --> 26:09.690]  Ain't gonna happen a third.
[26:09.910 --> 26:10.510]  Fool me twice.
[26:12.770 --> 26:13.710]  Can't fool a fooler.
[26:13.730 --> 26:17.630]  I got some beef with Warner Brothers.
[26:17.630 --> 26:18.930]  I'm mad at Warner Brothers.
[26:20.170 --> 26:21.370]  I'm upset with them.
[26:22.030 --> 26:23.150]  They've done me.
[26:23.230 --> 26:25.710]  First of all, we don't have jobs.
[26:25.930 --> 26:26.870]  That was unfortunate.
[26:27.310 --> 26:29.810]  Second of all, I'm kind of okay with it.
[26:31.250 --> 26:33.150]  Even more offensive.
[26:34.070 --> 26:35.270]  Those sons of bitches.
[26:36.210 --> 26:41.130]  They're filming The Last of Us Season 2 where I live for six weeks.
[26:42.190 --> 26:46.830]  They're filming it in the downtown core, which is a street where I live.
[26:48.490 --> 26:54.070]  And my problem with this is for six weeks, it's gonna be shut down.
[26:54.270 --> 26:57.230]  And the best donut shop in the city is on that street.
[26:57.630 --> 26:59.210]  No donuts for six weeks.
[26:59.270 --> 27:00.790]  All because of The Last of Us 2.
[27:00.990 --> 27:02.350]  I'm so annoyed.
[27:02.890 --> 27:07.690]  I'm so fucking mad at these stupid clickers and these fireflies.
[27:08.610 --> 27:11.650]  If you get a job as background, though, can you just keep going to the donut shop?
[27:12.310 --> 27:13.870]  No, because it's closed.
[27:14.130 --> 27:14.570]  They're just not.
[27:14.770 --> 27:15.310]  Close to crew?
[27:15.310 --> 27:22.550]  All the businesses are shutting down and they're being compensated that week.
[27:22.670 --> 27:24.130]  So here's what's gonna happen.
[27:24.150 --> 27:24.710]  Those weeks.
[27:25.230 --> 27:27.810]  That business, that donut shop, when does this take place?
[27:28.630 --> 27:29.350]  Like next week.
[27:29.570 --> 27:30.670]  Okay, you've got time.
[27:31.830 --> 27:33.870]  Do they know you by face at the donut shop?
[27:34.470 --> 27:34.830]  No.
[27:35.370 --> 27:36.610]  But you go there a lot, right?
[27:36.850 --> 27:38.190]  Yeah, I go there sometimes.
[27:38.190 --> 27:46.210]  And I know you're personable in person because you turned the entire Canadian bagel industry upside down.
[27:47.650 --> 27:51.110]  I mean, when you have a product like the Irregulation Bagel, it's hard not to.
[27:51.290 --> 27:56.390]  Exactly. And so the reason I bring that up is that people know of you now in that community, I'm sure.
[27:56.750 --> 27:57.550]  So here's what you do.
[27:57.590 --> 28:00.950]  You go into your donut shop and you go, listen, I heard you guys are getting a week off.
[28:02.250 --> 28:03.130]  Full pay, right?
[28:03.370 --> 28:05.890]  What's better than getting a week off full pay?
[28:05.890 --> 28:15.730]  How about getting full pay but also working about half as hard as normal running an illegal fucking fly-by-night donut shop at the back of the store?
[28:16.030 --> 28:17.690]  They don't have to know what's going on.
[28:17.850 --> 28:20.070]  We'll keep the curtains closed.
[28:20.410 --> 28:22.870]  Keep the shutters drawn, right?
[28:23.590 --> 28:26.310]  And you could even become a distributor for them.
[28:26.470 --> 28:29.810]  They could compile a list of their best customers.
[28:30.290 --> 28:34.410]  And then you could do secret orders by night and you could be a runner for them.
[28:34.410 --> 28:39.170]  And you could send off, you could be the guy that delivers the donuts and then you could always take a little bit just for you.
[28:39.370 --> 28:41.690]  It could be a wildly profitable for everybody involved.
[28:42.670 --> 28:47.350]  I love the idea of seeing an episode like Ellie in the foreground searching stuff.
[28:47.410 --> 28:50.490]  You just see Andrew running through the background out of focus with a bag of donuts.
[28:53.710 --> 28:55.030]  That zombie's wearing shorts.
[28:58.610 --> 29:03.470]  I definitely want to steal something from that set that I don't know when or how.
[29:03.470 --> 29:06.670]  Probably would just end up being a poster, if anything.
[29:07.670 --> 29:13.170]  It's unfortunate with The Last of Us, post-apocalypse, not exactly a lot being added.
[29:13.350 --> 29:15.050]  It's more removed, I would assume.
[29:17.710 --> 29:23.830]  It's gonna be weird to watch The Last of Us season 2 be actively angry at certain scenes.
[29:24.010 --> 29:26.830]  Being like, they shut me down for this.
[29:27.190 --> 29:28.330]  This one sequence.
[29:28.650 --> 29:31.150]  How many days do you get a donut from there?
[29:31.830 --> 29:34.350]  Not often, but maybe once a month.
[29:34.790 --> 29:36.630]  So you're gonna miss out on one donut.
[29:37.290 --> 29:39.670]  You're gonna miss out on 1.5 donuts.
[29:40.270 --> 29:46.170]  There might be a time in which I really want a donut in that stretch, and I'm not gonna be able to get it.
[29:46.350 --> 29:51.550]  Well, it sounds like you're not willing to go down there and do the hard work to talk to the owners to figure out how to sell donuts.
[29:51.550 --> 29:55.290]  No, I'm not willing to go down there and start an illegal donut ring. You're right.
[29:55.530 --> 29:57.010]  You called me on it, you're right.
[29:57.010 --> 30:01.230]  You would've made so much fucking money in six weeks, and you would've been the hero of your entire community,
[30:01.350 --> 30:05.950]  because you're not the only little boy in a room somewhere in Vancouver Island right now,
[30:06.230 --> 30:08.330]  lamenting the fact that donuts are going away for six weeks.
[30:08.450 --> 30:11.490]  There's hundreds, if not thousands of you in your community that you could be servicing.
[30:11.830 --> 30:14.630]  But irrespective of that, just go buy a dozen donuts and freeze them.
[30:15.390 --> 30:18.390]  I guess, but I don't know. I like them fresh. I don't know.
[30:18.790 --> 30:20.550]  I don't think it's the same.
[30:20.570 --> 30:22.790]  There's nothing better than a fresh donut. You're 100% right.
[30:22.790 --> 30:29.570]  Have you thought about just getting the ingredients from them early, and then making them at your house later?
[30:30.130 --> 30:33.530]  I can't make donuts. I tried once. It was a disaster.
[30:33.630 --> 30:35.390]  So you just need a fryer? How do you make one?
[30:36.170 --> 30:37.630]  Yeah, you get an oil in a pot.
[30:37.790 --> 30:38.890]  What if you did it with your Keurig?
[30:39.650 --> 30:42.910]  You put the oil in the back of your Keurig and heat it up.
[30:44.370 --> 30:47.270]  It just gets infused with molten oil.
[30:49.530 --> 30:53.470]  Many years ago, I bought the Carmela Soprano cookbook.
[30:53.670 --> 30:57.470]  And one of the recipes in that cookbook was donuts.
[30:57.790 --> 31:00.470]  It's the only recipe I tried to make out of that cookbook.
[31:00.870 --> 31:02.550]  And it did not go well.
[31:05.090 --> 31:05.990]  Great book!
[31:06.570 --> 31:09.050]  There's a lot of lore in it if you're a Sopranos fan.
[31:09.150 --> 31:10.170]  Worth exploring.
[31:11.050 --> 31:12.710]  But you can't learn the Sopranos universe.
[31:13.370 --> 31:14.730]  You didn't learn anything from it though?
[31:14.730 --> 31:17.930]  You didn't learn anything not to do for the next time you want to make donuts?
[31:19.190 --> 31:20.910]  I learned not to do it again.
[31:22.010 --> 31:23.310]  What went wrong with it?
[31:23.410 --> 31:23.930]  That I learned.
[31:25.450 --> 31:27.310]  They were kind of hard.
[31:27.510 --> 31:29.010]  They weren't all that fluffy.
[31:29.530 --> 31:31.070]  God, I'd love to watch you make donuts.
[31:31.310 --> 31:31.970]  I think you'd be great.
[31:33.890 --> 31:34.810]  I'm not.
[31:35.450 --> 31:36.290]  We could Twitch that.
[31:38.310 --> 31:39.550]  A donut cam?
[31:39.970 --> 31:40.190]  Yeah.
[31:40.930 --> 31:42.810]  Andrew in the kitchen, making donuts.
[31:42.810 --> 31:45.910]  Do you typically go for a filled donut or a ring donut?
[31:46.670 --> 31:48.250]  I'm not a fan of the filled donut.
[31:48.350 --> 31:48.950]  I like the ring.
[31:49.450 --> 31:51.390]  Hey, what's everybody's favorite donut?
[31:53.410 --> 31:56.750]  I like a classic plain ring with chocolate on top.
[31:56.870 --> 31:57.530]  I think that's a classic.
[31:57.790 --> 32:01.490]  And I don't mind the occasional sort of raspberry jam one filled.
[32:04.190 --> 32:05.230]  I think...
[32:06.270 --> 32:07.910]  Maybe like honey glaze?
[32:09.250 --> 32:10.290]  Honey glaze?
[32:10.290 --> 32:13.890]  I just stay away from all white goo on the inside of donuts.
[32:16.250 --> 32:18.910]  Are there foods that you go all in for the white goo?
[32:19.130 --> 32:19.950]  That's not a donut.
[32:21.890 --> 32:22.850]  Apple fritter!
[32:24.930 --> 32:25.550]  Not a donut.
[32:26.810 --> 32:27.590]  Absolute donut.
[32:28.010 --> 32:28.630]  Total donut.
[32:29.030 --> 32:29.510]  Yeah, it's a donut.
[32:29.690 --> 32:32.250]  Gracie says strawberry glaze, Nick says maple.
[32:32.790 --> 32:34.090]  You know what my favorite donut is?
[32:34.630 --> 32:37.350]  Just a fucking glazed donut.
[32:37.610 --> 32:38.770]  Just a normal ass donut.
[32:39.190 --> 32:40.150]  They glide down.
[32:40.290 --> 32:43.510]  You can just stuff most of it in your mouth and they become nothing.
[32:43.630 --> 32:43.990]  It's great.
[32:44.550 --> 32:46.930]  I like every donut y'all have posted here.
[32:47.030 --> 32:48.090]  And I would eat every one of them.
[32:48.230 --> 32:51.030]  But when I think donut, I just want to eat a bog standard donut.
[32:51.370 --> 32:55.250]  There's something about you, Geoff, that that tracks with so hard for me.
[32:55.590 --> 32:57.230]  Like you are...
[32:57.230 --> 32:59.190]  If I had to guess, I would be like...
[32:59.190 --> 33:02.230]  That guy doesn't want anything going on except glaze it.
[33:02.270 --> 33:05.130]  And let me just fucking tamp these down my throat as fast as I can.
[33:05.290 --> 33:06.810]  So you're not a voodoo fan?
[33:06.810 --> 33:08.230]  Or a gordos?
[33:08.470 --> 33:10.250]  No, I like them just fine.
[33:10.510 --> 33:12.670]  Every once in a while on a Sunday we'll get voodoo.
[33:12.930 --> 33:14.530]  And you get like the sampler pack and they're great.
[33:15.550 --> 33:16.030]  But...
[33:16.770 --> 33:18.010]  They're a fun distraction.
[33:18.550 --> 33:20.990]  But I'd be just as happy eating a regular donut.
[33:21.170 --> 33:24.630]  Like if you brought me 12 Krispy Kremes or 12 voodoo donuts.
[33:24.790 --> 33:27.270]  I'm not enjoying the voodoo more than the Krispy Kremes.
[33:27.690 --> 33:28.270]  That makes sense.
[33:28.630 --> 33:30.550]  Just Geoff sitting in his little booth.
[33:30.670 --> 33:33.030]  He's got his black coffee with nothing in it.
[33:33.090 --> 33:34.870]  His donut with a basic glaze.
[33:34.870 --> 33:37.150]  You're goddamn right.
[33:37.610 --> 33:39.270]  70's beat cop style.
[33:39.530 --> 33:43.030]  Just sitting there enjoying the most basic thing.
[33:43.470 --> 33:44.610]  That totally makes sense.
[33:44.870 --> 33:47.830]  I think Geoff's becoming more of a bog standard guy as he ages.
[33:48.450 --> 33:49.650]  Oh yeah, could be.
[33:50.230 --> 33:52.530]  I think you just like...
[33:52.530 --> 33:55.650]  At some point who you are gonna be is cemented.
[33:55.770 --> 34:01.230]  And who you are is probably some grown up version of what you thought grown ups were when you were a kid.
[34:01.610 --> 34:04.570]  And so I think Eric's nailed it with the 70's beat cop.
[34:04.570 --> 34:07.690]  Because I grew up as a kid in the 70's and the early mid 80's.
[34:07.990 --> 34:13.990]  And so all the grown ups that I experienced through film and television in my life were kind of like that.
[34:14.250 --> 34:21.430]  Just like dudes with mustaches who drank black coffee out of a foam cup and ate regular donuts.
[34:21.850 --> 34:22.390]  You know what I mean?
[34:22.730 --> 34:25.910]  And didn't bother with ketchup or mustard on stuff.
[34:26.250 --> 34:27.610]  And that's who I'm turning into.
[34:27.850 --> 34:31.870]  And so I think I'm just a product of the Rockford Files.
[34:31.990 --> 34:33.010]  Maybe you should have been a cop.
[34:33.010 --> 34:35.090]  Maybe that's why you like Twin Peaks so much.
[34:37.190 --> 34:38.270]  Geoff is a cop.
[34:39.510 --> 34:44.610]  Dude, I've been thinking about doing a full fucking Twin Peaks watch through again.
[34:44.690 --> 34:45.950]  Oh, I should give you your blu-rays back then.
[34:46.030 --> 34:47.890]  Because you said you would never watch it ever again.
[34:48.630 --> 34:50.270]  I know. I know I said that.
[34:50.750 --> 34:52.190]  And I thought it. I meant it.
[34:52.270 --> 34:53.330]  But it's been...
[34:53.330 --> 34:55.350]  I need to go back and finish season 3.
[34:55.850 --> 34:57.750]  And if I'm gonna finish season 3, I might as well watch season 1.
[34:58.370 --> 35:00.010]  I'll give you your discs back.
[35:00.010 --> 35:01.730]  No, don't give them to me yet.
[35:01.970 --> 35:03.650]  Okay. I might get distracted.
[35:04.230 --> 35:06.270]  Can I jog something back for a second?
[35:06.710 --> 35:09.690]  You were saying you would love to watch Andrew make donuts.
[35:10.010 --> 35:12.170]  Set up a Twitch and then Andrew's making the donuts or whatever.
[35:12.390 --> 35:16.870]  We couldn't even get this guy to film his hands playing this game with sticks.
[35:17.210 --> 35:18.990]  We're not gonna get... what are you talking about?
[35:19.770 --> 35:20.190]  What's this?
[35:21.110 --> 35:22.970]  I don't know. I'm thinking maybe...
[35:22.970 --> 35:23.750]  You're gonna get him making donuts?
[35:24.270 --> 35:28.050]  Maybe the new thing could be Andrew turning over a new leaf with hand cam.
[35:29.350 --> 35:30.110]  Donut cam.
[35:30.370 --> 35:32.710]  2024, new leaf, new cams.
[35:32.810 --> 35:38.150]  I just think a GoPro on your chest would lead to such immense content.
[35:38.930 --> 35:40.110]  Just throughout your life.
[35:40.330 --> 35:40.410]  Donut cam.
[35:41.770 --> 35:42.690]  I agree.
[35:42.970 --> 35:45.190]  Thumb cam, donut cam, sushi cam.
[35:47.090 --> 35:48.250]  Sushi cam is dangerous.
[35:48.470 --> 35:49.510]  I don't know if we can do sushi cam.
[35:50.230 --> 35:51.890]  We gotta be careful with sushi cam.
[35:52.710 --> 35:54.430]  I have another thing.
[35:55.270 --> 35:55.790]  That...
[35:55.790 --> 35:58.730]  Talking about Easter eggs and secrets.
[35:59.430 --> 36:01.210]  Kind of a big one.
[36:01.310 --> 36:02.150]  Kind of a big one.
[36:02.350 --> 36:03.690]  I've been sitting on it a little bit.
[36:04.430 --> 36:05.110]  Tiny little bit.
[36:06.690 --> 36:09.310]  As you all may know, the company is in fact closing.
[36:13.590 --> 36:14.030]  And...
[36:14.030 --> 36:16.470]  Really, Gracie, I'm sorry that you had to look this way.
[36:16.910 --> 36:17.790]  But it is.
[36:19.290 --> 36:19.730]  And...
[36:19.730 --> 36:21.310]  I decided...
[36:21.310 --> 36:23.910]  I'm gonna do something about this.
[36:23.910 --> 36:26.190]  I'm gonna bring us back.
[36:26.610 --> 36:28.010]  That's what I'm gonna do.
[36:28.410 --> 36:30.050]  So if you're listening to this...
[36:30.850 --> 36:31.890]  It is...
[36:32.750 --> 36:33.390]  Wednesday...
[36:33.910 --> 36:35.270]  April 24th?
[36:35.270 --> 36:37.590]  When does this come out?
[36:38.370 --> 36:41.890]  Wednesday, April 24th.
[36:41.910 --> 36:44.110]  I am saving the company.
[36:44.630 --> 36:46.710]  I am invading the store.
[36:47.070 --> 36:47.510]  They're coming.
[36:47.730 --> 36:49.450]  I made a deal with the Chinese government.
[36:49.830 --> 36:50.750]  We got it exported.
[36:50.750 --> 36:52.790]  We got sticks coming.
[36:53.070 --> 36:55.870]  The last drop in the RT store.
[36:56.210 --> 36:57.270]  The underpant line.
[36:57.630 --> 36:58.570]  To save the company.
[36:59.030 --> 37:00.290]  You can get your thumbsticks.
[37:00.690 --> 37:02.590]  Look at how fancy those thumbsticks are.
[37:02.950 --> 37:04.550]  They got two sets of them.
[37:04.890 --> 37:07.010]  You can get a clog tube.
[37:07.450 --> 37:09.330]  It is coming to the market.
[37:09.890 --> 37:11.390]  Look at how beautiful it is.
[37:11.670 --> 37:12.450]  It is there.
[37:12.810 --> 37:13.490]  It is sideways.
[37:13.910 --> 37:16.470]  It makes noise. It's a grown tube. It's a plunger.
[37:16.970 --> 37:18.350]  And last but not least...
[37:18.350 --> 37:19.710]  We're going to need three products.
[37:20.050 --> 37:22.010]  We're going to save this god damn company.
[37:22.210 --> 37:24.430]  That I'm putting on my back here.
[37:24.570 --> 37:25.850]  We got...
[37:25.850 --> 37:27.950]  The underpant bobble head.
[37:28.310 --> 37:30.450]  Of me wearing a face.
[37:30.670 --> 37:31.970]  Of my face.
[37:33.410 --> 37:34.010]  Available...
[37:34.010 --> 37:35.070]  10am central.
[37:35.430 --> 37:37.030]  The last merch drop.
[37:37.890 --> 37:39.550]  I'm going to not save this company.
[37:39.650 --> 37:41.130]  But I'm going to god damn try.
[37:41.390 --> 37:42.790]  Are you fucking serious?
[37:42.970 --> 37:44.350]  This is coming out when?
[37:45.270 --> 37:45.870]  April 24th.
[37:45.870 --> 37:47.550]  April 24th.
[37:47.650 --> 37:49.190]  All of those releasing 10am.
[37:49.470 --> 37:50.950]  I'm invading the store.
[37:51.430 --> 37:53.370]  There's going to be banners of me all over the place.
[37:53.930 --> 37:54.590]  This is my shit.
[37:55.210 --> 37:56.270]  I'm bringing this company back.
[37:56.610 --> 37:58.190]  Andrew is saving the company.
[37:58.610 --> 38:00.630]  But not saving it. It's dead.
[38:00.790 --> 38:01.770]  But I'm trying.
[38:02.970 --> 38:03.830]  I'm trying.
[38:04.450 --> 38:07.070]  Someone should let Warner know I guess.
[38:07.210 --> 38:08.570]  That the company is about to be saved.
[38:09.650 --> 38:09.850]  Yeah.
[38:09.850 --> 38:10.810]  They should.
[38:12.110 --> 38:14.350]  I will tell them when they get here next week.
[38:14.430 --> 38:15.130]  I'll let them know.
[38:15.690 --> 38:16.970]  I'll inform them.
[38:17.970 --> 38:20.570]  I think this is probably the easiest way to do it.
[38:20.730 --> 38:23.630]  Look at these fucking sticks.
[38:24.050 --> 38:25.290]  The precision.
[38:26.030 --> 38:26.530]  Precision.
[38:27.170 --> 38:30.870]  So we are very limited on the number of sticks.
[38:31.310 --> 38:32.050]  That we're selling.
[38:32.330 --> 38:33.150]  Very limited.
[38:33.390 --> 38:35.850]  Because it was insane to get them made.
[38:36.830 --> 38:37.410]  But...
[38:37.410 --> 38:39.830]  Hopefully there's enough clog tubes for everyone.
[38:40.170 --> 38:40.730]  How limited are the sticks?
[38:40.770 --> 38:41.610]  There's not going to be.
[38:43.050 --> 38:44.390]  It's a very low number.
[38:44.630 --> 38:47.230]  Can we just say what the low number is?
[38:47.670 --> 38:49.370]  I don't remember offhand.
[38:49.530 --> 38:51.090]  But it was substantially lower.
[38:51.550 --> 38:53.850]  And it's one of the most collectible items.
[38:54.070 --> 38:54.650]  That we've ever made.
[38:54.730 --> 38:55.710]  That's terrible.
[38:56.850 --> 38:59.050]  What are they going to do?
[38:59.090 --> 39:00.310]  Complain until we shut down?
[39:00.370 --> 39:01.110]  We're done, Gavin.
[39:01.370 --> 39:02.070]  This is it.
[39:02.070 --> 39:04.710]  This is Andrew's last game.
[39:05.450 --> 39:06.050]  This is it.
[39:07.590 --> 39:08.430]  This is all of it.
[39:08.610 --> 39:09.110]  It's done.
[39:10.130 --> 39:11.970]  We'll see how it goes.
[39:12.710 --> 39:14.310]  Everyone will be so mad.
[39:15.490 --> 39:16.590]  It is heartbreaking.
[39:16.770 --> 39:17.470]  A little heartbreaking.
[39:17.830 --> 39:20.290]  To see the stuff that we had cooking.
[39:21.210 --> 39:21.610]  Oh yeah.
[39:22.390 --> 39:24.110]  I'm just talking with merch stuff.
[39:24.230 --> 39:25.690]  Because obviously we're continuing.
[39:26.090 --> 39:27.250]  The company may be ending.
[39:27.650 --> 39:29.870]  But the podcast will soar to the heights.
[39:29.870 --> 39:32.090]  Of the most successful Falcons.
[39:33.030 --> 39:35.010]  But the merch is going to take a hit.
[39:35.150 --> 39:35.570]  In the interim.
[39:35.710 --> 39:37.790]  We're not going to be able to invent clog tubes and shit.
[39:38.770 --> 39:39.750]  Immediately, probably.
[39:40.730 --> 39:43.590]  But Tony in eCom.
[39:44.130 --> 39:45.850]  He put together just a graphic.
[39:46.010 --> 39:47.510]  That showed everything we made.
[39:47.590 --> 39:49.250]  All the weird shit we made on ****face.
[39:49.710 --> 39:50.830]  Throughout the course of the podcast.
[39:51.010 --> 39:52.910]  And it's so wild to see all the dumb.
[39:53.290 --> 39:53.690]  Wacky.
[39:54.450 --> 39:54.850]  Goofy.
[39:55.770 --> 39:56.170]  Ridiculous.
[39:57.210 --> 39:58.370]  Broken shit we made.
[39:58.730 --> 39:59.650]  We should post that publicly.
[39:59.770 --> 40:00.910]  Because that is an insane.
[40:02.130 --> 40:02.850]  Mood board.
[40:03.090 --> 40:04.710]  If you asked me at the beginning.
[40:05.070 --> 40:07.850]  To even list what's on there.
[40:07.890 --> 40:09.710]  I wouldn't have a clue what half of it is.
[40:09.750 --> 40:10.990]  Or how we came to sell it.
[40:11.490 --> 40:13.510]  You'd never be able to know how we got there.
[40:14.730 --> 40:15.390]  It's crazy.
[40:15.890 --> 40:17.530]  We'll be sure to post it on social at some point.
[40:18.970 --> 40:20.230]  I'm glad this stuff is coming out.
[40:20.830 --> 40:21.610]  It is coming out.
[40:21.650 --> 40:23.350]  It's a bummer about the super limited numbers.
[40:23.350 --> 40:25.230]  But the fact that it's coming out at all.
[40:25.410 --> 40:27.050]  I thought the store was done.
[40:27.190 --> 40:28.650]  I thought they had closed up shop.
[40:29.290 --> 40:30.450]  All the items are gone from it.
[40:30.510 --> 40:31.910]  So the fact that there's going to be one last drop.
[40:32.090 --> 40:33.870]  Is a huge surprise to me.
[40:34.550 --> 40:35.670]  Last pant drop.
[40:36.950 --> 40:38.910]  You know what would make this more fair?
[40:39.910 --> 40:40.210]  What?
[40:40.310 --> 40:41.430]  Make it a literal drop.
[40:41.550 --> 40:43.150]  Make it a dead drop.
[40:44.030 --> 40:44.870]  What do you mean?
[40:45.150 --> 40:45.950]  Bury it somewhere.
[40:48.550 --> 40:49.750]  It's not that limited.
[40:49.750 --> 40:50.650]  More business.
[40:51.310 --> 40:53.570]  We should normalize dead drops.
[40:54.070 --> 40:55.250]  Buying stuff online.
[40:56.050 --> 40:57.310]  Telling people where to dig.
[40:57.530 --> 40:59.290]  Dig up the money. Put the thing in the hole.
[40:59.630 --> 40:59.870]  Bury it again.
[41:00.010 --> 41:00.730]  I'm all for this.
[41:02.490 --> 41:03.670]  I support this fully.
[41:03.930 --> 41:06.730]  I've always wanted to do a thing where we bury something.
[41:07.030 --> 41:08.110]  And someone has to find it.
[41:08.870 --> 41:10.090]  I like this idea a lot.
[41:10.170 --> 41:12.610]  I don't know how you'd leave money in.
[41:12.910 --> 41:14.530]  And not have the person just walk off with it.
[41:14.950 --> 41:16.810]  Maybe a slight threat.
[41:16.810 --> 41:18.350]  Like I'm watching you sort of thing.
[41:20.150 --> 41:20.930]  Could be.
[41:21.150 --> 41:24.150]  For most humans I would think it would be a pretty big concern.
[41:24.390 --> 41:25.830]  But for regulation listeners
[41:25.830 --> 41:26.950]  and comment leavers
[41:26.950 --> 41:29.270]  they're top tier humans.
[41:29.610 --> 41:30.190]  You know what I mean?
[41:30.910 --> 41:32.770]  They're the cream of the crop.
[41:32.930 --> 41:34.010]  They're not going to do anything
[41:36.070 --> 41:37.030]  non-regulation
[41:37.030 --> 41:38.570]  in a situation like this.
[41:38.770 --> 41:39.190]  That's fair.
[41:40.210 --> 41:40.890]  I would agree with that.
[41:41.910 --> 41:43.150]  I would also agree.
[41:43.150 --> 41:43.910]  Payton.
[41:45.210 --> 41:47.870]  Very much bring the company a live drop.
[41:48.790 --> 41:49.490]  Is what it is.
[41:49.650 --> 41:50.870]  Here's what we're going to do.
[41:51.050 --> 41:52.610]  Can we get one of those
[41:53.020 --> 41:54.470]  one of each of those three items
[41:55.550 --> 41:57.250]  Eric, so that we can take it somewhere
[41:57.250 --> 41:58.530]  in Austin and bury it.
[41:58.690 --> 42:01.270]  And then figure out how to give the audience the coordinates to find it.
[42:02.330 --> 42:03.410]  I'll get the items.
[42:03.510 --> 42:05.050]  I don't want anything to do with
[42:05.050 --> 42:06.050]  any of the rest of this.
[42:07.510 --> 42:08.470]  I don't like
[42:09.990 --> 42:10.410]  burying.
[42:10.410 --> 42:11.930]  I don't like giving coordinates.
[42:12.990 --> 42:14.110]  The funny thing is
[42:14.110 --> 42:16.610]  you can give the coordinates to the middle of a baseball field
[42:16.610 --> 42:17.910]  if you wanted to be carnage.
[42:19.030 --> 42:20.370]  Yeah, I mean it is just
[42:20.370 --> 42:21.390]  I don't want anything to do.
[42:21.470 --> 42:23.270]  I'll get you the items, but that's it.
[42:23.790 --> 42:24.230]  Sounds good.
[42:25.910 --> 42:28.350]  Would you give me a ride to my burial spot?
[42:30.230 --> 42:32.330]  Where you're going to be buried, absolutely.
[42:34.970 --> 42:36.350]  I've determined that I only
[42:36.350 --> 42:38.350]  ever get a ride with Eric if we're about
[42:38.350 --> 42:39.210]  to do something weird.
[42:42.490 --> 42:43.810]  The jackhammer?
[42:44.130 --> 42:45.290]  That was good, the jackhammer was there.
[42:47.270 --> 42:48.590]  We moved
[42:49.270 --> 42:50.830]  a couch the other day.
[42:51.050 --> 42:52.810]  We helped move a couch.
[42:53.850 --> 42:54.570]  Very weird.
[42:54.950 --> 42:56.090]  Weird situations.
[42:57.390 --> 42:58.570]  How did you get
[42:58.570 --> 43:00.530]  roped into moving somebody's couch?
[43:01.390 --> 43:02.710]  I really
[43:02.710 --> 43:04.330]  like, I love
[43:04.330 --> 43:05.170]  helping people move.
[43:05.170 --> 43:06.690]  And that may sound strange.
[43:07.130 --> 43:09.350]  I hate moving my own stuff.
[43:09.490 --> 43:11.310]  But if it's other people's shit, love it.
[43:11.650 --> 43:12.590]  I'll do that all day.
[43:13.110 --> 43:14.090]  That's so interesting.
[43:14.110 --> 43:16.390]  I had to move a couch recently
[43:17.050 --> 43:18.870]  into my storage unit and
[43:19.550 --> 43:21.350]  I just waited until
[43:21.350 --> 43:23.610]  Gavin was at my house
[43:23.610 --> 43:24.670]  and he couldn't leave.
[43:24.930 --> 43:25.770]  That makes sense.
[43:25.910 --> 43:28.310]  So Eric went already.
[43:28.990 --> 43:30.770]  And then I arrived before Eric
[43:30.770 --> 43:32.430]  and we kind of did it before Eric even arrived.
[43:32.430 --> 43:34.550]  I showed up and I was like
[43:34.550 --> 43:36.150]  I guess I'll supervise.
[43:36.350 --> 43:37.870]  Good work. Yeah, get it in there.
[43:37.970 --> 43:40.270]  The strange thing was, when we were taking it to
[43:40.270 --> 43:41.250]  its next location,
[43:42.150 --> 43:44.190]  you just decided to walk next to us
[43:44.190 --> 43:46.310]  instead of bringing all the cushions, which I thought
[43:46.310 --> 43:46.930]  was a strange move.
[43:49.150 --> 43:50.370]  I'm supervising. I'm making sure
[43:50.370 --> 43:52.150]  it's all on the up and up, you know?
[43:52.210 --> 43:52.830]  You did a great job.
[43:55.030 --> 43:56.050]  That whole job site
[43:56.050 --> 43:57.430]  worked perfectly.
[43:58.870 --> 43:59.690]  I'm glad you like it.
[43:59.690 --> 44:01.570]  As somebody who doesn't drive,
[44:01.790 --> 44:03.510]  Gavin, it's wild to think that
[44:03.510 --> 44:04.930]  you got roped into moving.
[44:05.490 --> 44:07.710]  You'd just be so low on the list as someone who doesn't
[44:07.710 --> 44:08.430]  actively drive.
[44:08.430 --> 44:10.870]  I took an Uber to help someone move.
[44:12.950 --> 44:13.610]  Part of it
[44:13.610 --> 44:15.710]  might also be, Andrew, I make
[44:15.710 --> 44:17.530]  a point in my life of
[44:17.530 --> 44:19.330]  never asking anyone for anything.
[44:19.690 --> 44:21.350]  Not like never, but
[44:21.350 --> 44:23.570]  almost never. So that on the
[44:23.570 --> 44:25.750]  rare, rare, rare occasion where I can't
[44:25.750 --> 44:27.290]  figure it out on my own and I need help,
[44:27.290 --> 44:29.290]  people are so taken aback by the fact
[44:29.290 --> 44:31.230]  that I'm asking, they don't think to say no.
[44:32.310 --> 44:32.670]  Ah!
[44:33.090 --> 44:35.190]  That's a life pro tip for you. Never asking
[44:35.190 --> 44:37.370]  anyone for anything ever. So on the
[44:37.370 --> 44:39.190]  rare occasion when you actually need help,
[44:39.410 --> 44:41.070]  they'll be more confused
[44:41.070 --> 44:43.450]  that you asked and they'll help.
[44:43.630 --> 44:45.330]  Do I have one of those banks with you then?
[44:45.390 --> 44:47.450]  Because I feel like I'm not a big asker either.
[44:49.090 --> 44:50.830]  Oh, you definitely have one of those banks.
[44:50.850 --> 44:53.430]  I mean, yeah, man, you have a lifetime of those
[44:53.430 --> 44:55.310]  with me. You used one not too long ago, but you
[44:55.310 --> 44:56.790]  have a lifetime of them.
[44:57.430 --> 44:58.450]  A lifetime of them.
[44:59.190 --> 45:01.270]  I mean, if you
[45:01.270 --> 45:03.270]  can cash in...
[45:03.270 --> 45:05.450]  Dude, you can cash in daily
[45:05.450 --> 45:06.810]  if you want to. I don't care.
[45:10.040 --> 45:11.180]  Do you have anything that you're
[45:11.180 --> 45:12.720]  thinking about cashing in on, Gavin?
[45:12.840 --> 45:14.020]  Well, it's definitely something to think about.
[45:15.380 --> 45:17.240]  Yeah, that was why I asked.
[45:18.220 --> 45:19.340]  The answer was no.
[45:20.540 --> 45:21.480]  But I appreciate
[45:21.480 --> 45:23.080]  you fancied it up. You really
[45:23.080 --> 45:23.980]  styled that no.
[45:25.280 --> 45:25.940]  Good
[45:25.940 --> 45:27.340]  job, man.
[45:28.720 --> 45:29.560]  That's what?
[45:30.140 --> 45:31.940]  15 years of podcasting at work
[45:31.940 --> 45:32.840]  right there.
[45:34.120 --> 45:35.760]  Sharpen those skills.
[45:36.000 --> 45:37.900]  No, listen. I'm
[45:37.900 --> 45:39.900]  impressed. Iron is sharp
[45:39.900 --> 45:41.360]  over there.
[45:43.830 --> 45:45.470]  Maybe I could have you take over
[45:45.470 --> 45:46.690]  one of my handjob shifts.
[45:48.350 --> 45:49.010]  What?
[45:49.550 --> 45:50.910]  From last week?
[45:51.550 --> 45:53.770]  Yeah, I could throw in a shift
[45:53.770 --> 45:55.710]  at the handjob. But that was your whole
[45:55.710 --> 45:57.390]  dream, wasn't it?
[45:57.670 --> 45:59.930]  Every dream becomes a job
[45:59.930 --> 46:00.750]  if you do it wrong.
[46:01.410 --> 46:02.370]  That's true.
[46:04.010 --> 46:05.370]  Have you ever dreamt you were at work?
[46:05.690 --> 46:06.110]  Just working?
[46:09.830 --> 46:11.630]  I had more dreams from back at school.
[46:12.990 --> 46:13.830]  I've never dreamt
[46:13.830 --> 46:14.450]  I was working.
[46:16.390 --> 46:17.750]  I've dreamt that I've
[46:18.710 --> 46:19.830]  been in
[46:19.830 --> 46:21.730]  UFC fights, and those are
[46:21.730 --> 46:22.310]  terrible dreams.
[46:23.770 --> 46:25.870]  It's like somehow I've been
[46:25.870 --> 46:27.130]  signed up for this event,
[46:27.570 --> 46:29.530]  and I'm doing the walkout to the cage,
[46:29.750 --> 46:31.930]  and I'm just going, I don't know how to fight.
[46:32.410 --> 46:33.310]  How did I get here?
[46:33.810 --> 46:35.330]  Why is this happening to me?
[46:35.390 --> 46:36.910]  I love dreams where you stop beyond
[46:36.910 --> 46:38.970]  all the points where you could have pulled out.
[46:40.230 --> 46:40.490]  Yeah.
[46:41.430 --> 46:43.310]  But then I have to reverse that. I don't know if I talked about it on the show,
[46:43.330 --> 46:45.810]  but I have dreams where I'm trying to get home
[46:45.810 --> 46:47.670]  and I go in the wrong boat
[46:47.670 --> 46:49.630]  or something, and then I realize I'm
[46:49.630 --> 46:51.530]  in a dream, and that if I just wake up,
[46:51.690 --> 46:53.510]  I'll be in my bed, and I'm fucked.
[46:53.610 --> 46:55.970]  It's the greatest feeling. It's so exciting.
[46:56.450 --> 46:57.590]  Yeah, like a safety teleport.
[46:58.510 --> 46:58.910]  Yeah.
[46:59.210 --> 47:01.850]  It's the closest to teleporting I think I'll ever get.
[47:02.330 --> 47:03.510]  Do you ever go on a killing spree
[47:03.510 --> 47:04.350]  right before you teleport?
[47:07.490 --> 47:07.890]  Um...
[47:07.890 --> 47:09.810]  I don't know if I've ever killed
[47:09.810 --> 47:10.750]  anyone in a dream.
[47:11.490 --> 47:12.890]  That's a really interesting question.
[47:13.090 --> 47:14.710]  I've definitely had to deal with a body in a dream.
[47:15.730 --> 47:16.670]  Yeah? Yeah.
[47:16.670 --> 47:18.310]  I once dreamt
[47:18.310 --> 47:19.210]  that I killed Ray.
[47:19.730 --> 47:21.350]  I had to fight it.
[47:21.530 --> 47:24.670]  It might be the most relieved I've ever been
[47:24.670 --> 47:25.270]  to wake up.
[47:26.370 --> 47:28.170]  Because I don't even know how he died.
[47:28.270 --> 47:29.030]  I just had his body.
[47:31.210 --> 47:32.190]  That made me think.
[47:32.850 --> 47:34.550]  Technically not a work dream,
[47:34.690 --> 47:36.650]  but I dreamt years
[47:36.650 --> 47:38.130]  ago, before I even
[47:38.550 --> 47:40.470]  worked at Achievement Hunter in any capacity,
[47:41.030 --> 47:42.290]  I dreamt that I worked there
[47:42.290 --> 47:44.150]  and got fired on my first day.
[47:45.210 --> 47:45.990]  Because I made
[47:45.990 --> 47:47.590]  an inappropriate joke.
[47:47.770 --> 47:48.730]  I was let go.
[47:50.450 --> 47:52.150]  Was it from your joke book?
[47:53.470 --> 47:53.950]  No.
[47:54.670 --> 47:55.610]  It wasn't that inappropriate.
[47:55.710 --> 47:57.630]  I think it was
[47:58.790 --> 47:59.750]  something to do with
[48:00.230 --> 48:02.310]  making a Nazi joke of some kind.
[48:03.370 --> 48:04.550]  And I was let go.
[48:05.330 --> 48:06.670]  And the office was in the mall.
[48:07.330 --> 48:08.510]  Why would you even start to broach
[48:08.510 --> 48:10.190]  what the joke is on this podcast?
[48:10.570 --> 48:12.150]  Because it wasn't an offensive...
[48:12.910 --> 48:14.290]  I'm just saying the genre.
[48:14.850 --> 48:16.110]  It had something to do with
[48:16.110 --> 48:17.350]  Hitler, I think.
[48:18.690 --> 48:19.650]  I want to say.
[48:20.570 --> 48:22.050]  And then when we first did Let's Play,
[48:22.470 --> 48:24.350]  we made a Worms
[48:24.350 --> 48:26.270]  video. It was the first thing we did.
[48:26.790 --> 48:28.210]  And I tried to
[48:28.210 --> 48:29.770]  name my worm, Baby Hitler.
[48:29.990 --> 48:31.770]  And I had a flashback of my dream.
[48:32.270 --> 48:34.470]  Of am I going to get fired on my first Let's Play?
[48:35.290 --> 48:36.150]  Was I predicting
[48:36.150 --> 48:36.670]  the future?
[48:38.290 --> 48:40.190]  But it got blocked out. The name wasn't shown.
[48:41.410 --> 48:42.210]  I've been...
[48:42.210 --> 48:43.070]  Sorry, go ahead.
[48:43.910 --> 48:44.630]  No, you go.
[48:46.490 --> 48:48.190]  I was just going to say, I've been
[48:48.190 --> 48:50.050]  having a series of
[48:50.050 --> 48:52.130]  recurring dreams lately. I haven't mentioned
[48:52.130 --> 48:54.090]  to you guys, but since we're talking about them, where I also
[48:54.090 --> 48:56.190]  wake up similarly relieved, but also kind of
[48:56.190 --> 48:56.710]  horrified.
[48:58.090 --> 49:00.050]  Do you remember a couple, maybe
[49:00.050 --> 49:02.010]  a month ago now, I was eating
[49:02.010 --> 49:04.150]  a piece of Mike and Ike's, and my
[49:04.150 --> 49:05.490]  fucking tooth fell out? Yes.
[49:05.810 --> 49:07.990]  And I had to go get my crown put back on?
[49:08.730 --> 49:10.050]  Pretty much since that
[49:10.050 --> 49:11.930]  day, I almost every
[49:11.930 --> 49:13.970]  night, I have a dream that I have to
[49:13.970 --> 49:15.950]  eat candy. Like somebody's making
[49:15.950 --> 49:18.110]  me eat chewy candy and I don't want to
[49:18.110 --> 49:20.010]  and all my teeth fall out. And then
[49:20.010 --> 49:21.970]  I wake up. I have woke up with
[49:21.970 --> 49:23.810]  my hand at my mouth to catch my teeth.
[49:24.330 --> 49:26.050]  Coming out of my mouth a couple times.
[49:26.570 --> 49:27.950]  And it's the... I wake up
[49:27.950 --> 49:29.970]  horrified and then so instantly relieved
[49:29.970 --> 49:31.930]  that I still have all my teeth. But it takes me
[49:31.930 --> 49:33.990]  a second every day to suss out
[49:33.990 --> 49:34.930]  what's going on.
[49:36.670 --> 49:37.130]  Sucks.
[49:37.370 --> 49:38.570]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[49:38.810 --> 49:41.110]  Gracie just wrote about a dream bubblegum
[49:41.110 --> 49:43.150]  losing teeth. Rips all her teeth out with bubblegum.
[49:43.290 --> 49:44.010]  Terrible. Yeah. Ugh.
[49:44.610 --> 49:46.850]  I don't like any of that. It's a
[49:46.850 --> 49:48.710]  relief to still have teeth, but
[49:48.710 --> 49:50.490]  man, sucks to get there. Have you
[49:50.490 --> 49:53.150]  gained a fear of people named Mike and Ike?
[49:53.650 --> 49:54.810]  Are they up on the
[49:54.810 --> 49:56.230]  intimidating list for you?
[49:56.710 --> 49:58.270]  Oddly, I think it's
[49:58.270 --> 50:00.890]  if anything, it's improved the name
[50:00.890 --> 50:02.810]  Mike and Ike to me. I feel better
[50:02.810 --> 50:04.810]  about Mike and Ike as humans. I don't
[50:04.810 --> 50:06.990]  want to eat the candy anymore. I don't want to eat any candy anymore.
[50:07.210 --> 50:08.730]  I'm like, I'm scared of all
[50:08.730 --> 50:10.650]  candy now. Which is probably a good thing.
[50:11.050 --> 50:12.750]  But, uh, yeah, no,
[50:12.870 --> 50:14.810]  I just wish I didn't have these fucking dreams all
[50:14.810 --> 50:16.750]  the time. I've not come across a lot of Ikes.
[50:17.770 --> 50:18.690]  No, neither have I.
[50:18.870 --> 50:20.170]  Ike Baramult, who is
[50:21.130 --> 50:21.990]  Mike and Ike.
[50:22.550 --> 50:24.190]  I just assume they made the candy.
[50:24.970 --> 50:26.330]  You think Mike and Ike are real people?
[50:27.010 --> 50:28.050]  I assume so. They were.
[50:29.050 --> 50:30.130]  I don't know who they are.
[50:32.250 --> 50:32.790]  Uh...
[50:33.830 --> 50:34.370]  Uh...
[50:34.370 --> 50:36.210]  Why did Mike and Ike... Mike and Ike
[50:36.210 --> 50:38.390]  broke up? Due to creative
[50:38.390 --> 50:40.210]  differences in the candy, Mike
[50:40.210 --> 50:42.210]  left to pursue a music career
[50:42.210 --> 50:44.290]  while Ike pursued a career in art.
[50:46.230 --> 50:46.710]  What's going on
[50:46.710 --> 50:47.370]  with Mike and Ike?
[50:48.150 --> 50:50.210]  Are they at a reunion? Is Ike short
[50:50.210 --> 50:51.850]  for something? Ikel.
[50:56.270 --> 50:58.290]  Do you think it's short for
[50:58.290 --> 50:58.690]  Ikel?
[51:01.590 --> 51:02.730]  You killed Geoff!
[51:03.530 --> 51:04.570]  In the legal documents,
[51:04.870 --> 51:05.990]  when they started the business,
[51:06.210 --> 51:07.510]  it was Michael and Ikel.
[51:08.350 --> 51:09.370]  Oh my god.
[51:09.630 --> 51:11.910]  Well, surely we can't call these candies
[51:11.910 --> 51:13.870]  Michael and Ikel. You've gotta change.
[51:14.990 --> 51:16.190]  They're a fucking one! It's
[51:16.190 --> 51:18.090]  Ikel! No, man, it's Ike now.
[51:18.170 --> 51:19.550]  Yeah, I have no idea. What is that short for?
[51:20.230 --> 51:21.330]  I have no idea. I have no clue.
[51:22.470 --> 51:24.090]  You know what? I don't want to look it up.
[51:24.150 --> 51:25.250]  I want it to be short for Ikel.
[51:28.750 --> 51:30.050]  I never understood
[51:30.050 --> 51:30.770]  the whole, like,
[51:32.110 --> 51:33.530]  Hank being Henry
[51:33.530 --> 51:34.990]  and John being Jack.
[51:35.210 --> 51:36.950]  I just don't know how
[51:36.950 --> 51:38.530]  one name could be another name.
[51:39.990 --> 51:41.270]  Always confuse me.
[51:42.310 --> 51:42.590]  Ikel.
[51:43.110 --> 51:45.110]  We're gonna keep with Ikel. I looked up the answer.
[51:45.230 --> 51:46.110]  We're gonna keep with Ikel.
[51:46.330 --> 51:47.610]  It's definitely Ikel.
[51:48.110 --> 51:51.350]  I bet the real answer sucks, huh?
[51:51.430 --> 51:52.650]  It does, so that's why we're
[51:52.650 --> 51:53.330]  keeping with Ikel.
[51:53.330 --> 51:53.810]  Uh...
[51:55.250 --> 51:57.050]  Do you ever...
[51:57.050 --> 51:59.070]  I had a weird thought the other day.
[51:59.450 --> 52:00.990]  Are you ever relieved that you
[52:00.990 --> 52:02.930]  speak English over a different language?
[52:03.350 --> 52:04.310]  That that's what you were taught?
[52:05.270 --> 52:07.550]  Uh, no. I was looking at
[52:07.550 --> 52:08.230]  Canada.
[52:09.090 --> 52:11.130]  A lot of things have English
[52:11.130 --> 52:12.170]  and French on them.
[52:12.770 --> 52:14.890]  I learned a little bit of French, but
[52:14.890 --> 52:16.290]  not a lot.
[52:16.850 --> 52:18.710]  This is the English word
[52:19.200 --> 52:19.510]  relief.
[52:20.570 --> 52:21.610]  This is
[52:21.610 --> 52:23.710]  the French word
[52:24.450 --> 52:25.570]  for relief.
[52:26.790 --> 52:27.790]  It's so much
[52:27.790 --> 52:28.610]  more complicated.
[52:29.170 --> 52:31.150]  I was really good at spelling
[52:31.150 --> 52:33.330]  in school, and I just
[52:33.330 --> 52:35.050]  don't think I would've been in a different language.
[52:35.250 --> 52:37.510]  That is so much more work for the same
[52:37.510 --> 52:39.430]  word. I feel like Germany overindexes
[52:39.430 --> 52:39.870]  in that.
[52:40.790 --> 52:42.750]  German words are very long.
[52:43.810 --> 52:45.550]  I just, I'd never considered that
[52:45.550 --> 52:47.290]  a US spelling champion
[52:47.290 --> 52:49.190]  being less impressive to me than
[52:49.190 --> 52:50.410]  a French spelling champion.
[52:51.310 --> 52:53.090]  I think English is probably the easiest
[52:53.090 --> 52:55.290]  language to be a
[52:55.290 --> 52:57.150]  spelling champion. I don't know.
[52:57.270 --> 52:58.870]  I think part of the problem with English,
[52:59.050 --> 53:01.150]  it seems intuitive to you because you know it, but
[53:01.150 --> 53:02.930]  it's a mishmash of
[53:03.450 --> 53:05.150]  styles and rules and other
[53:05.150 --> 53:07.250]  languages and words that contradict each other.
[53:07.650 --> 53:09.250]  I think it probably doesn't make a whole hell of a lot
[53:09.250 --> 53:11.190]  of sense to try to sit down and
[53:11.190 --> 53:13.130]  learn it. I wonder if you would
[53:13.130 --> 53:15.330]  learn the rules of another
[53:15.330 --> 53:16.970]  language and it would just be
[53:17.570 --> 53:18.930]  honestly a better
[53:18.930 --> 53:21.370]  built language. It might actually make it
[53:21.370 --> 53:23.450]  a lot easier. I don't know. I've always wondered
[53:23.450 --> 53:25.310]  that. It's definitely built
[53:25.310 --> 53:27.450]  better, I assume. I know English is a mess
[53:27.450 --> 53:29.530]  but it's just purely on a level
[53:29.530 --> 53:31.530]  of memorization of letters.
[53:32.170 --> 53:33.390]  It is easy. I found this German
[53:33.390 --> 53:34.410]  word that apparently means
[53:35.050 --> 53:37.170]  an insurance company that provides legal
[53:37.170 --> 53:37.690]  protection.
[53:41.590 --> 53:42.590]  It is
[53:42.590 --> 53:45.130]  R-E-C-H-T-S
[53:45.130 --> 53:46.690]  S-H-U-T-Z
[53:48.190 --> 53:51.150]  V-E-R-S-I-C-H-E-R
[53:52.230 --> 53:53.990]  U-N-G-S
[53:54.550 --> 53:56.850]  G-E-S-E-L-L-S-H
[53:56.850 --> 53:58.670]  A-F-T-E-N. How do they
[53:58.670 --> 53:59.730]  do business cards?
[54:00.690 --> 54:02.590]  I'm a fan of any word that ends in
[54:02.590 --> 54:03.710]  Shafton, to be honest.
[54:04.790 --> 54:05.550]  Shafton's good.
[54:08.800 --> 54:10.320]  Have you ever put that
[54:10.320 --> 54:12.500]  word into Google, Gavin, and tried to hear
[54:12.500 --> 54:13.860]  how they would translate it?
[54:14.660 --> 54:15.420]  Oh, that's a good call.
[54:15.500 --> 54:18.280]  It always...
[54:18.280 --> 54:20.260]  It sounds terrible in English.
[54:20.440 --> 54:21.500]  I can't imagine that.
[54:29.900 --> 54:33.940]  Oh, I found a video.
[54:34.200 --> 54:36.460]  Nick's like a baby.
[54:36.600 --> 54:37.940]  I just make funny noises and he
[54:38.470 --> 54:38.900]  kills them.
[54:42.500 --> 54:43.840]  A little baby down there.
[54:45.480 --> 54:46.420]  No, Nick,
[54:46.540 --> 54:47.420]  don't. No.
[54:49.620 --> 54:50.400]  Don't. You
[54:50.400 --> 54:52.440]  crossed the line. Wow, it said real
[54:52.440 --> 54:54.380]  quick in German. Alright, say it.
[54:55.040 --> 54:56.600]  Like, I just, I can't.
[54:56.780 --> 54:58.080]  I mean, the German... Well, just copy what it...
[54:58.080 --> 55:00.000]  You just heard it. Just copy. You just heard it. Just say it.
[55:01.080 --> 55:01.800]  It's hard.
[55:02.080 --> 55:03.480]  Just look at this.
[55:04.020 --> 55:06.320]  It's harder than it looks. Oh, shit.
[55:06.320 --> 55:07.640]  What's that? Is that the real link?
[55:08.320 --> 55:10.280]  It's a Google link. What are you doing, man?
[55:11.080 --> 55:12.380]  Google says it, then you
[55:12.380 --> 55:13.480]  say it.
[55:13.960 --> 55:16.260]  You both weren't showing up, so I couldn't
[55:16.260 --> 55:18.200]  quite hear it. I didn't say fucking
[55:18.200 --> 55:18.540]  anything.
[55:20.540 --> 55:22.300]  Why are you sending me a video that's
[55:22.300 --> 55:24.460]  a minute long? I don't know why it's a minute long.
[55:24.540 --> 55:25.760]  I don't know why the guy made it a minute long.
[55:26.420 --> 55:27.960]  Gavin... so you can monetize it.
[55:28.740 --> 55:29.920]  Gavin is right.
[55:30.420 --> 55:32.260]  He says it so
[55:32.260 --> 55:34.400]  fast. And then to have
[55:34.400 --> 55:36.160]  to repeat that? No
[55:36.160 --> 55:38.280]  fucking shot. Everybody shut
[55:38.280 --> 55:39.640]  up for three seconds.

[55:56.300 --> 55:57.440]  a lawyer that I like.
[55:58.080 --> 56:00.080]  What would you recommend if I need something fixed
[56:00.080 --> 56:01.500]  but I also need legal advice?
[56:02.820 --> 56:04.240]  Oh, I see. You definitely want to

[56:09.020 --> 56:09.400]  you are
[56:10.700 --> 56:13.020]  going full offensive. No, I'm just saying the word.
[56:13.440 --> 56:14.600]  Are you saying it?
[56:15.680 --> 56:16.900]  I am, yeah. According
[56:16.900 --> 56:17.320]  to Google.
[56:18.580 --> 56:20.140]  If it's wrong, it's Google's fault.
[56:20.640 --> 56:22.340]  It's not my fault. Geoff, did you get ears on it?
[56:23.500 --> 56:24.800]  You guys are talking. Hold on a second.
[56:24.880 --> 56:25.620]  If you're quiet right now.

[56:32.540 --> 56:33.240]  Easy
[56:33.240 --> 56:36.580]  I didn't realize the Swedish chef spoke
[56:36.580 --> 56:38.800]  German is what I've learned from this.
[56:40.380 --> 56:42.520]  Because it sounds very
[56:42.520 --> 56:43.940]  Swedish chef-ish

[56:57.040 --> 57:00.600]  I like Swedish Geoff a lot.
[57:00.600 --> 57:02.660]  Speaking of Swedish Geoff,
[57:02.820 --> 57:04.600]  I've been
[57:05.220 --> 57:05.840]  having an idea.
[57:06.840 --> 57:08.260]  And I don't know how to bring it up with you guys,
[57:08.320 --> 57:09.980]  because I don't know how it will affect the podcast.
[57:10.240 --> 57:12.740]  Maybe we can come up with some creative solutions
[57:12.740 --> 57:13.180]  for it.
[57:15.620 --> 57:16.160]  It's been
[57:16.620 --> 57:18.620]  nagging at me for a couple weeks now.
[57:19.740 --> 57:20.540]  And it's
[57:20.540 --> 57:22.580]  not going away. I haven't talked about it with anybody yet.
[57:22.840 --> 57:24.160]  But I've been
[57:25.200 --> 57:26.320]  lately feeling very
[57:26.320 --> 57:28.000]  taciturn in general.
[57:28.540 --> 57:29.960]  What the fuck?
[57:30.040 --> 57:31.420]  You've been feeling what? Taciturn?
[57:31.820 --> 57:33.860]  What? Is that one of your new words?
[57:34.160 --> 57:35.220]  Like germane and...
[57:35.220 --> 57:36.280]  What was the other one?
[57:36.280 --> 57:38.880]  Just like brief and short.
[57:40.140 --> 57:42.020]  Also not like the word you used?
[57:42.960 --> 57:43.520]  It's a fucking
[57:43.520 --> 57:45.980]  perfectly normal word. Taciturn.
[57:46.120 --> 57:47.260]  I don't understand what your problem is.
[57:48.860 --> 57:49.740]  So normal.
[57:50.340 --> 57:50.860]  And uh...
[57:50.860 --> 57:54.080]  I gotta start a podcast with non-idiots someday.
[57:54.220 --> 57:56.000]  T-A-C-I-T-
[57:56.000 --> 57:57.340]  Bernie was so annoying.
[57:57.460 --> 57:59.220]  At least he had a fucking vocabulary.
[57:59.900 --> 58:00.440]  Anyway...
[58:01.180 --> 58:02.600]  I've been thinking...
[58:02.600 --> 58:04.160]  It's not normal.
[58:04.680 --> 58:06.280]  It's totally fucking normal.
[58:07.440 --> 58:09.000]  To understand words.
[58:09.240 --> 58:10.900]  Anyway, I've been thinking...
[58:10.900 --> 58:14.020]  It's really fucking driving it home to me right now.
[58:14.600 --> 58:15.780]  For the last couple weeks I've been thinking
[58:15.780 --> 58:17.280]  I've had a strong urge
[58:17.280 --> 58:19.140]  to take a vow of silence.
[58:20.240 --> 58:20.460]  Oh.
[58:21.760 --> 58:22.760]  For how long?
[58:22.760 --> 58:24.300]  I don't know.
[58:25.220 --> 58:26.380]  Yeah, that could affect the podcast.
[58:27.180 --> 58:27.440]  I know.
[58:27.700 --> 58:30.180]  Yeah, so you know, the thing that we're about to go do...
[58:30.180 --> 58:31.780]  You think that now is the time for that?
[58:32.060 --> 58:34.180]  Yeah, I think... No, I don't think it is.
[58:34.240 --> 58:35.380]  I think I'm gonna have to figure it out.
[58:35.440 --> 58:36.300]  I think it could be complicated.
[58:36.500 --> 58:38.860]  But I'm having an intense desire
[58:38.860 --> 58:41.760]  to not speak out loud at all
[58:41.760 --> 58:43.120]  to anyone ever.
[58:43.460 --> 58:45.200]  So you yourself would be taciturn?
[58:46.140 --> 58:48.220]  Well, I think I'm fairly taciturn as it is
[58:48.220 --> 58:50.020]  the last six months or so.
[58:50.020 --> 58:51.840]  But it's just progressing.
[58:52.180 --> 58:53.520]  I feel like it's leading somewhere.
[58:54.080 --> 58:56.000]  And I just wanna... I've been thinking a lot
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.900]  about monks and how they just don't talk for
[58:59.280 --> 59:00.600]  an undefined period of time.
[59:00.760 --> 59:02.260]  And I just don't know.
[59:02.320 --> 59:03.560]  There's something appealing in that to me.
[59:03.740 --> 59:04.240]  I've done that.
[59:06.240 --> 59:06.800]  How long?
[59:06.880 --> 59:08.660]  Oh, you did. You did it for years.
[59:09.280 --> 59:10.660]  I don't recommend it.
[59:12.500 --> 59:14.260]  But you talked outside of school, right?
[59:15.240 --> 59:15.880]  Yeah, a little bit.
[59:16.480 --> 59:17.140]  Yeah, a little bit.
[59:18.320 --> 59:20.020]  I feel like it might be different for me
[59:20.020 --> 59:22.460]  at 48 than it was for you at 6.
[59:22.720 --> 59:24.400]  It would completely end
[59:24.400 --> 59:25.660]  most things in your life.
[59:27.200 --> 59:27.520]  I mean,
[59:27.760 --> 59:29.720]  can we come up with clever ways to communicate?
[59:29.880 --> 59:31.760]  What if I had a really robust soundboard
[59:31.760 --> 59:33.220]  of things I've already said?
[59:33.800 --> 59:36.040]  You're just communicating. You're just making it harder.
[59:36.320 --> 59:37.400]  Yeah, that's just...
[59:37.400 --> 59:40.120]  What are you, Andrew? That seems like an Andrew idea.
[59:40.560 --> 59:41.060]  Yeah, it does.
[59:41.360 --> 59:43.220]  So it'd be like, Geoff, what do you want for lunch?
[59:45.240 --> 59:47.360]  Well, yeah,
[59:47.400 --> 59:48.340]  if I hit the wrong button.
[59:53.080 --> 59:54.240]  You know...
[59:54.240 --> 59:55.400]  It's so stupid.
[59:55.920 --> 59:57.260]  It's so stupid.
[59:57.660 --> 59:58.140]  Clearly,
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:02.380]  the podcast
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.180]  is my priority over my own
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:05.860]  personal mental health
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.860]  and well-being,
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.300]  but I'm hoping
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.480]  we can come up with some sort of creative solution here.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.640]  Maybe I just
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.140]  don't talk 23 hours a day,
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.800]  or 6 days a week,
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.540]  but then one day I talk, like on Thursdays,
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:21.220]  I talk for an hour.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.220]  Stop talking to Emily, talk to us.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.620]  I've stopped talking to most people.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.820]  What if you just operate like an old electric meter?
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.660]  We put some money in,
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.120]  and then we buy ourselves 40 minutes of talk.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:33.460]  Oh.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.960]  Well, that's interesting.
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:38.040]  Like, say you wanted to look
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.080]  at the Empire State Building,
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:40.760]  or
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.540]  the Golden Gate Bridge from...
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:44.200]  Yeah, interesting.
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.620]  Yeah, just put a little coin slot somewhere on you.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.500]  I have two...
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.720]  I have two thoughts, Geoff.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.520]  One, we do a supplemental
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.640]  quiet cast.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.460]  This is just silence.
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.500]  See how long before anyone
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.320]  is willing to speak?
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.220]  I think some people would fold over time.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.200]  Second thing,
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.480]  maybe we do like
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.600]  a day of silence going into recording
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.920]  to see how it feels.
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:12.880]  I'm willing to not talk to anybody for a day.
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.260]  Take a full day of silence.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.860]  We don't speak for 24 hours.
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:17.940]  We start the podcast.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.960]  Now that's interesting.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:21.260]  That's interesting to me.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.500]  We're all coming into it on an even footing.
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.340]  Well, I am.
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:28.000]  I don't think this will be tough.
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.740]  I don't think this will change anything,
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:30.940]  but I'm willing to do it with you.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:33.660]  I feel like everyone is going to need to do it,
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:35.580]  including Eric, Nick, and Gracie.
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.780]  I don't think that's...
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:37.940]  No.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.900]  No? Okay, nevermind.
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:42.120]  Everyone seems on board.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.800]  I just assumed people wouldn't be on board.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:48.040]  Eric can't do his job.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:49.120]  Right.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.460]  Yeah, because he lost it.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.080]  What's your point?
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.420]  Andrew's trying to save it with a bobblehead
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.880]  and a plunger. We're fine.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.680]  The company is in the
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.740]  shit, so I got the plunger coming.
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.440]  We're going to clear out of there.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.480]  Sneak on through.
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.720]  It's also not something I have to do today.
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:09.860]  Maybe that'll be what I do after I retire.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.640]  Or maybe I'll take a vacation
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.400]  and have a quiet vacation.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.540]  But I like the idea of us trying it out
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.920]  for a period of time all together.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.420]  Yeah, I wonder if it'll have
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:21.800]  icy hot on the ear effects
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.560]  on the podcast.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.400]  I also wonder.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.540]  We didn't do ears, did we? We did balls.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.740]  Yeah, do you think that...
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.320]  Do you think
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.500]  if you took an extended vow of silence
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.580]  you could really zone in by putting
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.820]  icy hot on your balls and staying silent?
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.580]  Like you'd really hone in
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:40.240]  on the silence?
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.800]  Nah, it would just be desk plunger.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.240]  No, yeah, I think I'd hurt myself.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:46.920]  Elevated silence?
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.280]  No? Okay.
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:51.200]  Maybe that's advanced.
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.100]  Let's walk before we run.
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.720]  Okay. Well, we need to wrap
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.600]  this one up. We only
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.440]  have a few of these left, so I really
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.440]  feel like you guys should leave people with
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.060]  something really strong here.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.920]  Could you walk on icy hot?
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:06.720]  What do you mean?
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.120]  If the floor was icy hot,
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:10.560]  would it hurt?
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:12.360]  Yeah.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.140]  We gotta do that.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.680]  I feel like
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.780]  the bottoms of my feet are very resistant.
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:21.440]  Do you think you'd taste the icy hot
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.560]  like garlic? Oh.
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.980]  You'd be putting so much...
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:26.900]  You rub icy hot on your arm
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:29.020]  and then it slowly, I don't know,
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.220]  it permeates into the skin.
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.940]  But if you were standing on it, you'd have all the
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:35.060]  weight of you pushing down on the
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:37.160]  icy hot, compressing it and forcing
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.000]  it into you. And you'd be
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.880]  surrounded by... I bet maybe we should do an
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.900]  icy hot foot bag foot race.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:44.820]  What about an icy
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:45.860]  hot slip and slide?
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:47.200]  Oh!
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.780]  God, that would be fucking great.
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.840]  Andrew! First off,
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.000]  Gavin, yes. Yes. Andrew,
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:56.820]  yes. We need to have the
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.840]  icy hot summer games where we
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.660]  just do shit in somebody's backyard
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.040]  but it's all icy hot.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.960]  How much
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.840]  money's worth of icy hot are we gonna have to buy for a
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.880]  slip and slide? We're gonna need to get a
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.920]  sponsorship. I wish that there was
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.840]  just icy. Icy hot,
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.800]  if you're
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.700]  listening to this, get
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:18.720]  after us. Let us know. Yeah, or
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.940]  tiger balm or
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.240]  uh...
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:25.060]  Psylliderm or any of the other companies that make them.
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.060]  Yeah, Psylliderm.
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:27.800]  I don't know, I made that up.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:30.820]  Hey, Psylliderm, if you're listening to this.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.680]  Derma ice or
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:34.960]  uh... And if we don't reply for a
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.580]  day, we were just in a vow of silence.
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:37.460]  Yeah.
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.460]  Okay, wrap this up. We gotta go.
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.180]  Alright, yeah, everybody's gonna leave
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.740]  with something important you said,
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.960]  Eric, so I'll go first.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.760]  You are going to leave people with something
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.960]  important because we only have a few of these left, so go ahead.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.220]  Here we go, and then somebody just go after me.
[01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:59.810]  You gonna go and then someone else will go?
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:04.860]  That was it.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.060]  I gave the gift of silence.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.460]  Pretty taciturn of you.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:11.680]  Thank you.
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.920]  Nick has to edit all that, like
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.080]  the sound effects in. They're like not
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:21.980]  in the recording.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.040]  Nobody else got anything, okay.
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:34.640]  Perfect.
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:41.250]  Hey guys, MajorLeagueFan
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.140]  Jack here with a look at next week's
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.100]  episode of F*** Face. We are
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.200]  nearing the end and still trying to catch up,
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.360]  so here are some predictions for next week's episode.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.400]  Andrew can't take it anymore.
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.700]  Geoff has yet another house problem.
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.480]  Gavin is planning a trip back
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.500]  to Sloppy Joe's. The boys have to
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:59.400]  change their name. Eric wants them
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.380]  to finish on time, for real this
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:03.500]  time. Nick isn't wearing the mask.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.440]  And once again, Andrew does not eat
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.500]  the pencil. All that and more on next week's
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.720]  episode of F*** Face.
