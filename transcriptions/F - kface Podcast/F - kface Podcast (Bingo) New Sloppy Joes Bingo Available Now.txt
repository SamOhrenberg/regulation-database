[00:00.000 --> 00:04.980]  This episode is brought to you by Pacifico. Here's a story you've probably never heard.
[00:05.440 --> 00:10.440]  Legend has it, decades ago, a couple surfers went down to Mexico in search of epic swells,
[00:10.520 --> 00:15.380]  but they found something unexpected instead. It was still crisp, lively, and smooth,
[00:15.640 --> 00:18.540]  but it had nothing to do with waves. It was Pacifico,
[00:18.800 --> 00:22.600]  a delicious Mexican lager. It's like it was brewed to be discovered.
