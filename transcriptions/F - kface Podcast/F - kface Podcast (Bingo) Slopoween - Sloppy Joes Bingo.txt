[00:00.000 --> 00:02.400]  Happy Halloween, everyone.
[00:03.040 --> 00:03.580]  Happy Halloween.
[00:04.040 --> 00:04.980]  Oh, I do see us.
[00:05.140 --> 00:06.760]  We are listed under special events.
[00:07.320 --> 00:07.900]  We are live.
[00:08.420 --> 00:09.240]  We are a special event.
[00:10.080 --> 00:11.440]  Link not working, apparently.
[00:11.540 --> 00:12.400]  What does that mean? What link?
[00:13.060 --> 00:13.420]  What link?
[00:14.780 --> 00:15.780]  Did we put a link?
[00:15.920 --> 00:17.240]  Oh, is it like the link to the cards?
[00:17.720 --> 00:17.920]  Maybe.
[00:19.260 --> 00:20.580]  Check, check the link.
[00:21.280 --> 00:21.900]  Check the link.
[00:24.740 --> 00:26.780]  Gavin, shut it down to check the link.
[00:26.860 --> 00:28.780]  Tapping into not knowing what's wrong,
[00:28.780 --> 00:31.220]  but calling out that something's wrong with no fix
[00:31.220 --> 00:32.380]  for the thing that's wrong.
[00:32.720 --> 00:35.380]  I can't think of something I despise more.
[00:35.820 --> 00:37.840]  I don't know why the link is, I'm just letting you know.
[00:38.360 --> 00:40.180]  It makes me like violently upset.
[00:40.660 --> 00:41.320]  What link?
[00:41.740 --> 00:44.780]  But if it doesn't concern you, why even talk about it?
[00:44.840 --> 00:46.020]  Because you don't know what's happening.
[00:46.240 --> 00:48.440]  Someone on this Discord call fool
[00:48.440 --> 00:49.980]  knows what I'm talking about
[00:49.980 --> 00:51.420]  and has the ability to fix it.
[00:51.460 --> 00:54.240]  Or should we just ignore it for three hours?
[00:54.480 --> 00:55.860]  No, I don't think you have to ignore it.
[00:56.320 --> 01:00.820]  And I'm sure it's a reference to something
[01:00.820 --> 01:01.800]  in the Twitch thing.
[01:01.940 --> 01:04.200]  If there's an issue, we have mods that are wonderful
[01:04.200 --> 01:05.000]  and they will help.
[01:05.620 --> 01:07.300]  You just yelling, what's the link?
[01:08.040 --> 01:08.700]  I don't know.
[01:10.540 --> 01:11.560]  Andrew, I'm with you.
[01:11.800 --> 01:14.280]  Gavin, I appreciate the assistance.
[01:15.240 --> 01:16.280]  Yeah, you did great, Gavin.
[01:16.680 --> 01:18.960]  But yeah, also at the same time, tough.
[01:19.220 --> 01:21.400]  Hey, it's Scooby-Doo and Velma, the classic pair.
[01:21.860 --> 01:23.520]  Happy Halloween, everyone.
[01:23.860 --> 01:25.520]  You did it, it's full screen, full screen.
[01:26.140 --> 01:27.960]  That's people with dog costumes.
[01:28.200 --> 01:30.660]  Oh, Guy Dressed as a Dog, I think that's one of our fucking-
[01:30.660 --> 01:31.160]  It is.
[01:31.300 --> 01:32.840]  But it's not what we're doing yet.
[01:32.900 --> 01:33.980]  It's not slop o'clock.
[01:34.080 --> 01:35.140]  We haven't started, guys.
[01:35.660 --> 01:39.700]  It's a Halloween deserted episode of Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[01:40.240 --> 01:43.940]  Welcome to the mean streets of Duval.
[01:44.880 --> 01:45.980]  No one's here.
[01:46.960 --> 01:48.280]  We don't know where they're at,
[01:48.620 --> 01:50.220]  but they'll start filing in soon.
[01:50.300 --> 01:51.880]  They were here an hour ago.
[01:51.880 --> 01:55.540]  Yeah, the sloppiness, I think,
[01:55.640 --> 01:57.620]  is only gonna get more sloppy from here on out.
[01:57.720 --> 01:59.940]  Guys, what we're doing is a regular bingo card,
[02:00.720 --> 02:03.520]  which we are getting from regulationbingo.com,
[02:04.640 --> 02:09.460]  and a special boo board that Andrew helped us put together,
[02:09.620 --> 02:12.720]  and we drafted on a Falcon event earlier this week
[02:13.640 --> 02:18.620]  with just Halloween-related things to get on.
[02:19.260 --> 02:20.100]  Look at this.
[02:20.580 --> 02:21.940]  Look at this guy.
[02:22.700 --> 02:23.140]  Oh!
[02:23.320 --> 02:24.920]  Is that guy supposed to be Dan?
[02:25.320 --> 02:26.200]  That guy's supposed to be...
[02:26.200 --> 02:27.560]  Oh, he's dressed as Dan!
[02:27.900 --> 02:28.380]  It's Dan!
[02:28.380 --> 02:28.840]  Look at that.
[02:29.040 --> 02:31.340]  It's Dan from the slo-mo, guys.
[02:31.620 --> 02:33.580]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[02:34.540 --> 02:36.020]  Except that guy just pointed at the camera.
[02:36.160 --> 02:37.120]  That dude's in way better shape than the real Dan.
[02:37.140 --> 02:38.940]  Where's your peanut butter jar?
[02:39.320 --> 02:40.160]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:40.160 --> 02:41.240]  I need you!
[02:42.060 --> 02:44.120]  It's the only chance I have!
[02:44.940 --> 02:46.100]  Oh, he didn't watch the VOD.
[02:46.500 --> 02:47.320]  It's a mini board.
[02:47.400 --> 02:48.660]  It's only got nine options
[02:48.660 --> 02:49.500]  that we drafted.
[02:49.840 --> 02:51.640]  Like Eric said, if you want to see that draft,
[02:51.740 --> 02:53.500]  if you're a Falcon Tier member over on the Patreon,
[02:53.660 --> 02:54.880]  you can go watch it.
[02:55.240 --> 02:59.760]  But do you guys want to run down your nine?
[03:00.300 --> 03:01.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:01.160 --> 03:02.200]  So that way we know what you got.
[03:02.320 --> 03:03.220]  Geoff, you want to go first?
[03:03.460 --> 03:04.180]  Yeah, I'll go first.
[03:04.300 --> 03:05.340]  Here are my nine.
[03:05.620 --> 03:06.920]  Group costumes.
[03:07.760 --> 03:11.260]  Costume collapse, aka somebody falls in costume.
[03:11.720 --> 03:14.080]  Body paint as a costume.
[03:14.660 --> 03:17.880]  I can't sit down because of an impractical
[03:17.880 --> 03:19.380]  or awkward costume.
[03:20.280 --> 03:23.300]  Regulation costume, aka tuxedo or snake eyes.
[03:23.680 --> 03:25.940]  We all also agree that snake eyes from G.I.
[03:25.960 --> 03:26.720]  Joe would count.
[03:27.720 --> 03:31.500]  Angel and devil both on the screen at the same time.
[03:31.580 --> 03:32.320]  They don't have to be together.
[03:32.400 --> 03:34.840]  They just have to both be on camera at the same time.
[03:35.160 --> 03:37.120]  Spider-Man, skeet skeet.
[03:37.660 --> 03:39.240]  Dog wearing a costume,
[03:39.780 --> 03:41.100]  which I'm pretty sure we'll see.
[03:41.180 --> 03:42.620]  And then hot dog costume.
[03:43.120 --> 03:44.480]  Oh, those are good.
[03:44.560 --> 03:45.820]  Gavin, what are your nine?
[03:45.820 --> 03:47.900]  I have Halloween themed car,
[03:48.480 --> 03:51.280]  costumed background scooter, Wolverine.
[03:51.540 --> 03:52.720]  Someone getting spooked.
[03:53.040 --> 03:54.320]  Real life dead guy.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.100]  Overdone costumes will require a majority agreement.
[03:58.620 --> 04:01.260]  Video game costume. Monster mash.
[04:02.240 --> 04:04.260]  I think we get the precursor in front of us, possibly.
[04:04.660 --> 04:07.180]  And finally, Andrew's face.
[04:07.600 --> 04:09.480]  Yep. Which we would have had.
[04:09.500 --> 04:09.900]  Which I had Dan's face.
[04:10.460 --> 04:10.880]  Wait, what?
[04:11.020 --> 04:13.920]  Like he was wearing a sloppy Drew's bingo shirt.
[04:14.140 --> 04:14.560]  That would have counted, I guess.
[04:14.560 --> 04:14.940]  Yep.
[04:16.080 --> 04:17.440]  Andrew, what are your nine?
[04:18.360 --> 04:20.020]  I just want to post first, I'm outraged.
[04:20.540 --> 04:22.280]  Fucking peanut butter jar is my center.
[04:23.200 --> 04:23.880]  I just generated.
[04:24.340 --> 04:25.760]  Mine are dude, where's my car?
[04:25.840 --> 04:26.580]  Witch without a broom.
[04:26.940 --> 04:28.440]  Gone fishing, fishnet clothing.
[04:28.860 --> 04:29.780]  Beetlejuice costume.
[04:30.300 --> 04:31.740]  Summer movie auction representative.
[04:32.280 --> 04:32.980]  Peanut butter jar.
[04:33.360 --> 04:34.240]  Doctor or nurse.
[04:34.580 --> 04:35.160]  Fake blood.
[04:35.560 --> 04:36.280]  Wrong holiday.
[04:36.800 --> 04:39.740]  Costumes of other holiday figures and scream mask.
[04:40.060 --> 04:42.260]  Very nice. Nick, what are your nine?
[04:42.980 --> 04:45.600]  I've got Halloween themed car lights.
[04:45.900 --> 04:46.460]  Deadpool.
[04:46.980 --> 04:48.060]  Horror movie costume.
[04:48.400 --> 04:49.440]  That's Nick's kid.
[04:49.580 --> 04:52.020]  That's anyone dressed as Batman, although he's sick.
[04:52.200 --> 04:53.740]  Can it be anyone who's...
[04:53.740 --> 04:54.980]  Any vomit from...
[04:54.980 --> 04:55.860]  Hey, look at this.
[04:56.180 --> 04:56.340]  Spot.
[04:56.340 --> 04:56.920]  Look at this right here.
[04:58.000 --> 04:58.220]  Hey.
[04:59.780 --> 05:01.100]  Thumbs up for YouTube, buddy.
[05:01.200 --> 05:01.820]  Happy Halloween.
[05:02.860 --> 05:05.480]  My anchor in the center is eating candy on camera.
[05:05.640 --> 05:06.360]  People in dog costume.
[05:06.360 --> 05:07.020]  Oh, there's a group costume.
[05:07.540 --> 05:07.760]  Yep.
[05:07.960 --> 05:10.860]  Not a kicker picker, which is any athlete's costume.
[05:11.260 --> 05:14.620]  Pumpkin themed outfit and baby in costume.
[05:14.760 --> 05:16.460]  Halloween themed car.
[05:16.920 --> 05:17.400]  Yep.
[05:17.760 --> 05:19.840]  I think we're going to get a lot of these really fast.
[05:20.060 --> 05:20.700]  My nine.
[05:21.440 --> 05:23.820]  Two identical costumes in the same frame.
[05:24.440 --> 05:25.320]  Just ears.
[05:25.940 --> 05:27.800]  Cosplayer, which is a high quality costume.
[05:28.540 --> 05:29.560]  Halloween bouncer.
[05:30.320 --> 05:31.780]  Double fisting candy buckets.
[05:32.320 --> 05:33.120]  Penis costume.
[05:33.560 --> 05:35.880]  Party pooper, which is someone not dressed in costume.
[05:36.260 --> 05:36.940]  Who's that?
[05:37.320 --> 05:38.840]  Clearly a costume, but you can't tell what.
[05:39.840 --> 05:41.420]  And inflatable costume.
[05:42.220 --> 05:43.080]  Hey, it's ghosts.
[05:43.360 --> 05:43.420]  Yes.
[05:44.240 --> 05:45.080]  Be careful on that.
[05:45.140 --> 05:47.440]  They take you somewhere that can kill you if you touch the silver.
[05:48.040 --> 05:48.840]  You are doomed.
[05:50.100 --> 05:55.320]  Well, also, tonight, we have a quick emergency scene that we have set up.
[05:55.320 --> 05:56.340]  Do you guys want to see those?
[05:56.340 --> 05:56.840]  Oh, look at this.
[05:56.960 --> 05:57.480]  Oh, look at that.
[05:57.560 --> 05:58.300]  Before they got beat.
[05:58.460 --> 05:59.160]  Bingo cards.
[05:59.800 --> 05:59.980]  Wow.
[06:00.320 --> 06:00.680]  Yeah.
[06:00.820 --> 06:01.300]  Look at that.
[06:01.540 --> 06:02.240]  That's awesome.
[06:02.540 --> 06:04.060]  That's going to be immortalized.
[06:04.820 --> 06:06.700]  That's going to be immortalized.
[06:06.700 --> 06:09.400]  And we weren't even playing.
[06:11.220 --> 06:12.240]  Oh, no.
[06:13.380 --> 06:15.580]  That was such a Dan handshake.
[06:17.300 --> 06:18.340]  Oh, God.
[06:19.620 --> 06:22.080]  Why did I have that on my bingo card?
[06:22.500 --> 06:23.560]  Oh, my God.
[06:24.480 --> 06:25.580]  Oh, I'm going to throw up.
[06:25.940 --> 06:28.200]  That was the best start we've ever had.
[06:28.340 --> 06:29.100]  Oh, man.
[06:29.160 --> 06:30.600]  I can't wait for us to start.
[06:30.860 --> 06:31.140]  Oh, boy.
[06:31.140 --> 06:33.280]  Somebody post that on the subreddit now.
[06:33.400 --> 06:34.560]  I'm going to watch that forever.
[06:35.160 --> 06:35.500]  Yeah.
[06:35.820 --> 06:36.060]  Holy shit.
[06:36.060 --> 06:37.800]  That just became our new intro.
[06:38.120 --> 06:38.820]  Oh, man.
[06:38.920 --> 06:40.200]  Hey, Nick is right.
[06:40.280 --> 06:44.200]  Just in case anything goes sideways on Duvall Street, we have to cut away.
[06:44.320 --> 06:46.400]  Nick, show them what they'll see if something bad happens.
[06:47.020 --> 06:48.620]  We got this bad boy right here.
[06:48.900 --> 06:51.080]  We got these two little puppy dogs.
[06:51.200 --> 06:51.420]  Cute.
[06:51.560 --> 06:52.120]  Cute puppies.
[06:52.800 --> 06:53.540]  We got this.
[06:54.140 --> 06:54.620]  What is it?
[06:54.740 --> 06:54.900]  Excellent.
[06:55.240 --> 06:55.900]  The J card?
[06:56.100 --> 06:56.960]  Or what's it called, Gavin?
[06:57.360 --> 06:57.920]  Super J?
[06:59.340 --> 07:00.040]  What's it called?
[07:00.340 --> 07:01.020]  J card?
[07:01.300 --> 07:01.540]  Super J.
[07:01.900 --> 07:04.160]  What's the clown card?
[07:04.280 --> 07:04.420]  Super J.
[07:04.420 --> 07:05.840]  What's the clown card called?
[07:07.100 --> 07:07.620]  What?
[07:08.060 --> 07:08.620]  Test card J.
[07:08.920 --> 07:09.840]  Test card J.
[07:10.080 --> 07:10.680]  Test card J.
[07:10.700 --> 07:11.200]  Test card J.
[07:12.480 --> 07:13.420]  Super J.
[07:16.860 --> 07:17.800]  Super J.
[07:18.840 --> 07:21.380]  I think I started thinking of some pro wrestling stuff.
[07:21.680 --> 07:22.540]  I'm having a drink.
[07:22.680 --> 07:23.820]  I'm having a good time.
[07:24.360 --> 07:24.620]  Nice.
[07:25.020 --> 07:25.760]  Super J.
[07:26.240 --> 07:27.040]  And it's Donald Trump.
[07:28.360 --> 07:34.080]  I will also say, though, if you're watching this later on the VOD, or even now live and
[07:34.080 --> 07:38.400]  you want to see what you missed, we'll have the uncensored version available on Patreon
[07:38.400 --> 07:39.640]  for extra media members.
[07:39.640 --> 07:40.180]  That's right.
[07:41.100 --> 07:44.440]  So sign up for that Patreon at patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[07:44.540 --> 07:49.400]  That's where you support us directly, so that way we can keep doing this and we don't have
[07:49.400 --> 07:52.160]  to have meetings where we go, how are we going to keep doing this?
[07:52.320 --> 07:57.120]  And it could just be us doing this and going, dog in a costume or something like that.
[07:57.380 --> 07:57.740]  And start.
[07:58.180 --> 07:58.580]  No.
[07:58.800 --> 07:59.560]  It's 11 o'clock.
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.220]  Depending on the actions of the people of Key West, that version might be the exact same
[08:04.220 --> 08:05.020]  as this version.
[08:05.180 --> 08:05.460]  Yeah.
[08:05.660 --> 08:06.000]  Yep.
[08:06.100 --> 08:06.320]  Yeah.
[08:07.140 --> 08:08.760]  Andrew, why are you so anxious to get started?
[08:08.980 --> 08:09.620]  I hate.
[08:09.740 --> 08:12.240]  This is the least of all the bits we do.
[08:12.400 --> 08:13.760]  This is my least favorite bit.
[08:13.960 --> 08:14.900]  I just want to play.
[08:15.080 --> 08:16.200]  I just want to play the game.
[08:16.340 --> 08:17.180]  Let's just play the game.
[08:17.260 --> 08:17.860]  We're all here.
[08:17.960 --> 08:18.480]  We're live.
[08:18.600 --> 08:19.640]  Let's start playing the game.
[08:20.080 --> 08:23.440]  I just thought we had a whole time that we like figured out like I thought 1015 was like
[08:23.440 --> 08:23.820]  really good.
[08:23.840 --> 08:24.980]  It's like when the sloppiness starts.
[08:25.100 --> 08:26.960]  I mean, let's go live at 1015.
[08:27.680 --> 08:29.180]  Let's start at Sloppy Clock.
[08:29.180 --> 08:30.260]  Do you want to go offline?
[08:30.960 --> 08:32.240]  I mean, why would we start at 1015?
[08:32.240 --> 08:33.120]  That's crazy, man.
[08:33.320 --> 08:36.600]  Are you trying to reclaim some personal time right now?
[08:37.360 --> 08:38.640]  No, I just want to play.
[08:39.020 --> 08:39.640]  I'm excited.
[08:39.720 --> 08:40.940]  I'm so excited to play.
[08:42.060 --> 08:45.060]  Do you think that guy, would you consider that a tuxedo over there?
[08:45.260 --> 08:45.560]  No.
[08:46.720 --> 08:47.340]  Not quite.
[08:47.420 --> 08:47.720]  All right.
[08:47.780 --> 08:48.760]  I mean, it's up to you guys.
[08:48.880 --> 08:50.340]  Hey, it's there's five of us.
[08:50.640 --> 08:51.440]  Let's take a vote.
[08:51.600 --> 08:53.860]  Do you want to start playing right now or do you want to wait?
[08:54.460 --> 08:55.140]  Holy shit.
[08:55.240 --> 08:56.480]  Gifted subs left and right.
[08:56.560 --> 08:56.880]  Look at that.
[08:56.980 --> 08:58.440]  Oh, thank you so much.
[08:58.440 --> 08:59.140]  How long?
[08:59.560 --> 08:59.780]  How?
[09:00.200 --> 09:00.480]  And?
[09:01.060 --> 09:03.600]  So, we would be waiting seven minutes?
[09:04.400 --> 09:04.940]  Yeah, roughly.
[09:05.280 --> 09:05.520]  And RegulationRat.
[09:06.440 --> 09:06.680]  Yeah.
[09:06.900 --> 09:07.100]  What?
[09:08.660 --> 09:09.060]  What?
[09:09.340 --> 09:10.260]  Who's RegulationRat?
[09:10.700 --> 09:11.020]  I don't know.
[09:11.020 --> 09:11.800]  He gifted 10 subs.
[09:12.240 --> 09:13.000]  Oh, thank you, RegulationRat.
[09:13.000 --> 09:13.500]  Thanks, RegulationRat.
[09:13.560 --> 09:16.600]  Dude, that's a fucking regulation kind thing to do.
[09:17.060 --> 09:18.240]  Is that trouble on the horizon?
[09:18.380 --> 09:18.680]  Hold on.
[09:18.820 --> 09:19.220]  Oh, no.
[09:19.700 --> 09:20.740]  I don't think so.
[09:20.860 --> 09:21.440]  What does that mean?
[09:21.960 --> 09:22.500]  Where am I looking?
[09:22.580 --> 09:22.980]  Oh, okay.
[09:23.080 --> 09:23.500]  It's all right.
[09:23.540 --> 09:23.860]  It's okay.
[09:23.980 --> 09:25.900]  The people crossing in the crosswalk right now.
[09:26.760 --> 09:30.500]  Nick is like, this is going to be the only time he's watching like a hawk.
[09:30.940 --> 09:35.920]  Also, what we were talking about earlier is, like, when we were drafting these boards initially,
[09:36.820 --> 09:39.500]  our regular bingo board, we still have a regular bingo board.
[09:39.900 --> 09:40.140]  Yeah.
[09:40.260 --> 09:44.520]  But our boo board, we all have our individual things.
[09:44.720 --> 09:46.040]  Nick can't piggyback on anyone.
[09:47.120 --> 09:47.460]  That's true.
[09:47.780 --> 09:49.320]  I don't know what he's going to do for that.
[09:49.680 --> 09:51.140]  Yeah, he couldn't steal tonight.
[09:51.620 --> 09:51.920]  Yeah.
[09:52.520 --> 09:53.260]  Well, not yet.
[09:53.500 --> 09:53.860]  We'll see.
[09:54.080 --> 09:54.340]  Okay.
[09:54.340 --> 09:56.720]  I've got a couple of workarounds.
[09:56.800 --> 09:58.920]  What do you win if you win the boo board?
[10:00.280 --> 10:01.440]  Just like a bonus.
[10:01.620 --> 10:02.320]  It's a boo bonus.
[10:03.520 --> 10:04.100]  We can do a cupcake.
[10:04.320 --> 10:05.520]  We can do a smaller cake.
[10:06.040 --> 10:06.720]  Since it's a smaller board.
[10:06.720 --> 10:07.380]  I like that.
[10:07.600 --> 10:07.840]  Cupcake.
[10:08.340 --> 10:08.960]  Smaller cake.
[10:09.160 --> 10:10.480]  Gavin, are you okay with smaller cake?
[10:10.980 --> 10:12.020]  Love it.
[10:12.100 --> 10:12.520]  Absolutely.
[10:13.080 --> 10:14.540]  They're vibing in that car.
[10:15.660 --> 10:16.120]  Can we start?
[10:16.880 --> 10:18.200]  It's a party bus right there.
[10:18.280 --> 10:18.480]  Yep.
[10:19.960 --> 10:20.400]  Whoa!
[10:20.700 --> 10:20.960]  Look at that!
[10:21.540 --> 10:22.300]  Group costume!
[10:22.300 --> 10:22.900]  Group costume!
[10:22.900 --> 10:24.060]  Man, that would count.
[10:24.260 --> 10:24.900]  God damn.
[10:24.920 --> 10:25.620]  I have that.
[10:25.720 --> 10:28.020]  Dude, if we started, that would be so sick right now.
[10:28.340 --> 10:28.960]  You know what?
[10:29.040 --> 10:31.540]  I bet that would also count as can't sit down in.
[10:32.160 --> 10:32.880]  Yeah, probably.
[10:33.660 --> 10:34.280]  God damn.
[10:34.380 --> 10:35.340]  I'd be halfway done.
[10:36.240 --> 10:36.520]  Yep.
[10:37.400 --> 10:38.020]  What do you think?
[10:38.020 --> 10:38.460]  They're everywhere.
[10:39.120 --> 10:40.320]  Do you guys want to start now?
[10:41.060 --> 10:42.440]  No, it's not 7.15 yet.
[10:42.900 --> 10:43.840]  Yeah, why didn't you count us down?
[10:43.920 --> 10:44.500]  7.15?
[10:45.480 --> 10:46.480]  Yeah, it's my time.
[10:46.740 --> 10:47.720]  7.15, South Block.
[10:47.740 --> 10:48.340]  I'm in the Pacific.
[10:51.060 --> 10:51.960]  Gavin, they don't want to start.
[10:52.040 --> 10:52.480]  We have to wait.
[10:52.480 --> 10:54.100]  We have to wait five minutes, Gav.
[10:54.500 --> 10:56.500]  Hey, Gav, why don't you tell us a five minute story?
[10:58.700 --> 10:59.420]  Once a...
[10:59.420 --> 11:02.920]  Tell me, how about in five minutes, explain the link that was broken.
[11:03.020 --> 11:04.500]  You can take your time, you can do some research.
[11:05.120 --> 11:06.480]  Oh yeah, go take a look, Gav.
[11:06.600 --> 11:09.220]  Isn't it important that we notice what people are telling us, though?
[11:09.840 --> 11:11.400]  I think it wasn't for us.
[11:11.420 --> 11:12.480]  I think it was for the mods.
[11:13.500 --> 11:15.540]  The chat was talking only to the mods?
[11:16.020 --> 11:16.240]  Yeah.
[11:16.440 --> 11:19.060]  I'm assuming it was a link posted in the chat by someone.
[11:19.500 --> 11:20.560]  What the fuck is that?
[11:20.560 --> 11:22.800]  That's a costume that you don't know what it is.
[11:23.060 --> 11:23.860]  I have that.
[11:23.940 --> 11:24.720]  I have who's that.
[11:24.920 --> 11:25.240]  I know.
[11:25.440 --> 11:26.420]  The purple, whatever.
[11:26.740 --> 11:27.080]  Oh!
[11:27.400 --> 11:28.920]  He's wearing a crown on that lady.
[11:29.440 --> 11:29.960]  Is he?
[11:30.360 --> 11:31.040]  With shorts?
[11:31.200 --> 11:31.420]  Yeah.
[11:31.740 --> 11:31.900]  Yeah.
[11:32.180 --> 11:32.700]  Prince with shorts.
[11:32.720 --> 11:33.880]  And a baseball cap?
[11:35.380 --> 11:35.780]  It's...
[11:35.780 --> 11:37.280]  I think he's just wearing a purple suit.
[11:37.440 --> 11:38.780]  I think he is...
[11:39.020 --> 11:39.720]  Yeah, I don't know.
[11:40.260 --> 11:41.080]  I don't know what he is.
[11:41.200 --> 11:41.680]  Yeah, you're right.
[11:41.760 --> 11:42.280]  This is a great...
[11:42.280 --> 11:42.480]  Dude.
[11:42.540 --> 11:43.140]  What is that?
[11:43.500 --> 11:50.180]  When you go to the subreddit right now, the two newest posts are the guys doing the handshake.
[11:50.180 --> 11:51.560]  Are you serious?
[11:51.700 --> 11:54.400]  Can we make that our new intro instead of the Pew poll?
[11:58.280 --> 11:59.100]  Oh, man.
[11:59.140 --> 11:59.780]  This is so good.
[12:00.020 --> 12:00.960]  That's awesome.
[12:01.480 --> 12:02.160]  Oh, man.
[12:02.160 --> 12:02.420]  Oh, my God.
[12:02.820 --> 12:04.480]  It's just two friendly guys being friendly.
[12:04.980 --> 12:05.120]  Yeah.
[12:05.120 --> 12:06.260]  Yeah, it was pretty adorable.
[12:08.720 --> 12:10.600]  They were just so excited to participate.
[12:10.860 --> 12:11.140]  Oh!
[12:11.300 --> 12:11.700]  God damn it!
[12:11.820 --> 12:12.560]  Vlog holiday!
[12:12.700 --> 12:13.040]  Wait!
[12:13.180 --> 12:13.600]  Wait!
[12:13.680 --> 12:14.560]  For four minutes!
[12:15.340 --> 12:15.860]  Deliberate!
[12:16.220 --> 12:16.980]  Come back!
[12:17.160 --> 12:17.780]  Think about it.
[12:17.780 --> 12:18.340]  Come back!
[12:19.720 --> 12:20.600]  Come back!
[12:20.780 --> 12:21.940]  He only said yes.
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.920]  I'm honoring your rules!
[12:24.380 --> 12:24.820]  Andrew.
[12:25.860 --> 12:26.960]  He had a chance not to.
[12:27.100 --> 12:28.280]  That's tough for you, dude.
[12:28.420 --> 12:32.780]  This is like when you invented the wheel the other day and then regretted it.
[12:33.340 --> 12:33.560]  Yeah.
[12:34.140 --> 12:37.340]  Which, by the way, we didn't talk about in the podcast at all, but it's gonna come up
[12:37.340 --> 12:39.920]  and it's gonna hit like a fucking hammer at some point.
[12:40.100 --> 12:41.480]  I totally forgot until just this moment.
[12:43.020 --> 12:45.540]  Yeah, it's all I've been thinking about since this happened.
[12:45.720 --> 12:47.560]  The kicker picker has reignited.
[12:48.140 --> 12:51.920]  Go to third wheel and it's just like, oh no.
[12:52.300 --> 12:53.560]  Is that guy Bucky's?
[12:54.300 --> 12:55.340]  We'll find out next week.
[12:55.500 --> 12:56.800]  I think he just had a Bucky's shirt.
[12:56.960 --> 12:58.100]  I don't know if he was Bucky's.
[12:58.440 --> 13:04.680]  I hope everybody who's ever listened to Fuckface or Regulation or watched a gameplay watches
[13:04.680 --> 13:07.840]  that kicker picker re-picker when it comes out.
[13:09.060 --> 13:10.500]  It's so, it's insane.
[13:10.740 --> 13:11.800]  It's something.
[13:12.080 --> 13:12.640]  When's it come out?
[13:12.740 --> 13:13.700]  It's on the calendar already, right?
[13:13.720 --> 13:14.100]  Next week.
[13:14.320 --> 13:15.640]  I think it's next Friday, right?
[13:15.940 --> 13:17.540]  Yeah, I think it's Friday of next week.
[13:18.060 --> 13:20.340]  It is on the calendar for Friday of next week.
[13:20.780 --> 13:22.400]  That one, it got away from us.
[13:22.680 --> 13:24.020]  That one got away from us.
[13:24.140 --> 13:26.780]  That one changed the future a little bit.
[13:26.960 --> 13:27.140]  Yeah.
[13:27.320 --> 13:28.900]  But who's to blame?
[13:30.040 --> 13:31.180]  It's Andrew, clearly.
[13:32.020 --> 13:33.860]  It's definitely not just me.
[13:34.820 --> 13:36.100]  I brought up the thing.
[13:36.400 --> 13:37.620]  You didn't want to do the thing.
[13:37.720 --> 13:39.340]  I said, okay, we don't have to do the thing.
[13:39.620 --> 13:41.660]  Then all of a sudden two wheels were created.
[13:42.220 --> 13:43.000]  And I said, okay.
[13:43.640 --> 13:46.940]  And then you guys filled the wheel with mayhem.
[13:46.940 --> 13:49.420]  And then you said, Andrew, why did you do this?
[13:50.480 --> 13:52.040]  I mean, you introduced the idea.
[13:52.120 --> 13:53.600]  The concept was your fault.
[13:53.960 --> 13:54.700]  Oh, man.
[13:55.320 --> 13:57.980]  If I come up with the premise of a building,
[13:58.020 --> 14:00.560]  you can't blame me if someone else lights it on fire.
[14:00.700 --> 14:02.100]  Because I invented it to save.
[14:03.740 --> 14:05.780]  But if the building didn't exist,
[14:05.900 --> 14:06.680]  it couldn't have happened.
[14:06.800 --> 14:08.060]  So therefore, I can't blame you.
[14:08.580 --> 14:10.620]  Maybe just don't light the building on fire, Nick.
[14:10.640 --> 14:11.260]  What about that?
[14:11.800 --> 14:13.300]  Well, what if they were burning incense?
[14:14.460 --> 14:16.020]  Oh, that's a dangerous game.
[14:17.240 --> 14:20.520]  There's a lot of people who don't think incense will start fires.
[14:20.780 --> 14:23.340]  Yeah, I'm impressed with the audience.
[14:23.920 --> 14:25.000]  I'm very impressed with the audience.
[14:25.360 --> 14:28.660]  I have to say that, look, Andrew, if you were to start...
[14:28.660 --> 14:29.100]  God!
[14:29.980 --> 14:32.060]  Slow down! One minute!
[14:32.400 --> 14:34.700]  Slow down! Less than a minute!
[14:35.220 --> 14:36.360]  Come back!
[14:37.720 --> 14:37.980]  No!
[14:41.840 --> 14:43.760]  That echo was so funny.
[14:45.640 --> 14:46.360]  What'd she say?
[14:47.100 --> 14:48.600]  Did that guy have a slice of cake?
[14:49.340 --> 14:50.100]  Oh, cool.
[14:50.700 --> 14:52.360]  40 seconds to go.
[14:52.420 --> 14:53.620]  Oh, wow, we're almost there.
[14:54.200 --> 14:55.300]  Are you ready, Andrew?
[14:55.480 --> 14:56.540]  I'm not ready at all.
[14:56.540 --> 14:58.580]  We've been waiting for 15 minutes.
[14:59.240 --> 15:01.700]  Everyone, get your boards ready. Get your boo board.
[15:02.120 --> 15:05.520]  Are you guys more focused on your boo boards?
[15:05.820 --> 15:05.880]  Boo board.
[15:05.880 --> 15:08.040]  I'm 100% focused on the boo board right now.
[15:08.040 --> 15:09.520]  I'm so locked into boo boards, dude.
[15:09.980 --> 15:13.240]  Yeah, I'm definitely paying 60% attention to boo board.
[15:14.180 --> 15:16.020]  I'm up to like 80% on boo boards.
[15:16.900 --> 15:17.880]  Get out too late.
[15:18.220 --> 15:19.400]  That is get out too late.
[15:19.640 --> 15:21.460]  Put a fucking Santa hat on that kid.
[15:22.000 --> 15:22.700]  Do I have it?
[15:22.800 --> 15:26.120]  It starts in 5... 4... 3...
[15:26.600 --> 15:27.060]  Of course I don't have it.
[15:27.540 --> 15:29.800]  2... 1... Slop a clap!
[15:29.900 --> 15:31.000]  He's out of frame.
[15:31.460 --> 15:32.240]  Doesn't count.
[15:33.020 --> 15:34.040]  Party paper!
[15:36.820 --> 15:37.580]  Let's see.
[15:38.180 --> 15:39.000]  That guy's hoofing it.
[15:39.880 --> 15:40.400]  Damn.
[15:40.400 --> 15:41.720]  I do have hoofing it.
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.160]  I do not.
[15:44.260 --> 15:46.620]  She has a little hat. That's fun.
[15:46.740 --> 15:47.640]  Oh, that's cute.
[15:49.680 --> 15:50.400]  Gross Gavin.
[15:50.520 --> 15:51.440]  Jesus Christ.
[15:53.220 --> 15:54.980]  He has a pumpkin on his shirt.
[15:55.180 --> 15:56.220]  Is that a pumpkin themed outfit?
[15:59.730 --> 16:00.350]  Let's see.
[16:00.530 --> 16:02.190]  What do we got here?
[16:02.890 --> 16:03.730]  I don't even know where to start.
[16:03.730 --> 16:05.950]  Oh man, I have luxury car. No!
[16:08.250 --> 16:08.950]  Good luck.
[16:09.890 --> 16:10.630]  Oh, is that a machine?
[16:11.790 --> 16:13.690]  Oh, does anybody have dick grab?
[16:14.710 --> 16:15.010]  Nope.
[16:16.350 --> 16:17.670]  I got head sheen.
[16:18.050 --> 16:19.350]  Was that head sheen just then?
[16:19.850 --> 16:20.510]  Yeah, the bald guy?
[16:21.030 --> 16:22.890]  Yeah, that would definitely be head sheen.
[16:22.890 --> 16:23.530]  I don't have either of those.
[16:25.610 --> 16:26.270]  Sunglasses at night.
[16:26.310 --> 16:28.030]  Put them on your fucking eyeballs, lady.
[16:29.650 --> 16:31.430]  Oh man, I have high five on my board.
[16:31.750 --> 16:32.330]  Dickhead truck!
[16:33.570 --> 16:34.970]  Hey, you two dorks.
[16:35.030 --> 16:36.450]  Come back and do the high five again.
[16:36.590 --> 16:37.890]  I have handshake on my board.
[16:37.890 --> 16:38.670]  Dickhead truck.
[16:40.270 --> 16:43.110]  Does anybody have fucking cape?
[16:43.730 --> 16:44.350]  Is that a thing?
[16:45.410 --> 16:46.650]  Whoa, that guy's going.
[16:46.870 --> 16:48.370]  Oh, that is close to unfortunate.
[16:48.870 --> 16:50.050]  Can I do who's that for that?
[16:50.250 --> 16:51.770]  Yeah, I think you can.
[16:52.030 --> 16:52.790]  I think you can.
[16:54.130 --> 16:54.790]  It's someone.
[16:56.290 --> 16:58.130]  Is that Little Red Riding Hood?
[16:58.210 --> 16:59.550]  Is that who she's supposed to be?
[17:00.010 --> 17:00.710]  Kid out too late.
[17:02.630 --> 17:05.530]  Little Red Riding Hood and her Rastafarian boyfriend?
[17:05.890 --> 17:06.830]  There's an angel,
[17:06.830 --> 17:08.250]  but where's the devil?
[17:08.910 --> 17:09.590]  Oh, is that an athlete?
[17:09.970 --> 17:10.770]  Yes, it is.
[17:11.190 --> 17:12.090]  Oh shit, I got it.
[17:12.470 --> 17:14.690]  Is that a devil?
[17:14.950 --> 17:16.250]  What the fuck was that, lady?
[17:18.010 --> 17:19.810]  She was a devil or an Olympian?
[17:19.870 --> 17:20.570]  I couldn't tell.
[17:21.870 --> 17:22.630]  What's the difference?
[17:24.050 --> 17:25.050]  Horns, I guess.
[17:26.290 --> 17:28.430]  So did we go for kid out late on that kid there?
[17:28.750 --> 17:28.930]  No.
[17:29.770 --> 17:31.370]  I don't think he was young enough.
[17:33.350 --> 17:35.050]  What is that lady wearing?
[17:35.050 --> 17:36.310]  She's a lime?
[17:36.950 --> 17:38.330]  Free candy, dig deeper.
[17:38.450 --> 17:39.750]  Does anyone have offensive shirt?
[17:41.170 --> 17:41.990]  Group costume.
[17:42.370 --> 17:42.850]  Matching shirts.
[17:44.610 --> 17:46.570]  I was going to buy a car.
[17:46.830 --> 17:47.170]  No.
[17:48.630 --> 17:51.430]  Dude, I have dog and hog.
[17:51.570 --> 17:52.130]  Luxury car.
[17:52.990 --> 17:55.110]  That is definitely a luxury car.
[17:55.270 --> 17:56.210]  Hell yeah, luxury car.
[17:56.210 --> 17:58.510]  That was just ears and that's a luxury car.
[17:58.770 --> 18:01.590]  Guys, I just need two more for Bingo.
[18:02.170 --> 18:02.470]  Wow.
[18:02.470 --> 18:03.510]  Lidless.
[18:03.750 --> 18:07.110]  Dude, I have double fisting candy bucket
[18:07.110 --> 18:08.230]  as my center square.
[18:08.450 --> 18:09.290]  Cowboy hat.
[18:09.850 --> 18:10.710]  Cowboy hat.
[18:13.270 --> 18:13.750]  Cowboy hat.
[18:15.750 --> 18:16.690]  What's roll of
[18:16.690 --> 18:17.310]  rubbish again?
[18:18.270 --> 18:19.470]  The trash guy.
[18:20.050 --> 18:22.070]  Oh my god, that was... never mind.
[18:23.510 --> 18:24.030]  Corvette.
[18:24.970 --> 18:25.850]  That's some more head sheen.
[18:26.590 --> 18:27.490]  Yeah, piece of shit.
[18:28.750 --> 18:29.650]  Was that a G-Wagon?
[18:29.650 --> 18:31.070]  That is just ears.
[18:31.650 --> 18:33.150]  That was a G-Wagon, I believe.
[18:34.250 --> 18:35.290]  Is that a kid out too late?
[18:36.390 --> 18:36.630]  No.
[18:36.930 --> 18:38.530]  Oh, those are just...
[18:39.410 --> 18:40.870]  She's a rabbit.
[18:41.110 --> 18:42.090]  That's an Easter rabbit, right?
[18:43.470 --> 18:44.970]  I don't think that's an Easter rabbit.
[18:45.050 --> 18:45.930]  I think that's just a rabbit.
[18:46.670 --> 18:48.670]  Nobody just dresses as a rabbit.
[18:49.730 --> 18:51.790]  I've seen three people dressed as rabbits.
[18:52.230 --> 18:52.730]  Bugs Bunny.
[18:54.450 --> 18:55.470]  Is a skeleton
[18:55.470 --> 18:56.830]  an overdone costume?
[18:58.370 --> 18:58.850]  Yes.
[18:59.450 --> 19:01.310]  That's the first skeleton
[19:01.310 --> 19:01.990]  we've seen.
[19:02.750 --> 19:05.190]  I don't think it's overdone
[19:05.190 --> 19:05.830]  at all.
[19:05.970 --> 19:07.590]  Do I have that?
[19:10.750 --> 19:13.090]  So it has to be overdone tonight, specifically?
[19:13.630 --> 19:14.870]  Well, I think there has to be
[19:14.870 --> 19:16.470]  consensus of it being overdone.
[19:16.590 --> 19:17.990]  I don't think skeleton's overdone.
[19:18.490 --> 19:20.170]  Yeah, this is the first time we've seen it.
[19:20.770 --> 19:22.630]  Captain of the Titanic?
[19:22.830 --> 19:24.530]  Who's the U-Boat commander?
[19:25.670 --> 19:26.730]  Such a specific...
[19:26.730 --> 19:28.450]  That would be... walking up to that guy and be like,
[19:28.530 --> 19:30.210]  What are you supposed to be? The Captain of the Titanic?
[19:31.530 --> 19:32.790]  Bernard Shaw, specifically.
[19:35.290 --> 19:36.790]  What has this cheerleader
[19:36.790 --> 19:38.090]  across the street been doing?
[19:38.570 --> 19:40.890]  She's been standing there the whole fucking night.
[19:40.910 --> 19:41.770]  She's waiting for this person.
[19:43.170 --> 19:44.290]  Oh, she is.
[19:44.390 --> 19:46.370]  Got picked up.
[19:46.430 --> 19:46.910]  Oh, pick up.
[19:48.410 --> 19:48.930]  Chugging it.
[19:50.870 --> 19:51.830]  Was that Chug?
[19:51.830 --> 19:53.350]  It was. Oh yeah, big time.
[19:54.050 --> 19:54.410]  Damn.
[19:58.850 --> 19:59.930]  Skeleton's overdone costume!
[20:01.750 --> 20:02.990]  I might have to get closer.
[20:04.090 --> 20:05.450]  I might have to acquiesce.
[20:05.610 --> 20:06.870]  On the next one.
[20:06.890 --> 20:09.390]  I think it might be overdone, Gavin. You might be right.
[20:09.490 --> 20:10.010]  Dumb hat!
[20:11.310 --> 20:12.810]  A mixing bowl or something.
[20:15.750 --> 20:17.010]  Oh, I have dumb hat. Sweet.
[20:18.590 --> 20:19.610]  Yawning. Bachelorette party.
[20:19.610 --> 20:21.290]  Wheelchair. Anybody seen a wheelchair?
[20:21.590 --> 20:22.490]  Nighttime Shades. Never.
[20:23.270 --> 20:24.810]  One time.
[20:26.050 --> 20:26.830]  When Andrew didn't have a wheelchair.
[20:26.830 --> 20:27.330]  Formal attire.
[20:30.650 --> 20:31.370]  No.
[20:34.330 --> 20:36.070]  Cowboy hat again.
[20:37.050 --> 20:37.870]  Spider-Man!
[20:41.310 --> 20:43.330]  Was there a Spider-Man movie this summer?
[20:43.850 --> 20:45.570]  Practical costume, I'm upset.
[20:45.570 --> 20:48.930]  I think it's supposed to be Cyclops.
[20:48.990 --> 20:49.710]  I don't think it's Wolverine.
[20:51.110 --> 20:51.630]  Damn.
[20:52.190 --> 20:54.090]  I think he has red sunglasses on.
[20:54.650 --> 20:55.570]  Or it's Gambit.
[20:57.110 --> 20:57.410]  Yeah.
[20:57.830 --> 20:58.810]  Everybody loves Gambit.
[21:00.010 --> 21:01.970]  Walk down this way, costume people.
[21:03.970 --> 21:06.270]  There might be fishnets over there.
[21:06.530 --> 21:07.530]  I need you to come down.
[21:07.830 --> 21:08.370]  I can't see.
[21:09.430 --> 21:11.950]  I can't believe we haven't seen a penis costume yet.
[21:12.670 --> 21:14.930]  That is a Gambit costume, by the way.
[21:15.910 --> 21:16.990]  Oh, that is Gambit.
[21:17.150 --> 21:18.990]  I think there was a guy with him.
[21:19.210 --> 21:20.150]  Oh, I got that then.
[21:20.530 --> 21:21.630]  Summer movie representative.
[21:21.930 --> 21:23.790]  Damn, shit.
[21:27.730 --> 21:28.750]  Where's that Scooby-Doo guy?
[21:28.990 --> 21:30.090]  Is anybody a fan of the band Thrice?
[21:30.210 --> 21:31.190]  Because that guy just walked by.
[21:35.210 --> 21:36.370]  What the fuck?
[21:37.850 --> 21:38.910]  That's formal wear.
[21:39.270 --> 21:40.430]  That's not a tuxedo, though.
[21:40.470 --> 21:41.690]  God damn it, I wish it was.
[21:41.690 --> 21:42.730]  Is that a tuxedo?
[21:43.390 --> 21:45.610]  No, it was too long.
[21:45.650 --> 21:46.430]  Dead parrot head.
[21:46.670 --> 21:47.910]  It looks like a tuxedo with tails.
[21:48.650 --> 21:49.610]  Maybe it was.
[21:49.710 --> 21:51.170]  I think that counts, dude.
[21:51.230 --> 21:52.390]  That's a regulation costume.
[21:53.030 --> 21:57.210]  I got two identical costumes here on the top right.
[21:58.090 --> 21:59.670]  I need a hot dog costume badly.
[21:59.790 --> 22:01.090]  Are they the twins from The Shining?
[22:04.130 --> 22:04.570]  Pumpkin!
[22:05.350 --> 22:06.530]  That is a pumpkin.
[22:07.450 --> 22:08.670]  That's just the eyes.
[22:08.670 --> 22:09.610]  That's pumpkin.
[22:10.750 --> 22:12.570]  No, I gotta go with Gavin on this one.
[22:12.590 --> 22:13.310]  I don't think it is.
[22:13.450 --> 22:14.890]  I guess I've been outvoted.
[22:15.550 --> 22:17.350]  No, you weren't. There's two of them.
[22:17.770 --> 22:18.630]  Oh, we got dogs.
[22:19.070 --> 22:20.790]  Oh, there's a dog.
[22:21.050 --> 22:23.690]  I need a motorcycle.
[22:24.010 --> 22:24.930]  I'm coming to frame.
[22:25.730 --> 22:27.010]  I got dog out too late.
[22:29.490 --> 22:29.930]  Motorcycle!
[22:30.970 --> 22:32.470]  Hey, we counted that as formal attire.
[22:32.510 --> 22:33.530]  Is that dog wearing a costume?
[22:34.070 --> 22:35.950]  No, I think it's just dogs.
[22:35.950 --> 22:38.110]  I just need a dead parrot head and I win.
[22:38.530 --> 22:39.010]  Wow.
[22:39.590 --> 22:40.070]  Already?
[22:43.230 --> 22:43.710]  Dogs.
[22:43.830 --> 22:44.310]  Motorcycle.
[22:44.870 --> 22:48.190]  Put those dogs in a fucking pair of bat wings or something, you asshole.
[22:48.630 --> 22:49.390]  Come back!
[22:50.030 --> 22:52.190]  How are none of those people Wolverine?
[22:53.730 --> 22:55.430]  Oh, is that a bachelorette party?
[22:56.430 --> 22:57.630]  There's Deadpool, damn it.
[22:57.750 --> 22:59.270]  That's gotta be a bachelorette party, right?
[22:59.950 --> 23:00.750]  I don't think so.
[23:01.070 --> 23:01.170]  Where?
[23:01.170 --> 23:04.110]  Those two ladies that had the pink clothes and the bow and stuff?
[23:04.290 --> 23:05.410]  Those were costumes.
[23:06.230 --> 23:07.630]  Those were bachelorette costumes.
[23:10.030 --> 23:10.910]  Bachelorette costumes?
[23:11.910 --> 23:12.990]  I mean, that's what they were dressed in.
[23:12.990 --> 23:15.150]  They were dressed the same way as every bachelorette party.
[23:15.790 --> 23:17.590]  Oh, see, he's supposed to be Iron Man.
[23:17.730 --> 23:18.530]  See, another skeleton.
[23:18.890 --> 23:20.330]  Yeah, overdone.
[23:20.530 --> 23:23.350]  He built that costume in a cave with parts.
[23:23.790 --> 23:24.130]  And scraps.
[23:28.650 --> 23:29.490]  Eat some candy.
[23:29.610 --> 23:30.930]  Now, Spider-Man is a video game.
[23:30.970 --> 23:32.210]  Does that count as a video game costume?
[23:33.530 --> 23:33.870]  Yes.
[23:34.330 --> 23:35.410]  I would say so.
[23:36.670 --> 23:37.630]  I'll give it to you, yeah.
[23:37.690 --> 23:40.770]  Oh my god, that lady was just air humping.
[23:42.610 --> 23:43.370]  Is that dancing?
[23:44.090 --> 23:46.430]  Yeah, I think he could...
[23:46.430 --> 23:47.410]  See, Nick doesn't...
[23:47.410 --> 23:49.370]  See, this is when we're on the main card stuff
[23:49.370 --> 23:50.930]  where Nick doesn't see it, but he'll take it.
[23:50.930 --> 23:52.950]  No, but I'm saying, does that count?
[23:53.550 --> 23:54.710]  I don't have it, I'm just asking.
[23:57.350 --> 23:58.670]  Gambit dropped one of his cards.
[23:58.810 --> 23:59.510]  Is he a litter bug?
[24:01.670 --> 24:02.510]  That'd be a yes.
[24:03.850 --> 24:05.530]  Oh man, what do I need?
[24:07.870 --> 24:09.050]  He looks like
[24:09.050 --> 24:10.910]  Joey Graceffa dressing as Gambit.
[24:11.650 --> 24:12.170]  Yeah, kinda.
[24:12.770 --> 24:13.630]  Witch without a broom!
[24:17.090 --> 24:18.410]  And fake doctor!
[24:19.830 --> 24:20.310]  What?
[24:20.530 --> 24:20.970]  Oh yeah.
[24:23.270 --> 24:24.570]  I'm a peanut butter jar
[24:24.570 --> 24:25.330]  away from a win!
[24:26.010 --> 24:26.650]  Oh, cool!
[24:27.990 --> 24:29.410]  Holding hands, is that one?
[24:30.010 --> 24:31.830]  Oh, good call.
[24:31.990 --> 24:33.150]  I don't know.
[24:33.950 --> 24:36.010]  What if some dude just walking by is drunk
[24:36.010 --> 24:38.310]  and just spooning out peanut butter
[24:38.310 --> 24:40.450]  to keep himself going?
[24:41.670 --> 24:42.750]  Think those are wigs?
[24:43.090 --> 24:44.010]  That's not fast.
[24:44.010 --> 24:44.410]  What is this?
[24:46.010 --> 24:47.470]  Oh, is this a pirate?
[24:47.970 --> 24:49.250]  Is that a real life dead guy?
[24:51.070 --> 24:51.550]  No.
[24:53.330 --> 24:54.130]  Oh, it's Woody.
[24:57.880 --> 24:59.560]  I need a scream mask,
[24:59.700 --> 25:01.000]  I need fake blood.
[25:01.900 --> 25:03.380]  I'm not sure that lady was a real nun.
[25:05.960 --> 25:07.280]  Dude, I need a lot of things.
[25:07.620 --> 25:09.760]  I have Halloween bouncer.
[25:10.680 --> 25:12.140]  I gotta get Halloween bouncer.
[25:14.340 --> 25:14.660]  Oh,
[25:15.700 --> 25:16.020]  Jesus.
[25:17.860 --> 25:18.500]  Drive-by
[25:19.560 --> 25:19.880]  Halloween
[25:20.540 --> 25:21.980]  car thing, somebody has that.
[25:22.380 --> 25:23.380]  Oh, that was Elvis, was it?
[25:24.660 --> 25:25.800]  Elvis in the back of that car?
[25:26.140 --> 25:26.900]  I didn't see it.
[25:27.360 --> 25:30.000]  In the back of the thing that's just good off-screen, that's Elvis, was it?
[25:30.140 --> 25:31.940]  I didn't see it.
[25:31.960 --> 25:33.320]  That's a real life dead guy if that's Elvis.
[25:34.140 --> 25:34.580]  That's true.
[25:35.060 --> 25:36.300]  Did anyone else see it?
[25:36.380 --> 25:37.220]  That's true, I didn't see it though.
[25:37.220 --> 25:38.980]  That's a pumpkin shirt, that's a pumpkin outfit.
[25:39.240 --> 25:40.700]  I didn't see jeans and flip-flops though.
[25:40.900 --> 25:43.120]  It was Elvis.
[25:44.100 --> 25:45.360]  Well, you can't use the chat
[25:45.360 --> 25:45.940]  to verify.
[25:47.340 --> 25:48.820]  Because it's a bunch of people going,
[25:48.900 --> 25:50.040]  oh my god, Gavin, talk to me.
[25:50.700 --> 25:51.800]  They said, oh my god, Gavin.
[25:52.760 --> 25:54.600]  They definitely have a point there, Gavin.
[25:57.180 --> 25:59.380]  Gavin, if I saw Elvis, I would say it's Elvis.
[25:59.880 --> 26:01.120]  I was looking at him,
[26:01.160 --> 26:01.900]  but I got outvoted.
[26:03.080 --> 26:05.520]  Gavin, you sound like people every day.
[26:05.520 --> 26:06.440]  I saw Elvis.
[26:08.960 --> 26:10.720]  Oh, a text has come in.
[26:11.260 --> 26:12.420]  A text from Jack Pattillo.
[26:12.800 --> 26:13.820]  He says it was Elvis.
[26:14.800 --> 26:15.400]  That's too bad.
[26:16.540 --> 26:17.860]  He sent you a clip of it.
[26:18.040 --> 26:20.280]  We all know that guy's got an agenda.
[26:20.980 --> 26:22.640]  If somebody clipped Elvis,
[26:23.560 --> 26:25.320]  I'm willing to reverse the decision,
[26:25.440 --> 26:26.380]  but I didn't see it.
[26:26.900 --> 26:28.200]  Honestly, he's just like the chat.
[26:29.060 --> 26:30.620]  Jack's just like the chat going, oh my god,
[26:30.720 --> 26:31.960]  Gavin, talk to me.
[26:32.380 --> 26:32.780]  No.
[26:34.360 --> 26:35.620]  I'm not going to reverse it,
[26:35.720 --> 26:37.980]  because there's too many deep fakes of Elvis anyway.
[26:40.760 --> 26:42.120]  Maybe Elvis will come back
[26:42.120 --> 26:43.420]  around with Santa as well.
[26:44.240 --> 26:45.680]  Cross my card, motherfuckers.
[26:45.700 --> 26:46.320]  Let's do it.
[26:47.920 --> 26:48.660]  Be afraid.
[26:50.220 --> 26:50.860]  What else do I have?
[26:51.320 --> 26:52.540]  Ooh, a kid out late.
[26:53.120 --> 26:55.840]  That is definitely a kid out too late across the street there, Geoff.
[26:56.300 --> 26:57.820]  Oh my god, it's a little...
[26:57.820 --> 26:59.120]  Oh my god, it's a little toddler.
[26:59.120 --> 27:00.900]  That is way out late for a kid.
[27:01.040 --> 27:03.080]  That is a kid way out too late.
[27:03.220 --> 27:05.480]  Is that kid in a costume? He has a cowboy hat on!
[27:05.740 --> 27:06.300]  Yes, it's a costume!
[27:06.600 --> 27:06.840]  Yeah, he does.
[27:07.080 --> 27:11.260]  That worked out for me.
[27:11.500 --> 27:11.960]  Oh, skateboard!
[27:13.220 --> 27:13.940]  Yeah, skateboard.
[27:14.500 --> 27:17.480]  That might be the first skateboard I've ever seen.
[27:17.840 --> 27:19.520]  Can I mark the Tony Stark costume
[27:19.520 --> 27:20.680]  as celebrity lookalike?
[27:22.560 --> 27:23.640]  What about Spider-Man?
[27:24.680 --> 27:25.900]  There's a group costume.
[27:26.820 --> 27:27.080]  What?
[27:29.400 --> 27:29.760]  Uh...
[27:30.240 --> 27:31.160]  Oh, I've not even been
[27:31.160 --> 27:32.760]  looking for costumed background.
[27:33.020 --> 27:33.980]  Oh, there's a cone!
[27:35.100 --> 27:37.300]  Oh, I got it! If I can use the cone, I got it!
[27:37.900 --> 27:38.400]  For what?
[27:39.200 --> 27:41.140]  Group costume, can't sit down,
[27:41.260 --> 27:43.000]  impractical, awkward costume, Spider-Man.
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.500]  I think they can easily sit down.
[27:44.780 --> 27:45.560]  What are you talking about?
[27:46.540 --> 27:48.720]  Earlier, you guys said that you would have counted it.
[27:48.900 --> 27:49.440]  No, we didn't.
[27:49.620 --> 27:52.860]  No, Nick's right.
[27:53.780 --> 27:55.000]  Shut up, you don't even know.
[27:57.140 --> 27:58.700]  Nick rolled the finger at the link.
[27:58.880 --> 27:59.600]  Is this Elvis again?
[28:00.200 --> 28:00.620]  Is it Elvis?
[28:01.100 --> 28:01.320]  Where?
[28:02.860 --> 28:04.780]  You can't tell from here.
[28:04.920 --> 28:05.600]  I can't tell who that is.
[28:07.980 --> 28:09.180]  It's too small.
[28:09.860 --> 28:12.000]  Gavin, maybe if this was 1080,
[28:12.220 --> 28:13.000]  but this is only 720p.
[28:13.920 --> 28:14.440]  I'm sorry.
[28:15.780 --> 28:17.460]  Elvis just looping
[28:17.460 --> 28:19.480]  in the distance over and over again
[28:19.480 --> 28:20.140]  all night.
[28:21.080 --> 28:23.360]  But never going past the camera again.
[28:27.080 --> 28:28.380]  And you keep asking me
[28:28.380 --> 28:29.040]  where Elvis is.
[28:29.120 --> 28:31.000]  He's in the same spot every time you ask me.
[28:31.020 --> 28:32.320]  Oh, there's an angel.
[28:33.400 --> 28:33.920]  Oh.
[28:34.920 --> 28:36.020]  Where's the devil?
[28:37.620 --> 28:38.960]  Is that a devil?
[28:39.240 --> 28:39.960]  That's Goofy.
[28:41.120 --> 28:43.000]  That's Max. That's Goofy's son.
[28:43.200 --> 28:43.480]  Instrument.
[28:44.840 --> 28:46.220]  That's Max, Goofy's kid.
[28:47.220 --> 28:48.400]  There's a little dinosaur.
[28:48.960 --> 28:49.140]  Yeah.
[28:51.140 --> 28:52.080]  Little dino.
[28:52.080 --> 28:52.180]  Dino.
[28:57.780 --> 28:59.040]  Wait, he dropped something.
[28:59.240 --> 29:00.740]  Is Goofy a dog?
[29:01.240 --> 29:01.460]  Yeah.
[29:02.780 --> 29:04.820]  So that's people in a dog costume.
[29:04.840 --> 29:05.500]  Oh, get real.
[29:05.860 --> 29:08.980]  Would you say that dude's hot?
[29:09.200 --> 29:10.520]  Would you say it's a hot dog costume?
[29:11.420 --> 29:13.120]  I will if it gets me the point.
[29:13.140 --> 29:13.820]  He's kind of sexy.
[29:14.420 --> 29:15.380]  There's Spider-Man again.
[29:15.980 --> 29:17.940]  Are you fishing for me to say that guy's hot?
[29:18.980 --> 29:20.920]  If he does, I'll fucking win.
[29:22.560 --> 29:23.000]  Oh.
[29:23.560 --> 29:24.000]  What?
[29:24.580 --> 29:26.560]  Put your mask on, Peter Parker.
[29:26.740 --> 29:27.720]  Jesus Christ.
[29:28.020 --> 29:29.120]  Everyone can see it's you.
[29:30.860 --> 29:32.180]  That's how the third movie happened.
[29:33.040 --> 29:34.620]  Is this guy supposed to be a devil?
[29:35.040 --> 29:35.800]  Yeah, he's got a tail.
[29:36.700 --> 29:39.440]  So all you have to do is keep your eyes peeled for an angel.
[29:40.100 --> 29:41.220]  The angel just left.
[29:41.440 --> 29:42.140]  Cycle back in.
[29:42.740 --> 29:44.380]  Goddamn, the angel just went inside.
[29:45.560 --> 29:46.660]  I think there's another devil
[29:46.660 --> 29:47.660]  in the back there with the horns.
[29:49.180 --> 29:50.700]  Oh, yeah.
[29:50.820 --> 29:51.760]  In the t-shirt.
[29:52.360 --> 29:53.380]  Or I guess in the button-up shirt.
[29:53.600 --> 29:54.240]  Oh, yeah.
[29:56.140 --> 29:56.620]  Devil.
[29:57.420 --> 29:59.720]  Lady, come on. Step back.
[29:59.840 --> 30:00.160]  Whoa.
[30:01.600 --> 30:03.060]  Is that person cosplaying
[30:03.660 --> 30:04.420]  the other guy?
[30:05.020 --> 30:05.920]  I think they're Pitbull.
[30:07.480 --> 30:09.140]  I think they're all Pitbull.
[30:09.760 --> 30:11.080]  Yeah, it's a bunch of Pitbulls.
[30:11.440 --> 30:13.760]  This bouncer is bouncing right now
[30:13.760 --> 30:14.720]  with this fucking ID.
[30:15.800 --> 30:16.200]  Tricycle.
[30:17.080 --> 30:18.760]  Andrew, if you're marking celebrity look-alikes,
[30:18.900 --> 30:19.560]  so am I. You're crazy.
[30:20.420 --> 30:21.660]  Pitbull isn't a celebrity?
[30:23.680 --> 30:24.860]  They're dressed to look
[30:24.860 --> 30:25.360]  like him.
[30:26.640 --> 30:28.280]  Yeah, I mean, he's kind of got a point.
[30:28.660 --> 30:30.080]  That's an overdone skeleton costume.
[30:30.160 --> 30:30.980]  Look, skeleton again.
[30:32.320 --> 30:34.720]  I'm eating crow on that one. I'll admit it.
[30:36.120 --> 30:36.760]  This guy's
[30:36.760 --> 30:37.520]  dressed as security.
[30:39.620 --> 30:40.780]  Does that mean he's a Halloween
[30:40.780 --> 30:41.200]  bouncer?
[30:42.260 --> 30:42.900]  No.
[30:46.300 --> 30:46.700]  Just checking.
[30:49.280 --> 30:50.780]  Listen, it's important to ask.
[30:51.000 --> 30:51.400]  Absolutely.
[30:53.460 --> 30:54.680]  What's happening here?
[30:55.940 --> 30:57.660]  Oh, is that Elvis across the street?
[30:58.340 --> 30:58.780]  Where?
[30:59.300 --> 31:00.640]  I don't see anything.
[31:01.220 --> 31:02.760]  What, the guy in white?
[31:03.060 --> 31:03.900]  You can't tell anything.
[31:04.240 --> 31:05.900]  What are you talking about?
[31:08.100 --> 31:09.380]  You keep
[31:09.380 --> 31:10.600]  not telling us
[31:12.560 --> 31:14.060]  where he is.
[31:18.460 --> 31:19.280]  Where's Elvis?
[31:19.540 --> 31:21.360]  I think it was the same
[31:21.360 --> 31:23.040]  Elvis from the back of the car earlier.
[31:24.020 --> 31:25.580]  Is that kind of a wheelchair?
[31:26.660 --> 31:27.040]  No.
[31:28.180 --> 31:28.900]  Motorized scooter?
[31:29.280 --> 31:31.160]  Yeah, it's just a scooter, I'm afraid.
[31:31.660 --> 31:32.980]  Sorry, Geoff. Thanks.
[31:37.080 --> 31:37.980]  Son of a bitch.
[31:40.000 --> 31:41.580]  So Max is a dog, right?
[31:43.680 --> 31:44.840]  You're not getting
[31:44.840 --> 31:47.000]  dressed as a dog costume, whatever.
[31:47.600 --> 31:49.300]  Unless somebody walks by and goes
[31:49.300 --> 31:51.380]  God damn, that goofy is hot.
[31:58.040 --> 32:00.300]  I'm so excited to not see Elvis again.
[32:01.600 --> 32:01.900]  We'll see.
[32:02.040 --> 32:02.260]  I know.
[32:04.200 --> 32:05.600]  That was a Mr. Potato Head over there.
[32:05.600 --> 32:07.740]  That's where the Elvis was, by the way.
[32:10.400 --> 32:14.220]  That's where I'll look next time you yell about him.
[32:15.920 --> 32:18.260]  I think it's a dog costume, Nick.
[32:19.440 --> 32:20.460]  I'm on your side on that one.
[32:21.220 --> 32:21.960]  Is he costumed?
[32:24.660 --> 32:25.460]  Rick Rubin.
[32:28.900 --> 32:31.260]  Man, there are fireworks going off outside my house.
[32:31.780 --> 32:32.320]  Oh, really?
[32:33.200 --> 32:34.860]  For Halloween fireworks?
[32:34.860 --> 32:36.540]  I guess so.
[32:41.090 --> 32:42.930]  Shocked by the lack of peanut butter so far.
[32:43.390 --> 32:44.290]  Who are these people
[32:44.290 --> 32:45.190]  supposed to be?
[32:45.610 --> 32:47.750]  Oh, they're from the...
[32:48.870 --> 32:50.510]  It's the Bandits.
[32:51.150 --> 32:52.090]  That's amazing.
[32:52.570 --> 32:53.370]  That's really green.
[32:53.610 --> 32:54.750]  That's a pretty good one.
[32:55.590 --> 32:57.530]  The bold head through the beanie is great.
[32:57.890 --> 32:59.790]  That's really good. That's a great costume.
[33:00.910 --> 33:01.950]  Good on you guys.
[33:07.000 --> 33:08.040]  Why isn't
[33:08.040 --> 33:09.320]  anybody a hot date?
[33:10.440 --> 33:10.480]  Oh!
[33:11.720 --> 33:12.840]  Oh, it's close.
[33:13.140 --> 33:14.620]  It's an angel.
[33:14.840 --> 33:16.180]  Is that lady a devil?
[33:16.680 --> 33:18.000]  Is that a devil?
[33:20.020 --> 33:21.200]  She's got a devil tail!
[33:21.260 --> 33:21.980]  Yeah, that's a devil.
[33:22.860 --> 33:24.340]  You've got angel devil Geoff.
[33:24.600 --> 33:26.080]  I still don't have it.
[33:26.260 --> 33:26.760]  God damn.
[33:28.860 --> 33:30.200]  Where are the Wolverines?
[33:31.260 --> 33:31.960]  Where's Deadpool?
[33:32.540 --> 33:34.300]  Where are all the penises?
[33:36.600 --> 33:38.080]  Where are the impractical
[33:38.080 --> 33:38.540]  costumes?
[33:39.540 --> 33:41.060]  Where are the impractical jokers?
[33:42.680 --> 33:43.560]  I think they moved up.
[33:44.340 --> 33:45.400]  What? Well, one of them left.
[33:45.680 --> 33:47.100]  No, just one left. Is that real?
[33:47.520 --> 33:49.580]  Yeah, he left a couple seasons ago.
[33:53.040 --> 33:54.120]  It's just not the same,
[33:54.200 --> 33:55.900]  you know? He needed the realness.
[33:56.800 --> 33:57.960]  Oh, I think he was having...
[33:58.800 --> 33:59.740]  It got too corporate.
[33:59.740 --> 34:01.700]  I think he was having marital issues.
[34:01.700 --> 34:03.880]  We didn't sell Haunter
[34:03.880 --> 34:05.660]  to Network 1. That is a dog.
[34:06.280 --> 34:07.560]  We didn't sell Haunter
[34:07.560 --> 34:09.560]  to their network because they thought
[34:09.560 --> 34:11.520]  we were just another impractical jokers.
[34:11.820 --> 34:12.480]  They already had them.
[34:13.100 --> 34:14.260]  You wouldn't want to have
[34:15.420 --> 34:17.560]  too many wildly successful shows.
[34:18.020 --> 34:19.340]  Yeah. They're like,
[34:19.420 --> 34:21.620]  we've already got the impractical jokers. We feel like this is covered.
[34:22.220 --> 34:23.680]  Yeah, we got impractical jokers
[34:23.680 --> 34:25.520]  and it makes us a ton of money. We wouldn't want to
[34:25.520 --> 34:27.840]  replicate or duplicate that in any way, shape, or form.
[34:27.840 --> 34:29.880]  Is that a wheelchair being pushed
[34:29.880 --> 34:31.880]  across the street there? Yes, it is.
[34:31.880 --> 34:33.080]  It's a stroller.
[34:34.800 --> 34:36.560]  It's a chair with wheels on it.
[34:36.560 --> 34:37.460]  What are you doing?
[34:37.460 --> 34:40.020]  The fact that you thought that was a wheelchair
[34:40.020 --> 34:41.970]  ruins all your Elvis credibility.
[34:42.720 --> 34:43.910]  It's the same distance.
[34:44.740 --> 34:46.140]  The wheelchair thing was a joke.
[34:46.240 --> 34:47.440]  Elvis was actually there.
[34:48.520 --> 34:50.080]  Hey, that guy's digging in the trash can.
[34:50.140 --> 34:51.760]  Does anybody have a guy digging in a trash can?
[34:52.360 --> 34:53.820]  Now he's drinking it.
[34:54.180 --> 34:55.940]  I would say, Nick, if you were looking for a
[34:55.940 --> 34:57.880]  dead head... I got a dead
[34:57.880 --> 34:58.520]  parrot head.
[35:00.020 --> 35:01.340]  Is that a dead parrot head?
[35:01.640 --> 35:02.080]  Bingo.
[35:02.640 --> 35:04.260]  Hey, Nick,
[35:04.580 --> 35:07.860]  do you feel like you've been watching this
[35:07.860 --> 35:09.780]  kid who's like Max from Goofy for
[35:09.780 --> 35:10.620]  a really long time?
[35:11.800 --> 35:13.200]  No, why? I'm just curious.
[35:13.480 --> 35:15.940]  It feels like he's been tempting you the whole time
[35:15.940 --> 35:17.900]  because you've asked three times to see if he's a dog.
[35:18.500 --> 35:20.060]  When my eyes
[35:20.060 --> 35:21.500]  wander back to him, I wonder.
[35:22.640 --> 35:24.000]  Do you feel like he's just been there
[35:24.000 --> 35:24.480]  for too long?
[35:24.640 --> 35:27.840]  I had to repress my inner Nick when the Home Alone characters
[35:27.840 --> 35:29.800]  walked by saying that that was not a holiday
[35:29.800 --> 35:31.920]  outfit. I really wanted to.
[35:32.800 --> 35:33.600]  That's interesting.
[35:34.500 --> 35:35.520]  It's a Christmas movie.
[35:36.160 --> 35:38.040]  Yeah. So you got a bingo,
[35:38.180 --> 35:40.240]  right, Nick? I got a bingo on the main card.
[35:40.240 --> 35:41.740]  So we'll go for blackout on the bingo card
[35:41.740 --> 35:42.700]  while we're still trying to get a boo.
[35:42.960 --> 35:45.640]  I was one away. I was camera over
[35:45.640 --> 35:46.320]  staying away.
[35:48.780 --> 35:50.220]  That's the second time they've walked by.
[35:50.860 --> 35:51.940]  So Goofy is not
[35:51.940 --> 35:53.060]  overstaying on camera.
[35:54.400 --> 35:55.680]  You don't think so?
[35:57.180 --> 35:58.080]  That's what I was trying
[35:58.080 --> 35:59.500]  to squeeze out of Nick for him to say.
[35:59.620 --> 36:01.760]  Yeah, I want him out of here. And he didn't say it.
[36:01.900 --> 36:03.720]  Oh, he's smoking a cigarette.
[36:03.840 --> 36:04.140]  That's cool.
[36:06.500 --> 36:08.120]  He's got a couple minutes.
[36:11.220 --> 36:12.000]  Shocked by the
[36:12.000 --> 36:13.220]  lack of fishnets
[36:14.140 --> 36:15.200]  and fake blood.
[36:15.380 --> 36:17.760]  I'm shocked by the lack of body paint costumes.
[36:18.340 --> 36:19.720]  Yeah, I definitely
[36:19.720 --> 36:21.540]  this is not the way I anticipated
[36:21.540 --> 36:22.920]  this going tonight, for sure.
[36:25.260 --> 36:27.380]  On the one hand, I'm a little glad
[36:27.380 --> 36:29.540]  because I've got my finger sitting
[36:29.540 --> 36:30.400]  on this button.
[36:31.040 --> 36:33.140]  You had it ready to go. Smart.
[36:35.380 --> 36:37.060]  Is that the fastest bingo?
[36:37.480 --> 36:38.880]  Almost certainly offensive.
[36:39.560 --> 36:41.780]  Is that the fastest bingo we've ever had?
[36:42.300 --> 36:43.000]  It was pretty quick.
[36:43.520 --> 36:44.600]  We've been humming along.
[36:45.120 --> 36:46.540]  It's like 15-20 minutes for that?
[36:47.360 --> 36:47.880]  Wow.
[36:49.000 --> 36:50.180]  I think so, then.
[36:51.880 --> 36:53.960]  And it'll never happen again for me.
[36:57.380 --> 36:59.000]  That cape blowing in the wind
[36:59.000 --> 36:59.920]  across the street is very cool.
[36:59.940 --> 37:01.680]  Is that Ruby? Yeah, it did.
[37:02.100 --> 37:04.340]  Where? It's the Queen of Hearts.
[37:06.420 --> 37:07.800]  Very similar characters.
[37:10.060 --> 37:11.380]  It does look kind of like it.
[37:12.020 --> 37:13.440]  It did, actually, from far away.
[37:13.440 --> 37:14.400]  I'm not crazy.
[37:14.660 --> 37:15.800]  No, you're not crazy.
[37:15.920 --> 37:18.480]  It looked like it from far away.
[37:18.660 --> 37:19.340]  Like that guy was Elvis.
[37:19.860 --> 37:21.520]  I just love Ruby screaming,
[37:21.580 --> 37:24.140]  But that guy was Elvis.
[37:25.480 --> 37:26.540]  You get a clip of it?
[37:27.800 --> 37:29.160]  I don't know how to do that.
[37:30.260 --> 37:31.220]  Oh, that's a shame.
[37:31.600 --> 37:33.720]  Oh, damn, he left.
[37:34.440 --> 37:35.980]  Did you figure out how to fix the link situation?
[37:36.000 --> 37:36.340]  It's Elvis!
[37:36.720 --> 37:37.120]  Where?
[37:39.460 --> 37:40.200]  It is Elvis!
[37:40.200 --> 37:41.820]  Okay, that's Elvis.
[37:42.060 --> 37:42.880]  It's Elvis!
[37:44.460 --> 37:45.400]  That's Elvis.
[37:45.680 --> 37:47.580]  It's the same one, too, I think.
[37:48.680 --> 37:50.240]  And celebrity lookalike, I assume.
[37:51.200 --> 37:51.840]  Yeah, that counts.
[37:55.220 --> 37:55.780]  Finally.
[37:57.160 --> 37:58.180]  Oh, American flag clothes.
[37:58.220 --> 37:59.420]  Just saw those. That's good.
[38:07.630 --> 38:09.590]  Hugh Hefner timely costume.
[38:12.050 --> 38:13.430]  That's a real life dead guy.
[38:13.430 --> 38:15.430]  It is, yeah.
[38:15.450 --> 38:17.530]  That is a great real life dead guy.
[38:18.510 --> 38:20.050]  This is fucking Zorro.
[38:20.650 --> 38:21.750]  Lady, we already got a devil.
[38:21.810 --> 38:22.350]  We don't need you.
[38:23.630 --> 38:24.570]  Yeah, get out of here.
[38:25.870 --> 38:26.670]  Oh, it's Dan.
[38:27.030 --> 38:27.750]  Oh, there's Dan again.
[38:27.930 --> 38:30.730]  Andrew, there's your face.
[38:30.950 --> 38:32.670]  That counts.
[38:33.670 --> 38:34.850]  Have some peanut butter.
[38:36.030 --> 38:36.870]  Bingo cards.
[38:38.590 --> 38:40.030]  Does he know he's a meme yet?
[38:41.630 --> 38:42.470]  He must.
[38:43.330 --> 38:45.330]  I need to see some Gerbil clothing.
[38:45.370 --> 38:46.210]  Oh, what do we got?
[38:46.410 --> 38:48.810]  He's opening bingo cards for us.
[38:49.070 --> 38:49.390]  Do you want a rip?
[38:50.330 --> 38:51.850]  He's doing a rip.
[38:52.110 --> 38:53.230]  Is that like a deer's face?
[38:55.790 --> 38:57.530]  I can't see any of them.
[38:58.490 --> 39:02.030]  You know the best part about this?
[39:04.570 --> 39:05.830]  There's a bouncer going,
[39:05.950 --> 39:07.210]  what the fuck is he doing?
[39:07.210 --> 39:09.490]  What was that?
[39:10.150 --> 39:11.430]  Max is entertained.
[39:11.530 --> 39:12.250]  A bag of dogs?
[39:12.930 --> 39:14.290]  Ghosts and Graveyards tour.
[39:14.750 --> 39:16.010]  What are you looking at, nerd?
[39:16.510 --> 39:18.650]  Dude, this is so funny.
[39:18.970 --> 39:20.330]  This is genuinely...
[39:20.330 --> 39:21.830]  I really love this bit.
[39:22.290 --> 39:24.070]  This is a very funny bit.
[39:24.470 --> 39:25.710]  Oh no, he's giving away cards!
[39:27.490 --> 39:29.190]  Dude, live rip.
[39:30.390 --> 39:31.330]  Oh my god.
[39:31.690 --> 39:32.450]  That was amazing.
[39:32.930 --> 39:34.370]  That was a very funny bit.
[39:34.370 --> 39:36.090]  They're going to see the floppy Drew shirt
[39:36.090 --> 39:37.650]  and fucking sue us.
[39:38.290 --> 39:40.390]  That guy is probably wondering why the shirt
[39:40.390 --> 39:42.110]  has nothing to do with the establishment.
[39:42.590 --> 39:44.510]  Hey Eric, this guy in the black hat
[39:44.510 --> 39:45.650]  is dressed as Geoff the Drunk.
[39:48.230 --> 39:49.390]  It's fucking perfect.
[39:49.510 --> 39:50.070]  That's pretty good.
[39:55.570 --> 39:57.330]  Do you guys think
[39:57.330 --> 40:00.090]  we will ever go as a group
[40:00.090 --> 40:01.410]  to Key West again?
[40:02.450 --> 40:02.890]  Yes.
[40:03.590 --> 40:04.470]  Oh, wow.
[40:04.610 --> 40:05.930]  I would go again.
[40:06.770 --> 40:09.150]  I think we all would go again, but will we?
[40:09.270 --> 40:10.630]  I think that's the question.
[40:11.670 --> 40:11.870]  I wonder.
[40:12.710 --> 40:14.650]  Alright, there you go.
[40:22.370 --> 40:23.790]  That's a beach goth.
[40:24.750 --> 40:25.910]  Oh yeah, beach goth.
[40:27.350 --> 40:29.430]  Oh, I don't have it, of course.
[40:30.290 --> 40:31.450]  That would be too easy.
[40:33.750 --> 40:34.550]  I feel like
[40:34.550 --> 40:35.870]  new boot goofing.
[40:36.510 --> 40:38.050]  I think I have that too.
[40:38.550 --> 40:40.350]  Hey, does that pumpkin shirt count
[40:40.350 --> 40:40.990]  as pumpkin outfit?
[40:42.730 --> 40:44.030]  That's pumpkin attire.
[40:44.090 --> 40:45.150]  That's a bingo.
[40:46.150 --> 40:46.630]  Congratulations.
[40:47.310 --> 40:49.650]  Did you get the boo board bingo also? Way to go, man.
[40:49.750 --> 40:50.810]  I did.
[40:51.950 --> 40:53.710]  You can put your small cake on your cake.
[40:54.370 --> 40:57.030]  Are you the scream guy?
[40:57.510 --> 40:57.870]  Turn!
[40:58.630 --> 40:59.110]  Turn!
[41:00.170 --> 41:02.150]  That looks like the scream guy.
[41:02.910 --> 41:03.950]  That's Kyle Gass
[41:03.950 --> 41:04.650]  from Tenacious D.
[41:06.510 --> 41:07.630]  Is that a pawpaw?
[41:08.810 --> 41:09.330]  Where?
[41:10.110 --> 41:11.350]  That old guy?
[41:12.150 --> 41:13.510]  Nah, he's not hunched enough.
[41:14.090 --> 41:14.890]  More hunchage.
[41:16.310 --> 41:18.410]  Yeah, still that guy had a lot of living left in him.
[41:18.690 --> 41:19.250]  Pawpaw doesn't.
[41:21.410 --> 41:22.450]  Jesus Christ.
[41:22.650 --> 41:23.610]  Just being honest.
[41:24.530 --> 41:25.850]  Welfare, you know, I guess.
[41:26.450 --> 41:27.690]  He's had a long life.
[41:27.690 --> 41:29.290]  He's had a fulfilling life.
[41:29.430 --> 41:30.690]  We need to celebrate that.
[41:30.770 --> 41:32.470]  Not be sad that he's leaving us soon.
[41:38.990 --> 41:39.870]  Oh man.
[41:40.150 --> 41:40.710]  So should we
[41:40.710 --> 41:42.870]  just try to blank out our boo boards, I guess?
[41:43.350 --> 41:43.550]  Yeah.
[41:43.930 --> 41:44.990]  We haven't been going very long.
[41:45.510 --> 41:46.310]  We need to go.
[41:47.130 --> 41:48.410]  I don't want to rip the audience off.
[41:49.250 --> 41:51.810]  Halloween themed car, I haven't seen since before we started.
[41:52.090 --> 41:52.830]  I know.
[41:53.230 --> 41:54.990]  Yeah, there was the cum car in the beginning.
[41:55.390 --> 41:58.750]  And there was the car that had green ground effects that were flashing.
[42:03.540 --> 42:04.720]  Oh, two little dogs.
[42:06.480 --> 42:07.460]  Are they in costumes?
[42:07.960 --> 42:08.240]  No.
[42:08.360 --> 42:09.420]  No, they're just up there.
[42:09.860 --> 42:11.840]  I just need to see, at the same time, a motorcycle.
[42:12.180 --> 42:13.620]  Show me a motorcycle. YES!
[42:14.060 --> 42:14.800]  Dog and a hog!
[42:16.560 --> 42:17.860]  That's a great one, dude.
[42:18.200 --> 42:19.220]  That is a great one.
[42:19.740 --> 42:22.400]  That's a motorcycle.
[42:24.080 --> 42:25.020]  Yeah, that one's a motorcycle.
[42:25.220 --> 42:25.960]  Yeah, he's right.
[42:26.060 --> 42:26.760]  Those are motorcycles.
[42:27.280 --> 42:28.440]  For all intents and purposes.
[42:28.440 --> 42:28.820]  Yeah.
[42:30.740 --> 42:32.540]  But is that motorcycle Elvis?
[42:33.320 --> 42:34.060]  That is the question.
[42:37.760 --> 42:38.680]  A lot of people in chat
[42:38.680 --> 42:39.400]  saying it was Scooters.
[42:40.840 --> 42:42.600]  Oh, that's fine. We don't listen to the chat.
[42:43.020 --> 42:43.280]  Yeah.
[42:45.540 --> 42:46.920]  You must have just got here.
[42:47.860 --> 42:48.940]  You must be new here.
[42:52.260 --> 42:54.260]  I think there's a lot of truth in the chat.
[42:54.800 --> 42:55.620]  I totally agree.
[42:56.360 --> 42:56.880]  Yeah.
[42:57.300 --> 42:59.080]  I'm not worried about that.
[43:00.380 --> 43:01.420]  The cones are back.
[43:01.520 --> 43:02.320]  Have they outstayed their welcome?
[43:03.060 --> 43:04.840]  I'm telling you, that one cone,
[43:04.920 --> 43:06.300]  there's no way he can sit down.
[43:07.440 --> 43:09.260]  They have walked by three plus times.
[43:09.780 --> 43:11.360]  They've multiplied. There's more cones.
[43:11.980 --> 43:13.540]  Yeah, there were a lot over there.
[43:14.020 --> 43:14.600]  Look, Andrew!
[43:15.080 --> 43:15.480]  Santa!
[43:17.620 --> 43:17.940]  Santa!
[43:19.060 --> 43:20.300]  That's a boo for me!
[43:22.680 --> 43:23.720]  I'm telling you,
[43:23.720 --> 43:25.700]  that guy in the biggest cone,
[43:25.800 --> 43:27.280]  there's no way he can sit down.
[43:27.380 --> 43:28.320]  That's impractical.
[43:28.500 --> 43:30.800]  He's about to cross the street. I'm marking it.
[43:31.020 --> 43:31.840]  It's impossible.
[43:32.260 --> 43:33.320]  He just has to pull it up.
[43:35.560 --> 43:37.720]  The other guys
[43:37.720 --> 43:38.900]  absolutely can sit down.
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.220]  The guy where it goes to his ankles,
[43:40.620 --> 43:43.520]  the guy that's demure, he can't sit down.
[43:43.640 --> 43:45.180]  You could pop that over a chair.
[43:45.420 --> 43:46.900]  I'm gonna pop you over a chair.
[43:47.540 --> 43:47.960]  Easily.
[43:49.860 --> 43:50.300]  Nonsense.
[43:50.300 --> 43:52.500]  You can ask the chat
[43:52.500 --> 43:53.080]  if you want to.
[43:53.860 --> 43:54.820]  They'll agree.
[43:55.560 --> 43:56.660]  Yeah, I know they will.
[43:57.700 --> 43:59.260]  That guy dropped something.
[44:00.740 --> 44:01.800]  Oh, he's like,
[44:01.880 --> 44:03.780]  I'm a drunk guy. He's doing a bit.
[44:05.200 --> 44:06.120]  And she's filming it.
[44:06.380 --> 44:07.900]  He's so funny and clever.
[44:08.580 --> 44:08.760]  Yep.
[44:10.560 --> 44:11.440]  Who's this guy?
[44:13.320 --> 44:14.200]  He's dressed
[44:14.200 --> 44:14.940]  like an asshole.
[44:15.320 --> 44:18.200]  He looks like he dresses the bar
[44:18.200 --> 44:19.080]  off from Saved by the Bell.
[44:23.760 --> 44:25.960]  Oh, they were unamused by that guy's
[44:25.960 --> 44:26.580]  antics, too.
[44:29.740 --> 44:30.280]  Hey!
[44:31.600 --> 44:32.740]  There he is.
[44:36.400 --> 44:38.080]  That's for when he falls down later.
[44:38.380 --> 44:39.320]  Oh, damn it.
[44:40.680 --> 44:41.220]  What?
[44:41.760 --> 44:43.660]  Something that I thought was something different,
[44:43.780 --> 44:44.780]  but it wasn't that thing.
[44:44.780 --> 44:45.880]  No, it's not.
[44:50.140 --> 44:50.460]  Top!
[44:50.980 --> 44:51.960]  Top on the street.
[44:52.280 --> 44:53.160]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[44:55.060 --> 44:55.800]  Where's the cup?
[44:57.260 --> 44:58.560]  On the street, right there.
[44:59.060 --> 44:59.840]  At the street top.
[45:03.270 --> 45:04.590]  What is this guy
[45:04.590 --> 45:05.490]  supposed to be?
[45:07.310 --> 45:08.710]  Like, with his hat?
[45:08.770 --> 45:09.670]  He has, like, an outfit.
[45:10.490 --> 45:11.570]  What is that?
[45:13.550 --> 45:14.810]  Oh, he's that thing.
[45:14.810 --> 45:16.590]  He's that bottle that he's holding.
[45:16.670 --> 45:17.150]  Oh.
[45:17.550 --> 45:20.610]  I think the outfit...
[45:20.610 --> 45:20.910]  He's like a pepper shaker?
[45:22.350 --> 45:23.910]  No, he's like a big bottle of...
[45:23.910 --> 45:26.730]  I think his clothes is the outfit, and the bowl
[45:26.730 --> 45:28.670]  is so the government can't read his thoughts.
[45:28.830 --> 45:30.510]  I think they're two separate things.
[45:31.850 --> 45:32.830]  I didn't know Alex
[45:32.830 --> 45:33.670]  Jones moved to Florida.
[45:34.390 --> 45:34.970]  There's a referee.
[45:40.280 --> 45:42.080]  Nobody's eating candy at the street
[45:42.080 --> 45:43.500]  crossing. It's Little Caesars.
[45:44.060 --> 45:44.780]  Referee suit.
[45:45.420 --> 45:45.980]  He's...
[45:47.160 --> 45:48.980]  It's Pizza Pizza right there.
[45:50.980 --> 45:52.820]  He's clase azul
[45:53.440 --> 45:54.000]  reposado.
[45:54.400 --> 45:56.580]  I think. He's tequila.
[45:56.700 --> 45:57.440]  He's a tequila bottle.
[45:57.840 --> 46:00.500]  Isn't that the bottle that Gracie thought was an urn?
[46:00.640 --> 46:01.240]  I think so.
[46:01.920 --> 46:02.080]  Yeah.
[46:13.750 --> 46:16.650]  That dude looks pretty dressed up for being on a scooter.
[46:16.910 --> 46:18.210]  Yeah, that looks like formal
[46:18.210 --> 46:20.110]  attire on a moped.
[46:20.570 --> 46:22.170]  It is, absolutely.
[46:23.670 --> 46:24.130]  Wow.
[46:25.290 --> 46:26.490]  Dog wearing costume
[46:26.490 --> 46:27.390]  a hot dog costume.
[46:28.370 --> 46:30.410]  There's pizza costume.
[46:30.890 --> 46:31.390]  Pizza guy.
[46:35.030 --> 46:36.670]  Napoleon Dynamite.
[46:36.830 --> 46:38.410]  Everyone's favorite.
[46:39.590 --> 46:40.530]  Timely.
[46:42.170 --> 46:44.010]  And also good.
[46:44.130 --> 46:45.150]  Everybody loves.
[46:48.170 --> 46:48.810]  What's the name
[46:48.810 --> 46:49.430]  of that show?
[46:50.230 --> 46:51.230]  That we hated on
[46:51.230 --> 46:52.550]  Napoleon Dynamite for 30 minutes?
[46:54.190 --> 46:55.090]  Who are you?
[46:55.410 --> 46:55.910]  Who are you?
[46:57.910 --> 46:59.070]  I was like it was a movie.
[46:59.950 --> 47:01.150]  It also was a show.
[47:01.990 --> 47:02.630]  I died.
[47:03.510 --> 47:04.310]  What? For real?
[47:04.430 --> 47:06.890]  Yeah, they did a Fox animated Napoleon Dynamite show.
[47:07.270 --> 47:08.770]  It did not last longer than a season.
[47:09.350 --> 47:09.710]  God.
[47:12.370 --> 47:13.730]  That makes me even angrier.
[47:14.690 --> 47:15.730]  It was
[47:15.730 --> 47:16.650]  relatively recent.
[47:17.190 --> 47:18.350]  Get out of the car.
[47:21.590 --> 47:23.970]  I like describing mundane activities
[47:23.970 --> 47:25.570]  as if they're a bingo board thing.
[47:25.650 --> 47:27.430]  There's scream masks over there.
[47:28.490 --> 47:29.910]  Do you think that guy is a Yankees
[47:29.910 --> 47:31.990]  fan or a fan of New York?
[47:33.810 --> 47:34.330]  Neither.
[47:36.290 --> 47:37.130]  He's a tourist.
[47:42.670 --> 47:43.790]  Where are the fishnets?
[47:45.950 --> 47:46.350]  Where's
[47:46.350 --> 47:47.690]  the hot dog costumes?
[47:49.030 --> 47:49.890]  We've had pizza.
[47:50.330 --> 47:51.030]  I know.
[47:51.050 --> 47:52.690]  Is that Deadpool shorts?
[47:53.390 --> 47:53.790]  No.
[47:54.470 --> 47:56.790]  I think she's supposed to be like Harley Quinn or something.
[47:58.010 --> 47:59.050]  That checks out.
[47:59.190 --> 48:01.610]  I just took a break to watch the guys do the handshake again.
[48:01.790 --> 48:02.530]  It made me laugh.
[48:05.590 --> 48:06.570]  It's so funny.
[48:08.250 --> 48:09.510]  I can't wait to zoom in on it
[48:09.510 --> 48:10.490]  and slow it down later.
[48:10.490 --> 48:12.050]  It's so cabinet sober.
[48:12.330 --> 48:13.670]  Make sure you put it up.
[48:14.730 --> 48:16.130]  There's like 3,000 people
[48:16.130 --> 48:17.210]  watching this nonsense.
[48:17.630 --> 48:18.470]  Pick it up, Florida.
[48:20.270 --> 48:22.810]  Sloppy Joe is not very sloppy tonight on Halloween, guys.
[48:24.370 --> 48:26.730]  I think it may have been sloppier earlier.
[48:27.130 --> 48:29.190]  Yeah, it was so sloppy earlier.
[48:29.650 --> 48:30.070]  Crazy.
[48:30.350 --> 48:31.110]  It like de-slopped.
[48:31.170 --> 48:32.970]  Many people started at lunch.
[48:33.430 --> 48:35.990]  We don't want to do it this late in the game, but in the future
[48:35.990 --> 48:38.530]  we can always just drag the fucking bar back.
[48:38.530 --> 48:39.750]  It goes back 12 hours.
[48:40.790 --> 48:41.890]  Oh, that's true.
[48:43.870 --> 48:45.170]  Oh, they're back!
[48:45.950 --> 48:46.890]  High five!
[48:50.370 --> 48:51.850]  That's Heisenberg, maybe.
[48:52.930 --> 48:53.690]  Probably not.
[48:53.770 --> 48:54.950]  Sweet stache, though, I have that.
[48:55.730 --> 48:58.090]  Fuck, that's so funny. They made up for it.
[48:58.190 --> 48:58.850]  That's so funny.
[48:59.610 --> 49:00.730]  Dan is MVP tonight.
[49:02.870 --> 49:04.330]  First time in his life.
[49:11.400 --> 49:13.560]  Did Nick really like that?
[49:13.800 --> 49:14.620]  It was funny.
[49:17.450 --> 49:19.950]  This guy just looks like he wants to fight.
[49:20.730 --> 49:21.690]  Which guy?
[49:22.070 --> 49:22.750]  Skeletons.
[49:23.290 --> 49:24.930]  Hug, hug.
[49:25.310 --> 49:27.230]  What are you doing here?
[49:27.870 --> 49:29.730]  That's crazy. You're here?
[49:30.050 --> 49:31.050]  I do have hug.
[49:31.610 --> 49:32.170]  There you go.
[49:33.490 --> 49:33.850]  Sweet.
[49:34.550 --> 49:35.050]  I got fireworks.
[49:37.170 --> 49:38.610]  Happy Gilmore.
[49:38.610 --> 49:39.270]  Happy Gilmore.
[49:43.270 --> 49:45.290]  Why doesn't anybody fall?
[49:46.870 --> 49:47.850]  They never do, do they?
[49:53.100 --> 49:54.820]  And a fucking guy dressed as an urn
[49:54.820 --> 49:55.980]  before we get fake blood.
[49:56.900 --> 49:58.800]  We got a guy dressed as an urn
[49:58.800 --> 50:00.380]  before we get a body paint costume
[50:00.380 --> 50:01.620]  in fucking Key West.
[50:04.600 --> 50:06.920]  This guy has overstayed his welcome.
[50:08.460 --> 50:09.500]  I'm saying it.
[50:10.620 --> 50:11.700]  Yeah, big time.
[50:11.700 --> 50:12.620]  Overstay. I agree.
[50:13.700 --> 50:14.820]  Mark it.
[50:15.360 --> 50:17.520]  He twerked.
[50:18.080 --> 50:19.180]  Does that count as dancing?
[50:20.480 --> 50:20.840]  Yeah.
[50:21.480 --> 50:22.240]  I'd give it to you.
[50:23.520 --> 50:24.960]  American flag clothes.
[50:26.300 --> 50:27.400]  Sunglasses at night.
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.120]  Chug it.
[50:32.180 --> 50:32.620]  He chugged it.
[50:33.720 --> 50:35.020]  There's a level of desperation
[50:35.020 --> 50:37.460]  where you have to hold the thing you're dressed as
[50:37.460 --> 50:39.240]  to illustrate what you're dressed as.
[50:39.240 --> 50:39.820]  I'm this.
[50:40.500 --> 50:40.980]  Yeah.
[50:44.040 --> 50:45.080]  Obviously dyed hair.
[50:45.300 --> 50:46.620]  I really like this thing I'm holding.
[50:48.020 --> 50:48.880]  Can you tell?
[50:50.240 --> 50:51.560]  I'm just gonna stand here.
[50:51.860 --> 50:52.720]  You can take a picture with me.
[50:52.940 --> 50:55.120]  If he tripped
[50:55.120 --> 50:57.480]  and that helmet fell off, that little bulb...
[50:58.440 --> 50:59.400]  Fucking clanging
[50:59.400 --> 51:00.260]  down the street.
[51:03.200 --> 51:04.880]  It's run over by a car.
[51:06.460 --> 51:07.240]  This is a
[51:07.240 --> 51:08.340]  bachelorette party, I guess.
[51:08.560 --> 51:10.020]  Yeah, bachelorette party for sure.
[51:10.280 --> 51:10.680]  Thank you.
[51:15.030 --> 51:17.290]  I see somebody almost get hit by a car.
[51:19.310 --> 51:20.010]  Me too.
[51:24.500 --> 51:25.200]  I'm pretty sure
[51:25.200 --> 51:25.660]  everything has been dropped.
[51:25.660 --> 51:28.160]  I don't want it to happen, but somebody getting hit by a car
[51:28.160 --> 51:30.240]  and Nick fucking pivoting the puppy.
[51:33.080 --> 51:33.960]  Oh no.
[51:33.960 --> 51:34.820]  Yeah.
[51:37.840 --> 51:39.840]  The Super J card.
[51:48.940 --> 51:50.880]  I ain't afraid.
[51:51.800 --> 51:52.700]  I'm not sure
[51:52.700 --> 51:54.920]  what she's not afraid of. Nice beard, dude.
[51:55.380 --> 51:56.880]  That is purely neck.
[51:57.260 --> 51:57.660]  That beard.
[52:03.390 --> 52:05.290]  I can't believe we didn't see
[52:05.290 --> 52:05.910]  Sweet Stache.
[52:06.450 --> 52:09.770]  I can't believe we didn't see a single penis costume.
[52:09.770 --> 52:11.770]  I'm like, I'm absolutely
[52:11.770 --> 52:12.230]  floored.
[52:13.350 --> 52:14.550]  It's not 11 yet.
[52:15.330 --> 52:16.570]  Yeah, it's still pretty early.
[52:16.990 --> 52:18.170]  It's at the weird time.
[52:20.030 --> 52:21.710]  Everybody showed up for like a parade
[52:21.710 --> 52:22.950]  or something earlier, probably.
[52:23.270 --> 52:25.730]  Although there's not any stanchions
[52:25.730 --> 52:27.070]  piled up, so I guess there was one.
[52:36.760 --> 52:37.540]  Oh, is that guy
[52:37.540 --> 52:37.960]  waiting up?
[52:38.580 --> 52:40.620]  Yeah, he yelled to wait up.
[52:41.180 --> 52:43.400]  I just need
[52:43.400 --> 52:44.340]  new boot goofing.
[52:44.920 --> 52:45.360]  Damn.
[52:46.020 --> 52:47.700]  For what? And you're blacked out?
[52:48.200 --> 52:48.440]  No.
[52:52.820 --> 52:53.700]  I need
[52:53.700 --> 52:56.360]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
[52:56.360 --> 52:57.860]  14 to black out.
[52:58.300 --> 52:59.840]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
[52:59.840 --> 53:02.140]  It used to take me about 22, 23 shots
[53:02.140 --> 53:02.780]  to black out.
[53:03.980 --> 53:05.740]  That lady's got a pumpkin purse.
[53:05.940 --> 53:06.880]  Anybody still looking for that?
[53:08.620 --> 53:09.560]  I got pumpkin.
[53:10.180 --> 53:10.760]  Thank you, though.
[53:10.760 --> 53:10.860]  Yeah.
[53:13.680 --> 53:14.800]  What's his shirt say?
[53:15.880 --> 53:16.760]  Something BAM.
[53:17.380 --> 53:18.920]  We've already seen offensive shirt,
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.420]  I think. Yeah, I think so, too.
[53:20.880 --> 53:21.640]  Oh, I missed it.
[53:22.180 --> 53:24.720]  It was earlier where a guy's like
[53:24.720 --> 53:26.540]  free candy with like a big arrow
[53:26.540 --> 53:28.840]  pointing down that said like, keep digging.
[53:29.120 --> 53:30.360]  And it's like, alright, man.
[53:31.120 --> 53:32.400]  What's happening over here?
[53:32.920 --> 53:34.220]  Oh, this guy's having a good night.
[53:34.560 --> 53:36.600]  I don't know, but if he fucking falls, I will be
[53:36.600 --> 53:37.360]  so happy.
[53:42.010 --> 53:42.570]  Whoa.
[53:42.770 --> 53:43.130]  Screaming?
[53:43.950 --> 53:44.990]  Yeah. Fun.
[53:47.090 --> 53:47.370]  Fun.
[53:48.110 --> 53:49.690]  Look at those heels just across the street.
[53:50.650 --> 53:51.870]  Is that Nooboo Goofin?
[53:52.150 --> 53:54.270]  That is Nooboo Goofin
[53:54.270 --> 53:54.950]  right there, dude.
[53:55.710 --> 53:56.430]  Got a little bingo.
[53:57.910 --> 53:58.930]  Very nice.
[54:00.630 --> 54:01.690]  I scared him.
[54:01.850 --> 54:02.490]  Wait, the scream!
[54:02.770 --> 54:05.110]  Wait, that was the scream mask on her shirt.
[54:05.410 --> 54:05.630]  Where?
[54:07.250 --> 54:08.430]  Back up, lady!
[54:09.030 --> 54:10.910]  I saw it. I saw it.
[54:10.970 --> 54:12.030]  I saw it.
[54:13.310 --> 54:14.070]  He's right.
[54:14.810 --> 54:16.070]  Andrew, are you eating ice cream?
[54:17.570 --> 54:19.530]  A little slice of pizza
[54:19.530 --> 54:20.010]  real quick.
[54:21.470 --> 54:23.510]  Must be nice. Must be fucking
[54:23.510 --> 54:24.110]  nice.
[54:26.990 --> 54:27.630]  That's a boo
[54:27.630 --> 54:28.750]  for me. I got it.
[54:28.930 --> 54:37.280]  I don't think I'm getting the boo. I can't get
[54:38.160 --> 54:39.460]  cosplayer, high-quality
[54:39.460 --> 54:41.360]  costume or inflatable costume.
[54:42.100 --> 54:43.540]  The lack of inflatable
[54:43.540 --> 54:44.560]  really shocks me.
[54:45.440 --> 54:46.820]  Penis costume, no inflatable?
[54:47.280 --> 54:49.020]  No one's the big T-Rex?
[54:49.420 --> 54:51.240]  You'd think the T-Rex and a penis
[54:51.240 --> 54:51.980]  would be everywhere.
[54:52.740 --> 54:54.620]  A huge lack of Wolverines.
[54:55.160 --> 54:57.620]  Yeah, none. And Deadpools for that matter.
[54:58.220 --> 54:59.360]  Or costume dogs.
[54:59.440 --> 55:00.900]  That dog's got no costume. He's out too late.
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.480]  But he does have a costume on. Yeah, it's just a normal dog.
[55:04.160 --> 55:05.220]  Out too late. That guy's got
[55:05.220 --> 55:06.520]  jeans and flip-flops on.
[55:07.140 --> 55:09.220]  Oh, he sure does. I'm trying to open another
[55:09.220 --> 55:10.940]  tab to see if I can
[55:10.940 --> 55:13.020]  find the camera in the bar still
[55:13.020 --> 55:14.820]  to get a read on who's gonna walk out.
[55:15.120 --> 55:15.680]  Oh, that's smart.
[55:17.880 --> 55:19.060]  That seems like insider
[55:19.060 --> 55:19.860]  trading to me.
[55:20.700 --> 55:23.220]  Well, it doesn't help me at all. It's just knowing what's
[55:23.220 --> 55:25.220]  inside. Yeah, so when
[55:25.220 --> 55:26.900]  you see them walk towards the exit, you can
[55:26.900 --> 55:29.380]  Oh, look guys! Oh yeah, that's a good point.
[55:29.760 --> 55:31.180]  What do you mean? No, it's a terrible
[55:31.180 --> 55:32.820]  point. What do you mean? He's also
[55:32.820 --> 55:34.940]  We all also have
[55:34.940 --> 55:37.180]  access to the same fucking camera he's about to look at.
[55:37.260 --> 55:38.980]  You can all do it. I can't look at that
[55:38.980 --> 55:40.880]  if you know what I'm doing right now.
[55:41.620 --> 55:42.900]  Put a fucking hat
[55:42.900 --> 55:44.720]  on the dog or something!
[55:45.700 --> 55:46.800]  Jesus, bow tie!
[55:48.420 --> 55:49.020]  That truck
[55:49.020 --> 55:50.940]  had, I just realized, purple and green
[55:50.940 --> 55:52.920]  lights flashing underneath. Yeah, that's how
[55:52.920 --> 55:54.040]  we call it out in time.
[55:54.860 --> 55:56.220]  Does that count as Halloween themed lights?
[55:57.060 --> 55:58.740]  Yes, that would count as Halloween themed lights.
[55:59.180 --> 56:00.380]  I think Nick is making it up.
[56:00.380 --> 56:02.480]  I don't think it counts as gerpal clothing
[56:02.480 --> 56:04.240]  though. Oh, the sticky bandits are out?
[56:05.540 --> 56:06.560]  But it counts as
[56:06.560 --> 56:08.200]  Halloween themed car lights, which is what I need.
[56:08.460 --> 56:10.660]  And I need Halloween themed cars, so I'm doing it.
[56:11.320 --> 56:12.520]  Put some fucking purple
[56:12.520 --> 56:14.120]  shorts on his head. Ghost bus!
[56:15.160 --> 56:15.860]  You know what, Gavin?
[56:17.860 --> 56:18.260]  Handshake.
[56:18.540 --> 56:19.820]  Good job. Good deal. Hell yeah.
[56:20.620 --> 56:21.020]  Ratatouille!
[56:22.440 --> 56:23.600]  That's a Ratatouille!
[56:23.980 --> 56:26.060]  That's a great costume. And Elvis!
[56:26.440 --> 56:26.760]  Elvis!
[56:28.760 --> 56:29.120]  Oh!
[56:36.720 --> 56:37.720]  I don't think anyone's
[56:37.720 --> 56:38.520]  going to trip tonight.
[56:39.420 --> 56:41.340]  Everybody seems so sure-footed.
[56:42.700 --> 56:43.960]  The guy in the robe
[56:43.960 --> 56:45.720]  at the top, I think, has a chance
[56:45.720 --> 56:47.720]  of tripping. Look at the way the robe is around his leg.
[56:47.800 --> 56:49.840]  Also, I think he might be a flasher, so we should be careful.
[56:53.560 --> 56:54.380]  Trip, trip.
[56:55.500 --> 56:57.420]  I was really thinking that guy was going to have
[56:57.420 --> 56:58.120]  a peanut butter jar.
[56:58.980 --> 56:59.260]  Tail.
[57:01.220 --> 57:01.820]  Man, people
[57:01.820 --> 57:03.340]  gotta stop trying to rock
[57:03.340 --> 57:05.540]  top hats. It's over.
[57:09.660 --> 57:10.980]  Is that trying to get in the wrong car?
[57:11.240 --> 57:12.140]  Try to get in the wrong car!
[57:13.780 --> 57:14.160]  Yeah!
[57:15.460 --> 57:15.680]  Woo!
[57:16.860 --> 57:19.140]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[57:19.300 --> 57:20.560]  7's left. I only need 7.
[57:22.100 --> 57:22.360]  Damn.
[57:22.720 --> 57:25.280]  Somebody get separated at the crosswalk while sucking on a chili dog
[57:25.280 --> 57:27.320]  and then calling home about the camera while wearing a fanny pack.
[57:28.060 --> 57:29.660]  Oh, I need a fanny pack as well.
[57:29.880 --> 57:33.760]  Does that purse count as a fanny pack?
[57:34.020 --> 57:35.340]  Do you think it does?
[57:37.080 --> 57:38.700]  Do you want me to help you?
[57:39.160 --> 57:40.920]  No! I want to win, Nick.
[57:41.160 --> 57:42.840]  I want to win honestly.
[57:43.620 --> 57:45.160]  This woman's a bit stumbly.
[57:45.700 --> 57:47.160]  Good. Take a spill.
[57:49.460 --> 57:50.900]  She made it.
[57:51.360 --> 57:51.740]  Uh.
[57:53.360 --> 57:53.660]  Nick.
[57:58.930 --> 58:00.270]  I would go back to Key West.
[58:00.630 --> 58:02.530]  Like, no hesitation. I'd go back to Key West.
[58:03.690 --> 58:05.470]  Well, maybe we should do it at some point.
[58:08.330 --> 58:09.430]  Oh, it's Satan.
[58:12.110 --> 58:13.130]  Big S himself.
[58:14.630 --> 58:15.390]  Big S.
[58:17.110 --> 58:18.630]  That's a cool costume and all, Satan.
[58:18.730 --> 58:20.830]  But what if you were a hot dog instead?
[58:23.570 --> 58:24.470]  Not a fanny pack.
[58:25.150 --> 58:26.330]  You don't think that was a fanny pack?
[58:26.790 --> 58:28.990]  On the lady in white?
[58:29.890 --> 58:30.670]  Yeah, that's a fanny pack.
[58:33.270 --> 58:35.350]  Now go around the corner and suck on a chili dog
[58:35.350 --> 58:36.190]  and almost get hit by a car.
[58:38.870 --> 58:39.750]  That's a dickhead truck.
[58:40.570 --> 58:41.490]  That is a dickhead truck.
[58:41.610 --> 58:42.170]  We've had a bunch.
[58:44.550 --> 58:45.630]  Put a fucking
[58:46.130 --> 58:47.850]  pair of wings on it.
[58:52.110 --> 58:53.230]  I can't tell
[58:53.230 --> 58:55.050]  if Pitbull's overstayed his welcome
[58:55.050 --> 58:56.330]  or if that's a different Pitbull.
[58:56.370 --> 58:57.290]  No, no, it's the same guy.
[58:58.910 --> 58:59.710]  Double fisting.
[59:03.170 --> 59:05.510]  But I need double fisting buckets of candy.
[59:05.710 --> 59:06.510]  Hey, look, it's Elvis.
[59:08.730 --> 59:09.690]  Hey, he's here.
[59:10.350 --> 59:11.230]  That one could be Elvis.
[59:11.530 --> 59:11.790]  Yeah.
[59:12.770 --> 59:13.850]  Who did he just finger guns?
[59:14.810 --> 59:16.410]  Just a guy in a wig.
[59:17.010 --> 59:17.410]  Ratatouille.
[59:18.890 --> 59:19.870]  Ratatouille's a great costume.
[59:19.870 --> 59:21.250]  It's so good.
[59:21.870 --> 59:23.470]  Oh, hell yeah!
[59:23.970 --> 59:24.530]  They're dancing.
[59:25.070 --> 59:28.510]  I don't think he's an actual Elvis impersonator, guys.
[59:29.310 --> 59:30.590]  I think that's Elvis.
[59:32.770 --> 59:33.950]  He might be
[59:33.950 --> 59:34.570]  the guy.
[59:42.670 --> 59:45.120]  It just reminded me of Jack from Haunter.
[59:49.720 --> 59:50.740]  They're having
[59:50.740 --> 59:52.540]  so much fun.
[59:52.580 --> 59:54.020]  They're having a great time.
[59:54.780 --> 59:56.420]  We need to schedule out
[59:56.420 --> 59:58.960]  three hours one day, Eric, and just finish Ratatouille.
[59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.280]  Just knock it out in a day.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:03.420]  I agree, and I think it's pretty bold to say it will only take three hours.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:04.880]  Has everybody guessed
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.980]  it on a Ratatouille yet?
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:07.940]  Not Gavin.
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.440]  You should really make
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.720]  Force Gavin 2.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.460]  You really gotta make everybody go through it.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.240]  It's brutal.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:21.620]  The dancing is still happening.
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:23.840]  They're really having a good time.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.100]  I don't like it.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.700]  If the bouncer bounced them, that would be
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:31.760]  the funniest thing ever.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.580]  Oh my god, that would be amazing.
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.960]  Number 30, I can't tell.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.740]  You would think obviously dyed hair would be a thing
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:41.080]  tonight.
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.080]  That's a really bad Elvis wig.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.020]  Yeah, was his hair ever like that?
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.400]  Maybe when he died.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.720]  Maybe when they found him.
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:56.600]  Boy, they're just going to do it all fucking night long, aren't they?
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.760]  People just trying to walk around them.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.800]  There's so much
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.300]  other Duval Street
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.360]  for you guys to annoy.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.580]  He's going apeshit.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.940]  Yeah, but there's not a camera in those corners.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.000]  That is true.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.020]  He's going to fool the street.
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:13.280]  That would be amazing if he did.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.940]  Just annoying everybody.
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:16.640]  Nobody's amused by it
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.420]  at this point.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.300]  If he falls, I get my
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:22.880]  fucking dance.
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.840]  The least you could do is
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.760]  fall. Take a knee.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:28.660]  I think that was a popo.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:33.880]  Where?
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.020]  I think that Elvis
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.140]  was a fucking papa.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.500]  But I won't count it.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.960]  Nah, he was too spry.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.460]  American flag clothing.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.560]  Dude, Nick, my friend
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.840]  Emily, who used to work at Rooster Teeth.
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:49.820]  She was
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.240]  Madam Web for Halloween.
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.180]  She bought the knock-off
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.440]  Gucci sunglasses
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.760]  and she just told me
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.900]  the day that I tried on the glasses, I had
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.200]  a vision and it came true.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.240]  I was really hoping they wouldn't go in.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:08.880]  Oh!
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.420]  They didn't.
[01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:15.270]  Just walk on.
[01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:17.890]  Just keep on walking.
[01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:19.750]  What are
[01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:20.590]  these skulls?
[01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:23.990]  Oh, we've had on the fence a few times.
[01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:24.710]  Okay.
[01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:27.170]  But they're definitely not going to go in.
[01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:28.230]  They're going to keep walking.
[01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:30.010]  Is that guy supposed to be Hitman?
[01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:33.470]  I think he's supposed to be the spirit.
[01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:40.050]  Oh, he still has a dog.
[01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:41.030]  He's carrying the dog.
[01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:44.330]  The dog's fucking exhausted because it's out too late.
[01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:46.090]  And he didn't even put it in a costume
[01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:47.470]  so it doesn't get to be festive.
[01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:50.250]  Is this guy in the weed hat a popo?
[01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.910]  No.
[01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:55.750]  He wears a skull t-shirt.
[01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:56.710]  He's way too young.
[01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:58.610]  He's out there with his homie.
[01:02:58.810 --> 01:03:01.770]  He likes weed and skulls, dude. Come on.
[01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:05.490]  Is that guy saying that
[01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:07.750]  America's a pirate nation?
[01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:11.650]  I don't think it's that deep.
[01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:16.610]  That is drunk
[01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:17.450]  walking right there.
[01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:19.150]  Oh, it sure is.
[01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:21.170]  That was close.
[01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:24.150]  He needs some water now.
[01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:26.610]  If that guy falls hard enough, maybe he can be in a wheelchair.
[01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:28.190]  Dude, this guy fell early.
[01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:28.790]  Look at this boot.
[01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:32.570]  Oh, there's a bandage
[01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:33.270]  if a man needs it.
[01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:34.770]  Hell yeah, I do.
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.340]  My blackout's just never going to happen.
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:41.260]  Freddy Krueger!
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.200]  I feel like sucking on a chili dog
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.080]  never happens.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.580]  Trip is so rare.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.280]  Dude, clown car? No shot.
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.720]  Sucking on a chili dog
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.340]  happens, I think,
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:53.900]  usually.
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.200]  Maybe the guy's not out tonight because it's a holiday.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.300]  Although you'd think he'd be slinging chili dogs
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:03:59.860]  even harder.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.820]  Dude, I could go for a chili dog right now.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.920]  I just haven't seen anyone dogging it.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.180]  I have fucking hot dogs
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.840]  and no buns right now.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:10.840]  Did you see
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.960]  that dog I posted the other day, Geoff?
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:13.800]  I did, it looked good.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:15.820]  Dude, that was from Mighty Fine.
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.780]  Was it really? Yeah.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.180]  I never think about getting their dog.
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:24.880]  I'd never had it before, but I just had a cheeseburger
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.340]  earlier in the day, so
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.580]  I decided to change it up a little.
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:29.740]  Dude, I'm going to do that.
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.800]  I had some from Five Guys the other day that were fucking great.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:36.720]  That guy,
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.220]  is he dressed as Lieutenant Dangle?
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:41.200]  Because if he is, those are the boots from New Boot Goofin,
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:41.860]  where it came from.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.040]  Yes, he is.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.180]  New Boot Goofin.
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.200]  How many boots does everybody need?
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.000]  I need four.
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.140]  I also need four.
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.960]  One, two, three, four, five.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.200]  I need five.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.720]  I'm just not getting them.
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.000]  That is actually pretty incredible that the actual
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.100]  New Boot Goofin
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:14.580]  boots came through.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.000]  That is pretty wild.
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:17.740]  The inspiration for the bit.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.260]  That could have been your suggestion if you got it in
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:20.940]  early enough, Gavin.
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:22.580]  Actual New Boot Goofin.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.820]  Come on, you.
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.540]  I don't think we're getting fallers.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.060]  As I said, Geoff, when you picked it,
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.380]  it would be the greatest moment of my life to witness
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.660]  somebody fall in a Halloween costume, and I just
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:44.640]  don't see that happen.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.220]  Man, I just got to hope for it.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:48.600]  You figure people start drinking
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.520]  early, their equilibrium
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.440]  is off because they're wearing a weird
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:52.960]  costume.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.220]  It's a great point.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:57.700]  Is this our guy again on the phone?
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:05:59.880]  Yeah.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:00.700]  Yeah, it is.
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:02.660]  That's Handshake Guy.
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:06.560]  You think he's calling
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:07.580]  home about the camera?
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:10.500]  I think that's what he's trying to do.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.520]  He's like, alright, be honest, how bad was it?
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.760]  He's not acknowledging
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.200]  the camera while he's on the phone,
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.960]  which is really making it hard.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.040]  Did somebody have a fake blood one?
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:23.420]  I did.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.860]  Did you get it already?
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.600]  That lady just walked by with fake blood.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.940]  She was like a vampire lady.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:31.720]  She had fake blood going down her mouth.
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.340]  Okay, I'll take it.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.540]  You didn't fucking see it.
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:36.780]  Oh, I missed it.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.580]  Did we count
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.360]  those dudes in the scary masks as a
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.180]  horror movie costume?
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:46.720]  Dudes in scary masks?
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:48.140]  Oh, the rug cubs?
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.660]  I don't think that's horror movie.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.260]  Oh, never mind.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.540]  The scream mask was a shirt.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:55.340]  It was, yeah.
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:56.820]  So it wasn't a costume.
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:58.640]  It doesn't count for me.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.440]  How does that not count? The thing is scream mask.
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:03.400]  It was on the shirt.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.020]  But it's the mask of scream.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.580]  I mean, if I got Andrew's face from a shirt as well,
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.460]  I feel like...
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.500]  But Nick's is horror movie costume.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.440]  It's costume specific.
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:15.880]  Would you consider
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.960]  Home Alone to be a horror movie?
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:19.820]  Rain. It's raining.
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:21.960]  It just started raining.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.960]  That's a disaster.
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:27.580]  Oh, that's bad for the body painters.
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:29.300]  That guy's going too fast to hit the rain.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.840]  What if he fell right back there?
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:35.640]  I bet he doesn't know how to drive it that far.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.580]  Did the rain stop?
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:36.640]  I don't know.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.880]  It looks like it.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.040]  It looks like it rained for one second.
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:43.800]  That was crazy.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.280]  In Florida, man.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:48.900]  That's what happened today here.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.340]  You're talking about crashing a vehicle
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.340]  gave me the sudden urge to play GTA.
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:55.180]  Oh, you guys are talking about playing GTA?
[01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:00.550]  That fucking game.
[01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:02.550]  You can boot it up right now.
[01:08:02.790 --> 01:08:04.610]  Did you play more COD or what?
[01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.690]  I did.
[01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:08.870]  I've been trying to unlock perks and shit.
[01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.930]  I've been playing all day.
[01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:12.170]  What level are you?
[01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:12.950]  16.
[01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:16.610]  Dan's back.
[01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:17.550]  Have peanut butter.
[01:08:17.730 --> 01:08:18.470]  He's got a chili dog.
[01:08:20.190 --> 01:08:22.270]  That son of a bitch!
[01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:23.970]  He's not eating it yet.
[01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:25.550]  Where's your peanut butter?
[01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:29.050]  Pumpkin!
[01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:32.010]  Hell yeah!
[01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:33.790]  I need peanut butter!
[01:08:33.790 --> 01:08:35.150]  Way to go, Dan.
[01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:37.950]  Cheers to you, sir.
[01:08:40.650 --> 01:08:42.270]  Go almost get hit by a car.
[01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:43.830]  No!
[01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:45.370]  Don't do that.
[01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:48.190]  He's calling home about the camera.
[01:08:49.830 --> 01:08:51.230]  He's acknowledged the camera.
[01:08:51.610 --> 01:08:52.410]  He's on the phone.
[01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:54.150]  He's calling home about the camera.
[01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:00.350]  I just realized
[01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:03.110]  it raining really hurts my sitting on the street.
[01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:04.890]  Yeah, same.
[01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:06.450]  Is that a cop?
[01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:09.350]  He's hauling.
[01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:11.690]  I need four for a blackout.
[01:09:12.130 --> 01:09:13.250]  What if he's after Dan?
[01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:14.290]  I need
[01:09:15.670 --> 01:09:17.310]  almost get hit by a car,
[01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.910]  clown car,
[01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:21.730]  trip, and separate at a crosswalk.
[01:09:22.230 --> 01:09:23.330]  There's just no shot.
[01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:25.170]  He almost tripped.
[01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:27.710]  He's just drunk.
[01:09:28.450 --> 01:09:28.990]  Close, though.
[01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:32.130]  If only
[01:09:32.130 --> 01:09:34.490]  it was seasonal Florida for the winter.
[01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:36.630]  We could get some ice on the streets
[01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:37.390]  in the winter.
[01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:39.850]  Really boost the slipping.
[01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:43.510]  Oh, what's
[01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:45.730]  Dan cooking up in the background?
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:53.620]  Oh, that's
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.600]  purple clothing. That's green and purple
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.100]  on that fucking skull.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:58.440]  Where?
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:01.720]  The old guys that are not
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:02.880]  people.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.060]  The rainbow skull?
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:06.900]  That's green and purple.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.080]  It's a rainbow.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:09.480]  That's gurple.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.160]  I just need to have those two colors, right?
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:13.940]  Geoff, no.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.180]  Geoff, there's a spirit to this.
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:18.020]  Oh, my God.
[01:10:30.370 --> 01:10:31.390]  Where's the Wolverine?
[01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:39.290]  Playing Usher.
[01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:41.070]  Awesome.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.300]  Oh, there's pumpkin.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:49.600]  Sweet. Pumpkin.
[01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:54.470]  I've given up on
[01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:55.350]  peanut butter, I think.
[01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.910]  I guess it might be a regional thing.
[01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:00.410]  Which region?
[01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.890]  Something like that.
[01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:04.510]  Maybe Dan will come back with one.
[01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:06.110]  He's come back with a couple things to help.
[01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:08.510]  Poor Dan's fucking wondering around Key West
[01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:10.490]  right now trying to find a store that sells peanut
[01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:12.530]  butter at 1030 at night.
[01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:14.670]  Does this gift shop
[01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:15.310]  have peanut butter?
[01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:18.390]  Where's the closest place you can get peanut butter from?
[01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:19.530]  Sloppy Geoff.
[01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:22.570]  I'm going to look up peanut butter
[01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:23.210]  on Google Maps.
[01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:26.370]  There's a CVS like a block away.
[01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:28.650]  It's open 24 hours as well.
[01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:30.650]  They sell
[01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:32.450]  tweezers for pulling urchin out of your foot.
[01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:33.610]  It's true, they do.
[01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:34.670]  Yeah, they do.
[01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:38.650]  Remember when that...
[01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:39.470]  Remember when our
[01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:42.390]  captain started waving his arms
[01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:44.450]  like fucking crazy in another boat just to say hi?
[01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:45.230]  Yeah.
[01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:47.290]  What are you doing?
[01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:49.730]  We got kicked off a boat because he stole the wrong boat.
[01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:50.890]  Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:53.510]  He stole the wrong boat.
[01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:54.470]  Yeah, it was pretty awesome.
[01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:57.450]  Remember when he had a black eye because he fell off the boat
[01:11:57.450 --> 01:11:58.070]  the night before?
[01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:01.230]  Remember all the other stuff that we never talked about
[01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:01.850]  on camera?
[01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:05.370]  Do you think the guy
[01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:07.090]  in blue is trying to report a crime
[01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:08.410]  to that guy and he's like,
[01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:10.110]  I'm just not a cop.
[01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:11.350]  Ossifer, Ossifer!
[01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:23.550]  Hot dog costume, please.
[01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:26.130]  Are those fishnets?
[01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:27.310]  No.
[01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:29.530]  Those are tights.
[01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:31.490]  Those are not fishnets.
[01:12:32.050 --> 01:12:32.890]  Yeah, sorry, buddy.
[01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:35.650]  Those are not fishnets, those are jeans.
[01:12:38.710 --> 01:12:39.670]  That's good at this.
[01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:42.430]  Well, I'm the one that invented it.
[01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:43.030]  What do you want from me?
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:47.440]  Gavin invented griffball.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.420]  That is true.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:53.820]  Oh, tricycle.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.920]  That may be the 800th
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.120]  tricycle of the stream.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.720]  I just realized I had it.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.760]  I just realized I had it, so...
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:08.760]  Alright, here comes Dan.
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:10.180]  I bet he's got his peanut butter.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.560]  Well, at least he's not a litterbug.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.100]  Thank you, Dan.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.600]  Although I could have used litterbug.
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.180]  He's hiding?
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:20.320]  He's hiding?
[01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:22.800]  What is he doing?
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.640]  Is the camera shy?
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:28.320]  What's this thing right there?
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.240]  In the corner that he's standing by?
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.540]  Oh, there's purple.
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:33.620]  It's like a sunglasses store, isn't it?
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:35.460]  That's where you go and they have
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:38.260]  maps and shit for things to do.
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:39.760]  That little kiosk?
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.920]  That little kiosk thing is like a little maps
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:44.720]  and whatever thing.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.320]  Where's the CVS?
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.040]  Man, oh, that...
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.480]  It may have mullet.
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:59.900]  You can't tell, but it might have a mullet.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:01.500]  This might be my first stream
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.660]  without mullet on my card.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:03.460]  Yeah, right.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.420]  Oh, hold on.
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:06.520]  Oh, there's Fred Flintstone.
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.300]  I don't know why that was so funny to me.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:12.980]  What was looking rough, man?
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.180]  Fred's looking real rough.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.100]  Oh, Fred.
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:19.600]  He hasn't got a check from the WB
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.180]  in a while.
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:22.320]  Yeah, Barney didn't make it,
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:22.760]  I'm afraid.
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:26.160]  He was really counting on the
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.720]  cameo in that Batgirl movie.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.180]  Fred Flintstone
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.220]  losing all his money in crypto feels like
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.020]  a great modern Fred Flintstone thing.
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:40.080]  Yeah, but it only happened after
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.200]  the Jetsons crossover.
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:48.740]  I'm gonna say
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:50.440]  new boot goofing guy overstaying welcome
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:51.520]  on the cam. I'm sick of him.
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.860]  Yeah, I think you're probably right.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.640]  There's American Flag clothing again.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:57.480]  Gesticulating
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.880]  wildly. I wish that was one.
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:01.900]  Ooh, we could add it.
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:02.600]  Yeah, we could.
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:04.520]  Is she Gatsby lady?
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.280]  Yeah, she's like a flapper.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.960]  And she's pissed, maybe?
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:11.020]  Oh, cop car!
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:12.240]  Nice.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.700]  I've got my line across the top.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.700]  I need someone to almost get hit by a car.
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:20.280]  It would be nice.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:22.600]  Wouldn't it be?
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.540]  Oh, selfie! Perfect. Hell yeah, I needed that too.
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.200]  Wow.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:28.320]  Oh, that gives me a bingo. Not that it matters.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:28.900]  Nice!
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:31.280]  That's still good.
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.200]  Bingo's always good.
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:35.340]  Careful, don't trip or do.
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.660]  Don't trip unless you do.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.700]  Hopefully nobody runs by
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.460]  and launches the people in front of the camera
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.660]  with a shovel. That'd be unfortunate.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.460]  Oh, Fred's back.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:47.580]  Incident.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.420]  Oh, Fred.
[01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:53.640]  There was no cowardice there.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.140]  Fred was ready.
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:04.540]  Yeah, he's got the oblivious confidence of alcohol.
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.280]  He's looking for his dinosaur.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:12.020]  Dino!
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:13.560]  Dino!
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:13.880]  Wow!
[01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:19.330]  That would be
[01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:22.010]  a wild crossover. Fred Flintstone
[01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:23.590]  in the Fast and Furious franchise
[01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:25.810]  and it's just his feet through the bottom of the car.
[01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:29.850]  Just fronted everywhere.
[01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:31.850]  Just getting all scuffed up.
[01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:33.550]  He's trying to drift.
[01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:35.970]  Get in!
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:41.680]  He's crunching.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.440]  Somebody's going to town.
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:44.980]  Who is crunching?
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:45.780]  Wasn't me.
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:48.020]  I think it's clearly Nick.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.920]  No, I'm not eating, I promise.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.640]  I had a bit of a cucumber.
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.720]  That was the loudest cucumber!
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:57.360]  Why did we have to
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.260]  go through the Rolodex of people
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:00.940]  instead of you saying I had a cucumber?
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.400]  I wanted to swallow it first.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.960]  There's a real Andrew Switch moment there, Gavin, for you.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.680]  Oh, that's why I had to jump on.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.280]  I know I got caught with some pizza earlier.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:13.920]  I had to clear my name.
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.380]  What kind of pizza did you have tonight?
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.380]  It's a pepperoni pizza
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:19.480]  with hot honey
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.280]  and a...
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.660]  Hot honey?
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:26.500]  Hot honey is becoming real popular lately.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:28.620]  It's alright.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.440]  I feel like hot honey is over
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.620]  but I could definitely see it
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:34.040]  being in a frozen pizza thing.
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.960]  Was it fresh or frozen?
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:39.620]  Fresh. Damn!
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.020]  Did you have
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:42.640]  jalapenos too?
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:46.080]  No, it had like a feta type thing.
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.040]  Oh.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:49.900]  Salty
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:50.780]  and sweet.
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:53.660]  What?
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:54.140]  What's wrong?
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:56.320]  It's so weird.
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.540]  I like food.
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.800]  Look, someone across the street sat down.
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:02.820]  Where? Oh my god!
[01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:04.200]  Holy shit!
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:07.600]  Gavin, you see things at the greatest
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.260]  of distances.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.440]  I just needed a bit of fuel.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:13.540]  Oh, the
[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:15.200]  cuke helped you.
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:17.400]  We gotta cumber this guy up.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.560]  Gavin's got cucumber eyes for the next
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.060]  few minutes.
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:23.620]  I like that when we have a snack, it's the benefits
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:24.400]  of carrot juice.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:27.560]  When we have a snack, it's
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.580]  something dog shit. When Gavin has a snack,
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.280]  it's a cucumber.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.580]  Are you starting with
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:34.860]  your carrot juice tomorrow, Andrew?
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.960]  No, I'm good.
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:38.340]  Yeah, did you finish that carrot juice?
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.880]  No. What? My favorite part
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.780]  of that episode was Andrew explaining
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.820]  over and over again that it's 100% carrot
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.780]  juice and being amazed that it tasted
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:48.160]  like carrot. He couldn't...
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.080]  There are
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.840]  like five minutes
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.720]  where you're going, now what are the ingredients
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:55.400]  in this?
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:57.500]  And you just kept looking.
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:00.740]  It's just listed as carrot.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.920]  Were you just making sure that they didn't sneak some other
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.880]  bullshit in there? I'm just curious what else, like maybe there's some sugar
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.200]  in it, maybe, I don't know.
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.240]  Is this just old carrots?
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.140]  Sugar carrots, my favorite.
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:11.360]  Yeah!
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.920]  Is the flapper?
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.160]  No.
[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:18.660]  She was giving him an air full.
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.400]  No, she seems mad.
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:21.380]  Yes.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.060]  I think it's close.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.280]  It feels like I'm trying to do
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.280]  a shitty joke here, but genuinely the only
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:32.520]  thing I'm essentially missing from my blackout
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:33.140]  is camo.
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:35.560]  I need camo as well.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:37.880]  Are those fishnets?
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:38.940]  No.
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:40.900]  Yes, they are.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.560]  They were, they absolutely were.
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:45.940]  Fuck yeah.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.440]  I can't believe how
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.360]  long this person's been sat down.
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:51.460]  Must be soaked.
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.980]  You hit a certain point of soakage.
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.500]  I think they've probably hit max soakage and it doesn't matter anymore.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.180]  Like a sheet of bounty.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:01.440]  Hehehe.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:04.480]  I just need a
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.420]  Beetlejuice costume.
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.180]  Come on, let's go.
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:10.420]  Let's go.
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:12.260]  Our one friend is mad, so it's
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:13.720]  our problem all night long.
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:15.940]  Well, you don't know what he did.
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:17.920]  Hey, you know what?
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:18.800]  Great point.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:22.440]  Got into a
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.320]  fight with Fred Flintstone a block away.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:25.480]  Yeah, you can't do that.
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.240]  Fred Flintstone could have been her dad.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:29.780]  Hahaha.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.600]  Makes sense why she's so upset.
[01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:38.990]  Tom's a girl.
[01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:42.910]  Not rich enough, Nick.
[01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:44.750]  Oh, whoops. Sorry.
[01:20:45.370 --> 01:20:46.950]  He's so much richer than that.
[01:20:47.410 --> 01:20:49.050]  He also doesn't walk around anywhere.
[01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:51.630]  He'd be on a private plane down
[01:20:51.630 --> 01:20:52.530]  Duval right now.
[01:20:54.130 --> 01:20:56.290]  Oh, look at this.
[01:20:57.170 --> 01:20:57.710]  Oh.
[01:20:57.710 --> 01:20:58.110]  Oh.
[01:20:59.450 --> 01:21:01.690]  Interesting. Overdone.
[01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:03.470]  More skeletons. Overdone.
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:09.420]  I was
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.380]  disappointed to learn that the candy we got was
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:13.340]  regular Reese's Cups and not the
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:14.780]  Halloween-shaped ones.
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:16.240]  How disappointing.
[01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:19.380]  We got a
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:21.520]  variety pack that has, like, Twix and whatever,
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:23.560]  but it has gummy
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.180]  Lifesavers and gummy
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.440]  Skittles. I don't even
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.600]  really like gummy candy. They're so
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.020]  fucking good.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.480]  I'm interested to see your arc on that, because I loved
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.580]  gummy Skittles, and then they just, I don't know,
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:36.880]  it changed. Oh, really?
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.740]  Yeah, I don't know. I was really high on them. I bought so many
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.600]  and then I was like, I don't know. Never had
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.560]  them before? They taste, they're so, like,
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.080]  Skittle-adjacent in flavor.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.440]  It's like, it's pretty uncanny.
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.580]  You ever tried the Skittle
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:51.400]  juice? Like the soda?
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:52.700]  We actually did yesterday.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.920]  Is it good? Because I just ordered some.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.120]  Nick, what do you think?
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:58.060]  Do I win?
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:21:59.200]  Yeah, it's good.
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:02.500]  Nick drank it
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.700]  and said, uh-oh.
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.400]  I said, uh-oh
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.100]  because I feel like it's
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.140]  a perfect mixer.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.140]  It is. It's so
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.080]  sweet, but in a way where you just
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.060]  go like, oh, this
[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:18.080]  does a good job. If you cut it
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.720]  with some booze, though, you wouldn't be able to tell
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.200]  it was sweet or boozy. You know what I mean?
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.160]  Like that perfect line.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.020]  Oh, they're back. Oh, wow, this guy's like
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.720]  separating them from the girls.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.420]  Who the fuck is that guy?
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.040]  Who is he supposed to be?
[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:32.680]  He's a disco guy.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:34.200]  Disco guy.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:39.040]  I want to keep watching
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:39.940]  this fight develop.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.120]  I just wish that
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.940]  their friend in a hot dog costume
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:46.040]  would show up.
[01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:54.130]  La Tida.
[01:22:54.130 --> 01:22:55.990]  La Tida. That was a fancy restaurant,
[01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:56.630]  I believe.
[01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:01.990]  La Tida. I believe it says
[01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.670]  La Tida.
[01:23:04.150 --> 01:23:05.310]  La Tida.
[01:23:07.690 --> 01:23:08.510]  La Tida.
[01:23:10.330 --> 01:23:11.430]  The other T
[01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:12.270]  rubbed off.
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:19.980]  The clones!
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:22.040]  They're so excited to see the clones.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.240]  They haven't played
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.020]  GTA 1. No,
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:26.960]  I've never played it.
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:30.140]  I don't understand. Why
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.460]  do the clones say stop?
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:34.480]  They're stop clones.
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.260]  They're like the deleted
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:39.600]  gang from the Warriors.
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:42.360]  Oh, you
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:42.980]  almost fell.
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:57.090]  Oh, she's shuffling.
[01:23:57.230 --> 01:23:59.470]  That's a pumpkin.
[01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:01.310]  Yeah, a pumpkin, right there.
[01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:05.270]  There's Eric. Whoa, look at this guy.
[01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:05.570]  Alright.
[01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:09.430]  That was Eric. The white guy with
[01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.810]  a mustache.
[01:24:11.690 --> 01:24:13.410]  We haven't seen Batman, have we?
[01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:15.410]  No. We saw him
[01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:16.170]  before we started.
[01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:19.690]  And Scooby-Doo.
[01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:20.890]  That's true.
[01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:25.210]  I hope that guy's okay
[01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:25.950]  wherever he is.
[01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:34.010]  Trip.
[01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:35.230]  We got cops moving.
[01:24:37.290 --> 01:24:37.830]  Steampunk.
[01:24:38.410 --> 01:24:39.490]  Steampunk Grandpa?
[01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:41.090]  Oh my God.
[01:24:42.730 --> 01:24:43.810]  That's awesome.
[01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:46.790]  Steampunk
[01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.970]  Pa.
[01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:49.850]  Does that count as a Pa Punk?
[01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:52.470]  I think that was a Pa Punk.
[01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:53.790]  You don't think so?
[01:24:53.890 --> 01:24:54.570]  You know what, yeah.
[01:24:56.150 --> 01:24:57.230]  Hell yeah.
[01:24:57.230 --> 01:24:58.930]  I'll give it to you
[01:24:58.930 --> 01:25:00.290]  just because we're so deep in this.
[01:25:00.930 --> 01:25:02.850]  I won't be happy about it, but I'll do it.
[01:25:02.850 --> 01:25:04.990]  40 minutes ago, I would have argued tooth and nail, baby.
[01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:07.130]  Yeah, absolutely. Eric's right.
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:13.160]  Does your dog know it's Halloween?
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:15.820]  Who are you talking to?
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:16.880]  You.
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:21.700]  I mean, we talked about it in front of him.
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:24.160]  I didn't try to keep it from him.
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:28.080]  Does your dog know what year it is?
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:30.220]  Yeah, does your dog know
[01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:30.900]  what year it is?
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:35.360]  I mean, we have a calendar
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:37.700]  in the kitchen that he can see.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:39.460]  Okay, you say so.
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.220]  Yeah, I mean, kids have been coming up
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.020]  and getting candy all night, ringing the doorbell.
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:48.180]  He's kind of got it figured out,
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:48.920]  I think.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:51.980]  Do you think
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.980]  you not getting your dog an outfit has
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:56.040]  hurt the overall chances of dog
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:56.900]  outfit tonight?
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.640]  That's a great question.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.620]  It's a very good point.
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:04.100]  Could have doomed
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.040]  myself karmically.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.920]  Oh, hell yeah. These Russian
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.060]  meerkats I follow on Instagram posted
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:14.140]  a Halloween video where the
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.020]  meerkat is wearing
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:17.120]  a sheet like a ghost.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.900]  Do you follow more animals than humans?
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.320]  It's gotta be about 50-50.
[01:26:26.250 --> 01:26:28.070]  It's gotta be near 50-50.
[01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:30.250]  I'm a big
[01:26:30.250 --> 01:26:32.290]  rock hyrax guy right now.
[01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:34.490]  Rock hyrax?
[01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:34.970]  Yeah.
[01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:37.110]  They're like,
[01:26:37.710 --> 01:26:39.510]  it's like if a...
[01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:40.270]  Jesus Christ!
[01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:42.450]  Oh my god!
[01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:45.230]  Oh my god!
[01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:48.070]  Was she hesitating or was she just drunk as shit?
[01:26:48.090 --> 01:26:50.790]  She's drunk as shit, dude.
[01:26:51.170 --> 01:26:52.230]  This chef is getting in a fight
[01:26:52.230 --> 01:26:53.010]  with this taxi.
[01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:56.170]  Did you guys see that?
[01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.850]  Oh man.
[01:26:57.570 --> 01:26:58.570]  Jesus Christ!
[01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:01.050]  Fucking too busy staring at that lady.
[01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:02.630]  Yeah.
[01:27:03.210 --> 01:27:04.730]  Sorry, rock hyrax is what?
[01:27:04.810 --> 01:27:07.470]  It's like if a Pikachu was real, kind of.
[01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:08.650]  Okay, awesome.
[01:27:09.630 --> 01:27:10.610]  It's like a little
[01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:12.910]  mouse guy that lives in the mountains
[01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:13.730]  and it goes...
[01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:14.790]  It's pretty cool.
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:19.780]  Devil.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.200]  I hope that dude puts hot dogs on the trip.
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:24.860]  Take a photo with traffic cones.
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:28.180]  Classic Satan.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:30.440]  He loves things that annoy people.
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:33.060]  Oh, that lady picked up trash.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.020]  That was nice of her.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:34.920]  Cop car.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:41.240]  Andrew, how many do you need
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:41.920]  for a blackout?
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:43.080]  Oh, it's done.
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:44.940]  Five.
[01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:48.860]  It's all of a sudden
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:50.280]  starting to look real sloppy.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.140]  There's something in that pocket.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.440]  I feel like there's been a...
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.180]  Uh-oh.
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.300]  Is that inflatable?
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:00.180]  Yeah.
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:03.760]  Across the street.
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:04.680]  I got it.
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:07.480]  I finally have a boo bingo.
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:08.920]  Well done.
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:11.400]  Jump in front of that car.
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:15.160]  Is that peanut butter?
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:16.800]  Peanut butter!
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.160]  Get in closer.
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.160]  He's got it.
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:23.820]  He got the peanut butter.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.160]  Oh my god.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:28.540]  How the fuck is the only thing
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.240]  I'm missing a Beetlejuice costume?
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.820]  The slow reveal of the jaw.
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:34.400]  Oh, what a reveal.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.680]  He did it.
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:37.380]  He's a legend.
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:40.340]  Send him a shirt.
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:41.040]  That's brilliant.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.560]  Send him something.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.540]  He gets one of those Ian pins.
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:49.660]  Absolutely insane.
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.560]  Oh my god. That guy's wearing purple
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:52.880]  and green. Those are green shorts.
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:53.980]  That's fucking purple.
[01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:56.260]  Camo, that's camo.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.000]  There's camo?
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:28:59.260]  Camo shorts.
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:01.560]  There's camo?
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:04.460]  Spitting everywhere. I'm too excited.
[01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:07.120]  Oh my god, Dan.
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:09.100]  That's so great. He's so happy.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:11.120]  Hell yeah. Take a victory lap, buddy.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.240]  I want to get a beer with this guy.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:14.680]  That's so funny.
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:16.800]  You should start a new channel with him.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.480]  It's the same thing.
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:22.260]  You don't change anything.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:24.800]  He's just a different Dan.
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:26.920]  And you, Dan
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:27.980]  dubs the voice.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:30.580]  What if it's fast mode, guys?
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:31.560]  You just do fast.
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:35.520]  What the fuck is going on now?
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:36.920]  He's making friends.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.320]  Oh my god.
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:42.800]  What the
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:43.840]  fuck?
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:47.100]  There's Bob Ross over there.
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:48.180]  On the upper right.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.020]  That's the mask. Top left.
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:52.580]  It's a Jim Carrey outfit.
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:55.260]  That's body paint.
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:57.140]  Oh, that is
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:59.200]  body paint.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.960]  Oh, Nick.
[01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:02.920]  He's okay. You're fine.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:03.620]  I flipped it.
[01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:04.060]  I flipped it.
[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:05.240]  I think you're fine.
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.720]  Yeah, okay.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:08.560]  I flipped it.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.960]  Thank you.
[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:13.960]  She also had her hands
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.440]  perfectly over the
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:17.260]  nerps there, so we're good.
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.380]  Jim Carrey.
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:22.320]  It's getting sloppy.
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.460]  Oh, that guy.
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:25.760]  He was real close.
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.280]  Fall into the bike rack.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:28.640]  Oh!
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.320]  Oh!
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:31.300]  Oh!
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:32.920]  Oh!
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:33.800]  Oh!
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.140]  Oh!
[01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:41.020]  We got him.
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:43.080]  We're good.
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:45.520]  This guy is gone.
[01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:47.440]  Holy shit.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.280]  Goodness gracious.
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.320]  He's gonna fall
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.480]  and he's not even in a costume.
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:55.840]  It's just some guy
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:56.980]  picking his nose.
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:57.520]  Oh.
[01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.800]  Gavin, is that not a buff
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:01.380]  Greg Davis?
[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:03.640]  Oh, he's getting Larry.
[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:05.920]  Out of here.
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:08.780]  He didn't fall. That was insane.
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:10.920]  That dude was like
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.560]  the spinning top in Inception.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:13.820]  We just kept waiting.
[01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:16.840]  And we don't know how it ends still.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:17.620]  Yeah.
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:19.540]  Oh.
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.440]  That was the drunkest guy I've seen on stream.
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:24.560]  That was by far
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.280]  the drunkest guy I've seen on this stream.
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:28.580]  What sucks is that he's probably
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:30.440]  facedown in the street further up the road.
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.620]  Oh, you know, remember at
[01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:34.800]  fucking eye level they're even drunker
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:36.640]  so he was, that must be
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:37.780]  insane to see in person.
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:40.600]  He's still twisting like a Beyblade. He's just out there spinning.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:46.560]  Oh.
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:50.340]  I need to almost get hit by car, clown car, trip
[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:51.480]  and separated at sidewalk.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.200]  What do I need?
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:55.500]  You just got lucky that there wasn't a car.
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:57.260]  Because he would absolutely have been
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:58.340]  almost hit by car.
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:01.220]  I need somebody to yawn. That's going to be tough.
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:03.380]  I need somebody to cry. That's going to be tough.
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:04.840]  Handshake.
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:06.020]  Oh.
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:13.960]  Nick, how many are you away?
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.140]  From a regular blackout?
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:18.880]  Uh, five.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:19.740]  Damn.
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:22.820]  But I have like the same things that you do
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:23.860]  plus two other things.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.220]  I need one more for a boo blackout
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:28.660]  and four more for a regular card blackout.
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:30.160]  Oh, you need Beetlejuice?
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:31.780]  I need Beetlejuice.
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.960]  I think we call it on either blackout.
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.080]  Yeah, I think that makes sense.
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:36.820]  That sounds fair.
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:41.680]  Dan, dress up like Beetlejuice.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:43.500]  It's been a great one though.
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:46.380]  It's been an all-time classic.
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:48.880]  Honestly, Dan has been such a great one
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.440]  because it was like, I thought this was going to be
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.720]  sloppier and crazier and it's just been
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:53.800]  sort of
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:55.820]  sparse and flaky.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:00.400]  Jesus Christ.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.140]  This is something, man.
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:05.720]  It's ended on a high note.
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:09.860]  They're not camera shy
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:11.460]  but they seem camera confused.
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.340]  When I'm old, I want a rock hard gut like that.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:16.280]  Hey man, if you start
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.740]  training now, you can get there.
[01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:22.440]  Fall, fall, fall, fall.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.120]  What's the secret to the gut success?
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:25.980]  Trippy pirate, trippy pirate, trippy pirate.
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:27.960]  Ah, you bitch.
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:30.040]  Oh, he almost did.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:32.100]  He stumbled, but he didn't trip.
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:37.700]  Somebody
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:39.140]  almost get hit by a car.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:47.420]  Ooh, honk.
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:50.340]  Everybody seems to be in a good mood tonight. Not a lot of
[01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:51.100]  fighting going on.
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:53.080]  It's true.
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:54.500]  Dude on dude's scooter.
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:56.880]  No, it's not.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:59.220]  That was dude on dude, wasn't it?
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:33:59.780]  Was it?
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:01.180]  Unclear.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.160]  I'm going to mark it.
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:06.640]  I think that's fair.
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:09.120]  We're at the point
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.260]  of not fighting about things.
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:12.920]  We're kind of supporting
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:13.980]  each other like, yeah, that looks good.
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:16.740]  My eyes are
[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:18.980]  peeled for a... I'm looking for a
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:20.860]  Beetlejuice costume so fucking
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:21.180]  bad.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.920]  I'm far more alert now about body paint
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:29.360]  as well.
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:34.940]  Well, we only seen it once, so I don't think we have to worry
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:35.640]  about it.
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:40.900]  I guess that's more of a Fantasy Fest thing,
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:41.920]  which was last week.
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:46.880]  What is Fantasy Fest?
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:49.100]  That's the thing they do every October
[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.060]  where they...
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:52.800]  We did it last year.
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:54.860]  We talked about it. It was like
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:56.780]  a big festival
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:58.680]  in the street and they have parades and everybody gets
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:00.120]  naked and it's all
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:01.660]  adult-themed.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:04.340]  Leading up to Halloween.
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.440]  Upside-down pineapples everywhere?
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:08.380]  Yeah.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:10.340]  A lot of that kind of stuff, I think.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:12.020]  Is this Bob Ross?
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:16.600]  We were looking at the camping option
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:18.120]  for a particular thing,
[01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:20.740]  as opposed to staying in a hotel or something.
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:24.400]  For this particular event,
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.600]  Amanda did a bunch
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:28.120]  of research on it and they were like,
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.840]  don't take children.
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:32.900]  There's lots of nudity
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:34.000]  and
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:36.280]  messing around
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.820]  in the open,
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:39.340]  around a big fire.
[01:35:42.630 --> 01:35:43.870]  So we're not doing that.
[01:35:44.110 --> 01:35:45.470]  Was there going to be Beetlejuice there?
[01:35:46.230 --> 01:35:49.590]  Maybe. Elvis is back.
[01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:50.090]  No!
[01:35:52.170 --> 01:35:53.170]  Not this guy.
[01:35:56.150 --> 01:35:56.730]  Good, he's leaving.
[01:36:00.450 --> 01:36:02.030]  This guy's a bit stumbly.
[01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:05.610]  He's having fun.
[01:36:06.850 --> 01:36:08.150]  He just pulled out a bottle of pills.
[01:36:09.790 --> 01:36:11.610]  Now I get it.
[01:36:12.150 --> 01:36:13.890]  He pulled out another bottle of pills.
[01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:17.930]  If you're going to sell stuff,
[01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:18.710]  go over there.
[01:36:18.810 --> 01:36:20.230]  They call him Dr. Feelgood.
[01:36:26.670 --> 01:36:27.670]  Scary hands.
[01:36:28.230 --> 01:36:28.610]  Spooky.
[01:36:30.570 --> 01:36:31.510]  Oh, fake blood.
[01:36:31.890 --> 01:36:33.310]  Oh, that's so fake blood, yeah.
[01:36:38.290 --> 01:36:39.190]  Do you have
[01:36:39.190 --> 01:36:41.030]  any garlic in the premises?
[01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:43.250]  Was that someone getting spooked, do you think?
[01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:45.050]  What's the mirror situation?
[01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:47.310]  Can I
[01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.870]  come in?
[01:36:54.210 --> 01:36:55.110]  Fuck, we gotta
[01:36:55.110 --> 01:36:56.230]  try another place.
[01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:58.050]  They said
[01:36:58.050 --> 01:36:58.590]  no.
[01:36:59.910 --> 01:37:00.850]  Saying no.
[01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:10.690]  That car
[01:37:10.690 --> 01:37:12.290]  has a fucking tribal tattoo.
[01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:13.590]  That's awesome.
[01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:16.350]  That's the most 1998
[01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:17.710]  car you can have.
[01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:20.330]  You know that
[01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:22.650]  car likes to
[01:37:22.650 --> 01:37:24.090]  play sublime songs on guitar
[01:37:24.090 --> 01:37:26.130]  in front of a fucking bonfire.
[01:37:26.130 --> 01:37:27.770]  That car has so many
[01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:29.790]  opinions about offspring albums.
[01:37:30.630 --> 01:37:32.070]  That car has a sun
[01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:33.190]  tattoo on the other side.
[01:37:41.690 --> 01:37:42.510]  I don't think
[01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:43.490]  we're getting Beetlejuice.
[01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:46.110]  This lady might fucking fall right here.
[01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:47.370]  She's not in a costume, though.
[01:37:49.110 --> 01:37:54.270]  Well, it's been a wildly successful
[01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:55.230]  evening either way.
[01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:58.430]  We had like 3,000 people
[01:37:58.430 --> 01:37:59.610]  watching, which is ridiculous.
[01:37:59.610 --> 01:38:01.690]  We won't quite get to the blackout, but man, this has been a really
[01:38:01.690 --> 01:38:03.330]  good one. This has been a lot of fun.
[01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:05.790]  Dan, congratulations.
[01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:07.110]  You're the MVP tonight.
[01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:08.970]  It really is. Undeniably.
[01:38:09.710 --> 01:38:11.110]  I thought that was really incredible.
[01:38:11.110 --> 01:38:12.390]  Dan, another handshake, man.
[01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:15.810]  I've watched it like 10 times already.
[01:38:18.230 --> 01:38:19.650]  I just keep watching
[01:38:19.650 --> 01:38:21.370]  the clip. What the fuck
[01:38:21.370 --> 01:38:23.030]  is that outfit?
[01:38:24.190 --> 01:38:24.910]  Oh, is that a popo?
[01:38:25.330 --> 01:38:25.710]  Is this guy?
[01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.430]  No,
[01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:28.590]  that guy's just cool.
[01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:31.770]  No, that's a big
[01:38:31.770 --> 01:38:32.190]  stick.
[01:38:33.650 --> 01:38:35.410]  Thanks for noticing. Mark it on your board.
[01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:36.950]  You must talk softly.
[01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:45.430]  If only we could get it
[01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:46.910]  just one more.
[01:38:47.410 --> 01:38:49.570]  We could just call it on whatever the last one we
[01:38:49.570 --> 01:38:50.350]  see is.
[01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:52.090]  It could be anything.
[01:38:52.090 --> 01:38:54.150]  It could be anything.
[01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:55.830]  People are photoshopping.
[01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:58.070]  Somebody posted on the
[01:38:58.070 --> 01:39:00.110]  subreddit, Beetlejuice and Sloppy
[01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:02.090]  Joes, and it's their dog dressed in
[01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:03.890]  a Beetlejuice costume that they
[01:39:03.890 --> 01:39:05.410]  photoshopped on the street.
[01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:07.470]  Oh, these guys are
[01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:09.030]  almost getting hit by a car.
[01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:10.250]  They're sitting in the street.
[01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:14.350]  What is this about?
[01:39:15.010 --> 01:39:16.130]  I'm marking this
[01:39:16.130 --> 01:39:17.270]  as almost got hit by a car.
[01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:19.070]  I think that's fair.
[01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:20.170]  I agree.
[01:39:20.610 --> 01:39:22.690]  What's Dan doing with these cones now?
[01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:24.450]  He found a new crew.
[01:39:25.190 --> 01:39:26.870]  He's outgrown us. He doesn't need us anymore.
[01:39:27.130 --> 01:39:28.930]  You think he's like, guys, listen.
[01:39:29.050 --> 01:39:30.990]  You guys gotta all stand in the street
[01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:32.270]  and block the cars.
[01:39:32.970 --> 01:39:34.790]  He's like, hear me out. We call a cone
[01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:36.410]  mode, guys. It's gonna be huge.
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:42.800]  Now the goal is to almost
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:44.380]  get hit, but not get hit.
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:46.620]  And go.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:49.040]  See, we can't leave on Dan.
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:50.820]  Five, six.
[01:39:58.490 --> 01:39:58.990]  Trip.
[01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:01.730]  Tripping that car.
[01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:03.350]  You tripping that car.
[01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:05.270]  You tripping the boots.
[01:40:07.170 --> 01:40:08.990]  Boots are made for tripping.
[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:15.790]  Step backwards.
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:24.960]  How come all these people are so
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.820]  much more sure-footed when they're
[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.120]  drunk than I ever was?
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:31.320]  Like...
[01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:34.260]  These guys spend a lot
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:36.620]  less time in bushes than I would be right now.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:38.180]  That guy
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:40.060]  definitely almost got hit by a car. He ran right out
[01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:43.380]  Are we getting up-cone shot?
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:45.820]  Up right?
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.200]  That's a rowdy set of cones.
[01:40:54.140 --> 01:41:01.750]  See, they're having no
[01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:02.470]  problem sitting down.
[01:41:03.050 --> 01:41:04.470]  I was thinking the same thing.
[01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:05.910]  I wasn't going to say anything, Gavin.
[01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:07.610]  Thought it the whole time.
[01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:15.300]  Oh, there's Evil Knievel.
[01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:15.820]  Evil Knievel?
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.540]  Isn't that Cleopatra, maybe?
[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:20.780]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:33.500]  Oh, what's he got?
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:34.900]  Rubbish Man!
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:37.340]  Roll a Rubbish Man!
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:41.280]  Hell yeah.
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:43.280]  I needed six.
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:45.740]  I needed three.
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.560]  Clown car separated crosswalk.
[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:50.680]  I need Camera Shy honking
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:51.320]  and crying.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:52.940]  Oh, those are my shorts.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:56.200]  So we've seen Geoff, we've seen Eric, and me now.
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:57.220]  Very nice.
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:41:58.820]  Dance party.
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:01.240]  Well guys, I think we did it.
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:03.000]  I think that's as far as we're going to get tonight.
[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:07.360]  What a great way to end it.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:08.960]  Yeah, this has been a really good one.
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:11.120]  Thanks for watching
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:13.440]  Sloppy Joe's Bingo on All Hallows Eve.
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:16.420]  Oh, awesome, awesome.
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:17.260]  Very cool.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.680]  Now they're pissing people off.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:21.600]  Oh yeah.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:23.640]  Oh my god.
[01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:28.820]  Well, thanks for watching. Go to patreon.com
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:31.020]  slash regulation pod if you want to check out
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:31.820]  more of this.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:34.740]  If you want to watch this VOD later,
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:37.000]  you can. I don't remember what day we're uploading it,
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:37.820]  but it's pretty soon.
[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:41.320]  You can let us know all the things we missed
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:43.160]  and you go, ugh, I can't believe they missed that thing.
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:43.720]  That's fine.
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:46.600]  Yeah, wonder how many Beetlejuices there were.
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:47.880]  So many.
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:49.160]  Guaranteed.
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:52.460]  We didn't really win anything, just the opportunity
[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:54.440]  to go buy our own cake.
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:57.040]  Yeah, and this was a
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:58.420]  fun ass Sloppy Joe's.
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:00.540]  This was a fun one.
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.920]  Hope you guys had fun watching it.
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:04.780]  Check out the podcast, check out the gameplay channels.
[01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:06.500]  We have a lot of stuff.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.500]  We have a stream here tomorrow
[01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:10.640]  at 4pm central
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:12.080]  that involves you.
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:14.800]  We're going to be playing Trivial Pursuit 2
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:16.820]  with you,
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:18.760]  the audience.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.460]  Andrew, how does that work?
[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:22.180]  They'll be able to input
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:24.600]  guesses to questions and it'll be us
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:25.760]  against them, essentially.
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:28.280]  Bone up on your trivia audience.
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:30.440]  You'll just be able to enter responses
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:31.420]  in the chat.
[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:33.120]  Don't point at us, point at you.
[01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:35.380]  Don't point at us,
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:36.160]  point at you.
[01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:38.800]  So there you go, guys. Thanks for watching.
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:40.900]  This has been Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.940]  Dan, thank you, Dan.
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:44.180]  Bye, Dan.
[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:46.420]  Way to go, Dan. Thanks for double fisting.
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:49.140]  I thought he was going for it.
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:49.940]  Way to go, Dan.
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:51.760]  Bye.
[01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:54.160]  Bye, Dan.
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:54.600]  Bye.
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:01.500]  Keep going.
