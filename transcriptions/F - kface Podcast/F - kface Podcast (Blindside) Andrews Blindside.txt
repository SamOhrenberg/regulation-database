[00:10.180 --> 00:12.640]  Okay, and then this is the audio sync countdown.
[00:14.960 --> 00:19.460]  5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
[00:19.460 --> 00:21.980]  Zero, and it doesn't matter,
[00:22.220 --> 00:23.940]  because this is a blindside!
[00:24.240 --> 00:26.160]  Y'all get blindsided!
[00:26.660 --> 00:27.860]  This is a blindside!
[00:28.180 --> 00:29.660]  I was really excited for Tony Hawk.
[00:29.800 --> 00:30.740]  Oh, I was so excited.
[00:31.140 --> 00:32.840]  We're going to do Tony Hawk some other time.
[00:33.280 --> 00:35.620]  I'm here with a blindside on you guys.
[00:35.680 --> 00:37.120]  We're going to watch an episode of a show.
[00:37.120 --> 00:39.880]  Not that it has to be this for a blindside,
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.360]  but I wanted to share a weird piece of Canadian history
[00:44.880 --> 00:46.060]  with all y'all.
[00:46.260 --> 00:47.100]  Eric, I'm going to send you a link
[00:47.100 --> 00:48.360]  if you wouldn't mind sharing this,
[00:48.440 --> 00:50.340]  because you know how to do this.
[00:50.400 --> 00:50.820]  Yeah, sure.
[00:50.920 --> 00:51.860]  An episode of a show.
[00:52.100 --> 00:54.780]  We are going to watch a Canadian staple,
[00:54.980 --> 00:58.180]  a Canadian classic, one of an all-time episode
[00:58.180 --> 01:02.400]  of The Littlest Hobo, everyone's favorite TV show.
[01:02.540 --> 01:03.140]  Excuse me?
[01:04.000 --> 01:05.620]  The Littlest Hobo.
[01:05.620 --> 01:08.340]  I don't know if you're allowed to say that,
[01:08.480 --> 01:09.060]  but all right, sure.
[01:09.540 --> 01:11.480]  How long is The Littlest Hobo?
[01:11.880 --> 01:12.860]  22 minutes.
[01:13.080 --> 01:14.880]  Yeah, 23 minutes, 45 seconds.
[01:15.160 --> 01:17.540]  Do you have time for The Littlest Hobo?
[01:17.980 --> 01:19.520]  It's just a little bit of The Littlest Hobo.
[01:19.840 --> 01:22.340]  Oh my God, is it like frickin' Lassie?
[01:23.160 --> 01:24.720]  It's so it's a dog show,
[01:24.740 --> 01:28.560]  and every episode the dog saves people and helps problems.
[01:28.680 --> 01:31.480]  This actually, I believe, is where Mike Myers got his start.
[01:31.740 --> 01:33.160]  He's in an episode of this.
[01:33.780 --> 01:37.520]  One of the greatest TV show themes you will ever hear.
[01:38.160 --> 01:38.420]  Okay.
[01:38.580 --> 01:41.600]  So this is like Skippy the Wonder Kangaroo or whatever.
[01:41.780 --> 01:42.340]  The Bush Kangaroo.
[01:42.800 --> 01:44.520]  Exactly, whatever that is, yes.
[01:45.120 --> 01:47.720]  This is season one, episode 16, snapshot.
[01:48.160 --> 01:52.220]  It is, I think, a fantastic view of shitty parenting
[01:52.220 --> 01:55.660]  in the 80s and like what is viewed as essential.
[01:56.440 --> 01:58.020]  And it's just, it's a wild ride
[01:58.020 --> 01:59.500]  that I'm excited to share with you guys.
[01:59.640 --> 02:01.280]  I was so excited for Tony Hawk.
[02:01.520 --> 02:02.760]  I've been playing Tony Hawk.
[02:02.760 --> 02:05.300]  That was the perfect amount of time between blindsides.
[02:05.360 --> 02:06.180]  It really was.
[02:06.360 --> 02:07.320]  I didn't even consider it.
[02:07.640 --> 02:09.060]  I'm so impressed with you, Andrew.
[02:09.520 --> 02:10.860]  Yeah, I gotta be honest.
[02:11.020 --> 02:13.820]  I don't think I could be more blindsided than I am right now.
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.240]  You waited just long enough that I forgot
[02:16.240 --> 02:17.160]  that that was a thing we did.
[02:17.160 --> 02:18.440]  You said it's a blindside
[02:18.440 --> 02:20.580]  and I immediately needed to piss for some reason.
[02:23.920 --> 02:24.320]  Yeah.
[02:24.320 --> 02:25.700]  Okay, you guys ready for the littlest hobo?
[02:26.080 --> 02:26.660]  Oh, I'm ready.
[02:27.040 --> 02:27.300]  Yeah.
[02:27.540 --> 02:28.260]  Okay, here it comes.
[02:29.260 --> 02:30.420]  How many seasons did they have?
[02:30.960 --> 02:32.460]  Like four or five, I wanna say.
[02:32.960 --> 02:33.700]  Wow, too many.
[02:33.880 --> 02:34.780]  All right, I'm hitting play.
[02:34.780 --> 02:35.520]  Oh, it's great.
[02:36.020 --> 02:38.800]  This is the littlest hobo season one episode 16 snapshot.
[02:40.060 --> 02:42.740]  Three, two, one, play.
[02:43.500 --> 02:44.160]  Can you hear that?
[02:44.700 --> 02:45.760]  Oh yeah, we can.
[02:46.460 --> 02:48.420]  Is the dog flying the helicopter?
[02:49.040 --> 02:50.500]  Yeah, I would like to assume so.
[02:50.860 --> 02:51.460]  In the room.
[02:52.540 --> 02:54.200]  Oh, he's being blinded.
[02:54.640 --> 02:56.200]  This is really cool
[02:56.200 --> 02:58.520]  because I don't know if Gracie knows what a blindside is.
[02:58.780 --> 03:00.720]  So she's really flying blind here.
[03:02.900 --> 03:04.680]  Andrew has just hit us with something
[03:04.680 --> 03:06.060]  that we didn't think we were gonna watch
[03:06.060 --> 03:06.880]  and now we have to.
[03:07.280 --> 03:09.140]  So that's a blindside.
[03:09.440 --> 03:10.060]  Welcome to it.
[03:10.760 --> 03:12.640]  Yeah, this is only the second time it's ever happened,
[03:12.800 --> 03:17.340]  Gracie, and we're just as surprised as you are.
[03:17.440 --> 03:17.580]  Yeah.
[03:17.900 --> 03:20.300]  I think I've used this editing template
[03:20.300 --> 03:21.320]  in Windows Movie Maker.
[03:23.400 --> 03:25.740]  Oh my God, he's got a gun!
[03:26.500 --> 03:28.140]  There's an active shooter in the field.
[03:28.220 --> 03:29.160]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[03:30.140 --> 03:32.060]  Geoff, do you remember when every show
[03:32.060 --> 03:34.460]  just had the longest intro you've ever seen?
[03:34.960 --> 03:35.500]  Yes, I do.
[03:35.720 --> 03:36.600]  Yes, I do.
[03:38.700 --> 03:39.700]  Santa Rice!
[03:40.960 --> 03:42.880]  Because it's Canadian, it has to be hockey related.
[03:45.640 --> 03:46.240]  Wow.
[03:46.960 --> 03:48.940]  So what year did we determine this is?
[03:49.260 --> 03:49.860]  1980.
[03:50.480 --> 03:51.040]  1980.
[03:51.720 --> 03:53.020]  Maybe shot in 79.
[03:54.100 --> 03:54.280]  Yeah.
[03:54.740 --> 03:57.080]  Shot with one big floodlight pointed at children.
[03:57.100 --> 04:00.780]  So this is 43, 44 years ago.
[04:07.360 --> 04:08.620]  Is that the dog up there?
[04:08.660 --> 04:09.540]  That's the dog, yeah.
[04:10.140 --> 04:11.460]  He just walks into scenarios.
[04:11.820 --> 04:13.640]  He just walks in!
[04:15.640 --> 04:17.340]  It's Quantum Leap, but with a dog.
[04:17.860 --> 04:22.060]  Does he belong to anybody?
[04:22.140 --> 04:24.180]  No, he does not.
[04:25.000 --> 04:26.880]  He just calls them Snapshot for some reason.
[04:27.360 --> 04:28.920]  It's the dog would go to different groups
[04:28.920 --> 04:30.480]  and has no relation to any of these people.
[04:30.660 --> 04:32.680]  Well, so he has a different name depending on who he sees.
[04:33.440 --> 04:35.020]  I don't think it's continuous.
[04:35.880 --> 04:38.380]  It looks like Peter Billingsley from A Christmas Story.
[04:38.600 --> 04:39.620]  It does!
[04:39.820 --> 04:41.400]  Like the Canadian Christmas Story.
[04:41.800 --> 04:41.900]  A.
[04:42.420 --> 04:43.980]  Andrew, can I ask you a question?
[04:44.580 --> 04:44.840]  Yeah.
[04:45.180 --> 04:45.960]  Does this kid have AIDS?
[04:46.620 --> 04:47.000]  No.
[04:47.440 --> 04:47.880]  Oh, OK.
[04:48.780 --> 04:49.360]  No AIDS.
[04:50.960 --> 04:53.480]  But his mom's real mad because he's missing hockey.
[04:55.580 --> 04:56.040]  Whoa!
[04:56.240 --> 04:56.800]  Whoa!
[04:57.460 --> 04:57.520]  Jeez!
[04:58.040 --> 04:58.880]  What the hell?
[05:08.610 --> 05:09.630]  Oh my God!
[05:09.630 --> 05:10.830]  Oh my Lord!
[05:11.210 --> 05:12.590]  The other guy's face!
[05:12.990 --> 05:14.010]  What the fuck?
[05:14.330 --> 05:14.950]  Is it?
[05:15.170 --> 05:17.550]  It looks like this kid's about to hit her with a 2x4.
[05:19.290 --> 05:20.170]  It's foreshadowing.
[05:24.980 --> 05:26.500]  She's barely getting the words out.
[05:27.140 --> 05:27.580]  Jesus.
[05:28.520 --> 05:30.360]  The coach is like, yeah, she's crazy.
[05:30.860 --> 05:31.120]  Wow.
[05:31.400 --> 05:33.500]  They were like, first take's good enough.
[05:36.320 --> 05:37.740]  Will you be my dad, dog?
[05:41.480 --> 05:44.440]  I like that the coach doesn't even wonder where the dog came from.
[05:44.440 --> 05:45.260]  This is OK.
[05:45.800 --> 05:48.540]  So they didn't have to pay residuals to that coach at all.
[05:48.780 --> 05:50.300]  He didn't open his fucking mouth once.
[05:52.380 --> 05:54.500]  I've noticed that in Dallas a lot.
[05:55.180 --> 05:56.600]  Didn't he say something before the kid showed up?
[05:56.680 --> 05:57.040]  He did.
[05:57.220 --> 05:58.100]  He has one line.
[05:59.000 --> 05:59.560]  He's getting paid.
[05:59.680 --> 05:59.960]  That's all it takes.
[06:00.260 --> 06:01.540]  He's probably 80 now.
[06:02.100 --> 06:02.880]  Probably still getting checks.
[06:03.100 --> 06:04.600]  I wonder if he's getting a check because we're watching it right now.
[06:04.900 --> 06:05.520]  Fuck no.
[06:06.100 --> 06:06.360]  Nope.
[06:09.180 --> 06:09.740]  Kill her.
[06:09.940 --> 06:10.260]  Add.
[06:10.440 --> 06:10.960]  Kill your mother.
[06:12.240 --> 06:13.680]  Hey, kid, wanna find a gun?
[06:18.560 --> 06:20.640]  So it's like a neighborhood dog.
[06:21.480 --> 06:23.280]  No, he travels the country.
[06:24.560 --> 06:27.500]  Oh, so it's like David Carradine in Kung Fu?
[06:27.500 --> 06:27.920]  He's the littlest hobo.
[06:28.520 --> 06:28.780]  Yes.
[06:29.380 --> 06:33.340]  OK, he's like the Incredible Hulk in the 70s.
[06:33.580 --> 06:34.040]  Yes.
[06:34.300 --> 06:36.540]  Oh, it's for Citibank.
[06:37.620 --> 06:39.960]  What if Macaulay Culkin was just walking the other way?
[06:41.700 --> 06:43.060]  Two very different adventures.
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.500]  So was that the kid's mom that was so hateful?
[06:48.700 --> 06:48.960]  Yes.
[06:50.360 --> 06:55.960]  She's mad because he likes photography and he's not into skating and he doesn't have courage because he's not playing hockey.
[06:56.840 --> 06:59.880]  Is it looked down upon in Canada if you don't like hockey or skating?
[07:00.520 --> 07:02.360]  I don't... normal people, no.
[07:03.020 --> 07:03.500]  OK.
[07:03.500 --> 07:12.060]  I think his dad died is supposed to be the implication and he was a big hockey player. Super jock?
[07:12.160 --> 07:13.140]  Super jock, yeah.
[07:13.340 --> 07:13.760]  Yeah.
[07:15.520 --> 07:21.560]  He's just like, I need a place to stay, so walk into this bank that's door is open for some reason in the middle of the night.
[07:22.820 --> 07:25.660]  Very well groomed dog for being a little hobo.
[07:26.220 --> 07:27.920]  He takes care of himself.
[07:31.600 --> 07:33.760]  Is that the music or has he got a bag full of bottles?
[07:36.200 --> 07:38.480]  You stole all of their silverware?
[07:42.960 --> 07:45.340]  It's neither, Gavin. You're about to see what it is.
[07:49.430 --> 07:51.330]  It sounds like he's about to rob a bank.
[07:51.670 --> 07:52.370]  That's Andy Dufresne.
[07:54.150 --> 07:56.330]  The dog's going to go get his gun and help him out.
[08:02.130 --> 08:08.350]  At what point do you just stop and leave? I would not be continuing to pursue whatever this is.
[08:08.630 --> 08:10.930]  I would have looked at the doors made of wood and turned around.
[08:11.670 --> 08:11.950]  Yeah.
[08:13.930 --> 08:16.330]  Is this kid going to see a bank robbery happening?
[08:17.610 --> 08:22.270]  It's very possible. But if he does, at least the littlest hobo is here to help him.
[08:22.750 --> 08:25.350]  Why did you pick this specific episode?
[08:25.890 --> 08:29.110]  Because it's wild. It is an insane episode.
[08:29.650 --> 08:32.470]  Had you seen it before you decided for it on Blindside?
[08:33.490 --> 08:34.050]  Yes.
[08:34.450 --> 08:36.890]  Oh, shit. That guy's face got covered.
[08:37.530 --> 08:38.990]  They are robbing a bank.
[08:41.130 --> 08:42.590]  That guy got danger pay.
[08:46.960 --> 08:48.140]  The green stuff.
[08:49.600 --> 08:51.600]  Is this show supposed to be American?
[08:53.300 --> 08:54.760]  I... no, I don't think so.
[08:55.200 --> 08:57.620]  But, I mean, you wouldn't call your money the green stuff.
[08:58.640 --> 09:01.860]  Well, there was a time in which it wasn't colored in the same way.
[09:02.360 --> 09:03.540]  Oh, really? Oh, I didn't know that.
[09:04.300 --> 09:06.520]  How are they getting sparks out of a concrete brick?
[09:09.800 --> 09:11.740]  Did he kill his dad? What's happening?
[09:14.240 --> 09:14.640]  Foreshadowing.
[09:14.800 --> 09:15.940]  What if that's his dad? What if that is his dad?
[09:16.320 --> 09:18.120]  He thought he was dead this whole time.
[09:19.780 --> 09:20.900]  Oh, my God.
[09:23.940 --> 09:26.540]  See how he was whistling there to distract the kid?
[09:26.720 --> 09:28.940]  If it were me, it would have been the A-Team theme song.
[09:30.680 --> 09:31.780]  Quick, weld him, Jimmy.
[09:35.780 --> 09:37.740]  We're gonna weld your mouth shut.
[09:40.300 --> 09:41.360]  Hobo just observing.
[09:41.880 --> 09:43.360]  Someone pet me? Oh, here he goes.
[09:43.660 --> 09:45.160]  He's a tails wagon. He approves.
[09:46.720 --> 09:48.100]  I hate children.
[09:51.000 --> 09:52.080]  Oh, dog cam.
[09:52.740 --> 09:54.640]  You love a show with a dog cam.
[09:54.740 --> 09:55.760]  I love dog cam.
[10:02.960 --> 10:04.700]  Too much, like, work.
[10:07.720 --> 10:09.260]  He has a Slim Jim in his pocket.
[10:13.880 --> 10:15.940]  He's trying to be sneaky. He's trying to untie the kid.
[10:16.280 --> 10:17.500]  Come on, Hobo, you can do it.
[10:18.360 --> 10:18.760]  Nope.
[10:21.460 --> 10:23.580]  Did the show end because London died?
[10:24.460 --> 10:26.940]  I don't know. I assume ratings.
[10:27.780 --> 10:31.160]  I'm sure if you go to later seasons, the dog's called Paris or something.
[10:33.080 --> 10:34.380]  Starring London, too.
[10:41.460 --> 10:43.220]  I don't know why they're trying to weld through brick.
[10:43.640 --> 10:44.640]  That's a great point, Gavin.
[10:45.220 --> 10:47.520]  They're just like cutting a hole through the back of the vault.
[10:49.500 --> 10:51.300]  That's the Sam Fisher dog right there.
[10:51.460 --> 10:52.920]  He knows where the shadows are.
[10:57.980 --> 10:59.060]  Oh, he's getting out.
[11:00.400 --> 11:01.920]  Is the kid going to choke him with the rope?
[11:02.580 --> 11:05.120]  He's like, hey, come on, let's get out of here.
[11:06.600 --> 11:07.000]  Bye.
[11:09.380 --> 11:10.660]  This dog is sneaky.
[11:11.240 --> 11:12.460]  Oh, it's a very sneaky dog.
[11:13.300 --> 11:14.980]  He's well traveled by this point.
[11:15.940 --> 11:17.160]  I bet this dog's good at Hitman.
[11:17.820 --> 11:19.180]  Oh, he's great at Hitman.
[11:22.330 --> 11:24.930]  It's also such a weird design for what should be a bank.
[11:25.450 --> 11:25.730]  Yeah.
[11:26.870 --> 11:31.090]  It's like they had a set somewhere and just started putting pieces up and went, bank.
[11:32.410 --> 11:33.950]  They got a free night at the leisure center.
[11:35.430 --> 11:39.930]  How many episodes do you think we'd have to watch before we saw this stairwell as something else?
[11:40.330 --> 11:41.890]  One other episode.
[11:51.790 --> 11:54.010]  There's only one door and it's made of chipboard.
[11:59.250 --> 12:00.850]  Oh, 80s carnival glass.
[12:02.290 --> 12:06.830]  I feel like we're at the point where if you see a building with that in it, it should be knocked down by now.
[12:08.250 --> 12:09.050]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:09.590 --> 12:11.310]  It probably has asbestos.
[12:11.390 --> 12:13.450]  Yeah, hand in hand.
[12:18.560 --> 12:22.220]  There's a lot of the Midwest of America that needs to be knocked down right now, unfortunately.
[12:22.780 --> 12:23.180]  Oh, yeah.
[12:24.580 --> 12:29.320]  I'd say about fucking 30% of the houses I look for, I look at it just to get rid of it.
[12:30.120 --> 12:31.740]  Copious amounts of that shit in it.
[12:32.940 --> 12:33.800]  Oh, shit!
[12:34.020 --> 12:34.480]  Oh, kid!
[12:36.120 --> 12:36.920]  You suck!
[12:37.180 --> 12:39.760]  My glasses!
[12:43.520 --> 12:45.680]  Velma ass kid, get out of here.
[12:46.640 --> 12:48.660]  Oh shit, now he looks like the 2x4 kid.
[12:49.400 --> 12:50.320]  Now it's Kid Cam.
[12:54.460 --> 12:56.740]  Do you guys not have commercials?
[12:58.600 --> 13:00.740]  I assume they were edited out, we definitely do.
[13:01.160 --> 13:03.780]  But I mean, there hasn't been a place for a commercial break.
[13:04.360 --> 13:05.240]  They don't care.
[13:05.480 --> 13:06.940]  Right now, Tiny Hippos!
[13:10.960 --> 13:11.920]  That zoom!
[13:15.180 --> 13:16.740]  This guy's corrupt.
[13:17.640 --> 13:18.440]  Yeah, he's a bad cop.
[13:19.060 --> 13:21.460]  Do you think that corrupt cop is his dad?
[13:23.940 --> 13:25.000]  Can't rule it out.
[13:26.000 --> 13:26.960]  This dog!
[13:27.600 --> 13:30.380]  Did he call the littlest hobo Slapshot earlier?
[13:30.580 --> 13:31.080]  Is that what he called him?
[13:31.140 --> 13:31.980]  Snapshot, I believe.
[13:32.600 --> 13:33.980]  Oh, because he's a photographer.
[13:34.380 --> 13:35.080]  That makes sense.
[13:35.640 --> 13:37.540]  And because it said in big text at the beginning.
[13:38.220 --> 13:39.580]  What'd you do that for?
[13:40.240 --> 13:41.140]  Are they on the roof?
[13:43.040 --> 13:47.740]  No, they're in the entrance where I guess the bank is being constructed.
[13:48.260 --> 13:50.300]  What the hell's going on?
[13:50.780 --> 13:52.280]  This kid gets tied up a lot.
[13:52.800 --> 13:53.860]  He's tying the kid up.
[13:53.940 --> 13:54.720]  He's a corrupt cop.
[13:55.100 --> 13:55.860]  That's what you guys call him.
[13:57.340 --> 13:58.240]  ACAB, dude, you know.
[14:03.880 --> 14:07.060]  What kind of dog is the littlest hobo?
[14:07.740 --> 14:08.960]  I think a German Shepherd, right?
[14:09.380 --> 14:10.300]  I don't know.
[14:10.620 --> 14:12.340]  He looks like part German Shepherd.
[14:12.560 --> 14:14.200]  I think he's...
[14:14.200 --> 14:16.260]  What's the plan with this cop and this kid?
[14:16.280 --> 14:16.780]  He's seen him.
[14:16.820 --> 14:18.160]  He's gonna have to slit his throat later.
[14:18.360 --> 14:19.260]  Jesus Christ!
[14:19.820 --> 14:20.080]  Yeah.
[14:21.040 --> 14:22.160]  I think that's the plan.
[14:22.640 --> 14:27.940]  Maybe they're planning on tying him up and throwing him in the bank and then pinning the whole robbery on him.
[14:29.020 --> 14:31.840]  As some sort of evil boy genius.
[14:32.640 --> 14:34.200]  That's why he's always late to practice.
[14:39.340 --> 14:40.180]  Not a great sentence.
[14:43.900 --> 14:44.380]  Dummies.
[14:50.380 --> 14:53.620]  For bank robbers, these guys are doing a lot of not robbing banks.
[14:54.720 --> 14:56.180]  Just a lot of talking in hallways.
[14:57.200 --> 14:57.620]  $18?
[15:00.360 --> 15:01.560]  He's slipping all around.
[15:02.120 --> 15:03.000]  Was it a flashlight?
[15:04.560 --> 15:05.340]  I think so.
[15:05.380 --> 15:07.200]  You think he wouldn't have to pay for that, though?
[15:07.780 --> 15:08.720]  Yeah, no kidding.
[15:08.980 --> 15:11.340]  You feel like they would have filmed that bit.
[15:22.390 --> 15:23.110]  He's yelling.
[15:23.290 --> 15:24.170]  He's fucking corrupt.
[15:25.150 --> 15:26.230]  Don't trust him, George.
[15:28.010 --> 15:30.890]  If this dog was so fucking smart, why doesn't he learn how to bark English?
[15:32.150 --> 15:32.570]  Idiot.
[15:32.810 --> 15:33.230]  Trapped.
[15:33.590 --> 15:33.970]  Child.
[15:34.630 --> 15:34.910]  Yeah.
[15:37.630 --> 15:39.530]  He said shoe, and that worked.
[15:41.190 --> 15:42.430]  My one weakness.
[15:46.210 --> 15:49.510]  The dog had, like, the icon to the men's room on his chin there.
[15:49.530 --> 15:49.970]  Did you see that?
[15:50.570 --> 15:50.970]  No.
[15:51.710 --> 15:52.510]  I didn't.
[15:57.640 --> 15:59.060]  I mean, he's really trying.
[15:59.600 --> 16:00.880]  He's doing his best to help this kid.
[16:01.240 --> 16:01.640]  Oh, no.
[16:02.280 --> 16:03.280]  Slowly, pan.
[16:04.620 --> 16:05.500]  Slowly, pan.
[16:05.780 --> 16:06.160]  Nothing.
[16:06.380 --> 16:07.200]  The kid is gone.
[16:07.920 --> 16:08.220]  Okay.
[16:08.400 --> 16:08.820]  There we go.
[16:09.300 --> 16:10.240]  First commercial break.
[16:10.360 --> 16:10.760]  We're back.
[16:11.600 --> 16:14.500]  Do you think that commercial was of a tiny hippo?
[16:14.520 --> 16:15.240]  It must have been.
[16:15.660 --> 16:15.840]  Yeah.
[16:20.540 --> 16:21.420]  Fucking cops.
[16:23.000 --> 16:24.240]  I just saw his wiener.
[16:25.940 --> 16:26.760]  There it is.
[16:31.320 --> 16:32.240]  I like this show.
[16:32.260 --> 16:33.400]  I like the dog, honestly.
[16:33.680 --> 16:33.820]  I do, too.
[16:33.840 --> 16:34.860]  The dog is great.
[16:35.540 --> 16:37.500]  The dog's not getting...
[16:37.500 --> 16:38.620]  He's not stealing the show.
[16:39.560 --> 16:40.720]  He's a modest dog.
[16:41.180 --> 16:43.100]  This is as good as Mr. Belvedere, I think.
[16:44.480 --> 16:45.100]  I agree.
[16:45.260 --> 16:45.800]  I'd hope so.
[16:45.900 --> 16:46.220]  It's good.
[16:46.320 --> 16:47.000]  It builds.
[16:47.400 --> 16:48.280]  Dude, we're going places.
[16:48.500 --> 16:49.400]  He's ringing doorbells?
[16:49.480 --> 16:50.460]  An invisible doorbell?
[16:50.880 --> 16:52.900]  Is he bringing this to the mom that hates her kid?
[16:53.320 --> 16:54.220]  Yes, he is.
[16:55.320 --> 16:56.340]  That is an ugly door.
[16:57.920 --> 17:01.320]  She's going to get there and be like, if you had half the courage, you'd beat up those
[17:01.320 --> 17:01.940]  robbers.
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.960]  Your dad would have slapshotted them to death.
[17:07.380 --> 17:09.240]  Why is she dressed from a different century?
[17:11.920 --> 17:13.200]  I looked it up.
[17:13.500 --> 17:18.900]  The Littlest Hobo is a Canadian television series, French title, Le Vagabond, based on
[17:18.900 --> 17:23.160]  a 1959 well-known movie by the same name.
[17:23.280 --> 17:23.780]  Oh, what?
[17:25.780 --> 17:26.400]  Dang.
[17:27.080 --> 17:29.160]  It was on from 1979 to 1985.
[17:29.980 --> 17:34.160]  The concept of the show was that of, quote, an ownerless dog.
[17:36.860 --> 17:38.160]  He's a German shepherd.
[17:38.740 --> 17:39.340]  That is the dog.
[17:44.920 --> 17:45.900]  I'm looking at trivia.
[17:46.180 --> 17:47.920]  This series is a modern day Western.
[17:48.340 --> 17:53.000]  Hobo, whose background, origins, motivation and ultimate destination are never explained,
[17:53.360 --> 17:56.100]  wanders from town to town and befriends those who need help.
[17:56.280 --> 18:00.700]  At the end of each episode, despite the people he helped attempting to adopt him, he would
[18:00.700 --> 18:02.780]  head off by himself, preferring to be on his own.
[18:03.400 --> 18:04.160]  I'm a loner, Dotty.
[18:04.300 --> 18:04.760]  A rebel.
[18:06.560 --> 18:12.660]  Like, so he's Clint Eastwood in, like, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly or whatever, where
[18:12.660 --> 18:15.500]  he's like the nameless guy, like the blonde guy.
[18:15.860 --> 18:17.800]  Like, he's just going from town to town.
[18:18.300 --> 18:18.920]  That's awesome.
[18:19.400 --> 18:21.060]  Did I bark five times or six?
[18:24.620 --> 18:25.020]  What?
[18:25.100 --> 18:25.880]  What happened to these guys?
[18:26.060 --> 18:26.620]  They're going to do what?
[18:26.800 --> 18:27.960]  To my kid fingering it?
[18:27.960 --> 18:28.460]  Did he try?
[18:32.460 --> 18:40.960]  Plots ranged from the simple, quote, dog helps person story to secret agent type adventures.
[18:41.380 --> 18:41.680]  Yup.
[18:42.320 --> 18:43.480]  In those places.
[18:45.660 --> 18:48.600]  I think they're talking about if they're going to kill the kid or not, and the consensus
[18:48.600 --> 18:50.180]  is yes, we have to kill the kid.
[18:51.920 --> 18:53.240]  Where's the James Brown crossover?
[18:54.920 --> 18:56.840]  Oh, I hope they don't look right.
[18:58.040 --> 18:59.000]  You're fucked.
[18:59.280 --> 19:07.560]  In season five's two part episode, The Genesis Tapes, a scientist and reporter theorized
[19:07.560 --> 19:10.980]  that Hobo was a type of superior canine.
[19:11.320 --> 19:17.580]  The reporter theorized that there was one dog and the scientist theorized that there
[19:17.580 --> 19:20.360]  were up to 100 such dogs.
[19:21.620 --> 19:22.300]  What?
[19:22.420 --> 19:23.700]  What are they doing to him?
[19:23.800 --> 19:24.980]  We're getting, it's getting serious.
[19:25.320 --> 19:27.160]  Is that how that show Orphan Black happened?
[19:27.420 --> 19:28.220]  Yeah, exactly.
[19:28.620 --> 19:31.180]  So what was the mom saying to follow the dog?
[19:32.280 --> 19:36.420]  She was just like, if he thinks I'm going to back down from being mad at him, there's
[19:36.420 --> 19:36.840]  no way.
[19:37.760 --> 19:39.160]  They're going to kill this kid.
[19:39.860 --> 19:40.940]  That's what we're watching.
[19:41.100 --> 19:42.880]  They're going to chuck him down the lift shaft?
[19:42.940 --> 19:44.080]  They're going to throw him down an elevator shaft.
[19:44.200 --> 19:45.260]  Oh my God.
[19:46.060 --> 19:46.460]  Jesus.
[19:46.660 --> 19:47.980]  There's no way this was safe to film.
[19:48.100 --> 19:48.700]  Oh my God.
[19:53.220 --> 19:53.840]  He's right.
[20:00.010 --> 20:00.910]  Just toss him.
[20:00.990 --> 20:01.890]  Stop talking to him.
[20:09.490 --> 20:12.510]  They're going to kill this kid.
[20:12.750 --> 20:13.590]  Oh my God.
[20:15.030 --> 20:16.910]  Man, Canada does not fuck around.
[20:17.430 --> 20:18.250]  They do not.
[20:18.810 --> 20:19.870]  This guy in the blue.
[20:20.010 --> 20:21.670]  Oh, he stole his glasses so he can't see.
[20:22.030 --> 20:22.490]  Oh shit.
[20:23.690 --> 20:26.190]  Now people would believe that he fell down because he couldn't see.
[20:26.570 --> 20:27.650]  Well, at least he won't see it coming.
[20:28.410 --> 20:29.230]  Oh no, a dog bark.
[20:30.910 --> 20:31.870]  What's happening now?
[20:33.090 --> 20:34.010]  Oh, hell of a zoom.
[20:34.070 --> 20:34.390]  Oh, did you see that?
[20:34.390 --> 20:36.130]  He didn't stick the landing, but it was a good effort.
[20:40.170 --> 20:41.950]  It's like Grand Central Station over here.
[20:42.610 --> 20:44.810]  This poor kid getting shoved all around.
[20:44.830 --> 20:45.890]  This is manhandled.
[20:46.150 --> 20:47.590]  He can't see anything.
[20:54.930 --> 20:58.950]  I appreciate what Hobo's trying to do here, but I don't feel like bringing the mom into
[20:58.950 --> 21:01.230]  this environment is maybe the best idea.
[21:02.390 --> 21:03.470]  Kicking her in the box.
[21:05.950 --> 21:08.410]  The dog's just going to get us shoved down a different lift shaft.
[21:10.670 --> 21:14.590]  They're going to put the glasses on the dog and say...
[21:14.590 --> 21:15.710]  Yeah, call the police.
[21:18.790 --> 21:21.830]  I followed the dog to this place, I might as well just see it through.
[21:24.890 --> 21:25.810]  Get him, Hobo.
[21:26.410 --> 21:27.610]  Bite his dick off.
[21:28.190 --> 21:31.150]  He's going in, he's trying to figure out where the kid is.
[21:47.820 --> 21:48.220]  Unnecessary?
[21:48.820 --> 21:49.520]  She's angry.
[21:50.540 --> 21:52.340]  Kid's stupid, dog's stupid.
[21:52.960 --> 21:56.040]  Tomorrow, she's going to be like, yeah, I went into this building and this stupid cop
[21:56.040 --> 21:56.680]  hung up the phone.
[21:59.920 --> 22:01.580]  Oh, he's going to throw him down the shaft now.
[22:02.420 --> 22:03.020]  Run, kid!
[22:03.280 --> 22:04.060]  No, he can't see shit.
[22:04.740 --> 22:05.780]  He can't see shit.
[22:07.480 --> 22:07.940]  Oh, no!
[22:08.720 --> 22:09.480]  Oh, no!
[22:11.420 --> 22:12.140]  Save him!
[22:12.140 --> 22:13.980]  Oh, shit!
[22:17.720 --> 22:18.900]  He's fucking dead.
[22:19.080 --> 22:19.340]  Fuck!
[22:19.780 --> 22:21.220]  Hobo kind of killed that guy.
[22:23.720 --> 22:25.100]  Hobo's got a body count.
[22:25.340 --> 22:26.880]  Oh my god, this is amazing.
[22:27.260 --> 22:29.680]  Why would you push someone who's about to fall down anyway?
[22:30.260 --> 22:32.560]  You really want him to fly.
[22:33.000 --> 22:34.300]  But I don't want it to save you either.
[22:35.220 --> 22:38.260]  Nobody ever dies on Mr. Belvedere, they just get AIDS close.
[22:40.080 --> 22:41.800]  Oh, no, here comes the backup.
[22:43.640 --> 22:46.160]  I guess no one could get AIDS in this because it wasn't around yet.
[22:47.260 --> 22:48.420]  It was around.
[22:49.040 --> 22:49.540]  It was?
[22:49.940 --> 22:51.600]  Yeah, it just hadn't made its way to TV yet.
[22:51.720 --> 22:52.140]  Oh, okay.
[22:54.380 --> 22:55.940]  He's like, what's happening? Where's my friend?
[22:57.060 --> 22:57.720]  Get him, Hobo!
[22:58.560 --> 22:59.180]  Get him!
[22:59.860 --> 23:00.720]  Oh my god!
[23:00.940 --> 23:01.300]  Drop him!
[23:01.580 --> 23:02.180]  Oh, he's going to drop him!
[23:02.380 --> 23:02.680]  Yes!
[23:03.740 --> 23:05.200]  Oh my god!
[23:05.520 --> 23:06.540]  Jesus Christ!
[23:07.080 --> 23:08.340]  Hobo's taken out two of them!
[23:08.920 --> 23:10.120]  That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.
[23:10.200 --> 23:11.040]  I am loving this.
[23:14.880 --> 23:20.680]  My favorite part of this is they establish the kid can't see because they know how traumatizing this would be for a child.
[23:20.820 --> 23:24.240]  Like, they need an out for how he can advance past this.
[23:24.300 --> 23:27.660]  The dog was waiting for him to be blinded before he started murdering all these humans.
[23:29.080 --> 23:29.880]  Oh, shit!
[23:30.100 --> 23:30.480]  Jesus!
[23:30.620 --> 23:31.240]  Guns out!
[23:36.520 --> 23:37.420]  Oh, damn!
[23:41.200 --> 23:42.740]  I think Hobo killed him.
[23:43.860 --> 23:44.340]  Yeah.
[23:44.360 --> 23:45.120]  I think he's dead.
[23:45.700 --> 23:49.380]  I mean, that pry bar fell two stories.
[23:49.580 --> 23:49.820]  Yeah.
[23:50.480 --> 23:51.760]  I believe it did.
[23:52.340 --> 23:53.780]  Hit him in the back of the head.
[23:53.900 --> 23:56.600]  Back of the head's a bad place to get hit by a fucking pry bar.
[24:00.140 --> 24:02.120]  Give it to the blind kid.
[24:02.760 --> 24:04.280]  What if he just walks down the stairs?
[24:04.280 --> 24:04.720]  You do one now!
[24:05.140 --> 24:06.840]  You do one now!
[24:07.300 --> 24:09.500]  He just walks down the stairs and hits his mom.
[24:11.820 --> 24:13.320]  Swing for the fences, Jimmy!
[24:14.920 --> 24:16.260]  You've gotta get dirty, too.
[24:16.300 --> 24:17.240]  Half his courage.
[24:17.380 --> 24:18.640]  Now this is courage, kid.
[24:27.230 --> 24:28.490]  In the back!
[24:32.590 --> 24:34.890]  Do you think there was a nail sticking through that board?
[24:35.750 --> 24:36.570]  Has to be.
[24:36.710 --> 24:38.450]  That explained why he went down so fast.
[24:41.010 --> 24:42.190]  I killed two men.
[24:43.470 --> 24:44.750]  This is a Tuesday.
[24:44.930 --> 24:46.350]  Can I have some pets now?
[24:48.150 --> 24:49.770]  Was daddy a murderer?
[24:51.390 --> 24:52.290]  Hard cut!
[24:52.630 --> 24:55.510]  That dog's fucking face at the end is so cool.
[24:56.730 --> 24:59.010]  What if the end credits were just that dog eating the bodies?
[25:03.770 --> 25:05.670]  The littlest, hungriest hobo.
[25:07.790 --> 25:09.830]  Oh, they're all hanging out. They're friends now.
[25:09.890 --> 25:10.850]  And they're taking photos.
[25:11.090 --> 25:11.570]  She proves.
[25:11.570 --> 25:13.750]  The dog's taking a picture!
[25:21.110 --> 25:23.410]  Great-looking photo, too. Look at that!
[25:23.550 --> 25:25.290]  That hobo's smiling now.
[25:26.670 --> 25:27.550]  All taking turns.
[25:28.150 --> 25:31.390]  I wonder if there have ever been any real professional dog photographers.
[25:33.870 --> 25:35.130]  Oh, no, he's leaving!
[25:35.390 --> 25:36.310]  He just keeps going.
[25:36.990 --> 25:38.210]  Bye, hobo!
[25:39.170 --> 25:39.690]  Wow.
[25:41.570 --> 25:43.750]  It's over. He's on to the next town.
[25:45.490 --> 25:47.930]  Oh, my God, Andrew, what the fuck?
[25:48.210 --> 25:48.730]  That's weird.
[25:49.070 --> 25:50.610]  People to kill in the next town over.
[25:51.550 --> 25:52.710]  That bird's big.
[25:53.290 --> 25:53.710]  Andrew.
[25:53.710 --> 25:54.490]  Making new friends.
[25:55.010 --> 25:55.970]  Oh, my God.
[25:56.250 --> 25:56.530]  He's traveling.
[25:56.950 --> 25:57.510]  He's on freight trains.
[25:57.870 --> 25:58.490]  He's the littlest hobo.
[26:01.770 --> 26:03.070]  This was so...
[26:03.070 --> 26:04.510]  This dog was so cool.
[26:04.550 --> 26:04.850]  This is so good.
[26:04.990 --> 26:05.930]  He's a great dog.
[26:07.510 --> 26:08.690]  He can do anything.
[26:08.870 --> 26:10.050]  Littlest hobo can do anything.
[26:10.230 --> 26:11.250]  He can kill people.
[26:11.250 --> 26:12.250]  He can do anything.
[26:12.470 --> 26:15.350]  Do you think there's ever an episode where he surfs?
[26:16.170 --> 26:17.250]  I don't know.
[26:17.470 --> 26:19.450]  I don't think there is from what I've seen, but there should be.
[26:19.790 --> 26:21.150]  There is by the water a lot.
[26:21.450 --> 26:25.130]  If we could get a prop from that, I want the dummy of the guy that fell down the lift.
[26:27.890 --> 26:29.530]  I want the bloody 2x4.
[26:30.310 --> 26:31.830]  Well, that was my blindside.
[26:31.970 --> 26:33.710]  Gavin, you're the only one left now with one.
[26:33.830 --> 26:36.110]  I hope you guys enjoyed this Canadian journey.
[26:36.590 --> 26:36.990]  Phenomenal.
[26:37.130 --> 26:37.530]  Classic television.
[26:38.130 --> 26:39.430]  That was...
[26:39.430 --> 26:39.870]  A plus.
[26:39.870 --> 26:40.690]  Wow.
[26:41.190 --> 26:42.090]  It's a show.
[26:42.410 --> 26:43.750]  How old were you when you saw that?
[26:45.670 --> 26:46.550]  Pretty recently.
[26:46.830 --> 26:47.990]  For the first time?
[26:48.350 --> 26:48.690]  Oh, wow.
[26:48.750 --> 26:48.950]  Yeah.
[26:49.450 --> 26:50.990]  Had you never seen the show as a kid?
[26:51.470 --> 26:55.330]  No, I never grew up watching it, but it was something that I'd heard of and looked into.
[26:56.030 --> 26:57.890]  Is it a beloved classic?
[26:58.430 --> 26:59.850]  Does it still play in reruns?
[27:00.170 --> 27:04.250]  No, I don't think it's rerunning anywhere, but I'm not sure.
[27:04.590 --> 27:05.990]  I haven't just watched cable in a while.
[27:05.990 --> 27:08.310]  That looks like the kind of show...
[27:08.310 --> 27:09.430]  I was born in 86.
[27:09.870 --> 27:15.550]  That looks like the kind of show that they would have shown in the middle of the day on Nickelodeon in 1991.
[27:16.810 --> 27:23.370]  It looks like a show that I would have seen it, because the quality is like...
[27:23.370 --> 27:27.930]  Just a guy with a camera, zooming in long, and that's it.
[27:28.030 --> 27:28.790]  It was...
[27:28.790 --> 27:29.490]  Man, wow.
[27:29.490 --> 27:34.810]  I love that video look of whenever there's a torch or a flashlight on screen, it leaves a trail across the image.
[27:34.910 --> 27:36.690]  That's the shit I grew up watching.
[27:36.690 --> 27:38.850]  Yep, really burning the film.
[27:41.590 --> 27:41.990]  Well...
[27:41.990 --> 27:42.830]  Great blindside.
[27:43.310 --> 27:46.290]  Yeah, congratulations, Andrew. You fucking got us, that's for sure.
[27:46.530 --> 27:49.470]  I do want to do the Tony Hawk thing, like that is a real thing.
[27:51.390 --> 27:52.790]  I'll believe it when I see it.
[27:52.990 --> 27:54.370]  Yeah, we're not falling for that again.
[27:54.610 --> 27:55.070]  No kidding.
[27:55.850 --> 27:56.630]  That's code now.
[27:57.510 --> 27:59.310]  Gavin, do you have any ideas for your blindside?
[28:00.270 --> 28:04.750]  Not currently, but that's definitely put the pressure on, now that I'm the last.
[28:04.750 --> 28:05.590]  We're running out of time.
[28:05.590 --> 28:10.550]  It resets in the new year, so you gotta try to figure out something before January.
[28:10.570 --> 28:11.510]  Did we establish that rule?
[28:12.130 --> 28:12.710]  Yeah, we did.
[28:13.070 --> 28:14.530]  So Geoff's out of bullets, now I'm out.
[28:15.170 --> 28:15.450]  Okay.
[28:15.770 --> 28:17.530]  There's a lot of stuff resetting in the new year.
[28:17.590 --> 28:18.910]  We got Nick's mask coming back.
[28:19.550 --> 28:20.790]  That's true, that's true.
[28:21.610 --> 28:23.690]  New year, all new bits.
[28:24.510 --> 28:24.990]  New bits.
[28:25.970 --> 28:29.570]  I will not be bringing Littlest Hobo back for my second bullet, sadly.
[28:29.990 --> 28:31.630]  Although there's much more to watch.
[28:32.230 --> 28:34.170]  But who's to say Gavin or I won't?
[28:35.190 --> 28:36.270]  That would be a move.
[28:36.730 --> 28:37.750]  That would be crazy.
[28:37.910 --> 28:41.850]  What if somebody blindsided with the same episode?
[28:43.190 --> 28:44.630]  Like that, we gotta watch it again.
[28:45.050 --> 28:45.490]  Miserable.
[28:48.750 --> 28:49.990]  Alright, well there you go.
[28:50.130 --> 28:52.330]  That was a blindside episode two.
[28:52.450 --> 28:54.870]  I hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.
[28:55.010 --> 29:01.910]  And if you're out there somewhere, Littlest Hobo, maybe your paths will cross ours someday.
[29:01.910 --> 29:05.450]  We'd love you to swing by the office and solve a little mystery for us.
[29:05.750 --> 29:07.190]  Then somebody else can say something.
[29:07.350 --> 29:10.090]  I mean, that's probably fine. We can just cut there if you want to.
[29:10.190 --> 29:11.310]  I thought that was a nice ending.
[29:11.530 --> 29:15.210]  Just grab your hat, come travel light, that's hobo style.
[29:17.770 --> 29:19.210]  That's a better ending, I suppose.
