[00:09.930 --> 00:15.050]  Hello, and welcome to what these idiots think is another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:15.290 --> 00:17.990]  It should be 158, but it's not episode 158.
[00:18.250 --> 00:21.810]  It's a brand new show that we're doing at F*** Face called Blindside.
[00:21.990 --> 00:25.390]  Gavin and Andrew, guess what? You just got blindsided.
[00:25.750 --> 00:26.010]  Eric?
[00:27.970 --> 00:29.310]  Is this a fever dream?
[00:30.010 --> 00:31.230]  What? Is this related to Jungle?
[00:32.170 --> 00:36.290]  Congratulations, you thought we were going to be doing another episode of the F*** Face Podcast, but we're not.
[00:36.470 --> 00:38.110]  We're going to be playing Blindside.
[00:38.110 --> 00:41.510]  It's a new show where I have you watch something and you don't have a f***ing choice.
[00:41.610 --> 00:42.410]  You have to watch it with me.
[00:42.630 --> 00:52.170]  Today, we're going to be watching the 1986 episode, season 2, episode 16 from January 31st, 1986 of Mr. Belvedere.
[00:52.350 --> 00:56.050]  It is called Wesley's Friend. That's all I'm going to tell you.
[00:56.150 --> 00:56.530]  Wait a second.
[00:57.010 --> 00:58.290]  We can go ahead and get started.
[00:58.450 --> 01:00.510]  Oh no, I have a few questions before, please.
[01:01.050 --> 01:03.350]  Was this what we were supposed to do last week?
[01:03.690 --> 01:05.990]  Yes, it is. This has been moved three times.
[01:06.950 --> 01:07.910]  That's why.
[01:08.090 --> 01:13.490]  You guys have been blindsiding me over and over and over to get it and you have no idea.
[01:13.730 --> 01:16.270]  Just been mad about this for weeks.
[01:16.690 --> 01:21.830]  That's why you've refused to put less than two calendar invites in every week since this started.
[01:22.610 --> 01:25.350]  I have been so mad.
[01:25.670 --> 01:31.130]  I was so mad when Andrew was... we were right there about to do it and Andrew said, I don't feel like doing two today.
[01:31.490 --> 01:32.810]  It was fine, you were sick, I understood.
[01:32.810 --> 01:37.050]  And then Eric changed the fucking schedule from yesterday to today because he had family and I'm out of town.
[01:37.530 --> 01:44.870]  A show where I blindside you idiots with something and instead you blindsided me over and over to the point where I almost didn't want to fucking do it anymore.
[01:45.150 --> 01:46.490]  But I say it's today or nothing.
[01:46.770 --> 01:49.610]  We're going to watch Mr. Belvedere together.
[01:49.910 --> 01:53.170]  All I'm telling you about this episode is that it's called Wesley's Friend.
[01:53.490 --> 01:56.230]  Have you ever seen Mr. Belvedere? Andrew?
[01:56.850 --> 01:59.250]  No, but the name sounds very familiar for some reason.
[01:59.250 --> 01:59.550]  Gavin?
[01:59.550 --> 02:03.630]  Uh, no, I feel like I've heard the name, never seen a single frame of it.
[02:03.870 --> 02:04.350]  Nick?
[02:04.570 --> 02:05.730]  Not even a little bit, no.
[02:06.430 --> 02:06.710]  Eric?
[02:07.330 --> 02:07.670]  Yes.
[02:08.250 --> 02:16.350]  Okay, it ran for six seasons, it was on ABC, it ran from like 1984 to 1990, so like those six seasons.
[02:17.010 --> 02:18.490]  And this will be season two.
[02:18.910 --> 02:27.050]  The premise of Mr. Belvedere is this guy, Mr. Belvedere, is a British gentleman who comes over to America.
[02:27.050 --> 02:29.130]  He used to work for, I think, Winston Churchill.
[02:29.310 --> 02:34.270]  He comes over to America and he becomes like a butler, like house helper, for this American family.
[02:34.790 --> 02:38.390]  The dad is Bob Uecker, he's like a sports commentator.
[02:38.690 --> 02:44.570]  The mom is cool, and then there's an older son who's in high school, a daughter who's in middle school,
[02:44.690 --> 02:48.470]  and a son, the youngest son, whose name is Wesley, he's like nine or ten.
[02:48.730 --> 02:52.610]  And he's like a Dennis the Menace, like Bart Simpson type character.
[02:52.910 --> 02:53.970]  Pretty Bart Simpson, obviously.
[02:54.670 --> 03:01.650]  Just like a little Rapscallion kid who's always scheming, he's a schemer, he's always up to no good.
[03:01.990 --> 03:06.430]  He's always breaking the rules, and I was desperate to be him when I was a kid.
[03:06.510 --> 03:07.550]  He was like my hero.
[03:08.630 --> 03:11.150]  And here we go. I'm ready to start whenever you guys are.
[03:11.570 --> 03:15.190]  You're gonna have to let me know how the volume is because I haven't tested this in particular.
[03:15.390 --> 03:17.450]  What are the rules when it comes to cooling a blindside?
[03:17.670 --> 03:19.430]  Can we now all blindside each other?
[03:19.490 --> 03:20.910]  You're all able to blindside.
[03:21.090 --> 03:23.130]  Oh, okay. We all got one in the streamer.
[03:23.130 --> 03:29.790]  Yeah. I mean, you can work with me and Nick if you need to, but if you need to do your own blindside without us, then you're welcome to do that as well.
[03:30.290 --> 03:32.450]  That's great. Okay. I'm excited about this.
[03:32.990 --> 03:33.550]  Wesley's friend.
[03:33.670 --> 03:35.330]  How does it feel to be blindsided?
[03:37.390 --> 03:40.290]  Uh, I'm glad that it happened this week and not last week.
[03:40.370 --> 03:43.630]  I don't think I would have processed what being blindsided meant at all.
[03:43.810 --> 03:45.170]  I would have thought I just missed something.
[03:45.590 --> 03:47.870]  It was clear you weren't up to it, so we pushed it.
[03:48.230 --> 03:50.730]  I'm excited about this. I feel like there's a possibility.
[03:50.730 --> 03:52.730]  I've seen Mr. Belvedere. We'll find out.
[03:52.810 --> 03:54.050]  It's just a black screen currently.
[03:54.690 --> 04:00.330]  I'm very curious as to why we are watching episode 16 of season 2 specifically.
[04:00.930 --> 04:04.690]  Well, you'll find out soon. I just think it's a pretty good one. Interesting subject matter.
[04:05.050 --> 04:06.710]  Gavin, I want you to pay special attention.
[04:07.090 --> 04:11.030]  Mr. Belvedere is British. He's a famous British person you may or may not have ever heard of.
[04:11.530 --> 04:17.090]  And this show has a phenomenal intro song.
[04:17.210 --> 04:19.990]  So when it comes up, pay special attention. It's a really good song.
[04:19.990 --> 04:21.150]  I have one question.
[04:21.510 --> 04:24.310]  Did they ever put this episode on vinyl?
[04:25.270 --> 04:28.330]  I don't believe they did. I don't think so.
[04:28.630 --> 04:29.470]  I don't think so.
[04:29.610 --> 04:29.990]  Interesting.
[04:30.550 --> 04:33.330]  Please let me know if the volume is okay.
[04:33.550 --> 04:36.350]  And here we go now.
[05:09.980 --> 05:14.180]  It's the 80s, so everything is vaguely homophobic.
[05:14.720 --> 05:14.920]  Yeah.
[05:29.590 --> 05:31.070]  Do you guys know...
[05:31.070 --> 05:31.570]  Oh, there's Wesley.
[05:32.130 --> 05:33.770]  Do you guys know who Bob Uecker is?
[05:34.310 --> 05:34.750]  No.
[05:35.570 --> 05:37.070]  Oh, man.
[05:41.740 --> 05:43.120]  I thought that was Belvedere.
[05:47.020 --> 05:49.540]  The joke is he's a British butler, but he's seven.
[05:50.080 --> 05:50.300]  Yeah.
[05:50.880 --> 05:53.140]  He's really excited about...
[05:53.140 --> 05:54.180]  That's Mr. Belvedere.
[05:54.560 --> 06:07.350]  Do you recognize Mr. Belvedere, Gavin? Is he famous in England?
[06:08.410 --> 06:09.330]  I don't recognize him.
[06:18.530 --> 06:23.510]  Bob Uecker is just as much of a national treasure as Don Zimmer was,
[06:23.650 --> 06:26.070]  and we should get into Uecker at some point.
[06:26.550 --> 06:28.950]  Is he padded up, or does he just look like...
[06:28.950 --> 06:31.290]  Yeah, I was going to say, he seems very stiff.
[06:32.250 --> 06:32.830]  I don't know.
[06:37.260 --> 06:38.940]  He moves like an action figure.
[06:42.380 --> 06:42.820]  What?
[06:44.400 --> 06:45.140]  Wait, what?
[06:51.970 --> 06:53.190]  Wait, somebody has AIDS?
[06:53.190 --> 06:54.490]  This kid just dropped an AIDS bomb.
[06:55.990 --> 06:57.450]  Right into the intro?
[06:58.510 --> 06:59.810]  That's the hook?
[06:59.990 --> 07:02.670]  This is a sitcom, and they just...
[07:05.010 --> 07:06.130]  What's happening?
[07:08.850 --> 07:09.890]  Oh, no.
[07:11.650 --> 07:13.830]  Geoff, why are you making us watch this?
[07:14.390 --> 07:15.450]  It's Mr. Belvedere, man.
[07:15.450 --> 07:16.190]  He's the best.
[07:17.950 --> 07:18.510]  Okay.
[07:19.010 --> 07:23.370]  And I think it's important to see how we dealt with things like AIDS in the 80s.
[07:24.630 --> 07:26.950]  Did Mr. Belvedere deal with AIDS?
[07:27.170 --> 07:28.510]  Is that...
[07:28.510 --> 07:30.570]  Do we need to credit him, medically?
[07:31.670 --> 07:34.950]  I wonder whatever happened to Bryce Beckham.
[07:35.090 --> 07:36.410]  I wonder if he had a career after this.
[07:36.910 --> 07:37.970]  He was so good as Wesley.
[07:38.790 --> 07:40.670]  Bob Uecker's name looks like a typo.
[07:41.230 --> 07:43.590]  Have you ever seen the movie Major League, Gavin?
[07:44.010 --> 07:44.330]  No.
[07:45.150 --> 07:46.570]  That's my favorite movie.
[07:47.030 --> 07:48.110]  Bob Uecker's great in it.
[07:49.030 --> 07:50.730]  Is this a super rich family?
[07:51.130 --> 07:52.270]  I don't think so.
[07:52.730 --> 07:54.190]  No, this is just how things were in the 80s.
[07:54.510 --> 07:54.730]  Yeah.
[07:55.570 --> 07:58.690]  So he hitchhiked there, and now he lives with them for some reason?
[08:04.290 --> 08:06.450]  This is a pretty successful blindside, Geoff.
[08:06.990 --> 08:09.450]  Yeah, I wanted to blindside you in a lot of ways.
[08:09.610 --> 08:11.710]  I don't think anyone's more blindsided than Danny, though.
[08:12.150 --> 08:12.810]  That's a tough...
[08:12.810 --> 08:13.730]  That's a big blindside.
[08:17.850 --> 08:18.650]  It's usually...
[08:18.650 --> 08:20.110]  What's he doing with AIDS?
[08:20.110 --> 08:20.950]  What's he doing?
[08:37.260 --> 08:38.060]  He does?
[08:39.040 --> 08:39.580]  Does he?
[08:40.100 --> 08:41.180]  That's very specific.
[08:41.920 --> 08:43.520]  Also, you can't have chewing gum?
[08:45.920 --> 08:46.340]  Oh, not in school.
[08:46.340 --> 08:48.140]  Yeah, getting caught with chewing gum is bad, apparently.
[08:54.640 --> 08:55.440]  Can you...
[08:56.040 --> 08:57.240]  For the rest of his life,
[08:57.280 --> 08:59.560]  he'll remember this moment in that outfit.
[09:00.100 --> 09:00.300]  Yeah.
[09:10.240 --> 09:11.660]  I can see, Geoff,
[09:11.800 --> 09:12.660]  why this was your hero.
[09:12.920 --> 09:14.300]  Oh, he's my hero, man.
[09:28.760 --> 09:30.160]  It's a lot like shoplifting.
[09:30.640 --> 09:32.040]  That's pretty close!
[09:47.200 --> 09:50.020]  Are we, like, six minutes into this?
[09:50.460 --> 09:51.480]  Yeah, it's a...
[09:52.060 --> 09:53.040]  It's a doozy.
[09:53.380 --> 09:54.300]  It's brutal.
[09:54.840 --> 09:55.520]  It's real rough.
[10:00.440 --> 10:01.640]  After this episode,
[10:01.720 --> 10:03.940]  which I have watched twice to get ready for this,
[10:04.520 --> 10:05.160]  I watched...
[10:05.160 --> 10:06.880]  I just let it run and I watched, like,
[10:06.940 --> 10:07.720]  20 other episodes.
[10:07.940 --> 10:09.580]  They're all way funnier than this one.
[10:10.360 --> 10:11.380]  That's not shocking.
[10:21.950 --> 10:22.390]  Why?
[10:22.750 --> 10:24.350]  I guess is my main reason so far.
[10:24.650 --> 10:27.530]  Is this a thing where, like...
[10:27.530 --> 10:28.330]  Why does he have AIDS?
[10:28.490 --> 10:30.630]  No, like, why did they decide to make this?
[10:31.170 --> 10:33.970]  Was there a wave of, like, sitcom episodes
[10:33.970 --> 10:35.530]  where characters get AIDS
[10:35.530 --> 10:36.930]  as, like, an educational tool?
[10:37.350 --> 10:39.710]  Yeah, this is how we handled
[10:39.710 --> 10:41.050]  complicated subjects
[10:41.050 --> 10:43.770]  in the 80s when there wasn't shit like the internet
[10:43.770 --> 10:46.030]  and you had to explain to people what they were.
[10:46.390 --> 10:47.370]  Yeah, like that really
[10:47.910 --> 10:49.570]  bummer episode of Fresh Prince
[10:49.570 --> 10:51.630]  where it's all about, like, drink driving and stuff.
[10:51.870 --> 10:53.270]  Yeah. Exactly.
[10:53.810 --> 10:55.710]  Or, like, the 21 Jump Street about AIDS.
[10:56.170 --> 10:57.870]  Or the Quincy about AIDS.
[10:59.350 --> 11:01.290]  Like, very special episodes
[11:01.290 --> 11:03.350]  was just what we did with TV.
[11:03.350 --> 11:05.330]  Yeah, it really was a big...
[11:05.330 --> 11:08.030]  It seems silly now, but it really was a...
[11:08.030 --> 11:09.690]  This was a very special episode
[11:09.690 --> 11:11.410]  of Mr. Belvedere, and that was code
[11:11.410 --> 11:13.350]  for we're dealing with something
[11:13.350 --> 11:15.790]  that's very culturally tumultuous
[11:15.790 --> 11:16.650]  and difficult.
[11:17.510 --> 11:19.450]  Maybe Fauci will walk into the house.
[11:20.750 --> 11:21.530]  Dude, he was still...
[11:21.530 --> 11:23.390]  He was fucking working in his job back then.
[11:24.190 --> 11:25.150]  Yeah, he worked on AIDS.
[11:25.910 --> 11:26.110]  Yeah.
[11:28.170 --> 11:28.970]  Against AIDS.
[11:28.970 --> 11:29.050]  Against AIDS.
[11:34.150 --> 11:34.670]  They're
[11:34.670 --> 11:36.690]  just doing other stuff
[11:36.690 --> 11:37.850]  in this episode also.
[11:38.290 --> 11:39.190]  And that's crazy.
[11:39.970 --> 11:42.030]  Has Mr. Belvedere moved his arms yet?
[11:44.990 --> 11:46.590]  British people don't move their arms, Gavin.
[11:46.710 --> 11:47.110]  You know that.
[11:47.730 --> 11:50.050]  They keep them sturdily at their sides.
[11:56.280 --> 11:56.580]  Ew.
[12:03.600 --> 12:04.080]  Uh...
[12:08.140 --> 12:09.280]  It is
[12:09.280 --> 12:10.400]  an interesting thing of like,
[12:10.480 --> 12:11.860]  we're going to cover AIDS, but also
[12:11.860 --> 12:13.040]  let's find room for fun.
[12:13.600 --> 12:15.380]  It's still a sitcom, right?
[12:15.660 --> 12:18.080]  This is why there's a writer's
[12:18.080 --> 12:18.740]  strike, right?
[12:19.640 --> 12:21.360]  To be able to do this
[12:22.200 --> 12:23.880]  and move between your A story
[12:23.880 --> 12:25.800]  and then your insane B and C stories
[12:25.800 --> 12:27.760]  is, I mean, not easy.
[12:28.480 --> 12:29.560]  I was wondering
[12:29.560 --> 12:32.560]  if putting this on would...
[12:32.560 --> 12:33.860]  would completely
[12:35.160 --> 12:36.360]  floor you guys
[12:36.360 --> 12:38.360]  and leave you tongue-tied. And I think it has.
[12:38.520 --> 12:39.740]  I'm kind of happy about that.
[12:40.680 --> 12:42.160]  I'm blindsided to the moon.
[12:42.280 --> 12:43.280]  That's kind of what I was going for.
[12:44.080 --> 12:48.280]  Uh-oh, Kev.
[12:51.350 --> 12:52.390]  Always use his arm.
[12:56.200 --> 12:56.560]  Wait.
[12:57.620 --> 12:58.640]  This is the AIDS kid?
[12:59.160 --> 12:59.360]  Yeah.
[13:00.260 --> 13:01.040]  Oh, God.
[13:08.820 --> 13:09.280]  Jesus!
[13:09.280 --> 13:10.020]  God.
[13:13.100 --> 13:15.420]  It's honestly that moment that I wanted
[13:15.420 --> 13:16.900]  to watch this. Wow!
[13:23.110 --> 13:25.490]  They gave this kid AIDS and a
[13:25.490 --> 13:27.430]  deviated septum. It's so unclear.
[13:32.830 --> 13:34.010]  Oh, this is tragic.
[13:34.830 --> 13:35.590]  It's really sad.
[13:37.270 --> 13:38.950]  Was Danny a regular
[13:38.950 --> 13:40.310]  character to this point?
[13:41.530 --> 13:42.650]  I don't...
[13:42.650 --> 13:44.790]  That's a great question, and I don't know the answer.
[13:44.790 --> 13:46.970]  I bet he wasn't.
[13:55.570 --> 13:56.870]  Wesley doesn't want to touch it.
[13:57.230 --> 13:57.810]  Because, yeah.
[14:06.420 --> 14:07.980]  You didn't do anything wrong, Danny.
[14:09.160 --> 14:10.160]  It's just Wesley's
[14:10.160 --> 14:10.480]  prejudice.
[14:11.680 --> 14:13.460]  And it's just fear. He doesn't understand.
[14:13.960 --> 14:15.460]  But that was such a big thing, right?
[14:15.820 --> 14:18.080]  Was it like Princess Diana?
[14:18.680 --> 14:20.060]  Yeah, it was a big deal when
[14:20.060 --> 14:21.820]  she came and
[14:21.820 --> 14:23.500]  hugged and embraced people with AIDS.
[14:25.280 --> 14:26.160]  It actually
[14:26.880 --> 14:28.120]  did a lot of good in the
[14:28.120 --> 14:29.340]  world at that moment.
[14:29.760 --> 14:32.160]  But again, because at this point, we needed very special
[14:32.160 --> 14:33.940]  episodes on how to handle this stuff.
[14:36.520 --> 14:37.800]  I just think it's like...
[14:37.800 --> 14:40.140]  This was mentioned on Reddit recently, and I went down a rabbit
[14:40.140 --> 14:42.100]  hole of reading about it.
[14:42.280 --> 14:44.180]  And then, remembering how much
[14:44.180 --> 14:46.140]  I love Mr. Belvedere, and watching all the funny episodes
[14:46.140 --> 14:47.780]  of Mr. Belvedere, the show's still great.
[14:48.280 --> 14:50.060]  But I just couldn't get over, like...
[14:50.060 --> 14:52.080]  I had forgotten about how this is how we used
[14:52.080 --> 14:54.000]  to deal with stuff as a society, at least
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.060]  in America. And I thought it was just kind of like a
[14:56.060 --> 14:57.280]  fascinating look back.
[14:58.220 --> 14:59.080]  Not that long ago.
[15:00.860 --> 15:01.440]  Plus,
[15:02.180 --> 15:04.280]  Gavin's right. He has not moved his arms.
[15:04.660 --> 15:05.200]  Like, at all.
[15:05.960 --> 15:07.320]  He's so stiff.
[15:07.880 --> 15:09.660]  It's so low. A door
[15:09.660 --> 15:12.060]  is so low. He's a big man.
[15:12.280 --> 15:12.760]  You know what I mean?
[15:13.400 --> 15:15.440]  Maybe that's butlering 101.
[15:17.040 --> 15:18.240]  Lock up the arms.
[15:36.130 --> 15:37.730]  I would love
[15:38.190 --> 15:39.450]  to talk to someone
[15:41.230 --> 15:41.850]  who... this was
[15:41.850 --> 15:43.850]  their introduction to what AIDS is.
[15:44.150 --> 15:45.450]  I mean, you might
[15:46.350 --> 15:46.770]  be.
[15:48.470 --> 15:49.830]  Part of why I wanted to watch this
[15:49.830 --> 15:51.170]  is because this is one of the first times
[15:51.600 --> 15:53.810]  I remember hearing about AIDS.
[15:54.050 --> 15:55.710]  Oh, wow. Yeah. I was
[15:55.710 --> 15:57.870]  11, maybe, when this came out. 10 or 11.
[15:58.490 --> 15:59.810]  How new was AIDS when this
[15:59.810 --> 16:00.190]  came out?
[16:01.550 --> 16:03.630]  Well, this was 80... probably, what?
[16:03.670 --> 16:05.650]  85? 86, I think.
[16:05.650 --> 16:06.610]  Yeah, January of 86.
[16:07.370 --> 16:09.170]  So, this was like...
[16:09.170 --> 16:11.850]  I think it had been, what? In the news
[16:11.850 --> 16:13.870]  for a few years at this point.
[16:14.130 --> 16:15.190]  Probably about 4 or 5 years.
[16:15.330 --> 16:17.450]  Yeah, and it became a culturally really
[16:17.450 --> 16:20.010]  significant thing at this point.
[16:20.490 --> 16:21.670]  This was definitely
[16:21.670 --> 16:23.950]  right at the ramping
[16:23.950 --> 16:25.650]  up of the height of the
[16:26.470 --> 16:27.510]  irrational hysteria.
[16:27.710 --> 16:28.030]  Yes.
[16:29.290 --> 16:31.210]  So, when you watch this
[16:31.770 --> 16:33.410]  or something like this,
[16:33.410 --> 16:35.210]  were you aware
[16:35.210 --> 16:36.910]  that this was going to be a special
[16:36.910 --> 16:38.930]  one-off, very specific
[16:38.930 --> 16:41.250]  episode, or were you
[16:41.250 --> 16:43.710]  blindsided in the same way Gavin and I were?
[16:43.990 --> 16:45.190]  No, they were promoted
[16:45.190 --> 16:47.070]  as, like, coming up on Thursday
[16:47.070 --> 16:49.230]  on a very special episode of Mr.
[16:49.310 --> 16:51.250]  Belvedere, Wesley's friend deals with
[16:51.250 --> 16:53.070]  a complicated medical
[16:53.070 --> 16:55.130]  mystery, or something like that.
[16:55.450 --> 16:57.230]  It would be that, and then they would
[16:57.230 --> 16:59.390]  cut in moments from the episode
[16:59.390 --> 17:01.370]  of little pull quotes, and it was probably
[17:01.370 --> 17:03.390]  dealing with something very
[17:04.230 --> 17:05.430]  difficult, and then it
[17:05.430 --> 17:07.330]  would be a hard cut of the kid going, I got AIDS,
[17:07.430 --> 17:09.350]  but other than that, I'm okay, and it would be
[17:09.350 --> 17:10.610]  like, oh, what the fuck?
[17:11.490 --> 17:12.170]  That's just...
[17:14.010 --> 17:15.370]  TV? Insane in the 80s.
[17:15.530 --> 17:17.390]  Crazy. I mean, I just watched three
[17:17.390 --> 17:19.450]  adults try and dance around anal in front
[17:19.450 --> 17:19.870]  of a kid.
[17:25.320 --> 17:27.060]  It's like, they would do this, or they would
[17:27.060 --> 17:29.020]  have after-school specials, that was
[17:29.020 --> 17:31.140]  the other way we presented stuff.
[17:31.140 --> 17:32.940]  I learned about bulimia
[17:32.940 --> 17:35.220]  and anorexia from an after-school special.
[17:35.420 --> 17:35.840]  I remember
[17:36.980 --> 17:38.380]  watching it and being like, oh,
[17:38.860 --> 17:40.640]  that's what those things are, I had no idea.
[17:41.320 --> 17:42.680]  These were, I mean...
[17:43.160 --> 17:45.160]  I think these were pretty culturally important
[17:46.140 --> 17:47.180]  sitcoms like this, and the way
[17:47.180 --> 17:48.740]  they handled stuff, because there really was
[17:48.740 --> 17:51.220]  so much paranoia, and so much misinformation.
[17:52.020 --> 17:52.700]  I mean, I was
[17:53.420 --> 17:55.260]  Wesley's age when this came out,
[17:55.280 --> 17:56.180]  you know, essentially.
[17:56.800 --> 17:57.200]  And
[17:58.820 --> 18:00.920]  we didn't really know
[18:00.920 --> 18:02.640]  about... I mean, our parents weren't telling us shit.
[18:03.020 --> 18:04.740]  Nobody watched the news, it was boring
[18:04.740 --> 18:06.680]  for old people, so this is how we found out about stuff.
[18:21.580 --> 18:23.040]  So, from a content
[18:23.040 --> 18:24.440]  perspective, is it
[18:24.440 --> 18:26.880]  that people are going to listen to us
[18:26.880 --> 18:28.900]  watch this episode, and they will sync up?
[18:29.000 --> 18:30.420]  Or what is... I think so.
[18:31.060 --> 18:32.600]  I'll put the link in the description.
[18:33.380 --> 18:34.960]  We're just watching a YouTube video.
[18:35.260 --> 18:36.440]  It's just a YouTube...
[18:36.440 --> 18:37.940]  Yeah. I just didn't know.
[18:39.100 --> 18:40.080]  I didn't know if we were
[18:40.080 --> 18:42.060]  including Mr. Belvedere on our channel.
[18:42.660 --> 18:44.200]  I don't know that we'll even
[18:44.200 --> 18:46.760]  release this, this is just a test. I just wanted to see how it went.
[18:47.100 --> 18:48.460]  Back to our quirky
[18:48.460 --> 18:50.300]  B-story. Yeah, the B-story,
[18:50.340 --> 18:51.560]  like, oh my god.
[18:52.180 --> 18:53.360]  The B-story is,
[18:54.020 --> 18:56.040]  Kevin's doing girl stuff, but it's okay,
[18:56.180 --> 18:56.960]  he's not gay.
[18:58.060 --> 18:59.560]  That's definitely what this is.
[18:59.880 --> 19:01.420]  It's 100% what this is.
[19:02.020 --> 19:03.060]  It's just so...
[19:03.060 --> 19:05.060]  It's no wonder so many people,
[19:05.240 --> 19:07.180]  like, it's no wonder my generation's all fucked up.
[19:07.560 --> 19:07.700]  Yeah.
[19:09.640 --> 19:10.440]  God damn.
[19:15.010 --> 19:16.170]  Oh, he's moving his arms.
[19:17.830 --> 19:18.690]  He can
[19:18.690 --> 19:20.010]  when he absolutely must.
[19:20.330 --> 19:22.550]  But only when he absolutely must.
[19:22.770 --> 19:23.390]  Oh, he stopped again.
[19:31.240 --> 19:31.920]  What is the matter?
[19:46.520 --> 19:46.840]  Ugh.
[19:49.510 --> 19:50.030]  Ugh.
[19:51.270 --> 19:52.670]  That's fucking heartbreaking.
[19:52.710 --> 19:54.330]  That's really rough.
[19:54.850 --> 19:55.370]  Ugh.
[20:02.140 --> 20:03.600]  It's weird to think that,
[20:03.900 --> 20:05.820]  like, at least this generation,
[20:06.000 --> 20:07.300]  but probably others,
[20:07.600 --> 20:09.320]  but at least my generation,
[20:09.440 --> 20:10.700]  we learned our morality
[20:11.840 --> 20:13.820]  from fake families on TV.
[20:14.440 --> 20:14.580]  Yeah.
[20:15.040 --> 20:17.160]  It's a useful place to learn about shit, I guess.
[20:17.260 --> 20:18.240]  Yeah, I guess.
[20:19.800 --> 20:20.880]  I guess it is.
[20:21.380 --> 20:22.600]  Kevin made that.
[20:22.900 --> 20:23.540]  Kevin made it.
[20:25.560 --> 20:26.880]  He looks like the fourth doctor.
[20:26.880 --> 20:26.980]  Yeah.
[20:34.000 --> 20:34.920]  A soupy
[20:34.920 --> 20:36.420]  sales reference. Awesome.
[20:39.020 --> 20:40.980]  I thought about, because I watched so many
[20:40.980 --> 20:42.760]  episodes of Mr. Belvedere, I thought about making you guys
[20:42.760 --> 20:44.380]  just watch a really funny, good one,
[20:44.760 --> 20:47.100]  but that didn't seem like as much of a blindside
[20:48.340 --> 20:48.800]  as...
[20:48.800 --> 20:50.460]  You started, uh...
[20:50.460 --> 20:51.760]  You started hot.
[20:52.380 --> 20:54.240]  Great ideas for other blindsides.
[20:54.240 --> 20:56.400]  Good, good. I want you guys to blindside the shit
[20:56.400 --> 20:58.020]  out of each other and me as well.
[20:58.400 --> 21:00.420]  What the fuck is going
[21:00.420 --> 21:00.940]  on?
[21:10.510 --> 21:11.930]  Can you imagine Lincoln
[21:11.930 --> 21:13.250]  on spring break in Tijuana?
[21:13.690 --> 21:15.710]  I'm just imagining if that was the hat he wore
[21:15.710 --> 21:16.410]  when he got killed.
[21:17.850 --> 21:19.390]  Oh, yeah.
[21:19.470 --> 21:21.650]  He's one of the ones that got bipped, isn't he?
[21:21.710 --> 21:22.970]  Lincoln at the donkey show?
[21:23.750 --> 21:24.770]  Oh, God.
[21:28.530 --> 21:30.010]  They gave that poor little kid
[21:30.010 --> 21:31.890]  the worst glasses and haircut
[21:31.890 --> 21:34.010]  on earth. Oh, I think that's just probably
[21:34.010 --> 21:34.830]  what he looked like.
[21:36.230 --> 21:38.070]  Looks like a little Rick Moranis.
[21:38.710 --> 21:39.270]  Yeah, he does.
[21:45.210 --> 21:46.250]  Come on, Wesley.
[21:54.880 --> 21:55.580]  I gotta
[21:55.580 --> 21:57.360]  look out for number one over here.
[21:58.800 --> 21:59.360]  Jesus,
[21:59.580 --> 22:00.900]  this is...
[22:01.560 --> 22:03.340]  The concept of him
[22:03.340 --> 22:05.440]  growing up and then reflecting on
[22:05.440 --> 22:06.460]  these things. Oh, yeah.
[22:22.190 --> 22:22.750]  Yeah!
[22:22.750 --> 22:22.870]  Yeah!
[22:25.590 --> 22:26.330]  That's awesome.
[22:26.330 --> 22:29.010]  Oh, my God. Dude, that's a movie.
[22:29.270 --> 22:30.950]  Don't blindside us with Porky's, please.
[22:31.150 --> 22:32.250]  We can't do that. No, we can't.
[22:32.510 --> 22:34.050]  That was Porky's.
[22:34.410 --> 22:36.330]  Oh, dude, it's... Oh, no.
[22:37.070 --> 22:38.190]  It is a movie that
[22:38.730 --> 22:40.630]  wasn't aging well when it was coming out.
[22:43.130 --> 22:45.030]  I saw it when I was
[22:45.030 --> 22:46.510]  seven, maybe.
[22:48.450 --> 22:48.970]  About
[22:48.970 --> 22:50.290]  15 years too young.
[22:51.350 --> 22:52.790]  I would love to...
[22:53.410 --> 22:54.270]  I can't
[22:54.270 --> 22:55.790]  imagine this happening in England
[22:55.790 --> 22:57.410]  where everyone gets up and
[22:58.090 --> 23:00.110]  dresses up as old prime ministers.
[23:00.730 --> 23:02.170]  They don't do this in England?
[23:02.510 --> 23:04.290]  We don't really glorify our politicians
[23:04.290 --> 23:05.450]  like this. Dude,
[23:06.250 --> 23:08.250]  I would say that every American,
[23:08.690 --> 23:10.210]  including the other two Americans
[23:10.210 --> 23:12.170]  on this podcast, have had to wear
[23:12.170 --> 23:14.130]  a Pilgrim uniform or
[23:14.130 --> 23:16.110]  a President Lincoln uniform at least twice
[23:16.110 --> 23:16.850]  in their childhood.
[23:22.670 --> 23:23.310]  Please be
[23:23.310 --> 23:24.250]  John Wilkes Booth.
[23:40.580 --> 23:42.080]  He fucking lost the
[23:42.080 --> 23:42.440]  plot.
[23:45.390 --> 23:47.070]  When did school go out of fashion?
[23:48.590 --> 23:48.990]  That's a great
[23:48.990 --> 23:50.770]  question. Yeah, it is.
[23:56.810 --> 23:57.290]  Yeah.
[24:04.320 --> 24:05.220]  See, he learned.
[24:05.460 --> 24:06.220]  And now he's teaching us.
[24:07.240 --> 24:08.520]  I'd like to think so.
[24:10.720 --> 24:12.080]  I've seen this episode a bunch.
[24:20.380 --> 24:21.860]  This is great, because
[24:22.380 --> 24:24.040]  Danny is in every way a kid.
[24:28.140 --> 24:29.600]  You see the boom mic?
[24:29.660 --> 24:30.060]  Oh, the boom!
[24:48.890 --> 24:51.190]  What Danny is wearing there is a
[24:51.190 --> 24:53.130]  members only jacket. That is what every
[24:53.130 --> 24:54.910]  kid in America wore in 1986.
[24:59.920 --> 25:01.040]  Look at that big ass peanut.
[25:13.160 --> 25:14.500]  Wesley looks like a croupier.
[25:17.540 --> 25:18.820]  Or a flamingo dancer.
[25:22.680 --> 25:25.360]  They both look like tiny adults.
[25:25.780 --> 25:27.340]  They don't have the
[25:27.340 --> 25:28.940]  proportions of children or something.
[25:29.300 --> 25:30.880]  They look strange.
[25:31.560 --> 25:33.400]  Maybe it's the way the clothes fit.
[25:35.380 --> 25:37.300]  Well, they say the camera adds 10 years.
[25:44.520 --> 25:45.760]  I'm so glad we don't
[25:45.760 --> 25:46.840]  have haircuts like that anymore.
[25:47.320 --> 25:47.760]  Right.
[25:48.340 --> 25:49.460]  Shall we all do it?
[25:52.180 --> 25:53.600]  For summer of 98?
[25:55.640 --> 25:56.820]  Maybe if we do a summer of
[25:56.820 --> 25:58.680]  89 someday, we'll get bald haircuts.
[26:04.790 --> 26:07.490]  Yeah, they're going to Gettysburg.
[26:07.650 --> 26:10.170]  Of course, Wesley would be the south.
[26:11.590 --> 26:12.750]  So Danny wasn't a regular
[26:12.750 --> 26:14.570]  before, but now clearly this episode
[26:14.570 --> 26:16.590]  about acceptance and having him around.
[26:16.690 --> 26:18.270]  He'll be in later episodes, right?
[26:18.270 --> 26:20.190]  We'll see Danny again.
[26:20.450 --> 26:21.010]  Won't we?
[26:23.330 --> 26:24.610]  That's a great question, Andrew.
[26:25.090 --> 26:25.830]  We'll have to
[26:26.430 --> 26:28.630]  tune into another episode of Blindside to find out.
[26:31.430 --> 26:32.270]  It's okay, Danny.
[26:39.850 --> 26:41.790]  This is how I learned about British people.
[26:44.910 --> 26:45.870]  Oh, here it is.
[26:48.510 --> 26:49.970]  If Mr. Belvedere was
[26:49.970 --> 26:51.750]  a toad in the hole, Gavin, how long would he last?
[26:52.430 --> 26:53.650]  Oh, I think he'd last
[26:54.230 --> 26:55.190]  multiple episodes.
[26:55.350 --> 26:55.710]  Really?
[26:58.210 --> 26:59.790]  Is this how every episode
[26:59.790 --> 27:01.950]  ended? I wonder if the people
[27:01.950 --> 27:03.930]  in England knew about Mr. Belvedere
[27:03.930 --> 27:05.430]  when it was running in America.
[27:06.290 --> 27:06.990]  Good question.
[27:07.550 --> 27:09.950]  Is this like Jerry's final thought?
[27:10.830 --> 27:11.010]  Yeah.
[27:11.430 --> 27:13.010]  It was him sort of wrapping it up.
[27:13.630 --> 27:15.750]  He writes in his diary at the end of every episode.
[27:16.230 --> 27:17.230]  Did he eventually get a laptop?
[27:18.650 --> 27:19.130]  No.
[27:19.810 --> 27:21.070]  Mr. Belvedere's not a laptop
[27:21.070 --> 27:21.570]  kind of guy.
[27:22.590 --> 27:23.510]  Too much movement.
[27:29.430 --> 27:30.410]  What the hell?
[27:31.070 --> 27:33.450]  I hope you all learned
[27:33.450 --> 27:35.230]  something from this episode.
[27:35.390 --> 27:37.690]  Do you think that Noam Pitlick was really excited
[27:37.690 --> 27:38.810]  to direct that?
[27:39.910 --> 27:41.690]  He's like, I booked
[27:41.690 --> 27:43.270]  a Mr. Belvedere because this is big, right?
[27:43.710 --> 27:45.150]  Yeah, it was a big show.
[27:45.610 --> 27:46.110]  Oh, man.
[27:46.550 --> 27:48.890]  There you go. That was Mr. Belvedere.
[27:48.990 --> 27:50.790]  A very special episode of Mr. Belvedere.
[27:50.790 --> 27:52.970]  Usually a lot more irreverent.
[27:53.850 --> 27:54.750]  This one was a little
[27:54.750 --> 27:56.810]  serious, but I think it's important
[27:56.810 --> 27:58.890]  because I wanted to teach you guys
[27:58.890 --> 28:00.990]  a little bit about compassion and understanding.
[28:02.010 --> 28:02.910]  You wanted to teach
[28:02.910 --> 28:05.170]  us about compassion and understanding?
[28:05.390 --> 28:06.970]  Yeah, I feel like you could use a little
[28:06.970 --> 28:08.510]  helping of compassion and understanding.
[28:09.190 --> 28:09.790]  Wow, thanks, man.
[28:10.370 --> 28:10.910]  No problem.
[28:11.210 --> 28:12.250]  I don't remember that.
[28:16.250 --> 28:16.710]  So,
[28:17.890 --> 28:18.810]  that was
[28:19.730 --> 28:21.270]  F*** Face Blindside.
[28:28.050 --> 28:28.690]  Let's
[28:28.690 --> 28:30.930]  break this down. Let's debrief a little bit.
[28:31.690 --> 28:32.830]  Initial thoughts?
[28:33.390 --> 28:34.610]  I'm incredibly blindsided.
[28:34.990 --> 28:36.910]  I think the audience should
[28:36.910 --> 28:38.950]  be equally blindsided. I don't think there should be any
[28:38.950 --> 28:40.410]  reference to this existing,
[28:40.770 --> 28:43.130]  and I think it should just come out as is.
[28:43.710 --> 28:45.350]  What do we call it?
[28:45.670 --> 28:46.670]  You have to call it
[28:46.670 --> 28:48.510]  F*** Face Episode 157,
[28:48.610 --> 28:50.030]  so the audience is also blindsided.
[28:50.470 --> 28:52.550]  So we are calling it... it comes out
[28:52.550 --> 28:53.510]  in place of an episode?
[28:54.010 --> 28:56.670]  And then after this, episode 157
[28:57.190 --> 28:58.350]  actual should come out.
[28:58.770 --> 29:00.150]  Well, this is 158, but yeah.
[29:00.490 --> 29:01.330]  Oh, that's right.
[29:01.770 --> 29:04.890]  Could there be episode 157 with an asterisk
[29:04.890 --> 29:06.010]  next to it, maybe?
[29:06.510 --> 29:08.710]  158? Like a little indication?
[29:09.430 --> 29:10.350]  So you're saying
[29:10.350 --> 29:12.350]  put out 158
[29:12.350 --> 29:13.050]  158?
[29:14.870 --> 29:16.310]  Put this out first.
[29:16.810 --> 29:18.330]  This is gonna release on a Friday, right?
[29:18.490 --> 29:20.290]  So it won't release on a normal day.
[29:20.750 --> 29:22.410]  Put this out as 158.
[29:22.890 --> 29:24.310]  It'll be blindsided for a day.
[29:24.830 --> 29:26.350]  Or it'll be that for a day, and then change
[29:26.350 --> 29:28.530]  the name to Blindside Episode 1.
[29:28.590 --> 29:30.390]  I think we might be
[29:30.390 --> 29:32.450]  f***ing ourselves over if we...
[29:33.410 --> 29:34.270]  What if we just
[29:34.270 --> 29:35.810]  put it out with no title?
[29:37.150 --> 29:37.890]  What do you mean?
[29:38.450 --> 29:40.210]  No, I have to write something.
[29:40.210 --> 29:42.130]  I have to write... there has to be
[29:42.130 --> 29:44.110]  a description and a title.
[29:44.530 --> 29:45.930]  There has to be something.
[29:46.370 --> 29:47.750]  What if the title is just
[29:47.750 --> 29:48.450]  Watch?
[29:49.470 --> 29:49.910]  What?
[29:50.130 --> 29:54.470]  What if the title is just titles?
[29:55.810 --> 29:56.370]  These are the kind of
[29:56.370 --> 29:58.210]  ideas that Geoff would bust into my
[29:58.210 --> 30:00.490]  bedroom with back in the day, and I loved it.
[30:00.770 --> 30:01.670]  They're always great.
[30:02.150 --> 30:04.290]  So, what if... I'm gonna propose this.
[30:04.370 --> 30:06.330]  When we put this out, I'm not sure the date.
[30:06.410 --> 30:08.130]  We'll have to look at when we can get this
[30:08.130 --> 30:09.290]  edited and turned around and everything.
[30:10.390 --> 30:11.930]  But, what if this comes out,
[30:11.990 --> 30:13.770]  we're not putting it out, like when an episode comes out,
[30:13.810 --> 30:15.970]  we'll do it on the Friday-Saturday cadence
[30:15.970 --> 30:18.130]  like we usually do, and we'll put it out
[30:18.130 --> 30:19.790]  and the title will just be Watch,
[30:19.930 --> 30:21.890]  and the description will just be a YouTube link
[30:21.890 --> 30:23.690]  to the Mr. Belvedere episode,
[30:24.330 --> 30:25.150]  and that's it.
[30:25.810 --> 30:28.050]  That's great. And we need to make it clear to the audience
[30:28.770 --> 30:29.890]  that up until
[30:30.450 --> 30:32.090]  half an hour ago, we thought we were about
[30:32.090 --> 30:34.070]  to record Episode 158.
[30:36.470 --> 30:38.170]  Is that what we're doing then?
[30:38.750 --> 30:39.610]  I don't know.
[30:39.710 --> 30:42.950]  Maybe instead of Watch, maybe it's like...
[30:43.470 --> 30:43.910]  Listen?
[30:44.170 --> 30:45.130]  What about Question Mark?
[30:45.830 --> 30:48.090]  Yeah, can you just put a question mark?
[30:48.550 --> 30:49.730]  I can try.
[30:50.410 --> 30:51.250]  Maybe just why?
[30:51.730 --> 30:54.790]  If you can't just put a question mark,
[30:54.850 --> 30:56.170]  can you write the word question mark?
[30:56.170 --> 30:57.470]  Question mark? Yeah, okay.
[30:58.590 --> 30:58.810]  Okay.
[30:59.750 --> 31:01.310]  That could be blindside in a different language.
[31:03.330 --> 31:04.050]  I'm not putting a question mark.
[31:04.050 --> 31:05.750]  I'm putting blindside in a different language.
[31:05.970 --> 31:07.170]  Put blindside in Chinese.
[31:07.910 --> 31:10.090]  This is one of those ideas, like Gavin
[31:10.090 --> 31:11.610]  saying that I would bust into his room,
[31:11.890 --> 31:14.030]  I'd say about 60% of those ideas never
[31:14.030 --> 31:16.010]  got made. I was really
[31:16.010 --> 31:17.950]  on the fence about this one, and I've had a lot of time
[31:17.950 --> 31:19.210]  to second guess it since
[31:19.630 --> 31:21.910]  I had the initial idea, because it's about two and a half weeks
[31:21.910 --> 31:22.710]  old now at this point.
[31:23.690 --> 31:26.030]  Is this good enough to release?
[31:26.130 --> 31:27.530]  Is this a good enough idea?
[31:27.630 --> 31:30.070]  Because if you told me no, I would completely understand.
[31:30.270 --> 31:31.970]  I think it's so weird it has to.
[31:31.970 --> 31:33.810]  I think that this opens up
[31:33.810 --> 31:35.770]  opportunities for other things.
[31:35.970 --> 31:36.430]  I agree.
[31:36.730 --> 31:40.210]  I actually had, I'm not going to do it,
[31:40.270 --> 31:41.650]  but I had a double blindside
[31:41.650 --> 31:43.310]  that I initially planned.
[31:43.530 --> 31:45.090]  You can't double blindside.
[31:45.430 --> 31:47.010]  I don't think you can double blindside.
[31:47.010 --> 31:49.550]  I was going to blindside Eric
[31:50.410 --> 31:51.990]  after the episode, with a second
[31:51.990 --> 31:53.770]  episode of a different thing
[31:53.770 --> 31:55.970]  that Eric wouldn't be aware of, so that he was
[31:55.970 --> 31:58.330]  blindsided, but I just figured I was pushing my luck.
[31:58.870 --> 32:00.250]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[32:00.250 --> 32:02.110]  So we can blindside
[32:02.110 --> 32:04.330]  anyone at any time, or just while
[32:04.330 --> 32:06.170]  we're filming? I think it's got to be
[32:06.170 --> 32:07.590]  when we have recordings set.
[32:07.930 --> 32:10.130]  Yeah, I think so. I think you just
[32:10.130 --> 32:12.430]  got to clear with Eric or whatever to make sure
[32:12.870 --> 32:14.090]  we've got the space
[32:14.090 --> 32:14.970]  to do it in.
[32:15.350 --> 32:17.890]  But I don't want it to be a thing where like
[32:17.890 --> 32:20.190]  every time we have to record two episodes
[32:20.190 --> 32:21.510]  everybody goes in expecting
[32:22.110 --> 32:24.110]  somebody's going to blindside somebody. Although maybe
[32:24.110 --> 32:25.570]  that ushers in a new
[32:26.730 --> 32:28.630]  era of a different kind of paranoia
[32:28.630 --> 32:30.730]  which could be interesting. We're definitely getting back into
[32:30.730 --> 32:32.150]  our paranoia era. Yeah.
[32:32.210 --> 32:34.710]  I got some ideas for how to make this
[32:34.710 --> 32:35.970]  blindside work. I got some thoughts.
[32:36.510 --> 32:38.670]  I definitely have the next blindside
[32:38.670 --> 32:40.770]  I want to do, and I'm fucking jazzed
[32:40.770 --> 32:42.710]  to get to it. Do they all have to be
[32:42.710 --> 32:43.970]  AIDS themed? No!
[32:44.270 --> 32:46.070]  No, they don't have to. They could be
[32:46.610 --> 32:48.390]  if you wanted, but they don't have to be.
[32:48.790 --> 32:50.610]  The next one that I'm going to do
[32:51.650 --> 32:52.450]  isn't necessarily
[32:52.450 --> 32:53.230]  AIDS focused.
[32:55.130 --> 32:56.830]  Isn't necessarily, but it might be?
[32:57.250 --> 32:58.670]  I mean, it could
[32:58.670 --> 33:00.010]  encompass a lot of things.
[33:00.150 --> 33:02.930]  But more than anything, I want
[33:02.930 --> 33:04.930]  this, I just want your creative wills
[33:04.930 --> 33:06.910]  turning, because I'm excited
[33:06.910 --> 33:09.110]  to think about what Andrew would blindside me with.
[33:09.570 --> 33:11.070]  But the problem, so now
[33:11.750 --> 33:12.790]  this is how my brain
[33:12.790 --> 33:14.750]  works. Now I'm not expecting it to be
[33:15.370 --> 33:16.890]  ridiculous in any way, or like
[33:16.890 --> 33:18.850]  serious in any way, because you kind of teased
[33:18.850 --> 33:20.810]  it might be serious, so that
[33:20.810 --> 33:22.650]  would no longer be a blindside.
[33:23.090 --> 33:24.950]  If you hit me with another, like if there was a cancer
[33:24.950 --> 33:26.450]  episode of some other show,
[33:26.630 --> 33:29.190]  that wouldn't be a blindside, because I kind of anticipate it.
[33:29.510 --> 33:31.050]  Right. You will not anticipate
[33:31.050 --> 33:32.290]  the next thing I would show.
[33:32.670 --> 33:34.410]  Okay. Interesting.
[33:35.650 --> 33:36.870]  I can't imagine
[33:36.870 --> 33:39.130]  I got some good ideas for a blindside.
[33:39.250 --> 33:40.750]  I gotta figure this out.
[33:40.790 --> 33:43.090]  We don't have to overdo it. We might not do another blindside
[33:43.090 --> 33:45.090]  for six months, but it's out there now.
[33:45.210 --> 33:46.730]  I'm just saying, you know, the wheels are turning.
[33:46.990 --> 33:48.950]  I wanted to blindside the audience
[33:48.950 --> 33:50.610]  and y'all at the same time,
[33:50.610 --> 33:52.870]  and I had a lot of different choices
[33:52.870 --> 33:54.690]  for what I could have gone with that might have been a little
[33:54.690 --> 33:56.190]  funnier and a little more like,
[33:56.810 --> 33:59.130]  you know, uh, Tuxedo,
[33:59.310 --> 34:00.210]  Condor Man,
[34:00.510 --> 34:02.730]  MVP 2 vibes, but I thought
[34:02.730 --> 34:04.810]  going hyper serious in a comedic
[34:04.810 --> 34:06.990]  space would be a little more difficult
[34:06.990 --> 34:09.110]  to navigate. It was more impactful.
[34:09.570 --> 34:10.870]  Yeah, yeah. So,
[34:11.610 --> 34:12.890]  definitely more impactful.
[34:13.530 --> 34:14.990]  I guess, if you would have asked
[34:14.990 --> 34:16.850]  me when I started the day,
[34:16.910 --> 34:19.130]  what are things I would do during this day,
[34:19.250 --> 34:21.110]  Mr. Belvedere would never be on the list.
[34:21.110 --> 34:21.890]  I agree.
[34:24.930 --> 34:26.610]  Man, what a fucking cool character
[34:26.610 --> 34:28.150]  Mr. Belvedere was. Is he?
[34:28.550 --> 34:30.690]  Yeah, man, it's just like an awesome
[34:32.590 --> 34:33.030]  paternal,
[34:33.110 --> 34:34.870]  like, grandfatherly
[34:35.350 --> 34:35.790]  fucking
[34:36.710 --> 34:38.570]  presence in their lives that helps them all
[34:38.570 --> 34:40.390]  keep the train on the tracks, and like,
[34:40.770 --> 34:42.690]  because apparently their dad's useless.
[34:42.990 --> 34:44.510]  Yeah, when he interrupted and totally
[34:44.510 --> 34:46.570]  emasculated the dad in front of the
[34:46.570 --> 34:48.130]  kid, that was great. Yeah.
[34:48.430 --> 34:50.710]  You gotta love that. I think you'll find
[34:50.710 --> 34:52.690]  what your dad means.
[34:53.910 --> 34:54.850]  Mr. Belvedere,
[34:54.970 --> 34:56.670]  he's got a little bit of that British
[34:56.670 --> 34:58.750]  sass in him, you know? Well, he rolls
[34:58.750 --> 35:00.930]  his R's. Is that a...
[35:00.930 --> 35:02.710]  Let me ask you a question. Is he really
[35:02.710 --> 35:04.550]  British? Oh. Like,
[35:04.590 --> 35:05.990]  do you buy him as British?
[35:06.670 --> 35:08.390]  I buy him as, like, a really
[35:09.030 --> 35:10.650]  posh Brit. Okay.
[35:10.670 --> 35:12.490]  I don't think people talk like that necessarily anymore,
[35:12.690 --> 35:14.710]  but I buy him as
[35:14.710 --> 35:16.570]  British. Is he British? His name is
[35:16.570 --> 35:18.630]  Christopher George Hewitt, and
[35:18.630 --> 35:20.650]  he's an English... he was, he's dead, but he
[35:20.650 --> 35:22.750]  was an English actor and theater director.
[35:23.410 --> 35:24.750]  Best known for his role as
[35:24.750 --> 35:26.570]  Lynn Aloysius Belvedere in the
[35:26.570 --> 35:27.990]  ABC sitcom Mr. Belvedere.
[35:28.850 --> 35:30.830]  Aloysius? Yeah, he was born in
[35:31.930 --> 35:32.450]  Sussex.
[35:32.670 --> 35:34.490]  Worthing, Sussex. Okay.
[35:35.510 --> 35:36.890]  And he has a wife.
[35:37.770 --> 35:38.450]  What'd he die of?
[35:39.790 --> 35:40.810]  You will not
[35:40.810 --> 35:41.510]  believe it.
[35:42.250 --> 35:44.670]  A devout Catholic and lifelong bachelor,
[35:44.930 --> 35:46.670]  Hewitt served at St. Victor's Church
[35:46.670 --> 35:48.550]  in West Hollywood. During his later years, he
[35:48.550 --> 35:50.110]  suffered from arthritis and diabetes.
[35:50.630 --> 35:52.790]  He died from complications
[35:52.790 --> 35:53.970]  of diabetes.
[35:54.630 --> 35:56.670]  The arthritis does check out, because it
[35:56.670 --> 35:58.750]  did feel like every time he moved
[35:58.750 --> 36:00.310]  it aged him 17 years.
[36:00.750 --> 36:01.850]  He did not like movement.
[36:02.550 --> 36:04.610]  I'm on his IMDb page
[36:04.610 --> 36:06.630]  right now, because I wanted to see
[36:06.630 --> 36:08.630]  what was up, 1921 and 2001, rest
[36:08.630 --> 36:10.690]  in peace. It's a
[36:10.690 --> 36:12.610]  picture of him as Mr. Belvedere, and
[36:12.610 --> 36:14.650]  there's a video that Otto played right next
[36:14.650 --> 36:16.810]  to it, and it's a trailer for a movie called
[36:16.810 --> 36:18.470]  Rat Boy, where
[36:19.650 --> 36:20.190]  it's a
[36:20.190 --> 36:22.530]  it's just a very rat-looking
[36:22.530 --> 36:24.590]  boy? Like, he
[36:24.590 --> 36:26.130]  looks like a big rat?
[36:26.990 --> 36:28.570]  And he's in it, and he plays like a
[36:28.570 --> 36:30.430]  coach or something, right? It's...
[36:30.430 --> 36:32.670]  yeah, I just don't... it's not what I
[36:32.670 --> 36:34.510]  thought was gonna play when I came to his
[36:34.510 --> 36:36.670]  IMDb page, and he's dead. I didn't think
[36:36.670 --> 36:38.930]  the trailer for Rat Boy...
[36:38.930 --> 36:40.570]  Is that the movie that you're bringing
[36:40.570 --> 36:42.510]  to the table, Eric? Are we gonna watch Rat Boy?
[36:42.510 --> 36:44.850]  No, I don't want to look at this movie.
[36:45.990 --> 36:46.710]  This is...
[36:46.710 --> 36:48.590]  I'm watching the trailer, and I don't want to see it
[36:48.590 --> 36:50.710]  anymore. It was directed by Sandra
[36:50.710 --> 36:52.370]  Locke, who I have recently
[36:52.370 --> 36:54.450]  read a ton about. That's
[36:54.450 --> 36:56.610]  wild. She was, like, a long-time
[36:56.610 --> 36:58.270]  girlfriend of Clint Eastwood,
[36:58.830 --> 37:00.470]  but they never got married. He, like,
[37:00.530 --> 37:02.510]  cheated on his wife with her, and then they were together for
[37:02.510 --> 37:03.950]  like 10 years, and he bought her a house,
[37:04.370 --> 37:06.470]  and he put her in a bunch of his movies. Like, I just watched
[37:06.470 --> 37:08.590]  the movie Any Which Way You
[37:08.590 --> 37:10.530]  Can, or Every Which Way...
[37:10.530 --> 37:12.630]  One of those two, Every Which Way But Loose, where he's got the
[37:12.630 --> 37:14.350]  orangutan Clyde that punches people,
[37:14.810 --> 37:16.510]  Clint Eastwood, and she was in that. That's where they
[37:16.510 --> 37:18.490]  fell in love. And then he
[37:18.490 --> 37:20.370]  ended up cheating on her with
[37:20.370 --> 37:22.690]  another woman, and started a family
[37:22.690 --> 37:24.550]  with her, and then threw her out
[37:24.550 --> 37:26.530]  of the house, and left her with nothing,
[37:26.730 --> 37:28.570]  and she had to sue him, and
[37:28.570 --> 37:30.330]  there was this, like, crazy lawsuit,
[37:30.590 --> 37:32.550]  and she ended up... he ended up, like...
[37:32.550 --> 37:34.770]  she ended up, like, backing off the lawsuit,
[37:35.590 --> 37:35.990]  because
[37:36.910 --> 37:38.610]  he gave her... he helped her
[37:38.610 --> 37:40.430]  get a directing deal
[37:40.430 --> 37:42.570]  in Hollywood, like a three-picture deal, which
[37:42.570 --> 37:44.490]  is all she wanted to do was direct, and then
[37:45.410 --> 37:46.470]  she had to deal for, like,
[37:46.510 --> 37:48.530]  three years, and then they wouldn't greenlight any of her
[37:48.530 --> 37:50.110]  movies, and then she died of cancer.
[37:50.430 --> 37:52.650]  Oh my god! Wow. It was like
[37:52.650 --> 37:54.530]  she got... like, the whole back half of her life got
[37:54.530 --> 37:56.510]  completely fucked over by Clint Eastwood,
[37:56.630 --> 37:58.730]  pretty much. I will say,
[37:59.890 --> 38:00.730]  Belvedere... he didn't
[38:00.730 --> 38:02.490]  have a lot of screen time for being the titular
[38:02.490 --> 38:04.610]  character. He didn't. Well, this was
[38:04.610 --> 38:06.630]  a very special episode. He also
[38:06.630 --> 38:08.570]  wasn't in a lot of things. I'm surprised. He's only in
[38:08.570 --> 38:10.450]  25 credits for IMDb.
[38:11.150 --> 38:12.810]  And out of those 25 credits,
[38:12.810 --> 38:14.810]  he's in The Elephant Man and Rat Boy,
[38:14.950 --> 38:16.310]  so he really... he had a thing.
[38:16.630 --> 38:18.590]  He really liked a specific
[38:18.590 --> 38:20.610]  genre. He was in a lot of TV,
[38:20.770 --> 38:22.410]  like, he was in Fantasy Island,
[38:22.910 --> 38:24.710]  he was in The Mike Hammer Show, he was
[38:24.710 --> 38:26.490]  in Murder, She Wrote, he was in
[38:26.490 --> 38:28.790]  Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego. Nice.
[38:29.250 --> 38:31.050]  He was in California Dreams,
[38:31.290 --> 38:32.530]  he was in... Hell yeah!
[38:32.710 --> 38:34.450]  The Jackie Gleason Show,
[38:34.450 --> 38:36.750]  and he almost always played
[38:36.750 --> 38:38.290]  a butler, I feel like.
[38:38.850 --> 38:40.570]  Huh. That's what we do.
[38:41.670 --> 38:42.470]  Like, he was
[38:42.470 --> 38:44.450]  in a made...
[38:44.450 --> 38:46.390]  He was in an ABC Afterschool special where he
[38:46.390 --> 38:47.130]  played the butler
[38:48.730 --> 38:50.390]  in an episode called Seven Wishes
[38:50.390 --> 38:52.210]  of a Rich Kid. I don't know what the fuck that is.
[38:53.010 --> 38:53.810]  Interesting career.
[38:55.630 --> 38:56.430]  So, we'll
[38:56.430 --> 38:58.390]  have to discuss Blindside and how exactly
[38:58.390 --> 39:00.390]  we want to do it. I think we have it figured out.
[39:00.950 --> 39:01.350]  Mostly.
[39:02.690 --> 39:03.050]  Yeah.
[39:04.450 --> 39:05.430]  This is definitely something.
[39:07.030 --> 39:07.690]  I'm kind of
[39:07.690 --> 39:09.250]  speechless as to what we watched. I feel the same.
[39:09.710 --> 39:11.490]  Yeah. I was going for a little bit
[39:11.490 --> 39:12.990]  of shock and a little bit of awe.
[39:13.330 --> 39:14.130]  There's a lot of that.
[39:15.790 --> 39:17.850]  This is great. This is a very successful
[39:17.850 --> 39:19.470]  Blindside, Geoff. I'd say you nailed it.
[39:19.770 --> 39:21.310]  I was also going for a
[39:22.210 --> 39:23.410]  little bit more of a helping
[39:23.410 --> 39:25.470]  of comedy on top of those two things.
[39:25.630 --> 39:27.590]  I don't know if we delivered, but I hope we did
[39:27.590 --> 39:28.370]  in some capacity.
[39:29.630 --> 39:30.690]  It's a big ask.
[39:30.950 --> 39:31.450]  I know.
[39:32.070 --> 39:34.110]  Drop a kid's AIDS diagnosis
[39:34.110 --> 39:36.370]  and is like, you know what, I think we'll pepper in some good...
[39:36.370 --> 39:37.890]  I feel they failed as well.
[39:38.370 --> 39:40.230]  Without being disrespectful to the
[39:40.230 --> 39:42.170]  disease or to the people that suffer from it.
[39:42.330 --> 39:43.510]  Right. No, it's definitely
[39:45.110 --> 39:45.510]  a
[39:47.410 --> 39:48.210]  difficult task
[39:48.210 --> 39:49.290]  to undertake.
[39:49.490 --> 39:52.210]  They just get to it in like the first
[39:52.210 --> 39:54.410]  four minutes. I think it's part of why
[39:54.410 --> 39:56.670]  I wanted to show it to you guys. It's just so...
[39:56.670 --> 39:57.950]  It's presented so
[39:58.830 --> 40:00.550]  ludicrously and in such a shocking
[40:00.550 --> 40:02.490]  way. Yeah. That kid
[40:02.490 --> 40:04.730]  walks in and he's like, pretty good, I got AIDS.
[40:04.970 --> 40:06.890]  Anyway, and you're just like, what?
[40:07.410 --> 40:08.550]  I bet a lot of people watching at home
[40:08.550 --> 40:10.890]  just spit all over their dinner. Oh, yeah.
[40:11.290 --> 40:12.050]  Do you think
[40:12.610 --> 40:14.590]  there were more or less than a hundred
[40:14.590 --> 40:15.670]  thousand spit takes?
[40:16.530 --> 40:17.870]  Oh, way more. Across the country.
[40:18.250 --> 40:20.330]  Way more. Because this is back
[40:21.090 --> 40:22.710]  when shows got numbers.
[40:23.050 --> 40:24.610]  This is back when a sitcom like that
[40:24.610 --> 40:26.710]  would pull in like 15-20 million
[40:26.710 --> 40:27.770]  people. Yeah.
[40:28.410 --> 40:30.570]  Back when there was much less to watch. If I
[40:30.570 --> 40:32.470]  send you a link, could you share your screen for a minute,
[40:32.610 --> 40:34.630]  Eric? This reminded me of
[40:34.630 --> 40:36.690]  something I saw. Yeah, do you want to just send it in the chat
[40:36.690 --> 40:38.710]  here? Yeah, I'll just post it in the chat and then
[40:38.710 --> 40:40.350]  we can watch it through you so we're synced.
[40:41.090 --> 40:42.470]  This is something that came up. I think it's
[40:42.470 --> 40:44.110]  another great display of like
[40:44.110 --> 40:45.570]  the strange
[40:47.350 --> 40:48.570]  specificity of like TV
[40:48.570 --> 40:49.990]  of that time. Yes.
[40:50.650 --> 40:52.610]  This is definitely what I was talking about
[40:52.610 --> 40:54.770]  when it's this kind of thing.
[40:54.850 --> 40:55.930]  Hang on, let me get this
[40:56.670 --> 40:57.930]  screen shared here.
[41:00.090 --> 41:00.690]  This is
[41:00.690 --> 41:02.650]  definitely like the example that
[41:02.650 --> 41:04.410]  I would use for this. Okay.
[41:04.750 --> 41:06.410]  And here it comes.
[41:06.610 --> 41:08.330]  And here we go. And here it goes.
[41:08.490 --> 41:10.550]  Hang on now. Here we go. Okay. Three, two,
[41:10.670 --> 41:11.050]  one.
[41:18.470 --> 41:19.990]  That's a great documentary.
[41:19.990 --> 41:22.030]  I've seen that documentary.
[41:22.570 --> 41:23.730]  I love that
[41:23.730 --> 41:26.350]  teasing of like these serious themes.
[41:28.130 --> 41:29.210]  It's really something.
[41:30.530 --> 41:31.930]  Just mixed in.
[41:32.490 --> 41:34.170]  It's so... it's great.
[41:34.490 --> 41:36.110]  You never do
[41:36.110 --> 41:37.830]  what you were getting when you tuned into
[41:37.830 --> 41:40.110]  your sitcom. Like you're like, ah, I'm
[41:40.110 --> 41:41.950]  going to turn on Tim the Toolman
[41:41.950 --> 41:44.250]  Taylor. Is he going to supercharge
[41:44.250 --> 41:45.990]  his lawnmower with a
[41:46.910 --> 41:47.830]  jet engine this week?
[41:47.830 --> 41:49.890]  Oh no, his kid's dying. Oh lord.
[41:50.050 --> 41:51.750]  Oh, I thought it was going to be related to the
[41:51.750 --> 41:53.790]  dishwasher, but they didn't let
[41:53.790 --> 41:54.950]  that breathe at all.
[41:58.530 --> 41:59.790]  It's in like the
[41:59.790 --> 42:01.870]  TV trope thing of like
[42:01.870 --> 42:03.970]  very special episode is like such
[42:03.970 --> 42:05.570]  a thing.
[42:06.430 --> 42:07.830]  I pulled up the IMDb
[42:07.830 --> 42:09.610]  for the actor that played Danny. He's in like
[42:09.610 --> 42:11.910]  20-ish things. A lot of them are
[42:11.910 --> 42:13.390]  sitcoms, one episode roles.
[42:13.670 --> 42:15.710]  Do you think that's the worst thing that happened to him
[42:15.710 --> 42:17.730]  as a character he played? Or do you think
[42:17.730 --> 42:19.810]  he played a string of characters that all
[42:19.810 --> 42:21.790]  died in horrific ways
[42:21.790 --> 42:23.730]  as like educational tools? That's a
[42:23.730 --> 42:25.750]  great question. I think I'm going to try to
[42:25.750 --> 42:27.870]  watch every episode that that
[42:27.870 --> 42:30.190]  actor worked for sitcoms.
[42:30.390 --> 42:31.570]  Andrew's blindsides
[42:31.570 --> 42:33.790]  are just going to be that actor in stuff.
[42:33.950 --> 42:35.530]  I mean, that's totally
[42:36.490 --> 42:37.790]  that would be totally regulation
[42:37.790 --> 42:38.270]  blindside.
[42:40.070 --> 42:40.990]  Completely allowable.
[42:41.970 --> 42:43.310]  Thank you so much, Geoff, for
[42:43.310 --> 42:45.270]  I'm sorry I accidentally delayed this.
[42:45.330 --> 42:47.550]  No problem, guys. It's better that you did
[42:47.550 --> 42:48.870]  because it drug out longer.
[42:49.370 --> 42:51.310]  Let me just say, I'm glad
[42:51.310 --> 42:53.330]  that it went. It went about as well as I could
[42:53.330 --> 42:55.230]  have hoped. It didn't go as bad as I feared.
[42:55.390 --> 42:57.490]  I'll say that. And I'm happy
[42:58.490 --> 42:59.450]  to have
[42:59.450 --> 43:01.790]  birthed into our universe
[43:01.790 --> 43:02.870]  a show
[43:02.870 --> 43:05.250]  with which you can now use to fuck
[43:05.250 --> 43:06.910]  me over. Oh, it's great.
[43:07.210 --> 43:09.390]  And I can't wait to see the audience reaction to this.
[43:09.750 --> 43:10.570]  Yeah, everybody
[43:10.570 --> 43:12.530]  everybody, all five of us
[43:12.530 --> 43:14.630]  are able to blindside whenever
[43:15.530 --> 43:16.670]  it makes sense to
[43:16.670 --> 43:18.390]  the schedule. You just got to go through it,
[43:18.590 --> 43:20.630]  I guess. So can we do two episodes next
[43:20.630 --> 43:21.970]  week? Yeah.
[43:22.550 --> 43:24.530]  Yes. Because we do still
[43:24.530 --> 43:25.470]  need to do two episodes.
[43:26.090 --> 43:28.770]  Okay, I'm sending the invite. Thank you.
[43:28.870 --> 43:29.530]  Just making sure.
[43:30.190 --> 43:32.790]  Eric, did you change today's calendar invite to blindside?
[43:33.030 --> 43:33.790]  Just now, yeah.
[43:34.230 --> 43:36.530]  Do you think it's going to be like, Gavin, this
[43:36.530 --> 43:38.570]  will only apply to you and I, but do you think it's going to be
[43:38.570 --> 43:40.390]  like when Achievement Hunter
[43:40.390 --> 43:42.450]  would play GTA, and you would
[43:42.450 --> 43:44.490]  call up Lamar to send somebody to
[43:44.490 --> 43:46.550]  mug you, and
[43:46.550 --> 43:48.530]  Lamar would be like, can't do it, homie.
[43:48.910 --> 43:50.630]  Somebody else is already on the way to mug
[43:50.630 --> 43:52.610]  him. You think we're going to just be stacking up
[43:52.610 --> 43:54.570]  blindsides? Just never going to be able
[43:54.570 --> 43:55.130]  to find a window?
[44:01.380 --> 44:03.220]  Alright, we should
[44:03.880 --> 44:05.720]  wrap up this blindside and
[44:06.380 --> 44:07.840]  really something, really
[44:09.340 --> 44:09.800]  Geoff,
[44:09.900 --> 44:11.340]  anything you want to say as the
[44:12.140 --> 44:13.220]  starter of the blindside?
[44:13.540 --> 44:15.960]  Thanks for listening to the inaugural episode of the blindside.
[44:16.580 --> 44:18.000]  We hope to see more
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.120]  and guess what?
[44:20.300 --> 44:21.840]  You just got fucking blindsided!
