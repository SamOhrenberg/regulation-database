[00:16.090 --> 00:19.430]  Matt Dickinson wants it in his GERPLER hole.
[00:21.050 --> 00:22.110]  That's what it says.
[00:23.110 --> 00:25.090]  Anyone else up GERPin'?
[00:25.090 --> 00:26.270]  GERP, GERP, GERP.
[00:26.610 --> 00:27.550]  Hastin' right now.
[00:30.590 --> 00:32.350]  Somebody said it's gonna go out at 11.04.
[00:32.490 --> 00:34.970]  It can't because it's not gonna go on sale until 11.10.
[00:35.030 --> 00:38.270]  Hello and welcome to The Break Show.
[00:38.430 --> 00:40.250]  A very special break show.
[00:41.170 --> 00:42.690]  I'm your host, Geoff Ramsey.
[00:42.990 --> 00:44.170]  With me, as always,
[00:44.170 --> 00:46.590]  this one, Eric Baudour,
[00:46.790 --> 00:49.430]  and then this other one, on occasion, not always,
[00:49.610 --> 00:51.050]  but sometimes, Emily Hatfield.
[00:51.910 --> 00:52.290]  Not...
[00:53.210 --> 00:54.070]  There you go.
[00:54.330 --> 00:55.510]  I was waiting for her to have some sort of reaction.
[00:55.510 --> 00:56.350]  I'm not warmed up yet.
[00:56.970 --> 00:57.730]  It's been a while.
[00:57.810 --> 00:58.710]  When was the last time you did one of these?
[00:59.670 --> 01:00.430]  Oh, months.
[01:00.530 --> 01:02.450]  We keep scheduling the Mondays that you're very busy.
[01:02.590 --> 01:02.830]  Yes.
[01:03.430 --> 01:04.530]  Hopefully that changes.
[01:05.930 --> 01:07.110]  Hopefully that does change.
[01:07.750 --> 01:08.830]  Okay, so we're doing this,
[01:08.870 --> 01:10.290]  as Howard would say,
[01:10.450 --> 01:11.430]  we're not doing this for our health.
[01:11.570 --> 01:11.990]  It's true.
[01:11.990 --> 01:14.650]  We're doing this to promote the sale of,
[01:14.770 --> 01:15.610]  throw it my way,
[01:16.390 --> 01:17.370]  of the Gerpler.
[01:17.510 --> 01:19.650]  It's coming out in just a few minutes.
[01:19.670 --> 01:20.930]  11.10 a.m.
[01:20.950 --> 01:22.230]  This is the purple variety.
[01:22.510 --> 01:23.790]  Last time we did this, about a month ago,
[01:23.830 --> 01:26.110]  we previewed the green and the purple and the gold.
[01:26.310 --> 01:27.450]  Today, we just have the purple.
[01:27.510 --> 01:29.230]  Well, it's because they're all going on sale
[01:29.230 --> 01:31.270]  and we don't have enough to show you.
[01:31.430 --> 01:32.150]  So here's the thing.
[01:32.330 --> 01:32.630]  Here's the thing.
[01:32.730 --> 01:33.430]  They're all blind box.
[01:33.910 --> 01:34.550]  You're gonna go,
[01:35.970 --> 01:36.930]  it's a limit of four.
[01:37.470 --> 01:39.810]  You can buy four at a time,
[01:39.910 --> 01:40.550]  unlimited orders,
[01:40.650 --> 01:41.330]  but I'm just letting you know
[01:41.330 --> 01:42.390]  you can only buy four at a time.
[01:42.670 --> 01:44.190]  You don't pick what you get
[01:44.190 --> 01:45.230]  because you might get green,
[01:45.710 --> 01:46.450]  you might get purple,
[01:46.870 --> 01:51.910]  but you might get one of the 10 golden Gerplers
[01:51.910 --> 01:55.990]  that we have exclusive for this sale.
[01:56.110 --> 01:57.890]  Geoff, what's inside the golden Gerpler?
[01:59.130 --> 02:00.510]  All kinds of goodies.
[02:00.830 --> 02:01.150]  What?
[02:01.390 --> 02:02.290]  No, one goody.
[02:02.290 --> 02:02.870]  There's one goody.
[02:02.910 --> 02:04.930]  One goody, but it's all kinds of fun.
[02:05.070 --> 02:07.130]  It's a USB drive.
[02:07.430 --> 02:09.050]  You remember those from back in the old days
[02:09.050 --> 02:11.310]  when we used to carry stuff around on little sticks?
[02:11.410 --> 02:11.690]  Yep.
[02:11.690 --> 02:12.850]  We've got our own stick now.
[02:13.450 --> 02:14.470]  Fuckface got a stick,
[02:14.730 --> 02:16.470]  and it's got a Fuckface logo on it,
[02:16.630 --> 02:18.210]  and then if you plug that into a computer,
[02:18.830 --> 02:19.590]  the right way,
[02:19.850 --> 02:20.750]  I never get it right.
[02:20.770 --> 02:21.570]  Well, you put it the right way,
[02:21.590 --> 02:22.370]  then the wrong way, then the right way.
[02:22.370 --> 02:22.770]  The right way, yeah.
[02:22.770 --> 02:23.550]  The right way, wrong way, right way.
[02:23.750 --> 02:24.690]  Then you put that in,
[02:24.870 --> 02:25.250]  and then you,
[02:25.710 --> 02:27.530]  and you go and you access that drive.
[02:27.650 --> 02:30.690]  There's gonna be a very, very, very exclusive,
[02:31.330 --> 02:32.950]  only 10 copies in existence,
[02:35.270 --> 02:36.890]  11 minute long Fuckface video.
[02:37.250 --> 02:38.430]  I can't say what's on it.
[02:38.430 --> 02:38.630]  Nope.
[02:38.790 --> 02:39.890]  I can't say what we do,
[02:40.010 --> 02:41.950]  but I can say it's a video,
[02:42.350 --> 02:44.210]  and there's stuff happening on it.
[02:44.290 --> 02:46.430]  They're individually watermarked.
[02:46.490 --> 02:46.690]  Yes.
[02:46.850 --> 02:49.410]  So we'll know if you release it,
[02:49.530 --> 02:50.970]  which is your choice to do.
[02:51.010 --> 02:51.770]  You own that video.
[02:51.770 --> 02:52.410]  That's yours.
[02:52.610 --> 02:53.090]  It's your video.
[02:53.250 --> 02:54.470]  But we'll know that it was you.
[02:54.670 --> 02:55.330]  We'll know that it was you.
[02:55.330 --> 02:56.910]  We'll know it was you.
[02:57.350 --> 02:58.570]  Now you have to weigh the options.
[02:58.730 --> 03:00.170]  Do I want them to know that it was me?
[03:00.210 --> 03:00.850]  Maybe you do.
[03:00.990 --> 03:02.490]  Maybe you want to flex like that.
[03:02.730 --> 03:03.510]  Maybe you don't.
[03:03.570 --> 03:06.250]  Maybe you prefer to live a life of anonymity.
[03:06.430 --> 03:07.770]  A lot of people do that these days.
[03:07.770 --> 03:09.810]  It's going to be a little bit harder because it's watermarked.
[03:10.150 --> 03:14.010]  Or maybe you want to be the Robin Hood, if you will, of the community
[03:14.010 --> 03:16.030]  and share it with the world at large.
[03:16.230 --> 03:18.250]  Seven and a half billion people on Earth.
[03:18.490 --> 03:21.090]  Only ten initially get access to this video.
[03:21.350 --> 03:21.690]  We don't even have it.
[03:21.710 --> 03:24.730]  So you want the rest of the seven and a half billion people to see it.
[03:25.050 --> 03:25.790]  That's up to you.
[03:25.910 --> 03:26.830]  You have that power.
[03:27.210 --> 03:29.190]  It's, you know, like Spider-Man says,
[03:29.250 --> 03:30.170]  great power, great responsibility.
[03:30.430 --> 03:30.550]  Yep.
[03:31.230 --> 03:31.950]  And I'm Uncle Ben.
[03:32.070 --> 03:34.770]  So at the same time we have the Gerplers going on sale,
[03:35.490 --> 03:36.410]  get a sleeve.
[03:36.410 --> 03:37.710]  It's the Koozler.
[03:38.170 --> 03:38.470]  Yeah.
[03:38.650 --> 03:39.950]  Can you believe we made it?
[03:40.010 --> 03:40.410]  I can't.
[03:41.310 --> 03:46.150]  It's a real thing that truly only fits the Gerplers.
[03:46.250 --> 03:47.150]  You know why we made it?
[03:47.530 --> 03:48.490]  Because I thought of it.
[03:48.650 --> 03:51.330]  I thought of it right here in my brain, my merchandise brain,
[03:51.370 --> 03:52.850]  and I said, what's better?
[03:53.030 --> 03:54.310]  Like, I'm a koozie guy.
[03:54.370 --> 03:54.910]  You know that, right?
[03:55.090 --> 03:56.210]  As a matter of fact, I'm going to even,
[03:56.490 --> 03:57.810]  I don't even know if I'm allowed to talk about this,
[03:57.830 --> 04:00.090]  but I'm going to launch my own line of koozies.
[04:00.250 --> 04:01.890]  Like a koozie of the month club.
[04:01.930 --> 04:02.130]  Wow.
[04:02.130 --> 04:03.390]  Just for, like, the Geoff line.
[04:03.670 --> 04:06.150]  I'm going to transition away from T-shirts and all that other stuff.
[04:06.150 --> 04:07.630]  To a koozie of the month club.
[04:07.770 --> 04:11.730]  This is, seems like it would make us less money.
[04:12.030 --> 04:13.330]  Yeah, it's not going to make any money.
[04:13.710 --> 04:14.890]  That's why it's going to be on the Geoff line.
[04:14.990 --> 04:17.510]  It's not going to be fuckface production.
[04:17.870 --> 04:18.270]  Possibly.
[04:18.830 --> 04:20.330]  There's profit margin on koozies.
[04:20.910 --> 04:21.450]  Non-existent.
[04:21.670 --> 04:21.790]  Zero.
[04:22.070 --> 04:22.290]  Yeah.
[04:22.690 --> 04:24.830]  But you've got to go with your passion, right?
[04:24.950 --> 04:26.510]  We'll figure out the money side later.
[04:26.630 --> 04:26.870]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:26.950 --> 04:29.190]  And then I was looking at the greatest cup ever made.
[04:29.290 --> 04:29.730]  It's been saying that for 20 years.
[04:29.870 --> 04:30.430]  The goobler.
[04:30.890 --> 04:31.510]  The goobler.
[04:31.810 --> 04:32.790]  The goobler.
[04:33.070 --> 04:34.670]  The Gerplers going on sale.
[04:34.670 --> 04:35.210]  That's a squirt bottle.
[04:35.210 --> 04:36.950]  The greatest cup ever made, the Gerpler.
[04:37.230 --> 04:38.790]  And I thought there's no koozie for the Gerpler.
[04:38.950 --> 04:41.050]  My own koozies I won't be able to use on my own Gerpler.
[04:41.390 --> 04:45.210]  So we invented, we saw a need, much like a uniform does.
[04:45.250 --> 04:47.010]  Uniform, combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm uniform.
[04:47.870 --> 04:50.230]  We created a solution.
[04:50.430 --> 04:54.190]  We also created card sleeves that you can get.
[04:54.310 --> 04:55.210]  These are...
[04:55.210 --> 04:55.730]  Useless.
[04:57.430 --> 05:00.310]  These are card sleeves for your cards.
[05:00.470 --> 05:03.070]  So you can also collect and get these.
[05:03.130 --> 05:04.690]  Keep them safe and only see half of them.
[05:06.890 --> 05:08.930]  So the Gerplers are going to go on sale.
[05:09.070 --> 05:10.730]  There's also a shirt, but we don't have the shirt.
[05:11.210 --> 05:12.330]  Nobody wore it today.
[05:12.670 --> 05:15.390]  And somebody stole the rest of them.
[05:15.670 --> 05:16.890]  That's the real problem.
[05:17.330 --> 05:20.010]  The fuckface merch, the fuckface merch is so hot.
[05:20.630 --> 05:25.790]  Even within our own company of Rooster Teeth, there are grubby little thieve hands everywhere.
[05:25.870 --> 05:26.790]  Do you know what happened last...
[05:26.790 --> 05:32.670]  When we put this on sale, it was just a litany of people last time who were here going, hey can I get one of those?
[05:32.670 --> 05:35.790]  There was a line, while we were filming, there was a line of people watching.
[05:36.330 --> 05:37.910]  And as soon as it was over, everybody wanted it.
[05:38.130 --> 05:38.910]  Guess who got it?
[05:39.530 --> 05:39.850]  Nobody.
[05:40.150 --> 05:41.990]  Because they were standing around here instead of fucking around.
[05:41.990 --> 05:43.630]  But we are reprinting them and they should be out in September.
[05:43.790 --> 05:45.870]  September. That's a great point. Thank you for bringing that up, Eric.
[05:46.630 --> 05:49.170]  Should we kick this off with maybe opening up a pack?
[05:49.170 --> 05:52.690]  Five minutes until this all goes on sale and then you complain, but not to me.
[05:54.410 --> 05:55.650]  I think we have a new rule.
[05:55.910 --> 05:56.470]  Complain to Gavin.
[05:56.810 --> 05:57.210]  Yeah, that's fine.
[05:58.090 --> 05:59.190]  CTG is what we decided.
[05:59.790 --> 06:00.930]  Complain to Gavin.
[06:01.710 --> 06:02.350]  Any issues...
[06:02.350 --> 06:07.490]  Could be merch related, could be content related, could be something going on in your personal life.
[06:07.530 --> 06:08.810]  Maybe you don't like your boss.
[06:09.070 --> 06:11.430]  Maybe your grandmother, kind of a dick.
[06:11.750 --> 06:13.310]  Maybe you've got a racist neighbor.
[06:13.490 --> 06:16.690]  I don't know, but if you want to complain about them, complain to Gavin.
[06:16.830 --> 06:17.250]  CTG.
[06:17.430 --> 06:17.650]  Okay.
[06:18.030 --> 06:19.290]  Here comes the pack sack.
[06:19.430 --> 06:20.530]  Here we go, pack sack.
[06:20.990 --> 06:23.450]  Oh, it's transposed because it's backwards on the camera.
[06:23.550 --> 06:25.670]  It does say pack sack, but you know how it gets flipped?
[06:26.070 --> 06:26.230]  Nope.
[06:26.690 --> 06:27.690]  Yeah, that's how that works.
[06:28.150 --> 06:28.910]  What's it gonna be?
[06:29.070 --> 06:30.510]  Oh, today we have...
[06:30.510 --> 06:32.150]  Sorry, it looks almost half open.
[06:32.370 --> 06:32.490]  Yeah!
[06:32.690 --> 06:34.310]  We're gonna open up ALF cards!
[06:34.710 --> 06:35.410]  Yeah, ALF cards!
[06:36.170 --> 06:37.810]  ALF alien life form!
[06:38.250 --> 06:40.870]  Did you ever see that movie Permanent Midnight about the guy who made ALF?
[06:41.190 --> 06:42.310]  It was Ben Stiller was in it.
[06:42.370 --> 06:44.210]  It was all about his drug addiction while he was making ALF.
[06:44.290 --> 06:44.810]  No, that's awesome.
[06:44.870 --> 06:45.910]  I was a fucking lunatic.
[06:46.050 --> 06:46.470]  That's cool.
[06:46.570 --> 06:46.870]  It was alright.
[06:48.430 --> 06:50.250]  Very 90s independent film, early 2000s.
[06:50.270 --> 06:51.630]  I got a text message from Joey and Fabrics.
[06:51.770 --> 06:52.390]  Oh, nice!
[06:52.530 --> 06:53.210]  Are they having a sale?
[06:53.250 --> 06:54.210]  I'd say $5, yeah.
[06:55.070 --> 06:55.430]  Wow.
[06:56.950 --> 06:57.670]  Booyah Baseball!
[06:57.850 --> 06:58.210]  What?
[06:59.210 --> 06:59.930]  Rosenblum Phantoms.
[07:00.070 --> 07:02.850]  That's, I guess, maybe one of the baseball teams on Melmac.
[07:03.610 --> 07:06.250]  If you don't know, ALF is from the planet Melmac.
[07:06.390 --> 07:07.170]  What does it say?
[07:07.390 --> 07:08.310]  Try Catsicle?
[07:08.550 --> 07:09.250]  Try Catsicle.
[07:09.410 --> 07:09.730]  Oh, okay.
[07:10.190 --> 07:10.950]  For Booyah Baseball.
[07:10.950 --> 07:11.770]  Oh, they like eat cats.
[07:11.950 --> 07:12.390]  I forgot to say that.
[07:12.390 --> 07:12.430]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:12.430 --> 07:12.830]  They love...
[07:12.830 --> 07:13.850]  Would it be like seasoning?
[07:13.990 --> 07:14.950]  Because it's like Booyah Base?
[07:15.570 --> 07:17.350]  Yeah, but that's just the name of the team, Booyah Baseball.
[07:17.370 --> 07:18.550]  Everything's food related for ALF.
[07:19.330 --> 07:20.050]  There's a...
[07:20.050 --> 07:23.590]  Here is what your completed red border picture will look like.
[07:23.690 --> 07:24.470]  Collect all the cards.
[07:24.590 --> 07:25.130]  Oh, that's...
[07:25.130 --> 07:25.770]  Oh, I see.
[07:25.830 --> 07:27.410]  The little puzzle that they want you to make.
[07:27.410 --> 07:27.970]  We should...
[07:28.450 --> 07:28.770]  No.
[07:29.090 --> 07:30.750]  We should try to create...
[07:30.750 --> 07:30.790]  Yes.
[07:30.790 --> 07:32.150]  We should try to complete...
[07:32.150 --> 07:33.070]  All right, here's our first...
[07:33.070 --> 07:33.750]  We're going to go weekly.
[07:34.050 --> 07:35.170]  We're going weekly at some point.
[07:35.450 --> 07:36.490]  This is going to be our first...
[07:36.490 --> 07:36.730]  Yeah.
[07:37.270 --> 07:37.590]  ...collection.
[07:37.710 --> 07:37.870]  Okay.
[07:37.930 --> 07:38.690]  Our first fuckface collection.
[07:38.750 --> 07:39.070]  Official.
[07:39.410 --> 07:39.550]  Yeah.
[07:39.550 --> 07:43.150]  We're going to collect and then frame the ALF poster.
[07:43.350 --> 07:43.870]  Should I save it?
[07:44.010 --> 07:45.050]  Yeah, why don't you save the ALF?
[07:45.390 --> 07:47.610]  I'm going to save that and put it in a semi-useless sleeve.
[07:47.670 --> 07:47.850]  Okay.
[07:48.530 --> 07:50.910]  As the karate experts say...
[07:50.910 --> 07:51.390]  Ouch.
[07:52.410 --> 07:55.550]  Do you remember when Cousin Willie did crack with a bunch of dudes in his underwear?
[07:57.030 --> 07:58.990]  Why didn't you say it in an ALF voice?
[07:59.310 --> 08:00.910]  I don't have a good ALF voice.
[08:01.090 --> 08:01.450]  Try it.
[08:01.530 --> 08:02.130]  Come on.
[08:02.550 --> 08:02.910]  I can't.
[08:02.910 --> 08:04.050]  It's like lower, right?
[08:04.070 --> 08:04.590]  Yeah, you do it.
[08:04.690 --> 08:05.550]  I haven't heard ALF.
[08:05.550 --> 08:05.910]  You do it.
[08:05.950 --> 08:06.570]  You grew up with it.
[08:06.910 --> 08:08.090]  Take that card away real quick.
[08:08.250 --> 08:08.990]  Nobody wants to be ALF.
[08:11.810 --> 08:13.150]  You have to show me the card.
[08:13.170 --> 08:14.050]  I can't see the card.
[08:14.890 --> 08:15.450]  There you go.
[08:15.970 --> 08:17.550]  As the karate experts say...
[08:18.930 --> 08:19.290]  Ouch.
[08:20.330 --> 08:20.690]  Okay.
[08:20.850 --> 08:21.290]  Is that pretty good?
[08:21.310 --> 08:23.150]  It's sort of somewhere between ALF and Andrew Dice Clay.
[08:23.630 --> 08:23.850]  Yeah.
[08:24.470 --> 08:25.090]  ALF man.
[08:25.770 --> 08:26.210]  Ow.
[08:28.070 --> 08:29.530]  Boy, we were watching some classic...
[08:29.530 --> 08:30.090]  We watched the...
[08:31.170 --> 08:32.050]  Benji and...
[08:32.050 --> 08:34.310]  Benji and Dice Clay fight.
[08:34.410 --> 08:35.250]  Oh, yeah.
[08:35.410 --> 08:35.910]  Oh, man.
[08:36.010 --> 08:36.270]  Nice.
[08:36.450 --> 08:37.030]  That's so great.
[08:37.050 --> 08:37.450]  Two minutes.
[08:37.970 --> 08:38.390]  Two...
[08:38.390 --> 08:39.670]  A Topps picture card series.
[08:39.710 --> 08:40.570]  Second series ALF.
[08:40.670 --> 08:41.150]  Six six cards.
[08:41.210 --> 08:42.890]  That's just a promo for what it is.
[08:42.990 --> 08:43.210]  Okay.
[08:44.050 --> 08:44.850]  Here's another one.
[08:45.390 --> 08:46.590]  Oh, he likes to watch.
[08:47.070 --> 08:48.430]  Hey, I told you to be careful.
[08:48.830 --> 08:51.230]  But with those Velcro eyebrows.
[08:51.370 --> 08:51.810]  That's funny.
[08:51.810 --> 08:52.390]  You did awesome.
[08:52.610 --> 08:53.050]  That sucks.
[08:53.050 --> 08:56.130]  Is there such a thing as being too cool?
[08:56.910 --> 08:56.990]  Wow.
[08:56.990 --> 08:57.130]  Wow.
[08:58.010 --> 08:59.030]  ALF in sunglasses.
[08:59.610 --> 09:00.890]  Classic 80s stuff right there.
[09:01.130 --> 09:01.510]  That's good.
[09:01.810 --> 09:02.050]  That's good.
[09:02.170 --> 09:02.710]  That's a vibe.
[09:02.890 --> 09:03.790]  Geoff, we have one minute.
[09:04.050 --> 09:04.910]  Yeah, we have one minute.
[09:04.910 --> 09:05.690]  Until this stuff goes on sale.
[09:05.750 --> 09:07.330]  You go to store.roosterteeth.com.
[09:08.610 --> 09:12.110]  Whatever you're going to do to go to the website to buy this stuff, you're going to tell me
[09:12.110 --> 09:12.650]  that it was wrong.
[09:12.750 --> 09:13.590]  I don't know how to help you.
[09:13.850 --> 09:16.510]  Just go to store.roosterteeth.com and you can buy all these things.
[09:16.590 --> 09:19.030]  Remember, limit of four on the Gerplers.
[09:19.210 --> 09:19.970]  Isn't that incredible?
[09:20.210 --> 09:21.490]  I don't think there's a limit on the Koozlers.
[09:21.490 --> 09:25.790]  So you can buy out all the Koozlers and no one has wet little hands.
[09:25.870 --> 09:27.930]  Would you say you're a disappointment to your family?
[09:28.190 --> 09:28.510]  No.
[09:28.830 --> 09:29.230]  Oh, okay.
[09:29.330 --> 09:30.070]  I don't think so at all.
[09:30.330 --> 09:31.450]  You just spent time with your family.
[09:31.530 --> 09:33.150]  Yeah, I spent a lot of time with my family.
[09:33.530 --> 09:36.010]  Yeah, your aunt and uncle are big fans of break shows.
[09:36.130 --> 09:36.570]  Speaking of...
[09:37.150 --> 09:37.490]  Oh, yeah.
[09:37.810 --> 09:38.410]  Right here.
[09:39.030 --> 09:39.750]  My uncle...
[09:39.750 --> 09:40.090]  One minute.
[09:40.170 --> 09:45.150]  ...who was here last time, watched from the back, said, hey, are these Ultraman cards?
[09:45.610 --> 09:47.090]  Would those work on your show?
[09:47.210 --> 09:48.050]  And I said, absolutely.
[09:48.230 --> 09:49.050]  So he sent them out.
[09:49.370 --> 09:50.570]  We have two packs of Ultraman cards.
[09:50.570 --> 09:54.930]  My uncle is a pre-viz animator.
[09:55.110 --> 09:59.050]  So he worked on Spider-Man, the first Spider-Verse movie.
[09:59.210 --> 09:59.490]  Oh, yeah.
[09:59.630 --> 10:00.050]  That one.
[10:00.370 --> 10:02.550]  He's worked on Anastasia and Balto and The Mask.
[10:02.870 --> 10:03.250]  Dude, Balto.
[10:03.250 --> 10:04.210]  The Power Rangers movie.
[10:04.270 --> 10:04.490]  Wow.
[10:04.490 --> 10:04.790]  Balto.
[10:05.290 --> 10:06.290]  The animated mask?
[10:06.410 --> 10:06.490]  We're live.
[10:06.910 --> 10:07.750]  No, no, no, like the...
[10:07.750 --> 10:08.250]  Oh, they're live.
[10:08.530 --> 10:09.350]  Oh, my God, they're live.
[10:09.550 --> 10:10.310]  Throw up a lower third.
[10:10.590 --> 10:11.950]  Store.roosterteeth.com.
[10:12.050 --> 10:12.350]  Go now.
[10:12.510 --> 10:12.730]  Go now.
[10:13.510 --> 10:16.670]  I think what we should do, let's open up one of these Ultraman packs and put the other
[10:16.670 --> 10:17.330]  one in the pack sack.
[10:17.330 --> 10:17.590]  I love them.
[10:17.750 --> 10:18.530]  Right, here we go.
[10:18.530 --> 10:19.270]  I like this one.
[10:19.470 --> 10:20.090]  Speak it to me.
[10:20.710 --> 10:21.890]  We'll see you later someday.
[10:22.110 --> 10:23.470]  He works at Netflix right now.
[10:23.850 --> 10:25.790]  He was at Sony, now he's at Netflix.
[10:26.030 --> 10:28.230]  Is he the one in charge of the password sharing going away?
[10:28.870 --> 10:29.230]  Thanks.
[10:29.550 --> 10:32.830]  Yeah, as a pre-viz animator, he's in charge of the password sharing.
[10:32.830 --> 10:34.450]  Why would they give him that decision?
[10:34.550 --> 10:35.030]  I don't know.
[10:35.150 --> 10:36.510]  Especially as a pre-viz animator.
[10:36.570 --> 10:36.790]  Yeah.
[10:36.930 --> 10:37.610]  Doesn't make any sense.
[10:37.690 --> 10:39.330]  Guys, store.roosterteeth.com right now.
[10:39.390 --> 10:41.510]  Scan that QR code, even though you're already watching on your phone.
[10:41.730 --> 10:45.670]  If you win the USB, ask your dad to borrow his laptop so you can plug it in and see what
[10:45.670 --> 10:45.950]  the video is.
[10:45.950 --> 10:46.950]  Dad, I want your laptop.
[10:46.950 --> 10:48.030]  Here we go, Ultraman.
[10:48.350 --> 10:49.230]  Ultraman, here we go.
[10:49.530 --> 10:52.050]  This is original artwork by Michael Mastermaker.
[10:52.870 --> 10:54.630]  That's that guy's name, Michael Mastermaker.
[10:54.870 --> 10:55.410]  That's pretty cool.
[10:55.530 --> 10:56.830]  That's a picture of Ultraman.
[10:57.050 --> 10:58.010]  Whoa, that's sick.
[10:58.170 --> 10:58.790]  That's Ultraman.
[10:59.290 --> 10:59.730]  Wow.
[11:00.010 --> 11:01.350]  Here is the rainbow.
[11:01.450 --> 11:04.130]  You remember this from the Rainbow's Egg episode of Ultraman.
[11:04.530 --> 11:04.850]  Oh, there he is.
[11:04.850 --> 11:06.050]  That's Ultraman as a dinosaur.
[11:06.270 --> 11:06.910]  There he is.
[11:07.110 --> 11:08.770]  There's Garanominon.
[11:09.550 --> 11:12.490]  That was Ultraman with one of those weird beards.
[11:13.850 --> 11:14.730]  Here's Gorgos.
[11:15.610 --> 11:16.050]  Wow.
[11:16.050 --> 11:17.130]  He's looking good.
[11:17.170 --> 11:19.190]  That's really what it is.
[11:19.430 --> 11:21.390]  Here's Goldon.
[11:21.930 --> 11:25.190]  Now, question, has this existed for a while?
[11:25.410 --> 11:25.790]  What do you mean?
[11:25.890 --> 11:27.030]  I've never heard of Ultraman.
[11:27.430 --> 11:29.190]  It's been around since the 60s Japanese.
[11:29.630 --> 11:30.690]  Oh, okay, 60s Japanese.
[11:30.690 --> 11:31.890]  Alien Zareb.
[11:32.030 --> 11:32.190]  Yeah.
[11:32.570 --> 11:33.630]  He's old.
[11:33.870 --> 11:34.470]  I don't know about you.
[11:34.490 --> 11:38.870]  I used to watch Ultraman on Sunday mornings on USA when I was like nine.
[11:39.110 --> 11:39.410]  Okay.
[11:40.250 --> 11:40.730]  Pigmon.
[11:40.910 --> 11:41.130]  Oh, that's me.
[11:41.130 --> 11:41.750]  That's my favorite.
[11:41.890 --> 11:42.710]  Yeah, he's pretty cool.
[11:42.710 --> 11:43.490]  Can you sleep?
[11:44.930 --> 11:45.670]  What's sold out?
[11:45.670 --> 11:46.830]  All of your Gerplers.
[11:46.950 --> 11:48.570]  The Gerplers are sold out?
[11:49.170 --> 11:50.830]  The Gerplers are sold out.
[11:50.830 --> 11:51.510]  About 200.
[11:52.170 --> 11:53.130]  Wait, what happened?
[11:53.450 --> 11:54.830]  We are sold out of Gerplers.
[11:56.130 --> 11:58.350]  100% sold out of Gerplers.
[11:58.510 --> 11:59.610]  There are no more Gerplers.
[11:59.890 --> 12:00.570]  You can go home.
[12:01.890 --> 12:02.710]  So we're done?
[12:03.870 --> 12:05.270]  Thanks for tuning in to the Koozlers stream.
[12:05.270 --> 12:07.690]  Check out these card sleeves.
[12:07.910 --> 12:08.910]  There's a new shirt.
[12:09.270 --> 12:11.670]  A lot of Gerplers hit the market recently.
[12:11.850 --> 12:13.810]  We've heard there's a need for Koozlers.
[12:13.810 --> 12:17.550]  You might want to get a dry hand when they drink out of their Gerpler.
[12:17.790 --> 12:19.950]  That's why we started this live stream.
[12:20.230 --> 12:22.090]  This is the Koozler live stream.
[12:22.210 --> 12:23.170]  The Koozler Break Show.
[12:24.250 --> 12:26.490]  You can buy as many of these as you want.
[12:26.750 --> 12:28.210]  They make great stocking stuffers.
[12:28.470 --> 12:30.130]  They're useless unless you own a Gerpler.
[12:30.270 --> 12:30.390]  Yep.
[12:31.250 --> 12:33.770]  I'm going to check Twitter to see if anyone tweeted at me so I can block them real quick.
[12:33.930 --> 12:35.090]  Alien Baltan.
[12:35.170 --> 12:36.090]  Oh yeah, baby!
[12:36.930 --> 12:37.330]  Doraco.
[12:39.530 --> 12:40.330]  Alien Methylos.
[12:40.630 --> 12:41.030]  Methylos?
[12:41.030 --> 12:44.030]  And last but not least, oh my God.
[12:44.210 --> 12:44.970]  Here he is again.
[12:45.090 --> 12:45.730]  Everybody's favorite.
[12:45.950 --> 12:46.390]  Pigmon!
[12:46.690 --> 12:47.050]  Whoa!
[12:47.670 --> 12:50.470]  That must be his parallel.
[12:50.870 --> 12:52.230]  This is me getting my nails done.
[12:54.050 --> 13:01.710]  Pigmon looks like a character that you would see tattooed on a guy at a death metal show.
[13:01.790 --> 13:03.290]  Yeah, like a doom metal show.
[13:03.370 --> 13:06.570]  He would have a huge Pigmon tattoo on his shin.
[13:07.050 --> 13:08.410]  And you'd be like, what the fuck is that?
[13:08.430 --> 13:09.170]  And he goes, Pigmon.
[13:09.230 --> 13:09.530]  Pigmon.
[13:09.530 --> 13:10.430]  And you go, oh.
[13:10.450 --> 13:10.990]  Oh, okay.
[13:11.190 --> 13:11.370]  Yeah.
[13:12.290 --> 13:12.570]  Great.
[13:12.890 --> 13:14.190]  It's next to his highest tattoo.
[13:14.970 --> 13:15.330]  Hell yeah.
[13:17.350 --> 13:19.770]  At RTX this year, we're going to be doing a live break show.
[13:19.970 --> 13:20.450]  Oh, we are?
[13:20.530 --> 13:21.170]  Yeah, me and you.
[13:21.270 --> 13:21.550]  Okay.
[13:21.950 --> 13:22.930]  Emily, you can come too if you want to.
[13:23.190 --> 13:24.890]  But you might be, I don't know, it's up to you.
[13:24.910 --> 13:25.310]  She'll be there.
[13:25.390 --> 13:25.730]  I'll be there.
[13:25.850 --> 13:26.330]  Okay, cool.
[13:26.510 --> 13:28.450]  Well, then I'll have to get another microphone.
[13:28.450 --> 13:29.110]  Dude, we look good.
[13:29.350 --> 13:30.050]  Sarah or whatever.
[13:30.070 --> 13:30.490]  Look at us.
[13:31.330 --> 13:32.910]  You look like a man.
[13:33.430 --> 13:33.710]  Thanks.
[13:33.890 --> 13:35.170]  You've got man vibes.
[13:35.270 --> 13:35.630]  Appreciate it.
[13:35.630 --> 13:36.510]  Solid stepdad.
[13:36.630 --> 13:37.230]  Yeah, thank you.
[13:37.450 --> 13:37.730]  Solid.
[13:37.730 --> 13:38.310]  Big time.
[13:38.650 --> 13:40.890]  I'm not the stepdad.
[13:40.990 --> 13:42.570]  I'm the dad who likes to get stepped on.
[13:43.630 --> 13:48.890]  And I was definitely the dad who stepped up in a soft and understanding way.
[13:49.130 --> 13:53.250]  So, we're going to be doing that live at RTX, but we're also, we just worked out with Wes,
[13:53.590 --> 13:56.230]  who's helping with so much of this RTX stuff.
[13:56.350 --> 13:56.450]  Yeah.
[13:56.550 --> 13:57.690]  Really undertaking a lot of it.
[13:58.130 --> 14:03.310]  He's like, hey, what if we made baseball cards for Geoff and Eric that are fuck face and we'll
[14:03.310 --> 14:06.810]  give those out at the break show and then maybe around at RTX.
[14:06.810 --> 14:08.290]  So, we're going to have those there.
[14:08.770 --> 14:13.270]  So, you have to come to RTX to get this exclusive baseball card that we've never printed before,
[14:13.670 --> 14:14.830]  but that'll be exciting.
[14:15.090 --> 14:16.670]  I was not listening to anything you said.
[14:16.910 --> 14:17.350]  Wow.
[14:17.350 --> 14:18.090]  I zoned out.
[14:18.150 --> 14:18.450]  Wow.
[14:18.450 --> 14:19.550]  I completely zoned out.
[14:19.590 --> 14:19.810]  Whatever.
[14:21.150 --> 14:22.350]  Hopefully the audience was.
[14:22.570 --> 14:22.990]  Great.
[14:23.270 --> 14:24.190]  I was listening.
[14:24.330 --> 14:25.090]  I was listening.
[14:25.930 --> 14:26.770]  I was listening.
[14:26.770 --> 14:27.570]  Let me see that little thing.
[14:27.730 --> 14:28.530]  Totally saw that.
[14:29.130 --> 14:29.210]  Wow.
[14:29.750 --> 14:30.410]  Just a second.
[14:31.050 --> 14:32.470]  No, that NASA thing.
[14:32.830 --> 14:33.150]  The what?
[14:33.290 --> 14:33.590]  NASA?
[14:33.710 --> 14:33.830]  Yeah.
[14:34.750 --> 14:35.370]  The basketball thing?
[14:35.370 --> 14:35.650]  Yeah.
[14:35.730 --> 14:37.710]  Can you let them know that we're saying more?
[14:38.830 --> 14:39.510]  That needs to be cool.
[14:40.790 --> 14:41.230]  Oh, yeah.
[14:41.330 --> 14:41.770]  That's you.
[14:41.990 --> 14:43.170]  I'm like Alf and...
[14:43.170 --> 14:45.250]  You're like Alf with getting the sun tan.
[14:45.290 --> 14:45.750]  And Pigmon.
[14:45.950 --> 14:46.530]  And Pigmon.
[14:46.970 --> 14:48.710]  You're like a cross between Alf and Pigmon.
[14:48.790 --> 14:49.510]  That sounds right.
[14:50.050 --> 14:50.610]  Hey, Eric.
[14:50.890 --> 14:51.630]  Welcome back, buddy.
[14:51.750 --> 14:52.150]  Yeah, no problem.
[14:52.310 --> 14:53.730]  I want to open up something special for Eric.
[14:54.070 --> 14:55.750]  I got this one pack of cards.
[14:55.810 --> 14:55.930]  Okay.
[14:56.530 --> 14:57.390]  I got these on eBay.
[14:57.510 --> 14:58.610]  I don't even remember who told me about them.
[14:58.650 --> 14:59.330]  It could have been my mom.
[14:59.390 --> 14:59.930]  It could have been you.
[15:00.010 --> 15:00.550]  It could have been you.
[15:00.670 --> 15:01.430]  Somebody told me about them.
[15:02.110 --> 15:03.050]  And so, I went and bought them.
[15:03.610 --> 15:04.390]  Hayley told you about them.
[15:04.390 --> 15:05.970]  My friend Hayley told me about them.
[15:07.110 --> 15:07.510]  AIDS.
[15:08.130 --> 15:08.250]  What?
[15:08.630 --> 15:08.790]  Fight it.
[15:08.990 --> 15:09.590]  Stop it.
[15:09.690 --> 15:11.730]  These are AIDS awareness cards.
[15:11.810 --> 15:13.130]  There's no AIDS in this card.
[15:13.530 --> 15:16.490]  These cards exist to raise awareness for AIDS.
[15:17.030 --> 15:19.850]  I have no idea what would be in a pack of AIDS awareness cards.
[15:19.930 --> 15:21.510]  But I paid like six bucks to find out.
[15:21.730 --> 15:23.510]  And I bought them months ago.
[15:23.590 --> 15:23.970]  I've been waiting.
[15:24.690 --> 15:26.570]  Man, this break show has taught me patience.
[15:27.270 --> 15:27.770]  Wow, man.
[15:27.770 --> 15:29.450]  It has taught me extreme patience.
[15:29.890 --> 15:30.110]  Yep.
[15:30.710 --> 15:31.830]  Let's see what we get in here.
[15:31.950 --> 15:33.170]  Oh, well, first off...
[15:34.070 --> 15:34.770]  Loving that.
[15:34.870 --> 15:35.070]  Okay.
[15:36.570 --> 15:37.610]  Matilda Krim.
[15:37.850 --> 15:41.170]  She was a biologist and co-founder of Amphar.
[15:41.310 --> 15:42.210]  Do you think we'll get a Fauci?
[15:42.970 --> 15:43.230]  Whoa!
[15:43.230 --> 15:44.810]  We absolutely could get a Fauci.
[15:44.850 --> 15:45.610]  Fauci Parallel?
[15:45.650 --> 15:47.810]  Here's a bunch of acronyms.
[15:48.270 --> 15:51.990]  G-M-H-C-A-P-L-A-S-F-A-F.
[15:52.130 --> 15:52.370]  Okay.
[15:52.490 --> 15:53.950]  Here's Michael Callen.
[15:54.050 --> 15:54.890]  He's a songwriter.
[15:55.890 --> 15:57.670]  He talked about AIDS, I think.
[15:58.110 --> 15:59.110]  Rudy Gimrick.
[15:59.290 --> 16:01.670]  He is a fashion designer and a gay activist.
[16:02.290 --> 16:04.890]  Barry Lane and Robert Jacobson.
[16:05.290 --> 16:07.130]  They are journalists.
[16:07.550 --> 16:08.270]  Ooh, here we have...
[16:08.270 --> 16:09.210]  That's a lovely photo.
[16:09.910 --> 16:11.850]  Picture of baritone William Parker.
[16:12.330 --> 16:12.910]  Baritone?
[16:12.910 --> 16:13.650]  That's what it says.
[16:13.690 --> 16:14.090]  He's a baritone.
[16:14.570 --> 16:18.170]  Vito Russo is a film historian and activist.
[16:19.390 --> 16:22.470]  What is AIDS and what causes it?
[16:22.550 --> 16:24.110]  There's a card on the back.
[16:24.190 --> 16:27.110]  It'll tell you everything you need to know about AIDS.
[16:28.550 --> 16:29.750]  Here's about...
[16:29.750 --> 16:31.710]  Here's a good word of the wise.
[16:31.810 --> 16:33.050]  Stop blood transmissions.
[16:33.310 --> 16:34.190]  That's an important one.
[16:35.030 --> 16:37.210]  This card covers AIDS in Africa.
[16:37.350 --> 16:37.930]  Huge epidemic.
[16:38.330 --> 16:41.470]  You know, actually, who did a lot for AIDS in Africa was George Bush.
[16:41.810 --> 16:42.910]  A lot of people don't like to give him credit.
[16:43.590 --> 16:43.910]  Really?
[16:44.070 --> 16:44.890]  Political issues, but yeah.
[16:45.030 --> 16:45.670]  I wasn't aware of that.
[16:45.690 --> 16:46.150]  He did a lot.
[16:46.210 --> 16:47.050]  He did a lot for AIDS in Africa.
[16:47.290 --> 16:48.110]  You gotta give him credit for that.
[16:48.410 --> 16:50.390]  IV drug users and AIDS.
[16:50.530 --> 16:51.210]  Oh, that's...
[16:51.210 --> 16:51.610]  There's Eric.
[16:52.710 --> 16:53.530]  There's Eric right there.
[16:54.570 --> 16:54.930]  What?
[16:55.250 --> 16:56.670]  IV drug users...
[16:56.670 --> 16:57.470]  With AIDS?
[16:58.490 --> 16:58.970]  Yeah.
[16:59.470 --> 17:03.310]  And then, last but not least, theater and film director Tony Richardson.
[17:03.550 --> 17:05.870]  And every pack comes with a free condom.
[17:05.910 --> 17:06.210]  Oh!
[17:06.710 --> 17:07.950]  Any expiration on that?
[17:08.830 --> 17:09.310]  Yes.
[17:10.170 --> 17:10.650]  1992.
[17:11.390 --> 17:12.470]  June of 1992.
[17:13.450 --> 17:14.050]  Just missed it.
[17:14.670 --> 17:15.150]  Wow.
[17:15.410 --> 17:16.110]  Oh my God.
[17:16.170 --> 17:17.390]  That's an old condom.
[17:18.910 --> 17:26.090]  Before we get to the next pack, I'm in the process of working with the merch team right now to double our order and get them reordered ASAP.
[17:26.210 --> 17:26.930]  Are you fucking serious?
[17:26.930 --> 17:28.390]  For purple and green.
[17:28.870 --> 17:29.470]  So, I'm working on that right now.
[17:29.470 --> 17:30.630]  No more golden Gerplers, though.
[17:30.850 --> 17:31.330]  That's out.
[17:31.370 --> 17:34.570]  The gold we did for this, we can do something like that going forward another time.
[17:34.810 --> 17:37.310]  I'm just trying to get you guys Gerplers as fast as we can going forward.
[17:38.530 --> 17:39.330]  Just FYI.
[17:39.430 --> 17:40.630]  But, I do want to...
[17:40.630 --> 17:41.450]  Just camera on Geoff.
[17:41.610 --> 17:44.730]  I do want to say, this has worked really well.
[17:45.170 --> 17:46.610]  The Koozler is great.
[17:46.890 --> 17:49.430]  I will acquiesce and say this was a great idea.
[17:49.770 --> 17:50.450]  This was great.
[17:50.550 --> 17:51.430]  Camera back on Geoff.
[17:52.190 --> 17:56.190]  And I just want to know, since people are asking, thoughts on Marcus Smart?
[17:56.990 --> 17:58.330]  We did...
[17:58.330 --> 18:04.870]  This can be your first public forum to talk about what happened.
[18:04.910 --> 18:08.350]  I was going to wear a Marcus Smart jersey in solidarity.
[18:09.330 --> 18:11.530]  With who? Marcus Smart? He doesn't play there anymore.
[18:11.570 --> 18:16.450]  In solidarity with all Celtics fans who love heart and dedication and grit and grind.
[18:16.850 --> 18:21.950]  And supporting a player who has given his all to your organization.
[18:22.630 --> 18:25.230]  But, we have to immediately leave here to go meet with the wedding planner.
[18:25.230 --> 18:26.050]  And I...
[18:26.050 --> 18:29.670]  It just seemed like an odd look to meet with the wedding planner at the venue.
[18:30.110 --> 18:34.270]  And be like, you know, walking around a 48 year old dude in a fucking basketball jersey.
[18:34.930 --> 18:35.950]  You can change shirts.
[18:36.090 --> 18:37.350]  It's 115 degrees outside.
[18:37.570 --> 18:38.310]  I like the Celtics.
[18:38.830 --> 18:41.870]  Hi, hi, I like sports. I'm in sports.
[18:42.750 --> 18:49.090]  I was listening to Bill Simmons last night and there was a conversation about how the age are too old to wear jerseys anymore.
[18:49.210 --> 18:50.650]  And they put the cut off at like 30.
[18:51.190 --> 18:51.850]  Oh, fuck.
[18:52.530 --> 18:54.110]  I have like 18 jerseys.
[18:54.110 --> 18:56.070]  I'm heartbroken. I'm heartbroken.
[18:56.510 --> 18:58.190]  Marcus Smart is...
[18:58.190 --> 19:01.270]  Well, first off, and I had to explain this to Emily a little bit last night.
[19:01.610 --> 19:02.070]  Slowly.
[19:02.170 --> 19:04.330]  I am a lifelong Boston Celtics fan.
[19:04.390 --> 19:05.070]  Completely understand.
[19:05.270 --> 19:09.210]  I have been a Boston Celtics fan since 1986 when I was 11 years old.
[19:09.330 --> 19:10.050]  That's when I discovered you.
[19:10.050 --> 19:10.650]  That's when I was born.
[19:10.890 --> 19:11.350]  Thank you.
[19:11.990 --> 19:13.290]  That's when I discovered you.
[19:13.710 --> 19:17.910]  So, I will always be a Boston Celtics fan.
[19:17.970 --> 19:18.490]  I totally understand.
[19:18.490 --> 19:22.550]  My love for the organization is greater than any individual player.
[19:22.570 --> 19:23.570]  I completely understand.
[19:23.570 --> 19:32.770]  It doesn't sully or damage my feelings towards the Celtics or Brad Stevens, the president of operations, in any way whatsoever.
[19:33.110 --> 19:38.290]  It breaks my heart that my favorite player in the world will not be playing for my favorite team in the world.
[19:38.370 --> 19:49.530]  However, if I can take a dispassionate look, if I can take a step back, take a 10,000 foot view and take a motion completely out of it, I understand the trade.
[19:49.830 --> 19:51.310]  It doesn't make it any easier to take.
[19:51.510 --> 19:52.930]  I still wish they hadn't done it.
[19:52.930 --> 19:56.390]  But I understand why they did it.
[19:56.550 --> 19:59.290]  And ultimately, going forward, it may be what's best for basketball.
[19:59.570 --> 20:05.710]  The way I'm choosing to look at it is that instead of losing Marcus Smart on the Celtics, the Grizzlies gained a fan.
[20:05.870 --> 20:06.050]  Yeah.
[20:06.170 --> 20:08.250]  Because now I have to follow the Grizzlies and the Celtics.
[20:08.430 --> 20:15.730]  And I will follow the Grizzlies until Marcus Smart leaves there to go back to the Celtics, which is where he belongs and where he will end up again someday in his career.
[20:15.890 --> 20:18.270]  You think he'll have like a little tour at the end?
[20:18.290 --> 20:19.190]  He'll do like the Paul Pierce.
[20:19.190 --> 20:20.270]  I think it's great.
[20:20.290 --> 20:21.630]  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[20:21.630 --> 20:25.190]  He's going to go down as one of the great, not one of the greatest basketball players, obviously.
[20:25.870 --> 20:35.630]  Not even one of the greatest basketball players in the organization, but one of the greatest Celtics players of all time in terms of culture and fit and art and love for the city and the team and the organization.
[20:35.990 --> 20:38.530]  And so he will end up being a Celtic. He will retire a Celtic.
[20:38.730 --> 20:40.350]  They will hang his number from the rafters.
[20:40.570 --> 20:41.450]  I have no doubt.
[20:41.550 --> 20:46.610]  Are you excited to watch Winning Time Season 2 where the Celtics are portrayed as evil villains the whole time again?
[20:46.770 --> 20:48.590]  I'll skip that one just like I skipped Season 1.
[20:48.650 --> 20:50.630]  Come on! It's great. It's so cool.
[20:50.630 --> 20:52.850]  Yeah, it's great.
[20:52.970 --> 20:57.270]  It's truly they are the villain organization the whole time and the big rallying cry.
[20:58.230 --> 20:58.870]  Fuck Boston.
[21:01.210 --> 21:01.830]  There you go.
[21:01.950 --> 21:02.570]  It's great.
[21:02.810 --> 21:03.650]  Hey, let's open some more cards.
[21:04.090 --> 21:05.330]  I got something special I want to open up.
[21:05.410 --> 21:06.150]  I'm very excited about this.
[21:06.210 --> 21:10.610]  I just bought this box of Topps Chrome Tennis because I know how much Eric loves tennis.
[21:11.690 --> 21:12.910]  2021. It's the most recent year.
[21:13.230 --> 21:14.310]  These also just came out.
[21:14.550 --> 21:16.350]  I was like, why do you guys have 2021 tennis?
[21:16.470 --> 21:17.270]  And he's like, that's a great question.
[21:17.350 --> 21:18.150]  It just came out.
[21:18.210 --> 21:18.610]  We don't know.
[21:20.770 --> 21:22.410]  I guess it took a long time to come out.
[21:22.490 --> 21:27.930]  I don't know what's in here, but I'm going to assume get like some some Williams sisters autos or something.
[21:27.950 --> 21:28.810]  Bad girl.
[21:29.690 --> 21:31.070]  I don't know anybody's name.
[21:31.390 --> 21:31.710]  Nadal?
[21:32.190 --> 21:32.590]  Not right?
[21:32.630 --> 21:33.090]  That's a boy.
[21:33.970 --> 21:34.770]  Rafael Nadal.
[21:35.070 --> 21:36.950]  Who do you have his racket?
[21:37.130 --> 21:37.450]  Nadal.
[21:37.650 --> 21:38.850]  You have a Nadal racket?
[21:39.110 --> 21:40.150]  Well, I have a same brand.
[21:40.530 --> 21:40.930]  Babalat.
[21:41.350 --> 21:41.550]  Man.
[21:41.790 --> 21:42.030]  Whoa.
[21:42.190 --> 21:43.150]  I'm like, whoa, that's crazy.
[21:44.150 --> 21:45.950]  Put one of these bad boys in the pack sack.
[21:47.950 --> 21:49.850]  So we're making more Gertlers.
[21:50.010 --> 21:50.690]  Working on it.
[21:50.710 --> 21:52.890]  So I'm in the middle of having the conversation right now.
[21:54.010 --> 21:55.330]  So we just sold a thousand.
[21:56.550 --> 21:57.550]  Well, how many we make next time?
[21:57.590 --> 21:57.910]  2000?
[21:58.110 --> 21:59.070]  Yeah, I asked for a double.
[21:59.390 --> 22:01.470]  OK, so we'll make so 2000 Gertlers coming.
[22:01.750 --> 22:01.890]  Yeah.
[22:03.230 --> 22:04.650]  As soon as we can get them out to you.
[22:04.670 --> 22:04.810]  Yep.
[22:05.110 --> 22:06.830]  I don't think we'll probably do a live stream for that one.
[22:06.890 --> 22:07.370]  That'll be.
[22:07.670 --> 22:08.990]  We'll let you know when they go on sale.
[22:09.050 --> 22:13.170]  Hit the notify me email thing on the page and we'll let you know.
[22:13.490 --> 22:14.970]  It'll probably be blind box again.
[22:15.090 --> 22:15.930]  I don't think we'll do gold.
[22:15.930 --> 22:17.090]  I'm sure it'll just be.
[22:17.590 --> 22:20.310]  I just want to keep them in stock.
[22:20.470 --> 22:21.150]  Yeah, of course.
[22:21.210 --> 22:22.450]  I want to keep the Gertlers in stock.
[22:22.970 --> 22:23.090]  So.
[22:23.610 --> 22:24.370]  Ken Rosewall.
[22:24.570 --> 22:24.830]  Uh-huh.
[22:25.150 --> 22:25.670]  There's a.
[22:25.870 --> 22:26.230]  There you go.
[22:26.690 --> 22:28.930]  How about Mark Woodford?
[22:29.330 --> 22:29.730]  Woodford.
[22:30.730 --> 22:32.070]  Oh, here's a gold.
[22:32.630 --> 22:35.930]  There's a gold parallel of Daniela Hantechova.
[22:37.090 --> 22:37.390]  OK.
[22:37.750 --> 22:38.290]  That's nice.
[22:38.450 --> 22:40.590]  You love picking cards where you can't pronounce.
[22:40.690 --> 22:41.450]  Yes, I do.
[22:41.710 --> 22:43.770]  Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.
[22:44.170 --> 22:45.070]  Fucking nailed that one.
[22:45.070 --> 22:45.850]  They're all mirrored.
[22:46.230 --> 22:46.990]  Yeah, they're chrome.
[22:47.310 --> 22:48.230]  Oh, OK.
[22:48.910 --> 22:50.430]  I'm here to ask the dumb questions.
[22:50.430 --> 22:50.990]  No, no, no.
[22:50.990 --> 22:51.570]  This is good.
[22:51.730 --> 22:52.270]  You're the everyman.
[22:52.310 --> 22:53.610]  People have to know.
[22:54.010 --> 22:54.790]  People has to know.
[22:55.430 --> 22:56.470]  Misaki Doi.
[22:57.250 --> 22:57.870]  Mm-hmm.
[22:58.090 --> 22:59.270]  Conchita Martinez.
[23:00.270 --> 23:00.530]  Yay.
[23:01.050 --> 23:01.490]  Hooray.
[23:02.990 --> 23:04.070]  Oh, I got sounds.
[23:04.210 --> 23:04.530]  Yay.
[23:04.930 --> 23:05.930]  OK, that's probably not the right sound.
[23:07.750 --> 23:08.270]  Yeah.
[23:09.830 --> 23:10.870]  Johnny Newcomb.
[23:11.330 --> 23:11.790]  Whoa.
[23:12.530 --> 23:13.990]  That's old timey.
[23:13.990 --> 23:14.310]  Fuck.
[23:14.510 --> 23:15.650]  No, that's the wrong one, too.
[23:17.130 --> 23:18.310]  This guy's awesome.
[23:19.070 --> 23:20.050]  We should probably...
[23:20.050 --> 23:20.650]  He's got flair.
[23:20.870 --> 23:22.270]  Can we flair-sleeve that guy?
[23:22.630 --> 23:23.270]  Oh, and we should...
[23:23.670 --> 23:24.790]  She's a wholesome happy.
[23:24.910 --> 23:25.570]  We should sleeve that.
[23:26.010 --> 23:27.990]  And then we have Carrie Melville Reid.
[23:28.630 --> 23:29.770]  It's not just current tennis players.
[23:29.910 --> 23:30.950]  It's apparently old ones as well.
[23:31.070 --> 23:33.370]  Did you not tell that by the rest of the cards?
[23:33.730 --> 23:35.090]  Yeah, I was just catching the audience up.
[23:35.490 --> 23:36.450]  Let's open up a few more packs.
[23:37.890 --> 23:39.790]  I want to get some current hotties.
[23:40.450 --> 23:41.050]  I want to get some...
[23:41.050 --> 23:41.770]  I want to get a...
[23:41.770 --> 23:43.210]  I want to get a...
[23:43.730 --> 23:44.170]  Andy...
[23:44.870 --> 23:45.310]  Manos.
[23:45.570 --> 23:45.710]  What?
[23:45.990 --> 23:46.530]  Andy Reid.
[23:46.910 --> 23:47.090]  Huh?
[23:47.250 --> 23:47.630]  Andy Manos.
[23:47.890 --> 23:48.350]  Andy Roddick?
[23:48.610 --> 23:49.250]  Is that his name?
[23:49.350 --> 23:50.110]  No, Andy Manos.
[23:50.270 --> 23:51.110]  Whatever that is.
[23:51.510 --> 23:52.790]  Andy Manos is somebody I knew in the Army.
[23:55.170 --> 23:55.990]  Rajiv Ram.
[23:58.710 --> 23:59.150]  Oh...
[23:59.150 --> 24:00.270]  Oh, we got a parallel.
[24:00.550 --> 24:01.770]  Oh, it's a Hall of Famer.
[24:02.950 --> 24:03.390]  Oh...
[24:03.390 --> 24:05.290]  It's Pete Sampras' Aces card.
[24:05.310 --> 24:05.390]  Oh, boy.
[24:05.550 --> 24:06.970]  Oh, it's silver.
[24:07.150 --> 24:08.010]  Pete Sampras.
[24:08.170 --> 24:08.610]  Aces.
[24:08.750 --> 24:09.610]  We sleeve that, at least.
[24:11.130 --> 24:12.230]  Juan Ignacio Londero.
[24:13.450 --> 24:13.890]  Ooh.
[24:14.290 --> 24:14.730]  Yeah.
[24:14.730 --> 24:15.010]  Ooh.
[24:15.170 --> 24:15.730]  That's a nice one.
[24:16.390 --> 24:18.270]  And we'll open up one more pack of these fuckers.
[24:20.230 --> 24:20.670]  Aces.
[24:20.850 --> 24:22.270]  I wish I had a trash can or something.
[24:22.750 --> 24:23.250]  But I don't.
[24:24.650 --> 24:25.090]  Uh...
[24:25.090 --> 24:26.570]  Butch Buchholz.
[24:27.830 --> 24:28.270]  Uh...
[24:29.450 --> 24:30.330]  Sabine Lisicki.
[24:30.510 --> 24:34.490]  Sabine Lisicki has the lisickest thighs I've ever seen.
[24:34.610 --> 24:35.090]  Look at that muscle.
[24:36.010 --> 24:36.450]  Damn.
[24:36.770 --> 24:37.550]  Gotta be fast, man.
[24:37.630 --> 24:38.470]  Play clay courts?
[24:38.750 --> 24:38.870]  Quick.
[24:38.870 --> 24:41.390]  That lady's muscle is jumping off the page.
[24:41.430 --> 24:41.730]  Hell yeah.
[24:41.730 --> 24:43.150]  Madison Keyes.
[24:43.210 --> 24:44.150]  She said, uh...
[24:44.150 --> 24:44.290]  Yeah!
[24:44.570 --> 24:44.930]  Yeah.
[24:46.290 --> 24:46.650]  Yeah.
[24:47.670 --> 24:48.250]  Got it.
[24:49.970 --> 24:50.690]  Alex DeMenoir.
[24:51.910 --> 24:53.630]  They call him the Menoir-tar.
[24:54.130 --> 24:56.150]  Uh-oh.
[24:57.590 --> 24:58.870]  Now we're gonna move along.
[24:58.970 --> 24:59.150]  Yep.
[24:59.270 --> 24:59.850]  We're gonna have some fun.
[24:59.850 --> 25:01.830]  We're gonna open up a couple of country classics.
[25:01.930 --> 25:05.010]  Hey, we just got an overlay, finally, for the shirt that's on sale now.
[25:05.150 --> 25:05.750]  Oh, we got a shirt.
[25:06.050 --> 25:06.610]  Yeah, check it out.
[25:06.670 --> 25:07.250]  This is the shirt.
[25:07.810 --> 25:08.610]  And here it is.
[25:08.730 --> 25:09.590]  And here it comes.
[25:09.630 --> 25:10.430]  And there it goes.
[25:10.430 --> 25:11.210]  And there's the shirt.
[25:11.270 --> 25:12.070]  It is right there.
[25:12.230 --> 25:12.930]  So there...
[25:13.350 --> 25:13.750]  Geoff!
[25:14.110 --> 25:15.430]  Put your arms out like you're wearing it!
[25:16.410 --> 25:16.810]  No!
[25:17.130 --> 25:17.990]  What are you doing?
[25:18.150 --> 25:18.650]  What are you doing?
[25:18.670 --> 25:19.250]  Go bigger!
[25:20.210 --> 25:22.070]  Put it on Geoff!
[25:22.790 --> 25:23.510]  Make it bigger!
[25:23.650 --> 25:24.150]  Put it on Geoff!
[25:27.750 --> 25:28.150]  Nice!
[25:29.350 --> 25:29.750]  Wow!
[25:29.870 --> 25:30.690]  You're wearing it!
[25:30.710 --> 25:31.790]  You're wearing it!
[25:32.210 --> 25:33.050]  That's so cool!
[25:33.070 --> 25:34.250]  You too could look like Geoff.
[25:34.430 --> 25:35.710]  Yeah, if you wanna look like...
[25:35.710 --> 25:38.110]  If you wanna look cool like this, you can buy this shirt.
[25:38.170 --> 25:38.930]  It's the fuckface.
[25:38.930 --> 25:41.930]  It's got the balls, the tiger, it looks so good.
[25:41.970 --> 25:43.310]  Look who's making a surprise appearance.
[25:44.210 --> 25:44.830]  Don Sugar!
[25:46.790 --> 25:47.510]  Hi there.
[25:48.010 --> 25:48.690]  That's amazing!
[25:49.950 --> 25:50.630]  That's great.
[25:50.690 --> 25:51.650]  That was so cool!
[25:51.970 --> 25:53.950]  And then we also have the packs still on sale, just saying.
[25:54.110 --> 25:54.370]  Yeah.
[25:54.570 --> 25:54.750]  Yeah.
[25:54.910 --> 25:56.850]  And there will apparently be more Gerplers in the future.
[25:56.890 --> 25:58.290]  I wonder how long it takes to get Gerplers made.
[25:58.630 --> 25:59.050]  I don't know.
[25:59.490 --> 25:59.550]  Good question.
[25:59.550 --> 26:00.530]  Probably fucking forever.
[26:01.090 --> 26:08.190]  I'm sure it'll take a minute, but hopefully the merch team is watching this and they'll let me know via Slack when we think we'll get them.
[26:08.190 --> 26:09.010]  Roy Acuff.
[26:09.090 --> 26:10.230]  Oh, everybody's heard of this guy.
[26:10.330 --> 26:13.790]  He spawned a kid, and then that kid spawned a kid.
[26:13.950 --> 26:14.110]  What?
[26:14.410 --> 26:14.970]  Hank Williams.
[26:16.670 --> 26:19.290]  He spawned Hank Williams Jr., and then he had Hank III.
[26:19.590 --> 26:20.090]  That's true.
[26:20.150 --> 26:21.710]  Do you like Hank Williams Jr. at all?
[26:21.850 --> 26:21.990]  No.
[26:22.270 --> 26:22.970]  He's terrible.
[26:23.210 --> 26:24.130]  Have you listened to Hank III?
[26:24.570 --> 26:24.770]  Yeah.
[26:24.990 --> 26:25.590]  Fucking great.
[26:25.770 --> 26:26.130]  He's okay.
[26:26.470 --> 26:27.090]  You don't like it?
[26:27.310 --> 26:27.630]  He's alright.
[26:27.770 --> 26:28.850]  You listen to his country stuff?
[26:28.970 --> 26:29.170]  Uh-huh.
[26:29.270 --> 26:30.790]  You listen to his other stuff?
[26:30.870 --> 26:31.070]  Uh-huh.
[26:31.250 --> 26:31.970]  Fucking crazy.
[26:32.510 --> 26:34.350]  Crazy that that's one guy.
[26:34.470 --> 26:35.030]  It's like twins.
[26:35.130 --> 26:35.790]  It skips a generation.
[26:35.790 --> 26:39.410]  I hear weird things about that family.
[26:39.770 --> 26:40.210]  No.
[26:41.230 --> 26:42.110]  Debbie Boone.
[26:42.270 --> 26:43.130]  Oh, nice.
[26:43.590 --> 26:43.710]  Nice.
[26:44.030 --> 26:46.450]  Oh, everybody loves Gene Autry.
[26:46.670 --> 26:46.910]  Alright.
[26:47.110 --> 26:47.330]  Yeah.
[26:47.490 --> 26:49.630]  That's like the quintessential cowboy right there.
[26:50.150 --> 26:50.910]  Roy Acuff again.
[26:51.090 --> 26:51.370]  Wow.
[26:51.390 --> 26:52.010]  He gets two cards.
[26:52.470 --> 26:53.430]  Christy Lane.
[26:54.030 --> 26:56.170]  That's the haircut I was hoping you would get next.
[26:57.570 --> 26:58.090]  That's what I was thinking.
[26:58.530 --> 26:59.170]  You know, this is a very...
[26:59.170 --> 26:59.950]  A haircut like my grandma?
[27:00.170 --> 27:00.430]  Yeah.
[27:00.630 --> 27:04.090]  This is interesting, because it's going to come up...
[27:04.090 --> 27:06.830]  You know, I started my own podcast on the side.
[27:07.390 --> 27:07.870]  Big announce.
[27:07.970 --> 27:09.090]  One of the episodes where...
[27:09.090 --> 27:09.790]  Well, we've talked about it before.
[27:10.090 --> 27:13.390]  One of the episodes where I talk a lot about Dallas comes up.
[27:13.530 --> 27:14.110]  TV show Dallas.
[27:14.310 --> 27:16.430]  So now Emily and I are watching Dallas.
[27:16.470 --> 27:17.170]  Just so you know.
[27:17.510 --> 27:18.110]  And it's all...
[27:18.110 --> 27:18.670]  It looks like that.
[27:18.710 --> 27:20.750]  Just so you know, that's happening a lot on ANMA.
[27:21.170 --> 27:23.790]  Where the last two episodes we've talked about who shot J.R.
[27:23.950 --> 27:27.770]  The new episode that comes out next week starts with talk about who shot J.R.
[27:27.870 --> 27:29.170]  Well, I know who shot J.R.
[27:29.170 --> 27:29.550]  Don't spoil it.
[27:29.570 --> 27:30.490]  I know, because you looked it up!
[27:30.570 --> 27:31.110]  I looked it up.
[27:32.870 --> 27:33.990]  Davis Daniel.
[27:35.310 --> 27:37.410]  That's a young Toby Keith looking guy.
[27:37.550 --> 27:39.170]  This is a lovely image.
[27:39.270 --> 27:39.930]  This is a pretty photo.
[27:40.250 --> 27:40.950]  This is...
[27:40.950 --> 27:42.230]  I've never heard of this person.
[27:42.310 --> 27:43.150]  Michelle Wright.
[27:43.410 --> 27:43.650]  Okay.
[27:45.410 --> 27:46.330]  Here's a checklist.
[27:47.890 --> 27:49.550]  Olivia Newton-John.
[27:49.850 --> 27:50.950]  Rest in peace.
[27:51.090 --> 27:51.530]  R.I.P.
[27:51.790 --> 27:52.510]  Gone too soon.
[27:53.250 --> 27:54.190]  We'll miss you.
[27:57.550 --> 27:59.450]  One more of these country cards.
[28:01.970 --> 28:02.830]  Mark Colley.
[28:03.110 --> 28:03.550]  Nice.
[28:03.870 --> 28:05.010]  God damn.
[28:05.170 --> 28:06.110]  Did Ray Acuff...
[28:07.030 --> 28:07.950]  Dude, what the...
[28:07.950 --> 28:11.330]  Is he the executive producer on this line of cards?
[28:11.490 --> 28:12.390]  Jesus Christ.
[28:12.430 --> 28:12.970]  That's awesome.
[28:13.650 --> 28:16.270]  Hank Williams Jr.'s got a dog and a shotgun.
[28:16.510 --> 28:17.030]  Yeah, bud.
[28:17.290 --> 28:17.950]  He's showing you.
[28:18.110 --> 28:19.330]  He's ready for some football.
[28:21.570 --> 28:22.450]  Doug Kershaw.
[28:22.590 --> 28:22.790]  Yep.
[28:22.850 --> 28:23.950]  He is not ready for football.
[28:23.970 --> 28:25.710]  I'm looking for some George Jones, man.
[28:25.770 --> 28:26.650]  Show me the possum.
[28:26.710 --> 28:27.590]  Gene Autry.
[28:27.670 --> 28:28.990]  Show me the possum.
[28:29.270 --> 28:30.510]  Oh, I'll save that one for last.
[28:30.510 --> 28:31.750]  Clint Black.
[28:32.930 --> 28:34.330]  We're getting into the era there.
[28:35.450 --> 28:36.330]  Danielle Alexander.
[28:36.450 --> 28:37.990]  Looks like she's taking a dump in the woods.
[28:38.990 --> 28:40.170]  Gotta go, gotta go.
[28:40.270 --> 28:40.950]  Copping a squat.
[28:41.270 --> 28:42.210]  Linda Ronstadt.
[28:42.330 --> 28:43.670]  Hanging out with the Hogs.
[28:44.950 --> 28:47.710]  Oh, here we have Raymond Auditorium.
[28:50.410 --> 28:51.290]  Ryman Auditorium.
[28:51.410 --> 28:55.290]  And then last but not least, everybody's favorite, Roy Acuff.
[28:58.110 --> 29:00.210]  Who clearly paid for these cards to be made.
[29:01.170 --> 29:02.430]  What should we open up next?
[29:02.630 --> 29:03.150]  What do you feel?
[29:03.250 --> 29:04.110]  What have you been waiting for?
[29:04.470 --> 29:07.510]  I feel like, Geoff, I feel like every time we do one of these, you're always like,
[29:09.270 --> 29:10.570]  like, oh, I wanted to open this.
[29:10.630 --> 29:11.890]  Oh, I was trying to get to this one.
[29:12.310 --> 29:13.330]  Let's open up a Gilded Age.
[29:13.910 --> 29:15.510]  These cards are so weird.
[29:15.690 --> 29:16.010]  Yeah.
[29:16.310 --> 29:17.450]  These are so weird.
[29:17.710 --> 29:18.330]  Gotta be weird.
[29:18.570 --> 29:18.750]  Yep.
[29:19.710 --> 29:21.710]  We have to open them, though, because I bought them with money.
[29:22.610 --> 29:23.870]  Gotta get a return on that.
[29:24.430 --> 29:25.130]  Here we go.
[29:25.250 --> 29:27.110]  We have Mary Walker.
[29:27.430 --> 29:27.710]  Okay.
[29:28.610 --> 29:29.690]  She was a long time ago.
[29:30.730 --> 29:31.250]  Here's...
[29:31.250 --> 29:32.750]  Are these the same Barrymores?
[29:33.010 --> 29:33.230]  What?
[29:33.710 --> 29:34.130]  Oh.
[29:34.310 --> 29:34.630]  It's...
[29:34.630 --> 29:34.710]  Yeah.
[29:34.890 --> 29:35.270]  Like the theater.
[29:35.270 --> 29:38.250]  Here's the Barrymore family that produced Drew Barrymore.
[29:38.490 --> 29:38.810]  Yes.
[29:38.990 --> 29:40.550]  That's her, like...
[29:40.550 --> 29:40.870]  Sister.
[29:41.210 --> 29:43.670]  Her grandfather was an actor.
[29:43.870 --> 29:44.070]  Yeah.
[29:44.170 --> 29:44.730]  The whole family.
[29:45.410 --> 29:45.630]  The whole family.
[29:45.870 --> 29:46.030]  Yeah.
[29:46.270 --> 29:46.370]  Yeah.
[29:46.870 --> 29:47.990]  Frank Furness.
[29:48.770 --> 29:49.590]  That's where...
[29:49.590 --> 29:50.490]  That's the first Furness.
[29:50.550 --> 29:50.830]  Great.
[29:51.030 --> 29:51.810]  Was invented there.
[29:53.710 --> 29:55.830]  Everybody remembers Bat Masterson.
[29:56.190 --> 29:56.710]  Yeah.
[29:57.830 --> 29:58.970]  Oh, here's a good one.
[29:58.970 --> 30:02.270]  Do you guys remember back in the old days what was dynamite and all?
[30:03.590 --> 30:05.970]  You can use that to blow a stump up in our backyard.
[30:07.010 --> 30:07.470]  That's true.
[30:07.950 --> 30:09.310]  That's what you should do.
[30:09.970 --> 30:11.090]  Get rid of the stump.
[30:11.330 --> 30:12.050]  Edward Bellamy.
[30:12.430 --> 30:13.370]  That's a soup strainer.
[30:13.790 --> 30:14.850]  He looks like Geoff Foxworthy.
[30:15.050 --> 30:16.350]  Looks like a very young Geoff Foxworthy.
[30:17.850 --> 30:19.990]  You might be Geoff Foxworthy!
[30:20.170 --> 30:21.370]  You might be...
[30:22.670 --> 30:23.630]  Edward Bellamy.
[30:25.190 --> 30:26.710]  Foto Valte Cell.
[30:27.110 --> 30:27.710]  Remember that.
[30:27.710 --> 30:28.250]  What?
[30:28.610 --> 30:28.970]  Yeah.
[30:29.950 --> 30:30.310]  What?
[30:30.890 --> 30:31.970]  Foto Valte Cell?
[30:32.130 --> 30:33.170]  Yeah, the Foto Valte Cell.
[30:33.310 --> 30:34.410]  What do you think it is?
[30:35.230 --> 30:35.930]  That's great.
[30:36.330 --> 30:37.450]  It's a solar cell.
[30:38.190 --> 30:38.750]  Nuh-uh.
[30:38.910 --> 30:39.550]  How'd you know that?
[30:39.590 --> 30:40.990]  It's red and it said it was a cell.
[30:41.550 --> 30:42.090]  It's red and yellow.
[30:42.210 --> 30:42.930]  The sun is red and yellow.
[30:43.010 --> 30:43.570]  I also read the back.
[30:43.870 --> 30:44.810]  The Nutcracker.
[30:45.950 --> 30:46.650]  I'm a little shit.
[30:46.770 --> 30:47.370]  I'm a little stinker.
[30:47.890 --> 30:48.670]  Oh, everybody remembers.
[30:48.770 --> 30:49.430]  This is a gold peril.
[30:49.690 --> 30:50.310]  Yeah, there...
[30:50.310 --> 30:52.870]  Do you guys remember back when Chicago got on fire?
[30:53.330 --> 30:54.930]  That night Chicago...
[30:54.930 --> 30:56.050]  That night Chicago died.
[30:56.110 --> 30:57.330]  I heard a...
[30:57.330 --> 30:58.510]  It was a cow.
[30:59.130 --> 31:00.190]  Took the whole city down.
[31:00.190 --> 31:00.550]  It was, yeah.
[31:00.810 --> 31:02.050]  Took the whole fucking city down.
[31:02.070 --> 31:02.550]  One cow.
[31:02.990 --> 31:03.970]  That just goes to show.
[31:04.030 --> 31:04.530]  Good for her.
[31:04.890 --> 31:06.370]  One person can make a difference.
[31:06.790 --> 31:08.210]  Could never be New York.
[31:10.630 --> 31:11.590]  Jane Averill.
[31:12.390 --> 31:13.310]  Parallel of some kind.
[31:13.650 --> 31:14.110]  Oh, a can-can girl.
[31:14.510 --> 31:16.730]  Maybe the Hardeen...
[31:16.730 --> 31:18.950]  It was a French can-can dancer.
[31:19.090 --> 31:19.470]  Nailed it.
[31:19.630 --> 31:25.190]  If you're a journalist, political activist, and wrote the utopian novel Looking Backward,
[31:25.510 --> 31:27.350]  you might be Edward Bellamy.
[31:27.710 --> 31:28.450]  There you go.
[31:28.790 --> 31:29.410]  Let's un-save.
[31:29.550 --> 31:30.330]  Let's just leave it there.
[31:31.370 --> 31:32.510]  Let's do a Zim hunt.
[31:32.650 --> 31:33.210]  Let's go for Zim.
[31:33.210 --> 31:33.310]  Are we Zimming?
[31:33.310 --> 31:34.490]  We got some 1990 tops.
[31:34.490 --> 31:35.890]  We got the Zim right behind you, too.
[31:36.030 --> 31:36.710]  So, like, we know.
[31:36.870 --> 31:37.330]  We got Zim.
[31:37.650 --> 31:38.550]  So, we got that.
[31:38.670 --> 31:39.310]  I mean, I'm just saying.
[31:40.170 --> 31:40.850]  That's what I'm saying.
[31:44.090 --> 31:47.850]  Do you remember earlier when we sold Koozlers?
[31:48.830 --> 31:49.030]  Yeah.
[31:49.310 --> 31:49.950]  And the shirt.
[31:50.050 --> 31:51.390]  Can we put the shirt on Geoff again?
[31:53.410 --> 31:54.430]  Can you just wait like that?
[31:54.490 --> 31:54.590]  Yeah.
[31:59.530 --> 32:00.830]  It's like you guys are wearing the shirt together.
[32:01.170 --> 32:01.490]  Move.
[32:01.690 --> 32:02.310]  And then you got Zim.
[32:03.930 --> 32:05.210]  We have to put it on Zim.
[32:05.470 --> 32:05.630]  Yeah!
[32:06.290 --> 32:06.930]  Put it on Gavin.
[32:07.210 --> 32:07.530]  Awesome.
[32:07.750 --> 32:08.570]  Oh, can you put it on Gavin?
[32:09.250 --> 32:10.530]  Hey, that's what it looks like on him.
[32:10.670 --> 32:12.030]  Can you make him say, oh, on the soundboard?
[32:12.250 --> 32:14.210]  Oh, I've got bows on my shirt.
[32:14.630 --> 32:15.170]  He's at the bottom.
[32:15.830 --> 32:16.150]  Oh.
[32:16.370 --> 32:16.690]  Oh.
[32:17.730 --> 32:18.050]  Oh.
[32:18.430 --> 32:19.010]  Oh, no.
[32:23.290 --> 32:25.370]  I need my board, like, up here or something.
[32:25.590 --> 32:25.850]  All right.
[32:25.850 --> 32:26.690]  Bruce Benedict.
[32:26.850 --> 32:27.470]  Here we go.
[32:27.550 --> 32:28.250]  Zim Huntin'.
[32:28.250 --> 32:29.110]  Bob Kipper.
[32:29.330 --> 32:30.250]  Milt Thompson.
[32:30.610 --> 32:31.290]  Juan Yves.
[32:31.590 --> 32:32.110]  Oh, here we go.
[32:32.170 --> 32:33.330]  Mike Scott All-Star card.
[32:33.410 --> 32:34.990]  Everybody remembers that year Mike Scott was an All-Star.
[32:35.110 --> 32:35.910]  John Franco.
[32:36.610 --> 32:37.870]  Sean Lil Abner.
[32:38.490 --> 32:39.370]  Tim Cruz.
[32:41.550 --> 32:42.850]  Oh, Edgar Martinez.
[32:42.990 --> 32:43.510]  All-Time Great.
[32:44.250 --> 32:45.130]  Dwight Smith.
[32:45.550 --> 32:46.670]  Lance McCullers.
[32:46.830 --> 32:47.710]  Mark Grant.
[32:47.910 --> 32:48.850]  Geoff Bradley.
[32:49.010 --> 32:49.250]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[32:49.790 --> 32:51.350]  We gotta keep the Mark Grant card.
[32:51.770 --> 32:51.990]  Why?
[32:52.110 --> 32:52.270]  Why?
[32:52.330 --> 32:53.370]  That's Mudcat, man.
[32:53.370 --> 32:55.850]  He's the announcer for the Padres now.
[32:55.990 --> 32:57.850]  He was a relief pitcher for, like, so many different teams.
[32:58.370 --> 33:02.250]  He's now the color commentator for the Padres TV booth, and he's awesome.
[33:02.350 --> 33:05.190]  His name's Mudcat, and his nickname is Mudcat.
[33:05.330 --> 33:06.010]  We'll keep Mudcat.
[33:06.010 --> 33:07.510]  I love Mark Grant.
[33:07.850 --> 33:12.630]  Geoff Bradley, Gene Nelson, Scott Scudder, Frank White.
[33:12.770 --> 33:16.890]  We didn't get a Zim, but we did get a Mudcat, which is almost as good.
[33:16.930 --> 33:17.310]  I feel good.
[33:17.670 --> 33:17.970]  Eric.
[33:18.230 --> 33:19.190]  Hang on, wait, real quick.
[33:19.310 --> 33:22.450]  Hey, get a Kuzler, so when we put the Gerplers back on sale, you don't have to say, like,
[33:22.450 --> 33:23.710]  how come I didn't get a Kuzler, too?
[33:23.730 --> 33:24.250]  Just get it now.
[33:24.810 --> 33:25.770]  Oh, yeah, get it now.
[33:26.390 --> 33:28.050]  I'll probably also fit other stuff.
[33:28.770 --> 33:32.630]  Like, if you got a cup that's big, pretty big, it might fit it.
[33:32.950 --> 33:33.770]  It might.
[33:34.190 --> 33:35.610]  Yeah, or you know what else it might fit?
[33:35.650 --> 33:35.950]  What's that?
[33:39.610 --> 33:40.930]  It's an arm sleeve!
[33:41.170 --> 33:42.650]  Makes a great arm sleeve, too.
[33:42.930 --> 33:45.290]  Like, if you want to play basketball, you don't want to get sweat on your arm.
[33:45.330 --> 33:49.710]  Michael Jordan wore the lower arm sleeve for, like, the early part of his career, and then
[33:49.710 --> 33:51.790]  the upper, I think, black arm sleeve, like this.
[33:51.790 --> 33:52.730]  Wow, multi-use.
[33:53.070 --> 33:53.970]  It is multi-use.
[33:53.970 --> 33:54.710]  You're just like MJ.
[33:55.050 --> 33:55.230]  Wow.
[33:55.230 --> 33:55.970]  Just like MJ.
[33:56.250 --> 33:57.330]  You can be like Mike.
[33:57.390 --> 34:00.970]  Yeah, if you want to be like Mike, buy a Gerpler or a Kuzler.
[34:01.450 --> 34:01.850]  There you go.
[34:01.970 --> 34:04.170]  Did you see the Nike movie, the Air whatever?
[34:04.410 --> 34:04.730]  No, no.
[34:05.010 --> 34:09.590]  I hate that there's a rash of movies that are just like, hey, do you like brand?
[34:10.010 --> 34:11.230]  Yeah, we're gonna...
[34:11.230 --> 34:12.110]  Do you like marketing?
[34:12.530 --> 34:13.270]  Do you like brand?
[34:13.290 --> 34:13.750]  I fucking hate it.
[34:13.830 --> 34:15.310]  It's like, yo, go check it out.
[34:15.330 --> 34:16.210]  This is about Tetris.
[34:16.330 --> 34:20.530]  Do you want the story of why you'll pay $250 for a pair of shoes?
[34:20.530 --> 34:22.470]  It's just so like...
[34:22.470 --> 34:23.930]  And people were like, dude, it was so good.
[34:24.050 --> 34:25.150]  I don't give a fuck.
[34:25.270 --> 34:26.890]  You couldn't pay me to get me to watch that.
[34:27.750 --> 34:30.090]  We're gonna open this now.
[34:30.170 --> 34:31.050]  We've been waiting for this for a while.
[34:31.170 --> 34:32.210]  I bought this.
[34:32.450 --> 34:34.710]  This came out when I was in Italy.
[34:34.970 --> 34:37.290]  I bought this from Italy, had it sent to our house.
[34:37.370 --> 34:39.730]  Then it sat on my front porch for four days, five days.
[34:39.770 --> 34:41.250]  I was so scared it would get stolen.
[34:41.350 --> 34:42.710]  In your neighborhood, it sat there?
[34:42.790 --> 34:44.150]  Yeah, in my ghetto.
[34:45.870 --> 34:47.530]  Panini Prism UFC 2023.
[34:47.530 --> 34:51.390]  The reason that we're opening this, and I've already opened a bunch on Daily Rips,
[34:51.490 --> 34:53.890]  is because Emily is in love with Hasbulla.
[34:54.010 --> 34:54.650]  Short King.
[34:54.950 --> 34:58.390]  And he's got an auto, his first ever card, his rookie auto is in here.
[34:58.590 --> 35:00.970]  And they're going for as much as like $20,000.
[35:01.290 --> 35:01.690]  Wow.
[35:02.930 --> 35:04.690]  And I'm desperate to get a Hasbulla.
[35:04.830 --> 35:07.290]  There'll be two autographs in this box, so let's try it.
[35:07.310 --> 35:08.130]  This is for you, Emily.
[35:08.470 --> 35:09.430]  I love him so much.
[35:09.450 --> 35:10.410]  He's such a little stinker.
[35:10.670 --> 35:13.430]  He's a precocious little guy.
[35:13.710 --> 35:14.370]  He's a little guy.
[35:14.370 --> 35:17.870]  You know what that, whatever that TikTok song that's like, how does it go?
[35:21.660 --> 35:25.920]  And it's always you, and it's that song, and then it's just you looking at pictures of Hasbulla over and over again.
[35:26.940 --> 35:29.540]  Sure, I'm sure. He takes up so much of my feed.
[35:29.800 --> 35:30.440]  Fucking ridiculous.
[35:31.160 --> 35:33.560]  She sits in the bathtub, and I can hear her watching Hasbulla.
[35:33.560 --> 35:34.160]  Oh, it's like Andrew.
[35:34.400 --> 35:35.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[35:36.040 --> 35:37.260]  You're bathtub people like Andrew.
[35:37.420 --> 35:39.340]  I never made that connection, but now I'm grossed out.
[35:40.620 --> 35:41.340]  Yair Rodriguez.
[35:41.980 --> 35:42.200]  Alright.
[35:42.580 --> 35:43.540]  Gary Sandhagen.
[35:43.660 --> 35:44.840]  We're gonna open this whole box up.
[35:44.840 --> 35:46.400]  Michael Morales, just so you know.
[35:46.520 --> 35:46.780]  Let's go.
[35:46.980 --> 35:48.100]  Kyler Phillips.
[35:48.240 --> 35:48.380]  Okay.
[35:48.720 --> 35:49.880]  B.J. Pinn.
[35:50.020 --> 35:50.160]  Nice.
[35:50.340 --> 35:51.120]  Nice, nice.
[35:52.980 --> 35:53.820]  Curtis Blades.
[35:54.020 --> 35:54.420]  Punch.
[35:56.820 --> 35:58.300]  Justin Gota, I guess.
[35:59.360 --> 36:00.140]  I think so, Gota.
[36:02.820 --> 36:03.960]  Vincent Lukey Luke.
[36:05.080 --> 36:05.500]  Vicente?
[36:06.200 --> 36:06.620]  Robert.
[36:07.140 --> 36:08.400]  Oh, it is Vicente, Lukey Luke.
[36:08.560 --> 36:08.800]  Don't matter.
[36:09.400 --> 36:10.240]  Robert Whitaker.
[36:10.420 --> 36:11.060]  You got that one.
[36:11.420 --> 36:12.140]  Here we go.
[36:12.260 --> 36:12.980]  Michael Morales.
[36:12.980 --> 36:15.080]  It looks like he's punching the guy on the top of the head.
[36:16.460 --> 36:17.640]  He's pushing his head down.
[36:17.640 --> 36:18.200]  He's like, ow.
[36:18.380 --> 36:19.120]  He's like, stop.
[36:19.500 --> 36:20.640]  He's like, don't make eye contact with me.
[36:21.740 --> 36:22.940]  Go ahead and squeeze.
[36:23.020 --> 36:24.420]  Go ahead and squeeze that into a sleeve.
[36:25.740 --> 36:27.760]  Ooh, Magomed Ankalev.
[36:27.900 --> 36:29.340]  I've seen that dude fight a bunch.
[36:29.480 --> 36:31.780]  This is his blue wave parallel.
[36:32.100 --> 36:33.140]  What is the...
[36:33.140 --> 36:34.520]  That's gonna be not numbered.
[36:34.940 --> 36:35.640]  What's with the beard?
[36:35.960 --> 36:38.140]  I think it's a religious thing.
[36:38.860 --> 36:40.220]  Is he from Dagestan?
[36:40.620 --> 36:40.880]  Probably.
[36:41.260 --> 36:42.180]  The Amish beard?
[36:42.180 --> 36:44.200]  I don't have a problem with a beard.
[36:44.560 --> 36:46.400]  If that's a religious thing, that's fine.
[36:46.680 --> 36:47.660]  Why no mustache on it?
[36:47.900 --> 36:49.020]  That's the thing that gets me.
[36:49.160 --> 36:49.400]  Why?
[36:49.820 --> 36:50.560]  I don't know.
[36:50.660 --> 36:51.600]  I know, I know.
[36:51.640 --> 36:52.420]  It's weird to me, too.
[36:52.500 --> 36:53.240]  But I think it's cultural.
[36:53.420 --> 36:54.220]  There's this opposite.
[36:54.520 --> 36:55.420]  Israel Adesanya.
[36:55.720 --> 36:56.740]  Hey, all right.
[36:56.960 --> 36:57.520]  What do they call him?
[36:57.580 --> 36:58.280]  The style bender.
[36:58.280 --> 36:59.260]  The style bender, right.
[36:59.300 --> 36:59.980]  The last style bender.
[37:00.200 --> 37:02.120]  He's like the last guy that's really making something happen.
[37:02.340 --> 37:02.600]  He goes all out.
[37:03.100 --> 37:03.640]  That's cool.
[37:03.700 --> 37:07.100]  Watched a couple of Adesanya fights in pay-per-views the last few years.
[37:07.560 --> 37:07.800]  All right.
[37:08.000 --> 37:09.340]  We are going through this whole box, right?
[37:09.380 --> 37:09.980]  We're gonna go through this.
[37:09.980 --> 37:10.780]  There's only like 12 packs.
[37:10.780 --> 37:11.980]  It'll go fast.
[37:12.380 --> 37:13.100]  And there'll be two autographs.
[37:13.120 --> 37:13.880]  Oh, I'm not worried about it going fast.
[37:13.880 --> 37:15.800]  One of them will be Hasbulla, and then we'll be rich.
[37:17.640 --> 37:18.600]  Shavkat Rakamanov.
[37:18.820 --> 37:19.360]  Whoa, cool.
[37:20.700 --> 37:21.660]  Brandon Moreno.
[37:21.840 --> 37:22.220]  Mm-hmm.
[37:24.680 --> 37:25.640]  Manon Floreau.
[37:25.700 --> 37:25.940]  Okay.
[37:29.260 --> 37:30.220]  Umar Nurmagomedov.
[37:32.020 --> 37:32.980]  Raquel Pennington.
[37:33.660 --> 37:35.880]  Oh, Kazmat Chemeyev, again.
[37:36.680 --> 37:37.640]  Tabitha Ricci.
[37:38.460 --> 37:38.940]  Rookie.
[37:39.780 --> 37:40.620]  Sean Woodson.
[37:41.020 --> 37:41.440]  Rookie.
[37:42.520 --> 37:43.360]  Mohamed Mokea.
[37:43.420 --> 37:44.340]  Oh, is it...
[37:44.340 --> 37:44.540]  Rookie.
[37:44.720 --> 37:45.340]  Is it the RC?
[37:45.900 --> 37:46.420]  The RC.
[37:47.120 --> 37:49.200]  Oh, here you go.
[37:50.040 --> 37:50.880]  Havid Basharat.
[37:50.960 --> 37:52.020]  That's a gold parallel.
[37:52.580 --> 37:52.640]  Nice.
[37:52.640 --> 37:53.020]  Which is rookie.
[37:53.160 --> 37:54.800]  That's gonna be number 10, probably.
[37:55.500 --> 37:56.520]  No, I'm sorry.
[37:56.660 --> 37:57.480]  Number 2.
[37:58.180 --> 38:00.120]  71 of 99.
[38:00.560 --> 38:01.880]  I'm gonna just leave that there.
[38:02.400 --> 38:04.320]  And then here we have...
[38:04.320 --> 38:06.540]  I don't know what this parallel is called off the top of my head.
[38:07.040 --> 38:08.920]  But here we have Francis.
[38:08.920 --> 38:09.940]  Francis Ngannou.
[38:10.800 --> 38:12.200]  That's a pretty nice parallel, too.
[38:13.260 --> 38:13.780]  There you go.
[38:14.480 --> 38:15.100]  Just leave that.
[38:15.660 --> 38:16.400]  And then...
[38:17.420 --> 38:18.220]  Aljamain Sterling.
[38:18.760 --> 38:19.500]  He's dominant.
[38:19.740 --> 38:19.960]  All right.
[38:20.040 --> 38:21.980]  Let's get these fucking autographs.
[38:22.060 --> 38:23.480]  I wanna see it.
[38:24.060 --> 38:25.620]  It's so nice having these little card sleeves.
[38:25.800 --> 38:26.500]  It's not bad, right?
[38:26.520 --> 38:27.140]  Isn't that nice?
[38:27.300 --> 38:27.980]  I wanna hit his...
[38:27.980 --> 38:28.900]  They open up easy.
[38:31.100 --> 38:31.900]  Demon Jackson.
[38:32.160 --> 38:32.400]  Okay.
[38:32.840 --> 38:34.000]  Paul Rosas Jr.
[38:34.300 --> 38:35.060]  Did you call him Demon Jackson?
[38:35.060 --> 38:35.420]  I did.
[38:35.520 --> 38:35.980]  Demon Damon.
[38:36.660 --> 38:37.420]  Amanda Nunes.
[38:37.580 --> 38:38.140]  I see her fight up there.
[38:38.140 --> 38:38.900]  She just...
[38:38.900 --> 38:39.740]  She just retired, didn't she?
[38:39.900 --> 38:40.060]  She did.
[38:40.120 --> 38:40.320]  Yeah.
[38:40.480 --> 38:41.580]  She laid her gloves down in the ring.
[38:41.700 --> 38:42.540]  She's like, I can't be beat.
[38:42.640 --> 38:43.740]  And then she laid her gloves down.
[38:44.380 --> 38:45.020]  Jan Blakowicz.
[38:47.720 --> 38:49.000]  Michael Stipe Miocic.
[38:49.860 --> 38:50.180]  Stipe.
[38:52.320 --> 38:52.960]  Penny Kianzad.
[38:54.620 --> 38:55.260]  Cody Darden.
[38:56.820 --> 38:57.440]  Johnny Walker.
[38:57.540 --> 38:58.920]  I watched Johnny Walker fight all the fucking time.
[38:58.960 --> 39:00.200]  That dude is very confident.
[39:01.100 --> 39:01.740]  Michael Pereira.
[39:01.880 --> 39:02.180]  He's got that.
[39:03.380 --> 39:04.020]  Kyler Phillips.
[39:04.280 --> 39:04.600]  Rookie.
[39:04.720 --> 39:04.900]  Nice.
[39:05.560 --> 39:06.200]  Silver Prism.
[39:06.240 --> 39:06.520]  Nice.
[39:06.520 --> 39:07.720]  Can you go ahead and sleep with that, please?
[39:07.840 --> 39:07.980]  Yeah.
[39:08.620 --> 39:08.880]  She just retired, didn't she?
[39:08.880 --> 39:09.960]  Sean Brady.
[39:10.120 --> 39:10.740]  Red Wave.
[39:11.080 --> 39:11.440]  Parallel.
[39:11.500 --> 39:12.040]  That's pretty.
[39:14.740 --> 39:15.100]  Good.
[39:15.700 --> 39:17.660]  And then Francis Ngannou again.
[39:18.040 --> 39:18.400]  Fearless.
[39:18.740 --> 39:19.100]  Parallel.
[39:19.400 --> 39:19.760]  Nice.
[39:21.720 --> 39:22.520]  Still no autograph.
[39:22.720 --> 39:23.840]  These guys are all too tall for me.
[39:24.320 --> 39:24.680]  What?
[39:25.160 --> 39:26.320]  I need my short king.
[39:27.400 --> 39:28.600]  I was about to say, what am I...
[39:28.600 --> 39:30.580]  I always thought if I was 6'2", I wouldn't have any problems.
[39:31.420 --> 39:32.980]  6'2 would be the level of no problems?
[39:33.000 --> 39:33.780]  It's a good one, yeah.
[39:35.280 --> 39:36.300]  Tall, but not too tall.
[39:36.440 --> 39:36.760]  I don't know.
[39:36.860 --> 39:38.120]  Gus is 6'2"...
[39:38.120 --> 39:38.820]  6'1", 6'2"...
[39:38.820 --> 39:40.160]  and his life is nothing but problems.
[39:40.160 --> 39:40.460]  Is he?
[39:41.960 --> 39:42.280]  Mosvar...
[39:42.280 --> 39:44.980]  But when you see Gus, he doesn't exude a 6'2 energy.
[39:45.260 --> 39:45.920]  No, he doesn't.
[39:46.060 --> 39:47.740]  Bernie's 6'2"...
[39:47.740 --> 39:48.160]  or so.
[39:48.240 --> 39:48.840]  6'1", 6'2".
[39:48.840 --> 39:49.280]  I don't believe...
[39:49.280 --> 39:49.940]  He's taller than Gus.
[39:50.780 --> 39:51.400]  Is he really?
[39:51.540 --> 39:53.580]  Yeah, and he also is just a life of misery.
[39:53.700 --> 39:54.000]  I worked with...
[39:54.000 --> 39:54.860]  Andrea Lee.
[39:54.980 --> 39:56.780]  I worked with both of them, and I don't think I'd put...
[39:56.780 --> 39:57.400]  Jeremiah Wells.
[39:57.720 --> 39:58.860]  ...put Bernie at, like, 5'11".
[39:58.860 --> 39:59.580]  No, he's tall.
[39:59.820 --> 40:00.220]  That's the vibe.
[40:00.440 --> 40:01.120]  Dustin Poirier.
[40:04.580 --> 40:05.220]  Andre Petroski.
[40:06.200 --> 40:06.840]  Tisha Torres.
[40:07.800 --> 40:08.580]  Dominic Reyes.
[40:08.640 --> 40:09.360]  I'm going a little faster.
[40:09.460 --> 40:09.920]  Brock Lesnar.
[40:10.520 --> 40:10.800]  Yeah!
[40:12.680 --> 40:13.620]  Save that card.
[40:18.200 --> 40:19.000]  Alton Gelley.
[40:20.580 --> 40:21.380]  Corey Sandhagen.
[40:21.720 --> 40:22.440]  Just leave that, please.
[40:22.460 --> 40:22.800]  That's a good one, too.
[40:23.380 --> 40:24.180]  Terrence McKinney...
[40:24.180 --> 40:24.760]  Rookie Blue Wave.
[40:24.800 --> 40:25.520]  I like that.
[40:25.960 --> 40:27.240]  The Blue Wave is sick.
[40:27.340 --> 40:28.000]  It's really pretty, huh?
[40:28.000 --> 40:28.120]  Yep.
[40:28.800 --> 40:29.200]  Whoa!
[40:29.760 --> 40:30.000]  Look out!
[40:30.220 --> 40:30.980]  Zim's upset.
[40:32.020 --> 40:32.760]  He's upset.
[40:33.380 --> 40:34.120]  Misha Tate.
[40:34.200 --> 40:34.820]  Seen Misha Tate in a bunch.
[40:34.820 --> 40:35.500]  Oh, yeah, Misha Tate.
[40:36.380 --> 40:38.060]  How many more packs do we have?
[40:38.780 --> 40:40.040]  Oh, that's good, we're about halfway.
[40:40.820 --> 40:42.200]  No, we're gonna get... no!
[40:42.640 --> 40:44.840]  It's the right number, because we're gonna get that...
[40:44.840 --> 40:46.420]  I wanted to open some other stuff up, though.
[40:46.420 --> 40:46.780]  We will!
[40:49.540 --> 40:50.380]  Gilbert Burns...
[40:50.380 --> 40:52.640]  Piero Rodriguez, rookie...
[40:52.640 --> 40:54.500]  Matt Schnell...
[40:55.660 --> 40:59.520]  Not to be confused with Matt Schnell, who I knew was an architect.
[41:01.600 --> 41:02.440]  Kaya Carafrance...
[41:02.440 --> 41:03.500]  Irene Aldana...
[41:05.920 --> 41:06.580]  Alishkab...
[41:09.820 --> 41:10.480]  Kisraez...
[41:10.480 --> 41:12.420]  Zhang Whaley...
[41:12.420 --> 41:13.140]  Oh, Sean O'Malley!
[41:13.740 --> 41:14.940]  Everybody loves Sean O'Malley.
[41:15.080 --> 41:16.920]  His hair's always different.
[41:17.080 --> 41:18.760]  He likes hair.
[41:18.940 --> 41:21.440]  He bought stock in Manic Panic.
[41:21.600 --> 41:23.540]  He's got punky colors.
[41:23.960 --> 41:24.940]  Molly McCann...
[41:24.940 --> 41:25.940]  At least he's doing something.
[41:26.520 --> 41:28.560]  This is number 149.
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.260]  This is Melzik Bagdasarian...
[41:32.260 --> 41:33.420]  That's a purple parallel.
[41:33.760 --> 41:35.880]  That's nice. He's kicking hard.
[41:35.940 --> 41:36.520]  He's a hard kicker.
[41:36.560 --> 41:38.080]  Can I get some more sleeves, please?
[41:40.280 --> 41:41.000]  Jailtown Almeda...
[41:41.000 --> 41:41.980]  Red parallel.
[41:42.200 --> 41:43.140]  You can get some of your own.
[41:43.560 --> 41:44.860]  You can throw them everywhere!
[41:47.460 --> 41:48.180]  Dominick Cruz...
[41:48.940 --> 41:50.720]  Dominick, I assume they call him.
[41:51.900 --> 41:53.260]  Two autographs. We haven't had any.
[41:53.600 --> 41:55.020]  We're still at a good place.
[41:55.920 --> 41:56.800]  We're still good.
[41:57.400 --> 41:59.180]  We still haven't not gotten it yet.
[42:01.220 --> 42:02.620]  Khabib...
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.600]  T.J. Dillashaw...
[42:05.600 --> 42:07.180]  Sean Strickland...
[42:08.340 --> 42:09.580]  Mike Mallott...

[42:18.080 --> 42:19.260]  Lauren Murphy...
[42:20.060 --> 42:21.220]  Philip Rowe...
[42:22.200 --> 42:23.660]  Mohamed Mukaev...
[42:23.660 --> 42:24.680]  Silver Prism Rookie...
[42:24.680 --> 42:27.460]  Mark Madsen...
[42:27.460 --> 42:29.870]  Red Wave Parallel Rookie...
[42:30.120 --> 42:31.060]  Let's go in the sleeve of that, too.
[42:31.160 --> 42:32.100]  Conor McGregor...
[42:32.100 --> 42:34.160]  I got you.
[42:35.580 --> 42:36.620]  There you go.
[42:43.480 --> 42:45.420]  Did you peek?
[42:45.920 --> 42:48.460]  Tony Ferguson...
[42:48.710 --> 42:50.460]  Rafael Fiziev...
[42:50.460 --> 42:52.320]  Chris Barnett...
[42:53.020 --> 42:55.020]  Alex Perez...
[42:55.700 --> 42:57.200]  Arnold Allen...
[42:57.200 --> 42:59.160]  Jessica Andrade...
[42:59.160 --> 43:01.240]  Ian Gary...
[43:01.740 --> 43:03.380]  Ian Gary, Wayne Gary...
[43:03.380 --> 43:05.180]  Davidson Figueroa...
[43:05.180 --> 43:06.680]  Here we have a purple...
[43:07.200 --> 43:09.540]  Jake Matthews Rookie Parallel Number...
[43:09.540 --> 43:11.060]  to 149, I believe.
[43:14.520 --> 43:15.440]  Joey Pfeiffer...
[43:18.300 --> 43:18.760]  Dominance...
[43:18.760 --> 43:19.740]  Danielle Cormier...
[43:20.760 --> 43:22.380]  The greatest to ever do it.
[43:23.220 --> 43:24.360]  What do you got going on over there, Eric?
[43:24.360 --> 43:25.900]  Just making sure no one's tweeting at me.
[43:26.060 --> 43:26.660]  Nobody's mad?
[43:27.180 --> 43:28.280]  No, they're all mad.
[43:29.820 --> 43:31.760]  Someone said that...
[43:31.760 --> 43:32.580]  Oh, never mind.
[43:36.240 --> 43:38.400]  I forget that this is...
[43:39.480 --> 43:40.700]  Emily's new to this.
[43:41.820 --> 43:42.160]  Hang on.
[43:42.300 --> 43:43.500]  They can hear what I'm saying?
[43:43.940 --> 43:44.360]  Live?
[43:45.380 --> 43:46.280]  What did you say?
[43:46.880 --> 43:49.040]  I was just going to repeat what someone else said.
[43:49.220 --> 43:51.100]  Why would you ever read the chat?
[43:51.100 --> 43:51.840]  I don't know.
[43:52.040 --> 43:54.720]  Was this what it was like trying to get a PS5?
[43:56.400 --> 43:57.440]  Sergei Pavlovich...
[43:59.340 --> 44:00.380]  Benil Darouche...
[44:01.580 --> 44:02.100]  Macy...
[44:02.100 --> 44:03.100]  Tom Aspinall...
[44:06.380 --> 44:07.420]  Dreykus Duplesis...
[44:07.420 --> 44:09.100]  You should put them a little bit more up.
[44:09.560 --> 44:10.880]  Bryce Mitchell...
[44:11.720 --> 44:13.300]  Alex Pereira again...
[44:13.300 --> 44:14.800]  I got dubs of this guy if anybody wants to trade.
[44:16.800 --> 44:17.840]  Carlos Fulberg...
[44:17.840 --> 44:19.100]  Anthony Hernandez...
[44:20.820 --> 44:21.780]  Silver Prism, please.
[44:22.120 --> 44:23.600]  We have our first...
[44:23.600 --> 44:24.320]  Oh, we got our first auto?
[44:25.540 --> 44:26.380]  We'll get there in a second.
[44:26.620 --> 44:28.740]  Tito Ortiz Hall monitor...
[44:28.740 --> 44:29.600]  Where's your pass?
[44:31.260 --> 44:32.920]  Have you ever seen him
[44:32.920 --> 44:34.080]  in a place called
[44:34.860 --> 44:36.320]  Total Nonstop Action Wrestling
[44:36.320 --> 44:38.380]  where there was a big countdown to like,
[44:38.440 --> 44:40.420]  oh my god, who is going to come out here and be
[44:40.420 --> 44:43.160]  the enforcer who's going to set these guys straight?
[44:43.620 --> 44:45.240]  And it's him, and he comes out,
[44:45.320 --> 44:46.640]  and it's his arms crossed or whatever,
[44:46.640 --> 44:49.120]  and he stands there, and it is...
[44:49.120 --> 44:49.560]  Crickets.
[44:49.900 --> 44:50.320]  Dead silent.
[44:50.500 --> 44:53.320]  The music is playing, and everyone's like,
[44:53.400 --> 44:55.820]  and the audience... nothing.
[44:56.060 --> 44:57.520]  It is brutal.
[44:57.700 --> 44:58.580]  They don't know who he is?
[44:58.880 --> 45:01.540]  I think it's a mix of they don't know who he is,
[45:01.620 --> 45:03.360]  and then other people are going like, oh.
[45:03.720 --> 45:05.760]  Like they expected someone that they give a shit about.
[45:05.920 --> 45:07.980]  It was different, so it was very funny.
[45:08.540 --> 45:09.780]  And here we have our autograph.
[45:09.980 --> 45:11.520]  It's not our Shark King, but it is
[45:11.520 --> 45:14.400]  a very famous fighter, Merab Dvalishvali.
[45:14.400 --> 45:15.020]  Really?
[45:16.100 --> 45:18.540]  And he's got a great signature.
[45:18.720 --> 45:20.840]  That is an awesome signature.
[45:20.840 --> 45:21.640]  He took his time.
[45:22.520 --> 45:23.880]  That's not a house show signature, man.
[45:24.020 --> 45:26.260]  Let's go and sleeve that.
[45:26.300 --> 45:27.760]  That's actually a lovely card.
[45:28.420 --> 45:29.200]  Even if it's not...
[45:29.760 --> 45:31.120]  He's got that hair.
[45:31.260 --> 45:33.440]  That's not real hair. That's a hat he wears.
[45:33.860 --> 45:36.000]  It's like a ceremonial garb.
[45:36.020 --> 45:38.760]  That would feel like an extra protection.
[45:38.940 --> 45:39.720]  Daniel Rodriguez.
[45:41.020 --> 45:41.860]  Jordan Levin.
[45:41.860 --> 45:42.840]  Hit him in the hair.
[45:42.940 --> 45:43.620]  Jordan Levin?
[45:45.200 --> 45:46.960]  That's why you don't fuck around with Jordan Levin.
[45:47.480 --> 45:49.300]  You're fucking crazy strong.
[45:51.440 --> 45:52.040]  Sayyukab
[45:52.920 --> 45:53.520]  Kakramanov.
[45:54.200 --> 45:54.480]  Okay.
[45:56.700 --> 45:57.900]  Cheyenne Vlizmus.
[45:58.500 --> 46:00.080]  Al Jermaine Sterling.
[46:00.480 --> 46:01.260]  Seen him fight.
[46:01.700 --> 46:03.400]  Tabitha Ricci. Not related
[46:03.400 --> 46:05.760]  to Christina Ricci, to my knowledge.
[46:06.040 --> 46:07.240]  Sean Woodson.
[46:07.860 --> 46:08.280]  Rookie card.
[46:08.280 --> 46:09.080]  I've got enough.
[46:11.060 --> 46:12.220]  Mohamed Mokaev.
[46:12.520 --> 46:14.120]  Anthony Hernandez.
[46:17.600 --> 46:18.760]  Shavkat Rakhmanov.
[46:20.240 --> 46:21.400]  It's just a red parallel.
[46:21.680 --> 46:23.280]  That's number 199.
[46:24.580 --> 46:26.600]  Here we have T.J. Dillashaw.
[46:27.040 --> 46:28.120]  We'll give that to you.
[46:28.400 --> 46:30.860]  He is looking a little rough
[46:30.860 --> 46:31.260]  in that one.
[46:31.460 --> 46:32.700]  It's a rough business.
[46:33.120 --> 46:35.040]  I know, you're getting exhausted.
[46:35.040 --> 46:35.640]  Is that the last one?
[46:36.020 --> 46:37.680]  We're almost there.
[46:37.940 --> 46:39.080]  We're going to stop after the auto.
[46:39.640 --> 46:41.940]  Okay, here we go.
[46:42.580 --> 46:44.240]  It's getting down to the wire.
[46:44.960 --> 46:46.700]  Jim Prochazka.
[46:47.380 --> 46:49.000]  Aaron Blanchfield.
[46:49.540 --> 46:51.320]  Pat Sabatini.
[46:51.980 --> 46:53.040]  Jack Hermanson.
[46:55.000 --> 46:56.440]  Ilya Toporiya.
[46:56.960 --> 46:57.600]  Oh, look.
[46:57.700 --> 46:58.620]  Conor McGregor.
[46:59.040 --> 47:00.660]  Just a cross shot.
[47:01.480 --> 47:02.960]  Going on in his pants.
[47:02.960 --> 47:04.740]  Is that after he broke his ankle?
[47:04.740 --> 47:06.700]  Yeah, you can't see his legs flop around.
[47:07.880 --> 47:08.760]  Michael Chandler.
[47:09.420 --> 47:10.300]  Jennifer Maya.
[47:10.840 --> 47:12.760]  We have a red parallel of
[47:12.760 --> 47:13.980]  Alexander Volkov.
[47:14.680 --> 47:15.940]  That's a lovely card.
[47:16.340 --> 47:18.120]  We have Sean Strickland.
[47:19.040 --> 47:21.140]  And then a Cody Sandhagen.
[47:21.280 --> 47:22.320]  I'll give that to you as well.
[47:22.820 --> 47:24.140]  Is this the last one?
[47:24.400 --> 47:26.940]  So we definitely have an auto in one of these.
[47:27.040 --> 47:28.920]  Yeah, we definitely have an auto.
[47:29.140 --> 47:31.220]  Or we have a complaint to issue
[47:31.220 --> 47:32.540]  to Panini.
[47:32.720 --> 47:34.640]  You can tweet at Gavin about it.
[47:35.520 --> 47:37.360]  Tied to Avasa.
[47:37.920 --> 47:39.220]  David Dvorak.
[47:40.160 --> 47:41.220]  Complaint to Gavin.
[47:41.400 --> 47:43.200]  CTG. Mark Madsen.
[47:44.140 --> 47:45.340]  Sean Brady.
[47:46.600 --> 47:47.600]  Michelle Waterson.
[47:48.540 --> 47:50.060]  Charles Oliveira.
[47:50.180 --> 47:51.000]  I've seen him fight a bunch.
[47:51.380 --> 47:52.380]  Ketlyn Vieira.
[47:53.860 --> 47:55.500]  Jailtown Almeida.
[47:56.520 --> 47:57.300]  Daron Till.
[47:57.460 --> 47:58.880]  Michael Perriera.
[47:59.520 --> 48:00.240]  Blue parallel.
[48:00.400 --> 48:01.580]  Number to 175.
[48:02.240 --> 48:03.620]  There's some good cards in here.
[48:03.680 --> 48:06.260]  You get high hits and stuff.
[48:07.100 --> 48:08.220]  Here's a red parallel.
[48:08.960 --> 48:10.020]  Red Wave. Damon Till.
[48:10.460 --> 48:11.000]  Here you go.
[48:11.940 --> 48:12.660]  Sean O'Malley.
[48:14.700 --> 48:15.860]  We're going to go down to the last pack.
[48:15.960 --> 48:17.860]  This is going to be the pack where we get the $20,000
[48:18.820 --> 48:19.180]  Hasbulla.
[48:19.920 --> 48:21.780]  I think the 1 of 1 already came out.
[48:22.140 --> 48:22.880]  Here it comes.
[48:23.180 --> 48:23.500]  Got it.
[48:28.980 --> 48:30.880]  I'm not going to peek.
[48:31.320 --> 48:33.200]  Max Holloway.
[48:35.060 --> 48:36.980]  Kareem Silva.
[48:37.960 --> 48:39.780]  Israel Adesanya.
[48:42.700 --> 48:45.260]  Nasordine Ameyabov.
[48:45.680 --> 48:47.180]  Bilal Muhammad.
[48:48.060 --> 48:49.360]  Luana Pinheiro.
[48:50.440 --> 48:52.320]  Geoff Spells Like Me Neal.
[48:52.900 --> 48:54.840]  Amanda Lemos.
[48:55.160 --> 48:55.620]  Here you go.
[48:55.620 --> 48:56.160]  We're getting there.
[48:56.300 --> 48:58.580]  Jake Matthews.
[49:00.740 --> 49:01.940]  Anderson Silva.
[49:02.980 --> 49:04.540]  Got a silver prism.
[49:04.700 --> 49:05.840]  Tom Aspinall.
[49:06.380 --> 49:06.580]  Don't look.
[49:07.540 --> 49:08.720]  I'm going to flip it over.
[49:10.040 --> 49:11.020]  Misha Tate.
[49:11.220 --> 49:12.380]  That's a really good card.
[49:13.560 --> 49:14.280]  I'll take that.
[49:14.680 --> 49:16.020]  Hell yeah.
[49:16.120 --> 49:16.800]  Misha Tate auto.
[49:19.420 --> 49:21.300]  It wasn't your short king.
[49:21.300 --> 49:22.680]  It was...
[49:24.380 --> 49:26.860]  Are we trapped in the matrix?
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.020]  That was like a cyber fart.
[49:28.100 --> 49:29.140]  What the fuck?
[49:30.200 --> 49:31.780]  Let's open up something funny.
[49:33.480 --> 49:34.720]  We'll get rid of all that trash.
[49:35.280 --> 49:37.080]  Let's do some vampire diaries.
[49:37.100 --> 49:37.800]  God damn it.
[49:38.720 --> 49:39.460]  These suck.
[49:40.780 --> 49:41.660]  Just throw it on the ground.
[49:42.640 --> 49:43.940]  Throw it on the ground.
[49:44.780 --> 49:46.180]  You just put it right on the ground.
[49:46.280 --> 49:46.960]  We're animals here.
[49:46.960 --> 49:48.220]  And then we will get it later.
[49:48.360 --> 49:49.280]  See? Problem solved.
[49:49.940 --> 49:51.740]  Don't forget all that trash.
[49:52.860 --> 49:53.740]  Oh no.
[49:54.360 --> 49:56.720]  Somebody's got a not so fine romance.
[49:57.720 --> 49:58.880]  Show the stupid card.
[49:59.320 --> 49:59.580]  These suck.
[50:01.340 --> 50:02.720]  Here's Jeremy Gilbert.
[50:02.900 --> 50:04.660]  Michael keeps telling me facts about this show
[50:04.660 --> 50:05.480]  and I don't want to hear it.
[50:05.640 --> 50:07.420]  I don't like it. I don't want to see it.
[50:07.540 --> 50:09.080]  These two are in harm's way.
[50:10.300 --> 50:13.520]  That guy is the most actor looking dude I've ever seen.
[50:13.720 --> 50:14.840]  They're probably vampires
[50:14.840 --> 50:16.120]  and that's clearly sunlight.
[50:16.540 --> 50:19.000]  Look at the shape of that dude's head.
[50:19.440 --> 50:19.840]  Wow.
[50:20.020 --> 50:23.040]  If you look at it for too long, you start to get a little Neanderthal look.
[50:23.380 --> 50:24.760]  He's got vampire blood.
[50:25.140 --> 50:25.980]  Bonnie's plan.
[50:26.200 --> 50:26.700]  It's like our wedding.
[50:29.260 --> 50:30.960]  And then a piece of a puzzle.
[50:31.460 --> 50:32.820]  Yay! Throwing the trash away with trash.
[50:33.420 --> 50:34.400]  Now, what are we doing? Alf.
[50:34.460 --> 50:35.460]  He said...
[50:36.720 --> 50:38.380]  Let's do whatever this is.
[50:38.460 --> 50:40.340]  Tops, chrome, platinum anniversary, baseball.
[50:40.340 --> 50:40.740]  Okay.
[50:40.740 --> 50:41.420]  Okay.
[50:41.420 --> 50:42.900]  Do you know what year this is?
[50:46.080 --> 50:47.160]  So, 20...
[50:47.160 --> 50:48.200]  21.
[50:48.420 --> 50:48.600]  Okay.
[50:49.620 --> 50:50.700]  Andrew McCutcheon.
[50:51.280 --> 50:53.300]  When he was with the Phillies. Back with the Pirates.
[50:53.740 --> 50:55.320]  Marcus Seaman.
[50:57.340 --> 50:58.420]  Chris Bubick.
[50:58.740 --> 50:58.920]  Rookie.
[50:59.920 --> 51:01.500]  And then Marcel Ozuna.
[51:01.880 --> 51:02.140]  Okay.
[51:02.660 --> 51:05.120]  I know you want to keep it.
[51:06.620 --> 51:07.360]  What's his deal?
[51:08.100 --> 51:08.700]  Poo-poo?
[51:09.300 --> 51:10.400]  Poo-poo, no good good?
[51:10.700 --> 51:12.220]  Bad news.
[51:12.400 --> 51:14.340]  Let's open up a...
[51:14.340 --> 51:15.940]  Like bad news plane or bad news...
[51:17.120 --> 51:18.780]  Like bad news is a guy.
[51:20.260 --> 51:21.680]  Bad news, the person.
[51:22.060 --> 51:22.960]  Bad news, the person.
[51:23.860 --> 51:25.360]  Let's open up a...
[51:28.580 --> 51:29.800]  What are we doing?
[51:31.080 --> 51:32.340]  First off, we're going to open up for Eric.
[51:32.720 --> 51:34.360]  Game of Thrones. He loves it.
[51:34.360 --> 51:36.200]  Can't get enough of Game of Thrones.
[51:38.420 --> 51:40.120]  Lord Mace Tyrell.
[51:40.340 --> 51:42.620]  Oh, there's the High Sparrow.
[51:42.880 --> 51:43.640]  Take a shower.
[51:43.980 --> 51:45.960]  Everybody remembers Leaf.
[51:47.120 --> 51:47.300]  Who?
[51:49.080 --> 51:49.960]  Dario Naharis.
[51:50.580 --> 51:51.640]  Oh, that guy.
[51:52.240 --> 51:53.480]  Go ahead and sleeve that, I guess.
[51:53.880 --> 51:55.340]  We've got to sleeve Dario, bro.
[51:56.300 --> 51:57.900]  See, you're like, I don't know about this.
[51:58.200 --> 52:00.920]  Our sleeves are coming in handy like crazy.
[52:00.940 --> 52:01.380]  They're great.
[52:01.380 --> 52:01.820]  Look at this shit.
[52:02.120 --> 52:05.740]  Do you guys remember everybody's favorite Game of Thrones character, One-One?
[52:06.920 --> 52:08.920]  Is that the big giant that came through?
[52:09.500 --> 52:11.160]  I didn't know that he had a name.
[52:11.260 --> 52:14.460]  That is where I just fall off with this show so much.
[52:14.480 --> 52:15.660]  When it gets into high fantasy.
[52:15.980 --> 52:17.120]  And it's just like...
[52:17.120 --> 52:19.140]  I liked it better when it was political intrigue.
[52:19.240 --> 52:21.500]  And then they're like, guess what? Giants are real.
[52:21.660 --> 52:22.240]  And I'm like, oh.
[52:22.780 --> 52:24.700]  He was an important ally to Jon Snow, though.
[52:24.760 --> 52:27.300]  Who cares? I don't like it.
[52:27.700 --> 52:28.140]  We care.
[52:29.760 --> 52:30.160]  No.
[52:30.660 --> 52:31.400]  What do we got?
[52:31.600 --> 52:32.520]  Eric, this is for you.
[52:32.660 --> 52:33.840]  This is all for you, buddy.
[52:34.280 --> 52:36.160]  We'll put one pack in the pack sack.
[52:38.700 --> 52:39.500]  Prism WWE.
[52:39.600 --> 52:40.880]  Hot off the presses.
[52:41.000 --> 52:41.500]  Just came out.
[52:41.620 --> 52:43.300]  2023 WWE Prism.
[52:43.400 --> 52:45.540]  There is an AEW pay-per-view this weekend.
[52:45.620 --> 52:48.920]  It is Forbidden Door.
[52:49.200 --> 52:53.040]  It will be AEW wrestlers against New Japan Pro Wrestling wrestlers.
[52:53.300 --> 52:54.300]  It will be very, very good.
[52:54.380 --> 52:55.840]  And do they go through the Forbidden Door?
[52:55.840 --> 52:57.860]  They do. They kick open the Forbidden Door, baby.
[52:58.180 --> 53:00.260]  There's a new show in Scorpio Skies back, baby.
[53:00.600 --> 53:01.640]  Are you familiar with Shawn Michaels?
[53:01.900 --> 53:03.740]  I am. The Heartbreak Kid.
[53:04.380 --> 53:06.120]  It's a super kick. Sweet Chin Music.
[53:06.340 --> 53:08.160]  Are you familiar with Finn Balor?
[53:08.260 --> 53:10.400]  Finn Balor, yeah. He's great. I like Finn Balor a lot.
[53:10.560 --> 53:12.900]  Here's a green Prism parallel of Kit Wilson.
[53:13.100 --> 53:14.500]  Oh, from Pretty Deadly.
[53:14.860 --> 53:16.460]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm trying to keep up.
[53:16.680 --> 53:17.540]  R-Truth.
[53:17.900 --> 53:19.880]  R-Truth. Ron, the Truth Killings.
[53:20.220 --> 53:22.540]  Wrestled with Pac-Man Jones.
[53:22.840 --> 53:23.080]  Oh.
[53:23.080 --> 53:25.200]  In Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.
[53:25.340 --> 53:25.920]  How did that go?
[53:27.600 --> 53:28.780]  You never heard about it.
[53:29.560 --> 53:30.580]  Okay, there you go.
[53:31.560 --> 53:32.520]  Josh Briggs.
[53:33.000 --> 53:33.820]  I think he's an NXT guy.
[53:33.820 --> 53:34.860]  Not as high of a kick.
[53:36.600 --> 53:37.520]  He's more of a stomp.
[53:37.580 --> 53:39.640]  There is a referee on NXT.
[53:40.200 --> 53:42.920]  TV referee on NXT who's a big fan of Anma
[53:42.920 --> 53:44.160]  and Tales from the Stinky Dragon.
[53:44.460 --> 53:46.840]  Friendly with him on Instagram. Cool dude.
[53:47.260 --> 53:47.960]  What is he?
[53:48.040 --> 53:50.340]  He's a referee here in WWE.
[53:50.340 --> 53:51.060]  No shit.
[53:51.360 --> 53:53.140]  Does he have a card?
[53:53.860 --> 53:55.280]  I doubt he has a card.
[53:55.460 --> 53:57.700]  But he was the first winner of Raw Underground.
[53:58.160 --> 53:59.340]  I want to know. I want to see him.
[53:59.480 --> 54:01.300]  Fallon Henley. Do you know that?
[54:01.400 --> 54:02.540]  Yeah, I know Fallon Henley.
[54:02.860 --> 54:04.800]  Madcap Moss. Silver Prism.
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  Do we like Madcap Moss? Is he a bad dude?
[54:07.020 --> 54:08.080]  I wish they'd change his name.
[54:09.320 --> 54:10.080]  Madcap Moss.
[54:12.500 --> 54:13.260]  Amari Miller.
[54:14.580 --> 54:15.920]  Do we know Amari Miller?
[54:16.120 --> 54:18.720]  I think these are newer NXT people that I'm less familiar with.
[54:19.320 --> 54:21.460]  We finally found the limit of Eric Follin.
[54:21.600 --> 54:23.980]  The brand has really expanded into people I've never heard of.
[54:24.300 --> 54:26.730]  The Almighty Bobby Lashley.
[54:27.520 --> 54:28.640]  That's a cool card.
[54:28.800 --> 54:30.500]  He looks like an avatar.
[54:30.820 --> 54:31.560]  Dude, he's awesome.
[54:31.700 --> 54:34.320]  He was the Bellator Champion, I think, for a while.
[54:34.440 --> 54:35.100]  He's an MMA guy.
[54:35.360 --> 54:38.720]  He looks like the dude from Captain Midnight.
[54:39.620 --> 54:40.300]  Professor Midnight.
[54:41.120 --> 54:42.680]  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
[54:43.060 --> 54:44.760]  The purple dude with the big dong
[54:44.760 --> 54:46.500]  that was played by Billy... what's his name?
[54:47.560 --> 54:47.920]  Grimace?
[54:49.960 --> 54:51.200]  It's his birthday coming up.
[54:51.500 --> 54:52.600]  He's celebrating it at McDonald's.
[54:54.000 --> 54:55.140]  He's got his own milkshake and everything.
[54:55.860 --> 54:56.700]  He made it with a big dong.
[54:56.720 --> 54:58.100]  We did it on FaceJam this week.
[54:58.200 --> 54:58.860]  Go listen to FaceJam.
[54:59.800 --> 55:00.520]  Dr. Science?
[55:03.200 --> 55:03.920]  Professor Plum?
[55:04.020 --> 55:05.960]  No, it was like...
[55:07.380 --> 55:07.740]  Manhattan.
[55:08.220 --> 55:08.720]  Dr. Manhattan.
[55:09.500 --> 55:10.220]  Jesus Christ.
[55:11.320 --> 55:14.380]  There's people at home screaming about the Gerpler and us not getting that name.
[55:14.380 --> 55:15.600]  Gable Stevenson.
[55:16.360 --> 55:17.360]  Cracked Ice Parallel.
[55:17.480 --> 55:20.360]  That's an Olympic wrestler who joined WWE.
[55:20.680 --> 55:21.300]  Oh, no shit.
[55:21.940 --> 55:23.600]  Speaking of Olympics...
[55:23.600 --> 55:25.960]  Macho Man Randy Satton.
[55:26.020 --> 55:27.620]  Legends of the Hall.
[55:28.200 --> 55:30.140]  Then we also have Carmelo Hayes.
[55:30.220 --> 55:31.580]  He's the NXT Champion right now.
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.460]  Not to be confused with Carmelo Anthony.
[55:33.620 --> 55:34.580]  He's retired from the NBA.
[55:34.820 --> 55:36.540]  I think that's probably where the name came from.
[55:37.600 --> 55:38.520]  Do Cudson.
[55:39.140 --> 55:41.060]  Do Cudson is now in Chase U.
[55:41.060 --> 55:42.760]  Dude, look at how he's lifting that guy up.
[55:42.800 --> 55:44.880]  He's big. He's like 6'5". He's huge.
[55:44.960 --> 55:46.340]  Talk about huge.
[55:46.580 --> 55:47.440]  Scott Steiner.
[55:48.680 --> 55:50.140]  If you hear me...
[55:50.140 --> 55:52.000]  We did, when we were doing Wrestling of the Week,
[55:52.280 --> 55:54.940]  I grew out my goatee and I did it like Scott Steiner
[55:54.940 --> 55:57.540]  and then bought the sunglasses and the chainmail.
[55:57.600 --> 55:58.100]  I remember that.
[55:58.120 --> 56:00.600]  I don't have the arms like Scott, but we're trying.
[56:01.380 --> 56:02.060]  Get that tonal.
[56:02.280 --> 56:02.980]  Who's Omos?
[56:03.680 --> 56:04.120]  Omos.
[56:04.800 --> 56:06.580]  Where's my Omosapiens out there, bro?
[56:06.580 --> 56:07.980]  Is that what they're called? Omosapiens?
[56:09.040 --> 56:10.800]  Fans online, they just became a meme
[56:10.800 --> 56:12.560]  and people are like, we're Omosapiens and it's great.
[56:12.980 --> 56:14.800]  Rhea Ripley. I think she's the RAW
[56:14.800 --> 56:16.860]  Women's Champion. She's awesome. She's really good.
[56:16.920 --> 56:18.720]  She's Australian and she is big
[56:18.720 --> 56:20.580]  and strong. Well, she's strong. She's like, I think
[56:20.580 --> 56:22.040]  5'4". A lot of big, strong people in Australia.
[56:22.880 --> 56:23.600]  Wes Lee.
[56:24.080 --> 56:26.620]  Not to be related, not to be confused with
[56:26.620 --> 56:28.500]  Wes Ellis. No, different. He's a different guy.
[56:29.300 --> 56:30.020]  Sonia Deville.
[56:30.240 --> 56:32.600]  Sonia Deville is a former MMA fighter. She's very
[56:32.600 --> 56:34.760]  cool. Cracked Ice.
[56:35.480 --> 56:36.240]  Oh, shit.
[56:36.840 --> 56:38.580]  Here's Bayley. She doesn't get two names.
[56:38.860 --> 56:40.400]  Bayley! No, she gets one name.
[56:40.560 --> 56:42.340]  And then here we have a very...
[56:42.340 --> 56:44.160]  Number 2 to 25.
[56:44.540 --> 56:46.760]  This is a pink, I think, disco...
[56:47.600 --> 56:48.300]  Might not be disco.
[56:50.380 --> 56:51.140]  Ashante Adonis.
[56:51.200 --> 56:52.640]  Okay. He's on SmackDown.
[56:52.820 --> 56:54.700]  Number 2 to 25. That's a huge hit.
[56:54.720 --> 56:56.420]  He's a hit row. He's in a little group.
[56:56.680 --> 56:57.740]  Is that the referee in the background?
[56:58.260 --> 57:00.840]  No, that's not him. What if we found a card
[57:00.840 --> 57:01.840]  with that guy in the background?
[57:02.460 --> 57:03.900]  So, NXT is coming
[57:03.900 --> 57:05.740]  to Austin. They're doing a show
[57:05.740 --> 57:07.900]  at the end of August, maybe?
[57:08.060 --> 57:09.860]  Maybe the end of July, at Cedar Park.
[57:10.660 --> 57:11.780]  And I'm like, dude, you gotta
[57:11.780 --> 57:13.780]  come to that show. He's like, I'm trying. So, I think that
[57:13.780 --> 57:15.820]  would be cool. Here's something I want to open
[57:15.820 --> 57:17.780]  up for you guys. When I was in Italy, I
[57:17.780 --> 57:19.780]  bought a bunch of cards everywhere I could. I looked at
[57:19.780 --> 57:21.920]  Emily Can Vouch. I went to every fucking store in Italy
[57:21.920 --> 57:23.740]  and I bought every time I saw cards, which wasn't a lot.
[57:23.980 --> 57:25.100]  This is Score
[57:26.620 --> 57:27.260]  Series A
[57:27.740 --> 57:28.720]  Soccer Trading Cards.
[57:29.900 --> 57:30.880]  It's owned by
[57:30.880 --> 57:32.720]  Panini. It used to be a baseball
[57:32.720 --> 57:34.760]  card brand, back in the 90s. I guess
[57:34.760 --> 57:36.340]  they probably still are. They do, like
[57:37.040 --> 57:38.060]  honestly, lower end.
[57:38.420 --> 57:38.660]  No!
[57:42.100 --> 57:42.900]  Gianmarco Ferrari
[57:43.840 --> 57:44.580]  Gianmarco Ferrari
[57:44.580 --> 57:46.580]  That guy plays
[57:46.580 --> 57:48.520]  soccer, football over there, for fun.
[57:49.000 --> 57:50.300]  He's from the Ferrari family.
[57:50.540 --> 57:52.460]  He's worth $100 billion. Is that for real?
[57:52.640 --> 57:53.860]  I made it up. Wow.
[57:55.300 --> 57:56.100]  Gianluca Caprari
[57:56.100 --> 57:57.140]  Giorgio
[57:58.280 --> 57:58.960]  Cappadopolis
[58:00.220 --> 58:02.080]  Danny Moda, rookie
[58:02.800 --> 58:04.000]  These are from
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.880]  Philippe Costic
[58:05.880 --> 58:08.220]  Is this like an Italian league thing?
[58:08.340 --> 58:09.900]  Yeah, this is La Liga, I think.
[58:10.740 --> 58:12.340]  Ionut Radu, rookie
[58:12.340 --> 58:13.880]  These came all the way
[58:13.880 --> 58:15.720]  from Italy in my suitcase.
[58:16.200 --> 58:18.360]  Alexa Terzic
[58:18.360 --> 58:20.080]  I bought these in
[58:20.080 --> 58:22.420]  Venice, Italy
[58:23.480 --> 58:24.160]  Joachim
[58:24.160 --> 58:26.120]  An M, and then an A
[58:26.120 --> 58:27.720]  and an E together. Oh, man.
[58:28.180 --> 58:29.880]  What does that make? I don't know.
[58:29.980 --> 58:31.540]  Isn't that what Elon's kid's name?
[58:32.060 --> 58:34.380]  Oh! I think you...
[58:34.380 --> 58:35.580]  It may be part of it.
[58:36.420 --> 58:37.720]  Angel de Maria
[58:38.280 --> 58:40.240]  and then David Zima
[58:40.240 --> 58:41.180]  Okay. There you go.
[58:41.700 --> 58:43.680]  I think we have time for one more
[58:43.680 --> 58:45.700]  good pack that you want to do.
[58:45.900 --> 58:46.960]  One that you're feeling, Geoff.
[58:47.500 --> 58:50.200]  See, this is why I ask, what do you want
[58:50.200 --> 58:52.120]  to open? You said we have time
[58:52.120 --> 58:53.020]  for... What's after this?
[58:53.780 --> 58:54.240]  I don't know.
[58:55.600 --> 58:56.800]  We have to be done by 12.05.
[58:57.120 --> 58:59.340]  Hard out of 12.05.
[58:59.460 --> 59:00.680]  So we got...

[59:08.120 --> 59:09.960]  We're going to open until Cody
[59:09.960 --> 59:10.640]  shuts us off.
[59:11.420 --> 59:13.220]  We'll keep going and he'll just be yelling,

[59:22.540 --> 59:23.580]  I'm racing the clock.

[59:35.420 --> 59:36.000]  And then here we go.
[59:36.080 --> 59:37.700]  This is it. It's still 11.59.
[59:37.820 --> 59:38.480]  I can still keep going.

[59:43.700 --> 59:45.340]  He just won the
[59:45.340 --> 59:48.140]  championship. And then I went to
[59:48.140 --> 59:49.740]  Denver and then we were at the airport
[59:49.740 --> 59:52.140]  and it was outdated
[59:52.140 --> 59:54.220]  on the tram and it was the mayor going
[59:54.220 --> 59:56.200]  Go Nuggets! Win the Western Conference
[59:56.200 --> 59:58.340]  Championship! And everyone on the

[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.340]  Is this when he was the player coach?
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:26.080]  Yeah, that was when he was...
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.160]  No, that was when he was on the nets.

[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.640]  He's got his beat off glove on.

[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.360]  get you a Gerpler.
