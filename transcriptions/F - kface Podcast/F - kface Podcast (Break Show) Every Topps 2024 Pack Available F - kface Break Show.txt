[00:07.530 --> 00:08.250]  We're live!
[00:09.110 --> 00:13.690]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Face Break Show.
[00:13.890 --> 00:18.170]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Emily, my wife,
[00:19.110 --> 00:21.030]  and Eric, my friend.
[00:22.090 --> 00:25.310]  And we're going to do a bunch of fun shit today. Stuff.
[00:25.410 --> 00:27.450]  I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to swear in the first five minutes or something.
[00:27.630 --> 00:30.010]  I don't know who you're apologizing to. You already said it.
[00:30.910 --> 00:31.530]  But that's a good point.
[00:31.850 --> 00:33.090]  Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[00:33.250 --> 00:35.110]  Well, not going to help us. Trouble shits. OK.
[00:35.110 --> 00:38.390]  Uh, so today we're going to do what we always do.
[00:38.630 --> 00:41.230]  We're going to talk about some of the stuff that came out last week
[00:41.230 --> 00:42.170]  and what it graded out at.
[00:42.250 --> 00:45.010]  I want to do a little show and tell for some stuff that I got over the weekend.
[00:45.170 --> 00:46.510]  We'll open a little bit of mail.
[00:46.870 --> 00:50.590]  We'll open up Emily's Disney cutie cuffs, see if we can get her.
[00:51.110 --> 00:52.670]  Who's are you looking for? Marie. Marie.
[00:52.850 --> 00:53.370]  Yeah. Yeah.
[00:53.590 --> 00:56.070]  And then we're going to do something special today.
[00:56.110 --> 00:56.970]  What? Yeah.
[00:57.330 --> 00:59.890]  I do something special in honor of Topps Baseball
[00:59.890 --> 01:02.930]  2024 series one coming out, which is like the big baseball product.
[01:03.510 --> 01:07.950]  I have gone and I have purchased, you know, cut to my screen,
[01:09.910 --> 01:13.010]  every single kind of box.
[01:13.070 --> 01:16.150]  Holy shit. You can buy
[01:17.250 --> 01:19.030]  of Topps 2024.
[01:20.290 --> 01:24.950]  This is if you as far as I'm aware, there's no other way to buy the cards.
[01:25.050 --> 01:25.770]  That's pretty awesome.
[01:25.970 --> 01:29.350]  Now that you've messed them all up, why don't you go ahead
[01:29.350 --> 01:30.470]  and tell me what they're all called?
[01:30.590 --> 01:32.210]  Oh, I can easily do that. Thank you very much.
[01:33.050 --> 01:36.610]  This is what's called a fat pack or a solo pack.
[01:36.750 --> 01:38.450]  Got it. Retail product.
[01:38.590 --> 01:39.730]  This is what's called a hanger.
[01:40.050 --> 01:42.750]  Retail product. As they say, hangers are bangers.
[01:43.390 --> 01:45.970]  This is what's called a retail box.
[01:46.170 --> 01:49.230]  It's designed to be opened up and sold individual packs.
[01:49.330 --> 01:50.070]  Is there a rhyme for that?
[01:50.310 --> 01:51.530]  I don't know. All right. Just making sure.
[01:51.610 --> 01:54.570]  This is what's called a hobby mega box.
[01:54.670 --> 01:56.730]  This is the most expensive of the products.
[01:56.870 --> 01:59.910]  I don't remember how much I paid for this, but it was probably three or 400 bucks.
[01:59.990 --> 02:00.790]  How many packs are in that?
[02:01.270 --> 02:04.630]  I don't know how many packs are in it, but it's going to have an auto and two relics.
[02:04.710 --> 02:05.590]  Does it say it right on the side there?
[02:06.530 --> 02:08.730]  It's 40, 10 packs, 40 cards per pack.
[02:09.070 --> 02:11.710]  Cool. Then we have just a regular hobby box.
[02:12.090 --> 02:14.770]  This would be the most common, I think, collector box.
[02:15.550 --> 02:17.650]  You're going to have one autograph and one or relic.
[02:19.210 --> 02:21.150]  Then blasters, which is how this is retail.
[02:21.250 --> 02:23.730]  This is how most people probably buy cards these days.
[02:23.870 --> 02:25.850]  Blasters would be the most common way to buy a card.
[02:26.650 --> 02:31.670]  Then we have the monster box.
[02:31.710 --> 02:33.610]  This is a retail product.
[02:33.650 --> 02:35.370]  I've never seen it before.
[02:35.430 --> 02:36.230]  I don't know.
[02:37.850 --> 02:39.550]  I bought it online, but supposedly.
[02:39.830 --> 02:40.170]  What's in it?
[02:40.870 --> 02:42.430]  Just all the same shit.
[02:42.750 --> 02:46.890]  So this one has Tops Foil Board, 1989 Tops Foil Board.
[02:46.990 --> 02:48.650]  How many packs and how many cards?
[02:48.810 --> 02:51.210]  How many packs? 16 packs, 14 cards per pack.
[02:51.270 --> 02:52.610]  Got it. 224 total cards.
[02:52.650 --> 02:54.610]  Wow. And then this is what's called a mega box.
[02:54.610 --> 02:56.070]  This is also a retail box.
[02:56.690 --> 02:57.910]  This is about 60 bucks.
[02:58.070 --> 03:02.110]  This is 16 packs, 14 cards per box.
[03:02.170 --> 03:03.230]  And what's the name of this one one more time?
[03:03.650 --> 03:05.410]  This is the Jumbo Hobby.
[03:05.690 --> 03:07.230]  Got it. OK. Jumbo Mega Hobby.
[03:07.250 --> 03:09.950]  You can see the difference a little bit better if you do it like this.
[03:09.970 --> 03:11.150]  Yeah. Just to see.
[03:11.630 --> 03:12.730]  So a lot of times.
[03:12.810 --> 03:17.230]  So this has like 10 packs, but you're like, there's like a ton of cards per pack.
[03:17.270 --> 03:18.390]  Is that sort of like? Yeah.
[03:18.430 --> 03:20.270]  There are 40 cards per pack. That's crazy.
[03:20.670 --> 03:21.590]  Is that kind of like how these are?
[03:22.270 --> 03:23.850]  There's 36 cards in that. This is 36.
[03:23.850 --> 03:24.870]  Wow. Yeah.
[03:24.990 --> 03:28.930]  So these are the expensive two right here that you can only get through hobby shops.
[03:29.430 --> 03:32.490]  And then all this other stuff is technically available at a store.
[03:32.590 --> 03:36.470]  So you bought everything that you could possibly buy for the Tops Baseball 2024?
[03:36.790 --> 03:37.410]  To my knowledge.
[03:37.630 --> 03:40.870]  I don't think there's any other kind of box or pack you can buy.
[03:40.970 --> 03:42.510]  OK. To my knowledge. I might be wrong.
[03:42.610 --> 03:45.150]  So that's not to say we're going to get every card in the collection.
[03:45.310 --> 03:49.770]  It's that we were trying our chances on a lot of this stuff.
[03:49.870 --> 03:52.370]  And now you can see the difference in what you could be buying.
[03:52.370 --> 03:55.350]  I thought this would be a kind of a fun thing where we can go through it together.
[03:56.090 --> 03:58.210]  We're not going to open it all today, but maybe we'll get, you know,
[03:58.250 --> 03:59.290]  take a couple of weeks.
[03:59.470 --> 04:00.930]  We could try, but that's a lot of packs.
[04:01.130 --> 04:03.490]  But I would love to, when it's all said and done, say like, OK,
[04:03.490 --> 04:05.330]  we paid eight bucks for this hanger pack.
[04:05.430 --> 04:06.750]  This is how much money we got out of it.
[04:07.030 --> 04:08.310]  You paid 350 bucks.
[04:08.590 --> 04:09.590]  This is how much we got out of it.
[04:09.870 --> 04:12.370]  You paid whatever in this and determine
[04:14.730 --> 04:15.990]  ourselves to the best of our ability.
[04:16.130 --> 04:18.290]  What is the best bang for your buck? Oh, nice. I like that.
[04:18.450 --> 04:19.190]  I think that's really cool.
[04:19.690 --> 04:24.370]  Teach your people what you can buy and maybe you shouldn't spend $350 on.
[04:24.990 --> 04:27.790]  This one has holiday stuff.
[04:28.470 --> 04:30.830]  Look for eggs, rabbit, flowers, umbrella.
[04:31.390 --> 04:32.450]  I've never seen that.
[04:32.550 --> 04:34.270]  Oh, I can. Yeah, we've seen it.
[04:34.290 --> 04:35.450]  I feel like we've seen it once.
[04:35.630 --> 04:37.630]  We've seen it like once before. It is very weird.
[04:37.950 --> 04:40.810]  So every year they have different parallels, different inserts,
[04:41.050 --> 04:41.970]  different fun things to chase.
[04:42.090 --> 04:46.030]  And each one of these packs or boxes will probably have a different chase.
[04:46.210 --> 04:48.570]  Will these have that thing that we learned about
[04:48.570 --> 04:51.790]  where the one of one base card?
[04:52.230 --> 04:54.270]  So they did this thing this year with tops.
[04:54.350 --> 04:55.910]  And I'm excited to go through it because of this.
[04:56.350 --> 04:58.170]  Where I think it's a great idea.
[04:58.990 --> 05:00.590]  Fanatics is getting a lot of shit right now.
[05:00.690 --> 05:02.390]  Yeah. Fanatics owns tops. They've taken over.
[05:02.470 --> 05:05.150]  They're getting a lot of shit for showing baseball players wieners.
[05:05.290 --> 05:07.250]  Hey, I'm all for it.
[05:07.330 --> 05:09.110]  I know Emily's all in. Those jerseys look fucking terrible, man.
[05:09.110 --> 05:10.830]  They are. It's just nipples and wieners all day long.
[05:11.930 --> 05:16.550]  But they they've been attempting to do some cool stuff in collectibles.
[05:16.550 --> 05:18.230]  This one kind of went awry.
[05:18.470 --> 05:24.170]  They had this idea where they were going to mark the first card of every
[05:24.630 --> 05:27.410]  like the first card, first individual card of each.
[05:27.490 --> 05:30.490]  Oh, wow. So like, oh, I kind of did the very first one of the Kuna.
[05:30.590 --> 05:31.490]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:31.490 --> 05:32.590]  They'd make it a one of one.
[05:32.750 --> 05:36.030]  They were going to put this big thing on it that says first print.
[05:36.070 --> 05:36.450]  Yeah. Right.
[05:36.830 --> 05:38.170]  And there's nothing different about the card.
[05:38.230 --> 05:39.650]  It's not laminated. It's the first one.
[05:40.190 --> 05:41.330]  And they made those.
[05:41.570 --> 05:45.490]  But they forgot to put the first print symbol on the front.
[05:45.490 --> 05:48.890]  So people are just getting base cards that say one of one on the back
[05:48.890 --> 05:50.030]  and they don't know what to do with them
[05:50.750 --> 05:52.730]  because they completely drop the ball on it.
[05:52.750 --> 05:56.310]  So and most people don't think to look at the back of their regular space card.
[05:56.410 --> 05:57.770]  So there's probably hundreds out there.
[05:58.010 --> 05:59.910]  Well, there can only be a couple of hundred, right?
[05:59.910 --> 06:01.330]  Because only 400 cards in the set or whatever.
[06:01.510 --> 06:04.870]  But there's most of them will probably never be seen when it's nobody.
[06:05.530 --> 06:07.590]  When it's everybody's job, it's nobody's job.
[06:08.410 --> 06:10.290]  When somebody goes, dude, isn't this a cool idea?
[06:10.330 --> 06:11.730]  And then no one's in charge of it.
[06:11.730 --> 06:15.410]  You get one of one on the back of some Ronald Jr. cards.
[06:15.530 --> 06:16.430]  Yeah, they're just base.
[06:16.790 --> 06:19.470]  So then you once you open and then you flip it over and just check.
[06:19.550 --> 06:21.230]  I have to do an extra check on the back.
[06:21.590 --> 06:22.550]  That sucks.
[06:22.770 --> 06:23.510]  It's kind of annoying.
[06:24.490 --> 06:25.790]  But what did we get last time?
[06:25.850 --> 06:27.850]  And then all this other stuff that we have that we're before we get to that.
[06:27.890 --> 06:30.250]  You know, I was going to say we have this old Topps magazine
[06:30.250 --> 06:32.110]  that somebody sent into us from 1992.
[06:32.570 --> 06:34.850]  I loved I think we all loved Martin Maguire back then.
[06:35.950 --> 06:37.510]  And I never opened it up yet.
[06:37.550 --> 06:39.670]  And then I just opened it up today and realized there's cards in it.
[06:39.670 --> 06:42.270]  Speaking of that, there's my Larry Bird rookie that I upgraded.
[06:43.150 --> 06:48.270]  We got Mike Messina, Barry Larkin, Juan Gonzalez,
[06:48.410 --> 06:50.150]  who we have an auto baseball club.
[06:50.510 --> 06:51.870]  And then Dion, Neon Dion.
[06:52.890 --> 06:54.690]  Neon Dion, he had so many nicknames.
[06:54.970 --> 06:55.830]  Yeah, primetime, baby.
[06:56.390 --> 07:00.690]  Roberto Alomar, Fred the Crime Dog McGriff, Doug Drabeck and George Brett.
[07:01.030 --> 07:01.910]  Cool. That's cool.
[07:02.170 --> 07:02.830]  Love you, Crime Dog.
[07:03.010 --> 07:04.250]  Boys of Summer, Books of Summer.
[07:04.610 --> 07:05.730]  All right. So let's set that aside.
[07:05.810 --> 07:06.190]  I thought that was awesome.
[07:06.430 --> 07:07.270]  OK, what's next?
[07:07.270 --> 07:10.330]  What's next is last week we opened up or two weeks ago.
[07:10.490 --> 07:11.810]  We opened up a bunch of stuff.
[07:11.990 --> 07:13.750]  There wasn't really anything interesting to talk about,
[07:13.890 --> 07:16.150]  but I did think this one would be worth revisiting.
[07:16.270 --> 07:19.810]  OK, if you remember, we opened up a blind video game box.
[07:19.810 --> 07:21.170]  Oh, that's right. Yeah. NES box.
[07:21.250 --> 07:22.010]  And we got Mega Man.
[07:22.150 --> 07:23.290]  That wasn't graded, though.
[07:23.290 --> 07:25.070]  It's not graded or anything, but I looked it up.
[07:25.130 --> 07:26.350]  It sells for about 100 bucks.
[07:27.130 --> 07:28.050]  Mega Man? Yeah.
[07:28.150 --> 07:31.610]  Eighty to one hundred dollars in this exact condition.
[07:31.710 --> 07:35.250]  Really? Without if it had if it was graded,
[07:35.250 --> 07:37.850]  if it had the it was unopened, it had the box.
[07:37.970 --> 07:39.790]  It'd be like multiple thousands.
[07:40.030 --> 07:44.050]  I have a friend who runs all the social for a thing called Cheap Ass Gamer.
[07:44.150 --> 07:45.950]  It's all like that. That stuff from my friend Jared.
[07:46.230 --> 07:49.650]  And he does that. He collects games like in box, like
[07:49.650 --> 07:52.710]  and he tells me about the difference in like this one has packaging.
[07:52.810 --> 07:54.110]  This one has the instruction booklet.
[07:54.290 --> 07:55.390]  This one doesn't have any of that stuff.
[07:55.390 --> 07:58.110]  And like the amount varies wildly.
[07:58.170 --> 08:01.090]  And people collecting that stuff, dude, that is so fucking crazy.
[08:01.210 --> 08:02.270]  Yeah, that's wild.
[08:02.270 --> 08:06.370]  If you have look at your old physical media, just take a look at it.
[08:06.530 --> 08:08.550]  Physical media is taken off as a collectible.
[08:08.650 --> 08:10.870]  And it's only going to become more sought after, I think,
[08:11.030 --> 08:13.470]  as we get further and further away from the need for it.
[08:13.510 --> 08:16.290]  I have a I think a retail copy with instruction book
[08:16.290 --> 08:19.370]  and everything of Marvel versus Capcom 2 for PlayStation 2.
[08:19.610 --> 08:21.030]  And that's apparently worth pretty good money.
[08:21.230 --> 08:23.910]  What happened? You got which one's this?
[08:23.930 --> 08:25.370]  It's the monster. It's Suli.
[08:25.650 --> 08:27.130]  Suli. I've never seen monsters.
[08:27.390 --> 08:29.290]  Really? Here you go.
[08:29.370 --> 08:29.930]  That's for you.
[08:30.370 --> 08:31.470]  But they work at a business.
[08:31.470 --> 08:32.330]  They're incorporated.
[08:32.450 --> 08:34.010]  I know. Oh, that movie's good.
[08:34.070 --> 08:34.930]  We should watch it. Sure.
[08:35.650 --> 08:36.490]  Sully's a cool one.
[08:36.690 --> 08:38.790]  That's John Goodman, right? He's a cutie cuff.
[08:38.830 --> 08:40.710]  Yeah, let's see.
[08:41.910 --> 08:42.850]  Gracie, Monsters, Inc.
[08:44.750 --> 08:45.770]  What? Oh, love.
[08:45.850 --> 08:46.770]  I thought you said no.
[08:46.950 --> 08:48.370]  And I'm like, whoa, all right.
[08:48.570 --> 08:50.330]  Fingers crossed we get him later.
[08:50.330 --> 08:52.390]  Demo Emery, Demo Emery, Demo Emery.
[08:52.450 --> 08:54.170]  Ah, it's Rafiki.
[08:55.490 --> 08:57.230]  You're getting close to having your whole set, though.
[08:57.710 --> 08:58.730]  Yeah. Except for the one you want.
[08:58.950 --> 08:59.310]  I know.
[08:59.870 --> 09:01.110]  Well, maybe next week.
[09:01.110 --> 09:02.930]  These are what you got me for Valentine's Day.
[09:03.390 --> 09:05.330]  Yeah, she held on to them, though, but I'm here.
[09:05.950 --> 09:07.730]  That's fun. I bought her more than...
[09:07.730 --> 09:09.950]  If you say so, I don't...
[09:09.950 --> 09:10.890]  I bought her other things, too.
[09:10.890 --> 09:11.250]  That's fine.
[09:11.990 --> 09:13.370]  Okay, let's go through some mail.
[09:13.530 --> 09:13.850]  Let's see what we got.
[09:13.910 --> 09:15.010]  You're not gonna show your other things?
[09:15.190 --> 09:15.970]  Oh, yeah, sorry.
[09:16.650 --> 09:18.650]  So in my personal life, I still open cards, right?
[09:18.670 --> 09:19.490]  I don't do it all on here.
[09:19.590 --> 09:20.150]  It's true, I've seen it.
[09:20.910 --> 09:22.390]  And I got a couple of interesting things.
[09:22.490 --> 09:23.330]  First off, I wanted to show,
[09:23.410 --> 09:24.630]  we're not gonna open them up this week,
[09:26.070 --> 09:28.290]  but you remember last year when we had the Monopoly cards?
[09:28.310 --> 09:29.070]  Yeah. The Prison Monopoly
[09:29.070 --> 09:29.710]  I was excited about?
[09:29.790 --> 09:30.410]  They came out again.
[09:30.410 --> 09:35.330]  So I was able to get a couple of boxes off of Target.com.
[09:35.670 --> 09:36.770]  I opened two at home.
[09:36.830 --> 09:37.770]  I have three here for us.
[09:37.790 --> 09:38.510]  I opened two at home,
[09:38.650 --> 09:42.670]  and I got this sweet Jason Tatum Purple Wave Parallel.
[09:42.690 --> 09:43.370]  But I just wanted to show you,
[09:43.450 --> 09:44.810]  they're pretty cool-looking cards this year,
[09:44.890 --> 09:46.470]  so we'll get into them.
[09:46.990 --> 09:48.730]  The Wimby Rookie would be insane.
[09:49.190 --> 09:52.150]  Speaking of insane, I've been opening up
[09:52.150 --> 09:54.430]  some Prism NBA at my house,
[09:54.630 --> 09:56.170]  and I pulled this guy,
[09:56.290 --> 09:58.690]  which is a Green Prism Wimby Rookie.
[09:58.870 --> 09:59.310]  Jesus!
[09:59.310 --> 10:05.150]  This guy, Raw, is going for about $200 to $250.
[10:06.850 --> 10:08.770]  Which is pretty good,
[10:09.210 --> 10:12.570]  but pales in comparison to this motherfucker I pulled,
[10:12.950 --> 10:16.150]  which is a Silver Prism Victor Wiminyama Raw,
[10:16.570 --> 10:18.650]  which is going for about $900.
[10:19.070 --> 10:19.430]  Whoa!
[10:21.450 --> 10:24.610]  Every single sale has gone for between $800 and $900,
[10:24.830 --> 10:25.810]  and there have been a lot of sales.
[10:26.230 --> 10:28.170]  So I don't know that that'll maintain,
[10:28.170 --> 10:31.030]  but what we're gonna do is send this off tomorrow
[10:31.030 --> 10:31.790]  to get graded.
[10:31.850 --> 10:32.510]  Are you gonna get it graded?
[10:32.530 --> 10:33.450]  I'm gonna try to sell this card,
[10:33.470 --> 10:35.390]  because graded, it's going for about $3,000.
[10:36.530 --> 10:40.890]  So what a savvy collector will do in a situation like this
[10:40.890 --> 10:42.790]  is if they get the card early,
[10:43.090 --> 10:45.450]  they'll get it out the door during the hype.
[10:45.910 --> 10:47.830]  His card will tank at some point.
[10:48.070 --> 10:50.670]  He'll have an injury or a bad season.
[10:51.110 --> 10:51.710]  It'll go back down.
[10:51.830 --> 10:55.010]  Maybe the graded PSA 10 is $3,000 now.
[10:55.090 --> 10:57.570]  Maybe it goes down to $2,500, $2,200,
[10:57.570 --> 10:59.370]  and then you re-buy it back later,
[10:59.470 --> 11:01.270]  because this will maintain a tremendous amount of value
[11:01.550 --> 11:03.550]  if he stays healthy for most of his career.
[11:03.570 --> 11:06.350]  But the point is to send it now, to get it graded now.
[11:06.430 --> 11:08.030]  So if you were gonna sell it, you would sell it now.
[11:08.110 --> 11:09.810]  Yeah, I'll rush delivery, do the whole thing,
[11:09.890 --> 11:10.750]  get it out the door fast.
[11:10.910 --> 11:12.470]  What a cool-ass pull.
[11:12.770 --> 11:13.210]  That's a good one, man.
[11:13.210 --> 11:14.010]  That's an insane pull.
[11:14.230 --> 11:15.250]  So almost $1,000 worth.
[11:15.250 --> 11:15.970]  Imagine if it was on the show.
[11:16.410 --> 11:16.930]  One of the...
[11:16.930 --> 11:17.350]  Sorry.
[11:18.730 --> 11:19.170]  That's okay.
[11:19.270 --> 11:20.050]  We have some mail to get to.
[11:20.050 --> 11:21.670]  We have some mail to get to.
[11:21.730 --> 11:23.410]  I realized I forgot the pack sack again.
[11:23.510 --> 11:24.350]  I know where he is.
[11:24.390 --> 11:24.870]  That's okay.
[11:24.990 --> 11:25.870]  Story of my life, huh?
[11:25.970 --> 11:26.190]  Yeah.
[11:27.530 --> 11:29.810]  This letter is written to you
[11:29.810 --> 11:31.910]  on the back of a Red Baron box.
[11:31.910 --> 11:32.970]  Oh my God.
[11:33.210 --> 11:36.250]  Are you garbage if you send a letter on a pizza box?
[11:36.490 --> 11:37.050]  That's a yes.
[11:37.450 --> 11:40.150]  Hello, Geoff, Emily, Eric, and the Break Show crew,
[11:40.290 --> 11:41.010]  also Andrew and Gavin.
[11:41.770 --> 11:43.610]  I've been watching RT for so long,
[11:43.670 --> 11:47.530]  but Fuckface has reignited my love for you guys.
[11:47.650 --> 11:49.750]  The Break Show is a beacon of joy each week,
[11:49.790 --> 11:51.730]  and I love all the wacky cards you open.
[11:52.010 --> 11:53.890]  Here's a bunch of random packs I found
[11:53.890 --> 11:55.350]  at a store in Halloweentown.
[11:55.350 --> 11:56.390]  Maybe they're haunted.
[11:57.170 --> 11:58.910]  Anyways, best of luck and congratulations
[11:58.910 --> 12:00.950]  on getting married, just you and I,
[12:01.090 --> 12:03.390]  and not dying, Eric, congratulations.
[12:03.630 --> 12:03.850]  Come on.
[12:04.550 --> 12:05.590]  Sincerely, Daniel from Morgan.
[12:05.870 --> 12:07.070]  Come on, it was one curse.
[12:07.250 --> 12:08.730]  It was one simple curse.
[12:09.110 --> 12:10.890]  They got a little green army man, which is awesome.
[12:11.110 --> 12:12.170]  So you got some cool cards.
[12:12.490 --> 12:13.650]  There are a few in here.
[12:13.990 --> 12:15.250]  I think feed most of them to the pack sack.
[12:15.410 --> 12:16.030]  I think that one's cool.
[12:16.030 --> 12:17.670]  Nightmare for Christmas, dino cards.
[12:17.670 --> 12:19.230]  Yeah, I think this next one is one
[12:19.230 --> 12:20.090]  that you'll probably want to open.
[12:20.230 --> 12:20.830]  Mega Man stand.
[12:20.830 --> 12:21.910]  Yeah, that feels like one you want to open.
[12:22.990 --> 12:26.270]  Antique cars of Panini, Eclipse, San Diego Zoo.
[12:26.790 --> 12:28.030]  That's a cool one.
[12:29.590 --> 12:30.550]  Madagascar, Independence Day.
[12:30.630 --> 12:31.570]  I didn't even know they had cards.
[12:34.990 --> 12:36.070]  And MM2 cards?
[12:36.150 --> 12:36.750]  That's Marilyn Monroe.
[12:36.910 --> 12:38.470]  Wait, no, what's that name?
[12:39.370 --> 12:40.010]  Marilyn Monroe.
[12:40.290 --> 12:41.170]  Oh yeah, Marilyn Monroe cards.
[12:41.210 --> 12:41.530]  Neat.
[12:42.370 --> 12:43.570]  Well, we'll feed the pack sack with some of them.
[12:43.610 --> 12:44.090]  What do you want to open?
[12:44.290 --> 12:44.950]  Let's open up these two.
[12:45.010 --> 12:46.870]  American Man stand and dinosaurs right now.
[12:46.990 --> 12:49.910]  And then we'll throw those in the pack sack.
[12:50.250 --> 12:51.010]  This is a different pack sack,
[12:51.010 --> 12:51.710]  but I think it's trash.
[12:51.910 --> 12:52.650]  Yeah, it's a trash sack.
[12:52.730 --> 12:52.910]  What?
[12:53.550 --> 12:53.790]  Yeah.
[12:54.170 --> 12:54.850]  Okay, what do we got?
[12:54.930 --> 12:56.930]  We got, ooh, Hong Kong show.
[12:57.810 --> 12:58.170]  Okay.
[12:58.730 --> 12:59.090]  What?
[12:59.610 --> 13:01.050]  Oh, I'm going to hold off on that one
[13:01.050 --> 13:02.430]  because Emily loves them.
[13:02.650 --> 13:03.490]  Ooh, that's cool.
[13:04.690 --> 13:05.890]  Here's Brian Highland.
[13:05.910 --> 13:07.350]  I don't know who Brian Highland is, do y'all?
[13:07.430 --> 13:07.850]  What do you think?
[13:07.910 --> 13:08.170]  Mike.
[13:15.110 --> 13:16.750]  He recorded 22 charts.
[13:16.970 --> 13:17.950]  I guess he's just a solo dude.
[13:18.290 --> 13:20.890]  Oh, he wrote Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny
[13:20.890 --> 13:22.150]  Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.
[13:22.330 --> 13:23.350]  Or at least he recorded it.
[13:23.450 --> 13:23.910]  Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny.
[13:24.030 --> 13:26.390]  I mean, that's, Mike's like screaming it in there, so.
[13:26.450 --> 13:26.690]  Yeah, he is.
[13:27.330 --> 13:28.530]  Mary Wells.
[13:29.170 --> 13:30.510]  Ooh, Johnny Rivers.
[13:31.550 --> 13:33.510]  The Sign Off Salute.
[13:35.810 --> 13:36.610]  Bill Doggett.
[13:36.790 --> 13:36.930]  Okay.
[13:37.490 --> 13:38.850]  The Special Offer.
[13:39.090 --> 13:39.490]  Nice.
[13:39.690 --> 13:40.050]  Nice.
[13:40.210 --> 13:40.970]  Classic Series One.
[13:41.010 --> 13:41.710]  We got a bunch of those.
[13:41.890 --> 13:44.490]  And then, Emily's favorite band.
[13:45.310 --> 13:46.110]  Sex Symbol.
[13:46.290 --> 13:46.490]  Yeah.
[13:46.710 --> 13:47.570]  We'll see why in a second.
[13:47.590 --> 13:47.810]  Okay.
[13:47.990 --> 13:48.670]  Loves them to death.
[13:48.670 --> 13:49.030]  Let's see.
[13:49.030 --> 13:49.930]  Mick Fleetwood.
[13:50.470 --> 13:50.890]  Yeah!
[13:53.520 --> 13:54.120]  Let's look.
[13:54.220 --> 13:54.880]  There you go.
[13:55.360 --> 13:55.380]  Yay!
[13:55.740 --> 13:58.120]  That's a sup if I've ever seen one.
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.980]  He looks like the guy from...
[14:02.980 --> 14:03.480]  Fleetwood Mac?
[14:05.720 --> 14:06.140]  Man.
[14:06.260 --> 14:07.640]  He looks like a really talented musician.
[14:08.080 --> 14:10.400]  He looks like the butler from Rocky Horror Picture Show.
[14:10.480 --> 14:10.900]  Yes!
[14:11.140 --> 14:11.820]  Yes, he does.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.020]  Time is fleeting.
[14:13.620 --> 14:14.180]  That's a great call.
[14:14.700 --> 14:16.100]  Will you open this one for me?
[14:16.160 --> 14:16.580]  Dino cards.
[14:16.660 --> 14:17.740]  Oh, you wanna open the Marilyn Monroe?
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.420]  Yeah, I'll open it after the dino cards.
[14:19.420 --> 14:21.040]  This says it might have gold in it.
[14:21.120 --> 14:24.100]  Oh, she didn't even care about the dinosaurs.
[14:24.320 --> 14:25.000]  And we wouldn't...
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.880]  She didn't even care about the Comptosaurus?
[14:28.160 --> 14:29.240]  He's from the late Jurassic.
[14:29.340 --> 14:30.980]  He's 145 million years old.
[14:31.260 --> 14:33.120]  He doesn't look a day over 135 million.
[14:33.140 --> 14:35.080]  We saw that TikTok of the dinosaurs running.
[14:35.600 --> 14:36.040]  Oh, yeah.
[14:36.040 --> 14:36.660]  Which ones are faster.
[14:36.840 --> 14:36.980]  That's cool.
[14:37.080 --> 14:37.440]  That's crazy.
[14:37.800 --> 14:38.880]  Some of them dinosaurs are fast.
[14:39.080 --> 14:39.980]  Doesn't it look like he has hands?
[14:40.500 --> 14:40.860]  Iguanodon.
[14:41.240 --> 14:42.500]  It does look like he has hands.
[14:42.880 --> 14:43.980]  But they're like little mittens.
[14:44.220 --> 14:44.320]  Yeah.
[14:46.360 --> 14:46.720]  Leptoceratops.
[14:47.080 --> 14:47.440]  Wow.
[14:47.440 --> 14:49.640]  We got Lesothosaurus.
[14:49.940 --> 14:50.380]  That's you.
[14:53.080 --> 14:53.720]  That's Eric.
[14:53.960 --> 14:54.580]  That's Emily.
[14:54.820 --> 14:55.900]  That's Emily.
[14:58.640 --> 14:59.280]  Saltosaurus.
[14:59.660 --> 15:00.080]  That's me.
[15:02.220 --> 15:02.860]  Sauropelta.
[15:03.200 --> 15:04.720]  That's a cool one.
[15:05.660 --> 15:06.300]  Megalosaurus.
[15:06.700 --> 15:07.340]  Oh, wow.
[15:07.480 --> 15:08.120]  He's...
[15:08.120 --> 15:09.060]  Whoa, look at him.
[15:12.720 --> 15:13.360]  Euplocephalus.
[15:13.480 --> 15:15.160]  That's Eric and Gavin.
[15:15.260 --> 15:15.660]  That's really...
[15:15.660 --> 15:16.200]  Yeah, definitely.
[15:16.200 --> 15:17.260]  That's how we hang out.
[15:17.380 --> 15:17.580]  Yeah.
[15:18.100 --> 15:20.200]  And then, Chasmosaurus.
[15:20.740 --> 15:21.100]  Chasmosaurus.
[15:21.320 --> 15:21.380]  Yeah.
[15:21.660 --> 15:22.700]  That's Andrew.
[15:22.780 --> 15:25.020]  You have to think about how far apart
[15:25.020 --> 15:27.120]  all these dinosaurs were in like time, too.
[15:27.300 --> 15:28.520]  Where it's like 145 million.
[15:28.800 --> 15:29.940]  Oh, only 120 million.
[15:30.040 --> 15:31.680]  And it's like, there's 25 million years.
[15:31.820 --> 15:32.880]  Yeah, they didn't know each other.
[15:32.880 --> 15:34.080]  No, no, not at all.
[15:34.140 --> 15:35.800]  A lot of these dudes weren't friends or enemies.
[15:35.980 --> 15:36.140]  Yeah.
[15:36.240 --> 15:37.440]  Do girls have favorite dinosaurs?
[15:38.560 --> 15:40.880]  I usually, I would say that my main one
[15:40.880 --> 15:42.180]  would be the Triceratops.
[15:42.200 --> 15:44.600]  It's pretty tight, but I love a good, like, long neck.
[15:44.660 --> 15:45.140]  Now, okay.
[15:45.140 --> 15:46.200]  So, yeah.
[15:46.420 --> 15:49.340]  So the answer for her is she likes Land Before Time.
[15:49.340 --> 15:49.480]  Yeah.
[15:49.860 --> 15:50.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:50.700 --> 15:52.760]  Pretty much anybody in Land Before Time.
[15:52.860 --> 15:52.940]  Yeah.
[15:53.140 --> 15:54.260]  The correct answer is Stegosaurus.
[15:54.680 --> 15:56.420]  Stegosaurus is the best dinosaur.
[15:56.640 --> 15:58.960]  He was so cute in Land Before Time, though.
[15:59.420 --> 15:59.720]  Let's see.
[16:00.460 --> 16:01.820]  Let's see what's up with Marilyn Monroe.
[16:01.920 --> 16:02.460]  What's she up to?
[16:03.380 --> 16:04.980]  She is in a bathing suit.
[16:05.080 --> 16:05.280]  Yeah.
[16:05.440 --> 16:05.860]  At the beach.
[16:05.880 --> 16:06.500]  That looks like gold.
[16:06.780 --> 16:07.560]  That looks like a painting.
[16:07.560 --> 16:08.500]  That looks like a painting in the background.
[16:08.600 --> 16:10.300]  Oh, no, that's, I bet that's Acapulco.
[16:10.960 --> 16:12.960]  Here she is at the pyramids.
[16:13.720 --> 16:17.080]  Oh, here's a great picture of her at the Eiffel Tower.
[16:18.000 --> 16:18.860]  She's smiling.
[16:19.120 --> 16:19.760]  She's probably at a restaurant.
[16:19.980 --> 16:20.500]  Aw, cutie.
[16:20.700 --> 16:21.640]  Oh, goodness.
[16:22.220 --> 16:22.940]  She forgot her shirt.
[16:23.140 --> 16:23.640]  Uh-oh!
[16:25.400 --> 16:27.960]  Can we show that on roosterteeth.com, roosterteeth.com app?
[16:28.240 --> 16:29.800]  Here she is at a windmill.
[16:30.040 --> 16:32.060]  That looks like Amsterdam, huh?
[16:32.460 --> 16:33.240]  Yeah, that does.
[16:33.300 --> 16:34.620]  That's probably Amsterdam or Holland.
[16:34.740 --> 16:36.220]  Here she is with a pair of soles.
[16:36.300 --> 16:37.000]  Oh, cutie.
[16:37.240 --> 16:39.100]  Oh, here's business Monroe.
[16:39.500 --> 16:39.600]  Busy business woman.
[16:39.600 --> 16:40.700]  She's at the steps of a courthouse.
[16:40.820 --> 16:41.440]  She's probably just...
[16:41.440 --> 16:42.180]  Yeah, she's doing law.
[16:42.180 --> 16:43.980]  Oh, and then we got this.
[16:45.120 --> 16:47.180]  Sort of a silver prism.
[16:47.540 --> 16:47.640]  Ooh.
[16:47.940 --> 16:48.400]  That's cool.
[16:48.600 --> 16:52.000]  Marilyn Monroe, silver wave prism, auto on card.
[16:52.140 --> 16:53.000]  What is it on the back?
[16:53.060 --> 16:54.880]  She's doing the, get my, my darlin'.
[16:55.520 --> 16:56.800]  Follow my rock time gal.
[16:57.120 --> 16:58.860]  She's being Michigan J. Frog.
[16:59.160 --> 17:00.180]  Yeah, she's Michigan J. Frog.
[17:01.200 --> 17:02.760]  Okay, we'll put these away.
[17:02.860 --> 17:04.520]  Then we'll open up this box.
[17:05.500 --> 17:06.860]  This mail is very interesting
[17:06.860 --> 17:08.200]  and I wanted you to open it second.
[17:09.720 --> 17:10.920]  Hello, Geoff.
[17:10.920 --> 17:12.460]  Thanks for everything you guys do.
[17:12.920 --> 17:14.680]  Thank you for watching and listening.
[17:15.020 --> 17:17.120]  I've been a fan since the early days of A.H.
[17:17.380 --> 17:18.320]  That one's dead.
[17:18.780 --> 17:21.640]  But only recently discovered Face.
[17:21.920 --> 17:22.020]  Great.
[17:22.120 --> 17:23.900]  And haven't been able to stop listening since.
[17:24.000 --> 17:24.620]  Thank you so much.
[17:24.780 --> 17:25.120]  This is great.
[17:25.500 --> 17:26.900]  This led me to The Break Show
[17:26.900 --> 17:28.760]  and sparked an interest in collecting and opening cards.
[17:28.880 --> 17:29.800]  After all you've given to us,
[17:29.840 --> 17:31.260]  I figured I would give something for you to return.
[17:31.340 --> 17:32.980]  Here are a few Marcus Smart cards I collected.
[17:33.340 --> 17:35.220]  Hope you don't find any of these in your collection already.
[17:35.460 --> 17:36.720]  Regulation listener, Brandon.
[17:37.300 --> 17:38.100]  Oh, Brandon.
[17:38.560 --> 17:39.160]  Check it out.
[17:39.760 --> 17:40.340]  Marcus Smart.
[17:40.340 --> 17:42.160]  There's a reason I wanted you to check these out.
[17:48.750 --> 17:49.830]  You got it.
[17:49.830 --> 17:50.370]  You're in there, bud.
[17:50.550 --> 17:50.970]  You're in there.
[17:51.170 --> 17:51.610]  Are you shaking?
[17:52.070 --> 17:52.690]  Falling apart.
[17:52.890 --> 17:53.110]  Whoa.
[17:53.670 --> 17:54.250]  Oh, dang.
[17:54.250 --> 17:54.930]  Oh, shit.
[17:55.250 --> 17:56.190]  Yeah, I don't have this.
[17:56.210 --> 17:57.670]  So this is PSA graded.
[17:57.790 --> 17:58.150]  Wow.
[17:58.450 --> 18:00.990]  This is a PSA 9, 2022 Crown Royal.
[18:01.450 --> 18:02.170]  Crystal Gold.
[18:02.270 --> 18:03.170]  This is numbered to 10.
[18:03.210 --> 18:03.970]  Yep, you wanna set it down flat
[18:03.970 --> 18:04.870]  so the camera can see it.
[18:04.890 --> 18:05.710]  This is number four of 10.
[18:06.590 --> 18:06.710]  Yeah.
[18:06.790 --> 18:08.510]  Holy shit, that's a huge hit.
[18:08.670 --> 18:08.770]  Yeah.
[18:09.450 --> 18:10.170]  These are...
[18:10.170 --> 18:11.130]  So Brandon...
[18:11.130 --> 18:12.630]  I don't know Brandon's collection,
[18:12.790 --> 18:14.510]  but it's pretty fucking wild.
[18:14.530 --> 18:15.870]  Oh my God.
[18:17.090 --> 18:18.990]  We gotta send Brandon a care package.
[18:19.070 --> 18:20.790]  A very expensive care package.
[18:20.910 --> 18:21.570]  Brandon sent me...
[18:21.570 --> 18:24.010]  This is a Macula Marcus Smart.
[18:24.830 --> 18:26.610]  One of three auto.
[18:27.170 --> 18:28.230]  It's a patch auto.
[18:28.490 --> 18:28.710]  Wow.
[18:29.010 --> 18:31.290]  So that...
[18:32.790 --> 18:34.310]  Oh my God.
[18:34.370 --> 18:35.190]  Don't know what to say about that.
[18:35.190 --> 18:37.710]  That is instantly one of the best Marcus Smart cards I have.
[18:37.710 --> 18:39.230]  But I've got some more ones.
[18:40.390 --> 18:42.610]  Do you think it's the S on the Celtics?
[18:43.250 --> 18:44.370]  Because it goes back up?
[18:44.890 --> 18:45.670]  Might be.
[18:47.290 --> 18:48.670]  I think it's the C,
[18:48.790 --> 18:49.730]  but it's upside down and backwards.
[18:49.970 --> 18:50.470]  You think so?
[18:50.690 --> 18:51.830]  This is 2022, 2023,
[18:52.130 --> 18:53.210]  so this is last year's Immaculate.
[18:53.250 --> 18:54.130]  Yeah, they put it in backwards.
[18:54.390 --> 18:55.110]  I mean...
[18:55.110 --> 18:55.910]  Yeah, it's all messed up.
[18:57.390 --> 18:58.190]  That's insane.
[18:58.690 --> 18:59.430]  Oh my gosh.
[18:59.450 --> 19:00.050]  I'm a little overwhelmed.
[19:00.290 --> 19:01.730]  Yeah, I thought that might happen.
[19:02.010 --> 19:02.450]  Oh, fuck.
[19:02.470 --> 19:03.270]  So check this out.
[19:03.410 --> 19:04.310]  All right, well...
[19:04.310 --> 19:05.730]  Oh my God!
[19:07.950 --> 19:08.750]  Brandon's crazy.
[19:08.750 --> 19:11.830]  Brandon's going to make me cry on the TV.
[19:13.830 --> 19:17.370]  This is Panini Lux.
[19:17.490 --> 19:23.270]  This is a patch rookie card numbered to 25.
[19:24.150 --> 19:28.150]  This is instantly among the rarest rookie cards I have.
[19:28.370 --> 19:29.150]  And I have a lot.
[19:29.350 --> 19:29.950]  I have thousands.
[19:31.030 --> 19:32.570]  Not thousands of rookie cards, I have hundreds,
[19:32.730 --> 19:33.350]  but I have thousands of them.
[19:34.350 --> 19:34.830]  Dang.
[19:35.450 --> 19:35.850]  Thank you.
[19:35.850 --> 19:35.870]  Wow.
[19:37.410 --> 19:38.170]  Get Brandon.
[19:39.570 --> 19:40.330]  Brandon's really...
[19:40.730 --> 19:42.610]  Let's see what the fucking...
[19:43.410 --> 19:43.970]  Oh, no.
[19:44.170 --> 19:45.510]  Oh my God.
[19:45.830 --> 19:46.770]  Then another...
[19:46.770 --> 19:50.870]  So this is a two-patch RPA.
[19:51.470 --> 19:52.390]  Oh my gosh.
[19:52.410 --> 19:53.770]  So this is...
[19:54.950 --> 19:56.070]  This is a rookie...
[19:56.070 --> 19:56.550]  What is it?
[19:56.550 --> 19:57.510]  Rookie Rampage, I think.
[19:57.970 --> 19:59.330]  Yeah, it's Panini Excalibur.
[19:59.530 --> 20:00.810]  It's one of their higher...
[20:00.810 --> 20:01.550]  I don't know if they still make them,
[20:01.610 --> 20:03.890]  but it was one of their higher-end Panini sets
[20:03.890 --> 20:06.090]  in that era, 2015, 2016.
[20:06.930 --> 20:09.070]  As you can see here, we have...
[20:09.070 --> 20:11.210]  It's numbered 194 of 349.
[20:11.310 --> 20:11.970]  This is a rookie.
[20:12.770 --> 20:13.950]  This is a sticker auto.
[20:14.450 --> 20:16.810]  And then the patch here, we have a part of his jersey,
[20:16.930 --> 20:19.310]  clearly, and then we have a part of a basketball.
[20:19.410 --> 20:19.710]  Yes.
[20:19.810 --> 20:20.130]  Wow.
[20:20.330 --> 20:21.870]  An absolute part of a...
[20:21.870 --> 20:22.030]  Yep.
[20:22.270 --> 20:22.670]  Congratulations.
[20:23.230 --> 20:23.410]  Yep.
[20:23.810 --> 20:24.870]  That's a really nice gift.
[20:26.370 --> 20:27.170]  Thank you, Brandon.
[20:27.670 --> 20:28.070]  Thanks.
[20:28.610 --> 20:30.970]  Like, maybe one of the nicer things
[20:30.970 --> 20:32.990]  a person I've, to my knowledge, never met
[20:32.990 --> 20:33.650]  has ever done for me.
[20:33.650 --> 20:35.950]  Brandon, if you can just contact me
[20:35.950 --> 20:38.150]  on Twitter or Instagram or something,
[20:38.330 --> 20:39.270]  we'll figure it out.
[20:39.310 --> 20:40.870]  I would love to repay you in some way.
[20:40.890 --> 20:41.250]  Yeah.
[20:42.130 --> 20:44.150]  Those cards are...
[20:44.150 --> 20:46.050]  I opened that right before we got here,
[20:46.170 --> 20:48.390]  and I just went, I don't know anything about these,
[20:48.430 --> 20:49.810]  and I went, oh, fuck.
[20:51.210 --> 20:54.690]  The PSA-graded nine was the one you started with.
[20:54.790 --> 20:55.770]  That's a nice card, man.
[20:55.890 --> 20:57.430]  And they got crazier.
[20:58.370 --> 21:00.210]  Yeah, I was afraid, by going from the back,
[21:00.310 --> 21:01.250]  because I thought it was...
[21:01.250 --> 21:02.670]  I could feel that that one was graded.
[21:02.670 --> 21:05.430]  I thought maybe I was going the wrong way with it.
[21:05.470 --> 21:05.970]  But I wasn't.
[21:06.090 --> 21:06.870]  They were all phenomenal.
[21:06.970 --> 21:07.810]  Each one was better than the last.
[21:08.710 --> 21:09.070]  Wow.
[21:11.910 --> 21:12.630]  I'm really...
[21:12.630 --> 21:13.450]  Thank you.
[21:14.770 --> 21:15.450]  You're gonna cry.
[21:16.030 --> 21:16.810]  A little fucking loss for words here.
[21:16.950 --> 21:18.690]  Yeah, I wasn't expecting that.
[21:19.130 --> 21:19.790]  It's pretty incredible.
[21:20.730 --> 21:21.410]  And, Brandon, you are...
[21:21.410 --> 21:22.710]  There's nothing regulation about you, man.
[21:22.970 --> 21:23.270]  Thank you.
[21:23.390 --> 21:23.630]  Yep.
[21:23.970 --> 21:24.830]  I mean, that's really something.
[21:25.510 --> 21:25.870]  Wow.
[21:26.310 --> 21:28.070]  I'm gonna put the army man on top to guard him.
[21:29.170 --> 21:30.450]  Those are going home immediately
[21:30.450 --> 21:31.690]  and never coming back to this building.
[21:34.390 --> 21:34.750]  Ugh.
[21:35.490 --> 21:35.550]  Wow.
[21:35.690 --> 21:36.690]  Man, that's really crazy.
[21:37.230 --> 21:38.330]  Well, that was a great show, guys.
[21:39.270 --> 21:40.950]  So, this will be fucking done.
[21:41.090 --> 21:42.450]  Let's open some packs.
[21:42.570 --> 21:43.410]  You wanna get us some baseball?
[21:43.870 --> 21:44.710]  Let's do some baseball.
[21:44.910 --> 21:45.990]  Okay, now, I think we have to try
[21:45.990 --> 21:47.630]  to keep everything here separate.
[21:47.670 --> 21:48.510]  I'm gonna try that, yeah.
[21:48.590 --> 21:50.990]  Yeah, Emily, you might have to throw them in the...
[21:50.990 --> 21:51.950]  Doritos bag?
[21:53.690 --> 21:54.990]  The binder that you have.
[21:55.150 --> 21:55.470]  Okay.
[21:55.730 --> 21:55.930]  Yeah.
[21:56.290 --> 21:57.050]  That makes sense.
[21:57.250 --> 21:57.550]  Yeah.
[21:58.850 --> 21:59.210]  Let's...
[21:59.210 --> 22:00.970]  We keep these safe in this Doritos bag.
[22:00.970 --> 22:02.050]  So, the Chase...
[22:02.050 --> 22:02.630]  Cool ranch.
[22:02.710 --> 22:05.050]  The big cards you want out of this year's tops
[22:05.050 --> 22:06.590]  are obviously always gonna be rookies.
[22:06.710 --> 22:07.910]  Jason Dominguez.
[22:10.490 --> 22:11.770]  Dustin Henry, is that his name?
[22:13.110 --> 22:15.150]  And then, Ellie De La Cruz.
[22:15.610 --> 22:17.030]  Although, I thought he had a rookie card last year, too,
[22:17.070 --> 22:19.090]  but his rookie card's really sought after right now.
[22:19.910 --> 22:21.090]  So, those are what we're looking for.
[22:21.110 --> 22:22.350]  We're also looking for hometown heroes.
[22:22.790 --> 22:23.150]  That's...
[22:23.150 --> 22:24.090]  And a bunch of other different parallels.
[22:25.050 --> 22:26.690]  They have these things called goldbacks.
[22:27.410 --> 22:30.130]  They have photo variations, as always.
[22:30.130 --> 22:30.870]  Let's see what we got.
[22:30.970 --> 22:31.630]  John Gray.
[22:32.510 --> 22:33.930]  Daniel Palencia, rookie.
[22:35.570 --> 22:35.970]  Seawald.
[22:36.690 --> 22:37.490]  Jesus Lizardo.
[22:38.130 --> 22:38.930]  You think it's Jesus?
[22:39.130 --> 22:40.030]  You think that's how you pronounce it?
[22:40.150 --> 22:40.910]  Jesus Lizardo.
[22:42.330 --> 22:42.670]  George...
[22:42.670 --> 22:42.950]  Boo!
[22:44.350 --> 22:45.310]  Why don't you like him?
[22:45.810 --> 22:48.270]  He was one of the cheating Astros on the cheating Astros.
[22:48.530 --> 22:49.330]  Felix Bautista.
[22:49.870 --> 22:50.370]  Daley Ober.
[22:50.610 --> 22:51.330]  Sterling Marta.
[22:52.890 --> 22:53.470]  Don't matter.
[22:53.710 --> 22:53.930]  It's fine.
[22:54.010 --> 22:54.250]  Keep going.
[22:54.390 --> 22:55.110]  Keep rocking and rolling.
[22:55.670 --> 22:57.310]  This is J-Rod, American League leaders.
[22:57.490 --> 22:58.050]  Oh, that's cool.
[22:58.670 --> 22:59.850]  Adolos Garcia and Kyle Tucker.
[23:02.610 --> 23:02.930]  Angels.
[23:03.910 --> 23:04.230]  Boo!
[23:04.710 --> 23:05.610]  Adley, year two.
[23:07.050 --> 23:08.570]  The Angels are so bad, it's great.
[23:08.650 --> 23:09.470]  Andrew Monasterio.
[23:09.550 --> 23:10.550]  That looks like it could be...
[23:10.550 --> 23:11.130]  Yeah, it might be something.
[23:14.830 --> 23:15.210]  It's not.
[23:15.410 --> 23:16.470]  Look at the poor Angels.
[23:16.610 --> 23:18.170]  Where would it be on the card?
[23:18.210 --> 23:19.990]  Because I can go through and double check the back.
[23:19.990 --> 23:20.970]  Well, for the one of one,
[23:21.050 --> 23:22.190]  it would be like right here, I believe.
[23:22.370 --> 23:22.550]  Okay.
[23:22.830 --> 23:24.450]  But I was looking at the serial number
[23:24.450 --> 23:26.910]  to see if it was a photo variation, but it's not.
[23:27.350 --> 23:28.850]  If it ends in two, I believe it's not.
[23:31.230 --> 23:33.990]  Kiebert Ruiz, Alika Williams.
[23:34.050 --> 23:35.630]  I think it's Kieber Ruiz, but it's okay.
[23:35.890 --> 23:37.910]  I'm not trying to correct you.
[23:38.390 --> 23:39.090]  Kieber Ruiz, that's good.
[23:39.190 --> 23:40.370]  Kieber Ruiz is, yeah.
[23:40.430 --> 23:41.710]  I took most of last year off of these people.
[23:41.710 --> 23:42.710]  I totally understand.
[23:42.970 --> 23:44.250]  Jordan Westberg.
[23:45.510 --> 23:45.950]  Dirty.
[23:46.130 --> 23:46.830]  Eduardo Rodriguez.
[23:47.630 --> 23:48.150]  He's dirty.
[23:48.170 --> 23:48.890]  Mikael Garcia.
[23:48.970 --> 23:49.770]  He had stuff all over him.
[23:50.210 --> 23:52.790]  Tyler Soderstrom, Daniel Bard.
[23:52.890 --> 23:54.070]  I like the Rockies ones.
[23:54.230 --> 23:56.910]  Yeah, their city connects are like nice.
[23:57.390 --> 23:58.170]  Doesn't have anything to do with,
[23:58.170 --> 24:01.010]  I mean, it's a Colorado mountain, but...
[24:01.010 --> 24:03.590]  These are highly controversial, the new design.
[24:03.710 --> 24:05.070]  A lot of people fucking hate them.
[24:05.150 --> 24:05.590]  Okay, let's see.
[24:06.150 --> 24:07.070]  This, I mean, this is,
[24:08.050 --> 24:10.010]  it's a departure from what they've looked like
[24:10.010 --> 24:10.770]  for the last couple of years.
[24:11.090 --> 24:13.770]  Former Padre, now New York Yankee.
[24:14.150 --> 24:16.190]  Trent Grisham in our city connects, too.
[24:17.050 --> 24:20.930]  Here we have a Jose Fermin rookie,
[24:21.590 --> 24:23.930]  like a orange or brown parallel.
[24:24.150 --> 24:25.270]  Oh yeah, it's numbered to...
[24:25.270 --> 24:27.450]  So every year, this is another cool thing that Topps does.
[24:27.450 --> 24:29.830]  They have this color parallel, right?
[24:30.490 --> 24:33.530]  And then they print as many as the year.
[24:33.650 --> 24:35.870]  So this year, this is 1280 out of 2024.
[24:36.170 --> 24:37.950]  So next year, this parallel will be out of 2025.
[24:38.770 --> 24:40.730]  So if you could go ahead and just leave that.
[24:41.290 --> 24:43.690]  We got a backwards card, which means it's a...
[24:43.690 --> 24:44.350]  Oh shit!
[24:44.690 --> 24:45.030]  What'd you get?
[24:45.110 --> 24:45.730]  Hell yeah!
[24:45.870 --> 24:46.370]  Andrew Vaughn.
[24:46.510 --> 24:47.410]  Fuck yeah, dude!
[24:47.510 --> 24:48.650]  I haven't seen one of these yet.
[24:49.370 --> 24:51.610]  It's Andrew Vaughn, but it's a team parallel.
[24:51.710 --> 24:53.110]  So you can see the white socks in the back there.
[24:53.270 --> 24:54.170]  That's really cool.
[24:54.390 --> 24:55.190]  I like that a lot.
[24:55.250 --> 24:56.330]  I was thinking for this year,
[24:56.330 --> 24:58.110]  I might try to get all the white socks
[24:58.110 --> 24:58.790]  and all the tigers.
[24:59.050 --> 24:59.550]  That's a cool idea.
[24:59.810 --> 25:00.670]  Team parallel cards.
[25:01.710 --> 25:02.310]  That's awesome.
[25:02.450 --> 25:04.090]  The gradient at the top of that is weird.
[25:04.150 --> 25:05.430]  But I mean, I guess that's how all the cards are.
[25:05.490 --> 25:07.590]  They have like that sort of gradient at the top.
[25:07.710 --> 25:08.230]  But it's interesting.
[25:08.430 --> 25:10.410]  Here's blue parallel for the Correa shower.
[25:10.790 --> 25:11.750]  Oh, that's a cool picture.
[25:11.950 --> 25:12.130]  There you go.
[25:12.970 --> 25:13.670]  Oh, cool.
[25:13.930 --> 25:14.790]  These are fun cards.
[25:14.870 --> 25:16.010]  I don't know how much they're worth.
[25:16.330 --> 25:17.510]  This one's probably worth a little bit.
[25:18.370 --> 25:19.450]  This is Derek Jeter.
[25:19.970 --> 25:20.510]  Oh wow.
[25:20.850 --> 25:22.390]  These are called...
[25:23.030 --> 25:24.050]  Fuck, I can't remember what they're called.
[25:24.150 --> 25:24.490]  Blueprint.
[25:24.790 --> 25:25.370]  Blueprints, yeah.
[25:26.010 --> 25:26.990]  I believe you're right there.
[25:27.550 --> 25:29.530]  I mean, I just guessed.
[25:30.050 --> 25:30.870]  Anyway, those are cool.
[25:31.170 --> 25:33.590]  And I think they're not case hits, but they're...
[25:33.590 --> 25:33.930]  His...
[25:33.930 --> 25:34.630]  You get like one a box.
[25:34.690 --> 25:36.710]  He's got a whole thing in MLB The Show this year
[25:36.710 --> 25:38.570]  where like you play through his career or whatever.
[25:38.790 --> 25:40.050]  And I don't like him enough to do that.
[25:40.150 --> 25:40.470]  Oh really?
[25:40.590 --> 25:41.470]  Yeah, but I'm still gonna play it.
[25:42.090 --> 25:42.770]  Billy Mays.
[25:43.110 --> 25:46.150]  This is the 89th anniversary.
[25:46.770 --> 25:47.970]  The stamp's cool in the top right.
[25:48.150 --> 25:48.630]  It's just neat.
[25:48.950 --> 25:50.190]  That's the 35th anniversary stamp.
[25:50.350 --> 25:50.550]  So there's...
[25:50.550 --> 25:50.650]  I like that.
[25:51.270 --> 25:52.450]  I think you can get the whole...
[25:52.450 --> 25:53.210]  There's a whole bunch of these.
[25:53.350 --> 25:54.070]  They're really nice.
[25:54.590 --> 25:56.190]  We got Shohei, stars of the MLB.
[25:56.390 --> 25:57.390]  These stars of the MLB,
[25:57.490 --> 26:00.190]  they have these parallels every year and they're dog shit.
[26:00.330 --> 26:01.710]  This year, they actually don't look too bad.
[26:01.790 --> 26:02.170]  No, it's okay.
[26:02.510 --> 26:03.350]  So we got that.
[26:03.430 --> 26:04.230]  Got Bobby Witt Jr.
[26:04.990 --> 26:05.870]  I'm gonna go ahead and slip you back those.
[26:06.510 --> 26:08.730]  Royce Lewis, Luke Bailey.
[26:09.630 --> 26:11.690]  You wanna put him right in the middle of that square.
[26:14.150 --> 26:18.470]  Astros, Jorge Mateo, Byron Buxton, J.D. Davis,
[26:18.810 --> 26:20.830]  Evan Carter, Rookie, and Michael Harris.
[26:22.130 --> 26:24.110]  So, we'll set these aside.
[26:24.230 --> 26:24.530]  Interesting.
[26:24.710 --> 26:25.990]  And say that those are the hangar cards.
[26:26.090 --> 26:27.490]  That's actually a pretty solid box.
[26:27.630 --> 26:29.530]  Do you hate the Dodgers more than the Astros?
[26:29.650 --> 26:31.110]  I hate the Dodgers more than anything.
[26:31.430 --> 26:32.130]  Oh, wow.
[26:32.950 --> 26:34.310]  I think that is, in my life,
[26:34.390 --> 26:36.010]  probably the number one most hated thing.
[26:36.330 --> 26:36.690]  The Dodgers?
[26:36.930 --> 26:36.950]  Yeah.
[26:37.450 --> 26:38.410]  I hate them so much.
[26:39.090 --> 26:40.570]  For a long time, the Raiders.
[26:40.990 --> 26:42.930]  Like, Dodger, you can eliminate...
[26:42.930 --> 26:44.830]  He's back and he's madder than ever.
[26:45.210 --> 26:45.650]  Who?
[26:46.030 --> 26:46.790]  I'm getting there.
[26:46.890 --> 26:49.510]  You can eliminate the Dodgers from existence,
[26:49.510 --> 26:50.470]  or Hitler.
[26:50.930 --> 26:52.530]  I mean, I think I would eliminate Hitler.
[26:52.790 --> 26:54.170]  Okay, you don't hate the Dodgers that much.
[26:54.310 --> 26:58.710]  I hate the Dodgers for baseball.
[26:59.530 --> 27:01.290]  Hitler, I think, is a different...
[27:01.290 --> 27:02.090]  Whole different animals.
[27:02.790 --> 27:03.950]  It's a whole different animal.
[27:04.370 --> 27:05.270]  That's great, though.
[27:05.350 --> 27:06.550]  Let us know in the chat.
[27:06.630 --> 27:08.870]  Would you eliminate the Los Angeles Dodgers
[27:08.870 --> 27:09.870]  or Adolf Hitler?
[27:10.650 --> 27:11.810]  Leave a comment below.
[27:12.030 --> 27:12.430]  It's a...
[27:12.430 --> 27:13.430]  Smash that subscribe button.
[27:13.850 --> 27:15.330]  Fuckfacepod.com slash first.
[27:17.150 --> 27:18.410]  Now we know that he doesn't,
[27:18.410 --> 27:20.070]  that there are things he hates more than the Dodgers.
[27:20.930 --> 27:23.790]  Nick Sinzel, Mike Yastrzemski, Owen White,
[27:23.930 --> 27:26.030]  Raphael Devers, Logan Webb,
[27:28.210 --> 27:29.410]  Johan Rojas.
[27:29.530 --> 27:29.910]  There you go.
[27:30.090 --> 27:32.110]  Jake Rogers, Taylor Rogers.
[27:32.430 --> 27:33.650]  The Rogers twins.
[27:33.850 --> 27:37.370]  No, Taylor Rogers is brothers with a different Rogers
[27:37.370 --> 27:38.170]  that plays baseball.
[27:38.330 --> 27:38.530]  Really?
[27:38.670 --> 27:38.810]  Yeah.
[27:39.130 --> 27:39.670]  That's crazy.
[27:39.910 --> 27:40.990]  Quinn Priester.
[27:42.030 --> 27:43.990]  What's the most common last name in baseball?
[27:44.290 --> 27:44.930]  Probably Rogers.
[27:45.330 --> 27:45.910]  Do you think...
[27:46.690 --> 27:48.830]  Do you think two priests have ever been in a fight
[27:48.830 --> 27:49.670]  about who's a better priest?
[27:49.770 --> 27:51.290]  Someone was like, I'm more priester than you are.
[27:51.330 --> 27:51.730]  I'm priester than you?
[27:52.370 --> 27:53.350]  Alex Bregman.
[27:53.830 --> 27:54.690]  Now you love your asterisk.
[27:55.690 --> 27:57.590]  Corbin Carroll stars in the MLB.
[27:58.010 --> 27:58.770]  We'll go ahead and sleeve that.
[27:59.190 --> 28:00.770]  And then Marco Luciano.
[28:00.890 --> 28:01.970]  So this is the blaster box.
[28:02.110 --> 28:02.490]  We're just gonna...
[28:02.490 --> 28:02.650]  Yeah.
[28:03.030 --> 28:03.550]  Blaster them.
[28:03.810 --> 28:05.170]  None of these were first print.
[28:05.550 --> 28:06.030]  Okay, thank you.
[28:06.030 --> 28:06.390]  I checked.
[28:06.590 --> 28:06.890]  Sad.
[28:07.410 --> 28:07.610]  Cry.
[28:08.490 --> 28:09.710]  Oh shit, here's another one.
[28:09.810 --> 28:10.030]  Great.
[28:11.870 --> 28:13.030]  Jordan Blazovec rookie.
[28:13.310 --> 28:15.030]  And this is the Easter egg parallel.
[28:15.030 --> 28:15.750]  Oh!
[28:15.810 --> 28:16.950]  On a rookie card.
[28:17.310 --> 28:17.630]  That looks like an acorn.
[28:17.650 --> 28:18.610]  That's what you were talking about.
[28:18.630 --> 28:19.730]  It does look like an acorn.
[28:19.810 --> 28:20.870]  Think it's an Easter egg.
[28:21.250 --> 28:21.670]  I think you're right.
[28:21.670 --> 28:22.670]  That's fucking cool.
[28:23.130 --> 28:23.830]  So that's neat.
[28:24.790 --> 28:29.970]  Royce Lewis, Astros, Luke Reilly, Jorge Mateo.
[28:30.250 --> 28:30.990]  Oh, he's flying!
[28:31.150 --> 28:31.610]  There he is.
[28:32.070 --> 28:32.330]  Ah!
[28:32.930 --> 28:33.610]  He's trying to...
[28:33.610 --> 28:34.170]  It looks like he's...
[28:34.170 --> 28:34.690]  Ah!
[28:34.690 --> 28:36.250]  It looks like he's hanging onto the Orioles.
[28:36.270 --> 28:38.690]  It looks like he's taking off like Superman.
[28:38.850 --> 28:39.590]  Or he's pushing it up.
[28:39.790 --> 28:39.890]  Here, go.
[28:41.570 --> 28:44.150]  JP Crawford, Luken Baker, Patrick.
[28:44.150 --> 28:45.290]  Plenty of wisdom.
[28:45.590 --> 28:47.010]  Paul Goldschmidt.
[28:47.630 --> 28:48.430]  Oh, here we go.
[28:48.530 --> 28:51.110]  There's an insert series of the King of Virginia's career.
[28:51.270 --> 28:52.070]  Salvation of the Kids.
[28:52.230 --> 28:54.930]  So here he is as a mariner.
[28:56.890 --> 28:58.890]  Emmett Sheehan, 89 throwback rookie.
[28:59.610 --> 29:01.370]  Mookie Betts, stars of the MLB.
[29:01.530 --> 29:01.730]  Boom!
[29:02.090 --> 29:02.930]  And then Matt Manning.
[29:03.230 --> 29:03.890]  So we'll set that aside.
[29:04.150 --> 29:06.970]  Man, that Easter egg parallel is really cool.
[29:08.430 --> 29:10.070]  Rodrigo in the chat is saying it's a little concerning
[29:10.070 --> 29:12.010]  how much of the chat is on the fence about Hitler.
[29:12.190 --> 29:12.450]  Guys.
[29:12.750 --> 29:13.430]  From Byron Buxton.
[29:13.950 --> 29:16.690]  Davis, Evan Carter, Michael Harris,
[29:17.770 --> 29:21.610]  Gleyber Torres, here's a Desert Dance-off.
[29:21.810 --> 29:23.610]  We got a Coco Montez rookie.
[29:24.150 --> 29:25.010]  Kyle Bradish.
[29:25.650 --> 29:26.970]  Then, oh, here we go.
[29:27.210 --> 29:29.850]  Here's a Jose Rodriguez.
[29:30.950 --> 29:31.970]  J-Rod?
[29:32.390 --> 29:34.170]  Different J-Rod.
[29:34.470 --> 29:35.850]  Jose Rodriguez, White Sox rookie.
[29:35.970 --> 29:38.590]  This is some sort of a teal or light blue parallel.
[29:39.030 --> 29:40.330]  And this is numbered to 50.
[29:40.810 --> 29:42.710]  So that is a huge fuckin' part.
[29:42.710 --> 29:43.130]  Nice!
[29:44.750 --> 29:47.230]  Then we have this Walker Bueller,
[29:47.850 --> 29:49.530]  appears to be a foil card.
[29:50.330 --> 29:50.910]  Right, yeah?
[29:51.370 --> 29:51.590]  Yeah.
[29:51.950 --> 29:52.650]  So that's cool.
[29:52.790 --> 29:53.590]  And we hate him.
[29:54.650 --> 29:55.350]  We hate him?
[29:55.450 --> 29:56.250]  Oh, because he's a Dodger.
[29:56.550 --> 29:58.910]  Pete Crow Armstrong rookie, and I love him.
[29:59.210 --> 30:00.850]  And then Ryan Geoffers.
[30:01.050 --> 30:01.250]  Okay.
[30:01.790 --> 30:03.010]  Making our way through.
[30:03.270 --> 30:04.430]  About halfway through the episode.
[30:04.930 --> 30:05.950]  Making our way through.
[30:06.930 --> 30:08.050]  This is gonna take me a lot of work
[30:08.050 --> 30:09.010]  to figure out what they're all worth,
[30:09.070 --> 30:10.610]  but oh shit, here we go again.
[30:10.770 --> 30:11.010]  Let's see.
[30:11.010 --> 30:13.610]  Brendan Rogers, this is a,
[30:13.730 --> 30:14.790]  I don't know what this parallel is.
[30:14.850 --> 30:15.330]  Do you guys get it?
[30:15.350 --> 30:18.010]  Would it be an egg, rabbit, flower,
[30:18.210 --> 30:19.950]  umbrella, watering can, or chicks?
[30:20.150 --> 30:21.150]  I think it's a flower?
[30:21.690 --> 30:22.490]  I think it's a flower.
[30:22.670 --> 30:23.390]  I think it's a flower.
[30:23.630 --> 30:24.610]  Okay, so Gracie, what does that look like?
[30:24.910 --> 30:25.550]  The background.
[30:27.150 --> 30:27.510]  Flower?
[30:29.830 --> 30:30.610]  Is feathers one of them?
[30:30.750 --> 30:31.490]  I think flower.
[30:31.910 --> 30:32.210]  Okay.
[30:32.370 --> 30:33.030]  But, yeah.
[30:34.970 --> 30:38.890]  Leodi Tavoris, Dane Meyers, Ryan Mountcastle is saying...
[30:39.510 --> 30:40.550]  He's touching the O.
[30:40.550 --> 30:41.990]  That's funny, too.
[30:42.270 --> 30:43.570]  He's fingering it, it's fine.
[30:44.550 --> 30:49.210]  Freddy Peralta, Craig, oh, Kevin Biggio.
[30:49.250 --> 30:50.510]  Sorry, his kid, I guess.
[30:51.230 --> 30:52.030]  Zach Remillard.
[30:52.330 --> 30:53.730]  Do you remember, do you remember,
[30:53.930 --> 30:55.050]  I am Dr. Remulak.
[30:55.190 --> 30:57.570]  I am Dr. Remulak, old Howard Stern.
[30:57.890 --> 30:58.610]  The guy that would call up
[30:58.610 --> 30:59.690]  and he would just say it over and over again.
[30:59.930 --> 31:00.750]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:00.750 --> 31:02.070]  I am Dr. Remulak, yeah.
[31:03.390 --> 31:07.330]  Joe Ryan, Danny Jansen, it's the Dodgers.
[31:07.670 --> 31:08.070]  Hey!
[31:08.070 --> 31:08.110]  Boom!
[31:09.310 --> 31:12.790]  We got a Corbin Carroll blueprint, that's nice.
[31:14.490 --> 31:15.290]  Jazz Chisholm.
[31:15.770 --> 31:17.950]  Great baseball name, Jazz Chisholm, Jr.
[31:18.210 --> 31:20.310]  Andrew Abbott, Rookie Cup, we're gonna sleep that, too.
[31:20.950 --> 31:22.550]  Another thing to look for in these
[31:22.550 --> 31:24.310]  is they have these pretty rare parallels
[31:24.930 --> 31:28.190]  that are called vintage, they're on vintage card stock,
[31:28.250 --> 31:29.870]  and the only way to tell is that the Topps logo
[31:29.870 --> 31:31.330]  is the old-timey Topps logo.
[31:31.350 --> 31:31.710]  Oh, really?
[31:32.190 --> 31:34.270]  You really gotta fucking study Topps cards this year.
[31:34.370 --> 31:35.470]  I don't think I wanna do that.
[31:35.830 --> 31:36.790]  Well, they don't want you to,
[31:36.790 --> 31:38.690]  they're trying to get you to slow down.
[31:38.930 --> 31:41.230]  Reed Detmers, Brad Keller, they taste the Topps.
[31:41.230 --> 31:42.130]  Taste the Topps.
[31:42.170 --> 31:44.470]  Harold Ramirez, Grant Hartwig.
[31:44.530 --> 31:45.390]  As we go through these guys,
[31:45.490 --> 31:47.150]  just look at the Topps logo in the top left,
[31:47.210 --> 31:47.970]  let us know. Anthony Rizzo,
[31:48.050 --> 31:48.890]  yeah, let us know if I miss it,
[31:48.910 --> 31:49.370]  because I probably will.
[31:49.470 --> 31:53.270]  Bryce Elder, Joey Weimer, Rainer.
[31:54.110 --> 31:54.830]  Mackenzie Gore.
[31:55.490 --> 31:56.810]  What's the old logo look like?
[31:57.090 --> 31:59.970]  It's like a T, and it goes like that,
[32:00.070 --> 32:00.710]  and it's like, opsy.
[32:00.730 --> 32:00.910]  Okay.
[32:01.310 --> 32:03.130]  We got that Matt Manning blue parallel,
[32:03.470 --> 32:04.190]  let's leave that.
[32:04.190 --> 32:07.630]  Corey Seeger, MLB, is a star, I guess.
[32:08.370 --> 32:09.670]  All right, two more packs of Blaster.
[32:09.730 --> 32:11.030]  This Blaster has been really good.
[32:11.190 --> 32:11.990]  We've had a lot of luck.
[32:12.150 --> 32:13.490]  I had noticed a big pile of stuff
[32:13.490 --> 32:14.230]  that you had in my sleeve.
[32:14.410 --> 32:15.690]  I've opened a bunch of these at home,
[32:15.810 --> 32:17.390]  and I haven't got shit, so it's been nice.
[32:17.390 --> 32:17.830]  Backwards card.
[32:18.570 --> 32:20.910]  Here we got another, this Padres rookie,
[32:21.750 --> 32:23.230]  Matt Waldron flower parallel.
[32:24.710 --> 32:29.850]  J-Rod, Maurizio Dubon, that's funny.
[32:31.030 --> 32:36.330]  Brendan Donovan, Nick Robertson, three assholes.
[32:37.030 --> 32:37.850]  Lana Bray.
[32:37.910 --> 32:38.710]  Oh my God.
[32:38.930 --> 32:39.570]  I just don't wanna read them.
[32:39.950 --> 32:42.450]  Jared Triolo, Geraldo Perdomo.
[32:42.810 --> 32:44.770]  We got a Geoff Bagwell throwback.
[32:44.850 --> 32:45.230]  Oh, nice.
[32:45.270 --> 32:48.150]  I think Geoff Bagwell probably had worms a few times, right?
[32:48.290 --> 32:49.370]  Oh, I think you're right.
[32:49.610 --> 32:53.950]  Riley Greene, and then Cole Raggins.
[32:54.330 --> 32:57.670]  Was there another Bagwell in the MLB?
[32:58.290 --> 32:59.790]  I think it's Kidd, right?
[33:00.310 --> 33:01.010]  Is this Kidd?
[33:01.290 --> 33:02.070]  I don't know, I'm just guessing.
[33:02.210 --> 33:02.930]  Cavan Bagwell?
[33:05.630 --> 33:09.270]  If he has a kid who plays, he's probably on the Blue Jays.
[33:09.270 --> 33:10.590]  Those all have to stay together, too.
[33:10.930 --> 33:12.390]  I know, but I'm just checking.
[33:13.590 --> 33:14.310]  Dansby Swanson.
[33:14.630 --> 33:15.350]  That's a great baseball name.
[33:15.470 --> 33:16.010]  God, I love it.
[33:16.110 --> 33:16.930]  Nestor Cortez.
[33:17.030 --> 33:17.730]  Nestor's a good name, too.
[33:18.190 --> 33:19.230]  Some more dudes.
[33:20.630 --> 33:20.990]  Padres.
[33:21.270 --> 33:23.470]  Hey, all right, the city can actually handle Padres.
[33:24.650 --> 33:25.370]  Alex Kirilov.
[33:26.070 --> 33:26.790]  Patrick Corbin.
[33:26.970 --> 33:28.050]  Dave Schneider.
[33:28.170 --> 33:29.550]  How many Dave Schneiders do you think there have been
[33:29.550 --> 33:30.330]  through history?
[33:30.550 --> 33:31.450]  Like, in the world?
[33:31.570 --> 33:31.750]  Yeah.
[33:31.870 --> 33:32.190]  A lot.
[33:33.650 --> 33:34.370]  Braxton Garrett.
[33:35.970 --> 33:36.690]  Zach Gelof.
[33:37.130 --> 33:37.710]  Oh, cool.
[33:37.930 --> 33:38.330]  That'd be fun to talk about.
[33:38.330 --> 33:39.050]  That's almost your name.
[33:40.750 --> 33:41.290]  That's true.
[33:42.650 --> 33:43.770]  Stars of the MLB.
[33:45.330 --> 33:46.890]  Christian Encarnacion Strand.
[33:46.990 --> 33:47.650]  I don't know him yet.
[33:49.750 --> 33:50.470]  Christian Bethencourt.
[33:50.630 --> 33:52.150]  And then, got one of these Home Run Challenge cards.
[33:52.610 --> 33:54.090]  I don't know if I've ever shown these to you guys before.
[33:54.090 --> 33:54.730]  What is this?
[33:55.350 --> 33:56.910]  Oh, yeah, it's so fun.
[33:57.050 --> 33:58.970]  Topps does this little game every year
[33:59.590 --> 34:00.970]  where, if you get one of these cards,
[34:01.030 --> 34:02.610]  it says, pick a game for a shot to win.
[34:02.670 --> 34:03.950]  So, this is Ronald Acuña, Jr.
[34:04.270 --> 34:06.670]  So, you go on the back and you scratch this off
[34:06.670 --> 34:08.790]  and you enter in a code on the Topps website
[34:08.790 --> 34:11.450]  and you say, I think, and you can pick any game
[34:11.450 --> 34:12.910]  from the 162-game season.
[34:13.110 --> 34:17.470]  And you say, Acuña's gonna hit a homer in game 64.
[34:17.610 --> 34:20.950]  And if he does, they will mail you a special numbered card
[34:20.950 --> 34:22.870]  that's, like, numbered to 200,
[34:23.010 --> 34:24.470]  or I think however many people got it right.
[34:25.010 --> 34:27.550]  I did this a bunch when I was buying a bunch of baseball
[34:27.550 --> 34:29.850]  the year that Judge hit 60-whatever.
[34:30.450 --> 34:32.770]  And I got three Judge cards.
[34:33.010 --> 34:33.470]  Holy shit!
[34:33.530 --> 34:36.150]  I got these and I hit it right on three Aaron Judges.
[34:36.290 --> 34:38.290]  I have three pretty nice parallels.
[34:38.410 --> 34:39.030]  That's pretty wild, dude.
[34:39.030 --> 34:40.310]  And you took into consideration
[34:40.310 --> 34:42.230]  the field that they were playing at.
[34:42.430 --> 34:43.090]  I did, I did.
[34:43.170 --> 34:43.790]  I paid attention.
[34:44.610 --> 34:45.290]  Sleeve all these?
[34:45.710 --> 34:46.810]  No, no, they just go in there.
[34:47.130 --> 34:48.510]  Keep the home run challenge one.
[34:49.230 --> 34:50.890]  Sleeve that one, just so I can see it.
[34:51.030 --> 34:53.050]  Just so he can do the home run challenge.
[34:53.050 --> 34:54.410]  Yeah, I gotta go back and do it.
[34:54.510 --> 34:55.850]  Okay, so now we're gonna do hanger.
[34:55.990 --> 34:56.750]  Hangers are bangers.
[34:56.910 --> 34:57.510]  Everybody knows that.
[34:57.630 --> 34:58.710]  Everyone knows that.
[34:59.150 --> 35:01.050]  For retail, these are considered to be the best
[35:01.870 --> 35:03.410]  in terms of getting your return.
[35:08.280 --> 35:10.020]  I've recently given up on my dumb idea
[35:10.020 --> 35:11.780]  to build a house out of all the card boxes,
[35:12.020 --> 35:12.480]  so I'm throwing them away now.
[35:12.720 --> 35:15.440]  But all the card boxes are still in our storage unit.
[35:15.480 --> 35:16.320]  Next time we go to storage,
[35:16.440 --> 35:17.560]  I'll get them and I'll throw them away.
[35:18.500 --> 35:20.000]  It's a fuckin' waste of an awesome idea,
[35:20.120 --> 35:20.660]  but I'm gonna do it.
[35:20.660 --> 35:21.560]  That's all you have?
[35:21.700 --> 35:23.780]  Nolan Arenado, Gray Kessinger,
[35:24.500 --> 35:26.300]  Meryl Kelly, Louisa Brayes,
[35:26.680 --> 35:27.540]  Leo de Tavares.
[35:27.740 --> 35:29.060]  It's not because you didn't pressure me.
[35:29.200 --> 35:31.160]  I just have decided that I'm not gonna do it.
[35:31.560 --> 35:33.120]  Dane Meyers, Ryan Mountcastle.
[35:33.140 --> 35:33.840]  I just know me.
[35:33.960 --> 35:34.480]  Oh, he's touching that up.
[35:34.520 --> 35:34.960]  Again?
[35:35.200 --> 35:36.260]  William Contreras.
[35:36.480 --> 35:37.520]  Stop getting Ryan Mountcastle.
[35:37.520 --> 35:38.240]  He can't get enough.
[35:38.700 --> 35:40.940]  Prelander Baroah, Kenley Jansen,
[35:42.480 --> 35:44.020]  Framber Valdez, Tyler O'Neal.
[35:44.380 --> 35:45.380]  Which player do you not like,
[35:45.460 --> 35:47.160]  not because they're problematic,
[35:47.380 --> 35:49.380]  like all the sexual assault things.
[35:49.380 --> 35:51.240]  So which Dodger do I hate the most?
[35:51.440 --> 35:51.820]  Okay, sure.
[35:52.280 --> 35:52.920]  Willy Shohei?
[35:53.720 --> 35:55.420]  I mean, now probably, yeah.
[35:55.720 --> 35:57.140]  We'll just throw at him, it'll be fine.
[35:57.200 --> 35:57.920]  George Springer, boo!
[35:59.540 --> 36:00.420]  I'm gonna let you guys talk.
[36:00.460 --> 36:01.840]  Is that the whole point, to throw at him?
[36:01.980 --> 36:02.380]  Yeah, hopefully.
[36:02.500 --> 36:03.980]  Ooh, that Joe Musgrove card is sick.
[36:04.220 --> 36:04.660]  That's cool.
[36:04.800 --> 36:05.160]  Look at him.
[36:05.260 --> 36:05.680]  You want it?
[36:05.740 --> 36:06.180]  Look at him.
[36:06.740 --> 36:07.800]  No, I'm not gonna do anything with it.
[36:07.820 --> 36:08.380]  I just think it's cool.
[36:08.500 --> 36:09.360]  Colton Couser.
[36:09.760 --> 36:10.720]  I mean, it's probably...
[36:10.720 --> 36:12.100]  I wanna say Mookie Betts,
[36:12.120 --> 36:13.060]  but it's probably not Mookie Betts.
[36:13.120 --> 36:14.280]  Aw, he's so cute, though.
[36:14.360 --> 36:14.500]  Yeah.
[36:14.900 --> 36:15.360]  He is cute.
[36:16.020 --> 36:17.460]  Taylor Rodgers, Quinn Feaster.
[36:17.460 --> 36:18.860]  You like Freddie Freeman, though, right?
[36:18.940 --> 36:19.920]  You're a big Freddie Freeman fan.
[36:20.460 --> 36:21.320]  Alex Bregman.
[36:21.440 --> 36:23.700]  I think the Braves did him so dirty, that sucks.
[36:23.800 --> 36:24.420]  Choco Montez.
[36:24.420 --> 36:25.060]  Who's your favorite?
[36:25.240 --> 36:25.480]  Padres.
[36:26.400 --> 36:27.060]  That's tough.
[36:30.940 --> 36:32.400]  It's probably Manny Machado.
[36:32.940 --> 36:34.280]  It's, he's just...
[36:34.280 --> 36:35.720]  I love watching Manny Machado play.
[36:36.300 --> 36:37.640]  And people just hate him.
[36:37.780 --> 36:38.720]  People fucking hate him.
[36:39.940 --> 36:42.340]  Corey Seeger, yellow parallel.
[36:42.340 --> 36:45.140]  That is, man, I wish that the Rangers
[36:45.140 --> 36:47.820]  had a cool City Connect.
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.040]  It's almost cool.
[36:49.180 --> 36:49.900]  It's just so plain.
[36:50.120 --> 36:52.080]  Man, we're killing all these Jose Rodriguez, man.
[36:52.360 --> 36:54.000]  Yellow parallel, sleeve that.
[36:54.240 --> 36:54.660]  Get them all.
[36:55.000 --> 36:56.780]  Vlad Jr., 89 throwback.
[36:57.720 --> 36:59.920]  Speaking of, Freddie Freeman.
[37:00.240 --> 37:00.560]  Boo.
[37:02.100 --> 37:02.620]  Lubob.
[37:03.400 --> 37:04.120]  Not a leader.
[37:06.140 --> 37:07.560]  Sal Frelick, rookie.

[37:14.660 --> 37:15.680]  That's a cool card.
[37:15.760 --> 37:16.100]  That's cool.
[37:16.180 --> 37:16.700]  Those are cool cards.
[37:16.780 --> 37:19.700]  They always do some kind of cool old-timey insert.

[37:22.720 --> 37:23.180]  Zach Wheeler.

[37:24.500 --> 37:25.240]  You hate Max Muncy.
[37:25.340 --> 37:25.780]  I hate Max Muncy.
[37:26.360 --> 37:28.560]  Watching him slump was great.
[37:28.860 --> 37:29.520]  He slumped hard.
[37:29.600 --> 37:30.720]  Hasan Kim rules.
[37:31.580 --> 37:31.740]  Great.
[37:31.840 --> 37:32.420]  Tyler Soderstrom.
[37:32.840 --> 37:34.520]  Yeah, watching him slump was funny.
[37:35.640 --> 37:37.100]  You had sleeve Soderstrom.
[37:37.640 --> 37:38.940]  And then here, keep all those together.
[37:39.260 --> 37:39.680]  Soderstrom.
[37:39.980 --> 37:40.760]  Do you have the box?
[37:41.700 --> 37:42.140]  Yeah.
[37:42.380 --> 37:43.620]  That's how I've been keeping it tidy.
[37:44.100 --> 37:44.920]  That's good thinking.
[37:45.180 --> 37:45.640]  It's a good system.
[37:45.740 --> 37:46.060]  Thank you.
[37:46.100 --> 37:46.760]  It's a great system, Emily.

[38:09.880 --> 38:10.280]  Okay.

[38:14.840 --> 38:16.040]  I don't know.
[38:16.640 --> 38:18.020]  I just don't know what it looks like.
[38:19.440 --> 38:20.900]  I just got no idea.
[38:21.120 --> 38:22.660]  Have you plugged Clutch My Pearls yet or no?
[38:22.900 --> 38:26.140]  No, but I'd love it if people listen to Clutch My Pearls everywhere.

[39:27.280 --> 39:28.980]  Bass, Justin Steele, Paul Goldschmidt.
[39:29.560 --> 39:31.140]  Now, it's a delightful podcast,
[39:31.300 --> 39:32.180]  the Clutch My Pearls podcast.
[39:32.680 --> 39:35.060]  Yeah, now you can see all of our expressions and eye rolls.
[39:35.420 --> 39:37.680]  And I've started doing a really fun thing where,
[39:38.060 --> 39:39.320]  when I'm reading the really nasty parts
[39:39.320 --> 39:41.440]  Yeah, you're just like staring right at Vanessa?
[39:41.940 --> 39:43.320]  I stare at Vanessa and your wife,
[39:43.500 --> 39:44.780]  and it's like, who's gonna get it?
[39:44.880 --> 39:46.180]  This guy's name is Trey Cash.
[39:46.200 --> 39:47.800]  That's a food man if I've ever seen it.
[39:47.940 --> 39:48.440]  That's a food man.
[39:48.520 --> 39:50.260]  We'll have to look for it in the future.
[39:50.360 --> 39:51.560]  We gotta keep all these together for right now.
[39:52.160 --> 39:54.000]  Cutter Crawford, that's a good name for baseball.
[39:54.440 --> 39:55.900]  Oh, Kodai Senga, that's a good card.
[39:56.920 --> 39:58.960]  Here's the Red Sox, Alex Verdugo.
[39:59.460 --> 40:00.760]  Yeah, if you like...
[40:00.760 --> 40:02.600]  Did you know that vampires have dog dicks?
[40:02.920 --> 40:03.700]  Oh my gosh. I didn't either.
[40:03.740 --> 40:05.400]  No, no, I think it's werewolves.
[40:05.780 --> 40:06.920]  Oh, werewolves have dog dicks.
[40:06.920 --> 40:10.520]  Apparently, we were educated by everyone who was like,
[40:10.680 --> 40:12.420]  actually, that's not fully the Omegaverse.
[40:12.560 --> 40:13.620]  Did you get into the Omegaverse?
[40:13.720 --> 40:15.080]  But we're just dipping our toes in.
[40:15.100 --> 40:18.060]  All right, well this box, this pack just fucking...
[40:18.060 --> 40:18.860]  Did we just go off?
[40:18.900 --> 40:20.280]  Yeah. Did you just get a dog dick?
[40:20.380 --> 40:22.240]  There, we got the NL League leaders.
[40:22.640 --> 40:23.640]  There's the Rays.
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.000]  Here's Hunter Green.
[40:25.720 --> 40:26.860]  Let's do it this way.
[40:27.040 --> 40:28.900]  Here's Ronald Acuna Jr., stars of the MLB.
[40:29.020 --> 40:29.340]  Nice.
[40:29.940 --> 40:31.480]  Here's the home run...
[40:31.480 --> 40:32.160]  Oh, really? Who is it?
[40:32.160 --> 40:33.380]  This one's Ozzy Albys.
[40:34.180 --> 40:34.580]  Yeah.
[40:34.860 --> 40:39.400]  This is an Aaron Judge, 89 throwback.
[40:39.580 --> 40:39.840]  Wow.
[40:40.060 --> 40:41.480]  Some sort of a...
[40:41.480 --> 40:43.580]  I like the name Ozzy Albys.
[40:43.620 --> 40:44.380]  Yeah, this is a good one.
[40:44.540 --> 40:45.420]  Alby's a cute name.
[40:45.500 --> 40:45.900]  Feels good.
[40:46.060 --> 40:47.260]  This might actually be the foil board,
[40:47.420 --> 40:49.960]  but this is something I'm excited to get.
[40:50.900 --> 40:52.980]  These are called, I don't remember exactly
[40:52.980 --> 40:55.140]  what they're called, but it's like a photo variation.
[40:55.460 --> 40:56.120]  It's not a photo variation,
[40:56.200 --> 40:57.500]  but it's like a photo... There's nothing on the card.
[40:57.800 --> 40:58.920]  Where it's everything is removed,
[40:59.020 --> 40:59.920]  and it's just the photo.
[41:00.100 --> 41:00.360]  Okay.
[41:00.800 --> 41:01.680]  Those are pretty rare.
[41:02.080 --> 41:02.360]  Oh.
[41:02.360 --> 41:03.800]  They're not numbered or anything,
[41:04.060 --> 41:05.800]  but this is awesome.
[41:06.260 --> 41:07.200]  This is really awesome.
[41:07.420 --> 41:07.880]  I'm really excited.
[41:07.880 --> 41:08.180]  It looks cool.
[41:08.180 --> 41:09.120]  Have you ever had one before?
[41:09.780 --> 41:10.840]  No, not so far.
[41:11.160 --> 41:11.240]  Huh.
[41:11.900 --> 41:12.880]  Is this new this year?
[41:12.880 --> 41:13.580]  Yeah, this is...
[41:13.580 --> 41:14.780]  I think that they've only launched...
[41:14.780 --> 41:16.440]  They've done a lot of different variations.
[41:16.780 --> 41:17.680]  Yeah, you really have to pay attention.
[41:18.380 --> 41:18.780]  Yeah, you do.

[41:28.660 --> 41:29.440]  We have...
[41:29.440 --> 41:29.740]  Okay.

[41:34.340 --> 41:35.440]  Matt Olsen.
[41:35.860 --> 41:40.280]  Shout out to Bruno P. Torres in the chat
[41:40.280 --> 41:43.040]  for plugging our link tree for Clutchpoint Pearls.
[41:43.100 --> 41:44.720]  Oh my God, thank you.
[41:48.280 --> 41:50.360]  That's my new book boyfriend right now.
[41:50.540 --> 41:50.960]  Bruno.
[41:51.440 --> 41:52.640]  We're gonna get through...
[41:52.640 --> 41:54.860]  I also can't read very well, so I'm like...
[41:54.860 --> 41:56.320]  It's great for a book podcast.
[41:56.360 --> 41:58.040]  Yeah, good thing I don't read.
[41:58.560 --> 42:00.860]  Gregory Santos, Brandon Nemo,
[42:01.140 --> 42:01.960]  and the league leaders again.
[42:02.040 --> 42:02.760]  It's the Yankees.
[42:03.860 --> 42:04.660]  Thiaro Estrada.
[42:05.600 --> 42:06.340]  He's flying.
[42:06.660 --> 42:09.200]  There are a lot of dudes that like to throw fly.
[42:09.920 --> 42:11.160]  A.J. Smith-Shower,
[42:12.480 --> 42:13.280]  Elejuris Montero.
[42:13.400 --> 42:15.480]  Here we have a Bobby Witt Jr. blueprint.
[42:15.880 --> 42:16.380]  That's cool.
[42:16.500 --> 42:17.600]  I'm gonna have a whole set of those by this.

[42:20.060 --> 42:22.220]  Best Beard in Baseball, Christopher Morel,
[42:22.380 --> 42:23.560]  and then Dalton Varshow.
[42:23.820 --> 42:24.580]  That's a cool catch.
[42:24.640 --> 42:25.220]  That's a cool one.
[42:25.220 --> 42:27.440]  It looks like he's hanging on to the J.
[42:28.100 --> 42:28.980]  Let's go ahead and sleeve that,
[42:29.080 --> 42:30.480]  just because it's funny and I'll remember that it's there.
[42:31.100 --> 42:31.220]  All right.
[42:32.580 --> 42:33.920]  I'm gonna try to blaze through these.
[42:34.040 --> 42:35.980]  I'll probably just call out the hits, you know.
[42:36.920 --> 42:38.480]  You do what you feel, dude.
[42:38.660 --> 42:39.660]  Oh, there's one of the asterisks.
[42:40.120 --> 42:41.580]  Well, there's like, no, no, no more cheating.
[42:42.220 --> 42:44.360]  Probably a no-hitter, but no-cheater.
[42:44.580 --> 42:45.040]  That's what we call him.
[42:45.400 --> 42:49.200]  Shane Bieber, Jonathan Oviedo, Dylan Cease.
[42:49.580 --> 42:51.560]  Oh, here's a cool Estuary Ruiz card.
[42:52.340 --> 42:53.320]  Oh, I like the way you said that.
[42:53.340 --> 42:53.660]  Say it again.
[42:55.040 --> 42:55.760]  Estuary Ruiz?
[42:55.760 --> 42:56.740]  I don't know, but the way you said it
[42:56.740 --> 42:57.460]  sounded really cool.
[42:57.480 --> 42:57.880]  Isn't that right?
[42:58.500 --> 42:58.680]  Yeah.
[42:58.760 --> 42:59.860]  I think you said it correctly.
[42:59.860 --> 43:00.340]  I think it's Ruiz, yeah.
[43:01.220 --> 43:01.980]  But look at the card.
[43:02.680 --> 43:03.780]  It's like saying, like, little Lily.
[43:04.040 --> 43:05.980]  He's got little, he's got little,
[43:06.340 --> 43:08.660]  he had mitts on his gloves, his little sliding gloves.
[43:08.920 --> 43:09.400]  Little sliders?
[43:09.840 --> 43:10.020]  Yeah.
[43:10.440 --> 43:11.260]  Jazz Chisholm.
[43:11.400 --> 43:12.340]  I don't like them, but they're smart.
[43:12.640 --> 43:13.960]  He just made a mistake and he's like,
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.180]  oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to freak that up.
[43:16.460 --> 43:17.100]  He's jazzed.
[43:17.120 --> 43:17.520]  He's jazzed.
[43:18.240 --> 43:18.880]  That's a show.
[43:19.100 --> 43:20.000]  I'm jazzed, right?
[43:21.160 --> 43:23.260]  Yeah, it comes on after A Thousand Pound Sisters.
[43:23.720 --> 43:24.820]  Tyler Soderstrom.
[43:24.940 --> 43:25.380]  Awesome.
[43:26.860 --> 43:27.740]  Dominic Canzone.
[43:27.980 --> 43:29.360]  If my name was Dominic Canzone,
[43:29.440 --> 43:30.600]  I'd change my name to Calzone.
[43:30.820 --> 43:32.040]  I'd be like, I'm Dominic Calzone.
[43:32.300 --> 43:32.760]  I'm with you.
[43:33.060 --> 43:33.720]  Fulton Carroll, Rookie Cup.
[43:33.820 --> 43:34.220]  That's nice.
[43:34.320 --> 43:35.460]  Is that a variation?
[43:35.860 --> 43:36.260]  New.
[43:36.980 --> 43:38.140]  And then Chris Taylor.
[43:38.460 --> 43:39.800]  Okay, moving along.
[43:40.160 --> 43:41.060]  These aren't...
[43:41.060 --> 43:44.480]  Which thing has been the most value so far, do you think?
[43:47.780 --> 43:49.720]  Maybe that photo card we got.
[43:50.440 --> 43:50.960]  Uh...
[43:52.100 --> 43:53.140]  What else did we get?
[43:53.540 --> 43:54.340]  I don't remember.
[43:54.360 --> 43:55.080]  Home run cards.
[43:55.600 --> 43:56.540]  Oh, you got the Nakey card.
[43:57.220 --> 43:58.020]  The Nakey card.
[43:59.080 --> 44:00.140]  That's probably it, huh?
[44:00.200 --> 44:00.760]  Maybe, yeah.
[44:02.280 --> 44:05.300]  Yuri Perez, Brendan Rogers, Seth Lugo,
[44:05.540 --> 44:08.180]  Ronald Acuna Jr., Emanuel Clase,
[44:08.580 --> 44:11.380]  David Bednor, Miguel Amaya,
[44:11.600 --> 44:13.360]  Clay Holmes, that's the Reds.
[44:13.440 --> 44:17.020]  Flip it over and we've got a foil Logan Allen card.
[44:17.200 --> 44:18.000]  Man, I wish I had rookies.
[44:18.380 --> 44:19.020]  Paul Goldschmidt.
[44:19.580 --> 44:21.440]  Nathaniel Lowe, Victor Medeiros, Pete Alonzo.
[44:21.560 --> 44:22.480]  Not a single...
[44:22.480 --> 44:23.740]  Oh, we got that, we got a...
[44:23.740 --> 44:26.120]  Dogshit stars of the MLB, Ellie Daly-Crews,
[44:26.160 --> 44:27.420]  but I think that's the only one we've got so far.
[44:27.480 --> 44:27.700]  Yeah.
[44:28.320 --> 44:28.760]  Unfortunately.
[44:29.000 --> 44:29.980]  No Jason Dominguez at all.
[44:30.180 --> 44:31.980]  Christian Javier, Nolan Arenado,
[44:34.080 --> 44:34.960]  Gray Kissinger.
[44:35.300 --> 44:36.420]  I wonder if he's related to Henry Kissinger.
[44:36.620 --> 44:36.860]  Yeah.
[44:37.020 --> 44:38.880]  Merrill Kelly, Anthony Volpe,
[44:39.720 --> 44:42.500]  Elias Diaz, Jaron Duran, Sterling Mart...
[44:42.500 --> 44:43.100]  How do you say it?
[44:43.360 --> 44:43.800]  Marte.
[44:44.080 --> 44:45.000]  Sterling Marte.
[44:45.460 --> 44:46.260]  Sterling Marte.
[44:46.380 --> 44:47.000]  Sterling Marte.
[44:47.140 --> 44:47.260]  Excuse me.
[44:47.260 --> 44:47.760]  Three dickheads.
[44:47.760 --> 44:49.020]  Three dickheads.
[44:49.140 --> 44:49.660]  Byron Buxton.
[44:50.060 --> 44:50.700]  Oh, that's cool.
[44:50.820 --> 44:51.220]  That's parallels.
[44:51.640 --> 44:52.420]  Nobody has a year.
[44:52.540 --> 44:54.560]  Gladdy Jr., Bobby Witt Jr.
[44:55.240 --> 44:58.480]  Someone in the chat named Zimmerzone asked,
[44:59.540 --> 45:01.360]  is Clutch My Pearls podcast any good?
[45:01.780 --> 45:02.060]  Nope.
[45:02.340 --> 45:03.460]  Nope, fucking sucks.
[45:03.620 --> 45:04.460]  Yeah, I'd skip it.
[45:04.580 --> 45:04.720]  I don't know what they're doing.
[45:05.260 --> 45:07.000]  But you should still like and subscribe and listen,
[45:07.180 --> 45:08.720]  leave a review and all that stuff.
[45:08.960 --> 45:11.700]  And you know, when we have a Patreon, like, what's up?
[45:11.740 --> 45:13.820]  This also isn't any good, what we're doing.
[45:14.480 --> 45:15.560]  I thought it'd be like this.
[45:15.660 --> 45:16.380]  But you're here.
[45:16.560 --> 45:17.060]  You're here.
[45:17.060 --> 45:17.900]  You fucking dummy.
[45:17.920 --> 45:20.180]  Dave Meyers, Miguel Waka, Sal Freelick.
[45:20.280 --> 45:21.920]  Wait, wait, don't just blow through the Padre.
[45:22.180 --> 45:23.660]  Oh, I'm sorry, hold on, let's go back.
[45:24.940 --> 45:25.620]  Miguel Waka.
[45:25.960 --> 45:26.660]  Michael Waka.
[45:26.740 --> 45:26.960]  Waka, Waka.
[45:27.120 --> 45:27.420]  Thank you.
[45:27.420 --> 45:27.860]  Michael Waka.
[45:28.180 --> 45:28.680]  Thank you.
[45:28.920 --> 45:32.660]  Right, Ryan Nelson, It's the Angels.
[45:32.660 --> 45:33.440]  I'm sitting up.
[45:33.780 --> 45:35.100]  Adley Rutschman.
[45:35.260 --> 45:36.100]  I keep moving around.
[45:36.260 --> 45:37.820]  Ooh, look at that one.
[45:37.860 --> 45:38.360]  You like them.
[45:38.580 --> 45:39.200]  Look at it.
[45:39.380 --> 45:42.560]  I like how all of their Padre cards,
[45:42.620 --> 45:44.320]  or most of them that I've noticed,
[45:45.240 --> 45:46.640]  have the cool, like...
[45:46.640 --> 45:48.360]  I love them.
[45:48.600 --> 45:50.400]  I didn't like the City Connect when it came out.
[45:50.580 --> 45:52.240]  And then as more City Connects came out,
[45:52.320 --> 45:53.620]  I liked it because at least it's something.
[45:53.820 --> 45:57.760]  Well, it's like the Spurs will do that colorway sometimes.
[45:58.680 --> 45:59.400]  And then...
[45:59.400 --> 46:01.980]  I showed Gus a picture of the creature dressed like Batman.
[46:02.520 --> 46:03.140]  Oh, gosh.
[46:03.780 --> 46:04.760]  Does that happen a lot?
[46:04.860 --> 46:05.700]  Do they do that intentionally?
[46:05.800 --> 46:06.300]  Is it a bit?
[46:06.660 --> 46:08.080]  No, it's when a bat comes into the arena.
[46:08.080 --> 46:09.100]  I know, but it happens enough
[46:09.100 --> 46:10.680]  that he's able to put his little costume on.
[46:10.720 --> 46:12.040]  I've just seen it a couple of times, you know?
[46:12.180 --> 46:14.340]  I think maybe there's a lot of bats in San Antonio.
[46:14.540 --> 46:15.960]  We're gonna see the creature in March.
[46:15.960 --> 46:16.780]  Yeah, I've heard.
[46:16.960 --> 46:17.980]  Oh, Jackson.
[46:18.300 --> 46:18.980]  That's a cool one.
[46:19.100 --> 46:19.500]  That's cool.
[46:19.600 --> 46:20.360]  80-pound throwback.
[46:20.820 --> 46:22.200]  Henry Davis stars the MLB.
[46:22.280 --> 46:22.900]  That's nice.
[46:23.540 --> 46:25.740]  Sidane Raffaella, Jonathan Indian, Bruce...
[46:26.180 --> 46:27.320]  I saw a Wemby.
[46:27.480 --> 46:30.680]  Have you seen the Wemby billboard on I-35?
[46:31.020 --> 46:31.440]  No.
[46:31.720 --> 46:33.260]  He has his arms stretched out
[46:33.260 --> 46:35.140]  with HEV bags all along them.
[46:35.140 --> 46:35.380]  Oh, that's cool.
[46:35.440 --> 46:36.920]  Oh, I can see how many HEV bags I am.
[46:36.940 --> 46:37.120]  Yeah.
[46:37.340 --> 46:38.420]  I'm 13 ice creams.
[46:38.820 --> 46:39.060]  Yeah.
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.360]  You gotta be at least 15 ice creams to be in the NBA.
[46:42.540 --> 46:43.320]  Yeah, you need to be.
[46:43.960 --> 46:45.820]  Matt McClain, Curtis Meade.
[46:46.440 --> 46:47.400]  Wonder if he...
[46:47.400 --> 46:49.120]  It's one of those dudes that makes his own Meade
[46:49.120 --> 46:49.800]  because it's his name.
[46:49.880 --> 46:50.460]  Because it's his name?
[46:50.560 --> 46:51.080]  He has to?
[46:51.160 --> 46:51.420]  Yeah, I would do that.
[46:51.860 --> 46:56.280]  Abner Uribe, Griffin Caning, Joe Musgrove.
[46:56.300 --> 46:56.880]  There you go.
[46:57.240 --> 46:59.760]  Holton Couser, Kyle Freeland.
[47:00.100 --> 47:02.420]  Ooh, Ronnie Mauricio, Ricky.
[47:02.500 --> 47:03.300]  That's cool.
[47:03.920 --> 47:06.100]  So that Kyle Freeland card right there?
[47:06.240 --> 47:06.480]  Yeah.
[47:06.560 --> 47:07.680]  That's the one that you got?
[47:07.900 --> 47:08.300]  That's the one.
[47:08.420 --> 47:08.760]  There you go.
[47:08.840 --> 47:09.820]  Thank you so much.
[47:10.020 --> 47:11.200]  So that's what the normal one looks like.
[47:11.200 --> 47:12.080]  That's like the third time
[47:12.080 --> 47:13.480]  we've seen this specific card.
[47:13.620 --> 47:14.980]  Well, he's all wrapped up in here.
[47:15.300 --> 47:15.760]  I'll nake him.
[47:15.760 --> 47:16.160]  Yeah, it's okay.
[47:16.280 --> 47:16.540]  It's okay.
[47:16.660 --> 47:19.020]  But yeah, so that's what it normally looks like.
[47:19.020 --> 47:19.180]  Cool.
[47:19.920 --> 47:20.640]  Ryan Geoffers.
[47:20.880 --> 47:22.340]  It's like turning the HUD off in a video game.
[47:22.480 --> 47:22.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[47:22.900 --> 47:23.260]  That's neat.
[47:23.720 --> 47:23.840]  Yeah.
[47:24.060 --> 47:24.520]  My head.
[47:25.060 --> 47:25.720]  Heads up this way.
[47:25.740 --> 47:26.780]  Heads up this way.
[47:27.060 --> 47:29.500]  Speaking of, your car has that and I fucking hate it.
[47:29.600 --> 47:30.780]  I cannot pay attention.
[47:31.240 --> 47:32.600]  I just stare at it.
[47:32.880 --> 47:33.860]  Did you fuck with it recently?
[47:34.180 --> 47:34.840]  No, did I?
[47:35.080 --> 47:35.440]  Maybe.
[47:35.720 --> 47:36.120]  A little bit.
[47:37.140 --> 47:38.940]  I think I felt where it was
[47:38.940 --> 47:40.860]  to see if I could put my finger over it
[47:40.860 --> 47:41.600]  while I was driving.
[47:41.600 --> 47:43.120]  I think you moved it out of place.
[47:44.300 --> 47:44.880]  When you drive...
[47:44.880 --> 47:46.040]  I got out of my car and I was like,
[47:46.100 --> 47:48.480]  why is my, why is my thing, why is my, it looks weird.
[47:48.620 --> 47:50.880]  It's like projected onto the windshield.
[47:51.260 --> 47:52.520]  Like your speed and all that shit.
[47:52.640 --> 47:53.940]  So it feels like you're in a video game,
[47:53.960 --> 47:54.720]  but I didn't like it.
[47:55.200 --> 47:56.080]  So I moved it.
[47:56.280 --> 47:56.960]  Well, I didn't know if I,
[47:57.000 --> 47:58.200]  I think I was just trying to feel like...
[47:58.200 --> 47:58.800]  And now it's back for you too.
[47:58.880 --> 47:59.580]  I think I was trying to,
[47:59.620 --> 48:00.880]  I couldn't find a button for it.
[48:00.920 --> 48:02.520]  So I was feeling around thinking
[48:02.520 --> 48:04.220]  maybe if I put a piece of paper or something
[48:04.220 --> 48:04.840]  in front of it.
[48:04.840 --> 48:05.620]  Oh my God.
[48:05.920 --> 48:06.600]  But then I didn't.
[48:06.700 --> 48:07.460]  And then I was like, oh, I guess I'll just...
[48:07.460 --> 48:08.180]  Just live with it.
[48:08.180 --> 48:09.080]  Drive distracted.
[48:09.300 --> 48:10.400]  It tells you what the speed limit is
[48:10.400 --> 48:11.320]  and how fast you're going.
[48:11.440 --> 48:11.880]  I don't even know.
[48:11.980 --> 48:12.780]  It's just like down here.
[48:13.560 --> 48:15.140]  It's like, anyways.
[48:16.440 --> 48:17.460]  Faggot James Challenge.
[48:17.460 --> 48:17.640]  Thank you.
[48:18.620 --> 48:20.000]  Faggot and then a dickhead.
[48:20.240 --> 48:21.680]  Cause I got in my car today to drive
[48:21.680 --> 48:23.100]  and I thought, what is wrong?
[48:23.300 --> 48:24.040]  Something's weird.
[48:24.200 --> 48:25.500]  And I'm like looking left and right.
[48:25.540 --> 48:27.440]  I can't figure out, something's different.
[48:27.700 --> 48:29.200]  I thought, ah, you're losing your fucking mind.
[48:29.260 --> 48:29.800]  I guess I'm not.
[48:29.900 --> 48:30.420]  I guess I'm not.
[48:30.520 --> 48:30.960]  Mike Trout.
[48:31.000 --> 48:32.060]  Faggot Mike Trout.
[48:32.060 --> 48:34.580]  David, David, David, David, David, David, David, David.
[48:34.580 --> 48:34.940]  Reester.
[48:35.520 --> 48:36.040]  Amazing win.
[48:36.140 --> 48:36.920]  And then throwback.
[48:37.060 --> 48:37.740]  Here's a Mike Trout.
[48:37.820 --> 48:38.680]  Stars the MLB.
[48:39.320 --> 48:40.760]  So those cards aren't really anything.
[48:40.760 --> 48:41.520]  Max Muncy.
[48:41.720 --> 48:42.440]  He's your favorite baseball player.
[48:42.460 --> 48:42.860]  These are...
[48:43.340 --> 48:44.120]  The Stars the MLB.
[48:44.320 --> 48:46.280]  Now, the foil ones are worth a little bit more.
[48:46.460 --> 48:47.440]  The base one's not.
[48:47.520 --> 48:47.880]  Got it.
[48:48.560 --> 48:51.120]  Maybe if the rookies...
[48:51.120 --> 48:51.700]  Mass win.
[48:52.160 --> 48:52.880]  Mass win win.
[48:53.620 --> 48:54.120]  Oh yeah.
[48:54.260 --> 48:56.220]  I wonder if he's related to...
[48:56.220 --> 48:56.600]  A mouse.
[48:56.600 --> 48:57.180]  It's not spelled the same.
[48:57.500 --> 48:57.760]  No.
[48:58.400 --> 48:58.800]  Steven.
[48:59.060 --> 49:00.680]  Base win do is what I was going to say, but...
[49:00.680 --> 49:01.140]  That's cool.
[49:02.280 --> 49:04.480]  That'd be cool if there was like a one-of-one on these.
[49:04.520 --> 49:05.480]  I can't open this.
[49:05.640 --> 49:07.940]  So you have two challenges.
[49:08.520 --> 49:09.700]  Elites of the game.
[49:09.860 --> 49:10.720]  Mookie and Shohei.
[49:10.920 --> 49:11.400]  Look at that.
[49:12.300 --> 49:13.100]  Tarek Skubel.
[49:13.400 --> 49:14.420]  I have three at home, too.
[49:15.180 --> 49:16.260]  I gotta sit down and do it.
[49:16.320 --> 49:17.440]  Rowdy Tellez.
[49:18.380 --> 49:19.180]  Luis Matos.
[49:19.580 --> 49:20.300]  Tyler O'Neal.
[49:20.520 --> 49:22.500]  Carmen Mlodzinski.
[49:22.900 --> 49:23.600]  That just rolls off the tongue.
[49:24.340 --> 49:25.140]  Christian Walker.
[49:26.740 --> 49:27.540]  Alex Bregman.
[49:27.800 --> 49:28.780]  Celebration of the Kid.
[49:29.000 --> 49:29.880]  Back when it was...
[49:29.880 --> 49:31.380]  Infamous White Sox days.
[49:31.380 --> 49:32.940]  Don't remember that at all.
[49:33.080 --> 49:33.260]  Yep.
[49:33.760 --> 49:35.480]  Henry Davis, the very tail end of his career.
[49:35.660 --> 49:36.340]  This might be nice.
[49:37.300 --> 49:37.940]  Jordan Lawler.
[49:38.080 --> 49:39.180]  I think it might've been the last team he played for.
[49:40.360 --> 49:42.240]  Alec Marsh, Joey Votto, Zach Wheeler.
[49:43.800 --> 49:46.780]  When he was in his brief journeyman phase of his career.
[49:47.480 --> 49:49.160]  I realized why I think I like,
[49:49.340 --> 49:51.120]  when I think of Greg Maddox, I think of him as a cub.
[49:51.200 --> 49:52.140]  I think of him as a brave.
[49:52.520 --> 49:53.660]  Because I'm a little older than you.
[49:54.580 --> 49:56.440]  And it's right around the time I started watching baseball.
[49:56.840 --> 49:58.780]  I think 86, 87 was his rookie year.
[49:59.120 --> 49:59.940]  And he was a cub.
[49:59.940 --> 50:01.460]  He played for the Cubs for six years.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.740]  And so my first introduction to him was as a cub.
[50:03.780 --> 50:04.200]  I get it.
[50:05.920 --> 50:06.640]  Andy Ibanez.
[50:06.720 --> 50:08.040]  Are you familiar with Casey and JoJo?
[50:08.440 --> 50:08.640]  Yeah.
[50:09.120 --> 50:11.100]  Geoff and I played that All My Life song.
[50:11.100 --> 50:11.700]  All My Life, yeah.
[50:11.860 --> 50:12.880]  Geoff had never heard it before.
[50:13.140 --> 50:13.740]  That's insane.
[50:13.780 --> 50:15.620]  That song was inescapable in the nineties.
[50:16.140 --> 50:17.640]  That's the song that I sang that,
[50:18.260 --> 50:19.360]  said his name, The Child.
[50:19.600 --> 50:25.500]  I don't think I turned on a radio from like 18 to 35.
[50:25.700 --> 50:27.060]  You can say the name.
[50:27.060 --> 50:28.320]  But the audience doesn't know.
[50:28.320 --> 50:29.280]  They think they know.
[50:29.840 --> 50:31.000]  It doesn't come out till Wednesday.
[50:31.240 --> 50:31.460]  Yeah.
[50:31.620 --> 50:31.860]  Yeah.
[50:32.060 --> 50:34.180]  Oh, so you're going to keep it till Wednesday.
[50:34.220 --> 50:36.000]  Well, I mean, don't you want them to find out
[50:36.000 --> 50:36.600]  when they find out?
[50:36.660 --> 50:40.300]  They think they know, but like the real world, you don't.
[50:41.180 --> 50:42.420]  You have no idea.
[50:43.020 --> 50:43.500]  Bryce Harper.
[50:43.700 --> 50:44.200]  You think you know.
[50:44.200 --> 50:44.700]  Sure, sure.
[50:44.700 --> 50:46.120]  But you have no idea.
[50:46.340 --> 50:47.360]  It's just getting real.
[50:47.560 --> 50:48.520]  Also it's...
[50:48.520 --> 50:49.000]  Ha Sung Kim.
[50:49.300 --> 50:49.620]  Ha Sung Kim?
[50:49.820 --> 50:50.140]  Yeah.
[50:51.300 --> 50:52.400]  How does that...
[50:52.400 --> 50:53.980]  It was in the season against the Dodgers in Korea.
[50:54.580 --> 50:57.080]  Do you think that your little doggie would like that toy?
[50:57.460 --> 50:59.680]  He would chew the ears off of it and then rip it open
[50:59.680 --> 51:00.860]  and then tear all the stuff out.
[51:01.080 --> 51:02.160]  That's why I gave one to Gracie,
[51:02.260 --> 51:02.960]  so she can give it to Cinnamon
[51:02.960 --> 51:04.760]  and Cinnamon can just lay next to it.
[51:04.840 --> 51:05.560]  It's a cool card.
[51:05.740 --> 51:06.760]  Well, it's Cinnamon Cutlet.
[51:07.720 --> 51:10.540]  I think that needs to be in the promo photos for it.
[51:10.540 --> 51:10.800]  Cinnamon.
[51:11.440 --> 51:12.600]  It's a cinnamon roll.
[51:15.940 --> 51:16.660]  Jose Ramirez.
[51:16.780 --> 51:17.800]  Why isn't Cinnamon here?
[51:18.260 --> 51:21.140]  This is not the best photo of Tom Seaver.
[51:21.200 --> 51:22.040]  That's awful.
[51:22.300 --> 51:23.580]  He's like, I don't want to do that to him.
[51:23.740 --> 51:24.960]  I'm Tom Seaver, guys.
[51:26.240 --> 51:27.080]  Juan Soto.
[51:27.420 --> 51:28.920]  Oh, that was cool.
[51:29.100 --> 51:31.040]  Jordan Westberg, Eduardo Rodriguez.
[51:32.020 --> 51:33.240]  Do you have the box for this?
[51:33.240 --> 51:35.960]  Juan Soto, he doesn't play for San Diego.
[51:35.960 --> 51:38.060]  No, we traded him to the Yankees.
[51:38.720 --> 51:39.300]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:39.340 --> 51:41.260]  Because he was not going to sign an extension with anyone.
[51:41.480 --> 51:42.720]  He's a Boris guy.
[51:45.840 --> 51:48.260]  This guy and that guy and this guy.
[51:48.300 --> 51:49.620]  Don't skip over the Padre.
[51:49.700 --> 51:50.400]  What are you doing?
[51:51.280 --> 51:53.100]  And then, there you go.
[51:53.140 --> 51:53.620]  Thank you.
[51:53.680 --> 51:54.360]  Matt Waldron.
[51:54.360 --> 51:56.520]  You got that one in a different parallel.
[51:57.280 --> 52:02.080]  Bryce Holder, Joey Wymer, Marco Luciano, 89 throwback rookie.
[52:03.340 --> 52:06.540]  Ronnie Mauricio, Tyler Sotostream again.
[52:07.040 --> 52:08.480]  Daniel and Trent Grisham.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.560]  Yeah, he's also a New York Yankee.
[52:11.960 --> 52:12.260]  Is he really?
[52:12.400 --> 52:13.800]  Yeah, he's part of the Soto trade.
[52:14.340 --> 52:15.820]  What did y'all get from the Yankees?
[52:15.960 --> 52:16.420]  Bunch of pictures.
[52:16.820 --> 52:18.080]  Michael King and a few other guys.
[52:18.860 --> 52:21.220]  I think it's gonna help us where we need it.
[52:21.460 --> 52:23.720]  And we didn't, Soto doesn't do anything for me.
[52:23.720 --> 52:25.960]  He's like a player, so it's like, you know, it's fine.
[52:26.360 --> 52:27.040]  I don't really care.
[52:27.240 --> 52:29.160]  We also lost that Soto trade, so it doesn't matter.
[52:29.500 --> 52:31.600]  Brian Wu, Spencer Strider.
[52:31.920 --> 52:33.200]  That's our first Spencer Strider today.
[52:33.240 --> 52:33.620]  That's weird.
[52:33.960 --> 52:36.040]  And it's in the Brave City Connect, too.
[52:36.120 --> 52:39.320]  Yeah, Jordan Romano, JT Real Muto.
[52:40.060 --> 52:41.420]  Do they only wear those at home games?
[52:41.440 --> 52:42.040]  Will Brennan.
[52:42.380 --> 52:44.360]  Yeah, they wear them at home, but not always.
[52:44.500 --> 52:44.940]  It's just sometimes.
[52:45.060 --> 52:45.420]  Just sometimes.
[52:45.560 --> 52:47.580]  I think they wear them like 12 times a year.
[52:47.700 --> 52:49.900]  Well, in NBA, they wear them 12 times a year.
[52:49.960 --> 52:51.460]  In baseball, it's like pitcher's discretion
[52:51.460 --> 52:52.380]  what uniform they use.
[52:52.380 --> 52:53.680]  A pitcher gets to choose?
[52:53.860 --> 52:54.420]  I think so.
[52:54.500 --> 52:55.260]  Grant Hartwig.
[52:55.440 --> 52:55.760]  Really?
[52:56.200 --> 52:57.820]  But aren't there multiple pitchers a game?
[52:58.740 --> 52:59.580]  The starting pitcher.
[52:59.720 --> 53:00.080]  Tatis.
[53:00.680 --> 53:01.100]  Wow.
[53:01.380 --> 53:02.460]  There he is, the man himself.
[53:02.460 --> 53:03.960]  What other little decisions does he get to make?
[53:04.400 --> 53:05.320]  Would pitch the throw.
[53:06.360 --> 53:06.960]  Well, yeah.
[53:07.640 --> 53:09.220]  If he's picking off a guy at first.
[53:09.640 --> 53:11.320]  Are these sleeve or no sleeve?
[53:11.840 --> 53:12.160]  No sleeve.
[53:12.560 --> 53:13.600]  Just these two are the last sleeve.
[53:15.160 --> 53:18.420]  And then that's the end of the monster box.
[53:18.520 --> 53:18.940]  Is that right?
[53:19.020 --> 53:21.700]  Do you think that it's like a superstitious thing
[53:21.700 --> 53:23.060]  where they're like, I pitch better
[53:23.060 --> 53:24.840]  when we wear this little outfit?
[53:25.140 --> 53:25.440]  It is.
[53:25.860 --> 53:26.360]  That's cool.
[53:26.360 --> 53:27.120]  Yeah, this little outfit.
[53:27.620 --> 53:30.080]  The Padres were on a losing streak wearing their road,
[53:30.420 --> 53:32.620]  I think the brown jersey.
[53:33.080 --> 53:35.340]  And so they would, like you Darvish would pick it
[53:35.340 --> 53:36.560]  and the whole team would like fall apart.
[53:36.640 --> 53:37.760]  It happened like three other times
[53:37.760 --> 53:40.000]  and they stopped wearing them like the rest of the year.
[53:40.180 --> 53:40.300]  Dang.
[53:40.300 --> 53:41.480]  And it's such a good jersey.
[53:41.840 --> 53:43.140]  So they went, they wore like the sand.
[53:43.260 --> 53:44.860]  That's like the classic one.
[53:45.080 --> 53:45.720]  What's wrong, babe?
[53:45.840 --> 53:46.260]  I was just thinking.
[53:46.340 --> 53:47.180]  So here's where we are.
[53:47.220 --> 53:48.320]  We got about five minutes left.
[53:48.400 --> 53:49.760]  I don't want to crack open another box.
[53:50.060 --> 53:50.640]  No, no, no.
[53:50.640 --> 53:51.960]  We've got, here's what we've got left.
[53:52.040 --> 53:53.980]  We've got the mega box.
[53:54.680 --> 53:57.620]  We've got a retail box.
[53:57.760 --> 54:00.280]  We've got the hobby and hobby jumbo.
[54:00.440 --> 54:01.520]  So we'll save those for next week.
[54:01.580 --> 54:02.920]  These are going to be where the money is.
[54:03.260 --> 54:03.780]  Oh, well.
[54:05.340 --> 54:06.000]  What'd you say, babe?
[54:06.280 --> 54:08.440]  Oh, you could probably blast the jumbo one.
[54:08.480 --> 54:09.320]  That's only...
[54:09.320 --> 54:10.300]  No, that's 20 packs.
[54:10.380 --> 54:10.900]  Oh, shit.
[54:11.280 --> 54:11.660]  We don't have that kind of time.
[54:11.920 --> 54:12.540]  But what we can do.
[54:13.140 --> 54:13.460]  Monopoly.
[54:14.340 --> 54:15.380]  Oh, yeah, you do have some.
[54:15.520 --> 54:18.300]  Five minutes left and then Gracie can go home.
[54:18.420 --> 54:19.040]  We'll go...
[54:19.040 --> 54:19.740]  So close.
[54:20.400 --> 54:21.120]  Almost there.
[54:21.260 --> 54:22.880]  Unless you guys want to do like another hour or two.
[54:23.220 --> 54:24.360]  We got the cards for it.
[54:24.380 --> 54:26.120]  I just remembered I have to be anywhere else.
[54:26.260 --> 54:27.820]  I gotta re-curl, clutch my pearls.
[54:28.600 --> 54:29.380]  With your wife.
[54:29.540 --> 54:30.620]  With my small wife.
[54:30.760 --> 54:33.980]  I'll see her for one half hour today.
[54:34.500 --> 54:35.020]  How cute are these?
[54:36.000 --> 54:36.620]  Very excited.
[54:38.480 --> 54:39.200]  Great parallels.
[54:39.280 --> 54:39.880]  You want a Wemby?
[54:40.300 --> 54:40.940]  Yeah, I want a Wemby.
[54:41.020 --> 54:41.900]  Or any Celtics.
[54:41.980 --> 54:42.680]  I think it's going to be a nice one.
[54:42.680 --> 54:43.800]  Brandon Miller, bass rookie.
[54:44.200 --> 54:44.840]  There we go.
[54:45.800 --> 54:46.320]  That's good.
[54:46.900 --> 54:48.240]  Jalen Brown, there you go.
[54:48.820 --> 54:49.780]  SGA, Purple Wave.
[54:50.060 --> 54:50.780]  That's nice.
[54:51.620 --> 54:53.740]  So we'll sleeve those Emily, if you wouldn't mind.
[54:54.160 --> 54:54.520]  Oh yeah.
[54:54.860 --> 54:55.400]  Thank you.
[54:55.700 --> 54:56.140]  All of them?
[54:56.280 --> 54:58.160]  Actually yeah, sleeve the case rolls too.
[54:58.180 --> 54:58.660]  Let me know when we do.
[54:58.680 --> 55:00.120]  I'm going to choose what order you go in.
[55:00.500 --> 55:01.080]  I like that.
[55:01.960 --> 55:03.180]  Jordan Hawkins, bass rookie.
[55:03.260 --> 55:04.140]  Nick Smith, bass rookie.
[55:04.360 --> 55:05.820]  Chet, year two card.
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.340]  And a Kobe Bufkin, Purple Wave rookie.
[55:08.440 --> 55:09.140]  That's nice.
[55:09.360 --> 55:10.900]  Okay, this one has good stuff in it.
[55:11.040 --> 55:12.020]  So we'll sleeve that one.
[55:12.040 --> 55:14.020]  I think it's crazy that guys that are playing
[55:14.020 --> 55:15.800]  in the league now are named after Kobe Bryant.
[55:16.600 --> 55:16.960]  Crazy.
[55:17.480 --> 55:17.660]  Crazy.
[55:18.040 --> 55:20.020]  Are there any named LeBron yet?
[55:20.440 --> 55:20.980]  No, not yet.
[55:21.500 --> 55:22.560]  There will be.
[55:23.380 --> 55:23.740]  Tatum.
[55:23.740 --> 55:24.040]  Tatum.
[55:24.100 --> 55:27.900]  Bass, Anthony Black, Aaron Gordon, and Jimmy Butler.
[55:28.600 --> 55:29.260]  We'll sleeve that.
[55:29.940 --> 55:30.660]  Jimmy Buckets.
[55:31.000 --> 55:31.340]  Tatum.
[55:31.520 --> 55:31.740]  Yeah.
[55:31.940 --> 55:32.600]  These are sleeves.
[55:32.760 --> 55:33.060]  Is that it?
[55:33.220 --> 55:33.620]  Or there's more?
[55:33.640 --> 55:35.420]  No, well, okay, do this one now.
[55:35.580 --> 55:36.100]  Okay, thank you.
[55:36.240 --> 55:36.700]  I like it.
[55:42.770 --> 55:43.890]  Never heard that song.
[55:44.310 --> 55:44.890]  Does like...
[55:44.890 --> 55:45.770]  What, did you just make that up?
[55:46.030 --> 55:46.950]  Blasting it yesterday.
[55:47.410 --> 55:48.790]  Anytime she sings a song...
[55:48.790 --> 55:48.910]  Is that LeBron James?
[55:49.190 --> 55:49.970]  Yeah, LeBron.
[55:50.250 --> 55:50.910]  LeBron James?
[55:50.930 --> 55:52.750]  Anytime she sings a song that I've never heard,
[55:52.890 --> 55:54.650]  I'm like, oh, it must have been a popular song that I missed.
[55:55.270 --> 55:56.310]  What was it?
[55:56.410 --> 55:57.730]  And I just had never heard that one.
[55:58.190 --> 55:58.330]  Weird.
[55:58.330 --> 56:03.390]  My song for Henry was the Diana Ross
[56:03.390 --> 56:05.950]  and Lionel Richie song, the Endless Love song.
[56:06.030 --> 56:06.770]  Nice, that's good.
[56:07.150 --> 56:08.290]  Sing both parts to him.
[56:08.770 --> 56:10.030]  James Harden bass.
[56:10.750 --> 56:12.070]  Jamal Murray bass.
[56:13.170 --> 56:14.970]  Jose Ochoa-Lambeed bass.
[56:14.970 --> 56:16.850]  And then...
[56:18.690 --> 56:19.930]  Good, everyone good?
[56:19.970 --> 56:25.090]  Numbered to 500, this is Pascal Siakam Gold Mojo,
[56:28.150 --> 56:29.550]  maybe is what that would be called.
[56:29.610 --> 56:30.390]  Gold Mojo, probably.
[56:31.310 --> 56:32.630]  That's a gorgeous card.
[56:33.310 --> 56:35.490]  I mean, it's numbered, which is cool.
[56:36.670 --> 56:37.610]  Not super rare.
[56:38.630 --> 56:40.010]  That's gonna have the good one in it.
[56:40.090 --> 56:41.010]  This is gonna have the Wimby?
[56:41.310 --> 56:41.550]  Yeah.
[56:41.930 --> 56:43.970]  We'll open one more box before we're done, I bet.

[57:01.970 --> 57:04.190]  Blast them like they do on the breaks that we watch.
[57:04.390 --> 57:05.430]  And then Gracie can go home.

[58:02.050 --> 58:04.050]  Jalen Brunson, Joel Embiid,
[58:04.430 --> 58:06.410]  Jordan, worst contract in the NBA pool.
[58:06.410 --> 58:07.310]  Yeah, that's my guy!
[58:08.090 --> 58:09.310]  What's wrong with his contract?
[58:09.590 --> 58:10.090]  He just...
[58:10.090 --> 58:10.650]  Well, he sucks.
[58:10.650 --> 58:11.890]  He got punched, now he can't play basketball.
[58:12.030 --> 58:12.550]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[58:12.790 --> 58:13.730]  Pascal Siakam, base.
[58:13.730 --> 58:14.690]  Is he the one that Draymond punched?

[58:31.050 --> 58:34.350]  So you're asking, is he the one that Draymond punched?
[58:34.650 --> 58:37.590]  And yes, but not in what you're thinking of, probably.
[58:37.790 --> 58:38.990]  This was a different time.
[58:38.990 --> 58:41.730]  Not the guy who Draymond punched last year in practice.
[58:42.110 --> 58:42.630]  That's something different.
[58:42.850 --> 58:44.470]  Oh, okay, so you were thinking of in practice
[58:44.470 --> 58:45.630]  and not the one in the game.

[58:48.570 --> 58:51.250]  No, the one that he kind of slammed against the wall,
[58:51.330 --> 58:53.310]  but then the team was kind of okay with it
[58:53.310 --> 58:54.950]  because they were like, I mean, he kind of sucks.
[58:55.230 --> 58:57.050]  Yeah, they went, all right, get rid of him.
[58:57.390 --> 58:57.830]  That's fine.
