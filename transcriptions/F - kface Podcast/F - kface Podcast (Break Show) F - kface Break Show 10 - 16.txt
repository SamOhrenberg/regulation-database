[00:13.000 --> 00:17.260]  Hello and welcome to another F*** Face Break Show.
[00:17.480 --> 00:23.100]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, almost always, Eric and Emily.
[00:23.480 --> 00:25.620]  One of them is lovely. You can pick.
[00:27.480 --> 00:28.300]  What the f***?
[00:28.780 --> 00:31.220]  What? One of you is lovely. I'm not going to say which.
[00:31.480 --> 00:32.120]  Come on, man.
[00:32.860 --> 00:34.340]  It's a subjective thing.
[00:34.500 --> 00:35.620]  Starting out rough.
[00:37.940 --> 00:41.240]  Welcome to another episode. We have got a lot of fun stuff for you today.
[00:41.240 --> 00:45.080]  I think the big thing we're going to open up at the end of the day is this Hit Parade mini helmet.
[00:45.240 --> 00:46.720]  I've never opened a mini helmet before.
[00:47.440 --> 00:49.600]  I've never seen... I've never touched a mini helmet.
[00:49.800 --> 00:51.500]  No. So we have some stuff.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.140]  We're utilizing budget.
[00:53.660 --> 00:56.020]  And Gracie, who's producing, is doing a great job.
[00:56.580 --> 01:00.100]  We have some stuff that we're kind of like sitting on and waiting on.
[01:00.180 --> 01:01.700]  We have like a... there's like a bat?
[01:02.360 --> 01:03.000]  There's a ball?
[01:03.200 --> 01:05.300]  Yeah, we're going to do... we're going to dole it out week to week.
[01:05.320 --> 01:08.140]  But like this helmet, I'm really excited for today.
[01:08.340 --> 01:09.680]  Is this how we're going to end the show today?
[01:09.680 --> 01:12.200]  That's how we're going to end the show with this helmet, I think.
[01:12.320 --> 01:14.660]  And since it's the playoffs, we're going to hope that we get a playoff.
[01:15.060 --> 01:15.980]  Who do you hope?
[01:15.980 --> 01:16.520]  We get a playoff player.
[01:16.620 --> 01:17.560]  Who do you hope it is?
[01:18.100 --> 01:18.680]  Corbin Carroll.
[01:20.300 --> 01:22.720]  Do you think it'll be... is that a new player or an older player?
[01:22.720 --> 01:23.500]  Yeah, he's a new player.
[01:23.720 --> 01:26.800]  Who... what would be like the coolest thing you could get?
[01:26.820 --> 01:27.240]  Babe Ruth.
[01:27.520 --> 01:29.800]  Yeah, but he wouldn't sign this. This didn't exist when he was alive.
[01:29.900 --> 01:30.220]  Correct.
[01:30.540 --> 01:31.240]  But like...
[01:31.240 --> 01:32.320]  That's why it would be so cool.
[01:32.360 --> 01:33.620]  That would be so interesting.
[01:36.900 --> 01:37.800]  Shohei would be cool.
[01:38.220 --> 01:39.960]  Yeah, I mean, that's a current player.
[01:40.500 --> 01:41.220]  Old player.
[01:41.400 --> 01:42.240]  John Kruk.
[01:44.340 --> 01:45.400]  Who makes sausages?
[01:45.560 --> 01:47.240]  Oh, I want nails.
[01:48.200 --> 01:48.560]  Nails?
[01:48.880 --> 01:51.700]  Yeah, I want... what's his name? Played for the Phillies.
[01:52.180 --> 01:53.960]  Calls in Howard Stern all the time. Doesn't have front teeth.
[01:55.680 --> 01:56.040]  Dykstra.
[01:56.220 --> 01:56.960]  Yeah, Lenny Dykstra.
[01:57.060 --> 01:57.960]  I want Lenny Dykstra.
[01:58.180 --> 01:59.680]  That's who we want. We're looking for Lenny Dykstra.
[01:59.760 --> 02:01.540]  He's the one that does Hollywood Squares with them sometimes?
[02:01.780 --> 02:02.140]  Yeah.
[02:03.140 --> 02:06.440]  He does Hollywood Squares with them and a lot of, I think, meth without them.
[02:06.440 --> 02:06.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:09.200 --> 02:14.280]  Anyway, but before we get to it, now that we're back in the swing of things and we weren't coming in from out of town,
[02:14.700 --> 02:22.060]  I have last week's cards that I can go ahead and show you the values of so that we can do our little recap of the hits that we had.
[02:22.800 --> 02:24.140]  I'm obviously not going to show them all.
[02:24.620 --> 02:25.860]  I really want to.
[02:25.960 --> 02:26.300]  Got it.
[02:26.360 --> 02:28.100]  But I'm going to show you the ones that are worth looking at.
[02:28.120 --> 02:28.540]  Here we go.
[02:28.620 --> 02:33.320]  Here we have a Blue Velocity, Scotty Barnes, Optic Ricky Terrell.
[02:33.660 --> 02:34.020]  Oh.
[02:34.760 --> 02:35.340]  There you go.
[02:38.340 --> 02:39.820]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:40.220 --> 02:42.100]  That Blue Velocity is really popping.
[02:42.200 --> 02:43.960]  He was making before we started.
[02:44.140 --> 02:45.540]  I got to adjust this picture.
[02:46.440 --> 02:47.880]  This is like perfectly straight.
[02:47.980 --> 02:48.700]  We put a card game.
[02:48.920 --> 02:49.480]  That's shit.
[02:50.640 --> 02:53.160]  So this is a decent parallel.
[02:53.340 --> 02:54.740]  You want to get a rookie parallel.
[02:55.240 --> 02:56.680]  Optic is a good brand to have.
[02:56.800 --> 03:01.780]  Scotty Barnes was runner-up for Rookie of the Year, I believe, that year.
[03:02.240 --> 03:04.020]  And he's worth $5.
[03:04.460 --> 03:05.420]  He's cooled off.
[03:05.420 --> 03:06.620]  He's cooled off quite a bit.
[03:06.620 --> 03:06.800]  Yeah.
[03:06.800 --> 03:08.840]  After a middling second year.
[03:09.300 --> 03:12.260]  Here we have the Victor Wiminyama Allen and Ginter base card.
[03:12.380 --> 03:12.640]  Hell yeah.
[03:12.780 --> 03:14.820]  This is actually going for about $10 right now.
[03:14.980 --> 03:17.960]  It was going for it in the $20s earlier, but a few have flooded the market.
[03:18.220 --> 03:21.000]  Here we got Tom Sandoval, everybody's favorite Vanderpump Roll guy.
[03:21.200 --> 03:24.280]  Everybody wants to date and have a relationship with Tom Sandoval.
[03:24.380 --> 03:25.240]  He's definitely trustworthy.
[03:25.480 --> 03:26.700]  I like his band.
[03:27.060 --> 03:27.800]  They are good.
[03:28.340 --> 03:29.340]  He's a good band.
[03:29.560 --> 03:30.480]  He's a...
[03:30.480 --> 03:30.720]  Bye.
[03:33.380 --> 03:34.320]  We got these.
[03:34.400 --> 03:35.520]  These were from the RIP card.
[03:35.540 --> 03:35.760]  Oh, yeah.
[03:35.760 --> 03:37.240]  The Griffey Jr. and the Chris Bryant.
[03:37.540 --> 03:37.660]  Yep.
[03:38.080 --> 03:38.520]  I...
[03:38.520 --> 03:38.620]  Fuck.
[03:39.660 --> 03:40.520]  They're mini cards.
[03:40.940 --> 03:41.740]  They're parallels.
[03:42.060 --> 03:46.280]  I couldn't find anything close to a comp on the Chris Bryant, but I think the Griffey Jr.
[03:46.320 --> 03:47.320]  is going to run you about $25.
[03:47.720 --> 03:47.900]  Yeah.
[03:48.120 --> 03:48.480]  All right.
[03:48.700 --> 03:49.140]  This...
[03:49.140 --> 03:50.060]  More difficulty.
[03:50.340 --> 03:52.400]  The Pieces of the Past sitting bowl.
[03:52.580 --> 03:52.740]  What the fuck?
[03:53.520 --> 03:54.280]  Parallel, I have.
[03:54.960 --> 03:55.400]  Parallel!
[03:57.180 --> 03:57.900]  About $20.
[03:58.420 --> 03:58.740]  About $20.
[03:59.180 --> 04:01.360]  Do you think that's like a Running River parallel?
[04:02.200 --> 04:03.080]  Just like...
[04:03.660 --> 04:04.600]  Because it's like a squiggle.
[04:05.200 --> 04:05.960]  Depends on...
[04:05.960 --> 04:09.260]  They have different names depending on who the publisher is, so I don't know.
[04:09.480 --> 04:10.660]  Oh, is that Isaac Newton Crackdice?
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.600]  Yeah, we got Isaac Newton and Louis Pasteur Gold and Blue Foil.
[04:14.800 --> 04:16.180]  These will both run you about a dollar.
[04:16.440 --> 04:16.720]  But they are parallel.
[04:16.720 --> 04:17.300]  These are...
[04:17.300 --> 04:19.120]  These are the funniest cards.
[04:19.340 --> 04:19.580]  I know.
[04:19.780 --> 04:20.600]  I fucking love them.
[04:20.940 --> 04:22.300]  I threw this in here...
[04:22.300 --> 04:22.900]  God damn it.
[04:23.280 --> 04:26.740]  This is Anthony Edwards Optic Rookie Base.
[04:27.460 --> 04:28.280]  This is the...
[04:28.280 --> 04:29.120]  It's a good brand.
[04:29.280 --> 04:31.380]  Optic is one of the three or four that you want to get a rookie card in.
[04:31.380 --> 04:37.980]  Anthony Edwards is probably going to be one of the three or four faces of the league by the time he hits 26 or so.
[04:38.400 --> 04:40.720]  And will be a huge...
[04:40.720 --> 04:45.200]  He's already a huge star, but he will be a top five player by the time it's all said and done.
[04:45.580 --> 04:46.760]  And this is only...
[04:46.760 --> 04:48.700]  To give you an idea how fucking useless base cards are.
[04:48.960 --> 04:49.760]  It's about three bucks.
[04:51.040 --> 04:53.220]  Then we're getting into the autos.
[04:54.100 --> 04:55.380]  So, here we got this...
[04:57.160 --> 04:58.400]  Emily's favorite player, Brooke Lopez.
[04:58.900 --> 04:59.300]  What?
[05:00.720 --> 05:03.300]  He's gotta be somebody's favorite player.
[05:03.500 --> 05:04.540]  Why is he my favorite?
[05:04.800 --> 05:06.000]  I don't know, you always ask me questions.
[05:06.020 --> 05:07.640]  Oh, right. I get him except because he has a twin.
[05:07.860 --> 05:08.600]  Yeah, he does.
[05:09.040 --> 05:11.960]  This is numbered to 10 and an auto.
[05:12.120 --> 05:12.720]  It's a sticker auto.
[05:12.720 --> 05:13.120]  Wow.
[05:13.320 --> 05:13.660]  Recon.
[05:14.540 --> 05:20.000]  I couldn't find an exact comp on this one, but the 299 sold for $15.
[05:20.740 --> 05:20.840]  Dang.
[05:20.980 --> 05:23.620]  The 249 actually only sold for $12.
[05:23.960 --> 05:25.500]  That guy probably undervalued his card.
[05:25.720 --> 05:25.960]  Dang.
[05:25.960 --> 05:30.280]  And a similar number to 10 sticker autos will run you about $50.
[05:30.680 --> 05:30.920]  Wow.
[05:31.480 --> 05:31.800]  Alright.
[05:32.260 --> 05:33.140]  Brianna Stewart.
[05:33.720 --> 05:35.220]  This was the hit I wanted.
[05:35.400 --> 05:35.520]  Yeah.
[05:35.800 --> 05:37.280]  Silver prism auto.
[05:40.320 --> 05:44.820]  If the Liberty can pull themselves out of the tailspin that they are in...
[05:44.820 --> 05:45.560]  It's tough.
[05:45.680 --> 05:48.360]  ...to win the championship, this card will be worth more than it is right now.
[05:48.400 --> 05:49.600]  They're on life support.
[05:49.820 --> 05:53.900]  Thank you, Sabrina Ionescu, last night, who kept them alive.
[05:55.280 --> 05:56.460]  Probably not going to win.
[05:56.460 --> 05:58.400]  It's probably going to be an ISIS championship this year.
[05:58.620 --> 06:00.900]  But regardless, this is $50 or $60.
[06:01.440 --> 06:01.840]  Nice.
[06:02.080 --> 06:05.380]  Which I'm pretty excited about because I really wanted that card and I got it.
[06:06.200 --> 06:10.100]  Everybody's favorite, Sarah Natachany, who was from Camp Camp.
[06:10.500 --> 06:13.440]  This guy and nothing else.
[06:13.760 --> 06:15.620]  This guy will run you about $125.
[06:16.040 --> 06:16.260]  Alright.
[06:17.180 --> 06:18.760]  So that $125 card we got there.
[06:18.900 --> 06:19.220]  Wow.
[06:19.340 --> 06:21.520]  I bet if we called her, we could get her to sign that again.
[06:21.800 --> 06:22.500]  Double sign it?
[06:22.500 --> 06:22.680]  Yeah.
[06:23.220 --> 06:24.360]  Al-K-Line.
[06:24.460 --> 06:25.200]  Oh, cool.
[06:25.200 --> 06:27.920]  This is a stained glass parallel that we pulled out of the rip card.
[06:28.120 --> 06:28.860]  Probably about $40.
[06:29.240 --> 06:29.400]  Okay.
[06:29.680 --> 06:30.240]  That's nice.
[06:30.880 --> 06:32.240]  Then, I wanted to throw...
[06:32.240 --> 06:36.380]  Oh, and then of course, everybody's favorite, Vincent van Gogh relic.
[06:36.980 --> 06:39.240]  I found out we have a lot of Dutch...
[06:40.040 --> 06:40.640]  Oh, really?
[06:40.960 --> 06:42.180]  ...rip show watchers and listeners.
[06:42.360 --> 06:43.360]  We got a lot of emails about it.
[06:43.440 --> 06:43.600]  Huh.
[06:43.820 --> 06:44.660]  A lot of comments about it.
[06:44.840 --> 06:46.360]  This is going to run you...
[06:46.360 --> 06:48.400]  They determined it's in English, what's written here.
[06:48.820 --> 06:50.780]  And this will run you probably $50.
[06:50.780 --> 06:53.160]  Which doesn't seem like enough for Vincent van Gogh.
[06:53.500 --> 06:57.500]  But, hey, if you're looking for your own van Gogh fragment, you can get that for $50.
[06:57.760 --> 06:58.740]  Then I wanted to throw something else in.
[06:58.900 --> 06:59.080]  Okay.
[06:59.160 --> 07:00.880]  Because I had two huge pulls...
[07:00.880 --> 07:01.040]  Yeah.
[07:01.420 --> 07:02.620]  ...in my personal life last week.
[07:02.700 --> 07:02.720]  Okay.
[07:03.580 --> 07:04.460]  And I wanted to show them.
[07:04.680 --> 07:10.340]  At a grocery store, I bought a repackaged thing where it's like two packs of cards for $7.
[07:10.640 --> 07:11.000]  Got it, yeah.
[07:11.140 --> 07:12.480]  And in it, I got this.
[07:12.580 --> 07:13.860]  I thought he got something at the grocery store.
[07:13.960 --> 07:15.280]  He got this at the grocery store.
[07:15.280 --> 07:15.960]  Yeah, I did.
[07:16.200 --> 07:17.860]  This Isaiah Joe rookie card.
[07:18.020 --> 07:19.800]  Isaiah Joe's not a starter.
[07:19.800 --> 07:20.700]  Uh-huh.
[07:20.760 --> 07:23.000]  Not a highly touted young player.
[07:23.120 --> 07:26.100]  So it's got no actual value.
[07:26.180 --> 07:30.740]  But if he were a starter, this numbered to 10.
[07:31.260 --> 07:31.480]  Wow.
[07:31.480 --> 07:33.260]  This rookie would be worth hundreds.
[07:33.620 --> 07:33.680]  Dang!
[07:33.680 --> 07:34.980]  So it's probably worth like $20 or $30.
[07:35.220 --> 07:35.660]  That's pretty cool.
[07:35.660 --> 07:39.300]  And then I was opening up some Mosaic Football, which we'll do today here as well.
[07:39.560 --> 07:40.660]  And I pulled... God damn it.
[07:40.960 --> 07:43.640]  I pulled what's called a Genesis Parallel.
[07:43.880 --> 07:43.920]  Funny.
[07:44.040 --> 07:46.000]  These are case hits.
[07:46.440 --> 07:46.760]  Oh, wow.
[07:46.800 --> 07:48.660]  And you can see it's Aaron Jones.
[07:48.660 --> 07:53.100]  This bad boy is probably going to run you anywhere from $50 to $100.
[07:53.420 --> 07:53.640]  Dang!
[07:54.200 --> 07:54.500]  All right.
[07:54.680 --> 07:56.560]  There's a lot of money in this stack.
[07:56.700 --> 07:56.840]  Yeah.
[07:57.080 --> 07:58.540]  Gracie, we're making our money back.
[07:58.680 --> 07:59.380]  We're doing it.
[07:59.460 --> 08:02.520]  My Marcus Smart Genesises, they usually run $75 to $80.
[08:02.520 --> 08:02.980]  Oh, that's cool.
[08:03.200 --> 08:04.240]  Hey, good hits, man.
[08:04.320 --> 08:04.600]  Nice.
[08:04.660 --> 08:06.580]  So those are really cool hits that I wanted to share with you all.
[08:06.820 --> 08:08.160]  But here's the thing.
[08:08.220 --> 08:09.160]  We got to get new stuff.
[08:09.260 --> 08:09.840]  We got to get new stuff.
[08:09.860 --> 08:10.920]  We got to get new stuff.
[08:11.120 --> 08:11.300]  I need more.
[08:11.300 --> 08:12.240]  Let's open up the pack sack.
[08:12.620 --> 08:13.340]  Let's see what we get.
[08:15.160 --> 08:15.500]  Oh!
[08:16.120 --> 08:16.500]  What do we got?
[08:16.640 --> 08:17.380]  Roman Baseball.
[08:17.380 --> 08:17.960]  Oh, yeah.
[08:18.200 --> 08:18.420]  Interesting.
[08:19.160 --> 08:20.360]  1990 Bowman Baseball.
[08:21.060 --> 08:21.880]  Have no fear.
[08:22.040 --> 08:22.740]  There's bubblegum in here.
[08:23.100 --> 08:23.180]  Ooh!
[08:23.620 --> 08:24.120]  What do you think?
[08:24.200 --> 08:25.300]  There'll be no Zim in here.
[08:25.340 --> 08:25.540]  No.
[08:25.580 --> 08:26.020]  No, I don't think.
[08:26.040 --> 08:27.460]  I don't think he's in this set.
[08:27.740 --> 08:29.320]  Who was...
[08:30.080 --> 08:30.720]  I'll take that.
[08:30.940 --> 08:31.460]  Do you want me to...
[08:31.920 --> 08:34.080]  Who would be doing well in 1990?
[08:34.580 --> 08:35.420]  Like, what was that like?
[08:35.500 --> 08:35.700]  King Griffey Jr.
[08:35.940 --> 08:36.260]  Okay.
[08:36.760 --> 08:37.480]  Tom Glavin.
[08:38.080 --> 08:39.600]  Is there anything of value in these?
[08:39.660 --> 08:39.900]  John Smoltz.
[08:39.900 --> 08:40.240]  John Smoltz.
[08:40.380 --> 08:41.240]  Smoltzy, they call him.
[08:41.260 --> 08:41.400]  Yep.
[08:41.660 --> 08:43.040]  Got a lot of reflection today, huh?
[08:43.040 --> 08:43.260]  Yeah.
[08:44.280 --> 08:44.640]  Okay.
[08:46.820 --> 08:47.770]  Oh, Ken Daly.
[08:48.540 --> 08:48.780]  Okay.
[08:48.980 --> 08:50.740]  He's looking too serious for sports.
[08:50.840 --> 08:51.160]  Cool.
[08:51.280 --> 08:52.060]  Maybe that's a...
[08:52.060 --> 08:53.680]  I think that's a manager or something.
[08:54.420 --> 08:54.740]  Is he?
[08:54.900 --> 08:55.300]  I don't know.
[08:55.360 --> 08:56.320]  He's holding a piece of paper.
[08:58.020 --> 08:58.780]  He, uh...
[08:58.780 --> 09:01.160]  You gotta look official when you're holding a piece of paper.
[09:01.220 --> 09:02.800]  You're like, I'm doing business stuff.
[09:03.100 --> 09:04.660]  I think he's a pitcher, maybe.
[09:05.540 --> 09:07.600]  And then you put him on top of the socks and it tilts him.
[09:07.840 --> 09:07.960]  Ah!
[09:09.180 --> 09:11.060]  Oh, here we got Barry Lyons.
[09:11.920 --> 09:12.900]  That's an animal.
[09:12.900 --> 09:14.600]  Oh, yeah.
[09:14.720 --> 09:15.420]  Dave Parker.
[09:15.420 --> 09:16.860]  He's actually multiple animals.
[09:17.760 --> 09:18.800]  Lloyd Mosby.
[09:18.960 --> 09:20.500]  Oh, that's a good smile.
[09:20.820 --> 09:21.940]  He's a little cheeky guy.
[09:22.220 --> 09:23.540]  That's a good smile.
[09:24.080 --> 09:26.840]  Here we have Dan Schatzeter.
[09:27.240 --> 09:30.220]  That's a name that sounds like a dirty word, but it's not.
[09:30.520 --> 09:32.060]  We'll go ahead and save Dan Schatzeter.
[09:32.160 --> 09:32.580]  It's a tough one.
[09:32.620 --> 09:33.000]  Thank you.
[09:33.300 --> 09:34.300]  Pat Combs.
[09:35.120 --> 09:37.280]  Here's an art card for what looks like...
[09:37.280 --> 09:39.040]  I'm gonna guess Will Clark, probably.
[09:39.160 --> 09:41.880]  Doesn't say, but that looks like his smile.
[09:43.860 --> 09:45.240]  Yeah, I'm gonna assume that's Will Clark.
[09:46.320 --> 09:47.200]  Mark Lemke.
[09:48.060 --> 09:48.940]  Rob Murphy.
[09:49.020 --> 09:49.280]  He looks sad.
[09:49.820 --> 09:49.840]  Ooh!
[09:50.640 --> 09:51.260]  Who, Rob Lemke?
[09:51.880 --> 09:52.540]  He looks...
[09:52.540 --> 09:53.320]  He looks concerned.
[09:53.640 --> 09:56.800]  He looks straight up like his...
[09:59.080 --> 10:00.940]  My mom said she'll pick me up.
[10:01.400 --> 10:02.140]  Let's save that.
[10:02.340 --> 10:03.300]  It's too sad for sports.
[10:03.480 --> 10:04.700]  Too sad for sports.
[10:04.720 --> 10:05.400]  Rob Murphy.
[10:06.020 --> 10:06.720]  Oh, here we go.
[10:06.960 --> 10:07.600]  Crime dog.
[10:08.040 --> 10:08.480]  Hey!
[10:09.100 --> 10:09.940]  Love Fred McGriff.
[10:10.060 --> 10:11.020]  He was one of my favorite players when I was a kid.
[10:11.020 --> 10:11.400]  Hell yeah.
[10:11.460 --> 10:13.960]  Did you call him crime dog?
[10:14.400 --> 10:15.160]  That was his nickname.
[10:15.540 --> 10:16.060]  That's tight.
[10:16.160 --> 10:16.540]  That's his nickname, yeah.
[10:16.740 --> 10:17.780]  He was a Padre for a while.
[10:17.900 --> 10:18.380]  He's the crime dog.
[10:18.500 --> 10:19.140]  Great player.
[10:19.260 --> 10:19.740]  Lee Smith.
[10:20.340 --> 10:20.700]  Squintin.
[10:21.160 --> 10:21.900]  Sun's in his eyes.
[10:22.140 --> 10:23.080]  Yeah, way too bright.
[10:23.220 --> 10:23.960]  The future's too bright.
[10:24.220 --> 10:25.340]  Yeah, the future's too bright.
[10:25.700 --> 10:26.340]  Steve Olin.
[10:27.540 --> 10:28.260]  Andre Santana.
[10:28.640 --> 10:29.180]  And then Terry...
[10:29.580 --> 10:30.420]  That's a good squat.
[10:30.800 --> 10:31.440]  I'm gonna need that.
[10:31.440 --> 10:32.000]  Top of the squat.
[10:32.120 --> 10:33.160]  Top of the squat.
[10:33.220 --> 10:34.620]  Guys, really, really all the way there.
[10:34.780 --> 10:35.100]  All right.
[10:35.100 --> 10:35.580]  There we go.
[10:36.100 --> 10:37.920]  All right, that was a good little pack sack.
[10:37.920 --> 10:40.900]  All right, let's start off with one more of these.
[10:41.100 --> 10:42.660]  Eric didn't get to see these bad boys.
[10:42.980 --> 10:44.760]  These are the historical editions.
[10:44.780 --> 10:48.040]  You kept calling them, like, presidential, and it's not just presidents.
[10:48.160 --> 10:50.700]  Yeah, it's just every time I look at it, all I see is Abe Lincoln and Obama.
[10:50.940 --> 10:51.720]  So I always think president.
[10:51.800 --> 10:52.820]  And Kennedy.
[10:53.260 --> 10:54.060]  And Abraham.
[10:54.200 --> 10:55.320]  And Babe Ruth.
[10:55.640 --> 10:56.660]  And George Washington.
[10:57.620 --> 10:59.220]  He was the president of being a badass at baseball.
[10:59.560 --> 11:00.560]  Old Tom Morris.
[11:00.920 --> 11:03.000]  We all remember Old Tom Morris.
[11:03.020 --> 11:04.280]  Old Tom Morris.
[11:04.280 --> 11:07.660]  Did you know that during his prime, he won his four open championships?
[11:07.880 --> 11:09.020]  Morris only used four clubs.
[11:09.680 --> 11:10.180]  Golfer.
[11:10.800 --> 11:13.040]  Here we have Baby Ruth.
[11:14.140 --> 11:15.840]  You were looking for one of those.
[11:16.460 --> 11:17.440]  Slim for Babe Ruth.
[11:18.360 --> 11:20.680]  Ooh, gold foil JP Morgan.
[11:22.340 --> 11:22.840]  Wow.
[11:23.380 --> 11:24.220]  We'll sleeve that.
[11:24.280 --> 11:24.840]  All right.
[11:25.320 --> 11:28.490]  Oh, and another historic figure, Captain Blackbeard.
[11:29.160 --> 11:29.760]  Blue foil.
[11:29.980 --> 11:30.000]  Wow.
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.220]  That's a real picture of him, too.
[11:31.780 --> 11:33.080]  Is that a mustache?
[11:33.080 --> 11:34.700]  Steam is coming out of his mouth.
[11:34.700 --> 11:36.760]  That might be an art card.
[11:37.040 --> 11:37.840]  A special art card.
[11:38.360 --> 11:39.100]  All right.
[11:40.020 --> 11:41.240]  Goddamn, I want to open up another one of those.
[11:41.320 --> 11:41.820]  These are fun.
[11:41.960 --> 11:43.580]  So this is where the Van Gogh came from, right?
[11:43.760 --> 11:44.520]  Yeah, this is the Van Gogh.
[11:44.620 --> 11:46.480]  So we won't get anything else that size?
[11:46.720 --> 11:47.180]  We might.
[11:47.480 --> 11:47.740]  Really?
[11:47.880 --> 11:49.620]  Yeah, there are two hits per box.
[11:49.800 --> 11:50.460]  And we've only got one.
[11:52.520 --> 11:54.000]  Relic 101s or Autos.
[11:54.180 --> 11:55.040]  So we already got a Relic.
[11:55.040 --> 11:57.000]  Vincent Van Gogh Auto on card?
[11:57.180 --> 11:57.320]  Dang.
[11:57.320 --> 11:58.660]  We just got our next Relic.
[11:58.740 --> 11:59.100]  Really?
[11:59.380 --> 11:59.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:00.020 --> 12:01.940]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[12:02.200 --> 12:03.060]  What do you think it is?
[12:03.060 --> 12:03.300]  What do you think it is, Emily?
[12:03.480 --> 12:05.120]  I think that it's going to be...
[12:05.960 --> 12:06.420]  I don't, I don't.
[12:07.880 --> 12:08.240]  Sports?
[12:09.440 --> 12:10.060]  I'm going to...
[12:10.060 --> 12:10.640]  All right, we'll see.
[12:10.780 --> 12:12.780]  I'm going to say Ross Perot Crackdice.
[12:12.840 --> 12:13.060]  Okay.
[12:13.200 --> 12:13.480]  Dang.
[12:13.660 --> 12:13.780]  Ross Perot.
[12:14.740 --> 12:15.460]  Abner Doubleday.
[12:15.680 --> 12:16.080]  Oh, baseball.
[12:17.920 --> 12:18.560]  MLK Jr.
[12:18.580 --> 12:19.060]  All right.
[12:19.200 --> 12:20.120]  Just like another art card.
[12:20.120 --> 12:20.380]  Art card.
[12:20.460 --> 12:20.540]  Cool.
[12:21.540 --> 12:22.260]  Meriwether Lewis.
[12:22.560 --> 12:23.320]  That's a gold.
[12:23.900 --> 12:24.260]  Meriwether.
[12:24.460 --> 12:25.560]  Is that from like Lewis and Clark?
[12:25.620 --> 12:25.760]  Yeah.
[12:25.860 --> 12:26.200]  Yeah, okay.
[12:26.660 --> 12:27.300]  And then...
[12:27.300 --> 12:27.920]  Oh, shit.
[12:28.300 --> 12:28.820]  Is it it?
[12:29.020 --> 12:29.400]  Is it it?
[12:29.400 --> 12:30.360]  Oh, my God.
[12:30.420 --> 12:30.860]  Is it good?
[12:30.860 --> 12:32.400]  It's a triple relic.
[12:32.460 --> 12:33.100]  A triple?
[12:33.520 --> 12:35.780]  Yeah, it's a tri-relic.
[12:36.360 --> 12:41.880]  We have Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Rembrandt.
[12:41.880 --> 12:44.060]  Wow, this is the art pack.
[12:46.500 --> 12:48.260]  I think we've got...
[12:48.260 --> 12:48.780]  Pussy Slay.
[12:49.040 --> 12:49.480]  What?
[12:50.520 --> 12:50.940]  Wow.
[12:51.240 --> 12:51.800]  Congratulations.
[12:51.980 --> 12:53.900]  You've received an authentic relic from the past.
[12:53.980 --> 12:58.620]  The front of this card features the following types of authentic and original relics.
[12:58.620 --> 13:09.060]  Original newspapers, original handwritten letters, time period manuscripts, letters and documents, land grants, presidential documents, handwritten words, books, tickets, and other relics that were attributed to the subjects on this card.
[13:09.360 --> 13:09.800]  Dang.
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.560]  Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Rembrandt.
[13:11.640 --> 13:12.000]  Lay it down.
[13:12.080 --> 13:12.520]  Let's see it.
[13:12.860 --> 13:13.340]  All owned.
[13:13.640 --> 13:15.940]  I'm sorry, but that's just blank pieces of paper.
[13:16.160 --> 13:16.540]  I agree.
[13:17.580 --> 13:20.600]  Yeah, they might be like fragments from...
[13:20.600 --> 13:20.980]  Don't touch it.
[13:20.980 --> 13:21.680]  You're going to ruin it.
[13:22.020 --> 13:22.740]  Well, I'm a professional.
[13:23.220 --> 13:26.120]  They might be fragments from like a canvas.
[13:26.760 --> 13:28.200]  And it doesn't feel like a canvas?
[13:28.200 --> 13:29.480]  Yeah, it kind of does.
[13:29.500 --> 13:30.000]  The top one does.
[13:30.060 --> 13:30.280]  The top one does, that's why.
[13:30.720 --> 13:31.780]  That's definitely words.
[13:32.260 --> 13:33.700]  That's Rembrandt's handwriting.
[13:34.480 --> 13:34.840]  Wow.
[13:35.320 --> 13:36.200]  So, there you go.
[13:36.380 --> 13:37.200]  Pretty fucking ridiculous.
[13:37.580 --> 13:37.740]  Dang.
[13:38.060 --> 13:38.960]  Okay, so we got...
[13:38.960 --> 13:39.200]  They shouldn't...
[13:39.200 --> 13:41.360]  We've got a full like art gallery here.
[13:41.360 --> 13:41.760]  We're going to get all the artists.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.840]  I feel like they shouldn't cut those things up and put them in trading cards.
[13:45.840 --> 13:45.960]  That's...
[13:45.960 --> 13:47.040]  Yeah, they probably shouldn't, but they do.
[13:47.300 --> 13:48.040]  But they do.
[13:48.300 --> 13:49.800]  And we must take full advantage of them.
[13:49.920 --> 13:50.120]  Yes.
[13:50.220 --> 13:51.640]  If somebody's going to do it, we're going to...
[13:51.640 --> 13:51.820]  Yeah.
[13:51.960 --> 13:52.880]  We're going to save it.
[13:52.960 --> 13:54.080]  We're going to take care of it.
[13:54.240 --> 13:54.860]  I'm quitting.
[13:54.860 --> 13:58.240]  The three of the greatest artists of all time touch.
[13:58.540 --> 14:01.540]  This Rembrandt one has writing on the back of the paper, too.
[14:01.800 --> 14:02.200]  Wow.
[14:02.280 --> 14:02.840]  I know.
[14:03.220 --> 14:03.560]  Double-sided.
[14:03.980 --> 14:04.440]  It is.
[14:04.640 --> 14:05.960]  We should open it up like a rip card.
[14:06.080 --> 14:06.360]  Yeah.
[14:06.840 --> 14:07.280]  No, we shouldn't.
[14:07.500 --> 14:07.880]  Don't do that.
[14:07.960 --> 14:08.400]  Don't say that.
[14:08.760 --> 14:09.760]  That is a...
[14:09.760 --> 14:10.220]  Rip it.
[14:10.340 --> 14:11.060]  Rip the relic.
[14:11.100 --> 14:12.800]  There's no way to...
[14:12.800 --> 14:14.660]  Rip and relic.
[14:14.900 --> 14:15.420]  Do I go in here?
[14:15.540 --> 14:15.820]  Mm-mm.
[14:16.940 --> 14:17.740]  Oh, God.
[14:18.280 --> 14:18.900]  Leave it out.
[14:18.980 --> 14:22.020]  I'll give you a thick sleeve for it later.
[14:22.220 --> 14:22.460]  Top letter.
[14:22.720 --> 14:22.900]  Okay.
[14:24.840 --> 14:25.940]  Yeah, the sleeve is fine.
[14:26.860 --> 14:28.080]  I'll put it in a top letter later.
[14:28.820 --> 14:31.320]  Now we're going to open up NFL Mosaic because it's NFL season.
[14:31.460 --> 14:32.300]  We're going to save this pack.
[14:32.380 --> 14:33.360]  It is NFL season.
[14:34.180 --> 14:34.820]  Week six.
[14:35.040 --> 14:36.200]  What NFL team do you like?
[14:37.000 --> 14:37.760]  None of them.
[14:38.580 --> 14:39.860]  He's a Chargers fan.
[14:39.960 --> 14:40.960]  No, I'm not a Chargers fan.
[14:40.960 --> 14:41.420]  No, no, no.
[14:41.480 --> 14:42.000]  San Diego Chargers.
[14:42.300 --> 14:44.280]  Well, yes, when they were the San Diego Chargers.
[14:44.460 --> 14:46.860]  I have watched the Chargers, and the whole time I'm going,
[14:46.940 --> 14:47.980]  you better fucking lose this game.
[14:49.340 --> 14:50.280]  You better lose this game.
[14:50.280 --> 14:50.960]  Who did they play last year?
[14:50.960 --> 14:52.460]  Keenan Alley, you better lose this game.
[14:52.860 --> 14:53.480]  Dalvin Cook.
[14:54.920 --> 14:55.880]  Dalton Kincaid.
[14:56.500 --> 15:00.980]  I think these are like, these are parallels or SPs.
[15:01.260 --> 15:02.260]  These sideways rookie cards.
[15:02.420 --> 15:03.080]  We'll just leave that.
[15:03.880 --> 15:04.780]  Trey Lance.
[15:05.360 --> 15:06.300]  Boy, that dude.
[15:06.500 --> 15:09.580]  Talk about hurting your ankle, and then there goes your career thanks to Brock Purdy.
[15:10.220 --> 15:10.700]  Good lord.
[15:11.260 --> 15:14.080]  He was like super highly touted.
[15:14.180 --> 15:15.200]  People were really excited about him.
[15:15.240 --> 15:16.980]  Was playing really fucking well his rookie season.
[15:17.280 --> 15:19.480]  Snapped his leg in half like a Paul George style.
[15:19.480 --> 15:20.020]  Oh, no.
[15:20.020 --> 15:22.940]  And got replaced by Brock Purdy, and now they don't want him or care about him.
[15:22.940 --> 15:25.860]  They gave him to the Cowboys, right?
[15:26.900 --> 15:27.320]  Yeah, they did.
[15:27.440 --> 15:27.880]  They gave him to the Cowboys.
[15:28.520 --> 15:29.180]  Watch this.
[15:29.180 --> 15:30.140]  Lay the cards down flat.
[15:30.620 --> 15:31.260]  Boom, baby.
[15:31.380 --> 15:31.860]  No more glare.
[15:32.420 --> 15:32.700]  We're back.
[15:32.760 --> 15:33.340]  We fixed it.
[15:33.480 --> 15:34.560]  We don't need the socks anymore.
[15:34.900 --> 15:35.580]  My socks.
[15:36.200 --> 15:37.020]  Oh, look at this.
[15:37.060 --> 15:37.780]  Darren Waller.
[15:38.200 --> 15:38.540]  Silver.
[15:39.220 --> 15:40.320]  That looks crazy.
[15:40.480 --> 15:41.020]  That's nice.
[15:41.200 --> 15:41.400]  That's cool.
[15:41.920 --> 15:43.600]  And then Thunder Lane.
[15:43.920 --> 15:45.540]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[15:46.080 --> 15:46.460]  What's that?
[15:46.580 --> 15:47.360]  Who did they play for?
[15:47.660 --> 15:47.980]  Lions.
[15:47.980 --> 15:48.360]  Lions.
[15:48.700 --> 15:48.740]  Nice.
[15:48.840 --> 15:49.440]  We like the Lions.
[15:49.660 --> 15:49.960]  We do.
[15:50.040 --> 15:50.260]  I like the Lions.
[15:50.440 --> 15:51.020]  We got nothing against them.
[15:51.220 --> 15:51.780]  We do like the Lions.
[15:51.880 --> 15:53.440]  They beat the Buccaneers this weekend.
[15:53.440 --> 15:55.140]  They're currently on their kneecap tour.
[15:56.520 --> 15:56.900]  It's Lions?
[15:56.980 --> 15:59.120]  Yeah, that's what the...
[15:59.120 --> 16:03.140]  Remember, it was something like one of their first games, one of the main guys on the other
[16:03.140 --> 16:08.200]  team broke his knee or something, and then the coach said, like, we're going to break
[16:08.200 --> 16:12.380]  everybody else's knees, and so now there's a t-shirt with their schedule that says the
[16:12.380 --> 16:14.240]  kneecap tour with all these skeletons on it.
[16:14.300 --> 16:15.100]  Yeah, get them, skeletons.
[16:15.160 --> 16:15.380]  Yeah.
[16:15.380 --> 16:18.060]  And then we have Aaron Rodgers in his...
[16:18.060 --> 16:18.860]  There he is.
[16:19.060 --> 16:19.920]  Aaron Rodgers.
[16:20.420 --> 16:21.920]  Like it says there on the card.
[16:22.880 --> 16:23.720]  National pride.
[16:24.140 --> 16:27.360]  In his Jets uniform, he wore for all of about four minutes.
[16:27.440 --> 16:30.880]  We watched him do two plays, and then we went, oh, that's weird.
[16:30.900 --> 16:31.600]  Did he roll his ankle?
[16:31.880 --> 16:32.060]  Yeah.
[16:32.120 --> 16:37.120]  And then he was gone forever, and then he went on Pat McAfee's show, and he said, hey, Travis
[16:37.120 --> 16:41.940]  Kelsey, I'll bring Robert Kennedy, and you bring Dr. Fauci, and let's debate.
[16:41.940 --> 16:45.640]  And that's the single craziest thing I've ever fucking heard.
[16:45.680 --> 16:46.100]  What?
[16:46.560 --> 16:47.640]  Aaron Rodgers eats mud.
[16:47.940 --> 16:48.100]  Yeah.
[16:48.160 --> 16:48.520]  What?
[16:48.820 --> 16:56.140]  Yeah, he wants to debate Travis Kelsey on vaccines because Travis Kelsey is doing, like, commercials
[16:56.140 --> 16:56.660]  for...
[16:56.660 --> 16:57.260]  Wow.
[16:57.520 --> 16:59.400]  And Aaron Rodgers eats mud.
[16:59.460 --> 16:59.640]  Yeah.
[17:00.160 --> 17:01.060]  Wow, well...
[17:01.060 --> 17:01.480]  Delicious mud.
[17:01.600 --> 17:03.680]  It makes your ankles really strong, I guess.
[17:04.080 --> 17:04.440]  Yeah.
[17:04.560 --> 17:05.300]  Quite the opposite.
[17:05.420 --> 17:05.560]  Yeah.
[17:06.060 --> 17:07.260]  God, that sucks.
[17:07.280 --> 17:10.780]  Kenneth Walker, Jerry Judy, who's got a great football name.
[17:10.780 --> 17:11.420]  Great name.
[17:11.880 --> 17:12.680]  Jonathan Mingo.
[17:13.360 --> 17:14.140]  That's a...
[17:14.140 --> 17:15.200]  We'll just leave that.
[17:15.320 --> 17:16.180]  Jonathan Mingo.
[17:16.260 --> 17:18.280]  Ooh, Jason Taylor of Prism.
[17:18.540 --> 17:18.940]  That's nice.
[17:19.040 --> 17:19.700]  Look how pretty that is.
[17:19.840 --> 17:20.640]  Okay, just leave that.
[17:21.180 --> 17:24.360]  And then we got Cameron Latue, rookie.
[17:24.640 --> 17:25.060]  That's pretty.
[17:25.320 --> 17:25.580]  Yeah.
[17:26.160 --> 17:27.280]  That's like a practice.
[17:27.460 --> 17:30.080]  Yeah, he's in his... he's in his practice gear.
[17:30.480 --> 17:30.800]  Okay.
[17:31.500 --> 17:32.880]  Let's burn through some more of these.
[17:32.900 --> 17:35.540]  He looks like he's doing the... what was the last one?
[17:35.560 --> 17:37.120]  Jameson Williams, year two card.
[17:37.360 --> 17:38.240]  Chris Olave.
[17:38.240 --> 17:38.680]  Okay.
[17:38.680 --> 17:41.000]  Oh, it looks like he's doing a... like a little kick.
[17:41.580 --> 17:41.960]  He's like...
[17:41.960 --> 17:43.340]  Like a little...
[17:43.340 --> 17:44.220]  Like he's on a scooter.
[17:44.640 --> 17:45.120]  And he's going...
[17:45.120 --> 17:48.000]  Or if he's like... he's either on a scooter or he's like a rocket.
[17:48.360 --> 17:48.740]  We'll save that.
[17:49.620 --> 17:50.320]  Bless you.
[17:50.740 --> 17:51.380]  Oh my God.
[17:53.040 --> 17:53.840]  Josh Downs.
[17:54.560 --> 17:57.080]  You know, it's all about the Josh Ups and the Josh Downs.
[17:57.800 --> 17:59.000]  It's... take it as it comes.
[17:59.420 --> 18:01.960]  That's a... that's a... that's a good joke to make out of that card.
[18:03.420 --> 18:04.160]  Vaughn Miller.
[18:05.340 --> 18:06.140]  Keyshawn Johnson.
[18:06.500 --> 18:06.600]  God.
[18:06.600 --> 18:08.220]  He's spicy today.
[18:08.220 --> 18:08.980]  I'm sorry.
[18:08.980 --> 18:09.580]  We're getting red hot.
[18:09.600 --> 18:10.520]  No, it is because...
[18:10.520 --> 18:10.600]  I'm sorry.
[18:10.820 --> 18:14.320]  No, because I was... I went other places and then I was like, I'm just gonna move on from this card.
[18:14.860 --> 18:15.620]  Derwin James.
[18:16.080 --> 18:16.940]  Derwin James, junior.
[18:17.220 --> 18:17.820]  Junior, sorry.
[18:19.360 --> 18:20.200]  Stefon Diggs.
[18:20.480 --> 18:21.280]  Everybody likes Stefon Diggs.
[18:21.300 --> 18:24.040]  I thought that said L everyone and it's...
[18:24.040 --> 18:24.460]  L of it.
[18:26.460 --> 18:28.060]  The kerning is just sort of...
[18:28.060 --> 18:29.280]  All right, we are...
[18:29.280 --> 18:29.520]  Oh.
[18:30.440 --> 18:31.620]  This is a little thicker.
[18:32.020 --> 18:32.420]  Oh.
[18:32.540 --> 18:32.880]  I don't know.
[18:33.640 --> 18:34.480]  Devante Adams.
[18:34.480 --> 18:36.820]  Kind of disappeared since you went to that team.
[18:37.600 --> 18:38.260]  What team?
[18:38.400 --> 18:39.820]  D to V, the Raiders.
[18:41.280 --> 18:42.160]  Jalen Hurts.
[18:42.360 --> 18:42.920]  All right.
[18:43.660 --> 18:44.680]  Didn't look so good yesterday.
[18:45.160 --> 18:45.360]  Nope.
[18:46.260 --> 18:47.140]  Dan Hampton.
[18:48.220 --> 18:50.080]  The only... both undefeated teams lost yesterday.
[18:50.600 --> 18:51.480]  Cam Smith.
[18:51.640 --> 18:52.780]  What is a Dan Hampton card?
[18:53.360 --> 18:54.440]  Does he got like the neck roll on?
[18:54.500 --> 18:55.600]  Yeah, it's like 80s.
[18:55.940 --> 18:56.380]  Wow.
[18:56.720 --> 18:59.740]  Remember when that was like the toughest, tough guys were those?
[18:59.820 --> 19:02.660]  They were like, this is what's gonna stop you from breaking your neck.
[19:02.920 --> 19:02.960]  Yes.
[19:02.960 --> 19:05.120]  Michael Strahan parallel, I guess.
[19:05.300 --> 19:05.980]  Michael Strahan?
[19:06.320 --> 19:06.420]  Yeah.
[19:06.540 --> 19:06.980]  Wow, cool.
[19:07.100 --> 19:10.320]  One more card pack and then we'll move on to something else.
[19:12.020 --> 19:12.940]  Mike Quick.
[19:13.880 --> 19:16.240]  Oh, one of my favorite running backs of all time with Damian Thomas.
[19:16.800 --> 19:17.160]  Me too.
[19:17.800 --> 19:18.960]  Art Monk.
[19:20.280 --> 19:22.180]  Billy White Shoes Johnson.
[19:23.020 --> 19:25.140]  Boy, there are really a lot of classics in this set.
[19:25.620 --> 19:26.160]  DJ Moore.
[19:26.900 --> 19:31.160]  And then speaking of classics, here's a Joe Namath for Fame parallel.
[19:31.440 --> 19:32.460]  Okay, that's good, right?
[19:32.460 --> 19:32.900]  Yeah.
[19:33.380 --> 19:34.340]  Who's on the Brady Bunch?
[19:34.660 --> 19:36.300]  Is he the one that wore the big coat?
[19:36.680 --> 19:36.820]  Yeah.
[19:36.960 --> 19:37.600]  The Ken coat?
[19:39.000 --> 19:40.420]  The Damian Thomas card was cool.
[19:40.580 --> 19:40.740]  Yeah.
[19:40.960 --> 19:41.360]  Really guilty.
[19:41.620 --> 19:42.060]  That's nice.
[19:42.120 --> 19:42.540]  He's a cool dude.
[19:42.620 --> 19:43.380]  Oh, we got some mail.
[19:43.800 --> 19:44.420]  Okay, cool.
[19:45.160 --> 19:46.740]  If you want to send us mail, you can.
[19:46.840 --> 19:47.840]  Send us a break show.
[19:48.640 --> 19:51.460]  1901 East 51st Street, Austin, Texas 78723.
[19:52.040 --> 19:54.060]  We have so much mail that we'll be getting too soon.
[19:54.700 --> 19:55.940]  It just takes a while, you know what I mean?
[19:56.080 --> 19:57.680]  Read on stream or don't, it says.
[19:57.980 --> 20:00.000]  Regulation listener from day one, long time RT fan.
[20:00.260 --> 20:01.260]  First time package sender.
[20:01.260 --> 20:04.640]  Well, thank you for the package, Devin.
[20:05.760 --> 20:08.260]  I've gone in and out of card collecting my whole life, haven't we all?
[20:08.400 --> 20:10.620]  And I sympathize with that.
[20:11.380 --> 20:12.860]  The break show has become one of my favorite parts of the week.
[20:12.960 --> 20:14.640]  Breaking packs was always my favorite part of collecting.
[20:14.840 --> 20:18.380]  I know, me too, which is unfortunate because it's the least effective.
[20:19.400 --> 20:23.180]  The hit and the adrenaline and excitement of hitting a chase card is...
[20:23.180 --> 20:24.900]  Anyway, he says a lot of really nice stuff.
[20:25.120 --> 20:26.260]  And then he sent us.
[20:26.600 --> 20:29.460]  The baseball pack comes to you from Truist Field, home of the Atlanta Braves.
[20:29.460 --> 20:32.380]  As a side note, you've commented several times that you like Dansby Swanson.
[20:32.960 --> 20:33.180]  Yeah.
[20:33.840 --> 20:34.920]  Great baseball name.
[20:35.040 --> 20:35.220]  Thank you, Devin.
[20:35.620 --> 20:38.060]  The cards are from Truist Field?
[20:38.120 --> 20:38.780]  This pack is.
[20:38.900 --> 20:39.200]  Really?
[20:39.560 --> 20:40.040]  More value.
[20:40.040 --> 20:40.400]  That's cool.
[20:41.440 --> 20:41.940]  Yeah, that's great.
[20:42.560 --> 20:43.580]  Got some Batman returns.
[20:44.180 --> 20:45.240]  We'll put one in the pack sack.
[20:45.320 --> 20:46.040]  Gotta feed that pack sack.
[20:46.360 --> 20:47.120]  Let's see what's up with Batman.
[20:47.360 --> 20:49.000]  They package it in a Werther's Original box.
[20:49.080 --> 20:49.720]  I like that.
[20:49.920 --> 20:54.180]  I have a feeling that all of these Batman cards are going to be stills from the movie.
[20:54.780 --> 20:56.900]  Here we have...
[20:56.900 --> 20:58.540]  A still from the movie.
[20:58.540 --> 21:00.120]  Burn, baby, burn.
[21:00.840 --> 21:01.900]  I loved this one.
[21:02.060 --> 21:02.760]  Rescuing the Ice Princess.
[21:02.760 --> 21:03.720]  I think this one was my favorite.
[21:03.940 --> 21:04.680]  Which one was your favorite?
[21:05.280 --> 21:05.800]  Batman movie?
[21:05.980 --> 21:06.120]  Yeah.
[21:06.280 --> 21:06.880]  The first one.
[21:07.280 --> 21:07.720]  Is that this one?
[21:07.840 --> 21:09.020]  No, the 1989 one.
[21:09.240 --> 21:09.620]  Oh, the Joker.
[21:10.680 --> 21:11.800]  What do you want?
[21:13.720 --> 21:14.820]  Don't interfere, Batman.
[21:16.220 --> 21:17.320]  Roar of the Batmobile.
[21:18.100 --> 21:19.280]  I like this one, too.
[21:19.340 --> 21:19.920]  It was just weird.
[21:20.180 --> 21:21.800]  And if you go back and watch it now, it's still kind of weird.
[21:22.140 --> 21:23.060]  What's weird about it?
[21:23.180 --> 21:23.440]  Tim Burton.
[21:23.800 --> 21:24.060]  Yeah.
[21:24.220 --> 21:25.000]  Well, it was very Tim Burton-y.
[21:25.640 --> 21:27.540]  Maybe that's just the right kind of age that I liked.
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.700]  It's not a bad movie, it's just...
[21:29.700 --> 21:31.440]  I was the same age and I hated that movie.
[21:31.980 --> 21:32.060]  Wow.
[21:32.840 --> 21:34.040]  I don't like Tim Burton stuff, though.
[21:34.260 --> 21:34.900]  It's gross.
[21:35.440 --> 21:37.460]  Let's see what we get from this Topps Heritage.
[21:37.520 --> 21:38.940]  People fucking love Topps Heritage.
[21:39.040 --> 21:40.280]  I've never gotten a good card out of that.
[21:40.280 --> 21:41.260]  Well, maybe this time we will.
[21:41.480 --> 21:42.160]  Colton Wong.
[21:42.420 --> 21:43.200]  Mark Hanna.
[21:44.740 --> 21:46.180]  G. Juan Bae, rookie.
[21:46.280 --> 21:46.680]  That's cool.
[21:47.320 --> 21:50.600]  All-Star First Baseman Paul Goldschmidt and Vladdy Jr.
[21:51.300 --> 21:52.680]  Garrett Mitchell, rookie.
[21:52.880 --> 21:53.640]  That's cool.
[21:55.020 --> 21:55.820]  Lance McCullers.
[21:56.700 --> 21:57.740]  Danny Jansen.
[21:59.020 --> 22:00.060]  Elier Hernandez.
[22:00.780 --> 22:01.820]  Andre Jimenez.
[22:02.540 --> 22:03.580]  Alex Bregman.
[22:05.320 --> 22:06.360]  MJ Melendez.
[22:07.220 --> 22:07.740]  Slidin'.
[22:07.740 --> 22:07.920]  Nice.
[22:09.200 --> 22:10.420]  Oh, Adoles Garcia.
[22:10.680 --> 22:10.940]  I don't...
[22:11.400 --> 22:12.120]  He lost his hat.
[22:12.540 --> 22:13.000]  His...
[22:13.000 --> 22:13.720]  Oh, no, his hat.
[22:13.920 --> 22:14.440]  His hat fell off.
[22:15.180 --> 22:15.840]  Here we go.
[22:15.880 --> 22:16.560]  Maybe it's that.
[22:16.720 --> 22:17.540]  Ryan Nelson, rookie.
[22:17.540 --> 22:18.080]  It's in here.
[22:18.120 --> 22:18.680]  Oh, here we go.
[22:18.960 --> 22:19.920]  Adley Rutschman.
[22:20.120 --> 22:20.400]  Okay.
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.140]  Rookie Cup card.
[22:22.200 --> 22:22.800]  That's cool.
[22:22.920 --> 22:23.020]  Yeah.
[22:23.020 --> 22:23.500]  I'll take that.
[22:23.640 --> 22:24.400]  Rod Carew.
[22:25.300 --> 22:26.100]  Luis Arreaz.
[22:26.740 --> 22:28.420]  That's sort of a then-and-now thing, I guess.
[22:28.660 --> 22:28.900]  Cool.
[22:29.200 --> 22:30.200]  CJ Abrams.
[22:30.220 --> 22:32.220]  He was a big chase two years ago.
[22:32.280 --> 22:32.760]  He's a...
[22:32.760 --> 22:34.020]  Louis Varland, rookie.
[22:35.280 --> 22:38.660]  He looks like the guy in a Lifetime Christmas movie.
[22:38.700 --> 22:38.900]  Yeah.
[22:39.060 --> 22:39.460]  Yeah.
[22:39.600 --> 22:39.800]  Yeah.
[22:40.340 --> 22:43.520]  He never left the town, and he stayed, and he took over the Airbnb.
[22:43.520 --> 22:44.540]  Looks like his name is Luke.
[22:44.960 --> 22:45.080]  Yeah.
[22:45.600 --> 22:45.800]  Yeah.
[22:45.800 --> 22:46.580]  His name is Luke.
[22:46.740 --> 22:48.040]  And he, like...
[22:48.040 --> 22:51.840]  The town is struggling, and he stuck around to help the town out, because it's more about
[22:51.840 --> 22:53.760]  community than it is about personal gain.
[22:53.940 --> 22:54.160]  Yeah.
[22:54.160 --> 22:54.360]  Yeah.
[22:54.520 --> 22:56.000]  And then the lady...
[22:56.000 --> 22:56.620]  Busy businesswoman.
[22:56.740 --> 22:58.020]  Busy businesswoman comes back.
[22:58.720 --> 23:01.120]  She's probably a journalist or a news reporter.
[23:01.120 --> 23:05.940]  Yeah, she's there to write a story on, like, her small town, and he's like, things haven't
[23:05.940 --> 23:06.160]  changed.
[23:06.220 --> 23:07.500]  I haven't seen you since high school.
[23:07.700 --> 23:09.140]  And she resists, and he...
[23:09.140 --> 23:10.080]  Yeah, he's just too...
[23:10.080 --> 23:10.820]  He's just too...
[23:10.820 --> 23:11.340]  He's too charming.
[23:11.420 --> 23:11.920]  He's too charming.
[23:12.000 --> 23:12.920]  He's really charming.
[23:12.940 --> 23:17.860]  Well, they have the Pumpkin Festival this year, and, you know, in unlikely of ways, they will
[23:17.860 --> 23:18.380]  get together.
[23:18.500 --> 23:18.700]  Yeah.
[23:19.440 --> 23:22.680]  Austin Hayes, Trace Thompson, and Javier Baez.
[23:22.720 --> 23:22.920]  Okay.
[23:23.080 --> 23:23.400]  Nice.
[23:23.460 --> 23:23.920]  That's a cool little pack.
[23:24.040 --> 23:25.100]  Thank you so much for sending that in.
[23:25.120 --> 23:25.440]  Thanks, Devin.
[23:25.500 --> 23:26.200]  Really, really appreciate it.
[23:26.200 --> 23:26.480]  Thanks.
[23:26.520 --> 23:27.180]  Send us some mail.
[23:27.720 --> 23:29.720]  We have a lot, but we can always use more.
[23:29.920 --> 23:31.200]  You want to open up some...
[23:31.820 --> 23:32.140]  Wrestling?
[23:32.360 --> 23:32.880]  Let's do it.
[23:33.080 --> 23:33.820]  All right, let's do it.
[23:34.140 --> 23:34.880]  I know how much you love...
[23:34.880 --> 23:36.240]  I think I just bought these for you, too.
[23:36.380 --> 23:37.800]  I went to so many wrestling shows this weekend.
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.020]  How many wrestling shows?
[23:39.760 --> 23:39.920]  Two.
[23:40.160 --> 23:40.540]  I went to two.
[23:40.760 --> 23:42.680]  Does anybody get really hurt at your wrestling shows?
[23:42.680 --> 23:45.020]  I've seen people, like, break ankles and stuff like that.
[23:45.200 --> 23:45.240]  Oh, my God.
[23:45.380 --> 23:46.440]  Are they Aaron Rodgers themselves?
[23:46.900 --> 23:47.760]  Yeah, sort of.
[23:48.540 --> 23:52.500]  Saw some guys bleed this weekend and stuff like that, but nothing, like, too crazy.
[23:52.720 --> 23:54.500]  Do you guys like it when they bleed?
[23:54.520 --> 23:56.020]  Because I know, like, the indie shows are a little bit more like that.
[23:56.020 --> 23:57.460]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:57.540 --> 23:58.560]  The deathmatch stuff.
[23:58.580 --> 24:01.860]  I have a friend, Dimitri Alexandrov, and he wrestles as...
[24:01.860 --> 24:07.880]  He's the Deathmatch Jesus, and he's out with a crown of barbed wire, and it is...
[24:07.880 --> 24:08.780]  A real barbed wire?
[24:08.860 --> 24:09.120]  Oh, yeah.
[24:09.200 --> 24:09.680]  Was he bleeding?
[24:10.080 --> 24:10.440]  No.
[24:11.240 --> 24:12.960]  He'll use it sometimes, hit the other guy.
[24:13.100 --> 24:13.240]  Oof.
[24:13.440 --> 24:13.600]  Yeah.
[24:14.320 --> 24:15.040]  It's awesome.
[24:15.620 --> 24:16.480]  It's so cool.
[24:16.840 --> 24:18.680]  All right, Eric, you're on.
[24:18.740 --> 24:19.180]  Let's do it.
[24:20.380 --> 24:20.740]  Edge.
[24:20.860 --> 24:21.220]  Edge!
[24:21.420 --> 24:23.320]  Edge just went to AEW.
[24:23.680 --> 24:24.600]  He left WWE.
[24:24.780 --> 24:25.440]  He's Adam Copeland.
[24:25.540 --> 24:26.360]  He's in AEW.
[24:26.580 --> 24:27.920]  It was a big acquisition kind of thing.
[24:28.040 --> 24:29.680]  Does he hate Cody Rhodes?
[24:29.720 --> 24:31.860]  And when Cody Rhodes went to WWE, he's like, fuck this.
[24:32.120 --> 24:36.000]  No, they wanted his spinal stenosis, and they wanted him to retire, and he did.
[24:36.160 --> 24:36.640]  So do I.
[24:36.820 --> 24:37.360]  There you go.
[24:37.380 --> 24:37.660]  Nice.
[24:38.040 --> 24:39.200]  I mean, don't wrestle.
[24:39.580 --> 24:44.360]  But then he healed, and they didn't really want him to do anything in WWE, so he's like,
[24:44.380 --> 24:45.900]  I'll go over to AEW, where my friends are.
[24:45.900 --> 24:47.140]  So he went over there, and he's been wrestling.
[24:47.240 --> 24:47.600]  He's been cool.
[24:47.780 --> 24:48.900]  And the spine's doing okay?
[24:49.100 --> 24:49.240]  Yeah.
[24:49.360 --> 24:49.600]  Yeah, yeah.
[24:49.680 --> 24:54.680]  He's like one of three or four wrestlers who were in WWE, healed with spinal stenosis,
[24:54.780 --> 24:56.200]  and now are wrestling in AEW.
[24:56.360 --> 24:56.760]  Nice.
[24:57.020 --> 24:57.740]  Brett, the Hitman Hart.
[24:58.420 --> 24:59.360]  Hitman Hart.
[25:00.420 --> 25:01.580]  Oh, here's another one.
[25:01.840 --> 25:03.720]  Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase.
[25:04.220 --> 25:04.540]  Oh!
[25:04.740 --> 25:05.960]  Current felon.
[25:06.160 --> 25:06.540]  What?
[25:06.760 --> 25:14.120]  Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase for defrauding the state of Mississippi out of millions,
[25:14.400 --> 25:14.820]  I think?
[25:14.820 --> 25:15.860]  Sounds like a Million Dollar Man.
[25:16.160 --> 25:17.700]  Oh, you should definitely look into it.
[25:17.740 --> 25:19.300]  Check out what's up with Ted DiBiase.
[25:19.960 --> 25:20.020]  Dang.
[25:20.900 --> 25:22.420]  Who was that dude that he hung out with, Virgil?
[25:22.540 --> 25:23.120]  Virgil, yeah.
[25:23.120 --> 25:23.860]  Are they still buddies?
[25:24.200 --> 25:24.520]  No.
[25:25.100 --> 25:25.380]  What?
[25:25.780 --> 25:29.080]  That's how you become the Million Dollar Man, is you get a million dollars.
[25:29.820 --> 25:31.800]  Sarray, she left, and she's back in Japan.
[25:32.160 --> 25:32.540]  Oh, okay.
[25:32.540 --> 25:33.020]  Yeah, good for her.
[25:33.160 --> 25:33.540]  Good for her.
[25:34.020 --> 25:35.620]  Are these all former people?
[25:35.860 --> 25:37.200]  That one is now Emma.
[25:37.380 --> 25:38.100]  Yeah, she left.
[25:38.540 --> 25:39.320]  Not too long ago.
[25:39.340 --> 25:40.680]  It's like, she left, she left, she left.
[25:40.680 --> 25:40.980]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:41.100 --> 25:42.240]  It happens a lot.
[25:42.320 --> 25:42.840]  Cracked Ice.
[25:42.840 --> 25:45.200]  Oh, Ray Mysterio, Cracked Ice.
[25:45.480 --> 25:46.320]  Gotta love that.
[25:46.760 --> 25:47.160]  Booyaka.
[25:47.960 --> 25:49.060]  Everybody, everybody loves him.
[25:49.120 --> 25:49.820]  Oh, here, how about this?
[25:50.340 --> 25:51.520]  Stone Cold Steve Austin.
[25:51.520 --> 25:52.040]  Oh, yeah.
[25:52.040 --> 25:52.380]  Oh, yeah.
[25:53.160 --> 25:53.560]  Parallel.
[25:53.600 --> 25:55.980]  Crack a couple of cold ones with old Stone Cold.
[25:56.620 --> 25:57.460]  That's a pretty good song.
[25:57.460 --> 25:58.440]  Is he still in politics?
[25:59.160 --> 25:59.700]  Stone Cold?
[25:59.720 --> 26:00.500]  Wasn't he in politics?
[26:00.760 --> 26:01.000]  No.
[26:01.100 --> 26:01.840]  Who was in politics?
[26:01.920 --> 26:02.900]  Jesse Ventura.
[26:03.180 --> 26:04.200]  Sorry, they look a lot alike.
[26:04.340 --> 26:06.980]  Stone Cold Steve Austin makes beer, and I went to a wrestling show.
[26:06.980 --> 26:07.360]  Drinks beer.
[26:07.540 --> 26:07.740]  Yeah.
[26:08.720 --> 26:13.840]  They had a thing called the Attitude Era Combo, and it was Stone Cold Steve Austin's beer
[26:13.840 --> 26:16.460]  with The Rock's tequila for ten bucks.
[26:16.920 --> 26:18.640]  And I was like, if I wasn't driving, man.
[26:20.140 --> 26:20.940]  Nikita Lyons.
[26:21.140 --> 26:22.000]  Nikita Lyons?
[26:22.100 --> 26:22.300]  Yeah.
[26:22.640 --> 26:24.060]  She wrestles in NXT.
[26:24.320 --> 26:25.060]  I think she's hurt right now.
[26:25.160 --> 26:25.500]  Also an animal.
[26:27.380 --> 26:28.120]  Oh, here you go.
[26:29.240 --> 26:30.120]  Solo Sakoa.
[26:30.400 --> 26:31.800]  He's on TV all the time.
[26:31.860 --> 26:33.900]  He's in The Bloodline with Roman Reigns.
[26:33.900 --> 26:36.980]  This card's not cut well, but...
[26:37.880 --> 26:38.780]  Bianca Belair.
[26:39.260 --> 26:40.180]  She's the EST.
[26:40.500 --> 26:43.160]  She's the strongest, the fastest, the baddest.
[26:43.540 --> 26:44.040]  She's awesome.
[26:44.740 --> 26:45.960]  What does EST stand for?
[26:46.080 --> 26:46.740]  EST, the best.
[26:47.600 --> 26:49.120]  Oh, the best is the best.
[26:49.360 --> 26:50.680]  Yeah, the biggest, the baddest.
[26:51.160 --> 26:55.580]  She has really, really long hair that's in like a big braid, and she'll fucking whip people.
[26:55.580 --> 26:56.320]  Oh, that's cool.
[26:56.420 --> 26:56.840]  So cool.
[26:56.960 --> 26:57.440]  King Royal.
[26:57.620 --> 26:58.880]  There we go again.
[26:58.880 --> 26:59.500]  There he is.
[26:59.660 --> 27:00.740]  The million dollar man again.
[27:02.160 --> 27:03.640]  And Brock Lesnar.
[27:03.980 --> 27:05.000]  Oh, that's cool.
[27:05.260 --> 27:10.860]  That's when he drove a tractor down to the ring, like a bulldozer thing, and then like tipped the ring over, and then...
[27:12.860 --> 27:14.160]  Sleeveless shirt, cowboy hat.
[27:14.480 --> 27:14.960]  Did he really?
[27:15.100 --> 27:15.740]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[27:17.420 --> 27:18.300]  Lisa Lyonne.
[27:18.680 --> 27:19.880]  NXT wrestler.
[27:20.200 --> 27:21.260]  I've only seen her a couple of times.
[27:22.120 --> 27:23.100]  Oh, there's one.
[27:23.600 --> 27:24.140]  Cora Jade.
[27:24.360 --> 27:26.980]  She's gonna be a really big star.
[27:27.780 --> 27:28.580]  Holy shit.
[27:29.540 --> 27:30.700]  Actually, let me give you this one.
[27:31.060 --> 27:31.760]  Mr. Perfect.
[27:32.560 --> 27:33.400]  Kurt Hennig.
[27:33.640 --> 27:34.060]  Awesome.
[27:34.500 --> 27:35.280]  Love Mr. Perfect.
[27:36.480 --> 27:37.440]  What's going on here?
[27:37.440 --> 27:38.840]  Oh, it's Ron Van Dam.
[27:39.180 --> 27:39.800]  That's awesome.
[27:39.920 --> 27:40.640]  Green prison parallel.
[27:40.820 --> 27:42.400]  He's doing the Van Dam split.
[27:42.960 --> 27:44.380]  Is he related to Ron?
[27:44.380 --> 27:45.300]  No, no.
[27:45.680 --> 27:47.260]  It's just, they look similar.
[27:47.420 --> 27:49.100]  In wrestling, it was like, you do that.
[27:49.520 --> 27:51.780]  Does Van Dam stand for...
[27:53.380 --> 27:54.300]  It's the EST.
[27:56.360 --> 27:57.880]  He smokes a lot of weed.
[27:57.880 --> 27:59.440]  That just doesn't look comfortable.
[27:59.660 --> 28:00.280]  Yeah, he's pretty cool.
[28:00.360 --> 28:01.120]  Rick Boogs.
[28:01.200 --> 28:01.960]  Rick Boogs.
[28:02.100 --> 28:03.420]  He used to wrestle there.
[28:03.520 --> 28:03.800]  Not anymore.
[28:05.280 --> 28:06.080]  Angelo Dawkins.
[28:06.360 --> 28:06.840]  He still wrestles.
[28:06.900 --> 28:07.400]  He's doing good.
[28:07.560 --> 28:08.860]  He's on SmackDown now, I think.
[28:08.960 --> 28:09.300]  Okay.
[28:09.480 --> 28:10.540]  Where'd he go, Angelo Dawkins?
[28:11.020 --> 28:12.120]  I don't know this person.
[28:12.320 --> 28:12.560]  Wow.
[28:12.700 --> 28:13.680]  Karrion Kross.
[28:14.440 --> 28:16.780]  And his wife and their evil.
[28:17.160 --> 28:20.180]  They're like, oh, time's ticking and they're gonna beat you up.
[28:22.920 --> 28:23.720]  Shinsuke Nakamura.
[28:24.280 --> 28:26.520]  He's awesome in New Japan Pro Wrestling.
[28:26.520 --> 28:27.380]  He's been in WWE.
[28:27.660 --> 28:28.800]  He's a very good wrestler.
[28:28.880 --> 28:29.680]  He loves to surf.
[28:30.280 --> 28:30.680]  Oh.
[28:30.840 --> 28:31.620]  I like to surf.
[28:31.620 --> 28:32.240]  That's a fun fact.
[28:32.460 --> 28:35.520]  Are you more WWE or...
[28:36.120 --> 28:36.520]  AEW.
[28:36.560 --> 28:36.960]  AEW.
[28:37.320 --> 28:38.400]  You're more of an AEW.
[28:38.680 --> 28:40.740]  Seems like a lot of people have left WWE.
[28:41.320 --> 28:45.260]  Yeah, but there are people that are going over from AEW to WWE.
[28:45.580 --> 28:46.140]  It's nice.
[28:46.320 --> 28:48.420]  Everyone makes more money and that's all you're really looking for.
[28:48.580 --> 28:48.760]  Yeah.
[28:49.180 --> 28:50.540]  More places to work, baby.
[28:50.920 --> 28:51.200]  All right.
[28:51.740 --> 28:53.880]  Let's crack open some of these Decision 92.
[28:54.240 --> 28:55.220]  What am I gonna do?
[28:55.800 --> 28:58.640]  Now, here's where we get Ross Perot on card auto.
[28:58.820 --> 28:59.120]  Yeah.
[28:59.300 --> 28:59.580]  Goddamn.
[28:59.680 --> 29:01.800]  Yeah, we see if we've solved any of these problems.
[29:02.520 --> 29:02.920]  Watergate.
[29:03.540 --> 29:04.660]  That's Richard Milhouse Nixon.
[29:04.780 --> 29:08.220]  One of the things I learned about Emily when I first started dating her is that she was
[29:08.760 --> 29:11.220]  really into Nixon because she had like seven pictures of Nixon.
[29:11.380 --> 29:16.780]  No, I had my dad's dartboard from when he was younger that was a face of Nixon.
[29:17.240 --> 29:17.320]  Yeah.
[29:17.860 --> 29:19.860]  And then I had some random...
[29:19.860 --> 29:20.660]  A framed picture of him.
[29:20.760 --> 29:24.960]  No, it was like some random photo that was like of a crowd and it was him.
[29:24.960 --> 29:25.540]  It was...
[29:26.640 --> 29:29.160]  Did Nixon have the presidential library in...
[29:29.160 --> 29:29.660]  Yerba Linda.
[29:29.900 --> 29:30.180]  Yeah.
[29:30.260 --> 29:30.420]  Yeah.
[29:30.660 --> 29:31.420]  What the fuck?
[29:31.880 --> 29:33.440]  So I got hit by a car and I had to go to that hospital.
[29:33.700 --> 29:34.400]  You got hit by a car?
[29:34.520 --> 29:34.740]  Yeah.
[29:35.480 --> 29:37.160]  I got run over by a car.
[29:37.280 --> 29:38.120]  How fast was it going?
[29:40.260 --> 29:40.980]  Zero to...
[29:41.460 --> 29:44.880]  Starting to roll and it was on a bike and it just rolled over me and I just kept going,
[29:45.120 --> 29:45.360]  Stop!
[29:45.520 --> 29:45.700]  Ah!
[29:45.700 --> 29:45.980]  Stop!
[29:46.100 --> 29:46.360]  Ah!
[29:47.860 --> 29:51.220]  This one's some sort of a parallel gold foil between me and Nixon.
[29:52.020 --> 29:53.960]  But it's all fucked up, so...
[29:53.960 --> 29:55.200]  It's all fucked up.
[29:55.200 --> 29:57.120]  Speaking of all fucked up our country, gay rights.
[29:57.120 --> 29:57.860]  Hey, gay rights.
[29:58.180 --> 29:58.880]  92, major issue.
[29:58.880 --> 29:59.200]  We did it.
[29:59.220 --> 30:00.580]  I feel like they're always under assault.
[30:01.780 --> 30:02.500]  The Democrat.
[30:04.060 --> 30:04.960]  These cards suck.
[30:05.900 --> 30:07.260]  Oh, there you go, sexual harassment.
[30:07.460 --> 30:09.200]  Yeah, the sexual harassment card.
[30:10.560 --> 30:11.500]  Still in power.
[30:11.540 --> 30:11.940]  There he is.
[30:11.940 --> 30:13.160]  Still being a piece of shit.
[30:13.380 --> 30:14.000]  There you go.
[30:14.280 --> 30:16.580]  Who could have seen that coming from 92?
[30:17.800 --> 30:18.200]  What was that?
[30:18.600 --> 30:19.680]  30 years ago now?
[30:20.020 --> 30:21.280]  Good lord, that was a long time ago.
[30:21.480 --> 30:23.700]  And he's still being a piece of shit.
[30:24.180 --> 30:25.700]  He's your Supreme Court Justice.
[30:25.840 --> 30:27.140]  He's your Supreme Court Justice.
[30:27.520 --> 30:29.500]  All right, what's next, Geoff?
[30:29.700 --> 30:30.440]  What is next?
[30:30.440 --> 30:32.120]  It's 4.30 on the dot.
[30:32.540 --> 30:33.160]  Halfway through.
[30:33.240 --> 30:36.160]  That means in less than half an hour we're going to open this thing.
[30:36.300 --> 30:38.240]  A mini helmet that we think is signed.
[30:38.580 --> 30:38.880]  We don't know.
[30:38.880 --> 30:39.400]  It'll be signed.
[30:39.540 --> 30:40.140]  It's signed!
[30:40.600 --> 30:42.760]  Let's open up this pack of Bowman 2023.
[30:43.500 --> 30:44.120]  See what's in there.
[30:44.200 --> 30:44.360]  Okay.
[30:44.600 --> 30:44.820]  Baseball.
[30:45.240 --> 30:45.500]  Nice.
[30:45.860 --> 30:46.640]  Bryce Harper.
[30:46.840 --> 30:47.260]  O'Neal Cruz.
[30:48.380 --> 30:48.920]  Josh Jung.
[30:49.900 --> 30:50.780]  CJ Abrams.
[30:50.880 --> 30:51.920]  Hosea Brayu.
[30:52.140 --> 30:53.000]  Left the White Sox.
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.660]  I can't blame him, but I'm still bummed about it.
[30:54.720 --> 30:56.200]  Nolan Jones.
[30:57.280 --> 30:58.000]  Elijah Green.
[30:58.160 --> 30:58.620]  Top prospect.
[30:58.760 --> 30:59.420]  That's a cute card.
[30:59.920 --> 31:00.360]  Yes, sir.
[31:01.120 --> 31:01.480]  Mercedes.
[31:02.680 --> 31:04.100]  Here's a Bowman first.
[31:04.520 --> 31:05.280]  Junior Caminero.
[31:06.340 --> 31:08.440]  We've got the silver Kenny Gomez.
[31:08.860 --> 31:10.340]  And then a first Geofferson Rojas.
[31:10.540 --> 31:12.600]  We'll go ahead and sleeve, I guess, those.
[31:12.700 --> 31:13.240]  Yes, sir.
[31:13.440 --> 31:13.700]  Yeah.
[31:14.300 --> 31:15.380]  Oh, I was going to show this.
[31:15.700 --> 31:15.840]  Okay.
[31:16.060 --> 31:18.560]  Every once in a while, we go to Walmart or a store.
[31:19.240 --> 31:20.240]  They discount cards.
[31:20.420 --> 31:22.060]  So these are typically around about $25 or $30.
[31:22.420 --> 31:22.560]  Yeah.
[31:22.620 --> 31:22.980]  So I found this card.
[31:23.700 --> 31:24.800]  It's Alan and Gintra.
[31:24.840 --> 31:26.040]  Oh, these Alan and Gintra cards are cool.
[31:26.080 --> 31:26.840]  I like Alan and Gintra.
[31:27.060 --> 31:29.760]  So we have a never-ending supply of them now.
[31:29.840 --> 31:30.140]  Nice.
[31:30.360 --> 31:30.540]  Rips.
[31:31.240 --> 31:35.420]  So I thought we'd see what a discounted pack from Walmart gets us.
[31:35.420 --> 31:41.180]  Now, I learned from you, of course, you know, we get the big fat rip card on top?
[31:41.500 --> 31:43.360]  But they make little baby rip cards.
[31:43.480 --> 31:43.640]  Yeah.
[31:43.960 --> 31:44.820]  They can also be in packs.
[31:44.840 --> 31:46.540]  And so I need that as well.
[31:46.540 --> 31:47.080]  Put this in the pack.
[31:47.100 --> 31:47.380]  Okay.
[31:47.800 --> 31:48.160]  Let's see.
[31:48.520 --> 31:49.900]  We'll open up a couple of these fuckers.
[31:50.120 --> 31:51.340]  That pack sack, by the way.
[31:51.340 --> 31:53.560]  I think we're going to go through that on Extra Life.
[31:53.840 --> 31:59.600]  Extra Life is coming up, and I think that's going to be our contribution is we'll be there and opening pack sack cards.
[31:59.740 --> 32:00.600]  Pop that pack.
[32:00.680 --> 32:00.840]  Yep.
[32:00.960 --> 32:01.640]  Let's do it.
[32:01.820 --> 32:02.260]  What we got?
[32:03.720 --> 32:04.160]  Uh...
[32:04.880 --> 32:05.640]  This kid.
[32:06.460 --> 32:07.000]  What the fuck?
[32:07.220 --> 32:07.720]  Who's that?
[32:08.120 --> 32:08.200]  Gryce.
[32:08.680 --> 32:08.960]  Gryce?
[32:09.300 --> 32:09.920]  Oh, man.
[32:09.940 --> 32:10.260]  Is that...
[32:10.260 --> 32:10.440]  Dude.
[32:10.660 --> 32:13.220]  This is Hobby Wonderkin Blake Gryce.
[32:13.340 --> 32:14.280]  Oh, we got Gryce.
[32:14.300 --> 32:17.340]  He was only nine years old when he began recording his YouTube videos.
[32:18.080 --> 32:18.520]  This...
[32:18.520 --> 32:19.400]  Hawks of Top Squad.
[32:19.440 --> 32:20.340]  Guys, we got...
[32:20.340 --> 32:21.440]  We got Gryce.
[32:21.600 --> 32:24.300]  We have a Gryce, but we don't have a Ramsey.
[32:24.580 --> 32:26.040]  Gryce base card, guys.
[32:26.080 --> 32:28.120]  We have Fitness Influencer Kettle Tool.
[32:28.420 --> 32:28.900]  Wow.
[32:29.360 --> 32:29.840]  Wow.
[32:30.280 --> 32:32.400]  We have Nathaniel Lowell.
[32:32.540 --> 32:33.020]  Okay.
[32:33.260 --> 32:34.780]  He's no Gryce.
[32:34.840 --> 32:35.640]  Famous Rivals.
[32:35.840 --> 32:36.740]  Inky's Red Socks.
[32:37.480 --> 32:37.760]  The...
[32:38.280 --> 32:39.000]  The grounds are rivals?
[32:39.000 --> 32:39.880]  CJ Gron Mini.
[32:40.020 --> 32:40.980]  Oh, that's a...
[32:40.980 --> 32:41.200]  Yeah.
[32:42.040 --> 32:42.760]  That's a...
[32:42.760 --> 32:43.660]  The groundskeepers are fighting.
[32:43.960 --> 32:45.120]  You got a CJ Kron right there?
[32:45.200 --> 32:46.040]  Yeah, that's a parallel.
[32:46.280 --> 32:47.240]  The black border.
[32:47.320 --> 32:47.880]  Ooh, that good?
[32:47.960 --> 32:48.300]  Yeah.
[32:48.300 --> 32:49.040]  That's a cute one.
[32:49.060 --> 32:49.700]  And then...
[32:49.700 --> 32:50.080]  What is this?
[32:50.280 --> 32:51.000]  George Springer.
[32:51.160 --> 32:51.580]  Let's see what we got.
[32:52.120 --> 32:52.200]  Boo!
[32:53.180 --> 32:53.540]  Boo!
[32:54.520 --> 32:55.720]  I don't know who we're booing.
[32:55.880 --> 32:56.240]  I'm just...
[32:56.240 --> 32:56.700]  George Springer.
[32:56.840 --> 32:57.080]  Cheater.
[32:57.280 --> 32:57.480]  Boo.
[32:57.680 --> 32:57.920]  Boo.
[32:58.260 --> 32:59.280]  Cheater on...
[32:59.280 --> 32:59.600]  Personal?
[33:00.860 --> 33:01.580]  Holy shit.
[33:01.680 --> 33:04.000]  It's not often that you get a hit in a blaster of...
[33:04.000 --> 33:04.260]  For real?
[33:04.360 --> 33:04.640]  Yeah.
[33:04.720 --> 33:05.000]  Alright.
[33:05.240 --> 33:06.740]  On a discounted deck, too.
[33:06.780 --> 33:07.740]  On a $17 deck.
[33:07.760 --> 33:11.440]  I mean, I know we already got Gryce, but you're gonna have to really blow my socks off if you
[33:11.440 --> 33:12.280]  think it's gonna be worth it.
[33:12.380 --> 33:13.080]  Here's Will Smith.
[33:13.420 --> 33:13.580]  Oh.
[33:13.700 --> 33:13.860]  Mini.
[33:14.040 --> 33:14.380]  That's fine.
[33:14.380 --> 33:14.440]  That's fine.
[33:14.760 --> 33:15.220]  David Will Smith.
[33:15.220 --> 33:16.260]  It's not the one.
[33:16.780 --> 33:17.220]  It's not the one.
[33:17.220 --> 33:18.440]  It's not the one we learned too much about.
[33:20.040 --> 33:20.920]  Against your will.
[33:20.920 --> 33:21.180]  Against your will.
[33:21.280 --> 33:21.420]  Yeah.
[33:21.640 --> 33:22.240]  I don't know.
[33:22.360 --> 33:23.080]  Roger Clemens.
[33:23.440 --> 33:23.620]  Boo!
[33:24.120 --> 33:24.560]  Yeah.
[33:24.780 --> 33:25.460]  We don't like him either?
[33:26.360 --> 33:27.840]  I mean, great baseball player.
[33:27.960 --> 33:29.480]  Kind of a piece of shit as a human.
[33:29.700 --> 33:30.080]  Eww.
[33:30.220 --> 33:30.920]  I would say.
[33:31.040 --> 33:31.200]  Yeah.
[33:31.680 --> 33:31.900]  Yeah.
[33:32.300 --> 33:32.740]  Okay.
[33:33.180 --> 33:33.740]  I'll take your word.
[33:34.480 --> 33:35.360]  Manny Machado.
[33:35.580 --> 33:35.820]  Hey!
[33:36.740 --> 33:37.520]  My guy right there.
[33:37.540 --> 33:38.080]  He's my captain.
[33:38.520 --> 33:39.740]  And then...
[33:40.560 --> 33:42.360]  A Brandon Lowe autograph.
[33:42.620 --> 33:43.200]  On four.
[33:43.340 --> 33:43.660]  Whoa!
[33:44.900 --> 33:45.340]  Really?
[33:45.780 --> 33:45.900]  Yeah.
[33:46.060 --> 33:47.100]  Holy shit.
[33:47.320 --> 33:47.620]  Yeah.
[33:47.900 --> 33:48.200]  On card.
[33:48.200 --> 33:49.940]  You should sleeve that one fast.
[33:50.060 --> 33:50.720]  I have these.
[33:50.720 --> 33:51.460]  Holy shit.
[33:52.020 --> 33:53.400]  That's a really great card.
[33:53.400 --> 33:54.620]  That's a good card.
[33:54.720 --> 33:55.540]  It's a shiny card too.
[33:55.600 --> 33:56.900]  To get 17 fucking dollars.
[33:57.120 --> 33:57.460]  Wow.
[33:58.360 --> 33:59.160]  We'll sleeve that.
[33:59.720 --> 33:59.780]  On card.
[33:59.780 --> 34:01.060]  Do I double sleeve it?
[34:01.640 --> 34:02.140]  No, just one.
[34:02.380 --> 34:02.620]  We'll...
[34:02.620 --> 34:02.900]  Oh, yeah.
[34:03.860 --> 34:04.300]  We'll...
[34:04.300 --> 34:05.060]  I think you could...
[34:05.060 --> 34:07.120]  I think you can regular sleeve it and we'll figure it out later.
[34:07.280 --> 34:09.820]  If you grab Grice also and just sleeve Grice.
[34:09.980 --> 34:11.060]  That'll fit in the top loader.
[34:11.820 --> 34:12.840]  Grice in the top loader?
[34:12.840 --> 34:13.720]  Dang, yeah.
[34:13.740 --> 34:14.840]  Do you think we can PSA...
[34:15.420 --> 34:15.720]  Mullins.
[34:15.820 --> 34:16.840]  Do you think we can PSA grade...
[34:18.460 --> 34:18.820]  Grice?
[34:18.820 --> 34:19.500]  It doesn't fit in there.
[34:19.560 --> 34:20.380]  I'm not gonna touch it.
[34:20.520 --> 34:20.860]  I'm scared.
[34:21.120 --> 34:21.620]  Okay, that's fine.
[34:21.800 --> 34:22.020]  Just...
[34:22.580 --> 34:22.940]  Okay.
[34:24.120 --> 34:25.360]  I told you, he's spicy.
[34:25.820 --> 34:26.340]  I'm not.
[34:26.400 --> 34:27.420]  He's so spicy.
[34:28.080 --> 34:28.800]  Hey, Strasburg.
[34:28.880 --> 34:29.540]  I think he's retiring.
[34:29.860 --> 34:30.900]  And Will Smith again.
[34:31.380 --> 34:32.260]  Will Smith cards.
[34:32.400 --> 34:33.100]  This is Bradley Zimmer.
[34:33.660 --> 34:33.980]  Hey.
[34:34.320 --> 34:36.360]  Mariano Rivera pitching a gym.
[34:36.680 --> 34:36.980]  Nice.
[34:37.040 --> 34:38.520]  And then that's CJ Abrams, bass rookie.
[34:38.600 --> 34:38.800]  Nice.
[34:39.260 --> 34:39.320]  Cool.
[34:39.880 --> 34:40.260]  I'll tell you what.
[34:40.260 --> 34:41.840]  We'll open one more pack of these.
[34:41.840 --> 34:42.060]  Okay.
[34:42.060 --> 34:42.700]  Only you pick.
[34:44.980 --> 34:45.500]  This one.
[34:45.620 --> 34:45.740]  All right.
[34:45.860 --> 34:47.620]  We'll save the rest for some other time.
[34:48.840 --> 34:49.160]  These are...
[34:49.160 --> 34:49.920]  This is a pretty cool pack.
[34:49.980 --> 34:50.860]  I like the Allen Ginter cards.
[34:50.940 --> 34:51.960]  I love them.
[34:52.080 --> 34:53.160]  They're quickly becoming my favorite.
[34:53.280 --> 34:53.760]  Yeah, me too.
[34:53.820 --> 34:54.380]  You got Grice.
[34:54.480 --> 34:57.480]  We're also gonna get a Grice, an Encard, and a Falcon.
[34:57.860 --> 34:58.440]  And a Chesky.
[34:58.720 --> 34:59.420]  Here we got a...
[34:59.420 --> 34:59.680]  DeGrom.
[34:59.760 --> 35:00.620]  Jacob DeGrom.
[35:00.760 --> 35:02.340]  This is also a parallel, I believe.
[35:02.540 --> 35:02.920]  The brown.
[35:03.200 --> 35:03.540]  That's awesome.
[35:03.760 --> 35:04.560]  Remember when he was on the Mets?
[35:04.700 --> 35:04.860]  Anyway.
[35:05.380 --> 35:09.100]  So were all the cards, like, back in the olden times, little like this?
[35:09.620 --> 35:10.680]  I don't know where that came from.
[35:10.680 --> 35:11.060]  Tobacco cards were.
[35:11.060 --> 35:12.020]  Tobacco cards.
[35:12.100 --> 35:13.040]  Would they come in a pack of cigarettes?
[35:13.320 --> 35:14.620]  Yeah, they would come, like, in a pack of cigarettes.
[35:14.740 --> 35:16.300]  Or in a pack of, like, loose tobacco.
[35:16.540 --> 35:18.140]  They should start doing that with cigarettes again.
[35:18.140 --> 35:21.100]  They should just be, like, everything is just, like, the camel.
[35:21.360 --> 35:21.500]  Yeah.
[35:21.900 --> 35:22.220]  Oh!
[35:22.340 --> 35:23.200]  I would buy those.
[35:23.320 --> 35:23.620]  Yeah, yeah.
[35:23.920 --> 35:25.880]  Here we have soccer star Sam Mewis.
[35:25.880 --> 35:27.260]  Gonna get back into camel crushes.
[35:27.360 --> 35:27.780]  Hell yeah.
[35:28.100 --> 35:29.160]  Mitt Merrifeld.
[35:30.940 --> 35:31.640]  That is...
[35:31.640 --> 35:32.440]  That's creepy.
[35:33.980 --> 35:36.780]  Here we got Brooks Robinson, 1949 NL MVP.
[35:37.140 --> 35:37.420]  Nice.
[35:37.620 --> 35:39.540]  And then Colton Welker, base rookie.
[35:39.540 --> 35:40.000]  Okay.
[35:40.740 --> 35:42.660]  All right, what should we do next, guys?
[35:42.740 --> 35:43.120]  What do you feel...
[35:43.120 --> 35:43.860]  You know what?
[35:44.140 --> 35:44.480]  What's that?
[35:44.960 --> 35:45.200]  Oh!
[35:45.460 --> 35:48.220]  I'm on a sports kick lately, but I bought these.
[35:48.400 --> 35:48.800]  What are they?
[35:48.820 --> 35:52.380]  This is a hobby box of Star Wars Galaxy 2023.
[35:52.780 --> 35:54.360]  I've never opened up Star Wars cards before.
[35:54.360 --> 35:54.680]  That's cool.
[35:55.500 --> 35:56.300]  Is Galaxy...
[35:56.300 --> 35:58.800]  Is this beyond the, like, regular movies?
[35:59.400 --> 35:59.660]  I...
[35:59.660 --> 36:01.220]  Because isn't that the guy from...
[36:01.220 --> 36:02.000]  That's Boba Fett.
[36:02.120 --> 36:02.340]  Yeah.
[36:02.620 --> 36:02.840]  Yeah.
[36:02.880 --> 36:04.100]  And then he has his own show now?
[36:04.780 --> 36:05.160]  He...
[36:05.160 --> 36:06.100]  The Book of Boba Fett.
[36:06.240 --> 36:08.120]  I feel like everyone has a show now on Disney+.
[36:08.120 --> 36:08.980]  Unfortunately, yeah.
[36:09.040 --> 36:11.120]  They really run this franchise into the ground.
[36:11.320 --> 36:11.860]  Yeah, it's pretty sad.
[36:11.920 --> 36:14.060]  The only thing I know about Star Wars I learned from Family Guy.
[36:14.240 --> 36:17.700]  So I'm excited to learn about what Star Wars Galaxy is.
[36:17.820 --> 36:19.560]  It's really a monkey paw situation, huh?
[36:19.580 --> 36:21.360]  Where people went, like, I wish there was more Star Wars.
[36:21.500 --> 36:23.540]  Even though it just kind of, like, curled.
[36:23.660 --> 36:23.900]  Yeah.
[36:24.080 --> 36:24.440]  Oh!
[36:25.060 --> 36:25.980]  Careful what you ask for.
[36:26.960 --> 36:28.140]  You're inundated with it.
[36:28.800 --> 36:31.240]  The same four stories over and over again.
[36:31.460 --> 36:32.300]  Put that pack out.
[36:32.320 --> 36:32.940]  Nice problems.
[36:33.060 --> 36:35.140]  I mean, whatever we open here, if we don't want it,
[36:35.180 --> 36:37.520]  I'm sure Fisher in the control room will be really stoked about it.
[36:38.740 --> 36:39.340]  Let's see.
[36:39.460 --> 36:39.900]  Let's see what we get.
[36:39.960 --> 36:40.760]  I don't even know what to expect.
[36:40.860 --> 36:42.640]  This top's chrome, so it's going to be pretty.
[36:42.860 --> 36:43.100]  Okay.
[36:43.620 --> 36:44.020]  Nice.
[36:44.120 --> 36:45.180]  Probably four cards a pack.
[36:45.280 --> 36:45.480]  Yeah.
[36:45.860 --> 36:50.060]  The only card I want is Han Solo fighting against the giant otter from the books.
[36:50.180 --> 36:51.260]  The torture droid.
[36:51.380 --> 36:54.460]  I want the little things that are in the woods.
[36:54.940 --> 36:55.160]  Ewoks.
[36:55.240 --> 36:55.640]  Ewoks.
[36:55.740 --> 36:55.920]  Yeah.
[36:56.280 --> 36:56.900]  The little.
[36:57.040 --> 36:57.880]  Oh, shit.
[36:58.380 --> 36:59.820]  He's all yours, bounty hunter.
[36:59.940 --> 37:00.200]  Oh!
[37:01.080 --> 37:02.360]  Han Solo in carbonite.
[37:02.420 --> 37:02.860]  Pretty cool.
[37:02.960 --> 37:03.320]  Nice.
[37:03.420 --> 37:06.420]  In Family Guy, it's his butt, and as it defrosts, he farts.
[37:06.420 --> 37:07.400]  Oh, here's it.
[37:07.820 --> 37:08.580]  That's what happens.
[37:08.580 --> 37:09.580]  Geoff, that's what happens in Family Guy.
[37:10.340 --> 37:12.320]  Geoff, Geoff, that's what happens in Family Guy.
[37:12.560 --> 37:12.980]  That's what I know.
[37:13.080 --> 37:14.280]  Do or do not is Yoda.
[37:14.540 --> 37:15.120]  That's cool.
[37:15.340 --> 37:15.800]  Yelling it.
[37:15.800 --> 37:16.860]  Is that before he does yoga?
[37:17.200 --> 37:17.560]  Yeah.
[37:18.680 --> 37:21.240]  Get it out of the swamp, buddy.
[37:21.680 --> 37:22.940]  Got to fly away and save people.
[37:23.520 --> 37:24.480]  Ambush from above.
[37:24.620 --> 37:24.960]  There you go.
[37:25.080 --> 37:26.320]  Hey, there's my little Ewoks.
[37:27.000 --> 37:27.600]  Hell yeah.
[37:27.700 --> 37:29.100]  Being a little sneaky is fat.
[37:29.580 --> 37:31.040]  Refractor, I guess is what they would probably call it.
[37:31.100 --> 37:31.560]  Yeah, there you go.
[37:31.560 --> 37:32.180]  Silver refractor.
[37:32.900 --> 37:34.460]  This is what I'm looking for.
[37:34.900 --> 37:36.180]  If you can show that on the camera.
[37:36.760 --> 37:38.740]  If we can find that, that would be awesome.
[37:38.800 --> 37:39.220]  Is that for real?
[37:39.580 --> 37:41.880]  It's from one of the Extended Universe books.
[37:42.080 --> 37:44.320]  It's Han Solo fighting a giant otter monster.
[37:44.520 --> 37:44.820]  Wow.
[37:45.820 --> 37:46.800]  That's what I'm looking for.
[37:46.800 --> 37:47.900]  He had that ready to go.
[37:48.440 --> 37:49.540]  I'm excited about it.
[37:50.240 --> 37:51.500]  Wow, I'm going to put this up here.
[37:51.500 --> 37:52.740]  I hope we get the otter monster.
[37:52.900 --> 37:53.380]  Me too.
[37:53.520 --> 37:54.820]  These are fucking cool so far.
[37:54.980 --> 37:55.560]  I'm not even going to lie.
[37:55.560 --> 37:56.060]  Yeah, they're not bad.
[37:56.300 --> 37:57.080]  Look at this.
[37:57.160 --> 37:57.440]  Not bad.
[37:58.140 --> 38:01.220]  This is when Obi-Wan's talking to Luke when he's fucking dying out there.
[38:01.320 --> 38:03.600]  Is that when he cuts open the thing and sleeps in the gut?
[38:03.740 --> 38:04.560]  The Tauntaun?
[38:04.660 --> 38:05.880]  It's definitely on Hoth.
[38:06.540 --> 38:06.940]  Yeah.
[38:08.720 --> 38:09.120]  Uh...
[38:09.120 --> 38:10.080]  Dawn of the Rebellion.
[38:10.320 --> 38:10.560]  Okay.
[38:10.720 --> 38:12.160]  Oh, no, we have two Silvers back to back.
[38:12.180 --> 38:14.140]  Is that guy, like, traffic control?
[38:14.460 --> 38:14.640]  Yes.
[38:14.960 --> 38:15.540]  Yes, he is.
[38:15.880 --> 38:16.760]  That's 100% what he is.
[38:16.760 --> 38:17.600]  Going in, TIE Fighters.
[38:17.900 --> 38:18.960]  Sneaking around danger.
[38:19.280 --> 38:20.220]  Oh, that's pretty close.
[38:20.280 --> 38:23.040]  It looks like he's getting ready to fight a big otter monster.
[38:23.040 --> 38:25.140]  This is a silver refractor.
[38:25.420 --> 38:27.400]  Oh, and then this is a fucking cool art card.
[38:28.220 --> 38:30.280]  Darth Vader and his Stormtrooper.
[38:30.340 --> 38:30.740]  Oh.
[38:32.160 --> 38:35.520]  That art looks like a sticker I would get in, like, eighth grade.
[38:35.520 --> 38:36.620]  To be really, really into.
[38:38.320 --> 38:39.960]  Yeah, and it's a silver refractor.
[38:40.020 --> 38:40.760]  That's fucking gorgeous.
[38:40.960 --> 38:41.380]  All right.
[38:41.860 --> 38:43.700]  I bet these are making somebody happy.
[38:44.260 --> 38:46.320]  Oh, people watching this live, they're probably going bananas.
[38:46.560 --> 38:48.300]  I thought they smelled bad on the outside.
[38:49.320 --> 38:50.220]  That's what somebody said.
[38:52.280 --> 38:53.280]  Oh, here we go.
[38:53.980 --> 38:54.780]  Lando Calrissian.
[38:55.260 --> 38:56.000]  Oh, that's a cool card.
[38:56.020 --> 38:57.120]  Probably my favorite Star Wars character.
[38:57.140 --> 38:57.480]  Oh, that's good.
[38:58.420 --> 38:59.140]  Boba Fett.
[38:59.940 --> 39:00.920]  That's the cover, huh?
[39:01.000 --> 39:01.700]  Yeah, there you go.
[39:02.100 --> 39:02.500]  Wow.
[39:03.920 --> 39:05.340]  Uh, we got an old ass Yoda.
[39:07.300 --> 39:08.100]  He's tie-tie.
[39:08.600 --> 39:09.500]  800 years old.
[39:09.640 --> 39:10.900]  He's kind of a regular Yoda, you know what I mean?
[39:10.980 --> 39:13.740]  And then some AT-STs, it looks like.
[39:14.540 --> 39:14.800]  Right?
[39:15.000 --> 39:15.320]  Oh.
[39:15.620 --> 39:16.560]  Yeah, AT-STs.
[39:17.060 --> 39:17.220]  Wow.
[39:17.240 --> 39:19.020]  Do you think Baby Yoda is going to talk like regular Yoda?
[39:19.720 --> 39:22.020]  Uh, does he talk at all in the show?
[39:22.160 --> 39:23.300]  No, I think he just makes noises.
[39:24.000 --> 39:24.320]  Yeah.
[39:24.820 --> 39:25.520]  Is he like Beaker?
[39:25.820 --> 39:26.840]  Yeah, he's like Beaker.
[39:27.200 --> 39:28.820]  Yeah, Bunsen and Beaker kind of situation.
[39:29.140 --> 39:32.000]  I was wondering if it's like a learned thing or if he talks on his own.
[39:32.000 --> 39:32.480]  Oh, like a Beaker thing.
[39:32.480 --> 39:33.200]  Yeah, if he talks backwards.
[39:33.540 --> 39:34.060]  That's a good question.
[39:34.840 --> 39:37.580]  My friend's mom had a stroke and she talked like Yoda for a couple days.
[39:37.640 --> 39:38.040]  Oh, wow.
[39:38.160 --> 39:39.140]  And she's fine now.
[39:39.200 --> 39:39.520]  I love her.
[39:39.640 --> 39:39.840]  Wow.
[39:40.260 --> 39:40.940]  Shout out to Rhonda.
[39:42.320 --> 39:43.280]  Way to go, Rhonda!
[39:43.640 --> 39:44.200]  You did it!
[39:44.660 --> 39:46.020]  But yeah, she would talk like Yoda.
[39:46.300 --> 39:47.060]  You're doing better, you are.
[39:47.160 --> 39:47.400]  Yeah.
[39:49.160 --> 39:50.440]  There's the Millennium Falcon.
[39:50.760 --> 39:55.000]  Here we have a silver refractor of Han and Chewie going nuts.
[39:55.360 --> 39:58.600]  They're looking at the playbook to figure out where the giant otter is.
[39:59.360 --> 40:02.000]  Here we have a picture of Admiral Ackbar.
[40:02.560 --> 40:02.880]  Oh!
[40:03.560 --> 40:04.200]  Watching Destruction.
[40:04.500 --> 40:04.700]  Yeah.
[40:04.860 --> 40:05.800]  And then, it's a trap.
[40:05.820 --> 40:06.700]  It's a trap, baby.
[40:06.800 --> 40:10.440]  And then a Return of the Jedi silver refractor.
[40:10.460 --> 40:11.020]  That's cool.
[40:11.180 --> 40:11.500]  Pretty.
[40:11.660 --> 40:12.600]  I really like the art on that.
[40:12.640 --> 40:16.040]  And that's the guy that's like, let the darkness take over you or some shit?
[40:16.180 --> 40:17.020]  Emperor Palpatine.
[40:17.160 --> 40:17.400]  Uh-huh.
[40:17.880 --> 40:18.520]  Emperor Palpatine.
[40:18.520 --> 40:18.980]  Those are neat.
[40:19.240 --> 40:21.720]  Chrome parallels guaranteed per box.
[40:21.820 --> 40:23.180]  We got a lot of them, I feel like.
[40:23.300 --> 40:24.340]  Let's open up one more pack.
[40:24.440 --> 40:24.600]  Okay.
[40:25.080 --> 40:25.400]  Ooh!
[40:25.540 --> 40:26.660]  Geoffrey likes it.
[40:26.880 --> 40:27.320]  Just making sure.
[40:27.400 --> 40:27.900]  I already put one in.
[40:27.940 --> 40:28.120]  Good.
[40:28.220 --> 40:28.660]  Just making sure.
[40:28.660 --> 40:31.360]  You haven't been seeing it, but I've been filling the pack sack up.
[40:31.360 --> 40:31.620]  You've been diligent?
[40:31.980 --> 40:33.460]  Yeah, I've been very diligent about it.
[40:34.080 --> 40:35.080]  I know what happens if you don't.
[40:35.300 --> 40:36.360]  The pack sack is good to us.
[40:36.440 --> 40:36.580]  Yeah.
[40:36.620 --> 40:37.240]  If you feed it.
[40:37.260 --> 40:39.020]  If we don't, it's bad to us.
[40:39.240 --> 40:40.040]  There's another Boba Fett.
[40:40.440 --> 40:40.760]  Nice.
[40:41.160 --> 40:43.800]  Oh, here we have the Death Star.
[40:44.280 --> 40:44.820]  Face, too.
[40:44.940 --> 40:45.380]  It's the second one.
[40:45.700 --> 40:49.020]  And here we have a pretty cool art card of...
[40:49.020 --> 40:49.620]  Wow!
[40:51.240 --> 40:51.380]  Weird.
[40:51.640 --> 40:53.120]  It's time to give the dog the medicine.
[40:53.680 --> 40:54.500]  No, they're dead.
[40:54.640 --> 40:55.180]  Oh, here's...
[40:55.180 --> 40:55.520]  They died.
[40:55.640 --> 40:56.540]  All of our dogs are dead now.
[40:56.540 --> 40:57.340]  All of our dogs are super dead.
[40:57.340 --> 40:59.540]  So we don't have alarms for all their medicine because they died.
[40:59.740 --> 40:59.900]  Yeah.
[41:00.800 --> 41:02.340]  Here's a numbered...
[41:03.120 --> 41:03.440]  Lobot!
[41:04.260 --> 41:05.060]  Blue parallel.
[41:05.060 --> 41:06.160]  That looks like the guy from Star Trek.
[41:06.200 --> 41:06.960]  It's Lobot!
[41:07.200 --> 41:08.320]  It's numbered for some reason.
[41:08.460 --> 41:09.260]  Numbered Lobot.
[41:09.880 --> 41:10.240]  What?
[41:10.460 --> 41:11.040]  What is he...
[41:11.040 --> 41:11.240]  What?
[41:11.480 --> 41:12.160]  I've never heard of this.
[41:12.160 --> 41:13.320]  Lobot Encarnado.
[41:14.500 --> 41:14.900]  Nice.
[41:15.520 --> 41:17.520]  Lobot Prism Cracked Ice Parallel.
[41:17.800 --> 41:18.180]  Cracked...
[41:18.180 --> 41:19.440]  What do you...
[41:19.440 --> 41:19.980]  What do you...
[41:19.980 --> 41:20.900]  How do you feel about Star Wars?
[41:21.080 --> 41:21.960]  Are you a Star Wars guy?
[41:22.200 --> 41:23.020]  I used to be.
[41:23.200 --> 41:23.420]  Really?
[41:23.500 --> 41:25.120]  Yeah, and now there's just so much...
[41:25.120 --> 41:25.280]  It's too much.
[41:25.280 --> 41:27.020]  We're missing four fucking stories.
[41:27.280 --> 41:27.940]  But, like, were you...
[41:27.940 --> 41:29.620]  Here's how we got the plans to this thing.
[41:29.740 --> 41:30.500]  Yeah, but I know what happens.
[41:30.700 --> 41:31.780]  Yeah, but here's how we did it.
[41:31.820 --> 41:32.580]  When the, like...
[41:32.580 --> 41:34.820]  You know, they had the first three that came out in, like, the 70s or whatever.
[41:35.080 --> 41:38.280]  And then they had the other ones in the 90s, 2000s?
[41:38.280 --> 41:38.300]  Yeah.
[41:38.400 --> 41:41.900]  Were you outside of your local Tinseltown waiting to go in?
[41:41.900 --> 41:42.720]  No, I was...
[41:42.720 --> 41:46.580]  I loved the original ones and then saw Phantom Menace and I was in...
[41:46.580 --> 41:48.860]  We were in, what, like, 7th or 8th grade when that came out?
[41:48.940 --> 41:52.340]  And so I went and saw that and I remember at the time thinking, like, this is okay.
[41:53.760 --> 41:54.400]  Wait a minute.
[41:54.400 --> 41:59.820]  They spend 45 minutes on this, like, car race thing and it's the Pod Racer and you're just like,
[41:59.920 --> 42:02.460]  this is not what I think Star Wars is supposed to be.
[42:02.480 --> 42:03.640]  I fell asleep in the Pod Racer.
[42:03.760 --> 42:04.000]  Really?
[42:04.420 --> 42:04.460]  Yeah.
[42:04.820 --> 42:05.040]  Heartbreaking.
[42:05.160 --> 42:05.740]  Gilded Age.
[42:06.140 --> 42:06.500]  Yay.
[42:06.500 --> 42:07.440]  We've been doing these for a while.
[42:07.640 --> 42:08.600]  We're on this history kick.
[42:08.660 --> 42:09.580]  I thought we'd see what else we got.
[42:09.580 --> 42:09.760]  Let's do it.
[42:09.980 --> 42:10.840]  Alexander Graham Bell.
[42:11.020 --> 42:14.300]  That's his original design for the phone, I assume.
[42:15.380 --> 42:16.460]  Oh, here we have the Iron Bowl.
[42:17.240 --> 42:17.540]  Oh.
[42:17.740 --> 42:18.840]  Emily, do you know what the Iron Bowl is?
[42:19.040 --> 42:20.760]  Is it football?
[42:21.120 --> 42:21.640]  It is football.
[42:21.640 --> 42:24.380]  That is the University of Alabama versus Auburn.
[42:24.480 --> 42:25.780]  Hey, I know that one.
[42:25.900 --> 42:28.340]  The greatest rivalry in sports.
[42:28.640 --> 42:28.760]  Yeah.
[42:29.020 --> 42:29.580]  According to me.
[42:29.900 --> 42:31.100]  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
[42:32.020 --> 42:33.900]  Oh, here we have Elizabeth Cody Stanton.
[42:35.220 --> 42:36.000]  Is she a hairstylist?
[42:36.680 --> 42:37.180]  What's she doing?
[42:37.460 --> 42:38.400]  She's probably styling hair.
[42:39.260 --> 42:44.880]  She was an activist, author, lecturer, philosopher of the women's rights and suffrage movements, and a hairstylist.
[42:45.640 --> 42:46.620]  Just like me.
[42:47.220 --> 42:48.040]  Oh, she's not.
[42:48.520 --> 42:49.160]  No, she's not.
[42:49.280 --> 42:50.420]  I'm like, wow, that's pretty crazy.
[42:50.480 --> 42:50.860]  I was like, wow.
[42:52.380 --> 42:54.420]  Phillip Danforth Armour.
[42:54.680 --> 42:55.180]  That's her work.
[42:55.200 --> 42:56.180]  I want to look like that.
[42:56.320 --> 42:58.720]  Here's the Washington Monument, just in case you haven't seen it.
[42:58.820 --> 42:59.200]  There it is.
[42:59.740 --> 43:01.880]  Emma Lazarus from the Lazarus Protocol.
[43:02.040 --> 43:03.100]  From the Lazarus Pit.
[43:04.380 --> 43:05.660]  Oh, Marshall Fields.
[43:05.820 --> 43:07.160]  If anybody's looking for some...
[43:07.160 --> 43:07.720]  Department of State?
[43:08.060 --> 43:08.260]  Yeah.
[43:09.220 --> 43:10.500]  Julia Dent Grant.
[43:11.320 --> 43:12.080]  I wonder what she...
[43:12.080 --> 43:12.640]  What's up with Julia?
[43:13.640 --> 43:15.920]  She was the wife of Ulysses S. Grant, right?
[43:16.040 --> 43:18.980]  I did a report on Ulysses S. Grant in middle school.
[43:20.020 --> 43:20.220]  Awesome.
[43:20.220 --> 43:22.240]  Born in Missouri to a wealthy family.
[43:22.320 --> 43:22.840]  Congrats.
[43:23.020 --> 43:23.980]  Include that in your report.
[43:24.100 --> 43:26.840]  And here we have a gold foil Dreyfus affair.
[43:27.020 --> 43:27.540]  Wow.
[43:28.940 --> 43:30.680]  It looks like he's about to drop it.
[43:30.680 --> 43:31.380]  Did he shoot him?
[43:31.900 --> 43:33.140]  Is that blood on the ground?
[43:33.220 --> 43:33.500]  Yes.
[43:34.100 --> 43:34.880]  What is it?
[43:36.820 --> 43:39.760]  It was a political and criminal justice scandal in France.
[43:39.840 --> 43:46.520]  In 1894, Jewish artillery officer Alfred Dreyfus, a graduate of the École Polytechnique,
[43:46.520 --> 43:51.520]  was convicted of treason by a military court for passing military stickers to the Germans.
[43:52.180 --> 43:53.920]  He was publicly stripped of his rank.
[43:54.100 --> 43:57.460]  His sword was symbolically broken and he was exiled to Devil's Island.
[43:57.480 --> 43:59.620]  Dude, you gotta really break a sword.
[43:59.940 --> 44:00.760]  Yeah, that's...
[44:00.760 --> 44:01.220]  Wow.
[44:01.840 --> 44:03.620]  That's the photo of what the guy's doing.
[44:03.880 --> 44:04.680]  Yeah, they're breaking a sword.
[44:04.900 --> 44:05.280]  Damn.
[44:05.540 --> 44:06.620]  Like you, Devil's Island.
[44:06.760 --> 44:07.480]  Get out of here.
[44:07.700 --> 44:08.620]  And then blood comes out.
[44:09.040 --> 44:09.380]  Damn.
[44:09.400 --> 44:09.840]  443.
[44:10.020 --> 44:11.080]  Okay, we got some time left.
[44:11.500 --> 44:13.440]  So in about, what, ten minutes?
[44:13.600 --> 44:14.160]  Something like that?
[44:14.160 --> 44:16.400]  We'll be opening the Hit Parade Helmet, mini helmet.
[44:16.640 --> 44:18.500]  Ten minutes or so, something like that.
[44:18.600 --> 44:19.360]  I'm excited to see what it is.
[44:19.500 --> 44:23.720]  We need to get a... I think we ordered a box for the Shaq ball.
[44:24.320 --> 44:25.540]  That was the last Hit Parade we opened.
[44:25.560 --> 44:27.300]  I didn't bring it, but we did order it.
[44:27.320 --> 44:27.760]  Okay, cool.
[44:28.160 --> 44:29.380]  We should put Shaq cards in it.
[44:29.960 --> 44:30.300]  Oh!
[44:30.760 --> 44:33.480]  And then this one, whatever this one is, we can collect all of his cards.
[44:33.560 --> 44:34.160]  That's a good idea.
[44:34.380 --> 44:35.680]  When we got big hits.
[44:36.800 --> 44:38.160]  What if we open...
[44:38.680 --> 44:39.160]  What you thinking?
[44:39.900 --> 44:41.440]  Let's open up a little Alan and Ginter.
[44:41.760 --> 44:42.940]  We're going back to Alan and Ginter?
[44:42.940 --> 44:44.980]  This is the hobby box, so it's different.
[44:45.120 --> 44:45.920]  We're trying to get...
[44:45.920 --> 44:46.240]  Falcon.
[44:46.440 --> 44:47.600]  We're still trying to get that Falcon card.
[44:47.620 --> 44:48.160]  That's true.
[44:48.260 --> 44:49.600]  And there's some sandwiches, too.
[44:49.700 --> 44:51.540]  And we're still trying to get you a card.
[44:51.700 --> 44:54.020]  I gotta figure this out.
[44:54.080 --> 45:00.860]  Speaking of Falcon, we saw some cool Falcon stuff that we're going to have coming out for the Fuckface podcast very soon.
[45:01.020 --> 45:03.220]  Yeah, by the way, listen to the Fuckface podcast.
[45:03.460 --> 45:03.620]  Yeah.
[45:03.720 --> 45:04.440]  That's why we're doing this.
[45:04.440 --> 45:07.480]  If you're watching this and you don't listen to the podcast, crazy.
[45:07.980 --> 45:08.580]  Paul Goldschmidt.
[45:08.660 --> 45:09.680]  That's like Yoda, that's backwards.
[45:10.340 --> 45:10.660]  Lubob.
[45:11.240 --> 45:11.720]  Lubob!
[45:11.900 --> 45:12.340]  Not a leader.
[45:13.180 --> 45:14.080]  Tristan Kassas.
[45:14.320 --> 45:14.580]  Rookie.
[45:15.580 --> 45:16.060]  What?
[45:16.500 --> 45:16.520]  What?
[45:16.880 --> 45:17.660]  Corey Lee.
[45:18.120 --> 45:19.000]  Oh, that's a smile.
[45:20.020 --> 45:20.980]  Bayer Mayer.
[45:21.280 --> 45:24.040]  He's the Bruce Bolt founder and CEO.
[45:24.640 --> 45:25.920]  The fuck is Bruce Bolt?
[45:26.020 --> 45:26.600]  Bruce Bolt?
[45:26.880 --> 45:27.540]  What does it say?
[45:27.740 --> 45:29.600]  Give me grace or give me death.
[45:31.100 --> 45:32.160]  He was a teenager.
[45:32.340 --> 45:34.220]  He asked for gas money back in 2017.
[45:34.600 --> 45:35.080]  That's why he got a card.
[45:35.080 --> 45:36.920]  His father told him to start a company.
[45:37.440 --> 45:40.400]  He instructed his son to find a product that needed to be fixed.
[45:40.400 --> 45:43.760]  So he set out to make the most durable dating...
[45:43.760 --> 45:44.600]  batting gloves around.
[45:44.880 --> 45:45.360]  Dating gloves.
[45:45.560 --> 45:45.920]  What?
[45:46.440 --> 45:50.160]  The resulting product was Bruce Bolt batting gloves, named after his grandfather,
[45:50.500 --> 45:52.960]  who was twice survived being struck by lightning.
[45:53.320 --> 45:53.720]  That's cool.
[45:53.860 --> 45:57.340]  If it helps, I don't believe a fucking word in that story,
[45:57.420 --> 46:00.580]  other than his dad has a lot of money and that's how he got this.
[46:00.620 --> 46:02.060]  And he got tired of him asking for money.
[46:02.160 --> 46:03.720]  It was like he never gave him money.
[46:04.080 --> 46:05.140]  Mariano Rivera Mini.
[46:05.380 --> 46:05.860]  That's a cool one.
[46:06.800 --> 46:07.620]  Oh boy.
[46:07.940 --> 46:08.260]  A bite.
[46:08.860 --> 46:09.840]  Bobby Witt Jr.
[46:09.840 --> 46:11.120]  Second year card.
[46:11.320 --> 46:13.300]  And then we have a...
[46:13.300 --> 46:15.160]  We got a bird of prey.
[46:15.520 --> 46:16.480]  It's a harrier.
[46:17.300 --> 46:17.900]  It's a harrier.
[46:18.060 --> 46:18.760]  He's coming down.
[46:19.000 --> 46:19.940]  Is that like an owl?
[46:20.300 --> 46:22.940]  Oh no, he's another falcon type bird.
[46:23.260 --> 46:24.800]  Also known as the marsh hawk.
[46:26.340 --> 46:27.600]  He's a marsh hawk.
[46:27.700 --> 46:28.140]  That's pretty cool.
[46:28.160 --> 46:28.520]  Hell yeah.
[46:28.860 --> 46:30.980]  We saw a big bird by our house yesterday.
[46:32.960 --> 46:33.880]  It's a great story.
[46:34.580 --> 46:36.200]  It's like hanging out with my mom. That's awesome.
[46:36.360 --> 46:36.600]  Yeah.
[46:36.900 --> 46:37.740]  You saw a big...
[46:37.740 --> 46:38.860]  Is that a picture of a hawk?
[46:38.860 --> 46:39.920]  We saw a big bird.
[46:40.980 --> 46:42.920]  That's the thrill of our home.
[46:43.040 --> 46:44.440]  Wow, look at that.
[46:44.960 --> 46:45.840]  Emmanuel Clace.
[46:46.060 --> 46:46.500]  Oh, here we go.
[46:46.620 --> 46:48.480]  We got DJ Ski.
[46:51.540 --> 46:52.420]  Buster Posey.
[46:52.960 --> 46:54.300]  Ricky Henderson loves Ricky Henderson.
[46:55.420 --> 46:56.120]  We got a rookie.
[46:57.260 --> 46:59.120]  Kansas City Royals Nick Prado.
[46:59.380 --> 46:59.660]  Nice.
[46:59.840 --> 47:00.520]  That's a relic.
[47:00.780 --> 47:01.380]  That's very cool.
[47:01.600 --> 47:01.960]  His jersey.
[47:02.080 --> 47:02.760]  Just leave that please.
[47:03.500 --> 47:04.480]  Oh, this is a good parallel.
[47:04.680 --> 47:05.200]  We'll save that one.
[47:05.380 --> 47:06.620]  Dang, this is a piece of fabric.
[47:06.880 --> 47:07.380]  Here's Rich.
[47:08.040 --> 47:08.760]  Randy Johnson.
[47:09.000 --> 47:09.680]  Yeah, it's a piece of his jersey.
[47:11.540 --> 47:12.260]  And then...
[47:12.260 --> 47:15.740]  When you think of the United Kingdom and food, what do you think of?
[47:15.820 --> 47:16.620]  Bangers and mash.
[47:16.880 --> 47:17.540]  Beans, baby.
[47:18.280 --> 47:19.160]  You're both wrong.
[47:19.520 --> 47:20.300]  Fish and chips.
[47:20.380 --> 47:21.220]  Oh, that's a good one.
[47:21.300 --> 47:21.880]  Look at that.
[47:22.200 --> 47:22.980]  International delight.
[47:23.000 --> 47:24.600]  I feel like I haven't had fish and chips in a long time.
[47:24.740 --> 47:25.480]  I don't like them.
[47:25.520 --> 47:25.740]  Really?
[47:25.980 --> 47:26.500]  I like fish.
[47:26.740 --> 47:28.540]  I was going to say, do you not like the fish or the chips?
[47:28.700 --> 47:29.360]  I like chips fine.
[47:29.720 --> 47:32.200]  I wish they did like a chicken and chips.
[47:32.560 --> 47:33.820]  I think they probably do.
[47:34.200 --> 47:35.660]  I think if there's a place where you...
[47:35.660 --> 47:37.940]  What you want is just chicken tenders and French fries.
[47:38.120 --> 47:43.820]  But then when I remember when we were younger and we'd go to like Long John Silver's and I would just want French fries, they still taste like fish.
[47:44.020 --> 47:46.980]  Well, yeah, because you went to Long John Silver.
[47:46.980 --> 47:53.180]  Yeah, but do you think that like this place in England is going to have a different fry box for not fish?
[47:53.180 --> 47:55.340]  I meant like here, but yeah.
[47:56.860 --> 48:00.000]  Here's Brandon Marsh looking like a...
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.240]  Everything in this Long John Silver tastes like fish.
[48:03.200 --> 48:04.740]  Corbin Carroll-based rookie.
[48:04.920 --> 48:06.000]  There you go.
[48:06.160 --> 48:06.680]  Sleeve that.
[48:07.620 --> 48:09.440]  We got Miguel Vargas.
[48:09.660 --> 48:10.460]  Sleeve that.
[48:10.960 --> 48:12.240]  Oh, here we have...
[48:13.180 --> 48:14.080]  Oh, you're going to know this.
[48:14.880 --> 48:17.060]  Wrestler and Paralympic athlete.
[48:17.260 --> 48:18.280]  Who do you think that is?
[48:18.360 --> 48:19.100]  I have no idea.
[48:19.240 --> 48:19.940]  Zion Clark.
[48:20.620 --> 48:21.840]  Do you know him?
[48:22.500 --> 48:22.980]  No.
[48:23.500 --> 48:25.080]  Yeah, he's a wrestler and Paralympic athlete.
[48:25.560 --> 48:28.420]  Born without legs due to a rare condition called...
[48:28.420 --> 48:29.080]  Something.
[48:29.400 --> 48:30.520]  A legless wrestler?
[48:30.520 --> 48:32.140]  Caudal regression syndrome.
[48:32.340 --> 48:35.200]  He has fought through adversity his entire life.
[48:35.540 --> 48:37.060]  No excuses is his mantra.
[48:37.340 --> 48:40.600]  And he's achieved success as a wrestler, wheelchair racer, and an MMA fighter.
[48:40.720 --> 48:41.860]  I have. I've seen him wrestle.
[48:42.520 --> 48:44.320]  I've seen clips of him online.
[48:44.580 --> 48:45.460]  I've seen him wrestle.
[48:45.620 --> 48:47.260]  He's a Guinness World Record holder.
[48:47.520 --> 48:55.680]  And he hopes to be the first American to make the Summer Games wrestling and Paralympic wheelchair racing in separate sports.
[48:55.680 --> 49:00.820]  So, question. When you've seen him wrestle, does he have legs?
[49:00.880 --> 49:08.420]  No, I think we're mixing up what wrestling means here. I think this is more of a professional.
[49:08.620 --> 49:11.580]  Oh, I'm thinking of like WWE wrestling.
[49:11.640 --> 49:12.680]  No, Olympic wrestling.
[49:12.680 --> 49:13.900]  No, I think he's like Olympic wrestling.
[49:16.300 --> 49:18.420]  Kyle Stowers, Orioles rookie.
[49:19.240 --> 49:25.780]  We got Vinny Pascantino, rookie.
[49:26.100 --> 49:28.640]  And then parasailing in front of the sun.
[49:30.080 --> 49:30.520]  Great.
[49:31.040 --> 49:31.920]  Gotta love it.
[49:32.820 --> 49:35.000]  That's me all the way in the background in a sandbar.
[49:35.420 --> 49:36.580]  But I'm getting... I'm seven honors.
[49:36.700 --> 49:39.180]  But is it a sandbar or is it a grass yard?
[49:39.800 --> 49:40.360]  God damn it.
[49:40.660 --> 49:41.140]  But this also...
[49:41.140 --> 49:43.420]  Coming up in a future episode of Fuck Face.
[49:45.240 --> 49:48.060]  You're gonna hear all this bitch about a sandbar.
[49:48.060 --> 49:50.100]  It's the longest episode we've ever done.
[49:50.280 --> 49:50.600]  Yeah.
[49:50.720 --> 49:55.860]  It is by far... We have an episode in, I think, two weeks that is the longest episode of Fuck Face we've ever done.
[49:56.640 --> 49:57.420]  It's so long.
[49:57.700 --> 49:59.340]  Parasailing seems like it'd be so boring.
[49:59.420 --> 50:02.420]  Where you'd be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, and then you're like, okay, well...
[50:02.420 --> 50:06.420]  I think I would have a thrilling time because the whole time my wife would be going, ah, ah!
[50:07.660 --> 50:10.760]  And I would have to be holding her hand going, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
[50:11.800 --> 50:14.240]  All right, we're gonna crack open these Prism MBAs.
[50:14.240 --> 50:14.580]  Let's do it.
[50:14.580 --> 50:17.100]  And we'll head into mini helmets.
[50:17.100 --> 50:17.640]  I love it.
[50:17.680 --> 50:18.880]  Do you think the mini helmet will fit?
[50:18.980 --> 50:19.480]  Donna Mitchell.
[50:20.740 --> 50:20.960]  No.
[50:21.240 --> 50:21.440]  No.
[50:22.120 --> 50:23.860]  Harrison Barnes, Cracked Ice.
[50:24.220 --> 50:29.820]  Chris Middleton, Green Parallel, Green Prism.
[50:30.260 --> 50:31.760]  And the Admiral, David Robinson.
[50:31.960 --> 50:32.240]  Yeah!
[50:32.780 --> 50:33.500]  The man right there.
[50:33.640 --> 50:34.700]  What year is this, 2022?
[50:35.180 --> 50:35.440]  23?
[50:35.640 --> 50:36.500]  So this is last year?
[50:36.600 --> 50:37.900]  This is this year.
[50:38.040 --> 50:39.060]  This is the current...
[50:39.060 --> 50:40.200]  These are the current cards.
[50:40.900 --> 50:44.400]  I didn't know David Robinson, like, had, like, military duty that he...
[50:44.400 --> 50:45.260]  Like, that's the Admiral.
[50:45.620 --> 50:46.660]  Like, I didn't know that that was, like...
[50:46.660 --> 50:46.880]  For real?
[50:47.180 --> 50:47.520]  Oh, yeah.
[50:47.640 --> 50:48.340]  He cut his...
[50:48.340 --> 50:54.560]  His NBA career was short because he graduated from the Naval Academy, and so he didn't go
[50:54.560 --> 50:56.340]  into the NBA until he was, like, 22 or 23.
[50:56.540 --> 50:56.860]  Wow.
[50:57.120 --> 50:57.200]  Yeah.
[50:57.320 --> 50:58.480]  I didn't realize...
[50:58.480 --> 51:00.320]  I didn't know that until, like, a week ago.
[51:00.360 --> 51:00.980]  Makes him even cooler.
[51:01.060 --> 51:01.200]  Yeah.
[51:01.360 --> 51:01.780]  Even cooler.
[51:02.060 --> 51:02.760]  Hell of a guy.
[51:02.840 --> 51:03.440]  Hell of a role model.
[51:03.440 --> 51:04.280]  Thank you for your service.
[51:05.240 --> 51:08.920]  Georges Nyang, Alperen Sangoon, second-year card.
[51:09.240 --> 51:10.680]  LeBron James, Dominance.
[51:10.780 --> 51:11.600]  We'll go ahead and just leave that.
[51:12.220 --> 51:14.640]  Jabari Parker, base rookie.
[51:14.640 --> 51:16.480]  He's kind of a...
[51:16.480 --> 51:16.740]  I'm sorry.
[51:16.820 --> 51:17.500]  Jabari Smith.
[51:17.740 --> 51:18.200]  Jabari Parker.
[51:19.720 --> 51:22.900]  That's a good card, but it's a base rookie, so it's dogshit, like...
[51:22.900 --> 51:23.620]  When's the season start?
[51:24.240 --> 51:25.420]  Evan Mobley, next Tuesday.
[51:25.960 --> 51:26.620]  Wow, really?
[51:26.740 --> 51:27.140]  A week away?
[51:27.400 --> 51:28.320]  Yeah, we're...
[51:28.320 --> 51:29.420]  Eight days away.
[51:29.500 --> 51:30.040]  Josh Hart.
[51:30.980 --> 51:32.120]  Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[51:32.300 --> 51:32.340]  Hey!
[51:32.500 --> 51:33.000]  All right, here we go.
[51:33.080 --> 51:36.280]  Portland Trailblazers' newest center, Robert Williams.
[51:36.540 --> 51:36.980]  Yeah!
[51:37.800 --> 51:38.680]  Silver prism.
[51:38.940 --> 51:41.200]  Gonna stay healthy all year long!
[51:41.400 --> 51:43.540]  I have a lot of Robert Williams silver prisms.
[51:43.540 --> 51:44.360]  I pull him a lot.
[51:44.660 --> 51:47.420]  He usually has his knees are what bother him, huh?
[51:47.420 --> 51:47.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:47.860 --> 51:49.340]  He's had to have some knee surgery.
[51:50.040 --> 51:50.640]  Wilt Chamberlain.
[51:51.840 --> 51:52.240]  He's...
[51:52.240 --> 51:52.900]  As they do.
[51:52.960 --> 51:53.680]  If he could stay healthy...
[51:54.480 --> 51:54.880]  If!
[51:55.000 --> 51:55.500]  Just the best.
[51:55.720 --> 51:56.560]  Love him to death.
[51:56.860 --> 51:58.540]  So sad to lose him as a Celtic, but...
[51:59.160 --> 52:02.580]  He's never been healthy for more than 50 games in his career.
[52:02.680 --> 52:03.380]  Is he Time Lord?
[52:03.600 --> 52:04.160]  Time Lord, yeah.
[52:04.160 --> 52:04.480]  Time Lord.
[52:04.600 --> 52:05.020]  Time Lord.
[52:05.640 --> 52:06.440]  Buddy Heald.
[52:07.820 --> 52:08.960]  Allen Iverson, AI.
[52:09.420 --> 52:10.280]  That's a cool...
[52:10.280 --> 52:10.680]  Hell yeah.
[52:10.960 --> 52:11.620]  Cracked ice.
[52:12.180 --> 52:12.980]  Benedict Matherin.
[52:13.940 --> 52:14.340]  Green...
[52:15.820 --> 52:16.220]  Prism...
[52:16.220 --> 52:16.960]  Rookie.
[52:17.600 --> 52:18.000]  Miss.
[52:18.100 --> 52:18.960]  It's poorly cut.
[52:19.100 --> 52:19.480]  That's a shame.
[52:19.700 --> 52:19.900]  Bummer.
[52:20.580 --> 52:21.320]  Where is it?
[52:21.760 --> 52:22.560]  Oh yeah, that side?
[52:22.880 --> 52:24.780]  Yeah, it's a little light and it's...
[52:24.780 --> 52:25.800]  On the piss a bit.
[52:26.820 --> 52:28.020]  That'll keep it from being a 10.
[52:28.160 --> 52:29.840]  They're printed on one big sheet.
[52:30.040 --> 52:33.420]  So if this one is poorly cut, that means the whole sheet was fucked up, right?
[52:33.500 --> 52:33.660]  Yeah, probably.
[52:33.840 --> 52:33.980]  Okay.
[52:34.440 --> 52:34.800]  It sucks.
[52:35.160 --> 52:35.640]  Do you want me to say it?
[52:35.760 --> 52:36.220]  Yeah, please.
[52:38.200 --> 52:39.000]  Jaden McDaniels.
[52:39.680 --> 52:40.480]  DeAndre Ayton.
[52:40.480 --> 52:42.460]  I want more Allen Iverson cards.
[52:42.580 --> 52:43.480]  Jalen Williams.
[52:43.620 --> 52:44.120]  Instant Impact.
[52:44.560 --> 52:45.280]  And Doug McDermott.
[52:45.380 --> 52:45.920]  Dougie Buckets.
[52:46.160 --> 52:48.060]  You know, we ran into AI in Vegas.
[52:48.300 --> 52:48.540]  Really?
[52:48.920 --> 52:49.280]  January.
[52:49.960 --> 52:50.580]  We walked by him.
[52:50.640 --> 52:51.140]  Walked right by him.
[52:51.200 --> 52:51.760]  How tall was he?
[52:52.340 --> 52:53.160]  It's my height.
[52:53.300 --> 52:53.820]  Like six foot tall.
[52:54.040 --> 52:58.200]  I think he's supposed to be 6'6 or 6'1 maybe, but he's under that.
[52:58.360 --> 52:59.220]  I didn't notice that.
[52:59.280 --> 53:02.020]  Usually if we see people, I'm like, is that an NBA player or something?
[53:02.240 --> 53:03.100]  No, he's like...
[53:03.100 --> 53:04.280]  That was his thing.
[53:04.360 --> 53:07.260]  He was just that good that it didn't matter that he was six foot.
[53:07.360 --> 53:07.900]  He wasn't that good.
[53:08.220 --> 53:09.040]  Mini Helmet.
[53:09.220 --> 53:10.100]  Let's open this motherfucker up.
[53:10.160 --> 53:10.940]  Let's see what's going on.
[53:11.400 --> 53:12.620]  We've never opened this before.
[53:12.860 --> 53:16.920]  We haven't opened any of these before, so we don't know what exactly we're about to get into.
[53:17.120 --> 53:20.100]  Last time we opened one of these hit parades, it turned out to be a Shaq auto.
[53:20.140 --> 53:21.400]  Yeah, what's the team?
[53:21.600 --> 53:23.200]  Okay, let's just say it's MLB teams.
[53:23.340 --> 53:24.100]  Okay, MLB teams.
[53:24.280 --> 53:25.600]  What's the team you don't want?
[53:27.320 --> 53:29.540]  I heard you talking shit on the Diamondbacks earlier.
[53:29.600 --> 53:29.780]  Yeah.
[53:29.780 --> 53:30.540]  Maybe not that.
[53:30.660 --> 53:30.820]  Okay.
[53:31.060 --> 53:33.800]  I mean, they're in the NLCS, so they're very good, but...
[53:33.800 --> 53:35.480]  I do not want an Astros.
[53:36.460 --> 53:37.360]  Kansas City Royals.
[53:37.720 --> 53:38.080]  Oh.
[53:38.800 --> 53:40.300]  They do nothing for me.
[53:40.560 --> 53:43.600]  Give me a team that I hate over a team that just does nothing for me.
[53:43.620 --> 53:44.380]  Oh, you know who I don't like?
[53:44.460 --> 53:45.140]  The Twins.
[53:45.280 --> 53:45.660]  There you go.
[53:46.840 --> 53:46.880]  Yeah!
[53:47.060 --> 53:48.100]  Take that, Gracie!
[53:48.200 --> 53:48.500]  Yeah!
[53:51.400 --> 53:55.240]  Although, I don't know why I carry, like, white socks grudges.
[53:55.480 --> 53:56.840]  They're so fucking bad.
[53:56.920 --> 53:57.040]  Yeah.
[53:57.700 --> 54:00.260]  I really should just knuckle down and become a Tigers fan.
[54:00.900 --> 54:01.260]  Yay!
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.240]  They're just as bad, but at least I can go to the games.
[54:04.280 --> 54:05.460]  Well, and they have a cute logo.
[54:05.660 --> 54:06.720]  Everything has a logo.
[54:06.720 --> 54:08.820]  I like when they go, like, insane mode Tiger.
[54:08.920 --> 54:09.320]  All right, here we go.
[54:12.240 --> 54:12.520]  And...
[54:12.520 --> 54:13.360]  I'm gonna look at the box.
[54:13.500 --> 54:14.060]  We're gonna give you the box.
[54:14.440 --> 54:15.320]  It's not in the box.
[54:15.660 --> 54:16.280]  Oh, my God.
[54:16.300 --> 54:16.960]  Maybe it's in the bag.
[54:18.840 --> 54:19.940]  Okay, here we go.
[54:20.120 --> 54:21.500]  I thought this thing would be, like, heavy and metal.
[54:21.700 --> 54:21.880]  Uh-huh.
[54:21.960 --> 54:22.480]  I don't think it is.
[54:22.500 --> 54:23.100]  No, it's a little plastic one.
[54:23.100 --> 54:24.180]  Is it, like, what they serve ice cream in?
[54:24.180 --> 54:24.980]  All right, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[54:25.560 --> 54:26.940]  Is this more stuff with nachos in it?
[54:26.960 --> 54:27.240]  Yeah.
[54:28.060 --> 54:28.720]  No, it's bigger than that.
[54:28.800 --> 54:29.460]  Oh, God damn it!
[54:29.920 --> 54:31.120]  I really want to!
[54:31.960 --> 54:32.680]  What is it?
[54:32.700 --> 54:33.760]  The one team I didn't want.
[54:34.260 --> 54:34.540]  Ew!
[54:36.060 --> 54:38.320]  It is Drew Gilbert Mini Helmet.
[54:38.940 --> 54:39.420]  Wow!
[54:40.220 --> 54:41.520]  What is Drew Gilbert?
[54:41.660 --> 54:42.500]  Do you know anything about him?
[54:42.680 --> 54:43.000]  No.
[54:43.000 --> 54:43.760]  No, let's look him up.
[54:43.980 --> 54:44.800]  Yeah, let's see.
[54:44.800 --> 54:46.140]  I don't know who the fuck Drew Gilbert is.
[54:46.560 --> 54:47.420]  Uh, let's see.
[54:47.520 --> 54:50.340]  Fun facts about Drew Gil... Gilbert.
[54:50.780 --> 54:51.900]  Wow, what a...
[54:51.900 --> 54:52.140]  Okay.
[54:52.240 --> 54:52.640]  All right.
[54:53.340 --> 54:53.720]  Hey!
[54:54.000 --> 54:55.580]  He, uh...
[54:55.580 --> 54:56.220]  He was...
[54:56.220 --> 54:57.480]  He's a baseball outfielder
[54:57.480 --> 54:59.020]  in the New York Mets organization.
[55:00.500 --> 55:02.560]  Uh, he played college baseball
[55:02.560 --> 55:03.960]  for the Tennessee Volunteers.
[55:03.960 --> 55:04.500]  He did.
[55:04.700 --> 55:05.200]  Well, yeah.
[55:05.460 --> 55:06.480]  He's 23.
[55:07.200 --> 55:08.080]  Oh, good for him.
[55:09.340 --> 55:09.740]  Uh...
[55:09.740 --> 55:12.440]  Houston Astros round one overall pick, 28.
[55:13.820 --> 55:15.340]  He's the 28th pick in the...
[55:15.340 --> 55:15.960]  In the first round.
[55:15.960 --> 55:16.640]  In the first round, yeah.
[55:16.780 --> 55:17.160]  That's pretty good.
[55:17.420 --> 55:17.880]  Yeah, sure.
[55:18.080 --> 55:20.700]  Uh, you can follow him on Twitter, or X,
[55:21.120 --> 55:22.660]  at Gilly Goober.
[55:23.180 --> 55:24.020]  That's up to you.
[55:24.920 --> 55:25.720]  Gilly Goober.
[55:27.420 --> 55:28.900]  You can't pick any name.
[55:28.900 --> 55:29.740]  Let's crack this...
[55:29.740 --> 55:30.940]  Let's crack this Alan again
[55:30.940 --> 55:32.500]  and just see if we get a rip card.
[55:33.180 --> 55:34.240]  Because we got about five minutes.
[55:34.420 --> 55:35.460]  So, we're just gonna go out
[55:35.460 --> 55:36.520]  opening out A and G.
[55:37.440 --> 55:39.300]  Uh, this is not gonna be a rip card.
[55:39.380 --> 55:39.580]  What?
[55:39.720 --> 55:40.560]  I don't think.
[55:40.680 --> 55:41.040]  Come on.
[55:41.800 --> 55:42.480]  I don't...
[55:42.480 --> 55:43.220]  But, like, he...
[55:43.220 --> 55:43.400]  Oh.
[55:44.320 --> 55:44.880]  What do we got?
[55:44.940 --> 55:46.780]  He didn't really play for the Astros much.
[55:46.820 --> 55:47.340]  He's a...
[55:47.340 --> 55:47.940]  He's a draft pick.
[55:48.060 --> 55:48.920]  Vladimir Guerrero.
[55:49.200 --> 55:50.160]  Is that a rip one?
[55:50.280 --> 55:50.560]  No.
[55:51.160 --> 55:52.080]  No, it's not.
[55:52.140 --> 55:52.720]  He's just tall.
[55:53.080 --> 55:53.520]  It's just...
[55:53.520 --> 55:54.980]  Dude, he's just...
[55:54.980 --> 55:56.100]  Oh, man.
[55:56.320 --> 55:56.920]  You got a tall sleeve.
[55:57.300 --> 55:57.600]  Yeah.
[55:58.400 --> 55:58.780]  That's fun.
[55:59.680 --> 56:01.140]  It says congratulations on the back.
[56:01.660 --> 56:02.460]  You know, maybe...
[56:02.460 --> 56:03.820]  As if it's...
[56:03.820 --> 56:04.420]  Did you beat the pack sack?
[56:06.080 --> 56:06.520]  Yes.
[56:07.040 --> 56:07.680]  Yes, I did.
[56:07.920 --> 56:08.600]  We got five minutes.
[56:08.840 --> 56:09.860]  We're just gonna open these up.
[56:10.040 --> 56:10.780]  We're just gonna open up
[56:10.780 --> 56:11.320]  out and get...
[56:11.320 --> 56:11.560]  We're gonna...
[56:12.040 --> 56:12.960]  We're gonna shut it down.
[56:13.080 --> 56:13.760]  We're gonna kick us off.
[56:14.420 --> 56:15.420]  Uh, Tim Hudson.
[56:15.980 --> 56:16.100]  Yeah.
[56:16.240 --> 56:16.920]  Here we go.
[56:18.080 --> 56:18.520]  Olivia...
[56:18.520 --> 56:19.140]  Rodrigo.
[56:19.400 --> 56:19.840]  Pichardo.
[56:20.300 --> 56:21.080]  College baseball player.
[56:21.380 --> 56:21.460]  Yeah.
[56:21.860 --> 56:23.460]  Here we have, uh,
[56:23.540 --> 56:24.960]  Denard Shoelace Robinson.
[56:25.140 --> 56:25.860]  He's a playmaker.
[56:26.120 --> 56:26.560]  Nice.
[56:26.620 --> 56:26.900]  Apparently.
[56:27.500 --> 56:28.200]  Stan Musial.
[56:28.600 --> 56:28.840]  Okay.
[56:29.180 --> 56:30.020]  Reid Detmers.
[56:30.460 --> 56:30.840]  All right.
[56:30.840 --> 56:31.920]  Looks like Ted Williams.
[56:32.060 --> 56:32.380]  Okay.
[56:32.640 --> 56:33.180]  He's old-timey.
[56:33.520 --> 56:34.980]  There's a lot of old-timey players out there.
[56:35.100 --> 56:35.880]  Edgar Martinez.
[56:36.240 --> 56:37.240]  Speaking of old-timey, there you go.
[56:37.800 --> 56:38.840]  And, uh, Bob Gibson.
[56:39.120 --> 56:39.400]  All right.
[56:39.420 --> 56:39.820]  All right.
[56:40.400 --> 56:41.160]  Bob Gibson.
[56:41.340 --> 56:42.000]  He ain't playin'.
[56:42.000 --> 56:42.620]  Old-timey.
[56:42.620 --> 56:43.560]  He ain't playin'.
[56:45.360 --> 56:46.020]  Hey, let's all...
[56:46.020 --> 56:48.160]  Way back in 93!
[56:50.460 --> 56:51.340]  Raphael Devers.
[56:51.780 --> 56:53.120]  Uh, Freddie Freeman.
[56:53.360 --> 56:54.700]  Where the fuck were you in the playoffs?
[56:55.160 --> 56:55.200]  Boo!
[56:55.680 --> 56:56.100]  Boo!
[56:57.340 --> 56:58.220]  Nolan Jones.
[56:58.300 --> 56:59.600]  Back to the Braves.
[57:00.500 --> 57:01.300]  Max Mayer.
[57:01.660 --> 57:02.020]  Oh!
[57:03.460 --> 57:04.680]  Comedian Kevin Hart.
[57:04.880 --> 57:05.280]  Hey!
[57:06.180 --> 57:07.120]  If I'm gonna slave...
[57:07.900 --> 57:08.300]  slave...
[57:08.300 --> 57:09.540]  If I'm gonna sleeve that...
[57:09.540 --> 57:10.600]  He's friends with The Rock.
[57:10.860 --> 57:12.100]  So, uh...
[57:12.100 --> 57:12.740]  BFFs.
[57:12.880 --> 57:13.980]  So, yeah, they are BFFs.
[57:14.000 --> 57:14.640]  So that we can...
[57:14.640 --> 57:17.000]  Because I'm sure that we'll probably have some, like, funny comedian teams and stuff.
[57:17.120 --> 57:17.500]  Oh, yeah.
[57:17.680 --> 57:18.340]  We're a common thread.
[57:18.880 --> 57:20.100]  Uh, George Springer.
[57:21.460 --> 57:21.860]  Oh!
[57:22.240 --> 57:23.240]  Gummy Bears.
[57:23.520 --> 57:23.920]  Yeah!
[57:24.040 --> 57:24.460]  There we go.
[57:24.500 --> 57:25.300]  Dessert card.
[57:25.600 --> 57:27.320]  And then Snorkeling.
[57:27.820 --> 57:28.140]  Oh!
[57:28.780 --> 57:29.960]  You did that?
[57:30.140 --> 57:30.600]  I did that.
[57:30.640 --> 57:31.800]  We did snorkel!
[57:32.140 --> 57:32.340]  Uh-huh.
[57:32.400 --> 57:33.260]  I had a noodle.
[57:33.640 --> 57:33.980]  Emily did.
[57:34.920 --> 57:36.120]  And I had a...
[57:36.120 --> 57:37.280]  I didn't even have a snorkel gear.
[57:37.320 --> 57:40.180]  I had, like, a cup that I could look into the water with.
[57:40.240 --> 57:42.380]  And you'll learn all about that.
[57:42.580 --> 57:42.800]  Uh-huh.
[57:42.800 --> 57:44.200]  We had some good...
[57:44.200 --> 57:46.480]  Uh, good luck with that discount pack...
[57:46.680 --> 57:49.280]  So I got another box of discount cards that we're gonna go out on.
[57:49.640 --> 57:51.940]  Uh, it is the Art of Collecting 2022.
[57:52.040 --> 57:52.640]  Topps Gallery.
[57:52.780 --> 57:53.680]  They don't make these anymore.
[57:53.860 --> 57:55.120]  I think this was the last year they made them.
[57:55.340 --> 57:57.060]  I think they're some of the nicest fucking cards, though.
[57:57.540 --> 57:58.600]  I really like them.
[57:58.640 --> 57:59.840]  So we'll, uh...
[57:59.840 --> 58:01.120]  I'm excited for the coming weeks.
[58:01.220 --> 58:01.760]  The hit parade.
[58:02.020 --> 58:02.560]  Is this a football?
[58:02.800 --> 58:03.380]  And then the...
[58:03.380 --> 58:03.940]  And then a bat.
[58:04.060 --> 58:04.280]  Yeah.
[58:04.480 --> 58:06.620]  I bet we'll get way better stuff on...
[58:06.620 --> 58:07.840]  Football and a bat.
[58:08.120 --> 58:11.120]  I don't think they're gonna have some schmuck sign a bat.
[58:11.620 --> 58:13.400]  You would be surprised.
[58:13.560 --> 58:14.000]  I'm ex...
[58:14.000 --> 58:14.980]  I look forward to it.
[58:15.280 --> 58:15.560]  Here we go!
[58:15.580 --> 58:15.880]  Here we go.
[58:15.940 --> 58:16.460]  Babe Ruth.
[58:16.760 --> 58:17.200]  Oh!
[58:17.320 --> 58:17.600]  Hey!
[58:17.920 --> 58:18.780]  He needs to sign the bat.
[58:19.620 --> 58:20.060]  Oh!
[58:20.720 --> 58:22.780]  Here's a printer's proof of Austin Meadows.
[58:23.020 --> 58:23.460]  That's cool.
[58:24.860 --> 58:27.600]  Brian Reynolds and O'Neal Cruz rookie.
[58:27.900 --> 58:28.500]  O'Neal Cruz is pretty good.
[58:28.820 --> 58:29.480]  He's very tall.
[58:29.760 --> 58:30.620]  He is very tall.
[58:30.800 --> 58:31.480]  He's very tall.
[58:31.600 --> 58:33.380]  Especially for the shortstop position.
[58:33.540 --> 58:34.640]  O'Neal Cruz is tall?
[58:35.060 --> 58:35.280]  Yeah.
[58:35.840 --> 58:36.540]  Tall stop.
[58:36.640 --> 58:37.020]  There you go.
[58:38.140 --> 58:39.020]  Roy Campanella.
[58:39.420 --> 58:39.540]  Yeah.
[58:39.960 --> 58:41.000]  Patrick Wisdom.
[58:41.180 --> 58:42.000]  He's taller than Alan Iverson.
[58:42.020 --> 58:42.420]  He's smart.
[58:42.500 --> 58:43.340]  Probably should save that.
[58:43.520 --> 58:44.160]  His name's a thing.
[58:44.660 --> 58:46.580]  Corey Seeger, print proof.
[58:47.180 --> 58:48.080]  What are print proofs?
[58:48.100 --> 58:50.780]  Andrew Benintendi, Alfonso Rivas.
[58:50.780 --> 58:53.300]  They're just like a different parallel you can get.
[58:54.160 --> 58:57.880]  I don't think that they're real anymore, but they used to do like printers would do like
[58:57.880 --> 58:58.660]  a proof set.
[58:59.140 --> 59:00.960]  And I think they just kind of made their way into...
[59:00.960 --> 59:01.260]  Interesting.
[59:01.840 --> 59:03.860]  Would you say we've had any good hits today?
[59:05.120 --> 59:06.120]  Yeah, we had that autograph.
[59:06.660 --> 59:06.920]  Yeah?
[59:07.100 --> 59:07.600]  We had an autograph.
[59:08.820 --> 59:09.960]  I mean, last week was pretty big.
[59:10.060 --> 59:12.260]  Maybe there's like a curse amongst us or something.
[59:12.480 --> 59:13.820]  It probably evens out over time.
[59:13.920 --> 59:14.320]  A curse?
[59:14.660 --> 59:15.820]  Fernando Tatis Jr.
[59:16.020 --> 59:16.260]  Yeah!
[59:17.880 --> 59:19.120]  Patrick Wisdom again.
[59:20.380 --> 59:21.060]  There we go.
[59:21.980 --> 59:22.700]  Josh Donaldson.
[59:22.900 --> 59:24.620]  And then there's a TORC rookie.
[59:25.040 --> 59:26.020]  I like that name.
[59:26.040 --> 59:26.220]  Spencer Torkelson.
[59:27.280 --> 59:30.320]  I have a friend whose last name is Torkelson and we call him TORC.
[59:30.500 --> 59:30.660]  Do you?
[59:30.860 --> 59:34.240]  There was a show on the Disney Channel called the Torkelsons that I watched that I liked.
[59:34.400 --> 59:34.820]  That's fun.
[59:35.380 --> 59:36.060]  Was he in it?
[59:36.240 --> 59:36.840]  Yeah, I think so.
[59:36.900 --> 59:37.600]  I think he was a little kid.
[59:37.720 --> 59:38.260]  Joe Adel.
[59:38.700 --> 59:39.220]  Kyle Tucker.
[59:39.320 --> 59:41.180]  Crazy that he ended up being a major league baseball player.
[59:41.260 --> 59:41.420]  Yeah.
[59:42.600 --> 59:44.660]  Roanze Contreras, print proof.
[59:45.540 --> 59:46.700]  Fernando Tatis Jr.
[59:46.900 --> 59:47.260]  Nice!
[59:47.860 --> 59:48.600]  That's really cool.
[59:48.600 --> 59:49.280]  That's a cool card.
[59:49.720 --> 59:50.920]  He's still doing steroids?
[59:51.940 --> 59:53.000]  Yeah, but, you know, secret.
[59:53.240 --> 59:53.460]  Steven Kwan.
[59:53.460 --> 59:54.240]  Was it for his worms?
[59:54.660 --> 59:55.800]  Yeah, he's dewormed.
[59:55.820 --> 59:56.960]  Oh, he's the one with the worms.
[59:57.140 --> 59:57.700]  Well, not anymore.
[59:57.920 --> 59:58.620]  He had worms.
[59:58.720 --> 59:58.960]  Right.
[59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.460]  Like, you know, like when a dog gets worms.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:00.800]  Yeah.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.440]  You gotta take the steroids to kill the worms.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:02.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.740]  Well, it's dog, you know.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:04.460]  Oh, shit!
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.880]  That's a nice J-Rod rookie.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:06.340]  Nice.
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.040]  We'll sleeve that.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.420]  That's probably worth a little bit.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.180]  Jacob DeGrom.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.620]  Here we have a silver Alec Manda.
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:13.860]  I don't know who that is.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.020]  Mike Piazza.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.000]  Pizza.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.080]  Might have been the first case of frosted tips in the MLB.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.800]  He was real big, I remember.
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:22.320]  Was he steroids, too?
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.300]  He almost fucking...
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:23.540]  Yeah.
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:24.720]  He almost died.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.140]  Really?
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:25.780]  Because of the steroids?
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.920]  No, because he got hit in the face with a pin.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.660]  He was always a guy that...
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:30.840]  Like, it was like the 90s, and it's like,
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.020]  oh, my God, isn't this guy so handsome?
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:33.060]  And it's like, what?
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:34.660]  And then he got blasted in the face.
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:35.240]  Yeah, there's you.
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:35.800]  There you go.
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:36.720]  Oh, here we go.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:37.400]  Griffey Jr.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:37.920]  Nice.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:38.440]  Nice.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.060]  And then we'll go out on Anthony Rizzo.
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:41.400]  Yeah!
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.520]  Re-signed with the Yankees, and that didn't, I mean,
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.840]  didn't really work out for them, so, you know.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.040]  New York has bad luck with teams, huh?
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.720]  Yeah, all those championships.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.480]  But I feel like lately, like,
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.820]  the Nets kind of did all this stuff
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:55.720]  where they should have been good.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.600]  The Nets are terrible.
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:57.260]  Yeah, but that's fun.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:57.780]  The Knicks are terrible.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:58.320]  There's a lot of things like,
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.420]  they should be good.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.020]  The Mets are terrible.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:01.960]  Yeah, that's fun to watch.
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.160]  The Yankees are currently not great.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:05.460]  Yeah.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:06.960]  But have a billion championships.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.420]  No, I'm saying like, currently.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:09.380]  Currently.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:10.180]  Currently.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:10.860]  All right.
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:11.440]  Hey, we did it!
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.300]  Well, you can listen to the podcast.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.500]  We have a bunch of stuff coming out.
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.520]  Hey, did you catch the Blank Side that came out?
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:18.760]  We have that recently.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.400]  That's fun.
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:21.700]  But that's the end of this episode
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:22.580]  of The Break Show.
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:23.880]  We have stuff coming out.
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:24.940]  Oh, the Sloppy Joe's Bingo set.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  Don't forget about Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:26.600]  Still available.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.020]  It's the most fun you can have having fun.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.020]  Next week, are we doing the bat or the football?
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.800]  Next week, we're gonna do the bat.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:33.320]  Yeah!
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.300]  Baseball season, baby.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.320]  Okay, we have a hard out of 5.02,
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.960]  so enjoy probably Funhaus.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:39.480]  I don't know.
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:40.640]  I mean, I would think.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.040]  Enjoy.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:41.640]  Yeah.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:42.960]  Take that.
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.800]  Yeah, take that, Funhaus!
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.640]  Yeah!
