[00:13.620 --> 00:16.860]  Hello and welcome to the F*** Face Break Show.
[00:17.460 --> 00:19.780]  We missed you last week. We weren't here.
[00:19.880 --> 00:22.040]  But we're back this week. We got our Dallas poster.
[00:22.680 --> 00:25.320]  Better than ever. Full crew. Everybody's excited.
[00:25.780 --> 00:29.420]  And boy do we have... we have so much goddamn stuff to get to today.
[00:29.900 --> 00:30.300]  Demonetized.
[00:30.420 --> 00:33.540]  There's no way. There's gosh damn stuff.
[00:33.840 --> 00:36.780]  There's no way we're going to be able to get to it all.
[00:36.880 --> 00:39.720]  But I do want to show it all off. It's so much happening today.
[00:39.880 --> 00:40.140]  Let's see!
[00:40.140 --> 00:42.920]  The very first thing that we always do when we...
[00:42.920 --> 00:45.960]  Oh, you know what I want to do? I want to tease what we're going to open at the end.
[00:46.020 --> 00:48.400]  Oh, okay. I'm Eric. This is Emily. This is Geoff.
[00:48.420 --> 00:52.240]  And we have a tease for you for the very end of this show.
[00:52.380 --> 00:54.980]  Our names aren't important. What's important is this stuff, right?
[00:55.360 --> 00:59.160]  I think this episode we're going to open up this hefty hit parade.
[01:00.340 --> 01:02.200]  Autographed basketball. We don't know what it is.
[01:02.500 --> 01:03.680]  Well, we know what it is. It's basketball.
[01:03.740 --> 01:05.480]  Yeah, we know what it is. Gracie didn't know what it was.
[01:05.600 --> 01:06.760]  But we know what it is.
[01:06.840 --> 01:07.680]  But we don't know what's in it.
[01:07.780 --> 01:08.440]  What could it be?
[01:08.440 --> 01:11.960]  It could be Luka Doncic. It could be Kevin Durant. Who knows?
[01:12.560 --> 01:16.120]  It could be Davis Bertrands. I don't know.
[01:16.180 --> 01:16.980]  Could it be Marcus Mart?
[01:17.040 --> 01:19.760]  It could be Elford Payton. It could be Marcus Mart, maybe.
[01:19.780 --> 01:21.160]  It could be Elford Payton.
[01:21.500 --> 01:23.480]  We also have... There's so much cool stuff I bought.
[01:23.700 --> 01:28.180]  Look at this. Disney 100. This is like some weird... I think this is from Japan.
[01:28.780 --> 01:30.580]  I can't wait to crack into these bad boys.
[01:31.120 --> 01:33.100]  I want to talk about this in a little bit. Tops Chrome.
[01:33.420 --> 01:33.540]  Okay.
[01:33.920 --> 01:35.480]  I'm really excited about this one.
[01:36.320 --> 01:39.240]  2021 Pieces of the Past, historical edition.
[01:39.480 --> 01:43.700]  We could get something from JFK or Babe Ruth or Abraham Lincoln.
[01:44.020 --> 01:45.640]  What could you get from JFK?
[01:45.720 --> 01:50.000]  Or MLK. Probably not like... It's not like Viscera, if that's what you're wondering.
[01:50.140 --> 01:53.760]  I'm thinking probably just like a lapel from a jacket or something.
[01:53.820 --> 01:54.080]  Oh, okay.
[01:54.440 --> 01:57.980]  Then some more Mickey Mouse hotbox. I went nuts.
[01:58.300 --> 02:00.800]  Got some Star Wars galaxy...
[02:00.800 --> 02:01.380]  Mickey Mouse hotbox?
[02:01.480 --> 02:01.740]  Yeah.
[02:02.240 --> 02:04.240]  Mickey Mouse smokes you out in his car.
[02:04.240 --> 02:05.560]  Yeah, he hotboxes you.
[02:05.660 --> 02:07.320]  You ever been to Honda Accord with Mickey Mouse?
[02:09.940 --> 02:11.220]  Goofy's handing me whippets.
[02:11.480 --> 02:17.380]  And then after the rip card debacle, I went all in on Alan and Ginter.
[02:17.820 --> 02:17.980]  Wow!
[02:18.080 --> 02:21.160]  So these are all opportunities for us to get rip cards.
[02:21.700 --> 02:24.600]  Why would you call it a debacle? I think it was a great learning experience.
[02:24.920 --> 02:27.520]  Man, Emily and I have been watching rip card videos on YouTube.
[02:27.660 --> 02:30.960]  We watched a dude open $1,400 worth of rip cards.
[02:30.960 --> 02:35.180]  He got one hit, and that one hit was a TikTok comedian.
[02:35.560 --> 02:35.980]  No!
[02:36.040 --> 02:37.660]  An autograph of a TikTok comedian.
[02:37.980 --> 02:39.960]  It was one of the sadder things I've seen.
[02:40.080 --> 02:40.300]  Yeah.
[02:40.800 --> 02:41.820]  It was pretty brutal.
[02:42.160 --> 02:47.200]  But the very first thing we like to do is show off the hits from the last episode...
[02:47.200 --> 02:48.760]  ...and then talk about what they're worth.
[02:48.820 --> 02:49.280]  That's cool.
[02:49.360 --> 02:50.700]  I want to do that with you guys.
[02:51.220 --> 02:53.360]  So remember, these are all...
[02:53.360 --> 02:55.180]  I based these off of eBay sold auctions.
[02:55.440 --> 02:57.640]  This is from last time, so not last week.
[02:57.660 --> 02:58.020]  Two weeks ago.
[02:58.120 --> 02:59.800]  Yeah, two weeks ago. You go back and watch it.
[02:59.800 --> 03:05.280]  Probably the biggest hit we got was this Scottie Pippen Jr. rookie scripts auto.
[03:05.680 --> 03:07.980]  And that little fucker is not on my...
[03:08.700 --> 03:09.420]  Here we go, card values.
[03:09.760 --> 03:10.800]  Scottie Pippen Jr., that's about $20.
[03:11.280 --> 03:12.920]  Scottie Pippen Jr., this little fucker.
[03:13.100 --> 03:15.720]  Then we got these Alex and Ginner minis.
[03:15.900 --> 03:16.300]  Oh, nice.
[03:16.420 --> 03:22.360]  We got the high cheese, we got Whitey Herzog, and then Rocky Mountain National Park.
[03:22.460 --> 03:23.340]  Any fucking sense.
[03:23.580 --> 03:24.860]  Those are going for about $2 each.
[03:25.060 --> 03:25.980]  We got cheese and rocks.
[03:26.340 --> 03:28.060]  Then we got Italian sub.
[03:28.280 --> 03:28.460]  Yeah.
[03:29.080 --> 03:29.920]  Get that bread.
[03:30.120 --> 03:32.260]  Yeah, get that bread, get that bread.
[03:32.540 --> 03:33.600]  Get that bread, $1.
[03:33.960 --> 03:36.400]  By the way, you know what's supposedly in Alan and Ginner 2023?
[03:36.680 --> 03:36.880]  What's that?
[03:37.140 --> 03:39.300]  I told you guys earlier, there's Falcons in it.
[03:39.340 --> 03:40.220]  And there is a Falcon card.
[03:40.600 --> 03:43.240]  I just found out there's a Jet Ski card in there.
[03:43.440 --> 03:43.800]  Really?
[03:44.120 --> 03:44.300]  Yeah.
[03:44.360 --> 03:44.960]  Oh, wow.
[03:45.140 --> 03:47.160]  So if we get a Jet Ski card, we're definitely sending it off.
[03:47.300 --> 03:47.720]  I need it.
[03:47.780 --> 03:48.680]  To get it graded.
[03:48.920 --> 03:51.220]  Have we talked about the Falcon line that we're doing?
[03:52.100 --> 03:53.440]  I think we have.
[03:53.480 --> 03:53.740]  Okay.
[03:54.180 --> 03:54.880]  Maybe not.
[03:55.380 --> 03:56.120]  We got Falcons.
[03:56.260 --> 03:58.360]  We got Falcon stuff in the works.
[03:58.360 --> 03:59.280]  We got a lot of stuff in the works.
[03:59.280 --> 04:00.400]  We got Falcon stuff in the works.
[04:00.580 --> 04:02.780]  I got something that I was going to show off today that Eric doesn't want me to.
[04:02.880 --> 04:03.840]  So maybe we'll fight about it later.
[04:04.080 --> 04:04.260]  Great.
[04:04.420 --> 04:05.620]  This Von Grissom.
[04:05.780 --> 04:06.320]  I don't want you to.
[04:07.320 --> 04:10.140]  This Von Grissom rookie, Bowman Chrome.
[04:10.540 --> 04:11.760]  That's a $2.
[04:11.840 --> 04:12.760]  You're not going to retire from it.
[04:12.780 --> 04:13.060]  That's $2.
[04:13.900 --> 04:17.960]  But you're going to do better than if you got this Martin Gonzales Bowman first paper card.
[04:18.020 --> 04:20.560]  That's going to run you... that's about a dollar.
[04:21.240 --> 04:21.880]  A dollar?
[04:22.120 --> 04:23.820]  Then we have this Carlos Jorge.
[04:24.120 --> 04:25.540]  This is a number to 150.
[04:26.140 --> 04:27.340]  Bowman Chrome first.
[04:27.900 --> 04:30.200]  That is going to run you $20.
[04:30.720 --> 04:32.220]  That's about right there with the Scotty Pippen.
[04:32.300 --> 04:33.500]  What's the people rolling around on the ground for?
[04:33.540 --> 04:34.800]  Mike's just rolling around on the ground.
[04:35.280 --> 04:36.860]  Mike heard this episode of Anima.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  He said, you didn't talk enough about old restaurants.
[04:39.280 --> 04:40.520]  And he started rolling around on the ground.
[04:40.980 --> 04:44.940]  Then DayVision.
[04:45.420 --> 04:46.360]  That's a cool name.
[04:46.360 --> 04:47.180]  De Los Santos.
[04:47.860 --> 04:48.860]  Bowman first Chrome.
[04:49.020 --> 04:49.540]  Just to give you an idea.
[04:49.660 --> 04:50.360]  Average player.
[04:50.500 --> 04:51.040]  That's a dollar.
[04:51.740 --> 04:52.400]  Here you go.
[04:52.500 --> 04:54.160]  This is a numbered perfect parallel.
[04:54.480 --> 04:55.220]  That's a dollar.
[04:55.220 --> 04:58.620]  And then this Andrew Painter rookie is $2.
[04:59.320 --> 05:00.060]  There you go.
[05:00.100 --> 05:01.660]  Not a whole hell of a lot there.
[05:02.700 --> 05:03.680]  Those are the hits.
[05:03.840 --> 05:04.380]  Those are the hits.
[05:04.520 --> 05:07.360]  Now we're going to open something up from the pack sack.
[05:07.740 --> 05:09.100]  Got to go with the pack sack first.
[05:09.960 --> 05:10.760]  Every episode.
[05:10.960 --> 05:12.140]  I have new sounds this week.
[05:12.380 --> 05:13.500]  What is this?
[05:13.540 --> 05:13.980]  I don't know.
[05:14.180 --> 05:17.700]  This is 1994 Tops Baseball Series 1.
[05:17.840 --> 05:18.940]  29 picture cards.
[05:19.120 --> 05:20.060]  Do you think these suck?
[05:20.500 --> 05:20.680]  Yeah.
[05:20.840 --> 05:23.320]  I don't think I've ever opened up 94 Tops before.
[05:23.520 --> 05:25.200]  I've never seen them packaged like this.
[05:25.780 --> 05:28.100]  Just in a gummy bears bag.
[05:28.280 --> 05:30.960]  Yeah, essentially it's a Haribo gummy bear bag.
[05:31.040 --> 05:31.780]  What were you doing in 94?
[05:32.600 --> 05:33.120]  I was in the army.
[05:33.300 --> 05:34.140]  I was in basic training.
[05:34.440 --> 05:36.640]  Yeah, I was climbing, running through the mud.
[05:37.800 --> 05:38.600]  Dodging bullets.
[05:38.920 --> 05:39.300]  Not really.
[05:39.780 --> 05:41.620]  Oh, there were no bullets to dodge.
[05:41.740 --> 05:43.360]  So these are stuck together as fuck.
[05:44.160 --> 05:46.480]  But if they weren't, this Deion Sanders card would have been nice.
[05:46.660 --> 05:47.880]  Oh, Deion, Deion.
[05:49.080 --> 05:50.240]  Wait, he played baseball?
[05:50.780 --> 05:51.240]  Deion Sanders?
[05:51.480 --> 05:51.680]  Yeah.
[05:51.860 --> 05:52.900]  That's what's so special about him.
[05:52.900 --> 05:55.180]  He played baseball and football at the same time.
[05:55.180 --> 05:57.600]  And was very, very good at both.
[05:57.740 --> 05:59.820]  And then now he's coaching college football.
[06:00.040 --> 06:03.980]  He also played both sides of the ball when he played football.
[06:04.280 --> 06:04.680]  Really?
[06:05.020 --> 06:06.260]  Yeah, he would just change his helmet.
[06:06.560 --> 06:09.300]  He would be a wide receiver and then he would play cornerback.
[06:09.420 --> 06:10.600]  He was a freak.
[06:10.900 --> 06:14.780]  That's why when people say Deion Sanders is one or two greatest athletes of all time,
[06:15.060 --> 06:15.860]  that's what they're talking about.
[06:15.880 --> 06:16.900]  Deion Sanders and Bo Jackson.
[06:17.100 --> 06:19.860]  A lot of the sport has changed and we've become very specialized.
[06:20.080 --> 06:22.480]  A lot of these guys could probably do both and no one does anymore,
[06:22.640 --> 06:24.720]  but it was very special to see that.
[06:24.720 --> 06:27.380]  And being a kid and even watching it go like this is incredible.
[06:27.600 --> 06:29.600]  Was that before or after Michael Jordan did it?
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.400]  Didn't he play baseball and basketball?
[06:31.700 --> 06:32.960]  Michael Jordan played double-A baseball.
[06:33.400 --> 06:34.340]  Same year, 94.
[06:34.980 --> 06:37.200]  But Deion played pro, like MLB.
[06:37.960 --> 06:38.260]  Jordan?
[06:38.600 --> 06:39.760]  No, Deion.
[06:39.920 --> 06:42.880]  Deion was an all-star in baseball and all-star...
[06:42.880 --> 06:43.100]  For real?
[06:43.440 --> 06:43.480]  Yeah.
[06:44.220 --> 06:46.220]  He was incredible.
[06:46.720 --> 06:48.100]  Yeah, Deion still is incredible.
[06:48.480 --> 06:49.860]  That's a good learning thing for me.
[06:50.440 --> 06:50.960]  There you go.
[06:51.180 --> 06:51.440]  Dang.
[06:51.880 --> 06:54.720]  There's a reason everyone's paying attention to the Buffs right now.
[06:54.840 --> 06:55.920]  No one cares about Colorado.
[06:56.200 --> 06:57.060]  They lost this week.
[06:57.300 --> 06:57.860]  And the week before.
[06:58.040 --> 06:59.120]  It was a good game.
[06:59.160 --> 06:59.280]  Yep.
[06:59.600 --> 07:00.080]  It was a good game.
[07:00.140 --> 07:00.760]  Is that the USC game?
[07:01.000 --> 07:01.160]  Yeah.
[07:01.920 --> 07:05.580]  Dave Martinez is stuck with Howard Johnson, so there's two.
[07:07.340 --> 07:09.120]  Steve Kersay is stuck with...
[07:09.120 --> 07:10.060]  These are...
[07:10.060 --> 07:10.900]  This is one solid card.
[07:10.900 --> 07:11.200]  That's chilling.
[07:11.420 --> 07:12.280]  Oh my God.
[07:12.540 --> 07:13.800]  You want some ASMR?
[07:14.100 --> 07:16.880]  Instead of pulling it, you gotta take them all.
[07:17.020 --> 07:17.360]  I'm gonna do it.
[07:17.420 --> 07:17.700]  There you go.
[07:20.540 --> 07:20.860]  Gross.
[07:21.360 --> 07:21.920]  Oh my God.
[07:22.860 --> 07:23.680]  These are fucked.
[07:24.700 --> 07:25.680]  They're upside down!
[07:25.960 --> 07:27.240]  Let's see what they would have been.
[07:28.020 --> 07:28.660]  Matt, no.
[07:28.760 --> 07:29.980]  These go straight in the trash can.
[07:30.060 --> 07:31.820]  These are garbage.
[07:32.140 --> 07:33.340]  Future Star, Eric Helfand.
[07:33.420 --> 07:34.120]  He was not a Future Star.
[07:34.120 --> 07:34.720]  No, he was not.
[07:34.880 --> 07:36.040]  That's the same card we already had!
[07:36.240 --> 07:37.400]  I picked it up and put it down.
[07:37.640 --> 07:37.900]  Oh, okay.
[07:39.040 --> 07:39.680]  Ricky Henderson.
[07:39.900 --> 07:40.220]  Damn!
[07:41.080 --> 07:41.840]  That would have been cool.
[07:41.960 --> 07:43.240]  I don't remember Ricky Henderson playing for the Blue Jays.
[07:43.300 --> 07:43.320]  What?
[07:43.320 --> 07:45.120]  I was gonna say, I don't remember him on the Blue Jays.
[07:45.160 --> 07:46.280]  So these would have been cool cards.
[07:46.280 --> 07:51.580]  There might have even been a tiny bit of value in some of these, but they are victims of age.
[07:52.100 --> 07:52.440]  Yep.
[07:53.980 --> 07:54.660]  Here you go.
[07:56.160 --> 07:56.840]  Whoever that is.
[07:56.900 --> 07:59.340]  Eric Popal, but that's a gold signature card.
[07:59.460 --> 08:00.160]  That's some sort of...
[08:00.160 --> 08:00.600]  This is neat.
[08:01.800 --> 08:04.420]  Alright, these are just...
[08:04.420 --> 08:05.860]  We'll just put these straight in the game.
[08:05.880 --> 08:06.000]  Garbage cards!
[08:06.540 --> 08:07.480]  That's why they were in the sack pack.
[08:08.000 --> 08:08.620]  Can back there.
[08:09.880 --> 08:10.240]  Drip bucket.
[08:10.460 --> 08:10.640]  Drip bucket.
[08:10.740 --> 08:11.080]  There you go.
[08:12.000 --> 08:13.400]  Okay, so that was the pack sack.
[08:13.400 --> 08:16.180]  Now, as you know, we've talked about it recently.
[08:16.840 --> 08:24.520]  We got that big Mark McGuire chase card that we wanted to get, and I talked about how I was going to send it off to get it graded.
[08:24.580 --> 08:26.020]  This will be the first time I've ever gotten anything graded.
[08:26.280 --> 08:28.700]  So I want to talk about the process of what that means.
[08:28.840 --> 08:33.880]  Now, when you submit to PSA, PSA is by far the number one grader.
[08:33.960 --> 08:39.660]  There's others, BGS, there's SGI, there's a bunch popped up in the pandemic and have already gone out of business.
[08:39.660 --> 08:43.880]  I would say go with PSA because they're the industry standard.
[08:45.620 --> 08:47.980]  They want you to submit cards.
[08:48.560 --> 08:49.780]  PSA graded 10 Snoopy.
[08:50.000 --> 08:50.380]  There you go.
[08:51.140 --> 08:52.740]  Is it PSA or WCO?
[08:52.920 --> 08:53.740]  No, that's WCO.
[08:53.740 --> 08:54.540]  That's one of the bullshits.
[08:54.640 --> 08:55.040]  It's WCO.
[08:55.360 --> 08:57.240]  It's worldclassgrading.com.
[08:57.620 --> 09:00.120]  So good cards go in top letters or one touches.
[09:00.940 --> 09:03.160]  PSA wants their cards submitted in card savers.
[09:03.420 --> 09:04.120]  So I brought some.
[09:04.220 --> 09:05.420]  I want to show you what they look like.
[09:05.420 --> 09:07.500]  It even says right here, the world's number one trading card holder.
[09:07.580 --> 09:07.920]  It's not.
[09:07.920 --> 09:12.020]  But it says crystal clear packet used by PSA and major PSA dealers.
[09:12.360 --> 09:18.180]  So this card that you've gotten is the rookie Mark McGuire Olympics card.
[09:18.320 --> 09:18.480]  Yes.
[09:18.560 --> 09:18.980]  Is that right?
[09:19.140 --> 09:19.340]  Yes.
[09:19.440 --> 09:22.160]  And this is a card that you knew about when you were younger.
[09:22.320 --> 09:23.500]  I always wanted it as a kid.
[09:23.680 --> 09:27.980]  And we talked about it when we were opening the pack and then we got it.
[09:28.080 --> 09:28.820]  It was a hit.
[09:29.120 --> 09:33.500]  So now we have a card that is potentially worth a little bit of scratch.
[09:33.640 --> 09:33.800]  Yeah.
[09:33.900 --> 09:36.600]  That can pay for weird signed basketballs and a bunch of other things.
[09:37.500 --> 09:37.900]  But...
[09:37.900 --> 09:40.940]  It can't just be, oh, here's this card.
[09:41.300 --> 09:47.720]  When you get it graded, now there is a professional company that says, it is this quality and this caliber.
[09:48.180 --> 09:51.280]  And that will determine the pricing that people could potentially buy it.
[09:51.540 --> 09:51.920]  Exactly.
[09:52.140 --> 09:55.040]  And this card is in pretty good shape and we're hoping for a good grade.
[09:55.100 --> 09:57.680]  If you got this in a PSA 10, it could be worth about $5,000.
[09:58.120 --> 09:58.460]  Dang.
[09:58.700 --> 10:00.500]  In a PSA 9, you're looking at a couple of hundred.
[10:00.660 --> 10:00.960]  Jesus.
[10:00.980 --> 10:03.440]  I think we're going to land somewhere in the couple hundred range.
[10:03.560 --> 10:04.780]  I looked up on PSA.
[10:04.780 --> 10:08.000]  I think I'm going to submit this via the slow way.
[10:08.160 --> 10:08.540]  It's $20.
[10:09.160 --> 10:11.500]  So, you put it in this card saver.
[10:11.760 --> 10:14.100]  Put a couple of pieces of cardboard on top of it.
[10:14.180 --> 10:16.720]  PSA asks that you rubber band them together, but not too tightly.
[10:16.800 --> 10:17.460]  And don't use tape.
[10:17.640 --> 10:19.860]  And then wrap that in bubble tape.
[10:19.980 --> 10:21.940]  And then put it in a box.
[10:22.460 --> 10:23.440]  And then send that to them.
[10:23.480 --> 10:26.160]  So that's what we're going to do between now and the next episode.
[10:26.220 --> 10:27.560]  And then you'll hear back in how long?
[10:27.940 --> 10:29.700]  I think I get this back in like 60 days.
[10:29.820 --> 10:32.260]  So, it used to be a lot faster.
[10:32.380 --> 10:32.560]  Yeah.
[10:32.560 --> 10:35.780]  And then Pokemon cards came back.
[10:36.040 --> 10:40.600]  And now that's the reason that you are waiting months for PSA grading.
[10:40.720 --> 10:42.180]  Is fucking Charizard.
[10:43.200 --> 10:46.080]  You get Pikachu and Pikablu.
[10:46.420 --> 10:50.380]  And now you have to get a PSA graded Charmander?
[10:50.520 --> 10:51.420]  No way. Get real.
[10:51.800 --> 10:52.260]  It's ridiculous.
[10:52.980 --> 10:54.260]  It's a luck card.
[10:54.540 --> 10:55.620]  Trash is what it is.
[10:55.740 --> 10:59.700]  Now, it's going to be interesting because the value, if it ends up grading PSA 10,
[10:59.800 --> 11:01.120]  they're going to charge me a lot more than $20.
[11:01.120 --> 11:02.500]  They might charge me a couple hundred.
[11:02.740 --> 11:04.280]  But that's okay if it's worth that much.
[11:04.360 --> 11:04.960]  We'll find out.
[11:05.120 --> 11:07.200]  I think I submitted in the lowest value.
[11:07.440 --> 11:10.540]  I think anything up to $500 is $20 to get graded.
[11:10.840 --> 11:13.740]  And then if they tell us it's more, they'll charge me more and I'll have to pay them back.
[11:13.860 --> 11:14.620]  I mean, that's pretty great.
[11:14.700 --> 11:16.040]  You're hoping that that's the case.
[11:16.220 --> 11:17.380]  Yeah. So that's the process.
[11:17.500 --> 11:18.520]  You put it in this card saver.
[11:18.900 --> 11:21.620]  Put some cardboard, stiff cardboard around it.
[11:21.700 --> 11:22.180]  Tape that.
[11:22.460 --> 11:22.820]  Or no, I'm sorry.
[11:22.880 --> 11:23.360]  Don't tape it.
[11:23.460 --> 11:23.940]  Rubber band it.
[11:24.060 --> 11:28.000]  And then put that in bubble wrap and then send it off in a hard box.
[11:28.080 --> 11:28.920]  They want it in a hard box.
[11:29.300 --> 11:29.900]  I will do that.
[11:29.900 --> 11:32.060]  And then in 60 days or so, we'll find out what we get.
[11:32.320 --> 11:34.120]  We'll open it up on this camera.
[11:34.120 --> 11:35.120]  I won't open it until we get it.
[11:35.180 --> 11:37.000]  Oh, we'll reveal what the grading is?
[11:37.040 --> 11:38.900]  I'll learn what the grade is with y'all on camera.
[11:39.060 --> 11:39.520]  That's exciting.
[11:39.800 --> 11:42.280]  What grade do you say this is not worth it and you rip it in half?
[11:44.640 --> 11:44.960]  Ooh.
[11:45.880 --> 11:46.200]  One.
[11:47.900 --> 11:49.220]  Then that can be the other thing.
[11:49.280 --> 11:49.880]  That's my childhood right here.
[11:50.160 --> 11:52.160]  Tune in to the next episode when we burn it.
[11:53.000 --> 11:53.320]  One.
[11:54.540 --> 11:58.420]  Next I want to open up, because I want to talk about Topps Chrome a little bit.
[11:58.460 --> 11:58.660]  Okay.
[11:58.660 --> 12:01.300]  Topps every year, they do this thing called...
[12:01.300 --> 12:02.400]  We'll just open up these and talk about it.
[12:02.500 --> 12:04.580]  They do a thing called a buyback program.
[12:04.760 --> 12:10.900]  And what that is, is they will give you an amount of money in credit at any local card shop.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.200]  All local card shops, I think, are a part of this.
[12:13.740 --> 12:17.620]  What they're trying to buy back this year is specifically Topps Chrome.
[12:17.860 --> 12:20.160]  They want to buy back any MVP cards.
[12:20.740 --> 12:26.880]  So what you do now is you collect all of the Topps Chrome cards of people you think are going to be an MVP.
[12:26.880 --> 12:28.680]  Who do you think is going to be the MVP this year?
[12:28.840 --> 12:29.280]  AL MVP?
[12:30.280 --> 12:33.660]  I mean, I would think it's Shohei probably on the AL side, I would think.
[12:33.780 --> 12:36.740]  So if you get the Topps Chrome Shohei base card, right?
[12:37.680 --> 12:39.140]  Actually, let me pull the pricing list up.
[12:39.240 --> 12:45.060]  If you get the base Shohei Otani card, and you hold on to it, and then he becomes the MVP...
[12:45.060 --> 12:45.260]  Yeah.
[12:45.680 --> 12:47.880]  Topps will then give you...
[12:49.020 --> 12:51.880]  Just for his base card, they will give you...
[12:53.160 --> 12:54.280]  Well, where did the...
[12:54.280 --> 12:55.500]  $20 is what it's worth.
[12:55.560 --> 12:55.720]  Okay.
[12:55.720 --> 12:56.720]  I can't find the pricing.
[12:58.740 --> 13:01.280]  But, and up to like, if it's numbered, they'll go up into the hundreds.
[13:01.500 --> 13:06.600]  So if you were to land like a, just a fucking bog standard, like one of these...
[13:06.600 --> 13:08.100]  Like if, well, can't use Roger Clemens.
[13:08.380 --> 13:08.600]  Yeah.
[13:08.660 --> 13:09.900]  Because he's not with us anymore.
[13:10.780 --> 13:12.100]  Here's El Jerez Montero.
[13:12.220 --> 13:13.880]  He is with us, he's not with us in the base anymore.
[13:13.880 --> 13:14.220]  I understand.
[13:14.580 --> 13:15.640]  Ivan Rodriguez, same.
[13:15.920 --> 13:17.700]  All right, Josh Donaldson, current player, right?
[13:18.020 --> 13:20.760]  If Josh Donaldson won the MVP, this card would be worth $20 immediately.
[13:20.960 --> 13:23.620]  Go to your local card shop, give it to them, they'll give you $20 in store credit.
[13:23.720 --> 13:23.980]  Really?
[13:24.200 --> 13:24.640]  You can buy whatever.
[13:24.640 --> 13:28.280]  I mean, if it helps, Josh Donaldson might not even be in the league.
[13:28.640 --> 13:29.180]  For sure, for sure.
[13:29.180 --> 13:30.720]  So he probably is not going to win MVP.
[13:31.620 --> 13:33.340]  Speaking of MVP though, here's Doc Gooden.
[13:33.520 --> 13:33.840]  Hey!
[13:35.120 --> 13:35.760]  Very cool.
[13:37.980 --> 13:38.720]  So there you go.
[13:39.040 --> 13:39.720]  Can I sleeve that?
[13:40.220 --> 13:42.520]  Yeah, let's go ahead and sleeve that, Doc Gooden.
[13:42.620 --> 13:45.560]  And then if you want to throw the Josh Donaldson card in the trash, that'd be fine too.
[13:47.700 --> 13:51.140]  So be on the lookout if you're opening up Topps Chrome and if you get any good players.
[13:51.180 --> 13:53.860]  If you get one of those that's numbered and they end up being the MVP,
[13:53.860 --> 13:54.820]  it's worth even more.
[13:54.920 --> 13:55.900]  You can get a couple hundred bucks.
[13:56.500 --> 13:58.180]  Here we got Dansby Swanson.
[13:58.500 --> 13:58.760]  Nice!
[13:58.800 --> 13:59.780]  That's a great baseball name.
[14:00.140 --> 14:00.540]  Fergie...
[14:00.540 --> 14:01.500]  That is a great...
[14:01.500 --> 14:01.900]  I think we...
[14:01.900 --> 14:02.680]  Yeah, let's pull it.
[14:02.820 --> 14:03.940]  I think we have them already.
[14:04.220 --> 14:04.580]  Good names.
[14:04.600 --> 14:05.700]  There we go, Fergie Jenkins.
[14:06.260 --> 14:06.740]  Hall of Famer.
[14:07.320 --> 14:07.660]  Who?
[14:07.800 --> 14:09.220]  Spencer Torkelson rookie.
[14:09.500 --> 14:10.300]  I'll take that.
[14:10.460 --> 14:11.800]  Let's go ahead and...
[14:11.800 --> 14:13.680]  He has a fucking scratch on it.
[14:13.760 --> 14:14.120]  Aww.
[14:14.840 --> 14:15.460]  That's okay.
[14:16.140 --> 14:18.720]  These cards can get scratches because they're kind of...
[14:18.720 --> 14:19.220]  Delicate.
[14:19.420 --> 14:19.680]  Yeah.
[14:21.360 --> 14:22.000]  Jose Barrios.
[14:22.160 --> 14:23.920]  And then a Wade Boggs.
[14:23.980 --> 14:25.360]  Boss Hogg, Wade Boggs.
[14:25.480 --> 14:25.720]  Nice.
[14:27.080 --> 14:27.760]  Refractor as well.
[14:28.060 --> 14:28.120]  Does he still play?
[14:28.120 --> 14:28.260]  No.
[14:28.260 --> 14:28.960]  He's retired.
[14:29.340 --> 14:33.980]  We did see a guy wearing a Wade Boggs Tampa Devil Rays jersey on the stream.
[14:33.980 --> 14:34.600]  Sloppy Joe stream.
[14:34.680 --> 14:36.100]  That'll go up Saturday, by the way.
[14:36.100 --> 14:36.460]  That's why.
[14:36.540 --> 14:37.660]  Did you guys have fun doing that?
[14:38.820 --> 14:42.040]  Yeah, watch the whole two fucking hours of us playing one game of bingo.
[14:42.040 --> 14:42.580]  It was a tough one.
[14:42.660 --> 14:43.160]  It was a tough one.
[14:43.280 --> 14:45.600]  Hey, if you want to play your own bingo...
[14:46.100 --> 14:46.740]  Sloppy Joe...
[14:46.740 --> 14:47.380]  Still available.
[14:47.520 --> 14:47.920]  Still on sale.
[14:47.920 --> 14:59.220]  Yeah, this contains a shirt, I think 50 bingo cards, and also three face daubers that are the little star.
[15:00.140 --> 15:01.040]  And it's awesome.
[15:01.360 --> 15:03.100]  I want to talk a little bit more about the buyback program.
[15:03.320 --> 15:05.520]  The T.O.P.S. buyback program is something that everybody knows about.
[15:05.620 --> 15:06.320]  They do it every year.
[15:06.320 --> 15:07.140]  Yeah, we get the money.
[15:07.300 --> 15:11.440]  It's a way to get a little bit of money off some common cards, or if you get a decent hit, a little bit more money.
[15:13.120 --> 15:13.460]  However...
[15:14.500 --> 15:15.620]  2023 Bowman Chrome.
[15:16.320 --> 15:17.900]  By the way, this is a $400 box.
[15:18.900 --> 15:19.220]  What?!
[15:19.220 --> 15:19.340]  Yeah.
[15:20.200 --> 15:21.660]  But it's different from T.O.P.S. Chrome.
[15:21.960 --> 15:25.780]  Yeah, T.O.P.S. owns both, but Bowman is a subsidiary of T.O.P.S.
[15:25.880 --> 15:26.080]  Okay.
[15:26.900 --> 15:30.980]  This Bowman Chrome specifically, they have a card in it called a Super Fractor.
[15:31.240 --> 15:31.460]  Okay.
[15:31.660 --> 15:33.540]  Now, that's what they call a one-of-one card.
[15:33.780 --> 15:37.720]  You know, we just call it one-of-one in other brands, but T.O.P.S. calls it a Super Fractor.
[15:37.940 --> 15:38.900]  It's supposed to be a one-of-one.
[15:39.400 --> 15:39.600]  Oh.
[15:39.640 --> 15:41.260]  One of the one-of-ones got pulled recently.
[15:41.380 --> 15:43.820]  Don't like the way you said it's supposed to be.
[15:44.840 --> 15:46.800]  I'm about to blow your mind, Eric.
[15:46.800 --> 15:48.620]  One of the one-of-one...
[15:48.620 --> 15:50.780]  Somebody pulled a one-of-one Super Fractor on a break the other day.
[15:50.820 --> 15:51.640]  I don't remember the player.
[15:52.340 --> 15:58.160]  But then a couple days later, someone else on a break pulled the same fucking Super Fractor of a one-of-one player.
[15:58.260 --> 15:59.740]  And it happened one more time.
[16:00.280 --> 16:03.020]  T.O.P.S. had to come out and acknowledge and say, we made a mistake.
[16:03.920 --> 16:08.360]  There are, I think, 90 or so one-of-ones in this product.
[16:08.620 --> 16:09.060]  What?!
[16:09.060 --> 16:12.340]  90 of them that we made two of.
[16:13.040 --> 16:16.280]  Like 90 different cards that are one-of-ones that they made two of.
[16:16.280 --> 16:16.920]  They doubled up on.
[16:17.100 --> 16:19.820]  So what T.O.P.S. has done is they're going to make it up to people.
[16:20.260 --> 16:24.160]  And they're going to buy back, if you want to sell, they'll buy back one.
[16:24.620 --> 16:27.480]  So the first person, like say if you get it and I get it, we both get a Roger Clemens.
[16:27.700 --> 16:30.020]  If you submit it first and that's good, then I just have the one-of-one.
[16:30.300 --> 16:35.080]  They will buy back all those one-of-one cards, or at least one of each.
[16:36.580 --> 16:38.980]  The bounty, the cheapest card they'll buy back.
[16:39.120 --> 16:40.500]  And these are mostly rookies.
[16:40.680 --> 16:42.480]  The cheapest card is $3,000.
[16:44.100 --> 16:47.380]  The most expensive that I found, because there's 90 cards to look through,
[16:47.480 --> 16:52.080]  the most expensive I found is this guy right here.
[16:53.140 --> 16:54.980]  Sebastian Walcott for the Texas Rangers.
[16:55.420 --> 16:58.860]  They will buy his Super Factor for $35,000.
[16:59.560 --> 17:01.940]  And that's $35,000 store credit?
[17:02.640 --> 17:03.040]  Oh, okay.
[17:03.160 --> 17:03.620]  This is cash.
[17:03.920 --> 17:06.400]  And do you think that his card will ever be worth that?
[17:06.640 --> 17:08.340]  Who is that? I've never even heard of him.
[17:08.460 --> 17:09.940]  I assume they'll take it and destroy it.
[17:10.020 --> 17:11.640]  I don't know because they want it to be one in existence.
[17:11.640 --> 17:14.800]  But if you got the second one and you were like, I'm going to hold on to it,
[17:14.840 --> 17:16.400]  it's not going to ever be worth $30,000.
[17:16.900 --> 17:21.840]  The problem with baseball prospects is it's such a speculative thing.
[17:22.320 --> 17:23.520]  And it's so hard to kill.
[17:23.640 --> 17:26.080]  For you to truly understand what's going on there,
[17:26.280 --> 17:28.240]  you have to watch a ton of minor leagues.
[17:28.340 --> 17:29.720]  You have to read scouting reports.
[17:30.620 --> 17:35.160]  99.9% of the people that are highly touted like that end up washing out.
[17:35.200 --> 17:35.960]  So you just don't know.
[17:36.180 --> 17:38.720]  So if you were to get that card, I would take that money instantly.
[17:38.840 --> 17:40.540]  But there's a lot of $10,000 cards.
[17:40.540 --> 17:42.140]  There's a lot of $15,000 cards.
[17:42.380 --> 17:44.600]  I bought this box because I thought that it would have them.
[17:44.700 --> 17:46.460]  I'm not really sure what's in it.
[17:46.660 --> 17:48.300]  I know that there are three autograph cards.
[17:48.340 --> 17:50.600]  I hope it's not only three autographs.
[17:50.600 --> 17:51.320]  Let's do it!
[17:51.480 --> 17:52.180]  Should we just open it up?
[17:52.300 --> 17:52.420]  Yeah!
[17:52.840 --> 17:54.220]  But one of these could be in there.
[17:54.740 --> 17:56.200]  This could be a $35,000 card.
[17:56.200 --> 17:58.600]  We're about to make $35,000!
[17:59.200 --> 18:00.600]  I'm going to get 70 Jet Skis!
[18:01.540 --> 18:01.900]  Two.
[18:02.100 --> 18:02.940]  You're going to get two Jet Skis.
[18:03.040 --> 18:05.420]  I love that they went, we'll pay cash.
[18:05.520 --> 18:06.740]  I wanted them to do credit.
[18:08.020 --> 18:11.280]  $35,000 of baseball card store credit.
[18:11.420 --> 18:15.560]  It's about $500,000 they're willing to put in to fix this mistake.
[18:15.600 --> 18:16.480]  So good on tops.
[18:16.620 --> 18:16.780]  Okay.
[18:18.220 --> 18:20.340]  Do you think that's cheaper than a lawsuit?
[18:20.760 --> 18:22.160]  Yes, I think that's cheaper than a lawsuit.
[18:23.020 --> 18:26.140]  And the fear is there might only be three autograph cards in here.
[18:26.300 --> 18:27.900]  These are non-autographed buybacks.
[18:28.040 --> 18:29.720]  So if it's an autographed card, it can't be a superfactor.
[18:29.760 --> 18:31.620]  The only time we're bummed about getting an autograph.
[18:32.320 --> 18:33.660]  So let's open this bad boy up.
[18:33.680 --> 18:34.920]  So how many packs are there in here?
[18:35.400 --> 18:35.720]  One.
[18:35.720 --> 18:36.600]  This is one pack.
[18:36.600 --> 18:37.800]  This is the craziest fucking shit.
[18:38.180 --> 18:38.300]  Three cards.
[18:38.360 --> 18:40.160]  So, well, three cards are autographs.
[18:40.200 --> 18:41.100]  This is more than three cards.
[18:41.380 --> 18:43.780]  So I do have it, we do have a shot, I think.
[18:44.260 --> 18:45.780]  I think we have a shot at getting a superfactor.
[18:45.820 --> 18:46.320]  Oh my God.
[18:47.140 --> 18:48.820]  Minimum $3,000 if we get one.
[18:51.360 --> 18:52.420]  What the fuck?
[18:53.260 --> 18:55.720]  Gotta figure out how to make money on this, I really want to.
[18:55.820 --> 18:56.500]  Alright, here we go.
[18:57.320 --> 18:57.680]  Ready?
[18:58.220 --> 18:58.520]  Alright.
[18:58.820 --> 19:00.060]  Ooh, I'm scared.
[19:00.700 --> 19:04.900]  And I'm going to need somebody to look these up because I don't know the value of this shit off the top of my head.
[19:04.900 --> 19:10.660]  We have a Yonatan Enriquez on-card Bowman First auto.
[19:11.140 --> 19:11.160]  Okay.
[19:11.300 --> 19:12.840]  So if somebody could Google that.
[19:12.860 --> 19:13.220]  What?
[19:14.260 --> 19:14.620]  You got that?
[19:15.260 --> 19:16.340]  Chat, let us know.
[19:16.460 --> 19:17.400]  Look it up, you're faster.
[19:17.700 --> 19:18.700]  I don't know what I'm looking up.
[19:19.100 --> 19:24.100]  We have a Luis Torres gold Bowman First, numbered to 50.
[19:24.320 --> 19:25.880]  So these are not superfactors.
[19:25.880 --> 19:26.780]  We didn't get a superfactor.
[19:27.180 --> 19:33.080]  And then this is numbered to $499, Spence Kaufman for the San Diego Padres.
[19:33.080 --> 19:35.920]  So these are all three autos.
[19:36.100 --> 19:36.280]  Yep.
[19:36.700 --> 19:37.780]  All three on-card.
[19:38.520 --> 19:41.440]  Yeah, he's got, it looks like he's got like a Batman mask on.
[19:42.320 --> 19:44.360]  These are very, very nice.
[19:44.600 --> 19:47.140]  I'll have to price these out and see what they're worth.
[19:48.160 --> 19:49.440]  No superfactor in this.
[19:49.580 --> 19:54.220]  And if you want to get a superfactor, don't buy this box because it only has auto cards and those auto cards can't be...
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.620]  I'm just going to put them back in here like this for now.
[19:57.220 --> 19:59.140]  Do you know anything about the Padre guy?
[19:59.140 --> 20:03.160]  I think he's one of our player league prospects.
[20:03.560 --> 20:04.600]  Yeah, these would all be.
[20:05.280 --> 20:07.420]  He's a young guy coming up.
[20:07.920 --> 20:09.640]  So that's not the box we want.
[20:10.400 --> 20:12.320]  No, I could have bought a cheaper box that would have been the box we want.
[20:12.360 --> 20:14.240]  But that's okay because these might be...
[20:14.240 --> 20:18.460]  I mean, honestly, for $400, if any of those is a hit, it's probably worth more than $400.
[20:18.560 --> 20:21.000]  But maybe next week we can get that box if we go to the store.
[20:21.140 --> 20:21.300]  Yeah.
[20:21.500 --> 20:25.820]  And next week we'll find out what these were worth if nobody in the audience can tell us real quick like.
[20:25.860 --> 20:28.260]  Okay, so don't forget we have a basketball to open at the end of the show.
[20:28.260 --> 20:30.160]  Yeah, we're going to open the big-ass basketball at the end of the show.
[20:30.160 --> 20:31.200]  You want to get into some regular packs? What do you want to do?
[20:31.220 --> 20:34.140]  Yeah, let's open a little bit of what for? What do we got here?
[20:34.320 --> 20:35.480]  Could it be a Michael Jordan basketball?
[20:36.380 --> 20:38.000]  I don't know. I don't know.
[20:38.280 --> 20:43.140]  It came with this pack of F1, Topps F1 cards from International Trading Card Day.
[20:43.220 --> 20:46.340]  It did. At the bottom, Gracie was taking it out of the box and she was like, oh, it's a basketball.
[20:46.580 --> 20:49.020]  What's this? And it's just a pack of cards.
[20:49.920 --> 20:52.420]  So we got Nico Hulkenberg. These are obviously F1 cards.
[20:52.480 --> 20:53.400]  Kevin Magnussen.
[20:53.620 --> 20:53.920]  Uh-huh.
[20:54.520 --> 20:54.840]  Booyah!
[20:55.580 --> 20:56.220]  Max Verstappen.
[20:56.280 --> 20:57.500]  Max Verstappen.
[20:57.500 --> 20:58.700]  Yuki Tsunoda.
[20:58.960 --> 20:59.320]  Mm-hmm.
[20:59.420 --> 21:00.900]  And Esteban Ocon.
[21:01.140 --> 21:01.420]  Nice!
[21:01.420 --> 21:03.380]  So let's sleeve that maxi.
[21:04.600 --> 21:05.780]  That might be worth a couple bucks.
[21:06.060 --> 21:06.600]  Number one with a bullet.
[21:09.100 --> 21:10.860]  Made racing pretty boring.
[21:11.280 --> 21:11.420]  Yeah.
[21:11.600 --> 21:12.980]  Let's get off the sports for a second.
[21:13.100 --> 21:15.000]  Eric, you gave me these Twilight cards.
[21:15.080 --> 21:19.940]  So these came from one of our producers here, Jillian, who just went to Forks, Washington.
[21:20.580 --> 21:24.720]  She got these cards and she produces Red Web.
[21:25.180 --> 21:26.040]  You can check out Red Web.
[21:26.040 --> 21:27.580]  She's like, hey, check these out.
[21:27.640 --> 21:28.380]  You guys want to open these?
[21:28.440 --> 21:29.640]  And I said, absolutely.
[21:30.140 --> 21:31.200]  So these are from her.
[21:31.760 --> 21:32.660]  Thank you, Jillian.
[21:32.840 --> 21:33.260]  And her friends.
[21:33.440 --> 21:36.740]  Now, is Eclipse one of the movies, I guess?
[21:37.100 --> 21:37.820]  The second one?
[21:38.100 --> 21:41.740]  RVB Connor says that Luis Torres is going for $500 at my local shop.
[21:41.980 --> 21:42.240]  There you go.
[21:42.300 --> 21:43.160]  So we made our money back.
[21:43.220 --> 21:43.620]  Hey, hopefully.
[21:44.240 --> 21:44.680]  Holy shit.
[21:44.820 --> 21:45.640]  I'll get that graded movie.
[21:45.920 --> 21:47.200]  So this is from the third movie.
[21:47.420 --> 21:48.120]  The third movie.
[21:48.280 --> 21:49.180]  Okay, I only saw the first one.
[21:49.200 --> 21:50.040]  If Jillian was here, she could tell us.
[21:50.560 --> 21:51.280]  There's Brie.
[21:52.740 --> 21:53.400]  There's Brie.
[21:53.460 --> 21:54.100]  There's Brie.
[21:54.740 --> 21:56.020]  There's Seth Clearwater.
[21:56.020 --> 21:56.600]  Wow.
[21:56.600 --> 21:57.580]  What a fucking name.
[21:57.920 --> 21:58.420]  There he is.
[21:59.080 --> 22:01.980]  This doesn't look anything like a bloodbath, but I guess it is.
[22:02.140 --> 22:03.240]  Is that the dad, Carlisle?
[22:04.820 --> 22:05.640]  Is he a dad?
[22:06.100 --> 22:07.000]  Yeah, they're vampires.
[22:07.140 --> 22:07.580]  They don't age.
[22:08.160 --> 22:10.580]  Oh, so he might be a dad.
[22:10.840 --> 22:11.920]  I think he's like Edward's dad.
[22:11.920 --> 22:14.320]  I guess you're stuck at whatever age you were when you got sucked.
[22:14.500 --> 22:15.980]  Well, I think that they make...
[22:15.980 --> 22:18.280]  I think that they, like, choose their family.
[22:18.680 --> 22:19.940]  I don't think they're like blood relatives.
[22:19.960 --> 22:20.820]  Yeah, I just don't know.
[22:20.960 --> 22:21.460]  They drink blood.
[22:21.960 --> 22:22.300]  That's true.
[22:22.500 --> 22:22.980]  They do drink blood.
[22:23.020 --> 22:23.640]  Hey, check it out.
[22:23.640 --> 22:24.300]  Jersey Shore.
[22:24.400 --> 22:25.300]  Hey, forks.
[22:25.340 --> 22:25.600]  Probably.
[22:27.240 --> 22:27.940]  Who's there?
[22:28.120 --> 22:28.500]  Knock, knock.
[22:28.940 --> 22:29.580]  It's a vampire.
[22:29.800 --> 22:30.200]  You're dead.
[22:30.240 --> 22:30.660]  He's there.
[22:30.760 --> 22:33.620]  And then here's a picture of a vampire with a terrible, terrible haircut.
[22:33.820 --> 22:34.860]  Oh, that's the, like...
[22:34.860 --> 22:39.080]  Hey, the max buyback price for the Super Fractors is $75,000.
[22:39.420 --> 22:39.600]  Oh.
[22:39.600 --> 22:40.820]  And it's an Ethan Solis card.
[22:41.000 --> 22:41.700]  Oh, there you go.
[22:41.720 --> 22:42.280]  Ethan Solis is a Padre.
[22:42.540 --> 22:43.200]  Ethan Solis card.
[22:43.240 --> 22:43.360]  There you go.
[22:43.360 --> 22:45.280]  So you get as much as 75 grand back.
[22:45.320 --> 22:45.680]  Dad.
[22:45.860 --> 22:46.860]  Also, by the way...
[22:46.860 --> 22:47.580]  Got Padre's fever, baby.
[22:47.780 --> 22:50.360]  You might notice I'm drinking my Coke out of a...
[22:50.360 --> 22:50.820]  Anima!
[22:50.820 --> 22:51.860]  Anima mug today.
[22:51.860 --> 22:54.180]  You can see that it's not changing colors because that's a cold soda.
[22:54.540 --> 22:54.660]  Mm.
[22:55.780 --> 22:56.100]  Mm.
[22:56.420 --> 22:57.700]  It'll change colors on hot.
[22:57.880 --> 22:58.780]  It changes colors on hot.
[22:58.800 --> 22:59.860]  So if you have a hot soda...
[22:59.860 --> 23:00.240]  It wakes up.
[23:00.360 --> 23:01.120]  ...put it in there.
[23:01.480 --> 23:01.800]  Nice.
[23:02.240 --> 23:04.560]  Uh, now we have these...
[23:04.560 --> 23:06.280]  Eric, we have Sabotage Wrestling.
[23:06.940 --> 23:11.360]  Sabotage Professional Wrestling is a independent professional wrestling company out of Austin, Texas.
[23:11.600 --> 23:11.940]  That's where we are.
[23:12.060 --> 23:14.420]  They comped us some tickets to their last show.
[23:14.580 --> 23:16.420]  Me and a couple friends went, had a really good time.
[23:16.500 --> 23:17.580]  And they said, here's some cards.
[23:17.820 --> 23:17.920]  Nice.
[23:17.920 --> 23:18.240]  Said, open them.
[23:18.340 --> 23:18.700]  Said, okay.
[23:19.020 --> 23:20.300]  Let's see if I know who any of these people are.
[23:20.300 --> 23:21.080]  Let's see if you do.
[23:21.340 --> 23:21.820]  All right.
[23:23.040 --> 23:23.400]  Uh...
[23:23.400 --> 23:26.680]  First up, we have After the Smoke Clears.
[23:26.860 --> 23:27.120]  Oh!
[23:27.560 --> 23:28.140]  Very cool.
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.440]  Dr. Rosa and Sammy Guevara on the top right and left.
[23:31.720 --> 23:32.240]  Oh, Sammy Guevara.
[23:32.340 --> 23:32.700]  I knew that.
[23:32.900 --> 23:34.640]  They're AEW professional wrestlers.
[23:34.680 --> 23:34.920]  Yeah.
[23:35.640 --> 23:37.520]  War of the Genders 3.
[23:37.820 --> 23:41.300]  War of the Genders is where they do all of their matches are intergender matches.
[23:41.420 --> 23:42.160]  So the men fight the women.
[23:42.320 --> 23:44.160]  And they just had a show of that.
[23:44.200 --> 23:45.180]  And it was fucking awesome.
[23:45.360 --> 23:48.400]  Did you know, Eric, that hatred knows no gender?
[23:48.400 --> 23:50.560]  You know, I hadn't considered that.
[23:50.780 --> 23:52.600]  Here we have Hey Ladies!
[23:53.200 --> 23:56.700]  Hey Ladies is their all-women's wrestling show.
[23:57.020 --> 23:57.160]  Okay.
[23:57.280 --> 23:57.940]  That is very good.
[23:58.220 --> 24:00.140]  Their Hey Ladies show is probably my favorite show of the year this year.
[24:00.240 --> 24:01.700]  This is our Austin-themed one, clearly.
[24:01.840 --> 24:02.740]  Come and take it!
[24:02.820 --> 24:05.420]  That is the venue that it takes place at.
[24:05.560 --> 24:11.320]  If there were a slogan to the city of Austin, it'd probably be keep Austin weird, which is fucking lame.
[24:11.560 --> 24:12.560]  But it should be come and take it.
[24:12.860 --> 24:13.180]  Hell yeah.
[24:13.580 --> 24:16.560]  If you want to know why we say come and take it here, you should read up on the history of it.
[24:16.600 --> 24:17.340]  It's fucking fascinating.
[24:17.340 --> 24:19.620]  It makes Austinites look badass.
[24:19.760 --> 24:20.120]  It's fucking cool.
[24:21.400 --> 24:22.120]  Royal Grounds.
[24:22.640 --> 24:22.660]  Nice.
[24:23.220 --> 24:23.760]  This is cool.
[24:24.360 --> 24:25.300]  They have a...
[24:25.300 --> 24:27.560]  Most of these people are, like, on TV.
[24:27.740 --> 24:28.740]  They all look like movie posters.
[24:28.960 --> 24:29.540]  They are, yeah.
[24:31.440 --> 24:34.940]  They're, like, video editing.
[24:35.280 --> 24:37.300]  All of their, like, photo editing.
[24:37.420 --> 24:38.000]  All this stuff.
[24:38.080 --> 24:39.680]  Their graphic design is, like, top-notch.
[24:39.740 --> 24:40.080]  Yeah, this is...
[24:40.080 --> 24:41.060]  This is, like, high-quality stuff.
[24:41.060 --> 24:43.480]  Speaking of top-notch, if you're ever in Austin, get a burger at Top Notch.
[24:43.480 --> 24:43.920]  Try Top Notch.
[24:44.020 --> 24:44.600]  It's the best.
[24:44.600 --> 24:45.520]  Try real burgers.
[24:45.620 --> 24:46.240]  Best burgers in town.
[24:46.740 --> 24:47.120]  Vendetta.
[24:47.260 --> 24:48.820]  That was way back on August 31st.
[24:48.840 --> 24:51.420]  Does anybody remember November 16th, 2019?
[24:51.700 --> 24:52.340]  Where were you?
[24:52.480 --> 24:55.540]  I was after the smoke clears two.
[24:55.700 --> 24:56.180]  Hell, yeah.
[24:56.280 --> 24:58.060]  Unless it's after the smoke two clears.
[24:58.580 --> 25:00.940]  No, I think it's after the smoke clears two.
[25:01.100 --> 25:02.060]  You remember War of the Genders?
[25:02.260 --> 25:02.600]  Three.
[25:02.700 --> 25:03.800]  How about War of the Genders four?
[25:03.940 --> 25:04.560]  Four, baby.
[25:04.780 --> 25:05.520]  There's even more.
[25:05.680 --> 25:06.280]  Yeah, there are.
[25:06.420 --> 25:06.840]  They keep doing it.
[25:06.840 --> 25:08.320]  Then the fire burns again.
[25:08.380 --> 25:08.520]  Yep.
[25:09.100 --> 25:12.740]  And then I think the reason that we did it was for the thrill of it all.
[25:12.780 --> 25:13.300]  There you go.
[25:13.300 --> 25:16.300]  They have a show coming up pretty soon down in...
[25:16.880 --> 25:19.440]  I think it's the Pinball's Kingdom in Buda.
[25:19.620 --> 25:20.060]  Oh.
[25:20.620 --> 25:21.200]  That's cool.
[25:21.580 --> 25:22.260]  It's a cool little venue.
[25:23.600 --> 25:26.060]  Next we got FLIR 91 Football.
[25:26.280 --> 25:27.580]  Let me tell you a little bit about these cards.
[25:28.040 --> 25:31.320]  These were given to me by my wonderful daughter.
[25:32.280 --> 25:32.920]  Oh, me!
[25:33.180 --> 25:33.660]  Is that right?
[25:33.780 --> 25:35.640]  Yeah, she was shopping the other day at a...
[25:35.640 --> 25:37.360]  I don't know, like a clothing store or something.
[25:37.480 --> 25:37.760]  Cool.
[25:38.140 --> 25:40.220]  And they had them, so she picked them up for me.
[25:40.540 --> 25:43.280]  So we got John Grimsley from the Miami Dolphins.
[25:43.280 --> 25:44.840]  This is when they had big shoulder pads.
[25:45.940 --> 25:46.820]  Robert Brown.
[25:47.420 --> 25:48.300]  Geoff Bostick.
[25:48.380 --> 25:49.560]  I've never seen these cards before.
[25:50.380 --> 25:50.900]  Oh, here you go.
[25:50.940 --> 25:51.540]  Ricky Waters.
[25:53.640 --> 25:55.100]  Is that a college card?
[25:55.260 --> 25:55.560]  I guess.
[25:55.960 --> 25:56.760]  Yeah, it's Notre Dame.
[25:57.160 --> 25:58.800]  I guess you should sleeve that.
[25:59.120 --> 25:59.760]  Who's he?
[26:00.120 --> 26:01.700]  Ricky Waters, he was an NFL player.
[26:02.020 --> 26:02.380]  Really?
[26:03.060 --> 26:03.380]  He was okay.
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.160]  He was a running back.
[26:05.440 --> 26:05.980]  Don Beebe.
[26:07.500 --> 26:10.500]  Ray Childress, back in the now defunct Houston Oilers.
[26:11.260 --> 26:14.260]  All-time great Marcus Allen for the Raiders.
[26:14.660 --> 26:16.760]  Louis Billups for the Bengals.
[26:16.980 --> 26:20.460]  Boy, what a fall from grace the Bengals have had this season.
[26:20.940 --> 26:23.060]  Steve Atwater, fantastic player.
[26:23.680 --> 26:26.280]  Steve DeBerg, not as well known as Steve Atwater.
[26:26.820 --> 26:28.380]  Gary Anderson with the...
[26:28.380 --> 26:29.560]  Nice little boot there.
[26:30.380 --> 26:31.740]  A little kick, a little kicky foot.
[26:32.020 --> 26:32.460]  A little kicky foot.
[26:33.040 --> 26:34.280]  Marion Butts.
[26:34.460 --> 26:34.800]  Nice.
[26:35.360 --> 26:36.280]  Body part.
[26:36.720 --> 26:38.080]  I was a big Marion Butts fan.
[26:38.240 --> 26:38.440]  Were you?
[26:38.520 --> 26:38.720]  Yeah.
[26:38.720 --> 26:39.260]  Oh, yeah.
[26:39.340 --> 26:41.840]  Yeah, because I was a kid and his name was Marion Butts.
[26:42.400 --> 26:42.600]  Marion Butts, yeah.
[26:43.600 --> 26:45.620]  Brian Blades, that's pretty cool, too.
[26:46.060 --> 26:48.540]  And then Neil Anderson, those Bears running back.
[26:48.780 --> 26:49.800]  Thank you, Millicent.
[26:49.860 --> 26:52.740]  She got me a few more of those, too, so we'll open them at some point.
[26:53.340 --> 26:56.320]  Now, I wanted to open this last week, but I kind of wanted to wait for Eric to come back.
[26:56.340 --> 26:57.000]  So here we are.
[26:57.380 --> 26:58.380]  Here's the limited edition.
[26:58.420 --> 26:59.380]  I got one pack of these.
[26:59.480 --> 27:00.780]  What, are you hoping Rocco's in here or what?
[27:00.780 --> 27:04.920]  Yeah, YouTube, I guarantee you nobody from Rooster Teeth will be in here.
[27:05.380 --> 27:08.720]  Let's find out from the YouTube Shorts Trading Creator Trading Cards.
[27:08.840 --> 27:09.300]  Let's do it.
[27:09.700 --> 27:10.840]  What year is this?
[27:11.600 --> 27:12.920]  This is from...
[27:14.000 --> 27:14.980]  Not For Sale.
[27:15.720 --> 27:17.040]  This is from Not For Sale.
[27:18.180 --> 27:19.700]  It doesn't even fucking say.
[27:19.820 --> 27:21.780]  It could be...
[27:21.780 --> 27:23.640]  Oh, there's a bunch of creators I've never heard of.
[27:23.820 --> 27:25.120]  Cool, yeah, I mean, that sounds...
[27:25.120 --> 27:26.740]  That was pretty much what I was anticipating here.
[27:27.200 --> 27:28.120]  Yeah, all right.
[27:29.440 --> 27:31.720]  Let's open this bad boy up and see who we got.
[27:32.620 --> 27:34.420]  I'm hoping for Mr. Beast, personally.
[27:34.420 --> 27:35.080]  Wow.
[27:36.820 --> 27:37.620]  Kaitlyn Christine.
[27:38.080 --> 27:38.480]  Wow.
[27:38.840 --> 27:39.940]  Let me know if you know any of these people.
[27:41.040 --> 27:41.840]  Kevin Langu.
[27:42.140 --> 27:42.720]  You got it, man.
[27:42.780 --> 27:43.500]  I'll let you know.
[27:44.060 --> 27:46.020]  Then, oh, here's a YouTube sticker.
[27:46.440 --> 27:48.400]  Ooh, you put that on your...
[27:48.400 --> 27:48.720]  I don't know.
[27:48.780 --> 27:49.280]  Yeah, I could.
[27:49.640 --> 27:50.160]  Oh, here we go.
[27:50.500 --> 27:51.620]  Squirmy and Grubs.
[27:52.120 --> 27:53.980]  Everybody loves Squirmy and Grubs.
[27:54.180 --> 27:55.280]  Squirmy and Grubs.
[27:55.360 --> 27:55.500]  Great.
[27:55.560 --> 27:56.780]  Oh, I recognize that guy.
[27:57.060 --> 28:00.620]  And then, oh, we got a parallel of Kevin Langu.
[28:00.800 --> 28:04.280]  Oh, wow, dude, this might be a Kevin Langu show.
[28:04.280 --> 28:05.040]  Let's leave it.
[28:05.640 --> 28:06.460]  Why not?
[28:07.180 --> 28:08.400]  What do we do next?
[28:08.620 --> 28:10.980]  He has 285,000 subs.
[28:11.720 --> 28:13.380]  His favorite food is mint chocolate ice cream.
[28:13.580 --> 28:15.280]  That, I think Mega 64 is more than that.
[28:15.340 --> 28:15.820]  I'm just saying.
[28:16.680 --> 28:18.600]  Let's see who has the most subs out of here.
[28:18.640 --> 28:20.280]  Get Garrett on one of these cards now.
[28:20.420 --> 28:24.660]  This girl, Kaitlyn Christine, has 253,000 subs.
[28:24.760 --> 28:26.080]  And her favorite food is cinnamon buns.
[28:26.720 --> 28:27.720]  I feel like a cinnamon bun.
[28:27.780 --> 28:28.400]  Her biggest weakness?
[28:28.740 --> 28:29.780]  Buying new costumes.
[28:32.780 --> 28:33.220]  Superpower?
[28:33.220 --> 28:34.000]  Shapeshifting.
[28:34.240 --> 28:35.200]  That's... okay.
[28:38.020 --> 28:39.160]  That is a good superpower to have.
[28:39.180 --> 28:40.220]  Oh, my gosh, this...
[28:42.220 --> 28:43.580]  These people...
[28:43.580 --> 28:43.720]  Yeah.
[28:44.320 --> 28:47.660]  The Squirmy and Grubs, they're a married couple.
[28:48.680 --> 28:52.080]  And her biggest weakness is making phone calls.
[28:52.420 --> 28:53.540]  His biggest weakness?
[28:53.880 --> 28:54.340]  Legs.
[28:57.320 --> 28:58.160]  He's funny.
[28:58.420 --> 28:59.160]  That's pretty funny.
[28:59.580 --> 29:00.300]  What are we looking at?
[29:00.300 --> 29:02.560]  Next we do Select 23, NBA Wolves.
[29:02.580 --> 29:04.220]  This is gonna be the pack sack pack,
[29:04.360 --> 29:06.220]  because as you know, when you open up cards,
[29:06.340 --> 29:07.460]  you have to feed the pack sack.
[29:07.540 --> 29:09.860]  Speaking of the pack sack, it's getting pretty full,
[29:10.200 --> 29:11.660]  and somebody mentioned the other day,
[29:11.720 --> 29:12.940]  hey, the pack sack's looking pretty full,
[29:13.260 --> 29:14.840]  you should have a pack sack only episode
[29:14.840 --> 29:15.600]  where you just clear it out.
[29:15.600 --> 29:16.120]  That's a great idea.
[29:16.300 --> 29:17.960]  So I think we'll do that sometime in the near future.
[29:18.480 --> 29:20.020]  In the meantime, we're gonna open up these.
[29:20.280 --> 29:22.160]  Clearly here, we're looking for...
[29:23.000 --> 29:23.620]  Drew Holliday.
[29:23.840 --> 29:24.240]  I don't fucking know.
[29:25.780 --> 29:26.640]  Let's see who we get.
[29:26.640 --> 29:29.060]  Tyrese Halliburton, SGA.
[29:29.300 --> 29:30.000]  Look at that card.
[29:30.300 --> 29:32.280]  Nice quality control, Panini.
[29:32.380 --> 29:34.360]  Look at that scratch right there from his hand down.
[29:34.400 --> 29:35.340]  Check this out. Trash.
[29:35.480 --> 29:36.780]  That means that's worthless.
[29:37.200 --> 29:37.480]  Trash.
[29:40.120 --> 29:41.940]  Jaden Ivey, rookie base,
[29:42.140 --> 29:44.940]  and then Joel Embiid, Orange Shock Prism.
[29:45.320 --> 29:46.000]  Is that what they call it?
[29:46.740 --> 29:49.220]  Didn't he tweet this week about the off-season or something?
[29:49.840 --> 29:51.180]  Yeah, he said it was really entertaining.
[29:51.340 --> 29:52.700]  But then he said LMAO.
[29:54.200 --> 29:56.320]  If you're not an NBA fan,
[29:56.320 --> 29:57.640]  it has been a very entertaining week.
[29:57.640 --> 29:58.240]  It's been a good time.
[29:58.320 --> 29:58.980]  It's been a really good time.
[29:59.120 --> 30:02.320]  Bad off-season if you're a Miami Heat fan.
[30:02.480 --> 30:02.860]  Dude.
[30:03.140 --> 30:04.100]  Or a Celtics fan.
[30:04.220 --> 30:05.260]  Good if you're a Celtics fan.
[30:05.300 --> 30:07.060]  Do you like everybody they've gotten rid of?
[30:07.400 --> 30:09.400]  No, I love everybody they got rid of.
[30:09.440 --> 30:09.620]  Yeah.
[30:10.000 --> 30:11.980]  But I understand the reason for getting rid of them,
[30:12.060 --> 30:13.900]  and I think that the team is constructed better.
[30:14.140 --> 30:17.780]  Adding Drew Holliday is really something.
[30:18.260 --> 30:18.500]  Yeah.
[30:19.360 --> 30:22.540]  If he stays healthy into the playoffs,
[30:23.100 --> 30:24.060]  that's a difference maker.
[30:24.640 --> 30:30.580]  There are two people I think that they could replace Marcus Smart with.
[30:30.900 --> 30:32.640]  And get the same effect out of.
[30:32.940 --> 30:35.580]  Drew Holliday, who is arguably as good,
[30:35.660 --> 30:37.000]  if not better, everybody's going to say better,
[30:37.120 --> 30:37.600]  but I'm smart.
[30:38.280 --> 30:39.200]  I'm a member of the smart.
[30:39.220 --> 30:39.520]  We get it.
[30:39.840 --> 30:40.780]  Or Desmond Bain.
[30:41.040 --> 30:43.560]  Those are the only two players in the NBA that I think that play the game
[30:43.560 --> 30:45.200]  Marcus Smart plays as well as he plays it.
[30:45.320 --> 30:47.220]  And so I'm happy that if we were going to lose him,
[30:47.300 --> 30:50.600]  we get a very, I assume, pissed off Drew Holliday,
[30:50.680 --> 30:53.140]  who only wanted to retire in the Rocky.
[30:53.140 --> 30:54.100]  He wanted to stay.
[30:54.300 --> 30:55.540]  And did not want to go.
[30:55.660 --> 30:57.060]  He's the second best player on that fucking team.
[30:57.280 --> 30:57.320]  Yeah.
[30:57.500 --> 31:01.620]  And so then dumping him was to get Damian Lillard.
[31:01.880 --> 31:05.140]  I'm hoping now we get a Drew Holliday with a chip on his shoulder
[31:05.140 --> 31:07.700]  who wants to show Milwaukee they made a huge fucking mistake
[31:07.700 --> 31:08.160]  by getting Damian Lillard.
[31:08.160 --> 31:09.060]  Well, he's in a contract here too, right?
[31:09.080 --> 31:09.280]  Yeah.
[31:09.440 --> 31:10.020]  I like that.
[31:10.320 --> 31:12.440]  So Blake Wesley, base rookie.
[31:13.380 --> 31:14.260]  RJ Barrett.
[31:15.520 --> 31:16.360]  Love that dude.
[31:16.900 --> 31:17.720]  LaMelo Ball.
[31:18.460 --> 31:18.920]  What is it?
[31:19.000 --> 31:19.240]  C!
[31:20.240 --> 31:21.140]  Yeah, like C!
[31:21.700 --> 31:22.900]  Yeah, that's what he's doing.
[31:23.020 --> 31:25.220]  Jimmy Butler, who also...
[31:25.220 --> 31:26.560]  What a character that Jimmy Butler is.
[31:26.720 --> 31:30.640]  If you didn't see, today is media day for the NBA
[31:30.980 --> 31:32.440]  where they roll out the new teams.
[31:32.740 --> 31:35.140]  And Jimmy Butler always does a fun haircut for it.
[31:35.320 --> 31:37.140]  He did emo Jimmy Butler today.
[31:37.320 --> 31:37.760]  Oh my God.
[31:37.760 --> 31:39.400]  He got his hair straightened and like...
[31:39.400 --> 31:39.800]  No way.
[31:39.880 --> 31:40.360]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:40.440 --> 31:41.060]  It's pretty great.
[31:41.120 --> 31:41.800]  It's really funny.
[31:41.960 --> 31:42.780]  There's a prism.
[31:43.160 --> 31:46.100]  I like him, even though it's always an issue at the playoffs.
[31:46.120 --> 31:49.240]  I hate playing against Jimmy Butler because I'm a Celtics fan.
[31:49.240 --> 31:51.720]  But Jimmy Butler is a goddamn treasure.
[31:51.920 --> 31:53.060]  Stop it.
[31:53.600 --> 31:55.140]  That's how he showed up for media day today.
[31:55.600 --> 31:56.320]  That's a wig.
[31:56.780 --> 31:58.640]  No, he had his hair straightened the whole video.
[31:58.760 --> 31:59.520]  Oh my God.
[31:59.600 --> 32:00.900]  Yeah, Jimmy Butler fucking rules.
[32:01.140 --> 32:02.120]  Jimmy Butler does not screw around.
[32:02.180 --> 32:03.200]  When he does something, he does it.
[32:03.500 --> 32:04.080]  I like him.
[32:04.340 --> 32:05.200]  You gotta love Jimmy Butler.
[32:05.340 --> 32:06.680]  I just wish he didn't play on the heat.
[32:08.220 --> 32:10.280]  Would he have fit well on the Celtics or no?
[32:10.740 --> 32:11.740]  He'd fit well anywhere.
[32:12.060 --> 32:14.240]  Although he didn't in Philly for some reason, which is weird.
[32:14.380 --> 32:15.340]  Philly's a whole other...
[32:15.340 --> 32:16.460]  But Philly's got other...
[32:16.460 --> 32:17.520]  Yeah, I don't want to...
[32:17.520 --> 32:18.800]  He's not trusting the process.
[32:21.500 --> 32:23.100]  Okay, Oche, base rookie.
[32:23.300 --> 32:24.540]  Here we go, Jalen Brown, base.
[32:24.560 --> 32:26.880]  As always, we collect and sleeve Celtics.
[32:27.940 --> 32:29.280]  Tyty Washington, junior.
[32:29.580 --> 32:30.260]  I believe he's a junior.
[32:30.380 --> 32:30.580]  Yeah.
[32:30.800 --> 32:31.340]  I like that name.
[32:31.400 --> 32:31.840]  Base rookie.
[32:32.160 --> 32:34.620]  And then, here we go, Luka by the numbers.
[32:35.480 --> 32:37.380]  Typically, I sleeve all Luka cards.
[32:37.480 --> 32:40.100]  But this is kind of a lame insert, so I don't think we'll bother with it.
[32:40.240 --> 32:40.560]  Ooh.
[32:41.920 --> 32:43.680]  Somebody in the chat maybe had a good idea.
[32:43.820 --> 32:44.040]  What's that?
[32:44.060 --> 32:44.880]  I can't believe I'm saying that.
[32:46.240 --> 32:48.340]  They said, what if we do the pack sack episode?
[32:48.860 --> 32:50.560]  And we do it, if we do Extra Life.
[32:51.220 --> 32:51.380]  Oh.
[32:51.520 --> 32:54.660]  If it's an Extra Life, we go through, we're draining the sack.
[32:54.820 --> 32:55.500]  Drain the sack.
[32:55.900 --> 32:57.480]  Yeah, we'll drain the sack at Extra Life.
[32:57.480 --> 33:01.340]  That sounds like a Dr. Pimple Popper type thing.
[33:01.460 --> 33:01.580]  Ew.
[33:01.780 --> 33:02.680]  I know, that's gross.
[33:02.720 --> 33:04.040]  Like, draining a sack.
[33:04.180 --> 33:04.360]  Yeah.
[33:04.920 --> 33:05.660]  That's cool, though.
[33:05.860 --> 33:08.960]  I try to watch pimple popping videos once every six months to see if it's like my thing.
[33:09.220 --> 33:11.140]  And then it's not my thing every time.
[33:11.260 --> 33:12.620]  And I go, nope, it's not my thing.
[33:12.620 --> 33:15.020]  I would watch, like, Autopsy and be fine.
[33:15.080 --> 33:16.520]  But like that, like...
[33:16.520 --> 33:19.820]  I think I have a new, I think I have a new collection for us.
[33:19.900 --> 33:21.060]  Based on this card right here.
[33:21.180 --> 33:21.320]  Okay?
[33:21.800 --> 33:23.840]  Here we have AJ Griffin, base rookie card.
[33:24.200 --> 33:25.780]  Showing us what appears to be his O-Face.
[33:26.760 --> 33:27.160]  Okay.
[33:27.940 --> 33:28.660]  So let's leave that.
[33:28.800 --> 33:29.260]  Collection sucks.
[33:29.680 --> 33:30.620]  Jalen Suggs.
[33:31.340 --> 33:32.700]  I like Suggs as a last name.
[33:32.780 --> 33:33.620]  It's fun to say.
[33:34.180 --> 33:36.760]  Tyler Hero, once again, most punchable face in the NBA.
[33:36.920 --> 33:37.600]  God, I hate him.
[33:37.600 --> 33:38.820]  He was being a little bitch today.
[33:39.640 --> 33:40.040]  No.
[33:40.180 --> 33:40.920]  Little bitch baby.
[33:40.920 --> 33:42.280]  And, oh, there we go.
[33:42.860 --> 33:44.360]  Dame Dalla, right there.
[33:44.900 --> 33:45.440]  Damian Lillard.
[33:45.680 --> 33:46.520]  That's the wrong jersey.
[33:46.640 --> 33:47.220]  Orange Shock Prism.
[33:47.360 --> 33:48.980]  Yeah, he's wearing the wrong jersey.
[33:49.080 --> 33:49.340]  Interesting.
[33:50.500 --> 33:52.700]  He's clearly the Milwaukee Buck, Damian Lillard.
[33:52.860 --> 33:53.300]  We'll leave that.
[33:54.560 --> 33:59.300]  Man, that's going to be the most terrifying pick and roll in all of basketball.
[33:59.440 --> 34:00.040]  Oh, it's going to be awesome.
[34:00.340 --> 34:00.720]  It's going to be terrible.
[34:00.980 --> 34:02.020]  What do you do?
[34:02.500 --> 34:03.400]  What do you do?
[34:04.480 --> 34:08.220]  Like, you just try to weather the storm until they don't play all the minutes.
[34:08.340 --> 34:09.140]  You try to outscore them.
[34:09.220 --> 34:09.400]  Yeah.
[34:09.400 --> 34:10.220]  That's it.
[34:10.220 --> 34:10.860]  That's essentially all you can do.
[34:11.280 --> 34:12.520]  Ah, this is a little heartbreaking.
[34:12.900 --> 34:14.120]  And I don't like the way it ended.
[34:14.460 --> 34:15.680]  Because there's clearly bad blood.
[34:16.140 --> 34:18.320]  Malcolm Brogdon, former rookie of the year.
[34:18.780 --> 34:20.200]  Former sixth man of the year.
[34:20.320 --> 34:21.720]  In the one year he was a Boston Celtic.
[34:21.760 --> 34:26.180]  We obviously dealt him to Portland in the whole Drew Holiday thing.
[34:26.320 --> 34:26.700]  Is he healthy?
[34:28.920 --> 34:29.280]  Supposedly.
[34:29.360 --> 34:30.240]  He's coming back healthy.
[34:30.760 --> 34:32.180]  He showed up in some trade rumors.
[34:32.400 --> 34:36.320]  And apparently that ruined, that soured his time with the Celtics.
[34:36.380 --> 34:37.640]  And he was like, get me the fuck out of here.
[34:37.800 --> 34:38.020]  Wow.
[34:38.020 --> 34:40.220]  This really sucks because he's a great guy.
[34:40.980 --> 34:42.820]  Phenomenal teammate from everything I've heard.
[34:43.160 --> 34:44.500]  And a really, really good player.
[34:44.760 --> 34:49.120]  The rub on him is that if he plays more than 20 to 25 minutes a game, he will break down.
[34:49.460 --> 34:51.440]  He's just made of glass for those dudes.
[34:51.700 --> 34:52.360]  I get it.
[34:52.520 --> 34:53.840]  That's why I don't play 40 minutes a game.
[34:53.920 --> 34:55.260]  If I play 25 minutes, I'm toast.
[34:55.460 --> 34:56.560]  Yeah, I'm on a minutes restriction.
[34:56.900 --> 34:57.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:59.300 --> 35:00.660]  Their restriction is zero.
[35:01.880 --> 35:03.160]  Ouzmane Diang, rookie.
[35:03.520 --> 35:04.120]  Julius Randall.
[35:04.720 --> 35:06.420]  Gonna be interesting to see how good the Knicks are this year.
[35:06.420 --> 35:09.500]  And then we have Prism, Pascal Siakam.
[35:09.600 --> 35:10.460]  We'll go ahead and sleeve that.
[35:10.840 --> 35:16.400]  Pascal Siakam got into it a little bit with Masai Uraji, the general manager today.
[35:16.560 --> 35:19.780]  Because Masai said the team played selfish last year.
[35:19.800 --> 35:21.160]  And he said, I never play selfish.
[35:21.260 --> 35:21.840]  How dare you?
[35:22.780 --> 35:23.760]  Starting out good.
[35:24.380 --> 35:25.360]  Yeah, they're off to a good start.
[35:26.920 --> 35:28.460]  Don't forget we're opening this basketball.
[35:28.980 --> 35:31.000]  Yeah, we're gonna open that in about 20 minutes.
[35:31.340 --> 35:32.660]  I'm excited for the basketball.
[35:33.260 --> 35:34.040]  Let's open up...
[35:34.040 --> 35:36.160]  Ooh, I know exactly what we can open up.
[35:37.160 --> 35:37.560]  Everybody...
[35:40.680 --> 35:41.980]  Everybody loves Dallas.
[35:43.620 --> 35:46.600]  It's the 40-year-old show that's taking the nation by storm.
[35:52.530 --> 35:57.190]  Bobby, currently I'm in the... towards the end of season six.
[35:57.390 --> 35:59.690]  And Bobby and Pamela are on the outs.
[36:00.070 --> 36:01.070]  Pamela's living in a hotel.
[36:01.250 --> 36:04.010]  She wants nothing to do with Bobby because he and J.R. are in this fight.
[36:05.330 --> 36:08.830]  When Jack died, he put it in his will that J.R. and Bobby have to...
[36:08.830 --> 36:09.650]  I gotta get a better view.
[36:09.790 --> 36:10.430]  They have one year.
[36:10.450 --> 36:11.230]  They have one year.
[36:11.350 --> 36:12.970]  They get 50% of the company each.
[36:13.070 --> 36:16.210]  And then they have to prove whether or not they can...
[36:16.210 --> 36:17.310]  or how much money they can make.
[36:17.410 --> 36:21.030]  And at the end of it, whoever gets it gets 1% extra and has control of Ewing North.
[36:21.050 --> 36:22.110]  Whoever makes the most money.
[36:22.110 --> 36:24.930]  So this is from earlier seasons when things are a little bit better.
[36:25.190 --> 36:27.890]  So all of that has nothing to do with what we're about to see.
[36:27.930 --> 36:30.650]  Although, what's that hair on Sue Allen?
[36:31.130 --> 36:32.770]  That's season two, Sue Allen, I think.
[36:32.770 --> 36:33.910]  Or is that Pamela?
[36:34.050 --> 36:36.750]  That's Pamela. That's Cliff Barnes and his sister Pamela.
[36:37.110 --> 36:38.510]  Pamela Ewing, you were just talking about.
[36:38.610 --> 36:39.730]  Yeah, she's married to Bobby.
[36:39.950 --> 36:43.590]  Cliff is the one who is always a day late and a dollar short.
[36:43.710 --> 36:46.170]  I don't fucking like Cliff. He's a user. I don't like him at all.
[36:46.210 --> 36:49.250]  He did. He was like the good guy who always tried to do good.
[36:49.330 --> 36:51.750]  And then it's just like... he got greedy.
[36:52.570 --> 36:55.450]  He's like Anakin Skywalker. He got poisoned by the dark side.
[36:55.830 --> 36:57.330]  And he watched a good dude turn to shit.
[36:57.730 --> 36:58.890]  Alright, card number two.
[36:59.030 --> 37:00.130]  There we go. That's Miss Ellie.
[37:00.330 --> 37:01.050]  That's Miss Ellie.
[37:01.390 --> 37:02.430]  That's Sue Allen.
[37:02.430 --> 37:03.570]  Sue Allen, Justice 4 in the back.
[37:03.630 --> 37:04.330]  And then there's J.R.
[37:04.430 --> 37:05.110]  There's J.R., yeah.
[37:05.350 --> 37:08.650]  I think that that might be at the trial that Jock was on or something.
[37:08.830 --> 37:10.110]  When you guys are done with this, are you watching Dynasty?
[37:10.610 --> 37:11.150]  No, I think...
[37:11.150 --> 37:13.310]  Maybe. Well, we're gonna watch Columbo, but then...
[37:13.310 --> 37:14.470]  I'm interested in trying that.
[37:14.710 --> 37:16.530]  Dynasty, I found, it's the same show, just in Colorado.
[37:17.030 --> 37:17.730]  That's the only difference.
[37:17.810 --> 37:18.590]  There aren't even oil people.
[37:18.690 --> 37:18.930]  Wild.
[37:20.390 --> 37:23.130]  Here we have Ray Krebs and Jock.
[37:23.310 --> 37:26.290]  Now, Ray, it turns out, is Jock's illegitimate son.
[37:26.450 --> 37:28.110]  We find that out in season three, I believe.
[37:28.170 --> 37:29.750]  He's been the ranch hand.
[37:29.750 --> 37:31.810]  And Ray is the one who would sleep with Lucy.
[37:32.390 --> 37:33.770]  And it's because Lucy didn't want to go to school.
[37:33.910 --> 37:36.310]  So she could, like, seduce Ray to, like,
[37:36.370 --> 37:38.170]  don't take me to school, I'll sleep with you.
[37:38.270 --> 37:39.770]  And she was underage. Problematic.
[37:39.870 --> 37:40.790]  Different time, different time.
[37:41.110 --> 37:41.950]  And they turned out to be related.
[37:41.990 --> 37:44.510]  And then they turned out to be, like, half uncle.
[37:44.830 --> 37:46.610]  Yeah, and then the show just dropped that.
[37:46.830 --> 37:48.670]  They don't ever mention it again.
[37:48.790 --> 37:50.050]  They're like, that was a season one problem.
[37:50.170 --> 37:51.750]  And then that's Jock, and he's dead now.
[37:51.830 --> 37:54.970]  He died in a helicopter crash because he was teaching the people
[37:54.970 --> 37:56.790]  in South America about drilling oil.
[37:57.030 --> 37:57.330]  Yeah.
[37:57.830 --> 38:00.590]  What really happened is he got brain cancer and died.
[38:00.650 --> 38:01.570]  Yeah, it was really sad.
[38:01.570 --> 38:01.850]  Yeah, between seasons.
[38:03.070 --> 38:03.870]  There's Pamela.
[38:04.050 --> 38:04.510]  There's Pamela.
[38:04.610 --> 38:06.110]  There's the season that she ruined her hair.
[38:06.750 --> 38:09.910]  It's fine in this photo, but it was real dramatic.
[38:10.230 --> 38:11.350]  She had such beautiful hair before.
[38:11.430 --> 38:12.550]  And then she permed that.
[38:13.510 --> 38:14.470]  That's the 80s, baby.
[38:14.650 --> 38:16.430]  Here we have Bobby and J.R. doing work.
[38:16.550 --> 38:17.410]  That's the old office.
[38:17.670 --> 38:18.750]  There's a photo of Sue Ellen.
[38:19.790 --> 38:22.350]  And he cheats on her in front of that photo.
[38:22.490 --> 38:23.470]  Like a little piece of shit.
[38:23.750 --> 38:26.510]  Yeah, and Sue Ellen was 1967 Miss Texas, too.
[38:26.510 --> 38:27.090]  Wow.
[38:27.470 --> 38:28.590]  That's how she got him.
[38:29.030 --> 38:29.270]  That's true.
[38:29.590 --> 38:31.250]  Here's a cool picture of Bobby.
[38:32.550 --> 38:34.210]  He's still a bitch, though.
[38:34.390 --> 38:35.410]  He's such a bitch.
[38:35.410 --> 38:36.210]  He's turning into a bitch.
[38:36.250 --> 38:36.930]  He's such a bitch.
[38:37.030 --> 38:39.270]  And then there is Miss Ellie again.
[38:39.730 --> 38:40.410]  She's looking away.
[38:41.410 --> 38:43.150]  Jacques, I love South Fork.
[38:43.710 --> 38:44.610]  Yeah, that's what she says.
[38:44.790 --> 38:48.650]  And she has that, couldn't be considered southern accent,
[38:48.790 --> 38:51.690]  but somehow she grew up in, she had that transatlantic accent.
[38:51.850 --> 38:53.050]  Somehow she grew up her entire life in Dallas.
[38:53.190 --> 38:54.550]  The back of it makes a poster.
[38:54.550 --> 38:56.550]  So I need to gather all of our...
[38:57.070 --> 38:59.710]  We'll try to put the poster together and we'll frame it on the wall.
[39:00.050 --> 39:01.150]  So, you know.
[39:02.570 --> 39:04.050]  How about some fucking NBA?
[39:04.430 --> 39:05.550]  Let's do a little bit of...
[39:06.090 --> 39:06.890]  I'm excited.
[39:07.490 --> 39:13.230]  If you're not a big NBA or sports fan, then you might not know that the NBA season technically starts today.
[39:13.730 --> 39:17.050]  Today's media day and then the preseason games will start rolling out.
[39:17.190 --> 39:21.250]  And then I think the Celtics opening game is the 22nd, maybe?
[39:22.210 --> 39:27.470]  But these are... 21-22, so last year's Panini, Optic...
[39:28.070 --> 39:30.210]  Who are we looking for the most last year?
[39:30.830 --> 39:35.250]  We'd probably be looking for Scottie Barnes or...
[39:35.930 --> 39:36.150]  Cade?
[39:36.730 --> 39:41.710]  No, that wouldn't be the Cade here. It'd be Scottie Barnes or Evan Mobley, probably.
[39:42.310 --> 39:46.750]  Matisse Taibel, base. Jalen Suggs, rookie. That was his rookie year.
[39:46.770 --> 39:48.470]  He kind of is a dud, but we'll sleeve it anyway.
[39:48.470 --> 39:51.470]  Bam Adebayo, Miles McBride...
[39:52.310 --> 39:53.870]  He's like, this is my little ball.
[39:54.650 --> 39:57.030]  That's my little baseball. Or basketball.
[39:58.010 --> 39:58.670]  Let's leave that.
[39:59.070 --> 39:59.950]  Zach Levine.
[40:00.010 --> 40:00.790]  He's a shy boy.
[40:01.410 --> 40:03.990]  Kelly Olenek. We know him as Maple Dick.
[40:04.410 --> 40:04.770]  Why?
[40:04.950 --> 40:06.150]  That's what they call him. He's from Canada.
[40:07.070 --> 40:09.810]  He played for the Celtics for six years. We drafted him, I think.
[40:10.510 --> 40:14.190]  RJ Barrett, Brian Forbes. I don't even know if he's in the NBA still.
[40:14.970 --> 40:17.190]  Here we got a Kawhi, 75 years of the NBA.
[40:18.130 --> 40:19.710]  Happy 75th anniversary, Kawhi.
[40:19.910 --> 40:21.190]  That's crazy he's played that long.
[40:21.370 --> 40:22.470]  It's nuts, and he's made of glass.
[40:22.710 --> 40:24.750]  Trey Young, my house. Apparently it's his house.
[40:25.990 --> 40:29.950]  Jonas Valentinus. I don't know what the name of the parallel is, but it's the checkerboard one.
[40:30.090 --> 40:30.650]  It's pretty pretty.
[40:30.790 --> 40:31.250]  I like that.
[40:31.650 --> 40:35.390]  Jonas is a good player. He would have been a lot more effective in the NBA 15 years ago.
[40:35.810 --> 40:37.190]  Ben Simmons...
[40:37.810 --> 40:39.570]  When would he have been effective in the NBA?
[40:41.010 --> 40:42.490]  Before he lost his mind.
[40:43.770 --> 40:45.990]  Is he still struggling?
[40:47.010 --> 40:48.710]  Well, we'll see. This is the year we find out.
[40:48.850 --> 40:50.050]  This is the year we find out.
[40:50.170 --> 40:50.570]  Now that's a real hit.
[40:50.570 --> 40:51.350]  Here we got the Scotty Barnes.
[40:52.970 --> 40:57.450]  Now, Scotty fell off a little bit in year two, but he's hopefully going to have a return to form in year three.
[40:57.850 --> 40:59.910]  Year three is usually when players make their big leap.
[41:00.090 --> 41:04.390]  So let's hope Scotty makes a leap, and then this card could be worth, I don't know, 50, 100 bucks.
[41:04.570 --> 41:04.810]  Nice.
[41:05.890 --> 41:06.690]  Not right now, though.
[41:06.950 --> 41:07.770]  Who does he play for?
[41:08.050 --> 41:11.210]  He plays for the Toronto Raptors, the team that played Selfish Basketball last year.
[41:11.210 --> 41:13.530]  Is that who our Grady Dick plays for?
[41:14.490 --> 41:15.190]  Yeah, I believe so.
[41:15.750 --> 41:16.550]  Raptors fans.
[41:16.650 --> 41:21.170]  Ben Simmons, grateful to be healthy, wants to be Nets point guard and leader.
[41:21.750 --> 41:24.390]  He wants to be the leader of that team.
[41:24.470 --> 41:25.430]  Who else would be the leader?
[41:25.730 --> 41:26.390]  Of that team?
[41:29.690 --> 41:31.170]  Cam Thomas? I mean, I don't know.
[41:32.150 --> 41:34.650]  Maybe he's the leader, because no one else is. Everyone else left.
[41:34.770 --> 41:40.930]  I just don't know if Ben Simmons is the guy who, after the last few years, you put all your trust on his back.
[41:40.950 --> 41:41.290]  Or any.
[41:41.890 --> 41:43.850]  He's really good at passing the ball.
[41:43.850 --> 41:46.070]  He's really good at passing the buck.
[41:46.070 --> 41:48.790]  He doesn't want it.
[41:52.450 --> 41:54.170]  What if we open up a little...
[41:54.170 --> 41:55.670]  Is it raining at Sloppy Joe's?
[41:56.250 --> 41:56.930]  It is.
[41:56.930 --> 41:58.210]  Oh, it is. It's raining at Sloppy Joe's.
[41:58.230 --> 42:01.010]  And everyone's looking. There's a woman who just blew kisses at the camera.
[42:01.030 --> 42:01.930]  I'm acknowledging the camera.
[42:02.170 --> 42:02.470]  Hi.
[42:03.030 --> 42:06.930]  I'm going to open up two packs of season six Game of Thrones.
[42:07.370 --> 42:09.710]  Oh, the best season? All right.
[42:10.590 --> 42:12.110]  Let's see what we have in here.
[42:12.110 --> 42:14.250]  As these, we're always looking for...
[42:14.250 --> 42:15.990]  Who is it we wanted? A Hodor autograph?
[42:16.010 --> 42:19.270]  Yeah, we want Hodor on card auto.
[42:19.350 --> 42:19.570]  Yeah.
[42:19.850 --> 42:21.270]  Cracked ice parallel.
[42:23.050 --> 42:23.930]  Nymeria Sand.
[42:24.350 --> 42:25.110]  Here we have...
[42:26.490 --> 42:29.330]  Here we have Lady Crane.
[42:30.150 --> 42:32.070]  All my favorite season six characters.
[42:32.450 --> 42:33.110]  Got the foil...
[42:33.790 --> 42:34.610]  Jaqen H'ghar.
[42:35.130 --> 42:36.870]  Oh, the face guy.
[42:37.390 --> 42:39.090]  The faceless man or whatever the fuck they call it.
[42:39.470 --> 42:41.010]  I read all these books and I don't remember any of this.
[42:41.570 --> 42:42.670]  Sir Jaime Lannister.
[42:42.870 --> 42:44.370]  I don't think they got this far in the books.
[42:44.550 --> 42:45.230]  Old one-hander.
[42:45.530 --> 42:45.610]  Yeah.
[42:45.890 --> 42:49.290]  And then one of the Sand Sisters, the Snake Sisters.
[42:51.590 --> 42:53.150]  Okay, we'll open up one more pack.
[42:53.230 --> 42:54.250]  Still hoping for that auto.
[42:54.670 --> 42:56.210]  Geoff saw a cool snake today.
[42:56.390 --> 42:57.810]  Like a cool snake on like a wall.
[42:57.970 --> 43:01.330]  And then told me that if you like snakes, that would be like the snake you would get.
[43:01.450 --> 43:03.510]  But I don't like snakes, so I couldn't like it.
[43:03.590 --> 43:07.850]  When you read the books, did you pronounce any of the names correctly in your head?
[43:08.070 --> 43:08.250]  Yeah.
[43:08.630 --> 43:08.870]  Really?
[43:08.870 --> 43:09.290]  Yeah.
[43:09.670 --> 43:10.550]  I'm real smart.
[43:11.170 --> 43:12.170]  Lord Varys.
[43:12.430 --> 43:13.870]  He's the one with all the little sparrows.
[43:14.510 --> 43:16.730]  Oh, we got a fucking Hodor green parallel.
[43:16.970 --> 43:17.470]  Wow.
[43:18.090 --> 43:18.650]  That's pretty cool.
[43:19.250 --> 43:20.630]  We'll sleeve that just because we love Hodor.
[43:20.890 --> 43:22.390]  We'll sleeve that.
[43:22.610 --> 43:23.670]  Bran Stark.
[43:24.730 --> 43:25.030]  Cool.
[43:26.510 --> 43:27.710]  Everyone's favorite character.
[43:27.930 --> 43:28.590]  King of the North.
[43:28.810 --> 43:29.650]  Meera Reed.
[43:29.910 --> 43:30.170]  Cool.
[43:31.570 --> 43:32.930]  Blood of my blood.
[43:33.310 --> 43:36.150]  That's Samwell Tully, it looks like, looking at his dad's sword.
[43:36.150 --> 43:38.850]  He's looking at his dad's sword and then he's gonna like take it.
[43:38.970 --> 43:40.790]  And there's the same card but a foil.
[43:44.530 --> 43:44.890]  Okay.
[43:46.410 --> 43:48.550]  You know what, let's play a little game now.
[43:48.770 --> 43:48.890]  Okay.
[43:49.130 --> 43:53.190]  Erik, Emily and I have conceived of a new game we want to play with you.
[43:53.350 --> 43:54.790]  This game is called Common Thread.
[43:54.990 --> 44:00.850]  You find a bunch of cards, in this case it's all basketball, but it could be all sports, it could be non-sports, it could be a mixture of stuff.
[44:00.850 --> 44:07.910]  And we try to, we look at these cards and we want you to figure out how these players relate to each other.
[44:07.970 --> 44:08.450]  Oh, interesting.
[44:08.570 --> 44:09.250]  Could be anything.
[44:09.410 --> 44:10.430]  I'm gonna throw these out here.
[44:10.510 --> 44:10.830]  Let's do it.
[44:10.890 --> 44:12.050]  And then we'll see what you think.
[44:12.190 --> 44:14.110]  Okay, I'm gonna start with...
[44:14.110 --> 44:14.510]  I don't know.
[44:14.530 --> 44:15.610]  Because I don't know who he is.
[44:16.530 --> 44:17.990]  I've never talked to him, I've never heard of him before.
[44:18.110 --> 44:18.870]  I don't think he's in the NBA anymore.
[44:18.930 --> 44:19.690]  Rasheed McCants.
[44:19.830 --> 44:20.070]  Okay.
[44:20.070 --> 44:21.210]  Okay, there's gonna be ten cards.
[44:21.410 --> 44:23.470]  And they all have a common thread.
[44:23.470 --> 44:23.850]  Okay.
[44:24.550 --> 44:25.270]  Rick Fox.
[44:25.830 --> 44:26.190]  Okay.
[44:26.990 --> 44:31.590]  Rick Fox, famous dude, played famously for a lot of teams, played for the Lakers.
[44:31.830 --> 44:31.990]  Yeah.
[44:33.970 --> 44:36.250]  Businessman as well, I don't want to get into, because that might be what it's about.
[44:36.510 --> 44:37.070]  Doesn't he...
[44:37.070 --> 44:37.150]  What?
[44:37.730 --> 44:37.970]  Oh.
[44:38.870 --> 44:42.570]  Tristan Thompson, everybody knows him, he's had a... well, he's been in the media a lot.
[44:42.930 --> 44:43.290]  Celtics?
[44:43.890 --> 44:45.990]  That is him as a Celtic, yeah, he briefly played for the Celtics.
[44:46.750 --> 44:47.650]  Here's Devin Booker.
[44:48.490 --> 44:48.750]  Okay.
[44:49.110 --> 44:51.330]  One of the best shooters in the NBA.
[44:51.830 --> 44:57.010]  Then we have Jordan Clarkson, who I think I'm the only person that doesn't like.
[44:57.450 --> 44:57.950]  Never been a fan.
[44:58.590 --> 45:02.330]  Here we have Blake Griffin in a Toposphere parallel.
[45:03.030 --> 45:05.550]  That's a really... insert, that's a really nice card.
[45:06.010 --> 45:06.690]  Really nice insert.
[45:06.790 --> 45:09.910]  Then we have, speaking of the devil, Ben Simmons, that's his base rookie card.
[45:09.950 --> 45:10.290]  There he is.
[45:10.310 --> 45:12.250]  That used to be worth something, not anymore.
[45:13.890 --> 45:14.910]  Someday again, maybe.
[45:15.710 --> 45:16.950]  Then we have Lamar Odom.
[45:17.350 --> 45:17.690]  Oh!
[45:17.910 --> 45:18.770]  Famous for a lot of things.
[45:18.810 --> 45:18.970]  Yeah.
[45:19.190 --> 45:20.690]  A lot of things, so it could be any of those things.
[45:21.710 --> 45:23.170]  Then we have James Harden.
[45:23.330 --> 45:23.690]  Okay.
[45:23.810 --> 45:24.910]  Also famous for a lot of things.
[45:25.010 --> 45:26.870]  And then we have, finally, Chris Humphries.
[45:27.290 --> 45:29.870]  That is, I got his on-card auto because it was $2.
[45:31.050 --> 45:33.250]  What do these 10 players have in common?
[45:33.310 --> 45:34.070]  I'll read them off for you.
[45:34.150 --> 45:40.070]  Ben Simmons, Jordan Clarkson, Devin Booker, an audience I want you to play along in the chat, but don't...
[45:40.070 --> 45:40.970]  Eric, I don't want you to look at the chat.
[45:40.990 --> 45:41.070]  Okay.
[45:41.110 --> 45:42.030]  I don't want you to get spoiled.
[45:42.290 --> 45:42.510]  You got it.
[45:42.510 --> 45:50.670]  Rashad McCants, Lamar Odom, the great Blake Griffin, the great Tristan Thompson, Rick Fox, James Harden, and...
[45:50.670 --> 45:51.410]  Chris Humphries.
[45:51.790 --> 45:54.030]  What is the common thread between these 10 players?
[45:54.210 --> 45:56.910]  Have they all appeared on Keeping Up with the Kardashians?
[45:57.250 --> 46:00.070]  I don't know if they've all appeared on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.
[46:00.170 --> 46:01.670]  But is that your common thread?
[46:01.830 --> 46:04.090]  That is what my guess for common thread would be.
[46:04.210 --> 46:05.590]  Is it Kardashian-related?
[46:06.070 --> 46:06.410]  Yes.
[46:06.910 --> 46:07.170]  Okay.
[46:07.550 --> 46:08.970]  Are we doing 20 questions with this?
[46:09.070 --> 46:11.270]  No, I had my guess.
[46:11.810 --> 46:12.190]  Potentially.
[46:12.370 --> 46:13.310]  What would that be?
[46:13.810 --> 46:15.530]  They all dated Kardashians?
[46:15.670 --> 46:16.910]  These men have all dated Kardashians.
[46:16.910 --> 46:22.030]  So the Rick Fox one made me think that it was going to be an esports thing.
[46:22.290 --> 46:22.330]  Yeah.
[46:22.610 --> 46:23.610]  That's what I was hoping for.
[46:23.690 --> 46:25.710]  I'm like, okay, we're going in that direction.
[46:25.990 --> 46:30.450]  What really got it was Odom and then Humphries.
[46:30.670 --> 46:30.810]  Yeah.
[46:30.970 --> 46:34.090]  I don't remember Ben Simmons dating any of the Kardashians.
[46:34.410 --> 46:36.130]  That's very, very funny to me.
[46:36.130 --> 46:37.030]  So here's what we have.
[46:37.030 --> 46:38.790]  They have all appeared on the Kardashians.
[46:41.790 --> 46:42.610]  Here's what we have.
[46:42.670 --> 46:44.530]  Lamar Odom dated Khloe, obviously.
[46:44.690 --> 46:45.610]  Married to Khloe.
[46:45.610 --> 46:47.510]  James Harden dated Khloe.
[46:47.750 --> 46:49.230]  Chris Humphries was married to Kim.
[46:49.630 --> 46:51.690]  Tristan Thompson was married to Khloe.
[46:52.230 --> 46:53.650]  And they have two kids together now?
[46:53.950 --> 46:54.370]  Tristan Thompson.
[46:54.530 --> 46:55.210]  She has two kids.
[46:55.310 --> 46:56.230]  One of them is named Tatum.
[46:56.710 --> 46:57.330]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[46:57.450 --> 46:59.430]  Which is interesting because he was playing for the Celtics when that happened.
[47:00.110 --> 47:03.090]  He cheated on her right before both births.
[47:03.190 --> 47:04.390]  With a lady from Texas.
[47:05.470 --> 47:06.750]  That's our connection here, Texas.
[47:07.130 --> 47:08.210]  Devin Booker dated Kendall.
[47:08.630 --> 47:09.330]  Kind of famously.
[47:09.510 --> 47:10.070]  That was kind of a big one.
[47:10.110 --> 47:12.090]  I didn't know Rick Fox and Khloe dated.
[47:12.150 --> 47:12.970]  That was a long time ago.
[47:13.330 --> 47:14.750]  Kendall briefly dated Blake Griffin.
[47:14.750 --> 47:15.590]  Wait, wait, wait.
[47:15.650 --> 47:16.510]  Before you keep going.
[47:16.770 --> 47:17.970]  Rick Fox and who?
[47:18.310 --> 47:18.430]  Kendall.
[47:18.630 --> 47:18.990]  Or Khloe.
[47:20.250 --> 47:20.650]  Khloe.
[47:20.670 --> 47:20.990]  Yeah.
[47:21.270 --> 47:22.150]  It was one of the first people.
[47:22.230 --> 47:23.350]  What's their age gap?
[47:23.470 --> 47:24.630]  Khloe's like our age.
[47:24.790 --> 47:25.390]  She's in her 40s.
[47:25.990 --> 47:26.350]  No.
[47:26.930 --> 47:27.170]  Is it?
[47:28.410 --> 47:31.190]  I thought Khloe was in her...
[47:31.190 --> 47:32.470]  Kim's in her 40s.
[47:32.650 --> 47:34.430]  How old is Rick Fox?
[47:35.410 --> 47:36.210]  Kardashian age.
[47:36.390 --> 47:36.710]  Hold on.
[47:37.130 --> 47:38.550]  I'm going to look up Rick Fox age.
[47:38.550 --> 47:39.610]  You look up Rick...
[47:39.610 --> 47:40.590]  You do that.
[47:40.630 --> 47:41.130]  I'll do this.
[47:41.190 --> 47:42.870]  I don't think they're...
[47:42.870 --> 47:44.150]  Am I wrong?
[47:47.130 --> 47:49.930]  Rick Fox is 54 years old.
[47:50.050 --> 47:50.450]  Okay.
[47:50.690 --> 47:51.090]  Okay.
[47:51.090 --> 47:52.150]  And Khloe is...
[47:52.990 --> 47:53.390]  38.
[47:53.950 --> 47:54.490]  I'm going to guess.
[47:54.650 --> 47:55.050]  39.
[47:55.610 --> 47:55.850]  Wow.
[47:56.110 --> 47:57.170]  So close enough.
[47:57.690 --> 47:58.350]  That is a...
[47:58.350 --> 47:58.990]  That's...
[47:58.990 --> 47:59.410]  15 years.
[47:59.670 --> 48:00.450]  15 years.
[48:00.830 --> 48:01.730]  I mean, it just...
[48:01.730 --> 48:02.210]  That's not who I would...
[48:02.210 --> 48:02.730]  In Hollywood?
[48:03.150 --> 48:03.330]  Yeah.
[48:03.470 --> 48:03.630]  Right.
[48:03.730 --> 48:04.550]  But that's not who I...
[48:04.550 --> 48:08.290]  Like, if you're like all the Kardashians, Rick Fox isn't who I would have been like...
[48:08.290 --> 48:08.990]  And with Khloe.
[48:09.210 --> 48:09.470]  Right.
[48:09.610 --> 48:11.890]  I would have thought like, oh, he dated Kris for a minute.
[48:12.150 --> 48:12.330]  Yeah.
[48:12.330 --> 48:14.350]  I would have thought Kris as well, but apparently not.
[48:14.850 --> 48:15.930]  Blake Griffin dated Kendall.
[48:16.050 --> 48:16.070]  Yeah.
[48:16.070 --> 48:16.670]  We said that.
[48:16.750 --> 48:17.730]  Ben Simmons dated Kendall.
[48:17.870 --> 48:18.010]  Yeah.
[48:18.110 --> 48:19.230]  Jordan Clarkson dated Kendall.
[48:19.690 --> 48:22.030]  Which is interesting, because I thought Kendall was...
[48:22.030 --> 48:22.990]  Ben is bicoastal, right?
[48:23.350 --> 48:23.770]  I don't know.
[48:23.790 --> 48:24.110]  Okay.
[48:24.170 --> 48:24.510]  We don't know that.
[48:24.530 --> 48:25.610]  She's with Bad Bunny right now.
[48:25.750 --> 48:26.310]  And then...
[48:26.310 --> 48:27.190]  Oh, that's right.
[48:27.250 --> 48:27.890]  She's with Bad Bunny.
[48:27.990 --> 48:28.710]  I'm happy for them.
[48:28.950 --> 48:30.930]  And then Rashad McCants dated Khloe.
[48:30.970 --> 48:32.570]  I think he was the first NBA player she dated.
[48:32.970 --> 48:33.170]  Wow.
[48:33.210 --> 48:33.710]  So there you go.
[48:33.730 --> 48:34.850]  That's the common thread.
[48:34.990 --> 48:37.690]  And so, Eric, every few weeks when we have one, we'll bring these.
[48:37.750 --> 48:38.610]  We'll submit them to you.
[48:38.850 --> 48:40.270]  And then you and the audience can play along.
[48:40.270 --> 48:41.410]  Have you dated a Kardashian?
[48:41.890 --> 48:42.550]  Pull the common thread.
[48:42.870 --> 48:43.190]  Interesting.
[48:43.710 --> 48:45.050]  Yeah, it was a lot of fun to put that together.
[48:45.350 --> 48:46.410]  And Emily and I have...
[48:46.410 --> 48:48.870]  Emily actually has a lot of really good ideas for where we can take this.
[48:48.970 --> 48:48.990]  That's great.
[48:48.990 --> 48:50.250]  Gracie, did you like the common thread?
[48:50.650 --> 48:51.010]  Loved it.
[48:51.110 --> 48:51.570]  Thank you.
[48:51.610 --> 48:52.010]  Great, great.
[48:52.010 --> 48:52.630]  Gracie loved it.
[48:52.870 --> 48:53.090]  Good.
[48:53.270 --> 48:54.010]  That makes me happy.
[48:54.150 --> 48:54.270]  Yeah.
[48:54.350 --> 48:56.430]  So now we're down to 11 minutes left.
[48:56.870 --> 48:57.350]  What if we...
[48:57.350 --> 48:57.610]  What if we...
[48:57.610 --> 48:57.850]  Basketball time.
[48:57.890 --> 49:01.130]  What if we broke open one of these boxes of Allen and Ginter...
[49:01.130 --> 49:01.610]  Let's do it.
[49:01.630 --> 49:03.270]  And see if we can get...
[49:03.270 --> 49:03.470]  A falcon.
[49:03.470 --> 49:04.270]  Let's do 2023.
[49:04.510 --> 49:05.370]  Let's see if we can get a falcon.
[49:05.550 --> 49:06.110]  Or a topper.
[49:06.110 --> 49:07.110]  Let's see if we can get a...
[49:07.690 --> 49:10.050]  We're desperate to replace our break...
[49:10.050 --> 49:10.450]  A topper, falcon.
[49:10.450 --> 49:10.990]  Our rip card.
[49:11.390 --> 49:13.630]  Or maybe we'll get lucky and get a jet ski.
[49:13.770 --> 49:13.990]  Yes.
[49:14.630 --> 49:15.350]  That would be good too.
[49:15.450 --> 49:16.110]  And then a basketball.
[49:16.590 --> 49:16.770]  Yeah.
[49:17.010 --> 49:17.970]  And then we'll open up the basketball.
[49:18.610 --> 49:21.970]  And then you'll have to come back next week and we'll open up one of these other fantastic
[49:21.970 --> 49:22.390]  boxes.
[49:22.510 --> 49:23.290]  There's a lot going on.
[49:23.510 --> 49:23.790]  A lot going on.
[49:23.790 --> 49:25.150]  There's a lot going on in the break show, baby.
[49:25.470 --> 49:26.190]  A lot going on.
[49:26.770 --> 49:28.110]  We're trying to grow this break show.
[49:28.350 --> 49:30.630]  Well, you gotta talk about it on any of your other productions.
[49:30.790 --> 49:31.270]  That'd be nice.
[49:31.390 --> 49:32.150]  I pitched...
[49:32.150 --> 49:33.550]  I pumped it today in Anima.
[49:33.790 --> 49:34.250]  You did a good job.
[49:34.250 --> 49:34.270]  Good.
[49:34.290 --> 49:35.090]  Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[49:36.210 --> 49:36.530]  Ooh.
[49:36.730 --> 49:37.490]  There's our rip card.
[49:37.650 --> 49:38.210]  And then we'll do this.
[49:38.290 --> 49:39.910]  And then let's put one of these bad boys...
[49:39.910 --> 49:42.170]  I'd like to touch it to see if I could feel if it's like...
[49:42.170 --> 49:42.770]  We'll put one of these...
[49:42.770 --> 49:44.130]  Would it be thicker than the other ones?
[49:44.530 --> 49:45.090]  Yeah, probably.
[49:45.110 --> 49:45.570]  Eh, I think that's...
[49:45.570 --> 49:47.110]  We'll put one of these bad boys in the...
[49:47.530 --> 49:49.730]  Oh, interesting thing I learned about Alan and Ginter...
[49:49.730 --> 49:49.890]  Yeah.
[49:50.170 --> 49:51.390]  ...that I did not know...
[49:51.390 --> 49:51.670]  Mm-hmm.
[49:53.190 --> 49:54.890]  ...I've obviously been collecting them for a long time.
[49:54.950 --> 49:55.030]  Yeah.
[49:55.030 --> 49:55.570]  I'm a big fan.
[49:55.610 --> 49:56.930]  Let's just open this fucker up and see what it is.
[49:56.930 --> 49:57.990]  That's what I'm talking about.
[49:58.930 --> 50:03.910]  Alan and Ginter has a thing that I don't think any other brand has.
[50:03.910 --> 50:04.910]  They have in one...
[50:06.210 --> 50:06.530]  Oh.
[50:06.710 --> 50:07.410]  Is it a rip card?
[50:07.790 --> 50:08.070]  No.
[50:08.210 --> 50:08.510]  Oh.
[50:09.170 --> 50:11.430]  One out of every...
[50:11.990 --> 50:14.310]  One box out of every case is called a hot box.
[50:14.450 --> 50:14.630]  Uh-huh.
[50:14.770 --> 50:15.870]  And that hot box, every pack...
[50:15.870 --> 50:16.750]  Not the Disney hot box.
[50:16.750 --> 50:17.170]  Oh, okay.
[50:17.170 --> 50:17.970]  Not the Mickey Mouse.
[50:18.010 --> 50:18.410]  I was gonna say, I don't know...
[50:18.410 --> 50:19.650]  It's not a Mickey Mouse drug-related thing.
[50:19.650 --> 50:20.290]  I was confused.
[50:20.430 --> 50:20.910]  I got it.
[50:21.490 --> 50:21.810]  It's...
[50:21.810 --> 50:24.850]  Every card in the box is foil.
[50:25.290 --> 50:26.050]  Oh, that's cool.
[50:26.090 --> 50:26.510]  That's really cool.
[50:26.570 --> 50:27.570]  You get a whole foil box.
[50:27.590 --> 50:27.690]  Yeah.
[50:27.690 --> 50:28.250]  I didn't know they did that.
[50:28.470 --> 50:29.650]  So this is Clayton Kershaw.
[50:29.870 --> 50:31.230]  Oversized Kershaw, worth anything or no?
[50:31.230 --> 50:33.550]  He's probably gonna be retiring here, it sounds like.
[50:33.630 --> 50:34.170]  This season.
[50:34.290 --> 50:35.350]  No, he'll play one more.
[50:35.350 --> 50:38.270]  I think this might be a parallel of some kind,
[50:38.330 --> 50:40.090]  because I've never seen them come in red like this.
[50:40.090 --> 50:41.290]  I'll have to look into that.
[50:41.810 --> 50:43.450]  You really don't think he's gonna go one more season?
[50:43.730 --> 50:44.450]  You think he's done?
[50:44.690 --> 50:46.490]  They made the playoffs, they won 100 games,
[50:46.550 --> 50:47.630]  and you think he's going, eh, that's it?
[50:47.750 --> 50:48.430]  I think after...
[50:48.430 --> 50:50.390]  I think he's gonna win a championship this year
[50:50.390 --> 50:50.830]  and then retire.
[50:50.950 --> 50:52.170]  I mean, they're not gonna win the championship,
[50:52.470 --> 50:53.410]  so I guess you'll have to...
[50:53.410 --> 50:53.810]  Who's gonna beat him?
[50:54.470 --> 50:55.210]  Probably the Astros.
[50:55.690 --> 50:55.930]  Yeah.
[50:56.850 --> 50:57.810]  Fucking Astros, man.
[50:57.850 --> 50:57.950]  Yeah.
[50:59.350 --> 51:00.950]  But, you know, who is probably retiring?
[51:00.950 --> 51:03.130]  I mean, Miguel Cabrera is retiring.
[51:03.450 --> 51:03.570]  Yeah.
[51:03.690 --> 51:04.590]  He played the last game.
[51:05.230 --> 51:08.010]  He hasn't confirmed it, but Zach Granke.
[51:08.330 --> 51:08.850]  Really?
[51:08.990 --> 51:09.330]  Yep.
[51:09.710 --> 51:11.690]  This was his last hurrah.
[51:11.930 --> 51:12.450]  You sad about that?
[51:12.730 --> 51:14.470]  Yeah, I love a weirdo baseball.
[51:14.570 --> 51:16.070]  Not enough weirdos in baseball.
[51:16.170 --> 51:17.370]  Zach Granke, classic weirdo.
[51:17.650 --> 51:18.670]  We just got a fucking hit.
[51:18.910 --> 51:19.430]  Really?
[51:19.690 --> 51:19.910]  Yeah.
[51:20.030 --> 51:21.150]  Okay, let's get through this.
[51:21.590 --> 51:22.310]  It's a Falcon!
[51:22.730 --> 51:23.910]  First card, Eloy Jimenez.
[51:24.290 --> 51:24.590]  Alright.
[51:24.870 --> 51:27.430]  Second card, Victor Wiminyama.
[51:27.490 --> 51:27.670]  Okay.
[51:27.750 --> 51:28.510]  Hey, Wimby!
[51:29.190 --> 51:29.710]  That's...
[51:29.710 --> 51:31.310]  That might be worth something.
[51:31.490 --> 51:32.350]  I don't know how much that's worth.
[51:32.430 --> 51:33.350]  Can we look that up?
[51:33.630 --> 51:35.690]  Victor Wiminyama, base, Allen and Ginter.
[51:35.830 --> 51:36.790]  Let's go ahead and sleeve that.
[51:36.870 --> 51:38.290]  It's probably worth $20 or $30, though.
[51:39.210 --> 51:40.790]  Here we have Jover Peguero.
[51:40.910 --> 51:41.950]  We'll sleeve that.
[51:42.950 --> 51:43.850]  And we got old Bintliff.
[51:44.450 --> 51:45.670]  Let's find out who the fuck that is.
[51:46.490 --> 51:47.210]  Jim Bintliff.
[51:48.570 --> 51:49.850]  Oh, this is the mud dude!
[51:50.590 --> 51:50.950]  Okay.
[51:51.670 --> 51:55.410]  Jim Bintliff is the guy that provides all the mud that they use to scuff up baseball.
[51:55.470 --> 51:57.130]  I read a New York Times article about him.
[51:57.410 --> 51:57.530]  Yeah, there you go.
[51:57.550 --> 51:59.030]  He knows where... it's a secret spot.
[51:59.030 --> 52:00.870]  Yeah, he's the only person in the world.
[52:01.050 --> 52:01.490]  It's base?
[52:01.910 --> 52:02.630]  Yeah, it's base.
[52:02.750 --> 52:03.450]  I see $20 on eBay.
[52:03.510 --> 52:03.650]  $20.
[52:03.930 --> 52:05.570]  That's not bad for...
[52:05.570 --> 52:07.730]  I should probably sell that, because it won't maintain that value.
[52:08.890 --> 52:10.870]  We got a base rookie, Nolan Gorman.
[52:11.330 --> 52:11.990]  Sleeve that.
[52:12.170 --> 52:12.290]  Cool.
[52:12.410 --> 52:14.770]  We got a base rookie for Garrett Mitchell.
[52:15.030 --> 52:16.010]  Go ahead and sleeve that.
[52:16.590 --> 52:16.950]  Ooh!
[52:17.110 --> 52:19.030]  Our mini card is...
[52:20.990 --> 52:21.430]  Historic...
[52:21.430 --> 52:22.170]  The...
[52:22.170 --> 52:26.270]  Lancey Awe Meadows National Historic Park in Canada.
[52:26.450 --> 52:27.570]  The fuck are these cards?
[52:27.570 --> 52:30.050]  I still don't know why you don't have a card.
[52:30.150 --> 52:30.250]  Ooh!
[52:30.410 --> 52:31.590]  Here's Eloy Jimenez.
[52:31.770 --> 52:32.310]  We got a loot.
[52:32.850 --> 52:33.950]  It's music to your ears.
[52:34.150 --> 52:34.550]  Hey!
[52:35.490 --> 52:36.010]  There you go.
[52:36.130 --> 52:36.790]  We'll sleeve the loot.
[52:38.850 --> 52:40.530]  I love the weird stuff.
[52:40.690 --> 52:42.930]  We need to talk to Alan or Ginter.
[52:42.990 --> 52:43.690]  Yeah, get them talking.
[52:44.070 --> 52:45.710]  And get Geoffy a card.
[52:45.970 --> 52:47.230]  I don't see why he's...
[52:47.230 --> 52:49.550]  Why does the TikTok guy have a...
[52:49.550 --> 52:50.130]  I mean, because he has a bazillion...
[52:50.130 --> 52:50.830]  What is the mud guy?
[52:51.310 --> 52:52.010]  Christian Yellich.
[52:52.030 --> 52:52.450]  What is the mud guy?
[52:53.010 --> 52:54.750]  Why does a loot have it and not you?
[52:55.710 --> 52:56.510]  Alec Minoa.
[52:56.950 --> 52:58.930]  Showing off his fucking arm tattoo.
[52:59.070 --> 52:59.850]  That's my name.
[53:01.150 --> 53:02.090]  So he doesn't forget.
[53:05.210 --> 53:07.810]  I saw Pete Davidson was on Howard Stern once.
[53:08.390 --> 53:11.150]  And Howard was interviewing about his time at SNL and the tattoos and stuff.
[53:11.190 --> 53:12.610]  And he was like, you got all these tattoos.
[53:12.830 --> 53:14.370]  Doesn't that fuck up sketches and stuff?
[53:14.950 --> 53:16.090]  Was Lauren okay with that?
[53:16.110 --> 53:18.330]  And he goes, Lauren actually talked to me one day about it.
[53:18.350 --> 53:21.530]  And he said, so you've got a wolf on your arm.
[53:21.590 --> 53:23.510]  Are you afraid you'll forget what a wolf looks like?
[53:23.510 --> 53:25.130]  I don't know, that's fucking awesome.
[53:26.510 --> 53:28.670]  D.L. Hall, bass rookie, will sleeve that.
[53:29.170 --> 53:31.670]  Ooh, isn't this one of those...
[53:31.670 --> 53:34.110]  Does anybody know who Miles Montplaisir is?
[53:34.250 --> 53:38.190]  He is a content creator and podcaster from Fargo, North Dakota.
[53:38.190 --> 53:39.130]  Oh, it's that guy!
[53:39.370 --> 53:41.890]  Yeah, he does like the...
[53:41.890 --> 53:43.510]  He's like a Midwest guy.
[53:44.290 --> 53:44.730]  That's his...
[53:44.730 --> 53:45.230]  That's all...
[53:45.230 --> 53:49.390]  I mean, honestly, if you saw any of his content, I fucking nailed it.
[53:50.470 --> 53:52.150]  You betcha has at it, yeah.
[53:52.150 --> 53:54.330]  Matt Chapman, bass.
[53:54.830 --> 53:57.170]  Then we have the...
[53:57.170 --> 53:58.310]  Ooh, fucking...
[53:58.310 --> 54:00.310]  One of the coolest dudes in the history of baseball.
[54:00.550 --> 54:00.930]  Ichiro.
[54:01.650 --> 54:02.530]  Ichiro Suzuki.
[54:02.670 --> 54:04.630]  For some reason, with Miami.
[54:05.350 --> 54:06.250]  With Miami and not Minnesota.
[54:06.490 --> 54:07.210]  Or not, sorry, Minnesota.
[54:07.590 --> 54:07.950]  Seattle.
[54:09.190 --> 54:10.730]  Or the Yankees for some reason.
[54:10.990 --> 54:12.380]  Here we have Dontrell Willis.
[54:13.290 --> 54:14.750]  That's nice, we'll sleeve that.
[54:14.810 --> 54:15.810]  That's an old school Marlon.
[54:16.070 --> 54:20.490]  And then we have a Clayton Kershaw, 41.2 consecutive scoreless innings.
[54:20.490 --> 54:20.890]  Oh, that's cool.
[54:20.890 --> 54:21.550]  Same as that guy.
[54:21.850 --> 54:22.570]  The big guy.
[54:22.890 --> 54:24.050]  Yeah, that's the same dude.
[54:24.310 --> 54:25.130]  Same as the big guy.
[54:25.210 --> 54:26.270]  Same as the big guy.
[54:26.630 --> 54:27.670]  We got about six minutes left.
[54:27.730 --> 54:30.150]  Alright, let's open up this one pack and then we'll crack into this basketball.
[54:30.950 --> 54:33.290]  That'll be a day, we'll call it a day.
[54:33.390 --> 54:33.870]  I like it.
[54:33.970 --> 54:37.230]  Good day, we got a $500 rookie auto we'll have to look into.
[54:38.170 --> 54:41.110]  We'll get into more fan mail, we'll get into more of our other stuff.
[54:41.170 --> 54:43.570]  We just got excited about the amount of things that we have here.
[54:43.610 --> 54:47.590]  Yeah, because we waited a week and I buy stuff every week, I just wanted to show it all off.
[54:47.770 --> 54:49.450]  So we'll definitely get back to fan mail next week.
[54:49.450 --> 54:52.110]  First car, Crystal Reed, she's an actress.
[54:52.750 --> 54:53.870]  Do you know what Crystal's been in?
[54:54.050 --> 54:55.690]  What does it say on the back of the card, maybe?
[54:56.510 --> 55:02.350]  Her breakout came in 2011 with her portrayal of Allison Argent in the MTV series Teen Wolf.
[55:02.590 --> 55:06.530]  A role that earned her multiple nominations at the Teen Choice Awards.
[55:07.050 --> 55:09.350]  Born and raised in Detroit, that's us.
[55:10.290 --> 55:14.390]  Crystal studied dance as a youngster before becoming active in local community theaters.
[55:14.390 --> 55:20.470]  She's appeared in eight films, with the latest, Teen Wolf the Movie, released on Paramount January 2023.
[55:20.670 --> 55:23.610]  I'm gonna get Paramount Plus to watch her in Teen Wolf the Movie.
[55:23.910 --> 55:28.590]  Teen Wolf is not the property from my childhood I thought would get rebooted as a serious thing.
[55:28.890 --> 55:30.250]  It's like Twilight.
[55:30.570 --> 55:32.150]  They just made it Twilight.
[55:32.330 --> 55:32.850]  They just made it Twilight.
[55:33.090 --> 55:33.870]  Why Teen Wolf?
[55:34.050 --> 55:35.150]  I think it's just the name.
[55:35.390 --> 55:40.650]  I think they went, this is a show that kids will easily know, this is about teens and wolves.
[55:42.190 --> 55:44.410]  We got Drew Waters, bass rookie, we'll sleeve that.
[55:44.530 --> 55:45.090]  Can you sleeve these too?
[55:45.270 --> 55:45.850]  Thank you.
[55:45.870 --> 55:47.930]  And then we have Mark Ventos.
[55:48.070 --> 55:48.990]  I'm just saying thank you.
[55:49.050 --> 55:49.270]  I know.
[55:49.430 --> 55:50.950]  Oh, that's a fucking great one.
[55:53.610 --> 55:54.530]  This is good too.
[55:54.850 --> 55:56.950]  Anthony Richardson, football card.
[55:57.070 --> 55:58.250]  I think these are worth a little bit.
[55:58.310 --> 55:59.550]  Let's sleeve this, I'll look it up.
[56:00.550 --> 56:04.610]  Speaking of football players, here's high school running back Bella Rasmussen.
[56:05.190 --> 56:06.530]  Now this I think...
[56:06.530 --> 56:06.750]  What?
[56:06.950 --> 56:07.510]  Is that the female?
[56:08.690 --> 56:10.050]  High school running back?
[56:10.050 --> 56:15.490]  Yeah, she twice made history in 2022 as the first female high school football player to score two touchdowns in a game,
[56:15.610 --> 56:19.670]  as well as the first to sign a name, image, and likeness deal.
[56:20.330 --> 56:25.770]  These feats earned her acclaim as she made appearances on national TV shows Access Hollywood and The Today Show.
[56:26.130 --> 56:29.750]  A varsity athlete for two years, Rasmussen left the door open to continue her playing career in college.
[56:29.990 --> 56:30.330]  Awesome.
[56:31.090 --> 56:31.450]  There we go.
[56:31.550 --> 56:32.450]  She should be on Teen Wolf.
[56:32.770 --> 56:32.970]  Yeah.
[56:33.250 --> 56:36.150]  Had an extra bad year, but still loved Tim Anderson.
[56:36.330 --> 56:38.050]  Yeah, he had an extra...
[56:38.050 --> 56:38.950]  Glass jaw.
[56:39.230 --> 56:42.630]  Him standing up to fight and then getting knocked down.
[56:43.250 --> 56:45.250]  Going down with his fists up like it's UFC.
[56:45.890 --> 56:46.290]  Hilarious.
[56:46.630 --> 56:48.810]  Now, we have two hits here.
[56:48.930 --> 56:49.130]  Okay.
[56:49.250 --> 56:50.170]  We want to open a good...
[56:50.670 --> 56:51.710]  We're running out of time, we'll do it.
[56:53.030 --> 56:53.770]  Jet ski!
[56:57.070 --> 56:58.750]  How the fuck did we get that?
[56:58.870 --> 56:59.890]  How awesome is that?
[57:00.490 --> 57:01.670]  Send it out to PSA.
[57:01.870 --> 57:03.030]  We'll send it off to get it graded.
[57:03.390 --> 57:05.530]  As a matter of fact, why don't you just put that in...
[57:05.530 --> 57:07.490]  Oh my god, that's...
[57:07.490 --> 57:08.870]  That is...
[57:09.350 --> 57:10.770]  Sleeve it and then put it in the car seat.
[57:10.830 --> 57:12.950]  Oh my god, I gotta get this graded.
[57:12.990 --> 57:13.770]  Very cool.
[57:14.750 --> 57:20.050]  And then, while we're at it, another huge star of reality TV, Tom Sandoval!
[57:20.210 --> 57:20.590]  Boo!
[57:22.610 --> 57:23.050]  Boo!
[57:24.550 --> 57:26.690]  Everybody's least favorite person, Tom Sandoval.
[57:26.870 --> 57:28.910]  They put him on an Alan and Ginter card?
[57:28.990 --> 57:29.910]  He gets all you gotta do.
[57:29.930 --> 57:32.170]  So he gets a card and you don't.
[57:32.310 --> 57:32.690]  You couldn't...
[57:33.230 --> 57:35.450]  Get Alan or Ginter on the phone, I'm ready.
[57:35.470 --> 57:36.870]  We should PSA grade Sandoval.
[57:36.870 --> 57:38.510]  I don't have a cover band, what do you want from me?
[57:38.850 --> 57:41.870]  I mean, to be fair, so does he hardly.
[57:43.190 --> 57:44.970]  You can pay anybody to do anything.
[57:45.110 --> 57:46.730]  Alright, should we crack up this bad boy?
[57:46.910 --> 57:48.030]  Let's do it, basketball time!
[57:48.210 --> 57:49.390]  Okay, so explain what this is.
[57:49.530 --> 57:50.830]  So this is Hit Parade.
[57:50.890 --> 57:53.130]  Hit Parade does this thing where they have a bunch of products.
[57:53.470 --> 57:54.530]  In this case, it's basketballs.
[57:54.570 --> 57:55.970]  They get them signed by professional players.
[57:56.310 --> 57:58.970]  And then you get blind boxes, essentially, like this.
[57:59.210 --> 58:01.890]  So it could be something worth a lot, like I said.
[58:02.590 --> 58:04.290]  Maybe it's a Zion Williamson basketball.
[58:04.290 --> 58:07.610]  Or maybe it's Reggie Bullock.
[58:07.710 --> 58:08.550]  I don't know, we'll see.
[58:09.170 --> 58:09.550]  We'll see.
[58:10.130 --> 58:11.410]  I don't know if it's Reggie Bullock.
[58:11.910 --> 58:13.610]  He's currently a free agent and looking for a team.
[58:13.750 --> 58:14.830]  We'll be back next week.
[58:14.990 --> 58:18.570]  We'll have more cards to open, more fan mail, more of the stuff we showed today.
[58:19.070 --> 58:20.550]  But this will do it for us.
[58:20.730 --> 58:22.370]  I'm really excited for what this is.
[58:22.470 --> 58:23.850]  We got the Jet Ski, big hit.
[58:24.090 --> 58:24.710]  We did get the Jet Ski.
[58:24.710 --> 58:25.530]  Now we just need the Falcon.
[58:26.810 --> 58:28.370]  What if the ball is signed by a Falcon?
[58:28.650 --> 58:33.890]  What if we had like a Jack Hanna-style thing come here and someone just showed us animals?
[58:33.890 --> 58:35.310]  But we didn't know what it was.
[58:35.370 --> 58:36.310]  I mean, that's pretty exciting.
[58:36.570 --> 58:39.790]  Definitely not in the spirit of what the show is, but I'm into it.
[58:39.810 --> 58:40.090]  But it's like a secret.
[58:40.310 --> 58:41.530]  You don't know what's in the box.
[58:41.630 --> 58:41.710]  It's a secret.
[58:41.850 --> 58:43.910]  You don't know what the animal is.
[58:44.130 --> 58:44.330]  Okay.
[58:44.630 --> 58:46.070]  Wow, they really...
[58:46.070 --> 58:48.750]  What if it's not a basketball and it's just a paper mache ball?
[58:48.770 --> 58:49.990]  Then I've been duped.
[58:51.870 --> 58:52.770]  Alright, here we go.
[58:53.310 --> 58:55.750]  We have autographed basketball.
[58:56.010 --> 58:56.790]  Wash your hands.
[58:57.450 --> 58:57.810]  From...
[58:57.810 --> 58:58.530]  It's orange.
[58:58.750 --> 58:59.810]  Where are you going to be able...
[58:59.810 --> 59:01.150]  You're not going to be able to know who it is.
[59:02.090 --> 59:03.290]  It's Adam Silver.
[59:03.830 --> 59:05.510]  Okay, we have...
[59:05.510 --> 59:06.570]  It's got to be in the box.
[59:06.730 --> 59:08.630]  Like a certificate or something.
[59:09.290 --> 59:10.610]  How am I supposed to know who that is?
[59:12.610 --> 59:13.810]  Oh my God, I know what it is.
[59:13.950 --> 59:14.210]  What?
[59:14.310 --> 59:15.150]  Because there's a name in here.
[59:15.330 --> 59:16.130]  What do you think it is?
[59:17.050 --> 59:18.170]  Sorry, we have like four seconds.
[59:18.390 --> 59:19.070]  Show it again.
[59:19.150 --> 59:20.030]  I don't know who it is.
[59:20.590 --> 59:21.410]  I can't read it.
[59:21.490 --> 59:21.930]  I don't know.
[59:22.670 --> 59:23.030]  Wimby?
[59:23.750 --> 59:24.050]  Chewy.
[59:24.390 --> 59:24.690]  Chewy.
[59:25.190 --> 59:25.670]  Shaquille O'Neal.
[59:26.270 --> 59:26.910]  Are you serious?
[59:27.290 --> 59:27.890]  No way!
[59:28.130 --> 59:28.650]  Are you serious?
[59:28.650 --> 59:29.250]  It says Shaquille O'Neal!
[59:30.370 --> 59:31.370]  We got Shaq!
[59:32.910 --> 59:33.270]  What?!
[59:33.270 --> 59:33.970]  Where's our Shaq?
[59:34.110 --> 59:36.050]  I got to dunk the basketball!
[59:36.730 --> 59:37.670]  Hit him, do it!
[59:38.450 --> 59:40.030]  That's how I beat Shaq!
[59:40.390 --> 59:42.090]  We got the big Aristotle!
[59:42.430 --> 59:43.490]  Oh my God, that's awesome.
[59:43.670 --> 59:44.330]  Shaquille O'Neal.
[59:44.530 --> 59:44.930]  I have an...
[59:44.930 --> 59:46.190]  I love Sha...
[59:46.190 --> 59:46.990]  I've loved him my entire life.
[59:47.010 --> 59:47.730]  That's awesome!
[59:48.370 --> 59:49.370]  Oh, that's amazing.
[59:49.830 --> 59:50.910]  Dude, this episode rules.
[59:51.030 --> 59:51.610]  My dad got the new Shaq voice.
[59:51.610 --> 59:52.370]  This is the best.
[59:52.490 --> 59:53.170]  We got Jeske and Shaq.
[59:53.170 --> 59:54.070]  This has been a great episode.
[59:54.170 --> 59:54.810]  And Tom Sandoval.
[59:56.550 --> 59:57.270]  There you go.
