[00:09.800 --> 00:11.120]  I'll take the over and the under.
[00:11.420 --> 00:12.620]  Oh, hello there.
[00:12.960 --> 00:13.320]  Hi!
[00:15.200 --> 00:16.300]  It's been a day, huh?
[00:16.680 --> 00:16.920]  Yeah.
[00:17.240 --> 00:17.860]  All day.
[00:18.060 --> 00:19.620]  All day. How has your day been so far, Gus?
[00:19.740 --> 00:20.720]  Cold. Frigid.
[00:20.920 --> 00:21.260]  Really?
[00:21.420 --> 00:21.680]  Yeah.
[00:23.100 --> 00:26.280]  I'll be honest, I didn't know you were on this show until Emily told me.
[00:28.100 --> 00:28.460]  Surprise!
[00:29.020 --> 00:30.360]  I didn't know until I got here.
[00:30.440 --> 00:32.960]  And I go, hey Gus, what are you doing here?
[00:33.060 --> 00:36.480]  It's such a welcome surprise. I almost invited Gavin to be on it today.
[00:36.960 --> 00:38.120]  I didn't want to bug him.
[00:38.120 --> 00:40.960]  I guess Eric and Gracie worked it out.
[00:41.140 --> 00:41.980]  Yeah, they figured it out.
[00:42.200 --> 00:44.180]  Lifesavers. Really, really appreciate it.
[00:44.180 --> 00:45.420]  Talk about people doing their jobs.
[00:45.500 --> 00:46.240]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:47.780 --> 00:49.900]  Just not used to the competence of a Gracie.
[00:50.120 --> 00:50.460]  Yeah.
[00:50.600 --> 00:53.340]  It would have been awkward if Gavin had to sit in my lap.
[00:53.540 --> 00:54.980]  You guys would have to share, definitely.
[00:55.180 --> 00:56.480]  There would not be an additional chair.
[00:56.560 --> 00:58.920]  It would be the fulfillment of a lot of shipping stories I read.
[01:00.260 --> 01:02.860]  Okay, hey, welcome to The Break Show.
[01:03.940 --> 01:05.240]  My name is Geoff.
[01:05.480 --> 01:09.740]  With me as sometimes Gus and then as almost always Emily.
[01:10.360 --> 01:13.820]  As you probably know, we open up cards.
[01:14.580 --> 01:15.380]  Any kind of collectibles.
[01:15.580 --> 01:18.100]  From Celebrity Ducks. Gus, are you familiar with Celebrity Ducks?
[01:18.140 --> 01:19.260]  I cannot say I am.
[01:19.600 --> 01:21.700]  That's a Lamar Odom Celebrity Duck.
[01:22.100 --> 01:23.880]  He doesn't have like a ducky nickname?
[01:24.360 --> 01:28.160]  No, they really just put their likeness on a duck and then call it that.
[01:28.420 --> 01:31.220]  It was apparently a big deal in the late 90s and early 2000s.
[01:31.220 --> 01:33.080]  There's even a Celebrity Duck Museum.
[01:33.880 --> 01:35.460]  I feel like they phoned it in with the bill.
[01:35.560 --> 01:36.360]  They don't make them anymore.
[01:36.520 --> 01:37.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:37.440 --> 01:38.900]  I wonder if Lamar Odom had something to do with that.
[01:38.980 --> 01:40.380]  He was like, I'm not a big bill kind of guy.
[01:41.400 --> 01:43.060]  Anyway, I bought that for like 30 bucks.
[01:43.380 --> 01:44.580]  Just so I could put it on the set.
[01:45.440 --> 01:46.220]  To show that everything...
[01:47.000 --> 01:47.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:47.800 --> 01:48.100]  Clearly.
[01:49.480 --> 01:55.500]  Speaking of me getting ripped off, let's show last week's hits and then figure out how much they aren't worth.
[01:56.300 --> 02:00.980]  It's the most depressing part of the show for me is when we go through the hits.
[02:01.640 --> 02:03.720]  And that we are all excited about last week.
[02:03.740 --> 02:05.800]  And then we find out that they're not worth anything.
[02:05.920 --> 02:06.140]  Yeah.
[02:06.580 --> 02:10.080]  And that this whole collecting thing is just a sham.
[02:10.360 --> 02:10.600]  Yeah.
[02:11.100 --> 02:12.040]  But man, is it fun.
[02:12.860 --> 02:15.260]  And we get to build the greatest collection in the history of collections.
[02:15.420 --> 02:15.560]  Yes.
[02:16.060 --> 02:16.720]  It's like art.
[02:16.900 --> 02:18.280]  It's only worth what someone wants to pay for it.
[02:18.380 --> 02:18.800]  There you go.
[02:19.040 --> 02:23.100]  What do you think someone wants to pay for a Trevor Lawrence mosaic bass rookie?
[02:23.420 --> 02:24.160]  What's your guess, Gus?
[02:26.260 --> 02:27.580]  That's Trevor Lawrence, huh?
[02:27.580 --> 02:33.100]  He's the only quarterback out of that whole class of quarterbacks that ended up doing anything.
[02:33.100 --> 02:34.480]  That's about $7.50.
[02:35.200 --> 02:36.800]  I'll take the upper.
[02:37.140 --> 02:38.100]  You'll take the over on that?
[02:38.240 --> 02:38.520]  The over, yeah.
[02:39.080 --> 02:41.660]  That's going to run you... the upper on that's going to be wrong.
[02:41.760 --> 02:43.660]  That's going to run you $3.50.
[02:44.300 --> 02:45.400]  One point for Gus.
[02:45.640 --> 02:50.920]  How about a Nico Collins orange reactive parallel rookie?
[02:51.380 --> 02:53.580]  You see it's technically a prism.
[02:53.860 --> 02:54.240]  It's orange reactive.
[02:54.240 --> 02:54.280]  It's pretty.
[02:54.840 --> 02:55.500]  It's a parallel.
[02:55.500 --> 02:57.800]  So it's rarer than the base.
[02:57.960 --> 03:03.060]  Nico Collins is kind of a... a liked rookie in the league this year.
[03:03.400 --> 03:03.840]  Texans.
[03:04.180 --> 03:04.620]  Texans.
[03:04.900 --> 03:06.920]  Texans doing better than anybody thought they would.
[03:07.180 --> 03:08.360]  What do you guys think?
[03:08.460 --> 03:09.100]  What do you think, Gus?
[03:09.100 --> 03:10.560]  That's a $15 card.
[03:11.080 --> 03:11.520]  Under.
[03:12.200 --> 03:12.700]  You'll take the under?
[03:13.160 --> 03:15.980]  This bad boy right now could be yours for $1.25.
[03:16.300 --> 03:16.360]  Woo!
[03:16.720 --> 03:17.420]  One point for Emily!
[03:17.640 --> 03:17.900]  Yes!
[03:18.220 --> 03:18.880]  I'm a sucker.
[03:19.260 --> 03:24.220]  How about this badass sideways prism, silver prism Zach Charbonnet card?
[03:24.220 --> 03:27.440]  Remember, a prism is about 10 times rarer than a base card.
[03:27.460 --> 03:31.060]  And it is considered the rookie card you want to get.
[03:33.040 --> 03:34.480]  That's... again, it's pretty.
[03:34.620 --> 03:35.260]  That affects me.
[03:35.360 --> 03:35.920]  It's sparkly.
[03:36.260 --> 03:36.940]  That's $8.
[03:38.400 --> 03:40.100]  Oh, I'll do the under.
[03:40.520 --> 03:41.140]  That's $1.
[03:41.360 --> 03:41.600]  Woo!
[03:41.980 --> 03:42.900]  I'm not good at this.
[03:43.120 --> 03:46.320]  We're going to leave those sports behind.
[03:46.380 --> 03:47.720]  We're going to go to combat sports.
[03:47.960 --> 03:52.520]  Bo Nickel, if you don't know who Bo Nickel is, he's kind of a popular young UFC fighter.
[03:52.520 --> 03:53.820]  He doesn't know how to spell nickel.
[03:54.200 --> 03:57.660]  Well, he did about four fights ago.
[03:57.720 --> 03:58.900]  That's how he spells it now.
[03:58.920 --> 04:00.280]  He got the E knocked out of him.
[04:00.340 --> 04:01.380]  Yeah, he got the E knocked out of him.
[04:02.560 --> 04:03.560]  That's $0.75.
[04:04.200 --> 04:04.700]  Oh, prior.
[04:05.000 --> 04:05.240]  Above.
[04:05.540 --> 04:05.700]  Wait.
[04:05.840 --> 04:06.060]  $3!
[04:06.540 --> 04:06.780]  No!
[04:07.320 --> 04:07.540]  Wow!
[04:07.620 --> 04:09.040]  She's 0 for everything today.
[04:09.240 --> 04:10.180]  No, he got one.
[04:10.220 --> 04:10.620]  Oh, that's true.
[04:10.620 --> 04:11.180]  You got the first one.
[04:11.700 --> 04:12.700]  Sorry, I don't mean to...
[04:12.700 --> 04:13.260]  Okay, here we go.
[04:13.500 --> 04:13.800]  Here we go.
[04:13.880 --> 04:15.080]  Maybe this will be a little bit more interesting.
[04:15.620 --> 04:18.880]  Here we have a Tito Ortiz legendary signatures.
[04:19.240 --> 04:21.600]  It is a sticker signature, but it is...
[04:22.480 --> 04:24.000]  still a prism signature.
[04:24.560 --> 04:25.780]  That is some sort of parallel.
[04:25.920 --> 04:26.920]  Fast break parallel, I think.
[04:27.340 --> 04:28.100]  Did we meet him at E3?
[04:28.340 --> 04:29.160]  We met him at E3.
[04:29.420 --> 04:29.920]  We met him.
[04:29.940 --> 04:31.640]  You and I met him and Chuck Liddell.
[04:31.740 --> 04:32.340]  Chuck Liddell, yeah.
[04:32.720 --> 04:34.240]  In 2001?
[04:35.240 --> 04:37.320]  Wow, so they were both at their height.
[04:37.600 --> 04:40.460]  Yeah, they were speaking a little more clearly than they do on interviews now.
[04:40.760 --> 04:41.420]  For sure.
[04:41.600 --> 04:44.160]  Just because we met him, it's worth more because he knows me.
[04:44.340 --> 04:44.600]  Right.
[04:44.880 --> 04:45.720]  The transit of property.
[04:45.780 --> 04:47.100]  Yeah, that's $11.
[04:47.940 --> 04:49.000]  I'll take the over.
[04:49.560 --> 04:50.600]  That'll run you $20.
[04:50.600 --> 04:51.320]  $20.
[04:52.000 --> 04:52.400]  Wow.
[04:52.840 --> 04:53.760]  Emily, you're killing it.
[04:53.820 --> 04:54.760]  It's like you do it all the time, huh?
[04:54.860 --> 04:55.380]  I'm doing all right.
[04:55.780 --> 04:58.560]  Jason Tatum, just last year's prism, silver.
[04:59.100 --> 05:01.440]  Silver prism, I bring it up because that's the chase card.
[05:01.560 --> 05:05.640]  If you wanted the Jason Tatum prism card from last year, you would want this silver prism.
[05:06.120 --> 05:09.780]  Tatum, one of the five best, and I'll fucking fight you if you disagree.
[05:10.440 --> 05:12.940]  One of the five best players in the NBA right now.
[05:13.140 --> 05:16.440]  Should be top three by the end of this season when he wins the MVP as the Celtics.
[05:17.720 --> 05:18.560]  And when they win the finals.
[05:18.560 --> 05:20.580]  Win the finals and receive banner 18.
[05:20.820 --> 05:20.960]  Yeah.
[05:22.060 --> 05:23.160]  Next year's going to be tricky.
[05:23.480 --> 05:26.660]  We're going to be dealing with trying to figure out how to pay all these people and keep them.
[05:26.720 --> 05:28.620]  But we got Tatum locked down for a while.
[05:28.900 --> 05:30.420]  Or we will after we sign him.
[05:30.720 --> 05:32.360]  Anyway, what do you think of this bad boy?
[05:32.360 --> 05:35.240]  He'd just have to sell his cards to be able to pay his salary.
[05:35.540 --> 05:38.180]  That bad boy's worth...
[05:39.000 --> 05:39.720]  $5.50.
[05:40.040 --> 05:40.360]  Over.
[05:41.220 --> 05:41.520]  $3.
[05:42.200 --> 05:43.440]  Yes, that's another one for Gus.
[05:43.840 --> 05:44.620]  Another one for Gus.
[05:45.180 --> 05:46.220]  This is going to go for a while.
[05:46.220 --> 05:48.620]  I got enough of these.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.080]  Scotty Pippen Jr.
[05:50.320 --> 05:51.060]  All right, here we go.
[05:51.180 --> 05:52.600]  Nepotism rookie card.
[05:53.360 --> 05:54.500]  Playing for the Lakers.
[05:54.820 --> 05:56.160]  It's a silver prism as well.
[05:56.360 --> 06:00.300]  Once again, this is the rookie card you want to get if you believe in Scotty Pippen Jr.
[06:00.980 --> 06:04.360]  Clearly, Scotty Pippen Jr., the son of Scotty Pippen Sr.
[06:05.020 --> 06:06.320]  Famous Chicago Bull.
[06:07.140 --> 06:10.780]  Michael Jordan's right-hand man and frenemy.
[06:12.180 --> 06:14.040]  What do you think that puppy will run you?
[06:14.060 --> 06:14.460]  $2.50.
[06:14.800 --> 06:15.140]  Over.
[06:16.760 --> 06:17.120]  $2.
[06:17.220 --> 06:17.580]  Wow!
[06:18.820 --> 06:20.020]  You almost got it right.
[06:20.180 --> 06:22.140]  If you get it on the nose, you get 10 points automatically.
[06:22.160 --> 06:22.840]  Oh, hell yeah.
[06:22.860 --> 06:23.280]  I just made that up.
[06:24.420 --> 06:25.500]  Here's where things get interesting.
[06:26.120 --> 06:26.400]  Boom.
[06:26.540 --> 06:27.220]  Alan and Genther.
[06:27.360 --> 06:28.260]  Eloy Jimenez.
[06:29.040 --> 06:29.700]  Relic card.
[06:29.880 --> 06:32.380]  I don't know if you can tell, but that is a shaving of his bat.
[06:32.580 --> 06:33.720]  A game-used bat.
[06:34.060 --> 06:35.920]  It's actually a piece of a wooden baseball bat.
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.340]  If you collect enough of those, you can have a bat.
[06:37.440 --> 06:40.480]  If you collect about 3,000 of them, you can reassemble the bat.
[06:41.380 --> 06:42.100]  Eloy Jimenez.
[06:43.040 --> 06:45.100]  Promising young player on the Chicago White Sox.
[06:45.200 --> 06:46.340]  One of the worst teams in baseball.
[06:46.720 --> 06:47.940]  Also my favorite team.
[06:49.320 --> 06:51.980]  Got hit for not being a leader in the locker room.
[06:52.360 --> 06:53.040]  That'll happen.
[06:53.140 --> 06:53.820]  In the locker room?
[06:53.880 --> 06:54.020]  Yeah.
[06:54.180 --> 06:54.860]  Is he a leader on the field?
[06:55.400 --> 06:57.960]  No, he's not a leader on the field or in the locker room, unfortunately.
[06:59.200 --> 07:00.320]  What do you think that bad boy?
[07:00.380 --> 07:00.720]  Relic.
[07:01.060 --> 07:02.320]  It's a piece of...
[07:02.320 --> 07:02.900]  It's a history.
[07:03.200 --> 07:04.700]  He used that in a game.
[07:04.820 --> 07:07.840]  He's getting dinged for not being a leader, so that's only worse.
[07:09.180 --> 07:10.340]  That's $4.73.
[07:11.460 --> 07:11.860]  Over.
[07:12.460 --> 07:12.860]  $2.
[07:13.640 --> 07:14.840]  Got another point for Gus.
[07:15.340 --> 07:17.280]  It was a real shitty week for Geoff on values.
[07:19.920 --> 07:20.880]  I'm gonna throw this one out.
[07:20.940 --> 07:22.200]  This is Jordan Shusterman.
[07:22.380 --> 07:23.760]  He's a baseball blogger.
[07:24.300 --> 07:25.480]  Allen and Ginter, 2019.
[07:26.320 --> 07:27.200]  Got a relic card.
[07:27.320 --> 07:28.140]  What does he get a...
[07:28.140 --> 07:28.340]  Exactly.
[07:29.240 --> 07:31.100]  Why does he get a card and not Geoff?
[07:31.220 --> 07:33.720]  This is my, like, focus in life right now.
[07:33.900 --> 07:36.060]  I need to get Allen or Ginter on the horn.
[07:36.340 --> 07:40.300]  And why does a baseball blogger get a card and not Geoff?
[07:40.780 --> 07:43.400]  Geoff is wearing a Topps sweater.
[07:43.620 --> 07:43.880]  Yeah.
[07:44.000 --> 07:44.720]  What is that?
[07:45.040 --> 07:45.420]  That's true.
[07:45.940 --> 07:47.420]  I bought this with money.
[07:47.660 --> 07:48.220]  The real one.
[07:48.320 --> 07:49.080]  He's the real one.
[07:49.140 --> 07:49.780]  I am the real one.
[07:50.060 --> 07:50.640]  What is that?
[07:50.920 --> 07:52.580]  Like, the other card had a bat.
[07:52.700 --> 07:53.320]  What is that on there?
[07:53.400 --> 07:55.680]  This is fabric, so it's probably...
[07:55.680 --> 07:56.620]  Game-worn t-shirt.
[07:56.740 --> 07:57.600]  Is it part of his keyboard?
[07:57.980 --> 07:58.980]  Yeah, it's...
[07:58.980 --> 08:00.060]  He blogged in it.
[08:00.260 --> 08:02.020]  It's like a t-shirt he wore.
[08:02.400 --> 08:03.340]  A t-shirt he wore.
[08:04.040 --> 08:05.260]  Like, Hames, beefy.
[08:05.500 --> 08:06.540]  That's 12 cents.
[08:06.840 --> 08:08.920]  Yeah, I don't even think you can find a value of it.
[08:09.120 --> 08:09.320]  $1.
[08:10.340 --> 08:11.180]  Wow, $1?
[08:11.180 --> 08:11.520]  $1.
[08:12.020 --> 08:13.280]  He would pay you $1?
[08:14.060 --> 08:14.580]  Here we go.
[08:14.780 --> 08:20.360]  Second hottest basketball rookie of the year, Scoot Henderson, played for the Ignite.
[08:20.480 --> 08:22.020]  This is an Allen and Ginter card.
[08:22.420 --> 08:27.420]  Obviously, the 2023 NBA cards aren't out yet, so if you want to get your Scoot Henderson
[08:27.420 --> 08:31.470]  or if you want to get your Victor Wim Benyama, you gotta get an Allen and Ginter or the Topps
[08:32.080 --> 08:32.620]  College shit.
[08:32.960 --> 08:33.080]  Okay.
[08:33.100 --> 08:35.140]  So, what do you think this will run you?
[08:35.140 --> 08:35.840]  This is a base card.
[08:35.840 --> 08:36.200]  This is a base card.
[08:36.200 --> 08:39.420]  You're gonna scoot on over to the bank and withdraw 15 cents for that.
[08:39.520 --> 08:39.760]  Over.
[08:40.320 --> 08:40.680]  $3.
[08:41.000 --> 08:41.360]  Wow.
[08:42.580 --> 08:43.940]  More than the blogger's card.
[08:44.260 --> 08:45.840]  Gus, I dedicate this one to you.
[08:45.880 --> 08:47.280]  I didn't know you'd be here, but here you go.
[08:47.540 --> 08:49.880]  This is an Allen and Ginter history of flight card.
[08:49.980 --> 08:50.180]  Ooh.
[08:50.360 --> 08:51.140]  You love to fly.
[08:51.140 --> 08:51.740]  Which one was that?
[08:52.000 --> 08:53.240]  That's one of them.
[08:53.600 --> 08:54.220]  The Space Shuttle?
[08:54.220 --> 08:54.860]  It's the Endeavor.
[08:55.120 --> 08:55.380]  Oh.
[08:55.520 --> 08:56.700]  Was that the one that...
[08:56.700 --> 08:58.900]  No, that was either Challenger or Columbia.
[08:58.960 --> 08:59.120]  Columbia is what I'm thinking of.
[08:59.120 --> 09:00.400]  No, you can tell it's in one piece.
[09:00.780 --> 09:05.200]  I lived in Houston at the time, and there was a whole thing about, like, the debris everywhere.
[09:05.200 --> 09:06.680]  They kept saying, like, don't touch it.
[09:06.880 --> 09:08.060]  Right, because it could be somebody's finger.
[09:08.540 --> 09:09.040]  Oh, yeah.
[09:09.180 --> 09:14.540]  We know a guy who, like, coordinated satellites to try to, like, search for pieces over East Texas.
[09:14.780 --> 09:15.060]  Do we?
[09:15.260 --> 09:15.440]  Yeah.
[09:16.100 --> 09:16.900]  Back from T&I days?
[09:16.980 --> 09:17.400]  No, no, no.
[09:17.440 --> 09:19.020]  He was, like, a friend of a friend, lived up north.
[09:20.220 --> 09:21.440]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:21.440 --> 09:21.660]  Okay.
[09:22.980 --> 09:24.300]  We can give names afterwards.
[09:24.920 --> 09:25.680]  Tune into ANMA.
[09:25.880 --> 09:26.520]  You can give names.
[09:26.840 --> 09:26.940]  Yeah.
[09:27.760 --> 09:28.780]  Space Shuttle, huh?
[09:28.960 --> 09:29.320]  Endeavor?
[09:29.480 --> 09:31.300]  Endeavor is one of the lesser-liked shuttles.
[09:31.500 --> 09:32.600]  It was always kind of a diva.
[09:33.960 --> 09:35.320]  That's going to run you $1.75.
[09:36.180 --> 09:36.540]  Over.
[09:36.920 --> 09:37.480]  That's a dollar.
[09:37.740 --> 09:38.620]  Dollar, dang.
[09:38.980 --> 09:40.380]  I love having you on this show.
[09:40.660 --> 09:41.580]  It's such a delight.
[09:41.800 --> 09:42.540]  I got to be honest with you.
[09:42.600 --> 09:46.280]  Last card, Pete Alonzo, I believe the American League Rookie of the Year that year, 2019,
[09:46.800 --> 09:49.540]  turned into a bona fide star of Major League Baseball.
[09:50.120 --> 09:53.640]  Probably going to be leaving the Mets here if they do a full rebuild.
[09:54.380 --> 09:55.440]  Allen against your base rookie.
[09:55.560 --> 09:56.500]  What do you think that runs?
[09:57.060 --> 09:57.780]  2019 card.
[09:57.880 --> 09:58.280]  It's a little older.
[09:58.480 --> 09:59.140]  It's pre-COVID.
[09:59.480 --> 10:00.180]  Pre-COVID card.
[10:00.180 --> 10:03.120]  So that's $4.25.
[10:03.440 --> 10:03.800]  Under.
[10:04.080 --> 10:04.340]  $2.
[10:05.480 --> 10:10.780]  All in all, with the exception of a Tito Ortiz autograph, pretty dogshit week.
[10:11.200 --> 10:12.380]  Dogshit week for values.
[10:12.660 --> 10:13.960]  Pretty just doo-doo dogshit.
[10:14.240 --> 10:18.400]  We're not paying the rent off these cards this month.
[10:18.580 --> 10:18.680]  No.
[10:18.760 --> 10:19.020]  Sorry.
[10:19.080 --> 10:20.540]  The guessing game's the real joy of it all.
[10:20.540 --> 10:21.080]  That's fun.
[10:21.160 --> 10:21.780]  It's classic.
[10:22.080 --> 10:25.660]  Someone in chat, I forget who it was, it passed by, someone in chat said that that piece of
[10:25.660 --> 10:27.660]  fabric in the blogger card was part of his mousepad.
[10:27.820 --> 10:28.600]  And I thought that was really funny.
[10:28.600 --> 10:29.020]  Oh!
[10:29.820 --> 10:30.140]  Okay.
[10:30.200 --> 10:30.420]  Maybe it is.
[10:31.820 --> 10:32.740]  That's pretty good, huh?
[10:32.920 --> 10:33.860]  I wish I had thought of that.
[10:33.880 --> 10:34.440]  That makes sense, actually.
[10:35.220 --> 10:35.540]  Wow.
[10:35.880 --> 10:38.760]  Okay, well, I wasn't anticipating having Gus here, so I brought a bunch of other stuff
[10:38.760 --> 10:39.120]  to open.
[10:39.380 --> 10:43.020]  We don't have to open it because we can dive into Gus's stuff, but I do want to get into
[10:43.020 --> 10:44.480]  the holiday spirit a little bit.
[10:44.540 --> 10:44.700]  Yeah.
[10:44.780 --> 10:44.940]  Okay.
[10:45.260 --> 10:47.140]  A recent...
[10:47.140 --> 10:51.080]  I've been thinking, maybe I need to get better about talking about new releases when stuff
[10:51.080 --> 10:51.680]  comes out, right?
[10:51.760 --> 10:52.080]  Mm-hmm.
[10:52.140 --> 10:55.380]  So, a couple of big lines that just hit.
[10:55.440 --> 10:56.880]  One, I'll just show this off.
[10:56.880 --> 10:58.280]  This is NBA Flux.
[10:58.760 --> 10:59.700]  I like it.
[11:00.200 --> 11:01.560]  It's a cool card.
[11:01.760 --> 11:03.200]  This is a Hobby Box.
[11:03.320 --> 11:06.160]  Actually, they're both Hobby Boxes, and there's two differences here.
[11:06.600 --> 11:09.880]  One, this one, Gracie bought me, and then this one, I bought us.
[11:09.960 --> 11:10.140]  Yeah.
[11:10.280 --> 11:12.840]  But there's more than just that difference in who purchased it.
[11:13.060 --> 11:14.240]  This is a first-off-the-line box.
[11:14.340 --> 11:17.040]  I don't know if we've opened a first-off-the-line box...
[11:17.040 --> 11:17.320]  No.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.540]  Oh, yeah, it's got a sticker on it.
[11:20.280 --> 11:23.540]  ...yet on the show, so I wanted to get a regular...
[11:23.540 --> 11:24.640]  This is a regular Hobby Box.
[11:24.640 --> 11:27.140]  I think it was $230.
[11:27.800 --> 11:29.880]  This is a first-off-the-line Hobby Box.
[11:30.020 --> 11:35.280]  I'm going to guess this pay was like $350, probably, and the only difference is that sticker.
[11:35.740 --> 11:38.360]  Okay, and that it was the first that was packaged.
[11:38.540 --> 11:42.400]  Yeah, first-off-the-line means, like, they are the first boxes to come off the production line.
[11:42.400 --> 11:43.780]  So they haven't worked out the problems yet.
[11:44.140 --> 11:46.500]  Well, what they do is they include special cards.
[11:46.600 --> 11:48.980]  So they are first-off-the-line, only special.
[11:49.160 --> 11:50.840]  And there's 50 cards in each box?
[11:51.200 --> 11:51.800]  Yeah, 50.
[11:52.000 --> 11:52.880]  Same and same.
[11:53.100 --> 11:58.280]  It's just you have slightly higher chances of getting better cards than this one, which you get better chances than retail.
[11:58.560 --> 12:04.320]  And that this one, you'll get one or two parallels that are only in this box.
[12:04.460 --> 12:08.040]  Is Flux the one where it's a little bit from each line?
[12:08.520 --> 12:08.980]  Which one is that one?
[12:08.980 --> 12:10.040]  No, Flux came from that.
[12:10.500 --> 12:10.800]  Okay.
[12:11.040 --> 12:13.100]  Flux came out of that line, and they all broke out into individual...
[12:13.800 --> 12:14.060]  Okay.
[12:14.340 --> 12:14.940]  Which one?
[12:15.020 --> 12:16.980]  You get one that has a little bit from everybody.
[12:17.020 --> 12:18.260]  It's like Contenders, I think, maybe.
[12:18.700 --> 12:19.420]  Oh, okay, maybe, yeah.
[12:19.980 --> 12:20.780]  Or Chronicles.
[12:20.940 --> 12:21.540]  I think it's Chronicles.
[12:21.540 --> 12:23.000]  I don't buy them anymore because it's dogshit.
[12:23.040 --> 12:29.600]  But anyway, so we'll open that up next time, and we'll see if it's worth the extra hundred bucks to get the first-off-the-line versus just the regular hobby.
[12:29.600 --> 12:31.760]  Well, it has to be, like, good Gracie box, and then...
[12:31.760 --> 12:32.180]  Yeah.
[12:32.560 --> 12:33.720]  Flux is also a fun card game.
[12:33.840 --> 12:34.100]  It is.
[12:34.380 --> 12:35.100]  It's a card game?
[12:35.340 --> 12:36.100]  It is a fun card game.
[12:36.160 --> 12:36.840]  Do you play with these cards?
[12:36.960 --> 12:37.400]  It's not this.
[12:37.480 --> 12:38.260]  It's totally unrelated.
[12:38.420 --> 12:39.060]  It just has the same name.
[12:39.500 --> 12:44.240]  The next one that popped out that we will open is the T.O.P.S. Holiday Mega Box.
[12:44.560 --> 12:45.300]  Just came out.
[12:45.400 --> 12:46.400]  T.O.P.S. Holiday...
[12:46.880 --> 12:49.040]  All I have are Halloween noises.
[12:50.280 --> 12:52.180]  But then that just sounded like a burp.
[12:52.300 --> 12:54.860]  It was supposed to be a werewolf, like, whirr.
[12:55.100 --> 12:58.200]  T.O.P.S. and Panini both release holiday cards.
[12:59.820 --> 13:00.660]  Everybody... that was good.
[13:00.980 --> 13:04.640]  Everybody shits on the Panini holiday cards, but they love the T.O.P.S. holiday cards.
[13:04.760 --> 13:05.760]  So we'll open these up.
[13:05.840 --> 13:12.160]  What you're looking for, basically, it's the same cards as the regular T.O.P.S. baseball cards or the regular Panini basketball cards, for instance.
[13:12.160 --> 13:16.880]  But they just have... they're holiday-fied.
[13:17.140 --> 13:19.040]  So you can see they have snow in the background.
[13:19.420 --> 13:21.320]  These two cards are actually parallels.
[13:22.500 --> 13:24.580]  Or S.P.s, as they call them, short prints.
[13:24.900 --> 13:30.560]  I don't want to freak you guys out, but the little red hats that they're wearing, those are photoshopped on.
[13:30.580 --> 13:32.260]  It's not Christmas in July?
[13:32.600 --> 13:34.400]  It was not Christmas in July for me.
[13:34.980 --> 13:37.280]  I didn't think that was league-approved headwear.
[13:37.540 --> 13:40.320]  Has it ever snowed at a baseball game? Ever?
[13:40.520 --> 13:41.220]  I assume so.
[13:42.320 --> 13:43.580]  Maybe in the World Series?
[13:44.400 --> 13:46.600]  Because it snows in football games.
[13:46.760 --> 13:50.840]  The World Series, nowadays, is played later than it used to be.
[13:52.480 --> 13:55.420]  I don't know how long, the last 15 years, 10 years?
[13:56.580 --> 13:58.500]  That's why they call Reggie Jackson Mr. October.
[13:58.760 --> 14:01.420]  Because he used to be like, all said and done in October.
[14:01.540 --> 14:04.060]  But now it's just starting in late October, early November.
[14:04.380 --> 14:05.660]  I would say yes, probably.
[14:05.720 --> 14:06.380]  It has to have...
[14:06.380 --> 14:07.100]  I would assume so.
[14:07.140 --> 14:07.920]  I'll look it up.
[14:08.020 --> 14:08.320]  Colorado?
[14:09.040 --> 14:09.780]  Yeah, Colorado.
[14:09.780 --> 14:10.820]  In October, yeah.
[14:10.820 --> 14:11.280]  New York?
[14:11.340 --> 14:12.780]  It would be interesting to...
[14:12.780 --> 14:13.820]  Minnesota Twins?
[14:14.780 --> 14:14.900]  Yeah.
[14:14.960 --> 14:17.720]  Anyway, so what we're looking for is these...
[14:17.720 --> 14:19.820]  If they have these little Christmas hats on,
[14:19.920 --> 14:22.980]  or if they have a necklace of Christmas lights,
[14:23.140 --> 14:25.220]  or if they have snow skis on.
[14:25.540 --> 14:26.880]  They put snow skis on them?
[14:26.940 --> 14:29.560]  Like ski... what do you call them? Ice skis? Ice skates?
[14:29.640 --> 14:30.100]  Ice skates.
[14:30.620 --> 14:32.960]  Real subtle Photoshop work they got going on here.
[14:33.100 --> 14:35.580]  I'm fucking... I'm sorry, I didn't get to eat until four minutes ago.
[14:35.660 --> 14:38.780]  Okay, and then it comes with a free ornament, and this one is...
[14:38.780 --> 14:40.600]  We should put that on our Christmas tree.
[14:40.600 --> 14:41.840]  I guess if you want to get an ornament,
[14:42.020 --> 14:43.140]  Shohei's probably the one you want to get.
[14:44.040 --> 14:45.900]  Did you get that out of a box, or did you buy it?
[14:45.960 --> 14:47.320]  It came in this, in the Mega...
[14:47.320 --> 14:47.720]  Just now?
[14:47.920 --> 14:48.120]  Yeah.
[14:48.240 --> 14:48.680]  Oh, that's so cool!
[14:49.460 --> 14:50.320]  Every box has one.
[14:50.800 --> 14:53.120]  They'll also be a relic of a Christmas sweater,
[14:53.140 --> 14:55.140]  or an autograph in this box somewhere.
[14:55.940 --> 14:56.580]  Oh, fun!
[14:56.900 --> 14:58.240]  Now, did you get this online?
[14:58.400 --> 14:59.200]  Because I know I found it once in the store.
[14:59.200 --> 15:00.400]  I bought this at Walmart.
[15:00.420 --> 15:01.360]  Okay, so you did get it at the store.
[15:01.360 --> 15:01.800]  This is retail only.
[15:01.980 --> 15:04.500]  They actually don't have hobby versions of these.
[15:04.620 --> 15:04.760]  Okay.
[15:04.940 --> 15:06.560]  So this is what a normal card looks like.
[15:06.620 --> 15:08.900]  It's the same card as the regular tops,
[15:08.900 --> 15:10.540]  it just has a different...
[15:10.540 --> 15:11.860]  has the candy cane striping,
[15:12.040 --> 15:13.120]  and then it has the snow, right?
[15:13.260 --> 15:13.320]  Cute.
[15:14.600 --> 15:14.960]  So...
[15:14.960 --> 15:17.020]  But what we're looking for is cards that...
[15:18.140 --> 15:18.820]  Have the little edits.
[15:19.400 --> 15:21.400]  Yeah, the little SPs.
[15:21.480 --> 15:24.480]  And there are differing levels of rarity.
[15:24.900 --> 15:27.840]  Does it depend on the player?
[15:29.040 --> 15:30.220]  Yeah, only some players have it.
[15:30.360 --> 15:31.580]  But it's like a hundred players,
[15:31.720 --> 15:32.860]  so it's hard to memorize.
[15:33.120 --> 15:34.740]  Adolos Garcia, you might remember him, Emily,
[15:34.840 --> 15:36.640]  as the guy who hit every home run in the postseason.
[15:36.680 --> 15:37.920]  Yes, that's his card we want!
[15:37.920 --> 15:38.920]  Yeah, we're gonna...
[15:39.460 --> 15:40.420]  Emily wants to chase his rookie.
[15:40.900 --> 15:41.680]  He's been pretty...
[15:41.680 --> 15:43.480]  He did the triple dipper, or the...
[15:43.480 --> 15:43.860]  What was it?
[15:43.880 --> 15:44.680]  He had a grand slam.
[15:44.780 --> 15:44.940]  Grand slam.
[15:45.100 --> 15:45.280]  Yeah.
[15:45.960 --> 15:48.460]  But he hit a walk-off homer in the 11th inning the other night.
[15:48.540 --> 15:48.680]  Yeah.
[15:48.920 --> 15:49.820]  That was awesome.
[15:50.060 --> 15:51.220]  Petition to call it a triple dipper.
[15:51.420 --> 15:52.200]  Triple dipper, isn't it good?
[15:52.300 --> 15:53.020]  Triple dipper's not bad, right?
[15:53.560 --> 15:54.460]  Sponsored by Chili's.
[15:55.340 --> 15:56.800]  So once we get through these real fast,
[15:56.880 --> 15:59.620]  then we'll switch into Gus's cards.
[15:59.880 --> 16:02.140]  The guy named Velo says it snowed during the 97 World Series.
[16:02.260 --> 16:02.880]  Ah, there you go.
[16:03.160 --> 16:04.460]  Shane Bieber, no relation to Justin.
[16:06.780 --> 16:07.420]  Joey Menzies.
[16:07.420 --> 16:08.920]  That'd be a good one for ice skates.
[16:09.840 --> 16:10.800]  Victor Grissom.
[16:10.980 --> 16:11.420]  No.
[16:12.400 --> 16:13.600]  Hunter Brown, rookie.
[16:13.800 --> 16:14.640]  I'm just...
[16:14.640 --> 16:15.960]  Okay, here's a parallel.
[16:16.300 --> 16:17.020]  You can see it's gray.
[16:17.340 --> 16:17.960]  Austin Riley.
[16:18.240 --> 16:20.640]  The nice thing about these parallels is the...
[16:20.640 --> 16:21.880]  It's embossed.
[16:21.880 --> 16:22.360]  Ooh.
[16:22.860 --> 16:23.880]  Feel it embossed.
[16:24.420 --> 16:24.900]  Oh, yeah.
[16:25.180 --> 16:25.700]  That's nice.
[16:25.800 --> 16:27.120]  Like the snow is, like, raised.
[16:27.240 --> 16:28.020]  Yeah, the snow's raised.
[16:28.120 --> 16:28.740]  Boba Shett.
[16:29.220 --> 16:29.580]  Boba Fett?
[16:29.580 --> 16:30.460]  I love that name.
[16:30.680 --> 16:31.760]  Close to Boba Fett.
[16:32.000 --> 16:32.520]  O'Neal Cruz.
[16:33.760 --> 16:34.720]  Wilson Contreras.
[16:35.400 --> 16:37.060]  Ryan McMahon laying out there.
[16:37.060 --> 16:37.540]  Nice.
[16:38.140 --> 16:39.520]  That'd be good for ice skates, too.
[16:40.260 --> 16:40.380]  Yeah.
[16:40.540 --> 16:41.460]  That would've been good for ice skates.
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.500]  And then Sandy Alcantara.
[16:43.660 --> 16:46.780]  I need to put one of these packs in the pack sack, so there we go.
[16:47.700 --> 16:49.720]  I feel like we need a name for the Gus sack.
[16:49.860 --> 16:53.420]  I feel like there's a pack sack, but we need something different for the Gus sack.
[16:53.840 --> 16:55.320]  What is sack in Spanish?
[16:55.660 --> 16:56.520]  Bolsa would be bad.
[16:56.520 --> 16:56.940]  Oh, yeah.
[16:57.140 --> 16:58.200]  Bolsa de Gustavo.
[16:58.300 --> 16:59.300]  Bolsa de...
[16:59.300 --> 16:59.600]  Baseball.
[17:00.240 --> 17:01.700]  Oh, Bolsa de Gustavo.
[17:01.940 --> 17:03.320]  Bolsa de Gustavo.
[17:03.820 --> 17:04.760]  Bolsa de Gustavo.
[17:05.080 --> 17:06.180]  Justin Steele, rookie.
[17:06.180 --> 17:07.540]  Matt Olson.
[17:07.680 --> 17:08.310]  Ryan Mountcastle.
[17:08.920 --> 17:09.440]  Good baseball name.
[17:09.520 --> 17:10.200]  Dansby Swanson.
[17:10.380 --> 17:11.780]  Even better baseball name.
[17:13.200 --> 17:15.460]  Oh, that's not a SP, but it looks kind of like it.
[17:15.880 --> 17:16.780]  O'Neal Cruz.
[17:17.100 --> 17:19.080]  There's the parallel again.
[17:20.500 --> 17:21.340]  Brian Rocchio.
[17:21.660 --> 17:22.140]  There you go.
[17:22.360 --> 17:23.060]  Casey Schmidt.
[17:23.860 --> 17:24.700]  Still no...
[17:24.700 --> 17:27.740]  I've opened up one of these boxes at home, and that's how I got those two.
[17:27.900 --> 17:29.300]  So I'm hoping to get two out of this.
[17:30.420 --> 17:33.500]  Or if we're really lucky, we'll get a Christmas sweater.
[17:34.060 --> 17:34.760]  Gus, do you like Christmas?
[17:35.520 --> 17:37.460]  Yeah, Christmas, all right. No complaints here.
[17:37.460 --> 17:39.280]  I'm not, like, overboard about it, but it's fun.
[17:39.520 --> 17:40.260]  Do you decorate for Christmas?
[17:40.880 --> 17:42.320]  Not really. We'll put up a tree. That's about it.
[17:42.640 --> 17:43.320]  Open up a tree?
[17:44.300 --> 17:44.960]  Unfold the tree?
[17:45.200 --> 17:45.420]  Yeah.
[17:46.920 --> 17:48.400]  Yeah, as far as, like, outside, no.
[17:48.560 --> 17:51.000]  A lot of my neighbors go over the top, but I just... I can't.
[17:51.360 --> 17:51.560]  Yeah.
[17:51.820 --> 17:52.900]  It's a lot of work.
[17:53.100 --> 17:53.280]  Yeah.
[17:53.400 --> 17:54.740]  E.J. Abrams.
[17:54.920 --> 17:56.620]  I'm not, like, a Grinch or a Grump about it.
[17:56.660 --> 17:58.260]  No, no, no. Like, you're not anti-Christmas.
[17:58.260 --> 17:59.960]  No, I'm just too lazy. That's me.
[18:00.360 --> 18:01.260]  Do you like Christmas, Geoff?
[18:01.340 --> 18:03.060]  I like Christmas. I don't have a...
[18:03.060 --> 18:06.340]  I mean, I would be a weird relationship to be in with you if I didn't like Christmas.
[18:06.600 --> 18:06.960]  Yeah.
[18:07.280 --> 18:10.340]  I bring a whole storage unit of Christmas.
[18:10.400 --> 18:11.340]  You've been doing this at Christmas.
[18:11.520 --> 18:12.420]  Is Tiny Town out yet?
[18:12.700 --> 18:13.160]  Anthony Volpe.
[18:13.260 --> 18:14.480]  Halloween Tiny Town's out.
[18:15.440 --> 18:17.260]  Mark Finney. There's a lot of rookie cards in this.
[18:17.360 --> 18:17.980]  Joey Weimer.
[18:19.720 --> 18:20.400]  Mason Miller.
[18:20.680 --> 18:21.500]  A lot of dudes I've never heard of.
[18:22.360 --> 18:23.080]  Kibrit Ruiz.
[18:23.180 --> 18:23.920]  That's a different one.
[18:24.540 --> 18:25.140]  That has a border.
[18:25.980 --> 18:26.500]  Oh, the gray one?
[18:26.640 --> 18:26.880]  Yeah.
[18:27.380 --> 18:28.080]  I'm gonna touch it.
[18:28.300 --> 18:28.980]  Wander Franco.
[18:29.300 --> 18:30.480]  Not super popular right now.
[18:31.620 --> 18:32.340]  Nathaniel Lowe.
[18:33.900 --> 18:34.620]  Jared Kalanick.
[18:34.620 --> 18:35.160]  Bobby Miller.
[18:36.700 --> 18:37.420]  Brendan Shawmick.
[18:37.540 --> 18:38.100]  Man, still no...
[18:39.200 --> 18:40.040]  Can you feel?
[18:40.140 --> 18:41.240]  Do they feel different?
[18:43.200 --> 18:44.760]  Or do they do a good job of hiding?
[18:44.880 --> 18:46.980]  Like, if it's a relic, usually it's a thicker one, but...
[18:46.980 --> 18:49.360]  They put fake relics in packs.
[18:49.500 --> 18:49.700]  Really?
[18:51.000 --> 18:51.800]  Yeah, I'll show you.
[18:52.020 --> 18:52.920]  We'll pull one at some point.
[18:52.920 --> 18:53.120]  Okay.
[18:53.620 --> 18:54.480]  Nick Prado rookie.
[18:55.040 --> 18:55.380]  Zach Allen.
[18:55.420 --> 18:56.080]  I'm gonna burn through these.
[18:56.160 --> 18:57.580]  I'm gonna get Augustus cards while we have them.
[18:58.440 --> 18:58.800]  Victor.
[18:58.800 --> 18:59.880]  I just want to...
[18:59.880 --> 19:03.300]  I'm just desperate to get one of these stupid parallels.
[19:04.420 --> 19:06.840]  Bobby Whittaker looks like a fucking doofus there.
[19:07.640 --> 19:09.180]  Gotta figure out how to make money on this!
[19:09.260 --> 19:10.280]  I really want to!
[19:10.300 --> 19:11.220]  Oh, this is the pack right here.
[19:11.220 --> 19:11.720]  I can feel it.
[19:11.760 --> 19:12.300]  This is a good pack.
[19:12.360 --> 19:12.980]  Oh, that's a good one?
[19:13.000 --> 19:13.380]  That's a good pack.
[19:13.460 --> 19:13.800]  I can tell.
[19:14.980 --> 19:15.520]  That's excellent.
[19:15.640 --> 19:16.600]  Your Geoff senses tingling?
[19:16.740 --> 19:16.960]  Yes.
[19:17.060 --> 19:17.120]  Yeah.
[19:18.700 --> 19:19.340]  Igor Rosario.
[19:20.040 --> 19:20.680]  Michael Harris.
[19:20.840 --> 19:21.740]  It's like all rookies.
[19:21.900 --> 19:22.700]  Bo Naylor.
[19:23.920 --> 19:24.560]  Mookie Betts.
[19:24.900 --> 19:25.220]  Boom!
[19:25.420 --> 19:25.900]  There it is!
[19:25.980 --> 19:26.400]  Is that it?
[19:26.400 --> 19:26.900]  Yes, it's on Mookie!
[19:27.340 --> 19:27.720]  Oh, yeah.
[19:28.100 --> 19:28.640]  I didn't even notice.
[19:28.760 --> 19:29.460]  I was just staring at it.
[19:29.640 --> 19:36.620]  So now, you can tell with these, the old school way of telling if it's a parallel or not with
[19:36.620 --> 19:37.660]  tops is fucking annoying.
[19:39.300 --> 19:42.580]  They've changed it in the normal cards, but in these ones, I think they left it.
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.080]  So, if you look at the back here, at the bottom, it'll say...
[19:47.080 --> 19:47.680]  There'll be a number.
[19:47.880 --> 19:48.800]  If it ends in...
[19:48.800 --> 19:50.320]  So, this one ends in 515.
[19:50.660 --> 19:50.900]  Okay.
[19:51.720 --> 19:53.960]  514, 515, and 516 are the parallels.
[19:54.340 --> 19:54.460]  Oh.
[19:54.480 --> 19:55.060]  Or the SP.
[19:56.580 --> 19:56.900]  SP cards.
[19:57.180 --> 19:57.440]  Uh-huh.
[19:57.740 --> 20:02.360]  514 is the least rare, 515 is the middle rare, and 516 is super, super rare.
[20:02.540 --> 20:03.400]  So, this is rare.
[20:03.620 --> 20:03.780]  Okay.
[20:03.780 --> 20:04.420]  This is a really good...
[20:04.420 --> 20:05.580]  This is better than either of these.
[20:05.660 --> 20:06.220]  This is 515.
[20:06.220 --> 20:06.720]  And he does the...
[20:06.720 --> 20:07.640]  My first 515.
[20:07.780 --> 20:08.360]  The dance.
[20:08.660 --> 20:09.840]  Yeah, because he's super, super good.
[20:10.740 --> 20:13.700]  I've never really heard the name Mookie before, except for two people.
[20:14.000 --> 20:15.020]  And they're both baseball players, right?
[20:15.040 --> 20:16.100]  Like, this guy and Mookie Wilson.
[20:16.300 --> 20:17.220]  Mookie Wilson and Mookie Betts.
[20:17.260 --> 20:19.060]  I wonder if Mookie Betts was named after Mookie Wilson.
[20:19.140 --> 20:19.620]  Yeah, it's like...
[20:19.620 --> 20:22.760]  I've only heard that name twice, and they're both in the MLB.
[20:22.760 --> 20:25.980]  And both people named Mookie are really good.
[20:26.140 --> 20:26.260]  Yeah.
[20:26.500 --> 20:28.140]  Like, Mookie Betts is fucking good.
[20:28.280 --> 20:30.660]  James Altman, rookie, parallel, that's cool.
[20:31.020 --> 20:34.260]  Do you think that, like, Tyson Fury, you know, he was named after Mike Tyson?
[20:34.560 --> 20:34.900]  Uh-huh.
[20:35.140 --> 20:36.520]  And then, so...
[20:36.520 --> 20:37.680]  Like, other Tysons?
[20:37.840 --> 20:38.180]  Maybe...
[20:38.180 --> 20:40.260]  Oh, my God, maybe Eric's dog is really good at boxing.
[20:40.900 --> 20:42.240]  I really like Tyson's chicken.
[20:42.480 --> 20:42.720]  Yeah.
[20:43.100 --> 20:44.400]  Yeah, you go one way or the other.
[20:44.940 --> 20:48.580]  If we don't get the parallel in this, that means it was in the pack sack.
[20:48.920 --> 20:49.420]  Oh, no.
[20:50.880 --> 20:51.280]  And...
[20:51.280 --> 20:52.320]  Uh, nope, it's right here.
[20:52.320 --> 20:54.020]  Oh, he peaked.
[20:54.320 --> 20:54.620]  I peaked.
[20:54.900 --> 20:55.160]  Oh, my gosh.
[20:55.200 --> 20:56.460]  I don't know what it is yet, but...
[20:56.460 --> 20:57.560]  Let's see what the...
[20:57.560 --> 20:57.960]  It's back-to-back.
[21:00.560 --> 21:02.680]  Riley Greene, some Christmas spirit there.
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.200]  Shintaro Fujinami, rookie.
[21:05.460 --> 21:05.980]  Oscar Gonzalez.
[21:06.220 --> 21:07.260]  Goddamn, there's a lot of rookies.
[21:07.400 --> 21:08.000]  Tristan Case.
[21:08.320 --> 21:08.820]  That's fun.
[21:09.020 --> 21:09.940]  Bo Bichette again.
[21:12.000 --> 21:12.800]  Sterling Marta.
[21:12.980 --> 21:13.560]  Luis Castillo.
[21:13.720 --> 21:14.460]  Vernon Simeon.
[21:14.620 --> 21:15.380]  Brent Wisely.
[21:15.820 --> 21:16.780]  Christopher Morrill.
[21:18.100 --> 21:18.860]  Estrella Ruiz.
[21:18.940 --> 21:19.520]  Okay, here we go.
[21:20.240 --> 21:25.100]  Rhett Beatty, player-worn memorabilia rookie card.
[21:25.220 --> 21:25.900]  That's cool.
[21:26.800 --> 21:29.840]  You've received a relic card from 23 Tops Mega Baseball.
[21:30.320 --> 21:33.360]  The relic contained in this card was worn by the featured player.
[21:33.840 --> 21:38.000]  The execution of all player-worn memorabilia is witnessed by Tops representative to guarantee authenticity.
[21:38.180 --> 21:39.240]  So, this is player-worn.
[21:39.360 --> 21:39.760]  Dang.
[21:39.820 --> 21:40.620]  And this is rookie card.
[21:40.620 --> 21:42.940]  Do you think it's jersey or is it like that sleeve thing he's wearing?
[21:43.140 --> 21:43.720]  Looks like a sleeve.
[21:43.980 --> 21:44.660]  It could be either.
[21:44.920 --> 21:45.460]  It really could.
[21:45.620 --> 21:45.760]  I don't know.
[21:45.780 --> 21:46.740]  What do you know about him?
[21:47.260 --> 21:47.620]  Uh, nothing.
[21:47.620 --> 21:48.140]  Okay.
[21:48.440 --> 21:49.180]  Plays for the Mets?
[21:49.340 --> 21:49.900]  Plays for the Mets.
[21:50.100 --> 21:51.460]  I don't know shit about baseball anymore.
[21:51.500 --> 21:52.580]  Patrick Bailey, not much.
[21:52.660 --> 21:54.120]  It's so hard to keep up with so many.
[21:54.380 --> 21:57.680]  Well, and it's basketball has consumed so much of my brain.
[21:58.000 --> 21:58.160]  Yeah.
[21:58.240 --> 21:59.220]  That it's hard to find rooms.
[21:59.720 --> 22:00.360]  Jazz Chisholm.
[22:00.480 --> 22:00.960]  Don't be so lazy.
[22:01.380 --> 22:02.800]  Easy Jazz Chisholm, Clayton Kershaw.
[22:03.140 --> 22:06.060]  Okay, I know that Clayton Kershaw should probably retire if he didn't already.
[22:06.860 --> 22:07.720]  Um, okay.
[22:08.480 --> 22:09.220]  Well, that was that.
[22:09.300 --> 22:11.260]  Let's dive into Gus card.
[22:11.380 --> 22:11.440]  Yay.
[22:11.440 --> 22:12.700]  Let's rewind time a little bit.
[22:12.940 --> 22:14.820]  These eventually need to be sleeved.
[22:14.860 --> 22:15.360]  Oh my gosh.
[22:15.360 --> 22:16.500]  I should've been here the whole time.
[22:16.560 --> 22:17.420]  I've just been sitting here.
[22:18.160 --> 22:18.820]  Uh, let me see.
[22:18.900 --> 22:20.420]  I got some good spooky music for...
[22:24.580 --> 22:25.260]  What do you want?
[22:25.340 --> 22:26.480]  Like, bringing out from the past.
[22:26.580 --> 22:28.040]  We got some 1990 flair.
[22:28.240 --> 22:29.220]  Yeah, just grab handfuls.
[22:29.260 --> 22:29.940]  We'll open all that shit.
[22:30.100 --> 22:30.360]  We got a...
[22:33.080 --> 22:33.720]  89 Bowman.
[22:34.080 --> 22:34.540]  That's good.
[22:35.540 --> 22:36.580]  Here, we'll just start with this.
[22:37.720 --> 22:38.200]  That's great.
[22:38.340 --> 22:42.960]  And like last time, Gus, what we're gonna do is we're gonna go through and we're just gonna try to find the cards with the most value.
[22:42.960 --> 22:46.040]  And then, uh, figure out what they're worth.
[22:46.140 --> 22:47.120]  We're not eating any more gum.
[22:47.740 --> 22:48.680]  No, we're done with the gum.
[22:48.880 --> 22:49.740]  You already got...
[22:50.600 --> 22:51.880]  You had your rite of passage.
[22:52.820 --> 22:53.540]  1990 flair.
[22:53.920 --> 22:56.940]  And we had some really good cards that we pulled last time, Gus, that we graded.
[22:56.980 --> 22:58.420]  I don't know if you were here for the grading episode.
[22:58.520 --> 22:58.940]  I was not.
[22:59.480 --> 23:00.820]  Some of them had some money.
[23:01.080 --> 23:02.260]  Is that where we got the Mark McGuire?
[23:02.540 --> 23:03.800]  No, the Mark McGuire came later.
[23:04.140 --> 23:05.420]  Which you did what with it today?
[23:05.980 --> 23:06.340]  I...
[23:06.340 --> 23:10.620]  So, I got a 1985 Mark McGuire Olympic Rookie, Tops Rookie card.
[23:10.740 --> 23:11.500]  It was like the...
[23:11.500 --> 23:12.620]  Yeah, I remember that card.
[23:13.020 --> 23:15.160]  I pulled one just from a random pack the other day.
[23:15.300 --> 23:18.280]  And so I decided that would be the first card I ever submit to PSA.
[23:18.400 --> 23:20.060]  And then talk about the process and everything.
[23:20.160 --> 23:22.340]  So I explained how I was gonna do it to the audience.
[23:22.480 --> 23:23.960]  And then today, I sent it off.
[23:24.180 --> 23:24.920]  I sent off...
[23:24.920 --> 23:25.580]  I sent that off.
[23:25.620 --> 23:27.080]  I sent Emily's Jet Ski card.
[23:27.300 --> 23:28.940]  And then I sent off a card I haven't talked about.
[23:29.060 --> 23:29.800]  But I have a...
[23:29.800 --> 23:30.780]  I got a while back.
[23:30.860 --> 23:32.920]  I acquired a Larry Bird Magic Johnson Rookie.
[23:34.460 --> 23:35.180]  That's, uh...
[23:35.180 --> 23:36.240]  That's a triple dipper card.
[23:36.260 --> 23:39.600]  I'm like 90% sure it's legitimate.
[23:39.800 --> 23:40.460]  But we're gonna find out.
[23:40.480 --> 23:40.780]  Okay.
[23:40.780 --> 23:41.520]  We're gonna find out.
[23:41.620 --> 23:43.880]  And we got that one at, like, a garage sale.
[23:44.340 --> 23:44.520]  Yeah.
[23:44.740 --> 23:45.680]  So hopefully it's real.
[23:45.740 --> 23:46.760]  If it's real, it's worth a lot.
[23:46.860 --> 23:48.600]  If it's not, then I, uh...
[23:48.600 --> 23:49.200]  Then you're a fool.
[23:49.300 --> 23:49.400]  Yeah.
[23:50.120 --> 23:53.780]  Uh, Jim Corsi, Tim Wallach, Ray Siraj...
[23:54.480 --> 23:55.840]  His hat looks photoshopped on.
[23:55.940 --> 23:57.040]  It does not look like he's wearing that hat.
[23:57.120 --> 23:57.940]  He doesn't know how to wear a hat.
[23:57.960 --> 23:58.820]  It looks like a trucker's hat.
[23:59.320 --> 24:00.420]  Uh, Mitch Webster.
[24:00.540 --> 24:04.680]  Turn back the hands of time to 1990 when Gus was...
[24:04.680 --> 24:05.160]  I was 12.
[24:05.440 --> 24:06.560]  12 years old.
[24:06.600 --> 24:09.260]  And he goes to the local Eagle Pass Walmart.
[24:09.260 --> 24:12.600]  And he sees all of these cards in a shopping, uh, container.
[24:12.740 --> 24:13.880]  And says, someday I'm gonna...
[24:13.880 --> 24:16.760]  I'm gonna befriend a scrawny kid with tattoos...
[24:16.760 --> 24:20.880]  ...who's gonna not tell me that he's into baseball cards for a very long time throughout our friendship.
[24:21.020 --> 24:21.820]  And then I'll find out.
[24:21.880 --> 24:25.540]  And then one day we'll open it on camera on a show that doesn't exist yet.
[24:25.540 --> 24:26.220]  On something called Internet, which doesn't exist.
[24:26.220 --> 24:27.720]  On a medium that doesn't exist yet.
[24:27.940 --> 24:28.040]  Yeah.
[24:29.280 --> 24:30.080]  Kurt Manwary.
[24:30.180 --> 24:30.560]  That's a serious start.
[24:30.560 --> 24:31.100]  Tony Pena.
[24:31.360 --> 24:32.480]  Gus has had these in his possession.
[24:32.500 --> 24:33.080]  Wait, what was before that?
[24:33.160 --> 24:33.660]  What was before Tony Pena?
[24:33.660 --> 24:34.100]  Kurt Manwary.
[24:35.100 --> 24:35.500]  Manuary?
[24:35.740 --> 24:36.660]  Kurt Manwary.
[24:36.720 --> 24:37.200]  Oh, man.
[24:37.200 --> 24:38.000]  Manuary.
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.220]  What month is that?
[24:39.560 --> 24:40.020]  Manuary?
[24:40.580 --> 24:41.760]  What's man month?
[24:42.280 --> 24:43.040]  Joe Bover.
[24:43.360 --> 24:44.400]  Jim Clancy.
[24:44.940 --> 24:45.940]  Ken Patterson.
[24:46.160 --> 24:46.320]  That's a...
[24:46.320 --> 24:47.040]  Dude, that's a lame...
[24:47.040 --> 24:47.680]  That's a sup.
[24:48.020 --> 24:48.500]  That's a sup.
[24:48.540 --> 24:49.400]  That's a sup.
[24:49.440 --> 24:50.160]  Ed Whitson.
[24:50.320 --> 24:51.260]  Roberto Kelly.
[24:51.900 --> 24:52.400]  Rick Aguilera.
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.000]  Doyle Alexander.
[24:55.440 --> 24:55.720]  Doyle.
[24:55.860 --> 24:56.260]  Doyle.
[24:56.940 --> 24:57.880]  Tom Gordon.
[24:58.060 --> 24:58.840]  Danny Jackson.
[24:59.140 --> 24:59.640]  Rick Reed.
[24:59.780 --> 25:01.160]  And a Phillies sticker.
[25:01.400 --> 25:01.880]  Oh, cool.
[25:02.020 --> 25:02.640]  In honor of...
[25:02.640 --> 25:03.980]  You should get that to, uh, to Nick.
[25:04.260 --> 25:04.540]  Yeah.
[25:04.660 --> 25:05.580]  In honor of...
[25:05.580 --> 25:06.120]  Oh, boy.
[25:07.580 --> 25:08.160]  Oh, boy.
[25:08.640 --> 25:11.520]  Is the adhesive, uh, long gone?
[25:11.780 --> 25:12.960]  Yeah, I think it...
[25:12.960 --> 25:13.980]  It's permanent now?
[25:14.120 --> 25:15.460]  Yeah, it's not a sticker anymore.
[25:16.100 --> 25:17.340]  Uh, let's open up some of these Bowman cards.
[25:17.440 --> 25:18.420]  Man, these are hard to find.
[25:18.620 --> 25:18.840]  1989 Bowman.
[25:19.260 --> 25:19.900]  1989 Bowman.
[25:19.960 --> 25:21.040]  These were hard to find when I was a kid.
[25:21.140 --> 25:23.080]  I very rarely ever got the opportunity to open them.
[25:23.200 --> 25:25.340]  Even when I was a kid, nobody liked those, though.
[25:25.760 --> 25:27.260]  Well, they're odd size, right?
[25:27.340 --> 25:29.180]  These ones specifically, they're oversized, which is annoying.
[25:29.440 --> 25:29.720]  They're too big?
[25:29.840 --> 25:30.680]  Raphael Palmeiro.
[25:31.300 --> 25:32.300]  Yeah, they are, uh...
[25:32.300 --> 25:32.860]  I saw him play.
[25:33.260 --> 25:34.040]  He was very good.
[25:34.220 --> 25:34.500]  Very good.
[25:34.500 --> 25:35.400]  Did you see him play with the Rangers?
[25:36.540 --> 25:38.400]  How many Rangers games did you go to when you were a kid?
[25:38.420 --> 25:39.360]  I've only been to...
[25:39.360 --> 25:41.180]  When I was a kid, I only went to, like, three Rangers games.
[25:41.260 --> 25:42.320]  I went to more Astros games.
[25:42.420 --> 25:44.180]  It was easier for me to get to Houston than to Dallas.
[25:44.380 --> 25:45.300]  Dallas was a further drive.
[25:45.460 --> 25:46.960]  How often would you guys go to Astros games?
[25:47.140 --> 25:49.800]  Oh, man, I probably only went to ten when I was a kid.
[25:49.920 --> 25:50.560]  Like, not even one a year.
[25:50.580 --> 25:51.400]  Was that at the Astrodome?
[25:51.540 --> 25:51.780]  Yeah.
[25:52.180 --> 25:52.600]  How about you?
[25:52.940 --> 25:57.480]  I only ever saw them at Enron Field, uh, before they had to change the name.
[25:57.620 --> 26:00.900]  But I think we've gone to a few, not many.
[26:00.980 --> 26:02.140]  We went more to the rodeo.
[26:02.140 --> 26:05.040]  Like, my dad worked, he was in purchasing,
[26:05.300 --> 26:09.400]  and so he always got free passes and sweets to, with oil companies
[26:09.400 --> 26:11.080]  that would give us that stuff for free.
[26:11.160 --> 26:11.840]  But we've been.
[26:12.380 --> 26:13.920]  I'll go to any sporting event for the food.
[26:14.620 --> 26:15.340]  Yeah, same.
[26:15.720 --> 26:16.820]  I've never seen the Astros.
[26:17.020 --> 26:20.060]  We did more at, living in Bakersfield when we were really little
[26:20.060 --> 26:22.400]  was the Dodgers, like, farm team.
[26:22.480 --> 26:27.640]  So we would go see, uh, Pedro Martinez whenever he was out there, right?
[26:27.860 --> 26:28.920]  Didn't we look that up or something?
[26:29.060 --> 26:29.260]  I think we did, yeah.
[26:29.260 --> 26:30.660]  Whenever he was at the Bakersfield Dodgers.
[26:30.880 --> 26:31.060]  Yeah.
[26:32.400 --> 26:33.660]  Oh, here's something funny.
[26:33.740 --> 26:36.620]  There's our old pal Doyle Alexander again.
[26:36.620 --> 26:38.060]  Oh, we just saw you, dude.
[26:38.180 --> 26:39.360]  That is a face.
[26:39.840 --> 26:43.560]  I'm being, I'm getting the idea that the universe wants us to collect
[26:43.560 --> 26:44.820]  Doyle Alexander cards.
[26:45.800 --> 26:46.660]  Doyle rules.
[26:47.040 --> 26:47.820]  Doyle rules.
[26:48.220 --> 26:48.520]  Doyle rules.
[26:48.540 --> 26:50.020]  Yeah, we're gonna be Doyle stans.
[26:51.680 --> 26:55.560]  Jim Clancy, no relation to Tom, that I'm aware of.
[26:55.600 --> 26:58.880]  Dave Schmidt, no relation to Tom, that I'm aware of.
[26:59.740 --> 27:00.540]  Bill Schroeder.
[27:01.080 --> 27:02.360]  No relation to Dennis Schroeder.
[27:02.840 --> 27:04.460]  Oh, that's like a throwback card or something?
[27:04.740 --> 27:06.960]  Yeah, it's actually a checklist card, or a...
[27:08.520 --> 27:09.040]  That's weird.
[27:09.040 --> 27:10.340]  You can enter a sweepstakes with it.
[27:10.580 --> 27:11.380]  Oh, I could have won!
[27:11.720 --> 27:12.520]  You should have.
[27:12.620 --> 27:14.400]  Every one of these packs had one of those in it.
[27:15.140 --> 27:15.940]  Ron Hassey.
[27:16.420 --> 27:17.300]  Oh, here we go.
[27:17.380 --> 27:18.120]  This is a good card.
[27:18.260 --> 27:20.180]  Oral Herschizer, we'll save that.
[27:21.340 --> 27:23.760]  Will Clark, that's probably worth saving too.
[27:24.400 --> 27:25.000]  Check up on that.
[27:25.740 --> 27:26.500]  Al Sitzer.
[27:27.320 --> 27:28.120]  Oh, wait, sorry.
[27:28.120 --> 27:29.160]  He looks 12.
[27:29.360 --> 27:30.380]  Al Sitzer, Al Leiter.
[27:30.780 --> 27:31.740]  That was Al Leiter, sorry.
[27:32.380 --> 27:33.360]  Yeah, he's 14.
[27:33.840 --> 27:34.280]  Like Doogie.
[27:35.560 --> 27:36.860]  Here's John Cerruti.
[27:39.160 --> 27:39.880]  Looking overexposed.
[27:39.940 --> 27:42.460]  We want you looking straight into the sun for your photo.
[27:42.800 --> 27:43.760]  But keep your eyes open.
[27:44.580 --> 27:44.780]  Good.
[27:45.500 --> 27:46.380]  He's like, are you sure?
[27:46.440 --> 27:48.980]  And they're like, yeah, do it just like your teammate Geoff Muselman did.
[27:49.680 --> 27:50.360]  Both of them.
[27:50.800 --> 27:52.300]  They took those on the same day, didn't they?
[27:52.300 --> 27:53.200]  Yeah, they absolutely did.
[27:53.460 --> 27:56.420]  There's one day a year where they go and they take all the photos, I think.
[27:56.880 --> 27:57.500]  Poor team.
[27:58.240 --> 27:59.360]  That bit, that's fascinating.
[27:59.500 --> 28:00.020]  I'd love to see that.
[28:00.140 --> 28:05.160]  I watched a little documentary about it on, I think YouTube maybe?
[28:05.420 --> 28:05.700]  Uh-huh.
[28:05.780 --> 28:07.160]  Like Tops TV put it out.
[28:07.540 --> 28:09.440]  Melito Perez, I've never heard of.
[28:09.580 --> 28:10.820]  Tracy Jones.
[28:12.120 --> 28:13.340]  Oh, Kirby Puckett.
[28:13.460 --> 28:14.540]  Love Kirby Puckett.
[28:17.160 --> 28:17.960]  Larry McWilliams.
[28:17.980 --> 28:18.840]  That's a great mustache.
[28:18.920 --> 28:19.580]  That is, that's it.
[28:19.640 --> 28:20.640]  That's a Philadelphia mustache.
[28:20.860 --> 28:22.080]  Let me get that Philly stache.
[28:23.860 --> 28:24.540]  Get over here.
[28:24.560 --> 28:24.880]  There you go.
[28:24.880 --> 28:26.860]  Tom Fisher.
[28:29.220 --> 28:31.260]  What is that on his cheek?
[28:31.520 --> 28:32.120]  I don't know what I think about that.
[28:32.500 --> 28:34.420]  Is that on the card or on his face?
[28:34.520 --> 28:35.440]  I think it's on his face.
[28:35.900 --> 28:36.900]  Maybe it's like a little birthmark?
[28:37.180 --> 28:40.880]  These have been climate controlled for 30 years, these cards.
[28:42.620 --> 28:43.600]  Donald Nixon.
[28:44.320 --> 28:45.020]  Oh, here you go.
[28:45.080 --> 28:46.720]  There's one of those sweepstakes cards for Ted Williams.
[28:46.900 --> 28:47.100]  Oh.
[28:48.280 --> 28:50.740]  You know someone is selling that for too much.
[28:50.820 --> 28:51.280]  Little Known Player.
[28:51.720 --> 28:54.560]  Little Known Player obsessed with living forever.
[28:55.700 --> 28:56.560]  Had his head preserved.
[28:57.540 --> 28:58.280]  Did he really, though?
[28:58.640 --> 28:59.620]  Yeah, I think so.
[29:00.120 --> 29:02.020]  I think he's cryogenically frozen.
[29:02.200 --> 29:03.040]  Just his head, though.
[29:03.080 --> 29:03.780]  I think it's just his head.
[29:03.840 --> 29:05.020]  He futuromed it.
[29:05.140 --> 29:06.120]  Yeah, I think he futuromed it.
[29:06.560 --> 29:08.140]  Before it was cool, yeah.
[29:08.340 --> 29:08.680]  Well, okay.
[29:08.740 --> 29:09.660]  He was like an early one doing it.
[29:09.680 --> 29:10.100]  Eric Davis.
[29:10.200 --> 29:10.780]  I could be wrong about that.
[29:10.780 --> 29:11.560]  Him and Walt Disney, right?
[29:11.780 --> 29:14.020]  Yeah, who's going to prove me wrong?
[29:14.360 --> 29:15.960]  When do we get to find out if it works?
[29:16.260 --> 29:16.900]  Tim Laudner.
[29:17.020 --> 29:19.360]  Whenever the technology happens to either bring him back or not.
[29:19.380 --> 29:20.020]  Are we close?
[29:20.400 --> 29:21.060]  Well, that's the thing.
[29:21.060 --> 29:27.100]  You also have to hope that when the technology gets there that anybody's around that wants you back.
[29:27.260 --> 29:29.060]  Or that he's going to even understand.
[29:29.400 --> 29:30.340]  He's going to...
[29:30.340 --> 29:31.620]  Could you imagine coming back to life?
[29:32.380 --> 29:33.020]  Spoiler alert.
[29:33.460 --> 29:36.360]  This is all that Vanilla Sky was about.
[29:36.640 --> 29:36.920]  Really?
[29:37.380 --> 29:38.300]  Yeah, it was the whole thing.
[29:38.920 --> 29:41.060]  And then he finally wakes up in the future and they're like...
[29:42.200 --> 29:43.440]  The world's changed a lot.
[29:43.860 --> 29:45.520]  You don't have as much money as you think you did.
[29:46.520 --> 29:50.420]  Whenever I hear good vibrations, I just think of Tom Cruise screaming tech support at the top of his lungs.
[29:51.060 --> 29:53.720]  That movie has left an indelible mark in my brain.
[29:54.240 --> 29:56.040]  It probably hit you at just the right time in your life.
[29:57.320 --> 29:58.200]  Charlie Liebrandt.
[29:58.200 --> 29:59.700]  Barry Larkin.
[30:01.020 --> 30:02.380]  I think we got another sup.
[30:02.660 --> 30:03.420]  Eric Chou.
[30:05.160 --> 30:06.000]  That is...
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.260]  You know, that's not sup, that's Pussy Slay.
[30:08.540 --> 30:09.460]  Oh, is that Pussy Slay?
[30:09.680 --> 30:10.680]  In honor of Gus.
[30:10.880 --> 30:11.220]  Wow.
[30:11.560 --> 30:13.040]  Is he showing you the gun show?
[30:14.360 --> 30:14.800]  Yeah.
[30:15.360 --> 30:17.500]  What's up with another pack of these ugly-ass Bowmans?
[30:17.860 --> 30:21.660]  This card of the Pussy Slay is like, we've got it pretty filled out nicely.
[30:21.860 --> 30:22.720]  Dude, look at that.
[30:22.920 --> 30:24.000]  Stop, I'm on camera.
[30:25.620 --> 30:28.340]  I love it.
[30:29.100 --> 30:30.080]  Oh, that's great.
[30:31.880 --> 30:33.580]  Our Pussy Slay collection is getting...
[30:33.580 --> 30:36.600]  At some point we'll call it completed for 2023 and then we'll...
[30:37.440 --> 30:38.200]  I don't know, maybe we'll like...
[30:38.200 --> 30:39.360]  I was trying to figure out what to do with these.
[30:39.440 --> 30:43.860]  Maybe we'll compile them and just throw them in orders randomly and people buy fuck-faced stuff.
[30:44.000 --> 30:44.240]  Yeah.
[30:44.240 --> 30:47.400]  Or maybe there'd be some way to auction them off or sell them.
[30:47.500 --> 30:47.840]  I don't know.
[30:47.900 --> 30:49.120]  We've got to figure out a way to...
[30:49.120 --> 30:51.040]  There's so much stuff.
[30:51.160 --> 30:53.840]  I love including this stuff in as little extras in orders.
[30:54.080 --> 30:58.980]  Yeah, I know that there's always the question of the legality of purchase with whatever.
[30:59.400 --> 31:00.720]  But it's not really a free gift.
[31:01.440 --> 31:02.940]  Businesses throw stickers in all the time.
[31:03.060 --> 31:06.920]  And this, as we've learned, that the stuff, even that we think has value, is a dollar.
[31:07.180 --> 31:08.160]  Yeah, none of it's worth anything.
[31:09.460 --> 31:10.840]  I mean in the traditional sense.
[31:10.860 --> 31:11.560]  It's worth a lot to me.
[31:12.040 --> 31:12.980]  Greg Swindell.
[31:14.740 --> 31:15.460]  Mark Lewis.
[31:16.140 --> 31:16.860]  Claudel Washington.
[31:18.700 --> 31:19.420]  Dave Gallagher.
[31:21.280 --> 31:22.000]  Bob Brower.
[31:23.740 --> 31:24.460]  Sid Fernandez.
[31:25.820 --> 31:26.540]  Duke Snyder.
[31:27.320 --> 31:28.680]  Do you know any of these people, really?
[31:28.920 --> 31:30.400]  Do they remind you of Ring of Bell?
[31:30.400 --> 31:31.400]  These names do not ring a bell for me.
[31:31.440 --> 31:33.660]  I was really big into baseball around this time.
[31:34.580 --> 31:35.620]  None of these really ring a bell.
[31:35.820 --> 31:37.020]  I know probably half of them.
[31:37.080 --> 31:37.320]  Really?
[31:37.500 --> 31:37.680]  Yeah.
[31:37.880 --> 31:39.520]  Like this guy right here, Ozzy Guillen.
[31:39.800 --> 31:40.620]  Oh, I do know Ozzy Guillen.
[31:40.620 --> 31:44.740]  He coached the White Sox the year they won the World Series in 2005.
[31:45.240 --> 31:46.620]  I saw the other teams.
[31:48.160 --> 31:49.500]  You did, I remember that.
[31:49.720 --> 31:51.360]  Jim Presley, you went down to Houston, right?
[31:51.440 --> 31:54.600]  Yeah, I happened to be in Chicago for one game and then I went down to Houston for the other.
[31:54.940 --> 31:55.220]  Nice.
[31:55.460 --> 31:55.940]  Gerald Perry.
[31:56.940 --> 31:59.140]  Fernando Valenzuela was one of my favorite pitchers when I was a kid.
[31:59.260 --> 31:59.820]  That's signed.
[32:01.340 --> 32:02.800]  They're all quote-unquote signed.
[32:02.900 --> 32:03.720]  And then Darryl Strawberry.
[32:04.280 --> 32:05.800]  Oh, he has a good signature.
[32:06.820 --> 32:08.160]  He did a lot of drugs.
[32:08.160 --> 32:11.460]  Before you open another one of those, I've got some other alternatives for you here.
[32:11.540 --> 32:11.980]  Yeah, let's do it.
[32:11.980 --> 32:12.860]  I've got some Donruss.
[32:12.960 --> 32:19.860]  And I noticed that these packs have two different stickers in the upper right are two different things that they're advertising.
[32:20.520 --> 32:22.700]  One of them says, win instantly over one million prizes.
[32:22.820 --> 32:25.380]  And the other one says, collect all 26 MVP bonus cards.
[32:25.600 --> 32:26.780]  Yeah, I wonder what the difference is.
[32:26.820 --> 32:28.020]  This one says, see back for details.
[32:28.100 --> 32:28.560]  That one doesn't.
[32:28.600 --> 32:29.140]  Same year.
[32:29.360 --> 32:30.460]  It's really weird.
[32:30.640 --> 32:34.520]  And the one that says the MVP, that's the only one I can see like that in my box.
[32:34.620 --> 32:36.480]  I've been trying to move it around for some more.
[32:36.680 --> 32:40.100]  What do you think makes it, do you think it has something special in it?
[32:40.100 --> 32:43.020]  They were probably at different times in the print run.
[32:43.200 --> 32:46.060]  So it wouldn't, it would matter for errors.
[32:46.260 --> 32:46.560]  Okay.
[32:46.680 --> 32:46.980]  Probably.
[32:47.240 --> 32:47.800]  Here's another MVP.
[32:48.100 --> 32:49.380]  If there were errors.
[32:49.600 --> 32:53.260]  But yeah, the overwhelming majority of the ones I have do not say MVP on them.
[32:53.360 --> 32:55.160]  So this, I'm going to keep them separated.
[32:55.320 --> 32:57.620]  So this is the MVP pack right here.
[32:57.920 --> 32:59.660]  Was there anything of value this year?
[32:59.800 --> 33:01.700]  Or does Donruss ever really have anything of value?
[33:01.720 --> 33:04.500]  Yes, there was valuable stuff that we pulled last time with Gus.
[33:04.680 --> 33:06.060]  Oh, with the Donruss ones?
[33:06.060 --> 33:08.440]  Oh yeah, these cards, I remember them.
[33:08.860 --> 33:09.640]  Alright, so let's do...
[33:09.640 --> 33:10.680]  Remember how ugly they are?
[33:10.920 --> 33:11.660]  Yeah, they're pretty ugly.
[33:11.780 --> 33:13.060]  Let's do these guys first.
[33:14.480 --> 33:14.920]  Uh...
[33:14.920 --> 33:15.860]  Paul Kilgur.
[33:16.680 --> 33:17.120]  What?!
[33:17.120 --> 33:17.600]  Was that good?
[33:18.340 --> 33:18.780]  Kilgus?
[33:19.500 --> 33:19.940]  Paul...
[33:19.940 --> 33:21.200]  Oh, it is Kilgus!
[33:21.880 --> 33:23.240]  I do not like that guy.
[33:23.280 --> 33:25.640]  Oh my God, it was a first card!
[33:26.120 --> 33:26.560]  Wow.
[33:26.860 --> 33:28.100]  Paul Kilgus!
[33:28.180 --> 33:29.840]  I read it as Kilgur, you're right!
[33:30.200 --> 33:31.760]  That dude hates you.
[33:31.760 --> 33:33.300]  That's spooky, it's Halloween time.
[33:33.740 --> 33:34.140]  I don't like that.
[33:34.140 --> 33:34.920]  Let's save that.
[33:34.920 --> 33:35.800]  No, let's not.
[33:36.180 --> 33:36.660]  Whoa!
[33:38.020 --> 33:39.340]  Did you know there was a guy with that name?
[33:39.340 --> 33:39.660]  No!
[33:40.100 --> 33:41.020]  I have no idea.
[33:42.940 --> 33:43.900]  Like it's...
[33:43.900 --> 33:47.740]  Every pack I could have pulled from here, that one comes out first from the Donruss?
[33:48.240 --> 33:52.880]  Dude, Mickey Tennleton, Howard Johnson, Bobby Bonilla, Steve Sachs.
[33:53.980 --> 33:56.240]  He threw baseballs that hit people all the time.
[33:57.300 --> 33:58.160]  Tony Pena.
[33:58.760 --> 33:59.660]  Dennis Lamp.
[33:59.760 --> 34:00.380]  Name is a thing.
[34:02.720 --> 34:03.200]  Uh...
[34:04.400 --> 34:10.440]  Tim Bertsess, Franklin Stubbs, Tony Fernandez, Joey Bell, Randy Villarde, Mike Fetter rookie, nothing.
[34:10.820 --> 34:11.980]  Pat Combs rookie, nothing.
[34:12.080 --> 34:13.640]  Rob Deere, name is an animal.
[34:14.100 --> 34:14.400]  Oh yeah.
[34:15.460 --> 34:16.340]  Steve Bedrosian.
[34:17.020 --> 34:17.940]  Got a puzzle piece.
[34:18.160 --> 34:19.060]  Let's put the puzzle together.
[34:19.440 --> 34:20.680]  Alright, let's see the MVP one.
[34:20.840 --> 34:21.560]  Let's see if we get another...
[34:21.560 --> 34:21.820]  Someone's shoulder.
[34:22.080 --> 34:22.520]  What was his name?
[34:23.060 --> 34:23.740]  Paul Kilgus?
[34:23.860 --> 34:24.540]  Paul Kilgus.
[34:24.660 --> 34:25.780]  Paul, do not listen to him.
[34:26.320 --> 34:26.760]  Paul...
[34:27.660 --> 34:30.200]  Alright, we got Juan Baranguer.
[34:31.120 --> 34:31.500]  But what?
[34:32.300 --> 34:32.740]  Baranguer?
[34:32.740 --> 34:34.320]  What was one of our...
[34:34.320 --> 34:35.360]  Baranguer, yeah.
[34:36.080 --> 34:42.760]  Dave Bergman, Pete O'Brien, Ricky Horton, Dwayne Ward, Pedro Guerrero, love Pedro Guerrero.
[34:43.260 --> 34:45.660]  Geoff Petarek, Mickey Sasser...
[34:45.660 --> 34:46.500]  Mackie Sasser, sorry.
[34:46.660 --> 34:48.060]  Kirby Puckett, MVP card.
[34:48.220 --> 34:48.980]  Rene Gonzalez.
[34:49.520 --> 34:50.640]  John Kruk.
[34:51.040 --> 34:51.400]  Oh yeah.
[34:51.660 --> 34:54.340]  He's a lovable baseball character.
[34:56.280 --> 35:02.720]  Gerald Perry, Don August, Mickey Hatcher, Alfredo Griffin, and Harold Baines, all-star card.
[35:03.060 --> 35:06.380]  So I didn't see anything different except for one of the packs is clearly trying to kill you.
[35:06.680 --> 35:06.740]  Yeah.
[35:07.420 --> 35:10.020]  And then one other weirdo thing I found in here.
[35:10.740 --> 35:14.140]  You know, we had a lot of those packs that were like the gum.
[35:14.300 --> 35:15.380]  Yeah, I think we gave...
[35:15.380 --> 35:16.420]  We gave one of those away.
[35:16.960 --> 35:18.120]  I've got these collector books.
[35:18.180 --> 35:20.080]  I think we opened one of these collector books last time.
[35:20.080 --> 35:25.220]  But in there I found this 1987 Fleer Baseball's Game Winners.
[35:25.400 --> 35:25.780]  Oh.
[35:25.940 --> 35:27.080]  I don't know what that is.
[35:28.580 --> 35:29.640]  Let's find out.
[35:29.720 --> 35:32.240]  Oh, we've been saving all of the...
[35:32.240 --> 35:36.100]  We got Gus last time, so now we'll put Kill Gus next to him.
[35:36.840 --> 35:40.820]  Oh, it's like a little set of 44 cards.
[35:40.920 --> 35:42.240]  I've never heard of these before.
[35:42.860 --> 35:46.100]  Let's see, they're 87 Fleer, limited edition.
[35:46.100 --> 35:58.340]  We've got Harold Baines, Don Baylor, George Bell, Tony Bernardzard, Wade Boggs, Boss Hogg, George Brett, Hubie Brooks, looking cute, Jose Canseco.
[35:58.560 --> 35:59.440]  We should look that up.
[35:59.440 --> 36:00.860]  These are all like known players.
[36:01.380 --> 36:03.800]  Yeah, no, these are Roger Clemens, Eric Davis.
[36:03.860 --> 36:05.680]  I imagine there's going to be a McGuire in here.
[36:05.680 --> 36:16.420]  Glenn Davis, Sean Dunstan, Mark Eichhorn, Gary Gaietti, Steve Garvey, who is about to be featured very heavily in this week's So All Right.
[36:17.040 --> 36:21.180]  Kirk Gibson, Dwight Dock Gooden, Vaughn Hayes, Willie Hernandez.
[36:21.260 --> 36:22.260]  This is an awesome little set.
[36:22.360 --> 36:25.100]  Teddy O'Gara, Wally Joyner, looks like he's about four.
[36:25.620 --> 36:34.460]  Bob Knepper, Mike Kruko, Geoff Leonard, Don Mattingly, Kurt McCaskill, Kevin McReynolds, Jim Morrison.
[36:36.120 --> 36:37.520]  He sang in a band, right?
[36:37.560 --> 36:38.240]  He was a rock star, yeah.
[36:38.540 --> 36:40.900]  Dale Murphy, Pete O'Brien. I'm going to keep these.
[36:41.040 --> 36:43.080]  Was that Dale Murphy uniform? What was that?
[36:44.040 --> 36:45.900]  That was like the...
[36:45.900 --> 36:47.320]  He had like a weight on his back.
[36:47.320 --> 36:48.080]  An old Braves uniform?
[36:48.160 --> 36:48.940]  Yeah, it's a Braves uniform.
[36:50.300 --> 36:55.760]  Bob O'Heda, Larry Parrish, Ken Phelps, Dennis Rasmussen, Ernie Riles, Cal Ripken Jr.
[36:55.800 --> 36:57.080]  That's probably the one worth the most here.
[36:57.460 --> 37:02.700]  Ron Robinson, Steve Sachs, Mike Schmidt, John Tudor, Fernando Valenzuela.
[37:02.860 --> 37:03.260]  Look at that.
[37:03.260 --> 37:04.620]  A few repeats here.
[37:04.800 --> 37:06.180]  Not like the same card, but the same people.
[37:06.420 --> 37:06.780]  That is air.
[37:07.280 --> 37:07.880]  That is amazing.
[37:08.020 --> 37:09.400]  Mike Witt and then Kurt Young.
[37:09.500 --> 37:10.220]  That is really cool.
[37:10.300 --> 37:13.260]  I'm going to have to look this set up and find out what it's all about.
[37:13.960 --> 37:15.200]  It's not that I'm ignoring you over here.
[37:15.220 --> 37:17.380]  I'm just like rooting through trying to find unusual things.
[37:17.420 --> 37:18.740]  No, dude, I love it. Thank you.
[37:20.280 --> 37:21.000]  That's cool.
[37:21.580 --> 37:22.840]  Do you remember any of these?
[37:23.100 --> 37:24.960]  Or was it just there was so much stuff?
[37:25.260 --> 37:26.740]  Like that game winner.
[37:26.860 --> 37:27.740]  Can you go to the store?
[37:27.820 --> 37:28.600]  Is it like how it is now?
[37:28.740 --> 37:30.680]  I don't remember ever seeing that.
[37:30.680 --> 37:31.040]  I don't.
[37:31.240 --> 37:31.720]  I have no...
[37:32.400 --> 37:34.160]  Obviously, I collected baseball cards at the time.
[37:34.220 --> 37:35.220]  I have no memory of that set.
[37:35.380 --> 37:39.340]  Yeah, I don't think that that was maybe very popular.
[37:39.480 --> 37:39.780]  I don't know.
[37:39.900 --> 37:40.460]  It's interesting.
[37:40.600 --> 37:42.440]  I'm wondering if maybe there's some money in there.
[37:43.980 --> 37:44.760]  Okay, let's see.
[37:45.000 --> 37:45.640]  The Milwaukee Brewers.
[37:46.100 --> 37:50.740]  Wallace Johnson, Geoffrey Leonard, Jose Uribe, Kent Merker, Eddie Murray, Larry Sheets.
[37:50.760 --> 37:52.180]  I wonder how many of these people are dead now.
[37:52.900 --> 37:56.420]  Bill Doran, Walt Rice, David Justice, who's a great player.
[37:57.240 --> 37:58.840]  Mike Blower, Sammy Sosa.
[37:58.840 --> 38:01.880]  He had a lot of home runs and did a lot of steroids.
[38:01.960 --> 38:03.460]  This was before he got worms?
[38:04.180 --> 38:05.680]  This was before he got worms, yeah.
[38:05.680 --> 38:07.400]  He was probably, what is this, 90?
[38:07.460 --> 38:09.760]  He was probably just investigating worms at this point.
[38:10.200 --> 38:14.840]  Cecil Espy, Andres Thomas, Robin Ventura, Frank DiPino, Jose DeJesus.
[38:15.800 --> 38:17.200]  So, it's a funny thing about that.
[38:17.480 --> 38:20.260]  You talk about him getting worms, obviously him doing steroids.
[38:20.440 --> 38:20.680]  Right.
[38:21.120 --> 38:25.580]  This week's So All Right episode is on the first high five.
[38:25.580 --> 38:31.000]  And how I found out that there was a lot more to the first high five than just the Dusty Baker-Glenn Burke high five.
[38:31.240 --> 38:31.360]  Yeah.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.520]  And in it, another thing that was happening that season in 1977,
[38:38.100 --> 38:43.000]  when Dusty Baker and Glenn Burke invented the high five, which sounds like utter bullshit still to me.
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.380]  It didn't exist before 1977?
[38:44.540 --> 38:45.980]  It was invented in 1977.
[38:46.480 --> 38:48.600]  And it was entered into the Oxford Dictionary in 1980.
[38:48.900 --> 38:51.500]  Like, apparently nobody had ever thought to fucking high five before.
[38:51.760 --> 38:53.660]  It's insane. You have to listen to this week's So All Right.
[38:53.660 --> 38:55.040]  I'm really excited to hear this.
[38:55.040 --> 38:57.840]  But anyway, that year was a big year for a lot of reasons.
[38:58.180 --> 39:06.960]  It actually happened on the last day of the season because there was this thing happening where there were four players on the Dodgers that were all going to hit 30 home runs that year.
[39:07.040 --> 39:09.060]  It had never been done in history.
[39:09.460 --> 39:12.300]  Four players on the same team hit 30 home runs in the same season.
[39:12.400 --> 39:18.280]  It was Ron Say, it was Steve Garvey, it was... I don't remember the other person, and then Dusty Baker.
[39:18.860 --> 39:20.240]  Maybe Otis Nixon or someone like that.
[39:20.240 --> 39:28.260]  And the last game of the year, everybody hit the 30 home runs except for fucking Dusty Baker.
[39:28.520 --> 39:32.700]  And he had like... he hit 29 with five games to go.
[39:32.940 --> 39:34.900]  And he just had shitty game, shitty game, shitty game.
[39:34.960 --> 39:42.900]  So the last game, if he hits a home run, he gets 30 and then they break the record and they're the first team in the history of baseball to have four players hit 30 home runs, right?
[39:43.060 --> 39:47.680]  So he does it on that game and that's what caused the high five, right?
[39:49.640 --> 39:50.040]  But...
[39:50.980 --> 39:52.380]  That didn't happen again.
[39:52.760 --> 39:54.680]  This is a long way of me telling a steroids story.
[39:55.040 --> 39:58.740]  That doesn't happen again from 1977 until like 1997.
[39:59.440 --> 40:08.420]  And then it happens in 1997, and then in 98, and then in 99, and then twice in 2000, and then in 2001, and twice in 2002, and then in 2003, and then in 2004.
[40:08.760 --> 40:09.740]  Weird. What changed?
[40:10.020 --> 40:11.020]  What changed, right?
[40:11.120 --> 40:12.760]  And then...
[40:12.760 --> 40:16.420]  Then people started getting busted for steroids and then it hasn't happened since.
[40:16.420 --> 40:17.040]  Interesting.
[40:17.380 --> 40:22.480]  It happened like 15 times in like 11 years and then stopped all at once.
[40:22.700 --> 40:22.960]  Yeah.
[40:23.140 --> 40:28.660]  I'm excited to hear your episode of Stall Ride about the high five because someone put their arm up for the first time ever...
[40:28.660 --> 40:28.780]  Glenn Burke.
[40:28.800 --> 40:31.980]  ...hoping that someone else would know what to do and they would figure it out.
[40:32.200 --> 40:32.380]  Yeah.
[40:32.440 --> 40:38.620]  Yeah, it's a crazy story because that dude, Glenn Burke, turned out he was gay and he was...
[40:38.620 --> 40:43.300]  He ended up coming out and being the first Major League Baseball player to come out, but it was shortly after he retired.
[40:43.300 --> 40:51.560]  And he got run out of the league for being gay, unfortunately, but he ended up moving to San Francisco where he was credited for inventing the high five.
[40:51.720 --> 40:54.960]  And then it became like a symbol of pride and acceptance in San Francisco.
[40:55.240 --> 41:03.720]  And so the high five was actually... became like a part of a movement way before it was a thing people were doing to celebrate hitting balls or whatever.
[41:04.140 --> 41:06.120]  It became very important in San Francisco and in that culture.
[41:06.400 --> 41:06.480]  Interesting.
[41:06.480 --> 41:10.860]  And he would sit outside clubs and high five people, letting them know it was safe to go in and stuff.
[41:10.920 --> 41:11.240]  It was cool.
[41:11.500 --> 41:11.860]  Wow.
[41:12.640 --> 41:13.000]  That's...
[41:13.000 --> 41:13.400]  Who knew?
[41:13.420 --> 41:13.800]  I had no idea.
[41:13.900 --> 41:13.920]  Right.
[41:14.340 --> 41:14.520]  Yeah.
[41:14.820 --> 41:16.700]  All because I found out so much interesting stuff.
[41:16.960 --> 41:22.380]  Also, I found out a whole bunch of shit about Steve Garvey and how he's allegedly kind of a piece of shit.
[41:22.400 --> 41:23.560]  Is that his card we saw earlier?
[41:23.840 --> 41:23.860]  Yeah.
[41:23.860 --> 41:24.440]  Yeah, we've seen him in here.
[41:24.640 --> 41:25.160]  Yeah, he's nice.
[41:25.160 --> 41:26.740]  He got fucking...
[41:26.740 --> 41:29.360]  He had this, like, family values image.
[41:29.660 --> 41:34.400]  Like, they used to call him the senator because he wanted to leave baseball and become a senator and get into politics.
[41:34.840 --> 41:38.260]  And he ended up having an affair on his wife with his secretary.
[41:38.560 --> 41:38.800]  Classic.
[41:38.800 --> 41:41.500]  So his wife left him for Marvin Hamlisch, of all people.
[41:42.060 --> 41:46.800]  And then after his wife left him and he's just with the secretary, then he starts dating this CNN anchor.
[41:47.520 --> 41:49.760]  And then he starts dating this other lady.
[41:50.060 --> 41:51.540]  And then he gets the other lady pregnant.
[41:51.680 --> 41:57.080]  And as soon as he gets the other lady pregnant, he proposes to the CNN anchor.
[41:57.400 --> 41:58.340]  And then he gets her pregnant.
[41:58.680 --> 42:08.120]  And then when she gets pregnant, he breaks up with her over the phone and then marries a third... a fourth woman out of the blue who he met at a charity function three months later.
[42:08.120 --> 42:14.300]  So he had two different women pregnant at the same time with his kids while he was marrying a third woman.
[42:14.640 --> 42:17.940]  And then jilting the first woman who he'd initially had the affair with.
[42:18.040 --> 42:19.080]  Family values, am I right?
[42:19.820 --> 42:21.660]  Anyway, he's running for senator of California now.
[42:21.700 --> 42:24.000]  He's trying to fill Dianne Feinstein's seat.
[42:24.000 --> 42:24.340]  He is?
[42:24.480 --> 42:25.720]  Yeah, he's running as a Republican.
[42:27.140 --> 42:28.360]  Jodi Reed, family values, right?
[42:29.480 --> 42:32.940]  Benny DeStefano, Shane Rawley, Chuck Finley, Dave Schmidt.
[42:33.060 --> 42:35.260]  I just ruined that episode of So Alright, by the way.
[42:35.260 --> 42:38.960]  You should still listen to it because there's still a lot more information.
[42:39.220 --> 42:40.520]  Yeah, I talk about Tommy Lasorda too.
[42:41.220 --> 42:48.100]  Mike Jackson, Blaine Beatty, Keith Comstock, John Kruk, Greg Vaughn, Joel Skinner.
[42:48.920 --> 42:49.360]  Skinner!
[42:50.940 --> 42:56.300]  Those two dudes. Junior Felix, Willie Frazier, Ruben Sierra, 10th anniversary George Bell.
[42:56.820 --> 42:57.680]  Ruben Sierra was a great player.
[42:58.380 --> 43:00.720]  Let's keep cracking those. Give me some of those dollars.
[43:01.700 --> 43:04.680]  It's another MVP one. It's the only other MVP one I've been able to find so far.
[43:04.680 --> 43:06.520]  Let's see if we get some more MVPs.
[43:06.520 --> 43:09.140]  Let's see if we get more of my puzzle piece. I'm working on an arm over here.
[43:09.180 --> 43:09.980]  Did that come from the MVP?
[43:10.180 --> 43:11.720]  I think it came from the Donruss.
[43:12.340 --> 43:14.880]  Oh, I wonder if that's a Ted Williams...
[43:14.880 --> 43:17.020]  It looks like it. It's a type of...
[43:17.020 --> 43:17.680]  There you go.
[43:19.520 --> 43:23.700]  Geoff Brantley, Ben McDonald, Scott...
[43:23.700 --> 43:24.640]  Scott had a farm.
[43:24.780 --> 43:31.600]  Whatever that is. Scott Lussiter, Eric King, Geoffrey Leonard, Eric Cho, Lenny Harris, Todd Benzinger,
[43:31.600 --> 43:40.680]  Mike Sharperson, Bob Kipper, Kurt Stilwell was a good player, Lee Mazzelli, Rich Monteleone, Mike Bielecki,
[43:40.980 --> 43:43.080]  Bo Aldred, and Burt Blylevin.
[43:43.400 --> 43:44.440]  Let's open up some more.
[43:45.240 --> 43:46.540]  No big hits yet.
[43:46.780 --> 43:49.580]  I felt like we had quite a few last time I was here.
[43:49.640 --> 43:51.400]  Yeah, maybe we over-indexed last time.
[43:53.120 --> 43:57.240]  Maybe... I don't know, maybe we just need to dump them all out, you know, and then just see what you get.
[43:57.260 --> 43:58.500]  It's so much. I mean...
[43:58.500 --> 44:01.380]  All right, here we go. Got our first hit.
[44:01.800 --> 44:05.980]  Nolan Ryan, King of Kings, so we'll sleeve that and figure out how much that's worth.
[44:07.180 --> 44:08.220]  Rob Dribble...
[44:09.180 --> 44:10.300]  That's the wrong sport.
[44:11.400 --> 44:11.920]  Dribble...
[44:12.800 --> 44:20.260]  Terry Leach, Rick Rochelle, Eric Hansen, Ken Daly... Surely an amount of these people are dead.
[44:20.760 --> 44:20.880]  Yeah.
[44:21.360 --> 44:23.960]  Rick Rochelle, like Rochelle Rochelle from Seinfeld?
[44:25.040 --> 44:26.080]  Rochelle, Rochelle...
[44:26.080 --> 44:26.300]  Yeah.
[44:28.000 --> 44:29.520]  Yeah, a good number of them.
[44:29.620 --> 44:32.780]  Joe McGrane, Glen Allen Hill, Gary Gaiety...
[44:32.780 --> 44:34.740]  If not from old age, just like mundane things.
[44:35.120 --> 44:38.180]  Tim Belcher, yeah, just from like everyday dying stuff.
[44:38.820 --> 44:39.240]  Tripped.
[44:40.660 --> 44:43.020]  Fucking fell asleep in a hot tub, apparently.
[44:43.580 --> 44:47.680]  Mike Maddox, oh, here we go, another Nolan Ryan card, 5,000 Ks.
[44:47.920 --> 44:48.280]  Dang!
[44:48.800 --> 44:49.080]  Oh!
[44:49.480 --> 44:49.740]  What?
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.120]  I think that might actually be a rarer card out of this bunch.
[44:53.240 --> 44:53.460]  Yeah?
[44:53.840 --> 44:59.900]  Yeah, I've never actually pulled the 5,000 Ks card, and I think I remember reading that this one's actually worth a little bit more, so let's...
[44:59.900 --> 44:59.920]  Interesting.
[45:00.040 --> 45:00.700]  Keep an eye on that.
[45:00.820 --> 45:05.460]  I was at the Rangers game that Nolan Ryan got ejected from. Only time he was ever ejected from a game, I was there.
[45:05.500 --> 45:06.580]  When he fought Robin Ventura?
[45:06.720 --> 45:09.640]  No, that was away, I believe that was in Chicago.
[45:09.680 --> 45:09.880]  Okay.
[45:10.040 --> 45:16.700]  He beamed a player twice in one game, and after he hit the batter for the second time, the ump threw him out.
[45:16.700 --> 45:21.080]  And then the fans all took all of the garbage they had, all the food, and just like threw it on the field.
[45:21.160 --> 45:24.900]  They had to stop the game for an hour while everyone got their rage out and they cleaned up the field.
[45:24.920 --> 45:26.080]  You don't throw Nolan Ryan out of a game.
[45:26.080 --> 45:26.700]  What would you...
[45:27.220 --> 45:29.620]  How would you look at this cut and see?
[45:30.520 --> 45:32.540]  Cause I just did a real quick little search.
[45:33.080 --> 45:36.940]  Uh, it'd be... I'd look up Nolan Ryan, 659.
[45:37.440 --> 45:40.780]  Oh no, I see it, but how would you say the quality of that card is?
[45:40.840 --> 45:43.180]  Uh, it's... well, let me show it in front of you guys.
[45:43.180 --> 45:46.820]  So it's clearly... it's off-center a little bit. It's a little short on the left side.
[45:47.120 --> 45:51.960]  But as long as it's not more than 40% off, it can still grade out as a 10.
[45:52.160 --> 45:53.740]  It's probably right there on the border.
[45:54.400 --> 45:58.860]  Um, it's clean. Very clean edges, especially for the age.
[45:59.540 --> 46:03.620]  Uh, I'm gonna guess this card... it's a little too far off on the back.
[46:03.940 --> 46:05.880]  It's pretty far off on the back.
[46:05.920 --> 46:07.900]  I'm gonna guess this card could get you a 9, probably.
[46:08.380 --> 46:13.720]  So on here, which it's hard, because it's just like... I know you're way better at looking at the values, but...
[46:13.720 --> 46:17.820]  It looks like certain ones are being sold for six grand.
[46:19.220 --> 46:22.560]  But I think you know what you're looking at better. I'm just gonna do a quick little search.
[46:22.780 --> 46:24.180]  Uh, yeah, I'll look into that.
[46:24.240 --> 46:28.200]  But then there's another one that says rare error card. It's 485.
[46:28.560 --> 46:31.140]  Those are probably... rare error cards are probably bullshit.
[46:31.480 --> 46:32.940]  Yeah, does this mean it's a bad cut?
[46:32.940 --> 46:38.440]  Or, like, this was the age of error cards, and so there were legitimate error cards.
[46:38.720 --> 46:42.160]  There were a ton of, like, misprints and dumb little errors that just weren't interesting.
[46:42.320 --> 46:46.380]  But everybody is trying to play it up, because nobody really gives a shit about error cards anymore.
[46:46.380 --> 46:47.480]  Only from that era.
[46:47.740 --> 46:48.300]  Oh, okay.
[46:48.760 --> 46:51.720]  Uh, I have a bunch of error... I get error cards all the time now.
[46:51.980 --> 46:53.040]  And it's just more trash?
[46:53.220 --> 46:57.580]  For, like, 2023, uh, like, Prism NBA, and it's like...
[46:57.580 --> 46:58.840]  Look at before and after.
[47:02.590 --> 47:04.230]  That's... that's fuckin' life for ya.
[47:05.030 --> 47:07.190]  You should see him now. I saw him in a commercial the other day.
[47:07.250 --> 47:07.490]  Oof.
[47:07.690 --> 47:08.290]  He's, uh...
[47:08.290 --> 47:10.030]  Is he the one that has, like, meat?
[47:11.250 --> 47:14.070]  Doesn't someone... one of them sell, like, sausages or something?
[47:14.150 --> 47:15.470]  Oh, that's Elgin Baylor, right?
[47:15.610 --> 47:17.190]  Oh, yeah, that is not, uh...
[47:17.190 --> 47:17.670]  He's a football player.
[47:17.810 --> 47:18.170]  Oh, okay.
[47:18.410 --> 47:22.030]  Uh, George Bell. His, uh... name is a thing.
[47:24.110 --> 47:26.190]  John, uh... Castle of Cagliostri.
[47:26.510 --> 47:26.950]  Earl Campbell.
[47:27.170 --> 47:28.790]  Earl Campbell. Earl Campbell, that's it, sorry.
[47:28.790 --> 47:29.730]  Dave Martinez.
[47:30.790 --> 47:32.210]  Uh, Kirby Puckett.
[47:32.350 --> 47:33.030]  Joe Oliver.
[47:33.670 --> 47:34.750]  Tom Ragnosi.
[47:34.930 --> 47:36.770]  I know fuckin' Mike's probably pulling his hair out back there.
[47:37.250 --> 47:38.170]  Herm Winningham.
[47:38.570 --> 47:39.710]  Uh, Mike Kingery.
[47:39.850 --> 47:41.430]  Steve Sachs? Again, a lot of Steve Sachs today.
[47:41.570 --> 47:41.670]  Yeah.
[47:42.330 --> 47:44.150]  Uh, Doug Jones.
[47:44.490 --> 47:45.690]  Goose Gossage. That's great.
[47:45.730 --> 47:47.110]  Goose! I knew that animal name.
[47:47.990 --> 47:49.030]  Darnell Coles.
[47:49.150 --> 47:49.850]  Donnell Nixon.
[47:50.150 --> 47:51.030]  Andy Bennis rookie.
[47:51.150 --> 47:51.630]  Not worth anything.
[47:51.750 --> 47:52.570]  Eric Anthony rookie.
[47:52.890 --> 47:53.550]  Johnny Ray.
[47:54.090 --> 47:55.790]  Dude, I'm emboldened by this...
[47:56.630 --> 47:57.610]  Nolan Ryan card.
[47:58.210 --> 48:02.290]  Maybe we just have, like, one shitty week, and then we have one good week of values.
[48:02.850 --> 48:07.910]  Well, you know what? We are gonna have... Gus, I do have one special thing I want to open up at the very end of the day for us.
[48:08.490 --> 48:09.870]  Let's see if I can find it, tease it.
[48:10.510 --> 48:12.670]  These just came out. They were very hard for me to get.
[48:13.330 --> 48:14.690]  I had to put a lot of work into them.
[48:15.630 --> 48:17.010]  So this will be what we open last.
[48:17.610 --> 48:18.850]  I got a couple packs of these.
[48:19.390 --> 48:22.610]  Uh, Topps did a crossover with the, uh...
[48:23.010 --> 48:27.070]  Uh, Joy of Painting Bob Ross people, and so they have Joy of Baseball.
[48:27.470 --> 48:27.790]  Nice.
[48:27.990 --> 48:29.870]  This is one exclusive easel parallel.
[48:30.250 --> 48:31.350]  Have you seen any of these?
[48:31.510 --> 48:31.570]  No.
[48:31.990 --> 48:35.970]  So you don't even know what they look like, if they're paintings of people, or if it's, like, people with the painting on the background?
[48:35.990 --> 48:38.790]  I did see... I think they're paintings.
[48:39.290 --> 48:40.330]  But I don't remember.
[48:40.590 --> 48:42.070]  They were really fucking hard to get.
[48:42.230 --> 48:42.370]  Yeah.
[48:42.430 --> 48:45.130]  I had to get in line to do it online, and then by the time I...
[48:45.130 --> 48:46.270]  I got the same puzzle pieces.
[48:47.370 --> 48:47.690]  Uh...
[48:47.690 --> 48:48.770]  Well, you can trade with your friends.
[48:49.110 --> 48:49.270]  Okay.
[48:49.930 --> 48:51.250]  Jim Deshaies, Dave Stewart.
[48:51.370 --> 48:52.990]  It's a fucking great picture. I wish that was worth something.
[48:53.090 --> 48:53.910]  Mike Fitzgerald.
[48:54.530 --> 48:55.170]  Mark Guthrie.
[48:55.410 --> 48:56.270]  Todd Stottlemyre.
[48:56.270 --> 48:57.190]  Dennis Cook.
[48:57.290 --> 48:58.630]  David Wells.
[48:58.970 --> 49:00.010]  Joey Cora.
[49:00.350 --> 49:01.790]  Chet Lemon is a food.
[49:02.370 --> 49:03.110]  Bobby Witt.
[49:03.350 --> 49:05.750]  His son, Bobby Witt Jr., plays right now.
[49:05.850 --> 49:07.110]  We could have a father-son thing.
[49:07.550 --> 49:08.310]  Mike Witt.
[49:08.470 --> 49:09.110]  Carlos Quintana.
[49:10.690 --> 49:11.490]  Todd Frohwerth.
[49:11.590 --> 49:12.270]  Wally Backman.
[49:13.450 --> 49:14.250]  Rick Honeycutt.
[49:14.330 --> 49:15.210]  We used to call him Honeycutt.
[49:15.790 --> 49:16.190]  Really?
[49:16.450 --> 49:18.090]  Billy Hatcher and Rick Rochelle.
[49:18.190 --> 49:19.090]  When we were kids, yeah.
[49:19.210 --> 49:19.830]  Rochelle, Rochelle.
[49:20.210 --> 49:21.010]  You got any more of those Donners?
[49:21.430 --> 49:22.030]  Yeah, I sure do.
[49:22.450 --> 49:22.710]  I've got...
[49:22.710 --> 49:23.830]  I'd rather open those than the flare, I think.
[49:23.870 --> 49:25.650]  I've got so many fucking Donners, dude.
[49:25.650 --> 49:27.130]  We'll open, like, five or six more packs,
[49:27.190 --> 49:28.470]  then we'll open up this Joy of Baseball.
[49:28.650 --> 49:29.770]  This George Bell was...
[49:29.770 --> 49:31.010]  Oh, wait, we already have...
[49:31.010 --> 49:32.630]  There's a lot in here that we already have,
[49:32.690 --> 49:33.710]  but I'm just adding to it.
[49:33.730 --> 49:34.070]  Six more.
[49:34.210 --> 49:34.410]  Perfect.
[49:35.550 --> 49:36.710]  We'll finish out with these,
[49:36.770 --> 49:37.950]  and then we'll do some Joy of Painting.
[49:38.070 --> 49:38.750]  Here, open this one, too,
[49:38.770 --> 49:40.090]  because I dropped it, and it, like...
[49:40.090 --> 49:41.410]  Dang, this went by really fast.
[49:42.150 --> 49:43.870]  Yeah, it really does sometimes, doesn't it?
[49:43.870 --> 49:44.310]  Oh, wow.
[49:45.290 --> 49:46.810]  Oh, you know, we should mention now
[49:46.810 --> 49:47.450]  that the show's almost over.
[49:47.790 --> 49:50.210]  We're doing a segment for Extra Life.
[49:50.310 --> 49:50.610]  Yes.
[49:51.450 --> 49:54.870]  And everybody, Gus, wants me to shred baseball cards,
[49:55.310 --> 49:56.770]  but I'm not going to fucking do it.
[49:56.990 --> 49:57.070]  Okay.
[49:57.170 --> 49:57.770]  Here's what I will do.
[49:57.830 --> 49:58.530]  They gave me a budget.
[49:58.990 --> 49:59.990]  We'll see what you think about this, Gracie.
[50:00.270 --> 50:02.550]  They gave me a budget of $500 to buy stuff.
[50:02.670 --> 50:05.410]  And why do you want to shred the baseball cards and sports cards?
[50:05.410 --> 50:06.290]  Because I respect them,
[50:06.310 --> 50:09.130]  and I think that they have value to me and to other people,
[50:09.170 --> 50:10.250]  and I don't want to destroy something
[50:10.250 --> 50:11.250]  that has intrinsic value.
[50:11.430 --> 50:11.650]  To you.
[50:11.670 --> 50:13.830]  But I don't recognize that Pokemon
[50:14.970 --> 50:16.390]  or Magic the Gathering have any value.
[50:16.590 --> 50:17.370]  So I was thinking,
[50:17.490 --> 50:19.710]  what if we buy, like, $500 worth of Pokemon cards,
[50:19.890 --> 50:21.930]  and you guys have to pay me to stop shredding them?
[50:22.390 --> 50:24.430]  Like, I just start shredding for 90 minutes,
[50:24.430 --> 50:26.390]  and you have to pay me not to shred certain cards.
[50:26.870 --> 50:28.010]  Anyway, we're workshopping.
[50:28.030 --> 50:28.490]  We'll figure it out, yeah.
[50:29.510 --> 50:32.430]  Dodgers, Mike Jackson, Scott Gerlitz,
[50:32.590 --> 50:34.350]  Frank Williams, Geoff Hamilton,
[50:34.650 --> 50:36.690]  Brian Holton, Glenn Davis, Bob Welch.
[50:37.090 --> 50:38.570]  It's a shame that these cards aren't worth anything
[50:38.570 --> 50:39.870]  because they hold up a lot better.
[50:39.990 --> 50:42.410]  Sean Hillegus, Don Slot.
[50:42.950 --> 50:43.930]  That guy's name sounds like...
[50:43.930 --> 50:44.790]  Dude, that's a good one.
[50:44.930 --> 50:45.610]  He's the...
[50:45.610 --> 50:47.410]  I wonder if his nickname was the Don Slot.
[50:47.550 --> 50:48.670]  We should...
[50:48.670 --> 50:49.690]  Do you...
[50:49.690 --> 50:50.790]  Ah, shit.
[50:51.070 --> 50:51.290]  What?
[50:51.630 --> 50:54.350]  Nolan Ryan, but it's dinged pretty hard.
[50:54.350 --> 50:55.130]  You can't tell.
[50:55.370 --> 50:56.210]  Why'd you do that, Gus?
[50:56.530 --> 50:56.750]  I don't know.
[50:56.750 --> 50:57.290]  It fell.
[50:58.230 --> 50:59.670]  Probably when we dumped it on the table.
[51:00.030 --> 51:02.250]  It's dinged too hard to be worth anything, but...
[51:02.250 --> 51:03.530]  Odabee McDowell,
[51:05.050 --> 51:05.770]  Ken Hill,
[51:06.390 --> 51:07.630]  Dude, Rick Yet.
[51:08.190 --> 51:09.290]  Are you rich yet?
[51:09.590 --> 51:11.450]  Dude, there's all kinds of funny...
[51:11.450 --> 51:12.530]  Name is a question.
[51:12.970 --> 51:13.690]  Name is a question.
[51:14.510 --> 51:16.350]  Gus, do you like magic or Pokemon?
[51:17.030 --> 51:18.310]  I used to be a magic player, pretty.
[51:18.410 --> 51:20.470]  So you would know what's worth anything.
[51:20.550 --> 51:21.490]  From like 20 years ago.
[51:21.490 --> 51:21.650]  Okay.
[51:21.750 --> 51:22.550]  25 years ago.
[51:22.550 --> 51:25.910]  Oh, it looks like the audience said, yeah, shred all the Pokemon cards.
[51:25.930 --> 51:26.830]  Yeah, they're really into it.
[51:26.870 --> 51:27.550]  I love it.
[51:27.830 --> 51:28.710]  Yeah, no, I'll do it.
[51:28.810 --> 51:29.910]  We could...
[51:29.910 --> 51:31.430]  There's all different ways we could do it.
[51:31.650 --> 51:32.670]  We could do a shredder.
[51:32.750 --> 51:33.710]  We could do a food processor.
[51:34.150 --> 51:34.890]  We could do...
[51:34.890 --> 51:36.930]  And if you want me to save some, I have a way to...
[51:36.930 --> 51:38.950]  I can show you how to preserve cards right on set.
[51:39.030 --> 51:39.310]  I think...
[51:39.310 --> 51:40.210]  I got a cool way to do it.
[51:40.270 --> 51:46.930]  What might be funnier or what might play more visually is if you get like a paper cutter and like cut it right down the middle.
[51:46.950 --> 51:49.190]  And then you open it and show like this is what we just destroyed.
[51:49.410 --> 51:49.830]  Yeah, yeah, we can do that.
[51:49.830 --> 51:51.950]  We have the little thing that we were playing with this weekend.
[51:51.950 --> 51:53.050]  But I like the bigger...
[51:53.990 --> 51:55.730]  Like the thing like the teachers used to do.
[51:56.350 --> 51:57.450]  The thing you'd always stare at.
[51:57.490 --> 51:58.610]  The one that takes off a fingernail.
[51:58.930 --> 51:58.950]  Yeah.
[51:59.330 --> 52:05.990]  Edward Nunez, Robbie Thompson, Ken Patterson, Checklist, Andy Van Slyke, Gerald Clark, Bobby Ojeda, John Smoltz.
[52:06.590 --> 52:07.930]  He's a baseball announcer now.
[52:08.050 --> 52:08.990]  Very good announcer.
[52:09.170 --> 52:09.930]  He's a good color man.
[52:10.030 --> 52:10.550]  He's a good pitcher too.
[52:10.590 --> 52:11.870]  He's doing the World Series, I think, actually.
[52:11.970 --> 52:15.290]  Otto B. McDowell, Bernie Williams, Lance Parrish.
[52:15.310 --> 52:16.390]  Yeah, he was also a great pitcher.
[52:16.390 --> 52:17.870]  Yeah, we just had an Otto B. McDowell right before this.
[52:17.870 --> 52:21.870]  Pat Tabler, Rick Dempsey, Geoff Robinson, John Smiley.
[52:22.070 --> 52:23.510]  Not looking so fucking smiley.
[52:23.890 --> 52:25.070]  No, that's pretty smiley.
[52:25.470 --> 52:27.870]  Maybe he shouldn't be so smiley.
[52:28.550 --> 52:29.970]  Look at that shark teeth there.
[52:30.030 --> 52:31.290]  Should I say that he's not well?
[52:31.670 --> 52:32.910]  You think he goes into that?
[52:33.530 --> 52:34.850]  I think he's something.
[52:36.130 --> 52:37.050]  Okay, yeah, we got a few.
[52:37.170 --> 52:38.150]  We got enough time to get through these.
[52:38.350 --> 52:40.270]  Maybe we'll get lucky and we'll get another...
[52:40.270 --> 52:42.690]  Griffey Jr. or...
[52:42.690 --> 52:43.690]  Talerkin Jr.
[52:44.690 --> 52:45.650]  One of the juniors.
[52:46.110 --> 52:47.570]  Yeah, somebody that's gotta be...
[52:47.570 --> 52:48.210]  We need a junior.
[52:48.650 --> 52:50.770]  Rod Nichols, J. Bell, Larry Sheets.
[52:52.230 --> 52:52.830]  That's a thing.
[52:53.350 --> 52:55.690]  Yeah, there's all kinds of funny jokes you can make with that.
[52:56.150 --> 52:59.690]  Sean Hillegas, Paul Sorrento, Von Hayes, I know.
[53:00.630 --> 53:03.530]  Ellis Burks, Claudel Washington.
[53:03.730 --> 53:04.590]  Oh, there you go.
[53:04.970 --> 53:06.910]  This card, Bo Jackson, we'll sleeve that.
[53:06.950 --> 53:07.250]  Okay.
[53:07.590 --> 53:08.410]  That's probably worth something.
[53:08.530 --> 53:09.230]  I think we pulled it before.
[53:09.510 --> 53:09.910]  I think so.
[53:09.970 --> 53:13.850]  Greg Harris, Greg Catteret, Dave Winfield.
[53:14.070 --> 53:14.990]  The two Gregs.
[53:14.990 --> 53:18.650]  Ken Obergefell, Terry Bross, and Fernando Valenzuela again.
[53:19.230 --> 53:20.030]  Seen a lot of him today.
[53:20.110 --> 53:20.990]  He's wearing his glasses there.
[53:21.330 --> 53:26.870]  Fernando Valenzuela, I think, might be the best pitcher who didn't look like a pitcher to me.
[53:27.290 --> 53:29.790]  The best baseball player who doesn't look like a baseball player.
[53:29.790 --> 53:31.830]  He was much thinner in the other card we pulled earlier.
[53:31.970 --> 53:33.190]  This is, you can tell he's a...
[53:33.190 --> 53:35.110]  Most of my childhood was this page.
[53:35.150 --> 53:35.350]  Yeah.
[53:35.710 --> 53:37.070]  Or, sorry, Fernando Valenzuela.
[53:37.230 --> 53:37.850]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[53:39.190 --> 53:39.950]  His name's...
[53:39.950 --> 53:42.110]  I feel like they're having trouble fitting his name on that card.
[53:42.250 --> 53:43.330]  Like they're running out of space there.
[53:43.950 --> 53:45.470]  Another fucking Ken Obergefell.
[53:45.590 --> 53:46.310]  Man, we could...
[53:46.310 --> 53:48.790]  If we can find the Ken Obergefell market, we're gonna...
[53:48.790 --> 53:49.590]  We're gonna destroy it.
[53:49.670 --> 53:49.990]  We're gonna get rich.
[53:50.390 --> 53:51.230]  Eric Plunk.
[53:51.570 --> 53:52.550]  That's a...
[53:53.790 --> 53:56.430]  Gary Pettis, Mark Davis, Super Brown.
[53:56.710 --> 53:58.590]  Another Bo Jackson MVP card.
[53:58.690 --> 53:59.410]  We just got one of those.
[53:59.570 --> 54:06.630]  Tony Armas, Kelly Gruber, Vaughn Hayes, Rick Aguilar, Ron Kittle, Mark Thurman,
[54:06.630 --> 54:13.050]  Jay Bell, Felix Fuhrman, Mauro Gozo, Steve Bedrosian.
[54:13.530 --> 54:14.390]  All right, we...
[54:14.390 --> 54:15.070]  Yeah, we're doing well.
[54:15.290 --> 54:16.510]  Three more packs here.
[54:17.410 --> 54:18.210]  Maybe we'll...
[54:18.210 --> 54:20.150]  You can always stop and switch over at any time to the other one.
[54:20.770 --> 54:23.150]  What's another way that takes down value of cards?
[54:23.870 --> 54:24.270]  Edging...
[54:24.270 --> 54:26.010]  Like the edges, like smashing the edges.
[54:26.330 --> 54:27.010]  Maybe if you had like a...
[54:27.010 --> 54:27.110]  Scuffs.
[54:27.110 --> 54:29.430]  Like a sander, and you like sand down one of the edges.
[54:29.510 --> 54:30.290]  Any imperfection...
[54:30.730 --> 54:32.550]  You do have your big...
[54:32.550 --> 54:34.490]  thing that you did the baseball bats with.
[54:34.590 --> 54:35.150]  Yeah, that's true.
[54:35.590 --> 54:36.130]  Gary Carter.
[54:36.130 --> 54:37.490]  Are we in the hands here?
[54:37.530 --> 54:38.470]  I could burn...
[54:38.470 --> 54:39.710]  I could get the woodburner and burn my hand.
[54:39.710 --> 54:40.390]  Right through the middle.
[54:40.630 --> 54:43.830]  Joey Bell, Ed Witson, Kenny Rogers, Eric Davis.
[54:43.970 --> 54:44.410]  Kenny Rogers?
[54:44.510 --> 54:44.830]  Williamson.
[54:44.910 --> 54:45.770]  He's also a great singer.
[54:47.330 --> 54:48.310]  Yeah, I guess that's true.
[54:48.490 --> 54:48.670]  Yeah?
[54:49.890 --> 54:55.410]  Charlton Fisk, Juan Berenger, Harold Baines, Alfredo Griffin, Mickey Hatcher, Don August.
[54:56.310 --> 54:58.630]  I wonder if we could fill out a whole calendar of...
[54:58.630 --> 54:59.050]  What was it?
[54:59.130 --> 54:59.510]  Man-Bem...
[54:59.510 --> 55:00.570]  Man-Bem-Manuary.
[55:01.970 --> 55:03.290]  Randy Reddy, Will Clark.
[55:04.430 --> 55:04.810]  That's...
[55:04.810 --> 55:05.670]  Brian Dubois.
[55:05.670 --> 55:06.650]  Willie Frazier.
[55:07.470 --> 55:08.330]  Last two packs.
[55:08.710 --> 55:10.770]  Then we're going to open up the joy of whatever.
[55:11.130 --> 55:13.050]  So we need to get Pokemon, Magic.
[55:13.290 --> 55:14.730]  What other cards do you not give a shit about?
[55:15.050 --> 55:15.590]  Just those two.
[55:15.870 --> 55:16.150]  Okay.
[55:16.830 --> 55:17.350]  Love it.
[55:17.830 --> 55:19.630]  I think, honestly, we could just get Pokemon.
[55:20.190 --> 55:20.470]  Yeah.
[55:20.590 --> 55:21.530]  Just focus on Pokemon.
[55:21.950 --> 55:24.110]  But, you know, we'll workshop it with Eric, see what he thinks.
[55:24.610 --> 55:28.330]  And then we can still drain the pack sack by opening it and doing stuff with that.
[55:28.330 --> 55:29.210]  Yeah, you just gotta lance it.
[55:31.210 --> 55:32.010]  Ugh, sick.
[55:32.110 --> 55:32.370]  Gross.
[55:34.430 --> 55:36.590]  But then, you know, the things that we're not going to...
[55:36.590 --> 55:37.130]  Glenn Davis.
[55:37.710 --> 55:38.590]  John Smiley.
[55:38.670 --> 55:39.290]  Not so Smiley there.
[55:39.370 --> 55:40.150]  John Smoltz.
[55:40.450 --> 55:41.330]  He's pretty Smiley.
[55:41.370 --> 55:41.870]  He's pretty Smiley.
[55:41.890 --> 55:43.370]  He's fucking baked is what he looks.
[55:44.030 --> 55:44.910]  Mark Garner.
[55:46.110 --> 55:46.990]  Jerry Roos.
[55:47.050 --> 55:48.610]  I don't know what's going on in that photo.
[55:48.830 --> 55:49.810]  I think that...
[55:49.810 --> 55:50.290]  What?
[55:50.290 --> 55:52.370]  I think that that photo was...
[55:53.090 --> 55:53.450]  Edited?
[55:53.610 --> 55:54.130]  Like photoshopped?
[55:54.490 --> 55:54.750]  Underexposed.
[55:55.090 --> 55:55.510]  Oh.
[55:55.650 --> 55:58.370]  And they had to dodge in the darkroom to...
[55:59.210 --> 55:59.530]  Yeah.
[55:59.890 --> 56:00.070]  Yeah.
[56:00.070 --> 56:01.030]  That's the only solution.
[56:01.030 --> 56:02.790]  That's the only reason why that photo looked that weird.
[56:03.270 --> 56:04.170]  Yeah, this is before photoshop.
[56:04.890 --> 56:05.190]  Yeah.
[56:05.350 --> 56:06.270]  Kurt Manwaring.
[56:06.430 --> 56:06.990]  Juan Berringer.
[56:07.090 --> 56:08.330]  That's why none of these guys are wearing...
[56:08.330 --> 56:08.550]  Manuary.
[56:08.630 --> 56:09.170]  Is that Manuary?
[56:09.790 --> 56:10.870]  Oh, that was Manuary again, wasn't it?
[56:11.090 --> 56:13.170]  That's why none of these guys are wearing their...
[56:13.170 --> 56:14.370]  It's not really Manuary.
[56:15.050 --> 56:15.370]  Manuary.
[56:15.790 --> 56:17.190]  But this is who we thought was Manuary.
[56:17.430 --> 56:18.450]  Roberto Kelly.
[56:18.730 --> 56:20.810]  The chats say we need to get Yu-Gi-Oh stuff too.
[56:20.830 --> 56:21.410]  Paul Sorrento.
[56:21.610 --> 56:22.750]  I don't give a shit about Yu-Gi-Oh.
[56:23.090 --> 56:24.110]  Terry Mulholland.
[56:24.250 --> 56:24.610]  Joey Reid.
[56:24.710 --> 56:26.170]  I'll fuck all that up.
[56:26.450 --> 56:27.550]  Oh, Burt Giamatti again.
[56:27.670 --> 56:28.830]  The little Paul Giamatti's dad.
[56:29.010 --> 56:29.230]  Oh, yeah.
[56:29.630 --> 56:30.130]  Paul's Papa.
[56:30.410 --> 56:30.770]  The Commish.
[56:31.050 --> 56:31.670]  The Commish.
[56:32.390 --> 56:34.610]  But he's the original Michael Chiklis.
[56:35.730 --> 56:36.450]  Mike Bromley.
[56:36.550 --> 56:37.510]  Kurt Stilwell.
[56:37.690 --> 56:38.430]  Lee Mazzilli.
[56:38.710 --> 56:39.230]  Rich Monteleone.
[56:40.090 --> 56:40.610]  Tommy Heard.
[56:40.650 --> 56:42.470]  You ever think about how your references just get older?
[56:42.770 --> 56:43.290]  Oh, yeah.
[56:43.510 --> 56:46.950]  Your references stay the same age as you, but you get further and further away from relevance.
[56:47.030 --> 56:48.430]  And less and less people understand it.
[56:48.450 --> 56:51.550]  Like, nobody knows that Michael Chiklis was the Commish, but you or I.
[56:51.590 --> 56:52.450]  Yeah, people older than us.
[56:52.450 --> 56:53.330]  Mike back there, yeah.
[56:53.970 --> 56:54.810]  I never watched the Commish.
[56:55.050 --> 56:55.790]  Mark Langston.
[56:55.890 --> 56:56.270]  Wally Joyner.
[56:56.310 --> 56:57.390]  It's kind of like when I was a kid.
[56:57.770 --> 56:58.410]  Pat Border.
[56:58.410 --> 56:59.290]  Scott Scudder.
[56:59.670 --> 57:00.350]  Jesse Barfield.
[57:00.370 --> 57:01.110]  Let me get through these real fast.
[57:01.930 --> 57:02.650]  Roger McDowell.
[57:02.750 --> 57:03.510]  Greg Myers.
[57:04.170 --> 57:04.830]  John Boever.
[57:04.950 --> 57:05.510]  Joe Carter.
[57:05.810 --> 57:06.390]  Scott Bradley.
[57:06.910 --> 57:07.410]  Mike Fetters.
[57:07.590 --> 57:08.290]  Ryan Sandberg.
[57:08.390 --> 57:08.910]  I love Ryan Sandberg.
[57:08.970 --> 57:09.410]  Yeah, Ryan Sandberg.
[57:09.490 --> 57:12.470]  It's kind of like when I was a kid, and I would watch Mystery Science Theater, and I
[57:12.470 --> 57:17.250]  realized when Mike started, I loved Joel, but then when Joel got replaced by Mike, and
[57:17.250 --> 57:21.390]  then I understood all of Mike's jokes, and I realized, oh, I was too young for Joel's
[57:21.390 --> 57:21.490]  humor.
[57:21.710 --> 57:24.030]  I still thought he was funny, but I didn't get any of his references.
[57:24.990 --> 57:25.110]  Careful, careful.
[57:25.110 --> 57:26.970]  What was your favorite Mystery Science Theater?
[57:28.430 --> 57:29.030]  Say if.
[57:30.010 --> 57:30.790]  Cut towards me, right?
[57:31.770 --> 57:32.810]  Yeah, cut towards your hand.
[57:33.270 --> 57:34.290]  I don't know if I had a favorite.
[57:34.370 --> 57:36.330]  I watch it every now and then, but it wasn't something that I watched.
[57:36.390 --> 57:37.550]  You didn't watch a lot growing up?
[57:37.790 --> 57:39.530]  Oh, it was like, always on.
[57:39.770 --> 57:39.890]  Yeah.
[57:40.230 --> 57:43.270]  I feel like I didn't, like, I don't know if I ever really got it on TV.
[57:43.350 --> 57:44.150]  I don't know what channel it was on.
[57:44.150 --> 57:44.610]  Comedy Central.
[57:45.130 --> 57:47.350]  Yeah, but when I was a kid, like...
[57:47.350 --> 57:47.590]  Yeah.
[57:48.190 --> 57:50.870]  Like, I think Comedy Central didn't start until I was 20.
[57:51.290 --> 57:52.270]  Oh, really?
[57:52.410 --> 57:52.630]  Yeah.
[57:52.930 --> 57:55.350]  So here we got a rookie, Taj Bradley.
[57:55.350 --> 57:56.990]  Oh, are these individually wrapped?
[57:57.210 --> 57:57.850]  This one is.
[57:57.930 --> 57:59.230]  This is like a special package.
[57:59.430 --> 58:00.450]  Wow, that's so cool.
[58:01.770 --> 58:02.930]  I'll leave it wrapped.
[58:03.030 --> 58:04.050]  That's really nice.
[58:04.290 --> 58:04.710]  That's neat.
[58:04.830 --> 58:05.650]  And then let's open up the pack.
[58:05.670 --> 58:06.510]  That's so pretty.
[58:09.270 --> 58:10.670]  It's rookie Arcee.
[58:11.330 --> 58:16.310]  Taj shows off his artistry by painting both sides of the plate on the mound with control and velocity.
[58:17.110 --> 58:19.410]  Much like the swirling storm behind him.
[58:19.530 --> 58:21.090]  Oh, these are pretty fucking cool.
[58:21.210 --> 58:21.830]  I gotta admit.
[58:22.050 --> 58:22.510]  Manny Machado.
[58:23.250 --> 58:24.610]  Why is he playing baseball in a swamp?
[58:25.910 --> 58:26.910]  That's a great question, actually.
[58:26.910 --> 58:27.350]  Gotta find hope.
[58:27.950 --> 58:30.370]  Uh, Bo Jackson. Looks like he's chopping trees.
[58:30.450 --> 58:31.010]  Bo Jackson?
[58:31.450 --> 58:33.430]  Dang, we got some of his MVP earlier.
[58:33.470 --> 58:33.810]  Luke Canbet.
[58:34.510 --> 58:35.930]  Oh, we got his thing earlier, too.
[58:36.050 --> 58:37.030]  Luis Castillo.
[58:37.450 --> 58:38.630]  Here's another all-time great.
[58:39.390 --> 58:41.170]  Mark McGuire, Mr. Steroid.
[58:41.650 --> 58:44.270]  I like that they kind of have an Alan and Ginter vibe to them.
[58:44.330 --> 58:45.330]  Yeah, they do.
[58:45.650 --> 58:46.890]  Fernando Tatis Jr.
[58:47.470 --> 58:48.650]  Uh, running from the wave.
[58:51.210 --> 58:52.390]  Miguel Vargas, rookie.
[58:52.550 --> 58:54.150]  These are so fucking cool.
[58:54.150 --> 58:55.770]  And I have two more passes.
[58:56.150 --> 58:58.990]  That one is not signed Bob Ross like the other ones were.
[58:59.390 --> 59:00.530]  Oh, that's a good point.
[59:01.230 --> 59:02.550]  I wonder if this is the rookie.
[59:02.950 --> 59:03.830]  It's on the back, though.
[59:04.310 --> 59:05.950]  But is it a difference when it's signed?
[59:06.030 --> 59:09.490]  I wonder if that's because it replaces the rookie.
[59:09.650 --> 59:10.770]  Here we have Freddie Friedman.
[59:12.490 --> 59:13.210]  Jason Veratek.
[59:13.990 --> 59:16.050]  Now here is one that's signed.
[59:16.750 --> 59:17.470]  Estoy Ruiz.
[59:17.530 --> 59:18.750]  I wonder if we have an error card there.
[59:19.730 --> 59:20.450]  Xander Bogarts.
[59:20.650 --> 59:21.150]  And then...
[59:22.430 --> 59:23.790]  Actually a pretty big hit, I think.
[59:24.210 --> 59:26.790]  Ken Griffey Jr. numbered...
[59:26.790 --> 59:27.990]  I don't know if you can tell up there.
[59:28.290 --> 59:30.490]  Oh, yeah. I can't read what number it is.
[59:30.690 --> 59:31.350]  Four of...
[59:31.350 --> 59:32.350]  Four to fifty?
[59:32.810 --> 59:33.710]  Four out of fifty.
[59:34.130 --> 59:35.450]  Number four out of fifty.
[59:36.270 --> 59:38.510]  That's a big hit for a baseball card.
[59:38.550 --> 59:41.550]  What number was Ken Griffey Jr. a player?
[59:42.370 --> 59:43.970]  Ken Griffey Jr., uh...
[59:43.970 --> 59:44.770]  I don't know what number he was.
[59:44.810 --> 59:50.030]  I know there was a thing you told me once about whatever number the card is if it matches up with their jersey number.
[59:50.270 --> 59:50.330]  Oh, right.
[59:50.330 --> 59:51.370]  It's like a bigger deal.
[59:51.510 --> 59:52.330]  Like if he was number four.
[59:52.330 --> 59:53.410]  This one was slightly more...
[59:53.410 --> 59:54.110]  I don't know. He still played.
[59:55.010 --> 59:55.830]  Did he have worms?
[59:56.830 --> 59:58.350]  No, no, no.
[59:58.430 --> 59:59.330]  As a matter of fact, he was...
[59:59.950 --> 01:00:04.630]  No, he was just a purely talented dude who had a great dad who taught him baseball the right way.
[01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:07.750]  The only thing that really fucked with Ken Griffey Jr. was injuries.
[01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:09.610]  His career kind of got cut short.
[01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:10.950]  Did he play with the Mariners his entire career?
[01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:12.690]  No, he ended up playing with...
[01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:13.730]  Oh, the Reds?
[01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:14.250]  The Reds.
[01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:14.510]  Yeah.
[01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.990]  Eventually.
[01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:17.730]  All right. Well, there you go.
[01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.990]  That's another successful episode of The Break Show.
[01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:23.790]  We ended it on a high note with a number to 50 Ken Griffey Jr. card.
[01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:24.730]  I'm pretty excited about that.
[01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:25.590]  We'll look into that.
[01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:26.930]  See what it's worth.
[01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.990]  And, uh...
[01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:30.470]  Gus, thanks for coming and spending some time with us.
[01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.850]  Thank you.
[01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:32.070]  I love doing this.
[01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:33.250]  I love going through your cards.
[01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:35.130]  You've only got about 48,000 to go.
[01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:37.550]  We can only do this maybe another 70 times.
[01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:39.390]  Based on how much we have left in there.
[01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:41.530]  I can't wait to get through all of it.
[01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:42.390]  All right. We'll see you next week.
[01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:44.110]  This was so fun. It went by so fast.
[01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:44.910]  Bye.
[01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.550]  Bye.
