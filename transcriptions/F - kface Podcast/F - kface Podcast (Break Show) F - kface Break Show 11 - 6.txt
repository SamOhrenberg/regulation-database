[00:07.930 --> 00:11.530]  Hello and welcome to another Face Break show.
[00:11.690 --> 00:13.170]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me...
[00:13.170 --> 00:15.990]  Oh, I just smashed, slammed... I'm so sorry, Mike.
[00:16.270 --> 00:17.830]  I just slammed the mic.
[00:18.230 --> 00:19.730]  Oh, I'm so sorry. That was quite loud.
[00:19.770 --> 00:22.510]  You also slammed your vocal cords by the sound of it.
[00:22.550 --> 00:23.390]  Yeah, fuck it. They're fine.
[00:23.850 --> 00:26.970]  With me, as always, Emily, my beautiful soon-to-be bride.
[00:28.090 --> 00:30.470]  And Gavin, sort of my life partner,
[00:31.610 --> 00:33.350]  and if things had worked out a little differently,
[00:33.430 --> 00:33.950]  maybe my bride.
[00:34.630 --> 00:35.150]  Nice to meet you.
[00:35.870 --> 00:37.230]  We have a special one today,
[00:37.230 --> 00:39.530]  and I apologise for how scatterbrained we're going to be,
[00:39.590 --> 00:41.210]  but we have so much to get through.
[00:42.350 --> 00:45.470]  First off, first and foremost, we're selling shit today.
[00:45.790 --> 00:48.470]  That's right. Today is the day that the...
[00:48.470 --> 00:49.910]  Oh, no, it's broken.
[00:50.470 --> 00:52.190]  Let me fix it. Figure out how to make money on this.
[00:52.250 --> 00:53.390]  I really want to.
[00:53.750 --> 00:54.750]  I got a screwdriver.
[00:55.150 --> 00:56.750]  Oh, you got a knife.
[00:56.770 --> 00:57.550]  Here, you're going to need to fix it.
[00:58.170 --> 01:01.870]  The Face Break show nacho helmet.
[01:02.190 --> 01:04.050]  We're selling these puppies on the...
[01:04.050 --> 01:06.210]  They go on sale at 4.10pm today.
[01:06.210 --> 01:09.990]  If you ever wanted to have a nacho helmet to put your nachos in,
[01:10.210 --> 01:11.630]  that's what it looks like.
[01:11.770 --> 01:14.150]  If you've ever eaten nachos outside of a helmet,
[01:14.450 --> 01:15.690]  you know what I'm talking about.
[01:15.810 --> 01:19.190]  It's not the same as nachos inside a helmet.
[01:19.330 --> 01:20.130]  They taste better.
[01:20.330 --> 01:22.070]  It's something about the plastic, the chemicals,
[01:22.490 --> 01:24.790]  the way it mixes with the refried beans and the cheese.
[01:25.150 --> 01:26.190]  Ice cream and popcorn.
[01:26.770 --> 01:27.450]  Oh, those are good.
[01:27.630 --> 01:27.890]  You mixed it?
[01:29.970 --> 01:31.370]  That was the only one I had.
[01:31.370 --> 01:33.750]  It was making too much noise.
[01:33.750 --> 01:35.050]  It was the only one of those I had left.
[01:36.730 --> 01:38.210]  That's OK. That's OK. No big deal.
[01:38.670 --> 01:41.510]  Anyway, so in about 10 minutes or so, if you want to buy a nacho helmet,
[01:41.650 --> 01:43.430]  it doesn't come with the nachos.
[01:44.350 --> 01:46.130]  Or a popcorn helmet, or an ice cream helmet,
[01:46.230 --> 01:48.610]  or what we decided earlier we're going to try.
[01:48.910 --> 01:50.390]  And it could be just a regular helmet.
[01:50.590 --> 01:52.450]  It could be a regular helmet with a flat...
[01:52.450 --> 01:54.250]  Like if you've got a particularly flat head
[01:54.250 --> 01:56.310]  and you've never been able to find a helmet that fits you better.
[01:56.910 --> 01:58.230]  There you go. It's for flat heads.
[01:59.390 --> 02:00.410]  It can be a dirt helmet.
[02:00.590 --> 02:02.930]  We also have decided that you could drink sodas out of it.
[02:03.470 --> 02:06.330]  But we don't know how many sodas it holds, so we're going to...
[02:06.330 --> 02:09.270]  Oh, how many do you think it holds?
[02:09.470 --> 02:10.630]  Five. Five?
[02:10.810 --> 02:11.710]  I said five.
[02:12.030 --> 02:13.130]  OK, and I'm going to take the over.
[02:13.450 --> 02:14.070]  You're going to take the over.
[02:14.190 --> 02:15.310]  So we're one in.
[02:15.770 --> 02:16.650]  So this is important.
[02:16.770 --> 02:18.990]  If you were thinking about buying a nacho helmet,
[02:19.110 --> 02:21.250]  but you were on the fence about how many sodas it could hold.
[02:21.490 --> 02:22.170]  Three way pour.
[02:22.330 --> 02:25.430]  Oh, it's our powers combining.
[02:25.790 --> 02:27.150]  This is so European of us.
[02:27.250 --> 02:27.970]  Look at us.
[02:28.650 --> 02:29.410]  Crossing streets.
[02:30.310 --> 02:30.970]  Oh my God.
[02:31.390 --> 02:32.810]  Wait, so don't tell Meg.
[02:33.150 --> 02:34.450]  All right, there we go.
[02:34.570 --> 02:35.390]  Got to let it settle.
[02:35.650 --> 02:37.110]  I let it settle. Let's see where we're at.
[02:37.170 --> 02:39.390]  We need those straws like we're at the like...
[02:39.390 --> 02:41.870]  Oh, too bad we don't have the Gerpler straws.
[02:42.450 --> 02:43.570]  When do those go on sale?
[02:43.630 --> 02:45.170]  So that's four. We're pretty close to full.
[02:45.250 --> 02:45.830]  This will be five.
[02:46.190 --> 02:48.570]  I think it's going to be exactly five.
[02:49.990 --> 02:50.930]  Don't do it. No, no, no.
[02:50.970 --> 02:51.430]  I got to drink that.
[02:51.530 --> 02:52.650]  There's still more.
[02:52.770 --> 02:53.930]  No, no, no, no, dude, we're at...
[02:53.930 --> 02:55.550]  You still have so much room over here.
[02:55.590 --> 02:56.250]  We're at capacity.
[02:56.510 --> 02:57.770]  Oh, God. Don't overfill.
[02:57.830 --> 02:59.650]  This is our only fuck face, Matt. Don't overfill it.
[02:59.650 --> 03:00.970]  Does it look like it's going to overfill?
[03:01.190 --> 03:02.070]  Well, we'll see.
[03:02.170 --> 03:02.550]  No way.
[03:03.470 --> 03:04.510]  You could put seven in there.
[03:04.650 --> 03:06.050]  It holds. It's a...
[03:06.050 --> 03:07.770]  Not only is it a nacho helmet,
[03:07.850 --> 03:08.910]  not only is it an ice cream helmet,
[03:08.990 --> 03:10.290]  not only is it a popcorn helmet,
[03:10.470 --> 03:12.470]  it's a six-pack holder.
[03:12.710 --> 03:13.550]  It could be a dog holder.
[03:13.730 --> 03:14.910]  That's like separate. Goddamn.
[03:16.050 --> 03:17.410]  So here, I'm going to go ahead and see.
[03:22.670 --> 03:22.990]  That's...
[03:22.990 --> 03:24.770]  Yeah, it tastes really good. It tastes even better.
[03:25.170 --> 03:25.610]  Does it?
[03:25.630 --> 03:26.650]  It tastes even better out of a helmet.
[03:26.830 --> 03:28.190]  It's something about the way the plastic mixes
[03:28.190 --> 03:29.410]  with the chemicals.
[03:29.410 --> 03:30.950]  So a Gerpler holds three.
[03:31.550 --> 03:33.030]  This holds five.
[03:33.170 --> 03:36.690]  I'm wondering if the shape of this allows for rimless entry.
[03:36.770 --> 03:38.530]  Do you think it's better to drink out of this side?
[03:38.590 --> 03:40.150]  Well, I think maybe just drink straight from the middle.
[03:40.650 --> 03:41.690]  Like a dog? Flap it?
[03:42.550 --> 03:43.730]  Well, I don't know why you would turn it that way,
[03:43.810 --> 03:44.270]  because now it's...
[03:44.930 --> 03:45.290]  God.
[03:45.830 --> 03:47.170]  Dip your beard in there.
[03:47.910 --> 03:49.790]  You'll get your beard in it a little bit, but...
[03:49.790 --> 03:50.570]  You want some dirt?
[03:51.290 --> 03:52.210]  It's fucking great.
[03:52.290 --> 03:55.210]  Yeah, maybe try sipping off the back rim.
[03:55.290 --> 03:55.770]  All right, I'll try that.
[03:56.770 --> 03:57.670]  I'll try to rim it.
[03:57.670 --> 03:59.270]  Oh, give it a rim job.
[03:59.770 --> 04:00.170]  Oh.
[04:02.410 --> 04:03.210]  Oh, God.
[04:03.390 --> 04:04.630]  Why does it look so wrong?
[04:04.650 --> 04:05.930]  You can see the flavor bubbles.
[04:06.530 --> 04:07.510]  That's how you know it tastes good.
[04:08.150 --> 04:08.910]  That's so much soda.
[04:09.150 --> 04:09.810]  Which way's better?
[04:10.610 --> 04:11.410]  This way's better.
[04:11.670 --> 04:11.990]  Okay.
[04:12.310 --> 04:13.430]  With the...
[04:13.430 --> 04:13.870]  Oh, my God.
[04:13.970 --> 04:16.130]  Turn to the side so you can see.
[04:16.550 --> 04:17.250]  Oh, yeah.
[04:17.510 --> 04:18.130]  There it is.
[04:19.090 --> 04:20.150]  Well, so that...
[04:20.150 --> 04:21.630]  Yeah, that's good stuff.
[04:21.690 --> 04:22.190]  That's good soda.
[04:22.430 --> 04:23.570]  Okay, let's put that over here for a minute.
[04:23.750 --> 04:24.670]  That's a good bowl.
[04:24.810 --> 04:25.610]  That's a great bowl.
[04:26.250 --> 04:27.870]  Oh, be careful with the...
[04:27.870 --> 04:28.650]  Don't get it in the dirt.
[04:28.670 --> 04:30.230]  It also holds bean hole dirt.
[04:30.330 --> 04:30.910]  Take a look at this.
[04:32.570 --> 04:33.450]  That's what I'm working on.
[04:33.610 --> 04:34.970]  Should we talk about that for a second?
[04:35.130 --> 04:35.250]  Okay.
[04:35.430 --> 04:35.630]  Yeah.
[04:35.810 --> 04:38.530]  So in about five minutes, you can buy that hat.
[04:38.590 --> 04:39.490]  I would recommend you do.
[04:39.570 --> 04:42.310]  We have, I think, a thousand of them because you guys were like,
[04:42.350 --> 04:43.130]  you never buy enough.
[04:43.250 --> 04:45.270]  So we made a thousand of those fucking things.
[04:45.510 --> 04:49.210]  So congratulations on the thousand of you that are going to get to get that.
[04:49.430 --> 04:50.250]  Do you want to try a nacho?
[04:51.030 --> 04:51.350]  No.
[04:51.710 --> 04:52.490]  In addition...
[04:52.490 --> 04:53.430]  I had one earlier.
[04:53.430 --> 04:58.310]  In addition, you can also buy the Ian Drops Acid Holiday Shirts.
[04:59.090 --> 05:00.570]  Yeah, go on a real trip.
[05:00.750 --> 05:01.890]  Yeah, go on a real trip.
[05:02.650 --> 05:03.790]  Ian's seeing all the colors.
[05:04.310 --> 05:06.650]  Also, there's a Gerpler beanie.
[05:06.790 --> 05:07.830]  Did you know we made a Gerpler beanie?
[05:08.030 --> 05:08.250]  No.
[05:08.390 --> 05:08.930]  I didn't either.
[05:08.970 --> 05:09.950]  You can be your own Gerpler.
[05:10.350 --> 05:10.950]  I love it.
[05:11.170 --> 05:12.430]  Your head is the Gerpler.
[05:12.430 --> 05:14.070]  Is that just a standard single size though?
[05:15.010 --> 05:15.410]  Okay.
[05:15.610 --> 05:15.870]  Okay.
[05:16.310 --> 05:18.230]  So what Gavin's referring to is...
[05:18.230 --> 05:19.350]  We're not going to open any cards today.
[05:19.350 --> 05:19.830]  We're just going to talk.
[05:20.770 --> 05:22.330]  What Gavin's referring to is...
[05:22.330 --> 05:25.190]  There is an episode of Face coming up.
[05:25.530 --> 05:27.450]  Not next week, but the week after, I believe.
[05:28.230 --> 05:28.930]  Maybe it's next week.
[05:29.630 --> 05:30.190]  It's next week.
[05:30.290 --> 05:31.350]  I think this week is buttholes.
[05:31.610 --> 05:33.570]  This week is buttholes, so it's next week.
[05:34.810 --> 05:35.950]  Gavin invents a product.
[05:36.810 --> 05:39.430]  Gavin and Tony invent a product that is maybe...
[05:39.430 --> 05:40.610]  We're going to change the world.
[05:40.750 --> 05:41.770]  We're going to change the world.
[05:42.890 --> 05:44.250]  And it's going to happen in two weeks.
[05:44.290 --> 05:45.110]  I'm very excited about it.
[05:45.170 --> 05:46.130]  It has to do with buttholes?
[05:46.330 --> 05:47.330]  Well, no, next week is buttholes.
[05:47.390 --> 05:48.350]  The week after that is headholes.
[05:48.550 --> 05:48.890]  Headholes.
[05:48.890 --> 05:53.370]  We invent a hat that is going to revolutionize hats.
[05:53.990 --> 05:56.870]  Is Andrew's face painted on it or printed on it?
[05:57.330 --> 05:59.070]  It's so good, it doesn't need to be.
[05:59.190 --> 06:00.150]  That's how good the hat is.
[06:00.270 --> 06:01.110]  Oh, God.
[06:01.530 --> 06:03.350]  But while I'm showing shit, let me show some other stuff.
[06:03.590 --> 06:04.970]  Do you know we have little Let's Play hats?
[06:05.110 --> 06:05.470]  That's cute.
[06:05.570 --> 06:06.110]  Oh, that rules.
[06:06.270 --> 06:06.790]  That is cool, right?
[06:06.790 --> 06:07.490]  You can have that if you want.
[06:08.290 --> 06:11.810]  And it goes with these cute little Let's Play embroidered shirts we have.
[06:12.010 --> 06:12.830]  Oh, I like the embroidery.
[06:12.870 --> 06:17.630]  If you ever thought to yourself, man, I used to love Let's Play and then I didn't anymore and now I do again,
[06:17.630 --> 06:18.510]  you can get this shirt.
[06:18.690 --> 06:21.210]  You could be like that guy that you talked to on customer service today.
[06:22.170 --> 06:23.670]  Oh, you got customer service, sir?
[06:24.050 --> 06:24.990]  Oh, I talked to...
[06:24.990 --> 06:27.950]  I had a long day of customer service, multiple times.
[06:28.070 --> 06:29.330]  Anyway, this cool Let's Play shirt.
[06:29.570 --> 06:30.430]  Gavin, I'm not done.
[06:30.770 --> 06:31.250]  Here, you can have that too.
[06:31.250 --> 06:31.710]  Can I wear that too?
[06:31.730 --> 06:32.650]  He's just getting started.
[06:33.030 --> 06:34.410]  All of my shirts are Sheevan Hunter.
[06:34.630 --> 06:39.930]  Not only do we have those cool new Let's Play shirts and the bean...
[06:39.930 --> 06:44.110]  not the beanhole hat, the nacho hat, although it could be a beanhole hat.
[06:44.530 --> 06:45.970]  You could put beans in it.
[06:45.970 --> 06:50.110]  What if we scanned the inside of the beanhole and reconstructed it as a hat?
[06:50.690 --> 06:51.710]  I think that's a great idea.
[06:51.790 --> 06:52.370]  That is a great idea.
[06:52.470 --> 06:53.970]  Like, make a mold and then, you know...
[06:53.970 --> 06:56.390]  And on the top would be rocks and dirt.
[06:57.650 --> 06:58.990]  We also have, Gavin...
[06:58.990 --> 07:04.450]  Not only do we have the Holiday Ian Drops acid and the Gerpler beanie, we also have...
[07:08.870 --> 07:11.890]  Geoff and Gavin and Eric at Sloppy Joe's.
[07:11.950 --> 07:13.230]  Have you seen this shirt?
[07:13.330 --> 07:14.170]  Can you believe it?
[07:14.170 --> 07:16.590]  It's almost like you're at our Bachelor Bachelorette party.
[07:16.870 --> 07:18.670]  If you wear this shirt, you can basically...
[07:18.670 --> 07:20.170]  You can say you were there.
[07:20.630 --> 07:22.990]  Look at us all wearing the wristbands for our hotel room.
[07:22.990 --> 07:24.410]  Look who's still wearing it.
[07:24.930 --> 07:26.470]  I'm still wearing my hotel wristband.
[07:26.590 --> 07:29.610]  He promised he'd take it off for the wedding, at least.
[07:29.630 --> 07:30.710]  He showers in it.
[07:31.270 --> 07:31.550]  Everything.
[07:31.550 --> 07:33.010]  I didn't say I would take it off for the wedding.
[07:33.110 --> 07:34.090]  I said I would wear it on my ankle.
[07:34.250 --> 07:35.090]  Oh, God.
[07:35.330 --> 07:36.570]  And then we said, okay, you can have this too, Gavin.
[07:36.950 --> 07:37.170]  Thank you.
[07:37.170 --> 07:39.010]  As long as I don't see it in the tux, I'm fine.
[07:39.150 --> 07:42.430]  We have all that shit for sale today in about two minutes.
[07:42.430 --> 07:45.650]  However, the big thing we're doing today...
[07:45.650 --> 07:48.310]  While I'm opening cards, you guys, you've got your tools ready.
[07:48.630 --> 07:49.310]  You're very excited.
[07:49.690 --> 07:53.550]  We're going to be filling bean hole pins with bean hole dirt.
[07:53.810 --> 07:55.410]  And we're going to talk a little bit about that.
[07:55.470 --> 07:57.690]  Why don't you zoom in right here and look at this thing.
[07:57.770 --> 07:58.390]  Isn't this beautiful?
[07:59.030 --> 07:59.850]  Look at that.
[08:00.070 --> 08:01.530]  Authentic bean hole dirt.
[08:01.950 --> 08:05.750]  Souvenir pin from the backyard of Geoff Ramsey, Austin, Texas.
[08:05.830 --> 08:06.690]  That's me right there.
[08:06.710 --> 08:08.710]  Oh, remember that time when only you dug the hole?
[08:09.470 --> 08:10.910]  There wasn't enough room for everybody.
[08:10.910 --> 08:13.090]  You dug the hole for one second.
[08:13.450 --> 08:14.870]  You had to film it.
[08:15.510 --> 08:17.210]  Put me filming on it then.
[08:18.070 --> 08:18.870]  It's on the back.
[08:19.650 --> 08:20.810]  This is you filling it.
[08:22.010 --> 08:24.130]  Anyway, this is the bean hole pin.
[08:24.230 --> 08:25.190]  This is not on sale today.
[08:25.290 --> 08:29.870]  This doesn't go on sale until December 5th because Gracie gave me a note.
[08:30.810 --> 08:33.270]  But we are going to be filling it with the dirt today.
[08:33.470 --> 08:37.150]  Now, Tony did a cool thing today, Gavin, that you're not aware of.
[08:37.290 --> 08:38.690]  We got all that bean hole dirt.
[08:38.790 --> 08:40.410]  We got buckets and buckets of dirt.
[08:40.410 --> 08:41.550]  We used the jackhammer.
[08:41.710 --> 08:43.710]  We'll talk about it on the Things podcast.
[08:43.830 --> 08:45.010]  We had a whole adventure.
[08:45.290 --> 08:46.930]  We captured the dirt.
[08:46.970 --> 08:48.070]  But the dirt was a little wet, right?
[08:48.130 --> 08:48.710]  It's moist.
[08:48.950 --> 08:49.450]  Ground's moist.
[08:49.530 --> 08:49.990]  It's been raining.
[08:50.250 --> 08:51.210]  So next week, butthole.
[08:51.310 --> 08:52.450]  The week after that, head hole.
[08:52.550 --> 08:53.570]  The week after that, bean hole.
[08:53.630 --> 08:54.130]  Bean hole, yeah.
[08:54.170 --> 08:54.950]  The week after that, bean hole.
[08:55.950 --> 08:59.570]  So Tony started filling these pins today and they got a little condensate-y, you know?
[08:59.650 --> 09:01.610]  Like when you'd screw it in because there's moisture.
[09:01.930 --> 09:04.770]  So he took all the bean hole dirt home and he cooked it in his oven.
[09:07.210 --> 09:08.750]  So his house smells real dirty.
[09:08.750 --> 09:10.930]  Because that's the real MVP right there.
[09:11.010 --> 09:11.790]  What did he preheat to?
[09:12.070 --> 09:12.530]  I don't know.
[09:12.590 --> 09:13.450]  I didn't ask him what temperature.
[09:13.810 --> 09:18.650]  But just rest assured, if you buy bean hole dirt, or if you buy the bean hole dirt pin,
[09:18.730 --> 09:20.790]  it's going to have cooked dirt in it.
[09:20.950 --> 09:25.090]  That's probably better for all the foreign bacteria that we're probably not going to ship now.
[09:25.190 --> 09:25.470]  Right.
[09:25.550 --> 09:28.230]  It's better for all the foreign bacteria that we're not going to ship because it all killed it.
[09:28.310 --> 09:28.670]  We're also...
[09:29.730 --> 09:30.130]  Listen.
[09:32.830 --> 09:37.250]  Really appreciate how everybody understands how international shipping works.
[09:37.250 --> 09:40.830]  But we are not going to be selling these bean hole pins internationally
[09:40.830 --> 09:44.110]  because so many comment leavers decided to get online and go like,
[09:44.390 --> 09:45.970]  did you know it's a big deal?
[09:46.070 --> 09:49.930]  And so instead of asking for forgiveness, now we just can't do it.
[09:50.010 --> 09:52.970]  Can't do it. Only for America. American made. American only.
[09:53.310 --> 09:57.270]  We can only ship the bean hole pins to America.
[09:57.450 --> 09:58.630]  So it'll be geo-locked.
[09:58.650 --> 10:00.170]  If you're outside of the States, I'm really sorry.
[10:00.270 --> 10:02.010]  I really wanted to send you my dirt,
[10:02.230 --> 10:05.750]  but a bunch of people online decided to talk about how illegal it is.
[10:05.770 --> 10:06.650]  And now we can't do it.
[10:06.650 --> 10:10.230]  I mean, what if we just sell BYOD pins?
[10:10.830 --> 10:11.510]  Bring your own dirt?
[10:11.730 --> 10:13.310]  Yeah, we thought about that.
[10:13.870 --> 10:14.830]  We talked about that with...
[10:14.830 --> 10:16.190]  Jordan and I talked about that today earlier,
[10:16.330 --> 10:20.610]  about maybe we just sell dirtless pins and then you insert your own dirt.
[10:20.690 --> 10:22.030]  But that just kind of kills the whole point.
[10:22.230 --> 10:24.590]  But that's only for people outside of America.
[10:24.850 --> 10:26.710]  You can't buy it if you're in America.
[10:26.910 --> 10:28.550]  If in America, you have to buy our dirt.
[10:28.890 --> 10:29.770]  You have to buy our dirt.
[10:29.930 --> 10:30.490]  And you're getting...
[10:30.490 --> 10:31.950]  I'll tell you, you're not just getting this dirt.
[10:32.070 --> 10:33.770]  You're getting a lot of hard work.
[10:34.250 --> 10:37.510]  Gavin and I and Eric, we swung a lot of pickaxes.
[10:37.770 --> 10:39.390]  We dug a lot of holes.
[10:39.550 --> 10:40.030]  We used the...
[10:40.030 --> 10:42.950]  I think everybody used the jackhammer at some point.
[10:43.250 --> 10:45.570]  And then this dirt went to Tony's house.
[10:45.690 --> 10:47.050]  It got baked in Tony's oven.
[10:47.150 --> 10:49.910]  And then it came back where it got filled lovingly by you two.
[10:50.030 --> 10:50.530]  Working on it.
[10:50.530 --> 10:51.150]  They're going to be working.
[10:51.270 --> 10:52.630]  They're going to be filling those beanhole pins.
[10:52.890 --> 10:54.930]  We also discovered today that...
[10:54.930 --> 10:55.750]  Do you have one of the...
[10:55.750 --> 11:01.310]  We also discovered today that one cool thing is this pin case.
[11:01.890 --> 11:03.510]  We didn't realize it, right?
[11:03.770 --> 11:04.950]  Perfect size for a card.
[11:05.050 --> 11:09.530]  So all the ones that we fill today, we're going to throw in cards from the collection.
[11:09.690 --> 11:11.650]  So I don't remember what this card is.
[11:11.650 --> 11:12.610]  Pete Yokovitch.
[11:13.050 --> 11:15.510]  Some of these are just some of our fun ones that we've opened.
[11:15.710 --> 11:17.290]  Like things like this one is Chili Davis.
[11:17.370 --> 11:19.330]  But I think I already had a Chili Davis in my collection.
[11:19.350 --> 11:20.110]  Right. His name is Food.
[11:20.250 --> 11:21.970]  So now someone else gets a name as Food.
[11:22.030 --> 11:25.550]  And maybe you'll also get the Jack Black from Anchorman.
[11:25.870 --> 11:26.270]  There you go.
[11:26.330 --> 11:26.750]  And maybe...
[11:27.410 --> 11:28.090]  So if you...
[11:28.090 --> 11:28.710]  Oh, yeah.
[11:28.710 --> 11:32.370]  We have a couple of these highly sought after...
[11:32.370 --> 11:33.110]  You can buy the merch now.
[11:33.430 --> 11:34.550]  Oh, the merch is available.
[11:34.650 --> 11:34.970]  You can buy it now.
[11:34.970 --> 11:35.630]  You can get it now.
[11:36.650 --> 11:38.870]  So, like, we have some Gertler cards, too.
[11:39.750 --> 11:43.450]  And we don't have the gold ones, but we have purple and green and red.
[11:43.550 --> 11:43.870]  Thank you.
[11:44.370 --> 11:45.010]  That's my first one.
[11:45.010 --> 11:48.410]  And so if you get a Beanhole pin and it's got a card on the back of it,
[11:48.430 --> 11:51.330]  you'll know it was filled by either Gavin or Emily on the show.
[11:51.410 --> 11:52.050]  Or right off.
[11:53.730 --> 11:55.730]  Okay, so the hats are now on sale.
[11:55.950 --> 11:56.810]  Hats are on sale.
[11:57.750 --> 11:58.890]  If only if you're watching live.
[11:59.070 --> 12:00.370]  Really, don't come with the nachos.
[12:00.470 --> 12:01.830]  You have to include your own nachos.
[12:02.010 --> 12:02.530]  $19.95.
[12:02.530 --> 12:03.990]  But you should also consider...
[12:03.990 --> 12:04.750]  B-Y-O-N.
[12:04.770 --> 12:05.470]  You can make a popcorn.
[12:05.730 --> 12:06.490]  You can make an ice cream.
[12:06.570 --> 12:07.370]  I would consider popcorn.
[12:07.490 --> 12:08.610]  I think that'd be a great popcorn receptacle.
[12:08.630 --> 12:10.130]  Also, we know it holds a six pack.
[12:10.230 --> 12:12.750]  So if you want to drink your sodas or your beers right out of the hat,
[12:13.570 --> 12:15.370]  we know that's safe.
[12:15.930 --> 12:17.990]  Instead of doing, like, the Edward Fortyhands,
[12:18.070 --> 12:20.290]  you just do, like, the six pack head.
[12:20.330 --> 12:22.730]  You know, that's the only time...
[12:22.730 --> 12:25.070]  I think the only time I've ever touched Gavin's dick
[12:25.410 --> 12:27.990]  was the Edward Fortyhands situation where I...
[12:27.990 --> 12:29.670]  Well, how else am I going to get it back in my pants?
[12:29.790 --> 12:30.550]  I mean, then he had to pee.
[12:30.950 --> 12:31.690]  So then I had to help him.
[12:31.690 --> 12:32.650]  I had to touch his little wiener.
[12:32.770 --> 12:33.530]  How was it?
[12:33.610 --> 12:33.890]  It was okay.
[12:34.050 --> 12:36.630]  I don't think you touched the physical wiener.
[12:36.670 --> 12:37.270]  I told you I didn't.
[12:37.370 --> 12:42.010]  Is that influencing any of your current writing that you're doing?
[12:43.130 --> 12:43.850]  That hasn't...
[12:43.850 --> 12:44.490]  I don't know if it's coming...
[12:44.490 --> 12:46.410]  I don't know anything about it, but...
[12:46.410 --> 12:47.130]  Has that come out?
[12:47.330 --> 12:48.190]  Yeah, I think so.
[12:48.330 --> 12:50.550]  Listen to Clutch My Pearls, the podcast about smut,
[12:50.630 --> 12:53.150]  where my friends tell me all about the dirty little books
[12:53.150 --> 12:55.090]  that they're reading and that Geoff's super jealous of
[12:55.090 --> 12:57.290]  because he wants to be all bad boy.
[12:57.770 --> 12:58.430]  I am a bad boy.
[12:58.450 --> 12:59.210]  He's a bad boy.
[12:59.210 --> 13:00.550]  He's been a bad boy around.
[13:00.650 --> 13:01.450]  He's a mean boy.
[13:01.450 --> 13:03.450]  The other night, Emily asked me for water.
[13:04.210 --> 13:05.970]  She was in bed and she was like,
[13:06.030 --> 13:08.010]  can I have some water to take my medicine with?
[13:08.290 --> 13:08.990]  And I was like...
[13:08.990 --> 13:10.130]  Because I'm not mentally well.
[13:10.210 --> 13:11.270]  Because I was also in bed.
[13:11.350 --> 13:13.710]  So I'm like, yeah, sure, I'll get up to get your water
[13:13.710 --> 13:15.690]  so that you forgot for your medicine
[13:15.690 --> 13:17.190]  so that you don't have to get up.
[13:17.350 --> 13:17.530]  Right.
[13:17.810 --> 13:19.270]  So I went and you know what I did?
[13:20.070 --> 13:21.590]  I microwaved the water to make it hot.
[13:21.770 --> 13:22.570]  And then I gave it to her.
[13:22.710 --> 13:23.750]  And she's like, what the fuck is this?
[13:23.770 --> 13:24.810]  And I was like, evil boy.
[13:24.930 --> 13:25.730]  He's a bad boy.
[13:25.870 --> 13:27.670]  I'm like a bad boy in those books you watch.
[13:28.750 --> 13:29.630]  Are told about.
[13:29.630 --> 13:32.010]  Bring me warm water, because that's what bad boys do.
[13:32.090 --> 13:32.950]  It's enemies to lovers.
[13:33.090 --> 13:34.350]  So we have to be enemies first.
[13:34.550 --> 13:35.710]  The other day she was taking a shower.
[13:36.150 --> 13:37.350]  I filled a glass full of...
[13:37.350 --> 13:38.770]  I filled a Gerpler full of cold water.
[13:39.010 --> 13:40.710]  And I walked in and just threw it on her in the shower.
[13:41.570 --> 13:43.050]  Yeah, that's what evil boys do.
[13:43.270 --> 13:44.050]  I'm an evil dirty boy.
[13:44.090 --> 13:44.430]  I don't care.
[13:45.670 --> 13:46.110]  I drink.
[13:46.130 --> 13:46.410]  I drink.
[13:46.410 --> 13:46.930]  Oh, no.
[13:47.630 --> 13:48.750]  There's pubes in it.
[13:48.870 --> 13:49.790]  That's not pubes.
[13:50.010 --> 13:50.370]  That's...
[13:50.370 --> 13:50.970]  Is it from you?
[13:51.450 --> 13:51.810]  No.
[13:52.870 --> 13:53.290]  That's a...
[13:53.290 --> 13:53.850]  That's a pube.
[13:54.950 --> 13:56.830]  Did you pube the dirt?
[13:57.010 --> 13:59.150]  That is where you go pee sometimes after a bike ride.
[13:59.150 --> 14:00.310]  Did you pube the dirt, Tony?
[14:00.610 --> 14:03.810]  Tony did mention something about jacking off into the bulls.
[14:04.030 --> 14:04.330]  So...
[14:04.330 --> 14:05.630]  I said there'll be no cum in these.
[14:05.850 --> 14:06.870]  He did say that.
[14:07.970 --> 14:09.710]  Let's open up some cards while you guys are doing that.
[14:09.770 --> 14:10.450]  Here's the pack sack.
[14:10.570 --> 14:11.410]  Everybody loves pack sack.
[14:11.530 --> 14:13.090]  I can't believe we're 15 minutes into the show.
[14:13.150 --> 14:14.250]  We haven't opened up any cards yet.
[14:14.410 --> 14:15.050]  That's on me.
[14:15.750 --> 14:16.950]  I'm just excited about the helmet.
[14:17.290 --> 14:17.570]  I'm gonna...
[14:17.570 --> 14:19.370]  We're gonna open up whatever the fuck that is.
[14:19.430 --> 14:20.870]  I'm excited about the pens that we can't sell.
[14:21.230 --> 14:22.930]  And we can sell them.
[14:23.010 --> 14:24.130]  We just can't sell them outside of America.
[14:24.270 --> 14:25.210]  And we're gonna build these three.
[14:25.790 --> 14:26.510]  Oh, Christ.
[14:26.610 --> 14:28.230]  That's a desert storm.
[14:29.430 --> 14:30.150]  Thank you.
[14:30.250 --> 14:30.850]  All right.
[14:30.870 --> 14:32.950]  Let's see what's in the bullshit desert storm cards.
[14:33.050 --> 14:34.050]  Were you in desert storm?
[14:34.130 --> 14:35.270]  I was not.
[14:35.450 --> 14:35.810]  I was...
[14:35.810 --> 14:36.950]  I just missed it, actually.
[14:37.150 --> 14:37.750]  But wasn't...
[14:37.750 --> 14:38.970]  Kuwait's not desert storm?
[14:39.250 --> 14:40.510]  Well, desert storm was a war.
[14:40.990 --> 14:41.470]  I don't know.
[14:41.470 --> 14:42.190]  I was in Kuwait.
[14:42.830 --> 14:43.110]  That...
[14:43.110 --> 14:43.870]  What was the name of your war?
[14:43.870 --> 14:44.910]  Desert storm was in 1990.
[14:45.010 --> 14:45.370]  I wasn't...
[14:45.370 --> 14:46.650]  I didn't serve during my war.
[14:46.950 --> 14:48.090]  But you were in Kuwait doing...
[14:48.090 --> 14:48.950]  And they were in Panama.
[14:49.290 --> 14:50.510]  Panama was like something different.
[14:50.550 --> 14:50.910]  But like...
[14:50.910 --> 14:51.470]  I was in Kuwait...
[14:52.450 --> 14:53.170]  a lot.
[14:53.270 --> 14:54.690]  Oh, this person's getting the Giamatti.
[14:54.930 --> 14:55.130]  Yeah.
[14:55.290 --> 14:56.490]  I was three...
[14:56.490 --> 14:57.370]  three times I went to Kuwait.
[14:57.370 --> 14:59.770]  But it was after the Gulf War.
[14:59.790 --> 15:00.490]  Gulf War.
[15:00.690 --> 15:00.810]  Yeah.
[15:00.830 --> 15:01.950]  Which was desert storm.
[15:02.090 --> 15:02.470]  Okay.
[15:02.790 --> 15:03.550]  Which was this.
[15:03.830 --> 15:04.730]  Flying Eye, F-18.
[15:05.730 --> 15:06.710]  Paratrooper in flight.
[15:07.330 --> 15:07.910]  Thank you.
[15:08.070 --> 15:09.170]  Army supply ship.
[15:09.190 --> 15:09.830]  You're really good at this.
[15:11.310 --> 15:12.190]  Airborne unit.
[15:13.310 --> 15:15.210]  This little funnel, by the way, is phenomenal.
[15:15.350 --> 15:17.670]  CH-53 Super Stallion.
[15:17.810 --> 15:19.090]  Oh, that's a fat helicopter.
[15:19.210 --> 15:19.630]  That's cool.
[15:19.690 --> 15:20.630]  That's a good little funnel.
[15:21.570 --> 15:22.450]  Machine gunner.
[15:22.870 --> 15:24.650]  You're not supposed to be downrange of a...
[15:24.650 --> 15:25.910]  fucking weapon pointed at you.
[15:26.150 --> 15:26.590]  Ridiculous.
[15:26.750 --> 15:27.190]  So...
[15:27.190 --> 15:30.190]  EA-6B Prowler and Marine Firefighters.
[15:30.270 --> 15:31.010]  I bet...
[15:31.010 --> 15:33.550]  I bet they got a lot of these images from art journalists.
[15:33.690 --> 15:34.470]  I was about to ask that.
[15:34.570 --> 15:35.730]  I bet it's my people who probably made these.
[15:35.770 --> 15:37.710]  Is that your little banner that they have?
[15:38.390 --> 15:40.750]  No, this is the 8th Field Artillery.
[15:40.950 --> 15:42.250]  I was 1st Cavalry Division.
[15:42.550 --> 15:43.530]  But you never rode a horse.
[15:43.630 --> 15:43.950]  1st Team.
[15:44.470 --> 15:44.990]  Yeah, I did.
[15:45.170 --> 15:45.970]  You rode a horse?
[15:46.070 --> 15:46.450]  In the Army.
[15:46.810 --> 15:46.970]  Yeah.
[15:47.030 --> 15:47.250]  Really?
[15:47.450 --> 15:47.870]  A couple times.
[15:47.990 --> 15:49.290]  In your, like, Army outfit and everything?
[15:49.790 --> 15:51.970]  Well, yeah, to take pictures of other dudes riding horses.
[15:52.270 --> 15:54.250]  But were you in camo or were you in, like, a uniform?
[15:54.410 --> 15:54.930]  In camouflage.
[15:55.970 --> 15:56.410]  That's cool.
[15:56.410 --> 15:57.690]  Were the horses in camo?
[15:57.870 --> 15:59.770]  No, they were nudie-poodie.
[16:00.950 --> 16:03.970]  Whenever the subject of cooking comes up, your name is always mentioned.
[16:04.070 --> 16:05.230]  What the fuck am I opening?
[16:06.070 --> 16:07.390]  Gruesome greeting cards.
[16:07.710 --> 16:07.890]  Okay.
[16:08.410 --> 16:11.010]  Oh, so it's like, everyone is a, like, sarcastic greeting?
[16:11.350 --> 16:11.930]  Yeah, I think so.
[16:12.050 --> 16:12.370]  Hard to open.
[16:12.370 --> 16:13.990]  Are these ones that we're gonna be able to even show?
[16:14.090 --> 16:15.310]  Or do we need to proofread them first?
[16:15.830 --> 16:17.690]  Because your cooking always comes up!
[16:19.870 --> 16:21.690]  I'm gonna put some of these in people's pens.
[16:22.210 --> 16:24.510]  Your eyes are like perfect blue oceans.
[16:24.570 --> 16:26.170]  Your hair is like spun gold.
[16:26.170 --> 16:28.010]  Your skin is like fine China.
[16:29.550 --> 16:30.930]  I feel like a watchmaker.
[16:32.270 --> 16:33.770]  Like a little Swiss watchmaker?
[16:34.030 --> 16:34.150]  Yeah.
[16:34.290 --> 16:38.130]  And if you only had more than one tooth in your mouth, I might ask you out.
[16:38.430 --> 16:38.970]  Oh, goodness.
[16:40.410 --> 16:41.190]  That's rude.
[16:42.490 --> 16:44.030]  What is it, the anti-dentite?
[16:45.150 --> 16:49.130]  I love your eyes and face and hair and lips as sweet as honey.
[16:49.290 --> 16:50.930]  More than these, my darling bride.
[16:50.990 --> 16:52.710]  Oh, this could be what I could say to you at the wedding.
[16:52.970 --> 16:54.070]  Perfect, that's your vows.
[16:54.430 --> 16:56.030]  And then on the inside, is it what I say?
[16:56.570 --> 16:58.350]  I love your family's money.
[17:00.810 --> 17:04.010]  That'd be cool if you both had to like find your vows out in the world.
[17:04.190 --> 17:06.110]  Should we just do AI for our vows?
[17:06.510 --> 17:06.630]  Yeah.
[17:07.550 --> 17:11.510]  But just put that in there, like make something that goes with loving the family's money.
[17:11.950 --> 17:12.990]  Oh, God, these are stuck.
[17:17.270 --> 17:18.930]  So far, only one pube.
[17:19.850 --> 17:20.510]  That's good.
[17:20.670 --> 17:20.830]  Yep.
[17:21.850 --> 17:23.930]  That little hat's working so well for your little hat.
[17:23.930 --> 17:24.830]  These are so...
[17:24.830 --> 17:26.150]  All right, I can't even open these.
[17:26.190 --> 17:26.850]  They're so cute.
[17:26.850 --> 17:27.530]  Let's see.
[17:27.590 --> 17:30.130]  Tony went to a yard sale over the weekend and he bought a bunch of weird cards.
[17:30.570 --> 17:31.510]  Let's see what he got.
[17:32.110 --> 17:32.830]  He gave them to me.
[17:32.890 --> 17:36.750]  How about American Bandstand featuring Dick Clark?
[17:37.070 --> 17:38.230]  Gold foil autograph.
[17:38.350 --> 17:38.890]  Oh, that's good.
[17:39.010 --> 17:39.350]  Special offer.
[17:39.490 --> 17:39.970]  See back.
[17:40.130 --> 17:41.510]  Eight premium collector cards.
[17:41.630 --> 17:44.050]  So American Bandstand, that was...
[17:44.050 --> 17:44.430]  Dick Clark.
[17:44.730 --> 17:47.370]  Yeah, but I didn't really know him from like Rockin' New Year's Eve.
[17:47.550 --> 17:47.710]  Yeah.
[17:47.950 --> 17:48.970]  And then, but he didn't...
[17:48.970 --> 17:50.090]  Which was an offshoot of American Bandstand.
[17:50.310 --> 17:51.330]  But that was at every night?
[17:51.390 --> 17:52.130]  Was it like Soul Train?
[17:53.070 --> 17:53.970]  Yeah, I think so.
[17:54.590 --> 17:55.290]  I don't know if it was every night.
[17:55.370 --> 17:56.050]  I think it was like once a week.
[17:56.050 --> 17:56.590]  Okay.
[17:56.850 --> 17:58.110]  Lou Rawls.
[17:59.430 --> 18:01.290]  American Bandstand 10th anniversary.
[18:02.070 --> 18:03.070]  There's Dick Clark right there.
[18:04.010 --> 18:05.110]  Melissa Manchester.
[18:06.090 --> 18:07.450]  Ooh, Gloria Gaynor.
[18:08.310 --> 18:09.490]  Frankie Valli.
[18:10.170 --> 18:12.570]  The man himself, Dick Clark.
[18:12.930 --> 18:13.170]  Hey.
[18:13.470 --> 18:14.870]  What's a good Gloria Gaynor song?
[18:15.530 --> 18:17.070]  Didn't she do like...
[18:17.070 --> 18:17.930]  What a feeling.
[18:20.140 --> 18:21.320]  She did one of the songs.
[18:21.520 --> 18:25.780]  Gloria Gaynor has been dubbed the queen of soul and dance for her international hits
[18:25.780 --> 18:31.160]  such as Never Can Say Goodbye, Reach Out, I'll Be There, I Am What I Am, and I Will Survive.
[18:31.200 --> 18:31.940]  Oh, I Will Survive.
[18:33.720 --> 18:34.840]  She was afraid at first.
[18:35.000 --> 18:35.720]  Cool in the gang.
[18:36.040 --> 18:38.260]  I Will Survive might be the most sampled song in history.
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.100]  I wonder what the most sampled song in history is and if it's that.
[18:41.720 --> 18:42.400]  It's everywhere.
[18:42.700 --> 18:45.780]  Emily, he also had these in here and I thought, oh, I have to open...
[18:45.780 --> 18:47.420]  Oh, these are cool.
[18:48.580 --> 18:49.340]  Here's Bo.
[18:50.300 --> 18:53.160]  Photo cards by John Derrick plus poster inside.
[18:54.260 --> 18:54.980]  Here's Bo.
[18:54.980 --> 18:55.580]  Okay.
[18:56.240 --> 18:57.820]  What the fuck that means?
[18:59.040 --> 19:01.600]  Do you think if you planted this dirt, anything would come up?
[19:02.980 --> 19:04.080]  How big of a...
[19:04.080 --> 19:04.960]  How much of a...
[19:05.360 --> 19:06.140]  It came with a poster.
[19:06.500 --> 19:07.420]  Problem would be.
[19:09.680 --> 19:10.880]  Oh, that's cool.
[19:10.940 --> 19:14.060]  It's a picture of Bo Derrick in NASA.
[19:14.540 --> 19:15.220]  From Tommy Boy?
[19:15.360 --> 19:17.440]  Yeah, that's all she's known for.
[19:19.420 --> 19:20.220]  Let's see.
[19:21.140 --> 19:22.020]  Now, shit.
[19:23.060 --> 19:25.420]  Movie 10 brings international fame.
[19:25.880 --> 19:27.080]  Is that when she had the braids?
[19:28.200 --> 19:30.100]  That was Bolero that she had the braids, I think.
[19:30.920 --> 19:31.840]  To the Rescue.
[19:32.340 --> 19:33.160]  Or was it in 10 as well?
[19:33.240 --> 19:33.700]  It might have been 10.
[19:34.700 --> 19:36.360]  Bo was an excellent windsurfer.
[19:37.480 --> 19:38.960]  Bo's husband, John Derrick.
[19:39.540 --> 19:42.420]  Now, I believe...
[19:43.340 --> 19:45.760]  I could be wrong about this, so don't sue me.
[19:45.760 --> 19:54.940]  But I'm pretty sure Bo Derrick and John Derrick got married when she was like 16, 17.
[19:55.460 --> 19:59.960]  It was one of those things that was not okay, but everybody turned a blind eye to in the 70s.
[20:00.020 --> 20:04.280]  But now people recognize it as seriously problematic and illegal.
[20:04.680 --> 20:07.100]  But yeah, I think she was with him when she was still in school.
[20:08.280 --> 20:08.320]  Yikes.
[20:09.680 --> 20:10.540]  That's a big yike.
[20:10.640 --> 20:12.200]  Resting after a jog on the beach.
[20:12.900 --> 20:15.360]  So the name of the show is Here's Bo.
[20:15.760 --> 20:17.220]  Was it like her reality show?
[20:18.520 --> 20:22.240]  She was so popular that they made trading cards for all the movies that she was in.
[20:22.740 --> 20:27.440]  And they probably were sanctioned by John Derrick because after they became a couple,
[20:27.700 --> 20:31.060]  I want to say she only made movies for him.
[20:31.840 --> 20:35.300]  She was like a promising up-and-coming actress and then they fell in love
[20:35.300 --> 20:36.800]  and then he started making her movies.
[20:37.280 --> 20:39.340]  And then they started making independent films.
[20:39.480 --> 20:41.860]  I want to say some people didn't want to work with him anymore
[20:41.860 --> 20:44.160]  because it was weird that he was married to a child bride.
[20:44.520 --> 20:48.220]  And so they started to make independent movies, which were quite successful, I believe.
[20:48.700 --> 20:50.680]  But anyway, I think that they only worked together for a long time.
[20:50.760 --> 20:51.280]  And that's why.
[20:51.440 --> 20:53.300]  So these are probably just all the movies that he made with her.
[20:53.660 --> 20:55.080]  Speaking of the braids, there they are.
[20:55.280 --> 20:55.660]  Oh, yeah.
[20:55.740 --> 20:56.840]  Do you think that was a Derrick Derrick?
[20:57.480 --> 20:58.040]  Derrick Derrick?
[20:58.180 --> 20:58.860]  I think they're definitely...
[20:58.860 --> 20:59.580]  Probably their son.
[20:59.800 --> 21:00.880]  Oh, I hope he's not dead.
[21:01.540 --> 21:01.860]  Oh.
[21:02.100 --> 21:02.740]  Monkeys are sad.
[21:02.800 --> 21:04.540]  You want to throw a Derrick in there?
[21:04.680 --> 21:04.920]  I do.
[21:05.820 --> 21:06.620]  All right, those are cool.
[21:06.740 --> 21:08.620]  And now here's the ones that I knew you'd be excited about.
[21:10.240 --> 21:10.880]  Branson Onstage!
[21:11.480 --> 21:13.320]  Oh my god, I love it.
[21:13.320 --> 21:15.400]  I want to go...
[21:15.400 --> 21:20.700]  I grew up going to Silver Dollar City and I'm going to take Geoff there someday, but he's scared.
[21:21.240 --> 21:22.220]  And I love it.
[21:22.280 --> 21:22.780]  It is a...
[21:23.940 --> 21:28.220]  It's the Nashville with very strong Christian undertones.
[21:29.200 --> 21:29.900]  And a lot of families...
[21:30.420 --> 21:31.660]  The more family-friendly Nashville.
[21:31.820 --> 21:35.960]  A lot of families where there's a lot of children, a lot of long denim skirts,
[21:36.160 --> 21:40.160]  a lot of long hair that's just kind of modestly pinned up.
[21:40.220 --> 21:40.680]  A lot of gig'em.
[21:40.680 --> 21:43.540]  A lot of just the family band.
[21:43.840 --> 21:46.200]  Speaking of the family band, how about the Lowe Sisters?
[21:46.440 --> 21:47.420]  Yep, there we go.
[21:47.760 --> 21:50.200]  They may be Lowe Sisters, but they have high hair.
[21:50.420 --> 21:52.900]  Yeah, the best ride at Silver Dollar City is Fire in the Hole.
[21:53.140 --> 21:53.920]  Mark Jones?
[21:54.380 --> 21:54.660]  Yeah.
[21:54.800 --> 21:55.420]  He probably rode it.
[21:55.600 --> 21:56.700]  Here's the Moffett Brothers.
[21:57.140 --> 21:57.480]  Yep.
[21:57.660 --> 21:57.880]  Oh.
[21:58.280 --> 22:00.880]  Everybody loves the Foggy River Boys.
[22:01.200 --> 22:02.560]  Moffett Brothers sounds familiar.
[22:03.080 --> 22:04.660]  The old Foggy River Boys.
[22:05.300 --> 22:06.360]  There's Michael Rogers.
[22:07.080 --> 22:08.640]  That's a lot of...
[22:08.640 --> 22:09.280]  Here we go.
[22:09.280 --> 22:10.640]  Oh, Dick Kurlis.
[22:10.980 --> 22:11.720]  Oh, okay.
[22:11.760 --> 22:12.680]  That's got to go in a card.
[22:12.820 --> 22:13.320]  I gotta take that.
[22:13.440 --> 22:14.120]  Thank you.
[22:14.120 --> 22:15.360]  Someone's getting that in their pen.
[22:15.940 --> 22:16.720]  Oh, shit.
[22:17.760 --> 22:18.200]  What?
[22:18.640 --> 22:19.380]  Mike Gavin.
[22:20.120 --> 22:21.280]  Oh, my God.
[22:21.320 --> 22:22.140]  Look at the mullet.
[22:22.740 --> 22:23.260]  On you?
[22:23.560 --> 22:23.920]  On him?
[22:24.020 --> 22:24.360]  On him.
[22:24.580 --> 22:27.100]  Dude, you should go as Mike Gavin some year.
[22:27.260 --> 22:28.020]  Do we have a mullet pile?
[22:28.020 --> 22:28.600]  Name, not name?
[22:29.540 --> 22:30.100]  We should.
[22:30.620 --> 22:33.100]  Oh, everybody remembers Furlan Husky.
[22:33.500 --> 22:34.080]  Oh, yeah.
[22:34.400 --> 22:35.080]  Old Furlan.
[22:35.100 --> 22:35.760]  Good old Furlan.
[22:36.080 --> 22:37.300]  Hey, the Osmond Brothers.
[22:37.840 --> 22:39.380]  Is it like the Donny Osmonds?
[22:39.700 --> 22:40.680]  Like the other Osmonds?
[22:40.720 --> 22:41.720]  Like without the sister?
[22:41.720 --> 22:42.880]  Like the Jacksons, yeah.
[22:43.640 --> 22:44.540]  Yeah, I guess so.
[22:45.320 --> 22:48.580]  And then the Brashler Music Show.
[22:49.160 --> 22:50.180]  Those guys look like fun.
[22:50.400 --> 22:50.620]  Look at that guy.
[22:50.640 --> 22:51.000]  Hell, yeah.
[22:51.460 --> 22:52.360]  He's a blast.
[22:53.260 --> 22:53.620]  All right.
[22:53.680 --> 22:57.860]  Well, that was the Branson onstage cards.
[22:58.780 --> 22:59.880]  Also has this thing.
[23:00.200 --> 23:01.080]  United States of Alf.
[23:01.420 --> 23:03.920]  Five super stickers for a series called 50 States.
[23:04.020 --> 23:06.420]  We should put those in the cards because it's for American only.
[23:06.920 --> 23:07.780]  Oh, that's true.
[23:08.080 --> 23:09.780]  Made by a British person, though.
[23:10.900 --> 23:11.760]  Let's see what we have.
[23:12.360 --> 23:13.040]  U.S. of Alf.
[23:13.160 --> 23:15.860]  I want you to collect all 50 states.
[23:16.360 --> 23:17.260]  That's my Alf impression.
[23:18.240 --> 23:19.660]  I can't even send that to my people.
[23:19.760 --> 23:20.780]  Kentucky, land of the pioneers.
[23:21.160 --> 23:22.180]  You could if they're...
[23:22.180 --> 23:22.540]  Is it?
[23:22.760 --> 23:23.140]  Pennsylvania.
[23:23.220 --> 23:24.180]  Don't open it.
[23:24.780 --> 23:25.740]  See, New Hampshire.
[23:26.100 --> 23:28.140]  If they open it, then it's like chemical warfare.
[23:28.300 --> 23:28.560]  Georgian.
[23:28.560 --> 23:29.500]  Or bio warfare.
[23:31.560 --> 23:32.520]  All right, here we go.
[23:32.840 --> 23:36.140]  Like, what about when we go to, you know, Key West or whatever and they're like,
[23:36.140 --> 23:39.100]  here's some sand to take home in your little seashells.
[23:39.160 --> 23:40.760]  Yeah, but we're taking it from Key West to Austin.
[23:41.020 --> 23:42.580]  Did you take some sand from Key West?
[23:42.660 --> 23:44.700]  No, but you know, you're in the gift shops where they'll be like...
[23:45.320 --> 23:46.040]  Dude, be cool.
[23:46.840 --> 23:50.360]  Where they'll have, like, a little thing and it's like seashells and shit.
[23:50.800 --> 23:51.360]  And then you're like...
[23:51.360 --> 23:53.100]  But if you do that outside of America...
[23:53.100 --> 23:53.980]  Dude, we can't even take...
[23:54.640 --> 23:57.840]  They don't even let you take shit in and out of Hawaii from America.
[23:58.100 --> 23:59.680]  Like, they take that shit seriously, unfortunately.
[23:59.980 --> 24:00.900]  I mean, I appreciate it.
[24:00.940 --> 24:01.560]  There's a reason.
[24:01.720 --> 24:02.960]  I don't need to be educated on it.
[24:03.040 --> 24:05.300]  But it's just like, you know, I just want everyone to play.
[24:05.300 --> 24:06.480]  Opening some real cards now.
[24:06.520 --> 24:11.060]  These are Top's Finest OTE Overtime cards.
[24:11.460 --> 24:12.120]  Rob Dillingham.
[24:12.180 --> 24:12.680]  Oh, we got an autograph.
[24:13.320 --> 24:13.960]  Bryson Tiller.
[24:14.180 --> 24:14.900]  Wait, Dillingham?
[24:15.160 --> 24:15.360]  Yeah.
[24:15.420 --> 24:17.040]  We have a Dill-based name collection?
[24:17.060 --> 24:18.160]  We should have a Dill-based name collection.
[24:18.400 --> 24:19.180]  Let's put it in the Dill pile.
[24:19.220 --> 24:19.460]  In the pickles?
[24:19.540 --> 24:20.700]  The Dill pile.
[24:20.800 --> 24:21.400]  There's T. Smith.
[24:22.680 --> 24:23.220]  That's cool.
[24:23.540 --> 24:25.020]  Yeah, here, do you want to put this in the Dill pile?
[24:25.860 --> 24:26.620]  Start a Dill pile.
[24:28.160 --> 24:29.440]  Here's another Dill card.
[24:29.680 --> 24:29.980]  There's two.
[24:30.460 --> 24:32.040]  Are they two different Dills or the same Dill?
[24:33.320 --> 24:34.040]  Are they brother Dills?
[24:34.040 --> 24:34.920]  What is...
[24:36.340 --> 24:38.380]  It's the same card flipped.
[24:38.980 --> 24:39.380]  Whoa.
[24:39.560 --> 24:40.400]  Dude, double Dill?
[24:40.560 --> 24:41.340]  Double Dill.
[24:41.800 --> 24:42.540]  Hell yeah.
[24:43.860 --> 24:45.120]  This is the same person.
[24:45.220 --> 24:46.260]  They're holding the basketball different.
[24:46.380 --> 24:46.940]  It's the same person.
[24:47.040 --> 24:47.720]  It's just different pose.
[24:47.760 --> 24:48.800]  Is it Rob and Bob Dill?
[24:49.140 --> 24:50.500]  No, it's Rob Dill and Rob Dill.
[24:52.280 --> 24:52.720]  There you go.
[24:53.040 --> 24:53.760]  Sleep all these out.
[24:53.760 --> 24:56.900]  What a treat for a double Dill to be the beginning of our Dill pile.
[24:57.140 --> 24:57.620]  Double Dill.
[24:57.700 --> 24:58.700]  So these are college kids?
[24:58.700 --> 24:59.500]  It's a great way to...
[24:59.500 --> 25:01.120]  Yeah, or OT, Overtime Elite.
[25:01.220 --> 25:01.820]  I think it's like a...
[25:02.740 --> 25:04.560]  Would a Web and Yama be in here?
[25:05.840 --> 25:07.180]  That's probably why I bought them.
[25:08.980 --> 25:10.800]  Boam and Chrome basketball.
[25:11.060 --> 25:14.820]  These are more Wimby potentials.
[25:14.980 --> 25:16.860]  We're like 25 minutes into this now.
[25:17.180 --> 25:20.220]  And these pens are going to take a really long time.
[25:20.520 --> 25:21.400]  Oscar Sweeby.
[25:21.600 --> 25:22.060]  We'll be here all night.
[25:22.500 --> 25:23.420]  Judah Mintz.
[25:23.860 --> 25:26.440]  We are going to be here for the break show.
[25:26.840 --> 25:28.340]  Maybe we can work on them on that.
[25:28.420 --> 25:29.760]  Not the break show, I'm sorry.
[25:30.140 --> 25:31.340]  The Extra Life.
[25:31.340 --> 25:32.140]  Oh, Leah Boston.
[25:32.380 --> 25:34.200]  And we're not going to be here next week or the week after.
[25:34.700 --> 25:38.660]  Yeah, so if you are around this weekend, tune in to Extra Life.
[25:38.720 --> 25:43.920]  I think Saturday at 8.30 p.m. to about 11, we're going to be doing a special break show.
[25:44.360 --> 25:45.340]  8.30 to 10, I'm sorry.
[25:45.840 --> 25:49.420]  We're going to do a special break show and we're just going to try to empty the pack sack.
[25:49.680 --> 25:50.960]  Pop the sack.
[25:51.320 --> 25:54.260]  We're going to try to empty the pack sack and we're also going to shred some Pokémon cards
[25:54.260 --> 25:55.780]  or something or preserve them.
[25:56.720 --> 25:58.620]  So hopefully, and it'll all be for charity.
[25:58.620 --> 26:03.960]  So hopefully, you'll come hang out and if you are so inclined, donate some money to Sick Kids.
[26:04.600 --> 26:07.300]  But also, next week, we will not be doing the break show.
[26:07.620 --> 26:10.520]  I apologize, but everybody's going to have off because of Extra Life.
[26:10.620 --> 26:11.200]  Everybody needs a break.
[26:11.320 --> 26:13.440]  And then the next week, we won't be here because it's Thanksgiving.
[26:14.560 --> 26:15.380]  And we're here in America.
[26:15.720 --> 26:17.860]  Yeah, so sorry about that.
[26:18.180 --> 26:19.920]  The land of bean hole dirt.
[26:20.600 --> 26:23.380]  But you are getting two break shows this week, technically, if you tune in Saturday night.
[26:25.120 --> 26:25.920]  Fimi Odikale.
[26:26.280 --> 26:27.880]  Do you know what's crazy right now?
[26:28.040 --> 26:28.180]  What?
[26:28.740 --> 26:31.700]  This helmet full of soda is still bubbling.
[26:32.300 --> 26:33.780]  Yeah, that means it's still good.
[26:33.900 --> 26:37.160]  Do you think you could drink that whole head of...
[26:37.160 --> 26:38.300]  You don't drink soda.
[26:38.500 --> 26:38.740]  No.
[26:38.920 --> 26:39.840]  Do you think it'd give you a tummy ache?
[26:40.740 --> 26:42.340]  Yeah, I think my gut would pop.
[26:43.700 --> 26:45.360]  Do you think you could drink it without burping?
[26:46.060 --> 26:46.300]  No.
[26:46.520 --> 26:47.440]  No, we've already learned.
[26:49.120 --> 26:50.380]  Top series two.
[26:50.960 --> 26:52.000]  Let's see what's in this.
[26:53.600 --> 27:11.120]  Leroy Garcia, Dane Dunning, Frambois Valdez, Jordan Walker, Luis Ortiz, Josh Bell, Bryce Johnson, Ricky, we got ourselves an Andres Menez, Luis Castillo, ooh, got the Steve Carlton Aces card, look at that, that's cool.
[27:11.560 --> 27:12.700]  That's nice, I like that.
[27:12.960 --> 27:14.460]  So does that mean there's a whole deck of cards?
[27:14.540 --> 27:16.060]  Geoff McNeil, just Aces for pitchers.
[27:16.200 --> 27:16.580]  Oh, that's cool.
[27:18.280 --> 27:22.120]  Ronny Enriquez, Nolan Arnado, Jace Peterson.
[27:22.780 --> 27:24.620]  Then we might as well open up some Topps Update.
[27:26.280 --> 27:28.160]  I kind of like he was talking to God a little bit.
[27:30.260 --> 27:31.260]  Just that last guy.
[27:31.480 --> 27:32.260]  You know what, I think we should...
[27:32.980 --> 27:36.180]  Oh, yeah, talking to the big man upstairs.
[27:36.440 --> 27:36.980]  Oh, yeah.
[27:37.000 --> 27:37.280]  You wanna see?
[27:38.160 --> 27:40.200]  Please, please, please, please, please, I wanna win.
[27:40.460 --> 27:40.600]  Yeah.
[27:41.080 --> 27:42.120]  For God's sake, let me hit the ball.
[27:42.540 --> 27:42.880]  Please.
[27:43.520 --> 27:52.740]  David Peralta, Jose Siri, James Caprillion, Kinsley Jansen, or Kinley Jansen, he played
[27:52.740 --> 27:53.420]  for the Dodgers.
[27:54.080 --> 27:58.560]  Nick Martinez, Adley Rutschman, we'll just leave that, that's nice.
[27:58.940 --> 28:03.900]  Ooh, we have a Randy Rosarino Major League Material Relic card.
[28:03.980 --> 28:05.200]  Ooh, who's he?
[28:05.680 --> 28:06.300]  Randy Rosarino?
[28:06.380 --> 28:09.160]  He was Rookie of the Year two years ago, three years ago?
[28:09.380 --> 28:09.760]  Nice.
[28:10.200 --> 28:11.560]  Plays for the Devil Rays?
[28:12.020 --> 28:12.440]  I like that.
[28:12.440 --> 28:15.240]  I like that jersey that that guy underneath is wearing.
[28:15.260 --> 28:15.740]  Braden Bistro.
[28:16.440 --> 28:17.860]  Is that like Miami or something?
[28:18.640 --> 28:19.300]  Under here, sorry.
[28:20.380 --> 28:21.280]  That's San Diego.
[28:21.520 --> 28:23.140]  I'm gonna put my eyeballs in bean hole dirt.
[28:23.380 --> 28:24.740]  Stuart Fairchild and...
[28:24.740 --> 28:25.240]  And sleeping.
[28:25.980 --> 28:26.780]  Jason DeLay.
[28:27.220 --> 28:28.300]  How many pens we got?
[28:28.880 --> 28:29.800]  A lot, a thousand?
[28:30.100 --> 28:30.740]  Two thousand, I think.
[28:30.760 --> 28:31.700]  No, how many have we done, though?
[28:31.860 --> 28:32.900]  Oh, man, I don't...
[28:32.900 --> 28:33.640]  Now I have to count?
[28:35.160 --> 28:37.900]  That's a 1994 Top Stadium Club baseball.
[28:38.080 --> 28:39.440]  I've never opened these in my life.
[28:39.560 --> 28:40.100]  Let's see what...
[28:40.100 --> 28:41.460]  I wanna see our 30-minute pace.
[28:41.460 --> 28:52.080]  Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.
[28:56.620 --> 28:57.060]  29.
[28:57.480 --> 28:58.620]  So probably 30 and 30.
[28:58.720 --> 28:59.440]  48 an hour?
[28:59.660 --> 29:01.080]  Tom or Bonnie, rookie.
[29:01.400 --> 29:02.600]  But I'm also...
[29:02.600 --> 29:03.040]  Craigslist.
[29:03.040 --> 29:04.400]  That's one of the worst maths ever.
[29:09.880 --> 29:11.020]  That's one a minute.
[29:11.620 --> 29:13.680]  Yeah, we're fucking crushing it.
[29:13.820 --> 29:14.920]  But there's two of you doing it, right?
[29:15.200 --> 29:17.160]  So how many hours is a thousand minutes?
[29:17.160 --> 29:17.740]  Richie Lewis.
[29:18.940 --> 29:20.140]  How many hours...
[29:20.140 --> 29:21.040]  Carlos Contana.
[29:21.800 --> 29:22.960]  Is it 30 minutes?
[29:23.420 --> 29:23.620]  What?
[29:24.200 --> 29:27.900]  I have so many different things happening and this is chaos over here.
[29:28.700 --> 29:29.700]  Andy Ashby.
[29:29.720 --> 29:30.820]  We'll do a thousand divided by 60, right?
[29:31.380 --> 29:33.300]  A thousand divided by 60, what's that?
[29:33.300 --> 29:34.600]  How many times does six go into a hundred?
[29:34.800 --> 29:35.320]  I don't know.
[29:35.440 --> 29:37.160]  How many times does 60 go into a hundred?
[29:37.480 --> 29:37.940]  Once.
[29:38.180 --> 29:38.340]  Okay.
[29:38.960 --> 29:39.580]  John Peterson.
[29:40.100 --> 29:41.740]  And then some extras left over.
[29:41.900 --> 29:42.460]  Yeah, there you go. You're good.
[29:43.180 --> 29:43.800]  Jean Harris.
[29:43.960 --> 29:44.720]  So you gotta figure it out.
[29:45.780 --> 29:47.020]  She can do six of these an hour.
[29:47.180 --> 29:47.780]  Six pins an hour.
[29:47.880 --> 29:48.380]  Is that where we're at?
[29:48.680 --> 29:48.860]  What?
[29:49.420 --> 29:50.640]  Six pins every thousand minutes.
[29:51.220 --> 29:55.900]  I think if I like had not like a lot happening at once...
[29:57.340 --> 29:58.360]  You know, I've got like...
[29:58.360 --> 29:59.900]  This guy's getting joke harder.
[30:01.880 --> 30:03.080]  John Franco and a gurple.
[30:03.640 --> 30:04.320]  Oh, another pube?
[30:05.500 --> 30:06.940]  That's thin. That's probably not a pube, though.
[30:07.960 --> 30:08.300]  1992.
[30:08.300 --> 30:09.360]  We're baseball.
[30:09.440 --> 30:11.420]  It could be like animal hair.
[30:12.300 --> 30:14.180]  Oh, oh, maybe one of our dead dogs.
[30:15.340 --> 30:17.080]  You could have a piece of Henry.
[30:17.080 --> 30:17.600]  We didn't dig anywhere near that.
[30:17.760 --> 30:18.160]  Dead Henry.
[30:18.340 --> 30:19.680]  No, Henry's not buried.
[30:19.840 --> 30:22.240]  Henry is cremated and he's in a little box in my closet
[30:22.240 --> 30:24.140]  because that's where he would hang out whenever I wasn't home.
[30:24.240 --> 30:26.380]  That's much better than potentially in the dig zone.
[30:26.380 --> 30:27.160]  Yeah, we didn't dig him up.
[30:27.200 --> 30:30.060]  But we do have like possums in the backyard and bunnies.
[30:30.080 --> 30:30.280]  Buried?
[30:30.400 --> 30:31.260]  Lloyd McClendon.
[30:31.340 --> 30:33.580]  I mean, maybe on their natural.
[30:33.860 --> 30:34.680]  We'll save that.
[30:35.100 --> 30:35.840]  Ted Power.
[30:36.080 --> 30:36.880]  John Orton.
[30:37.060 --> 30:37.760]  Mike Bottiker.
[30:37.760 --> 30:38.980]  Ruben Sierra.
[30:39.200 --> 30:39.640]  What's 17?
[30:39.820 --> 30:40.120]  Sean Hillegas.
[30:40.240 --> 30:42.620]  We've only sold 17 of those fucking...
[30:42.620 --> 30:43.180]  Are you serious?
[30:43.340 --> 30:43.560]  No.
[30:43.860 --> 30:44.580]  I can't remember them.
[30:44.940 --> 30:46.220]  Does nobody want the hat?
[30:46.340 --> 30:46.780]  I love the hat.
[30:46.780 --> 30:47.220]  It's girl math.
[30:47.420 --> 30:47.760]  17.
[30:48.360 --> 30:50.440]  One per minute, 16 hours, 40 minutes.
[30:50.820 --> 30:51.580]  Oh, 17 hours.
[30:51.740 --> 30:52.980]  Andres Galarraga, the big cat.
[30:53.280 --> 30:54.560]  Tom Glavine, league leader.
[30:55.020 --> 30:56.140]  Wayne Kirby, prospects.
[30:56.640 --> 30:57.440]  Mark Leiter.
[30:57.740 --> 30:58.920]  Frank Viola.
[31:00.000 --> 31:01.320]  I hope the person getting this...
[31:01.320 --> 31:01.960]  Paul Gibson.
[31:02.360 --> 31:03.600]  Penn likes...
[31:03.600 --> 31:04.300]  Kevin Elster.
[31:04.500 --> 31:05.760]  Georgia and Mike Gavin.
[31:05.780 --> 31:07.460]  Oh, this one's getting Georgia and Mike Gavin.
[31:10.410 --> 31:10.930]  Chris Lumps.
[31:11.010 --> 31:13.830]  All right, you know what I've been thinking about with these collections we're doing,
[31:14.130 --> 31:15.010]  like sup guys and stuff?
[31:15.110 --> 31:17.530]  I think whenever we get like a full sleeve, like nine cards.
[31:17.650 --> 31:17.830]  Yeah.
[31:17.950 --> 31:19.030]  Trying to figure out how to...
[31:19.030 --> 31:19.870]  what to do about them.
[31:19.910 --> 31:20.970]  I think we should give them away.
[31:21.110 --> 31:22.570]  I think we just throw them into random orders.
[31:22.750 --> 31:23.030]  Okay.
[31:23.030 --> 31:26.530]  Like, I don't know when we'll get there, but like every once in a while when we fill one,
[31:26.630 --> 31:30.010]  I'll just have them throw it in and like, oh, I bought a t-shirt and then I got the...
[31:30.010 --> 31:30.290]  Yeah.
[31:30.870 --> 31:32.750]  The fucking guys that look like accountants.
[31:32.870 --> 31:37.790]  I feel like that stuff does well when it's things that we are actually touching.
[31:37.790 --> 31:38.930]  Baba Heda.
[31:39.170 --> 31:40.190]  So what's something else?
[31:40.510 --> 31:43.930]  Grant Lee, Tony Fernandez, Kent Herbeck, Carlton Fisk.
[31:44.930 --> 31:46.630]  Man, it's weird to open these cards specifically.
[31:46.850 --> 31:49.590]  These are... I have such an intense memory of opening these as a kid.
[31:49.670 --> 31:53.030]  Jimmy Key, Kirby Puckett, George, Brett, MVP, Kirby Puckett.
[31:53.030 --> 31:54.290]  Those are some... those glasses.
[31:54.430 --> 31:54.730]  I need that.
[31:55.070 --> 31:56.590]  That's coming... that's going in a pan.
[31:57.170 --> 32:00.110]  Ron Darling, Andre Dawson and Rick Mahler.
[32:01.390 --> 32:02.190]  That's cool.
[32:02.510 --> 32:04.950]  This little thing on the end is for phones, huh?
[32:06.170 --> 32:06.590]  Oh, is it?
[32:06.730 --> 32:06.910]  Yeah.
[32:07.010 --> 32:07.610]  It looks like it.
[32:07.610 --> 32:12.030]  So you can even use it as a little stylus on your iPad.
[32:12.390 --> 32:14.010]  I like this green Christmas shirt.
[32:16.090 --> 32:17.670]  You look really nice in it.
[32:19.810 --> 32:20.790]  Let's open up some...
[32:20.790 --> 32:22.370]  My addition was the snowflake.
[32:22.430 --> 32:23.090]  Alan and Ginter.
[32:24.230 --> 32:25.230]  The little tab.
[32:25.890 --> 32:26.410]  On his tongue.
[32:26.750 --> 32:29.250]  Oh, Gavin, I have something special that I've been holding on to for a long time to open up.
[32:29.370 --> 32:29.630]  Oh, you're here.
[32:30.390 --> 32:31.950]  I've opened up a little bit of it, but not a lot.
[32:32.050 --> 32:32.750]  We'll open it up next.
[32:33.230 --> 32:34.970]  After we open up some Alan and Ginter.
[32:37.610 --> 32:38.320]  Shit, we have a...
[32:39.150 --> 32:40.130]  We're still looking for the Falcon.
[32:40.230 --> 32:41.030]  Josh Bell.
[32:41.250 --> 32:41.830]  These are...
[32:41.830 --> 32:42.470]  And a Ripper.
[32:42.850 --> 32:43.230]  2023.
[32:43.410 --> 32:43.870]  These are new ones.
[32:45.290 --> 32:46.050]  Jorge Mateo.
[32:46.350 --> 32:47.770]  Wade Boggs.
[32:47.950 --> 32:49.690]  Oh, that's a name that you've said.
[32:49.750 --> 32:50.590]  Zach Wheeler.
[32:51.550 --> 32:52.230]  Blake Snell.
[32:52.250 --> 32:53.050]  That's a name I recognize.
[32:53.190 --> 32:54.350]  Look at this.
[32:54.410 --> 32:57.050]  I've never pulled this parallel in my life.
[32:57.710 --> 32:58.470]  Tony Gwynn.
[32:59.310 --> 33:00.810]  I'm not sure what the parallel is called.
[33:00.910 --> 33:01.530]  I'll have to look it up.
[33:01.590 --> 33:02.150]  But look at that.
[33:02.210 --> 33:02.450]  Isn't that nice?
[33:02.470 --> 33:03.670]  They never have, like, shimmers.
[33:04.070 --> 33:04.810]  Yeah, it's...
[33:04.810 --> 33:06.110]  I've never seen one of these in person.
[33:06.210 --> 33:06.570]  That's cool.
[33:08.290 --> 33:09.170]  Sleeve that, please.
[33:09.350 --> 33:10.030]  It's the sleeve pile.
[33:10.250 --> 33:10.950]  Oh, look!
[33:11.190 --> 33:11.830]  We got a lute!
[33:12.590 --> 33:13.330]  Music to our ears.
[33:13.410 --> 33:14.210]  We can add it to the collection.
[33:14.970 --> 33:15.610]  And then...
[33:15.610 --> 33:17.010]  Oh, we got the Taj Mahal.
[33:17.310 --> 33:17.830]  Oh, that's cool.
[33:18.030 --> 33:18.190]  Dang.
[33:18.610 --> 33:19.230]  Just want that.
[33:19.770 --> 33:20.890]  Have you ever been to the Taj Mahal?
[33:21.350 --> 33:21.710]  Have I?
[33:22.030 --> 33:22.790]  I've never been to India.
[33:22.910 --> 33:23.650]  Gavin, you've been to India.
[33:23.710 --> 33:24.390]  Have you ever been to the Taj Mahal?
[33:24.710 --> 33:25.610]  No, didn't go there.
[33:26.170 --> 33:26.970]  But you've been to India?
[33:27.210 --> 33:27.650]  Went to India.
[33:27.870 --> 33:28.350]  What's it like?
[33:29.270 --> 33:29.910]  Oh, it's cool.
[33:30.050 --> 33:30.330]  It's hot.
[33:30.990 --> 33:32.730]  We're watching Amazing Race and they were there right now.
[33:33.250 --> 33:34.690]  The roads are crazy.
[33:35.370 --> 33:35.650]  Francesca...
[33:35.650 --> 33:37.430]  Like, they just, like, go in all different directions?
[33:37.430 --> 33:38.050]  Yeah, it's wherever.
[33:38.090 --> 33:38.510]  J Balvin.
[33:38.510 --> 33:39.770]  Feels like old times.
[33:40.010 --> 33:41.030]  Justin Berlinger.
[33:41.430 --> 33:42.690]  Ryan Mountcastle.
[33:42.870 --> 33:43.650]  Jorge Posada.
[33:45.970 --> 33:47.010]  Alejandro Kirk.
[33:47.750 --> 33:49.230]  And then, uh, Pujol.
[33:49.410 --> 33:49.950]  Okay, that's cool.
[33:50.990 --> 33:52.990]  Lots of dry cities there.
[33:53.670 --> 33:54.570]  Dry cities?
[33:54.930 --> 33:55.650]  Yeah, there's no booze.
[33:55.890 --> 33:56.190]  Oh.
[33:56.410 --> 33:57.390]  Oh, that's what you mean by dry.
[33:57.770 --> 33:57.990]  Yeah.
[33:58.190 --> 33:59.250]  It's like a religious thing?
[33:59.590 --> 33:59.850]  Yeah.
[34:00.170 --> 34:00.710]  That's cool.
[34:02.630 --> 34:05.990]  Ooh, let's open up 12 Americana Historic Trading Carts.
[34:06.630 --> 34:07.710]  See what's up with that.
[34:13.140 --> 34:14.560]  Do you guys remember...
[34:14.560 --> 34:15.060]  I think I can work in a factory.
[34:15.880 --> 34:16.180]  Yeah.
[34:16.700 --> 34:18.620]  Supreme Court Justice David Souter?
[34:19.040 --> 34:19.420]  No.
[34:19.660 --> 34:20.080]  We gotta do it hard.
[34:20.080 --> 34:22.500]  Oh, that's... do we have a great hairline pile?
[34:23.420 --> 34:23.940]  Ooh.
[34:24.400 --> 34:25.660]  We should do now, yeah.
[34:27.380 --> 34:28.220]  The Challenger?
[34:28.640 --> 34:29.460]  That went well.
[34:29.480 --> 34:30.240]  That's sad.
[34:30.460 --> 34:31.360]  Al Capone.
[34:31.660 --> 34:32.000]  Aye.
[34:32.440 --> 34:34.280]  Speaking of judges, Sandra Day O'Connor.
[34:34.460 --> 34:37.440]  She does the... if you ever get called for a jury duty,
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.420]  the video that they show you, which is basically like a DVD of where it's like,
[34:41.640 --> 34:42.400]  jury duty.
[34:42.840 --> 34:44.380]  It's her hosting it.
[34:44.440 --> 34:46.220]  And I'm like, what year is this from?
[34:46.640 --> 34:47.920]  Do you guys remember when we crossed the Delaware?
[34:48.440 --> 34:49.200]  Fuck your country.
[34:51.480 --> 34:53.620]  Everybody's favorite Samuel Gompers.
[34:53.980 --> 34:55.020]  Oh, Gompers.
[34:55.400 --> 34:56.280]  The old Gomp.
[34:56.520 --> 34:57.240]  He's a labor leader.
[34:57.600 --> 34:57.960]  Aye.
[34:58.320 --> 34:58.960]  Bill Bradley.
[34:59.400 --> 35:02.480]  Now he does American Voices with Bill Bradley.
[35:03.220 --> 35:04.440]  Uh, David.
[35:04.580 --> 35:08.180]  He does like, uh, like human interest, like radio shows now.
[35:08.420 --> 35:09.620]  Like, uh, I don't know.
[35:10.040 --> 35:11.140]  Kind of like what Dan Rather does now.
[35:11.560 --> 35:12.320]  Dave Farragut.
[35:13.200 --> 35:14.500]  Rutherford B. Hayes.
[35:14.760 --> 35:15.920]  Ooh, Charles Lindbergh.
[35:15.980 --> 35:16.980]  Wasn't he secretly a Nazi?
[35:17.200 --> 35:18.240]  Didn't he lose his baby?
[35:19.100 --> 35:20.220]  Yeah, I think they found it though.
[35:20.360 --> 35:21.000]  I think that went out well.
[35:21.020 --> 35:22.920]  But I don't think they found it okay, right?
[35:23.180 --> 35:23.340]  No.
[35:23.780 --> 35:24.900]  What do you mean lost his baby?
[35:25.120 --> 35:25.720]  The Lindbergh baby.
[35:25.780 --> 35:26.840]  Was it taken from him?
[35:27.000 --> 35:28.060]  Yeah, got kidnapped, right?
[35:28.220 --> 35:28.640]  Oh, yeah.
[35:28.980 --> 35:30.320]  Uh, and then Andrew Jackson.
[35:30.540 --> 35:31.820]  Wasn't he like, uh, wasn't...
[35:31.820 --> 35:32.860]  Andrew Jackson a piece of shit?
[35:33.500 --> 35:34.100]  Yeah, of course.
[35:34.220 --> 35:35.300]  But wasn't Lindbergh, like, a Nazi?
[35:36.060 --> 35:38.380]  I think he was, like, a really...
[35:38.380 --> 35:39.800]  Oh, guess not.
[35:40.600 --> 35:40.760]  Okay.
[35:42.680 --> 35:44.100]  Nazi confirmation voice.
[35:44.320 --> 35:45.400]  Gavin, I have for you.
[35:45.460 --> 35:46.560]  I've only opened up a few of these.
[35:46.740 --> 35:47.720]  Oh, a Jackass thing?
[35:47.880 --> 35:49.000]  Official Jackass cards.
[35:49.000 --> 35:54.240]  Last time we opened these, the view count when we showed the Godzilla dick went down dramatically.
[35:54.260 --> 35:55.640]  We lost 300 viewers.
[35:55.880 --> 35:56.160]  What do you mean?
[35:56.560 --> 35:58.520]  And there was a picture of Pontius's Godzilla dick.
[35:58.680 --> 35:59.320]  And everyone left?
[35:59.380 --> 36:00.240]  People tuned out, yeah.
[36:00.540 --> 36:01.800]  Was everyone watching it work?
[36:03.780 --> 36:04.600]  They're like, ugh.
[36:04.700 --> 36:05.660]  Or they just don't like Pontius.
[36:05.700 --> 36:06.380]  I want a Steve-O.
[36:06.480 --> 36:07.900]  We're gonna open up all three of these, though.
[36:08.300 --> 36:08.960]  Let's see what we get.
[36:08.980 --> 36:10.800]  Because I think we should have an autograph card in here.
[36:11.520 --> 36:11.840]  Potentially.
[36:12.820 --> 36:13.480]  Oh, that's exciting.
[36:13.500 --> 36:14.020]  And I've been waiting...
[36:14.020 --> 36:14.460]  I've had these...
[36:14.460 --> 36:16.160]  I've had these cards for, like, two years.
[36:16.280 --> 36:17.480]  Just waiting to open them with you.
[36:17.980 --> 36:18.800]  The Bed of Nails.
[36:19.500 --> 36:20.140]  Oh, hell yeah.
[36:20.260 --> 36:20.820]  Oh, that's in India.
[36:22.020 --> 36:23.560]  Uh, here we have Behind the Lens.
[36:24.780 --> 36:26.080]  I don't remember that specific moment.
[36:26.700 --> 36:28.540]  Ooh, the Cup Test Pogo.
[36:28.540 --> 36:32.560]  Oh, that one was so bad.
[36:32.800 --> 36:34.400]  I can't believe you didn't lose a bollock.
[36:34.600 --> 36:37.040]  Here's a numbered, numbered nine out of a hundred.
[36:37.300 --> 36:38.480]  Hi, I'm Tyler, the Creator.
[36:38.960 --> 36:40.220]  Dr. Rolls, we gotta just play that.
[36:40.400 --> 36:40.800]  Let's do that.
[36:47.950 --> 36:48.350]  What?
[36:48.850 --> 36:50.370]  It was the funniest thing I've ever seen.
[36:50.730 --> 36:51.130]  Whoa.
[36:51.270 --> 36:52.070]  Flight of the Icarus.
[36:55.150 --> 36:56.650]  That's a great still.
[36:56.650 --> 36:58.170]  It's so fucking high in the air.
[36:58.530 --> 37:00.050]  You gotta put that in one of the Beedle pens.
[37:00.050 --> 37:01.190]  Somebody deserves that.
[37:01.350 --> 37:04.770]  I feel like that's a great one, because you could tell that that was, like,
[37:05.510 --> 37:09.790]  the exact image Knoxville had in his brain, and then he fulfilled it.
[37:11.650 --> 37:12.830]  This one's gonna be the best.
[37:12.930 --> 37:15.650]  I get the Icarus, the Garpler, and then the Alf wanting you.
[37:16.150 --> 37:17.450]  Goddamn, here's the helicopter.
[37:17.850 --> 37:18.470]  I don't even...
[37:18.470 --> 37:20.450]  Oh, there's more Pontius Dick.
[37:20.790 --> 37:21.230]  Oh, let's see.
[37:21.550 --> 37:22.550]  I'm gonna put it like that.
[37:24.270 --> 37:25.950]  I'm gonna put one of the little pens over it.
[37:26.010 --> 37:26.430]  There you go.
[37:27.150 --> 37:28.490]  That's not... is that even his dick?
[37:28.590 --> 37:29.150]  Yeah, it's right there.
[37:29.150 --> 37:29.550]  Oh.
[37:31.810 --> 37:34.260]  Here we have, behind the lens, there's...
[37:34.750 --> 37:35.330]  Oh, Dave.
[37:35.410 --> 37:36.870]  Dave England sitting on a toilet.
[37:37.030 --> 37:37.850]  Oh, wasn't that when he, like...
[37:37.850 --> 37:38.570]  He's a prolific shitter.
[37:38.710 --> 37:40.310]  ...tried to poop at the garage sale or something?
[37:40.310 --> 37:42.990]  Ooh, this is fucking gross to me.
[37:43.110 --> 37:43.950]  Anaconda ball pit.
[37:44.310 --> 37:47.210]  Blue refractor, I guess, or prism.
[37:47.810 --> 37:49.070]  Here we have a numbered...
[37:49.070 --> 37:51.790]  Hi, I'm Sean Cliver, 40 of 100.
[37:52.090 --> 37:52.750]  He's a legend.
[37:53.270 --> 37:54.630]  I'll be honest, I don't know who he is.
[37:54.810 --> 37:55.570]  Is he a skateboarder?
[37:55.970 --> 37:57.510]  A longtime skateboard artist.
[37:57.910 --> 37:58.110]  Oh.
[37:58.110 --> 38:01.530]  Oh, he's one of the original, uh, Big Brother Magazine staff members.
[38:01.690 --> 38:03.270]  I just can't say he's one of those guys back in the old days.
[38:03.530 --> 38:05.310]  And then, slimed by the Pawnosaurus.
[38:06.210 --> 38:08.510]  Oh, that was, uh, part of where the...
[38:08.510 --> 38:09.150]  That was...
[38:09.150 --> 38:09.870]  That's where the dick...
[38:09.870 --> 38:10.250]  More dick.
[38:10.390 --> 38:10.630]  Dick.
[38:10.630 --> 38:11.250]  Yeah, a lot of dick.
[38:12.950 --> 38:15.090]  Oh, people are so scared of dicks.
[38:15.710 --> 38:17.050]  Pin the tail on the donkey.
[38:17.290 --> 38:18.750]  I mean, you gotta be in the mood to see one.
[38:18.950 --> 38:19.270]  That's true.
[38:20.250 --> 38:21.030]  They are gross.
[38:22.070 --> 38:22.990]  Behind the lens...
[38:24.390 --> 38:24.750]  Oh.
[38:25.110 --> 38:26.430]  Jackass 2 movie poster.
[38:28.110 --> 38:29.110]  Hi, I'm Poopies.
[38:29.250 --> 38:29.630]  There's a Poopies card.
[38:29.630 --> 38:30.590]  Didn't that rocket just...
[38:30.590 --> 38:31.310]  Poopies rookie card.
[38:31.530 --> 38:32.510]  ...explode on the stand?
[38:32.730 --> 38:33.590]  Yes, I think so.
[38:33.710 --> 38:35.010]  I don't think it ever went that high, did it?
[38:35.010 --> 38:36.350]  Almost, like, blew...
[38:36.350 --> 38:37.570]  Musical chair bags.
[38:37.690 --> 38:38.190]  That was awesome.
[38:38.210 --> 38:39.030]  That was a funny skit, too.
[38:39.230 --> 38:39.770]  So that's...
[38:39.770 --> 38:40.310]  That's it.
[38:40.470 --> 38:41.550]  That's the rest of our...
[38:41.550 --> 38:43.490]  Wee man flew over the back and landed on the...
[38:43.490 --> 38:45.110]  That's everything from the Jackass cards?
[38:45.170 --> 38:47.770]  I think that there's one more pack in the pack sack.
[38:47.770 --> 38:48.810]  There was no Stevo in there.
[38:49.570 --> 38:52.450]  Maybe that's what's in the pack sack that we'll find out at Extra Life this weekend.
[38:52.450 --> 38:52.910]  Yeah, maybe.
[38:54.030 --> 38:54.490]  That is true.
[38:54.530 --> 38:55.690]  We will probably open that up in...
[38:56.410 --> 38:56.830]  this weekend.
[38:57.230 --> 39:00.250]  You know what? I should add some packs to the pack sack, just to be fair.
[39:00.370 --> 39:00.990]  I'll put these in.
[39:01.990 --> 39:03.610]  And then, what else we got here?
[39:05.610 --> 39:06.510]  Well, you know what?
[39:06.570 --> 39:08.270]  We were talking about this last week,
[39:08.310 --> 39:12.030]  about the difference between a hobby box and a first-off-the-line box.
[39:12.110 --> 39:15.670]  So maybe we should open up some of these new Flux cards.
[39:15.790 --> 39:17.650]  Let's open up the first-off-the-line box.
[39:17.930 --> 39:18.350]  What do you...
[39:20.030 --> 39:21.330]  Is this a good...
[39:21.330 --> 39:23.090]  This Daryl Strawberry card's good, huh?
[39:23.770 --> 39:24.010]  No.
[39:24.230 --> 39:24.770]  No, okay.
[39:25.370 --> 39:27.450]  I mean, he's a good player, but it's not worth anything.
[39:28.410 --> 39:29.690]  It's a great card to give somebody.
[39:29.910 --> 39:30.230]  Okay.
[39:30.990 --> 39:32.950]  So this first-off-the-line box, Gavin.
[39:33.490 --> 39:33.610]  Yeah.
[39:33.750 --> 39:34.390]  The difference between these...
[39:34.390 --> 39:36.890]  These are both hobby boxes, so you gotta go to a hobby store to buy these, right?
[39:37.150 --> 39:39.990]  This one, like, 250 bucks.
[39:40.370 --> 39:43.890]  This one costs 350 bucks, purely because it's the first-off-the-line,
[39:43.950 --> 39:46.610]  and it has one additional parallel in it.
[39:46.770 --> 39:50.190]  You basically pay an extra $100 to hopefully get one better card.
[39:50.190 --> 39:50.450]  Holy shit.
[39:50.650 --> 39:50.850]  Yeah.
[39:51.030 --> 39:53.530]  And is that what most people go for, or most people want the cheaper box?
[39:53.530 --> 39:55.570]  Most people don't get first-off-the-line.
[39:55.850 --> 39:57.410]  It's... it's pretty expensive.
[39:58.810 --> 39:59.890]  But let's see.
[40:00.030 --> 40:02.090]  Aya Dasamo, Cameron Payne.
[40:02.130 --> 40:03.010]  These just came out.
[40:03.630 --> 40:05.090]  Oh, well, there you go.
[40:05.250 --> 40:05.850]  That's not bad.
[40:05.950 --> 40:07.790]  I got a Walker Kessler auto for my first...
[40:08.630 --> 40:09.350]  out of my first pack.
[40:09.470 --> 40:11.890]  That's a second-year card probably.
[40:12.050 --> 40:12.510]  Another rookie.
[40:13.010 --> 40:13.790]  Rudy Gobert.
[40:14.590 --> 40:15.950]  He's gave COVID to everyone, right?
[40:16.110 --> 40:17.770]  Yeah, he's the one... he was patient zero in the NBA.
[40:18.250 --> 40:20.590]  And then Luca, Flowmotion.
[40:21.290 --> 40:21.790]  That's cool.
[40:21.790 --> 40:23.310]  We've got some more of these bad boys.
[40:23.450 --> 40:24.930]  He plays with Tyree now.
[40:25.550 --> 40:26.190]  Is he in the Flomo?
[40:26.310 --> 40:27.030]  And Grant Williams.
[40:28.650 --> 40:29.830]  He's a Flomo guy, yeah.
[40:30.770 --> 40:33.490]  Aaron Neesmith, bitter about being traded from the Celtics.
[40:34.530 --> 40:35.330]  Isaac Okoro.
[40:37.370 --> 40:38.430]  Jalen Williams rookie.
[40:38.730 --> 40:41.250]  I can't remember if that's J-Will or J-Dub, they're both the same name.
[40:41.550 --> 40:42.230]  Moses Moody.
[40:42.330 --> 40:45.630]  That looks like a Prism, it is.
[40:45.750 --> 40:46.610]  Oh my god, there's two under here.
[40:46.610 --> 40:47.670]  Oh, Triumph!
[40:47.770 --> 40:49.950]  Jalen Brown insert.
[40:50.090 --> 40:50.710]  That's cool.
[40:51.430 --> 40:52.070]  Love that.
[40:52.330 --> 40:52.490]  Celtics.
[40:52.870 --> 40:55.110]  Cool thing about the Celtics, Boston Celtics, if you're paying attention,
[40:55.250 --> 40:57.070]  is that they're going to win the NBA championship this year.
[40:57.170 --> 40:57.370]  Yeah.
[40:57.490 --> 40:58.450]  It's pretty much already given.
[40:58.630 --> 41:01.290]  You called it, you were the first one to say it.
[41:01.330 --> 41:04.410]  You called it, like, at tip-off of their first game.
[41:04.470 --> 41:04.630]  Yeah.
[41:04.890 --> 41:05.870]  You said they're going to win.
[41:06.290 --> 41:07.010]  Zach Levine.
[41:07.710 --> 41:10.490]  What do you think the chances are Zach Levine still plays for the Bulls by the end of the year?
[41:10.590 --> 41:11.510]  I'd say 50-50.
[41:12.050 --> 41:13.150]  Oh, Jason Tatum.
[41:13.690 --> 41:14.050]  He's good.
[41:14.110 --> 41:15.990]  He plays for the Celtics that are going to win the championship.
[41:16.230 --> 41:18.410]  Yeah, he's about a future... this season's going to be...
[41:18.410 --> 41:19.030]  This one is...
[41:19.030 --> 41:19.370]  Champion.
[41:19.370 --> 41:20.490]  Is this the last time they won?
[41:20.690 --> 41:20.910]  16?
[41:22.350 --> 41:24.990]  That was when they won... when they'd only won 16.
[41:25.310 --> 41:26.090]  How many do they have now?
[41:26.230 --> 41:26.510]  17.
[41:27.170 --> 41:30.170]  That's before the KG...
[41:30.910 --> 41:31.870]  Oh, that's why he's...
[41:31.870 --> 41:34.350]  Paul Pierce, Anthony Davis, Prism.
[41:34.510 --> 41:34.990]  That's nice.
[41:35.750 --> 41:36.930]  Benedict Matherin rookie.
[41:37.210 --> 41:37.870]  That's pretty.
[41:38.050 --> 41:38.750]  The Titan rookie.
[41:38.950 --> 41:39.830]  I'm just throwing them now.
[41:42.890 --> 41:46.090]  How many... are there still helmets left do we know?
[41:46.750 --> 41:47.910]  I think that there are.
[41:48.010 --> 41:48.590]  They would have told us.
[41:48.590 --> 41:50.210]  I think we'll have helmets left for the next month.
[41:50.290 --> 41:52.290]  Yeah, don't forget to buy a nacho helmet.
[41:52.770 --> 41:54.690]  And an ice cream helmet and a popcorn helmet.
[41:55.090 --> 41:56.610]  Yeah, like there it is right there.
[41:56.970 --> 41:57.490]  A dirt helmet.
[41:57.490 --> 41:58.610]  You can use it for nachos.
[41:58.890 --> 42:04.190]  Or if you're really clever and innovative and forward thinking,
[42:04.690 --> 42:05.810]  you can fill it with soda.
[42:05.990 --> 42:06.950]  It holds a six pack.
[42:07.010 --> 42:07.530]  Oh, drink from it.
[42:07.550 --> 42:08.110]  And if you're thirsty.
[42:09.150 --> 42:09.270]  Yum.
[42:12.850 --> 42:13.850]  That's so refreshing.
[42:14.470 --> 42:15.470]  Not making a dent in that.
[42:17.410 --> 42:19.490]  I think I'm going to drink like sweet coke.
[42:19.550 --> 42:19.950]  Oh, shit.
[42:20.170 --> 42:20.950]  Oh, my God.
[42:20.950 --> 42:21.170]  A good spill?
[42:21.170 --> 42:22.310]  I don't know what she did that for.
[42:22.590 --> 42:22.910]  Oops.
[42:23.230 --> 42:23.510]  Oh, God.
[42:24.350 --> 42:25.810]  It is easy to spill.
[42:27.430 --> 42:28.390]  That's terrible.
[42:29.350 --> 42:30.010]  The dirt.
[42:30.930 --> 42:31.670]  My dirt.
[42:33.890 --> 42:35.070]  Hey, Ben Simmons.
[42:36.250 --> 42:37.490]  He doesn't feel good.
[42:37.490 --> 42:37.810]  He's the punchline.
[42:38.330 --> 42:39.130]  Jordan Poole.
[42:39.230 --> 42:40.010]  He's also the punchline.
[42:40.110 --> 42:40.650]  Derek White.
[42:40.850 --> 42:41.370]  Boston Celtic.
[42:41.410 --> 42:41.750]  Thank you.
[42:43.610 --> 42:44.530]  Terrence Mann.
[42:44.530 --> 42:46.130]  Some sort of a...
[42:46.130 --> 42:47.250]  I guess it's just a prism.
[42:47.490 --> 42:47.690]  Yeah.
[42:48.290 --> 42:50.030]  And then John Morant.
[42:50.390 --> 42:50.750]  Fluid.
[42:51.370 --> 42:52.290]  What was John Morant's thing?
[42:52.350 --> 42:52.910]  Oh, he...
[42:52.910 --> 42:53.250]  Guns.
[42:53.350 --> 42:53.930]  His thing's guns.
[42:54.290 --> 42:54.330]  Yeah.
[42:54.650 --> 42:55.530]  That's why...
[42:55.530 --> 42:56.810]  Has Memphis still not won?
[42:57.210 --> 42:58.610]  They won their first game last night.
[42:58.710 --> 42:59.150]  They did?
[42:59.190 --> 43:00.030]  I told you.
[43:00.070 --> 43:02.070]  I told you they were going to win the second pitch...
[43:02.070 --> 43:03.010]  Portland game and they did.
[43:03.410 --> 43:04.030]  Oh, good.
[43:04.310 --> 43:05.630]  Also, in that game...
[43:06.650 --> 43:09.110]  I'm heartbroken to say Rob Williams went out with a knee injury.
[43:09.390 --> 43:10.190]  He plays for Portland now.
[43:10.330 --> 43:11.350]  That's his deal, huh?
[43:11.450 --> 43:11.750]  Yeah.
[43:11.870 --> 43:14.090]  And I don't know how bad it is, but he had to go to the locker room.
[43:14.630 --> 43:16.910]  Hopefully he's okay because I hate to see Rob Williams injured.
[43:17.430 --> 43:18.350]  Cade Cunningham.
[43:18.650 --> 43:19.410]  Jimmy Butler.
[43:20.230 --> 43:21.550]  Mark Williams rookie.
[43:23.410 --> 43:25.450]  Julian Champagny rookie.
[43:27.090 --> 43:27.830]  Paolo Bancaro.
[43:28.230 --> 43:29.170]  Second year card.
[43:29.530 --> 43:31.590]  What would be the best hit you could get off of this?
[43:32.370 --> 43:33.310]  Well, one of one.
[43:34.370 --> 43:35.670]  Paolo Bancaro rookie card.
[43:35.870 --> 43:36.270]  Oh, really?
[43:36.870 --> 43:37.630]  What's his deal?
[43:37.710 --> 43:38.490]  I haven't heard about him.
[43:38.930 --> 43:40.310]  He's the rookie of the year last year.
[43:40.870 --> 43:42.210]  For the Orlando Magic.
[43:42.610 --> 43:43.090]  He's good.
[43:43.750 --> 43:44.970]  Playing well this year so far.
[43:45.150 --> 43:46.010]  Spencer Dinwiddie.
[43:46.370 --> 43:47.710]  Jose Alvarado.
[43:47.970 --> 43:48.750]  Kenyon Martin.
[43:48.870 --> 43:50.090]  Max Christie rookie.
[43:50.330 --> 43:51.190]  Silver promo.
[43:51.530 --> 43:53.290]  Rookie influx is Jalen Dern.
[43:53.470 --> 43:53.630]  Yeah.
[43:54.510 --> 43:56.690]  Or like, you know, any kind of one of one.
[43:56.810 --> 43:58.130]  Steph Curry would be nice.
[43:58.210 --> 43:58.610]  LeBron.
[43:59.410 --> 44:01.130]  Those are always going to be worth a dickload.
[44:02.070 --> 44:04.150]  What's the most wanted card right now?
[44:04.370 --> 44:06.770]  Like, if you were to look on, like, everyone is...
[44:08.310 --> 44:10.810]  I don't know, there's like Mike Trout was a big deal for a long time.
[44:11.410 --> 44:13.230]  Yeah, like, what's the hottest card right now?
[44:13.370 --> 44:13.510]  Yeah.
[44:15.310 --> 44:16.090]  I can tell you.
[44:16.410 --> 44:18.330]  Oh my god, we didn't do our last week's.
[44:18.370 --> 44:18.890]  Oh, we didn't.
[44:18.890 --> 44:19.850]  Oh my god, we didn't even do it.
[44:19.910 --> 44:20.970]  But go through your stuff first.
[44:20.990 --> 44:21.170]  Sorry.
[44:21.370 --> 44:22.630]  Yeah, we'll look them up.
[44:22.770 --> 44:23.530]  Well, that's a good call.
[44:23.590 --> 44:24.210]  Thank you for that.
[44:25.290 --> 44:25.970]  Najee Marshall.
[44:26.630 --> 44:26.970]  DFS.
[44:28.270 --> 44:29.350]  Christian Coloco rookie.
[44:29.630 --> 44:30.630]  These are such pretty cards.
[44:31.650 --> 44:32.770]  Andrew Nembhard rookie.
[44:33.590 --> 44:35.450]  And then Jeremy Sohan.
[44:36.050 --> 44:36.390]  Nice.
[44:36.490 --> 44:37.030]  So-Shan.
[44:37.270 --> 44:38.570]  So-Han, I've heard it pronounced both ways.
[44:39.230 --> 44:41.350]  He's actually playing quite well this year, I think.
[44:42.590 --> 44:46.030]  I've gotta be real careful because I keep grabbing my screws from my screw cup
[44:46.030 --> 44:48.450]  and putting my fingers in my cappuccino.
[44:49.390 --> 44:50.750]  Oh, you have the same?
[44:51.050 --> 44:51.570]  Not ideal.
[44:52.130 --> 44:53.150]  D'Anthony Melton.
[44:53.470 --> 44:54.290]  Josh Richardson.
[44:54.710 --> 44:55.650]  Kevin Herter.
[44:56.190 --> 44:57.350]  Jalen Smith.
[44:57.530 --> 44:57.930]  Prism.
[44:59.110 --> 45:00.010]  Paolo Bencaro rookie.
[45:01.370 --> 45:02.310]  Any high legs today?
[45:03.070 --> 45:04.110]  Not so far.
[45:04.290 --> 45:06.310]  What we're hoping for is whatever this fucking...
[45:06.310 --> 45:08.630]  I need to find what my first off the line
[45:10.830 --> 45:12.890]  parallel is, or insert is, because I haven't seen it yet.
[45:12.990 --> 45:13.670]  Buddy Heald.
[45:13.850 --> 45:14.850]  Sadiq Bae.
[45:15.050 --> 45:16.010]  Jeremy Sohan rookie.
[45:16.450 --> 45:17.650]  What if it's a parallel dill?
[45:18.350 --> 45:19.610]  That'd be fucking amazing.
[45:19.830 --> 45:20.430]  A triple dill?
[45:20.550 --> 45:21.230]  Triple dill, parallel dill.
[45:21.230 --> 45:22.690]  Amy Lillard.
[45:22.870 --> 45:23.730]  Keegan Murray.
[45:24.430 --> 45:25.170]  These guys are pretty.
[45:25.390 --> 45:26.370]  This is the last pack.
[45:26.670 --> 45:28.470]  I like how they're like blue and yellow.
[45:28.470 --> 45:32.610]  So if I don't see it in here, then I'll have to go back...
[45:32.610 --> 45:33.390]  Oh, there it is.
[45:33.890 --> 45:35.250]  Okay, Drew Holliday.
[45:38.910 --> 45:40.470]  Celtic now, but that's not a Celtic card.
[45:40.530 --> 45:41.330]  Robert Williams.
[45:41.570 --> 45:42.390]  Speak of the devil.
[45:42.650 --> 45:43.370]  Silver, parallel.
[45:44.070 --> 45:44.590]  Unfortunately.
[45:45.390 --> 45:46.790]  Timberwolves, Anthony Edwards.
[45:46.890 --> 45:47.430]  Triumph card.
[45:47.490 --> 45:48.150]  That's pretty cool.
[45:48.510 --> 45:49.450]  Jonathan Kuminga.
[45:49.690 --> 45:55.830]  And then the first off the line flux parallel seven, number seven of 17.
[45:56.950 --> 45:57.990]  Luka Doncic.
[45:58.490 --> 46:01.470]  That's gonna be probably a hundred dollar card.
[46:01.790 --> 46:02.710]  Oh, shit.
[46:02.970 --> 46:03.030]  Yeah.
[46:04.130 --> 46:04.670]  Oh, that's cool.
[46:06.030 --> 46:07.350]  That's number 17.
[46:08.170 --> 46:11.070]  That might be a 150 to 200 dollar card.
[46:11.090 --> 46:11.410]  Oh my God, that's so many.
[46:12.490 --> 46:13.350]  This one's empty.
[46:13.890 --> 46:14.850]  Oh, I did an empty one.
[46:16.270 --> 46:16.790]  We'll go ahead and...
[46:16.790 --> 46:17.010]  Shit.
[46:17.250 --> 46:19.090]  I'll just go ahead and take care of sleeving this bad boy.
[46:19.090 --> 46:19.590]  I'm sorry.
[46:19.770 --> 46:20.870]  I've got dirt.
[46:20.870 --> 46:21.570]  That one's for Australia.
[46:21.570 --> 46:22.150]  So there you go.
[46:23.090 --> 46:24.930]  That's what you're paying extra money for.
[46:25.330 --> 46:28.230]  The chance to get a hit like this, which is a pretty fucking big hit, honestly.
[46:28.710 --> 46:28.990]  Yeah.
[46:29.130 --> 46:34.130]  So if you're gonna get a non-rookie card, you can't get much better than LeBron or
[46:34.130 --> 46:35.270]  Curry or Luka.
[46:35.950 --> 46:37.930]  So that was all the extra value in one card.
[46:38.030 --> 46:38.270]  Yeah.
[46:38.410 --> 46:41.590]  Do you think that he'll be like in the Hall of Fame?
[46:41.890 --> 46:42.010]  Luka?
[46:42.350 --> 46:42.610]  Oh, yeah.
[46:42.810 --> 46:43.290]  Yeah, for sure.
[46:43.470 --> 46:43.670]  And then...
[46:45.890 --> 46:47.810]  But he's an all-star, right?
[46:47.850 --> 46:48.050]  Luka?
[46:48.270 --> 46:48.430]  Yeah.
[46:48.930 --> 46:49.570]  All NBA.
[46:50.830 --> 46:54.990]  So do card values go up when they go into the Hall of Fame?
[46:55.150 --> 46:55.410]  Yes.
[46:55.570 --> 46:55.750]  Okay.
[46:56.050 --> 46:56.350]  Yes.
[46:56.450 --> 46:59.970]  When they win a title, when they go into the Hall of Fame, all that kind of stuff.
[47:00.370 --> 47:02.890]  Is it every year certain people go in or is it every night?
[47:02.890 --> 47:07.770]  I think every year they have Hall of Fame inductees or at least they have the opportunity.
[47:08.170 --> 47:10.270]  Is that what Kevin Garnett did or did he just hang his jersey?
[47:11.130 --> 47:12.730]  Yeah, Kevin Garnett's jersey got hung.
[47:12.970 --> 47:14.470]  He was retired by the Celtics.
[47:14.650 --> 47:14.770]  Yeah.
[47:14.970 --> 47:15.150]  Yeah.
[47:16.130 --> 47:17.490]  But that's not Hall of Fame.
[47:18.010 --> 47:19.630]  He will be a Hall of Famer, I'm sure.
[47:20.210 --> 47:22.530]  Kevin Garnett's one of the greatest power forwards of all time.
[47:22.570 --> 47:23.370]  He changed basketball.
[47:25.710 --> 47:26.430]  Let's see.
[47:26.770 --> 47:28.870]  Oh, I was gonna open up something else to show Gavr.
[47:29.930 --> 47:31.110]  See if I can find him.
[47:32.270 --> 47:32.630]  GoldenEye?
[47:32.630 --> 47:34.230]  But I do have...
[47:34.230 --> 47:35.850]  It's been a pretty denchless day so far.
[47:36.630 --> 47:37.750]  I do have this.
[47:38.790 --> 47:40.590]  Bob Ross, the joy of baseball.
[47:40.830 --> 47:44.410]  We opened up some of these last week and I got a really nice King Riffey Jr. parallel.
[47:46.590 --> 47:48.050]  Didn't he used to be a drill sergeant?
[47:48.510 --> 47:49.270]  King Riffey Jr.?
[47:49.270 --> 47:49.510]  No.
[47:50.670 --> 47:51.330]  Bob Ross.
[47:51.430 --> 47:51.610]  Yeah.
[47:52.110 --> 47:52.510]  Yeah.
[47:53.610 --> 47:55.010]  He's stationed in Alaska, I think.
[47:55.170 --> 47:56.510]  And that's when he fell in love with nature.
[47:57.790 --> 47:58.190]  Interesting.
[47:58.670 --> 48:00.370]  So how long did he serve in the military?
[48:00.890 --> 48:02.530]  He might have retired from the military.
[48:02.730 --> 48:03.730]  He was definitely in for a while.
[48:03.990 --> 48:06.310]  So we got a Nolan Gorman rookie.
[48:06.670 --> 48:06.890]  Now these...
[48:07.590 --> 48:08.170]  You know what?
[48:08.230 --> 48:10.330]  Because I need to pull up last week's cards so I can show the thing.
[48:10.910 --> 48:11.350]  I had one of these.
[48:11.430 --> 48:13.590]  I can't find any of these for comps.
[48:14.630 --> 48:17.970]  I was trying to price out last week's one of these in the package.
[48:18.050 --> 48:19.790]  I can't find this card anywhere.
[48:19.890 --> 48:20.630]  So I don't know what they're worth.
[48:22.990 --> 48:24.730]  You're getting really good at this.
[48:25.450 --> 48:26.950]  You're a little dirty boy.
[48:27.170 --> 48:27.830]  Joey Bart?
[48:27.930 --> 48:28.450]  I'm trying to help my average.
[48:29.270 --> 48:31.070]  There's the Nolan Gorman regular card.
[48:31.170 --> 48:35.550]  So you can see that the easel card is different in some way.
[48:35.610 --> 48:36.830]  But I don't know how to...
[48:36.830 --> 48:38.110]  Oh, because it has an easel on it.
[48:38.130 --> 48:42.330]  Yeah, but I can't find any record of them being sold on eBay yet.
[48:42.730 --> 48:44.730]  Miguel Cabrera, Juan Soto.
[48:45.010 --> 48:47.170]  Ooh, number to 75...
[48:47.170 --> 48:49.310]  Or number 64, 75, Boba Shett.
[48:49.790 --> 48:51.290]  That's the numbered parallel for this.
[48:51.450 --> 48:51.910]  From Star Wars?
[48:52.250 --> 48:53.850]  Yeah, Boba Shett from Star Wars.
[48:54.290 --> 48:54.970]  Hank Aaron.
[48:55.290 --> 48:55.990]  That's cool.
[48:56.750 --> 48:57.630]  Francisco Lindor.
[48:57.630 --> 48:59.030]  Anthony Volpe rookie.
[48:59.170 --> 49:00.590]  Ryan Mountcastle.
[49:00.830 --> 49:02.170]  Vaughn Grisham rookie.
[49:02.390 --> 49:04.130]  Oswaldo Pereza rookie.
[49:04.570 --> 49:05.830]  And then Mark Vientos rookie.
[49:05.910 --> 49:08.070]  Those are still continue to be such nice cards.
[49:08.250 --> 49:09.350]  They're also very hard to find.
[49:09.850 --> 49:10.430]  Very hard to get.
[49:10.470 --> 49:11.290]  And that's all that came in.
[49:11.410 --> 49:12.610]  It's just like seven left.
[49:12.610 --> 49:14.890]  Yeah, and I have one more box in there somewhere.
[49:15.250 --> 49:21.070]  Okay, let's find last week's so we can run down the values.
[49:21.690 --> 49:23.010]  Thanks for reminding me about that, Emily.
[49:23.010 --> 49:23.570]  I completely forgot.
[49:23.790 --> 49:24.210]  Thank you.
[49:24.210 --> 49:27.890]  Oh, that is disgusting.
[49:31.490 --> 49:33.410]  I think we'll go...
[49:33.410 --> 49:34.050]  Yeah, it starts here.
[49:34.310 --> 49:34.430]  Okay.
[49:36.890 --> 49:41.550]  So if you watched the show last week, you know these were the hits that we had.
[49:41.610 --> 49:43.310]  I went ahead and priced them out.
[49:43.630 --> 49:46.110]  I will show you what they are now worth.
[49:46.970 --> 49:48.710]  Let us see.
[49:50.190 --> 49:51.330]  Where's my card?
[49:52.150 --> 49:52.610]  Volume...
[49:52.610 --> 49:52.950]  Card values.
[49:53.090 --> 49:54.050]  Okay, first one.
[49:54.050 --> 49:55.250]  Mookie Betts SSP.
[49:55.470 --> 49:56.650]  Remember, it's the holiday card.
[49:56.710 --> 49:58.790]  He's got the Christmas lights around his neck.
[49:59.150 --> 49:59.170]  Yeah.
[49:59.410 --> 50:00.490]  That is worth five dollars.
[50:00.650 --> 50:01.570]  Oh, nice.
[50:02.070 --> 50:04.070]  James Altman Rookie Parallel.
[50:04.190 --> 50:04.790]  The Great Parallel.
[50:04.870 --> 50:05.970]  That is worth four dollars.
[50:06.170 --> 50:06.470]  Nice.
[50:07.550 --> 50:09.550]  Brett Beatty Relic Card.
[50:09.650 --> 50:11.350]  That is worth three dollars.
[50:11.490 --> 50:12.190]  Three dollars?
[50:12.670 --> 50:14.030]  And it's a whole piece of his jersey?
[50:14.110 --> 50:14.670]  It's a whole piece of his jersey.
[50:15.070 --> 50:15.830]  Here's one of those...
[50:16.610 --> 50:16.950]  Easels?
[50:17.050 --> 50:17.450]  Easel cards.
[50:17.490 --> 50:17.990]  I have no idea.
[50:18.170 --> 50:18.610]  Couldn't find it.
[50:18.990 --> 50:19.170]  Okay.
[50:20.870 --> 50:23.050]  Miguel Vargas Rookie is five dollars.
[50:23.250 --> 50:23.470]  Okay.
[50:23.470 --> 50:28.490]  This Ken Griffey Jr. numbered to 50 that I got last week is about 60 bucks.
[50:28.710 --> 50:30.750]  Wow, that's one of the Vargas ones, huh?
[50:30.910 --> 50:33.330]  Is that Griffey Jr. stuff pretty valuable?
[50:33.690 --> 50:35.330]  Yeah, he's kind of like...
[50:35.330 --> 50:36.890]  You know LeBron James, right?
[50:37.130 --> 50:37.430]  Yeah.
[50:37.570 --> 50:39.990]  He's like the LeBron James of baseball in terms of just like recognition.
[50:40.350 --> 50:41.930]  Evergreen, like everybody loves him.
[50:41.950 --> 50:42.870]  One of the greatest baseball players.
[50:42.930 --> 50:44.410]  One of the most popular baseball players.
[50:44.850 --> 50:46.410]  One of the most beloved of all time.
[50:47.330 --> 50:48.390]  I don't know why...
[50:48.390 --> 50:51.250]  This Oral Hirschhiser in a PSA 9, I couldn't find a 10.
[50:51.930 --> 50:52.830]  Running about 18 bucks.
[50:55.470 --> 50:57.650]  This Nolan Ryan...
[50:59.150 --> 50:59.810]  Forty dollars.
[51:00.110 --> 51:00.990]  That's pretty good.
[51:01.370 --> 51:05.730]  This Nolan Ryan 5,000 K's card, in perfect condition, run you 50.
[51:06.110 --> 51:06.370]  Wow.
[51:06.550 --> 51:07.830]  These are all things we just got from guesses.
[51:08.050 --> 51:08.870]  These are guesses, yeah.
[51:08.930 --> 51:10.830]  These Bo Jacksons are about 65 bucks each.
[51:11.250 --> 51:11.690]  Dang.
[51:11.810 --> 51:16.850]  And then somebody mentioned this Kirby Puckett error card that might be worth a lot of money.
[51:17.070 --> 51:17.970]  It is the error card.
[51:18.070 --> 51:19.570]  It's got his wrong birthday on the back.
[51:19.830 --> 51:21.890]  It says his birthday is March 14th, 1961.
[51:21.890 --> 51:23.570]  But he was actually born in 1960.
[51:24.510 --> 51:25.450]  I looked him up.
[51:25.850 --> 51:26.510]  They're not worth anything.
[51:26.610 --> 51:29.190]  People are selling them for like $1,500 on eBay.
[51:29.190 --> 51:30.870]  But people are buying them for $1.
[51:31.470 --> 51:32.710]  Is Kirby Puckett...
[51:32.710 --> 51:33.950]  Is he still alive and everything?
[51:34.210 --> 51:35.230]  I believe he's still alive.
[51:35.370 --> 51:38.990]  I assume that after people die, their stuff goes up in value?
[51:39.210 --> 51:39.890]  It tends to.
[51:40.310 --> 51:42.550]  Kirby Puckett is a good baseball player.
[51:42.710 --> 51:43.430]  But he's not a...
[51:44.350 --> 51:44.870]  Is he an all-star?
[51:45.330 --> 51:46.670]  Or like a Hall of Famer?
[51:46.730 --> 51:48.150]  He was absolutely...
[51:48.150 --> 51:49.450]  I don't know if he's in the Hall of Fame or not.
[51:49.650 --> 51:49.930]  But...
[51:49.930 --> 51:51.010]  And then I want to do a little show and tell.
[51:51.250 --> 51:51.430]  Oh.
[51:51.430 --> 51:52.570]  For my personal stuff.
[51:53.070 --> 51:56.550]  So I was very excited to get this card and my own WNBA cards.
[51:56.630 --> 51:58.370]  I got a Brittany Griner Silver Parallel.
[51:58.370 --> 51:58.630]  Nice.
[51:58.630 --> 51:59.350]  I thought that was really nice.
[51:59.450 --> 52:00.270]  I was very excited about that.
[52:00.330 --> 52:00.910]  I like Brittany Griner.
[52:01.230 --> 52:04.770]  And then I just did a So Alright episode about the first high five.
[52:04.870 --> 52:05.290]  Oh, so good.
[52:05.290 --> 52:06.150]  Talking about Dusty Baker.
[52:06.550 --> 52:12.330]  And the other member of the first high five, who was also the first gay baseball player...
[52:12.330 --> 52:14.050]  The first baseball player to come out as gay, Glenn Burke.
[52:14.130 --> 52:15.150]  I bought his rookie card.
[52:15.190 --> 52:16.870]  That story was so good.
[52:16.930 --> 52:20.010]  This is 1977, I want to say.
[52:20.910 --> 52:21.270]  1976.
[52:21.830 --> 52:23.990]  Yeah, this is a 78 card, I believe.
[52:24.230 --> 52:25.250]  But yeah, he was a rookie in 77.
[52:25.430 --> 52:28.430]  So that was when he was playing with...
[52:28.430 --> 52:28.830]  The Dodgers.
[52:28.890 --> 52:30.150]  That was the year he hit the homerun.
[52:30.150 --> 52:30.990]  Would have been 77.
[52:31.430 --> 52:32.950]  That's his card from the homerun.
[52:33.110 --> 52:33.930]  From that year.
[52:34.190 --> 52:34.430]  Yeah.
[52:34.590 --> 52:35.990]  Or the year, the first high five year, yeah.
[52:36.090 --> 52:36.830]  He hit a homerun that game.
[52:36.850 --> 52:39.450]  So if he was half the high five, why does he never get the...
[52:40.130 --> 52:41.050]  Why does he never get remembered?
[52:41.650 --> 52:44.510]  Well, Dusty Baker went on to become a Hall of Fame player.
[52:44.750 --> 52:46.270]  And he coached for 26 years.
[52:46.630 --> 52:47.890]  And stayed on the present.
[52:48.110 --> 52:49.410]  And Glenn Burke was gay.
[52:49.410 --> 52:51.110]  Yeah, but what's more famous?
[52:52.010 --> 52:53.590]  Dusty or the high five?
[52:54.190 --> 52:58.190]  I think most people that I've told, like, that the high five was recently invented,
[52:58.310 --> 52:59.150]  nobody believes.
[52:59.490 --> 53:00.730]  Yeah, nobody accepts that...
[53:01.310 --> 53:02.050]  It didn't exist.
[53:02.210 --> 53:02.910]  It was invented.
[53:03.690 --> 53:06.770]  Everybody just refuses to believe that...
[53:06.770 --> 53:08.330]  Like the handshake was invented.
[53:08.570 --> 53:08.830]  Right.
[53:10.710 --> 53:12.390]  What else should we open up?
[53:12.410 --> 53:13.190]  It just seems so normal.
[53:13.270 --> 53:18.050]  But if I, like, walked over to you and just grabbed your kneecap as if it was normal,
[53:18.210 --> 53:18.810]  it'd be so weird.
[53:19.810 --> 53:21.870]  But there is a world where that could have been the norm.
[53:22.170 --> 53:22.410]  Yeah.
[53:23.590 --> 53:23.950]  Oops.
[53:24.430 --> 53:28.590]  Or maybe it's like how the players will do, like, the jump and, like, hit their hips together,
[53:28.730 --> 53:29.010]  you know?
[53:29.150 --> 53:29.350]  Yeah.
[53:31.190 --> 53:35.830]  Since Gavin's here, let's open up some of these historical edition American comic books.
[53:35.850 --> 53:38.290]  And while we're doing this USA pen stuff.
[53:39.750 --> 53:41.170]  And this USA pen stuff.
[53:42.130 --> 53:43.290]  All right, let's see what we got.
[53:45.470 --> 53:47.230]  Geronimo, Satchel Paige,
[53:48.650 --> 53:50.810]  Willie Sims, Gold Parallel.
[53:50.910 --> 53:52.290]  Ooh, Carl Benz.
[53:52.410 --> 53:53.510]  It's horse racing season.
[53:53.630 --> 53:54.190]  Is Carl Benz...
[53:55.430 --> 53:55.990]  The Benz?
[53:56.130 --> 53:56.350]  The car guy?
[53:56.770 --> 54:02.290]  In 1885, Benz built the world's first automobile powered by practical internal combustion.
[54:02.370 --> 54:03.230]  Is it Mercedes-Benz?
[54:03.570 --> 54:04.070]  Carl Benz.
[54:04.270 --> 54:06.170]  Yeah, but do you think that he's the Benz of Mercedes-Benz?
[54:06.550 --> 54:07.170]  Carl Benz.
[54:08.910 --> 54:10.550]  But he's the Benz of the Mercedes-Benz.
[54:10.730 --> 54:12.550]  I don't know if his name is Carl, not Mercedes.
[54:12.630 --> 54:14.310]  But he is partnered with Mercedes-Benz.
[54:14.570 --> 54:15.790]  He was friends with Terry Jeep.
[54:15.970 --> 54:17.110]  Aaron Burr.
[54:17.810 --> 54:19.490]  Alexander Graham Bell.
[54:19.890 --> 54:21.070]  The phone guy?
[54:21.270 --> 54:21.730]  The phone guy.
[54:22.230 --> 54:23.570]  John L. Sullivan.
[54:24.010 --> 54:24.750]  And then another...
[54:24.750 --> 54:25.050]  The Pence guy?
[54:25.130 --> 54:27.330]  Hey, we got two Satchel Pages if anybody wants to trade.
[54:28.010 --> 54:31.250]  I'm going to put those with the Pence because it's USA only.
[54:31.470 --> 54:31.970]  USA all the way.
[54:32.810 --> 54:34.330]  Ooh, we got an Obama.
[54:35.030 --> 54:36.270]  Why don't you put that in?
[54:36.490 --> 54:37.470]  I will, absolutely.
[54:39.570 --> 54:41.310]  Eisenhower, Aaron Burr.
[54:42.170 --> 54:44.130]  Wait, isn't there... wasn't it Aaron Burr?
[54:44.210 --> 54:45.910]  Oh no, who was it that he shot?
[54:46.290 --> 54:47.110]  Didn't they shoot each other?
[54:48.950 --> 54:49.390]  Hamilton?
[54:49.630 --> 54:50.590]  Hamilton, not Eisenhower.
[54:50.670 --> 54:51.310]  Hamilton and Burr.
[54:51.430 --> 54:52.850]  Remember that commercial with the peanut butter?
[54:53.010 --> 54:53.990]  We'll see if we get a Hamilton.
[54:54.370 --> 54:57.630]  And then a gold foil or a gold refractor Babe Ruth.
[54:57.870 --> 54:58.310]  That's pretty cool.
[55:00.110 --> 55:02.770]  Last pack of our American History cards.
[55:04.470 --> 55:08.890]  Someone said the handshake was a warrior wrist grab initially in the chat.
[55:09.670 --> 55:10.390]  Yeah, it's not a handshake.
[55:10.490 --> 55:11.110]  That's a warrior wrist grab.
[55:11.570 --> 55:12.810]  A warrior wrist grab.
[55:13.690 --> 55:14.690]  A warrior wrist grab.
[55:16.550 --> 55:18.010]  I think I'm losing my mind.
[55:18.290 --> 55:18.510]  Yeah.
[55:21.370 --> 55:24.330]  That happens to you somewhere in the process of being on camera.
[55:24.650 --> 55:27.650]  No, I think it's just like that I've got a lot happening.
[55:28.490 --> 55:29.550]  Leonardo da Vinci.
[55:29.630 --> 55:30.310]  In life or right now?
[55:30.410 --> 55:30.830]  Right now.
[55:30.950 --> 55:34.210]  I've got pens that I've got, and then I think I'm ahead, and then there's some over here.
[55:34.950 --> 55:36.610]  And then I got stuff over here.
[55:36.750 --> 55:39.130]  I've got Tyler, the creator, just looking at me with a cigarette.
[55:39.130 --> 55:41.210]  I feel like you gave yourself too many responsibilities here.
[55:41.710 --> 55:42.070]  Classic.
[55:43.530 --> 55:46.090]  Because as a part of the conveyor belt, it kind of fell apart.
[55:47.550 --> 55:49.270]  But you're doing all the important work.
[55:49.810 --> 55:50.910]  Let's do this.
[55:50.970 --> 55:52.950]  Let's open up some Goodwin champions.
[55:53.270 --> 55:55.190]  So, Emily, you love Alan and Ginter, right?
[55:55.430 --> 55:55.730]  I do.
[55:55.870 --> 55:57.690]  Because they have weird stuff, non-sports stuff.
[55:57.770 --> 56:00.610]  They have stuff that I like, but they don't have you in there yet, which is upsetting.
[56:00.630 --> 56:02.290]  Right, we're all upset that I'm not in it.
[56:03.790 --> 56:06.850]  Goodwin champions is Upper Deck's version of Alan and Ginter.
[56:07.090 --> 56:07.410]  Oh.
[56:07.870 --> 56:09.270]  What kind of weird stuff they have.
[56:09.370 --> 56:10.010]  I think so, yeah.
[56:10.010 --> 56:13.330]  Do you think we have a better shot of getting you into a Goodwin champion?
[56:13.470 --> 56:14.730]  Yeah, but who wants to be Goodwin champions?
[56:14.970 --> 56:15.550]  That's true.
[56:17.130 --> 56:17.850]  Oh, shit.
[56:20.710 --> 56:22.050]  See who we got here.
[56:22.210 --> 56:23.290]  Ooh, Tiger Woods.
[56:23.350 --> 56:24.070]  I've heard of him.
[56:25.190 --> 56:26.630]  Uh, Carlos Colmenares.
[56:26.770 --> 56:27.430]  He plays baseball.
[56:27.550 --> 56:28.430]  They don't have the rights.
[56:29.230 --> 56:29.950]  Sahithi Gala.
[56:31.110 --> 56:32.450]  Oh, here we have Brie Baker.
[56:32.610 --> 56:33.310]  She's a chef.
[56:35.310 --> 56:36.430]  Sahithi Gala again.
[56:36.690 --> 56:37.850]  Her name is her job.
[56:39.350 --> 56:41.250]  I wonder if that's why she became a chef.
[56:41.410 --> 56:42.410]  Is she from Top Chef?
[56:43.510 --> 56:44.090]  Let's see.
[56:46.070 --> 56:47.310]  When did you get into hats?
[56:47.490 --> 56:48.410]  She's from Dallas, Texas.
[56:48.730 --> 56:49.870]  Because I have a whole field of them.
[56:49.930 --> 56:50.590]  Why would I get into them?
[56:50.710 --> 56:53.350]  Since her appearance on MasterChef in 2019,
[56:53.910 --> 56:57.530]  she's built her plating queen brand into a successful business located in Dallas.
[56:57.850 --> 56:58.850]  I am into hats.
[56:58.930 --> 57:02.290]  I'm into this fuckface hat that's available now in the store.
[57:02.450 --> 57:03.150]  That's an Eaton hat.
[57:03.230 --> 57:04.010]  That's an Eaton hat.
[57:04.070 --> 57:05.250]  And that's the kind of hat that I'm into.
[57:05.250 --> 57:09.050]  I think you should grow a field of hats somehow.
[57:10.270 --> 57:11.050]  Gabby Butler.
[57:11.370 --> 57:12.710]  She was on that show we watched.
[57:13.110 --> 57:13.330]  Remember?
[57:13.750 --> 57:13.950]  Cheer.
[57:15.210 --> 57:16.150]  Oh, yeah.
[57:16.670 --> 57:17.590]  Yeah, she was one of the cheerleaders.
[57:17.610 --> 57:18.550]  Her mom was kind of popular.
[57:19.030 --> 57:19.890]  Mojave King.
[57:20.770 --> 57:22.330]  Oh, we got the big dog.
[57:22.490 --> 57:23.190]  Joe Biden.
[57:23.710 --> 57:24.170]  Jibadan.
[57:24.550 --> 57:25.030]  Jibadan.
[57:25.550 --> 57:27.090]  And Carlos Colmenares.
[57:27.410 --> 57:27.630]  Nice.
[57:27.970 --> 57:31.850]  Do you think it would be...
[57:31.850 --> 57:33.670]  If I were to have a field of hats,
[57:33.670 --> 57:35.370]  wouldn't that be, like, leather?
[57:35.610 --> 57:36.530]  Like, so I have towels.
[57:37.790 --> 57:38.590]  Tiger Woods?
[57:38.750 --> 57:39.310]  Yeah, pre-hats.
[57:40.150 --> 57:43.630]  Or isn't there, like, a flower called, like, a Turkish hat or something?
[57:43.910 --> 57:44.470]  Oh, I don't know.
[57:44.750 --> 57:45.410]  Maybe I could do that.
[57:45.410 --> 57:47.570]  What the fuck did I just get?
[57:48.650 --> 57:51.470]  Goodwin Champions, number two, Elefunk.
[57:52.010 --> 57:53.530]  What the fuck is this?
[57:53.870 --> 57:54.150]  Elefunk.
[57:54.150 --> 57:54.810]  What's Elefunk?
[57:54.870 --> 57:55.310]  Is that a...
[57:55.870 --> 57:56.810]  What does it say on the back?
[57:56.930 --> 57:57.290]  Nothing.
[57:57.490 --> 57:58.750]  This is Goodwin Champions.
[57:59.750 --> 58:00.190]  What?
[58:00.950 --> 58:01.830]  Just Elefunk?
[58:01.830 --> 58:02.810]  Oh, yeah.
[58:03.030 --> 58:03.570]  I don't know.
[58:03.650 --> 58:03.770]  Weird.
[58:04.130 --> 58:04.930]  Should that go to someone?
[58:05.290 --> 58:05.490]  No.
[58:05.670 --> 58:05.830]  No?
[58:05.950 --> 58:06.510]  You want to keep it?
[58:06.650 --> 58:07.690]  Paid Spirinac.
[58:07.910 --> 58:08.430]  Woo you.
[58:11.570 --> 58:11.930]  Elo.
[58:14.090 --> 58:15.090]  I'll have to look into that.
[58:15.190 --> 58:16.050]  I'm not sure what's going on there.
[58:16.470 --> 58:19.070]  Tune in, not next week, but the next time we do it.
[58:19.570 --> 58:20.850]  And I'll tell you what it's worth.
[58:21.010 --> 58:22.670]  See us after American Thanksgiving.
[58:23.110 --> 58:23.750]  Great basketball player.
[58:23.810 --> 58:24.590]  Molly McGrath.
[58:24.690 --> 58:25.710]  She's a media personality.
[58:30.270 --> 58:30.990]  Joanna Jedrezic.
[58:31.130 --> 58:31.590]  You got it.
[58:31.590 --> 58:32.130]  MMA.
[58:33.650 --> 58:34.290]  Chloe Kim.
[58:34.950 --> 58:35.270]  Snowboarder.
[58:36.270 --> 58:36.910]  Bayron Lora.
[58:37.030 --> 58:37.690]  Baseball player.
[58:37.950 --> 58:39.490]  Is Thanksgiving the shittiest holiday?
[58:40.250 --> 58:41.070]  Oh, it's almost over.
[58:41.490 --> 58:41.790]  Yeah.
[58:42.030 --> 58:42.930]  We're supposed to end.
[58:43.150 --> 58:43.370]  Yeah.
[58:43.570 --> 58:44.190]  Nobody told me.
[58:44.330 --> 58:45.510]  Well, I mean, I thought you were...
[58:45.510 --> 58:45.910]  I didn't know.
[58:45.930 --> 58:46.630]  Oh, Woj.
[58:46.910 --> 58:48.290]  I got a lot happening over here.
[58:48.490 --> 58:49.070]  We only have one minute.
[58:49.110 --> 58:49.590]  Here we got a...
[58:49.590 --> 58:51.530]  Oh, a Gatti Michael Jordan basketball card.
[58:51.590 --> 58:52.310]  That's probably worth some money.
[58:52.410 --> 58:52.990]  I'll have to look into that.
[58:54.170 --> 58:54.810]  Jonathan Kuminga.
[58:54.910 --> 58:55.210]  Sarah Winner.
[58:55.270 --> 58:56.110]  I got this silver pack.
[58:56.190 --> 58:57.030]  Let's see what's in the silver pack.
[58:57.350 --> 58:58.510]  We were even going to open...
[58:58.510 --> 58:59.530]  Oh, we didn't even open our jersey.
[58:59.610 --> 59:00.490]  We're going to open an NBA jersey.
[59:01.610 --> 59:02.250]  Isaiah Todd.
[59:03.070 --> 59:03.710]  Ansu Fati.
[59:04.730 --> 59:05.370]  Mike Mancius.
[59:05.830 --> 59:06.150]  Joanna...
[59:06.150 --> 59:07.170]  Alan Iverson card.
[59:07.230 --> 59:07.510]  That's cool.
[59:07.950 --> 59:10.470]  And then we're going to open up this.
[59:10.590 --> 59:11.750]  We got our very own...
[59:11.750 --> 59:12.410]  We got an NBA...
[59:13.430 --> 59:14.330]  Who do you think it is?
[59:14.370 --> 59:14.830]  Name it and...
[59:14.830 --> 59:16.170]  Whose jersey do you think we got?
[59:16.870 --> 59:17.510]  The Dillmeister.
[59:17.610 --> 59:18.570]  I think we got a Steph Curry.
[59:22.270 --> 59:22.910]  We got...
[59:23.830 --> 59:24.550]  Open it up.
[59:25.530 --> 59:26.350]  It's a Ziploc.
[59:27.750 --> 59:28.630]  Someone signed it right there.
[59:28.670 --> 59:29.150]  That's hard to tell.
[59:31.590 --> 59:32.230]  Oh, shit.
[59:32.570 --> 59:33.210]  What is it?
[59:33.290 --> 59:34.510]  Oh, you love Philadelphia.
[59:35.590 --> 59:38.410]  Doesn't play for Philadelphia anymore, but he did wear number one.
[59:39.250 --> 59:39.970]  James Harden.
[59:41.930 --> 59:42.750]  There we go.
[59:42.810 --> 59:44.910]  Very own James Harden jersey.
[59:45.210 --> 59:45.570]  Wow.
[59:45.670 --> 59:46.770]  He doesn't want to play anywhere.
[59:47.330 --> 59:48.590]  He wants to play for the Clippers.
[59:49.050 --> 59:51.970]  But that's a good one to have because he doesn't like this team at all.
[59:52.050 --> 59:52.730]  Like, he fuck-faced himself.
[59:52.730 --> 59:53.570]  He wanted to...
[59:53.570 --> 59:55.470]  He did fuck-face himself and he thought he was going to retire there.
[59:55.650 --> 59:56.490]  So there you go.
[59:56.550 --> 59:58.170]  We're going to end it on a James Harden...
[01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:01.430]  Authentic autographed Phillies jersey.
[01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:02.390]  That's fucking cool.
[01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:03.830]  The ultimate fuck-face jersey.
[01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:04.850]  Wow.
[01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:08.690]  He wanted so desperately to go there and then now he's so upset that he can't leave there.
[01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:10.070]  We got a little piece of the beard.
[01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.710]  Look at us.
[01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:11.590]  We'll hang it up back here.
[01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:12.150]  Yeah, we will.
[01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:13.390]  Maybe that's Gavin's next outfit.
[01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:17.930]  Hey, thanks for hanging out with us for another hour of your life.
[01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.930]  We really appreciate it.
[01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:21.470]  And if you get a chance, go buy a nacho helmet.
[01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:21.970]  Or an ice cream helmet.
[01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:22.630]  They're delicious.
[01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:23.690]  Or a soda helmet.
[01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:24.470]  Here, I'll tell you what.
[01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:25.750]  I'll drink some soda on the way out.
[01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:27.150]  I'll be here for 16 more hours.
[01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:29.150]  We're gonna... we gotta girlmath this.
[01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:31.130]  Oh my god, there's dirt everywhere.
[01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.610]  Mainly in the pen.
[01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:33.390]  There's so many.
[01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:33.950]  Bye.
[01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:36.930]  Chug, chug, chug, chug.
[01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:37.850]  Get it.
[01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:38.470]  You got it.
[01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:40.870]  You turd.
