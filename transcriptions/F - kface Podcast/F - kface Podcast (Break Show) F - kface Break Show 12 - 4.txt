[00:13.260 --> 00:15.700]  Come on over. We need to talk.
[00:16.200 --> 00:16.500]  What?
[00:16.940 --> 00:20.900]  I'm kidding. Hello and welcome to another Bright Show.
[00:20.980 --> 00:26.080]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, mostly, Emily Hatfield.
[00:26.460 --> 00:29.300]  But she's my wife. We have a different last name, but we're married.
[00:29.560 --> 00:29.840]  Yeah.
[00:29.860 --> 00:30.500]  You're my wife now.
[00:30.580 --> 00:31.720]  I'm your wife, Hatfield Ramsey.
[00:32.060 --> 00:34.560]  And then this one, Eric. We're not married.
[00:35.120 --> 00:35.560]  Not yet.
[00:35.620 --> 00:39.480]  Not legally. In the state of Texas, but, you know, who knows?
[00:39.620 --> 00:40.540]  Maybe we'll all move to Utah.
[00:40.960 --> 00:41.240]  Yeah!
[00:43.120 --> 00:46.300]  Anyway, this week, for you, we are going to open up cards.
[00:46.520 --> 00:49.720]  Sports cards, non-sports cards, fun cards, serious cards, all kinds of cards.
[00:49.940 --> 00:50.420]  For me?
[00:50.820 --> 00:52.840]  For you. For you in the audience. For all of you.
[00:52.880 --> 00:53.460]  You looked...
[00:53.460 --> 00:54.220]  For the collective you.
[00:54.340 --> 00:58.320]  You looked dead at me and said, for you, we're going to open cards.
[00:58.400 --> 01:03.160]  You are my proxy for the 7.5 billion potential viewers that we have.
[01:03.220 --> 01:04.300]  Oh, wow. I want to be really clear.
[01:04.840 --> 01:09.080]  There have been rumors and allegations going around this show that I don't want to be here.
[01:09.080 --> 01:11.480]  I love doing this show.
[01:11.880 --> 01:15.460]  I thought Sammy would do a great job from Best Friends Today.
[01:15.840 --> 01:17.720]  And that's why we've commemorated it.
[01:19.280 --> 01:20.560]  He's with us always.
[01:20.700 --> 01:21.380]  He's on my shoulder.
[01:22.020 --> 01:23.440]  Just like you're a little... he's my little Woodstock.
[01:23.440 --> 01:25.080]  Oh, we both have little Woodstocks!
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.080]  Sammy is now officially...
[01:28.960 --> 01:32.160]  Oh, there's the Todd Francis... everybody buy Todd Francis' calendar.
[01:32.380 --> 01:32.620]  Okay.
[01:32.720 --> 01:34.840]  If he's still selling them, too. The great artist, Todd Francis.
[01:35.060 --> 01:35.860]  I'm not good at this.
[01:35.880 --> 01:36.540]  You can see the...
[01:36.540 --> 01:37.160]  Not Vanna.
[01:37.160 --> 01:37.620]  Yeah.
[01:38.400 --> 01:40.360]  It's not a Rooster Teeth thing. It's just a good thing.
[01:40.520 --> 01:40.640]  Yeah.
[01:41.580 --> 01:46.940]  It's a great calendar because it keeps things like Eddie Van Halen's birthday on there and John Belushi's birthday.
[01:47.140 --> 01:48.300]  He has all the Three Stooges' birthdays on there.
[01:48.300 --> 01:49.300]  Failed Insurrection Day.
[01:51.560 --> 01:52.720]  National Hangover Day.
[01:52.980 --> 01:55.420]  They're always... I love the holidays that he puts on there.
[01:55.680 --> 01:56.400]  Yeah, Todd's the best.
[01:57.980 --> 02:03.900]  Anyway, I'd like... I think it's... no offense to Gus or Gavin or anybody else that's appeared on this show in the past.
[02:03.960 --> 02:06.060]  I don't want to miss anybody, but maybe there's more.
[02:06.060 --> 02:08.920]  I think Sammy's probably the best guest we've ever had.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.180]  I agree. I think he was really... I watched the show. Super funny.
[02:12.380 --> 02:15.120]  If you could go back and watch the episode, he was great on it.
[02:15.320 --> 02:18.260]  And he knew very, very much an NBA guy.
[02:18.400 --> 02:21.780]  And I love that you gave him LeBron cards and you just keep going, oh, LeBron.
[02:22.160 --> 02:28.800]  It was so much fun to talk to somebody who was also as much of an NBA fan as I am.
[02:28.940 --> 02:30.920]  It'd be like if I knew as much about wrestling as you do.
[02:32.120 --> 02:34.640]  Just to be able to geek out on the same... to speak the same language.
[02:34.640 --> 02:40.660]  Within two minutes, I realized that Sammy knew... such a young gentleman, too, knew so much about the NBA.
[02:40.800 --> 02:41.440]  It was such a joy.
[02:42.060 --> 02:47.280]  Someone in the chat just said that it wasn't you that doesn't like being here, but it was your mustache.
[02:47.640 --> 02:49.680]  Oh, that's true. My mustache couldn't make it anymore.
[02:50.040 --> 02:52.060]  So many people are like, oh, why did you shave?
[02:52.180 --> 02:56.580]  It's like, I don't like having just one look for a long time. It really bothers me.
[02:56.700 --> 02:59.640]  Because people go, this is you. This is what you look like.
[02:59.880 --> 03:00.700]  You got to keep it to yourself.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.780]  On our first date, Emily and I... I wish I would have planned this better.
[03:05.860 --> 03:06.860]  Our first date, I had a beard.
[03:07.060 --> 03:07.580]  Oh, yeah.
[03:07.780 --> 03:10.560]  And so now I have a beard for the rest of my life.
[03:10.760 --> 03:12.360]  I shaved it once and she said, no.
[03:13.280 --> 03:13.540]  No.
[03:14.200 --> 03:15.480]  I don't like your face.
[03:15.740 --> 03:18.960]  She said, I don't like... it's too much of you.
[03:19.180 --> 03:19.360]  Yeah.
[03:19.560 --> 03:20.660]  I don't... cover it.
[03:20.920 --> 03:21.140]  Yep.
[03:21.260 --> 03:22.540]  Cover it as quickly as you can.
[03:22.960 --> 03:26.580]  No, I like your face. I just like it when there's shadows to it.
[03:26.680 --> 03:27.140]  I get it.
[03:27.760 --> 03:28.940]  It's like contouring.
[03:30.380 --> 03:33.600]  But I can't have it too long because I don't want to kiss your mustache.
[03:33.840 --> 03:34.660]  I want to kiss your little lips.
[03:35.520 --> 03:36.320]  She... yeah.
[03:36.600 --> 03:37.000]  Yeah.
[03:37.160 --> 03:37.920]  We're fine. We're fine.
[03:38.480 --> 03:39.280]  We're fine!
[03:39.480 --> 03:41.800]  The regular thing you say when you're fine.
[03:42.160 --> 03:45.420]  Hey, if you're watching this live right now, 10 a.m. tomorrow, guess what's on sale?
[03:46.140 --> 03:47.260]  Beanhole dirt pen!
[03:47.680 --> 03:48.400]  10 a.m. tomorrow.
[03:48.600 --> 03:49.020]  Do we have one?
[03:49.120 --> 03:49.260]  Yeah.
[03:49.580 --> 03:51.380]  Wow! Beanhole dirt pen.
[03:51.540 --> 03:53.100]  Own a piece of our property.
[03:53.460 --> 03:55.620]  This is dirt from their backyard.
[03:55.920 --> 03:56.620]  American only.
[03:56.620 --> 03:58.000]  Cooked in Tony's oven.
[03:58.160 --> 03:59.400]  It has been. It's true.
[03:59.500 --> 04:03.500]  And then lovingly placed into the pens by employees here at Rooster Teeth.
[04:03.940 --> 04:07.420]  The whole merch team was going, hey, so we're just going to like fill all these.
[04:07.520 --> 04:08.900]  And I was like, I mean, yeah.
[04:08.900 --> 04:11.460]  I was like, I was on honeymoon or I would have helped them do it.
[04:11.480 --> 04:13.000]  I mean, it is real actual dirt.
[04:13.300 --> 04:14.740]  Gavin and I filled some.
[04:15.140 --> 04:15.500]  You did.
[04:15.760 --> 04:18.100]  And the hole is still there in our backyard.
[04:18.180 --> 04:18.940]  Yes, it is.
[04:19.060 --> 04:21.700]  And Tony said, we have a bunch of dirt left over. What should we do with it?
[04:21.880 --> 04:23.960]  And Gavin said, we could put it in the big hole.
[04:23.960 --> 04:25.020]  I was like, I'll take it back.
[04:25.080 --> 04:26.540]  And he's like, I dumped most of it out already.
[04:29.260 --> 04:32.500]  10 a.m. tomorrow if you're watching this live.
[04:32.640 --> 04:34.420]  If you're watching this taped, they're probably sold out.
[04:34.520 --> 04:36.000]  But you can go check store.roosterteeth.com.
[04:38.120 --> 04:42.560]  I'm just saying it's only for Americans because I don't want people to get upset because people got upset at the idea of it.
[04:42.940 --> 04:44.740]  And then now they're going to be like, why couldn't I buy it?
[04:44.780 --> 04:45.680]  But it's because people got upset.
[04:45.780 --> 04:50.700]  Even though when we were in Mexico, you could buy sand in a thing, which is somehow OK.
[04:50.700 --> 04:54.500]  It's because laws aren't real.
[04:54.660 --> 04:55.780]  So you can just kind of do whatever you want.
[04:56.060 --> 04:56.100]  Right.
[04:57.060 --> 04:58.140]  But don't worry.
[04:58.300 --> 05:05.720]  There's people online that are watching very, very closely and going, actually, here's what I know.
[05:05.860 --> 05:08.480]  And I go, oh, blocked, unblocked.
[05:08.480 --> 05:09.960]  Here's why we're not selling it.
[05:10.180 --> 05:14.240]  We looked into it a little bit because we thought like, oh, if we don't know, we'll just ask for forgiveness.
[05:14.240 --> 05:14.640]  Right.
[05:14.840 --> 05:20.020]  But it's possible that every pin sold outside of the United States could have been a separate and individual offense.
[05:20.020 --> 05:20.740]  Oh, that's cool.
[05:20.920 --> 05:24.380]  So if we sold like 500 of them, that could have been like 500 fines.
[05:24.480 --> 05:24.640]  Yeah.
[05:24.760 --> 05:25.420]  Or whatever.
[05:26.220 --> 05:26.380]  So.
[05:28.640 --> 05:29.560]  Jack Warner and his brother.
[05:29.560 --> 05:32.160]  Once again, the rest of the world gets fucked by America.
[05:32.280 --> 05:33.000]  That's right, baby.
[05:33.800 --> 05:34.180]  Boom.
[05:34.940 --> 05:36.120]  Red, white, blue.
[05:37.540 --> 05:38.480]  Also, go Celtics.
[05:38.660 --> 05:38.840]  Right.
[05:38.900 --> 05:47.820]  Tonight, in just a few short hours, in two hours and 24 minutes, your Boston Celtics are going to be facing off against the Indiana Pacers.
[05:49.760 --> 05:56.820]  Benedict Mathurin and Miles Turner and Tyrese Halliburton and Andrew Nembhard.
[05:57.500 --> 06:00.420]  And we don't like them.
[06:00.540 --> 06:01.740]  We want the Celtics to win.
[06:01.760 --> 06:01.940]  That's right.
[06:02.060 --> 06:05.900]  I want Al Horford to win $500,000.
[06:06.500 --> 06:07.100]  I do too.
[06:07.160 --> 06:07.860]  He deserves it.
[06:07.940 --> 06:08.900]  Yeah, Al Horford.
[06:09.220 --> 06:13.480]  Me and Al Horford are the same age and he is playing in the NBA.
[06:13.480 --> 06:17.740]  He clearly still needs the money, so let's help the man out.
[06:18.420 --> 06:19.860]  Win the whole damn thing, Al.
[06:20.460 --> 06:20.780]  Goddamn.
[06:20.940 --> 06:21.240]  Anyway.
[06:21.460 --> 06:21.760]  What do you got?
[06:22.180 --> 06:22.600]  Go Celtics.
[06:23.800 --> 06:25.720]  We got a bunch of stuff to open today.
[06:25.780 --> 06:26.260]  Emily, what were you saying?
[06:26.260 --> 06:29.460]  Well, I was trying to be more involved in the chat because we were talking about that earlier.
[06:29.520 --> 06:31.320]  For when you watch it live, then we can have the chat.
[06:31.460 --> 06:34.540]  And since I'm the people's princess, I can be the conversation between them.
[06:34.560 --> 06:35.160]  The people's princess?
[06:35.160 --> 06:36.860]  Is this what's been going on since I've been gone?
[06:37.020 --> 06:37.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:37.800 --> 06:40.320]  We got married and I kind of got big for my britches.
[06:40.320 --> 06:45.740]  But someone asked a really, really important question that I feel like we could answer.
[06:46.000 --> 06:51.780]  They were asking about, in our tiny town, how do we connect all the houses together to one power source?
[06:51.860 --> 06:58.840]  And I just really needed to let y'all know that you can get these things where it's one plug and it goes to five different light bulbs.
[06:59.040 --> 07:01.640]  So then it's only one plug that can light up our light bulbs.
[07:01.640 --> 07:02.740]  And then it daisy chains?
[07:02.980 --> 07:06.520]  And then it daisy chains and then you just turn it off at night because it could be a fire.
[07:06.880 --> 07:08.960]  But you turn it off at night or when you leave the house.
[07:08.960 --> 07:12.940]  I have three switches I gotta turn off at night before I can go to bed.
[07:13.100 --> 07:13.960]  They're all related to it.
[07:14.160 --> 07:15.520]  Do you guys want to talk about cards for a minute?
[07:15.660 --> 07:18.380]  I mean, I guess. What are we, 10 minutes in? Yeah, let's do it.
[07:18.540 --> 07:24.260]  Last week, we got a bunch of cards, got some hits. And you know what I like to do is I like to then take them and price them out.
[07:24.320 --> 07:24.760]  Let us know.
[07:24.860 --> 07:27.940]  I go by eBay sold, sometimes I go to 130point.com, whatever.
[07:28.060 --> 07:31.880]  But I find what they've been selling for, not what they could sell for, but what they've actually sold for.
[07:31.920 --> 07:33.340]  That's very important to know.
[07:33.480 --> 07:37.040]  A lot of people in this collecting scene are dumb.
[07:37.160 --> 07:37.320]  Yeah.
[07:37.320 --> 07:40.500]  They'll get a card and they'll go, I wonder how much it's worth.
[07:40.640 --> 07:44.440]  And then they'll go to eBay and they'll go, you know, Mark McGuire, 85 tops.
[07:44.640 --> 07:47.800]  And then they'll say, somebody's selling it for $5,000.
[07:48.040 --> 07:49.760]  And you go, oh, it's worth $5,000. But it's not.
[07:49.880 --> 07:52.280]  It's not actually not. It's only worth what people will pay for it.
[07:52.280 --> 07:53.420]  So you gotta search by sold.
[07:55.360 --> 07:57.280]  So I have prepared the hits for you.
[07:57.380 --> 08:01.500]  Also, as you know, Eric, you weren't here for it, but we did the PSA unboxing.
[08:01.720 --> 08:01.960]  Yes.
[08:02.040 --> 08:03.520]  We got our cards back from PSA.
[08:03.740 --> 08:05.540]  So the first card I wanted to show you guys.
[08:05.540 --> 08:06.020]  Here we go.
[08:06.020 --> 08:11.140]  This is our McGuire PSA 8, 1985 tops and 8.
[08:11.740 --> 08:13.880]  Do you want to guess the number and then I'll choose over or under?
[08:14.180 --> 08:15.480]  Yeah. What do you think it's worth?
[08:15.600 --> 08:19.740]  First off, I think $5,400 is what it was potentially worth as a PSA 10.
[08:19.980 --> 08:23.640]  I think it's worth $250.
[08:24.140 --> 08:24.320]  Okay.
[08:24.460 --> 08:25.040]  I'll do the over.
[08:25.700 --> 08:26.080]  Okay.
[08:26.460 --> 08:27.260]  I have hope.
[08:28.900 --> 08:32.800]  All right. It is worth, as a PSA 8, $25.
[08:33.360 --> 08:34.160]  Oh, God.
[08:35.440 --> 08:35.860]  Yeah.
[08:36.460 --> 08:37.920]  One-tenth of what I guessed.
[08:37.960 --> 08:38.700]  Yeah, it's worth dog shit.
[08:38.900 --> 08:39.140]  It's nothing.
[08:39.820 --> 08:41.300]  It's a big difference between an 8 and a 10.
[08:41.440 --> 08:41.820]  Okay.
[08:42.120 --> 08:43.200]  Wow, that sucks.
[08:43.320 --> 08:43.920]  Yes, that sucks.
[08:44.500 --> 08:45.660]  What do we got here?
[08:45.740 --> 08:46.680]  It's what I expected, honestly.
[08:46.960 --> 08:58.320]  The 1980 top scoring leader Larry Bird Magic Johnson rookie card that I bought at the Austin Citywide garage sale that I thought was real.
[08:58.460 --> 08:59.540]  I did my due diligence.
[08:59.820 --> 08:59.940]  Yeah.
[09:00.040 --> 09:02.640]  I know it's in terrible condition.
[09:02.640 --> 09:11.240]  I paid $300 for it, and I sent it off to PSA to see if it's real, because I wasn't sure it was real, even though I did all the checks.
[09:12.000 --> 09:12.900]  PSA came back.
[09:13.000 --> 09:13.880]  It's a PSA 4.
[09:14.000 --> 09:15.120]  Jesus Christ.
[09:15.280 --> 09:16.880]  Obviously, got a terrible grade.
[09:17.220 --> 09:18.160]  I expected it to.
[09:18.320 --> 09:19.680]  The back is severely miscut.
[09:20.340 --> 09:20.620]  Wow.
[09:20.680 --> 09:21.520]  That's fine.
[09:21.700 --> 09:23.020]  I just needed to know it's real.
[09:23.260 --> 09:23.860]  It's real.
[09:23.980 --> 09:24.300]  Wow.
[09:24.740 --> 09:26.400]  However, it's also worth $600.
[09:27.300 --> 09:28.980]  Whoa, a PSA 4?
[09:29.360 --> 09:30.840]  Yeah, I doubled my money on this fucker.
[09:30.840 --> 09:33.840]  A PSA 4 is worth that much?
[09:33.860 --> 09:34.900]  Well, it's Larry Bird's rookie card.
[09:34.980 --> 09:35.980]  Holy shit.
[09:36.920 --> 09:37.960]  So, and it's got Dr. J on it.
[09:38.000 --> 09:39.320]  I mean, it's a fucking awesome card.
[09:39.640 --> 09:40.000]  Classic.
[09:40.420 --> 09:41.540]  It's an iconic card.
[09:41.620 --> 09:42.660]  It's up there with the Jordan card.
[09:42.720 --> 09:44.120]  It's not as iconic as the Jordan card.
[09:44.120 --> 09:46.280]  Is that our most valuable card?
[09:48.160 --> 09:49.080]  It's up there.
[09:49.760 --> 09:50.920]  Of what we've opened here?
[09:50.960 --> 09:51.680]  Yeah, I think so.
[09:51.680 --> 09:54.180]  And everybody on there is still alive.
[09:54.220 --> 09:55.260]  Of what we've shown on here.
[09:55.740 --> 09:56.860]  Yeah, for now.
[09:57.040 --> 09:57.340]  For now.
[09:57.400 --> 09:59.960]  Oh, and then they're going to be like, oh, in two years, you killed this person.
[10:00.700 --> 10:03.880]  Oh, you've been on the Reddit, I see.
[10:04.200 --> 10:05.060]  Ah, yes, yes.
[10:05.460 --> 10:08.040]  So, I have some other prices for the rest of the cards.
[10:08.140 --> 10:10.880]  We then opened up a box of the new NBA Hoops, this year's Hoops.
[10:10.900 --> 10:12.060]  Hoops is low tier.
[10:12.240 --> 10:14.820]  It's like the lowest tier of acceptable cards to buy, I would say.
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.020]  Not worth a lot.
[10:16.360 --> 10:18.940]  Typically, they're worth a little bit of money when they first come out.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.960]  And then that value will just continue to drop as the season goes on.
[10:22.260 --> 10:25.080]  So, I would keep that in mind because I was surprised by some of these card values.
[10:25.440 --> 10:29.440]  Just a Steph Curry extreme team gold foil insert.
[10:29.440 --> 10:31.320]  I wouldn't think this would be worth a lot of money.
[10:31.620 --> 10:32.400]  What do you think it is?
[10:33.780 --> 10:35.820]  $4.50, $4.00, like $4.50.
[10:36.520 --> 10:37.300]  I'll take the under.
[10:37.500 --> 10:39.140]  This motherfucker is selling for $8.00.
[10:39.300 --> 10:39.640]  Wow!
[10:40.020 --> 10:42.720]  It probably won't like in a month, but right now it's selling for $8.00.
[10:42.780 --> 10:47.060]  This Wimby NBA Hoops, I don't know, it's an alternate version.
[10:47.060 --> 10:47.380]  What do you think?
[10:48.520 --> 10:48.720]  Over.
[10:49.280 --> 10:50.680]  Base card, $12.00.
[10:50.680 --> 10:50.980]  Wow!
[10:51.800 --> 10:52.740]  I'm surprised by that.
[10:53.140 --> 10:56.600]  This LeBron James attack the rack insert, I've never seen before.
[10:56.760 --> 10:57.920]  I thought maybe it was a case hit.
[10:58.000 --> 10:58.380]  It's not.
[10:58.380 --> 10:59.660]  No, I'd say $4.00.
[10:59.960 --> 11:00.200]  Yeah.
[11:00.700 --> 11:01.060]  Under.
[11:01.280 --> 11:01.760]  $5.00.
[11:01.920 --> 11:02.180]  Wow!
[11:02.860 --> 11:04.600]  Once again, that's what this stuff is selling for now.
[11:04.680 --> 11:05.760]  We'll see what it sells for in a month.
[11:07.300 --> 11:09.980]  Joker Road to the Finals, numbered to $4.99.
[11:10.380 --> 11:11.520]  I don't like these cards.
[11:11.660 --> 11:12.500]  I think that's an early sell.
[11:12.500 --> 11:12.900]  They're in it every year.
[11:13.040 --> 11:13.240]  Yeah.
[11:14.140 --> 11:15.260]  Surprised by the value of this.
[11:15.460 --> 11:15.800]  Really?
[11:15.980 --> 11:16.240]  What do you think?
[11:16.240 --> 11:16.840]  I'll say $7.00.
[11:17.080 --> 11:17.300]  Over.
[11:17.560 --> 11:18.420]  $20.00.
[11:18.420 --> 11:18.700]  Wow!
[11:18.740 --> 11:19.840]  People are buying that for...
[11:19.840 --> 11:21.000]  I guess it's because of the...
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.580]  We got a lot of money last week.
[11:22.640 --> 11:22.920]  Yeah, we did.
[11:22.920 --> 11:27.260]  Bryce McGowan's Rookies, Fast Break, Otto.
[11:27.340 --> 11:28.780]  I don't even know who the fuck he is.
[11:29.000 --> 11:29.740]  $12.00.
[11:29.880 --> 11:30.240]  Under.
[11:30.840 --> 11:31.500]  $25.00.
[11:31.800 --> 11:32.160]  Wow!
[11:32.700 --> 11:33.220]  This is a...
[11:33.220 --> 11:33.640]  $25.00.
[11:33.780 --> 11:34.220]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[11:34.300 --> 11:35.400]  It's numbered one to $25.00.
[11:35.480 --> 11:35.740]  Oh, okay.
[11:35.760 --> 11:36.800]  So it's numbered to $25.00.
[11:36.860 --> 11:37.120]  Okay.
[11:37.820 --> 11:39.240]  So it should be worth hundreds of dollars.
[11:39.240 --> 11:40.700]  So maybe Sammy's good luck, too.
[11:40.860 --> 11:42.000]  Yeah, maybe Sammy's good luck.
[11:42.900 --> 11:44.340]  Julian Strother, Otto.
[11:44.520 --> 11:44.840]  Eight bucks.
[11:44.980 --> 11:45.560]  Rookie, Inc.
[11:45.900 --> 11:47.100]  This is a Hoops Rookie, Inc.
[11:47.240 --> 11:47.620]  Not numbered.
[11:47.620 --> 11:47.740]  Under, under.
[11:48.920 --> 11:49.440]  It's $20.00.
[11:49.680 --> 11:49.880]  Wow!
[11:49.880 --> 11:50.740]  God, I suck.
[11:50.780 --> 11:51.320]  I know, I was surprised.
[11:51.800 --> 11:54.340]  And then the true base Wimby Rookie.
[11:55.000 --> 11:55.340]  What do you think?
[11:58.530 --> 12:00.530]  I think this is probably $7.00.
[12:01.350 --> 12:01.750]  Okay.
[12:02.110 --> 12:04.630]  It is currently selling for $15.00.
[12:04.930 --> 12:05.030]  Wow.
[12:05.470 --> 12:09.650]  If you have this card, I would recommend selling it for $15.00 today, because it's going to
[12:09.650 --> 12:15.270]  be worth $2.00 after all the Wimby cards flood the market, and then it won't be worth anything
[12:15.270 --> 12:16.010]  again for 10 years.
[12:16.150 --> 12:16.270]  Yeah.
[12:16.570 --> 12:18.590]  So if you have that card, sell it immediately.
[12:18.890 --> 12:19.090]  Dang.
[12:19.350 --> 12:19.750]  Okay.
[12:19.750 --> 12:20.190]  Okay.
[12:20.530 --> 12:23.510]  So for fun stuff we're going to do today, I think we're going to end with this.
[12:23.830 --> 12:25.010]  We have this box.
[12:25.150 --> 12:25.650]  What is this?
[12:25.870 --> 12:25.990]  Box?
[12:26.250 --> 12:26.810]  A box?
[12:26.950 --> 12:27.110]  A box?
[12:27.930 --> 12:28.850]  We don't know.
[12:29.150 --> 12:30.950]  I asked Gracie to buy it a while back.
[12:31.170 --> 12:31.930]  She gave it to me.
[12:32.030 --> 12:33.190]  I don't remember what it is.
[12:33.470 --> 12:36.690]  It's the, like, relics of the past or something.
[12:36.970 --> 12:38.590]  So it could be, like, a dinosaur bone.
[12:39.010 --> 12:39.750]  It could be...
[12:40.590 --> 12:42.230]  Like a president, maybe.
[12:42.790 --> 12:43.110]  Oh, yeah.
[12:43.110 --> 12:45.670]  Maybe more art cards, like Van Gogh or Rembrandt.
[12:46.030 --> 12:47.130]  What do you think it is?
[12:47.250 --> 12:48.970]  Oh, I don't think it's any of those things.
[12:48.970 --> 12:50.130]  I don't know.
[12:50.230 --> 12:51.070]  We'll have to find out.
[12:51.210 --> 12:53.410]  It could be, like, maybe Winston Churchill's toilet paper.
[12:53.530 --> 12:54.130]  Like, who knows?
[12:54.330 --> 12:56.270]  It could be a part of, like, Jackie O's dress.
[12:56.390 --> 12:56.970]  Oh, it could be.
[12:57.010 --> 12:58.750]  Oh, it could be a part of Monica Lewinsky's dress.
[12:59.330 --> 12:59.610]  Ooh.
[13:00.190 --> 13:01.530]  There's a little part I want off of that one.
[13:01.570 --> 13:01.930]  Right, brother?
[13:02.230 --> 13:02.630]  Hell yeah.
[13:03.770 --> 13:04.310]  Hell yeah.
[13:04.730 --> 13:05.270]  Hell yeah.
[13:05.350 --> 13:07.970]  Gracie is hiding in the bleachers, sitting as low as she can and going...
[13:08.810 --> 13:09.910]  We're also going to do this.
[13:10.190 --> 13:11.910]  I opened up a box of Allen and Ginter.
[13:12.210 --> 13:16.130]  Actually, Emily and I, as a couple, we opened up our own little box of hobby Allen and Ginter yesterday.
[13:16.130 --> 13:19.490]  Is this what we were watching, like, the holiday or something?
[13:19.850 --> 13:21.530]  No, we were watching Four Christmases.
[13:24.890 --> 13:25.930]  And I pulled this.
[13:26.010 --> 13:27.430]  I've never pulled a single rip card.
[13:27.550 --> 13:30.130]  It's a Dansby Swanson, who we agree has a good baseball name.
[13:30.150 --> 13:30.650]  Great baseball name.
[13:30.650 --> 13:31.410]  Number 199.
[13:31.870 --> 13:33.930]  I don't give a shit about Dansby or the Cubs, so we're going to rip it.
[13:34.510 --> 13:36.490]  That's Jordan Levin's team right there.
[13:36.890 --> 13:37.870]  I know, and I love Jordan.
[13:37.950 --> 13:39.430]  That's our boss's boss?
[13:39.530 --> 13:41.050]  Yeah, but I'm a White Sox fan, so...
[13:41.770 --> 13:42.410]  Oh, okay.
[13:42.410 --> 13:46.150]  But as with all things, we've got to start with the pack sack.
[13:46.510 --> 13:48.250]  Boy, you really had to...
[13:48.250 --> 13:48.850]  I can never remember.
[13:49.170 --> 13:49.970]  The sack pack.
[13:50.250 --> 13:52.210]  Today we're going to open... ooh, Desert Storm.
[13:54.110 --> 13:55.430]  I missed Desert Storm.
[13:55.670 --> 13:56.850]  That was Desert Storm sound.
[13:57.510 --> 13:59.150]  That was the sound of liberation.
[14:00.150 --> 14:01.290]  Yeah, or this one.
[14:03.070 --> 14:04.010]  Those are our 14s.
[14:04.030 --> 14:04.650]  Yeah, that's pretty good.
[14:05.790 --> 14:06.890]  I missed Desert Storm.
[14:07.010 --> 14:07.990]  I missed it, but just by a little bit.
[14:08.090 --> 14:10.950]  Like, in your heart, you were like, oh, Desert Storm.
[14:10.950 --> 14:13.610]  No, it was in 91, and I was in the Army in 93.
[14:14.050 --> 14:15.210]  I missed it by, like, two years.
[14:15.570 --> 14:18.890]  Did it cross your mind, like, when you were like, I'm going to get the fuck out of Alabama
[14:18.890 --> 14:20.010]  and join the Army to get out of here?
[14:20.010 --> 14:20.730]  That I might die to do it?
[14:20.810 --> 14:20.910]  Yeah.
[14:20.910 --> 14:23.790]  No, but that you were like, ugh, I hope they wrap this up.
[14:24.010 --> 14:28.010]  Or did you go into the Army thinking, like, I'm going to have to go to Desert Storm?
[14:28.330 --> 14:29.310]  Because it was still going on.
[14:29.350 --> 14:30.470]  Like, you don't always know when an Army is over.
[14:30.470 --> 14:31.690]  It was over before I joined.
[14:31.890 --> 14:32.210]  Okay.
[14:32.390 --> 14:33.790]  I joined during a time of peace.
[14:34.130 --> 14:36.990]  Typically, the best time to join... by the way, if you ever get a chance, the best time
[14:36.990 --> 14:39.110]  to join the military is typically right after a war.
[14:39.230 --> 14:39.350]  Yeah.
[14:39.350 --> 14:39.770]  Yeah.
[14:40.030 --> 14:41.350]  Because you're not going to have another one for a while.
[14:41.410 --> 14:42.390]  They tend to stretch those things out.
[14:42.390 --> 14:46.030]  Now, I will say, I don't know when the last time that was...
[14:46.030 --> 14:46.670]  True.
[14:46.810 --> 14:47.050]  ...was.
[14:48.150 --> 14:48.510]  Yeah.
[14:49.070 --> 14:50.510]  Because we've been in a war with Afghanistan.
[14:50.530 --> 14:52.170]  We were in a war with Afghanistan for, like, 20 years.
[14:52.190 --> 14:57.370]  I think if I joined right now, me and Josh Flanagan will have served in the exact same war.
[14:58.370 --> 14:59.150]  How old are you?
[14:59.630 --> 14:59.990]  37.
[15:01.050 --> 15:02.430]  I think you might be able to join soon.
[15:02.450 --> 15:02.810]  Yeah!
[15:02.990 --> 15:03.510]  Might be the cutoff.
[15:04.150 --> 15:05.010]  Sunset in the desert.
[15:05.230 --> 15:05.590]  Wow.
[15:05.770 --> 15:06.850]  Is that an oil rig?
[15:07.190 --> 15:08.250]  No, that's a satellite.
[15:08.250 --> 15:09.550]  Yeah, it's probably some signal thing.
[15:09.950 --> 15:13.670]  I gotta say, after spending about a year in the desert of Kuwait, it is pretty beautiful.
[15:13.730 --> 15:13.830]  Yeah.
[15:14.110 --> 15:15.290]  At times. In places.
[15:15.790 --> 15:17.210]  A lot of it's not. A lot of it's not.
[15:17.210 --> 15:18.070]  There it is, your president.
[15:18.190 --> 15:19.750]  That's your favorite president, isn't it?
[15:21.990 --> 15:25.750]  I know that you were trying to make a case for Reagan, but we think you're probably a Bush guy.
[15:25.770 --> 15:28.570]  I feel like you just really... and you like the legacy that he has left.
[15:28.690 --> 15:32.030]  I like presidents that balance the budget and get blowjobs.
[15:32.030 --> 15:32.210]  I remember...
[15:32.210 --> 15:33.010]  That's what I like.
[15:33.070 --> 15:37.550]  I remember you were saying, when he went to that Astros game and he held up the baseball
[15:37.550 --> 15:40.090]  while he was in the wheelchair, you were like, that was my favorite moment.
[15:41.990 --> 15:43.130]  Somebody had him on pause.
[15:46.590 --> 15:47.730]  You should make fun of it!
[15:47.770 --> 15:49.090]  No, I'm gonna make fun of George Bush. I don't give a fuck.
[15:49.170 --> 15:49.790]  Unpause, George.
[15:50.650 --> 15:53.430]  There's an E3A Sentry.
[15:53.610 --> 15:54.070]  What's that on top?
[15:54.770 --> 15:55.330]  That's a...
[15:55.330 --> 15:55.750]  Satellite radar.
[15:56.110 --> 15:56.910]  Yeah, it's sort of...
[15:56.910 --> 15:58.450]  Is it called the AWACS, I think, now?
[15:58.450 --> 15:58.850]  It's like a ding dong.
[15:59.210 --> 15:59.830]  U.S.S.
[16:00.470 --> 16:01.590]  That's like the top ten, but...
[16:01.590 --> 16:02.010]  U.S.S. Midway.
[16:02.470 --> 16:03.050]  That's right.
[16:03.730 --> 16:05.430]  Here's a U.H.1 Huey.
[16:05.430 --> 16:10.990]  That was us in Hawaii when you fuckin' paid extra to have the doors taken off on the helicopter ride that I cried the entire way through.
[16:11.130 --> 16:12.330]  Oh, I remember that!
[16:12.390 --> 16:12.550]  That's true.
[16:12.870 --> 16:15.650]  It was a much smaller... it was literally the Magnum P.I.
[16:15.650 --> 16:16.710]  It was a Magnum P.I. one.
[16:16.710 --> 16:17.130]  Much smaller.
[16:17.450 --> 16:18.290]  Mission accomplished!
[16:19.390 --> 16:20.110]  Hey, that's top ten!
[16:20.450 --> 16:22.130]  Remember when his kid said that?
[16:22.230 --> 16:25.990]  Remember when his dumbass kid was on that boat and he played dress-up and he said, mission accomplished?
[16:26.110 --> 16:27.150]  I'm in a flight suit!
[16:27.250 --> 16:28.490]  Anyway, we're still in that...
[16:28.490 --> 16:29.550]  Now watch this drive.
[16:29.810 --> 16:34.030]  Hummer Land Vehicle, as opposed to a Hummer Air or a Hummer Sea Vehicle.
[16:34.030 --> 16:34.770]  Hummer Sea Vehicle?
[16:34.770 --> 16:35.930]  What a stupid fuckin'...
[16:35.930 --> 16:37.070]  That's what people drive around in.
[16:37.410 --> 16:37.730]  Skud.
[16:38.330 --> 16:38.650]  Wow.
[16:39.010 --> 16:39.510]  That's pretty cool.
[16:39.550 --> 16:40.250]  Does that shoot missiles?
[16:40.590 --> 16:42.030]  Yeah, that's what a Skud missile is.
[16:44.150 --> 16:44.910]  There you go.
[16:45.430 --> 16:47.110]  So that's what the pack sack had for us.
[16:47.270 --> 16:47.770]  Good one today.
[16:48.150 --> 16:48.930]  Rip, rip, rip, rip, rip.
[16:49.010 --> 16:49.710]  Let's rip this bitch up.
[16:50.370 --> 16:55.470]  One of these days, we're gonna rip... we're gonna get an Allen again to rip and we're gonna rip it and we're gonna get a good-ass card.
[16:55.730 --> 16:56.230]  We'll get a one-of-a-kind.
[16:56.890 --> 16:58.510]  We'll get a winning card.
[16:58.690 --> 16:59.170]  We'll get an auto.
[16:59.170 --> 17:00.250]  Wait, who do we think that is?
[17:00.250 --> 17:00.730]  That's Aaron Judge.
[17:01.030 --> 17:01.710]  Is it Aaron Judge?
[17:01.730 --> 17:02.450]  It's clearly Aaron Judge.
[17:02.450 --> 17:03.130]  Oh, I don't know.
[17:03.290 --> 17:03.970]  That's clear.
[17:04.170 --> 17:04.710]  Hey, Emily.
[17:05.130 --> 17:06.450]  That's clearly Aaron Judge.
[17:06.450 --> 17:08.970]  I regret to inform you that it's clearly Aaron Judge.
[17:11.990 --> 17:12.750]  Careful, careful.
[17:13.190 --> 17:13.990]  Look at what we got.
[17:15.490 --> 17:17.650]  A regular... we got the least of the least.
[17:17.770 --> 17:19.410]  A little tiny Aaron Judge card.
[17:19.470 --> 17:20.690]  Just a little Aaron Judge parallel.
[17:20.870 --> 17:22.030]  A little tiny Aaron Judge.
[17:22.290 --> 17:24.350]  Which is interesting because he's a big, tall guy.
[17:24.770 --> 17:25.130]  He is.
[17:25.150 --> 17:25.830]  He's like 6'5".
[17:25.830 --> 17:26.810]  He hits a lot of dingers.
[17:26.990 --> 17:28.510]  He's like 6'6 or 6'7".
[17:28.510 --> 17:30.610]  Do you think you could hit more home runs than he did?
[17:30.710 --> 17:31.090]  Well, that was... no.
[17:31.090 --> 17:33.010]  No, because he set the record.
[17:33.190 --> 17:34.210]  He's younger than me.
[17:34.230 --> 17:36.430]  Yeah, but you hit so many.
[17:36.450 --> 17:37.670]  That's the only... right.
[17:37.890 --> 17:40.270]  And when Aaron Judge does it, they go 410 feet.
[17:40.370 --> 17:41.670]  When Geoff does it, they go about 190.
[17:42.030 --> 17:44.130]  What a goddamn letdown if that's what it was.
[17:44.230 --> 17:44.370]  Yeah.
[17:44.730 --> 17:45.650]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[17:45.770 --> 17:46.590]  I don't know.
[17:46.630 --> 17:47.870]  Do we have any more Aaron...
[17:47.870 --> 17:49.050]  Why are you...
[17:49.050 --> 17:51.010]  Why are you getting your hopes up for these rip cards, man?
[17:51.210 --> 17:51.590]  I know.
[17:51.870 --> 17:52.410]  You can't.
[17:52.570 --> 17:55.350]  We're gonna open up some Back to the Future 2 and cleanse our palate.
[17:55.530 --> 17:56.210]  Oh, this is...
[17:56.210 --> 17:56.550]  Let's take a sports.
[17:56.750 --> 17:57.550]  Where they go to the future.
[17:57.910 --> 17:58.450]  Show me.
[17:58.650 --> 17:58.950]  Flee!
[18:00.570 --> 18:01.510]  Oh, there's a Tesla.
[18:02.090 --> 18:03.050]  That's the Cybertruck.
[18:03.150 --> 18:04.050]  We saw one the other day.
[18:04.070 --> 18:04.950]  We did see a Cybertruck.
[18:05.090 --> 18:06.890]  I don't understand how it's bullet...
[18:06.890 --> 18:07.570]  Well, they're not bulletproof.
[18:07.650 --> 18:08.430]  They're rockproof now.
[18:08.550 --> 18:09.510]  The glass.
[18:09.750 --> 18:09.970]  Yeah.
[18:11.010 --> 18:13.730]  If you get in an accident and you're trapped, how are they supposed to get you out?
[18:13.850 --> 18:14.130]  They don't.
[18:14.330 --> 18:14.670]  Oh, okay.
[18:14.810 --> 18:15.190]  Never mind then.
[18:15.290 --> 18:17.630]  It's like when you buy one of those titanium rings that are like...
[18:17.630 --> 18:18.470]  And you can't cut this off.
[18:18.510 --> 18:18.810]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:18.830 --> 18:19.650]  And you're like, oh, girl.
[18:19.770 --> 18:20.370]  I'll never get fat.
[18:22.150 --> 18:23.390]  Marty's original escape.
[18:25.050 --> 18:26.770]  Marlene comes to call...
[18:26.770 --> 18:28.370]  Here's what I remember about this movie, and I saw it recently.
[18:28.370 --> 18:30.370]  It's just so fucking long.
[18:31.010 --> 18:31.390]  Is that true?
[18:31.450 --> 18:32.350]  It's really long and really weird.
[18:32.550 --> 18:32.910]  And dark.
[18:33.110 --> 18:35.490]  I think that's an actress from Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead.
[18:35.870 --> 18:36.150]  Rose.
[18:36.290 --> 18:37.810]  Which every time they say like...
[18:37.810 --> 18:38.170]  Oh, right on top of Rose.
[18:38.170 --> 18:39.110]  Right on top of Rose.
[18:39.250 --> 18:39.470]  Yeah.
[18:39.730 --> 18:40.810]  Any of those guys flee?
[18:41.070 --> 18:41.650]  No, none of those guys.
[18:41.710 --> 18:42.610]  One of them was Billy Zane.
[18:43.570 --> 18:44.290]  Here's a...
[18:44.730 --> 18:45.470]  Yeah, that's true.
[18:45.830 --> 18:47.030]  Here's a six of all...
[18:47.030 --> 18:47.830]  Here's a...
[18:47.830 --> 18:48.330]  Just that.
[18:48.510 --> 18:49.170]  Just a picture of that.
[18:49.590 --> 18:50.710]  Didn't even bother to describe it.
[18:50.950 --> 18:51.830]  Everything's different.
[18:52.450 --> 18:52.810]  Ooh.
[18:52.910 --> 18:54.310]  Here's a peek into the future.
[18:55.670 --> 18:57.570]  Ooh, mad, murderous bitch.
[18:57.570 --> 18:59.750]  Isn't it 2023 that he goes to?
[19:00.410 --> 19:00.730]  What is...
[19:00.730 --> 19:01.150]  Isn't today...
[19:01.150 --> 19:04.110]  Today is the day that Marty McFly goes back to the future.
[19:04.250 --> 19:05.490]  Yeah, today's the day.
[19:05.750 --> 19:06.830]  Stealing some time.
[19:07.310 --> 19:09.910]  Remember that meme all the time in like the 2010s?
[19:10.030 --> 19:10.730]  You couldn't escape it?
[19:10.790 --> 19:12.630]  The once and future car.
[19:12.750 --> 19:13.110]  All right.
[19:13.230 --> 19:14.130]  Oh, there you go.
[19:14.170 --> 19:14.650]  All right.
[19:15.330 --> 19:16.850]  Media college from the...
[19:17.310 --> 19:18.190]  None of those are ripped.
[19:18.250 --> 19:18.630]  We could rip some of those.
[19:18.630 --> 19:19.790]  We could rip them, though.
[19:20.150 --> 19:21.330]  You know what we could open, though?
[19:21.410 --> 19:21.610]  What's that?
[19:22.230 --> 19:24.230]  Sound effects.
[19:32.010 --> 19:32.810]  Gracie, it's next.
[19:32.810 --> 19:36.330]  There's so much to update you on.
[19:36.350 --> 19:37.370]  She was dating this...
[19:37.370 --> 19:38.170]  It's unfair.
[19:38.630 --> 19:40.390]  She had to get the abortion.
[19:40.730 --> 19:41.310]  No, no.
[19:41.310 --> 19:44.970]  She had to get the abortion because of the photographer that like raped her and like kept her.
[19:45.030 --> 19:45.610]  It was real fucked up.
[19:46.170 --> 19:46.370]  And then...
[19:47.530 --> 19:47.790]  Kidnapped her.
[19:47.790 --> 19:53.030]  And then this guy who was Ray's nephew who came and she was so in love with him.
[19:53.110 --> 19:53.670]  He was so great.
[19:53.670 --> 19:54.150]  He was sweet.
[19:54.270 --> 19:58.790]  And then Sue Ellen started drinking again and then she got in the car to drive and Lucy
[19:59.490 --> 20:01.150]  was like, go stop her, go stop her.
[20:01.230 --> 20:01.630]  So he gets in.
[20:01.730 --> 20:03.770]  He's trying to get the car, like get Sue Ellen to stop driving.
[20:04.110 --> 20:06.850]  And then they get T-boned out front and he dies.
[20:06.970 --> 20:07.170]  Oh, no, no.
[20:07.170 --> 20:07.670]  He dies.
[20:07.990 --> 20:08.910]  He gets paralyzed.
[20:08.910 --> 20:10.110]  He got paralyzed.
[20:10.230 --> 20:11.590]  He ends up in the hospital.
[20:12.030 --> 20:15.910]  Ray pulled the plug on him because his mom asked Ray to.
[20:15.910 --> 20:17.890]  They literally show him pulling the plug.
[20:18.170 --> 20:20.070]  Then Ray had to go on trial for murder.
[20:20.090 --> 20:20.410]  Yes.
[20:20.430 --> 20:21.030]  But he got off.
[20:21.070 --> 20:22.510]  He got acquitted because the Ewings have money.
[20:22.990 --> 20:23.170]  Okay.
[20:23.510 --> 20:24.110]  So you're kind of on that.
[20:24.130 --> 20:24.710]  There's Ray.
[20:24.850 --> 20:25.310]  There's Ray.
[20:25.390 --> 20:27.010]  That's him like on trial, basically.
[20:27.310 --> 20:28.390]  But this is from season one.
[20:28.690 --> 20:32.950]  Yeah, but this is him being like, if he were on trial, where he'd be like, don't ask my
[20:32.950 --> 20:34.110]  mom about it.
[20:35.470 --> 20:36.190]  Now Bobby...
[20:36.190 --> 20:36.810]  Step by step.
[20:37.130 --> 20:37.330]  Yeah.
[20:37.370 --> 20:40.050]  Bobby and Pamela, you know, they were married and they were such a great couple.
[20:40.070 --> 20:41.290]  And then Cliff Barnes is Pamela's brother.
[20:41.610 --> 20:43.070]  They got a divorce.
[20:43.550 --> 20:43.830]  No.
[20:44.130 --> 20:44.330]  Yeah.
[20:44.330 --> 20:46.590]  Because of just bad communication because...
[20:46.590 --> 20:49.290]  Now Bobby is with Priscilla Presley.
[20:49.470 --> 20:50.310]  Yes, Priscilla Presley.
[20:50.310 --> 20:50.690]  His first love.
[20:50.730 --> 20:52.230]  Jenna Wade, if you will.
[20:52.270 --> 20:52.810]  She was in that.
[20:52.990 --> 20:53.150]  Yeah.
[20:53.490 --> 20:54.130]  Yes, for a long time.
[20:54.230 --> 20:57.310]  She's a single mother working at a bar, trying to make it away with her daughter.
[20:57.470 --> 20:57.690]  Yeah.
[20:58.150 --> 21:00.090]  There was some suspicion over who the father was.
[21:00.410 --> 21:03.010]  Pamela got tired of the Ewing-Barnes feud.
[21:03.210 --> 21:04.050]  And that's JR's eye.
[21:04.150 --> 21:04.810]  There's JR's.
[21:04.810 --> 21:05.990]  We're going to put that puzzle together.
[21:06.270 --> 21:07.110]  He, uh...
[21:07.110 --> 21:07.910]  That's a different puzzle.
[21:08.590 --> 21:09.590]  Well, maybe there's a couple.
[21:09.690 --> 21:10.230]  There's jock.
[21:10.310 --> 21:11.590]  Maybe there's a red puzzle and a blue puzzle.
[21:11.650 --> 21:12.570]  That's why they're different colors.
[21:12.830 --> 21:13.630]  I bet that's true.
[21:13.630 --> 21:15.990]  The red puzzle is like the group photo.
[21:16.210 --> 21:16.570]  Yeah.
[21:16.690 --> 21:17.210]  Hell yeah.
[21:17.350 --> 21:17.650]  Okay.
[21:17.770 --> 21:18.510]  Yep, jock's dead.
[21:18.650 --> 21:19.490]  Yeah, he's been dead.
[21:19.850 --> 21:22.570]  But there's a new guy in Miss Ellie's life now that jock's dead.
[21:22.670 --> 21:23.510]  His name is Clayton.
[21:23.910 --> 21:26.730]  And he was the dad of the guy that Pamela was with.
[21:26.930 --> 21:27.610]  Now, you know Clayton.
[21:27.750 --> 21:28.330]  He was on the...
[21:28.330 --> 21:28.610]  He played...
[21:28.610 --> 21:29.510]  He's on the South Park Ranchers.
[21:29.730 --> 21:30.810]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:30.810 --> 21:31.210]  He played ball.
[21:31.330 --> 21:33.990]  And Clayton, also, when he was younger, was on...
[21:33.990 --> 21:35.790]  In that movie, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
[21:35.930 --> 21:36.270]  Oh, got it.
[21:36.270 --> 21:37.150]  Sure, he was one of the guys.
[21:37.190 --> 21:37.270]  Yeah.
[21:37.330 --> 21:37.450]  Cool.
[21:37.790 --> 21:39.130]  And there's Lucy on the phone.
[21:39.270 --> 21:39.470]  Yep.
[21:39.790 --> 21:41.530]  She spoke on the phone on occasion.
[21:41.670 --> 21:47.670]  Because now she's also in love with this other guy who is in love with Sue Ellen because...
[21:48.590 --> 21:50.870]  It's like a Mrs. Robinson type situation.
[21:51.510 --> 21:52.130]  And I don't...
[21:52.130 --> 21:52.630]  He's a young fella.
[21:52.770 --> 21:55.650]  I don't think you mentioned it on the podcast, but for...
[21:55.650 --> 21:59.930]  On the morning of our wedding, I got Geoff a cameo from Sue Ellen.
[22:00.410 --> 22:01.170]  Oh, wow!
[22:01.210 --> 22:02.530]  Yeah, she gave me marital advice.
[22:02.610 --> 22:05.790]  She's like, don't listen to Sue Ellen because her and J.R. had a terrible marriage.
[22:05.790 --> 22:09.190]  She said, now, J.R. and I didn't have a very good marriage, so nothing from that.
[22:09.770 --> 22:10.490]  But, yeah, he got a little...
[22:10.490 --> 22:12.210]  Isn't that so cool that she knows how to use a phone?
[22:12.610 --> 22:12.870]  Hey, Emily.
[22:13.090 --> 22:14.830]  Well, at the end, she was like...
[22:14.830 --> 22:16.430]  You could see her go, oh, okay.
[22:16.630 --> 22:17.230]  How do I...
[22:17.230 --> 22:17.850]  Okay.
[22:18.890 --> 22:19.750]  That's the best.
[22:19.950 --> 22:20.430]  Hey, Emily.
[22:20.690 --> 22:20.910]  Yeah.
[22:21.170 --> 22:21.630]  Hey, Eric.
[22:21.730 --> 22:21.930]  Yeah.
[22:22.130 --> 22:23.490]  Do you guys want to go boy crazy with me?
[22:23.730 --> 22:24.050]  Woo!
[22:25.730 --> 22:26.410]  Let's do it.
[22:26.510 --> 22:27.230]  Gracie can't wait.
[22:27.330 --> 22:28.010]  She's looking over.
[22:28.130 --> 22:29.230]  She can't wait to go boy crazy.
[22:29.430 --> 22:30.210]  Oh, my gosh.
[22:30.270 --> 22:31.350]  We got to figure out who...
[22:31.350 --> 22:32.930]  We should do a fuck, marry, kill.
[22:34.830 --> 22:35.830]  It's getting so hard.
[22:35.970 --> 22:36.410]  All right, here we go.
[22:36.510 --> 22:36.710]  Kill.
[22:36.790 --> 22:37.970]  J.R. from Utah.
[22:38.130 --> 22:38.650]  Not interested.
[22:39.190 --> 22:40.850]  What year did these come out in?
[22:41.030 --> 22:41.570]  That looks like James Van Der Beek.
[22:41.610 --> 22:42.370]  Because that is...
[22:42.370 --> 22:43.150]  He's a cancer.
[22:43.250 --> 22:43.770]  He's sensitive.
[22:43.970 --> 22:44.570]  This guy...
[22:44.570 --> 22:45.650]  What about Andy from Colorado?
[22:45.810 --> 22:47.450]  These are from 1999.
[22:48.370 --> 22:49.150]  Are these from 1999?

[23:02.690 --> 23:02.990]  These are like kids.
[23:02.990 --> 23:04.610]  Cam is going to have some experiences in college.

[23:54.770 --> 23:56.490]  That's why we keep saying that this is our high school class.
[23:56.610 --> 23:58.130]  These people are going, this is...
[23:58.130 --> 24:00.790]  He is legitimately your high school class.

[24:20.330 --> 24:20.650]  Sorry.
[24:21.010 --> 24:21.830]  Ideal traits aren't brunette.
[24:22.190 --> 24:23.130]  Oh, it gets worse.
[24:23.670 --> 24:24.350]  Sense of humor.
[24:24.550 --> 24:25.030]  Don't have that.

[24:34.010 --> 24:34.110]  He will.
[24:34.570 --> 24:35.290]  He definitely did.
[24:35.430 --> 24:36.410]  Please find these people.

[24:47.870 --> 24:48.910]  Yeah, that was only 186.
[24:48.910 --> 24:49.710]  Matt was the one...
[24:50.070 --> 24:50.430]  79!
[24:50.870 --> 24:51.750]  Yeah, that was J.R.
[24:51.810 --> 24:52.910]  Dude, he's still hanging out.
[24:53.130 --> 24:54.070]  He is man crazy.
[24:54.770 --> 24:55.130]  He...
[24:55.130 --> 24:59.050]  If he was born in 79, he was 100% named after J.R. from Dallas.
[24:59.190 --> 24:59.710]  Oh, 100%.
[24:59.710 --> 25:02.530]  86, 78, 85.
[25:02.530 --> 25:06.550]  These are the guys we go to the parties and that you're like, they're older, but you think
[25:06.550 --> 25:09.690]  it's cool when you're that age, but then when you look back, you're like, ooh, they knew
[25:09.690 --> 25:09.830]  how good they were.
[25:09.830 --> 25:12.910]  Why was a 24-year-old hanging out with all these 17-year-olds?
[25:12.950 --> 25:13.930]  Yeah, yeah.
[25:14.450 --> 25:14.790]  Hey, Eric?
[25:14.930 --> 25:15.430]  Yeah, what's up?
[25:15.430 --> 25:18.350]  Do you remember when the Usos returned to help Roman Reigns?
[25:18.430 --> 25:18.850]  I do.
[25:18.930 --> 25:19.710]  They took out...
[25:19.710 --> 25:22.050]  It looks like Dolph Ziggler and probably Baron Corbin.
[25:22.230 --> 25:27.250]  Those Usos are brothers, and now they have split, and you have Jimmy Uso on one side
[25:27.250 --> 25:28.070]  and Jimmy Uso on the other.
[25:28.070 --> 25:28.710]  Family feud.
[25:28.790 --> 25:31.010]  Have you been keeping tabs with Charlotte Flair?
[25:31.010 --> 25:31.170]  Who?
[25:31.490 --> 25:32.450]  Ric Flair's daughter.
[25:32.730 --> 25:33.030]  Oh!
[25:33.570 --> 25:34.690]  Ric Flair's actual daughter.
[25:34.810 --> 25:35.950]  She's great.
[25:36.170 --> 25:36.570]  She's a wrestler.
[25:36.830 --> 25:38.810]  Does she wear, like, the mink coats and stuff too?
[25:38.930 --> 25:40.390]  Yeah, she's wearing her robe right there.
[25:40.610 --> 25:42.550]  What was the thing that he would say?
[25:42.890 --> 25:43.510]  Like, just, woo!
[25:43.930 --> 25:44.710]  Yeah, he would say, woo!
[25:45.150 --> 25:45.810]  Does she do that?
[25:46.110 --> 25:46.870]  She'll woo, yeah.
[25:47.010 --> 25:48.870]  And everyone woos for her, so everyone's wooing.
[25:48.990 --> 25:50.470]  Speaking of Roman Reigns, there he is.
[25:50.470 --> 25:50.870]  Da-da!
[25:51.410 --> 25:51.910]  Da-da!
[25:52.430 --> 25:52.850]  Da-da!
[25:52.850 --> 25:53.130]  Oh!
[25:53.230 --> 25:53.930]  That's the big dog.

[25:55.870 --> 25:57.390]  Yeah, Xavier Woods, awesome.
[25:57.770 --> 25:58.490]  Did he hit you once?
[25:58.490 --> 26:02.090]  No, I was there for that, but I did not get chopped.
[26:03.030 --> 26:03.650]  Great dude.
[26:03.790 --> 26:04.530]  A lot of people did, though.
[26:04.570 --> 26:05.710]  Yeah, does a lot of stuff with kind of funny and everything.
[26:05.950 --> 26:06.710]  Dexter Loomis.
[26:06.730 --> 26:10.310]  Dexter Loomis, he does, like, a serial killer, sort of like, you know, like, never talks,
[26:10.370 --> 26:12.690]  and he wears, like, gloves, and he's, like, spooky looking and everything.
[26:13.750 --> 26:15.050]  Do you know about this?
[26:15.210 --> 26:16.150]  It's Geoff Hardy.
[26:16.510 --> 26:16.990]  That's right.
[26:17.330 --> 26:20.090]  He defeats Sheamus in an Intercontinental Championship tournament match.
[26:20.090 --> 26:21.530]  Yeah, Geoff Hardy is in AEW.
[26:22.050 --> 26:22.370]  Oh.
[26:22.530 --> 26:23.230]  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[26:23.490 --> 26:24.990]  And then this guy, Swerve.
[26:25.110 --> 26:27.210]  Isaiah Swerve Scott, his name is Swerve Strickland.
[26:27.210 --> 26:29.830]  He's on... they strapped a rocket to that guy, man.
[26:29.870 --> 26:31.950]  In AEW, he is, like, the man right now.
[26:31.950 --> 26:32.470]  Oh, he's the dude.
[26:32.470 --> 26:39.230]  He had a Texas Deathmatch with Hangman Adam Page, and Adam Page cut him up so much that
[26:39.230 --> 26:44.090]  he grabbed Swerve Strickland's head and held it over his mouth, and blood dripped into
[26:44.610 --> 26:45.710]  Hangman Page's mouth.
[26:45.790 --> 26:46.050]  Ew!
[26:46.150 --> 26:47.090]  And he fucking spit it in the air.
[26:47.150 --> 26:47.490]  Real blood?
[26:47.530 --> 26:49.230]  Yeah, it was so fucking cool.
[26:49.450 --> 26:53.010]  They hit each other with this chair covered in barbed wire, but the barbed wire went around
[26:53.010 --> 26:53.670]  his fucking throat.
[26:53.830 --> 26:54.670]  Oh, it was so cool.
[26:54.670 --> 26:57.950]  It was, like, the coolest Deathmatch I've ever seen.
[26:58.130 --> 26:58.670]  That's not good.
[26:58.750 --> 26:59.370]  It was so cool.
[26:59.530 --> 27:00.170]  That's not good.
[27:00.270 --> 27:01.530]  It was fucking rad.
[27:02.230 --> 27:03.870]  Like, but that's happening in real life.
[27:03.990 --> 27:04.110]  Yeah.
[27:04.910 --> 27:07.070]  That's not like Sue Ellen getting behind the wheel.
[27:07.510 --> 27:08.590]  So, Venus and Butthead.
[27:08.650 --> 27:09.410]  Venus and Butthead!
[27:09.670 --> 27:10.610]  Dude, they're doing America, bro.
[27:10.610 --> 27:11.350]  That's when they get married.
[27:11.670 --> 27:13.870]  These are wedding cards we got from our friend Hayley.
[27:14.050 --> 27:17.730]  This is from, yeah, from our friend Hayley, whose mom had the stroke and talked like Yoda,
[27:17.830 --> 27:18.610]  but she's fine now.
[27:18.830 --> 27:19.630]  Shout out to Rhonda.
[27:20.530 --> 27:23.290]  Hayley got these for us for our wedding.
[27:23.290 --> 27:24.450]  So this is going to be...
[27:24.450 --> 27:24.850]  Cards for you they are.
[27:25.130 --> 27:28.410]  So some people were asking for our wedding photos, and here they are.
[27:28.790 --> 27:30.330]  There's Emily and I eating.
[27:30.510 --> 27:32.750]  That was y'all at Texas Chili Parlor before the wedding.
[27:33.730 --> 27:34.890]  Oh, Gus has opinions about Texas Chili Parlor.
[27:34.890 --> 27:35.710]  Oh, yes, he does.
[27:36.050 --> 27:37.590]  Well, that was us getting ready.
[27:37.590 --> 27:41.890]  That was when we went back to my hotel room that everybody got ready in, and you and I
[27:41.890 --> 27:44.010]  had to stay there, and it was a disaster.
[27:44.370 --> 27:45.450]  And I was trying to take my hair out.
[27:45.630 --> 27:46.270]  Pest wishes.
[27:46.650 --> 27:47.010]  Okay.
[27:47.210 --> 27:49.290]  That was, I don't know, Buffay.
[27:50.250 --> 27:51.250]  That was Mandela's.
[27:51.410 --> 27:51.570]  Great.
[27:52.310 --> 27:54.410]  That was Most Wanted.
[27:54.410 --> 27:56.770]  That was literally my face all night.
[27:56.910 --> 27:58.070]  I was like, ah, I'm so happy!
[27:59.370 --> 27:59.950]  Mailman.
[28:00.410 --> 28:04.670]  That was Dash and Gavin hitting each other.
[28:05.310 --> 28:07.170]  Gavin fighting with a five-year-old.
[28:08.410 --> 28:08.990]  Rambutt.
[28:09.010 --> 28:10.150]  Oh, that's awesome.
[28:10.230 --> 28:11.230]  That's Joey doing security.
[28:11.310 --> 28:14.010]  That was Joey and Rustin doing the ushery.
[28:14.510 --> 28:15.450]  Customer Suck.
[28:15.550 --> 28:19.510]  That was when I looked out and saw you sitting in the crowd, Eric.
[28:20.750 --> 28:21.550]  Homesweet Cave.
[28:21.690 --> 28:24.370]  That was Gavin and Dash all again.
[28:24.490 --> 28:25.310]  That's fucking awesome.
[28:25.370 --> 28:26.510]  This is how I felt.
[28:27.230 --> 28:28.030]  Yeah, yeah.
[28:28.210 --> 28:29.710]  That was when you lifted my veil.
[28:32.490 --> 28:34.030]  And I went, yum, breakfast.
[28:34.790 --> 28:35.890]  I'm like Beavis.
[28:36.230 --> 28:39.290]  That was me walking up the staircase, trying not to trip.
[28:40.230 --> 28:41.270]  Thanks for coming to our wedding, guys.
[28:41.290 --> 28:41.630]  It was a great wedding.
[28:41.970 --> 28:42.590]  It was really fun.
[28:43.170 --> 28:44.790]  Let's open up some UFC cards.
[28:45.370 --> 28:46.170]  Oh, nice.
[28:46.290 --> 28:47.710]  UFC was just here, wasn't it?
[28:48.110 --> 28:48.890]  Yeah, we didn't go.
[28:48.890 --> 28:50.010]  We talked about going and then we didn't go.
[28:50.110 --> 28:50.690]  I watched it, though.
[28:50.730 --> 28:51.650]  Chris Barnett, rookie.
[28:53.810 --> 28:54.290]  Ciao.
[28:55.870 --> 28:56.990]  There's Alex Perez.
[28:57.890 --> 28:59.250]  Here's Jair Rodriguez.
[29:00.130 --> 29:01.650]  Here's Alexa Grosso.
[29:05.310 --> 29:06.270]  Volkan Ozdemir.
[29:06.770 --> 29:07.350]  That's it.
[29:07.430 --> 29:08.510]  Curtis Blades.
[29:09.570 --> 29:11.090]  Blades is a good last name.
[29:11.150 --> 29:11.510]  That's pretty cool.
[29:11.770 --> 29:12.930]  Alejandra Pantoja.
[29:13.010 --> 29:13.850]  That's a cool looking card.
[29:14.270 --> 29:15.210]  That's a sparkles.
[29:15.310 --> 29:16.170]  Jessica Andrade.
[29:16.710 --> 29:17.690]  We've seen her fight.
[29:18.490 --> 29:20.870]  I don't remember what happened at the UFC one that we watched.
[29:20.950 --> 29:21.230]  It was good.
[29:21.330 --> 29:22.690]  Some people won, some people lost.
[29:22.930 --> 29:26.550]  That one guy, the fight went on too long after he got knocked out.
[29:26.770 --> 29:27.730]  That wasn't cool.
[29:27.890 --> 29:28.370]  We don't like that.
[29:28.390 --> 29:30.530]  Is that the one that Dana White was talking about where he's like, that ref fucked up?
[29:30.830 --> 29:31.270]  Probably, yeah.
[29:31.410 --> 29:32.510]  That was pretty rough, yeah.
[29:33.190 --> 29:33.950]  This will be fun.
[29:34.330 --> 29:34.930]  I got some...
[29:34.930 --> 29:35.470]  Emily, help me.
[29:35.590 --> 29:36.090]  She bought these for me.
[29:36.410 --> 29:39.970]  Topps, Chrome, All-American, McDonald's, All-American basketball cards.
[29:40.070 --> 29:42.750]  Now, these shouldn't be worth anything.
[29:42.970 --> 29:45.970]  These are just high school players, mostly, or people headed for college that are on the
[29:45.970 --> 29:46.750]  Topps All-American team.
[29:47.710 --> 29:54.510]  But this series has little Bronny James in it.
[29:55.010 --> 29:58.290]  And so some of his autos are going for like, you know, $1,200, $1,500.
[29:58.870 --> 30:00.190]  That always pans out too.
[30:00.250 --> 30:01.610]  Michael Jordan's kid is really torn up in the league.
[30:01.610 --> 30:03.250]  Yeah, Scottie Pippen Jr. is in the league right now.
[30:03.570 --> 30:05.490]  Michael Jordan's kid is also dating Larsa Pippen.
[30:06.270 --> 30:06.870]  That's true.
[30:07.030 --> 30:07.950]  They have a podcast, yeah?
[30:09.050 --> 30:10.690]  All housewives do, I think.
[30:10.870 --> 30:11.730]  Oh, she has a podcast.
[30:11.730 --> 30:11.910]  It's a requirement.
[30:12.230 --> 30:14.350]  Larsa Pippen is the Real Housewife of Miami.
[30:14.570 --> 30:16.290]  Oh, I think that they have a podcast.
[30:16.610 --> 30:17.330]  I think so too.
[30:17.350 --> 30:18.630]  I think that they like...
[30:18.630 --> 30:19.770]  Who doesn't have a podcast?
[30:21.190 --> 30:23.190]  I think it's like their name is like Jordan Pippen.
[30:23.390 --> 30:25.890]  And you're like, oh, this is not the Jordan Pippen I thought.
[30:26.010 --> 30:28.010]  Lee Shefford and then Kwame Evans.
[30:28.150 --> 30:29.350]  It's like, oh, they have a podcast.
[30:29.510 --> 30:30.390]  And you go, oh, just one?
[30:30.650 --> 30:30.810]  Yeah.
[30:33.010 --> 30:34.850]  Now it's like, how many podcasts do you have?
[30:34.870 --> 30:37.670]  How come he doesn't have three and he says, oh, I don't have any time.
[30:37.730 --> 30:38.750]  I have to do all these podcasts.
[30:39.430 --> 30:40.370]  That's Eric's doing me.
[30:40.730 --> 30:41.070]  That's you.
[30:43.470 --> 30:44.270]  Sahara Williams.
[30:45.330 --> 30:46.130]  Matas Bouzelis.
[30:47.730 --> 30:48.530]  Ashlyn Shade.
[30:48.650 --> 30:49.750]  So these are high schoolers.
[30:49.770 --> 30:50.070]  Jordan Donovan.
[30:50.610 --> 30:51.670]  High school or college?
[30:51.670 --> 30:55.170]  It's a bunch of people that aren't going to make the league because the Euro kids are coming, baby.
[30:55.650 --> 30:55.970]  Yeah.
[30:57.930 --> 30:58.730]  Riley Nelson.
[30:59.550 --> 31:00.350]  Andy Brown.
[31:00.970 --> 31:03.150]  Here's a silver Matas Bouzelis.
[31:03.610 --> 31:04.870]  Why aren't there any McDonald's cards?
[31:04.950 --> 31:06.290]  Like, give me the little nuggets.
[31:06.530 --> 31:07.390]  Yeah, give me the hamburger.
[31:07.510 --> 31:08.310]  Give me Grimace.
[31:08.510 --> 31:09.650]  I need like a Grimace parallel.
[31:11.150 --> 31:12.450]  Grimace on card auto.
[31:13.110 --> 31:13.750]  Marco Jackson.
[31:13.950 --> 31:14.610]  Reed Shepard.
[31:14.730 --> 31:17.530]  Well, maybe we'll get a, maybe we'll get a fancy...
[31:17.530 --> 31:19.090]  I like the little fry guys.
[31:19.630 --> 31:20.450]  Oh, the fry guys.
[31:20.630 --> 31:21.170]  They're pretty cool.
[31:21.270 --> 31:22.510]  DJ Wagner, Isaiah Collier.
[31:22.810 --> 31:23.390]  Those were MVP.
[31:23.650 --> 31:24.250]  They're co-MVPs.
[31:24.690 --> 31:27.750]  Here's Ashlyn Shade and a little, I don't know what kind of parallel.
[31:27.950 --> 31:28.110]  Wave?
[31:28.830 --> 31:29.030]  Yeah.
[31:29.890 --> 31:30.590]  Maybe that's a wave.
[31:30.750 --> 31:30.910]  I don't know.
[31:31.150 --> 31:32.570]  I'm not up to speed on tops parallel.
[31:32.930 --> 31:33.950]  Or high school kids.
[31:35.850 --> 31:37.430]  Both are fine to not be up to speed on.
[31:37.510 --> 31:37.970]  Oh, here we go.
[31:37.970 --> 31:38.710]  Bronny James.
[31:39.310 --> 31:40.130]  That's what we wanted.
[31:40.770 --> 31:41.370]  Bass Bronny.
[31:41.410 --> 31:42.150]  Bass Bronny.
[31:42.630 --> 31:43.830]  Jeremy Payne.
[31:44.070 --> 31:45.290]  Bass Fall.
[31:46.070 --> 31:47.790]  This wouldn't have any Wembees.
[31:48.230 --> 31:49.310]  No, just Bronnies.
[31:49.450 --> 31:50.330]  And we're going to go through it fast.
[31:50.390 --> 31:51.770]  I don't want to make fun of any high school kids.
[31:52.050 --> 31:52.570]  No, they're fine.
[31:53.010 --> 31:53.810]  They're all awesome.
[31:54.210 --> 31:55.090]  Riley Nelson.
[31:55.430 --> 31:55.930]  Tessa Johnson.
[31:56.110 --> 31:56.990]  Ooh, Essence Cody.
[31:57.150 --> 31:58.070]  Pink parallel.
[31:58.510 --> 31:58.950]  That's cool.
[31:59.510 --> 32:02.410]  I'm sure some of these, she might be in the, that's number to 150.
[32:02.610 --> 32:03.690]  She might be in the WNBA someday.
[32:04.110 --> 32:05.030]  Kwame Evans.
[32:05.910 --> 32:06.750]  Basketball is in.
[32:06.750 --> 32:08.170]  Bronny James's bloodline.
[32:08.530 --> 32:12.010]  He's a son of pro superstar LeBron James.
[32:12.310 --> 32:13.110]  I think I'm saying that right.
[32:13.310 --> 32:13.730]  LeBron James.
[32:13.830 --> 32:13.950]  Yep.
[32:14.410 --> 32:16.970]  A consensus four star recruit.
[32:17.290 --> 32:20.170]  His stock has skyrocketed as he has grown in stature.
[32:21.330 --> 32:22.510]  Sturdy and athletic.
[32:22.810 --> 32:26.370]  James is a tough, that's a lot of just explaining a high schooler's body.
[32:26.570 --> 32:26.670]  Right.
[32:26.730 --> 32:30.430]  It's also just making a lot of excuses while he'd be drafted high when his dad is LeBron James.
[32:30.450 --> 32:30.690]  Yeah.
[32:30.790 --> 32:35.690]  He has excelled as a combo guard, but his playmaking ability might translate best to the point.
[32:36.130 --> 32:40.010]  I hope he, does he just end up at like 6'2 and he doesn't make the league or what?
[32:40.170 --> 32:41.790]  His little brother's like way bigger too.
[32:41.850 --> 32:42.050]  Really?
[32:42.270 --> 32:42.470]  Yeah.
[32:42.810 --> 32:43.310]  Does he play?
[32:43.790 --> 32:44.010]  Yeah.
[32:44.710 --> 32:47.550]  You gotta be 6'6 and be able to shoot from beyond the arc.
[32:47.690 --> 32:49.370]  I don't know what, that's the league now.
[32:49.390 --> 32:50.210]  He's 6'3.
[32:50.770 --> 32:51.950]  Yeah, he's undersized.
[32:52.110 --> 32:53.510]  All right, we have this box of Obsidian.
[32:54.070 --> 32:54.310]  Ooh.
[32:54.590 --> 32:57.470]  I bought this, I bought a bunch of cards on a Black Friday sale.
[32:57.670 --> 32:57.850]  Okay.
[32:57.870 --> 33:00.510]  So a lot of this stuff is just like, shit I got cheap on Black Friday.
[33:00.570 --> 33:01.470]  So let's see what we get out of this.
[33:01.630 --> 33:01.950]  What are you looking for?
[33:01.950 --> 33:02.850]  One pack of Obsidian.
[33:02.950 --> 33:04.450]  Whoa, you only get one pack?
[33:04.450 --> 33:06.350]  I don't even know, I don't even remember what I paid for this.
[33:06.530 --> 33:07.210]  What year is this?
[33:09.810 --> 33:12.190]  Uh, 21, 22, so the last two years ago.
[33:12.190 --> 33:14.210]  So that would have been like Zion's year?
[33:15.070 --> 33:15.870]  Uh, maybe.
[33:16.370 --> 33:16.830]  Let's see.
[33:17.130 --> 33:19.390]  We have Andrew Wiggins.
[33:19.430 --> 33:19.710]  Okay.
[33:20.590 --> 33:21.390]  Disco Parallel.
[33:22.190 --> 33:22.990]  That's nice.
[33:23.250 --> 33:23.650]  Yeah.
[33:23.990 --> 33:26.130]  We have Jalen Johnson.
[33:26.670 --> 33:28.410]  Ooh, are they all shimmery?
[33:28.430 --> 33:29.610]  We have Gary Trent Jr.
[33:29.750 --> 33:29.890]  Oh, they're all thick.
[33:30.310 --> 33:31.350]  Oh, this is cool.
[33:31.470 --> 33:32.310]  Yeah, they're all thick.
[33:32.310 --> 33:36.030]  We have a Red Parallel, Zach LaVine.
[33:36.370 --> 33:37.710]  He'll probably be a Bull.
[33:37.970 --> 33:38.610]  That's Alex Caruso.
[33:39.410 --> 33:40.270]  I'm sorry, I said Alex Caruso.
[33:40.710 --> 33:41.510]  Zach LaVine's coming up.
[33:41.950 --> 33:44.150]  Uh, Alex Caruso, he'll probably be a Laker.
[33:44.370 --> 33:45.390]  That's AC Fresh, baby!
[33:45.830 --> 33:46.010]  Bring it back!
[33:46.010 --> 33:47.170]  Next up, Zach LaVine.
[33:47.330 --> 33:47.910]  See, I told you.
[33:48.050 --> 33:49.510]  I was looking at Zach LaVine when I put that.
[33:49.730 --> 33:51.050]  Well, they're on the same team.
[33:51.210 --> 33:51.910]  Oh, shit, guys.
[33:52.130 --> 33:54.110]  This one's numbered 10 of 10.
[33:54.370 --> 33:54.730]  Ooh!
[33:55.050 --> 33:56.730]  That's probably worth a lot of money, actually.
[33:56.750 --> 33:57.570]  What's the red one numbered to?
[33:57.570 --> 33:57.910]  Let's save it.
[33:58.330 --> 33:59.450]  Yeah, let's save that.
[34:00.470 --> 34:01.450]  And then, uh...
[34:02.130 --> 34:03.490]  Oh, like a thick sleeve?
[34:03.590 --> 34:04.210]  I would think so.
[34:04.250 --> 34:05.610]  Chris Paul...
[34:07.050 --> 34:07.370]  CP3?
[34:07.950 --> 34:08.870]  He has the vision.
[34:11.010 --> 34:11.930]  Uh, not numbered.
[34:12.190 --> 34:12.430]  Interesting.
[34:12.650 --> 34:13.370]  Oh, there you go.
[34:13.630 --> 34:14.770]  Do you want it in a thick boy?
[34:14.870 --> 34:15.570]  Go ahead and sleeve all this.
[34:16.550 --> 34:17.790]  Uh, you can just...
[34:17.790 --> 34:19.770]  Yeah, put that one in a...
[34:19.770 --> 34:21.190]  Should I double sleeve it?
[34:21.350 --> 34:21.750]  No, no.
[34:21.890 --> 34:23.050]  Well, you put it in a top layer, yeah.
[34:23.970 --> 34:25.630]  But I'd keep it in this guy too?
[34:26.190 --> 34:26.490]  Yeah.
[34:27.470 --> 34:28.050]  Just like that.
[34:28.050 --> 34:28.930]  Like how...
[34:30.250 --> 34:30.570]  Like...
[34:31.850 --> 34:33.690]  Not like that, but like that, but like that.
[34:34.370 --> 34:34.670]  I'm excited.
[34:34.810 --> 34:36.070]  AC Fresh coming back to LA.
[34:37.370 --> 34:38.590]  That's their missing piece, Geoff.
[34:38.870 --> 34:39.110]  Oh.
[34:39.270 --> 34:39.470]  Who?
[34:39.750 --> 34:40.170]  There you go.
[34:40.450 --> 34:40.970]  Alex Caruso.
[34:41.150 --> 34:41.270]  Yeah.
[34:41.810 --> 34:42.290]  We'll see.
[34:42.370 --> 34:42.930]  We'll see if he does.
[34:43.370 --> 34:45.770]  There's a lot of rumors that Zac Elyseum could be...
[34:45.770 --> 34:46.070]  Yeah.
[34:46.490 --> 34:47.850]  Which is weird, because it's like, you got rid of him.
[34:47.930 --> 34:48.270]  You didn't want him.
[34:48.270 --> 34:49.570]  Yeah, you didn't want him.
[34:49.650 --> 34:51.330]  So I don't know why you...
[34:51.330 --> 34:51.970]  But that's...
[34:51.970 --> 34:52.610]  Boy, that's LA, huh?
[34:52.710 --> 34:53.210]  Hindsight, huh?
[34:53.770 --> 34:55.070]  Uh, Game of Thrones.
[34:55.670 --> 34:56.010]  Fuck it.
[34:56.010 --> 34:56.190]  All right.
[34:56.190 --> 34:57.410]  Let's open up some season six.
[34:57.470 --> 34:57.710]  Great.
[34:59.190 --> 35:00.070]  Daenerys Targaryen.
[35:00.090 --> 35:00.570]  Oh, shit.
[35:00.830 --> 35:01.550]  Oh, shit.
[35:01.830 --> 35:02.550]  Oh, shit.
[35:02.570 --> 35:02.970]  What do we got?
[35:02.970 --> 35:03.430]  What do we get?
[35:03.550 --> 35:04.250]  What is it?
[35:04.370 --> 35:05.030]  Is it good?
[35:05.210 --> 35:05.390]  Yeah.
[35:05.610 --> 35:06.110]  We got a real...
[35:06.110 --> 35:06.810]  What do we got?
[35:06.890 --> 35:07.670]  We got a real one?
[35:08.250 --> 35:09.570]  We got a...
[35:10.190 --> 35:12.210]  Here's a picture of...
[35:12.210 --> 35:12.950]  Looks like Arya.
[35:13.110 --> 35:13.350]  Okay.
[35:13.630 --> 35:14.790]  That does look like Arya.
[35:14.810 --> 35:15.950]  That's just a face person.
[35:16.210 --> 35:17.850]  Grand Master Pycelle.
[35:18.150 --> 35:18.490]  Cool.
[35:18.870 --> 35:20.430]  We have Walder Frey.
[35:21.030 --> 35:24.370]  And then we have an on-car auto from Natalie Dormer.
[35:24.370 --> 35:24.770]  Whoa!
[35:25.690 --> 35:26.090]  Wow!
[35:27.090 --> 35:28.390]  Dude, that's fucking cool.
[35:28.490 --> 35:30.650]  Natalie Dormer's in a lot of stuff.
[35:30.750 --> 35:31.070]  Wow.
[35:31.630 --> 35:33.290]  She's like a real actress.
[35:33.770 --> 35:43.010]  She was in the TV version of that Australian movie Peter Weir did in the 70s, Murder...
[35:43.010 --> 35:43.830]  Picnic at Hanging Rock.
[35:44.110 --> 35:45.550]  They made a TV series and it wasn't very good.
[35:46.170 --> 35:47.050]  You know that movie?
[35:47.490 --> 35:48.190]  Picnic at Hanging Rock?
[35:48.230 --> 35:48.630]  You ever seen it?
[35:49.050 --> 35:49.830]  Awesome film.
[35:50.170 --> 35:50.690]  It's Australian?
[35:51.030 --> 35:51.270]  Yeah.
[35:51.410 --> 35:52.670]  It's a bunch of girls go...
[35:52.670 --> 35:54.070]  It's supposed to be based on a true story, but it's not.
[35:54.070 --> 35:55.910]  But it says it is, so you think it's real.
[35:56.030 --> 35:56.670]  Kind of like Blair Witch.
[35:57.050 --> 36:02.710]  A bunch of girls go for a picnic from a girl's school and then only one of them comes home.
[36:02.870 --> 36:03.250]  Fun.
[36:03.410 --> 36:03.810]  Let's watch it.
[36:03.870 --> 36:05.970]  And the whole movie is about what happened to the other girl.
[36:06.670 --> 36:06.950]  Dang.
[36:08.130 --> 36:08.950]  It's like Yellowjacket.
[36:08.970 --> 36:09.830]  Cersei Lannister.
[36:10.170 --> 36:10.810]  Yeah, kind of.
[36:12.670 --> 36:13.090]  Dragons.
[36:16.190 --> 36:17.030]  Samwell Tarly.
[36:18.570 --> 36:20.050]  The Book of the Stranger.
[36:20.530 --> 36:21.080]  And then Bronn.
[36:22.010 --> 36:22.430]  Bronn.
[36:22.430 --> 36:23.430]  Who apparently...
[36:24.030 --> 36:27.010]  Was somebody just telling us that Bronn and Cersei hated each other?
[36:27.270 --> 36:28.970]  They dated for a really long time.
[36:29.170 --> 36:29.390]  Yeah.
[36:29.590 --> 36:30.250]  Like in real...
[36:30.250 --> 36:30.750]  Like the actors.
[36:31.030 --> 36:32.210]  Dated for like a really long time.
[36:32.470 --> 36:33.830]  And then...
[36:33.830 --> 36:35.070]  They didn't have any...
[36:35.070 --> 36:35.870]  They didn't really have any...
[36:35.870 --> 36:36.510]  They didn't have any sex together.
[36:36.770 --> 36:36.790]  Yeah.
[36:38.310 --> 36:39.850]  Oh, we're going to the castle.
[36:40.010 --> 36:41.450]  Oh, I'm going to stay in the city.
[36:41.570 --> 36:42.090]  Oh, you don't say.
[36:42.330 --> 36:43.090]  Here we go.
[36:43.390 --> 36:44.570]  This is last year's Prism.
[36:45.350 --> 36:45.490]  Cool.
[36:45.810 --> 36:46.630]  Delon Wright.
[36:48.050 --> 36:48.850]  Draymond Green.
[36:49.130 --> 36:49.450]  Yeah!
[36:49.630 --> 36:50.490]  That's my guy right now.
[36:50.790 --> 36:51.670]  Stefan Marbury.
[36:51.670 --> 36:52.330]  He's great.
[36:52.410 --> 36:54.230]  He does like a Rowdy Roddy Piper sleeper.
[36:54.470 --> 36:56.510]  NBA 75th edition.
[36:56.690 --> 36:57.490]  Patti Mills parallel.
[36:57.590 --> 37:00.210]  Patti Mills is DNPing all season right now.
[37:00.270 --> 37:00.790]  I think I'm a hawk.
[37:00.890 --> 37:01.590]  What's that mean?
[37:01.890 --> 37:02.510]  Do not play.
[37:02.750 --> 37:02.950]  Why?
[37:03.230 --> 37:03.890]  No idea.
[37:03.970 --> 37:04.490]  He's a good player.
[37:04.910 --> 37:05.770]  Like they...
[37:05.770 --> 37:08.050]  Like he benched himself or they benched him?
[37:08.050 --> 37:08.670]  No, they've benched him.
[37:09.430 --> 37:10.190]  Don't really...
[37:10.190 --> 37:11.390]  I haven't really heard why or what's going on.
[37:11.390 --> 37:11.990]  Yeah, same.
[37:13.110 --> 37:13.550]  Uh...
[37:13.550 --> 37:13.830]  What do we got?
[37:13.990 --> 37:18.410]  I found this pack of Skybox inaugural edition NBA trading cards.
[37:19.150 --> 37:19.590]  Skybox?
[37:19.670 --> 37:20.670]  Gotta be like...
[37:20.670 --> 37:21.470]  1990?
[37:22.610 --> 37:22.870]  1991 maybe?
[37:23.130 --> 37:24.050]  They look like...
[37:24.050 --> 37:25.110]  Like the cover was like...
[37:25.110 --> 37:26.190]  The sleeve was like old.
[37:26.530 --> 37:27.430]  Tom Tolbert.
[37:27.610 --> 37:29.410]  Ooh, Celtics great Robert Parrish.
[37:29.550 --> 37:30.310]  Save that please.
[37:30.990 --> 37:31.770]  Ed Neely.
[37:32.450 --> 37:33.930]  Is that the guy from...
[37:33.930 --> 37:34.570]  The Man with Children?
[37:35.010 --> 37:35.330]  Yeah.
[37:35.330 --> 37:35.470]  Yeah.
[37:36.770 --> 37:37.810]  Sam Mitchell.
[37:38.670 --> 37:39.710]  Greg Kite.
[37:39.990 --> 37:42.830]  Ooh, Danny Ferry was supposed to be a much bigger deal than he was.
[37:43.370 --> 37:44.910]  Rory Sparrow.
[37:46.030 --> 37:47.070]  Dwayne Farrell.
[37:47.310 --> 37:47.550]  That's cool.
[37:47.650 --> 37:48.790]  John Sally card.
[37:49.050 --> 37:49.750]  Oh, that's cool.
[37:49.750 --> 37:50.690]  That is a cool card.
[37:50.810 --> 37:51.610]  Kevin Johnson.
[37:52.630 --> 37:52.930]  Wow.
[37:53.570 --> 37:54.290]  Gerald Henderson.
[37:54.470 --> 37:58.110]  I don't love all these cards, but some of them with the backgrounds are cool.
[37:58.250 --> 37:59.230]  Some of them like that suck.
[37:59.550 --> 38:00.190]  Ron Harper.
[38:00.490 --> 38:01.350]  And here's one for me.
[38:01.610 --> 38:01.750]  That was not bad.
[38:01.850 --> 38:02.290]  And only me.
[38:02.390 --> 38:02.710]  Last one.
[38:03.390 --> 38:04.110]  Dennis Johnson.
[38:04.290 --> 38:04.650]  Boston.
[38:04.710 --> 38:05.150]  Oh, yeah.
[38:05.250 --> 38:05.450]  Hell yeah.
[38:05.770 --> 38:06.330]  Dennis Johnson.
[38:06.450 --> 38:08.210]  My first favorite basketball player.
[38:08.450 --> 38:09.570]  Died in Austin.
[38:09.950 --> 38:10.150]  Yeah.
[38:10.330 --> 38:11.770]  Oh, on 22-22, right?
[38:12.090 --> 38:12.530]  On a car wreck?
[38:12.830 --> 38:13.650]  No, he died...
[38:13.650 --> 38:14.990]  No, he was...
[38:14.990 --> 38:15.930]  I think he had a heart attack.
[38:16.070 --> 38:18.670]  But he was a coach of the minor league team.
[38:18.670 --> 38:22.070]  He died outside of the convention center.
[38:22.210 --> 38:26.790]  We did an episode of Face Jam where I think we talked about him.
[38:27.010 --> 38:27.770]  Oh, wow.
[38:27.990 --> 38:29.210]  He's a coach of the minor league team.
[38:29.630 --> 38:30.950]  And he had ownership...
[38:30.950 --> 38:33.230]  Boy, I want to say it was Taco Cabana, maybe?
[38:33.590 --> 38:34.790]  That's what Geoff had for lunch today.
[38:34.930 --> 38:35.890]  Geoff, you're gonna die!
[38:36.130 --> 38:36.670]  Oh, no.
[38:37.890 --> 38:38.790]  What'd you get at Taco Cabana?
[38:40.510 --> 38:41.210]  Mexican plate.
[38:41.610 --> 38:43.810]  I thought maybe you got the limited time stuff.
[38:44.130 --> 38:45.390]  No, I get the same.
[38:45.970 --> 38:47.770]  I get the same thing every time, dude.
[38:48.270 --> 38:50.510]  What's the special at Taco Cabana right now?
[38:50.730 --> 38:52.870]  Chili cheese quesadilla or something like that?
[38:52.870 --> 38:53.330]  I saw that, yeah.
[38:53.910 --> 38:57.890]  We were just looking up the Taco Bell Chili Cheese Burrito map the other day.
[38:58.410 --> 39:00.370]  Lisa Leslie. We're doing it up in WNBA.
[39:01.010 --> 39:02.070]  These cards are cool.
[39:02.210 --> 39:02.770]  Stephanie Talbott.
[39:03.570 --> 39:05.050]  She points, she's going, look at that.
[39:05.430 --> 39:06.850]  Lexi Hill, rookie.
[39:07.050 --> 39:07.610]  Look at the little mouse.
[39:07.750 --> 39:08.670]  Leave that, please.
[39:08.890 --> 39:09.370]  Yes, sir.
[39:09.470 --> 39:12.350]  A star parallel Nia Coffey.
[39:12.450 --> 39:15.870]  If you ever want to tell what the parallels are, you can see this has stars on it, right?
[39:15.970 --> 39:16.130]  Yeah.
[39:16.130 --> 39:18.890]  But they always put them right here on the back.
[39:18.990 --> 39:19.310]  It says Astro.
[39:19.870 --> 39:19.990]  Astro.
[39:20.130 --> 39:21.410]  So like a base won't have that.
[39:21.830 --> 39:22.250]  Right.
[39:22.990 --> 39:26.590]  And so Revolution's nice because they tell you what the parallel is because it's confusing.
[39:27.310 --> 39:29.370]  And then Sylvia Fowles, that's cool.
[39:29.690 --> 39:30.030]  Cool.
[39:30.410 --> 39:30.930]  Cool.
[39:31.310 --> 39:35.710]  Now we'll open up this pack of Mosaic from last year.
[39:35.810 --> 39:36.130]  NBA.
[39:36.510 --> 39:36.870]  That's fun.
[39:37.970 --> 39:40.650]  From last year, what was the hot shit?
[39:41.090 --> 39:43.130]  Last year would have been Paulo Banqueiro.
[39:43.530 --> 39:44.130]  Kate Cunningham?
[39:44.670 --> 39:46.410]  Yeah, there's my guy.
[39:46.550 --> 39:50.390]  So you're telling me Kyrie Irving has a lot to say and you like it?
[39:51.170 --> 39:51.850]  He likes it.
[39:52.190 --> 39:53.290]  Kyrie Irving and Pat Beverly.
[39:53.470 --> 39:55.330]  Two dudes that everybody wants on their team.
[39:55.550 --> 39:56.070]  That's cool.
[39:56.390 --> 39:59.170]  I will say, Pat Bev is on the Bulls now?
[39:59.930 --> 40:00.990]  Or he's on the Pistons?
[40:01.910 --> 40:03.710]  I don't remember him on the Bulls?
[40:04.350 --> 40:05.450]  Who is he on right now?
[40:05.650 --> 40:06.770]  He's on the 76ers.
[40:06.770 --> 40:07.510]  He's on the Sixers.
[40:07.670 --> 40:07.830]  Yeah.
[40:08.010 --> 40:09.110]  So I don't remember him.
[40:09.250 --> 40:10.310]  Was he on the Bulls last year?
[40:10.650 --> 40:11.310]  He might have been.
[40:11.330 --> 40:12.310]  I don't remember that.
[40:12.450 --> 40:13.750]  I don't remember that at all.
[40:13.750 --> 40:14.530]  Cole Anthony?
[40:14.870 --> 40:17.010]  Did you see the video of the number one Pat Bev fan?
[40:17.190 --> 40:18.610]  And he wore all the Pat Bev jerseys.
[40:19.010 --> 40:21.530]  He signed the top one and then the guy pulls it up and it's another one.
[40:21.810 --> 40:22.850]  He signs the next one.
[40:23.050 --> 40:23.590]  He does it.
[40:23.650 --> 40:24.330]  He's like six of them.
[40:24.650 --> 40:26.070]  It's like six Pat Bev jerseys on.
[40:26.210 --> 40:26.790]  It was so cool.
[40:26.990 --> 40:27.670]  This is awesome.
[40:27.990 --> 40:29.170]  We got a Jalen Williams.
[40:29.190 --> 40:29.750]  Oh, nice.
[40:31.390 --> 40:31.750]  Sparkle.
[40:31.850 --> 40:32.610]  Sparkle Paralympics.
[40:32.810 --> 40:33.490]  We'll just leave it at that.
[40:33.530 --> 40:35.470]  We got a base, Paulo Banqueiro, Rookie of the Year.
[40:36.170 --> 40:37.330]  Jake LaRavia, base.
[40:37.750 --> 40:39.810]  And Ricky and a Jeremy Shoshan rookie.
[40:40.350 --> 40:42.990]  They are trying to make that guy a point forward for some reason.
[40:43.390 --> 40:43.750]  Shoshan?
[40:44.390 --> 40:45.090]  Yeah, Shoshan.
[40:45.210 --> 40:45.770]  What's his deal?
[40:47.170 --> 40:50.190]  He's just like a young promising player on the Spurs.
[40:50.750 --> 40:52.150]  They don't have a real point, aren't they?
[40:52.730 --> 40:55.210]  They're missing a lot of pieces, but they're in there.
[40:55.430 --> 40:57.690]  Like, we got Wemby and now we're going to build around this guy thing.
[40:57.730 --> 41:01.330]  So we'll see who can stand up with him and then who doesn't.
[41:01.450 --> 41:03.490]  And we get rid of who doesn't and we get the guys.
[41:03.650 --> 41:07.650]  A lot of our Spurs games are blacked out and we don't have the local stuff.
[41:07.750 --> 41:10.170]  And so, how is he playing?
[41:10.170 --> 41:12.650]  We also can't watch Spurs games because we're local.
[41:12.650 --> 41:14.170]  We need to get some rabbit ears.
[41:14.210 --> 41:15.110]  This is baseball bullshit.
[41:15.390 --> 41:18.890]  You know, Wemby isn't having the insane year that people are going like,
[41:18.910 --> 41:20.570]  he's going to have 100 blocks, whatever.
[41:21.150 --> 41:23.110]  It's just not him, but it's great.
[41:23.230 --> 41:24.850]  And then Greg Popovich grabs the microphone and he says,
[41:24.910 --> 41:28.490]  Stop booing for Kawhi Leonard, my handsome son.
[41:28.490 --> 41:29.150]  Did he say that?
[41:30.390 --> 41:31.790]  Kawhi Leonard was shooting free throws.
[41:32.010 --> 41:32.690]  He chastised the audience.
[41:32.950 --> 41:36.350]  And the crowd was booing Kawhi Leonard because he fucked the Spurs.
[41:36.590 --> 41:40.090]  And then they booed him so much that Popovich grabbed the microphone
[41:40.090 --> 41:42.310]  and he went, Hey, this isn't who we are.
[41:42.490 --> 41:43.290]  Stop booing him.
[41:43.530 --> 41:44.570]  Never seen that in my life.
[41:44.730 --> 41:47.370]  And then he put the microphone back and the crowd went,
[41:48.510 --> 41:48.710]  Boo!
[41:49.770 --> 41:50.330]  It was great.
[41:50.610 --> 41:51.790]  That's who San Antonio is.
[41:52.130 --> 41:58.850]  Kodai Senga, Jake Alou, and a Jared Schuster pink parallel.
[41:59.010 --> 42:00.670]  Pink refractor, I believe it's called.
[42:01.450 --> 42:02.870]  So let's sleeve these three.
[42:03.710 --> 42:04.150]  Okay.
[42:04.430 --> 42:05.430]  Still on Otani watch.
[42:06.350 --> 42:08.550]  Don't know where he's going yet, but I saw an article.
[42:09.230 --> 42:10.050]  Oh, really?
[42:10.310 --> 42:10.530]  No.
[42:10.950 --> 42:15.010]  Saw an article today that was some sports writer going,
[42:15.310 --> 42:17.750]  The secrecy around Shohei Otani is bad for the sport.
[42:17.870 --> 42:20.490]  And really, it's just bad for writers because they don't have any new information.
[42:21.130 --> 42:22.410]  And they're going, Oh, what is he going to do?
[42:23.150 --> 42:27.390]  Somebody said he should do what LeBron James did and go on ESPN and make his decision.
[42:27.510 --> 42:29.230]  And it's like, you're a fucking moron.
[42:29.370 --> 42:30.610]  No more of that, please.
[42:30.830 --> 42:31.030]  Great.
[42:32.310 --> 42:33.010]  What do we got here?
[42:33.070 --> 42:36.430]  Oh, Gunnar Henderson, throwback rookie, 35th anniversary.
[42:37.010 --> 42:37.330]  Orioles?
[42:37.430 --> 42:38.950]  Do you want him to go to the Padres?
[42:40.170 --> 42:41.770]  No, I think we're fine.
[42:41.890 --> 42:43.950]  Look at this gorgeous Freddie Freeman card.
[42:44.230 --> 42:44.930]  You like him, right?
[42:45.430 --> 42:45.710]  No.
[42:45.990 --> 42:46.250]  Eric?
[42:46.830 --> 42:48.430]  When he's on the Braves, get him back over there.
[42:48.990 --> 42:49.630]  Teoscar Hernandez.
[42:50.110 --> 42:50.430]  I think he...
[42:51.230 --> 42:51.770]  You know what?
[42:51.790 --> 42:52.790]  I don't think he wants to go back now.
[42:52.850 --> 42:54.230]  I think he and Mookie, they're like buddies.
[42:54.470 --> 42:55.270]  I think so too.
[42:55.390 --> 43:00.210]  I think he was really hurt by the Braves organization not reaching out and all that stuff.
[43:00.310 --> 43:01.710]  I think that really fucked him up.
[43:01.710 --> 43:03.130]  Michael Harris, rookie cup.
[43:03.510 --> 43:04.950]  Luis Guillaume.
[43:05.330 --> 43:06.270]  Iroi Perez.
[43:06.830 --> 43:07.150]  Ooh.
[43:07.530 --> 43:10.430]  Eric, if you could choose that we have a pro football team...
[43:10.430 --> 43:11.470]  Owen Miller.
[43:11.770 --> 43:13.090]  Pro sport team in Austin.
[43:13.390 --> 43:13.470]  Yeah.
[43:13.650 --> 43:17.970]  Would you rather we have an NBA team, a baseball team, or a football team?
[43:19.130 --> 43:20.710]  I know your answer is NBA.
[43:21.770 --> 43:22.510]  I assume.
[43:22.790 --> 43:25.830]  I would probably go pro football just because I don't have a team.
[43:26.030 --> 43:26.210]  Yeah.
[43:26.350 --> 43:27.050]  Ooh, Raphael Devers.
[43:27.050 --> 43:31.010]  The only team that I watch is the Chargers and just hope they lose every week.
[43:31.010 --> 43:32.390]  You watch out of spite.
[43:32.570 --> 43:33.190]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[43:33.370 --> 43:34.210]  I hate watching the Chargers.
[43:34.370 --> 43:34.730]  It's great.
[43:35.370 --> 43:36.270]  Ooh, Jose Hernandez.
[43:36.690 --> 43:37.130]  Pink rookie.
[43:37.250 --> 43:37.730]  That's nice.
[43:37.930 --> 43:38.990]  Yeah, I'd say football team.
[43:39.050 --> 43:40.030]  If we got a football team, that would be cool.
[43:40.150 --> 43:40.770]  It's never going to happen.
[43:40.890 --> 43:41.890]  Jerry Jones will never let a team move into Texas.
[43:42.090 --> 43:43.070]  Jerry Jones or UT.
[43:43.610 --> 43:46.430]  They will never let another team move into Texas.
[43:46.630 --> 43:47.730]  Garrett Mitchell, rookie.
[43:47.930 --> 43:48.650]  That's nice.
[43:50.010 --> 43:51.250]  Brett Beatty, throwback.
[43:51.290 --> 43:52.030]  That's a pretty card.
[43:52.650 --> 43:53.810]  Ooh, Titans.
[43:54.130 --> 43:55.170]  Anthony Volpe, rookie.
[43:55.370 --> 43:55.690]  Dang.
[43:56.290 --> 43:57.090]  He's huge.
[43:57.590 --> 43:59.150]  He's showing that booty too.
[43:59.150 --> 44:01.350]  He looks like he's about to take a dump all over that audience.
[44:01.610 --> 44:02.470]  Riley Greene.
[44:04.070 --> 44:04.930]  It doesn't matter.
[44:05.050 --> 44:10.290]  We have college football in the college football playoffs, which is just as good and sound.
[44:10.530 --> 44:14.050]  Yeah, congratulations to the University of Alabama and the University of Texas.
[44:14.710 --> 44:15.750]  Everybody's really happy.
[44:16.410 --> 44:17.030]  Hell yeah.
[44:18.330 --> 44:20.230]  Yeah, University of Alabama, congratulations.
[44:20.430 --> 44:21.390]  They really deserved it.
[44:21.610 --> 44:24.970]  Yeah, apparently FSU's cool with it.
[44:25.850 --> 44:26.890]  They're like, we get it.
[44:26.970 --> 44:28.790]  They said, hell yeah, no problem, Bama, get them.
[44:28.790 --> 44:29.310]  Yeah.
[44:29.430 --> 44:30.090]  Roll Tide.
[44:32.690 --> 44:33.170]  It's fine.
[44:33.290 --> 44:35.630]  They're moving to 12 teams in the tournament.
[44:36.010 --> 44:36.890]  Tanner Beebe, Devin Williams.
[44:37.110 --> 44:40.130]  If you can't make it in the 12-team tournament, don't worry about it.
[44:40.450 --> 44:42.070]  It's not meant for you.
[44:42.170 --> 44:42.470]  That's true.
[44:42.790 --> 44:43.750]  We gotta do our pick-ems.
[44:44.050 --> 44:46.290]  If you're the 13th team, it's not, you know...
[44:46.290 --> 44:47.730]  Ryan Mountcastle, future star.
[44:47.830 --> 44:48.510]  That's a pretty card.
[44:48.930 --> 44:50.070]  You probably want to hang on to that one.
[44:50.070 --> 44:52.530]  That's like a nebula.
[44:52.790 --> 44:53.690]  Yeah, it's a nebula.
[44:53.690 --> 44:54.330]  Hey!
[44:55.750 --> 44:58.130]  Michael Walker, comeback season last year.
[44:58.210 --> 44:59.470]  No one really believed in him.
[44:59.650 --> 45:00.790]  Had a great year.
[45:01.070 --> 45:03.370]  Really impressed with Michael Walker and everything he turned in for the...
[45:03.370 --> 45:04.870]  My San Diego Padres.
[45:05.070 --> 45:06.810]  I like that jersey in that picture.
[45:06.990 --> 45:07.510]  It was like...
[45:07.510 --> 45:11.210]  Yeah, that jersey, their City Connect has really, really grown on me.
[45:12.010 --> 45:13.810]  Let's open up a box of Allen and Jetski.
[45:14.090 --> 45:14.490]  Yay!
[45:14.930 --> 45:16.090]  See if we can get a rip.
[45:16.410 --> 45:16.890]  Let's do it.
[45:16.950 --> 45:19.050]  Did you see that my Jetski came back 10 out of 10?
[45:19.230 --> 45:19.690]  Did it really?
[45:19.750 --> 45:21.050]  Yeah, PSA 10 on the Jetski card.
[45:21.050 --> 45:21.190]  That's awesome.
[45:21.190 --> 45:25.610]  And when we were opening cards yesterday, I got one that was sun tanning.
[45:25.730 --> 45:26.590]  Oh, that's fun.
[45:26.630 --> 45:28.110]  Yeah, it's part of the fun in the sun season.
[45:28.270 --> 45:29.570]  What's the 10 out of 10 worth?
[45:30.930 --> 45:32.050]  It's the only one in the world.
[45:32.230 --> 45:34.650]  Yeah, so it's worth whatever I decided it is.
[45:34.650 --> 45:36.030]  So it's worth a dollar plus whatever we paid for that.
[45:36.310 --> 45:37.690]  I'm setting the price at $100.
[45:38.850 --> 45:41.590]  Congratulations, you got a top loader, box loader.
[45:41.610 --> 45:42.070]  Oh, we didn't get a rip.
[45:42.070 --> 45:43.730]  Oh, but it's a Julio Rodriguez, that's cool.
[45:44.910 --> 45:45.530]  A little J-Rod.
[45:45.650 --> 45:46.670]  I want more.
[45:46.790 --> 45:47.710]  I want rip cards.
[45:47.890 --> 45:49.510]  Well, there could be some rip cards in here, sweetie.
[45:49.530 --> 45:49.910]  Let's see.
[45:49.910 --> 45:51.190]  Yeah, sweetie, hang on.
[45:51.250 --> 45:51.930]  Yeah, sweetums.
[45:54.470 --> 45:55.830]  Am I getting shit on for being...
[45:55.830 --> 45:56.930]  No, you, no.
[45:57.070 --> 45:57.290]  Yes.
[45:57.490 --> 45:58.310]  Nice to my...
[45:58.310 --> 45:59.310]  Yep, don't do that.
[45:59.470 --> 45:59.850]  Wife.
[46:00.170 --> 46:01.470]  Stop being nice to your wife.
[46:02.190 --> 46:03.050]  Hello, mayor.
[46:03.330 --> 46:06.710]  Ooh, everybody loves Captain Sandy.
[46:07.290 --> 46:08.190]  Oh, we do.
[46:08.430 --> 46:09.350]  Wait, is that from Below Deck?
[46:09.350 --> 46:09.530]  From Below Deck?
[46:09.750 --> 46:10.610]  Hell yeah, it is.
[46:10.830 --> 46:11.770]  Why does it say Yawn?
[46:12.290 --> 46:12.710]  Yawn.
[46:12.810 --> 46:13.370]  That's her last name.
[46:13.790 --> 46:14.230]  Oh, is it?
[46:14.610 --> 46:19.050]  I should save this for Vanessa and Burn Dog loves...
[46:19.050 --> 46:19.410]  Oh, yeah?
[46:19.410 --> 46:20.070]  It's true, yeah.
[46:20.370 --> 46:21.690]  Mookie Betts, everybody loves him.
[46:21.850 --> 46:22.010]  Nope.
[46:24.350 --> 46:25.010]  Aaron Nola.
[46:25.510 --> 46:27.110]  Aaron Nola just re-signed with Philly.
[46:27.430 --> 46:28.270]  A lot of money.
[46:28.910 --> 46:30.110]  Boom, Snow Owl.
[46:30.490 --> 46:30.890]  Wow!
[46:31.410 --> 46:31.770]  Nice.
[46:31.910 --> 46:32.310]  Talented.
[46:33.010 --> 46:33.970]  That's what they call me.
[46:34.110 --> 46:35.450]  We're gonna collect all those talent.
[46:35.550 --> 46:35.670]  Wow.
[46:35.950 --> 46:39.650]  I've decided that Alan and Ginter is gonna be the first set we complete.
[46:40.430 --> 46:40.910]  I like it.
[46:41.310 --> 46:42.650]  Alan and Ginter and Dallas.
[46:42.870 --> 46:43.230]  They're gonna be...
[46:43.230 --> 46:43.610]  That's our...
[46:43.610 --> 46:44.310]  We're chasing those.
[46:44.390 --> 46:44.950]  I was on board.
[46:45.030 --> 46:45.430]  No, I'm not.
[46:45.590 --> 46:46.410]  And then I think...
[46:46.410 --> 46:48.370]  You weren't here when I was talking about last week.
[46:48.550 --> 46:50.470]  I think we should give a lot of these cards away.
[46:50.670 --> 46:53.030]  Like, when we complete a set, like, for 2023,
[46:53.850 --> 46:56.450]  like, the guys who look like accountants or whatever,
[46:56.810 --> 46:59.250]  we should compile it and then just give it away to the audience.
[46:59.650 --> 47:00.250]  Luis Robert.
[47:01.030 --> 47:01.330]  Boo Bob.
[47:01.730 --> 47:02.210]  Not a leader.
[47:02.610 --> 47:03.630]  Clayce, not a leader.
[47:04.050 --> 47:04.450]  Arias.
[47:05.190 --> 47:05.990]  Boba Shett.
[47:06.970 --> 47:07.610]  Boba Fett?
[47:08.690 --> 47:10.730]  Fred Curley, World 100 Meter Champion.
[47:11.750 --> 47:12.550]  Spencer Strider.
[47:15.770 --> 47:16.250]  Kenny...
[47:16.250 --> 47:17.290]  Kenny Lofton.
[47:17.390 --> 47:17.630]  Really?
[47:17.930 --> 47:18.390]  What team?
[47:18.870 --> 47:19.730]  For the Rangers?
[47:19.950 --> 47:22.950]  That Strider guy looks like our friend Eric Sanger.
[47:23.410 --> 47:24.190]  He does kind of, yeah.
[47:26.110 --> 47:26.590]  Bandoneon.
[47:27.110 --> 47:27.590]  Bandoneon.
[47:28.130 --> 47:28.610]  Bandoneon.
[47:28.970 --> 47:29.450]  Bandoneon.
[47:30.130 --> 47:32.990]  Spencer Strider has gigantic legs and a crazy ass.
[47:33.170 --> 47:34.010]  Ooh, you like that.
[47:34.150 --> 47:36.230]  Yeah, you know, it's a lot of power in a pitcher.
[47:36.510 --> 47:37.870]  It's Eric Stonestreet!
[47:38.070 --> 47:41.110]  Do you know what the craziest thing Eric Stonestreet's known for?
[47:41.110 --> 47:42.490]  Dating Charlize Theron.
[47:42.610 --> 47:44.070]  That motherfucker dated Charlize Theron.
[47:44.110 --> 47:44.530]  Did he really?
[47:44.910 --> 47:45.470]  I didn't know that.
[47:45.510 --> 47:46.390]  Yeah, they dated for a little while.
[47:46.430 --> 47:50.850]  I would say that he's friends with former UFC heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar.
[47:53.190 --> 47:54.390]  Well-rounded man.
[47:54.450 --> 47:54.990]  Yeah, no kidding.
[47:55.390 --> 47:56.330]  Gunner Henderson rookie.
[47:56.430 --> 47:57.290]  Another one, right?
[47:57.750 --> 47:59.090]  Joey Votto.
[47:59.490 --> 48:00.110]  Hey, he retired.
[48:00.110 --> 48:01.050]  Sterling Marte.
[48:03.130 --> 48:04.010]  Gorilla Nims.
[48:04.230 --> 48:04.770]  He's a rapper.
[48:05.130 --> 48:05.410]  Whoa.
[48:06.210 --> 48:06.870]  Oh, cool.
[48:06.930 --> 48:08.110]  I need to get...
[48:08.110 --> 48:09.690]  Let's go with the foil.
[48:10.930 --> 48:11.210]  Parallels.
[48:11.350 --> 48:11.870]  Let's leave that.
[48:12.090 --> 48:12.690]  Ooh, that is nice.
[48:12.930 --> 48:14.270]  Max Scherzer.
[48:14.790 --> 48:15.850]  He's got the same eyes as a husky.
[48:15.850 --> 48:16.510]  Oh, with the Mets.
[48:16.570 --> 48:16.870]  That's weird.
[48:16.890 --> 48:17.530]  He doesn't play there anymore.
[48:17.590 --> 48:18.330]  As a husky?
[48:18.430 --> 48:19.070]  Is that what you said?
[48:19.250 --> 48:20.030]  Yeah, he's got...
[48:20.390 --> 48:22.290]  He's an insane man and he has dog eyes.
[48:22.430 --> 48:23.470]  Wait, is that a falcon?
[48:24.010 --> 48:24.790]  That's a red-tailed hawk.
[48:24.870 --> 48:26.990]  So is there just one that is just straight-up falcon?
[48:27.050 --> 48:28.050]  Yeah, there's like a peregrine.
[48:28.270 --> 48:30.350]  I think there's two falcons in this set, actually.
[48:30.450 --> 48:31.070]  We just haven't got them yet.
[48:33.910 --> 48:34.470]  Estuary Ruiz.
[48:35.510 --> 48:39.790]  Ooh, everybody loves Jordan, MVP, Barber, Moises Lopez.
[48:41.330 --> 48:41.730]  Goddammit.
[48:42.610 --> 48:43.510]  That could be you.
[48:43.690 --> 48:44.890]  That should be you.
[48:45.170 --> 48:48.470]  Kyle Schwarber, Stan Musial, Dustin Verlander.
[48:49.230 --> 48:50.530]  Everybody knows what he's famous for.
[48:50.610 --> 48:52.250]  That's weird. He doesn't play for that team anymore.
[48:52.690 --> 48:54.170]  He's famous for Kane Upton.
[48:54.290 --> 48:54.790]  He's Kane Upton.
[48:55.090 --> 48:55.450]  Or he's married.
[48:55.590 --> 48:56.290]  Or he's certainly married.
[48:56.430 --> 48:57.050]  Luis Urias, yeah.
[48:57.390 --> 48:58.190]  Like, they go on dates.
[48:58.230 --> 48:59.810]  They probably dated first before they got married.
[48:59.930 --> 49:03.950]  Do you think these people used a manager, an agent, or someone?
[49:03.950 --> 49:04.430]  Yes.
[49:04.450 --> 49:07.970]  No, I think that you don't approach tops to be an allengander.
[49:08.090 --> 49:09.230]  I think they come to you and they go, hey...
[49:09.230 --> 49:12.650]  They think, like, oh, hey, this Barber, let's get him this.
[49:12.650 --> 49:14.970]  Michael Jordan's Barber? Probably, yeah.
[49:15.110 --> 49:16.130]  We gotta cut Michael Jordan's hair.
[49:16.530 --> 49:16.590]  Jazz.
[49:18.010 --> 49:19.110]  Jazz, she's home.
[49:19.730 --> 49:20.610]  I'll cut their hair.
[49:20.730 --> 49:21.830]  Will Myers, please do.
[49:22.330 --> 49:23.510]  Hey, big Will Myers.
[49:24.630 --> 49:28.350]  Reed Detmers, Kevin Hart again. Ooh, only...
[49:28.350 --> 49:29.030]  Kevin Hart?
[49:29.630 --> 49:30.990]  Oh, Kevin Hart again?
[49:31.290 --> 49:31.890]  Yeah, Hart again.
[49:31.890 --> 49:33.010]  How did he get a card?
[49:34.630 --> 49:35.450]  There it is.
[49:35.510 --> 49:37.030]  How does San Francisco get a card?
[49:37.310 --> 49:37.330]  Hey!
[49:37.710 --> 49:37.970]  Gorgeous.
[49:38.670 --> 49:39.010]  Beautiful.
[49:39.430 --> 49:41.530]  How do temple blocks get a card?
[49:41.690 --> 49:41.930]  What?
[49:42.130 --> 49:42.810]  I don't know what that is.
[49:43.050 --> 49:43.490]  What is it?
[49:44.170 --> 49:46.770]  They had Will Myers in there, the former Padre Will Myers.
[49:46.930 --> 49:47.330]  I love that guy.
[49:47.590 --> 49:48.170]  You love that guy?
[49:48.330 --> 49:48.790]  He's cool.
[49:48.990 --> 49:49.970]  How do you feel about Matt Olsen?
[49:51.310 --> 49:51.670]  Fine.
[49:51.890 --> 49:52.850]  How do you feel about Brandon Marsh?
[49:53.370 --> 49:54.510]  I don't love Brandon Marsh.
[49:54.530 --> 49:55.570]  How do you feel about Liam Hendricks?
[49:55.930 --> 49:57.010]  I don't feel any way about him, really.
[49:57.010 --> 49:58.150]  How do you feel about Barry Zito?
[49:59.150 --> 50:01.210]  Oh, great on the A's, hate him on the Giants.
[50:01.370 --> 50:02.730]  Don Staley, player and coach.
[50:02.870 --> 50:03.170]  All right.
[50:03.170 --> 50:05.170]  Ooh, Randy Johnson for the Expos.
[50:05.570 --> 50:05.930]  Wow.
[50:06.610 --> 50:08.430]  When did Randy Johnson play for the Expos?
[50:08.690 --> 50:11.110]  That's a great question that they're not going to answer here.
[50:11.110 --> 50:11.350]  No.
[50:11.630 --> 50:12.030]  What happened?
[50:12.130 --> 50:13.050]  Is he the one that hit the bird?
[50:13.170 --> 50:13.670]  Yes, he is.
[50:13.790 --> 50:14.170]  Hell yeah.
[50:14.610 --> 50:15.390]  The big unit.
[50:15.570 --> 50:18.630]  And then Lefkoe, Adam Lefkoe with the black parallel.
[50:18.770 --> 50:19.610]  Who's Adam Lefkoe?
[50:19.790 --> 50:21.170]  He's an NBA announcer.
[50:22.290 --> 50:25.110]  He fills in for... when Ernie's not there, he does it.
[50:25.290 --> 50:25.530]  Oh.
[50:25.730 --> 50:26.950]  Steven Strasburg went to my high school.
[50:27.370 --> 50:27.670]  Really?
[50:27.810 --> 50:28.010]  Mm-hmm.
[50:28.070 --> 50:28.690]  Are you guys friends?
[50:29.790 --> 50:31.010]  No, he's much younger than me.
[50:31.570 --> 50:32.830]  Who had a better GPA, you or him?
[50:34.030 --> 50:34.750]  Probably him.
[50:35.770 --> 50:36.890]  Do you guys go to the same parties?
[50:37.590 --> 50:38.810]  No, again, much younger than me.
[50:38.870 --> 50:39.910]  I didn't go to school at that same time.
[50:39.990 --> 50:41.130]  Juan Soto, he plays for the...
[50:41.130 --> 50:42.450]  Yeah, yeah, he does for now.
[50:43.110 --> 50:44.990]  Anthony Rizzo, best baseball name.
[50:46.370 --> 50:47.090]  Oswald Peraza.
[50:48.110 --> 50:48.830]  Rafael Nadal.
[50:49.070 --> 50:49.630]  Didn't he retire?
[50:49.910 --> 50:50.410]  I think he did.
[50:50.930 --> 50:51.270]  Maybe.
[50:51.390 --> 50:52.050]  Clay Court Master.
[50:52.070 --> 50:53.390]  All right.
[50:53.550 --> 50:54.710]  Oh, it's that same card, but bigger.
[50:55.530 --> 50:56.410]  What's your favorite dessert?
[50:56.790 --> 50:57.570]  And why is it...
[50:57.570 --> 50:57.950]  Sundae.
[50:58.170 --> 50:58.530]  Cookies.
[50:58.750 --> 50:59.070]  Oh, yum.
[50:59.070 --> 51:00.110]  That's what you were eating earlier?
[51:00.430 --> 51:00.710]  Wow.
[51:00.730 --> 51:01.990]  We need to make Christmas cookies.
[51:02.190 --> 51:04.330]  We're going to open up two more of these, and then we'll be done with that.
[51:04.330 --> 51:04.490]  Okay.
[51:04.670 --> 51:05.210]  Then we'll move on.
[51:05.610 --> 51:07.290]  We got, I mean, a little less than 10 minutes.
[51:07.310 --> 51:08.510]  Yeah, and then we'll open up this bad boy.
[51:08.530 --> 51:08.710]  Okay.
[51:08.810 --> 51:08.970]  Yeah.
[51:09.110 --> 51:10.210]  I assume there's more than one card in there.
[51:10.350 --> 51:15.570]  Don't forget, if you're watching this live, Beanhole Dirt Pens go on sale at 10 a.m. tomorrow.
[51:15.890 --> 51:19.710]  If you're watching this later, you got to start at richkids.com to see if they're still there.
[51:20.010 --> 51:20.810]  I want a piece of history.
[51:21.030 --> 51:23.830]  And don't forget, we'll probably give you some of these cards at the end of the year.
[51:23.890 --> 51:24.830]  Jose Abreu, somehow.
[51:25.610 --> 51:26.170]  Jacob DeGrom.
[51:27.410 --> 51:27.970]  Pete Alonzo.
[51:27.970 --> 51:29.570]  Some of the pens have cards in them.
[51:29.670 --> 51:30.050]  Ryan Howard.
[51:30.150 --> 51:30.550]  That's true.
[51:32.050 --> 51:33.170]  Nick Pradorucki.
[51:34.530 --> 51:35.650]  Yvonne Herrera.
[51:36.150 --> 51:37.050]  Oh, here we go.
[51:39.350 --> 51:41.950]  Sarah Langs, with Alan and Ginter back.
[51:42.050 --> 51:42.490]  That's cool.
[51:42.750 --> 51:42.910]  What's she?
[51:44.130 --> 51:46.510]  She's a reporter and researcher.
[51:46.830 --> 51:47.290]  Oh!
[51:47.690 --> 51:49.350]  And boom, Peregrine Falcon.
[51:49.630 --> 51:49.810]  Yeah!
[51:49.870 --> 51:50.430]  Falcon!
[51:51.070 --> 51:52.190]  Falcon card!
[51:52.410 --> 51:52.870]  Yes!
[51:52.950 --> 51:54.730]  His name is Rosso or whatever.
[51:55.450 --> 51:56.010]  What was the...
[51:56.010 --> 51:56.350]  Kos.
[51:56.350 --> 51:57.050]  Kos.
[51:57.190 --> 51:58.350]  It's Mayan for...
[51:59.430 --> 51:59.870]  Vengeance?
[52:00.030 --> 52:00.430]  Angry.
[52:00.790 --> 52:01.430]  That's cool.
[52:01.510 --> 52:01.710]  Angry.
[52:01.850 --> 52:03.670]  And I thought it said Ross, and they said no.
[52:03.670 --> 52:04.710]  Wow, like from Friends?
[52:04.930 --> 52:06.290]  Yeah, but he was so cool.
[52:06.350 --> 52:06.850]  Tommy Henry.
[52:07.070 --> 52:08.190]  And he's angry because his friend's dead.
[52:09.650 --> 52:10.530]  Francisco Alvarez.
[52:12.830 --> 52:13.710]  Benny Wasserman.
[52:14.850 --> 52:15.810]  He still plays?
[52:16.770 --> 52:17.650]  Emily to get mad.
[52:19.210 --> 52:20.090]  Jordan Alvarez.
[52:20.410 --> 52:20.770]  Right.
[52:21.030 --> 52:21.790]  Steven Strasberg.
[52:22.110 --> 52:22.350]  Yeah.
[52:22.490 --> 52:24.250]  I've never seen one of these in action.
[52:25.970 --> 52:26.690]  Somebody pitching.
[52:27.010 --> 52:27.370]  Wow.
[52:27.530 --> 52:27.950]  Corbin Burns.
[52:28.930 --> 52:29.290]  Corbin...
[52:29.290 --> 52:32.130]  Here we have a rookie of Michael Harris.
[52:32.410 --> 52:32.650]  Yeah.
[52:32.790 --> 52:33.710]  And then...
[52:33.710 --> 52:34.370]  Bodyboarding!
[52:34.910 --> 52:35.310]  Hell yeah!
[52:35.490 --> 52:36.030]  Fun in the sun!
[52:36.490 --> 52:37.870]  I don't think we have that fun in the sun yet.
[52:37.870 --> 52:38.010]  No.
[52:38.070 --> 52:39.230]  I guess leave it.
[52:39.950 --> 52:40.450]  Take care of that.
[52:40.450 --> 52:43.370]  I'm gonna put this falcon in a double...
[52:43.370 --> 52:44.210]  Yeah, just in case.
[52:44.310 --> 52:45.290]  Yeah, like we gotta...
[52:45.290 --> 52:46.130]  Now are we doing this one?
[52:46.210 --> 52:47.830]  We got seven minutes left, so let's see...
[52:47.830 --> 52:48.450]  So what is this?
[52:48.550 --> 52:48.970]  This is...
[52:48.970 --> 52:51.430]  So we don't know what this is, but you may race to buy it.
[52:51.650 --> 52:52.170]  I don't remember.
[52:52.170 --> 52:52.270]  I don't remember.
[52:52.410 --> 52:54.970]  It costs like 200 bucks, maybe, or 150 bucks.
[52:55.710 --> 52:58.370]  And I asked her to buy it, but I don't remember what it is.
[52:58.570 --> 52:59.410]  Didn't Gracie just shrug?
[52:59.430 --> 53:03.330]  That's why I like Gracie being in charge of the credit card, because then we can get...
[53:03.330 --> 53:04.250]  You can, it's true.
[53:04.790 --> 53:05.010]  Yeah.
[53:05.130 --> 53:05.690]  It's true.
[53:05.850 --> 53:05.990]  Yeah.
[53:06.130 --> 53:07.070]  Gracie's like, I don't give a fuck.
[53:07.190 --> 53:08.090]  Okay, so you...
[53:08.090 --> 53:08.770]  Gracie does not give a fuck.
[53:09.250 --> 53:09.510]  But you don't...
[53:09.510 --> 53:10.750]  So what do you think it's gonna be?
[53:10.850 --> 53:11.850]  I think it's gonna be historical.
[53:12.190 --> 53:14.830]  No, it is definitely gonna be historical, but like, do you think it's gonna be, like,
[53:15.070 --> 53:15.950]  a piece of clothing?
[53:16.470 --> 53:16.850]  Oh, oh, it'll be like...
[53:16.850 --> 53:18.230]  Or like, a dinosaur bone?
[53:18.310 --> 53:19.050]  Or a piece of hair?
[53:19.470 --> 53:19.870]  Autograph?
[53:20.090 --> 53:21.750]  I think it'll be an autograph or a piece of parchment.
[53:21.770 --> 53:24.830]  I think it's the user manual for Grand Theft Auto 3.
[53:26.030 --> 53:26.830]  Oh, shit.
[53:27.150 --> 53:27.530]  What is it?
[53:27.730 --> 53:28.510]  Keepsake edition?
[53:28.930 --> 53:32.250]  I don't know what the fuck we bought, but this is ridiculous.
[53:32.630 --> 53:34.330]  All right, line it up for the camera.
[53:34.710 --> 53:35.230]  Let's see.
[53:35.830 --> 53:36.690]  There's a fucking light.
[53:36.690 --> 53:37.930]  It's simply too good.
[53:38.870 --> 53:39.390]  Okay, let's see.
[53:39.470 --> 53:39.950]  Watch this.
[53:40.750 --> 53:41.770]  Hey, don't touch that!
[53:43.170 --> 53:43.970]  There's a light!
[53:44.090 --> 53:44.450]  Whoa.
[53:45.350 --> 53:46.070]  What is it?
[53:46.190 --> 53:46.710]  All right, let's see.
[53:47.170 --> 53:48.250]  What is it?
[53:49.370 --> 53:50.090]  All right.
[53:50.310 --> 53:50.670]  Keepsake edition.
[53:50.670 --> 53:51.290]  All right, are you guys ready?
[53:51.550 --> 53:51.710]  Yeah.
[53:51.890 --> 53:52.150]  2023.
[53:52.710 --> 53:53.330]  Let's hold off.
[53:53.590 --> 53:53.910]  No!
[53:54.070 --> 53:54.850]  I need to know now!
[53:55.470 --> 53:55.830]  Wow!
[53:56.870 --> 53:57.290]  We'll see.
[53:57.430 --> 53:58.430]  We'll open up some more basketball cards.
[53:58.530 --> 53:59.530]  You son of a bitch.
[54:00.530 --> 54:01.970]  Okay, so is something...
[54:03.110 --> 54:03.830]  Is it...
[54:03.830 --> 54:04.790]  Oh, God.
[54:05.170 --> 54:05.530]  Okay.
[54:05.970 --> 54:06.690]  It's historical.
[54:07.110 --> 54:07.470]  It is?
[54:07.470 --> 54:08.290]  It's a historical figure.
[54:08.410 --> 54:08.590]  Okay.
[54:08.670 --> 54:09.430]  Do you guys want to go...
[54:09.430 --> 54:11.370]  But is it a card or is it a piece of a thing?
[54:11.430 --> 54:12.310]  Or is it just, like, a side card?
[54:12.410 --> 54:13.390]  I saw the name.
[54:13.450 --> 54:13.930]  That's all I saw.
[54:14.790 --> 54:15.150]  Okay.
[54:15.470 --> 54:16.890]  Do you think it's, like...
[54:16.890 --> 54:17.190]  KCP.
[54:17.310 --> 54:18.110]  Like Albert Einstein?
[54:18.110 --> 54:18.750]  Or...
[54:18.750 --> 54:19.150]  Oh, yeah.
[54:19.190 --> 54:19.570]  Okay.
[54:19.890 --> 54:20.350]  Joe Harris.
[54:20.510 --> 54:20.710]  Or an artist?
[54:20.710 --> 54:21.350]  Is that your thought?
[54:21.530 --> 54:22.030]  John Collins?
[54:22.030 --> 54:23.270]  Okay, do we think it's, like, a celebrity?
[54:23.630 --> 54:24.650]  An artist?
[54:25.050 --> 54:25.750]  Robert Burns?
[54:25.990 --> 54:26.730]  Scotty Barnes?
[54:27.410 --> 54:27.850]  Uh...
[54:27.850 --> 54:28.610]  Like a...
[54:28.610 --> 54:29.390]  President?
[54:29.850 --> 54:30.450]  Jadon Sharp?
[54:30.510 --> 54:31.450]  I think it's Andrew Jackson.
[54:31.790 --> 54:32.230]  Oh!
[54:32.410 --> 54:32.650]  Oh!
[54:32.890 --> 54:33.810]  Is he your favorite president?
[54:34.870 --> 54:36.190]  Yeah, I agree with everything you did.
[54:36.190 --> 54:39.270]  Were you the one that, like, really fought hard to keep him on the team?
[54:39.270 --> 54:39.510]  Yeah!
[54:39.730 --> 54:41.010]  I was like, don't you...
[54:41.010 --> 54:42.250]  Don't you change it!
[54:42.630 --> 54:43.910]  Don't you change it!
[54:44.010 --> 54:45.410]  That's why you voted for Trump, right?
[54:45.410 --> 54:45.970]  That's why...
[54:46.690 --> 54:49.550]  Well, I was just doing what you were telling me to do, so...
[54:49.550 --> 54:51.410]  Yeah, I mean, I saw some really cool videos.
[54:51.450 --> 54:51.810]  Joker!
[54:51.970 --> 54:52.790]  I can send you some.
[54:52.930 --> 54:53.450]  Oh, shit!
[54:54.590 --> 54:55.210]  Tatum Powerhouse.
[54:55.210 --> 54:55.250]  Hey!
[54:56.490 --> 54:57.510]  Terry Eason rookie.
[54:58.970 --> 55:00.390]  So let's leave those.
[55:00.590 --> 55:01.390]  Okay, that was fun.
[55:01.530 --> 55:01.970]  And basketball.
[55:02.370 --> 55:03.550]  Okay, so now we have five left.
[55:03.810 --> 55:04.730]  Let's see if we can see...
[55:04.730 --> 55:06.190]  I wanna see what's in the box.
[55:06.190 --> 55:06.890]  Let's pick up one more.
[55:06.970 --> 55:07.270]  Yeah!
[55:08.350 --> 55:09.070]  Mosaic football.
[55:09.310 --> 55:09.870]  Hanger pad.
[55:09.970 --> 55:10.570]  Hangers or bangers?
[55:11.110 --> 55:11.450]  Oh, no.
[55:12.930 --> 55:13.750]  I'd say you're not a hanger.
[55:13.890 --> 55:14.570]  It's just a...
[55:15.250 --> 55:16.270]  Okay, let's see.
[55:16.410 --> 55:18.510]  I don't even know who's good for football this year.
[55:18.510 --> 55:18.550]  Let's go!
[55:18.910 --> 55:23.650]  Adam Thielen, Aaron Jones, Dwight Stevenson, Darren Wallard...
[55:23.650 --> 55:23.910]  Oh!
[55:24.070 --> 55:27.510]  Jerry Rice, Heinz Ward, Byron Young...
[55:27.510 --> 55:28.370]  That's your friend Heinz Ward.
[55:28.670 --> 55:29.110]  DJ...
[55:29.110 --> 55:30.150]  That's my friend Heinz Ward.
[55:30.230 --> 55:30.970]  DJ Johnson, that's true.
[55:31.010 --> 55:31.650]  I didn't meet him.
[55:31.750 --> 55:33.070]  He shared the field with him.
[55:34.090 --> 55:36.570]  Andre Reid, Cam Akers...
[55:38.350 --> 55:40.850]  Oh, that young, fresh quarterback everybody's talking about.
[55:40.930 --> 55:41.590]  Dan Marino.
[55:42.150 --> 55:43.650]  And his buddy Phil Sims.
[55:43.650 --> 55:44.050]  Yeah!
[55:44.390 --> 55:45.930]  A couple of young bucks, baby.
[55:46.070 --> 55:49.630]  Teddy Bushy, Derwin James, and then Jordan Love.
[55:50.110 --> 55:50.750]  Silver parallel.
[55:50.890 --> 55:51.870]  Can you just leave that, Jordan Love?
[55:51.870 --> 55:54.710]  I like Teddy Bruschi because he did a bunch of steroids and broke his neck and then came
[55:54.710 --> 55:57.070]  back and he always wore the big collar thing on the back.
[55:57.070 --> 55:58.070]  I'm going to go...
[55:58.070 --> 55:58.450]  He knows.
[55:58.470 --> 55:59.550]  Okay, so you're going presidential.
[55:59.810 --> 56:00.010]  Yeah.
[56:00.370 --> 56:02.970]  I'm going to go, like, just celebrity.
[56:03.250 --> 56:03.410]  Okay.
[56:03.590 --> 56:04.370]  Gracie, you have a guess?
[56:05.810 --> 56:06.410]  Okay, no.
[56:08.790 --> 56:09.270]  Let's see.
[56:09.770 --> 56:11.270]  This is going to blow your fucking mind.
[56:11.310 --> 56:11.490]  Okay.
[56:11.570 --> 56:12.190]  What is it?
[56:12.190 --> 56:13.030]  This is ridiculous.
[56:13.170 --> 56:13.430]  Okay.
[56:14.110 --> 56:14.910]  So stupid.
[56:14.990 --> 56:15.870]  Is it Jesus?
[56:16.770 --> 56:18.310]  It's Julius Caesar.
[56:18.330 --> 56:19.390]  What the fuck?
[56:19.490 --> 56:19.830]  How?
[56:19.990 --> 56:20.070]  How?
[56:21.470 --> 56:22.410]  It is...
[56:22.410 --> 56:22.570]  What?
[56:24.430 --> 56:25.350]  It is...
[56:25.350 --> 56:26.210]  What the fuck is that?
[56:26.250 --> 56:26.910]  Is that a ruby?
[56:27.110 --> 56:28.890]  It's an authentic Julius Caesar.
[56:30.630 --> 56:31.130]  This...
[56:31.130 --> 56:31.530]  How?
[56:31.810 --> 56:32.650]  I can't fucking read this.
[56:32.750 --> 56:33.830]  That's why they have a light?
[56:33.830 --> 56:43.830]  Hello, our authentic, original, and genuine items that are guaranteed by Superior Productions Incorporated.
[56:43.990 --> 56:47.830]  This card features a piece of...
[56:48.810 --> 56:50.030]  Can you read this?
[56:50.070 --> 56:50.570]  It's so small.
[56:50.590 --> 56:51.170]  Yeah.
[56:51.230 --> 56:51.750]  Come on, Grandpa.
[56:52.570 --> 56:58.490]  This card contains a genuine, authentic, and real garnet gemstone, ranging from 5 millimeters
[56:58.490 --> 57:00.110]  to 10 millimeters in size.
[57:00.950 --> 57:07.630]  Gemstones acquired from a 20-year-old gemologist, diamond, and gemstone dealer located in the
[57:07.630 --> 57:09.270]  jewelry district in Los Angeles.
[57:09.590 --> 57:10.730]  This doesn't have anything to do with Julius Caesar.
[57:10.730 --> 57:11.250]  No, it does.
[57:11.310 --> 57:11.950]  It has that, too.
[57:12.590 --> 57:12.990]  Oh.
[57:13.450 --> 57:17.330]  It has the gemstone at the bottom, and then this is a piece of his clothes.
[57:18.190 --> 57:19.490]  Oh, it's leather.
[57:19.770 --> 57:21.630]  It's like woven leather with some of that.
[57:21.890 --> 57:22.170]  It's like a piece...
[57:22.170 --> 57:22.550]  Move.
[57:22.710 --> 57:22.910]  Move.
[57:23.010 --> 57:23.130]  Here.
[57:25.150 --> 57:25.550]  What?
[57:25.790 --> 57:26.310]  Can you...
[57:26.310 --> 57:28.610]  Fisher, can you just zoom, like, way in on this fucking thing?
[57:28.870 --> 57:29.510]  What is this?
[57:29.510 --> 57:31.170]  Like, that's, like, braided leather.
[57:31.410 --> 57:35.590]  Yeah, that's a piece of his leather shoes or something, and then that's the little gemstone.
[57:35.590 --> 57:38.850]  On the back, I think it's showing you, like, his outfit.
[57:38.850 --> 57:40.090]  There's the gem, and there's...
[57:40.090 --> 57:40.630]  It came from his, like, tunic.
[57:40.630 --> 57:41.590]  Gracie, what did you buy?
[57:41.790 --> 57:42.150]  Tunic.
[57:42.770 --> 57:43.450]  Buy more.
[57:43.610 --> 57:44.510]  We need more.
[57:44.670 --> 57:45.450]  I want more of these.
[57:45.710 --> 57:46.570]  What the fuck?
[57:46.610 --> 57:48.150]  We've got a garnet gemstone.
[57:49.390 --> 57:50.930]  Do you think PSA would grade it?
[57:51.550 --> 57:52.550]  Yeah, I do, actually.
[57:53.490 --> 57:54.810]  Uh, that's fucking crazy.
[57:54.990 --> 57:55.870]  So we have...
[57:55.870 --> 57:56.330]  It's...
[57:56.330 --> 57:58.350]  Dude, we're getting a pretty historical collection here.
[57:58.430 --> 57:59.210]  Dude, we have a museum.
[57:59.210 --> 58:00.350]  We have Da Vinci, right?
[58:00.450 --> 58:01.450]  We got Falcons.
[58:01.590 --> 58:02.470]  We got jet skis.
[58:02.570 --> 58:03.810]  We've got a piece of paper.
[58:04.130 --> 58:04.330]  We've got Julius Caesar.
[58:05.150 --> 58:05.850]  Like, it goes in the...
[58:05.850 --> 58:08.030]  That's Julius Caesar, used knife, one of 12.
[58:08.610 --> 58:10.490]  That is so...
[58:10.490 --> 58:12.490]  Yeah, like, that's, like...
[58:12.490 --> 58:14.550]  The original et tu, Brute?
[58:15.190 --> 58:15.590]  Dang.
[58:15.890 --> 58:17.330]  It's what he was wearing when he got stabbed, bro.
[58:17.530 --> 58:19.670]  Yes, and it's from his little outfit right here.
[58:19.690 --> 58:21.250]  What year did Julius Caesar die?
[58:21.650 --> 58:22.650]  What year did Julius Caesar die?
[58:22.650 --> 58:24.910]  Gracie, can you look up what year Julius Caesar died?
[58:25.370 --> 58:29.190]  And then how the fuck it made it to Rooster Teeth Productions.
[58:29.190 --> 58:29.670]  Hell yeah.
[58:29.750 --> 58:30.290]  In 2023.
[58:31.690 --> 58:32.850]  I'm gonna say 79.
[58:33.870 --> 58:35.390]  I think he died in, like...
[58:35.390 --> 58:35.730]  What?
[58:35.950 --> 58:36.830]  44 B.C.
[58:36.830 --> 58:38.290]  44 B.C.?
[58:38.290 --> 58:40.370]  So this is older than...
[58:40.370 --> 58:40.570]  Me.
[58:40.570 --> 58:41.650]  ...assuming you believe in him.
[58:41.650 --> 58:43.510]  That's older than the Christ King Jesus?
[58:43.810 --> 58:44.010]  Yeah.
[58:44.210 --> 58:44.830]  Oh my God.
[58:45.050 --> 58:45.510]  Dang.
[58:46.550 --> 58:47.030]  Dang.
[58:47.130 --> 58:50.550]  That's older than Baby Jesus, Teenage Jesus, Adult Jesus, all rolled into one.
[58:50.650 --> 58:50.930]  Wow.
[58:51.190 --> 58:51.670]  Dang.
[58:53.390 --> 58:54.830]  It's Julius fucking Caesar.
[58:55.030 --> 58:55.890]  That's insane.
[58:56.170 --> 58:56.670]  That's pretty cool.
[58:57.270 --> 58:57.390]  Wow.
[58:57.390 --> 58:57.810]  That's pretty cool.
[58:57.810 --> 59:00.510]  So, do you have a piece of Julius Caesar's tunic?
[59:00.650 --> 59:03.950]  I don't know that this is a legal thing that we can own.
[59:04.170 --> 59:04.750]  They have it.
[59:04.770 --> 59:05.410]  And if it is...
[59:05.410 --> 59:06.530]  It belongs in a museum!
[59:06.550 --> 59:08.650]  We shouldn't be allowed to have this.
[59:08.690 --> 59:09.770]  We're gonna have to create a museum.
[59:09.850 --> 59:10.250]  We're gonna...
[59:10.250 --> 59:12.370]  This is not something that should be allowed.
[59:13.050 --> 59:13.750]  But we have it.
[59:14.070 --> 59:14.350]  I agree.
[59:14.670 --> 59:15.270]  It shouldn't...
[59:15.270 --> 59:16.290]  We shouldn't...
[59:16.290 --> 59:16.930]  We own...
[59:16.930 --> 59:17.510]  We shouldn't...
[59:17.510 --> 59:18.550]  We own some Caesar.
[59:18.570 --> 59:21.730]  It looks like it has, like, some, like, dust and dirt on it.
[59:21.750 --> 59:23.330]  It's got blood on it from when we got stabbed.
[59:23.510 --> 59:24.590]  You probably can't sell this in Australia.
[59:24.590 --> 59:25.350]  You probably can't sell it.
[59:25.370 --> 59:26.430]  If it's got dirt in it.
[59:27.290 --> 59:29.210]  So, we better open that up.
[59:29.230 --> 59:30.910]  Or else we're gonna have, like, a biohazard.
[59:30.910 --> 59:33.490]  I don't understand how we can own this.
[59:33.970 --> 59:35.350]  Gracie, put it on the card.
[59:36.090 --> 59:37.530]  I don't even know.
[59:37.570 --> 59:38.490]  She knows how to do this.
[59:38.690 --> 59:39.590]  She knows!
[59:39.990 --> 59:41.610]  Gracie's doing, like, back-channel deals.
[59:41.750 --> 59:42.690]  Yeah, she's on the...
[59:42.690 --> 59:45.310]  She bought this on the dark web.
[59:45.350 --> 59:46.490]  Gracie's on the Silk Road.
[59:46.510 --> 59:48.230]  It's Julius Caesar relics.
[59:48.350 --> 59:48.910]  Hell, yeah.
[59:49.990 --> 59:50.430]  Dang!
[59:50.550 --> 59:51.310]  We shouldn't...
[59:51.310 --> 59:52.210]  Oh, it's so fun!
[59:52.290 --> 59:53.730]  Yay! More, more, more!
[59:54.010 --> 59:54.710]  This is crazy.
[59:54.710 --> 59:55.550]  How fucking cool is that?
[59:56.130 --> 59:58.410]  Julius Caesar and Mark McGuire.
[59:59.490 --> 01:00:00.870]  Who can hit more dingers?
[01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:02.190]  And Larry Bird.
[01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:04.110]  And a falcon and Larry Bird.
[01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:06.290]  Welcome to the Break Show.
[01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:07.050]  It's this.
[01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:07.770]  This is it.
[01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:08.310]  This is it.
[01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:08.630]  This is it.
[01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:09.450]  This is kinda it.
[01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.930]  Right there.
[01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:10.450]  There you go.
[01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:11.690]  Wherever my fun...
[01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:12.610]  Oh, and Captain Sandy.
[01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:13.250]  We gotta have her.
[01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:14.090]  And Captain Sandy.
[01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:15.830]  This is, uh...
[01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:16.530]  This is what the show is.
[01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:17.190]  And a big booty.
[01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:19.050]  Dude, what a starting lineup that would be.
[01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:19.410]  Wow.
[01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:20.990]  She would drive the boat.
[01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.790]  He would, like, command it.
[01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:23.950]  Drive the boat!
[01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:26.030]  These guys would be...
[01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.190]  I don't know.
[01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:29.610]  The falcon's checking ahead to make sure and getting, like, food for everybody.
[01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:30.530]  Dude.
[01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:31.470]  That's a...

[01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:35.730]  Thanks for tuning in for another week of the Break Show.
[01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:43.390]  Hey, tell everybody you've ever met that you saw a piece of Julius Caesar's clothes.
[01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:44.170]  Not in Rome.
[01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:44.610]  Yeah, dude.
[01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:48.150]  I was watching this show that I like, and they got a piece of Julius Caesar's clothes.
[01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:52.270]  Stop people on the street and say, hey, you're never gonna fucking believe this.
[01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:54.330]  Did you know Julius Caesar was real?
[01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:57.510]  And they still have his stuff?
[01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:58.050]  Yeah.

[01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:02.190]  And they're giving it out for, like, a hundred bucks?
[01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:03.670]  What the fuck?
[01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:04.270]  Buy a pen tomorrow.

[01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:17.010]  Wow!
[01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:19.090]  Dang, do you think Caesar signed it?
[01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:19.590]  Yeah, probably.
