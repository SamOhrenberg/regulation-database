[00:14.360 --> 00:19.240]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Face Break Show.
[00:19.700 --> 00:22.600]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, these two,
[00:23.800 --> 00:25.080]  Eric and Emily.
[00:25.540 --> 00:26.300]  Close. Other way.
[00:26.320 --> 00:26.780]  Back around.
[00:27.640 --> 00:29.920]  She has better chemistry with Gus than I do.
[00:30.360 --> 00:35.140]  Yes. A lot of people were acknowledging that she and Gus had really good chemistry together.
[00:35.400 --> 00:36.540]  I gotta be honest, I'm a little worried now.
[00:36.840 --> 00:39.080]  Well, you said that Gus was on his best behavior with me.
[00:39.280 --> 00:40.680]  He was. He was definitely on his best.
[00:40.760 --> 00:42.800]  And it's interesting because Gus has been a real prick to me lately.
[00:42.800 --> 00:44.660]  And so I think I also noticed it.
[00:44.820 --> 00:45.360]  No, he's not.
[00:45.700 --> 00:46.760]  Yeah. Yeah, he was good today.
[00:46.840 --> 00:50.400]  But last week, he was bound and determined to get on my fucking nerves.
[00:51.420 --> 00:52.040]  That's okay, though.
[00:52.040 --> 00:54.460]  That's what people that have known each other for 108 years do.
[00:54.520 --> 00:55.880]  They drive each other insane.
[00:56.080 --> 00:58.060]  They do a podcast together and they make each other crazy.
[00:58.220 --> 00:58.800]  Yeah, pretty much.
[00:58.880 --> 00:59.880]  Speaking of podcasts.
[01:01.160 --> 01:02.700]  This isn't one. This is a break show.
[01:02.800 --> 01:03.500]  No, it's true.
[01:03.600 --> 01:05.240]  But you have a new one coming out.
[01:05.500 --> 01:06.180]  This fucking guy.
[01:06.980 --> 01:07.620]  Next week!
[01:07.620 --> 01:10.980]  So All Right premieres next week.
[01:11.060 --> 01:13.040]  Monday for First Members, Tuesday for everyone else.
[01:13.280 --> 01:15.800]  It is Geoff's solo podcast.
[01:16.540 --> 01:19.140]  Geoff, how do you feel about So All Right?
[01:19.340 --> 01:21.600]  I like it. I feel good. I feel all right.
[01:21.800 --> 01:25.120]  It's a podcast where I talk about stuff I care about.
[01:25.160 --> 01:25.360]  Yeah.
[01:25.640 --> 01:26.660]  That's maybe not funny.
[01:27.260 --> 01:28.400]  Maybe funny adjacent.
[01:28.580 --> 01:28.760]  Yeah.
[01:28.840 --> 01:29.960]  Just stuff that's more interesting to me.
[01:30.020 --> 01:34.880]  I would call it informative because I felt informed while listening to it.
[01:35.460 --> 01:36.040]  But also...
[01:36.040 --> 01:36.720]  But also entertained.
[01:36.720 --> 01:37.280]  Yes.
[01:37.420 --> 01:40.080]  And I think the way that you talked about it, you described it really well.
[01:40.520 --> 01:46.640]  You tell me a bunch of facts that I can regurgitate at a party and it seems like I found a really cool thing.
[01:46.820 --> 01:49.280]  But really, it's you going, do you know about this shit?
[01:49.720 --> 01:52.300]  Yeah, go tell this story at a party.
[01:52.300 --> 01:53.520]  It's awesome. It's really cool.
[01:53.780 --> 01:55.580]  I really, really, really like it.
[01:55.960 --> 01:57.400]  I give you party topics.
[01:57.500 --> 01:58.420]  Yeah, 100%.
[01:59.020 --> 02:00.820]  Yeah, well, check it out maybe next week if you want.
[02:00.880 --> 02:01.280]  It's a podcast.
[02:01.660 --> 02:03.880]  It's on Podcast Places where they do podcast things.
[02:03.880 --> 02:06.760]  But right now, we're doing card shit.
[02:06.880 --> 02:07.500]  That's right, baby.
[02:07.640 --> 02:09.280]  We're doing card shit.
[02:09.640 --> 02:12.760]  And so, the first thing we tend to do...
[02:12.760 --> 02:13.880]  We're building this lore out.
[02:14.000 --> 02:14.580]  We're building this world out.
[02:14.620 --> 02:16.740]  The first thing we have been doing is opening something from the pack sack.
[02:16.920 --> 02:19.200]  But I want to do something before that.
[02:19.300 --> 02:19.440]  Okay.
[02:19.720 --> 02:20.680]  I have...
[02:20.680 --> 02:22.100]  I did it after episode one.
[02:22.240 --> 02:23.580]  And so, after episode two, I'm going to do it.
[02:23.600 --> 02:24.260]  We'll just make it a thing.
[02:24.400 --> 02:24.600]  Okay.
[02:25.120 --> 02:26.420]  Last episode was a special episode.
[02:26.500 --> 02:26.920]  We had Gus.
[02:26.980 --> 02:28.100]  We opened up a lot of his cards.
[02:28.300 --> 02:32.300]  We scratched the surface of opening up a lot of cards in his childhood.
[02:32.300 --> 02:34.860]  And I said I'd report back to you guys on values.
[02:34.980 --> 02:35.620]  Oh, that's right.
[02:35.740 --> 02:35.860]  Yeah.
[02:35.920 --> 02:37.160]  So, what I did was I went home.
[02:37.260 --> 02:37.940]  It's a little hard.
[02:38.040 --> 02:41.740]  There's a lot of websites that will tell you approximate value for junk wax cards.
[02:41.800 --> 02:42.660]  But they're all outdated.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.760]  And so, what I went through is I painstakingly went through the PSA report and through YouTube and 130 Point.
[02:48.860 --> 02:53.480]  And I got the most recent sales of PSA 10 versions of all these cards.
[02:53.620 --> 02:53.740]  Oh, wow.
[02:53.900 --> 02:55.460]  Most of these aren't going to pull a PSA 10.
[02:55.580 --> 02:58.520]  But we might as well, if we're going to look at it, let's look at what the maximum value is.
[02:58.660 --> 03:00.380]  And I was just going to burn through it real fast.
[03:00.400 --> 03:00.900]  Let's do it.
[03:00.900 --> 03:01.160]  Okay.
[03:01.160 --> 03:02.540]  For a little edification for the audience.
[03:02.780 --> 03:02.840]  Okay.
[03:03.140 --> 03:03.860]  I'm excited.
[03:04.220 --> 03:05.520]  I thought that might be a nice thing.
[03:05.580 --> 03:09.280]  And these are all from the Gus cards that were in storage for, like, 30 years, right?
[03:09.400 --> 03:09.540]  Yeah.
[03:09.680 --> 03:13.400]  These were all in Gus's storage facility for the last 35 years.
[03:13.520 --> 03:13.720]  Okay.
[03:13.800 --> 03:15.020]  So, the first card, I'm going to go fast.
[03:15.140 --> 03:15.320]  Okay.
[03:15.380 --> 03:15.600]  Here we go.
[03:15.600 --> 03:17.020]  This is a 1990 Fleer John Smoltz.
[03:17.480 --> 03:17.860]  $13.
[03:18.280 --> 03:18.520]  Wow.
[03:18.600 --> 03:20.460]  There's only 22 PSA 10s in existence.
[03:20.880 --> 03:23.040]  This is a 1990 Bowman Bo Jackson.
[03:23.660 --> 03:24.040]  $50.
[03:24.360 --> 03:24.680]  Wow.
[03:24.920 --> 03:25.280]  Oh, all right.
[03:25.280 --> 03:26.220]  Randy Johnson rookie.
[03:28.800 --> 03:32.660]  Uh, there have been no PSA 10s for sale.
[03:33.040 --> 03:34.640]  I saw a PSA 8 for $5.
[03:35.040 --> 03:37.220]  So, you've got to figure a PSA 10 is probably around $40 or $50.
[03:37.220 --> 03:37.420]  Yeah.
[03:37.720 --> 03:38.040]  Randy, cool.
[03:38.160 --> 03:40.680]  King Griffey Jr., 90 Donners, $55.
[03:41.040 --> 03:41.220]  Okay.
[03:41.800 --> 03:42.480]  That's not bad.
[03:43.320 --> 03:44.400]  1990 Bo Jackson.
[03:44.640 --> 03:45.240]  This is the big guy.
[03:45.440 --> 03:45.620]  Uh-huh.
[03:45.680 --> 03:48.000]  There's only 65 PSA 10s in existence.
[03:48.160 --> 03:48.360]  Okay.
[03:49.200 --> 03:50.200]  This is worth $150.
[03:50.520 --> 03:50.640]  Dang.
[03:50.640 --> 03:51.380]  Wow, really?
[03:51.560 --> 03:51.960]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:52.020 --> 03:53.280]  Do you think that would count as a 10?
[03:53.920 --> 03:54.320]  No.
[03:54.360 --> 03:54.520]  No.
[03:54.520 --> 03:56.040]  No, but maybe a 9.
[03:56.420 --> 03:58.420]  Uh, Bo Jackson MVP card, 65.
[03:58.660 --> 03:59.700]  Gary Sheffield, 20.
[04:00.000 --> 04:00.940]  There's only 10 of those in existence.
[04:01.360 --> 04:02.600]  1990 Donners, Ricky Henderson.
[04:03.020 --> 04:04.200]  There were no comps.
[04:04.480 --> 04:05.260]  Nobody's bought this card.
[04:05.300 --> 04:05.360]  Wow, really?
[04:05.460 --> 04:05.960]  PSA 10.
[04:05.960 --> 04:06.340]  Oh, wow.
[04:06.660 --> 04:07.980]  So, I have no idea what it's worth.
[04:07.980 --> 04:08.280]  Cool.
[04:08.580 --> 04:10.000]  But there are 63 in existence.
[04:10.160 --> 04:11.640]  It's just the people that own them are holding on to them.
[04:11.680 --> 04:12.640]  Because everybody loves Ricky Henderson.
[04:12.800 --> 04:13.120]  Wow.
[04:13.260 --> 04:14.700]  Just not as much as Ricky Henderson loves Ricky Henderson.
[04:14.860 --> 04:16.840]  1990 Donners, Barry Bonds, $55.
[04:17.560 --> 04:18.140]  Sammy Sosa.
[04:18.380 --> 04:18.940]  This is an interesting one.
[04:19.020 --> 04:19.940]  This card is worth $35.
[04:20.660 --> 04:23.900]  Do you know how many PSA 10s this wins for most PSA 10s?
[04:24.240 --> 04:24.500]  There are a lot of PSA 10s.
[04:24.520 --> 04:27.740]  There are 1129 PSA 10s of this card.
[04:28.080 --> 04:28.220]  Wow.
[04:28.440 --> 04:29.340]  We might have a PSA 10.
[04:29.500 --> 04:30.620]  It is not rare at all.
[04:30.680 --> 04:30.740]  No.
[04:31.480 --> 04:33.840]  Kirby Puckett for $35.
[04:34.140 --> 04:34.840]  No, $60.
[04:35.580 --> 04:36.940]  These King of the Juniors are $60.
[04:37.360 --> 04:37.680]  Oh, jeez.
[04:37.820 --> 04:40.400]  This Tom Glavine is $25 and $100 for this Sammy Sosa.
[04:40.520 --> 04:41.040]  Wow, really?
[04:41.460 --> 04:43.580]  That's the worst picture of Sammy Sosa I've ever seen.
[04:44.660 --> 04:45.020]  Yeah.
[04:45.420 --> 04:46.000]  I'll go with that.
[04:46.160 --> 04:47.960]  He's had some changes I learned about.
[04:48.220 --> 04:48.680]  Oh, yeah.
[04:48.940 --> 04:49.240]  Yeah.
[04:49.340 --> 04:51.140]  2023 Sammy Sosa looks different.
[04:51.620 --> 04:51.680]  Different.
[04:51.760 --> 04:52.380]  Beefed up a bit.
[04:52.840 --> 04:53.240]  Okay.
[04:53.420 --> 04:54.360]  So, you want to get into sack, pack, pack, sack?
[04:54.420 --> 04:54.500]  So, let's get into sack, pack, pack, sack.
[04:54.500 --> 04:57.660]  So, let's do a pack sack and then I want to present something else new.
[04:58.200 --> 04:58.220]  Oh.
[04:58.440 --> 04:59.400]  There's a lot happening.
[04:59.460 --> 05:00.020]  Little idea.
[05:00.160 --> 05:00.860]  I like this.
[05:01.200 --> 05:01.980]  Break show's fun.
[05:02.220 --> 05:02.900]  Yeah, break show is fun.
[05:03.020 --> 05:04.280]  We try to have fun with it.
[05:04.480 --> 05:04.720]  Okay.
[05:04.920 --> 05:05.880]  Me and Joe have been hanging out all day.
[05:06.160 --> 05:06.460]  That's true.
[05:06.580 --> 05:06.760]  We have.
[05:06.860 --> 05:08.040]  Eric and I have been spending a lot of time together.
[05:08.100 --> 05:08.280]  Yeah.
[05:08.620 --> 05:13.600]  This is Star VI Model Search Venus Swimwear International Model Search.
[05:13.760 --> 05:14.080]  Okay.
[05:14.640 --> 05:15.760]  Win stuff, see back.
[05:15.860 --> 05:17.320]  Nine limited edition cards.
[05:17.420 --> 05:17.620]  Okay.
[05:17.760 --> 05:19.420]  Now, these are made in the USA.
[05:21.020 --> 05:22.820]  1994 in Boca Raton, Florida.
[05:22.820 --> 05:25.300]  That's where you would have many swimsuit competitions.
[05:25.880 --> 05:26.240]  Okay.
[05:26.280 --> 05:26.800]  Let's see what we got.
[05:26.940 --> 05:28.340]  They are stuck together.
[05:29.300 --> 05:31.500]  Bend them kind of like the whole pack back and forth.
[05:31.640 --> 05:31.960]  Oh, come on.
[05:31.960 --> 05:34.600]  This is when you're going to get a lot of like the high cut bottoms.
[05:34.600 --> 05:34.620]  Yeah.
[05:34.960 --> 05:35.500]  Big time.
[05:36.040 --> 05:36.620]  Big high cut.
[05:36.620 --> 05:38.700]  Really like Kelly Bundy type stuff.
[05:38.780 --> 05:39.140]  Oh, yeah.
[05:39.320 --> 05:39.440]  Yeah.
[05:40.380 --> 05:41.100]  Oh, Christ.
[05:41.220 --> 05:41.420]  Okay.
[05:41.460 --> 05:41.800]  Let's see.
[05:43.360 --> 05:43.940]  Oh, God.
[05:44.860 --> 05:46.180]  Somebody got a hold of these before I could.
[05:46.260 --> 05:46.620]  Ew.
[05:47.240 --> 05:47.900]  Stuck them up.
[05:48.180 --> 05:48.820]  Denise Piero.
[05:51.020 --> 05:51.740]  Jennifer Turner.
[05:51.740 --> 05:52.640]  Uh-huh.
[05:52.660 --> 05:53.400]  These are all moms.
[05:53.600 --> 05:54.080]  Yeah.
[05:54.140 --> 05:55.100]  These are hot moms.
[05:55.320 --> 05:55.400]  Yeah.
[05:55.820 --> 05:57.800]  Robin Basker.
[05:57.940 --> 05:58.180]  Okay.
[05:58.660 --> 05:59.880]  They're all stuck together.
[05:59.900 --> 06:00.360]  Oh, my God.
[06:00.460 --> 06:03.960]  It's just like fucking just 30 years of dry jizz.
[06:04.060 --> 06:04.460]  Ew.
[06:05.020 --> 06:05.740]  Tamara Haggett.
[06:07.360 --> 06:08.320]  Ramona Robertson.
[06:08.420 --> 06:08.560]  Okay.
[06:08.600 --> 06:09.920]  That's at the back of Robin Christie.
[06:10.180 --> 06:10.300]  Okay.
[06:10.480 --> 06:12.220]  And then Tina Springham.
[06:12.320 --> 06:15.240]  And then on the back is Caitlin Cumsack.
[06:15.360 --> 06:15.960]  Not what?
[06:16.620 --> 06:17.100]  Carmack.
[06:17.180 --> 06:17.620]  Carmack.
[06:17.780 --> 06:18.460]  Oh, come on.
[06:18.560 --> 06:20.680]  And then Tammy Redden.
[06:20.680 --> 06:21.780]  Okay, there you go.
[06:21.860 --> 06:22.360]  These are terrible.
[06:22.480 --> 06:23.980]  Those bikinis, yeah, those carts suck.
[06:24.120 --> 06:24.880]  These are hot chicks.
[06:25.920 --> 06:26.400]  I don't know.
[06:26.960 --> 06:27.280]  Come on.
[06:27.340 --> 06:28.220]  Yeah, just...
[06:28.380 --> 06:28.480]  Ugh.
[06:28.800 --> 06:29.060]  Gross.
[06:29.680 --> 06:30.040]  Okay.
[06:30.980 --> 06:32.160]  I want to present you guys a little something.
[06:32.240 --> 06:32.520]  Okay.
[06:33.080 --> 06:35.860]  I was hanging out in the library with Emily the other night.
[06:36.280 --> 06:36.420]  What?
[06:36.500 --> 06:37.260]  I showed her something.
[06:37.540 --> 06:38.860]  You're hanging out in the library?
[06:39.280 --> 06:41.060]  It's the room in our house with books.
[06:41.260 --> 06:42.160]  So it's called the library.
[06:42.740 --> 06:43.440]  Oh, you're studying.
[06:43.660 --> 06:44.400]  Facebook shelves.
[06:44.460 --> 06:45.000]  It's an office.
[06:45.420 --> 06:46.820]  The office, library, bookshelves.
[06:47.040 --> 06:50.260]  And I showed her something that I've been holding onto for about three or four years.
[06:50.260 --> 06:50.540]  Okay.
[06:51.020 --> 06:53.260]  This is what's called a RIP card.
[06:53.800 --> 06:53.980]  Okay?
[06:54.080 --> 06:54.840]  It's huge, right?
[06:54.940 --> 06:55.140]  You can see it.
[06:55.140 --> 06:55.900]  Yes, Ripken RIP card.
[06:56.120 --> 06:57.060]  Ripken RIP card, yeah.
[06:57.560 --> 07:00.360]  And I've been holding onto it because it is pretty valuable.
[07:00.640 --> 07:02.660]  You can see it's numbered here at the bottom.
[07:02.780 --> 07:07.760]  I don't know if you can see that, but it is numbered number 31 of 75.
[07:07.900 --> 07:08.480]  What is it?
[07:08.580 --> 07:10.280]  So there's only 75 of these in existence.
[07:10.580 --> 07:10.680]  Okay.
[07:10.860 --> 07:14.840]  Comes as a box topper if you buy a hobby box of, I believe, Allen and Ginter.
[07:15.620 --> 07:16.560]  Yeah, Allen and Ginter.
[07:16.780 --> 07:17.700]  It's from 2021.
[07:18.160 --> 07:21.440]  And so you usually don't get it.
[07:21.500 --> 07:22.060]  They're pretty rare.
[07:22.240 --> 07:23.700]  And then to get one of a good player is rare.
[07:23.800 --> 07:25.480]  And then to get one that's numbered is even more rare.
[07:25.860 --> 07:28.740]  This one goes for, last time I checked, this goes for about $300 to $400.
[07:29.240 --> 07:29.600]  Whoa!
[07:29.840 --> 07:30.240]  This card.
[07:30.440 --> 07:31.640]  Don't touch it.
[07:31.660 --> 07:34.340]  Now the reason that I brought it to you guys, I wanted to show it to you.
[07:34.420 --> 07:35.940]  I've been holding onto it for three or four years.
[07:36.180 --> 07:40.140]  It's because a RIP card is a very special thing that Topps does.
[07:40.760 --> 07:43.720]  Inside this card are two mini cards.
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.720]  Those mini cards could be very valuable.
[07:48.040 --> 07:50.260]  They could be a one-of-one Shohei Otani rookie.
[07:50.720 --> 07:53.680]  They could be these little metal...
[07:53.680 --> 07:54.640]  I'm like sweating already.
[07:54.660 --> 07:56.880]  You're saying could be.
[07:57.080 --> 07:57.420]  Could be.
[07:57.600 --> 07:58.840]  What else could they be?
[07:58.960 --> 07:59.440]  They could be nothing.
[07:59.560 --> 08:00.060]  They could be trash.
[08:00.180 --> 08:00.880]  They could be base cards.
[08:00.980 --> 08:01.380]  They could be nothing.
[08:02.200 --> 08:03.000]  They could be...
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.720]  The chances are that what's in here is not worth this.
[08:06.840 --> 08:08.020]  Which is why I've never opened it.
[08:08.060 --> 08:08.660]  You can see right here.
[08:09.440 --> 08:14.840]  Inside this card will be an exclusive mini stained glass parallel and...
[08:14.840 --> 08:15.500]  So you get one of those.
[08:15.680 --> 08:16.600]  Two of the following.
[08:16.720 --> 08:22.180]  An exclusive mini parallel, or a mini wood parallel, or a mini metal parallel, or ink autograph card, or one-of-a-kind sketch card.
[08:22.180 --> 08:23.240]  Oh my god!
[08:23.740 --> 08:24.160]  Boy!
[08:24.800 --> 08:26.060]  Are you going to open this?
[08:27.200 --> 08:30.880]  I have not been able to make myself open it for four years.
[08:31.100 --> 08:32.200]  What would it take?
[08:32.300 --> 08:32.480]  So what we decided...
[08:33.000 --> 08:34.080]  Emily recommended this.
[08:34.200 --> 08:36.920]  She said, what if you put a poll up and you let the audience choose?
[08:37.180 --> 08:38.260]  Do I open it?
[08:38.260 --> 08:39.560]  I'm like literally sweating.
[08:39.820 --> 08:42.140]  And let the audience decide, because I can't make the decision myself.
[08:42.240 --> 08:46.680]  I've wanted to open this for years, but I also don't want to trash a $300 card.
[08:46.720 --> 08:48.500]  It's such a, like, press the red button thing.
[08:48.680 --> 08:49.340]  But you're like, ooh!
[08:49.400 --> 08:52.100]  But I just don't know, so I'm going to put it in the audience's hands.
[08:52.180 --> 08:53.440]  Maybe we can set up a poll on social.
[08:53.740 --> 08:55.000]  Can we put a poll in the chat?
[08:55.320 --> 08:56.460]  Is that...
[08:56.460 --> 08:57.360]  Does that work still?
[08:58.100 --> 08:58.460]  I don't...
[08:58.460 --> 08:59.080]  I have no idea.
[08:59.380 --> 09:00.660]  Should we give it time to marinate?
[09:00.780 --> 09:01.320]  Should he open...
[09:01.320 --> 09:03.260]  No, I want this poll to go up.
[09:03.260 --> 09:07.680]  And I want to know if we can get a poll up that...
[09:07.680 --> 09:08.980]  Do we open this card?
[09:09.340 --> 09:10.100]  And see how it...
[09:10.100 --> 09:10.760]  Oh my God.
[09:10.980 --> 09:11.920]  This is crazy.
[09:12.340 --> 09:14.740]  But if you don't want to, like, let's not do it.
[09:14.880 --> 09:16.720]  Like, at the end of the day, this is your toy.
[09:17.460 --> 09:20.320]  So it's like, if you don't want to, then don't do it.
[09:20.320 --> 09:21.600]  Well, I want to leave it to the audience.
[09:21.700 --> 09:22.160]  I want to let them decide.
[09:22.180 --> 09:24.700]  The audience may say, like, no, that's foolish to open this.
[09:24.900 --> 09:25.000]  Right, right.
[09:25.080 --> 09:27.220]  And then we can circle back in, like, six months or something.
[09:27.440 --> 09:29.700]  Yeah, but if the audience is like, no, we definitely want to see what's in there.
[09:29.740 --> 09:30.540]  We think you should open it.
[09:30.600 --> 09:30.800]  Right.
[09:31.080 --> 09:32.960]  Then I'm amenable to it.
[09:32.960 --> 09:33.200]  Okay.
[09:33.500 --> 09:35.180]  But it could be something, like, so cool.
[09:35.300 --> 09:36.700]  Dude, it could be a one-of-a-kind sketch card.
[09:36.740 --> 09:37.500]  It could be a one-of-one.
[09:37.720 --> 09:38.260]  It could be...
[09:38.260 --> 09:39.760]  These fucking...
[09:39.760 --> 09:43.000]  These metal parallels are very sought after.
[09:43.640 --> 09:45.380]  People magnet the cards to see if they have the metal.
[09:45.380 --> 09:48.160]  I was going to say, like, is there a way for us to, like...
[09:48.160 --> 09:48.500]  No.
[09:48.580 --> 09:49.300]  It's so...
[09:49.300 --> 09:50.080]  They keep it...
[09:50.080 --> 09:50.780]  They try...
[09:50.780 --> 09:51.500]  They don't want you to cheat.
[09:51.980 --> 09:55.780]  But I've bought probably ten hobby boxes of Alan and Ginter over the years, and this is
[09:55.780 --> 09:57.500]  the only RIP card I've ever received.
[09:57.820 --> 09:58.140]  Wow.
[09:58.180 --> 09:58.960]  And it's like...
[09:59.440 --> 10:01.020]  Isn't that related to the fuckface?
[10:01.080 --> 10:01.840]  Like, Billy Ripken?
[10:01.840 --> 10:02.440]  That's his brother.
[10:02.700 --> 10:03.700]  That's his brother.
[10:04.040 --> 10:05.840]  That's a funny way to qualify.
[10:06.780 --> 10:08.720]  One of the greatest baseball players of all time.
[10:08.780 --> 10:10.800]  That is very funny to qualify that.
[10:11.280 --> 10:11.500]  Yeah.
[10:12.300 --> 10:12.660]  Wow.
[10:12.920 --> 10:13.980]  Anyway, something to think about.
[10:14.380 --> 10:14.740]  Okay.
[10:14.860 --> 10:17.900]  We'll see if we get a pull-up, and then we can...
[10:17.900 --> 10:20.520]  If we get the pull-up, it'll be on the Rooster Teeth site.
[10:20.560 --> 10:21.340]  We're going to pray about it.
[10:22.100 --> 10:22.740]  There you go.
[10:23.000 --> 10:23.360]  Wow.
[10:23.540 --> 10:24.200]  I can't...
[10:24.200 --> 10:24.780]  What would you do?
[10:25.200 --> 10:26.300]  Would you open it, or would you leave it?
[10:27.600 --> 10:28.500]  I think so.
[10:28.600 --> 10:29.840]  Bird of the hand, two in the bush.
[10:30.040 --> 10:30.240]  Fuck.
[10:31.500 --> 10:32.720]  But here's the thing...
[10:32.720 --> 10:33.380]  Different coin, same side?
[10:33.540 --> 10:34.660]  Two coins, same side.
[10:37.660 --> 10:38.660]  Inside weekend joke.
[10:38.980 --> 10:39.580]  It's a pool joke.
[10:39.620 --> 10:40.400]  It's a pool joke.
[10:40.600 --> 10:42.720]  The thing about it is that I like...
[10:42.720 --> 10:46.720]  Like, it's worth something, but it's only worth something because we haven't opened it.
[10:46.960 --> 10:48.460]  Well, it's worth something right now.
[10:48.660 --> 10:50.000]  Like, I could sell this for $354.
[10:50.000 --> 10:50.720]  Right, right.
[10:50.800 --> 10:54.080]  But the reason it's worth something, because of what is inside of it.
[10:54.080 --> 10:56.940]  No, it's worth it because it's a Cal Ripken Jr. numbered to 75.
[10:56.940 --> 10:58.640]  Which could have secret stuff inside, though.
[10:58.640 --> 11:02.200]  But it has value on its own as a Cal Ripken Jr. card.
[11:03.040 --> 11:03.360]  Man.
[11:03.780 --> 11:06.660]  And the chances are that that card is more valuable than what's inside it.
[11:06.740 --> 11:12.100]  But if it's not, if what's inside it is more valuable, it might be more valuable by a factor of five or six.
[11:12.320 --> 11:12.640]  Wow.
[11:13.160 --> 11:15.120]  I could have a couple grand in there, just sitting there.
[11:15.400 --> 11:15.940]  That's crazy.
[11:16.060 --> 11:16.320]  All right.
[11:16.600 --> 11:19.540]  Well, we'll see if we get that poll going, but we should open something, and then we'll come back to it.
[11:19.560 --> 11:20.300]  We'll circle back.
[11:20.420 --> 11:22.880]  Speaking of open, I want to do a little bit of mail.
[11:23.960 --> 11:26.040]  So this is a letter from Sarah.
[11:27.220 --> 11:29.840]  Which, by the way, is the best way to start a letter.
[11:29.840 --> 11:30.700]  Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:31.820 --> 11:33.900]  I don't know how to do a better job than that.
[11:34.240 --> 11:34.640]  Sup, dickheads.
[11:35.380 --> 11:39.220]  I wanted to say a little thank you for bringing so much joy into my life with the fuckface.
[11:39.680 --> 11:41.620]  When you started the show, I was stuck in a pretty bad place.
[11:41.740 --> 11:42.440]  Me, too, actually.
[11:43.000 --> 11:44.020]  But you gave me an escape.
[11:44.280 --> 11:44.840]  You gave me laughter.
[11:45.320 --> 11:45.920]  What was the least we could do?
[11:46.280 --> 11:48.060]  Long-time regulation listener, first-time comment leaver.
[11:48.200 --> 11:51.280]  And I thought, what better way to become a comment leaver than with a gift of gratitude?
[11:51.420 --> 11:55.300]  Please find enclosed some artwork and some trading cards you might get a laugh out of.
[11:55.300 --> 11:56.540]  Yes, they are from a real event.
[11:56.640 --> 11:57.740]  Okay, thanks for everything, Sarah.
[11:57.920 --> 11:58.600]  Thank you, Sarah.
[11:58.660 --> 11:59.240]  This is the art.
[11:59.340 --> 12:00.860]  First of all, I'll put that right there so you can see it.
[12:00.860 --> 12:01.520]  Oh, that's awesome.
[12:01.860 --> 12:02.620]  So I'll do it.
[12:02.700 --> 12:03.560]  That's me on the left.
[12:04.120 --> 12:04.600]  That's you.
[12:04.960 --> 12:07.060]  And then there's the picture of Andrew.
[12:07.280 --> 12:08.800]  And then Eric looking way too dignified.
[12:08.880 --> 12:10.220]  Looking good, looking good.
[12:10.460 --> 12:11.380]  So that's gorgeous.
[12:11.560 --> 12:16.780]  Once again, as always, blown away by how much more talented the audience is than us.
[12:16.780 --> 12:23.780]  And then they also sent with it some Frankfurt Quidditch World Cup 23-24...
[12:25.520 --> 12:27.380]  Oh, July 23-24, 2016.
[12:27.720 --> 12:27.860]  Okay.
[12:27.920 --> 12:30.000]  So apparently that was the Frankfurt Quidditch World Cup.
[12:30.100 --> 12:32.040]  And I'm not going to look at all of them, but we'll look at a few right now.
[12:32.220 --> 12:33.540]  Here's Jessica Adrian.
[12:33.900 --> 12:35.700]  She was the head organizer of promo events.
[12:36.020 --> 12:37.840]  Oh, here's Hector Cabrera.
[12:37.980 --> 12:39.100]  He was a referee and volunteer.
[12:39.840 --> 12:40.660]  Diego Avila.
[12:40.940 --> 12:41.320]  Okay.
[12:41.580 --> 12:42.660]  Potential biohazard.
[12:43.740 --> 12:45.680]  Here's Andoni Arangurin.
[12:46.420 --> 12:47.180]  Here's Spain.
[12:47.480 --> 12:50.680]  Nobody expects the Spanish Inquidisition.
[12:51.740 --> 12:52.120]  Inquidisition.
[12:52.600 --> 12:52.980]  Inquidisition.
[12:53.720 --> 12:54.480]  That sucks.
[12:54.800 --> 12:55.860]  Frank A.
[12:56.100 --> 12:56.640]  Hey, Frank.
[12:57.140 --> 12:58.120]  Because he lives.
[12:58.380 --> 12:59.850]  Open my Barra Dorada.
[13:01.240 --> 13:02.520]  Becada Stable Ladada.
[13:02.580 --> 13:04.540]  I don't think you should be saying any of this stuff.
[13:04.620 --> 13:05.880]  Eduardo Rubino.
[13:05.920 --> 13:06.180]  I really don't think you should be saying any of this stuff.
[13:06.340 --> 13:07.420]  Did I just curse someone?
[13:07.480 --> 13:07.960]  Yeah, probably.
[13:08.580 --> 13:09.340]  Blathnade Kluski.
[13:09.420 --> 13:10.060]  Anyway, you get the idea.
[13:10.120 --> 13:11.000]  These are pretty fucking cool.
[13:11.120 --> 13:12.420]  We'll look at some more of those later.
[13:12.800 --> 13:13.360]  Thank you, Sarah.
[13:13.520 --> 13:14.420]  Those are lovely.
[13:14.420 --> 13:15.760]  And it's really good art.
[13:15.960 --> 13:16.120]  Yep.
[13:16.300 --> 13:18.340]  We do have a poll open on the Rooster Teeth site.
[13:18.460 --> 13:19.380]  It was 72%.
[13:19.380 --> 13:22.100]  That's why we pay a mod on the ball.
[13:22.360 --> 13:23.260]  So we have it.
[13:23.380 --> 13:24.000]  Yes or no.
[13:24.020 --> 13:24.740]  Should he open the card?
[13:24.780 --> 13:25.560]  You have to vote right now.
[13:25.620 --> 13:26.700]  If you're watching this later, guess what?
[13:26.720 --> 13:27.260]  You missed it.
[13:27.360 --> 13:27.980]  I already peck-sacked.
[13:28.100 --> 13:28.900]  But you can watch it.
[13:29.080 --> 13:29.960]  You can watch the show live.
[13:30.480 --> 13:31.160]  It's on Rooster Teeth.
[13:31.680 --> 13:34.300]  Live with chat every Monday at 4 p.m.
[13:34.380 --> 13:34.900]  Central time.
[13:35.160 --> 13:36.240]  Should we just open up some cards now?
[13:36.340 --> 13:37.160]  Yes, absolutely.
[13:37.380 --> 13:37.980]  What you got here, bud?
[13:38.120 --> 13:39.520]  Remember last week or last time?
[13:39.600 --> 13:39.880]  I do.
[13:40.100 --> 13:41.880]  When I brought those Monopoly prisms and they were dog shit?
[13:41.940 --> 13:44.220]  Well, I was able to secure one more box.
[13:44.220 --> 13:45.560]  And I want to try one more time.
[13:45.680 --> 13:45.860]  Yeah.
[13:45.940 --> 13:48.980]  This will be the fifth one of these I've opened in my life.
[13:49.060 --> 13:49.540]  Oh, wow.
[13:49.560 --> 13:50.320]  Are you excited?
[13:50.540 --> 13:51.580]  I've had zero hits.
[13:51.900 --> 13:53.500]  Oh, but you're pumped now, right here.
[13:53.580 --> 13:54.500]  This is it, right here, baby.
[13:54.720 --> 13:55.540]  This is the fifth time's a charm.
[13:55.700 --> 13:56.380]  Fifth time's a charm.
[13:56.700 --> 13:57.140]  Hell yeah.
[13:57.240 --> 13:58.820]  Cool hands, Luca, on the front, right?
[13:58.980 --> 13:59.200]  Yep.
[14:00.260 --> 14:01.520]  Looking for Marky Smarts.
[14:02.000 --> 14:02.180]  Of course.
[14:02.180 --> 14:03.500]  Always looking for Marky Smarts.
[14:03.760 --> 14:04.240]  Marky Smarts.
[14:04.520 --> 14:06.660]  Looking for anything that's a parallel and not a base card.
[14:06.680 --> 14:07.080]  Love it.
[14:07.800 --> 14:08.320]  Love it.
[14:09.220 --> 14:10.800]  Get this party started.
[14:11.000 --> 14:11.420]  I don't know.
[14:11.500 --> 14:11.880]  I was trying.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.160]  I got to get that.
[14:13.160 --> 14:14.060]  Oh, shit.
[14:14.100 --> 14:15.240]  All right, well, we're off to a good start.
[14:15.360 --> 14:15.600]  Okay.
[14:15.680 --> 14:16.560]  Mike Conley.
[14:16.780 --> 14:17.280]  Mike Conley.
[14:18.060 --> 14:18.460]  Joker.
[14:19.120 --> 14:19.420]  Yeah.
[14:19.940 --> 14:20.980]  Darius Garland base.
[14:21.140 --> 14:21.740]  And then...
[14:21.740 --> 14:22.440]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[14:22.520 --> 14:24.040]  Year two, Cade Cunningham.
[14:24.040 --> 14:24.360]  Oh, no.
[14:24.560 --> 14:24.960]  Parallel.
[14:24.980 --> 14:25.300]  All right.
[14:25.300 --> 14:25.720]  That's nice.
[14:25.720 --> 14:26.280]  That looks cool.
[14:26.340 --> 14:26.720]  Is it like...
[14:26.720 --> 14:27.580]  That's nice.
[14:28.040 --> 14:31.020]  I think that's called a red money shimmer.
[14:31.500 --> 14:31.900]  Parallel.
[14:31.980 --> 14:32.780]  I don't know why.
[14:32.880 --> 14:34.820]  It's the red money symbol for Monopoly.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.020]  And that is numbered 16 to 100.
[14:37.300 --> 14:37.660]  Wow.
[14:37.800 --> 14:39.560]  That is a bona fide hit.
[14:39.620 --> 14:41.600]  Would you put that in a sleeve and a top loader, please?
[14:42.560 --> 14:43.360]  That's probably...
[14:43.360 --> 14:43.980]  A double sleeve?
[14:44.560 --> 14:44.740]  Yeah.
[14:45.580 --> 14:48.660]  Do you think that's worth more or less than the Bo Jackson that we have from Gus's?
[14:49.400 --> 14:49.440]  Less.
[14:50.140 --> 14:52.800]  That's what I'm going to judge everything now, because Gus is our biggest hit.
[14:52.880 --> 14:53.780]  Shadon Sharp, rookie.
[14:54.120 --> 14:54.440]  Base.
[14:54.740 --> 14:55.300]  Just leave that.
[14:55.680 --> 14:56.680]  Tyrese Halliburton.
[14:56.820 --> 14:59.780]  Fred Van Vliet, Houston's newest star.
[15:00.260 --> 15:00.960]  Max Contract?
[15:01.340 --> 15:01.780]  Max Contract.
[15:02.140 --> 15:04.260]  Only non-drafted player in history to get a Max Contract.
[15:05.040 --> 15:06.460]  Like, that's going to...
[15:06.460 --> 15:06.820]  I don't know.
[15:06.880 --> 15:07.520]  That's going to be the guy?
[15:07.660 --> 15:11.400]  Listen, I don't understand why anybody would pay Max Contract money for an undersized card.
[15:11.400 --> 15:14.900]  And I'm nothing against Fred Van Vliet, including any of those guys.
[15:14.940 --> 15:18.440]  Especially in the league where everyone's going to be 6'9 and play every position.
[15:19.060 --> 15:19.160]  Yeah.
[15:19.360 --> 15:22.000]  I love an undersized card.
[15:22.240 --> 15:22.700]  A lot of fun.
[15:22.840 --> 15:22.920]  Same.
[15:23.020 --> 15:23.600]  Super fun.
[15:23.920 --> 15:25.380]  Like, a guy that I really enjoy.
[15:26.140 --> 15:27.420]  Max Contract money for that?
[15:27.640 --> 15:28.320]  Fucking insane.
[15:28.400 --> 15:28.640]  Insane.
[15:28.980 --> 15:29.420]  Insane.
[15:29.520 --> 15:30.140]  I love it.
[15:30.600 --> 15:31.500]  Prove me wrong.
[15:31.880 --> 15:34.900]  Jeremy Sochan, John Morant, Clay Thompson.
[15:35.700 --> 15:37.260]  Alright, we got three more packs.
[15:37.280 --> 15:37.680]  I love it.
[15:37.680 --> 15:41.180]  I doubt there'll be anything good in them, because we already got that out-the-gate card.
[15:41.460 --> 15:44.420]  Anthony Edwards tearing it up for Team USA right now.
[15:45.060 --> 15:46.780]  Definitely the star of that team.
[15:47.160 --> 15:50.520]  Kyrie Irving, Jalen Brunson, and Nikola Jokic.
[15:50.920 --> 15:51.760]  Two Jokers.
[15:52.000 --> 15:52.540]  Two Jokers.
[15:52.660 --> 15:53.520]  Double Joker, baby.
[15:53.900 --> 15:55.260]  Got the Joker, and then his alternate.
[15:55.720 --> 15:57.240]  No Cool Hand Lukas yet?
[15:57.620 --> 15:58.820]  Damian Lillard, no.
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.120]  Terry Eason rookie.
[16:00.660 --> 16:01.100]  Pascal...
[16:01.100 --> 16:01.920]  Let's just leave that.
[16:02.840 --> 16:03.960]  Pascal Siaka.
[16:04.600 --> 16:05.320]  And then...
[16:05.320 --> 16:07.180]  LeBron James.
[16:08.540 --> 16:09.420]  LeBron James.
[16:12.440 --> 16:13.700]  Alright, last pack.
[16:14.120 --> 16:15.140]  Last pack mojo.
[16:17.300 --> 16:18.220]  Karl-Anthony Towns.
[16:18.980 --> 16:19.160]  Yup.
[16:19.300 --> 16:20.380]  Big Cat, as they call him.
[16:20.380 --> 16:20.580]  Yeah!
[16:21.080 --> 16:22.440]  Kevin Durant, the Slim Reaper.
[16:22.820 --> 16:24.160]  Or the Durantula, they call him.
[16:24.380 --> 16:26.160]  RJ Barrett, they call him...
[16:26.160 --> 16:27.060]  RJ Barrett.
[16:27.180 --> 16:27.420]  RJ.
[16:27.740 --> 16:29.980]  And then Jaden Hardy with the card.
[16:30.320 --> 16:30.940]  We'll go ahead and sleep.
[16:31.020 --> 16:33.120]  You know, not a bad...
[16:33.120 --> 16:33.960]  It was not bad.
[16:34.060 --> 16:34.720]  Not a bad pull.
[16:35.220 --> 16:37.100]  It was okay for the one...
[16:37.100 --> 16:38.740]  Two base rookies and one...
[16:39.560 --> 16:40.280]  One decent card.
[16:40.300 --> 16:40.960]  You wanna get into this?
[16:41.240 --> 16:41.780]  Let's get into this.
[16:41.820 --> 16:42.240]  What is this?
[16:42.500 --> 16:43.640]  A little bit of mail that we got.
[16:44.700 --> 16:45.020]  Fuckfacecareof...
[16:45.020 --> 16:46.100]  I don't know the person's address.
[16:46.240 --> 16:46.980]  Yeah, it's fine.
[16:47.780 --> 16:48.220]  Let's see.
[16:48.400 --> 16:48.540]  He wrote in.
[16:48.620 --> 16:49.380]  Now this is very cool.
[16:49.460 --> 16:49.720]  Yes.
[16:50.000 --> 16:51.540]  I'll read this out loud.
[16:51.900 --> 16:53.680]  Hi guys, comment leavers, Colin and Sarah here.
[16:53.760 --> 16:55.700]  We were excited to see you at the Beanhole Days.
[16:55.800 --> 16:55.940]  Yeah.
[16:56.460 --> 16:57.380]  Keep going, keep going.
[16:57.700 --> 16:58.520]  We didn't make it.
[16:58.560 --> 17:01.720]  Much to our chagrin, we arrived and much later found out through your Instagram announcement
[17:01.720 --> 17:02.980]  that you're not gonna be able to make it.
[17:02.980 --> 17:05.760]  We thought you guys might enjoy a peek behind the bean curtain
[17:05.760 --> 17:08.220]  and a limited run on-card autograph souvenir.
[17:08.380 --> 17:08.900]  Thanks for all you do.
[17:08.960 --> 17:12.160]  Colin and Sarah, for a bonus, do a pencil rub below
[17:12.160 --> 17:13.840]  and I can actually read what it says here.
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.180]  It says...
[17:15.180 --> 17:16.640]  Eat the pencil.
[17:17.820 --> 17:19.160]  The thing I didn't notice before?
[17:20.260 --> 17:20.900]  One of two.
[17:21.280 --> 17:21.640]  Wow.
[17:21.660 --> 17:22.280]  That's so funny.
[17:22.420 --> 17:22.920]  There's another one out there.
[17:22.920 --> 17:23.440]  That's so cool.
[17:23.760 --> 17:24.260]  There's another one out there.
[17:24.420 --> 17:25.360]  First off, here's the photos.
[17:25.480 --> 17:25.940]  Here's some photos.
[17:26.080 --> 17:26.800]  Welcome to Beanhole Day.
[17:26.920 --> 17:27.620]  Here's Beanhole Days.
[17:28.660 --> 17:29.980]  We'll hang these up on the wall.
[17:30.000 --> 17:30.740]  Yeah, I think it's really nice.
[17:30.740 --> 17:33.400]  And then here's a picture of the beans.
[17:33.600 --> 17:34.220]  Oh, yeah.
[17:34.300 --> 17:35.260]  That's what we missed out on.
[17:35.420 --> 17:35.600]  Trucks.
[17:35.760 --> 17:36.480]  And then I love this.
[17:36.540 --> 17:38.520]  This is the Beanhole King and Queen holding.
[17:39.180 --> 17:40.700]  What are they holding, Geoff?
[17:40.980 --> 17:41.680]  The autograph.
[17:42.820 --> 17:45.180]  Queen Bean and King Bean right here.
[17:45.400 --> 17:45.960]  Isn't that so cool?
[17:46.060 --> 17:46.740]  This metal...
[17:49.000 --> 17:49.940]  One of two.
[17:49.940 --> 17:50.440]  One of two.
[17:50.740 --> 17:51.220]  Art card.
[17:51.360 --> 17:51.780]  Wow.
[17:52.440 --> 17:53.980]  And it's been held by...
[17:53.980 --> 17:54.600]  They've been blessed.
[17:54.620 --> 17:57.160]  It's been blessed by the King and Queen themselves.
[17:57.200 --> 17:57.640]  Queen Bean.
[17:58.360 --> 17:59.060]  One of two.
[17:59.640 --> 18:01.520]  Jill Anderson and Blazac.
[18:01.640 --> 18:01.820]  Yep.
[18:01.880 --> 18:02.420]  There you go.
[18:03.560 --> 18:04.360]  So we'll...
[18:04.360 --> 18:06.920]  First off, we will cherish these always.
[18:06.940 --> 18:08.640]  The photos are going on the wall for sure.
[18:08.800 --> 18:08.900]  Yep.
[18:09.180 --> 18:10.420]  And that thing is just gorgeous.
[18:10.620 --> 18:11.220]  We cannot thank you.
[18:11.220 --> 18:11.820]  That was beautiful.
[18:12.020 --> 18:13.560]  Oh, that's so cute.
[18:13.800 --> 18:15.320]  I feel very lucky and excited to have that.
[18:15.880 --> 18:19.060]  Did you see his little cane that has a little bean on top?
[18:19.780 --> 18:20.480]  Oh, wow.
[18:20.540 --> 18:21.540]  That's so cool.
[18:21.740 --> 18:23.360]  I didn't see that, but that's pretty cool.
[18:23.620 --> 18:24.060]  That's pretty cool.
[18:24.280 --> 18:24.660]  That's pretty cool.
[18:24.660 --> 18:28.500]  I was doing something in our backyard yesterday, and I...
[18:28.500 --> 18:32.600]  The Dutch oven that you use to make the beans is still just sitting in our backyard.
[18:32.760 --> 18:32.920]  Yeah.
[18:32.920 --> 18:34.020]  Behind the pizza oven.
[18:34.220 --> 18:34.940]  In the weather.
[18:35.140 --> 18:35.780]  Just rotting.
[18:35.840 --> 18:36.940]  I was like, that needs to go in the museum.
[18:37.280 --> 18:38.480]  Yeah, I cleaned it.
[18:38.540 --> 18:39.020]  I just left it in the backyard.
[18:39.020 --> 18:40.160]  I think you just hosed it off.
[18:41.720 --> 18:42.540]  What if we next...
[18:42.540 --> 18:43.100]  We open up...
[18:43.100 --> 18:43.520]  What's this?
[18:43.660 --> 18:44.060]  Oh, I love it.
[18:44.880 --> 18:45.600]  Topscomb Tennis.
[18:46.280 --> 18:47.060]  Looking for that.
[18:48.740 --> 18:50.400]  I was like...
[18:50.400 --> 18:51.200]  Oh, wait.
[18:51.280 --> 18:52.020]  Now this...
[18:52.020 --> 18:52.720]  That's more tennis.
[18:54.700 --> 18:55.420]  Lucy Safarova.
[18:55.480 --> 18:55.800]  Okay.
[18:57.700 --> 18:58.500]  Gustavo Kuerten.
[18:58.920 --> 18:59.520]  Uh-huh.
[18:59.760 --> 19:01.280]  Oh, Ivanovich.
[19:01.540 --> 19:02.920]  That's an ace right there, baby.
[19:03.860 --> 19:04.800]  Let's sleeve that.
[19:05.120 --> 19:06.000]  And then Christy Pidgeon.
[19:06.100 --> 19:07.200]  She lived in the old times.
[19:09.400 --> 19:10.460]  That's how everything looked.
[19:10.760 --> 19:15.240]  I saw a TikTok that was like, this is what it was like to live in the 90s on a rainy day.
[19:15.280 --> 19:17.780]  And it had like a sepia tone kind of like filter to it.
[19:17.840 --> 19:19.520]  And I just went, well, that's not what the 90s is like.
[19:20.520 --> 19:22.340]  It didn't have a filter on it.
[19:22.580 --> 19:24.660]  Here's a pack of 1991 Tops Major League Baseball.
[19:25.080 --> 19:26.660]  We'll be looking for a Don Zimmer here.
[19:26.780 --> 19:28.020]  After this one...
[19:28.020 --> 19:28.100]  Yeah.
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.280]  We have the results of the poll.
[19:29.500 --> 19:30.160]  Oh, shit.
[19:31.000 --> 19:31.400]  Already?
[19:31.980 --> 19:32.160]  Yep.
[19:32.160 --> 19:32.820]  That was fast.
[19:35.080 --> 19:35.740]  Alfredo Peña.
[19:36.820 --> 19:37.220]  Greg...
[19:37.220 --> 19:37.880]  Alfredo...
[19:38.580 --> 19:39.280]  Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[19:39.320 --> 19:40.180]  It's Alejandro Peña.
[19:40.940 --> 19:41.340]  Peña...
[19:41.340 --> 19:41.620]  No.
[19:42.820 --> 19:43.620]  Greg Briley.
[19:45.360 --> 19:46.160]  Howard Johnson.
[19:46.340 --> 19:47.420]  Oh, that's like a...
[19:47.420 --> 19:48.060]  Name is a Place.
[19:48.360 --> 19:48.580]  Yep.
[19:48.980 --> 19:49.180]  Yeah.
[19:49.480 --> 19:49.900]  That is...
[19:49.900 --> 19:50.340]  I mean...
[19:50.340 --> 19:51.380]  I don't know how many of those are gonna be.
[19:51.380 --> 19:51.660]  Name is a Place.
[19:51.660 --> 19:53.100]  It's a specific one.
[19:53.100 --> 19:53.840]  It's a really specific player.
[19:53.940 --> 19:54.360]  I don't know.
[19:54.840 --> 19:55.580]  Andy Benes.
[19:55.620 --> 19:56.380]  Look at Albert Hall.
[19:56.520 --> 19:58.080]  That's a Padre, Andy Benes.
[19:58.200 --> 19:58.780]  I've never heard of Andy Benes.
[19:58.960 --> 19:59.660]  Gino Petralli.
[20:01.160 --> 20:02.000]  Carlos Quinn.
[20:02.120 --> 20:02.560]  Ta-da!
[20:03.780 --> 20:04.660]  Terry Pendleton.
[20:06.760 --> 20:07.640]  Jerome Walton.
[20:07.680 --> 20:08.000]  Uh-huh.
[20:08.960 --> 20:09.840]  Ellis Burke.
[20:09.880 --> 20:10.140]  Okay.
[20:10.340 --> 20:11.740]  I'm not seeing any collection cards in here.
[20:11.840 --> 20:11.980]  No.
[20:12.180 --> 20:12.720]  Jordan Orton.
[20:13.800 --> 20:14.680]  Mickey Morandini.
[20:14.940 --> 20:15.280]  Uh-huh.
[20:17.440 --> 20:18.760]  Do we have a...
[20:18.760 --> 20:19.120]  Uh-huh.
[20:19.200 --> 20:20.660]  Oh, yeah, well, we have a...
[20:20.660 --> 20:22.420]  He's a real yuck-looking guy.
[20:22.540 --> 20:22.800]  I was looking through all the...
[20:22.800 --> 20:24.580]  Would you say that he's not well?
[20:25.020 --> 20:25.460]  Or...
[20:25.460 --> 20:26.720]  He's inhuman?
[20:27.400 --> 20:28.080]  Oh, we have...
[20:28.080 --> 20:28.540]  Oh, boy.
[20:28.620 --> 20:29.280]  That's what it is.
[20:29.400 --> 20:29.960]  Oh, boy.
[20:31.300 --> 20:32.220]  Oh, boy.
[20:32.280 --> 20:32.800]  That's exactly...
[20:33.180 --> 20:33.260]  Yeah.
[20:33.320 --> 20:33.580]  That's him.
[20:33.580 --> 20:34.380]  Jim Sherrill.
[20:34.400 --> 20:34.680]  Uh-huh.
[20:36.300 --> 20:36.740]  Todd...
[20:37.660 --> 20:38.540]  Todd Benzinger.
[20:39.100 --> 20:39.940]  That's one of them.
[20:40.380 --> 20:43.240]  Carl Nichols and Tom Browning.
[20:43.320 --> 20:44.080]  So, no Don Zimmers.
[20:44.200 --> 20:44.760]  That's okay.
[20:44.920 --> 20:45.360]  Well...
[20:45.360 --> 20:46.220]  We'll get him next time.
[20:46.260 --> 20:46.820]  We have the result.
[20:48.000 --> 20:48.440]  Oh...
[20:48.440 --> 20:49.280]  If we're gonna open this.
[20:49.280 --> 20:49.580]  Okay.
[20:49.860 --> 20:50.360]  What's the result?
[20:50.460 --> 20:51.640]  Are we living and dying by the poll?
[20:51.720 --> 20:52.520]  We're gonna live and die by the poll.
[20:52.900 --> 20:53.820]  What do you think?
[20:54.020 --> 20:54.880]  Ooh, I'm nervous.
[20:55.340 --> 20:57.560]  The poll you could've voted on if you watched this live.
[20:58.000 --> 20:59.660]  This was on Monday.
[21:00.880 --> 21:01.540]  Roost your teeth.
[21:02.140 --> 21:03.040]  The audience voted.
[21:05.200 --> 21:08.340]  73% said yes, open it.
[21:08.340 --> 21:08.600]  Fuck.
[21:08.800 --> 21:09.000]  Okay.
[21:09.660 --> 21:10.600]  Ooh, I'm nervous.
[21:10.980 --> 21:11.540]  You know what?
[21:12.000 --> 21:12.860]  We'll open it last.
[21:12.960 --> 21:13.240]  Yes!
[21:13.720 --> 21:14.660]  I love it!
[21:14.680 --> 21:15.360]  I love a tease!
[21:15.680 --> 21:16.200]  Look at that!
[21:16.320 --> 21:17.820]  That's making a show!
[21:17.820 --> 21:19.040]  My Barbies!
[21:19.860 --> 21:22.620]  Speaking of Barbies, Emily, we have something special for you.
[21:23.660 --> 21:25.320]  Giant Barbie trading cards.
[21:25.500 --> 21:25.780]  That's fun.
[21:26.180 --> 21:26.540]  Barbie!
[21:26.840 --> 21:27.260]  Barbie!
[21:27.400 --> 21:27.820]  Let's see what's up with these.
[21:27.840 --> 21:28.360]  That's so cool.
[21:28.440 --> 21:30.320]  Like the number two movie in America or whatever.
[21:30.440 --> 21:31.160]  Number one!
[21:31.300 --> 21:31.600]  No, no.
[21:31.760 --> 21:33.940]  Behind Blue Beetle?
[21:34.020 --> 21:34.380]  No way.
[21:34.420 --> 21:35.580]  There's no way.
[21:35.720 --> 21:37.460]  It's their opening weekend.
[21:37.800 --> 21:38.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[21:38.460 --> 21:40.380]  It's like the fourth week Barbie's been out.
[21:40.640 --> 21:43.960]  And they're like, guys, Barbie got knocked out by Blue Beetle.
[21:44.440 --> 21:44.880]  1990.
[21:44.880 --> 21:47.960]  Barbie plays tennis with Ken.
[21:48.100 --> 21:48.460]  Is that Ken?
[21:48.560 --> 21:49.200]  That's Ken.
[21:49.460 --> 21:50.680]  Do you think her hair's cool?
[21:51.100 --> 21:52.100]  Yeah, I think it's beautiful.
[21:52.280 --> 21:53.080]  I think it's perfect.
[21:54.020 --> 21:54.880]  Oh, here's 1988.
[21:56.040 --> 21:56.340]  Alan.
[21:56.460 --> 21:57.020]  That's Alan.
[21:57.260 --> 22:01.860]  I had an Alan and I thought he was definitely the one that I made my Barbies make out with.
[22:01.920 --> 22:02.820]  Because he was way cuter.
[22:03.040 --> 22:03.600]  He had brown hair.
[22:04.220 --> 22:04.680]  Oh, really?
[22:04.800 --> 22:05.660]  All your Barbies kissed Alan?
[22:06.160 --> 22:06.980]  All my Barbies.
[22:07.000 --> 22:07.380]  I have brown hair.
[22:07.400 --> 22:09.440]  All of these Barbies have made out with Alan.
[22:10.560 --> 22:11.360]  1984 Barbie.
[22:11.660 --> 22:12.380]  Is that Alan again?
[22:12.380 --> 22:13.700]  I think she's doing...
[22:13.700 --> 22:15.480]  I think anybody brunette is Alan.
[22:16.060 --> 22:16.760]  Oh, it's gotta be Ken.
[22:16.860 --> 22:18.140]  But it's just like brown-haired Ken.
[22:18.740 --> 22:19.720]  It's all... you know, who cares?
[22:19.780 --> 22:20.180]  It's just Ken.
[22:20.300 --> 22:20.760]  Yeah, exactly.
[22:21.080 --> 22:23.380]  The whole movie's about that.
[22:23.660 --> 22:25.800]  Island Fun Hut Barbie from 1988.
[22:25.900 --> 22:27.400]  Did you ever have Island Fun Hut Barbie?
[22:27.440 --> 22:27.840]  No.
[22:28.620 --> 22:28.980]  88.
[22:29.440 --> 22:30.740]  I got into...
[22:30.740 --> 22:31.740]  88, I was two years old.
[22:33.020 --> 22:35.120]  I was more like 90 Barbie.
[22:35.360 --> 22:36.020]  Superstar Barbie.
[22:36.140 --> 22:37.660]  Superstar Ken back from 1989.
[22:37.760 --> 22:38.100]  It's weird.
[22:38.120 --> 22:39.800]  We were talking about it on Anima earlier.
[22:39.920 --> 22:41.700]  It's weird that I have memories from the 80s.
[22:41.700 --> 22:42.080]  Yeah.
[22:42.380 --> 22:43.040]  But, like, I do.
[22:43.340 --> 22:44.280]  I have memories from the 70s.
[22:44.380 --> 22:44.920]  Right, right, right.
[22:45.180 --> 22:45.540]  That's...
[22:45.540 --> 22:46.060]  Not weird.
[22:46.220 --> 22:46.580]  That's...
[22:47.060 --> 22:47.420]  Right.
[22:49.120 --> 22:49.840]  She's beautiful.
[22:50.020 --> 22:50.780]  Look at her dress.
[22:51.040 --> 22:51.680]  She's like art.
[22:52.180 --> 22:54.160]  This is Barbie private collection fashion.
[22:54.280 --> 22:55.340]  Private collection.
[22:56.660 --> 22:57.760]  That might be...
[22:57.760 --> 22:58.360]  This is...
[22:58.360 --> 22:58.940]  I like this one.
[22:59.040 --> 22:59.980]  This seems like Dallas.
[23:00.260 --> 23:01.100]  Getting down to business.
[23:01.260 --> 23:02.000]  Day to night, Ken.
[23:02.240 --> 23:03.000]  Day to night, Barbie.
[23:03.200 --> 23:03.460]  Wow.
[23:04.100 --> 23:04.820]  Business Barbie.
[23:05.300 --> 23:06.000]  That looks like Dallas.
[23:06.540 --> 23:07.080]  That's like...
[23:07.080 --> 23:07.380]  That is.
[23:07.420 --> 23:08.920]  That's like Pamela and Bobby right there.
[23:09.180 --> 23:11.280]  Yeah, because Pamela going to work at The Store.
[23:11.280 --> 23:11.780]  The Store.
[23:11.840 --> 23:12.440]  That's where she works.
[23:12.920 --> 23:13.560]  They don't...
[23:13.560 --> 23:13.940]  They were like...
[23:13.940 --> 23:14.860]  She's like, I have to go get a job.
[23:14.940 --> 23:16.920]  I don't want to just stay home and plan parties.
[23:17.020 --> 23:17.980]  I want to go work at The Store.
[23:18.080 --> 23:18.980]  I like working at The Store.
[23:19.060 --> 23:20.340]  I love working at The Store.
[23:20.660 --> 23:21.000]  The Store.
[23:21.080 --> 23:22.020]  I need to keep this as a puzzle.
[23:22.180 --> 23:23.300]  Yeah, we'll try to...
[23:23.300 --> 23:24.000]  I want to make the puzzle.
[23:24.000 --> 23:25.400]  What we'll try to do is we'll try to build...
[23:25.880 --> 23:26.560]  Oh, that's fun.
[23:26.940 --> 23:27.040]  Yeah.
[23:27.040 --> 23:28.360]  Building a whole puzzle is a really cool idea.
[23:28.560 --> 23:31.660]  Barbie, in 1981, she played in the pool.
[23:32.020 --> 23:32.320]  Yeah.
[23:32.460 --> 23:33.680]  She simply...
[23:33.680 --> 23:34.020]  Dream pool.
[23:34.320 --> 23:35.520]  Simply played in the pool.
[23:35.740 --> 23:35.920]  Yeah.
[23:36.480 --> 23:36.820]  And then...
[23:36.820 --> 23:37.220]  Oh, here's...
[23:37.220 --> 23:38.660]  Everybody loves the Barbie dream house.
[23:39.420 --> 23:39.740]  1985.
[23:39.740 --> 23:41.260]  I will say...
[23:41.260 --> 23:41.380]  I didn't get that one.
[23:41.480 --> 23:42.120]  Glamour home.
[23:42.260 --> 23:45.340]  This is the best part of the stream because it's the only part that Gracie is watching
[23:45.340 --> 23:46.840]  and paying attention to what the cards are.
[23:48.720 --> 23:49.380]  Taking notes.
[23:49.400 --> 23:50.000]  She was like...
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.020]  She's been typing on her computer and then the Barbie cards happened.
[23:52.080 --> 23:52.700]  She went, oh!
[23:53.060 --> 23:53.420]  Yes.
[23:54.040 --> 23:56.000]  And then we have Wedding Day Midge.
[23:56.120 --> 23:56.320]  Oh!
[23:56.780 --> 23:56.980]  What?
[23:57.820 --> 24:00.780]  Midge is the one that gets married and has babies and stuff.
[24:01.100 --> 24:02.260]  Is Midge the one that got pregnant?
[24:02.560 --> 24:04.080]  Yeah, we just don't talk about it.
[24:04.240 --> 24:05.100]  Yeah, that was fun.
[24:05.100 --> 24:05.780]  But she's fine.
[24:05.960 --> 24:07.080]  But, yeah.
[24:07.340 --> 24:07.700]  Poor Midge.
[24:07.700 --> 24:10.500]  She's seen the Barbie movie twice now.
[24:10.660 --> 24:11.080]  Wow.
[24:11.360 --> 24:11.900]  Three times.
[24:12.020 --> 24:12.620]  Look at this.
[24:12.660 --> 24:13.140]  Cool Midge.
[24:13.240 --> 24:14.220]  This is going to be me.
[24:14.880 --> 24:15.880]  You're going to be the Midge?
[24:16.000 --> 24:16.920]  I'm going to be the love bride.
[24:17.220 --> 24:17.400]  Oh.
[24:17.620 --> 24:22.600]  In another homage to my sweet fiancée, I have...
[24:22.600 --> 24:23.480]  Oppenheimer cards.
[24:23.700 --> 24:23.880]  Yeah.
[24:24.260 --> 24:26.980]  I've tried to hit both of her two passions.
[24:27.140 --> 24:28.700]  Barbie and then the second one...
[24:31.640 --> 24:34.300]  I mean, it's the...
[24:34.300 --> 24:38.040]  If you want to hear more about Dallas, you can subscribe to SoAllRight.
[24:38.040 --> 24:39.800]  Sure there will be an episode about it.
[24:39.900 --> 24:40.140]  Here we go.
[24:40.200 --> 24:41.720]  This is J.R. Ewing.
[24:42.340 --> 24:43.060]  That's Ellie.
[24:43.100 --> 24:43.760]  That's Miss Ellie.
[24:44.100 --> 24:44.820]  That's Jock.
[24:45.400 --> 24:45.880]  That's her dad.
[24:46.000 --> 24:47.120]  That's Sue Ellen.
[24:47.240 --> 24:47.760]  Sue Ellen.
[24:47.920 --> 24:48.860]  That looks like Lucy.
[24:49.220 --> 24:51.140]  And then that's Bobby and Pamela in the background.
[24:51.180 --> 24:52.540]  Is that Pamela who works at the store?
[24:52.780 --> 24:53.620]  Pamela works at the store.
[24:53.620 --> 24:54.020]  Pamela works at the store.
[24:54.140 --> 24:57.880]  And Pamela is part of the rival family.
[24:58.500 --> 25:00.240]  But that's a big deal that Bobby married her.
[25:00.260 --> 25:00.320]  The Barnes.
[25:00.360 --> 25:01.040]  The Barnes.
[25:01.320 --> 25:02.340]  And they're just...
[25:02.340 --> 25:03.560]  And it all takes place in Dallas, huh?
[25:03.580 --> 25:03.800]  Yes.
[25:03.800 --> 25:04.340]  All the whole thing.
[25:04.340 --> 25:06.040]  And most of it takes place on South Fork.
[25:06.040 --> 25:11.200]  Pamela right now is in a mental institution because she can't have a baby and she lost her mind.
[25:11.240 --> 25:12.520]  Is it because of the store?
[25:12.840 --> 25:13.160]  No.
[25:13.240 --> 25:13.340]  Oh.
[25:13.840 --> 25:14.900]  She's very sad.
[25:15.180 --> 25:18.500]  My love of Dallas started because of Geoff's SoAllRight podcast.
[25:18.680 --> 25:19.360]  He started talking about it.
[25:19.420 --> 25:20.580]  I was like, I'm going to watch the show from the beginning.
[25:20.900 --> 25:24.260]  If you want to be proud of where we have come as a society, watch a show from the 70s.
[25:24.380 --> 25:27.080]  It's a lot of like, ooh, not a lot of consent.
[25:27.960 --> 25:31.380]  It's a little underage, but it's just so good.
[25:31.440 --> 25:31.980]  I'm obsessed.
[25:32.340 --> 25:33.320]  Speaking of Bobby and...
[25:33.320 --> 25:34.020]  Is that Patrick Duffy?
[25:34.300 --> 25:34.640]  Pamela.
[25:34.640 --> 25:36.560]  That's Pamela and Bobby right there outside.
[25:36.900 --> 25:37.120]  South Fork.
[25:37.120 --> 25:39.720]  That's where they eat breakfast in the morning, outside by the pool.
[25:39.840 --> 25:41.140]  This is before he marries Suzanne.
[25:41.160 --> 25:46.280]  This is like second or third season when Pamela gets this fucking haircut.
[25:46.580 --> 25:50.000]  First and second season she had this beautiful hair and then she got this shag haircut.
[25:50.520 --> 25:50.620]  And then...
[25:50.620 --> 25:52.780]  So she's probably being like, Bobby, I have to go to work.
[25:53.060 --> 25:53.520]  At the store.
[25:53.880 --> 25:54.380]  At the store.
[25:54.460 --> 25:56.220]  Then at season four she gets a perm.
[25:56.880 --> 25:58.420]  And it's brutal.
[25:59.380 --> 25:59.520]  Bad.
[25:59.860 --> 26:00.620]  Oh, here we go.
[26:00.880 --> 26:01.560]  Femme fatale.
[26:01.880 --> 26:02.900]  This bitch.
[26:03.620 --> 26:04.020]  Kristen.
[26:04.280 --> 26:04.360]  Kristen.
[26:04.360 --> 26:05.980]  That is Sue Ellen's sister.
[26:06.200 --> 26:14.200]  J.R. Ewing's wife's sister, Kristen, she showed up, had sex with J.R., got knocked up, got murdered in a pool.
[26:14.400 --> 26:15.860]  Now that baby's out there somewhere.
[26:16.200 --> 26:16.520]  Maybe.
[26:16.740 --> 26:18.020]  We don't know what's happening with the baby.
[26:18.380 --> 26:19.080]  But yeah, she sucks.
[26:19.320 --> 26:20.900]  She is just out for money.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.420]  Also, they recast her between season two and season three.
[26:23.560 --> 26:23.760]  Yeah.
[26:24.060 --> 26:24.820]  This is a very different person.
[26:24.820 --> 26:26.420]  This is what it's like to live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area?
[26:26.520 --> 26:26.700]  Yeah.
[26:26.820 --> 26:27.480]  Damn, that's fucked up.
[26:27.480 --> 26:28.300]  She's dead as fuck.
[26:28.300 --> 26:28.920]  What a mess.
[26:29.400 --> 26:30.800]  She is dead as fuck.
[26:30.800 --> 26:31.200]  Here we go.
[26:31.200 --> 26:35.620]  This is that moment that Bobby and Pamela talk to a lady next door.
[26:35.720 --> 26:36.700]  That's Sue Ellen.
[26:36.720 --> 26:37.460]  Oh, that is Sue Ellen.
[26:37.580 --> 26:41.520]  That's probably Sue Ellen pregnant and drunk because she developed a drinking habit.
[26:41.900 --> 26:42.780]  Pregnant and drunk?
[26:42.900 --> 26:48.180]  She started drinking a lot when she got pregnant because she didn't know if it was Cliff Barnes' baby or J.R.'s baby.
[26:48.280 --> 26:50.720]  And she was just so miserable because she was with J.R.
[26:50.740 --> 26:54.480]  Because the whole show is justice for Sue Ellen because J.R. is such a piece of shit.
[26:54.900 --> 26:58.460]  So this is probably them being like, hey, Sue Ellen, what are you up to?
[26:58.500 --> 27:00.040]  And she's like, none of your business.
[27:00.280 --> 27:00.960]  And then goes inside.
[27:00.960 --> 27:01.560]  That was pretty good.
[27:01.580 --> 27:03.960]  She drank seven bottles of vodka.
[27:04.480 --> 27:13.100]  And then she goes to the doctor and the doctor's like, hey, there's been no scientific studies that have concluded that drinking is bad for pregnant women.
[27:13.900 --> 27:15.680]  But maybe dial it back a bit.
[27:15.860 --> 27:20.260]  And she goes, if you dare to tell me not to drink, I'll fire you and get another doctor.
[27:20.380 --> 27:22.140]  And the doctor's like, oh, no, no, please don't do that.
[27:22.500 --> 27:23.100]  Fucking wild.
[27:23.220 --> 27:24.220]  Don't fire me?
[27:24.300 --> 27:25.280]  Yeah, it was so wild.
[27:25.640 --> 27:26.340]  Oh, here we go.
[27:26.380 --> 27:26.900]  Here's Jock.
[27:27.120 --> 27:28.720]  That's the man that started it all right there.
[27:28.800 --> 27:29.440]  There he is.
[27:29.440 --> 27:31.720]  Yeah, he doesn't look like that in season five.
[27:32.120 --> 27:37.160]  No, well, he doesn't look like anything in season five because he's been off the show in Mexico for the whole season.
[27:37.360 --> 27:37.640]  South America.
[27:37.780 --> 27:41.140]  He's developing, he's teaching the people how to drill for oil there.
[27:41.680 --> 27:50.460]  We don't know if he's dead, the actor's dead, or in rehab, or what's going on, but he's been gone for about, I don't know, ten episodes now?
[27:50.640 --> 27:51.360]  The whole season.
[27:51.500 --> 27:51.700]  I love that.
[27:51.700 --> 27:52.720]  They just talk to him on the phone.
[27:52.840 --> 27:54.000]  But you don't hear him.
[27:54.180 --> 27:55.740]  You just hear their side of the phone call.
[27:55.840 --> 27:56.080]  Awesome.
[27:56.260 --> 27:56.680]  All right, daddy.
[27:57.160 --> 27:58.060]  All right, I'm on it.
[27:58.060 --> 28:00.140]  There's J.R. and Jock, daddy and son right there.
[28:00.140 --> 28:02.980]  That was when they went on a camping trip and they got shot.
[28:03.520 --> 28:09.580]  Yeah, they went on a camping trip and somebody recognized Jock and hates him, so he's like, I'm gonna get that son of a bitch this last thing I do.
[28:09.780 --> 28:11.560]  And J.R. was a bitch about it.
[28:11.760 --> 28:16.820]  It was really Ray and Bobby that shot back where J.R. was like, oh, daddy.
[28:17.300 --> 28:21.180]  Ray's the ranch hand who we find out in season three is Jock's illegitimate son.
[28:21.240 --> 28:25.040]  Who was sleeping with Jock's granddaughter, season one and two.
[28:25.200 --> 28:25.820]  So they're related?
[28:26.240 --> 28:27.680]  Yeah, they don't ever touch on that.
[28:27.680 --> 28:29.240]  Yeah, and she was like 15.
[28:29.400 --> 28:31.820]  Yeah, she seduced him instead of going to school.
[28:31.980 --> 28:34.820]  Here's a picture of, this is a stained picture.
[28:34.920 --> 28:38.160]  Stop watching this show! Stop watching this show!
[28:38.620 --> 28:41.060]  Oh, and then we'll end it on a fucking banger right here.
[28:42.060 --> 28:45.280]  This is, now this is a controversial figure in the Ramsey Hatfield household.
[28:45.540 --> 28:48.500]  Some people are big fans of this piece of shit.
[28:48.600 --> 28:49.520]  I don't like the way you say that.
[28:49.700 --> 28:51.180]  Some people are big fans of this piece of shit.
[28:51.260 --> 28:53.600]  Some people recognize that he is a grifting piece of shit.
[28:53.920 --> 28:54.140]  No!
[28:54.480 --> 28:55.320]  Cliff Barnes.
[28:55.320 --> 28:57.300]  Cliff Barnes, that is Pamela's brother.
[28:57.480 --> 28:59.100]  And he always gets a short end of the stick.
[29:00.240 --> 29:02.500]  He's the only one that is like a good guy.
[29:02.640 --> 29:04.400]  Who's like trying to take down J.R.
[29:04.500 --> 29:05.760]  I wanted him to be a good guy.
[29:05.780 --> 29:07.500]  That is his main focus is to take down J.R.
[29:07.960 --> 29:10.320]  But he's always just a little short on it.
[29:10.360 --> 29:11.640]  Pamela's brother. He sucks.
[29:11.980 --> 29:13.520]  I wanted him not to suck, but he does suck.
[29:13.800 --> 29:14.860]  You know, we're going to hold off on the rest.
[29:15.340 --> 29:17.540]  These are a gift that keeps on giving.
[29:17.840 --> 29:18.520]  Well, here's the thing.
[29:18.760 --> 29:19.880]  We do have that other mail thing.
[29:19.960 --> 29:20.480]  Do you want to get to that?
[29:20.500 --> 29:21.180]  Oh, right. Yeah, let's do that.
[29:21.220 --> 29:22.300]  Because this is insane.
[29:25.560 --> 29:28.340]  So this is somebody sent a thing.
[29:28.420 --> 29:29.820]  Okay to read on air. Thanks.
[29:30.700 --> 29:31.820]  Said, uh, wow!
[29:32.200 --> 29:32.640]  Do you have a wow?
[29:33.160 --> 29:35.140]  Oh, um, sorry.
[29:35.660 --> 29:36.160]  I have this.
[29:37.080 --> 29:37.480]  No.
[29:37.760 --> 29:38.060]  Sorry.
[29:38.620 --> 29:39.020]  Geoff!
[29:40.080 --> 29:42.340]  These cards are from my wife's uncle's extensive collection.
[29:42.520 --> 29:43.100]  He's dead.
[29:43.560 --> 29:45.160]  Uh, I've been helping...
[29:45.160 --> 29:47.000]  He said it differently, but that's essentially what it is.
[29:47.020 --> 29:48.340]  He said it in a more florid way.
[29:48.660 --> 29:51.220]  He's dead, and I'm trying to distribute everything.
[29:51.360 --> 29:53.180]  My wife recommended that I send some to you guys.
[29:53.240 --> 29:54.320]  Oh, that's a good...
[29:55.160 --> 29:56.340]  Smart. That was really smart.
[29:56.560 --> 29:58.780]  The first break shit inspired me to start collecting cards again.
[29:58.920 --> 30:00.080]  Well, that's awesome.
[30:00.380 --> 30:01.300]  I'm really happy to hear that.
[30:01.340 --> 30:04.980]  And I have amassed thousands of comic book cards since then.
[30:05.020 --> 30:05.640]  That's awesome, dude.
[30:05.960 --> 30:07.860]  Uh, thank you for rekindling my love of trading cards.
[30:07.900 --> 30:08.480]  The least we could do.
[30:08.700 --> 30:10.600]  And for the many laughs that...
[30:10.600 --> 30:11.640]  Face has provided.
[30:11.840 --> 30:13.000]  Scott. Thank you, Scott.
[30:13.060 --> 30:15.500]  That's the thing that I like about this show is that...
[30:16.140 --> 30:17.360]  I'm not into card collecting.
[30:17.560 --> 30:20.920]  This is fun, and I know there are a lot of people who want to get back into it and everything.
[30:21.180 --> 30:21.960]  What a great way to do it.
[30:22.220 --> 30:24.240]  Collect along with us while we make these insane things.
[30:24.240 --> 30:27.260]  Where we see Larry Hagman cards and stuff.
[30:27.560 --> 30:29.020]  Full box of 1991.
[30:29.200 --> 30:30.020]  Holy shit.
[30:30.340 --> 30:30.980]  Oh, my God.
[30:31.040 --> 30:32.440]  Fucking broken box of...
[30:33.900 --> 30:34.900]  Uh-oh.
[30:35.180 --> 30:36.920]  Yeah, 1991 score.
[30:38.260 --> 30:39.300]  They're everywhere.
[30:39.800 --> 30:40.680]  We'll open that pack.
[30:40.880 --> 30:43.180]  And then a box of hockey that's not even open yet.
[30:43.560 --> 30:44.740]  From Pro Set Hockey.
[30:45.380 --> 30:45.940]  From...
[30:45.940 --> 30:46.540]  Oh, it says French.
[30:46.660 --> 30:48.160]  Let's cards this do hockey.
[30:48.640 --> 30:49.780]  Let's cards this do hockey.
[30:50.120 --> 30:51.380]  Then 91 football.
[30:52.680 --> 30:54.780]  Then Fleer Ultra Base.
[30:54.860 --> 30:55.740]  These are fucking crazy.
[30:55.740 --> 30:56.160]  There's a lot.
[30:56.260 --> 30:56.920]  There's so much.
[30:57.000 --> 30:57.400]  But here's the thing.
[30:57.440 --> 30:58.420]  I don't know...
[30:58.420 --> 31:00.740]  We're going to open up a little bit of each.
[31:01.000 --> 31:01.700]  Dick Tracy.
[31:01.880 --> 31:02.260]  Those suck.
[31:02.420 --> 31:02.880]  That's awesome.
[31:03.240 --> 31:03.320]  Hook.
[31:03.840 --> 31:04.980]  Okay, so here's the thing.
[31:05.060 --> 31:05.340]  Oh, wow.
[31:05.400 --> 31:05.720]  Look at you.
[31:05.800 --> 31:06.420]  You're putting it together.
[31:06.680 --> 31:07.160]  That's pretty cool.
[31:08.840 --> 31:09.740]  I don't really know.
[31:09.880 --> 31:13.380]  We're just going to have to put these in pack sack form and figure out...
[31:14.200 --> 31:14.800]  In the pack sack form.
[31:14.800 --> 31:17.840]  Yeah, there's a lot that we can grab and pull.
[31:17.960 --> 31:19.160]  And we'll have to figure out where to keep these.
[31:19.240 --> 31:20.280]  Because, boy, you sent us a lot of cards.
[31:20.280 --> 31:20.980]  Thank you very much.
[31:21.020 --> 31:21.120]  You did.
[31:21.120 --> 31:21.860]  Thank you so much.
[31:21.980 --> 31:23.660]  You can send cards in.
[31:23.740 --> 31:28.200]  Send them to The Break Show, 1901 East 51st Street, Austin, Texas, 78723.
[31:28.700 --> 31:29.320]  Send them here.
[31:29.460 --> 31:30.400]  Just make sure you say Break Show.
[31:30.540 --> 31:32.020]  And then they put it under my mail thing.
[31:32.100 --> 31:32.880]  And then I go, Geoff, look.
[31:33.060 --> 31:34.180]  It's very exciting.
[31:34.320 --> 31:35.620]  I'm kind of bummed Gavin's not here for this one.
[31:35.640 --> 31:36.360]  He's a big Hook fan.
[31:36.420 --> 31:36.860]  Well, don't worry.
[31:36.940 --> 31:37.960]  There's probably more in here.
[31:38.020 --> 31:38.560]  Yeah, there are tons.
[31:38.780 --> 31:41.160]  Here's Robin Williams as Peter Pan.
[31:41.300 --> 31:42.700]  I believe he played in that movie.
[31:43.380 --> 31:45.380]  Here's Robin Williams as Peter Pan.
[31:47.560 --> 31:49.960]  Here we have Tootle's Secret.
[31:50.260 --> 31:50.780]  It's a lamp.
[31:51.140 --> 31:52.420]  Tootle's Secret was a lamp.
[31:52.560 --> 31:53.680]  He lost all his marbles.
[31:54.600 --> 31:56.200]  That's when they fell for it.
[31:56.240 --> 31:57.160]  The leader of the pack.
[31:57.560 --> 31:59.220]  And it was, I believe, probably Rufio.
[31:59.680 --> 32:00.120]  Rufi!
[32:00.640 --> 32:01.620]  Rufio, by the way.
[32:02.100 --> 32:02.960]  Dante Bosco.
[32:03.280 --> 32:04.860]  Long time friend of Rooster Teeth.
[32:05.080 --> 32:05.360]  Cool dude.
[32:05.540 --> 32:06.240]  Love him.
[32:06.800 --> 32:07.600]  Love Dante.
[32:07.620 --> 32:08.420]  Bosco heads, bro.
[32:08.640 --> 32:10.920]  Been in many things that we've produced here at the company.
[32:11.240 --> 32:12.260]  Tragic Transformation.
[32:14.200 --> 32:15.080]  Croc's Revenge.
[32:16.120 --> 32:17.580]  Tick tock, tick tock.
[32:18.460 --> 32:19.260]  Slingshot Hotshot.
[32:19.360 --> 32:20.700]  Nice, put him in the boob box, baby.
[32:21.300 --> 32:22.620]  Little Boy Lost.
[32:23.180 --> 32:23.500]  What?
[32:23.660 --> 32:24.400]  And then...
[32:24.400 --> 32:24.940]  I like that.
[32:25.320 --> 32:26.960]  This one's just like the title card.
[32:27.040 --> 32:27.260]  Hook.
[32:27.420 --> 32:28.700]  99 cards, 11 stickers.
[32:28.840 --> 32:29.840]  It's like an advertisement on the card.
[32:29.840 --> 32:31.140]  There's no shmi cards?
[32:31.460 --> 32:32.520]  No shmi this time.
[32:32.880 --> 32:33.500]  Show me shmi.
[32:33.500 --> 32:33.760]  The chase card.
[32:34.300 --> 32:35.000]  Show me shmi.
[32:35.140 --> 32:36.140]  Shmi would be the chase card.
[32:36.600 --> 32:37.940]  Let's do Dick Tracy now.
[32:37.940 --> 32:38.180]  Okay.
[32:38.760 --> 32:39.600]  Do you know that movie?
[32:39.900 --> 32:40.340]  No, go ahead.
[32:40.800 --> 32:41.320]  What were you gonna say?
[32:41.840 --> 32:42.380]  Oh, yeah.
[32:42.380 --> 32:45.560]  Do you know about the ownership, like the rights to this movie?
[32:46.840 --> 32:48.540]  Warren Beatty still owns the rights.
[32:49.120 --> 32:52.080]  And because he still owns the rights, he has to do a new thing with it.
[32:52.100 --> 32:53.300]  Otherwise, he'll lose rights to the IP.
[32:53.700 --> 32:56.260]  So what he does is he goes on TCM once every 10 years.
[32:56.660 --> 32:57.940]  There's something they do not advertise.
[32:58.200 --> 32:59.720]  They just put on it like 1130 at night.
[32:59.800 --> 33:04.080]  And it's him as Dick Tracy doing like an interview.
[33:04.160 --> 33:05.940]  You can find this like all online and everything.
[33:06.360 --> 33:08.920]  Where he's, it's Warren Beatty talking about it.
[33:08.920 --> 33:12.700]  And then it's like the last one they did was Ben Mankiewicz.
[33:12.940 --> 33:14.160]  And they're like talking to Warren Beatty.
[33:14.260 --> 33:15.540]  And they go, oh, what, we're being interrupted.
[33:15.680 --> 33:17.260]  And then it's Warren Beatty in like the hat.
[33:17.580 --> 33:18.680]  In like the Dick Tracy hat.
[33:18.760 --> 33:19.680]  And he just goes, hey.
[33:20.640 --> 33:21.500]  Hey, it's me.
[33:21.840 --> 33:22.500]  Keep the IP alive.
[33:22.600 --> 33:23.700]  Hey, it's me, Dick Tracy.
[33:24.040 --> 33:25.860]  And I don't know why.
[33:26.100 --> 33:29.120]  Because who the fuck wants this at all?
[33:29.120 --> 33:30.460]  I don't want to see this anymore.
[33:30.860 --> 33:31.220]  Wanted.
[33:32.320 --> 33:33.040]  The stooge.
[33:33.200 --> 33:36.880]  These are just, I hate Dick Tracy because it is all vile to look at.
[33:36.880 --> 33:40.500]  It is like real life garbage pail kids or whatever.
[33:40.660 --> 33:41.740]  That's true heart.
[33:41.860 --> 33:42.480]  I hate these.
[33:44.280 --> 33:46.220]  Do you put Dick Tracy in the...
[33:46.220 --> 33:47.340]  The interrogation.
[33:48.320 --> 33:51.420]  It was like this phase in the 90s where they did all these like weird movies.
[33:51.500 --> 33:53.640]  Where it was like Roger Rabbit and then the, what was the other duck one?
[33:54.000 --> 33:54.660]  Howard the Duck?
[33:54.780 --> 33:54.940]  Yeah.
[33:55.240 --> 33:59.960]  I think my problem with it is that this is everything that I hated about 90s movies.
[34:00.140 --> 34:04.680]  Where the budget was too big for something that was not creative enough.
[34:04.720 --> 34:04.940]  Yes.
[34:05.040 --> 34:06.000]  To warrant that budget.
[34:06.000 --> 34:06.480]  Absolutely.
[34:06.580 --> 34:10.140]  So everything is just makeup artists going, fucking more money?
[34:10.440 --> 34:11.600]  And then you get this.
[34:11.860 --> 34:13.020]  Owl Big Boy Caprice.
[34:14.040 --> 34:14.560]  Disgusting.
[34:14.740 --> 34:15.760]  On the Waterfront.
[34:15.820 --> 34:16.540]  That's a different movie.
[34:18.020 --> 34:19.540]  Terror in the Streets.
[34:20.900 --> 34:22.500]  A Hot Time for Tracy.
[34:23.460 --> 34:25.060]  It's just so gross.
[34:25.280 --> 34:26.660]  Tracy tracks his man.
[34:27.020 --> 34:27.880]  This sucks.
[34:27.980 --> 34:28.560]  These suck.
[34:28.860 --> 34:29.360]  Oh, here we go.
[34:29.580 --> 34:30.480]  A Confident Crook.
[34:30.860 --> 34:31.340]  There's Madonna.
[34:31.400 --> 34:31.800]  There's Madonna.
[34:31.880 --> 34:32.940]  The guy who is not Madonna.
[34:33.140 --> 34:34.540]  That's that guy from the other car.
[34:34.900 --> 34:35.540]  It's Al Pacino.
[34:35.680 --> 34:36.120]  Big Owl.
[34:36.180 --> 34:36.780]  That's Al Pacino?
[34:37.120 --> 34:38.700]  Is that not Al Pacino in the movie?
[34:38.840 --> 34:39.480]  I'm pretty sure it is.
[34:39.760 --> 34:40.020]  Probably.
[34:41.460 --> 34:43.040]  I'm pretty sure that's Al Pacino.
[34:43.360 --> 34:43.680]  Sick.
[34:43.860 --> 34:43.980]  Big Boy?
[34:44.220 --> 34:44.360]  Yeah.
[34:45.460 --> 34:47.900]  He's like the main villain or like one of the main villains in the movie.
[34:48.300 --> 34:48.880]  I hate it.
[34:49.120 --> 34:50.700]  It's disgusting to look at.
[34:51.880 --> 34:54.140]  Do you want to have a too disgusting to look at pile?
[34:54.340 --> 34:54.820]  Put that one there.
[34:54.820 --> 34:55.040]  Yeah.
[34:55.740 --> 34:56.880]  Oh, and then the first one too, right?
[34:57.300 --> 34:58.260]  Show me in the Inhuman.
[34:58.740 --> 34:59.380]  Yeah, there you go.
[34:59.660 --> 34:59.980]  Inhuman.
[35:00.220 --> 35:01.500]  Now we'll open up...
[35:01.500 --> 35:03.380]  This is going to be good because Eric is a huge Trekkie.
[35:03.380 --> 35:05.180]  We'll open up 1991 Star Trek cards.
[35:05.260 --> 35:05.820]  He's going to...
[35:05.820 --> 35:06.140]  25th anniversary.
[35:06.280 --> 35:08.040]  He's going to tell us everything that we know about Star Trek.
[35:08.040 --> 35:08.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:09.000 --> 35:10.940]  If there's one thing you know better than wrestling...
[35:10.940 --> 35:11.600]  Yeah, Star Trek.
[35:11.860 --> 35:12.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:13.420 --> 35:14.960]  Oh no, my Trek cards.
[35:17.500 --> 35:18.460]  Here we go.
[35:18.600 --> 35:19.260]  Dress uniform.
[35:19.480 --> 35:20.240]  That's Picard.
[35:20.360 --> 35:21.280]  Jean-Luc Picard.
[35:21.400 --> 35:22.020]  Yep, that's his name.
[35:22.040 --> 35:22.380]  Here he goes.
[35:22.460 --> 35:23.560]  Dr. Kate Pulaski.
[35:23.700 --> 35:24.600]  There's Pulaski.
[35:24.840 --> 35:26.240]  Everybody remembers her from...
[35:26.240 --> 35:27.880]  Yep, from those episodes of The Next Generation.
[35:28.340 --> 35:29.200]  Ryker and Data.
[35:29.320 --> 35:30.180]  Oh, he's a robot.
[35:30.520 --> 35:32.080]  Jonathan Frakes and Data.
[35:32.300 --> 35:32.480]  Yeah.
[35:32.840 --> 35:34.260]  Jonathan Frakes has like a broken back.
[35:34.580 --> 35:35.620]  Yeah, he like, he like broke...
[35:35.620 --> 35:36.020]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:36.120 --> 35:36.360]  Yes.
[35:37.380 --> 35:38.480]  Jonathan Frakes like broke his back
[35:38.480 --> 35:39.360]  and like when he sits in a chair.
[35:39.460 --> 35:39.900]  Do you know about that?
[35:40.000 --> 35:40.620]  Like him sitting in a chair?
[35:40.740 --> 35:41.240]  He sits like this.
[35:41.380 --> 35:41.920]  Go to the wide shot.
[35:44.000 --> 35:44.980]  He sits in a chair like this.
[35:45.140 --> 35:46.920]  He won't like come around and like sit.
[35:47.240 --> 35:47.800]  So he like...
[35:47.800 --> 35:48.400]  So he does this.
[35:52.490 --> 35:53.490]  And that's how he sits in a chair.
[35:53.630 --> 35:54.990]  What if it's a hot, tall back?
[35:55.630 --> 35:56.230]  What if it's a boot?
[35:56.410 --> 35:58.070]  He'll kind of like scoot and like hop.
[35:58.230 --> 35:58.390]  Yeah.
[35:58.590 --> 35:59.170]  Pretty weird, right?
[35:59.190 --> 35:59.770]  How did he break his back?
[35:59.850 --> 36:00.130]  I don't know.
[36:00.230 --> 36:00.990]  But I think that's what it was.
[36:01.030 --> 36:01.750]  I think it was a broken back.
[36:01.750 --> 36:02.990]  Probably exploring a planet.
[36:03.850 --> 36:04.710]  Here's the...
[36:04.710 --> 36:05.470]  Not the character, the man.
[36:05.710 --> 36:06.110]  The emissary.
[36:06.850 --> 36:08.910]  My favorite Brett Spiner thing is...
[36:08.910 --> 36:10.610]  Did you ever see that movie Trekkies?
[36:10.690 --> 36:11.930]  The documentary about Star Trek fans?
[36:12.030 --> 36:12.250]  No.
[36:12.550 --> 36:14.690]  In it, there's a woman who lives on the other side
[36:14.690 --> 36:17.610]  of a mountain from Brent Spiner in L.A.
[36:17.770 --> 36:19.650]  She just like knows roughly where his house is.
[36:20.110 --> 36:20.570]  And she's like,
[36:20.750 --> 36:22.350]  sometimes I'll sit on my back porch
[36:22.350 --> 36:24.130]  and I'll just drink my coffee
[36:24.130 --> 36:25.830]  and I'll stare at that mountain and I'll think,
[36:26.090 --> 36:27.610]  I wonder what Brent's doing right now.
[36:28.130 --> 36:29.290]  No, I don't like that.
[36:29.590 --> 36:30.170]  And I was like,
[36:30.170 --> 36:31.890]  whoa, the emissary.
[36:32.230 --> 36:32.450]  Woof.
[36:32.530 --> 36:33.850]  And there's Turbo Lift.
[36:34.170 --> 36:34.730]  Hey, it's Q!
[36:34.910 --> 36:35.830]  Oh, that's Q,
[36:36.210 --> 36:38.830]  who also played Eugene in Days of Our Lives.
[36:38.910 --> 36:39.770]  Great character actor.
[36:39.850 --> 36:40.650]  Great character actor.
[36:41.710 --> 36:42.870]  Speaking of a great character actor,
[36:43.110 --> 36:43.350]  Family.
[36:45.670 --> 36:47.470]  This head looks lumpy and weird in that.
[36:47.470 --> 36:48.070]  It's been so long.
[36:48.230 --> 36:49.330]  It's an odd angle.
[36:49.410 --> 36:50.850]  He stayed in the birth canal too long.
[36:52.570 --> 36:53.530]  Hollow Pursuits.
[36:53.750 --> 36:53.990]  Nice.
[36:54.650 --> 36:55.750]  The High Ground.
[36:56.870 --> 36:59.490]  That moment from Star Trek when Anakin
[36:59.490 --> 37:01.570]  was at the bottom of the...
[37:02.570 --> 37:03.510]  I hate you!
[37:04.050 --> 37:05.930]  Dr. Beverly Crusher was on the top.
[37:06.130 --> 37:07.310]  And she had two lightsabers.
[37:07.370 --> 37:08.550]  She's like, Luke, I have the High Ground.
[37:09.150 --> 37:10.410]  Anakin, yeah, was the whole thing.
[37:10.530 --> 37:11.130]  Well, she called him Luke,
[37:11.190 --> 37:11.710]  it didn't make any sense.
[37:11.710 --> 37:12.730]  The Survivors.
[37:13.850 --> 37:14.670]  Way upside down.
[37:15.030 --> 37:15.550]  Q who?
[37:16.510 --> 37:17.270]  Is he a Borg?
[37:17.370 --> 37:18.530]  That's Q the Borg, I guess.
[37:18.550 --> 37:20.430]  I don't remember a Borg Q, but all right.
[37:21.610 --> 37:22.290]  Final Mission.
[37:23.490 --> 37:24.570]  Is that Wesley Crusher?
[37:24.630 --> 37:25.250]  I guess so.
[37:27.830 --> 37:29.410]  No idea what happened to him.
[37:29.490 --> 37:30.950]  Nobody knows what happened to him after Star Trek.
[37:31.510 --> 37:32.710]  He just disappeared off the planet.
[37:32.870 --> 37:33.590]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[37:33.790 --> 37:35.110]  I'm not inundated with him.
[37:35.590 --> 37:36.490]  Troy and Crusher.
[37:37.070 --> 37:37.930]  There they are, both of them.
[37:37.950 --> 37:38.310]  There you go.
[37:38.370 --> 37:40.930]  You put that picture online, people go crazy for it in 1994, man.
[37:41.030 --> 37:43.090]  Everybody remembers Star Trek.
[37:43.310 --> 37:43.750]  Okay, there we go.
[37:43.770 --> 37:44.230]  Here we go.
[37:44.890 --> 37:47.550]  Series 2, score 1991 baseball.
[37:47.770 --> 37:48.410]  Potential Zim?
[37:48.810 --> 37:50.690]  Win special Mickey Mantle cards.
[37:51.370 --> 37:52.250]  Potentials, I don't know.
[37:52.310 --> 37:52.530]  No?
[37:52.690 --> 37:53.230]  I don't know.
[37:53.570 --> 37:55.870]  Maybe Kirby Puckett.
[37:57.830 --> 37:58.890]  But you're not thinking of Zim?
[37:59.490 --> 38:00.710]  No, there won't be a Zimmer in here.
[38:00.790 --> 38:00.930]  Okay.
[38:01.610 --> 38:02.250]  Rainey Myers.
[38:03.410 --> 38:04.050]  Storm Davis.
[38:04.470 --> 38:04.750]  Great name.
[38:06.090 --> 38:06.830]  It is a great name.
[38:06.850 --> 38:07.750]  It's a great baseball name, right?
[38:08.030 --> 38:10.910]  I think it would be like a weather guy, but I don't know if weather guy is going to be
[38:10.910 --> 38:11.570]  broad enough, you know?
[38:11.690 --> 38:12.690]  Glenn Allen Hill.
[38:13.530 --> 38:14.170]  Don Robinson.
[38:15.570 --> 38:16.210]  Ron Robinson.
[38:16.850 --> 38:17.510]  Ooh, here we go.
[38:18.450 --> 38:19.090]  Ron Robinson.
[38:19.410 --> 38:19.890]  What did I say?
[38:20.130 --> 38:20.450]  Don.
[38:20.610 --> 38:21.210]  Don Robinson.
[38:21.650 --> 38:22.670]  I got Don Zimmer on the right.
[38:22.690 --> 38:23.110]  Ooh, what is that?
[38:23.270 --> 38:23.530]  A little trivia.
[38:24.930 --> 38:25.250]  1923.
[38:25.430 --> 38:25.630]  That's neat.
[38:26.030 --> 38:26.330]  Let's see.
[38:27.270 --> 38:28.230]  Casey Conkers.
[38:28.270 --> 38:29.250]  1923 World Series.
[38:29.730 --> 38:30.150]  Whatever.
[38:30.870 --> 38:32.450]  Okay, Ed Whitson.
[38:32.550 --> 38:32.770]  Wow.
[38:32.990 --> 38:33.650]  John Cerruti.
[38:33.850 --> 38:34.710]  Geoff Kunkel.
[38:36.890 --> 38:38.590]  Would that be a pussy slay?
[38:39.110 --> 38:39.630]  Yeah.
[38:40.250 --> 38:40.590]  Man.
[38:40.790 --> 38:41.430]  It should be something.
[38:41.910 --> 38:42.510]  Let me see.
[38:42.990 --> 38:43.590]  Curt Schilling.
[38:44.270 --> 38:44.570]  No.
[38:46.690 --> 38:47.590]  Name is currency.
[38:47.930 --> 38:48.970]  I mean, he just...
[38:48.970 --> 38:49.570]  What's his deal?
[38:50.650 --> 38:55.030]  He made a lot of money in baseball, and he started a video game company.
[38:55.170 --> 38:55.470]  Uh-huh.
[38:56.070 --> 38:57.690]  And he made a video game.
[38:57.750 --> 38:57.930]  Uh-huh.
[38:58.110 --> 38:58.850]  And it was not bad.
[38:59.170 --> 38:59.630]  What was it?
[38:59.730 --> 39:00.570]  It didn't do particularly well.
[39:00.810 --> 39:01.130]  Mm-hmm.
[39:01.210 --> 39:04.130]  And then he lost his mind and all of his money and got a little weird.
[39:04.650 --> 39:04.950]  Really?
[39:05.290 --> 39:05.570]  Yeah.
[39:05.770 --> 39:05.950]  Right?
[39:06.030 --> 39:06.830]  Got a little...
[39:06.830 --> 39:11.330]  You know how sometimes you make a decision when you're driving down the road and you take a hard right?
[39:12.230 --> 39:12.570]  Okay.
[39:12.730 --> 39:13.430]  That's kind of what he did.
[39:13.570 --> 39:14.530]  Like a hard right?
[39:14.770 --> 39:16.350]  Like a real hard right.
[39:16.370 --> 39:18.050]  Like a real hard right.
[39:18.150 --> 39:19.070]  Like a real hard right.
[39:19.270 --> 39:20.230]  Like a supreme right.
[39:20.530 --> 39:20.870]  Yeah.
[39:21.030 --> 39:21.770]  Mike Simms.
[39:21.810 --> 39:22.250]  Ricky Cross.
[39:22.610 --> 39:23.330]  Oh, here you go.
[39:23.330 --> 39:24.030]  Benito Santiago.
[39:24.510 --> 39:24.870]  Hey!
[39:25.250 --> 39:25.830]  That's cute.
[39:26.190 --> 39:27.390]  That's my rookie of the year baby.
[39:27.910 --> 39:28.410]  That's my boy.
[39:28.650 --> 39:29.350]  My all-star.
[39:29.490 --> 39:29.990]  Do you want me to say him?
[39:29.990 --> 39:30.210]  Benny.
[39:30.290 --> 39:31.070]  It's not worth anything, but it's cute.
[39:31.070 --> 39:31.930]  No, but it's a cool card.
[39:32.010 --> 39:32.510]  It's a cool card.
[39:32.550 --> 39:32.990]  I like Benny.
[39:33.310 --> 39:33.950]  Eric likes it.
[39:34.050 --> 39:34.830]  I like Benny Bighead.
[39:36.210 --> 39:36.930]  Donovan Osborne.
[39:37.090 --> 39:37.330]  Uh-huh.
[39:37.570 --> 39:38.170]  What a...
[39:38.170 --> 39:39.350]  That guy looks like a dumbass.
[39:39.490 --> 39:39.910]  Yeah, he does.
[39:41.530 --> 39:42.250]  Mike Lieberthal.
[39:42.590 --> 39:43.450]  Oh, that's a dumbass.
[39:43.450 --> 39:45.250]  What the fuck kind of pictures are these?
[39:45.490 --> 39:46.110]  Not good ones.
[39:46.170 --> 39:46.430]  No.
[39:46.670 --> 39:47.450]  Mitch Webster.
[39:47.550 --> 39:47.770]  Okay.
[39:47.970 --> 39:48.990]  Juan Augusto.
[39:49.070 --> 39:49.250]  Okay.
[39:49.570 --> 39:50.610]  Danny Jackson.
[39:50.610 --> 39:51.730]  What is that?
[39:51.830 --> 39:52.310]  I don't...
[39:52.310 --> 39:52.590]  What...
[39:52.590 --> 39:56.070]  His arm angle and his leg angle is so...
[39:57.070 --> 39:57.470]  How...
[39:57.470 --> 39:58.470]  He looks like he's tripping.
[39:58.610 --> 39:59.390]  He's like...
[39:59.390 --> 40:00.450]  How is he...
[40:00.450 --> 40:00.790]  It's...
[40:00.790 --> 40:01.790]  It's something...
[40:01.790 --> 40:03.330]  His arm's like...
[40:03.330 --> 40:04.410]  I don't know...
[40:04.410 --> 40:05.730]  How's he doing that?
[40:05.830 --> 40:06.610]  Like, he looks...
[40:07.950 --> 40:08.590]  That weird...
[40:08.590 --> 40:09.530]  You know what?
[40:09.570 --> 40:10.090]  I don't know how to...
[40:10.090 --> 40:11.910]  His glove is like upside down all...
[40:11.910 --> 40:12.890]  Like, it's all just fucked.
[40:12.970 --> 40:14.190]  I don't know how to say it without being insulting.
[40:14.250 --> 40:14.950]  Yeah, it's all just like...
[40:14.950 --> 40:15.390]  He...
[40:15.390 --> 40:16.010]  It's...
[40:16.010 --> 40:16.730]  He's special.
[40:17.130 --> 40:17.910]  He looks all fucked.
[40:18.330 --> 40:19.290]  Adam Peterson.
[40:19.290 --> 40:19.990]  There you go.
[40:20.190 --> 40:20.350]  Huh.
[40:20.670 --> 40:21.290]  These cards suck.
[40:21.390 --> 40:21.970]  They weren't great.
[40:22.250 --> 40:22.570]  These...
[40:22.570 --> 40:24.730]  I'm very curious to see what we can get out of this.
[40:25.050 --> 40:26.250]  Out of, like, these packs that...
[40:26.250 --> 40:26.830]  Was it Scott?
[40:27.130 --> 40:27.350]  Yeah.
[40:27.530 --> 40:28.250]  Sent us 100,000 of?
[40:28.370 --> 40:29.390]  So, I'm very curious.
[40:30.130 --> 40:31.090]  Do you want to see if there's anything else down there?
[40:31.170 --> 40:31.910]  Let's do one of these...
[40:31.910 --> 40:32.310]  You know what?
[40:32.370 --> 40:32.670]  We don't...
[40:32.670 --> 40:33.690]  We don't open football often.
[40:33.710 --> 40:34.170]  God, yeah.
[40:34.170 --> 40:34.790]  You know why?
[40:37.150 --> 40:37.470]  Fucking...
[40:37.470 --> 40:38.370]  Alright, here we go.
[40:38.390 --> 40:38.970]  It's a fat pack.
[40:39.110 --> 40:39.810]  1991 score.
[40:39.970 --> 40:40.330]  Series one.
[40:40.410 --> 40:41.110]  NFL football.
[40:42.110 --> 40:43.150]  Special consumer offer.
[40:43.530 --> 40:45.550]  You love to be called a consumer on the...
[40:46.210 --> 40:47.110]  Not special offer.
[40:47.170 --> 40:48.090]  Hey, what's up, you mark?
[40:48.170 --> 40:48.810]  Hey, consumer.
[40:49.910 --> 40:50.710]  Buy more.
[40:51.730 --> 40:52.690]  Do you love content?
[40:52.890 --> 40:55.030]  I don't even know what would be a 91 football rookie.
[40:55.090 --> 40:55.250]  Nope.
[40:55.710 --> 40:57.270]  Maybe Christian Akoya or something.
[40:57.390 --> 40:58.030]  Nick Lowry.
[40:58.210 --> 40:59.170]  Tim Brown.
[41:00.910 --> 41:01.710]  Mike Merriweather.
[41:02.030 --> 41:02.110]  Hey.
[41:03.390 --> 41:04.190]  Randall Cunningham.
[41:04.610 --> 41:05.310]  There you go.
[41:05.410 --> 41:05.610]  Alright.
[41:05.670 --> 41:06.670]  Ooh, Barry Sanders.
[41:06.910 --> 41:08.090]  I could probably sleeve that.
[41:08.170 --> 41:08.350]  Okay.
[41:08.870 --> 41:10.310]  Oh, this is nice.
[41:10.770 --> 41:13.610]  Here's a dream team defensive end, Bruce Smith.
[41:14.210 --> 41:14.610]  Wow.
[41:14.770 --> 41:15.430]  Is he not wearing a shirt?
[41:16.130 --> 41:16.730]  That's a...
[41:16.730 --> 41:17.430]  No, he's not wearing a shirt.
[41:17.430 --> 41:18.390]  That's like a...
[41:18.390 --> 41:18.890]  Should we...
[41:18.890 --> 41:20.550]  Do we have a section for glamour shots?
[41:21.250 --> 41:22.570]  Would that be Pussy Slay?
[41:22.670 --> 41:23.650]  That's pretty hard.
[41:24.190 --> 41:24.430]  Oh, that one?
[41:24.730 --> 41:25.170]  Absolutely.
[41:25.170 --> 41:26.510]  He's like, you up?
[41:26.730 --> 41:26.910]  Yep.
[41:27.190 --> 41:27.650]  You up?
[41:28.150 --> 41:29.050]  Here's a body part.
[41:29.250 --> 41:30.110]  Fame gash.
[41:30.710 --> 41:31.210]  Okay.
[41:31.450 --> 41:32.430]  That's not...
[41:33.210 --> 41:34.850]  Which part of the body is that?
[41:34.970 --> 41:35.290]  Yeah.
[41:36.230 --> 41:36.950]  The vagina.
[41:38.670 --> 41:39.190]  Right?
[41:40.030 --> 41:40.710]  A gash?
[41:40.990 --> 41:41.510]  It's a...
[41:41.510 --> 41:43.490]  It was a horrible insult when I was in high school.
[41:43.830 --> 41:44.710]  That people would say...
[41:45.230 --> 41:50.430]  Some guy called a girl in my class a gash, and she told her dad.
[41:50.630 --> 41:52.550]  And her dad was at school the next day.
[41:52.850 --> 41:54.490]  And they had to stop him from beating the shit out of the kid.
[41:54.710 --> 41:55.450]  Oh my god.
[41:55.510 --> 41:57.330]  Yeah, that's like not a word that people use.
[41:57.390 --> 41:58.390]  No, it's terrible.
[41:58.470 --> 41:59.170]  I think you just brought it back.
[41:59.290 --> 42:00.750]  I'm not trying to, I'm just saying that.
[42:00.870 --> 42:01.670]  I just read what I saw.
[42:02.070 --> 42:02.790]  Shane Collins.
[42:03.910 --> 42:04.630]  Wyman Henderson.
[42:05.970 --> 42:06.470]  That's a...
[42:06.470 --> 42:06.950]  Wyman?
[42:07.450 --> 42:08.030]  That's cool.
[42:08.310 --> 42:10.870]  Oh man, the old Broncos logo sucks.
[42:10.990 --> 42:11.390]  It's great.
[42:12.890 --> 42:13.610]  Scott Mercereau.
[42:14.630 --> 42:15.350]  Tim McGee.
[42:16.390 --> 42:17.110]  Johnny Johnson.
[42:17.930 --> 42:18.050]  What?
[42:18.810 --> 42:19.530]  Mike Young.
[42:20.090 --> 42:21.410]  That looks like he's about to get hit in the face.
[42:21.430 --> 42:23.190]  The balls are walking his face.
[42:23.310 --> 42:24.010]  Fucking Oilers.
[42:24.370 --> 42:25.090]  Curtis Duncan.
[42:25.450 --> 42:25.670]  Nice.
[42:25.790 --> 42:26.050]  Here we go.
[42:26.150 --> 42:26.870]  This one works.
[42:27.530 --> 42:28.250]  Louis Lips.
[42:28.650 --> 42:29.510]  Oh, that's the body part.
[42:30.030 --> 42:30.510]  Yeah, that's a good one.
[42:31.070 --> 42:31.970]  But what body part?
[42:32.970 --> 42:33.670]  Eric Green.
[42:34.030 --> 42:34.390]  Gash.
[42:34.870 --> 42:35.390]  Let me see that.
[42:35.570 --> 42:36.050]  Oh, here he is.
[42:36.230 --> 42:36.690]  He's right there.
[42:37.210 --> 42:47.690]  So far we have a Dickie, Lips, Assmancher, Bush, Dick, Willie, Randy Bush, and then Howard Johnson.
[42:47.870 --> 42:48.490]  These are pretty good.
[42:48.610 --> 42:49.850]  These are all of our body parts.
[42:50.130 --> 42:50.710]  Oh, what's this?
[42:50.850 --> 42:53.650]  This is 1991... or 19... what?
[42:54.690 --> 42:56.970]  2020-2021 Optic Basketball.
[42:57.150 --> 42:57.570]  What the fuck?
[42:57.570 --> 42:58.190]  These are older.
[42:58.550 --> 43:01.690]  I just... I got these cheaply online, so I bought a bunch.
[43:01.730 --> 43:04.950]  You got them cheaply because there's like nothing in it, or is it cheaply just because...
[43:04.950 --> 43:05.610]  They were just on sale.
[43:05.610 --> 43:06.550]  I found a deal.
[43:06.690 --> 43:06.810]  Cool.
[43:07.050 --> 43:08.590]  It's hard to find deals on this kind of stuff.
[43:08.750 --> 43:10.290]  That's what I asked.
[43:10.710 --> 43:12.930]  I figured there's probably like not a lot of that.
[43:13.150 --> 43:13.690]  Alright, here we go.
[43:14.630 --> 43:16.430]  2021 NBA, we're looking for who?
[43:16.550 --> 43:16.910]  Let's do it, baby.
[43:17.150 --> 43:19.270]  We're looking for Anthony Edwards and Lamello Ball, probably.
[43:19.450 --> 43:20.250]  Oh, yeah, baby.
[43:20.890 --> 43:22.270]  My two favorite players.
[43:23.350 --> 43:24.030]  Let's see.
[43:24.610 --> 43:25.290]  Laurie Markkinen.
[43:25.550 --> 43:26.770]  Boy, he turned into a star, didn't he?
[43:27.270 --> 43:27.610]  KPJ.
[43:28.430 --> 43:29.530]  Theo Maladon, rookie.
[43:29.670 --> 43:30.110]  That's nice.
[43:30.390 --> 43:31.210]  We'll just leave that.
[43:31.310 --> 43:31.830]  Oh, here we go.
[43:32.170 --> 43:33.350]  It's a fucking story of my life, dude.
[43:33.730 --> 43:34.830]  It's a story of my fucking life.
[43:34.830 --> 43:38.830]  I get so many goddamn Luke Kinnard prisms.
[43:39.530 --> 43:40.370]  This is a silver prism.
[43:40.930 --> 43:42.590]  I get so many goddamn Luke Kinnard prisms.
[43:42.690 --> 43:44.370]  I got a Luke Kinnard autograph the other day.
[43:44.710 --> 43:44.790]  Really?
[43:45.050 --> 43:49.150]  I'm building out the biggest Luke Kinnard collection of cards I didn't want to buy.
[43:49.150 --> 43:52.070]  So it's gonna be like Marcus Smart and the number two Luke Kinnard.
[43:52.490 --> 43:52.690]  Luke Kinnard, yeah.
[43:52.710 --> 43:53.110]  That's pretty cool.
[43:53.330 --> 43:55.910]  Dude, I have so many high-value Luke Kinnard.
[43:55.910 --> 43:59.230]  That's like, I've seen like in person, I've seen like Padres games the most,
[43:59.310 --> 44:03.350]  but second most I've definitely seen Arizona Diamondbacks just because they were playing the Padres,
[44:03.350 --> 44:05.490]  and I just kept fucking going to Arizona Diamondbacks games.
[44:05.730 --> 44:06.890]  Fucking hate the Diamondbacks.
[44:06.910 --> 44:07.790]  Sucks how that works, doesn't it?
[44:08.070 --> 44:10.370]  Josh Richardson played for the Celtics for a brief moment.
[44:10.650 --> 44:13.370]  Ricky Rubio, taking a break from basketball.
[44:13.370 --> 44:14.030]  Very interesting.
[44:14.030 --> 44:14.930]  A little mental health break.
[44:15.070 --> 44:15.830]  Yeah, I don't blame him.
[44:16.130 --> 44:19.570]  Diddy Avija, he is an Israeli basketball player.
[44:19.770 --> 44:20.350]  We'll just leave that.
[44:20.830 --> 44:24.350]  And then here's a purple rookie prism parallel Jaden McDaniels.
[44:24.890 --> 44:25.810]  That's a nice card.
[44:25.870 --> 44:26.330]  Yeah, that's a good looking one.
[44:26.330 --> 44:28.710]  You see how we already have two absolute hits?
[44:28.850 --> 44:28.950]  Yeah.
[44:29.630 --> 44:32.010]  That's what we don't get with the goddamn Monopoly.
[44:32.010 --> 44:33.450]  The Monopoly cards are just duds.
[44:33.590 --> 44:34.170]  They're just duds.
[44:34.230 --> 44:34.670]  That's rough.
[44:35.210 --> 44:37.070]  Maybe, you think, call it on the Monopoly cards then?
[44:37.130 --> 44:37.930]  Do you gotta stop getting those?
[44:38.130 --> 44:39.770]  I gotta... I'm gonna keep buying more if I can.
[44:40.270 --> 44:41.430]  Steph Curry base.
[44:42.330 --> 44:43.150]  Seth Curry base.
[44:43.210 --> 44:44.670]  What are the odds you get Seth for Seth?
[44:44.990 --> 44:45.430]  Wait, wait, wait.
[44:45.570 --> 44:49.470]  We need Seth Curry because we have Steph Curry and we have their dad.
[44:49.770 --> 44:51.990]  We need a Seth Curry for our food.
[44:51.990 --> 44:52.850]  There you go, put them together.
[44:52.970 --> 44:54.330]  It's for our food one.
[44:54.370 --> 44:54.670]  Oh yeah, Seth Curry.
[44:55.050 --> 44:55.510]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:55.510 --> 44:57.970]  So we have a bunch...
[44:57.970 --> 44:58.690]  Del Curry.
[44:58.710 --> 45:01.690]  Del Curry and Seth Curry and now we have Seth Curry.
[45:01.690 --> 45:02.570]  I'm gonna put...
[45:02.570 --> 45:05.090]  And if we had a Taco Fall card, we could have a Del Taco.
[45:05.570 --> 45:07.450]  We could start making restaurants.
[45:07.830 --> 45:08.110]  Restaurants?
[45:08.670 --> 45:09.770]  We'll have to try to get a Taco Fall card.
[45:10.110 --> 45:11.670]  Call me if we get a Jack in the Box.
[45:11.930 --> 45:12.450]  Oh my God.
[45:13.150 --> 45:14.350]  We can make a Jack in the Box.
[45:14.410 --> 45:15.570]  We just need somebody whose last name is Box.
[45:15.590 --> 45:16.330]  Yeah, we're almost there.
[45:16.870 --> 45:17.690]  Jemias Ramsey rookie.
[45:17.810 --> 45:18.190]  That's okay.
[45:18.630 --> 45:20.450]  And then Steph Curry, my house, parallel.
[45:20.650 --> 45:21.830]  Very badly misjudged.
[45:21.830 --> 45:21.850]  Why?
[45:21.930 --> 45:23.870]  There were three Currys in that pack of four cards.
[45:23.890 --> 45:24.690]  Why is he like...
[45:25.330 --> 45:26.050]  Why is he doing like a...
[45:26.050 --> 45:26.910]  It's like he's like...
[45:26.910 --> 45:27.610]  It's like he's...
[45:27.610 --> 45:28.270]  What is it?
[45:28.290 --> 45:28.630]  What is it?
[45:29.330 --> 45:29.910]  Spider-Man does?
[45:29.910 --> 45:30.450]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:30.490 --> 45:31.810]  Thwip, thwip, thwip, thwip, thwip, thwip.
[45:31.930 --> 45:32.490]  My house.
[45:32.670 --> 45:33.330]  Thwip, thwip, thwip, thwip, thwip.
[45:34.350 --> 45:34.990]  Skeet, skeet.
[45:35.730 --> 45:36.370]  No, that's different.
[45:36.610 --> 45:37.130]  Totally different.
[45:37.730 --> 45:39.350]  Next, we're going to open up these because I like these.
[45:39.490 --> 45:40.890]  2022 Chrome Platinum.
[45:40.970 --> 45:42.950]  Also, don't forget, stick around.
[45:43.070 --> 45:46.310]  In about less than 15 minutes, we're going to open this insane card
[45:46.310 --> 45:47.510]  that you guys voted that we're going to open.
[45:47.810 --> 45:48.410]  Are you sure?
[45:48.650 --> 45:49.370]  Yeah, I have to.
[45:49.430 --> 45:50.050]  The audience picked.
[45:50.070 --> 45:50.690]  I don't know.
[45:51.110 --> 45:52.890]  And they're watching live on Rooster Teeth.
[45:53.190 --> 45:54.570]  They'll be upset if we don't.
[45:55.250 --> 45:57.490]  Let's throw one of these in the pack sack to be true.
[45:58.810 --> 45:59.690]  All right.
[45:59.950 --> 46:00.290]  2022.
[46:00.610 --> 46:01.110]  Tops Chrome.
[46:01.270 --> 46:01.490]  Parallel.
[46:01.590 --> 46:03.110]  These are gorgeous cards.
[46:03.330 --> 46:03.890]  What are we looking for here?
[46:04.310 --> 46:04.750]  I don't know.
[46:05.010 --> 46:05.570]  Just hits.
[46:05.750 --> 46:06.030]  2022.
[46:06.290 --> 46:06.630]  2022.
[46:07.170 --> 46:08.110]  Here's Randy Johnson.
[46:08.350 --> 46:09.230]  Diamondbacks Randy Johnson.
[46:10.270 --> 46:11.730]  Here's Jack Flaherty.
[46:13.090 --> 46:13.970]  Albert Pujols.
[46:15.430 --> 46:16.310]  That looks...
[46:16.310 --> 46:18.390]  It looks like they drew on his beard later.
[46:18.870 --> 46:19.690]  Brian Miller.
[46:19.830 --> 46:20.250]  Rookie.
[46:20.410 --> 46:20.970]  Don't know who that is.
[46:21.930 --> 46:22.670]  Ooh, Zach Thompson.
[46:22.850 --> 46:23.130]  Blue.
[46:23.510 --> 46:23.770]  That's nice.
[46:23.950 --> 46:24.570]  Some kind of parallel.
[46:25.650 --> 46:26.690]  So we'll sleeve those.
[46:29.110 --> 46:30.730]  I probably won't open all the packs here.
[46:30.830 --> 46:32.690]  I'll probably just open a couple and save the rest.
[46:33.290 --> 46:34.970]  Here we go with Glenn Otto.
[46:35.470 --> 46:36.230]  Oh, shit.
[46:37.010 --> 46:37.450]  What we got?
[46:37.530 --> 46:38.050]  Turn that around.
[46:38.070 --> 46:38.450]  Did that last.
[46:38.690 --> 46:40.030]  Here's C.J. Abrams.
[46:40.170 --> 46:40.650]  Base rookie.
[46:40.830 --> 46:42.450]  That was a hot card two years ago.
[46:42.490 --> 46:44.390]  Yes, it was, but now he's international.
[46:45.410 --> 46:46.210]  Larry Dobby.
[46:46.690 --> 46:47.050]  Nice.
[46:47.650 --> 46:49.330]  Ooh, here's a Bob Gibson parallel.
[46:49.550 --> 46:50.010]  Look at that.
[46:50.110 --> 46:50.790]  That's a good-looking card.
[46:51.110 --> 46:51.850]  That's a gorgeous card.
[46:52.530 --> 46:53.190]  Sleeve that.
[46:53.330 --> 46:53.730]  So what do we get?
[46:53.970 --> 46:55.810]  Our number 26 to 199.
[46:57.630 --> 46:57.990]  Rookie.
[46:58.290 --> 46:58.630]  I don't know.
[46:58.770 --> 46:59.890]  I don't know how to.
[47:00.810 --> 47:01.570]  I don't know how.
[47:01.670 --> 47:02.770]  I don't know top parallels.
[47:02.930 --> 47:03.690]  But here's a blue.
[47:04.030 --> 47:04.190]  Zach Popp.
[47:04.190 --> 47:05.070]  Some kind of refractor.
[47:05.370 --> 47:06.150]  Zach Popp rookie.
[47:06.470 --> 47:07.190]  I don't know who he is.
[47:07.370 --> 47:08.150]  Do you know Zach Popp?
[47:08.530 --> 47:08.830]  No.
[47:08.990 --> 47:10.430]  I would assume an outfielder or a pitcher.
[47:10.950 --> 47:11.430]  That's good.
[47:11.570 --> 47:12.190]  That's really good.
[47:12.350 --> 47:12.850]  That's really good.
[47:13.230 --> 47:15.590]  We'll open one more and then we'll save the rest.
[47:15.590 --> 47:15.830]  Cool.
[47:16.630 --> 47:17.350]  All right.
[47:19.310 --> 47:21.810]  Here we have Lou Boudreau.
[47:22.430 --> 47:22.590]  Okay.
[47:24.290 --> 47:24.650]  Yes.
[47:24.650 --> 47:25.550]  This is Karl Yastrzemski.
[47:27.470 --> 47:29.810]  The man whose brain is detached from his body.
[47:29.850 --> 47:30.410]  Ted Williams.
[47:30.410 --> 47:30.690]  Ted Williams.
[47:31.150 --> 47:31.510]  Yes.
[47:31.670 --> 47:32.430]  He took his brain out?
[47:32.570 --> 47:32.790]  It's frozen.
[47:32.790 --> 47:33.450]  His family took it.
[47:33.490 --> 47:34.150]  They froze his brain.
[47:34.310 --> 47:34.490]  Why?
[47:34.810 --> 47:36.350]  Because he wants to be resurrected someday.
[47:36.510 --> 47:36.650]  Oh.
[47:37.030 --> 47:38.310]  And have his brain put into a new body.
[47:38.530 --> 47:38.610]  Yep.
[47:39.630 --> 47:42.390]  We have a Ted Williams Parkway in San Diego.
[47:42.630 --> 47:43.590]  Is that where the brain is?
[47:43.670 --> 47:44.330]  That's where the brain is.
[47:44.370 --> 47:45.190]  Famous baseball player.
[47:45.470 --> 47:47.490]  And then here's another body part.
[47:47.610 --> 47:48.150]  Dick Allen.
[47:48.670 --> 47:49.130]  Oh, yeah.
[47:49.190 --> 47:49.770]  That's a good one.
[47:49.850 --> 47:50.270]  There you go.
[47:52.050 --> 47:53.370]  Put him right there with gas.
[47:53.370 --> 47:53.650]  Yeah.
[47:53.770 --> 47:54.890]  Put him right there with the others.
[47:56.010 --> 47:57.310]  What else do you want to get into, Geoff?
[47:57.350 --> 47:59.410]  We still got like a little ten minutes.
[47:59.650 --> 48:00.190]  What is this?
[48:00.370 --> 48:00.670]  I don't know.
[48:00.870 --> 48:01.170]  I bought this.
[48:01.230 --> 48:01.790]  I don't know what it is.
[48:01.950 --> 48:03.190]  But it's a hobby, whatever it is.
[48:03.670 --> 48:04.370]  Is it Monopoly?
[48:04.670 --> 48:04.890]  No.
[48:04.890 --> 48:05.410]  It looks like basketball.
[48:05.570 --> 48:07.490]  I think it's Bowman University.
[48:08.130 --> 48:11.430]  So the reason I would have bought this would be to try to get a Victor Wim Binyama autograph.
[48:11.430 --> 48:12.370]  Oh, a little Wimby.
[48:12.570 --> 48:13.450]  A little Wimby card.
[48:13.510 --> 48:14.470]  Because they're going for...
[48:14.470 --> 48:15.250]  A lot right now?
[48:15.390 --> 48:15.750]  Money!
[48:16.010 --> 48:16.210]  Yeah.
[48:16.510 --> 48:19.770]  So this is two autograph cards per master box.
[48:19.770 --> 48:20.010]  Okay.
[48:20.470 --> 48:21.050]  Bowman U.
[48:21.090 --> 48:22.910]  I've never opened these before.
[48:22.910 --> 48:23.730]  I've never bought...
[48:23.730 --> 48:26.450]  If we get a Wimby and we sell it, that could pay for the whole season of the show.
[48:26.630 --> 48:26.810]  That's true.
[48:26.970 --> 48:27.470]  That's true.
[48:27.730 --> 48:28.030]  That's true.
[48:28.970 --> 48:30.150]  Are there any other...
[48:30.150 --> 48:33.970]  I know that he did a little bit of preseason, but not when you guys were there.
[48:34.050 --> 48:36.530]  But like any other talks about him?
[48:36.710 --> 48:36.990]  No.
[48:37.190 --> 48:39.570]  Like he's still fine and he's going to play and everything?
[48:39.570 --> 48:39.750]  Yeah.
[48:39.890 --> 48:41.970]  Let's open one and save the other one.
[48:42.010 --> 48:43.190]  Me and Andrew Rosas are going to go.
[48:43.690 --> 48:46.490]  Or me and Rosas are going to go down to San Antonio and watch a Wimby.
[48:46.870 --> 48:47.730]  Are you a Big Spurs fan?
[48:47.730 --> 48:48.310]  I'll probably see a few.
[48:48.430 --> 48:48.910]  He is.
[48:49.030 --> 48:49.230]  Yeah.
[48:49.710 --> 48:51.290]  I'm not, but I'll see a few Wimby games.
[48:51.390 --> 48:52.690]  See a Celtics Wimby game?
[48:52.690 --> 48:54.190]  Yeah, I will for sure.
[48:54.470 --> 48:54.750]  Okay.
[48:55.030 --> 48:56.610]  They're playing in Austin again, yeah?
[48:56.730 --> 48:56.890]  Yeah.
[48:56.890 --> 48:57.770]  They're going to do like six?
[48:58.010 --> 48:59.010]  Six or eight games, I think I said.
[48:59.010 --> 48:59.410]  Oh, great.
[48:59.530 --> 49:00.070]  Yeah, we should go again.
[49:00.290 --> 49:01.690]  I want to see the Creature.
[49:02.150 --> 49:02.990]  The Creature is the best.
[49:03.030 --> 49:04.910]  I want to see the Halftime Show with the little dog.
[49:04.970 --> 49:05.650]  Oh, the dog.
[49:05.830 --> 49:06.410]  I'm so happy.
[49:06.570 --> 49:08.410]  In my life, I never thought I'd be able to see it.
[49:08.510 --> 49:09.070]  I'm so happy.
[49:09.070 --> 49:10.150]  I want to see Scooby.
[49:10.270 --> 49:12.310]  I want to see the people that change outfits quickly.
[49:12.710 --> 49:12.850]  Yeah.
[49:13.090 --> 49:13.850]  Did you just cut yourself?
[49:13.970 --> 49:14.170]  Yeah.
[49:14.330 --> 49:14.770]  Come on.
[49:14.770 --> 49:15.510]  Yeah, I stabbed my thumb.
[49:15.570 --> 49:15.970]  We're stabbed.
[49:16.610 --> 49:17.190]  That's what I did.
[49:18.310 --> 49:21.010]  Mark Mitchell, Jairus Walker.
[49:21.010 --> 49:23.270]  These are going to be college players that have just gone into the pros.
[49:23.370 --> 49:28.290]  Chris Livingston, Anthony Black, Refractor, Neon, Neophytes.
[49:28.610 --> 49:29.530]  That's cool, I guess.
[49:29.730 --> 49:30.350]  Just leave that.
[49:30.570 --> 49:30.990]  Can I...
[49:30.990 --> 49:31.850]  And then Zack Eddy.
[49:32.170 --> 49:32.830]  What do you want to do?
[49:33.030 --> 49:33.370]  What do you want to see?
[49:34.690 --> 49:35.410]  Wendy is...
[49:35.410 --> 49:36.350]  He's got one of these cards?
[49:36.950 --> 49:37.450]  He's in this?
[49:37.530 --> 49:38.110]  He's a Refractor.
[49:38.250 --> 49:38.470]  Yeah.
[49:38.710 --> 49:39.550]  Wendy should be in here, I believe.
[49:39.610 --> 49:40.830]  What college was he in?
[49:41.170 --> 49:42.410]  He didn't go to a college.
[49:42.530 --> 49:43.470]  Maybe he's not in this?
[49:43.530 --> 49:44.110]  No, he didn't.
[49:44.690 --> 49:45.990]  So that's why I'm asking.
[49:45.990 --> 49:47.130]  Maybe he isn't in this.
[49:47.390 --> 49:48.010]  I don't remember.
[49:48.830 --> 49:49.750]  I bought it for a reason.
[49:49.830 --> 49:50.490]  A specific reason.
[49:50.490 --> 49:52.210]  I don't remember what that reason was, but it...
[49:52.210 --> 49:54.470]  The college he went to was the French League?
[49:55.390 --> 49:55.650]  Where he dominated?
[49:55.650 --> 49:58.990]  Ashlyn Watkins, Amari Bailey, Vincent Owuchowuku.
[49:59.630 --> 49:59.870]  Cool.
[50:00.190 --> 50:00.930]  Oh, here we go.
[50:01.670 --> 50:02.390]  Rasier Bolton.
[50:02.470 --> 50:02.670]  Oh!
[50:03.370 --> 50:04.530]  There we go, that's cool.
[50:04.930 --> 50:06.710]  And then Jordan Hawkins, Refractor.
[50:07.330 --> 50:07.930]  That's a good question.
[50:07.990 --> 50:08.670]  Is Wendy in here?
[50:08.710 --> 50:09.170]  I don't remember.
[50:09.330 --> 50:11.530]  I mean, I would think, no, if these are college players.
[50:12.050 --> 50:13.090]  This guy went to Gonzaga.
[50:13.250 --> 50:13.890]  They're the Bulldogs.
[50:14.070 --> 50:14.450]  They are.
[50:14.470 --> 50:15.330]  That wouldn't make sense.
[50:15.470 --> 50:15.650]  No.
[50:15.710 --> 50:17.010]  It certainly wouldn't.
[50:17.090 --> 50:17.850]  Why would I have bought him?
[50:18.390 --> 50:19.750]  I definitely bought him for a reason.
[50:19.750 --> 50:21.690]  Maybe the other guys that got drafted?
[50:22.170 --> 50:23.690]  Oh, maybe I was trying to get like a Scoot Henderson.
[50:24.050 --> 50:24.630]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[50:24.630 --> 50:24.830]  That's probably what it was.
[50:25.750 --> 50:28.810]  Felix, Okpaka, and the thing I like about this is it has male and female players in it.
[50:28.910 --> 50:29.870]  Oh, that's very cool.
[50:30.010 --> 50:31.010]  I have...
[50:33.430 --> 50:35.450]  I'm pretty close to picking my WNBA team.
[50:35.530 --> 50:35.790]  Are you?
[50:35.810 --> 50:37.070]  It's between Vegas and New York.
[50:37.150 --> 50:37.510]  You getting there?
[50:37.590 --> 50:38.290]  Between the Aces and the Liberties.
[50:38.330 --> 50:38.570]  That's cool.
[50:38.650 --> 50:39.450]  I haven't decided yet.
[50:39.610 --> 50:39.870]  That's cool.
[50:40.630 --> 50:41.770]  Lady Liberty, that's cute.
[50:42.090 --> 50:43.490]  Oh, look at this.
[50:44.170 --> 50:44.490]  Diecut.
[50:45.170 --> 50:45.490]  Sasser.
[50:46.270 --> 50:46.770]  He's Sasser.
[50:46.770 --> 50:47.590]  Oh, that's a cool one.
[50:47.610 --> 50:48.730]  Is he just a one name?
[50:48.730 --> 50:49.710]  Marcus Sasser.
[50:50.250 --> 50:51.110]  Yeah, he's like a Cher.
[50:51.390 --> 50:52.470]  Dang, that's neat.
[50:53.370 --> 50:54.290]  I like Cher and Sasser.
[50:54.630 --> 50:55.130]  I'm a Donut.
[50:55.190 --> 50:55.910]  Can you sleeve that?
[50:56.050 --> 50:56.250]  Yeah.
[50:57.790 --> 50:59.890]  Hardwood, Warriors, Adam Flagler.
[51:00.890 --> 51:01.290]  Okay.
[51:01.530 --> 51:01.830]  All right.
[51:02.130 --> 51:03.210]  Sleeve that because it's parallel.
[51:03.670 --> 51:05.110]  And then Trey White.
[51:05.470 --> 51:06.070]  Sleeve that.
[51:06.390 --> 51:07.550]  Three more packs here.
[51:07.630 --> 51:09.150]  Getting a couple little hits here, huh?
[51:09.830 --> 51:11.530]  It must have been the Scoot Henderson I was going for.
[51:11.530 --> 51:12.170]  Are all these people...
[51:12.170 --> 51:12.930]  Or the twins.
[51:13.110 --> 51:13.670]  ...got drafted?
[51:13.990 --> 51:14.530]  Yeah, these people.
[51:14.670 --> 51:15.570]  I would assume so.
[51:15.710 --> 51:16.830]  Most of them.
[51:19.010 --> 51:19.730]  Hunter Dickinson.
[51:21.210 --> 51:22.130]  Oh, here we go.
[51:22.370 --> 51:24.530]  It's become a face favorite.
[51:24.950 --> 51:25.670]  Grady Dick.
[51:25.670 --> 51:26.410]  Yeah, Grady!
[51:28.670 --> 51:29.610]  We'll go ahead and sleeve that.
[51:29.670 --> 51:30.830]  And also, his name is a thing.
[51:30.970 --> 51:32.810]  Yeah, but is this something we're going to hang on to?
[51:32.910 --> 51:33.510]  Or is his name a thing?
[51:34.030 --> 51:34.450]  Name a thing.
[51:34.630 --> 51:34.830]  Okay.
[51:35.750 --> 51:38.110]  It's just a base.
[51:38.250 --> 51:38.650]  Pun name?
[51:40.650 --> 51:41.370]  Bryce Sensabaugh.
[51:41.750 --> 51:42.130]  That's cool.
[51:42.230 --> 51:42.930]  That's a refractor.
[51:43.310 --> 51:46.210]  And then Bowman Masterpiece is parallel.
[51:46.890 --> 51:47.690]  That's a good looking card.
[51:47.990 --> 51:48.650]  Cam Whitmore.
[51:48.810 --> 51:49.050]  Okay.
[51:49.110 --> 51:49.870]  That's a nice card, actually.
[51:50.330 --> 51:50.970]  Cam Whitmore's a good player.
[51:51.670 --> 51:54.650]  Okay, let's move on to the last two packs of this.
[51:55.010 --> 51:56.590]  And then we're going to open up one more thing real fast.
[51:56.670 --> 51:57.950]  And then we're going to open up the thing.
[51:58.730 --> 52:02.530]  Don't forget, we're going to be opening this thing at the end of the show.
[52:03.050 --> 52:04.530]  There's two cards inside of it.
[52:04.730 --> 52:05.750]  They could be worth nothing.
[52:05.870 --> 52:07.010]  They could pay for the whole...
[52:07.010 --> 52:08.590]  They could pay for a whole year of this show.
[52:09.170 --> 52:09.810]  Oh, God.
[52:10.150 --> 52:11.510]  You said yes, open it.
[52:11.510 --> 52:13.110]  Because you watched live on the Rooster Teeth.
[52:13.110 --> 52:13.990]  Rossier Bolton.
[52:14.230 --> 52:15.610]  Demar Langford.
[52:15.770 --> 52:16.110]  Langford!
[52:16.270 --> 52:19.310]  I wonder if he's related to Romeo Langford at all, who played for the Celtics briefly.
[52:21.010 --> 52:22.050]  Chance Westry.
[52:22.950 --> 52:23.990]  Malik Renaud.
[52:24.370 --> 52:25.510]  Flashing Lights will sleeve that.
[52:25.650 --> 52:27.470]  And then Tyrese Hunter from UT.
[52:27.990 --> 52:28.750]  That's a refractor.
[52:28.750 --> 52:29.090]  Hook them!
[52:29.710 --> 52:30.770]  Hook them.
[52:31.030 --> 52:31.530]  Hook them.
[52:31.530 --> 52:31.990]  Hook them.
[52:33.350 --> 52:33.650]  Thank you.
[52:33.750 --> 52:34.350]  Gracie, did you go to UT?
[52:34.870 --> 52:35.150]  I did.
[52:35.390 --> 52:35.910]  Gross.
[52:38.310 --> 52:39.350]  Jeremy Roach.
[52:39.750 --> 52:40.910]  Brandon Murray.
[52:40.910 --> 52:43.610]  Here's another Bowman masterpiece.
[52:44.170 --> 52:45.050]  This is Amari Bailey.
[52:45.230 --> 52:45.910]  Another great player.
[52:46.090 --> 52:46.670]  College player.
[52:47.750 --> 52:48.390]  Kyle Flapowski.
[52:49.050 --> 52:49.690]  Hardwood Warriors.
[52:49.950 --> 52:52.910]  And then an Avery Anderson refractor.
[52:53.490 --> 52:53.690]  Okay.
[52:53.950 --> 52:54.990]  How do you feel about the pack?
[52:55.670 --> 52:55.970]  Interesting.
[52:56.190 --> 52:56.350]  Yeah?
[52:56.610 --> 52:56.910]  Interesting.
[52:57.090 --> 52:57.770]  I still have the other one.
[52:58.090 --> 52:59.230]  Like, I only opened half the box.
[52:59.650 --> 53:00.510]  The other banger...
[53:00.510 --> 53:01.450]  There could be a real hit in there.
[53:01.470 --> 53:03.250]  So we got a few more than five minutes.
[53:03.450 --> 53:03.630]  All right.
[53:03.650 --> 53:04.250]  We have a few more five minutes.
[53:04.330 --> 53:05.310]  I want to briefly open...
[53:05.310 --> 53:06.570]  You want to get into something that you want to get into?
[53:06.570 --> 53:07.670]  Some basketball that I want to open.
[53:07.670 --> 53:08.010]  Let's do it.
[53:08.050 --> 53:08.390]  I'm excited.
[53:08.390 --> 53:08.870]  I like it.
[53:09.170 --> 53:09.890]  New select.
[53:10.070 --> 53:13.330]  I like this part of the show where we got through some of, like, the wacky stuff and
[53:13.330 --> 53:14.530]  you're like, this is the thing I've been waiting for.
[53:14.730 --> 53:14.850]  Yeah.
[53:14.970 --> 53:15.350]  That's fun.
[53:15.630 --> 53:16.770]  I'm going to open these three packs.
[53:16.870 --> 53:17.010]  Okay.
[53:17.030 --> 53:17.650]  Save the rest.
[53:19.290 --> 53:19.930]  And then...
[53:19.930 --> 53:21.450]  And then we're going to open the big one.
[53:21.610 --> 53:22.610]  And then we'll open...
[53:22.610 --> 53:22.770]  Yeah.
[53:22.830 --> 53:25.070]  Do you think it's the biggest Grady Dick show?
[53:25.870 --> 53:27.670]  Like, do you think anybody else is like...
[53:27.670 --> 53:29.390]  I feel like he's like the official...
[53:30.050 --> 53:30.550]  We're dickheads.
[53:30.750 --> 53:31.490]  Yeah, we're dickheads.
[53:31.670 --> 53:32.510]  I think we're...
[53:32.510 --> 53:34.270]  I was going to say we're dickstands, but I think we're dickheads.
[53:34.610 --> 53:35.110]  Dickheads is good.
[53:35.230 --> 53:35.870]  Yeah, I think we're dickheads.
[53:36.030 --> 53:36.890]  And I'm going to...
[53:36.890 --> 53:38.210]  Grady, come on the break show.
[53:38.410 --> 53:38.930]  What else are we doing?
[53:39.690 --> 53:40.170]  We're...
[53:40.170 --> 53:41.350]  He has the best cards.
[53:41.530 --> 53:42.890]  We are the biggest...
[53:43.810 --> 53:44.290]  Dickheads.
[53:44.790 --> 53:45.610]  Dickhead podcast.
[53:46.050 --> 53:46.510]  Yeah, 100%.
[53:46.510 --> 53:47.310]  Absolutely.
[53:47.530 --> 53:48.010]  Absolutely.
[53:48.010 --> 53:48.590]  Listen to this.
[53:48.890 --> 53:50.290]  With the blue shirt.
[53:50.510 --> 53:50.710]  Nice.
[53:51.450 --> 53:52.070]  Matches the...
[53:52.070 --> 53:53.130]  It's a weird color match.
[53:53.250 --> 53:53.370]  Yeah.
[53:54.490 --> 53:55.250]  Trey Young.
[53:57.110 --> 53:57.970]  Jimmy Butler.
[53:58.810 --> 54:00.050]  That is a prism.
[54:00.290 --> 54:00.730]  Can you...
[54:00.730 --> 54:01.530]  That's a silver.
[54:02.070 --> 54:03.370]  I like Jimmy Butler.
[54:03.490 --> 54:04.090]  I just hate the...
[54:04.090 --> 54:04.930]  Oh, 100%.
[54:04.930 --> 54:06.590]  Evan Mobley, Cracked Ice.
[54:07.730 --> 54:10.170]  I guess it's just a Cracked Ice parallel, because it's already a blue card.
[54:10.510 --> 54:11.550]  So it's probably not a blue parallel.
[54:11.750 --> 54:13.550]  Like, if I had a team in the East, I'd hate Jimmy Butler.
[54:14.110 --> 54:14.350]  You know?
[54:14.690 --> 54:15.210]  He's just...
[54:15.210 --> 54:15.810]  I do have a team in the East.
[54:15.930 --> 54:16.910]  I do hate Jimmy Butler.
[54:17.050 --> 54:18.490]  What's your basketball team?
[54:18.990 --> 54:19.490]  I don't know.
[54:19.510 --> 54:20.210]  The Lakers, I guess.
[54:20.650 --> 54:21.430]  I really don't have one.
[54:21.470 --> 54:21.830]  Lake Show.
[54:23.390 --> 54:23.950]  Pascal Siakam.
[54:23.970 --> 54:25.330]  I only like Austin Reeves.
[54:25.570 --> 54:26.230]  Paul George.
[54:26.310 --> 54:26.910]  Oh, this is cool.
[54:27.210 --> 54:29.990]  Paul George and then his teammate, his partner in crime, Kawhi Leonard.
[54:30.230 --> 54:30.510]  Nice.
[54:30.510 --> 54:31.850]  This is what they call a tri-color parallel.
[54:32.790 --> 54:33.630]  This is a green...
[54:33.630 --> 54:34.210]  Can't wait, man.
[54:34.210 --> 54:36.410]  Kawhi's going to put up some numbers this year.
[54:36.630 --> 54:37.830]  What team does Grady Dick play for?
[54:38.150 --> 54:39.390]  John Morant, again.
[54:40.070 --> 54:40.870]  Did he play for the...
[54:40.870 --> 54:42.830]  Did he get drafted by the 76?
[54:43.510 --> 54:43.990]  I can't remember.
[54:45.090 --> 54:45.490]  76ers?
[54:45.490 --> 54:46.130]  Maybe not.
[54:46.850 --> 54:48.410]  Alexa, who does Grady Dick play for?
[54:51.210 --> 54:52.610]  Chat, who does Grady Dick play for?
[54:52.610 --> 54:54.370]  He was drafted 13th, I think, or 14th.
[54:54.730 --> 54:55.450]  Keegan Murray.
[54:55.950 --> 54:57.030]  Paul George again.
[54:57.290 --> 54:58.910]  RJ Barrett, silver parallel.
[54:59.150 --> 55:00.410]  Remember, his nickname is RJ Barrett.
[55:00.530 --> 55:02.090]  A lot of PG-13 cards, bud.
[55:02.210 --> 55:02.730]  Covered that earlier.
[55:02.730 --> 55:04.410]  And then Daylon Terry.
[55:04.630 --> 55:05.930]  You said PG-13 cards?
[55:06.210 --> 55:06.250]  Yeah.
[55:06.470 --> 55:08.530]  That is maybe the lamest thing in the NBA.
[55:08.890 --> 55:09.130]  What?
[55:09.550 --> 55:11.470]  Paul George's nickname is PG-13.
[55:11.670 --> 55:11.830]  Yeah.
[55:12.210 --> 55:15.290]  Because Chris Paul is CP-3, because there were three, so Paul George is 13.
[55:15.410 --> 55:16.150]  PG-13.
[55:16.590 --> 55:17.750]  It's so, like...
[55:17.750 --> 55:20.110]  It's such a clever thing if you're...
[55:20.110 --> 55:20.910]  13.
[55:21.810 --> 55:22.850]  But you're not.
[55:23.690 --> 55:25.070]  If you're PG-13.
[55:25.150 --> 55:26.150]  Yeah, you're PG-13.
[55:26.390 --> 55:26.910]  Okay, Geoff.
[55:27.250 --> 55:28.210]  About five minutes left.
[55:28.350 --> 55:28.650]  Oh, God.
[55:28.650 --> 55:30.830]  Do you want to open some other packs of something to get...
[55:30.830 --> 55:31.370]  Oh, here we go.
[55:31.370 --> 55:32.570]  We'll go back to these popsicles.
[55:32.570 --> 55:32.850]  I like it.
[55:32.970 --> 55:33.890]  Just open it in front of me.
[55:34.850 --> 55:35.230]  Let's do it.
[55:35.310 --> 55:35.990]  Switching back to baseball.
[55:36.110 --> 55:37.290]  John Gray.
[55:37.490 --> 55:37.750]  Cool.
[55:38.550 --> 55:39.710]  Stephen Kwan, rookie.
[55:39.890 --> 55:40.110]  Okay.
[55:40.290 --> 55:40.750]  We'll unsleeve that.
[55:40.770 --> 55:42.050]  Yeah, I was going to say, that's one you want to probably hang on to.
[55:42.050 --> 55:42.990]  Bob Lennon's a food.
[55:43.170 --> 55:43.770]  Oh, food.
[55:43.810 --> 55:44.410]  Unsleeve that.
[55:44.450 --> 55:44.650]  That's a good one, yeah.
[55:44.670 --> 55:45.830]  And then Joe Adele.
[55:47.330 --> 55:47.650]  Refractor?
[55:47.770 --> 55:48.090]  No.
[55:48.310 --> 55:49.410]  Just a Joe Adele base card.
[55:49.950 --> 55:50.990]  Might as well finish these out.
[55:50.990 --> 55:51.650]  Might as well, right?
[55:51.810 --> 55:51.950]  Yeah.
[55:51.990 --> 55:52.870]  Let's do it.
[55:53.490 --> 55:54.530]  I like the chrome baseball.
[55:54.530 --> 55:58.050]  I don't know if I like these cards, but I like when we get into recent baseball cards.
[55:58.050 --> 56:02.570]  The hottest cards in baseball right now, the hottest cards in the market right now are
[56:03.270 --> 56:06.330]  Tops 20, 22, 23, whatever the new season is.
[56:06.850 --> 56:07.590]  Chrome baseball.
[56:07.810 --> 56:09.690]  And I have a hobby box that I bought.
[56:10.170 --> 56:11.790]  And they are fucking fire.
[56:12.070 --> 56:13.170]  And everybody's getting great pulls.
[56:13.270 --> 56:14.790]  But I think I might have left it at home.
[56:15.010 --> 56:15.290]  That's fine.
[56:15.390 --> 56:17.050]  We'll get into it next time.
[56:17.450 --> 56:18.550]  Because we'll be here next time.
[56:19.190 --> 56:19.490]  Raptors.
[56:19.590 --> 56:20.030]  Okay, thank you.
[56:20.150 --> 56:20.550]  Canada.
[56:21.550 --> 56:21.950]  Toronto.
[56:23.370 --> 56:24.170]  Alberto Mondesi.
[56:24.470 --> 56:25.090]  That's a nice...
[56:25.090 --> 56:25.930]  You know what?
[56:26.150 --> 56:26.650]  That's sweet.
[56:26.650 --> 56:29.930]  I don't know anything about Alberto Mondesi, but I like him.
[56:29.990 --> 56:30.350]  Yeah, nice guy.
[56:30.470 --> 56:32.470]  That's a likable dude.
[56:32.570 --> 56:33.450]  Do we have a likable guy?
[56:33.550 --> 56:34.170]  Like good guys?
[56:34.790 --> 56:35.650]  I just have good guys.
[56:35.770 --> 56:36.590]  I think good guys are good.
[56:36.970 --> 56:39.650]  I mean, we have the dad who stepped up, but I think that's different.
[56:40.510 --> 56:41.230]  Ernie Banks.
[56:43.590 --> 56:44.710]  Hall of Famer, obviously.
[56:44.790 --> 56:45.110]  Absolutely.
[56:46.450 --> 56:47.170]  Pavin Smith.
[56:50.250 --> 56:51.010]  Diamondback, obviously.
[56:51.210 --> 56:54.130]  Nick Allen rookie with a imperfection on the card.
[56:54.230 --> 56:54.490]  Nice.
[56:54.490 --> 56:57.850]  This is a parallel, so that's a refractor.
[56:58.050 --> 56:58.270]  Okay.
[56:59.150 --> 57:00.750]  Last pack of these before we get into it.
[57:00.870 --> 57:02.110]  And then we're doing the thing.
[57:02.310 --> 57:02.990]  Call your friends.
[57:03.130 --> 57:05.650]  Tell them to tune in, because after we get to this pack, we're doing the big one.
[57:05.930 --> 57:06.910]  Michael Chavis?
[57:07.090 --> 57:07.450]  Chavis?
[57:07.790 --> 57:08.430]  You know how to say it?
[57:08.530 --> 57:09.170]  Michael Chavis.
[57:09.270 --> 57:09.530]  Chavis.
[57:10.210 --> 57:10.930]  Robbie Grossman.
[57:11.450 --> 57:11.810]  Ugh.
[57:12.690 --> 57:13.410]  Ah, yuck.
[57:13.550 --> 57:14.650]  Ah, yuck.
[57:15.750 --> 57:17.110]  Stephen Riddings rookie.
[57:17.690 --> 57:19.330]  I don't know him, but Yankee pitcher.
[57:19.710 --> 57:20.950]  And then Max Scherzer.
[57:22.130 --> 57:23.410]  That's him about a team ago, yeah.
[57:23.410 --> 57:24.270]  Dylan Met?
[57:24.410 --> 57:24.690]  Nope.
[57:24.850 --> 57:25.490]  Where is he now?
[57:25.710 --> 57:26.630]  He's at Texas Rangers.
[57:26.710 --> 57:27.610]  Texas Rangers, that's right.
[57:27.690 --> 57:31.050]  He went to the Rangers, and Verlander went back to the Astros.
[57:31.370 --> 57:34.630]  The Met said, guys, we're putting everything we have into this season.
[57:34.750 --> 57:38.310]  They got halfway through the season, and they said, never mind, we're competing in 2026.
[57:38.770 --> 57:39.730]  Do you guys want to leave?
[57:40.170 --> 57:42.810]  And Scherzer said, yeah, fuck yes.
[57:42.910 --> 57:45.410]  And then Verlander said, yeah, send me back home, let's go.
[57:46.090 --> 57:52.510]  Fucking, by the way, just to keep the audience up to date, Gus decided today that he figured
[57:52.510 --> 57:56.010]  out how to give this Tiger's Go away on the Anma episode.
[57:56.270 --> 57:56.870]  So, listen to Anma.
[57:57.190 --> 58:02.850]  Yeah, if you listen to next week's Anma, you'll answer how to get that pack of cards.
[58:02.850 --> 58:04.730]  But, now is the time.
[58:05.610 --> 58:06.410]  Oh, gosh.
[58:06.730 --> 58:08.390]  Okay, Geoff, explain what this is one more time.
[58:08.570 --> 58:09.090]  One more time.
[58:09.270 --> 58:10.750]  This is called a rip card.
[58:11.350 --> 58:15.450]  They come in normal size, and they'll have like one tiny card inside, so they come in
[58:15.450 --> 58:21.590]  a size like this, but they come as a box topper in certain hobby boxes of Allen and Ginter,
[58:21.590 --> 58:24.090]  and it's like an oversized card.
[58:24.250 --> 58:25.550]  It's numbered 31 to 75.
[58:26.770 --> 58:30.330]  Last time I looked it up, I did a comp on it, it was about 350 bucks.
[58:30.570 --> 58:34.950]  Just this card, as it is right now, for Cal Ripken fans would pay $350 for this.
[58:35.330 --> 58:36.470]  There's only 75 in the world.
[58:37.410 --> 58:39.270]  There's only 75 on Earth, right?
[58:39.550 --> 58:42.050]  But if you flip it over, it says this is a rip card.
[58:42.110 --> 58:43.410]  You can rip it or you can keep it.
[58:43.550 --> 58:47.370]  To discover three collectible exclusive mini cards embedded inside.
[58:47.370 --> 58:55.230]  I can open this up and inside are three cards that could be worth way more than this $350 card.
[58:55.370 --> 58:55.590]  Could be.
[58:55.870 --> 58:59.550]  Probably worth way less than this $350 card.
[58:59.990 --> 59:02.610]  I've been holding onto it since 2020.
[59:02.870 --> 59:03.910]  And we left it to the chat.
[59:03.950 --> 59:04.330]  2021.
[59:04.670 --> 59:07.710]  We left it to the live chat to see what we should do.
[59:08.690 --> 59:09.210]  73%.
[59:09.210 --> 59:09.710]  Yeah.
[59:09.950 --> 59:11.530]  73% said open it.
[59:11.610 --> 59:12.730]  Geoff, now's the time.
[59:14.170 --> 59:15.850]  I've never opened a rip card before.
[59:16.970 --> 59:18.030]  Oh, my God.
[59:18.270 --> 59:19.190]  Oh, God.
[59:19.190 --> 59:19.650]  How does it feel?
[59:20.030 --> 59:20.610]  I don't like it.
[59:23.570 --> 59:25.230]  It doesn't feel good.
[59:25.290 --> 59:27.130]  It feels like I'm ruining a $350 card.
[59:27.950 --> 59:28.570]  Okay, here we go.
[59:29.870 --> 59:30.310]  Okay.
[59:32.630 --> 59:33.450]  What is it?
[59:33.530 --> 59:34.130]  Oh, gosh.
[59:34.410 --> 59:39.230]  We got a Johnny Bench.
[59:39.430 --> 59:39.870]  Okay.
[59:41.830 --> 59:43.010]  What do they call these?
[59:43.190 --> 59:43.690]  The tobacco cards?
[59:43.710 --> 59:44.330]  Stain glass.
[59:44.330 --> 59:45.110]  Stain glass cards.
[59:45.230 --> 59:46.850]  So this is the stain glass Johnny Bench card.
[59:47.290 --> 59:48.770]  I have no idea how much that's worth.
[59:48.770 --> 59:49.370]  Do you know anything about him?
[59:49.630 --> 59:50.050]  Who is he?
[59:50.290 --> 59:52.550]  Johnny Bench is a Hall of Famer, big time.
[59:53.130 --> 59:55.550]  He can hold like five baseballs in his hand.
[59:55.650 --> 59:56.010]  Really?
[59:56.350 --> 01:00:01.750]  We actually have, as a part of one of the early break shows we did, we got a Johnny Bench auto.
[01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.710]  Oh, that's right.
[01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:05.050]  Somewhere in here is a Johnny Bench auto to go with this.
[01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:05.710]  Hall of Famer.
[01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:06.450]  Sleeve that.
[01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:07.090]  Sleeve that.
[01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.610]  No hesitation.
[01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:10.070]  And I'll put it on a proper tobacco sleeve when we get home.
[01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.710]  All right, let's see.
[01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:12.610]  Two more.
[01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:14.210]  And then we're done.
[01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:15.650]  Joey Votto.
[01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:18.170]  Hey, future Hall of Famer probably.
[01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:21.390]  That's just a parallel, so it's just like a slightly rarer version of the normal one.
[01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:22.510]  It's definitely not...
[01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:23.030]  Worth anything?
[01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:23.410]  No.
[01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:25.610]  Oh my god, there's one more?
[01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:26.750]  Yep, last one.
[01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:29.910]  Jackie Robinson.
[01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:35.430]  So these are not worth what this was worth.
[01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:36.990]  For sure.
[01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:38.490]  For sure.
[01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:40.290]  We took an L on this one.
[01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:42.350]  But that's okay, because now we know.
[01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:44.530]  And I've got my first ever stained glass.
[01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:45.270]  You've got a stained glass.
[01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:46.070]  But you know what?
[01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:51.010]  We can put it up and like how it was displayed in your office.
[01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:51.590]  Yeah, you'll never...
[01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:52.610]  We just don't have to show the back.
[01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:54.270]  And then if you could sleeve these.
[01:00:54.330 --> 01:00:56.570]  I'm going to double check these when I get home to see.
[01:00:57.130 --> 01:00:58.650]  They might be worth...
[01:00:58.650 --> 01:00:59.410]  They are rare.
[01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:00.430]  They're not base cards.
[01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:00.670]  Yeah.
[01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.010]  But they are not...
[01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:03.470]  They're like maybe...
[01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:05.850]  Well, we did it.
[01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:06.910]  We did it, y'all.
[01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:08.670]  That was another episode of The Break Show.
[01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:11.330]  Geoff, Emily, thank you so much.
[01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:12.410]  Thank you so much, Eric.
[01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:13.270]  That was a lot of fun.
[01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:14.110]  It was a lot of fun.
[01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.710]  Don't forget.
[01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:15.790]  We'll be back next Monday.
[01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:16.550]  Live episode.
[01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:19.010]  You can watch every Monday on the Rooster Teeth site.
[01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:20.070]  We have the chat and everything.
[01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:23.030]  You can also watch on the Face YouTube channel.
[01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:24.710]  Easy come, easy go.
[01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:25.610]  Yeah, c'est la vie.
[01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.830]  Here's the thing.
[01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:29.490]  You can go subscribe to So Alright, Geoff's new podcast.
[01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:30.690]  There's a link in the description.
[01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:36.170]  And it'll be a new episode starting next week.
[01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:37.650]  So you can check it out there.
[01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:38.250]  Damn.
[01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:42.630]  Maybe he'll do an episode on rip cards and what you might get from them.
[01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:43.030]  Yeah.
[01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:45.670]  The entire time I've collected, I've only gotten one rip card.
[01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:47.050]  Well, let's get some more.
[01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:49.090]  Buy some more, Alan.
[01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:50.010]  That's fine.
[01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.410]  You know what?
[01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:50.990]  You're worth it.
[01:01:51.070 --> 01:01:51.770]  Oh, I hadn't considered that.
[01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:52.170]  That was fine.
[01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:52.870]  I am worth it.
[01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:53.070]  That's great.
[01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.430]  Yeah.
[01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:53.750]  All right.
[01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:54.930]  Well, thanks for tuning in.
[01:01:54.970 --> 01:02:01.470]  And we'll see you next Monday when we open up boxes and boxes of boxes of crap.
[01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:03.690]  What an ending.
