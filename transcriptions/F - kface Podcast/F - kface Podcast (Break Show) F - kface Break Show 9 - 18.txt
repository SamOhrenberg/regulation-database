[00:06.060 --> 00:11.120]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Mostly Weekly Break Show.
[00:11.240 --> 00:15.840]  As always, my name is Geoff Ramsey, and I'm here with you as Mostly.
[00:16.320 --> 00:20.960]  Emily is here, and as usually, Eric is here, but he is not here today.
[00:21.200 --> 00:23.860]  Unfortunately, he is stuck in another production that ran over,
[00:24.320 --> 00:29.900]  so it's just gonna be my sweet Emily and I entertaining you
[00:29.900 --> 00:33.860]  by opening up all kinds of nonsense, from Army of Darkness cards today
[00:33.860 --> 00:39.100]  to Beavis and Butthead to basketball stuff. We got it all. We got tons of stuff.
[00:39.180 --> 00:42.240]  I got a bunch of new stuff to entertain you with today.
[00:42.340 --> 00:44.940]  And at the very end of the break show, I'm super excited.
[00:45.300 --> 00:48.100]  I'm going to unbox... I haven't actually unboxed it myself yet.
[00:48.100 --> 00:50.200]  I haven't seen it, so I'm gonna be seeing it for the first time with you.
[00:50.480 --> 00:55.280]  This is the Sloppy Bingo set that we're gonna be releasing next Friday night.
[00:55.380 --> 00:58.480]  I think at night. Like, we're gonna do a live...
[00:58.480 --> 01:01.320]  This is why I wish Eric was here, because he knows dates and times and shit.
[01:01.320 --> 01:06.200]  But next Friday night, we're gonna be doing a live Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[01:06.720 --> 01:11.680]  I think around, like, 9 or 10 our time. And this will be for sale during that period.
[01:11.860 --> 01:14.300]  So at the end of this episode, we will open this up together,
[01:14.480 --> 01:17.560]  and we will get to see... hopefully be amazed at how cool it is,
[01:17.600 --> 01:21.020]  and not embarrassed at how lame it is. So fingers crossed.
[01:21.560 --> 01:25.260]  But before we... Oh, and, you know, I've got the cards from last week graded.
[01:26.360 --> 01:29.460]  I can tell you how much they're worth. We've got the pack sack.
[01:29.460 --> 01:31.880]  We've got all the shit you're used to.
[01:33.260 --> 01:36.860]  But before we get into it, if you wouldn't mind indulging me,
[01:37.000 --> 01:40.500]  I'm gonna give you... I'm gonna take, like, 10 minutes of your time, maybe,
[01:41.500 --> 01:46.940]  to talk to you about something. If you're coming to the break show from Fuckface,
[01:47.040 --> 01:49.560]  and you're a regulation listener or a comment leaver,
[01:50.100 --> 01:53.820]  some of this information may be lost on you, and if that's the case, I apologize.
[01:55.500 --> 01:57.080]  I'll get through it as quickly as possible.
[01:57.080 --> 02:01.380]  But if you are aware of the Rooster Teeth community at large,
[02:01.480 --> 02:06.620]  then you might have heard the news today that the Achievement Hunter brand
[02:06.620 --> 02:11.700]  is coming to a close. We have decided to sunset it and to end it.
[02:12.280 --> 02:16.020]  And I've seen a lot of... for a very good reason.
[02:16.280 --> 02:19.600]  And that announcement came in tandem with another announcement,
[02:19.740 --> 02:21.860]  a very exciting announcement, about a new brand called Dog Bark.
[02:21.860 --> 02:27.060]  And I've seen a lot of excitement, a lot of appreciation from people,
[02:27.260 --> 02:31.560]  a lot of people supporting Michael and those guys going off and doing their own new thing.
[02:31.700 --> 02:36.580]  I've seen a lot of fear and uncertainty. I totally get and understand that.
[02:36.660 --> 02:38.280]  You guys are hearing about this for the first time.
[02:39.640 --> 02:41.500]  I've known about it for about six months.
[02:41.780 --> 02:47.440]  This has been in some form of discussion or preparation for a while now.
[02:47.440 --> 02:49.920]  This isn't a decision that was made lightly.
[02:51.980 --> 02:56.680]  But I think it's the right decision, and I hope that you'll understand and support that.
[02:57.040 --> 03:04.420]  And here's why. Fifteen years ago, I went to Bernie and Matt and Gus,
[03:04.660 --> 03:08.960]  and I said, hey, I'm losing my mind making Red vs. Blue.
[03:09.180 --> 03:13.820]  It was season five or six. I think it was six or seven, actually.
[03:13.820 --> 03:18.640]  And I was just so creatively drained and stifled.
[03:18.960 --> 03:26.240]  And I had had such a wonderful time making Red vs. Blue, but I had made it until I couldn't make it anymore.
[03:26.500 --> 03:31.600]  And I had this idea, and I was very passionate about this idea, this thing I wanted to try.
[03:32.120 --> 03:40.800]  And Bernie and Gus and Matt were so kind and supportive to give me the creative runway to launch and test Achievement Hunter out
[03:40.800 --> 03:46.380]  at a time when everybody, friends, everybody was telling me, what are you doing quitting making Red vs. Blue?
[03:46.540 --> 03:50.740]  It's a huge hit. You're like the number two guy on it. You're a big part of this.
[03:51.080 --> 03:54.560]  Why would you leave that to do this unproven, untested thing?
[03:55.360 --> 03:58.360]  And I had to. I had to follow my dream. I had to follow my passion.
[03:58.660 --> 04:03.200]  And like I said, Bernie and Matt and Gus and everybody else, Jason, everybody involved in Rooster Teeth at the time,
[04:03.200 --> 04:12.360]  were so fucking supportive and so wonderful to me in that period that 15 years later, we've had 15 years of Achievement Hunter.
[04:12.440 --> 04:21.140]  We wouldn't be here on this set right now in front of all this Zimmer stuff, in front of fucking dumb pictures of Gavin and Garbage Pail Kids
[04:21.140 --> 04:25.760]  and Barbie and the fucking new Dallas poster, by the way. How's that?
[04:26.700 --> 04:31.840]  All this has existed because they allowed me to take a chance and supported me taking that chance.
[04:31.840 --> 04:43.320]  And I would be some kind of fucking hypocrite if I didn't provide the same level of support and genuine enthusiasm to Michael and Alfredo and Joe and Trevor
[04:43.320 --> 04:48.860]  as they embark on the same journey I went on 15 years ago.
[04:49.420 --> 04:56.040]  And this is a very... I don't want to speak for them. They didn't make this decision lightly, I guarantee you.
[04:56.040 --> 05:04.020]  And they will explain it in their own voice over the next few weeks as we say goodbye to Achievement Hunter and say hello to Dog Bark.
[05:05.160 --> 05:06.400]  We worked on that ahead of time.
[05:07.580 --> 05:18.020]  And so I would only ask that you give them the same level of support that the audience gave me when I tried out Achievement Hunter, this untested, unproven thing.
[05:18.020 --> 05:28.100]  And the same level of support y'all gave us when we decided that we were going to make Fuckface, an audio-only podcast recorded remotely,
[05:28.280 --> 05:33.500]  which is something that I never in a million years wanted to do or thought was a good idea until we did it and found out...
[05:33.500 --> 05:34.040]  It was simply too good.
[05:34.220 --> 05:35.160]  It was simply too good.
[05:35.400 --> 05:40.820]  Found out that it worked and it ended up becoming, I think, hopefully the best thing I've participated in.
[05:42.080 --> 05:44.220]  And I really just want to drive that point home.
[05:44.220 --> 05:55.340]  Joe and Trevor and Michael and Alfredo have spent years and years and years making content that they believe in to support and entertain you.
[05:56.940 --> 05:59.640]  And that's all they want to do with this new production.
[06:00.400 --> 06:04.200]  Everything comes to an end. It's okay for things to end.
[06:04.340 --> 06:11.320]  I know it's scary and it's sad, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen and it doesn't mean it's going away.
[06:11.320 --> 06:17.360]  We have 15 years of Achievement Hunter content online that you can still watch and enjoy.
[06:17.920 --> 06:27.860]  Hundreds of thousands of hours of content. Hundreds upon hundreds of episodes of Minecraft and GTA that are still there for you to go and watch.
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.040]  I mean, hell, I think Emily and I are a great example of that.
[06:31.340 --> 06:37.040]  We've been watching a show that came out in 1978 called Dallas. It ran from 1978 to 1992.
[06:37.040 --> 06:43.600]  And that was 40 fucking years ago. And yet here we are enjoying it just as if it came out yesterday.
[06:43.960 --> 06:44.520]  Justice for Sue Ellen.
[06:44.660 --> 06:47.500]  Justice for Sue Ellen. I think we can all agree. Justice for Sue Ellen.
[06:48.260 --> 06:56.620]  So I would just say that I hope that you'll be excited about this new journey in their careers and this new opportunity for Rooster Teeth.
[06:56.940 --> 07:01.500]  It's sad to say goodbye to a thing, but it's not disappearing. It's still there.
[07:01.640 --> 07:05.040]  You can still go watch all those videos. You can still go enjoy all that content.
[07:05.040 --> 07:08.220]  But you can also support them and what they're doing.
[07:08.580 --> 07:18.540]  And one other little inaccuracy, or not even inaccuracy, but one thing I want to touch on, and then I'll get to breaking cards and being an idiot, is a thing that kind of bugs me.
[07:19.300 --> 07:29.320]  I'm sure you've heard this phrase or some variation of this phrase before where it's said that a lie can travel halfway across the world while the truth is still putting its pants on.
[07:30.060 --> 07:31.500]  And that's kind of...
[07:31.500 --> 07:33.500]  That's deep. I've never heard that before.
[07:33.660 --> 07:34.320]  You've never heard that before?
[07:34.320 --> 07:35.360]  No, but damn.
[07:35.380 --> 07:40.120]  Yeah, and I've seen a lot of supposition and people saying things that just aren't true.
[07:40.260 --> 07:45.920]  And I want to stop that right now before they travel halfway across the world.
[07:46.020 --> 08:01.660]  Because there is no truth to the idea that, like, anytime we make a change that's controversial or a bit scary or different or new or unexpected, there's this idea that there's some dude in a suit from Warner Brothers or Rooster Teeth standing just off camera sternly going,
[08:01.660 --> 08:05.840]  make this decision, follow this algorithm, we're chasing a demographic.
[08:06.220 --> 08:07.200]  None of that is true.
[08:08.680 --> 08:17.440]  Rooster Teeth would be very happy if they continued making Achievement Hunter forever, but they weren't happy making Achievement Hunter and they wanted to try a new thing.
[08:17.820 --> 08:20.540]  They wanted to do what I did 15 years ago.
[08:20.660 --> 08:23.820]  They wanted to do what Ray did when he left Achievement Hunter, right?
[08:23.960 --> 08:27.480]  They wanted to bet on themselves and make their production.
[08:27.480 --> 08:34.960]  I love the work they put into mine and I did my best to make it ours, but at the end of the day, I left Achievement Hunter five years ago.
[08:35.440 --> 08:41.340]  It would be really foolhardy and stupid and dickheadish of me to have a problem with them doing the same thing.
[08:42.080 --> 08:43.280]  But it's also them.
[08:43.420 --> 08:45.880]  This is a decision that they made that they wanted to make.
[08:46.120 --> 08:49.120]  It didn't come from anybody at Rooster Teeth or Warner Brothers.
[08:49.120 --> 08:55.880]  There was no... I don't know, this marketing department you always hear about that's telling them to make these decisions.
[08:56.100 --> 08:59.480]  Chase the Gen Z crowd, this is the name we've workshopped.
[08:59.660 --> 09:00.480]  None of that's true.
[09:00.840 --> 09:07.980]  They came up with the name, they came up with the logo, they came up with the design, the color palette, the trailer, the content that's going to be released in a couple of weeks.
[09:08.200 --> 09:09.300]  That's all them.
[09:09.500 --> 09:10.760]  That's what they want to do.
[09:10.860 --> 09:16.300]  That is them following the same passion that I followed 15 years ago.
[09:16.540 --> 09:19.000]  And the same passion that I followed when I created Let's Play.
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.940]  And the same passion that I followed when I created Fuckface.
[09:23.040 --> 09:26.200]  And hopefully the same passion that I created this with.
[09:26.320 --> 09:29.980]  And hopefully the same passion that I'll create the next and the next and the next thing with.
[09:30.260 --> 09:34.780]  And hopefully the same passion that they get to do as they continue their career.
[09:35.060 --> 09:37.820]  So all I'm asking for is give the new thing a chance, support it.
[09:38.780 --> 09:45.420]  It's a brave thing to do to walk out of the safety of Achievement Hunter into a new thing.
[09:45.880 --> 09:51.700]  And also, I've seen a lot of doomers that are saying, like, I called it 10 years ago, I knew it was going to fail.
[09:51.900 --> 09:53.340]  It didn't fail, it ended.
[09:53.600 --> 09:56.000]  It was 15 fucking awesome years.
[09:56.480 --> 09:58.860]  And I'm going to stop talking now because I'm just going to get rambly.
[09:59.120 --> 10:02.800]  But I will say, there's a couple weeks left of Achievement Hunter content coming out.
[10:02.900 --> 10:09.700]  Where they pay homage, if you will, to a lot of the videos and the shows from the past and the people from the past.
[10:09.720 --> 10:13.240]  And they have a lot of sweet things that they're going to do.
[10:13.240 --> 10:21.440]  And it will culminate at the end with one last video that I am in, where I get fucking verbose about my feelings about all of it.
[10:21.520 --> 10:28.160]  So if you want to hear more about my feelings of the 15 years of Achievement Hunter, I ask that you tune in to that last Achievement Hunter video.
[10:28.380 --> 10:31.100]  But I also ask that you tune in to every video between now and then.
[10:31.160 --> 10:36.280]  Because they're going to be saying goodbye to Achievement Hunter with a lot of love and respect and humor.
[10:36.580 --> 10:38.260]  And I think that's what it deserves.
[10:38.360 --> 10:40.780]  And I hope that we all get to share in that together.
[10:40.780 --> 10:44.720]  And then... then... subscribe to Dog Bark.
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.600]  And give it a shot. Thank you.
[10:46.760 --> 10:52.840]  And remember that all of these people that you've loved that have come and gone are still making content right now.
[10:53.080 --> 10:54.620]  Jack and BK... I think Jack's on vacation.
[10:54.980 --> 10:59.080]  But Jack and BK are over there in Inside Gaming making content, playing video games.
[10:59.340 --> 11:01.960]  Three, four hours a day. Three or four days a week.
[11:02.060 --> 11:05.480]  Playing Minecraft. Playing all those old games that you love to see us play.
[11:06.020 --> 11:09.620]  And Michael is making Face Jam every week.
[11:09.620 --> 11:16.020]  And Michael and Trevor and Alfredo and Joe are going to be making Dog Bark every fucking day.
[11:16.340 --> 11:19.540]  And Gavin and I, we're making Fuckface every day.
[11:19.640 --> 11:21.920]  And I'm making Anima. And I'm making SoAllRight.
[11:22.220 --> 11:26.180]  And Kai is helping produce it all behind the scenes.
[11:26.560 --> 11:32.200]  Matt and Jeremy and Ray, they're streaming every fucking day of their lives, I believe.
[11:32.280 --> 11:35.000]  I think Jeremy's on like 18 days in a row right now or something.
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.680]  So all the people that you loved to support and who entertained you throughout the years, they're still doing the thing that they love.
[11:41.880 --> 11:45.260]  They're just doing it in the way that they want to do it and the way that makes sense to them.
[11:45.320 --> 11:50.220]  And I just hope that you will be respectful of that.
[11:50.520 --> 11:59.300]  And give them an opportunity to entertain you in much the same way they entertained you last year and the year before and five years ago and ten years ago.
[11:59.440 --> 12:03.180]  They just want to get up every day and make the best content they can make.
[12:03.180 --> 12:10.600]  And they're not making these decisions for any other reason than this is where their creative interests are leading them.
[12:10.740 --> 12:16.140]  And much like you gave me a chance 15 years ago, let's all give them a chance today.
[12:17.620 --> 12:20.160]  That's it. I'm done. Let's open up some fucking cards.
[12:20.960 --> 12:23.820]  Gotta figure out how to make money on this. I really want to.
[12:23.940 --> 12:25.940]  That's the mantra for me, right?
[12:26.060 --> 12:29.980]  All right, let's open up the pack sack and figure out how to make money off this fucking show.
[12:32.900 --> 12:35.820]  Topps Stadium Club. Let's see what we got.
[12:36.380 --> 12:37.480]  What year is this?
[12:37.640 --> 12:42.700]  This is from 1991, second series.
[12:43.380 --> 12:46.600]  These are famous. So Stadium Club came out and they raised the bar.
[12:47.220 --> 12:49.220]  And this is in the Junkwax era, right?
[12:50.160 --> 12:53.160]  Stadium Club came out and it raised the bar.
[12:53.260 --> 12:59.780]  They did photo quality cards, which had never been done before and really kind of blew everybody away.
[12:59.780 --> 13:03.040]  And I think the cards that we're going to look for here are probably Ken Griffey Jr. cards.
[13:03.140 --> 13:07.220]  There's Mark Davidson. Oh yeah, we're just opening the pack sack, then we'll get into last week's cards.
[13:07.380 --> 13:08.200]  Frank DiPino.
[13:08.540 --> 13:14.060]  He's a good photo. DiPino, that's almost an Italian body part. DiPino.
[13:15.580 --> 13:15.920]  Sleeve it.
[13:16.020 --> 13:16.560]  Yeah, sleeve it.
[13:17.040 --> 13:19.520]  Hey, everybody out there, sleeve your DiPino.
[13:20.120 --> 13:22.400]  You don't want any unwanted DiPinos out there.
[13:23.620 --> 13:27.660]  Greg Harris. Even to this day, these are still beautiful fucking cards.
[13:27.660 --> 13:28.960]  Scott Kamenicki.
[13:30.260 --> 13:32.420]  Ooh, here's Jonathan Habyan.
[13:33.500 --> 13:38.500]  He doesn't look as confident as you would like a picture for the New York agents to look.
[13:38.900 --> 13:43.320]  Pete Smith. He's in line for most generic name ever.
[13:43.820 --> 13:47.380]  Pete Smith. Like, could it be real? Let's have a generic Joe section.
[13:48.000 --> 13:48.860]  Eric Plunk.
[13:49.780 --> 13:51.060]  That's... name is a sound?
[13:51.520 --> 13:53.300]  Yeah, name is a... his name is a dump.
[13:53.800 --> 13:55.200]  All right, I gotta go take a plunk.
[13:56.240 --> 13:57.800]  Jack Clark. Famous Jack Clark.
[13:57.800 --> 13:58.360]  Look at him.
[13:58.360 --> 13:59.620]  He's got a... face.
[13:59.920 --> 14:04.000]  Him up close, it's hard to see, but he has a face of a plunk.
[14:04.260 --> 14:05.580]  He's got a plunky kind of face.
[14:05.820 --> 14:07.360]  Yeah, it's hard. You'll have to...
[14:07.360 --> 14:07.980]  Hard plunking.
[14:08.100 --> 14:08.480]  Look at him.
[14:08.660 --> 14:12.680]  There you go. And then also, I really like Jack Clark's...
[14:13.720 --> 14:16.060]  He goes into... section.
[14:16.940 --> 14:21.380]  Ooh, Pedro Guerrero. He's looking at his hat like he's never seen it before. He's like, what? This goes on my head?
[14:21.380 --> 14:25.880]  I wonder if he has, like, notes in it, like he's taking a test. He's like, yeah.
[14:26.060 --> 14:27.360]  He's like...
[14:28.300 --> 14:28.740]  Botulism.
[14:30.280 --> 14:32.400]  Ray Lankford. That's a cool shot.
[14:32.540 --> 14:33.300]  That is a cool shot.
[14:33.960 --> 14:35.460]  Ooh, Ramon Martinez.
[14:35.780 --> 14:36.600]  That's a long arm.
[14:37.020 --> 14:37.880]  Great, that is a long arm.
[14:37.880 --> 14:39.840]  That is not natural.
[14:40.480 --> 14:43.360]  Ramon Martinez, fantastic... oh, fantastic pitcher.
[14:43.880 --> 14:45.940]  And then John Candelaria.
[14:47.000 --> 14:47.700]  Stretch Armstrong?
[14:47.960 --> 14:48.640]  Stretch Armstrong.
[14:48.940 --> 14:50.160]  All right, we'll do a Stretch Armstrong section.
[14:50.160 --> 14:50.780]  Damn.
[14:50.920 --> 14:55.760]  We were going to debut Common Thread this week, but once again, we can't because Eric's not here.
[14:55.840 --> 14:59.980]  But we'll get to that next week. I'm really excited about this new little bit, little inside game we're going to do.
[15:00.040 --> 15:01.820]  And we're going to try to do it each week or most weeks.
[15:02.680 --> 15:09.160]  But right now, before I get too far ahead of myself, let's go ahead and look at last week's hits and see what the grades are, okay?
[15:09.200 --> 15:11.200]  Or what the prices are.
[15:11.300 --> 15:13.580]  Mickey Mouse foil from the Lorcana.
[15:13.820 --> 15:16.440]  Everybody's fucking going crazy trying to get Lorcana right now.
[15:16.920 --> 15:17.640]  Two dollars.
[15:18.160 --> 15:19.280]  Not going that crazy.
[15:20.180 --> 15:20.580]  Moana.
[15:21.300 --> 15:22.380]  She's going for about five.
[15:22.640 --> 15:23.620]  So, good for Moana.
[15:24.400 --> 15:25.320]  Now, here's the... you know what?
[15:25.320 --> 15:26.700]  I'll save the Maguire for the last.
[15:27.260 --> 15:30.420]  Ozzie Smith Chrome Atomic Red Refractor.
[15:30.480 --> 15:35.140]  I said this one was probably worth a little bit of money, and it is running about $20 right now.
[15:35.260 --> 15:35.320]  Dang.
[15:35.540 --> 15:36.320]  So, that's actually pretty good.
[15:37.080 --> 15:44.360]  To give you an idea of how UFC cards rank, this Charles Oliveira insert is about $2.
[15:45.120 --> 15:45.440]  Yeah.
[15:46.180 --> 15:50.020]  But, interestingly enough, there have been a ton of sales of this card.
[15:50.180 --> 15:50.440]  Really?
[15:50.600 --> 15:53.460]  Like, usually I find, like, three or four to comp from.
[15:53.820 --> 15:55.820]  I probably saw 15 or 16 of these.
[15:55.900 --> 16:00.000]  So, for whatever reason, people are into this card, or Charles, and they're looking to get it.
[16:00.100 --> 16:01.900]  Is he about to fight soon or something?
[16:02.020 --> 16:03.840]  Like, maybe he's going up against someone, and they want to get it.
[16:03.840 --> 16:04.960]  I think he is, or he just fought.
[16:05.960 --> 16:06.360]  Okay.
[16:07.000 --> 16:07.740]  John Morant.
[16:07.820 --> 16:10.380]  This was the recon numbered to $199.
[16:10.920 --> 16:12.580]  This sucker, running about eight bucks.
[16:13.140 --> 16:13.960]  So, not too bad.
[16:13.960 --> 16:18.040]  Here's the David Roddy Ricky Rookie insert from recon.
[16:18.320 --> 16:19.720]  I thought that would be fun to look up.
[16:19.860 --> 16:20.820]  It wasn't. $3.
[16:21.820 --> 16:23.200]  Here's a nice one.
[16:23.280 --> 16:28.820]  Remember, we pulled this LeBron James recon vector insert last year that was really pretty,
[16:28.920 --> 16:30.900]  and I thought, wow, that might actually be worth something.
[16:31.640 --> 16:33.800]  And it turns out it was.
[16:33.980 --> 16:34.960]  It was worth...
[16:35.800 --> 16:36.320]  Oh, shit.
[16:36.620 --> 16:37.100]  $30.
[16:37.700 --> 16:38.140]  There you go.
[16:38.400 --> 16:39.060]  That's good.
[16:39.360 --> 16:40.760]  Zombo, $2.
[16:41.300 --> 16:42.860]  Joe Sackick, $2.
[16:43.620 --> 16:48.820]  The Cora Jade Skateboarding Rookie card, five bucks.
[16:49.040 --> 16:50.140]  It's a fractal.
[16:50.880 --> 16:54.420]  Usman Dang Future Legends card, that one's $4.
[16:54.900 --> 16:59.600]  The Ariel foil from the Lord Connors shit, it's $5.
[17:00.080 --> 17:03.180]  Wayne Gretzky Scoring Leader, $5.
[17:03.760 --> 17:07.980]  And then the Mark McGuire that we were so excited to pull that's got really good centering,
[17:08.640 --> 17:09.900]  but maybe one soft edge.
[17:09.900 --> 17:12.960]  This is Mark McGuire's Topps Olympic Rookie card.
[17:13.820 --> 17:18.120]  A PSA 10, and I have lots of comps to go by.
[17:19.820 --> 17:24.200]  A PSA 10 of this card will net you $4,000 to $5,000.
[17:24.640 --> 17:25.300]  Are you serious?
[17:25.660 --> 17:25.960]  Yeah.
[17:26.220 --> 17:27.240]  Oh, my God.
[17:27.420 --> 17:28.860]  Yeah, it's about a $5,000 card.
[17:29.340 --> 17:32.040]  There's a version of it, the Tiffany version, which if you don't know,
[17:32.080 --> 17:35.180]  it's a different version of the card that's got a shiny clear back.
[17:35.400 --> 17:37.360]  This is obviously the regular Topps version.
[17:37.360 --> 17:41.660]  The Topps Tiffany version, some of those have sold for as much as $20,000.
[17:41.940 --> 17:42.180]  What?
[17:42.460 --> 17:42.640]  Yeah.
[17:42.940 --> 17:44.280]  We could get a Jet Ski with that.
[17:44.460 --> 17:47.400]  We could buy two used Jet Skis or one new Jet Ski with that.
[17:48.600 --> 17:51.000]  So I thought a fun thing to do, we've talked about this for a while.
[17:51.680 --> 17:52.880]  I've never done this before in my life.
[17:53.700 --> 17:54.620]  I'm a little scared to do it.
[17:54.740 --> 17:56.620]  I always get close to doing it and then I back out.
[17:57.220 --> 17:59.420]  I'm going to send this off to PSA and get it graded.
[17:59.540 --> 18:01.820]  And then I will bring you guys along for the process,
[18:02.060 --> 18:03.840]  and we'll get this card graded together.
[18:03.840 --> 18:07.540]  We'll see how long it takes, see how much it costs to get graded,
[18:07.900 --> 18:10.160]  see what value we get in return for it.
[18:10.500 --> 18:12.220]  And maybe we'll get lucky.
[18:12.540 --> 18:14.280]  What do you know about the process so far?
[18:14.760 --> 18:17.420]  Do you just mail it in like a regular mailer?
[18:17.580 --> 18:18.420]  Do they send you...?
[18:18.420 --> 18:20.060]  You mail it in in your own mailer.
[18:20.280 --> 18:22.200]  Most people put them in this thing called a card saver.
[18:22.680 --> 18:26.100]  I'll probably put it in the top loader in the card saver,
[18:26.260 --> 18:27.440]  and then you send it to them.
[18:27.700 --> 18:30.740]  You can do bulk or individual, and there's different pricing
[18:30.740 --> 18:32.740]  depending on how valuable the card is.
[18:32.740 --> 18:36.040]  Because this is a $4,000 or $5,000 card, potentially,
[18:36.180 --> 18:38.660]  it could be a little more expensive to grade.
[18:38.840 --> 18:40.800]  Do you think that if you were to do...
[18:40.800 --> 18:44.180]  Because you have a lot of other cards that you would like to get graded,
[18:44.600 --> 18:46.140]  some of them are MicroSmarts and stuff,
[18:46.240 --> 18:47.060]  or other ones you've pulled.
[18:47.560 --> 18:50.140]  Is it better to just send them all at once?
[18:50.200 --> 18:53.000]  I think you get a price break if you send it in bulk.
[18:53.240 --> 18:54.820]  But for the purposes of this show...
[18:54.820 --> 18:56.000]  They also take longer to get back.
[18:56.220 --> 18:59.600]  For the purposes of this show, I just want to send this off solo by itself.
[19:00.080 --> 19:02.160]  Maybe not the cheapest way I can,
[19:02.360 --> 19:04.360]  but I don't want to pay for rush return or anything.
[19:05.380 --> 19:08.940]  I've seen the more expensive cards, they can be like $2,000 to grade.
[19:09.200 --> 19:10.420]  I don't want to pay $2,000 to get...
[19:10.420 --> 19:11.620]  Obviously, it's only worth $4,000 or $5,000.
[19:11.880 --> 19:14.940]  But I don't want to even pay a couple hundred bucks
[19:14.940 --> 19:16.520]  if I can get this graded for like $20,000.
[19:16.900 --> 19:17.880]  How much did you say?
[19:18.500 --> 19:19.280]  $4,000 to $5,000.
[19:19.380 --> 19:20.560]  What do you think it's at?
[19:20.640 --> 19:23.480]  If you were to guess what the grading is on it,
[19:24.620 --> 19:25.740]  what are you looking for?
[19:26.740 --> 19:27.820]  I'm looking for edges.
[19:27.820 --> 19:29.440]  They don't seem soft here.
[19:30.140 --> 19:33.880]  You got to look for imperfections in the cover of the card.
[19:34.320 --> 19:35.240]  Centering is a big deal.
[19:36.400 --> 19:38.280]  I think we'd be...
[19:38.280 --> 19:40.480]  I mean, a 10, we could buy a Jet Ski and that'd be amazing.
[19:40.560 --> 19:41.160]  That'd be awesome.
[19:41.340 --> 19:44.180]  And then if this thing grades at a 10 and I sell it for $5,000,
[19:44.440 --> 19:45.980]  everybody gets one lap on the Jet Ski.
[19:46.200 --> 19:47.020]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:47.280 --> 19:48.580]  But they have to go by the Swan.
[19:49.780 --> 19:52.860]  It's a lap around the Swan, so it's like Swan roulette.
[19:53.140 --> 19:55.320]  But I don't know, I'm hoping for a 9.
[19:55.700 --> 19:56.980]  A 10 would be...
[19:56.980 --> 20:01.900]  It's really hard to get 10s on Junk Air Wax
[20:01.900 --> 20:03.620]  because a lot of them didn't survive well.
[20:03.880 --> 20:06.980]  But also, there are just so many of them
[20:06.980 --> 20:08.660]  that I think it impacts the grading.
[20:08.780 --> 20:11.540]  They grade harder on these because there are so many of them.
[20:12.100 --> 20:15.980]  So I think that they would grade this card harder, for instance,
[20:16.200 --> 20:17.300]  than they'll grade this card.
[20:17.500 --> 20:18.500]  That is so cool.
[20:18.660 --> 20:19.820]  Yeah, so we'll see.
[20:20.400 --> 20:22.880]  But it's the first real big, huge, like...
[20:22.880 --> 20:24.780]  Not the first big, huge hit we've got,
[20:24.780 --> 20:27.960]  but it's the first hit that we were looking for that we've got.
[20:28.080 --> 20:29.460]  So I'm just jazzed about that.
[20:29.540 --> 20:31.280]  You were looking for it back then, too.
[20:31.600 --> 20:32.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[20:32.420 --> 20:34.380]  But there was no way in hell I was going to get it when I was a kid.
[20:34.460 --> 20:36.860]  Took you some time to get it, but you eventually got it.
[20:36.900 --> 20:38.140]  I did eventually get it.
[20:38.260 --> 20:39.200]  And I got a hit last week.
[20:39.280 --> 20:40.320]  Oh, yeah, and then you got...
[20:40.320 --> 20:42.100]  Emily, you got your 1990 Barbie hit,
[20:42.220 --> 20:44.320]  and so you were so excited because you had that Barbie.
[20:44.480 --> 20:45.380]  This is her dress.
[20:45.480 --> 20:47.420]  This is what it looks like now on Weird Barbie
[20:47.420 --> 20:49.160]  after it's played with for a while.
[20:49.240 --> 20:51.460]  So that's your Jasper Barbie, as they say?
[20:51.540 --> 20:51.780]  Yeah.
[20:52.040 --> 20:52.620]  Kate McKinnon Barbie?
[20:52.620 --> 20:55.620]  Yeah, this is my Weird Barbie that I practice haircuts on,
[20:56.180 --> 20:58.300]  and so she got a cool, like, asymmetrical cut.
[20:58.460 --> 21:01.200]  But, yeah, the dress looked like this when I got it,
[21:01.300 --> 21:03.060]  and then it looks like...
[21:03.060 --> 21:04.360]  Her boobies can't stay in it.
[21:04.460 --> 21:05.400]  They're having a hard time.
[21:06.480 --> 21:07.660]  It looks like that now.
[21:07.940 --> 21:09.820]  So how old were you when you cut her hair?
[21:10.460 --> 21:11.780]  I mean, I don't know.
[21:12.060 --> 21:13.600]  I cut their hair.
[21:13.700 --> 21:16.220]  I quickly learned that I couldn't curl their hair
[21:16.220 --> 21:18.700]  after I ruined a few of my mom's curling iron.
[21:18.700 --> 21:19.880]  It didn't help. It was plastic.
[21:20.720 --> 21:22.140]  So my mom would come in and be like,
[21:22.240 --> 21:23.840]  Oh, did you curl their hair again?
[21:24.200 --> 21:25.540]  And I had to get a new curling iron.
[21:26.520 --> 21:29.200]  I don't know. It could have been when I was 8, 9.
[21:29.340 --> 21:32.020]  So 8 or 9, you already knew you were going to be a stylist someday.
[21:32.980 --> 21:33.180]  Yeah.
[21:33.320 --> 21:35.700]  Did you think at 8 or 9 years old that you'd own your own salon?
[21:36.140 --> 21:36.420]  No.
[21:36.760 --> 21:37.020]  No?
[21:37.320 --> 21:37.600]  No.
[21:37.880 --> 21:38.840]  You didn't dare to dream?
[21:39.040 --> 21:40.260]  No, I didn't. No.
[21:40.380 --> 21:41.320]  I think I just wanted to be Barbie.
[21:41.560 --> 21:43.180]  I was like, I can be every job.
[21:43.300 --> 21:44.460]  I don't know. I just want to be her.
[21:45.040 --> 21:46.540]  All right, let's open up some of these other cards.
[21:46.900 --> 21:47.780]  I'm excited about this.
[21:47.780 --> 21:53.740]  These are first 1994 edition Beavis and Budhead cards from Flir Ultra.
[21:54.060 --> 21:55.600]  Most of the new packs I bought.
[21:55.740 --> 21:58.700]  I went on a little shopping spree on eBay a couple weeks ago.
[21:58.940 --> 22:00.860]  And some of these are pretty expensive.
[22:01.140 --> 22:03.000]  I was disappointed at how much that cost to get these,
[22:03.060 --> 22:04.860]  but I'm excited to open them up and let's see.
[22:04.960 --> 22:07.480]  All right, Freak Chicks Rule.
[22:07.760 --> 22:08.200]  Hell yeah.
[22:12.540 --> 22:14.540]  What does that say? Good credit.
[22:16.080 --> 22:17.820]  It's so funny because I don't remember any of these.
[22:17.820 --> 22:20.960]  I've watched every episode of the new Beavis and Budheads,
[22:21.160 --> 22:23.120]  but it's Cashier.
[22:23.220 --> 22:24.260]  I don't remember any of the old stuff.
[22:24.280 --> 22:24.920]  Oh, there's Todd.
[22:26.080 --> 22:26.960]  Todd was cool.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.220]  Todd looks like a dude that drives a Camaro.
[22:30.300 --> 22:31.760]  Can you watch old episodes somewhere?
[22:31.900 --> 22:32.540]  I think so.
[22:33.020 --> 22:33.400]  Probably somewhere.
[22:33.720 --> 22:34.380]  You should watch them.
[22:35.560 --> 22:37.540]  Oh, there's Beavis with a shark tattoo.
[22:37.840 --> 22:37.960]  Sick.
[22:38.340 --> 22:39.260]  Here we have...
[22:41.860 --> 22:43.900]  That was you holding my Barbie just now.
[22:44.880 --> 22:46.080]  And me showing it to you.
[22:46.780 --> 22:48.560]  Here we go. I'm like, Beavis?
[22:49.620 --> 22:51.960]  And then, Go Petitioning.
[22:53.480 --> 22:57.840]  And then, second to last, Jail Guy.
[22:58.860 --> 22:59.620]  He took his eyeball out.
[22:59.620 --> 23:00.920]  He took his eye out? Oof.
[23:01.120 --> 23:03.380]  And then, instead of androids, they are and dudes.
[23:04.440 --> 23:06.500]  That's like when we watch Terminator.
[23:07.060 --> 23:07.980]  I gotta be honest with you.
[23:08.360 --> 23:09.640]  I feel like every one of these is it.
[23:10.020 --> 23:12.160]  I mean, they're all great. We should just leave them all.
[23:12.240 --> 23:13.680]  We should put them in one of my sheets.
[23:13.680 --> 23:17.460]  First pack of non-sports cards we've opened where I've enjoyed every card.
[23:17.860 --> 23:18.880]  I thought, oh, these are great.
[23:19.140 --> 23:21.680]  They're all... I'm gonna put it in its own... butthead.
[23:22.440 --> 23:26.380]  I'm gonna open up these... let's do some Batman Forever cards.
[23:26.900 --> 23:30.400]  Is this the one that had Alicia Silverstone in it?
[23:30.680 --> 23:31.660]  And, oh yeah, it had Chris O'Donnell.
[23:31.880 --> 23:33.300]  Yeah, it had Chris O'Donnell in it. Yeah, this was that one.
[23:33.380 --> 23:34.880]  Is this the one that's supposed to be the worst one, right?
[23:35.140 --> 23:36.220]  People didn't like it.
[23:36.280 --> 23:37.600]  Yeah, people weren't crazy about it.
[23:37.700 --> 23:39.160]  Here's Robin Under Glass.
[23:39.220 --> 23:43.400]  I actually pulled that in the Daily Rip I did earlier today.
[23:44.400 --> 23:48.460]  Oh no, Edward Nygma's too far gone.
[23:49.440 --> 23:51.200]  And then he's victorious.
[23:51.900 --> 23:54.480]  It looks like he's caught in a squat.
[23:55.800 --> 23:57.560]  Oh, here we have...
[23:58.960 --> 24:00.020]  Striking Back.
[24:00.340 --> 24:01.580]  Robin Heavy.
[24:01.860 --> 24:02.500]  Pretty Robin Heavy.
[24:02.820 --> 24:05.900]  This is the one where they had nipples on their suits.
[24:05.980 --> 24:08.420]  Yes, the suits had armor nipples.
[24:09.160 --> 24:10.240]  Bye-bye Batcave.
[24:11.260 --> 24:12.340]  Oh, this is a cool card.
[24:12.340 --> 24:13.360]  Just Batman.
[24:13.960 --> 24:14.820]  Batman being Batman.
[24:15.060 --> 24:15.780]  That's a good one.
[24:15.900 --> 24:16.360]  Yeah, it is.
[24:16.680 --> 24:18.680]  Oh no, Batman's crashing the party.
[24:19.500 --> 24:22.540]  That's when he came in from the top, I think at the...
[24:22.540 --> 24:23.960]  Is this the Poison Ivy one or no?
[24:24.600 --> 24:26.240]  Gosh, I think everybody was in this one.
[24:26.580 --> 24:30.160]  It looks similar to...
[24:30.160 --> 24:31.500]  No, this was...
[24:31.500 --> 24:32.700]  I don't know if this or Freeze was in this one.
[24:32.760 --> 24:35.300]  This was the Two-Face and Riddler one.
[24:35.960 --> 24:37.180]  Oh, and then here's the lenticular.
[24:37.740 --> 24:38.340]  This is...
[24:39.620 --> 24:40.980]  I am Batman.
[24:41.740 --> 24:43.780]  That's when he's...
[24:44.520 --> 24:44.920]  Cool.
[24:45.360 --> 24:47.820]  It's like he got out of his straitjacket.
[24:47.940 --> 24:48.920]  Would you say that's a 10?
[24:50.240 --> 24:50.860]  A 10?
[24:51.040 --> 24:52.360]  Like I graded a PSA 10.
[24:52.600 --> 24:52.980]  Oh, it is?
[24:53.000 --> 24:53.660]  How's the quality on that card?
[24:53.900 --> 24:55.020]  Could be. Could be a 10.
[24:55.240 --> 24:55.980]  Yeah, it looks good.
[24:56.160 --> 24:56.360]  Okay.
[24:56.820 --> 24:57.140]  Alright.
[24:57.700 --> 24:59.260]  Looks like a prism.
[25:01.100 --> 25:01.500]  Let's...
[25:02.060 --> 25:04.720]  I want to hold off on some of these for a minute.
[25:05.040 --> 25:07.080]  Let's open up some football.
[25:07.640 --> 25:08.440]  This is numbered.
[25:08.640 --> 25:09.000]  That's lame.
[25:10.500 --> 25:12.120]  36 of 36. Huh.
[25:12.600 --> 25:14.140]  I don't think it's numbered in that way.
[25:14.340 --> 25:16.800]  I think it's just numbered 36 out of the set.
[25:17.760 --> 25:20.320]  How about some NBA mosaics?
[25:22.100 --> 25:23.400]  Let's open up the...
[25:23.400 --> 25:25.240]  I just picked these up at Barnes & Noble.
[25:26.940 --> 25:28.000]  A little pro tip for you.
[25:28.140 --> 25:29.380]  Barnes & Noble has lots of cards.
[25:30.280 --> 25:31.480]  Nobody seems to know about it.
[25:32.280 --> 25:34.040]  I probably shouldn't have said that.
[25:34.160 --> 25:35.000]  The Barnes & Noble and Austin...
[25:35.760 --> 25:37.500]  There's three of them and they all have cards.
[25:37.500 --> 25:40.240]  That's not helping your argument of not telling people.
[25:40.400 --> 25:41.320]  You're just getting more specific.
[25:41.360 --> 25:41.700]  You know what?
[25:42.180 --> 25:45.120]  This hobby is about sharing the wealth and sharing the love.
[25:45.360 --> 25:50.520]  Just because I have a fucking honeypot of basketball cards I can get from Barnes & Noble
[25:50.520 --> 25:51.580]  doesn't mean I shouldn't share them.
[25:51.760 --> 25:57.860]  I will say that you're very good about if there's like three boxes on the shelf,
[25:58.060 --> 25:59.580]  you'll only grab one or two.
[25:59.820 --> 26:01.600]  You never clear a shelf.
[26:01.680 --> 26:03.420]  You always got to leave product for the kids.
[26:03.560 --> 26:04.460]  You can't take it all.
[26:04.500 --> 26:05.020]  It's so rude.
[26:05.180 --> 26:06.260]  That's something I admire about you.
[26:06.260 --> 26:07.280]  Oh, thank you, sweetie.
[26:07.320 --> 26:08.720]  I admire lots about you.
[26:09.040 --> 26:11.120]  Not the least of which that outfit, which I think is gorgeous.
[26:11.120 --> 26:11.540]  Cutie tootie, right?
[26:11.760 --> 26:12.420]  Super cutie tootie.
[26:12.720 --> 26:15.640]  We're going to fill the pack sack as we do every time.
[26:17.120 --> 26:18.920]  I need an eating noise.
[26:20.460 --> 26:21.420]  You can just do that.
[26:23.220 --> 26:23.780]  That's good.
[26:24.880 --> 26:25.320]  All right.
[26:25.340 --> 26:27.400]  Now in these, you're looking for Palo rookies.
[26:27.600 --> 26:29.740]  You're looking for Benedict rookies.
[26:29.860 --> 26:30.740]  Jabari Smith, maybe.
[26:31.220 --> 26:35.640]  You're probably not looking for Dennis Schroeder, although he is a world champion now.
[26:35.640 --> 26:36.760]  Played for Team Germany.
[26:37.120 --> 26:38.020]  Oh, he did.
[26:38.140 --> 26:39.580]  Yeah, fucking knocked the U.S. out.
[26:40.080 --> 26:41.460]  C.J. McCullum.
[26:42.340 --> 26:43.400]  D'Angelo Russell.
[26:43.640 --> 26:45.480]  Probably one of the least liked guys.
[26:45.640 --> 26:45.900]  Why?
[26:46.100 --> 26:46.960]  In locker rooms.
[26:47.120 --> 26:49.780]  He's just, people don't, don't dig him.
[26:49.960 --> 26:51.660]  Is he just not nice, or is he toxic?
[26:52.260 --> 26:53.480]  You know, I haven't met him personally.
[26:53.600 --> 26:54.620]  I just know he has a bad reputation.
[26:54.940 --> 27:00.020]  He's the guy that outed Nick Young for cheating on Iggy Italia and then got traded to the Nets for it.
[27:00.400 --> 27:02.360]  I can see they get a little upset about it.
[27:02.480 --> 27:03.640]  But that was years and years and years ago.
[27:03.640 --> 27:05.880]  But apparently people have issues with him on top of that.
[27:06.840 --> 27:07.440]  Dylan Brooks.
[27:07.820 --> 27:11.060]  Oh, here's a silver mosaic Kevin Love.
[27:11.520 --> 27:11.820]  Ooh.
[27:12.300 --> 27:12.600]  Cool.
[27:14.820 --> 27:19.620]  Are you feeling just kind of like, how are you feeling about prisms this year, or mosaics this year?
[27:19.660 --> 27:20.400]  Are you just kind of like, whatever?
[27:20.500 --> 27:21.740]  I'm just getting into them.
[27:22.000 --> 27:22.920]  So I don't really know.
[27:22.980 --> 27:23.740]  But you're just like, whatever.
[27:24.140 --> 27:24.900]  Oh, I'm just not.
[27:24.980 --> 27:27.640]  I mean, it's like, it's always so cool to get a silver prism card.
[27:27.900 --> 27:29.500]  But then it's like, oh, cool, Kevin Young.
[27:29.500 --> 27:34.120]  And probably his last year in the NBA, it kind of saps the enthusiasm.
[27:34.340 --> 27:35.740]  Unless you PC Kevin Love.
[27:35.980 --> 27:39.340]  This Desmond Bain green prism...
[27:39.340 --> 27:39.740]  That's cool.
[27:39.960 --> 27:40.760]  ...is nice, though.
[27:40.920 --> 27:42.220]  It'd be cool if it was adjacent to him.
[27:42.640 --> 27:43.460]  It would be cool if it was adjacent to him.
[27:43.460 --> 27:44.100]  Wouldn't that be cool, then?
[27:44.160 --> 27:45.740]  It'd be much better. It'd be color matched, too.
[27:46.140 --> 27:47.560]  All right, let's open up another pack of this.
[27:48.180 --> 27:49.720]  How's everybody doing out there in the world?
[27:49.880 --> 27:54.160]  I guess I can only talk to you. I can't hear you talk back to me.
[27:55.300 --> 27:56.540]  But I'm going to assume you said great.
[27:56.600 --> 27:58.220]  I'm going to assume you said you had an awesome day.
[27:58.320 --> 27:59.220]  So I'm glad you did.
[27:59.220 --> 28:00.120]  Me, too.
[28:00.200 --> 28:01.720]  Jared Vanderbilt.
[28:05.000 --> 28:05.760]  Zach Levine.
[28:06.080 --> 28:08.540]  I was going to try to make a Vanderbilt joke there, but I couldn't come up with one.
[28:10.420 --> 28:11.180]  Marcus SmartBase.
[28:11.680 --> 28:11.820]  What?
[28:14.960 --> 28:15.620]  That's not bad.
[28:15.940 --> 28:16.480]  I know.
[28:17.140 --> 28:18.740]  Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
[28:18.780 --> 28:19.320]  That's better.
[28:19.460 --> 28:19.820]  That's better.
[28:21.820 --> 28:22.580]  How are you feeling?
[28:23.020 --> 28:24.620]  Sad. Sad about Marcus Smart.
[28:24.760 --> 28:26.250]  You mentioned the other day that you...
[28:27.520 --> 28:28.360]  I just got hit.
[28:28.360 --> 28:29.900]  You haven't processed it.
[28:31.160 --> 28:32.300]  Here's what I'm worried about.
[28:34.060 --> 28:36.600]  Fuck the playoffs. We're just talking regular season.
[28:36.920 --> 28:38.580]  I watch every preseason game.
[28:38.900 --> 28:41.940]  And then I watch 82 Celtics games a year.
[28:42.060 --> 28:43.460]  There are 82 games. I watch all 82.
[28:44.300 --> 28:49.400]  My favorite player on Earth since 2015 has been Marcus Smart.
[28:50.960 --> 28:52.360]  He now plays for the Memphis Grizzlies.
[28:52.500 --> 28:53.420]  A team who I like.
[28:54.060 --> 28:55.780]  I like Desmond Bain a lot.
[28:55.780 --> 29:04.700]  Until the FIBA games, I really liked J.J.J., but he did not show up for the U.S.
[29:04.880 --> 29:05.920]  Who's J.J.J.?
[29:05.920 --> 29:07.120]  Joshua Jackson, Jr.
[29:08.380 --> 29:11.120]  Then I really like John Morant, if he can stay out of trouble.
[29:11.520 --> 29:13.680]  So I'm excited about Marcus Smart going to that team.
[29:13.760 --> 29:16.680]  I think he fits in with the whole grit and grind mentality of Memphis.
[29:16.900 --> 29:19.180]  They call their stadium the Grindhouse for a reason.
[29:20.760 --> 29:23.180]  And I think that he is perfectly suited to that.
[29:23.860 --> 29:27.000]  If he has to go anywhere, I'm happy that's where he's going.
[29:27.300 --> 29:32.860]  I'm just a little confused as to how I'm going to now add 82 games into my year.
[29:32.860 --> 29:36.680]  I'm not going to watch less Celtics, but I can't watch less Marcus Smart.
[29:37.280 --> 29:40.760]  So I went from having to watch 82 games a year to 164.
[29:40.860 --> 29:43.080]  That's a fucking baseball season right there.
[29:43.140 --> 29:44.600]  That's how many games are in an MLB season.
[29:45.500 --> 29:48.220]  I don't know how realistically it's going to work,
[29:48.300 --> 29:51.400]  especially now that I'm playing video games from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. every night.
[29:51.400 --> 29:55.760]  Now I've got to fit in 82 two-and-a-half-hour games into my schedule.
[29:55.960 --> 29:57.160]  I don't know how it's going.
[29:57.200 --> 30:00.520]  So All Right comes out every week and comes out every Tuesday for everybody.
[30:00.640 --> 30:02.300]  I still have to make 2,000 podcasts.
[30:02.420 --> 30:03.020]  Oh, that's another thing.
[30:04.280 --> 30:08.340]  I should have mentioned this earlier, but yes, there were some teases of some announcements
[30:08.340 --> 30:13.220]  for some new Fuck Face content that will be coming out pretty soon.
[30:13.700 --> 30:14.960]  Yes, we are excited about them.
[30:15.620 --> 30:17.060]  Yes, there's more to come.
[30:17.820 --> 30:19.080]  Listen to this week's Fuck Face.
[30:20.460 --> 30:21.900]  And definitely listen to next week's.
[30:21.960 --> 30:24.580]  I think we get into it a little bit more in that one.
[30:24.900 --> 30:26.460]  But yes, we're pretty excited.
[30:26.520 --> 30:29.260]  We've got some stuff in the works for Fuck Face,
[30:29.440 --> 30:32.320]  which is going to give us more content on a regular basis
[30:32.320 --> 30:34.140]  and I think stuff that we're really excited about
[30:34.140 --> 30:36.700]  and that we've been working on in the background very quietly.
[30:36.820 --> 30:37.580]  I'm excited about it.
[30:37.580 --> 30:38.300]  For a couple of months.
[30:38.440 --> 30:39.360]  It's going to be so good.
[30:41.160 --> 30:42.360]  Marcus Smart also just got married.
[30:42.680 --> 30:44.540]  Marcus Smart did also just get married.
[30:45.120 --> 30:46.900]  I know. I saw Jason Tatum was at his wedding.
[30:46.900 --> 30:50.080]  And Daddy Braddy was at his wedding.
[30:50.820 --> 30:52.740]  And Joe Mazzuolo was at his wedding.
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.100]  And JB was at his wedding.
[30:54.320 --> 30:55.040]  And Grant Williams.
[30:55.200 --> 30:55.740]  And Dee White.
[30:55.880 --> 30:58.980]  And it was cool to see the love from the Celtics brothers
[30:58.980 --> 30:59.940]  even though he's now a...
[30:59.940 --> 31:00.640]  He deserves it.
[31:00.660 --> 31:01.300]  ...a Grizz.
[31:02.160 --> 31:05.200]  Anthony Edwards Elevate Parallel.
[31:05.280 --> 31:06.160]  That's a cute card.
[31:06.520 --> 31:07.300]  Let's leave that.
[31:07.540 --> 31:07.840]  Okay.
[31:08.260 --> 31:11.240]  Then we have, ooh, Josh Monat rookie.
[31:11.580 --> 31:12.540]  Oh, that's pretty.
[31:12.640 --> 31:13.140]  That's cool.
[31:13.960 --> 31:14.400]  Nice.
[31:14.600 --> 31:15.840]  And then, boom!
[31:16.480 --> 31:16.960]  Whoa.
[31:17.080 --> 31:23.220]  We got a Scotty Pippen Jr. Scripps auto.
[31:24.240 --> 31:25.340]  You know what's interesting about this?
[31:26.100 --> 31:28.840]  This is the second Scotty Pippen Jr. auto I've pulled.
[31:29.260 --> 31:33.960]  What if you collect the most Scotty Pippen Jr. autos?
[31:34.280 --> 31:35.340]  What if I just...
[31:35.340 --> 31:36.340]  What if we started a collection...
[31:36.340 --> 31:38.060]  That's great because I'm off to a great start.
[31:38.460 --> 31:42.300]  What if we started a collection that was just famous NBA players' kids?
[31:42.320 --> 31:42.740]  Yes.
[31:43.360 --> 31:44.500]  Gary Payton Jr.
[31:44.720 --> 31:45.060]  Bronny.
[31:45.640 --> 31:47.020]  Bronny when he makes it in.
[31:47.160 --> 31:47.980]  Scotty Pippen Jr.
[31:50.420 --> 31:51.460]  Tim Hardaway Jr.
[31:51.800 --> 31:52.660]  There's a ton, right?
[31:53.380 --> 31:54.400]  Larry Nance Jr.
[31:54.680 --> 31:56.620]  So this is...
[31:56.620 --> 31:57.560]  That's cool.
[31:57.700 --> 31:58.560]  That's a cool hit.
[31:58.880 --> 31:59.020]  Yeah.
[31:59.200 --> 32:02.900]  Still be determined if Scotty Pippen Jr. will be anything like his father in the NBA,
[32:03.060 --> 32:05.960]  but he's on a good team to figure it out.
[32:06.500 --> 32:07.000]  He plays for the Lakers?
[32:07.240 --> 32:07.420]  Yeah.
[32:07.500 --> 32:08.480]  And that's what...
[32:08.480 --> 32:08.800]  That is a gorgeous...
[32:08.800 --> 32:10.460]  No, Scotty Pippen played for the Bulls, right?
[32:10.460 --> 32:11.540]  Scotty Pippen played for the Bulls.
[32:11.600 --> 32:12.040]  Look at me.
[32:12.140 --> 32:12.340]  Look at you.
[32:12.340 --> 32:12.880]  Look at me.
[32:13.240 --> 32:13.880]  Look at her.
[32:14.020 --> 32:14.560]  Look at her.
[32:14.660 --> 32:15.660]  She can do it all.
[32:15.680 --> 32:16.420]  Got a cute outfit on.
[32:16.560 --> 32:18.040]  And she knows where Scotty Pippen played.
[32:18.280 --> 32:18.460]  Yeah.
[32:19.080 --> 32:20.880]  Because he was with Larsa Pippen.
[32:21.160 --> 32:21.560]  Right.
[32:21.560 --> 32:22.500]  Who was friends with the Kardashians.
[32:23.020 --> 32:24.680]  Is Scotty Pippen Jr. Larsa's kid?
[32:25.240 --> 32:26.580]  Or is that from a previous marriage?
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.160]  I would assume a previous marriage, but maybe.
[32:29.340 --> 32:30.280]  Kind of looks like her.
[32:30.700 --> 32:32.020]  I don't even know the answer to that.
[32:32.060 --> 32:32.480]  I don't know.
[32:32.540 --> 32:35.220]  I know that she's dating Michael Jordan's son.
[32:36.080 --> 32:41.040]  Yeah, she's currently dating MJ's son, which has caused some issues, I've read.
[32:41.040 --> 32:41.260]  Yeah.
[32:41.260 --> 32:51.240]  MJ and Scotty Pippen have kind of a love-hate relationship already, and now she's dating his son.
[32:51.380 --> 32:52.320]  Yeah, it's a whole thing.
[32:55.520 --> 32:59.420]  But by that token, if you're not watching The Real Housewives of Miami, you really should.
[32:59.840 --> 33:00.260]  That's a great show.
[33:00.500 --> 33:03.960]  Gary Trent Jr. Spencer Dinwiddie.
[33:04.040 --> 33:09.100]  Spencer Dinwiddie wants to take all of his earnings from the NBA and build a real-life Iron Man suit.
[33:10.660 --> 33:12.780]  Jose Alvarado. That's what he says.
[33:13.320 --> 33:15.120]  Jonathan Kaminga, second-year card.
[33:16.320 --> 33:17.440]  Shadon Sharp, rookie.
[33:17.660 --> 33:23.620]  I've noticed something. I don't... I guess it's the same for everybody, but you see how everybody's names are black on white?
[33:23.900 --> 33:28.300]  I've noticed on all the rookies in Mosaic, I'm assuming this is intentional, all the rookie names are white.
[33:28.480 --> 33:30.900]  I guess that's just to further denote their rookies.
[33:31.360 --> 33:32.080]  Hold on to that.
[33:32.200 --> 33:34.580]  Weird. And then, oh, Al Horford, color match.
[33:34.660 --> 33:36.300]  Fuck yeah, everything's coming up Geoff today.
[33:37.240 --> 33:37.840]  I'll take that.
[33:37.840 --> 33:39.500]  Fuck, it's simply too good.
[33:40.720 --> 33:42.240]  All right, we've got two more packs of this.
[33:42.720 --> 33:44.420]  Then we'll... maybe we'll open up Army of Darkness.
[33:44.720 --> 33:47.920]  I'm excited for when you're going to open up that bingo box.
[33:48.700 --> 33:50.760]  Oh yeah, we'll do that at the very end.
[33:50.760 --> 33:52.940]  I know, but I'm like... I'm just... I'm thinking about it.
[33:53.240 --> 33:53.680]  Giannis.
[33:55.300 --> 33:56.140]  Cam Johnson.
[33:58.400 --> 33:59.240]  Ben Simmons.
[34:01.040 --> 34:01.920]  Jose Valenzuelos.
[34:02.200 --> 34:05.740]  Is Ben Simmons playing better now, or is he still a little nervous?
[34:07.980 --> 34:09.780]  He's... not playing at all.
[34:10.040 --> 34:12.380]  He didn't play at all last year.
[34:13.900 --> 34:15.300]  Or the year before, or the year before.
[34:15.520 --> 34:16.760]  No, it's been a few years.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  He might have played a little bit early last year.
[34:19.560 --> 34:23.620]  He had some flashes of the old Ben Simmons and a lot of flashes of the current Ben Simmons.
[34:24.040 --> 34:28.160]  But there were supposedly some back injury stuff, which, who knows.
[34:28.880 --> 34:31.080]  But he seems to think that...
[34:31.080 --> 34:33.400]  He's been in the gym all summer, posting pictures of him in the gym.
[34:33.560 --> 34:36.740]  And then photoshopping pictures of him in the gym to look more muscular than he is.
[34:36.780 --> 34:38.640]  Which he doesn't need to do, because the dude's already...
[34:38.640 --> 34:40.160]  The dude's already, like...
[34:40.680 --> 34:42.060]  The dude's already fucking ripped and built.
[34:42.060 --> 34:43.460]  Did he get caught editing his photos?
[34:43.660 --> 34:44.920]  Somebody got caught editing his photos.
[34:45.900 --> 34:49.720]  But he says he's going to be competing for that starting slot this season, so...
[34:49.720 --> 34:50.360]  We'll see.
[34:50.540 --> 34:55.660]  I personally would like Ben Simmons to have a redemption, because he's no longer playing for the 76ers.
[34:55.660 --> 34:58.340]  Who are Celtics' most hated rivalry.
[35:00.100 --> 35:00.900]  The Nets?
[35:01.520 --> 35:05.100]  He's playing for the Nets now, which I got no issues with the Nets.
[35:05.140 --> 35:05.920]  I got no problems with them.
[35:06.960 --> 35:10.800]  But also, when he took his nosedive, I thought, oh, he'll rebound.
[35:10.920 --> 35:14.320]  He's a fucking three-time all-star, all-NBA defensive team.
[35:14.700 --> 35:17.360]  Like, this dude is clearly a superstar in the NBA.
[35:17.840 --> 35:18.740]  He'll get over this.
[35:18.980 --> 35:20.620]  And so I bought a shitload of his rookies.
[35:20.860 --> 35:21.980]  And he has not gotten over it.
[35:22.080 --> 35:24.960]  So if he recovers someday, we'll buy more jet skis.
[35:24.960 --> 35:26.440]  But until then...
[35:26.440 --> 35:27.800]  Everyone can get two laps on the jet ski.
[35:27.800 --> 35:28.680]  He sank our jet ski.
[35:29.760 --> 35:30.720]  Here we go.
[35:32.400 --> 35:33.280]  Alondez Williams.
[35:33.440 --> 35:34.320]  I'm not familiar with him.
[35:34.520 --> 35:35.440]  Oh, he's a rookie.
[35:35.980 --> 35:36.160]  Yeah.
[35:36.280 --> 35:37.800]  Oh, and this cute little insert.
[35:38.180 --> 35:38.820]  Give and go.
[35:39.000 --> 35:39.220]  Giddy.
[35:39.480 --> 35:40.060]  Giddy up.
[35:40.360 --> 35:41.960]  Is that the guy that looks like Timothy Chalamet?
[35:41.980 --> 35:44.200]  He's the Timothy Chalamet of the NBA, yeah.
[35:44.380 --> 35:46.580]  That is such an unfortunate pose, though.
[35:46.700 --> 35:47.400]  That's mean.
[35:47.640 --> 35:48.340]  Mean pose?
[35:48.940 --> 35:49.760]  That's unfortunate.
[35:49.760 --> 35:50.200]  Should be something.
[35:50.900 --> 35:52.380]  Alright, last pack of these bad boys.
[35:52.820 --> 35:53.600]  And then...
[35:53.600 --> 35:53.820]  Yeah.
[35:54.960 --> 35:56.780]  You know, I got new wrestling cards for Eric to speak in.
[35:56.840 --> 35:57.180]  He's not here.
[35:57.580 --> 35:58.260]  Next time.
[35:58.380 --> 35:58.840]  Next time.
[35:59.160 --> 36:01.000]  But not next time.
[36:02.320 --> 36:02.740]  Oh, right.
[36:02.800 --> 36:04.960]  I think we're not doing this next week because...
[36:07.260 --> 36:07.720]  Off topic.
[36:08.080 --> 36:11.620]  Because we're giving up the slot for off topic next week so they can record.
[36:12.100 --> 36:13.100]  But we'll be back the week after.
[36:13.480 --> 36:14.200]  Kyrie Irving.
[36:14.940 --> 36:15.340]  Oh.
[36:17.060 --> 36:17.660]  Thank you.
[36:17.900 --> 36:18.360]  Thank you.
[36:18.660 --> 36:22.520]  I wanna raise the number 11 to the rafters in Boston.
[36:22.660 --> 36:23.140]  Just kidding.
[36:23.280 --> 36:24.600]  I'm leaving to form a super team.
[36:24.960 --> 36:25.480]  Just kidding.
[36:25.500 --> 36:26.920]  I don't wanna play for that team either.
[36:28.040 --> 36:28.920]  Patrick Beverly.
[36:31.740 --> 36:32.920]  Eric's favorite basketball player.
[36:33.160 --> 36:33.420]  For real?
[36:33.580 --> 36:33.740]  Yeah.
[36:33.960 --> 36:34.580]  Darren Fox.
[36:34.820 --> 36:35.660]  Love Darren Fox.
[36:35.820 --> 36:36.500]  Josh Okogie.
[36:37.620 --> 36:38.840]  Oh, Oche Agabay, rookie.
[36:39.000 --> 36:39.380]  That's nice.
[36:39.440 --> 36:39.800]  I like him.
[36:39.980 --> 36:40.480]  That's nice.
[36:41.020 --> 36:43.780]  And then the green prism, Mason Plumlee.
[36:45.700 --> 36:46.180]  Cool.
[36:47.520 --> 36:49.200]  It's simply too good.
[36:49.500 --> 36:50.540]  The Plumlee wasn't, but yeah.
[36:50.960 --> 36:53.580]  Let's see what's in these Army of Darkness cards.
[36:54.020 --> 36:56.040]  Are you familiar with Army of Darkness?
[36:56.800 --> 36:57.140]  Yeah.
[36:58.120 --> 36:58.920]  I am not.
[36:59.040 --> 36:59.860]  Will you please tell me?
[37:00.180 --> 37:06.560]  When I was a teenage, Geoff thought Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, and Army of Darkness were the three best movies ever made.
[37:06.680 --> 37:06.880]  Okay.
[37:06.960 --> 37:09.660]  So this is the third in the series?
[37:09.660 --> 37:09.840]  This is the third one.
[37:09.920 --> 37:11.600]  This is the guy with the chainsaw arm?
[37:11.820 --> 37:12.120]  Yeah.
[37:12.260 --> 37:12.800]  Look at me.
[37:12.980 --> 37:13.960]  Ash is his name is.
[37:14.040 --> 37:14.240]  Okay.
[37:15.040 --> 37:17.820]  This is just a dirty hand.
[37:18.000 --> 37:19.400]  Is that before he turns into a chainsaw arm?
[37:19.400 --> 37:20.600]  I think, no, no.
[37:20.680 --> 37:23.900]  He loses his arm in Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2.
[37:24.160 --> 37:24.340]  Okay.
[37:24.400 --> 37:26.240]  Evil Dead 2 is a remake of Evil Dead 1.
[37:26.640 --> 37:28.740]  Evil Dead 1 is a straight horror film.
[37:28.840 --> 37:29.040]  Yeah.
[37:29.180 --> 37:31.300]  And it's really good and really scary and creepy.
[37:31.600 --> 37:38.000]  And then Evil Dead 2 is essentially, they got more money and so they wanted to remake it.
[37:38.060 --> 37:41.040]  And they remade it better in every way, but funnier in every way.
[37:41.120 --> 37:41.240]  Okay.
[37:41.240 --> 37:42.280]  So it's a horror comedy.
[37:42.760 --> 37:45.620]  And then Army of Darkness continues that rich tradition.
[37:45.800 --> 37:48.180]  So I've seen the first one, but I haven't seen the other ones.
[37:48.180 --> 37:49.180]  But this seems like it's good.
[37:49.180 --> 37:49.600]  Oh, baby.
[37:49.660 --> 37:50.460]  We're going to watch them all now.
[37:50.460 --> 37:51.000]  It's Halloween.
[37:51.420 --> 37:51.740]  It's starting to be.
[37:51.740 --> 37:53.080]  Speaking of Ash, there he is.
[37:53.580 --> 37:57.240]  This is the movie where he goes, all right, when he goes back in the old times and there's
[37:57.240 --> 37:59.220]  all these people like in a castle and like knights and shit.
[37:59.240 --> 38:01.500]  And he goes, all right, you primitive screwheads, listen up.
[38:01.580 --> 38:02.200]  He's got a shotgun.
[38:02.380 --> 38:04.020]  He goes, this is my boomstick.
[38:04.220 --> 38:05.100]  Yeah, that's fucking awesome.
[38:05.680 --> 38:06.380]  He's the best.
[38:06.480 --> 38:07.800]  Oh, there he is with his boomstick right there.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.020]  You can see he's got his, he's missing his arm.
[38:10.120 --> 38:11.700]  Is that a zombie behind her?
[38:12.080 --> 38:13.900]  Yeah, or not a zombie, but a demon.
[38:14.020 --> 38:14.540]  An undead.
[38:14.800 --> 38:15.280]  An undead.
[38:15.820 --> 38:16.840]  Ashes to ashes.
[38:16.840 --> 38:18.160]  That's the Necronomicon.
[38:18.520 --> 38:23.260]  That's an art card of the Necronomicon, the book of the dead that they read from that
[38:23.260 --> 38:25.540]  summons the demons that cause the whole problem.
[38:25.660 --> 38:26.600]  Like the book in Hocus Pocus.
[38:27.460 --> 38:29.120]  Exactly like the book in Hocus Pocus.
[38:29.580 --> 38:30.520]  Speaking of chainsaws.
[38:31.060 --> 38:31.500]  Hey.
[38:31.860 --> 38:32.920]  Oh, I think I have one.
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.860]  There's a picture of the chainsaw in what appears to be every yard in Texas this year.
[38:37.120 --> 38:38.040]  Just rocks.
[38:38.900 --> 38:39.720]  Just bleach rocks.
[38:39.900 --> 38:41.300]  Here's some skeletons.
[38:42.080 --> 38:43.880]  And then a little checklist card.
[38:44.040 --> 38:44.400]  That's cool.
[38:44.640 --> 38:44.840]  All right.
[38:44.840 --> 38:49.080]  Nothing crazy out of that, but nice to revisit our old friend Ash.
[38:49.460 --> 38:51.300]  And now we have something that we can watch.
[38:51.520 --> 38:52.740]  Yeah, now we have something that we can watch.
[38:53.200 --> 38:54.880]  Oh, I got a little surprise for you.
[38:54.980 --> 38:55.240]  What?
[38:55.480 --> 39:01.680]  So Emily and I have been talking off camera about that goddamn rip card that you forced
[39:01.680 --> 39:05.480]  me to open that turned 350 bucks into about 40.
[39:07.620 --> 39:09.620]  So she said, why don't you just get another rip card?
[39:09.720 --> 39:12.920]  And I was like, it's not that easy, Emily, because they only put one rip card in every
[39:12.920 --> 39:16.040]  12 fucking hobby cases, 12 fucking hobby boxes.
[39:16.260 --> 39:16.700]  Buy 12.
[39:16.720 --> 39:18.420]  And she goes, so you gotta buy 12 hobby boxes.
[39:18.820 --> 39:20.900]  And I didn't do that, but I bought a bunch.
[39:21.200 --> 39:22.100]  Here's the first one.
[39:23.280 --> 39:27.040]  We'll open a pack or two, but what we're really rooting for is the box top.
[39:27.220 --> 39:28.020]  Is a new rip card.
[39:28.220 --> 39:29.060]  We want a new rip card.
[39:29.200 --> 39:36.840]  What we'll probably get is a fucking, I don't know, probably a giant picture of a ham sandwich
[39:36.840 --> 39:39.180]  or something, but maybe.
[39:40.160 --> 39:40.580]  What was that?
[39:40.740 --> 39:41.180]  I don't know.
[39:41.180 --> 39:41.840]  I love this one, though.
[39:43.440 --> 39:45.060]  I don't know, but it's so cute.
[39:46.780 --> 39:47.420]  So we'll...
[39:47.780 --> 39:48.660]  I didn't get one?
[39:49.680 --> 39:50.140]  We don't know.
[39:50.220 --> 39:50.720]  Did you really?
[39:50.840 --> 39:52.740]  This is one oversized box loader card.
[39:52.820 --> 39:53.500]  We don't know what's in here.
[39:53.580 --> 39:54.580]  This could be a rip card.
[39:55.040 --> 39:56.820]  This could be just a large card.
[39:57.140 --> 39:57.360]  What?
[39:57.500 --> 39:57.860]  It could be.
[39:57.980 --> 39:58.260]  It's not.
[39:58.600 --> 39:59.560]  You only get one.
[39:59.660 --> 40:00.920]  You get this every box.
[40:00.960 --> 40:03.800]  You only get one rip card every 12 boxes or so.
[40:04.100 --> 40:05.060]  But it could be in this.
[40:05.180 --> 40:05.500]  Could be.
[40:06.540 --> 40:07.480]  Oh my God.
[40:08.800 --> 40:10.320]  Gotta figure out how to make money on this.
[40:10.320 --> 40:11.140]  I really want one.
[40:11.140 --> 40:11.580]  Is it one?
[40:11.720 --> 40:11.880]  No.
[40:12.120 --> 40:12.400]  What?
[40:12.900 --> 40:14.100]  Pedro Guerrero Jr.
[40:14.360 --> 40:15.020]  What's the difference?
[40:15.080 --> 40:15.680]  It looks the same.
[40:15.780 --> 40:16.880]  Sorry, Vladimir Guerrero Jr.
[40:17.380 --> 40:19.580]  You have received a cabinet box loader.
[40:19.720 --> 40:20.320]  That's all it is.
[40:20.440 --> 40:21.660]  Just a big version of the card.
[40:21.880 --> 40:22.080]  Oh.
[40:22.220 --> 40:23.640]  So don't worry.
[40:23.700 --> 40:26.840]  In another 11 more boxes of this bullshit, we'll get one maybe.
[40:29.260 --> 40:30.120]  What's his deal?
[40:30.340 --> 40:31.140]  Guerrero Jr.
[40:31.460 --> 40:33.740]  He just won the home run derby this year.
[40:33.800 --> 40:33.940]  That's so pretty cool.
[40:33.960 --> 40:35.680]  His dad is Vladimir Guerrero.
[40:36.760 --> 40:37.480]  Famous player.
[40:37.600 --> 40:39.080]  And he is also a famous player.
[40:39.160 --> 40:39.660]  Very good.
[40:39.660 --> 40:40.640]  Dad was good.
[40:40.780 --> 40:41.440]  He's good.
[40:41.500 --> 40:45.140]  We'll sacrifice one of these Alan and Ginter packs to the pack sack.
[40:45.220 --> 40:47.120]  This is last year's Alan and Ginter.
[40:48.240 --> 40:51.040]  I bought a bunch of boxes from the last, like, three or four years.
[40:51.100 --> 40:53.420]  Because every one supposedly has box tops in it.
[40:53.480 --> 40:54.260]  So maybe we'll get lucky.
[40:54.300 --> 40:55.180]  Or not box tops.
[40:55.380 --> 40:55.580]  I'm sorry.
[40:55.640 --> 40:56.020]  Ripped cards.
[40:56.100 --> 40:56.720]  Maybe we'll get lucky.
[40:56.800 --> 40:57.440]  Here's Garrett Cole.
[40:58.300 --> 40:59.620]  Here's Carlos Correa.
[41:02.280 --> 41:03.440]  Luis Gil rookie.
[41:03.740 --> 41:04.520]  Go ahead and sleeve that.
[41:05.580 --> 41:07.480]  We got Nick Allen rookie.
[41:07.700 --> 41:08.760]  Go ahead and sleeve that.
[41:08.760 --> 41:10.280]  I like how old timey these look.
[41:10.580 --> 41:12.200]  Yeah, I like how they have weird shit too.
[41:12.280 --> 41:13.440]  Like, here's Luke Westman.
[41:13.640 --> 41:15.620]  You probably don't know who Luke Westman is.
[41:15.680 --> 41:16.480]  He's doing the prayer hands.
[41:17.120 --> 41:18.780]  I didn't either, but I just read this.
[41:19.120 --> 41:19.960]  He is a tattoo.
[41:20.260 --> 41:22.260]  Globally celebrated tattoo artist.
[41:22.420 --> 41:23.000]  So there you go.
[41:23.220 --> 41:24.980]  Do you think you could get a card in this?
[41:25.560 --> 41:26.200]  I would love one.
[41:26.380 --> 41:28.800]  I don't know what you gotta do, but yeah, I would love one.
[41:28.820 --> 41:29.900]  I mean, this guy's a tattoo artist.
[41:30.120 --> 41:30.440]  You're...
[41:30.440 --> 41:31.300]  Oh, they have all kinds of stuff.
[41:31.560 --> 41:31.880]  You're...
[41:31.880 --> 41:32.620]  I know.
[41:32.680 --> 41:34.020]  You're fucking Geoff Ramsey, alright?
[41:37.620 --> 41:38.260]  Tyler Glasnow.
[41:39.000 --> 41:39.700]  Here we go.
[41:40.100 --> 41:41.880]  Here's from the baseball lexicon.
[41:42.240 --> 41:42.800]  Is it cheese?
[41:43.340 --> 41:44.000]  High cheese.
[41:44.760 --> 41:46.760]  There's a mini card of high cheese.
[41:47.560 --> 41:48.940]  That's a winner right there.
[41:49.160 --> 41:50.040]  The baseball lex...
[41:50.040 --> 41:51.500]  Is it something that you say in baseball?
[41:51.560 --> 41:51.940]  Cheese!
[41:52.300 --> 41:52.680]  No, no.
[41:52.720 --> 41:54.520]  They love to highlight non-sports stuff.
[41:54.640 --> 41:56.040]  Like, for instance, the last card in this pack.
[41:56.780 --> 41:57.580]  Italian sub.
[41:57.660 --> 41:58.120]  Oh, yum.
[41:58.580 --> 41:59.360]  Look at that.
[41:59.500 --> 42:00.520]  Doesn't that look delicious?
[42:00.660 --> 42:02.080]  I know what we're having for dinner.
[42:02.260 --> 42:03.340]  It's cheeseburger day.
[42:03.740 --> 42:04.100]  Oh, right.
[42:04.120 --> 42:05.540]  It's national cheeseburger day?
[42:05.700 --> 42:06.080]  Yeah.
[42:06.680 --> 42:07.740]  We gotta get a cheeseburger.
[42:07.740 --> 42:09.040]  I saw on all the...
[42:09.040 --> 42:13.220]  You know, I like to watch all the QAnon subreddits.
[42:13.600 --> 42:14.360]  Just because they're fucking...
[42:14.360 --> 42:19.180]  It's fun to watch how dumb and insane and unable to critically think they are.
[42:19.340 --> 42:19.540]  Uh-huh.
[42:19.680 --> 42:22.280]  And the new QAnon thing is they're like,
[42:22.340 --> 42:27.120]  don't eat a cheeseburger today because the big government or the...
[42:27.120 --> 42:32.340]  I don't know, the Illuminati or whoever's behind pulling the strings
[42:32.340 --> 42:35.700]  has decided they're going to reduce the global population to one billion.
[42:35.700 --> 42:39.160]  And the way they're going to do it is to give everybody cheap cheeseburgers today
[42:39.160 --> 42:40.280]  and then we'll all die.
[42:40.440 --> 42:40.880]  Hell yeah.
[42:41.060 --> 42:43.960]  If I died eating a cheeseburger, I would consider that to be a fucking win.
[42:44.120 --> 42:45.340]  Take me. Cheeseburger in paradise.
[42:45.420 --> 42:45.680]  That's right.
[42:45.880 --> 42:47.340]  I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go hang out with Jimmy again.
[42:47.440 --> 42:49.780]  Hang out with Jimmy. He can serenade me on the way in.
[42:49.860 --> 42:52.640]  Yeah. And everybody I'll be there are cheeseburger eaters.
[42:52.840 --> 42:55.140]  That's true. I bet that's what heaven is.
[42:55.240 --> 42:56.720]  It's just a bunch of people eating cheeseburgers.
[42:57.460 --> 42:58.520]  You can have vegan ones if you want.
[42:58.520 --> 43:01.360]  Jose Siri. Robin Yount.
[43:02.340 --> 43:05.180]  Oh, here you go. Ted Williams. Ted Brain-in-a-Jar Williams.
[43:05.760 --> 43:06.280]  That's crazy.
[43:06.520 --> 43:08.120]  Here we go. DJ Muggs.
[43:08.620 --> 43:10.440]  Okay, DJ Muggs has a card.
[43:10.860 --> 43:11.560]  Do you know who DJ Muggs is?
[43:11.580 --> 43:14.480]  We've got to get Alan or Ginter on the line and talk to them about...
[43:14.480 --> 43:16.200]  Hello, Ginter. Put Alan on.
[43:16.220 --> 43:16.800]  Put Alan on.
[43:16.900 --> 43:17.660]  I want to talk to both of you.
[43:18.420 --> 43:20.360]  He produced seven studio albums with a hit...
[43:20.360 --> 43:21.600]  Oh, he's from Cypress Hill. Okay.
[43:21.640 --> 43:23.300]  I just didn't know his name was DJ Muggs.
[43:23.340 --> 43:23.760]  He doesn't.
[43:25.280 --> 43:26.160]  Wilson Contreras.
[43:26.620 --> 43:28.960]  Here we go. Mr. Steroid himself, Mark McGuire.
[43:29.140 --> 43:31.100]  Hey, we saw him as a baby right here.
[43:31.600 --> 43:32.000]  We did.
[43:32.540 --> 43:35.400]  How it started, how it juiced.
[43:36.400 --> 43:37.200]  There you go.
[43:38.580 --> 43:39.020]  Beautiful.
[43:39.880 --> 43:40.820]  Oh, here's our mini card.
[43:41.020 --> 43:44.640]  Oh, it's a Whitey Herzog manager card.
[43:44.960 --> 43:47.100]  Now, this is nice. You see how it has this black border?
[43:47.520 --> 43:49.600]  You see how this one doesn't have a black border?
[43:49.740 --> 43:53.160]  That's a different card, but this is a parallel.
[43:53.160 --> 43:55.840]  So the black border is not normal.
[43:56.220 --> 43:58.620]  It's slightly rarer than the normal card.
[43:58.700 --> 44:00.900]  Maybe half as common.
[44:01.140 --> 44:02.040]  And it's a manager.
[44:02.560 --> 44:03.300]  Yeah, and it's a manager.
[44:03.420 --> 44:04.480]  We love and support managers.
[44:04.860 --> 44:10.360]  Oh, speaking of, here's the 1987 Rookie of the Year, Mark McGuire himself.
[44:10.560 --> 44:10.800]  Wow.
[44:11.440 --> 44:11.760]  There he goes.
[44:12.700 --> 44:15.060]  So what year is this one?
[44:15.380 --> 44:17.140]  This is 86 tops or 85 tops.
[44:17.160 --> 44:18.880]  So then he became Rookie of the Year.
[44:18.880 --> 44:20.540]  In 87, he was Rookie of the Year.
[44:20.540 --> 44:22.200]  But this is just Team USA.
[44:22.200 --> 44:23.260]  This is just on Team USA.
[44:23.440 --> 44:24.420]  This is the 85 tops.
[44:24.860 --> 44:27.220]  They printed just the Olympic team players.
[44:27.440 --> 44:28.600]  He was a college player.
[44:28.780 --> 44:29.160]  Oh, okay.
[44:29.480 --> 44:34.780]  And then this is his rookie year, 87, when he hit, I think, 49 home runs his rookie year.
[44:35.440 --> 44:37.200]  And then this is...
[44:37.200 --> 44:38.980]  Juiced up, cranking them.
[44:39.120 --> 44:41.020]  He was hitting like 62 home runs a year.
[44:41.160 --> 44:42.880]  That was like you whenever you hit baseball.
[44:43.060 --> 44:44.340]  It's just Mark McGuire.
[44:45.100 --> 44:48.520]  Well, he was my favorite baseball player growing up, so I learned.
[44:48.680 --> 44:49.220]  You watched.
[44:49.220 --> 44:49.660]  I know.
[44:51.900 --> 44:53.500]  One more pack of these bad boys.
[44:54.640 --> 44:57.280]  And then we'll open up some of the other new stuff I've got.
[44:57.440 --> 44:58.620]  Although I guess this is new, too.
[44:59.200 --> 45:00.400]  Everything's new if you haven't seen it yet.
[45:00.580 --> 45:00.780]  Yeah.
[45:01.980 --> 45:02.700]  Oh, fuck.
[45:02.800 --> 45:03.440]  That sucks.
[45:03.680 --> 45:03.920]  What's that?
[45:04.500 --> 45:05.120]  The Joe...
[45:05.120 --> 45:05.560]  I got a Joe...
[45:06.380 --> 45:07.100]  Fucking dickhead.
[45:07.480 --> 45:09.220]  Look at this Joe Ryan rookie card.
[45:09.700 --> 45:10.780]  Came in bent like that.
[45:10.900 --> 45:11.160]  Ew.
[45:11.260 --> 45:12.060]  That's fucking trash.
[45:12.360 --> 45:13.040]  That would have been a card.
[45:13.200 --> 45:13.860]  That would have been okay.
[45:14.560 --> 45:15.100]  Oh, boy.
[45:15.340 --> 45:16.160]  Yeah, oh, boy.
[45:16.300 --> 45:16.860]  Oh, boy.
[45:16.860 --> 45:18.120]  Eloy Jimenez.
[45:18.380 --> 45:19.040]  Not a leader.
[45:19.580 --> 45:19.980]  Mike Trout.
[45:21.300 --> 45:23.320]  If we were trout fishing, we would have caught one.
[45:24.740 --> 45:25.540]  Reese Hoskins.
[45:27.220 --> 45:28.020]  Jared Walsh.
[45:30.040 --> 45:30.840]  Andrew McCutcheon.
[45:31.880 --> 45:33.860]  Oh, Bradley Beal of the...
[45:34.640 --> 45:35.040]  Basketball.
[45:35.060 --> 45:35.880]  Who does he play for?
[45:35.980 --> 45:36.800]  Phoenix Suns?
[45:36.820 --> 45:37.460]  Is that where he went?
[45:37.940 --> 45:39.500]  They don't have an NBA license.
[45:40.240 --> 45:40.820]  No, they do not.
[45:40.960 --> 45:41.620]  They do not have...
[45:41.620 --> 45:42.380]  They had to airbrush that off.
[45:42.480 --> 45:42.620]  You're right.
[45:42.980 --> 45:43.520]  Here we go.
[45:44.140 --> 45:45.500]  Rocky Mountain National Park.
[45:45.500 --> 45:46.300]  Inside the park.
[45:46.900 --> 45:48.920]  Man, I'm really bummed about that rookie.
[45:49.080 --> 45:51.520]  That's actually kind of a hit in the condition it's in.
[45:51.680 --> 45:52.920]  Do you want to save it out of it?
[45:53.240 --> 45:53.560]  No, no.
[45:54.820 --> 45:59.860]  1975 AL MVP and Rookie of the Year is Fred Lynn.
[46:00.680 --> 46:01.300]  There you go.
[46:01.640 --> 46:02.800]  Do you know anything about Fred Lynn?
[46:03.040 --> 46:03.840]  I don't, actually.
[46:03.960 --> 46:04.720]  Before my time.
[46:06.400 --> 46:10.580]  Unfortunately, how about we open up True Crime Anchorman.
[46:11.320 --> 46:12.760]  Let's see where we are with that.
[46:13.140 --> 46:14.940]  Emily, I'm going to lean on you for the true crime.
[46:14.940 --> 46:16.280]  Okay, I'm going to do my best.
[46:17.040 --> 46:18.740]  These are probably pretty old.
[46:19.060 --> 46:20.620]  I'm more versed in the...
[46:20.620 --> 46:21.980]  This is from 93, I think.
[46:22.180 --> 46:22.880]  Okay, well.
[46:23.960 --> 46:28.280]  I'm currently reading the book by the guy that they did that Mindhunter series about,
[46:28.500 --> 46:32.020]  who learned about profiling... or did the profiling of serial killers.
[46:33.320 --> 46:35.180]  Did they talk about Patrick McKay at all?
[46:36.360 --> 46:36.780]  I don't know.
[46:36.800 --> 46:38.240]  Did he kill some kids in England or something?
[46:39.060 --> 46:40.020]  They killed some kids in England.
[46:40.320 --> 46:40.660]  Are you serious?
[46:40.820 --> 46:41.220]  No.
[46:41.360 --> 46:41.720]  Well, maybe.
[46:41.720 --> 46:45.940]  Okay, at 13, at nearly 6 feet tall, he attacked and beat his mother and three sisters.
[46:46.200 --> 46:50.460]  At 15, had a police record for arson and violence and again attacked his mother.
[46:51.020 --> 46:53.640]  Psychiatrists labeled him a cold, psychopathic killer.
[46:54.500 --> 46:55.880]  1974, suspected.
[46:56.340 --> 46:58.700]  Now in London of six unsolved murders.
[46:58.800 --> 46:59.420]  You're pretty close.
[46:59.620 --> 47:00.000]  Close.
[47:00.200 --> 47:02.420]  1975, he confessed.
[47:02.620 --> 47:03.160]  That was the year I was born.
[47:04.000 --> 47:05.320]  Do you know Estelle Carey?
[47:05.900 --> 47:06.380]  No.
[47:08.160 --> 47:13.080]  She was the girlfriend of Nick Dean, Nick Sorella, and minded his interest in Chicago.
[47:13.320 --> 47:15.660]  She was a nightclub girl.
[47:15.840 --> 47:17.160]  She ran dice games.
[47:18.020 --> 47:19.100]  Lady of the Night.
[47:20.420 --> 47:22.620]  1952, she was associated with the mob.
[47:22.760 --> 47:23.040]  Okay.
[47:23.180 --> 47:23.980]  She probably killed some people.
[47:24.020 --> 47:25.760]  I recently read about the Purple Mob.
[47:25.980 --> 47:26.820]  The Purple Mob in Detroit.
[47:27.020 --> 47:28.520]  The old Detroit mobsters.
[47:29.000 --> 47:30.300]  Wanda Holloway, do you know her?
[47:30.600 --> 47:32.880]  No, I don't think I know any of these people.
[47:33.140 --> 47:36.180]  She probably killed somebody.
[47:36.840 --> 47:37.960]  Kenneth McDuff?
[47:38.120 --> 47:38.400]  No.
[47:38.560 --> 47:39.420]  Let's get there until we find somebody.
[47:39.580 --> 47:39.740]  Okay.
[47:40.440 --> 47:41.460]  Laurie Dan?
[47:41.840 --> 47:42.340]  No.
[47:43.780 --> 47:45.100]  Are you familiar with...
[47:45.100 --> 47:45.880]  The Babysitter.
[47:46.040 --> 47:49.260]  Oh, The Babysitter is in quotes, so...
[47:49.260 --> 47:56.940]  Between 1976 and 1977, seven pre-teens were killed in Oakland County, Michigan, a wealthy Detroit suburb.
[47:58.520 --> 48:01.380]  The first victim was a 16-year-old girl...
[48:02.960 --> 48:04.060]  It gets gruesome.
[48:04.200 --> 48:04.900]  Okay, yeah.
[48:04.900 --> 48:09.700]  Sometimes I don't like the glorifying of it.
[48:09.960 --> 48:10.100]  Oh!
[48:10.180 --> 48:11.360]  They're not glorifying it, but...
[48:11.360 --> 48:13.680]  Police have never discovered the identity of the killer.
[48:13.900 --> 48:16.120]  That's why he's hidden in quotations.
[48:16.440 --> 48:17.360]  Norris and Bitteker.
[48:18.100 --> 48:20.140]  Dude, that looks like Alan and Ginter's rivals.
[48:20.320 --> 48:21.320]  Larry Aylor?
[48:22.660 --> 48:25.200]  I don't know about him.
[48:26.860 --> 48:27.280]  I don't know.
[48:27.400 --> 48:28.580]  He was remarried three times.
[48:29.780 --> 48:30.260]  Common.
[48:32.320 --> 48:36.100]  He was sent to a Catholic home for emotionally disturbed children, dropped out of college.
[48:36.260 --> 48:37.160]  It's a lot of text.
[48:37.520 --> 48:38.840]  That is a...
[48:38.840 --> 48:39.040]  You get a novel.
[48:39.160 --> 48:40.500]  That's a lot. That's a lot to read.
[48:40.660 --> 48:41.260]  Joe Barbera.
[48:42.300 --> 48:43.460]  Is it Yogi's?
[48:43.540 --> 48:44.500]  Is it Yogi's brother?
[48:44.500 --> 48:45.520]  He killed Yogi.
[48:47.180 --> 48:47.980]  Joe Adonis.
[48:48.260 --> 48:49.380]  He looks like a killer.
[48:49.560 --> 48:50.280]  He does look like a killer.
[48:50.900 --> 48:51.700]  Samuel Rummel.
[48:52.140 --> 48:52.520]  Oof.
[48:52.960 --> 48:57.220]  And then, last but not least, probably, maybe least, Dan Turbo Gilbert.
[48:57.560 --> 48:58.840]  Dude, does he turbo kill people?
[49:00.820 --> 49:07.880]  Dan Turbo Gilbert, reputed to be the richest policeman in the world, testified to the Kefauver Committee in October 1950.
[49:08.320 --> 49:11.000]  He claimed he'd earned millions legally through deals.
[49:11.980 --> 49:12.860]  Oh, he's from Chicago.
[49:14.220 --> 49:15.260]  Turns out he didn't.
[49:15.800 --> 49:18.800]  Yeah, they seem like all just like old kind of gangster things.
[49:19.040 --> 49:19.580]  Old killers.
[49:20.120 --> 49:21.500]  You ever seen the movie Anchorman?
[49:22.000 --> 49:23.240]  Saw it too many times.
[49:24.460 --> 49:25.660]  Right after it came out.
[49:25.780 --> 49:28.160]  You know, it was like everybody had the DVD and they just watched it.
[49:28.160 --> 49:33.200]  You go over to someone's house, it's on, and then you don't ever watch it again for 10, 15 years.
[49:33.320 --> 49:34.600]  This thing was like 15 bucks.
[49:34.880 --> 49:35.600]  Let's hope it's worth it.
[49:35.900 --> 49:36.540]  Stay classy.
[49:37.440 --> 49:38.980]  Anchorman Ron Burgundy.
[49:39.460 --> 49:41.040]  San Diego's number one news anchor.
[49:41.420 --> 49:42.960]  There's Veronica Corningstone.
[49:43.840 --> 49:45.460]  Here's Brian Fantana.
[49:46.540 --> 49:48.260]  Here's Brick Tamland.
[49:48.660 --> 49:49.380]  He likes Lamp.
[49:49.840 --> 49:50.900]  Champ Kind.
[49:51.820 --> 49:53.180]  He does the weather, right?
[49:53.240 --> 49:54.200]  No, he does sports.
[49:54.400 --> 49:54.580]  Yeah.
[49:54.880 --> 49:55.760]  He's a sports guy.
[49:56.380 --> 49:57.840]  He says whammy!
[49:59.380 --> 50:00.400]  Ed Harkin.
[50:00.800 --> 50:02.420]  Oh, I like that actor.
[50:03.140 --> 50:03.500]  He's dead.
[50:05.300 --> 50:06.380]  Wes Mantooth.
[50:06.660 --> 50:08.040]  Vince Vaughn, that's good.
[50:08.220 --> 50:08.830]  Frank Vichard.
[50:11.510 --> 50:12.640]  This is probably my favorite character.
[50:12.640 --> 50:13.720]  Oh, is this the dueling?
[50:14.000 --> 50:14.940]  This is the other side.
[50:15.540 --> 50:17.120]  San Diego's number three news anchor.
[50:17.760 --> 50:19.200]  This is my favorite character in the whole movie.
[50:19.280 --> 50:21.260]  Tim Robbins as Chip McGee.
[50:22.380 --> 50:23.860]  Simply too good.
[50:24.140 --> 50:24.850]  Arturo Mendez.
[50:26.860 --> 50:27.580]  Steve Graff.
[50:28.100 --> 50:29.100]  Is that Ben Stiller?
[50:29.140 --> 50:29.740]  Yeah, that's Ben Stiller.
[50:29.840 --> 50:30.960]  I need to watch this movie again.
[50:30.980 --> 50:31.720]  Steve Graff.
[50:32.580 --> 50:34.400]  And then Jess Moondragon.
[50:34.580 --> 50:34.940]  That's cool.
[50:35.200 --> 50:35.760]  That is cool.
[50:35.900 --> 50:36.080]  Yeah.
[50:36.380 --> 50:38.140]  We can save some of those for...
[50:38.140 --> 50:38.900]  Oh, they're in numbered order.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.600]  I think maybe there's only 12 cards and we got all 12.
[50:40.820 --> 50:41.880]  Did we just complete the set?
[50:42.040 --> 50:42.180]  Dang.
[50:42.180 --> 50:43.380]  I'm glad I didn't buy more than one pack.
[50:44.600 --> 50:46.460]  Okay, we got about 10 minutes left.
[50:48.400 --> 50:48.760]  Let's...
[50:48.760 --> 50:50.360]  Let's open up a little bit of baseball.
[50:50.620 --> 50:51.660]  I bought this a while ago.
[50:51.740 --> 50:52.540]  It was Bowman baseball.
[50:53.920 --> 50:54.280]  2023?
[50:54.280 --> 50:55.080]  2023.
[50:55.680 --> 50:57.540]  And then after this, we'll...
[50:57.540 --> 50:59.600]  We'll fuck around with old...
[50:59.600 --> 51:00.860]  Old sloppy goes.
[51:01.280 --> 51:03.480]  I am so stoked about this.
[51:03.560 --> 51:03.980]  I am too.
[51:04.260 --> 51:06.880]  As co-creator of the game, I'm excited about this.
[51:09.020 --> 51:10.440]  You are co-creator of the game.
[51:10.760 --> 51:12.060]  Yeah, I was there every night.
[51:12.180 --> 51:13.480]  It's on my TV constantly.
[51:14.020 --> 51:15.860]  Behind these monitors, it's on the TV.
[51:16.040 --> 51:18.360]  Babe, also, I'll go so far as to say you might be like...
[51:18.360 --> 51:21.040]  You might be like 60-40 creator on that one.
[51:21.680 --> 51:21.960]  I'm not.
[51:22.220 --> 51:23.280]  What's fun is that even...
[51:23.800 --> 51:24.240]  Feedback.
[51:25.300 --> 51:26.040]  I'm just excited.
[51:26.180 --> 51:27.540]  I just love Sloppy Joe's.
[51:27.620 --> 51:28.920]  I love everything about it.
[51:29.000 --> 51:33.000]  And it's been such a delight as a new member of our family.
[51:33.480 --> 51:34.380]  It really does feel like...
[51:34.380 --> 51:36.140]  We saw Fist Fight on Saturday night.
[51:36.260 --> 51:38.080]  We saw a guy without...
[51:38.080 --> 51:39.960]  It was so many things in one.
[51:40.160 --> 51:41.420]  It was shirtless.
[51:41.780 --> 51:43.320]  There may not have been shoes on.
[51:43.820 --> 51:44.640]  There was a fight.
[51:44.840 --> 51:45.500]  Dead Parrot Head.
[51:45.860 --> 51:47.280]  Dead Parrot Head involved.
[51:47.720 --> 51:50.600]  But it was in the back corner, so it was hard to film it.
[51:50.600 --> 51:53.720]  But you just see a guy flail into the street.
[51:53.960 --> 51:54.620]  Throwing haymakers.
[51:54.740 --> 51:55.960]  Almost got hit by a car.
[51:56.080 --> 51:56.500]  That's a bingo.
[51:56.580 --> 51:58.420]  You could have got a bingo on that fight alone.
[51:58.460 --> 51:58.980]  You could have, yeah.
[51:59.360 --> 52:00.360]  Brandon Crawford.
[52:01.540 --> 52:02.220]  Ah, Freddie Freeman.
[52:02.560 --> 52:03.740]  Having a hell of a year, Freddie Freeman.
[52:04.220 --> 52:06.200]  Riley Green, paper rookie.
[52:06.380 --> 52:07.020]  Put that over there.
[52:07.620 --> 52:08.560]  Jose Ramirez.
[52:09.260 --> 52:10.120]  Joey Votto.
[52:11.620 --> 52:12.500]  Matt Olson.
[52:12.660 --> 52:12.940]  Ooh.
[52:14.100 --> 52:14.740]  What'd you say?
[52:15.680 --> 52:16.560]  Vaughn Grisham.
[52:16.760 --> 52:17.640]  Rookie of the year.
[52:17.660 --> 52:18.080]  That's a pretty card.
[52:18.300 --> 52:19.020]  Yeah, chrome.
[52:19.020 --> 52:19.640]  That's nice.
[52:20.640 --> 52:21.760]  Geofferson Rojas.
[52:21.840 --> 52:23.140]  Martin Gonzalez.
[52:23.660 --> 52:24.380]  Bowman first.
[52:24.680 --> 52:25.380]  Sleep that.
[52:25.600 --> 52:26.680]  Jet Williams.
[52:26.840 --> 52:28.340]  Eric Brown Jr. chrome.
[52:28.680 --> 52:31.400]  And Marco Luciano chrome.
[52:32.100 --> 52:33.080]  Moving along.
[52:34.820 --> 52:37.020]  For people that don't remember what Dead Parrot Head means...
[52:38.680 --> 52:40.160]  How would you describe it?
[52:40.360 --> 52:45.020]  It's the person who cashed in their life savings to live that Parrot Head lifestyle in Key West.
[52:45.520 --> 52:48.120]  Followed their fearless leader, Jimmy Buffett, down there.
[52:48.120 --> 52:51.480]  And then ran out of money and didn't have a way to get back home or desire.
[52:51.660 --> 52:54.980]  So they just slowly drink themselves into a staph infection.
[52:55.340 --> 52:56.460]  And then they die.
[52:57.180 --> 52:59.780]  And they shuffle around like zombies for a few years first.
[53:00.460 --> 53:01.160]  Salvador Perez.
[53:02.200 --> 53:03.720]  Ezekiel Tovar, paper rookie.
[53:03.900 --> 53:04.680]  Put that, Hunter.
[53:04.800 --> 53:05.240]  Green.
[53:06.320 --> 53:08.060]  D.L. Doolhall.
[53:08.760 --> 53:09.240]  Doolhall.
[53:10.000 --> 53:10.400]  Paper rookie.
[53:11.400 --> 53:12.660]  Shohei Otani base.
[53:12.760 --> 53:13.560]  Always sleeves Shohei.
[53:14.080 --> 53:14.740]  Pete Alonzo.
[53:14.880 --> 53:16.300]  Man, sucks to be an Angels fan.
[53:16.300 --> 53:18.260]  I mean, for many, many years.
[53:18.600 --> 53:19.420]  But, goddamn.
[53:19.900 --> 53:23.280]  Y'all have the greatest player of the last few generations in Mike Trout.
[53:23.620 --> 53:26.720]  And the greatest player of the next few generations in Shohei Otani.
[53:26.820 --> 53:28.460]  And you're going to lose them both in the offseason this year.
[53:28.580 --> 53:29.920]  Why? What do you mean? Where are they going to go?
[53:29.940 --> 53:32.300]  Well, Mike Trout's got to go because he's fucking...
[53:32.840 --> 53:37.540]  He's never come within ten games of making the playoffs in his entire fucking career playing for the Angels.
[53:37.880 --> 53:41.620]  So I think he's eventually... he's just got to go to get... have an opportunity to compete.
[53:41.720 --> 53:43.260]  He's one of the greatest baseball players of all time.
[53:43.300 --> 53:44.340]  Is he hurt right now?
[53:44.420 --> 53:45.260]  Because we didn't see him play.
[53:45.260 --> 53:48.040]  Mike Trout has been shut down for the season. For the rest of the season, I think.
[53:48.440 --> 53:50.000]  Shohei is out for the rest of season, too.
[53:50.340 --> 53:53.240]  He's a free agent at the end of the year. He's leaving. He's gone.
[53:53.340 --> 53:53.720]  Wow, okay.
[53:53.720 --> 53:56.600]  They were going to deal him at the trade deadline.
[53:56.940 --> 53:59.480]  And they decided to make a play for the playoffs instead.
[54:00.020 --> 54:03.060]  And like a week later, they found out he needs Tommy John surgery.
[54:03.300 --> 54:05.140]  Which is like a year.
[54:05.780 --> 54:08.060]  And then he was still batting for a while.
[54:08.180 --> 54:10.080]  But now they just shut him down. He already cleaned out his locker.
[54:10.240 --> 54:10.780]  Like, he's gone.
[54:11.140 --> 54:11.460]  What?
[54:11.700 --> 54:13.160]  He emptied his lockers. Cleaned out.
[54:13.160 --> 54:15.780]  Are there any rumors about where they might be going?
[54:16.140 --> 54:16.740]  Either one of them?
[54:17.080 --> 54:19.100]  Shohei wants to be on the West Coast, so he can be close to Japan.
[54:19.280 --> 54:21.020]  So a lot of people have said, like, San Francisco, maybe.
[54:21.840 --> 54:22.400]  What about San Diego?
[54:23.320 --> 54:24.420]  Nobody wants him to go there.
[54:25.580 --> 54:29.020]  Sal Frelick. Bowman is number 33 out of the top 100.
[54:30.360 --> 54:31.060]  Just leave that.
[54:33.340 --> 54:35.620]  Fraley, Incarnacion, first paper.
[54:37.500 --> 54:38.300]  Moises Ballestros.
[54:38.980 --> 54:40.280]  Oh, here we go.
[54:40.280 --> 54:44.160]  Luis Garcia, 199 of 199.
[54:44.560 --> 54:47.260]  Bowman first, purple, whatever.
[54:47.480 --> 54:51.500]  I'm not super familiar with Bowman's refractors.
[54:52.060 --> 54:54.380]  But that is cool. That's also a damaged card.
[54:55.100 --> 54:55.840]  God damn, man.
[54:56.100 --> 54:56.900]  Every good card we get.
[54:57.800 --> 55:01.480]  Davidson de los Santos, Berman first chrome, and then...
[55:01.480 --> 55:02.220]  He's like, shh.
[55:02.480 --> 55:05.000]  Do we get two numbered cards in the same pack?
[55:05.180 --> 55:05.600]  Look at this.
[55:05.880 --> 55:08.640]  Carlos George, 129 of 150.
[55:08.640 --> 55:09.900]  That looks like a blue.
[55:10.140 --> 55:11.760]  In Panini, this would be called a blue shimmer.
[55:12.060 --> 55:14.720]  I assume that they call it the same thing in tops.
[55:14.820 --> 55:16.220]  But that's a fucking gorgeous card.
[55:16.320 --> 55:18.280]  Wow, that's a hell of a pack.
[55:19.120 --> 55:19.900]  Okay, you know what?
[55:19.940 --> 55:21.820]  Let's open one more, and then...
[55:21.820 --> 55:23.660]  Actually, we'll...
[55:23.660 --> 55:25.840]  We gotta get on to the Sloppy Joe bingo set.
[55:27.400 --> 55:28.900]  Wanna give it the time it deserves.
[55:29.020 --> 55:30.040]  Last pack of the day.
[55:30.200 --> 55:31.000]  Last pack mojo.
[55:31.660 --> 55:32.840]  Alec Burleson, paper rookie.
[55:33.100 --> 55:34.680]  Gunnar Henderson, paper rookie.
[55:35.580 --> 55:36.980]  Brian Bellow, paper rookie.
[55:36.980 --> 55:38.960]  Mark Vientos, paper rookie.
[55:39.160 --> 55:41.380]  Trey Turner, Wilson Contreras.
[55:41.700 --> 55:44.980]  Andrew Painter, Bowman Scouts, number 18 out of 100.
[55:45.740 --> 55:47.860]  Eduardo Julien, Bowman First.
[55:48.740 --> 55:51.340]  Jankeel Fernandez, Brooks Lee.
[55:51.740 --> 55:52.920]  Khalil Watson, Chrome.
[55:53.200 --> 55:56.180]  And Junior Garcia, Chrome First.
[55:56.540 --> 55:56.720]  Cool.
[55:57.400 --> 55:57.860]  All right.
[55:59.840 --> 56:00.480]  Now...
[56:00.980 --> 56:02.780]  Let's get to the real star of the show.
[56:03.520 --> 56:04.160]  This...
[56:04.160 --> 56:06.540]  Okay, so you're releasing this when you guys do the live
[56:06.540 --> 56:07.340]  Sloppy Joe bingo.
[56:07.340 --> 56:08.880]  Yeah, so next Friday night...
[56:08.880 --> 56:10.460]  Eric will have all the important dates and stuff.
[56:10.680 --> 56:12.120]  Is it this coming Friday or next Friday?
[56:12.120 --> 56:13.400]  No, next week.
[56:13.440 --> 56:14.440]  I think the 29th?
[56:14.460 --> 56:14.860]  Yes.
[56:15.660 --> 56:17.460]  Like 9 or 10 or...
[56:17.460 --> 56:18.360]  Sometime in the PM.
[56:18.720 --> 56:18.900]  Yeah.
[56:19.260 --> 56:23.120]  We're gonna do Sloppy Joe's bingo live for an hour, hour and a half, however long we do it.
[56:23.340 --> 56:25.100]  It'll be the second time we've done it live for y'all.
[56:25.400 --> 56:26.420]  Or maybe the third now.
[56:28.240 --> 56:31.620]  And during that period, this will go on sale and you can buy it.
[56:32.320 --> 56:34.540]  Sloppy Joe's bingo...
[56:34.540 --> 56:36.120]  Sloppy Joe's bingo play-at-home kit.
[56:36.380 --> 56:38.060]  It's Slop-O-Clock somewhere.
[56:38.160 --> 56:40.380]  And then right here, another Unifarm experience.
[56:40.480 --> 56:42.240]  Unifarm, combined with Power One, with the fabric of the farm.
[56:42.780 --> 56:43.000]  Uniform.
[56:43.180 --> 56:47.380]  And so you guys ordered a decent amount, but enough that...
[56:47.380 --> 56:48.800]  Okay, I can talk about that.
[56:48.800 --> 56:50.000]  I was a little anxious about that.
[56:50.360 --> 56:51.360]  For people that want to know...
[56:51.360 --> 56:53.640]  Also, if you didn't know, you missed it.
[56:53.700 --> 56:54.900]  We had a Gerpler restock.
[56:55.460 --> 56:56.580]  I think it went really well.
[56:57.300 --> 56:58.820]  It seemed that most people got it.
[56:58.860 --> 57:01.100]  It was live for a couple of hours before we went out of stock.
[57:01.160 --> 57:02.380]  We sold 2,000.
[57:02.380 --> 57:04.960]  So we were able to sell 2,000 Gerplers in that time.
[57:05.820 --> 57:07.020]  This is a little different.
[57:07.240 --> 57:08.240]  A little bit more expensive.
[57:08.360 --> 57:09.180]  I don't know how much it costs.
[57:09.580 --> 57:11.340]  But it's a little bit more of a premium product.
[57:11.420 --> 57:13.420]  So I think we made 1,000 of these.
[57:14.100 --> 57:16.480]  So hopefully you'll have time...
[57:16.480 --> 57:18.380]  1,000 of anything is a lot to sell.
[57:18.740 --> 57:21.700]  So hopefully you'll have time to pick this up.
[57:21.980 --> 57:24.840]  Oh, now he heard we were giving information wrong.
[57:25.200 --> 57:26.940]  What time next Friday night does this go on sale?
[57:27.620 --> 57:29.160]  We will be live!
[57:29.300 --> 57:30.620]  I hope my microphone's on now.
[57:32.380 --> 57:38.260]  We will be live Friday night at 10 p.m. Central Time.
[57:38.340 --> 57:40.080]  I'm crazy!
[57:40.620 --> 57:42.340]  At 10, 10 p.m.
[57:42.700 --> 57:43.940]  This will go on sale.
[57:44.320 --> 57:47.640]  And you can play Slop O'Clock along with us.
[57:47.720 --> 57:49.700]  Or at home by yourself.
[57:49.700 --> 57:50.940]  Or with friends or loved ones.
[57:51.180 --> 57:52.760]  It's simply too good.
[57:53.000 --> 57:53.400]  That's right.
[57:53.460 --> 57:53.920]  There you go.
[57:54.000 --> 57:55.140]  Now let's check out what's in here.
[57:56.160 --> 57:58.320]  It's Slop O'Clock somewhere.
[57:59.140 --> 58:00.900]  Sloppy Drews from Canada.
[58:01.020 --> 58:01.780]  That's so cool.
[58:02.820 --> 58:04.240]  I'm like, I'd die.
[58:04.380 --> 58:06.280]  This is the first time that they are seeing this.
[58:07.360 --> 58:10.520]  The detail on everything is insane.
[58:10.760 --> 58:12.120]  So we have this t-shirt.
[58:12.720 --> 58:14.020]  It's the Sloppy Drews shirt.
[58:14.100 --> 58:15.160]  Oh, it's a medium. That's my size.
[58:16.800 --> 58:18.300]  That's what it's for. This is yours.
[58:20.060 --> 58:22.620]  The box itself, that's a good box.
[58:22.700 --> 58:24.620]  You could keep this box with all your other items.
[58:24.740 --> 58:25.460]  You keep your most precious items.
[58:26.040 --> 58:26.680]  All your treasures.
[58:27.080 --> 58:28.700]  So you get the Slop O'Clock t-shirt.
[58:29.000 --> 58:30.040]  Put it back down.
[58:30.040 --> 58:30.780]  There you go.
[58:32.580 --> 58:33.680]  Sloppy Drews, Canada.
[58:34.320 --> 58:36.360]  We've gotten more mileage out of this fucking photo.
[58:36.880 --> 58:37.460]  I love it.
[58:37.620 --> 58:38.920]  Alright, we've got that.
[58:39.000 --> 58:40.120]  It's the only photo.
[58:40.600 --> 58:40.800]  I know.
[58:42.300 --> 58:43.420]  I don't even know what's in it.
[58:43.440 --> 58:43.960]  What are these?
[58:44.720 --> 58:45.560]  I don't even know.
[58:45.780 --> 58:49.460]  You guys are getting a real look the first time they are seeing this.
[58:49.700 --> 58:51.080]  They have no idea what's in this thing.
[58:51.660 --> 58:52.360]  Are these the cards?
[58:53.140 --> 58:54.140]  Yeah, do you want to pull those out?
[58:54.180 --> 58:55.780]  Oh my gosh.
[58:56.520 --> 58:57.780]  Are they reusable?
[58:58.980 --> 58:59.720]  Check them out.
[58:59.720 --> 59:02.560]  Oh my God.
[59:03.360 --> 59:07.960]  These are the official Sloppy Joe's bingo cards.
[59:08.120 --> 59:09.560]  You can play Sloppy Bingo with us.
[59:09.880 --> 59:12.660]  You have the fuckface space for free in the middle.
[59:12.900 --> 59:15.780]  And then it's all randomized stuff.
[59:16.000 --> 59:20.760]  So what we're going to do when we do this live,
[59:21.180 --> 59:27.180]  we're all going to have a different card that is an actual card from Sloppy Joe's bingo set.
[59:27.320 --> 59:28.260]  There's so many.
[59:28.260 --> 59:29.240]  All your favorites.
[59:29.560 --> 59:30.000]  Chug.
[59:30.180 --> 59:31.180]  Offensive t-shirt.
[59:31.460 --> 59:32.480]  Kid out too late.
[59:32.900 --> 59:34.360]  Sucking on a chili dog.
[59:35.160 --> 59:35.840]  Cop car.
[59:35.980 --> 59:36.400]  Ambulance.
[59:36.480 --> 59:37.020]  Fire truck.
[59:37.180 --> 59:37.880]  Formal attire.
[59:38.300 --> 59:38.740]  Mullet.
[59:38.960 --> 59:40.000]  Guy on guy's scooter.
[59:40.140 --> 59:43.760]  But Geoff, how am I supposed to keep track of what I have on my card?
[59:43.820 --> 59:46.400]  Oh, well you would probably have to use some kind of a pen or a pencil.
[59:47.320 --> 59:50.520]  Maybe you could do a Sloppy Joe bingo dauber.
[59:50.900 --> 59:51.940]  What the fuck?
[59:52.080 --> 59:53.120]  Let's see it in action.
[59:53.500 --> 59:54.420]  Oh baby.
[59:54.540 --> 59:55.200]  I mean it's going to take a while.
[59:55.380 --> 59:57.460]  You should daub it up on some paper.
[59:57.460 --> 59:57.920]  Maybe on the back?
[59:57.920 --> 59:58.880]  Yeah, I'll daub it on some paper.
[59:59.200 --> 59:59.420]  Oh, on the paper?
[59:59.800 --> 59:59.960]  Yeah.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.880]  Wait, what is the base of the dauber?
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.600]  Oh, you're going to see.
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.520]  I'm so excited.
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.880]  There's so many in here.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:07.180]  Yes.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.180]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.460]  You could have an entire...
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:10.900]  Oh yeah, I'll take that plate.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.200]  Thank you.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.180]  You could have a big party.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:12.820]  You gotta walk it in.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:13.460]  Awesome.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.240]  Appreciate it.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:14.840]  Wow.
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:15.360]  Here we go.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.180]  Let's see what this looks like.
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.160]  It's going to take a while.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:17.880]  It's going to take a while.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.080]  You're going to have to put some work into it.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.260]  Oh, it's coming.
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.020]  Keep going.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:21.600]  Keep going.
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:22.480]  There you go.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:23.380]  Almost there.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:23.680]  Oh.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.860]  Now, it is the asterisk from the...
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:30.160]  It'll get there.
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.040]  ...face show.
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.520]  It just has to fill.
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:33.500]  But here's the thing.
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:35.200]  It's not just blue.
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:39.620]  We also have the official red and yellow.
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:40.680]  There you go.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:46.080]  They will all come with this set so you can play with friends at home.
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.120]  There's here...
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.040]  There's a Sloppy Joe stream back there and there's a luxury car.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.160]  Oh, wow.
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:52.960]  Well, I don't want to do it.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:53.680]  You don't want to do it?
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.100]  I'll do it.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.820]  This is the one to play with.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.840]  It's dabbed.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:58.440]  It's dabbed.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.320]  It's dabbed.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:00:59.720]  It's dabbed.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.720]  It's dabbed and dabbed.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:05.960]  So, this is on sale the 29th.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.040]  Is that the date?
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:07.540]  Yeah.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:08.500]  Friday the 29th.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.280]  Friday the 29th.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.180]  10 p.m.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.380]  We will be live.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.900]  10, 10 p.m.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.720]  We will put these on sale.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.320]  10, 15.
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.760]  Official Sloppy Clock.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:22.240]  That's when we begin and we'll play our game of Sloppy Joe.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.420]  That sounds great.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.180]  So, you get the box.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:26.100]  You get the shirt.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.060]  You get the cards.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.480]  You get the three daubers with the fuck face stars.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.100]  And a good box.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.700]  And you get the precious memories box to put all of your most important items.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:36.300]  All your treasures.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.140]  All your treasures.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:37.400]  Yep.
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:38.300]  There you go.
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.540]  It's Sloppy Clock somewhere.
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:40.480]  It says it right here.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.000]  One sloppy t-shirt, three asterisk daubers and 25 sloppy t-shirts.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.080]  We will have that on sale along with, I think, the clock from Sloppy Clock.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:48.780]  Yeah.
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:49.680]  Do we have...
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.140]  I guess it's too late to show that off.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:58.120]  I think the rollout mat that we have, the VCK boot mouse mat, will also be on sale at that time.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:58.400]  Oh, wow.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.560]  We need one of those at our house.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.400]  You have one here that you can take.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:01.860]  Let's go.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:02.720]  There you go.
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:03.360]  We did it!
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.280]  And I was here for the whole thing.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.640]  I definitely didn't just get done with an episode recording and then run right over here.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:11.220]  Yay!
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:14.680]  Thank you so much for tuning in to another episode of The Break Show.
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:18.260]  Also, thank you for indulging my little speech at the beginning.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.020]  It was a good speech.
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:22.640]  It's not very often I get to talk directly to you in a live format.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.620]  Not as often as it used to be.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.800]  And so, I wanted to take the opportunity to do that.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.000]  Love you all.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.120]  Everybody, get excited about and support Dog Bark.
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:37.540]  In addition to Face Jam and Fuck Face and Anma and Inside Gaming and So All Right.

[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:49.040]  No shit.

[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.940]  Fuckfacepod.com slash first.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.180]  Oh, and listen in to Fuckface.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.620]  I already said it, but listen in to Fuckface this week and especially next week.
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:03.340]  Because yes, we are announcing some new content.
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:04.520]  Bye!
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.220]  Bye!
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.060]  We didn't even do Dallas.
