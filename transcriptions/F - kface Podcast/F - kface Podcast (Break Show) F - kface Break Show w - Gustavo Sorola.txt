[00:11.100 --> 00:15.440]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Face Break Show.
[00:15.940 --> 00:21.060]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, the lovely and adorable Emily Hatfield.
[00:21.920 --> 00:26.720]  There you go. And filling in for Eric this week, my very special guest.
[00:27.080 --> 00:31.820]  Our very special guest. Co-founder of the company we both inhabit.
[00:32.980 --> 00:35.480]  Gustavo Raul Sorolla III.
[00:36.720 --> 00:36.940]  That's me.
[00:37.580 --> 00:37.880]  Yes.
[00:38.060 --> 00:39.400]  That's me. That's my full name.
[00:39.400 --> 00:40.960]  That is your full Pussy Slay name.
[00:41.920 --> 00:44.560]  That has got to be my least favorite sound drop.
[00:44.600 --> 00:45.040]  Pussy Slay?
[00:45.200 --> 00:46.180]  You saying that.
[00:46.480 --> 00:46.720]  Pussy Slay.
[00:46.800 --> 00:47.660]  Was that something with Blizz?
[00:47.820 --> 00:48.860]  Yeah, Blizz had me say it.
[00:49.340 --> 00:50.760]  How did you figure that out?
[00:52.620 --> 00:55.040]  You know, I'm smart. I got brains.
[00:55.580 --> 00:57.200]  So Gus, this is the Break Show.
[00:57.560 --> 01:00.180]  We've been talking about having you on for a really long time.
[01:00.260 --> 01:03.280]  When I first pitched this, I think maybe I was on the RT podcast with you.
[01:04.200 --> 01:07.300]  I've been doing this sporadically for a little over two years.
[01:07.480 --> 01:08.740]  Now we finally got a slot.
[01:08.740 --> 01:12.980]  All we had to do was stop making the RT podcast live on Mondays so that I could take the slot.
[01:13.660 --> 01:14.640]  Congratulations. You're welcome.
[01:14.820 --> 01:15.440]  Thank you, by the way.
[01:15.540 --> 01:18.380]  But I was like, 5 o'clock? That's for suckers. We're going to roll it back an hour.
[01:18.940 --> 01:19.840]  Which you could have done.
[01:19.860 --> 01:21.440]  It's like daylight savings all the time.
[01:21.860 --> 01:22.080]  Yeah.
[01:22.820 --> 01:29.380]  And you mentioned to me that at some point in your childhood, you went into a Walmart and they were liquidating all of their baseball cards.
[01:30.000 --> 01:31.280]  Actually, they weren't even liquidating.
[01:31.340 --> 01:32.520]  I think they were going to throw it all away.
[01:32.900 --> 01:38.560]  They had all of the previous year's baseball cards in those metal shopping carts out by the customer service desk.
[01:39.080 --> 01:41.580]  And I walked in the customer service desk right by the front door.
[01:41.640 --> 01:42.600]  And I must have been like 12.
[01:42.840 --> 01:43.020]  Yeah.
[01:43.300 --> 01:45.260]  And I was like, hey, I collected baseball cards at the time.
[01:45.300 --> 01:46.500]  I was like, hey, what are you all doing with that?
[01:46.780 --> 01:48.340]  They were like, I don't know, we're getting rid of them.
[01:48.440 --> 01:49.940]  I was like, I'll buy all of them.
[01:50.720 --> 01:52.100]  And they were like, okay, how much do you have?
[01:52.340 --> 01:55.680]  And I had a part-time job. I had like 100, 200 bucks.
[01:55.760 --> 01:57.620]  I was like, I'll give you like 100 bucks for all of them.
[01:57.700 --> 01:58.140]  They were like, okay.
[01:58.140 --> 02:02.540]  And so I bought like all their excess stock.
[02:02.940 --> 02:07.940]  So what you have in that giant suitcase comprises less than half of what you bought.
[02:08.060 --> 02:08.320]  Yeah.
[02:08.500 --> 02:10.600]  This is what your mom brought up for you.
[02:10.760 --> 02:12.600]  My return on investment is going to be through the roof.
[02:13.140 --> 02:17.300]  $100 I invested in 1990 is going to pay off big time here.
[02:17.440 --> 02:27.400]  It's wild to think that you can walk into a Walmart in 1990 and buy 40 or 50,000 baseball cards for 100 bucks and have that be a bad decision.
[02:28.040 --> 02:28.920]  30 years later.
[02:29.060 --> 02:32.000]  When I was 12, it was the best idea in the world.
[02:32.200 --> 02:37.120]  There is little to no value in that box, but we're going to go through all of it if we can.
[02:37.640 --> 02:38.180]  It's a lot.
[02:38.340 --> 02:38.700]  It's a lot.
[02:38.860 --> 02:41.580]  So this is going to be a bit of a different episode because we're just going to be going through your stuff.
[02:41.700 --> 02:43.860]  I do want to do a couple of things.
[02:44.560 --> 02:47.040]  Last episode was our first official in the weekly series.
[02:47.140 --> 02:48.280]  And so we opened some stuff.
[02:48.740 --> 02:51.560]  I saw a lot of people talking about some of the cards we opened up and their value.
[02:51.700 --> 02:56.400]  So I wanted to revisit that and show you the three cards that had any kind of value that we opened.
[02:56.400 --> 03:01.020]  This, Magic the Gathering, which meant fucking nothing to me when we pulled it.
[03:01.120 --> 03:02.660]  This is a Delighted Halfling card.
[03:03.580 --> 03:04.500]  About 10 bucks.
[03:05.340 --> 03:09.060]  So it's a bit of a chase card for this run of Magic.
[03:09.060 --> 03:10.540]  This shows pain for itself.
[03:10.760 --> 03:10.900]  Yeah.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.240]  So that was about 10 bucks.
[03:13.440 --> 03:14.260]  What are his abilities?
[03:14.940 --> 03:18.600]  He's a Delighted Halfling, so he probably drinks a lot and is ambitious.
[03:19.380 --> 03:22.140]  Spend this mana only to cast a legendary spell. That spell cannot be countered.
[03:22.460 --> 03:22.880]  Is that good?
[03:23.080 --> 03:24.260]  I don't know. I haven't played Magic in years.
[03:25.220 --> 03:25.940]  You know.
[03:26.080 --> 03:27.160]  You know more.
[03:27.480 --> 03:29.280]  This one, which I pulled, this is Sean Dunstan.
[03:29.440 --> 03:31.460]  This is actually 85 tops, I believe.
[03:31.640 --> 03:32.380]  I remember Sean Dunstan.
[03:32.620 --> 03:37.640]  Yeah, and this is like his old... I don't know why he was an 82 draft pick.
[03:37.680 --> 03:39.280]  So I don't know if this is considered his rookie or not.
[03:39.620 --> 03:42.000]  But this one goes for about six dollars.
[03:42.960 --> 03:43.320]  However...
[03:43.320 --> 03:45.160]  We should see if I have that card in here.
[03:45.160 --> 03:46.560]  We might. You might have it in there.
[03:46.840 --> 03:46.900]  Yeah.
[03:47.180 --> 03:48.640]  So this Sean Dunstan goes for about six bucks.
[03:48.720 --> 03:50.700]  It is horribly miscut, so it would go for nothing.
[03:50.800 --> 03:51.120]  Oh, yeah.
[03:51.160 --> 03:53.400]  And then a lot of people were talking about Trophy Trey.
[03:53.400 --> 03:56.740]  They were saying, Geoff, that's a chase card from...
[03:56.740 --> 04:01.820]  I guess Trey is the very first garbage pill kid of all time.
[04:01.960 --> 04:02.120]  Really?
[04:02.460 --> 04:04.140]  And so this is a bit of a chase card.
[04:04.240 --> 04:04.640]  I looked it up.
[04:04.720 --> 04:08.380]  PSA 10 will run you about 25 dollars for this card.
[04:08.680 --> 04:11.760]  Now, this card could never be a PSA 10 because it's so miscut.
[04:11.860 --> 04:12.720]  You can see...
[04:12.720 --> 04:13.380]  The mirror on it's nice.
[04:13.380 --> 04:16.760]  If it's more than 60-40 off, it can't get a perfect score.
[04:17.060 --> 04:17.860]  That's like 80-20 maybe?
[04:17.880 --> 04:18.580]  Yeah, it's brutal.
[04:18.580 --> 04:22.900]  So even if you got this submitted to PSA...
[04:22.900 --> 04:25.860]  Which, by the way, they say if it's a PSA 10, it's worth 25 bucks, right?
[04:25.920 --> 04:30.460]  The cheapest submission you can do to get a PSA rating is 15 dollars.
[04:30.680 --> 04:32.040]  And that's like bulk submission.
[04:32.580 --> 04:38.760]  So it's like, yeah, it's worth the cost of getting graded plus a dollar.
[04:38.840 --> 04:41.280]  The doctor told me after I turned 40 I need to keep an eye on my PSA.
[04:41.700 --> 04:42.560]  Do you? How's it doing?
[04:42.660 --> 04:43.580]  It's doing all right. It's good.
[04:44.180 --> 04:46.120]  A little prostate humor for our over 40 crowd.
[04:46.560 --> 04:47.640]  I was like, I don't know that one.
[04:48.100 --> 04:50.020]  Do you get up to pee a thousand times in the night?
[04:50.060 --> 04:50.800]  I do not. I'm still good.
[04:51.000 --> 04:51.640]  Dude, that's me, man.
[04:52.160 --> 04:55.340]  That way you know you can put him in here and then you know that you're looking for him.
[04:55.500 --> 04:56.720]  I'm a triple in my history.
[04:56.720 --> 04:57.200]  That's a good idea.
[04:57.340 --> 04:58.080]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[04:58.100 --> 04:58.660]  That's what I'm here for.
[04:59.060 --> 05:00.900]  So I thought it'd be fun to open up all your stuff.
[05:01.000 --> 05:08.940]  And obviously we, the center of the collecting world, everybody knows that a regulation card collection begins and ends with Don Zimmer.
[05:09.180 --> 05:09.580]  Of course.
[05:09.820 --> 05:12.820]  You gotta have your Don Zimmer. It is the basis for all collecting.
[05:12.820 --> 05:15.820]  I assume like in Magic the Gathering, there's that card, right?
[05:15.920 --> 05:17.880]  You have that base card that everybody wants.
[05:18.160 --> 05:18.720]  It's like the standard.
[05:18.960 --> 05:19.920]  Is it like a Lotus or something?
[05:20.280 --> 05:21.820]  That's like a super rare one.
[05:22.040 --> 05:23.680]  That's like pulling an auto-Zimmer.
[05:26.220 --> 05:30.980]  But hilariously, I was looking through your suitcase a little bit earlier and Don Zimmer was all over the 80s.
[05:31.060 --> 05:32.500]  He was in all kinds of sets.
[05:32.820 --> 05:39.040]  I think you somehow threaded the needle to only buying boxes of cards that don't include Don Zimmer.
[05:39.180 --> 05:39.940]  I was the anti-Zimmer.
[05:40.120 --> 05:40.920]  Yeah, you were the anti-Zimmer.
[05:41.000 --> 05:41.920]  So we'll figure that out.
[05:41.920 --> 05:43.140]  He's more of a Pedro Martinez.
[05:43.680 --> 05:45.380]  Oh yeah, we're in honor, you know.
[05:46.060 --> 05:50.620]  I wanted to give you a little taste of what the normal show's like though, so we're gonna do a little mini-opening.
[05:50.820 --> 05:52.360]  So we're gonna open some of my favorite cards.
[05:52.540 --> 05:53.220]  Just real fast.
[05:53.380 --> 05:53.980]  And then we'll get into yours.
[05:54.320 --> 05:57.340]  This is first, Gilded Age Americana cards, Gus.
[05:57.380 --> 05:58.480]  You're gonna love these.
[05:58.760 --> 05:59.720]  These are fantastic.
[06:00.040 --> 06:02.140]  Maybe we can pull another original Kathy Bates.
[06:02.520 --> 06:04.120]  She'll blow your mind when you see her.
[06:04.920 --> 06:05.840]  What do we get here?
[06:05.960 --> 06:09.000]  Oh, this is from the first football game.
[06:09.400 --> 06:11.600]  They were on the R's, the fighting R's.
[06:12.900 --> 06:14.940]  Like the first football game?
[06:15.080 --> 06:15.520]  That's what it says.
[06:16.240 --> 06:17.200]  Rutgers or something?
[06:17.700 --> 06:18.020]  All right.
[06:18.500 --> 06:18.940]  Rutgers...
[06:20.980 --> 06:22.580]  That's not what I thought the R stood for.
[06:22.880 --> 06:28.820]  Okay, Rutgers University and Princeton faced off in the first game of intercollegiate football on November 6th, 1869.
[06:29.020 --> 06:30.540]  Anybody care to guess who won?
[06:30.980 --> 06:31.400]  Rutgers.
[06:31.600 --> 06:32.220]  Rutgers, yeah.
[06:32.280 --> 06:33.080]  They won six to four.
[06:33.680 --> 06:34.660]  Ooh, high scoring game.
[06:34.800 --> 06:35.400]  That was a shootout.
[06:35.500 --> 06:36.820]  Two safeties in that game.
[06:38.560 --> 06:39.820]  Yosemite National Park.
[06:40.000 --> 06:40.660]  Never been there.
[06:40.660 --> 06:41.740]  You have, I think.
[06:42.220 --> 06:44.160]  No, if I did it when I was really little, but no.
[06:44.200 --> 06:44.580]  But we should go.
[06:44.820 --> 06:45.000]  Okay.
[06:45.300 --> 06:46.280]  Here's the Baker Bowl.
[06:46.720 --> 06:47.820]  We all remember the...
[06:47.820 --> 06:48.540]  Haven't been there.
[06:48.600 --> 06:49.780]  ...world famous Baker Bowl.
[06:49.800 --> 06:50.780]  It's a baseball field?
[06:51.360 --> 06:53.660]  It was built in 1887 by the Philadelphia...
[06:54.240 --> 06:54.720]  It's a Philadelphia.
[06:54.720 --> 06:55.540]  Philadelphia, gotcha.
[06:55.920 --> 06:57.740]  Is that where the Phillies play now?
[06:58.680 --> 06:59.840]  Yeah, they play in the...
[06:59.840 --> 07:00.740]  No, I don't think so.
[07:01.700 --> 07:03.840]  I would imagine probably not.
[07:05.420 --> 07:06.580]  Panic of 1893.
[07:06.880 --> 07:08.520]  Do you remember how scary that was?
[07:08.520 --> 07:10.820]  Where were you when the Panic of 1893 happened?
[07:10.960 --> 07:12.200]  Do you remember why they were panicking?
[07:12.880 --> 07:13.560]  It was the Redding...
[07:14.080 --> 07:15.080]  God, this is just like fucking...
[07:15.080 --> 07:16.700]  By the way, this is like reading Monopoly.
[07:17.120 --> 07:17.480]  Everything...
[07:18.260 --> 07:21.260]  The Redding and Philadelphia Railroads went bankrupt.
[07:21.660 --> 07:22.960]  Oh, fuck.
[07:23.360 --> 07:23.940]  Dude, I've been reading...
[07:23.940 --> 07:24.660]  Did they have to go to jail?
[07:25.260 --> 07:26.340]  They went straight to jail.
[07:26.460 --> 07:27.020]  They did not pass...
[07:28.320 --> 07:32.340]  I've been reading a book on the industrialization of the railroads, and it's fucking fascinating.
[07:32.500 --> 07:33.480]  Was it the Redding Railroad?
[07:34.280 --> 07:35.120]  It's in there, yeah.
[07:35.140 --> 07:35.340]  Yeah.
[07:37.000 --> 07:37.720]  Leo Tolstoy.
[07:37.720 --> 07:39.020]  True Americana.
[07:39.360 --> 07:39.800]  True...
[07:39.800 --> 07:40.900]  Well, Gilded Age.
[07:41.000 --> 07:41.640]  True Americana.
[07:41.780 --> 07:43.980]  Hell of an author, that Leo Tolstoy.
[07:44.420 --> 07:45.300]  Oh, here we go.
[07:45.940 --> 07:46.620]  Georges Seurat.
[07:47.140 --> 07:48.340]  Look, you can pretend like you're...
[07:48.340 --> 07:52.500]  You can put it right there, and then you can pretend like you're in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
[07:53.220 --> 07:54.560]  Yeah, they did stare at that thing.
[07:54.740 --> 07:56.100]  Gotta get closer and closer.
[07:56.880 --> 07:58.840]  Then we have Edgar Degas.
[07:59.080 --> 07:59.480]  Ooh.
[07:59.840 --> 08:01.580]  And then we have Mary Ann Nichols.
[08:01.640 --> 08:04.680]  We all remember Mary Ann Nichols as the...
[08:04.680 --> 08:05.420]  Murder victim?
[08:06.080 --> 08:07.760]  First victim of Jack the Ripper.
[08:08.260 --> 08:08.660]  Yay!
[08:10.020 --> 08:11.980]  God, this guy is a fountain of knowledge.
[08:13.280 --> 08:15.580]  Dude, Eric is so much dumber than you.
[08:15.640 --> 08:16.500]  I love having you around.
[08:16.580 --> 08:17.060]  This is great.
[08:17.640 --> 08:18.780]  Here's Paul Gauguin.
[08:19.100 --> 08:20.060]  Beautiful little art.
[08:20.200 --> 08:20.980]  A lot of art in this one.
[08:21.240 --> 08:23.820]  And then the Olympics in Athens, back from the...
[08:23.820 --> 08:25.380]  I guess that's when...
[08:25.380 --> 08:25.720]  The first Olympics.
[08:25.720 --> 08:26.340]  The original one?
[08:26.420 --> 08:26.540]  Yeah.
[08:26.640 --> 08:28.560]  Back in, like, zero or whatever.
[08:28.600 --> 08:28.940]  I think so.
[08:29.580 --> 08:30.700]  All right, that's what that is.
[08:30.740 --> 08:31.960]  Now we're gonna open up these...
[08:31.960 --> 08:32.820]  You're gonna love these.
[08:32.820 --> 08:34.820]  These are...
[08:35.380 --> 08:36.840]  Spring Break Boosted Packs.
[08:36.940 --> 08:37.840]  This is from Mischief.
[08:38.140 --> 08:40.940]  Do you think Pauly Shore is in this for Spring Break?
[08:41.000 --> 08:41.440]  I hope so.
[08:42.020 --> 08:43.020]  I really hope so.
[08:43.200 --> 08:44.180]  Oh, he's dressed up as an armadillo.
[08:46.200 --> 08:47.120]  I fucked it up.
[08:47.380 --> 08:48.160]  Yeah, this seems like...
[08:48.160 --> 08:48.580]  It's hard to open.
[08:48.580 --> 08:49.660]  I think it's notched on the other side.
[08:49.820 --> 08:50.480]  I didn't open from.
[08:50.880 --> 08:52.180]  It was notched on this side.
[08:52.780 --> 08:53.720]  The notch broke.
[08:53.840 --> 08:54.320]  You're getting it.
[08:55.400 --> 08:57.140]  So I think Grandpa needs some scissors.
[08:57.280 --> 08:58.460]  If we can fly some scissors in for him.
[08:58.640 --> 08:59.780]  Wait, don't you have a box cutter?
[09:00.020 --> 09:00.320]  Yes.
[09:00.700 --> 09:01.280]  Oh, it's in there.
[09:01.280 --> 09:03.120]  Oh, I do have it though.
[09:03.120 --> 09:04.600]  I can get it, I can get it, I can get it.
[09:04.640 --> 09:05.060]  Oh, brother.
[09:06.600 --> 09:07.460]  Try some noises.
[09:08.620 --> 09:09.460]  There you go.
[09:11.240 --> 09:11.880]  That's an angry cat.
[09:11.980 --> 09:13.020]  Thanks for filling in.
[09:13.140 --> 09:13.760]  Yeah, we got it.
[09:14.180 --> 09:14.660]  For vamping.
[09:14.940 --> 09:15.660]  Slice towards you.
[09:15.700 --> 09:17.940]  Slice towards the gut.
[09:18.000 --> 09:18.920]  Slice towards victory.
[09:21.360 --> 09:22.080]  All right.
[09:22.160 --> 09:24.000]  So this is Spring Break Boosters.
[09:24.360 --> 09:26.460]  So is this like supplemental to normal Spring Break?
[09:26.560 --> 09:27.100]  Yeah, here you go.
[09:27.160 --> 09:30.440]  So here's an open water diver card.
[09:30.440 --> 09:31.540]  There you go.
[09:31.600 --> 09:32.280]  Classic Spring Break.
[09:32.600 --> 09:33.440]  Here's a...
[09:36.180 --> 09:36.820]  Bingo Bob.
[09:38.980 --> 09:40.300]  Business debit card.
[09:40.940 --> 09:41.260]  Mastercard.
[09:41.600 --> 09:42.940]  So these have money on them, by the way.
[09:43.080 --> 09:43.500]  Do they really?
[09:43.520 --> 09:44.760]  They have like a dollar or like ten dollars.
[09:44.780 --> 09:45.080]  Really?
[09:45.220 --> 09:46.440]  Yeah, some of them have up to a hundred dollars.
[09:46.440 --> 09:47.180]  Which one? Pull it.
[09:47.500 --> 09:49.000]  Who just showed it?
[09:49.020 --> 09:49.740]  It's for you, Gus.
[09:49.880 --> 09:50.560]  We were talking about this earlier.
[09:51.120 --> 09:51.560]  There's a card.
[09:51.620 --> 09:54.860]  Your sex partner just told you that he or she has been diagnosed with chlamydia.
[09:54.980 --> 09:55.840]  Get tested, get treated.
[09:57.040 --> 09:57.800]  So you can take that.
[09:58.260 --> 09:59.400]  Chlamydia is just like a...
[09:59.400 --> 10:03.500]  Then here's an IMAX movie stub ticket to 22 Jump Street.
[10:03.560 --> 10:05.200]  They have a Spring Break scene at the end of that movie, right?
[10:05.200 --> 10:05.840]  That's why it's in there.
[10:05.940 --> 10:07.880]  And then two tickets to Dave & Buster's.
[10:08.060 --> 10:09.000]  Hey, congrats.
[10:09.100 --> 10:09.440]  There you go.
[10:09.500 --> 10:10.760]  You can get a plastic mustache.
[10:11.500 --> 10:12.200]  We'll hold on to that.
[10:13.940 --> 10:14.300]  Now...
[10:14.300 --> 10:15.500]  The show's paying for itself.
[10:16.580 --> 10:18.420]  We're gonna open up one more Gilded Age pack.
[10:18.780 --> 10:19.780]  Just because Eric hates them.
[10:20.860 --> 10:22.740]  Eric, I don't know why you hate these.
[10:22.820 --> 10:23.360]  He already went home.
[10:23.460 --> 10:23.880]  They're great.
[10:24.020 --> 10:25.460]  He was like, the second this starts, I'm leaving.
[10:26.480 --> 10:27.200]  Shuler Colfax.
[10:27.800 --> 10:28.520]  He's a...
[10:28.520 --> 10:29.380]  Oh, you know who he is.
[10:29.540 --> 10:29.860]  Gus.
[10:31.300 --> 10:33.520]  He was an industrial magnate.
[10:33.720 --> 10:34.500]  Journalism businessman.
[10:36.420 --> 10:37.360]  Gus, what was the...
[10:38.520 --> 10:39.160]  Golden Jubilee.
[10:39.800 --> 10:40.620]  Emily, you know what that is, right?
[10:40.820 --> 10:43.640]  Is that when they lit up the thing?
[10:43.880 --> 10:48.080]  That's when Queen Victoria celebrated her 50th year of reign.
[10:48.440 --> 10:49.580]  We were there for the Golden...
[10:50.180 --> 10:51.420]  No, the Diamond Jubilee.
[10:51.560 --> 10:53.260]  I think that was the first time there had ever been a diamond.
[10:53.280 --> 10:54.920]  We were there in town for that.
[10:55.060 --> 10:56.160]  Did you see the hologram of the Queen?
[10:56.160 --> 10:58.540]  No, we were there right before...
[10:58.540 --> 10:59.500]  I think we left right before it started.
[10:59.620 --> 11:00.220]  Yeah, right before...
[11:01.020 --> 11:02.140]  Yeah, it was like her birthday or something?
[11:02.300 --> 11:02.500]  Yeah.
[11:02.860 --> 11:03.140]  Yeah.
[11:05.840 --> 11:06.640]  Victoria Woodhill.
[11:07.340 --> 11:07.740]  Woodhull.
[11:08.220 --> 11:09.540]  You remember, Gus.
[11:09.560 --> 11:10.500]  A suffragette?
[11:12.340 --> 11:12.860]  Let me see here.
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.660]  She was a...
[11:15.660 --> 11:16.400]  This is interesting.
[11:16.740 --> 11:20.200]  She was a fortune medium and then opened a brokerage firm on Wall Street.
[11:20.600 --> 11:21.640]  Oh, sounds like a suffragette.
[11:21.700 --> 11:22.920]  Oh my God, Gus.
[11:23.380 --> 11:26.460]  She was the first woman to run for the presidency of the United States.
[11:26.480 --> 11:27.080]  A suffragist.
[11:27.760 --> 11:29.460]  She was a member of the Free Love Movement.
[11:29.500 --> 11:29.540]  Yay!
[11:29.960 --> 11:33.800]  Which advocated a woman's right to marry, divorce, and bear children without government interference.
[11:34.160 --> 11:35.360]  Hallelujah to that!
[11:35.420 --> 11:37.500]  You can kind of take a guess at most of these.
[11:37.560 --> 11:37.960]  Dude!
[11:38.100 --> 11:39.480]  Which is exactly what I'm doing.
[11:39.900 --> 11:40.960]  Gus is good at guessing.
[11:41.220 --> 11:41.980]  Lizzie Borden.
[11:42.260 --> 11:43.820]  You know about her?
[11:43.840 --> 11:44.600]  Everyone knows Lizzie Borden.
[11:44.860 --> 11:45.140]  Come on.
[11:45.400 --> 11:46.120]  Do you think she did it?
[11:46.660 --> 11:48.080]  What? The ex-murderer?
[11:48.200 --> 11:48.400]  Yeah.
[11:48.540 --> 11:48.620]  Yeah.
[11:49.580 --> 11:50.380]  Nikola Tesla.
[11:51.020 --> 11:51.960]  I prefer Elon.
[11:53.340 --> 11:54.560]  We've heard that about you.
[11:54.740 --> 11:56.820]  We've seen the forums you're on on Reddit.
[11:57.440 --> 11:58.680]  Statue of Liberty dedication.
[11:58.940 --> 11:59.600]  What's that?
[12:01.220 --> 12:02.980]  That's when they dedicated the Statue of Liberty to me.
[12:03.820 --> 12:05.240]  Boston Symphony Orchestra.
[12:06.500 --> 12:08.660]  Ooh, the Whitechapel murders.
[12:08.940 --> 12:10.060]  Emily, I'm assuming that's a murderer.
[12:10.200 --> 12:11.380]  I'm sure you're a white lady.
[12:11.380 --> 12:12.580]  I'm sure you know everything about it.
[12:12.620 --> 12:13.480]  Jack the Ripper shit.
[12:13.700 --> 12:14.520]  Whitechapel? Let's see.
[12:14.600 --> 12:14.780]  Could be.
[12:15.700 --> 12:16.580]  Oh, here we go.
[12:16.580 --> 12:21.580]  The Whitechapel murders were never solved due to a lack of evidence and limited investigation procedures in 1888.
[12:22.220 --> 12:24.480]  London's East End was filled with dismal slums.
[12:25.060 --> 12:26.400]  It wasn't Jack the Ripper.
[12:26.840 --> 12:27.820]  No, wait.
[12:27.920 --> 12:29.400]  It was a lot easier to kill people back then.
[12:29.520 --> 12:30.080]  It might have been.
[12:30.580 --> 12:30.720]  Yeah.
[12:30.720 --> 12:31.220]  Yeah, no.
[12:31.800 --> 12:35.000]  It's believed that Jack the Ripper was responsible for at least five of the Whitechapel murders.
[12:35.220 --> 12:35.420]  Okay.
[12:35.740 --> 12:36.160]  You nailed it.
[12:36.580 --> 12:37.340]  You know your murders.
[12:38.000 --> 12:39.500]  Cripple Creek Miner Strike.
[12:39.700 --> 12:40.920]  I'm on Cripple Creek.
[12:41.220 --> 12:44.020]  Yeah, that's a popular creek to sing about.
[12:44.100 --> 12:46.180]  It's a street named Cripple Creek up in North Austin.
[12:46.800 --> 12:47.480]  Is it really?
[12:47.640 --> 12:49.360]  Yeah, we had a friend who lived off of there for a while.
[12:49.620 --> 12:50.660]  Oh, okay.
[12:50.880 --> 12:51.900]  I'll take your word for it.
[12:51.900 --> 12:55.120]  And then here we have a refractor of the Panic of 1893.
[12:55.120 --> 12:57.160]  Hey, that's when the railroad crashed.
[12:58.560 --> 12:59.700]  Oh, you know a lot about it.
[12:59.700 --> 13:00.940]  I remember, yeah.
[13:01.560 --> 13:02.580]  Well, she watched the show.
[13:02.620 --> 13:03.920]  I'm ready for that show to come back.
[13:04.300 --> 13:06.140]  It's like my watch alone show.
[13:06.480 --> 13:07.760]  Geoff wants nothing to do with.
[13:08.020 --> 13:08.840]  Only the cards.
[13:09.000 --> 13:09.680]  What a pretender.
[13:09.960 --> 13:10.360]  What a poser.
[13:10.660 --> 13:14.860]  And last but not least, we'll open up these jackass cards because I'm really excited about jackass.
[13:14.860 --> 13:16.220]  I've been wanting to open them forever.
[13:16.420 --> 13:17.360]  You gonna get a Steve-O rookie card?
[13:17.820 --> 13:20.780]  No, but if you get an autographed Johnny Knoxville, they're good for like ten grand.
[13:21.060 --> 13:21.440]  Wow.
[13:22.120 --> 13:24.160]  Oh, the puken.
[13:24.540 --> 13:25.300]  The pukeno.
[13:27.340 --> 13:27.940]  That's beautiful.
[13:28.320 --> 13:28.860]  That's gross.
[13:29.300 --> 13:30.800]  Here we have Behind the Lens.
[13:31.440 --> 13:33.020]  It's a big explosion.
[13:33.200 --> 13:33.480]  Kind of cool.
[13:34.420 --> 13:36.120]  Hi, I'm Tony Hawk.
[13:36.440 --> 13:37.800]  That's a Tony Hawk card.
[13:38.200 --> 13:40.180]  Hi, I'm Danger Aaron.
[13:41.740 --> 13:43.760]  And then, oh, this is good.
[13:46.400 --> 13:46.800]  Pontasaurus.
[13:46.840 --> 13:47.700]  Oh, sick.
[13:47.700 --> 13:48.620]  So that's just a dinosaur.
[13:48.820 --> 13:50.840]  Yeah, that's when the dinosaur destroyed the city.
[13:50.960 --> 13:51.680]  That's just a dinosaur.
[13:51.840 --> 13:52.280]  Just a dinosaur.
[13:52.600 --> 13:53.720]  Just flopping around.
[13:54.840 --> 13:55.640]  All right.
[13:56.180 --> 13:56.580]  Okay.
[13:56.780 --> 13:59.920]  Oh, before we continue, I forgot to do this first off.
[14:01.520 --> 14:07.080]  Before we do anything, in earnest, we gotta take something from the pack sack and then we'll have to feed it later.
[14:07.680 --> 14:07.960]  Pack sack.
[14:08.280 --> 14:12.500]  We're gonna open up 1991 player flashcards from NFL Pro Football.
[14:13.100 --> 14:13.920]  There you go.
[14:13.940 --> 14:14.380]  Thank you.
[14:14.580 --> 14:17.420]  I've never seen this before in my life.
[14:17.420 --> 14:18.560]  99 cents.
[14:19.100 --> 14:19.160]  Pacific.
[14:19.200 --> 14:19.640]  Oh, Pacific.
[14:19.860 --> 14:20.740]  They're a dogshit company.
[14:20.920 --> 14:21.520]  Okay, let's see.
[14:21.760 --> 14:22.400]  But it's so shiny.
[14:23.400 --> 14:24.180]  What year was it?
[14:24.340 --> 14:25.460]  There's math on it?
[14:26.280 --> 14:28.380]  NFL Pro Football flashcards?
[14:28.900 --> 14:29.240]  What?
[14:30.080 --> 14:31.060]  Are you fucking serious?
[14:31.860 --> 14:32.240]  Oh, okay.
[14:33.840 --> 14:34.320]  Fuck.
[14:35.380 --> 14:36.460]  I thought it was...
[14:36.460 --> 14:38.360]  All right, there's Chris Miller.
[14:39.860 --> 14:41.620]  There's fucking Bob Nelson.
[14:41.620 --> 14:42.640]  Here's Lee Johnson.
[14:42.780 --> 14:44.100]  Who the fuck are these people?
[14:44.720 --> 14:45.480]  Derek Thinner.
[14:45.740 --> 14:47.220]  Oh, you've heard of Joe Montana.
[14:47.800 --> 14:49.220]  Just leave that.
[14:50.220 --> 14:51.180]  Michael Irvin.
[14:51.480 --> 14:51.760]  Okay.
[14:53.260 --> 14:54.860]  One of the OG rule breakers right there.
[14:54.860 --> 14:56.180]  Pablo Escobar was sad when he retired.
[14:57.420 --> 15:02.880]  Steve Christie, Neal Anderson, Charles McRae, and then Steve Young.
[15:03.060 --> 15:04.120]  What do you mean Pablo Escobar?
[15:04.560 --> 15:05.800]  Did he bet on him or something?
[15:05.920 --> 15:08.340]  I think Michael Irvin may have been one of his top customers.
[15:08.480 --> 15:09.080]  Oh, shit.
[15:09.680 --> 15:10.860]  He kept him in business.
[15:11.300 --> 15:13.180]  Kept that Dallas market going.
[15:13.360 --> 15:17.280]  I think a car that headed to Dallas nonstop was very busy in those days.
[15:17.520 --> 15:17.800]  Here we go.
[15:17.820 --> 15:18.800]  It's another one from the pack sack.
[15:18.940 --> 15:19.520]  Oh, real cards.
[15:20.140 --> 15:20.940]  Donner's basketball.
[15:21.500 --> 15:22.280]  21-22.
[15:22.380 --> 15:23.320]  I put this in the pack sack.
[15:23.460 --> 15:23.960]  Let's see what we got.
[15:24.860 --> 15:25.800]  Oh, Jalen Brunson.
[15:26.040 --> 15:27.300]  No longer with the Dallas Mavericks.
[15:27.800 --> 15:28.880]  Fuck that up, Dallas.
[15:29.180 --> 15:30.740]  Now he's a superstar for the Knicks.
[15:31.060 --> 15:31.340]  They got Kyrie?
[15:32.360 --> 15:33.060]  Yeah, they did.
[15:33.180 --> 15:33.880]  They're stuck with Kyrie.
[15:34.160 --> 15:39.500]  Alexey Pokachevsky, who was the tallest dude on Oklahoma City until they got Chet.
[15:39.500 --> 15:41.340]  And now nobody gives a shit about Alexey because they have Chet.
[15:41.480 --> 15:42.420]  But Chet's hurt anyway.
[15:42.560 --> 15:44.740]  So the twin towers of dudes that don't play.
[15:45.100 --> 15:47.100]  Michael Porter Jr., MPJ.
[15:48.440 --> 15:50.460]  Now he's a world champion.
[15:51.100 --> 15:52.880]  And here's his teammate, Jamal Murray.
[15:53.180 --> 15:54.040]  They won the NBA title.
[15:54.360 --> 15:54.800]  Nuggets?
[15:54.940 --> 15:57.060]  Chris Paul, who now plays for the Golden State Warriors.
[15:57.380 --> 15:57.980]  Fucking weird.
[15:58.160 --> 15:58.740]  That is weird.
[15:59.480 --> 16:03.400]  Chris Boucher, who was almost out of the NBA a couple times and still hanging on.
[16:04.840 --> 16:05.600]  Donovan Mitchell.
[16:05.980 --> 16:07.600]  Spider is his nickname.
[16:07.820 --> 16:08.160]  Spider?
[16:08.160 --> 16:08.660]  Spider.
[16:08.760 --> 16:09.540]  Because he's got eight arms.
[16:09.640 --> 16:09.880]  Yeah.
[16:10.100 --> 16:11.380]  Just like tarantula?
[16:11.840 --> 16:12.740]  Yeah, like the tarantula.
[16:13.020 --> 16:15.200]  He's one of two spider-related NBA nicknames.
[16:15.420 --> 16:18.420]  And then Rashaun Holmes, green...
[16:18.420 --> 16:18.760]  What?
[16:18.980 --> 16:19.320]  Orange.
[16:19.820 --> 16:20.520]  Orange and purple.
[16:20.760 --> 16:21.560]  Orange, whatever.
[16:21.860 --> 16:22.620]  Do you want it or no?
[16:23.000 --> 16:23.560]  Let me sleep.
[16:24.220 --> 16:25.000]  I'm really good at that.
[16:25.200 --> 16:26.380]  Okay, Gus, let's get to your shit.
[16:26.540 --> 16:26.720]  Okay.
[16:27.300 --> 16:28.140]  You ready for this?
[16:28.220 --> 16:28.900]  Gonna dump all this out?
[16:29.460 --> 16:29.960]  Oh boy.
[16:30.200 --> 16:30.420]  Oh boy.
[16:30.860 --> 16:32.220]  Oh my God.
[16:32.920 --> 16:33.520]  It's so heavy.
[16:34.480 --> 16:35.040]  Puffy flake.
[16:35.040 --> 16:35.400]  Oh my God.
[16:35.680 --> 16:36.240]  Okay, let's...
[16:36.860 --> 16:37.080]  You ready?
[16:37.080 --> 16:38.520]  Careful of the Barbies.
[16:39.340 --> 16:40.660]  Take them to high ground.
[16:40.800 --> 16:41.500]  Oh no.
[16:51.390 --> 16:52.090]  Oh boy.
[16:52.630 --> 16:53.230]  Oh boy.
[16:53.530 --> 16:53.930]  Okay.
[16:55.990 --> 16:56.650]  Yeah, that works.
[16:58.790 --> 16:59.990]  That's just under half of them.
[17:00.350 --> 17:01.410]  Do you think we can do all these in an hour?
[17:01.910 --> 17:02.790]  Oh my God.
[17:02.930 --> 17:04.530]  I think we could do a few.
[17:05.210 --> 17:05.910]  Well, what do we got?
[17:05.930 --> 17:06.730]  We got a lot of 89...
[17:06.730 --> 17:08.010]  Oh no, my organized ones.
[17:10.070 --> 17:11.910]  Twelve-year-old me would be so sad.
[17:11.910 --> 17:14.330]  And your Sports Illustrated presents...
[17:14.330 --> 17:14.950]  Oh!
[17:15.410 --> 17:17.080]  ...a season to remember, Dallas Cowboys 1995.
[17:17.830 --> 17:18.870]  Do you think Michael Irvin's in there?
[17:18.970 --> 17:21.150]  What do you think the first advertisement is when you open it up?
[17:21.370 --> 17:21.670]  Cigarettes.
[17:22.590 --> 17:22.970]  Hey!
[17:24.290 --> 17:25.130]  There you go.
[17:25.130 --> 17:25.670]  That's what's up.
[17:25.830 --> 17:27.370]  Nothing says sports like cigarettes.
[17:27.450 --> 17:27.690]  Yep.
[17:28.010 --> 17:28.790]  Gotta love it.
[17:29.230 --> 17:29.770]  Dude, that's awesome.
[17:29.790 --> 17:30.850]  Probably after one of their championships.
[17:31.370 --> 17:31.750]  85?
[17:32.050 --> 17:32.150]  Yeah.
[17:32.270 --> 17:32.550]  Wow.
[17:32.710 --> 17:33.990]  Jesus Christ, Gus.
[17:34.130 --> 17:35.790]  These sports lockers are so cute.
[17:35.830 --> 17:36.290]  Yeah, they are.
[17:36.370 --> 17:36.790]  This is like...
[17:36.790 --> 17:41.230]  Those are the ones, like, when I would open the cards, I would organize them by team.
[17:41.230 --> 17:42.610]  So, that's what those lockers are.
[17:42.850 --> 17:44.290]  Like, those are not unopened packs.
[17:44.350 --> 17:46.010]  Those have been opened and gone through.
[17:46.350 --> 17:47.090]  So, here's what we can do.
[17:47.170 --> 17:47.690]  Let's just...
[17:47.690 --> 17:49.330]  Oh, let me move your...
[17:49.330 --> 17:49.950]  out of your face.
[17:49.970 --> 17:50.710]  Geoff, you're making a mess.
[17:51.690 --> 17:52.010]  Oh!
[17:52.890 --> 17:53.810]  God damn, Gus.
[17:54.010 --> 17:56.730]  I can't believe we're finally doing this.
[17:56.770 --> 17:58.290]  We've been talking about this for so fucking long.
[17:58.330 --> 17:59.830]  And this has been sitting by your desk for how long?
[17:59.850 --> 18:00.710]  I think everyone...
[18:01.070 --> 18:02.270]  A little over a year at this point.
[18:02.290 --> 18:04.710]  I think everyone in the office is gonna be glad...
[18:04.710 --> 18:05.490]  ...that this has gotten...
[18:05.490 --> 18:05.610]  ...that this has gotten...
[18:05.610 --> 18:06.750]  I'm gonna feed the pack sack.
[18:06.890 --> 18:07.390]  Of course.
[18:07.730 --> 18:09.110]  You wanna put one of the Donrels in there, too?
[18:09.270 --> 18:09.830]  Yeah, let's do it.
[18:09.830 --> 18:10.390]  I'm gonna do it.
[18:10.450 --> 18:12.310]  There's not as many of the Donrels as the other ones.
[18:12.310 --> 18:12.810]  Oh, here we go.
[18:13.010 --> 18:15.070]  Do you think you have other kinds at...
[18:15.070 --> 18:16.230]  Oh, yeah, I definitely have other ones.
[18:16.890 --> 18:17.670]  We're gonna go through.
[18:18.490 --> 18:19.130]  1990 Fleer.
[18:19.310 --> 18:20.250]  Emily, would you do me a favor?
[18:20.270 --> 18:20.470]  Yeah.
[18:21.930 --> 18:23.850]  On my phone here, I have...
[18:25.930 --> 18:26.570]  Most valuable...
[18:27.810 --> 18:28.850]  Your sister texted me.
[18:28.890 --> 18:29.430]  I wonder what that's about.
[18:29.610 --> 18:30.830]  Most valuable...
[18:33.150 --> 18:34.510]  1990 Fleer cards.
[18:34.970 --> 18:36.190]  So, that's this.
[18:36.510 --> 18:38.070]  So, if you go from the top...
[18:38.070 --> 18:43.250]  And tell us what the PSA 10 value for some of these is as we get to...
[18:43.470 --> 18:45.550]  So, we're gonna get a pack of sticker...
[18:45.550 --> 18:46.770]  A sticker per pack.
[18:46.970 --> 18:47.430]  Is there any gum?
[18:47.610 --> 18:48.290]  Do I get to eat gum?
[18:48.970 --> 18:50.810]  I think they've replaced gum with stickers in these.
[18:50.950 --> 18:52.270]  But there might be some in the Donrels.
[18:52.410 --> 18:54.010]  So, do you want me to tell you that right now?
[18:54.010 --> 18:57.090]  Bruce Ruffin, Ted Aguero, Tom Candiotti, Mike Gallego.
[18:57.090 --> 18:58.630]  I'm gonna ask you when I get one of them.
[18:59.570 --> 19:00.210]  Rance Mullinix.
[19:01.430 --> 19:01.610]  Whoa.
[19:01.730 --> 19:03.290]  Which, uh...
[19:04.090 --> 19:05.530]  What's our accountant?
[19:05.990 --> 19:06.130]  Oh.
[19:06.730 --> 19:07.870]  I don't know if we can do accountant.
[19:08.410 --> 19:08.850]  Or...
[19:08.850 --> 19:09.130]  What do you think?
[19:10.070 --> 19:10.510]  Stepdad?
[19:11.510 --> 19:12.490]  He's a little...
[19:12.490 --> 19:13.890]  But he's like the nice stepdad.
[19:13.990 --> 19:15.070]  He's the dad who steps up.
[19:15.710 --> 19:17.370]  He's the stepdad that stepped up.
[19:17.390 --> 19:18.130]  Yeah, he stepped up.
[19:18.210 --> 19:19.230]  Let's make a step up.
[19:19.670 --> 19:20.210]  Rance Fox.
[19:20.430 --> 19:21.090]  I'm gonna say it.
[19:22.730 --> 19:24.790]  Lance Parrish, Gino Petrale.
[19:25.130 --> 19:25.990]  Oh, Gus, look at this.
[19:26.030 --> 19:26.990]  I've never seen this card before.
[19:27.650 --> 19:29.470]  Geoff Russell, Mark Kubiska.
[19:29.710 --> 19:30.770]  Two dudes I've never heard of.
[19:31.310 --> 19:33.070]  They were superstars in their own...
[19:33.070 --> 19:34.170]  And they were friends.
[19:34.390 --> 19:34.610]  Oh.
[19:35.470 --> 19:38.270]  Should we have a, uh...
[19:39.010 --> 19:40.950]  I don't know if we should call this, like...
[19:40.950 --> 19:43.190]  Saw a ghost or low T cell count or what?
[19:43.310 --> 19:43.890]  Oh my god.
[19:44.090 --> 19:44.530]  Not well?
[19:44.970 --> 19:45.410]  Not well.
[19:48.850 --> 19:50.470]  Bob Welch died the next day.
[19:50.610 --> 19:51.990]  Wait, is it Welch?
[19:52.150 --> 19:52.630]  Bob Welch.
[19:52.650 --> 19:54.230]  That could be food for Welches.
[19:54.830 --> 19:56.490]  But I think he's not well.
[19:56.810 --> 19:57.530]  Not well.
[19:57.630 --> 19:58.250]  Welch not well.
[19:58.590 --> 19:59.610]  Let's put that somewhere.
[20:00.710 --> 20:01.430]  Geoff Huston.
[20:01.490 --> 20:03.570]  He looks like he's about to fucking take that bat to somebody.
[20:03.570 --> 20:06.610]  He looks like his mom's about to drop him off at Little League practice.
[20:07.530 --> 20:08.290]  Geoff Hamilton.
[20:08.650 --> 20:09.630]  Dennis Martinez.
[20:09.970 --> 20:10.350]  Oh!
[20:11.070 --> 20:12.310]  I bet this is on that list.
[20:12.490 --> 20:13.470]  Greg Maddox, Emily.
[20:13.610 --> 20:14.470]  Oh, shit.
[20:15.310 --> 20:15.590]  I'm sorry.
[20:15.750 --> 20:16.450]  Oh, it's okay.
[20:16.690 --> 20:17.270]  I'll do it.
[20:17.350 --> 20:18.110]  Put your face on there.
[20:19.830 --> 20:20.510]  What do we got?
[20:20.810 --> 20:22.030]  We're looking for Jose Uribe.
[20:22.150 --> 20:22.770]  I need to remember that.
[20:22.870 --> 20:23.530]  I always forget about Uribe.
[20:24.230 --> 20:24.990]  Griffey, obviously.
[20:25.150 --> 20:25.850]  Ricky Henderson.
[20:26.090 --> 20:26.590]  Bo Jackson.
[20:26.750 --> 20:27.890]  Tony Gwynn.
[20:27.970 --> 20:28.630]  Cal Ripken Jr.
[20:28.730 --> 20:29.350]  Nolan Ryan.
[20:29.510 --> 20:30.250]  Don Mattingly.
[20:30.950 --> 20:31.630]  Kirby Puckett.
[20:31.650 --> 20:32.130]  Bo Jackson.
[20:32.130 --> 20:32.950]  Larry Walker.
[20:33.730 --> 20:34.450]  Kirby Puckett.
[20:34.470 --> 20:35.750]  I got Kirby Puckett on the box here.
[20:35.950 --> 20:36.270]  Dale Murphy.
[20:36.510 --> 20:36.950]  That counts.
[20:37.130 --> 20:37.290]  Oh!
[20:37.650 --> 20:38.550]  Uh, Sandberg.
[20:39.310 --> 20:39.990]  George Brett.
[20:40.550 --> 20:41.030]  Who was I looking at?
[20:41.030 --> 20:42.550]  It's actually different on the bottom of every...
[20:43.090 --> 20:43.270]  Oh!
[20:43.470 --> 20:44.730]  Is there no fucking Greg Maddox?
[20:45.870 --> 20:46.490]  What do you need?
[20:46.710 --> 20:47.010]  All right.
[20:47.110 --> 20:48.210]  Is Greg Maddox not worth anything?
[20:48.690 --> 20:49.210]  That's bullshit.
[20:50.530 --> 20:51.230]  Oh, Juan Gonzalez.
[20:51.370 --> 20:52.030]  We just bought...
[20:52.030 --> 20:52.530]  Got his basement.
[20:52.610 --> 20:53.830]  It has Roger Clemens on it.
[20:53.930 --> 20:54.790]  Got Kirby Puckett.
[20:54.870 --> 20:55.450]  Ken Griffey Jr.
[20:55.530 --> 20:56.650]  All right, well, I guess...
[20:56.650 --> 20:58.110]  I guess they don't care about Greg Maddox.
[20:58.930 --> 20:59.430]  We care.
[20:59.670 --> 20:59.990]  We care.
[20:59.990 --> 21:01.050]  Yeah, I guess he was too far into this.
[21:01.050 --> 21:02.170]  All right, Scott Geraltz.
[21:02.950 --> 21:03.790]  Jose de Leon.
[21:03.950 --> 21:06.710]  And Ron Gant, I believe, is one of the ones.
[21:06.910 --> 21:09.130]  Will you look and see if...
[21:09.130 --> 21:09.630]  Is it?
[21:10.510 --> 21:11.850]  Yeah, is this Ron Gant's rookie card?
[21:13.090 --> 21:13.270]  No.
[21:13.270 --> 21:14.630]  I feel like I need to, like, write this down.
[21:14.770 --> 21:16.090]  No, it wouldn't be worth anything.
[21:16.350 --> 21:16.710]  That's fine.
[21:17.190 --> 21:17.750]  Here's a has-been.
[21:17.750 --> 21:18.230]  Moving on.
[21:18.790 --> 21:19.430]  Moving on.
[21:19.550 --> 21:20.610]  Ron Gant played for the Braves.
[21:21.070 --> 21:21.690]  I liked him.
[21:21.810 --> 21:25.950]  Oh, I think this box also actually has some other kinds of cards in here, if I remember right.
[21:25.950 --> 21:26.250]  Oh!
[21:26.490 --> 21:27.170]  We'll go into that, too.
[21:27.230 --> 21:28.930]  Oh, yeah, I think there were Bowman in that I may have looked at.
[21:28.970 --> 21:31.030]  What year was, uh, the Fuckface card in?
[21:32.270 --> 21:33.270]  Fuckface card.
[21:33.470 --> 21:34.950]  Billy Ripken, 89 Fleer.
[21:35.130 --> 21:37.050]  There's some, oh, Peter and Bowman here.
[21:37.470 --> 21:37.850]  We'll do that.
[21:38.210 --> 21:38.930]  I'll open that next.
[21:39.010 --> 21:39.890]  Tim McIntosh.
[21:40.170 --> 21:41.650]  Uh, Matt Winters.
[21:41.990 --> 21:42.810]  Randy Myers.
[21:43.390 --> 21:44.170]  Cory Snyder.
[21:45.250 --> 21:46.490]  Todd Benzinger.
[21:47.090 --> 21:48.330]  Martin Clary.
[21:48.590 --> 21:49.350]  Randy Kramer.
[21:49.690 --> 21:50.310]  Scott Bradley.
[21:50.750 --> 21:51.910]  Jose de Leon.
[21:52.630 --> 21:53.870]  Mike Greenwell.
[21:54.090 --> 21:55.270]  Ron Kittle.
[21:55.710 --> 21:56.330]  Who's another...
[21:57.890 --> 21:58.530]  Just...
[21:58.530 --> 22:00.310]  Man, they made glasses ugly.
[22:01.590 --> 22:02.230]  Chris Hammond.
[22:02.250 --> 22:03.510]  And then, oh, there's a...
[22:03.510 --> 22:03.950]  He's like a tie-tie.
[22:04.150 --> 22:04.950]  Geoff Huston again.
[22:05.670 --> 22:06.910]  He's gonna be in every pack, isn't he?
[22:07.450 --> 22:09.110]  That's the one that's like, ready to go to practice.
[22:09.330 --> 22:10.310]  He's like, I'm fuckin' ready.
[22:10.890 --> 22:12.070]  I was thinking about this the other day.
[22:12.150 --> 22:13.830]  Wouldn't it be fun if we'd...
[22:13.830 --> 22:17.010]  It was kind of what the original idea with Zimmer was, but I kind of got away from it.
[22:17.250 --> 22:20.130]  Wouldn't it be fun to just pick one of these cards, like, Gary...
[22:20.130 --> 22:20.770]  No, not Gary Wayne.
[22:20.810 --> 22:25.530]  Maybe Lee Stevens here, and just say, we're gonna collect every Lee Stevens 1990 Fleer card.
[22:26.250 --> 22:27.570]  Just have people send them in.
[22:27.910 --> 22:28.850]  Or hold onto them.
[22:28.970 --> 22:29.670]  Just corner the market.
[22:29.670 --> 22:30.470]  Let's see how many we can...
[22:30.470 --> 22:33.310]  Yeah, how many we can account for.
[22:33.390 --> 22:40.770]  Pete Harnish, Alan Davis, Geoff Ennis, Geoffrey Leonard, Dennis Cook, Charlie O'Brien, Andy Allison, Jesus Christ.
[22:40.950 --> 22:41.430]  These guys.
[22:41.770 --> 22:42.250]  He's in there?
[22:42.310 --> 22:42.550]  Jesus?
[22:42.770 --> 22:43.490]  David Wells.
[22:44.210 --> 22:47.670]  Do we have a body parts section?
[22:47.730 --> 22:48.210]  I'm ready.
[22:48.410 --> 22:48.750]  Anatomy?
[22:48.770 --> 22:49.550]  Dick Schofield.
[22:50.030 --> 22:50.950]  That's good.
[22:51.390 --> 22:52.310]  Harold Baines.
[22:52.410 --> 22:53.630]  Oh, here we go.
[22:53.990 --> 22:55.490]  Howard Johnson, Ryan Sandberg.
[22:55.570 --> 22:56.070]  That's cute.
[22:56.630 --> 22:57.690]  And then Dave Henderson.
[22:58.090 --> 22:59.270]  There's a buddy card that is on here.
[22:59.570 --> 23:00.150]  There's one Lola?
[23:00.310 --> 23:01.110]  There's a buddy card.
[23:01.290 --> 23:03.010]  Yeah, but it's Bo Jackson and somebody else.
[23:03.050 --> 23:03.790]  Yeah, it's only $25.
[23:05.990 --> 23:08.010]  It's Nolan Ryan and Mike Scott.
[23:08.150 --> 23:09.690]  Oh, there's another one that's Bo Jackson too, I think.
[23:10.510 --> 23:11.970]  Oh, this is a nice little royal sticker.
[23:12.210 --> 23:12.790]  A biggin'.
[23:12.790 --> 23:13.290]  Isn't that cute?
[23:14.390 --> 23:22.750]  Okay, Brett Saberhagen, Carmelo Martinez, Steve Balboni, Rick Roden, Jim Abbott.
[23:23.430 --> 23:25.030]  Oh, that might be something, huh?
[23:25.090 --> 23:26.130]  You might want to look that up.
[23:26.310 --> 23:27.070]  Jim Abbott might be in there.
[23:27.070 --> 23:32.070]  Dave Steeb, Dave Parker, Steve Jelts, Mike...
[23:33.930 --> 23:35.910]  I don't know what to think about Mike Flanagan.
[23:36.890 --> 23:37.770]  Do we have a...
[23:37.770 --> 23:39.930]  You know what his picture is?
[23:39.990 --> 23:40.430]  What?
[23:41.450 --> 23:42.370]  Oh, gosh.
[23:42.670 --> 23:43.290]  This one?
[23:43.490 --> 23:43.970]  Oh, boy.
[23:44.170 --> 23:44.850]  No, no, no, that's not it.
[23:44.890 --> 23:45.790]  I'm sorry, sorry, I'm so sorry.
[23:46.630 --> 23:46.970]  Never mind.
[23:47.170 --> 23:47.370]  Go on.
[23:47.430 --> 23:47.770]  Okay.
[23:47.970 --> 23:48.850]  I lost it.
[23:49.130 --> 23:50.390]  There's one that's like...
[23:50.390 --> 23:50.890]  Oh, this one.
[23:51.350 --> 23:52.310]  Oh, boy!
[23:52.550 --> 23:52.770]  Yeah.
[23:53.210 --> 23:53.970]  Like, that's him.
[23:54.810 --> 23:55.690]  Oh, boy!
[23:56.090 --> 23:57.330]  Like, he's like, I did it!
[23:57.390 --> 23:58.090]  That totally is.
[23:58.530 --> 23:59.010]  Oh, boys.
[24:00.430 --> 24:00.990]  Kirby Puckett.
[24:01.390 --> 24:02.390]  Oh, that was on the list, wasn't it?
[24:02.570 --> 24:04.050]  I think Kirby Puckett might have been on the list.
[24:04.150 --> 24:04.610]  Let's put it aside.
[24:04.670 --> 24:05.830]  This is off-center, but that's okay.
[24:06.810 --> 24:09.150]  I guess I'm going to make you a bunch of money today.
[24:09.470 --> 24:10.370]  J. Bell, Terry Pendleton.
[24:10.850 --> 24:12.070]  A nickel at a time.
[24:12.690 --> 24:13.030]  What's that?
[24:13.110 --> 24:13.990]  A nickel at a time.
[24:14.690 --> 24:15.350]  Some of these cards...
[24:15.350 --> 24:15.730]  You want to hit this?
[24:16.150 --> 24:16.830]  Yeah, let's do that.
[24:16.950 --> 24:17.710]  Let's open up...
[24:18.750 --> 24:20.690]  So, those are 89s and these are 90 Bowman.
[24:20.910 --> 24:21.870]  89 Bowman.
[24:22.130 --> 24:22.410]  Oof.
[24:22.610 --> 24:23.590]  What are we going to get in there?
[24:23.630 --> 24:24.690]  I'm not even going to look at the list.
[24:24.690 --> 24:25.730]  There's some other weird stuff in here.
[24:25.810 --> 24:26.730]  Oh, here's your gum, Gus.
[24:27.130 --> 24:27.650]  Thank you.
[24:27.730 --> 24:28.670]  Oh, this is the initiation.
[24:28.970 --> 24:29.130]  Check this out.
[24:30.410 --> 24:31.170]  What the hell are these?
[24:31.810 --> 24:33.170]  Oh, you have collectibooks!
[24:33.570 --> 24:34.510]  I remember those.
[24:34.850 --> 24:36.390]  Did it already come broken in three parts?
[24:36.490 --> 24:36.710]  Yeah.
[24:36.710 --> 24:36.950]  Yeah.
[24:37.330 --> 24:38.270]  It's over time.
[24:39.570 --> 24:40.350]  Raphael Santana.
[24:40.390 --> 24:40.710]  Welcome!
[24:41.550 --> 24:42.530]  You're one of us.
[24:42.530 --> 24:42.850]  Yay!
[24:42.970 --> 24:43.870]  One of us!
[24:44.050 --> 24:44.910]  One of us!
[24:45.030 --> 24:46.070]  Rick Rochelle.
[24:47.290 --> 24:48.090]  Al Newman.
[24:48.630 --> 24:49.570]  These are weird cards.
[24:49.690 --> 24:50.970]  I remember being excited about them when they came out.
[24:51.030 --> 24:51.910]  Mike Moore.
[24:53.790 --> 24:54.590]  Bob Welch.
[24:54.690 --> 24:56.470]  I think he's a...
[24:56.470 --> 24:56.670]  Yuck!
[24:58.930 --> 24:59.810]  Alfredo Griffin.
[25:00.070 --> 25:00.510]  Oh, that's Fed.
[25:01.210 --> 25:01.650]  Alfredo!
[25:01.750 --> 25:02.150]  Yeah, you're right.
[25:02.190 --> 25:02.670]  Alfredo Griffin.
[25:02.830 --> 25:03.050]  That's Fed.
[25:03.990 --> 25:05.970]  That was a lot more shattery than I was expecting.
[25:06.090 --> 25:06.850]  Richie Ashburn.
[25:06.990 --> 25:08.010]  Ellis Burks.
[25:08.130 --> 25:09.330]  Paul O'Neill.
[25:09.850 --> 25:10.290]  Oh!
[25:11.550 --> 25:12.710]  Should we have a sup?
[25:13.250 --> 25:13.770]  Oh, yeah.
[25:13.870 --> 25:14.330]  Like, sup?
[25:14.690 --> 25:15.250]  Like, sup.
[25:15.430 --> 25:16.130]  Or, like, you up?
[25:16.550 --> 25:17.270]  Oh, like, where you at?
[25:17.270 --> 25:18.250]  Because I think...
[25:18.250 --> 25:21.290]  I think Mike Hinneman is the poster boy.
[25:21.610 --> 25:21.830]  Oh.
[25:21.950 --> 25:22.490]  Pussy sleigh.
[25:22.750 --> 25:22.990]  Yeah.
[25:22.990 --> 25:23.930]  Yeah, that's what he's thinking.
[25:24.050 --> 25:24.370]  Yeah.
[25:24.510 --> 25:24.950]  What are you doing later?
[25:25.070 --> 25:26.650]  He's like, I got that big D for you.
[25:26.790 --> 25:27.630]  Hey, Mike, what are you doing later?
[25:28.230 --> 25:28.390]  Oh.
[25:28.810 --> 25:29.310]  Pussy sleigh.
[25:29.550 --> 25:29.830]  Figures.
[25:29.990 --> 25:30.210]  Yeah.
[25:30.330 --> 25:31.330]  Yeah, I'm gonna set that over there.
[25:31.530 --> 25:31.890]  That's a good one.
[25:31.950 --> 25:32.950]  Dude, I think this could just be pussy sleigh.
[25:32.990 --> 25:33.950]  Bobby Thigpen.
[25:35.190 --> 25:35.830]  Tim Leary.
[25:36.650 --> 25:37.290]  Timothy Leary.
[25:37.570 --> 25:38.450]  Yeah, unsafe at any speed.
[25:39.710 --> 25:40.350]  Dion James.
[25:41.910 --> 25:42.570]  I also got this.
[25:44.190 --> 25:45.550]  I have no idea what the hell that is.
[25:46.490 --> 25:47.510]  Major League Baseball.
[25:47.650 --> 25:48.470]  58 cents.
[25:49.250 --> 25:49.570]  Free...
[25:49.570 --> 25:50.250]  Should we open it up?
[25:50.370 --> 25:50.670]  Yeah.
[25:50.810 --> 25:50.990]  Sure.
[25:50.990 --> 25:53.530]  Is it just like every White Sox player from that year?
[25:53.810 --> 25:53.910]  What?
[25:54.010 --> 25:54.830]  I don't even know what year it is.
[25:54.850 --> 25:55.770]  It doesn't say, does it?
[25:56.670 --> 25:58.270]  It says Chicago White Sox on the side.
[25:59.370 --> 26:02.230]  1990 Chicago White Sox card collector box.
[26:03.790 --> 26:05.190]  I can't believe...
[26:05.190 --> 26:08.270]  So what would you have done with these cards if we hadn't had that conversation that day?
[26:08.330 --> 26:12.110]  Would they just sit there until your parents, your mom dies someday and you have to clean that thing out?
[26:12.130 --> 26:14.290]  I've been begging her for years to throw this all away.
[26:14.430 --> 26:14.790]  Oh, okay.
[26:14.890 --> 26:15.790]  So she's been holding on to it.
[26:15.790 --> 26:16.650]  She's been holding on to it.
[26:16.690 --> 26:18.310]  And I hate to admit that she was right.
[26:19.130 --> 26:20.730]  There was going to be a use for these.
[26:21.070 --> 26:23.430]  And streaming on the internet was not what I pictured when I was 12.
[26:24.010 --> 26:25.430]  Oh my God, Gus.
[26:25.570 --> 26:25.730]  What is that?
[26:26.290 --> 26:26.630]  Ew!
[26:26.830 --> 26:28.050]  Ew, is it gum?
[26:28.190 --> 26:28.970]  I think it's gum.
[26:30.110 --> 26:31.390]  It's the box.
[26:32.370 --> 26:36.490]  And then you put your teams in it, but it comes with gum.
[26:36.570 --> 26:40.150]  Or those sleeves that have all melted together.
[26:40.230 --> 26:40.970]  What is that?
[26:41.050 --> 26:41.350]  It's gum.
[26:42.010 --> 26:42.150]  Yeah.
[26:42.310 --> 26:42.990]  It's gum?
[26:43.090 --> 26:43.250]  Yeah.
[26:43.950 --> 26:44.170]  Right?
[26:45.230 --> 26:45.770]  That's gum.
[26:45.850 --> 26:46.930]  It tastes better than the other stuff.
[26:46.930 --> 26:47.650]  Try it.
[26:47.830 --> 26:48.350]  This isn't bad.
[26:48.510 --> 26:50.030]  Break me off of these.
[26:50.250 --> 26:51.370]  It actually still has flavor.
[26:52.390 --> 26:53.450]  She said that.
[26:54.910 --> 26:55.610]  Thanks, man.
[26:55.950 --> 26:56.350]  Thanks.
[26:57.450 --> 26:59.850]  It's like salmon treats you give cats.
[27:05.710 --> 27:07.350]  It doesn't have a flavor.
[27:07.770 --> 27:08.350]  Not a good one.
[27:08.430 --> 27:09.630]  Let's try one of these night...
[27:09.630 --> 27:11.050]  That's hideous.
[27:11.610 --> 27:15.050]  Let's try one of these hanger things of nighty moments.
[27:15.310 --> 27:16.290]  These things are fun.
[27:17.110 --> 27:17.570]  Oh, man.
[27:17.670 --> 27:19.530]  I wish I hadn't put that in my mouth.
[27:19.690 --> 27:20.510]  Did you spit it in here?
[27:20.850 --> 27:21.750]  No, I spit it out already.
[27:21.910 --> 27:26.030]  It's one of those things where the aftertaste lingers.
[27:26.210 --> 27:27.810]  I can't get enough of it out of my mouth.
[27:27.930 --> 27:28.530]  It's still there.
[27:28.670 --> 27:33.350]  I put the smallest amount on Earth in my mouth, and it left the biggest aftertaste.
[27:36.310 --> 27:38.150]  We chew this gum, so you don't have to.
[27:38.330 --> 27:38.930]  Please don't.
[27:38.930 --> 27:39.650]  Please don't chew that gum.
[27:40.350 --> 27:40.910]  Oh, here we go.
[27:40.950 --> 27:41.370]  This is cool.
[27:41.510 --> 27:42.290]  It's a picture card.
[27:42.370 --> 27:43.350]  This is 90 Bowman.
[27:44.230 --> 27:44.550]  That's...
[27:45.650 --> 27:46.570]  Fuck if I know.
[27:47.210 --> 27:47.250]  Cute.
[27:48.030 --> 27:48.470]  Okay.
[27:49.330 --> 27:50.450]  Oh, Tom Glavin.
[27:51.370 --> 27:52.670]  That might be worth something.
[27:52.970 --> 27:54.770]  Sounds like something a professional freak would say.
[27:55.370 --> 27:56.530]  Put that in there.
[27:56.710 --> 27:58.890]  How about if I just Google that instead of...
[27:58.890 --> 27:59.590]  Tim Raines.
[27:59.670 --> 28:00.390]  Rock Raines.
[28:01.490 --> 28:05.010]  Do we have a need for a rock nickname?
[28:05.190 --> 28:05.830]  Rock or not rock.
[28:06.030 --> 28:06.590]  Rock's not rock.
[28:07.090 --> 28:07.850]  Rock's not rock.
[28:08.050 --> 28:09.050]  We'll have that list.
[28:09.190 --> 28:09.950]  All right, there's Tim Raines.
[28:09.950 --> 28:10.950]  I did...
[28:13.750 --> 28:14.790]  Ernie Camacho.
[28:17.090 --> 28:18.830]  I have an uncle who looked like that.
[28:19.430 --> 28:20.090]  John Franco.
[28:20.170 --> 28:20.890]  I wasn't going to say shit.
[28:21.710 --> 28:24.650]  Oh, Craig Biggio.
[28:25.930 --> 28:27.190]  Is that his rookie card?
[28:27.210 --> 28:28.590]  Yeah, that probably is his rookie card.
[28:29.030 --> 28:30.770]  Darryl Strawberry, the man.
[28:31.030 --> 28:31.590]  Set that aside.
[28:32.090 --> 28:32.810]  Sammy Sosa.
[28:32.990 --> 28:33.870]  We'll set that aside.
[28:34.390 --> 28:34.990]  Al Newman.
[28:35.590 --> 28:36.050]  Nick Osaski.
[28:37.510 --> 28:38.550]  Steve Ontiveros.
[28:38.850 --> 28:39.890]  Sid Fernandez.
[28:40.710 --> 28:41.510]  Randy Bush.
[28:41.590 --> 28:42.630]  Put that in the body parts.
[28:42.910 --> 28:43.410]  Oh, yeah.
[28:43.510 --> 28:44.030]  Dave Martinez.
[28:45.850 --> 28:46.650]  Geoff Russell.
[28:46.970 --> 28:47.970]  Darren Lewis.
[28:49.910 --> 28:50.510]  You know...
[28:50.510 --> 28:51.550]  I think we have another...
[28:51.550 --> 28:52.810]  You want to hit the oh boy for me?
[28:52.830 --> 28:53.270]  Oh, hold on.
[28:53.970 --> 28:54.270]  Yeah.
[28:54.510 --> 28:55.470]  Oh, boy!
[28:57.950 --> 28:58.550]  Oh, yeah.
[28:59.630 --> 29:01.170]  He's just like...
[29:04.510 --> 29:06.370]  He's like, you're going to do pussy slay?
[29:11.550 --> 29:14.330]  That's him talking to Mike Herman or whatever his name is.
[29:14.350 --> 29:14.810]  Mike Boniker.
[29:15.150 --> 29:15.950]  Wayne Edwards.
[29:17.610 --> 29:18.650]  Darryl Kyle.
[29:19.430 --> 29:20.350]  Bo Jackson!
[29:21.470 --> 29:22.310]  That's worth money.
[29:22.690 --> 29:23.610]  We're going to put that aside.
[29:24.070 --> 29:24.630]  Derek Lilliquist.
[29:24.650 --> 29:25.790]  I'm going to go to my college fund.
[29:25.930 --> 29:27.010]  Wally Joyner.
[29:27.270 --> 29:27.750]  Looks like...
[29:27.750 --> 29:29.850]  Wally Joyner is like an onomatopoeia.
[29:30.190 --> 29:32.110]  Wally looks like a Wally and...
[29:32.110 --> 29:34.670]  I feel like what that looks like is what Wally sounds like.
[29:34.770 --> 29:34.970]  Okay.
[29:35.450 --> 29:36.010]  Wally Joyner.
[29:36.670 --> 29:37.570]  Wally Joyner.
[29:37.710 --> 29:38.730]  Tom Bernanski.
[29:39.430 --> 29:40.230]  Dan Pascua.
[29:40.550 --> 29:41.450]  Sid Bream.
[29:41.990 --> 29:42.890]  That's a fish.
[29:44.150 --> 29:44.790]  A bream.
[29:44.930 --> 29:45.350]  Oh, yeah.
[29:45.570 --> 29:46.090]  Like sea bream.
[29:46.150 --> 29:46.530]  Sea bream.
[29:48.010 --> 29:48.810]  Chris Hoyles.
[29:49.450 --> 29:50.730]  Pull that John Franco aside.
[29:51.110 --> 29:52.170]  Oh, did I have a John Franco in here?
[29:52.910 --> 29:54.050]  You know, I'm looking at...
[29:54.050 --> 29:56.430]  When I was looking at the Sammy Sosa card...
[29:56.430 --> 29:56.650]  Yeah.
[29:57.550 --> 29:58.730]  He doesn't look like that anymore.
[29:59.810 --> 30:00.210]  No!
[30:00.470 --> 30:01.890]  No, no, no, no.
[30:01.910 --> 30:02.350]  Is he okay?
[30:02.490 --> 30:02.630]  Is he okay?
[30:02.850 --> 30:03.850]  Pull the John Franco aside.
[30:04.010 --> 30:05.210]  He doesn't look like that anymore.
[30:06.070 --> 30:06.750]  No, he's got...
[30:06.750 --> 30:11.510]  Well, he got a little bit older and, you know, ravages of a lifetime of steroids.
[30:11.710 --> 30:12.110]  Oh.
[30:12.750 --> 30:13.550]  Nelson Liriano.
[30:14.690 --> 30:15.490]  Kevin Wickander.
[30:17.390 --> 30:17.790]  No...
[30:17.790 --> 30:20.170]  To my knowledge, no relationship to Alicia Wickander.
[30:20.350 --> 30:20.670]  Oh, no.
[30:20.890 --> 30:21.090]  Yeah.
[30:23.290 --> 30:24.090]  Roberto Alomar.
[30:24.230 --> 30:25.110]  That might be...
[30:25.110 --> 30:26.870]  If that's his rookie card, that might have some...
[30:28.110 --> 30:31.950]  Oh, someone pointed out that AnimeLady501 says Daryl Strawberry is also food.
[30:32.610 --> 30:33.290]  Oh, did we pass that?
[30:33.290 --> 30:33.950]  Daryl Strawberry is...
[30:33.950 --> 30:34.770]  He's a little...
[30:34.770 --> 30:35.150]  Oh, okay.
[30:35.670 --> 30:36.910]  Thank you for that, by the way.
[30:36.970 --> 30:37.750]  You're right.
[30:38.450 --> 30:39.250]  Yvonne Calderon.
[30:39.870 --> 30:40.570]  He was good.
[30:40.870 --> 30:41.570]  Lee Stevens.
[30:41.690 --> 30:42.710]  Marty Barrett.
[30:42.810 --> 30:43.250]  Danny Heap.
[30:43.350 --> 30:44.230]  Gus is already checking his watch.
[30:44.530 --> 30:45.050]  No, no, no.
[30:45.650 --> 30:45.950]  Wow.
[30:46.810 --> 30:47.410]  Why Evans?
[30:47.590 --> 30:48.390]  Right over there.
[30:48.870 --> 30:50.390]  Dude, those fucking Bowmans are hot.
[30:50.490 --> 30:51.250]  Let's open up some of these.
[30:52.210 --> 30:56.730]  These Donruss, this is 1990 Donruss, were some of the easiest cards to mar.
[30:57.230 --> 30:57.830]  What's mar?
[30:58.010 --> 30:58.990]  Like, fuck up.
[30:59.450 --> 30:59.650]  Oh.
[30:59.810 --> 31:00.310]  Like, mar.
[31:02.150 --> 31:02.870]  Like, misprint?
[31:02.870 --> 31:03.790]  Like, in the production?
[31:03.790 --> 31:04.910]  Or, like, once you owned them?
[31:04.930 --> 31:05.470]  Like, once you owned them.
[31:05.510 --> 31:07.150]  They're just very delicate and they're easy to fuck up.
[31:07.290 --> 31:07.850]  What's a good thing?
[31:07.890 --> 31:09.610]  They've been sitting in a suitcase for 30 years.
[31:12.230 --> 31:12.870]  Mitch Williams.
[31:13.430 --> 31:13.870]  Gary Ward.
[31:13.930 --> 31:15.390]  These aren't surprisingly great.
[31:15.590 --> 31:16.770]  Well, these are fucked.
[31:17.910 --> 31:18.310]  That's a print.
[31:19.410 --> 31:20.970]  Oh, Randy Johnson, 89.
[31:21.130 --> 31:21.330]  Is that?
[31:21.370 --> 31:22.210]  That's probably okay.
[31:22.650 --> 31:23.250]  Chili Davis.
[31:23.510 --> 31:23.610]  That's food.
[31:23.610 --> 31:23.970]  Oh, dude.
[31:24.130 --> 31:26.330]  I haven't thought about Chili Davis in forever.
[31:26.690 --> 31:28.010]  What do you know about Chili Davis?
[31:28.850 --> 31:30.190]  I don't remember much.
[31:30.290 --> 31:30.910]  I do remember watching...
[31:31.650 --> 31:33.630]  I used to watch baseball.
[31:33.630 --> 31:34.750]  All the time when I was a kid.
[31:34.830 --> 31:35.270]  I remember...
[31:35.270 --> 31:35.770]  Who was your favorite team?
[31:36.290 --> 31:36.530]  My favorite...
[31:36.530 --> 31:37.450]  I was a big Astros fan.
[31:38.130 --> 31:38.850]  Derek Lilliquist.
[31:39.130 --> 31:40.230]  Mark Grace, 89.
[31:40.690 --> 31:41.050]  That's...
[31:41.050 --> 31:41.350]  Or, 90.
[31:41.550 --> 31:42.610]  That's probably not worth anything.
[31:43.710 --> 31:44.430]  Greg Litton.
[31:44.650 --> 31:45.470]  Dennis Akersley.
[31:45.910 --> 31:47.610]  He was one of the best closers of the 80s...
[31:47.610 --> 31:48.070]  Of the 90s.
[31:48.150 --> 31:49.050]  Kirby Puckett.
[31:49.670 --> 31:50.390]  Dave Stortman.
[31:50.650 --> 31:50.790]  All-star.
[31:50.950 --> 31:52.050]  We were.
[31:52.330 --> 31:53.630]  I don't know if we...
[31:54.770 --> 31:56.290]  No, he's too deep into his career.
[31:56.630 --> 31:57.370]  Mike Bielecki.
[31:57.490 --> 31:58.290]  Hobby Brooks.
[31:58.570 --> 31:58.910]  Okay.
[32:00.910 --> 32:02.230]  Those are the ones you want to save?
[32:02.230 --> 32:04.650]  Do you want to look at the ones that aren't sleeved up?
[32:04.850 --> 32:06.830]  And see if you can find any values on them?
[32:06.930 --> 32:08.770]  Yeah, I used to watch baseball like crazy.
[32:08.850 --> 32:10.830]  I was really into baseball up until the strike of 94.
[32:11.190 --> 32:12.130]  That's when I stopped watching.
[32:12.330 --> 32:12.370]  Yeah.
[32:12.650 --> 32:15.330]  I was like 16 by that point.
[32:15.630 --> 32:15.890]  I don't know.
[32:15.910 --> 32:17.330]  I just kind of fell out of it.
[32:17.630 --> 32:18.290]  Exactly the same.
[32:19.050 --> 32:19.370]  So...
[32:20.150 --> 32:20.470]  This...
[32:20.470 --> 32:20.770]  Oh, wait.
[32:20.830 --> 32:20.970]  No.
[32:21.150 --> 32:21.310]  Okay.
[32:21.770 --> 32:22.530]  Which one is this one?
[32:22.590 --> 32:23.810]  A lot of his cards look the same.
[32:24.650 --> 32:26.690]  This one is not a bird deck.
[32:26.830 --> 32:27.210]  I'm sorry.
[32:28.170 --> 32:29.250]  I'm not good at this stuff.
[32:29.390 --> 32:29.710]  That's okay.
[32:30.230 --> 32:31.190]  I can do it later.
[32:31.550 --> 32:32.070]  No, no.
[32:32.190 --> 32:33.050]  I'm working on it.
[32:33.090 --> 32:33.690]  Pat Combs.
[32:33.770 --> 32:34.510]  BJ Surhoff.
[32:34.570 --> 32:35.470]  Joe Carter.
[32:36.110 --> 32:36.750]  Bip Roberts.
[32:37.790 --> 32:39.190]  I feel like we should do...
[32:39.970 --> 32:42.370]  A Bip is a thing we did in Achievement Hunter.
[32:42.510 --> 32:43.090]  But how do I...
[32:43.090 --> 32:43.970]  What's a Bip?
[32:44.550 --> 32:45.290]  It's to shoot somebody.
[32:46.010 --> 32:46.550]  Pop them in the head.
[32:46.590 --> 32:47.070]  Shoot them in the head.
[32:47.150 --> 32:47.410]  Bip them.
[32:48.150 --> 32:48.790]  David Wells.
[32:49.110 --> 32:49.890]  Dick Schofield.
[32:49.970 --> 32:51.610]  I think we already pulled a Dick Schofield, didn't we?
[32:51.630 --> 32:52.130]  I think we did.
[32:52.550 --> 32:53.190]  For name as a thing.
[32:53.610 --> 32:53.750]  Yeah.
[32:53.830 --> 32:54.550]  Harold Baines.
[32:56.030 --> 32:56.610]  Howard Johnson.
[32:56.730 --> 32:57.410]  Ryan Sandberg.
[32:57.510 --> 32:58.350]  Dave Henderson again.
[32:59.130 --> 32:59.950]  So this one...
[32:59.950 --> 33:00.610]  I think we pulled that one too.
[33:00.630 --> 33:01.530]  If it's an error card...
[33:01.530 --> 33:02.810]  Larry Walker again.
[33:03.690 --> 33:04.710]  Error rookie card?
[33:04.890 --> 33:05.290]  What's this?
[33:05.690 --> 33:06.910]  What would the error be?
[33:08.990 --> 33:09.750]  What does it say?
[33:09.910 --> 33:11.330]  A lot of times they'll...
[33:11.330 --> 33:18.030]  So there was a lot of fake error cards in the 80s and the 90s, like misprints and stuff,
[33:18.090 --> 33:21.410]  that they would say were error cards because they were very in vogue.
[33:21.630 --> 33:21.910]  Okay.
[33:22.150 --> 33:23.950]  So it might not be a true error card.
[33:24.310 --> 33:25.730]  I just didn't know if you knew what the...
[33:25.730 --> 33:26.770]  No, I don't know what the error would be.
[33:26.770 --> 33:27.850]  Kurt Gibson.
[33:28.330 --> 33:29.050]  Kent Merker.
[33:29.330 --> 33:29.910]  Jerome Walton.
[33:29.990 --> 33:30.110]  Yeah.
[33:30.850 --> 33:33.230]  We'll do PSA 10s, what they could be worth.
[33:33.470 --> 33:35.470]  Some of these could be worth a couple hundred bucks.
[33:35.990 --> 33:36.510]  Ernie Riles.
[33:36.590 --> 33:38.550]  It's just hard to get a PSA 10.
[33:38.690 --> 33:39.270]  Ozzy Smith.
[33:39.390 --> 33:39.850]  Gotta love him.
[33:39.990 --> 33:41.150]  Oh man, I met Ozzy Smith once.
[33:41.550 --> 33:42.310]  Are you fucking serious?
[33:42.410 --> 33:45.110]  Yeah, he did a baseball camp in the town I grew up in.
[33:45.350 --> 33:46.030]  Is he from Texas?
[33:46.230 --> 33:47.230]  No, I don't know why he was there.
[33:47.610 --> 33:50.630]  It was like, pay 50 bucks and go play baseball with Ozzy Smith.
[33:50.730 --> 33:51.850]  That would have been so cool.
[33:52.390 --> 33:54.030]  I played second base and he was a shortstop.
[33:54.790 --> 33:56.070]  Did he teach you how to flip?
[33:56.850 --> 33:57.710]  He flipped a lot.
[33:57.770 --> 33:58.850]  He showed us all how to do that.
[33:58.990 --> 33:59.610]  He loved to flip.
[33:59.850 --> 34:00.890]  Like a backflip?
[34:01.070 --> 34:03.150]  Yeah, he would do backflips in games and catch balls that way.
[34:03.290 --> 34:04.470]  Dude, he's the first Savannah Banana.
[34:05.910 --> 34:06.910]  I guess he was.
[34:06.930 --> 34:07.570]  I never thought about that.
[34:07.910 --> 34:08.570]  Jack Armstrong.
[34:08.770 --> 34:11.530]  Eddie Murray had one of the coolest haircuts in baseball at the time.
[34:11.870 --> 34:12.630]  Geoff Hamilton.
[34:13.790 --> 34:14.590]  Billy Spires.
[34:15.750 --> 34:16.550]  Jose Alvarez.
[34:18.010 --> 34:18.810]  Todd Frohwerth.
[34:19.150 --> 34:20.130]  Oh, Will Clark.
[34:20.390 --> 34:20.930]  He was cool.
[34:21.410 --> 34:23.210]  Kirby Puckett.
[34:23.650 --> 34:24.550]  Frank Viola.
[34:25.470 --> 34:26.810]  Should we do a...
[34:26.810 --> 34:27.770]  An instrument?
[34:28.010 --> 34:29.130]  Yeah, we have a band, I think.
[34:29.250 --> 34:29.790]  We have a band, that's right.
[34:29.910 --> 34:30.090]  Yeah.
[34:31.270 --> 34:32.230]  Gus Polidor.
[34:32.650 --> 34:33.550]  Jose De Leon.
[34:36.530 --> 34:37.510]  He kind of looks like you.
[34:40.390 --> 34:41.350]  Al Leiter.
[34:41.590 --> 34:42.490]  Dicky Thon.
[34:42.690 --> 34:44.670]  Dude, that's a good one.
[34:44.750 --> 34:45.090]  Dickathon?
[34:45.790 --> 34:47.530]  Is that also body part?
[34:47.730 --> 34:48.210]  It's Dickathon.
[34:48.730 --> 34:49.450]  Dick and Dicky.
[34:49.730 --> 34:52.690]  That could go for a name as a body part or...
[34:52.690 --> 34:53.930]  I think that goes with Pussy Slayers.
[34:53.970 --> 34:54.390]  Dickathon.
[34:55.130 --> 34:55.810]  Dicky Thon.
[34:56.670 --> 34:57.950]  You up for a little Dicky Thon?
[34:59.470 --> 35:00.510]  Oh my God.
[35:00.770 --> 35:01.710]  Brooke Jacoby.
[35:02.050 --> 35:03.090]  Frank Williams.
[35:03.470 --> 35:04.330]  Hey, Keith Hernandez.
[35:05.710 --> 35:08.050]  It was on one of the best Seinfeld episodes.
[35:08.270 --> 35:08.290]  Yeah.
[35:08.670 --> 35:09.910]  And Bob Garrett.
[35:10.010 --> 35:11.330]  Don't offer to help him move.
[35:14.170 --> 35:15.110]  Let's keep going with this.
[35:15.150 --> 35:15.650]  90 Fleer.
[35:15.910 --> 35:16.590]  Oh my God, dude.
[35:16.650 --> 35:17.950]  You can sell packs on...
[35:17.950 --> 35:19.230]  Well, they don't sell for anything, but...
[35:19.930 --> 35:22.590]  They're listed for 44 cents from Walmart, so...
[35:22.590 --> 35:23.330]  It's all profit.
[35:23.510 --> 35:24.990]  If you could get that price for them now, you'd be set.
[35:25.310 --> 35:26.690]  Joe McGrane.
[35:27.010 --> 35:27.450]  Checklist.
[35:28.110 --> 35:29.070]  Benny DeStefano.
[35:29.270 --> 35:29.970]  Dennis Powell.
[35:30.090 --> 35:30.810]  Jose Aquindo.
[35:31.170 --> 35:31.530]  Jody Reid.
[35:31.810 --> 35:36.430]  What we want here for realsies, though, for you, Gus, is we want to find you some King
[35:36.430 --> 35:37.010]  Griffey Jr.'s.
[35:37.010 --> 35:37.610]  Greg Walker.
[35:38.150 --> 35:38.950]  Scott Scudder.
[35:39.330 --> 35:40.030]  Damasco Garcia.
[35:41.290 --> 35:41.670]  Boom!
[35:43.670 --> 35:45.350]  You literally just said it!
[35:45.830 --> 35:47.930]  This card in a PSA 10...
[35:47.930 --> 35:48.450]  Oh boy.
[35:48.470 --> 35:49.350]  You manifested it.
[35:49.370 --> 35:49.730]  I did.
[35:49.990 --> 35:51.590]  This card...
[35:51.590 --> 35:54.650]  PSA 10 is worth, Gus...
[36:00.370 --> 36:00.970]  Approximately...
[36:02.050 --> 36:03.170]  Yep, about that.
[36:03.310 --> 36:04.730]  It's worth approximately...
[36:05.470 --> 36:05.790]  $45.
[36:06.250 --> 36:06.650]  Oh.
[36:07.030 --> 36:07.590]  There you go.
[36:07.990 --> 36:08.790]  Oh, sorry.
[36:09.090 --> 36:09.810]  $45, not bad.
[36:11.530 --> 36:12.490]  Brett Butler.
[36:12.830 --> 36:13.670]  Steve Searcy.
[36:13.850 --> 36:15.350]  Isn't Brett Butler a comedian?
[36:16.490 --> 36:17.810]  It was a female comedian.
[36:18.690 --> 36:19.230]  Rhett Butler.
[36:19.350 --> 36:19.870]  Rhett Butler.
[36:20.210 --> 36:21.090]  Yeah, I think that was her name.
[36:21.510 --> 36:22.470]  Maybe it was Brett.
[36:22.470 --> 36:23.090]  I think it was Brett.
[36:23.370 --> 36:24.310]  Aurel Hershiser.
[36:24.750 --> 36:25.310]  Did she have a show on ABC?
[36:25.570 --> 36:26.390]  Dave Smit.
[36:26.570 --> 36:26.990]  Kevin Bass.
[36:26.990 --> 36:27.510]  Did she?
[36:27.670 --> 36:27.790]  Was it Grace Under Fire?
[36:28.170 --> 36:28.470]  Yeah.
[36:28.550 --> 36:29.110]  Was it?
[36:29.190 --> 36:30.670]  Oh my God!
[36:31.210 --> 36:33.050]  How did you know that?
[36:33.070 --> 36:34.190]  Donna liked that show.
[36:34.390 --> 36:35.310]  It was a good show.
[36:35.390 --> 36:37.050]  I've got my windshield replaced.
[36:37.390 --> 36:38.570]  By Brett Butler?
[36:38.930 --> 36:40.490]  I've replaced a few...
[36:40.490 --> 36:41.930]  It was Brett Butler.
[36:42.190 --> 36:42.370]  Yeah.
[36:42.490 --> 36:46.450]  A few months ago, I had worked on it when I was at the waiting room of the place.
[36:46.710 --> 36:49.010]  Grace Under Fire was playing on an old CRT.
[36:49.030 --> 36:49.050]  What?
[36:49.250 --> 36:51.070]  I was like, I haven't thought about that show in forever.
[36:51.070 --> 36:53.450]  That's the only reason I remember Brett Butler right now.
[36:54.870 --> 36:55.670]  Terry Leach.
[36:55.770 --> 36:56.430]  Jodie Reid.
[36:56.450 --> 36:57.530]  Biggie DiStefano.
[36:57.710 --> 36:58.970]  Shane Raleigh.
[36:59.930 --> 37:01.210]  No, just put him in a sleeve.
[37:01.330 --> 37:02.250]  He's fine just in a sleeve.
[37:02.910 --> 37:03.630]  Chuck Finley.
[37:03.790 --> 37:04.290]  Dave Schmidt.
[37:04.390 --> 37:05.190]  Another Griffey Jr.
[37:05.790 --> 37:06.790]  Oh, 90 bucks.
[37:07.170 --> 37:07.430]  Damn!
[37:08.190 --> 37:09.690]  I'm almost positive on this investment.
[37:09.950 --> 37:13.190]  If you wanted to get some of these graded...
[37:13.190 --> 37:16.150]  God damn, Gus, that might...
[37:16.590 --> 37:17.410]  Is it pretty centered?
[37:18.150 --> 37:19.310]  Oh yeah, it's definitely centered.
[37:19.990 --> 37:20.950]  Centered on the back.
[37:21.290 --> 37:22.930]  Top to bottom is pretty good.
[37:23.050 --> 37:23.470]  Corners are good.
[37:23.830 --> 37:24.810]  Gus, you might have...
[37:24.810 --> 37:26.410]  This could be a PSA 10.
[37:26.550 --> 37:27.890]  $45 in the bank-a-roonie.
[37:28.150 --> 37:29.890]  Yeah, and it actually might be worth more than that now.
[37:30.270 --> 37:31.610]  That's as of that time published.
[37:31.870 --> 37:35.230]  There has been a little bit of movement and some junk wax.
[37:36.870 --> 37:38.050]  Could be more in all this.
[37:38.330 --> 37:39.270]  Oh, there's...
[37:39.270 --> 37:40.110]  There's gotta be some...
[37:40.110 --> 37:41.090]  There's probably 50 in there.
[37:41.190 --> 37:42.610]  I think that's the reason I bought it when I was a kid.
[37:42.690 --> 37:45.610]  I was like, there's gonna be like one card that's worth something.
[37:45.750 --> 37:48.670]  And the odds are through the roof that you have several of them.
[37:48.670 --> 37:58.050]  I think what we really want is probably a Juan Gonzalez 89...
[37:58.050 --> 37:59.670]  I don't have an 89 story.
[38:00.270 --> 38:01.890]  Or 90...
[38:01.890 --> 38:04.530]  I thought I had it open and you navigated away from it.
[38:05.630 --> 38:09.370]  We have the full set of tops. 89 over here.
[38:09.910 --> 38:11.310]  This 90...
[38:11.310 --> 38:14.830]  This 1990 Donruss.
[38:15.010 --> 38:15.430]  This shit?
[38:16.590 --> 38:20.470]  There is a Juan Gonzalez era card in it that's worth $500.
[38:22.370 --> 38:23.510]  So we'll look for that.
[38:23.770 --> 38:25.610]  We'll look for that for a little bit.
[38:25.950 --> 38:27.010]  Do you ever do giveaways?
[38:28.050 --> 38:29.590]  There's another one of those gum packs.
[38:29.670 --> 38:30.530]  You want to send it to a viewer?
[38:30.630 --> 38:31.510]  It's a Detroit Tigers.
[38:31.730 --> 38:33.250]  The thing that was entirely gum.
[38:33.490 --> 38:34.130]  With the old logo.
[38:34.450 --> 38:35.230]  We're gonna give this away.
[38:35.330 --> 38:36.410]  How do we figure out who to give it to?
[38:36.690 --> 38:37.470]  That's an Eric problem.
[38:37.650 --> 38:38.590]  Alright, yeah, we'll give that away.
[38:38.650 --> 38:41.110]  Oh my god, I could hear him screaming and he's nodding in the building.
[38:41.110 --> 38:42.170]  Rick Rochelle.
[38:42.170 --> 38:43.550]  Kevin Ritz.
[38:44.190 --> 38:45.430]  Alfredo Griffin.
[38:46.030 --> 38:47.070]  Again, Ben McDonald.
[38:47.810 --> 38:48.570]  Oh my god.
[38:48.910 --> 38:50.130]  Wait, would McDonald's be food?
[38:50.850 --> 38:52.370]  I heard he had a farm.
[38:52.850 --> 38:53.050]  No.
[38:53.350 --> 38:55.030]  He did.
[38:55.350 --> 38:56.230]  Dave Smith.
[38:56.650 --> 38:57.550]  Mike Moore.
[38:57.810 --> 38:58.910]  Ken Patterson.
[38:59.110 --> 39:00.290]  Roberto Kelly.
[39:00.670 --> 39:01.490]  Dwayne Murphy.
[39:01.830 --> 39:02.650]  Kevin Brown.
[39:03.170 --> 39:03.770]  Smoltzy.
[39:04.390 --> 39:05.430]  That might...
[39:06.110 --> 39:08.110]  Yeah, that might be worth a couple pennies.
[39:09.450 --> 39:10.410]  Wade Boggs.
[39:10.410 --> 39:11.010]  Ken Patterson.
[39:11.530 --> 39:12.330]  Lee Greenwood.
[39:12.570 --> 39:12.910]  Mike Moore.
[39:13.290 --> 39:14.090]  Lee Greenwood.
[39:15.550 --> 39:16.350]  Brad Cullinan.
[39:17.050 --> 39:19.270]  Alright, let's see if we can get that Juan Gonzalez.
[39:20.870 --> 39:21.530]  Eric card.
[39:22.150 --> 39:22.870]  That'd be fucking cool.
[39:22.990 --> 39:24.230]  That's a good idea, AnimeLady501.
[39:24.310 --> 39:25.850]  Everyone tweeted Eric asking him if he won.
[39:26.370 --> 39:27.130]  Oh, that's cool.
[39:28.030 --> 39:28.830]  He'll get mad.
[39:29.490 --> 39:31.750]  If you do that, he will ban you.
[39:32.010 --> 39:32.610]  He will block you.
[39:32.730 --> 39:33.510]  He loves to block.
[39:33.670 --> 39:34.290]  He loves to block.
[39:34.570 --> 39:35.210]  Just be aware.
[39:36.790 --> 39:40.690]  And you will not get the Detroit Tigers gum.
[39:40.950 --> 39:41.850]  Well, Rick Ruchell.
[39:42.370 --> 39:43.690]  And there you go, right here, Bo Jackson.
[39:43.870 --> 39:45.490]  I think that's probably worth a little bit.
[39:45.570 --> 39:46.790]  Let's look that up real fast.
[39:47.570 --> 39:50.210]  For that Bo Jackson, we're talking...
[39:52.090 --> 39:53.810]  PSA 10, graded out.
[39:53.910 --> 39:54.370]  100 bucks.
[39:54.750 --> 39:55.150]  Wow.
[39:55.470 --> 39:57.410]  Look, there's your whole collection in one.
[39:58.750 --> 39:59.590]  Looks in decent shape.
[40:00.910 --> 40:03.550]  It's off-center a tad, but that might not be a problem.
[40:04.750 --> 40:06.550]  Because these were in climate-controlled...
[40:07.270 --> 40:08.430]  I'm assuming a climate-controlled...
[40:08.430 --> 40:09.330]  Yeah, it's a climate-controlled storage.
[40:09.370 --> 40:11.010]  They're in remarkably good shape.
[40:11.310 --> 40:13.590]  I mean, dumping them out on the table probably fucked a lot of them up.
[40:14.410 --> 40:15.410]  It's good for the band.
[40:15.430 --> 40:22.050]  Nick Saski, Harold Baines, Chris Bozio, Danny Jackson, Kevin Seitzer,
[40:23.650 --> 40:25.770]  Les Lancaster, Chili Davis again.
[40:25.970 --> 40:26.190]  Food.
[40:26.470 --> 40:27.690]  Yeah, we'll put him in the food pile.
[40:28.310 --> 40:29.030]  Brian Holton.
[40:29.050 --> 40:30.130]  You got one bean, one no bean.
[40:30.130 --> 40:37.250]  Mike Smithson, Lee Mazzilli, Glenn Davis, Walter Weiss, Walter Terrell.
[40:37.950 --> 40:38.830]  Two Walts in a row.
[40:39.230 --> 40:40.530]  Mickey Thornton, Gary Wayne.
[40:41.130 --> 40:41.570]  Gary...
[40:41.570 --> 40:45.130]  Wasn't that the name of the preacher in The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt?
[40:45.670 --> 40:46.830]  Reverend Gary Wayne Gary.
[40:47.010 --> 40:48.190]  I think I only watched the first episode.
[40:48.310 --> 40:49.050]  I didn't watch the rest of it.
[40:49.190 --> 40:49.610]  It was good.
[40:49.830 --> 40:51.030]  John Hamm, I think, was the preacher.
[40:51.030 --> 40:52.170]  This box is so good.
[40:52.770 --> 40:55.590]  The face of the tiger is just...
[40:55.590 --> 40:56.730]  He's a surprise.
[40:59.210 --> 40:59.970]  He's shocked.
[41:00.050 --> 41:01.490]  I mean, that's like...
[41:01.490 --> 41:02.750]  You can't beat that.
[41:03.290 --> 41:05.010]  He's like, we're never going to win again.
[41:05.250 --> 41:08.390]  That's what that tiger looks like on the rare occasions when they win a game.
[41:08.530 --> 41:09.170]  He's like, what happened?
[41:10.510 --> 41:11.390]  Gary Sheffield.
[41:11.510 --> 41:12.170]  Let's set that aside.
[41:12.230 --> 41:13.730]  That might have a small amount of value.
[41:14.130 --> 41:21.090]  Mark Lemke, Todd Frohwerth, Brian Holton, George Bell.
[41:21.550 --> 41:22.990]  Love the way he's wearing his hat.
[41:23.250 --> 41:24.010]  That's fucking cool.
[41:24.290 --> 41:26.390]  It almost looks like it's photoshopped on.
[41:27.350 --> 41:28.690]  Like he changed teams?
[41:29.570 --> 41:30.670]  He wasn't wearing a hat.
[41:30.750 --> 41:32.070]  They're like, we need to put a hat on him.
[41:32.070 --> 41:33.670]  Look, his hair is on the side.
[41:34.610 --> 41:35.410]  Early photoshop?
[41:35.570 --> 41:35.950]  Question mark?
[41:36.050 --> 41:41.270]  It's like they cut the hat out of another photo, taped it on top of that photo.
[41:41.890 --> 41:45.110]  I can't imagine this Carl Eustremski card is worth anything.
[41:45.270 --> 41:46.150]  So we'll leave it in there.
[41:46.350 --> 41:47.610]  Craig Brock, Terry Pendleton.
[41:48.390 --> 41:50.390]  Carl Eustremski with the big sideburns.
[41:51.890 --> 41:52.650]  Ricky Jordan.
[41:52.670 --> 41:53.370]  My wife has that card.
[41:53.590 --> 41:54.250]  Gus is on it.
[41:55.570 --> 41:56.210]  Bud Black.
[41:56.470 --> 41:59.110]  I wanted to get a... there's a couple of them out there.
[42:01.010 --> 42:01.650]  Dave Bergman.
[42:03.310 --> 42:03.950]  Keith Miller.
[42:04.130 --> 42:04.730]  Randy Velarde.
[42:04.930 --> 42:07.490]  There is a... what's his name?
[42:07.690 --> 42:08.010]  Duffman?
[42:08.230 --> 42:09.810]  A card you can get that's worth like 100 bucks.
[42:11.010 --> 42:11.650]  Chris Carpenter.
[42:12.670 --> 42:13.310]  Roberto Alomar.
[42:13.590 --> 42:16.330]  That might have a small amount of value too.
[42:16.930 --> 42:17.950]  Let's go with these for a while.
[42:17.970 --> 42:19.630]  I want to see if we can find one of these Juan Gonzalez era cards.
[42:19.690 --> 42:21.410]  I know we can't, but you never know.
[42:21.610 --> 42:23.130]  Come on, there's got to be one in here somewhere.
[42:23.130 --> 42:24.970]  There's no reason why we couldn't find one.
[42:24.970 --> 42:25.250]  We've got so many.
[42:27.530 --> 42:30.970]  Are the M's the Mariners that Ken Griffey Jr. played for?
[42:30.970 --> 42:32.570]  Yeah, he was a Seattle Mariner.
[42:32.610 --> 42:33.510]  Was he always that?
[42:33.610 --> 42:34.950]  No, eventually he played for the Reds.
[42:36.110 --> 42:36.590]  Allen Anderson.
[42:37.390 --> 42:38.190]  Carlos Martinez.
[42:39.030 --> 42:39.830]  Mark Williamson.
[42:39.970 --> 42:41.650]  Eric Anthony, Rated Rookie, not worth anything.
[42:41.770 --> 42:42.230]  Harold Baines.
[42:42.970 --> 42:44.770]  Dave Stewart, Diamond Kings, not worth anything.
[42:44.910 --> 42:46.690]  Fernando Valenzuela, hell of a pitcher.
[42:46.750 --> 42:47.290]  Oh yeah, wow.
[42:48.530 --> 42:49.890]  He's using his whole body on that.
[42:51.710 --> 42:52.510]  Terry Brose.
[42:52.510 --> 42:53.450]  Don Robinson.
[42:53.630 --> 42:55.070]  Eric Plunk.
[42:55.930 --> 42:56.950]  Would that be banned?
[42:57.330 --> 42:57.570]  Yeah.
[42:57.690 --> 42:58.550]  Like, I play Plunk.
[43:00.990 --> 43:02.590]  I Plunk the bass.
[43:02.810 --> 43:06.950]  We should get all the Bips and the Plunks together and see if we can build a song out of sounds.
[43:07.150 --> 43:07.650]  I'm like...
[43:07.650 --> 43:08.290]  Plunk.
[43:08.490 --> 43:09.290]  That's a Plunk.
[43:09.570 --> 43:10.410]  Gary Pettis.
[43:10.870 --> 43:11.690]  Mark Davis.
[43:12.690 --> 43:13.670]  Booyah, Bo Jackson.
[43:13.830 --> 43:15.070]  Let's see how much that'll run us.
[43:15.550 --> 43:17.490]  Terry Armas and Kelly Gruber, not worth anything.
[43:17.610 --> 43:20.570]  That Bo Jackson MVP card is worth less than the other one, I'm going to guarantee you.
[43:20.570 --> 43:23.210]  But it's probably still worth...
[43:23.210 --> 43:24.530]  Print way more of that MVP card.
[43:24.670 --> 43:25.470]  Yeah, these are different.
[43:25.750 --> 43:27.170]  I should keep my eye open for...
[43:27.170 --> 43:28.830]  Who is that I should keep my eye open for?
[43:30.230 --> 43:31.190]  Oh, Larry Walker.
[43:31.750 --> 43:32.970]  Yeah, Larry Walker rookie that year.
[43:33.610 --> 43:34.750]  Cal Ripken, of course.
[43:35.230 --> 43:35.770]  I know that...
[43:35.770 --> 43:37.010]  I saw him in here.
[43:37.650 --> 43:40.510]  The gum flavor has evolved into something else in my mouth.
[43:40.630 --> 43:41.490]  I still feel it.
[43:41.510 --> 43:41.930]  That's the poison.
[43:42.050 --> 43:43.290]  The poison stayed with you.
[43:43.470 --> 43:43.730]  Yeah.
[43:44.770 --> 43:46.810]  Let's see what ingredient we think it is.
[43:48.690 --> 43:50.330]  Maybe it's the glycerin?
[43:51.070 --> 43:52.390]  It tastes like glycerin.
[43:52.470 --> 43:52.710]  Yeah.
[43:52.790 --> 43:55.830]  There's sugar and then there's gum base, whatever that is.
[43:56.210 --> 43:57.270]  Corn syrup, glycerin.
[43:57.510 --> 43:59.390]  I'm shocked that there's an ingredients list on there.
[43:59.770 --> 44:00.250]  Lectithin.
[44:00.950 --> 44:02.190]  Artificial flavors and colors.
[44:03.450 --> 44:04.370]  Printed in the USA.
[44:04.510 --> 44:06.530]  Dude, we haven't even made a dent, Gus.
[44:08.030 --> 44:10.050]  We're not going home until they're all done.
[44:10.130 --> 44:13.790]  We're going to have to bring you on for recurring segments where we just have Gus episodes.
[44:14.310 --> 44:17.130]  Like a crossover between Anma and The Break Show.
[44:18.070 --> 44:20.190]  Because we're... I want to open every one of these.
[44:20.410 --> 44:20.650]  You should do it.
[44:21.790 --> 44:23.450]  Kevin Daniels, but I don't want to open them without you.
[44:23.710 --> 44:24.390]  Rob Dibble.
[44:24.870 --> 44:25.330]  Oh, Dibble.
[44:25.690 --> 44:26.410]  Oh, that's a...
[44:26.410 --> 44:29.470]  I think that's a symptom of chlamydia.
[44:30.390 --> 44:31.450]  She start dibbling.
[44:31.830 --> 44:32.650]  Ted Power.
[44:32.870 --> 44:33.830]  Yvonne Calderon.
[44:33.910 --> 44:34.890]  Is that a... no.
[44:35.790 --> 44:36.750]  Geoff Ballard.
[44:36.890 --> 44:38.350]  Sandy Alomar Jr. rookie.
[44:38.610 --> 44:39.290]  I don't remember that.
[44:40.130 --> 44:41.070]  Chad Cruder.
[44:41.370 --> 44:42.390]  Mark Guthrie.
[44:42.950 --> 44:43.890]  Mike McFarlane.
[44:43.930 --> 44:47.030]  We've been pretty low on steroid players today.
[44:47.030 --> 44:48.150]  We haven't seen any Barry Bonds.
[44:48.370 --> 44:48.770]  Canseco.
[44:48.910 --> 44:49.990]  We haven't seen any Mark McGuire.
[44:50.170 --> 44:50.490]  Sosa.
[44:50.710 --> 44:53.990]  Judging how Sosa looks in these, I think that this is...
[44:53.990 --> 44:55.510]  Is this pre-steroids?
[44:55.530 --> 44:55.790]  Yes.
[44:55.870 --> 44:56.990]  Like they're just going to get in.
[44:57.190 --> 44:58.070]  Yeah, definitely pre-steroids.
[44:58.090 --> 44:59.050]  They're just now starting to...
[44:59.050 --> 45:00.170]  We might see some Mark...
[45:00.170 --> 45:02.070]  Yeah, some Mark McGuires that are like unrecognizable.
[45:02.890 --> 45:07.170]  They are in the process in 1990 of falling in love with steroids.
[45:07.350 --> 45:08.650]  Like they still got it under control.
[45:08.970 --> 45:09.970]  Pablo's just their buddy.
[45:10.250 --> 45:11.610]  You know, hanging out with every now and then.
[45:11.970 --> 45:15.030]  I think it's really like a symptom of post-strike.
[45:15.750 --> 45:16.150]  Post-94.
[45:16.150 --> 45:17.510]  It's really hard to see that explode.
[45:17.710 --> 45:18.030]  Okay.
[45:18.610 --> 45:22.310]  I think baseball fell off and it was like an attempt to become relevant again.
[45:22.350 --> 45:23.730]  They were like, we're going to smash it.
[45:23.730 --> 45:24.610]  We're going to juice up.
[45:24.710 --> 45:26.570]  Yeah, we're going to get fucking ripped.
[45:26.810 --> 45:28.250]  You should, after we find...
[45:28.750 --> 45:30.670]  You know, I'm going to keep all these funny ones that aren't worth anything.
[45:30.830 --> 45:31.370]  I hope you don't mind.
[45:31.630 --> 45:34.670]  But all the ones that are valued, I think you should try to sell.
[45:34.750 --> 45:37.530]  You should open up an eBay store that's like Gus's childhood.
[45:37.870 --> 45:38.330]  Gus's Garage?
[45:38.650 --> 45:39.350]  And Gus's Garage.
[45:39.610 --> 45:40.690]  And I bet you could sell...
[45:40.690 --> 45:43.190]  I bet people would love to buy a piece of Gus's history.
[45:43.190 --> 45:43.990]  Mike Stanton.
[45:45.030 --> 45:45.590]  Glenn Braggs.
[45:45.630 --> 45:46.690]  Pedro Guerrero.
[45:47.810 --> 45:48.370]  Jose Gonzalez.
[45:48.570 --> 45:49.850]  Not Juan Gonzalez, who we're looking for.
[45:49.930 --> 45:50.430]  Barry Larkin.
[45:50.450 --> 45:52.090]  What is in the corners of his mouth?
[45:52.690 --> 45:52.970]  Spittle?
[45:53.550 --> 45:53.750]  Oh.
[45:54.670 --> 45:55.430]  Is it just shadow?
[45:55.670 --> 45:56.470]  I guess it's just shadow.
[45:56.530 --> 45:56.990]  That's like vampire.
[45:56.990 --> 45:57.990]  Yeah, it's got some shadow on it.
[45:58.010 --> 45:58.810]  Yeah, it's a vampire shadow.
[45:59.770 --> 46:00.330]  Barry Larkin.
[46:00.390 --> 46:00.730]  Shane Raleigh.
[46:00.790 --> 46:02.350]  By the way, last week we were talking about...
[46:02.350 --> 46:04.750]  Eric was making fun of the Voyage of the Demeter and a bunch of people were upset.
[46:04.890 --> 46:06.470]  And they were like, you don't understand the history of Dracula.
[46:06.570 --> 46:07.210]  I've read the book.
[46:07.290 --> 46:08.750]  I know what the fucking boat is.
[46:08.810 --> 46:09.530]  I know what was in the movie.
[46:09.590 --> 46:10.950]  We were just making fun of the fact that...
[46:10.950 --> 46:11.890]  I don't know that Eric did.
[46:12.050 --> 46:13.870]  But we were making fun of the fact that it looked like a dumb movie.
[46:13.950 --> 46:15.970]  I don't know what any of those words even are.
[46:16.390 --> 46:18.390]  It's how Dracula got to...
[46:18.390 --> 46:18.770]  Well, anyway.
[46:20.570 --> 46:21.210]  Ron Karkovich.
[46:21.790 --> 46:22.430]  Geoff Ballard.
[46:22.570 --> 46:23.590]  Eric Anthony rookie.
[46:23.870 --> 46:25.070]  Julio Machado rookie.
[46:25.250 --> 46:25.730]  Dave Stewart.
[46:25.810 --> 46:26.250]  Diamond Kings.
[46:26.330 --> 46:26.930]  Fernando Valenzuela.
[46:27.150 --> 46:28.530]  This is like the exact same...
[46:28.530 --> 46:29.130]  Terry Gross.
[46:29.250 --> 46:30.070]  Don Robertson.
[46:31.270 --> 46:31.590]  Bill...
[46:31.590 --> 46:33.430]  Is this the same order of the other ones?
[46:33.450 --> 46:34.130]  Bill Landrum.
[46:34.310 --> 46:34.450]  Walt Carroll.
[46:34.450 --> 46:34.690]  Oh, no.
[46:34.750 --> 46:35.590]  That's a high kick, though.
[46:35.650 --> 46:35.990]  That's a...
[46:35.990 --> 46:36.830]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[46:36.950 --> 46:37.810]  Did we get a good high kick in there?
[46:37.810 --> 46:38.270]  That is...
[46:38.270 --> 46:38.450]  Is that Bill?
[46:38.710 --> 46:39.750]  That is like...
[46:39.750 --> 46:40.970]  That's pretty good.
[46:41.090 --> 46:42.130]  Yeah, that's knees to channels.
[46:42.510 --> 46:43.190]  That's knees to nipples.
[46:43.650 --> 46:44.690]  That's a knees to nipples.
[46:44.950 --> 46:45.970]  He's just like lifting...
[46:45.970 --> 46:47.270]  That's when you're like...
[46:49.210 --> 46:50.510]  I do wanna...
[46:50.510 --> 46:51.050]  They're so...
[46:51.050 --> 46:52.030]  Knees to nipples.
[46:52.170 --> 46:52.750]  That's good.
[46:53.090 --> 46:54.210]  That's what it's gonna be labeled.
[46:54.510 --> 46:54.970]  Knees to nips.
[46:55.050 --> 46:55.510]  Knees to nips.
[46:55.510 --> 46:56.210]  Knee nip.
[47:03.040 --> 47:03.780]  What are you tossing out there?
[47:03.820 --> 47:04.400]  Oh, there's more.
[47:04.560 --> 47:06.180]  The packaging's all wound up in there.
[47:07.140 --> 47:07.560]  All right.
[47:07.680 --> 47:08.520]  Scott Fletcher.
[47:08.760 --> 47:09.740]  Lee Stevens.
[47:10.700 --> 47:11.580]  Alex Trevino.
[47:13.020 --> 47:14.020]  Dan Quisenberry.
[47:14.520 --> 47:15.400]  Is that a food?
[47:16.100 --> 47:16.600]  Quisenberry.
[47:16.720 --> 47:17.340]  I think that's it.
[47:17.360 --> 47:18.620]  Can we consider that a food, please?
[47:18.820 --> 47:19.000]  Yeah.
[47:19.500 --> 47:20.000]  Quisenberry.
[47:21.980 --> 47:22.480]  Captain Crunch with...
[47:22.480 --> 47:23.460]  Oh, the new flavor.
[47:23.680 --> 47:24.180]  Quisenberry.
[47:24.360 --> 47:24.820]  Back to school.
[47:24.820 --> 47:25.820]  Captain Crunch with Quisenberries.
[47:27.440 --> 47:28.240]  Steve Lake.
[47:28.300 --> 47:29.360]  For the makers of Member Berries.
[47:30.060 --> 47:31.040]  Norm Charlton.
[47:31.440 --> 47:32.260]  Dennis Rasmussen.
[47:32.400 --> 47:33.120]  Trevor Wilson.
[47:33.420 --> 47:34.300]  Randy Kramer.
[47:34.460 --> 47:35.580]  Sergio Valdez.
[47:35.920 --> 47:36.580]  Paul Asperger's.
[47:37.420 --> 47:38.080]  Asperger's.
[47:40.300 --> 47:41.650]  Ass and Mocker.
[47:42.560 --> 47:43.000]  Is that the body part?
[47:43.700 --> 47:44.500]  Ass and Mocker?
[47:44.520 --> 47:45.040]  I think it's Ass and Mocker.
[47:45.040 --> 47:47.520]  That's German for asshole.
[47:49.300 --> 47:50.500]  It's German for brown ring.
[47:50.620 --> 47:51.520]  Mark Carrelson.
[47:51.660 --> 47:52.500]  Jay Buhner.
[47:52.780 --> 47:53.800]  Mookie Wilson.
[47:54.300 --> 47:55.420]  And Gene Larkin.
[47:58.100 --> 48:00.460]  I wonder if she'd have an All Rhymes with Dookie team.
[48:00.820 --> 48:01.600]  Mookie Wilson.
[48:02.360 --> 48:03.340]  Mookie Betts.
[48:04.880 --> 48:06.340]  Anybody who's a...
[48:06.340 --> 48:06.560]  Pookie.
[48:06.680 --> 48:07.940]  Rookie that year.
[48:08.140 --> 48:08.240]  Rookie.
[48:08.980 --> 48:09.720]  Mark Grant.
[48:10.300 --> 48:11.600]  Carmen Castillo.
[48:12.200 --> 48:13.340]  Ricky Jordan.
[48:14.660 --> 48:15.660]  Walt Terrell.
[48:16.560 --> 48:17.440]  Mike...
[48:17.440 --> 48:18.580]  Blowers.
[48:20.620 --> 48:22.160]  I hardly knowers.
[48:22.400 --> 48:22.640]  Yeah.
[48:22.860 --> 48:23.820]  Name as a job?
[48:25.860 --> 48:27.440]  Bill Duran.
[48:28.600 --> 48:30.320]  Jose Nunez.
[48:30.420 --> 48:31.440]  Greg Harris.
[48:31.760 --> 48:32.760]  Renee Gonzalez.
[48:32.760 --> 48:34.040]  Vaughn Hager.
[48:34.160 --> 48:35.060]  Mitch Williams.
[48:35.220 --> 48:36.240]  Mark Cubicle.
[48:36.760 --> 48:37.720]  Scott Scudder.
[48:37.940 --> 48:38.840]  Ozzy Guillen.
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.600]  We have to up-sleeve this because he...
[48:40.600 --> 48:41.760]  He was the...
[48:42.720 --> 48:45.920]  Well, he was a great White Sox, but he was also our head coach when we won the...
[48:46.640 --> 48:48.340]  Championship in 2004-2005.
[48:48.400 --> 48:50.560]  Scott Scudder is just directly into the sunlight.
[48:51.100 --> 48:55.740]  Just trying so hard to keep his eyes open, but his face is just like...
[48:55.740 --> 48:56.760]  I feel like...
[48:56.760 --> 48:57.760]  I feel like...
[48:59.080 --> 48:59.960]  Scott Scudder...
[48:59.960 --> 49:02.100]  He deserves to be in a collection.
[49:02.100 --> 49:03.260]  I just don't know which one.
[49:03.280 --> 49:04.120]  Is he not well?
[49:04.200 --> 49:05.200]  Is he a boy?
[49:05.620 --> 49:06.880]  Neither of those.
[49:06.940 --> 49:08.360]  He's just a fucking dork.
[49:08.480 --> 49:10.420]  Neck too long, face too small.
[49:11.120 --> 49:12.920]  Let's just TBD him.
[49:14.100 --> 49:16.000]  We're gonna figure out how to make fun of you later.
[49:16.380 --> 49:18.520]  Nick Asasky and Barry Larkin.
[49:18.580 --> 49:19.780]  We don't know what we're gonna make fun of you for.
[49:19.840 --> 49:20.240]  Probably a lovely guy.
[49:20.260 --> 49:20.820]  We're gonna get that.
[49:21.060 --> 49:21.820]  Probably not.
[49:21.960 --> 49:22.520]  He might be terrible.
[49:23.080 --> 49:23.660]  Is anybody...
[49:23.660 --> 49:24.080]  What's his name?
[49:24.220 --> 49:25.240]  William Scott Scudder.
[49:25.620 --> 49:27.000]  He's from Blossom, Texas.
[49:28.180 --> 49:30.600]  He was born on Valentine's Day.
[49:31.220 --> 49:34.020]  Blossom, Texas might be close enough for him to come down and punch Gus in the face.
[49:34.080 --> 49:34.820]  So, let's be nice.
[49:34.900 --> 49:38.760]  Was voted Texas High School Player of the Year before being drafted by the Reds in 86.
[49:39.140 --> 49:39.720]  Oh, shit.
[49:40.760 --> 49:42.380]  Blossom, Texas is 306 miles away.
[49:43.940 --> 49:46.680]  It's between Reno, Texas and Detroit, Texas.
[49:46.900 --> 49:48.400]  Those are a lot of different states.
[49:49.660 --> 49:50.460]  Jesus Christ.
[49:50.820 --> 49:51.540]  John Kruk.
[49:52.380 --> 49:53.060]  Here we go.
[49:53.380 --> 49:54.060]  Billy Ripken.
[49:54.280 --> 49:56.560]  That's his non-fuckface card, but we'll save that.
[49:56.680 --> 49:58.860]  It's not worth anything, but Billy Ripken we love.
[49:59.120 --> 49:59.960]  Eric Davis.
[49:59.960 --> 50:01.220]  Mickey Sasser.
[50:01.380 --> 50:03.360]  He's the inspiration of this whole fucking thing.
[50:03.380 --> 50:04.260]  Craig Brock.
[50:04.540 --> 50:05.540]  Terry Pendleton.
[50:05.820 --> 50:06.560]  That's a blanket.
[50:08.880 --> 50:10.160]  Dwayne Ward.
[50:11.380 --> 50:12.560]  Ricky Horton.
[50:13.020 --> 50:16.760]  Not to be confused with that place where we get coffee sometimes.
[50:16.900 --> 50:17.680]  Tim Hortons.
[50:17.840 --> 50:18.400]  Up in Michigan.
[50:19.120 --> 50:19.820]  Pete O'Brien.
[50:20.080 --> 50:21.140]  Frank Williams.
[50:21.300 --> 50:23.100]  Keith Hernandez again from Seinfeld.
[50:23.500 --> 50:24.220]  Andy Hawkins.
[50:24.720 --> 50:25.220]  Joe McGrain.
[50:26.840 --> 50:27.980]  Kevin Hickey.
[50:27.980 --> 50:28.560]  That's a...
[50:29.260 --> 50:30.340]  That's like Pussy Slay?
[50:30.580 --> 50:30.700]  Yeah.
[50:31.220 --> 50:31.860]  Willie Frazier.
[50:32.020 --> 50:32.620]  That goes in the...
[50:32.620 --> 50:32.780]  Yeah.
[50:33.020 --> 50:34.240]  That goes in the...
[50:35.200 --> 50:35.840]  Juan Agosta.
[50:36.060 --> 50:36.820]  Is Willie a body part?
[50:38.240 --> 50:38.560]  Yeah.
[50:38.700 --> 50:39.400]  Might as well, right?
[50:39.800 --> 50:41.760]  Keith Hernandez was really good in that role in Seinfeld.
[50:41.960 --> 50:42.200]  He was.
[50:42.280 --> 50:42.560]  He was great.
[50:42.820 --> 50:43.480]  Made for it.
[50:43.700 --> 50:44.620]  Like really...
[50:45.020 --> 50:45.800]  Affable and funny.
[50:45.820 --> 50:46.800]  Well-acted.
[50:48.640 --> 50:50.320]  I'm gonna pull a few more of these out for you over here.
[50:50.460 --> 50:50.960]  Thank you, sir.
[50:51.140 --> 50:51.760]  We got about...
[50:51.760 --> 50:52.140]  Oh, look.
[50:52.160 --> 50:54.820]  It looks like we got nine minutes left, so we're gonna get through as many as we can.
[50:55.000 --> 50:55.580]  We're almost done.
[50:55.680 --> 50:55.940]  I know.
[50:56.000 --> 50:56.520]  It goes so fast.
[50:56.600 --> 50:57.380]  Bill Bathy.
[50:57.580 --> 50:58.440]  Ron Robinson.
[50:58.700 --> 50:59.700]  Sammy Sosa.
[51:02.780 --> 51:03.780]  See what that's worth.
[51:04.820 --> 51:05.600]  Sammy Sosa.
[51:06.260 --> 51:07.520]  I'm still doing it.
[51:10.620 --> 51:11.940]  Squirt in my mouth, Daddy.
[51:12.180 --> 51:12.260]  Fuck.
[51:12.500 --> 51:13.000]  Yeah, that's good.
[51:13.980 --> 51:15.140]  Squirt in his mouth.
[51:17.240 --> 51:21.060]  Sammy Sosa is worth...
[51:21.060 --> 51:21.480]  Let's see.
[51:21.580 --> 51:21.880]  What are they?
[51:23.220 --> 51:23.700]  Ooh.
[51:24.580 --> 51:25.900]  Does it help if I...
[51:25.900 --> 51:25.920]  No.
[51:25.920 --> 51:26.880]  Sing a song.
[51:26.880 --> 51:27.360]  Ooh.
[51:27.840 --> 51:31.100]  What other fun Sammy Sosa facts can you tell me?
[51:31.100 --> 51:32.600]  He's gotta be worth like 50 bucks.
[51:32.820 --> 51:33.820]  Probably about 50 bucks.
[51:33.960 --> 51:34.800]  He got really into steroids.
[51:35.200 --> 51:36.040]  Yeah, he was really into steroids.
[51:36.460 --> 51:36.540]  And he...
[51:36.540 --> 51:37.780]  Really loved Chicago.
[51:38.040 --> 51:38.300]  Okay.
[51:38.540 --> 51:39.620]  I think he still lives there.
[51:39.840 --> 51:40.660]  Is he like...
[51:40.660 --> 51:41.160]  John Smoltz.
[51:41.160 --> 51:43.520]  Was White Sox his most famous team he played for?
[51:44.060 --> 51:44.420]  Yes.
[51:44.420 --> 51:44.500]  Yeah.
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.280]  Oh, here we go.
[51:46.800 --> 51:47.580]  Big time card.
[51:48.080 --> 51:48.380]  Big, big, big time card.
[51:48.380 --> 51:48.860]  Oh, boy.
[51:49.080 --> 51:49.680]  Oh, boy.
[51:49.920 --> 51:50.380]  Oh, boy.
[51:51.120 --> 51:53.640]  This is probably gonna run you, Gus.
[51:53.640 --> 51:59.640]  If this PSA turned out, and it's in honestly good shape, this'll run you...
[52:01.320 --> 52:03.900]  I don't know.
[52:03.940 --> 52:04.500]  50 bucks.
[52:04.520 --> 52:05.290]  Yeah, no shit!
[52:06.000 --> 52:06.160]  Barry Bonds.
[52:06.180 --> 52:07.100]  Yeah, no shit!
[52:07.100 --> 52:07.480]  Stop, sorry.
[52:07.740 --> 52:08.700]  Yeah, about 50 bucks.
[52:08.840 --> 52:09.160]  Wow.
[52:09.180 --> 52:09.780]  First bad boy.
[52:09.980 --> 52:11.020]  You're making money today.
[52:11.260 --> 52:13.020]  That Sosa was...
[52:13.020 --> 52:13.740]  20 maybe?
[52:13.820 --> 52:14.380]  Sosa was 50.
[52:14.620 --> 52:15.100]  Oh, 50, really?
[52:15.400 --> 52:16.460]  Barry Bonds was about 50.
[52:16.600 --> 52:17.160]  So there you go.
[52:17.300 --> 52:18.980]  I think you need a...
[52:18.980 --> 52:19.980]  Danny, I'm telling you.
[52:20.980 --> 52:21.700]  Brian Downing.
[52:21.840 --> 52:22.580]  John Russell.
[52:23.880 --> 52:24.600]  Sid Fernandez.
[52:24.700 --> 52:25.560]  Wally Joyner.
[52:25.740 --> 52:26.680]  Bob Boone.
[52:26.800 --> 52:27.740]  Pedro Guerrero.
[52:27.940 --> 52:28.880]  Raphael Belliard.
[52:29.000 --> 52:29.800]  Steve Sachs.
[52:29.880 --> 52:30.360]  He's in a band.
[52:31.520 --> 52:32.240]  Pete Harnish.
[52:33.240 --> 52:34.360]  Didn't Steve Sachs like hit people?
[52:34.540 --> 52:35.320]  Like throwing the ball?
[52:35.500 --> 52:36.460]  He hit a few guys?
[52:36.700 --> 52:37.400]  I think he did.
[52:37.520 --> 52:38.600]  I think he did like two or three times.
[52:38.800 --> 52:41.060]  He's a color announcer for the Dodgers now, I believe.
[52:41.820 --> 52:42.420]  Or no, I'm sorry.
[52:42.540 --> 52:43.560]  Is it Dodgers or White Sox?
[52:43.820 --> 52:44.400]  Or Cubs?
[52:44.980 --> 52:46.020]  He played for the Dodgers.
[52:46.220 --> 52:46.720]  I think he's Cubs.
[52:46.780 --> 52:47.340]  I think he's a White Sox.
[52:47.480 --> 52:48.300]  Or, I'm sorry.
[52:48.380 --> 52:49.540]  I think he's a Dodgers color announcer.
[52:49.540 --> 52:50.380]  Like sometimes it's him.
[52:50.520 --> 52:51.940]  Sometimes it's Earl Hersheiser.
[52:53.780 --> 52:54.540]  Mike Hinneman.
[52:54.760 --> 52:55.760]  Ricky Henderson.
[52:56.200 --> 52:56.980]  We were looking for that one.
[52:57.300 --> 52:58.400]  Ken Griffey Jr.
[52:58.680 --> 52:59.200]  Look at that.
[53:00.020 --> 53:00.820]  Don Paul.
[53:01.000 --> 53:01.700]  Rick Leach.
[53:02.840 --> 53:03.640]  Nelson Lariano.
[53:03.920 --> 53:04.560]  Tom Foley.
[53:04.620 --> 53:05.220]  Ken Hill.
[53:05.340 --> 53:06.080]  Andy Bennis.
[53:06.320 --> 53:07.360]  Do you have an animal category?
[53:07.520 --> 53:08.380]  Because Leach would go in there.
[53:08.800 --> 53:10.020]  We should have an animal category.
[53:10.180 --> 53:11.220]  We have zoo names.
[53:11.440 --> 53:11.980]  Zoo ones.
[53:12.120 --> 53:12.520]  Yeah, Leach.
[53:12.600 --> 53:12.840]  Rick Leach.
[53:12.860 --> 53:13.520]  Thanks, Gus.
[53:13.720 --> 53:14.860]  I'm trying to go fast.
[53:15.000 --> 53:15.960]  I'm skipping some good stuff.
[53:16.020 --> 53:16.640]  Mike Geoffcoat.
[53:17.120 --> 53:18.100]  Barry Lyons.
[53:18.100 --> 53:19.280]  Kurt Manwaring.
[53:20.560 --> 53:21.400]  Kurt Manwaring.
[53:21.500 --> 53:22.300]  Nick Osaski.
[53:22.480 --> 53:23.560]  Greg Swindell.
[53:23.840 --> 53:24.780]  Bob Walk.
[53:27.260 --> 53:29.500]  You know, he needs to go in the all...
[53:29.500 --> 53:33.180]  I wanted to do a team where it's all things you do in baseball.
[53:33.560 --> 53:33.740]  Okay.
[53:33.980 --> 53:35.520]  So he's in the all baseball team.
[53:36.540 --> 53:37.380]  Mark Thurmond.
[53:37.520 --> 53:38.860]  And then Sean Hilligers.
[53:39.420 --> 53:40.280]  Dude, that Griffey Jr.
[53:41.260 --> 53:42.540]  Let's sit those out.
[53:42.680 --> 53:43.660]  Ricky Henderson, Griffey Jr.
[53:43.780 --> 53:44.660]  Fucking nice right there.
[53:44.760 --> 53:46.340]  Let me see what's going on with those bad boys.
[53:47.620 --> 53:50.500]  Someone said something about the Ken Griffey Jr. where he's kneeling.
[53:50.620 --> 53:51.380]  Someone said something about that.
[53:51.380 --> 53:52.440]  Oh yeah, they did say that, yeah.
[53:52.620 --> 53:54.560]  This is $50, your Ricky Henderson.
[53:55.980 --> 53:56.420]  Approximately.
[53:56.640 --> 53:57.320]  Ricky Henderson was fast.
[53:57.620 --> 54:00.860]  Ricky Henderson was very, very, very fast.
[54:00.860 --> 54:01.820]  Steel bases like crazy.
[54:02.500 --> 54:04.720]  Ricky Henderson also loved Ricky Henderson.
[54:05.020 --> 54:06.040]  And I love that about him.
[54:06.180 --> 54:09.360]  All right, your Griffey Jr. PSA 10 is gonna run you about $275.
[54:09.440 --> 54:09.820]  Wow!
[54:10.400 --> 54:10.840]  Wow!
[54:12.200 --> 54:14.180]  And Gus, I'm gonna be honest with you.
[54:16.340 --> 54:17.300]  It's a nine and a half.
[54:17.380 --> 54:17.900]  It's a nine five.
[54:18.900 --> 54:19.300]  Wow!
[54:19.520 --> 54:20.280]  Probably worth a hundred bucks.
[54:20.400 --> 54:20.760]  Sleeve that.
[54:20.900 --> 54:21.580]  Sleeve both of these.
[54:21.720 --> 54:22.040]  Okay.
[54:22.680 --> 54:24.380]  I have so much happening in front of me.
[54:24.380 --> 54:25.800]  You are swamped.
[54:25.920 --> 54:26.180]  There is like...
[54:26.180 --> 54:26.660]  A whole lot.
[54:27.480 --> 54:28.780]  I feel like Lucy Nethler.
[54:28.980 --> 54:29.480]  I'm just trying to...
[54:29.480 --> 54:30.220]  You're doing so well.
[54:30.220 --> 54:30.980]  Oh my God, Potty Party.
[54:31.600 --> 54:32.220]  Pussy Slay.
[54:32.380 --> 54:33.000]  Rock Not Rock.
[54:34.120 --> 54:34.920]  We're gonna...
[54:34.920 --> 54:35.980]  The Zoo!
[54:36.560 --> 54:38.860]  We're losing like every card off the back of the packs.
[54:38.980 --> 54:39.600]  Pretty much.
[54:39.780 --> 54:40.320]  Are they stuck?
[54:40.380 --> 54:40.600]  Yeah.
[54:40.860 --> 54:45.840]  Brooke Jacoby, Eddie Murray, Dave LaPointe, Mike Greenwell,
[54:45.840 --> 54:46.900]  Chet Lemon.
[54:47.160 --> 54:47.980]  Names of food.
[54:48.180 --> 54:48.540]  Food.
[54:48.720 --> 54:49.020]  I'm sorry.
[54:49.220 --> 54:49.660]  I'm coming.
[54:50.180 --> 54:50.960]  I got another one for you.
[54:51.240 --> 54:52.600]  I don't want to overload you.
[54:52.720 --> 54:53.040]  I'm good.
[54:53.640 --> 54:54.360]  Rob Deere.
[54:54.680 --> 54:54.920]  Oh.
[54:55.220 --> 54:56.340]  This is fucked up.
[54:56.380 --> 54:57.280]  These are all fucked up.
[54:57.720 --> 54:58.400]  Brian Smith.
[54:59.040 --> 54:59.480]  Melina Perez.
[54:59.560 --> 54:59.900]  These are...
[54:59.900 --> 55:00.400]  This is a...
[55:00.400 --> 55:00.960]  Wally Joyner.
[55:01.040 --> 55:02.300]  Let's hope there's no good cards in here.
[55:02.540 --> 55:03.260]  What's fucked up?
[55:03.680 --> 55:05.540]  The bottom right's fucking toast.
[55:05.640 --> 55:06.260]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[55:06.400 --> 55:07.660]  It probably landed on the table.
[55:09.040 --> 55:10.020]  Point of impact.
[55:11.960 --> 55:12.440]  All right.
[55:12.460 --> 55:14.060]  We're down to the last five minutes.
[55:14.380 --> 55:15.640]  What do you really want out of this one?
[55:15.640 --> 55:19.140]  I really want to get that Juan Gonzalez error card for Gus.
[55:19.480 --> 55:20.380]  Randy Myers.
[55:20.600 --> 55:21.440]  Geoff Hewson.
[55:21.560 --> 55:22.500]  John Smoltz.
[55:22.660 --> 55:23.120]  Carl...
[55:23.740 --> 55:24.200]  Snipski.
[55:24.580 --> 55:25.420]  Mark Barrett.
[55:25.620 --> 55:27.020]  Andy Van Slyke.
[55:27.940 --> 55:29.320]  That's a baseball name right there.
[55:29.420 --> 55:30.380]  Great baseball name.
[55:30.520 --> 55:31.940]  Also sounds like a posh, rich guy.
[55:32.120 --> 55:35.420]  That sounds like a fake name from that Japanese baseball game where they try to make up, like,
[55:35.480 --> 55:36.080]  English names.
[55:36.500 --> 55:37.840]  I think Van Slyke was one of them.
[55:38.760 --> 55:39.800]  Kevin Gross.
[55:40.100 --> 55:40.380]  Ugh.
[55:40.520 --> 55:40.860]  Don.
[55:44.380 --> 55:45.640]  In chat, who is that?
[55:46.980 --> 55:49.740]  Periboy913 says, they could flood the market with some of these cards.
[55:49.920 --> 55:50.600]  That fucking got me.
[55:51.260 --> 55:52.140]  Candy Maldonado.
[55:52.200 --> 55:52.680]  That's food.
[55:52.940 --> 55:53.060]  Yep.
[55:53.320 --> 55:54.180]  Dave Bergman.
[55:54.360 --> 55:55.320]  Stan Javier.
[55:55.880 --> 55:56.760]  Melito Perez.
[55:57.240 --> 55:58.420]  Lloyd McClendon.
[55:58.500 --> 55:59.560]  Nolan Rogers.
[56:00.980 --> 56:01.620]  That's money.
[56:01.700 --> 56:02.140]  Oh, boy.
[56:02.240 --> 56:03.780]  That's probably 50 or 100 bucks.
[56:04.120 --> 56:04.780]  Dave Schmidt.
[56:04.920 --> 56:05.380]  Julio Franco.
[56:05.460 --> 56:07.340]  Do you have a list for people with two first names?
[56:08.080 --> 56:08.600]  That's a good one.
[56:08.600 --> 56:09.100]  No, we don't.
[56:09.100 --> 56:10.140]  Because Stan Ryan would have been in there.
[56:10.160 --> 56:10.840]  Stan Ryan.
[56:10.840 --> 56:11.380]  All right.
[56:11.500 --> 56:11.880]  Double name.
[56:12.040 --> 56:12.380]  Two first names.
[56:12.500 --> 56:13.340]  Let me find that now.
[56:13.380 --> 56:13.820]  Name on name.
[56:13.880 --> 56:15.200]  It was one of the last ones you just did.
[56:15.480 --> 56:16.300]  Stan Ryan.
[56:16.700 --> 56:17.160]  Stan Javier?
[56:17.980 --> 56:18.440]  Was that it?
[56:18.520 --> 56:18.940]  Maybe that was it.
[56:19.020 --> 56:19.380]  Stan Javier.
[56:19.580 --> 56:20.240]  Maybe that was it.
[56:20.460 --> 56:20.840]  Yeah, Stan Javier.
[56:20.860 --> 56:21.920]  There's so many fucking names.
[56:22.260 --> 56:22.760]  Two first names.
[56:23.200 --> 56:24.980]  We'll have to keep our eyes open for this going forward.
[56:25.300 --> 56:25.580]  All right.
[56:25.700 --> 56:26.640]  We're going to open up a few more.
[56:26.660 --> 56:27.080]  I'm not going to cheat.
[56:27.200 --> 56:31.760]  And next week, it'll be more of a normal fuckface break show.
[56:33.340 --> 56:33.660]  I...
[56:33.660 --> 56:34.500]  It's in there somewhere.
[56:34.640 --> 56:35.460]  I can't get to it.
[56:35.820 --> 56:36.060]  It's...
[56:36.060 --> 56:36.400]  What are you looking for?
[56:37.420 --> 56:38.000]  Oh, yeah.
[56:38.100 --> 56:38.520]  It's down there.
[56:39.300 --> 56:40.180]  Oh, it was your button?
[56:40.440 --> 56:41.700]  Oh, face break show.
[56:41.960 --> 56:43.100]  Tune in next week.
[56:43.360 --> 56:44.240]  It'll be a normal week.
[56:44.320 --> 56:45.220]  We'll open some weird stuff.
[56:45.300 --> 56:46.540]  I got a bunch of...
[56:46.540 --> 56:47.440]  I ordered...
[56:47.440 --> 56:49.240]  Oh, I special ordered some cards for Emily.
[56:49.620 --> 56:51.000]  I ordered two different sets.
[56:51.480 --> 56:51.860]  Two different...
[56:51.860 --> 56:52.520]  Three packs each.
[56:52.620 --> 56:54.080]  So I got you six special packs of cards.
[56:54.140 --> 56:54.820]  We'll open next week.
[56:54.940 --> 56:55.980]  And they're going to be fun.
[56:56.160 --> 56:56.500]  Maybe some Barbie cards?
[56:56.500 --> 56:57.240]  You're going to be very excited.
[56:57.300 --> 56:57.560]  Maybe.
[56:57.740 --> 56:58.480]  Maybe some Barbie cards.
[56:58.560 --> 57:01.300]  Maybe some other TV shows that you're a big fan of.
[57:01.580 --> 57:03.060]  Like a recent fan?
[57:03.360 --> 57:04.520]  Like maybe you've been a fan...
[57:04.520 --> 57:08.280]  Maybe you've been a big fan of a certain Texas-themed show.
[57:09.580 --> 57:10.220]  Danny Darwin.
[57:10.520 --> 57:11.480]  Ron Hassey.
[57:11.660 --> 57:12.220]  Terry Fosas.
[57:12.540 --> 57:13.260]  Julio Machado.
[57:13.680 --> 57:14.580]  And then when we can get...
[57:14.580 --> 57:15.340]  Gus is a very busy man.
[57:15.820 --> 57:18.260]  But when we can get him back, we'll come back and we'll open more for sure.
[57:18.520 --> 57:18.900]  Scott Bradley.
[57:19.240 --> 57:21.860]  I can take these off your hands and keep them with our stuff.
[57:22.080 --> 57:23.300]  So you don't have to keep them next to your desk anymore.
[57:25.180 --> 57:25.820]  Scott Bradley.
[57:26.040 --> 57:26.960]  That's a great one, Gus.
[57:27.260 --> 57:28.300]  Thanks for being here for me.
[57:28.420 --> 57:30.140]  I feel like you need to be like the little...
[57:30.140 --> 57:30.840]  Joe Carter?
[57:32.580 --> 57:33.700]  Is Carter a first name?
[57:33.740 --> 57:34.280]  Carter's a first name.
[57:34.280 --> 57:34.500]  Yeah.
[57:35.080 --> 57:35.920]  Carter Page, right?
[57:35.960 --> 57:36.380]  That dipshit?
[57:37.380 --> 57:38.620]  Joe Bover.
[57:40.040 --> 57:41.280]  Greg Myers.
[57:41.560 --> 57:42.380]  Roger McDowell.
[57:43.420 --> 57:44.440]  Dave Righetti.
[57:45.280 --> 57:46.440]  Names that sound like spaghetti.
[57:46.900 --> 57:48.180]  Danny Jackson.
[57:48.680 --> 57:49.840]  Dave Steeb.
[57:50.160 --> 57:51.160]  Bill Schroeder.
[57:51.680 --> 57:52.620]  Otis Nixon.
[57:52.960 --> 57:54.560]  I see the steroids starting to creep in.
[57:56.640 --> 57:57.880]  Bart Giamatti.
[57:58.040 --> 57:59.220]  Commissioner cards.
[57:59.440 --> 57:59.880]  Leave that.
[58:01.130 --> 58:02.400]  You know who Bart Giamatti...
[58:02.400 --> 58:03.160]  Let me see this for a second.
[58:03.240 --> 58:04.240]  You know who Bart Giamatti is?
[58:04.340 --> 58:04.500]  No.
[58:05.400 --> 58:06.660]  We've talked about it on this show before.
[58:07.120 --> 58:08.000]  You know who Bart Giamatti is?
[58:08.100 --> 58:08.760]  Can you take a guess?
[58:08.820 --> 58:10.140]  Is he Paul Giamatti's father?
[58:10.320 --> 58:11.120]  Paul Giamatti's father.
[58:11.120 --> 58:11.420]  Really?
[58:11.420 --> 58:11.820]  Is it really?
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.200]  Bart Giamatti is Paul Giamatti's father.
[58:14.320 --> 58:15.540]  He was commissioner until he died.
[58:15.640 --> 58:16.580]  He wasn't commissioner for very long.
[58:16.600 --> 58:17.420]  I had no idea.
[58:17.660 --> 58:18.380]  Oh, wow.
[58:18.820 --> 58:19.500]  Yeah, he's legit.
[58:19.600 --> 58:19.880]  His dad.
[58:20.200 --> 58:21.340]  Let's open up a pack of these.
[58:21.880 --> 58:22.160]  Fleer.
[58:22.340 --> 58:22.980]  Get them out of the way.
[58:23.040 --> 58:24.360]  And then we're gonna end on the Donruss.
[58:24.520 --> 58:25.520]  We're gonna end strong on Donruss.
[58:25.600 --> 58:26.140]  We're gonna get a...
[58:26.140 --> 58:26.620]  You wanna get a Bowman?
[58:26.760 --> 58:27.060]  $500.
[58:27.380 --> 58:28.920]  We'll end strong on Bowman and Donruss.
[58:28.920 --> 58:33.640]  We'll get a Juan Gonzalez negative card and we'll get a billion dollars.
[58:33.720 --> 58:40.080]  Kevin Mitchell, Vince Coleman, Martin Clary, Jim Deshaies, Don Paul, Sandy Alomar Jr.,
[58:40.080 --> 58:40.860]  Dave Winfield.
[58:41.020 --> 58:42.720]  That's a fucking winning smile right there.
[58:42.920 --> 58:44.380]  That's Winfield with a winning smile.
[58:44.440 --> 58:44.900]  I love that.
[58:45.020 --> 58:46.120]  We should appreciate the good.
[58:46.260 --> 58:46.520]  Yeah.
[58:47.340 --> 58:48.340]  Frank DiPino.
[58:52.600 --> 58:53.600]  Come on.
[58:53.680 --> 58:55.260]  Do you think it's a body part or a pussy slight?
[58:56.180 --> 58:56.960]  Fred Lynn.
[58:57.440 --> 58:58.110]  Mike McFarlane.
[58:58.110 --> 58:58.730]  Mike McFarlane.
[58:58.890 --> 59:00.230]  Rolando Rooms.
[59:00.710 --> 59:01.330]  Matt Winters.
[59:02.310 --> 59:03.270]  Rick Cerrone.
[59:03.630 --> 59:04.610]  Sid Bream again.
[59:04.750 --> 59:05.330]  That's a fish.
[59:05.630 --> 59:06.290]  John Moses.
[59:06.530 --> 59:06.790]  Okay.
[59:07.110 --> 59:08.770]  It is $459.
[59:08.790 --> 59:14.250]  They're gonna cut us out any moment, so we're gonna go out on these 89 Bowmans.
[59:15.930 --> 59:19.390]  Bowman a little less common than Topps and Fleer and Donruss.
[59:19.710 --> 59:22.030]  So, these are oversized cards though, which was annoying.
[59:22.710 --> 59:23.330]  And they didn't...
[59:23.690 --> 59:24.410]  You have to read the back.
[59:24.470 --> 59:26.290]  Alan Anderson, unless you can read their bad handwriting.
[59:26.910 --> 59:27.830]  Geoff Parrott.
[59:27.830 --> 59:29.150]  Oh, that's an animal.
[59:29.430 --> 59:29.450]  Yeah.
[59:29.710 --> 59:31.990]  Not the way he spells it, but...
[59:31.990 --> 59:32.570]  Ty Griffin.
[59:35.690 --> 59:37.050]  Jamie Quirk.
[59:37.550 --> 59:38.230]  What?
[59:38.610 --> 59:38.910]  Yeah.
[59:39.750 --> 59:41.650]  Steve's covered in gum.
[59:42.350 --> 59:43.750]  Here's that dude.
[59:44.750 --> 59:45.610]  Oh, here we go.
[59:45.790 --> 59:46.730]  Eric Davis.
[59:47.870 --> 59:49.090]  Tim Loudner.
[59:50.070 --> 59:51.570]  He signed his dick.
[59:52.290 --> 59:52.970]  Interesting.
[59:52.990 --> 59:53.990]  He's like, that's where my Loudner comes from.
[59:53.990 --> 59:54.590]  Yeah.
[59:56.310 --> 59:57.210]  Say it Loudner.
[59:59.190 --> 59:59.990]  Charlie Liebrandt.
[59:59.990 --> 01:00:01.130]  Barry Larkin.
[01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.830]  Eric Cho.
[01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:05.330]  And Kelly Gruber.
[01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:07.350]  That's fucking dork.
[01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:08.570]  All right.
[01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:09.570]  This is the last pack.
[01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:10.230]  And then we're gonna go.
[01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:11.050]  They're gonna cut us off.
[01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:12.590]  We're opening up this last pack.
[01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:17.230]  We're gonna stay one minute long to open up this last pack to get this wand down to all those cards.
[01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:17.650]  This is it.
[01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:18.150]  This is very exciting.
[01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:18.990]  Jose Lind.
[01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:20.570]  Dale Murphy.
[01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:21.970]  Andre Dawson.
[01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:22.670]  He was a big cat.
[01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.970]  Kevin McReynolds.
[01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:25.170]  Darnell Cole.
[01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:26.650]  George Bell.
[01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:27.650]  Randy Bush.
[01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:29.090]  Hell yeah.
[01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:30.250]  Howard Johnson.
[01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:32.630]  Here's the crime dog.
[01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:33.510]  Fred McGriff.
[01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:34.210]  Oh yeah.
[01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:35.410]  Dan Gladden.
[01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:36.650]  Tim Raines.
[01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:37.670]  Dwight Goodens.
[01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:38.210]  Great player.
[01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:39.670]  Damon Berryhill.
[01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:40.970]  Lonnie Smith.
[01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.990]  Scott Geraltz.
[01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:43.310]  And Mike Lavalier.
[01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:44.310]  That was it.
[01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:44.890]  We didn't get it.
[01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:45.770]  We will get it next time.
[01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:46.430]  It's in here somewhere.
[01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:47.650]  It's bound to be in here.
[01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:49.090]  Thanks for tuning in.
[01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:50.510]  Hopefully you'll come back next week.
[01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:51.570]  We probably won't have Gus.
[01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:53.950]  We'll be a more traditional episode with all of our nonsense.
[01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:56.550]  We gotta figure out what to do with all this shit now.
[01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:57.970]  Bye.
[01:00:58.550 --> 01:00:58.810]  Bye.
