[00:30.880 --> 00:33.480]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:40.440 --> 00:43.280]  The mermaids weren't real, but what they did in the documentary,
[00:43.460 --> 00:46.320]  they tried to make real mermaid footage, and they tried to trick you.
[00:46.540 --> 00:48.780]  Are you doing an Anma kid-style intro?
[00:48.880 --> 00:50.800]  I would never. Good morning, Geoff.
[00:51.020 --> 00:52.760]  Good morning. Good morning, Eric.
[00:53.200 --> 00:57.640]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of Face Breaks Shit.
[00:57.800 --> 01:03.720]  This is the show where we break shit and talk about stuff and show off stuff.
[01:03.740 --> 01:05.100]  We did a little bit of show and tell today, Eric.
[01:05.100 --> 01:05.600]  Oh, that's fun.
[01:05.600 --> 01:06.800]  We've got some fun stuff.
[01:06.840 --> 01:07.260]  Let's do it.
[01:07.400 --> 01:10.840]  And you'll notice something special about today's episode.
[01:11.400 --> 01:15.440]  Sort of an extra special episode. We cut out all the hangers on.
[01:16.020 --> 01:19.140]  We got rid of Gavin. We got rid of Andrew. We got rid of Emily.
[01:22.140 --> 01:24.060]  What do you call it? High maintenance, no talents?
[01:24.140 --> 01:24.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:25.300 --> 01:25.920]  We got rid of them.
[01:25.940 --> 01:26.660]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:27.300 --> 01:30.120]  I was going to say, that's pretty cool for you to say and then go home.
[01:30.120 --> 01:37.580]  No, that's right. God damn, man. I said some shit about boomers on Anima.
[01:37.720 --> 01:37.960]  Yeah.
[01:38.200 --> 01:39.820]  And I got a call from my mother.
[01:39.900 --> 01:40.560]  Did you really?
[01:40.800 --> 01:41.020]  Yeah.
[01:41.120 --> 01:42.320]  Your mom listens to podcasts?
[01:42.500 --> 01:43.360]  I didn't realize it.
[01:43.460 --> 01:44.520]  Oh, wow. That's pretty exciting.
[01:44.640 --> 01:44.860]  Yeah.
[01:45.280 --> 01:48.980]  Wow. And what did she say? She just sort of like talked down to you about...
[01:48.980 --> 01:51.860]  It was... I got a drubbing. Yeah.
[01:52.040 --> 01:53.200]  Well, what are you going to do? She's my mom.
[01:53.320 --> 01:55.780]  It's your mom. Hey, great shirt you have.
[01:55.900 --> 01:57.000]  You're never too old to be taught.
[01:57.080 --> 01:59.060]  Hey, I'm doing another thing. Hey, great shirt you have.
[02:00.420 --> 02:03.940]  Hey, thanks. This is a great shirt. I like it a lot. I'm a shirt haver.
[02:04.160 --> 02:04.300]  Uh-huh.
[02:04.720 --> 02:05.680]  I'm a shirt haver haver.
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.940]  The trademark on the top side is...
[02:09.940 --> 02:10.160]  And be real.
[02:11.160 --> 02:11.280]  Right?
[02:11.700 --> 02:13.620]  There's no way we trademark shirt haver.
[02:13.880 --> 02:16.300]  Anyway. I think that's how you do it, right?
[02:16.300 --> 02:17.400]  Yeah. Yeah. You just throw it on there.
[02:17.480 --> 02:18.080]  Yeah, you just throw it on there.
[02:18.080 --> 02:21.200]  If you just start putting TMs on stuff, who's stopping you? You're fine.
[02:21.460 --> 02:22.880]  You can get this in our store today.
[02:23.240 --> 02:25.140]  You can also get this. Go to the overhead camera.
[02:26.140 --> 02:27.600]  Oh, you know, we should have brought bread.
[02:27.720 --> 02:28.000]  What?
[02:28.140 --> 02:29.220]  No, we didn't need to bring bread.
[02:29.220 --> 02:31.180]  Wow, look, it's the bread clip.
[02:31.940 --> 02:32.500]  Listen to this.
[02:33.840 --> 02:36.980]  I don't think they can probably hear that because it's your microphones over here.
[02:38.800 --> 02:39.620]  Can you hear this, Nick?
[02:40.620 --> 02:40.940]  Okay.
[02:44.000 --> 02:45.860]  I was hoping it would cover up that other thing.
[02:46.640 --> 02:47.980]  This is sturdy metal.
[02:48.180 --> 02:48.980]  We discussed this.
[02:49.120 --> 02:50.780]  Flip it. Flip it over so people can see it's a magnet.
[02:50.820 --> 02:51.960]  We discussed this. Well, I was gonna...
[02:51.960 --> 02:52.980]  That was gonna be the big reveal.
[02:54.660 --> 02:57.140]  So let me get some facts about the fuck face break...
[02:57.880 --> 02:58.900]  Fuck face bread clip.
[02:59.440 --> 03:01.900]  First off, it's emblemized with my birthday.
[03:02.060 --> 03:02.820]  It is. June 19th.
[03:02.840 --> 03:03.260]  It's awesome.
[03:03.420 --> 03:05.620]  Not just my birthday. It's also Juneteenth.
[03:05.700 --> 03:08.440]  It's also a Garfield's birthday, who I just thought is dead.
[03:09.060 --> 03:10.060]  Do you guys know Garfield died?
[03:11.040 --> 03:12.020]  Yeah, years ago.
[03:12.500 --> 03:13.360]  What are you talking about?
[03:13.440 --> 03:16.280]  There was a final Garfield comic and it's the saddest thing ever.
[03:16.800 --> 03:18.100]  He's like in like the haunted house.
[03:18.200 --> 03:19.800]  Like it's like, oh, this spooky, like run down house.
[03:19.820 --> 03:21.100]  And he's like, oh, John, where are you?
[03:21.120 --> 03:21.820]  I don't think he really died.
[03:21.920 --> 03:23.560]  No, no, it's the one where he's laying in his bed.
[03:23.640 --> 03:26.260]  And it just is zzzz and then zzzz and then no zzzz.
[03:27.520 --> 03:28.540]  And then the comic's over.
[03:29.220 --> 03:30.180]  It's really depressing.
[03:30.380 --> 03:30.900]  Kill Garfield?
[03:31.080 --> 03:32.560]  Yeah, they killed Garfield in the 90s, I guess.
[03:34.200 --> 03:35.900]  Which is, you know, he was born in the 70s.
[03:35.940 --> 03:37.260]  That's like 20 something years long.
[03:37.360 --> 03:38.360]  It's a long time for a cat.
[03:38.460 --> 03:39.020]  It's a long time for a cat.
[03:39.080 --> 03:40.880]  You know, like the world's oldest cat, I think lives in Austin.
[03:40.940 --> 03:41.420]  Austin, Texas.
[03:41.440 --> 03:41.880]  Isn't that cool?
[03:41.940 --> 03:44.480]  And the previous world's oldest cat lived in Austin.
[03:44.640 --> 03:46.740]  I wonder what they're doing to cats here in Austin to make them...
[03:46.740 --> 03:48.260]  Apparently, I read an article.
[03:48.380 --> 03:49.260]  It's a very special diet.
[03:49.380 --> 03:51.120]  The guy or lady has worked out.
[03:51.160 --> 03:52.140]  A special diet for a cat?
[03:52.380 --> 03:53.020]  Special cat diet.
[03:53.080 --> 03:55.300]  I don't even have a special diet for me and I'm a human man.
[03:55.620 --> 03:57.240]  I know. That's it right there with you.
[03:57.240 --> 03:59.560]  I would say the same, except there's a very special diet.
[04:01.000 --> 04:02.520]  It requires a lot of preparation.
[04:03.180 --> 04:06.200]  Not just Garfield's birthday, Superman's birthday.
[04:06.420 --> 04:08.080]  Also, June 19th. A lot of people didn't know that.
[04:09.020 --> 04:10.540]  June 19th, 1938.
[04:10.900 --> 04:11.620]  Superman was born.
[04:12.420 --> 04:13.420]  Action Comics number one.
[04:14.980 --> 04:18.580]  In addition, it is the color of a sort of a cornflower blue.
[04:18.680 --> 04:19.680]  You know what that signifies?
[04:19.840 --> 04:20.360]  The date.
[04:20.560 --> 04:20.940]  The day.
[04:21.140 --> 04:24.040]  The day of the week that the bread was shelled.
[04:25.040 --> 04:25.880]  Blue is a Monday.
[04:25.880 --> 04:29.320]  We're spending so much time on this fucking bread clip.
[04:29.480 --> 04:30.260]  And we're not done yet.
[04:31.420 --> 04:31.820]  Wow!
[04:32.400 --> 04:33.200]  There's a magnet on it.
[04:33.220 --> 04:34.340]  There's a little magnet on it.
[04:34.840 --> 04:37.020]  Yeah, it sticks to shit.
[04:37.080 --> 04:37.480]  Isn't that fun?
[04:37.900 --> 04:40.040]  Yeah, it sticks to that.
[04:41.960 --> 04:43.520]  Look at how strong it is.
[04:44.080 --> 04:46.040]  All right, I'm getting too lost in the book here.
[04:46.040 --> 04:48.180]  You are. Give me this. This came off my fridge.
[04:49.140 --> 04:50.660]  I could have kept going for like 45 minutes.
[04:50.720 --> 04:53.360]  We also have the temporary tattoos.
[04:53.920 --> 04:54.960]  You can grab the...
[04:54.960 --> 04:56.280]  So please don't get real tattoos anymore.
[04:56.920 --> 04:59.280]  There are so many people that have actual tattoos of this.
[04:59.600 --> 05:01.520]  Yeah, the Don Pedro and the Pencil a lot.
[05:01.680 --> 05:03.320]  There are a lot. The Pencil is a good one though.
[05:03.480 --> 05:05.300]  The Pencil is like that style that I really like.
[05:06.300 --> 05:06.660]  Man.
[05:07.000 --> 05:08.560]  I got it so you guys don't have to.
[05:08.800 --> 05:09.000]  Right.
[05:09.020 --> 05:09.980]  You guys just get the temporary tattoos.
[05:10.260 --> 05:12.340]  There's also Uniform. Nobody has that, so...
[05:12.340 --> 05:13.440]  I'm definitely not getting that one.
[05:13.440 --> 05:14.480]  No. So there you go.
[05:14.540 --> 05:17.600]  Oh, this Vancouver Child Kicker one's fucking cool.
[05:17.720 --> 05:19.140]  Maybe even we could check something else?
[05:19.320 --> 05:19.560]  Oh, yeah.
[05:19.760 --> 05:20.160]  Vancouver Child Kicker.
[05:20.200 --> 05:21.060]  Interesting. Interesting.
[05:21.740 --> 05:23.220]  Some shirts. Shirt Haver shirt.
[05:24.680 --> 05:25.680]  Thrice to Meet You.
[05:25.940 --> 05:26.700]  That's a cool one.
[05:26.760 --> 05:27.280]  That's a good one.
[05:27.420 --> 05:31.840]  They said that we... it was too cost prohibitive to make an actual...
[05:31.840 --> 05:32.160]  Yes.
[05:32.440 --> 05:33.480]  ...sellable Thrice to Meet You.
[05:33.560 --> 05:36.180]  So they said the best thing we could do is a line drawing on a shirt.
[05:36.500 --> 05:40.420]  This is the Money Laundromat shirt that comes in blue, but also comes in white.
[05:42.200 --> 05:43.780]  Money Laundromat. It's in the name.
[05:45.260 --> 05:50.540]  Also, that was a commission by a community member whose name is mentioned on the Instagram post.
[05:50.540 --> 05:51.060]  Oh, that's fun.
[05:51.180 --> 05:53.200]  So go check out these things in the store.
[05:53.200 --> 05:54.620]  Get them or don't get them.
[05:54.700 --> 05:54.860]  Yeah.
[05:55.220 --> 05:55.500]  Whatever.
[05:55.620 --> 05:55.980]  Yeah, whatever.
[05:56.120 --> 05:56.500]  You like them.
[05:56.600 --> 05:59.180]  Look, I'm telling you about them so you can go get them, but it doesn't mean you have to.
[05:59.200 --> 06:00.560]  But we're not trying to sell up your ass right now.
[06:00.660 --> 06:01.080]  No, I don't really care.
[06:01.540 --> 06:02.440]  Let's get started.
[06:03.680 --> 06:05.920]  Let's do some of the shit that we're here to do.
[06:06.040 --> 06:06.980]  Oh, you know what? We don't have...
[06:09.680 --> 06:10.800]  Sorry, Fred and Shacker.
[06:10.880 --> 06:11.460]  Oh, that was close.
[06:12.780 --> 06:13.720]  Can't do it without Fred.
[06:15.860 --> 06:16.460]  Dude, all right.
[06:16.980 --> 06:17.180]  What?
[06:17.240 --> 06:18.040]  All right, if you're gonna...
[06:18.040 --> 06:18.300]  What?
[06:18.300 --> 06:19.060]  You might as well bring it out.
[06:19.120 --> 06:19.340]  What?
[06:21.240 --> 06:22.340]  These are on sale at RTX.
[06:22.900 --> 06:23.800]  Not just at RTX.
[06:23.960 --> 06:25.940]  They'll be on sale globally as well.
[06:26.000 --> 06:27.820]  If we have any left, they'll be on sale right away.
[06:28.140 --> 06:32.400]  I don't anticipate there being any of these left.
[06:32.580 --> 06:35.300]  I just imagine like a sea of like 500 people.
[06:35.340 --> 06:36.200]  You're in a convention.
[06:36.600 --> 06:37.040]  Lightsabers.
[06:37.660 --> 06:38.560]  In a convention.
[06:39.120 --> 06:40.000]  This is one.
[06:40.420 --> 06:40.620]  Yeah.
[06:41.240 --> 06:41.920]  We're gonna...
[06:41.920 --> 06:44.000]  I want a World Cup this thing.
[06:44.440 --> 06:46.940]  Oh, you want this to be the new Vuvuzela?
[06:47.120 --> 06:47.520]  Nice.
[06:48.060 --> 06:48.820]  That's pretty exciting.
[06:49.280 --> 06:51.900]  All right, we should start with the pack sack.
[06:51.940 --> 06:52.320]  Let's do it.
[06:53.180 --> 06:54.400]  It's a sack pack, but that's fine.
[06:54.600 --> 06:55.860]  If you're new to fuckface break shit.
[06:58.020 --> 06:58.340]  Oh.
[06:59.360 --> 07:00.900]  I might have been a little late on that one, Nick.
[07:02.780 --> 07:04.220]  The pack sack runs the show.
[07:04.360 --> 07:07.840]  Every time we start an episode, we open up a pack from the pack sack.
[07:07.980 --> 07:08.920]  Whoa, what are these?
[07:08.940 --> 07:11.380]  And then every time we open up a box, we throw one in.
[07:11.780 --> 07:13.200]  You gotta feed it as you eat from it.
[07:13.300 --> 07:17.200]  This is 1991-1992 Skybox basketball.
[07:17.320 --> 07:17.600]  Okay.
[07:18.160 --> 07:19.620]  So I'll put that right there.
[07:20.880 --> 07:22.180]  We are gonna pop...
[07:22.180 --> 07:23.600]  These are 84 cents, huh?
[07:23.680 --> 07:26.340]  Well, probably at the time they were purchased at Walmart.
[07:26.680 --> 07:26.800]  Oh.
[07:27.020 --> 07:28.760]  I would assume 1991 or 92.
[07:29.540 --> 07:31.680]  I think Jordan's your chase card here.
[07:31.800 --> 07:32.440]  That's about it.
[07:32.680 --> 07:33.500]  Yeah, you think we're getting one?
[07:34.220 --> 07:35.040]  Come on.
[07:35.080 --> 07:35.820]  I don't have that kind of luck.
[07:38.880 --> 07:39.760]  All right.
[07:39.780 --> 07:40.540]  A Christmas sweater.
[07:40.680 --> 07:41.740]  Okay, let's see what we got here.
[07:42.040 --> 07:43.420]  We got Isaiah Thomas.
[07:43.600 --> 07:43.860]  No.
[07:44.240 --> 07:45.880]  Bad boy for life.
[07:46.000 --> 07:46.600]  Yeah, no kidding.
[07:46.620 --> 07:47.620]  Kevin Willis.
[07:47.660 --> 07:47.880]  Okay.
[07:48.800 --> 07:49.680]  Johnny Dawkins.
[07:50.400 --> 07:51.400]  Oh, here we go.
[07:51.400 --> 07:53.640]  The Chicago Bulls starting team.
[07:53.700 --> 07:53.960]  There we go.
[07:54.000 --> 07:54.880]  Michael Jordan right there.
[07:54.920 --> 07:55.400]  Oh, let's see.
[07:55.520 --> 07:55.840]  We got him.
[07:56.060 --> 07:56.540]  There you go.
[07:56.840 --> 07:57.420]  Not the same.
[07:57.740 --> 07:58.700]  Greg Drelling.
[07:58.980 --> 08:02.740]  Oh, Ralph Sampson with the very, very dated background.
[08:02.880 --> 08:03.340]  With his...
[08:03.340 --> 08:05.980]  The background looks like the fuck stick that...
[08:05.980 --> 08:07.560]  It looks like if you turn that card, it goes...
[08:08.340 --> 08:10.980]  It looks like it's like a high-speed shot.
[08:11.040 --> 08:11.200]  Yeah.
[08:13.100 --> 08:13.800]  Joe whatever.
[08:14.420 --> 08:15.040]  Oh, there you go.
[08:15.060 --> 08:15.660]  Patrick Ewing.
[08:15.960 --> 08:16.340]  All right.
[08:16.580 --> 08:17.880]  I believe he coached in Georgetown.
[08:18.120 --> 08:18.260]  Yeah.
[08:18.420 --> 08:20.900]  Remember when the Knicks were supposed to be like the team in the 90s?
[08:20.900 --> 08:21.860]  And then boy, they weren't.
[08:21.980 --> 08:23.720]  There was a funny story about...
[08:23.720 --> 08:24.080]  You're right.
[08:24.140 --> 08:24.540]  They weren't.
[08:24.600 --> 08:25.200]  It was a funny...
[08:25.200 --> 08:26.180]  And then they haven't been censored.
[08:27.220 --> 08:29.580]  There was a funny story about Patrick Ewing recently.
[08:29.860 --> 08:31.440]  He went to Madison Square Garden.
[08:31.640 --> 08:32.440]  This is in the last season.
[08:32.460 --> 08:32.920]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:33.140 --> 08:35.600]  And the security didn't recognize him and they wouldn't let him out.
[08:35.640 --> 08:35.820]  Yep.
[08:36.100 --> 08:36.780]  And he was like...
[08:36.780 --> 08:37.540]  He fucking lost.
[08:37.600 --> 08:38.820]  He was like, you know who the fuck I am?
[08:39.040 --> 08:40.560]  I built this fucking building.
[08:40.780 --> 08:41.060]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[08:41.200 --> 08:42.720]  And they had to issue a public apology.
[08:42.860 --> 08:43.020]  Yeah.
[08:43.020 --> 08:43.620]  Otis Smith.
[08:43.660 --> 08:44.120]  Did security ask him?
[08:44.120 --> 08:45.640]  And they had to go like, we do know who you are.
[08:45.660 --> 08:47.460]  Did security say, show me a ring?
[08:47.660 --> 08:48.440]  And then they just...
[08:48.440 --> 08:49.900]  This is my ring right there.
[08:50.000 --> 08:51.500]  It's in their fucking rafters.
[08:51.560 --> 08:52.100]  Buck Johnson.
[08:52.320 --> 08:53.080]  There's my ID.
[08:53.880 --> 08:54.600]  Eddie Johnson.
[08:55.340 --> 08:56.360]  Uh, can't read that.
[08:56.420 --> 08:56.780]  Don't care.
[08:57.160 --> 08:59.080]  Sam Bowie and Terry Porter.
[08:59.480 --> 09:00.000]  So there you go.
[09:00.120 --> 09:00.940]  Pretty dog shit pack.
[09:00.940 --> 09:01.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[09:01.640 --> 09:02.040]  Rough pack.
[09:02.260 --> 09:02.720]  No worries.
[09:02.900 --> 09:03.100]  Thanks.
[09:03.240 --> 09:03.640]  Got Isaiah.
[09:04.280 --> 09:04.620]  What's this?
[09:04.720 --> 09:05.440]  Open up another pack.
[09:05.480 --> 09:05.820]  One more?
[09:05.960 --> 09:06.720]  Maybe we'll find a Zim.
[09:07.740 --> 09:08.100]  Maybe.
[09:09.480 --> 09:10.680]  I'm looking for a Zim Padres.
[09:11.320 --> 09:11.680]  That's...
[09:11.680 --> 09:13.180]  We were talking about that before the show.
[09:13.500 --> 09:15.380]  Yeah, it would be nice to find a Zim Padres.
[09:15.500 --> 09:16.740]  I want a little Padre Zim.
[09:16.820 --> 09:17.140]  Well, fuck.
[09:17.200 --> 09:17.780]  I'm trying to...
[09:18.440 --> 09:19.960]  Are you trying to game the...
[09:19.960 --> 09:20.220]  I'm not.
[09:20.240 --> 09:20.760]  I can't do it.
[09:20.900 --> 09:21.240]  I can't do it.
[09:21.260 --> 09:21.640]  I can't game it.
[09:21.680 --> 09:22.800]  I was trying to, but you found it.
[09:22.860 --> 09:23.020]  See?
[09:23.920 --> 09:24.980]  It's going to get in there deep.
[09:25.420 --> 09:25.740]  Okay.
[09:26.580 --> 09:26.900]  Okay.
[09:27.100 --> 09:27.760]  I don't like that.
[09:28.780 --> 09:31.680]  X-Files Season 2.
[09:31.920 --> 09:32.620]  Okay, here we go.
[09:32.840 --> 09:33.280]  All right, guys.
[09:33.320 --> 09:34.100]  These are cards.
[09:34.220 --> 09:35.020]  And what's your chaser here?
[09:35.100 --> 09:35.780]  Mulder or Scully?
[09:36.500 --> 09:37.080]  Smoking Man?
[09:37.940 --> 09:38.260]  CSM.
[09:38.420 --> 09:39.200]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:41.700 --> 09:45.680]  Everybody go ahead and reset yourselves to like 1991.
[09:46.080 --> 09:46.260]  Okay.
[09:46.260 --> 09:46.900]  I assume.
[09:48.120 --> 09:50.020]  Re-familiarize yourself with Season 2 of X-Files.
[09:50.460 --> 09:51.740]  So it'll all just pop right off.
[09:51.920 --> 09:52.300]  We got it.
[09:52.400 --> 09:53.320]  Oh, why are they stuck?
[09:53.440 --> 09:54.060]  Oh, they're sticky.
[09:54.360 --> 09:55.600]  All right, here we got...
[09:55.600 --> 09:56.600]  It looks like probably Chris Carter.
[09:56.800 --> 09:57.160]  I assume.
[09:57.260 --> 09:58.080]  I don't know if I've ever seen him.
[09:58.360 --> 09:59.140]  I'm not going to turn it around.
[09:59.280 --> 09:59.820]  Is that...
[10:00.160 --> 10:00.480]  Okay.
[10:00.640 --> 10:01.680]  I thought that was a guy at a piano.
[10:01.820 --> 10:03.000]  I thought maybe that was a theme song guy.
[10:03.020 --> 10:05.060]  I think it's Chris Carter at a podium being like,
[10:05.540 --> 10:06.500]  hey, I made the X-Files.
[10:06.560 --> 10:09.000]  You should like bend the cards a couple of times or something.
[10:09.360 --> 10:10.400]  Yeah, let's see.
[10:12.000 --> 10:12.780]  It's like ASMR.
[10:13.600 --> 10:14.520]  Oh, it's like that.
[10:14.560 --> 10:14.700]  Yeah.
[10:16.540 --> 10:18.000]  It's like the worst kind of ASMR.
[10:19.080 --> 10:19.520]  God.
[10:19.660 --> 10:20.140]  You mean ASMR?
[10:20.360 --> 10:20.520]  Yeah.
[10:21.480 --> 10:22.460]  There's the aliens.
[10:22.580 --> 10:23.400]  That's gotta be the chaser.
[10:24.040 --> 10:25.200]  That's gotta be the chaser.
[10:25.280 --> 10:26.260]  We found them.
[10:26.520 --> 10:27.120]  They exist.
[10:27.580 --> 10:28.480]  They do exist.
[10:28.700 --> 10:30.860]  No, that's M&Ms and Santa Claus.
[10:31.540 --> 10:32.860]  He is one.
[10:33.280 --> 10:33.840]  Oh, that's fun.
[10:34.380 --> 10:35.200]  You like...
[10:35.200 --> 10:36.480]  It's like a Stuntable Pilots album cover.
[10:36.600 --> 10:38.360]  You really like that bat right in front of you, huh?
[10:38.540 --> 10:39.340]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[10:39.560 --> 10:40.000]  Bouncing around.
[10:42.480 --> 10:43.360]  Oh, shit.
[10:44.220 --> 10:44.820]  They predi...
[10:44.820 --> 10:45.720]  God damn it.
[10:46.520 --> 10:49.460]  Look, they predicted it way back in the...
[10:49.460 --> 10:49.820]  Whatever.
[10:50.460 --> 10:53.980]  After the first series came out, they predicted it.
[10:54.180 --> 10:54.400]  Yeah.
[10:54.860 --> 10:56.260]  They predicted that it would be remade.
[10:56.360 --> 10:56.740]  Oh, wow.
[10:56.880 --> 10:57.040]  Yeah.
[10:57.140 --> 10:57.600]  It's pretty...
[10:57.600 --> 10:58.080]  It's much later.
[10:58.320 --> 10:58.760]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:58.980 --> 11:01.040]  And then the lone gunman.
[11:01.420 --> 11:01.860]  The lone gunman.
[11:02.000 --> 11:02.980]  Those guys were awesome.
[11:03.040 --> 11:03.420]  They were funny.
[11:03.540 --> 11:05.880]  The older that I got, the more I really liked those characters.
[11:06.140 --> 11:06.740]  Yeah, they were good dudes.
[11:06.820 --> 11:06.980]  Yeah.
[11:07.120 --> 11:08.400]  They're just like weird internet guys.
[11:08.420 --> 11:10.120]  Like before the internet was like...
[11:10.120 --> 11:11.220]  Yeah, you know, they'd all be...
[11:11.220 --> 11:12.360]  They'd all be queuing on now.
[11:12.440 --> 11:12.700]  Oh, yeah.
[11:12.700 --> 11:13.040]  Like there was...
[11:13.040 --> 11:13.740]  Yeah, they're all about...
[11:13.740 --> 11:14.020]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:14.040 --> 11:14.380]  That was the...
[11:14.380 --> 11:14.580]  Yeah.
[11:14.940 --> 11:15.100]  Yeah.
[11:16.420 --> 11:17.300]  Queuing on back then.
[11:17.840 --> 11:18.420]  Everything's a conspiracy.
[11:18.700 --> 11:19.080]  What are you thinking?
[11:19.380 --> 11:20.980]  Let's do some Bowman this year baseball.
[11:21.140 --> 11:21.440]  How about that?
[11:22.100 --> 11:22.660]  Sounds good.
[11:22.980 --> 11:25.400]  You were telling me that you haven't been following baseball closely this season.
[11:25.660 --> 11:27.480]  No, I'm going to jump in now that basketball's over.
[11:27.480 --> 11:27.680]  Cool.
[11:27.700 --> 11:28.540]  I'm going to disappoint with basketball.
[11:28.840 --> 11:29.200]  Okay.
[11:30.760 --> 11:31.360]  Here we go.
[11:31.620 --> 11:32.200]  Well, shit.
[11:32.300 --> 11:33.000]  Right out the gate.
[11:33.180 --> 11:34.260]  Wander Franco rookie.
[11:34.520 --> 11:34.580]  Hey!
[11:34.740 --> 11:35.560]  That is the...
[11:35.580 --> 11:36.920]  That's probably going to be...
[11:36.920 --> 11:37.860]  You probably hang on to that one.
[11:37.920 --> 11:40.280]  Yeah, that is the chase card of the year.
[11:40.320 --> 11:40.620]  Yes.
[11:40.620 --> 11:41.000]  This is...
[11:41.000 --> 11:41.640]  You...
[11:41.640 --> 11:42.140]  Big time.
[11:42.280 --> 11:45.080]  Wander Franco, good baseball player.
[11:45.180 --> 11:46.040]  Wander Franco, good at baseball.
[11:46.040 --> 11:47.380]  All right.
[11:47.840 --> 11:48.500]  Bryce Harper.
[11:48.820 --> 11:49.160]  That's...
[11:49.160 --> 11:50.360]  Fernando Tatis Jr.
[11:50.540 --> 11:51.000]  That's good.
[11:51.080 --> 11:52.060]  He's been hurt all season.
[11:52.180 --> 11:52.400]  All right.
[11:52.560 --> 11:53.480]  George Springer.
[11:53.560 --> 11:53.860]  Okay.
[11:54.240 --> 11:55.460]  Carlos Correa.
[11:55.600 --> 11:55.960]  Okay.
[11:56.700 --> 11:58.260]  Witt Merrifield.
[12:00.080 --> 12:01.320]  Matt Bierling.
[12:02.020 --> 12:05.660]  We got ourselves Gavin Sheets, rookie of the year.
[12:06.640 --> 12:07.260]  Favorite...
[12:07.260 --> 12:07.600]  Futures?
[12:07.760 --> 12:08.580]  Set that aside.
[12:08.700 --> 12:09.460]  That's a chrome.
[12:11.580 --> 12:13.060]  Edgar Correa, I think.
[12:13.100 --> 12:13.600]  I can't see it.
[12:13.900 --> 12:14.700]  Eduardo Lopez.
[12:16.900 --> 12:17.780]  Marcella Mayer.
[12:18.200 --> 12:19.140]  Kehiel Watson.
[12:19.600 --> 12:20.040]  That's a pretty card.
[12:21.840 --> 12:22.280]  What?
[12:25.380 --> 12:26.760]  Here's Warming Bernabel.
[12:27.080 --> 12:28.380]  That's a baseball name.
[12:28.560 --> 12:29.560]  Boy, that's a...
[12:29.560 --> 12:30.620]  His name is Warming?
[12:30.800 --> 12:31.240]  Warming.
[12:31.720 --> 12:32.560]  That's awesome.
[12:33.040 --> 12:33.580]  As in like...
[12:34.860 --> 12:35.120]  Yeah.
[12:35.340 --> 12:36.140]  No, yeah, no, I...
[12:36.140 --> 12:37.060]  You don't have to explain what Warming...
[12:37.060 --> 12:37.740]  No, I got it, man.
[12:38.700 --> 12:40.680]  I know what Warming means.
[12:40.840 --> 12:42.060]  Tyler Soderstrom.
[12:43.280 --> 12:44.160]  Alvin Guzman.
[12:44.260 --> 12:44.680]  I'll pull that.
[12:44.740 --> 12:44.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:46.120 --> 12:47.860]  Jordan Walker and then...
[12:48.560 --> 12:49.080]  What are we looking at?
[12:50.860 --> 12:51.500]  Simon Muzziotti.
[12:51.680 --> 12:52.000]  Okay.
[12:52.160 --> 12:52.740]  I don't know who that is.
[12:52.860 --> 12:55.260]  You got a couple of good ones in there.
[12:55.380 --> 12:56.720]  Fucking Wander Franco in there.
[12:56.820 --> 12:58.020]  Yeah, that's not bad.
[12:58.240 --> 12:59.300]  I'm gonna put that to the middle.
[13:00.320 --> 13:01.260]  Just to keep it safe?
[13:01.360 --> 13:01.500]  Yeah.
[13:01.640 --> 13:01.800]  Good.
[13:02.100 --> 13:02.340]  Smart.
[13:02.400 --> 13:03.120]  So I sleeve it up.
[13:03.200 --> 13:03.600]  Yeah, decent.
[13:03.880 --> 13:04.120]  All right.
[13:05.140 --> 13:07.180]  Next, I think, Eric, we should get a little whimsical.
[13:07.440 --> 13:08.740]  Let's open some Free Willy 2.
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.880]  Free Willy 2, the adventure home.
[13:11.160 --> 13:12.020]  Yeah, I saw these.
[13:12.140 --> 13:13.240]  Somebody mentioned them on Reddit.
[13:13.240 --> 13:13.760]  Uh-huh.
[13:13.800 --> 13:17.940]  Or on social media that they saw them in a store and I got curious about them.
[13:18.080 --> 13:18.340]  Uh-huh.
[13:18.360 --> 13:19.160]  So I bought them.
[13:19.280 --> 13:21.680]  I don't think I've seen Free Willy 2.
[13:22.020 --> 13:22.060]  No.
[13:22.060 --> 13:24.280]  Because I'm in my, like, mid-30s.
[13:24.500 --> 13:24.520]  Yeah.
[13:24.780 --> 13:26.420]  So I missed it.
[13:26.680 --> 13:27.060]  I saw the first one.
[13:27.060 --> 13:28.540]  There was a huge fire.
[13:29.280 --> 13:30.000]  Huge fire.
[13:30.320 --> 13:30.680]  Oh.
[13:30.840 --> 13:31.100]  Huge fire.
[13:31.140 --> 13:32.960]  That's the scene where the water's on fire.
[13:33.820 --> 13:34.800]  Orcas in the wild.
[13:35.140 --> 13:37.680]  Yeah, that's... those are probably the scariest animal.
[13:37.820 --> 13:38.760]  Yeah, I would think.
[13:39.160 --> 13:39.920]  I would not want to be friends with an orca.
[13:39.980 --> 13:41.460]  Here's a... color that in.
[13:42.100 --> 13:45.640]  That looks like every cartoon that was on Fox in the 90s.
[13:46.060 --> 13:47.180]  That's really incredible.
[13:47.440 --> 13:48.320]  No escape.
[13:50.160 --> 13:51.100]  He's fucking trapped.
[13:51.240 --> 13:51.960]  That's where they die?
[13:52.020 --> 13:52.460]  Yeah, they die.
[13:52.740 --> 13:53.120]  Oh, no.
[13:53.940 --> 13:54.120]  Man.
[13:54.680 --> 13:55.260]  Oh, there's a good one.
[13:55.520 --> 13:55.840]  Draw!
[13:56.260 --> 13:57.900]  He's about to shoot that fucking whale.
[13:58.400 --> 13:58.880]  Look at that.
[13:58.900 --> 13:59.740]  He's got a gun and everything.
[14:00.760 --> 14:01.280]  I like that one.
[14:02.440 --> 14:04.380]  Those whales, like, are destructive.
[14:04.540 --> 14:06.340]  Like, they're, like, monstrous.
[14:06.720 --> 14:06.800]  Huge.
[14:06.800 --> 14:09.260]  They just, like, yeah, just, like, just run through shit.
[14:09.360 --> 14:09.580]  Yeah.
[14:09.740 --> 14:10.960]  Like a whale in a china shop.
[14:10.960 --> 14:11.860]  As they say.
[14:12.280 --> 14:13.060]  Tip over boats.
[14:13.160 --> 14:13.820]  They just do whatever.
[14:14.400 --> 14:14.780]  They're whales.
[14:14.860 --> 14:15.560]  They can do anything.
[14:16.320 --> 14:16.880]  They don't give a fuck.
[14:16.980 --> 14:17.160]  No.
[14:17.320 --> 14:18.100]  Why would they give a fuck?
[14:18.140 --> 14:18.500]  They're whales.
[14:18.700 --> 14:19.800]  They're way bigger than everything else.
[14:20.020 --> 14:21.920]  Kings of the sea, they call them.
[14:21.940 --> 14:22.280]  That's right.
[14:22.520 --> 14:23.780]  You said I, and then you said they.
[14:24.620 --> 14:25.420]  This thing's heating up.
[14:27.860 --> 14:28.860]  Get to that later.
[14:29.000 --> 14:29.300]  Okay.
[14:29.780 --> 14:31.100]  Let's open up some mail, Eric.
[14:31.160 --> 14:31.400]  Okay.
[14:31.520 --> 14:32.880]  From time to time, people send us mail.
[14:33.000 --> 14:34.920]  I think this is from Sean G.
[14:35.120 --> 14:36.160]  Let me not show his... okay.
[14:36.260 --> 14:36.620]  Thanks, man.
[14:37.120 --> 14:37.760]  Sean G.
[14:37.960 --> 14:39.120]  Sent us a whole box of crap.
[14:39.220 --> 14:40.180]  Let's see what crap is.
[14:40.860 --> 14:42.480]  It's so many packs.
[14:42.660 --> 14:46.560]  We're going to have to feed the pack sack, but there's also just a lot in there.
[14:47.000 --> 14:47.660]  You believe that?
[14:48.120 --> 14:48.220]  Sean.
[14:48.720 --> 14:49.760]  Sean just went for it.
[14:49.880 --> 14:50.400]  I feel terrible.
[14:50.540 --> 14:51.260]  We didn't give you anything.
[14:51.360 --> 14:52.080]  Yeah, here's the thing.
[14:52.660 --> 14:54.540]  You guys are welcome to send cards.
[14:54.940 --> 14:55.780]  It's totally fine.
[14:56.120 --> 14:56.440]  You can.
[14:56.760 --> 14:59.680]  Do not feel like you have to or you're like, oh, I have all these things.
[14:59.720 --> 15:00.280]  I should send it in.
[15:00.500 --> 15:01.900]  You can open your own cards.
[15:02.040 --> 15:03.020]  That's what cards are for.
[15:03.380 --> 15:05.020]  So that's fine.
[15:05.140 --> 15:05.640]  Keep your cards.
[15:05.800 --> 15:08.240]  But if you want to send them, fuck face freak shit.
[15:08.460 --> 15:08.740]  Hang on.
[15:10.180 --> 15:11.060]  What the fuck?
[15:11.340 --> 15:12.140]  Face break shit.
[15:12.500 --> 15:13.300]  Care of Eric Badour.
[15:13.500 --> 15:15.300]  1901 East 51st Street, Austin, Texas.
[15:16.440 --> 15:16.800]  78723.
[15:17.100 --> 15:20.360]  It's the way we sort them and organize them and then get them to you on the air.
[15:20.760 --> 15:21.360]  There's a lot here.
[15:21.800 --> 15:23.460]  This, uh, it's tuned to my biometrics.
[15:23.500 --> 15:25.740]  That was, I pressed it and nothing happened.
[15:26.780 --> 15:29.400]  Let's, uh, first off, let's feed the pack sack.
[15:29.580 --> 15:29.720]  All right.
[15:29.740 --> 15:32.200]  We'll put the prism rasslin' in.
[15:32.520 --> 15:33.820]  Are you familiar with WWE?
[15:35.060 --> 15:35.860]  I am familiar.
[15:36.200 --> 15:36.600]  All right.
[15:36.660 --> 15:38.060]  Do you know who Roman Reigns is?
[15:38.240 --> 15:38.380]  I do.
[15:38.480 --> 15:38.980]  And Becky Lynch?
[15:39.040 --> 15:39.420]  I do.
[15:39.520 --> 15:40.120]  Are they your favorites?
[15:40.120 --> 15:42.260]  No, they're like the top people.
[15:42.660 --> 15:43.400]  They're the top people?
[15:43.540 --> 15:44.480]  Yeah, those are like the top two.
[15:45.680 --> 15:47.120]  Those are the people who draw money.
[15:47.380 --> 15:49.200]  Who's the chase card in rasslin'?
[15:49.200 --> 15:52.380]  Um, we're gonna say it's Matt Riddle.
[15:52.680 --> 15:53.220]  Matt Riddle.
[15:53.340 --> 15:53.520]  Yep.
[15:53.660 --> 15:54.000]  Hell yeah.
[15:54.180 --> 15:56.340]  He's a UFC guy and he has a big mushroom tattooed on his side.
[15:56.400 --> 15:56.800]  He's weird.
[15:58.140 --> 15:58.940]  Trent Seven.
[15:59.300 --> 16:00.400]  Oh, wow.
[16:00.800 --> 16:01.140]  All right.
[16:01.800 --> 16:02.600]  What's the deal with him?
[16:02.720 --> 16:03.720]  Oh, he's a UK guy.
[16:04.700 --> 16:06.820]  That's the least Eric's ever had to say about a wrestler.
[16:07.080 --> 16:07.600]  Brawn Breaker.
[16:07.600 --> 16:10.980]  This guy, I don't know if you remember early 90s wrestling, the Steiner Brothers.
[16:11.220 --> 16:13.220]  This is Rick Steiner's son.
[16:13.620 --> 16:14.160]  He is...
[16:14.160 --> 16:14.880]  Oh, Rick Steiner.
[16:14.940 --> 16:16.480]  Yeah, you would think that they would just...
[16:16.480 --> 16:16.800]  He always wore the chin strap.
[16:16.860 --> 16:17.020]  Yep.
[16:17.220 --> 16:18.080]  Yeah, on the side.
[16:18.100 --> 16:21.460]  And that's his kid and he's jacked as fuck.
[16:21.620 --> 16:22.380]  And he's insane.
[16:22.500 --> 16:23.240]  He's huge.
[16:23.420 --> 16:26.040]  Did he do Greco-Roman wrestling as well?
[16:26.120 --> 16:29.800]  He played football and I think that he probably played...
[16:29.800 --> 16:31.100]  I think he's probably a wrestler in college.
[16:31.280 --> 16:31.720]  Okay, nice.
[16:31.840 --> 16:32.340]  He plays fight ball.
[16:32.460 --> 16:32.820]  Yeah, now...
[16:34.520 --> 16:34.880]  Undertaker.
[16:35.860 --> 16:37.740]  That's the fucking dumbest card.
[16:38.100 --> 16:39.620]  I feel like we have to pull that.
[16:39.700 --> 16:43.200]  I feel like this is a card that Andrew would have a lot to say about.
[16:43.340 --> 16:43.520]  Yeah.
[16:43.740 --> 16:45.200]  Like, it's just an outline.
[16:45.240 --> 16:46.880]  It's like hardly even a card.
[16:47.180 --> 16:48.520]  It's just an outline.
[16:49.040 --> 16:49.640]  Oh, man.
[16:49.860 --> 16:50.260]  Boy.
[16:50.360 --> 16:50.720]  Oh, shit.
[16:50.900 --> 16:51.660]  Jinder Mahal.
[16:51.940 --> 16:53.120]  Hey, cool.
[16:53.120 --> 16:53.280]  Do we know?
[16:53.460 --> 16:54.260]  Look at this, it's chrome.
[16:54.720 --> 16:57.160]  Former WWE Champion, Jinder Mahal.
[16:57.540 --> 16:57.900]  Former...
[16:57.900 --> 16:59.140]  How long was he champion for?
[16:59.180 --> 17:00.560]  Probably about four months.
[17:00.820 --> 17:01.060]  Really?
[17:01.200 --> 17:01.460]  Yeah.
[17:01.680 --> 17:02.580]  Didn't defend it for very long?
[17:03.040 --> 17:05.340]  No, and has not been at the top of the card since.
[17:05.360 --> 17:06.300]  Ooh, I wonder why.
[17:06.400 --> 17:07.280]  Low card guy.
[17:07.760 --> 17:08.220]  That's okay.
[17:08.440 --> 17:09.560]  That's what they say, low card guy?
[17:09.640 --> 17:10.520]  Eh, like, you know.
[17:10.880 --> 17:11.660]  Yeah, exactly.
[17:11.960 --> 17:12.620]  Low on the card guy.
[17:12.620 --> 17:13.320]  Okay, I'll trust you.
[17:13.380 --> 17:13.480]  Yeah.
[17:13.640 --> 17:16.680]  Here we're going to open up a pack of Panini 2122 Donners.
[17:16.760 --> 17:18.440]  I've opened up so much of this at home.
[17:18.520 --> 17:20.220]  Panini cards good cards or...
[17:20.640 --> 17:21.680]  Pretty much everything's Panini.
[17:22.980 --> 17:24.420]  But yeah, Panini are tops.
[17:26.420 --> 17:27.060]  What do we got?
[17:27.140 --> 17:27.520]  Panini is good.
[17:27.620 --> 17:27.920]  These are...
[17:27.920 --> 17:30.780]  This is like low end, but it's one up from Hoops.
[17:30.780 --> 17:34.000]  Hoops is like the do-do-ist, and then you get to...
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.520]  Then Donners is like bog standard.
[17:36.240 --> 17:37.840]  Anthony Edwards, second year card.
[17:37.900 --> 17:38.040]  Yeah.
[17:38.240 --> 17:38.980]  Fantastic player.
[17:39.660 --> 17:41.000]  Future of the NBA right there.
[17:41.400 --> 17:43.860]  Buddy Heald, people used to say that about him.
[17:44.180 --> 17:45.660]  Zion Williamson, people used to say that about him.
[17:48.280 --> 17:49.420]  PJ Washington Jr.
[17:50.100 --> 17:53.560]  Jay Crowder, I have a feeling he might be going somewhere in this offseason.
[17:53.920 --> 17:57.320]  Trey Young, now the official villain of the NBA.
[17:57.560 --> 17:58.020]  Oh yeah?
[17:58.080 --> 18:00.100]  He's accepted and loves the role.
[18:00.100 --> 18:02.740]  Gary Trent Jr., he's a junior.
[18:03.440 --> 18:04.200]  Who's dad, Gary Trent?
[18:04.440 --> 18:05.480]  Yeah, who's dad's Gary Trent.
[18:05.960 --> 18:06.480]  Here we go.
[18:06.540 --> 18:07.720]  LaMelo Ball, complete.
[18:08.260 --> 18:08.980]  That's probably a good...
[18:08.980 --> 18:09.580]  Wow.
[18:09.820 --> 18:12.060]  The whole LaMelo Ball in the one card?
[18:12.260 --> 18:13.240]  Can I say something about LaMelo Ball?
[18:13.320 --> 18:13.560]  Yep.
[18:13.660 --> 18:14.480]  Oh, please.
[18:14.700 --> 18:15.580]  He's funny on TV.
[18:15.680 --> 18:16.520]  He is funny on TV.
[18:16.520 --> 18:18.060]  His TV commercials are very good.
[18:18.060 --> 18:22.400]  I think that he is great as a personality.
[18:22.620 --> 18:22.820]  Yeah.
[18:23.560 --> 18:24.000]  And...
[18:24.000 --> 18:24.780]  Absolutely now.
[18:25.300 --> 18:27.360]  I think he found his niche.
[18:27.460 --> 18:27.800]  Same time.
[18:28.600 --> 18:29.200]  It is not a pull.
[18:29.340 --> 18:29.500]  Yeah.
[18:29.500 --> 18:32.320]  This is sad because Mike's not here.
[18:32.400 --> 18:33.300]  Nick's running the soundboard.
[18:33.600 --> 18:36.160]  And usually what happens is we start opening these cards.
[18:36.340 --> 18:39.820]  And when there's a former UT player, just from in the shadows,
[18:39.980 --> 18:42.760]  you see Mike's hand go up because he holds up the horns.
[18:44.440 --> 18:45.800]  We don't have Andrew.
[18:46.200 --> 18:47.120]  You and I are going to...
[18:47.120 --> 18:49.000]  We're going to suffer through some hockey together.
[18:49.740 --> 18:50.220]  Oh.
[18:51.000 --> 18:51.480]  Oh.
[18:52.440 --> 18:53.140]  Never mind.
[18:53.500 --> 18:54.100]  We have Andrew.
[18:55.100 --> 18:56.740]  That Andrew contributes about as much.
[18:56.780 --> 18:57.240]  That's interesting.
[18:57.500 --> 18:58.180]  What is cheating?
[19:00.360 --> 19:02.080]  There's so many cards.
[19:02.100 --> 19:03.180]  Oh yeah, they're all going to be hard.
[19:03.200 --> 19:05.160]  Why would you open this pack?
[19:05.240 --> 19:07.200]  We don't know anything about this sport.
[19:07.240 --> 19:09.060]  Jamie Oleksiak, he does.
[19:09.760 --> 19:10.840]  Nick Paul.
[19:11.580 --> 19:12.300]  He's a...
[19:12.300 --> 19:12.700]  Go ahead.
[19:13.300 --> 19:15.080]  Not related to the other players.
[19:16.020 --> 19:17.060]  Dimitri Orlov.
[19:17.140 --> 19:17.680]  I've heard that name.
[19:18.680 --> 19:19.800]  Linus Ulmark.
[19:21.460 --> 19:22.580]  Anthony Dulcolax.
[19:24.700 --> 19:25.500]  Close enough.
[19:25.680 --> 19:25.940]  Boy.
[19:26.480 --> 19:27.200]  Ryan Miller.
[19:27.340 --> 19:28.880]  There's so many cards, Geoff.
[19:28.880 --> 19:30.480]  Casey Middlestat.
[19:30.680 --> 19:31.100]  Sucks.
[19:32.520 --> 19:33.360]  Kyle Oxypoxy.
[19:34.900 --> 19:35.740]  Sam Gagner.
[19:36.000 --> 19:37.040]  Oh shit, Sam Gagner!
[19:37.440 --> 19:38.240]  We've done him before.
[19:38.660 --> 19:39.240]  We like them.
[19:39.420 --> 19:40.660]  We had Gagner, Gagner, and Gagney.
[19:40.740 --> 19:41.420]  They were a law firm.
[19:41.620 --> 19:41.780]  Remember?
[19:42.880 --> 19:43.300]  No.
[19:43.860 --> 19:45.460]  Is that the rules to hockey?
[19:47.880 --> 19:49.580]  That's a bunch of names we also don't know.
[19:50.460 --> 19:51.300]  Cole Lind.
[19:51.780 --> 19:54.400]  He's a rookie, I guess, in French.
[19:54.480 --> 19:56.220]  So we'll save that for who knows.
[19:56.820 --> 19:58.060]  There's whatever the fuck that is.
[19:58.060 --> 20:00.700]  Oh shit, it's Jake Bean.
[20:02.640 --> 20:03.860]  Everybody loves...
[20:03.860 --> 20:05.380]  Great hockey name, Jake Bean.
[20:06.280 --> 20:09.240]  Oh shit, it's Jake Bean.
[20:09.700 --> 20:10.780]  Calvin DeHaan.
[20:11.760 --> 20:13.020]  Adam Larson.
[20:14.040 --> 20:15.840]  Jacob spelled stupid.
[20:16.780 --> 20:17.420]  Zborl.
[20:18.520 --> 20:20.140]  J-A-K-U-B.
[20:20.540 --> 20:21.620]  I don't think...
[20:21.620 --> 20:23.520]  I don't think maybe he's from here, man.
[20:24.140 --> 20:26.340]  Where he's from, they spelled Jacob stupid.
[20:26.780 --> 20:27.580]  Kirby Datch.
[20:27.580 --> 20:29.700]  Mark Stone.
[20:31.980 --> 20:33.020]  Johnny Guh.
[20:34.740 --> 20:35.760]  Oh, Gudro.
[20:36.940 --> 20:37.680]  Uh, nailed it.
[20:37.960 --> 20:39.440]  Dominic Kubalik.
[20:40.160 --> 20:41.440]  The Barclays Center.
[20:44.340 --> 20:46.100]  J.T. Miller, wasn't that guy on...
[20:46.560 --> 20:47.600]  Wasn't he a comedian?
[20:47.940 --> 20:49.900]  Yeah, he was in Transformers.
[20:50.000 --> 20:50.320]  Not anymore.
[20:50.540 --> 20:51.060]  Yeah, not anymore.
[20:51.440 --> 20:52.700]  Philip Forsberg.
[20:53.160 --> 20:54.200]  Ian Mitchell.
[20:55.580 --> 20:55.940]  P.K.
[20:56.640 --> 20:57.160]  Subban.
[20:57.160 --> 20:59.560]  That would be funny if you watched Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.
[20:59.720 --> 21:00.920]  That's how Dorit says her name.
[21:01.140 --> 21:01.520]  I'm not gonna cheat.
[21:01.980 --> 21:02.060]  Cool.
[21:03.260 --> 21:04.140]  Patrick Moran.
[21:05.300 --> 21:06.700]  He's a real Moran, that guy.
[21:08.140 --> 21:09.000]  What a maroon!
[21:09.080 --> 21:10.280]  That card's saying maroon?
[21:10.440 --> 21:10.840]  What a maroon!
[21:11.100 --> 21:11.440]  Just making sure.
[21:11.840 --> 21:12.140]  Cool, man.
[21:12.900 --> 21:13.780]  Christopher Tenev.
[21:14.720 --> 21:14.900]  And...
[21:14.900 --> 21:16.300]  And fucking finally.
[21:16.380 --> 21:18.020]  And Bernie's cousin, Brent Burns.
[21:21.520 --> 21:22.440]  We're gonna save that.
[21:22.520 --> 21:23.240]  Founder of the company.
[21:24.500 --> 21:25.420]  Cousin of Burns.
[21:27.580 --> 21:27.860]  Really?
[21:30.860 --> 21:32.820]  Let's continue with shit we don't know about and talk about soccer.
[21:33.220 --> 21:33.500]  Why?
[21:34.460 --> 21:35.580]  Yeah, we got some tops.
[21:37.300 --> 21:39.100]  We're like the only two sports guys...
[21:39.100 --> 21:40.480]  Like, this is Gavin's wheelhouse.
[21:40.560 --> 21:41.580]  The other one was Andrew's.
[21:41.600 --> 21:42.320]  Okay, I can do a little...
[21:42.320 --> 21:42.780]  I can do some...
[21:42.780 --> 21:43.660]  I can do some soccer talk.
[21:43.760 --> 21:43.960]  Hold on.
[21:44.140 --> 21:46.840]  Unless any of these guys are Austin FC, I got nothing for you, bud.
[21:46.920 --> 21:47.820]  Stars aligned in Paris.
[21:47.940 --> 21:48.540]  All right, so no.
[21:48.980 --> 21:50.260]  Here's Lucas Ocampos.
[21:51.180 --> 21:52.440]  Here's Sergio Basquiat.
[21:54.220 --> 21:54.500]  Here's...
[21:54.500 --> 21:54.740]  Koke.
[21:56.540 --> 21:57.200]  What's his name?
[21:57.280 --> 21:57.500]  Koke.
[21:58.640 --> 21:59.420]  We'll save him.
[22:01.120 --> 22:02.380]  Here's Youssef Demir.
[22:02.840 --> 22:03.680]  He used to be Cat Stevens.
[22:03.780 --> 22:04.520]  Changed his name to Youssef.
[22:04.600 --> 22:05.740]  No, no, no, no.
[22:05.760 --> 22:06.120]  He did.
[22:06.280 --> 22:07.380]  No, I know.
[22:09.440 --> 22:10.080]  That's just not him.
[22:10.380 --> 22:11.480]  That's a parallel.
[22:11.700 --> 22:11.960]  Nope.
[22:12.280 --> 22:12.560]  Okay.
[22:12.980 --> 22:13.240]  Great.
[22:16.320 --> 22:19.440]  I read a really interesting article about how he ended up doing the soundtrack to Herald of Mud.
[22:20.080 --> 22:21.320]  And now look at him playing soccer.
[22:22.140 --> 22:22.820]  Oh, here you go.
[22:22.840 --> 22:23.440]  So here's what I can do.
[22:23.920 --> 22:24.740]  Dortmund's duo.
[22:24.980 --> 22:29.460]  That is Borussia Dortmund or BVB from the German Bundesliga.
[22:29.660 --> 22:31.020]  German's professional soccer team.
[22:31.140 --> 22:36.040]  I know that because I shared an office with a guy who was a professional soccer player for that team
[22:36.040 --> 22:37.060]  at 17.
[22:37.280 --> 22:41.460]  An American who got bought by a team, dropped out of high school, went over to Germany,
[22:41.540 --> 22:43.960]  became a professional soccer player, went up for a header.
[22:44.560 --> 22:47.960]  They got hit by a player, had his back wrapped around the goalpost,
[22:48.200 --> 22:50.340]  snapped his back in half, ended his career.
[22:50.440 --> 22:50.740]  17.
[22:52.220 --> 22:53.520]  Oh my god!
[22:54.180 --> 22:55.000]  I told you I could talk soccer.
[22:57.200 --> 22:58.740]  You can mark that for a social clip.
[22:58.940 --> 22:59.520]  That'd be a good one.
[23:03.320 --> 23:06.160]  That's an insane story I've never heard.
[23:06.340 --> 23:06.500]  Yeah.
[23:06.800 --> 23:08.080]  What the fuck?
[23:08.160 --> 23:08.600]  Gus knows him.
[23:08.640 --> 23:09.420]  He was like in our friend group.
[23:09.720 --> 23:10.800]  He was one of our best friends.
[23:11.480 --> 23:12.700]  He worked at the call center?
[23:13.140 --> 23:13.420]  Yeah.
[23:13.680 --> 23:14.240]  Are you serious?
[23:14.340 --> 23:15.120]  He managed it with me.
[23:15.340 --> 23:17.480]  He's the one that told me I could never work there again if I couldn't.
[23:19.580 --> 23:21.460]  He's like, if you leave this, you're leaving it for good.
[23:21.540 --> 23:22.500]  I'll never hire you back.
[23:22.580 --> 23:22.860]  We gotta get him.
[23:23.220 --> 23:24.060]  Okay, I'll take that risk.
[23:24.080 --> 23:24.920]  Get this guy on Android.
[23:24.960 --> 23:27.460]  I love... he's also very, very, very funny.
[23:27.520 --> 23:27.760]  Okay.
[23:27.960 --> 23:28.700]  Very naturally funny.
[23:28.880 --> 23:29.100]  Man.
[23:29.900 --> 23:30.960]  Brian, good one.
[23:31.040 --> 23:31.400]  All right.
[23:31.640 --> 23:32.640]  Ooh, I like these cards.
[23:32.800 --> 23:33.700]  Brandon Nemo.
[23:33.820 --> 23:35.040]  Yeah, these are like old-timey looking.
[23:36.560 --> 23:37.200]  Tijuan Walker.
[23:37.400 --> 23:37.980]  Taiwan Walker.
[23:38.080 --> 23:38.480]  Yeah, there you go.
[23:39.260 --> 23:39.900]  Lance Lyons.
[23:40.660 --> 23:41.340]  Tomato, tomato.
[23:41.460 --> 23:42.000]  Yeah, Lance Lynn.
[23:42.180 --> 23:43.320]  Jerry Sanchez.
[23:43.380 --> 23:43.620]  Okay.
[23:45.520 --> 23:46.200]  Oh, here we go.
[23:46.340 --> 23:46.480]  Yep.
[23:47.180 --> 23:49.200]  Swanson's Blast ties it in the seven.
[23:49.800 --> 23:52.420]  His name is Dansby Swanson.
[23:52.680 --> 23:53.400]  Dansby Swanson, yeah.
[23:53.400 --> 23:54.920]  That is a baseball name.
[23:55.160 --> 23:56.000]  Jazz Chisholm.
[23:56.700 --> 23:57.500]  It's also a frozen dinner name.
[23:57.520 --> 23:58.160]  It is.
[23:58.740 --> 24:02.100]  Jazz Chisholm and Dansby Swanson, I think, are two of my favorite baseball names right now.
[24:02.120 --> 24:03.120]  I like Jazz Chisholm a lot.
[24:03.200 --> 24:03.620]  Yeah, it's a good one.
[24:03.800 --> 24:04.700]  He's my current favorite name.
[24:06.520 --> 24:07.280]  Tony Santalan.
[24:07.500 --> 24:07.980]  Got it.
[24:08.360 --> 24:08.500]  Yeah.
[24:10.920 --> 24:13.140]  Isaiah is either catching or sliding.
[24:13.260 --> 24:15.020]  They call him IKF.
[24:15.020 --> 24:16.220]  Jordan Luplo.
[24:16.900 --> 24:17.620]  Or Looplo.
[24:19.040 --> 24:20.180]  I hate that guy.
[24:20.480 --> 24:21.120]  You don't like that guy?
[24:21.220 --> 24:23.600]  He has a diamond back and you just see him all year and you just go,
[24:23.680 --> 24:24.680]  this fucking guy again.
[24:24.920 --> 24:25.660]  This fucking this dude.
[24:25.680 --> 24:28.720]  To me, that was Paul Goldschmidt before he left with a diamond back.
[24:28.820 --> 24:29.300]  Controversial, that Paul Goldschmidt.
[24:29.300 --> 24:31.580]  You just see Paul Goldschmidt all the fucking time.
[24:32.140 --> 24:33.140]  How much time do we got left?
[24:34.480 --> 24:36.060]  Let's say two hours.
[24:36.400 --> 24:36.640]  Whoa.
[24:36.920 --> 24:37.780]  Well, about...
[24:37.780 --> 24:38.660]  We still have...
[24:38.660 --> 24:41.220]  I mean, we can go until three.
[24:41.480 --> 24:42.760]  So we got an hour and a half still.
[24:43.300 --> 24:43.980]  So we got tons of time.
[24:43.980 --> 24:45.320]  Baby, we got tons of time.
[24:45.340 --> 24:45.720]  How about this?
[24:45.960 --> 24:46.060]  Yeah.
[24:46.140 --> 24:46.980]  How long have we been going for?
[24:47.380 --> 24:47.680]  Half hour?
[24:47.720 --> 24:48.000]  Half hour.
[24:48.440 --> 24:48.600]  Okay.
[24:49.820 --> 24:50.340]  Why? What are you doing?
[24:50.620 --> 24:51.960]  I was just wondering when I want to pull other stuff out.
[24:51.960 --> 24:52.460]  You're going to make this...
[24:52.460 --> 24:52.960]  You're going to do this?
[24:53.000 --> 24:53.460]  You make it happen?
[24:54.320 --> 24:55.220]  I just want to show it off.
[24:55.340 --> 24:55.780]  Let's do it.
[24:55.860 --> 24:56.940]  Do we have a piece of paper or something?
[24:57.180 --> 25:03.340]  Oh, Leslie, our intrepid associate producer helped us out for this.
[25:04.020 --> 25:08.100]  She gave us very large yellow paper and normal size white paper.
[25:08.360 --> 25:12.900]  Gavin had on the main show a fantastic idea recently.
[25:13.000 --> 25:13.280]  Okay.
[25:13.280 --> 25:17.960]  His idea was that we should get actual Vancouver child kicker boots made.
[25:18.420 --> 25:21.240]  That then we could step in paint and then kick stuff.
[25:21.740 --> 25:23.300]  So we set about doing that.
[25:23.420 --> 25:26.860]  You said, and this is my favorite thing about you, you said, I'll look into it.
[25:26.940 --> 25:27.100]  Yep.
[25:27.220 --> 25:28.040]  And then I knew you were.
[25:28.620 --> 25:30.980]  It turns out we couldn't feasibly get that done.
[25:31.360 --> 25:33.420]  Getting a boot made.
[25:33.460 --> 25:33.660]  Yeah.
[25:34.060 --> 25:34.320]  Tough.
[25:34.740 --> 25:39.080]  But we were able to get a facsimile of a boot made.
[25:40.140 --> 25:40.480]  If you can...
[25:40.480 --> 25:41.500]  Here, I'll move it up to the thing.
[25:43.600 --> 25:44.620]  Look at this.
[25:44.740 --> 25:50.200]  This is the official Vancouver child kicker boot stamp.
[25:51.020 --> 25:51.180]  Yeah.
[25:51.360 --> 25:54.820]  See on this side, we've got a full size 10 and a half.
[25:54.940 --> 25:56.720]  This is the full boot stamp made.
[25:56.880 --> 25:59.680]  This show is insane because we get stuff like this made.
[25:59.780 --> 26:06.120]  So now we can either just use it like this or we can build a contraption to put our feet in
[26:06.120 --> 26:08.980]  and get one flip and then we can kick stuff.
[26:09.380 --> 26:11.720]  We all really wanted Andrew to kick stuff.
[26:11.880 --> 26:12.020]  Yeah.
[26:12.020 --> 26:13.300]  But, uh...
[26:13.300 --> 26:14.360]  Are we going to give this thing a shot?
[26:14.400 --> 26:14.980]  I think we're going to give it a shot.
[26:14.980 --> 26:17.060]  This is going to be the first stamp we make with this.
[26:17.200 --> 26:17.820]  Yeah, the very first.
[26:17.920 --> 26:18.700]  This is pretty exciting.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  I've never seen it in person until about an hour ago.
[26:22.080 --> 26:22.820]  What are those?
[26:22.960 --> 26:23.440]  Oh, shit.
[26:24.280 --> 26:25.320]  It just got complicated.
[26:25.680 --> 26:26.460]  What is this?
[26:26.560 --> 26:27.140]  Stamp ink.
[26:28.360 --> 26:31.020]  Do we need to ink up the pad first?
[26:31.240 --> 26:32.020]  Let's find out.
[26:32.320 --> 26:33.140]  I have a feeling.
[26:33.260 --> 26:33.880]  Yes, we do.
[26:34.100 --> 26:35.100]  Oh, why?
[26:35.760 --> 26:37.120]  Why don't they put stuff together?
[26:38.060 --> 26:41.560]  Don't worry, we have interns here to help us ink pads.
[26:44.080 --> 26:45.520]  They're just going to be really careful.
[26:48.480 --> 26:50.160]  Oh, there's no... yeah, there's no ink on that.
[26:50.320 --> 26:51.880]  I've never seen an inkless pad before.
[26:51.880 --> 26:52.980]  Me neither, that's pretty interesting.
[26:53.100 --> 26:53.740]  This is just good for science.
[26:53.840 --> 26:54.100]  Look at that.
[26:54.140 --> 26:54.240]  Yeah.
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.560]  That's how they come before they're inked.
[26:56.600 --> 26:58.820]  This pad is shipped dry to prevent accidental leaking.
[26:59.260 --> 27:01.820]  The ink pad is perfect for extra large stamps.
[27:01.940 --> 27:02.500]  Yeah, no, I get it.
[27:02.840 --> 27:05.220]  The pad requires about three ounces of ink for initial setup.
[27:06.020 --> 27:08.980]  How much is... how much ounces is a 60 milliliters?
[27:10.140 --> 27:11.900]  I don't know if this fucking thing fits.
[27:12.420 --> 27:12.820]  What?
[27:13.720 --> 27:14.400]  Come on.
[27:16.180 --> 27:16.880]  Surely it will.
[27:17.420 --> 27:20.660]  It may take up for three hours for the ink to completely soak in.
[27:22.820 --> 27:24.540]  All right, well, we'll... you've seen it.
[27:24.860 --> 27:26.540]  We'll try it in like 45 minutes.
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.560]  Are we gonna... all right.
[27:28.660 --> 27:29.380]  Let's just ink her up.
[27:29.940 --> 27:30.600]  Let's set it off to the side.
[27:30.600 --> 27:31.080]  Here you go.
[27:32.180 --> 27:33.360]  We'll come back to that.
[27:34.540 --> 27:36.500]  Boy, I should have read that up earlier, huh?
[27:36.800 --> 27:37.920]  I believe in you guys.
[27:38.220 --> 27:38.560]  Hang on.
[27:38.560 --> 27:40.940]  2.02884.
[27:41.200 --> 27:41.320]  Good.
[27:41.540 --> 27:42.540]  Then only use one.
[27:43.040 --> 27:44.780]  That shows you how to do it on the back.
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.220]  This show sucks.
[27:49.380 --> 27:51.100]  I could say that about my whole career.
[27:52.620 --> 27:54.320]  Let's open two more packs of wrestlers.
[27:54.840 --> 27:55.180]  We like...
[27:55.180 --> 27:55.580]  Oh, cool.
[27:55.740 --> 27:56.260]  Let's do it.
[27:57.220 --> 28:00.460]  Hopefully you have some more interesting facts like he's British.
[28:00.740 --> 28:02.060]  Yeah, I mean, I like him.
[28:02.180 --> 28:03.740]  Mustache Mountain's a cool team.
[28:03.860 --> 28:04.820]  It's just, you know, he has nothing.
[28:05.060 --> 28:05.460]  Mustache Mountain?
[28:05.540 --> 28:08.000]  Yeah, he has mustache and he was a part of British drunk style
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.620]  with Pete Dunn and Tyler Bate.
[28:09.740 --> 28:11.120]  And they were in a group called Mustache Mountain.
[28:11.460 --> 28:13.520]  And it was just a rip off Peaky Blinders, but it was fun.
[28:14.120 --> 28:14.540]  Tyler Bate?
[28:14.620 --> 28:15.640]  Yeah, it's pretty cool, right?
[28:15.840 --> 28:16.100]  Yeah.
[28:16.220 --> 28:16.380]  Yep.
[28:17.420 --> 28:18.140]  Mustafa Ali.
[28:18.300 --> 28:21.340]  Mustafa Ali is a great professional wrestler.
[28:21.780 --> 28:24.540]  Wrestled with a friend of mine in Chicago for a while.
[28:24.560 --> 28:25.500]  And then got signed to WWE.
[28:25.900 --> 28:27.980]  Sat out for a while because he wasn't happy with where things were going.
[28:28.060 --> 28:29.640]  And now he's back, baby.
[28:30.540 --> 28:31.260]  In the WWE?
[28:31.460 --> 28:31.840]  Yes, sir.
[28:34.100 --> 28:34.820]  Broderick Strong.
[28:35.520 --> 28:36.240]  Broderick Strong.
[28:36.240 --> 28:39.160]  He's doing his infamous move, the Stronghold.
[28:39.900 --> 28:42.040]  He is the messiah of the backbreaker.
[28:42.520 --> 28:48.980]  He's a former PWG champion, former NXT United States...
[28:48.980 --> 28:51.920]  No, North American champion, former tag team champion.
[28:52.240 --> 28:55.560]  I've seen him wrestle live dozens of times.
[28:55.980 --> 28:58.380]  What is the messiah of the backbreaker?
[28:58.380 --> 29:05.200]  His gimmick on the indies in like 2005 was that everything he did was into like a backbreaker.
[29:05.200 --> 29:08.020]  So some day it would be like a guy throws a clothesline, he catches it,
[29:08.080 --> 29:09.360]  and then throws him into like a backbreaker.
[29:09.580 --> 29:11.660]  And it's just like everything he does is into a backbreaker.
[29:11.820 --> 29:12.740]  And it looks very cool.
[29:12.960 --> 29:14.060]  And he's strong as fuck.
[29:14.460 --> 29:15.360]  So he's a little guy.
[29:15.400 --> 29:16.180]  He's probably about my size.
[29:16.880 --> 29:17.600]  They're all like...
[29:17.600 --> 29:18.600]  That's wrestlers now.
[29:18.760 --> 29:21.420]  It's just nerds who grew up watching wrestling who are my size.
[29:21.640 --> 29:22.140]  And you go...
[29:22.140 --> 29:22.960]  But jacked as fuck.
[29:23.300 --> 29:24.280]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[29:24.340 --> 29:25.400]  Because they work out.
[29:27.420 --> 29:27.780]  Explain.
[29:29.520 --> 29:30.380]  Is that Primate?
[29:30.580 --> 29:30.820]  Yes.
[29:30.860 --> 29:33.740]  That guy's a guy from NXT UK.
[29:33.740 --> 29:41.240]  Just there was a time when WWE was buying up all of the UK talent because they're like,
[29:41.360 --> 29:43.040]  we're going to expand into the UK.
[29:43.040 --> 29:45.080]  And then that really backfired.
[29:45.140 --> 29:46.540]  And now they have a guy named Primate.
[29:47.720 --> 29:49.320]  It's like a Bane type thing.
[29:49.560 --> 29:51.140]  I mean, I think that's what they're going for.
[29:51.340 --> 29:55.280]  You could tell it's pro wrestling because he's wearing camo pants and a cool little mask.
[29:55.400 --> 29:57.940]  I'm going to say he looks British to me.
[29:58.300 --> 29:58.700]  Yes.
[29:59.180 --> 29:59.340]  Yeah.
[29:59.380 --> 30:00.840]  I don't know what it is about him.
[30:00.900 --> 30:02.100]  He looks like he's about to go...
[30:02.100 --> 30:02.940]  Yeah.
[30:04.000 --> 30:04.480]  Yeah.
[30:04.760 --> 30:04.960]  Yeah.
[30:05.360 --> 30:05.720]  Let's see.
[30:05.760 --> 30:06.200]  Yeah.
[30:06.500 --> 30:07.900]  And then Sasha Banks.
[30:07.980 --> 30:11.840]  Sasha Banks recently quit WWE for a second time.
[30:13.160 --> 30:15.680]  She, the rumor is that she's released now.
[30:16.020 --> 30:16.680]  We don't know.
[30:16.880 --> 30:17.500]  Nobody knows.
[30:17.660 --> 30:19.800]  The best part of pro wrestling is probably the gossip.
[30:21.120 --> 30:22.180]  What's the hot gossip these days?
[30:22.360 --> 30:23.300]  Her leaving.
[30:23.460 --> 30:25.760]  She walked out in the middle of Monday Night Raw.
[30:25.960 --> 30:28.620]  She's just like, because she wasn't happy with the direction of this stuff.
[30:28.620 --> 30:33.040]  So her and another woman, Naomi, both left and have not been on TV, haven't been posting
[30:33.500 --> 30:34.540]  on social media and stuff.
[30:34.660 --> 30:36.840]  But nobody knows if they're still contracted or not.
[30:36.960 --> 30:37.440]  Fucking cool.
[30:37.860 --> 30:38.840]  She's also Snoop Dogg's cousin.
[30:41.060 --> 30:41.460]  Yeah.
[30:45.340 --> 30:46.140]  Valentina Feroz?
[30:48.800 --> 30:50.800]  I have no idea who this is.
[30:51.680 --> 30:52.920]  Who the fuck is this?
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.200]  Oh, she's on NXT now.
[30:54.360 --> 30:55.120]  That's why I don't watch it.
[30:55.380 --> 30:55.620]  Sorry.
[30:56.440 --> 30:57.220]  Sam Stoker.
[30:58.540 --> 31:01.900]  Oh, this guy's one half of a tag team called Pretty Deadly.
[31:02.080 --> 31:04.240]  And their gimmick is they're very attractive.
[31:07.300 --> 31:08.460]  I think it's great.
[31:08.620 --> 31:09.520]  I think it's a great gimmick.
[31:09.640 --> 31:10.580]  Are they very attractive?
[31:10.660 --> 31:11.480]  I mean, look at him.
[31:11.560 --> 31:13.080]  He's a handsome, he's a handsome boy.
[31:13.280 --> 31:14.100]  Oh, he's also very British.
[31:14.900 --> 31:15.400]  You know what I mean?
[31:15.540 --> 31:17.780]  Like, yeah, like he's handsome for a British guy.
[31:17.860 --> 31:19.700]  So he's like, you know, he's like an Austin Sixx.
[31:21.220 --> 31:21.940]  James Drake.
[31:22.200 --> 31:23.480]  He's also a British guy.
[31:23.620 --> 31:26.020]  He's uh, I feel like this guy's half a year.
[31:26.120 --> 31:26.480]  I don't remember.
[31:26.480 --> 31:27.600]  I feel like he'd be an Austin Seven.
[31:27.860 --> 31:28.140]  Yeah.
[31:28.580 --> 31:29.100]  Yeah, I agree.
[31:29.800 --> 31:31.580]  And then, uh, oh, you know this dude.
[31:32.360 --> 31:35.240]  Uh, it's the, uh, uh, the Brawny Man.
[31:36.180 --> 31:36.500]  Right?
[31:36.840 --> 31:37.660]  Brock Lesnar's back.
[31:37.740 --> 31:40.040]  He's gonna wrestle Roman Reigns at SummerSlam.
[31:41.060 --> 31:42.200]  Roman Reigns is the number one guy.
[31:42.360 --> 31:42.860]  Yeah, he is.
[31:42.940 --> 31:44.800]  He's the champion and Brock Lesnar is gonna fight him.
[31:45.080 --> 31:45.660]  Do you think he'll win?
[31:46.300 --> 31:46.920]  I don't know.
[31:47.040 --> 31:47.440]  Probably not.
[31:47.520 --> 31:51.380]  I think, I think, I think Roman Reigns is gonna hold the title for a very long time.
[31:51.480 --> 31:53.720]  He's already had it for a very long time, but he's gonna hold it for even longer.
[31:54.040 --> 31:54.900]  Why do you think that is?
[31:55.320 --> 31:59.520]  They're trying to make, I think they want him to wrestle The Rock at WrestleMania.
[32:00.040 --> 32:01.200]  Oh, okay.
[32:01.380 --> 32:02.560]  I think that, because that's his cousin.
[32:02.680 --> 32:03.780]  The Rock's cousin is Roman Reigns.
[32:04.040 --> 32:04.660]  No shit.
[32:05.500 --> 32:08.420]  So I think that they want him to wrestle The Rock.
[32:09.260 --> 32:11.220]  And The Rock is, what, like 50?
[32:11.520 --> 32:15.160]  So that, and the last time he wrestled, he like tore everything out of his body.
[32:15.600 --> 32:16.100]  It was pretty bad.
[32:16.800 --> 32:17.200]  Did he really?
[32:17.360 --> 32:20.240]  Yeah, he like, he like tore like a rib, like totally off.
[32:20.300 --> 32:20.840]  Like it was bad.
[32:20.840 --> 32:25.960]  When you do human growth hormone, your muscles don't grow right.
[32:26.080 --> 32:28.540]  They just grow and then they tear really easily.
[32:28.540 --> 32:31.120]  Are you telling me The Rock does steroids?
[32:32.060 --> 32:33.740]  He's not 100% natural.
[32:36.080 --> 32:37.280]  Hey, fuckfacers.
[32:38.220 --> 32:40.380]  Glad you guys enjoyed the cards last stream.
[32:40.740 --> 32:42.580]  Found a few more cards I thought you'd enjoy.
[32:43.120 --> 32:44.720]  And here you'll find a classic white sock.
[32:45.220 --> 32:47.960]  Some of Eric's political and sports heroes.
[32:48.120 --> 32:49.900]  A familiar face in an unfamiliar uniform.
[32:49.900 --> 32:50.800]  What does that mean?
[32:51.060 --> 32:53.380]  And a pitcher who may have had the shittiest day at the ballpark ever.
[32:53.700 --> 32:54.200]  Love the show.
[32:54.320 --> 32:55.220]  Thanks for the years of content.
[32:55.340 --> 32:56.000]  Thanks, Joel.
[32:56.260 --> 32:58.020]  It's, uh, oh, thank you, Joel.
[32:58.700 --> 32:59.240]  Joel or Bear.
[32:59.420 --> 33:00.140]  He, um...
[33:00.140 --> 33:00.580]  Oh, he goes by.
[33:00.800 --> 33:02.740]  I don't know why he said my political...
[33:02.740 --> 33:03.220]  What is that?
[33:03.220 --> 33:03.780]  We're gonna find out.
[33:03.780 --> 33:04.500]  I don't know.
[33:04.720 --> 33:05.460]  This is scary.
[33:05.860 --> 33:06.260]  All right, here we go.
[33:06.440 --> 33:07.520]  Oh, this one's got a story.
[33:07.680 --> 33:07.940]  Ooh.
[33:08.400 --> 33:08.720]  Okay.
[33:10.340 --> 33:10.700]  He's...
[33:10.700 --> 33:14.920]  Joel is the guy who sent us the card of the guy who got caught jerking off in his car.
[33:15.440 --> 33:16.560]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:16.620 --> 33:16.800]  Yeah.
[33:17.060 --> 33:17.760]  Oh my god.
[33:17.780 --> 33:18.420]  Okay, hold on.
[33:18.420 --> 33:19.440]  Let me pull the card out first.
[33:19.540 --> 33:20.840]  And then Joel's got a whole story for us.
[33:20.940 --> 33:21.380]  Joel...
[33:21.380 --> 33:22.800]  Story time with Joel is really great.
[33:23.020 --> 33:23.660]  He's got a whole thing.
[33:23.920 --> 33:24.160]  Shit.
[33:24.580 --> 33:25.080]  I think you're okay.
[33:25.440 --> 33:25.960]  Oh, fuck.
[33:26.920 --> 33:27.280]  What's this?
[33:28.820 --> 33:30.660]  This is Archie Bradley.
[33:30.920 --> 33:31.280]  Okay.
[33:31.560 --> 33:31.880]  Okay.
[33:33.120 --> 33:38.500]  On May 5th, 2018, allegedly by Joel, I have no idea what I'm about to read.
[33:38.840 --> 33:40.800]  Archie Bradley ran desperately to the bathroom,
[33:41.080 --> 33:44.060]  seeking to free himself from the torment of an overfull bladder.
[33:44.460 --> 33:47.640]  Reaching the urinal just in time, he may have freed himself a bit too much,
[33:47.640 --> 33:50.660]  as to his dismay, he realized he just shit himself.
[33:51.160 --> 33:53.760]  As unfortunate as this is, the timing was worse.
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.660]  He was three minutes from pitching in the top of the sixth inning versus the Houston Astros.
[33:58.300 --> 33:59.080]  In his words...
[34:00.220 --> 34:02.880]  So it's a 2-2 count and I'm like, man, I have to pee.
[34:03.000 --> 34:03.860]  I have to go pee.
[34:04.100 --> 34:05.640]  So I run into our bathroom real quick.
[34:05.720 --> 34:08.380]  I'm ready to go and I'm trying to pee and I'm actually shitting my pants.
[34:08.780 --> 34:11.160]  Like right before I'm about to go in the game, I poop my pants.
[34:11.260 --> 34:12.500]  I'm like, oh my gosh.
[34:13.400 --> 34:14.280]  Oh my gosh.
[34:14.860 --> 34:16.900]  I know I'm a pitch away from going in the game.
[34:16.900 --> 34:18.540]  So I'm scrambling to clean myself up.
[34:18.620 --> 34:20.740]  I get it cleaned up as best as I can, butt my pants up.
[34:20.820 --> 34:23.480]  And our bullpen coach, Mike Fetters says, hey, you're in the game.
[34:23.620 --> 34:27.100]  So I'm jogging into the game to pitch with poop literally in my pants.
[34:27.460 --> 34:27.820]  No!
[34:29.120 --> 34:31.420]  But hey, he went out, got out of the inning without a run.
[34:31.460 --> 34:32.220]  So fuck the Astros.
[34:32.340 --> 34:32.440]  Yeah!
[34:34.640 --> 34:36.540]  Dude, Joel's like my new favorite.
[34:36.720 --> 34:37.960]  Joel, that's a great one.
[34:38.000 --> 34:38.780]  That is a great one.
[34:38.980 --> 34:40.460]  Yeah, probably mark that for a social clip.
[34:42.820 --> 34:44.780]  Archie Bradley shit his pants.
[34:46.900 --> 34:48.320]  I fucking hate the Diamondbacks.
[34:51.320 --> 34:52.040]  Oh man.
[34:52.440 --> 34:56.020]  Yeah, these are like, I ran into Joel on Twitter.
[34:56.280 --> 34:58.000]  Dude, you're fucking, you're not gonna believe this.
[34:58.020 --> 34:58.380]  Oh no.
[34:58.740 --> 35:01.040]  Ran into Joel on Twitter and he's just like, I want to send some stuff.
[35:01.100 --> 35:01.820]  And went, okay, cool.
[35:02.020 --> 35:03.080]  And he's a good dude.
[35:03.860 --> 35:04.880]  We got a garbage pail.
[35:06.560 --> 35:07.280]  Rapping Ron.
[35:07.520 --> 35:08.440]  I think that's your political.
[35:08.820 --> 35:10.240]  I think, I think this is right.
[35:10.320 --> 35:12.440]  So you remember when he got shot, right?
[35:12.640 --> 35:12.860]  Yeah.
[35:13.040 --> 35:13.940]  It was like that?
[35:13.940 --> 35:15.360]  It was about that, yeah.
[35:16.960 --> 35:17.840]  Henry Kissinger.
[35:17.840 --> 35:18.840]  What the fuck?
[35:19.200 --> 35:22.480]  We're just, these are just like war criminal cards?
[35:22.680 --> 35:23.140]  H-K-I.
[35:23.260 --> 35:24.520]  What the fuck?
[35:26.080 --> 35:27.220]  Oh shit, here we go.
[35:27.580 --> 35:28.180]  This is a White Hawk.
[35:29.240 --> 35:30.140]  I don't know if he was.
[35:30.320 --> 35:31.400]  Yeah, at that time.
[35:31.500 --> 35:32.460]  Paul Canerco auto.
[35:32.620 --> 35:33.780]  Oh, wow, really?
[35:34.100 --> 35:34.660]  He was first baseman.
[35:34.700 --> 35:35.960]  Dude, Paul Canerco, wow.
[35:36.280 --> 35:36.580]  This is shit, man.
[35:37.480 --> 35:38.260]  Oh, here we go.
[35:38.300 --> 35:40.820]  This is a little Dodgers for my girlfriend's dad.
[35:41.800 --> 35:42.580]  There's a fucking...
[35:43.100 --> 35:43.900]  Chris Taylor.
[35:43.960 --> 35:44.420]  Chris Taylor.
[35:44.900 --> 35:47.360]  That's a single patch card.
[35:47.500 --> 35:47.860]  A little jersey.
[35:48.420 --> 35:48.660]  That's cool.
[35:48.920 --> 35:50.100]  Oh, here you go.
[35:50.140 --> 35:50.780]  This is good for you.
[35:51.300 --> 35:55.040]  This is a Tony Gwynn with an authentic game used badge.
[35:55.040 --> 35:55.640]  Oh, wow.
[35:55.800 --> 35:56.940]  Yeah, that's really lovely.
[35:56.940 --> 35:57.320]  Wow.
[35:57.600 --> 35:59.840]  That's how he hit one of his 3,000 hits with that.
[36:00.100 --> 36:03.200]  And then speak of the fucking devil.
[36:03.440 --> 36:04.860]  Eric, boom.
[36:05.000 --> 36:05.680]  No way!
[36:05.880 --> 36:06.220]  Padre Zim.
[36:06.220 --> 36:07.060]  We got the Padre Zim!
[36:07.640 --> 36:08.860]  That's a Padre Zim right there.
[36:08.880 --> 36:09.360]  Awesome.
[36:09.600 --> 36:10.240]  Thanks to Joel.
[36:10.380 --> 36:10.820]  Joel!
[36:10.820 --> 36:13.980]  Just having a conversation about how we haven't seen a Padre Zim yet.
[36:14.220 --> 36:14.900]  Oh, wow.
[36:15.040 --> 36:15.960]  And there it is right there.
[36:16.220 --> 36:21.200]  If you're new to fuck, face, or face break shit,
[36:21.380 --> 36:24.980]  you should know that we are obsessed with and love all things...
[36:24.980 --> 36:26.000]  Wow, we got another...
[36:26.000 --> 36:27.180]  Wow, dude, that's a good Zim, too.
[36:27.400 --> 36:27.940]  That's a great Zim.
[36:28.100 --> 36:28.800]  It's in good shape, too.
[36:28.840 --> 36:29.040]  Yeah.
[36:29.600 --> 36:31.380]  A little Padre's Manager Zim action.
[36:32.540 --> 36:33.300]  Might get that graded.
[36:34.660 --> 36:35.020]  Yeah.
[36:35.480 --> 36:36.740]  I mean, they'll give it a 10 and...
[36:36.740 --> 36:37.780]  Bad cut on the back, but...
[36:37.780 --> 36:38.400]  They'll...
[36:38.900 --> 36:40.060]  They'll give it a 10 and then go...
[36:40.060 --> 36:40.840]  I mean, it's not worth anything.
[36:41.280 --> 36:41.360]  Yeah.
[36:42.380 --> 36:42.880]  After... shit.
[36:43.200 --> 36:45.380]  The Zimmer price has not completely gone back down.
[36:45.540 --> 36:46.760]  It's still elevated to where it's...
[36:46.760 --> 36:50.040]  I can't believe that we had an effect on the market like that.
[36:50.040 --> 36:50.520]  For a long time.
[36:50.520 --> 36:53.360]  I mean, you were saying that you were signing a lot of Zims when you were doing...
[36:53.360 --> 36:55.220]  I probably signed, yeah, at least 10 or 15.
[36:55.520 --> 36:55.880]  Wow.
[36:56.480 --> 36:57.220]  I would say when I was...
[36:57.220 --> 36:57.880]  That's insane.
[36:58.060 --> 36:58.940]  I'm gonna pull from the pack sack.
[36:59.180 --> 37:00.440]  Oh, we have RTX coming up.
[37:00.540 --> 37:01.520]  Bring a Zim to RTX.
[37:02.240 --> 37:02.600]  Hollywood...
[37:02.600 --> 37:06.860]  This is the Hollywood premiere set walk of fame trading cards.
[37:06.940 --> 37:07.620]  These suck.
[37:08.520 --> 37:10.020]  These cards suck.
[37:10.040 --> 37:10.760]  These are gonna be great.
[37:11.440 --> 37:12.440]  This is gonna be really good.
[37:12.440 --> 37:13.620]  We had these before.
[37:14.260 --> 37:16.060]  It's like the same 11 cards.
[37:16.280 --> 37:16.640]  I know.
[37:17.820 --> 37:18.980]  Edward G. Robinson.
[37:19.460 --> 37:19.920]  Yeah, see?
[37:22.940 --> 37:23.780]  Dinah Shore.
[37:23.980 --> 37:25.000]  What the fuck?
[37:26.500 --> 37:28.340]  Dinah Shore shows just before my time.
[37:29.420 --> 37:31.140]  As is Nanette Fabry.
[37:31.300 --> 37:31.580]  Wow.
[37:32.460 --> 37:33.080]  Oh, here we go.
[37:33.320 --> 37:34.140]  Vera Miles.
[37:35.220 --> 37:36.180]  We got...
[37:37.760 --> 37:38.500]  Johnny Cash.
[37:38.500 --> 37:39.380]  Johnny Cash.
[37:39.900 --> 37:40.300]  That's...
[37:40.300 --> 37:41.100]  Wow, poor...
[37:41.100 --> 37:42.560]  That's a terrible picture of that man.
[37:42.580 --> 37:43.260]  It's not a great photo.
[37:43.280 --> 37:43.980]  Oh, that's sad.
[37:44.100 --> 37:45.020]  Catherine Grayson.
[37:46.400 --> 37:47.340]  Oh, Clayton Moore.
[37:47.480 --> 37:50.100]  I guess he was the Lone Ranger back in the day.
[37:50.800 --> 37:51.700]  Oh, here we go.
[37:52.140 --> 37:52.880]  Charles Bronski.
[37:53.240 --> 37:54.000]  All right.
[37:54.400 --> 37:54.800]  I'm gonna pull that.
[37:54.800 --> 37:57.300]  I think he's definitely on the set of a Death Wish movie.
[37:57.580 --> 37:58.620]  Well, what else would he be?
[37:58.620 --> 37:58.900]  Yeah, right.
[37:59.360 --> 37:59.460]  Yeah.
[38:01.720 --> 38:02.520]  Sid Charisse.
[38:04.160 --> 38:06.180]  Oh, the gambler Kenny Rogers.
[38:06.220 --> 38:06.620]  Nice.
[38:06.620 --> 38:07.660]  Wearing a tall hat.
[38:07.720 --> 38:09.240]  You seen him and his giant sons?
[38:10.000 --> 38:10.180]  Yeah.
[38:10.340 --> 38:11.180]  His giant sons.
[38:11.240 --> 38:11.440]  Big sons.
[38:11.620 --> 38:12.520]  He had big ol' sons.
[38:12.640 --> 38:12.920]  Hey, Eric.
[38:13.080 --> 38:13.260]  Yeah.
[38:13.520 --> 38:14.340]  What's a Tim Conway?
[38:14.940 --> 38:15.660]  I like that.
[38:15.660 --> 38:16.400]  About 120 pounds.
[38:16.440 --> 38:16.880]  That's pretty good.
[38:17.700 --> 38:19.480]  And the queen diva herself, Angela.
[38:19.680 --> 38:20.040]  Beautiful.
[38:20.460 --> 38:21.580]  These were not terrible.
[38:21.800 --> 38:22.200]  Those were not terrible.
[38:22.200 --> 38:25.020]  Those are probably better than any other pack of those we've ever opened.
[38:25.060 --> 38:25.700]  Oh, yeah, easily.
[38:25.880 --> 38:27.100]  And they didn't stick together, which is nice.
[38:27.140 --> 38:27.840]  Yeah, that's...
[38:28.480 --> 38:29.600]  How much time do we have left?
[38:30.000 --> 38:30.680]  You keep...
[38:30.680 --> 38:33.920]  It's only been 10 minutes since the last time you asked me.
[38:34.320 --> 38:37.140]  Where do you think that box of cards I had is?
[38:37.640 --> 38:38.000]  What?
[38:38.800 --> 38:40.340]  What are you talking about?
[38:40.480 --> 38:45.700]  I had a box of 89 Fleer Complete Set that I was...
[38:45.700 --> 38:46.420]  Are they in your cars?
[38:47.960 --> 38:48.920]  Are they, though?
[38:49.180 --> 38:50.100]  Yeah, I bet they are.
[38:50.200 --> 38:50.480]  Oh, well.
[38:51.340 --> 38:53.220]  That's what I was going to use to burn this thing with.
[38:53.360 --> 38:53.760]  Oh, no.
[38:55.000 --> 38:55.940]  But here's what I can do.
[38:56.060 --> 38:56.220]  Yeah.
[38:56.340 --> 38:57.580]  I'll just do one for the hell of it.
[38:57.660 --> 38:58.060]  We'll do Tim Conway.
[38:58.080 --> 38:58.620]  Tim Conway!
[38:58.960 --> 39:00.820]  All right, so you want to explain what this thing is?
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.380]  Yeah, so this is a gold embosser.
[39:03.380 --> 39:03.960]  And so...
[39:04.700 --> 39:06.420]  This is crazy.
[39:06.780 --> 39:08.320]  What you do is you buy, like, foil.
[39:08.580 --> 39:09.860]  Like, gold foil like this.
[39:09.940 --> 39:10.600]  We Ian-ed it.
[39:10.620 --> 39:14.520]  And then you turn this guy on, find the appropriate temperature, superheat it,
[39:14.580 --> 39:17.160]  and then you put a brass plate of a design under it.
[39:17.500 --> 39:21.880]  I went to Etsy and I found a lovely lady who makes brass plates of things,
[39:21.920 --> 39:23.360]  and I had her make this design.
[39:23.480 --> 39:25.640]  So you have to, like, line it up a certain way?
[39:25.900 --> 39:27.740]  Yeah, it's actually quite hard to do upside down.
[39:28.020 --> 39:28.460]  Oh, great.
[39:28.840 --> 39:30.180]  I mean, you could turn it around.
[39:30.360 --> 39:30.840]  No, it's okay.
[39:32.220 --> 39:32.720]  You're right.
[39:33.600 --> 39:34.500]  No, yeah, you're right.
[39:36.560 --> 39:36.920]  Oh.
[39:37.860 --> 39:40.020]  We'll get it to about, is it 191 degrees?
[39:40.120 --> 39:40.620]  That's about right.
[39:40.660 --> 39:41.840]  That is absolutely right.
[39:41.920 --> 39:42.320]  This size.
[39:42.480 --> 39:42.680]  Okay.
[39:42.860 --> 39:45.980]  I find 155 degrees is the best for smaller sizes.
[39:46.380 --> 39:46.640]  Okay.
[39:46.860 --> 39:48.540]  I've done a lot of testing.
[39:48.740 --> 39:49.680]  There's a lot happening right now.
[39:49.980 --> 39:51.280]  And you pour the...
[39:51.280 --> 39:52.160]  Well, let's get further.
[39:54.860 --> 39:56.300]  I don't know what you need.
[39:57.980 --> 39:59.100]  A cutting tool.
[40:00.560 --> 40:01.640]  Okay, well, all right.
[40:02.260 --> 40:02.620]  Well...
[40:04.220 --> 40:05.520]  Okay, you got it.
[40:05.620 --> 40:06.020]  Yeah.
[40:06.540 --> 40:06.780]  Okay.
[40:07.240 --> 40:08.440]  So what are these, then?
[40:08.700 --> 40:09.680]  Those are the...
[40:09.680 --> 40:10.680]  These are former Ian's?
[40:10.780 --> 40:11.560]  Former Ian's, yeah.
[40:11.680 --> 40:11.840]  Huh.
[40:12.280 --> 40:13.300]  A little hard to see, but...
[40:13.300 --> 40:13.480]  For the tests.
[40:14.800 --> 40:16.140]  Probably a little easier to see this way.
[40:16.980 --> 40:17.340]  Ian's.
[40:18.840 --> 40:20.080]  Okay, is that right?
[40:20.740 --> 40:21.680]  Those are nice Ian's.
[40:22.020 --> 40:22.340]  Stick.
[40:22.820 --> 40:23.640]  Goddammit, it moved.
[40:24.700 --> 40:26.440]  It's really fucking hard to do upside down.
[40:26.560 --> 40:26.760]  Okay.
[40:27.600 --> 40:28.400]  Nick, look at the shirt.
[40:30.360 --> 40:31.160]  Three, three...
[40:31.160 --> 40:31.620]  Oh, what?
[40:31.620 --> 40:34.000]  Oh, don't tell anyone, though.
[40:34.300 --> 40:34.540]  Okay.
[40:37.560 --> 40:38.940]  I wanted Nick to look at the shirt.
[40:39.820 --> 40:40.960]  Okay, so this is it, right?
[40:40.980 --> 40:41.780]  Then we stamp it down.
[40:41.860 --> 40:42.780]  Okay, nice and easy.
[40:45.000 --> 40:45.800]  That's awesome.
[40:46.060 --> 40:46.880]  So what's...
[40:46.880 --> 40:48.100]  Why are we doing this?
[40:49.900 --> 40:52.580]  So, a while back, when I did the...
[40:52.580 --> 40:53.640]  When we did the wrist pockets.
[40:53.740 --> 40:53.920]  Yeah.
[40:54.240 --> 40:58.140]  I made 50 of these, or some special ones.
[40:59.640 --> 41:01.820]  And that I included as giveaways.
[41:02.020 --> 41:05.700]  I thought it would be fun at RTX to make 100 of these.
[41:06.280 --> 41:06.300]  Wow!
[41:06.480 --> 41:07.540]  Well, I'm not going to make them at RTX.
[41:07.660 --> 41:08.320]  I'm going to make them at home.
[41:08.520 --> 41:10.160]  But make 100 of these.
[41:10.260 --> 41:14.880]  And then I was going to put 50, just randomly inserted in some fuckface merch from the store.
[41:14.940 --> 41:15.480]  Oh, cool.
[41:15.620 --> 41:16.600]  Just slide it in the bag.
[41:16.820 --> 41:19.520]  So if you get one, you get a chance at getting one.
[41:19.880 --> 41:21.900]  And then I was going to carry 50 around with me.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.400]  So if anybody asks me about fuckface or whatever, I can be like, here, have a...
[41:24.400 --> 41:25.100]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[41:25.160 --> 41:26.620]  Those would be gone in the first hour of the first day.
[41:26.720 --> 41:26.900]  Yeah.
[41:26.960 --> 41:27.560]  That's pretty exciting.
[41:27.560 --> 41:29.740]  I'm going to make 100 and then give them away.
[41:30.040 --> 41:32.520]  You might want to consider making more if you're going to just carry them around and hand them out.
[41:32.580 --> 41:34.200]  Well, as you've seen, it's a whole process.
[41:37.100 --> 41:38.480]  This is really cool.
[41:38.960 --> 41:43.720]  This show is innovative in a way that you would never expect.
[41:44.440 --> 41:45.580]  Yeah, no, I agree.
[41:45.760 --> 41:46.300]  I totally agree.
[41:46.560 --> 41:48.120]  You know why we did it?
[41:48.680 --> 41:51.980]  It's because I kept looking at cards that are numbered and going like, I could do that, right?
[41:52.140 --> 41:52.240]  Yeah.
[41:52.320 --> 41:53.060]  I could figure that out.
[41:53.160 --> 41:53.600]  And so we did.
[41:53.720 --> 41:55.420]  So now there's an Ian and all over a Tim Conway.
[41:55.600 --> 41:56.920]  Yeah, so now there's a Tim Conway Ian.
[41:56.920 --> 41:57.720]  That's very cool.
[41:58.200 --> 41:58.860]  It looks great.
[41:58.980 --> 42:00.180]  Yeah, it's really good.
[42:00.200 --> 42:00.520]  Yeah.
[42:01.320 --> 42:02.740]  And yeah, so there you go.
[42:02.920 --> 42:04.760]  What an insane thing that we have.
[42:04.820 --> 42:06.660]  Hit me up at RTX if you see me and ask me for one.
[42:06.840 --> 42:08.960]  And I'm sure I'm going to get sick of that real fucking fast.
[42:08.980 --> 42:11.180]  Yeah, you really did yourself in on that one.
[42:11.820 --> 42:13.380]  Here's a little bit of homework for myself.
[42:13.600 --> 42:14.540]  Well, here's what I'll do.
[42:14.660 --> 42:15.460]  So I bought this.
[42:15.700 --> 42:18.080]  I got this box of 89 FLIR update.
[42:18.220 --> 42:18.380]  Yeah.
[42:18.460 --> 42:20.540]  And so I thought it had Billy Ripken's in it, but it doesn't.
[42:20.720 --> 42:23.880]  So it's numbered one to 132.
[42:24.360 --> 42:25.240]  I'll just do them all.
[42:25.620 --> 42:26.260]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[42:26.260 --> 42:27.640]  So then they'll be sequentially numbered.
[42:27.900 --> 42:29.220]  And then you have the whole set.
[42:29.800 --> 42:30.520]  That's very cool.
[42:30.780 --> 42:31.340]  So that'll be fun.
[42:31.420 --> 42:31.920]  I like that.
[42:32.140 --> 42:32.520]  Yeah, thanks.
[42:32.660 --> 42:33.340]  That's a good idea.
[42:33.680 --> 42:34.700]  So there was that.
[42:35.620 --> 42:36.560]  RTX is going to be fun.
[42:36.820 --> 42:37.380]  You know what we should do?
[42:37.500 --> 42:37.880]  Yeah, what's that?
[42:37.920 --> 42:40.600]  Let's open up some old...
[42:40.600 --> 42:41.300]  I found this box.
[42:41.360 --> 42:42.760]  I was cleaning out all the fuckface stuff.
[42:42.880 --> 42:43.200]  Oh, cool.
[42:43.260 --> 42:46.640]  And I forgot I bought a bunch of zimmable baseball caps.
[42:46.640 --> 42:46.980]  That's awesome.
[42:47.020 --> 42:47.760]  How many go in the pack sack?
[42:48.800 --> 42:48.940]  One.
[42:49.340 --> 42:49.660]  Fantastic.
[42:50.900 --> 42:54.900]  Okay, let's open up two packs of 1990 tops.
[42:54.900 --> 42:55.960]  1990 tops.
[42:56.100 --> 42:58.760]  Obviously, we're looking for Don Zimmer to a lesser extent.
[42:58.960 --> 43:03.080]  Probably Ken Griffey Jr. is not in there.
[43:04.140 --> 43:05.020]  Don Mattingly.
[43:05.100 --> 43:05.580]  Wade Boggs.
[43:06.100 --> 43:06.600]  Roger Clemens.
[43:06.840 --> 43:07.240]  I guess.
[43:08.060 --> 43:08.900]  Martin McGuire.
[43:09.080 --> 43:10.740]  I mean, Clemens had been in the league for what?
[43:11.460 --> 43:12.380]  Five years?
[43:12.960 --> 43:15.240]  Cal Ripken and Nolan Ryan.
[43:15.340 --> 43:15.660]  They're perennial.
[43:16.700 --> 43:17.820]  Dan Bilzerian.
[43:17.920 --> 43:18.140]  Cool.
[43:18.760 --> 43:19.880]  Bernie Williams.
[43:20.880 --> 43:22.140]  Brett Bilevin.
[43:22.700 --> 43:23.400]  Kurt Wilkerson.
[43:23.400 --> 43:24.880]  It doesn't matter.
[43:25.180 --> 43:26.580]  It doesn't matter.
[43:26.700 --> 43:26.940]  Keep going.
[43:27.140 --> 43:27.900]  Bob Welch.
[43:28.400 --> 43:31.740]  Ooh, A. Bartlett Giamatti.
[43:32.140 --> 43:33.380]  Hang on.
[43:33.580 --> 43:35.260]  This looks like a card from now.
[43:35.720 --> 43:39.200]  That looks like a photo in 2022 of just a man.
[43:39.560 --> 43:39.600]  Yeah.
[43:39.840 --> 43:40.160]  What is?
[43:40.260 --> 43:40.880]  Who is that?
[43:41.220 --> 43:44.000]  He was the president of...
[43:44.000 --> 43:45.380]  He was the commissioner of Major League Baseball.
[43:45.980 --> 43:46.500]  Oh.
[43:46.640 --> 43:49.320]  From 489 to 989.
[43:50.560 --> 43:51.820]  Oh, then he died.
[43:52.300 --> 43:55.500]  He was only commissioner for fucking five months, then he died.
[43:55.600 --> 43:56.200]  That sucks.
[43:56.340 --> 43:57.360]  Got a nice card, though.
[43:57.460 --> 43:58.620]  Joel Skinner.
[43:58.960 --> 43:59.880]  Jesus Christ.
[44:00.000 --> 44:00.680]  John Farrell.
[44:00.780 --> 44:02.400]  I worked with at the call center.
[44:02.640 --> 44:03.060]  What?
[44:03.080 --> 44:03.540]  Different guy.
[44:03.760 --> 44:04.180]  Same name.
[44:04.580 --> 44:05.340]  Lenny Dykstra.
[44:05.620 --> 44:05.980]  Nails.
[44:06.160 --> 44:06.500]  Hey, all right.
[44:06.500 --> 44:07.080]  There's nails.
[44:07.220 --> 44:08.440]  Yeah, this is...
[44:08.440 --> 44:09.480]  You're not gonna keep that one?
[44:09.780 --> 44:10.220]  Yeah.
[44:10.280 --> 44:10.560]  Yeah.
[44:10.860 --> 44:12.000]  You gotta keep nails.
[44:12.420 --> 44:13.980]  If you don't know anything about Lenny Dykstra...
[44:15.160 --> 44:18.160]  There's a Google rabbit hole you can go down for a long time.
[44:18.520 --> 44:19.400]  Holy shit.
[44:19.720 --> 44:20.520]  Legit maniac.
[44:21.180 --> 44:21.620]  Maniac.
[44:21.620 --> 44:23.020]  Probably in jail right now, I would imagine.
[44:23.060 --> 44:23.600]  Oh, do you remember...
[44:23.600 --> 44:24.700]  Or living in somebody's mansion.
[44:24.760 --> 44:28.240]  When he was talking about, like, I've been arrested in, like, six months.
[44:28.240 --> 44:29.480]  And it's like, great.
[44:31.540 --> 44:32.960]  Just, oh, monster.
[44:33.140 --> 44:33.640]  J-PAL.
[44:33.720 --> 44:34.100]  All right.
[44:35.740 --> 44:36.460]  Craig McMurtry.
[44:37.500 --> 44:38.220]  Todd Benzinger.
[44:38.460 --> 44:38.620]  What's up?
[44:39.200 --> 44:40.880]  Wait, wait, can we go back to...
[44:40.880 --> 44:41.520]  Is he wearing glasses?
[44:41.940 --> 44:42.340]  Yeah, dude.
[44:42.480 --> 44:43.420]  Is he a substitute teacher?
[44:44.320 --> 44:45.520]  You gotta see where the ball...
[44:47.440 --> 44:49.400]  Imagine if there was a player that just...
[44:49.400 --> 44:50.920]  Yeah, a player that dressed like that now.
[44:51.060 --> 44:51.520]  That'd suck.
[44:52.500 --> 44:53.580]  Todd Benzinger.
[44:54.680 --> 44:55.760]  Spike Jones.
[44:57.500 --> 44:58.340]  Tony Pena.
[44:59.480 --> 45:00.380]  Rick Rudin.
[45:00.940 --> 45:01.760]  Love this producing.
[45:02.500 --> 45:03.580]  Jay Howell.
[45:05.060 --> 45:06.240]  So nothing good.
[45:06.320 --> 45:06.620]  No.
[45:06.980 --> 45:07.180]  Cool.
[45:07.320 --> 45:07.980]  Maybe this pack, though.
[45:08.100 --> 45:08.240]  All right.
[45:08.260 --> 45:09.340]  They're in remarkably good shape.
[45:09.440 --> 45:09.800]  They are.
[45:10.080 --> 45:12.200]  They're not really sealed very well, but...
[45:12.200 --> 45:12.640]  There's gum.
[45:12.800 --> 45:13.360]  Anyone want gum?
[45:13.700 --> 45:15.080]  The 90s was a safer time.
[45:17.520 --> 45:18.600]  Kurt Schilling.
[45:19.920 --> 45:20.460]  Wow.
[45:20.820 --> 45:21.040]  Yeah.
[45:22.380 --> 45:24.420]  I don't remember him as an Oriole.
[45:24.460 --> 45:24.940]  I don't either.
[45:25.100 --> 45:26.860]  I saw him in a commercial recently, I think.
[45:27.480 --> 45:28.180]  Lima Zilli.
[45:28.400 --> 45:29.220]  Was it for MyPillow?
[45:32.560 --> 45:33.820]  He did go that way, didn't he?
[45:34.540 --> 45:35.640]  I forgot about that.
[45:35.700 --> 45:36.920]  I was just wondering where you saw him in a commercial.
[45:38.640 --> 45:39.360]  Jose Guzman.
[45:40.940 --> 45:41.660]  Nick Laieva.
[45:42.480 --> 45:43.200]  Randy Velarde.
[45:44.040 --> 45:44.700]  Otis Nixon.
[45:44.800 --> 45:45.440]  I always liked Otis Nixon.
[45:45.640 --> 45:45.820]  Mm-hmm.
[45:46.460 --> 45:46.820]  Oh, Rick Gedman.
[45:46.820 --> 45:48.140]  Love those Expos jerseys, too.
[45:48.320 --> 45:49.460]  Expos jerseys were so nice.
[45:49.740 --> 45:50.440]  Tom Glavin.
[45:51.200 --> 45:52.080]  Ken Caminiti.
[45:52.500 --> 45:53.980]  Hey, Ken got me on the Expos.
[45:54.760 --> 45:55.600]  Fucking mullet.
[45:55.720 --> 45:56.020]  Yep.
[45:56.020 --> 45:56.460]  Saving that.
[45:56.540 --> 45:56.780]  Beautiful.
[45:57.300 --> 45:58.080]  Ooh, Bobby Bonilla.
[45:59.280 --> 46:00.980]  Aren't the Mets still paying him?
[46:01.880 --> 46:02.800]  Oh, that's him, huh?
[46:02.980 --> 46:03.140]  Yeah.
[46:03.280 --> 46:04.780]  Yeah, he gets paid like once a year.
[46:05.180 --> 46:06.360]  Like, it's Bobby Bonilla Day.
[46:06.500 --> 46:06.740]  Yeah.
[46:06.920 --> 46:08.060]  When is Bobby Bonilla Day?
[46:08.060 --> 46:09.840]  It's for like 25 years or something.
[46:09.900 --> 46:09.960]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:09.960 --> 46:12.480]  He's been retired, fuck, probably since like 96.
[46:12.720 --> 46:12.920]  Yep.
[46:14.060 --> 46:14.880]  Terry Kennedy.
[46:15.660 --> 46:16.720]  Randy St. Clair.
[46:17.500 --> 46:18.380]  Roger Craig.
[46:18.460 --> 46:19.000]  There's a manager card.
[46:21.000 --> 46:21.960]  Bob Darnier.
[46:22.760 --> 46:24.180]  And Harold Reynolds.
[46:24.380 --> 46:24.920]  Back on the fucking...
[46:25.720 --> 46:26.200]  July.
[46:26.360 --> 46:27.700]  We're coming up on Bobby Bonilla Day.
[46:27.840 --> 46:29.940]  July 1st is Bobby Bonilla Day.
[46:30.660 --> 46:37.080]  The Mets still owe the former All-Star $1.19 million a year until he's 72.
[46:38.420 --> 46:39.340]  Imagine, get it?
[46:39.360 --> 46:42.980]  You don't have to do shit and you just got a million dollars coming your way.
[46:43.440 --> 46:44.200]  That's awesome.
[46:44.520 --> 46:44.960]  Isn't that cool?
[46:45.420 --> 46:46.320]  I want to be Bobby Bonilla.
[46:47.040 --> 46:47.520]  Damn.
[46:48.140 --> 46:49.220]  Bobby Bonilla Day rules.
[46:50.060 --> 46:50.820]  Oh, you know what?
[46:50.880 --> 46:52.740]  I have a little special present for you, Eric.
[46:52.960 --> 46:54.300]  A special present for me?
[46:54.500 --> 46:55.260]  Not a present, but a surprise.
[46:55.360 --> 46:56.240]  A fun thing for us to open.
[46:56.400 --> 46:56.660]  Okay.
[46:57.460 --> 46:59.060]  I know I always hit you with the wrestling.
[46:59.220 --> 46:59.400]  Yeah.
[46:59.680 --> 47:02.900]  But I also have for you a little Umbrella Academy.
[47:03.240 --> 47:03.600]  No!
[47:04.060 --> 47:05.180]  Yeah, we still have some.
[47:06.060 --> 47:08.700]  I don't know how much you missed it, but we're talking about it.
[47:09.620 --> 47:11.880]  I thought the Bollywood card...
[47:11.880 --> 47:12.980]  There's so many packs left.
[47:13.200 --> 47:13.740]  So many.
[47:13.840 --> 47:14.560]  I'll put one in the pack sack.
[47:15.100 --> 47:15.460]  Why?
[47:17.120 --> 47:18.080]  You said I got it.
[47:18.080 --> 47:19.740]  I hate these cards.
[47:20.760 --> 47:23.840]  These are the bane of doing this show.
[47:23.920 --> 47:26.140]  Rebecca always begs me to open these.
[47:26.400 --> 47:29.520]  So I decided today we're gonna make her and you happy.
[47:29.560 --> 47:32.080]  We're gonna see the same ones we've already seen.
[47:32.240 --> 47:34.800]  We can only hope.
[47:35.280 --> 47:36.080]  For what?
[47:37.120 --> 47:38.800]  For Run, boy, Run.
[47:38.900 --> 47:39.620]  We've seen that one?
[47:39.920 --> 47:40.360]  Yeah, we have.
[47:40.480 --> 47:40.660]  Yep.
[47:41.180 --> 47:41.560]  Is that right?
[47:41.600 --> 47:41.740]  Yeah.
[47:43.240 --> 47:44.120]  How about...
[47:44.120 --> 47:46.020]  Oh, yeah, we definitely saw Man on the Moon before.
[47:46.460 --> 47:47.160]  Oh, shit.
[47:47.160 --> 47:50.820]  But have we seen an on-card auto of Justin Nim?
[47:51.120 --> 47:51.320]  Min?
[47:51.580 --> 47:52.020]  Justin Min?
[47:52.380 --> 47:53.180]  It's upside down.
[47:53.760 --> 47:54.980]  It's Nim upside down.
[47:55.940 --> 47:57.060]  That's fucking cool.
[47:57.860 --> 47:58.420]  Is it?
[47:58.620 --> 47:59.520]  Yeah, he's been hard right.
[47:59.600 --> 48:00.760]  It's one of the main characters.
[48:01.520 --> 48:02.640]  Oh, Man on the Moon.
[48:03.000 --> 48:03.620]  We say that a lot.
[48:04.880 --> 48:06.300]  And the day that was...
[48:06.300 --> 48:08.420]  Dude, I need to sleeve that auto pretty soon.
[48:08.500 --> 48:09.320]  That's fucking cool.
[48:09.520 --> 48:11.420]  Yeah, it's gonna be worth a dollar pretty soon, man.
[48:11.500 --> 48:12.080]  It's gonna be nuts.
[48:14.240 --> 48:15.640]  You know, new season coming out soon.
[48:16.060 --> 48:17.000]  Are you serious?
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.200]  You're doing more?
[48:18.420 --> 48:18.560]  Yeah.
[48:18.620 --> 48:19.080]  Oh, hell yeah.
[48:19.260 --> 48:19.680]  Oh, man.
[48:20.600 --> 48:21.040]  All right.
[48:22.380 --> 48:22.920]  Oh, no.
[48:25.240 --> 48:26.040]  Open, fucker.
[48:29.200 --> 48:31.640]  We only see each other at weddings and funerals.
[48:32.460 --> 48:33.860]  The day that wasn't.
[48:34.720 --> 48:36.360]  Also, the day that wasn't.
[48:36.440 --> 48:37.460]  These cards suck.
[48:37.620 --> 48:39.080]  Ooh, the day that was.
[48:43.020 --> 48:44.820]  And extra ordinary.
[48:45.460 --> 48:46.580]  These cards are...
[48:46.580 --> 48:47.420]  Are we done with these yet?
[48:47.700 --> 48:48.180]  Extremely ordinary.
[48:48.500 --> 48:50.340]  I put it away already, so you don't have to look at it again for a while.
[48:50.440 --> 48:50.860]  Thank God.
[48:52.360 --> 48:53.380]  What do you want to tuck into?
[48:53.860 --> 48:54.840]  Should we fuck with some football?
[48:54.980 --> 48:55.520]  Let's do it.
[48:58.400 --> 48:59.260]  Who's your football team?
[49:00.240 --> 49:00.980]  I don't really have one.
[49:01.080 --> 49:01.720]  Yeah, me neither.
[49:02.820 --> 49:06.920]  I mean, I had Alabama for college, but when I was a kid, the closest thing was the Saints.
[49:06.980 --> 49:08.820]  And the Saints were dog shit my entire childhood.
[49:09.000 --> 49:09.120]  Yeah.
[49:09.360 --> 49:11.180]  Not fun to root for at all in any way.
[49:11.580 --> 49:14.580]  So, Teddy Bridgewater, Ryan Tannehill.
[49:14.580 --> 49:15.540]  You don't have the...
[49:16.740 --> 49:17.240]  The who?
[49:18.660 --> 49:19.180]  The Rams?
[49:19.560 --> 49:22.740]  No. I guess that's probably the closest team that I would root for.
[49:22.820 --> 49:23.340]  Phillip Lindsey.
[49:23.920 --> 49:26.100]  Just so they can stick it to the Chargers every year. That's fine.
[49:26.180 --> 49:27.080]  Tom Taylor. Oh, yeah.
[49:28.180 --> 49:30.900]  No, I don't think I ever will until they move back.
[49:31.120 --> 49:31.620]  Derrick Carr.
[49:32.500 --> 49:37.680]  I felt like he used to play for the Houston in the early 2000s.
[49:37.760 --> 49:38.660]  But I guess that was Drew Carr.
[49:39.180 --> 49:39.740]  That was David.
[49:39.920 --> 49:41.120]  Yeah, it's his brother, isn't it?
[49:41.280 --> 49:41.720]  Is it his brother?
[49:41.860 --> 49:42.000]  Yeah.
[49:42.180 --> 49:43.520]  Oh, there you go.
[49:43.520 --> 49:45.180]  That's why this feels like the same dude.
[49:46.420 --> 49:47.120]  Cam Newton.
[49:47.500 --> 49:48.140]  Is he still around?
[49:49.100 --> 49:49.500]  Yes.
[49:49.940 --> 49:51.400]  He's got to be a backup to a backup somewhere.
[49:51.560 --> 49:52.500]  Making a paycheck.
[49:52.740 --> 49:53.740]  CeeDee Lamb.
[49:53.920 --> 49:54.180]  Oh.
[49:55.760 --> 49:56.560]  DeAndre Swift.
[49:59.600 --> 50:00.400]  Alvin Kamara.
[50:02.400 --> 50:03.860]  DeAndre Swift again, that's parallel.
[50:04.060 --> 50:05.360]  You don't have to read them upside down.
[50:05.680 --> 50:07.020]  Like, you can read them right side up.
[50:07.040 --> 50:08.580]  You can just turn the whole...
[50:08.580 --> 50:09.540]  Oh, yeah, I could do that, huh?
[50:10.740 --> 50:12.440]  Like, Ramondre Stevenson rookie.
[50:12.920 --> 50:14.540]  See how it's easier this way?
[50:14.540 --> 50:15.720]  Nick Chubb.
[50:16.640 --> 50:18.220]  I gotta do a complicated flip.
[50:18.680 --> 50:19.340]  Kellen Mond.
[50:19.540 --> 50:20.360]  You're doing great with it, though.
[50:20.640 --> 50:22.400]  Ooh, Asante Samuel Jr.
[50:24.380 --> 50:25.220]  He's wearing a hat.
[50:25.520 --> 50:26.000]  That's fun.
[50:26.140 --> 50:26.860]  Ramondre Stevenson.
[50:28.240 --> 50:28.880]  Ernest Jones.
[50:28.940 --> 50:29.500]  He's wearing a hat.
[50:29.560 --> 50:30.260]  I didn't even see his hat.
[50:31.440 --> 50:32.900]  It just, from over here, looks like he's wearing a hat.
[50:33.420 --> 50:34.100]  He is wearing a hat.
[50:34.260 --> 50:35.380]  It's like a little beret or something.
[50:35.940 --> 50:36.300]  I don't know.
[50:36.440 --> 50:36.820]  It's cute.
[50:36.880 --> 50:37.600]  He's doing a football beret?
[50:37.680 --> 50:38.480]  Yeah, a little football beret.
[50:39.100 --> 50:39.740]  Tyson Campbell.
[50:40.280 --> 50:42.100]  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[50:42.240 --> 50:42.420]  Awesome.
[50:42.660 --> 50:43.760]  See, it's hard because of the flip.
[50:43.760 --> 50:44.560]  Jalen Waddle.
[50:44.740 --> 50:45.440]  Alabama rookie.
[50:45.680 --> 50:46.340]  Oh, nice.
[50:46.500 --> 50:47.160]  Yeah, there we go.
[50:47.640 --> 50:49.320]  And then Quincy Roche.
[50:53.160 --> 50:55.840]  Not very exciting to do football cards when it's not football season, huh?
[50:56.200 --> 50:58.300]  Yeah, it's not exciting at all.
[50:59.820 --> 51:00.920]  All right, we'll put those.
[51:02.540 --> 51:05.020]  And we could now...
[51:05.620 --> 51:06.980]  We have more mail.
[51:07.280 --> 51:08.740]  We have packs of stuff.
[51:08.740 --> 51:09.320]  Let's do more mail.
[51:09.460 --> 51:11.900]  You have to open it with this and you have to be careful to not show an address.
[51:12.260 --> 51:12.780]  There you go, see?
[51:12.780 --> 51:14.000]  See how you're doing?
[51:14.000 --> 51:14.400]  You're doing great.
[51:14.880 --> 51:16.060]  Okay, all right, all right, okay.
[51:16.280 --> 51:17.000]  Jesus Christ.
[51:17.920 --> 51:18.860]  There will be blood.
[51:19.200 --> 51:20.040]  Oh, awesome.
[51:20.600 --> 51:23.520]  And now we just have to let it soak a little bit and then I think we got this.
[51:24.920 --> 51:25.780]  Oh, this is exciting.
[51:26.420 --> 51:26.900]  Has it?
[51:26.980 --> 51:27.340]  Okay, cool.
[51:28.440 --> 51:29.600]  Oh, this is way more.
[51:29.800 --> 51:30.480]  It's soaked in.
[51:30.560 --> 51:31.160]  Good job.
[51:31.980 --> 51:32.260]  See?
[51:34.280 --> 51:35.000]  What are you looking at?
[51:35.400 --> 51:35.880]  Something cool?
[51:35.880 --> 51:37.060]  I'm sure it's not going to bite me.
[51:39.020 --> 51:40.600]  Okay, let's see what we got here.
[51:41.580 --> 51:42.360]  This is from...
[51:44.000 --> 51:45.280]  Well, I can't really see the name anymore.
[51:46.900 --> 51:48.220]  I want to say it's Liz.
[51:51.400 --> 51:52.140]  That'll be a note.
[51:53.200 --> 51:54.480]  You just tore it apart.
[51:54.760 --> 51:56.300]  Who the fuck sent this?
[52:02.000 --> 52:02.360]  Liv.
[52:03.600 --> 52:06.320]  Liv said, Dear Geoff, Gavin, Andrew, Eric, and Nick.
[52:06.560 --> 52:07.920]  I recently stumbled...
[52:07.920 --> 52:10.460]  By the way, if you ever send us something and you don't want us to read the letter out loud,
[52:10.600 --> 52:14.300]  the first sentence should be, Hey guys, don't read this out loud.
[52:14.340 --> 52:17.800]  Before it says, Dear whoever, at the top say, Don't read this out loud.
[52:18.080 --> 52:20.160]  I recently stumbled upon this and thought you should have it.
[52:20.260 --> 52:24.760]  I love listening to FACE every week and just wanted to...
[52:24.760 --> 52:25.420]  That was a good one.
[52:25.540 --> 52:26.280]  That was... yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:26.300 --> 52:28.700]  Thank you all for bringing a bit of laughter into my life.
[52:29.000 --> 52:29.860]  Well, you're welcome.
[52:30.200 --> 52:31.300]  Thank you for the nice note.
[52:34.680 --> 52:35.480]  Got rid of that.
[52:36.460 --> 52:38.800]  PS also made some ugly little bracelets for you.
[52:38.900 --> 52:39.600]  I think they're not ugly.
[52:39.600 --> 52:41.060]  The beads change color in sunlight.
[52:41.240 --> 52:41.660]  No shit.
[52:41.800 --> 52:42.200]  Oh, cool.
[52:42.360 --> 52:42.700]  That's cool.
[52:42.980 --> 52:44.740]  Oh, red and pink is Eric, obviously.
[52:45.580 --> 52:46.120]  Orange is Andrew.
[52:46.920 --> 52:47.980]  Yellow is Geoff.
[52:49.180 --> 52:49.760]  Yellow is Geoff.
[52:49.840 --> 52:50.900]  Yellow should be Andrew, right?
[52:50.920 --> 52:51.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:51.660 --> 52:52.480]  Because it's like you're an obsession.
[52:52.500 --> 52:53.400]  Yeah, he's like a piss boy.
[52:53.400 --> 52:54.040]  He's like a piss boy.
[52:54.100 --> 52:54.500]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:55.220 --> 52:56.020]  But I'll take yellow.
[52:56.240 --> 52:57.100]  I like... I like bananas.
[52:57.320 --> 52:57.720]  There you go.
[52:57.980 --> 52:58.580]  I like bananas a lot.
[52:58.700 --> 52:59.960]  I threw away three bananas today.
[53:00.120 --> 53:00.470]  Green is...
[53:01.660 --> 53:02.740]  Green is super fan, Jack.
[53:02.760 --> 53:03.700]  You could have made a banana bread out of that.
[53:03.920 --> 53:05.880]  Blue is Gavin and purple is Nick.
[53:06.260 --> 53:07.240]  You don't have to wear them.
[53:08.540 --> 53:09.360]  I'm just going to wear them.
[53:10.460 --> 53:11.720]  Don't tell us not to wear them.
[53:12.580 --> 53:13.920]  Let's see what this is.
[53:14.280 --> 53:15.660]  Ooh, an authentic memories.
[53:16.120 --> 53:16.780]  Oh, okay, cool.
[53:18.840 --> 53:19.480]  What is it?
[53:19.660 --> 53:20.460]  Now I know what it is.
[53:20.800 --> 53:22.120]  What is it?
[53:22.340 --> 53:22.480]  Liv Sinas.
[53:22.600 --> 53:23.240]  Liv Sinas.
[53:23.240 --> 53:24.200]  I'm not even gonna take it out of the bag.
[53:24.400 --> 53:24.600]  Oh.
[53:24.820 --> 53:28.740]  Liv Sinas, an officially autographed Don Zimmer baseball.
[53:28.860 --> 53:29.980]  No way!
[53:30.580 --> 53:30.860]  Yeah.
[53:31.360 --> 53:32.720]  Oh, that's awesome!
[53:33.220 --> 53:34.740]  Look, authentic memories right here.
[53:34.920 --> 53:37.080]  Don Zimmer signed an official American League baseball.
[53:38.680 --> 53:39.720]  No way!
[53:40.320 --> 53:41.620]  Dude, are you serious?
[53:43.080 --> 53:45.000]  Oh, that's so cool!
[53:45.700 --> 53:48.940]  That baseball was in his pudgy little hands.
[53:49.380 --> 53:50.140]  Hold it up.
[53:53.180 --> 53:54.180]  Our hero.
[53:54.560 --> 53:55.080]  Wow!
[53:56.180 --> 53:57.320]  Hang on, there we go.
[53:58.500 --> 53:59.940]  Put it right up next to your face.
[54:00.740 --> 54:01.840]  Oh, that's a good one.
[54:02.760 --> 54:04.560]  Oh, we got some good content, baby.
[54:04.900 --> 54:07.100]  That's really a Don Zimmer signed baseball.
[54:07.100 --> 54:07.940]  It's official.
[54:08.480 --> 54:08.840]  Wow!
[54:09.100 --> 54:09.660]  I love it.
[54:10.840 --> 54:11.560]  Holy shit!
[54:11.680 --> 54:12.280]  That's my favorite thing.
[54:12.640 --> 54:13.520]  Uh, sorry, Millie.
[54:15.980 --> 54:17.160]  Dude, that is amazing.
[54:18.260 --> 54:19.720]  Oh my god, thank you, Liv.
[54:23.780 --> 54:25.080]  I'm... I'm floored.
[54:25.260 --> 54:27.020]  I'm floored by this.
[54:27.500 --> 54:29.500]  That's a... we... that's crazy!
[54:29.640 --> 54:31.080]  We have to take this outside to see what color they are.
[54:31.080 --> 54:31.940]  Oh yeah, that's... oh no!
[54:31.940 --> 54:33.580]  We'll put your bracelets on when we go outside,
[54:33.660 --> 54:34.760]  because they're all the same color right now,
[54:34.800 --> 54:35.780]  because they changed color outside.
[54:37.100 --> 54:38.000]  We'll do it in a little bit.
[54:38.100 --> 54:38.740]  Thank you, Liv.
[54:39.020 --> 54:39.840]  Oh my god.
[54:40.060 --> 54:41.560]  I'm... I'm... I can't believe that.
[54:41.700 --> 54:42.000]  Blown away.
[54:43.780 --> 54:44.630]  Just blown away.
[54:45.640 --> 54:47.240]  The kindness and the generosity.
[54:47.580 --> 54:49.180]  We have a Don Zimmer baseball?
[54:49.420 --> 54:51.540]  Dude, we are officially in the Zim Zone.
[54:51.660 --> 54:52.840]  We got double Zim today.
[54:54.400 --> 54:56.400]  And you can tell it's the same signature.
[54:58.380 --> 54:59.000]  Like, look at that.
[54:59.280 --> 55:00.480]  You probably can't see.
[55:01.140 --> 55:01.540]  Oh, wait!
[55:01.940 --> 55:02.420]  Getting there.
[55:03.300 --> 55:03.960]  There you go.
[55:04.720 --> 55:05.140]  Clearly.
[55:05.140 --> 55:07.000]  Look at his little face.
[55:07.240 --> 55:07.540]  Clearly.
[55:21.420 --> 55:24.620]  That's Don Zimmer coming to you to give you a kiss.
[55:26.040 --> 55:27.540]  Pucker up, buttercup.
[55:28.480 --> 55:30.180]  Welcome to the Zim Zone.
[55:31.400 --> 55:32.460]  Oh my god, that's...
[55:32.460 --> 55:32.760]  Wow!
[55:32.800 --> 55:33.260]  That's amazing.
[55:33.360 --> 55:34.240]  Two Zimmers today.
[55:34.640 --> 55:35.020]  That's...
[55:35.020 --> 55:36.120]  We got the Padre Zim and...
[55:36.120 --> 55:36.340]  Wow!
[55:36.680 --> 55:37.760]  What a phenomenal day.
[55:37.760 --> 55:38.920]  What a great day to be us.
[55:39.160 --> 55:39.460]  What?
[55:39.780 --> 55:42.100]  I'm so glad I'm not Gavin or Andrew or...
[55:42.100 --> 55:42.380]  Oh!
[55:43.360 --> 55:43.720]  Oh!
[55:47.080 --> 55:48.420]  Now I was thinking we could...
[55:49.060 --> 55:49.940]  Because I've been wanting to do this for a while.
[55:49.960 --> 55:52.360]  Because I still want to get the Hodor, Hodor card.
[55:52.460 --> 55:53.000]  Oh, that's right.
[55:53.220 --> 55:56.640]  Otto, let's open up some Game of Thrones that I bought.
[56:00.440 --> 56:01.520]  Is that the theme song?
[56:01.860 --> 56:02.620]  Yeah, you nailed it.
[56:03.320 --> 56:05.560]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[56:05.560 --> 56:08.400]  Somebody was trying to sing the Pirates of the Caribbean theme song the other day
[56:08.400 --> 56:10.920]  and that made me go like, oh, it's the same thing.
[56:11.260 --> 56:12.060]  We're gonna open...
[56:13.320 --> 56:14.960]  You save money if you just use the same song.
[56:18.620 --> 56:19.520]  We're gonna open this many.
[56:19.680 --> 56:20.400]  I put one in the pack sack.
[56:21.160 --> 56:22.180]  They're making a new show.
[56:22.660 --> 56:23.040]  Game of Thrones?
[56:23.380 --> 56:23.580]  Yeah.
[56:23.740 --> 56:26.060]  Weren't they making like a prequel with Arya
[56:26.060 --> 56:29.220]  and then now they're making like a Jon Snow sequel?
[56:29.220 --> 56:31.200]  Yeah, I heard they're doing a Jon Snow thing.
[56:31.200 --> 56:36.340]  Talk about a series that has just lost all steam.
[56:36.680 --> 56:38.640]  People have not revisited King of Thrones.
[56:39.920 --> 56:41.380]  King Tommen, everybody's favorite.
[56:41.460 --> 56:44.780]  Who the fuck? Who the fuck is that?
[56:45.020 --> 56:47.740]  King Tommen. Everybody loves King Tommen.
[56:49.580 --> 56:50.640]  There's a dragon.
[56:52.100 --> 56:53.380]  King Tommen.
[56:54.540 --> 56:57.860]  Do you remember Meera Reed?
[56:58.820 --> 56:59.960]  Was she the...
[57:02.180 --> 57:03.300]  Was she like...
[57:04.140 --> 57:05.880]  She's one of Bran's steadfast companions.
[57:06.180 --> 57:06.600]  Oh!
[57:07.540 --> 57:08.840]  Oh, Ser Brendan Tully.
[57:09.580 --> 57:09.860]  Oh!
[57:11.260 --> 57:12.840]  Oh, there's brother Lancel.
[57:13.880 --> 57:18.040]  This show, this fucking show, dude.
[57:18.300 --> 57:18.840]  Are these...
[57:18.840 --> 57:19.640]  Sansa Stark.
[57:19.800 --> 57:25.180]  If you bought these and they're like prank cards, I would have no...
[57:25.180 --> 57:27.220]  I would just assume like, man, you got me.
[57:27.220 --> 57:31.080]  Like, like they threw in like a Sansa to be like, see, it's real.
[57:31.440 --> 57:31.980]  Yeah, right.
[57:32.200 --> 57:38.100]  But like, you just shook like, like, what the fuck is this?
[57:38.260 --> 57:40.540]  We should make our own Game of Thrones cards.
[57:40.760 --> 57:41.420]  This is a good idea.
[57:41.680 --> 57:43.180]  Our own bootleg. Somebody write that down.
[57:43.420 --> 57:44.780]  This is insane looking.
[57:44.940 --> 57:46.940]  We're gonna make our own bootleg Game of Thrones cards.
[57:47.220 --> 57:48.940]  What season was the last season? Eight?
[57:49.480 --> 57:49.880]  Seven.
[57:50.140 --> 57:51.420]  From season... we're gonna do season 11.
[57:51.560 --> 57:53.020]  Oh, wow. Oh, that's cool.
[57:53.220 --> 57:54.560]  They have... there's like cards in it.
[57:55.700 --> 57:56.660]  Brother Rey.
[57:58.860 --> 58:00.020]  Is... wait, is that...
[58:00.660 --> 58:01.360]  Yeah, it's Wilson's face.
[58:01.380 --> 58:02.340]  Ian McShane or whatever?
[58:02.680 --> 58:04.060]  What? He was in that show?
[58:04.180 --> 58:04.900]  Yeah, big time.
[58:06.460 --> 58:09.040]  Everybody be aware of the winds of winter.
[58:09.480 --> 58:10.320]  They're, they're breezy.
[58:11.400 --> 58:11.880]  Chilly.
[58:12.580 --> 58:13.920]  There's Randall Tarly.
[58:17.080 --> 58:19.180]  Here is... oh, Oathbreaker.
[58:19.980 --> 58:21.900]  I guess it's just because it's Jamie Lannister.
[58:22.200 --> 58:22.720]  Oh, it's...
[58:22.720 --> 58:23.380]  I don't see the sword.
[58:23.380 --> 58:24.540]  Is there a sword in the shot?
[58:24.760 --> 58:26.120]  I don't see this sword.
[58:26.340 --> 58:27.520]  Oh, here's the Night King.
[58:29.800 --> 58:32.140]  The last two cards are from the show.
[58:32.320 --> 58:32.520]  Yes.
[58:32.600 --> 58:34.400]  The other ones, I'm not so sure.
[58:35.180 --> 58:36.360]  That one's from the show.
[58:36.680 --> 58:37.280]  Oh, here we go.
[58:37.400 --> 58:37.560]  Okay.
[58:37.840 --> 58:39.480]  Podrick Payne, remember him?
[58:40.040 --> 58:41.580]  Oh, he was the blacksmith kid.
[58:41.920 --> 58:43.340]  Daenerys Targaryen.
[58:43.500 --> 58:44.500]  He was the illegitimate kid.
[58:44.620 --> 58:45.060]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[58:47.640 --> 58:48.660]  Well, this is cool.
[58:48.800 --> 58:50.720]  Like a Game of Thrones...
[58:51.920 --> 58:52.720]  heart card.
[58:54.920 --> 58:56.320]  It's one eye.
[58:56.880 --> 58:58.140]  Is that Missandei?
[58:58.640 --> 58:58.960]  Yeah.
[58:59.260 --> 59:00.060]  Yeah, that must be it.
[59:01.860 --> 59:03.000]  Is it? Let's see.
[59:04.620 --> 59:08.500]  It just says, weak men will never rule Dorne again.
[59:09.000 --> 59:10.100]  But we're not men yet.
[59:10.360 --> 59:11.400]  Hmm, yeah.
[59:11.400 --> 59:13.880]  No, no, no, no, that's the three girls.
[59:14.400 --> 59:15.780]  That's the three girls.
[59:15.920 --> 59:16.640]  Everybody hated them.
[59:17.340 --> 59:18.700]  The Sandpipers or whatever?
[59:18.880 --> 59:19.900]  I don't fucking know.
[59:20.460 --> 59:21.020]  Sand Snakes.
[59:21.820 --> 59:22.860]  Sand Snakes.
[59:22.860 --> 59:23.980]  Grandmeister Pacel.
[59:24.140 --> 59:24.940]  Take a shower.
[59:26.000 --> 59:26.860]  Oh, here we go.
[59:27.620 --> 59:28.500]  No one.
[59:29.760 --> 59:30.640]  That's what it says.
[59:32.180 --> 59:32.880]  Oh no.
[59:35.780 --> 59:36.220]  Here's...
[59:37.100 --> 59:37.540]  That's...
[59:37.540 --> 59:39.560]  These cards can't be real.
[59:39.700 --> 59:40.760]  That's Lady Ginlock right there.
[59:41.120 --> 59:42.060]  Insane. Oh yeah, that's right.
[59:42.260 --> 59:42.400]  Yeah.
[59:43.740 --> 59:44.640]  Oh, here we go.
[59:44.740 --> 59:45.240]  Wander Franco.
[59:46.960 --> 59:48.120]  That's Walder Frey.
[59:48.780 --> 59:49.760]  What a piece of shit he was.
[59:50.020 --> 59:51.960]  There he is, shortstop for the race.
[59:51.960 --> 59:53.640]  Winter's windy again.
[59:55.100 --> 59:56.380]  Ooh, look at this.
[59:58.040 --> 59:58.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.620]  Dario Nahara, Sister Jorah Mormont.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.080]  Sharing a moment.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.680]  A more moment.
[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:07.940]  Oh, here's Balin Greyjoy.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.320]  Looking like he's in a prog rock band.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.040]  Hell yeah.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:12.120]  All right.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:13.900]  That's the guy who started Asia, right?
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:21.500]  Aye, aye, aye.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:27.920]  These might be my favorite cards we've ever opened because I genuinely don't know.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.040]  I don't, none of it.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.600]  Probably ran to the TV every week to watch.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.080]  I watched it until the guy got his hand cut off and then I went,
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.080]  I don't think I want to watch this anymore.
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.680]  And then watched some of it later and went, what the fuck?
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:40.700]  It's a baby.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:41.420]  Great.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:44.780]  Oh, here's Gregor Clegane.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.180]  Okay, so I know about this guy.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.080]  I know about that guy.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.560]  Uh-oh, broken man.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.620]  Uh-oh, hot dog.
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:54.780]  Jaquine Hagar.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.180]  He's the, uh, the Laura Morgales guy.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.340]  He's the face guy, right?
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:00:59.560]  Home.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.460]  That's what it says.
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.540]  That's where the dragon lives, next to that campfire.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:07.780]  Oh, he's a lizard.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.440]  He's keeping warm.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:08.740]  Yeah.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.420]  He's a, yeah.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.320]  Oh, uh, eat.
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:15.700]  You got it.
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:16.020]  Here it comes.
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:16.660]  What the fuck is this?
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:17.140]  No, you got it.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.920]  I, I just don't recognize the wig.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.120]  Izembarro.
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:21.700]  Oh, no.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.700]  Like, that's not real.
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:23.240]  That's a hat.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.820]  She's wearing a hat.
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:25.760]  Yeah, okay.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.400]  It's a hair hat, man.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:29.880]  Uh, hey, check it out.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.320]  Here's a fucking door.
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:32.500]  Why would you print the card?
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.600]  Why would you, you have all the, that's sad.
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:35.460]  I know, why would you?
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.400]  Tyrion Lannister.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:37.160]  I remember him.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:37.760]  Everybody loves him.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.020]  Yeah.
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:39.760]  Uh, young Eddard Stark.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:41.520]  Uh.
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:42.020]  Eddard?
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:42.620]  Eddard.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:43.900]  His name is Eddard?
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:44.980]  Eddard, yeah.
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.260]  Eddard?
[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.100]  That's why he fights.
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.140]  You gotta, listen, you name a kid Eddard, he's gonna have to learn how to fight.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.960]  Uh, and then everybody's favorite, Ramsay Bolton.
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.000]  He was a good guy.
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:55.880]  Everybody liked him.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.720]  He's the dog's guy, yeah?
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:57.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:57.600]  Yeah.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.600]  The flayed man.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:01:59.920]  Yeah.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:00.460]  Family.
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:01.160]  That was cool.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:01.800]  Yeah.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:02.780]  That part was cool.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.540]  Uh, okay.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:05.480]  Well, that was some of that.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.880]  Uh, what if we do a stamp?
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:09.420]  Let's try it.
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:10.360]  Let's see what happens.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.540]  Let me, let me get the Zim and the Coolio out of the way.
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:13.720]  All right, let's get the...
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.060]  We're gonna try this.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:18.100]  We're gonna see how it goes.
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:23.140]  Um, I think that in order for this to get the best shot...
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:25.460]  Hang on.
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:26.760]  We gotta figure this out.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.400]  Because I want this to look good on camera.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.840]  Um, so we might have to do a little bit of maneuvering.
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:32.660]  Brian, do you think that's all right?
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.460]  Or do you want us to do it up here?
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:34.780]  I'd do it on that.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:35.580]  Do it on this thing?
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:35.900]  Cool.
[01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:36.540]  Soft surface.
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:37.140]  There you go.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.340]  It's gonna be harder.
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:39.700]  That's good, just push hard.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:40.840]  You're strong, big strong boy.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:41.560]  Right?
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.140]  I am strong.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.000]  Yeah, I am strong.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.220]  All right, this looks good for right here.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.200]  You can see it's stamping down.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.420]  Look at that, that looks good.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.040]  All right, here we go.
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:51.480]  Here we go.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.980]  We are stamping down in the pad.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.740]  This is the Vancouver Child Kicker official stamp.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.140]  Press hard.
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:59.140]  You better press in that middle too.
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.240]  You better press, boy.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.080]  There you go.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:01.780]  There you go, see?
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.880]  Okay, wait, wait, how does it look?
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.480]  Like you gotta do it more.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:08.300]  It takes up to three hours.
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.800]  Well, no, you have to get more ink on this thing.
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.820]  I understand, but it doesn't fucking fit.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:16.760]  You try.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.260]  This doesn't fit, guys.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:26.980]  Hang on.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:28.920]  You thought I was fucking done.
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:31.920]  I've only just begun, you son of a bitch.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.800]  We got some.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:35.440]  All right.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:36.000]  Let's try it.
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:36.780]  All right, here we go.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:37.840]  Official stamp.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.720]  Okay, we're pressing, we're pressing.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.520]  Vancouver Child Kicker, first official stamp.
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:50.100]  That looks great.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.400]  That looks just like a real boot.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.640]  That's really cool.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.520]  All right, 50 bucks eBay right now.
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:55.620]  Oh my god, that worked.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:56.960]  Dude, that's so cool.
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.420]  All right, Geoff's gonna do a hundred of these,
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.120]  and he's gonna carry them all around the convention center.
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.100]  Well, I think what we'll do is we'll have Andrew do them, right?
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.460]  He is the Vancouver Child Kicker.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.560]  You're gonna... yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.960]  This... that worked out so well.
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:09.940]  This rules.
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:13.220]  I wanna make posters where we actually do the stamp.
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:14.020]  And then...
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:14.500]  Wow.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.800]  Look at that, it worked out great.
[01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:25.070]  So fucking stupid.
[01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:28.570]  Everything we do, so dumb.
[01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:29.950]  I fucking love it.
[01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:31.290]  Oh, this show's crazy.
[01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:34.290]  All right, let's... we've been going for over an hour, right?
[01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:36.510]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got about... let's say about 20 minutes left.
[01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:38.350]  All right, let's do this box of NBA Illusions,
[01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:39.550]  because I've been waiting to open these.
[01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:41.850]  So how long have you had these and you've been waiting to open them?
[01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:43.790]  Since last year, I think.
[01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:45.150]  Maybe, or maybe early this year.
[01:04:45.290 --> 01:04:46.570]  Yeah, it's been months and months and months.
[01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.310]  Most of this stuff I've had...
[01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:50.310]  I bought this over a year ago, probably, that box.
[01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:51.750]  Then why aren't we opening it?
[01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:53.390]  I just forgot about them.
[01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:55.270]  They're in the center!
[01:04:56.130 --> 01:04:56.910]  Well, now they are.
[01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:02.830]  I had them all in the box, like in the big Tupperware bins,
[01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:05.570]  and then I organized it all and found a whole bunch of shit.
[01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:08.890]  Okay, so this is a box that you got and you've had for a little while.
[01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.210]  Yeah.
[01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:10.010]  How much is in the box?
[01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:14.150]  It is 10 packs per box, 6 cards per pack.
[01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:14.590]  Okay.
[01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:15.910]  This is NBA Illusions.
[01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:17.750]  I believe it is...
[01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:22.650]  gonna be last year's rookies, probably.
[01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:23.410]  All right.
[01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:25.310]  How many are going in the pack sack?
[01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:27.990]  Nice.
[01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:28.530]  Two.
[01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:30.310]  And then we'll open these.
[01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:30.750]  Got it.
[01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:32.950]  Then maybe one or two other randoms.
[01:05:33.110 --> 01:05:34.010]  Yeah, we got some stuff.
[01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:37.730]  Maybe hit that box of Heritage Baseball that I accidentally bought
[01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:40.430]  and spent way too much money on, because I thought I was buying Alan Ginter.
[01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:41.270]  Oh, come on.
[01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:42.470]  Sweet Lou Williams.
[01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.930]  Nice.
[01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:46.230]  Bobby Portis, I do not like.
[01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:49.030]  Here's a black parallel of DeAndre Ayton.
[01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:50.090]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:53.630]  Yeah, he's probably not gonna be a Phoenix Sun next year.
[01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:56.270]  Pascal Siakam.
[01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.930]  Hey, all right.
[01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:59.390]  He used to be a Celtic killer.
[01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:00.430]  That used to drive me crazy.
[01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:02.230]  Trey Jones, we figured him out, though.
[01:06:02.570 --> 01:06:04.430]  And then Jaden McDaniels, rookie.
[01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:06.130]  These cards are cool.
[01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:07.410]  Yeah, they're nice cards.
[01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.910]  I like them.
[01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:09.350]  I'm down with these cards.
[01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:11.430]  I'm a big fan of these cards.
[01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:13.970]  They're shiny.
[01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:16.530]  John Collins.
[01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:21.490]  Chris Stapp's Porzingis, the Unicorn, as they call him.
[01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:24.710]  Probably because you see him on the court about as much as a Unicorn.
[01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:27.250]  Patrick Williams, instant impact rookie.
[01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:28.030]  That's actually nice.
[01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:31.210]  I got a lamello ball of this, number to 25.
[01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:31.850]  Wow, really?
[01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:32.630]  Damn.
[01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:33.530]  That's one of my better pulls.
[01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:37.090]  Evan Fournier, in his brief stint as a useless Celtic.
[01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:40.570]  Oh, Christian Wood.
[01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:43.750]  I think he's probably not gonna be a Rocket next year, either.
[01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.750]  Jordan Lora.
[01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:48.830]  I hope we pull an Al Horford.
[01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:49.770]  Eh, rookies.
[01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:54.350]  Yes, this would be a Oklahoma City Thunder, Al Horford.
[01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.810]  Damn.
[01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:56.010]  Jamal Murray.
[01:06:56.170 --> 01:06:57.070]  I think he's still hurt.
[01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.930]  He's gonna hurt forever.
[01:06:58.270 --> 01:07:00.510]  OG Ananobi, you?
[01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:04.830]  I like Al Horford because I'm the same age as Al Horford, and he's playing in the NBA.
[01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:05.910]  He's doing very well still, too.
[01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:06.610]  That's insane.
[01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:08.030]  Tyler Hero, Black Parallel.
[01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:10.070]  Ooh, I hate him, but that's a great looking card.
[01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.570]  Yeah, that's a great card.
[01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:12.310]  Least favorite player in the NBA.
[01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:12.990]  Most punchable face.
[01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:13.730]  Yeah, 100%.
[01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:14.730]  Joe Ingalls.
[01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:17.150]  Uh, ooh, Desmond Bain.
[01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:19.810]  Boy, he turned out to be a hell of a fucking basketball player.
[01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:22.130]  Especially for a mid-first rounder.
[01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:23.850]  Uh, Isaiah Joe.
[01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:26.710]  I really like these cards.
[01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.850]  These are very cool.
[01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.090]  These are very cool cards.
[01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:30.330]  Have fun with them?
[01:07:30.450 --> 01:07:31.430]  Yeah, you know, enjoy them.
[01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:32.030]  Do whatever you do.
[01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:33.730]  They're for you, too.
[01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:34.930]  I'm good, I think I got them.
[01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:35.670]  Andre Drummond.
[01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:37.770]  Devin Booker.
[01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:40.290]  Serge Ibaka.
[01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:41.010]  All right.
[01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:43.930]  He, uh, was in an Action Bronson song once.
[01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:44.870]  Hell yeah.
[01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:46.270]  Uh, CJ McCollum.
[01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:50.470]  Nikola Jokic, MVP there.
[01:07:51.030 --> 01:07:55.590]  And then Devin Vassell, who is, uh, pretty good, but playing for San Antonio.
[01:07:55.850 --> 01:07:56.150]  Sorry, Nick.
[01:07:56.730 --> 01:07:57.050]  Ouch.
[01:07:58.030 --> 01:07:58.590]  He left.
[01:07:58.810 --> 01:07:59.150]  Oh, good.
[01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:03.150]  As I was saying that, I was like, all right, he's a fucking nigger.
[01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:04.690]  Can you believe he's a Spurs?
[01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:06.130]  Like, I get it, but like, damn.
[01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:06.590]  I get it, too.
[01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.870]  Jalen Brown.
[01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:09.110]  Yeah, I knew you were hanging onto that one.
[01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:10.150]  Only bright spot of the fuck.
[01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:11.190]  Well, except we can't dribble.
[01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:13.870]  Uh, DeMontis Sabonis.
[01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:15.150]  He shot well.
[01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:16.390]  Anthony Davis.
[01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:17.630]  Ooh, I like that card.
[01:08:17.790 --> 01:08:22.370]  I'm not, you know, don't know if I'm a big AD guy, but, uh, they're a great looking card.
[01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:23.150]  Yeah, beautiful card.
[01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:25.630]  So, uh, oh, here you go.
[01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:27.110]  Zion, year two card.
[01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:27.670]  Nice.
[01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:28.430]  Who knows?
[01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:29.550]  Who knows, Zion?
[01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:30.850]  It's kind of how that feels, huh?
[01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:31.630]  Peyton Pritchard.
[01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:36.710]  Fast P, or, uh, B-Rabbit, or PP, as they call him.
[01:08:36.730 --> 01:08:37.610]  That's this guy, right.
[01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:37.870]  Yep.
[01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:38.110]  Yeah.
[01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:40.530]  And then, uh, Denny Athesia.
[01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:42.930]  Who I believe is, uh, Israeli.
[01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.650]  Yeah.
[01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:44.990]  Yeah.
[01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:48.450]  Uh, three more packs of this.
[01:08:48.570 --> 01:08:48.830]  Okay.
[01:08:49.150 --> 01:08:50.370]  See what fun stuff we get.
[01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:57.590]  Uh, Kelly Oubre Jr. Uh, he is the current NBA's Mr. Steal Your Girl.
[01:08:57.770 --> 01:08:58.310]  Mm, nice.
[01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.830]  As they say.
[01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:00.150]  Uh, Jarrett Allen.
[01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:01.750]  Very, very, very cool dude.
[01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:02.350]  Cool dude.
[01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:03.570]  Uh, gamer.
[01:09:03.730 --> 01:09:04.050]  Big gamer.
[01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:04.390]  Yeah.
[01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:06.050]  Career lineage.
[01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:08.610]  We got, looks like KD and KD.
[01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:09.050]  Mm-hmm.
[01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:10.810]  Here he is through his whole career.
[01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:13.030]  Or the likable KD from OKC.
[01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:13.390]  Yeah.
[01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:17.130]  Both of them are on Twitter defending himself.
[01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.470]  Right.
[01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:19.630]  There's two Twitter accounts right there.
[01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:20.750]  Well, you can tell there's two of them.
[01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:22.710]  One's a, one's a burner account and one's him.
[01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:24.550]  Alexey Pokachevsky here.
[01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:24.910]  Rookie.
[01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:25.830]  Everybody loves him.
[01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:26.930]  He's seven feet tall.
[01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:29.150]  Uh, Theo Maladon.
[01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:29.690]  All right.
[01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:32.330]  Who's probably gonna have a good career in the NBA.
[01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:33.610]  Getting down to two more packs.
[01:09:34.290 --> 01:09:35.090]  Oh boy.
[01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:37.310]  How you feeling about these?
[01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:38.050]  Feeling good.
[01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:40.010]  We haven't gotten an auto yet and I think we're supposed to.
[01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:40.270]  Okay.
[01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:42.410]  So, uh, maybe?
[01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:42.970]  Maybe not.
[01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:45.510]  Uh, Darius Baisley.
[01:09:46.650 --> 01:09:47.310]  Kimba Walker.
[01:09:49.650 --> 01:09:52.090]  You, did you just reluctantly hold on to that?
[01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:54.390]  Uh-huh.
[01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:55.630]  This is a big, this is a big hit.
[01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:57.270]  Uh, Anthony Edwards.
[01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.630]  Okay.
[01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:59.570]  Rookie, uh, Black Parallel.
[01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:00.010]  Nice.
[01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:01.010]  That's fucking awesome.
[01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:03.990]  Yeah, I gotta, I have to hold on to all the Celtics cards, but Kimba was...
[01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:05.510]  Karis Levert.
[01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:06.450]  Always really liked him.
[01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:07.750]  Uh, Malachi Flynn.
[01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:09.210]  Not even in the NBA anymore, I don't think.
[01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:10.830]  And Udoka Azeboki.
[01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:12.870]  Hey, look, it's Barbara.
[01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:18.930]  We made a Vancouver child kicker stamp and, uh, stamped it.
[01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:20.130]  Look what we got.
[01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:22.850]  Whoa!
[01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:23.630]  So we can make...
[01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:24.270]  Is that person in use?
[01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.750]  Yeah.
[01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:25.450]  Oh, that's very cool.
[01:10:25.450 --> 01:10:26.170]  We tested our first one.
[01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:26.490]  On my Instagram.
[01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:28.730]  Oh shit, we're on, uh...
[01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:30.350]  Yeah, we're on roosterteeth.com.
[01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:31.570]  Say hello, Instagram.
[01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:35.950]  Hey, Instagram, say hello, YouTube and Rooster Teeth.
[01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:38.410]  Whoa, stream-ception.
[01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:46.010]  I noticed it too, I just didn't say anything.
[01:10:46.330 --> 01:10:47.250]  It was pretty, it was pretty nice.
[01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:48.730]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.470]  Yeah, I got you.
[01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:51.030]  Bye!
[01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:54.950]  Thank you, Fred Van Vliet.
[01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:56.830]  Oh, I like your Instagram.
[01:10:57.690 --> 01:10:58.370]  Terry Rozier.
[01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:00.430]  I like Fred Van Vliet, he's a little dude.
[01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:04.610]  Uh, Ricky Reflections, Bam and Onyeka.
[01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:05.510]  Keep that.
[01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:06.590]  Drew Holiday.
[01:11:07.650 --> 01:11:08.550]  He's so good.
[01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:11.610]  Jalen Brunson, also pretty good.
[01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:13.150]  And Tyrese Halliburton rookie.
[01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:15.150]  What a big one there was, Anthony.
[01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:18.530]  I was watching, uh, when we did this at RTX...
[01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:20.350]  last year?
[01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:23.750]  And it was during World Cup stuff or whatever.
[01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:27.230]  And Drew Holiday is the card that we were talking about when, I think,
[01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:30.450]  England got a goal, like a goal scored on them or something.
[01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:31.450]  And it was just Gavin going,
[01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.770]  No!
[01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:33.410]  We didn't bring it home.
[01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.930]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:35.650]  It's not coming home.
[01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:36.590]  Russell Westbrook.
[01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:37.450]  Nice.
[01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:39.650]  That's my guy right there.
[01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:40.150]  Look at that.
[01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:41.790]  This guy can't go up.
[01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:42.710]  Oh, what the...
[01:11:43.210 --> 01:11:43.790]  He's like...
[01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:44.870]  How am I going to defend that?
[01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.830]  Brandon Ingram.
[01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:51.270]  You let him shoot, man.
[01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:52.370]  PJ Tucker.
[01:11:52.570 --> 01:11:53.910]  PJ Tucker, I think, is about to...
[01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:56.070]  said he's leaving, uh, Miami.
[01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:57.030]  Wants to test the...
[01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.570]  Oh, really?
[01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:58.650]  Yeah, Desmond Bain.
[01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:59.430]  I thought that was strange.
[01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:00.930]  Peyton Pritchard, second year card.
[01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.990]  Jason Tatum.
[01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:03.010]  Oh, wow, you got...
[01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:03.470]  Celtics.
[01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:05.390]  They always appear next to each other in this.
[01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:06.950]  For some reason.
[01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:08.570]  Uh, Kendrick Nunn.
[01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:11.350]  He is, uh...
[01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:13.010]  He's in, like, a Polo G song I listen to.
[01:12:13.410 --> 01:12:13.630]  What?
[01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:15.010]  A lot of NBA players.
[01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:15.670]  A lot of, like...
[01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:20.490]  A lot of, like, C-level NBA players showing up in rap songs these days.
[01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.270]  I just meant, like, you're listening to that?
[01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.730]  All right, cool.
[01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:24.370]  Do you listen to Polo G?
[01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:25.150]  No, I just wasn't...
[01:12:25.150 --> 01:12:27.430]  That's not, like, the lane that I expected for you.
[01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:28.310]  Just saying.
[01:12:28.450 --> 01:12:29.230]  Polo G's fucking awesome.
[01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:30.190]  PJ Washington Jr.
[01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:31.810]  Jay Crowder again.
[01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:33.210]  Trey Young again.
[01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:34.990]  We've already said stuff about these guys.
[01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:35.990]  Grayshin Jr. again.
[01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:36.990]  All the same cards.
[01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.150]  Uh, Wendell Carter Jr.
[01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:39.650]  Great.
[01:12:39.970 --> 01:12:41.310]  The thing about him is he's a junior.
[01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:43.230]  Uh, Norman Powell.
[01:12:43.730 --> 01:12:44.450]  Cole Anthony.
[01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:47.490]  He's the dude whose dad was an animal and mixtape dude.
[01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:48.610]  Oh, really?
[01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:49.110]  Yeah.
[01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:49.810]  Oh, that's sick.
[01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:51.430]  He's one of those dunkers.
[01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:52.550]  Malcolm Brogdon.
[01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:55.150]  Uh, Facundo Campozzo.

[01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:57.390]  Gordon Hayward.
[01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:58.590]  Somehow still in the NBA.
[01:12:59.090 --> 01:13:00.410]  Uh, Terrence Mann.
[01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.650]  Uh, Tyler O'Hero again.

[01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:04.570]  Kevin Love.
[01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:06.430]  Going gray gracefully.
[01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.670]  Yeah.
[01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:07.110]  I appreciate it.
[01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:08.070]  Jordan Clarkson.
[01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.950]  Doing it for us.

[01:13:11.210 --> 01:13:12.730]  Uh, oh, Daniel Gafford.
[01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:13.970]  Here we go.
[01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:16.350]  Uh, Daron Sharp.
[01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:17.150]  Pull that.
[01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:18.950]  Uh, Jalen Suggs.
[01:13:18.970 --> 01:13:19.570]  That's a good rookie.
[01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:23.070]  Suggy, I imagine they might call him.
[01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.730]  I don't know.
[01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:25.950]  I'm not a magic fan.
[01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:27.750]  But if I were a fan, I'd call him Suggy.
[01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:29.190]  They got magic fans?
[01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:29.850]  That's crazy.
[01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:31.170]  Jason Preston.
[01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:34.150]  Uh, I think there are tourists who go to Orlando.

[01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:35.310]  Have a nice weekend.
[01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:36.130]  I'm a Disney fan.
[01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:36.950]  Moses Moody.
[01:13:37.150 --> 01:13:37.450]  Mm-hmm.

[01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:45.190]  Thank you.
[01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:46.210]  Oh, boy.
[01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:46.930]  Oh.
[01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:53.650]  Is that it?
[01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.010]  It's the lady.
[01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:55.410]  Oh, no.
[01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:56.010]  Oh.
[01:13:59.190 --> 01:13:59.550]  Um...
[01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:00.370]  Hi there.
[01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:01.050]  Nope, close enough.
[01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:02.110]  All right, moving on.
[01:14:02.210 --> 01:14:02.890]  Can't find it.
[01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:06.010]  There's a Bill Russell insert.
[01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:10.030]  Uh, and a doo-doo Kevin Porter Jr.
[01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:11.010]  Insert.
[01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.970]  Nope, we've had room shots.
[01:14:13.050 --> 01:14:13.750]  We haven't been using them.
[01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:16.130]  How about this?
[01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:17.830]  How about some Ghostbusters 2?
[01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:18.850]  Who are you gonna call?
[01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:24.630]  Have you seen that TikTok where the, like, the, like, Transformers on fire or whatever,
[01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:26.250]  up on, like, the, like, the telephone pole?
[01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:26.570]  Uh-huh.
[01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:28.470]  And they go, who are you, who are we gonna call?
[01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:29.430]  And somebody goes, Ghostbusters.
[01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:30.710]  And it fucking explodes.
[01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:32.490]  Like, the timing is perfect.
[01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:33.370]  It's really great.
[01:14:34.190 --> 01:14:35.630]  Merry Christmas, New York.
[01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:36.090]  All right.
[01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:39.250]  Uh, oh, what is his name?
[01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:40.770]  Janos?
[01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.890]  What a trip.
[01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:43.190]  Or Janos?
[01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.670]  Mm-hmm.
[01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:45.410]  Uh, that's right, Ghostbusters.
[01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:49.510]  We're back and we're better than ever, with twice the know-how and twice the particle
[01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:52.710]  power to deal with all your supernatural elimination needs.

[01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:54.790]  Said Dan Aykroyd.
[01:14:54.810 --> 01:14:55.350]  Yeah, Decroyed.
[01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.650]  Yeah.
[01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:57.950]  Here's some Slimer artwork.
[01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:00.470]  Wow, an original onion head?
[01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:01.230]  That's incredible.
[01:15:01.890 --> 01:15:04.390]  Oh, here's a sticker of the boys.
[01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:06.250]  Liking that.

[01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:09.630]  Sorry, guys.
[01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:10.450]  Classic.
[01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:11.970]  I ate all the hot dogs.
[01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:13.270]  Classic Slimer.
[01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:14.450]  You're keeping the Slimers, huh?
[01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:17.190]  Yeah, he's the star of Ghostbusters.
[01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:19.910]  Eat this, Viggo.
[01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:21.670]  It was Viggo Mortensen.
[01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:24.690]  Yeah, Viggo Mortensen was in that and then he was in Easter Promise.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.240]  Ghostbusters on trial.
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:37.760]  They're real different movies.
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:39.120]  They're very different movies.
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:42.160]  You know that dude was married to Eggzine Cervanca?
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:42.780]  Really?
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.760]  Yeah, for a long time.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:43.920]  Oh, wow.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.420]  They're divorced now, but yeah, for a really long time.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.880]  All right, what's one that you want to get into?
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.320]  We got, we got 10.
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.440]  Let's say we got 10 minutes.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.040]  Let's open up this box of heritage.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.920]  This expensive, the expensive box that you don't want.
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:54.620]  Let's do it.
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:54.900]  Yeah.
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:56.520]  It's not that I don't want it.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.520]  That it was the wrong thing?
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.020]  Yeah, it's that I didn't want it.
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.060]  Now that I have it, I'm like, I don't mind having it.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.260]  It's just that it's not what I wanted.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.280]  And I'm just fucking, I get, uh...
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:07.720]  Uh-huh.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:08.580]  Mad?
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:12.440]  Well, I get scatterbrained when I'm trying to do a lot of things at once.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:12.800]  No!
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.400]  I got my head in a lot of places.
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:15.180]  Who are you talking about?
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:15.880]  And so I just bought the wrong fucking thing.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.100]  You?
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:17.180]  There you go.
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:18.760]  How about a Ronald Akuna Jr.
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:21.440]  Big-ass card, as we call them.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.260]  You gonna sleeve that?
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.780]  I think I have a sleeve at home.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.620]  I hope I do.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.020]  Uh, we'll open...
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:28.240]  Okay, so what are we, there you go.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.240]  So what are we anticipating getting in this?
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:34.140]  Well, what we were looking for was the world's biggest airplane
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:35.560]  from the Alan and Ginter set.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.320]  Oh, that's right.
[01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:37.360]  And you did not buy that.
[01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:38.180]  No, but I bought these.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:38.400]  Yeah.
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:39.020]  So, uh...
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:41.000]  Do these have sharks in them, or is it just baseball?
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.860]  I think they're just, just baseball.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.440]  Those maybe were the craziest things you've ever opened.
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:46.320]  I think were shark ones, actually.
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:47.320]  It was like, here's...
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.320]  Franz Ferdinand being shot!
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.080]  Ozzie Albies!
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:55.640]  And you're like, what the fuck is going on?
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:57.100]  Arthur Ashe, tennis legend.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:16:59.520]  Okay.
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:02.300]  We'll open up these guys to close it out.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:02.940]  All right.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:03.540]  All right.
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:04.260]  Very exciting.
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.280]  At least it's this year's baseball.
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:07.260]  Hooray!
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:08.060]  Oh!
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:09.920]  Are they cool looking?
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:10.860]  Uh, yes.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:11.320]  Oh, great.
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:13.900]  Emmanuel, uh, Clace?
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:14.900]  Is that how you say that?
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:15.040]  Yep.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:16.960]  Mike Trout?
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:17.420]  Nice!
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.440]  Quietly the best player in baseball.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:22.120]  TJ Freidel.
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:23.940]  They say he might be the best player of all time, huh?
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:25.480]  He's probably up there.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.360]  I think he loves playing Anaheim, because nobody gives a fuck,
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:28.380]  and he doesn't have to deal with anyone.
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:29.160]  Really?
[01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:29.600]  Yeah.
[01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:30.320]  I think it's great.
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.560]  Mike Mustaska?
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:32.180]  Musta?
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.060]  Moos-ta?
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:34.480]  Moos-ta-cus?
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:35.080]  Moos-ta-cus.
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:35.500]  There you go.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.180]  There you go. Nailed it.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:37.520]  Yohan Lakata.
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:38.760]  Jesse Chavez.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.340]  Oh, right, he said I could do it the right way.
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:41.220]  Jane Beaver.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:42.880]  And, hey, Mookie Betts.
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:44.060]  Boom.
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.900]  Speaking of, everybody's favorite Dodgers.
[01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:49.560]  I'm liking the Dodgers, man.
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.740]  I'm enjoying being a Dodgers fan.
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:52.520]  You said you weren't even watching baseball!
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:54.580]  Uh, I'm starting to get back into it this year.
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.460]  I watched them last year.
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.360]  Rooted for them all the way.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:58.600]  Fuck that.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.080]  Bo Bichette.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.300]  He's a blue jay.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.420]  It's, uh...
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:03.000]  Jordan Montgomery.
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:05.140]  Aaron Judge.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:06.760]  Bo Bichette's one of those kids.
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:09.300]  He's one of the baseball player kids that are on that team.
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:09.800]  Like Vlad.
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:10.600]  Like Vlad Jr.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:11.260]  Yeah.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:11.880]  Bo Bichette.
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:12.400]  What is it?
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:13.440]  Biggio's kid?
[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:14.340]  Or Bagwell's kid?
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:14.920]  One of the two.
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:16.120]  It's, like, crazy.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:18.680]  Lars Neutbar.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:19.980]  Yeah, Lars Neutbar!
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:21.140]  Great baseball name!
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.000]  Great baseball name.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.520]  Kyle Seeger.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.140]  Oh, here we go.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:25.700]  This is cool.
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:26.520]  Here's a...
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:26.960]  What we got?
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.160]  Numbered 573.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.640]  Here's a Walker Bueller.
[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.120]  Like, I guess, like, chrome.
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:35.360]  It almost feels like an old metal card.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.380]  That's kind of cool.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:36.860]  Yeah.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.120]  And then...
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.840]  Oh, did you know that Dylan Carlson is a new age performer?
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:43.000]  He's into Reiki.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:44.700]  Crystal therapy.
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:46.760]  Yeah, cool.
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.620]  Oh, you know, he does...
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:49.640]  He says sound baths.
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:50.120]  Oh, wow.
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:50.820]  He's kind of like...
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:51.180]  He's like a...
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:52.440]  He's a Gua Sha practitioner.
[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:53.200]  That's pretty great.
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:54.080]  Willie Castro.
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:55.660]  And, uh...
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:57.540]  Oh, did you know that Hernandez's hit decided it?
[01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:58.280]  I don't know what it decided.
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:18:59.600]  What the fuck?
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.340]  I don't like solid socks on baseball players.
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.080]  I think they should go back to stirrups.
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:07.240]  I don't like solid socks.
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:07.560]  I like stirrups.
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:10.160]  I'm fine with stance socks, because at least there's something.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.320]  I don't like the solid sock look.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:12.940]  All right, I'll let it go.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:13.560]  I think it sucks.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:14.260]  Right there with you.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.200]  Chris Taylor.
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.360]  Ozzy Albies.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:16.660]  Hey.
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:17.760]  John Lester.
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:19.980]  Griffin Jacks, rookie.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:20.620]  Take that.
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:22.860]  Martin Maldonado.
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:23.960]  Will Smith.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:24.600]  Different Will Smith.
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:26.740]  Another new age performer.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.160]  Really into, uh...
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.740]  Really into, uh...
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:32.360]  You got it.
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:32.980]  John Tesh.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:33.580]  There you go.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.480]  Corbin Burns.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:36.500]  Will Smith.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.420]  I was struggling there for a second.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.200]  You got it.
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:39.960]  Oh, that's a fat pack.
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:42.380]  Yeah, why?
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.480]  It's got a mem card in it, probably.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.120]  A what?
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.240]  Mem card.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:46.720]  Oh!
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:47.500]  Relic.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:48.340]  Some...
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:49.820]  Guys, there's a mem card.
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.080]  What we got?
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:56.400]  We got DJ Peters.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:56.720]  Okay.
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:58.000]  We got Jesus Lizardo.
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:19:58.800]  Good baseball name.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.720]  Uh, Edmundo Sosa.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:02.760]  Is he related to Sandy Sosa?
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:03.840]  I don't know.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:04.680]  Probably not.
[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:05.220]  Probably not.
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:07.260]  Uh, Michael Pineda.
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:09.760]  Uh, Brian Goodwin.
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:13.600]  Uh, Brandon Finding Nemo.
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:15.740]  Pablo Lopez.
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.460]  Alec Mills.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.400]  And Lamont Wade.
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:21.740]  All right, we're gonna open this little guy.
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.280]  We're gonna save the fat one for last.
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:24.840]  You want that?
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.560]  No, just looking at Alec Mills.
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.020]  Bummer.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.760]  What's a bummer about him?
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:34.040]  His glasses, his chin hair, his whole look.
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:35.800]  He's got...
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:36.960]  Yeah.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.320]  He's kind of got that insult look.
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:43.620]  Is this the one with memes or whatever?
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.260]  No, it's the next one.
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:46.140]  I'm building up anticipation.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.200]  Nick Pavetta.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:48.700]  Miles Straw!
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:54.560]  Oh, I yelled at Miles Straw at a Round Rock Express game when he tried to steal second,
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:56.040]  and it was a foul ball.
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:57.480]  And then we yelled, like, do it again!
[01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:58.440]  You can't steal second!
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:02.500]  And then he got thrown out, and he was pissed that we yelled at him.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.460]  He was mad.
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:08.980]  He was not thrilled.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:12.500]  He was probably, like, 24, and we were just fucking screaming at this guy.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.160]  That's awesome.
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.040]  I think about him all the time.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:14.660]  Well, fuck him.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:15.400]  Jordan Alvarez.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:18.920]  Sandy Alcantara.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.320]  I wonder if he's related to Sandy Alomar.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:21.600]  Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:22.800]  Same first name.
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:24.360]  Ryan Yarborough.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:27.760]  Seth Beer.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:28.300]  Yeah.
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:29.380]  Goes in the condiments.
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.680]  I don't think you know what condiments are.
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:33.820]  A beer could be a condiment.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.200]  This is fucked.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:36.740]  It was a sauce.
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:37.240]  Please don't.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.400]  I'm glad no one...
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.780]  If the other guys were here, we'd be in a fight.
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.120]  Well, they're not.
[01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:42.520]  They can't be bothered to show up to work.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:46.520]  Chris Flexon and Miguel Rojas.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:47.020]  All right.
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:51.080]  All right.
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:52.440]  This is it.
[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:53.960]  I hope we get a Lubob.
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:55.500]  This is the last fucking...
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:56.440]  I would like a Lubob as well.
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:58.200]  This is the last fucking pack we're opening.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.000]  And we got mims.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:21:59.600]  We're done.
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:01.680]  What do we got?
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:03.240]  What are we looking at?
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.220]  Lars Hendricks and Mark Melancon.
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:06.560]  No, Mark Melanson.
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:07.140]  Yes.
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:07.800]  Don't worry about it.
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:08.460]  Melancon.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.580]  They were a Swedish punk band.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.200]  Yes, they were.

[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:14.860]  Fran Milreyes.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.120]  Hey, Franimal!
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.000]  He was great.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:17.940]  Don't they call him the Franimal?
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:19.360]  Yeah, he was a former padre.
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.000]  He was great.
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:20.420]  Awesome.
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.400]  Charismatic dude.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:21.900]  A lot of fun.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:22.520]  I like that name.
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:23.000]  I like him.
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:24.360]  Mason Thompson.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:25.740]  He looks like a mason.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.100]  He's a high-length gig.
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:29.680]  Hyunjin Roo.
[01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:33.380]  Oh, Randy Rezaena did something.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.400]  Alfonso Rivas.
[01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:37.160]  Why'd you save that one?
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:38.100]  He's a rookie.
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:39.820]  Austin Hayes.
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:41.320]  Victor Robles.
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:43.740]  Pete Alonso.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:44.340]  All right.
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:46.380]  Wow.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:47.840]  Look at this.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:48.260]  What'd you get?
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.240]  Look at this fucking Patton Smith photo.
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:52.000]  Oh, no.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:52.820]  Oh, yeah.
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:55.480]  This guy looks like he's in the band Puddle of Mud.
[01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:56.200]  Yeah, he does.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.460]  He looks pissed that he's, like, doing this.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.780]  He does not want to take this photo.
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:02.220]  I have to play fucking baseball?
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:03.640]  He is.
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:04.300]  Sorry, Pavan.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:04.840]  Angry.
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:06.780]  Michael Perez.
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.000]  Eugenio Suarez.
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.940]  And I'm gonna use Justin Verlander.
[01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:11.380]  Okay.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:12.320]  Who is, uh...
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.620]  Can you believe he's still playing?
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.360]  That's absolutely insane.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:17.940]  I'm gonna use him to...
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:18.820]  Married to Kate Upton.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:19.740]  Married to Kate Upton.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:20.760]  And just...
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:21.560]  It's probably his greatest accomplishment.
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:22.100]  Still playing.
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:23.280]  What are you...
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:23.700]  That's like...
[01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:24.260]  This is how they do it.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:26.340]  We've got Clubhouse Collection.
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:26.600]  Okay.
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:27.940]  You go like, oh, it's a Yankee!
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:28.720]  It's a Yankee!
[01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:29.660]  Oh, it's a Yankee!
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:30.780]  Oh, please be Jeter!
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:31.700]  Oh, please be Jeter!
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:32.360]  Oh, Gary Cole!

[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:33.620]  There you go.
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:34.000]  Bummer.
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:34.920]  Oh, but that's cool.
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:35.520]  It's a two-color patch, though.
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:38.340]  I mean, he was good for a while.
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:38.840]  Yeah.
[01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:39.940]  He's trying.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:42.560]  Hey, that's all we can ask of any of them.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:43.780]  Just try their best.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:47.780]  That was a hell of an unboxing.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:48.780]  Yeah, we got...
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:49.940]  We covered a lot of ground today.
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:50.300]  Yeah.
