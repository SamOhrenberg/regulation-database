[00:10.440 --> 00:14.620]  Hello and welcome to another episode of The F*** Face Break Show.
[00:14.800 --> 00:19.040]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, is my wife Emily and producer Eric.
[00:19.920 --> 00:23.480]  And it's just a regular old week here at The Break Show. Nothing special.
[00:23.940 --> 00:25.020]  Eric's been in a really good mood today.
[00:25.260 --> 00:28.800]  He's keeping his f***ing mouth shut for once, which is a nice change of pace, I gotta admit.
[00:29.020 --> 00:32.440]  He usually has a snide comment and an opinion about everything.
[00:32.880 --> 00:34.320]  Yeah, but he's been really sweet today.
[00:34.960 --> 00:39.500]  Yeah, this is maybe my favorite version of Eric thus far.
[00:39.500 --> 00:45.280]  I mean, let's be honest, the guy basically exists to shill merchandise for another podcast anyway.
[00:45.480 --> 00:45.880]  That's true.
[00:46.420 --> 00:49.340]  At least he's doing it quietly today, right?
[00:49.520 --> 00:52.260]  Yeah. I mean, at least he's got some f***face merch on.
[00:52.560 --> 00:52.880]  That's true.
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.200]  Well, you know, he's contractually obligated to at least pretend like he gives a shit about this podcast while he secretly works on the other one.
[01:00.220 --> 01:01.160]  That's true. That's true.
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.600]  Anyway, we're gonna open up a little bit of mail. We got a pack sack.
[01:04.780 --> 01:08.840]  And then I think we'll just continue with what we were doing last week.
[01:08.840 --> 01:10.880]  Which was zoning you out.
[01:13.920 --> 01:24.760]  If you weren't around last week, I wanted to do this experiment where I bought one of every kind of pack or box you can buy of 2024 Topps Baseball Series 1.
[01:24.900 --> 01:32.180]  So that we can kind of open them all together and see what we get and figure out maybe by the end of it where your best value is, where your worst value is.
[01:32.600 --> 01:35.320]  It's all balls deep. Just all baseballs.
[01:35.320 --> 01:41.640]  I'm starting to suspect that your worst value is just always being in this collectible scene.
[01:44.320 --> 01:48.960]  But we've been going from least expensive to most expensive packs, right?
[01:49.000 --> 01:49.100]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:49.100 --> 01:52.060]  So hopefully this week we should be getting some good stuff.
[01:52.200 --> 01:58.320]  Yeah, we'll see. Or I'll just be here going like, that was disappointing.
[01:58.600 --> 01:59.460]  What did you work on today?
[02:02.720 --> 02:03.940]  Thanks for asking, Emily.
[02:04.620 --> 02:08.580]  I edited an episode of So All Right. Listen to it on Tuesdays.
[02:08.820 --> 02:11.060]  Yeah? What else did we work on?
[02:11.780 --> 02:12.600]  You went to work.
[02:12.820 --> 02:13.340]  I did go to work.
[02:13.420 --> 02:14.760]  You went and did hair salon stuff.
[02:14.900 --> 02:15.260]  That's true.
[02:15.460 --> 02:15.600]  Yeah.
[02:15.840 --> 02:16.100]  Okay.
[02:17.020 --> 02:18.940]  I also... Emily has made me...
[02:19.480 --> 02:23.080]  I've not made. I have encouraged and...
[02:23.080 --> 02:23.880]  Violently encouraged.
[02:24.120 --> 02:29.000]  Violently encouraged and been really motivating towards...
[02:29.460 --> 02:35.280]  So, like, if we're going to continue with your at-home hobby of collecting cards,
[02:35.460 --> 02:37.780]  there's a lot of cards that you don't really want.
[02:37.920 --> 02:38.820]  Almost all of them.
[02:39.060 --> 02:42.720]  Right. But you keep all your Marcus Smarts, which, shout out to Brandon.
[02:43.020 --> 02:45.540]  Still super fan, amazing Brandon, who sent all those Marcus Smarts cards to us.
[02:45.560 --> 02:48.720]  I have them right here. I brought them with me again today so I can put them around me.
[02:48.720 --> 02:49.540]  They're amazing.
[02:50.200 --> 02:52.040]  The cards Brandon got me are right here.
[02:52.260 --> 02:53.160]  And all your Celtics cards.
[02:53.300 --> 02:56.840]  But, you know, sometimes when you're pulling your cards and looking for Marcus Smart or Celtics,
[02:56.960 --> 03:00.600]  you get a lot of Wembys and you get a lot of...
[03:00.600 --> 03:01.060]  Other people.
[03:01.260 --> 03:02.720]  Lucas and...
[03:02.720 --> 03:04.360]  Anyway, you made me start an eBay store.
[03:04.620 --> 03:06.680]  I made you start an eBay store, yeah.
[03:06.760 --> 03:14.280]  I encouraged it of, like, again, let's just kind of one in, one out and see if we can get some things moving along.
[03:14.280 --> 03:16.540]  So, uh, at Geoff...
[03:16.540 --> 03:19.320]  First of all, I was in charge of making the name and it's horrible and I'm sorry.
[03:19.860 --> 03:21.220]  I said, how about Geoff Ramsey Collectibles?
[03:21.340 --> 03:24.100]  And she said, cool, Geoff Ramsey Collectibles 3.
[03:24.300 --> 03:26.260]  Because they want to let me do Geoff Ramsey Collectibles.
[03:26.600 --> 03:28.560]  And so I put 3, that's my favorite number.
[03:28.860 --> 03:31.320]  So whoever you 1 and 2 are out there, I'm fucking coming for you.
[03:31.360 --> 03:33.500]  Anyway, that's personal shit, that's not this.
[03:34.180 --> 03:38.600]  But if you... and it's not even fuck-face related.
[03:38.600 --> 03:38.840]  No.
[03:38.920 --> 03:39.840]  It's just my personal cards.
[03:39.840 --> 03:44.720]  I've been hiding, trying to hide from you how much there are.
[03:44.980 --> 03:48.080]  I don't let you go in my closet, but it's starting to... it's bursting.
[03:48.300 --> 03:52.520]  That's where it's just kind of the, like, let's just kind of get some things moving of the things that you don't want.
[03:52.560 --> 03:54.700]  Because there are people that do want them.
[03:54.800 --> 03:55.060]  Yeah.
[03:55.300 --> 04:00.340]  Like, you want everyone's Marcus Smart cards, but they might want your Luca or your Jalen, whatever he is.
[04:00.820 --> 04:03.440]  I don't know, but anyways, Geoff Ramsey Collectibles 3.
[04:03.740 --> 04:04.180]  Thank you.
[04:04.860 --> 04:06.300]  But what did I get? What's in my bag?
[04:06.300 --> 04:07.300]  Well, let's open up.
[04:07.620 --> 04:10.700]  Burndog actually gave us a little care package this week.
[04:10.980 --> 04:13.900]  Burndog, who is... who was in the trucks video.
[04:14.340 --> 04:18.300]  Yeah, who plays trucks with me and who's supposed to be making a bowl of cereal for Vanessa.
[04:19.020 --> 04:21.740]  Vanessa, who's in Collect My Pearls podcast with me.
[04:22.420 --> 04:27.160]  She told me about how she asked Burndog to make her a bowl of cereal, and he didn't.
[04:27.720 --> 04:31.180]  And because he was like, the brood show's about to start, so Bernie, make her a bowl of cereal.
[04:31.640 --> 04:33.960]  Or she's, you know, she's an adult, she can make her own.
[04:34.320 --> 04:35.060]  All right, here we go.
[04:35.960 --> 04:37.840]  Oh, you got this one again.
[04:38.300 --> 04:38.660]  Rajah.
[04:39.660 --> 04:40.020]  Rajah.
[04:40.160 --> 04:41.860]  Well, I'm sorry, still no Marie.
[04:42.240 --> 04:46.460]  What else did Burndog get us? We can see other kind of wacky stuff.
[04:46.660 --> 04:48.540]  Ooh, what's that? Let's have this one.
[04:48.840 --> 04:53.000]  This could be world's smallest micro collections.
[04:53.120 --> 04:55.260]  It could be Barbie, Care Bears, or My Little Pony.
[04:55.520 --> 04:56.600]  Ooh, I like Barbie.
[04:56.680 --> 04:58.120]  All three I know Bernie's a big fan of.
[04:59.280 --> 05:00.000]  Let's see.
[05:00.300 --> 05:02.580]  I think about Rajah on this side or on the other side.
[05:02.760 --> 05:04.320]  Oh my goodness, there's tons of stuff in here.
[05:04.740 --> 05:06.980]  There's a book, I don't want to read.
[05:07.300 --> 05:07.960]  All right, what do we got?
[05:11.580 --> 05:13.680]  Ooh, shit, there's a lot of stuff in here.
[05:14.560 --> 05:16.460]  Oh my, I didn't get the Barbie with the rollerblades.
[05:16.620 --> 05:19.520]  We didn't, we got the Care Bear with the heart on it.
[05:19.980 --> 05:20.980]  Which one's that one?
[05:22.080 --> 05:23.200]  That's Artery Bear.
[05:25.080 --> 05:25.800]  Arterial Bear.
[05:26.860 --> 05:31.840]  And it comes with, oh look, it comes with a magnifying glass so you can actually fucking see it.
[05:31.900 --> 05:32.520]  I love that.
[05:32.700 --> 05:33.940]  If you're in your 40s like me.
[05:34.340 --> 05:35.040]  Oh, that's adorable.
[05:35.060 --> 05:37.420]  It's not even listed on here as under the Care Bears.
[05:37.620 --> 05:38.540]  Maybe it's a super rare.
[05:38.760 --> 05:40.260]  Oh, it's probably the rarest of the bear.
[05:41.940 --> 05:44.080]  Oh yeah, it says right here on the back, worth $1 billion.
[05:44.680 --> 05:45.080]  That's cool.
[05:45.220 --> 05:46.220]  We'll put that on our eBay store.
[05:46.700 --> 05:47.240]  Let me see.
[05:47.460 --> 05:48.260]  You want to look at your little guy?
[05:48.260 --> 05:48.540]  Well, yeah.
[05:48.860 --> 05:49.520]  All right, here you go.
[05:49.540 --> 05:50.280]  He's so cute.
[05:50.700 --> 05:50.960]  Okay.
[05:52.260 --> 05:55.320]  So you didn't grade any of the cards from last week because we're waiting to do them all.
[05:56.020 --> 05:57.120]  I sent them off to get graded.
[05:57.320 --> 05:59.060]  No, no, no, the cards that we opened last week.
[05:59.060 --> 06:03.060]  Oh, yeah, I'm not going to grade any individual cards we opened until I get through the whole thing.
[06:03.060 --> 06:05.420]  All right, let's start with the pack sack, though.
[06:05.940 --> 06:07.140]  Tenderheart Bear is his name.
[06:07.400 --> 06:07.800]  Tenderheart Bear.
[06:08.760 --> 06:10.100]  We'll pull something out from the pack sack.
[06:10.200 --> 06:11.360]  Probably be something real good.
[06:11.520 --> 06:12.720]  We'll be real excited about it.
[06:13.520 --> 06:14.440]  It's going to be...
[06:14.440 --> 06:18.220]  Oh, NHL 1990 Pro Set Hockey.
[06:19.520 --> 06:24.280]  This is a good one for me because everybody knows I'm a huge hockey fan and I know lots about hockey players.
[06:24.380 --> 06:25.380]  I know how to say all their names.
[06:26.360 --> 06:26.660]  Yeah.
[06:28.220 --> 06:30.480]  Thomas Sandstrom said that one, right?
[06:30.800 --> 06:31.160]  Sandstorm.
[06:31.160 --> 06:33.180]  Brian Scrudland.
[06:33.400 --> 06:34.820]  Everybody remembers Brian Scrudland.
[06:35.100 --> 06:45.260]  He played alongside Craig Ludwig, a big enemy of Jeremy Renick, who once was friends with Mike Hough,
[06:45.960 --> 06:52.420]  who went to college with Luke Richardson, who played against Rick Zombo in his rookie year.
[06:52.420 --> 06:53.940]  Is that who pucked around with Rick?
[06:54.160 --> 06:57.320]  Yeah, Tommy Albelin stole his girlfriend.
[06:57.600 --> 06:58.060]  Oh, really?
[06:58.280 --> 06:59.740]  Randy Mauler was there.
[06:59.860 --> 07:00.640]  He DP'd there.
[07:00.640 --> 07:01.900]  He took...
[07:01.900 --> 07:01.960]  What?
[07:02.540 --> 07:04.240]  Yeah, pucking around is when they DP.
[07:04.400 --> 07:05.500]  They put the two Ps in the V.
[07:06.700 --> 07:07.960]  I was just talking about hockey.
[07:08.080 --> 07:09.300]  Yeah, I'm talking about hockey, too.
[07:09.480 --> 07:10.480]  I'm very...
[07:10.480 --> 07:10.700]  Tom Curvers.
[07:11.480 --> 07:11.760]  Perfect.
[07:11.900 --> 07:12.740]  Ron Tugnut.
[07:13.040 --> 07:13.600]  Oh, no!
[07:15.060 --> 07:16.280]  All right, well, let's say Ron Tugnut.
[07:16.280 --> 07:17.400]  He is the Tugnut.
[07:17.480 --> 07:18.640]  He's pucking around for sure.
[07:18.660 --> 07:19.740]  Alain Chevrier.
[07:19.980 --> 07:20.760]  He goes on Best Name.
[07:20.980 --> 07:23.040]  Do you guys remember the 1990 All-Star Game?
[07:24.080 --> 07:24.860]  Cam Neely does.
[07:25.880 --> 07:27.880]  I heard him say that it was the highlight of his career.
[07:29.460 --> 07:30.100]  Pierre Turgeon.
[07:31.760 --> 07:32.080]  Turgeon?
[07:32.460 --> 07:34.000]  Yeah, and then Uwe Krupp.
[07:34.080 --> 07:34.380]  Uwe!
[07:34.680 --> 07:36.460]  And then, of course, Don Maloney.
[07:36.660 --> 07:37.100]  So that was easy.
[07:37.340 --> 07:37.580]  Maloney.
[07:37.660 --> 07:38.760]  So that's from the pack sack.
[07:38.800 --> 07:40.160]  Let's open up some of the mail we got here.
[07:40.560 --> 07:41.880]  This is from...
[07:42.580 --> 07:43.940]  This has, I think, been here a little while.
[07:44.600 --> 07:46.380]  I found out that Eric has been hiding the mail.
[07:46.980 --> 07:47.660]  Where did he hide it?
[07:47.860 --> 07:49.520]  In a closet that I found.
[07:49.780 --> 07:51.000]  And so now I found out we have a lot of mail.
[07:51.240 --> 07:51.720]  Oh, really?
[07:53.960 --> 07:55.020]  He's a little spice ride.
[07:55.040 --> 07:55.620]  He hoards things.
[07:55.680 --> 07:56.260]  He does.
[07:58.200 --> 07:58.560]  See?
[07:58.960 --> 08:00.380]  Yeah, he's sneaky over there.
[08:00.460 --> 08:02.100]  But he's got shit inside of his tummy, too.
[08:02.260 --> 08:05.420]  What's going on with the chat today?
[08:05.800 --> 08:09.000]  Yeah, well, they say they found your eBay store.
[08:09.700 --> 08:10.880]  Someone did it in the comments.
[08:11.060 --> 08:12.000]  Someone said Jeremy Renner?
[08:12.780 --> 08:13.500]  Hey, guys.
[08:13.900 --> 08:15.780]  I wanted to give you guys some cards I thought were neat.
[08:15.920 --> 08:16.840]  Unfortunately, no Zim.
[08:17.080 --> 08:18.240]  That's totally understandable.
[08:18.360 --> 08:19.480]  I already gave Jim the Dunkin' Donuts.
[08:19.560 --> 08:20.120]  Thank you so much.
[08:20.560 --> 08:22.320]  I was playing this in the RTX 26 community.
[08:22.660 --> 08:24.080]  I wanted to send these as well.
[08:24.360 --> 08:25.040]  Oh, I don't want to...
[08:26.120 --> 08:27.660]  Okay, well, let's look at them first.
[08:27.660 --> 08:28.700]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:28.860 --> 08:29.460]  Check this out.
[08:29.880 --> 08:31.320]  He's got a little story behind each one.
[08:32.540 --> 08:35.280]  So, obviously, Alan gets her egg card.
[08:35.560 --> 08:36.060]  Oh, nice.
[08:36.060 --> 08:36.820]  That's a famous card.
[08:36.980 --> 08:37.660]  I love that one.
[08:38.180 --> 08:41.160]  I actually featured in an early episode of the Fuckface podcast.
[08:41.580 --> 08:43.520]  Gavin and everybody made fun of me because I bought an egg card.
[08:43.680 --> 08:44.240]  Now I got two.
[08:44.400 --> 08:45.280]  They got zero.
[08:45.740 --> 08:46.660]  Working on a dozen.
[08:46.760 --> 08:47.180]  Who won?
[08:47.300 --> 08:48.280]  I'm working on a dozen.
[08:48.560 --> 08:49.840]  Maybe I'll get a baker's dozen.
[08:50.940 --> 08:52.660]  Here we have Saw Gerrera.
[08:53.540 --> 08:54.020]  Oh, shit.
[08:54.020 --> 08:58.360]  Forrest Whitaker was his weird-voiced Star Wars character from Rogue One.
[08:58.680 --> 08:58.940]  Okay.
[08:59.360 --> 09:02.880]  Forrest Whitaker, I think, one of the greatest living actors living.
[09:04.100 --> 09:04.540]  Okay.
[09:04.700 --> 09:04.840]  Today.
[09:04.920 --> 09:05.540]  More than...
[09:05.540 --> 09:05.720]  Still alive.
[09:05.940 --> 09:07.760]  Love him to death, but I don't understand that voice.
[09:08.360 --> 09:08.840]  His voice?
[09:08.940 --> 09:09.980]  What's his voice like?
[09:09.980 --> 09:10.600]  The voice in the movie.
[09:11.260 --> 09:12.920]  He talk like this.
[09:12.980 --> 09:13.480]  Nuh-uh.
[09:13.720 --> 09:14.760]  He talk like this.
[09:15.320 --> 09:16.040]  Yeah, that was weird.
[09:16.200 --> 09:18.300]  Like, he only spoke on the inhale?
[09:18.480 --> 09:21.460]  Yeah, he had, like, a throat problem or something that made him sound like an idiot.
[09:21.600 --> 09:22.640]  In the movie, yeah.
[09:22.640 --> 09:23.760]  Here we have Darth Vader.
[09:24.160 --> 09:24.760]  How do you talk?
[09:24.900 --> 09:25.840]  You might remember him from Star Wars.
[09:31.580 --> 09:32.380]  That's him again.
[09:33.560 --> 09:34.320]  More Darth Vader.
[09:34.960 --> 09:35.480]  And then...
[09:35.480 --> 09:43.100]  Oh, and then we have Vitaly Potapenko, who was a Celtic in 2000.
[09:43.660 --> 09:44.840]  Let's see what...
[09:44.840 --> 09:45.620]  That's a cool card.
[09:46.000 --> 09:46.900]  A Dunkin' Donuts card.
[09:47.140 --> 09:51.960]  I wanted to send these as well as the Dunkin' Donuts Vitaly Potapenko, a.k.a. the Ukraine Train.
[09:52.160 --> 09:52.580]  Oh, my God.
[09:52.580 --> 09:55.460]  It's a Celtics card for Geoff's collection if you didn't already have it.
[09:55.480 --> 09:56.140]  I did not have it.
[09:56.200 --> 10:01.300]  Actually, the Celtics from about 95 to 2008 or so...
[10:01.300 --> 10:03.660]  2007 is a black spot for me.
[10:03.820 --> 10:04.600]  Like a blank spot.
[10:04.700 --> 10:05.200]  I didn't watch...
[10:05.200 --> 10:06.020]  I didn't follow any sports.
[10:06.220 --> 10:06.300]  Yeah.
[10:07.240 --> 10:09.160]  And so I missed a lot of that era.
[10:10.900 --> 10:12.000]  That is so cool.
[10:12.520 --> 10:13.240]  Since you don't have it.
[10:13.260 --> 10:14.540]  I know it's not the world's largest aircraft.
[10:14.960 --> 10:16.540]  Boy, I bet he sent this a while ago.
[10:16.900 --> 10:18.600]  The world's largest aircraft is one of those...
[10:19.400 --> 10:21.820]  Allen and Ginter cards I tried to get, like, in year one.
[10:22.580 --> 10:26.140]  Also included is 2019 Allen and Ginter Egg, which apparently saw a similar trajectory in 2021.
[10:26.580 --> 10:29.040]  And the Break Shit episode is something I really enjoy.
[10:29.120 --> 10:29.720]  I've gotten me through it.
[10:30.120 --> 10:30.620]  Thank you.
[10:30.660 --> 10:31.800]  Thank you so much, Michael.
[10:31.880 --> 10:32.560]  That's very nice of you.
[10:32.620 --> 10:33.160]  And he's from Austin.
[10:33.420 --> 10:34.000]  Oh, nice.
[10:34.160 --> 10:34.760]  He's a local fella.
[10:35.020 --> 10:38.600]  Do you have any other, like, Celtics and Dunkin' Donuts collab cards?
[10:39.160 --> 10:39.920]  No, I don't think so.
[10:39.920 --> 10:40.360]  That's pretty epic.
[10:40.580 --> 10:41.960]  Dunkin' is so Boston.
[10:42.420 --> 10:42.720]  Yeah.
[10:42.860 --> 10:43.860]  It doesn't get more Boston than Dunkin'.
[10:43.860 --> 10:44.280]  Dunkies.
[10:45.820 --> 10:47.660]  I'm sorry it took us so long to find and open that.
[10:47.660 --> 10:48.520]  But those are really wonderful.
[10:49.380 --> 10:50.060]  Okay, let's see.
[10:50.120 --> 10:51.120]  Oh, was there no note?
[10:52.760 --> 10:53.140]  No.
[10:53.360 --> 10:54.830]  I think there might be notes on the...
[10:55.380 --> 10:56.100]  All right, here we go.
[10:57.140 --> 10:59.900]  Oh, this guy's got, like, notes for...
[10:59.900 --> 11:00.200]  Cute.
[11:00.360 --> 11:04.640]  This guy isn't a padre, but he did get caught jerking it in a parking lot in his car.
[11:04.760 --> 11:06.400]  I figured it was worth a piece of...
[11:06.400 --> 11:06.880]  Hell yeah.
[11:07.200 --> 11:07.580]  ...history.
[11:08.380 --> 11:08.760]  Yeah.
[11:09.180 --> 11:09.560]  Nice.
[11:09.620 --> 11:10.700]  Let's take a look at who we have here.
[11:10.960 --> 11:13.780]  Ooh, an autograph of...
[11:14.800 --> 11:15.560]  Reese McGuire.
[11:15.840 --> 11:16.880]  Reese McGuire.
[11:17.660 --> 11:19.080]  Have you ever jerked it in a parking lot?
[11:19.360 --> 11:20.600]  Me? Not in a parking lot, no.
[11:20.800 --> 11:20.980]  Yeah.
[11:21.400 --> 11:21.920]  Have you?
[11:24.000 --> 11:24.780]  Yeah, you have.
[11:25.820 --> 11:26.780]  I don't think so.
[11:27.820 --> 11:30.080]  You know, I can't remember, but I...
[11:30.080 --> 11:31.100]  Seems like I would've.
[11:31.380 --> 11:33.480]  Do you think it would've, like, you jerking yourself?
[11:34.160 --> 11:35.600]  I jerked it in a...
[11:35.600 --> 11:37.560]  At a gas station bathroom once in high school.
[11:38.220 --> 11:39.640]  Because you were just...
[11:39.640 --> 11:41.040]  Because you were like, I just have to do it now.
[11:41.040 --> 11:45.920]  I've told this story before, but I saw a woman who was so beautiful driving in front of me,
[11:45.920 --> 11:49.720]  I had to pull over and immediately go to the bathroom in, like, a Chevron.
[11:49.860 --> 11:51.140]  Were you on a family vacation?
[11:51.360 --> 11:54.700]  No, I was like 17, and I was, like, driving to work or something, and I was like...
[11:55.400 --> 11:58.060]  Uh, I didn't know what to do with myself, and I, like, pulled over, and I just...
[11:59.700 --> 12:00.420]  Oh, God.
[12:01.040 --> 12:01.960]  It's not easy.
[12:01.980 --> 12:02.080]  Sick.
[12:02.080 --> 12:03.600]  It's not easy being a teenage boy.
[12:03.800 --> 12:05.100]  I just... Ugh.
[12:05.240 --> 12:05.820]  What do we got here?
[12:05.860 --> 12:08.880]  We got Mackenzie Gore, Bowman Silver.
[12:09.280 --> 12:12.360]  We got a Hunter Renfro relic card.
[12:12.520 --> 12:13.300]  That's lovely.
[12:14.500 --> 12:17.240]  Andres Munoz, Foil Refractor.
[12:17.480 --> 12:18.840]  Manny Machado.
[12:19.220 --> 12:20.520]  So these are all Padres, obviously.
[12:20.840 --> 12:21.500]  Taylor Trammell.
[12:22.240 --> 12:23.540]  Oh, we got Eric Lauer here.
[12:23.740 --> 12:25.300]  It's Dodgers, because I like the Dodgers.
[12:25.520 --> 12:25.720]  Yeah.
[12:25.920 --> 12:26.920]  Luis Grias.
[12:27.640 --> 12:28.600]  Josh Naylor.
[12:29.180 --> 12:29.840]  Ooh, Pedro.
[12:30.120 --> 12:31.580]  This is for the Don Pedro project.
[12:31.580 --> 12:32.240]  He's a rookie.
[12:32.660 --> 12:33.460]  That's gorgeous.
[12:33.720 --> 12:34.440]  He's little.
[12:34.700 --> 12:34.760]  Yeah.
[12:35.160 --> 12:36.180]  He's a skinny little dude.
[12:36.500 --> 12:37.160]  Will Myers.
[12:37.560 --> 12:37.920]  Nice.
[12:38.460 --> 12:39.300]  That is a...
[12:39.300 --> 12:40.480]  That is a...
[12:41.180 --> 12:43.000]  I believe that's a parallel.
[12:43.600 --> 12:45.460]  Oh yeah, it's numbered to 2019.
[12:46.820 --> 12:48.280]  So this is a 2019 card.
[12:48.320 --> 12:50.200]  I talked about this last week in the 2024s.
[12:50.300 --> 12:53.540]  They have, every year, they have a series of parallels
[12:53.540 --> 12:55.380]  that is numbered to the year it is.
[12:55.440 --> 12:58.280]  So this is 2019, so it's number 207 of 2019.
[12:58.460 --> 12:58.900]  That's awesome.
[12:59.120 --> 13:01.520]  And then these are numbered to 2024.
[13:01.900 --> 13:02.260]  Oh.
[13:02.340 --> 13:02.460]  That's cool.
[13:03.400 --> 13:04.740]  We don't have one yet though, right?
[13:04.780 --> 13:05.420]  Travis Jankowski.
[13:05.480 --> 13:06.220]  We got one last week.
[13:06.360 --> 13:06.480]  Oh.
[13:06.880 --> 13:07.640]  I'll point it out again.
[13:07.700 --> 13:08.840]  We'll get more today, I'm sure.
[13:08.940 --> 13:10.120]  Was it when I wasn't paying attention?
[13:11.020 --> 13:11.380]  What?
[13:13.160 --> 13:14.600]  This guy's in lots of stuff.
[13:15.380 --> 13:16.260]  Manny Margo.
[13:16.480 --> 13:17.380]  There's more Padres stuff.
[13:17.520 --> 13:19.000]  So it could be all Padres and Dodgers.
[13:19.020 --> 13:20.400]  Good thing Eric's here to enjoy this.
[13:20.700 --> 13:21.780]  Fernando Tatis Jr.
[13:21.960 --> 13:22.840]  I really wanted to...
[13:22.840 --> 13:27.340]  Hey man, I want to take the time today with you here
[13:27.340 --> 13:29.980]  just to sit and we'll go through the Padres.
[13:30.120 --> 13:31.020]  We'll enjoy them together.
[13:31.720 --> 13:34.680]  We'll revel in the Padres, Padre fandom.
[13:35.120 --> 13:38.580]  After the show last week, Eric pulled us aside
[13:38.580 --> 13:41.000]  and was like, hey, everything I said about the Dodgers
[13:41.000 --> 13:41.780]  I didn't mean.
[13:42.080 --> 13:43.600]  If anything, he meant the opposite.
[13:43.920 --> 13:45.900]  He said, I actually hate Hitler.
[13:46.420 --> 13:47.360]  And I like the Dodgers.
[13:47.440 --> 13:47.680]  Right.
[13:47.780 --> 13:48.120]  That's what he said.
[13:48.600 --> 13:49.880]  Manny Machado again.
[13:49.900 --> 13:51.860]  He usually bets on the Dodgers to win.
[13:52.120 --> 13:52.880]  Well, that's what he says.
[13:52.940 --> 13:54.800]  He says he's like, when he bets with his heart,
[13:54.980 --> 13:57.880]  he bets on the Padres, but when he bets with his wallet,
[13:58.080 --> 13:59.020]  he bets on the Dodgers.
[13:59.080 --> 14:00.420]  Because that's what he really cares about
[14:00.420 --> 14:01.480]  and who he really loves.
[14:01.880 --> 14:02.420]  His wallet?
[14:02.760 --> 14:03.300]  The Dodgers.
[14:03.500 --> 14:03.920]  The Dodgers.
[14:04.200 --> 14:05.740]  He just knows a good deal.
[14:06.160 --> 14:07.740]  2019, Fernando Tatis.
[14:08.140 --> 14:08.580]  Rookie?
[14:08.720 --> 14:09.320]  Holy shit.
[14:09.320 --> 14:10.400]  That's a base rookie.
[14:11.920 --> 14:12.560]  But that...
[14:13.760 --> 14:14.080]  That's...
[14:14.080 --> 14:14.800]  Thank you.
[14:15.040 --> 14:15.720]  That's a nice card.
[14:16.260 --> 14:17.200]  I'll have to look that up.
[14:17.300 --> 14:18.460]  That might be worth a little bit of money.
[14:20.080 --> 14:21.600]  I'm checking the live chat.
[14:22.180 --> 14:23.540]  The whole peanut, too?
[14:23.780 --> 14:27.060]  Jerked off on the highway in the backseat of a Humvee in Iraq.
[14:28.100 --> 14:29.280]  Thank you for your service.
[14:29.860 --> 14:30.580]  Wallet was moving?
[14:31.480 --> 14:32.920]  Yeah, that's how he got the vibration.
[14:33.060 --> 14:33.660]  He didn't even have to move.
[14:33.740 --> 14:34.440]  He's like...
[14:34.880 --> 14:35.960]  Dude, you hit some of those...
[14:35.960 --> 14:37.620]  You hit some of those wadis in the desert.
[14:37.720 --> 14:38.480]  I could see that happening.
[14:38.480 --> 14:39.400]  Wadi? What's that?
[14:39.440 --> 14:40.180]  It's like when the...
[14:40.180 --> 14:40.440]  Oh.
[14:40.620 --> 14:41.560]  When the ground goes like that.
[14:42.280 --> 14:44.780]  They call them wadis in motorcycle racing.
[14:44.800 --> 14:45.800]  You should think of them like wavies.
[14:46.600 --> 14:47.260]  They should, right?
[14:47.560 --> 14:48.000]  Here we go.
[14:48.080 --> 14:48.480]  We got some...
[14:48.480 --> 14:50.000]  Here's some Christmas parallels.
[14:50.140 --> 14:51.620]  These are both SPs, I believe.
[14:51.700 --> 14:52.680]  You can see the thing in the background.
[14:54.640 --> 14:55.900]  Cronenworth and Cam.
[14:55.940 --> 14:57.020]  These are great Padres.
[14:57.180 --> 14:58.080]  Everybody loves the Padres.
[14:58.260 --> 15:00.360]  We're a big Padres podcast here.
[15:00.440 --> 15:01.660]  Not as much as Dodgers.
[15:01.800 --> 15:02.300]  Everybody knows that.
[15:02.360 --> 15:03.580]  Padres are our second favorite team.
[15:03.840 --> 15:06.940]  That's why we're going through and we're showing off all this great Padre love.
[15:07.000 --> 15:07.700]  Fernando Tatis.
[15:07.700 --> 15:08.640]  Here's his shoes.
[15:08.980 --> 15:13.560]  If you ever wanted to jack off on shoes, there's a pair for you.
[15:13.940 --> 15:14.980]  A lot of people do that.
[15:15.180 --> 15:19.120]  Baseball hasn't really gotten into the shoe game like the way that the NBA has.
[15:19.280 --> 15:20.140]  Yeah, they don't...
[15:20.140 --> 15:22.240]  Cleats aren't as universal as basketball shoes.
[15:22.440 --> 15:23.020]  Do they do...
[15:23.020 --> 15:25.500]  They click too loud when you wear them around the mold.
[15:26.040 --> 15:27.040]  Like little tap shoes?
[15:27.200 --> 15:29.100]  Yeah, and everybody's like, hey, look at that guy tapping.
[15:29.460 --> 15:29.720]  Right.
[15:30.220 --> 15:30.540]  But...
[15:30.540 --> 15:32.640]  No, I've got a third base.
[15:32.760 --> 15:33.720]  But, like, they haven't done...
[15:34.360 --> 15:36.140]  Maybe they do within their own, like, thing.
[15:36.140 --> 15:37.980]  But, like, do people wear, like, brightly colored ones?
[15:38.040 --> 15:38.860]  I haven't seen...
[15:38.860 --> 15:39.260]  Shoes?
[15:39.620 --> 15:39.780]  Yeah.
[15:39.860 --> 15:40.440]  Like in baseball.
[15:40.800 --> 15:41.300]  Yeah, yeah, they do.
[15:41.380 --> 15:43.280]  I guess I've just never noticed their style.
[15:43.360 --> 15:46.020]  Here's a Cronenworth 35th anniversary silver-chrome rookie.
[15:46.100 --> 15:46.700]  That's lovely.
[15:47.380 --> 15:50.180]  Here's a Fernando Tatis top stadium club.
[15:51.440 --> 15:51.780]  That...
[15:52.340 --> 15:53.480]  That's not an SP, is it?
[15:53.480 --> 15:53.880]  It might be.
[15:53.940 --> 15:55.180]  I'll have to look in that, see if it's an image variation.
[15:56.200 --> 15:58.200]  Here's a Tatis again, rookie cup.
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.560]  Tatis stars of the MLB.
[16:00.740 --> 16:01.760]  Chris Paddock again.
[16:01.760 --> 16:06.040]  Here's a Fernando Tatis Revolution base card, it looks like.
[16:06.540 --> 16:10.180]  And then a Tatis 87 tops 35th anniversary throwback.
[16:10.300 --> 16:11.220]  That's a gorgeous card.
[16:11.640 --> 16:12.320]  God ble...
[16:12.320 --> 16:13.060]  I just...
[16:13.060 --> 16:15.480]  I'm glad we got to spend a little bit of time talking about the Padres.
[16:15.700 --> 16:17.460]  I wore my Padres brown shirt for it.
[16:17.460 --> 16:17.640]  Yeah.
[16:17.740 --> 16:18.220]  Just to be safe.
[16:18.340 --> 16:19.740]  Yeah, just in case we were gonna...
[16:19.740 --> 16:22.500]  He has his Padres brown and Dodger blue.
[16:22.720 --> 16:25.500]  Yeah, he's wearing Padres brown and Dodger blue because he's a divided fan.
[16:26.540 --> 16:26.940]  He...
[16:26.940 --> 16:30.740]  Anyway, I feel like we've given the Padres the reverence and the attention they deserve.
[16:30.740 --> 16:32.200]  So let's never speak of them again.
[16:32.260 --> 16:33.040]  No, of course not.
[16:33.060 --> 16:33.840]  But we can only...
[16:33.840 --> 16:34.420]  Is that okay with you, Eric?
[16:37.240 --> 16:37.600]  Okay.
[16:37.900 --> 16:38.100]  Yeah.
[16:38.180 --> 16:38.580]  Sounds good.
[16:38.880 --> 16:39.420]  Sounds good.
[16:39.960 --> 16:46.680]  Someone in the chat earlier also wanted to know your thoughts on last night's Celtics and Golden State Warriors game.
[16:47.200 --> 16:48.160]  What'd you think about that?
[16:48.220 --> 16:48.820]  Did you have a good time?
[16:49.960 --> 16:51.740]  I heard Steph Curry said...
[16:53.060 --> 16:55.800]  He said in a post-game press conference, he said...
[16:55.800 --> 16:57.700]  It's kind of felt like what we used to do to teams.
[16:57.700 --> 17:01.760]  People are saying that's kind of a passing of the torch moment.
[17:02.000 --> 17:02.300]  Wow.
[17:02.480 --> 17:03.220]  And I'll take it as that.
[17:03.340 --> 17:04.880]  We beat the dog shit out of them.
[17:04.980 --> 17:06.400]  We beat them by 52 points.
[17:06.560 --> 17:10.460]  We pulled our starters three minutes into the third quarter, I want to say.
[17:10.720 --> 17:11.960]  Or with about nine minutes.
[17:12.180 --> 17:13.060]  Maybe nine minutes into the third quarter.
[17:13.060 --> 17:14.900]  It was like 80 to 20 at one point, it felt like.
[17:15.100 --> 17:20.760]  We were up by 60 at some point and it was only 52 because we let off the gas in the last three minutes.
[17:20.960 --> 17:21.100]  Mercy.
[17:21.420 --> 17:23.000]  It was a thing of beauty.
[17:23.400 --> 17:26.320]  Nobody wants to see a blowout unless it's your team doing the blowout.
[17:26.320 --> 17:29.020]  It was my team, so I wanted to see the blowout.
[17:29.880 --> 17:33.000]  Third 50-point victory by the Celtics this year.
[17:33.120 --> 17:35.880]  First time in the history of the NBA that's ever been done before.
[17:39.640 --> 17:40.440]  Go Celtics!
[17:40.600 --> 17:42.140]  We're going to be raising banner 18 up.
[17:42.460 --> 17:43.060]  I hope so.
[17:43.160 --> 17:45.100]  All the way to the top of the garden.
[17:45.320 --> 17:50.840]  Do you feel the difference is like age, things clicking, or new players coming in?
[17:51.440 --> 17:52.160]  All of the above.
[17:52.180 --> 17:52.900]  All of the above.
[17:53.040 --> 17:55.780]  I think the biggest thing we have going for us this year...
[17:55.780 --> 17:58.480]  Obviously Kristaps Porzingis has been a huge upgrade for us.
[17:59.620 --> 18:05.380]  And Derek White has continued to evolve into really an all-star caliber player.
[18:05.700 --> 18:11.280]  And then, of course, Drew Holliday has very capably fit into Marcus Slot's role.
[18:11.720 --> 18:12.660]  It's not the same.
[18:12.880 --> 18:13.560]  No, of course not.
[18:13.960 --> 18:19.480]  But Jalen Brown has picked up a lot of the heart and a lot of the toughness that we lost in Marcus Smart.
[18:19.480 --> 18:28.440]  But I think a real big thing is that Joe Mazzullo got a lot of shit last year for being a rookie coach.
[18:28.880 --> 18:34.680]  But nobody wants to remember the reality is he got thrown in at the last second.
[18:35.140 --> 18:36.860]  They didn't have a full training schedule.
[18:37.060 --> 18:39.360]  He lost half of the assistant coaches.
[18:39.540 --> 18:42.740]  He was playing with a less than full coaching staff almost all year.
[18:42.800 --> 18:47.960]  This is the first year that he's been able to plan and implement a plan as a full-time head coach.
[18:47.960 --> 18:49.400]  And this is what we're seeing.
[18:49.720 --> 18:52.700]  And so, sure, Tatum's just hit 26 yesterday.
[18:53.840 --> 18:55.560]  Everybody's ascending into their primes.
[18:55.960 --> 19:00.780]  And we have a better, more solid team with, I think, a stronger bench.
[19:00.920 --> 19:05.920]  But I think a lot of it is just that we are not beset with controversy at the beginning of the year.
[19:06.120 --> 19:10.720]  And we have the time and effort to play and train and practice like we're supposed to.
[19:10.980 --> 19:12.100]  That was a long answer.
[19:12.400 --> 19:13.260]  I loved it though.
[19:13.660 --> 19:14.640]  Let's open up some cards.
[19:16.520 --> 19:21.140]  Whenever you guys do Raise Banner 18, you can do a So I'll Ride about this season.
[19:21.660 --> 19:22.860]  Hell yeah, I will.
[19:23.480 --> 19:25.640]  So where are we in the...
[19:26.740 --> 19:27.940]  What is this one called again?
[19:28.100 --> 19:32.720]  I think this is called a retail box.
[19:33.200 --> 19:36.700]  There's a mega box, a monster box, and then a retail box.
[19:36.820 --> 19:38.360]  And they're all kind of the same thing.
[19:38.920 --> 19:40.500]  They're all, to my knowledge, retail.
[19:40.680 --> 19:43.360]  Although this one says look for autograph and relic cards.
[19:44.200 --> 19:45.740]  In theory, I bought most of these online.
[19:46.300 --> 19:49.460]  Right, but there's certain ones that we can only get at the hobby shop.
[19:49.560 --> 19:50.660]  But we're still in the retail target.
[19:50.660 --> 19:52.660]  Yeah, these are retail, so you should be able to get these.
[19:52.740 --> 19:53.540]  These for sure.
[19:55.840 --> 19:58.460]  Actually, I think this might be the monster box.
[19:58.580 --> 20:01.780]  Look for foil board cards because I don't see...
[20:01.780 --> 20:02.380]  It doesn't look like...
[20:02.380 --> 20:04.480]  This is what a retail box typically looks like.
[20:04.600 --> 20:06.100]  So we're just going to burn through these.
[20:06.220 --> 20:07.340]  I'm not going to...
[20:07.340 --> 20:12.600]  I'll just point out anything funny or interesting and then we'll look for parallels or inserts.
[20:12.600 --> 20:17.100]  And of course, I'm happy to answer questions if you want to run the chat.
[20:17.120 --> 20:19.740]  Yeah, if anybody wants to ask questions in the live chat, we can.
[20:19.840 --> 20:26.080]  Since Eric is being so un-Eric today and being respectful and quiet, we'll maybe talk to the chat a little bit.
[20:26.540 --> 20:29.620]  Alright, Alex Braddon, Paul Goldschmidt, Coco Monti's rookie. That's cool.
[20:30.960 --> 20:32.520]  Christian Bethencourt, Brendan White.
[20:32.580 --> 20:38.060]  I just found out, Alec Thomas, about two more SPs that hit that you got to watch out for.
[20:38.060 --> 20:44.160]  We talked last week about how you can get the one-of-ones in the back for the first print that aren't properly...
[20:46.520 --> 20:46.880]  Marked?
[20:46.880 --> 20:51.060]  Marked. But I don't know if I mentioned the Kevin Hart parallels.
[20:51.600 --> 20:51.760]  Oh!
[20:51.840 --> 20:52.440]  Did I talk about those?
[20:52.460 --> 20:52.980]  I don't think you have.
[20:53.240 --> 20:56.240]  For every Phillies player, every Phillies card, they put in...
[20:56.240 --> 21:03.200]  I think they're numbered to like 50 or 60, but they have photoshopped tiny pictures of Kevin Hart into all the Phillies cards.
[21:03.220 --> 21:04.540]  I love that. I have to get one of those.
[21:04.540 --> 21:05.780]  You got to look out for those.
[21:05.840 --> 21:08.540]  And then I read today that they put a bunch of...
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.760]  I don't remember who it was, but it was a Shohei and then one other player.
[21:15.280 --> 21:19.620]  But they put a Shohei in a Dodgers uniform as an SP, and they just didn't announce it.
[21:19.740 --> 21:22.620]  And so nobody knows how rare they are, but they're going for like $1,300 to $1,700.
[21:22.920 --> 21:24.180]  Oh shit, the secret Shohei.
[21:24.200 --> 21:27.820]  So if you get a Shohei, make sure it's in the Dodgers uniform, we know.
[21:27.920 --> 21:30.120]  Alright, Grand Gamers, Derek Jeter.
[21:30.440 --> 21:33.280]  So they've done a lot of real low-key, wacky stuff this year.
[21:33.280 --> 21:34.560]  Vladimir Guerrero Jr.
[21:34.980 --> 21:40.580]  Someone in the chat asked, when was the last time I went to a Dolly Parton stampede, formerly the Dixie Stampede?
[21:40.620 --> 21:45.200]  Which I have not been to because that's at Dollywood, which I have not been to yet.
[21:45.340 --> 21:50.380]  But I am working on convincing Geoff to go to Silver Dollar City with me.
[21:52.420 --> 21:54.340]  Isn't it like Disneyland, but God?
[21:54.680 --> 21:58.080]  No, it's not God, it's like Hillbilly Ozark themed Disneyland.
[21:58.080 --> 22:01.660]  Where it's more like, just hillbilly stuff.
[22:01.720 --> 22:08.140]  A lot of like banjos and smells like kettle corn and kind of stuff like that.
[22:08.160 --> 22:10.320]  Michael Harris relic here with the fucking...
[22:10.320 --> 22:13.180]  But there's a lot of God. A lot of God.
[22:13.420 --> 22:21.940]  But you just look past it. You just look past all like the, you know, large families and like where there's like a lot of kids and denim skirts and long hair and stuff.
[22:22.860 --> 22:24.320]  Here we go. Here's Harold Ramirez.
[22:24.320 --> 22:25.520]  This is that parallel I was talking about.
[22:25.620 --> 22:31.100]  I don't know if it's considered like brown or bronze or whatever, but if you roll over on the back, this is number 1893 out of 2024.
[22:31.500 --> 22:33.040]  Because this is a 2024 card.
[22:33.340 --> 22:33.500]  Wow.
[22:34.600 --> 22:36.400]  Put that out there. Greg Maddox.
[22:36.700 --> 22:38.480]  Yeah, when I think of him, I think of him as a cub.
[22:38.640 --> 22:40.180]  But here we are, Greg Maddox is a bird.
[22:40.200 --> 22:43.800]  I still don't fully understand that joke because...
[22:43.800 --> 22:45.200]  Jason Dominguez bass, that's nice.
[22:45.400 --> 22:48.780]  Would it be like seeing Marcus Smart not in a Celtics uniform?
[22:49.320 --> 22:54.600]  He's a famous brave pitcher, but he started as a cub and then he played for the Cubs again later in his career.
[22:54.840 --> 22:58.720]  Because I was alive then and watching baseball, I remember him coming into the league as a cub.
[22:59.300 --> 23:02.620]  Eric is just really into the idea that he was a brave.
[23:02.760 --> 23:07.800]  It's neat how this one that has the fabric has like a little bit of... I know that's probably not good, but it's neat.
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.040]  Oh, yeah, that's got a little like a...
[23:10.040 --> 23:10.220]  Thread.
[23:10.480 --> 23:10.960]  Thread hanging.
[23:12.220 --> 23:17.040]  Clay Holmes, Reg, Jalen Duren, Hunter Green. What's going on in the chat? Andy Ibanez.
[23:17.040 --> 23:21.880]  Any thoughts on OKC, SGA, and Chet can go far.
[23:22.540 --> 23:23.140]  I'm sorry, what?
[23:23.360 --> 23:24.480]  I don't know what a lot of those words are.
[23:24.600 --> 23:25.240]  Any thoughts on what?
[23:26.180 --> 23:30.440]  On OKC, SGA plus Chet can go far.
[23:30.680 --> 23:33.280]  SGA is Shea Gilgis Alexander, Chet is Chet Holmgren.
[23:33.980 --> 23:42.060]  Yeah, I think that the Oklahoma City Thunder are two years away from being the best team in basketball for about four years straight.
[23:42.600 --> 23:44.500]  They're phenomenal and they're gonna be phenomenal.
[23:44.500 --> 23:46.460]  This is a foil card.
[23:46.540 --> 23:47.020]  So there you go.
[23:47.440 --> 23:49.600]  And then here we have a Jose Altuve 2023 insert.
[23:50.340 --> 23:53.520]  Why did you pick White Sox over the Cubs when you were picking a team?
[23:53.940 --> 23:55.520]  I liked both when I was a kid.
[23:55.660 --> 24:01.740]  I actually liked three teams like the Braves, the Cubs and the White Sox just because they were what was on WGN and WTBS.
[24:02.100 --> 24:13.200]  I picked the White Sox overall because while I really liked Ryan Sandberg and Mark Grace on the Cubs, I really, really, really liked Frank Thomas.
[24:13.360 --> 24:13.580]  Yeah.
[24:14.240 --> 24:15.040]  What's his deal?
[24:15.260 --> 24:15.860]  He's the big hurt.
[24:16.220 --> 24:17.020]  He was a cleanup hitter.
[24:17.100 --> 24:17.500]  He's a strong dude.
[24:17.560 --> 24:19.200]  He's the guy that sells dick pills on TV now.
[24:19.500 --> 24:19.780]  What?
[24:20.200 --> 24:22.040]  And ladies, she'll love it too.
[24:22.200 --> 24:22.540]  That guy.
[24:22.680 --> 24:23.620]  Oh, you'll have to play.
[24:23.800 --> 24:25.720]  I've never seen the commercial, but you'll have to play it for mine.
[24:25.860 --> 24:26.560]  He's just a great player.
[24:26.640 --> 24:28.380]  And I also had a dude named Robin Ventura I really liked.
[24:28.400 --> 24:30.040]  And I really liked Ozzy Guillen as a player.
[24:30.240 --> 24:31.140]  And then I liked him as a manager.
[24:31.280 --> 24:34.460]  And then I didn't like him as much when he got fired for some of the shit he said.
[24:35.580 --> 24:37.960]  Someone said thoughts on the White Sox leaving Chicago.
[24:38.260 --> 24:38.580]  I assume...
[24:39.100 --> 24:39.840]  I don't think it's gonna happen.
[24:40.120 --> 24:41.420]  So here's a Phillies card, Brandon Marsh.
[24:41.420 --> 24:45.100]  I don't see a Kevin Hart on there.
[24:45.520 --> 24:47.700]  Someone asked what should my next tattoo be?
[24:47.940 --> 24:49.340]  We got tattoos this weekend.
[24:49.420 --> 24:49.780]  We did.
[24:50.080 --> 24:51.860]  We got touch-ups and a little new piece.
[24:52.060 --> 24:55.920]  I got what's called a get what you get tattoo just for fun.
[24:56.020 --> 24:56.540]  Oh, yeah.
[24:56.800 --> 24:58.500]  And I ended up getting a snake tattoo.
[24:59.900 --> 25:01.140]  I don't like snakes.
[25:01.260 --> 25:04.200]  At an Austin tattoo company where we really like to go get tattoos,
[25:04.560 --> 25:09.140]  they have a vending machine where it's 60 bucks and it's just a little piece of flash.
[25:09.600 --> 25:10.820]  And yeah, get what you get.
[25:10.820 --> 25:14.000]  And it was a snake, but it's a heart with a dagger through it.
[25:14.080 --> 25:15.120]  So it's a dead snake.
[25:15.500 --> 25:17.420]  And it's on the back of your leg, so only I look at it.
[25:17.500 --> 25:17.720]  Yeah.
[25:17.900 --> 25:20.300]  Joey Votto, Zach Wheeler, Brian...
[25:20.680 --> 25:23.420]  So I think that your next tattoo should be something out of a vending machine.
[25:23.520 --> 25:24.000]  Get what you get.
[25:24.620 --> 25:28.660]  Zach Gelof, Blue Rookie Parallel.
[25:28.720 --> 25:29.220]  That's nice.
[25:29.360 --> 25:30.120]  I'll just leave that.
[25:32.300 --> 25:33.020]  Tyler Soderstrom.
[25:34.060 --> 25:35.520]  Soderstrom, but Soderstrom.
[25:37.640 --> 25:39.580]  Christian Encarnacion Strand, Rookie.
[25:39.860 --> 25:41.220]  Dean Demeter, Wilmer Flores.
[25:41.500 --> 25:44.240]  Someone recommended that if we want to get into hockey,
[25:44.340 --> 25:47.560]  we should pay attention to the Detroit Red Wings, which we are.
[25:47.820 --> 25:49.820]  Going to a Red Wings game in like a month, actually.
[25:50.020 --> 25:51.040]  My first NHL game.
[25:51.180 --> 25:51.900]  Yes, we're excited.
[25:51.980 --> 25:58.380]  My dad has been really focused on making sure that he takes Geoff to his first NHL game.
[25:58.900 --> 25:59.920]  And he's been...
[25:59.920 --> 26:01.740]  We grew up with the hockey on TV all the time.
[26:01.820 --> 26:02.580]  That was the sport.
[26:02.600 --> 26:04.240]  Yeah, you grew up a Kings fan, right?
[26:04.240 --> 26:05.360]  Gretzky, yeah.
[26:06.880 --> 26:07.620]  Oh, shit.
[26:07.740 --> 26:08.120]  That's cool.
[26:08.340 --> 26:12.660]  Aaron Judge, whatever that refractor parallel is called.
[26:12.740 --> 26:13.060]  That's cool.
[26:13.560 --> 26:14.460]  Shimmer kind of thing.
[26:14.600 --> 26:14.880]  That's nice.
[26:14.940 --> 26:15.300]  That's pretty.
[26:15.780 --> 26:16.640]  Another Aaron Judge.
[26:17.800 --> 26:19.060]  He had a good year last year, I heard.
[26:19.520 --> 26:23.000]  Emmett Sheehan, Michael Kopach, J.J. Bladet.
[26:28.180 --> 26:28.620]  What...
[26:28.620 --> 26:30.300]  Are the Tigers going to be good this year?
[26:30.960 --> 26:32.560]  They're good in spring training.
[26:32.700 --> 26:33.160]  That's good.
[26:33.160 --> 26:36.000]  Maybe this is just the year for Detroit to come back.
[26:36.080 --> 26:36.580]  I love it.
[26:36.920 --> 26:38.840]  Andrew Montesterio, Kiebert Ruiz.
[26:38.920 --> 26:40.440]  This is the first year I'm going to follow the Pirates.
[26:41.020 --> 26:42.680]  Or, I'm sorry, I'm holding a Pirates card.
[26:43.960 --> 26:44.760]  Olika Williams, Ricky.
[26:45.720 --> 26:46.180]  Sean Ruiz.
[26:46.240 --> 26:47.480]  It's the first year I'm going to follow the Tigers.
[26:47.640 --> 26:49.040]  I am going to do my best to follow them.
[26:49.120 --> 26:50.060]  There's Corbin Carroll, Ricky Kopp.
[26:50.880 --> 26:53.040]  And Burn Dog is going to be doing it with me.
[26:53.140 --> 26:53.720]  Saad Taylor.
[26:53.900 --> 26:55.160]  We're going to try to be Tigers fans.
[26:55.300 --> 26:57.360]  Bernie Batdog is ready to get into sports.
[26:57.780 --> 27:00.820]  And last night you were explaining a lot of sports to him, which was good.
[27:01.060 --> 27:02.380]  I had a lot of fun teaching him basketball.
[27:02.380 --> 27:04.540]  I don't teach him, but talking about basketball.
[27:05.100 --> 27:07.200]  See, people don't realize that the...
[27:07.200 --> 27:09.440]  People that don't think they like sports...
[27:09.440 --> 27:11.600]  What they don't realize is that there is...
[27:11.600 --> 27:12.740]  And why I like both...
[27:12.740 --> 27:16.860]  There's no difference between the NBA and the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.
[27:17.060 --> 27:19.020]  It is the exact same.
[27:19.120 --> 27:22.560]  I actually had a So All Right that I had plotted out a while back
[27:22.560 --> 27:24.680]  where I was going to compare this season of the NBA
[27:24.680 --> 27:27.280]  to this season of Salt Lake City and Beverly Hills.
[27:27.400 --> 27:29.860]  And I got bored with Beverly Hills this season, so I didn't do it.
[27:29.860 --> 27:32.680]  All the storylines are the same.
[27:32.760 --> 27:33.800]  It's the same drama.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.920]  A lot of crossover between talent, also.
[27:39.100 --> 27:43.020]  If you like reality TV, you probably do like sports.
[27:43.140 --> 27:44.240]  Because it's just as trashy.
[27:45.600 --> 27:47.740]  You were explaining the trade deadline.
[27:47.960 --> 27:50.480]  So we're saying how the NHL trade deadline is next week.
[27:51.120 --> 27:52.780]  Yeah, theirs is a little later than the NBA.
[27:54.020 --> 27:55.620]  Here we go, we got those.
[27:55.720 --> 27:56.340]  Freddie Freeman.
[27:56.940 --> 27:58.920]  Eric's a big Freddie Freeman fan because he's a Dodger fan.
[27:59.860 --> 28:00.880]  Here's that blueprint card.
[28:01.040 --> 28:01.960]  Those are cool-ass inserts.
[28:02.120 --> 28:04.460]  I think this might be worth 15, 20 bucks or so.
[28:04.540 --> 28:04.860]  Nice.
[28:07.020 --> 28:08.440]  Here's a Ronnie Maurizio rookie.
[28:08.660 --> 28:10.520]  If he ends up being any good, that would be nice.
[28:11.980 --> 28:12.960]  Oh, wow, two of these.
[28:13.020 --> 28:13.800]  Ozzy Smith.
[28:14.380 --> 28:16.120]  Everybody loves him because he can do backflips.
[28:17.160 --> 28:17.660]  That's cool.
[28:18.100 --> 28:18.540]  He was cool.
[28:18.620 --> 28:19.320]  Freddie Freeman again.
[28:19.780 --> 28:20.840]  Mike Trout, never heard of him.
[28:21.980 --> 28:23.740]  Fran Bravaldez and Tyler O'Neal.
[28:23.840 --> 28:25.660]  And then let's look and make sure we don't have any of these old
[28:25.660 --> 28:27.120]  ones and ones in the back.
[28:27.840 --> 28:31.720]  I've also seen on Reddit a lot of people are faking making these
[28:31.720 --> 28:32.200]  one-on-ones.
[28:32.480 --> 28:32.980]  Oh, really?
[28:33.160 --> 28:34.300]  It's really not that hard.
[28:34.360 --> 28:37.560]  I mean, I have all the equipment at home to number cards because
[28:37.560 --> 28:38.560]  I was doing it for Fuckface early.
[28:38.880 --> 28:41.440]  And, yeah, so people are just making them and selling them.
[28:41.580 --> 28:42.120]  So be careful.
[28:42.920 --> 28:43.580]  Be careful.
[28:44.500 --> 28:47.300]  Someone said if we get a chance to go to the NHL stadium series,
[28:47.360 --> 28:49.440]  I assume it's the one that we were talking about where they're
[28:50.140 --> 28:51.600]  outside at football stadiums.
[28:51.620 --> 28:52.580]  They put the rink out there.
[28:52.600 --> 28:53.760]  Yes, yes, I would love to do that.
[28:53.820 --> 28:54.340]  Rangers Suarez.
[28:54.980 --> 28:58.820]  We want to go to the Field of Dreams game, but that's, I guess,
[28:58.920 --> 29:00.380]  under construction until 2025.
[29:00.760 --> 29:01.280]  So we can't go.
[29:01.460 --> 29:02.320]  But maybe whenever it's back.
[29:02.620 --> 29:02.940]  McCutcheon.
[29:03.020 --> 29:04.760]  I might get the whole run of these blueprints.
[29:05.800 --> 29:06.200]  Ronald Lacudi.
[29:06.280 --> 29:08.140]  Yeah, I really do want to go to that Field of Dreams game.
[29:08.240 --> 29:08.740]  I hope we can.
[29:09.060 --> 29:09.520]  What did you say?
[29:09.680 --> 29:10.000]  2025?
[29:10.080 --> 29:10.540]  I think so.
[29:10.620 --> 29:13.360]  I think they're probably building out that space more.
[29:15.040 --> 29:16.020]  Let's do this.
[29:16.100 --> 29:17.320]  We've been going pretty for a while.
[29:17.400 --> 29:18.220]  I don't want to bore people to death.
[29:18.580 --> 29:19.720]  I have here...
[29:19.720 --> 29:20.900]  I don't know where this came from.
[29:22.640 --> 29:24.520]  Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas.
[29:24.880 --> 29:26.140]  You love that movie.
[29:26.360 --> 29:28.780]  You like it when people make that their personality.
[29:28.860 --> 29:31.140]  You wish you could get tattoos of it.
[29:31.300 --> 29:33.240]  You wish that's how we decorate the house for Christmas,
[29:33.340 --> 29:34.360]  but I do like traditional.
[29:34.640 --> 29:35.880]  Might be one of my least favorite things.
[29:35.880 --> 29:37.100]  You love it.
[29:37.160 --> 29:37.920]  Would you rather me be really...
[29:37.920 --> 29:39.560]  This is a fucking card game, I guess.
[29:39.660 --> 29:41.020]  Bass player, sax player.
[29:41.420 --> 29:44.180]  Would you rather me be really into Pokemon or Nightmare Before Christmas?
[29:46.360 --> 29:47.960]  Like, I have it, like, everywhere.
[29:47.960 --> 29:48.960]  Like, I have...
[29:49.500 --> 29:51.500]  Say, I have, like, car seat covers.
[29:51.880 --> 29:54.160]  Nightmare Before Christmas, Nightmare Before Christmas, and here's why.
[29:55.120 --> 29:58.980]  It's holiday-themed at least, so it'll ramp up, but then it'll diminish.
[29:59.020 --> 30:00.640]  Oh, no, I'm into it all year long.
[30:01.120 --> 30:06.480]  Well, maybe you can hitch a ride on a new relationship.
[30:07.020 --> 30:07.580]  Oh, my God.
[30:08.160 --> 30:09.160]  No, no, I'm kidding.
[30:09.400 --> 30:10.380]  I'll stay married to you forever.
[30:11.640 --> 30:12.440]  Let's open up...
[30:12.440 --> 30:13.520]  What was the other thing I saw?
[30:14.520 --> 30:16.960]  What would you say is the best sport to see live?
[30:16.960 --> 30:19.680]  You haven't seen hockey yet, though, from your experience.
[30:21.260 --> 30:21.740]  Football's...
[30:21.740 --> 30:23.060]  Live football games are pretty boring.
[30:23.180 --> 30:26.300]  There's so many, like, commercial break pauses that...
[30:26.300 --> 30:26.900]  G.I. Joe.
[30:26.900 --> 30:27.260]  ...isn't fun.
[30:27.840 --> 30:28.540]  30th salute.
[30:28.740 --> 30:32.780]  I would say the most fun sport to see live is baseball.
[30:33.180 --> 30:34.040]  Why would you say that?
[30:34.960 --> 30:37.760]  The pace works well for enjoying a game.
[30:38.100 --> 30:43.000]  It's slow enough that you can get up, and you can move around, and you can explore, and you can eat.
[30:43.300 --> 30:45.200]  And you don't feel like you miss too much.
[30:45.200 --> 30:48.220]  And you can see all the action from pretty much anywhere you are.
[30:48.400 --> 30:52.100]  So if you're up, like, waiting in line for a hot dog, and you hear screaming, you can run out, and you can still see.
[30:52.500 --> 30:57.040]  It's a little harder with basketball or hockey when you get to go outside of the ring, into the ring.
[30:58.220 --> 31:00.640]  That was fun when we walked around Tiger Stadium that time.
[31:00.800 --> 31:03.000]  We just, like, got to view it from every angle.
[31:03.440 --> 31:04.520]  Yeah, it was fun.
[31:04.580 --> 31:06.320]  And I am excited to go back.
[31:06.540 --> 31:06.680]  Yeah.
[31:06.920 --> 31:07.940]  I also...
[31:07.940 --> 31:08.720]  Spend our summer there.
[31:08.860 --> 31:09.980]  I think football's kind of boring.
[31:10.880 --> 31:11.660]  NFL's kind of boring.
[31:11.800 --> 31:12.160]  In person?
[31:12.340 --> 31:12.820]  Yeah, in person.
[31:12.820 --> 31:16.620]  We went to that Lions game with Dorothy, and it was boring, but...
[31:16.620 --> 31:17.520]  It was a cool experience, but yeah.
[31:17.600 --> 31:17.800]  Yeah.
[31:18.240 --> 31:19.200]  From a watching football standpoint.
[31:19.200 --> 31:19.460]  Oh!
[31:19.760 --> 31:20.020]  Do you have any of these?
[31:20.020 --> 31:20.560]  There's a dude.
[31:20.840 --> 31:21.880]  Yeah, there's another dude.
[31:22.120 --> 31:22.940]  He doesn't have a leg.
[31:23.800 --> 31:24.140]  He doesn't?
[31:24.220 --> 31:26.160]  No, I think he was wounded.
[31:26.540 --> 31:27.480]  Oh, that's possible.
[31:27.660 --> 31:27.900]  And then...
[31:28.380 --> 31:28.700]  Does he have...
[31:28.700 --> 31:29.180]  Are those his...
[31:29.180 --> 31:31.260]  Those his sticks, or his...
[31:32.100 --> 31:32.440]  Is that a drone?
[31:32.440 --> 31:32.840]  That's his...
[31:32.840 --> 31:34.200]  That's a drone, I think he has.
[31:34.580 --> 31:34.880]  Probably.
[31:35.020 --> 31:35.800]  Did you play with G.I. Joe's?
[31:35.900 --> 31:36.780]  Yeah, of course, man.
[31:36.840 --> 31:37.480]  All about it.
[31:37.960 --> 31:38.620]  There's that dude.
[31:38.820 --> 31:40.400]  I was a big G.I. Joe fan when I was a kid.
[31:40.400 --> 31:43.080]  You like G.I. Joe and the Transformers were what you were into when you were a kid.
[31:43.640 --> 31:44.360]  And Star Wars.
[31:45.100 --> 31:45.780]  That's very cool.
[31:45.920 --> 31:47.200]  They used to have Marvel Comics.
[31:47.300 --> 31:48.000]  G.I. Joe Marvel Comics.
[31:48.100 --> 31:49.760]  And I believe that was probably a cover of one.
[31:49.840 --> 31:50.520]  It looks very familiar.
[31:50.920 --> 31:51.380]  Did you have that?
[31:51.380 --> 31:51.880]  Yeah, here you go.
[31:51.900 --> 31:52.800]  G.I. Joe number one.
[31:53.140 --> 31:53.360]  Cover.
[31:54.280 --> 31:55.360]  This is from the cartoon.
[31:55.900 --> 31:56.340]  Did I have what?
[31:56.400 --> 31:56.940]  G.I. Joe comics?
[31:57.040 --> 31:58.360]  I used to collect the shit out of those.
[31:58.820 --> 31:59.660]  Here's Action Man.
[31:59.700 --> 32:00.860]  I think he was pre-G.I. Joe.
[32:01.460 --> 32:02.880]  Here's a red cobra figure.
[32:03.020 --> 32:03.680]  That's cool.
[32:04.080 --> 32:06.420]  Here's a fucking old whatever that dude is.
[32:07.300 --> 32:07.620]  And then...
[32:07.620 --> 32:08.360]  It's like French Revolution.
[32:08.820 --> 32:10.240]  Yeah, French Revolution G.I. Joe.
[32:11.780 --> 32:13.680]  Okay, let's go back to baseball now.
[32:13.920 --> 32:14.320]  Okay.
[32:15.740 --> 32:18.260]  Football is the absolute worst sport to see live.
[32:18.400 --> 32:19.460]  It's not even close.
[32:19.560 --> 32:20.600]  I completely agree.
[32:21.360 --> 32:22.920]  What's your favorite sport to see live, Emily?
[32:24.720 --> 32:27.920]  I like watching basketball for the fast pace of it.
[32:28.000 --> 32:28.600]  But I do...
[32:28.600 --> 32:29.240]  I enjoy...
[32:30.220 --> 32:32.340]  But you have to pay attention so much all the time.
[32:32.520 --> 32:32.680]  Yeah.
[32:32.860 --> 32:35.200]  But I do like that I don't have to pay attention too much.
[32:35.280 --> 32:37.240]  And if anything happens, like...
[32:37.800 --> 32:39.260]  Whenever people even hit the baseball,
[32:39.260 --> 32:40.260]  it catches your attention.
[32:40.920 --> 32:41.300]  Mm-hmm.
[32:41.360 --> 32:42.500]  So it's enough to like...
[32:42.500 --> 32:42.660]  Ooh!
[32:42.940 --> 32:44.180]  You know, but it's not...
[32:44.180 --> 32:44.800]  And then you...
[32:44.800 --> 32:45.120]  I don't know.
[32:45.420 --> 32:45.960]  And then...
[32:45.960 --> 32:46.300]  I don't know.
[32:47.040 --> 32:47.480]  I like it.
[32:47.580 --> 32:48.120]  I like snacks.
[32:48.460 --> 32:49.000]  Snacks are great.
[32:49.140 --> 32:49.940]  Snacks are mostly all I care about.
[32:49.940 --> 32:50.620]  Snacks are the best in baseball.
[32:51.420 --> 32:52.020]  Frank Thomas.
[32:52.160 --> 32:52.460]  There you go.
[32:52.480 --> 32:52.980]  There's the big hurt.
[32:53.160 --> 32:53.520]  That's him.
[32:53.800 --> 32:54.980]  That's why I was a White Sox fan.
[32:55.260 --> 32:55.580]  Dang.
[32:55.880 --> 32:56.480]  Did he have worms?
[32:58.840 --> 32:59.160]  Uh...
[32:59.160 --> 33:02.080]  I mean, he's certainly of a size.
[33:02.400 --> 33:03.280]  Was that the generation?
[33:03.680 --> 33:05.380]  And he was definitely in the worm generation.
[33:05.500 --> 33:06.440]  But to my knowledge,
[33:06.540 --> 33:08.500]  there were never any allegations of worms.
[33:09.100 --> 33:11.360]  And he might have just been a really big, strong guy.
[33:11.520 --> 33:11.660]  Yeah?
[33:11.900 --> 33:12.260]  Okay.
[33:12.580 --> 33:13.940]  I prefer to believe that.
[33:14.560 --> 33:14.740]  Yeah.
[33:15.980 --> 33:16.860]  Have you...
[33:16.860 --> 33:17.040]  Oh, yeah.
[33:17.320 --> 33:20.580]  People are recommending you guys do a Let's Play with the NHL.
[33:20.800 --> 33:21.640]  Hockey simulator.
[33:22.300 --> 33:23.880]  But you don't really know much about hockey.
[33:24.000 --> 33:25.120]  Gavin doesn't know anything about hockey.
[33:25.160 --> 33:26.500]  I actually think...
[33:27.460 --> 33:27.600]  Uh...
[33:27.600 --> 33:29.020]  Brian Wu, 35th rookie.
[33:29.820 --> 33:30.260]  Uh...
[33:30.260 --> 33:30.860]  Sal Frelick.
[33:31.100 --> 33:31.420]  Uh...
[33:31.420 --> 33:36.840]  I actually think we might do one of the seasons of Fuck Face Off.
[33:37.040 --> 33:37.840]  Might be hockey.
[33:37.840 --> 33:38.400]  Great!
[33:38.920 --> 33:39.140]  Yeah.
[33:39.300 --> 33:40.100]  Have you all planned out your next one?
[33:40.900 --> 33:42.640]  Yeah, we're doing some preliminary work on it.
[33:43.240 --> 33:43.880]  I hope...
[33:43.880 --> 33:45.280]  Hopefully we'll have something to announce for 2Tribalone,
[33:45.320 --> 33:46.360]  because we don't want to wait too long to do it.
[33:46.400 --> 33:47.720]  There's just been so much other...
[33:47.720 --> 33:48.500]  A lot of stuff.
[33:48.580 --> 33:50.020]  ...stuff to get through, you know?
[33:50.020 --> 33:50.160]  Yeah.
[33:51.080 --> 33:51.400]  Um...
[33:51.400 --> 33:52.280]  We actually have a...
[33:52.280 --> 33:53.040]  I don't even know if it's...
[33:53.040 --> 33:55.120]  Have we announced that we're doing that trivia thing?
[33:57.560 --> 33:58.700]  I saw the...
[33:58.700 --> 34:01.820]  The Instagram post listed it coming out Wednesday,
[34:01.940 --> 34:02.980]  but we're...
[34:02.980 --> 34:05.500]  Yeah, we're doing, like, a month of trivia
[34:06.380 --> 34:07.500]  where we determine...
[34:08.380 --> 34:09.040]  Like, trivia in games,
[34:09.100 --> 34:12.120]  we determine who the smartest person in Fuck Face is.
[34:12.300 --> 34:17.560]  So it's me, Nick, Gavin, Eric, Andrew, and Gracie.
[34:19.860 --> 34:21.120]  And we compete,
[34:21.260 --> 34:22.780]  and then each week somebody is eliminated
[34:22.780 --> 34:24.260]  until we're left with the final two,
[34:24.360 --> 34:26.200]  and then it's determined the winner.
[34:26.380 --> 34:26.660]  Nice!
[34:26.740 --> 34:27.380]  I won't spoil anything.
[34:27.760 --> 34:29.820]  I also see Griff over there with a microphone,
[34:29.960 --> 34:30.560]  which scares me.
[34:31.760 --> 34:35.240]  Colton Couser, Jaron Duran, Aaron Judge,
[34:36.720 --> 34:38.940]  Johnny DeLuca, Miquel Garcia,
[34:39.080 --> 34:42.260]  Tyler Soderstream, Daniel Bard,
[34:42.400 --> 34:43.460]  I streamed earlier today,
[34:43.520 --> 34:45.680]  Logan O'Hope, Jameson Tallion,
[34:45.780 --> 34:47.460]  Bryce Harper, 35th,
[34:48.620 --> 34:49.660]  Ellie DeLaCruz.
[34:49.800 --> 34:52.020]  We'll go ahead and sleep that.
[34:52.560 --> 34:54.820]  Ba-boop, ba-beep, Connor Wong.
[34:55.540 --> 34:55.780]  Nice.
[34:56.780 --> 34:56.880]  Okay.
[34:58.340 --> 34:59.460]  After we get through this...
[34:59.820 --> 35:00.900]  Fucking hell, dude.
[35:01.140 --> 35:02.000]  There's so much.
[35:03.860 --> 35:04.740]  We're gonna go fast.
[35:04.740 --> 35:06.360]  Yeah, do it like they do in the...
[35:06.360 --> 35:08.220]  But you're gonna have to be super entertaining.
[35:08.460 --> 35:09.960]  I'm not good at that, though.
[35:10.120 --> 35:12.100]  I don't know how to do this.
[35:13.620 --> 35:14.740]  Could I sing a...
[35:15.600 --> 35:16.700]  Pick a player.
[35:17.100 --> 35:17.840]  Could I sing a...
[35:17.840 --> 35:19.820]  Okay, go through and find which one's your boyfriend.
[35:21.020 --> 35:22.440]  Oh, yeah, I was gonna play a game with you.
[35:22.540 --> 35:23.940]  I was telling Emily earlier,
[35:24.000 --> 35:25.780]  I was like, maybe we should do a Hoosier...
[35:25.780 --> 35:26.720]  Maybe we should play a game,
[35:26.840 --> 35:27.680]  just the two of us.
[35:27.760 --> 35:28.320]  And then I was thinking,
[35:28.680 --> 35:30.720]  pick out who do you think is the cutest boy on the cards.
[35:31.060 --> 35:31.740]  And she was like...
[35:32.600 --> 35:33.700]  So you can yell at me later?
[35:33.700 --> 35:34.240]  Hi.
[35:34.320 --> 35:35.260]  Are you recording or is this live?
[35:35.480 --> 35:35.740]  It's live.
[35:36.640 --> 35:38.720]  Okay, so...
[35:38.720 --> 35:40.200]  I'm also recording, but it is live.
[35:40.280 --> 35:40.980]  That makes more sense.
[35:41.100 --> 35:42.680]  Okay, so someone just told us
[35:42.680 --> 35:45.200]  that you got a Nightmare Before Christmas card.
[35:45.580 --> 35:45.700]  Yeah.
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.180]  And BK wanted me to come and steal that
[35:48.180 --> 35:49.500]  because she wants it real bad.
[35:50.600 --> 35:50.960]  What...
[35:52.040 --> 35:53.140]  What do they want?
[35:53.360 --> 35:54.240]  Well, which card?
[35:54.280 --> 35:54.880]  I need to know.
[35:55.380 --> 35:56.780]  Like, I wanna know about it.
[35:56.820 --> 35:57.460]  You wanna know about it?
[35:57.800 --> 35:58.440]  Okay, let's see.
[35:59.060 --> 35:59.700]  This is...
[35:59.700 --> 36:00.800]  Okay, come do it on the camera.
[36:01.080 --> 36:01.920]  Oh, my God.
[36:02.360 --> 36:03.100]  Okay, let's see.
[36:03.700 --> 36:04.460]  Hit your ride.
[36:04.580 --> 36:05.080]  That looks cool.
[36:05.280 --> 36:05.980]  Ooh, Jack's house.
[36:06.080 --> 36:06.520]  She loves Jack.
[36:06.520 --> 36:07.500]  It appears to be a game.
[36:07.960 --> 36:08.220]  Oh!
[36:08.900 --> 36:09.900]  So, throw me a bone.
[36:09.960 --> 36:10.840]  That's why I...
[36:10.840 --> 36:11.720]  I like throw me a bone.
[36:11.880 --> 36:12.380]  Double dead.
[36:12.540 --> 36:13.880]  I'm gonna insist you take...
[36:13.880 --> 36:15.800]  So does BK play these?
[36:16.060 --> 36:17.360]  No, she's just obsessed
[36:17.360 --> 36:18.500]  with the Nightmare Before Christmas.
[36:18.800 --> 36:19.060]  Oh.
[36:19.120 --> 36:20.280]  Like, as an adult.
[36:20.560 --> 36:21.340]  Yeah, one of those people
[36:21.340 --> 36:21.900]  we were talking about.
[36:21.940 --> 36:22.920]  So not like a Disney adult,
[36:22.980 --> 36:24.080]  but like a Nightmare Before Christmas adult.
[36:24.080 --> 36:25.460]  Which is technically kind of Disney.
[36:25.940 --> 36:26.280]  Yeah.
[36:26.500 --> 36:27.420]  Because they do have like
[36:27.420 --> 36:28.500]  Oogie Boogie Bash and stuff.
[36:28.520 --> 36:30.080]  It's Disney, but worse a little bit.
[36:30.480 --> 36:31.240]  Disney and Jason?
[36:31.380 --> 36:32.300]  I'll give these to her,
[36:32.380 --> 36:33.680]  but she has to play the game.
[36:33.700 --> 36:34.060]  Okay.
[36:34.500 --> 36:36.020]  Do you think this is enough cards
[36:36.020 --> 36:36.640]  to play the game?
[36:36.820 --> 36:37.260]  That's all we have.
[36:37.560 --> 36:38.400]  Okay, I'll...
[36:38.400 --> 36:38.900]  It's a good start.
[36:39.040 --> 36:39.840]  I'll make her figure it out.
[36:39.860 --> 36:40.440]  What are you into?
[36:40.680 --> 36:41.160]  What am I into?
[36:42.340 --> 36:43.240]  Like, what would be your
[36:43.240 --> 36:44.140]  Nightmare Before Christmas?
[36:44.360 --> 36:45.000]  Oh, man.
[36:45.560 --> 36:46.900]  Probably this Hunter x Hunter.
[36:47.280 --> 36:47.720]  I've heard of that.
[36:47.720 --> 36:48.320]  Other animes.
[36:48.580 --> 36:48.780]  Okay.
[36:48.880 --> 36:49.580]  No, you haven't.
[36:49.760 --> 36:51.800]  Yeah, I have on Bad Friends.
[36:51.920 --> 36:52.840]  That was what...
[36:52.840 --> 36:54.020]  What's-her-name was into.
[36:54.660 --> 36:55.340]  His niece.
[36:55.740 --> 36:56.420]  Oh, Rudy.
[36:56.620 --> 36:57.360]  It's a really good...
[36:57.360 --> 36:57.740]  It's a good...
[36:57.740 --> 36:58.960]  It's a good anime about friendship.
[36:59.320 --> 36:59.600]  Okay.
[36:59.640 --> 37:00.200]  And fighting.
[37:00.420 --> 37:00.760]  Okay.
[37:01.040 --> 37:01.980]  And leveling up.
[37:03.160 --> 37:04.280]  And absentee fathers.
[37:05.220 --> 37:05.560]  Oh.
[37:05.640 --> 37:06.560]  But mostly friendship.
[37:06.560 --> 37:07.080]  Something like that.
[37:07.220 --> 37:07.420]  Yeah.
[37:08.460 --> 37:09.600]  No, I had a bunch.
[37:09.700 --> 37:10.340]  I'm not an absentee.
[37:10.340 --> 37:10.960]  I'm a good dad.
[37:11.000 --> 37:12.180]  No, you're a great dad,
[37:12.300 --> 37:13.080]  but you had a couple
[37:13.560 --> 37:14.240]  absentee dads.
[37:14.620 --> 37:15.160]  You had a couple
[37:15.160 --> 37:15.860]  absentee dads?
[37:16.100 --> 37:16.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[37:17.100 --> 37:18.000]  Why just one?
[37:18.200 --> 37:18.720]  Why just one?
[37:18.920 --> 37:20.100]  It takes a real man
[37:20.100 --> 37:21.300]  to be an absentee stepfather.
[37:22.280 --> 37:23.620]  Anyway, thank you for these.
[37:23.700 --> 37:24.180]  I'm going to go back
[37:24.180 --> 37:25.140]  to doing my live stream.
[37:25.260 --> 37:25.780]  I appreciate it.
[37:25.920 --> 37:26.080]  Nice.
[37:26.100 --> 37:26.720]  It was good to see you.
[37:26.900 --> 37:27.640]  Hi, Emily.
[37:27.960 --> 37:29.100]  I didn't realize
[37:29.100 --> 37:29.860]  you guys had never met.
[37:30.640 --> 37:31.620]  I love it.
[37:31.860 --> 37:32.140]  Good.
[37:32.560 --> 37:32.860]  All right.
[37:32.960 --> 37:33.620]  Have a good stream.
[37:33.760 --> 37:34.480]  I'm going to go.
[37:34.620 --> 37:35.440]  She'll like these.
[37:35.800 --> 37:35.960]  Yeah.
[37:36.440 --> 37:37.960]  Let her know we're in here
[37:37.960 --> 37:38.540]  if she needs more.
[37:38.800 --> 37:39.440]  Thank you.
[37:40.400 --> 37:42.160]  Yeah, we just
[37:42.160 --> 37:42.840]  crossed the streams.
[37:43.060 --> 37:44.060]  They said not to do that
[37:44.060 --> 37:44.480]  in Ghostbusters,
[37:44.660 --> 37:45.200]  but we don't care.
[37:45.560 --> 37:46.100]  Henry Davis,
[37:46.260 --> 37:46.920]  just leave that.
[37:47.080 --> 37:47.880]  Justin Steele,
[37:48.320 --> 37:49.060]  Elites of the Game,
[37:50.180 --> 37:50.900]  Griffey Jr.,
[37:50.900 --> 37:51.600]  Celebration of the Kid.
[37:51.880 --> 37:52.680]  Boy, we're really not
[37:52.680 --> 37:53.420]  seeing a lot of money
[37:53.420 --> 37:54.340]  out of these cards so far,
[37:54.400 --> 37:54.560]  right?
[37:54.880 --> 37:55.240]  Nope.
[37:55.860 --> 37:56.980]  Nothing seems to be
[37:56.980 --> 37:58.700]  worthy of my...
[37:58.700 --> 38:00.400]  I don't see a single
[38:01.360 --> 38:02.160]  Kevin Hart
[38:02.160 --> 38:03.700]  anywhere on that card.
[38:05.760 --> 38:06.160]  Uh...
[38:06.160 --> 38:06.600]  Well...
[38:06.600 --> 38:07.440]  So that was Griff
[38:08.120 --> 38:09.180]  with two Fs.
[38:09.880 --> 38:10.120]  Yeah.
[38:10.360 --> 38:11.420]  I just did a game show
[38:11.420 --> 38:11.940]  with Griff.
[38:12.580 --> 38:13.120]  Yeah, you did.
[38:13.340 --> 38:14.060]  Yeah, last week.
[38:15.320 --> 38:15.720]  Um...
[38:15.720 --> 38:17.800]  I can't say how I did.
[38:17.900 --> 38:18.520]  I got nervous
[38:18.520 --> 38:19.540]  because they always come in
[38:19.540 --> 38:20.660]  and on, like,
[38:20.680 --> 38:21.560]  what I see online
[38:21.560 --> 38:22.540]  where they'll ask, like,
[38:22.580 --> 38:23.920]  is it problematic questions?
[38:24.120 --> 38:24.280]  And I was like...
[38:24.280 --> 38:24.760]  Oh, you're going to get
[38:24.760 --> 38:25.380]  problematic-ed?
[38:25.460 --> 38:25.920]  Oh, no.
[38:25.920 --> 38:26.520]  Oh, no.
[38:26.620 --> 38:27.080]  I don't...
[38:27.080 --> 38:27.600]  I think so.
[38:27.740 --> 38:28.120]  I don't know.
[38:29.140 --> 38:30.180]  Just say everything
[38:30.180 --> 38:30.840]  is problematic.
[38:31.100 --> 38:32.280]  Everything is problematic.
[38:33.220 --> 38:33.420]  Uh...
[38:33.420 --> 38:34.080]  Sedan Raffaello.
[38:34.180 --> 38:34.600]  We're getting a lot of
[38:34.600 --> 38:35.880]  these rookie cards.
[38:35.960 --> 38:36.360]  That's cool.
[38:37.040 --> 38:37.520]  Juan Soto.
[38:37.860 --> 38:38.500]  Everybody's favorite
[38:38.500 --> 38:39.360]  padre right there.
[38:39.420 --> 38:40.340]  Juan Soto, number one
[38:40.340 --> 38:40.620]  padre.
[38:40.760 --> 38:41.260]  Am I right, Eric?
[38:41.380 --> 38:41.800]  Here, I'll give this
[38:41.800 --> 38:42.360]  to you right here.
[38:44.580 --> 38:45.380]  Is that his favorite
[38:45.380 --> 38:45.660]  padre?
[38:45.860 --> 38:46.480]  Oh, it's his...
[38:46.480 --> 38:47.280]  Hands down his
[38:47.280 --> 38:47.820]  favorite padre.
[38:47.960 --> 38:48.640]  I mean, he's not
[38:48.640 --> 38:49.560]  a padre anymore,
[38:49.680 --> 38:50.120]  unfortunately.
[38:50.320 --> 38:51.120]  He went to the Yankees
[38:51.120 --> 38:51.600]  in the offseason,
[38:51.700 --> 38:52.260]  but I don't think Eric
[38:52.260 --> 38:52.520]  cares.
[38:52.640 --> 38:53.100]  I think he's going to
[38:53.100 --> 38:53.760]  follow him to the
[38:53.760 --> 38:54.400]  Yankees anyway.
[38:54.620 --> 38:55.500]  That's his Marcus Smart?
[38:55.740 --> 38:56.360]  Yeah, that's kind of
[38:56.360 --> 38:57.280]  like his Marcus Smart.
[38:57.520 --> 38:58.200]  Yeah, he...
[38:58.200 --> 38:59.420]  I think he probably
[38:59.420 --> 39:00.240]  writes letters to him
[39:00.240 --> 39:00.600]  and stuff.
[39:00.720 --> 39:01.280]  Does he send him
[39:01.280 --> 39:01.940]  DMs of like,
[39:02.000 --> 39:02.600]  good luck tonight?
[39:02.720 --> 39:03.040]  Yeah, good luck
[39:03.040 --> 39:03.580]  in the game tonight.
[39:03.620 --> 39:04.160]  Yeah, I'll be
[39:04.160 --> 39:04.740]  rooting for you.
[39:05.520 --> 39:06.340]  You're my number
[39:06.340 --> 39:07.000]  one player.
[39:07.140 --> 39:07.700]  That's what he says.
[39:07.940 --> 39:08.620]  Oh, you're the one
[39:08.620 --> 39:09.080]  for me.
[39:09.200 --> 39:09.640]  Yeah, you're the
[39:09.640 --> 39:10.040]  one for me.
[39:10.860 --> 39:11.520]  I think he had a
[39:11.520 --> 39:12.240]  shirt like that once.
[39:12.700 --> 39:13.420]  I think Barbara's
[39:13.420 --> 39:13.980]  in the chat.
[39:14.860 --> 39:15.420]  Barbara Dunkleman.
[39:15.600 --> 39:15.980]  Oh, what's up
[39:15.980 --> 39:16.240]  with her?
[39:17.240 --> 39:17.700]  All right, I think
[39:17.700 --> 39:18.200]  these are going to
[39:18.200 --> 39:18.840]  be our retail.
[39:19.300 --> 39:19.740]  But in this,
[39:20.840 --> 39:21.360]  they're just called
[39:21.360 --> 39:21.920]  retail packs.
[39:22.000 --> 39:22.360]  You're just meant
[39:22.360 --> 39:23.040]  to buy the individual
[39:23.040 --> 39:23.420]  packs.
[39:23.620 --> 39:24.360]  And I think...
[39:24.360 --> 39:25.100]  It says autograph
[39:25.100 --> 39:25.940]  and relic cards.
[39:26.160 --> 39:26.940]  Ooh, I think it's
[39:26.940 --> 39:27.240]  going to...
[39:27.240 --> 39:27.780]  Let's do this one
[39:27.780 --> 39:28.000]  first.
[39:29.200 --> 39:29.860]  Okay, I'll do
[39:29.860 --> 39:30.240]  that one first.
[39:30.360 --> 39:30.840]  Oh, I need you
[39:32.440 --> 39:32.720]  to...
[39:32.720 --> 39:33.540]  These will go
[39:33.540 --> 39:33.980]  in that.
[39:34.340 --> 39:34.640]  And then these
[39:34.640 --> 39:35.160]  will go in this.
[39:35.160 --> 39:35.740]  I forgot we need
[39:35.740 --> 39:36.360]  to separate these.
[39:36.680 --> 39:36.880]  All right.
[39:37.260 --> 39:37.880]  And then we have
[39:37.880 --> 39:38.900]  21 minutes and
[39:38.900 --> 39:39.400]  two...
[39:39.400 --> 39:40.100]  Fucking hell.
[39:40.300 --> 39:41.220]  Two more boxes
[39:41.220 --> 39:41.920]  after this, but the
[39:41.920 --> 39:42.620]  two more boxes after
[39:42.620 --> 39:43.160]  this are the big
[39:43.160 --> 39:43.480]  boxes.
[39:43.700 --> 39:43.940]  Can you have
[39:43.940 --> 39:44.240]  what, babe?
[39:44.560 --> 39:44.920]  I don't know.
[39:44.920 --> 39:45.520]  O'Neal Cruz,
[39:45.780 --> 39:46.300]  Bobby Miller,
[39:46.540 --> 39:47.160]  Justin Lawrence,
[39:47.320 --> 39:48.120]  Jake Cronenworth,
[39:48.260 --> 39:49.040]  Christian Betancourt,
[39:49.180 --> 39:49.800]  Brendan White,
[39:50.000 --> 39:50.700]  Tarek Skubal,
[39:50.820 --> 39:51.560]  Luis Matos.
[39:52.280 --> 39:52.760]  Here's a
[39:52.760 --> 39:53.360]  Mike Trout card.
[39:54.280 --> 39:55.360]  So, so far, I'm
[39:55.360 --> 39:56.540]  thinking you're
[39:56.540 --> 39:58.740]  probably not going
[39:58.740 --> 39:59.100]  to get...
[39:59.100 --> 39:59.440]  You're not going to
[39:59.440 --> 39:59.940]  make your money back
[39:59.940 --> 40:00.500]  if you buy any of
[40:00.500 --> 40:00.880]  these cards.
[40:02.320 --> 40:03.240]  The chat was telling
[40:03.240 --> 40:03.780]  me that I really
[40:03.780 --> 40:05.080]  blew it on talking
[40:05.080 --> 40:05.860]  to Griff about
[40:05.860 --> 40:07.080]  Clutch My Pearls,
[40:07.480 --> 40:08.100]  that they would be
[40:08.100 --> 40:08.720]  into that kind of
[40:08.720 --> 40:09.440]  stuff or like even
[40:09.440 --> 40:10.200]  like the fanfic.
[40:10.440 --> 40:11.160]  Griff is really
[40:11.160 --> 40:13.440]  into like those
[40:13.440 --> 40:14.000]  home...
[40:14.000 --> 40:14.440]  Not homework.
[40:14.540 --> 40:14.820]  What's the other
[40:14.820 --> 40:14.920]  one?
[40:14.980 --> 40:15.620]  Lifetime movies?
[40:15.820 --> 40:16.060]  Uh-huh.
[40:16.060 --> 40:17.880]  Where it's like the
[40:17.880 --> 40:18.980]  nanny tries to
[40:18.980 --> 40:19.980]  kill the husband
[40:19.980 --> 40:20.640]  and take over
[40:20.640 --> 40:21.180]  the family or
[40:21.180 --> 40:21.400]  whatever.
[40:21.960 --> 40:22.060]  Oh, like
[40:22.060 --> 40:22.200]  thrillers?
[40:22.200 --> 40:22.380]  Yeah, like thrillers
[40:22.380 --> 40:22.700]  kind of.
[40:22.860 --> 40:23.520]  Like when I was
[40:23.520 --> 40:24.940]  on their podcast,
[40:25.160 --> 40:25.600]  or not podcast,
[40:25.720 --> 40:26.340]  the game show,
[40:26.520 --> 40:27.000]  they were telling
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.020]  me about this movie
[40:29.020 --> 40:30.220]  where a plane crashes
[40:30.220 --> 40:31.240]  and the stewardess
[40:31.240 --> 40:32.180]  and the pilot have
[40:32.180 --> 40:32.720]  sex on a dead
[40:32.720 --> 40:33.300]  body or something.
[40:33.480 --> 40:33.840]  What?
[40:34.100 --> 40:34.600]  Yeah, and it's
[40:34.600 --> 40:35.560]  a deadly...
[40:35.560 --> 40:36.600]  Was it Stevie and
[40:36.600 --> 40:37.560]  Xander from Mile High?
[40:37.780 --> 40:38.500]  It might have been.
[40:38.860 --> 40:39.380]  Trey Grisham,
[40:39.560 --> 40:40.180]  another Henry Davis
[40:40.180 --> 40:40.440]  based.
[40:40.540 --> 40:40.960]  That's nice.
[40:41.080 --> 40:41.300]  We'll just
[40:41.300 --> 40:41.700]  leave that.
[40:42.460 --> 40:42.920]  Johnny Menz's
[40:42.920 --> 40:44.020]  Trey Cabbage.
[40:44.780 --> 40:45.580]  Kurt Crawford.
[40:45.740 --> 40:46.400]  Here's Corbin
[40:46.400 --> 40:46.880]  Carroll.
[40:47.140 --> 40:47.920]  That's cool.
[40:48.460 --> 40:49.380]  The Tyler Soda
[40:49.380 --> 40:49.960]  stream.
[40:50.320 --> 40:50.680]  If anybody wants
[40:50.680 --> 40:51.740]  our extra Tyler Soda
[40:51.740 --> 40:52.300]  streams, we have a
[40:52.300 --> 40:52.680]  thousand.
[40:53.600 --> 40:54.060]  Yeah.
[40:54.640 --> 40:55.400]  I'm gonna guess
[40:55.400 --> 40:55.820]  none of these
[40:55.820 --> 40:56.160]  are them.
[40:58.420 --> 40:59.260]  How's everybody's
[40:59.260 --> 41:00.380]  Monday so far?
[41:01.240 --> 41:01.260]  It's a Monday.
[41:02.120 --> 41:02.800]  Had a pretty good
[41:02.800 --> 41:03.040]  one.
[41:03.320 --> 41:03.880]  Weather's nice.
[41:04.040 --> 41:04.740]  Albie is a
[41:04.740 --> 41:05.400]  cutie-tootie.
[41:05.660 --> 41:05.960]  Yeah, you can
[41:05.960 --> 41:06.520]  say his name now.
[41:06.640 --> 41:06.860]  I know.
[41:06.960 --> 41:07.320]  I got scared
[41:07.320 --> 41:07.700]  for a second.
[41:07.960 --> 41:08.380]  Oh God,
[41:08.500 --> 41:09.000]  Jack's here.
[41:09.300 --> 41:09.900]  Oh no.
[41:09.920 --> 41:10.580]  Jack's here.
[41:11.380 --> 41:11.840]  Cut a
[41:11.840 --> 41:12.280]  thin guy.
[41:13.040 --> 41:14.200]  Here we have a...
[41:14.200 --> 41:14.660]  Oh, look at
[41:14.660 --> 41:15.060]  this.
[41:15.240 --> 41:15.880]  Were you wanting
[41:15.880 --> 41:16.700]  all of the
[41:17.240 --> 41:17.600]  sodas?
[41:17.720 --> 41:18.740]  You have a weapon
[41:18.740 --> 41:19.620]  on site.
[41:19.820 --> 41:20.600]  I cut stuff,
[41:20.720 --> 41:20.820]  man.
[41:22.000 --> 41:22.720]  Well, I wish you
[41:22.720 --> 41:23.040]  wouldn't have cut
[41:23.040 --> 41:23.360]  that.
[41:26.180 --> 41:27.020]  You got your
[41:27.020 --> 41:27.500]  Gavin shorts
[41:27.500 --> 41:27.740]  on?
[41:27.960 --> 41:28.320]  I do.
[41:28.760 --> 41:29.200]  Oh my gosh.
[41:29.880 --> 41:30.740]  Thank you very
[41:30.740 --> 41:30.960]  much.
[41:31.040 --> 41:31.380]  You can sit
[41:31.380 --> 41:32.100]  on Eric's lap.
[41:32.460 --> 41:32.760]  Yeah, if you
[41:32.760 --> 41:33.500]  just wanna...
[41:33.500 --> 41:34.640]  Is this what he
[41:34.640 --> 41:35.180]  uses to feel
[41:35.180 --> 41:35.460]  taller?
[41:35.460 --> 41:36.380]  Yeah, he's a little
[41:36.380 --> 41:36.800]  guy.
[41:38.040 --> 41:38.760]  He just sat
[41:38.760 --> 41:39.220]  on his card.
[41:39.260 --> 41:39.840]  I just sat on his
[41:39.840 --> 41:40.060]  card.
[41:40.140 --> 41:40.480]  That's okay.
[41:40.520 --> 41:40.840]  He'll be fine.
[41:40.920 --> 41:41.320]  Hey, Geoff, do you
[41:41.320 --> 41:42.260]  wanna go play Uno and
[41:42.260 --> 41:42.960]  I can open cards?
[41:43.200 --> 41:43.480]  No.
[41:43.720 --> 41:44.240]  We're playing Uno
[41:44.240 --> 41:45.060]  over at Inside Gaming.
[41:45.280 --> 41:46.740]  We did a round of
[41:46.740 --> 41:48.040]  Uno at home with
[41:48.660 --> 41:49.420]  Vanessa and
[41:49.420 --> 41:50.560]  Burndog for her
[41:50.560 --> 41:51.840]  birthday and it
[41:51.840 --> 41:53.800]  lasted four hours, I
[41:53.800 --> 41:54.000]  think?
[41:54.060 --> 41:54.480]  It was about three
[41:54.480 --> 41:55.200]  and a half hours
[41:55.200 --> 41:56.280]  before we...
[41:56.280 --> 41:56.780]  We're on our
[41:56.780 --> 41:57.600]  fourth stream, so
[41:57.600 --> 41:58.640]  we're into our
[41:58.640 --> 41:59.680]  tenth hour of
[41:59.680 --> 42:00.660]  playing Uno right
[42:00.660 --> 42:00.880]  now.
[42:01.000 --> 42:01.480]  Anybody close to
[42:01.480 --> 42:01.620]  winning?
[42:02.060 --> 42:02.300]  No.
[42:02.420 --> 42:02.860]  Well, we're trying
[42:02.860 --> 42:03.200]  to...
[42:03.200 --> 42:04.260]  Basically, every round,
[42:04.700 --> 42:05.740]  we chat.
[42:05.840 --> 42:06.360]  If they give us
[42:06.360 --> 42:07.180]  more subscribers, we
[42:07.180 --> 42:07.860]  add more rounds.
[42:07.980 --> 42:08.280]  Oh.
[42:08.380 --> 42:09.040]  So we keep getting
[42:09.040 --> 42:09.280]  like...
[42:09.280 --> 42:09.580]  We were getting
[42:09.580 --> 42:10.500]  lower and then
[42:10.500 --> 42:10.920]  they would just
[42:10.920 --> 42:11.740]  buy more and so
[42:11.740 --> 42:12.140]  we have to keep
[42:12.140 --> 42:12.380]  playing.
[42:12.500 --> 42:13.040]  But today's our
[42:13.040 --> 42:13.900]  finale, so...
[42:13.900 --> 42:14.440]  Ooh.
[42:14.640 --> 42:14.880]  Yeah.
[42:15.740 --> 42:16.620]  And is there any
[42:16.620 --> 42:17.240]  different kind of
[42:17.240 --> 42:17.680]  rules that you're
[42:17.680 --> 42:18.120]  doing or just
[42:18.120 --> 42:18.460]  straight?
[42:18.920 --> 42:19.880]  So the whole thing
[42:19.880 --> 42:20.480]  started, we were
[42:20.480 --> 42:21.080]  playing this game
[42:21.080 --> 42:21.780]  called Party Animals
[42:21.780 --> 42:22.680]  and there's like a
[42:22.680 --> 42:23.440]  lobby area you can
[42:23.440 --> 42:24.040]  go to and there's
[42:24.040 --> 42:25.100]  like a Uno clone
[42:25.100 --> 42:25.520]  and we're like,
[42:25.580 --> 42:26.140]  oh, we'll play this
[42:26.140 --> 42:26.560]  until we get the
[42:26.560 --> 42:27.020]  game going.
[42:27.500 --> 42:27.920]  And then someone's
[42:27.920 --> 42:28.320]  like, I'll donate
[42:28.320 --> 42:29.320]  five subs if you
[42:29.320 --> 42:29.780]  guys play another
[42:29.780 --> 42:30.100]  round.
[42:30.200 --> 42:30.500]  And so we're like,
[42:30.540 --> 42:30.800]  okay.
[42:30.880 --> 42:31.240]  And then they
[42:31.240 --> 42:32.140]  started flooding in
[42:32.140 --> 42:32.720]  and saying that
[42:32.720 --> 42:33.440]  we're never actually
[42:33.440 --> 42:34.240]  playing that game.
[42:35.400 --> 42:35.800]  Geoff, you're not
[42:35.800 --> 42:36.160]  saying what the
[42:36.160 --> 42:36.720]  name of the card
[42:36.720 --> 42:36.740]  is.
[42:36.740 --> 42:37.260]  Also, I'm listening
[42:37.260 --> 42:37.700]  to you talk.
[42:37.840 --> 42:38.780]  So what version
[42:39.180 --> 42:39.580]  of...
[42:39.580 --> 42:40.300]  Well, who's Luciano?
[42:40.480 --> 42:41.420]  What about Keller and
[42:41.420 --> 42:41.680]  Brown?
[42:42.000 --> 42:42.660]  They all have juicy
[42:42.660 --> 42:42.940]  booties.
[42:42.960 --> 42:43.260]  I'm pointing out
[42:43.260 --> 42:43.920]  anything that matters.
[42:44.460 --> 42:46.120]  What version of
[42:46.120 --> 42:46.640]  Uno are you playing?
[42:46.720 --> 42:47.120]  Because we played
[42:47.120 --> 42:47.780]  one the other night
[42:47.780 --> 42:48.700]  that had new cards
[42:48.700 --> 42:49.440]  that I...
[42:49.440 --> 42:50.520]  It's Party Animals.
[42:50.880 --> 42:51.740]  We had the, like,
[42:51.840 --> 42:52.700]  when the card...
[42:52.700 --> 42:53.500]  Ours was...
[42:53.500 --> 42:54.120]  We weren't on
[42:54.120 --> 42:54.800]  computers.
[42:54.980 --> 42:55.300]  We were on
[42:56.320 --> 42:57.280]  physical copy, I
[42:57.280 --> 42:57.420]  guess.
[42:57.680 --> 42:58.120]  Yeah, we were
[42:58.120 --> 42:58.640]  on old school.
[42:58.720 --> 42:59.400]  We were on analog.
[43:00.100 --> 43:00.500]  Yeah.
[43:00.500 --> 43:01.900]  It had the ones
[43:01.900 --> 43:02.040]  where...
[43:02.040 --> 43:02.340]  You know, there's
[43:02.340 --> 43:03.340]  thousands of dollars
[43:03.340 --> 43:04.100]  of the cards under
[43:04.100 --> 43:04.220]  that.
[43:04.220 --> 43:04.900]  Oh, that's weird.
[43:05.060 --> 43:05.240]  Yeah.
[43:05.380 --> 43:05.680]  Okay.
[43:07.080 --> 43:08.220]  I get some ASMR
[43:08.220 --> 43:08.960]  for the kids.
[43:09.440 --> 43:10.380]  Is, uh...
[43:10.380 --> 43:11.320]  What do you think's
[43:11.320 --> 43:11.780]  probably happening
[43:11.780 --> 43:12.380]  to your stream
[43:12.380 --> 43:12.820]  right now?
[43:13.320 --> 43:14.200]  Um, I think we're
[43:14.200 --> 43:14.700]  just watching
[43:14.700 --> 43:15.260]  Supreme Court
[43:15.260 --> 43:15.980]  stuff right now.
[43:16.040 --> 43:16.280]  Oh.
[43:16.640 --> 43:17.420]  Supreme Court
[43:17.420 --> 43:17.820]  stuff?
[43:18.060 --> 43:18.420]  Yeah.
[43:19.600 --> 43:20.000]  Why?
[43:20.080 --> 43:20.520]  Also, don't forget
[43:20.520 --> 43:21.280]  to vote tomorrow.
[43:21.420 --> 43:22.060]  Super Tuesday's
[43:22.060 --> 43:22.740]  tomorrow, everyone.
[43:22.740 --> 43:24.280]  Go out and vote
[43:24.280 --> 43:24.840]  if you can
[43:25.300 --> 43:25.760]  in your state
[43:25.760 --> 43:26.380]  tomorrow.
[43:28.660 --> 43:29.140]  Uh...
[43:29.140 --> 43:29.940]  Yeah.
[43:30.060 --> 43:31.020]  Chris McCormick.
[43:33.500 --> 43:34.820]  Jack, what's
[43:34.820 --> 43:35.360]  your favorite?
[43:35.480 --> 43:36.560]  Since we blew it
[43:36.560 --> 43:37.000]  with Griff.
[43:37.160 --> 43:38.340]  What's your favorite
[43:38.340 --> 43:39.740]  smut to read?
[43:40.000 --> 43:40.540]  Oh, man.
[43:40.980 --> 43:41.760]  Or fanfic.
[43:42.480 --> 43:43.260]  Usually it's
[43:43.260 --> 43:44.540]  Reddit slash
[43:44.540 --> 43:45.560]  r slash politics.
[43:45.840 --> 43:46.420]  Oh, that's where
[43:46.420 --> 43:46.980]  you get it all.
[43:47.100 --> 43:48.000]  That's where I get
[43:48.000 --> 43:48.860]  my anger.
[43:49.040 --> 43:49.360]  You're like,
[43:49.440 --> 43:50.780]  ooh, he's running
[43:50.780 --> 43:51.140]  again.
[43:51.140 --> 43:52.840]  Yeah, it hurts
[43:52.840 --> 43:53.900]  and I feel bad.
[43:54.360 --> 43:55.240]  You know, really,
[43:55.360 --> 43:55.800]  because it's like,
[43:56.060 --> 43:56.420]  if you're going to
[43:56.420 --> 43:57.340]  screw someone,
[43:57.480 --> 43:57.900]  at least screw
[43:57.900 --> 43:58.620]  half the country,
[43:58.760 --> 43:59.820]  I say is probably
[43:59.820 --> 44:00.700]  the best way to do it.
[44:00.700 --> 44:01.300]  The most efficient
[44:01.300 --> 44:01.900]  way to do it.
[44:02.140 --> 44:02.920]  True, true.
[44:03.220 --> 44:03.960]  What are those?
[44:04.320 --> 44:05.180]  You got some
[44:05.180 --> 44:06.260]  elemental cards there?
[44:06.340 --> 44:06.980]  Are those frames
[44:06.980 --> 44:07.400]  from the movie?
[44:07.840 --> 44:08.260]  Yeah, those are
[44:08.260 --> 44:08.840]  frames from the movie.
[44:09.080 --> 44:09.220]  Jealous?
[44:09.900 --> 44:10.840]  I'm very jealous.
[44:11.020 --> 44:11.420]  Did you like
[44:11.420 --> 44:11.980]  Elemental?
[44:12.040 --> 44:12.420]  We didn't know
[44:12.420 --> 44:12.940]  anything about it.
[44:13.320 --> 44:14.600]  Uh, it's okay,
[44:14.880 --> 44:16.440]  but in a lot of
[44:16.440 --> 44:17.400]  at least old school
[44:17.400 --> 44:18.040]  Pixar stuff,
[44:18.180 --> 44:18.980]  the moral of the story
[44:18.980 --> 44:19.560]  is usually kind of
[44:19.560 --> 44:20.760]  subtle and kind of like,
[44:21.060 --> 44:21.880]  you know, you can't
[44:21.880 --> 44:22.580]  kind of get there.
[44:22.800 --> 44:22.900]  Yeah.
[44:23.160 --> 44:23.980]  This, it kind of
[44:23.980 --> 44:24.680]  slaps you in the face
[44:24.680 --> 44:25.440]  with it the whole time.
[44:25.600 --> 44:25.920]  And it's like,
[44:26.020 --> 44:26.780]  oh, this movie's
[44:26.780 --> 44:27.300]  about racism.
[44:27.460 --> 44:27.880]  Got it.
[44:27.980 --> 44:28.540]  Is it really?
[44:28.620 --> 44:28.880]  Oh yeah.
[44:29.040 --> 44:29.500]  The whole movie's
[44:29.500 --> 44:29.640]  about racism.
[44:29.640 --> 44:30.360]  Which is a problem
[44:30.360 --> 44:30.980]  because Jack is
[44:30.980 --> 44:31.580]  super racist.
[44:31.820 --> 44:32.260]  Well, that's why
[44:32.260 --> 44:33.440]  he likes to R-Politics
[44:33.440 --> 44:34.140]  subreddit so much
[44:34.140 --> 44:35.100]  jerking off to it.
[44:35.280 --> 44:35.420]  Yeah.
[44:36.780 --> 44:37.580]  On that note,
[44:38.260 --> 44:38.640]  hey, you guys
[44:38.640 --> 44:39.660]  should record the
[44:40.460 --> 44:40.820]  Yeah.
[44:41.760 --> 44:44.600]  Hey, can I toss this?
[44:45.320 --> 44:45.500]  No.
[44:45.580 --> 44:46.300]  Is this important?
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.060]  That was a gift.
[44:48.240 --> 44:48.420]  No.
[44:48.560 --> 44:49.740]  It's in the plastic thing.
[44:49.800 --> 44:50.320]  Let me get it out.
[44:50.640 --> 44:51.480]  Those are really
[44:51.480 --> 44:52.100]  special gifts.
[44:52.280 --> 44:53.140]  It's in the plastic.
[44:53.240 --> 44:53.860]  I wanted to get it out
[44:53.860 --> 44:54.160]  for you.
[44:54.240 --> 44:54.760]  Hey, it's probably
[44:54.760 --> 44:56.320]  pretty cool over
[44:56.320 --> 44:56.900]  on your stream.
[44:57.680 --> 44:58.220]  What is this?
[44:58.280 --> 44:59.000]  Do you want to open
[44:59.000 --> 45:00.380]  up one of these?
[45:00.380 --> 45:00.680]  I would love to.
[45:00.980 --> 45:01.800]  I see a Twilight
[45:01.800 --> 45:02.660]  card pack.
[45:03.380 --> 45:04.060]  You like Twilight.
[45:04.320 --> 45:04.940]  You can have that.
[45:05.400 --> 45:06.120]  Series 2?
[45:06.460 --> 45:07.080]  You're really into
[45:07.080 --> 45:07.860]  the Omegaverse,
[45:07.940 --> 45:08.280]  aren't you?
[45:08.280 --> 45:08.840]  Yeah.
[45:09.080 --> 45:09.420]  Omegaverse.
[45:09.560 --> 45:10.080]  What is that?
[45:10.740 --> 45:11.520]  It's like that kind
[45:11.520 --> 45:11.880]  of stuff.
[45:12.740 --> 45:13.140]  Twilight?
[45:13.600 --> 45:13.720]  Sure.
[45:14.240 --> 45:14.640]  Kristen...
[45:14.640 --> 45:15.380]  I'm not Kristen
[45:15.380 --> 45:15.560]  Ritter.
[45:15.700 --> 45:16.320]  What's Kristen Stewart?
[45:16.620 --> 45:16.800]  Yeah.
[45:16.960 --> 45:17.620]  And Kristen Ritter
[45:17.620 --> 45:18.300]  is in it as well,
[45:18.360 --> 45:18.660]  I believe.
[45:18.880 --> 45:19.960]  And what's his name?
[45:20.340 --> 45:20.740]  Sharkboy.
[45:20.960 --> 45:21.420]  Dog Dicks.
[45:21.520 --> 45:21.680]  Yeah.
[45:24.480 --> 45:24.880]  Yeah.
[45:25.300 --> 45:25.440]  That's right.
[45:25.460 --> 45:25.880]  That's what he likes.
[45:26.060 --> 45:26.860]  Werewolves have dog
[45:26.860 --> 45:27.120]  dicks.
[45:27.200 --> 45:27.760]  It's the Omegaverse.
[45:27.900 --> 45:28.280]  He's really
[45:28.280 --> 45:29.520]  specific about it.
[45:29.720 --> 45:30.300]  So that doesn't
[45:30.300 --> 45:30.980]  change back?
[45:31.520 --> 45:31.960]  No.
[45:32.380 --> 45:33.260]  Like a knot
[45:33.260 --> 45:33.760]  appears,
[45:34.020 --> 45:34.660]  and then you
[45:34.660 --> 45:35.760]  stay in,
[45:35.920 --> 45:36.420]  and then once
[45:36.960 --> 45:37.660]  it's for breeding
[45:37.660 --> 45:38.180]  purposes.
[45:38.380 --> 45:39.080]  Is it like the
[45:40.200 --> 45:41.060]  shape of water?
[45:41.280 --> 45:41.920]  This isn't a
[45:41.920 --> 45:42.880]  political or a
[45:42.880 --> 45:43.480]  sex one.
[45:43.660 --> 45:44.460]  This is just about
[45:44.460 --> 45:44.960]  cards.
[45:45.480 --> 45:46.080]  And it kind of ran
[45:46.080 --> 45:46.820]  off the rails.
[45:47.040 --> 45:47.820]  Yeah, everybody
[45:47.820 --> 45:48.880]  on Earth is
[45:48.880 --> 45:49.600]  desperate to get
[45:49.600 --> 45:50.040]  on camera,
[45:50.220 --> 45:51.060]  and so they
[45:51.060 --> 45:51.460]  heard we were
[45:51.460 --> 45:51.840]  live.
[45:52.520 --> 45:53.120]  No, we're live
[45:53.120 --> 45:53.720]  right now too.
[45:54.320 --> 45:54.860]  You should go
[45:54.860 --> 45:55.440]  check that out.
[45:55.820 --> 45:56.400]  Look at this
[45:56.400 --> 45:56.720]  fucking
[45:56.720 --> 45:57.380]  Mark Vienzo.
[45:57.840 --> 45:58.980]  You can go to
[45:58.980 --> 45:59.740]  twitch.tv
[45:59.740 --> 46:00.480]  slash roosterteeth
[46:00.480 --> 46:01.240]  right now.
[46:01.300 --> 46:02.240]  You can support
[46:02.240 --> 46:03.120]  Jack in the chat
[46:03.120 --> 46:04.360]  to say that he's
[46:04.360 --> 46:05.420]  a huge MAGA fan.
[46:05.540 --> 46:06.240]  We're celebrating
[46:06.240 --> 46:07.280]  Women's History
[46:07.280 --> 46:08.060]  Month right now
[46:08.760 --> 46:09.740]  over at
[46:09.740 --> 46:10.220]  twitch.tv
[46:10.220 --> 46:10.940]  slash roosterteeth.
[46:11.040 --> 46:11.560]  I know they don't
[46:11.560 --> 46:12.240]  celebrate anything
[46:12.240 --> 46:13.000]  like that over here.
[46:13.060 --> 46:14.920]  I heard that you
[46:14.920 --> 46:15.840]  identify as
[46:15.840 --> 46:16.780]  non-Bidenary.
[46:18.700 --> 46:19.640]  You found my
[46:19.640 --> 46:19.920]  shirt?
[46:20.140 --> 46:20.480]  I did.
[46:20.560 --> 46:21.240]  I did.
[46:22.320 --> 46:22.900]  That's why it's
[46:22.900 --> 46:23.480]  like MAGA
[46:23.480 --> 46:24.420]  stream over there.
[46:24.420 --> 46:25.420]  I always get a
[46:25.420 --> 46:26.560]  MAGA stream with
[46:26.560 --> 46:27.340]  Blizz and BK.
[46:27.420 --> 46:28.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[46:28.460 --> 46:29.380]  It's going really
[46:29.380 --> 46:29.800]  really well.
[46:29.840 --> 46:30.460]  It's confusing.
[46:30.620 --> 46:31.260]  Your tiger's
[46:31.260 --> 46:32.000]  falling off there.
[46:32.400 --> 46:33.340]  It's Raja.
[46:33.720 --> 46:34.260]  Thank you.
[46:34.360 --> 46:35.420]  And it's a cutie cuff.
[46:36.280 --> 46:37.100]  Raja from
[46:37.100 --> 46:37.540]  Aladdin?
[46:37.840 --> 46:38.080]  Yeah.
[46:38.720 --> 46:39.680]  I've been trying to
[46:39.680 --> 46:40.600]  get Dumbo and
[46:40.600 --> 46:42.140]  Marie but I only have
[46:42.140 --> 46:43.280]  Raja and I have
[46:43.280 --> 46:44.580]  this guy.
[46:44.900 --> 46:45.800]  Big Hero 7.
[46:45.920 --> 46:46.760]  And I have Rafiki.
[46:46.920 --> 46:47.240]  I have another
[46:47.240 --> 46:47.500]  Raja.
[46:47.500 --> 46:48.080]  Are these like
[46:48.080 --> 46:48.700]  blind boxes or
[46:48.700 --> 46:48.900]  something?
[46:49.000 --> 46:49.440]  Yeah, they're blind
[46:49.440 --> 46:49.600]  boxes.
[46:49.600 --> 46:49.980]  Yeah, they're
[46:50.420 --> 46:51.720]  called cutie
[46:51.720 --> 46:51.960]  cuffs.
[46:52.640 --> 46:53.640]  And Geoff opens
[46:53.640 --> 46:54.020]  them for me
[46:54.020 --> 46:54.340]  sometimes.
[46:54.680 --> 46:55.320]  I see those at
[46:55.320 --> 46:55.620]  Target.
[46:55.720 --> 46:56.460]  Those are next to
[46:56.460 --> 46:57.500]  the Shang-Chi cards
[46:57.500 --> 46:57.980]  that are never
[46:57.980 --> 46:58.400]  purchased.
[47:00.300 --> 47:01.320]  I finally bought
[47:01.320 --> 47:01.980]  some Loki cards
[47:01.980 --> 47:02.480]  just because I felt
[47:02.480 --> 47:03.040]  bad that they were
[47:03.040 --> 47:03.760]  there for so long.
[47:03.800 --> 47:04.280]  How were they?
[47:04.760 --> 47:05.160]  Nothing.
[47:05.360 --> 47:05.720]  They were nothing.
[47:06.400 --> 47:07.260]  Have we gotten
[47:07.260 --> 47:08.440]  anything that's like
[47:08.440 --> 47:09.340]  a good hit?
[47:09.480 --> 47:09.840]  I don't know.
[47:09.860 --> 47:10.140]  I've just been
[47:10.140 --> 47:10.500]  listening to you.
[47:10.500 --> 47:11.560]  I tried to open
[47:12.220 --> 47:13.180]  that thing and Geoff
[47:13.180 --> 47:13.960]  got mad at me.
[47:15.120 --> 47:15.800]  No, we haven't
[47:15.800 --> 47:16.480]  really got anything.
[47:16.660 --> 47:17.120]  Got a mem
[47:17.120 --> 47:17.520]  card.
[47:18.280 --> 47:18.880]  All right.
[47:19.300 --> 47:20.400]  I can see I'm
[47:20.400 --> 47:21.140]  upsetting Geoffrey,
[47:21.340 --> 47:22.100]  so I'll leave.
[47:22.880 --> 47:23.480]  I guess.
[47:23.580 --> 47:24.040]  Geoffrey is upset.
[47:24.880 --> 47:25.320]  He's upset.
[47:25.380 --> 47:26.220]  You can tell I'm in
[47:26.220 --> 47:26.800]  trouble when he uses
[47:26.800 --> 47:27.420]  my full name.
[47:28.180 --> 47:29.200]  Am I the only person
[47:29.200 --> 47:29.780]  who uses your full
[47:29.780 --> 47:29.980]  name?
[47:30.060 --> 47:30.400]  That's how I know.
[47:30.420 --> 47:31.060]  It's a sign of respect.
[47:31.060 --> 47:31.700]  You and my mom.
[47:31.920 --> 47:32.760]  I respect my elders,
[47:32.960 --> 47:33.760]  so I gotta use your
[47:33.760 --> 47:34.200]  full name.
[47:34.520 --> 47:35.460]  I love you, Jack.
[47:35.540 --> 47:36.420]  Love you, Geoffrey.
[47:36.660 --> 47:37.300]  Love you, Emily.
[47:37.580 --> 47:38.100]  As soon as this
[47:39.260 --> 47:39.920]  breaks us over,
[47:40.020 --> 47:41.980]  please go over to
[47:41.980 --> 47:43.100]  Twitch.tv
[47:43.100 --> 47:43.940]  slash Rooster Teeth.
[47:44.180 --> 47:44.660]  Twitch.tv slash Rooster Teeth.
[47:44.740 --> 47:45.420]  The best place.
[47:45.540 --> 47:46.260]  Inside Gaming.
[47:46.440 --> 47:47.180]  It's the best place.
[47:47.180 --> 47:48.400]  Twitch.tv slash Rooster Teeth.
[47:48.500 --> 47:48.940]  Go there.
[47:49.040 --> 47:49.680]  It's the best place.
[47:49.700 --> 47:50.640]  And watch us play Uno
[47:50.640 --> 47:51.700]  and watch us suffer.
[47:52.920 --> 47:53.800]  Gavin Williams?
[47:54.240 --> 47:57.310]  Sleep on it.
[48:00.030 --> 48:00.470]  Yeah.
[48:01.470 --> 48:02.710]  Someone asked why the
[48:02.710 --> 48:03.650]  book talk is obsessed
[48:03.650 --> 48:05.110]  with hooky, hooky?
[48:05.250 --> 48:05.650]  Hockey?
[48:06.490 --> 48:07.670]  And we do, we cover
[48:07.670 --> 48:08.350]  that, I think, in the
[48:08.350 --> 48:09.390]  Pucking Around episode
[48:09.390 --> 48:10.370]  about how someone had
[48:10.370 --> 48:11.250]  to get banned from it.
[48:11.310 --> 48:11.810]  Hold on, I'm gonna
[48:11.810 --> 48:12.250]  wait and make sure
[48:12.250 --> 48:12.870]  there's nobody else
[48:12.870 --> 48:13.810]  that has a failing
[48:13.810 --> 48:14.690]  production that needs
[48:14.690 --> 48:15.530]  to get screen time.
[48:16.550 --> 48:16.910]  Nope, we're good.
[48:16.970 --> 48:17.130]  Okay.
[48:17.330 --> 48:17.850]  You were saying?
[48:18.150 --> 48:18.810]  Back to my failing
[48:18.810 --> 48:19.430]  production that needs
[48:19.430 --> 48:20.190]  to get screen time.
[48:20.390 --> 48:20.770]  I was talking about
[48:20.770 --> 48:21.410]  clutch my pearls.
[48:21.770 --> 48:22.050]  Okay.
[48:23.550 --> 48:24.690]  That was Jack, everybody.
[48:24.950 --> 48:25.570]  One of my best friends,
[48:25.770 --> 48:25.990]  Jack.
[48:26.570 --> 48:27.470]  It's such a shame
[48:27.470 --> 48:28.750]  that they stream at the
[48:28.750 --> 48:30.070]  same time that you do
[48:30.070 --> 48:30.630]  this show.
[48:30.770 --> 48:31.310]  Isn't that crazy?
[48:31.670 --> 48:32.590]  I know, it is crazy
[48:32.590 --> 48:33.190]  because then he can
[48:33.190 --> 48:34.010]  never be on.
[48:34.290 --> 48:35.310]  Unless he's derelict
[48:36.450 --> 48:37.450]  of his own duty.
[48:39.090 --> 48:39.890]  I don't know.
[48:41.750 --> 48:42.830]  Oh boy, we didn't
[48:42.830 --> 48:43.450]  even get to the good
[48:43.450 --> 48:43.790]  cards yet.
[48:43.790 --> 48:44.930]  We only have 10 minutes
[48:44.930 --> 48:45.210]  to go.
[48:45.310 --> 48:45.770]  We're barely going to
[48:45.770 --> 48:46.190]  get through all this
[48:46.190 --> 48:46.910]  retail crap.
[48:48.570 --> 48:49.610]  You had the time slot
[48:49.610 --> 48:49.930]  first.
[48:49.990 --> 48:50.450]  It's true.
[48:50.730 --> 48:52.170]  Yeah, that's what
[48:52.170 --> 48:53.530]  helped you figure out
[48:53.530 --> 48:54.390]  when your time slot
[48:54.390 --> 48:54.850]  should be.
[48:56.950 --> 48:57.890]  All right, so there
[48:57.890 --> 48:58.070]  we go.
[48:58.190 --> 48:58.650]  That's the end.
[48:58.790 --> 48:59.370]  Oh no, sorry.
[48:59.450 --> 49:00.050]  One more pack.
[49:00.310 --> 49:00.890]  So we actually got a
[49:00.890 --> 49:01.630]  relic out of this box.
[49:01.830 --> 49:02.310]  Which is something,
[49:02.410 --> 49:02.590]  yeah.
[49:02.750 --> 49:03.390]  You sleeved it.
[49:03.630 --> 49:03.930]  I did.
[49:06.470 --> 49:07.190]  There's a...
[49:07.190 --> 49:08.130]  I'm not in here.
[49:09.290 --> 49:09.750]  Yeah, it is.
[49:10.250 --> 49:11.430]  Major League Material,
[49:11.430 --> 49:12.790]  Joe Ryan from the
[49:12.790 --> 49:13.810]  Minnesota Twins.
[49:14.710 --> 49:15.570]  Ooh, this is one that
[49:15.570 --> 49:16.110]  you can pick a game.
[49:16.290 --> 49:17.250]  You gotta register for this.
[49:17.250 --> 49:17.850]  I've given you like
[49:17.850 --> 49:18.350]  five of those.
[49:19.570 --> 49:20.470]  Okay, first of all,
[49:20.550 --> 49:22.090]  I told you at the
[49:22.090 --> 49:23.290]  beginning, I'm not
[49:23.290 --> 49:24.030]  paying attention.
[49:27.890 --> 49:28.970]  Although I do want to
[49:28.970 --> 49:29.770]  be here and I am
[49:29.770 --> 49:30.270]  interested.
[49:31.190 --> 49:32.050]  I don't know a lot
[49:32.050 --> 49:32.890]  about baseball and
[49:32.890 --> 49:33.910]  there's so many people.
[49:34.250 --> 49:35.630]  It's hard for me to...
[49:36.050 --> 49:36.570]  Me too.
[49:36.950 --> 49:37.450]  You know what we found
[49:37.450 --> 49:38.150]  out though the other day?
[49:38.190 --> 49:38.810]  We found out that there's
[49:38.810 --> 49:39.530]  more people in football
[49:39.530 --> 49:40.030]  than baseball.
[49:40.290 --> 49:40.610]  Yeah.
[49:40.850 --> 49:41.770]  We didn't know that.
[49:42.090 --> 49:42.550]  What's that?
[49:42.670 --> 49:43.510]  Alright, so this is a
[49:43.510 --> 49:43.890]  hobby.
[49:44.090 --> 49:44.290]  Okay.
[49:44.470 --> 49:45.090]  We're down to the last
[49:45.090 --> 49:45.610]  ten minutes.
[49:46.310 --> 49:47.070]  I just went and had
[49:47.070 --> 49:47.830]  lunch with Jack the other
[49:47.830 --> 49:47.970]  day.
[49:48.010 --> 49:48.710]  It's lovely to see him.
[49:49.310 --> 49:50.070]  I know I give him a hard
[49:50.070 --> 49:50.890]  time but I do love Jack.
[49:52.530 --> 49:53.910]  And so in the hobby box
[49:53.910 --> 49:54.830]  you get...
[49:54.830 --> 49:55.450]  On the regular hobby
[49:55.450 --> 49:55.990]  box you get one of
[49:55.990 --> 49:56.830]  these exclusive blue
[49:56.830 --> 49:59.310]  packs with four special
[49:59.310 --> 49:59.810]  cards in it.
[49:59.910 --> 50:02.370]  In the final box we're
[50:02.370 --> 50:02.950]  gonna open, which I
[50:02.950 --> 50:03.510]  guess we'll open next
[50:03.510 --> 50:04.450]  week, this is the
[50:04.450 --> 50:05.110]  mega box.
[50:05.370 --> 50:06.150]  They'll have two of
[50:06.150 --> 50:06.590]  those packs.
[50:07.130 --> 50:07.950]  And you're supposed to
[50:07.950 --> 50:09.030]  open this last.
[50:09.310 --> 50:09.710]  Uh-huh.
[50:10.170 --> 50:11.350]  But I've never been good
[50:11.350 --> 50:12.270]  at being patient like
[50:12.270 --> 50:12.490]  that.
[50:12.550 --> 50:13.230]  No, open it now.
[50:13.490 --> 50:14.210]  We'll open this one
[50:14.210 --> 50:14.230]  first.
[50:14.230 --> 50:14.690]  It's like our rip card.
[50:14.910 --> 50:15.670]  Yeah, this is like our
[50:15.670 --> 50:16.470]  extra special.
[50:16.750 --> 50:17.210]  What do you want?
[50:17.250 --> 50:17.630]  What do you want the
[50:17.630 --> 50:17.870]  most?
[50:19.050 --> 50:20.250]  I want an Ellie
[50:20.250 --> 50:20.670]  Dela Cruz.
[50:20.890 --> 50:21.050]  Okay.
[50:21.090 --> 50:21.350]  Parallel.
[50:21.610 --> 50:22.050]  Okay, rookie.
[50:22.850 --> 50:23.510]  Alright, we got
[50:24.130 --> 50:24.450]  Madelson.
[50:25.490 --> 50:25.810]  Gorgeous.
[50:26.370 --> 50:29.350]  See, in Panini I
[50:29.350 --> 50:29.890]  believe this would be
[50:29.890 --> 50:30.970]  called a mojo refractor.
[50:31.010 --> 50:31.490]  I don't know what they
[50:31.490 --> 50:31.850]  call it here.
[50:31.890 --> 50:32.390]  We got a Corbin
[50:32.390 --> 50:33.290]  Carroll rookie cup.
[50:33.430 --> 50:33.950]  That's nice.
[50:33.950 --> 50:34.910]  These are all so pretty.
[50:35.050 --> 50:35.410]  Yeah, they're very
[50:35.410 --> 50:35.830]  pretty.
[50:36.870 --> 50:37.230]  Nice.
[50:37.550 --> 50:38.610]  Is that the same kind
[50:38.610 --> 50:39.330]  of pattern?
[50:39.550 --> 50:40.070]  Yeah, it's the exact
[50:40.070 --> 50:40.630]  same pattern on all
[50:40.630 --> 50:40.850]  four.
[50:41.030 --> 50:41.170]  Okay.
[50:41.410 --> 50:42.930]  Garrett, Cole, and
[50:42.930 --> 50:43.610]  then Bryce Harper.
[50:43.870 --> 50:44.870]  So, unfortunately
[50:44.870 --> 50:46.950]  nothing crazy, but
[50:46.950 --> 50:48.330]  the Corbin Carroll is
[50:48.330 --> 50:48.550]  alright.
[50:48.650 --> 50:49.050]  We can go ahead and
[50:49.050 --> 50:49.490]  just leave those
[50:49.490 --> 50:49.850]  though, please.
[50:49.890 --> 50:50.010]  Okay.
[50:50.590 --> 50:51.050]  And then we'll
[50:51.050 --> 50:51.710]  definitely get an,
[50:52.290 --> 50:53.010]  we'll just open these
[50:53.010 --> 50:54.570]  till the timer's out,
[50:54.610 --> 50:55.550]  but we'll get an
[50:55.550 --> 50:56.930]  autograph or a
[50:56.930 --> 50:57.510]  mem card in here.
[50:57.510 --> 50:58.310]  Hopefully it's not a
[50:58.310 --> 50:59.090]  dog-shit mem card.
[50:59.170 --> 50:59.590]  It's an autograph.
[51:00.890 --> 51:01.470]  Uh, J-Rod.
[51:02.450 --> 51:03.510]  Anne, I will go
[51:03.510 --> 51:04.170]  through all these at
[51:04.170 --> 51:05.010]  home and see if I
[51:05.010 --> 51:05.950]  missed any, like,
[51:06.030 --> 51:06.670]  short prints or
[51:06.670 --> 51:06.970]  anything.
[51:08.650 --> 51:09.490]  King Griffey Jr.,
[51:09.490 --> 51:10.070]  that's nice.
[51:10.310 --> 51:11.630]  What if these, how
[51:11.630 --> 51:12.190]  you want to build a
[51:12.190 --> 51:12.730]  house out of the
[51:12.730 --> 51:14.030]  boxes, what if you
[51:14.030 --> 51:15.230]  do all of the
[51:15.230 --> 51:16.110]  blueprints, like,
[51:16.150 --> 51:16.790]  laid out on a
[51:16.790 --> 51:18.410]  table, like, as if
[51:18.410 --> 51:19.810]  it's your typical
[51:19.810 --> 51:20.530]  house blueprint on
[51:20.910 --> 51:21.270]  a...
[51:21.270 --> 51:22.290]  Could do that.
[51:22.330 --> 51:22.890]  Yordan Alvarez,
[51:23.010 --> 51:23.650]  that's nice.
[51:26.350 --> 51:27.070]  We can do this
[51:27.070 --> 51:27.310]  week.
[51:30.190 --> 51:30.850]  Got a couple
[51:30.850 --> 51:31.710]  fuck faces to
[51:31.710 --> 51:32.310]  record.
[51:32.830 --> 51:33.190]  Uh-huh.
[51:33.270 --> 51:34.130]  Got some let's
[51:34.130 --> 51:35.790]  plays to record.
[51:36.670 --> 51:37.550]  It's nice hearing you
[51:37.550 --> 51:38.430]  do your let's plays,
[51:38.630 --> 51:39.970]  like, just laughing
[51:39.970 --> 51:41.090]  in the other room.
[51:41.090 --> 51:41.750]  It's so cute.
[51:42.290 --> 51:42.850]  They're a lot of
[51:42.850 --> 51:43.190]  fun to do.
[51:43.250 --> 51:43.690]  I've really been
[51:43.690 --> 51:44.430]  enjoying doing them
[51:44.430 --> 51:44.750]  again.
[51:44.930 --> 51:45.530]  You're back into
[51:45.530 --> 51:45.970]  the games.
[51:46.170 --> 51:46.910]  We started playing
[51:46.910 --> 51:48.010]  this game recently.
[51:48.270 --> 51:48.630]  There's not
[51:48.630 --> 51:49.190]  dog-shit in that
[51:49.190 --> 51:49.350]  pack.
[51:49.710 --> 51:50.110]  We started playing
[51:50.110 --> 51:50.810]  this game recently
[51:50.810 --> 51:51.810]  called Turbo...
[51:52.770 --> 51:53.570]  Ultra Turbo
[51:53.570 --> 51:54.330]  Golf, maybe?
[51:55.050 --> 51:55.550]  It's like Rocket
[51:55.550 --> 51:56.530]  League and golf
[51:56.530 --> 51:57.090]  had a baby.
[51:57.270 --> 51:58.290]  It's really fun.
[51:58.390 --> 51:59.030]  We've done a bunch
[51:59.030 --> 52:00.410]  of videos in that
[52:00.410 --> 52:00.770]  last week.
[52:00.950 --> 52:01.230]  Uh-huh.
[52:02.210 --> 52:02.910]  Looking forward to
[52:02.910 --> 52:03.550]  those coming out.
[52:04.090 --> 52:04.650]  Jazz Chisholm,
[52:04.710 --> 52:05.230]  best in baseball.
[52:05.630 --> 52:06.150]  Sean Gray,
[52:06.290 --> 52:06.910]  Daniel Polencia,
[52:07.070 --> 52:07.790]  Mackenzie Gore,
[52:07.990 --> 52:08.790]  Jared Triolo,
[52:09.130 --> 52:09.450]  Harold Okudomo.
[52:09.450 --> 52:10.070]  We ate at a
[52:10.070 --> 52:11.110]  custard place last
[52:11.110 --> 52:11.370]  night.
[52:11.450 --> 52:11.830]  We did.
[52:11.850 --> 52:12.450]  We ate at two
[52:12.450 --> 52:13.370]  separate custard
[52:13.370 --> 52:14.450]  places last night.
[52:14.650 --> 52:15.310]  You ever go to a
[52:15.310 --> 52:16.050]  custard place and
[52:16.050 --> 52:17.310]  then think, let's
[52:17.310 --> 52:17.730]  double down and do
[52:17.730 --> 52:18.030]  it again?
[52:18.310 --> 52:18.450]  Yeah.
[52:18.730 --> 52:19.350]  In one night.
[52:19.530 --> 52:20.070]  In one night.
[52:20.170 --> 52:20.870]  And we dined it.
[52:20.910 --> 52:21.470]  We went to, we
[52:21.470 --> 52:22.450]  tried this place
[52:22.450 --> 52:23.390]  called Freddy's.
[52:23.510 --> 52:23.750]  Yeah.
[52:24.430 --> 52:24.990]  Is it good?
[52:25.330 --> 52:26.990]  It was good.
[52:27.150 --> 52:27.810]  You don't like
[52:27.810 --> 52:28.610]  Freddy's or you love
[52:28.610 --> 52:28.750]  it?
[52:28.990 --> 52:29.390]  Yeah.
[52:30.590 --> 52:31.350]  That was good.
[52:31.530 --> 52:32.070]  It was real good.
[52:32.210 --> 52:32.850]  But we didn't get
[52:32.850 --> 52:33.530]  custard from there
[52:33.530 --> 52:34.170]  because we saw
[52:34.170 --> 52:34.770]  this place called
[52:34.770 --> 52:35.950]  Andy's Custard
[52:36.950 --> 52:38.430]  that was real good.
[52:39.790 --> 52:41.050]  And I got a,
[52:41.790 --> 52:42.630]  oh, what's that?
[52:42.730 --> 52:43.330]  Is that on-card?
[52:43.550 --> 52:44.290]  It's an on-card
[52:44.290 --> 52:45.290]  self-relic 35th
[52:48.670 --> 52:49.390]  anniversary auto
[52:49.810 --> 52:50.170]  rookie.
[52:50.310 --> 52:50.430]  hit?
[52:50.510 --> 52:51.730]  I don't know what
[52:51.730 --> 52:52.910]  this is worth, but it
[52:52.910 --> 52:55.950]  might be worth
[52:55.950 --> 52:56.350]  something.
[52:56.570 --> 52:56.850]  Okay.
[52:57.330 --> 52:58.130]  Let's put that in
[52:58.130 --> 53:00.250]  a, I'll find one
[53:00.250 --> 53:00.530]  for you.
[53:01.930 --> 53:02.870]  Anyway, you were
[53:02.870 --> 53:03.530]  saying about the...
[53:03.530 --> 53:04.010]  I don't know, I was
[53:04.010 --> 53:04.870]  just talking to talk.
[53:05.110 --> 53:07.030]  We had these
[53:07.030 --> 53:07.350]  things called
[53:07.350 --> 53:07.950]  concretes.
[53:07.990 --> 53:08.150]  You ever had
[53:08.150 --> 53:08.650]  a concrete?
[53:09.130 --> 53:09.710]  It's like a
[53:09.710 --> 53:10.630]  blizzard, I guess,
[53:10.710 --> 53:11.090]  kind of.
[53:11.170 --> 53:11.710]  But then I got
[53:11.710 --> 53:12.770]  mine jackhammered.
[53:13.270 --> 53:14.130]  Which means I
[53:14.130 --> 53:14.270]  found a
[53:14.270 --> 53:14.610]  jackhammer.
[53:14.910 --> 53:15.590]  But caramel in
[53:15.590 --> 53:16.730]  the middle, it was
[53:16.730 --> 53:17.050]  a lot.
[53:17.290 --> 53:17.850]  Yeah, they had weird,
[53:17.990 --> 53:18.310]  it was a weird
[53:18.310 --> 53:19.470]  naming scheme.
[53:19.650 --> 53:20.650]  I had a boot boy.
[53:20.930 --> 53:21.750]  When I was
[53:21.750 --> 53:22.890]  growing up, a boot
[53:22.890 --> 53:23.990]  boy was a name for
[53:23.990 --> 53:24.970]  a racist, aggressive
[53:24.970 --> 53:25.490]  skinhead.
[53:25.810 --> 53:27.510]  So I thought that
[53:27.510 --> 53:28.250]  was an odd thing to
[53:28.250 --> 53:28.870]  name a...
[53:28.870 --> 53:29.550]  It was hard to...
[53:29.550 --> 53:30.190]  You tried to stay
[53:30.190 --> 53:30.770]  away from the boot
[53:30.770 --> 53:31.010]  boys.
[53:31.170 --> 53:31.810]  It was hard to
[53:31.810 --> 53:32.730]  order because you'd
[53:32.730 --> 53:33.470]  have to be like,
[53:33.750 --> 53:34.630]  can I get a
[53:34.630 --> 53:35.750]  James Brownie,
[53:36.230 --> 53:37.210]  like, whatever.
[53:37.650 --> 53:38.290]  It's hard to say
[53:38.290 --> 53:38.830]  it seriously.
[53:43.630 --> 53:44.350]  Anything else?
[53:44.350 --> 53:45.090]  Let's leave this
[53:45.090 --> 53:45.470]  guy.
[53:46.190 --> 53:46.910]  Do you want to open
[53:46.910 --> 53:47.270]  up one more
[53:47.270 --> 53:47.730]  kitty cuff?
[53:47.890 --> 53:48.150]  Yes.
[53:50.170 --> 53:50.610]  Yes.
[53:50.670 --> 53:51.530]  All right, let me
[53:51.530 --> 53:51.990]  just get through
[53:51.990 --> 53:52.830]  this pack.
[53:53.790 --> 53:54.390]  What's that?
[53:55.410 --> 53:56.250]  Oh no, how come...
[53:56.250 --> 53:57.630]  They missed our...
[53:57.630 --> 53:58.050]  Oh, is it still
[53:58.050 --> 53:58.230]  down?
[54:01.130 --> 54:02.030]  I can talk more
[54:02.030 --> 54:02.810]  about custard.
[54:03.910 --> 54:04.390]  What happened?
[54:06.570 --> 54:07.330]  It's probably
[54:07.330 --> 54:08.950]  the people, the
[54:08.950 --> 54:09.750]  other streamers.
[54:10.570 --> 54:11.450]  They poisoned
[54:11.450 --> 54:11.750]  us.
[54:11.790 --> 54:12.770]  They came in
[54:12.770 --> 54:13.010]  here.
[54:13.490 --> 54:14.030]  They left
[54:14.030 --> 54:14.730]  something that
[54:14.730 --> 54:15.110]  like, is
[54:15.110 --> 54:15.790]  disgusting.
[54:15.790 --> 54:16.390]  Disabling the
[54:16.390 --> 54:16.770]  system.
[54:17.050 --> 54:17.470]  Oh, is that what
[54:17.470 --> 54:17.730]  they did?
[54:17.770 --> 54:18.170]  They came in
[54:18.170 --> 54:18.570]  and they set
[54:18.570 --> 54:19.130]  off like a
[54:19.130 --> 54:19.770]  tech bomb?
[54:19.990 --> 54:20.390]  Yeah.
[54:22.810 --> 54:23.830]  That's a real
[54:23.830 --> 54:24.690]  terrorist attack.
[54:24.830 --> 54:25.330]  Check on the
[54:25.330 --> 54:26.050]  CO2 in this
[54:26.050 --> 54:26.250]  room.
[54:26.390 --> 54:26.710]  Something's
[54:26.710 --> 54:27.010]  wrong.
[54:27.590 --> 54:28.310]  Tell Andrew
[54:28.310 --> 54:28.630]  to stop
[54:28.630 --> 54:28.990]  printing the
[54:28.990 --> 54:29.270]  law.
[54:29.590 --> 54:30.150]  Oh my God.
[54:34.250 --> 54:35.050]  What if the
[54:35.910 --> 54:36.310]  Russians...
[54:37.130 --> 54:37.730]  Is their
[54:37.730 --> 54:38.470]  stream down too?
[54:40.070 --> 54:40.790]  Can we take it
[54:40.790 --> 54:40.990]  down?
[54:44.050 --> 54:44.670]  I'll do it.
[54:44.890 --> 54:45.290]  I'll unplug
[54:51.120 --> 54:51.520]  it.
[54:51.520 --> 54:51.920]  So we're not
[54:51.920 --> 54:53.500]  live right now.
[54:53.560 --> 54:53.880]  But we're
[54:53.880 --> 54:54.240]  recording?
[54:56.280 --> 54:56.680]  Corey
[54:57.120 --> 54:57.520]  Singer.
[54:59.760 --> 55:00.320]  Let's see
[55:00.320 --> 55:00.820]  that.
[55:02.060 --> 55:02.740]  Which jersey
[55:02.740 --> 55:03.060]  is your
[55:03.060 --> 55:03.320]  favorite?
[55:04.520 --> 55:04.820]  Oh, look
[55:04.820 --> 55:05.020]  at that
[55:05.020 --> 55:05.320]  five.
[55:06.640 --> 55:06.980]  It's pretty
[55:06.980 --> 55:07.180]  cool.
[55:11.220 --> 55:11.900]  Is this in
[55:11.900 --> 55:12.460]  the recording
[55:12.460 --> 55:13.320]  of us just
[55:13.320 --> 55:14.380]  sitting silently?
[55:15.100 --> 55:15.660]  Yeah, this is
[55:15.660 --> 55:16.040]  all being
[55:16.040 --> 55:16.180]  recorded.
[55:16.180 --> 55:16.680]  So this is
[55:16.680 --> 55:16.920]  what it's
[55:16.920 --> 55:17.480]  really like at
[55:17.480 --> 55:17.720]  home.
[55:19.400 --> 55:20.180]  Of me going,
[55:20.180 --> 55:20.840]  oh, wow,
[55:20.960 --> 55:21.300]  neat.
[55:25.300 --> 55:25.620]  Sitting
[55:25.620 --> 55:26.080]  quietly.
[55:26.300 --> 55:26.820]  I'm not
[55:26.820 --> 55:27.200]  going to stop
[55:27.200 --> 55:27.680]  opening, Corey.
[55:28.200 --> 55:28.520]  Disassociating
[55:28.520 --> 55:29.260]  after we get
[55:29.260 --> 55:29.600]  back from
[55:29.600 --> 55:29.900]  Target.
[55:30.480 --> 55:30.900]  I just have
[55:30.900 --> 55:31.200]  five more
[55:31.200 --> 55:31.380]  minutes.
[55:31.440 --> 55:31.680]  I want to get
[55:31.680 --> 55:31.900]  through this
[55:31.900 --> 55:32.160]  box.
[55:32.240 --> 55:32.500]  And the next
[55:32.500 --> 55:32.940]  week we only
[55:32.940 --> 55:33.360]  have to do
[55:33.360 --> 55:34.300]  the Jumbo
[55:34.300 --> 55:34.860]  Mega, which
[55:34.860 --> 55:35.200]  is the
[55:35.200 --> 55:35.660]  good stuff.
[55:40.380 --> 55:40.820]  Yeah, we
[55:40.820 --> 55:41.220]  need to try
[55:41.220 --> 55:41.640]  Freddy's
[55:41.640 --> 55:42.020]  Custard.
[55:42.100 --> 55:42.520]  Do you get
[55:42.520 --> 55:42.800]  it in the
[55:42.800 --> 55:43.300]  cone or do you
[55:43.300 --> 55:43.620]  get it in the
[55:43.620 --> 55:43.920]  cup?
[55:44.180 --> 55:44.620]  And what
[55:44.620 --> 55:45.160]  flavor do you
[55:45.160 --> 55:45.380]  get?
[55:49.140 --> 55:49.580]  Right.
[55:52.420 --> 55:53.220]  Just a cone,
[55:53.340 --> 55:53.580]  driving.
[55:56.840 --> 55:57.700]  Oh, nice.
[55:58.200 --> 55:58.800]  Do they just
[55:58.800 --> 55:59.260]  have vanilla
[55:59.260 --> 55:59.880]  and chocolate?
[56:02.480 --> 56:02.900]  I feel like
[56:02.900 --> 56:03.020]  they would
[56:03.580 --> 56:04.020]  have...
[56:04.020 --> 56:04.520]  Yeah, well,
[56:05.180 --> 56:05.900]  up in
[56:05.900 --> 56:06.480]  Pflugerville,
[56:06.480 --> 56:06.880]  we went to
[56:06.880 --> 56:07.420]  that one.
[56:12.380 --> 56:12.820]  Pflugerville
[56:12.820 --> 56:13.260]  and Cedar
[56:13.260 --> 56:13.700]  Park is
[56:13.700 --> 56:13.940]  the one
[56:13.940 --> 56:14.480]  we went
[56:14.480 --> 56:14.920]  to.
[56:14.920 --> 56:15.880]  So, we had
[56:15.880 --> 56:16.280]  to do a road
[56:16.280 --> 56:16.940]  trip to it.
[56:17.520 --> 56:17.860]  And then,
[56:19.480 --> 56:20.020]  there's probably
[56:20.020 --> 56:20.340]  one down
[56:20.340 --> 56:20.940]  south, too.
[56:21.140 --> 56:21.540]  But yeah, we
[56:21.540 --> 56:22.300]  drove out of
[56:22.300 --> 56:22.960]  our way to
[56:22.960 --> 56:23.760]  experience these
[56:23.760 --> 56:23.940]  things.
[56:23.960 --> 56:24.280]  We had to
[56:24.280 --> 56:24.620]  make an
[56:24.620 --> 56:25.260]  attempt to
[56:25.260 --> 56:25.580]  get there.
[56:25.740 --> 56:25.960]  Yeah.
[56:26.440 --> 56:26.900]  And we
[56:26.900 --> 56:27.380]  dined in.
[56:28.620 --> 56:28.940]  It was a
[56:28.940 --> 56:29.080]  nice
[56:29.080 --> 56:29.480]  establishment.
[56:30.620 --> 56:30.920]  Yeah, I
[56:30.920 --> 56:31.160]  learned all
[56:31.160 --> 56:31.580]  about Freddy
[56:31.580 --> 56:31.900]  from the
[56:31.900 --> 56:32.280]  pictures on
[56:32.280 --> 56:32.540]  the wall.
[56:32.660 --> 56:32.940]  Freddy and
[56:32.940 --> 56:33.320]  I were both
[56:33.320 --> 56:33.660]  in the first
[56:33.660 --> 56:34.260]  Calvary Division.
[56:35.060 --> 56:35.500]  What were some
[56:35.500 --> 56:36.240]  other fun facts?
[56:36.320 --> 56:36.800]  You were giving us
[56:36.800 --> 56:37.360]  some last night.
[56:37.420 --> 56:37.720]  Oh, yeah.
[56:37.740 --> 56:38.200]  He raised
[56:38.200 --> 56:39.540]  chickens when
[56:39.540 --> 56:40.000]  he was a young
[56:40.000 --> 56:40.280]  boy.
[56:40.600 --> 56:40.860]  Yeah.
[56:41.660 --> 56:42.200]  That's about
[56:42.200 --> 56:42.640]  all I got.
[56:42.880 --> 56:43.320]  The little
[56:43.780 --> 56:44.500]  picture that was
[56:44.500 --> 56:45.180]  at our table
[56:45.180 --> 56:46.320]  said that he
[56:46.320 --> 56:47.240]  always asked
[56:47.240 --> 56:47.780]  people what
[56:47.780 --> 56:48.340]  they liked.
[56:48.400 --> 56:48.740]  And he
[56:48.740 --> 56:49.220]  learned that
[56:49.220 --> 56:49.920]  people preferred
[56:49.920 --> 56:50.660]  custard over
[56:50.660 --> 56:51.680]  ice cream.
[56:53.340 --> 56:53.840]  One's made
[56:53.840 --> 56:54.860]  with eggs,
[56:54.860 --> 56:55.180]  maybe?
[56:55.660 --> 56:55.800]  Isn't
[56:55.800 --> 56:56.200]  ice cream
[56:56.200 --> 56:56.420]  made with
[56:56.420 --> 56:56.620]  eggs?
[56:57.280 --> 56:57.980]  I don't
[56:57.980 --> 56:58.280]  know.
[56:58.560 --> 56:58.960]  Let's see.
[57:01.400 --> 57:02.060]  Let's see.
[57:02.700 --> 57:03.180]  Custard.
[57:03.460 --> 57:03.640]  I bet
[57:03.640 --> 57:04.200]  Mike knows.
[57:05.340 --> 57:05.980]  Mike knows
[57:05.980 --> 57:06.200]  everything.
[57:06.380 --> 57:07.180]  There he is.
[57:07.280 --> 57:07.500]  There's
[57:07.500 --> 57:07.740]  God.
[57:08.700 --> 57:09.280]  What's the
[57:09.280 --> 57:09.720]  difference?
[57:10.700 --> 57:12.770]  I don't
[57:12.770 --> 57:13.010]  know.
[57:17.100 --> 57:17.580]  Okay.
[57:18.060 --> 57:18.640]  Ice cream
[57:19.220 --> 57:20.040]  is made
[57:20.040 --> 57:20.640]  from milk,
[57:20.840 --> 57:21.060]  cream,
[57:21.120 --> 57:21.400]  or a
[57:21.400 --> 57:21.720]  combination
[57:21.720 --> 57:22.160]  of the
[57:22.160 --> 57:22.420]  two.
[57:22.620 --> 57:22.940]  While
[57:22.940 --> 57:23.600]  frozen custard
[57:23.600 --> 57:23.940]  is made
[57:23.940 --> 57:24.460]  from milk,
[57:24.680 --> 57:24.820]  cream,
[57:24.980 --> 57:25.280]  and egg
[57:25.280 --> 57:25.580]  yolks.
[57:25.740 --> 57:26.320]  Ah, there you
[57:26.320 --> 57:26.580]  go.
[57:27.180 --> 57:27.700]  So when we
[57:27.700 --> 57:28.260]  tried to make
[57:28.260 --> 57:28.640]  ice cream,
[57:28.760 --> 57:28.940]  we made
[57:28.940 --> 57:29.220]  custard.
[57:29.300 --> 57:29.460]  And that's
[57:29.460 --> 57:29.720]  why it was
[57:29.720 --> 57:30.320]  probably pretty
[57:30.320 --> 57:30.580]  yucky.
[57:30.940 --> 57:31.180]  Yeah.
[57:31.440 --> 57:31.720]  Yeah.
[57:31.900 --> 57:32.280]  Alright, so
[57:32.280 --> 57:33.060]  I'm gonna start
[57:33.060 --> 57:33.920]  putting all
[57:33.920 --> 57:34.460]  these away.
[57:34.760 --> 57:35.060]  You still
[57:35.060 --> 57:35.420]  got that
[57:35.420 --> 57:35.680]  stuff?
[57:36.400 --> 57:36.780]  Yeah.
[57:36.780 --> 57:37.720]  Thank you.
[57:37.940 --> 57:38.400]  Yeah.
[57:40.120 --> 57:41.620]  Well, I guess
[57:41.620 --> 57:42.420]  this is all just
[57:42.420 --> 57:43.040]  gonna be a real
[57:43.040 --> 57:43.860]  quiet part of
[57:43.860 --> 57:45.000]  the video.
[57:45.320 --> 57:45.800]  Thanks for
[57:45.800 --> 57:46.540]  tuning in.
[57:47.260 --> 57:47.760]  This has been
[57:48.520 --> 57:49.040]  another
[57:50.080 --> 57:50.600]  riveting
[57:50.600 --> 57:51.380]  break show.
[57:51.780 --> 57:52.240]  I've really
[57:52.240 --> 57:52.960]  enjoyed spending
[57:52.960 --> 57:53.700]  the last hour
[57:53.700 --> 57:54.160]  with you.
[57:55.040 --> 57:56.160]  Eric, you were
[57:56.160 --> 57:56.860]  particularly
[57:57.500 --> 57:58.440]  enjoyable today.
[57:58.660 --> 57:59.200]  He was really
[57:59.200 --> 58:00.060]  popping off today.
[58:00.360 --> 58:00.640]  I really
[58:01.560 --> 58:02.080]  like...
[58:02.080 --> 58:02.860]  Look how tired
[58:02.860 --> 58:03.220]  he is.
[58:03.260 --> 58:03.720]  He's just been
[58:03.720 --> 58:04.800]  going so hard.
[58:04.800 --> 58:05.460]  Yeah, well,
[58:05.540 --> 58:06.120]  he's, you know,
[58:06.240 --> 58:07.080]  he's a busy guy.
[58:07.260 --> 58:07.560]  Yeah.
[58:08.540 --> 58:09.260]  He doesn't get
[58:09.260 --> 58:09.720]  enough credit.
[58:10.340 --> 58:10.640]  No.
[58:11.620 --> 58:12.560]  No, he doesn't.
[58:13.040 --> 58:13.380]  Are we still
[58:13.380 --> 58:13.660]  down?
[58:14.700 --> 58:15.500]  Do you think we're
[58:15.500 --> 58:16.180]  coming back up or
[58:16.180 --> 58:16.740]  are we just done?
[58:20.400 --> 58:20.820]  Okay.
[58:22.500 --> 58:23.140]  Alright, well,
[58:23.240 --> 58:23.820]  thanks for tuning
[58:23.820 --> 58:24.480]  in to another
[58:24.480 --> 58:25.220]  break show.
[58:26.020 --> 58:26.760]  This one was an
[58:26.760 --> 58:27.380]  interesting one.
[58:27.440 --> 58:28.080]  It had a lot of
[58:28.080 --> 58:29.120]  uninvited guests.
[58:30.360 --> 58:31.200]  Eric was...
[58:31.200 --> 58:31.760]  Eric was
[58:31.760 --> 58:32.500]  unusually
[58:33.400 --> 58:33.800]  easy
[58:33.800 --> 58:34.660]  to work with
[58:34.660 --> 58:35.640]  out of the blue.
[58:35.780 --> 58:36.700]  He really just went
[58:36.700 --> 58:37.300]  on and on about
[58:37.300 --> 58:38.100]  the Dodgers a lot
[58:38.100 --> 58:38.240]  though.
[58:38.320 --> 58:38.960]  I really enjoyed
[58:38.960 --> 58:39.940]  my time just
[58:39.940 --> 58:40.440]  like answering
[58:40.440 --> 58:41.120]  chat with the
[58:41.120 --> 58:41.480]  audience.
[58:42.420 --> 58:43.160]  Always a pleasure
[58:43.160 --> 58:44.000]  to see Griff.
[58:45.140 --> 58:45.800]  Everyone said
[58:45.800 --> 58:46.100]  egg.
[58:46.800 --> 58:47.180]  Did they just
[58:47.180 --> 58:48.340]  glitch out and all
[58:48.340 --> 58:49.120]  they hear is me
[58:49.120 --> 58:49.500]  talking about
[58:49.500 --> 58:49.940]  eggs with
[58:49.940 --> 58:50.420]  custard?
[58:53.460 --> 58:54.260]  How funny
[58:54.260 --> 58:54.700]  would that be?
[58:54.880 --> 58:55.160]  That would be
[58:55.160 --> 58:55.500]  amazing.
[58:56.100 --> 58:56.640]  I got a new
[58:56.640 --> 58:57.160]  Rajah.
[58:57.580 --> 58:58.000]  You got a new
[58:58.000 --> 58:58.360]  Rajah.
[58:58.440 --> 58:58.740]  I know you can
[58:58.740 --> 58:59.080]  trade.
[58:59.220 --> 58:59.980]  Still don't have a
[58:59.980 --> 59:00.220]  Marie.
[59:00.320 --> 59:01.020]  I'll trade two
[59:01.020 --> 59:02.080]  Rajahs for a
[59:02.080 --> 59:02.460]  Marie.
[59:04.460 --> 59:05.440]  Jack ripped up
[59:05.440 --> 59:06.760]  my card box for
[59:06.760 --> 59:07.520]  some reason.
[59:07.960 --> 59:09.680]  At least he didn't
[59:09.680 --> 59:10.040]  penetrate.
[59:10.640 --> 59:11.480]  I've heard that's a
[59:11.480 --> 59:12.180]  problem with him.
[59:14.760 --> 59:15.560]  Let's see.
[59:16.480 --> 59:17.320]  I guess that's
[59:17.320 --> 59:17.480]  it.
[59:17.560 --> 59:18.100]  Thanks for
[59:18.100 --> 59:18.720]  listening.
[59:19.920 --> 59:20.440]  Nobody's going to
[59:20.440 --> 59:21.300]  tell me to stop so
[59:21.300 --> 59:21.820]  I guess I'll tell
[59:21.820 --> 59:22.360]  myself to stop.
[59:22.680 --> 59:23.340]  We'll see you next
[59:23.340 --> 59:24.060]  week when we open
[59:24.060 --> 59:26.180]  up the big bag.
[59:27.760 --> 59:27.980]  All right,
[59:27.980 --> 59:28.300]  bye, bye, bye.
[59:28.300 --> 59:29.040]  Oh, no, here you
[59:29.040 --> 59:29.220]  come.
[59:32.230 --> 59:33.290]  Bye, good-bye,
[59:33.390 --> 59:33.890]  good-bye.
