[00:11.320 --> 00:20.120]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Ace Podcast.
[00:20.420 --> 00:20.780]  What?
[00:21.120 --> 00:21.860]  Break show.
[00:22.400 --> 00:23.300]  Getting ahead of myself.
[00:23.540 --> 00:25.440]  I was recording the podcast this week.
[00:25.520 --> 00:28.180]  I was thinking about it when I was driving over here and I was bummed.
[00:28.240 --> 00:30.340]  Because I was thinking about all the stuff that I can't talk about.
[00:30.360 --> 00:30.920]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[00:31.140 --> 00:31.640]  There's a lot.
[00:31.820 --> 00:33.340]  But that's not what this is.
[00:33.360 --> 00:34.300]  This is the break show.
[00:34.460 --> 00:35.440]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:35.560 --> 00:36.820]  His name is Jason Tatum.
[00:37.080 --> 00:37.780]  He's the best.
[00:37.780 --> 00:39.500]  My wife, Emily Hatfield.
[00:39.660 --> 00:39.780]  Hi.
[00:40.080 --> 00:42.080]  Eric Baudour, a producer extraordinaire.
[00:42.600 --> 00:43.460]  I know the dog's name.
[00:44.180 --> 00:44.720]  He... yeah.
[00:45.540 --> 00:45.900]  Yeah.
[00:46.100 --> 00:49.840]  You know, he says he knows the dog's name, but he's not told me the dog's name yet.
[00:50.240 --> 00:50.840]  Oh, wait, so you...
[00:51.420 --> 00:52.380]  I can say it right now.
[00:52.440 --> 00:53.160]  No, don't say it here.
[00:53.680 --> 00:54.280]  Don't say it here.
[00:54.600 --> 00:54.960]  Interesting.
[00:55.300 --> 00:55.860]  Oh, okay.
[00:56.300 --> 00:57.800]  I confirmed it with my wife, Anne Gracie.
[00:58.060 --> 00:58.440]  Oh, okay.
[00:58.460 --> 00:59.440]  He knows the dog's name, then.
[00:59.520 --> 00:59.860]  There you go.
[00:59.920 --> 01:00.220]  Hang on.
[01:00.320 --> 01:00.880]  Camera on me.
[01:01.600 --> 01:05.980]  Hey, guys, if you're watching this, don't forget to become a First Member.
[01:06.160 --> 01:06.960]  Shane, are you getting this?
[01:06.960 --> 01:08.880]  If you're watching this, don't forget to become a First Member.
[01:09.460 --> 01:11.160]  Your patronage helps us so much.
[01:11.600 --> 01:15.980]  And what I'm asking you is to go to fuckfacepod.com and become a First Member.
[01:16.280 --> 01:18.900]  Fuckfacepod.com slash sign up to become a First Member.
[01:19.080 --> 01:19.960]  Thank you so much.
[01:20.160 --> 01:21.000]  You can continue the show now.
[01:21.340 --> 01:22.100]  You know what you should do?
[01:22.280 --> 01:22.900]  What was that?
[01:23.920 --> 01:24.620]  That was really sincere.
[01:24.620 --> 01:25.500]  That was really nice.
[01:25.500 --> 01:26.160]  That was really sweet.
[01:26.280 --> 01:26.420]  He had a little smile.
[01:26.420 --> 01:27.040]  I really liked that.
[01:27.760 --> 01:31.880]  He was like, for pennies on the dollar, you too could support Fuckface.
[01:31.880 --> 01:33.160]  It was very Sally Struthers.
[01:33.260 --> 01:33.460]  Yeah.
[01:33.540 --> 01:33.820]  Yeah.
[01:34.120 --> 01:35.980]  Or, I'm sorry, that's maybe a dated reference.
[01:35.980 --> 01:38.700]  That's a very, no one who's watching this gets that.
[01:38.840 --> 01:40.440]  Very Sarah McLaughlin.
[01:40.560 --> 01:40.920]  Oh, nice.
[01:41.000 --> 01:41.120]  There you go.
[01:41.140 --> 01:41.740]  You know what you should do?
[01:41.820 --> 01:47.040]  Is that once, obviously once like Andrew and Gavin and Nick are the only ones that don't
[01:47.040 --> 01:47.500]  know the name.
[01:47.560 --> 01:47.980]  That's true.
[01:48.080 --> 01:48.240]  Yeah.
[01:48.420 --> 01:53.220]  So once they've figured out or whatever, before you tell the audience, you should tell your
[01:53.220 --> 01:54.100]  First Members first.
[01:54.820 --> 01:57.420]  Oh, a first perk is knowing the dog's name?
[01:57.580 --> 01:58.040]  First, first.
[01:58.380 --> 01:59.180]  Monetize the dog.
[01:59.280 --> 01:59.580]  No, no, no.
[01:59.800 --> 02:00.560]  Monetize the dog.
[02:00.800 --> 02:00.840]  No.
[02:01.320 --> 02:02.200]  Monetize the dog.
[02:02.660 --> 02:03.020]  Monetize.
[02:03.100 --> 02:03.460]  Monetize.
[02:03.460 --> 02:06.120]  We're not monetizing the dog.
[02:06.880 --> 02:08.540]  We're not selling information.
[02:08.940 --> 02:10.360]  I would sell my dog to Disney.
[02:11.400 --> 02:14.880]  And we'll sell him to you, First Members.
[02:15.120 --> 02:18.720]  Thank you so much for being a First Member and you can support this show by becoming
[02:18.720 --> 02:20.200]  a First Member and supporting us directly.
[02:21.100 --> 02:23.440]  Oh, look at how sweet he is.
[02:24.240 --> 02:25.360]  Gracie, you can go ahead and clip that out.
[02:25.420 --> 02:26.320]  I think it's the falcon.
[02:26.720 --> 02:27.440]  You know what?
[02:27.480 --> 02:29.820]  I think that when they clip it, it needs to be like...
[02:30.380 --> 02:32.560]  I think the shoulder falcon is just in my ear.
[02:32.560 --> 02:36.160]  He's saying, he's saying, tell them about becoming a First Member.
[02:36.460 --> 02:37.180]  You know what it is?
[02:37.220 --> 02:37.340]  What?
[02:37.420 --> 02:41.900]  Is that you don't have to have your hard exterior shell because you're protected by a falcon.
[02:41.900 --> 02:42.760]  I am, it's true.
[02:42.780 --> 02:43.260]  So you can be yourself.
[02:43.260 --> 02:44.140]  I can relax.
[02:44.360 --> 02:47.160]  You know what's pretty cool about that falcon while we're mentioning it?
[02:47.520 --> 02:49.340]  All this is all being filmed.
[02:49.580 --> 02:49.760]  Yeah.
[02:49.780 --> 02:50.460]  And that's fine.
[02:50.500 --> 02:51.120]  And that's fine.
[02:51.220 --> 02:53.560]  Because that is a 100% filmable falcon.
[02:53.560 --> 02:57.520]  I was talking to someone earlier and no one's going to get that until the episode comes
[02:57.520 --> 02:58.460]  out next week.
[02:58.460 --> 03:03.940]  The problem with the Face Universe is that we record this stuff in such a weird way that
[03:03.940 --> 03:07.660]  we're making inside jokes that you guys aren't going to get for a while.
[03:07.920 --> 03:08.860]  It's very exciting.
[03:09.220 --> 03:11.080]  I'm frankly very excited about it.
[03:11.140 --> 03:14.500]  It would be wild to go back and watch it canonically, all the clips that we have.
[03:14.640 --> 03:18.560]  Friday, the 16th, if you're watching this live or I guess the VOD of this because it
[03:18.560 --> 03:18.980]  comes out Thursday.
[03:19.820 --> 03:20.820]  Falcon goes on sale.
[03:21.220 --> 03:22.260]  Hat goes on sale.
[03:22.620 --> 03:23.760]  Bumper sticker goes on sale.
[03:23.860 --> 03:24.580]  Shirt goes on sale.
[03:24.720 --> 03:26.760]  Get protected by falcons.
[03:26.760 --> 03:31.020]  The bumper sticker says, and it's in the video that we're releasing tomorrow or whatever,
[03:31.440 --> 03:34.740]  is this car is protected by falcons and has the falcon on it.
[03:34.800 --> 03:34.960]  That's awesome.
[03:35.380 --> 03:35.800]  It rocks.
[03:36.360 --> 03:37.020]  It's so cool.
[03:37.200 --> 03:38.060]  Also, check this out.
[03:38.100 --> 03:38.360]  Watch this.
[03:38.440 --> 03:38.820]  Camera on me.
[03:38.940 --> 03:39.240]  Watch this.
[03:41.220 --> 03:42.500]  His hat comes off.
[03:42.820 --> 03:43.000]  Snakey.
[03:43.620 --> 03:44.380]  Well, now he can attack.
[03:44.400 --> 03:44.820]  Now he can see.
[03:44.880 --> 03:45.660]  Now he's in attack mode.
[03:46.280 --> 03:48.520]  Now he's in shmi mode.
[03:51.460 --> 03:53.300]  What if you named the dog Shmi?
[03:53.460 --> 03:54.700]  That would have been crazy.
[03:55.220 --> 03:55.300]  That would have been funny.
[03:56.320 --> 03:57.600]  I love that little falcon, though.
[03:57.720 --> 03:59.560]  I gotta say, we filmed a commercial on it earlier today.
[03:59.780 --> 04:01.420]  I think it might be the funniest thing we've done in a little while.
[04:02.280 --> 04:03.800]  I'm very, very happy about it.
[04:03.880 --> 04:04.740]  We'll release it.
[04:04.820 --> 04:06.260]  If you're watching this live, we'll release it tomorrow.
[04:06.500 --> 04:12.640]  We should put it on the baby's little harness so that when he's walking, he's got a little protected.
[04:13.240 --> 04:14.080]  That's a good idea.
[04:14.840 --> 04:15.640]  That's a good idea.
[04:15.720 --> 04:16.520]  And then he can ride the puppy.
[04:16.840 --> 04:16.980]  Yeah.
[04:17.120 --> 04:17.600]  Oh, that's fun.
[04:17.980 --> 04:18.920]  Hey, what are we getting into today?
[04:19.460 --> 04:20.480]  Let's get into some shit.
[04:20.720 --> 04:23.440]  First thing we're going to do is obviously we're going to open up a pack from the pack sack.
[04:23.440 --> 04:25.500]  We're going to show the graded cards from last week.
[04:25.560 --> 04:27.140]  We're going to do the mail.
[04:28.140 --> 04:29.400]  And then we'll just open up cards.
[04:29.460 --> 04:31.900]  But let me show you what we have, what we're working with.
[04:31.900 --> 04:32.760]  What's our big deal today?
[04:32.760 --> 04:33.280]  Coming in.
[04:33.340 --> 04:34.620]  And we can pick the big deal.
[04:34.700 --> 04:34.920]  Oh!
[04:35.440 --> 04:35.920]  Deal or no deal.
[04:35.920 --> 04:37.660]  A couple things I definitely want to open.
[04:37.720 --> 04:38.060]  No deal!
[04:38.280 --> 04:40.340]  NBA Prism just came out.
[04:41.440 --> 04:44.420]  And so we got a couple of blasters of that.
[04:44.460 --> 04:45.200]  Cool hand lift.
[04:45.200 --> 04:45.780]  Excited about that.
[04:45.960 --> 04:49.920]  Got a Victor Wibonyama Silver Prism over the weekend.
[04:50.200 --> 04:51.200]  I should have brought it in to show it.
[04:51.200 --> 04:52.040]  It's the card.
[04:52.040 --> 04:53.060]  I'll bring it next week.
[04:53.660 --> 04:55.640]  So we can definitely fuck with those.
[04:56.060 --> 04:57.040]  I was at your house.
[04:57.100 --> 04:57.980]  You could have just showed me.
[04:58.040 --> 04:58.480]  I could have showed you.
[04:58.560 --> 04:59.260]  You wouldn't have cared to do anything.
[04:59.320 --> 05:00.260]  We were in Super Bowl mode.
[05:00.560 --> 05:00.960]  That's right.
[05:01.000 --> 05:01.640]  We were in football mode.
[05:01.980 --> 05:02.340]  That's basketball.
[05:02.420 --> 05:04.200]  I was eating jalapeno poppers like crazy.
[05:04.300 --> 05:06.780]  Dude, I was eating so much of that goddamn pizza bread.
[05:07.240 --> 05:08.240]  Dude, the pizza bread was so good.
[05:08.520 --> 05:09.760]  Nick's buffalo chicken dip.
[05:10.700 --> 05:12.000]  I liked buffaloes.
[05:12.880 --> 05:14.140]  I was jealous about that.
[05:14.420 --> 05:15.240]  Everybody loved it.
[05:15.340 --> 05:16.220]  I liked my onion dip.
[05:16.300 --> 05:17.280]  Oh, the onion dip was really good.
[05:18.300 --> 05:19.540]  Homemade caramelized onion dip.
[05:19.540 --> 05:22.940]  I also don't like her homemade onion dip because it's got...
[05:22.940 --> 05:23.920]  What was in that?
[05:24.020 --> 05:24.500]  Cottage cheese?
[05:24.660 --> 05:27.800]  No, it has sour cream and cream cheese.
[05:31.140 --> 05:32.020]  It's normal.
[05:32.280 --> 05:33.140]  It's sour cream and cream cheese.
[05:33.620 --> 05:34.260]  It's normal.
[05:34.480 --> 05:35.700]  I'm going to say this.
[05:35.760 --> 05:37.140]  I hope this isn't too rough for this program.
[05:37.520 --> 05:40.680]  But watching her caramelize those onions yesterday, it was almost erotic.
[05:42.240 --> 05:46.200]  She was doing such a job and those onions looked so goddamn good.
[05:46.220 --> 05:48.980]  If you like this talk and more, check out Clutch My Pearl.
[05:48.980 --> 05:50.320]  I was like...
[05:54.540 --> 05:56.360]  He was all horned up.
[05:56.660 --> 05:58.640]  Do you know about Nodding yet?
[05:59.640 --> 06:00.160]  No.
[06:00.400 --> 06:04.200]  You can tune in tomorrow and learn...
[06:04.200 --> 06:07.640]  Have Eric's wife explain what Nodding is on Clutch My Pearl.
[06:09.800 --> 06:10.960]  It's a hill in England.
[06:12.820 --> 06:13.600]  Open something!
[06:14.320 --> 06:15.360]  Open some cards!
[06:15.500 --> 06:16.120]  I'm really happy with that.
[06:16.120 --> 06:18.380]  I got an approval from Gracie on that.
[06:19.500 --> 06:21.000]  Let me show you what we're working with.
[06:21.220 --> 06:24.740]  We got some more NBA prism that Gracie got for me.
[06:24.820 --> 06:25.520]  We got this.
[06:25.620 --> 06:26.320]  It must have been free.
[06:26.480 --> 06:26.920]  It's an element.
[06:27.360 --> 06:28.540]  I don't know what the fuck that is.
[06:29.560 --> 06:30.940]  I looked up...
[06:30.940 --> 06:37.440]  One of the big websites, Cardboard Connection, has the hottest boxes being sold.
[06:37.860 --> 06:41.980]  And the hottest thing being sold, the most sold right now, is this Tops Heritage Baseball.
[06:41.980 --> 06:42.800]  Line number 2023.
[06:43.240 --> 06:44.960]  So I had her buy two boxes of this.
[06:45.080 --> 06:46.200]  So maybe we'll open one of these.
[06:46.260 --> 06:46.680]  That's fun.
[06:47.020 --> 06:47.900]  And then...
[06:48.980 --> 06:50.100]  This I'm kind of interested in.
[06:50.140 --> 06:53.260]  I was going to let you guys make the decision between this and the next thing.
[06:53.520 --> 06:56.480]  This is a 2024 NES Nintendo cartridge.
[06:56.740 --> 06:57.020]  What?
[06:57.520 --> 06:58.940]  It's like a graded...
[06:58.940 --> 06:59.560]  I think it's graded.
[06:59.620 --> 07:00.140]  It may not be graded.
[07:00.200 --> 07:01.380]  But it's like a collectible...
[07:01.380 --> 07:02.040]  You don't know what you're getting.
[07:02.240 --> 07:03.220]  Cartridge blind box.
[07:03.480 --> 07:04.680]  Because these are collectible now too.
[07:04.920 --> 07:07.580]  I thought it'd be fun to fuck with some other form.
[07:07.680 --> 07:08.600]  I like that a lot.
[07:08.600 --> 07:09.560]  This is dangerous for you.
[07:09.740 --> 07:09.900]  I know.
[07:09.980 --> 07:10.880]  That's very funny.
[07:11.040 --> 07:11.780]  I like that a lot.
[07:12.000 --> 07:12.520]  So we got this.
[07:12.580 --> 07:12.880]  I want that.
[07:13.180 --> 07:13.320]  Okay.
[07:13.580 --> 07:13.900]  Or...
[07:13.900 --> 07:14.520]  I also...
[07:14.520 --> 07:17.260]  I picked up another basketball.
[07:17.260 --> 07:18.880]  I wanted to open up another big-ass basketball.
[07:19.040 --> 07:19.160]  Yeah.
[07:19.220 --> 07:20.920]  So I picked this emerald collection.
[07:20.980 --> 07:22.080]  I had Gracie buy it.
[07:22.180 --> 07:22.280]  Yeah.
[07:22.440 --> 07:23.260]  And this is it.
[07:23.320 --> 07:26.940]  And then I realized after I had her buy it, I asked her to buy the wrong thing.
[07:27.200 --> 07:28.280]  I didn't ask her to buy a basketball.
[07:28.620 --> 07:30.020]  I asked her to buy a basketball card.
[07:30.180 --> 07:31.800]  So this is just one card in here.
[07:31.860 --> 07:31.960]  What?
[07:32.460 --> 07:33.860]  That's only one card?
[07:33.920 --> 07:35.000]  Yeah, but it's going to be good.
[07:35.400 --> 07:37.440]  Oh, I want to open it up.
[07:37.500 --> 07:37.940]  I fucked up.
[07:38.040 --> 07:38.500]  I fucked up.
[07:38.640 --> 07:39.660]  So either we open up...
[07:39.660 --> 07:40.560]  I think we open up the Nintendo...
[07:40.560 --> 07:42.820]  And we're not doing this next week because it's a holiday, right?
[07:42.820 --> 07:43.300]  Yes, it is.
[07:43.360 --> 07:43.460]  Yeah.
[07:43.460 --> 07:46.000]  So we either do this very expensive card.
[07:46.880 --> 07:47.580]  I think.
[07:47.760 --> 07:48.520]  Oh my God.
[07:48.740 --> 07:51.000]  I mean, I think it is because I don't see a basketball.
[07:51.440 --> 07:53.420]  Well, maybe we just have to inflate it.
[07:53.420 --> 07:54.600]  So I think I fucked up.
[07:54.740 --> 07:57.300]  Or we can open this NES cartridge.
[07:57.400 --> 07:59.760]  We can't do both because this is the month right here.
[07:59.780 --> 08:00.360]  Here's what we'll do.
[08:00.820 --> 08:02.140]  We're going to have our own say.
[08:02.340 --> 08:07.000]  If you're in the chat, let us know right now which one it'll be, and we'll make a decision
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.120]  towards the end of the show about we're going to open one of these.
[08:09.400 --> 08:11.600]  So the chat can let us know what they think.
[08:11.740 --> 08:12.420]  I think that's a great idea.
[08:12.420 --> 08:15.940]  So it's either a single basketball card or the NES cartridge.
[08:16.100 --> 08:20.040]  And boy, I wonder what these nerds online are going to want us to do.
[08:20.040 --> 08:20.680]  My people.
[08:21.620 --> 08:23.200]  We're definitely not doing both.
[08:23.280 --> 08:23.420]  No.
[08:23.900 --> 08:24.920]  You have to pick one.
[08:25.020 --> 08:25.240]  Sorry.
[08:25.480 --> 08:25.660]  Okay.
[08:25.880 --> 08:26.620]  What do you say?
[08:27.280 --> 08:28.460]  I didn't say anything.
[08:28.600 --> 08:28.980]  You just burped?
[08:29.160 --> 08:29.600]  No, you didn't.
[08:29.960 --> 08:35.220]  I didn't burp, but my birthday was this weekend, and Andrew sent me Fresca.
[08:35.480 --> 08:36.280]  Oh, that's fun.
[08:36.760 --> 08:37.400]  That's so nice.
[08:37.640 --> 08:38.480]  He sent treats for the puppy, too.
[08:38.480 --> 08:41.280]  Yeah, he sent dog toys, Fresca, because I love it.
[08:42.520 --> 08:44.480]  And some flowers, because he's so sweet.
[08:44.580 --> 08:44.900]  He is.
[08:45.160 --> 08:45.440]  Super sweetheart.
[08:46.060 --> 08:46.840]  Seems to be real.
[08:48.140 --> 08:53.500]  I'm hoping that the cartridge is Duck Hunt, and then I'm going to say that this is a Celtic because it's green.
[08:53.820 --> 08:54.720]  Oh, that's fun.
[08:54.860 --> 08:55.340]  That'd be really nice.
[08:55.560 --> 08:58.620]  Let's do the last week's values, right?
[08:58.700 --> 08:58.880]  Okay.
[08:59.160 --> 09:02.280]  There really wasn't a lot of shit in there that was interesting, but this...
[09:03.060 --> 09:03.620]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[09:03.800 --> 09:05.980]  Autograph card we pulled, so I did some research on it.
[09:06.420 --> 09:09.260]  Got conflicting answers on what this is.
[09:09.300 --> 09:09.800]  What does that mean?
[09:09.800 --> 09:13.440]  This is a go in yard autograph orange parallel of Yard on Calvarez.
[09:13.600 --> 09:14.760]  It was the big pull last week.
[09:14.860 --> 09:20.320]  So there are two websites that list card checklists when they come out, Beckett and Cardboard Connection.
[09:20.680 --> 09:22.840]  Beckett says this is a number to 50.
[09:23.400 --> 09:25.420]  Cardboard Connection says this is number to five.
[09:25.820 --> 09:25.880]  Whoa.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.860]  It's going to be a wild difference in value depending on which is which.
[09:29.060 --> 09:31.660]  I'm not going to know the truth until I send it off and get it back.
[09:31.700 --> 09:32.720]  When do you do that?
[09:32.880 --> 09:35.800]  I didn't have time to do it last week, so I'll do it today.
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.300]  I just got to scratch off this thing.
[09:37.360 --> 09:37.720]  Wow.
[09:37.720 --> 09:39.300]  Was that the thing you got?
[09:39.940 --> 09:41.660]  You got that on this or at home?
[09:41.700 --> 09:42.820]  You got something else at home.
[09:42.880 --> 09:44.420]  Oh, the webinar that we're going to send out.
[09:44.860 --> 09:45.700]  We'll send that off to you.
[09:45.840 --> 09:48.440]  But I just need to scratch this off and enter it into the website today.
[09:48.560 --> 09:49.060]  It's called WEMBI.
[09:49.900 --> 09:50.920]  I can do that. That's easy.
[09:51.100 --> 09:55.400]  So it's either worth about $300 or $75.
[09:55.740 --> 09:56.880]  I just don't know yet.
[09:57.100 --> 09:58.580]  Dude, we got to get this eBay going already.
[09:59.160 --> 09:59.760]  I know, right?
[09:59.880 --> 10:00.320]  I'll work on it.
[10:00.520 --> 10:05.380]  But that's last week's bullshit, so I'll be back with more information on that when it finally comes in.
[10:05.380 --> 10:05.580]  Okay.
[10:06.320 --> 10:08.480]  Let's rip open something from the pack sack.
[10:09.880 --> 10:16.880]  As you know, or if you don't know, every week we reach our little grubby hands into the pack sack.
[10:17.720 --> 10:18.480]  Get way in there.
[10:18.700 --> 10:18.760]  And we pull out a pack.
[10:18.900 --> 10:20.060]  Get, like, elbow deep, man.
[10:20.160 --> 10:20.500]  What are you doing?
[10:20.520 --> 10:22.300]  Oh, I got Desert Storm cards.
[10:22.840 --> 10:23.160]  Wow.
[10:23.520 --> 10:23.840]  He disgraces me for that.
[10:23.840 --> 10:25.040]  Yeah, he loves it.
[10:25.280 --> 10:25.600]  I got this in there.
[10:25.680 --> 10:27.080]  This guy just, like, loves Kuwait.
[10:27.920 --> 10:28.640]  He misses it.
[10:28.800 --> 10:29.940]  That's been almost a year of my life.
[10:30.260 --> 10:31.540]  I've been there three times.
[10:32.900 --> 10:34.520]  We talked about it on Animal Recording today.
[10:34.520 --> 10:35.840]  Geoff went to college for a little while.
[10:35.920 --> 10:36.880]  Stuff I didn't know about.
[10:37.100 --> 10:39.400]  You didn't know I went to the University of South Carolina for a little bit.
[10:39.540 --> 10:39.680]  Yeah.
[10:40.540 --> 10:41.340]  Go Gamecocks.
[10:41.480 --> 10:41.880]  Is that you?
[10:42.320 --> 10:42.540]  Yeah.
[10:42.860 --> 10:43.280]  Daddy's home.
[10:43.400 --> 10:44.720]  No way, baby.
[10:44.960 --> 10:45.540]  That's me.
[10:45.760 --> 10:46.500]  Safe at home.
[10:47.120 --> 10:47.300]  Oh.
[10:49.880 --> 10:50.280]  Reunited.
[10:50.620 --> 10:51.600]  So are these just all, like, coming home?
[10:51.600 --> 10:53.900]  These are all just one guy coming home.
[10:54.100 --> 10:54.340]  Yeah.
[10:54.760 --> 10:56.600]  Here's some target markings, whatever that means.
[10:56.640 --> 10:58.620]  I guess that's how many bullets for each of those things.
[10:58.760 --> 10:59.060]  Wow.
[11:00.420 --> 11:01.220]  Francois Mitterrand.
[11:01.620 --> 11:04.000]  And then we have, of course, the Iraqi Surrender.
[11:04.500 --> 11:04.920]  Is that you?
[11:05.400 --> 11:06.500]  Uh, okay.
[11:06.540 --> 11:06.920]  Did you do that?
[11:07.460 --> 11:07.740]  I did it.
[11:08.020 --> 11:11.500]  That's Iraqi Surrender C. Here's Iraqi Surrender A.
[11:11.540 --> 11:12.080]  Oh, wow.
[11:12.280 --> 11:13.360]  If we get B, we get the whole set.
[11:13.400 --> 11:14.580]  Ooh, we get the big dog.
[11:14.760 --> 11:15.940]  We get the big swinging dick.
[11:16.340 --> 11:17.820]  General Colin Powell himself.
[11:18.020 --> 11:18.120]  Oh, man.
[11:18.320 --> 11:19.420]  Dang, big dog.
[11:19.840 --> 11:20.740]  And then, oh, check it out.
[11:20.760 --> 11:22.120]  There's a little Medal of Honor.
[11:22.280 --> 11:23.080]  Did you get one of those?
[11:23.140 --> 11:23.940]  I did not.
[11:24.260 --> 11:25.060]  No, no.
[11:25.120 --> 11:29.120]  I didn't do anything in my time in the military that warranted a medal.
[11:29.160 --> 11:30.080]  I got a couple of ARCOMs.
[11:30.140 --> 11:30.540]  Those are nice.
[11:30.540 --> 11:31.540]  That's awesome.
[11:32.080 --> 11:33.160]  I don't know what that is.
[11:33.160 --> 11:33.560]  I got some AAMs.
[11:33.600 --> 11:34.220]  What's an ARCOM?
[11:34.220 --> 11:35.340]  Army Commendation Medal.
[11:35.600 --> 11:35.820]  Oh.
[11:36.040 --> 11:37.040]  Army Achievement Medal.
[11:37.100 --> 11:37.920]  I got a bunch of those.
[11:37.980 --> 11:39.180]  Got some Foreign Service stuff.
[11:39.380 --> 11:42.380]  I mean, you went to school until they had to kick you out of school to go to Kuwait.
[11:42.580 --> 11:42.980]  That's true.
[11:43.020 --> 11:43.380]  That's true.
[11:43.460 --> 11:44.660]  I did have to leave my fucking school.
[11:45.040 --> 11:47.200]  Uh, we also got something a little bit special this week.
[11:47.300 --> 11:47.420]  Okay.
[11:47.420 --> 11:47.680]  We'll do a mail.
[11:48.000 --> 11:48.380]  Let's do it.
[11:48.540 --> 11:51.340]  Yesterday, I was hand-delivered a package by Bernie Batdog.
[11:51.620 --> 11:51.880]  Oh!
[11:52.160 --> 11:52.600]  Text Bernie.
[11:52.900 --> 11:53.540]  Break show.
[11:54.080 --> 11:55.520]  G-Bone and People's Princess.
[11:56.000 --> 11:56.360]  Wow.
[11:56.740 --> 11:59.360]  He also drew, for Emily's birthday, he drew me a picture.
[11:59.360 --> 12:00.580]  A great picture of you.
[12:01.000 --> 12:01.380]  There you go.
[12:01.460 --> 12:02.360]  Oh, you can see it in Geoff's shot.
[12:02.400 --> 12:02.960]  That's so cool.
[12:03.440 --> 12:03.640]  That's great.
[12:03.860 --> 12:06.720]  For some reason, he was like, yeah, it's Emily's birthday, so I thought I'd drop it for you.
[12:06.780 --> 12:06.840]  Yeah.
[12:06.840 --> 12:07.120]  Yeah, it's good.
[12:07.200 --> 12:08.280]  So what do we got from the Batdog?
[12:08.280 --> 12:08.900]  Let's see what we got from him.
[12:08.900 --> 12:10.300]  Man, he was taking care of your dog last night.
[12:10.300 --> 12:10.720]  I knew it.
[12:10.760 --> 12:11.640]  He put change in it.
[12:11.720 --> 12:12.000]  Why?
[12:12.180 --> 12:12.760]  I don't know.
[12:13.280 --> 12:14.200]  Because he's his uncle.
[12:14.440 --> 12:15.880]  He also gave him...
[12:15.880 --> 12:17.480]  He tried to give him beer last night.
[12:17.920 --> 12:18.400]  Oh, yeah.
[12:18.400 --> 12:18.960]  He tried to give the baby beer.
[12:19.040 --> 12:20.220]  Just a little bit.
[12:20.320 --> 12:21.960]  And it was just a Bud Light.
[12:26.360 --> 12:27.520]  He's got such good handwriting.
[12:27.540 --> 12:27.800]  Really?
[12:27.960 --> 12:28.320]  He's an artist.
[12:28.560 --> 12:29.200]  He really is.
[12:29.480 --> 12:33.280]  Dear G-Bone, the People's Princess, and whoever showed up this week, probably not you.
[12:33.300 --> 12:33.740]  Come on, man.
[12:33.780 --> 12:33.920]  What the fuck?
[12:34.020 --> 12:37.180]  I present to you three packs of cards from when I was a baby kiddo.
[12:37.260 --> 12:40.220]  They're not too crusty and have only been underwater once or twice.
[12:40.480 --> 12:41.660]  I think you'll enjoy opening them.
[12:41.900 --> 12:45.400]  On your program, the Batman bubble gum is still good to feel free to share with the rest
[12:45.400 --> 12:45.860]  of the crew.
[12:45.900 --> 12:46.240]  Thanks, bud.
[12:46.240 --> 12:49.680]  I don't want the gum to go to waste, so I've included return postage.
[12:52.180 --> 12:54.160]  PS, listen to Clutch My Pearls podcast.
[12:54.500 --> 12:54.540]  Sorry.
[12:55.380 --> 12:57.340]  See you in the mud, Barney Batdog.
[12:57.400 --> 12:58.660]  Well, that's going up on the wall right there.
[12:58.680 --> 12:59.120]  That's good.
[12:59.160 --> 13:00.140]  And there's the return postage.
[13:00.640 --> 13:01.540]  Let's see what he got us.
[13:01.640 --> 13:03.660]  We got Batman, Batman, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[13:03.720 --> 13:04.120]  Ooh, nice.
[13:04.160 --> 13:04.300]  Really?
[13:04.540 --> 13:04.900]  All right.
[13:04.940 --> 13:05.080]  Cool.
[13:05.140 --> 13:05.540]  Let's do it.
[13:05.800 --> 13:06.880]  We gotta eat that gum, too.
[13:09.200 --> 13:13.800]  Vanessa told me that he woke up this morning pissed that we didn't eat enough of that queso
[13:13.800 --> 13:14.620]  last night.
[13:15.880 --> 13:17.500]  Dude, I forgot the queso was there.
[13:17.600 --> 13:18.860]  I wish I would've eaten the queso.
[13:19.160 --> 13:20.200]  What are you doing, Geoff?
[13:20.360 --> 13:21.080]  I ate the gum.
[13:21.160 --> 13:21.660]  You idiot.
[13:21.660 --> 13:22.380]  He said it was still good.
[13:22.640 --> 13:23.440]  It was.
[13:23.440 --> 13:24.580]  I ate it.
[13:24.740 --> 13:25.000]  Ugh.
[13:25.300 --> 13:25.600]  Barney.
[13:25.660 --> 13:26.120]  Fucking hell.
[13:27.340 --> 13:27.740]  Burndog.
[13:28.200 --> 13:31.140]  Yeah, people were upset about the food that didn't get eaten last night.
[13:31.700 --> 13:33.120]  I mean, that's how parties work.
[13:33.300 --> 13:34.440]  I would've just eaten more.
[13:34.540 --> 13:36.340]  Yeah, I went crazy on Nick's dip.
[13:36.420 --> 13:36.860]  It was bad.
[13:37.140 --> 13:40.240]  First card we got from Barney Batdog is the Joker himself.
[13:40.760 --> 13:41.720]  I hate these movies.
[13:42.320 --> 13:42.620]  What?
[13:42.920 --> 13:43.800]  You didn't like the Tim Burton Batman?
[13:43.920 --> 13:45.160]  They're so gross to look at.
[13:45.260 --> 13:46.080]  Oh, I love it.
[13:46.120 --> 13:46.500]  I hate it.
[13:46.580 --> 13:48.220]  Speaking of, that's his vision.
[13:48.420 --> 13:49.360]  It is just so ugly.
[13:49.360 --> 13:51.540]  Do you prefer the Robert Pattinson, like, moody one?
[13:51.540 --> 13:53.540]  It's not the moodiness that I like.
[13:53.640 --> 13:56.580]  It's just that, like, this era of filmmaking is, like, vile to me.
[13:56.800 --> 13:58.220]  It's so gross.
[13:58.400 --> 13:59.620]  Do you remember when he was like,
[13:59.900 --> 14:03.140]  Hey, Batman, do you ever dangle with the devil in the pale moonlight?
[14:03.380 --> 14:04.040]  He didn't say he said dance.
[14:04.040 --> 14:04.840]  No, he said dance.
[14:05.020 --> 14:11.640]  Um, it's just like, well, this is a comic and we're going to make it in real life.
[14:11.700 --> 14:12.900]  It's like, oh, is there creative liberty?
[14:13.500 --> 14:13.900]  No!
[14:14.060 --> 14:15.440]  We make it in real life.
[14:15.600 --> 14:16.160]  I hate it.
[14:16.320 --> 14:17.400]  Dude, here's something for us.
[14:17.400 --> 14:19.080]  Knox chats with Alfred.
[14:19.200 --> 14:20.040]  And who is Knox?
[14:20.180 --> 14:21.460]  But Robert Wall.
[14:21.760 --> 14:22.720]  We got his autograph.
[14:23.060 --> 14:23.860]  Oh, yeah.
[14:23.860 --> 14:24.560]  Big Bob Wall.
[14:24.680 --> 14:24.900]  Yeah.
[14:25.020 --> 14:25.600]  We got his autograph.
[14:25.920 --> 14:27.140]  It might be in here.
[14:27.760 --> 14:29.020]  What was he, from Batman?
[14:30.120 --> 14:32.280]  Uh, it was, it was, I don't have it with me.
[14:32.400 --> 14:33.500]  It's probably in the office.
[14:33.620 --> 14:37.560]  But it was from, it was from something else he did.
[14:37.660 --> 14:38.380]  Yeah, I don't remember.
[14:38.480 --> 14:38.900]  We got it like two weeks ago.
[14:39.180 --> 14:40.160]  That hat's so good.
[14:40.280 --> 14:41.920]  It even has a uniform logo in the back.
[14:41.940 --> 14:42.300]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:42.380 --> 14:45.400]  What Tim Burton wants, Tim Burton gets.
[14:45.480 --> 14:46.200]  Creative liberty.
[14:46.200 --> 14:46.760]  Gross.
[14:47.400 --> 14:48.840]  Danger in the streets.
[14:49.980 --> 14:51.300]  That's when, before they get killed.
[14:51.380 --> 14:52.240]  It's like this.
[14:52.340 --> 14:54.800]  You know what they say, danger in the streets, boring in the sheets.
[14:54.880 --> 14:55.080]  Yeah.
[14:55.380 --> 14:58.520]  Uh, it's like this and Dick Tracy and like those.
[14:58.660 --> 14:59.220]  Roger Rabbit?
[14:59.360 --> 14:59.600]  Yeah.
[15:00.780 --> 15:01.140]  Please!
[15:03.340 --> 15:04.540]  Tim Burton filmmaker.
[15:05.360 --> 15:06.560]  Just in case you didn't know.
[15:06.760 --> 15:09.160]  Who, who for real killed Batman's parents?
[15:09.960 --> 15:11.000]  No, it was just, it was just.
[15:11.160 --> 15:11.700]  They still never know.
[15:12.280 --> 15:13.540]  It's just, it's just a guy.
[15:13.620 --> 15:14.000]  He'll never know.
[15:14.340 --> 15:15.240]  I mean, they've changed the story.
[15:15.240 --> 15:17.420]  They tried to wreck on it to be like, it's the Joker.
[15:17.640 --> 15:19.560]  But it's really, you're not supposed to.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.520]  It's just like, it was just a random criminal.
[15:21.620 --> 15:21.840]  Yes.
[15:21.920 --> 15:22.460]  That's why he's obsessed.
[15:22.480 --> 15:23.800]  Because that's the way crime happens.
[15:23.920 --> 15:27.700]  Because if he knew, if he knew who killed his parents, he could go avenge their death.
[15:27.800 --> 15:27.900]  Yeah.
[15:27.920 --> 15:30.580]  He could go be a normal person and get over it.
[15:30.580 --> 15:32.160]  But he can't because he doesn't know.
[15:32.340 --> 15:33.640]  A faceless person killed them.
[15:33.740 --> 15:35.500]  So he has to eradicate all crime.
[15:35.620 --> 15:37.100]  He was but a boy when it happened, Emily.
[15:37.120 --> 15:37.400]  He was.
[15:37.480 --> 15:38.500]  Yeah, and in a dark alley.
[15:39.440 --> 15:41.080]  In fact, it was Crime Alley.
[15:41.620 --> 15:43.020]  Ah, they should rename that.
[15:43.380 --> 15:46.240]  They should call it Cool Alley or something, you know what I mean?
[15:46.840 --> 15:49.380]  Oh, these are TMNT 1 movie photos.
[15:49.540 --> 15:51.120]  I don't know that we've opened these yet.
[15:52.140 --> 15:54.480]  We've opened some, but I don't know if these...
[15:54.480 --> 15:55.240]  Oh, fuck!
[15:55.680 --> 15:55.900]  Sticker.
[15:56.100 --> 15:57.100]  We got a Donatello sticker.
[15:57.260 --> 15:57.800]  Oh, that's cool.
[15:57.900 --> 15:58.880]  Is that the worst Ninja Turtle?
[15:59.060 --> 15:59.180]  Pretty cool.
[15:59.300 --> 16:00.220]  Who's the worst Ninja Turtle?
[16:00.800 --> 16:02.020]  You're too old for Ninja Turtles.
[16:02.320 --> 16:02.740]  I only like baby.
[16:02.740 --> 16:03.480]  I'm not too old for them.
[16:03.680 --> 16:03.860]  No?
[16:04.040 --> 16:07.620]  When I was a kid, Ninja Turtles were big because they were happening.
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.160]  Like the Eastman Laird comics were coming out in the mid-80s when I was a kid.
[16:11.200 --> 16:11.380]  Yeah.
[16:11.380 --> 16:12.420]  And so they were cool.
[16:12.560 --> 16:15.360]  Like, I remember we used to get these Ninja... these books.
[16:16.380 --> 16:22.900]  My friend had one that just had drawings of all the Ninja Turtles doing combat poses.
[16:23.160 --> 16:26.640]  And it was just like... almost like a tutorial on martial arts.
[16:26.840 --> 16:28.200]  It was, like, very serious early on.
[16:28.300 --> 16:29.100]  It was really cool.
[16:29.220 --> 16:29.280]  Yeah.
[16:29.420 --> 16:29.920]  It was gritty.
[16:30.120 --> 16:31.680]  They all wore, like, the one color.
[16:31.780 --> 16:32.880]  They weren't different colors.
[16:33.580 --> 16:34.260]  Armed and anxious.
[16:34.660 --> 16:37.380]  But to answer your question, probably Donatello.
[16:38.040 --> 16:38.180]  Yeah.
[16:39.380 --> 16:40.360]  Raphael to the rescue!
[16:41.380 --> 16:42.400]  He's wearing that...
[16:42.400 --> 16:44.220]  Yeah, no one will ever suspect that he's a giant turtle.
[16:44.400 --> 16:47.400]  He's either a giant turtle or a Sam Spade-style P.I.
[16:47.620 --> 16:48.740]  Getting to the bottom of the case.
[16:49.160 --> 16:50.120]  Pursued by the enemy.
[16:50.500 --> 16:51.300]  Was the enemy a train?
[16:51.440 --> 16:52.540]  The enemy's very small.
[16:53.160 --> 16:53.500]  Casey.
[16:53.700 --> 16:54.460]  Mr. Fix-It.
[16:54.620 --> 16:54.820]  Yep.
[16:55.060 --> 16:55.580]  Oh, yeah.
[16:55.960 --> 16:56.620]  Speaking of Casey.
[16:56.800 --> 16:57.260]  There you go.
[16:58.240 --> 16:59.740]  Tough rocks, Raphael!
[16:59.840 --> 17:00.340]  Oh, my God.
[17:00.420 --> 17:01.640]  The battle rages on.
[17:02.680 --> 17:03.520]  Just hanging.
[17:03.640 --> 17:04.260]  That's all we're doing.
[17:04.460 --> 17:04.640]  Yeah.
[17:05.140 --> 17:06.520]  April gets carried away.
[17:06.720 --> 17:07.120]  April.
[17:07.560 --> 17:08.700]  Oh, carried away.
[17:08.880 --> 17:11.080]  Raphael revives from the bathtub, it looks like.
[17:11.080 --> 17:11.560]  Yeah.
[17:11.660 --> 17:13.580]  And then next we have Batman Returns.
[17:13.640 --> 17:15.220]  It was the number one hit movie.
[17:15.760 --> 17:16.480]  It's true.
[17:16.600 --> 17:17.180]  It was.
[17:17.300 --> 17:19.080]  Who do you feel is the ultimate Batman?
[17:19.520 --> 17:21.220]  Like, if you had to choose the actors.
[17:22.020 --> 17:24.640]  Val Kilmer, George Clooney.
[17:24.800 --> 17:25.780]  Oh, who do I pick?
[17:25.900 --> 17:26.500]  Why Batman?
[17:27.140 --> 17:27.560]  Bruce Wayne.
[17:29.080 --> 17:30.100]  I don't go for the others.
[17:30.100 --> 17:30.400]  What do you mean?
[17:30.600 --> 17:31.560]  The Playboy billionaire?
[17:31.980 --> 17:32.380]  Yeah.
[17:35.120 --> 17:36.040]  Ooh, look at this.
[17:36.080 --> 17:36.720]  Batman Returns.
[17:36.780 --> 17:37.580]  Speaking of Batman.
[17:37.800 --> 17:39.080]  There we have...
[17:40.000 --> 17:40.340]  Jacobs.
[17:41.120 --> 17:41.460]  Gravestone.
[17:42.720 --> 17:44.400]  Sultan of the Sewers.
[17:45.020 --> 17:46.080]  That's like a...
[17:46.740 --> 17:47.220]  I like...
[17:47.220 --> 17:48.580]  It's like, look at it.
[17:48.640 --> 17:49.240]  It's gross.
[17:49.380 --> 17:50.060]  Yeah, it's very Tim Burton.
[17:50.500 --> 17:51.520]  A penguin scorer.
[17:51.540 --> 17:52.900]  I don't like any of Tim Burton stuff.
[17:53.180 --> 17:53.220]  Rallying his troops.
[17:53.220 --> 17:54.880]  He is just the guy for this.
[17:55.060 --> 17:55.160]  Ugh.
[17:55.740 --> 17:56.420]  Invading Gotham.
[17:56.460 --> 17:57.560]  So you don't like any Tim Burton stuff?
[17:57.580 --> 17:58.120]  No, I don't think so.
[17:58.220 --> 17:58.800]  You don't like Pee-wee's Big Adventure?
[17:59.840 --> 18:01.640]  I had a whole conversation about this the other day.
[18:01.660 --> 18:03.300]  I'm not a huge Pee-wee's Playhouse guy.
[18:03.560 --> 18:04.380]  I like the movies.
[18:04.460 --> 18:05.220]  Like, the movie's fun.
[18:06.100 --> 18:06.500]  But...
[18:06.940 --> 18:10.060]  Man, when I look at it for too long, it's just like, get this away from me.
[18:10.080 --> 18:10.980]  I fucking love that movie.
[18:11.220 --> 18:12.640]  I get what you're saying about Tim Burton.
[18:12.720 --> 18:14.380]  I'm not as into Tim Burton as a lot of young people.
[18:14.520 --> 18:16.700]  It's Frankie Weenie fucking Edward Scissorhands shit.
[18:16.820 --> 18:17.620]  I can't...
[18:17.620 --> 18:18.580]  Beetlejuice ass.
[18:20.220 --> 18:21.700]  In the Clown's Clutches.
[18:22.400 --> 18:22.980]  Aren't we all?
[18:23.700 --> 18:24.760]  Birth of the Catwoman.
[18:25.120 --> 18:25.420]  Meow.
[18:26.020 --> 18:26.420]  That...
[18:26.420 --> 18:30.300]  She seems like she was born a fully adult human being.
[18:30.720 --> 18:31.000]  Strange.
[18:31.500 --> 18:32.620]  Hate to see that birth canal.
[18:32.980 --> 18:34.320]  The fuck is happening?
[18:34.320 --> 18:35.180]  Birth of Catwoman.
[18:35.200 --> 18:36.360]  Go to the next car.
[18:36.600 --> 18:36.880]  Birth of Catwoman.
[18:36.900 --> 18:38.380]  Go to the next car.
[18:39.140 --> 18:39.340]  Okay.
[18:39.840 --> 18:39.860]  Meow.
[18:42.840 --> 18:44.000]  Shrek's Final Stand.
[18:44.220 --> 18:44.600]  Shrek!
[18:45.400 --> 18:46.200]  Different Shrek.
[18:47.440 --> 18:47.780]  Donkey!
[18:47.780 --> 18:48.720]  Not the one I'm used to.
[18:49.200 --> 18:50.060]  Shrek looks like a...
[18:50.060 --> 18:51.320]  Dude, get out of his swamp!
[18:51.520 --> 18:53.620]  Shrek looks like that little dork from the Harry Potter.
[18:53.740 --> 18:54.140]  What's his name?
[18:54.820 --> 18:55.500]  Harry Potter?
[18:55.780 --> 18:56.000]  Isn't that Christopher Walken?
[18:56.000 --> 18:57.200]  Yeah, no, the blonde one.
[18:57.320 --> 18:57.720]  Malfoy.
[18:57.920 --> 18:58.140]  Yeah.
[18:58.440 --> 18:59.680]  That's Christopher Walken though, right?
[19:00.200 --> 19:00.480]  Is that?
[19:00.480 --> 19:00.660]  Yeah.
[19:00.840 --> 19:01.540]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:01.540 --> 19:02.420]  That is Christopher Walken.
[19:02.420 --> 19:03.280]  His commercial yesterday on...
[19:03.280 --> 19:03.560]  It was cute.
[19:03.700 --> 19:06.320]  What was the one commercial that got us all silent?
[19:07.140 --> 19:09.820]  Was it the one where everyone was like sucking on toes or whatever?
[19:09.940 --> 19:10.280]  It wasn't the feet.
[19:10.360 --> 19:11.360]  We were only screaming feet.
[19:11.500 --> 19:15.220]  But there was one commercial that made us all silent.
[19:15.680 --> 19:16.640]  What was that?
[19:16.680 --> 19:17.140]  I don't know.
[19:17.460 --> 19:20.200]  There was the Robert Kennedy one where we just kept going,
[19:20.980 --> 19:21.380]  Unbelievable!
[19:21.720 --> 19:23.340]  That one I think got us silent though.
[19:23.460 --> 19:25.080]  I was going, is this fucking happening?
[19:25.080 --> 19:26.860]  We could not believe that it was.
[19:26.960 --> 19:29.620]  Did they just color the eyes?
[19:30.700 --> 19:31.620]  Why is it?
[19:31.800 --> 19:32.600]  What are we doing?
[19:33.400 --> 19:34.220]  That's what it was.
[19:34.280 --> 19:35.080]  It was the Kennedy one.
[19:35.280 --> 19:37.440]  By the way, he has already issued an apology today for that.
[19:37.720 --> 19:38.180]  Has he really?
[19:38.800 --> 19:39.780]  Well, he was very careful.
[19:39.840 --> 19:42.040]  He said, I apologize if that commercial offended you.
[19:42.040 --> 19:42.580]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:42.580 --> 19:44.660]  I apologize that I used my campaign funds on that.
[19:44.660 --> 19:48.720]  I apologize that I used my dad's old commercial or my grandfather's commercial and stuck it in.
[19:48.780 --> 19:49.640]  Or uncle, I guess.
[19:51.060 --> 19:52.040]  Okay, what's next?
[19:52.560 --> 19:53.240]  That was from Bad Dog.
[19:53.260 --> 19:53.840]  Thank you, Bad Dog.
[19:53.960 --> 19:54.360]  Thank you, Bernie, Bad Dog.
[19:54.920 --> 19:55.600]  You're the best.
[19:56.100 --> 19:56.940]  Let's... fuck this.
[19:56.940 --> 19:57.800]  I don't know what this is.
[19:57.800 --> 20:00.340]  And also, there's nothing on the back that's readable, so...
[20:00.340 --> 20:00.800]  Yeah, what is...
[20:01.400 --> 20:04.800]  This is the shit we had laying around the office that we didn't know how to get rid of.
[20:05.540 --> 20:08.100]  Gracie looked at it and went, oh, no, we're gonna let him open this.
[20:08.340 --> 20:09.020]  Oh, this is great.
[20:09.140 --> 20:09.420]  Cards.
[20:09.520 --> 20:11.080]  If they're no good, Fisher's gonna love these.
[20:11.140 --> 20:11.540]  Which fucking...
[20:11.540 --> 20:12.480]  Fisher, this one's for you, buddy.
[20:12.580 --> 20:13.200]  We got two of the...
[20:13.200 --> 20:14.220]  All right, well, this is gonna go in the pack.
[20:14.220 --> 20:14.400]  Yeah.
[20:14.500 --> 20:15.000]  Right away.
[20:15.600 --> 20:15.780]  Yeah.
[20:15.980 --> 20:17.120]  Is this for the new movie?
[20:17.500 --> 20:18.220]  Or is this the old one?
[20:18.400 --> 20:18.680]  New...
[20:19.280 --> 20:20.880]  Elemental is a new...
[20:20.880 --> 20:22.380]  Oh, what's the other one's emotions?
[20:22.400 --> 20:23.720]  We were talking about this yesterday.
[20:23.920 --> 20:24.100]  Yeah.
[20:24.100 --> 20:25.580]  Inside Out...
[20:25.580 --> 20:28.400]  Inside Out 2 and Elemental are too fucking confusing.
[20:28.760 --> 20:28.800]  Yeah.
[20:29.400 --> 20:32.860]  I think it's just too similar with, like, here's the color of this guy.
[20:33.060 --> 20:33.100]  Yeah.
[20:33.180 --> 20:34.380]  And here's the color of this guy.
[20:34.480 --> 20:35.880]  And is Elemental...
[20:35.880 --> 20:38.880]  Do they represent, like, the elements on the periodic table?
[20:39.000 --> 20:39.640]  How did you say that?
[20:40.720 --> 20:41.160]  Elements...
[20:41.160 --> 20:44.100]  I think it's, like, fire, wind, water...
[20:44.700 --> 20:44.960]  Heart.
[20:45.020 --> 20:45.500]  Those elements.
[20:45.600 --> 20:45.740]  Heart.
[20:46.600 --> 20:46.720]  Yeah.
[20:46.960 --> 20:47.840]  What the fuck is this?
[20:47.840 --> 20:49.220]  What are these?
[20:49.800 --> 20:50.680]  What's happening?
[20:51.420 --> 20:51.980]  It's a film set.
[20:52.120 --> 20:52.560]  Oh!
[20:53.360 --> 20:53.760]  Wow!
[20:54.120 --> 20:55.660]  These movies aren't on film!
[20:55.800 --> 20:56.860]  Do you need this on Wi-Fi?
[20:57.920 --> 20:59.580]  It's an animated movie!
[21:01.080 --> 21:01.880]  What's happening?
[21:02.560 --> 21:04.060]  Alright, well...
[21:04.060 --> 21:05.440]  Do we have a bunch of those?
[21:05.620 --> 21:06.380]  I don't want those.
[21:06.820 --> 21:07.320]  We got...
[21:07.320 --> 21:08.120]  Let's open up one more.
[21:08.220 --> 21:09.000]  We'll save the others.
[21:09.260 --> 21:09.920]  Let's see what this one is.
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.800]  I'm gonna guess this one's the same fucking thing, but with this character.
[21:13.580 --> 21:14.400]  The blue character.
[21:14.440 --> 21:14.960]  Why is it...
[21:14.960 --> 21:16.160]  Aw, he's so cute, though!
[21:16.840 --> 21:18.060]  He's probably a water guy.
[21:20.020 --> 21:20.680]  Here's the deal.
[21:20.680 --> 21:24.680]  It was given away for free, so that's probably the value it has.
[21:26.120 --> 21:26.840]  Yeah, these...
[21:26.840 --> 21:28.360]  Again, it's on film!
[21:28.600 --> 21:29.660]  This movie isn't on film.
[21:29.740 --> 21:30.560]  It's not like it was shot.
[21:32.080 --> 21:32.800]  It's animated.
[21:33.020 --> 21:33.980]  It's an animation cell.
[21:34.340 --> 21:36.400]  Again, not how this is made.
[21:37.480 --> 21:37.840]  Cool.
[21:38.480 --> 21:40.140]  Not how this is made, but I like it.
[21:40.200 --> 21:40.780]  That's weird.
[21:41.140 --> 21:43.920]  It's going right there with a Medal of Honor as my card of the day so far.
[21:44.940 --> 21:46.740]  Alright, let's open up a little bit of basketball.
[21:47.000 --> 21:47.740]  Let's do it.
[21:48.000 --> 21:48.180]  Oh!
[21:48.400 --> 21:49.180]  Didn't you get me a treat?
[21:49.180 --> 21:50.120]  We're supposed to open up...
[21:50.120 --> 21:51.660]  I did, and we're supposed to open up mail.
[21:51.860 --> 21:52.160]  I'm sorry.
[21:52.260 --> 21:52.740]  One thing at a time.
[21:53.060 --> 21:54.200]  Alright, this is from Colm.
[21:55.340 --> 21:56.140]  I don't...
[21:56.140 --> 21:57.480]  One thing at a time, Emily.
[21:58.340 --> 21:59.960]  I'm just trying to go in the order I presented it.
[22:00.280 --> 22:02.380]  And Colm didn't send us a letter or note or anything.
[22:03.780 --> 22:05.680]  But they did send a...
[22:05.680 --> 22:06.240]  Holy shit!
[22:06.280 --> 22:09.400]  Box of unopened 792 cards.
[22:09.760 --> 22:12.420]  Major League Baseball 1991 complete set.
[22:12.500 --> 22:14.680]  Now here's what this is gonna have in it.
[22:14.760 --> 22:15.060]  Whoa.
[22:15.120 --> 22:16.280]  It's gonna have...
[22:16.280 --> 22:16.400]  It's a Zim.
[22:16.640 --> 22:17.480]  A Dawn Zim.
[22:18.200 --> 22:20.200]  Should we pop it open and just look at it?
[22:20.320 --> 22:20.980]  See if we can find it.
[22:20.980 --> 22:22.420]  We haven't had a Zim in so long.
[22:22.540 --> 22:23.720]  We haven't opened up a...
[22:23.720 --> 22:25.560]  I don't know if we've ever opened up a...
[22:25.560 --> 22:26.680]  Oh, this is...
[22:26.680 --> 22:27.720]  Wow, that's a...
[22:27.720 --> 22:28.700]  ...bin opened, I think.
[22:29.020 --> 22:29.280]  Yeah.
[22:29.620 --> 22:30.420]  Alright, let's see.
[22:36.110 --> 22:36.470]  Careful.
[22:41.190 --> 22:42.430]  Is it just the cards?
[22:42.650 --> 22:43.330]  Yeah, it's just...
[22:43.330 --> 22:45.010]  I mean, I don't even think there's anything extra in it.
[22:45.110 --> 22:47.050]  It's just one through 792.
[22:47.610 --> 22:48.370]  It's the whole thing?
[22:48.370 --> 22:49.590]  Yeah, it's the whole set.
[22:49.790 --> 22:51.730]  So wherever Dawn Zimmer is in here...
[22:51.730 --> 22:52.970]  What number is Dawn Zimmer?
[22:52.970 --> 22:54.550]  Here, do this and then I'll tell you when to stop.
[22:56.090 --> 22:56.510]  Faster.
[22:57.650 --> 22:58.070]  Faster?
[22:58.330 --> 22:58.530]  Stop.
[23:01.010 --> 23:01.430]  Faster.
[23:01.750 --> 23:01.950]  Faster.
[23:02.770 --> 23:04.290]  I got nails, I can help you.
[23:04.770 --> 23:05.930]  Here, let me get in on this.
[23:06.490 --> 23:08.110]  This is all coming together.
[23:08.270 --> 23:08.790]  There you go.
[23:09.490 --> 23:10.270]  Now flip through those.
[23:10.370 --> 23:10.830]  Bo Jackson!
[23:11.150 --> 23:11.570]  Hey!
[23:11.890 --> 23:13.130]  That's who you pulled, Bo Jackson.
[23:13.490 --> 23:13.930]  Hell yeah.
[23:14.230 --> 23:14.690]  Pretty cool.
[23:15.790 --> 23:16.210]  600...
[23:16.210 --> 23:17.070]  We could do an instant one.
[23:17.070 --> 23:17.830]  These are not in order.
[23:21.230 --> 23:21.870]  Carlton Fisk.
[23:23.010 --> 23:23.650]  That's awesome.
[23:23.750 --> 23:26.030]  This is one of the good Zimmer cards, too.
[23:26.170 --> 23:26.970]  So we'll find that.
[23:27.330 --> 23:27.970]  Thank you so much, Colin.
[23:28.050 --> 23:28.950]  That is awesome, man.
[23:29.150 --> 23:30.850]  And we really appreciate that.
[23:30.870 --> 23:32.630]  And we're really excited to fuck around with these.
[23:32.870 --> 23:33.170]  What'd you say?
[23:33.450 --> 23:34.310]  I'm talking to the bird.
[23:34.590 --> 23:35.250]  We like that.
[23:35.270 --> 23:35.750]  That was pretty good.
[23:35.910 --> 23:36.650]  I don't want to hear you there.
[23:37.510 --> 23:38.030]  All right.
[23:39.210 --> 23:40.490]  We'll put those there right here.
[23:40.550 --> 23:43.070]  And then somebody else sent in...
[23:45.690 --> 23:48.850]  This is from...
[23:49.610 --> 23:50.510]  Sydney with Thank You Note.
[23:50.770 --> 23:52.250]  You can learn more about your gift.
[23:52.290 --> 23:53.570]  Okay, that's not...
[23:54.950 --> 23:57.830]  Well, to the person that sent us this...
[23:57.830 --> 23:57.990]  Amazon.
[23:58.410 --> 23:58.870]  Amazon.
[23:59.270 --> 24:00.450]  Let's see if it has...
[24:00.450 --> 24:01.270]  Yeah, it's not going to have any...
[24:02.510 --> 24:06.670]  I don't know who you are, but I'm so thankful that you sent this box of...
[24:06.670 --> 24:07.810]  Who are you?!
[24:07.810 --> 24:08.850]  Major League Soccer.
[24:09.450 --> 24:10.550]  Topps Major League Soccer.
[24:10.910 --> 24:11.390]  Cards.
[24:11.470 --> 24:12.350]  66 cards total.
[24:12.350 --> 24:13.750]  Let's see what's up.
[24:13.910 --> 24:15.830]  I don't think we've opened these yet before.
[24:16.530 --> 24:19.650]  My pick of the day is the Sultan of the Sewers.
[24:20.430 --> 24:26.790]  Because it reminds me of the Touch My Pearls episode where they went to Dark Olympus.
[24:26.930 --> 24:31.510]  It was the Hades and I can only compare him to Oswald Cobblepot because that's what I imagined.
[24:31.910 --> 24:33.570]  You're not good at...
[24:34.070 --> 24:34.450]  No.
[24:34.750 --> 24:38.710]  You're like so bad at picking who a person is.
[24:38.890 --> 24:39.090]  Yeah.
[24:39.770 --> 24:41.290]  Like, it's exceptional.
[24:41.290 --> 24:43.030]  It truly is like...
[24:43.030 --> 24:44.350]  I'm learning a lot about my wife through this podcast.
[24:44.630 --> 24:46.730]  Like, she's only attracted to Jesse Eisenberg.
[24:46.850 --> 24:47.510]  No, I'm not!
[24:47.770 --> 24:53.310]  If I had to think of a nerdy witch boy to cast in a part, that was who I'd cast as.
[24:53.310 --> 24:54.730]  Right, but you could make him hot.
[24:55.150 --> 24:55.270]  No!
[24:55.730 --> 24:56.270]  Well, no, wait.
[24:56.330 --> 24:57.570]  Who did...
[24:57.570 --> 24:59.690]  Barbara Kingwood said Michael Cera would have been better.
[24:59.690 --> 25:00.290]  Michael Cera...
[25:00.830 --> 25:01.810]  They're the same to me!
[25:01.830 --> 25:03.010]  ...is marginally better.
[25:03.010 --> 25:03.530]  Is he better?
[25:03.710 --> 25:04.850]  They are the same person.
[25:05.130 --> 25:05.250]  No.
[25:05.250 --> 25:09.810]  But when I had to cast, like, a super hot mobster dude, Tom Hardy.
[25:10.430 --> 25:10.830]  Love it.
[25:10.830 --> 25:11.870]  It took her a while to get there.
[25:12.030 --> 25:15.410]  Yeah, because all I could do was look at the photo of you in your office and just...
[25:15.410 --> 25:16.470]  I couldn't think of anybody else.
[25:16.490 --> 25:19.650]  Yeah, speaking of super hot dudes like Geoff, cast on Brugman.
[25:19.750 --> 25:20.730]  Yeah, Brugman!
[25:21.070 --> 25:23.410]  He plays for Herbalife Nutrition.
[25:23.530 --> 25:24.910]  Plays for the LA Galaxy.
[25:25.130 --> 25:27.230]  Juan Mascuera, he plays for Alaska Airlines.
[25:27.630 --> 25:28.270]  It's Portland.
[25:28.870 --> 25:31.770]  Minnesota United, the whole team are Target employees.
[25:32.050 --> 25:33.930]  They are. That is, like, that's, like, their thing.
[25:34.370 --> 25:36.810]  Ryan Gold plays for Ma Bell.
[25:37.310 --> 25:38.390]  He's got the ill communication.
[25:39.190 --> 25:40.030]  Oh, here we go.
[25:40.030 --> 25:40.810]  Here's Evander.
[25:41.570 --> 25:43.070]  He plays for Alaska Airlines as well.
[25:43.170 --> 25:45.070]  This is some sort of a parallel.
[25:45.390 --> 25:46.290]  This is a...
[25:46.430 --> 25:48.070]  I just want to get some Austin FC guys. Let's see.
[25:48.150 --> 25:49.010]  Pitch Prodigies.
[25:50.290 --> 25:51.010]  Obed Vargas.
[25:51.670 --> 25:52.210]  And then Cesar...
[25:52.210 --> 25:54.070]  Sporting Kansas City. Keep going.
[25:54.090 --> 25:55.070]  He plays for Orlando Health.
[25:55.070 --> 25:55.410]  Some more of these.
[25:55.790 --> 25:58.390]  The season starts at the end of the month, man. I'm getting pumped.
[25:58.610 --> 25:59.730]  Do you think... what year are these?
[26:00.010 --> 26:00.790]  Probably last year.
[26:01.770 --> 26:03.850]  2023, so maybe. Maybe they'll have some.
[26:05.250 --> 26:05.970]  Matko Miljevic.
[26:06.110 --> 26:06.870]  See, our bad team.
[26:06.870 --> 26:08.070]  He plays for BMO.
[26:08.930 --> 26:10.130]  Matai Akinbono.
[26:10.570 --> 26:12.170]  He plays for XTC Network.
[26:12.770 --> 26:15.210]  Marco Angulo of the Mercury Health Clinic.
[26:16.090 --> 26:18.370]  Paxton Pomikol plays for MavQ.
[26:18.550 --> 26:20.870]  It's... appeared to be some sort of QAnon adjacent.
[26:22.330 --> 26:23.410]  Mikhail Urey.
[26:23.610 --> 26:24.190]  He's a rookie.
[26:24.770 --> 26:26.570]  I can't tell who he plays for.
[26:27.210 --> 26:29.570]  Thomas Williams also plays for the Health Organization.
[26:29.870 --> 26:32.350]  And then Efren Alvarez.
[26:33.150 --> 26:35.650]  Not a lot of... I wanted some Austin FC guys here, bud.
[26:35.670 --> 26:36.190]  I want to see some...
[26:36.190 --> 26:38.030]  You mean the Yeti team?
[26:38.290 --> 26:38.690]  Yeah, baby.
[26:38.890 --> 26:39.770]  Miguel Perez.
[26:39.790 --> 26:40.950]  He plays for Purina.
[26:41.290 --> 26:41.410]  Okay.
[26:42.630 --> 26:44.650]  Steven S. Swerada.
[26:44.990 --> 26:45.830]  He plays for Red Bull.
[26:46.090 --> 26:47.070]  He... he does.
[26:47.530 --> 26:49.010]  Georgios Koutsias.
[26:49.170 --> 26:49.650]  Can't tell.
[26:51.190 --> 26:51.970]  Charles Gill.
[26:52.830 --> 26:53.790]  Miles Robinson.
[26:54.610 --> 26:55.630]  And then Sergio N'Goma.
[26:57.170 --> 26:57.910]  I'm not seeing...
[26:57.910 --> 26:59.230]  I want some Austin FC guys.
[26:59.290 --> 26:59.630]  Come on.
[26:59.670 --> 27:00.510]  What are we doing here?
[27:00.610 --> 27:01.090]  All right, here we go.
[27:01.170 --> 27:01.950]  Here we go.
[27:02.230 --> 27:03.210]  This dude again.
[27:03.330 --> 27:03.870]  God damn it.
[27:04.690 --> 27:05.650]  Roman Berkey.
[27:06.050 --> 27:06.870]  Victor Wanyama.
[27:08.030 --> 27:08.130]  Close.
[27:08.890 --> 27:09.950]  Wrong sport, wrong name.
[27:10.530 --> 27:12.670]  Kit Core from Sebastian Blanco.
[27:13.010 --> 27:14.930]  A lot of Portland Timbers in this.
[27:15.250 --> 27:15.730]  BMO.
[27:15.930 --> 27:16.310]  Jesus.
[27:16.710 --> 27:17.150]  The Poog.
[27:18.210 --> 27:18.930]  Oh, and a...
[27:18.930 --> 27:19.390]  A Poog.
[27:19.570 --> 27:20.050]  Of course.
[27:20.210 --> 27:21.210]  A lot of Galaxy too.
[27:21.850 --> 27:22.290]  Let's see.
[27:23.050 --> 27:24.030]  Am I going to be able to help you?
[27:25.410 --> 27:26.290]  We got something?
[27:26.430 --> 27:26.730]  We'll see.
[27:26.870 --> 27:27.170]  All right.
[27:27.310 --> 27:27.710]  Maybe.
[27:27.890 --> 27:28.170]  Maybe.
[27:28.610 --> 27:29.050]  Here we go.
[27:29.130 --> 27:29.870]  Lucho Acosta.
[27:30.090 --> 27:30.350]  Okay.
[27:31.690 --> 27:33.330]  Lucas Zelorayan.
[27:33.550 --> 27:34.490]  Uh-huh.
[27:35.610 --> 27:37.030]  Joseph Martinez.
[27:37.590 --> 27:39.230]  He plays for XBTQ.
[27:39.330 --> 27:39.570]  Okay.
[27:39.750 --> 27:40.170]  Bankerson.
[27:40.890 --> 27:42.170]  Jack McGlynn.
[27:42.270 --> 27:42.970]  He's a Bimbo.
[27:44.830 --> 27:46.470]  Brian Oheda.
[27:47.570 --> 27:47.790]  Okay.
[27:48.150 --> 27:48.970]  And...
[27:49.990 --> 27:55.010]  Chip Keller with the soccer ball parallel rookie card.
[27:55.330 --> 27:57.070]  What the hell?
[27:57.410 --> 27:58.070]  Go Yeti.
[27:58.190 --> 28:00.030]  That's the worst one to get.
[28:00.330 --> 28:01.970]  Yeah, but it's a parallel, dude.
[28:02.030 --> 28:02.530]  He's got a...
[28:03.110 --> 28:03.630]  He...
[28:03.630 --> 28:06.370]  He had such a bad year last year.
[28:06.390 --> 28:06.970]  Oh, no.
[28:07.570 --> 28:08.490]  Like, I don't...
[28:08.490 --> 28:11.290]  I don't know if Chip Keller's still on our team.
[28:12.770 --> 28:17.730]  The Austin FC went unbeaten in the six matches Keller appeared as a 2022 rookie.
[28:17.890 --> 28:18.230]  Right.
[28:18.250 --> 28:18.710]  Right, right.
[28:19.150 --> 28:20.590]  As a 2022 rookie.
[28:20.930 --> 28:21.090]  Yeah.
[28:21.270 --> 28:21.470]  Yeah.
[28:21.470 --> 28:22.070]  How was his...
[28:22.070 --> 28:23.190]  How was his 2023?
[28:23.510 --> 28:24.350]  Sophomore season.
[28:24.810 --> 28:26.450]  He did bad.
[28:26.670 --> 28:26.710]  Bad.
[28:26.710 --> 28:28.610]  Did he do as bad as Diego Rubio?
[28:28.950 --> 28:30.310]  Or Martin Oheda?
[28:30.310 --> 28:30.590]  Okay.
[28:30.810 --> 28:34.210]  What about Christian Benteke, numbered to 99?
[28:34.510 --> 28:34.950]  Hey!
[28:35.430 --> 28:36.250]  It's pretty cool.
[28:36.410 --> 28:36.830]  That's cool.
[28:37.150 --> 28:38.990]  What about Sebastian Ferreira?
[28:39.130 --> 28:40.010]  He's a pitch prodigy.
[28:40.330 --> 28:41.650]  Daniel Gazdag.
[28:42.270 --> 28:42.890]  He's a bimbo.
[28:43.190 --> 28:44.430]  And Kai Wagner.
[28:44.790 --> 28:45.290]  He's also...
[28:45.290 --> 28:45.550]  There you go.
[28:45.690 --> 28:46.070]  A bimbo.
[28:46.350 --> 28:46.830]  The...
[28:47.810 --> 28:52.810]  The chat was just catching up to the Keller card, and everyone was having a nice laugh
[28:52.810 --> 28:53.210]  about it.
[28:53.270 --> 28:53.650]  Oh, thanks.
[28:53.650 --> 28:53.950]  Yeah.
[28:54.950 --> 28:55.430]  Cool.
[28:55.570 --> 28:55.870]  Parallel.
[28:56.170 --> 28:56.830]  That was...
[28:56.830 --> 28:58.470]  I mean, that was a cool card.
[28:58.470 --> 28:58.730]  I wish...
[28:58.730 --> 28:59.590]  Yeah, just the wrong guy.
[28:59.690 --> 28:59.850]  Yeah.
[28:59.950 --> 29:00.010]  Right?
[29:00.250 --> 29:00.410]  Yeah.
[29:00.690 --> 29:01.750]  I wish I would have been...
[29:01.750 --> 29:03.710]  I think he's in Austin right now, and he's like, I'm going to find Eric Medora.
[29:03.750 --> 29:04.230]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[29:04.310 --> 29:05.650]  I'm going to tell him what for.
[29:05.710 --> 29:06.370]  He's a round rock guy.
[29:06.650 --> 29:07.910]  And then he's going to go...
[29:08.290 --> 29:09.610]  And we have ins with that team, too.
[29:09.810 --> 29:09.930]  Yeah.
[29:10.010 --> 29:11.370]  He's going to call up Jack, his buddy Jack.
[29:11.470 --> 29:11.970]  I really...
[29:11.970 --> 29:13.070]  I love Austin FC.
[29:13.450 --> 29:14.670]  Nick Neal is my guy, baby.
[29:14.950 --> 29:15.890]  But I think he's not on our team.
[29:15.930 --> 29:17.470]  Jack oils down the players.
[29:17.610 --> 29:17.950]  He does.
[29:18.010 --> 29:20.730]  He gets in there, and he gets hands-on with, uh...
[29:20.730 --> 29:20.910]  Yeah.
[29:21.030 --> 29:22.690]  With Stu...
[29:22.690 --> 29:25.570]  He's always like, hey, Stu, man, you want me to come over and work out your glutes?
[29:25.710 --> 29:26.550]  Are you tensing up?
[29:26.710 --> 29:27.290]  I can help you out.
[29:27.290 --> 29:27.950]  How's your calf?
[29:28.030 --> 29:28.770]  I'm Jack.
[29:28.930 --> 29:29.270]  Yeah.
[29:29.530 --> 29:33.970]  And y'all think that the books we're talking about where they do that is wrong?
[29:34.030 --> 29:36.030]  Well, Geoff has written one, so...
[29:36.030 --> 29:36.670]  Yeah, what's that?
[29:36.670 --> 29:37.550]  How's that coming along?
[29:37.670 --> 29:37.970]  I wonder what it is.
[29:37.970 --> 29:42.110]  I had to postpone it because Gavin and I had to film something for him.
[29:42.630 --> 29:45.650]  I was helping him out at the time that we were going to write porn.
[29:45.890 --> 29:46.250]  Because...
[29:46.250 --> 29:48.090]  And then when you were filming, did you take a tumble?
[29:50.430 --> 29:51.750]  That's main podcast talk.
[29:51.750 --> 29:52.810]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:52.810 --> 29:53.530]  We saved that for later.
[29:53.550 --> 29:56.210]  The important thing is, is look, I'm not nobler.
[29:56.450 --> 29:58.630]  That the image was pulled from Instagram.
[29:59.270 --> 30:00.170]  No more blood.
[30:00.170 --> 30:03.530]  I have my first image ever removed from Instagram from being too graphic.
[30:04.690 --> 30:05.090]  Here we go.
[30:05.150 --> 30:05.630]  Chris Paul.
[30:06.730 --> 30:07.450]  He's, uh...
[30:07.450 --> 30:08.210]  He should probably retire.
[30:08.470 --> 30:08.710]  Really?
[30:08.850 --> 30:09.650]  He should probably think about retiring.
[30:09.710 --> 30:11.050]  Is he... didn't he go to Golden State?
[30:11.250 --> 30:13.530]  Yeah, he plays for... well, he doesn't play for Golden State, but he's there.
[30:13.990 --> 30:14.970]  He's hurt right now.
[30:15.010 --> 30:15.850]  He's on the...
[30:15.850 --> 30:19.690]  Every time they show Steph Curry, the only time you just see highlights and it's him.
[30:20.330 --> 30:20.830]  So upset.
[30:20.830 --> 30:21.290]  Yeah.
[30:21.890 --> 30:25.330]  Well, he's having to fucking move mountains to get that team across the 500 finish line.
[30:25.690 --> 30:25.870]  Yep.
[30:26.290 --> 30:28.850]  Josh Giddey, global reach.
[30:29.290 --> 30:29.730]  We like him.
[30:30.550 --> 30:30.830]  Mmm.
[30:30.950 --> 30:31.190]  Right?
[30:31.770 --> 30:33.590]  Isn't he the Timothee Chalamet-looking guy?
[30:33.630 --> 30:33.790]  Yeah.
[30:34.150 --> 30:36.650]  He's the one that the police are not prosecuting.
[30:36.930 --> 30:37.250]  Yeah.
[30:37.750 --> 30:40.450]  They decided not to further... they closed the investigation.
[30:40.490 --> 30:41.770]  They said, that's enough.
[30:42.330 --> 30:43.150]  We didn't do anything wrong.
[30:43.190 --> 30:44.670]  Oh, that's the Oklahoma City guy.
[30:44.890 --> 30:45.050]  Yeah.
[30:45.370 --> 30:45.830]  Oh!
[30:46.050 --> 30:48.230]  With the 16, 15-year-old girl.
[30:48.310 --> 30:49.290]  With Livvy Dunn.
[30:49.470 --> 30:49.710]  Yeah.
[30:49.710 --> 30:50.510]  Who is that?
[30:50.710 --> 30:51.010]  Kevin Garnett.
[30:51.610 --> 30:51.930]  Yeah.
[30:52.190 --> 30:53.610]  Dante DiVincenzo.
[30:53.870 --> 30:54.930]  I'm not part of this conversation.
[30:55.230 --> 30:59.190]  Baby Gronk finished rizzing up Livvy Dunn and then moved on.
[30:59.710 --> 31:00.630]  And here we are.
[31:01.490 --> 31:02.990]  And we will not be prosecuted.
[31:03.990 --> 31:05.790]  I don't know what y'all are talking about.
[31:06.230 --> 31:07.730]  Tyrese Maxey.
[31:07.870 --> 31:08.490]  I feel bad for him.
[31:09.550 --> 31:15.690]  Because he's really, really good and he should be really just soaring this year.
[31:15.690 --> 31:20.130]  But then fucking Dudu and Bede got hurt and now they're dog shit.
[31:20.210 --> 31:23.450]  And they're making a bunch of desperation trades to try to cobble together a postseason.
[31:23.590 --> 31:23.970]  Is he done?
[31:24.630 --> 31:24.990]  This year?
[31:25.150 --> 31:25.990]  They say he might be back.
[31:26.170 --> 31:27.570]  He might be back right around the time of the playoffs.
[31:27.750 --> 31:28.830]  I wouldn't expect it.
[31:28.890 --> 31:29.090]  Yeah.
[31:29.190 --> 31:33.610]  Because even if he comes back, a guy that big, he's going to take a while to get back into playing shape anyway.
[31:34.010 --> 31:35.430]  And you don't want to be going through that in the playoffs.
[31:35.530 --> 31:36.290]  So who knows?
[31:36.690 --> 31:37.250]  Tyler Harrow.
[31:37.550 --> 31:38.650]  Green prism parallel.
[31:39.590 --> 31:41.490]  That is my most despised player in the NBA.
[31:41.550 --> 31:42.910]  Interesting thing about Tyler Harrow.
[31:42.950 --> 31:43.110]  Oh.
[31:44.510 --> 31:47.050]  Andrew has decided he's got the most punchable face in the NBA.
[31:47.270 --> 31:47.490]  100%.
[31:47.490 --> 31:47.650]  I agree.
[31:47.810 --> 31:47.930]  Yeah.
[31:48.030 --> 31:48.290]  Totally agree.
[31:48.490 --> 31:48.610]  Yeah.
[31:49.990 --> 31:51.010]  Interesting thing about Tyler Harrow.
[31:51.610 --> 31:53.530]  He played the Celtics just yesterday.
[31:53.710 --> 31:53.830]  Yeah.
[31:54.490 --> 31:55.710]  Got his dick pushed in.
[31:55.870 --> 31:56.970]  Celtics beat the shit out of them.
[31:57.290 --> 31:57.650]  Fuck him.
[31:58.050 --> 31:58.430]  Celtics won.
[31:58.970 --> 31:59.290]  That's all.
[31:59.490 --> 31:59.950]  That's the interesting fact.
[31:59.950 --> 32:02.090]  Did he uppercut Porzingis' dick or what?
[32:02.130 --> 32:02.830]  No, that was Dan Montalbano.
[32:02.950 --> 32:03.270]  Oh, okay.
[32:03.390 --> 32:04.330]  He would give him the old...
[32:04.890 --> 32:06.950]  It was the one that I hate on...
[32:06.950 --> 32:07.990]  You don't like Duncan Robinson.
[32:08.650 --> 32:09.370]  Golden State.
[32:09.590 --> 32:10.370]  Oh, in Golden State?
[32:10.370 --> 32:11.890]  I want to punch him in the stupid face.
[32:11.890 --> 32:12.890]  You don't like Klay Thompson.
[32:12.950 --> 32:13.530]  I don't like Klay Thompson.
[32:13.590 --> 32:14.390]  That's a punchable face.
[32:14.890 --> 32:15.870]  Boney Bates rookie.
[32:16.090 --> 32:17.030]  We're talking about cool players.
[32:17.150 --> 32:17.710]  We're talking about Draymond.
[32:18.290 --> 32:18.650]  Buffalo.
[32:18.750 --> 32:20.170]  We're talking about someone who's doing the punching.
[32:20.810 --> 32:21.710]  That's a base Buffalo.
[32:22.050 --> 32:22.850]  By the way, I haven't looked at...
[32:22.850 --> 32:23.890]  Look at how serious...
[32:24.830 --> 32:25.550]  He's like...
[32:25.550 --> 32:26.490]  Get a good card.
[32:29.310 --> 32:30.610]  Dude, I'm a Bucs guy.
[32:31.810 --> 32:33.130]  I'm with the Bucs now.
[32:33.210 --> 32:33.750]  You're a Pat Bev Bucs guy?
[32:34.250 --> 32:35.730]  I'm all in on Pat Bev.
[32:35.790 --> 32:36.230]  Let's go.
[32:36.350 --> 32:37.090]  Zach Levine.
[32:37.290 --> 32:39.090]  Here's a silver DeMar DeRozan.
[32:39.210 --> 32:41.870]  I can't fucking believe he still plays for the Bulls.
[32:41.870 --> 32:43.570]  Just wasting a career.
[32:43.690 --> 32:43.850]  Yep.
[32:44.010 --> 32:44.890]  Devin Booker.
[32:45.070 --> 32:45.850]  Silver Cracked Ice.
[32:45.910 --> 32:47.090]  That's a cool card.
[32:48.270 --> 32:49.010]  Grant Williams.
[32:49.350 --> 32:49.950]  Wrong team.
[32:50.770 --> 32:51.710]  He's two teams...
[32:51.710 --> 32:52.410]  That's two teams to go.
[32:52.630 --> 32:55.350]  He plays for Charlotte as of last week.
[32:55.550 --> 32:56.710]  I feel bad for Grant.
[32:57.190 --> 32:58.850]  He didn't work out in Dallas.
[32:59.150 --> 32:59.870]  And it's apparently...
[33:00.610 --> 33:01.710]  They traded him at the trade deadline.
[33:02.230 --> 33:05.130]  All accounts are that he wasn't a good fit culturally.
[33:05.590 --> 33:06.010]  Really?
[33:06.310 --> 33:06.510]  Yeah.
[33:06.630 --> 33:08.970]  The rub on Grant Williams is that he talks too much...
[33:08.970 --> 33:09.370]  and he's annoying.
[33:10.270 --> 33:12.090]  But everybody on the Celtics kind of loved him.
[33:12.210 --> 33:12.930]  Like a little brother.
[33:13.110 --> 33:13.290]  Yeah.
[33:13.410 --> 33:15.570]  But he doesn't have that on a new team.
[33:16.030 --> 33:16.750]  That's tough.
[33:17.190 --> 33:17.790]  Jalen Green.
[33:17.990 --> 33:18.390]  Tough.
[33:19.170 --> 33:19.970]  Steve Nash.
[33:20.290 --> 33:20.670]  Yeah!
[33:21.030 --> 33:22.470]  I wish his body hadn't broken down.
[33:22.530 --> 33:23.370]  He was so much fun to watch.
[33:23.410 --> 33:23.870]  Great passer.
[33:24.250 --> 33:24.650]  Oh!
[33:26.470 --> 33:27.530]  Malakai Brannum-based.
[33:27.630 --> 33:28.610]  That's not what I'm saying 0 for.
[33:28.710 --> 33:31.430]  What I'm saying 0 for is the...
[33:32.870 --> 33:33.270]  Prism...
[33:33.270 --> 33:34.430]  Instant impact.
[33:34.970 --> 33:35.370]  Oh!
[33:36.550 --> 33:36.950]  Wendy!
[33:37.790 --> 33:38.470]  Pretty cool.
[33:38.470 --> 33:39.910]  Dunk on him, baby!
[33:40.130 --> 33:41.110]  These are usually uglier.
[33:41.410 --> 33:41.930]  It's not so ugly.
[33:41.950 --> 33:42.730]  That's a cool card.
[33:42.910 --> 33:44.030]  This is technically a prism.
[33:44.310 --> 33:45.350]  And it's a...
[33:45.350 --> 33:46.630]  So we should send that one off too?
[33:46.970 --> 33:47.190]  Maybe.
[33:47.550 --> 33:47.930]  Yeah.
[33:48.190 --> 33:48.430]  Fuck it.
[33:48.510 --> 33:48.670]  Why not?
[33:49.930 --> 33:50.590]  Fuck it.
[33:50.730 --> 33:53.110]  You check our eBay account and as soon as we get it open...
[33:53.110 --> 33:53.830]  It's only money.
[33:55.790 --> 33:56.550]  Spencer Dinwiddie.
[33:57.330 --> 33:58.370]  Here's a skewed Henderson.
[33:58.930 --> 33:59.650]  Jury's still out.
[33:59.690 --> 34:00.570]  I thought it said emergency.
[34:02.370 --> 34:04.530]  It's a bit of an emergency on its shooting efficiency.
[34:05.350 --> 34:06.810]  DeAndre Jordan cracked ice.
[34:07.090 --> 34:07.890]  We didn't do values.
[34:08.370 --> 34:08.950]  I did.
[34:09.030 --> 34:09.790]  I just did the...
[34:09.790 --> 34:10.370]  Only that one?
[34:10.390 --> 34:10.830]  That one card.
[34:10.950 --> 34:12.870]  It was the only one worth mentioning.
[34:13.770 --> 34:14.490]  Kobe Bufkin.
[34:14.690 --> 34:16.130]  He's got the coolest little hair.
[34:16.670 --> 34:17.270]  Did he go to UT?
[34:17.470 --> 34:17.790]  Knots.
[34:18.270 --> 34:18.510]  Oh!
[34:18.830 --> 34:21.050]  No, he's just letting everyone know he's calling the play.
[34:21.230 --> 34:21.930]  Oh, he's rocking on?
[34:22.030 --> 34:22.670]  Yeah, he's not...
[34:22.670 --> 34:24.590]  He's putting the horns up, but it's not for UT.
[34:24.990 --> 34:25.690]  If he did...
[34:25.690 --> 34:25.950]  Okay.
[34:26.130 --> 34:26.310]  All right.
[34:26.390 --> 34:27.330]  Gracie says, never mind.
[34:27.430 --> 34:27.650]  It is.
[34:27.870 --> 34:30.510]  Our resident UT said yes.
[34:32.030 --> 34:33.790]  Okay, well, that was fun.
[34:34.010 --> 34:35.050]  When we go through these cards...
[34:35.050 --> 34:35.670]  I think people don't know.
[34:35.670 --> 34:37.910]  Mike Purtle's not here today, but when...
[34:37.910 --> 34:39.730]  Oh, I was waiting for Mike to say if it wasn't.
[34:39.870 --> 34:45.150]  Mike's not here today, and every time there's a UT player, any sport that we open a card for,
[34:45.590 --> 34:47.750]  we can't see him, but I know he's back there going...
[34:48.630 --> 34:49.590]  Just every time.
[34:49.610 --> 34:50.730]  I'll see a little hand come up.
[34:51.710 --> 34:52.950]  He's always just putting them up.
[34:53.190 --> 34:56.150]  Next thing, Emily, I went to the store today, and I got a little present for you.
[34:56.230 --> 34:57.570]  For me? Because it was my birthday this weekend?
[34:57.650 --> 34:58.570]  Got you a...
[34:58.570 --> 34:59.510]  There's a cutie cup!
[35:00.490 --> 35:01.470]  Oh, cutie cup.
[35:01.730 --> 35:03.030]  Now, who is it we're looking for?
[35:03.090 --> 35:03.770]  It's the cat.
[35:04.050 --> 35:04.730]  I want Marie.
[35:04.730 --> 35:05.810]  You want Marie? There she is.
[35:07.110 --> 35:08.850]  That's going to be my hand someday.
[35:14.350 --> 35:15.730]  That's a good one, too.
[35:17.290 --> 35:18.150]  It's not her.
[35:18.310 --> 35:18.730]  What is it?
[35:18.790 --> 35:19.310]  Is it Nemo?
[35:20.250 --> 35:22.530]  Oh, it's Tigger.
[35:22.890 --> 35:23.870]  It's not Tigger.
[35:23.950 --> 35:25.230]  Oh, no, it's not Tigger. It's Rajah.
[35:25.290 --> 35:26.610]  Rajah from Jasmine.
[35:27.170 --> 35:27.610]  That's right.
[35:28.170 --> 35:28.970]  That's cute.
[35:29.170 --> 35:29.330]  Yeah.
[35:30.010 --> 35:32.250]  They can hang out with the big little thing.
[35:32.470 --> 35:33.470]  Big Hero 6 or whatever?
[35:34.490 --> 35:35.770]  That's pretty cool. You look powerful.
[35:35.870 --> 35:38.170]  Well, you didn't get it this time, but maybe next week.
[35:38.270 --> 35:38.970]  Better luck next time.
[35:39.450 --> 35:40.830]  Also, I got you a special...
[35:42.870 --> 35:44.050]  Disney Creepy Cuffs.
[35:44.190 --> 35:45.010]  They're villains.
[35:45.910 --> 35:46.570]  Creepy Cuffs.
[35:46.770 --> 35:47.830]  Yeah, you get Ursula.
[35:48.330 --> 35:49.190]  Who else would be on that?
[35:49.190 --> 35:50.050]  It's for evil little kids.
[35:51.930 --> 35:53.350]  For evil adult women.
[35:53.610 --> 35:55.290]  I want to be a super villain when I grow up.
[35:55.830 --> 35:56.610]  Okay, who do you think it is?
[35:57.290 --> 35:57.870]  This one.
[35:58.250 --> 35:58.950]  Oh, it's Cruella de Vil.
[35:59.270 --> 36:00.350]  Oh, wow, that's a...
[36:00.350 --> 36:01.290]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[36:01.350 --> 36:02.190]  Who else can we get?
[36:02.210 --> 36:03.230]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:03.230 --> 36:03.850]  You're right, you're right, you're right.
[36:04.070 --> 36:05.490]  I want to see who it could be.
[36:05.710 --> 36:07.850]  All right, here's who we can pull in future...
[36:07.850 --> 36:09.050]  Tracy wants to know so bad.
[36:10.270 --> 36:17.570]  Cruella, Ursula, Ed, Shere Khan, Evil Queen, Scar.
[36:17.910 --> 36:18.790]  Yep, Hades.
[36:18.890 --> 36:22.390]  Hades, Maleficent, and then that's it.
[36:22.450 --> 36:22.670]  Yep.
[36:22.870 --> 36:23.490]  Those are the bad guys.
[36:23.490 --> 36:24.210]  I like Ed.
[36:24.750 --> 36:25.450]  Yeah, Ed would be pretty good.
[36:25.450 --> 36:28.010]  He was like the dumb one of the hyenas, so he's fun.
[36:28.350 --> 36:29.230]  Wow, you look powerful.
[36:29.550 --> 36:29.830]  Yeah.
[36:30.010 --> 36:30.570]  That's pretty cool.
[36:31.150 --> 36:32.710]  I've got a cutie and a cruelly.
[36:32.710 --> 36:33.310]  Whoa!
[36:33.310 --> 36:34.210]  Cutie and a cruelly.
[36:35.490 --> 36:36.350]  Gracie wants these.
[36:37.650 --> 36:39.170]  I think this was her jacket.
[36:40.170 --> 36:42.010]  She had a yellow jacket when she was like a little crazy.
[36:42.230 --> 36:44.250]  Not the one that had like the long like tails on it.
[36:44.490 --> 36:46.870]  I think this was her, this looks like her driving face too.
[36:47.550 --> 36:47.990]  It was like, ah.
[36:48.450 --> 36:49.950]  Which is behind the wheel.
[36:50.070 --> 36:52.590]  Yeah, she's got like a cat killed his dogs.
[36:52.810 --> 36:53.910]  Let's focus on Alan and Ginter.
[36:54.030 --> 36:54.830]  We always loved up in those.
[36:54.890 --> 36:55.410]  Love them.
[36:55.950 --> 36:56.570]  Emily loves them.
[36:56.590 --> 37:00.490]  They're only our favorite cards and they'd become the best cards ever if they only featured
[37:00.490 --> 37:04.790]  someone who had started a major production company and...
[37:04.790 --> 37:05.910]  This guy again.
[37:06.010 --> 37:06.330]  Who we got?
[37:06.390 --> 37:06.770]  My hero.
[37:07.590 --> 37:08.010]  Oh, no.
[37:10.430 --> 37:11.790]  Jordan Groschan's rookie.
[37:11.990 --> 37:12.630]  How is there not...
[37:13.130 --> 37:18.590]  Hey, Blake Snell still hasn't signed with a team two times Cy Young award winner.
[37:18.790 --> 37:19.950]  Blake Snell has...
[37:19.950 --> 37:21.110]  Pitchers and Catchers reported.
[37:21.410 --> 37:22.450]  He has not signed a contract.
[37:22.730 --> 37:23.590]  I didn't realize he...
[37:23.590 --> 37:24.070]  Oh my God.
[37:24.550 --> 37:24.990]  Crazy.
[37:25.270 --> 37:26.450]  He wants like a 10 year deal.
[37:26.530 --> 37:27.010]  I think that's why.
[37:27.230 --> 37:28.170]  Evan Longoria.
[37:29.230 --> 37:30.070]  Relic card.
[37:30.070 --> 37:32.370]  Evan Longoria with the diamond backs, huh?
[37:32.530 --> 37:32.750]  Apparently.
[37:33.150 --> 37:33.210]  Weird.
[37:33.650 --> 37:35.470]  Here we have Galapagos Islands.
[37:35.750 --> 37:36.350]  That's cool.
[37:36.450 --> 37:36.890]  They're in Ecuador.
[37:37.310 --> 37:38.090]  No, my falcon.
[37:39.010 --> 37:42.270]  Oh, if only you had cutie cuffs on your...
[37:42.270 --> 37:43.390]  We can't...
[37:43.390 --> 37:44.610]  We have filmable falcons.
[37:44.910 --> 37:46.230]  Yeah, well, they're not...
[37:46.230 --> 37:50.230]  It's not Friday at whatever time they go on sale, so I can't have a falcon yet.
[37:50.490 --> 37:50.870]  10 a.m. Central.
[37:50.890 --> 37:54.970]  So until then, until 10 a.m. Central on Friday, I have to use my cutie cuffs on my collar.
[37:55.370 --> 37:58.070]  Falcon, attack the cutie cuffs.
[37:59.670 --> 38:00.390]  We gotta...
[38:00.390 --> 38:04.530]  Eric, if I were to say we have the prince of baseball, who would you say I'm?
[38:04.530 --> 38:04.970]  Prince Fielder?
[38:05.270 --> 38:06.890]  No, I'm talking about Ichiro.
[38:07.350 --> 38:07.690]  Oh.
[38:07.910 --> 38:10.450]  The other one-named baseball player.
[38:10.990 --> 38:12.050]  Oh, the prince of...
[38:12.050 --> 38:13.310]  Yeah, prince, like Prince Ichiro.
[38:13.310 --> 38:14.230]  No, I get that.
[38:14.290 --> 38:17.530]  When you said prince, I thought maybe it was the guy named Prince.
[38:17.670 --> 38:18.410]  Right, like Prince Fielder.
[38:18.530 --> 38:19.250]  No, that was really good.
[38:19.330 --> 38:19.470]  Thank you.
[38:19.470 --> 38:19.910]  That was really good.
[38:19.970 --> 38:20.630]  Appreciate that.
[38:21.090 --> 38:22.430]  I can see the confusion there too.
[38:23.170 --> 38:23.530]  What is that?
[38:23.530 --> 38:27.690]  Kebron Hayes, J Balvin, Justin Verlander.
[38:28.090 --> 38:29.830]  This was not from a specific game or event or year.
[38:29.830 --> 38:30.130]  Of course not.
[38:30.270 --> 38:30.790]  Dawn's Daily.
[38:31.170 --> 38:31.570]  Or player.
[38:31.930 --> 38:32.690]  Yeah, or anything.
[38:32.850 --> 38:34.190]  Kenny Lofton.
[38:34.310 --> 38:35.630]  Kenny Lofton with the Rangers, huh?
[38:35.750 --> 38:36.010]  Yeah.
[38:36.410 --> 38:38.630]  And then Greg Maddox with the Cubs.
[38:39.970 --> 38:40.590]  What is that?
[38:40.590 --> 38:42.090]  I can't escape that now.
[38:42.170 --> 38:42.970]  I don't know why.
[38:43.130 --> 38:44.530]  I don't know why that's...
[38:45.590 --> 38:46.550]  Like, what?
[38:46.790 --> 38:47.530]  I don't understand.
[38:48.150 --> 38:49.010]  Maybe I missed it.
[38:49.290 --> 38:52.290]  And I know it's been going on for a while, but why are we excited about this?
[38:52.290 --> 38:58.230]  In no world would I be like, Greg Maddox, the Chicago Cub.
[38:58.470 --> 38:59.750]  Hall of Fame baseball player.
[39:00.250 --> 39:02.650]  I just don't associate him with the Cubs.
[39:02.790 --> 39:04.290]  The Braves, 100%.
[39:05.190 --> 39:07.910]  He was on this pitching staff of the Braves.
[39:08.010 --> 39:10.250]  They had three Hall of Famers at the same time.
[39:10.350 --> 39:12.090]  It was him, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz.
[39:12.230 --> 39:15.910]  And they were just like the baddest pitching group of all time.
[39:16.450 --> 39:18.550]  And then he left and went to the Cubs and had a lot of success.
[39:18.690 --> 39:19.910]  He did. He had a lot of success.
[39:19.910 --> 39:23.910]  I would just never think of him as a Chicago Cub.
[39:23.910 --> 39:25.650]  It just doesn't click with me.
[39:25.710 --> 39:28.970]  He played 744 games.
[39:29.190 --> 39:30.310]  That's a lot of games.
[39:30.610 --> 39:31.150]  Grayson Rodriguez.
[39:31.730 --> 39:34.910]  I just don't know why it doesn't... I don't connect those dots in my head.
[39:35.110 --> 39:40.350]  Dang. He pitched 5,008 and one-third games.
[39:40.970 --> 39:41.210]  Innings.
[39:41.850 --> 39:42.190]  Innings.
[39:44.910 --> 39:47.810]  The eight and one-thirds threw me off.
[39:47.970 --> 39:48.790]  Hey, Dale Murphy.
[39:48.790 --> 39:54.150]  He struck out 3,371 people.
[39:54.270 --> 39:56.850]  Yeah. Hey, one of those people, not Tony Gwynn.
[39:56.890 --> 39:57.290]  That's true.
[39:57.470 --> 39:58.490]  He never struck him out?
[39:58.770 --> 39:59.250]  Never struck out.
[39:59.410 --> 40:00.990]  Here's the 10,000th loot we got.
[40:01.270 --> 40:01.750]  Yeah!
[40:02.470 --> 40:03.390]  And then Zach Granke.
[40:03.930 --> 40:06.110]  Oh, man. I think he's done. I think he retired.
[40:06.390 --> 40:06.570]  Really?
[40:06.790 --> 40:07.410]  I think he officially retired, yeah.
[40:08.050 --> 40:08.270]  Sad.
[40:08.530 --> 40:15.550]  Is there a major league baseball player who would be known who has never been struck out?
[40:16.290 --> 40:16.670]  No.
[40:16.730 --> 40:17.850]  No, everyone strikes out.
[40:17.850 --> 40:18.510]  Everybody strikes out.
[40:18.850 --> 40:19.170]  Yeah.
[40:20.230 --> 40:21.530]  That's right. Geofferson White.
[40:21.710 --> 40:23.150]  Tony Gwynn just does it so little, you know.
[40:23.210 --> 40:24.470]  I have no idea. That's a great question.
[40:24.490 --> 40:25.450]  Did he found a...
[40:25.450 --> 40:28.110]  He's an actor. He's in Yellowstone.
[40:28.570 --> 40:28.890]  Oh.
[40:29.110 --> 40:29.550]  There you go.
[40:29.650 --> 40:30.450]  Gracie loves that show.
[40:33.790 --> 40:34.430]  Javier Baez.
[40:35.570 --> 40:36.990]  She's a big Yellowstone fan.
[40:36.990 --> 40:38.470]  She loves Yellowstone. She's like, oh, Costner?
[40:38.730 --> 40:38.950]  Yeah.
[40:40.690 --> 40:45.450]  I don't know what I just got and what I'm about to show you guys, but it's going to be...
[40:45.450 --> 40:46.530]  I'm excited. That's cool. What do we got?
[40:46.530 --> 40:47.650]  We got Shane Bieber.
[40:47.890 --> 40:48.170]  Okay.
[40:48.410 --> 40:50.290]  Minnie. We got an enjoying a pina colada.
[40:50.470 --> 40:53.090]  To complete the collection.
[40:53.310 --> 40:54.350]  So that's actually pretty good.
[40:54.390 --> 40:54.710]  Nice.
[40:54.850 --> 40:55.550]  I'm trying to fill those out.
[40:55.590 --> 40:56.110]  I did that.
[40:56.110 --> 40:57.470]  And then we got...
[40:58.470 --> 40:59.990]  Okay. This is so stupid.
[41:00.730 --> 41:04.130]  We got a Benny Wasserman dressed up as...
[41:04.130 --> 41:04.430]  What?
[41:04.670 --> 41:04.970]  What?
[41:05.150 --> 41:06.290]  Who is that?
[41:06.630 --> 41:07.430]  He's an actor.
[41:07.710 --> 41:12.030]  So we got a relic card from Benny Wasserman, the actor.
[41:12.030 --> 41:16.370]  This is a genuine Topps Allen and Ginter relic card that features memorabilia from Benny Wasserman.
[41:16.590 --> 41:19.870]  I guess he is famous for acting as...
[41:22.510 --> 41:23.130]  Albert Einstein?
[41:23.650 --> 41:25.470]  Is he wearing like a Detroit jersey?
[41:25.750 --> 41:28.010]  Or is that just an old dude who looks like Albert Einstein?
[41:28.270 --> 41:30.010]  No, I think that that's just an actor.
[41:30.210 --> 41:31.090]  Who is he?
[41:31.250 --> 41:32.030]  I'm going to look him up.
[41:32.070 --> 41:32.610]  He's an actor.
[41:32.950 --> 41:33.150]  Okay.
[41:33.410 --> 41:36.430]  I think Geoff maybe just assumed that he plays Albert Einstein.
[41:36.730 --> 41:37.890]  He looks like Albert Einstein.
[41:38.170 --> 41:39.490]  So yeah, so he just guessed.
[41:39.490 --> 41:41.690]  Now, do you think...
[41:41.690 --> 41:46.090]  I could get some stuff from your closet and give to Allen and Ginter for relics.
[41:46.190 --> 41:46.890]  Yeah, we'll do that.
[41:46.950 --> 41:47.550]  You know, we've got...
[41:47.550 --> 41:51.050]  We could do like the jersey that you hit all the baseballs in.
[41:51.390 --> 41:52.490]  So many baseballs.
[41:53.150 --> 41:55.030]  He's gloved up with a bat.
[41:55.110 --> 41:56.410]  His name is Benny Wasserman?
[41:56.650 --> 41:56.890]  Yeah.
[41:58.230 --> 41:59.350]  Yeah, actor.
[41:59.970 --> 42:00.390]  Actor.
[42:00.530 --> 42:01.550]  TV the movie.
[42:03.550 --> 42:05.010]  Angels with angles.
[42:05.590 --> 42:05.990]  What?
[42:06.290 --> 42:08.730]  I don't... None of these are...
[42:08.730 --> 42:09.350]  Geoff, you should...
[42:09.350 --> 42:11.210]  This is why Geoff Ramsey needs a card.
[42:11.390 --> 42:12.130]  God damn it.
[42:12.170 --> 42:12.970]  Leave it to Beaver.
[42:13.730 --> 42:15.450]  He was in the Leave it to Beaver movie?
[42:16.550 --> 42:17.170]  Albert Einstein.
[42:18.230 --> 42:19.210]  I'm not joking.
[42:19.490 --> 42:21.670]  He played Albert Einstein in...
[42:21.670 --> 42:23.550]  Geoff, in like everything.
[42:24.010 --> 42:24.630]  You are right.
[42:25.510 --> 42:26.250]  Oh my God.
[42:26.510 --> 42:26.950]  That's...
[42:28.050 --> 42:28.930]  That's crazy.
[42:29.350 --> 42:30.570]  How did you do that?
[42:30.570 --> 42:31.530]  He's the go-to.
[42:31.830 --> 42:32.650]  And we fucking got it.
[42:32.910 --> 42:33.670]  What do you mean, how did I do it?
[42:33.710 --> 42:34.130]  Look at him.
[42:34.230 --> 42:35.850]  I went, oh, we got an Albert Einstein relic.
[42:36.010 --> 42:37.030]  Who the fuck is Wasserman?
[42:37.990 --> 42:38.470]  Wild.
[42:38.790 --> 42:39.270]  Incredible.
[42:39.510 --> 42:40.450]  I love it.
[42:40.450 --> 42:41.470]  That's going in the collection.
[42:41.670 --> 42:43.370]  1994 Upper Deck Baseball.
[42:43.670 --> 42:45.970]  I think I bought these in Michigan at a yard sale.
[42:46.050 --> 42:46.370]  Nice.
[42:46.590 --> 42:47.910]  Let's see what we got here.
[42:48.470 --> 42:49.390]  Luis Gonzalez.
[42:50.430 --> 42:51.350]  That's fucking nice.
[42:51.570 --> 42:52.190]  That's a cool card.
[42:52.190 --> 42:52.210]  That's a cool card.
[42:52.390 --> 42:53.570]  Oh, there's a good one.
[42:54.330 --> 42:55.290]  Ken Caminiti.
[42:55.530 --> 42:56.310]  Yeah, Cammy.
[42:56.390 --> 42:57.170]  With the Astros.
[42:57.650 --> 42:58.410]  That's a sup.
[42:58.530 --> 42:59.110]  That's a...
[42:59.110 --> 42:59.830]  That is a sup.
[42:59.830 --> 43:02.890]  That's a great San Diego Padre, Ken Caminiti.
[43:02.930 --> 43:03.570]  Geoff Juden.
[43:04.490 --> 43:05.930]  I guess it's a pussy sleigh.
[43:05.930 --> 43:07.270]  Yeah, there you go.
[43:07.590 --> 43:08.270]  Vince Coleman.
[43:08.530 --> 43:10.670]  Looking like he's hobbling, but he's a good, fast dude.
[43:11.790 --> 43:13.750]  That's you after you stub your toe on our bed frame.
[43:14.230 --> 43:15.030]  Randy Johnson.
[43:15.210 --> 43:16.410]  It looks like he's saying, huh?
[43:16.890 --> 43:17.150]  What?
[43:17.470 --> 43:17.870]  Huh?
[43:18.270 --> 43:19.210]  What year are these from?
[43:19.270 --> 43:19.510]  94.
[43:19.910 --> 43:20.310]  Wow.
[43:21.910 --> 43:22.710]  This is...
[43:22.710 --> 43:23.250]  Who is it, Falcon?
[43:23.470 --> 43:24.210]  Sean Barry.
[43:24.470 --> 43:24.730]  Oh, he's hidden.
[43:24.910 --> 43:25.930]  He's right here.
[43:25.990 --> 43:27.070]  He's keeping me safe.
[43:27.130 --> 43:28.030]  It's from my angle.
[43:28.170 --> 43:28.450]  I couldn't see.
[43:29.110 --> 43:29.510]  Sorry.
[43:30.130 --> 43:30.930]  Real Kormor.
[43:30.930 --> 43:32.370]  I'm waiting for it to not be protected.
[43:32.970 --> 43:33.310]  Ooh.
[43:35.430 --> 43:36.150]  David Justin.
[43:36.610 --> 43:37.670]  Another Brave Great.
[43:41.770 --> 43:42.490]  Armando Reynoso.
[43:42.870 --> 43:43.970]  I haven't thought about him in a long time.
[43:45.010 --> 43:48.110]  Here we have Armando Reynoso again.
[43:48.190 --> 43:48.550]  We got two of them.
[43:48.550 --> 43:49.510]  What the fuck?
[43:50.290 --> 43:51.250]  How did they do that?
[43:51.430 --> 43:51.750]  I don't know.
[43:51.830 --> 43:52.270]  That was pretty cool.
[43:52.330 --> 43:52.730]  Nice of them.
[43:52.810 --> 43:53.410]  Eric Anthony.
[43:53.870 --> 43:55.590]  That's like a diamond parallel.
[43:55.790 --> 43:56.170]  Look at that.
[43:56.930 --> 43:57.730]  That's kind of cool.
[43:57.810 --> 43:58.910]  That's worth so much money, dude.
[43:59.610 --> 44:00.450]  And then Jason Giambi.
[44:01.090 --> 44:02.250]  Top prospect rookie.
[44:03.310 --> 44:04.710]  We got a Jason Giambi rookie.
[44:04.810 --> 44:05.170]  That's cute.
[44:05.270 --> 44:05.810]  Let's leave that.
[44:05.970 --> 44:06.390]  That's pretty crazy.
[44:06.990 --> 44:07.930]  He was a good player.
[44:08.230 --> 44:08.570]  Yeah.
[44:09.210 --> 44:14.030]  I would say that he had some success with the A's and then he went to New York.
[44:14.730 --> 44:15.730]  He went to the Yankees.
[44:16.490 --> 44:17.410]  Did not have success.
[44:17.690 --> 44:19.270]  He hit the ball very hard.
[44:19.590 --> 44:21.270]  What season was Moneyball?
[44:21.750 --> 44:22.750]  Is he from then?
[44:23.750 --> 44:26.090]  It's a little bit early for that.
[44:27.130 --> 44:29.170]  Moneyball is after this because they got rid of Giambi.
[44:29.810 --> 44:31.550]  And then that's the big thing.
[44:31.690 --> 44:32.570]  Giambi is, I think, in them.
[44:33.070 --> 44:33.390]  Wow.
[44:33.630 --> 44:34.930]  It was right after they got rid of him.
[44:34.950 --> 44:35.270]  It was.
[44:35.430 --> 44:35.890]  It was right after.
[44:36.330 --> 44:36.450]  Cool.
[44:36.730 --> 44:37.530]  So right around Moneyball.
[44:38.310 --> 44:39.750]  Here's some of these 91 tops.
[44:39.810 --> 44:41.790]  These are just like the ones we got the box for.
[44:41.850 --> 44:41.990]  Yeah.
[44:42.570 --> 44:43.290]  So let's see what we got.
[44:43.350 --> 44:44.350]  We got Gary Wayne.
[44:45.050 --> 44:45.770]  Gary Wayne Gary.
[44:46.970 --> 44:50.230]  He was that priest in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.
[44:50.930 --> 44:51.610]  Oh, okay.
[44:51.790 --> 44:53.130]  He's the one that kept them underground.
[44:53.190 --> 44:53.610]  The actor was?
[44:54.030 --> 44:55.850]  That was the character's name was Gary Wayne Gary.
[44:55.870 --> 44:56.850]  The actor was Jon Hamm.
[44:57.170 --> 44:57.470]  That's right.
[44:57.750 --> 44:58.330]  Brian Downing.
[44:58.490 --> 44:59.350]  Kim Caminiti.
[44:59.630 --> 45:00.810]  Yeah, Cammy again.
[45:01.170 --> 45:01.990]  Luis Salazar.
[45:03.210 --> 45:04.090]  Scott Radinsky.
[45:05.690 --> 45:06.570]  Rick Dempsey.
[45:06.950 --> 45:08.030]  Dan Plezak.
[45:08.110 --> 45:08.990]  Jack Savage.
[45:10.450 --> 45:11.330]  Denny Martinez.
[45:13.370 --> 45:15.370]  This is going into some kind of a collection.
[45:16.470 --> 45:17.350]  Bob Melvin.
[45:17.630 --> 45:17.970]  Hey.
[45:18.190 --> 45:18.650]  He's having a think.
[45:18.990 --> 45:23.250]  That is former Padres manager, now Giants manager, Bob Melvin.
[45:23.330 --> 45:23.970]  He's having a thought.
[45:24.110 --> 45:25.190]  He's thinking about it.
[45:25.290 --> 45:26.250]  Pat Combs.
[45:26.330 --> 45:27.590]  Thinking about how he got himself into this mess.
[45:27.590 --> 45:28.150]  Jimmy Key.
[45:28.570 --> 45:31.970]  Oh, so close to being the right one, but it's his predecessor, Ramon Martinez.
[45:32.390 --> 45:32.710]  Oh.
[45:34.250 --> 45:34.890]  Bob Walk.
[45:35.530 --> 45:36.790]  And Kevin Elster.
[45:37.630 --> 45:37.950]  Cool.
[45:38.470 --> 45:43.090]  Now we're going to open up a pack of Goodwin champions and this pack of Topps Chrome Baseball.
[45:43.410 --> 45:46.210]  And then we're going to get into this heritage box.
[45:46.410 --> 45:47.090]  A little bit of that.
[45:47.850 --> 45:49.010]  So we had a poll.
[45:49.610 --> 45:51.130]  We had a poll and it's closed.
[45:51.210 --> 45:51.750]  And we did it.
[45:51.810 --> 45:55.510]  So I know who the winner is, but we can wait to get to it.
[45:55.570 --> 45:55.690]  All right.
[45:55.710 --> 45:56.310]  We'll wait till we get to it.
[45:56.410 --> 45:57.670]  Have you ever seen that movie, Drop Dead Gorgeous?
[45:58.070 --> 45:58.330]  Yeah.
[45:58.730 --> 45:59.490]  I know who the winner is.
[45:59.490 --> 46:00.730]  I know who the winner is.
[46:00.730 --> 46:02.330]  I know who the winner is.
[46:03.170 --> 46:05.010]  What a miner.
[46:06.310 --> 46:07.390]  This is so funny.
[46:07.530 --> 46:07.870]  But that's it.
[46:07.930 --> 46:09.750]  With your overall stuck in the truck.
[46:10.410 --> 46:11.030]  What's that dude's name?
[46:11.450 --> 46:11.870]  Will Sasso.
[46:11.890 --> 46:12.190]  Will Sasso.
[46:12.310 --> 46:14.530]  You know, we tried to hire him for Achievement Hunter for something.
[46:14.690 --> 46:14.950]  Really?
[46:15.130 --> 46:15.910]  I'll tell you a story real quick.
[46:16.270 --> 46:17.270]  So while we're opening these.
[46:17.330 --> 46:21.290]  Vida Blue, Ramon Lorano, Alex Rodriguez, A-Rod, and then Maury Willis.
[46:21.390 --> 46:21.490]  Okay.
[46:21.770 --> 46:27.890]  So we tried to hire him back in the day because he had this vine of him singing in the shower.
[46:28.150 --> 46:28.170]  Yeah.
[46:28.170 --> 46:35.370]  And that was in a thousand Achievement Hunter videos, us singing and making fun of that.
[46:35.570 --> 46:41.070]  So when we did the very first Let's Play Live in L.A., which was at the Grauman Theater.
[46:41.590 --> 46:42.810]  I don't know if it's called that still.
[46:43.090 --> 46:43.170]  I know.
[46:43.390 --> 46:43.910]  It's a Chinese theater.
[46:44.190 --> 46:44.330]  Yeah.
[46:44.670 --> 46:45.890]  It's where they do the Academy Awards.
[46:45.990 --> 46:47.510]  We did a live show where they did the Academy Awards.
[46:47.530 --> 46:48.210]  And Brent's out front.
[46:48.510 --> 46:53.130]  And we tried to hire him to come out and just sing that as an interstitial for five minutes.
[46:53.430 --> 46:56.230]  And we're like, we contacted his agent.
[46:56.430 --> 46:57.370]  We tried to contact him.
[46:57.370 --> 46:58.870]  I think he followed one of us for a little bit.
[46:58.930 --> 47:01.810]  So we tried to message him directly and just never got a response.
[47:01.890 --> 47:03.430]  And we were offering some money, too.
[47:03.510 --> 47:03.730]  Oh, bummer.
[47:03.970 --> 47:09.930]  And he just had to come out and go like, and then do like 30 seconds of him singing that song and then walk off.
[47:09.970 --> 47:10.910]  And we would have paid him.
[47:11.370 --> 47:12.590]  I mean, probably not big money for him.
[47:13.170 --> 47:13.970]  Big money for us.
[47:14.290 --> 47:14.430]  Damn.
[47:14.510 --> 47:15.810]  He was like, so not interested.
[47:16.210 --> 47:17.110]  Won't return the calls.
[47:17.310 --> 47:17.890]  Like, I don't know.
[47:17.950 --> 47:18.250]  Fuck with you.
[47:18.250 --> 47:20.450]  He does a great Jesse the Body Ventura impression.
[47:20.630 --> 47:21.610]  He's a funny dude.
[47:21.810 --> 47:21.930]  Yeah.
[47:22.030 --> 47:22.990]  He's also great in Happy Gilmore.
[47:23.170 --> 47:23.310]  Yeah.
[47:23.550 --> 47:24.230]  He's one of the movers.
[47:25.250 --> 47:25.890]  Fred Couples.
[47:26.990 --> 47:27.470]  Woof.
[47:27.530 --> 47:29.030]  That's my guy right there.
[47:29.390 --> 47:31.850]  That's that waste management right there.
[47:32.450 --> 47:33.830]  That's Fred Couples, huh?
[47:34.770 --> 47:36.330]  Maybe Fred Couple-less, man.
[47:36.410 --> 47:36.930]  I don't know.
[47:38.610 --> 47:39.090]  Wow.
[47:40.250 --> 47:41.210]  Anthony Richardson.
[47:41.650 --> 47:41.830]  Uh-huh.
[47:41.890 --> 47:42.150]  Hell yeah.
[47:42.630 --> 47:44.970]  Here's a Grady Dick Young Guns.
[47:45.150 --> 47:45.830]  That's cool.
[47:46.490 --> 47:46.990]  That's our boy.
[47:47.010 --> 47:48.710]  I didn't know they did Young Guns for other sports.
[47:48.730 --> 47:49.490]  That's a hockey thing.
[47:49.510 --> 47:50.510]  That's that baby dick.
[47:50.970 --> 47:51.210]  Okay.
[47:51.350 --> 47:51.830]  Baby dick.
[47:52.010 --> 47:52.250]  There you go.
[47:52.350 --> 47:53.150]  Gigi Jackson.
[47:53.410 --> 47:55.870]  He's getting a lot of play time for the fucking...
[47:55.870 --> 47:57.550]  Grizzlies right now, because everybody's hurt.
[47:57.770 --> 47:57.850]  Yeah.
[47:58.050 --> 47:59.810]  And then Bryce Young.
[48:00.010 --> 48:00.870]  Rough season, Bryce.
[48:01.010 --> 48:01.050]  Woo!
[48:01.050 --> 48:01.910]  Rough, rough season.
[48:02.510 --> 48:02.890]  All right.
[48:03.050 --> 48:07.610]  Dick had a very impressive first season at Kansas, as he set a school record for made
[48:07.610 --> 48:09.730]  three-pointers by a freshman with 83.
[48:10.110 --> 48:14.170]  He went four for five from beyond the arc, while scoring 20 points in the Jayhawks'
[48:14.610 --> 48:17.050]  whatever home win over the Indiana Hoosiers.
[48:17.270 --> 48:17.450]  Yep.
[48:17.830 --> 48:18.150]  That's our boy.
[48:18.150 --> 48:20.170]  I was watching a lot of Kobe highlights recently.
[48:20.430 --> 48:20.510]  Uh-huh.
[48:20.570 --> 48:24.210]  You know, the statues and everything, and just sort of got fed a bunch of them.
[48:24.210 --> 48:26.550]  That guy was such a fan of taking the long two.
[48:26.910 --> 48:28.010]  Like, he just...
[48:28.010 --> 48:30.210]  Take one more step back.
[48:30.810 --> 48:31.810]  What the fuck?
[48:31.870 --> 48:32.030]  Kobe.
[48:32.370 --> 48:35.050]  But that was the NBA at that time.
[48:35.390 --> 48:37.170]  Like, 2007 NBA is the long two.
[48:37.830 --> 48:38.690]  I don't buy this.
[48:39.290 --> 48:40.050]  This particular part.
[48:40.050 --> 48:40.290]  Me neither.
[48:40.390 --> 48:41.310]  I don't fucking get it.
[48:41.350 --> 48:41.810]  I don't buy it.
[48:43.050 --> 48:47.950]  So I was surprised to see that it was the number one selling card box across all sports.
[48:49.390 --> 48:54.530]  But I bought... I had Gracie get them, but I haven't had a chance to look at what the chase cards are.
[48:54.630 --> 48:56.510]  So I really don't know what we should even be looking for in this.
[48:56.510 --> 48:58.090]  Do you think it's because they're more available?
[48:58.270 --> 48:58.930]  So they're most selling?
[48:58.930 --> 49:02.050]  They're cheaper, but I think also people really love them.
[49:02.190 --> 49:03.070]  Like, they're very beloved.
[49:03.310 --> 49:03.990]  People love baseball.
[49:04.310 --> 49:05.110]  And baseball cards.
[49:05.290 --> 49:06.030]  Baseball's so much bigger.
[49:06.070 --> 49:09.350]  And, you know, pitchers and catchers reported, so there you go.
[49:09.770 --> 49:10.890]  So this is fucking cool.
[49:11.790 --> 49:12.150]  Alright.
[49:12.610 --> 49:14.910]  It's Claude Osteen, so I'm not familiar with Claude Osteen.
[49:15.050 --> 49:16.910]  Apparently a pitcher for the Houston Astros.
[49:16.910 --> 49:19.310]  But this is probably a buyback.
[49:19.790 --> 49:25.890]  So what they will do in some of these products is they will go and they'll collect old, actual old baseball cards.
[49:26.030 --> 49:26.910]  Like, this is...
[49:30.410 --> 49:30.810]  1973.
[49:31.270 --> 49:31.490]  Wow.
[49:31.610 --> 49:33.030]  This is a legitimate 1973 card.
[49:33.410 --> 49:33.970]  So they got it.
[49:33.990 --> 49:34.950]  You can see it's miscut.
[49:35.150 --> 49:38.830]  They collect them in good shape, and then they put the stamp on it and then resend them out.
[49:38.950 --> 49:40.170]  So this was just like a box topper.
[49:40.410 --> 49:45.650]  But this is actually from 1973 that they went and collected, brought it back, stamped it, and put it in a product.
[49:45.670 --> 49:46.130]  That's neat.
[49:46.130 --> 49:49.850]  If anyone from Topps wants some old shit, we've got a bunch hanging around.
[49:50.170 --> 49:51.410]  Put this in the sack pack?
[49:51.950 --> 49:53.170]  Yeah, we'll sell you some.
[49:53.590 --> 49:54.650]  How many of these are we getting into?
[49:54.890 --> 49:57.030]  We'll get into, like, I don't know, five minutes worth.
[49:57.090 --> 49:58.950]  And then we'll switch over to whatever the last thing is.
[49:59.170 --> 50:00.250]  However long that takes.
[50:01.850 --> 50:03.270]  I'm always paying more attention to time.
[50:03.270 --> 50:03.950]  I get it.
[50:04.490 --> 50:05.010]  I appreciate you.
[50:05.010 --> 50:06.090]  Alright, let's see what we got here.
[50:06.170 --> 50:06.870]  Victor Robles.
[50:08.110 --> 50:08.910]  Anthony Rendon.
[50:10.530 --> 50:11.330]  Roughnead Odor.
[50:11.810 --> 50:12.210]  Roughnead!
[50:13.030 --> 50:13.830]  Gregory Santos.
[50:13.830 --> 50:15.730]  You know why they did this one?
[50:15.890 --> 50:16.290]  This card?
[50:16.490 --> 50:16.570]  Why?
[50:16.790 --> 50:22.010]  Because this is bringing back the 1974 Topps design, so they're showing you what an original one looks like.
[50:22.010 --> 50:22.790]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[50:22.790 --> 50:23.210]  That's fucking brilliant.
[50:23.230 --> 50:24.310]  And that's very smart of you.
[50:24.470 --> 50:26.170]  Yeah, I fucking read the box, y'all.
[50:26.390 --> 50:26.810]  Boom!
[50:27.550 --> 50:28.310]  Roger Maris.
[50:28.410 --> 50:29.030]  Aaron Judge.
[50:29.550 --> 50:30.730]  Keep it to the podcast.
[50:31.610 --> 50:32.490]  Pablo Lopez.
[50:33.070 --> 50:33.870]  John Gomez.
[50:34.470 --> 50:35.870]  J.D. Martinez.
[50:36.590 --> 50:37.870]  And then Taylor Motter.
[50:37.990 --> 50:38.650]  Alright, let's see.
[50:40.130 --> 50:42.190]  A little bit more of these bad boys.
[50:42.190 --> 50:46.250]  I'm so excited for baseball getting started right now, and it's going to be...
[50:46.250 --> 50:46.590]  Kyle Gibson.
[50:46.830 --> 50:47.770]  Oh, dude, speaking of.
[50:47.930 --> 50:48.670]  Man, it's going to be crazy.
[50:48.930 --> 50:49.690]  Kyle Stevenson, rookie.
[50:51.010 --> 50:52.170]  Jose Hernandez, rookie.
[50:53.030 --> 50:53.730]  Dominique Fletcher.
[50:53.950 --> 50:54.350]  Fine.
[50:55.030 --> 50:55.710]  Sam Bachman.
[50:56.150 --> 50:56.730]  Dylan Dodd.
[50:57.250 --> 50:57.990]  Blake Perkins.
[50:58.090 --> 50:58.890]  They're all fucking rude.
[50:59.230 --> 51:02.910]  Didn't sign Shohei Otani for a lifetime contract.
[51:03.310 --> 51:05.030]  Defer all the payments to 2030.
[51:07.050 --> 51:08.850]  I don't worry about collecting any money.
[51:09.550 --> 51:11.310]  We'll be dead by the time we have to pay that bill.
[51:12.370 --> 51:16.370]  The 2030 Dodgers, like that decade, I'm really looking forward to when they have no money.
[51:16.490 --> 51:17.270]  It's going to be so awesome.
[51:17.430 --> 51:20.210]  Here's something I'm kind of excited about.
[51:22.330 --> 51:27.950]  Burndog, Trux Bernie, Vince Velasquez was telling me that out of all Shintaro Fujinami,
[51:28.030 --> 51:32.470]  out of all the sports, he thinks baseball is the one he could get into the most.
[51:32.510 --> 51:33.290]  Yeah, he was talking about that.
[51:33.450 --> 51:34.630]  He wants to get into baseball this year.
[51:34.790 --> 51:36.310]  He's going to come over on opening day.
[51:36.430 --> 51:37.670]  He wants to be a Tigers fan.
[51:37.810 --> 51:38.370]  Oh, cool.
[51:38.370 --> 51:40.470]  And so if you want to come over, we're going to watch the Tigers on opening day.
[51:40.470 --> 51:41.550]  I'll watch the Tigers, hell yeah.
[51:41.750 --> 51:42.210]  I would love...
[51:42.210 --> 51:43.150]  Go to the Tigers game.
[51:43.590 --> 51:46.930]  Bernie's one of those dudes, Burndog's one of those dudes, when he gets into something, he gets into it.
[51:47.030 --> 51:50.470]  Like, if you ever talk to him about metal, he could go for like 10 hours.
[51:50.610 --> 51:52.190]  And that's nothing compared to what he knows about painting.
[51:52.510 --> 51:56.990]  So him getting into baseball, I think he'll love it because it appeals to those kind of people.
[51:57.110 --> 52:02.730]  He was the bartender at Mohawk when a bunch of wrestling shows were happening there.
[52:02.790 --> 52:03.110]  Mason, yeah.
[52:03.170 --> 52:05.470]  We found out, like, we'd crossed paths there before.
[52:05.830 --> 52:07.570]  And he was, like, super into it.
[52:07.570 --> 52:08.390]  Oh, this is cool.
[52:08.510 --> 52:09.690]  Miguel, uh...
[52:09.690 --> 52:10.370]  This is a biggie card.
[52:10.450 --> 52:10.930]  Miguel Cabrera.
[52:11.410 --> 52:14.150]  April 23rd, 2022, his 3,000th hit.
[52:15.090 --> 52:18.650]  I don't feel one way or another about the Tigers in particular.
[52:19.130 --> 52:20.150]  I do hope they turn it around.
[52:20.490 --> 52:20.970]  I do too.
[52:21.310 --> 52:25.610]  That's a pretty storied franchise that deserves more than they're getting.
[52:26.010 --> 52:27.670]  And it's really a bummer.
[52:27.790 --> 52:32.050]  And also, I've been rolling with the White Sox for a very, very long time.
[52:32.270 --> 52:34.830]  And we're all pretty fucking worn out by it.
[52:34.830 --> 52:37.670]  It's just like...
[52:38.030 --> 52:38.770]  Who's your favorite team?
[52:38.850 --> 52:39.970]  They kick me in the dick team.
[52:40.770 --> 52:44.230]  I line up every year for about eight months, and they just kick me in the dick over and over again.
[52:44.270 --> 52:46.910]  Then I get four months to ice my balls, and then I go back and do it again.
[52:47.090 --> 52:48.150]  That's what it's like to be a White Sox fan.
[52:48.150 --> 52:50.470]  Yeah, man, I'm a Padres fan, and then I was a Chargers fan.
[52:50.610 --> 52:52.990]  It was year-round dick punch.
[52:53.610 --> 52:54.890]  I was a Detroit fan.
[52:55.270 --> 52:57.570]  They don't even kick you in the dick anymore, because they just feel bad.
[52:58.350 --> 53:00.030]  They're just like, hey, you guys...
[53:00.030 --> 53:01.250]  You got it, you got it.
[53:01.250 --> 53:02.610]  It's not about winning, it's about having fun.
[53:02.630 --> 53:03.970]  The name of the game is fun.
[53:03.970 --> 53:04.490]  Yep.
[53:04.630 --> 53:06.170]  Here's Hank Aaron, the Hama.
[53:06.570 --> 53:09.730]  Jared Shuster, Jose Caballero, Trice Tureng.
[53:09.770 --> 53:10.630]  I don't know any of these rookies.
[53:10.790 --> 53:11.530]  And then Sean Manea.
[53:11.690 --> 53:12.150]  All right.
[53:13.030 --> 53:15.370]  I think we're probably ready.
[53:15.510 --> 53:17.350]  Let's do one more of these packs.
[53:17.790 --> 53:24.470]  And then we're probably ready to get into what is going to be the final big pull.
[53:24.650 --> 53:28.110]  Have you seen the Detroit Tigers' batting practice hat?
[53:28.770 --> 53:29.010]  No.
[53:29.590 --> 53:30.450]  It's just got the...
[53:30.450 --> 53:31.510]  They got the...
[53:31.510 --> 53:32.970]  It's got the cat on it and stuff.
[53:32.970 --> 53:34.110]  The old cat or the...
[53:34.110 --> 53:35.210]  No, their spring training hat.
[53:35.350 --> 53:35.510]  I'm sorry.
[53:35.910 --> 53:36.750]  It's got...
[53:36.750 --> 53:37.910]  No, it's just the regular...
[53:37.910 --> 53:38.910]  He's like...
[53:38.910 --> 53:40.770]  There's the old design of the cat.
[53:40.890 --> 53:41.950]  I wish they would bring that back.
[53:41.950 --> 53:43.230]  I got Geoff a shirt of that.
[53:43.250 --> 53:43.830]  The crazy...
[53:43.830 --> 53:45.010]  The fucking cracked out...
[53:45.610 --> 53:46.330]  He's awesome.
[53:47.130 --> 53:48.430]  A lot of Justin Berlander today.
[53:48.550 --> 53:48.790]  Okay.
[53:49.230 --> 53:50.910]  What's it gonna be, Eric?
[53:50.970 --> 53:55.410]  Are we gonna open up this very expensive single card or this not so expensive video game?
[53:55.410 --> 53:56.370]  Now, here's what I'll say.
[53:57.310 --> 53:59.070]  We don't have to leave it totally up to the chat.
[53:59.950 --> 54:02.770]  The chat, shockingly, voted for the video game.
[54:02.770 --> 54:03.390]  Hell yeah.
[54:03.670 --> 54:05.030]  79% or whatever.
[54:05.290 --> 54:10.410]  I think, with that information, it was just Emily's birthday, so she should choose.
[54:11.170 --> 54:14.090]  Thank you for this opportunity to listen to the people.
[54:14.310 --> 54:20.930]  And as the people's princess, I will only listen to my people and we will go for whatever they vote for.
[54:21.290 --> 54:21.470]  Wow.
[54:21.870 --> 54:22.930]  Here's what we're not opening today.
[54:23.030 --> 54:25.310]  We're gonna open up a $75, $80, whatever.
[54:25.310 --> 54:26.090]  It's gonna be Duck Hunt.
[54:26.550 --> 54:29.850]  This is one card that I think we paid about $300 for this.
[54:30.570 --> 54:30.950]  Nice.
[54:30.950 --> 54:32.770]  Somebody thought it was assigned to basketball.
[54:32.930 --> 54:34.430]  I just read it wrong.
[54:34.530 --> 54:38.830]  Well, then you should tune in for not next week, because we're not gonna be here, but the week after, and we'll open that.
[54:38.910 --> 54:41.210]  I don't know what's in that fucking box now that I know what it is.
[54:41.610 --> 54:41.970]  Man.
[54:42.250 --> 54:42.810]  Maybe you...
[54:42.810 --> 54:44.610]  I gotta stop letting the other people involved.
[54:44.750 --> 54:45.950]  I really wanna open that fucking thing.
[54:45.950 --> 54:48.170]  Why don't you open that box and we just buy another one?
[54:49.090 --> 54:49.450]  What?!
[54:50.510 --> 54:52.110]  I used all of our budget on that box.
[54:52.130 --> 54:52.810]  Yeah, no kidding!
[54:52.970 --> 54:53.510]  It's fine.
[54:53.770 --> 54:55.170]  We can girl math this and figure it out.
[54:55.170 --> 54:56.170]  This is not how this works.
[54:56.490 --> 54:57.710]  All right, this is $46.50.
[54:57.710 --> 55:01.710]  Let's see what highly collectible and hopefully rare...
[55:02.510 --> 55:02.990]  Gyromite!
[55:03.830 --> 55:05.510]  NES video game we've got.
[55:06.030 --> 55:07.290]  Ooh, it comes with a...
[55:07.290 --> 55:08.030]  Fisher can't wait.
[55:08.130 --> 55:08.590]  He's stoked.
[55:09.510 --> 55:11.030]  Oh, that's bad.
[55:11.090 --> 55:12.110]  I was like, it came with a card.
[55:12.210 --> 55:13.190]  It's the Medal of Honor card.
[55:13.430 --> 55:14.750]  How did it come with a Medal of Honor card?
[55:15.690 --> 55:16.930]  This is Hit Parade.
[55:17.810 --> 55:18.710]  And this is...
[55:19.890 --> 55:23.050]  the video game...
[55:23.050 --> 55:23.990]  Mega Man!
[55:24.010 --> 55:25.070]  Mega Man!
[55:25.630 --> 55:26.510]  That's pretty cool.
[55:26.890 --> 55:27.550]  Yeah, I don't...
[55:27.550 --> 55:28.770]  Whoa, that's awesome.
[55:28.810 --> 55:29.110]  Yay!
[55:29.250 --> 55:31.570]  I didn't know we were capable of stuff like that.
[55:31.610 --> 55:32.130]  That was pretty cool.
[55:32.150 --> 55:34.350]  An original Mega Man.
[55:34.490 --> 55:36.050]  Does it say what it's graded at or anything?
[55:36.410 --> 55:37.210]  I don't think it's graded.
[55:37.390 --> 55:38.810]  It's just sealed and authentic.
[55:39.050 --> 55:41.230]  Do you want me to go home and get this for you, or what?
[55:41.230 --> 55:42.190]  Yeah, you can just get this for me.
[55:42.210 --> 55:42.870]  I mean, I just...
[55:42.870 --> 55:44.090]  We can go to any yard sale and get it.
[55:44.150 --> 55:44.350]  Yeah.
[55:44.550 --> 55:46.250]  I think they're harder to get now, apparently.
[55:46.390 --> 55:47.490]  So there you go, Mega Man.
[55:47.790 --> 55:48.810]  Well, it's like...
[55:49.510 --> 55:50.710]  The seal is nice.
[55:50.810 --> 55:51.790]  The sticker's good.
[55:51.850 --> 55:52.430]  It's in great shape.
[55:53.130 --> 55:55.970]  Don't we have some old Xbox games we're gonna get graded?
[55:56.910 --> 55:57.230]  No.
[55:57.650 --> 55:59.550]  I have something I'm supposed to send to Andrew.
[55:59.870 --> 56:01.390]  That he's interested in getting graded.
[56:01.510 --> 56:03.090]  Maybe we'll get this graded and see what that's about.
[56:03.210 --> 56:04.010]  All right, let's open this up.
[56:04.070 --> 56:04.370]  Yeah!
[56:06.290 --> 56:07.070]  Yeah, I just want to know.
[56:07.170 --> 56:08.170]  We're doing both, baby!
[56:08.510 --> 56:11.310]  As the People's Princess, we just want everybody to enjoy.
[56:11.390 --> 56:12.630]  I want everyone to be happy.
[56:12.930 --> 56:15.030]  I just want to see what my fuck-up got us.
[56:15.050 --> 56:15.290]  Uh-huh.
[56:15.570 --> 56:17.050]  Like, what's the...
[56:17.650 --> 56:18.410]  How much was it?
[56:18.610 --> 56:18.930]  $350?
[56:19.290 --> 56:19.570]  $350.
[56:19.830 --> 56:22.050]  I want to see what this $350 fuck-up got us.
[56:22.710 --> 56:22.990]  Boom!
[56:24.330 --> 56:25.410]  Yeah, that's good.
[56:25.670 --> 56:25.970]  $350.
[56:26.290 --> 56:27.090]  What do you want it to be?
[56:27.590 --> 56:28.690]  Anything worth $300.
[56:28.730 --> 56:29.670]  What do you guess?
[56:31.130 --> 56:31.530]  Uh...
[56:32.730 --> 56:33.990]  Uh, LeBron oughta...
[56:34.510 --> 56:34.710]  Ha!
[56:35.030 --> 56:35.550]  Oh, okay.
[56:35.690 --> 56:36.230]  Tatum rookie.
[56:36.630 --> 56:36.750]  Okay.
[56:36.970 --> 56:38.330]  I mean, it's gonna be that kind of thing.
[56:38.510 --> 56:39.130]  You think so?
[56:39.250 --> 56:39.390]  Okay.
[56:39.390 --> 56:39.470]  Yeah.
[56:39.630 --> 56:40.610]  No, but, yeah, let's see.
[56:42.070 --> 56:42.870]  Maybe it's a...
[56:42.870 --> 56:43.750]  Here it comes.
[56:43.810 --> 56:44.110]  Here it comes.
[56:44.430 --> 56:46.530]  Set it up.
[56:47.010 --> 56:47.770]  Show everyone.
[56:47.770 --> 56:54.010]  It is a Shadon Sharp PSA 10 rookie optics autograph.
[56:55.390 --> 56:56.690]  That's not a poop.
[56:56.890 --> 56:57.950]  That's a really good card.
[56:58.690 --> 57:00.070]  I don't think it's a $350 card.
[57:00.190 --> 57:00.430]  No.
[57:01.270 --> 57:01.710]  But...
[57:01.710 --> 57:02.010]  Maybe.
[57:02.310 --> 57:02.770]  Who is that?
[57:03.070 --> 57:03.590]  Shadon Sharp.
[57:03.870 --> 57:04.130]  He's good.
[57:04.230 --> 57:04.930]  He plays for the Trailblazers.
[57:05.070 --> 57:06.410]  He was a rookie last year.
[57:06.510 --> 57:08.010]  This is, I believe, his second or third year.
[57:08.290 --> 57:12.310]  He just got, I want to say, a season-ending injury, like, a week ago.
[57:12.510 --> 57:14.510]  Or at least he's out for a little bit.
[57:14.790 --> 57:16.170]  But he's real good.
[57:17.430 --> 57:19.250]  This is one of the...
[57:19.250 --> 57:23.330]  Like, if you're going to get a rookie card of a top prospect like this, this would be a good one to get.
[57:23.470 --> 57:24.630]  Optic is highly sought after.
[57:24.950 --> 57:26.470]  Probably behind Prism these days.
[57:26.550 --> 57:27.670]  It probably goes Prism, Optic.
[57:27.970 --> 57:28.210]  Really?
[57:28.410 --> 57:28.710]  Yeah.
[57:28.850 --> 57:30.770]  Over, like, Select and Mosaic and those.
[57:32.030 --> 57:32.750]  And it's...
[57:32.750 --> 57:33.550]  I wish it was on card.
[57:34.590 --> 57:36.730]  It's not a $350 card, I don't think.
[57:37.270 --> 57:37.590]  But...
[57:37.590 --> 57:37.990]  Oh, shit.
[57:38.050 --> 57:39.230]  It's numbered to 49.
[57:39.370 --> 57:39.830]  It might be.
[57:39.990 --> 57:40.650]  It might be.
[57:41.070 --> 57:43.350]  That might be a decent card.
[57:43.790 --> 57:44.230]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:44.230 --> 57:45.010]  Let's see real fast.
[57:45.010 --> 57:45.870]  R-O-A-S-S-P.
[57:46.950 --> 57:47.850]  R-O-A-S-S-P.
[57:48.050 --> 57:48.110]  Wow.
[57:48.110 --> 57:48.490]  Not bad.
[57:48.890 --> 57:50.390]  Maybe we should put that on our...
[57:50.390 --> 57:51.110]  That's a good little get.
[57:52.070 --> 57:53.390]  That's not a bad card.
[57:53.990 --> 57:55.270]  Are you looking at it right now?
[57:55.410 --> 57:55.950]  Yeah, why not?
[57:55.970 --> 57:56.890]  Behind the scenes.
[57:57.050 --> 57:57.150]  What's that?
[57:58.930 --> 57:59.290]  $150?
[57:59.950 --> 58:00.430]  Mm-hmm.
[58:03.050 --> 58:03.770]  It's sold...
[58:04.230 --> 58:06.550]  Well, that one's sold for $316.
[58:07.050 --> 58:07.930]  Oh, hell yeah.
[58:10.170 --> 58:12.090]  That was numbered to five.
[58:12.210 --> 58:13.010]  That was a golden number to ten.
[58:13.390 --> 58:13.830]  A number to eight.
[58:13.830 --> 58:15.090]  You know...
[58:15.090 --> 58:15.690]  This is an emerald.
[58:15.710 --> 58:16.650]  You win some, you lose some.
[58:17.230 --> 58:18.990]  To be determined on this one, though...
[58:18.990 --> 58:22.010]  If Shadon Sharp makes the All-Star Game once in his career,
[58:23.130 --> 58:24.050]  you've got a money's worth.
[58:24.170 --> 58:24.410]  Okay.
[58:25.030 --> 58:25.630]  That's very exciting.
[58:25.670 --> 58:28.730]  If the Portland Trailblazers win a title, forget about it.
[58:29.710 --> 58:32.130]  All right, I'll hold my breath for that one, bud.
[58:32.170 --> 58:34.030]  Now that they don't have Damien Loewen.
[58:34.030 --> 58:34.330]  Yeah.
[58:34.910 --> 58:35.710]  Oh, finally.
[58:36.170 --> 58:38.250]  Get rid of the dead weight.
[58:38.650 --> 58:39.750]  They've got Shadon Sharp.
[58:40.470 --> 58:42.150]  They've got Stude Henderson.
[58:42.150 --> 58:43.570]  They don't have Shadon Sharp.
[58:43.570 --> 58:45.390]  They've got Jeremy Grant.
[58:45.630 --> 58:47.510]  They've got Malcolm Brogdon.
[58:47.770 --> 58:50.450]  They've got a very injured Robert Williams.
[58:50.710 --> 58:51.770]  Oh, he's from Boston.
[58:51.770 --> 58:52.830]  He's always injured.
[58:52.850 --> 58:53.290]  I know.
[58:53.390 --> 58:53.890]  A baby.
[58:54.030 --> 58:55.710]  Well, thank you so much for watching.
[58:56.150 --> 58:59.650]  And if you're watching this, you can sign up to become a First Member, guys.
[58:59.750 --> 59:00.990]  Thank you so much for your support.
[59:01.170 --> 59:02.430]  We can't do it without you.
[59:02.570 --> 59:05.310]  And this Friday at 10 a.m. Central...
[59:05.310 --> 59:06.390]  Ah! Falcon Collection!
[59:07.270 --> 59:08.150]  SwordArtRoosterTeeth.com
[59:08.150 --> 59:10.110]  Release the falcon on someone.
[59:10.630 --> 59:12.010]  I don't know how many falcons we have,
[59:12.010 --> 59:14.510]  but we also have a shirt, a hat, a bumper sticker.
[59:14.630 --> 59:15.130]  We got it all.
[59:15.290 --> 59:16.050]  SwordArtRoosterTeeth.com
[59:16.050 --> 59:17.190]  Fuck Facepod.
[59:18.070 --> 59:18.870]  Facepod.com
[59:18.870 --> 59:22.090]  Slash first to sign up and support us.
[59:22.130 --> 59:22.890]  Thank you so much.
[59:23.090 --> 59:23.990]  Release the falcon.
[59:24.090 --> 59:24.630]  I love that.
[59:24.710 --> 59:25.990]  It's kind of like releasing the kraken,
[59:26.070 --> 59:26.790]  but this one's real.
[59:26.930 --> 59:27.650]  Okay, here he comes. Ready?
[59:28.390 --> 59:28.690]  Ah!
[59:30.210 --> 59:31.130]  Let him go.
