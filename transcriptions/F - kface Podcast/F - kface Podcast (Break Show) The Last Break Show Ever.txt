[00:03.270 --> 00:06.970]  We're watching the hip drop tackle to see how dangerous it is.
[00:07.070 --> 00:10.770]  Yeah, Eric was telling me that the NFL owners have banned the hip drop tackle.
[00:10.970 --> 00:12.770]  Maybe they banned it for being too safe.
[00:13.490 --> 00:15.970]  Could you imagine if the NBA owners just went,
[00:16.050 --> 00:19.130]  there's a new rule, and the NBA Players Association was just like,
[00:19.750 --> 00:21.330]  well, I mean, that's not... we'll just walk out.
[00:21.510 --> 00:21.870]  Is there?
[00:22.210 --> 00:23.230]  Like, no.
[00:24.250 --> 00:25.510]  Hi, welcome to The Break Show.
[00:25.810 --> 00:28.230]  Hello, and welcome to the...
[00:29.330 --> 00:31.350]  Fuck Face Break Show.
[00:31.350 --> 00:35.810]  The last Fuck Face Break Show we're probably gonna do.
[00:36.330 --> 00:40.170]  It's a break show where we break stuff for the Fuck Face Podcast.
[00:40.170 --> 00:41.770]  You can't say that. You have to use the thing.
[00:42.150 --> 00:44.390]  Not a thing for much longer either, I think.
[00:44.450 --> 00:45.850]  Right, but it is for now.
[00:46.010 --> 00:47.870]  It is today, right?
[00:48.110 --> 00:50.190]  Today we're opening up cards and we're...
[00:51.170 --> 00:51.990]  What are they gonna do?
[00:52.230 --> 00:54.710]  Shut down my YouTube channel that I'm about to not have anymore?
[00:56.850 --> 00:57.330]  Anyway.
[00:58.590 --> 01:01.730]  We're so glad to have you for this one last time.
[01:02.870 --> 01:05.950]  Breaking cards and looking at shit and making fun of each other.
[01:06.090 --> 01:08.450]  And Eric's... he usually... we don't talk about it a lot.
[01:08.850 --> 01:11.110]  Eric usually farts a lot. He's a quiet farter.
[01:11.610 --> 01:14.590]  And so there's always like a smell factor that we're working through.
[01:14.910 --> 01:16.710]  Emily and I try to be very professional about.
[01:17.010 --> 01:18.670]  And I feel like we do a good job most of the time.
[01:20.030 --> 01:22.050]  Because sometimes... sometimes the stench is...
[01:22.050 --> 01:23.350]  He has these coffee farts.
[01:23.490 --> 01:25.310]  We always do AMBA on Mondays.
[01:25.310 --> 01:27.390]  And then it's just the rest of the day.
[01:27.490 --> 01:29.830]  I just want you to realize what classic projection is.
[01:30.850 --> 01:32.930]  Like, I know he woke up with a tummy ache this morning.
[01:34.110 --> 01:36.710]  Dude, I had some... I ate at a soup leaf last night.
[01:37.150 --> 01:37.970]  And I was...
[01:38.570 --> 01:40.710]  We went with Burndog and Vanessa to soup leaf.
[01:40.770 --> 01:43.470]  Which if you've not been, because you don't live in Austin, it's hot pot.
[01:44.150 --> 01:47.470]  As Gus describes, it's raw meat in tepid water.
[01:47.730 --> 01:47.930]  Yeah.
[01:48.390 --> 01:48.890]  Kind of.
[01:49.930 --> 01:52.650]  And everybody went ham on ham.
[01:53.090 --> 01:54.230]  Everybody went crazy on the meat.
[01:54.230 --> 01:56.270]  I had one piece of beef.
[01:56.330 --> 01:57.210]  And then I said vegetables.
[01:57.310 --> 01:59.090]  It felt like a veggie night to me.
[01:59.190 --> 02:00.810]  It was shitting my brains out.
[02:00.830 --> 02:02.710]  Maybe your body's not used to so many vegetables.
[02:03.270 --> 02:04.330]  I don't like vegetables.
[02:04.450 --> 02:06.230]  In the meantime, have you had any Wonder Bread?
[02:06.730 --> 02:08.090]  Or like a zebra cake or something?
[02:08.270 --> 02:09.210]  Just to even it out?
[02:09.250 --> 02:09.910]  Nutty Buddies.
[02:10.710 --> 02:12.350]  I did. I had a bag of...
[02:12.350 --> 02:16.490]  I had a bag of these new Airheads bites.
[02:16.810 --> 02:17.750]  They're really fucking good.
[02:17.950 --> 02:19.270]  I equalized it with those.
[02:19.270 --> 02:20.890]  Have you heard about the Olipop stuff?
[02:21.510 --> 02:23.950]  The soda that has fiber in it?
[02:24.230 --> 02:25.470]  I've heard of the soda.
[02:25.730 --> 02:25.810]  Yeah.
[02:25.850 --> 02:27.090]  I don't know what the drama is.
[02:27.210 --> 02:28.930]  You're only supposed to have like one a day.
[02:29.070 --> 02:30.990]  Because it has like 5 grams of fiber.
[02:31.390 --> 02:34.510]  And the average American gets like 12 grams of fiber a day.
[02:34.730 --> 02:36.330]  And people are having like 3 or 4.
[02:36.630 --> 02:37.030]  Hell yeah.
[02:37.190 --> 02:38.550]  And so...
[02:38.550 --> 02:39.570]  It's doing damage.
[02:39.590 --> 02:40.130]  Doing wonders.
[02:40.330 --> 02:40.750]  Pretty cool.
[02:41.210 --> 02:41.810]  Pretty cool stuff.
[02:42.110 --> 02:42.790]  Have an Olipop.
[02:42.930 --> 02:44.410]  Crack one open. Crack open a cold one.
[02:44.630 --> 02:47.210]  Plumbing industry couldn't be happier.
[02:47.230 --> 02:48.690]  Thumbs up. Thumbs up.
[02:48.690 --> 02:49.950]  Oh, the Gerpler.
[02:50.290 --> 02:51.010]  They're the...
[02:51.010 --> 02:52.010]  The fucking...
[02:52.770 --> 02:53.570]  The plunger.
[02:53.630 --> 02:53.930]  Butter Chunji?
[02:54.230 --> 02:54.430]  What?
[02:54.810 --> 02:54.970]  No.
[02:55.190 --> 02:56.590]  It was the plunge tube, right?
[02:56.710 --> 02:56.910]  Yeah.
[02:57.050 --> 02:57.210]  Yeah.
[02:57.310 --> 02:58.810]  The grown tube plunger.
[02:59.850 --> 03:01.030]  Never see the light of day.
[03:01.090 --> 03:02.250]  You could do a butter maker with that.
[03:02.250 --> 03:03.070]  Never see the light of day.
[03:03.130 --> 03:03.850]  A butter churner?
[03:03.950 --> 03:04.230]  Yeah.
[03:04.730 --> 03:05.530]  But with it.
[03:05.570 --> 03:06.270]  I don't like when you do that.
[03:06.310 --> 03:06.930]  Can we open something?
[03:07.250 --> 03:07.650]  Stop.
[03:08.170 --> 03:08.530]  Stop.
[03:08.950 --> 03:09.170]  Stop.
[03:09.490 --> 03:10.130]  Oh, hey.
[03:10.170 --> 03:11.570]  Before we open something, check this out.
[03:12.490 --> 03:18.870]  This Friday at 10 a.m., it's our very last ever face merch drop.
[03:19.270 --> 03:20.450]  And we will have...
[03:20.450 --> 03:21.510]  He bleeped the fuck.
[03:22.730 --> 03:23.190]  Come on.
[03:23.550 --> 03:25.830]  We'll have the Sloppy Joe's variant jersey.
[03:26.150 --> 03:28.550]  We'll have the Sloppy Joe's variant hat.
[03:28.910 --> 03:31.410]  We'll also have our classic face hat.
[03:31.590 --> 03:32.770]  And then the cookbook.
[03:33.110 --> 03:33.730]  Oh, yeah.
[03:33.870 --> 03:34.050]  Yeah.
[03:34.190 --> 03:36.030]  Please don't digitize and repost that.
[03:36.190 --> 03:39.830]  Yeah, please don't digitize and repost the fuck cookbook.
[03:40.230 --> 03:40.990]  We don't want...
[03:40.990 --> 03:41.590]  Please don't.
[03:41.730 --> 03:42.790]  Actually, don't, because we might...
[03:42.790 --> 03:44.350]  If we retain the rights to it, maybe we could sell it digitally.
[03:44.350 --> 03:46.670]  Yeah, so please wait and be patient.
[03:47.150 --> 03:49.150]  One guy online who's real upset about it.
[03:49.150 --> 03:50.110]  Just be real patient.
[03:50.190 --> 03:50.830]  Just please be patient.
[03:50.870 --> 03:51.610]  He's not watching this.
[03:51.650 --> 03:52.170]  I don't give a fuck.
[03:52.810 --> 03:54.910]  So, 10 a.m. Central Time.
[03:55.310 --> 03:58.310]  Be there for our very last merch drop ever.
[03:58.590 --> 04:00.310]  But now it's time to get into a sack.
[04:00.770 --> 04:05.450]  Speaking of last ever, let's open up the pack sack for one last time.
[04:06.770 --> 04:11.570]  Well, probably not one last time, because this show will continue in some form in the future.
[04:11.670 --> 04:12.010]  Like on TikTok.
[04:12.010 --> 04:14.630]  I've been doing it on TikTok very quietly for the last couple days.
[04:14.710 --> 04:16.590]  And I'll probably keep doing that, like, just one pack a day.
[04:16.690 --> 04:17.670]  But who knows?
[04:17.970 --> 04:21.270]  I'm going to say what the TikTok name is here, so people can see it.
[04:22.190 --> 04:23.570]  I had a feeling this was going to happen.
[04:23.910 --> 04:24.950]  Geoff's Daily Rip.
[04:25.110 --> 04:25.670]  Geoff's Daily Rip.
[04:25.770 --> 04:26.110]  There you go.
[04:26.270 --> 04:28.230]  Saw that coming from a mile away.
[04:29.690 --> 04:30.410]  I'm looking.
[04:30.510 --> 04:31.430]  I'm looking to see what it is.
[04:31.450 --> 04:33.750]  Oh, you're grabbing, like, the good stuff.
[04:34.250 --> 04:35.190]  I'm fucking cheating.
[04:35.190 --> 04:35.770]  Why not?
[04:35.950 --> 04:37.030]  Why not? Nothing matters anymore.
[04:37.050 --> 04:38.270]  My rules, my stuff.
[04:38.590 --> 04:39.790]  I bought all these dumb cards.
[04:39.870 --> 04:39.970]  God's dead.
[04:40.270 --> 04:41.150]  We can do whatever we want.
[04:41.290 --> 04:44.970]  That is one nice thing about this whole deal, is I bought almost, like, most of all of this.
[04:45.130 --> 04:46.190]  Yeah, this is all your stuff.
[04:46.210 --> 04:48.030]  It's all my personal stuff, so I don't have to worry about losing it.
[04:48.030 --> 04:49.550]  I don't have any of this. I have all you, bud.
[04:50.750 --> 04:52.150]  And we'll open up...
[04:52.150 --> 04:53.290]  Where's the box that you brought?
[04:53.430 --> 04:53.870]  Down here.
[04:53.990 --> 04:54.610]  It's right down here.
[04:55.590 --> 04:59.230]  Oh, in honor of Eric, we'll open up the Garbage Pail Kids Chrome.
[04:59.450 --> 05:00.350]  I know he loves them.
[05:00.690 --> 05:02.050]  I fucking hate these cards.
[05:03.110 --> 05:05.210]  I hate Garbage Pail Kids so much.
[05:05.310 --> 05:06.370]  This is, like, the ugliest...
[05:06.370 --> 05:09.810]  It's just, like, the 80s, and it's, like, it's ugliest refinement.
[05:10.290 --> 05:11.630]  Fingers crossed for an Eric.
[05:11.810 --> 05:12.430]  I hope so, too.
[05:12.610 --> 05:13.070]  What would it be?
[05:13.450 --> 05:13.870]  Van...
[05:14.330 --> 05:15.350]  It'd be, like...
[05:15.350 --> 05:16.110]  Erupting Eric?
[05:16.390 --> 05:18.230]  Erupting Eric, and it would be all of his diarrhea.
[05:18.490 --> 05:18.770]  Oh.
[05:20.010 --> 05:20.850]  Van Trilliquist.
[05:21.170 --> 05:21.470]  Okay.
[05:22.330 --> 05:23.170]  Foxy Francis.
[05:23.670 --> 05:23.990]  Nice.
[05:24.610 --> 05:25.450]  Rocky Horror.
[05:25.830 --> 05:26.250]  Ooh.
[05:26.910 --> 05:28.190]  And Bruce Moose.
[05:28.250 --> 05:29.850]  I kinda like... I like the Rocky Horror.
[05:30.490 --> 05:31.070]  Do you like that?
[05:31.070 --> 05:31.250]  Yeah.
[05:31.350 --> 05:32.830]  You can have that if you want it.
[05:32.890 --> 05:33.510]  I'm good.
[05:33.970 --> 05:35.010]  Nothing matters anymore.
[05:35.870 --> 05:38.630]  And then we'll open up this pack of, uh, 89 football.
[05:38.850 --> 05:39.330]  I don't know why.
[05:39.750 --> 05:41.270]  I've just been thinking about football cards lately.
[05:41.850 --> 05:43.530]  You ever do that, where you just think about football cards?
[05:43.550 --> 05:45.350]  Well, yeah, I think about the hip drop tackle.
[05:45.850 --> 05:46.050]  Yeah.
[05:46.090 --> 05:46.670]  You can't do it.
[05:46.770 --> 05:47.510]  You can't think about it.
[05:47.510 --> 05:48.650]  You're not allowed to do it anymore, Gracie.
[05:48.990 --> 05:50.270]  Oh, look at that.
[05:50.330 --> 05:51.470]  Jim Kelly read the offense.
[05:52.050 --> 05:52.210]  Damn.
[05:52.210 --> 05:52.850]  Or the defense.
[05:53.270 --> 05:54.710]  Geoff Ramsey didn't read the card.
[05:54.830 --> 05:55.010]  No.
[05:55.330 --> 05:57.090]  Uh, Cunningham fakes the field.
[05:57.470 --> 05:58.930]  There's a Sheldon White.
[05:59.550 --> 05:59.910]  Whoa.
[05:59.910 --> 06:00.150]  Whoa.
[06:00.150 --> 06:01.350]  We want people to know that it was real.
[06:01.630 --> 06:01.950]  Whoa.
[06:02.070 --> 06:03.350]  We want people to know that it was real.
[06:04.250 --> 06:04.570]  Exclusive.
[06:04.850 --> 06:05.990]  Tony has this.
[06:06.090 --> 06:07.150]  It's the clogged tube.
[06:07.310 --> 06:07.750]  Oh, is that the prototype?
[06:07.750 --> 06:09.450]  You can see that it's tested.
[06:09.610 --> 06:10.210]  It's the prototype.
[06:11.110 --> 06:12.510]  Are you fucking serious?
[06:12.770 --> 06:13.230]  Oh, my.
[06:19.480 --> 06:19.800]  These...
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.820]  Now, do you think if someone online flips that, they really like it?
[06:24.180 --> 06:25.120]  Hang on, let me make eye contact.
[06:28.160 --> 06:28.700]  Was that good?
[06:28.700 --> 06:29.120]  Let me try it.
[06:29.160 --> 06:29.660]  That was good.
[06:30.160 --> 06:30.400]  All right.
[06:30.500 --> 06:31.380]  Try to section it.
[06:34.560 --> 06:35.580]  It's not making the noise.
[06:35.680 --> 06:36.440]  Yeah, oh, it's weird.
[06:36.580 --> 06:37.340]  That's so weird.
[06:37.420 --> 06:39.320]  I think if you can use your wrist, it'll help.
[06:40.420 --> 06:41.160]  Oh, it worked.
[06:41.380 --> 06:41.860]  Section it to this.
[06:42.440 --> 06:43.800]  No, no, no.
[06:45.020 --> 06:48.440]  So, this is a real thing that we were gonna make, but...
[06:48.880 --> 06:49.200]  Okay.
[06:49.460 --> 06:50.060]  Hell, yeah.
[06:50.160 --> 06:50.380]  Oh, my God.
[06:54.300 --> 06:55.160]  Look at that grip.
[06:55.360 --> 06:56.020]  That's not good.
[06:57.440 --> 06:58.440]  Oh, that's good grip.
[06:59.100 --> 06:59.760]  Oh, my God.
[06:59.880 --> 07:00.620]  All right, it ain't coming off.
[07:00.960 --> 07:01.360]  All right, here we go.
[07:01.360 --> 07:03.320]  Yeah, so, are these on a boat somewhere?
[07:03.720 --> 07:07.500]  Yeah, I mean, like, we were gonna try to do it, and we're not, and...
[07:07.500 --> 07:07.860]  Sorry.
[07:09.480 --> 07:11.780]  Maybe they'll get delivered after everybody moves out.
[07:11.860 --> 07:12.040]  Thanks, Tony.
[07:12.480 --> 07:13.160]  Thank you, Tony.
[07:13.380 --> 07:13.960]  Grab them.
[07:14.880 --> 07:17.200]  We'll save that for the Fuckface Museum.
[07:17.720 --> 07:18.600]  Chris, good.
[07:20.760 --> 07:22.260]  Long gets the snap.
[07:23.680 --> 07:26.640]  Everybody, do you remember when Eric Martin made the Thousand Yard Club?
[07:26.720 --> 07:27.260]  I think we all do.
[07:27.480 --> 07:27.920]  Wow.
[07:28.340 --> 07:29.760]  Here's Ron Wolfley.
[07:30.920 --> 07:32.140]  That's a cool haircut.
[07:32.400 --> 07:34.480]  Bubba Parris looks like a Bubba.
[07:34.960 --> 07:35.960]  Jay Novacek.
[07:39.220 --> 07:40.020]  Danny Noonan.
[07:40.400 --> 07:44.160]  I'm a big fan of how guys in the NFL just used to look like guys.
[07:44.440 --> 07:44.700]  Yeah.
[07:45.160 --> 07:48.000]  They don't look like they were doing it their whole lives since, like, Pee-wee.
[07:48.100 --> 07:48.580]  You know what I mean?
[07:48.700 --> 07:51.100]  You know who looked like a guy to me?
[07:51.240 --> 07:51.400]  Hmm.
[07:51.820 --> 07:52.700]  Good old John Booty.
[07:52.840 --> 07:53.400]  Oh, there you go.
[07:53.540 --> 07:54.200]  Got that booty.
[07:54.440 --> 07:54.700]  Yeah.
[07:56.380 --> 07:58.320]  Also, John Elliott, that's a guy.
[07:58.640 --> 07:59.420]  That's a guy's guy.
[07:59.980 --> 08:01.140]  That's a gut, too.
[08:01.240 --> 08:01.500]  Yeah.
[08:01.580 --> 08:02.900]  See, they're just looking like dudes.
[08:03.240 --> 08:03.880]  Reggie Robey.
[08:04.100 --> 08:04.280]  Yep.
[08:04.460 --> 08:06.360]  Just guys being guys, you know?
[08:06.920 --> 08:08.240]  When things were good.
[08:08.660 --> 08:10.540]  That single bar face mask thing.
[08:10.740 --> 08:11.240]  Oh, man.
[08:11.620 --> 08:12.420]  Bring it back.
[08:12.600 --> 08:13.560]  Bring it back.
[08:13.660 --> 08:14.460]  No eye protection.
[08:14.700 --> 08:15.380]  Get gouged.
[08:15.740 --> 08:16.960]  What the fuck is this?
[08:17.060 --> 08:17.580]  So, Burndog...
[08:17.580 --> 08:18.320]  You get a Pokeball?
[08:18.900 --> 08:19.260]  Burndog...
[08:19.260 --> 08:20.360]  There's a way you can just rip it.
[08:20.440 --> 08:21.020]  You don't even have to...
[08:21.020 --> 08:21.960]  I like this knife.
[08:23.220 --> 08:24.520]  Burndog bought this for us.
[08:24.640 --> 08:24.720]  Really?
[08:24.720 --> 08:28.140]  He bought us a bunch of stuff to open on the Break Show, and then we went out of business.
[08:28.140 --> 08:28.560]  Awesome.
[08:28.560 --> 08:29.600]  We didn't do it at the Break Show.
[08:30.320 --> 08:32.280]  But, yeah, I found it was floating around the house.
[08:32.300 --> 08:36.520]  Burndog is our friend who Geoff plays trucks with, and now sometimes other games.
[08:36.640 --> 08:37.400]  Now we play fish now.
[08:37.480 --> 08:38.120]  Now they fish.
[08:38.180 --> 08:38.640]  Now we're fish.
[08:38.700 --> 08:39.240]  Now we're fishermen.
[08:40.940 --> 08:42.220]  Well, now it's got to be cut again.
[08:42.760 --> 08:43.200]  No way.
[08:43.440 --> 08:44.140]  What the fuck did...
[08:45.500 --> 08:46.200]  Oh, God.
[08:46.320 --> 08:46.600]  Right there?
[08:46.700 --> 08:47.000]  All right.
[08:47.140 --> 08:48.620]  That's a trip to urgent care, again.
[08:48.800 --> 08:49.240]  Yeah, again.
[08:51.700 --> 08:52.540]  Oh, does it do?
[08:52.640 --> 08:53.520]  Does it do finish?
[08:54.460 --> 08:56.980]  All of Does It Do is out now if you want to watch it.
[08:56.980 --> 08:57.980]  Was today the last episode?
[08:58.160 --> 08:58.260]  Yeah.
[08:58.520 --> 08:59.220]  Episode 7 or 8?
[08:59.540 --> 08:59.740]  8.
[09:00.020 --> 09:00.660]  It was 8.
[09:00.820 --> 09:00.980]  Yeah.
[09:01.060 --> 09:02.560]  Do you know what comes out this Saturday?
[09:03.300 --> 09:04.020]  Does It...
[09:04.020 --> 09:04.580]  Will It...
[09:04.580 --> 09:05.020]  Did It Do?
[09:05.140 --> 09:05.620]  Did We Do?
[09:05.660 --> 09:06.100]  Did We Do?
[09:06.240 --> 09:07.040]  Comes out this Saturday.
[09:07.240 --> 09:07.760]  That's exciting.
[09:07.880 --> 09:08.040]  Yep.
[09:08.220 --> 09:08.680]  What's that?
[09:10.460 --> 09:11.560]  Two years ago?
[09:11.860 --> 09:13.840]  It has to be at least two years ago.
[09:14.020 --> 09:14.740]  Is it the forbidden footage?
[09:15.660 --> 09:15.900]  No.
[09:16.060 --> 09:16.260]  Oh.
[09:16.360 --> 09:16.520]  No.
[09:17.000 --> 09:17.840]  Can you release that now?
[09:18.500 --> 09:18.860]  No.
[09:19.320 --> 09:19.680]  No.
[09:19.820 --> 09:21.860]  I like our idea for how to release it, but I guess that'll never happen.
[09:22.560 --> 09:27.040]  This was a thing where it was putting together the ideas, essentially the ideation of like
[09:27.040 --> 09:29.260]  what things should we do for Does It Do?
[09:30.360 --> 09:30.760]  And...
[09:31.540 --> 09:37.320]  We did a video where Andrew made us watch all the commercials for his suggestions for Season 2.
[09:37.400 --> 09:37.760]  Oh, I love it.
[09:37.800 --> 09:40.780]  And then so all the stuff that we did in Season 2 came from those commercials.
[09:41.020 --> 09:44.420]  But we didn't want to spoil the season, so we said, oh, we'll just have it come out after.
[09:44.440 --> 09:44.800]  We'll hold onto it.
[09:45.080 --> 09:48.040]  And then I couldn't get this company to make this fucking show.
[09:48.120 --> 09:48.640]  It took a while.
[09:48.640 --> 09:50.780]  So, luckily, Gracie could.
[09:51.140 --> 09:52.020]  So, thank you, Gracie.
[09:52.180 --> 09:52.440]  Gracie!
[09:54.200 --> 09:57.100]  When you say this company, is it this company that went out of business?
[09:59.720 --> 10:02.060]  Apparently, Gracie's been moonlighting at a coffee shop the whole time.
[10:02.740 --> 10:03.980]  That wasn't Gracie.
[10:04.220 --> 10:06.180]  That was a woman that looked just like Gracie.
[10:07.200 --> 10:08.080]  What is this?
[10:08.300 --> 10:09.740]  We got ourselves a James Harden.
[10:10.220 --> 10:10.620]  Cool.
[10:10.900 --> 10:11.900]  We got our James Harden jersey.
[10:12.020 --> 10:13.180]  So go ahead and put...
[10:13.180 --> 10:13.940]  I mean, that's Philadelphia.
[10:14.060 --> 10:14.820]  He will not be playing.
[10:14.860 --> 10:15.880]  You're gonna have to repaint that.
[10:16.060 --> 10:17.520]  But isn't that the jersey we got?
[10:17.520 --> 10:18.900]  Was it Philadelphia jersey?
[10:18.900 --> 10:19.720]  Yeah, that was the jersey we got.
[10:19.880 --> 10:20.460]  He will...
[10:20.940 --> 10:23.280]  I assume the Philadelphia jersey was never game worn.
[10:26.460 --> 10:28.680]  I'll sooner die than play for Philadelphia.
[10:28.940 --> 10:30.260]  Oh, here's his little baby card.
[10:30.400 --> 10:30.820]  That's fun.
[10:31.060 --> 10:31.900]  Yeah, there you go.
[10:32.700 --> 10:34.000]  He got a little basketball, too?
[10:34.320 --> 10:35.700]  Yeah, and then he gets a little basketball.
[10:35.700 --> 10:36.560]  Does it, like, go in his hand?
[10:37.180 --> 10:37.980]  I think so.
[10:39.140 --> 10:39.780]  Is it, like, a magnet?
[10:40.420 --> 10:40.760]  No.
[10:41.260 --> 10:42.500]  Oh, it's just a magnet?
[10:42.740 --> 10:43.180]  A magnet?
[10:43.240 --> 10:44.100]  I don't remember it being that high-tech.
[10:44.600 --> 10:45.300]  These are magnets.
[10:45.580 --> 10:46.140]  I think it just hangs out next to him.
[10:46.300 --> 10:46.660]  Magnets?
[10:46.660 --> 10:48.160]  He's got a gimpy leg.
[10:48.380 --> 10:50.100]  Anyway, that's very cool.
[10:50.360 --> 10:51.560]  Maybe that's why he had to sit out.
[10:51.560 --> 10:52.320]  That's why he doesn't play.
[10:52.360 --> 10:53.200]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:53.200 --> 10:53.800]  He didn't like this.
[10:55.240 --> 10:55.740]  Where is he?
[10:56.100 --> 10:56.400]  Clippers?
[10:56.680 --> 10:58.480]  James Harden plays for the Los Angeles Clippers.
[10:59.180 --> 11:01.900]  The Ty Lue coached Los Angeles Clippers.
[11:02.660 --> 11:04.400]  When you think of him, do you think of him as a Houston Rocket?
[11:04.660 --> 11:05.580]  Yes, I do.
[11:06.560 --> 11:07.700]  I think most people do.
[11:07.960 --> 11:08.120]  Yeah.
[11:08.860 --> 11:10.960]  Well, that was when he, you know...
[11:10.960 --> 11:11.360]  Showed up?
[11:12.440 --> 11:13.660]  It was at the height of his career.
[11:13.760 --> 11:14.660]  Well, I mean, that's when...
[11:15.740 --> 11:18.720]  Have you seen the correlation between his performances for clubs?
[11:20.840 --> 11:21.800]  Is this my cutie cup?
[11:21.900 --> 11:26.780]  This is the final attempt at getting your cutie cup.
[11:26.980 --> 11:27.940]  And who are you looking for again?
[11:28.080 --> 11:29.640]  I want Marie or Dumbo.
[11:30.000 --> 11:30.880]  We haven't gotten either.
[11:31.360 --> 11:31.720]  I know.
[11:31.760 --> 11:32.540]  Don't look early, don't look early.
[11:32.540 --> 11:36.100]  If I get another fucking Cruella or Raja, I'm gonna be mad.
[11:36.340 --> 11:36.880]  Is it Dumbo?
[11:37.480 --> 11:38.480]  Oh, it's Eeyore!
[11:40.020 --> 11:42.900]  I didn't even know I could get an Eeyore, but I love him.
[11:43.060 --> 11:43.460]  Look at that.
[11:43.460 --> 11:46.420]  Look at your final cutie cup is Eeyore.
[11:46.460 --> 11:48.340]  I love Eeyore. He's so sweet.
[11:48.380 --> 11:49.180]  He's a sweetie.
[11:49.500 --> 11:50.780]  He's a good guy.
[11:50.880 --> 11:53.620]  I don't have a collar to put him on, but he could be on my shoulder.
[11:53.640 --> 11:54.240]  That's nice.
[11:54.740 --> 11:57.240]  Before I lost my job, I bought this.
[11:58.780 --> 12:00.200]  It was $109.
[12:00.740 --> 12:01.880]  Wish I could take that back now.
[12:01.920 --> 12:02.400]  Oh my God!
[12:02.520 --> 12:03.000]  Imagine having $109.
[12:03.020 --> 12:05.800]  This is the final autograph thing we'll open up.
[12:05.940 --> 12:08.100]  Did you share your life hack?
[12:09.460 --> 12:10.440]  What's my life hack?
[12:10.800 --> 12:11.740]  When you got that phone call.
[12:12.620 --> 12:14.620]  Oh, about how I tell people I lost my job?
[12:14.840 --> 12:15.040]  Oh, yeah.
[12:15.960 --> 12:16.780]  Why save it?
[12:18.180 --> 12:18.440]  Okay.
[12:19.040 --> 12:19.960]  Nothing matters anymore.
[12:20.040 --> 12:21.980]  I mean, what, are we trying to game the system?
[12:22.380 --> 12:24.620]  What, are we getting banger views on this thing?
[12:24.700 --> 12:25.380]  I love it, dude.
[12:25.760 --> 12:26.660]  Let's just go for it.
[12:26.940 --> 12:28.080]  We don't even have to do the full hour.
[12:28.220 --> 12:29.980]  If we burn through this stuff, we can take off early.
[12:30.060 --> 12:31.480]  You can do whatever you want. I'm here.
[12:32.900 --> 12:34.640]  Justin wants to get paid, so we gotta stick around.
[12:35.840 --> 12:36.420]  Alright, what do we got?
[12:37.380 --> 12:38.040]  Emily, you have a look.
[12:38.140 --> 12:39.100]  He already peeked!
[12:39.480 --> 12:40.060]  Did you peek?
[12:40.060 --> 12:41.840]  He didn't even look at the bot, he just went, eh.
[12:42.000 --> 12:42.880]  Did you do a sneaky beaky?
[12:43.200 --> 12:44.760]  Okay, now what do you think it is?
[12:46.240 --> 12:47.140]  Since Geoff peeked.
[12:47.600 --> 12:48.520]  I can't see.
[12:48.760 --> 12:49.380]  You're not gonna know.
[12:50.480 --> 12:51.220]  7402 MVP?
[12:51.540 --> 12:51.920]  92?
[12:52.300 --> 12:53.280]  79 and 92?
[12:55.600 --> 13:00.940]  1974 AL MVP, two-time all-star, 1969 number one overall draft pick, Washington.
[13:01.240 --> 13:02.160]  Never heard of them.
[13:04.020 --> 13:04.740]  James Burrow.
[13:05.160 --> 13:05.820]  Geoff Burrows.
[13:05.900 --> 13:06.300]  That was close.
[13:06.440 --> 13:07.000]  Geoff Burrows.
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.860]  My entire life, I've never heard of Geoff Burrows.
[13:09.860 --> 13:10.700]  He played for the A's?
[13:11.120 --> 13:11.560]  I guess so.
[13:12.080 --> 13:13.360]  Number one overall draft pick.
[13:13.480 --> 13:15.480]  I'm just saying stuff, I don't know if any of it's true.
[13:16.180 --> 13:18.720]  Well, there you go, we got the Geoff Burrows auto we were looking for.
[13:18.940 --> 13:19.260]  Yeah!
[13:20.020 --> 13:21.240]  Take that, Pete Rose!
[13:21.340 --> 13:22.120]  Let's see what else Burden Dog got us.
[13:22.120 --> 13:25.360]  Again, if you are a billionaire and you wanna buy this show...
[13:25.360 --> 13:26.200]  Yeah, we're making a plea to you.
[13:26.200 --> 13:29.240]  We'll open this stuff for you right in front of you.
[13:29.740 --> 13:30.680]  I'm just letting you know.
[13:30.740 --> 13:33.520]  I'll put it all in my carry-on luggage, I'll bring it to your house.
[13:33.620 --> 13:34.260]  I'm fine with that.
[13:34.380 --> 13:35.760]  We're super happy to do it.
[13:35.920 --> 13:36.900]  Everything has a price.
[13:37.040 --> 13:37.200]  Yeah.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.080]  The price isn't much more than a plane ticket, honestly.
[13:41.580 --> 13:42.600]  Oh my God!
[13:42.600 --> 13:42.840]  Geoff!
[13:43.520 --> 13:44.440]  What the fuck, dude?
[13:44.440 --> 13:45.140]  It's Barbie!
[13:46.120 --> 13:47.300]  It hit me in the nose.
[13:47.380 --> 13:47.960]  That was cool.
[13:48.680 --> 13:49.280]  What'd you get?
[13:49.400 --> 13:49.900]  A Barbie.
[13:50.260 --> 13:50.580]  Uh-huh.
[13:51.060 --> 13:52.780]  And a little Barbie comic book.
[13:53.000 --> 13:53.360]  Oh!
[13:53.600 --> 13:55.280]  Okay, you got micro Barbie.
[13:55.580 --> 13:57.380]  And then you have to use this to look at it.
[13:57.520 --> 13:57.700]  Oh!
[13:58.380 --> 13:58.780]  There you go.
[13:58.880 --> 13:59.900]  Probably to read the comic.
[13:59.900 --> 14:00.420]  Wait, wait, you gotta hold it.
[14:00.700 --> 14:01.080]  There you go.
[14:01.240 --> 14:02.300]  And up more.
[14:02.640 --> 14:03.060]  There you go.
[14:03.720 --> 14:04.280]  This is good.
[14:07.400 --> 14:08.640]  Can you see what she said?
[14:08.700 --> 14:09.680]  Are you enjoying this at home?
[14:10.420 --> 14:12.340]  I can't believe this show went under.
[14:13.280 --> 14:14.340]  It's so crazy.
[14:14.960 --> 14:16.540]  Why would moving it closer...
[14:16.540 --> 14:17.080]  There you go.
[14:17.280 --> 14:18.920]  They have to move independent of one another.
[14:19.140 --> 14:19.740]  There you go.
[14:19.820 --> 14:20.000]  Yeah.
[14:20.640 --> 14:21.700]  There you go, there's Barbie.
[14:21.840 --> 14:22.260]  Good stuff.
[14:22.340 --> 14:23.180]  The tiny little Barbie.
[14:25.140 --> 14:25.780]  Is that your tummy?
[14:26.300 --> 14:26.580]  Yeah.
[14:26.860 --> 14:26.880]  Yes.
[14:28.580 --> 14:30.820]  And I'm the one with the coffee and all that.
[14:30.840 --> 14:31.480]  Okay, okay.
[14:31.600 --> 14:32.840]  That's what diarrhea sounds like.
[14:32.900 --> 14:33.060]  Yeah.
[14:33.200 --> 14:34.420]  Oh my God!
[14:34.440 --> 14:36.040]  You just fed him In-N-Out, what do you expect?
[14:36.040 --> 14:38.260]  Dude, I got mustard grilled, though.
[14:38.340 --> 14:39.340]  Let's open up one more backpack.
[14:39.580 --> 14:40.180]  Oh, another football!
[14:40.460 --> 14:40.680]  Nice.
[14:40.780 --> 14:41.600]  I didn't even mean to do that.
[14:41.940 --> 14:42.440]  That's awesome.
[14:42.880 --> 14:44.360]  I'm not looking here, because nothing matters.
[14:45.980 --> 14:47.340]  Life is in shambles.
[14:47.400 --> 14:47.820]  It's fine.
[14:47.920 --> 14:49.320]  Life is in shambles.
[14:49.620 --> 14:53.960]  Lomax, Fred Marion, Gary Corn on the Cob.
[14:54.120 --> 14:54.480]  Nice.
[14:54.560 --> 14:55.160]  Save that.
[14:55.280 --> 14:56.760]  I don't know why, I don't know who we're saving shit for.
[14:57.380 --> 15:02.040]  Michael Dean Perry, John L. Williams, Eric Dickerson.
[15:02.260 --> 15:02.840]  Remember him?
[15:04.760 --> 15:11.980]  Jay Hilgenberg, Mark Ripien, Mike Horan, Robin Cole.
[15:12.460 --> 15:12.860]  Ah!
[15:13.140 --> 15:13.860]  Howie Long.
[15:14.020 --> 15:14.420]  Nice.
[15:14.720 --> 15:16.340]  Look at Howie Long there, looking like a young dude.
[15:16.620 --> 15:18.300]  He is so fucking old now.
[15:18.840 --> 15:19.640]  Scott Case.
[15:19.660 --> 15:22.220]  Doesn't it feel like it happened very quickly with him, too?
[15:22.400 --> 15:22.800]  Overnight.
[15:23.580 --> 15:23.980]  Overnight.
[15:24.100 --> 15:24.720]  Like, it was just one season.
[15:25.060 --> 15:26.340]  2018, we went off the air.
[15:26.440 --> 15:28.260]  2019, they went, welcome to the preseason.
[15:28.340 --> 15:29.060]  And I went, Howie!
[15:29.340 --> 15:30.020]  It was crazy.
[15:30.360 --> 15:31.280]  Here, open that for Eric.
[15:31.340 --> 15:32.060]  It has his name on it.
[15:32.060 --> 15:32.980]  Oh, cool.
[15:33.340 --> 15:33.740]  Smackdown.
[15:34.180 --> 15:34.580]  Smackdown!
[15:35.100 --> 15:35.680]  Did it say what year?
[15:35.880 --> 15:42.540]  If you sent mail and it didn't get opened up on the podcast, it'll get found and I'll open it.
[15:42.780 --> 15:43.360]  Yeah, be patient.
[15:43.480 --> 15:44.180]  We have it.
[15:44.500 --> 15:45.300]  Be patient.
[15:45.520 --> 15:45.760]  Yeah.
[15:46.160 --> 15:47.560]  And then they can find you on TikTok where?
[15:48.860 --> 15:49.620]  Geoff's Daily Rip.
[15:49.800 --> 15:50.280]  There you go.
[15:51.860 --> 15:53.080]  It's Hardcore Holly!
[15:53.380 --> 15:53.940]  You know this dude?
[15:54.040 --> 15:54.660]  Yeah, it's Hardcore Holly.
[15:54.840 --> 15:56.240]  It's like a pink star.
[15:56.360 --> 15:57.500]  That's cool, I guess.
[15:57.500 --> 16:04.180]  He was mad that he never won the world title, so he pitched an idea where it was, you put the world title on me and I beat everybody.
[16:04.640 --> 16:05.280]  Hell yeah.
[16:05.520 --> 16:06.420]  I think that guy's a genius.
[16:08.360 --> 16:09.100]  Ooh, here we go.
[16:09.200 --> 16:10.140]  Here's a ladder match.
[16:10.780 --> 16:11.100]  Nice.
[16:11.520 --> 16:12.500]  I don't want to spoil anything.
[16:12.660 --> 16:12.740]  Yeah.
[16:13.180 --> 16:15.400]  But we might have seen a pretty interesting ladder match recently.
[16:15.540 --> 16:15.800]  Yeah.
[16:16.000 --> 16:16.820]  Last week or so.
[16:16.920 --> 16:17.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:17.560 --> 16:18.420]  We'll see when that comes out.
[16:18.440 --> 16:19.040]  We'll see when that comes out.
[16:19.060 --> 16:19.980]  Yeah, it was pretty interesting.
[16:20.540 --> 16:21.980]  That's The Rock and Triple H.
[16:22.960 --> 16:23.580]  Who won that fight?
[16:23.640 --> 16:23.940]  Do you remember?
[16:24.780 --> 16:26.500]  No, I would assume it's Triple...
[16:26.500 --> 16:28.520]  I think it was Triple H, and I think it was right when he blew out his knee.
[16:28.820 --> 16:29.920]  I think it was for the Intercontinental title.
[16:30.260 --> 16:31.380]  Do you recognize this gentleman?
[16:31.400 --> 16:33.000]  That's the road dog, Jesse James.
[16:34.360 --> 16:35.220]  Like the outlaw?
[16:35.480 --> 16:35.740]  Yeah.
[16:36.380 --> 16:37.640]  And then this fella?
[16:38.060 --> 16:38.880]  That's Albert.
[16:39.540 --> 16:40.560]  His name is Prince Albert.
[16:40.780 --> 16:41.800]  Hey, that's my dog's name.
[16:42.380 --> 16:43.220]  Your dog's name is Prince Albert?
[16:43.360 --> 16:44.360]  Prince Albert Brooks.
[16:44.480 --> 16:46.240]  And I think he's press-slamming Edge.
[16:46.380 --> 16:49.140]  And there's Triple H in China.
[16:49.640 --> 16:51.740]  I was in a room with him.
[16:52.000 --> 16:52.660]  Triple H?
[16:52.660 --> 16:54.760]  Triple H, when I did this...
[16:54.760 --> 16:57.540]  Bernie and I, before he died, we did this...
[16:57.540 --> 16:58.780]  Oh my God, not Bat-Dog?
[16:59.260 --> 16:59.920]  No, old Bernie.
[16:59.980 --> 17:00.460]  Old Bernie.
[17:00.900 --> 17:01.660]  We did this...
[17:02.360 --> 17:03.260]  Do you pay Bernie?
[17:03.260 --> 17:03.740]  Oh, sorry, go ahead.
[17:04.300 --> 17:04.620]  Upfront?
[17:04.920 --> 17:05.320]  Uh-huh, yeah.
[17:05.340 --> 17:06.160]  We did the upfronts one time.
[17:06.260 --> 17:08.860]  We had to do it for Warner Brothers.
[17:08.960 --> 17:09.600]  What year was it?
[17:10.120 --> 17:11.240]  2015, 16?
[17:11.240 --> 17:13.600]  This would have been...
[17:15.880 --> 17:16.200]  2018?
[17:17.700 --> 17:19.120]  And he was there...
[17:19.120 --> 17:21.520]  Because Bernie and I had to do a presentation to investors, right?
[17:21.520 --> 17:24.580]  And then a bunch of different people did.
[17:25.900 --> 17:27.260]  Brian Stelter from CNN did.
[17:27.500 --> 17:28.980]  He also lost his job at CNN.
[17:29.700 --> 17:31.880]  And then Triple H did it for AEW.
[17:32.020 --> 17:33.000]  No, WWE.
[17:33.280 --> 17:34.000]  WWE, yeah.
[17:34.240 --> 17:35.020]  He did a whole speech.
[17:35.020 --> 17:35.360]  It was cool.
[17:35.420 --> 17:36.180]  But I was in a room with him.
[17:36.220 --> 17:37.280]  He wasn't as big as I thought.
[17:37.420 --> 17:39.460]  Yeah, he's like an average-sized...
[17:39.460 --> 17:41.680]  Well, he also doesn't wrestle anymore, so...
[17:41.680 --> 17:42.440]  Probably had a lot to do with it.
[17:42.440 --> 17:43.280]  Probably had a lot to do with it, yeah.
[17:43.300 --> 17:43.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:44.140 --> 17:45.760]  But he's a guy who stays in very good shape.
[17:45.800 --> 17:48.160]  I mean, still a big, impressive dude, but you see him in person...
[17:48.160 --> 17:49.840]  Well, you don't have to do HGH all the time.
[17:49.860 --> 17:50.800]  You can just do it a little time.
[17:50.800 --> 17:51.540]  I was...
[17:51.540 --> 17:51.840]  Probably good.
[17:51.900 --> 17:53.920]  Because I was also in the same room with Shaq that day.
[17:53.960 --> 17:55.260]  Yeah, that's so different.
[17:55.480 --> 17:56.740]  Totally different experience.
[17:56.900 --> 17:58.040]  You're just like...
[17:58.040 --> 17:58.240]  Yeah.
[17:59.300 --> 18:00.800]  And then Bernie kept going, like, let's get a photo with him.
[18:00.900 --> 18:01.500]  You're a big fan.
[18:01.540 --> 18:02.540]  And I was like, I don't want to go anywhere near him.
[18:02.540 --> 18:03.060]  No, no.
[18:03.060 --> 18:03.540]  Please don't.
[18:03.620 --> 18:04.080]  Don't do that.
[18:04.420 --> 18:05.580]  Then he spent, like, the whole week...
[18:05.580 --> 18:07.660]  I was just terrified Bernie was going to make me talk to...
[18:07.660 --> 18:09.560]  Don't make me talk to Sha-Sha-Sha-Shaq.
[18:09.580 --> 18:10.600]  I don't wanna.
[18:10.920 --> 18:11.420]  Don't wanna?
[18:12.280 --> 18:12.840]  Zoe Brooks.
[18:12.960 --> 18:13.140]  Cool.
[18:13.240 --> 18:13.800]  DJ Wagner.
[18:14.440 --> 18:14.720]  Silver.
[18:15.200 --> 18:16.040]  Are these the McDonald's cards?
[18:16.040 --> 18:16.540]  Amber Rich.
[18:17.040 --> 18:17.520]  Ron Holland.
[18:17.520 --> 18:18.680]  Yeah, those are the McDonald's cards.
[18:18.840 --> 18:19.520]  Emily gave it to me.
[18:19.540 --> 18:20.200]  I don't know why she gave it to me.
[18:20.300 --> 18:20.960]  I don't know why you like those.
[18:21.160 --> 18:21.480]  Prism.
[18:21.680 --> 18:22.060]  I don't.
[18:22.200 --> 18:22.760]  Emily gave it to me.
[18:22.820 --> 18:23.440]  Cause it's a new tax action.
[18:23.440 --> 18:24.760]  I wanna get the Bronny Janes.
[18:25.340 --> 18:26.640]  Oh, so you did want them.
[18:26.720 --> 18:26.960]  Yes.
[18:27.780 --> 18:28.120]  Of course.
[18:29.700 --> 18:30.340]  Mike Conley.
[18:30.660 --> 18:31.220]  Diarrhea and projection.
[18:32.040 --> 18:32.280]  That's what always gets you.
[18:32.280 --> 18:33.120]  Hunter Tyson.
[18:33.320 --> 18:33.460]  Yup.
[18:33.800 --> 18:34.740]  Diarrhea is projection.
[18:35.280 --> 18:35.760]  That's true.
[18:37.240 --> 18:39.960]  Hey, remember when we had a plan for, like, the baseball stuff or whatever?
[18:40.160 --> 18:40.400]  Anyway.
[18:40.760 --> 18:41.120]  Oh, yeah.
[18:41.180 --> 18:42.280]  Open up the thing that was, like...
[18:42.280 --> 18:43.920]  This is the final box of baseball cards.
[18:44.080 --> 18:44.440]  Just blast through it.
[18:44.440 --> 18:45.460]  The expensive one.
[18:45.460 --> 18:46.560]  It was, like, 300 bucks.
[18:46.660 --> 18:46.900]  350.
[18:47.680 --> 18:48.640]  Bought it when I had a job.
[18:48.760 --> 18:49.960]  Could've just returned it, but...
[18:49.960 --> 18:50.080]  Alright.
[18:51.800 --> 18:52.660]  What's the fun in that?
[18:53.040 --> 18:54.280]  We're finally getting to the good stuff.
[18:54.380 --> 18:54.700]  Whee!
[18:54.780 --> 18:55.260]  The fun!
[18:55.680 --> 18:56.760]  So, are those, like, the good ones?
[18:57.040 --> 18:58.320]  Is that whole thing full?
[18:58.420 --> 18:59.300]  Or is it, like...
[18:59.680 --> 19:00.440]  No, it's full.
[19:01.020 --> 19:01.320]  That's full.
[19:01.400 --> 19:02.000]  Oh, shit.
[19:03.580 --> 19:04.860]  Too many baseball players.
[19:06.980 --> 19:08.580]  We'll just do like they do on breaks.
[19:08.640 --> 19:09.460]  We'll run through the paper.
[19:09.620 --> 19:10.140]  I like that.
[19:11.020 --> 19:12.060]  Just get to the good stuff.
[19:12.640 --> 19:13.860]  That's how Geoff does it on his TikTok.
[19:13.860 --> 19:17.360]  That's what the TV's on every time I come home.
[19:17.640 --> 19:18.000]  CoolVids?
[19:18.760 --> 19:20.020]  CoolVids is at night when we're all together.
[19:20.040 --> 19:20.200]  Oh, that's right.
[19:20.280 --> 19:20.560]  Okay, cool.
[19:20.560 --> 19:21.820]  I don't watch CoolVids without y'all.
[19:22.320 --> 19:24.300]  I'm not gonna call out anything that's not a big deal.
[19:24.740 --> 19:28.140]  Yeah, when Emily's not around, I just have...
[19:28.140 --> 19:28.820]  Oh, fuck!
[19:29.000 --> 19:29.700]  Oh, that's a cool one.
[19:29.780 --> 19:31.440]  Fuck, that's the photo variant.
[19:31.440 --> 19:32.400]  That's the photo one, right?
[19:32.500 --> 19:32.760]  Yeah.
[19:33.280 --> 19:33.980]  That's really cool.
[19:34.060 --> 19:34.600]  Jesus Lizardo.
[19:34.700 --> 19:35.300]  That's really cool.
[19:35.420 --> 19:36.060]  Is it numbered?
[19:36.560 --> 19:37.400]  I don't think so.
[19:37.440 --> 19:38.360]  I don't think these are numbered.
[19:38.720 --> 19:38.940]  No.
[19:39.380 --> 19:41.900]  But still, it's a pretty sought-after SP.
[19:42.160 --> 19:44.140]  Here's a C.J. Abrams gold.
[19:44.260 --> 19:44.700]  Oh, nice.
[19:44.840 --> 19:46.140]  That's not numbered either.
[19:46.500 --> 19:48.520]  Yeah, I keep breaks on probably 24 hours a day.
[19:48.900 --> 19:50.320]  It's just good background noise for me.
[19:50.360 --> 19:50.760]  Insane.
[19:50.840 --> 19:51.420]  Ronald McKinney Jr.
[19:51.420 --> 19:54.540]  It's just like a guy being like Roxton Garrett.
[19:54.700 --> 19:54.920]  Yeah.
[19:56.120 --> 19:58.160]  They're never funny about it.
[19:58.520 --> 19:59.300]  Corey Seeger.
[20:00.640 --> 20:02.360]  There's nothing really else to...
[20:02.360 --> 20:02.860]  Yeah, there you go.
[20:02.900 --> 20:04.100]  Just hold them right there and then we can...
[20:04.100 --> 20:04.780]  See, that's good.
[20:05.260 --> 20:06.580]  And let's see, Zach.
[20:07.360 --> 20:08.380]  Yeah, this is gonna...
[20:08.380 --> 20:09.380]  See if we see any Padres.
[20:09.740 --> 20:09.940]  Nope.
[20:10.540 --> 20:11.060]  Keep going.
[20:11.060 --> 20:14.260]  I'll go through it again and look for...
[20:14.260 --> 20:15.160]  Oh, Max Muncy.
[20:15.280 --> 20:15.680]  That's great.
[20:15.700 --> 20:16.180]  Whatever happened...
[20:16.180 --> 20:17.300]  What happened to Max Muncy?
[20:17.580 --> 20:18.720]  Oh, he's like my favorite Dodger.
[20:19.000 --> 20:19.520]  Because he sucks?
[20:19.680 --> 20:21.060]  Yeah, he fucking sucks shit.
[20:21.320 --> 20:21.880]  It's awesome.
[20:22.000 --> 20:22.540]  What do you mean?
[20:22.740 --> 20:23.700]  He's terrible.
[20:23.960 --> 20:24.940]  He's the king of the letdown.
[20:25.120 --> 20:26.120]  They put him at third base.
[20:26.240 --> 20:27.260]  He can't play third base.
[20:27.420 --> 20:28.380]  He can't fucking hit.
[20:28.580 --> 20:29.640]  He's my favorite Dodger.
[20:29.680 --> 20:30.660]  I have his rookie auto.
[20:30.940 --> 20:31.720]  I'm so bummed he didn't win.
[20:31.900 --> 20:32.300]  He...
[20:32.300 --> 20:33.620]  I don't know what happened.
[20:33.740 --> 20:36.540]  One year, he just went, I don't think I'm gonna play baseball anymore.
[20:36.700 --> 20:37.740]  So he's...
[20:37.740 --> 20:38.320]  He stopped.
[20:39.200 --> 20:39.600]  Ryan...
[20:39.600 --> 20:40.380]  He's continuing.
[20:40.780 --> 20:42.620]  He's just not playing baseball anymore.
[20:43.460 --> 20:43.920]  Who was that?
[20:44.040 --> 20:44.660]  Like Ben Simmons?
[20:44.860 --> 20:45.660]  Oh, yeah.
[20:45.960 --> 20:46.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:46.480 --> 20:47.400]  He's like my back hurts.
[20:47.460 --> 20:48.160]  He's got back problems.
[20:48.240 --> 20:49.100]  Oh, my back hurts.
[20:49.660 --> 20:50.360]  Oh, here we go.
[20:50.700 --> 20:51.100]  Nice.
[20:51.560 --> 20:52.120]  Rainbow foil.
[20:52.680 --> 20:53.080]  Nice.
[20:53.740 --> 20:55.340]  Here's a Fernando Tatis blue card.
[20:55.580 --> 20:55.740]  Nice.
[20:55.740 --> 20:57.940]  Nolan Arenado, 35th throwback.
[20:59.360 --> 20:59.760]  Rude.
[21:00.460 --> 21:00.760]  Wow.
[21:00.860 --> 21:01.980]  That's how much he stunk.
[21:02.280 --> 21:02.400]  Yeah.
[21:02.480 --> 21:03.600]  They were like, we've got to get him.
[21:03.780 --> 21:04.820]  Get him out of here.
[21:05.300 --> 21:05.360]  Anyway.
[21:05.760 --> 21:06.780]  We know about your ankle.
[21:06.920 --> 21:07.540]  Get out of here.
[21:10.240 --> 21:10.600]  Okay.
[21:10.880 --> 21:13.640]  I'm debating on getting the new MLB game.
[21:13.780 --> 21:14.080]  Yeah?
[21:14.160 --> 21:16.220]  It's not going to be any different from the last one.
[21:16.380 --> 21:17.400]  Do you have any new players?
[21:17.540 --> 21:18.700]  Boy, I want to fucking play it.
[21:18.840 --> 21:19.180]  You should.
[21:19.320 --> 21:19.800]  Do it.
[21:20.160 --> 21:21.600]  Oh, dude.
[21:22.260 --> 21:23.120]  It's on Game Pass.
[21:23.240 --> 21:24.580]  Yeah, but I have like a bad Xbox.
[21:25.180 --> 21:25.520]  Oh, yeah.
[21:25.580 --> 21:27.860]  I learned that I have what I thought was a good Xbox.
[21:28.940 --> 21:30.620]  You mean the big black one?
[21:30.780 --> 21:30.880]  Yeah.
[21:31.020 --> 21:31.840]  I'm not buying that.
[21:32.160 --> 21:33.460]  I also have a bad Xbox.
[21:33.540 --> 21:33.980]  Until I have to.
[21:35.080 --> 21:36.480]  Yeah, but you like that for trucks.
[21:36.960 --> 21:37.520]  And fish.
[21:37.700 --> 21:38.280]  And fish.
[21:38.280 --> 21:38.980]  Yeah.
[21:39.080 --> 21:39.960]  Fucking trucks, dude.
[21:40.800 --> 21:41.860]  Oh, what do you think?
[21:41.980 --> 21:42.660]  Gavin can yell fish.
[21:42.760 --> 21:43.100]  That's fun.
[21:43.540 --> 21:44.480]  Gold Sean Murphy.
[21:44.720 --> 21:46.260]  People love that when Gavin yells fish.
[21:46.420 --> 21:52.700]  Watching Geoff and Burn Dog discover that game last night, watching the trailer was the funniest thing.
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.540]  Is that the MLB's betting player, Shahoe Ohtani?
[21:56.680 --> 21:56.900]  Yeah.
[21:57.080 --> 21:57.920]  Has he talked to the...
[21:57.920 --> 21:58.380]  Does anyone know?
[21:58.460 --> 21:59.740]  Did he talk to the media yet today?
[22:00.140 --> 22:01.100]  He said he was going to.
[22:01.120 --> 22:02.280]  I'm going to have a...
[22:03.200 --> 22:04.820]  You know who's fucking happy right now?
[22:05.080 --> 22:05.380]  Japanese?
[22:05.620 --> 22:07.740]  The soon-to-be unbanned Pete Rose.
[22:08.540 --> 22:09.600]  They're going to have to.
[22:09.840 --> 22:12.620]  Pete Rose is about to make it into the Hall of Fame.
[22:13.080 --> 22:13.480]  Finally.
[22:13.920 --> 22:16.540]  Took Shahoe Ohtani betting on sports for him to do it.
[22:16.900 --> 22:17.280]  Allegedly.
[22:17.720 --> 22:17.780]  Yep.
[22:18.220 --> 22:21.740]  Shahoe Ohtani is supposed to address everyone at 2.45 p.m. Central...
[22:21.740 --> 22:21.840]  No.
[22:22.200 --> 22:23.680]  2.45 p.m. Pacific.
[22:24.780 --> 22:26.440]  So that will be in the middle of this show.
[22:26.640 --> 22:27.420]  Do not turn away.
[22:27.960 --> 22:28.440]  That will be...
[22:28.440 --> 22:29.240]  I mean, it won't...
[22:29.240 --> 22:33.580]  Stay here to get the live updates on Shahoe Ohtani and his gambling scandal.
[22:33.800 --> 22:35.420]  Brought to you by DraftKings.
[22:35.560 --> 22:35.840]  Eric.
[22:36.060 --> 22:36.220]  Yeah.
[22:36.220 --> 22:38.420]  Get your dick ready to get super hard, okay?
[22:38.700 --> 22:38.960]  Oh, boy.
[22:39.220 --> 22:40.100]  Always is, bud.
[22:40.300 --> 22:40.780]  All right, good.
[22:40.880 --> 22:41.360]  Staying hard.
[22:41.700 --> 22:43.000]  I just saw what we pulled.
[22:43.080 --> 22:43.500]  All right, let's do it.
[22:43.500 --> 22:44.120]  Your dick's going to pop.
[22:44.300 --> 22:45.300]  It's going to pop out.
[22:46.860 --> 22:46.940]  Okay.
[22:47.260 --> 22:49.180]  Here we have...
[22:49.180 --> 22:49.680]  Hit me with it.
[22:49.780 --> 22:50.680]  ...a relic.
[22:51.160 --> 22:52.420]  Let's go ahead and put these around.
[22:52.520 --> 22:53.820]  Let's see what we got here going on.
[22:53.880 --> 22:55.220]  We got ourselves a...
[22:55.680 --> 22:56.000]  a...
[22:56.000 --> 22:56.340]  a...
[22:57.200 --> 22:57.520]  a...
[22:57.520 --> 22:57.820]  a...
[22:57.820 --> 23:01.780]  I don't see a tiny Kevin Hart in that one.
[23:02.140 --> 23:03.440]  We'll have to go back and look for those later.
[23:03.520 --> 23:04.780]  Austin Hayes.
[23:04.960 --> 23:06.120]  Yadda, yadda, yadda.
[23:06.680 --> 23:07.520]  Spencer Strider.
[23:07.900 --> 23:08.540]  Walter Strider.
[23:08.660 --> 23:09.220]  Water Strider.
[23:09.600 --> 23:10.080]  Astro's...
[23:10.080 --> 23:10.180]  No, no.
[23:10.420 --> 23:11.400]  Tony Gwynn!
[23:11.400 --> 23:12.980]  Number 25!
[23:14.060 --> 23:14.520]  Is that a bat?
[23:14.580 --> 23:14.920]  Wow!
[23:15.120 --> 23:19.080]  The greatest hitters of all time on the 35th throwback.
[23:19.180 --> 23:20.760]  Number 24 of 25.
[23:20.940 --> 23:22.320]  That is a huge hit.
[23:22.420 --> 23:22.900]  Congratulations.
[23:23.440 --> 23:26.660]  1989 Tony Gwynn baseball relic.
[23:27.860 --> 23:33.640]  This memorabilia contained in this card is not from any specific game of event or season,
[23:33.780 --> 23:35.120]  but it is from his bat.
[23:35.580 --> 23:36.060]  Wow!
[23:36.480 --> 23:36.880]  You see that?
[23:37.160 --> 23:37.360]  Yeah.
[23:37.920 --> 23:38.900]  So there you go, man.
[23:38.960 --> 23:39.580]  That's fucking cool.
[23:40.700 --> 23:44.620]  Pretty rare that we get a hit of that caliber.
[23:44.820 --> 23:45.760]  Kiebert Ruiz.
[23:46.000 --> 23:46.920]  James Altman.
[23:47.480 --> 23:47.920]  Kiebert Ruiz.
[23:48.380 --> 23:49.700]  Garrett Cole throwback.
[23:52.900 --> 23:54.260]  Sending that to the group chat, baby!
[23:54.660 --> 23:55.720]  That's fucking cool.
[23:55.720 --> 23:56.420]  Quadratus group chat?
[23:56.760 --> 23:59.240]  It's me and my friend Brian and Sean from Mega64.
[24:00.060 --> 24:00.780]  Friend Jonathan.
[24:01.260 --> 24:02.660]  They're about to fucking flip.
[24:03.160 --> 24:04.620]  Also, did you watch SDSU play last night?
[24:04.720 --> 24:05.960]  Fucking stomped on you, baby.
[24:06.120 --> 24:06.740]  They did.
[24:06.980 --> 24:07.560]  That was awesome.
[24:07.640 --> 24:09.920]  Did you do a men's bracket fantasy?
[24:10.080 --> 24:10.780]  No, no, no.
[24:10.840 --> 24:12.460]  I don't participate in March Madness.
[24:12.540 --> 24:13.540]  I just watch it for the Aztecs.
[24:13.720 --> 24:15.100]  I'm killing it in mine right now.
[24:15.540 --> 24:16.340]  You don't have to watch it.
[24:16.400 --> 24:17.220]  You just pick.
[24:17.580 --> 24:19.260]  Yeah, but I don't want to do that.
[24:19.320 --> 24:19.640]  Teammates.
[24:20.440 --> 24:21.000]  Oh, those two?
[24:21.040 --> 24:21.360]  Same team.
[24:21.680 --> 24:22.220]  But hang on.
[24:23.340 --> 24:24.580]  Who's the guy on the left?
[24:24.580 --> 24:26.580]  Just the last name.
[24:26.660 --> 24:26.920]  I'm sorry.
[24:27.080 --> 24:27.600]  Just the last name.
[24:27.840 --> 24:28.480]  And then the guy on the right?
[24:28.680 --> 24:28.920]  Last name?
[24:29.100 --> 24:29.540]  Betz.
[24:29.600 --> 24:32.080]  Oh, this is an Otani Betz card.
[24:32.500 --> 24:33.160]  That's good.
[24:33.600 --> 24:34.000]  That's good.
[24:34.480 --> 24:38.960]  I've been hounding my friend who's a Dodgers fan.
[24:40.440 --> 24:43.760]  It has been so good.
[24:43.760 --> 24:44.540]  That's so funny.
[24:44.620 --> 24:46.280]  It writes itself, baby.
[24:46.520 --> 24:48.300]  That is so fucking funny.
[24:48.440 --> 24:49.220]  That's great, dude.
[24:49.540 --> 24:50.740]  Hey, Tariq Scooble.
[24:54.460 --> 24:55.460]  Oh, good.
[24:55.760 --> 24:56.400]  Latty Jr.
[24:56.580 --> 24:57.500]  Let's see what we got here.
[24:57.620 --> 24:59.480]  We got Otis numbered to $299.
[25:00.200 --> 25:02.160]  We have a Dean Kramer.
[25:02.560 --> 25:02.820]  Cool.
[25:03.260 --> 25:05.260]  Orange Fleck or whatever it's called.
[25:05.980 --> 25:08.060]  Nico Horner, Rainbow Foil.
[25:08.240 --> 25:09.140]  Ronald Acuna Jr.
[25:09.260 --> 25:09.640]  Bluebird.
[25:09.740 --> 25:11.240]  We got Ken Griffey Jr.
[25:12.180 --> 25:13.380]  35 throwback.
[25:14.300 --> 25:15.740]  What's your favorite baseball mascot?
[25:17.300 --> 25:17.580]  Oh.
[25:19.860 --> 25:20.460]  The...
[25:20.460 --> 25:20.720]  I mean, I don't know.
[25:20.720 --> 25:21.800]  I mean, obviously Swingin' Friar.
[25:21.900 --> 25:22.260]  Love him.
[25:22.400 --> 25:22.700]  Great.
[25:22.820 --> 25:23.080]  Of course.
[25:23.800 --> 25:26.220]  If I had to pick one outside of that, I like the Oriole.
[25:26.600 --> 25:27.100]  He's so cute.
[25:27.540 --> 25:30.300]  He's like a big bird that's very cool.
[25:30.500 --> 25:36.060]  The worst one is Dinger, the purple dinosaur for the Colorado Rockies.
[25:36.200 --> 25:36.580]  I hate him.
[25:36.600 --> 25:37.380]  Oh, I've never seen him.
[25:37.400 --> 25:38.040]  I despise him.
[25:38.460 --> 25:39.260]  I hate you.
[25:40.240 --> 25:41.520]  That's a good question.
[25:41.820 --> 25:42.220]  Thanks.
[25:42.400 --> 25:42.600]  It is.
[25:43.660 --> 25:45.600]  I know people are going to say the Fanatic.
[25:45.740 --> 25:47.120]  I think that's a knee-jerk reaction.
[25:47.720 --> 25:48.660]  He's pretty cool, though.
[25:48.880 --> 25:49.840]  He's fine.
[25:50.540 --> 25:55.420]  Isn't it the guy that is in the Fanatic costume is the one that invented all the other mascots?
[25:55.580 --> 25:56.880]  I think I saw a Real Sports about it.
[25:57.020 --> 25:57.720]  I don't know.
[25:57.840 --> 25:58.640]  I hate...
[25:58.640 --> 25:59.640]  Nothing matters anymore.
[25:59.800 --> 26:00.000]  Yeah.
[26:00.520 --> 26:01.460]  I hate this guy.
[26:01.780 --> 26:02.140]  King of Virginia.
[26:03.560 --> 26:04.360]  There he is.
[26:04.420 --> 26:05.180]  Oh, that's cute.
[26:05.460 --> 26:05.860]  I hate him.
[26:05.960 --> 26:06.280]  Dinger.
[26:06.520 --> 26:06.860]  I love him.
[26:06.980 --> 26:08.520]  I want them to hit balls at him.
[26:09.140 --> 26:10.620]  Oh, he's so cute.
[26:10.840 --> 26:11.700]  He's like a Triceratops.
[26:12.080 --> 26:13.680]  He is just like a Triceratops.
[26:13.820 --> 26:14.300]  I love it.
[26:14.320 --> 26:15.880]  Ronald LaCunia Jr.'s stealing the base.
[26:16.100 --> 26:16.680]  He looks like a pizza.
[26:17.260 --> 26:17.680]  He is?
[26:17.720 --> 26:18.500]  He's taking it!
[26:18.500 --> 26:19.060]  He's taking it!
[26:19.060 --> 26:19.960]  He's getting out of here!
[26:20.520 --> 26:21.300]  Barry Larkin.
[26:21.440 --> 26:22.080]  35 throwback.
[26:22.080 --> 26:22.700]  Oh, that's cool.
[26:22.980 --> 26:23.740]  I like Larkin.
[26:23.780 --> 26:24.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[26:24.640 --> 26:25.420]  Larkin was awesome.
[26:25.540 --> 26:25.700]  Yeah.
[26:26.440 --> 26:26.860]  That's cool.
[26:28.360 --> 26:29.200]  Playing on their iPad.
[26:30.680 --> 26:31.520]  Watching TikToks together.
[26:31.520 --> 26:32.220]  They're doing Angry Birds.
[26:34.640 --> 26:38.440]  They're looking to go, ooh, how do I get these pigs?
[26:39.860 --> 26:45.120]  So for the Round Rock Express, which is around here, is that like the G League for baseballs?
[26:45.140 --> 26:45.400]  Yes.
[26:45.560 --> 26:45.640]  Yes.
[26:45.640 --> 26:46.220]  It is AAA.
[26:46.360 --> 26:48.480]  It's the highest level of minor league baseball.
[26:48.480 --> 26:50.980]  before making it to the majors.
[26:51.700 --> 26:56.340]  So everyone that you'll see there, not everyone, but a majority of the guys there are at least
[26:56.340 --> 26:59.680]  going to get a look from the Texas Rangers.
[26:59.780 --> 27:00.060]  Okay.
[27:00.280 --> 27:01.020]  Who is there.
[27:01.240 --> 27:01.960]  That's who they feed into?
[27:02.100 --> 27:02.120]  Yeah.
[27:02.200 --> 27:02.380]  Yes.
[27:03.680 --> 27:04.800]  Ooh, nice.
[27:05.080 --> 27:06.260]  You got to pick a game.
[27:06.520 --> 27:07.360]  Worms McGee.
[27:07.520 --> 27:08.060]  Yeah, hey.
[27:08.880 --> 27:10.420]  Here we got Devin Williams-Gold.
[27:11.280 --> 27:14.640]  J-Rod for the outfield, whatever.
[27:15.720 --> 27:16.500]  Pete Alonzo.
[27:17.540 --> 27:18.920]  There's a little wiener hanging out there.
[27:19.060 --> 27:19.340]  Yep.
[27:19.620 --> 27:20.660]  Oh my God, it is.
[27:20.760 --> 27:21.100]  Hell yeah.
[27:21.360 --> 27:25.860]  Dude, you got to let me know what game you pick for Tatis.
[27:26.000 --> 27:26.120]  I will.
[27:26.280 --> 27:28.860]  And then we'll make a whole thing out of it.
[27:28.920 --> 27:29.860]  I've been saving all those.
[27:29.980 --> 27:31.140]  I've got like 15 of them.
[27:31.360 --> 27:33.480]  I'll just do them all at once and then we'll plot out the team.
[27:33.480 --> 27:35.560]  You think we'll do a whole day of baseball?
[27:35.560 --> 27:36.000]  We'll do a day.
[27:36.200 --> 27:36.960]  We'll do it all on the same day.
[27:37.040 --> 27:38.000]  That's fucking cool.
[27:38.220 --> 27:39.140]  What if we go to the games?
[27:39.500 --> 27:39.720]  Okay.
[27:40.240 --> 27:41.860]  Boy, that's a lot of work.
[27:42.860 --> 27:43.880]  Because it's all on the same day.
[27:44.240 --> 27:44.520]  Yeah.
[27:45.880 --> 27:47.840]  It is my brother-in-law.
[27:47.980 --> 27:49.780]  Because I have a brother-in-law now because we're married.
[27:49.920 --> 27:50.220]  Yeah.
[27:50.520 --> 27:52.340]  Kent from Ask a Ninja.
[27:52.620 --> 27:53.480]  My brother-in-law.
[27:53.680 --> 27:54.480]  My brother-in-law.
[27:54.680 --> 27:56.520]  The guy from Ask a Ninja.
[27:57.380 --> 28:00.980]  So weird, by the way, that we worked together in like the early 2000s.
[28:00.980 --> 28:01.340]  Just never.
[28:01.640 --> 28:02.240]  Early Rooster Teeth days.
[28:02.620 --> 28:03.360]  And then lost touch.
[28:03.500 --> 28:06.180]  And then we end up married to the same sisters.
[28:07.260 --> 28:07.980]  So bizarre.
[28:08.100 --> 28:09.060]  I was wondering how you were going to word that.
[28:09.080 --> 28:09.620]  I got nervous.
[28:09.880 --> 28:10.020]  Yeah.
[28:12.000 --> 28:12.360]  Ken.
[28:14.820 --> 28:15.380]  Anything good?
[28:15.500 --> 28:15.840]  Anything good?
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.140]  Anyway, it's his goal.
[28:17.240 --> 28:17.880]  What'd you get?
[28:18.040 --> 28:18.860]  It's his goal.
[28:18.980 --> 28:19.820]  He wants to go to every...
[28:19.820 --> 28:21.220]  To go to every Major League Baseball stadium.
[28:21.380 --> 28:21.780]  He's pretty close.
[28:22.500 --> 28:23.900]  Alex Kirilov autograph.
[28:24.360 --> 28:24.660]  Cool.
[28:25.100 --> 28:25.680]  That's pretty cool.
[28:25.740 --> 28:26.000]  Who's that?
[28:26.120 --> 28:26.500]  Anybody good?
[28:26.960 --> 28:27.960]  He's a Minnesota twin.
[28:28.220 --> 28:32.900]  I mean, it's the twins, so they're like, you know.
[28:33.020 --> 28:35.340]  What's the baseball team that you forget about the most?
[28:36.380 --> 28:36.780]  The...
[28:36.780 --> 28:37.300]  The twins are up there.
[28:37.360 --> 28:39.660]  Yeah, it's always in the AL Central.
[28:40.160 --> 28:41.520]  It's like the twins...
[28:42.280 --> 28:43.040]  Kansas City Royals.
[28:43.040 --> 28:44.180]  Yeah, Kansas City's in there.
[28:44.180 --> 28:45.460]  They might as well not exist.
[28:45.620 --> 28:46.360]  Alika Williams.
[28:47.400 --> 28:48.120]  Adley Rutschman.
[28:48.560 --> 28:48.900]  Oh!
[28:49.780 --> 28:50.500]  Nolan Ryan.
[28:51.680 --> 28:53.240]  I feel like it's the teams in the Central.
[28:53.320 --> 28:54.200]  Jason Dominguez.
[28:54.300 --> 28:54.720]  That I forget about.
[28:54.760 --> 28:55.440]  But not like the NL.
[28:55.440 --> 28:57.180]  I feel like the NL I got, like, pretty locked down.
[28:57.260 --> 28:58.160]  It's just the AL is just not...
[28:58.160 --> 28:59.420]  What was the one you said before that?
[29:00.180 --> 29:00.840]  The AL?
[29:01.340 --> 29:02.000]  Oh, the twins.
[29:02.000 --> 29:02.960]  The twins are up there.
[29:03.120 --> 29:04.820]  And then the Royals.
[29:05.100 --> 29:06.520]  Those are two teams where you just go...
[29:06.520 --> 29:07.160]  What are the Royals?
[29:07.240 --> 29:07.800]  Like, what's their mascot?
[29:09.200 --> 29:09.560]  Crown?
[29:09.740 --> 29:10.140]  No, no, no.
[29:10.180 --> 29:10.640]  It's a...
[29:10.640 --> 29:12.400]  It's a lion.
[29:13.660 --> 29:15.680]  King of the Jungle kind of situation.
[29:16.960 --> 29:18.240]  I think they just switched over.
[29:18.400 --> 29:19.400]  They were a huge sponsor.
[29:20.140 --> 29:22.120]  Like, Pepsi was a huge sponsor for them.
[29:22.340 --> 29:25.380]  And I think they just ended that and Coke picked them up right away.
[29:26.120 --> 29:27.120]  They just went, ha ha!
[29:27.600 --> 29:28.200]  Fuck you.
[29:28.340 --> 29:29.960]  Do you think Coke will pick the show up?
[29:32.760 --> 29:33.600]  Uh, they...
[29:33.600 --> 29:34.400]  Hey, Coke.
[29:34.800 --> 29:35.000]  Hey.
[29:35.500 --> 29:36.280]  Pepsi dropped us.
[29:36.420 --> 29:37.100]  I mean, either...
[29:37.100 --> 29:37.740]  If you're interested in sponsoring...
[29:37.740 --> 29:39.820]  Either the soda or the drug.
[29:39.960 --> 29:40.940]  That's what that...
[29:40.940 --> 29:42.380]  We'll get through all these cards real quick.
[29:42.380 --> 29:43.160]  Whatever it takes.
[29:43.820 --> 29:45.160]  I'm just smoking six.
[29:45.180 --> 29:46.600]  I have all these business ideas.
[29:47.740 --> 29:48.620]  Here we go.
[29:48.780 --> 29:50.460]  Garrett Cole, Major League Material.
[29:50.940 --> 29:51.180]  Ooh, nice.
[29:51.300 --> 29:53.440]  That is a game-used memorabilia.
[29:53.780 --> 29:55.340]  Garrett Cole, best pitcher in baseball.
[29:55.360 --> 29:59.140]  I mean, he really figured it out because for a while he was not Major League Material.
[29:59.420 --> 30:02.420]  I wish they would have just shifted that fucking patch just...
[30:02.420 --> 30:03.040]  Just a little bit.
[30:03.080 --> 30:03.900]  It's also two colors.
[30:03.920 --> 30:06.260]  Just rotate it because then he would have had a line.
[30:06.680 --> 30:06.920]  Yeah.
[30:07.140 --> 30:07.720]  That's pretty nice.
[30:07.760 --> 30:08.240]  Too confusing.
[30:09.000 --> 30:09.440]  Pretty.
[30:09.920 --> 30:10.740]  It would have tricked Geoff.
[30:10.740 --> 30:11.320]  Pretty.
[30:12.000 --> 30:12.360]  Pretty.
[30:12.440 --> 30:12.740]  Pretty.
[30:12.820 --> 30:13.080]  Nice.
[30:13.860 --> 30:14.720]  Oh, here we go.
[30:15.420 --> 30:16.900]  Rainbow Foil, Seattle Mariners.
[30:16.980 --> 30:17.660]  That's a group hug.
[30:17.900 --> 30:18.400]  I'm fun.
[30:19.600 --> 30:20.320]  Christopher Morrill.
[30:20.740 --> 30:20.880]  Like that.
[30:21.060 --> 30:22.940]  Apparently they're saving him right now.
[30:23.020 --> 30:23.180]  Yep.
[30:23.300 --> 30:23.400]  Wow.
[30:24.740 --> 30:25.420]  You know how they do it?
[30:25.560 --> 30:26.580]  They go like, Jesus.
[30:28.420 --> 30:29.280]  Tony Gwynn again.
[30:29.440 --> 30:29.800]  Hey.
[30:29.980 --> 30:30.260]  Hey.
[30:30.940 --> 30:32.640]  Chad had a great point and then it disappeared.
[30:32.960 --> 30:34.960]  The team I forget about the most is the Cleveland Guardians.
[30:35.340 --> 30:35.700]  Oh.
[30:35.780 --> 30:35.960]  Oh.
[30:36.280 --> 30:36.800]  That's a good call.
[30:37.280 --> 30:38.040]  What were they before?
[30:38.220 --> 30:38.740]  The Indians.
[30:38.740 --> 30:38.900]  The Indians.
[30:39.240 --> 30:39.600]  Okay.
[30:39.960 --> 30:43.620]  And now they're the Guardians and I forget that they exist because I go, oh, the twins
[30:43.620 --> 30:44.260]  and that other team.
[30:44.360 --> 30:44.880]  Who's the other team?
[30:44.980 --> 30:45.120]  Yeah.
[30:45.400 --> 30:46.900]  And it's the Cleveland Guardians.
[30:47.040 --> 30:47.460]  It'll take time.
[30:47.920 --> 30:49.080]  Wasn't that the team from Major League?
[30:49.360 --> 30:49.660]  Yes.
[30:49.900 --> 30:51.100]  It's my favorite movie.
[30:52.140 --> 30:52.860]  It's a good movie.
[30:53.100 --> 30:53.780]  It's my favorite.
[30:55.080 --> 30:55.880]  It's Eric's favorite.
[30:56.020 --> 30:56.960]  You can't like it.
[30:56.960 --> 30:57.600]  It's his favorite.
[30:57.800 --> 30:58.880]  You can like it.
[30:58.880 --> 30:59.280]  He claimed it.
[30:59.580 --> 31:00.220]  But it can't be your favorite.
[31:00.220 --> 31:00.860]  You can like it.
[31:00.920 --> 31:02.340]  When you say it's a good movie, it is.
[31:02.460 --> 31:02.800]  You're right.
[31:04.400 --> 31:07.060]  Ryan Presley, Curtis Meade, Matt McClain.
[31:07.960 --> 31:11.480]  I hate those pirate City Connects.
[31:11.540 --> 31:12.180]  They're so ugly.
[31:12.680 --> 31:14.420]  Most City Connects are ugly, I've decided.
[31:14.940 --> 31:15.400]  What is this?
[31:15.640 --> 31:16.400]  Is that what you decided?
[31:16.440 --> 31:16.920]  I like the Padres when they have the...
[31:16.920 --> 31:17.940]  2024 bronze.
[31:18.480 --> 31:19.300]  The colors on the sleeves?
[31:19.500 --> 31:19.600]  Yeah.
[31:19.940 --> 31:20.420]  Ah, here we go.
[31:20.460 --> 31:21.080]  Another Garrett Cole.
[31:21.260 --> 31:21.940]  Here's a rainbow foil.
[31:22.060 --> 31:24.440]  Not nearly as cool as the patch.
[31:24.920 --> 31:26.880]  Jackie Robinson, Grand Gamers.
[31:26.940 --> 31:26.980]  Oh, that's cool.
[31:26.980 --> 31:29.260]  Kristen Yellick, 35th throwback.
[31:29.740 --> 31:31.400]  Emmett Sheehan, base rookie.
[31:32.240 --> 31:33.060]  Not looking for...
[31:34.200 --> 31:34.840]  Hell of a lot.
[31:34.920 --> 31:35.100]  I'm sorry.
[31:35.100 --> 31:37.660]  All right, this is going to wrap this up and then we'll do our silver packs.
[31:37.680 --> 31:38.560]  We got those silver packs.
[31:38.660 --> 31:42.000]  That's where hopefully the money will be.
[31:42.960 --> 31:44.100]  And then you could...
[31:44.100 --> 31:46.060]  You'll maybe put that up on eBay, huh?
[31:46.180 --> 31:46.520]  If anything.
[31:46.640 --> 31:47.540]  We're going to change the name.
[31:47.780 --> 31:49.060]  And then what's the name of that eBay account?
[31:49.080 --> 31:49.880]  We're going to change it, it doesn't matter.
[31:50.000 --> 31:50.740]  It's going to be changed.
[31:50.880 --> 31:52.540]  Geoff Ramsey Collect Apples.
[31:54.880 --> 31:56.380]  Which is an acceptable spelling.
[31:56.640 --> 31:57.300]  I didn't name it.
[31:57.440 --> 31:58.100]  According to...
[31:58.800 --> 31:59.180]  The internet.
[31:59.560 --> 32:00.480]  According to my wife.
[32:01.000 --> 32:01.840]  I don't know.
[32:02.300 --> 32:03.100]  Who did the footwork.
[32:03.860 --> 32:04.640]  And you did a great job.
[32:04.640 --> 32:05.400]  She did a great job.
[32:05.440 --> 32:06.080]  I'm not complaining.
[32:06.240 --> 32:08.580]  Well, I thought that I could change the name like immediately.
[32:10.300 --> 32:11.060]  But I couldn't.
[32:11.940 --> 32:13.400]  And I did it all by myself.
[32:13.500 --> 32:14.620]  I did that on my Blizzard account.
[32:14.740 --> 32:15.820]  I thought you could change your name a lot.
[32:15.900 --> 32:17.320]  So now I'm stuck as Spider-Man Dad.
[32:19.500 --> 32:21.820]  They're like, oh no, you can change it like twice and then it costs money.
[32:21.860 --> 32:23.120]  And I went, oh no.
[32:23.580 --> 32:24.520]  I'm Spider-Man Dad.
[32:24.780 --> 32:26.000]  30 days should be up soon.
[32:26.180 --> 32:26.840]  Yeah, pretty close.
[32:29.120 --> 32:29.760]  Sideburns Mattingly.
[32:30.380 --> 32:31.460]  Christian Yellick again.
[32:31.880 --> 32:33.220]  Here's Jazz Chisholm Jr.
[32:33.340 --> 32:34.240]  Best name in baseball.
[32:34.240 --> 32:37.640]  Did you see his interview where he threw everyone under the bus?
[32:38.120 --> 32:38.480]  No.
[32:38.600 --> 32:39.640]  Yeah, it was really good.
[32:39.680 --> 32:39.880]  Why?
[32:40.260 --> 32:44.940]  He was on some podcasts and he was just like, that team had leaders that were not leaders.
[32:45.120 --> 32:46.880]  They were just in the league for a long time.
[32:47.160 --> 32:49.560]  And it was like, people were like narrowing it down.
[32:49.640 --> 32:50.220]  It was really cool.
[32:50.420 --> 32:50.840]  It was great.
[32:50.920 --> 32:51.560]  Who was he talking about?
[32:51.580 --> 32:52.200]  I love a hater.
[32:52.480 --> 32:54.180]  So it was pretty cool.
[32:54.380 --> 32:54.900]  I don't remember.
[32:55.040 --> 32:55.500]  It was great.
[32:57.280 --> 32:58.000]  Aaron Judge.
[32:58.100 --> 32:59.680]  Heard a lot of chatter about him recently.
[32:59.840 --> 33:01.260]  Apparently he's got a lot of potential.
[33:01.500 --> 33:02.740]  People think he could be good.
[33:02.900 --> 33:02.960]  Nope.
[33:02.960 --> 33:04.040]  Mike Schmidt.
[33:04.340 --> 33:07.180]  There's another young, up-and-coming Philly player.
[33:07.260 --> 33:08.100]  Mike Schmidt.
[33:08.260 --> 33:09.660]  He's gonna crush it this year.
[33:10.400 --> 33:12.920]  He's ready for opening day.
[33:13.520 --> 33:14.120]  He's old.
[33:14.260 --> 33:14.680]  He played a long time.
[33:14.860 --> 33:15.200]  Oh, yeah.
[33:16.660 --> 33:18.000]  Marco Luciano rookie.
[33:18.140 --> 33:23.260]  That'd be cool if it was Henry Davis or Jason Dominguez or Ellie.
[33:23.700 --> 33:24.740]  And then Randy Rosarino.
[33:24.860 --> 33:27.340]  I gotta say, overall, pretty mid.
[33:27.440 --> 33:28.000]  Pretty mild.
[33:28.260 --> 33:29.060]  Pretty mid-box.
[33:29.960 --> 33:30.900]  Got some more shit to open.
[33:30.920 --> 33:31.320]  What you got?
[33:32.080 --> 33:33.360]  Let's fuck with Baskin.
[33:33.440 --> 33:34.620]  I don't have any Allen and Gibson.
[33:34.920 --> 33:35.280]  You know what?
[33:35.460 --> 33:36.340]  Do you want to look and see what's in here?
[33:36.380 --> 33:37.280]  I couldn't find any in here.
[33:37.400 --> 33:38.640]  There probably is.
[33:38.840 --> 33:38.980]  This is cool.
[33:39.660 --> 33:40.220]  I'm on the hunt.
[33:40.320 --> 33:44.340]  After going to see the Spurs live, I'm on the hunt for some cool Zach Collins cards.
[33:44.800 --> 33:45.940]  He's my favorite player.
[33:46.160 --> 33:47.500]  I hope I can hook you up.
[33:47.540 --> 33:49.540]  He's the funniest player on the Spurs.
[33:50.100 --> 33:50.200]  Yeah.
[33:50.240 --> 33:51.000]  Which one was he?
[33:51.260 --> 33:52.480]  He's the white guy.
[33:52.960 --> 33:54.920]  He's the white guy with the haircut who...
[33:54.920 --> 33:55.620]  From the 40s.
[33:55.620 --> 34:02.340]  Who decided that his best defense was to play 10 feet off Nicola Jokic.
[34:02.780 --> 34:04.800]  And he was just draining threes.
[34:05.360 --> 34:06.940]  It's like, oh, that's not how this works, bud.
[34:07.300 --> 34:09.000]  You should probably get a hand in there.
[34:09.240 --> 34:11.220]  He looks like an NBA player from the 50s.
[34:11.640 --> 34:14.540]  It's very funny that he is on the Spurs.
[34:15.200 --> 34:15.880]  Dylan Brooks.
[34:16.300 --> 34:17.020]  Oh, hell yeah.
[34:17.440 --> 34:17.880]  That's...
[34:17.880 --> 34:18.780]  You want to talk about haters?
[34:19.000 --> 34:20.560]  He's the bad kind of hater.
[34:20.860 --> 34:22.940]  Who did he just get into a fight with?
[34:22.940 --> 34:23.700]  He just...
[34:24.160 --> 34:24.600]  Fuck.
[34:24.600 --> 34:25.580]  That was like two days ago.
[34:25.640 --> 34:27.020]  Yeah, they were like shoving each other and stuff.
[34:27.020 --> 34:27.640]  Oh, it was Golden State.
[34:27.840 --> 34:28.160]  No.
[34:28.660 --> 34:29.280]  It was Indiana.
[34:29.460 --> 34:29.820]  I don't remember.
[34:29.860 --> 34:30.460]  It was...
[34:31.780 --> 34:32.420]  Charles Barkley.
[34:33.400 --> 34:33.720]  Fucking...
[34:33.720 --> 34:34.260]  Is he any good?
[34:35.040 --> 34:35.680]  Silver prism.
[34:35.880 --> 34:36.780]  Did he win any champions?
[34:37.360 --> 34:38.500]  Is that a Sixers jersey?
[34:38.760 --> 34:39.800]  Did Charles Barkley ever win one?
[34:39.840 --> 34:40.080]  No.
[34:40.240 --> 34:40.460]  I know.
[34:40.620 --> 34:43.060]  Yeah, that's when he was Sir Charles.
[34:43.240 --> 34:44.060]  Do you think of him?
[34:44.160 --> 34:45.140]  What do you think of him?
[34:45.300 --> 34:46.420]  I think of him as a Sixer.
[34:46.620 --> 34:46.880]  Really?
[34:47.080 --> 34:51.940]  Yeah, because I was a huge fan of him as a child.
[34:52.080 --> 34:53.340]  Well, I've told the story about meeting him and stuff.
[34:53.340 --> 34:53.820]  Yes, yes, yes.
[34:53.820 --> 34:58.180]  But he was from Alabama and I was from Alabama, so I was hyper aware of Charles.
[34:58.400 --> 35:01.360]  And so, I fell in love with him as a Sixer.
[35:01.560 --> 35:02.940]  And so, he will always be a Sixer to me.
[35:03.020 --> 35:03.300]  That's fun.
[35:03.480 --> 35:04.400]  Sixer or the Suns.
[35:04.400 --> 35:05.460]  I think of him as a Sun.
[35:05.700 --> 35:08.120]  Yeah, I think arguably more success as a Sun, but...
[35:08.120 --> 35:08.400]  Yeah.
[35:08.940 --> 35:09.600]  It was...
[35:09.600 --> 35:09.940]  I don't know.
[35:11.060 --> 35:12.160]  Definitely think of him as a Sun.
[35:12.200 --> 35:13.300]  Big Sixer energy for me.
[35:14.220 --> 35:14.580]  Kuminga!
[35:15.600 --> 35:16.040]  I don't have it.
[35:16.560 --> 35:17.280]  Kobe Bufkin.
[35:17.380 --> 35:18.000]  I'm sorry.
[35:18.580 --> 35:18.960]  It's okay.
[35:19.080 --> 35:19.720]  Kevin Love.
[35:19.840 --> 35:21.260]  Color match if he was on a different team.
[35:22.460 --> 35:23.180]  Yuta Watanabe.
[35:23.820 --> 35:25.140]  Let's see what else we got.
[35:28.520 --> 35:29.640]  Is that Watanabe?
[35:30.640 --> 35:32.240]  And you said...
[35:32.240 --> 35:32.720]  Watanabe?
[35:32.860 --> 35:33.300]  Watanabe?
[35:33.500 --> 35:33.860]  Watanabe?
[35:34.100 --> 35:34.400]  I don't know.
[35:35.040 --> 35:35.900]  He doesn't play.
[35:36.100 --> 35:36.680]  Nothing matters.
[35:36.940 --> 35:37.320]  Paul George.
[35:38.180 --> 35:38.660]  Joker.
[35:39.420 --> 35:40.300]  Martin Bagley.
[35:40.940 --> 35:41.720]  Kevin Hurter.
[35:42.700 --> 35:46.360]  I think PG-13 is the funniest nickname in the league because it sucks.
[35:47.900 --> 35:48.700]  Paul George.
[35:48.800 --> 35:49.560]  And I'm number 13.
[35:49.660 --> 35:50.260]  PG-13.
[35:50.460 --> 35:51.600]  Yeah, you thought about this too hard.
[35:51.600 --> 35:56.820]  Also, he got in trouble on Twitter a couple years ago for some pretty non-PG things he said.
[35:56.880 --> 35:57.500]  Oh, that's fine.
[35:57.620 --> 35:58.060]  What'd he say?
[36:00.880 --> 36:01.880]  I'll tell you later.
[36:03.280 --> 36:04.200]  Jaden Ivey.
[36:04.660 --> 36:05.760]  Ben Shepard.
[36:06.800 --> 36:07.720]  Tracy McGrady.
[36:08.900 --> 36:11.400]  When you think of TMAC, what team do you think I'm playing for?
[36:12.940 --> 36:14.380]  Let me see his card.
[36:18.320 --> 36:19.240]  I mean...
[36:20.520 --> 36:21.480]  He's a Raptor.
[36:21.880 --> 36:24.900]  What I don't think of him looking like is that, though.
[36:25.020 --> 36:25.180]  Yeah.
[36:25.380 --> 36:26.240]  I don't...
[36:27.220 --> 36:28.540]  Purple jersey standout.
[36:28.660 --> 36:30.680]  He doesn't look that skinny or thin or whatever.
[36:31.460 --> 36:32.200]  Caseon Wallace.
[36:32.560 --> 36:33.540]  James Nagy.
[36:33.700 --> 36:34.480]  Max Strews.
[36:34.800 --> 36:39.600]  I like Austin Reeves when he got, like, dunked on and then got asked,
[36:39.720 --> 36:40.920]  hey, what was it like to get dunked on?
[36:41.600 --> 36:44.000]  And he just went, I mean, what the fuck?
[36:44.400 --> 36:46.400]  He told the reporter, this is why I don't like you.
[36:47.020 --> 36:47.880]  Oh my god.
[36:47.880 --> 36:48.600]  I thought that was great.
[36:49.220 --> 36:50.000]  Emmanuel Co...
[36:51.220 --> 36:51.700]  Quickly.
[36:52.760 --> 36:53.680]  Brandon Ingram.
[36:54.920 --> 36:55.880]  Dariq Whitehead.
[36:56.020 --> 36:56.560]  And Nas Reed.
[36:56.680 --> 36:57.520]  That is a...
[36:58.160 --> 37:00.660]  Just a dog ship blaster.
[37:00.900 --> 37:07.900]  How are you feeling about Zion losing all that weight and fucking hammering down basketballs and being a team to watch?
[37:08.600 --> 37:12.240]  It's interesting because everybody has given up on Zion and nobody's been watching him,
[37:12.240 --> 37:15.260]  but he has quietly put together a really, really solid season.
[37:15.280 --> 37:16.600]  All of a sudden, it's really good.
[37:16.600 --> 37:17.840]  They've been winning some games.
[37:17.960 --> 37:18.740]  They're, like, making moves.
[37:19.080 --> 37:21.280]  Seeing the Rockets in, like, their last...
[37:21.280 --> 37:22.600]  Rockets are 10 in the last 11.
[37:22.720 --> 37:22.920]  Yeah.
[37:23.040 --> 37:24.300]  They're going to sneak in to the playoffs.
[37:24.320 --> 37:25.180]  Oh, I totally agree.
[37:25.500 --> 37:26.380]  I absolutely agree.
[37:26.480 --> 37:28.980]  And they're doing all that with Alperin Sangun, who's out right now.
[37:29.800 --> 37:30.160]  Crazy.
[37:30.280 --> 37:30.460]  Crazy.
[37:30.620 --> 37:32.040]  And I think Cam Whitmore might be out as well.
[37:34.780 --> 37:35.500]  Oce Agbaje.
[37:36.460 --> 37:37.520]  De'Aaron Fox.
[37:38.180 --> 37:38.540]  Dominance.
[37:39.500 --> 37:39.860]  Oliver.
[37:40.900 --> 37:41.620]  Mackenz Prosper.
[37:42.040 --> 37:42.400]  Rookie.
[37:43.420 --> 37:43.780]  Silver.
[37:44.820 --> 37:45.720]  Cracked Ice, I guess.
[37:46.600 --> 37:48.440]  John Castleton, I've never heard of in my life.
[37:48.500 --> 37:49.620]  That's a lanky guy.
[37:49.760 --> 37:50.760]  He plays for the Lakers, apparently.
[37:50.900 --> 37:51.620]  Long neck.
[37:52.980 --> 37:54.360]  It is a long neck.
[37:54.860 --> 37:55.700]  Josh Giddey.
[37:55.960 --> 37:56.600]  Julius Randle.
[37:57.400 --> 37:58.440]  Jimmy Butler.
[37:58.620 --> 37:59.320]  Gary Payton.
[37:59.740 --> 37:59.880]  Yeah.
[38:00.100 --> 38:00.980]  Big Josh Giddey head.
[38:01.640 --> 38:03.460]  See the Oklahoma City Thunder guy?
[38:03.820 --> 38:04.500]  He is.
[38:04.620 --> 38:04.940]  He is.
[38:05.040 --> 38:06.800]  Yeah, he's a Timothee Chalamet-looking dude.
[38:07.480 --> 38:08.760]  Certainly for some ladies.
[38:10.080 --> 38:11.120]  Christos Porzingis.
[38:11.260 --> 38:11.520]  He was.
[38:12.360 --> 38:13.640]  Donovan Spider-Mitchell.
[38:13.760 --> 38:14.220]  Silver.
[38:14.600 --> 38:15.280]  Big fan.
[38:15.280 --> 38:15.960]  SGA.
[38:16.040 --> 38:17.220]  Certain ages and stuff, you know?
[38:17.320 --> 38:17.680]  Hey!
[38:18.040 --> 38:18.720]  Jordan Walsh.
[38:18.880 --> 38:19.640]  Celtics rookie.
[38:20.100 --> 38:20.620]  Love him.
[38:20.720 --> 38:21.920]  He's never going to get to play.
[38:22.780 --> 38:23.940]  He plays a lot at the end.
[38:23.960 --> 38:26.880]  He played garbage time in the last two of the last three games.
[38:26.960 --> 38:27.360]  It's been great.
[38:27.740 --> 38:30.520]  Thankfully they've gotten to garbage time at like the halfway mark.
[38:31.060 --> 38:34.340]  Yeah, Celtics just locked up first place in the Eastern Division.
[38:34.340 --> 38:34.860]  That's great, man.
[38:35.440 --> 38:36.240]  Now let's see how they do.
[38:37.240 --> 38:40.180]  Hopefully they stay warm and play in the playoffs.
[38:41.320 --> 38:44.120]  I'm trying to think of who on the East Coast I'm fucking scared of if I'm the Celtics right now.
[38:45.160 --> 38:47.040]  I'm no longer scared of the mighty Heat.
[38:47.200 --> 38:47.920]  Fuck them.
[38:49.120 --> 38:51.340]  Philadelphia's a shell, thanks to the Embiid injury.
[38:51.460 --> 38:55.340]  And even when they had them, we've had their number for so long, it's embarrassing.
[38:57.360 --> 38:58.620]  All right, you know what?
[38:59.200 --> 39:00.560]  The Bucs are putting it together right now.
[39:02.840 --> 39:05.160]  Yeah, Cleveland has kind of hit a wall.
[39:05.520 --> 39:06.520]  I'm not really worried about anybody.
[39:07.180 --> 39:08.900]  You just want someone to be able to clip that.
[39:11.300 --> 39:12.380]  I'm a little worried about Denver.
[39:12.720 --> 39:13.560]  But they're in the West.
[39:13.560 --> 39:14.560]  I'm worried about the finals.
[39:14.700 --> 39:16.880]  But we're going to sail to the finals.
[39:17.520 --> 39:18.220]  I think.
[39:19.180 --> 39:19.980]  Duncan Robinson.
[39:20.440 --> 39:21.280]  A little caveat on that.
[39:21.300 --> 39:22.920]  Just to make sure it's okay.
[39:24.680 --> 39:26.200]  Dusanamu has been really good.
[39:26.300 --> 39:28.740]  He's been averaging over 30 points a game for the last couple weeks.
[39:28.760 --> 39:29.440]  That's crazy.
[39:29.500 --> 39:30.080]  Out of the blue, yeah.
[39:30.320 --> 39:35.260]  Him and Colby White have been such a bright spot for such a sad team.
[39:35.480 --> 39:36.640]  Just a sad, sad team.
[39:37.480 --> 39:38.760]  Aaron Rodgers never liked him.
[39:39.180 --> 39:40.100]  Cason Wallace again.
[39:40.600 --> 39:41.900]  Aaron Rodgers and Aaron Gordon.
[39:41.960 --> 39:43.080]  Aaron Rodgers and Aaron Gordon.
[39:43.480 --> 39:44.400]  There's White Chocolate.
[39:46.580 --> 39:48.940]  That's the guy I make you watch videos on YouTube of.
[39:49.020 --> 39:49.680]  Oh, I like him.
[39:50.860 --> 39:52.520]  But he doesn't play anymore, does he?
[39:52.660 --> 39:53.540]  No, not for a long time.
[39:54.000 --> 39:54.580]  He plays in like...
[39:54.580 --> 39:56.120]  He does have like the Nellick passes and stuff.
[39:56.120 --> 39:57.720]  He plays in like pro-ams and shit, I think.
[39:59.460 --> 40:00.120]  Tim Hardaway.
[40:00.840 --> 40:03.720]  Here is a Dominance Bradley Beal green parallel.
[40:04.020 --> 40:05.000]  That is...
[40:05.920 --> 40:06.620]  Ugly card.
[40:07.280 --> 40:07.680]  That's...
[40:07.680 --> 40:08.480]  That sucks.
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.240]  That pose kind of sucks.
[40:10.320 --> 40:11.980]  Everything about that card sucks.
[40:12.060 --> 40:12.860]  Sorry, Bradley Beal.
[40:13.560 --> 40:14.380]  Yeah, that's okay.
[40:14.520 --> 40:15.220]  He's a...
[40:15.220 --> 40:17.500]  I don't want to say Bradley Beal sucks, but you know.
[40:17.580 --> 40:18.220]  It is what it is.
[40:18.280 --> 40:19.940]  Jalen Slauson, THT.
[40:20.720 --> 40:21.680]  We got one more.
[40:23.340 --> 40:23.740]  Maybe...
[40:24.580 --> 40:26.320]  Are you putting your card down there, Emily?
[40:26.520 --> 40:26.720]  Yep.
[40:26.840 --> 40:29.480]  This is a card for your podcast, Clutch My Pearls.
[40:29.720 --> 40:33.260]  Available now everywhere that you get podcasts and also a video version on YouTube.
[40:33.640 --> 40:33.800]  Yep.
[40:33.900 --> 40:36.300]  And we have a Patreon now to support Eric's small wife.
[40:36.340 --> 40:37.200]  Well, you can't...
[40:37.200 --> 40:38.380]  Don't talk about Patreon here.
[40:39.300 --> 40:40.080]  I don't...
[40:40.080 --> 40:40.780]  I'm not an employee.
[40:41.260 --> 40:42.400]  I don't fucking work here.
[40:43.660 --> 40:45.660]  I just show up and get cutie cuffs.
[40:46.300 --> 40:46.740]  What?
[40:47.220 --> 40:49.260]  Emily's like, I was told I'd be paid in cutie cuffs.
[40:49.440 --> 40:49.740]  Yeah.
[40:50.240 --> 40:50.680]  You did.
[40:50.780 --> 40:51.540]  You made an Eeyore.
[40:51.700 --> 40:52.100]  Congratulations.
[40:53.100 --> 40:54.120]  He bashes me.
[40:54.640 --> 40:55.540]  What did I just read?
[40:55.640 --> 40:56.900]  Was it...
[40:56.900 --> 40:59.440]  Miles Turner that's played the most minutes in the season?
[41:00.420 --> 41:00.820]  Really?
[41:01.120 --> 41:01.420]  Maybe.
[41:01.520 --> 41:02.580]  Maybe not.
[41:03.500 --> 41:04.300]  Rui Hachimura.
[41:04.460 --> 41:06.800]  If it wasn't him, it was somebody very similar to Miles Turner.
[41:08.440 --> 41:09.320]  Noah Clowney.
[41:09.820 --> 41:10.260]  Silver.
[41:11.680 --> 41:12.400]  Prism rookie.
[41:12.560 --> 41:13.180]  That would be cool.
[41:14.560 --> 41:19.460]  Would be Gary Payton, who's maybe...
[41:19.460 --> 41:21.840]  How do you feel about Defensive Player of the Year this year?
[41:24.200 --> 41:26.140]  It should be probably Rudy Gay.
[41:26.720 --> 41:27.500]  Rudy Gay, I'm sorry.
[41:28.160 --> 41:28.300]  Rudy Gobert.
[41:28.420 --> 41:29.460]  Rudy Gobert, not Rudy Gay.
[41:29.620 --> 41:30.700]  Rudy Gay's good, too.
[41:30.980 --> 41:31.920]  He's not a Defensive Player of the Year.
[41:32.440 --> 41:35.220]  I know that people are making a case for Wimby.
[41:35.380 --> 41:38.760]  And I think Wimby will probably win Defensive Player of the Year seven, six years in a row.
[41:38.760 --> 41:41.320]  Yeah, I think he's got plenty of time to make that happen.
[41:41.460 --> 41:45.700]  But it's hard to win Defensive Player of the Year when you're on one of the four worst teams.
[41:46.820 --> 41:48.060]  It's hard to make a case for it.
[41:48.080 --> 41:50.960]  OG Anobe, playing for his old team, the Raptors.
[41:51.620 --> 41:52.420]  Onyeka Okonkwo.
[41:54.320 --> 41:55.660]  Jalen Hitchufina again.
[41:55.860 --> 41:57.540]  Mike Miles Jr.
[41:58.080 --> 41:58.760]  Man, it would be so...
[41:58.760 --> 41:59.680]  Oh, a Care Bear.
[42:00.160 --> 42:01.020]  Where'd that come from?
[42:01.480 --> 42:02.540]  I found him over here.
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.840]  It would be so cool if we got a hit.
[42:05.200 --> 42:06.700]  By the way, this is our third box.
[42:07.540 --> 42:08.740]  No Wimby's so far.
[42:08.740 --> 42:09.580]  Nothing.
[42:09.740 --> 42:11.380]  No Brandon Millers.
[42:11.540 --> 42:12.720]  No Scoot Henderson's.
[42:12.900 --> 42:15.580]  No Blake Lively II's.
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.780]  No, uh...
[42:17.780 --> 42:18.620]  Blake Lively?
[42:18.980 --> 42:19.680]  Blake Lively.
[42:19.880 --> 42:20.320]  Isn't that his name?
[42:20.720 --> 42:21.060]  Sure.
[42:21.640 --> 42:24.460]  The one who just apologized for all her Kate Middleton tweets?
[42:24.460 --> 42:28.100]  The one that ended every game with XOXO.
[42:29.400 --> 42:30.380]  Jabari Smith.
[42:31.260 --> 42:32.560]  Oh, here we got Scoot Henderson, Emergent.
[42:32.640 --> 42:32.980]  That's trash.
[42:33.740 --> 42:34.480]  Lugan's Dort.
[42:34.520 --> 42:35.200]  Is he wearing a shirt?
[42:36.120 --> 42:38.240]  Yeah, he's probably wearing like a...
[42:38.740 --> 42:40.420]  What little toys we have around here.
[42:40.480 --> 42:41.280]  He's had a rough first season.
[42:43.040 --> 42:44.780]  Everybody associated with Portland's had a rough year.
[42:46.060 --> 42:46.860]  DeAndre Ayton.
[42:47.260 --> 42:48.900]  It would suck to be Chauncey Billups, man.
[42:49.040 --> 42:49.540]  Mm-hmm.
[42:49.540 --> 42:51.400]  Fucking, hey, come coach Dame.
[42:51.960 --> 42:52.560]  Ha, just kidding.
[42:53.260 --> 42:54.980]  Uh, Max Christie, Klay Thompson.
[42:55.600 --> 42:57.060]  He's, boy, talk about falling off a cliff.
[42:57.180 --> 42:57.380]  Yup.
[42:57.660 --> 42:58.020]  Oof.
[42:58.880 --> 42:59.960]  Cannot figure it out.
[43:00.140 --> 43:01.080]  Forgot how to play basketball.
[43:01.200 --> 43:01.320]  Yeah.
[43:01.680 --> 43:04.420]  He's kind of like the Max Muncy of the Golden State Warriors.
[43:04.740 --> 43:05.260]  That's rude.
[43:05.740 --> 43:08.760]  GG Jackson also had a good, really, really good rookie year so far.
[43:08.900 --> 43:09.560]  Anthony Black, eh.
[43:10.060 --> 43:11.180]  Uh, Anthony Black, eh.
[43:11.760 --> 43:12.720]  Uh, T.H.T. again.
[43:13.780 --> 43:14.740]  Two Anthony Blacks in a row.
[43:18.320 --> 43:18.820]  Here we go.
[43:18.860 --> 43:19.840]  This is going to get a big hit right here.
[43:19.920 --> 43:20.880]  This is going to be our last pack.
[43:21.240 --> 43:22.160]  Last pack mojo.
[43:22.560 --> 43:23.480]  Cade's second year.
[43:23.840 --> 43:24.620]  Nick Smith Jr.
[43:24.880 --> 43:25.820]  Jamal Murray Dominance.
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.760]  And Colin Castleton Bane.
[43:27.820 --> 43:28.100]  Oh, no.
[43:28.100 --> 43:28.120]  Boo.
[43:28.120 --> 43:29.980]  Was this supposed to be like the best box?
[43:31.460 --> 43:35.240]  Those were just blasters, but it would have been nice to have anything in those blasters.
[43:35.240 --> 43:37.480]  What's the best MLP game?
[43:37.480 --> 43:38.420]  Get the Pokeball thing.
[43:38.640 --> 43:39.100]  What's that thing?
[43:39.320 --> 43:40.340]  Yeah, it's another one of those little...
[43:41.500 --> 43:42.760]  Are there any more Cutie Cuffs?
[43:43.080 --> 43:43.520]  No.
[43:46.020 --> 43:47.200]  I never get anything.
[43:47.660 --> 43:48.460]  You have an Eeyore.
[43:48.500 --> 43:50.480]  You're playing with a Care Bear right now.
[43:50.920 --> 43:52.600]  And I love my little magnifier.
[43:53.700 --> 43:57.160]  Oh, you're making the bear look so big.
[43:57.260 --> 43:58.060]  He's so big.
[43:58.080 --> 43:58.700]  He's huge.
[43:58.900 --> 44:00.320]  Fingers crossed we get a LeBron.
[44:01.380 --> 44:02.620]  How did you say that?
[44:02.840 --> 44:04.200]  Fingers crossed we get a LeBron.
[44:04.320 --> 44:04.920]  A LeBron.
[44:05.240 --> 44:06.180]  A LeBron.
[44:06.660 --> 44:08.460]  We came up with a garbage question.
[44:08.620 --> 44:13.120]  Is it garbage if you say adult instead of adult?
[44:13.980 --> 44:15.380]  Because Geoff says adult.
[44:15.740 --> 44:15.960]  Is it?
[44:16.080 --> 44:22.720]  Is your wife garbage if she asks to watch an episode of Cops, but you can't find one that she hasn't seen?
[44:23.100 --> 44:24.020]  That's a good one.
[44:24.020 --> 44:24.780]  In 35 seasons.
[44:24.800 --> 44:25.300]  That's a good one.
[44:26.400 --> 44:27.920]  35 fucking seasons of Cops.
[44:27.920 --> 44:29.180]  Oh, yeah, I've seen this one.
[44:29.780 --> 44:31.160]  And then we'll tell me what's about to happen.
[44:31.160 --> 44:33.540]  I just love the old episodes of Cops.
[44:33.540 --> 44:35.780]  There's so much problematics of it.
[44:35.860 --> 44:41.040]  But it's always like a drunk guy in the front yard who's not surprised to see the Cops there.
[44:42.560 --> 44:42.960]  CP3.
[44:44.280 --> 44:45.640]  His iconic warriors.
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.320]  Well, there you have it.
[44:47.360 --> 44:48.940]  You can see at the bottom here his two left feet.
[44:51.640 --> 44:53.180]  I'm gonna pack him away with this Care Bear.
[44:53.460 --> 44:54.020]  That's good.
[44:54.400 --> 44:56.300]  I would be surprised if he's a warrior next year.
[44:57.760 --> 44:58.200]  Yeah.
[44:59.500 --> 45:00.580]  Put that there.
[45:00.760 --> 45:03.420]  Do you think it is it garbage if you pronounce it Italian?
[45:04.100 --> 45:04.640]  Oh, yeah.
[45:04.780 --> 45:05.380]  Oh, yeah.
[45:06.100 --> 45:07.240]  Do we want to open?
[45:07.320 --> 45:08.200]  This is pretty much all we have left.
[45:08.520 --> 45:13.700]  Topps 2023 Heritage or Topps 2023 High Number Heritage?
[45:14.880 --> 45:15.500]  I wonder what's better.
[45:16.020 --> 45:17.240]  Or this one that's unopened.
[45:17.340 --> 45:18.440]  Let's open the unopened one.
[45:18.620 --> 45:18.860]  Yeah.
[45:19.860 --> 45:24.280]  You don't have any more of the really good MLB one?
[45:24.440 --> 45:25.340]  That was everything.
[45:25.340 --> 45:26.280]  That was the last box.
[45:26.360 --> 45:27.080]  That was the big box.
[45:27.240 --> 45:28.180]  That was everything in the last box?
[45:28.180 --> 45:29.520]  We got a Bat Relic.
[45:29.660 --> 45:32.020]  We got a Derrick Cole Relic.
[45:32.080 --> 45:32.700]  We got that auto.
[45:33.340 --> 45:34.720]  We got this.
[45:36.380 --> 45:37.360]  What it is?
[45:37.900 --> 45:39.300]  Looks like a cracker.
[45:40.620 --> 45:47.560]  This is a Francisco Alvarez Mets rookie card.
[45:50.380 --> 45:53.820]  Fucking on card auto postcard thing.
[45:53.820 --> 45:55.600]  This is so cool.
[45:57.220 --> 45:59.200]  It's just a big card that he signed?
[45:59.200 --> 46:00.820]  It's like a box topper that he signed.
[46:01.900 --> 46:02.360]  That's neat.
[46:03.640 --> 46:06.220]  You can check that out on Geoff's eBay account, maybe.
[46:07.660 --> 46:08.760]  Damn, that's really neat.
[46:09.120 --> 46:09.980]  I'll have to take good care of that.
[46:10.880 --> 46:12.760]  Start looking up Otani updates to see if anything happens.
[46:12.760 --> 46:14.380]  Yeah, let's keep us up to date.
[46:14.420 --> 46:15.060]  Oh, I got you, bud.
[46:15.280 --> 46:16.100]  And then here's what we'll do.
[46:16.160 --> 46:18.920]  We'll open this up because this is going to have one other box topper like that.
[46:20.120 --> 46:21.760]  Otani's only 29 years old.
[46:22.400 --> 46:22.840]  Jesus.
[46:23.060 --> 46:25.780]  Not only. It's a shame that Otani is already 29.
[46:26.660 --> 46:28.900]  Because his MLB career is going to be so short.
[46:29.200 --> 46:30.760]  Well, yeah, it's going to end today with...
[46:32.040 --> 46:32.840]  No, it's not.
[46:32.880 --> 46:33.720]  With his cheating scandal.
[46:33.820 --> 46:34.280]  No, it's not.
[46:34.580 --> 46:36.540]  I don't know why he's cheating. Don't cheat.
[46:37.540 --> 46:38.800]  Do you think that he was innocent?
[46:39.540 --> 46:39.920]  No.
[46:40.480 --> 46:41.800]  Well, didn't you say that...
[46:41.800 --> 46:41.980]  No.
[46:42.140 --> 46:46.120]  I thought it was something where he was helping his friend pay his debts off.
[46:46.120 --> 46:47.120]  Uh, yeah, yeah.
[46:47.240 --> 46:54.180]  You can't, you can't transfer 4.5 million dollars to an illegal betting scheme and go...
[46:54.180 --> 46:56.100]  Fellas, hands are clean on this one.
[46:56.900 --> 46:58.180]  He was helping his friend.
[46:58.200 --> 46:59.360]  He didn't mean to.
[46:59.720 --> 47:00.520]  That's very nice.
[47:00.600 --> 47:03.200]  That's why I run all the red lights to get my friend where he needs to go to faster.
[47:03.220 --> 47:04.100]  If it's an emergency.
[47:05.180 --> 47:08.480]  Look at these, it's like, uh, little postage stamps.
[47:08.840 --> 47:09.220]  Oh, really?
[47:09.480 --> 47:09.740]  Yeah.
[47:09.780 --> 47:10.780]  You think we can mail a letter with them?
[47:11.640 --> 47:12.000]  Maybe.
[47:13.640 --> 47:14.000]  Maybe?
[47:14.180 --> 47:14.800]  Forever stamps.
[47:16.620 --> 47:19.820]  Uh, we'll just, uh, open this and then we'll just...
[47:19.820 --> 47:21.060]  Go through the pack sack!
[47:21.780 --> 47:25.640]  Yeah, open up the pack sack and we'll, uh, we'll just shoot the shit for the last couple minutes.
[47:25.780 --> 47:26.360]  Eloy Jimenez.
[47:26.640 --> 47:30.260]  Or we can just keep going and we'll do that thing like they did in Halo 2 where just they can't end it.
[47:30.340 --> 47:32.400]  They can't end Rooster Teeth if we never stop the break show.
[47:33.340 --> 47:35.620]  I'm gonna find something real good for you, Eric.
[47:35.880 --> 47:36.640]  Oh, cool, thank you.
[47:36.840 --> 47:37.120]  CJ Abrams.
[47:38.620 --> 47:39.540]  I appreciate that.
[47:39.600 --> 47:40.440]  Eh, well, you know.
[47:40.680 --> 47:41.400]  Just for me.
[47:41.480 --> 47:42.120]  Just here to be nice.
[47:42.140 --> 47:43.680]  Check out Clutch My Pearls, my wife's podcast.
[47:44.100 --> 47:44.340]  Yeah.
[47:44.580 --> 47:45.500]  It's also my wife's podcast.
[47:45.500 --> 47:46.040]  What?
[47:46.260 --> 47:47.120]  Oh my God.
[47:47.260 --> 47:48.600]  But don't check it out.
[47:48.840 --> 47:49.600]  I'm kidding, dude.
[47:50.280 --> 47:51.820]  Uh, if you want.
[47:51.960 --> 47:52.240]  Get him, Emily.
[47:54.200 --> 47:54.920]  Andrew McCutcheon.
[47:55.280 --> 47:55.620]  Jose Barrios.
[47:56.660 --> 47:57.980]  I'm glad McCutcheon's a pirate.
[47:59.020 --> 47:59.940]  Jesus, dude.
[48:00.280 --> 48:00.640]  Let's not...
[48:01.500 --> 48:02.060]  Keep doing it.
[48:02.300 --> 48:02.760]  Keep doing it.
[48:02.820 --> 48:03.620]  I don't know.
[48:03.780 --> 48:04.860]  There might be one-on-ones in there.
[48:04.860 --> 48:05.200]  Keep doing it.
[48:05.540 --> 48:06.180]  Please don't.
[48:06.340 --> 48:06.660]  Keep doing it.
[48:07.320 --> 48:08.060]  He's gonna cry.
[48:08.080 --> 48:08.660]  Please don't be a turd.
[48:08.700 --> 48:09.500]  I will cry.
[48:09.660 --> 48:10.180]  He'll cry.
[48:10.180 --> 48:13.520]  Speaking of crying, Eric's about to cry because I'm gonna read these, uh, Norwegian...
[48:13.520 --> 48:14.400]  Ah!
[48:16.210 --> 48:17.520]  Here we have...
[48:17.520 --> 48:18.640]  Hoxho...
[48:18.640 --> 48:19.980]  Onnikahipiota.
[48:21.260 --> 48:22.880]  Uh, oh, uh...
[48:22.880 --> 48:23.560]  Here's...
[48:24.440 --> 48:24.830]  Neabapepi.
[48:25.540 --> 48:26.700]  He plays for...
[48:26.700 --> 48:27.200]  Nenimino.
[48:28.000 --> 48:29.460]  Is that where Andrew's from?
[48:29.540 --> 48:30.000]  Nenimino.
[48:30.020 --> 48:30.520]  And I'm from?
[48:31.120 --> 48:33.000]  Oh, this is Essie...
[48:33.000 --> 48:34.840]  Uh, here's...
[48:34.840 --> 48:35.840]  Rakabnajabo.
[48:36.840 --> 48:37.000]  Who?

[48:39.260 --> 48:39.650]  Haktahan...
[48:40.040 --> 48:40.520]  Aktaweeb.
[48:41.760 --> 48:42.280]  I don't like this.
[48:42.280 --> 48:43.180]  And then...
[48:43.180 --> 48:43.940]  Hopanitob.
[48:44.860 --> 48:45.340]  Sweet.
[48:45.760 --> 48:47.360]  Here's Ultimate Battles.
[48:47.700 --> 48:48.640]  Whatever that is.
[48:49.460 --> 48:50.120]  So, what's up?
[48:50.200 --> 48:52.220]  This is Fisher in the control booth.
[48:52.220 --> 48:54.400]  Oh, you know, there was some Pokemon in here.
[48:54.540 --> 48:55.160]  You can open up that.
[48:55.260 --> 48:56.200]  I know people like that.
[48:58.020 --> 48:59.260]  All right, let's see what we got.
[48:59.940 --> 49:00.700]  Who's into this?
[49:01.780 --> 49:02.260]  The...
[49:02.260 --> 49:03.740]  Did you say Fisher's into the Ultimate Battle?
[49:04.280 --> 49:07.420]  There's an action card of, uh, the thing.
[49:07.660 --> 49:08.060]  Ben Grimm.
[49:08.980 --> 49:09.340]  Ben...
[49:09.340 --> 49:10.000]  Dude, Ben Grimm.
[49:10.120 --> 49:10.700]  Clobberin' time.
[49:10.700 --> 49:12.620]  Uh, there we go.
[49:12.780 --> 49:13.320]  There we go.
[49:13.600 --> 49:14.040]  Cyclops.
[49:14.140 --> 49:14.920]  Uh, there's Reed Richards.
[49:15.120 --> 49:15.720]  He stretches.
[49:16.280 --> 49:16.720]  He does.
[49:17.120 --> 49:17.820]  Stretches a lot.
[49:17.840 --> 49:18.400]  Like Stretch Armstrong.
[49:18.440 --> 49:19.100]  Green Goblin.
[49:19.180 --> 49:22.040]  He throws pumpkins that are on fire.
[49:22.180 --> 49:23.580]  What are the name of, uh, what's his face?
[49:23.580 --> 49:23.800]  Deadpool.
[49:24.260 --> 49:25.220]  He throws quips.
[49:25.520 --> 49:25.940]  He does.
[49:26.600 --> 49:27.960]  Storm throws weather.
[49:28.620 --> 49:30.860]  Cyclops throws laser vision.
[49:32.060 --> 49:33.060]  Here's an overpower card.
[49:34.220 --> 49:35.040]  Those are for who...
[49:35.040 --> 49:35.300]  Oh, Tom.
[49:35.560 --> 49:36.220]  Through his interpreter.
[49:36.620 --> 49:38.620]  It's been a tough week for fans and team officials.
[49:38.620 --> 49:40.960]  I'm grateful the media has been patient.
[49:41.440 --> 49:44.640]  I'm very saddened and shocked that someone I've trusted has done this.
[49:44.800 --> 49:45.480]  Has done what, Joe?
[49:46.220 --> 49:47.100]  You know what.
[49:47.440 --> 49:47.880]  You know.
[49:48.080 --> 49:48.820]  Betrayed his trust.
[49:49.040 --> 49:51.760]  There are things I'm limited in being able to talk about.
[49:51.860 --> 49:56.900]  I have a document that I will refer to with, uh, that will detail what has happened.
[49:57.040 --> 50:02.120]  And then he just talks about, uh, up until a few days ago, he didn't know this was happening.
[50:02.220 --> 50:06.260]  I never bet on baseball or any other sports or asked somebody to do so on my behalf.
[50:06.260 --> 50:11.360]  I've never gone through a bookmaker to bet on sports, but you can right now with DraftKings.
[50:12.100 --> 50:12.880]  Nuh-uh.
[50:13.540 --> 50:18.420]  In conclusion, Ipe has been stealing money from my account and telling lies.
[50:19.140 --> 50:27.440]  Last weekend in Korea, media reached out to my camp inquiring about my potential involvement in sports betting, which you can do right now with DraftKings.
[50:29.800 --> 50:30.280]  Cyclops.
[50:31.200 --> 50:31.720]  He's the X-Man.
[50:32.020 --> 50:33.060]  We talked about him a second ago.
[50:33.120 --> 50:33.960]  The Beast.
[50:35.060 --> 50:36.580]  It's, uh, Kelsey Grammer.
[50:36.720 --> 50:37.800]  That's Kelsey Grammer.
[50:37.980 --> 50:39.840]  Rogue. Can't touch her, don't kiss her.
[50:40.040 --> 50:40.880]  That's, uh, that's...
[50:40.880 --> 50:43.660]  She'll steal your memories and your essence. If she doesn't want to, she'll just do it.
[50:43.740 --> 50:45.640]  That's Sookie Stackhouse from, what's that actress's name?
[50:46.340 --> 50:50.140]  Uh, oh, Sookie Stackhouse? Uh, yeah, uh...
[50:50.140 --> 50:50.680]  Anna Paquin.
[50:50.700 --> 50:51.400]  Anna, Anna Paquin.
[50:52.040 --> 50:52.740]  What a pull.
[50:52.740 --> 50:53.220]  Anna Paquin.
[50:53.260 --> 50:53.940]  What a pull!
[50:54.780 --> 51:00.620]  She was like the, she was like the original, uh, what's that fucking lady from the Twilight?
[51:01.800 --> 51:02.200]  Vampire.
[51:03.040 --> 51:04.320]  No, the human lady.
[51:04.580 --> 51:04.840]  Bella.
[51:05.220 --> 51:06.060]  Bella, yeah.
[51:06.200 --> 51:08.160]  What's her, Kristen Stewart? She's like the original Kristen Stewart.
[51:08.460 --> 51:10.360]  She was in love with a vampire and a werewolf.
[51:11.700 --> 51:13.960]  Joe Manganiello from Deal or No Deal Island.
[51:14.000 --> 51:15.040]  Oh, that show's so good.
[51:15.360 --> 51:16.060]  He played Al C.
[51:16.120 --> 51:23.460]  And then she had Eric Northman, who was the guy who beat his wife in that movie with, uh, or that TV show on HBO.
[51:23.780 --> 51:24.100]  Yep.
[51:25.300 --> 51:26.140]  Alexander Skarsgård.
[51:26.360 --> 51:28.380]  Wasn't there a guy who could turn into a dog on that show?
[51:29.460 --> 51:30.500]  I mean, there's werewolves.
[51:30.820 --> 51:32.720]  Right, but there was a guy who could, like, turn into a dog.
[51:33.340 --> 51:33.900]  Warpath, probably.
[51:34.160 --> 51:34.440]  Storm.
[51:34.560 --> 51:35.800]  I watched every episode of that show.
[51:35.880 --> 51:37.060]  I couldn't tell you one thing about it.
[51:37.120 --> 51:38.320]  I think I saw most of it also.
[51:39.340 --> 51:42.960]  Like, uh, like the cousin, the do-rag and stuff.
[51:43.240 --> 51:43.500]  Yeah.
[51:43.540 --> 51:44.720]  I can't remember his name.
[51:44.760 --> 51:45.820]  The kid who was, uh, the cop?
[51:45.940 --> 51:47.040]  No, the, uh, like...
[51:47.040 --> 51:47.280]  Jason?
[51:47.440 --> 51:48.640]  No, the cousin, like, the chef.
[51:49.100 --> 51:49.380]  Oh.
[51:49.620 --> 51:51.200]  And he would say, like, who even is you?
[51:51.500 --> 51:52.700]  You know, interesting.
[51:53.140 --> 51:55.660]  I don't know anything about the background of that.
[51:55.780 --> 51:57.100]  I guess books or something first.
[51:57.340 --> 52:00.460]  His character was supposed to die in season, like, one.
[52:00.520 --> 52:00.860]  Oh, no.
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.100]  But he was so popular and such a great actor that they kept him alive.
[52:04.220 --> 52:04.360]  Oh.
[52:04.720 --> 52:05.980]  Good work.
[52:06.140 --> 52:06.560]  There you go.
[52:06.820 --> 52:07.900]  This is some National Lampoon shit.
[52:08.080 --> 52:09.240]  These are from old National Lampoons.
[52:09.340 --> 52:11.480]  This is when people used to read magazines to laugh.
[52:11.560 --> 52:11.760]  Yeah.
[52:12.040 --> 52:13.020]  That was a long time ago.
[52:13.120 --> 52:13.780]  That was a long time ago.
[52:14.260 --> 52:14.860]  That's a bear.
[52:15.120 --> 52:16.380]  See, this is like...
[52:16.380 --> 52:16.900]  What?
[52:17.080 --> 52:17.680]  Hang on.
[52:18.280 --> 52:19.400]  That's not what happens.
[52:19.500 --> 52:19.860]  That's not.
[52:20.860 --> 52:22.760]  That's the Bozo the Clown up with the presidents.
[52:23.540 --> 52:24.120]  What the?
[52:24.920 --> 52:25.840]  And then here we go.
[52:27.100 --> 52:27.440]  President...
[52:27.440 --> 52:28.480]  Is that Gerald Ford?
[52:28.620 --> 52:31.840]  No, I think it's supposed to be, like, he's got, like, the thing on his forehead.
[52:31.980 --> 52:32.860]  Like, that's how he got the...
[52:32.860 --> 52:33.660]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:33.680 --> 52:35.660]  The Weinstein kind of looking thing on his forehead.
[52:35.920 --> 52:36.840]  Oh, you think that's Gorbachev?
[52:36.900 --> 52:37.580]  Yeah, I think so.
[52:37.640 --> 52:38.160]  Yeah, maybe.
[52:38.180 --> 52:38.940]  He did ice cream.
[52:39.120 --> 52:40.720]  Here, you want the blind region?
[52:45.620 --> 52:46.300]  Ooh, prism.
[52:46.880 --> 52:47.220]  Ooh.
[52:47.680 --> 52:48.640]  Don't know what that is.
[52:50.800 --> 52:53.360]  1995 NFL prism with an S.
[52:53.580 --> 52:53.720]  What?
[52:55.640 --> 52:57.540]  We'll see what this is all about.
[52:57.700 --> 52:57.940]  Prism.
[52:58.260 --> 52:58.600]  Prism.
[53:02.640 --> 53:04.120]  How much are you going to make off these?
[53:04.500 --> 53:04.900]  Are you going to be a millionaire?
[53:05.180 --> 53:05.600]  Save the company?
[53:05.960 --> 53:06.360]  Dude.
[53:06.720 --> 53:07.740]  Here it comes right here.
[53:07.920 --> 53:08.720]  You're welcome, Rooster Teeth.
[53:10.200 --> 53:11.080]  Priest Holmes.
[53:12.600 --> 53:14.420]  You're welcome, Rooster Teeth.
[53:14.960 --> 53:15.840]  Here's Corey Dillon.
[53:16.240 --> 53:16.940]  That's great.
[53:17.640 --> 53:18.820]  And Chad Brown.
[53:18.900 --> 53:19.300]  There you go.
[53:19.360 --> 53:21.080]  We'll knock those out and then that'll be...
[53:21.080 --> 53:21.400]  Beautiful.
[53:21.400 --> 53:23.400]  If we sell each of these for...
[53:24.760 --> 53:25.940]  Quarter of a million?
[53:26.080 --> 53:27.260]  30 million each.
[53:27.260 --> 53:27.700]  Okay, okay, okay.
[53:27.780 --> 53:28.400]  I think we're probably good.
[53:28.480 --> 53:29.960]  Geoff Ramsey, collect apples.
[53:30.160 --> 53:30.400]  Three.
[53:30.700 --> 53:31.660]  Let's open up a Pokemon.
[53:32.080 --> 53:34.400]  You'll have to tell me if I have a dark...
[53:36.620 --> 53:39.360]  Fisher, if something's good, go insane in there and then we'll know.
[53:40.060 --> 53:41.580]  You start screaming it into Gracie's headset.
[53:42.320 --> 53:42.920]  She's not wearing it.
[53:42.920 --> 53:43.580]  It's a frog.
[53:44.960 --> 53:45.620]  That's a frog?
[53:45.740 --> 53:46.180]  Hang on, wait.
[53:46.400 --> 53:47.920]  Wait, go back to the first one.
[53:48.180 --> 53:48.800]  It's a frog.
[53:49.020 --> 53:49.900]  Oh, I think it's a leek.
[53:50.100 --> 53:50.880]  Okay, that's a gopher.
[53:50.880 --> 53:51.680]  All right, keep it going.
[53:51.780 --> 53:52.540]  It's a sea serpent.
[53:52.680 --> 53:53.800]  Yeah, don't read the names.
[53:53.900 --> 53:54.260]  Just keep going.
[53:55.100 --> 53:55.800]  This is good.
[53:56.300 --> 53:57.260]  This is a...
[53:57.260 --> 53:58.840]  He's a wrassler punch man.
[53:58.920 --> 53:59.040]  Okay.
[53:59.760 --> 54:00.920]  This is a...
[54:00.920 --> 54:01.520]  What do you call those things?
[54:01.580 --> 54:01.880]  Turtles?
[54:01.980 --> 54:02.160]  Yep.
[54:02.280 --> 54:02.660]  Blue turtle.
[54:02.880 --> 54:04.220]  He probably has bad circulation.
[54:04.340 --> 54:04.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.000]  Oh, this is a nightmare.
[54:06.440 --> 54:08.060]  This is a terrible, terrible nightmare.
[54:09.680 --> 54:11.040]  Oh, that's a...
[54:11.040 --> 54:11.980]  One of those...
[54:11.980 --> 54:12.460]  That's normal.
[54:12.860 --> 54:13.560]  That's normal.
[54:14.040 --> 54:14.580]  And then...
[54:14.580 --> 54:16.620]  Oh, here's a mimic barrier ability.
[54:16.940 --> 54:17.880]  Mr. Mime.
[54:18.240 --> 54:18.600]  Wow.
[54:18.660 --> 54:19.060]  That's cool.
[54:19.060 --> 54:19.680]  Is it good?
[54:19.800 --> 54:21.180]  Oh, everybody loves this one.
[54:21.460 --> 54:22.000]  It's a...
[54:23.180 --> 54:23.900]  Foil Charizard.
[54:24.060 --> 54:24.580]  Is it good?
[54:25.000 --> 54:25.500]  Is it good?
[54:25.720 --> 54:26.080]  Okay!
[54:26.440 --> 54:27.120]  Something happened!
[54:27.340 --> 54:29.440]  He gets pictures going insane!
[54:30.960 --> 54:31.640]  Holy shit!
[54:31.660 --> 54:32.180]  Is it good?
[54:34.640 --> 54:37.120]  It's just been floating around in the sack pack this whole time.
[54:37.220 --> 54:37.680]  I'll give you $20.
[54:37.680 --> 54:38.540]  Did we save the company?
[54:38.760 --> 54:40.460]  I'll give you $20 right now to rip it in half.
[54:40.980 --> 54:41.800]  Oh, shit.
[54:42.040 --> 54:43.480]  What do you think a...
[54:43.480 --> 54:44.760]  What is this thing called?
[54:44.860 --> 54:45.520]  Foil Charizard?
[54:45.700 --> 54:46.540]  I can't even look it up.
[54:49.260 --> 54:49.980]  Is that the...
[54:49.980 --> 54:50.240]  Rip it.
[54:50.500 --> 54:50.720]  What?
[54:50.840 --> 54:51.780]  Fisher says rip it.
[54:52.520 --> 54:53.140]  What's it...
[54:53.840 --> 54:54.580]  What's it worth?
[54:56.080 --> 54:57.040]  Well, I don't have a phone.
[54:57.120 --> 54:57.800]  I can't look it up.
[54:58.260 --> 54:59.060]  Is this like a...
[55:00.400 --> 55:01.440]  The chase card?
[55:01.520 --> 55:02.500]  Or just a chase card?
[55:02.620 --> 55:04.760]  Is that the one that Jake Paul had around his neck?
[55:05.000 --> 55:05.540]  That was fake?
[55:06.740 --> 55:07.220]  Oh, wow.
[55:08.420 --> 55:09.140]  Foil Charizard...
[55:09.140 --> 55:10.300]  On ambers?
[55:10.420 --> 55:10.780]  Oh, wow.
[55:11.300 --> 55:12.020]  On ambers...
[55:12.020 --> 55:12.480]  Oh, jeez.
[55:12.740 --> 55:12.920]  Wow.
[55:14.100 --> 55:15.960]  Look, and the chat says rip that shit.
[55:16.780 --> 55:17.720]  I mean, like...
[55:18.080 --> 55:19.040]  That's what that is, right?
[55:21.740 --> 55:22.180]  Uh...
[55:22.180 --> 55:23.300]  I mean, this is...
[55:23.300 --> 55:24.020]  Don't worry about that thing.
[55:24.060 --> 55:24.960]  Geoff Ramsey...
[55:25.420 --> 55:26.340]  Yeah, okay.
[55:26.580 --> 55:27.440]  This is like...
[55:27.440 --> 55:28.160]  This is pretty decent.
[55:28.440 --> 55:29.980]  I'm definitely selling that dumb thing.
[55:30.080 --> 55:30.240]  Yep.
[55:30.840 --> 55:31.280]  Uh...
[55:31.280 --> 55:31.840]  Should we get it graded?
[55:32.520 --> 55:32.960]  Uh...
[55:32.960 --> 55:34.080]  Here's a tangle of...
[55:34.080 --> 55:34.340]  Yeah, get it.
[55:34.820 --> 55:36.660]  This is like a tangle of loose hair.
[55:36.880 --> 55:37.100]  Yeah.
[55:37.960 --> 55:38.400]  Uh...
[55:38.400 --> 55:39.080]  That's a...
[55:39.920 --> 55:40.440]  This is...
[55:40.440 --> 55:41.180]  That looks like COVID.
[55:41.540 --> 55:43.060]  I found a Forbes article that says,
[55:43.120 --> 55:45.000]  how to know if your Charizard Pokemon card is rare,
[55:45.360 --> 55:46.400]  invaluable, or not.
[55:46.600 --> 55:46.860]  Ooh.
[55:46.980 --> 55:47.860]  Not reading this shit.
[55:48.280 --> 55:48.580]  Get real.
[55:48.580 --> 55:49.680]  Oh, here's an Ivysaur.
[55:50.800 --> 55:52.440]  And then here's a Marowak.
[55:53.460 --> 55:54.040]  Is that good, too?
[55:54.040 --> 55:54.960]  Oh, we're happy about that, too?
[55:55.440 --> 55:56.460]  Okay, we gotta save these.
[55:56.580 --> 55:58.200]  Save the Marowak, or the Ivysaur.
[55:58.820 --> 55:59.680]  And then, uh...
[55:59.680 --> 56:00.580]  Let me open up these...
[56:00.580 --> 56:01.440]  Let's open up...
[56:01.440 --> 56:02.840]  We got any more of these in here floating around?
[56:02.840 --> 56:03.920]  Got this mosaic.
[56:04.820 --> 56:07.100]  You think Captain Scarlet is worth anything?
[56:07.520 --> 56:07.880]  Uh...
[56:07.880 --> 56:08.900]  I got a little pile over here.
[56:09.020 --> 56:11.140]  Yeah, let me know if there's more Pokemon cards in there.
[56:11.440 --> 56:12.440]  Darren Waller...
[56:12.440 --> 56:13.440]  Give us the crew something to do.
[56:13.580 --> 56:14.660]  Baker Mayfield Bighead...
[56:16.080 --> 56:16.280]  Uh...
[56:16.280 --> 56:16.920]  Contact parts!
[56:17.480 --> 56:17.660]  Anthony Gibson...
[56:17.660 --> 56:18.180]  They're ugly.
[56:18.240 --> 56:19.380]  What the fuck?
[56:19.980 --> 56:22.220]  Anthony Gibson, and then Man of the Year, Jerome Bettis.
[56:22.340 --> 56:22.580]  Nice.
[56:22.700 --> 56:23.860]  Here's a...
[56:24.300 --> 56:25.720]  1991 2nd Series Top Stadium Club.
[56:25.800 --> 56:26.640]  I don't remember what was in this.
[56:26.700 --> 56:30.020]  Obviously, you want the Griffey rookie, but I don't know if it was Series 1 or 2.
[56:32.620 --> 56:33.420]  So, we'll see.
[56:34.600 --> 56:35.440]  And then this'll be it.
[56:35.500 --> 56:36.060]  Then it'll be over.
[56:36.180 --> 56:38.560]  And then we're all gonna go off camera and fuckin' seppuku.
[56:39.760 --> 56:40.600]  I have stuff to do.
[56:40.780 --> 56:42.420]  I have to go cook Romos, so I'm not gonna do that.
[56:42.480 --> 56:42.900]  We're not gonna do that.
[56:42.920 --> 56:43.740]  You have to cook Romos?
[56:44.860 --> 56:45.260]  I have to cook...
[56:45.260 --> 56:46.300]  I have to cook Romos.
[56:46.300 --> 56:46.940]  Yeah.
[56:47.260 --> 56:47.940]  That's cool.
[56:49.440 --> 56:50.320]  Tony Romo?
[56:50.360 --> 56:50.540]  Yep.
[56:51.440 --> 56:52.340]  I have to cook him.
[56:52.900 --> 56:53.880]  Cook for Tony Romo.
[56:54.560 --> 56:55.560]  There's Glenn Davis.
[56:56.000 --> 56:57.040]  There's Tommy Gregg.
[56:57.180 --> 56:57.620]  These are so...
[56:57.620 --> 56:58.300]  These are 90s...
[56:58.840 --> 56:59.580]  Don Orton.
[57:00.200 --> 57:00.720]  Yeah, they are.
[57:01.500 --> 57:02.380]  Robin Yowt.
[57:02.500 --> 57:02.980]  Loved him.
[57:04.700 --> 57:05.440]  Tim Hewlett.
[57:06.200 --> 57:07.140]  Oh, shit.
[57:07.500 --> 57:08.700]  Geoff Bagwell.
[57:08.780 --> 57:09.180]  Nice.
[57:09.460 --> 57:12.220]  I think that's a bleacher, but it looks kinda like he's leaning up against a...
[57:12.220 --> 57:12.500]  Diving board.
[57:12.500 --> 57:13.420]  A diving board, yeah.
[57:13.420 --> 57:14.180]  That's pretty fuckin' cool.
[57:14.180 --> 57:14.960]  You about to jump in, baby?
[57:14.960 --> 57:15.500]  Bagwell.
[57:15.680 --> 57:16.660]  Luis Gonzalez.
[57:17.540 --> 57:18.420]  Chuck Knobloch.
[57:18.540 --> 57:19.720]  One of the best baseball names.
[57:19.860 --> 57:20.640]  I think that's such a great baseball player.
[57:20.640 --> 57:21.440]  Ed Nunez.
[57:21.500 --> 57:22.120]  Albert Bell.
[57:22.240 --> 57:22.660]  He was great.
[57:22.800 --> 57:23.460]  Mo Vaughn.
[57:23.520 --> 57:24.300]  Also a great player.
[57:25.840 --> 57:27.180]  I like watching...
[57:27.180 --> 57:27.820]  Mo Vaughn on.
[57:28.160 --> 57:29.940]  I like watching Mo Vaughn swing.
[57:30.040 --> 57:32.200]  Like, just hit compilations where it's like...
[57:32.200 --> 57:34.140]  He's just mean to the baseball.
[57:34.400 --> 57:34.860]  It's great.
[57:36.240 --> 57:37.120]  Some AEW.
[57:37.740 --> 57:38.200]  Oh, cool.
[57:38.700 --> 57:39.020]  We'll do...
[57:39.760 --> 57:40.640]  We'll do some...
[57:40.640 --> 57:40.840]  Ow.
[57:41.920 --> 57:43.540]  Got about two minutes left, and then that's it.
[57:43.860 --> 57:44.300]  Forever.
[57:44.300 --> 57:44.840]  That's it forever.
[57:45.120 --> 57:46.880]  You went to a wrestling thing this weekend, huh?
[57:47.260 --> 57:48.340]  I went to two different shows.
[57:48.660 --> 57:51.340]  I had commentary on one on Saturday, and then I went to a show.
[57:51.460 --> 57:52.440]  Some friends were working on Sunday.
[57:52.520 --> 57:52.780]  It was fun.
[57:53.020 --> 57:53.380]  It was a good time.
[57:53.720 --> 57:54.280]  Oh, Twin Peaks.
[57:54.440 --> 57:54.560]  Definitely.
[57:55.100 --> 57:55.740]  Ooh, McDonald's.
[57:55.960 --> 57:57.080]  We only have two minutes!
[57:58.460 --> 57:59.100]  Bryce Rendsburg.
[57:59.480 --> 58:00.260]  That's the referee.
[58:01.280 --> 58:01.920]  Claudio Castagnoli.
[58:02.240 --> 58:03.580]  Claudio Castagnoli, but...
[58:03.580 --> 58:05.280]  Did you see that that guy bit someone on...
[58:05.280 --> 58:05.840]  Yeah, that was...
[58:06.120 --> 58:07.000]  You see, he got a tattoo.
[58:07.300 --> 58:07.700]  They're married.
[58:08.160 --> 58:08.800]  Satnam Singh.
[58:08.860 --> 58:10.800]  Satnam Singh is very tall, very big.
[58:10.960 --> 58:11.120]  Yeah.
[58:11.400 --> 58:12.200]  Oh, there's that dude.
[58:12.700 --> 58:13.020]  MJF.
[58:13.020 --> 58:14.020]  Daniel Garcia.
[58:14.420 --> 58:14.840]  Hell yeah.
[58:15.080 --> 58:15.680]  He's happy.
[58:16.180 --> 58:18.180]  Do you think it's good to put a tattoo over an open mouth wound?
[58:18.180 --> 58:18.880]  You see Gary Smart in a lot.
[58:19.600 --> 58:20.700]  Pento L-Zero.
[58:20.780 --> 58:21.920]  Yeah, you're really locked into that.
[58:22.080 --> 58:22.620]  He's the...
[58:22.620 --> 58:24.240]  George Kittle is, like, a big fan.
[58:24.320 --> 58:26.480]  And when he does the celebration, he does the Cerro Miedo.
[58:26.680 --> 58:27.780]  Like, that's his taunt.
[58:30.240 --> 58:31.060]  Is he, like, denim?
[58:31.800 --> 58:34.120]  No, he's just a Lucha Libre Mexican wrestling fan.
[58:34.160 --> 58:34.200]  Oh, okay.
[58:34.380 --> 58:35.060]  Ooh, basketball.
[58:35.620 --> 58:36.520]  We don't have time!
[58:36.580 --> 58:36.980]  We gotta go!
[58:37.400 --> 58:38.500]  This is the end of Twin Peaks.
[58:38.580 --> 58:39.780]  I could tell you all these moments.
[58:39.820 --> 58:40.320]  They're amazing.
[58:40.460 --> 58:41.540]  But we'll just look at it...
[58:41.540 --> 58:42.600]  Hey, there's, uh...
[58:43.460 --> 58:43.900]  Bobby.
[58:44.860 --> 58:45.580]  No shoes!
[58:45.780 --> 58:46.280]  No shoes!
[58:47.740 --> 58:48.640]  That's, like, the bird.
[58:48.720 --> 58:48.840]  Yeah.
[58:50.100 --> 58:51.440]  Is this the last pack?
[58:51.520 --> 58:52.340]  This is, uh...
[58:52.340 --> 58:53.960]  Yeah, this is the last pack right here.
[58:54.080 --> 58:55.080]  The last one ever, guys.
[58:55.240 --> 58:55.880]  And, yeah.
[58:56.200 --> 58:57.300]  Geoff Ramsey, collect apples.
[58:57.520 --> 58:57.960]  Apples.
[58:58.080 --> 58:58.240]  Three.
[58:58.340 --> 58:58.820]  Dennis Schroeder.
[58:59.480 --> 59:00.360]  Kawhi Leonard.
[59:00.960 --> 59:01.840]  Jalen Johnson.
[59:02.280 --> 59:03.320]  Luke Kinnard.
[59:03.840 --> 59:05.560]  I have so many fucking Luke Kinnard autographs.
[59:06.240 --> 59:06.920]  Now you have even more?
[59:07.620 --> 59:08.500]  Keontae George.
[59:08.720 --> 59:10.160]  Here we got a little Scoot Henderson.
[59:10.160 --> 59:12.480]  And then Jalen Slauson.
[59:12.600 --> 59:19.580]  And our final card of the Fuck Face Break Show is a purple Nicolette...
[59:19.580 --> 59:20.200]  Oh, wow!
[59:20.200 --> 59:21.180]  Joker magic!
[59:22.620 --> 59:23.140]  Parallel...
[59:23.140 --> 59:25.680]  I'm gonna treat it like it's the shiny Charizard.
[59:26.020 --> 59:27.140]  Oh, my God!
[59:28.380 --> 59:33.250]  You want the last pack of cards?
[59:33.330 --> 59:34.710]  We open to be One Direction.
[59:34.890 --> 59:35.230]  What the fuck?
[59:35.290 --> 59:36.670]  This is for Rebecca.
[59:37.510 --> 59:38.710]  Rebecca, we're going out.
[59:39.090 --> 59:39.870]  Gracie's excited.
[59:39.910 --> 59:40.250]  An homage to you.
[59:40.390 --> 59:42.490]  Rebecca and Millie and Gracie.
[59:43.250 --> 59:44.950]  This is what the Break Show is really about.
[59:44.990 --> 59:45.770]  This is what it's really about.
[59:45.770 --> 59:46.650]  We're gonna play this out.
[59:46.670 --> 59:48.090]  Oh, I didn't even get Dallas cards!
[59:48.110 --> 59:49.070]  We love Louis.
[59:50.790 --> 59:53.230]  We love Zayn Malik.
[59:53.310 --> 59:55.990]  We love Niall.
[59:56.570 --> 59:58.030]  We love Liam.
[59:59.270 --> 01:00:01.410]  We definitely love Harry.
[01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:04.150]  We love Louis again.
[01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:07.730]  We live while we're young.
[01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:10.390]  We're gonna keep it forever.
[01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:14.050]  We're super into the Zayn spellbound card.
[01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:16.630]  And then everybody loves...
[01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:17.810]  Back when they were on the road!
[01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:20.790]  And then Zayn!
[01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:22.130]  The one who left the band.
[01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:24.410]  Just like we're leaving your internet.
[01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:25.630]  That's right, we did it.
[01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:27.630]  Go listen to the podcast.
[01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:29.210]  And go to Geoff Ramsey, collect apples.
[01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:30.030]  Apples, three.
[01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:32.010]  Yeah, listen to the podcast and keep an ear out.
[01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:32.930]  Keep an eyeball out.
[01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:34.490]  If you like what we're doing here,
[01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:35.710]  if you ever want to see us do it again,
[01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:37.030]  we probably will.
[01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:38.630]  Where can people see your Daily Rip?
[01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:40.650]  People can look at my Daily Rip,
[01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:42.910]  if they want to, on TikTok.
[01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:45.210]  By going to Geoff's Daily Rip.
[01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:47.930]  And then if you want to go to the Fuckface podcast,
[01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:49.890]  it's... you probably know where it is.
[01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:50.890]  I would think so.
[01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:52.470]  Who knows what's next?
[01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:53.230]  Oh yeah, this...
[01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:54.510]  If anybody wants to buy my One Direction cards...
[01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:55.030]  It's Friday at 10am!
[01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:57.470]  Listen to Clutch My Pearls.
[01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:58.090]  Thank you.
[01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:59.110]  Wide shoes.
[01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:04.670]  God, at least we're done with that one.
