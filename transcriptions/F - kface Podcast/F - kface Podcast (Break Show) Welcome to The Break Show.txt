[00:00.640 --> 00:04.100]  Did we go live? And we did it!
[00:04.400 --> 00:09.220]  Hello and welcome to the first episode of the Face Break Show.
[00:09.460 --> 00:13.760]  You may be thinking to yourself, but Geoff, we've seen this show a couple dozen times
[00:13.760 --> 00:14.580]  before you did.
[00:14.680 --> 00:16.140]  You saw previous iterations of it.
[00:16.180 --> 00:17.340]  You saw our dry runs.
[00:17.580 --> 00:18.700]  You saw the practices.
[00:19.100 --> 00:20.560]  You saw the preseason.
[00:21.120 --> 00:23.160]  You saw the summer league version.
[00:23.380 --> 00:26.800]  But you haven't seen Major League Break Show.
[00:26.800 --> 00:33.900]  It starts today, episode one of 150,000 episodes we'll be doing.
[00:34.060 --> 00:37.200]  We're going to go weekly for the next 150,000 weeks.
[00:37.980 --> 00:38.140]  Nope.
[00:38.300 --> 00:42.980]  I want to be really clear about, if we're off on a Monday, I'm not coming in and we're
[00:42.980 --> 00:43.880]  not pre-recording it.
[00:43.980 --> 00:45.100]  So it's live Monday.
[00:45.580 --> 00:46.380]  Most Mondays.
[00:46.600 --> 00:47.220]  Most Mondays.
[00:47.400 --> 00:51.300]  But for the next 150,000 Mondays, you have a really good shot of seeing this live.
[00:51.320 --> 00:51.680]  You do.
[00:51.860 --> 00:52.880]  You have a good shot.
[00:53.420 --> 00:54.900]  Statistically, very good shot.
[00:55.140 --> 00:55.840]  Unless we're out of town.
[00:55.840 --> 00:56.740]  Unless we're out of town.
[00:56.980 --> 00:58.560]  Or it's like Christmas time.
[00:58.860 --> 00:59.180]  Yeah.
[00:59.380 --> 00:59.820]  We're not going to...
[00:59.820 --> 01:00.960]  There's no reason to pre-record this.
[01:01.080 --> 01:01.740]  No, no, no.
[01:01.740 --> 01:02.600]  This is a...
[01:02.600 --> 01:02.760]  Yeah.
[01:03.000 --> 01:03.480]  Watch it!
[01:03.740 --> 01:05.400]  It's a great show for most Mondays.
[01:05.420 --> 01:05.680]  Yeah.
[01:05.760 --> 01:08.840]  Also, also, if you...
[01:08.840 --> 01:12.180]  I guess this doesn't pertain to you if you're watching this live right now, but you can
[01:12.180 --> 01:12.840]  let your friends know.
[01:13.280 --> 01:18.160]  This will be recorded and put out later on Rooster Teeth for First members on Thursday
[01:18.160 --> 01:19.820]  and then live on the...
[01:19.820 --> 01:20.120]  Hit the button.
[01:20.180 --> 01:20.280]  Ready?
[01:21.480 --> 01:24.320]  Face YouTube channel on Fridays for everyone.
[01:24.320 --> 01:25.220]  So that's...
[01:25.220 --> 01:26.600]  Thursday, Friday is when it'll come out.
[01:26.700 --> 01:28.420]  But Monday, live, 4 p.m.
[01:28.420 --> 01:29.140]  That's when we're doing it.
[01:29.540 --> 01:34.500]  Now, we just correctly used the F button twice in a row.
[01:34.580 --> 01:35.800]  Do you think that's a record for us?
[01:36.440 --> 01:36.860]  Yes.
[01:37.580 --> 01:39.260]  We should have a sign that says, like, days.
[01:40.680 --> 01:42.000]  Days since missed F-bomb.
[01:42.700 --> 01:43.900]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:44.620 --> 01:49.460]  I guess I am your host, co-host, Erika Baudour, and then other co-hosts.
[01:49.700 --> 01:51.580]  And she's on the ones and zeros.
[01:51.960 --> 01:52.620]  Emily Hatfield.
[01:52.620 --> 01:54.320]  On the... more the ones and twos.
[01:54.960 --> 01:55.500]  There you go.
[01:56.480 --> 01:58.120]  The number ones and the number twos.
[01:58.180 --> 01:58.380]  Yeah.
[01:58.620 --> 02:00.460]  Emily had quite a fart session last night.
[02:00.540 --> 02:01.480]  Oh my God, I did not.
[02:03.700 --> 02:06.240]  She didn't, but she does love when I say stuff like that.
[02:06.660 --> 02:07.620]  What are we doing?
[02:07.880 --> 02:12.780]  All right, so we're going to be opening up cards in very similar fashion to what we've
[02:12.780 --> 02:13.080]  done before.
[02:13.140 --> 02:14.420]  We're going to be opening up sports cards.
[02:14.540 --> 02:15.220]  We got basketball.
[02:15.420 --> 02:16.200]  That's my favorite sport.
[02:16.280 --> 02:16.440]  Yeah.
[02:16.520 --> 02:16.860]  Of course.
[02:17.500 --> 02:18.180]  That's new stuff.
[02:18.200 --> 02:19.260]  We're going to open up old stuff.
[02:19.300 --> 02:19.480]  Okay.
[02:19.480 --> 02:20.260]  Like old baseball.
[02:20.400 --> 02:21.380]  But we're not just doing that.
[02:21.480 --> 02:23.940]  We're also opening up country classics.
[02:24.360 --> 02:26.940]  We're opening up Star Wars.
[02:26.960 --> 02:27.780]  You've seen Star Wars?
[02:27.980 --> 02:28.300]  I have.
[02:28.480 --> 02:29.260]  Huge franchise.
[02:29.560 --> 02:29.780]  Big one.
[02:29.960 --> 02:31.340]  A lot of people into the Star Wars.
[02:31.460 --> 02:32.320]  They have cards now, too.
[02:32.380 --> 02:35.180]  Never knew that Luke Skywalker did a handstand with Yoda on his foot.
[02:35.320 --> 02:37.040]  Yeah, she was like, well, yeah, what the hell is that?
[02:37.080 --> 02:38.780]  And I was like, it's the Digimon system.
[02:38.860 --> 02:40.780]  Do you remember when people weren't really into Star Wars?
[02:41.060 --> 02:42.740]  Like it went away for like a long time?
[02:42.760 --> 02:43.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:43.680 --> 02:44.900]  And then like it came back?
[02:44.920 --> 02:46.260]  It came back with a vengeance.
[02:47.200 --> 02:51.400]  Did George Lucas remake it in the 90s so that way his like wife at the time didn't get
[02:51.400 --> 02:52.180]  any more money from it?
[02:52.320 --> 02:52.780]  Is that what happened?
[02:53.700 --> 02:54.900]  That's the rumor that I heard.
[02:55.120 --> 02:57.580]  According to rumors that I'm starting on this show, that's what happened.
[02:57.620 --> 03:01.520]  It's like the Lucas version, like how Taylor Swift is like, uh-huh, this is not the Taylor
[03:01.520 --> 03:01.920]  version.
[03:02.760 --> 03:03.680]  He re-recorded all...
[03:03.680 --> 03:03.880]  Yeah.
[03:04.140 --> 03:05.180]  We should probably open some cards.
[03:05.320 --> 03:06.360]  Yeah, so we're going to get started.
[03:06.660 --> 03:10.740]  As we do every episode, when I remember, we're going to start with the pack sack.
[03:10.920 --> 03:11.200]  Sack pack.
[03:11.720 --> 03:12.940]  Pack sack is what it's called.
[03:13.040 --> 03:13.920]  Sack pack is what it says.
[03:14.360 --> 03:18.220]  You put your hand in, you randomly pull out a pack of cards, and that's what you get from
[03:18.220 --> 03:18.540]  the pack sack.
[03:18.660 --> 03:23.940]  Oh, we're going Garbage Pail Kid's Chrome is what we got for Inaugural Pull.
[03:24.100 --> 03:25.000]  I hate these cards.
[03:25.340 --> 03:26.420]  These are disgusting.
[03:26.780 --> 03:27.500]  Crappy Mike Trout card.
[03:27.520 --> 03:28.080]  Isn't the point?
[03:28.460 --> 03:29.000]  To be yucky?
[03:29.620 --> 03:31.020]  Yes, and that's why I don't like...
[03:31.020 --> 03:31.760]  Eric's not a yucky boy.
[03:31.780 --> 03:32.540]  I'm not a yucky guy.
[03:33.040 --> 03:33.920]  He's a fastidious, unclean boy.
[03:33.920 --> 03:34.900]  I don't like being sticky.
[03:35.140 --> 03:35.900]  I don't like yucking.
[03:36.140 --> 03:36.860]  Well, yeah.
[03:37.080 --> 03:37.780]  All right, let's see what we got.
[03:37.800 --> 03:39.780]  He's not a bloated Blair fan.
[03:39.900 --> 03:40.220]  Oh.
[03:40.540 --> 03:41.440]  It's like a butt.
[03:41.540 --> 03:43.180]  Yeah, she's got a butt and a nose on her butt.
[03:43.800 --> 03:45.400]  Oh, here we have...
[03:45.400 --> 03:46.680]  This is a...
[03:48.360 --> 03:49.120]  Trophy Trey.
[03:49.940 --> 03:50.480]  That's not gross.
[03:50.500 --> 03:51.300]  He's exploding.
[03:51.840 --> 03:52.640]  No, that's not bad at all.
[03:52.800 --> 03:53.180]  He's...
[03:53.180 --> 03:55.680]  I don't understand why that would be in Garbage Pail Kid's.
[03:56.400 --> 03:57.240]  Here's a horny...
[03:57.240 --> 03:58.800]  Here's a thirst trap turned on Tara.
[03:59.000 --> 03:59.480]  Oh, man.
[03:59.580 --> 03:59.860]  Get it?
[04:00.040 --> 04:00.360]  Yeah.
[04:00.720 --> 04:01.880]  And then...
[04:01.880 --> 04:02.720]  These suck.
[04:03.580 --> 04:03.920]  These suck.
[04:03.920 --> 04:05.020]  Here's our prism.
[04:05.860 --> 04:07.340]  Numbered to one hundred...
[04:07.340 --> 04:08.340]  Two hundred and ten.
[04:08.440 --> 04:09.340]  Why is that so hard to see?
[04:10.180 --> 04:11.140]  Oh, upside down.
[04:11.160 --> 04:11.480]  That's why.
[04:11.620 --> 04:12.580]  Numbered to one hundred and fifty.
[04:13.020 --> 04:15.060]  Here we have our...
[04:16.240 --> 04:17.440]  Checkerboard prism parallel.
[04:17.560 --> 04:19.220]  They call them a refractor when it's a Topps card.
[04:19.420 --> 04:20.240]  Baked Jake.
[04:20.460 --> 04:21.900]  He's baked from the sun.
[04:22.300 --> 04:25.040]  He's not baked like muffins or weed.
[04:25.460 --> 04:25.960]  There you go.
[04:26.220 --> 04:26.440]  Go ahead and...
[04:26.440 --> 04:27.100]  Okay.
[04:27.360 --> 04:30.420]  Didn't see anything for our overall collection, but we'll sleeve that one, right?
[04:30.560 --> 04:32.000]  So, should that go in...
[04:32.000 --> 04:32.100]  No.
[04:32.600 --> 04:33.640]  Now, we'll just sleeve it.
[04:33.640 --> 04:33.840]  No.
[04:34.380 --> 04:36.360]  Honestly, that should go in the trash.
[04:36.740 --> 04:37.160]  But...
[04:37.160 --> 04:38.440]  Maybe it's like an Eric folder?
[04:38.460 --> 04:38.880]  No.
[04:39.960 --> 04:40.380]  Garbage.
[04:40.560 --> 04:40.700]  Okay.
[04:40.920 --> 04:41.180]  Garbage.
[04:41.300 --> 04:42.340]  Oh, it's a Garbage Pail.
[04:42.480 --> 04:42.560]  Garbage Pail.
[04:42.560 --> 04:47.100]  Next we're going to do, in homage, we're going to open up a pack of 1989 Topps Baseball.
[04:47.220 --> 04:47.440]  Why?
[04:47.800 --> 04:49.520]  Because Don Zimmer lives in these packs.
[04:49.820 --> 04:51.960]  If you aren't familiar with the show, we are chasing a Zim.
[04:52.100 --> 04:54.100]  That means we are trying to get a Don Zimmer card.
[04:54.220 --> 04:54.860]  We've got many.
[04:55.160 --> 04:56.720]  The holy grail is always a Zim.
[04:56.740 --> 04:56.860]  We want more.
[04:57.100 --> 04:58.140]  There's no such thing as enough.
[04:58.280 --> 04:58.460]  Nope.
[04:59.160 --> 04:59.700]  It's like a...
[04:59.700 --> 05:00.360]  It's like a...
[05:00.360 --> 05:02.640]  It's like an Elon Musk or a...
[05:02.640 --> 05:04.160]  What's the one that owns Facebook?
[05:04.920 --> 05:05.640]  Mark Zuckerberg?
[05:05.840 --> 05:05.960]  Uh-huh.
[05:06.100 --> 05:06.460]  Or...
[05:06.460 --> 05:07.220]  Money's never...
[05:07.220 --> 05:07.880]  There's never enough money.
[05:07.940 --> 05:08.840]  There's never enough Don Zimmer.
[05:08.840 --> 05:09.440]  Ooh, give me money!
[05:09.540 --> 05:09.880]  Ooh!
[05:09.880 --> 05:10.740]  Ooh, I need more!
[05:12.020 --> 05:12.760]  Rich yet.
[05:13.480 --> 05:14.220]  Are we rich yet?
[05:14.340 --> 05:16.480]  That's the first thing he said when he signed his major league contract.
[05:17.480 --> 05:19.380]  How about name as a pun?
[05:20.380 --> 05:21.560]  Name as a pun is good.
[05:22.180 --> 05:22.480]  Or a question.
[05:22.860 --> 05:23.060]  Okay.
[05:23.580 --> 05:24.320]  I will...
[05:24.320 --> 05:26.100]  I'm going to make a label for name as a pun.
[05:26.480 --> 05:27.380]  Tom Brookins.
[05:28.360 --> 05:28.760]  Uh...
[05:28.760 --> 05:29.420]  I got nothing.
[05:30.700 --> 05:31.500]  Israel Sanchez.
[05:31.800 --> 05:32.880]  I was thinking it'd be fun...
[05:32.880 --> 05:33.680]  That's like a...
[05:33.680 --> 05:34.340]  Mustache?
[05:34.420 --> 05:34.880]  It's a good mustache?
[05:35.180 --> 05:35.460]  It's a good mustache.
[05:35.460 --> 05:36.260]  It's a good Dirty Sanchez.
[05:36.960 --> 05:37.280]  Oh!
[05:37.400 --> 05:38.520]  Israel Dirty Sanchez.
[05:38.520 --> 05:39.660]  How about we...
[05:39.660 --> 05:41.300]  We give them names...
[05:41.300 --> 05:41.600]  Nicknames.
[05:41.800 --> 05:43.300]  That's not even a thing!
[05:44.940 --> 05:45.740]  Larry McWilliams.
[05:46.000 --> 05:46.600]  Willie McGee.
[05:47.920 --> 05:48.720]  Jose Uribe.
[05:48.900 --> 05:49.520]  Oh, Tony Phillips.
[05:49.740 --> 05:50.140]  Flipped.
[05:50.300 --> 05:50.940]  I thought he was an autograph.
[05:50.980 --> 05:55.260]  Emily, here's our first label that we can put on...
[05:55.260 --> 05:56.340]  This is what Gracie found.
[05:56.660 --> 05:57.400]  Our giant...
[05:58.180 --> 05:59.580]  Now, I shall use it to...
[05:59.580 --> 05:59.920]  Pedo Brian.
[06:00.160 --> 06:00.480]  Let's see.
[06:00.540 --> 06:01.520]  This is pun name.
[06:01.580 --> 06:02.620]  Should that go over...
[06:02.620 --> 06:03.740]  It should go at the very front.
[06:03.920 --> 06:05.260]  No, it should just go at the very front.
[06:05.280 --> 06:07.160]  Automobile Records is now pun name.
[06:07.280 --> 06:07.480]  Okay.
[06:08.380 --> 06:09.400]  Storm Davis.
[06:09.640 --> 06:10.540]  That's a good name.
[06:10.760 --> 06:11.560]  Should we do a...
[06:11.940 --> 06:13.160]  That's like a porn name.
[06:13.300 --> 06:14.060]  Like Stormy Daniels.
[06:14.160 --> 06:14.360]  Stormy...
[06:14.360 --> 06:14.980]  Storm Davis.
[06:15.300 --> 06:17.240]  It's like related to porn by first name.
[06:18.300 --> 06:20.740]  Should we do a weather effects team?
[06:23.220 --> 06:24.180]  Storm and Gale.
[06:24.440 --> 06:25.700]  It's not even Gale.
[06:27.560 --> 06:28.100]  Is there any...
[06:28.100 --> 06:29.600]  Are there any baseball players named Cumulus?
[06:31.860 --> 06:33.200]  It's Kyle Nimbus.
[06:33.860 --> 06:34.640]  Chet Lemon.
[06:35.160 --> 06:36.100]  Name is a food!
[06:36.200 --> 06:37.060]  Name is a food!
[06:38.420 --> 06:39.300]  There you go.
[06:39.320 --> 06:41.260]  I'm still trying to get this sticker going.
[06:41.500 --> 06:42.240]  How do I...
[06:42.240 --> 06:43.140]  Well, you know, we can do it later.
[06:43.580 --> 06:43.900]  Thanks.
[06:44.160 --> 06:45.060]  We might have to do it in a second.
[06:45.120 --> 06:50.680]  Okay, so I want people to know that food name is what I'm really, really excited about.
[06:50.680 --> 06:51.100]  I am too.
[06:51.200 --> 06:52.440]  I want to feel the whole team.
[06:52.540 --> 06:52.980]  Of food.
[06:53.000 --> 06:53.220]  Food.
[06:53.300 --> 06:54.380]  Yeah, we're going to build out a dinner.
[06:54.640 --> 06:55.300]  That's a functional...
[06:55.300 --> 06:56.480]  We're going to build out a dinner.
[06:56.500 --> 06:57.380]  That's a functional team.
[06:57.460 --> 06:58.040]  All right, here's food name.
[06:58.080 --> 07:00.340]  Floyd Bannister and then Bill Picotta.
[07:00.800 --> 07:00.920]  Okay.
[07:00.980 --> 07:01.440]  That's food?
[07:01.580 --> 07:02.300]  Food is Picotta.
[07:02.420 --> 07:03.240]  Oh, that's not spelled like that.
[07:03.480 --> 07:04.060]  Chicken Picotta.
[07:06.600 --> 07:07.380]  You know what, though?
[07:07.420 --> 07:07.960]  Let's throw them in there.
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.320]  We can always take them out if we find better food.
[07:10.100 --> 07:12.420]  Okay, moving right along, I want to do something else kind of fun.
[07:12.640 --> 07:12.680]  Okay.
[07:12.760 --> 07:16.620]  This is a pack of, I believe, Tops 85 baseball cards.
[07:16.760 --> 07:18.140]  I bought this recently for $15.
[07:18.740 --> 07:19.180]  So it's $0.59?
[07:19.520 --> 07:20.640]  Yeah, that's not what I paid for.
[07:20.680 --> 07:20.960]  Oh, right.
[07:20.960 --> 07:21.280]  Inflation.
[07:22.000 --> 07:22.320]  Inflation.
[07:23.200 --> 07:26.920]  Because these have a very sought after...
[07:26.920 --> 07:28.500]  I already have the card, but I've never pulled it.
[07:28.540 --> 07:28.920]  I bought it.
[07:29.120 --> 07:30.160]  Mark McGuire Olympic card.
[07:30.320 --> 07:31.840]  It was like his big rookie when it came out.
[07:31.840 --> 07:32.160]  Oh, really?
[07:32.320 --> 07:33.620]  Yeah, his Olympic team card.
[07:33.620 --> 07:34.780]  These cards look ugly.
[07:34.880 --> 07:35.940]  Yeah, they're great.
[07:36.940 --> 07:37.820]  Jim Essien.
[07:38.060 --> 07:38.500]  Okay.
[07:38.820 --> 07:39.840]  Terry Kennedy.
[07:39.840 --> 07:41.460]  You might remember him from the Padres.
[07:41.640 --> 07:41.860]  Mm-hmm.
[07:42.120 --> 07:43.180]  George Brett.
[07:43.260 --> 07:45.920]  You might remember him from being very angry one day.
[07:45.960 --> 07:46.200]  Yeah.
[07:46.400 --> 07:47.080]  Rick Cerone.
[07:47.340 --> 07:48.940]  Very angry one day.
[07:49.080 --> 07:53.500]  Oh, I don't know what to do about Ken Forrest, but I feel like it's like a face that looks
[07:53.500 --> 07:56.200]  like a... like a mannequin.
[07:56.520 --> 07:57.360]  Not a mannequin.
[07:57.480 --> 07:58.700]  Like a ventriloquist doll.
[07:59.060 --> 08:01.340]  He's got like a ventriloquist doll's face.
[08:01.480 --> 08:03.000]  Is that even a collection we can make?
[08:03.000 --> 08:04.240]  He just has...
[08:04.240 --> 08:04.600]  Doll face?
[08:04.860 --> 08:05.740]  Not a real human.
[08:05.840 --> 08:06.760]  Not a real human.
[08:07.160 --> 08:07.560]  Inhuman?
[08:07.800 --> 08:08.180]  Inhuman.
[08:08.420 --> 08:08.620]  There you go.
[08:09.220 --> 08:10.760]  Oh, Larry Herndon.
[08:11.700 --> 08:12.100]  Ooh.
[08:13.660 --> 08:16.220]  This might be the least coolest picture of a dude I've ever seen.
[08:16.220 --> 08:16.840]  Oh, I'm excited.
[08:17.100 --> 08:17.900]  Ron Davis.
[08:19.520 --> 08:20.620]  Oh, he's just sort of...
[08:20.660 --> 08:22.000]  Yeah, that's not a good look for Ron.
[08:22.060 --> 08:22.280]  No.
[08:22.480 --> 08:23.000]  Maybe it is.
[08:23.020 --> 08:23.500]  That's the problem.
[08:23.520 --> 08:24.240]  Yeah, that might be.
[08:25.240 --> 08:26.040]  Tom Pasierek.
[08:26.200 --> 08:26.380]  Yep.
[08:27.560 --> 08:28.360]  Tom Bernanski.
[08:28.660 --> 08:28.960]  Emily.
[08:30.180 --> 08:30.980]  Ron Say.
[08:31.380 --> 08:32.140]  How are you doing?
[08:32.140 --> 08:32.440]  Hey.
[08:32.520 --> 08:33.240]  It's good to see you.
[08:33.240 --> 08:33.580]  Pretty good.
[08:34.540 --> 08:36.700]  Jose Deleon in the Old School Pirates.
[08:36.940 --> 08:37.720]  Love the hat.
[08:38.020 --> 08:39.860]  Very off-center Doug Corbett.
[08:39.940 --> 08:40.920]  That's not getting a 10.
[08:42.140 --> 08:43.100]  Tom Foley.
[08:44.580 --> 08:45.540]  Bob Brinley.
[08:47.720 --> 08:49.880]  These are guys in an era...
[08:49.880 --> 08:50.080]  Oh, dumb.
[08:50.240 --> 08:52.640]  In an era of baseball that like nobody remembers.
[08:52.900 --> 08:53.580]  Winning pitch.
[08:54.100 --> 08:54.800]  Tommy Dunbar.
[08:54.960 --> 08:56.200]  Yeah, the early to mid 80s.
[08:56.260 --> 08:57.620]  That was kind of a dead period.
[08:57.980 --> 08:59.060]  Frank Viola.
[09:00.420 --> 09:01.020]  Is that an instrument?
[09:01.020 --> 09:02.720]  He used to be on a musical instruments team.
[09:02.860 --> 09:03.120]  Yes.
[09:05.280 --> 09:05.720]  Instruments.
[09:05.720 --> 09:06.740]  Coming for your Larry guitar.
[09:06.740 --> 09:08.240]  Because then you can make a whole band.
[09:08.500 --> 09:09.020]  That's true.
[09:09.300 --> 09:10.180]  In White House.
[09:11.600 --> 09:12.480]  Tom Hume.
[09:12.740 --> 09:14.040]  Jesus Christ.
[09:14.620 --> 09:14.900]  What?
[09:15.220 --> 09:16.900]  Can we do a give me your lunch money?
[09:17.000 --> 09:18.540]  Wow, look at this dork.
[09:18.840 --> 09:19.640]  Good Lord.
[09:19.940 --> 09:20.760]  Do you like Dork Squad?
[09:21.920 --> 09:22.860]  I feel like...
[09:22.860 --> 09:25.040]  Tom, I pre-cut my underwear Hume.
[09:26.400 --> 09:27.280]  Albert Hall.
[09:27.440 --> 09:28.080]  Isn't that a place?
[09:28.300 --> 09:29.200]  Real Albert Hall?
[09:29.240 --> 09:29.660]  Yes, it is.
[09:29.660 --> 09:30.540]  Name is a place.
[09:32.380 --> 09:33.140]  Bruce Bachty.
[09:33.760 --> 09:34.640]  Or Bachty, I can't remember.
[09:35.340 --> 09:36.100]  Tom Tellman.
[09:38.500 --> 09:39.260]  Sid Bream.
[09:39.520 --> 09:40.400]  Showing way too...
[09:40.400 --> 09:41.080]  That's too much T.
[09:42.400 --> 09:44.540]  He doesn't look like a baseball player.
[09:44.780 --> 09:46.920]  He looks like a guy who wandered onto the field.
[09:47.260 --> 09:48.040]  How did I get here?
[09:49.120 --> 09:49.720]  There we go.
[09:49.760 --> 09:50.820]  This is for team How Did I Get Here?
[09:51.300 --> 09:52.660]  I know.
[09:52.760 --> 09:54.120]  See, this is with too many collections.
[09:54.420 --> 09:55.540]  This is what happens when you...
[09:55.540 --> 09:55.800]  It slows down.
[09:55.800 --> 09:57.140]  And a lot of them won't continue.
[09:57.300 --> 09:59.740]  Some will be bangers and some won't.
[10:00.000 --> 10:01.640]  Joe Morgan, there'll never be a second one.
[10:01.720 --> 10:02.500]  Here's a manager card.
[10:02.620 --> 10:03.820]  It's Bob Holmes.
[10:04.420 --> 10:05.960]  Jackie Moore, the other manager's card.
[10:06.260 --> 10:07.360]  Mario Soto.
[10:10.500 --> 10:11.300]  Sean Dunstan.
[10:11.740 --> 10:13.360]  1982, number one draft pick.
[10:13.440 --> 10:15.000]  I wonder if that's Sean Dunstan's rookie card.
[10:15.840 --> 10:16.420]  Will you sleeve that?
[10:16.660 --> 10:18.480]  And then Willie Wilson.
[10:19.440 --> 10:19.600]  Okay.
[10:21.020 --> 10:21.500]  That was fun.
[10:22.580 --> 10:25.200]  We have more cards, but we also have...
[10:27.980 --> 10:29.520]  This is a waffle iron.
[10:29.920 --> 10:30.320]  Waffle maker.
[10:30.520 --> 10:34.140]  We made an actual waffle maker.
[10:34.380 --> 10:35.480]  This is on sale right now.
[10:36.360 --> 10:37.700]  I figured I'd let you know.
[10:39.280 --> 10:40.080]  It says...
[10:40.080 --> 10:40.520]  You hit the button?
[10:41.160 --> 10:42.700]  Face when you make the waffle.
[10:43.600 --> 10:44.860]  My wife really likes it.
[10:44.980 --> 10:45.860]  She likes tiny waffles.
[10:46.420 --> 10:49.080]  We had a pretty in-depth discussion.
[10:49.320 --> 10:53.000]  I don't know if it was on camera about what the best letters to eat are.
[10:53.560 --> 10:54.540]  I think it was the middle, right?
[10:54.560 --> 10:55.780]  We were texting about it.
[10:55.780 --> 10:56.960]  It was the stars.
[10:57.100 --> 11:00.800]  If you just made a waffle out of stars, it would be the best.
[11:00.900 --> 11:03.120]  It captures the syrup the right way.
[11:03.300 --> 11:03.840]  It's a little thinner.
[11:04.120 --> 11:04.500]  It's nice.
[11:04.720 --> 11:05.900]  You should make a star waffle.
[11:06.520 --> 11:07.480]  Check these out.
[11:07.580 --> 11:09.280]  These are on sale right now.
[11:09.440 --> 11:10.540]  I really recommend it.
[11:10.640 --> 11:14.220]  I've used it probably three or four times already.
[11:14.460 --> 11:14.660]  Really?
[11:15.640 --> 11:17.060]  My wife likes waffles.
[11:17.100 --> 11:18.480]  Waffles are a Sunday thing for us.
[11:18.580 --> 11:21.760]  My wife will make them at 930 at night when she just gets up and goes,
[11:21.760 --> 11:22.620]  I'm going to make waffles.
[11:22.880 --> 11:23.880]  And it's like, oh, okay.
[11:25.180 --> 11:25.840]  That's cool.
[11:26.660 --> 11:27.860]  What a life you live.
[11:28.020 --> 11:28.660]  It's really something.
[11:29.320 --> 11:29.920]  9pm waffles.
[11:30.400 --> 11:33.140]  We should get into some mail because we have a lot of mail.
[11:34.540 --> 11:35.640]  We have mail.
[11:35.700 --> 11:37.000]  If you want to send us stuff, you can.
[11:37.180 --> 11:38.380]  You can send it to...
[11:38.380 --> 11:38.800]  Hit the button.
[11:40.200 --> 11:47.440]  Face Break Show, Care of Eric Bedour, 1901 East 51st Street, Austin, Texas, 78723.
[11:48.400 --> 11:49.700]  You can send us stuff.
[11:49.940 --> 11:50.840]  It'll get to us.
[11:51.760 --> 11:52.600]  We have a lot.
[11:52.720 --> 11:54.020]  There's already a lot that we have.
[11:54.100 --> 11:55.640]  We've been sitting on and we're going to open.
[11:56.700 --> 11:58.920]  But I think...
[11:58.920 --> 11:59.780]  If we were just...
[11:59.780 --> 12:01.140]  Give me some of the mail we got.
[12:01.920 --> 12:03.020]  We just got this today.
[12:03.160 --> 12:06.040]  This is from, I think, John and Erica.
[12:06.780 --> 12:10.900]  And they sent some stuff in of like old cards that they had.
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.840]  But like some of these decent.
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.500]  Like should show a couple of these.
[12:14.820 --> 12:18.340]  Erica and John say that they've been regulation listeners since day one.
[12:19.200 --> 12:20.100]  No, you haven't.
[12:20.780 --> 12:21.740]  You are...
[12:21.760 --> 12:23.420]  You are absolutely a comment leader.
[12:23.940 --> 12:25.040]  And we love you for it.
[12:25.840 --> 12:27.060]  You're a mail sender.
[12:27.220 --> 12:30.640]  They sent John's personal collection, including this solid gold Babe Ruth card.
[12:30.840 --> 12:33.080]  So right after this, I'm going to drive up.
[12:33.120 --> 12:33.900]  I'm going to sell this.
[12:34.020 --> 12:35.140]  I'm going to buy a private plane.
[12:35.620 --> 12:38.220]  You guys will cover the rest of the episodes.
[12:38.700 --> 12:40.600]  So we'll add this into the collection.
[12:40.840 --> 12:41.540]  Thank you so much.
[12:41.620 --> 12:43.680]  But we also have this from...
[12:45.240 --> 12:51.000]  Richard from Australia sent us so many packs.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.160]  And I think what we have to do...
[12:53.160 --> 12:53.960]  Let me know what you think of this.
[12:54.180 --> 12:59.880]  I think what we have to do is take some of these and pack sack them.
[13:00.220 --> 13:01.060]  Yeah, we have to.
[13:01.200 --> 13:04.200]  And I think when you guys send stuff in, we might open a couple.
[13:04.420 --> 13:05.600]  We might pack sack the rest.
[13:05.720 --> 13:10.280]  And then as we get through more pack sack stuff, we're going to grab Gremlins 2.
[13:10.400 --> 13:12.120]  And you're like, I sent you Gremlins 2, baby.
[13:12.520 --> 13:13.920]  So here we go. I'm going to show you what we got.
[13:14.060 --> 13:14.660]  We got Gremlins 2.
[13:15.520 --> 13:16.700]  I don't think we've ever opened Gremlins 2.
[13:16.760 --> 13:18.540]  We've definitely opened Toxic High School before.
[13:19.300 --> 13:20.820]  90 NHL Pro Series.
[13:20.860 --> 13:22.560]  We've definitely opened Superstars.
[13:23.320 --> 13:24.620]  We have an idea for that one too.
[13:24.780 --> 13:27.440]  Robot Carnival Masters of Japanese Animation.
[13:27.580 --> 13:28.180]  That sounds cool.
[13:29.600 --> 13:31.520]  The Cut-Ups Project.
[13:31.880 --> 13:32.940]  That's kind of scary.
[13:33.820 --> 13:35.440]  Ooh, Elvis Series 2.
[13:36.380 --> 13:37.360]  Donruss Ace Ventura.
[13:37.520 --> 13:38.600]  I want to open that right now.
[13:38.700 --> 13:40.400]  Maybe we should hold it for a Gavin episode.
[13:40.900 --> 13:43.820]  Open it and then we'll pack sack...
[13:43.820 --> 13:44.340]  What else you got?
[13:44.500 --> 13:46.840]  I'm not done because I have...
[13:49.180 --> 13:50.860]  NBL Series 1, 1995.
[13:52.180 --> 13:52.640]  What is that?
[13:53.140 --> 13:54.280]  It's a basketball.
[13:55.940 --> 13:56.840]  It's a basketball.
[13:57.040 --> 14:00.000]  It's the Futura NBL Basketball League.
[14:00.520 --> 14:01.500]  Is that an Australian league?
[14:01.720 --> 14:02.280]  It must be.
[14:02.520 --> 14:04.400]  These cards are from Richard in Australia.
[14:04.520 --> 14:06.020]  Universal Monsters Illustrated.
[14:08.200 --> 14:09.280]  Let's pack sack them.
[14:09.960 --> 14:11.160]  You got me saying it like you now.
[14:11.300 --> 14:12.360]  The way it's written? Yeah.
[14:13.140 --> 14:14.420]  That's not how you say it though.
[14:14.420 --> 14:15.380]  I agree.
[14:15.980 --> 14:18.420]  I'm excited.
[14:18.760 --> 14:20.420]  I think it's the one you recognize?
[14:20.740 --> 14:25.800]  Yeah, we can look for the Andrew Gay's Sam McKinnon Redemption card.
[14:26.160 --> 14:29.420]  I'm going to bet that we can't redeem that card.
[14:29.940 --> 14:30.500]  Oh, yeah.
[14:30.860 --> 14:32.460]  After 25 years.
[14:34.020 --> 14:35.160]  Alright, let's see.
[14:36.400 --> 14:38.300]  Oh, everybody remembers...
[14:38.940 --> 14:40.220]  Doug Peacock.
[14:41.080 --> 14:44.400]  He was on the Rillers or Drillers or Brillers.
[14:44.420 --> 14:45.380]  I can't tell what that is.
[14:45.460 --> 14:47.000]  Are we doing animal names?
[14:47.100 --> 14:47.920]  We need an animal name.
[14:48.020 --> 14:49.820]  Oh, we can build a zoo.
[14:51.800 --> 14:53.000]  You guys are smart.
[14:54.420 --> 14:55.140]  Chuck Harmison.
[14:58.260 --> 14:58.980]  Butch Hayes.
[14:59.380 --> 15:00.700]  I wonder if we can do a Butch team.
[15:00.880 --> 15:02.060]  I want to do a Jesus team.
[15:02.880 --> 15:04.380]  Maybe doing Butch is too much.
[15:04.540 --> 15:05.300]  I want to do a Jesus team.
[15:07.140 --> 15:07.860]  Scott Ninnis.
[15:09.160 --> 15:09.880]  Cecil Exum.
[15:10.260 --> 15:13.500]  I'm going to go out on a limb right now and say that dude is related to
[15:14.420 --> 15:17.720]  either brother or sister or uncle or father of Dante Exum,
[15:17.900 --> 15:19.820]  who is an NBA player from Australia.
[15:20.140 --> 15:20.260]  Definitely.
[15:20.480 --> 15:22.960]  I bet that's a lineage type thing.
[15:24.180 --> 15:24.700]  I bet you're right.
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.220]  I bet that's his dad or his older brother.
[15:27.300 --> 15:29.160]  Oh, Andrew Gays!
[15:29.500 --> 15:32.080]  Wait, is this the card that they send to them?
[15:32.500 --> 15:33.960]  No, but it's the guy.
[15:36.160 --> 15:37.200]  Greg Hubbard.
[15:38.600 --> 15:42.360]  Do you remember in 95 when Lucas Aggrams was tearing up?
[15:42.360 --> 15:47.180]  You put Lucas Aggrams down in the post for the...
[15:47.180 --> 15:48.660]  What's his team? Sons or something?
[15:48.840 --> 15:50.060]  It's like Pacers and Sons.
[15:51.940 --> 15:52.880]  Oh, Powers?
[15:53.120 --> 15:53.620]  The Powers.
[15:53.980 --> 15:54.760]  Power Sons.
[15:56.820 --> 15:58.480]  Pacers and the Sons.
[15:58.800 --> 16:00.240]  That's such a cool idea.
[16:00.720 --> 16:03.560]  If you're from a different country, just take two logos, mash them together.
[16:03.760 --> 16:04.620]  That's so cool.
[16:04.980 --> 16:05.820]  We're the Yankee Dodgers.
[16:08.420 --> 16:09.600]  We're the Met Sox.
[16:11.180 --> 16:13.020]  Here's Clutchman, Derek Rucker.
[16:13.280 --> 16:15.100]  I wonder if he's related to Darius Rucker.
[16:15.900 --> 16:17.220]  The guy from Hootie and the Blowfish?
[16:17.440 --> 16:17.600]  Probably.
[16:18.820 --> 16:19.580]  Ace Ventura?
[16:20.600 --> 16:21.640]  That's a rumor I'm starting.
[16:22.200 --> 16:23.920]  See, that's what the show's for.
[16:24.940 --> 16:25.380]  Innuendo.
[16:26.560 --> 16:29.400]  Alright, here we go. Let's see what's up with Ace Ventura.
[16:30.460 --> 16:31.660]  I already love it.
[16:32.120 --> 16:35.640]  By the way, this looks like Ace Ventura 2, When Nature Calls, which was a dogshit film.
[16:35.940 --> 16:38.580]  Ace Ventura 1 was phenomenal, but I do like that image.
[16:39.800 --> 16:41.000]  That's a card.
[16:41.220 --> 16:44.400]  We should get that blown up as a poster and give it to Gavin.
[16:44.740 --> 16:48.160]  He jacks off to Ace Ventura.
[16:48.280 --> 16:49.200]  Oh my god.
[16:53.160 --> 16:54.880]  That was a sticker.
[16:55.400 --> 16:56.840]  That was a thing all the time.
[16:57.380 --> 17:00.160]  Here's a picture of a monkey.
[17:01.440 --> 17:02.360]  It's his friend.
[17:03.040 --> 17:04.660]  His friend is the monkey.
[17:04.980 --> 17:06.780]  Here's a picture of...
[17:06.780 --> 17:07.460]  There you go.
[17:07.920 --> 17:09.340]  Jim Carrey with acne.
[17:09.480 --> 17:12.340]  He was acting like he was a fan to get an autograph of someone, right?
[17:12.440 --> 17:13.820]  I think you're right.
[17:14.220 --> 17:16.080]  You gotta remember all those details from this one.
[17:16.660 --> 17:18.980]  Oh, here they are hanging out. Him and the monkey.
[17:19.000 --> 17:20.040]  Him and the monkey. They're friends.
[17:20.160 --> 17:21.540]  Screw my mouth, daddy. Fuck.
[17:22.960 --> 17:26.260]  Gavin can tell us every stupid scene from the movie, which is not very good.
[17:27.360 --> 17:28.780]  He's reacting to a thing.
[17:30.980 --> 17:32.340]  Here he is...
[17:34.920 --> 17:36.540]  He's in the jungle. It's When Nature Called.
[17:37.380 --> 17:39.200]  And there we have some mushrooms.
[17:39.680 --> 17:40.460]  Oh, yeah.
[17:40.720 --> 17:42.800]  There you go. That's about what I expected.
[17:43.100 --> 17:45.700]  I'm realizing now this is not a memorable movie.
[17:46.300 --> 17:50.060]  Ace Ventura 2, When Nature Calls, felt like a parody of the first one.
[17:50.640 --> 17:55.220]  It was a real disappointment to those of us who really, really, really, really liked the first one
[17:55.220 --> 17:56.980]  and were old enough to understand what we were watching.
[17:58.980 --> 18:01.100]  Unlike Gavin, who just saw more Ace Ventura.
[18:01.320 --> 18:04.020]  Of course I like this. It's the guy from the other thing I like.
[18:04.420 --> 18:05.080]  That's great.
[18:05.080 --> 18:06.460]  This is Movie Monsters.
[18:06.640 --> 18:08.200]  We got Bride of Frankenstein.
[18:08.620 --> 18:10.920]  You remember her? She was married to Frankenstein.
[18:10.980 --> 18:11.860]  I think it's Frankenstein.
[18:13.800 --> 18:14.240]  Dracula.
[18:15.160 --> 18:16.200]  You remember that, dude.
[18:16.360 --> 18:19.140]  Have you seen the trailer for the new Dracula movie where he's on a boat?
[18:19.340 --> 18:21.420]  Yeah, The Voyage of the Demeter or whatever.
[18:22.460 --> 18:25.060]  I think it's supposed to be scary. I think it looks funny.
[18:25.160 --> 18:26.040]  Is that the Nicolas Cage one?
[18:26.440 --> 18:28.580]  No, that was Renfield.
[18:28.840 --> 18:33.500]  This is like a boat and then all of these sailors are attacked by a Dracula.
[18:33.500 --> 18:36.280]  Dracula had to get to the New World somehow.
[18:36.440 --> 18:38.300]  Yeah, and apparently it was on a boat.
[18:38.440 --> 18:39.580]  The Incredible Shrinking Man.
[18:39.860 --> 18:43.520]  That was also the case in the Stephen King book.
[18:44.380 --> 18:44.580]  It?
[18:44.960 --> 18:46.300]  No, Salem's Lot.
[18:46.680 --> 18:48.340]  The Incredible Shrinking Man.
[18:49.200 --> 18:50.640]  The cat's gonna eat him.
[18:52.600 --> 18:54.340]  Here's the silent earth.
[18:54.620 --> 18:55.980]  Is he a movie monster?
[18:57.020 --> 18:57.600]  Shrinking Man?
[18:57.600 --> 19:02.820]  I guess. But the monsters became spiders and cats because he was tiny.
[19:03.420 --> 19:06.680]  And then we have the silent earth.
[19:06.900 --> 19:08.160]  And then, oh, here we go.
[19:08.400 --> 19:10.680]  Here's more Bride of Frankenstein. She's heavily featured in these.
[19:10.900 --> 19:12.700]  That's cool art from...
[19:12.700 --> 19:13.920]  Oh, is that Mike Mignola?
[19:14.980 --> 19:15.800]  You want me to sleeve it?
[19:16.100 --> 19:18.320]  Nah, that's art by Mike Mignola though.
[19:18.400 --> 19:20.040]  He did the art for Hellboy.
[19:22.920 --> 19:24.000]  What else do we got?
[19:24.100 --> 19:24.920]  Let's do just Star Wars.
[19:25.880 --> 19:27.120]  People like Star Wars.
[19:28.000 --> 19:28.380]  Is that you?
[19:29.720 --> 19:30.120]  Yes.
[19:31.620 --> 19:31.660]  Cool.
[19:34.400 --> 19:35.960]  I don't ever open Star Wars stuff.
[19:36.480 --> 19:36.780]  Oh, yeah?
[19:36.960 --> 19:37.900]  Yeah, but people seem...
[19:37.900 --> 19:39.040]  People are into it.
[19:39.880 --> 19:40.580]  People like Star Wars.
[19:40.680 --> 19:43.820]  This is where I find out Star Wars changed and I don't know it as well as I used to.
[19:43.820 --> 19:44.420]  I understand, yeah.
[19:44.700 --> 19:46.760]  Vel Sartha. I remember her from...
[19:46.760 --> 19:47.740]  Don't remember her.
[19:47.900 --> 19:49.680]  Star Wars sucks.
[19:50.320 --> 19:50.720]  Kyrgyzstan.
[19:53.380 --> 19:54.180]  Quinlan Vos.
[19:54.440 --> 19:55.260]  Here's one I know.
[19:56.160 --> 19:56.960]  Darth Maul.
[19:57.780 --> 19:58.180]  Great.
[19:58.180 --> 19:59.160]  No, that dude.
[20:01.920 --> 20:02.960]  Here's 8D8.
[20:03.500 --> 20:04.020]  Chrome.
[20:04.380 --> 20:05.220]  None of these are good.
[20:05.300 --> 20:05.460]  Refractor.
[20:06.000 --> 20:12.320]  We got an Obi-Wan and Anakin cover art card.
[20:12.440 --> 20:12.620]  Great.
[20:12.960 --> 20:14.240]  And then, here we go, die cut.
[20:16.020 --> 20:17.360]  Oh, is that cool?
[20:17.540 --> 20:18.220]  It's Kit Fisto.
[20:18.560 --> 20:20.720]  Kit Fisto shouldn't be a name.
[20:20.960 --> 20:21.940]  Let's do...
[20:21.940 --> 20:26.500]  Do we have a team of names that sound like porn things?
[20:27.360 --> 20:29.340]  That's what you're trying to get us to make?
[20:29.540 --> 20:32.500]  I mean, he looks like he's a glow stick and he's out.
[20:35.480 --> 20:40.480]  It's like he's dressed up like it and he's out with his glow stick trick-or-treating, like not wanting to get hit by a car.
[20:40.680 --> 20:41.600]  You wanna save this?
[20:41.920 --> 20:43.540]  Yeah, I wanna sleeve it because it's probably worth something.
[20:43.960 --> 20:46.180]  So should we have a folder of probably worth something?
[20:46.820 --> 20:48.200]  And then eventually...
[20:48.200 --> 20:50.520]  The ones that I'm like, just sleeve because they're valuable.
[20:50.720 --> 20:51.820]  I'll have that over here.
[20:52.000 --> 20:52.980]  Here's the Desert Storm cards.
[20:52.980 --> 20:55.760]  Oh, hey, Fisher brought these in for us.
[20:55.800 --> 20:57.000]  He's our technical director.
[20:58.160 --> 20:59.500]  He's on the ones and twos.
[20:59.620 --> 21:01.080]  He's hitting cameras, moving them around.
[21:01.320 --> 21:03.980]  Well, not moving them around, but showing you which cameras they are.
[21:04.300 --> 21:05.940]  So he said his dad has all of these.
[21:06.180 --> 21:07.940]  What should our chase card be for this Desert Storm?
[21:08.200 --> 21:08.980]  Oh, Saddam.
[21:09.460 --> 21:11.880]  Saddam or I'm gonna get Norman Schwarzkopf.
[21:12.100 --> 21:13.480]  Oh, Schwarzkopf's a good one.
[21:14.340 --> 21:16.700]  So we got a SH-60B helicopter.
[21:16.720 --> 21:17.560]  You ever pilot that?
[21:17.860 --> 21:19.440]  No, I don't think I've ever been on one of those.
[21:20.180 --> 21:21.320]  Heat Storm in the Gulf.
[21:21.320 --> 21:21.980]  You've been there?
[21:22.440 --> 21:26.060]  Yeah, and currently Texas is about as hot as it was.
[21:27.720 --> 21:28.860]  Oh, shit, we got close.
[21:28.980 --> 21:31.440]  We got Chief of Staff General Charles Gabriel.
[21:32.640 --> 21:33.520]  Was that your boss?
[21:33.800 --> 21:35.340]  I was out before...
[21:36.280 --> 21:37.500]  He was out before I was in, I think.
[21:38.200 --> 21:38.920]  SCUD missile.
[21:39.160 --> 21:39.840]  You seen one of those?
[21:41.300 --> 21:42.320]  Not in... maybe.
[21:43.640 --> 21:44.840]  F-15 fighter plane.
[21:44.880 --> 21:46.100]  I have never been in one, Eric.
[21:46.280 --> 21:49.120]  But I have shot them from the air.
[21:49.820 --> 21:51.040]  From the air or from the ground?
[21:51.420 --> 21:53.380]  That means that I went up one time in a C-130,
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.940]  and they practiced a refueling exercise with F-15s,
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.240]  and so they would drop the cable out,
[21:58.320 --> 22:00.240]  and then the F-15 would come up, and then refuel,
[22:00.440 --> 22:02.400]  and then break off, and I shot that whole thing.
[22:02.580 --> 22:03.980]  So I've been in the air with a F-15.
[22:03.980 --> 22:06.280]  I just want you to know that when you say,
[22:06.400 --> 22:09.640]  I shot this thing, what it means...
[22:09.640 --> 22:10.360]  Is photography.
[22:10.640 --> 22:12.320]  I was an Army photographer.
[22:12.860 --> 22:14.620]  Yes, no, I understand that.
[22:14.840 --> 22:16.480]  I just want you to know that when you said,
[22:16.560 --> 22:19.600]  I shot this from the ground, it was so like...
[22:19.600 --> 22:21.000]  Like nonchalant, like...
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.080]  Like I'm a terrorist.
[22:22.580 --> 22:23.940]  It's like, what are you talking about?
[22:24.000 --> 22:24.780]  I spent some time in the East.
[22:25.440 --> 22:25.760]  You photographed it.
[22:26.180 --> 22:27.600]  You know, don't look too deeply into it.
[22:27.680 --> 22:29.460]  Moving in, that's what we did.
[22:29.720 --> 22:30.940]  We decided, that's our oil.
[22:33.040 --> 22:34.220]  F-111 bombers.
[22:34.440 --> 22:34.840]  You seen those?
[22:36.500 --> 22:37.180]  That's what they do.
[22:37.200 --> 22:38.400]  I need a bomb noise.
[22:38.720 --> 22:39.140]  You don't.
[22:39.480 --> 22:42.140]  That was pretty close.
[22:42.300 --> 22:42.980]  It bounces.
[22:43.400 --> 22:44.900]  This dude is ready in the cockpit.
[22:51.460 --> 22:52.100]  Field artillery.
[22:52.220 --> 22:54.280]  I'm not familiar with their crest, but it's gorgeous.
[22:54.500 --> 22:55.500]  What did your crest look like?
[22:55.780 --> 22:56.300]  Not like that.
[22:56.360 --> 22:57.360]  Was yours the one with the horse?
[22:57.540 --> 22:58.220]  Yeah, I had a horse crest.
[22:58.240 --> 22:58.940]  You had a horse crest?
[23:00.080 --> 23:01.060]  Largest patch in the Army.
[23:01.460 --> 23:01.780]  What?
[23:01.960 --> 23:03.180]  I was a point of pride with them.
[23:03.480 --> 23:05.300]  The biggest patch in the Army, 1st Cavalry Division.
[23:05.840 --> 23:06.080]  Oh.
[23:06.200 --> 23:08.380]  Their patch was bigger, and they wanted you to know it.
[23:08.460 --> 23:08.860]  That's cool.
[23:10.160 --> 23:11.020]  Big ol' horse.
[23:21.320 --> 23:22.680]  Typically, they're owned by Topps.
[23:23.000 --> 23:27.280]  They make the best baseball product, but they get into unlicensed basketball.
[23:27.760 --> 23:29.840]  But because of the NIL, they can do college and stuff.
[23:30.340 --> 23:32.720]  Oh, to make money off these kids who don't make money off themselves?
[23:32.720 --> 23:33.680]  I think these kids make money.
[23:33.800 --> 23:36.440]  Jalen Cook.
[23:36.920 --> 23:38.100]  He flexin'.
[23:38.620 --> 23:39.340]  Kajani Wright.
[23:40.620 --> 23:41.280]  He skyscrapers.
[23:41.280 --> 23:42.600]  Would Cook be part of our food?
[23:42.780 --> 23:43.440]  We need a chef.
[23:43.520 --> 23:45.120]  Everybody needs a chef.
[23:45.660 --> 23:47.080]  Do you know what you eat for dessert?
[23:47.540 --> 23:48.000]  What's that?
[23:48.420 --> 23:48.920]  Judah Mints.
[23:49.980 --> 23:50.600]  Hey, alright.
[23:51.180 --> 23:52.940]  This is a pretty good pack.
[23:54.900 --> 23:55.220]  Zachary.
[23:55.660 --> 23:56.740]  And then we'll go ahead and...
[23:56.740 --> 23:57.780]  We're gonna save this one?
[23:57.840 --> 23:59.580]  I don't know if this is worth anything, but we'll go ahead and save it anyway.
[23:59.840 --> 24:02.300]  I mean, didn't even really get a look at it, so that's pretty exciting.
[24:03.780 --> 24:04.420]  Thank you.
[24:05.100 --> 24:05.420]  Skyscraping.
[24:05.600 --> 24:06.040]  Okay, thank you.
[24:06.820 --> 24:08.780]  Alright, now we'll go on to Topps Chrome.
[24:08.980 --> 24:12.880]  Everybody is excited about 2023 Topps Chrome.
[24:12.920 --> 24:14.360]  Trying to get an Adley Rushman chaser?
[24:18.700 --> 24:20.420]  There's a lot of hot rookies this year.
[24:20.700 --> 24:22.400]  Josh Jung, I think he's pretty popular.
[24:23.360 --> 24:23.860]  Here we go.
[24:23.920 --> 24:24.660]  Chris Bryant.
[24:26.200 --> 24:28.800]  But apparently there's just really good hits in Chrome this year.
[24:29.260 --> 24:30.480]  So people have been having a lot of luck.
[24:30.560 --> 24:31.400]  Jordan Alvarez.
[24:32.220 --> 24:32.760]  Fucking cheaters.
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.360]  He's even on the team, that's the best.
[24:35.800 --> 24:37.100]  Cal Raleigh, he plays for cheaters.
[24:37.520 --> 24:38.180]  Oh, here we go.
[24:38.240 --> 24:42.240]  We got a throwback Austin Riley silver refractor.
[24:42.400 --> 24:45.180]  So we'll leave that out just because it's worse.
[24:45.460 --> 24:46.540]  Yeah, why not?
[24:46.540 --> 24:47.000]  These are trash.
[24:47.080 --> 24:48.380]  I like the brave, but we won't hold it against them.
[24:48.460 --> 24:49.200]  Treasure chest.
[24:50.380 --> 24:51.220]  That was it?
[24:51.660 --> 24:52.780]  That was all that was in that.
[24:53.080 --> 24:53.900]  Like three of them.
[24:56.120 --> 24:57.620]  Here's what, this took me a while to get.
[24:58.240 --> 24:59.800]  Prism Monopoly NBA.
[25:00.280 --> 25:00.820]  Ultra rare.
[25:03.280 --> 25:05.860]  NBA Prism X Monopoly crossover.
[25:06.520 --> 25:09.680]  It's basically Panini Prism cards.
[25:10.840 --> 25:15.240]  The regular Panini Prism cards, but with a Monopoly logo on it.
[25:15.240 --> 25:17.840]  And they have a thousand parallels.
[25:18.140 --> 25:18.460]  Oh, okay.
[25:18.600 --> 25:20.260]  You also can only get it from Target.
[25:20.800 --> 25:23.920]  It's retail only, and they're only available at Target.
[25:24.340 --> 25:26.140]  And so it's a real nightmare to get.
[25:26.280 --> 25:26.980]  How many are in that box?
[25:27.460 --> 25:29.100]  This is their version of a blaster.
[25:29.420 --> 25:31.500]  So it's four cards per pack, six packs per box.
[25:31.860 --> 25:32.260]  Jesus.
[25:32.560 --> 25:33.660]  So that's about 25 bucks.
[25:33.960 --> 25:34.780]  Damn, that's crazy.
[25:36.140 --> 25:37.800]  These are hard, hard, hard to get.
[25:37.820 --> 25:39.580]  I've only opened one other box, one other of those.
[25:40.880 --> 25:41.940]  Let's see, let's see what we get.
[25:42.380 --> 25:44.240]  Obviously, I'm looking for Marcus Smarts.
[25:45.240 --> 25:46.260]  How do you feel about the NBA season coming up?
[25:47.360 --> 25:53.420]  You know, I feel not great about losing Marcus Smart, but it's going to be...
[25:54.800 --> 25:55.260]  optimistic.
[25:56.980 --> 26:01.000]  SGA, probably the best point guard in the NBA at this point, or will be very soon.
[26:03.280 --> 26:05.580]  MPJ, we're not going to say anybody's names, KG.
[26:05.840 --> 26:06.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[26:07.460 --> 26:09.240]  No, MPJ and SGA are new names.
[26:09.320 --> 26:10.220]  Michael Porter Jr.
[26:10.440 --> 26:13.220]  Jeremy Grant, and then Miles Turner.
[26:13.920 --> 26:14.960]  Really off-center.
[26:15.240 --> 26:16.580]  None of these are parallels.
[26:17.980 --> 26:23.560]  The rub on these Monopoly cards, in addition to being hard to get, is that they are real stingy with the hits.
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.100]  Real fucking stingy.
[26:25.180 --> 26:27.120]  The other box I bought was...
[26:27.940 --> 26:28.420]  Oof.
[26:28.940 --> 26:31.700]  DeMar DeRozan, I'm surprised he's still a bull.
[26:32.800 --> 26:33.280]  Giannis.
[26:33.500 --> 26:33.780]  Okay.
[26:35.180 --> 26:36.080]  Jason Tatum.
[26:36.360 --> 26:38.340]  Got about 50 of these.
[26:38.820 --> 26:39.300]  Great.
[26:40.120 --> 26:42.980]  Brandon Ingram, still no hits, still no parallels.
[26:42.980 --> 26:46.440]  That's fine. Not this one, but the next one is going to have stuff.
[26:46.620 --> 26:47.240]  Christ, dude.
[26:47.880 --> 26:52.940]  When you guys went to Summer Lake, did you only see rookies, or did some people that have cards play at all?
[26:53.320 --> 26:56.520]  No, we saw people who have cards on the sidelines.
[26:56.620 --> 26:57.960]  Yeah, we saw a few people. We saw Cole Anthony.
[26:58.980 --> 27:00.880]  Saw some people in cool outfits, just kind of like chilling.
[27:01.300 --> 27:07.300]  Yeah, but by the time we were there, the day we watched games, it was also the WNBA All-Star Game.
[27:07.420 --> 27:10.740]  And I think most of the NBA players were probably headed over there for that.
[27:10.880 --> 27:12.060]  Here we go. LeBron.
[27:12.520 --> 27:17.940]  Now, this is the... I guess they just call it the alternate card.
[27:19.280 --> 27:21.860]  It's a slightly rarer version of the normal.
[27:22.660 --> 27:27.200]  I don't know if it's an SP necessarily, but it's just like a different picture.
[27:27.620 --> 27:32.880]  Paul George, Keegan Murray, base rookie, and Jalen Duren, base rookie.
[27:32.980 --> 27:34.280]  Well, at least we got two base rookies.
[27:34.380 --> 27:35.820]  I told you, man. I told you it's on this one.
[27:36.240 --> 27:37.040]  I told you it's the next one.
[27:38.000 --> 27:38.920]  It's this one right here.
[27:40.080 --> 27:40.800]  Watch this. Boom.
[27:40.800 --> 27:43.760]  Sam Adebayo, DeJounte Murray.
[27:43.980 --> 27:45.900]  We lost a room problem that DeJounte Murray, they say.
[27:46.240 --> 27:48.600]  Rudy Gobert, just a real human problem, that guy, they say.
[27:49.260 --> 27:49.980]  Steph Curry.
[27:51.500 --> 27:54.520]  Oh, I was... I meant this one.
[27:54.680 --> 27:56.520]  Still searching for a hit. Still looking for a hit.
[27:56.660 --> 27:57.980]  I think I know what we need to do.
[27:59.480 --> 28:05.480]  Scotty Barnes, Russell Westbrook, the Unicorn, Christos Porzingis, the newest Boston Celtic.
[28:06.040 --> 28:07.840]  Triple J, Jaron Jackson Jr.
[28:08.640 --> 28:09.900]  Still no hit. Here's what we're going to do.
[28:09.900 --> 28:11.660]  We're going to take our last pack.
[28:11.760 --> 28:14.840]  And we're going to use Don Zimmer.
[28:15.280 --> 28:16.180]  We're going to rub a little...
[28:17.120 --> 28:19.940]  We're going to rub a little Zimmer. We're going to give us a little Zimmer mojo.
[28:20.160 --> 28:21.100]  Last pack mojo.
[28:22.100 --> 28:23.120]  Blessed by Zimmer.
[28:24.800 --> 28:25.520]  This will be the one.
[28:29.920 --> 28:30.880]  RJ Barrett.
[28:30.980 --> 28:31.260]  Okay.
[28:31.960 --> 28:32.580]  Jaden Hardy.
[28:34.400 --> 28:36.220]  DeAndre Ayton and Jabari Smith.
[28:36.220 --> 28:40.940]  Not a single fucking parallel in that entire...
[28:40.940 --> 28:42.100]  Like, that is criminal.
[28:43.220 --> 28:44.440]  What a lump of shit.
[28:44.580 --> 28:50.720]  I really wish that I could recommend these Monopoly prism cards to y'all, but they're fucking dog shit.
[28:50.740 --> 28:51.400]  Yeah, sorry, bud.
[28:51.500 --> 28:52.160]  That sucks.
[28:52.200 --> 28:54.080]  Oh, someone said put curry in the food.
[28:56.620 --> 28:57.180]  That's good.
[29:02.370 --> 29:03.470]  I'm so sorry.
[29:03.910 --> 29:05.210]  No, that's fine. That's great.
[29:05.350 --> 29:06.390]  Thank you. At least we got something.
[29:07.350 --> 29:09.090]  Curry's the best food I ate when I was in Japan.
[29:09.530 --> 29:11.390]  And London. So good.
[29:12.290 --> 29:14.290]  Alright, let's do this. Let's open up Superstars.
[29:15.230 --> 29:17.750]  These are always hits for us. We got some fun stuff we're going to do in the future.
[29:17.870 --> 29:19.130]  We're going to build playlists out of these.
[29:19.270 --> 29:20.930]  Yeah, we got to do that soon, I think.
[29:20.970 --> 29:21.950]  Speaking of playlists.
[29:22.170 --> 29:25.270]  Oh, dude. We have some supplemental content for the...
[29:25.270 --> 29:25.610]  Hit the button.
[29:27.930 --> 29:29.910]  Summer of 98 that we have coming.
[29:30.030 --> 29:34.190]  We have some really, really cool supplemental content that we filmed on Friday.
[29:34.630 --> 29:37.670]  And it was just a banger. It was so much fun.
[29:37.670 --> 29:40.710]  What was your favorite band in the 80s?
[29:41.530 --> 29:41.930]  Eric?
[29:42.190 --> 29:44.310]  Well, I mean, I was born in 86.
[29:45.050 --> 29:46.370]  So you got four years there.
[29:46.570 --> 29:48.210]  Okay. Talking Heads.
[29:48.370 --> 29:49.010]  Okay. Emily?
[29:50.430 --> 29:50.830]  Poison.
[29:51.530 --> 29:54.190]  That's a good one, too. A lot of people would have said Dad.
[29:54.550 --> 29:55.810]  Nobody would have said Dad.
[29:56.270 --> 29:57.270]  Also, what the fuck?
[29:57.570 --> 29:59.010]  That is not Sebastian Bach.
[29:59.590 --> 30:02.390]  Dude, that might be Sebastian Bach. That might be a young Sebastian Bach.
[30:02.390 --> 30:04.630]  Why would you name your band Dad?
[30:04.630 --> 30:08.010]  Originally known as Disneyland After Dark.
[30:08.470 --> 30:10.430]  Dude, these guys suck.
[30:10.930 --> 30:12.430]  Oh, my God.
[30:12.910 --> 30:15.570]  It's a quartet of hard-rocking musicians from Copenhagen.
[30:15.690 --> 30:16.590]  So it's definitely not Sebastian Bach.
[30:16.930 --> 30:19.850]  They recorded their first record in 85, a three-track, 12-inch single,
[30:19.950 --> 30:21.290]  Standing on the Never Never.
[30:21.990 --> 30:25.090]  Certainly their signature tune, Marlboro Man.
[30:25.510 --> 30:29.090]  They've released three albums, Call of the Wild, Dad Draws a Circle,
[30:29.310 --> 30:31.730]  and No Fuel Left for the Pilgrim.
[30:31.730 --> 30:33.190]  Dad Draws a Circle?
[30:33.190 --> 30:34.830]  Dad Draws a Circle.
[30:35.790 --> 30:38.550]  Lenny Kravitz, who I feel like is maybe a vampire or a highlander,
[30:38.910 --> 30:40.470]  because he's been around for...
[30:40.470 --> 30:45.530]  I'm pretty sure he's been a successful working musician since 1930s.
[30:45.830 --> 30:47.310]  And he hasn't aged a day.
[30:48.010 --> 30:49.830]  Oh, there's Chrissy Hynde and the Pretenders.
[30:49.970 --> 30:50.510]  That's pretty cool.
[30:51.610 --> 30:52.370]  Kiss Army.
[30:53.990 --> 30:55.210]  I don't know what ever happened to her.
[30:55.970 --> 30:57.330]  Do you remember in the 80s for a little while,
[30:57.430 --> 30:59.830]  she was popular for a little while, and then she just kind of disappeared.
[31:00.370 --> 31:00.750]  Madonna.
[31:02.030 --> 31:04.890]  George Michael, I hear the documentary on Wham! is very good.
[31:05.330 --> 31:05.770]  Netflix.
[31:06.850 --> 31:07.730]  Cheap Trick.
[31:08.390 --> 31:10.610]  You got Bunny Carlos there? Hell yeah.
[31:10.870 --> 31:12.110]  Ooh, we got a historic concert.
[31:12.530 --> 31:15.610]  Were any of you at the Fillmore when Geofferson Airplane played?
[31:15.690 --> 31:17.950]  I wasn't. I just missed it.
[31:20.410 --> 31:22.390]  Gone Too Soon. He was born in 86.
[31:22.670 --> 31:23.150]  But what day?
[31:23.670 --> 31:24.410]  May 10th?
[31:24.570 --> 31:26.230]  This was right before you were born.
[31:26.310 --> 31:27.210]  May 3rd or 4th.
[31:27.210 --> 31:27.930]  1968.
[31:29.090 --> 31:34.750]  Yeah, I was almost born a few years later.
[31:34.750 --> 31:35.770]  You gotta mix the numbers up in your head.
[31:35.790 --> 31:38.710]  If you start scrambling the numbers, this all makes sense.
[31:40.090 --> 31:42.250]  Anyway, Gone Too Soon, taken before his time.
[31:42.690 --> 31:43.270]  Bismarck Key.
[31:44.370 --> 31:47.150]  A lot of people don't know this. Before he was a musician, scientist.
[31:48.250 --> 31:49.730]  Working science. That's him in the lab.
[31:49.950 --> 31:51.350]  I think he would have been an Oppenheimer.
[31:52.390 --> 31:52.950]  But here we are.
[31:53.050 --> 31:55.170]  If he'd lived. Yeah, that's a shame.
[31:55.170 --> 31:57.890]  We got some discounts for you to use 10 cents off.
[31:58.030 --> 32:00.050]  Here's an instant win game. Let's see if we win.
[32:00.170 --> 32:03.010]  I think the worst part of Oppenheimer is when they called him Oppy.
[32:03.250 --> 32:04.710]  It just made me feel... I didn't like it.
[32:06.790 --> 32:09.030]  Sorry. Try again. Still not winning.
[32:09.450 --> 32:13.050]  And then last but not least, to the extreme, Vanilla Ice.
[32:14.090 --> 32:15.070]  Sitting on a... food.
[32:16.150 --> 32:16.910]  That is, yeah.
[32:16.990 --> 32:18.350]  Both names are food.
[32:18.450 --> 32:19.270]  That's pretty good.
[32:21.450 --> 32:22.770]  Is vanilla food?
[32:23.230 --> 32:24.350]  Is ice food?
[32:25.330 --> 32:26.210]  Vanilla ice cream.
[32:26.270 --> 32:27.270]  These are things you can eat.
[32:28.830 --> 32:29.710]  Otherwise known as food.
[32:30.110 --> 32:31.170]  I guess so.
[32:31.270 --> 32:32.770]  What about non-food we eat?
[32:35.570 --> 32:36.570]  What do we open up next?
[32:36.630 --> 32:37.150]  What do you guys want to do?
[32:37.310 --> 32:39.930]  We still got like half an hour.
[32:40.830 --> 32:42.770]  Do we have a few minutes left?
[32:42.790 --> 32:43.390]  We have a few minutes left.
[32:43.790 --> 32:47.590]  Geoff, we have an hour every week to do this.
[32:47.650 --> 32:48.990]  Let's open up some Gilded Age.
[32:49.090 --> 32:50.730]  Every single Monday, most Mondays.
[32:50.990 --> 32:52.730]  This is where we pulled our Poxatawney Phil.
[32:52.730 --> 32:53.830]  Oh, yeah.
[32:54.170 --> 32:58.810]  This is where we pulled our Victorian Kathy Bates.
[32:59.010 --> 33:01.950]  I think it's right in the front somewhere.
[33:02.250 --> 33:03.370]  Oh, Candace...
[33:03.370 --> 33:06.750]  Do you guys know who Candace Wheeler is?
[33:07.610 --> 33:08.510]  She invented the wheel?
[33:08.730 --> 33:10.250]  She was an artist and textile maker.
[33:11.190 --> 33:17.310]  Oh, do you remember that time that Frederick Remington either painted that or rode with his horses?
[33:17.330 --> 33:18.830]  Or was in it?
[33:19.190 --> 33:19.810]  Let's see.
[33:21.870 --> 33:22.470]  Illustrator.
[33:24.770 --> 33:25.710]  Augustus Saint-Gaudens.
[33:26.910 --> 33:29.530]  That looks like Abraham Lincoln to me, but that's not.
[33:29.610 --> 33:31.170]  That's actually Augustus Saint-Gaudens.
[33:31.290 --> 33:32.710]  You might think it's Abraham Lincoln.
[33:32.930 --> 33:34.330]  Maybe that's who he sculpted him?
[33:34.590 --> 33:36.010]  He made it.
[33:37.210 --> 33:42.290]  Oh, the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, of which I know too much because I read that book that time.
[33:43.010 --> 33:43.870]  Devil in the White City.
[33:43.970 --> 33:45.630]  They were supposed to make a movie, but I guess they never did.
[33:46.450 --> 33:47.070]  I know.
[33:47.830 --> 33:49.810]  How come they're not making more movies right now?
[33:49.910 --> 33:50.490]  What's going on?
[33:50.490 --> 33:51.270]  What's the deal?
[33:51.790 --> 33:52.950]  What's the deal with movies?
[33:53.030 --> 33:55.910]  Do you guys remember the Great Railroad Strike of...
[33:55.910 --> 33:57.590]  That looks like a Chicago fire.
[33:59.490 --> 34:01.230]  1877 in West Virginia.
[34:01.530 --> 34:03.950]  It was when the Baltimore and Ohio B&O.
[34:03.970 --> 34:04.670]  Oh, B&O.
[34:04.750 --> 34:05.590]  Baltimore and Ohio.
[34:06.930 --> 34:09.350]  Cut wages for the third time in a year.
[34:09.470 --> 34:09.590]  Yeah.
[34:11.350 --> 34:14.350]  If Joe Biden was there, he would have said, get back to work.
[34:18.010 --> 34:20.170]  I don't know if it's appropriate to show this.
[34:20.490 --> 34:20.890]  Oh, yeah?
[34:22.930 --> 34:23.570]  Florence Nesbitt.
[34:23.750 --> 34:25.630]  That's a little...
[34:25.630 --> 34:26.070]  Oh, boy.
[34:28.750 --> 34:30.470]  There's no nudity, but it's close.
[34:32.650 --> 34:33.290]  Henrik Ibsen.
[34:33.810 --> 34:34.690]  We can't show that either.
[34:35.150 --> 34:36.990]  He looks like he's about to pull a gun out or something.
[34:37.410 --> 34:38.310]  Or he's holding his boobie.
[34:38.530 --> 34:40.110]  You know why Napoleon did that?
[34:40.410 --> 34:40.730]  Why?
[34:40.770 --> 34:44.450]  Apparently he had a lot of gastric problems and he would always keep his hand on his tummy to put pressure on it.
[34:44.830 --> 34:45.570]  That's what they say.
[34:46.470 --> 34:48.070]  This guy looks like he's about to post on 4chan.
[34:49.490 --> 34:51.330]  This guy looks like he's about to invent 4chan.
[34:52.890 --> 34:54.010]  John Phillips Sousa.
[34:54.310 --> 34:55.570]  He invented the Sousaphone.
[34:55.650 --> 34:57.010]  He's doing... that's fun.
[34:57.770 --> 34:58.150]  Oh.
[34:58.390 --> 34:58.990]  Oh, he's a conductor.
[34:59.250 --> 35:02.130]  Walt Whitman wrote Leaves of Grass.
[35:02.390 --> 35:04.110]  Hey, can you go back a couple of cards?
[35:04.290 --> 35:04.510]  I can.
[35:04.850 --> 35:05.870]  You want to go back to Frank Ibsen?
[35:05.950 --> 35:06.350]  No, one more.
[35:07.490 --> 35:08.270]  What's the name there?
[35:08.490 --> 35:09.350]  Evelyn Nesbitt.
[35:09.430 --> 35:10.050]  Oh, boy.
[35:10.450 --> 35:10.570]  Why?
[35:10.770 --> 35:11.570]  Because you said Florence.
[35:11.570 --> 35:13.890]  Somebody in the chat just pointed out he said Florence.
[35:14.050 --> 35:14.510]  Name is Evelyn.
[35:14.930 --> 35:19.070]  Oh, I said Florence because her name is Florence Evelyn Nesbitt on the back.
[35:19.150 --> 35:19.450]  Okay.
[35:19.490 --> 35:20.570]  I was reading off the back.
[35:20.650 --> 35:21.790]  Her first name is Florence, yeah.
[35:21.830 --> 35:24.050]  I thought you read it off the front and it was like, what happened?
[35:24.430 --> 35:25.690]  Using her government name.
[35:27.050 --> 35:30.950]  And then Harbor Hill where some great things happened or some terrible things happened.
[35:31.550 --> 35:33.090]  Something was invented or people died.
[35:33.410 --> 35:33.630]  Uh-huh.
[35:33.670 --> 35:34.090]  Let's see.
[35:35.310 --> 35:39.390]  It was the home of Clarence H. Mackey, the heir to the Comstock silver fortune.
[35:40.070 --> 35:40.370]  Okay.
[35:40.370 --> 35:43.130]  I think it's a little problematic how he got that fortune.
[35:43.430 --> 35:43.870]  I'm sure.
[35:44.730 --> 35:45.330]  I'm sure.
[35:46.430 --> 35:48.370]  He pulled himself up by his bootstraps.
[35:50.090 --> 35:50.970]  Nobody was...
[35:50.970 --> 35:51.530]  Silver bootstraps.
[35:53.450 --> 35:54.470]  Let's open up some...
[35:54.470 --> 35:55.250]  Oh, yeah.
[35:55.750 --> 35:56.570]  Let's do it.
[35:56.810 --> 35:57.790]  We don't ever open these up.
[36:00.230 --> 36:01.490]  He'll be on soon, I think.
[36:01.670 --> 36:04.750]  Next week, well, I'll announce it right now.
[36:04.750 --> 36:05.610]  I can't get it up.
[36:06.630 --> 36:09.010]  Next week, we are going to have...
[36:09.010 --> 36:09.470]  It's too hard.
[36:09.470 --> 36:09.730]  Okay.
[36:10.030 --> 36:13.130]  Next week, we're going to have Gustavo Sorolla on the show.
[36:13.170 --> 36:13.890]  The internet's known.
[36:14.190 --> 36:17.830]  And we are going to be going through his collection from his childhood.
[36:17.990 --> 36:19.590]  Go through a bunch of those old cards and stuff.
[36:19.630 --> 36:19.810]  Yeah.
[36:19.910 --> 36:23.790]  He apparently bought like 40,000 baseball cards from a Walmart when they were on clearance
[36:23.790 --> 36:26.290]  and then put them in a storage facility and never opened them.
[36:26.290 --> 36:26.450]  Yep.
[36:27.370 --> 36:27.730]  So...
[36:27.730 --> 36:28.950]  And next week, tune in.
[36:29.130 --> 36:31.090]  Gustavo Sorolla is here on The Break Show.
[36:32.310 --> 36:32.910]  Pussy Flip.
[36:34.570 --> 36:36.450]  Pretend I'm singing a Minutemen song.
[36:36.910 --> 36:38.350]  Well, if you're going to be dumb, you got to be tough.
[36:39.470 --> 36:39.510]  Okay.
[36:40.170 --> 36:43.350]  Speaking of all great things...
[36:44.670 --> 36:45.890]  Oh, my God.
[36:45.990 --> 36:47.130]  Johnny Knoxville spanking.
[36:47.730 --> 36:48.030]  Wee Man.
[36:49.350 --> 36:50.490]  I love it.
[36:51.370 --> 36:53.970]  Here's Behind the Lens from Jackass the Movie.
[36:54.030 --> 36:55.050]  This is from the first movie.
[36:55.550 --> 36:56.910]  I guess they got...
[36:56.910 --> 36:59.310]  With the clippers.
[36:59.790 --> 37:00.010]  Yeah.
[37:00.250 --> 37:00.710]  I can't tell.
[37:00.730 --> 37:02.350]  Is that Danger Aaron when he was very young?
[37:02.510 --> 37:03.530]  I don't think so.
[37:03.550 --> 37:04.670]  Before he lost some of his teeth?
[37:09.790 --> 37:13.290]  That was so fucking funny.
[37:13.670 --> 37:14.650]  Oh, that was so funny.
[37:14.650 --> 37:16.790]  Just, boom.
[37:16.910 --> 37:18.270]  He's the hardest puncher on earth.
[37:18.410 --> 37:18.710]  Yeah.
[37:20.210 --> 37:24.070]  To get him for that and it's just like, you're asking for so much trouble.
[37:24.190 --> 37:24.910]  Did he punch Dunn?
[37:25.570 --> 37:26.810]  No, no, this is...
[37:26.810 --> 37:27.490]  Dunn did the girl.
[37:28.370 --> 37:29.670]  Dunn's been dead for a while.
[37:29.670 --> 37:32.870]  No, no, no, I'm saying that in the episode where he was boxing some...
[37:32.870 --> 37:34.430]  They put Ryan Dunn with like a...
[37:34.430 --> 37:36.050]  That was like an Asian kickboxer?
[37:36.070 --> 37:36.670]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[37:36.670 --> 37:38.450]  This is from the new movie.
[37:38.470 --> 37:39.350]  Oh, this is from the movie.
[37:39.890 --> 37:41.110]  This one's from the new movie, yeah.
[37:41.630 --> 37:43.450]  We got a legend card, Spike Jones.
[37:43.810 --> 37:44.370]  Spike Jones!
[37:44.850 --> 37:47.330]  And then, Tackled by Jalen Reynolds.
[37:51.990 --> 37:52.730]  That's awesome.
[37:52.770 --> 37:52.990]  Those are great.
[37:53.150 --> 37:53.630]  Those are fun.
[37:53.690 --> 37:54.290]  That's really good.
[37:54.410 --> 37:55.330]  God damn, I like that.
[37:55.390 --> 37:56.690]  Let's open up some country classics.
[37:56.750 --> 37:57.150]  Alright.
[37:59.210 --> 38:01.330]  What would be considered your chase card out of this?
[38:01.430 --> 38:01.890]  Conway Twitty.
[38:01.890 --> 38:02.430]  Okay.
[38:04.010 --> 38:05.310]  I'd say Hank One.
[38:05.490 --> 38:07.850]  But I think we're going to get a lot of Hank Two.
[38:09.310 --> 38:10.070]  Speaking of...
[38:10.070 --> 38:11.810]  Anyway, here's Hank Junior.
[38:13.090 --> 38:13.530]  Sucks.
[38:13.750 --> 38:15.350]  He does suck. Doug Kershaw.
[38:15.790 --> 38:17.690]  He might suck, I don't know. Probably doesn't.
[38:18.130 --> 38:19.750]  Oh, here's a good one. Gene Autry.
[38:20.050 --> 38:20.250]  Alright.
[38:21.610 --> 38:22.570]  Roy Acuff.
[38:24.570 --> 38:25.530]  Clint Black.
[38:25.710 --> 38:27.390]  Showing us a lot of Clint Crouch.
[38:29.110 --> 38:30.070]  Danielle Alexander.
[38:30.070 --> 38:32.030]  She's about to drop a deuce in the woods.
[38:32.290 --> 38:33.350]  Oh, no.
[38:34.770 --> 38:35.490]  Linda Ronstadt.
[38:35.590 --> 38:36.730]  Hanging out with the piggies.
[38:37.690 --> 38:39.690]  Here's the Ryman Auditorium.
[38:40.290 --> 38:40.650]  Iconic.
[38:41.630 --> 38:42.450]  I'll take your word for it.
[38:42.490 --> 38:44.170]  Yeah, it's where Grand Ole Opry started.
[38:46.510 --> 38:47.230]  Neil McCoy.
[38:48.470 --> 38:49.330]  I don't like that.
[38:49.770 --> 38:51.710]  I was going to say I like that shirt, but I don't like that shirt.
[38:51.790 --> 38:52.250]  Oh, right.
[38:53.170 --> 38:53.530]  Nemesis.
[38:53.670 --> 38:54.530]  I didn't mean to show that to you.
[38:54.770 --> 38:54.850]  Yes.
[38:54.850 --> 38:56.790]  And then Ronna Reeves.
[38:58.270 --> 39:00.130]  Say that I've heard of Ronna Reeves.
[39:00.310 --> 39:01.950]  Ronna. I've never heard that name, Ronna.
[39:02.110 --> 39:02.870]  It's like Donna with an R.
[39:03.450 --> 39:04.350]  Ronna. Maybe Ronna.
[39:04.790 --> 39:05.090]  I like it.
[39:05.190 --> 39:08.330]  Ronna's flair for showmanship was evident at a very early age.
[39:08.890 --> 39:10.150]  Great. Good for her.
[39:10.270 --> 39:10.430]  Yeah.
[39:13.430 --> 39:15.290]  You want to get into Pac-Sec?
[39:15.370 --> 39:16.710]  Or you got some other stuff that you want to open?
[39:16.870 --> 39:17.170]  Let's do some fun stuff.
[39:17.350 --> 39:18.150]  Yeah, there we go.
[39:18.270 --> 39:21.070]  Let's open up some shit that I'm going to really enjoy.
[39:21.270 --> 39:23.830]  Okay. I mean, that's kind of why we made a whole show about this.
[39:24.850 --> 39:26.010]  I was talking about this the other day.
[39:26.110 --> 39:29.770]  I've been buying this collection for us for over three years now.
[39:30.390 --> 39:35.870]  So I would say seven out of every ten boxes of baseball cards I buy, I don't open.
[39:36.130 --> 39:37.890]  They go into my closet in storage.
[39:38.150 --> 39:41.090]  And so I have to step over these every day of my life to get dressed.
[39:41.810 --> 39:44.490]  And I've been wanting to open some of this stuff for years.
[39:44.650 --> 39:45.730]  It's been driving me nuts.
[39:45.970 --> 39:47.250]  Weekly, we can do this.
[39:47.410 --> 39:48.610]  Weekly. Every week.
[39:48.630 --> 39:49.850]  Every week, most Mondays.
[39:49.870 --> 39:54.190]  We've got a blaster, NBA Select 22-23.
[39:54.190 --> 39:55.490]  These are gorgeous cards.
[39:55.790 --> 39:57.130]  Same structure.
[39:57.510 --> 39:59.110]  Four cards per pack. Six packs.
[39:59.590 --> 40:00.370]  That's how we do it.
[40:00.670 --> 40:01.630]  And let's see what we get.
[40:01.690 --> 40:02.890]  These are going to be good. We're going to like these.
[40:02.990 --> 40:04.330]  Luca Base.
[40:04.350 --> 40:05.170]  We like it.
[40:05.410 --> 40:06.370]  Nikola Jovic.
[40:06.610 --> 40:08.030]  Would you sleeve that for me?
[40:08.030 --> 40:08.550]  It doesn't go anywhere.
[40:09.490 --> 40:11.370]  Luca, that's a new photo for him.
[40:11.430 --> 40:12.170]  I haven't seen that one.
[40:12.290 --> 40:12.970]  With his tongue out?
[40:13.510 --> 40:15.050]  And he's even been like...
[40:15.050 --> 40:15.950]  And he's got his cool hands?
[40:16.170 --> 40:16.970]  Yeah, cool hands.
[40:17.250 --> 40:18.430]  Oh, maybe he's like...
[40:18.430 --> 40:19.350]  Should we do a like...
[40:19.350 --> 40:20.110]  Cool hands Luca.
[40:21.070 --> 40:21.670]  That's good.
[40:21.910 --> 40:22.510]  That's good.
[40:23.210 --> 40:23.830]  That's just...
[40:23.830 --> 40:24.130]  That's good.
[40:24.210 --> 40:24.930]  That's just funny.
[40:25.130 --> 40:25.530]  That's good.
[40:25.630 --> 40:26.290]  Cool hands Luca.
[40:26.470 --> 40:30.830]  I was going to say, should we do like a bunch of dudes that look like they're doing like
[40:30.830 --> 40:31.390]  gang signs.
[40:31.510 --> 40:32.410]  But we'll just go with like...
[40:32.410 --> 40:32.930]  I like cool...
[40:32.930 --> 40:34.650]  Instead of Cripwalking Luca, we'll go with...
[40:34.650 --> 40:34.850]  Yeah.
[40:34.930 --> 40:35.510]  Cool hands Luca.
[40:35.710 --> 40:36.190]  Cool hands Luca.
[40:37.050 --> 40:40.670]  Darius Garland, who I heard might be a trade rumor, which I think is a shame because he's
[40:40.670 --> 40:41.110]  phenomenal.
[40:41.810 --> 40:45.410]  Oh, and then Orange Shock, I believe, is the parallel.
[40:46.070 --> 40:46.710]  Damien Lillard.
[40:46.890 --> 40:47.210]  Hey.
[40:48.010 --> 40:48.330]  He...
[40:48.330 --> 40:48.950]  He...
[40:48.950 --> 40:50.210]  He wants to leave.
[40:50.210 --> 40:52.730]  He's causing rule changes in the NBA.
[40:52.810 --> 40:53.470]  Did you know?
[40:53.470 --> 40:54.270]  In the NBA...
[40:54.270 --> 40:54.850]  Wait, what?
[40:54.950 --> 40:55.250]  Like what?
[40:55.330 --> 41:00.690]  Did you know the Players Association is frowning upon the way he is conducting his business?
[41:01.150 --> 41:01.910]  They are not happy with him.
[41:01.950 --> 41:03.490]  They are fucking furious.
[41:04.170 --> 41:08.350]  The NBA sent out a notice to all teams that said, listen, if you have a superstar on your
[41:08.350 --> 41:13.370]  team who is demanding a trade to a single team, we will suspend him and fine him.
[41:13.410 --> 41:13.850]  Wow.
[41:14.010 --> 41:15.170]  You're not allowed to do...
[41:15.170 --> 41:15.930]  You can't do this shit.
[41:15.930 --> 41:17.050]  You are not allowed to do that.
[41:17.310 --> 41:18.590]  You can't say, send me to Miami or nothing.
[41:18.930 --> 41:19.790]  Yeah, Miami or nothing.
[41:19.930 --> 41:20.690]  You cannot do that.
[41:20.750 --> 41:22.030]  They are not going to put up with that shit anymore.
[41:22.410 --> 41:25.130]  So, is he suddenly going to have like a sore back and he can't play?
[41:25.750 --> 41:28.650]  That's the rumor, but I don't think so because he's...
[41:28.650 --> 41:29.370]  The guy's too competitive.
[41:29.630 --> 41:31.430]  But it's a real shame because he has...
[41:31.430 --> 41:34.310]  That's a dude who everybody in the NBA loved who has now lost...
[41:34.850 --> 41:37.090]  Kind of did a Kevin Durant thing and now a lot of people are like...
[41:37.090 --> 41:39.130]  Maybe he got seasonal depression in Portland.
[41:39.510 --> 41:39.910]  It's possible.
[41:40.110 --> 41:40.790]  It's entirely possible.
[41:41.150 --> 41:42.910]  Yeah, I think he got...
[41:44.050 --> 41:45.950]  Being on a small market team depression.
[41:46.150 --> 41:46.450]  Depression, yeah.
[41:46.610 --> 41:47.230]  That'll do it.
[41:47.230 --> 41:48.830]  Anthony Edwards, your three card.
[41:49.310 --> 41:52.170]  Future of the NBA right there if he can stop being a dickhead off court.
[41:52.950 --> 41:54.130]  Michael Porter Jr.
[41:54.670 --> 41:55.330]  We call him MPJ.
[41:55.450 --> 41:56.970]  Benedict Matheran rookie.
[41:57.210 --> 41:58.110]  We'll sleeve that.
[41:58.690 --> 41:59.390]  I have a lot...
[41:59.390 --> 41:59.930]  He's my guy.
[42:00.130 --> 42:01.650]  I have a lot of hope in Benedict Matheran.
[42:01.770 --> 42:02.530]  Yeah, I really...
[42:02.530 --> 42:03.710]  I feel good about him.
[42:04.490 --> 42:05.170]  Oh, here we go.
[42:05.730 --> 42:07.270]  Jalen Green, year two.
[42:07.490 --> 42:08.090]  This is a...
[42:08.090 --> 42:10.790]  It's hard to tell in these select blue cards, but this is a prism.
[42:11.110 --> 42:13.290]  It's just slightly...
[42:13.290 --> 42:13.750]  I can see that.
[42:13.770 --> 42:14.670]  Shinier than the others.
[42:15.130 --> 42:16.110]  Got a little bit more orange.
[42:16.110 --> 42:16.650]  Yeah.
[42:16.810 --> 42:17.130]  Yes.
[42:17.990 --> 42:19.090]  How are you feeling about these so far?
[42:19.190 --> 42:19.890]  I'm feeling great about these.
[42:19.990 --> 42:20.870]  That's what it's supposed to look like.
[42:20.910 --> 42:24.410]  When we open up those Monopoly cards and it was just like base card after base card after...
[42:24.410 --> 42:26.190]  It's like, cool, I got nine Austin Reeves.
[42:27.590 --> 42:28.510]  That's what it was supposed to be.
[42:28.590 --> 42:29.130]  It's supposed to...
[42:29.130 --> 42:31.090]  Fucking cards that are good and fun.
[42:32.310 --> 42:32.950]  Devin Vassell.
[42:33.590 --> 42:34.670]  Peyton Watson rookie.
[42:34.790 --> 42:35.170]  I'll be honest.
[42:35.230 --> 42:37.250]  I don't know who Peyton Watson is, but we'll sleeve that.
[42:37.630 --> 42:37.910]  Ooh.
[42:38.230 --> 42:38.910]  I want a championship.
[42:39.610 --> 42:39.930]  Zion.
[42:40.750 --> 42:43.110]  Will he ever play an NBA game again?
[42:43.210 --> 42:43.530]  No.
[42:44.150 --> 42:44.470]  Please.
[42:44.830 --> 42:45.630]  For the love of God.
[42:45.630 --> 42:48.790]  Oh, speaking of Zion, there's his select Pelican.
[42:49.010 --> 42:49.350]  Nice.
[42:50.170 --> 42:51.090]  I don't know what...
[42:51.090 --> 42:52.450]  Do you think he'll play?
[42:52.550 --> 42:53.850]  He has to, right?
[42:54.290 --> 42:55.010]  We'll sleeve that.
[42:55.010 --> 42:56.190]  He has to play.
[42:56.230 --> 42:57.110]  Yeah, he will, of course.
[42:57.130 --> 42:57.650]  He has to.
[42:57.730 --> 42:58.530]  Will he stay healthy?
[43:00.750 --> 43:02.910]  He's been perpetually hurt for...
[43:03.610 --> 43:04.270]  His entire career.
[43:04.410 --> 43:04.610]  Yeah.
[43:04.750 --> 43:05.010]  Yeah.
[43:05.190 --> 43:07.170]  He had like the knee problems and then he had...
[43:07.170 --> 43:08.770]  He was supposed to be like the guy.
[43:08.990 --> 43:10.890]  He was supposed to come in and be like this big game changer.
[43:11.370 --> 43:12.190]  And he just...
[43:12.190 --> 43:13.750]  He can't stay healthy and he can't...
[43:13.750 --> 43:14.590]  It's like Kauai, man.
[43:14.590 --> 43:15.350]  He just made out of glass.
[43:15.550 --> 43:16.410]  He can't...
[43:16.410 --> 43:19.770]  He's too heavy to put that much stress on his body.
[43:19.930 --> 43:22.390]  And he needs to slim up a little bit or he's not going to have a long career.
[43:22.450 --> 43:23.070]  Josh Giddy.
[43:23.390 --> 43:23.750]  Here we go.
[43:26.990 --> 43:27.570]  Marky Smart.
[43:27.830 --> 43:28.130]  Yay!
[43:28.570 --> 43:28.870]  Nice.
[43:29.470 --> 43:30.410]  I feel like I need to...
[43:30.410 --> 43:30.750]  Marcus?
[43:30.910 --> 43:31.730]  Screw it in my mouth, man.
[43:31.730 --> 43:32.750]  You are the young game changer.
[43:33.070 --> 43:34.270]  No matter what team you're on.
[43:34.550 --> 43:38.710]  And I want you to know that whether your hair is green or your hair is blue, I'm going to
[43:38.710 --> 43:39.830]  love you just the same.
[43:40.010 --> 43:44.030]  I will root for the Celtics over you, but only the Celtics over you.
[43:44.030 --> 43:48.330]  I am now officially a Grizzlies fan, even though I've previously hated them, because
[43:48.330 --> 43:51.870]  the greatest player of all time, Marcus Smart, is on there.
[43:52.390 --> 43:53.030]  Just leave that.
[43:53.590 --> 43:53.930]  Amen.
[43:54.770 --> 43:55.090]  Amen.
[43:56.750 --> 43:57.510]  Speaking from the heart.
[43:57.650 --> 43:57.810]  Yeah.
[43:57.990 --> 43:59.370]  I feel that way about Patrick Beverley.
[43:59.790 --> 44:00.130]  Wendell...
[44:00.850 --> 44:01.810]  Wendell Moore Jr.
[44:02.350 --> 44:03.910]  Should he just have, like, a Marcus Smart?
[44:03.910 --> 44:04.650]  Joe LMB.
[44:05.590 --> 44:06.270]  I'll just take that one.
[44:06.270 --> 44:07.870]  Yeah, I was going to say, I think that's just when he keys.
[44:07.990 --> 44:09.010]  Yeah, that won't stay here.
[44:09.110 --> 44:11.650]  Could you imagine if someone felt that strongly about Pat, though?
[44:11.770 --> 44:12.570]  That would be really funny.
[44:12.570 --> 44:14.210]  There's, like, three dudes out there that do.
[44:14.270 --> 44:14.870]  That would be really funny.
[44:14.870 --> 44:15.910]  Like, Pat Bev apologists.
[44:15.930 --> 44:16.070]  Yeah.
[44:16.990 --> 44:18.170]  Colin Sexton-Bace.
[44:18.570 --> 44:20.470]  I really like the yellow in that.
[44:20.510 --> 44:20.810]  Oh, it's cool.
[44:21.010 --> 44:21.350]  It pops, doesn't it?
[44:21.650 --> 44:23.430]  That's not, like, a parallel or anything, right?
[44:23.550 --> 44:24.910]  It's just a jazz color.
[44:25.010 --> 44:25.090]  Yeah.
[44:26.470 --> 44:27.290]  Oh, that's cool.
[44:27.490 --> 44:27.810]  LeBron.
[44:30.530 --> 44:31.350]  What is that?
[44:31.590 --> 44:32.110]  He's angry.
[44:33.250 --> 44:33.910]  That's when he got it.
[44:33.970 --> 44:36.510]  That's the second that he got his high ankle sprain.
[44:37.650 --> 44:38.550]  Coming off of that season.
[44:38.810 --> 44:39.290]  I'll just leave that.
[44:40.070 --> 44:41.730]  I know I didn't save the other LeBron, but I'll save that one.
[44:41.730 --> 44:43.850]  Tyler Herro, most punchable face in the NBA.
[44:44.330 --> 44:44.650]  100%.
[44:44.650 --> 44:49.350]  And followed closely by his teammate, Duncan Robinson.
[44:50.130 --> 44:50.930]  Fred Van Vliet.
[44:51.070 --> 44:55.110]  This is Houston's newest superstar, Fred Van Vliet.
[44:55.190 --> 44:56.330]  Oh, did he get signed?
[44:56.330 --> 44:58.430]  He got a max contract with Houston, yeah.
[44:58.470 --> 44:58.670]  Wow.
[44:59.170 --> 45:00.510]  He got a max contract?
[45:00.510 --> 45:03.950]  He's the first NBA player, I think, to ever get an undrafted player to get a max contract.
[45:04.750 --> 45:06.070]  Wow, that's fucking wild.
[45:06.170 --> 45:06.910]  I'm pretty sure he did, yeah.
[45:07.050 --> 45:07.950]  I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure.
[45:08.190 --> 45:09.790]  And this is Prism, so we'll select that.
[45:09.790 --> 45:13.050]  I mean, him on that team with Kawhi, that Raptors team was like...
[45:13.050 --> 45:14.310]  Just another undersized point guard.
[45:14.470 --> 45:15.050]  100%, yeah.
[45:15.770 --> 45:16.870]  I can't believe he got a max contract.
[45:16.990 --> 45:17.830]  That's crazy, I didn't know that.
[45:17.950 --> 45:18.590]  He's gonna be a Rocket.
[45:18.730 --> 45:19.290]  Holy shit.
[45:19.750 --> 45:20.970]  It's gonna be a weird team, those Rockets.
[45:22.290 --> 45:23.430]  That is gonna be a weird team.
[45:23.530 --> 45:23.890]  That's fun.
[45:24.050 --> 45:27.050]  It's like him and 11 second year players.
[45:27.330 --> 45:31.230]  He has the second most threes in Toronto history.
[45:31.710 --> 45:31.870]  Yeah.
[45:31.990 --> 45:33.050]  Yeah, I mean, that's...
[45:33.050 --> 45:33.550]  That sounds right.
[45:33.790 --> 45:34.170]  Fun fact.
[45:35.170 --> 45:35.890]  Brandon Ingram.
[45:36.230 --> 45:36.350]  Okay.
[45:37.630 --> 45:39.090]  Oh, Jalen Williams.
[45:39.090 --> 45:42.110]  Is that the good Jalen Williams or the okay Jalen Williams?
[45:42.150 --> 45:42.950]  I can never keep them straight.
[45:43.030 --> 45:43.750]  I think it's the good one.
[45:44.390 --> 45:47.030]  Two Jalen Williams, both rookies, both on OKC.
[45:47.270 --> 45:47.450]  What?
[45:47.670 --> 45:48.870]  They just pronounce Jalen different.
[45:49.270 --> 45:49.990]  Or say Jalen.
[45:49.990 --> 45:50.590]  How do they pronounce it the other way?
[45:50.690 --> 45:51.670]  J-A-L...
[45:51.670 --> 45:53.690]  J-A-L-E-N.
[45:53.950 --> 45:54.270]  Uh-huh.
[45:54.350 --> 45:58.370]  And the other one is J-A-Y-L-E-N or O-N.
[45:58.870 --> 45:59.470]  I can't remember which.
[45:59.530 --> 45:59.730]  Wow.
[45:59.910 --> 46:00.710]  We'll probably pull them today.
[46:01.030 --> 46:02.610]  DeMar DeRozan, base card.
[46:02.950 --> 46:07.810]  And then, oh, the green, white, and purple parallel Nikola Jovic rookie.
[46:08.010 --> 46:08.910]  That's a cool card.
[46:08.910 --> 46:09.470]  Wow.
[46:09.710 --> 46:10.270]  That's a legit hit.
[46:10.330 --> 46:10.870]  We'll save that.
[46:10.950 --> 46:11.650]  It's like Joker style.
[46:11.830 --> 46:12.050]  Yeah.
[46:12.150 --> 46:13.610]  It's not funny or anything, but it's...
[46:13.610 --> 46:13.810]  Wait.
[46:14.590 --> 46:15.650]  This is a different one?
[46:15.710 --> 46:16.810]  Not Nikola...
[46:16.810 --> 46:17.570]  Not Jokic.
[46:17.690 --> 46:18.470]  That's Jovic.
[46:18.930 --> 46:19.450]  It's a different guy.
[46:19.630 --> 46:20.190]  Different dude.
[46:20.350 --> 46:20.650]  Okay.
[46:20.830 --> 46:21.190]  I know.
[46:22.270 --> 46:22.810]  I know.
[46:22.910 --> 46:25.550]  It's like having Jalen, J-A-L-E-N.
[46:25.730 --> 46:26.870]  And then J-A-Y-L-E-N.
[46:26.870 --> 46:27.770]  Jalen and then J-A-L-E-N.
[46:27.770 --> 46:27.950]  Okay.
[46:28.170 --> 46:30.530]  What do you think you want to get into here?
[46:30.830 --> 46:31.450]  We got pack...
[46:31.450 --> 46:32.330]  We can pack sack it.
[46:32.530 --> 46:33.510]  We have...
[46:33.510 --> 46:34.670]  I got something special.
[46:34.990 --> 46:35.210]  Oh.
[46:35.350 --> 46:37.710]  I got a couple of special things that I want to open.
[46:37.710 --> 46:38.010]  Okay.
[46:38.090 --> 46:38.470]  Let's get...
[46:38.470 --> 46:38.870]  We got like...
[46:38.870 --> 46:39.990]  We have two special things left.
[46:40.090 --> 46:41.890]  I want people to stick around for the last 14 minutes.
[46:41.990 --> 46:42.130]  Okay.
[46:42.310 --> 46:44.850]  And also buy a waffle maker.
[46:45.030 --> 46:45.210]  Yeah.
[46:45.270 --> 46:46.250]  Buy a waffle maker if you want.
[46:46.310 --> 46:47.210]  We also have a pizza cutter.
[46:47.330 --> 46:47.730]  If you have a pizza...
[46:47.730 --> 46:48.270]  Oh, that's right.
[46:48.450 --> 46:48.490]  Yeah.
[46:48.490 --> 46:49.350]  You need a pizza cutter.
[46:49.910 --> 46:52.010]  Also, if you want to buy clothes, there's a Geoff line.
[46:52.110 --> 46:52.530]  I got a hat.
[46:52.550 --> 46:52.970]  I got a shirt.
[46:53.010 --> 46:53.450]  I got shorts.
[46:53.830 --> 46:54.410]  Sell, sell, sell.
[46:54.670 --> 46:55.150]  That's all...
[46:55.150 --> 46:55.290]  Also...
[46:55.290 --> 46:56.070]  That's a whole outfit.
[46:56.310 --> 46:56.950]  That's a whole outfit.
[46:57.050 --> 46:58.090]  It's a whole summer outfit.
[46:58.170 --> 47:01.830]  You can wear it while you make your pizzas in the waffle maker and then cut...
[47:01.830 --> 47:02.410]  And then cut them.
[47:02.510 --> 47:03.070]  That's really smart.
[47:03.070 --> 47:04.350]  I found out about these.
[47:04.570 --> 47:06.410]  I rushed to buy them.
[47:06.510 --> 47:06.910]  Okay.
[47:07.170 --> 47:07.970]  Because of Eric.
[47:08.230 --> 47:10.350]  Because I wanted to do something special for Eric.
[47:10.390 --> 47:11.270]  You work so hard.
[47:11.510 --> 47:12.130]  I don't...
[47:12.130 --> 47:13.050]  I want to do something special for Eric.
[47:13.210 --> 47:13.750]  I don't...
[47:13.750 --> 47:14.530]  When people leave...
[47:14.530 --> 47:15.330]  I know how much he loves...
[47:15.330 --> 47:15.570]  Oh!
[47:15.990 --> 47:17.410]  Oh, before you get into this...
[47:17.410 --> 47:18.050]  The shirt's on sale.
[47:18.410 --> 47:19.010]  Oh, what?
[47:19.010 --> 47:19.310]  They did it.
[47:19.310 --> 47:20.190]  They're doing like a...
[47:20.190 --> 47:22.970]  So, we were waiting to see if this was actually going to happen during the stream.
[47:23.150 --> 47:23.950]  And it happened.
[47:24.230 --> 47:28.590]  If you go to SwordArtsChief.com right now, the Break Show logo shirt is out now.
[47:28.850 --> 47:29.250]  Ooh.
[47:29.570 --> 47:30.450]  Love this shirt.
[47:30.650 --> 47:30.830]  Yeah.
[47:30.830 --> 47:33.570]  Really excited that we actually got this made.
[47:34.430 --> 47:35.070]  That's awesome.
[47:35.290 --> 47:37.690]  And if you don't buy any of this stuff, that's okay too.
[47:37.890 --> 47:39.770]  If you just want to watch us open cards, we're not...
[47:39.770 --> 47:40.450]  Here's the thing.
[47:40.670 --> 47:42.450]  We have to tell you about this stuff.
[47:42.530 --> 47:43.430]  Yeah, but we're not trying to pressure you.
[47:43.430 --> 47:44.330]  I'm not trying to say...
[47:44.330 --> 47:45.010]  You have to do this.
[47:45.130 --> 47:46.130]  I don't expect you to.
[47:46.270 --> 47:48.990]  But I have to let you know this is there because here's what happens.
[47:49.110 --> 47:50.010]  People leave comments and they go,
[47:50.170 --> 47:51.650]  I didn't even know Waffle Maker came out.
[47:51.870 --> 47:52.070]  Right.
[47:52.170 --> 47:52.870]  So, when you go,
[47:52.950 --> 47:53.750]  I don't even know about this stuff.
[47:53.930 --> 47:54.570]  It's not for you then.
[47:54.790 --> 47:55.470]  It's for somebody else.
[47:55.710 --> 47:56.210]  That's all.
[47:56.470 --> 47:57.750]  So, SwordArtsChief.com.
[47:58.170 --> 47:58.770]  Get that shirt.
[47:59.110 --> 47:59.910]  Guy who doesn't want it.
[47:59.910 --> 48:00.030]  Get it.
[48:00.090 --> 48:00.710]  Or don't.
[48:01.010 --> 48:01.510]  It's fine.
[48:01.890 --> 48:02.770]  Eric's getting all wound up.
[48:03.190 --> 48:04.550]  Which is why I'm going to...
[48:04.550 --> 48:04.910]  I'm going to...
[48:04.910 --> 48:05.530]  I'm going to...
[48:05.530 --> 48:06.010]  That's pretty good.
[48:06.190 --> 48:07.970]  I'm going to soothe the savage beast.
[48:07.970 --> 48:09.350]  I'm not going to look at what it is until...
[48:09.350 --> 48:09.530]  With...
[48:10.230 --> 48:12.130]  Garbage Pail Kids and...
[48:12.130 --> 48:12.790]  Oh!
[48:13.510 --> 48:13.830]  Oh boy.
[48:13.830 --> 48:15.870]  And View Askew crossover.
[48:16.350 --> 48:19.350]  We've got Jay and Silent Bob Garbage Pail Kids.
[48:19.550 --> 48:20.750]  That seems terrible.
[48:21.230 --> 48:21.930]  I can't wait.
[48:21.930 --> 48:22.930]  Yeah, no shit.
[48:23.430 --> 48:25.210]  I know how much you love Garbage Pail Kids.
[48:25.330 --> 48:26.850]  And you know how much I love View Askew.
[48:26.850 --> 48:28.070]  There's like more here.
[48:28.370 --> 48:28.650]  Yeah.
[48:28.650 --> 48:29.610]  I don't...
[48:29.610 --> 48:30.610]  Yeah, we're never going to get to the end of them.
[48:30.750 --> 48:31.250]  Oh, thank God.
[48:33.770 --> 48:36.850]  Okay, so you got Jay and Silent Bob Garbage Pail Kids.
[48:36.850 --> 48:37.070]  Garbage Pail Kids.
[48:37.150 --> 48:39.330]  I assume they'll all be related to View Askew stuff.
[48:39.330 --> 48:40.110]  Oh, they're called Mallrats.
[48:40.210 --> 48:40.690]  Oh, here we go.
[48:40.870 --> 48:42.030]  Don't Quit Quint.
[48:42.570 --> 48:43.150]  There you go.
[48:43.170 --> 48:43.990]  Oh, that is...
[48:43.990 --> 48:45.470]  I mean, that's from Mallrats.
[48:45.510 --> 48:46.230]  Yeah, that's from Mallrats.
[48:46.690 --> 48:48.010]  When they're all showing off their scars or whatever.
[48:48.290 --> 48:48.470]  What?
[48:48.550 --> 48:50.010]  No, that's him proposing...
[48:50.010 --> 48:50.910]  Oh, right, right, right.
[48:50.930 --> 48:51.310]  No, you're right.
[48:51.330 --> 48:52.610]  That's the plot of Mallrats.
[48:52.770 --> 48:53.150]  You're right.
[48:53.190 --> 48:53.430]  You're right.
[48:54.270 --> 48:55.250]  The inciting incident.
[48:55.330 --> 48:55.610]  Yes.
[48:55.850 --> 48:56.730]  Jarring Jared.
[48:57.510 --> 48:58.150]  Oh, no.
[48:58.230 --> 48:59.470]  It's the chocolate covered pretzel.
[48:59.690 --> 49:00.230]  Michael Rooker.
[49:00.370 --> 49:00.950]  Is that who that was?
[49:01.310 --> 49:02.090]  No, was that Rooker?
[49:02.270 --> 49:02.510]  What?
[49:02.750 --> 49:03.370]  No, who was it?
[49:03.410 --> 49:03.770]  I don't know.
[49:03.850 --> 49:05.390]  But I don't think it was him.
[49:06.070 --> 49:06.390]  Jason...
[49:06.390 --> 49:06.890]  Ew.
[49:07.570 --> 49:08.190]  Oh, I get it.
[49:08.330 --> 49:08.570]  It's like Jason.
[49:08.570 --> 49:10.890]  And then alternating Austin.
[49:11.950 --> 49:12.450]  I'll be honest.
[49:12.570 --> 49:13.010]  I don't know.
[49:13.110 --> 49:14.150]  Is it like a Kiss concert?
[49:14.350 --> 49:15.150]  I don't know who that is.
[49:16.210 --> 49:17.030]  Can you say what movie it is?
[49:18.230 --> 49:18.550]  No.
[49:18.730 --> 49:18.950]  Okay.
[49:19.450 --> 49:21.410]  I haven't watched from...
[49:22.070 --> 49:22.590]  I haven't...
[49:22.590 --> 49:23.250]  From Chasing Amy.
[49:23.270 --> 49:24.090]  I've seen Chasing Amy.
[49:24.190 --> 49:24.790]  It was the last one I saw.
[49:24.870 --> 49:25.630]  I haven't seen anything past that.
[49:25.630 --> 49:26.730]  No, James Hammond Bob's awesome.
[49:26.730 --> 49:27.010]  Yeah, James Hammond.
[49:27.330 --> 49:27.770]  I don't know.
[49:28.850 --> 49:29.490]  Silent Bobby.
[49:29.930 --> 49:31.710]  You can't talk because he's got a little...
[49:31.710 --> 49:31.730]  Yeah.
[49:31.730 --> 49:32.670]  He's got a padlock on his...
[49:32.670 --> 49:33.570]  Oh, here we go.
[49:33.890 --> 49:34.330]  This is a parallel.
[49:35.010 --> 49:35.650]  Thumbs Upton.
[49:36.370 --> 49:37.010]  Oh, yeah.
[49:37.250 --> 49:37.570]  It's...
[49:37.910 --> 49:38.230]  Jesus.
[49:38.450 --> 49:38.610]  Yep.
[49:38.710 --> 49:39.350]  I just went to sleep with that.
[49:39.350 --> 49:39.930]  You didn't see Dogma?
[49:42.390 --> 49:43.250]  Yes, I did.
[49:43.290 --> 49:43.690]  I did see...
[49:43.690 --> 49:44.450]  That was the last one I saw.
[49:45.030 --> 49:45.670]  Buddy Bud.
[49:46.330 --> 49:47.190]  That's the same as Thumbs Upton.
[49:47.190 --> 49:48.450]  Right, but it's a different dude.
[49:48.510 --> 49:48.650]  Yeah.
[49:48.710 --> 49:49.010]  Oh, yeah.
[49:49.110 --> 49:49.730]  We do, like...
[49:49.730 --> 49:51.290]  Oh, and then there's the Mooby cow, right?
[49:51.550 --> 49:51.730]  Cash cow?
[49:52.790 --> 49:56.750]  Garbage Pail Kids does a bullshit thing where they just name things different things.
[49:56.850 --> 49:57.590]  You get two cards.
[49:57.610 --> 49:58.250]  It's like the same thing, but different.
[49:58.370 --> 50:00.070]  Out of the same card because they have double names.
[50:00.130 --> 50:00.590]  Yeah, it's stupid.
[50:00.730 --> 50:01.290]  It's pretty dumb.
[50:01.830 --> 50:03.530]  It's a parallel, so we should hang on to it.
[50:03.570 --> 50:04.810]  Yeah, it just goes in the same thing.
[50:05.010 --> 50:05.030]  Yeah.
[50:05.050 --> 50:05.690]  Yeah, just keep her popped.
[50:07.210 --> 50:07.930]  Apprehended Alyssa.
[50:09.070 --> 50:09.550]  I don't know.
[50:09.550 --> 50:11.130]  I believe that's Joey Lauren Adams' character.
[50:11.210 --> 50:11.930]  I think so.
[50:12.030 --> 50:12.270]  Yeah.
[50:13.090 --> 50:14.030]  Is she stealing?
[50:14.130 --> 50:14.670]  I don't remember.
[50:15.050 --> 50:15.410]  Depressed...
[50:15.410 --> 50:16.390]  It's like little finger traps.
[50:17.490 --> 50:18.210]  Depressed Dante.
[50:19.150 --> 50:19.350]  Okay.
[50:19.450 --> 50:19.910]  Well, yeah.
[50:20.010 --> 50:21.390]  He's not even supposed to be here today.
[50:21.390 --> 50:22.190]  I thought it was a parallel.
[50:22.310 --> 50:23.430]  I think it's just a sticker.
[50:23.890 --> 50:24.330]  That's cool.
[50:24.470 --> 50:25.250]  Let's leave it, too, though.
[50:27.230 --> 50:27.790]  Missy Hicks.
[50:28.270 --> 50:30.390]  Oh, and then we got another chocolate-covered Carl.
[50:31.150 --> 50:32.090]  We got three more packs.
[50:32.150 --> 50:32.990]  Here's what we're going to do with these.
[50:33.050 --> 50:33.170]  Yeah.
[50:33.450 --> 50:34.630]  So Eric doesn't blow his brains out.
[50:34.710 --> 50:34.830]  Yeah.
[50:34.950 --> 50:35.630]  Put them in the pack sack.
[50:35.710 --> 50:36.070]  Thank you.
[50:36.170 --> 50:37.550]  Because you've got to feed the pack sack.
[50:37.650 --> 50:37.930]  Yay.
[50:38.150 --> 50:41.450]  And because I'm feeding it, I'm going to pull three packs out.
[50:41.630 --> 50:41.910]  Wow.
[50:44.510 --> 50:45.950]  Oh, wow.
[50:46.150 --> 50:48.210]  Oh, we might have got some stuff here.
[50:48.330 --> 50:48.610]  Okay.
[50:48.770 --> 50:49.530]  Let's see what we got.
[50:49.590 --> 50:50.150]  This is great.
[50:50.310 --> 50:51.250]  This is what the show is about.
[50:51.250 --> 50:52.150]  Opening cards.
[50:52.310 --> 50:52.730]  Oh, shit.
[50:52.770 --> 50:54.370]  We got some real cards here.
[50:54.390 --> 50:54.610]  Okay.
[50:55.070 --> 50:57.410]  These were put into the pack sack not too long ago.
[50:57.490 --> 50:57.630]  All right.
[50:57.650 --> 50:58.110]  We got...
[50:58.110 --> 50:58.810]  See, they all come...
[50:58.810 --> 50:58.950]  First of all...
[50:58.950 --> 50:59.730]  It comes out.
[50:59.850 --> 51:00.270]  You feed it.
[51:00.490 --> 51:01.070]  Bring it out straight.
[51:02.350 --> 51:03.070]  1990 Tops.
[51:03.190 --> 51:06.550]  Of course, we're going for our man Don Zimmer.
[51:06.690 --> 51:06.970]  Mm-hmm.
[51:07.230 --> 51:07.770]  Let's give it a shot.
[51:07.790 --> 51:09.470]  Wouldn't be mad at a King Griffey Jr., but...
[51:09.470 --> 51:09.670]  Mm-hmm.
[51:10.050 --> 51:10.710]  Dave Winfield.
[51:11.010 --> 51:11.510]  All right.
[51:12.210 --> 51:12.930]  Eric Plunk.
[51:13.130 --> 51:13.330]  Oh.
[51:14.290 --> 51:14.990]  Matt Young.
[51:15.090 --> 51:15.810]  Names of sounds.
[51:16.190 --> 51:16.370]  Yeah.
[51:16.370 --> 51:18.250]  What is it when your name sounds like the thing it is?
[51:18.790 --> 51:19.390]  Does anyone know?
[51:19.490 --> 51:19.870]  That's a thing.
[51:19.950 --> 51:20.390]  It's like a word.
[51:20.470 --> 51:21.210]  I'm going to pee it.
[51:21.410 --> 51:22.210]  I'm going to pee it.
[51:22.430 --> 51:23.030]  I'm going to pee it.
[51:23.170 --> 51:23.470]  I'm not going to pee it.
[51:23.470 --> 51:24.050]  Matt Young.
[51:25.490 --> 51:25.850]  Uh...
[51:26.570 --> 51:27.290]  Atlee Hamaker.
[51:27.650 --> 51:27.970]  Oh.
[51:28.130 --> 51:28.870]  I don't know what's going on there.
[51:30.170 --> 51:30.890]  Bob McClure.
[51:31.110 --> 51:31.330]  Mm.
[51:33.410 --> 51:34.130]  Rick Honeycutt.
[51:34.590 --> 51:35.250]  Is that food?
[51:35.530 --> 51:36.070]  Honeycutt ham.
[51:36.390 --> 51:36.530]  Oh.
[51:36.530 --> 51:37.870]  Is it on the...
[51:37.870 --> 51:38.790]  It's honey baked ham.
[51:38.970 --> 51:40.230]  Oh, it is honey baked ham.
[51:40.390 --> 51:41.730]  You can't honey cut a ham.
[51:42.170 --> 51:42.630]  You can try.
[51:42.770 --> 51:42.870]  It does.
[51:42.870 --> 51:43.750]  I don't think it makes it.
[51:43.930 --> 51:44.150]  Okay.
[51:44.330 --> 51:44.570]  Okay.
[51:44.790 --> 51:46.190]  Todd Stottlemyre.
[51:46.350 --> 51:46.670]  Mm-hmm.
[51:48.050 --> 51:48.470]  Uh...
[51:48.470 --> 51:48.750]  Here we go.
[51:48.970 --> 51:49.790]  Greg Litton.
[51:49.930 --> 51:50.190]  Mm-hmm.
[51:50.790 --> 51:51.630]  We got a manager card.
[51:51.810 --> 51:52.330]  We got a manager card.
[51:52.430 --> 51:53.390]  I didn't see who it is, but...
[51:53.390 --> 51:54.470]  Mike Jackson.
[51:54.750 --> 51:55.050]  Okay.
[51:56.190 --> 51:57.030]  Scott Geralt.
[51:57.470 --> 51:57.830]  Fart.
[51:58.230 --> 51:58.650]  Fart.
[52:01.710 --> 52:02.550]  Kevin Gross.
[52:02.910 --> 52:03.310]  Ew.
[52:03.490 --> 52:03.910]  Yuck.
[52:05.050 --> 52:07.410]  Let me do a name of all insult team.
[52:07.410 --> 52:07.690]  Gross.
[52:08.670 --> 52:10.010]  Tony La Russa manager.
[52:10.250 --> 52:11.290]  That wasn't a...
[52:11.290 --> 52:12.630]  Gotta love Tony La Russa, though.
[52:12.850 --> 52:13.230]  Do you?
[52:13.730 --> 52:14.610]  As a White Sox fan?
[52:15.270 --> 52:16.570]  I love Tony La Russa.
[52:16.630 --> 52:16.650]  The answer is...
[52:17.250 --> 52:17.450]  Okay.
[52:17.790 --> 52:18.190]  Yeah.
[52:18.290 --> 52:18.630]  Uh-huh.
[52:18.810 --> 52:19.510]  And I like the...
[52:19.510 --> 52:19.670]  What was he?
[52:19.770 --> 52:20.710]  Cardinals coach, as well?
[52:20.810 --> 52:20.910]  Cardinals coach, yeah.
[52:20.910 --> 52:21.630]  I liked him as a Cardinals coach.
[52:22.710 --> 52:23.510]  Juan Samuel.
[52:24.910 --> 52:26.210]  Ooh, Dave Henderson.
[52:26.590 --> 52:27.250]  Love Dave Henderson.
[52:27.530 --> 52:28.310]  I want another...
[52:28.310 --> 52:28.830]  Damn.
[52:29.110 --> 52:29.690]  Jim Lefaber.
[52:30.370 --> 52:31.750]  Two managers, no Zims.
[52:31.830 --> 52:32.670]  We're close, though.
[52:32.890 --> 52:33.130]  Yep.
[52:33.230 --> 52:33.550]  Woof.
[52:34.030 --> 52:35.770]  All right, should we open up a...
[52:35.770 --> 52:36.270]  Yeah.
[52:36.270 --> 52:36.690]  Let's do it.
[52:37.050 --> 52:38.110]  We got eight minutes left.
[52:38.470 --> 52:39.550]  Now, this is for you.
[52:39.990 --> 52:40.390]  Me?
[52:40.730 --> 52:41.290]  Oh, no.
[52:41.330 --> 52:42.090]  It's select.
[52:42.530 --> 52:42.950]  Yeah, sorry.
[52:43.210 --> 52:44.610]  Prism is the one that has the...
[52:45.550 --> 52:46.030]  Sorry.
[52:47.170 --> 52:48.130]  Angela Hill.
[52:48.350 --> 52:48.510]  Okay.
[52:49.890 --> 52:50.850]  Amanda Nunes.
[52:50.910 --> 52:52.050]  Oh, we saw her fight.
[52:52.050 --> 52:52.770]  We saw her fight recently.
[52:52.990 --> 52:53.230]  Good.
[52:53.630 --> 52:54.550]  John Jones.
[52:54.630 --> 52:56.030]  Saw him fight recently, too.
[52:56.270 --> 52:57.010]  Bones himself.
[52:57.710 --> 52:59.270]  And Aljamain Sterling.
[52:59.390 --> 53:00.810]  Green, white, and purple parallel.
[53:01.150 --> 53:01.790]  We'll save that.
[53:01.830 --> 53:02.150]  Okay.
[53:02.770 --> 53:03.250]  Okay.
[53:03.350 --> 53:04.630]  Did you see that UFC thing?
[53:04.670 --> 53:05.410]  Did I send it to you?
[53:05.470 --> 53:07.450]  I think it's a TikTok that was like...
[53:08.110 --> 53:14.590]  You go to this huge screen, and then it's a camera inside the cage, and it's standing
[53:14.590 --> 53:19.930]  stationary, and it's filming the whole cage, and you go and you watch the fight.
[53:20.030 --> 53:20.530]  That way.
[53:20.770 --> 53:21.030]  Yeah.
[53:21.230 --> 53:27.050]  It's cute, and you're watching this gigantic IMAX-looking screen, and it's like you're
[53:27.050 --> 53:27.430]  there.
[53:27.810 --> 53:28.690]  They move around.
[53:28.930 --> 53:29.790]  Camera's totally static.
[53:29.910 --> 53:31.110]  It's like you're there just watching it.
[53:31.110 --> 53:31.550]  Where is it?
[53:31.650 --> 53:32.190]  I don't remember.
[53:32.290 --> 53:32.970]  I think it's like Colorado.
[53:33.230 --> 53:33.510]  Oh, okay.
[53:33.510 --> 53:34.470]  It was fucking cool.
[53:34.570 --> 53:35.670]  I really want to go to it.
[53:35.710 --> 53:36.430]  It looks sick.
[53:36.790 --> 53:38.130]  Sir Loras Terrell.
[53:39.830 --> 53:40.030]  Who?
[53:40.170 --> 53:41.250]  Brienne of Tarth.
[53:41.330 --> 53:42.050]  You know Sir Loras.
[53:42.050 --> 53:42.890]  Yeah, you know Sir Loras.
[53:43.150 --> 53:43.230]  Yeah.
[53:43.870 --> 53:45.910]  Brienne of Tarth.
[53:47.570 --> 53:49.310]  Battle of the Bastards.
[53:49.770 --> 53:52.150]  That's a lady and her dragon horse.
[53:52.290 --> 53:52.970]  That's the lizard.
[53:53.590 --> 53:54.690]  Sir Jorah Mormont.
[53:54.930 --> 53:55.590]  It's the creature.
[53:55.770 --> 53:57.090]  Dude, fucking...
[53:57.090 --> 54:00.890]  Honestly, like, somebody take out a restraining order on him.
[54:02.670 --> 54:03.630]  Jesus Christ, man.
[54:03.630 --> 54:04.030]  I'm back!
[54:04.370 --> 54:04.730]  Okay, cool.
[54:04.730 --> 54:05.170]  Leave her alone.
[54:05.350 --> 54:05.450]  Great.
[54:05.690 --> 54:06.070]  Osha.
[54:07.230 --> 54:07.790]  Greyjoy.
[54:07.970 --> 54:08.470]  Violation.
[54:09.530 --> 54:10.090]  Interesting.
[54:10.750 --> 54:11.070]  Asha.
[54:11.070 --> 54:14.050]  And then, uh, the Night King.
[54:14.330 --> 54:14.870]  Ooh, spooky.
[54:15.950 --> 54:17.350]  Nothing can stop him.
[54:19.610 --> 54:19.930]  Spooky.
[54:20.850 --> 54:23.390]  Okay, that gives us about seven minutes left.
[54:23.510 --> 54:25.150]  Let's fuck around with...
[54:25.770 --> 54:26.190]  What do you got?
[54:26.250 --> 54:26.490]  What do you got?
[54:26.550 --> 54:27.210]  Oh, do you know what?
[54:27.250 --> 54:27.950]  I have some stuff.
[54:28.070 --> 54:28.470]  What do you have?
[54:28.470 --> 54:29.090]  I do have some stuff.
[54:29.190 --> 54:34.010]  I went to Michigan, and when I was in Michigan, I bought a couple packs in a tiny little town
[54:34.010 --> 54:35.090]  we went to called...
[54:35.090 --> 54:35.430]  Marine City.
[54:35.490 --> 54:36.190]  Marine City.
[54:36.310 --> 54:37.050]  It was adorable.
[54:37.050 --> 54:37.450]  Okay.
[54:37.790 --> 54:42.970]  And there, I was able to get some old baseball, and...
[54:46.590 --> 54:47.910]  So, uh, I'm excited about this.
[54:47.970 --> 54:50.210]  Here's NBA 9192 Basketball.
[54:50.970 --> 54:51.830]  This is the upper deck.
[54:53.270 --> 54:54.410]  These are cool-looking cards.
[54:54.570 --> 54:57.270]  There won't be any value or anything in here, but maybe there'll be some funny names.
[54:58.230 --> 55:02.150]  Uh, man, I spent so much of my yard-cutting money on these cards, and now here I am...
[55:03.090 --> 55:04.970]  25 years later, still buying them.
[55:04.970 --> 55:06.650]  Uh, Michael Adams.
[55:07.690 --> 55:08.610]  Dennis Scott.
[55:09.690 --> 55:12.030]  Oh, sweet Eric Murdoch.
[55:13.150 --> 55:14.070]  Ricky Green.
[55:15.610 --> 55:18.610]  Kevin Edwards is a who's who of who I don't remember from NBA.
[55:19.670 --> 55:20.730]  Uh, Willie Anderson.
[55:20.870 --> 55:21.930]  What year was this, 9192?
[55:22.170 --> 55:23.970]  9192. Sam Vincent. Everybody knows Sam Vincent.
[55:24.650 --> 55:25.730]  Uh, Mo Cheeks.
[55:26.030 --> 55:27.170]  Hey, there's Mo Cheeks.
[55:27.350 --> 55:28.770]  Brad Lohaus. I remember Brad Lohaus.
[55:29.470 --> 55:31.030]  Uh, Del Curry.
[55:31.610 --> 55:32.070]  Squat.
[55:32.070 --> 55:35.730]  That guy made the best shooter of all time.
[55:36.270 --> 55:36.710]  Uh...
[55:36.710 --> 55:37.490]  Steph Curry.
[55:37.690 --> 55:39.530]  Is he in the food category?
[55:39.670 --> 55:40.270]  Yeah, he would be.
[55:40.290 --> 55:40.510]  Oh, yeah.
[55:40.930 --> 55:41.670]  Papa Curry.
[55:41.790 --> 55:42.530]  Michael Del Curry.
[55:43.370 --> 55:46.490]  Uh, Mike Geminski, and then John Stockton.
[55:46.650 --> 55:47.010]  Hey.
[55:47.210 --> 55:49.250]  Uh, what a way to...
[55:49.250 --> 55:54.430]  You wanna be an athlete with an unimpeachable career, but you still want people to hate you?
[55:54.470 --> 55:56.970]  You want people just to go like, oh, I'm never voting for that fucking guy.
[55:56.970 --> 56:03.570]  You wanna go, like, I love him as an NBA player, but as a human post-NBA, not so much.
[56:03.950 --> 56:05.250]  Just do what John Stockton's done.
[56:05.250 --> 56:05.810]  What did he do?
[56:06.250 --> 56:08.130]  Uh, he's a big anti-vaxxer.
[56:08.730 --> 56:09.850]  He has a lot to say.
[56:09.890 --> 56:10.590]  He's a lot...
[56:10.590 --> 56:11.870]  He's got a lot...
[56:11.870 --> 56:15.430]  He's sort of got a lot of Pat Sajak type stuff to say, where you're like...
[56:15.430 --> 56:16.570]  There's no need to say it.
[56:17.210 --> 56:17.930]  Here's something I'm gonna open.
[56:18.570 --> 56:19.490]  I don't know what this is.
[56:19.730 --> 56:20.410]  Lord of the Rings.
[56:21.050 --> 56:21.410]  Magic.
[56:22.210 --> 56:23.410]  Magic the Gathering.
[56:23.510 --> 56:24.870]  I think somebody gave this to me.
[56:24.870 --> 56:27.370]  I can't remember if it was Ben or somebody else gave this to me.
[56:27.930 --> 56:28.450]  Um, recently.
[56:28.610 --> 56:29.610]  I just found it in my closet.
[56:29.910 --> 56:31.270]  Somebody's gonna care about these, I'm sure.
[56:31.730 --> 56:33.850]  It's Magic and Lord of the Rings together?
[56:33.870 --> 56:37.170]  I think it's the one where you can get the two million dollar one ring card.
[56:37.230 --> 56:38.190]  Okay, that's what...
[56:38.190 --> 56:40.230]  But that's already been pulled, so...
[56:40.230 --> 56:41.270]  Didn't Post Malone pull it?
[56:42.410 --> 56:44.510]  He got a big Magic card recently.
[56:44.670 --> 56:46.290]  Here's a Ballistic Boulder, I guess.
[56:46.510 --> 56:48.070]  Fuck, I'm gonna be useless with this.
[56:48.890 --> 56:49.950]  Uh, hit...
[56:50.650 --> 56:51.170]  Hit...
[56:51.170 --> 56:53.090]  Hithlain Knots.
[56:53.910 --> 56:55.170]  Morgil Knife Wound.
[56:55.250 --> 56:57.130]  Let us know if any of this is worth anything, because I'll never fucking know.
[56:57.130 --> 56:58.330]  This is Morgil Knife Wound.
[56:58.670 --> 57:01.430]  Uh, Erebor Flamesmith.
[57:01.490 --> 57:02.170]  These suck.
[57:02.610 --> 57:04.510]  The Soothing of Smeagol.
[57:05.490 --> 57:07.090]  Uh, it was a bitter downfall.
[57:07.370 --> 57:07.650]  Aw.
[57:07.870 --> 57:10.010]  Aw, Samwise the...
[57:10.690 --> 57:12.410]  Stealther to the...
[57:13.410 --> 57:13.930]  Uh...
[57:13.930 --> 57:15.230]  Oh, you guys are gonna get a Swamp card.
[57:15.550 --> 57:16.890]  Hey, Swamp!
[57:17.730 --> 57:19.210]  One ring to rule them all.
[57:20.590 --> 57:21.690]  Press the enemy.
[57:21.870 --> 57:22.490]  They were all of them.
[57:22.730 --> 57:24.750]  I don't think any of these are worth $2,000,000.
[57:24.990 --> 57:27.490]  Uh, Lobelia, Defender of the Bag End.
[57:29.390 --> 57:30.030]  Frodo Baggins.
[57:30.290 --> 57:31.170]  Oh, that's a Defender.
[57:31.250 --> 57:32.430]  Uh, Rivendell.
[57:33.190 --> 57:34.910]  Do you know any of this stuff from Lord of the Rings?
[57:34.950 --> 57:35.750]  I don't know Lord of the Rings.
[57:35.830 --> 57:39.170]  I know a lot of... I don't know some of these people, but I know a lot of the...
[57:39.170 --> 57:39.790]  Yeah. The references and stuff.
[57:39.790 --> 57:42.090]  I know Rivendell, I know, uh...
[57:42.090 --> 57:42.470]  Swamp.
[57:42.650 --> 57:47.290]  I don't know Lobelia, but yeah, clearly I know...
[57:47.290 --> 57:48.010]  Frodo, I know Swamp.
[57:48.930 --> 57:52.150]  I know Halflings from D&D.
[57:52.730 --> 57:53.250]  Oliphant.
[57:53.570 --> 57:54.310]  That's cool.
[57:55.710 --> 57:58.310]  That's how you say Timothy Oliphant.
[57:58.910 --> 58:01.070]  Like, you're supposed to say his name like Elephant.
[58:01.510 --> 58:03.490]  His name is Timothy Oliphant.
[58:04.130 --> 58:04.510]  Oliphant.
[58:04.570 --> 58:04.910]  Isn't that weird?
[58:05.290 --> 58:07.490]  Here's the Shire, and it's like...
[58:07.490 --> 58:09.130]  I don't know if it's because it's...
[58:09.130 --> 58:09.610]  Shimmershire.
[58:10.930 --> 58:12.350]  I don't know if there's...
[58:12.350 --> 58:13.330]  Anyway, there you go.
[58:13.330 --> 58:15.150]  Let us know if any of that was anything.
[58:15.290 --> 58:15.930]  We have two minutes.
[58:16.590 --> 58:18.030]  Let's open up this. I bought this today.
[58:19.370 --> 58:22.530]  I've never bought one of these before, but I wanted to do something a little special for today.
[58:22.850 --> 58:25.130]  So I bought Dugout Dreams, whatever the fuck they are.
[58:25.450 --> 58:25.790]  $100.
[58:26.350 --> 58:27.350]  You get one baseball.
[58:28.890 --> 58:29.890]  One autographed baseball.
[58:30.270 --> 58:31.650]  Well, I wanted to do something special for today.
[58:32.050 --> 58:33.010]  It could be Mike Trout.
[58:33.150 --> 58:34.210]  It could be Aaron Judge.
[58:34.410 --> 58:37.750]  It could be Mickey Mantle or William McCovey or Ernie Banks
[58:37.750 --> 58:39.450]  or Reggie Jackson or Harmon Killebrew
[58:39.450 --> 58:41.230]  or Hank Aaron or Frank Robinson
[58:41.230 --> 58:43.250]  or Eddie Matthews or Willie Mays or Ted Williams
[58:43.250 --> 58:44.630]  or Mike Schmidt or Bryce Harper
[58:45.310 --> 58:46.250]  $100, huh?
[58:46.270 --> 58:48.430]  David Ortiz. There's a lot of people it could be.
[58:49.310 --> 58:50.270]  Vlad Jr.
[58:50.450 --> 58:53.610]  Roger Clemens, Pete Alonzo, Nolan Renato, Paul Goldschmidt.
[58:53.610 --> 58:54.550]  So what are you hoping for?
[58:54.710 --> 58:56.790]  What are you gonna wish for?
[58:56.850 --> 58:58.790]  I'm wishing for...
[58:59.710 --> 59:01.250]  Don Zimmer would be amazing.
[59:01.350 --> 59:02.410]  We're gonna use Angela Lansbury.
[59:02.810 --> 59:04.710]  We have some Lansbury money in this guy.
[59:05.150 --> 59:07.370]  I'm hoping for a Shohei Otani
[59:07.370 --> 59:08.990]  or a Mickey Mantle.
[59:08.990 --> 59:09.570]  That's what we want.
[59:10.610 --> 59:11.430]  Shohei or Mickey?
[59:13.070 --> 59:15.610]  We'll probably get Bip Roberts.
[59:16.330 --> 59:17.370]  Oh, I want Bip Roberts.
[59:17.470 --> 59:18.030]  That's cool.
[59:19.610 --> 59:20.410]  Here we go.
[59:21.170 --> 59:21.730]  Oh boy.
[59:23.150 --> 59:24.390]  I don't know.
[59:28.010 --> 59:28.890]  It's so scary.
[59:29.010 --> 59:29.590]  What is it?
[59:30.530 --> 59:31.530]  Does it tell you?
[59:32.530 --> 59:34.030]  Why are you just touching it?
[59:35.510 --> 59:37.790]  There's anything in it that tells you who signed it?
[59:37.830 --> 59:38.550]  Oh boy.
[59:41.390 --> 59:42.130]  Julio...
[59:42.130 --> 59:43.270]  Is it Ryan MVP?
[59:43.770 --> 59:45.330]  Three-time All-Star,
[59:45.970 --> 59:47.550]  two-time AL MVP,
[59:48.430 --> 59:51.050]  six-time Silver Slugger Award winner,
[59:51.670 --> 59:53.810]  two-time AL Home Run Leader,
[59:54.290 --> 59:56.450]  1998 AL RBI Leader,
[59:56.890 --> 59:58.270]  Texas Rangers
[59:58.270 --> 59:59.850]  Hall of Fame
[59:59.850 --> 01:00:01.370]  Juan Gonzalez.
[01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:02.250]  Juan Gonzalez?
[01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:04.190]  That might be a decent...
[01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.110]  That's a decent one.
[01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:06.230]  I'll take a Juan Gonzalez.
[01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:07.250]  That's pretty cool.
[01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:09.590]  We are now the official owners of a wall.
[01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:12.610]  He signed it. Two-time AL MVP,
[01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:13.550]  Juan Gonzalez.
[01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:15.750]  Juan Gonzalez!
[01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.950]  There you go.
[01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:19.950]  Maybe we'll give this away someday in a giveaway.
[01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:20.730]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:23.290]  That's pretty...
[01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:25.370]  I don't know that I'd ever do that again.
[01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:26.190]  That makes me so nervous.
[01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:27.390]  Yeah, it was pretty nervous.
[01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:31.470]  They call it gambling.
[01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:34.510]  What did you think of the first episode
[01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:36.110]  of the Break Show, now a weekly show,
[01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:38.250]  every Monday at 4 p.m. Central Time,
[01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:39.830]  only on Rooster Teeth and the
[01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:42.170]  Face YouTube channel. Can I be honest with you?
[01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:44.530]  I know we've done this a bunch of times
[01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:45.890]  already, probably 20 times.
[01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:47.830]  It felt different. Really?
[01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:50.090]  In a good way. I thought it felt better.
[01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:52.330]  It feels like a start.
[01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:53.530]  Oh, okay.
[01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:56.050]  What are some things that you look forward to
[01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:58.670]  for next week? I'm looking forward to
[01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:00.230]  most in week two
[01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:02.170]  when we get to add to the collections
[01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:04.290]  that we created today. We'll come up with new collections
[01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:05.570]  in week two, invariably.
[01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:08.010]  I'm excited about
[01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:09.870]  watching the ones we have grow.
[01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:12.090]  Like, name is a food.
[01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:13.210]  What the fuck?
[01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.490]  Name is a place. Name is a burp.
[01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:17.290]  Name is an instrument.
[01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:19.610]  I have some written down.
[01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:20.790]  We got a cool hand, Luca.
[01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:24.070]  But next week, special
[01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:26.270]  guest star Gustavo
[01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:27.650]  Cirolla will be here.
[01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:30.270]  He'll be opening up his insane amount of
[01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.410]  cards that he's had in a storage unit
[01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:33.350]  for years and years.
[01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:36.390]  We did it. The first episode
[01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:37.970]  of The Break Show. This was so much fun.
[01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:40.310]  We have a set that we're going to be able to add
[01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:42.350]  stuff to. We have a table that you don't have to
[01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:44.670]  tear down every fucking time we do this show.
[01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:46.490]  This is great. This is a lot of fun.
[01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:48.050]  I'm really jazzed. I'm really, really, really jazzed.
[01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:49.870]  Hopefully you enjoyed it. Let us know
[01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:52.310]  that you did. If you didn't enjoy it,
[01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:54.250]  you can tell your mom or your
[01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:56.630]  therapist or a friend at school, but we don't necessarily have to know that.
[01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:58.470]  And hopefully we'll
[01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:00.590]  see you next week. And if you didn't get a chance to watch this,
[01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:02.030]  then you're not listening to me say this, but
[01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:04.450]  maybe through osmosis, you can tune in on
[01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:06.710]  Thursdays on RT for First
[01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:08.470]  or Fridays on YouTube. There you go.
[01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:10.390]  Alright, thanks guys. Listen to
[01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:12.110]  F*** Face, the podcast. Bye-bye.
