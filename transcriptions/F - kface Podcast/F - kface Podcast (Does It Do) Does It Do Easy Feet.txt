[00:00.000 --> 00:06.500]  Hello and welcome to Does It Do, the hot new show from Unifarm.
[00:06.940 --> 00:09.760]  Unifarm, combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm.
[00:10.100 --> 00:13.720]  Unifarm, where we, Gavin and I, my name is Geoff, this is Gavin,
[00:13.920 --> 00:18.760]  we each week take a look at the products that you see on television,
[00:19.180 --> 00:23.560]  on the internet, on social media, that seem maybe a little too good to be true.
[00:23.760 --> 00:27.540]  We take a look at them and we determine what we like to call affectionately
[00:27.540 --> 00:36.400]  the woof, the WWH, the what, the why, and the how does it do what it says it does.
[00:36.540 --> 00:40.960]  Let's get right to it. This week, Gavin, our product is the Easy Feet.
[00:41.040 --> 00:44.340]  The purpose of the Easy Foot, as it is illustrated here,
[00:44.580 --> 00:47.500]  is to clean, exfoliate, and massage your foot.
[00:47.720 --> 00:50.760]  But Geoff, I hate bending.
[00:51.020 --> 00:56.780]  Well, you have an arthritic back, I know, and that's a problem for a man such as yourself
[00:56.780 --> 00:58.200]  who needs to clean his feet.
[00:58.520 --> 01:01.600]  Uh, okay, so we're gonna need to make, uh, the first thing we need is dirty feet.
[01:02.760 --> 01:03.660]  You got some of them?
[01:04.140 --> 01:05.140]  No, but I'll make one.
[01:05.300 --> 01:09.560]  All right, I'm gonna put my foot, we've got, we got some, uh, pre-made mud and dirt.
[01:10.860 --> 01:11.760]  That's really gross.
[01:14.920 --> 01:16.500]  Uh, it's the worst. It's the worst.
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.640]  Oh, I have such dirty feet. What can I do?
[01:21.300 --> 01:23.580]  Oh, my back hurts. I don't want to bend over.
[01:23.740 --> 01:25.120]  But my feet are so dirty.
[01:25.480 --> 01:26.820]  I guess I'll have to...
[01:26.820 --> 01:29.760]  Oh, I know, I'll try the hazy feet.
[01:30.220 --> 01:31.500]  Oh, yeah.
[01:32.260 --> 01:33.860]  No, don't slide the thing.
[01:34.760 --> 01:39.740]  Oh, suction, fucker. It's not, it's not suctioning super well.
[01:40.600 --> 01:43.160]  Which makes it hard to, oh yeah, put a little...
[01:43.700 --> 01:45.140]  Well, you need some, some wet.
[01:45.600 --> 01:47.260]  Yeah, thanks, that's good, that's good.
[01:48.560 --> 01:50.140]  All right, here's the problem.
[01:50.920 --> 01:54.080]  Yes, the, right away, the suction cups sort of work.
[01:54.080 --> 01:55.600]  But they work against themselves, too.
[01:55.680 --> 01:57.080]  Like, I'm not pulling this thing up.
[01:57.980 --> 02:02.760]  But if I try to scrub, they slide.
[02:03.640 --> 02:04.320]  That's a problem.
[02:04.760 --> 02:05.800]  That's a strike against this thing.
[02:05.880 --> 02:06.280]  I don't know.
[02:09.940 --> 02:14.760]  Um, I'm not, I'm not jazzed about that.
[02:14.840 --> 02:17.420]  Let's see if, uh, we probably don't want to use these two for it.
[02:17.800 --> 02:19.620]  Have you seen this product on TV?
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.040]  Let's see what else it might do.
[02:27.200 --> 02:28.240]  Let's use a stunt foot.
[02:28.600 --> 02:28.920]  Okay.
[02:29.960 --> 02:31.260]  Maybe you're a sneakerhead.
[02:35.630 --> 02:37.270]  Here, maybe you're a sneakerhead.
[02:38.190 --> 02:39.530]  And you have dirty shoes.
[02:39.630 --> 02:43.110]  You're like, oh, I just paid a thousand dollars for these Rare Air Jordans, but they're dirty.
[02:45.550 --> 02:47.130]  I don't know whose foot's real.
[02:53.370 --> 02:54.370]  I don't think it's any cleaner.
[02:55.050 --> 02:56.190]  And I had to bend over to do it.
[02:56.210 --> 02:56.550]  That's right.
[02:57.110 --> 02:59.250]  Uh, yeah, I don't think it works worth a damn.
[02:59.790 --> 03:03.530]  Uh, so let's determine, does it do...
[03:03.530 --> 03:04.790]  Oh no, the stone!
[03:05.170 --> 03:06.350]  Does it do something else?
[03:07.030 --> 03:08.770]  The pumice stone got pummeled.
[03:08.810 --> 03:09.110]  Okay.
[03:09.650 --> 03:10.150]  All right.
[03:10.250 --> 03:11.450]  So clearly it doesn't do...
[03:12.830 --> 03:17.190]  But before we throw it in the pile of don't, we're going to find out if it does something else.
[03:17.590 --> 03:19.870]  Maybe it works as a baby cleaner.
[03:20.310 --> 03:21.450]  A lot of people have babies.
[03:23.770 --> 03:25.690]  I'll be on the dirt and you be on the clean.
[03:25.790 --> 03:26.690]  All right, you dirt the baby.
[03:26.790 --> 03:27.470]  I'll clean the baby.
[03:31.210 --> 03:32.130]  Yeah, get it, get it.
[03:32.210 --> 03:32.770]  Babies get dirty.
[03:32.770 --> 03:33.410]  Babies get messy.
[03:33.810 --> 03:36.370]  They don't understand cleanliness or personal responsibilities.
[03:36.550 --> 03:37.090]  They don't know.
[03:37.370 --> 03:39.230]  They don't know not to roll around in the mud.
[03:39.730 --> 03:40.750]  Filthy little creatures.
[03:41.750 --> 03:42.290]  There you go.
[03:42.370 --> 03:42.830]  Get it in there.
[03:43.050 --> 03:43.630]  Get the baby in.
[03:43.970 --> 03:44.130]  Yeah.
[03:44.290 --> 03:44.650]  Okay.
[03:45.110 --> 03:46.050]  Let's see if we can get...
[03:47.030 --> 03:48.450]  Oh, little Gabby Jr.
[03:48.910 --> 03:50.290]  Meg is going to be so disappointed.
[03:50.710 --> 03:53.690]  You took him to the park and he came home covered in mud.
[03:54.010 --> 03:55.250]  Every time, Gavin.
[03:55.350 --> 03:57.470]  This is why I didn't want to have kids with you, she says.
[03:58.010 --> 03:58.510]  Well, all right.
[03:58.550 --> 04:00.970]  Let's uh, let's see if we can clean the babe up.
[04:00.970 --> 04:01.290]  God.
[04:02.350 --> 04:02.790]  Yeah.
[04:03.330 --> 04:04.390]  Can it go all the way through?
[04:04.990 --> 04:09.050]  It'll, it'll clean a small baby all the way through.
[04:09.510 --> 04:13.570]  But you're, you're, you're putting a lot of pressure on the cranium.
[04:13.770 --> 04:14.470]  I wouldn't do it.
[04:15.090 --> 04:16.910]  And it didn't clean the diaper at all.
[04:17.310 --> 04:17.650]  Okay.
[04:17.970 --> 04:18.630]  Diaper looks rough.
[04:18.950 --> 04:21.030]  So I'm gonna say it doesn't clean a baby particularly well.
[04:21.250 --> 04:22.390]  What else can this thing do?
[04:23.050 --> 04:23.910]  It's got a pumice stone.
[04:25.090 --> 04:29.510]  It's for uh, supposedly it's for, you know,
[04:29.510 --> 04:31.650]  cleaning all the dead skin and stuff off your feet.
[04:33.090 --> 04:33.950]  Does it great.
[04:38.250 --> 04:40.530]  This is a, is this the unused one?
[04:40.630 --> 04:41.390]  Yeah, this is unused.
[04:41.490 --> 04:41.710]  You're good.
[04:42.030 --> 04:42.490]  This is clean.
[04:43.530 --> 04:44.550]  This is a hard cheese too.
[04:44.650 --> 04:47.150]  So it should, it doesn't, it doesn't do.
[04:48.270 --> 04:48.950]  That's a no.
[04:50.770 --> 04:51.570]  You know what it does?
[04:52.150 --> 04:56.750]  You know, it kind of looks like though, kind of, kind of looks like a little fish mouth.
[04:56.850 --> 04:57.550]  A little fish monster.
[04:57.770 --> 04:57.930]  Yeah.
[04:58.050 --> 05:01.850]  What if maybe, I always keep these in my pocket just in case.
[05:03.090 --> 05:04.050]  Let's get some tape.
[05:05.430 --> 05:06.430]  Bear with me here, Gavin.
[05:06.490 --> 05:07.130]  I have an idea.
[05:12.220 --> 05:18.560]  What if instead of a foot massage, a foot cleaner, it's a little robot googly eyed mouth man.
[05:18.800 --> 05:21.000]  And you're like, Hey, the kid's like, I don't want dinner, mommy.
[05:21.160 --> 05:21.960]  I don't want dinner, dad.
[05:22.000 --> 05:23.280]  And dad's like, eat your damn dinner.
[05:23.360 --> 05:24.620]  And the kid's like, no, I want the airplane.
[05:24.720 --> 05:26.540]  And dad's like, I'm so sick of the goddamn airplane.
[05:26.640 --> 05:28.060]  I've been in an airplane for two fucking years.
[05:28.880 --> 05:29.480]  Fuck off.
[05:29.620 --> 05:30.180]  Just eat your food.
[05:30.420 --> 05:34.220]  Instead, maybe you put it here, put it up to the kid's mouth like this and go feed the fishy,
[05:34.540 --> 05:35.000]  feed the fishy.
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.750]  And then you go like, oh, yeah.
[05:41.710 --> 05:42.210]  All right.
[05:42.250 --> 05:42.670]  Hit me out.
[05:43.810 --> 05:44.990]  You know, the sewing machine.
[05:45.210 --> 05:45.510]  I do.
[05:46.410 --> 05:48.490]  Imagine sewing machine training.
[05:48.730 --> 05:49.110]  Uh huh.
[05:49.230 --> 05:49.470]  Right.
[05:49.630 --> 05:53.750]  We'll both get a pair of these and we'll see who wins the race.
[05:54.610 --> 05:54.890]  Okay.
[05:55.090 --> 05:55.770]  What do you mean?
[05:55.850 --> 05:56.630]  Who wins the race?
[05:56.690 --> 05:57.630]  We got to run over there.
[05:58.770 --> 05:59.930]  I only have one.
[06:00.730 --> 06:01.490]  That's what there's one there.
[06:04.690 --> 06:06.070]  I need some moisture.
[06:06.070 --> 06:06.430]  I think.
[06:08.190 --> 06:08.350]  All right.
[06:08.410 --> 06:08.710]  Hold on.
[06:09.110 --> 06:11.770]  You know, you could almost like Spider-Man up a building with one of these.
[06:12.430 --> 06:12.790]  Yeah.
[06:12.850 --> 06:15.390]  Do we have a glass wall?
[06:15.470 --> 06:15.710]  All right.
[06:18.490 --> 06:19.390]  It's not a low-bearing wall.
[06:19.470 --> 06:20.490]  We'll start here and we'll race.
[06:20.690 --> 06:21.010]  Okay.
[06:21.930 --> 06:22.830]  What are we determining?
[06:23.850 --> 06:27.170]  Well, it's just like, it's like strength training for little sprints for the sewing machine.
[06:27.410 --> 06:27.750]  Oh, okay.
[06:27.770 --> 06:28.030]  I see.
[06:28.090 --> 06:28.270]  Yeah.
[06:28.650 --> 06:30.170]  First one to that box.
[06:30.330 --> 06:30.610]  Okay.
[06:42.830 --> 06:44.010]  Yeah, but at what cost?
[06:44.150 --> 06:45.730]  I don't think it does that very well.
[06:47.110 --> 06:48.550]  I broke my ass.
[06:49.470 --> 06:53.930]  What is one more thing before we throw this in the pile?
[06:55.250 --> 06:55.750]  I feel like there's...
[06:56.770 --> 06:57.670]  How about this?
[06:58.370 --> 06:58.870]  How about this?
[06:58.910 --> 06:59.370]  This is my phone.
[06:59.570 --> 06:59.690]  Yeah.
[07:02.350 --> 07:03.230]  What if...
[07:11.910 --> 07:12.590]  Give me a call.
[07:22.550 --> 07:23.830]  Let me go to my favorites.
[07:23.990 --> 07:24.410]  Okay.
[07:42.040 --> 07:44.260]  I was hoping to make like a good, like a foot massager.
[07:44.580 --> 07:46.160]  The vibrating, but it's not, I didn't really feel it.
[07:47.020 --> 07:48.200]  I mean, I can kind of feel it.
[07:48.240 --> 07:48.400]  Yeah.
[07:50.660 --> 07:52.640]  Yeah, I can feel it, but it's not like...
[07:52.640 --> 07:52.820]  All right.
[07:52.840 --> 07:53.140]  Keep it up.
[07:53.200 --> 07:53.540]  Keep it up.
[08:05.230 --> 08:05.790]  All right.
[08:06.030 --> 08:08.450]  I'll call again.
[08:09.410 --> 08:09.790]  Yeah, yeah.
[08:09.850 --> 08:10.250]  Call again.
[08:14.500 --> 08:15.360]  Yeah, kind of.
[08:15.800 --> 08:16.280]  Kind of.
[08:16.280 --> 08:18.200]  Only if it's below...
[08:19.880 --> 08:21.300]  Nah, it doesn't really work as a massager.
[08:21.600 --> 08:22.800]  I gotta be honest with you, Gav.
[08:23.280 --> 08:24.420]  I don't think this one does.
[08:24.640 --> 08:25.480]  I don't think it does.
[08:25.580 --> 08:27.320]  It clearly doesn't do what it says it does.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.840]  And from what I can tell, it doesn't do anything else either.
[08:32.980 --> 08:34.160]  So, easy feat.
[08:34.340 --> 08:37.280]  I'm afraid you've been relegated to the pile of don't.
[08:43.200 --> 08:45.380]  Thanks for tuning in to another episode of Does It Do?
[08:45.940 --> 08:52.380]  We'll see you next time when we determine the next thing in whatever it does.
[08:55.790 --> 08:56.850]  Where'd my shoe go?
[08:58.630 --> 09:02.850]  We're Geoff and Gavin, and we're very excited for you to check out our new show,
[09:03.150 --> 09:04.470]  Does It Do?
[09:04.890 --> 09:09.710]  Where we determine if the products you see on television or the internet or social media
[09:10.270 --> 09:11.150]  actually do...
[09:11.150 --> 09:12.430]  You wanna know what's going on in your neighbor's life?
[09:12.510 --> 09:13.950]  ...what they say they're gonna do.
[09:14.010 --> 09:15.710]  Let's see if we can clean the babe up.
[09:15.710 --> 09:17.930]  Tune in, because it's gonna be fun.
[09:18.310 --> 09:19.750]  I broke my ass.
