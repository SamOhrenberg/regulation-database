[00:00.000 --> 00:03.880]  This season of Does It Do is sponsored by our friends at Shady Rays.
[00:04.240 --> 00:04.840]  Shady Rays!
[00:05.280 --> 00:05.720]  Wear glasses.
[00:06.140 --> 00:10.540]  I am Geoff, and this is Gavin, and we are research employees at Uniform.
[00:11.120 --> 00:14.220]  Uniform. Combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm.
[00:14.540 --> 00:17.620]  Uniform. We are contractually obligated to say that, and we love it.
[00:17.700 --> 00:21.900]  Our job is to take a look at the products that you see on television, on the internet, on social media,
[00:22.160 --> 00:25.620]  that say that they're just too good to be true. They promise to do these insane things.
[00:25.620 --> 00:29.820]  And we test them out, and we determine if they do do those things using the...
[00:29.820 --> 00:30.940]  What do we call it, Gavin? The who?
[00:31.100 --> 00:31.640]  The fun.
[00:32.040 --> 00:34.520]  Right. The who, the how, and the what?
[00:34.880 --> 00:35.480]  The why. Who?
[00:35.920 --> 00:36.760]  The egg sitter.
[00:37.300 --> 00:42.300]  Gavin, they say that this sucker circulates air through its honeycomb design.
[00:42.480 --> 00:46.300]  It is so amazing you can sit on an egg without breaking it.
[00:46.520 --> 00:48.360]  But will it fix my sore ass?
[00:48.700 --> 00:50.740]  There's one way to find out. Let's grab the eggs.
[00:50.920 --> 00:51.960]  How's your sore ass, Gavin?
[00:52.400 --> 00:52.940]  Pretty sore.
[00:52.940 --> 00:55.820]  Why don't you come over here and plop down on this guy and see if it...
[00:55.820 --> 00:58.200]  Well, first I need a benchmark without it.
[00:59.340 --> 01:00.480]  Oh, that's no good.
[01:04.200 --> 01:04.880]  Watch air.
[01:06.100 --> 01:07.180]  Do you feel like you're sitting on a cloud?
[01:07.680 --> 01:09.540]  That feels pretty much the same.
[01:09.780 --> 01:10.080]  Let me see.
[01:10.740 --> 01:11.440]  Oh, God.
[01:20.440 --> 01:21.240]  You're crazy.
[01:21.840 --> 01:26.020]  That feels so much better. My ass feels so much better.
[01:26.260 --> 01:27.560]  But what about an egg without it?
[01:27.980 --> 01:30.580]  Supposedly, I could sit on the egg and it wouldn't break.
[01:30.580 --> 01:32.040]  You want to go straight on with this?
[01:32.180 --> 01:32.920]  Yeah, we'll just try it.
[01:33.180 --> 01:34.020]  No benchmark, huh?
[01:34.760 --> 01:35.380]  What do you mean?
[01:36.160 --> 01:38.920]  Well, we would need to see if your ass would break the egg without that.
[01:40.820 --> 01:41.900]  Oh. Yeah, that's a good call.
[01:47.800 --> 01:48.980]  That's what a chicken feels like.
[01:49.960 --> 01:52.380]  You're doing it. You haven't popped it.
[01:52.920 --> 01:53.860]  Where is the egg right now?
[01:54.480 --> 01:55.140]  It's in me.
[01:55.760 --> 01:58.340]  No, I can actually push pretty hard and it's still not going to break.
[01:58.340 --> 02:00.900]  I've got to be honest with you.
[02:01.100 --> 02:04.000]  Maybe I have an extra soft ass.
[02:09.300 --> 02:10.500]  That's most of my weight there.
[02:10.600 --> 02:13.640]  What if we were at a party and I'm like...
[02:13.640 --> 02:14.540]  So anyway, I...
[02:16.860 --> 02:18.520]  It shot through my leg.
[02:19.640 --> 02:20.200]  So it broke.
[02:20.640 --> 02:22.240]  Is there some egg on me?
[02:22.420 --> 02:23.220]  Yeah, let me get that for you.
[02:23.220 --> 02:24.280]  That's right in my ute hole.
[02:24.340 --> 02:24.940]  Let me get you there.
[02:25.720 --> 02:26.340]  Here, bend over.
[02:27.940 --> 02:28.420]  Wipe it off.
[02:30.400 --> 02:31.520]  It's okay, I've got a kid.
[02:31.660 --> 02:33.960]  We can do that now that I've been your best man.
[02:34.280 --> 02:35.820]  That thing is really grippy.
[02:35.940 --> 02:37.080]  Could you catch an egg in it?
[02:37.820 --> 02:39.180]  I think so. Let's see.
[02:44.950 --> 02:46.070]  It missed the top.
[02:48.750 --> 02:50.350]  So here you are. You're at a party.
[02:50.810 --> 02:51.810]  You're sitting on your egg.
[02:52.710 --> 02:54.090]  Just doing an egg sit.
[02:56.170 --> 02:56.530]  Ooh.
[02:57.290 --> 02:59.370]  So anyway, I says to the guy...
[03:01.250 --> 03:02.210]  You're going to love this story.
[03:02.490 --> 03:03.850]  So I'm talking to him and I'm like,
[03:03.930 --> 03:05.030]  that's never going to fit.
[03:05.410 --> 03:06.570]  You can't do that with an egg.
[03:06.590 --> 03:07.370]  And he's like, watch me.
[03:08.010 --> 03:08.890]  And he made it fit.
[03:09.410 --> 03:10.230]  All right, now you try.
[03:10.590 --> 03:10.830]  Okay.
[03:15.020 --> 03:15.980]  I'm sitting pretty hard.
[03:19.740 --> 03:21.120]  No, that broke. That one broke.
[03:22.780 --> 03:23.380]  Did it really?
[03:23.460 --> 03:24.300]  It eventually broke.
[03:24.300 --> 03:25.980]  It held. Oh, it's cold.
[03:26.500 --> 03:27.560]  It held for a while.
[03:28.060 --> 03:28.960]  Hold on, bend over.
[03:29.720 --> 03:30.260]  Oh, no.
[03:32.380 --> 03:33.280]  Wipe up, okay?
[03:37.560 --> 03:38.380]  It's just egg.
[03:38.760 --> 03:39.320]  It's just egg.
[03:39.940 --> 03:40.780]  Everybody has them.
[03:41.160 --> 03:41.440]  Okay.
[03:41.740 --> 03:42.980]  Let's say you're not at a party.
[03:43.760 --> 03:45.340]  Let's say you just want to...
[03:45.340 --> 03:46.340]  You're just a heavy sitter.
[03:46.540 --> 03:46.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:47.660 --> 03:48.760]  That's fine for that situation.
[03:48.980 --> 03:50.960]  But what if you're into extreme sitting?
[03:50.960 --> 03:57.660]  Okay, well, you missed.
[03:58.200 --> 04:01.660]  What if you're a guy who likes to sit, who likes to jump sit?
[04:01.920 --> 04:02.120]  Okay.
[04:04.040 --> 04:04.520]  Like...
[04:04.520 --> 04:05.160]  Maybe I should go higher.
[04:05.640 --> 04:07.280]  No, your spine will break.
[04:07.800 --> 04:08.500]  Not with this?
[04:08.680 --> 04:09.100]  That's true.
[04:11.680 --> 04:12.780]  Nope, nope.
[04:13.360 --> 04:14.100]  That broke immediately.
[04:15.340 --> 04:16.840]  That one broke immediately.
[04:17.400 --> 04:18.020]  All right, let me try.
[04:20.840 --> 04:21.940]  Oh, I think that lived.
[04:23.160 --> 04:23.640]  Oh.
[04:24.240 --> 04:25.360]  That's a good-looking egg.
[04:26.280 --> 04:29.340]  I've ripped my...
[04:29.340 --> 04:31.260]  Oh, yeah, I can see the business.
[04:31.460 --> 04:32.560]  My breakfast popped out.
[04:32.800 --> 04:34.300]  All right, well...
[04:34.300 --> 04:39.000]  Does It Do Season 2 is made possible by our friends at Shady Rays.

[04:56.310 --> 04:58.310]  that won't crack the egg...

[05:21.440 --> 05:23.780]  maybe you're juggling your eggs, and then life happens.
[05:23.920 --> 05:28.660]  You trip, you drop your glasses, then you step on them, and then the dog picks them up
[05:28.660 --> 05:31.720]  and he rips them apart, and then you're trying to put the pieces back together,
[05:32.180 --> 05:33.980]  and then your house catches on fire.
[05:34.420 --> 05:37.260]  Oh my god, you had to leave them to escape with your life.
[05:37.580 --> 05:39.320]  But don't worry, Shady Rays has your back.

[05:43.440 --> 05:46.900]  So if you do catch your house on fire and then lose and break your pair,
[05:47.220 --> 05:48.580]  and then your dog eats it on the same day,
[05:48.880 --> 05:51.620]  they'll tell us that they'll send you a new pair, no questions asked.
[05:51.700 --> 05:55.700]  Although, honestly, a lot of questions should be asked about how that scenario happened.
[05:55.700 --> 05:59.620]  If you don't love your shades, exchange and return them for free within 30 days.
[05:59.840 --> 06:06.120]  There's no risk when you shop. Their team always has your back, with personal and fast support.

[06:22.320 --> 06:24.500]  That's a lot of math. I don't think it works that great.
[06:25.700 --> 06:28.840]  But what if we could, uh, what if we could find some other uses for it?
[06:28.860 --> 06:31.620]  Like maybe some, like a low-key chest armor. Do we have any tape? Here.
[06:46.490 --> 06:49.490]  Alright, if it protects the egg, it'll probably protect our organs.
[06:49.770 --> 06:52.050]  Okay, so what we'll do is we'll throw it up and then we'll chest bump.
[06:52.290 --> 06:54.070]  Okay, should we practice the chest bump?
[06:54.470 --> 06:56.450]  Yeah. Are you ready?
[06:56.670 --> 06:56.830]  Yep.
[06:57.930 --> 06:59.110]  Okay, that's good.
[07:00.410 --> 07:01.810]  Alright, now we're gonna throw the egg in the mix, okay?
[07:01.950 --> 07:02.670]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:03.290 --> 07:04.670]  On three or like...
[07:08.310 --> 07:09.930]  One, two, three.
[07:12.490 --> 07:13.430]  Did we get it?
[07:13.950 --> 07:16.910]  Well, it didn't smash the egg, the floor did.
[07:17.470 --> 07:19.170]  Maybe we'll just hold it in front of us.
[07:20.070 --> 07:20.290]  Okay.
[07:20.730 --> 07:21.370]  Little one?
[07:21.550 --> 07:21.690]  Yeah.
[07:22.370 --> 07:23.390]  Three, two, one.
[07:25.110 --> 07:26.030]  It saved it!
[07:26.750 --> 07:27.030]  Wow!
[07:27.570 --> 07:28.230]  Let's do it harder.
[07:36.340 --> 07:37.220]  It worked.
[07:39.140 --> 07:39.620]  Egg's fine.
[07:40.100 --> 07:41.440]  I'm gonna shit through my egg.
[07:45.440 --> 07:46.480]  Got the egg.
[07:48.420 --> 07:49.460]  The egg was saved.
[07:53.640 --> 07:54.560]  What else can we try?
[07:56.120 --> 07:57.300]  You wanna hit me with a chair?
[07:58.040 --> 08:00.660]  Oh, we strapped a bunch of eggs on your back.
[08:00.720 --> 08:02.080]  Yeah, yeah, let's do that.
[08:02.600 --> 08:04.180]  That was like an explosion.
[08:08.740 --> 08:09.640]  Alright, we need more tape.
[08:09.940 --> 08:15.560]  Now, I don't know how practical of a solution this is for protecting your eggs, but it's good to know that it's out there.
[08:15.920 --> 08:18.540]  And honestly, I feel like at this point it's more for science.
[08:19.120 --> 08:21.200]  This is how a lot of us at Unifarm carry our young.
[08:21.780 --> 08:27.860]  Okay, so you've got five, what I would call, one, two, five poimals on your back.
[08:28.100 --> 08:28.740]  Are they throbbing?
[08:29.160 --> 08:30.060]  They're throbbing.
[08:32.780 --> 08:33.500]  Oh, God!
[08:33.840 --> 08:34.160]  Oh!
[08:36.360 --> 08:38.360]  Now, if this was wrestling, I'd be real mad at you right now.
[08:38.660 --> 08:41.020]  Yeah, but you gotta have the egg, the thing on there, right?
[08:41.900 --> 08:42.840]  You don't wanna do the control first?
[08:43.000 --> 08:43.140]  Oh!
[08:45.860 --> 08:46.980]  It's a good call, I almost forgot.
[08:48.060 --> 08:50.600]  Maybe you're a professional wrestler and you wanna hit your buddy with a chair.
[08:50.700 --> 08:52.620]  Everybody knows wrestling's fake, except for Eric, don't tell him.
[08:52.920 --> 08:54.600]  And you're scared you're gonna hurt him.
[08:55.080 --> 08:58.600]  So maybe you put one of these on your chair and you make it look like a regular chair.
[08:58.980 --> 09:01.280]  Like it's gonna really hurt, but it's not gonna hurt, you're just gonna whack him.
[09:01.720 --> 09:02.340]  He'll feel good.
[09:02.340 --> 09:03.860]  It won't even break his eggs.
[09:04.320 --> 09:04.720]  Oh!
[09:05.200 --> 09:06.280]  That was alright, actually.
[09:06.360 --> 09:07.180]  I think all my eggs...
[09:07.180 --> 09:07.920]  Did I hit you too hard?
[09:08.120 --> 09:10.220]  Did I hit you harder?
[09:10.500 --> 09:11.280]  Uh, yeah, I think so.
[09:11.480 --> 09:11.660]  Okay.
[09:12.920 --> 09:13.320]  Oh!
[09:13.520 --> 09:14.540]  Yeah, I'm taking these.
[09:14.660 --> 09:15.500]  I'm taking these like a champ.
[09:15.580 --> 09:15.920]  Go again.
[09:16.060 --> 09:16.320]  Alright.
[09:17.480 --> 09:18.600]  Put some welly into it.
[09:26.840 --> 09:29.900]  I guess in this one specific instance it works pretty well.
[09:30.580 --> 09:37.900]  If you're a professional wrestler and you want to hit somebody with a chair and you want to make it look like it hurts but you don't want to break their eggs...
[09:39.460 --> 09:40.660]  I guess use this.
[09:41.500 --> 09:42.200]  There you go.
[09:42.780 --> 09:43.280]  Hole of Duke?
[09:43.900 --> 09:44.900]  Yeah, but at the bottom.
[09:45.100 --> 09:46.020]  At the very bottom.
[09:46.360 --> 09:46.600]  Okay.
[09:51.660 --> 09:52.080]  Oh!
[10:01.340 --> 10:04.420]  The Egg Sitter is worth considering.
[10:05.380 --> 10:06.200]  Thanks for listening.
[10:07.380 --> 10:08.240]  And probably watching.
[10:08.720 --> 10:09.840]  We'll see you next week.
[10:13.040 --> 10:14.000]  Now for the control.
[10:14.100 --> 10:14.580]  Oh, that one.
[10:14.640 --> 10:15.200]  I felt that one.
[10:15.480 --> 10:17.360]  I got a bloody lip when we collided.
[10:18.140 --> 10:19.140]  I was just trying to hide it.
[10:19.500 --> 10:20.380]  I didn't want to get shut down.
[10:20.720 --> 10:21.480]  I don't want to get in trouble.
[10:22.100 --> 10:23.580]  I was just swallowing blood the whole time.
