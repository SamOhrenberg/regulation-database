[00:02.310 --> 00:05.010]  Hello and welcome to another episode of Does It Do?
[00:05.230 --> 00:08.670]  I am your host, Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Gavin Free.
[00:08.770 --> 00:11.870]  We are employees of Unifarm and our job...oh, sorry, Unifarm.
[00:12.110 --> 00:14.970]  Combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm. Unifarm.
[00:15.450 --> 00:20.430]  We are here today to test the efficacy of the products that you've seen on the internet,
[00:20.670 --> 00:23.610]  on social media, on television, that seem like wonder products.
[00:23.690 --> 00:25.250]  Maybe a little too good to be true.
[00:25.530 --> 00:26.930]  We're going to test these products out.
[00:26.930 --> 00:34.470]  We're going to determine the what, the how, and the why does it do what it says it does.
[00:34.570 --> 00:36.810]  That didn't make any sense. It rarely does.
[00:38.390 --> 00:40.350]  Today's product...Gavin, this is an easy one for us.
[00:40.530 --> 00:42.870]  This one is just silicone ice pop mods.
[00:43.150 --> 00:44.930]  These are really popular all over social media right now.
[00:45.030 --> 00:46.810]  Everybody's buying them. Everybody's freezing stuff.
[00:46.970 --> 00:50.230]  We want to determine how useful these things really are.
[00:50.990 --> 00:54.230]  I've got some products we could try to freeze.
[00:54.730 --> 00:57.370]  You ever had a pasta pop, Gavin?
[00:58.610 --> 01:01.330]  Today we're going to give it a try. Here's some floor spaghetti I got right here.
[01:01.550 --> 01:03.050]  So you're going for sort of the full dinner.
[01:03.310 --> 01:05.370]  Yeah, I'm going for like a savory pop.
[01:05.490 --> 01:10.250]  You want spaghetti. You're hungry. You don't want hot food, but you want nourishing food.
[01:10.670 --> 01:13.210]  So is this concentrate? Like I dilute this, do I?
[01:13.910 --> 01:14.630]  I don't think you need to.
[01:14.750 --> 01:15.690]  Oh, it's all in French.
[01:17.110 --> 01:17.930]  Do you speak French?
[01:18.370 --> 01:20.710]  I mean, you've got to be able to figure it out, right?
[01:20.890 --> 01:21.110]  Yeah.
[01:21.790 --> 01:22.590]  Ajouter 2.
[01:24.950 --> 01:25.750]  A1 Tassie.
[01:27.250 --> 01:28.250]  Oh, it's in English, too.
[01:28.330 --> 01:29.530]  For broth, add two teaspoons.
[01:30.510 --> 01:31.150]  Ten mil.
[01:31.430 --> 01:33.230]  To one cup of...
[01:33.230 --> 01:37.330]  Okay, so it's like a 25 to 10 ratio.
[01:37.530 --> 01:37.690]  What?
[01:38.690 --> 01:42.310]  You ever go out on the town, you want a salad.
[01:42.730 --> 01:44.810]  The salad comes in and it's too hot for your liking.
[01:44.950 --> 01:45.990]  Like a warm salad.
[01:46.090 --> 01:47.270]  And you're like, I don't want a hot salad.
[01:47.910 --> 01:54.790]  Before you put salad dressing on it, consider taking a salad pop out of the freezer, sticking that in your hot salad.
[01:54.910 --> 01:58.630]  It'll cool it down and eventually provide...
[01:58.630 --> 01:59.350]  That's not enough.
[01:59.810 --> 02:01.110]  250 mil of that.
[02:01.510 --> 02:02.230]  That's probably enough.
[02:02.470 --> 02:03.690]  And then the rest is bavarois.
[02:04.630 --> 02:05.050]  Yeah. Oh!
[02:08.240 --> 02:09.060]  That'll spill there.
[02:10.160 --> 02:10.940]  No problem.
[02:11.260 --> 02:12.380]  Tons of vinaigrette.
[02:13.720 --> 02:14.240]  Slippery.
[02:15.420 --> 02:15.920]  Okay.
[02:19.700 --> 02:21.220]  What else could we freeze?
[02:21.540 --> 02:23.180]  Do we have any milk? Can we get some milk?
[02:23.660 --> 02:24.340]  And that one's done.
[02:24.840 --> 02:25.240]  Alright.
[02:25.960 --> 02:26.120]  Oh.
[02:26.880 --> 02:27.280]  Yep.
[02:29.060 --> 02:30.560]  That's quite hard to hold.
[02:30.680 --> 02:35.720]  Gavin, you might remember a while back Unifarm introduced a wild new product.
[02:36.220 --> 02:38.100]  It's kind of taken the nation by storm.
[02:38.280 --> 02:38.480]  Yeah.
[02:38.760 --> 02:39.660]  If not the whole world.
[02:39.760 --> 02:39.920]  Milk.
[02:40.240 --> 02:41.220]  Too spicy, icy.
[02:41.360 --> 02:41.720]  That's the one.
[02:41.740 --> 02:47.620]  Sometimes you have spicy food, about a day later you go to the bathroom, you have some trouble on the toilet, it's pretty painful.
[02:47.620 --> 02:49.560]  You need to soothe that area.
[02:50.100 --> 02:52.860]  Well, as everybody knows, that's where the too spicy, icy comes in.
[02:52.900 --> 02:53.660]  Do we want to do a cookie?
[02:54.300 --> 02:54.640]  Yeah.
[02:54.900 --> 02:56.100]  Yeah, we want to do a cookie, right?
[02:57.900 --> 02:59.920]  Sort of a non-traditional dessert.
[03:00.540 --> 03:02.080]  Let's get some other...
[03:02.080 --> 03:02.440]  Oh!
[03:03.220 --> 03:05.200]  Get some Sour Patch Kids in here.
[03:05.620 --> 03:08.220]  Because we do need a dessert one, a sweet one.
[03:08.340 --> 03:10.660]  Yeah, you want... we can't all be savory, right?
[03:10.700 --> 03:11.500]  Let's roll the savory.
[03:23.570 --> 03:24.910]  Let's put some more candies in there.
[03:24.910 --> 03:25.950]  Yeah, a thumb of cookie in.
[03:25.950 --> 03:27.450]  Definitely want to...
[03:27.450 --> 03:28.150]  Oh yeah, that's a good one.
[03:28.350 --> 03:28.950]  That's a great idea.
[03:29.510 --> 03:33.630]  And then what you're going to want to do with a concoction like this...
[03:33.630 --> 03:34.690]  Get it in there nice and good.
[03:35.250 --> 03:36.230]  Yeah, punch it in there.
[03:36.550 --> 03:36.910]  Ow!
[03:37.630 --> 03:40.950]  You want to fill it with a soda, like...
[03:41.550 --> 03:41.950]  Yeah.
[03:42.850 --> 03:44.510]  The fizzing, that's how you know it's working.
[03:45.150 --> 03:45.890]  Canada Dry.
[03:46.810 --> 03:48.070]  Nice little ginger ale.
[03:48.490 --> 03:51.830]  It's going to be bright and effervescent.
[03:53.370 --> 03:56.310]  Looking a little wet in the bread there.
[03:58.310 --> 04:00.210]  That's quite hard to hear and look at.
[04:00.490 --> 04:02.190]  Yeah, okay. So there's that one.
[04:03.410 --> 04:08.210]  I'll tell you what, Gav, let's pop these in the freezer and we'll come back in a little bit and see how they did.
[04:10.670 --> 04:11.030]  Transition.
[04:11.630 --> 04:13.530]  Gav, it's been about an hour, I would say.
[04:13.630 --> 04:15.510]  Why don't we check in on those popsicles, see how they're doing.
[04:15.710 --> 04:15.930]  Yep.
[04:17.270 --> 04:18.670]  Oh, looking good.
[04:18.670 --> 04:23.870]  All right, well we had an oopsie with the spaghetti.
[04:25.390 --> 04:26.630]  You love spaghetti, you're Italian.
[04:26.790 --> 04:26.950]  Yeah.
[04:27.130 --> 04:28.230]  You were just in Italy, right?
[04:28.290 --> 04:29.670]  You just went and spent time with your family in Italy?
[04:29.930 --> 04:30.150]  Yep.
[04:30.370 --> 04:31.690]  Did you eat any pasta while you were there?
[04:31.810 --> 04:32.170]  Loads.
[04:32.430 --> 04:33.190]  You want some of this?
[04:33.870 --> 04:36.670]  Try a little frozen pasta, a little summer pasta treat.
[04:37.850 --> 04:38.210]  Oh.
[04:39.690 --> 04:40.050]  Oh.
[04:43.390 --> 04:43.750]  Okay.
[04:44.910 --> 04:45.250]  All right.
[04:46.850 --> 04:47.590]  It's... all right.
[04:48.690 --> 04:50.030]  You were talking earlier, Gav.
[04:50.230 --> 04:50.810]  Oh, God.
[04:52.350 --> 04:59.690]  We were talking earlier about when your salad's hot, you want to cool off your salad.
[05:00.170 --> 05:02.250]  Let me see if this salad is the right temperature.
[05:02.790 --> 05:04.030]  It seems a little warm to me, right?
[05:04.670 --> 05:05.490]  Way too warm.
[05:05.770 --> 05:08.230]  Oh, that's... I can feel the heat coming off of that salad.
[05:08.370 --> 05:08.910]  Here, let's...
[05:08.910 --> 05:09.830]  It's like it's been in a bean hole.
[05:09.950 --> 05:13.230]  Let's put a little bit of... yeah, that's a bean hole salad if I've ever had it before.
[05:13.330 --> 05:13.930]  There we go.
[05:13.930 --> 05:14.290]  Okay.
[05:14.350 --> 05:15.910]  I'm going to feed you one of each.
[05:16.110 --> 05:16.150]  All right.
[05:16.150 --> 05:17.490]  I'm going to get a little bit of...
[05:17.490 --> 05:18.590]  I love me some salad.
[05:18.810 --> 05:19.490]  I love a crouton.
[05:19.970 --> 05:21.250]  And then just a little bit of...
[05:21.250 --> 05:21.270]  A little bit of dressing?
[05:21.370 --> 05:21.850]  A little bit of icy dressing.
[05:28.640 --> 05:29.000]  Refreshing.
[05:29.460 --> 05:30.880]  I can't wait to try that.
[05:31.800 --> 05:32.620]  But the salad's going in.
[05:32.620 --> 05:33.100]  I love...
[05:34.040 --> 05:34.860]  Love the salad.
[05:35.720 --> 05:36.520]  Way too hot.
[05:36.820 --> 05:37.820]  That's a hot crouton.
[05:38.980 --> 05:39.960]  This is a real salad.
[05:45.820 --> 05:46.600]  Let's keep going.
[05:46.680 --> 05:47.500]  What else did we make?
[05:47.500 --> 05:49.500]  Oh, Gav.
[05:51.300 --> 05:53.580]  Do you remember when we went out to dinner the other night?
[05:53.700 --> 05:53.880]  Yeah.
[05:54.580 --> 05:55.860]  And you had that...
[05:57.640 --> 05:58.780]  That spicy dish.
[05:58.860 --> 06:00.140]  You were all messed up for a while.
[06:01.920 --> 06:03.340]  Banana clears the palate, right?
[06:04.880 --> 06:10.780]  I'm having a little trouble getting this bad boy out, but...
[06:17.330 --> 06:18.830]  It's got a hinge on it.
[06:22.820 --> 06:23.680]  Not for leaning.
[06:24.660 --> 06:25.340]  What is that?
[06:26.280 --> 06:27.060]  Take your pants off.
[06:27.200 --> 06:28.440]  It's the Too Spicy Icy.
[06:29.920 --> 06:31.100]  See, that'd go right in there.
[06:34.140 --> 06:34.500]  Milky.
[06:36.820 --> 06:37.760]  Let's see what else we got.
[06:37.840 --> 06:38.420]  What else did we make?
[06:38.460 --> 06:39.200]  It's been so long, I forgot.
[06:40.280 --> 06:43.980]  Oh, remember when we made our refreshing cookie ice cream?
[06:46.520 --> 06:48.960]  Everybody loves candy on a hot summer day.
[06:53.730 --> 06:54.670]  Did you have some of that?
[06:56.270 --> 06:56.910]  Oh, oh!
[06:59.830 --> 07:00.450]  That's good.
[07:01.230 --> 07:02.330]  I'm gonna eat some more. You want some?
[07:03.130 --> 07:03.990]  I don't want that one.
[07:04.690 --> 07:05.450]  I'll try the Bovril.
[07:06.250 --> 07:08.390]  Alright, the piece de resistance, Gav.
[07:08.690 --> 07:09.590]  Can we upload this one?
[07:09.770 --> 07:10.110]  Yeah.
[07:10.950 --> 07:11.610]  Oh, is this the Bov?
[07:11.930 --> 07:13.490]  Everybody drinks Bovril when it's hot.
[07:13.550 --> 07:16.710]  A lot of people don't know, Bovril can cool you down on a hot day.
[07:16.950 --> 07:19.630]  Just as well as it can heat you up on a cool one.
[07:20.630 --> 07:21.970]  Oh, it's not even frozen!
[07:22.970 --> 07:26.170]  It was just cold goo?
[07:27.310 --> 07:28.770]  Yeah, that one didn't quite freeze.
[07:28.850 --> 07:29.170]  Oh!
[07:37.740 --> 07:39.460]  So, uh...
[07:49.640 --> 07:50.920]  It's beefy.
[07:52.940 --> 07:54.380]  It's so beefy.
[07:54.980 --> 07:56.220]  It's real beefy.
[07:57.180 --> 07:58.680]  It's salty beefy.
[08:01.360 --> 08:04.520]  Gav, I'm gonna go ahead and throw this over to the pile of don't, I think, right?
[08:04.980 --> 08:10.940]  I, nor Gavin, nor Uniform, can recommend anybody ever use these.
[08:11.400 --> 08:13.440]  These are hard pile of don't.
[08:14.680 --> 08:15.440]  Alright, there you go.
[08:15.940 --> 08:16.800]  Got any more bananas in there for me?
[08:16.800 --> 08:17.160]  Yeah, we do.
[08:18.140 --> 08:20.060]  That's the worst thing that was ever in my mouth.
[08:20.160 --> 08:20.380]  Yeah.
[08:21.560 --> 08:26.720]  We'll see you next week for another trip around the invention table
[08:27.280 --> 08:29.840]  to determine if some bullshit product is or isn't.
[08:30.960 --> 08:31.720]  I'm gonna be so sick.
[08:32.040 --> 08:32.560]  Oh, God.
[08:33.000 --> 08:33.560]  That was the worst.
[08:34.080 --> 08:34.580]  That was the worst.
