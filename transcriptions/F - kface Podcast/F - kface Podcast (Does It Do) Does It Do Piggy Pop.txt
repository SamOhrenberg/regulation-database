[00:00.000 --> 00:03.700]  This season of Does It Do is brought to you by our friends at Shady Rays.
[00:03.880 --> 00:05.860]  Shady Rays, there's sunglasses for your eyes.
[00:07.240 --> 00:07.820]  Piggy Pop.
[00:08.660 --> 00:09.660]  Does it really pop?
[00:09.940 --> 00:12.480]  Tune in to today's Does It Do to find out.
[00:16.260 --> 00:17.640]  Welcome to Does It Do.
[00:17.860 --> 00:18.680]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:18.740 --> 00:21.980]  With me, as always, my associate and fellow researcher, Gavin.
[00:22.640 --> 00:24.860]  We are employees of the Uniform Corporation.
[00:25.040 --> 00:27.720]  Uniform, combining the power of one with the fabric of the form.
[00:28.040 --> 00:28.400]  Uniform.
[00:28.400 --> 00:33.220]  And our job at the company is to take a look at products you may find on the internet,
[00:33.380 --> 00:37.060]  on social media, on television, that claim to do amazing things.
[00:37.360 --> 00:38.120]  But it's probably bullshit.
[00:38.740 --> 00:38.920]  Yeah.
[00:39.160 --> 00:40.140]  It's our job to find out.
[00:40.440 --> 00:41.820]  Do they do what they say they do?
[00:41.860 --> 00:44.320]  And we do that by the principles of...
[00:44.320 --> 00:45.020]  Pluthna.
[00:45.580 --> 00:45.980]  Pluthna.
[00:46.100 --> 00:47.420]  The who, the what, and the how.
[00:47.680 --> 00:48.400]  Do they do what they do.
[00:48.500 --> 00:49.380]  You know what's dog shit?
[00:50.160 --> 00:53.820]  How some food is always the same shape all the time.
[00:54.440 --> 00:55.120]  Such as?
[00:55.600 --> 00:56.280]  I like an egg.
[00:56.920 --> 00:58.960]  Oh, like you don't like that an egg is always egg-shaped.
[00:59.080 --> 00:59.200]  Yeah.
[00:59.700 --> 01:02.100]  What if it was a different shape that's also the same shape?
[01:02.760 --> 01:03.300]  Like a pig?
[01:04.860 --> 01:05.620]  Like a pig.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.340]  Okay, so this is a silicon baking pan.
[01:09.020 --> 01:10.100]  All right, step one.
[01:10.880 --> 01:12.160]  Let's make pigs in a blanket.
[01:12.420 --> 01:13.200]  When's the last time you had a hot dog?
[01:13.860 --> 01:14.960]  Maybe at a baseball game.
[01:15.320 --> 01:15.840]  Oh, here you go.
[01:16.060 --> 01:17.140]  Do I have to touch that with my hands?
[01:17.360 --> 01:18.980]  Well, you can touch it with your mouth in about 12 minutes.
[01:19.200 --> 01:20.180]  Well, it'd be hot then, wouldn't it?
[01:20.880 --> 01:21.900]  It won't be wet and cold.
[01:22.120 --> 01:23.120]  I'm gonna make some mitts.
[01:23.600 --> 01:23.860]  What?
[01:24.600 --> 01:26.040]  So I can touch the gross stuff.
[01:26.280 --> 01:27.140]  You ever cut up a hot dog before?
[01:27.600 --> 01:27.920]  With scissors?
[01:28.840 --> 01:29.820]  It feels good.
[01:30.060 --> 01:30.660]  I want to try it.
[01:30.780 --> 01:32.400]  You gotta put your safety mitts on.
[01:32.400 --> 01:32.900]  I'm all set.
[01:33.080 --> 01:33.580]  All right, here you go.
[01:35.900 --> 01:36.900]  That is great.
[01:37.100 --> 01:37.660]  It's nice.
[01:37.840 --> 01:38.680]  I'm gonna try and land one in.
[01:40.300 --> 01:41.660]  Yeah, it's always good to make a game out of something.
[01:41.760 --> 01:42.500]  Hey, you nailed that one.
[01:42.840 --> 01:43.860]  That's your lucky hot dog.
[01:46.080 --> 01:46.840]  And it's brother.
[01:49.400 --> 01:50.940]  I'm gonna freaking roll here.
[01:51.540 --> 01:53.280]  It turns out maybe it was just really easy to do.
[01:53.440 --> 01:53.800]  Twofer.
[01:55.020 --> 01:55.420]  Shit.
[01:56.220 --> 01:58.020]  You flew too close to the thing.
[01:58.340 --> 02:02.720]  First off, let's just see if it does the bog-stained job of...
[02:02.720 --> 02:03.320]  What are you doing?
[02:03.560 --> 02:05.300]  I hit myself with the dog water.
[02:07.100 --> 02:08.480]  Well, wipe it off on me, please.
[02:08.500 --> 02:08.840]  Thank you.
[02:09.380 --> 02:10.700]  It's messier than I thought it would be.
[02:10.700 --> 02:11.620]  What happened to the thing?
[02:12.220 --> 02:13.940]  It was not letting stuff come out.
[02:14.700 --> 02:15.580]  It was getting in the way.
[02:15.980 --> 02:18.180]  Oh, there's no pig definition now.
[02:18.780 --> 02:19.260]  You know what?
[02:19.260 --> 02:20.220]  We'll do a pig-only one.
[02:20.340 --> 02:20.900]  See what happens.
[02:21.360 --> 02:22.340]  Do we want to cram that down?
[02:22.340 --> 02:24.180]  Well, are you gonna touch it with your hand?
[02:25.800 --> 02:27.200]  Okay, that's probably good.
[02:27.560 --> 02:27.920]  Yeah.
[02:28.820 --> 02:29.780]  Oh, God!
[02:29.920 --> 02:31.540]  Oh, for Christ's sake.
[02:32.320 --> 02:33.040]  What do these cook at?
[02:33.120 --> 02:33.720]  12... 450?
[02:34.240 --> 02:34.560]  Yeah.
[02:34.920 --> 02:39.680]  In 15 minutes, we're gonna have delicious piggy pops.
[02:40.240 --> 02:41.300]  What if we started...
[02:41.300 --> 02:43.280]  Every morning you get up, you make your breakfast.
[02:43.500 --> 02:43.940]  Pigs.
[02:44.220 --> 02:44.380]  Yeah.
[02:44.640 --> 02:46.060]  You make a midday snack pig.
[02:46.960 --> 02:48.220]  Make a dinner pig.
[02:48.360 --> 02:49.120]  Maybe that's three.
[02:49.920 --> 02:51.160]  Little evening snack pig.
[02:51.160 --> 02:52.440]  And then some dessert pigs.
[02:53.040 --> 02:54.640]  Should we do... because it's gonna be too big.
[02:54.800 --> 02:57.120]  Should we do a yolk pig and a white pig?
[02:57.260 --> 02:57.500]  Yes.
[02:58.700 --> 02:58.960]  Oh.
[02:59.220 --> 03:00.640]  This is our white pig.
[03:04.260 --> 03:05.640]  That's smoking a little bit.
[03:06.400 --> 03:07.580]  Oh, that means it's working.
[03:07.880 --> 03:10.620]  This is really going out of control.
[03:13.340 --> 03:14.980]  How sensitive are the...
[03:19.600 --> 03:21.060]  Don't people cook stuff all the time?
[03:25.730 --> 03:27.510]  Next up, what if we made a sandwich?
[03:28.230 --> 03:29.030]  That's a great idea.
[03:29.210 --> 03:31.590]  I'm gonna make a ham and cheese sandwich pig.
[03:31.990 --> 03:33.290]  Oh, what about a pizza pig?
[03:33.470 --> 03:34.910]  Well, I will definitely make a pizza pig.
[03:35.030 --> 03:35.230]  Okay.
[03:35.490 --> 03:36.950]  I'm just gonna pop this in for a minute.
[03:37.670 --> 03:39.110]  So I'm gonna make two sandwiches.
[03:40.570 --> 03:41.510]  One will be ham.
[03:41.570 --> 03:41.930]  Oh, shit.
[03:44.550 --> 03:45.190]  Different speeds.
[03:45.710 --> 03:46.210]  Okay, ham and cheese.
[03:46.210 --> 03:47.310]  All right, so we got our ham and cheese sandwich.
[03:47.310 --> 03:48.930]  And why don't you get a pizza going in this one?
[03:48.950 --> 03:49.790]  I'll make a little pizza.
[03:50.190 --> 03:51.010]  Everybody loves pizza.
[03:51.010 --> 03:52.630]  See, now, if you...
[03:52.630 --> 03:54.330]  You may have to prepare this the night before.
[03:54.970 --> 04:00.270]  But, you know, preparation is nine-tenths planning, they say.
[04:00.810 --> 04:08.050]  So plan to have a successful day by preparing with your pizza.
[04:08.450 --> 04:12.450]  Does It Do season two made possible by our friends at Shady Rays.

[05:34.290 --> 05:35.610]  You guys have stores where you live?
[05:35.830 --> 05:36.590]  You should check them out.
[05:36.670 --> 05:37.830]  Sometimes they have things you don't expect.
[05:37.950 --> 05:42.270]  This store I went to had little gummy skulls.
[05:42.930 --> 05:45.030]  So how much fun is it for your kid, right?
[05:45.030 --> 05:46.330]  Like a pig skeleton?
[05:46.510 --> 05:47.670]  At the end of the day, yeah.
[05:47.770 --> 05:49.490]  You're like, they're like, I want dessert, mommy.
[05:49.510 --> 05:52.290]  And you're like, well, all we have, you know, you can have your pig.
[05:52.530 --> 05:55.050]  And they're like, but no, I want, I want yummy dessert.
[05:55.150 --> 05:56.750]  And you're like, well, maybe there's a surprise inside.
[05:57.010 --> 05:58.070]  There is a surprise, Gavin.
[05:58.390 --> 05:59.470]  It's a gummy skull.
[06:04.900 --> 06:08.560]  I feel like, I feel like a lot of our meals are sharing the same ingredients.
[06:08.880 --> 06:10.200]  It's all going in the same gullet.
[06:10.560 --> 06:10.820]  It's true.
[06:13.860 --> 06:14.500]  So that's that.
[06:14.620 --> 06:15.120]  That's a brownie.
[06:15.680 --> 06:16.420]  That's your brownie.
[06:16.720 --> 06:22.240]  Although I've just remembered that this, this part needs to go in the fridge, not the oven.
[06:30.950 --> 06:32.590]  Oh, that cuts like a tree.
[06:32.670 --> 06:33.130]  No, do both.
[06:33.370 --> 06:34.170]  Oh, no, no.
[06:34.190 --> 06:34.770]  The brownie needs to go.
[06:34.830 --> 06:35.250]  Yeah, right.
[06:35.330 --> 06:35.690]  Just do one.
[06:35.790 --> 06:36.190]  Just do one.
[06:36.810 --> 06:39.070]  And then, and that's the beauty of this thing.
[06:39.170 --> 06:40.550]  You can cut it right in half if you want to.
[06:40.590 --> 06:41.290]  You can make it smaller.
[06:41.510 --> 06:42.210]  You can make it bigger.
[06:42.290 --> 06:43.210]  You can glue these back together.
[06:43.490 --> 06:45.610]  You can put, this will maintain its integrity if you put it back together.
[06:45.670 --> 06:46.650]  We're gonna throw this in the freezer.
[06:46.930 --> 06:47.850]  We'll check on it later.
[06:48.290 --> 06:52.530]  Can you imagine how much more productive your day is going to be when you realize you're hungry?
[06:52.530 --> 06:53.590]  You don't have time to stop.
[06:53.650 --> 06:54.850]  You just reach into your pocket.
[06:54.990 --> 06:55.790]  You pop out a piggy.
[06:55.990 --> 06:56.610]  Put it in your mouth.
[06:56.670 --> 06:57.850]  Go right on, right along your way.
[06:57.950 --> 07:00.010]  So we're gonna go up about four something.
[07:01.190 --> 07:01.990]  Go there.
[07:02.570 --> 07:03.670]  We'll turn the fan on.
[07:03.890 --> 07:05.670]  Yeah, and then we can snack on a...
[07:06.310 --> 07:09.410]  Yeah, and that's gonna blow away our problems while you and I enjoy...
[07:10.050 --> 07:10.610]  Grab that guy.
[07:11.310 --> 07:12.290]  Careful around his brain.
[07:12.770 --> 07:14.610]  Yeah, he's not.
[07:15.230 --> 07:17.930]  Oh, that's so wet inside.
[07:18.610 --> 07:19.010]  Perfect.
[07:19.150 --> 07:19.970]  Little pig in a blanket.
[07:20.070 --> 07:20.570]  Look at that.
[07:20.790 --> 07:21.170]  Looks so...
[07:21.750 --> 07:22.390]  This one's good.
[07:23.190 --> 07:24.370]  Oh, that's yours.
[07:24.990 --> 07:26.270]  Oh, that's delicious.
[07:26.470 --> 07:26.990]  Look at that.
[07:32.940 --> 07:33.780]  Excellent catch.
[07:34.580 --> 07:36.480]  It's just so gooey and wet.
[07:36.700 --> 07:37.060]  Cheers.
[07:41.780 --> 07:42.760]  Oh, that's good.
[07:43.340 --> 07:44.540]  That is delicious.
[07:44.760 --> 07:45.200]  Pretty bad.
[07:45.340 --> 07:45.700]  I'm full.
[07:45.900 --> 07:46.900]  I'm gonna go over here for a second.
[07:47.020 --> 07:47.580]  I'll be right back.
[07:47.760 --> 07:47.960]  Yeah.
[07:54.930 --> 07:55.770]  That was...
[07:55.770 --> 07:57.350]  That was better than I thought it would be.
[07:59.850 --> 08:01.110]  Let's check in on our food.
[08:01.310 --> 08:02.210]  Oh, yeah, there we go.
[08:02.290 --> 08:02.510]  There we go.
[08:02.790 --> 08:03.610]  Look at that.
[08:03.830 --> 08:05.130]  Oh, that's a whole day...
[08:05.670 --> 08:05.930]  Hot.
[08:06.790 --> 08:08.150]  What did we cook that was pink?
[08:08.750 --> 08:09.590]  That was the skull.
[08:10.570 --> 08:12.530]  Oh, the dessert skull.
[08:13.110 --> 08:13.850]  It's actually...
[08:13.850 --> 08:16.430]  It's melted and exploded all over the brownie.
[08:16.730 --> 08:17.510]  Should we start with breakfast?
[08:18.430 --> 08:18.790]  Yeah.
[08:19.810 --> 08:20.110]  Okay.
[08:21.230 --> 08:21.930]  Brekkie's up.
[08:24.090 --> 08:25.890]  I've stolen the lunch!
[08:26.190 --> 08:26.490]  Ah!
[08:27.230 --> 08:27.750]  Ow!
[08:27.990 --> 08:28.790]  Oh, shit!
[08:28.790 --> 08:29.170]  Oh!
[08:34.330 --> 08:35.070]  It's a...
[08:35.530 --> 08:36.590]  Just a pig yolk.
[08:37.490 --> 08:38.230]  How is that?
[08:38.410 --> 08:38.590]  Is that good?
[08:44.350 --> 08:44.750]  Yolky.
[08:44.890 --> 08:45.790]  I'm watching my weight.
[08:45.930 --> 08:48.150]  So I'm gonna eat an egg white sandwich.
[08:49.210 --> 08:49.470]  Okay.
[08:50.370 --> 08:50.730]  Mmm.
[08:53.110 --> 08:53.510]  Yeah.
[08:53.810 --> 08:54.350]  Did you have any?
[08:54.570 --> 08:55.830]  Yeah, I had a little bit of ham and egg.
[08:56.330 --> 08:57.110]  I have a little bit more.
[08:57.270 --> 08:59.030]  Why didn't you show off the lovely pig shape?
[08:59.530 --> 09:01.470]  Should have put some salt and pepper on that fucker.
[09:01.890 --> 09:02.730]  It's not too late.
[09:03.290 --> 09:04.230]  Just do hard to touch.
[09:05.310 --> 09:05.590]  Ow!
[09:05.930 --> 09:07.090]  Oh, I know what we need.
[09:07.510 --> 09:08.610]  This should cool us down.
[09:17.880 --> 09:18.660]  There we go.
[09:20.560 --> 09:22.300]  Oh, it's getting the whole of do a little bit there.
[09:24.360 --> 09:24.940]  Oh, the pickle!
[09:27.740 --> 09:30.960]  You know, I'm good with the pickle, but it looks like it's sandwich time.
[09:31.120 --> 09:32.020]  Oh, are you ready for lunch?
[09:32.100 --> 09:33.640]  Here's my grilled ham and cheese.
[09:33.780 --> 09:34.320]  Oh, yummy!
[09:34.960 --> 09:35.560]  Oh, look at the...
[09:36.420 --> 09:37.540]  Oh, that's perfect pig.
[09:40.340 --> 09:40.660]  Ah!
[09:43.420 --> 09:44.060]  So hot.
[09:45.240 --> 09:46.740]  That is some hot cheese.
[09:47.080 --> 09:48.840]  Oh, look at my pizza pig.
[09:48.900 --> 09:49.340]  Oh, dude.
[09:49.660 --> 09:50.320]  You can see him.
[09:50.420 --> 09:51.240]  That looks top draw.
[09:51.540 --> 09:52.600]  Yeah, it's...
[09:53.100 --> 09:53.760]  Get it in there.
[09:53.900 --> 09:55.920]  Look at that, I just want the audience...
[09:55.920 --> 09:57.200]  Oh, yeah, he's beautiful.
[09:57.280 --> 09:58.240]  You can see his little pig face.
[09:58.560 --> 10:00.240]  Can you get in and zoom in?
[10:00.340 --> 10:00.820]  Yeah, that's good.
[10:13.200 --> 10:16.000]  There's a strong, strong cornbread flavor in my pizza.
[10:16.980 --> 10:18.220]  All right, well, we've had our dinner.
[10:18.320 --> 10:19.260]  Pizza dinner.
[10:19.460 --> 10:20.020]  We had our...
[10:20.020 --> 10:21.540]  You ready for some dessert?
[10:21.780 --> 10:23.060]  See if I can get a full pig out of this.
[10:23.600 --> 10:24.160]  All right, so...
[10:31.640 --> 10:32.040]  Yeah.
[10:33.600 --> 10:34.980]  That tasted like a melted gummy bear.
[10:35.380 --> 10:39.620]  And for the pH to resistance, we celebrate our dessert...
[10:39.620 --> 10:40.100]  Wow.
[10:40.200 --> 10:41.600]  ...with our chocolate pig.
[10:41.740 --> 10:43.300]  Oh, my God.
[10:43.340 --> 10:44.100]  He's perfect.
[10:44.440 --> 10:44.920]  Cheese on that.
[10:50.020 --> 10:51.180]  Is that saliva on it?
[10:51.400 --> 10:53.180]  Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
[10:53.820 --> 10:54.720]  You should get...
[10:54.720 --> 10:55.840]  You should eat that, little brother.
[11:02.610 --> 11:04.930]  That's 100% chocolate right there.
[11:11.520 --> 11:13.200]  You gotta swallow it.
[11:13.720 --> 11:14.440]  You gotta get it out.
[11:15.200 --> 11:15.800]  Get your...
[11:15.800 --> 11:16.400]  Eat your food.
[11:16.480 --> 11:17.640]  Get your dessert out, big boy.
[11:21.560 --> 11:22.220]  I'll blow it up.
[11:30.240 --> 11:31.200]  I need...
[11:31.200 --> 11:32.600]  Get it out of my tug.
[11:33.020 --> 11:33.660]  Pallet cleanser.
[11:34.720 --> 11:35.340]  I'll take it.
[11:35.440 --> 11:35.600]  Fuck.
[11:37.660 --> 11:38.440]  I didn't help.
[11:38.520 --> 11:38.940]  I didn't help.
[11:39.060 --> 11:39.480]  I didn't help.
[11:40.200 --> 11:41.200]  I didn't help at all.
[11:43.680 --> 11:45.380]  There's so much more chocolate in my mouth.
[11:45.420 --> 11:46.300]  Where's it coming from?
[11:47.840 --> 11:48.920]  All right, well...
[11:56.340 --> 11:56.740]  So...
[11:58.400 --> 11:59.000]  Piggy Pop.
[12:00.880 --> 12:01.600]  What do we think?
[12:02.200 --> 12:04.600]  Pile of do or pile of don't?
[12:04.900 --> 12:05.380]  It, uh...
[12:12.390 --> 12:13.950]  It can't all be winners, folks.
[12:14.750 --> 12:16.070]  That one's for the pile of don't.
[12:16.150 --> 12:18.030]  Maybe next time it'll be for the haul of do.
[12:18.390 --> 12:21.290]  You'll find out when you tune in to the next episode of...
[12:22.730 --> 12:23.430]  Does It Do?
