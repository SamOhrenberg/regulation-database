[00:00.000 --> 00:04.900]  Season 2 of Does It Do is brought to you by our friends at Shady Rays.
[00:05.380 --> 00:08.360]  Sock Slider. Does it sock? Does it slide?
[00:08.680 --> 00:11.580]  Find out today on Does It Do.
[00:11.880 --> 00:13.900]  Ba-na-na-na-na-ba-da-na-na.
[00:13.920 --> 00:15.720]  Wake it through the rest of Does It Do.
[00:15.860 --> 00:17.520]  Did it do? It didn't do.
[00:17.660 --> 00:18.860]  Maybe it did do.
[00:18.980 --> 00:21.180]  We'll find out today for you.
[00:21.600 --> 00:22.240]  Does It Do.
[00:22.680 --> 00:23.560]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:23.580 --> 00:26.080]  With me, as always, my lovely assistant Gavin.
[00:26.080 --> 00:26.380]  Hello!
[00:26.660 --> 00:28.220]  We are employees of Unifarm.
[00:28.220 --> 00:31.720]  Unifarm, combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm.
[00:32.100 --> 00:32.420]  Unifarm.
[00:32.640 --> 00:37.620]  And our job at the company is to test a lot of the products that you're going to see on the internet,
[00:37.760 --> 00:40.200]  on the social media, on the television, all over the world, really.
[00:40.360 --> 00:41.380]  Maybe even a billboard you saw.
[00:41.560 --> 00:44.280]  And you think to yourself, well, that product, that's too good to be true.
[00:45.580 --> 00:46.500]  Our job is to find out.
[00:46.620 --> 00:48.400]  Oh, and we're going to do the who.
[00:49.160 --> 00:51.160]  The who, the what, and the why.
[00:51.460 --> 00:53.940]  How does it do what it does?
[00:54.880 --> 00:56.800]  It's supposed to make our lives easier, Gavin.
[00:56.800 --> 01:03.980]  I know that you are the kind of man who gets up every day, puts his shoes on, puts his socks on first.
[01:05.020 --> 01:05.380]  Yeah.
[01:05.500 --> 01:06.480]  Goes through that hassle.
[01:06.620 --> 01:10.300]  But nowadays, you know, a bit of a groan every time I have to bend down.
[01:10.420 --> 01:11.880]  Yeah, you're getting up there in age, huh?
[01:11.920 --> 01:12.060]  Yeah.
[01:12.240 --> 01:14.700]  Now, supposedly what we do, it's Boston Celtics sock.
[01:14.820 --> 01:15.620]  Go Celtics.
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.040]  I don't want to talk about the in-season tournament.
[01:18.600 --> 01:19.840]  I don't want to bend down.
[01:19.880 --> 01:20.920]  I'm too old and tired.
[01:23.560 --> 01:24.280]  Oh, wow!
[01:24.880 --> 01:26.200]  That was so cool.
[01:26.640 --> 01:28.700]  Now I can put my sock on my shoe.
[01:31.680 --> 01:32.040]  Perfect.
[01:32.580 --> 01:34.080]  I think you can go in with more speed.
[01:34.480 --> 01:36.020]  I can probably get a better... let's go on the ground.
[01:37.060 --> 01:38.140]  I can probably get a better angle.
[01:39.180 --> 01:43.060]  This is even easier than getting... I mean, once you get your sock out of your drawer, it's already in your hand.
[01:43.220 --> 01:48.080]  You might as well spend 18 to 45 seconds putting it on this contraption in your lap, right?
[01:48.800 --> 01:50.280]  You want to do it like a...
[01:50.280 --> 01:56.300]  Where if you do this, you'll be here, and then you can take another step and come straight into your shoe here.
[01:56.300 --> 01:56.980]  Okay, that's smart.
[01:57.120 --> 01:59.180]  You want to put it where you think it goes.
[01:59.540 --> 02:00.040]  I'm ready.
[02:00.880 --> 02:04.420]  Oh, I'm late for work! I got to get out of the house fast! I don't have time!
[02:07.960 --> 02:08.980]  I got to be honest with you.
[02:09.200 --> 02:10.220]  That was pretty good.
[02:10.360 --> 02:13.620]  I'm like 85%. Like, this is appropriate. This is normal.
[02:14.740 --> 02:17.540]  I'm like, you know, could have gone a little better, but I got it.
[02:18.080 --> 02:21.320]  Yeah, that said, you can get on the train like that. You can drive a car like that.
[02:21.480 --> 02:23.940]  Do you think you could beat your time? There was a little bit of a pause before.
[02:24.220 --> 02:24.880]  Oh, I could definitely beat my time.
[02:24.880 --> 02:25.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:25.600 --> 02:28.840]  Oh, look at that! I'm even later for work than I was yesterday! I got to go!
[02:34.440 --> 02:35.040]  Missed a shoe.
[02:41.860 --> 02:44.660]  There might be a speed with which it's unsafe to try.
[02:44.880 --> 02:45.780]  Where's the thing gone?
[02:45.900 --> 02:48.640]  It definitely improved the speed of my morning routine.
[02:48.640 --> 02:52.620]  I was out the door way, probably seven, eight seconds faster than I would have been.
[02:53.020 --> 02:54.200]  So it does that right away.
[02:55.480 --> 02:57.740]  But what else does it do, Gavin? We don't want to stop there.
[02:57.900 --> 03:01.760]  You know when you make a sandwich and all of your bread comes out of the bread bag?
[03:02.180 --> 03:02.840]  Oh, I can...
[03:02.840 --> 03:04.620]  Because you didn't buy the f*** face bread clip.
[03:05.040 --> 03:07.520]  I know exactly what you're talking about. I don't have my f*** face bread clip on.
[03:07.620 --> 03:11.860]  So I go to pick up my bread. I grab the wrong end. Like, it's folded and I grab the wrong end.
[03:11.940 --> 03:13.280]  I'm like, oh, sh**!
[03:14.380 --> 03:16.120]  How am I going to get all that bread back in?
[03:16.740 --> 03:21.780]  Luckily for us, we have the bread slider.
[03:22.440 --> 03:23.420]  Alright, should I go for it?
[03:23.660 --> 03:25.640]  Yeah, I would go just like pretty fast too, right?
[03:25.660 --> 03:26.080]  Okay, you ready?
[03:26.220 --> 03:27.180]  Yeah, I think speed's the way.
[03:27.620 --> 03:28.200]  Okay, here we go.
[03:28.440 --> 03:28.600]  Okay.
[03:36.890 --> 03:38.070]  You got most of it.
[03:39.070 --> 03:40.450]  It wasn't very deep on that.
[03:40.710 --> 03:41.790]  A lot of paint on that bread.
[03:42.510 --> 03:43.290]  Should we try one more time?
[03:43.370 --> 03:43.510]  Yeah.
[03:45.450 --> 03:48.490]  Oh, smart. Yeah, get your mouth germs in there.
[03:48.490 --> 03:48.650]  Yeah.
[03:49.030 --> 03:49.270]  Okay.
[03:50.270 --> 03:51.070]  Alright, hold it good.
[03:51.630 --> 03:52.610]  That's not going to be enough.
[03:52.970 --> 03:53.710]  This won't be enough?
[03:54.830 --> 03:55.270]  Okay.
[03:55.530 --> 03:56.710]  Hold it with your mingy little... there you go.
[03:56.970 --> 03:57.310]  Are you ready?
[03:57.490 --> 03:57.710]  Yep.
[03:58.030 --> 03:59.990]  Oh, I got to get my bread back in the bag!
[04:04.620 --> 04:05.300]  Nailed it.
[04:06.420 --> 04:10.300]  And just like that, back on the shelf. Bread secured.
[04:10.880 --> 04:11.580]  Home run.
[04:11.780 --> 04:20.340]  Hey, it's your old pal, Johnny Caviar, here to tell you about Doesn't Do Season 2 and how it's been made possible by our friends at Shady Rays.
[04:20.340 --> 04:26.160]  Our future's so bright, we're all going to need new shades to protect our eyes from the bright future because it's too bright.
[04:26.320 --> 04:33.500]  Our friends at Shady Rays have you covered with premium polarized shades that won't break the caviar bank.
[04:33.600 --> 04:41.760]  They are an independent sunglass company that offers a world-class product that is just as good as any expensive pair that we've worn.
[04:41.820 --> 04:43.440]  It's also just as good as caviar.
[04:43.700 --> 04:48.260]  So picture this. You're wearing your shades, like I am here. You feel like a million bucks.
[04:48.260 --> 04:56.800]  And then, life happens. You drop them. You sit on them. Maybe your dog thinks that they're a new chew toy.
[04:57.040 --> 05:02.480]  But that's okay because Shady Rays has your back. That company is like the superhero of eyewear.
[05:03.280 --> 05:06.740]  They tell us that they'll send you a brand new pair, no questions asked.
[05:06.860 --> 05:10.740]  And if you don't love your shades, exchange and return them for free within 30 days.
[05:10.960 --> 05:15.840]  There's no risk when you shop. Their team always has your back with personal and fast support.
[05:16.780 --> 05:20.180]  Exclusively for our listeners, Shady Rays is giving out their best deal.
[05:22.000 --> 05:23.460]  Don't tell anybody else about this.
[05:23.800 --> 05:31.740]  But if you head to ShadyRays.com right now and use code DOESITDO, you get 50% off two or more pairs of polarized sunglasses.
[05:33.700 --> 05:39.980]  Try it for yourself. The shades rated 5 stars by over 250,000 people. That is a quarter of a million people.
[05:40.280 --> 05:41.760]  That's a lot of stars. That's a lot of glasses.
[05:41.760 --> 05:46.360]  Why stop there though, Gavin? Let's be more complicated with it.
[05:46.740 --> 05:50.620]  How often do you try to put your bread back in the bag? Let's be honest. It happens on occasion, but not every day, right?
[05:50.860 --> 05:53.060]  However, I know you. You love a pita.
[05:53.500 --> 05:53.820]  I do.
[05:54.020 --> 05:57.020]  You love to eat a pita. What's the worst part about eating a pita?
[05:58.320 --> 05:59.540]  Putting the stuff in it.
[05:59.740 --> 06:03.960]  Oh, it's the worst. It takes forever. It's always falling out the sides.
[06:04.220 --> 06:08.060]  Well, I have an idea for a way to make it easier for us.
[06:08.340 --> 06:10.020]  Here's some lettuce we dug out of the trash.
[06:11.520 --> 06:14.780]  That's not bad. What if I go long?
[06:15.520 --> 06:20.460]  Sometimes you can't get to the other side of the kitchen... and you need a hand.
[06:20.860 --> 06:23.860]  You're like, I gotta make this pizza in a hurry. I don't have time to bend over.
[06:29.070 --> 06:29.830]  A little bit of it.
[06:33.050 --> 06:33.950]  I have no idea what you're saying.
[06:40.440 --> 06:42.120]  You can really taste the trash can in that lettuce.
[06:42.460 --> 06:42.960]  It's a bit of paint.
[06:43.700 --> 06:46.000]  What would you say is the sock of the head?
[06:48.300 --> 06:49.020]  The balaclava.
[06:49.300 --> 06:52.620]  So say you live in Wisconsin. It gets cold in Wisconsin.
[06:52.960 --> 06:56.880]  Maybe you live up in the top of the mid in Michigan where it gets real cold.
[06:57.160 --> 06:59.800]  It's probably negative five degrees outside right now and it's only December.
[07:00.080 --> 07:01.760]  Yeah, it's Mackinac, right?
[07:02.600 --> 07:04.300]  You don't want to go outside without your balaclava.
[07:04.420 --> 07:07.300]  But who wants to bend over to put their balaclava on?
[07:07.340 --> 07:07.780]  Why would you?
[07:08.260 --> 07:10.400]  When you can do this.
[07:20.020 --> 07:20.800]  Looks okay.
[07:21.480 --> 07:23.320]  The nose going through the aisle.
[07:27.380 --> 07:32.370]  That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
[07:32.590 --> 07:34.450]  You know what's important, Gavin?
[07:35.870 --> 07:36.910]  Practicing safe sex.
[07:37.230 --> 07:37.630]  That's true.
[07:38.730 --> 07:40.630]  Something everybody should endeavor to do.
[07:41.770 --> 07:42.950]  Oh, you're thinking what I'm thinking, I see.
[07:43.150 --> 07:43.870]  Magnum dong.
[07:44.510 --> 07:47.190]  I've never actually seen one of these. I mean, I see these all the time.
[07:48.950 --> 07:49.830]  I can't stand it.
[07:49.930 --> 07:53.190]  Maybe you have an issue. Maybe you want to have intercourse.
[07:53.770 --> 07:55.250]  You like to have intercourse.
[07:56.670 --> 07:58.050]  You want to please your partner.
[07:58.130 --> 07:59.390]  Why don't I hold it and you put it on?
[07:59.430 --> 08:01.850]  But you don't want to touch your own peanut.
[08:01.990 --> 08:02.650]  Oh, that one ripped.
[08:03.970 --> 08:05.790]  That's going to be tough. I'll hold it steady.
[08:08.870 --> 08:10.030]  This is sponsored, right?
[08:10.670 --> 08:10.970]  Oh.
[08:12.070 --> 08:13.890]  All right, we're going to have to be more gentle with that. Let me try.
[08:29.360 --> 08:29.680]  Oh.
[08:31.020 --> 08:34.240]  So say you want to practice safe sex, but you're in a big hurry.
[08:34.660 --> 08:37.400]  Now, you're going to want to have one of these preloaded and ready to go.
[08:37.760 --> 08:41.400]  But let's say the mood is struck and you're feeling it in the moment.
[08:41.480 --> 08:43.660]  You don't want to slow down to put...
[08:43.660 --> 08:45.840]  But you got to be safe, everybody.
[08:46.280 --> 08:47.940]  So you have one of these next to your bed.
[08:48.240 --> 08:49.960]  You just bend over. You say, I'm going to go to the bathroom real fast.
[08:50.080 --> 08:51.640]  You tell your significant other, your partner, whatever.
[08:51.940 --> 08:54.080]  And then you just run to the bathroom and you just go like...
[09:00.900 --> 09:01.740]  Safe. You're protected.
[09:02.000 --> 09:03.220]  I think we could go along with this.
[09:05.020 --> 09:06.000]  Well, I think we should try.
[09:09.880 --> 09:10.940]  Here, let me help you.
[09:14.990 --> 09:16.450]  Oh, I had it! It popped back out!
[09:16.590 --> 09:17.330]  All right, I'm going to hold it.
[09:17.330 --> 09:18.230]  It was too enthusiastic.
[09:24.970 --> 09:26.030]  Did you guys get that on camera?
[09:27.330 --> 09:28.230]  That was amazing.
[09:28.230 --> 09:29.210]  What happened?
[09:29.370 --> 09:30.610]  That was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
[09:30.950 --> 09:32.290]  It went right in the shot, right back out.
[09:33.250 --> 09:35.410]  We've invented like a little mini treble shea.
[09:37.630 --> 09:38.310]  All right, well.
[09:39.030 --> 09:39.510]  Close enough.
[09:39.810 --> 09:42.310]  I think it clearly does what it says it does.
[09:42.610 --> 09:43.230]  There you go.
[09:43.970 --> 09:44.550]  Sock slider.
[09:45.090 --> 09:46.450]  Put your socks on. Easy.
[09:46.770 --> 09:48.670]  Put your bread back in its basket. Make a pita.
[09:49.430 --> 09:50.390]  Use it for your dick.
[09:50.770 --> 09:51.350]  Sock slider.
[09:51.350 --> 09:51.430]  Here.
[09:56.950 --> 09:58.950]  Some lettuce somehow got in the hole.
[10:03.010 --> 10:11.310]  All right, well tune in next week when we take a look at the products that you've seen on the internet, television, and social media that you think,
[10:11.350 --> 10:13.210]  it must be too good to be true.
[10:13.330 --> 10:15.470]  My socks can't possibly slide that well.
[10:15.910 --> 10:17.190]  Well, maybe they can.
[10:17.310 --> 10:19.170]  And you'll find out on Does It Do?
