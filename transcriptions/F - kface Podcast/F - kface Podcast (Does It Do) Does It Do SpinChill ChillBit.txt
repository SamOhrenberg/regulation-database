[00:00.000 --> 00:04.080]  Alright, I'll see your primo family and I will raise you essence of pizza.
[00:06.960 --> 00:09.380]  Good luck with that. It's gonna be hard to do.
[00:11.780 --> 00:14.040]  Mr. Woolstreet, maybe? Are you serious?
[00:15.220 --> 00:15.700]  Now?
[00:17.360 --> 00:19.180]  It's been like five... fine.
[00:22.370 --> 00:23.210]  Alright, you're good.
[00:23.830 --> 00:27.070]  Hello and welcome to another episode of Does It Do?
[00:27.330 --> 00:30.290]  The show where we take the products you find on the internet,
[00:30.290 --> 00:35.270]  on television, or on social media that seem maybe a little too good to be true,
[00:35.650 --> 00:38.010]  and we test them out to determine the what, Gavin?
[00:39.050 --> 00:39.850]  The... huh?
[00:40.750 --> 00:44.130]  That's right. The what, the why, and the how does it do...
[00:45.610 --> 00:46.970]  what it's supposed to do, I guess?
[00:47.230 --> 00:50.830]  Yeah, you probably already know this. I'm sure you're huge fans of the show.
[00:51.190 --> 00:54.390]  But when we determine a product does what it says it does, in fact,
[00:54.570 --> 00:58.050]  we put it on the wall of dew over there.
[00:59.530 --> 01:03.530]  And if it doesn't do anything, it goes in the pile of... don't.
[01:04.130 --> 01:05.770]  Gavin, what do we have today?
[01:06.330 --> 01:08.610]  We have... the spaghetti.
[01:09.170 --> 01:11.210]  No, no, no, no. We do have spaghetti.
[01:11.530 --> 01:14.950]  What we have is the Spin Chill Chill Bit.
[01:15.250 --> 01:19.190]  Gavin, you ever drink in your soda and you think, I wish it was a little bit colder?
[01:19.510 --> 01:22.890]  But I don't want to wait 30 minutes for it to cool down in the fridge,
[01:23.050 --> 01:25.250]  or potentially in a bucket full of ice.
[01:25.510 --> 01:27.690]  That was a long question and I forgot the beginning of it.
[01:27.690 --> 01:28.310]  Yes.
[01:28.490 --> 01:30.630]  That's where the Spin Chill comes in.
[01:31.210 --> 01:34.690]  It's a drill bit that you affix to a drill.
[01:34.990 --> 01:36.330]  Here, let's do this. Let's try a new nipple.
[01:37.470 --> 01:38.270]  Oh, God!
[01:39.730 --> 01:40.370]  Spun that.
[01:40.990 --> 01:43.390]  Now, the way this sucker is supposed to work, get this...
[01:43.390 --> 01:45.870]  Would you agree this is a medium warm can?
[01:46.690 --> 01:48.470]  It's like extra medium warm.
[01:48.630 --> 01:50.670]  Yeah, it's like, it's not cold. You wouldn't have fun drinking it.
[01:51.970 --> 01:56.910]  Supposedly, put this puppy in ice and spin it for, I believe, one minute.
[01:58.430 --> 01:59.330]  Give me a countdown.
[02:00.610 --> 02:01.050]  One.
[02:04.090 --> 02:05.150]  That was just a count.
[02:05.810 --> 02:11.310]  Five, four, three, two, one.
[02:11.790 --> 02:12.670]  That was 30, right?
[02:12.810 --> 02:13.250]  Is it cold?
[02:14.190 --> 02:15.590]  It is actually cold.
[02:15.730 --> 02:17.270]  Oh, my Lord. Let's put it in for another look.
[02:17.590 --> 02:19.370]  It's almost as though I'm spinning some ice.
[02:20.490 --> 02:23.830]  I think the spinning action is supposed to make it colder faster.
[02:24.230 --> 02:27.390]  Do you think we should have put one in not spinning as a baseline?
[02:28.470 --> 02:30.150]  Yes, this is so cold now.
[02:30.410 --> 02:31.030]  Here's what we'll do.
[02:31.750 --> 02:32.570]  We have more.
[02:33.210 --> 02:34.690]  We have sodas for days, Gavin. Don't you worry.
[02:35.230 --> 02:38.430]  We got a spin soda and a control soda.
[02:44.630 --> 02:46.570]  It still spins when it's not attached.
[02:46.910 --> 02:48.590]  It does still spin when it's not attached.
[02:48.990 --> 02:50.190]  That's actually pretty fantastic.
[02:51.590 --> 02:53.090]  Okay, should we see?
[02:53.670 --> 02:54.270]  All right.
[02:55.610 --> 02:57.250]  All right, mixing them up.
[02:58.130 --> 02:59.090]  Which one's colder?
[03:01.410 --> 03:01.990]  This one.
[03:02.750 --> 03:03.690]  Well, that's the wrong one.
[03:06.430 --> 03:07.590]  Well, we've determined one thing.
[03:07.850 --> 03:08.870]  Ice makes drinks cold.
[03:09.290 --> 03:11.690]  I don't know that spinning it in the ice makes it any colder.
[03:11.790 --> 03:12.870]  It was definitely cold.
[03:19.140 --> 03:20.000]  Say you're at a party.
[03:20.220 --> 03:20.340]  Yeah.
[03:20.520 --> 03:24.220]  And you're like, hey, can I get you a Canada Dry?
[03:24.380 --> 03:25.420]  You're like, cool, I'll take one.
[03:25.660 --> 03:27.380]  You drink it for about a half an hour, 45 minutes.
[03:27.440 --> 03:27.940]  You set it aside.
[03:28.000 --> 03:28.840]  You forget about it.
[03:28.880 --> 03:29.060]  Right.
[03:29.100 --> 03:30.020]  You come back an hour later.
[03:30.420 --> 03:31.240]  You find your Canada Dry.
[03:31.280 --> 03:31.800]  It's warm.
[03:32.040 --> 03:32.500]  It's warm.
[03:32.860 --> 03:33.700]  You go to your party host.
[03:33.700 --> 03:34.780]  You got another Canada Dry.
[03:34.840 --> 03:35.500]  This one got warm.
[03:35.560 --> 03:36.220]  I was going to throw it away.
[03:36.280 --> 03:37.620]  And I say, hey, I'm the host.
[03:37.860 --> 03:38.660]  I said, don't throw that away.
[03:38.900 --> 03:39.320]  Oh, okay.
[03:39.440 --> 03:40.300]  You need to finish this.
[03:40.520 --> 03:40.900]  You just want it.
[03:40.940 --> 03:41.660]  You want to be a little cooler.
[03:41.860 --> 03:42.840]  I got the answer for you.
[03:43.120 --> 03:44.020]  Stick it on there.
[03:44.940 --> 03:46.440]  I'll refresh your drink for you.
[03:52.120 --> 03:52.820]  Try that.
[03:55.120 --> 03:56.360]  Thanks, host of the party.
[03:57.520 --> 03:58.240]  That's ideal.
[03:59.060 --> 04:00.440]  That's no longer lukewarm.
[04:00.740 --> 04:01.940]  Is it any colder than this?
[04:04.740 --> 04:05.980]  But that's the ideal temperature.
[04:06.380 --> 04:09.160]  If we're talking about two different temperatures, this is the one you want.
[04:09.480 --> 04:10.000]  What do you think, Gavin?
[04:10.040 --> 04:11.480]  Does it do what it says it does?
[04:12.080 --> 04:13.620]  I'm really on the fence about this.
[04:13.760 --> 04:15.080]  I think this definitely does.
[04:15.540 --> 04:16.720]  Yeah, the ice bucket does.
[04:17.460 --> 04:19.900]  Maybe we should try to determine some other things that it does.
[04:20.120 --> 04:20.320]  Okay.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.620]  For instance, I was making our dinner earlier.
[04:23.980 --> 04:24.240]  Yep.
[04:24.840 --> 04:25.520]  Caught off guard.
[04:26.260 --> 04:27.840]  Got a bunch of spaghetti noodles here.
[04:28.700 --> 04:29.320]  Give me a fork.
[04:30.140 --> 04:31.960]  Why do I feel like I should be wearing goggles?
[04:32.260 --> 04:32.780]  No, you're fine.
[04:32.900 --> 04:33.060]  Okay.
[04:33.380 --> 04:33.760]  In here.
[04:33.760 --> 04:37.780]  It's going to go from purely cleaning, keeping your drinks cold.
[04:38.740 --> 04:42.520]  It's going to become an easy to use kitchen tool.
[04:43.040 --> 04:45.940]  It's weird to be helping create the weapon that will injure you later.
[04:46.300 --> 04:46.800]  Here we go.
[04:47.180 --> 04:48.380]  All right, let's first test.
[04:48.600 --> 04:48.780]  Yeah.
[04:50.580 --> 04:54.820]  Is it a spin chill or a spaghetti spoon?
[04:55.760 --> 04:56.340]  Oh, boy.
[04:56.620 --> 04:56.640]  A spaghetti.
[04:57.060 --> 04:58.180]  Look at that go.
[04:58.360 --> 04:58.800]  Look at it.
[04:58.860 --> 05:00.320]  Look at it mix up your spaghetti.
[05:01.340 --> 05:02.300]  That's fantastic.
[05:02.300 --> 05:03.140]  Look at the steam.
[05:07.970 --> 05:09.290]  That's delicious, Geoff.
[05:09.530 --> 05:10.270]  Take it out.
[05:10.810 --> 05:11.890]  Turn it off before you take it out.
[05:12.070 --> 05:13.330]  Oh, that's so hot.
[05:14.530 --> 05:16.070]  It didn't make...
[05:16.070 --> 05:18.950]  Oh, maybe we can cool the spaghetti down.
[05:26.490 --> 05:28.110]  There's steam coming off it.
[05:28.330 --> 05:30.530]  I'd say it makes a reasonable spaghetti spinner.
[05:30.870 --> 05:30.970]  Can I try?
[05:31.230 --> 05:31.490]  Yeah.
[05:32.370 --> 05:33.390]  There's tons of spaghetti left.
[05:34.090 --> 05:36.050]  Maybe speed isn't the answer for this.
[05:37.090 --> 05:37.930]  Oh, it sort of has a...
[05:39.310 --> 05:41.310]  If you do it slowly, sort of like slowly...
[05:43.530 --> 05:45.330]  I feel like it's lost its grip.
[05:46.590 --> 05:48.550]  This could kill anyone in this room.
[05:53.200 --> 05:54.820]  I have another idea, Gavin.
[05:55.240 --> 05:55.500]  Yeah.
[05:55.600 --> 05:55.900]  All right.
[05:55.980 --> 05:57.840]  I think we've proven it definitely does that.
[05:58.700 --> 05:59.140]  Let's...
[05:59.140 --> 05:59.700]  Gavin?
[06:00.040 --> 06:00.260]  Yeah.
[06:00.700 --> 06:01.420]  You ever...
[06:01.420 --> 06:02.780]  You ever play with your doll?
[06:03.500 --> 06:04.620]  I thought you're going to say something else.
[06:04.700 --> 06:04.840]  Yeah.
[06:04.920 --> 06:05.240]  No.
[06:05.240 --> 06:06.320]  You like your doll.
[06:07.300 --> 06:08.720]  You want to braid her hair.
[06:11.060 --> 06:12.740]  But you're not good at braiding hair.
[06:14.120 --> 06:14.860]  Oh, man.
[06:16.220 --> 06:17.460]  It's going to be a blood puff.
[06:17.640 --> 06:18.760]  Here, you hold the doll.
[06:18.860 --> 06:19.000]  Yeah.
[06:19.920 --> 06:21.280]  Just a little tape to get her started.
[06:21.660 --> 06:22.360]  That there.
[06:23.540 --> 06:25.780]  And then we'll do this on...
[06:25.780 --> 06:26.240]  How does it...
[06:26.240 --> 06:27.540]  This is the way it goes.
[06:27.960 --> 06:28.560]  Speed braiding.
[06:28.700 --> 06:28.860]  Yeah.
[06:28.940 --> 06:29.180]  You ready?
[06:30.240 --> 06:30.760]  Wait, wait.
[06:31.360 --> 06:31.720]  Yeah.
[06:31.920 --> 06:32.120]  You ready?
[06:32.300 --> 06:32.480]  Yep.
[06:34.080 --> 06:34.800]  All right, let her go.
[06:34.800 --> 06:34.960]  Yep.
[06:43.180 --> 06:43.580]  Yeah.
[06:45.180 --> 06:49.000]  And just like that, your doll's got beautifully braided.
[06:49.060 --> 06:49.580]  Look at that.
[06:50.220 --> 06:50.820]  Look at that.
[06:51.900 --> 06:53.240]  Dads, look at that.
[06:53.400 --> 06:57.300]  If you're like me, a single father couldn't make the marriage stick.
[06:57.920 --> 06:59.640]  Got to braid your kid's hair all on your own.
[07:00.320 --> 07:02.420]  Consider the spin and chill.
[07:02.840 --> 07:04.160]  I don't think we're done yet though, Gavin.
[07:04.240 --> 07:06.120]  I feel like there's more we can do with this thing.
[07:06.700 --> 07:08.660]  So what we have here, Gavin, is a little pocket fan.
[07:08.660 --> 07:10.540]  Everybody loves a pocket fan, especially on a hot day.
[07:10.640 --> 07:11.400]  Say you're at a theme park.
[07:11.440 --> 07:12.580]  I know people love theme parks.
[07:13.120 --> 07:14.520]  So now you're like, oh, I'm standing in line.
[07:14.640 --> 07:14.860]  I gotta...
[07:15.520 --> 07:16.180]  It helps.
[07:16.460 --> 07:16.940]  It helps.
[07:17.020 --> 07:17.400]  But it's...
[07:17.400 --> 07:18.140]  I'm in Florida.
[07:18.820 --> 07:19.380]  It's July.
[07:19.640 --> 07:21.500]  It's 110 degrees outside.
[07:21.700 --> 07:23.180]  Oh, I'd say that's helping a medium amount.
[07:23.240 --> 07:24.860]  The humidity is off the charts.
[07:24.960 --> 07:27.380]  You're just moving sweat around on your face at this point.
[07:27.740 --> 07:29.300]  We need to supercharge this fan.
[07:29.640 --> 07:34.020]  I cannot wait because I feel really good about this one, Gavin.
[07:34.320 --> 07:35.180]  All right, we'll turn her on.
[07:36.820 --> 07:37.220]  Yep.
[07:37.820 --> 07:38.340]  Whoa!
[07:49.280 --> 07:51.100]  But hey, maybe this will cool you down.
[07:52.560 --> 07:54.300]  I think that's a live wire now.
[07:56.760 --> 07:58.900]  All right, definitely doesn't do that.
[07:59.140 --> 08:05.880]  You know, with NFTs and digital art and AIs making crazy art and stuff,
[08:06.040 --> 08:11.400]  I feel like the craftsmanship of creating art is getting lost by the wayside,
[08:11.740 --> 08:13.960]  thanks to clever technology tricks.
[08:13.960 --> 08:16.400]  But we can have some clever tricks of our own, right, Gav?
[08:16.680 --> 08:18.240]  Like, what if we took a...
[08:20.820 --> 08:21.540]  Yeah, paintbrush.
[08:22.980 --> 08:24.260]  Let's affix this puppy.
[08:24.400 --> 08:25.700]  Maybe the next Damien Hirst.
[08:26.220 --> 08:27.060]  What's your favorite color, Gavin?
[08:27.220 --> 08:27.560]  Blue.
[08:27.920 --> 08:28.740]  Okay, pink it is.
[08:29.140 --> 08:30.560]  This is probably my second favorite.
[08:30.980 --> 08:32.460]  I wish I wasn't wearing my new Air Jordans.
[08:33.580 --> 08:36.080]  All right, that's gonna go...
[08:36.080 --> 08:36.920]  Okay, why don't you...
[08:36.920 --> 08:37.440]  If we...
[08:37.440 --> 08:38.180]  Should we go on top?
[08:38.380 --> 08:38.960]  Would that be better?
[08:39.540 --> 08:39.940]  Let's see.
[08:41.900 --> 08:42.260]  Oh!
[08:50.400 --> 08:51.780]  Okay, so that was your bit.
[08:56.420 --> 08:58.900]  Oh my god, I can see it happening!
[09:02.400 --> 09:03.720]  Okay, that was pretty good.
[09:03.920 --> 09:04.620]  There's a teal.
[09:06.260 --> 09:08.820]  I think I just stared into my own death briefly there,
[09:08.900 --> 09:10.680]  but I think that's what art is sometimes.
[09:11.300 --> 09:12.140]  Sign your name at the bottom.
[09:14.220 --> 09:14.660]  G...
[09:27.580 --> 09:28.600]  Well, there you have it!
[09:28.620 --> 09:29.900]  Did you see how high that went?
[09:29.900 --> 09:34.400]  The SpinChill doesn't spin your soda any colder than a bucket of ice,
[09:34.700 --> 09:36.280]  but it does a whole lot more.
[09:37.100 --> 09:39.960]  Gavin, I think this puppy belongs in the pile of dew.
[09:40.080 --> 09:40.620]  I would agree.
[09:41.020 --> 09:42.380]  It just went like a bird.
[09:42.600 --> 09:43.560]  It went up.
