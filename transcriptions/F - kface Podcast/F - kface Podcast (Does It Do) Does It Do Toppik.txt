[00:00.000 --> 00:04.420]  Does It Do Season 2, made possible by our friends at Shady Rays.
[00:05.540 --> 00:05.980]  Boop!
[00:06.700 --> 00:10.440]  All right, welcome to Does It Do Season 2, Episode 2.
[00:10.660 --> 00:14.180]  As you know, things have gotten a little off the rails this season already, as you know.
[00:14.260 --> 00:15.140]  What's going on there?
[00:15.200 --> 00:16.580]  Well, this is a cool season.
[00:16.860 --> 00:18.940]  So we've got, uh, we got...
[00:19.840 --> 00:22.480]  Oh, sorry, popped my collar, got my cool hair.
[00:22.700 --> 00:25.260]  Today we're going to be taking a look at Topic.
[00:25.600 --> 00:28.800]  Gavin, you're familiar with male pattern baldness.
[00:28.800 --> 00:30.120]  Look at this, Geoff.
[00:30.720 --> 00:32.660]  Oh, that's, uh, way better than what I got going on.
[00:32.900 --> 00:37.680]  Unfortunately, for guys like you and I, life is pretty much just over from this point.
[00:37.820 --> 00:42.180]  You lose more and more hair and relevance and value to society,
[00:42.320 --> 00:46.420]  and then you waste away and you die alone.
[00:46.740 --> 00:47.720]  You end up looking like that.
[00:48.060 --> 00:51.240]  We here at Does It Do, does it do, uh, what?
[00:51.520 --> 00:51.960]  Uniform.
[00:52.240 --> 00:54.460]  Combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm.
[00:54.580 --> 00:55.020]  Uniform.
[00:55.020 --> 01:00.720]  Our charge with determining, does Topic do what it says it does?
[01:00.840 --> 01:01.900]  And Gavin, how are we going to do that?
[01:03.420 --> 01:03.900]  That's right.
[01:04.120 --> 01:06.580]  The who, the who, the what, and the how.
[01:06.740 --> 01:09.220]  Does it do what it says it does?
[01:10.040 --> 01:10.680]  You dodging them?
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.400]  It's kind of getting out of the way of these words.
[01:12.920 --> 01:13.960]  Yeah, I think I, well...
[01:13.960 --> 01:15.660]  Gavin, when I was a younger man...
[01:16.600 --> 01:17.480]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:17.500 --> 01:18.880]  I'll take my glasses off and get serious for a second.
[01:19.040 --> 01:20.500]  I didn't have a lot going on in my life.
[01:20.500 --> 01:25.820]  But one thing I did have, I had the prettiest eyebrows in my town.
[01:26.680 --> 01:27.640]  I was the eyebrow guy.
[01:27.900 --> 01:30.860]  And then as I got older and I developed my career and I,
[01:31.220 --> 01:34.400]  at some point, became in charge of you and a few other idiots.
[01:34.760 --> 01:38.160]  Through stress, I rubbed my eyebrows away over about eight years.
[01:38.380 --> 01:39.520]  And now they're just gone.
[01:39.720 --> 01:40.500]  You took them from me.
[01:40.740 --> 01:42.380]  And so I got to get them back.
[01:42.700 --> 01:48.120]  Okay, so let's make sure not to get anywhere other than the eyebrows.
[01:48.120 --> 01:50.460]  Please change the course of my life.
[01:51.200 --> 01:59.200]  Give me back the eyebrows that so promised a future full of...
[01:59.200 --> 02:00.560]  Why are you already laughing?
[02:01.540 --> 02:03.300]  Well, you've got a lot of chocolate on that.
[02:03.860 --> 02:05.940]  This is a messy, this is a sticky table.
[02:06.400 --> 02:08.900]  Okay, so I'd say that's the area that we want to focus on.
[02:09.140 --> 02:10.540]  Now we have three different colors.
[02:11.160 --> 02:13.020]  I'm, we have yellow, auburn and black.
[02:13.100 --> 02:14.260]  I'm probably closest to black.
[02:14.340 --> 02:14.900]  You're pretty dark.
[02:15.020 --> 02:16.940]  Yeah, so, and then I, so just...
[02:18.120 --> 02:19.180]  It's, oh, wow.
[02:19.400 --> 02:19.800]  Okay, you ready?
[02:20.040 --> 02:20.560]  I think so.
[02:21.140 --> 02:22.200]  Probably less is more.
[02:22.540 --> 02:22.700]  Yeah.
[02:28.650 --> 02:29.530]  That's one done.
[02:29.630 --> 02:30.510]  That's looking great.
[02:30.810 --> 02:33.030]  I'm imagining that scene in Mrs. Doubtfire where he like,
[02:33.470 --> 02:35.390]  he peppers the lobster to kill James Bond.
[02:37.150 --> 02:38.450]  Okay, I think we're good.
[02:38.530 --> 02:39.990]  So now I'm going to take off the masking.
[02:40.330 --> 02:41.070]  Just rip it off.
[02:41.870 --> 02:42.470]  That's my eyelid.
[02:43.650 --> 02:44.810]  Don't rip the eyelid off.
[02:49.970 --> 02:51.550]  Gavin, be honest with me.
[02:51.890 --> 02:53.710]  Did you turn back the hands of time?
[02:54.530 --> 02:58.110]  Am I a young, am I a young 19 year old with little eyebrows again?
[03:00.650 --> 03:02.000]  Okay, you can sit up now.
[03:13.570 --> 03:14.550]  I'm gonna shit.
[03:16.330 --> 03:16.790]  Ladies?
[03:17.270 --> 03:18.450]  Oh, I just got married too.
[03:18.990 --> 03:19.890]  Oh, dang.
[03:19.970 --> 03:20.910]  I could have had this at the wedding.
[03:21.250 --> 03:22.530]  I would have looked so good.
[03:23.090 --> 03:23.370]  Yeah.
[03:24.710 --> 03:26.730]  You look like your own GTA character.
[03:29.190 --> 03:30.230]  Hey Jake, Mr. Herman.
[03:31.470 --> 03:33.550]  Well, that worked surprisingly well.
[03:33.590 --> 03:33.910]  Really good.
[03:33.950 --> 03:35.050]  But let's see if it does other stuff.
[03:35.170 --> 03:38.370]  Like, you know, a lot of people, a lot of people like to make cakes.
[03:38.590 --> 03:38.970]  That's true.
[03:39.070 --> 03:41.650]  And I hear, like I'm in the video game industry, right?
[03:42.170 --> 03:44.290]  Making hair is the hardest part in a video game.
[03:44.570 --> 03:46.290]  I hear it's difficult in cakes, that kind of stuff.
[03:46.530 --> 03:48.950]  What if we could help revolutionize the cooking industry as well?
[03:49.450 --> 03:50.430]  So we got this cake.
[03:53.850 --> 03:55.130]  Oh, oh my god.
[03:56.350 --> 03:56.790]  All icing.
[03:57.030 --> 03:57.790]  We'll make a face.
[03:58.090 --> 04:01.490]  So there's a guy, but he needs a beard and hair.
[04:03.410 --> 04:05.310]  And is this a food safe product?
[04:05.530 --> 04:06.050]  I assume so.
[04:06.130 --> 04:07.190]  It goes in your face, dude.
[04:09.190 --> 04:10.010]  Just like that.
[04:17.460 --> 04:18.940]  I think it works better on real heads.
[04:19.120 --> 04:19.260]  Yeah.
[04:19.540 --> 04:23.160]  Do you think if you head-butted the cake, the eyebrows would transfer onto the face?
[04:23.940 --> 04:24.480]  I do.
[04:26.760 --> 04:29.240]  Oh my god.
[04:30.360 --> 04:31.460]  Okay, that was...
[04:32.560 --> 04:34.600]  He gave me eyebrows.
[04:49.260 --> 04:50.760]  Worked too well.
[04:53.420 --> 04:54.780]  That's the thumbnail.
[04:55.340 --> 04:56.880]  It's just like me.
[05:01.420 --> 05:02.140]  Oh.
[05:02.320 --> 05:03.180]  Oh, that's a...
[05:03.180 --> 05:04.700]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[05:04.760 --> 05:05.680]  That was...
[05:05.680 --> 05:06.680]  Oh my god.
[05:06.960 --> 05:10.700]  Does It Do season two made possible by our friends at Shady Rays.
[05:10.700 --> 05:14.140]  The future's so bright, you need a new pair of shades.
[05:14.420 --> 05:20.340]  From sunrise to sunset, our friends at Shady Rays have you covered with premium polarized
[05:20.340 --> 05:21.780]  shades that won't break the bank.
[05:21.840 --> 05:24.500]  I'm using hand gestures to really emphasize the points.
[05:24.700 --> 05:28.760]  Shady Rays is an independent sunglass company that offers a world-class product,
[05:28.860 --> 05:33.640]  this one right here, that is just as good as any expensive pair of sunglasses we've ever worn.
[05:33.940 --> 05:37.740]  And they are on a mission to match durability with affordability.
[05:37.740 --> 05:40.980]  I've been wearing Shady Rays basically since I met those people.
[05:41.420 --> 05:42.320]  And I love them.
[05:42.420 --> 05:43.540]  I ride my bike every day.
[05:43.700 --> 05:44.620]  I put my Shady Rays on.
[05:44.660 --> 05:47.340]  It keeps my eyeballs safe from the sun and from stuff flying up at me.
[05:47.400 --> 05:48.080]  Picture this.
[05:48.440 --> 05:49.680]  You're wearing your shades.
[05:49.960 --> 05:51.360]  You're feeling like a million bucks.
[05:51.420 --> 05:53.820]  Although in 2023, a million bucks is really like...
[05:53.820 --> 05:55.380]  You're feeling like 400,000 bucks.
[05:55.780 --> 05:56.900]  And then life happens.
[05:57.280 --> 05:58.040]  You drop them.
[05:58.160 --> 05:59.000]  You sit on them.
[05:59.280 --> 06:01.340]  Maybe your dog thinks they're a new chew toy.
[06:01.500 --> 06:01.980]  It sucks.
[06:02.100 --> 06:02.580]  I get it.
[06:02.700 --> 06:03.560]  Shady Rays gets it.
[06:03.760 --> 06:04.860]  That's why they've got your back.
[06:04.860 --> 06:09.540]  If you lose or break your pair, even on day one, they're going to send you a brand new pair.
[06:09.880 --> 06:10.860]  No questions asked.
[06:10.920 --> 06:15.140]  And if you don't love your shades, you can exchange them or even return them for free
[06:15.780 --> 06:16.940]  within 30 days.
[06:17.100 --> 06:18.480]  There's no risk when you shop.
[06:18.560 --> 06:21.660]  Their team always has your back with personal and fast support.
[06:21.800 --> 06:28.700]  Head to ShadyRays.com and use code DOESITDO for 50% off two or more pairs of polarized sunglasses.
[06:29.060 --> 06:30.600]  That's not a polarizing offer.
[06:30.660 --> 06:31.500]  That's just a good offer.
[06:31.500 --> 06:32.520]  Try it for yourself.
[06:32.620 --> 06:35.800]  The shades rated five stars by over 250,000 people.
[06:35.900 --> 06:37.460]  As a matter of fact, get a pair for yourself.
[06:37.780 --> 06:42.080]  Then get a second pair for your cake.
[06:43.820 --> 06:44.660]  We look good.
[06:44.780 --> 06:50.080]  Well, we've seen that we can improve eyebrows.
[06:50.300 --> 06:52.400]  We can improve... look at my eyebrows are still mostly there.
[06:52.480 --> 06:53.060]  Yeah, that's mostly there.
[06:53.120 --> 06:54.160]  Those are small improvements.
[06:54.280 --> 06:54.780]  Those are small fixes.
[06:54.880 --> 06:58.400]  We need something more grand to try it on, right?
[06:59.000 --> 06:59.940]  Can we get that mannequin in?
[07:02.820 --> 07:03.620]  Goggle me.
[07:04.180 --> 07:05.780]  You look like a distinguished gentleman.
[07:05.980 --> 07:08.280]  Probably have a sophisticated name.
[07:08.560 --> 07:09.260]  Would you like to know it?
[07:10.460 --> 07:11.960]  It's Geoff with a G.
[07:12.840 --> 07:14.480]  You know, there's so few of us in the world.
[07:14.920 --> 07:16.300]  I'm just saying no, not at all.
[07:16.540 --> 07:19.600]  You're a follicly challenged individual.
[07:19.880 --> 07:20.460]  Is it obvious?
[07:20.860 --> 07:22.100]  Are you able to tell?
[07:22.140 --> 07:22.560]  It is.
[07:22.740 --> 07:23.680]  Gavin's gonna go ahead and get to work.
[07:24.080 --> 07:27.240]  But when you did have hair, what color was it?
[07:27.540 --> 07:29.820]  It was flaming orange, bright red.
[07:29.820 --> 07:32.220]  Although, you know, it actually is more of a brownish.
[07:32.560 --> 07:33.400]  Okay, we'll go with auburn.
[07:33.580 --> 07:36.320]  So we're gonna see if what we can do to give you maybe like a mohawk?
[07:36.600 --> 07:37.220]  I think...
[07:37.220 --> 07:37.980]  When was the last time you got a mohawk?
[07:37.980 --> 07:38.960]  Can we do the Rufio?
[07:39.160 --> 07:40.080]  Like the three stripes?
[07:40.400 --> 07:41.120]  Is that all right?
[07:41.560 --> 07:41.980]  I mean...
[07:41.980 --> 07:42.960]  Gavin, you've done this before.
[07:43.580 --> 07:45.000]  You've got the hot hands to skill sport.
[07:45.140 --> 07:45.340]  All right.
[07:45.480 --> 07:46.640]  So I'm just gonna mohawk this.
[07:46.800 --> 07:47.260]  Mohawk it.
[07:47.600 --> 07:48.200]  Don't be shy.
[07:49.580 --> 07:51.540]  I think someone will finally, finally attract you.
[07:51.780 --> 07:52.960]  All right, well, we need it.
[07:53.720 --> 07:55.680]  That's clearly the wrong shade.
[07:56.600 --> 07:57.680]  Okay, now we're looking.
[07:58.000 --> 07:59.180]  Maybe I'll go all over with this.
[07:59.180 --> 08:01.220]  And then the mohawk can be the black over the middle.
[08:01.520 --> 08:02.240]  I see, I see.
[08:02.540 --> 08:03.680]  Like it's more of a textural thing.
[08:04.820 --> 08:05.820]  Okay, yeah, yeah.
[08:06.660 --> 08:08.200]  I'm starting to feel like I take on the world.
[08:09.120 --> 08:09.600]  All right, all right.
[08:09.660 --> 08:10.120]  Tilt the other way.
[08:10.380 --> 08:10.700]  All right.
[08:13.020 --> 08:13.980]  I gotta say...
[08:14.720 --> 08:15.580]  Is it looking good?
[08:16.820 --> 08:17.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[08:17.520 --> 08:18.220]  All right, that's probably good.
[08:18.260 --> 08:19.280]  Let's take the glasses off.
[08:19.320 --> 08:20.020]  Okay, all right.
[08:20.060 --> 08:20.740]  Let's get rid of the tape.
[08:20.920 --> 08:21.920]  Okay, all right.
[08:23.420 --> 08:23.740]  Wow.
[08:24.740 --> 08:25.100]  Wow.
[08:30.220 --> 08:30.960]  That's the one?
[08:31.260 --> 08:31.280]  Yeah.
[08:31.380 --> 08:31.980]  I mean, it feels...
[08:33.900 --> 08:34.620]  I don't know.
[08:35.500 --> 08:36.460]  All right, here's the deal.
[08:37.700 --> 08:39.340]  Is it supposed to shake off like that?
[08:39.380 --> 08:41.680]  If I would, there's going to be a little bit of excess residue.
[08:42.300 --> 08:43.980]  Conditionally, I would say this has worked.
[08:44.440 --> 08:46.240]  Here's how I, here's how I would preface it.
[08:46.540 --> 08:47.380]  Don't go outside in the rain.
[08:47.680 --> 08:47.980]  Okay.
[08:48.260 --> 08:51.620]  Don't get within six to seven feet of people you know.
[08:51.740 --> 08:51.980]  Okay.
[08:52.260 --> 08:53.120]  I think you've defined.
[08:53.120 --> 08:54.140]  From a distance, it works?
[08:54.240 --> 08:55.200]  I think from a distance, it works very well.
[08:55.220 --> 08:55.920]  Got a Bette Midler song?
[08:56.100 --> 08:57.760]  Why don't I let you know when it's working for me?
[08:57.820 --> 08:58.680]  If you just back away.
[08:58.840 --> 08:58.960]  All right.
[09:01.120 --> 09:01.760]  Yep, keep...
[09:01.760 --> 09:02.560]  Not yet?
[09:02.720 --> 09:03.000]  Keep going.
[09:03.200 --> 09:03.580]  Keep going?
[09:05.240 --> 09:05.800]  Not yet?
[09:06.520 --> 09:07.300]  Oh, maybe there.
[09:07.480 --> 09:07.900]  Is it...
[09:07.900 --> 09:08.860]  A little bit further.
[09:09.040 --> 09:09.420]  Is it here?
[09:09.800 --> 09:10.380]  A little bit further.
[09:10.480 --> 09:10.780]  From here?
[09:11.040 --> 09:11.240]  Yep.
[09:12.080 --> 09:12.340]  Working?
[09:12.720 --> 09:13.040]  Now?
[09:13.520 --> 09:14.160]  Yeah, there we go.
[09:14.200 --> 09:14.800]  Now, is it good?
[09:15.060 --> 09:15.840]  That looks great.
[09:15.900 --> 09:17.000]  Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
[09:17.180 --> 09:17.480]  Take care.
[09:17.620 --> 09:19.140]  This might be the best pro we've ever used.
[09:19.260 --> 09:20.160]  That's a whole lot of success.
[09:20.280 --> 09:20.420]  Yeah.
[09:20.420 --> 09:24.480]  We've proven that we can replace missing eyebrows.
[09:24.740 --> 09:27.160]  We've proven that from a distance, you can replace a head of hair.
[09:27.920 --> 09:28.440]  About 12 feet.
[09:28.640 --> 09:28.740]  Yeah.
[09:28.940 --> 09:31.440]  And we've proven that you can decorate a cake.
[09:32.060 --> 09:32.860]  What about movies?
[09:33.020 --> 09:33.840]  What about practical effects?
[09:33.880 --> 09:34.480]  What about Hollywood?
[09:34.980 --> 09:37.800]  So everything CGI these days are the Marvel movies, right?
[09:38.180 --> 09:38.840]  But those aren't.
[09:39.560 --> 09:40.100]  These are real.
[09:40.120 --> 09:40.420]  That's real.
[09:41.760 --> 09:42.920]  You ever learned to be a wolfman?
[09:43.360 --> 09:43.580]  Yeah.
[09:58.350 --> 09:59.390]  Hold on, I need to breathe.
[10:02.410 --> 10:03.110]  Back at it.
[10:05.470 --> 10:06.050]  Oh, shit.
[10:07.750 --> 10:08.750]  Got a little close on that one.
[10:08.770 --> 10:08.990]  Keep going.
[10:09.310 --> 10:09.650]  You're good.
[10:10.250 --> 10:11.030]  Gotta watch out for that.
[10:14.770 --> 10:15.830]  Okay, I think you're good.
[10:18.550 --> 10:20.010]  It's Lon Chaney himself.
[10:23.290 --> 10:24.670]  All right, I gotta be honest with you.
[10:25.070 --> 10:26.110]  I don't think that one worked.
[10:26.670 --> 10:28.050]  That being said, Gavin...
[10:29.630 --> 10:33.810]  ...we've proven you can give a bald man a full head of hair from 12 feet.
[10:34.370 --> 10:35.030]  With topic.
[10:35.670 --> 10:36.230]  Does it do?
[10:36.470 --> 10:37.530]  It does.
[10:38.310 --> 10:40.810]  We're gonna put it in the Hall of Do.
[10:48.420 --> 10:50.020]  It smells spicy.
[10:52.920 --> 10:55.680]  We'll see you next time on Does It Do?
[10:55.680 --> 10:59.840]  Oh, shit.
