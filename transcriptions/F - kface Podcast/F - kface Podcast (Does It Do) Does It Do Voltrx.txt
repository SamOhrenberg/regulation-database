[00:08.850 --> 00:09.250]  Storage...
[00:11.170 --> 00:13.750]  Has anyone seen this charger? This cable?
[00:16.830 --> 00:19.710]  I'm Geoff and I'm an employee of Uniform.
[00:19.830 --> 00:22.950]  Uniform. Combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm. Uniform.
[00:23.150 --> 00:25.390]  And with me, as always, my handy assistant Gavin.
[00:25.670 --> 00:28.270]  We're science guys and Uniform.
[00:28.390 --> 00:31.110]  Uniform. Combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm. Uniform.
[00:31.250 --> 00:35.290]  Employs us to take a look at some of the fantastic products
[00:35.290 --> 00:38.670]  we see on the internet, on social media, on the television.
[00:38.950 --> 00:41.930]  Products that seem like maybe they're a little too good to be true.
[00:42.570 --> 00:44.370]  So we take a look at them and we determine,
[00:44.730 --> 00:47.450]  do they do what they say they do?
[00:47.610 --> 00:49.230]  And Gavin, what's the pattern we follow?
[00:49.450 --> 00:50.030]  The huh?
[00:50.570 --> 00:54.950]  That's right. The who, the why, and the what do they do?
[00:55.510 --> 00:56.630]  Does it season two?
[00:57.330 --> 01:02.730]  Made possible by our friends at Shady Rays.
[01:03.850 --> 01:05.950]  What if season two?
[01:07.630 --> 01:08.710]  Oh, color up.
[01:09.850 --> 01:10.370]  Voltrax.
[01:11.570 --> 01:14.890]  Alright, so what they say this does, Gavin, I had to look at the box.
[01:15.270 --> 01:17.030]  It's supposed to make protein shakes.
[01:17.430 --> 01:18.990]  BPA free, I hear that's good.
[01:19.110 --> 01:19.710]  That's my uncle.
[01:19.930 --> 01:20.490]  Shadow resistant?
[01:25.470 --> 01:25.850]  Eh.
[01:26.190 --> 01:26.910]  Water resistant?
[01:29.490 --> 01:30.370]  Oh no.
[01:31.950 --> 01:33.610]  Look at that sucker go.
[01:34.470 --> 01:35.730]  Alright, let's get all of them going.
[01:38.410 --> 01:40.090]  Oh, that one makes a noise.
[01:40.430 --> 01:42.730]  We need more fluid. They don't stay on long enough.
[01:45.410 --> 01:45.850]  Cheers.
[01:51.230 --> 01:52.910]  It's hard to drink out of a whirlpool.
[01:54.750 --> 01:57.910]  Well, it definitely mixes water, disperses water.
[01:58.150 --> 01:59.990]  What we like to mix up, and it does it differently,
[01:59.990 --> 02:01.830]  What we like to do here, you got your go-to's.
[02:01.830 --> 02:06.330]  You know how like everybody on the internet, they use a banana for scale when they're measuring things.
[02:06.630 --> 02:09.690]  Well here at Does It Do, we use spaghetti for scale.
[02:10.050 --> 02:15.910]  There's nothing worse than when you get your spaghetti, and your noodles don't get fully coated.
[02:16.690 --> 02:17.650]  You know what I mean?
[02:17.990 --> 02:19.650]  Like you got all these delicious noodles.
[02:20.270 --> 02:21.410]  I'll get some sauce going.
[02:25.860 --> 02:27.520]  Yeah, get that good and mixed up.
[02:27.840 --> 02:28.820]  How do we do this?
[02:28.820 --> 02:31.220]  Oh, well I can transfer from this into...
[02:31.220 --> 02:31.480]  Yeah, okay.
[02:35.770 --> 02:37.150]  I'm gonna run out of room here pretty quick.
[02:37.430 --> 02:37.810]  Is that on?
[02:39.570 --> 02:40.670]  Let me try this again.
[02:42.010 --> 02:42.730]  Less is more.
[02:43.610 --> 02:45.250]  It doesn't take much to gum up the works.
[02:45.350 --> 02:46.190]  What about one at a time?
[02:46.390 --> 02:49.290]  One singular healthy strand of spag.
[02:51.970 --> 02:52.990]  Oh! Look at that!
[02:53.070 --> 02:53.970]  We can put sauce on that.
[02:54.870 --> 02:59.170]  That might have been too much for it.
[03:01.570 --> 03:02.850]  Oh, that's good though.
[03:02.970 --> 03:04.510]  The frickin' noise!
[03:05.030 --> 03:07.050]  So you just gotta make spaghetti by the bite.
[03:07.150 --> 03:07.590]  You wanna try some?
[03:08.070 --> 03:08.970]  That's all yours, that one.
[03:16.480 --> 03:17.280]  That's a good spaghetti.
[03:18.160 --> 03:19.020]  I gotta be honest with you.
[03:19.340 --> 03:20.940]  I'm not blown away by the spaghetti mixing.
[03:21.120 --> 03:23.800]  This would be pretty bad in an industrial environment.
[03:24.160 --> 03:26.640]  If you got a restaurant, you wouldn't wanna do your spaghetti this way.
[03:26.700 --> 03:28.280]  What about something a little less gummy?
[03:28.700 --> 03:28.920]  Yep.
[03:29.220 --> 03:34.580]  You know how when you eat your cereal, but your milk and your cereal just don't mix?
[03:34.580 --> 03:34.840]  Yeah.
[03:35.160 --> 03:36.200]  It's like the worst.
[03:37.400 --> 03:38.540]  Oh, and it makes it smaller!
[03:39.900 --> 03:40.240]  Wow!
[03:41.060 --> 03:42.660]  Yeah, throw some of that in there.
[03:44.080 --> 03:44.760]  Alright, that's enough.
[03:45.640 --> 03:47.360]  And then maybe it can carry a few more now.
[03:48.280 --> 03:48.980]  There we go.
[03:57.370 --> 03:59.330]  You're sort of having to do a lot of the manual work.
[04:00.070 --> 04:00.930]  Carry the pizza to purpose.
[04:01.010 --> 04:01.170]  Yeah.
[04:01.770 --> 04:02.850]  And then into the bowl.
[04:02.930 --> 04:03.370]  Here, have that.
[04:07.010 --> 04:07.570]  It's breakfast.
[04:09.370 --> 04:11.070]  It's the most important meal of the day.
[04:13.090 --> 04:14.430]  You're lactose intolerant, right?
[04:14.570 --> 04:15.230]  No, I love it.
[04:18.010 --> 04:18.910]  Lactose is your favorite?
[04:19.270 --> 04:20.070]  Where could I put this?
[04:20.690 --> 04:21.350]  In your mouth.
[04:21.850 --> 04:22.630]  This is luxurious.
[04:24.170 --> 04:24.770]  That's gross.
[04:26.490 --> 04:27.770]  Alright, I gotta be honest with you.
[04:27.810 --> 04:28.730]  I'm not impressed with that either.
[04:29.050 --> 04:30.530]  Doesn't Do Season 2.
[04:30.770 --> 04:33.150]  Made possible by our friends at...
[04:34.230 --> 04:35.030]  Shady Rays.
[04:35.030 --> 04:38.770]  Future so bright, you need a new pair of shades.
[04:39.050 --> 04:42.910]  From sunrise to sunset, you need a new pair of shades.
[04:43.170 --> 04:47.110]  Our friends at Shady Rays have you covered with premium shades.
[04:47.190 --> 04:48.650]  They're polarized shades.
[04:48.770 --> 04:50.430]  They won't break the shade bank.
[04:50.790 --> 04:54.850]  Shady Rays is an independent sunglass company that offers a world class product
[04:54.850 --> 04:59.410]  that's just as good as any expensive pair of shades we've ever worn.
[04:59.730 --> 05:03.910]  They're on a mission to match the durability and affordability of your shades.
[05:03.910 --> 05:05.850]  So picture this. You're wearing your shades.
[05:06.130 --> 05:07.450]  Feel like a million bucks.
[05:07.750 --> 05:08.770]  Looking good.
[05:09.010 --> 05:11.270]  And then life happens. You drop them.
[05:11.470 --> 05:12.170]  You sit on them.
[05:12.450 --> 05:14.850]  Somebody throws Caesar dressing in your face.
[05:14.930 --> 05:17.470]  Maybe your dog thinks they found a new chew toy.
[05:17.610 --> 05:18.190]  It sucks.
[05:18.550 --> 05:21.690]  But hey, Shady Rays has got your back.
[05:21.810 --> 05:23.550]  The company is like a superhero of eyewear.
[05:23.990 --> 05:25.350]  I can't read with glasses on.
[05:25.370 --> 05:26.690]  With lost and broken replacements.
[05:26.950 --> 05:29.590]  If you lose or break your pair, even on day one,
[05:29.690 --> 05:31.070]  and you won't, but even if you do,
[05:31.070 --> 05:33.030]  they tell us they'll send you a brand new pair,
[05:33.110 --> 05:34.230]  no questions asked.
[05:34.350 --> 05:36.990]  If you don't love your shades, exchange or return them for free
[05:36.990 --> 05:38.710]  within 30 days.
[05:38.910 --> 05:40.130]  There's no risk when you shop.

[05:42.730 --> 05:44.250]  with personal and fast support.

[05:49.650 --> 05:50.950]  Head to ShadyRays.com
[05:50.950 --> 05:52.590]  and use code DOESITDO
[05:52.590 --> 05:54.930]  That's D-O-E-S-I-T-D-O
[05:54.930 --> 05:56.930]  for 50% off two
[05:56.930 --> 05:59.370]  or more pairs of polarized sunglasses.
[05:59.370 --> 06:01.290]  Try it for yourself. Shades rated
[06:01.290 --> 06:02.930]  five stars by over
[06:05.150 --> 06:05.950]  250,000
[06:05.950 --> 06:06.730]  people.
[06:07.330 --> 06:09.770]  Maybe we should think differently. Maybe we should think outside the box a little bit.
[06:10.030 --> 06:11.570]  Construction workers mix concrete, right?
[06:11.870 --> 06:13.630]  What if we could mix up a little bit of concrete?
[06:13.930 --> 06:15.490]  What's the ratio? We need a bit of water in this?
[06:16.210 --> 06:17.310]  Well, for concrete? Yeah.
[06:17.550 --> 06:17.970]  I don't know.
[06:22.610 --> 06:23.890]  That can't be good to breathe.
[06:24.330 --> 06:25.450]  Just don't drink any
[06:25.450 --> 06:27.390]  water for a while. Pouring a slab.
[06:27.390 --> 06:28.430]  Okay, here we go.
[06:28.630 --> 06:30.050]  Mask, eyes, and gloves.
[06:32.530 --> 06:33.390]  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[06:33.950 --> 06:34.310]  Alright.
[06:35.350 --> 06:37.250]  Now, you probably don't need as much water.
[06:39.610 --> 06:40.390]  That should be enough.
[06:43.610 --> 06:44.650]  Oh, that is going.
[06:45.510 --> 06:47.410]  Look at that. What should we build with this?
[06:47.810 --> 06:49.230]  Oh, we should probably, like, patch a hole
[06:49.230 --> 06:50.670]  in the floor or something. Yeah.
[06:52.250 --> 06:53.510]  There's no hole. Can we get a hammer?
[06:54.370 --> 06:55.310]  I gotta be honest with you.
[06:56.390 --> 06:57.370]  That looks like regulation
[06:57.370 --> 06:59.430]  concrete to me. Imagine a construction
[06:59.430 --> 07:01.370]  site with, you know, a couple thousand of these
[07:01.370 --> 07:03.510]  going. And a bunch of guys
[07:03.510 --> 07:05.230]  standing back like this. Standing around.
[07:05.470 --> 07:06.530]  Watching it do all the work.
[07:07.170 --> 07:08.710]  What should we... Oh, you know, we can concrete.
[07:08.850 --> 07:10.310]  We can concrete our spaghetti. That's true.
[07:10.990 --> 07:12.290]  Seal it in the bag? Yeah.
[07:14.090 --> 07:14.730]  Alright, load me up.
[07:23.620 --> 07:24.820]  Check on that tomorrow.
[07:28.020 --> 07:28.660]  Now you can
[07:29.500 --> 07:30.920]  patch drywall with this.
[07:31.180 --> 07:32.940]  You can bondo your car.
[07:33.260 --> 07:33.700]  Insulation.
[07:34.580 --> 07:36.220]  Put it between some walls.
[07:37.260 --> 07:38.360]  Spaghettistallation, they call it.
[07:39.080 --> 07:40.820]  And that's gonna bind and that's gonna hold.
[07:40.920 --> 07:42.980]  We'll check back in on that in a couple days.
[07:43.180 --> 07:44.240]  You don't wanna try a salad spinner?
[07:44.400 --> 07:45.860]  Like a salad and concrete spinner? Yeah.
[07:46.120 --> 07:48.020]  Once you've poured the slab,
[07:48.780 --> 07:51.000]  use the same old...
[07:51.000 --> 07:51.220]  Oh.
[07:53.020 --> 07:54.040]  Then we need the dressing.
[07:54.800 --> 07:55.960]  Oh, you got dressing for it?
[07:56.300 --> 07:58.600]  Oh. I didn't realize we were getting a full salad out of that.
[08:00.720 --> 08:01.340]  Oh, there we go.
[08:04.320 --> 08:15.610]  And then...
[08:15.610 --> 08:16.550]  Let's think about
[08:16.550 --> 08:18.730]  some non-food related solutions.
[08:18.890 --> 08:20.390]  What about mixing paint? Okay.
[08:20.550 --> 08:22.510]  Currently we have just a pile of red and a pile
[08:22.510 --> 08:24.730]  of blue. Everybody knows those
[08:24.730 --> 08:26.530]  colors. Those are boring colors. We hate
[08:26.530 --> 08:28.790]  those colors. It's fires and sky.
[08:28.910 --> 08:30.370]  We don't care about fires and sky.
[08:30.790 --> 08:32.690]  What we want is the majesty of purple.
[08:33.190 --> 08:33.590]  Ready?
[08:36.550 --> 08:36.950]  Oh!
[08:38.310 --> 08:39.470]  Alright, now we need a canvas.
[08:39.990 --> 08:40.770]  Do we have a canvas?
[08:42.630 --> 08:44.250]  Hmm. You can just whip it at this.
[08:44.770 --> 08:46.410]  Okay. You ready?
[08:46.570 --> 08:46.730]  Yep.
[08:50.540 --> 08:50.920]  Oh!
[08:52.240 --> 08:54.220]  That honestly looks like red
[08:54.220 --> 08:56.480]  and blue paint at the same time, not mixed.
[08:56.740 --> 08:58.660]  Like if you wanna make paint swirls,
[08:58.700 --> 09:00.180]  I guess maybe that's a way
[09:00.180 --> 09:02.460]  you can take it. Oh! Alright, one last thing.
[09:02.460 --> 09:04.600]  What do we cap off a successful day
[09:04.600 --> 09:05.520]  with? Cheeky Bev?
[09:06.560 --> 09:07.420]  Close. Yep.
[09:08.800 --> 09:10.500]  Dessert. There we go. You wanna make
[09:10.500 --> 09:12.260]  an ice cream sundae, but you don't wanna do all the work
[09:12.260 --> 09:14.620]  that entails ice cream
[09:14.620 --> 09:16.420]  sundaes. So much to mix it all
[09:16.420 --> 09:18.000]  together. You could help. Yeah.
[09:18.920 --> 09:20.480]  Everything's so sticky with dressing
[09:20.480 --> 09:22.140]  and paint. It's pretty slippery. Concrete.
[09:22.680 --> 09:24.260]  Does this have one of those like undes...
[09:26.120 --> 09:27.640]  How much of that you want? That's good. Yep.
[09:28.860 --> 09:29.860]  Ice cream sundae on the go?
[09:32.460 --> 09:32.680]  Oh.
[09:36.320 --> 09:38.020]  Yeah, it can't handle ice cream
[09:38.020 --> 09:39.520]  apparently. Top me off.
[09:41.900 --> 09:42.100]  Okay.
[09:45.460 --> 09:45.820]  That's good.
[09:46.280 --> 09:46.820]  That's pretty good.
[09:48.960 --> 09:49.760]  Oh, God.
[09:54.870 --> 09:55.790]  That's a lot of cherry
[09:55.790 --> 09:56.370]  juice in there.
[09:57.550 --> 09:59.430]  We might have got the ratio wrong on that.
[09:59.690 --> 10:01.450]  How good is your mouth seal? If you had to...
[10:01.450 --> 10:03.730]  Oh, like, okay. If you had to not let
[10:03.730 --> 10:04.150]  any escape.
[10:08.870 --> 10:09.910]  It's still coming out?
[10:10.090 --> 10:11.770]  Are you just doing nitrous at this point?
[10:12.350 --> 10:13.530]  Are you just going to be off your ass?
[10:17.770 --> 10:19.830]  Thanks for watching this episode
[10:19.830 --> 10:20.870]  of Does It Do?
[10:25.850 --> 10:27.330]  It's still going. It's broken.
[10:27.690 --> 10:28.530]  Oh, shit.
[10:29.370 --> 10:30.710]  I'm going to shit myself.
[10:32.010 --> 10:33.530]  I'm going to shit my pants right now.
[10:33.610 --> 10:34.090]  Don't do it.
[10:34.090 --> 10:35.030]  Oh, God.
[10:36.130 --> 10:37.890]  I've got to be honest with you. Outside of mixing
[10:37.890 --> 10:39.230]  small amounts of concrete,
[10:40.130 --> 10:42.150]  I can't endorse this product.
[10:42.290 --> 10:44.030]  I don't know about you, Gavin, but in the grand scheme
[10:44.030 --> 10:45.710]  of things, I say it doesn't.
[10:46.050 --> 10:47.110]  So, what do we do?
[10:47.550 --> 10:49.190]  If it doesn't make the haul of do,
[10:49.390 --> 10:50.830]  it makes the pile of don't.
[10:51.490 --> 10:54.150]  So, I'm afraid...
[10:54.890 --> 10:55.530]  There we go.
[10:58.130 --> 10:59.610]  Now, they can't all be winners, right?
[10:59.790 --> 11:01.530]  Tune in next week for another episode of
[11:01.530 --> 11:02.450]  Does It Do?
[11:03.210 --> 11:04.410]  Why don't we do that one first?
[11:05.690 --> 11:07.630]  The show gets dirtier
[11:07.630 --> 11:08.190]  by the season.
