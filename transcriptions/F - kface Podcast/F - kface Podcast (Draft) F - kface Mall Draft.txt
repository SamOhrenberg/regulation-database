[00:10.160 --> 00:13.420]  Hello and welcome to another really dumb draft we're doing.
[00:13.560 --> 00:17.040]  This is the malls draft. Let me explain how this works.
[00:17.120 --> 00:21.780]  Imagine, guys, that we're all, we're all competing malls is sort of how I visualize this.
[00:21.840 --> 00:25.060]  We're all in the same town. We're all malls and we're drafting stores.
[00:25.180 --> 00:28.060]  So if we pick a store, nobody else's mall can have it.
[00:28.360 --> 00:30.440]  It's going to be four picks. Pick whatever you want.
[00:30.500 --> 00:33.320]  Just has to be mall stores or I guess things within a mall.
[00:33.860 --> 00:36.900]  And the goal is to build the best, the best mall.
[00:36.900 --> 00:38.500]  Yeah, you want to have the best mall.
[00:38.500 --> 00:41.240]  Essentially, what people will be determining for who the winner is,
[00:41.260 --> 00:43.360]  is what mall would they most like to go to?
[00:43.360 --> 00:48.140]  Like when I was a kid in Alabama, we had the Bel Air Mall and the Springdale Mall.
[00:48.680 --> 00:51.920]  And the Bel Air Mall was the good mall and the Springdale Mall was the shit mall.
[00:52.400 --> 00:54.960]  And so everybody wants, everybody here wants to be Bel Air Mall.
[00:55.220 --> 00:58.880]  Absolutely. Yeah. For me, it's like visualizing the malls I grew up with
[00:58.880 --> 01:01.400]  and what I liked about the specific ones.
[01:01.480 --> 01:04.420]  And if I could combine them, what a place that would be.
[01:04.740 --> 01:08.020]  I mean, you still live in a very mall centric place, right?
[01:08.020 --> 01:10.000]  Like where all your malls are in like a straight line.
[01:10.460 --> 01:11.860]  I do. Absolutely.
[01:12.100 --> 01:16.740]  But like it's I feel like unlike Geoff, the mall is not is not doing great.
[01:16.780 --> 01:20.140]  The malls here, they're a little they're a little lacking a lot of outdoor malls,
[01:20.160 --> 01:21.320]  which I personally don't prefer.
[01:21.800 --> 01:24.320]  I like being in a space and walking around from place to place.
[01:24.420 --> 01:25.900]  There's not a lot that caters to that.
[01:26.580 --> 01:28.420]  But I'm really excited because Geoff, big mall guy.
[01:28.480 --> 01:29.440]  I can't wait to see your board.
[01:29.500 --> 01:32.000]  I feel like this is the most specific to your interest.
[01:32.200 --> 01:35.880]  I mean, I feel like and let me say right off the bat, I agree with you.
[01:35.880 --> 01:38.980]  I don't think an outdoor mall should be allowed to be called a mall.
[01:39.540 --> 01:41.180]  Like it bugs me when they do it.
[01:41.260 --> 01:45.100]  It's just a fucking shopping complex or a shopping center or a strip strip mall.
[01:45.300 --> 01:45.860]  I'm OK with.
[01:46.240 --> 01:48.240]  Right. Gavin is also here.
[01:48.320 --> 01:49.700]  Gavin, how are you feeling about the mall draft?
[01:51.120 --> 01:52.700]  Uh, I feel all right.
[01:53.760 --> 01:54.700]  Five out of ten.
[01:55.420 --> 01:57.860]  That's not a good on the rock.
[01:58.060 --> 01:59.840]  Yeah. Wasn't it seven on the last one?
[01:59.880 --> 02:00.900]  Yeah. I hope I do it right.
[02:01.840 --> 02:03.360]  I think you're going to do great.
[02:03.680 --> 02:05.580]  I think this is going to be your draft.
[02:05.580 --> 02:09.680]  I feel like I have a bit of a leg up because I'm a little older than y'all.
[02:09.880 --> 02:14.660]  And I got to literally live through the height of the mall craze.
[02:15.220 --> 02:19.560]  And so I feel like I was more immersed and steeped in it than the younger of you were.
[02:19.660 --> 02:22.120]  I feel like I've been in an American mall maybe twice.
[02:22.680 --> 02:23.200]  Oh, great.
[02:23.460 --> 02:28.100]  I was about to ask any concern about how international this podcast is?
[02:28.760 --> 02:32.420]  I think it's going to be interesting because I definitely also have some
[02:32.420 --> 02:34.460]  some regional choices on my list.
[02:34.460 --> 02:34.940]  Oh, good.
[02:35.880 --> 02:36.940]  I'm excited to see.
[02:37.100 --> 02:38.020]  So we should randomize this?
[02:38.380 --> 02:43.920]  In order to select what we need to do here, we are going to use random.org.
[02:44.180 --> 02:47.420]  And we are going to I'm sharing my screen so that way everyone can see.
[02:47.620 --> 02:49.380]  And I'm doing it fair. And that is what we're doing.
[02:49.820 --> 02:51.000]  Do you have a spreadsheet for this one too?
[02:51.380 --> 02:53.940]  Yeah, yeah. I'll send that right after we do this because I have to put the order
[02:53.940 --> 02:55.520]  in after we randomize it.
[02:55.760 --> 02:58.400]  So we have Geoff, Gavin, Andrew, Eric, Nick.
[02:58.520 --> 02:59.780]  I am randomizing now.
[02:59.780 --> 03:05.480]  Before you randomize it, what determine the order that you typed into this box?
[03:06.480 --> 03:10.240]  That's typically that's typically how I list the names out
[03:10.240 --> 03:12.060]  when I'm doing metadata for the show.
[03:12.280 --> 03:16.100]  OK, and I also feel like this is how you guys are introduced.
[03:16.840 --> 03:20.660]  I yeah, I feel like the at the official order should be in an egg.
[03:21.680 --> 03:23.780]  Do you think it should be Andrew?
[03:23.920 --> 03:26.140]  You want me to relist this as an egg?
[03:26.140 --> 03:27.380]  But which G am I?
[03:27.680 --> 03:28.240]  Andrew, Nick, Eric.
[03:29.580 --> 03:32.180]  I don't care. Do you want to be first G or second G?
[03:32.560 --> 03:33.400]  I could be last G.
[03:33.780 --> 03:35.860]  You want to be last G? All right, I'll be first G, you're last B.
[03:36.580 --> 03:39.780]  OK, so that's and now let's just say that's the official.
[03:40.200 --> 03:42.300]  That is how officially how we order f*** face.
[03:42.420 --> 03:44.460]  I mean, that's not how we should order f*** face.
[03:44.560 --> 03:46.160]  That's like that doesn't make any sense.
[03:46.760 --> 03:47.120]  An egg.
[03:47.240 --> 03:50.040]  I'm annoyed. I'm annoyed because I really want the first pick.
[03:50.100 --> 03:53.740]  If you get the first pick, Eric, because I just got moved from the third slot to the first.
[03:54.380 --> 03:57.340]  We all have the same odds.
[03:57.540 --> 03:58.100]  How about this?
[03:58.220 --> 03:59.460]  But it's pulling from a position.
[03:59.500 --> 04:00.580]  How about this? How about this?
[04:00.780 --> 04:04.700]  To assuage Andrew, what if you randomize it five times?
[04:06.400 --> 04:07.620]  So just hit random five.
[04:07.620 --> 04:08.200]  OK, let's try.
[04:08.360 --> 04:10.360]  You know what? Five is my lucky number.
[04:10.880 --> 04:12.340]  I like five. I like five a lot.
[04:12.420 --> 04:13.260]  There's five of us.
[04:13.400 --> 04:15.100]  Wait, hang on. Gavin said once.
[04:15.520 --> 04:18.280]  Well, I think it should be once because we all remember the original order.
[04:18.440 --> 04:22.140]  And it would be funny to contrast it with where we would have been if you're right.
[04:22.140 --> 04:24.560]  If we randomize it five times, we're going to lose track of where everything went.
[04:25.280 --> 04:27.380]  I don't care about that. I want five. I like five.
[04:27.580 --> 04:28.340]  Five is my lucky number.
[04:28.560 --> 04:29.600]  All right, I'm pushing for five.
[04:29.980 --> 04:34.300]  OK, should we read out what it randomizes each time or at least?
[04:34.540 --> 04:35.500]  Yeah, so we're starting.
[04:35.520 --> 04:36.040]  All right, here we go.
[04:36.160 --> 04:37.600]  Andrew, Nick, Eric, Geoff, Gavin.
[04:37.740 --> 04:38.760]  Here's the first one.
[04:40.460 --> 04:43.460]  Geoff, Andrew, Eric, Gavin, Nick.
[04:43.880 --> 04:45.060]  Wow, Nick would have been picked again.
[04:45.720 --> 04:46.960]  That's the first randomization.
[04:47.100 --> 04:47.580]  Here's the second.
[04:49.260 --> 04:52.120]  Gavin, Nick, Andrew, Geoff, Eric.
[04:52.860 --> 04:55.100]  I'm moving back. I want to be in the front.
[04:55.380 --> 04:55.740]  Number three.
[04:57.060 --> 05:00.000]  Geoff, Andrew, Gavin, Eric, Nick.
[05:00.100 --> 05:01.220]  Nick at number five again.
[05:01.540 --> 05:02.520]  I don't want to go first.
[05:02.800 --> 05:03.800]  Number four.
[05:05.320 --> 05:07.780]  Geoff, Andrew, Gavin, Eric.
[05:08.120 --> 05:09.400]  Oh, my God.
[05:09.740 --> 05:10.140]  Come on.
[05:10.220 --> 05:11.280]  And now, number one.
[05:11.520 --> 05:11.920]  Fifth and final.
[05:13.080 --> 05:13.380]  Come on.
[05:14.460 --> 05:15.020]  Andrew!
[05:15.560 --> 05:16.920]  I told you.
[05:17.060 --> 05:18.240]  I told you.
[05:18.580 --> 05:20.540]  My lucky number.
[05:21.300 --> 05:21.860]  Five.
[05:23.080 --> 05:24.200]  First overall.
[05:24.940 --> 05:27.860]  I'm glad I took the last G because I would have been lost.
[05:28.460 --> 05:32.400]  Oh, my God.
[05:32.740 --> 05:34.240]  I can't believe I won that.
[05:34.640 --> 05:35.020]  Here is...
[05:37.820 --> 05:39.260]  Oh, that was so dumb.
[05:41.940 --> 05:42.980]  Okay, okay.
[05:43.140 --> 05:43.660]  We have a list.
[05:44.660 --> 05:45.140]  Andrew.
[05:46.380 --> 05:47.500]  Okay, fantastic.
[05:47.860 --> 05:48.540]  I'm so happy.
[05:49.580 --> 05:50.040]  Nick.
[05:52.280 --> 05:52.740]  Eric.
[05:53.840 --> 05:54.300]  Geoff.
[05:54.900 --> 05:55.920]  Bad RNG for Geoff.
[05:56.500 --> 05:57.020]  That's all right.
[05:58.400 --> 06:00.940]  Andrew, whenever you would like to begin.
[06:01.060 --> 06:02.700]  You are the first pick.
[06:02.860 --> 06:06.680]  So don't pick Crack Rock in the very first pick in the mall draft here.
[06:07.040 --> 06:10.760]  There's a lot of pressure, but I feel like this is an obvious, like, 1-1.
[06:10.880 --> 06:13.740]  I couldn't imagine this going beyond the second pick.
[06:14.260 --> 06:18.080]  It is to me, you are not a mall unless you have this store.
[06:18.080 --> 06:19.960]  At least in North America, it is the standard.
[06:20.200 --> 06:23.300]  It's not a store I would visit a lot, but it's always there.
[06:23.400 --> 06:24.360]  It's a comforting staple.
[06:24.720 --> 06:26.340]  I'm going with Spencer's Gifts, okay?
[06:26.500 --> 06:29.160]  To me, that is the all-time mall store.
[06:29.420 --> 06:29.840]  Spencer's Gifts.
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.660]  You're not going to see it anywhere.
[06:31.820 --> 06:32.280]  It's shitty.
[06:32.420 --> 06:34.400]  That's where you buy a lava lamp if you want one.
[06:34.520 --> 06:36.280]  Now they do weird sex toy stuff.
[06:36.580 --> 06:40.960]  It's very strange, but I just, I think it's a definitive mall staple.
[06:41.120 --> 06:43.360]  It's where pop culture IP goes to die.
[06:43.660 --> 06:44.500]  Yeah, it does.
[06:44.580 --> 06:46.240]  Yes, it is a graveyard.
[06:46.240 --> 06:48.580]  But it is a graveyard in most malls.
[06:48.640 --> 06:48.880]  It's true.
[06:48.960 --> 06:50.720]  We got Red vs. Blue stuff in there or no?
[06:50.880 --> 06:52.600]  Oh, I think we probably did at some point.
[06:56.680 --> 06:59.900]  Gavin, before you give your pick, any thoughts on Spencer's Gifts?
[07:00.400 --> 07:02.260]  I think that's where I got my pin clock from.
[07:03.160 --> 07:03.420]  Probably.
[07:03.960 --> 07:04.240]  Yeah.
[07:04.580 --> 07:07.980]  That's when I bought the eight-foot inflatable battle bus.
[07:08.060 --> 07:09.400]  That's where I got it from Spencer's Gifts.
[07:10.140 --> 07:10.620]  I forgot about that.
[07:10.620 --> 07:12.100]  Probably my most significant purchase from there.
[07:12.120 --> 07:13.040]  I'm feeling good about that.
[07:13.060 --> 07:15.220]  That wasn't on my list, so I didn't lose anything.
[07:15.260 --> 07:15.660]  Really?
[07:15.660 --> 07:17.180]  I mean, I considered it.
[07:17.280 --> 07:19.720]  I considered it, but I was definitely talking about not on my list.
[07:20.080 --> 07:20.200]  Yeah.
[07:20.680 --> 07:21.500]  Crazy to me.
[07:21.680 --> 07:22.920]  Okay, fair enough.
[07:23.160 --> 07:25.520]  Gavin, you have the second pick in the first round.
[07:26.980 --> 07:30.840]  I can't wait for like Twiddlywinks or some bullshit that I've never heard of.
[07:31.320 --> 07:32.700]  Twiddlywinks is good, but it's no.
[07:33.180 --> 07:40.520]  Greg's the ultimate place to get your sausage rolls and some Sammies.
[07:40.520 --> 07:46.960]  And also some of the best unintentional marketing I've ever seen in my life.
[07:47.360 --> 07:49.000]  That video.
[07:49.360 --> 07:50.520]  Is that what that's from?
[07:51.360 --> 07:52.680]  Yeah, everyone watch that.
[07:52.780 --> 07:53.280]  It's a classic.
[07:53.460 --> 07:55.940]  I'm sure we've all seen it, but it's probably one of the best videos on the internet.
[07:56.360 --> 08:00.300]  It is Plastic Bag Interrupts News Report Original on YouTube.
[08:00.640 --> 08:02.040]  I've never seen this before.
[08:02.400 --> 08:03.520]  I've never seen this either.
[08:04.880 --> 08:07.160]  I never looked at what brand the bag is.
[08:11.560 --> 08:12.600]  That's a fucking grab.
[08:12.720 --> 08:14.280]  I've never heard of Greg's, but that's a great pick.
[08:14.520 --> 08:18.280]  It's probably in my top 10 things of things I miss about England.
[08:18.900 --> 08:19.300]  Really?
[08:19.740 --> 08:20.140]  Wow.
[08:20.580 --> 08:20.980]  Wow.
[08:21.620 --> 08:23.020]  And is Greg's like everywhere?
[08:23.200 --> 08:24.700]  Is that like a common mall place?
[08:25.200 --> 08:25.360]  Yeah.
[08:25.640 --> 08:26.200]  Well, okay.
[08:26.400 --> 08:28.800]  It's a common... it's a chain.
[08:29.380 --> 08:29.500]  Yeah.
[08:29.580 --> 08:29.860]  Yeah.
[08:30.520 --> 08:31.160]  I just... yeah.
[08:31.580 --> 08:32.380]  Great. That's awesome.
[08:32.940 --> 08:34.280]  And I feel like it covers food.
[08:34.340 --> 08:36.060]  Like it has some food in it, it looks like.
[08:36.140 --> 08:39.620]  Like I think that's an important, at least for my consideration, for my board is.
[08:39.620 --> 08:42.400]  I think you got to have a place with at least food in it.
[08:42.420 --> 08:42.680]  Yeah.
[08:43.180 --> 08:44.200]  I completely agree.
[08:44.360 --> 08:47.080]  I felt like I have one food place because I feel like it's a requirement.
[08:47.440 --> 08:49.680]  If you're building at a mall, you have to give somebody something to eat.
[08:49.940 --> 08:52.080]  I don't know what Greg's is, but the picture you sent,
[08:52.160 --> 08:55.360]  it looks like it would be in a mall and everything is 50p.
[08:55.520 --> 08:56.220]  So that's nice.
[08:59.300 --> 09:01.940]  Nick, you are the third pick in the first round.
[09:02.080 --> 09:06.880]  So I feel like this is a store that you would always end up in to kill time at the mall.
[09:06.980 --> 09:08.360]  It was like the go-to store.
[09:08.360 --> 09:10.260]  And no one ever bought anything there.
[09:10.380 --> 09:14.700]  But hell, if you ever wanted or needed to get an experimental flying vacuum,
[09:14.960 --> 09:16.120]  this was the store for it.
[09:16.380 --> 09:17.700]  It's not loading.
[09:17.840 --> 09:19.140]  Brookstone is the store.
[09:19.720 --> 09:20.160]  Brookstone!
[09:21.620 --> 09:22.060]  Nice.
[09:22.320 --> 09:25.580]  But I mean, like it had all that high tech, weird travel stuff that you could get
[09:25.580 --> 09:27.600]  and like all the cool little gadgets and gizmos.
[09:27.660 --> 09:28.740]  And it's out of business now.
[09:28.840 --> 09:30.140]  But that place ruled.
[09:30.700 --> 09:33.960]  They had like, you could go test out the vibrating chairs there.
[09:34.200 --> 09:37.000]  Hang on, you picked a business in your first pick that's out of business?
[09:37.400 --> 09:39.800]  I mean, it's a mall staple.
[09:40.100 --> 09:41.480]  All mine are out of business.
[09:42.820 --> 09:43.180]  Really?
[09:43.960 --> 09:44.180]  What?
[09:44.480 --> 09:45.360]  Because it's still a mall.
[09:45.860 --> 09:48.080]  We're not building stores that exist today.
[09:48.200 --> 09:50.500]  We're building like the best of who we're going to build out the best mall.
[09:50.860 --> 09:52.300]  Right, malls of yesteryear.
[09:52.820 --> 09:53.020]  Yeah.
[09:54.240 --> 09:55.520]  Okay, that's fine.
[09:56.180 --> 09:57.260]  Sure, I guess.
[09:57.440 --> 09:58.340]  I think it's a fair question.
[09:58.640 --> 10:02.080]  It was a thought I had too, Eric, of do the stores actually still need to be in business?
[10:02.180 --> 10:05.060]  But I think it's a great point that this is like the fantasy mall.
[10:05.140 --> 10:06.800]  I mean, that truly does not make me feel better.
[10:06.800 --> 10:07.360]  Thank you.
[10:08.360 --> 10:12.100]  Knowing that you had the same question worries my line of thinking.
[10:13.000 --> 10:14.440]  It's a reasonable thought.
[10:15.440 --> 10:20.140]  I have the next pick, and I think that you guys are all thinking too small.
[10:20.680 --> 10:27.540]  I think that this is a staple in malls, and it is an AMC movie theater.
[10:28.700 --> 10:29.980]  Yeah, it's a great pick.
[10:30.320 --> 10:30.520]  Great.
[10:30.520 --> 10:38.900]  I think that it is such a thing that gets you to the mall so you do other things at the mall.
[10:39.960 --> 10:40.480]  Establishment.
[10:41.360 --> 10:45.720]  Like, that to me is the cornerstone of what I'm doing here.
[10:46.380 --> 10:52.660]  It's the reason why I would go to a mall now in my 30s versus truly any other reason.
[10:53.860 --> 10:55.160]  I think it's a great choice.
[10:55.680 --> 10:57.160]  I think a theater is a great pick.
[10:57.800 --> 11:00.020]  There's all sorts of brands you could pick from.
[11:01.280 --> 11:03.500]  AMC, is that just the one that you associate the most with?
[11:03.580 --> 11:03.920]  Yeah, definitely.
[11:03.920 --> 11:04.780]  Why would you go with AMC?
[11:04.920 --> 11:06.400]  Okay, that's a fair pick.
[11:06.600 --> 11:09.760]  I just think of seeing it from outside.
[11:09.940 --> 11:12.560]  Yeah, maybe a Regal, but really it's seeing it from outside of the mall.
[11:12.980 --> 11:20.380]  It is AMC, that stupid looking A, and that's a movie theater of the mall to me.
[11:20.380 --> 11:22.040]  Do you think that's top 10 worst A's?
[11:22.780 --> 11:23.800]  It's a bad A.
[11:24.300 --> 11:25.580]  That's a real shit A, you're right.
[11:25.620 --> 11:26.120]  Next draft.
[11:26.240 --> 11:27.020]  Yeah, it's not a good A.
[11:28.160 --> 11:28.720]  I agree.
[11:28.920 --> 11:29.880]  Bad A's, the draft.
[11:30.400 --> 11:32.520]  Does AMC have an arcade in it?
[11:32.600 --> 11:34.520]  I don't have an AMC where I live, so I was just curious.
[11:34.740 --> 11:35.560]  Yeah, they do.
[11:36.040 --> 11:39.140]  Okay, that's good, because I feel like that's also like you want that from a mall.
[11:39.160 --> 11:44.260]  You want to play Cruise in Worlds for a minute and then go sit for previews.
[11:44.580 --> 11:47.580]  You want like a gotcha game of like a claw machine or something,
[11:47.700 --> 11:49.360]  just somewhere in the lobby that you could fuck with.
[11:49.380 --> 11:52.700]  I also think it's a great theater that you could sneak from movie to movie
[11:52.700 --> 11:57.880]  if you're 14 years old and you're just trying to see a bunch of movies in a day.
[11:57.880 --> 12:00.260]  Just for like how it's designed or what?
[12:00.820 --> 12:02.620]  Yeah, it's just that kind of chain theater where it's like,
[12:02.760 --> 12:05.100]  well, we're going to employ just enough people to keep this thing running
[12:05.100 --> 12:08.420]  and they're all going to be 18 and none of them are going to give a fuck about this thing.
[12:09.020 --> 12:12.780]  So yeah, definitely go see four movies in one day if you're 14 years old.
[12:13.160 --> 12:14.180]  Do they have an ultimate combo?
[12:14.960 --> 12:18.880]  You know what? It's a great question. I don't know that they do.
[12:19.360 --> 12:23.780]  That's definitely a galaxy theater thing, but I'll have to do some research.
[12:25.440 --> 12:27.860]  But Geoff, you have the final pick in the first round.
[12:27.860 --> 12:31.460]  I'm the caboose in Agneg.
[12:33.600 --> 12:35.140]  I'm going to knock out a place.
[12:35.640 --> 12:39.340]  I'm thinking similarly where I'm not just trying to pick the coolest stores,
[12:39.480 --> 12:41.300]  but I'm trying to build... it's hard to do with four.
[12:41.420 --> 12:44.780]  Actually, I think it'd be much easier with five to build a full mall experience.
[12:44.920 --> 12:47.240]  But I think the cornerstone of any mall experience
[12:47.240 --> 12:49.320]  is you want to be able to go get a tasty snack,
[12:49.440 --> 12:53.440]  whether it's like a pretzel or a soda or something to walk around with
[12:53.440 --> 12:55.560]  while you're enjoying the mall to wet your whistle.
[12:55.560 --> 13:01.280]  And so I'm gone. I've picked a classic, classic, classic,
[13:01.900 --> 13:04.040]  maybe even a little bit before some of your time.
[13:04.540 --> 13:08.100]  But when you think of the mall in the 80s, you think of Orange Julius.
[13:08.160 --> 13:09.860]  Ah, that's a good one.
[13:10.220 --> 13:10.620]  Yeah.
[13:11.700 --> 13:13.360]  Gavin, you ever had an Orange Julius?
[13:13.760 --> 13:14.280]  No.
[13:15.800 --> 13:21.600]  It's like a frothy orange juice combo drink. It's awesome.
[13:21.980 --> 13:23.820]  It's partnered with Dairy Queen, right? Orange Julius?
[13:23.820 --> 13:25.940]  They are now. Orange Julius is still around, actually.
[13:26.100 --> 13:27.300]  I don't know if they're in any malls.
[13:27.480 --> 13:29.920]  You can also see at the height that you could get hot dogs there as well.
[13:30.060 --> 13:33.200]  Yeah, the tile pattern just screams 7-Eleven to me for some reason.
[13:33.320 --> 13:34.040]  The color scheme?
[13:34.200 --> 13:35.240]  Yeah, I think it's the color scheme.
[13:35.840 --> 13:40.140]  I think to me, I look at it and I see Florida, which is what you want in orange.
[13:40.540 --> 13:41.120]  You know what I mean?
[13:41.520 --> 13:41.700]  Yeah.
[13:42.620 --> 13:44.820]  So that's my first pick, Orange Julius.
[13:45.340 --> 13:49.020]  I also like the picture that you picked for it, which is definitely like...
[13:49.780 --> 13:54.860]  that looked like skateboarding to the mall, walking in, and there was the Orange Julius.
[13:55.220 --> 13:55.460]  Yes.
[13:55.480 --> 13:58.280]  We all had to scrounge together change to split one.
[13:58.900 --> 13:59.080]  Absolutely.
[13:59.580 --> 14:01.640]  Absolutely. Yeah, it just fits perfectly.
[14:01.900 --> 14:03.920]  I like that it looks kind of dingy in there.
[14:04.080 --> 14:05.580]  I think that's exactly right.
[14:05.820 --> 14:09.360]  The auto-exposure is really taken from the neon sign and everything else.
[14:10.880 --> 14:13.080]  No, but that's how it looks, Gavin.
[14:13.200 --> 14:17.900]  That is an accurate representation of how you feel when you're lining up for an Orange Julius.
[14:18.400 --> 14:20.180]  Oh, it's so good, too.
[14:20.440 --> 14:21.380]  They're the best.
[14:21.940 --> 14:23.300]  We are snake drafting.
[14:23.560 --> 14:25.860]  So, Geoff, because you're the caboose, now you are the engine.
[14:26.260 --> 14:28.580]  And you get to pick first in the second round.
[14:28.680 --> 14:29.260]  Oh, shit.
[14:29.620 --> 14:32.160]  This is gonna be difficult.
[14:33.820 --> 14:35.740]  I'm gonna have to narrow it down.
[14:36.040 --> 14:38.240]  All right, I'm going...
[14:38.240 --> 14:39.480]  Oh, fuck me.
[14:40.940 --> 14:41.840]  Yeah, okay.
[14:43.300 --> 14:44.140]  I'm gonna go...
[14:49.920 --> 14:50.320]  Fuck.
[14:51.660 --> 14:52.300]  Leave all this in.
[14:53.780 --> 14:56.860]  Well, I've got three different things that I still haven't...
[14:56.860 --> 14:57.760]  I was kind of...
[14:57.760 --> 15:00.920]  I was hoping you guys would help me make my choice based on what you did or didn't pick.
[15:01.500 --> 15:03.140]  All right, I'm gonna go with this one.
[15:03.880 --> 15:08.760]  When I would go to the mall and I would save up my money, there were two places I would spend it.
[15:09.560 --> 15:10.800]  This was one of them.
[15:11.440 --> 15:15.240]  There's probably different versions of this around, but this is the one that was the
[15:15.240 --> 15:19.880]  largest music chain in North America in the mall at the time.
[15:20.220 --> 15:24.000]  So I am going with Camelot Music.
[15:24.440 --> 15:24.700]  What?
[15:24.860 --> 15:26.120]  Oh, Camelot Music.
[15:26.400 --> 15:29.680]  Yeah, I think it became FYE eventually, but it was the largest.
[15:29.960 --> 15:34.860]  It was the largest music record store, tape store, CD store in America.
[15:35.040 --> 15:35.500]  And they were in every mall.
[15:35.500 --> 15:36.420]  Looks like it says Cramelot.
[15:38.820 --> 15:40.940]  I've never been to Cramelot Music, Geoff.
[15:41.480 --> 15:42.300]  Camelot Music.
[15:42.300 --> 15:47.120]  I think by like 94 or so, they were they would switched over to FYE.
[15:47.780 --> 15:50.240]  I, you know, this is so far with your picks, Geoff.
[15:50.300 --> 15:54.600]  This has completely shifted my view of your mall experience, which I think is interesting.
[15:54.780 --> 16:00.240]  In my head, you have walked around the mall in recent times being excited about what the
[16:00.240 --> 16:05.420]  mall currently brings, where now I'm viewing it as like you walking around imagining what once was.
[16:05.940 --> 16:07.480]  The Orange Julius that used to be there.
[16:07.540 --> 16:08.420]  The Camelot Music.
[16:08.720 --> 16:12.280]  I'm imagining the best version of a mall that I could put together.
[16:12.280 --> 16:14.520]  Across this expanse of time.
[16:15.020 --> 16:20.080]  And at the time when Camelot Music was at its height, that was where every teenager went,
[16:20.180 --> 16:23.380]  because that's where like you would go get the new Nine Inch Nails CD or whatever.
[16:23.660 --> 16:25.380]  As soon as it came out, it was a big fucking deal.
[16:25.560 --> 16:26.940]  They got union check back there.
[16:28.340 --> 16:29.020]  Under books.
[16:29.440 --> 16:33.680]  And they had books and stuff, too, which is kind of why I picked it.
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.660]  So because I did have like bookstores and stuff on my list as well.
[16:36.740 --> 16:38.140]  But yeah, I'm narrowing it down to Camelot.
[16:38.200 --> 16:38.860]  That's what I'm going with.
[16:39.260 --> 16:40.020]  I think it's a good pick.
[16:40.020 --> 16:43.220]  I never experienced Camelot Music, obviously,
[16:43.380 --> 16:46.520]  but I definitely have similar mall experiences with different stores
[16:46.520 --> 16:47.940]  that fill that exact same need.
[16:48.240 --> 16:49.460]  I think that is a staple for sure.
[16:49.960 --> 16:50.000]  Yeah.
[16:50.540 --> 16:50.840]  Okay.
[16:51.840 --> 16:53.940]  I have the next pick in the second round.
[16:54.520 --> 16:56.660]  And I wonder how you guys are going to feel about this,
[16:56.680 --> 16:58.040]  because we talked about food places.
[16:58.460 --> 17:04.000]  And this to me is a mall staple, but I don't know if you're going to agree.
[17:04.520 --> 17:05.960]  I think that, well, we'll see.
[17:06.780 --> 17:09.720]  My pick for my food spot in my mall,
[17:09.860 --> 17:11.960]  walk out of the AMC theater, I'm done watching a movie,
[17:12.480 --> 17:18.780]  and I go right to the McDonald's to buy the giant thing of french fries and walk around.
[17:19.280 --> 17:24.380]  That is absolutely my mall spot getting something to eat.
[17:24.800 --> 17:27.100]  So you're just sort of grazing on super-sized fries?
[17:27.420 --> 17:27.840]  Absolutely.
[17:28.420 --> 17:31.400]  At one point, I remember being...
[17:32.380 --> 17:33.900]  God, it had to be like 11 or 12.
[17:33.900 --> 17:37.860]  And you could get like a bucket of french fries.
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.360]  It was just like an absurd amount of french fries.
[17:40.560 --> 17:43.740]  And we would just get that and walk around the mall
[17:43.740 --> 17:45.940]  and eat this giant bucket of french fries
[17:45.940 --> 17:48.580]  and walk into stores and touch everything with our greasy little hands.
[17:50.440 --> 17:51.460]  That sounds great.
[17:51.580 --> 17:54.920]  That is such a good pick, Eric, because you're reminding me...
[17:54.920 --> 17:58.180]  My career started at the McDonald's in Bel Air Mall.
[17:58.500 --> 17:58.980]  Wow.
[17:59.100 --> 18:01.120]  There was like, you could sit at the...
[18:01.120 --> 18:03.700]  There was like a bar you could sit at.
[18:04.380 --> 18:06.420]  Faced into the mall, and it just had a glass window,
[18:06.620 --> 18:07.980]  and you could watch people walk by.
[18:08.340 --> 18:11.160]  And my friends and I would just sit and similarly eat french fries,
[18:11.240 --> 18:13.560]  like a basket of french fries, and just make fun of people.
[18:13.740 --> 18:16.800]  And I think that's when I realized I wanted to be funny.
[18:17.240 --> 18:18.360]  Or make fun of people for a living.
[18:20.380 --> 18:22.000]  This is really interesting for me to see,
[18:22.060 --> 18:25.420]  because I've never seen a McDonald's in a mall by itself before.
[18:25.660 --> 18:25.980]  Oh, hell yeah.
[18:25.980 --> 18:27.320]  This is not something I have.
[18:27.400 --> 18:28.720]  Yeah, to me, I associate...
[18:28.720 --> 18:30.320]  If you're going to get a McDonald's in a mall,
[18:30.380 --> 18:31.700]  it's going to be attached to a Walmart.
[18:31.700 --> 18:33.180]  Like, that's the only...
[18:33.180 --> 18:37.240]  I do not think of McDonald's as a standalone mall in place.
[18:37.480 --> 18:40.180]  That was my concern, making the pick.
[18:40.260 --> 18:41.980]  Because I had this conversation with my wife,
[18:42.040 --> 18:43.080]  and she said McDonald's.
[18:43.120 --> 18:44.140]  And I went, oh, I don't...
[18:44.140 --> 18:44.520]  Oh, yeah.
[18:44.660 --> 18:47.040]  It wasn't the first thing I thought of,
[18:47.080 --> 18:49.020]  but when she brought it up, it's like, that's the best...
[18:49.020 --> 18:52.500]  To me, the best pick that I don't know that everyone's going to agree with,
[18:52.740 --> 18:54.260]  because of exactly what Andrew just said.
[18:54.660 --> 18:55.460]  I think it's a good pick.
[18:55.620 --> 18:56.720]  I just, I've never seen it.
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.460]  I have seen it many times.
[18:58.640 --> 19:01.320]  So, I think it became less...
[19:01.320 --> 19:03.520]  I think McDonald's must have pulled out of malls at some point.
[19:03.640 --> 19:05.520]  Yeah, I also think that it's an international thing.
[19:05.780 --> 19:07.800]  It's probably very much U.S.
[19:07.800 --> 19:10.760]  and probably not in a lot of other places in this way.
[19:11.100 --> 19:11.400]  Yeah.
[19:12.120 --> 19:12.840]  There you go.
[19:12.980 --> 19:13.600]  Great pick, though.
[19:13.820 --> 19:14.480]  Thank you.
[19:14.880 --> 19:16.200]  Next pick, Nick.
[19:16.820 --> 19:17.540]  Your second pick.
[19:17.900 --> 19:19.260]  It feels like the round of food,
[19:19.380 --> 19:21.500]  or at least the kind of tail end off of that.
[19:21.620 --> 19:25.980]  So, I'm going to go with the place I feel like is the easiest snack food,
[19:26.040 --> 19:27.600]  because it is one you can carry around with you.
[19:27.640 --> 19:29.420]  But also, if you want a dessert, you can get a dessert.
[19:29.500 --> 19:30.620]  If you just want a hot dog,
[19:30.620 --> 19:32.360]  you know, if you want a pretzel,
[19:32.500 --> 19:34.520]  of course, they got that great dipping sauce.
[19:34.740 --> 19:35.500]  Annie Anne's.
[19:35.700 --> 19:37.100]  Oh, Annie Anne's.
[19:38.500 --> 19:39.360]  On my list.
[19:39.880 --> 19:40.860]  It was on my list.
[19:41.200 --> 19:42.720]  I did not pick it.
[19:42.780 --> 19:44.160]  It's like Pavlov's dog.
[19:44.260 --> 19:48.540]  I start to drool when I get to the food court and I smell that pretzel.
[19:51.560 --> 19:54.960]  I don't know that I've ever bought anything from Auntie Anne's,
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.300]  but I have eaten a million free samples.
[19:57.540 --> 19:58.180]  Oh, that too.
[19:58.660 --> 20:00.360]  Ah, yeah.
[20:00.420 --> 20:01.580]  If you don't have cash, you can get it.
[20:01.940 --> 20:04.420]  That's like the most recognizable smell, too.
[20:04.540 --> 20:08.180]  Like when you get within smell range of Annie Anne's, you know it instantly.
[20:09.060 --> 20:10.540]  Just fresh like pretzel.
[20:10.620 --> 20:11.320]  It smells so good.
[20:11.500 --> 20:12.320]  It's a great smell.
[20:12.720 --> 20:15.340]  My favorite Annie Anne's thing is not even like mall specific,
[20:15.600 --> 20:20.680]  but Calvin Johnson was like the number one wide receiver in the NFL for a long time.
[20:20.700 --> 20:21.780]  And he retired early.
[20:21.880 --> 20:25.200]  But there are all these rumors for like the next three years post-retirement
[20:25.200 --> 20:27.040]  that he might come back to the NFL
[20:27.040 --> 20:29.080]  and then he might play for the Patriots.
[20:29.520 --> 20:32.160]  And it was reported that he was flying into Boston
[20:32.160 --> 20:33.780]  and it was kind of around the trade deadline.
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.320]  So people were losing their minds that this was like a sign that he was going to return
[20:38.320 --> 20:40.220]  and that the Patriots can trade for him.
[20:40.260 --> 20:41.320]  It was going to be this big move.
[20:41.360 --> 20:46.200]  But in reality, he just owned a chain of Auntie Anne's pretzel places.
[20:46.200 --> 20:48.280]  And they were having like a get.
[20:48.380 --> 20:51.140]  It was like a marketing meetup type thing for Auntie Anne's.
[20:51.280 --> 20:52.560]  Had nothing to do with football.
[20:53.200 --> 20:54.300]  Entirely pretzel related.
[20:54.740 --> 20:56.760]  So that's like the main memory I have because we don't have these.
[20:56.760 --> 20:58.400]  I've never eaten Auntie Anne's.
[20:58.520 --> 21:01.600]  But I always think of Calvin Johnson when I see Auntie Anne's.
[21:01.660 --> 21:04.100]  This is a weird association, but I just think it's so funny.
[21:04.580 --> 21:08.620]  The idea of NFL fans losing their minds over what was just like a pretzel related purchase.
[21:10.120 --> 21:14.040]  Uh, good pick. I really like it.
[21:14.160 --> 21:18.200]  Gavin, before you do your second pick, how are you feeling about these moles so far?
[21:18.240 --> 21:19.280]  How are you feeling about this draft?
[21:19.600 --> 21:21.440]  I feel like this is going pretty smooth so far.
[21:21.720 --> 21:22.920]  Okay. Okay.
[21:23.320 --> 21:25.060]  It's uh, I'm really glad to hear that.
[21:25.060 --> 21:28.560]  Now, it's your turn. Your second pick.
[21:29.060 --> 21:33.080]  I'm imagining my dream mole, this uh, hypothetical mole being in America.
[21:33.600 --> 21:39.140]  And uh, you know, it's nice to buy cheap clothes when you don't care about them.
[21:39.540 --> 21:41.900]  And uh, it's nice to be as confusing as possible.
[21:43.100 --> 21:44.100]  TK Maxx!
[21:44.300 --> 21:44.820]  What?
[21:45.120 --> 21:45.580]  Oh!
[21:46.280 --> 21:46.840]  T...
[21:46.840 --> 21:47.980]  What is TK Maxx?
[21:48.280 --> 21:50.000]  I feel like I've heard of TK Maxx.
[21:50.140 --> 21:51.420]  Is it TK in the UK?
[21:51.420 --> 21:55.320]  Yep, for some reason, TK Maxx is uh, TK Maxx in the UK.
[21:55.520 --> 21:55.620]  What?
[21:56.060 --> 21:59.100]  That will uh, really confuse people when they walk past it.
[21:59.660 --> 22:00.040]  Huh.
[22:00.840 --> 22:01.280]  What?
[22:01.440 --> 22:02.480]  I can't... what?
[22:03.980 --> 22:04.420]  Wow.
[22:04.540 --> 22:05.480]  Is it the same store?
[22:06.040 --> 22:06.280]  Yep.
[22:06.700 --> 22:11.440]  It's like the... Andrew, it's not just the same store, it's like the same logo.
[22:11.860 --> 22:12.220]  Yeah.
[22:12.900 --> 22:14.060]  Oh, that's weird.
[22:14.920 --> 22:18.080]  What's the... what does the K stand for and the J stand for?
[22:18.160 --> 22:19.360]  For each one, does anyone...
[22:19.360 --> 22:20.020]  I have no idea.
[22:20.240 --> 22:20.980]  No clue.
[22:21.780 --> 22:22.220]  Huh.
[22:23.220 --> 22:27.840]  It doesn't stand for anything, although the name was created using initials of its founder,
[22:28.160 --> 22:29.340]  the T, the J, and the X.
[22:29.700 --> 22:32.020]  TJ Maxx is a riff off the TJX company.
[22:32.220 --> 22:33.800]  That's... there's nothing that it stands for.
[22:34.180 --> 22:34.580]  Weird.
[22:35.280 --> 22:38.720]  So they just changed the... yeah, because when I moved here, I was like, oh, there's...
[22:38.720 --> 22:39.920]  they've got T... wait, hang on.
[22:39.980 --> 22:42.420]  They got T... TJ Maxx?
[22:42.680 --> 22:44.140]  Why is it... what?
[22:44.580 --> 22:48.740]  Oh, it was modified in the UK to avoid confusion with the British retail chain.
[22:48.820 --> 22:49.840]  TJ Hughes.
[22:50.320 --> 22:52.020]  I've never even heard of TJ Hughes.
[22:52.080 --> 22:52.400]  What's that?
[22:55.580 --> 22:56.540]  TJ Hughes.
[22:56.560 --> 22:57.360]  It sounds like a bookshop.
[22:58.140 --> 22:58.980]  Discount store?
[23:00.920 --> 23:02.040]  I don't know.
[23:02.360 --> 23:02.960]  Never seen one.
[23:04.260 --> 23:05.500]  It's just like an everything store.
[23:06.360 --> 23:06.560]  Huh.
[23:07.100 --> 23:14.380]  Well, you know, I think TJ Maxx isn't what I would have thought of for a mall clothing spot,
[23:14.580 --> 23:15.780]  but I like it.
[23:15.980 --> 23:16.820]  I like that pick.
[23:16.820 --> 23:21.820]  That gets my grandma and my mom there easy.
[23:22.460 --> 23:26.860]  They can't wait to spend eight and a half hours inside of one of those places.
[23:27.240 --> 23:31.080]  That's such a great point because I don't think I'd ever pick it and I wouldn't think of it.
[23:31.140 --> 23:33.560]  But if I'm in a mall, there's a comfort in having it there.
[23:33.820 --> 23:35.600]  Even if I don't go there, it just feels right.
[23:35.900 --> 23:36.680]  That should be there.
[23:37.160 --> 23:37.560]  Absolutely.
[23:38.020 --> 23:38.720]  It's a good pick, Gavin.
[23:39.080 --> 23:39.520]  I thank you.
[23:39.820 --> 23:41.980]  I'm excited about my next two picks.
[23:42.700 --> 23:46.500]  Andrew, you get two in a row because you are the caboose and then the engine for this.
[23:46.500 --> 23:49.460]  And much like Geoff, you in the last, you know, the rock,
[23:49.780 --> 23:51.940]  rock, not rock draft, you talked about personal things.
[23:52.100 --> 23:56.720]  I really thought about like what my definitive mall experiences was.
[23:56.800 --> 23:58.500]  What were the moments I loved about the mall?
[23:58.900 --> 24:00.600]  What really connected with me?
[24:00.920 --> 24:07.460]  And I think by far my number one place that I would visit is GameStop, without a doubt.
[24:07.820 --> 24:13.900]  Going into the store, looking at all the used games, their DVDs, having the things of like
[24:13.900 --> 24:18.860]  the joy of a kid of having like maybe $15 and being like, what the fuck can I buy?
[24:18.980 --> 24:19.840]  Like what weird shit?
[24:19.900 --> 24:20.840]  I want a new game.
[24:21.340 --> 24:23.520]  What am I going to find that's pre-owned that I could fit?
[24:23.860 --> 24:27.280]  I spent so much time and GameStop's just like looking at random things.
[24:27.520 --> 24:32.420]  Also, just the kiosks of like when you don't own the console, like maybe you can't afford it.
[24:32.580 --> 24:34.560]  And so being able to play like the demo station.
[24:34.740 --> 24:39.420]  I played the King Kong 360 demo so many goddamn times.
[24:39.540 --> 24:41.120]  Just because it was the main thing available.
[24:41.180 --> 24:42.200]  I have a lot of fondness.
[24:42.200 --> 24:44.740]  Not for the brand itself.
[24:45.140 --> 24:46.860]  GameStop as an entity is terrible.
[24:47.120 --> 24:52.000]  But just the mall experience and sort of like the joyful ignorance of a kid just like going
[24:52.000 --> 24:52.860]  through a game store.
[24:53.520 --> 24:59.000]  Do you know those little kiosks you're talking about where you could sit and play 360 games?
[24:59.640 --> 25:06.400]  Do you know for like 18 months, we made like little interstitials for every video game that
[25:06.400 --> 25:08.280]  you could play there, like Topspin Golf.
[25:08.400 --> 25:10.120]  And there'd be like a 30 second intro.
[25:10.180 --> 25:11.320]  Yeah, a little AmiBee intro.
[25:11.320 --> 25:16.100]  Me and Bernie and Gus like making fucking, I don't know, jokes about golf or whatever.
[25:16.700 --> 25:18.720]  I think there's one for like Amped or something as well.
[25:19.060 --> 25:19.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[25:19.860 --> 25:20.320]  That's great.
[25:20.420 --> 25:20.720]  We did it.
[25:20.840 --> 25:20.980]  Yeah.
[25:21.500 --> 25:21.920]  I didn't even.
[25:22.060 --> 25:23.200]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[25:23.300 --> 25:28.560]  The weird nostalgia for having that like shitty like CRT on the ceiling that would just play
[25:28.560 --> 25:31.220]  like trailers of stuff like it's all great.
[25:31.700 --> 25:34.700]  All of that fundamental part of my mall experience growing up.
[25:34.920 --> 25:35.460]  Loved it.
[25:35.920 --> 25:36.820]  I think that's a great choice.
[25:36.900 --> 25:40.500]  It was also a great place to go buy a Red vs Blue DVD for about three years before they
[25:40.500 --> 25:41.340]  stopped selling DVDs.
[25:43.780 --> 25:45.320]  Sold about 50,000.
[25:45.400 --> 25:47.440]  Well, sold about 100,000 DVDs through GameStop probably.
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.280]  Wow, that's awesome.
[25:49.720 --> 25:50.900]  I guess I'll move on to my next one.
[25:51.240 --> 25:52.680]  This is I completely agree with Eric.
[25:52.760 --> 25:56.980]  The other main staple of a mall experience for me is the movie theater.
[25:57.100 --> 26:01.680]  Going to movies, having popcorn, the arcade, all of it is important.
[26:01.820 --> 26:06.280]  I'm going with the chain is Landmark Cinemas, but it's called the Avalon where I live.
[26:06.340 --> 26:08.120]  It's the perfect like neon thing.
[26:08.120 --> 26:10.180]  You want it sort of shitty for a mall.
[26:10.380 --> 26:16.940]  I will say one leg up Avalon slash Landmark has over AMC free popcorn refills without
[26:16.940 --> 26:17.320]  a membership.
[26:17.400 --> 26:17.740]  What?
[26:18.040 --> 26:21.780]  You still get the free refills on the large drink and the large popcorn, which is not
[26:21.780 --> 26:22.200]  offered.
[26:22.420 --> 26:24.100]  That was the main deciding factor for me.
[26:24.160 --> 26:28.600]  There's two theater chains where I live and one of them no longer does that.
[26:28.640 --> 26:32.040]  So I had to lean more towards the Avalon Landmark.
[26:32.480 --> 26:33.260]  Great theater.
[26:33.540 --> 26:37.180]  It's just as you said, I think it's such an important part of the mall experience is just
[26:37.180 --> 26:38.720]  killing time going from show to show.
[26:38.980 --> 26:43.080]  Like it's it's a spot I feel is needed to hang out for a long time in the mall, which
[26:43.080 --> 26:43.840]  is what you'd want to do.
[26:44.340 --> 26:44.520]  Yep.
[26:45.180 --> 26:45.800]  I like it.
[26:46.020 --> 26:47.020]  That's a that's a good pick.
[26:47.080 --> 26:48.220]  I think theater is a strong one.
[26:48.280 --> 26:49.000]  It's a strong choice.
[26:50.020 --> 26:54.700]  I'm curious to see what Gavin is about to do in his third round pick after TK Maxx.
[26:55.580 --> 27:00.180]  Well, for me, the staple of a mall and if we're talking about staples and cinemas and
[27:00.180 --> 27:01.580]  staples, we should probably have staples.
[27:02.560 --> 27:05.040]  OK, I don't think the mall should have staples.
[27:05.520 --> 27:07.140]  Do you want some stationery?
[27:07.580 --> 27:08.620]  If you want a stapler.
[27:09.160 --> 27:13.100]  I don't think I've ever seen a staples in a mall, but I think that's always quite big,
[27:13.180 --> 27:13.380]  aren't they?
[27:13.420 --> 27:15.340]  But maybe they need to shrink a staples down.
[27:16.400 --> 27:17.360]  Maybe just sell staples.
[27:17.680 --> 27:21.500]  Your ideal mall would have a staples that they've shrunken down and put in the mall.
[27:22.260 --> 27:23.180]  Yeah, I think so.
[27:23.740 --> 27:26.200]  Gavin's ultimate like, do you want to go to the mall Saturday?
[27:26.320 --> 27:31.740]  Like, oh, yeah, we could get we could go to staples and we could grab a meat pie at Greg's
[27:31.740 --> 27:33.300]  and then head over to TK Maxx.
[27:34.500 --> 27:35.700]  I'm so excited.
[27:36.120 --> 27:39.620]  Your mall is all the stores I don't go to.
[27:39.840 --> 27:44.640]  And I'm so excited to see what your fourth pick is going to be when it comes back around.
[27:45.160 --> 27:48.940]  Like, Gavin, you have give it like these are strong malls so far.
[27:49.320 --> 27:50.460]  Your mall is insane.
[27:50.600 --> 27:52.060]  And I can't wait to see what your fourth.
[27:52.420 --> 27:54.800]  I would love to see which people would be able.
[27:55.160 --> 27:59.140]  Yeah, I was about to say you're making a great case for most boring right now at this mall
[27:59.140 --> 27:59.460]  draft.
[28:01.580 --> 28:02.700]  I like Greg's.
[28:02.920 --> 28:03.820]  That seems fun.
[28:04.820 --> 28:06.640]  I think I think it's a great choice, Gav.
[28:06.720 --> 28:08.120]  Everybody needs office supplies.
[28:08.360 --> 28:09.840]  I've never seen it in a mall.
[28:09.980 --> 28:10.900]  That's interesting to me.
[28:10.920 --> 28:11.460]  Sort of like right.
[28:11.480 --> 28:13.680]  But it should be shrunken down and put in a mall.
[28:14.040 --> 28:14.220]  Yeah.
[28:14.280 --> 28:15.360]  OK, I guess.
[28:15.880 --> 28:18.100]  Has anyone here seen it in a mall, though?
[28:19.080 --> 28:20.400]  I don't know that I've been looking.
[28:21.920 --> 28:23.720]  That's a great argument against it.
[28:24.240 --> 28:25.280]  I mean, hang on.
[28:25.320 --> 28:25.740]  Let's see.
[28:26.820 --> 28:27.620]  Oh, Andrew.
[28:28.380 --> 28:31.460]  It looks like there's staples in the mall.
[28:31.460 --> 28:32.120]  Oh, yeah.
[28:32.300 --> 28:34.840]  Like I said, I've never seen it.
[28:34.960 --> 28:36.640]  It's got a window on the side.
[28:37.020 --> 28:38.300]  They just call it a staple.
[28:41.020 --> 28:43.260]  Looks like it might be next to a TK Maxx.
[28:43.260 --> 28:46.020]  It does look like it's next to a TK Maxx.
[28:47.240 --> 28:47.860]  That's great.
[28:47.900 --> 28:48.360]  That's your mall.
[28:48.400 --> 28:52.060]  I like that in that picture on the side to entice you to come in.
[28:52.140 --> 28:53.620]  It says paper and ink.
[28:55.040 --> 28:55.720]  Oh, boy.
[28:55.820 --> 28:56.880]  Oh, I better calm down.
[28:56.880 --> 28:58.760]  I get too excited about staples.
[28:59.440 --> 29:01.160]  Wait, we're just going to walk past here?
[29:01.440 --> 29:02.740]  Did you not see that?
[29:05.920 --> 29:08.420]  Nick, your third pick in the mall draft.
[29:08.600 --> 29:14.320]  So this is a place I feel like you go to to kind of, you know, chill out for a little bit.
[29:14.460 --> 29:17.500]  If it's if it is an outdoor mall, it's a good place just to pop in and be cool.
[29:17.600 --> 29:20.520]  But also, I just really love candles.
[29:21.560 --> 29:22.280]  Yankee Candle.
[29:22.440 --> 29:23.240]  Yankee Candle.
[29:23.820 --> 29:24.980]  Great spot to stop.
[29:25.060 --> 29:26.500]  They have a lot of different scents.
[29:26.500 --> 29:27.880]  You got to, you know, check them all out.
[29:28.320 --> 29:31.000]  Nick's mall smells so good.
[29:31.620 --> 29:37.560]  Well, and and also good indication of whether there's a COVID spike.
[29:37.840 --> 29:42.680]  That's so you're providing not just I'm providing an excellent shop,
[29:42.720 --> 29:44.700]  but also like a healthy human service.
[29:44.840 --> 29:46.580]  That's what I'm here for, man.
[29:47.100 --> 29:52.220]  I have instant memories of being drug into Yankee Candle and the Hallmark store with my
[29:52.220 --> 29:55.660]  mom when I was like nine and being just bored to fucking death.
[29:56.500 --> 29:58.820]  But then I guess that's a classic mall.
[29:59.240 --> 30:00.400]  Yankee Candle.
[30:02.680 --> 30:04.620]  You guys, you don't have Yankee Candle?
[30:06.420 --> 30:08.780]  Yankee Candle is probably still going strong, too.
[30:08.860 --> 30:09.840]  What do you guys have?
[30:09.960 --> 30:12.240]  Like, you guys have like candle.
[30:12.520 --> 30:14.680]  I don't even know what's a British soldier called.
[30:17.080 --> 30:18.680]  Now we got like Biffy's Wicks.
[30:19.340 --> 30:20.160]  I'm sorry.
[30:20.400 --> 30:22.400]  What the fuck did you just say?
[30:24.140 --> 30:24.840]  I'll be honest.
[30:24.900 --> 30:25.420]  I made that up.
[30:26.800 --> 30:29.200]  It sounded like it was out of Harry Potter, like a Harry Potter.
[30:30.360 --> 30:31.000]  Biffy's Wicks.
[30:31.260 --> 30:33.220]  Biffy's Wicks feels straight out of Harry Potter.
[30:35.200 --> 30:36.000]  Oh, man.
[30:37.340 --> 30:43.740]  My next pick, and this sort of changed for me when Nick, this was one that I thought
[30:43.740 --> 30:45.160]  of on the fly when Nick said Brookstone.
[30:45.460 --> 30:48.860]  And then we decided I just figured it had to be places that were open.
[30:49.380 --> 30:51.040]  And I was told that I was wrong.
[30:51.440 --> 30:51.860]  And that's fine.
[30:51.920 --> 30:52.500]  A quick replacement.
[30:52.500 --> 30:56.900]  But then I also, I also did some research and found out it is still open.
[30:58.760 --> 31:05.080]  My third pick in our mall draft, Suncoast Motion Picture Company.
[31:05.520 --> 31:08.500]  Dude, I have that same photo in my list.
[31:08.940 --> 31:09.500]  Do you really?
[31:09.980 --> 31:11.480]  Yeah, yeah, it's classic.
[31:12.240 --> 31:15.220]  Suncoast, there are three still open.
[31:15.560 --> 31:17.040]  That one's in Texas, I think, right?
[31:17.220 --> 31:20.540]  Beaumont, Texas, Omaha, Nebraska, Jacksonville, North Carolina.
[31:21.840 --> 31:22.280]  So...
[31:22.280 --> 31:24.020]  Cannot believe they're still going.
[31:24.120 --> 31:24.640]  What is it, movies?
[31:25.180 --> 31:25.880]  Oh, yeah.
[31:26.180 --> 31:33.340]  If you want to spend $44 on an anime VHS, Gavin, do I have the place for you?
[31:35.520 --> 31:40.520]  Suncoast is where we would go into and look at all of the stuff that you've never seen before.
[31:40.720 --> 31:44.080]  And you would be like, I've never heard of any of these movies, these anime,
[31:44.520 --> 31:46.660]  these cartoons, like any of this stuff.
[31:46.720 --> 31:49.040]  It is the craziest selection of stuff.
[31:50.000 --> 31:55.080]  Movies and just pop culture stuff before GameStop, like, really took that over.
[31:55.460 --> 31:57.520]  That's how that felt in, like, 1998.
[31:58.020 --> 32:00.760]  There was a time before, like, Best Buy and shit,
[32:00.920 --> 32:06.020]  when Suncoast was the only place you could go to get new DVDs and movies.
[32:06.340 --> 32:07.780]  I mean, you could buy used ones at Blockbuster,
[32:07.900 --> 32:10.640]  but if you wanted to go buy, like, a brand new Gremlins or whatever when it hit,
[32:10.700 --> 32:11.620]  you had to go to Suncoast.
[32:11.820 --> 32:17.900]  Yeah, and it was always really expensive, and it always had that marquee neon.
[32:17.900 --> 32:21.220]  All of them had, like, that marquee neon at, like, the top.
[32:21.540 --> 32:25.980]  And it was just such a cool look in such a cool spot when I was, like, 13
[32:25.980 --> 32:30.080]  that it's hard to not put it on my list.
[32:30.520 --> 32:31.580]  Pretty good A as well.
[32:32.140 --> 32:32.480]  Good A.
[32:32.740 --> 32:34.180]  Great, great looking A.
[32:34.360 --> 32:37.280]  I think all the letters there have such, like, a cool...
[32:37.280 --> 32:40.880]  There should be, like, a palm tree with it, you know what I mean?
[32:41.020 --> 32:43.020]  Like, there's... it's just, like, such a look.
[32:43.180 --> 32:44.700]  It has such a look to it.
[32:44.700 --> 32:45.280]  Yeah.
[32:46.140 --> 32:50.020]  Suncoast sounds like the name of a candle I would buy at Yankee Candle and enjoy.
[32:50.460 --> 32:50.780]  That's true.
[32:51.020 --> 32:52.560]  It has a great feel to it.
[32:52.660 --> 32:53.520]  Absolutely true.
[32:53.800 --> 32:54.200]  Great smell.
[32:54.520 --> 32:56.520]  But yeah, feel good about Suncoast as a third pick.
[32:56.880 --> 32:57.560]  I like it a lot.
[32:58.260 --> 32:59.760]  Okay, is that... is it on to me now?
[32:59.900 --> 33:00.600]  It's you, Geoff.
[33:00.720 --> 33:02.420]  I'll be honest, Eric.
[33:02.600 --> 33:07.360]  You did me a favor by picking Suncoast because it was in a trifecta of three
[33:07.360 --> 33:10.100]  that I just was having trouble figuring out.
[33:10.200 --> 33:14.260]  And so you eliminating it from contention makes this a little bit easier.
[33:14.260 --> 33:18.920]  Uh, I... I spent more time at Suncoast than most stores in the mall, I have to admit.
[33:19.140 --> 33:21.540]  Um, however, uh, when I'm built...
[33:21.540 --> 33:25.680]  the way I'm looking at it is Camelot Music probably has DVDs and they have books
[33:25.680 --> 33:27.600]  because I was also thinking about a bookstore.
[33:28.180 --> 33:31.060]  Um, and so I figured, like, Camelot kind of covered the much.
[33:31.280 --> 33:34.100]  So I'm going to move on to when you're a teenager and you're... or a kid
[33:34.100 --> 33:36.760]  and you're looking for stuff to do in the mall and you don't have a lot of money,
[33:37.440 --> 33:40.840]  there's... very few places are better to spend a half an hour to 45 minutes
[33:41.540 --> 33:42.600]  than Aladdin's Castle.
[33:42.600 --> 33:45.280]  Oh, is it like an arcade?
[33:45.620 --> 33:48.380]  Full arcade, you go in, you got like two or three bucks.
[33:48.720 --> 33:51.160]  You have to add a minimum, you can just go watch somebody play Pit Fighter
[33:51.160 --> 33:53.600]  or Mortal Kombat for an hour and it's entertaining.
[33:53.980 --> 33:57.640]  And, uh, there are probably even some teenagers that are smoking in there.
[33:57.760 --> 34:05.160]  Okay, so I grew up in malls in, like, the later... like, mid to late 90s, uh,
[34:05.500 --> 34:06.520]  in early 2000s.
[34:06.600 --> 34:11.920]  We didn't really have, like, independent arcades within the mall.
[34:11.920 --> 34:13.860]  Sometimes they were attached to a movie theater.
[34:14.320 --> 34:15.780]  Usually, no arcade at all.
[34:16.180 --> 34:16.380]  Really?
[34:16.780 --> 34:17.980]  Yeah, so like...
[34:17.980 --> 34:19.200]  It was a nationwide chain.
[34:19.540 --> 34:23.900]  Jack worked at Aladdin's Castle and if you bring it up, he'll tell you all about it for a while.
[34:23.960 --> 34:26.040]  Yeah, I won't... I'm not gonna bring it up for a while.
[34:26.800 --> 34:29.200]  But yeah, they were... they were nationwide when I was a kid.
[34:29.320 --> 34:33.500]  And they definitely kind of lost their prominence as, you know, as the 80s wore on for sure.
[34:33.620 --> 34:35.180]  But yeah, Aladdin's Castle was a staple.
[34:35.480 --> 34:38.600]  Yeah, I never saw an arcade in a... in a mall ever growing up.
[34:38.620 --> 34:38.900]  No.
[34:39.180 --> 34:40.300]  Yeah, right? Me neither.
[34:40.300 --> 34:43.440]  And it feels like it's such a thing in movies.
[34:43.680 --> 34:45.880]  Like, going to the mall and going to the arcade.
[34:46.020 --> 34:46.660]  Never had it.
[34:47.280 --> 34:50.060]  Yeah, it definitely was for me for sure.
[34:50.380 --> 34:50.960]  That's awesome.
[34:51.240 --> 34:51.760]  Yeah, I didn't have that.
[34:51.760 --> 34:52.260]  That's a great pick.
[34:52.420 --> 34:53.720]  That's such a cool marquee.
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.900]  That, like, the black and white checker, like, sort of trim is so cool.
[35:00.040 --> 35:01.940]  Like, that is so mall.
[35:02.300 --> 35:03.940]  It just is so mall.
[35:04.440 --> 35:05.980]  It's where you... it's like...
[35:05.980 --> 35:07.540]  You ever hear that bad religion song, Billy?
[35:07.740 --> 35:09.040]  That's where I assume it takes place.
[35:11.120 --> 35:15.420]  Go listen to that song and then imagine it's happening in Aladdin's Castle.
[35:15.580 --> 35:16.340]  And that's... yeah.
[35:16.460 --> 35:16.960]  It's pretty good.
[35:17.160 --> 35:17.700]  I love that pick.
[35:18.120 --> 35:22.280]  I had a hard time, as you said, like, for me, I couldn't figure out how to name it
[35:22.280 --> 35:24.400]  because none of the malls had, like, a distinct arcade.
[35:24.620 --> 35:28.260]  But there were, like, the area that had two Virtua Fighter cabinets
[35:28.260 --> 35:29.500]  and, like, a pinball machine.
[35:29.600 --> 35:29.800]  Yeah.
[35:29.800 --> 35:30.960]  It was just, like, by itself.
[35:31.080 --> 35:32.080]  There's, like, no...
[35:32.080 --> 35:34.620]  So knowing that there's a place called Aladdin's Castle where that's what that was,
[35:34.640 --> 35:35.020]  that's awesome.
[35:35.200 --> 35:35.720]  I didn't know that.
[35:36.400 --> 35:36.940]  Great pick.
[35:37.580 --> 35:37.940]  Thanks.
[35:37.940 --> 35:40.380]  I mean, Geoff, you've picked three.
[35:40.940 --> 35:42.820]  And now it's your fourth and final.
[35:42.940 --> 35:45.160]  This begins our final round of the mall.
[35:45.160 --> 35:45.400]  All right.
[35:45.680 --> 35:47.420]  Now, this is my regional pick.
[35:47.680 --> 35:52.520]  But it's... and I'm picking because it's very near and dear to me.
[35:52.880 --> 35:56.200]  But I feel like you cannot have a mall...
[35:56.200 --> 36:03.280]  Like, every mall, at least in America, needs, like, a tentpole store.
[36:03.560 --> 36:05.060]  A department store.
[36:05.340 --> 36:06.720]  And everything else kind of feeds...
[36:06.720 --> 36:08.480]  When I was a kid, it was JCPenney's.
[36:08.520 --> 36:09.120]  It was Sears.
[36:09.240 --> 36:10.480]  Eventually, it was Dillard's.
[36:10.740 --> 36:15.980]  It's these big Macy's, these stores where you can go and buy cologne and do your school shopping
[36:15.980 --> 36:19.980]  and maybe get a kitchen item you need, like a pot or a pan or something.
[36:20.120 --> 36:20.760]  And it's all there.
[36:20.980 --> 36:22.040]  Typically, two stories.
[36:22.480 --> 36:24.420]  And it's, like, the one-stop shop for your parents.
[36:24.780 --> 36:25.200]  I bought...
[36:25.880 --> 36:31.920]  Every bit of school clothes I got in middle school and high school that my mom bought me
[36:31.920 --> 36:35.260]  came from this department store in Mobile, Alabama.
[36:36.400 --> 36:36.800]  GAYFERS!
[36:38.720 --> 36:40.960]  Is that really the name of it?
[36:41.520 --> 36:41.740]  What?
[36:41.860 --> 36:42.160]  Yeah.
[36:43.480 --> 36:43.880]  GAYFERS.
[36:44.440 --> 36:45.680]  It eventually became Dillard's.
[36:45.720 --> 36:46.760]  I think they sold to Dillard's.
[36:47.280 --> 36:49.580]  But yeah, when I was growing up in the 80s and the 90s,
[36:49.760 --> 36:54.560]  the big department store you would go to to do all your school shopping was GAYFERS.
[36:55.140 --> 36:58.660]  You know the guy that took that sign down and put up Dillard's kept the first three letters right?
[37:00.820 --> 37:02.460]  Is that the same font as Sony?
[37:02.920 --> 37:03.540]  Is that the same?
[37:05.260 --> 37:06.520]  Oh my god!
[37:07.260 --> 37:09.460]  Well, GAYFERS is a Sony subsidiary, so...
[37:09.460 --> 37:14.720]  You can sub it out with Montgomery Ward or Sears or Dillard's or Macy's or whatever you want to.
[37:14.820 --> 37:16.600]  But in Alabama, it was GAYFERS.
[37:16.980 --> 37:18.200]  So that's my final pick.
[37:18.640 --> 37:24.000]  Big department store, tent pole, like, foundational that you need in every mall.
[37:24.360 --> 37:25.100]  Yeah, great pick.
[37:25.100 --> 37:25.560]  I like it.
[37:25.660 --> 37:31.040]  I think that the thing we've been lacking is big store that...
[37:31.040 --> 37:34.000]  I think that's why TK Maxx is such a good pick.
[37:34.000 --> 37:40.780]  It's a store where you have all this stuff that you need to get, and it's sort of a cornerstone
[37:41.360 --> 37:42.020]  in a mall.
[37:42.600 --> 37:49.000]  It's like when, if you think of Christmas vacation, when Clark goes to the mall to get a gift for
[37:49.660 --> 37:53.280]  Beverly D'Angelo and he's talking to the lady at the perfume counter and stuff, like, it's that.
[37:53.600 --> 37:53.740]  Right?
[37:53.820 --> 37:54.000]  Yeah.
[37:54.540 --> 37:55.040]  You need that.
[37:55.500 --> 37:55.860]  Absolutely.
[37:57.500 --> 38:01.400]  So, I agree that you need that cornerstone shop.
[38:01.400 --> 38:04.160]  You need the thing where you can get all your back to school clothes.
[38:04.260 --> 38:05.780]  You can get jewelry for your wife.
[38:06.080 --> 38:07.200]  You can get a watch.
[38:07.320 --> 38:08.300]  You can get new shorts.
[38:08.440 --> 38:09.660]  You can get all of that stuff.
[38:09.960 --> 38:14.800]  And that's why my pick is the car that you can win in a contest.
[38:17.520 --> 38:19.640]  We've definitely gone in one direction.
[38:20.260 --> 38:21.860]  I'm going the other way.
[38:22.120 --> 38:24.380]  This is the car that you can enter to win.
[38:25.320 --> 38:32.000]  It is, to me, a crucial piece of the mall that you have to walk by and look at and go,
[38:32.100 --> 38:33.200]  how'd they get that in here?
[38:34.820 --> 38:36.020]  Where's the unloading bay?
[38:37.740 --> 38:39.040]  Every mall needs it.
[38:39.600 --> 38:40.760]  Every mall has it.
[38:41.020 --> 38:46.580]  You've never known anyone who's ever won it, but the car still exists within the mall.
[38:46.840 --> 38:50.060]  And that's why it's my fourth and final pick, the car that you can enter to win.
[38:50.760 --> 38:52.000]  Oh, that's a great, great one.
[38:52.140 --> 38:53.800]  It is really a great one.
[38:53.800 --> 38:54.920]  That might be the best one.
[38:55.200 --> 38:55.680]  Thank you.
[38:55.800 --> 38:56.780]  Thank you very much.
[38:58.640 --> 39:01.880]  Nick, your final pick in this mall draft.
[39:02.640 --> 39:05.420]  I'm mad at you because this is a place I feel like you can go to,
[39:05.600 --> 39:08.480]  and if something's wrong, if you need to make a wish,
[39:08.880 --> 39:13.740]  you can go and flip a coin into the old mall fountain.
[39:14.440 --> 39:14.920]  Wow!
[39:15.520 --> 39:16.780]  The mall fountain?
[39:17.420 --> 39:18.240]  The mall fountain.
[39:18.240 --> 39:19.140]  That's great.
[39:19.720 --> 39:20.980]  Wow, that is...
[39:22.160 --> 39:26.200]  Guys, Gavin and Andrew are up against it now.
[39:26.600 --> 39:28.820]  Mall fountain, such a good pick.
[39:29.340 --> 39:29.940]  Wow!
[39:30.980 --> 39:31.580]  Wow!
[39:31.960 --> 39:33.180]  I never would have thought of it, Nick.
[39:33.420 --> 39:39.000]  Nick, you just reminded me that I got a lifetime ban from the mall in Indianapolis
[39:39.700 --> 39:44.100]  because I tied my friend Mike up in the army and threw him in a fountain.
[39:51.380 --> 39:51.980]  Wow.
[39:51.980 --> 39:53.380]  What a thing to trigger.
[39:54.180 --> 39:54.700]  Wow.
[39:54.860 --> 39:56.560]  I'm so glad you went with that, Nick.
[39:56.900 --> 40:00.820]  Mall fountain was on my board as well, but I just didn't know if it was too obscure.
[40:00.880 --> 40:04.100]  I'll share mine when we're doing the submissions we didn't make.
[40:04.580 --> 40:08.180]  I gotta say, the car and the fountain are both just awesome.
[40:08.700 --> 40:09.920]  Real good creative thinking.
[40:10.120 --> 40:13.840]  The picture that you chose also is like...
[40:13.840 --> 40:15.280]  That's the mall.
[40:16.220 --> 40:17.900]  That's the mall.
[40:18.200 --> 40:20.840]  That color, that tone is just so the mall.
[40:20.980 --> 40:21.380]  That dark...
[40:21.380 --> 40:24.160]  Yeah, it looks like the 80s come to life.
[40:25.360 --> 40:28.560]  It's the thing now that kids are like, this is a liminal space.
[40:28.700 --> 40:31.560]  And you're like, no, this is just where we used to go.
[40:32.040 --> 40:34.200]  It's the color palette of my childhood.
[40:34.460 --> 40:35.200]  It really is.
[40:38.100 --> 40:41.920]  Gavin, you're up for your fourth and final pick for this mall draft.
[40:43.540 --> 40:44.220]  All right.
[40:47.100 --> 40:47.480]  You okay?
[40:47.720 --> 40:48.940]  I wanna change floors, all right?
[40:49.240 --> 40:49.680]  Okay.
[40:49.680 --> 40:51.760]  But the escalator is a single.
[40:52.160 --> 40:55.000]  And the down one, the one you want, is somewhere else.
[40:55.240 --> 40:57.220]  Why aren't they twins side by side?
[40:57.460 --> 41:00.060]  I always find the one going the wrong way.
[41:02.900 --> 41:07.900]  So is your pick a single escalator?
[41:07.920 --> 41:11.300]  A single escalator where the other direction is somewhere else.
[41:13.280 --> 41:14.460]  This is a good mall experience.
[41:15.380 --> 41:17.540]  Iconic, iconic mall feature.
[41:19.680 --> 41:21.340]  You are 100% right.
[41:24.320 --> 41:25.360]  All right.
[41:25.440 --> 41:26.780]  So you have your pick.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.760]  Your fourth and final pick is a single escalator going one direction
[41:29.760 --> 41:31.460]  where the other one is somewhere else.
[41:31.880 --> 41:32.420]  Exactly right.
[41:36.900 --> 41:40.940]  After Nick picked Fountain, I went, man, I don't know how they're gonna top it.
[41:41.460 --> 41:42.380]  Congratulations, man.
[41:42.460 --> 41:43.180]  That's great.
[41:43.460 --> 41:47.380]  That's a great pick that is so uniquely a mall.
[41:47.720 --> 41:51.180]  That was a last minute pivot based on yours and Nick's recent picks.
[41:54.260 --> 41:58.500]  I like the idea of being stuck in Gavin's mall and not being able to get out of it.
[41:58.580 --> 42:00.560]  Just constantly going on the wrong escalator.
[42:01.220 --> 42:03.780]  The other one is simply going, it's just somewhere else.
[42:03.860 --> 42:04.560]  You'll find it.
[42:04.700 --> 42:04.860]  Yeah.
[42:05.240 --> 42:05.460]  Yeah.
[42:05.740 --> 42:08.120]  It's just, oh man, what a great...
[42:08.680 --> 42:11.000]  Andrew, you are up.
[42:11.200 --> 42:16.380]  This is your fourth pick and our final pick in our mall draft.
[42:16.940 --> 42:17.940]  These have been...
[42:17.940 --> 42:22.120]  You guys had a great run of mall things that are just like experiential.
[42:22.400 --> 42:24.200]  Like you witnessed them from place to place.
[42:24.700 --> 42:26.500]  There are a lot of great options to choose from.
[42:26.860 --> 42:30.440]  I'm gonna go with one that is so specific to Canada.
[42:30.680 --> 42:32.080]  That is, this is so regional.
[42:32.740 --> 42:35.160]  I think it's also important that we cover food items.
[42:35.220 --> 42:35.840]  I'm going to get into it.
[42:36.040 --> 42:38.980]  I'm going to have to give you guys a little bit of an education of this store
[42:38.980 --> 42:40.960]  because it's bizarre in a wonderful way.
[42:41.020 --> 42:43.080]  My last pick is Zeller's.
[42:43.080 --> 42:48.460]  Now, what makes Zeller's unique is it's like, imagine like a TJ Maxx,
[42:48.480 --> 42:51.820]  but there also is a diner in it for some reason.
[42:51.920 --> 42:52.220]  What?
[42:52.340 --> 42:54.140]  And just the corner of the store.
[42:54.340 --> 42:59.040]  So my like Zeller's experience growing up is you would enter in the Zeller's.
[42:59.120 --> 43:00.420]  It would be like a TJ Maxx.
[43:00.480 --> 43:01.160]  They got the clothes.
[43:01.240 --> 43:02.240]  They got the game section.
[43:02.340 --> 43:02.920]  They got toys.
[43:02.980 --> 43:04.160]  They got all that shit, the snacks.
[43:04.540 --> 43:06.700]  Then if you go to the return section,
[43:06.940 --> 43:10.300]  there is a hole in the wall that looks like Andy Dufresne made it.
[43:10.380 --> 43:11.740]  Like it shouldn't be there.
[43:11.740 --> 43:16.920]  And you step in and it's this old retro style diner.
[43:17.100 --> 43:21.400]  Like you're stepping back in time with like shitty food,
[43:21.620 --> 43:24.300]  but in the best way, like the worst, best burger.
[43:24.560 --> 43:26.540]  For me, it was a grilled cheese and bacon.
[43:26.540 --> 43:27.260]  That was my staple.
[43:27.620 --> 43:32.260]  As like somebody who grew up, like it is the iconic divorced parents place
[43:32.260 --> 43:36.680]  where you got to hang with your dad for like two hours and you're going to get dinner.
[43:36.920 --> 43:38.640]  I spent a lot of time in Zeller's.
[43:38.780 --> 43:40.840]  It's a great, it's a sad,
[43:40.840 --> 43:43.340]  but like good, sad mall place.
[43:43.580 --> 43:46.600]  And it doesn't like it's not just Zeller's itself is the thing.
[43:46.680 --> 43:48.940]  Like there's so much iconic imagery with it.
[43:49.020 --> 43:50.560]  This is like a big part of my childhood.
[43:50.960 --> 43:52.420]  Their mascot was called Zeddy.
[43:52.600 --> 43:55.820]  And they had these fucking things where you sit in the Zeddy chair
[43:55.820 --> 43:57.460]  and it goes around in a circle.
[43:57.620 --> 43:58.620]  And it's just awesome.
[43:59.240 --> 44:00.420]  It's a great, it's a great product.
[44:00.520 --> 44:02.560]  And I have one last thing to share,
[44:02.680 --> 44:05.240]  which I discovered in the history of this.
[44:05.380 --> 44:06.820]  Give me one second to pull up a link.
[44:07.180 --> 44:08.880]  But essentially, I think it's so important.
[44:08.880 --> 44:12.040]  We talked about having a restaurant place in your list.
[44:12.160 --> 44:17.540]  And so having a diner and sort of like a TJ Maxx as like a one-two is perfect.
[44:17.780 --> 44:24.500]  Also, their whole ad campaign was that their prices were the lowest because that was the law.
[44:24.940 --> 44:27.460]  It was like they legally, they had a weird,
[44:27.660 --> 44:30.740]  a judge just approved that we have the lowest prices.
[44:30.960 --> 44:34.720]  So as an honorable man myself, as a respecter of the law,
[44:34.720 --> 44:40.440]  one who prints it, I felt an obligation to depict this.
[44:40.740 --> 44:42.640]  The lowest price is the law.
[44:42.680 --> 44:46.260]  Yeah, it's a very, very strange...
[44:46.260 --> 44:47.920]  Is Zeller's partnered with Walmart?
[44:49.300 --> 44:50.780]  No, they're not.
[44:51.620 --> 44:52.780]  Recently, I don't think so.
[44:52.860 --> 44:55.880]  I don't think that was a big Walmart sign right there in the front of your Zeller's
[44:55.880 --> 44:57.420]  that says, please excuse the tarp.
[44:57.580 --> 45:00.500]  Well, it's probably going to become one because all the signs in Zeller's are closing.
[45:00.500 --> 45:05.060]  They're shacking all the closing signs and the ceiling's gone.
[45:06.120 --> 45:08.300]  So Zeller's closed, but it's back.
[45:08.400 --> 45:12.260]  They just recently brought it back sort of in a bullshit way of inside of a different store.
[45:13.200 --> 45:16.740]  My last thing to share as I was trying to find like good...
[45:16.740 --> 45:20.060]  So it's in a different store with a diner in it?
[45:20.140 --> 45:24.480]  So because it's like such an iconic Canadian staple and people have so
[45:24.480 --> 45:26.880]  much nostalgia for Zeller's, they brought it back.
[45:26.920 --> 45:29.440]  And I believe they're putting it inside of stores called The Bay.
[45:29.440 --> 45:32.080]  I could be wrong about that, but from what I read, that's what they were doing.
[45:32.400 --> 45:35.920]  And then they're doing a food truck outside of it that was like Zeller's items
[45:35.920 --> 45:38.120]  to try to recreate the diner experience.
[45:38.360 --> 45:41.020]  But looking at Zeller's commercials, I have a thing.
[45:41.460 --> 45:43.060]  I think Eric will enjoy this the most.
[45:43.460 --> 45:44.720]  No way! It's Valvenus!
[45:45.280 --> 45:50.880]  There are zero celebrity endorsements from Zeller's outside of this weird Valvenus ad,
[45:51.440 --> 45:52.620]  which I think is great.
[45:52.860 --> 45:54.780]  So if you want to watch that very quickly, it's very brief.
[45:57.080 --> 45:58.160]  Valvenus is Canadian.
[45:58.720 --> 45:59.560]  That makes sense.
[45:59.800 --> 46:03.040]  I like that he just drives around in a convertible with no shirt on.
[46:03.200 --> 46:03.600]  Yeah, absolutely.
[46:03.600 --> 46:04.420]  No shirt, just like glasses.
[46:05.520 --> 46:06.420]  Sunglasses are great.
[46:08.860 --> 46:09.880]  He's trying to get in.
[46:09.960 --> 46:11.220]  Yeah, he's just trying to get his duct tags.
[46:12.460 --> 46:16.340]  I mean, just so we're all on the same page here on who Valvenus was,
[46:16.700 --> 46:21.820]  his gimmick in the 90s was that he was a porn star
[46:23.580 --> 46:25.560]  who was also a professional wrestler.
[46:26.740 --> 46:27.900]  Was he actually a porn star?
[46:28.160 --> 46:30.080]  No, but that was the gimmick.
[46:30.240 --> 46:32.640]  So who do you think won this draft?
[46:33.560 --> 46:36.320]  I like how off the rails the last round went.
[46:36.620 --> 46:38.100]  Me too, I really like that.
[46:38.540 --> 46:41.660]  But that's important for a last round because you're not letting anything go.
[46:42.000 --> 46:43.860]  Let's go over the draft board.
[46:44.340 --> 46:52.380]  Andrew, your mall is Spencer's Gifts, GameStop, Avalon slash Landmark Theatre, and Zeller's.
[46:53.340 --> 46:55.320]  It's sort of like Geoff in the last draft.
[46:55.320 --> 46:59.000]  I love my mall, but that's because it's just things that I love.
[46:59.160 --> 46:59.820]  It's my ideal mall.
[47:01.480 --> 47:08.840]  Gavin's mall is Greg's, TK Maxx, Staples,
[47:09.400 --> 47:13.880]  and a single escalator going one direction where the other one is somewhere else.
[47:15.180 --> 47:15.980]  Very mall.
[47:16.380 --> 47:16.680]  Solid.
[47:16.860 --> 47:17.700]  It's all very mall.
[47:18.200 --> 47:23.100]  I will say I would want to spend the least amount of time in Gavin's mall, but it is very mall.
[47:23.340 --> 47:24.180]  You know what? That's fair.
[47:24.960 --> 47:33.280]  Uh, Nick's mall, Brookstone, Auntie Anne's, Yankee Candle, and the mall fountain.
[47:33.920 --> 47:37.140]  You know what's an underrated part of the mall fountain that we didn't talk about at the time?
[47:37.400 --> 47:41.240]  That really overly powerful chlorine smell you get from the fountain.
[47:41.760 --> 47:44.100]  I think Nick has the best smells.
[47:44.300 --> 47:46.620]  He has the nicest smelling mall by far.
[47:47.260 --> 47:47.540]  Yeah.
[47:48.240 --> 47:56.400]  Um, my mall is AMC Theaters, McDonald's, Suncoast, and the car you can enter to win.
[47:56.720 --> 47:58.940]  That's good. That's a good one. That's a really good mall.
[47:59.540 --> 48:02.880]  I feel like there's plenty to do at my mall. It's, uh, I feel good about it.
[48:03.020 --> 48:05.900]  Um, you might win a car. It's a great contest.
[48:06.240 --> 48:13.900]  And, uh, Geoff's mall, Orange Julius, Camelot Music, Aladdin's Castle, and Gafers.
[48:15.040 --> 48:17.400]  Now, great, great picks.
[48:17.820 --> 48:18.300]  Yes.
[48:19.080 --> 48:23.100]  I feel like also some of your picks lack the brand recognition of, like,
[48:23.120 --> 48:26.980]  I'm not familiar with the Aladdin's Castle, but the idea of a giant arcade in the mall,
[48:27.060 --> 48:27.880]  I fucking love that.
[48:27.960 --> 48:32.120]  I mean, just because you don't understand the brand, Aladdin's Castle was the largest
[48:33.320 --> 48:35.660]  arcade chain in the world, probably.
[48:35.880 --> 48:40.260]  It's like, there's huge brand recognition. You just don't recognize it.
[48:40.260 --> 48:45.020]  I've realized my mall is a list of stores that you walk past while you're trying to
[48:45.020 --> 48:46.060]  find the other escalator.
[48:46.340 --> 48:50.480]  That's, I mean, that's absolutely, it's just one big circle where it keeps happening.
[48:50.840 --> 48:51.660]  Oh, you're in a loop.
[48:52.160 --> 48:57.700]  Yeah. Uh, that's unfortunate, but that is what it is. And I, you know, that's totally fine.
[48:57.760 --> 48:57.920]  Yeah.
[48:57.920 --> 48:58.720]  That's totally fine.
[48:59.140 --> 49:00.440]  Geoff's stuff can be found throughout history.
[49:01.120 --> 49:03.220]  Julius, Camelot, Aladdin.
[49:03.520 --> 49:06.900]  Geoff's, Geoff's stuff is all like...
[49:08.500 --> 49:09.160]  Sir Gafer.
[49:09.160 --> 49:16.760]  It's, it's all 80s movie stuff. Like, Geoff's mall is what Terminator 2 looks like.
[49:17.040 --> 49:20.200]  Well, Terminator 2 is what the mall looked like in the 80s.
[49:20.260 --> 49:21.180]  Yeah, exactly.
[49:21.500 --> 49:23.520]  Luckily they didn't get stuck on the single escalator though.
[49:23.860 --> 49:24.240]  That's true.
[49:24.460 --> 49:26.700]  Oh man, what a fight secrets that would have been.
[49:27.400 --> 49:32.480]  Speaking of Terminator 2, I found in the course of my research, I found a short one minute and
[49:32.480 --> 49:40.800]  44 second clip of a chase scene that was in a movie filmed in 1994 through one of my high school
[49:40.800 --> 49:41.520]  malls.
[49:41.520 --> 49:42.020]  Oh, wow.
[49:42.360 --> 49:43.560]  Share that with you guys if you want to see it.
[49:43.600 --> 49:45.620]  It's maybe the most boring chase scene of all times.
[49:46.080 --> 49:46.760]  There you go.
[49:47.880 --> 49:52.340]  Oh, this is called Springdale Mall Motorcycle Chase Scene from Raw Justice.
[49:52.680 --> 49:52.880]  Yeah.
[49:53.660 --> 49:54.440]  Oh, this music.
[49:56.920 --> 49:57.320]  Wow.
[49:57.540 --> 50:01.160]  So this would have been filmed while I was in high school, probably.
[50:01.800 --> 50:02.200]  Wow.
[50:03.380 --> 50:05.680]  Did you have any idea they were filming a movie at your mall?
[50:06.080 --> 50:07.560]  I don't think so, no.
[50:08.040 --> 50:08.940]  Ooh, that saxophone.
[50:09.520 --> 50:11.620]  There's one great line of dialogue about halfway through.
[50:13.080 --> 50:14.860]  Oh, he's opening the big door.
[50:15.140 --> 50:15.920]  He doesn't even realize.
[50:16.460 --> 50:17.180]  It's pretty good.
[50:17.440 --> 50:18.720]  Doesn't even realize motorcycles are coming.
[50:19.220 --> 50:19.340]  Yeah.
[50:19.860 --> 50:21.480]  It's your reaction to it either.
[50:21.580 --> 50:22.260]  That's fantastic.
[50:23.220 --> 50:24.540]  This is so cool.
[50:25.040 --> 50:25.740]  That's your mall, huh?
[50:25.880 --> 50:26.800]  Get a reward, man.
[50:26.860 --> 50:27.580]  This is your mall.
[50:27.620 --> 50:27.980]  Oh, yeah.
[50:28.120 --> 50:28.700]  Where's the fountain?
[50:29.280 --> 50:30.320]  There's my fountain.
[50:30.700 --> 50:30.920]  Yep.
[50:30.920 --> 50:32.800]  This is legitimately my mall.
[50:33.300 --> 50:34.160]  What was that shot of?
[50:34.640 --> 50:38.780]  Oh, that's kind of stylish.
[50:38.960 --> 50:39.940]  The wheel to the other bike.
[50:41.100 --> 50:42.300]  This is, uh...
[50:42.300 --> 50:44.480]  I think I might have to watch Raw Justice.
[50:50.300 --> 50:52.820]  Did you get to the pullover dumb shit line?
[50:53.080 --> 50:53.300]  Yeah.
[50:53.500 --> 50:53.600]  Yep.
[50:53.960 --> 50:54.220]  Yeah.
[50:54.820 --> 50:55.460]  That was very good.
[50:55.740 --> 50:55.980]  Dude.
[50:56.280 --> 50:57.120]  It's the fucking best.
[50:57.140 --> 51:00.220]  If you're doing the same thing as what the other dumb shit is doing, you're a dumb shit.
[51:01.840 --> 51:04.300]  It's GQ store, whatever the fuck that is.
[51:05.420 --> 51:07.360]  You might be able to see Gafers in this.
[51:07.940 --> 51:09.480]  Just on the floor shot.
[51:10.700 --> 51:11.740]  What the...
[51:11.740 --> 51:13.440]  Oh, dude, this rules.
[51:13.620 --> 51:15.420]  This is the slowest chase I've ever seen.
[51:16.840 --> 51:19.320]  The one dude just fucking eats shit for no reason.
[51:20.360 --> 51:21.420]  Next to Gafers!
[51:26.240 --> 51:26.760]  Dude.
[51:28.160 --> 51:28.680]  That's...
[51:28.680 --> 51:30.760]  Why did they film this in Mobile, Alabama?
[51:30.920 --> 51:33.140]  Probably it was free, I would assume.
[51:36.400 --> 51:38.980]  Anyway, I thought that was a great little piece of history.
[51:39.140 --> 51:40.340]  Also, I found some funny stuff.
[51:41.180 --> 51:43.320]  You associate the Gap with the mall, right?
[51:43.400 --> 51:44.500]  Like, I think about the Gap constantly.
[51:44.980 --> 51:47.220]  Did you know the Gap used to look this fucking lame?
[51:47.700 --> 51:49.520]  I found this fucking photo of the Gap.
[51:49.540 --> 51:49.980]  Oh, my God.
[51:49.980 --> 51:50.520]  Oh, wow.
[51:51.120 --> 51:51.180]  Oh, my God.
[51:51.380 --> 51:51.600]  That's so ugly.
[51:51.600 --> 51:52.600]  That is not how I feel.
[51:52.700 --> 51:54.520]  That's not how you associate the Gap with the mall, right?
[51:54.520 --> 51:55.420]  No, not at all.
[51:55.460 --> 51:58.360]  That's definitely before all of its rebrand and everything, right?
[51:58.360 --> 52:01.280]  Did it start as just a space between two stores?
[52:02.060 --> 52:03.800]  That's a funny joke.
[52:04.600 --> 52:05.560]  No, I mean...
[52:08.390 --> 52:09.710]  No, I never thought about it.
[52:09.750 --> 52:10.090]  And I was thinking...
[52:10.090 --> 52:12.870]  Just looks like two walls of other stores, and they just put clothes in it.
[52:13.130 --> 52:13.770]  Definitely does.
[52:13.770 --> 52:15.430]  That'd be such a cool origin to that name.
[52:16.590 --> 52:17.430]  KB Toys.
[52:17.530 --> 52:19.790]  And then the other one I had was Walden Books.
[52:19.950 --> 52:20.650]  Oh, those ones you're on?
[52:20.790 --> 52:22.390]  KB Toys is such a good one.
[52:23.890 --> 52:30.090]  I feel like one that we didn't pick, but largely because I think it's maybe not...
[52:30.110 --> 52:33.250]  anyone hears, like, demographic.
[52:34.550 --> 52:38.430]  But it's a mall staple is Hot Topic.
[52:38.590 --> 52:39.490]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[52:40.030 --> 52:44.370]  Huge store. It feels like it's the only reason people go to the mall right now.
[52:46.350 --> 52:47.870]  But I don't know, man.
[52:48.050 --> 52:52.110]  It was on my list, and I just couldn't pull the trigger on it.
[52:52.430 --> 52:56.850]  I was going to go for a Lush just so it would waft into the main area.
[52:56.930 --> 52:58.950]  I didn't want to go in because it's too powerful.
[52:58.950 --> 53:01.710]  But I think that'd be nice for the nearby stores.
[53:02.210 --> 53:07.930]  Another one that was regional for me was a place called Mervin's, California.
[53:07.930 --> 53:09.130]  Oh, that logo.
[53:09.410 --> 53:09.990]  Look at that.
[53:10.210 --> 53:11.170]  Oh, Mervin's.
[53:12.490 --> 53:13.610]  Mervin's, California.
[53:14.190 --> 53:21.210]  Everything about that logo was, oh, we're going back to school and we need to get new clothes.
[53:21.670 --> 53:24.890]  You know, what's interesting about that is Mervin's is a nationwide chain.
[53:24.890 --> 53:29.930]  So you got the, like, Texas-ized version of it where they localized it to you.
[53:30.350 --> 53:32.250]  I bet AC Slater shopped there.
[53:32.590 --> 53:35.010]  Doesn't it look like Saved by the Bell?
[53:35.210 --> 53:36.030]  Like, big time.
[53:36.270 --> 53:36.570]  It does.
[53:37.410 --> 53:44.830]  I also had a... I didn't pick it, but I was close.
[53:45.450 --> 53:51.570]  And it was the little train that you can ride at the mall.
[53:51.570 --> 53:52.350]  Oh, yeah.
[53:52.990 --> 53:59.650]  I just felt like the car that you can enter to win was a stronger choice.
[53:59.870 --> 54:03.570]  But train at the mall is definitely... like, that's a big one.
[54:03.990 --> 54:04.490]  Holy shit.
[54:04.550 --> 54:06.710]  I just googled what happened to Aladdin's Castle.
[54:07.090 --> 54:11.890]  The last Aladdin's Castle closed in May of 2020 in Quincy, Illinois.
[54:12.330 --> 54:14.730]  They were at a tight... pandemic did them in.
[54:14.750 --> 54:18.710]  There were 450 locations throughout malls in America until the news.
[54:19.250 --> 54:19.870]  Oh, bummer.
[54:20.510 --> 54:21.390]  That was a great draft.
[54:21.570 --> 54:23.190]  That was a really good one.
[54:23.530 --> 54:25.090]  That was a really fun draft.
[54:25.290 --> 54:29.490]  The mall... I think these malls... we'll leave it up to the people to decide.
[54:29.810 --> 54:32.330]  Do you guys have any standouts that you thought were the winner,
[54:32.430 --> 54:33.450]  or do we leave it just to the people?
[54:33.830 --> 54:34.670]  I think we leave it to the people.
[54:34.770 --> 54:35.610]  I think we leave it to the people.
[54:36.050 --> 54:36.550]  For sure.
[54:36.590 --> 54:38.650]  I mean, I think everybody's mall is personal to them.
[54:38.850 --> 54:40.990]  So, like, clearly, I think I had the best.
[54:41.290 --> 54:43.430]  But, you know, I'm sure Andrew thinks he had the best.
[54:43.670 --> 54:44.690]  Yeah, the mall is back.
[54:45.310 --> 54:46.330]  The mall is back.
[54:46.890 --> 54:47.690]  The mall is back.
[54:48.410 --> 54:49.630]  Some malls are back.
[54:51.970 --> 54:53.510]  Is Colonel's... is that everywhere?
[54:54.210 --> 54:55.290]  Is that is that one that shared?
[54:55.450 --> 54:56.230]  Or is that a local thing?
[54:56.390 --> 54:57.390]  Like it's a popcorn.
[54:57.730 --> 55:00.750]  It's like a sunglass kiosk, but they only sell popcorn.
[55:01.210 --> 55:02.670]  It's like a mall staple here.
[55:02.750 --> 55:04.670]  But I didn't know if that was region specific.
[55:05.230 --> 55:05.490]  Never.
[55:05.730 --> 55:06.250]  I never shared.
[55:06.370 --> 55:08.850]  I meant to share the before we move on.
[55:09.190 --> 55:12.990]  My mall has a great what I feel at least a great fountain.
[55:13.210 --> 55:15.450]  They recently got rid of it, which is really sad.
[55:15.530 --> 55:18.610]  But this was a staple of the biggest mall where I live.
[55:19.150 --> 55:19.390]  Water.
[55:19.550 --> 55:20.650]  It's a whole like clock tower.
[55:20.650 --> 55:22.370]  Water thing, which is great.
[55:22.550 --> 55:23.270]  That's really cool.
[55:23.350 --> 55:24.330]  That's really cool.
[55:24.710 --> 55:25.170]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[55:25.410 --> 55:29.570]  It's now just like a stupid LCD board that you can like step on and it lights up.
[55:29.670 --> 55:30.130]  It's dumb.
[55:30.350 --> 55:33.170]  Was was the clock powered by water or something?
[55:33.310 --> 55:33.890]  I believe so.
[55:34.010 --> 55:35.370]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[55:35.570 --> 55:37.010]  Oh, there's kernels in the background, too.
[55:37.230 --> 55:38.670]  Yeah, there's currently exactly.
[55:39.730 --> 55:41.110]  I didn't even mean to do that.
[55:41.630 --> 55:44.590]  The other one I didn't pick, but I feel like is a very much a mall staple.
[55:44.750 --> 55:47.110]  At least I once again don't know if this is regional lids.
[55:47.530 --> 55:48.170]  The hat.
[55:48.170 --> 55:51.410]  Oh, yeah, I feel like every mall has a lids.
[55:51.830 --> 55:55.570]  Every month, a lot of the malls in America have two or three lids, if I'm being honest with you.
[55:55.590 --> 55:57.250]  Yeah, there's like a lids on each floor.
[55:57.790 --> 56:02.490]  Do you guys have a picture of what your mall look like from the outside?
[56:02.710 --> 56:04.930]  Oh, let me like not not the one that we just drafted.
[56:04.990 --> 56:07.270]  But like, yeah, like the mall that you would go to all the time.
[56:08.330 --> 56:09.750]  Like, do you have like an image of that?
[56:09.970 --> 56:11.330]  I probably can find one.
[56:11.670 --> 56:12.230]  There it is.
[56:13.090 --> 56:14.670]  What is the name of your mall?
[56:14.930 --> 56:15.630]  Ingram Park.
[56:16.350 --> 56:17.270]  Ingram Park Mall.
[56:17.270 --> 56:17.970]  Huh.
[56:20.930 --> 56:23.890]  We had that's the Bel Air Mall.
[56:24.030 --> 56:24.990]  Oh, that's the Bel Air Mall.
[56:25.170 --> 56:26.150]  Yeah, nice.
[56:26.250 --> 56:27.070]  It's so bright looking.
[56:28.050 --> 56:33.010]  We had the beautiful Parkway Plaza.
[56:33.190 --> 56:33.930]  Oh, that's awesome.
[56:34.570 --> 56:35.190]  That looks great.
[56:35.330 --> 56:39.650]  That is that's the mall that I spent all my time when I was a kid.
[56:40.410 --> 56:41.910]  Gavin, did you have like indoor malls?
[56:42.470 --> 56:46.590]  Uh, yeah, let me my my primary indoor mall.
[56:46.770 --> 56:47.530]  Woodgrove Center.
[56:48.350 --> 56:50.050]  It's the big one on Nanaimo.
[56:50.330 --> 56:51.950]  Oh, wow.
[56:52.390 --> 56:54.530]  Wow, that's that's impressive.
[56:55.210 --> 56:57.110]  It looks kind of like a TIE fighter.
[56:58.230 --> 56:58.970]  Oh, wow.
[56:59.910 --> 57:01.610]  Mine was Friars Square.
[57:02.150 --> 57:03.950]  Friars Square is a great.
[57:04.310 --> 57:06.070]  That's so British, dude.
[57:06.150 --> 57:10.550]  And when I was a kid, I used to love running through that bridge because it was like kind
[57:10.550 --> 57:11.510]  of boingy.
[57:11.510 --> 57:12.670]  Oh, yeah.
[57:12.990 --> 57:14.710]  And it was like a little bit springy on the floor.
[57:15.270 --> 57:17.590]  Guys, this was a very good draft.
[57:18.310 --> 57:24.270]  I'm really excited to see what when we leave it to the people, what they choose as the
[57:24.270 --> 57:24.850]  winning mall.
[57:25.110 --> 57:27.710]  But this was a really successful draft.
[57:27.770 --> 57:28.490]  I like this a lot.
[57:28.830 --> 57:29.850]  So we've done falls.
[57:30.370 --> 57:31.890]  We've done rocks, but not rocks.
[57:31.930 --> 57:33.250]  We've done malls.
[57:33.530 --> 57:34.990]  Who knows what's next?
[57:36.470 --> 57:38.750]  You still want to do falls again, Gavin?
[57:39.210 --> 57:40.430]  Or is that big time?
[57:40.430 --> 57:41.150]  A big time.
[57:41.750 --> 57:42.810]  Let's do walls.
[57:42.970 --> 57:44.550]  I got dibs on a great wall of China.
[57:44.890 --> 57:45.890]  Oh, man.
[57:48.050 --> 57:49.690]  Um, well, that that's it.
[57:49.730 --> 57:51.150]  I think I think that's the end of our draft.
[57:51.210 --> 57:52.110]  Great malls.
[57:52.230 --> 57:54.270]  Any any parting thoughts?
[57:54.350 --> 57:57.270]  Any final words about malls or to these people listening?
[57:57.830 --> 57:59.250]  No, nope.
[58:00.050 --> 58:02.170]  If you haven't, but thanks for asking, Eric.
[58:02.190 --> 58:02.390]  I do.
[58:02.670 --> 58:08.270]  If you haven't been if you feel nostalgia, nostalgia towards malls, you remember enjoying
[58:08.270 --> 58:09.310]  them in your in your youth.
[58:09.310 --> 58:13.870]  Or maybe you have never been to a mall and you don't know what all the hubbub is about.
[58:14.830 --> 58:19.250]  Google mall in your town and take a take a gander, walk around and see.
[58:19.350 --> 58:20.110]  You might be surprised.
[58:20.270 --> 58:21.870]  The malls malls are back in some places.
[58:22.010 --> 58:23.110]  They're definitely not in others.
[58:23.310 --> 58:24.690]  But they you might be surprised.
[58:24.790 --> 58:27.390]  The mall might be back in your very town and you didn't even know it.
[58:27.730 --> 58:28.290]  I actually do.
[58:28.890 --> 58:32.330]  Now that you've said something, Geoff, you just made me think I'd love to hear what like
[58:32.330 --> 58:34.150]  regional things people have for their malls.
[58:34.490 --> 58:37.750]  Like, I want to know what what their equivalent is, is Ellers or whatever.
[58:37.750 --> 58:38.770]  I'd love to see that.
[58:39.310 --> 58:40.010]  Let us know.
[58:40.170 --> 58:42.750]  Tweet at us at FacePod.
[58:42.990 --> 58:48.510]  And you can also follow us on Instagram and let us know who won this mall draft because
[58:48.510 --> 58:49.370]  we will have polls.
[58:50.510 --> 58:52.350]  But thank you very much for listening.
[58:52.610 --> 58:54.870]  This has been a face draft.
[58:55.050 --> 58:56.130]  And now we're done.
[58:56.690 --> 58:57.150]  Bye.
