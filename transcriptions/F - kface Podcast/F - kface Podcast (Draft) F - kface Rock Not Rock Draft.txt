[00:00.000 --> 00:01.240]  You ever wonder why we're here?
[00:06.220 --> 00:08.540]  It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?
[00:19.130 --> 00:19.910]  3, 2, 1, go!
[00:20.450 --> 00:25.910]  3, 2, 1, go! We're here! It is the Rocks That Aren't Rock Draft, the thing that Gavin hates the most.
[00:26.290 --> 00:31.710]  Gavin, why do you hate this? Why have you constantly shit on this, both publicly and behind the scenes?
[00:32.110 --> 00:36.950]  Well, I was like 7 out of 10 on the draft format, because I kind of don't get it anyway.
[00:37.310 --> 00:37.910]  That's the point!
[00:38.270 --> 00:41.910]  Yeah, and now we're not drafting stuff that we can watch as funny clips.
[00:42.230 --> 00:46.910]  So, uh, I'm like 5 out of 10 on this, but look, prove me wrong. I will be proven wrong.
[00:47.070 --> 00:47.910]  This is gonna be amazing.
[00:48.550 --> 00:52.870]  I'm excited to see what you'd pick, because it just seemed like your heart, not that your heart wasn't in it,
[00:52.910 --> 00:56.910]  but you seem lost. You seem very confused in what makes a good pick.
[00:57.190 --> 01:00.750]  My heart is all the way in, and I'm just as confused as I was last time.
[01:01.610 --> 01:06.170]  Can I ask you a question with your heart all the way in? Yeah. This is all built...
[01:06.170 --> 01:14.190]  Well, first off, let's assume that rocks are the same everywhere, but I'm curious about, like, your mall experiences in England,
[01:14.330 --> 01:18.590]  and I know that'll be the next video, but, like, do, like, the way we had malls in America and Canada,
[01:18.710 --> 01:22.270]  do they have those in England? Or is it all just, like, Herod's, like that?
[01:22.490 --> 01:29.010]  No, no, we have them. I would say most of them aren't as big as the vast beige expanses that you have, but...
[01:29.010 --> 01:33.450]  Are you talking about, are you guys talking about the mall draft during the rock? Not rock draft?
[01:33.450 --> 01:35.830]  Yeah, we're just, you know, talking about drafts in general.
[01:36.170 --> 01:40.030]  No, we're not talking about drafts in general. We're talking about malls in specific.
[01:40.590 --> 01:43.770]  We should get into the rock draft. Eric's got an excellent point. And before... I know!
[01:44.110 --> 01:48.990]  Before we mention the rock draft, I have to, I have to preface this by saying something that you are going to hear me say
[01:48.990 --> 01:53.930]  every recording from here on until it happens. The fucking...
[01:54.570 --> 01:57.770]  Austin, Texas deserves an NBA team. We proved it last night.
[01:58.190 --> 02:05.870]  Get your shit together. Rich billionaires in Austin, buy us a fucking team. The city needs it. Okay, rock draft, go. Okay.
[02:06.170 --> 02:08.650]  Why don't we, so for the draft order, we can either do it random,
[02:09.270 --> 02:13.570]  or we can have Nick set the order, because he won the last draft. Ooh. I'm happy with either.
[02:14.110 --> 02:16.090]  Can we set up what we're doing?
[02:16.870 --> 02:21.730]  We're doing a rock, we're drafting rocks that aren't rocks. Three, two, one, go. I feel like it's pretty simple.
[02:22.290 --> 02:29.890]  If you watched, if you watched, it's not mall draft. It's the same principle. Who is coming into this as an entry point?
[02:30.070 --> 02:33.810]  We have to, but we have to treat it like it's an entry point. It's going out.
[02:33.810 --> 02:36.130]  Well, this is, we're gonna have a snake draft.
[02:36.310 --> 02:43.570]  We're drafting things that are rock related, as in they have the name rock, but are not actually rocks. And what have we established
[02:44.290 --> 02:50.170]  before? Is the moon? The moon doesn't count. The moon is not a rock, is what we've decided. I disagree.
[02:50.550 --> 02:54.030]  I think the moon is a rock. No, no, he decided the moon was out, and also pet rocks out.
[02:54.450 --> 02:59.110]  Yeah, we can't do the moon and pet rocks. They're pet rocks. Because they are rocks. They're rocks. Because they are rocks.
[02:59.170 --> 03:02.150]  Yeah, yeah. I have a feeling that as we go,
[03:02.150 --> 03:05.670]  one thing is going to be a rock and will cause an argument.
[03:06.510 --> 03:09.430]  That'd be great. Not on my, not on my watch. Okay.
[03:09.990 --> 03:10.390]  So.
[03:10.990 --> 03:19.050]  Or I have random.org here ready to randomize. Do it, do it, do it. Or, or Nick chooses the order.
[03:19.250 --> 03:24.150]  Okay, Nick is saying do random. But that makes me want to have Nick do it even more. The fact that he's so adamant
[03:24.150 --> 03:25.590]  that it should be random.
[03:26.330 --> 03:29.830]  Poor Nick. That's a lot of pressure. That's a lot of pressure. We could do it.
[03:30.130 --> 03:31.530]  Uh, who do you think lost the last draft?
[03:32.230 --> 03:33.950]  I don't know. Probably me.
[03:34.390 --> 03:40.350]  I have no idea. Nobody's. I, I went for hyper specific, uh, falls that were only on TikTok in my feed in a year.
[03:40.430 --> 03:44.370]  So I didn't. Yeah, did we do a poll? Like, was there a vote or was it just people commenting?
[03:44.490 --> 03:50.030]  No, just commenting. I think it was pretty, pretty roundly, uh, decided that Nick won though. Yeah. Yeah.
[03:50.350 --> 03:53.150]  Okay. It seemed to be a good consensus. I definitely feel like I did worst.
[03:53.590 --> 03:58.790]  Okay, in that case, why don't we do, Geoff, since you're admittedly the worst, you go first.
[03:58.790 --> 04:04.610]  So we'll do like, you know, that way you get the advantage this time around. And then since I've won, I'll go last.
[04:05.130 --> 04:05.530]  Okay.
[04:06.230 --> 04:10.350]  And now you just have to fill in the other three. Okay, so I'm going to randomly pick. Here we go.
[04:10.930 --> 04:11.870]  Gavin, Andrew, Eric.
[04:12.410 --> 04:13.990]  How did you randomly pick? Oh, sick.
[04:14.870 --> 04:16.330]  Gavin, Andrew, hang on.
[04:16.350 --> 04:18.450]  He just said names and whatever came out of his mouth.
[04:18.750 --> 04:24.970]  I want this to be known. I don't have a problem with what has happened. Does not bother me whatsoever.
[04:24.970 --> 04:29.950]  I do want to say that you said I'll randomly pick and then just said names.
[04:30.210 --> 04:34.050]  You did not. You didn't.
[04:35.770 --> 04:37.450]  I take it back. Eric goes last.
[04:41.450 --> 04:47.610]  Um, what, what I'm going to share with you guys right now is here is our
[04:48.750 --> 04:53.090]  spreadsheet where we have, I can fill this in. Don't feel like you need to.
[04:53.090 --> 04:58.830]  Uh, I can with our things. It is just, it's there for your convenience to look at.
[04:59.030 --> 05:03.110]  And then when we're done, we'll post an image of the whole thing. Perfect. That that'll be it.
[05:03.290 --> 05:08.210]  So now we know that Geoff is going first. Gavin is going second. Andrew is going third.
[05:08.310 --> 05:12.990]  I'm going fourth. Nick is going fifth. And then with snake draft rules,
[05:13.410 --> 05:18.210]  Nick will go first in the next round and we'll reverse the order. There are four slots.
[05:18.470 --> 05:20.170]  We are doing four choices.
[05:20.170 --> 05:25.970]  So that is how many rock, not rocks we are drafting in this rock, not rock draft.
[05:28.710 --> 05:35.910]  Did I, is that laid out well? You nailed it. It's good. Excruciating detail. Okay. That is, it's so,
[05:36.150 --> 05:41.610]  to say it's necessary, I think is an understatement. I know. You're right. You're right. So,
[05:42.230 --> 05:42.590]  uh,
[05:43.410 --> 05:45.750]  Geoff, you are our first
[05:45.750 --> 05:47.630]  pick. You are up.
[05:47.630 --> 05:53.890]  All right, I'm going to share my screen because I prepared a slideshow. Uh, so can you guys see?
[05:54.630 --> 06:00.470]  Yes. I don't know how it works. You can see a picture of my rock, not rock draft. That's my cover sheet. Watch the screen.
[06:00.770 --> 06:05.270]  That's great. You can see that. It's a picture of the rock holding a giant boulder.
[06:06.090 --> 06:06.890]  Nine slides.
[06:07.670 --> 06:08.870]  Uh, yeah, I brought in slides.
[06:09.010 --> 06:14.150]  So, uh, I'm going to show you now two slides. The first slide and then, uh, is my rock, my first rock pick,
[06:14.150 --> 06:19.970]  and then some fun facts about it. So first rock pick I picked, can you see that? Rock candy. Good pick.
[06:20.170 --> 06:22.770]  I picked it because, and I say it's yummy. That's the tagline.
[06:23.130 --> 06:29.730]  Uh, rock candy. I hope nobody else picked it. Sorry if you did. I'm a big fan of rock candy. And here's five
[06:29.730 --> 06:37.630]  facts about rock candy. Number one, rock candy is readily available in the gift shops of all roadside attractions in America. Number two,
[06:38.030 --> 06:43.010]  rock candy originated in Iran and India where it was used to sweeten tea.
[06:43.010 --> 06:48.630]  Did you know that fact number three states that in the Netherlands it is often baked into a special bread?
[06:49.070 --> 06:54.910]  And number four, it was originally popularized in the 1800s as a cold remedy. That sounds ludicrous.
[06:55.090 --> 07:02.710]  And then the fifth and final fact about rock candy, it is rich in carbohydrates and high in calories. You need calories to survive.
[07:03.510 --> 07:03.990]  I...
[07:03.990 --> 07:09.630]  First, let me just say, Geoff, I love that you've done a presentation. I think that's great. I want to give you credit there.
[07:09.630 --> 07:17.530]  I hate to do this. That is a dog shit. Number one. Terrible. Rock not rock pick. Yep, absolutely.
[07:18.130 --> 07:19.390]  I have rock candy.
[07:20.050 --> 07:25.150]  He pulled the stream down. It is maybe like 15th on my list.
[07:25.830 --> 07:30.150]  And I would maybe take that. It's a long shot for me. I respect you like it.
[07:30.510 --> 07:32.530]  But it is not. I can't believe you got shit on the first thing you did.
[07:32.530 --> 07:35.270]  I mean, here's what I'm not going to do.
[07:35.330 --> 07:38.410]  I'm not going to shit on anybody else's rocks that are important to them.
[07:38.410 --> 07:40.690]  I've been eating rock candy since I was a child.
[07:41.070 --> 07:44.750]  If you were in America and you got to go to like a cave or some shit,
[07:44.850 --> 07:49.010]  you were very excited at the end of it to get the treat of rock candy at the gift store.
[07:49.430 --> 07:55.410]  Rock candy to me is an American fucking staple. It's also apparently a staple in India and Iran and the Netherlands.
[07:55.830 --> 08:00.790]  So suck my rock candy. I how dare you? How dare you insult rock candy?
[08:00.910 --> 08:04.830]  You're just sad that I thought of it and I picked it and I picked it first because
[08:04.830 --> 08:09.090]  it'll be a cold day in hell before any of you guys pick my next rocks.
[08:09.270 --> 08:13.250]  I guarantee you that. I had to get the obvious one out of the way. See, I thought
[08:13.730 --> 08:16.390]  I thought that's like a sixth round. You would qualify
[08:16.930 --> 08:21.110]  rock candy as important to you? I had it a bunch when I was a kid.
[08:22.490 --> 08:26.130]  Kid stuff's important. I mean, I'm not going to attack what is or isn't important to him,
[08:26.210 --> 08:29.110]  but it's just it's like a mid-tier candy at best.
[08:30.290 --> 08:36.650]  It's okay. It's lower than that. It's oh, it's a dog shit candy, but it's called rock candy and it comes in.
[08:36.790 --> 08:43.830]  It's just fucking crystallized sugar on a stick. It's ludicrous, but that's the point of it. How? You negative motherfuckers.
[08:44.070 --> 08:45.550]  Let's see. All right, who's next?
[08:46.570 --> 08:51.150]  Yeah, Gavin, you are you are next. Don't feel like you have to provide a slideshow in five facts.
[08:51.210 --> 08:52.290]  You can just give us your pick.
[08:53.130 --> 08:57.150]  I'm, sorry. I want this video to take longer than four fucking minutes. No, I love the slideshow, Jack.
[08:57.150 --> 08:58.390]  All right, I posted mine.
[08:59.290 --> 08:59.890]  Crack. What is that?
[09:00.850 --> 09:05.630]  Oh, crack. You're going crack. Your number one pick is crack? Yeah.
[09:06.070 --> 09:10.270]  Yep, there you go. Way better than rock candy. Congratulations.
[09:11.310 --> 09:12.190]  How about it?
[09:13.170 --> 09:19.390]  Rock candy was great, Geoff. You went crack first. Why? Why are you taking this to the first round? Crack rock.
[09:19.910 --> 09:23.090]  I had it at least a seventh round grade for crack rock.
[09:23.950 --> 09:26.530]  I don't understand. No, I thought that'd be um,
[09:27.050 --> 09:30.110]  some backlash because technically it's a rock, right?
[09:30.470 --> 09:34.450]  Yeah, I just think it's a terrible pick so I don't really need to fight like I'm not gonna protest.
[09:34.570 --> 09:39.490]  You have a crack rock. You can have crack rock. What is your problem? Why? How are we doing this wrong?
[09:39.610 --> 09:42.170]  Why do you hate everything? No, I don't hate everything.
[09:42.810 --> 09:46.750]  It's a little bit of reach. It's like taking a punter in the first round.
[09:47.190 --> 09:50.870]  Yeah, I don't. It's just not great imagery. Now is it? All right.
[09:50.870 --> 09:55.610]  What is a rock? Does it need to be a- does a rock not a rock also have to be good imagery?
[09:56.010 --> 09:57.430]  No, it's just a little rough to go.
[09:57.850 --> 10:03.510]  We started- we started the draft with rock candy and then progressed into crack rock.
[10:03.990 --> 10:04.510]  Look.
[10:05.470 --> 10:11.850]  Now, so my rock not rock is technically a rock but the slang term for crack is rock. Yes.
[10:12.110 --> 10:15.250]  So mine is technically the term
[10:15.250 --> 10:16.290]  used
[10:16.930 --> 10:22.490]  Uh nickname for for crack. Now. Yeah. Andrew, I will agree with you. I feel like
[10:22.490 --> 10:28.650]  this was like taking a punter in the first pick and then you're then the second pick is a long snap.
[10:30.650 --> 10:34.210]  What's wrong with this? So bizarre. There's so many.
[10:34.590 --> 10:37.010]  The whole thing's bizarre. What do you want from me?
[10:37.150 --> 10:44.070]  Okay, what's bizarre is you said there's a clear number one overall and that's not crack. That's not what you submitted.
[10:44.070 --> 10:46.310]  Yesterday we recorded-
[10:46.310 --> 10:51.390]  Hey Gavin. Well, I said you said I said everyone would pick the rock and everyone was like no, I'm not picking the rock.
[10:51.450 --> 10:52.050]  Why would I do that?
[10:52.550 --> 10:56.330]  Oh, I think you got you got flustered by the lack of- the rock is a great pick.
[10:56.550 --> 11:01.230]  The rock is should be in the first round in my opinion. Well pick the rock then you idiot.
[11:01.910 --> 11:06.850]  I'm not because I think there's a better rock not rock. Okay. Well, it's time for you to uh,
[11:07.250 --> 11:10.930]  put your money where your mouth is because it's your pick. Hey Gavin. Yeah.
[11:11.590 --> 11:15.870]  I think we're entering into Geoff and Gavin versus the rest of this era.
[11:16.530 --> 11:18.990]  You and me buddy. I know. We keep-
[11:18.990 --> 11:26.910]  Eye to eye buddy. You and me. Fuck the rest of these losers. The two guys who had a boring off are gonna be-
[11:28.850 --> 11:29.630]  That's right.
[11:30.770 --> 11:32.630]  I'm taking what I think.
[11:33.150 --> 11:39.390]  One of the most if not the most iconic. It's a classic. Everyone knows it. It's undeniable.
[11:39.910 --> 11:45.290]  The great rock from rock, paper, scissors. The hand rock. The hand rock from rock, paper, scissors.
[11:45.570 --> 11:51.750]  Name a more iconic rock that isn't a rock. That. You can't. That was powerful. I had that slated for second round.
[11:52.050 --> 11:57.750]  It's a go-to move. Wow. That's a pretty good actually. That's a very good one. Everybody knows it. Pretty obvious. Yeah.
[11:57.830 --> 12:02.170]  It's great. Yeah. Well, you know rock candy is on my board too. Eighth round. Eighth round draft grade.
[12:02.190 --> 12:03.910]  I was going for- I was going for deep cuts.
[12:04.450 --> 12:04.950]  But uh, yeah.
[12:05.470 --> 12:08.510]  With the first pick, you're going deep.
[12:09.070 --> 12:12.690]  The first cut. My first pick was my least deep. Trust me.
[12:12.750 --> 12:19.370]  Geoff, could you imagine if the Celtics GM or owner after drafting the player said, yeah, we wanted a deep cut.
[12:19.550 --> 12:24.090]  So we went with somebody no one's heard of. I didn't realize we're building a rock NBA team here.
[12:24.170 --> 12:25.250]  I thought we were just being funny.
[12:26.090 --> 12:30.990]  I'm trying to be interesting and I'm trying to pick things that people wouldn't normally think about as a rock.
[12:30.990 --> 12:35.230]  You've, I mean, you've definitely done that with rock candy at a number one.
[12:35.230 --> 12:36.370]  Hell yeah. Hell yeah.
[12:36.910 --> 12:44.810]  Okay, I'm up next and mine is uh, uh, more of a concept, but it's encompassing and that'll be rock and roll.
[12:44.970 --> 12:45.750]  Oh, okay.
[12:46.010 --> 12:49.450]  Just- Great pick. Again, very, I think it's an obvious pick.
[12:49.630 --> 12:55.350]  I don't think there's anything wrong with an obvious pick in the first round. I think rock and roll as uh,
[12:55.810 --> 12:57.130]  a choice in a
[12:57.130 --> 12:59.510]  rock not rock thing is where
[12:59.510 --> 13:04.270]  knee-jerk, you might go past the rock from professional wrestling.
[13:04.450 --> 13:09.690]  So I feel very good about my first round pick. Was rock and roll a culmination of rock music and roll music?
[13:10.030 --> 13:11.870]  Or did they come together from the start?
[13:12.390 --> 13:17.830]  I've had this thought recently. I don't know what roll is. I've asked this. Can it, is there just roll?
[13:18.450 --> 13:19.790]  Can a song just roll?
[13:20.610 --> 13:23.850]  I have no idea. I haven't got a clear answer. We should look into that. Yeah.
[13:24.410 --> 13:31.210]  Who's next? Is Nick? Nick's pick? Nick, a final first round. I didn't hear Andrew's opinion on uh, rock and roll. Oh, it's good.
[13:31.470 --> 13:34.610]  It's a great pick. You think he's not gonna suck Eric off? Please.
[13:35.570 --> 13:40.950]  Why are you blowing Eric for that? Because he didn't take crack rock in the first round.
[13:41.330 --> 13:46.030]  He made a sensible pick. Everyone knows rock and roll. It's a great pick. Everyone knows crack rock.
[13:46.810 --> 13:51.430]  Oh, man.
[13:51.810 --> 13:58.250]  Okay, so we talked about this in the episode, but I feel like I have to go with it just because it's
[13:58.250 --> 14:00.790]  one of the first R-rated movies I saw as a kid.
[14:01.370 --> 14:08.090]  Are you gonna double rock? No, he's gonna double rock, isn't he? Michael Bay movie, great movie. Sean Connery,
[14:08.150 --> 14:11.210]  Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris, and a young John C. McGinley from Scrubs.
[14:11.750 --> 14:16.010]  Also, I don't know if y'all know this, but a popular fan theory is that Sean Connery is a
[14:16.010 --> 14:22.690]  version of James Bond. Watch out, Bond. That's right. Oh, I didn't know that. Is that like a headcanon thing?
[14:22.890 --> 14:29.470]  Yeah, headcanon. Everyone should watch the outtakes of that movie, by the way. Ed Harris goes absolutely apeshit in them.
[14:30.130 --> 14:34.650]  Dude, I sat next to Ed Harris at Chewy's once about 15 years ago.
[14:35.430 --> 14:41.150]  Whoa. Wow. That's pretty cool. Yeah, it was pretty cool. Did you get his opinion on rock candy? I didn't ask him. No. Damn.
[14:41.150 --> 14:48.610]  Uh, how do you feel? So our first round is completed with Geoff selecting rock candy, Gavin selecting crack rock,
[14:49.070 --> 14:54.550]  Andrew, rock from rock, paper, scissors, Eric, rock and roll, and Nick, the rock film.
[14:54.950 --> 14:56.710]  First round in the books.
[14:57.710 --> 15:03.190]  All right. I'm annoyed. I feel like Nick tried to gif like he's like, you know what, Geoff?
[15:03.230 --> 15:05.830]  You're saying you didn't do well last time. I'll give you first.
[15:05.830 --> 15:11.750]  So he put Geoff and Gavin first and they they rewarded that by stepping in cement shoes and jumping into a lake.
[15:11.750 --> 15:21.990]  Like they just have used, they've wasted their positioning and I feel Nick. Your negativity is unwarranted and unappreciated right now.
[15:22.110 --> 15:23.290]  Way off your draft board.
[15:23.510 --> 15:28.830]  And I feel like you, in a weird way, Nick has rewarded himself going last because he has an amazing swing position.
[15:29.150 --> 15:34.530]  I think he might go double rock, which is incredible. And I think there's a good way to find out, Nick,
[15:34.530 --> 15:37.190]  you have the first selection in our second round.
[15:37.770 --> 15:44.370]  What do you choose? Let me pull up a picture. Oh, okay. Oh, I have a coupon on this. Oh, okay.
[15:45.130 --> 15:50.590]  This is good. This is good. I have a coupon. I don't think it's for rock. Going with Rocky Road ice cream. Wow!
[15:50.930 --> 15:54.010]  That's a great ice cream. I am on a tear of ice cream right now.
[15:54.070 --> 15:57.470]  And it's all thanks to when we watch Condor Man. I used to eat those
[15:57.470 --> 16:01.870]  like Halo Top diet ice creams and now i'm just like throwing caution to the wind
[16:01.870 --> 16:04.870]  and i'm buying all the creamy creations that we can get up in here.
[16:05.110 --> 16:11.070]  I had my Condor Man crunch for like the next four evenings to finish that off.
[16:13.530 --> 16:16.750]  Do you watch Condor Man every time? Have you seen Condor Man five times?
[16:19.070 --> 16:23.190]  That's a solid second choice. It's a great picnic. I really like that.
[16:26.190 --> 16:30.850]  There's a lot that I could do here with the second. You have so much. Right, but
[16:31.390 --> 16:33.570]  I'm sort of, I think I'm gonna go
[16:34.610 --> 16:35.150]  against
[16:35.150 --> 16:36.350]  Okay
[16:37.490 --> 16:39.650]  My pick, my second pick
[16:40.150 --> 16:41.310]  is Rock Band 2.
[16:41.470 --> 16:42.790]  Great pick.
[16:43.330 --> 16:44.310]  Rock Band 2
[16:44.690 --> 16:46.230]  I think is
[16:46.590 --> 16:52.790]  the height of the popularity of Rock Band. Has an incredible list of songs.
[16:53.170 --> 16:56.430]  Really fixed the hammer-on pull-off
[16:56.930 --> 17:00.690]  issue that Rock Band 1 had and
[17:00.850 --> 17:07.150]  I just spent hours and hours and hours and hours and hours playing this game with friends. So
[17:07.150 --> 17:15.390]  Rock Band 2, I feel, is a very solid choice for my second round. I miss the era of video games with insane amounts of
[17:15.390 --> 17:21.990]  peripherals. Yes. Having the drum set, the guitar, like it was so much fun to like travel with even though it was a headache to
[17:21.990 --> 17:23.990]  move. It's like buy a room. It is
[17:24.530 --> 17:29.230]  It's a great game. It's a great pick, but fuck, I'm in a tough spot now.
[17:29.230 --> 17:32.210]  Yes, I was really hoping you would go up the rocks. Was that one of your picks?
[17:32.710 --> 17:35.530]  I mean, it was on the board. I had Rock Band on the board.
[17:35.630 --> 17:38.310]  I wasn't sure which one I'd go with, but I think Rock Band 2 is a great choice.
[17:39.090 --> 17:39.870]  I'm really, because
[17:41.010 --> 17:46.550]  I understand your predicament, Andrew. I feel like I was just in it where I went, oh, I know what I want
[17:46.550 --> 17:52.570]  but there's such, you know, the obvious choice and it has, do you work for the block or are you true to yourself?
[17:54.130 --> 17:58.430]  It's more of an issue for me where there's an obvious choice, but the one, yeah
[17:58.430 --> 18:03.910]  I really want something, but I'm not confident it will get back to me. I'm worried about it.
[18:04.350 --> 18:07.350]  But with Rock Candy and Crack Rock, I don't feel like I can predict
[18:07.350 --> 18:11.370]  what's coming next. You won't. You won't predict mine. I guarantee you.
[18:11.690 --> 18:13.250]  Okay. Well, I'm
[18:14.210 --> 18:15.870]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna go with
[18:15.870 --> 18:19.930]  not the obvious one, although it should be taken by this one. I'm stunned
[18:20.510 --> 18:28.410]  that it's not taken. I'm going with an all-time classic. You cannot, you cannot deny the power of John Tesh
[18:28.430 --> 18:32.150]  I'm going b-b-b-b-b-b-basketball. I'm going round ball rock.
[18:32.590 --> 18:34.390]  Oh, that's such a good one.
[18:35.010 --> 18:37.970]  The old NBC's on basketball theme. It's fantastic.
[18:38.350 --> 18:43.190]  A great SNL sketch that I'd highly recommend watching. Yep. Fantastic song.
[18:43.490 --> 18:48.950]  It's ridiculous. I'd watch his version of it for the the photo I linked. It's hilarious. It's just so absurd.
[18:49.470 --> 18:54.550]  Great music gets pumped. One of the best support songs of all time, I'd say. As far as like TV networks go.
[18:54.990 --> 18:58.330]  Um, I think that that's a, I think it's a really good choice.
[18:58.430 --> 19:01.930]  I think that it's a lot of fun. I will now,
[19:02.710 --> 19:07.310]  where we're at in the draft, I will take back everything that I said about Rock Candy and Crack Rock.
[19:07.550 --> 19:12.030]  Thank you. Because now this is swinging back to Gavin and Geoff and they have
[19:12.590 --> 19:18.970]  essentially the world wide open, uh, for whatever they want because there's no way they were picking any of those six,
[19:19.030 --> 19:25.170]  I think, other than maybe the Rock film. So I take it all back. Good picks on Rock Candy and Crack Rock.
[19:25.170 --> 19:31.070]  Well, no, I, I still think those are, wait, I'm not, nobody's taken Rock Candy first round or second round.
[19:31.090 --> 19:35.490]  Uh, I just did. It's the number one pick in the draft. But Andrew, it's wide open.
[19:36.150 --> 19:41.590]  It's, no, I understand. But I guess my concern, you guys just watched a basketball game
[19:41.590 --> 19:45.770]  that maybe put me a little paranoid on edge that Roundball Rock was gonna get taken.
[19:46.090 --> 19:51.490]  I just really wanted, I really wanted John Tesh on my board. Okay, who's next? Gavin? I'm next. Um,
[19:52.150 --> 19:53.730]  my pick, Geoff will know what this is,
[19:54.290 --> 19:57.810]  uh, Bad Guy Daddy 3. Oh, Bad Guy Daddy 3!
[19:58.210 --> 20:00.370]  What? 30 Rocks. Yeah.
[20:01.450 --> 20:04.030]  That's a great choice. That is a great choice.
[20:04.690 --> 20:12.630]  When Millie was younger, she went through a phase where she always wanted to watch Liar Liar and she called it Bad Guy Daddy.
[20:13.310 --> 20:14.170]  And then, um,
[20:14.290 --> 20:18.190]  I think we got sick of watching it. So we wanted to watch all of The Office.
[20:18.590 --> 20:23.070]  So to, um, make sure that Millie was fine with it, we named The Office Bad Guy Daddy 2.
[20:23.870 --> 20:29.010]  And then, and then when we were done watching The Office, we moved on to Bad Guy Daddy 3.
[20:29.810 --> 20:31.630]  Which was all of 30 Rock.
[20:32.610 --> 20:37.190]  And she fucking fell for it because she was a little kid, but she's just like, where's Bad Guy Daddy?
[20:37.430 --> 20:38.470]  When is he gonna show up?
[20:38.690 --> 20:46.250]  So I think Michael Scott was technically the second Bad Guy Daddy and then, uh, Alec Baldwin was the third. Yeah.
[20:46.930 --> 20:53.350]  Oh, man. I forgot about that. I think that's a great choice. That's a, that's definitely like a first round.
[20:53.730 --> 20:59.070]  Pick. That's a good one. Good. Great. Great. Great. Wasn't even on my board. That's a great pick. Fantastic.
[20:59.470 --> 21:05.010]  Uh, prepare to hate my next pick. Uh, okay. I'm gonna share my screen. You're gonna share your screen?
[21:06.150 --> 21:08.070]  The next pick for me,
[21:08.470 --> 21:15.570]  number two is Rocky from The Rockford Files. Jim Rockford's dad on The Rockford Files was named Rocky.
[21:15.990 --> 21:20.810]  It's also my dad's favorite show. And when I would come home from the army to spend time with my dad,
[21:20.810 --> 21:23.570]  we would watch Rockford Files together. It was how we bonded.
[21:23.670 --> 21:27.470]  So if you make fun of this, you're making fun of my dead father. And that's really sad.
[21:27.950 --> 21:32.850]  Five facts about The Rockford Files. Rocky. The character was played by Noah Beery Jr.
[21:33.490 --> 21:36.870]  Rocky was a retired truck driver in the show. Number three,
[21:37.150 --> 21:43.310]  he was listed as number 45 on TV Guide's list of best TV dads of all time. Number four,
[21:43.570 --> 21:49.810]  he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame way back in 1960, way before The Rockford Files even aired. And number five,
[21:49.810 --> 21:53.890]  he died in 1994 of cerebral thrombosis. Oh my god.
[21:56.890 --> 21:58.570]  Rocky from The Rockford Files.
[21:59.190 --> 22:04.290]  The exclamation mark at the end of each fact is it hits really hard with a death one. He did.
[22:05.070 --> 22:06.250]  Yeah, as rough.
[22:06.970 --> 22:12.510]  Geoff, I appreciate the pick. I think that's a wonderful story you shared. I'm not going to say anything negative about it.
[22:12.570 --> 22:15.990]  I love that you made the slides. I want that to be clear. I'm a big fan of the slides.
[22:16.050 --> 22:18.430]  I think you've done a fantastic job in that regard.
[22:18.430 --> 22:24.290]  These may not be the rocks that the world would pick, but these are the rocks that mean something to me in my life.
[22:24.690 --> 22:26.070]  Yeah, I respect it.
[22:26.670 --> 22:31.490]  I mean, that's weird for a... like, that's cool and I get that. It's weird for a draft that we're all doing.
[22:32.010 --> 22:35.190]  Yeah, you gotta... like, team chemistry is one of the most important things.
[22:35.750 --> 22:40.050]  Like, and so I gotta build a team that I feel comfortable with being a part of.
[22:40.390 --> 22:45.790]  Didn't you say earlier, like, oh, are we drafting a... we're not drafting a perfect basketball team. Isn't that the thing you said?
[22:46.250 --> 22:49.370]  I'm not saying it's a perfect basketball team. I'm saying it's a team that has good chemistry.
[22:49.990 --> 22:52.910]  A team that... I'm building unity. Yeah, that's a good one, too.
[22:53.290 --> 22:58.410]  Because his entry has Rocky from the Rockford Files, which is two references of the word rock in the same room.
[22:58.530 --> 23:00.590]  It's the first level rock from Rock, Paper, Scissors.
[23:01.090 --> 23:06.330]  Kind of doubling it. And I will say, Geoff, you probably should have kept sharing your screen because you are up next.
[23:06.830 --> 23:12.230]  Oh, okay. I am up next. Well, here we go. Let me switch back over and share my screen again.
[23:12.650 --> 23:12.990]  Okay.
[23:13.580 --> 23:16.730]  He might... I never even considered the possibility of a double Rocky.
[23:17.170 --> 23:20.970]  Yeah. All right. So I'm gonna move on. My third rock
[23:21.550 --> 23:28.190]  in the Rock Not Rock draft is the Moonrockers. They really rock. I don't know if you guys remember the Moonrockers.
[23:28.410 --> 23:30.610]  They were the replacement band
[23:31.150 --> 23:34.490]  for the Rockafire Explosion at Showbiz Pizza.
[23:35.290 --> 23:37.330]  Here's five facts about the Moonrockers.
[23:37.730 --> 23:41.670]  They were a retrofitted version of the Rockafire Explosion.
[23:41.670 --> 23:48.130]  The members of the band, a second fact, were Princess Hayley, Quasar, Admiral Ork, Ozone, Mulgama, and Sismis.
[23:48.550 --> 23:54.650]  And number three, it was possible to change the Rockafire characters into the Moonrockers in just 20 minutes.
[23:55.050 --> 23:59.850]  Number four, they were available as an add-on to the Rockafire Explosion for just $15,000,
[24:00.190 --> 24:04.150]  which is a bargain if you think about it, because the Rockafire Explosion was like 75 grand.
[24:04.310 --> 24:08.970]  So then you get like a basically a second band for only 15,000 more. And fact number five,
[24:09.230 --> 24:11.090]  there's not many facts about them online.
[24:13.490 --> 24:14.830]  I've never heard of them.
[24:15.150 --> 24:22.570]  I miss the idea of novelty restaurants with gimmicky shit in them. Like I want more Rainforest Cafes. Yeah, I want more animatronics.
[24:23.130 --> 24:26.850]  That's ridiculous. They were at the tail end of the height of animatronics.
[24:27.510 --> 24:32.610]  Really? Yeah. That's interesting. I've never been to like a Showbiz Pizza or like any anything like that.
[24:32.830 --> 24:36.950]  I would have loved to have experienced that. And I have no that and and you're not gonna upset.
[24:37.070 --> 24:40.050]  My dad didn't take me to the Showbiz Pizzeria or anything. He didn't? Okay.
[24:40.050 --> 24:43.350]  No, like it wasn't like the last thing he did before he died or anything. So feel free to shit on my right.
[24:43.470 --> 24:46.690]  My third one. No, I you know what? You've been clear. You're team heart.
[24:47.410 --> 24:52.050]  You're going with your heart. I'm not gonna attack you. I've seen the Moonrockers in my childhood.
[24:52.310 --> 24:56.630]  I remember them very clearly because they were fucking weird and they were all aliens and I was like, I want the bear back.
[24:56.850 --> 24:57.210]  You know.
[24:57.870 --> 24:59.490]  I miss the Rockafire Explosion.
[25:00.050 --> 25:01.370]  I know you've structured this way.
[25:01.430 --> 25:06.690]  Would you say that you like rock candy more than that memory of your father and Rocky and Rockford Files?
[25:06.690 --> 25:12.410]  Is that have more weight to you? No, I I said I said I was picking rock candy first just because I
[25:12.850 --> 25:15.990]  I thought I had the biggest chance of getting picked by somebody else.
[25:16.250 --> 25:21.770]  I had zero fear that you guys had ever even heard of the Moonrockers or Rocky.
[25:22.690 --> 25:24.530]  Okay, fair enough.
[25:24.610 --> 25:26.750]  Gavin. Okay, my third pick.
[25:27.630 --> 25:27.990]  Bam.
[25:29.150 --> 25:31.470]  Oh, Rock Lobster. A Rock Lobster.
[25:33.150 --> 25:34.930]  It's a good one. It's no it's not.
[25:36.690 --> 25:39.650]  It's a song. It's a song. It's a twofer.
[25:40.350 --> 25:46.630]  Wow, you got the B-52s and seafood restaurant. There you go. This is unbelievable. What do you mean?
[25:46.990 --> 25:49.970]  Well, I think it's a great pick. No, it's not. It's the problem.
[25:50.210 --> 25:56.230]  Once again, the problem is he said that there's another pick that is obviously the first overall that's taken and he's now taken three
[25:56.230 --> 26:01.570]  things ahead of it. That's what's baffling to me. I don't know how this works. I don't know what I should be doing.
[26:03.190 --> 26:09.370]  Gavin, I think you made a great pick. You're doing fantastic. What you should be doing is not listening to Andrew because he doesn't make a lot of sense.
[26:10.510 --> 26:11.830]  He's all over the map.
[26:12.030 --> 26:14.210]  I think I'm being very clear on this.
[26:14.690 --> 26:19.490]  I'm honestly, I'm throwing these in and I'm like squinting my eyes shut because I don't know what's going to happen.
[26:19.710 --> 26:20.790]  You shout on crack rocks.
[26:21.250 --> 26:25.990]  I got a good job for 30 Rock. I got a shout on shout for Rock Lobster.
[26:26.070 --> 26:28.470]  I don't know what's going to happen whenever I put one in.
[26:28.470 --> 26:35.020]  I feel like I'm a fucking deal or no deal.
[26:35.340 --> 26:37.520]  Are you still a 7 out of 10 on this?
[26:39.780 --> 26:41.340]  Yeah, where are you at right now?
[26:43.660 --> 26:46.540]  I'm feeling pretty good after 30. Right now I'm at a 4 again.
[26:46.980 --> 26:50.160]  Why? I think everyone else said it's good. Rock Lobster is good.
[26:50.380 --> 26:51.560]  I love it.
[26:51.820 --> 26:53.800]  But it's Andrew's bit and he's shitting on it.
[26:53.980 --> 26:57.560]  No, I'm just saying, I think contextually there's other things to take.
[26:58.060 --> 27:00.020]  What do you mean there's other things to take?
[27:00.260 --> 27:01.260]  Do you want me to just take it? Do I have to take it?
[27:01.260 --> 27:03.660]  I didn't want to do this. I didn't plan on doing this.
[27:03.740 --> 27:05.840]  But I can't believe I'm still getting...
[27:05.840 --> 27:07.640]  I'm going with Dwayne the Rock Johnson.
[27:08.040 --> 27:09.360]  The all time.
[27:10.400 --> 27:11.640]  One of the biggest movie stars.
[27:11.700 --> 27:13.020]  If not the biggest movie star in the world.
[27:13.740 --> 27:16.220]  So many great movies. Fast Five. The Rundown.
[27:16.700 --> 27:17.660]  Just an all around talent.
[27:17.960 --> 27:19.840]  That's not even talking about his wrestling career.
[27:20.680 --> 27:21.080]  Unbelievable.
[27:21.740 --> 27:23.560]  The biggest Rock that isn't a Rock.
[27:24.140 --> 27:24.900]  Possibly in the world.
[27:25.700 --> 27:27.580]  At least financially, I think that's undeniable.
[27:27.980 --> 27:29.020]  Yeah, he was my cover sheet.
[27:30.140 --> 27:32.660]  He main evented four Wrestlemanias.
[27:33.040 --> 27:34.100]  He's a...
[27:34.100 --> 27:34.800]  I mean really.
[27:35.040 --> 27:36.120]  He's the man.
[27:36.520 --> 27:38.040]  Definitely on the list.
[27:38.980 --> 27:42.140]  I'd say the only place he's failed is video games.
[27:42.520 --> 27:44.020]  Are you not going to post a picture of the Rock?
[27:44.400 --> 27:46.960]  You covered it already. It was on your spreadsheet.
[27:47.480 --> 27:50.240]  Honestly, I can find one.
[27:50.400 --> 27:52.240]  But I didn't expect to get him in the third one.
[27:53.940 --> 27:56.260]  I'm going to go with my favorite Rock.
[27:56.860 --> 27:57.760]  Era Rock.
[27:57.760 --> 27:59.980]  I'm going to take specifically
[28:00.800 --> 28:02.220]  the Rock from
[28:02.220 --> 28:03.060]  The Rundown.
[28:03.700 --> 28:05.480]  Nah, a little past that.
[28:06.200 --> 28:07.220]  A little after that.
[28:07.800 --> 28:09.340]  Slight adjustment. Rock from The Rundown.
[28:10.020 --> 28:11.260]  My favorite Rock movie.
[28:11.660 --> 28:12.580]  I haven't seen that.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.240]  It's a good movie.
[28:15.780 --> 28:16.400]  Good action movie.
[28:17.920 --> 28:18.800]  I'm next.
[28:20.020 --> 28:21.680]  I'm going to take a pick
[28:21.680 --> 28:23.260]  that I don't know that
[28:23.920 --> 28:26.180]  everyone's going to agree with, but I'm going to go for it.
[28:26.180 --> 28:28.280]  I'm going to go with
[28:28.980 --> 28:30.300]  Ad Rock from
[28:30.300 --> 28:31.080]  The Beastie Boys.
[28:31.460 --> 28:34.500]  That's a great one.
[28:35.260 --> 28:35.840]  Really good.
[28:36.100 --> 28:37.640]  Really fantastic lyrics.
[28:38.060 --> 28:40.620]  My name is Ad Rock. I'm a Scorpio.
[28:40.860 --> 28:42.720]  Don't ask me because I just don't know.
[28:43.280 --> 28:44.480]  Famously married to
[28:44.480 --> 28:45.640]  Ione Skye.
[28:46.220 --> 28:47.640]  Now he's married to
[28:48.400 --> 28:50.460]  the lady from Bikini Kill.
[28:51.340 --> 28:52.500]  Yes, that is true.
[28:52.800 --> 28:53.640]  I think they're married.
[28:53.640 --> 28:55.020]  The screaming woman?
[28:55.640 --> 28:56.960]  Yeah, on my phone.
[28:57.180 --> 29:00.060]  My phone ringer, the screaming lady, that's who's married to him.
[29:01.340 --> 29:02.600]  That's a great point, Gavin.
[29:02.820 --> 29:04.360]  That's such a good pick, Eric.
[29:04.500 --> 29:06.160]  I can't believe I missed him.
[29:06.380 --> 29:07.860]  I feel really good about Ad Rock.
[29:08.040 --> 29:09.980]  Ad Rock, truly the king.
[29:11.080 --> 29:11.960]  Really big fan.
[29:12.420 --> 29:14.020]  So, happy with The Beastie Boys
[29:14.020 --> 29:14.840]  pick on this thing.
[29:15.380 --> 29:18.420]  I love The Beastie Boys. I can't believe I never even considered Ad Rock.
[29:18.480 --> 29:19.680]  Wow, it wasn't even on your list?
[29:19.980 --> 29:21.220]  It wasn't even on my list.
[29:21.220 --> 29:22.900]  Missed my board completely.
[29:23.040 --> 29:25.420]  And I love Ad Rock.
[29:25.660 --> 29:26.940]  My favorite Beastie Boy.
[29:27.020 --> 29:28.280]  God damn it, I'm mad at myself.
[29:28.700 --> 29:30.300]  Kathleen Hannah, that's her name.
[29:31.500 --> 29:32.760]  Great choice, great choice.
[29:33.460 --> 29:33.840]  Nick?
[29:34.080 --> 29:37.500]  I feel like you have put a lot of pressure on with that one.
[29:37.900 --> 29:39.300]  And so I have
[29:40.040 --> 29:41.140]  reconsidered my third pick.
[29:41.220 --> 29:43.720]  I know what my fourth one's gonna be, so I think I'm gonna drop
[29:43.720 --> 29:45.560]  what I originally had, and I'm gonna pivot to
[29:45.560 --> 29:46.900]  something. I don't know if anyone
[29:47.720 --> 29:49.060]  remembers this show or not.
[29:49.060 --> 29:51.020]  Third Rock from the Sun.
[29:51.100 --> 29:52.660]  Oh, that's a good one.
[29:52.800 --> 29:53.960]  We got John Lithgow.
[29:54.260 --> 29:57.080]  You got a bunch of young...
[29:57.080 --> 29:58.480]  What the hell's his name? I can't remember.
[29:58.620 --> 29:59.780]  Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
[30:00.780 --> 30:02.180]  Yeah, Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
[30:03.440 --> 30:05.380]  Also, Wayne Knight from Seinfeld.
[30:07.980 --> 30:09.000]  Great show.
[30:09.380 --> 30:10.760]  Completely forgot about it.
[30:10.960 --> 30:13.800]  And I think it might be worth a rewatch.
[30:14.440 --> 30:15.980]  I think John Lithgow's a great actor.
[30:16.180 --> 30:17.920]  Joseph Gordon-Levitt, obviously, is a great actor.
[30:17.920 --> 30:19.760]  I think you drafted this appropriately
[30:19.760 --> 30:22.040]  with the third round pick of Third Rock from the Sun.
[30:22.280 --> 30:24.100]  I think there's a lot to like about this.
[30:24.700 --> 30:25.380]  I think it's a good pick.
[30:25.640 --> 30:27.000]  And I think it's draft appropriate.
[30:27.380 --> 30:30.100]  When you grow up with Lithgow and this, and then you watch him in Dexter
[30:30.100 --> 30:32.240]  and you're like, oh...
[30:33.640 --> 30:34.700]  Quit the rage!
[30:36.440 --> 30:37.160]  Great pick.
[30:37.980 --> 30:40.240]  Last pick. So this one I was gonna
[30:40.240 --> 30:42.080]  go with no matter what, I think. Unless somebody had
[30:42.080 --> 30:44.360]  picked it first. Might be a little controversial,
[30:44.580 --> 30:45.960]  but I'm gonna go with
[30:45.960 --> 30:47.300]  Rolling Rock Beer.
[30:48.600 --> 30:51.840]  No matter what, it's always skunky.
[30:52.040 --> 30:53.880]  If you love that taste for some reason.
[30:54.120 --> 30:56.340]  But it's the beer I feel like your dad always has
[30:56.340 --> 30:57.880]  in his fridge when you go home to visit.
[30:58.200 --> 31:00.260]  And it's usually the thing that you probably have
[31:00.260 --> 31:01.620]  for the first time with your dad.
[31:02.140 --> 31:04.360]  So it's one of the first things I ever had
[31:04.360 --> 31:05.760]  when I was old enough to drink a beer
[31:05.760 --> 31:07.060]  like that I had with my dad.
[31:07.460 --> 31:09.720]  I've only heard of that because of Angry Video Game Nerd.
[31:10.200 --> 31:11.000]  Oh yeah, him too.
[31:12.720 --> 31:13.980]  After that I went on a kick.
[31:13.980 --> 31:15.860]  It was popular in the army
[31:15.860 --> 31:17.040]  because it's real cheap.
[31:17.300 --> 31:18.400]  It's super cheap, dude.
[31:18.580 --> 31:20.260]  We used to drink it a lot in the army.
[31:21.260 --> 31:22.520]  That's a great fourth pick.
[31:22.700 --> 31:25.720]  Way to go. Nick, your list is complete.
[31:25.960 --> 31:27.140]  It's a really good one.
[31:27.200 --> 31:28.220]  I think you did a really good job.
[31:29.680 --> 31:30.460]  I'm torn.
[31:31.280 --> 31:33.480]  I'm torn for my last pick.
[31:34.820 --> 31:36.420]  I have a theme going
[31:36.920 --> 31:38.260]  and I think I'm gonna stick
[31:38.260 --> 31:40.060]  with it. I guess we'll talk about
[31:40.060 --> 31:41.620]  all of our runners up later
[31:41.620 --> 31:43.680]  when we're done because I think we're gonna have a lot
[31:43.680 --> 31:44.560]  that didn't make the board.
[31:45.060 --> 31:46.840]  So I'm just gonna go with my pick now.
[31:47.560 --> 31:49.520]  And this fits within my theme
[31:49.520 --> 31:51.340]  of all music
[31:51.740 --> 31:53.920]  which is what I was not
[31:53.920 --> 31:56.000]  trying for but definitely ended up with.
[31:56.360 --> 31:57.640]  My final pick
[31:57.640 --> 31:59.260]  is Chris Rock
[31:59.260 --> 32:02.360]  who has
[32:02.360 --> 32:03.640]  a song
[32:03.640 --> 32:04.700]  that
[32:05.840 --> 32:07.580]  he's known for to be a comedian.
[32:08.020 --> 32:08.360]  However,
[32:09.320 --> 32:10.240]  Table Dance?
[32:10.500 --> 32:12.940]  Great song. And that is why I
[32:12.940 --> 32:14.980]  picked Chris Rock. That's why he's in my fourth slot.
[32:15.280 --> 32:16.860]  Table Dance. Way to go
[32:16.860 --> 32:18.720]  Chris Rock. Everything you're
[32:18.720 --> 32:20.680]  doing. Keep it up, man. You're on top
[32:20.680 --> 32:22.700]  of the world right now and I can't
[32:22.700 --> 32:24.120]  wait to see what's next for Chris Rock.
[32:25.040 --> 32:25.820]  It's a good pick.
[32:26.340 --> 32:27.880]  He played CB4.
[32:28.600 --> 32:29.560]  It's classic.
[32:31.240 --> 32:32.560]  Swept from the balls.
[32:35.880 --> 32:36.860]  I do appreciate
[32:36.860 --> 32:38.280]  you went all musical rocks.
[32:38.300 --> 32:40.700]  I think that's a great theme.
[32:41.160 --> 32:43.140]  I was really torn between my
[32:43.140 --> 32:45.280]  next pick and Chris Rock so you made that a lot easier
[32:45.280 --> 32:47.260]  for me. I appreciate that. Great pick,
[32:47.400 --> 32:49.120]  Eric. Really strong board overall
[32:49.120 --> 32:51.180]  as well and in ways that a lot
[32:51.180 --> 32:52.400]  of things I didn't even consider.
[32:53.160 --> 32:55.300]  Great picks. And now it's your turn.
[32:55.500 --> 32:56.600]  Yeah, to round up my draft,
[32:57.160 --> 32:59.340]  I am going to take a film.
[32:59.720 --> 33:01.060]  I'll just quickly prepare a photo
[33:01.060 --> 33:03.400]  for it. It was written by
[33:03.400 --> 33:05.320]  Mike White, survivor
[33:05.320 --> 33:06.920]  player, also creator of the White Lotus,
[33:07.520 --> 33:09.280]  starring Jack Black.
[33:09.640 --> 33:11.740]  I am going to be taking School of Rock.
[33:11.840 --> 33:13.800]  One of my favorite movies
[33:13.800 --> 33:14.680]  growing up.
[33:15.360 --> 33:17.580]  Directed by Austin's own Richard Linklater.
[33:17.900 --> 33:19.200]  It's the Linklater thing.
[33:19.580 --> 33:21.820]  It's great. I had the album as a kid
[33:21.820 --> 33:23.040]  and it was fantastic.
[33:23.300 --> 33:25.600]  A big part of my childhood. Loved School of Rock.
[33:26.140 --> 33:27.340]  It's a great rock-not-rock.
[33:27.920 --> 33:29.600]  Good choice. And that's my pick.
[33:30.220 --> 33:31.500]  Solid choice. Who's next?
[33:31.940 --> 33:32.240]  Gavin!
[33:32.240 --> 33:34.160]  Where's my picture?
[33:36.100 --> 33:37.740]  Here we go.
[33:38.080 --> 33:40.640]  This one is not necessarily
[33:40.640 --> 33:42.420]  a crowd pleaser, but a room pleaser.
[33:43.220 --> 33:43.960]  Bam!
[33:44.560 --> 33:45.020]  K-Rock.
[33:47.100 --> 33:47.840]  Gavin!
[33:49.140 --> 33:51.260]  What a pick!
[33:51.540 --> 33:52.200]  Gavin!
[33:52.920 --> 33:54.840]  That might be the best pick.
[33:55.220 --> 33:56.380]  Oh, wow.
[33:56.540 --> 33:56.900]  Wow.
[33:58.240 --> 33:59.360]  Bit Howard Stern.
[34:00.320 --> 34:01.200]  Oh, Gavin.
[34:01.520 --> 34:02.480]  That's a killer.
[34:03.000 --> 34:04.700]  Oh my god.
[34:05.200 --> 34:07.780]  Honestly, I still had no idea if I was going to be shit on for that.
[34:07.960 --> 34:08.560]  I don't know.
[34:08.860 --> 34:10.980]  No, that's phenomenal. Embarrassed.
[34:11.000 --> 34:11.660]  We're in the fourth round.
[34:13.420 --> 34:14.640]  Great, great pick.
[34:14.780 --> 34:18.100]  I can't believe you snuck that one in. That's a great one, man.
[34:18.460 --> 34:19.720]  Sweet. I'm so relieved.
[34:20.140 --> 34:21.180]  Share my screen.
[34:21.420 --> 34:23.460]  You ended strong on that one.
[34:23.460 --> 34:23.820]  Way to go, man.
[34:24.160 --> 34:26.140]  Good one to end on.
[34:27.320 --> 34:28.440]  All right!
[34:28.820 --> 34:30.320]  I guess I'm going to close
[34:30.320 --> 34:32.840]  the Rock Draft out with my fourth pick.
[34:32.940 --> 34:34.380]  It's the final pick in the draft.
[34:34.720 --> 34:36.600]  I'm amazed. I'm happy nobody
[34:36.600 --> 34:38.380]  picked it before I did, but I didn't
[34:38.380 --> 34:39.500]  really expect you to.
[34:39.940 --> 34:42.580]  The pick I'm going to end this with
[34:42.580 --> 34:45.380]  is 30 North Rockingham Avenue.
[34:45.980 --> 34:47.220]  Does anybody know
[34:47.220 --> 34:49.400]  what 30 North Rockingham Avenue is?
[34:49.400 --> 34:50.580]  It's got a dark history.
[34:51.500 --> 34:52.820]  Wait, 30 or 360?
[34:53.320 --> 34:54.400]  I'm sorry, 360 North.
[34:54.400 --> 34:56.100]  360 North Rockingham Avenue.
[34:57.400 --> 34:58.980]  360 North Rockingham Avenue
[34:58.980 --> 35:00.900]  is famous, one of the most famous
[35:00.900 --> 35:02.760]  addresses in America. Famous
[35:02.760 --> 35:04.800]  because it's where OJ Simpson lived.
[35:05.380 --> 35:06.660]  Here are five facts
[35:06.660 --> 35:08.200]  about 360 North Rockingham.
[35:08.700 --> 35:10.820]  Number one, it no longer exists.
[35:10.980 --> 35:12.660]  It was sold and then razed
[35:12.660 --> 35:14.840]  to the ground in 1998 and a new house
[35:14.840 --> 35:16.440]  was built on it. Number two,
[35:16.580 --> 35:18.960]  Kato Kaelin lived in the guest house. Famous Kato Kaelin.
[35:19.020 --> 35:20.840]  Number three, it is only about
[35:20.840 --> 35:22.780]  two miles from the house where Nicole Simpson
[35:22.780 --> 35:24.600]  and Ron Goldman were brutally
[35:24.600 --> 35:26.480]  murdered. Number four,
[35:26.840 --> 35:28.520]  OJ bought the house in 1907 for only
[35:28.520 --> 35:30.860]  $650,000. And number five,
[35:30.940 --> 35:32.520]  OJ is guilty as shit.
[35:32.640 --> 35:33.040]  Allegedly.
[35:35.680 --> 35:36.480]  There you go.
[35:37.200 --> 35:38.360]  That's my final pick of the
[35:38.360 --> 35:39.740]  360 North Rockingham.
[35:41.180 --> 35:42.880]  You know, when Gavin took
[35:42.880 --> 35:44.880]  Crack Rock, I thought he was going to draft the only
[35:44.880 --> 35:46.800]  killer. I didn't expect there to be
[35:46.800 --> 35:47.860]  a murder house involved.
[35:48.220 --> 35:50.900]  Well, to be fair, nobody was murdered
[35:50.900 --> 35:52.780]  in that house. That's just where
[35:52.780 --> 35:54.180]  OJ lived.
[35:54.720 --> 35:56.860]  When he murdered his wife and
[35:56.860 --> 35:58.920]  her platonic friend
[35:58.920 --> 36:00.660]  by the way. I don't think there was anything going on.
[36:02.280 --> 36:02.980]  This might
[36:02.980 --> 36:04.860]  be the most bonkers piece of content we've
[36:04.860 --> 36:05.240]  made yet.
[36:06.980 --> 36:08.900]  Now, it's not alleged he lived
[36:08.900 --> 36:09.980]  there, right? We can't confirm.
[36:10.080 --> 36:12.040]  He's confirmed to have lived there.
[36:12.500 --> 36:15.040]  He definitely lived there. They had to bulldoze
[36:15.040 --> 36:16.480]  the house because so many people
[36:16.480 --> 36:18.960]  would come by to take photos. It was creating
[36:18.960 --> 36:20.840]  tons of traffic and issues they
[36:20.840 --> 36:23.020]  couldn't resolve. And so eventually they just had to bulldoze
[36:23.020 --> 36:24.940]  the house. And then when they built the new house, they
[36:24.940 --> 36:27.000]  turned it so the address is no
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.160]  longer... there's no longer a 360 North Rockingham.
[36:29.260 --> 36:30.580]  The address changed. Wow.
[36:31.080 --> 36:31.920]  That's crazy.
[36:32.600 --> 36:34.680]  Well, interesting picks. Let's
[36:35.460 --> 36:36.400]  run through
[36:36.960 --> 36:38.900]  this draft board one last time and then
[36:38.900 --> 36:40.780]  maybe talk about some runners up, some things that we
[36:40.780 --> 36:41.880]  didn't get on here.
[36:42.640 --> 36:44.700]  First up, Geoff's drafts are
[36:44.700 --> 36:46.880]  Rock Candy, Rocky from
[36:46.880 --> 36:49.160]  The Rockford Files, The Moon Rockers
[36:49.160 --> 36:50.740]  and 360 North
[36:51.400 --> 36:52.200]  Rockingham Avenue.
[36:54.600 --> 36:55.420]  I like how they get
[36:55.420 --> 36:56.580]  progressively niche.
[36:58.500 --> 36:58.900]  Geoff
[36:58.900 --> 37:00.940]  told me yesterday as we were
[37:00.940 --> 37:02.880]  going to the game, oh, there's no way
[37:02.880 --> 37:04.760]  you guys are getting any of these. And I
[37:04.760 --> 37:06.960]  just... I think I told him, I'm not
[37:06.960 --> 37:08.480]  really sure if that's what you're looking for
[37:08.940 --> 37:10.140]  in the draft.
[37:11.040 --> 37:12.520]  It's the winning one.
[37:12.820 --> 37:14.940]  It's what I was looking for for sure. You did it.
[37:15.880 --> 37:17.080]  Next up is Gavin
[37:17.080 --> 37:18.920]  who was not sure what this was
[37:18.920 --> 37:19.800]  or how to do it.
[37:22.240 --> 37:23.100]  Crack Rock
[37:23.100 --> 37:24.340]  30 Rock,
[37:24.580 --> 37:26.920]  Rock Lobster and K
[37:26.920 --> 37:28.260]  Rock. Great.
[37:28.920 --> 37:30.900]  I mean, really, it started...
[37:30.900 --> 37:32.560]  I will say maybe a little shaky with Crack Rock.
[37:32.900 --> 37:34.180]  Real solid picks.
[37:34.840 --> 37:35.060]  Yeah.
[37:36.580 --> 37:38.560]  My issue is less...
[37:38.560 --> 37:40.480]  Those are all great Rock Not Rock picks.
[37:40.680 --> 37:42.940]  Where they were taken is mainly my issue.
[37:42.940 --> 37:43.960]  Where they were taken?
[37:44.480 --> 37:47.020]  If you would have taken Crack Rock in the 4th round,
[37:47.160 --> 37:48.280]  I would have supported it fully.
[37:48.520 --> 37:50.900]  Coming out with Crack Rock, it's a little strong.
[37:51.360 --> 37:52.560]  And like, reverse.
[37:52.860 --> 37:54.260]  I still don't agree with that.
[37:54.300 --> 37:56.340]  Next time I'll ask you what order I should do them in.
[37:59.520 --> 38:00.460]  If you're bored,
[38:00.940 --> 38:03.000]  I would have went 30 Rock,
[38:03.440 --> 38:04.940]  Rock Lobster, K Rock,
[38:05.040 --> 38:05.460]  Crack Rock.
[38:05.880 --> 38:06.360]  Why?
[38:07.800 --> 38:10.660]  I feel the value of shifting those.
[38:10.660 --> 38:12.480]  It would just be like...
[38:12.480 --> 38:14.640]  I gotta be honest with you, I think the value
[38:14.640 --> 38:16.740]  of Crack Rock is probably higher
[38:16.740 --> 38:17.980]  than anything else on the board.
[38:18.340 --> 38:19.980]  But nobody's gonna take Crack Rock.
[38:20.220 --> 38:22.840]  That's the problem. Too many people take Crack Rock.
[38:22.960 --> 38:23.920]  That's why it's worth so much.
[38:23.940 --> 38:25.260]  But not in this context.
[38:26.560 --> 38:27.760]  I don't know what you mean.
[38:28.860 --> 38:30.800]  You would take Crack Rock over the Rock
[38:30.800 --> 38:32.800]  or Chris Rock or any of these other things?
[38:32.940 --> 38:35.160]  The residuals on Crack Rock are way higher
[38:35.160 --> 38:37.060]  than the residuals on 30 Rock, I guarantee you.
[38:37.780 --> 38:38.580]  I appreciate
[38:38.580 --> 38:40.420]  that you keep explaining this to Gavin
[38:40.420 --> 38:42.740]  and he keeps saying, I don't know what you mean.
[38:42.900 --> 38:44.460]  And there's no effort to try
[38:44.460 --> 38:45.580]  to help him understand.
[38:45.900 --> 38:47.120]  There's no explanation.
[38:47.340 --> 38:48.740]  I wouldn't have done it.
[38:49.720 --> 38:51.020]  It's a value proposition.
[38:51.720 --> 38:53.040]  The value of what value?
[38:56.600 --> 38:57.820]  I'm trying to think.
[38:58.400 --> 39:01.040]  I don't know what you want from me.
[39:01.420 --> 39:02.340]  It would be like,
[39:02.480 --> 39:04.500]  if we were gonna say, what are the best Xbox
[39:04.500 --> 39:06.400]  360 games? And you went
[39:06.400 --> 39:08.380]  Vampire Survivors first round.
[39:08.580 --> 39:10.220]  Or whatever. Not that game. Vampire Reign.
[39:10.500 --> 39:11.720]  Whatever that shitty Vampire game.
[39:11.820 --> 39:13.020]  We're doing Best Rocks?
[39:13.440 --> 39:16.540]  What do you mean? The best rocks that aren't rocks.
[39:16.660 --> 39:18.580]  Yeah. You wanted to try to present the strongest
[39:18.580 --> 39:19.580]  board to win.
[39:20.220 --> 39:22.060]  The draft. By the best.
[39:22.460 --> 39:24.140]  Now you can, I guess, measure what the best is
[39:24.140 --> 39:26.640]  differently, but I feel like Crack Rock
[39:26.640 --> 39:28.560]  is a tough first one
[39:28.560 --> 39:29.120]  to start with.
[39:29.700 --> 39:31.660]  I mean, I couldn't disagree more.
[39:32.060 --> 39:34.260]  Apparently, Crack Rock is worth like
[39:34.260 --> 39:35.780]  1.3 trillion dollars a year.
[39:36.300 --> 39:37.480]  Yeah, that seems pretty high value.
[39:37.760 --> 39:40.300]  And how much money
[39:40.300 --> 39:42.220]  is made from Rock Paper Scissors?
[39:43.020 --> 39:44.080]  Not a lot.
[39:44.340 --> 39:45.080]  It's a free game.
[39:46.380 --> 39:48.020]  Everyone has it for free.
[39:48.340 --> 39:49.280]  You can't even buy it.
[39:51.520 --> 39:52.500]  It's the lowest
[39:52.500 --> 39:53.520]  value game.
[39:54.620 --> 39:56.320]  It's true. You can give Crack Rock
[39:56.320 --> 39:58.360]  away, but it just brings people back to pay for it.
[39:58.420 --> 40:00.080]  Nobody's like, here's a free game.
[40:00.220 --> 40:02.160]  The first game of Rock Paper Scissors
[40:02.160 --> 40:04.080]  is free. You gotta pay me two bucks for the next one.
[40:04.200 --> 40:06.180]  Unless you start charging for games of
[40:06.180 --> 40:07.000]  Rock Paper Scissors.
[40:08.320 --> 40:10.380]  I may be greatly underestimating
[40:10.380 --> 40:12.080]  the power of Crack Rock, but
[40:12.080 --> 40:13.280]  I just don't.
[40:13.920 --> 40:15.860]  In the first round, I don't know.
[40:16.300 --> 40:17.960]  Nobody's dying for Rock Paper Scissors.
[40:18.220 --> 40:20.340]  Well, speaking of Rock Paper Scissors,
[40:20.940 --> 40:22.160]  here's Andrew's draft board.
[40:22.640 --> 40:24.080]  The Rock from Rock Paper Scissors.
[40:24.540 --> 40:26.160]  Round Ball Rock by John Tesh.
[40:26.480 --> 40:28.740]  Dwayne the Rock Johnson in the third round.
[40:29.140 --> 40:30.560]  And School of Rock
[40:30.560 --> 40:31.660]  to round it out.
[40:32.060 --> 40:34.080]  I feel great about my board. There's some of my own
[40:34.520 --> 40:36.400]  personality. Was your School of Rock
[40:36.400 --> 40:38.560]  the film or the soundtrack or the
[40:38.560 --> 40:39.820]  school in School of Rock?
[40:40.140 --> 40:42.120]  I had this conversation with Gavin yesterday.
[40:42.260 --> 40:44.680]  I was worried that if I drafted School of Rock
[40:44.680 --> 40:46.580]  the movie, could somebody then draft
[40:46.580 --> 40:47.580]  School of Rock the soundtrack?
[40:49.580 --> 40:50.740]  I don't think anybody
[40:50.740 --> 40:52.340]  probably would have thought of that except you.
[40:53.720 --> 40:54.680]  I was just thinking
[40:54.680 --> 40:56.560]  of weird double scenarios.
[40:56.800 --> 40:58.540]  I think maybe you outmaneuvered yourself
[40:58.540 --> 40:59.100]  there, bud.
[41:00.140 --> 41:02.780]  Fine, it didn't come up. I was just curious what would happen.
[41:02.880 --> 41:03.840]  Is that even allowed?
[41:03.940 --> 41:06.300]  I was curious how that would have played out.
[41:06.380 --> 41:08.500]  I didn't have to worry about that. So you talked to
[41:08.500 --> 41:09.840]  Gavin about it?
[41:10.420 --> 41:12.600]  I just mentioned the possibilities
[41:12.600 --> 41:14.560]  of... maybe there were other
[41:14.560 --> 41:16.500]  examples that I wasn't aware of. Right.
[41:16.740 --> 41:18.660]  So you talked to Gavin about it. The guy
[41:18.660 --> 41:20.500]  who came into this saying, I don't know what
[41:20.500 --> 41:21.640]  this is or what we're doing.
[41:22.280 --> 41:23.440]  We're just talking casually.
[41:24.200 --> 41:25.640]  This is something I brought up in conversation.
[41:25.640 --> 41:27.160]  I feel like when Gavin
[41:27.160 --> 41:29.600]  and Andrew talk about rules of anything
[41:29.600 --> 41:31.680]  it just gets more confusing.
[41:32.600 --> 41:33.680]  That is true.
[41:33.940 --> 41:35.680]  Gavin and I together make the worst rules
[41:35.680 --> 41:37.920]  committee. I just don't see how that conversation
[41:37.920 --> 41:39.420]  is different from... is the rock
[41:39.420 --> 41:41.920]  the movie different to the rock
[41:41.920 --> 41:43.420]  the Alcatraz
[41:43.420 --> 41:46.080]  prison or the island.
[41:47.340 --> 41:47.700]  Because they're
[41:47.700 --> 41:49.300]  different. These are the same
[41:49.300 --> 41:51.820]  it's just like pulling a part
[41:51.820 --> 41:53.940]  of the specific narrative
[41:53.940 --> 41:56.180]  of School of Rock in a listenable form.
[41:56.740 --> 41:58.080]  The story of Alcatraz
[41:58.080 --> 41:59.860]  is not the story of the rock
[41:59.860 --> 42:01.840]  the movie starring fucking
[42:01.840 --> 42:03.960]  Sean Connery and Ed Harris.
[42:04.160 --> 42:05.540]  Why's he gotta be fucking Sean Connery?
[42:05.920 --> 42:08.100]  Because he is, okay? I didn't name him that.
[42:08.240 --> 42:09.560]  Geoff, argue with his parents.
[42:09.860 --> 42:11.980]  It's not my fault. I didn't do that.
[42:12.260 --> 42:13.420]  I named the
[42:13.940 --> 42:15.280]  fucking Sean Connery.
[42:17.280 --> 42:18.020]  Next up
[42:18.020 --> 42:19.880]  is my music themed draft
[42:19.880 --> 42:22.000]  list of rock and roll, rock
[42:22.000 --> 42:23.820]  band 2, ad rock
[42:23.820 --> 42:25.760]  from the Beastie Boys, and Chris Rock.
[42:26.260 --> 42:27.920]  I feel good about my theming.
[42:28.260 --> 42:29.940]  I am so mad about the
[42:29.940 --> 42:31.440]  ad rock pick. In like a good way.
[42:31.620 --> 42:33.500]  That was such a great pick.
[42:33.660 --> 42:35.200]  It wasn't even in my consideration.
[42:35.260 --> 42:36.060]  But he did it third.
[42:37.660 --> 42:39.400]  Yeah, which is great.
[42:40.140 --> 42:41.840]  Great move by him. It wasn't even
[42:41.840 --> 42:43.060]  on my radar. It should've been.
[42:43.360 --> 42:45.540]  It made me feel dumb. I don't know if Gavin was being
[42:45.540 --> 42:47.860]  accusatory or trying to like
[42:47.860 --> 42:50.060]  also get in on it.
[42:50.060 --> 42:50.600]  Yeah.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.900]  I'm trying to learn without asking
[42:53.900 --> 42:55.640]  questions and it's making it worse.
[42:55.940 --> 42:57.200]  Gavin, there's nothing to learn.
[42:57.460 --> 42:58.660]  There's no consistency.
[42:59.560 --> 43:02.160]  There's no insight for you to glean from any of this.
[43:02.320 --> 43:02.840]  I promise you.
[43:03.580 --> 43:05.160]  It doesn't make any sense.
[43:10.920 --> 43:12.040]  Finally, Nick,
[43:12.840 --> 43:14.020]  who went last,
[43:14.620 --> 43:15.740]  he has chosen
[43:15.740 --> 43:17.920]  The Rock, the film, Rocky
[43:17.920 --> 43:19.960]  Road Ice Cream, Third Rock from the
[43:19.960 --> 43:21.900]  Sun, and Rolling Rock Beer.
[43:22.160 --> 43:23.900]  I think those are all very
[43:23.900 --> 43:24.600]  good choices.
[43:25.420 --> 43:27.940]  All different things. You went for a theme
[43:27.940 --> 43:29.780]  I was trying to pick a different
[43:29.780 --> 43:31.980]  genre. You got a good variety
[43:31.980 --> 43:33.960]  of stuff. Definitely. Rocky Road
[43:33.960 --> 43:35.960]  Ice Cream, great. We can let people
[43:35.960 --> 43:38.080]  vote when this comes out so we can see
[43:38.080 --> 43:40.020]  who they think won. Who do we
[43:40.020 --> 43:40.500]  think won?
[43:41.600 --> 43:44.120]  I mean, I obviously think I won.
[43:45.240 --> 43:46.060]  You do?
[43:46.060 --> 43:48.160]  I think I easily had the
[43:48.160 --> 43:50.100]  best four. Gavin, do you think
[43:50.100 --> 43:52.080]  Geoff won? Sure, I mean
[43:52.080 --> 43:54.220]  I definitely lost, apparently, because I did Crack Rock
[43:54.220 --> 43:56.320]  so I'm not... No, it's
[43:56.960 --> 43:57.580]  it's not a...
[43:57.580 --> 44:00.340]  Sorry, I did Crack Rock first. That's why I lost.
[44:01.080 --> 44:02.080]  It's just confusing
[44:02.080 --> 44:04.360]  when you said literally a day ago you're going to take The Rock
[44:04.360 --> 44:06.040]  first overall. It's a little bit weird.
[44:07.160 --> 44:08.280]  Well... You did. You said
[44:08.840 --> 44:10.240]  undeniably there is a number one
[44:10.240 --> 44:12.200]  overall. I got talked out of doing that
[44:12.200 --> 44:14.160]  because I thought whoever goes first is going to pick The Rock
[44:14.620 --> 44:16.240]  Johnson. Somehow I ended up in the third
[44:16.240 --> 44:18.300]  round. I would say
[44:18.300 --> 44:20.360]  if you looked at our draft board as a teeter-totter
[44:20.360 --> 44:22.460]  Geoff and Gavin's feet are high up in the air.
[44:23.440 --> 44:24.200]  I don't know
[44:24.200 --> 44:25.720]  what you just said. I...
[44:27.460 --> 44:28.200]  Is not being
[44:28.200 --> 44:30.220]  high in the air good or bad? Isn't that what
[44:30.220 --> 44:31.900]  you want from a teeter-totter? To go high?
[44:32.460 --> 44:34.200]  No, I disagree. So I think what you're saying is
[44:34.200 --> 44:36.000]  Gavin and I are closer to the sun
[44:36.000 --> 44:36.880]  and heaven.
[44:38.820 --> 44:40.340]  I need, like, a translator
[44:40.340 --> 44:41.900]  for these. If you equate that to death
[44:41.900 --> 44:43.060]  on the board,
[44:43.160 --> 44:45.140]  maybe it's a Canadian thing.
[44:45.680 --> 44:47.300]  I think I'm being very clear.
[44:48.060 --> 44:49.700]  You know, I'll be honest,
[44:49.820 --> 44:51.620]  the message got a little muddied with Crack Rock,
[44:51.920 --> 44:53.960]  but I think there's
[44:53.960 --> 44:55.940]  a clear... If you did this Family Feud style
[44:55.940 --> 44:57.280]  and you said,
[44:57.820 --> 44:59.780]  name Rock not Rock, Crack Rock
[44:59.780 --> 45:01.700]  is not in the top ten. I don't know
[45:01.700 --> 45:03.880]  if that's true. I don't know that I
[45:03.880 --> 45:05.800]  agree with that at all. Maybe I just have
[45:05.800 --> 45:07.100]  a bias against Crack Rock.
[45:07.580 --> 45:08.980]  I don't know. We'll find out.
[45:08.980 --> 45:11.020]  It's like you spent too much
[45:11.020 --> 45:12.280]  time listening to fucking
[45:13.240 --> 45:13.720]  Dare
[45:15.080 --> 45:16.040]  speeches in
[45:17.220 --> 45:18.860]  gyms across grade schools
[45:18.860 --> 45:20.020]  in Canada, probably.
[45:20.760 --> 45:22.060]  I gave one of those speeches.
[45:22.700 --> 45:24.940]  See, there you go. You're biased against
[45:24.940 --> 45:27.080]  Crack Rock. Yeah, I am.
[45:27.340 --> 45:29.260]  I think you're right. I think I'm in a bubble.
[45:29.560 --> 45:30.960]  I'm in a bubble against Crack.
[45:31.200 --> 45:32.840]  I think we're not gonna see...
[45:32.840 --> 45:34.780]  I don't think we're gonna land on who won.
[45:34.960 --> 45:36.800]  That's fine. Are there any
[45:36.800 --> 45:38.900]  that you didn't pick or that didn't
[45:38.900 --> 45:40.820]  make the draft board that
[45:40.820 --> 45:42.760]  you feel like you want to put out there?
[45:43.340 --> 45:45.020]  I have six, if you don't mind.
[45:45.040 --> 45:45.700]  Please. Of course.
[45:46.300 --> 45:48.700]  These are my backups. Are you gonna share
[45:48.700 --> 45:50.960]  your screen? No, I don't have pictures of them or anything.
[45:50.960 --> 45:52.980]  Oh, okay. Rock the Casbah is great.
[45:53.340 --> 45:54.800]  by The Clash. The old
[45:54.800 --> 45:56.480]  comic book hero, Sergeant Rock.
[45:57.160 --> 45:58.680]  Oh! Rocky and
[45:58.680 --> 46:00.260]  Bullwinkle, who I was a big fan of.
[46:00.320 --> 46:02.800]  That's on my list. The Korean Rock
[46:02.800 --> 46:04.940]  Army. Oh, that's a good one.
[46:06.120 --> 46:07.000]  Pop Rocks.
[46:07.140 --> 46:09.040]  But I liked Rocky Candy
[46:09.040 --> 46:11.220]  more than Pop Rocks. And then Boulder, Colorado.
[46:11.780 --> 46:12.860]  Oh, Boulder, Colorado
[46:12.860 --> 46:15.100]  is a really good one. Yeah, it's where Jean-Benet Ramsey
[46:15.100 --> 46:16.880]  was killed. I was thinking about going just with
[46:16.880 --> 46:18.800]  murders, and then I decided not to.
[46:19.980 --> 46:20.900]  I had the
[46:20.900 --> 46:22.540]  Colorado Rockies on mine.
[46:23.180 --> 46:23.760]  That's a good one.
[46:24.160 --> 46:26.980]  On those rocks? Yeah, that would
[46:26.980 --> 46:28.540]  have been contentious, potentially.
[46:28.860 --> 46:29.700]  Put the baseball team.
[46:31.040 --> 46:31.920]  Oh, okay.
[46:32.520 --> 46:33.260]  Good point.
[46:33.460 --> 46:36.000]  Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, I'm talking
[46:36.000 --> 46:37.800]  about the baseball team, the Colorado
[46:38.280 --> 46:38.760]  Rockies.
[46:40.320 --> 46:41.800]  Specifically the Rocky Mountains
[46:41.800 --> 46:42.340]  in Colorado.
[46:43.860 --> 46:45.940]  Gavin and I are shared together in a
[46:45.940 --> 46:48.080]  non-baseball bubble, like I am in a
[46:48.080 --> 46:49.700]  non-crack bubble. Got it.
[46:51.040 --> 46:51.800]  I had
[46:51.800 --> 46:52.740]  Rockabye Baby.
[46:53.880 --> 46:55.760]  I felt like that one was strong.
[46:56.140 --> 46:57.920]  But the one that I wanted to pick, and then
[46:57.920 --> 46:59.980]  ended up not picking, was my friend
[47:00.560 --> 47:00.920]  Rocco.
[47:02.460 --> 47:04.220]  I just didn't want to get away from him.
[47:04.240 --> 47:06.120]  I felt like my music theming I really enjoyed.
[47:06.560 --> 47:07.420]  That would have been really funny.
[47:07.740 --> 47:10.080]  I wanted to pick my friend Rocco, but
[47:10.620 --> 47:12.080]  then... But would you say he's a
[47:12.080 --> 47:14.060]  rock? See, that's
[47:14.780 --> 47:16.060]  also why I did not pick him.
[47:16.360 --> 47:17.640]  Because, tough.
[47:18.040 --> 47:20.160]  To have to make a case for it is very tough.
[47:21.040 --> 47:21.840]  You know what I mean?
[47:22.700 --> 47:24.000]  Gavin, would you let me or no?
[47:24.380 --> 47:26.240]  I don't know why you're asking me anything about this.
[47:26.500 --> 47:27.800]  I just want to know what you think.
[47:28.680 --> 47:30.300]  I don't know, that's the point.
[47:32.520 --> 47:34.240]  But I want to know what you think.
[47:34.700 --> 47:36.220]  In this moment, what do you think?
[47:36.280 --> 47:37.180]  Would you be okay with it?
[47:37.200 --> 47:39.100]  It's not spelled R-O-C-K.
[47:40.080 --> 47:42.460]  That's true. It's R-O-C-C-O, right?
[47:42.800 --> 47:43.060]  Right.
[47:43.540 --> 47:45.780]  But what about... I had
[47:45.780 --> 47:47.380]  Jay-Z's Rockefeller Records.
[47:47.840 --> 47:49.780]  Would I not be able to have Rockefeller Records?
[47:50.700 --> 47:51.020]  Huh.
[47:51.580 --> 47:54.140]  I don't know. I think I'd allow that.
[47:54.420 --> 47:55.820]  I think I'd be okay with it.
[47:55.820 --> 47:57.360]  I mean, Gavin, you were so adamant
[47:58.140 --> 47:59.940]  just now about it being
[47:59.940 --> 48:01.200]  spelled R-O-C-C-O. I just don't know why
[48:01.200 --> 48:02.600]  you hold the line, bud.
[48:02.820 --> 48:05.860]  I mean, I would have had the same issue with the Korean Army, right?
[48:05.940 --> 48:07.220]  Like, that's R-O-K.
[48:07.440 --> 48:07.900]  R-O-K.
[48:09.300 --> 48:12.840]  Yeah, I don't...
[48:12.840 --> 48:14.340]  I think those picks would get away.
[48:14.620 --> 48:17.500]  I think if Gavin was more confident leading the charge against them,
[48:17.580 --> 48:19.220]  I would be with him.
[48:19.480 --> 48:22.060]  I'd make that charge, but I don't think I'd lead that.
[48:22.460 --> 48:23.880]  I think I'd be okay with all those picks.
[48:23.880 --> 48:25.460]  I'd have been totally fine with it.
[48:25.520 --> 48:27.320]  I had a stick of rock,
[48:27.480 --> 48:29.080]  which I guess is rock candy.
[48:30.140 --> 48:31.680]  No, it's totally different.
[48:32.080 --> 48:32.920]  I don't think you could cheat.
[48:33.560 --> 48:35.600]  Again, Geoff picked rock candy right away.
[48:36.040 --> 48:38.400]  That was gonna be my first pick,
[48:38.780 --> 48:40.360]  and then Geoff picked rock candy
[48:40.360 --> 48:41.900]  and got a shot on, and I was like,
[48:42.020 --> 48:44.580]  thank Christ that I didn't pick that.
[48:44.900 --> 48:45.940]  Wait, hang on.
[48:46.260 --> 48:48.080]  You were gonna pick rock candy
[48:48.080 --> 48:50.100]  also in the first round?
[48:50.820 --> 48:52.460]  That's not such a dumb idea now!
[48:52.460 --> 48:53.480]  I take back
[48:55.260 --> 48:56.800]  everything I said
[48:56.800 --> 48:58.360]  about rock candy as an
[48:58.360 --> 48:59.260]  A number one choice.
[48:59.520 --> 49:02.740]  I absolutely stand corrected.
[49:02.980 --> 49:03.440]  Wow.
[49:04.040 --> 49:06.100]  I didn't know what was happening when he was getting shot,
[49:06.220 --> 49:08.000]  and I just quickly had to find a fourth.
[49:08.840 --> 49:09.800]  Like another one.
[49:10.280 --> 49:11.060]  I was freaking out.
[49:15.820 --> 49:17.420]  I pivoted to crack.
[49:19.440 --> 49:21.020]  From stick of rock.
[49:21.600 --> 49:23.140]  So what I'm hearing is
[49:23.140 --> 49:25.160]  if I didn't pick rock candy first,
[49:25.240 --> 49:26.600]  I would have lost my choice.
[49:26.700 --> 49:27.300]  You would have!
[49:28.860 --> 49:30.620]  Prudent to pick rock candy!
[49:31.040 --> 49:32.480]  Number one in the goddamn draft!
[49:32.740 --> 49:35.000]  It's the LeBron James of rocks, baby!
[49:35.300 --> 49:36.580]  It's Victor Wiminyama!
[49:37.300 --> 49:38.280]  Oh, it's awesome!
[49:38.680 --> 49:41.200]  I mean, Geoff, you picked
[49:41.200 --> 49:42.840]  rock candy and fucked up
[49:42.840 --> 49:43.860]  Gavin's whole board.
[49:44.140 --> 49:46.720]  I posted this picture as well
[49:46.720 --> 49:48.520]  in the episode when we were discussing
[49:48.980 --> 49:50.060]  this whole idea.
[49:50.520 --> 49:52.420]  And then I didn't even get to use it.
[49:53.820 --> 49:55.000]  I feel so fucking vindicated.
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.500]  Well, I mean, you brought up drafting the rock
[49:56.500 --> 49:58.660]  and you didn't pick him either. I will say in an argument,
[49:58.800 --> 50:00.120]  even though you did fuck up his board,
[50:00.360 --> 50:02.480]  it is tough, Geoff, when the guy that is constantly
[50:02.480 --> 50:04.120]  saying, I don't know what's going on,
[50:04.160 --> 50:05.760]  has the same first overall pick.
[50:05.800 --> 50:08.400]  All I'm saying is 40% of the group picked
[50:08.400 --> 50:09.420]  rock candy first.
[50:12.120 --> 50:14.480]  Can I share the origin of this
[50:14.480 --> 50:15.640]  really dumb draft idea?
[50:15.640 --> 50:16.340]  Yeah.
[50:16.460 --> 50:19.300]  I was watching old
[50:20.340 --> 50:20.820]  VHS
[50:22.280 --> 50:23.520]  instructional type videos
[50:23.520 --> 50:25.200]  and there is a great
[50:25.720 --> 50:27.560]  awful one called Rock's Winning
[50:27.560 --> 50:29.120]  Workout. Let me introduce you to Rock.
[50:29.620 --> 50:31.020]  This is the start of this idea.
[50:31.640 --> 50:33.860]  This is Rock's informational video
[50:34.780 --> 50:35.720]  called Rock's
[50:35.720 --> 50:36.920]  Winning Workout Without Weight.
[50:37.360 --> 50:39.640]  I can't tell if that's a lower third or whether it's written
[50:39.640 --> 50:41.020]  on his shirt. What is that?
[50:42.220 --> 50:43.300]  It's a lower third.
[50:44.540 --> 50:45.160]  It's great.
[50:45.360 --> 50:47.160]  It's a tape where he shows how to work out,
[50:47.260 --> 50:48.620]  but doesn't do any working out himself.
[50:48.800 --> 50:51.340]  It feels like he's got a homeless guy doing squats
[50:51.820 --> 50:52.880]  that he's friends with.
[50:53.320 --> 50:55.100]  The middle of the tape is interrupted by this
[50:55.100 --> 50:57.000]  80-year-old man discussing how the
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.120]  prohibition should come back because
[50:59.120 --> 51:01.400]  he hates alcohol. It is fantastic.
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.280]  That is the origin of this.
[51:03.360 --> 51:05.180]  I saw that and I was like, huh, there's a lot of
[51:05.180 --> 51:06.360]  rocks that aren't rocks.
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.940]  That's how this all came to be.
[51:09.060 --> 51:10.640]  Definitely the thumbnail I'm going to use.
[51:11.680 --> 51:12.400]  That's amazing.
[51:15.240 --> 51:16.580]  He's got such a like, he's got his arms
[51:16.580 --> 51:18.340]  on his side and he's like...
[51:18.920 --> 51:20.700]  It's not the posture of a dude who's
[51:20.700 --> 51:21.880]  about to teach you how to work out.
[51:23.340 --> 51:24.680]  He just looks disappointed.
[51:25.220 --> 51:26.720]  He looks like a Far Cry character.
[51:27.040 --> 51:28.380]  Like everything about the rock.
[51:28.900 --> 51:30.100]  The way he looks.
[51:31.260 --> 51:32.580]  He's great. I love him.
[51:33.020 --> 51:34.040]  Any other...
[51:34.800 --> 51:36.660]  Any other rock picks that we didn't
[51:36.660 --> 51:38.380]  get but we feel like should be honorable mentions?
[51:38.380 --> 51:40.440]  I mean, I had a huge list that I
[51:40.440 --> 51:42.820]  was surprised didn't get used.
[51:42.960 --> 51:44.160]  Yeah, I had a couple
[51:44.660 --> 51:46.100]  that we didn't use.
[51:46.480 --> 51:48.320]  You want to say yours?
[51:48.700 --> 51:50.000]  Rocco's Modern Life.
[51:50.340 --> 51:52.380]  I know Rocco was up for discussion but I
[51:52.380 --> 51:54.160]  completely had forgotten about that show.
[51:54.780 --> 51:56.480]  And then the Rock and Roller
[51:56.480 --> 51:58.100]  Coaster at Disney World.
[51:58.140 --> 51:58.160]  Oh!
[51:59.640 --> 52:01.300]  A Jack Pattillo pick, yeah.
[52:01.320 --> 52:03.840]  I don't think I would have let you get away with that if I picked Rock and Roll.
[52:05.220 --> 52:06.100]  Oh, interesting!
[52:07.000 --> 52:08.200]  But you let Geoff get away
[52:08.200 --> 52:09.100]  with Moon Rockers.
[52:10.840 --> 52:12.160]  Yeah, but they're like...
[52:12.160 --> 52:14.160]  I looked at pictures of them
[52:14.160 --> 52:16.140]  and that didn't look like Rock and Roll to me.
[52:16.720 --> 52:18.200]  They're more space music.
[52:19.120 --> 52:20.260]  Yeah, Gavin,
[52:20.440 --> 52:22.340]  what I meant is they're more space music.
[52:22.580 --> 52:22.780]  That's right.
[52:26.720 --> 52:27.940]  What else, Nick?
[52:28.820 --> 52:29.480]  And then,
[52:29.600 --> 52:30.760]  do you remember Fraggle Rock?
[52:31.200 --> 52:32.020]  Of course!
[52:32.600 --> 52:33.620]  It was on my board.
[52:33.620 --> 52:35.320]  It was on my board.
[52:35.680 --> 52:36.500]  Love Jim Henson.
[52:36.880 --> 52:38.660]  Nobody picked the Rockettes, either.
[52:39.400 --> 52:40.180]  That's true.
[52:40.940 --> 52:42.840]  Yeah, Fraggle Rock is great.
[52:43.140 --> 52:45.480]  Prudential, get a piece of the rock.
[52:45.660 --> 52:46.480]  We didn't pick that.
[52:47.500 --> 52:48.540]  Prudential Insurance.
[52:48.900 --> 52:51.500]  Andrew, do you want to run down your list of ones you didn't?
[52:51.720 --> 52:52.260]  Yeah, sure.
[52:52.340 --> 52:53.720]  I'm just going through.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.060]  We Will Rock You, Detroit Rock City,
[52:56.700 --> 52:57.000]  Rocky,
[52:58.680 --> 53:01.280]  I had Rock Candy 11
[53:01.280 --> 53:03.260]  when that was coming up on my list, originally,
[53:04.720 --> 53:05.440]  Rap Rock,
[53:05.640 --> 53:07.540]  Punk Rock, Hard Rock Cafe,
[53:08.760 --> 53:09.920]  Crack Rock 22,
[53:10.880 --> 53:11.280]  Crocodile Rock.
[53:11.280 --> 53:13.360]  Why does he shit on both of the things that were on his own list?
[53:13.400 --> 53:14.180]  I just don't understand.
[53:14.660 --> 53:16.480]  They're just lower on the list.
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.620]  Like, he doesn't see the same value
[53:20.380 --> 53:21.580]  in them as he does
[53:21.580 --> 53:22.660]  as Round Ball Rock.
[53:24.680 --> 53:25.760]  That's just my opinion, though.
[53:25.940 --> 53:27.860]  I could be wrong. Maybe I'll be greatly wrong.
[53:27.960 --> 53:29.840]  As we said, I think I might be in a Crack Rock bubble.
[53:29.840 --> 53:30.780]  We'll see.
[53:30.980 --> 53:32.820]  There's got to be a better way to say that.
[53:33.060 --> 53:35.840]  No, I think it's the perfect way. I am in a Crack Rock bubble.
[53:37.880 --> 53:39.760]  I'm just a Crack Rock hater, okay?
[53:39.880 --> 53:41.600]  I guess I need to own up to the fact.
[53:42.140 --> 53:42.660]  Just hate it.
[53:43.480 --> 53:45.240]  Oh, God. I love it.
[53:45.900 --> 53:47.620]  Not Crack Rock. I don't love Crack Rock.
[53:48.980 --> 53:50.680]  I love how stupid this is.
[53:50.920 --> 53:52.200]  And we have to do this again
[53:52.200 --> 53:52.740]  right after.
[53:52.740 --> 53:54.060]  We're going to do it one more time.
[53:54.960 --> 53:55.900]  So we should wrap this up.
[53:55.900 --> 53:57.800]  I also have a suggestion for our
[53:57.800 --> 53:59.020]  fourth draft.
[53:59.280 --> 54:01.960]  I have a very funny story about this.
[54:02.560 --> 54:03.760]  Oh, do you?
[54:03.900 --> 54:05.940]  Is it a different one? Because you pitched me one.
[54:06.380 --> 54:07.680]  Yeah, no, it's a different one.
[54:08.040 --> 54:08.740]  Okay, go ahead.
[54:09.440 --> 54:09.860]  Fools.
[54:11.220 --> 54:13.500]  I think we should do a Fools 2.
[54:14.600 --> 54:15.760]  Oh, I thought you said balls.
[54:16.060 --> 54:17.860]  Me too. I absolutely thought
[54:17.860 --> 54:18.720]  he said balls.
[54:20.100 --> 54:20.520]  Fools.
[54:22.400 --> 54:23.780]  Because there are so many
[54:23.780 --> 54:25.220]  good fools that I forgot about.
[54:25.420 --> 54:27.460]  You want to just redo our first draft?
[54:30.000 --> 54:31.900]  I just wanted to come back around
[54:31.900 --> 54:32.360]  to fools.
[54:32.660 --> 54:35.080]  We definitely need to do a Fools round 2.
[54:35.180 --> 54:38.060]  I want to do one that just falls from Sloppy Joes.
[54:39.320 --> 54:39.840]  I've been
[54:39.840 --> 54:41.060]  saving enough of them.
[54:44.200 --> 54:45.260]  Weeks ago, after
[54:45.780 --> 54:47.120]  we recorded an episode,
[54:47.580 --> 54:50.060]  Gavin, once again, shit on this idea.
[54:50.360 --> 54:51.280]  Just the two of us.
[54:51.280 --> 54:52.520]  And I was like, well, you know what?
[54:52.680 --> 54:55.340]  You come up with a draft idea. What do you think would be a
[54:55.340 --> 54:57.280]  great draft topic? And he said
[54:57.280 --> 54:59.040]  explosions. And I was like, you know what?
[54:59.060 --> 55:00.780]  It's pretty good. I kind of like that.
[55:01.420 --> 55:02.240]  Explosions is fun.
[55:02.740 --> 55:04.760]  Videos of really good explosions.
[55:06.240 --> 55:07.260]  I like explosions
[55:07.260 --> 55:09.340]  as an option. But next one, our next
[55:09.340 --> 55:10.740]  draft is malls.
[55:11.320 --> 55:12.960]  If we are all a mall,
[55:13.300 --> 55:14.420]  what stores would we have?
[55:14.960 --> 55:17.240]  I don't think this episode suffered
[55:17.240 --> 55:18.880]  in any way by not being video.
[55:18.880 --> 55:20.220]  No. Not at all.
[55:20.580 --> 55:22.680]  I agree. Why would it need to be video?
[55:23.040 --> 55:24.060]  It doesn't. That's what I'm saying.
[55:24.460 --> 55:26.460]  The falls one
[55:26.460 --> 55:28.880]  had falls that we watched. This was just
[55:28.880 --> 55:30.660]  images of the moon rockers
[55:30.660 --> 55:31.360]  or whatever.
[55:32.380 --> 55:34.700]  It never needed to be video to begin with.
[55:34.940 --> 55:36.760]  The video version of this will actually have
[55:36.760 --> 55:38.320]  more in it than the falls.
[55:38.320 --> 55:38.860]  It will.
[55:42.080 --> 55:42.960]  I can't
[55:42.960 --> 55:45.100]  believe that we're coming up on an hour of this draft.
[55:45.280 --> 55:47.080]  I thought this would be like 20-30 minutes.
[55:47.080 --> 55:48.600]  I wanted to do both of them together
[55:48.600 --> 55:50.540]  because I thought neither of them would be long enough
[55:50.960 --> 55:53.080]  on their own. We've done 150
[55:53.080 --> 55:54.600]  episodes of the podcast
[55:54.600 --> 55:56.880]  and I don't know how you guys always come in
[55:56.880 --> 55:58.220]  and go like, I don't know about this one.
[55:58.420 --> 55:59.840]  I don't know if we have anything.
[56:00.240 --> 56:02.660]  It's an hour and a half of what animal
[56:02.660 --> 56:04.600]  is most sneaky that just sets
[56:04.600 --> 56:05.880]  everyone on a fucking tizzy.
[56:06.440 --> 56:08.440]  We're always good. We're going to be fine.
[56:08.940 --> 56:10.480]  Well, listen to the
[56:12.400 --> 56:13.280]  Face podcast.
[56:13.840 --> 56:14.980]  If you listen to this
[56:14.980 --> 56:16.540]  and you don't listen to the regular podcast,
[56:16.640 --> 56:18.960]  that's absurd. So thank you
[56:18.960 --> 56:20.700]  for listening to this. You guys have any
[56:20.700 --> 56:22.720]  parting words for the people
[56:22.720 --> 56:24.520]  listening to this
[56:25.700 --> 56:26.700]  draft list?
[56:27.180 --> 56:28.020]  Say no to crack.
[56:30.180 --> 56:30.880]  Don't do
[56:30.880 --> 56:33.040]  or sell drugs, although it is
[56:33.040 --> 56:34.940]  a way more lucrative way to go
[56:34.940 --> 56:36.860]  about it than trying to, I don't know, license
[56:36.860 --> 56:37.640]  round ball rock.
[56:39.140 --> 56:40.940]  Be on the lookout
[56:40.940 --> 56:42.740]  for our next draft.
[56:42.740 --> 56:44.860]  Mall draft. It's going to be amazing.
[56:44.900 --> 56:46.660]  If you thought this sucked, wait until you see
[56:46.660 --> 56:47.560]  the mall draft.
[56:52.210 --> 56:53.190]  I guess I just
[56:53.190 --> 56:54.150]  want to apologize again.
