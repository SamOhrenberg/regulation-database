[00:14.700 --> 00:18.140]  Let it be known, audience, please put this in the video.
[00:18.280 --> 00:20.680]  I told you. I told you how to do it.
[00:21.140 --> 00:27.900]  Something was just born off-camera that I hope continues for the rest of the future of this podcast.
[00:29.280 --> 00:29.700]  You're welcome.
[00:29.760 --> 00:30.340]  Don't like the sound of that.
[00:31.840 --> 00:34.180]  I think you did like the sound of it, that's why you're here.
[00:34.740 --> 00:41.460]  Hello and welcome to a Christmas Smorgasbord movie draft special.
[00:41.460 --> 00:45.060]  You know, when we do our drafts, like we did the, uh...
[00:45.060 --> 00:48.340]  Man, somebody asked me, I was hanging out with Antonio and Bernie last night playing trucks,
[00:48.480 --> 00:50.680]  and they asked me, I was talking about having to do the draft today,
[00:50.920 --> 00:52.940]  and they said, like, explain what it is.
[00:52.980 --> 00:55.780]  And I went, okay, well, it's like, we've done these other drafts, we've done...
[00:55.780 --> 00:58.840]  And I realized I couldn't remember a single draft except for the mall draft.
[01:00.120 --> 01:01.520]  How many other ones have we done?
[01:02.640 --> 01:04.200]  Uh, five or six, maybe?
[01:04.240 --> 01:05.540]  Yeah, rock, not rock.
[01:06.140 --> 01:07.320]  Rocks! That was one.
[01:07.600 --> 01:08.600]  What are some of the other ones?
[01:08.600 --> 01:10.860]  Uh, we did the mall draft.
[01:11.200 --> 01:13.180]  We did the mall. Movies.
[01:13.380 --> 01:14.660]  Yeah. Summer 98.
[01:14.900 --> 01:16.520]  Yeah, the Summer 98 movies. States.
[01:17.100 --> 01:18.400]  Ads. TV ads.
[01:19.160 --> 01:19.940]  Yeah, Falls.
[01:20.440 --> 01:21.320]  That was our first one.
[01:21.900 --> 01:24.000]  Oh, the Falls draft. God, I couldn't remember any of those.
[01:24.500 --> 01:25.880]  Clearly left a big impression on me.
[01:26.380 --> 01:28.060]  Speaking of big impressions, though,
[01:28.180 --> 01:31.060]  today we're gonna be drafting our favorite...
[01:31.060 --> 01:32.960]  Is it our favorite Christmas movies,
[01:33.080 --> 01:35.020]  or do we think, like, the most iconic Christmas movies?
[01:35.100 --> 01:35.840]  How do we phrase it?
[01:35.840 --> 01:38.240]  The best Christmas movies, in our opinion.
[01:38.720 --> 01:40.200]  Okay, that tracks
[01:40.200 --> 01:42.200]  with what I selected, so that works.
[01:42.820 --> 01:44.220]  I think it's sort of up to you
[01:44.220 --> 01:45.920]  to decide, like, do you want to
[01:45.920 --> 01:48.000]  try to win this and, like, go for what you think
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.220]  are more popular picks, or do you want to
[01:50.220 --> 01:51.840]  be more true to yourself
[01:51.840 --> 01:53.700]  and what's in your... I'm in it to win.
[01:53.780 --> 01:55.720]  ...top four. Okay, I'm excited.
[01:55.900 --> 01:57.700]  Luckily for me,
[01:57.860 --> 01:59.460]  both things are true at the same time.
[02:00.500 --> 02:00.900]  Ooh!
[02:01.820 --> 02:03.560]  Look at Geoff, man of the people.
[02:03.560 --> 02:04.740]  Mr. Culture.
[02:05.840 --> 02:07.640]  Personal interests perfectly connect
[02:07.640 --> 02:09.220]  with also popular interests.
[02:10.000 --> 02:10.360]  Crazy.
[02:11.620 --> 02:13.580]  So we're gonna do... we're gonna determine draft
[02:13.580 --> 02:15.140]  order. I have a little bit of a spin,
[02:15.420 --> 02:17.540]  a little twist to this draft process.
[02:17.840 --> 02:19.000]  The picking order.
[02:19.580 --> 02:21.320]  That is gonna run by you guys. Blindside!
[02:21.700 --> 02:23.600]  No, not a blindside. I've talked to
[02:23.600 --> 02:25.440]  most... I think I've talked to everyone about this,
[02:25.480 --> 02:27.040]  except maybe Gavin?
[02:27.540 --> 02:29.600]  Oh. So we're gonna do the randomizer right
[02:29.600 --> 02:31.280]  now, which is what Eric pulled up. We're gonna
[02:31.280 --> 02:33.400]  randomize the names, and then whoever
[02:33.400 --> 02:35.560]  is at the top, when we randomize
[02:35.560 --> 02:37.140]  it however many times, they're first,
[02:37.280 --> 02:39.320]  typically. Instead of that
[02:39.320 --> 02:41.380]  being the first pick, they get to
[02:41.380 --> 02:43.160]  pick where they want to draft.
[02:43.660 --> 02:45.360]  So let's say I'm at the
[02:45.360 --> 02:47.380]  top, I can say I wanna pick third.
[02:47.840 --> 02:49.380]  And then it goes to the second person
[02:49.380 --> 02:51.240]  and then they pick where they wanna draft.
[02:51.720 --> 02:52.540]  And we just go down the line.
[02:54.060 --> 02:55.440]  That would necessarily
[02:55.440 --> 02:57.400]  complicate it. No, because there's
[02:57.400 --> 02:59.360]  a strategic edge
[02:59.360 --> 03:01.180]  to this. I think,
[03:01.320 --> 03:03.320]  in my opinion, there is a
[03:03.320 --> 03:05.020]  top two in this draft,
[03:05.360 --> 03:07.380]  but in the music draft, I'd wanna be
[03:07.380 --> 03:09.200]  five. How about this? I'd like,
[03:09.260 --> 03:11.320]  how about this? So, I like where
[03:11.320 --> 03:13.220]  you're going with it. I'd like to add one more
[03:13.220 --> 03:15.200]  twist to it. Okay. When
[03:15.200 --> 03:17.460]  you get picked, you get to pick what order
[03:17.460 --> 03:19.300]  you draft in, right? Yes.
[03:19.320 --> 03:21.360]  That's what you're saying? Like if I roll first, I can say
[03:21.360 --> 03:23.280]  like, Gavin goes first, I get
[03:23.280 --> 03:25.040]  the second, I can pick second, third, or fourth.
[03:25.420 --> 03:27.380]  What if instead of choosing where
[03:27.380 --> 03:29.360]  I go, can I pick where, can I
[03:29.360 --> 03:31.560]  move Gavin? Sure. Why not?
[03:32.020 --> 03:33.360]  So like, instead of me
[03:33.360 --> 03:35.180]  getting to pick my place in the draft,
[03:35.340 --> 03:37.380]  I can use that pick to move somebody else's
[03:37.380 --> 03:39.420]  place. But you still, no, no, no, no,
[03:39.420 --> 03:41.380]  because you still have to be on the board.
[03:41.620 --> 03:43.420]  This is why, this is why none of this
[03:43.420 --> 03:45.400]  works. No, you can't. I wanna add that if you
[03:45.400 --> 03:47.500]  go fourth at the end of the draft, you can
[03:47.500 --> 03:49.260]  take someone's entire picks.
[03:50.160 --> 03:50.520]  Okay.
[03:51.580 --> 03:53.440]  I like that. Why don't, no, let that,
[03:53.600 --> 03:55.400]  why don't we do the last
[03:55.400 --> 03:57.440]  pick either has to live with what
[03:57.440 --> 03:59.040]  they have, or they can take any pick.
[03:59.760 --> 04:01.540]  And everyone slides down from that point.
[04:01.660 --> 04:02.740]  A white elephant draft?
[04:03.940 --> 04:05.540]  Oh, I was just kidding, cause it's
[04:05.540 --> 04:07.140]  stupid. If it helps
[04:07.140 --> 04:09.020]  audience, I'm against this.
[04:09.500 --> 04:11.540]  So, I'm with you guys. Let's just do my idea
[04:11.540 --> 04:13.320]  and then we'll, how about we evolve?
[04:13.580 --> 04:15.160]  Let's just start basic. Let's just do Andrew's idea.
[04:15.440 --> 04:17.280]  And then we'll go from there. So let's, let's,
[04:17.320 --> 04:18.620]  how many randomizers are we gonna do?
[04:19.280 --> 04:21.140]  Uh, what's a Christmassy number? Twelve.
[04:22.380 --> 04:23.300]  For the twelve days of Christmas.
[04:23.300 --> 04:24.660]  Okay. Okay.
[04:24.780 --> 04:26.300]  Oh, what's advanced mode?
[04:27.500 --> 04:29.460]  I don't know. Switch to advanced
[04:29.460 --> 04:31.620]  mode. Are we ready?
[04:32.380 --> 04:33.400]  Oh no, that looks
[04:33.400 --> 04:35.280]  way, no, no, that's
[04:35.280 --> 04:37.520]  way too much. That's way too advanced.
[04:37.980 --> 04:39.140]  We could use, no,
[04:39.640 --> 04:41.300]  look, we could use pre-randomization
[04:42.300 --> 04:43.340]  generated from a
[04:43.340 --> 04:45.260]  specific date, like Christmas
[04:45.260 --> 04:45.820]  day.
[04:47.920 --> 04:49.360]  But I have
[04:49.360 --> 04:51.340]  to randomize this twelve times.
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.440]  Yeah, but randomize
[04:53.440 --> 04:54.600]  it from Christmas.
[04:55.100 --> 04:57.640]  Guys, if you were expecting a draft and you're
[04:57.640 --> 04:59.340]  about six minutes into this,
[04:59.440 --> 05:01.580]  really sorry we haven't gotten to it yet.
[05:01.700 --> 05:02.580]  We're almost there.
[05:03.180 --> 05:04.940]  I'm gonna go back to simple mode.
[05:11.220 --> 05:13.320]  And I'm gonna randomize twelve
[05:13.320 --> 05:15.360]  times. There's one.
[05:16.380 --> 05:17.020]  Two.
[05:17.300 --> 05:19.480]  Three. He was excited.
[05:19.480 --> 05:21.700]  We said we're gonna do it twelve times.
[05:21.780 --> 05:23.220]  He was excited on one.
[05:23.280 --> 05:25.400]  I'm not gonna share every time I'm at the top.
[05:25.800 --> 05:25.840]  Four.
[05:29.280 --> 05:29.960]  Six.
[05:31.320 --> 05:32.000]  Eight.
[05:34.520 --> 05:35.200]  Nine.
[05:36.420 --> 05:37.100]  Ten.
[05:38.220 --> 05:39.900]  Eleven. And here is
[05:40.740 --> 05:41.420]  twelve.
[05:41.840 --> 05:42.300]  Hey!
[05:44.800 --> 05:45.480]  Okay,
[05:45.620 --> 05:46.900]  Gavin, which
[05:46.900 --> 05:48.420]  which spot
[05:48.420 --> 05:50.560]  do you wanna go in here?
[05:51.300 --> 05:52.040]  What are you gonna pick?
[05:52.440 --> 05:54.380]  Well, first, obviously, it would be stupid to go
[05:54.720 --> 05:55.520]  in the first.
[05:55.820 --> 05:57.680]  Yeah, no, a hundred percent.
[05:58.320 --> 06:00.120]  I completely agree with you.
[06:00.680 --> 06:02.160]  I mean, Gavin,
[06:02.660 --> 06:03.780]  you're absolutely right.
[06:04.600 --> 06:06.700]  See, I think there's a
[06:06.700 --> 06:08.760]  top two, and I wouldn't want
[06:08.760 --> 06:09.860]  first. I'd want second.
[06:10.360 --> 06:12.680]  So, Andrew, does Andrew
[06:12.680 --> 06:14.760]  now pick his place? I believe so.
[06:14.760 --> 06:15.960]  I want second.
[06:16.360 --> 06:16.800]  Okay.
[06:19.900 --> 06:20.340]  This...
[06:21.280 --> 06:22.780]  This is about to turn
[06:22.780 --> 06:24.900]  into the biggest waste of time.
[06:25.140 --> 06:26.840]  We're dropping ourselves for the draft.
[06:26.940 --> 06:28.360]  Hey, hey, guys,
[06:28.580 --> 06:29.820]  I'm third.
[06:30.420 --> 06:32.040]  I'm gonna go ahead and pick three.
[06:33.100 --> 06:34.540]  See, I think that's a mistake.
[06:34.620 --> 06:36.200]  If I was third, I would go five.
[06:36.360 --> 06:38.300]  And here we go, Nick, you're fourth.
[06:38.600 --> 06:41.220]  Oh, take a big guess. I would go five.
[06:41.580 --> 06:42.540]  Nick, where do you wanna be?
[06:42.540 --> 06:44.440]  I wanna be four.
[06:44.820 --> 06:45.740]  Oh, that's fantastic!
[06:45.760 --> 06:47.340]  Eric and Nick are both fools.
[06:48.080 --> 06:49.480]  So now, hold on a second.
[06:50.240 --> 06:51.640]  Don't put my name down there yet.
[06:51.700 --> 06:54.400]  You told me that with my pick,
[06:54.460 --> 06:55.460]  I can pick what place I want.
[06:55.520 --> 06:58.120]  No, no, no. We're not doing that.
[06:58.860 --> 07:00.320]  We're not doing your
[07:01.000 --> 07:02.340]  unnecessarily complicated thing.
[07:02.400 --> 07:03.860]  We're starting with the base idea.
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.580]  No, you said I can pick where I want.
[07:06.620 --> 07:07.260]  I wanna go first.
[07:07.280 --> 07:09.960]  No, you didn't hear correctly. You can go back and listen later.
[07:09.960 --> 07:11.580]  We went back to the original idea.
[07:11.800 --> 07:14.020]  Yeah, rewind this about five minutes
[07:14.020 --> 07:15.900]  where we're still trying to figure out the rules
[07:15.900 --> 07:18.020]  for some reason of the draft order.
[07:18.280 --> 07:19.920]  But Nick is fourth, though,
[07:19.980 --> 07:21.520]  so he can pick anyone's full team.
[07:22.860 --> 07:23.980]  Right. Nick is fourth,
[07:24.040 --> 07:25.160]  so he can pick any full team.
[07:25.560 --> 07:26.400]  A draft draft.
[07:26.880 --> 07:29.860]  And everyone else has to compete in a sack race to see who goes next.
[07:30.300 --> 07:31.480]  Are you feeling good about this, Andrew?
[07:32.220 --> 07:33.920]  I'm happy, because I, in my head,
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.020]  top two, and then there's a big drop-off,
[07:36.120 --> 07:37.500]  and I would go five,
[07:37.500 --> 07:38.940]  so I could get the 5-6.
[07:39.480 --> 07:40.420]  I want the turn.
[07:40.820 --> 07:43.620]  Now, once during the draft, we're allowed to use
[07:43.620 --> 07:45.340]  our pick to cancel out someone else's pick, right?
[07:45.340 --> 07:46.440]  No. No.
[07:46.560 --> 07:48.340]  So then neither of us get a pick for that round?
[07:49.180 --> 07:51.820]  I'm enacting that. I don't want Andrew to pick in round one.
[07:52.040 --> 07:53.080]  I'm using that rule.
[07:53.160 --> 07:55.220]  That's too bad. We can figure this out later.
[07:55.280 --> 07:57.160]  You can't just add rules like that in the middle of a draft.
[07:57.160 --> 07:59.180]  You just did it this fucking draft!
[07:59.660 --> 08:01.640]  No, I didn't. I did it before we started.
[08:01.680 --> 08:02.980]  And I don't want him to pick in round two.
[08:03.040 --> 08:04.180]  Before. Not during.
[08:04.180 --> 08:06.740]  You didn't even tell Gavin about it until right now.
[08:06.880 --> 08:07.980]  So it couldn't have been official.
[08:08.240 --> 08:09.940]  Eric, do you want Andrew to pick in round three?
[08:10.440 --> 08:12.060]  I want everyone to pick
[08:12.060 --> 08:13.480]  in all of the rounds.
[08:13.680 --> 08:15.140]  I want to do the draft.
[08:15.320 --> 08:16.340]  I don't understand.
[08:16.940 --> 08:19.840]  The idea of reinventing the draft
[08:19.840 --> 08:21.360]  is so insane.
[08:21.660 --> 08:24.200]  Well, you just made us draft ourselves for some reason.
[08:24.780 --> 08:25.920]  I know. No, you'll see.
[08:26.200 --> 08:27.320]  And look at what happens.
[08:27.780 --> 08:29.320]  We randomized 12 times.
[08:29.520 --> 08:31.280]  Gavin, Andrew, Eric, Nick, Geoff.
[08:31.280 --> 08:33.280]  And our picking order after choosing
[08:33.280 --> 08:35.740]  where we go is Gavin, Andrew, Eric, Nick, Geoff.
[08:36.040 --> 08:37.300]  It's not my fault
[08:37.300 --> 08:39.320]  that three and four were dumb
[08:39.320 --> 08:40.520]  moves by you guys.
[08:40.600 --> 08:41.800]  That's not on me.
[08:42.620 --> 08:44.780]  You'll see. Just trust me.
[08:45.100 --> 08:45.740]  This will work out.
[08:46.620 --> 08:49.640]  Maybe not this draft, but this will come into play.
[08:49.840 --> 08:50.520]  Maybe not this draft.
[08:51.460 --> 08:53.520]  Maybe not this draft.
[08:53.520 --> 08:55.260]  Well, because you guys don't have
[08:55.260 --> 08:57.240]  the vision that I have with this.
[08:57.260 --> 08:58.880]  So you all fell in the line.
[08:59.760 --> 09:01.160]  I picked Die Hard.
[09:01.420 --> 09:02.620]  Oh, Christ.
[09:03.020 --> 09:03.940]  Gavin picks Die Hard.
[09:04.320 --> 09:07.860]  What a lame first pick.
[09:08.420 --> 09:08.940]  Dude, listen.
[09:09.140 --> 09:11.020]  Don't be talking shit about that movie.
[09:11.220 --> 09:11.880]  It's a good movie.
[09:12.040 --> 09:14.840]  I'm not. I'm fatigued
[09:14.840 --> 09:16.800]  of arguing about whether Die Hard
[09:16.800 --> 09:18.120]  is a Christmas movie. I don't care.
[09:18.240 --> 09:20.540]  There's no argument. It's a Christmas movie.
[09:21.420 --> 09:22.620]  Andrew was saying
[09:22.620 --> 09:24.500]  before we started recording, he was
[09:24.500 --> 09:26.600]  talking about how he's exhausted
[09:26.600 --> 09:28.160]  by the conversations about it.
[09:28.220 --> 09:29.960]  And I kept saying, we should probably save that for
[09:30.680 --> 09:32.420]  this recording. Because I don't think
[09:32.420 --> 09:34.700]  any of us are going to argue that it's not a Christmas movie.
[09:34.820 --> 09:35.860]  No, I'm not going to argue.
[09:36.120 --> 09:38.620]  I'm more... I hate the people
[09:38.620 --> 09:40.200]  that argue. Here's the thing with Die Hard.
[09:40.500 --> 09:42.380]  There are Christmas movies that I want to watch
[09:42.880 --> 09:44.400]  multiple times. Maybe once every
[09:44.400 --> 09:46.800]  couple of Christmases. I'll watch Die Hard any time
[09:46.800 --> 09:48.880]  of the year. And that's why it's a great Christmas movie.
[09:49.500 --> 09:50.840]  I feel like you could argue
[09:50.840 --> 09:52.600]  that's why it's not a great Christmas movie.
[09:53.020 --> 09:54.600]  Oh, that's weird. It's a Christmas movie
[09:54.600 --> 09:56.640]  so good it stands tall
[09:56.640 --> 09:58.780]  and proud in June. It can be
[09:58.780 --> 10:00.760]  two things at once. Geoff, it sounds like
[10:00.760 --> 10:02.680]  Andrew is arguing that it's not a Christmas movie.
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.680]  I'm not. I'm getting a hint of an
[10:04.680 --> 10:06.180]  argument. I'm not. No.
[10:06.300 --> 10:08.740]  You just presented a counter argument to Gavin.
[10:08.960 --> 10:10.640]  That's like, that's step one in arguing.
[10:10.900 --> 10:12.540]  I presented a counter argument
[10:12.540 --> 10:14.820]  that it's the number one Christmas movie
[10:14.820 --> 10:16.640]  of all time. Not that it is
[10:16.640 --> 10:18.760]  a Christmas movie or not. I'm just
[10:18.760 --> 10:20.620]  saying that if it plays so well
[10:20.620 --> 10:22.580]  out of season, maybe
[10:22.580 --> 10:24.580]  it's not the greatest Christmas movie
[10:24.580 --> 10:26.740]  of all time, but a good Christmas movie.
[10:26.800 --> 10:28.640]  Well, according
[10:28.640 --> 10:30.340]  to our draft
[10:30.340 --> 10:32.500]  that we all agreed upon,
[10:32.620 --> 10:34.760]  it is now officially the greatest Christmas
[10:34.760 --> 10:36.160]  movie of all time. We did it!
[10:36.160 --> 10:38.480]  They're a draft bus all the time, Geoff.
[10:38.600 --> 10:40.300]  Round one, pick one.
[10:40.740 --> 10:42.520]  Round one, pick one does not mean that
[10:42.520 --> 10:44.520]  that is going to be the best player in the draft.
[10:44.520 --> 10:46.380]  Dude, you can't call a proven
[10:46.380 --> 10:48.480]  success. It's not Greg Oden.
[10:48.680 --> 10:50.560]  We don't have to wait and see if
[10:50.560 --> 10:52.380]  his knees are going to hold up. It's
[10:52.380 --> 10:54.280]  goddamn LeBron James. He's got 21
[10:54.280 --> 10:56.180]  years of MVP stats behind him.
[10:56.400 --> 10:58.460]  I know, but I'm arguing more the LeBron
[10:58.460 --> 11:00.620]  James versus Michael Jordan argument
[11:00.620 --> 11:02.500]  where they're both great, but it's an
[11:02.500 --> 11:04.320]  opinion of whose greatness is better.
[11:04.580 --> 11:06.600]  I'm saying I think there's other greatness
[11:06.600 --> 11:08.560]  that's ahead of Die Hard, in my
[11:08.560 --> 11:10.580]  opinion. Well, you're certainly in a
[11:10.580 --> 11:12.360]  position to tell us what the second best
[11:12.360 --> 11:14.440]  Christmas movie of all time is. See, this is
[11:14.440 --> 11:16.380]  the problem. I would have taken third if I knew
[11:16.380 --> 11:17.940]  that Gavin was going to go with Die Hard.
[11:17.940 --> 11:19.780]  Well, how would you? That is the
[11:19.780 --> 11:21.600]  only movie I thought Gavin would pick.
[11:22.180 --> 11:23.960]  I've made some projections, by the
[11:23.960 --> 11:25.900]  way, based on how much time has been
[11:25.900 --> 11:27.740]  spent on the first pick and how many we have remaining.
[11:27.840 --> 11:30.080]  This will be a 176-minute
[11:30.080 --> 11:31.320]  recording. Oh, God!
[11:31.780 --> 11:33.040]  It's going to take so long to edit!
[11:34.000 --> 11:35.400]  It's almost as long as the Titanic.
[11:36.460 --> 11:37.700]  No, this is going to be easy.
[11:37.920 --> 11:39.800]  You just chop off the head and the tail and export.
[11:40.040 --> 11:41.840]  It's fine. So with my
[11:41.840 --> 11:44.000]  dogshit first pick, Andrew now wishes
[11:44.000 --> 11:45.880]  he was third pick. No! Not
[11:45.880 --> 11:47.820]  dogshit! Yeah, I don't understand why he said
[11:47.820 --> 11:49.800]  that third and fourth were bad picks. And then he
[11:49.800 --> 11:51.900]  said that Gavin's number one pick was
[11:51.900 --> 11:54.020]  so bad it makes his number two pick
[11:54.020 --> 11:55.720]  bad. How does that make sense?
[11:55.760 --> 11:57.440]  No, no, let me explain.
[11:57.900 --> 11:59.680]  So I have a draft board right now
[11:59.680 --> 12:01.540]  and Die Hard is 20
[12:01.540 --> 12:03.780]  on my list of 20 for my draft
[12:03.780 --> 12:05.860]  board. In my head, there
[12:05.860 --> 12:07.880]  is a clear top two and I
[12:07.880 --> 12:09.940]  assume that anyone who went first would take
[12:09.940 --> 12:11.540]  one of those two, but
[12:11.540 --> 12:13.720]  they're both still on the board. So
[12:13.720 --> 12:15.700]  I should have went to three. I thought I needed
[12:15.700 --> 12:17.520]  to be in top two to make sure I got one of these,
[12:17.800 --> 12:19.680]  but that was not the case. Crack rock.
[12:19.900 --> 12:21.700]  What it sounds like to me is
[12:21.700 --> 12:23.680]  Gavin's scout saw something different
[12:23.680 --> 12:25.780]  in training camp than you did. It's true. Yes.
[12:26.240 --> 12:27.360]  Yes, it is. I did.
[12:27.580 --> 12:29.840]  I have to decide. Oh, this is tough. I didn't even...
[12:29.840 --> 12:31.480]  Oh, 220 minutes. It wasn't 100.
[12:31.800 --> 12:32.560]  I took the math wrong.
[12:34.980 --> 12:35.760]  Oh, man.
[12:35.920 --> 12:37.720]  These are... I'm really struggling with
[12:37.720 --> 12:39.900]  this first pick. Only 15
[12:39.900 --> 12:40.880]  picks to go.
[12:43.720 --> 12:44.820]  Oh, shit, that's not even right.
[12:45.080 --> 12:47.760]  Yeah, that's what the math
[12:47.760 --> 12:49.300]  I did wrong. I didn't realize I'm at 20.
[12:49.420 --> 12:50.780]  I timesed it by 16.
[12:51.700 --> 12:52.900]  I did the same thing.
[12:53.720 --> 12:55.660]  I'm gonna go with... and this
[12:55.660 --> 12:57.260]  is tough, because I think there's another
[12:57.260 --> 12:59.620]  top pick. I'm gonna go with Christmas
[12:59.620 --> 13:01.540]  Vacation. It's an iconic
[13:01.540 --> 13:03.680]  Christmas movie. It is
[13:04.320 --> 13:05.660]  the first... I think it's
[13:05.660 --> 13:07.520]  maybe the first time I, like,
[13:07.780 --> 13:09.640]  cried laughing at any piece
[13:09.640 --> 13:11.800]  of content. As a kid, the scene
[13:11.800 --> 13:13.940]  where he's putting up Christmas lights
[13:13.940 --> 13:15.920]  and he falls off the gutter, and then
[13:15.920 --> 13:17.560]  he launches the gutter through the
[13:17.560 --> 13:19.460]  neighbor's window. The ice?
[13:20.300 --> 13:21.860]  Yeah. I could not...
[13:21.860 --> 13:23.680]  I died. I was... I have a
[13:23.680 --> 13:25.840]  clear memory of me sitting in bed, watching
[13:25.840 --> 13:26.880]  that movie for the first time,
[13:27.800 --> 13:29.740]  crying laughing, to the point
[13:29.740 --> 13:31.840]  where I rewound it and rewatched it
[13:31.840 --> 13:33.800]  like eight times in a row, and then
[13:33.800 --> 13:35.920]  watched it frame by frame, still
[13:35.920 --> 13:37.700]  laughing, because I just learned how to do that.
[13:37.920 --> 13:39.820]  Which is maybe influenced why I thought Gavin would
[13:39.820 --> 13:41.820]  pick it. One of my first experiences trying to
[13:41.820 --> 13:43.000]  make anything slow motion.
[13:44.260 --> 13:45.460]  All-time movie.
[13:45.580 --> 13:47.820]  I think we talked about it before as well, but I think one of the
[13:47.820 --> 13:49.740]  best shots ever filmed in any movie is
[13:49.740 --> 13:51.760]  his feet coming through the ceiling and landing on the ground.
[13:51.760 --> 13:53.880]  Oh, it's so funny. Oh, it's so good. The scene
[13:53.880 --> 13:55.820]  where he fucking goes down the hill
[13:55.820 --> 13:57.680]  with the greased-ups. Oh, it's so good.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.880]  I gotta say, having seen that movie
[13:59.880 --> 14:01.680]  one zillion times, I
[14:01.680 --> 14:03.860]  love it. There's so many classic
[14:03.860 --> 14:05.720]  moments in it. But doesn't it feel
[14:05.720 --> 14:07.580]  15 minutes too long to you?
[14:07.580 --> 14:09.720]  I agree with that. Even though it's an old-timer.
[14:09.820 --> 14:11.900]  It just really slows
[14:11.900 --> 14:13.680]  down when he gets nostalgic
[14:13.680 --> 14:15.600]  in the attic. It recovers with the feet
[14:15.600 --> 14:17.460]  falling through, but god damn, dude.
[14:17.880 --> 14:19.660]  If you could cut 20 minutes out of that
[14:19.660 --> 14:21.580]  movie, it would be amazing. I think
[14:21.580 --> 14:23.740]  it's probably the best use of
[14:24.280 --> 14:25.580]  the word fuck
[14:25.580 --> 14:27.540]  and still being able to do
[14:27.540 --> 14:29.500]  a PG movie, where he says
[14:29.500 --> 14:31.600]  that they're gonna be like, it's gonna be
[14:31.600 --> 14:33.580]  the happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby
[14:33.580 --> 14:35.580]  tap-danced with Danny fucking K.
[14:35.580 --> 14:37.980]  is so funny
[14:37.980 --> 14:39.580]  to me, in like that little
[14:39.580 --> 14:41.740]  like, he's just so fed up. That moment
[14:41.740 --> 14:43.540]  is so funny. I still
[14:43.540 --> 14:45.440]  to this day, in my like
[14:45.440 --> 14:47.820]  I don't know, like average parlance
[14:47.820 --> 14:49.360]  I still say shit and rocks
[14:49.360 --> 14:49.780]  constantly.
[14:52.880 --> 14:53.400]  It's
[14:54.240 --> 14:55.720]  never left my vocabulary.
[14:56.260 --> 14:56.900]  We don't say that here.
[14:57.340 --> 14:59.240]  When he's dumping the septic tank and he just goes
[14:59.240 --> 15:01.980]  shitter's full with the cigarette.
[15:04.520 --> 15:05.560]  It's so...
[15:05.560 --> 15:07.460]  Great. It's on my list, but it's pretty far down
[15:07.460 --> 15:09.400]  my list, because with my pick
[15:10.180 --> 15:11.560]  I'm going with Love Actually
[15:11.560 --> 15:13.540]  which is one
[15:13.540 --> 15:15.860]  of my favorite movies
[15:15.860 --> 15:17.460]  not just Christmas
[15:17.460 --> 15:19.700]  movie, but like one of my favorite movies
[15:19.700 --> 15:21.780]  of all time. I love Love Actually.
[15:21.980 --> 15:23.060]  Really? It's such a great movie.
[15:23.160 --> 15:24.160]  What do you love about it?
[15:24.440 --> 15:27.020]  I think it's a great
[15:27.880 --> 15:29.540]  movie of so many different
[15:29.540 --> 15:31.260]  characters and so many different pieces
[15:31.260 --> 15:33.400]  that all come together that feel so
[15:33.400 --> 15:34.380]  Christmas to me.
[15:36.140 --> 15:37.500]  It's really fun. I feel
[15:37.500 --> 15:39.480]  it in my fingers. I feel it in my toes.
[15:39.980 --> 15:41.420]  I just think it's a really great...
[15:41.420 --> 15:43.220]  I love Love Actually. I think it's a great movie.
[15:43.700 --> 15:45.420]  I think it's... one of my favorite things about doing
[15:45.420 --> 15:47.320]  this draft is I would have never guessed that
[15:47.320 --> 15:49.060]  Eric really liked Love Actually.
[15:49.240 --> 15:50.700]  That feels so out of character.
[15:50.980 --> 15:53.120]  I just think it's such a fun movie. I love it.
[15:53.300 --> 15:55.540]  I wouldn't have thought that the best... his favorite thing about Love Actually
[15:55.540 --> 15:56.900]  is a wet, wet, wet song.
[15:57.960 --> 15:58.320]  Laughter
[16:00.260 --> 16:01.320]  I think that there's
[16:01.320 --> 16:03.260]  so many fun performances and so much
[16:03.260 --> 16:05.320]  goofy shit. Like the guys who are
[16:05.320 --> 16:07.080]  so British and then they're
[16:07.080 --> 16:09.140]  gonna go to America and America's gonna be
[16:09.140 --> 16:11.460]  a magic land. It's so
[16:11.460 --> 16:13.360]  fucking funny. That's how we think of it. It's so
[16:13.360 --> 16:15.300]  funny. I will say, I talked to
[16:15.300 --> 16:17.300]  TPG yesterday. His number
[16:17.300 --> 16:19.180]  one diehard. He said he
[16:19.180 --> 16:21.460]  used to be a Love Actually guy. Disavowed
[16:21.460 --> 16:23.120]  now. Doesn't like the movie. Wow.
[16:23.300 --> 16:25.380]  Rejects it. Thinks it doesn't hold up
[16:25.380 --> 16:27.260]  at all. I mean, it's just scenes.
[16:28.220 --> 16:29.580]  And I love
[16:30.200 --> 16:31.240]  all the scenes.
[16:31.940 --> 16:33.680]  Like, what I remember most about it and what
[16:33.680 --> 16:35.560]  I like most about it is watching it and going
[16:35.560 --> 16:37.420]  oh, I love this part. And then the next part comes and I go
[16:37.420 --> 16:39.260]  oh, I love this part. Because it's just
[16:39.700 --> 16:41.460]  jumping around in a way that I really enjoy.
[16:42.340 --> 16:43.660]  Alright. I don't like
[16:43.660 --> 16:45.060]  it in a lot of movies. I like it in that movie.
[16:45.440 --> 16:47.080]  Good pick. Thank you.
[16:47.220 --> 16:49.540]  Nick? I feel like I agree with you on that one
[16:49.540 --> 16:51.540]  because that's the one I like that jumps from
[16:51.540 --> 16:53.260]  person to person with so many characters.
[16:54.980 --> 16:55.620]  So, tough
[16:55.620 --> 16:57.580]  call, but I think I'm gonna go with
[16:57.580 --> 16:59.460]  a classic from childhood
[16:59.460 --> 17:01.700]  but everybody loves it. It's fun for the whole family.
[17:02.040 --> 17:03.220]  Home Alone, right?
[17:03.520 --> 17:05.820]  Kevin McCallister. Stuck home alone
[17:05.820 --> 17:07.540]  defending his homestead against
[17:07.540 --> 17:09.560]  the wet bandits. Eventually the sticky
[17:09.560 --> 17:10.800]  bandits from the second movie.
[17:12.340 --> 17:13.600]  It's just one of those fun
[17:13.600 --> 17:15.440]  movies. It feels like Christmas even though it's like
[17:15.440 --> 17:17.500]  it doesn't have like that
[17:18.320 --> 17:19.280]  Christmassy like
[17:19.280 --> 17:21.640]  tinge like oh, here we're focusing on
[17:21.640 --> 17:23.440]  Santa, that kind of thing, right? We're focusing
[17:23.440 --> 17:25.580]  on the time that it's happening around it.
[17:25.580 --> 17:27.680]  And it's just such a blast.
[17:27.800 --> 17:29.700]  I love it. And it still holds up to me
[17:29.700 --> 17:31.700]  even though as a parent now I'm
[17:31.700 --> 17:32.320]  like, how?
[17:33.460 --> 17:35.520]  How? How? How?
[17:35.980 --> 17:37.580]  How? The counting system does not
[17:37.580 --> 17:39.800]  work. Counting system doesn't work. And also
[17:40.320 --> 17:41.600]  thank God for cell phones now,
[17:41.660 --> 17:43.740]  right? So, my pick is Home Alone.
[17:44.460 --> 17:45.660]  That was my number two.
[17:45.740 --> 17:48.000]  That was in my top two. I think Christmas, Vacation
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.980]  and Home Alone are without a doubt the one-two.
[17:50.560 --> 17:51.700]  Well, Geoff, as a
[17:51.700 --> 17:53.800]  snake draft, you get
[17:53.800 --> 17:56.040]  two picks. Oh, right,
[17:56.140 --> 17:57.820]  right. I'm in fifth place and first place.
[17:58.320 --> 17:59.720]  So we're not gonna... okay, okay.
[17:59.720 --> 18:01.920]  Sounds good. Alright, well
[18:01.920 --> 18:03.840]  you know, obviously with every
[18:03.840 --> 18:05.740]  Christmas movie in existence to choose
[18:05.740 --> 18:07.700]  from, there's a lot of different directions you could go.
[18:07.960 --> 18:09.680]  I initially thought maybe I'd go like
[18:09.680 --> 18:11.660]  really old school and go like It's a Wonderful
[18:11.660 --> 18:13.520]  Life or Miracle on 34th Street
[18:13.520 --> 18:15.740]  or maybe something from my childhood, like
[18:15.740 --> 18:17.780]  a Christmas story. But I decided to go
[18:17.780 --> 18:19.700]  with my heart and where I am as an
[18:19.700 --> 18:21.860]  adult right now at 48 years old
[18:21.860 --> 18:23.800]  and what I enjoy. And so I'm going
[18:23.800 --> 18:26.000]  with a newer movie. I don't know if you guys are familiar
[18:26.000 --> 18:27.920]  with it or not. I hope
[18:27.920 --> 18:30.140]  you are. Written by
[18:30.140 --> 18:32.120]  the country superstar
[18:32.120 --> 18:33.980]  Blake Shelton's mom.
[18:34.840 --> 18:35.760]  He actually
[18:35.760 --> 18:38.240]  wrote a song about it.
[18:38.740 --> 18:39.960]  It's a little
[18:39.960 --> 18:42.000]  movie, a little Hallmark movie called
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.160]  Time for You to Come Home for Christmas
[18:44.160 --> 18:45.180]  from 2019.
[18:46.060 --> 18:47.920]  I'm sure you remember it's about Catherine.
[18:48.060 --> 18:49.920]  She returns home after her husband dies
[18:49.920 --> 18:52.020]  and then she meets a veteran and he's on kind of a holiday
[18:52.020 --> 18:54.000]  journey himself. And then as Christmas nears
[18:54.000 --> 18:55.580]  they form a bond
[18:55.580 --> 18:57.460]  and maybe find a miracle.
[18:58.140 --> 18:59.440]  Have you ever heard of this movie, Gavin?
[18:59.580 --> 19:01.500]  No. No. I've never heard of it.
[19:02.700 --> 19:04.020]  You should definitely
[19:04.020 --> 19:05.780]  check it out. It's apparently the fifth
[19:05.780 --> 19:07.120]  best Christmas movie of all time.
[19:07.740 --> 19:08.500]  I think...
[19:10.760 --> 19:11.860]  I think I might know
[19:11.860 --> 19:14.180]  what the sixth pick might be as well.
[19:14.740 --> 19:15.980]  Oh, right. Is it time for me to go
[19:15.980 --> 19:17.300]  next? Yeah. Oh, absolutely.
[19:17.300 --> 19:18.740]  Whenever you're ready.
[19:19.120 --> 19:20.940]  So, way
[19:20.940 --> 19:22.360]  back in round one,
[19:23.180 --> 19:25.340]  I feel
[19:25.340 --> 19:27.160]  like I zagged. I think I maybe caught you guys
[19:27.160 --> 19:29.240]  off guard by throwing out a movie that you
[19:29.240 --> 19:30.700]  guys hadn't seen before.
[19:31.300 --> 19:33.140]  You guys don't know this, but I'm a big
[19:33.680 --> 19:35.400]  Hallmark Christmas movie fan.
[19:35.960 --> 19:37.280]  My wife does
[19:37.280 --> 19:38.660]  not like that about me.
[19:39.120 --> 19:41.000]  She wants to watch Christmas Vacation.
[19:41.340 --> 19:43.120]  And I've seen all those
[19:43.120 --> 19:45.260]  movies one billion times, so I want to see
[19:45.260 --> 19:47.240]  new stuff that I haven't seen before. Which is how
[19:47.240 --> 19:49.280]  I came across Time for You to Come
[19:49.280 --> 19:51.140]  Home for Christmas, the 2019 classic
[19:51.140 --> 19:53.380]  that was written by Blake Shelton's mom. I think I mentioned
[19:53.380 --> 19:55.000]  that way back in round one.
[19:55.660 --> 19:57.260]  So for round two, I'm gonna
[19:57.260 --> 19:59.220]  continue to follow my heart. I'm gonna go with the
[19:59.220 --> 20:01.040]  2020 Hallmark classic
[20:01.040 --> 20:03.220]  Time for Us to Come
[20:03.220 --> 20:03.960]  Home for Christmas.
[20:05.400 --> 20:06.620]  So he's just gonna go.
[20:07.300 --> 20:09.520]  What I appreciate about Geoff is that
[20:09.520 --> 20:11.460]  he wants to watch new things.
[20:11.800 --> 20:13.240]  So he watches the
[20:13.240 --> 20:15.060]  same movie with a different title
[20:15.060 --> 20:17.400]  over and over again, which is what the Hallmark movies
[20:17.400 --> 20:19.320]  are. No, no, it's not the same movie.
[20:19.480 --> 20:20.940]  It's a spiritual successor.
[20:21.340 --> 20:23.340]  And if I'm not wrong, I believe
[20:23.340 --> 20:25.400]  it's based on a different Blake Shelton
[20:25.400 --> 20:26.780]  song. And
[20:26.780 --> 20:29.080]  this one has some
[20:29.080 --> 20:31.160]  fucking heavy hitters in it. It's got
[20:31.160 --> 20:33.180]  I'm sure everybody remembers Lacey
[20:33.180 --> 20:35.220]  Schabert from Party of Five. She's
[20:35.220 --> 20:37.400]  in it. Lacey Chabert? Yeah, there you go.
[20:39.400 --> 20:41.160]  Stephen Hussar, the original
[20:41.160 --> 20:43.220]  Meg. That's right. Yeah, there
[20:43.220 --> 20:45.460]  you go. So, you know,
[20:45.460 --> 20:47.400]  it's a very different story.
[20:48.020 --> 20:49.200]  It's about five guests
[20:49.200 --> 20:49.840]  that get
[20:51.320 --> 20:53.000]  mysteriously invited to an inn to celebrate
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.100]  Christmas with the help of the owner, Ben.
[20:55.320 --> 20:57.260]  Sarah discovers that an event from the past
[20:57.260 --> 20:58.640]  connects them and changes all their lives.
[20:58.940 --> 21:00.980]  Forever, dude. Forever?
[21:01.360 --> 21:03.280]  That's totally different from the previous movie,
[21:03.340 --> 21:05.220]  which was about a widow meeting
[21:05.220 --> 21:07.320]  a soldier, and then they form a bond.
[21:08.220 --> 21:09.160]  You could do it
[21:09.160 --> 21:11.000]  nine times in a row. I think I will laugh
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.780]  every time someone says, everyone
[21:12.780 --> 21:14.860]  remembers, and then they say the name wrong.
[21:15.060 --> 21:16.600]  That's the funniest thing.
[21:19.280 --> 21:20.580]  That was great.
[21:21.240 --> 21:22.600]  Much like your picks, Geoff.
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.040]  Great picks.
[21:24.840 --> 21:26.440]  Gavin, you're next. No, it's
[21:27.140 --> 21:28.100]  Nick. Oh, hello.
[21:29.140 --> 21:30.780]  This is a tough call because I
[21:30.780 --> 21:33.020]  feel like there's a couple I could go
[21:33.020 --> 21:34.660]  with that you may not pick, so
[21:34.660 --> 21:36.940]  I'm gonna take a risk, and I'm gonna move
[21:36.940 --> 21:38.400]  this one up in my draft pick.
[21:39.340 --> 21:40.980]  The Muppet Christmas Carol,
[21:41.200 --> 21:42.820]  one of my favorite
[21:42.820 --> 21:44.760]  kids' movies, and it's still
[21:45.360 --> 21:46.940]  so good. I just watched it
[21:46.940 --> 21:48.300]  and my son saw it for the first time.
[21:48.580 --> 21:50.760]  It's such a fun movie. You've got
[21:50.760 --> 21:52.780]  Gonzo, who's playing an omniscient Charles
[21:52.780 --> 21:54.900]  Dickens character in it, and Rizzo's just along
[21:54.900 --> 21:56.360]  for the ride, getting in trouble and
[21:56.940 --> 21:58.980]  having a bad time. All the little rats working
[21:58.980 --> 22:00.740]  for Scrooge, and Michael Caine
[22:00.740 --> 22:02.560]  is Scrooge. It's so good.
[22:02.600 --> 22:04.480]  My name is Epidisa.
[22:09.440 --> 22:10.400]  Please spare me.
[22:10.400 --> 22:10.920]  God damn it, Nick.
[22:11.000 --> 22:12.280]  You got my 2 and 3.
[22:12.440 --> 22:15.000]  Oh no! I guess 4 wasn't
[22:15.000 --> 22:16.700]  so bad, and...
[22:16.700 --> 22:18.160]  No, that was...
[22:18.160 --> 22:19.760]  Yeah, get him, Nick, get him!
[22:19.980 --> 22:23.080]  I could not have predicted a double Hallmark on the end
[22:23.080 --> 22:25.320]  and a fucking Die Hard
[22:25.320 --> 22:26.760]  and Love Actually in the first round.
[22:28.180 --> 22:29.080]  Well, then let me
[22:29.080 --> 22:30.560]  get to something a little more conventional.
[22:31.260 --> 22:32.980]  I like that Andrew starts all these
[22:32.980 --> 22:35.140]  drafts with, like, a mental
[22:35.140 --> 22:36.700]  plan for how it should go.
[22:36.900 --> 22:38.940]  With 4 other people, and is then
[22:39.380 --> 22:40.660]  surprised every time.
[22:40.900 --> 22:43.160]  Whoa! That's not what I would
[22:43.160 --> 22:45.020]  have picked. No, this is what I've learned.
[22:45.320 --> 22:47.120]  I have assumed every time that we
[22:47.120 --> 22:49.100]  all have the same board, and I
[22:49.100 --> 22:51.180]  now, going into the next draft,
[22:51.300 --> 22:52.920]  I will think about what picks
[22:52.920 --> 22:55.020]  you all will make. I just, I
[22:55.020 --> 22:57.140]  really appreciate that you think we all have a
[22:57.140 --> 22:58.880]  board. Yeah. I do?
[22:58.960 --> 23:00.080]  You don't have a list of 20?
[23:04.240 --> 23:05.120]  No! 20?!
[23:05.120 --> 23:06.160]  11 picked, I think?
[23:06.740 --> 23:09.020]  Yeah, I got like 6. I got one for every scenario,
[23:09.160 --> 23:10.860]  just in case. I already lost one.
[23:11.240 --> 23:13.000]  Yeah, there you go. No, I lost 2, actually.
[23:13.080 --> 23:15.020]  I've lost 2. Okay, well, let's see
[23:15.020 --> 23:17.180]  how this one does. From 1965,
[23:18.640 --> 23:19.140]  I'm gonna go
[23:19.140 --> 23:21.300]  with a Charlie Brown
[23:21.300 --> 23:22.840]  Christmas. Oh, good pick!
[23:23.480 --> 23:24.920]  Knew you were gonna pick that.
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.160]  Of course, of course. I love it.
[23:27.380 --> 23:29.080]  It is short, but I think
[23:29.080 --> 23:30.480]  for kids, that's great.
[23:30.960 --> 23:32.880]  I really appreciate the message.
[23:32.880 --> 23:34.600]  Charlie Brown with the little tree,
[23:34.840 --> 23:36.640]  and he's gonna do this thing in Snoopy's doghouse,
[23:36.700 --> 23:38.660]  and they take all the stuff down. I also appreciate
[23:38.660 --> 23:41.040]  for some reason, it's a very
[23:41.040 --> 23:42.500]  Christ-heavy message
[23:43.460 --> 23:43.940]  in
[23:45.100 --> 23:46.400]  the Peanuts gang.
[23:46.820 --> 23:48.300]  Very, very Christ-heavy.
[23:48.840 --> 23:50.860]  And you're not expecting it, and it always
[23:50.860 --> 23:52.880]  makes me laugh. But it's fun,
[23:53.200 --> 23:55.060]  Snoopy plays, a big guitar,
[23:55.380 --> 23:56.900]  and dances around, so it's really
[23:56.900 --> 23:58.400]  kind of got something for everyone.
[23:58.740 --> 23:59.980]  Charlie Brown Christmas is
[23:59.980 --> 24:01.620]  very high on my list.
[24:02.280 --> 24:03.980]  One of the all-time great, bad
[24:03.980 --> 24:05.960]  Christmas trees. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[24:06.500 --> 24:07.940]  Oh, yeah. I mean, it's like
[24:07.940 --> 24:10.040]  the bad Christmas tree that all bad Christmas trees
[24:10.040 --> 24:12.340]  are based on now, right? And judged by.
[24:12.880 --> 24:13.100]  Yep.
[24:13.680 --> 24:15.060]  So next up is Andrew.
[24:15.720 --> 24:17.800]  Oh, man, this is tough.
[24:17.880 --> 24:19.200]  So I have some personal picks.
[24:20.040 --> 24:21.840]  I'm trying to decide between my 6
[24:21.840 --> 24:23.060]  and my 7 right now.
[24:23.620 --> 24:26.100]  I think something else will fall to me.
[24:26.420 --> 24:28.120]  I'm gonna go with, and it's
[24:28.120 --> 24:29.800]  not the original,
[24:30.320 --> 24:31.420]  Home Alone 2.
[24:31.940 --> 24:33.300]  Great movie. Oh, damn it!
[24:34.360 --> 24:36.320]  Fantastic film. The perfect sequel.
[24:36.700 --> 24:38.260]  It's a perfect sequel.
[24:38.500 --> 24:40.140]  I missed out on the first one,
[24:40.200 --> 24:41.880]  but I at least get the second one. I get some
[24:41.880 --> 24:44.220]  Home Alone in my catalog. Great movie.
[24:45.360 --> 24:45.840]  Continuation.
[24:46.520 --> 24:47.960]  I mean, who would have ever thought a sequel
[24:47.960 --> 24:49.960]  would exist? Nick talking about, as a parent,
[24:50.280 --> 24:51.760]  it being crazy the first time it happens.
[24:52.040 --> 24:54.120]  Imagine it happened twice. Who could have guessed?
[24:54.440 --> 24:56.100]  Who could have guessed? He's lost
[24:56.100 --> 24:58.140]  in New York. And that in the first one
[24:58.140 --> 25:00.260]  there was a scary old man
[25:00.260 --> 25:02.160]  who they thought was a murderer who helped him.
[25:02.240 --> 25:04.120]  And then in the second one, there's a scary old
[25:04.120 --> 25:06.140]  bird lady who they think is, I don't know,
[25:06.180 --> 25:08.020]  eating birds or whatever, who helps him. I thought
[25:08.020 --> 25:10.700]  you were gonna make a Trump joke, but you zagged it.
[25:10.720 --> 25:12.000]  Oh, I forgot about that!
[25:12.600 --> 25:14.040]  How do you forget about that? It's the only
[25:14.040 --> 25:15.740]  thing that I think of when I think of this movie now.
[25:16.020 --> 25:17.980]  Really? Oh, I think about Tim Curry.
[25:18.120 --> 25:19.940]  Trump is in that movie talking about
[25:19.940 --> 25:21.980]  the president. He is!
[25:23.340 --> 25:24.320]  Well, an old president,
[25:24.320 --> 25:26.060]  but still. The president of the United
[25:26.060 --> 25:26.800]  States.
[25:28.420 --> 25:30.420]  Remember the Talkboy? I had one of those.
[25:30.680 --> 25:32.220]  Oh, me too! Yeah, I was about to say,
[25:32.280 --> 25:34.440]  that's like the number one toy of that year.
[25:35.400 --> 25:36.320]  That's why I forgot about
[25:36.320 --> 25:37.340]  Trump. I had one of those.
[25:38.220 --> 25:40.040]  Every time I watch the Homologues,
[25:40.520 --> 25:42.400]  I think Uncle Frank is just
[25:42.400 --> 25:44.340]  the biggest bastard. And every time you
[25:44.340 --> 25:46.100]  watch it, he's just so much worse.
[25:47.340 --> 25:48.240]  He fucking sucks.
[25:49.060 --> 25:50.360]  Who is the character that plays
[25:50.360 --> 25:52.340]  Uncle Frank? You looked that up. Oh, I
[25:52.340 --> 25:54.680]  asked Nick. Did the Talkboy, you think, influence
[25:54.680 --> 25:56.540]  your wanting to be an audio guy
[25:56.540 --> 25:57.540]  after that performance?
[25:57.800 --> 26:00.080]  Your interest in sound?
[26:00.820 --> 26:02.460]  Kevin McAllister, damn you!
[26:02.820 --> 26:04.380]  No. Yeah, maybe. It could have been.
[26:04.920 --> 26:06.100]  That's how I got here.
[26:06.720 --> 26:08.280]  Nick just practices booking
[26:08.280 --> 26:09.480]  rooms at the Plaza Hotel.
[26:11.680 --> 26:12.180]  Hello,
[26:12.420 --> 26:12.620]  sir.
[26:14.360 --> 26:15.580]  Here's my credit card.
[26:16.260 --> 26:17.720]  It's the perfect sequel because
[26:18.800 --> 26:20.160]  once you get over the
[26:20.160 --> 26:22.020]  stupid coincidence of them all being
[26:22.020 --> 26:24.140]  back in the same movie, it's just
[26:24.140 --> 26:26.200]  the characters have the perfect amount
[26:26.200 --> 26:27.500]  of memory of the first movie.
[26:27.880 --> 26:30.020]  Like, ducking the pot,
[26:30.100 --> 26:32.220]  the paint tins, and then
[26:32.220 --> 26:34.340]  getting rammed in the face. It's just so good.
[26:34.520 --> 26:36.120]  So well done. The hits
[26:36.120 --> 26:37.820]  are... there's no
[26:37.820 --> 26:39.240]  better moment
[26:39.980 --> 26:41.640]  in the history of film,
[26:41.920 --> 26:44.100]  I think, than when...
[26:44.100 --> 26:45.480]  the crowbar scene, right?
[26:45.740 --> 26:48.280]  When he's swinging at the spider and he hits him in the chest with a crowbar.
[26:48.280 --> 26:50.200]  Like, that single moment in
[26:50.200 --> 26:52.100]  Home Alone 1 is maybe the strongest
[26:52.640 --> 26:54.540]  piece of cinema we have.
[26:54.960 --> 26:56.500]  But, on a whole,
[26:56.680 --> 26:58.420]  I feel like all of the hits
[26:58.420 --> 27:00.460]  in 2 are better and elevated.
[27:00.680 --> 27:02.300]  If that makes sense. Aside from that one
[27:02.300 --> 27:04.360]  smack. All the stuff Kevin
[27:04.360 --> 27:06.280]  does to them in 2 is even better than the shit
[27:06.280 --> 27:08.360]  they do in 1, which is hard to accomplish.
[27:08.940 --> 27:10.160]  And the way that the
[27:10.160 --> 27:12.380]  giant tool chest rolls down
[27:12.380 --> 27:13.840]  the stairs without tipping over.
[27:14.340 --> 27:16.900]  It's just so stupid and funny to me.
[27:16.900 --> 27:18.760]  That was the sound of a giant
[27:18.760 --> 27:20.860]  tool chest rolling down the stairs.
[27:25.780 --> 27:26.300]  Gavin,
[27:26.940 --> 27:28.920]  because you're number 1, you get the
[27:28.920 --> 27:31.060]  next 2 picks as we sneak draft this thing.
[27:31.720 --> 27:32.360]  Well, to me,
[27:32.700 --> 27:33.980]  nothing says Christmas
[27:34.640 --> 27:36.880]  like Sinbad. Fuck!
[27:37.560 --> 27:38.620]  Jingle all the way, baby!
[27:39.120 --> 27:41.040]  Jingle all the goddamn way!
[27:41.300 --> 27:42.840]  That is such a good film.
[27:42.960 --> 27:44.420]  I was hoping it would fall to me.
[27:44.420 --> 27:46.100]  Such a good film.
[27:46.340 --> 27:47.940]  It's so weird
[27:48.540 --> 27:49.820]  It's so weird
[27:50.340 --> 27:52.360]  when it gets near the end and they're
[27:52.360 --> 27:53.280]  in a big parade.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.360]  And for some reason the suit is
[27:56.360 --> 27:57.560]  like a
[27:58.400 --> 28:00.320]  half a billion dollar tech suit
[28:00.320 --> 28:01.440]  for no reason.
[28:02.320 --> 28:04.520]  Like he could actually fly.
[28:05.140 --> 28:06.100]  Very weird.
[28:06.520 --> 28:07.820]  Very, very weird.
[28:09.200 --> 28:10.300]  That's where that movie
[28:10.300 --> 28:12.080]  really falls off for me, where I just go
[28:12.080 --> 28:14.160]  I only remember the parts
[28:14.160 --> 28:15.840]  from the big parade
[28:15.840 --> 28:17.840]  and not the rest of the movie.
[28:18.140 --> 28:20.020]  And that's unfortunate because the rest of the movie
[28:20.020 --> 28:21.400]  is way better than the big parade.
[28:21.520 --> 28:23.580]  And it's a classic story of like
[28:23.580 --> 28:24.880]  shitball father
[28:25.480 --> 28:28.240]  gets redemption through just a bunch of
[28:28.240 --> 28:30.400]  luck. And it doesn't really learn anything.
[28:31.180 --> 28:32.200]  Shitball father?
[28:33.360 --> 28:34.420]  Shitball father.
[28:34.680 --> 28:35.540]  There's a
[28:36.240 --> 28:37.700]  bomb in that movie.
[28:37.780 --> 28:40.080]  There's like a legitimate postal bomb.
[28:40.080 --> 28:41.520]  There's a drunk reindeer.
[28:41.820 --> 28:44.120]  Arnold Schwarzenegger fights a bunch of mall
[28:44.120 --> 28:46.100]  Santas. It's fucking crazy.
[28:46.260 --> 28:48.140]  And as a kid, having the
[28:48.140 --> 28:50.020]  Turboman toy made it even better.
[28:50.340 --> 28:52.200]  You had a Turboman? Dude, you had a
[28:52.200 --> 28:54.060]  Turboman? I had a real Turboman.
[28:54.460 --> 28:55.880]  I wish I still had it.
[28:55.940 --> 28:57.480]  They made a bunch of them for the movie.
[28:57.860 --> 28:59.480]  I had one. It was great.
[28:59.820 --> 29:02.160]  Jake Lloyd was a legend as a kid
[29:02.160 --> 29:03.980]  between Phantom Menace and that.
[29:04.180 --> 29:06.160]  Yeah, it is him. He had an insane
[29:06.160 --> 29:07.840]  two movie run where if you were
[29:07.840 --> 29:09.880]  a kid around my age, Jake Lloyd
[29:09.880 --> 29:11.120]  was the fucking man.
[29:12.380 --> 29:13.620]  Two movie run.
[29:14.480 --> 29:15.740]  Oh, they're huge movies.
[29:15.880 --> 29:17.820]  Jingle all the way and the Phantom Menace?
[29:18.220 --> 29:19.220]  Fucking massive.
[29:19.660 --> 29:21.920]  I wonder what the best two movie and then
[29:21.920 --> 29:23.640]  only two movie run is.
[29:23.840 --> 29:24.540]  Jake Lloyd.
[29:25.120 --> 29:28.020]  There was that kid from Jerry Maguire.
[29:28.260 --> 29:29.360]  What was that kid's name? You remember him?
[29:29.760 --> 29:30.860]  Jonathan Lipnicki.
[29:31.200 --> 29:33.780]  He was in that and then he was in a movie called
[29:33.780 --> 29:35.900]  The Littlest Vampire and then you never saw him
[29:35.900 --> 29:37.960]  again. Oh no, don't disrespect
[29:37.960 --> 29:39.620]  like Mike in that way.
[29:39.880 --> 29:41.620]  Oh, I've never seen it. Oh, that's right.
[29:41.860 --> 29:43.020]  He is like Mike.
[29:43.480 --> 29:45.460]  He's not like Mike. He's like Mike's friend.
[29:45.820 --> 29:47.380]  He goes, wow, that guy's like Mike.
[29:47.940 --> 29:49.580]  Oh, well there you go.
[29:50.120 --> 29:52.020]  Well, Gavin, Jingle
[29:52.020 --> 29:53.120]  all the Way, I think was
[29:53.120 --> 29:55.480]  an overwhelmingly positive pick.
[29:55.860 --> 29:57.000]  But you get another one.
[29:57.500 --> 29:58.060]  That's true.
[29:59.320 --> 30:01.260]  And this one is for all of the
[30:02.060 --> 30:03.600]  British millennials who
[30:03.600 --> 30:05.700]  I assume had this on VHS.
[30:06.120 --> 30:07.520]  It was a little TV movie
[30:07.520 --> 30:09.720]  short, animated, called
[30:09.720 --> 30:10.680]  The Snowman.
[30:11.800 --> 30:13.540]  Frosty the Snowman? Nope.
[30:14.560 --> 30:15.780]  Just the Snowman.
[30:15.840 --> 30:17.980]  The Snowman? Just the Snowman.
[30:18.260 --> 30:19.860]  Isn't that a Michael Fassbender
[30:19.860 --> 30:20.200]  movie?
[30:21.040 --> 30:24.080]  Hello, Mr. Policeman.
[30:24.580 --> 30:25.280]  Wasn't he about a
[30:25.280 --> 30:27.600]  serial killer? Yeah, isn't this a serial
[30:27.600 --> 30:29.720]  killer movie where like they literally ran out
[30:29.720 --> 30:31.640]  of money and they couldn't... Yeah, they would hide
[30:31.640 --> 30:33.580]  the bodies in the snowmen? Oh,
[30:33.620 --> 30:35.280]  it's this fucking thing.
[30:35.680 --> 30:37.660]  Oh, have you seen that, Eric? Have you seen The Snowman?
[30:37.900 --> 30:39.740]  I haven't seen... I just know...
[30:39.740 --> 30:41.620]  Is it like a book? Oh, yeah,
[30:41.660 --> 30:43.180]  it is. I think it was also a book
[30:43.180 --> 30:45.260]  and the kids like flying around
[30:45.260 --> 30:47.300]  the countryside of England singing
[30:47.300 --> 30:49.680]  I'm Walking in the Air and all that. I hate
[30:49.680 --> 30:51.840]  the way it looks so much.
[30:52.180 --> 30:54.060]  It's so soft.
[30:54.280 --> 30:55.620]  It's got an animation style
[30:55.620 --> 30:57.680]  that if you haven't slept
[30:57.680 --> 30:59.400]  well will give you a real freaking headache.
[30:59.400 --> 31:01.360]  Oh my God, it hurts. No!
[31:01.800 --> 31:03.080]  I don't like it.
[31:03.220 --> 31:05.380]  But obviously an absolute pillar
[31:05.380 --> 31:07.520]  of my childhood and many of my
[31:08.260 --> 31:09.400]  well, generation.
[31:09.580 --> 31:11.480]  Oh, yeah, I had this book as
[31:11.480 --> 31:13.440]  a kid. I didn't know there was a short
[31:13.920 --> 31:14.640]  meanie. Well, that's cool.
[31:15.200 --> 31:17.420]  I think it has David Bowie in it.
[31:17.860 --> 31:19.240]  What? Nice.
[31:21.320 --> 31:22.820]  Oh, and there was also like a
[31:23.180 --> 31:25.540]  there was also like another short in the same animation style
[31:25.540 --> 31:26.800]  about Santa and
[31:26.800 --> 31:28.880]  he sang a song called
[31:28.880 --> 31:30.940]  Another Bloomin' Christmas and I used to think
[31:30.940 --> 31:32.700]  that was so funny when I was about four
[31:32.700 --> 31:34.780]  that he called it, that he was saying Bloomin'
[31:35.580 --> 31:36.920]  because it sounded like a swear
[31:36.920 --> 31:37.720]  but it wasn't.
[31:38.620 --> 31:40.940]  Would you say this was like a
[31:41.480 --> 31:42.740]  always on at Christmas
[31:42.740 --> 31:44.920]  a big classic, everybody knew it, kind of like Charlie Brown
[31:45.540 --> 31:46.480]  but for England? Yeah. Okay.
[31:46.900 --> 31:48.820]  Cool. Big time. Interesting.
[31:49.080 --> 31:51.020]  Oh, good pick. That's a uniquely
[31:51.020 --> 31:52.040]  you pick. That's pretty good.
[31:52.820 --> 31:54.760]  It's so funny if you Google the
[31:54.760 --> 31:56.560]  snowman, the images are
[31:56.560 --> 31:58.440]  Michael Fassbender in a
[31:58.440 --> 32:00.700]  like looking down a thing of
[32:00.700 --> 32:02.700]  blood covered snow with a
[32:02.700 --> 32:04.500]  gun in his hand and also
[32:04.500 --> 32:06.760]  just like the most family friendly snowman
[32:06.760 --> 32:08.620]  it's a mix between both. It's great.
[32:10.380 --> 32:12.480]  Andrew, you get the next pick.
[32:14.520 --> 32:16.560]  Man, okay. So this
[32:16.560 --> 32:18.660]  this is a complicated pick because
[32:18.660 --> 32:21.060]  I think in a vacuum
[32:21.060 --> 32:22.300]  of itself
[32:22.300 --> 32:24.000]  it's fantastic
[32:24.000 --> 32:26.300]  it's a really great Christmas movie
[32:26.300 --> 32:28.380]  but it was
[32:28.380 --> 32:30.440]  overplayed and it has hurt it a
[32:30.440 --> 32:32.000]  lot. I feel like most people
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.400]  sick of it now, largely due
[32:34.400 --> 32:36.320]  to the fact that TBS had nothing else
[32:36.320 --> 32:38.420]  to do. I'm going with a
[32:38.420 --> 32:39.400]  Christmas story
[32:39.400 --> 32:42.020]  I think it's like so
[32:42.900 --> 32:44.460]  overplayed but that is not
[32:44.460 --> 32:45.780]  the fault of the film.
[32:46.200 --> 32:48.420]  If you remove it from that context, there's so many
[32:48.420 --> 32:50.120]  things that I think are so funny about it.
[32:50.120 --> 32:52.100]  Discovering it as a kid, I
[32:52.100 --> 32:54.060]  thought it was hilarious. I still
[32:54.060 --> 32:56.300]  laugh at Fragile, he must be Italian
[32:56.300 --> 32:57.860]  Honey it's as fragile
[32:57.860 --> 32:59.960]  when he's trying to open the box that he won.
[33:00.060 --> 33:01.820]  I think that's such a great dumb gag.
[33:02.660 --> 33:04.040]  So many iconic
[33:04.040 --> 33:06.440]  images. It's almost like it is so
[33:06.960 --> 33:08.080]  perfect for the
[33:08.080 --> 33:10.320]  season that it has hurt it because
[33:10.320 --> 33:12.180]  like TBS used to do those 24 hour
[33:12.180 --> 33:14.140]  marathons. But I think it's an all time
[33:14.140 --> 33:16.200]  great Christmas movie, just overplayed.
[33:16.240 --> 33:17.180]  But that's not its fault.
[33:17.180 --> 33:18.600]  No, I get that.
[33:18.780 --> 33:19.960]  I think that's strong
[33:21.020 --> 33:23.200]  because I agree. I wouldn't put it on
[33:23.200 --> 33:25.180]  my list for all the reasons you listed
[33:25.680 --> 33:27.340]  why it's not the film's fault.
[33:27.540 --> 33:28.740]  I agree it's not the film's fault.
[33:29.020 --> 33:31.560]  I just wouldn't put it on my list because of those reasons.
[33:33.420 --> 33:33.860]  Unfortunately.
[33:34.720 --> 33:35.980]  But I think it's a good pick.
[33:38.040 --> 33:38.920]  My pick
[33:38.920 --> 33:41.080]  I think this is unconventional but I do
[33:41.680 --> 33:43.140]  watch it around Christmas time
[33:43.140 --> 33:45.160]  and it is a Christmas movie
[33:45.160 --> 33:46.620]  because it's written by Shane Black.
[33:46.900 --> 33:49.200]  It's Lethal Weapon, which is a movie
[33:49.200 --> 33:50.920]  that opens with Jingle Bell Rock
[33:50.920 --> 33:53.140]  I think, as she's
[33:53.140 --> 33:54.860]  really high and then falls off the balcony.
[33:54.980 --> 33:57.080]  It opens with her taking a gainer
[33:57.080 --> 33:58.560]  off the top of a hotel.
[33:58.820 --> 34:01.000]  And the song that's playing in the background, I think, maybe it's
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.020]  Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree. It's one of the two.
[34:03.660 --> 34:04.980]  And Christmas
[34:04.980 --> 34:06.960]  is the background theme and I think
[34:06.960 --> 34:09.220]  sort of the theme of Mel Gibson's character, like part
[34:09.220 --> 34:10.060]  of it. And
[34:10.980 --> 34:12.980]  also, I found out when I was
[34:12.980 --> 34:14.840]  making my list, that the house
[34:14.840 --> 34:16.940]  that Danny Glover lives in, in that movie
[34:16.940 --> 34:18.620]  is the same house that
[34:19.520 --> 34:20.920]  like the yuppie couple
[34:20.920 --> 34:22.840]  like Julia Louis-Dreyfus from
[34:22.840 --> 34:24.280]  Christmas Vacation lives in. Oh wow.
[34:24.640 --> 34:27.040]  Oh really? That's wild. It is the same
[34:27.040 --> 34:28.500]  house. The house that takes the ice?
[34:28.940 --> 34:29.600]  Yeah, when
[34:30.460 --> 34:33.020]  how are you going to fit that tree in there? Bend over and I'll show
[34:33.020 --> 34:33.660]  you. Like that part?
[34:35.940 --> 34:36.820]  That house
[34:36.820 --> 34:38.860]  is the same house that Danny Glover lives in.
[34:38.960 --> 34:41.000]  Dude, and Gary Busey
[34:41.000 --> 34:42.800]  a pre-motorcycle accident
[34:42.800 --> 34:44.860]  Gary Busey is very
[34:45.520 --> 34:47.440]  very scary in that movie.
[34:47.720 --> 34:48.200]  Awesome.
[34:48.680 --> 34:50.380]  Mr. Joshua, right? Yup.
[34:51.060 --> 34:52.740]  God, I love it. I love it.
[34:52.840 --> 34:54.520]  It's so good. So Lethal Weapon's my pick.
[34:54.920 --> 34:56.760]  If you haven't watched it during Christmas, give it a shot.
[34:56.940 --> 34:58.540]  It's more Christmassy than you remember.
[34:59.040 --> 35:00.900]  Also, like watch any of Shane Black's
[35:00.900 --> 35:02.420]  movies during Christmas. They all
[35:02.960 --> 35:04.880]  are... I was curious which Shane Black
[35:04.880 --> 35:06.500]  would make this list. Oh yeah.
[35:06.860 --> 35:08.700]  There's more Shane Black
[35:08.700 --> 35:10.740]  that I could have put on this list, but I decided
[35:10.740 --> 35:12.080]  to keep it to one.
[35:13.180 --> 35:14.040]  Because there's a lot.
[35:15.520 --> 35:16.780]  But Nick, you're next.
[35:17.140 --> 35:18.700]  Funny you should mention Shane Black.
[35:18.860 --> 35:20.760]  I had this, and this is the one I actually
[35:20.760 --> 35:22.800]  dropped because I love this movie, but I didn't
[35:22.800 --> 35:24.640]  think anyone would pick it in that round.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.200]  So, I'm going with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.
[35:27.300 --> 35:28.660]  Yes, that was on my list.
[35:28.880 --> 35:30.460]  Shane Black movie, I love it.
[35:30.560 --> 35:31.780]  Robert Downey Jr. is incredible.
[35:32.140 --> 35:33.440]  Val Kilmer is hilarious.
[35:35.580 --> 35:36.780]  It's kind of a murder mystery
[35:36.780 --> 35:38.020]  movie. Michelle Monaghan's in it too.
[35:38.680 --> 35:40.540]  Is it comedy? Yes.
[35:40.940 --> 35:41.500]  Dark comedy.
[35:42.420 --> 35:45.120]  Definite comedy. Sort of like a...
[35:45.120 --> 35:46.500]  It's trying to be like a little
[35:46.500 --> 35:48.680]  noir-y, but it is...
[35:48.680 --> 35:50.720]  It's funny, and it is
[35:50.720 --> 35:52.660]  Christmas, and it is...
[35:52.660 --> 35:54.140]  It's very Shane Black.
[35:54.400 --> 35:56.480]  I think if you liked any of his other stuff, you'd enjoy it.
[35:56.660 --> 35:58.620]  Yeah, Robert Downey Jr. plays like a thief who
[35:58.620 --> 36:00.580]  kind of... he wanders into
[36:00.580 --> 36:02.840]  like a test...
[36:02.840 --> 36:04.720]  like an audition for a
[36:04.720 --> 36:06.620]  role, and he is pretending
[36:06.620 --> 36:08.840]  to hide in there, and they like his performance
[36:08.840 --> 36:10.600]  so much that he's getting hired for the role.
[36:10.720 --> 36:12.640]  And he's sent out to Hollywood, essentially, to learn
[36:12.640 --> 36:14.560]  under Val Kilmer's private eye,
[36:14.660 --> 36:16.620]  who's like this super serious
[36:16.620 --> 36:18.760]  dude who thinks he's an idiot
[36:18.760 --> 36:20.520]  and just treats him like shit the whole movie.
[36:20.600 --> 36:21.700]  It's very, very good.
[36:22.120 --> 36:24.960]  He plays a petty thief who is trying to steal
[36:24.960 --> 36:26.500]  a knock-off RoboCop
[36:26.500 --> 36:28.240]  for Christmas, and
[36:28.240 --> 36:30.720]  he runs into an audition to hide,
[36:31.220 --> 36:32.660]  and the thing he's reading
[36:32.660 --> 36:34.440]  for is exactly the scenario
[36:34.440 --> 36:36.500]  that just happened that got his friend shot.
[36:36.820 --> 36:38.640]  So he gives a really convincing performance,
[36:38.640 --> 36:40.600]  and they think he's an amazing actor
[36:40.600 --> 36:42.660]  when really, it's just his life has
[36:42.660 --> 36:44.600]  just happened. And he's reacting like
[36:44.600 --> 36:46.580]  a human would to that scenario.
[36:46.880 --> 36:48.240]  It's great. Very quotable.
[36:48.440 --> 36:49.760]  A lot of funny lines in it.
[36:50.100 --> 36:52.840]  The thing I always remember from that movie is
[36:52.840 --> 36:54.680]  Val Kilmer saying to Robert
[36:54.680 --> 36:56.560]  Downey Jr., do you know what would happen
[36:56.560 --> 36:58.540]  if I looked up idiot in the dictionary, and then
[36:58.540 --> 37:00.420]  Robert Downey Jr. saying you'd see a picture of me,
[37:00.420 --> 37:02.360]  and then he says no, I'd see the
[37:02.360 --> 37:04.380]  definition of an idiot, which you fucking are,
[37:04.440 --> 37:06.160]  and then he hits him in the head with a box.
[37:06.340 --> 37:07.260]  It's great.
[37:08.240 --> 37:09.060]  Excellent movie.
[37:10.520 --> 37:12.060]  It's good stuff, but Geoff!
[37:12.680 --> 37:13.720]  It's your pick now.
[37:14.040 --> 37:16.640]  You actually get two. You get your last two picks in a row.
[37:17.060 --> 37:18.000]  Oh, that's exciting.
[37:18.040 --> 37:18.860]  I wonder what's going to happen.
[37:19.840 --> 37:22.400]  Is that why the shots say time for them
[37:22.400 --> 37:23.120]  to come home?
[37:24.600 --> 37:26.040]  Gavin, don't spoil it!
[37:26.400 --> 37:28.460]  Time for me to come home!
[37:29.640 --> 37:30.640]  Honey, I shrunk
[37:30.640 --> 37:31.160]  the Christmas!
[37:31.900 --> 37:34.420]  When I approached this, I wanted to...
[37:34.420 --> 37:36.480]  I like a traditional Christmas story. I think the first
[37:36.480 --> 37:38.380]  one in the series that I talked about earlier, the Blake
[37:38.380 --> 37:40.460]  Shelton one, was definitely a traditional
[37:40.460 --> 37:42.660]  Christmas story. The next one was kind of a mystery,
[37:43.060 --> 37:44.460]  which I like. This one
[37:44.460 --> 37:46.520]  is even a little bit more off the beaten path.
[37:46.580 --> 37:48.240]  This is about a woman who gets pulled
[37:48.240 --> 37:50.540]  from a car in the ice.
[37:50.820 --> 37:52.420]  She goes off the road and she's
[37:52.420 --> 37:54.020]  rescued from the icy waters
[37:54.780 --> 37:56.460]  and comes out with amnesia
[37:56.460 --> 37:57.540]  and then she
[37:58.680 --> 38:00.480]  essentially gets a ride with a handsome
[38:00.480 --> 38:02.480]  nurse to try to figure out
[38:02.480 --> 38:04.560]  who she is and find out the clues to her
[38:04.560 --> 38:05.820]  identity while also
[38:06.460 --> 38:08.500]  bringing some positivity and light and joy to
[38:08.500 --> 38:10.400]  the world. This is time for them to come home
[38:10.400 --> 38:12.380]  for Christmas, the 2020
[38:13.200 --> 38:14.160]  Hallmark Classic.
[38:14.440 --> 38:15.660]  I'm sure you all remember it.
[38:16.440 --> 38:18.220]  Oh my god.
[38:19.940 --> 38:20.500]  Of course.
[38:21.480 --> 38:21.720]  Yeah.
[38:22.220 --> 38:22.420]  Yeah.
[38:22.420 --> 38:23.040]  Yeah.
[38:24.480 --> 38:26.540]  I don't know why I didn't consider
[38:26.540 --> 38:26.840]  that.
[38:28.600 --> 38:29.560]  Great pick.
[38:30.240 --> 38:32.520]  And what I like is that they're also different.
[38:33.280 --> 38:33.540]  Yeah.
[38:34.020 --> 38:34.380]  Right.
[38:35.860 --> 38:38.260]  I mean, they kind of spiritually
[38:38.260 --> 38:40.460]  exist in the same universe, but they're not directly
[38:40.460 --> 38:42.000]  tied to each other in any way.
[38:42.240 --> 38:43.940]  Before we recorded,
[38:44.320 --> 38:46.440]  Geoff said that with these drafts, he typically
[38:46.440 --> 38:48.440]  does something that's very amusing to him
[38:48.440 --> 38:50.520]  and maybe nobody else. And he was just
[38:50.520 --> 38:52.080]  randomly snickering.
[38:52.340 --> 38:54.300]  And we were trying to figure out what it was.
[38:54.500 --> 38:56.580]  And it makes me so happy that this
[38:56.580 --> 38:58.520]  is... I thought maybe you'd go all
[38:58.520 --> 39:00.360]  Hallmark. I could have never predicted
[39:00.360 --> 39:02.300]  this. No, this is pretty
[39:02.300 --> 39:04.680]  exciting. I was so sure that that wouldn't
[39:04.680 --> 39:06.480]  be the title that I guessed out loud
[39:06.480 --> 39:07.260]  and now I feel bad.
[39:10.040 --> 39:12.180]  No, I think it's so much better that you did.
[39:12.300 --> 39:13.520]  Is it time for my last pick?
[39:13.980 --> 39:15.480]  It's definitely time for your last pick.
[39:15.620 --> 39:17.720]  I'm going super recent with this one.
[39:18.240 --> 39:19.460]  This one was last
[39:19.460 --> 39:21.400]  year, so 2022, so it's probably fresh
[39:21.400 --> 39:22.460]  in all of your minds.
[39:23.220 --> 39:25.140]  I think everybody remembers
[39:25.720 --> 39:27.280]  it was directed by the great
[39:27.280 --> 39:29.420]  David Winning, written by Marcy Holland.
[39:30.100 --> 39:31.580]  Four days before Christmas,
[39:31.920 --> 39:33.380]  Elizabeth received a voicemail from
[39:33.380 --> 39:35.100]  an unknown number. She didn't recognize it.
[39:35.320 --> 39:36.940]  And in the message, it was a man's voice
[39:36.940 --> 39:39.260]  who she doesn't know. And he makes a plea to
[39:39.260 --> 39:40.780]  the love of his life for a second chance.
[39:41.060 --> 39:42.920]  She has to figure out what's going on.
[39:43.300 --> 39:45.060]  It's the Hallmark Classic.
[39:45.060 --> 39:47.480]  Time for him to come home for Christmas.
[39:47.480 --> 39:47.740]  Cool.
[39:49.260 --> 39:49.660]  Great.
[39:54.100 --> 39:55.020]  That's my last pick.
[39:55.400 --> 39:56.740]  Just out of curiosity,
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  and I won't judge you negatively for this,
[39:59.140 --> 40:00.620]  but have you seen these movies?
[40:02.720 --> 40:04.460]  Of course, I wouldn't pick them if I hadn't.
[40:04.620 --> 40:06.860]  Of course, he says.
[40:07.380 --> 40:08.640]  I want to tell you what I haven't seen
[40:08.640 --> 40:10.660]  that comes out this year, though. I haven't seen
[40:10.660 --> 40:12.500]  Time for Her to Come Home for Christmas yet.
[40:12.500 --> 40:14.660]  Maybe a little bit of viewing
[40:14.660 --> 40:16.740]  for us. Maybe something to do.
[40:17.020 --> 40:18.540]  Is that Time for Dog to Come Home
[40:18.540 --> 40:19.020]  for Christmas?
[40:20.240 --> 40:21.280]  Not yet.
[40:22.280 --> 40:23.600]  It's an Air Bud sequel.
[40:25.060 --> 40:25.960]  Well, Geoff
[40:26.320 --> 40:27.980]  has rounded out his four picks.
[40:28.400 --> 40:30.460]  That was the most fun I've
[40:30.460 --> 40:30.960]  ever had.
[40:32.980 --> 40:34.560]  But now it's
[40:34.560 --> 40:35.320]  time for Nick.
[40:35.920 --> 40:37.940]  It's time for Nick to make his last pick.
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.360]  There's so many possibilities
[40:40.360 --> 40:42.300]  for this last pick. There's so many open,
[40:42.440 --> 40:44.180]  and there's so many good Christmas movies out there still.
[40:44.340 --> 40:46.060]  But I think I have to go with the one that...
[40:46.060 --> 40:48.260]  I actually didn't see this the first ten years it was out.
[40:48.400 --> 40:50.220]  It took until I met my wife to actually see this.
[40:50.400 --> 40:51.620]  I'm going to go with Elf.
[40:51.820 --> 40:53.360]  I knew it was going to be Elf.
[40:53.460 --> 40:55.120]  Oh, I forgot that movie existed.
[40:55.600 --> 40:58.160]  It's one that I also forget about sometimes,
[40:58.260 --> 41:00.260]  and if you have a chance, you should watch the
[41:00.260 --> 41:02.240]  Netflix show, the movies that
[41:02.240 --> 41:04.340]  made us, and watch the episode about it, because how it got
[41:04.340 --> 41:06.480]  created is really cool to see, and how they were like,
[41:06.720 --> 41:07.780]  we're hoping it's Will Ferrell.
[41:07.780 --> 41:09.520]  You know, so...
[41:09.520 --> 41:10.900]  It's a cool story there.
[41:11.140 --> 41:13.740]  Got a pre-suicide attempt to Artie Lang in it, too.
[41:14.380 --> 41:15.720]  Yeah, yes. Oh, does it?
[41:16.040 --> 41:17.780]  Yeah, he played Santa Claus. He played the mall Santa.
[41:17.900 --> 41:18.520]  That's right!
[41:19.840 --> 41:21.260]  Man, he was on a little roll there.
[41:21.920 --> 41:24.020]  He was. He was on a huge fucking roll.
[41:24.140 --> 41:25.580]  Yeah, he was doing a really great job.
[41:25.660 --> 41:27.540]  He was getting a lot of rolls. He was making a lot of money.
[41:27.620 --> 41:29.220]  He was doing a lot of work, and then
[41:29.880 --> 41:31.860]  something happened. Who could have seen
[41:31.860 --> 41:33.560]  it coming? Yeah, no clue.
[41:33.780 --> 41:34.820]  Still trying to figure it out.
[41:34.820 --> 41:36.840]  We're really a blind side.
[41:37.780 --> 41:38.620]  Oh, God.
[41:39.980 --> 41:40.800]  Anyway, Elf.
[41:41.040 --> 41:42.420]  He eats a lot of sweet shit.
[41:43.120 --> 41:43.340]  Yeah.
[41:44.300 --> 41:46.660]  And it has a Blansoy de Janelle. Enjoy!
[41:47.880 --> 41:48.620]  Merry Christmas.
[41:49.120 --> 41:50.860]  Great movie. It's a movie that's so
[41:50.860 --> 41:52.820]  recent for me that I don't have a lot of love
[41:52.820 --> 41:54.820]  for it, but I do...
[41:56.040 --> 41:56.380]  I like it.
[41:56.680 --> 41:57.960]  I think Elf is a good pick.
[41:58.340 --> 41:59.160]  My pick
[42:00.500 --> 42:01.560]  is a classic.
[42:02.440 --> 42:03.300]  Oh, no.
[42:03.880 --> 42:05.500]  It's How the Grinch Stole Christmas.
[42:05.780 --> 42:06.100]  Oh!
[42:06.740 --> 42:09.900]  Yes, the animated one.
[42:09.900 --> 42:10.920]  The original animated one.
[42:10.960 --> 42:12.960]  Because all the other ones are bad.
[42:13.280 --> 42:15.520]  The original 1967. I love it.
[42:15.680 --> 42:17.760]  His little dog is great. His little dog
[42:17.760 --> 42:19.560]  with the horn. He's got a little antler.
[42:19.960 --> 42:21.280]  He doesn't want to be a part of the thing.
[42:22.560 --> 42:23.020]  Again,
[42:23.260 --> 42:25.440]  it's a Chuck Jones thing, which I think is so
[42:25.440 --> 42:27.000]  good, because it's Chuck Jones.
[42:27.500 --> 42:29.580]  But reading up
[42:29.580 --> 42:31.400]  on it and everything, when you read about
[42:31.400 --> 42:33.400]  what the movie's about
[42:33.400 --> 42:35.580]  and all this stuff, it lists the dog
[42:35.580 --> 42:37.500]  as the second antagonist, and
[42:37.500 --> 42:39.500]  I think that's the funniest way that you
[42:39.500 --> 42:41.520]  could think of that
[42:41.520 --> 42:43.380]  character in this movie.
[42:43.680 --> 42:45.420]  The second antagonist.
[42:47.040 --> 42:47.120]  But,
[42:47.480 --> 42:49.500]  How the Grinch Stole Christmas, the original animated.
[42:49.680 --> 42:51.640]  Again, a short one, but I really love it.
[42:52.320 --> 42:53.540]  That's fantastic. I was
[42:53.540 --> 42:55.580]  a little bit nervous when you said classic.
[42:56.040 --> 42:57.720]  Because I feel like mine is also
[42:57.720 --> 42:59.620]  a classic and obscure. I've been
[42:59.620 --> 43:01.880]  waiting on this one. My pick.
[43:02.320 --> 43:03.740]  Because I think it's obscure.
[43:03.940 --> 43:05.620]  Definite classic. It was
[43:05.620 --> 43:07.220]  something I grew up watching a lot.
[43:07.660 --> 43:09.140]  I watched a lot of my grandpa.
[43:10.580 --> 43:11.700]  Fantastic music.
[43:12.000 --> 43:12.880]  Great puppetry.
[43:13.520 --> 43:15.500]  I am going with Emmett Otter's
[43:15.500 --> 43:17.600]  Jugman Christmas. One of my
[43:17.600 --> 43:19.100]  favorite Christmas movies.
[43:19.640 --> 43:20.920]  It's a Jim Henson
[43:21.720 --> 43:23.500]  film. It's a production. I think it was
[43:23.500 --> 43:24.940]  originally maybe a TV special.
[43:25.920 --> 43:27.120]  Great, great
[43:27.120 --> 43:28.960]  iconic Muppets type score.
[43:29.900 --> 43:31.080]  You're closer now
[43:31.080 --> 43:32.940]  than ever before. That song.
[43:33.200 --> 43:34.920]  It's a story about Emmett
[43:34.920 --> 43:36.500]  Otter and his mom.
[43:36.880 --> 43:39.000]  Who live in poverty. And they both
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.500]  decide to enter
[43:40.500 --> 43:42.980]  a talent show to try to win
[43:42.980 --> 43:44.280]  money for their family.
[43:44.880 --> 43:46.980]  And they have to go against a rock
[43:46.980 --> 43:48.760]  band that I'm blanking the name of.
[43:48.860 --> 43:51.100]  They're like the... what are they called?
[43:51.840 --> 43:52.900]  They're like the Nightmare.
[43:52.900 --> 43:54.040]  The Nightmare. Yeah.
[43:55.460 --> 43:56.780]  It's great. And they're called the
[43:56.780 --> 43:57.820]  Riverbottom Gang.
[43:59.360 --> 44:00.000]  Riverbottom Gang.
[44:00.740 --> 44:01.880]  So much great music.
[44:02.480 --> 44:04.540]  Really touching story. Really well done.
[44:04.640 --> 44:06.680]  Funny. I'd highly recommend it. I'm picking it
[44:06.680 --> 44:08.980]  because it is a part of my childhood
[44:08.980 --> 44:10.720]  as well as hopefully people will watch it.
[44:10.860 --> 44:13.200]  It's great. Oh, it's also got Kermit in it.
[44:13.480 --> 44:13.860]  Oh wow!
[44:14.120 --> 44:16.980]  He does the intro to it. It has a hilarious
[44:16.980 --> 44:18.360]  blooper reel. Surprisingly.
[44:19.200 --> 44:20.420]  That you can find on YouTube.
[44:20.420 --> 44:22.160]  So at the very least, I would recommend
[44:22.160 --> 44:24.220]  watching the bloopers for Emmet Otter's
[44:24.220 --> 44:26.460]  Jugband Christmas. Dude, I've never even heard of that movie.
[44:26.520 --> 44:28.000]  That's awesome. Thank you. It's great.
[44:28.220 --> 44:30.460]  Gavin, are you gonna check out the blooper reel for Emmet Otter's Jugband
[44:30.460 --> 44:32.620]  Christmas? I don't see why not.
[44:33.700 --> 44:34.260]  That's great.
[44:35.620 --> 44:36.480]  But now that we
[44:36.480 --> 44:37.960]  have all the other picks done,
[44:38.400 --> 44:40.300]  it's time for Gavin's
[44:40.300 --> 44:42.000]  final pick to round out this list.
[44:42.740 --> 44:44.340]  Well, I'll be honest. There's some great
[44:44.340 --> 44:46.060]  stuff still left on the table here.
[44:46.360 --> 44:48.160]  Punts. There's so much.
[44:48.160 --> 44:50.140]  This is even still a hard pick.
[44:50.960 --> 44:52.360]  But I'm gonna go with
[44:53.180 --> 44:54.020]  Angels With
[44:54.020 --> 44:55.300]  Even Filthier Souls.
[44:55.800 --> 44:57.360]  Oh, that's funny.
[44:58.640 --> 44:59.740]  That's funny.
[45:00.120 --> 45:02.160]  The movie from Inside Home Alone
[45:02.160 --> 45:03.800]  because Home Alone 1 and 2 were taken.
[45:03.940 --> 45:06.040]  I think the first Home Alone had a movie called
[45:06.040 --> 45:07.380]  Angels With Filthier Souls.
[45:07.940 --> 45:10.020]  But it wasn't a Christmas movie.
[45:10.160 --> 45:12.400]  In the second one, it's the Christmas version of that
[45:12.400 --> 45:14.220]  called Angels With
[45:14.220 --> 45:16.240]  Even Filthier Souls where the guy says
[45:16.240 --> 45:18.020]  Merry Christmas, you
[45:18.020 --> 45:18.800]  filthy animals.
[45:20.060 --> 45:21.180]  That's awesome.
[45:22.220 --> 45:23.720]  And we've done it.
[45:23.920 --> 45:25.560]  We've picked the greatest
[45:26.240 --> 45:27.820]  holiday movies of all time.
[45:28.220 --> 45:30.120]  Here's Gavin's pick as he was number one
[45:30.120 --> 45:31.580]  and picked the number one slot.
[45:32.520 --> 45:34.060]  Die Hard, Jingle All The Way,
[45:34.160 --> 45:35.540]  The Snowman, and Angels With
[45:36.200 --> 45:37.440]  Even Filthier Souls.
[45:38.580 --> 45:40.020]  Andrew, number two
[45:40.020 --> 45:41.940]  and picked the number two slot. Christmas
[45:41.940 --> 45:44.120]  Vacation, Home Alone 2 Lost In New York,
[45:44.120 --> 45:46.080]  A Christmas Story, and Emmet Otter's
[45:46.080 --> 45:47.980]  Jug Band Christmas.
[45:48.780 --> 45:50.060]  I got number three
[45:50.060 --> 45:51.840]  in the draft order and picked the number three slot.
[45:52.060 --> 45:54.040]  Love Actually, A Charlie Brown Christmas, Lethal
[45:54.040 --> 45:55.360]  Weapon, and How The Grinch Stole Christmas.
[45:56.040 --> 45:58.300]  Nick got fourth and picked the fourth slot.
[45:59.040 --> 45:59.680]  Home Alone,
[46:00.200 --> 46:02.100]  Muppet Christmas Carol, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,
[46:02.380 --> 46:04.260]  and Elf and Geoff rounding it out
[46:04.260 --> 46:04.920]  at the bottom.
[46:05.840 --> 46:07.560]  Time for you to come home for Christmas.
[46:07.760 --> 46:09.220]  Time for us to come home for Christmas.
[46:09.480 --> 46:10.960]  Time for them to come home for Christmas.
[46:10.960 --> 46:12.820]  Time for him to come home for Christmas.
[46:13.160 --> 46:15.200]  And those are all of the
[46:15.200 --> 46:16.860]  holiday movies that you will ever
[46:16.860 --> 46:18.340]  need. Are there
[46:18.860 --> 46:21.000]  any movies that didn't make the cut that y'all are
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.660]  sad about? Like, for instance, I Was Bummed,
[46:22.900 --> 46:25.100]  Four Christmases, and Christmas With The Cranks
[46:25.100 --> 46:26.900]  didn't make it. I Was Bummed, that
[46:26.900 --> 46:28.960]  after all the Shane Black stuff, that
[46:28.960 --> 46:30.700]  Long Kiss Goodnight didn't come out.
[46:31.060 --> 46:32.500]  Oh, that's a
[46:32.500 --> 46:33.540]  good movie.
[46:34.620 --> 46:37.020]  Iron Man 3, I think, could
[46:37.020 --> 46:39.040]  have been on the list, but
[46:39.040 --> 46:40.900]  it wasn't. Nobody picked
[46:40.900 --> 46:42.780]  Nightmare Before Christmas? No, but
[46:42.780 --> 46:44.820]  that's a Halloween movie. Nobody picked
[46:44.820 --> 46:46.480]  It's A Wonderful Life. Oh, yeah.
[46:47.020 --> 46:48.900]  Yeah, it's classic. I only found out
[46:48.900 --> 46:50.860]  about this recently. Do you know
[46:50.860 --> 46:52.840]  the only reason that that got so
[46:52.840 --> 46:54.900]  popular is that they lapsed on the
[46:54.900 --> 46:56.740]  rights? Somebody didn't file the
[46:57.420 --> 46:59.000]  trademark or like the claim
[46:59.000 --> 47:00.880]  on it, so it became free
[47:00.880 --> 47:03.060]  for TV to show
[47:03.060 --> 47:04.940]  and that's why it was shown every Christmas?
[47:05.560 --> 47:06.960]  It was a box office bomb.
[47:07.740 --> 47:08.820]  I'm pretty sure
[47:08.820 --> 47:10.260]  Geoff did that with Achievement Hunter.
[47:11.640 --> 47:12.720]  Way to go, Geoff!
[47:14.000 --> 47:15.100]  I made Achievement Hunter
[47:15.100 --> 47:15.980]  a box office bomb?
[47:18.960 --> 47:20.920]  Nobody picked Gremlins. Nobody picked
[47:20.920 --> 47:23.040]  Scrooged. Scrooged
[47:23.040 --> 47:24.620]  is a great one. I had
[47:24.620 --> 47:26.940]  Frosty the Snowman, Polar Express,
[47:27.620 --> 47:28.660]  Arthur Christmas,
[47:30.140 --> 47:31.020]  Bad Santa.
[47:31.860 --> 47:32.980]  I'd say those are kind
[47:32.980 --> 47:33.580]  of the bigger ones.
[47:34.120 --> 47:35.520]  Can I put in for
[47:35.520 --> 47:36.180]  some
[47:37.860 --> 47:38.720]  shit pic?
[47:38.940 --> 47:41.600]  A film that I think is just so
[47:41.600 --> 47:43.620]  bad but I don't know why people like it?
[47:43.740 --> 47:43.980]  Sure.
[47:45.340 --> 47:47.700]  There are two really dogshit
[47:47.700 --> 47:49.820]  Christmas movies. One is The Santa Claus.
[47:50.260 --> 47:51.320]  I think it's a piece of shit.
[47:51.660 --> 47:53.640]  The second one, The Holiday.
[47:54.460 --> 47:55.620]  Everyone I know seems
[47:55.620 --> 47:57.460]  to really like that film and it is an
[47:57.460 --> 47:59.380]  absolute stinker.
[47:59.680 --> 48:01.260]  I don't know what's good about it.
[48:01.260 --> 48:02.720]  I don't get it either.
[48:02.900 --> 48:05.260]  I like Jude Law but I don't even think he's doing anything
[48:05.260 --> 48:06.600]  in that movie that's worth writing about.
[48:06.600 --> 48:08.580]  I don't really mind any of the people in it.
[48:08.660 --> 48:11.300]  It's just dogshit story
[48:11.300 --> 48:13.260]  and kind of dogshit performances all around.
[48:13.440 --> 48:15.060]  That replaced TPG for
[48:15.060 --> 48:16.280]  Love Actually.
[48:16.920 --> 48:18.520]  It did. I was about to say.
[48:18.880 --> 48:20.040]  That's in his top three.
[48:20.340 --> 48:22.680]  He bloody loves it.
[48:23.020 --> 48:24.140]  I don't think I've ever even heard of it.
[48:25.280 --> 48:26.740]  It has Jack Black in it.
[48:27.100 --> 48:29.540]  It's Jack Black, Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz,
[48:29.540 --> 48:30.620]  Jude Law.
[48:31.700 --> 48:33.500]  I walked out as a teenager.
[48:34.060 --> 48:35.980]  I went in and it was what it was
[48:35.980 --> 48:37.420]  and I was not in the mood for it
[48:37.420 --> 48:38.040]  so I just left it.
[48:38.040 --> 48:40.040]  Why would you watch that as a teenager?
[48:40.340 --> 48:43.940]  I'm pretty sure the score is Hans Zimmer.
[48:44.700 --> 48:45.140]  Yeah it is.
[48:45.880 --> 48:48.240]  On paper it's excellent.
[48:49.060 --> 48:49.600]  How weird.
[48:50.140 --> 48:51.140]  It's just not a good movie though.
[48:51.540 --> 48:53.220]  Do you guys remember the movie Jack Frost?
[48:53.340 --> 48:54.760]  Not the one with Michael Keaton?
[48:55.160 --> 48:56.800]  Yes, the horror one.
[48:56.800 --> 48:57.740]  The horror movie?
[48:58.200 --> 49:01.000]  Where he takes off his nose.
[49:01.180 --> 49:01.880]  Yeah and he goes
[49:02.500 --> 49:03.820]  Fucker's a snowman!
[49:06.400 --> 49:08.300]  I watched that at my friend Matt's house.
[49:08.760 --> 49:10.960]  What was the Joseph Gordon Levitt
[49:10.960 --> 49:12.200]  Seth Rogen one?
[49:13.740 --> 49:14.660]  The night before?
[49:15.160 --> 49:16.120]  The night before.
[49:17.520 --> 49:19.020]  It's a movie that came out
[49:19.020 --> 49:20.980]  and they were like this is going to be the new holiday thing
[49:20.980 --> 49:22.200]  and nobody saw it.
[49:22.460 --> 49:25.060]  I put that movie and Office Christmas Party on
[49:25.060 --> 49:27.140]  a couple of times and I can't tell you one second
[49:27.140 --> 49:27.920]  of either of those films.
[49:28.640 --> 49:29.800]  It just immediately
[49:31.320 --> 49:32.620]  turned into background noise.
[49:33.060 --> 49:34.760]  Okay so are we
[49:34.760 --> 49:36.900]  ready to wrap this up then and move on to
[49:36.900 --> 49:37.580]  Christmas songs?
[49:37.900 --> 49:40.660]  Let us know in the comments
[49:40.660 --> 49:41.320]  which
[49:42.620 --> 49:45.360]  who you'd go with. Who had the strongest list?
[49:46.040 --> 49:47.140]  Is it time for
[49:47.140 --> 49:49.260]  you to make a choice and leave a comment?
[49:49.940 --> 49:51.100]  Or time for us
[49:51.100 --> 49:52.480]  to make a choice and leave a comment?
[49:52.480 --> 49:54.640]  Or time for them to make a
[49:54.640 --> 49:55.600]  choice and leave a comment?
[49:56.040 --> 49:58.320]  Or simply time for him to make a choice

[50:11.900 --> 50:14.560]  It's so funny that Geoff was on the end so we got all of his
[50:14.560 --> 50:15.560]  in packs of two.
[50:20.060 --> 50:21.080]  It's really good.
[50:21.320 --> 50:22.300]  It's really good.
[50:22.720 --> 50:23.800]  I had a lot of fun.
[50:23.820 --> 50:25.260]  Okay, anything else?
[50:25.400 --> 50:27.620]  Any parting holiday words for the people at home?
[50:28.160 --> 50:28.460]  A.
[50:29.460 --> 50:31.680]  Have a good one. Happy holidays.
[50:33.560 --> 50:34.300]  She said it
[50:34.300 --> 50:35.840]  like it was pre-recorded.
[50:36.800 --> 50:37.980]  What you didn't know
[50:37.980 --> 50:39.520]  about that is that's actually a quote
[50:39.520 --> 50:41.500]  from Time for Us to Come Home for Christmas.
[50:41.760 --> 50:43.120]  You guys, yeah, I'm dropping
[50:43.120 --> 50:45.080]  If you guys had seen the movie, you'd be laughing
[50:45.080 --> 50:46.640]  your dicks off right now.
[50:47.240 --> 50:49.020]  No, I just have trouble with sincerity.
[50:49.180 --> 50:50.000]  You know that.
[50:51.160 --> 50:53.060]  I wanted it to sound real but I can't.
[50:53.620 --> 50:54.900]  I just don't know how to do it.
[50:55.580 --> 50:57.720]  I feel like we all struggle with that on this podcast.
[50:59.940 --> 51:01.000]  Remember Andrew being
[51:01.000 --> 51:01.880]  excited for your wedding?
[51:02.300 --> 51:04.260]  I'm very excited about that wedding.
[51:06.200 --> 51:09.120]  I couldn't be more pumped
[51:09.120 --> 51:09.960]  about this wedding.
[51:09.960 --> 51:12.660]  Y'all hear
[51:12.660 --> 51:14.260]  they're going to have burgers at the wedding?
[51:14.640 --> 51:16.220]  Fucking crazy.
[51:19.920 --> 51:21.700]  Alright, happy holidays. Bye.
[51:21.840 --> 51:22.160]  Bye.
