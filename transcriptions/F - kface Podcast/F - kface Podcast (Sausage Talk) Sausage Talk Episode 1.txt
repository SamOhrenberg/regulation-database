[00:14.920 --> 00:16.740]  I mean, are you going to do, like, a big introduction?
[00:17.620 --> 00:20.940]  Hey now, we're on Office Talk! Here we go, episode one!
[00:22.640 --> 00:23.900]  I guess that's a yes.
[00:25.220 --> 00:29.020]  I started off as, like, half-crazy frog, straight into...
[00:31.600 --> 00:35.380]  So, I'm going to prep. This is supplemental content, right? Out the bat. This is not...
[00:35.380 --> 00:39.660]  This is... it's content adjacent, right? I guess it's canonical, but this is not the
[00:39.660 --> 00:39.980]  main content.
[00:39.980 --> 00:41.060]  This worries me greatly.
[00:41.260 --> 00:41.880]  Well, what do you mean?
[00:42.020 --> 00:46.800]  We're all here, the same cast as f***face, not making f***face.
[00:46.960 --> 00:47.180]  Yeah.
[00:47.240 --> 00:47.700]  This is not f***face.
[00:47.700 --> 00:49.180]  We have to somehow not make it.
[00:49.420 --> 00:50.100]  We're not...
[00:50.100 --> 00:53.740]  I don't... yeah, I don't see how that works. I think we're just going to make f***face.
[00:53.880 --> 00:56.220]  No! We didn't make f***face when we did the Apple review!
[00:56.940 --> 00:57.560]  We kind of did.
[00:57.600 --> 01:02.160]  But that was a very pointed, different thing. I don't... I mean, I can't see the whiteboard,
[01:02.320 --> 01:03.940]  so maybe... maybe it is going to be different.
[01:03.940 --> 01:05.800]  Geoff told me it's not important for you to see the whiteboard.
[01:05.800 --> 01:07.080]  Alright, let's give Andrew the whiteboard.
[01:08.260 --> 01:12.340]  Geoff dragged the whiteboard from another conference room into this recording room.
[01:12.340 --> 01:14.280]  It took a long time. I recorded it. It was a whole thing.
[01:14.380 --> 01:17.060]  First off, I want to get into that, because actually I want to talk about the whiteboard
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.500]  situation real fast. But first, let me just say this. So we... I presented this idea
[01:23.500 --> 01:28.520]  to f***face a while ago, and that idea was we should have an office day where we come
[01:28.520 --> 01:31.800]  in once a month and we just like... we talk about the business, we talk about like what
[01:31.800 --> 01:34.960]  we want to achieve, maybe make some supplemental content, that kind of thing.
[01:35.120 --> 01:35.540]  It's a different brand.
[01:36.240 --> 01:36.960]  And uh...
[01:36.960 --> 01:37.140]  What?
[01:37.700 --> 01:38.540]  What's a different brand?
[01:39.440 --> 01:40.600]  What are you saying? Achieve?
[01:41.120 --> 01:41.480]  Achieve?
[01:42.400 --> 01:42.640]  What?
[01:43.460 --> 01:46.840]  I like that. It also could be up in the air for which business we're talking about, like
[01:47.640 --> 01:49.180]  talking roosterteeth, are we talking uniforms?
[01:49.380 --> 01:55.080]  No, we're talking... listen, we're here in... in this capacity, we are talking f***face,
[01:55.640 --> 01:59.300]  we are... which is a subsidiary of flukeface, which we don't talk about often, which is
[01:59.300 --> 02:00.180]  a subsidiary...
[02:00.180 --> 02:01.240]  It's more of a holding company.
[02:01.260 --> 02:04.920]  It's more of a holding company, which is a subsidiary of uniforms. So anything that falls
[02:04.920 --> 02:08.340]  in the purview of f***, fluke, or una, we're talking about.
[02:08.440 --> 02:09.180]  So I feel like this...
[02:09.180 --> 02:09.540]  Nothing else.
[02:09.720 --> 02:11.580]  This should be... this should be uniform.
[02:12.220 --> 02:12.660]  I guess so.
[02:12.700 --> 02:15.480]  I think supplementals should just fall under the uniform umbrella.
[02:15.760 --> 02:16.000]  Okay.
[02:16.340 --> 02:16.580]  Okay.
[02:16.680 --> 02:19.900]  Well, that's part of what we're here to determine, right? To work all this stuff out.
[02:19.900 --> 02:21.440]  So this is more of a uniform board meeting.
[02:21.700 --> 02:21.880]  Uniform...
[02:21.880 --> 02:25.900]  Oh, that's... okay, alright. So it's not so much office day, this is a uniform board meeting.
[02:26.460 --> 02:26.780]  So...
[02:26.780 --> 02:26.940]  Got it.
[02:28.040 --> 02:28.360]  Uh...
[02:28.900 --> 02:32.520]  I had... I presented this idea, I didn't think anybody would go for it. I definitely didn't
[02:32.520 --> 02:34.900]  think Gavin would go for it. But then everybody was like, oh, it's a great idea, we'll do
[02:34.900 --> 02:39.720]  it. And then you went and did it with your other productions, and it was highly successful.
[02:39.820 --> 02:44.160]  Oh, I stole it for Face Jam, and we started a new podcast, we went and ate stuff.
[02:44.260 --> 02:45.440]  And you're like, what's up with that?
[02:45.500 --> 02:46.020]  Here's my problem.
[02:46.020 --> 02:47.080]  Well, I had like a whole plan.
[02:47.720 --> 02:52.600]  Yeah, so what I did was I came in prepared, and then we achieved what we attempted to.
[02:52.600 --> 02:53.120]  That's another brand.
[02:53.700 --> 02:59.260]  Here's my... here's my problem with that. By doing that, which is great, I mean, ideas
[02:59.260 --> 03:01.920]  shouldn't exist in a vacuum, we should be able to share them.
[03:01.920 --> 03:05.000]  He's about to tell me why it should exist in a vacuum and why we shouldn't share it.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.680]  No, no, here's my problem with it, though. You've done it to great success.
[03:08.820 --> 03:08.940]  Yeah.
[03:09.060 --> 03:09.320]  Yes.
[03:09.340 --> 03:12.840]  You've taken our idea and done it to great success before we got to do our idea once,
[03:12.920 --> 03:17.160]  which is fine, except I feel like that puts an undue amount of pressure on us to at least
[03:17.160 --> 03:19.640]  perform as well as... what's that, Andrew?
[03:19.860 --> 03:20.180]  Disagree.
[03:20.480 --> 03:21.340]  I agree with you completely.
[03:21.540 --> 03:22.540]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[03:22.580 --> 03:22.600]  He raised the bar.
[03:22.780 --> 03:25.600]  He set the bar to a level that we might not be able to hit.
[03:25.700 --> 03:25.900]  Yeah.
[03:26.280 --> 03:26.480]  Yeah.
[03:26.520 --> 03:28.540]  I feel like we are now going to be measured...
[03:28.540 --> 03:28.860]  There's no bar.
[03:28.860 --> 03:33.680]  ...against the stick of the face jam Office Day, and if we don't hit three yards or however
[03:33.680 --> 03:35.760]  tall that stick is, then we've failed.
[03:35.920 --> 03:36.180]  It's a dinklage.
[03:36.700 --> 03:36.880]  A dinklage?
[03:36.900 --> 03:37.340]  I'm sorry.
[03:37.560 --> 03:38.680]  I shouldn't have been speaking in dinklages.
[03:39.200 --> 03:44.300]  It's... I don't... I'll be honest, coming into this, we had one thing planned...
[03:44.300 --> 03:44.500]  Yeah.
[03:44.620 --> 03:45.960]  ...and we didn't do it.
[03:46.040 --> 03:46.480]  What was that?
[03:46.780 --> 03:48.120]  You hitting baseballs?
[03:48.380 --> 03:53.180]  Oh, well, that... listen, the one thing we... that wasn't the reason we did this. That was
[03:53.180 --> 03:58.840]  a, hey, let's have Office Day, and then you go, it would be...
[03:58.840 --> 04:03.020]  You're going to say that you wanted to get stuff not on the weekends anymore, right?
[04:03.060 --> 04:07.900]  Yeah, yeah, and... but the idea for Office Day came before the idea of, like, hitting
[04:07.900 --> 04:12.000]  baseballs was thrown into Office Day, which would be the thing that we were planning to
[04:12.000 --> 04:12.860]  do on the Office Day.
[04:12.880 --> 04:14.640]  It was a thing we were planning to do on an Office Day.
[04:14.640 --> 04:15.700]  Right, and we didn't do it.
[04:15.820 --> 04:16.460]  Right, on this Office Day.
[04:16.460 --> 04:18.200]  Because Gavin's hurt, and I'm hurt.
[04:18.580 --> 04:20.420]  I mean, what am I doing hitting baseballs?
[04:20.760 --> 04:22.400]  You gotta dodge those balls, man.
[04:22.480 --> 04:23.480]  I'm dodging balls.
[04:23.820 --> 04:26.040]  I gotta do it on fucking ganny ankles.
[04:26.040 --> 04:28.280]  We have all those balls in my office, too.
[04:28.400 --> 04:29.100]  There are so many.
[04:29.240 --> 04:29.560]  So many balls.
[04:29.560 --> 04:30.540]  They are so heavy.
[04:30.660 --> 04:31.480]  Yeah, they're brutal.
[04:31.720 --> 04:31.860]  Yeah.
[04:31.980 --> 04:33.540]  I know, because I had to carry them.
[04:33.720 --> 04:33.860]  Yeah.
[04:34.980 --> 04:39.020]  But we couldn't hit the baseballs today, but that's fine, because Andrew is here.
[04:39.400 --> 04:40.760]  We also couldn't do MVP today.
[04:41.520 --> 04:43.500]  And that's unfortunate, and Andrew is here.
[04:43.600 --> 04:44.960]  Because the presentation's not ready.
[04:45.440 --> 04:47.460]  Yeah, it says, gotta get that present.
[04:47.540 --> 04:48.620]  You want the banana wipes?
[04:48.820 --> 04:49.340]  It's hard.
[04:49.460 --> 04:50.600]  There's not a standard wipe.
[04:50.740 --> 04:51.620]  Can I ask you this, Andrew?
[04:51.760 --> 04:54.640]  How much effort have you put in?
[04:54.660 --> 04:56.020]  Have you opened the document yet?
[04:57.240 --> 04:59.820]  Uh, I haven't opened the document yet.
[05:01.060 --> 05:02.020]  I have...
[05:02.020 --> 05:05.260]  I wish for a pregnant pause.
[05:05.360 --> 05:07.680]  I would have put so much money on that answer.
[05:09.120 --> 05:14.020]  I would say I've put 5% in, but that's a lot of...
[05:14.020 --> 05:15.900]  That's a core 5% that I've done.
[05:16.240 --> 05:17.860]  I've got the images in my head.
[05:17.920 --> 05:19.560]  I've got kind of the arc figured out.
[05:19.820 --> 05:21.880]  I haven't put the document in, but it's in the head.
[05:22.100 --> 05:23.120]  It's in my head right now.
[05:23.120 --> 05:23.700]  I can see it.
[05:23.700 --> 05:28.910]  The fucking...
[05:29.890 --> 05:33.050]  I wish you could see the image of Gavin's face.
[05:38.910 --> 05:40.450]  I mean, if it's gonna...
[05:40.450 --> 05:40.810]  You know what?
[05:40.930 --> 05:42.330]  I'm gonna make the talk right now.
[05:42.350 --> 05:43.810]  I'm gonna open it right now.
[05:43.950 --> 05:45.530]  So we're already at 10%.
[05:45.530 --> 05:46.550]  That's 6% now.
[05:49.430 --> 05:50.310]  Oh, man.
[05:51.510 --> 05:55.430]  So, I think what we'll do today, since we can't hit baseballs, is we'll film the
[05:55.430 --> 05:56.850]  SBI supplemental we talked about.
[05:56.890 --> 05:57.290]  Oh, that's good.
[05:57.390 --> 05:57.690]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:57.690 --> 05:58.370]  We'll record...
[05:58.370 --> 05:59.290]  Because I want to hear about...
[05:59.290 --> 06:02.830]  Gavin doesn't remember any of it, but I do want to hear about what you guys...
[06:02.830 --> 06:04.170]  Your experience with SBI.
[06:04.450 --> 06:07.050]  Yeah, I want to hear it, too, because I missed the last two days of recording.
[06:07.350 --> 06:10.390]  Andrew was talking to me about it last night, and I was already...
[06:10.390 --> 06:11.510]  Already stuff I'd forgotten.
[06:11.650 --> 06:12.510]  I was like, oh, yeah.
[06:12.630 --> 06:13.230]  Oh, that's good.
[06:13.390 --> 06:13.790]  That'll be good.
[06:13.890 --> 06:15.370]  It'll jog your memory, and that'll be...
[06:15.370 --> 06:16.710]  You and the audience will learn about it sometime.
[06:18.850 --> 06:22.910]  But while we were sitting waiting for Gavin to come in, you, Andrew, Geoff, and Eric were
[06:22.910 --> 06:26.210]  having conversations about, like, movies, and it was so funny, and I felt like we were
[06:26.210 --> 06:30.130]  burning material, that we decided we should record it, and then create a supplemental
[06:30.130 --> 06:33.290]  series called Office Talk, or maybe it's the Uniform Boardroom meeting.
[06:33.370 --> 06:34.090]  I really like that.
[06:34.130 --> 06:36.570]  However we choose to go with it, I like that idea, too.
[06:37.050 --> 06:41.590]  Anyway, I wrote a bunch of stuff down on the board for us to discuss, and we decided that
[06:41.590 --> 06:43.470]  this might be an opportunity to see...
[06:43.470 --> 06:46.190]  You know, to get the peer behind the veil, a little bit of seeing how the sausage is
[06:46.190 --> 06:49.430]  made, while not making f*** face.
[06:49.670 --> 06:49.950]  Right.
[06:50.070 --> 06:50.950]  We're not making the show right now.
[06:50.950 --> 06:51.870]  We're not making f*** face.
[06:51.870 --> 06:52.090]  Right.
[06:52.770 --> 06:55.770]  And if this is so f*** face, maybe we can't even release it.
[06:55.850 --> 06:56.150]  I don't know.
[06:56.990 --> 06:57.730]  I'm a little worried.
[06:57.930 --> 06:58.930]  If we make...
[06:58.930 --> 07:00.690]  If it's too close to f*** face, it can't come out?
[07:00.770 --> 07:02.030]  Then it has to just be an episode?
[07:02.370 --> 07:03.070]  Well, it can't be an episode.
[07:03.210 --> 07:03.730]  It can't be an episode.
[07:03.730 --> 07:03.870]  It can't be an episode.
[07:03.950 --> 07:04.850]  It's just 121.
[07:07.550 --> 07:09.590]  How many supplemental pieces have we made?
[07:10.310 --> 07:11.390]  We made, um...
[07:11.390 --> 07:12.650]  There's been a couple of Q&As.
[07:12.910 --> 07:14.390]  Yeah, there was a bit of Raymond Sommet.
[07:14.610 --> 07:15.870]  How many Q&As did you have, Andrew?
[07:16.370 --> 07:18.650]  I think I recorded three, two of them came out.
[07:18.970 --> 07:20.010]  Oh, the third one didn't come out?
[07:20.390 --> 07:20.930]  I don't think so, no.
[07:20.930 --> 07:21.810]  I can check on it.
[07:21.910 --> 07:22.550]  What is Raymond...
[07:22.550 --> 07:23.410]  What's the Raymond Sommet thing?
[07:24.230 --> 07:24.790]  When he...
[07:24.790 --> 07:26.530]  That was part of the Q&A, wasn't it?
[07:26.610 --> 07:26.690]  Yeah.
[07:26.950 --> 07:27.810]  No, no, that was...
[07:27.810 --> 07:28.990]  Oh, no, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:29.210 --> 07:30.190]  The two-minute one, yeah.
[07:30.390 --> 07:32.410]  There was the...
[07:32.410 --> 07:32.870]  Apples.
[07:33.050 --> 07:34.010]  The apple review.
[07:34.290 --> 07:34.570]  Tuxedo.
[07:34.870 --> 07:36.130]  The tuxedo watching.
[07:37.810 --> 07:39.510]  Andrew's tuxedo bidding.
[07:39.810 --> 07:40.430]  Oh, that's...
[07:40.430 --> 07:41.130]  F*** face.
[07:41.430 --> 07:42.410]  Oh, f*** face.
[07:44.010 --> 07:45.370]  That's seven right there.
[07:45.410 --> 07:46.150]  Yeah, it's...
[07:46.150 --> 07:46.990]  According to my math.
[07:47.070 --> 07:47.690]  That's a pretty good one.
[07:48.130 --> 07:48.590]  Finger math.
[07:48.770 --> 07:49.630]  Way to go, man.
[07:49.630 --> 07:50.410]  Yeah, I got it.
[07:50.990 --> 07:51.950]  I think that's it.
[07:52.230 --> 07:57.030]  Okay, so this is either the eighth piece of Supplemental content or episode 121.
[07:58.010 --> 07:58.650]  F***ing hell.
[08:00.050 --> 08:01.330]  What season is this?
[08:02.430 --> 08:03.670]  Of the Supplemental.
[08:04.150 --> 08:05.630]  Are we in season one of Supplemental?
[08:05.670 --> 08:06.570]  You guys made me mad.
[08:06.610 --> 08:07.430]  We don't do seasons anymore.
[08:07.950 --> 08:10.550]  So anyway, wrote a bunch of stuff down.
[08:10.650 --> 08:15.470]  Also, we wanted to do it in this room, but this room was occupied by another production briefly.
[08:15.710 --> 08:17.610]  So we started in the conference room.
[08:17.610 --> 08:24.470]  I wrote a bunch of thought starters down on the whiteboard, things we could talk about, dig into, mix it up on, that kind of thing.
[08:25.090 --> 08:31.630]  And then Eric was like, you should take a photo of that so you can bring it into the new room with me when we move.
[08:31.990 --> 08:34.090]  I looked at the whiteboard, it's got wheels.
[08:34.350 --> 08:35.950]  So I'm like, why don't we just take the whole whiteboard with us?
[08:35.970 --> 08:36.530]  That's not a problem.
[08:37.710 --> 08:45.150]  Walked out into the hallway with the whiteboard, ran into the STF crew, like John and Barbara and Blaine.
[08:45.150 --> 08:50.770]  And to a person, every one of them looked disappointed to see me.
[08:51.830 --> 08:52.770]  And they were...
[08:52.770 --> 08:53.730]  I think they were.
[08:54.310 --> 08:56.110]  Right, right, right.
[08:56.250 --> 08:58.090]  I even saw John, I was like, hey man, long time no see.
[08:58.110 --> 08:59.310]  And he's like, yeah, yeah.
[08:59.410 --> 09:01.550]  And then he goes, what's going on? You here a lot now?
[09:01.570 --> 09:02.130]  And I'm like, no, no, no.
[09:02.130 --> 09:05.990]  And he goes, he asked me, he's like, what are we doing in the office?
[09:06.090 --> 09:06.970]  Where's your office?
[09:07.070 --> 09:10.570]  It's not like he wanted to make sure I'm not office close to him.
[09:10.650 --> 09:12.190]  These people have moved into this building.
[09:12.290 --> 09:13.050]  They've moved back in.
[09:13.110 --> 09:14.350]  It's like the first people back in.
[09:14.350 --> 09:19.890]  And they've known peace for the past three weeks or whatever, month or two.
[09:20.810 --> 09:25.030]  And they walk out and they see you dragging the whiteboard out of their conference room.
[09:25.110 --> 09:29.110]  With me riding on the back, spilling water all over the floor.
[09:29.230 --> 09:30.790]  I'd try to grab my coffee in the other hand.
[09:31.190 --> 09:35.590]  All we were doing was taking a whiteboard from one conference room to another room.
[09:35.690 --> 09:36.930]  It's not the end of the world.
[09:37.410 --> 09:39.850]  They, they, they looked offended.
[09:40.170 --> 09:40.230]  Yeah.
[09:40.330 --> 09:41.830]  And it's not even, it's not even from their office.
[09:41.930 --> 09:44.250]  They have, I'm sure they have their own whiteboard in their office.
[09:44.250 --> 09:46.350]  Well, Barbara asked if it was their whiteboard.
[09:46.810 --> 09:47.390]  Yeah, there you go.
[09:47.710 --> 09:48.830]  Very distrustful.
[09:48.910 --> 09:53.490]  Anyway, so I'm feeling really unliked right now by the rest of the company.
[09:53.670 --> 09:56.810]  Which is something I've been suspecting for about 15 years.
[09:57.230 --> 10:00.150]  Really solidified in the hallways of Rooster Teeth today.
[10:00.370 --> 10:01.690]  Don't appreciate it.
[10:01.930 --> 10:01.970]  Tough.
[10:03.590 --> 10:04.450]  Damn, dude.
[10:05.070 --> 10:05.570]  This is why...
[10:05.570 --> 10:07.530]  I feel like that's the reaction we want.
[10:10.530 --> 10:15.090]  Like, am I sad that we walk out of a room and John sighs?
[10:15.530 --> 10:17.370]  A little, but mainly it's funny.
[10:17.670 --> 10:19.110]  I think that's the vibe.
[10:19.770 --> 10:20.970]  Like, I was happy to see John.
[10:21.050 --> 10:22.070]  I was like, oh, there's John.
[10:22.410 --> 10:23.650]  John was not happy to see Geoff.
[10:23.770 --> 10:24.790]  Totally different reactions.
[10:25.030 --> 10:25.550]  Different faces.
[10:26.870 --> 10:28.470]  This is starting to broach on f*** face.
[10:28.550 --> 10:29.210]  I'm just letting you know.
[10:29.290 --> 10:30.310]  So shit to discuss.
[10:30.410 --> 10:36.830]  Have we ever had something that was latched onto as strongly as extra medium so far on the podcast?
[10:36.830 --> 10:38.250]  And it's only just started.
[10:38.430 --> 10:40.990]  Like, if we were trying to go for an episode with engagement.
[10:41.270 --> 10:41.430]  Yeah.
[10:41.670 --> 10:43.210]  I feel like that one probably has the most comments.
[10:43.710 --> 10:45.290]  I would think that and the pencil.
[10:45.670 --> 10:47.590]  Maybe the pencil trial was a lot.
[10:47.770 --> 10:47.950]  Yeah.
[10:48.550 --> 10:50.730]  Yeah, I think so.
[10:50.850 --> 10:52.690]  But it is definitely in the top three.
[10:52.830 --> 10:59.550]  And also, I think the thing that's the most amazing about it is I didn't anticipate any of that.
[10:59.630 --> 10:59.790]  No.
[10:59.870 --> 11:03.690]  Like, I didn't think, oh, this is something that the audience is going to have strong opinions on.
[11:03.770 --> 11:03.930]  No.
[11:05.070 --> 11:06.730]  And really like to be into.
[11:06.930 --> 11:08.130]  It was throwaway to me.
[11:08.250 --> 11:11.030]  I did not realize it was going to take on this life that it has.
[11:11.210 --> 11:13.450]  It was kind of throwaway the first time it came up.
[11:13.590 --> 11:17.070]  But I think the second time and then especially when everyone started turning.
[11:17.310 --> 11:17.450]  Yeah.
[11:17.510 --> 11:17.830]  Oh, yeah.
[11:17.990 --> 11:18.170]  Yeah.
[11:18.570 --> 11:19.650]  The turn's been tough.
[11:20.090 --> 11:20.970]  It's been tough on Eric.
[11:21.050 --> 11:23.630]  So I didn't really hear the story about your wife.
[11:24.090 --> 11:24.730]  Oh, I guess we didn't.
[11:24.790 --> 11:25.690]  I just brought it up.
[11:27.610 --> 11:29.110]  She's like, what's the extra medium thing?
[11:29.230 --> 11:30.170]  And I explained it.
[11:30.170 --> 11:34.050]  And that like just found its way on her radar without you mentioning.
[11:34.210 --> 11:34.330]  Yeah.
[11:34.570 --> 11:37.310]  She saw the extra medium like tweets or whatever.
[11:37.830 --> 11:39.030]  And she just went, what is this?
[11:39.390 --> 11:41.810]  And I said, what would you like?
[11:42.030 --> 11:43.510]  Gavin asked for an extra medium shirt.
[11:43.990 --> 11:44.710]  What size is that?
[11:44.770 --> 11:45.890]  And she went, medium.
[11:46.070 --> 11:46.830]  And I went, all right.
[11:46.990 --> 11:48.030]  Well, she's so right.
[11:49.110 --> 11:51.670]  So it's been divisive in my household.
[11:51.810 --> 11:52.830]  It was a quiet evening that night.
[11:53.110 --> 11:53.830]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:53.930 --> 11:56.730]  But we had the similar conversation with it happened.
[11:56.730 --> 12:00.510]  And then we recorded another show with Jason Saldana.
[12:01.210 --> 12:03.890]  And we asked, hey, what's the extra medium?
[12:04.010 --> 12:04.790]  And he agreed with me.
[12:04.950 --> 12:05.970]  He's like, it's large.
[12:06.050 --> 12:06.690]  It's like a bigger medium.
[12:06.790 --> 12:07.370]  It's like a large.
[12:07.510 --> 12:08.150]  Text Jason right now.
[12:08.150 --> 12:11.730]  And then he asked his wife and his wife said medium.
[12:12.250 --> 12:13.590]  And I said, it's fine.
[12:13.650 --> 12:16.770]  It's you're going to give it a couple of weeks and you'll turn to it.
[12:16.830 --> 12:17.270]  Doesn't matter.
[12:18.090 --> 12:18.810]  So here we go.
[12:19.030 --> 12:19.290]  I'm texting Jason right now.
[12:19.350 --> 12:20.270]  You think medium?
[12:21.110 --> 12:24.070]  I have the conversation between Gus, Jason and I.
[12:24.170 --> 12:24.350]  OK.
[12:25.190 --> 12:27.110]  I hope Jason doesn't mind me sharing this.
[12:28.510 --> 12:33.630]  I posed the extra medium conundrum to, I'll say it to my wife and laid out both sides
[12:33.630 --> 12:34.230]  very clearly.
[12:34.410 --> 12:35.890]  She had a really interesting perspective.
[12:36.250 --> 12:37.530]  She thinks we're all idiots.
[12:39.630 --> 12:42.150]  And I said, but what's the right answer?
[12:42.330 --> 12:44.170]  And he says, OK, we just talked about it more.
[12:44.510 --> 12:47.710]  Her position is that extra medium does not exist.
[12:47.870 --> 12:53.090]  There is medium only acceptable shirt sizes through the range would be extra small, small,
[12:53.090 --> 12:55.690]  medium, medium, large, large, extra large.
[12:56.770 --> 13:00.150]  And then Jason said, and I was like, what the hell?
[13:00.390 --> 13:02.330]  And Jason was like, but aren't you a large guy?
[13:02.390 --> 13:03.270]  How do you feel about medium?
[13:03.470 --> 13:07.730]  And I'm like, it's as valid as large to me, medium is as valid as large.
[13:08.390 --> 13:13.770]  And then Jason said, Gus said, is extra medium closer to medium, medium or large?
[13:16.850 --> 13:20.170]  I think you're activating a sleeper cell somewhere.
[13:21.930 --> 13:25.630]  This is like that movie with, what's it?
[13:26.070 --> 13:29.270]  Fucking Mel Gibson, where he reads Catcher in the Rye and then he kills people.
[13:29.370 --> 13:29.930]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:30.330 --> 13:32.370]  I would love to get an answer to that, Jason said.
[13:32.590 --> 13:37.590]  She's gone chaotic and has decided extra medium doesn't exist.
[13:37.710 --> 13:39.770]  And therefore, the question is no longer valid.
[13:41.470 --> 13:42.590]  And that's where he ended up.
[13:42.810 --> 13:45.070]  Oh, and then he said, this is interesting.
[13:45.230 --> 13:48.370]  He said, let's start a movement where we just resize clothes to one through ten.
[13:49.030 --> 13:51.470]  That's a great, that's a very good idea.
[13:51.750 --> 13:51.790]  What?
[13:52.210 --> 13:54.850]  Because there's no hard limit to how big someone can be.
[13:55.250 --> 13:56.190]  Then I don't understand.
[13:56.390 --> 13:57.730]  What the fuck did you just say?
[13:57.750 --> 14:00.090]  We already have that with fucking shirt sizes.
[14:00.730 --> 14:01.890]  We're just numbering it.
[14:02.050 --> 14:02.990]  What's a ten?
[14:04.110 --> 14:07.670]  I don't think the scale might be big enough.
[14:08.230 --> 14:10.690]  Like how many numbers? I think we might need more numbers.
[14:11.030 --> 14:14.250]  So let's start with extra small is one, small is two.
[14:15.630 --> 14:16.110]  Medium?
[14:16.310 --> 14:16.750]  Is three.
[14:16.750 --> 14:18.610]  Medium is four.
[14:19.470 --> 14:21.390]  Is extra medium in there somewhere?
[14:21.550 --> 14:22.030]  Yeah, it's four.
[14:24.750 --> 14:27.390]  Whatever you call, medium is four.
[14:28.330 --> 14:29.350]  Large is five.
[14:30.070 --> 14:31.230]  Large is six.
[14:31.610 --> 14:32.530]  Extra large is seven.
[14:32.750 --> 14:34.010]  And then we go up to 3x on shirts.
[14:34.030 --> 14:36.530]  So you go two, three, you get to 4x.
[14:36.630 --> 14:36.990]  And that's ten.
[14:37.090 --> 14:37.750]  Size one through ten.
[14:37.790 --> 14:38.730]  That's pretty good.
[14:38.770 --> 14:39.690]  That's a pretty good range.
[14:40.130 --> 14:42.230]  That's what most shirt ranges are.
[14:42.670 --> 14:46.270]  And that makes more sense to me than like if I were to say, Gavin, what shoe size do you wear?
[14:46.270 --> 14:47.550]  And you go, I wear a large.
[14:48.110 --> 14:49.270]  Like that doesn't make sense to me.
[14:49.290 --> 14:50.870]  But if you tell me you wear a ten, I go, okay.
[14:51.090 --> 14:52.230]  I know how big your penis is.
[14:54.210 --> 14:56.910]  Andrew, do you agree with shirt sizing one through ten?
[14:57.010 --> 14:57.850]  I don't.
[14:58.330 --> 14:59.530]  Something about it feels off.
[14:59.850 --> 15:00.790]  I'm kind of with Gavin.
[15:00.910 --> 15:02.050]  Like what you're saying is logical.
[15:02.490 --> 15:04.870]  You're going to be selling 11s and 12s to some people.
[15:05.170 --> 15:08.670]  Yeah, and then like, will there be different for different genders?
[15:08.870 --> 15:10.610]  Will there be different number combination?
[15:11.470 --> 15:14.190]  What you're expressing already exists.
[15:14.210 --> 15:14.330]  I know.
[15:14.330 --> 15:15.870]  So what are you talking about?
[15:15.890 --> 15:16.290]  You're not wrong.
[15:16.310 --> 15:16.610]  I know.
[15:16.990 --> 15:17.830]  Andrew, I know.
[15:18.350 --> 15:19.730]  You said the scale was one to ten.
[15:19.790 --> 15:20.030]  Right.
[15:20.130 --> 15:20.550]  It is.
[15:20.730 --> 15:21.330]  It's one to ten.
[15:21.470 --> 15:22.850]  And then he said, well, what about genders?
[15:23.210 --> 15:24.210]  Like, right.
[15:24.250 --> 15:24.990]  That already exists.
[15:25.210 --> 15:27.430]  A women's medium is different from a men's medium.
[15:27.610 --> 15:27.750]  Yeah.
[15:27.870 --> 15:29.650]  So I don't know what the issue is here.
[15:30.830 --> 15:33.430]  A children's medium is different than an adult medium.
[15:33.990 --> 15:34.490]  Like, I don't.
[15:34.550 --> 15:35.470]  Yeah, I don't.
[15:35.490 --> 15:37.750]  I logically can't fight against you right now.
[15:37.970 --> 15:38.590]  Because I'm right.
[15:38.950 --> 15:40.870]  Can you often logically fight against people?
[15:42.550 --> 15:43.330]  It's debatable.
[15:43.330 --> 15:48.770]  I saw such a good little synopsis for f***face.
[15:48.910 --> 15:49.230]  Uh-huh.
[15:49.390 --> 15:51.810]  There was a comment someone left just describing Andrew.
[15:51.910 --> 15:52.730]  I just thought it was brilliant.
[15:52.990 --> 15:53.610]  Mm-hmm.
[15:54.670 --> 15:59.790]  Bayron on our site said, Andrew has the ability to take on a bet, lose immensely,
[16:00.150 --> 16:03.990]  and then cause a 15-minute debate to explain how he didn't lose,
[16:04.290 --> 16:08.030]  while simultaneously proving just how hard he did lose.
[16:08.370 --> 16:13.310]  I think that is such a phenomenal take on...
[16:13.970 --> 16:15.710]  You've got all the skills required.
[16:16.730 --> 16:17.170]  Goddamn.
[16:17.450 --> 16:18.190]  Oh, man.
[16:18.250 --> 16:19.950]  Who said that? Phaedron?
[16:20.210 --> 16:20.650]  Bayron?
[16:22.150 --> 16:22.590]  Phenomenon?
[16:24.150 --> 16:25.150]  It's so wrong.
[16:25.450 --> 16:25.890]  Phalanx?
[16:26.210 --> 16:27.390]  Your ability to forget a name.
[16:27.830 --> 16:29.010]  Seven seconds up there.
[16:29.070 --> 16:33.970]  Is this a show where we just give Geoff a name, ask him one other question,
[16:34.150 --> 16:35.370]  and go, hey, so what was that name?
[16:35.910 --> 16:38.170]  It's like you can play the Beetlejuice game with me.
[16:38.570 --> 16:39.290]  Spell red.
[16:39.550 --> 16:40.550]  Alright, 3X7.
[16:41.890 --> 16:42.330]  Red.
[16:43.270 --> 16:48.310]  How has your life changed, Gavin, since becoming the face of Extra Medium?
[16:48.430 --> 16:51.430]  Have you felt precious in other eras?
[16:52.470 --> 16:54.450]  I just feel like I've done good work there.
[16:55.530 --> 17:00.370]  And Eric looks at me funny every time it comes up, he scowls, he looks down,
[17:00.670 --> 17:02.350]  and I think that is the intended effect.
[17:02.490 --> 17:07.930]  It's so infuriating, especially when you guys go, yeah, I don't like to agree with them,
[17:07.970 --> 17:09.350]  but I have to agree with them.
[17:09.350 --> 17:11.010]  That's my favorite part.
[17:11.210 --> 17:15.730]  I think it was in episode 119 where everyone started to change their opinion
[17:15.730 --> 17:20.390]  and they would all explain why, and they were just repeating the exact thing I said on the previous episode.
[17:20.590 --> 17:21.810]  Almost word for word.
[17:22.230 --> 17:24.670]  Geoff did it, Nick was like, oh, I see Geoff's point.
[17:24.770 --> 17:26.410]  I was like, Geoff's point's my point.
[17:26.990 --> 17:32.350]  Yeah, but you have a way of being accurately distasteful.
[17:33.370 --> 17:36.690]  Like, you're right, but in a way that makes people not on board with you.
[17:37.570 --> 17:38.890]  I don't know what it is.
[17:39.330 --> 17:42.210]  Like, I could get up there in front of everyone behind the podium and be like,
[17:42.490 --> 17:44.890]  wait, come on, guys, you've got to remember what Geoff said.
[17:45.530 --> 17:47.790]  And then someone comes up and says the same thing.
[17:49.030 --> 17:53.230]  All this being said, first bullet point under shit to discuss,
[17:53.270 --> 17:54.890]  because this is a board meeting, I guess.
[17:55.670 --> 17:58.250]  What do we do with extra medium?
[17:58.690 --> 18:04.070]  So we could change the shirts in the store to just say small, extra medium, large.
[18:04.210 --> 18:05.450]  Here's why I think that's a good idea.
[18:06.510 --> 18:07.670]  It's a funny joke.
[18:07.670 --> 18:10.570]  It's a nice little, you know, nice little reference.
[18:10.910 --> 18:15.150]  But also, it's going to confuse people and potentially damage sales.
[18:15.350 --> 18:17.450]  Which is the point of the show.
[18:18.610 --> 18:19.490]  It's the point of the show.
[18:19.610 --> 18:20.590]  I think that is the point of the show.
[18:20.650 --> 18:21.230]  It's the point of the show.
[18:21.470 --> 18:22.470]  I like the idea of it.
[18:22.750 --> 18:23.750]  Yeah, it's the point of the show.
[18:23.990 --> 18:25.710]  All right, hang on, I'm doing it.
[18:25.750 --> 18:30.310]  We just had a sales thing come through where, this is some of the sausage,
[18:31.890 --> 18:38.170]  where they were like, hey, this other reasonably popular podcast is open to doing trade ads.
[18:38.330 --> 18:39.450]  Which, you know, you do sometimes.
[18:39.590 --> 18:43.150]  Like, hey, we'll run a free ad on your podcast, you run a free ad on ours.
[18:43.530 --> 18:45.950]  You know, it's like you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours kind of thing.
[18:47.010 --> 18:52.250]  And it goes to all the different, I guess like podcast IP holders,
[18:52.270 --> 18:53.430]  and everybody says yes or no.
[18:53.610 --> 18:58.350]  And it gets to me, and I'm like, yeah, if they want to do a face ad, I'm all about it.
[18:58.350 --> 19:01.370]  And then like an hour later, I get an email that's like, yeah, they're probably not interested.
[19:05.090 --> 19:09.870]  There you go. All right, so I put in the request with our merchandise department to,
[19:10.150 --> 19:14.310]  can we change the size medium on everything F*** Face to extra medium, please?
[19:15.030 --> 19:17.550]  Do we still have that sizing chart as well that you can pull up?
[19:17.930 --> 19:19.850]  Why would I need to give them the sizing chart?
[19:19.990 --> 19:21.850]  No, so you can change the sizing chart.
[19:22.010 --> 19:24.330]  It's only on F*** Face merch.
[19:25.750 --> 19:26.790]  Eric's got his head in his hands.
[19:27.450 --> 19:29.350]  Which is immediately telling me we should do that.
[19:29.490 --> 19:30.070]  Yeah, you gotta be thorough.
[19:31.130 --> 19:33.330]  So do I have to give them a sizing chart?
[19:33.510 --> 19:36.010]  No, just say that can you change it on the sizing chart too, but only for F*** Face.
[19:36.910 --> 19:38.630]  So let's just assume this all happens.
[19:38.910 --> 19:39.910]  Let's run this through.
[19:40.130 --> 19:41.230]  So it's extra medium.
[19:41.650 --> 19:45.290]  Gavin, you buy an extra medium shirt from the store, one of the F*** Face ones.
[19:45.550 --> 19:47.930]  Would you be disappointed that it's just medium?
[19:48.310 --> 19:49.730]  That it is not extra medium?
[19:49.810 --> 19:51.590]  I'd probably be thankful that it's not large.
[19:53.210 --> 19:54.170]  Okay, that's fair.
[19:54.710 --> 19:55.310]  It's a great point.
[19:56.250 --> 19:59.370]  Are you going to start ordering other things extra medium?
[20:00.230 --> 20:01.950]  Like, I think you need to take this into the field.
[20:02.090 --> 20:02.550]  Like a steak.
[20:02.910 --> 20:03.750]  That's what my wife said.
[20:03.750 --> 20:04.630]  Next time you order a steak.
[20:04.790 --> 20:06.670]  That's what my wife said when I brought it up to her.
[20:06.890 --> 20:09.130]  She just said, like, we're going to go to a steakhouse.
[20:09.230 --> 20:10.930]  I'm going to order a steak extra medium.
[20:11.170 --> 20:14.670]  And then the waiter's going to have to watch us get a divorce on the spot.
[20:17.970 --> 20:20.550]  I feel like we should all try out that homework.
[20:20.710 --> 20:21.870]  I'm not doing it!
[20:22.110 --> 20:22.150]  No!
[20:22.310 --> 20:22.810]  What do you mean?
[20:23.250 --> 20:24.850]  Because they're going to give me something well done.
[20:26.270 --> 20:26.790]  Should we?
[20:27.470 --> 20:30.270]  I think it's interesting to test that and see if we all got the same result.
[20:30.290 --> 20:30.890]  Here's what we do.
[20:30.930 --> 20:31.650]  That is fascinating.
[20:32.150 --> 20:34.630]  Let's all get a steak dinner together.
[20:34.990 --> 20:35.690]  Or a steak lunch.
[20:35.810 --> 20:35.990]  Okay.
[20:36.210 --> 20:40.690]  And one of us will order it medium rare, one of us will order it medium, and one of us will order it extra medium.
[20:40.790 --> 20:41.390]  I love this idea.
[20:42.190 --> 20:43.490]  Gavin can order his extra medium.
[20:43.630 --> 20:44.710]  Why don't we flip a coin?
[20:45.350 --> 20:46.230]  I'm not doing it.
[20:46.610 --> 20:47.530]  I'm ordering my medium.
[20:48.530 --> 20:48.610]  Let's flip a sock.
[20:49.390 --> 20:50.230]  Let's flip a sock.
[20:50.490 --> 20:52.450]  I think it has to be random and I hope it's you.
[20:57.230 --> 20:57.950]  This sucks.
[21:00.150 --> 21:02.470]  Alright, well, let's table that. I think we should get steak lunch.
[21:02.670 --> 21:02.850]  Okay.
[21:03.110 --> 21:04.170]  I'm into steak lunch.
[21:04.430 --> 21:07.150]  That could be on our next Uniform Board Meeting.
[21:07.170 --> 21:07.750]  Oh, that's true.
[21:07.990 --> 21:08.270]  Yeah, that's true.
[21:08.730 --> 21:12.330]  Sorry, Andrew, I'll buy you like a Big Mac and you can be like...
[21:12.690 --> 21:13.870]  Also, I...
[21:13.870 --> 21:15.010]  Or we could fly you here.
[21:15.210 --> 21:19.310]  I may need to change the date of our next board meeting. I may be out of town.
[21:19.630 --> 21:21.910]  I didn't even know we had a date for the next board meeting.
[21:22.150 --> 21:22.910]  It's on the calendar.
[21:23.430 --> 21:23.630]  Is it?
[21:24.390 --> 21:25.510]  It's just a month from today.
[21:25.850 --> 21:26.970]  Oh, Jason texted me back.
[21:27.070 --> 21:27.530]  Oh, what did he say?
[21:27.750 --> 21:29.130]  Oh my God, it's a paragraph.
[21:29.310 --> 21:31.530]  Oh my God, it's so much text.
[21:32.190 --> 21:33.490]  It's so much.
[21:33.790 --> 21:39.590]  Should I just say, if we haven't made it clear, Jason is somebody who used to work with Rooster Teeth and who's been a friend of...
[21:39.590 --> 21:45.070]  Well, a friend of all of ours, but a friend of mine for longer. He's the person I've known the longest in Austin.
[21:46.550 --> 21:51.070]  He was on another episode of Anima, which is great. That was really fun.
[21:51.190 --> 21:51.350]  Yeah.
[21:52.010 --> 21:54.490]  But now Gavin's just getting paragraphs.
[21:55.090 --> 21:58.090]  Do you want to read the dissertation? Is it safe?
[21:59.070 --> 22:00.410]  Yeah, I think I can read it.
[22:00.750 --> 22:03.270]  He said, I think in principle an extra medium would be bigger than...
[22:03.270 --> 22:04.670]  Oh, he's writing more. He's writing more.
[22:04.950 --> 22:07.250]  Would be bigger than medium and smaller than large.
[22:07.390 --> 22:11.930]  This is despite agreeing with the fact that extra does not inherently just mean bigger.
[22:12.290 --> 22:18.870]  I feel like if someone asked me for an extra medium shirt, I'd think, oh, this little guy is growing up but can't quite fill out a large.
[22:19.970 --> 22:27.850]  If you worked at a movie theater and someone ordered an extra medium popcorn, what would you take that to mean? Or would you just quit on the spot?
[22:29.110 --> 22:31.870]  When I post the extra medium thing to...
[22:32.650 --> 22:32.990]  My wife.
[22:33.770 --> 22:35.790]  Her contention was that was stupid.
[22:38.270 --> 22:43.250]  So if extra medium is a little bit more medium than medium, would under medium be the reverse?
[22:43.410 --> 22:47.610]  Fuck off. I just, I don't get it. I don't understand why this is...
[22:47.610 --> 22:55.930]  I took a picture of some sweatpants that I bought and on inside the waistband, I found this.
[22:55.970 --> 22:57.110]  Oh my god.
[22:57.130 --> 22:57.730]  That's a regular medium.
[22:57.910 --> 22:59.430]  Can you hold that up for Andrew and the camera?
[22:59.630 --> 23:00.290]  No, I saw it.
[23:00.590 --> 23:02.290]  Regular medium.
[23:03.210 --> 23:05.830]  That does imply that there are other mediums.
[23:06.110 --> 23:11.370]  Yeah. So I think medium is much more of a gray area than you originally thought.
[23:11.810 --> 23:13.110]  And those are gray sweatpants.
[23:13.150 --> 23:14.110]  And they are very gray, yeah.
[23:15.290 --> 23:17.090]  So chest ironing board, huh?
[23:18.790 --> 23:23.430]  Do we want to make, like, should we try to make an extra medium shirt, like a comment leaver shirt or something?
[23:23.470 --> 23:24.810]  Or is there any point? Is that too dumb?
[23:25.330 --> 23:27.010]  Maybe an extra medium koozie?
[23:27.470 --> 23:29.730]  I feel like all the dumbest ideas should go to koozie.
[23:29.990 --> 23:32.450]  Yeah, I don't think we should just slap extra medium on a shirt.
[23:32.710 --> 23:32.810]  Right.
[23:32.850 --> 23:34.270]  It doesn't feel like there's a point to that.
[23:34.370 --> 23:34.530]  No.
[23:35.130 --> 23:37.250]  Other than changing, so maybe it's enough to change the sizes.
[23:37.330 --> 23:39.350]  I think changing the sizes is good.
[23:39.550 --> 23:42.510]  I mean, I don't think it's good, but I think it's getting the point across.
[23:43.750 --> 23:52.030]  And maybe we can start, this is really overcomplicating it, like putting XM in the medium shirts when we make them in the future.
[23:52.250 --> 23:55.230]  I can see if that's something that's doable.
[23:55.510 --> 23:59.810]  We do print on the info on the inside back of the shirt, right?
[23:59.910 --> 24:00.090]  Yeah.
[24:00.190 --> 24:03.790]  I just don't know if that's like a file we make or whether it's something the manufacturer pulls.
[24:04.010 --> 24:06.670]  No, no, no, it's a file we make. We can change that. We should change that.
[24:06.750 --> 24:06.930]  Yeah.
[24:07.210 --> 24:07.930]  That's fantastic.
[24:08.230 --> 24:09.530]  As of right now, yeah.
[24:10.190 --> 24:10.990]  Medium shirts.
[24:10.990 --> 24:18.650]  As a matter of fact, if you have, from this point on, from today on, if you have any f*** face shirt that just says medium on it...
[24:18.650 --> 24:19.170]  Limited edition.
[24:19.390 --> 24:23.510]  Hold on to it. It is a limited edition. They will never be made again.
[24:23.630 --> 24:30.290]  I now know my favorite part of these uniform board meetings is the amount of times Eric has to sigh and then start typing on his phone.
[24:32.210 --> 24:33.890]  It's the third one I've sent.
[24:38.850 --> 24:45.030]  So, next bullet point. Chest ironing board was a joke that came out of the end of episode one of Does It Do?
[24:45.110 --> 24:45.230]  Yeah.
[24:45.390 --> 24:50.490]  Which premiered today. Did very well. I feel like we should make it. I feel like there's no point in not making it.
[24:50.590 --> 24:54.310]  And then would this be like a shirt that's an ironing board that you shove up?
[24:54.410 --> 25:01.850]  Here's what I think we do. And I bring this up because I can totally make this at home like I'm going to make the fruit gloves, which I still haven't made.
[25:02.290 --> 25:08.910]  Like I made the beef bracelet. Like I made the too spicy IAC. Like I made the wrist pocket. All the hits from uniform.
[25:09.230 --> 25:13.950]  I can do it myself. But since we have an office day, we can do it together too.
[25:14.190 --> 25:17.530]  I'll give you an idea of my brain prototype and see what you guys think.
[25:17.730 --> 25:21.830]  Here's what I'm thinking. We take a regular sized ironing board. We cut it in half.
[25:21.850 --> 25:22.590]  And then we're done.
[25:23.030 --> 25:33.890]  No, no. Then then we get like we get like a belt that we that we affix to the back of the bottom half of it that you can put right around your waist so that when you sit, it sits in your lap.
[25:34.090 --> 25:40.690]  And then we get a backpack, cut the shoulder straps off, glue them to the top of the to the back of the top part of the iron.
[25:40.790 --> 25:46.130]  So you can put it on like a reverse backpack and then you can walk around. You have a full ironing board.
[25:46.150 --> 25:47.750]  So it's more like sit. It bends.
[25:48.210 --> 25:53.210]  I imagine like when they put on those big leaf blowers where it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, kind of like that.
[25:53.690 --> 25:59.130]  But then you have to get it under your shirt. I feel like you've just made body armor in like a Mad Max universe.
[25:59.330 --> 26:02.630]  And this is not actually a product that does make body armor.
[26:03.570 --> 26:08.690]  And is the goal to do ironing on yourself or is the goal to iron the shirt you're wearing?
[26:08.790 --> 26:10.890]  No, the goal is to do to iron on yourself.
[26:11.250 --> 26:13.990]  So it's not like I've put on a crease shirt. Let me pop on.
[26:13.990 --> 26:23.770]  Yes, you could, in theory, put your chest ironing board on shirtless and then put the shirt on over the top of you and then iron directly on.
[26:23.870 --> 26:28.010]  I think that's a great idea and totally should be possible.
[26:28.490 --> 26:35.110]  But you can also if like say you're at a hotel and you're like, oh, thank God I remembered I got my clothes are fucked up.
[26:35.170 --> 26:37.610]  Thank God I remember to pack my folding ironing board.
[26:37.690 --> 26:39.330]  There's an ironing board at the hotel.
[26:39.330 --> 26:42.690]  You don't have one. So you pull out your folding ironing board because you're short on space.
[26:42.770 --> 26:44.650]  It's like a British hotel. So there's no room.
[26:44.950 --> 26:46.270]  They're all three feet fucking wide.
[26:46.730 --> 26:52.710]  And you can like sit in your one chair in the hotel room, plug in the iron and then lay your clothes out on your lap and then iron on your lap.
[26:52.830 --> 26:54.850]  Or if they're a little tall, iron up on your chest.
[26:55.330 --> 26:57.090]  This is a fantastic product.
[26:57.930 --> 26:58.750]  We should make it.
[26:59.010 --> 27:02.650]  But the question is, do y'all want to make it with me or do you just want me to show up and give it to you?
[27:02.710 --> 27:04.350]  Oh, I definitely want to be part of it.
[27:04.610 --> 27:04.870]  Okay.
[27:05.210 --> 27:08.750]  There's definitely value in the blind sort of show and tell aspect of stuff.
[27:08.750 --> 27:09.690]  I agree. That's true.
[27:09.910 --> 27:13.250]  I would also be willing to test a little collaborative effort on this one.
[27:13.490 --> 27:14.970]  Yeah, I think it's worth it.
[27:15.010 --> 27:23.850]  Because like, you know, we had a pre-boardroom meeting earlier this week, which we actually talked on Face, where we kind of planned out the rest of the season of Does It Do?
[27:24.870 --> 27:28.670]  And everything that we came up with was made better by the group.
[27:28.870 --> 27:30.550]  Oh, yeah. It was a great meeting.
[27:30.770 --> 27:33.630]  Every idea was improved upon because of the group interaction.
[27:33.630 --> 27:38.850]  So in my head, I can make the ironing board that is in my head, and I know it will work.
[27:38.950 --> 27:39.770]  I know it'll be awesome.
[27:40.070 --> 27:44.990]  But I can't help but feel like if we all make it together, it'll turn out to be a better ironing board.
[27:45.030 --> 27:46.530]  You guys will have ideas that I never would have thought of.
[27:46.550 --> 27:48.690]  Should we try to do that today?
[27:48.970 --> 27:53.870]  Because we have, I mean, we can go to lock up and probably find a lot of this stuff.
[27:54.050 --> 27:54.290]  Yeah.
[27:54.650 --> 27:55.530]  And make it happen.
[27:55.690 --> 27:57.210]  I just can't take Andrew with us.
[27:57.450 --> 28:00.650]  Andrew would have to wait, and then we could, like, come back, you know, like, later.
[28:01.990 --> 28:04.630]  Well, we could do that, or we could build it next office meeting.
[28:04.830 --> 28:05.870]  I'm fine with either.
[28:06.130 --> 28:08.710]  I think it's too far away, but that's just me.
[28:08.790 --> 28:09.710]  Yeah, that is too far away.
[28:09.930 --> 28:10.970]  Maybe we'll break for lunch.
[28:11.090 --> 28:11.310]  Okay.
[28:11.510 --> 28:11.830]  Or something.
[28:12.530 --> 28:13.910]  Steak lunch and then figure it out.
[28:14.110 --> 28:15.930]  And then, of course, we should make a commercial for it.
[28:16.030 --> 28:17.610]  And then put the commercial on TikTok.
[28:18.150 --> 28:19.090]  Just make a TikTok commercial.
[28:20.370 --> 28:21.730]  And then don't, like...
[28:21.730 --> 28:22.050]  That's it.
[28:22.710 --> 28:23.270]  That's it?
[28:23.470 --> 28:24.430]  And that's where it lives.
[28:24.490 --> 28:24.850]  Okay.
[28:25.530 --> 28:25.830]  I think.
[28:27.110 --> 28:28.630]  MVP, well, we already covered it.
[28:28.630 --> 28:30.190]  Banana wipes are holding us back.
[28:30.690 --> 28:31.310]  Right, but...
[28:31.950 --> 28:33.550]  Right, but when are we gonna do it?
[28:33.630 --> 28:34.970]  Alright, yeah, we need to...
[28:36.590 --> 28:38.650]  This has been scheduled...
[28:38.650 --> 28:39.430]  Twice?
[28:39.810 --> 28:41.010]  No, three times.
[28:41.210 --> 28:41.590]  Three times?
[28:41.770 --> 28:43.090]  Yeah, two or three times.
[28:43.090 --> 28:43.590]  This'll be four.
[28:43.910 --> 28:44.710]  This'll be number four.
[28:45.050 --> 28:46.950]  I think Geoff moved it once, Andrew moved it once.
[28:47.610 --> 28:49.030]  I'll probably move it next time.
[28:49.310 --> 28:49.710]  Great.
[28:50.470 --> 28:50.870]  Fantastic.
[28:51.850 --> 28:52.510]  That's great.
[28:52.670 --> 28:53.090]  Thank you.
[28:53.770 --> 28:56.730]  Let's just schedule it for a day we know we can't do it on, and then Gavin can move it.
[28:57.190 --> 28:57.830]  No, I wanna move it.
[28:57.830 --> 28:59.710]  I really wanna watch this stupid monkey movie.
[28:59.970 --> 29:04.850]  Andrew, how much time do you need to get from 6% to 100%?
[29:06.070 --> 29:11.030]  Not necessarily a lot of time, I just didn't want to put any effort in until it was locked in on a day.
[29:12.310 --> 29:14.990]  So you give me a day, then I will get it done by that day.
[29:14.990 --> 29:16.950]  We did multiple, many times we gave you days!
[29:17.330 --> 29:20.090]  Yeah, but it got pushed the last time.
[29:20.330 --> 29:21.450]  Is 16th something?
[29:22.670 --> 29:24.190]  Is the 16th, that's a Friday?
[29:24.390 --> 29:25.370]  I'm looking, hold on.
[29:26.050 --> 29:26.690]  Of this month?
[29:27.670 --> 29:27.990]  Yes.
[29:28.090 --> 29:28.590]  I'm gone.
[29:28.770 --> 29:29.890]  I think Gavin's gone, yeah.
[29:30.590 --> 29:31.690]  Back on the 22nd, though.
[29:33.010 --> 29:34.690]  You mean the 23rd?
[29:35.690 --> 29:36.650]  Yeah, about the 23rd.
[29:37.650 --> 29:38.590]  Morning of the 23rd?
[29:39.810 --> 29:40.130]  September?
[29:40.690 --> 29:41.410]  It's my daughter's birthday.
[29:41.730 --> 29:42.790]  In honor of Millie.
[29:42.950 --> 29:43.510]  Hang on, go ahead.
[29:43.690 --> 29:44.810]  Well, I have therapy in the morning.
[29:44.970 --> 29:45.870]  Yeah, right, right, right.
[29:45.990 --> 29:46.270]  That's fine.
[29:46.370 --> 29:47.350]  No, that's important, you need it.
[29:47.370 --> 29:48.230]  But what if we do...
[29:48.230 --> 29:49.030]  Let's do it after.
[29:49.090 --> 29:51.070]  What if we do, like, noon to three?
[29:51.430 --> 29:51.790]  Hell yeah.
[29:52.510 --> 29:53.630]  Let's have a monkey lunch.
[29:54.030 --> 29:54.470]  Monkey lunch?
[29:54.470 --> 29:56.270]  Oh, it sounds fantastic.
[29:56.750 --> 29:59.310]  We'll eat bananas and banana flavored stuff.
[29:59.410 --> 30:00.130]  I'm good.
[30:00.670 --> 30:00.930]  Okay.
[30:02.030 --> 30:02.850]  That's it.
[30:03.070 --> 30:05.350]  Monkey lunch being added now.
[30:06.870 --> 30:09.150]  Andrew, include Nick as well.
[30:09.730 --> 30:11.230]  How to do a banana wipe.
[30:11.690 --> 30:14.050]  I love how everything is percentages at the moment.
[30:15.070 --> 30:16.010]  It's coming up a lot.
[30:16.310 --> 30:20.290]  We've been a percentages podcast, I think, for a while now, but not outright.
[30:20.470 --> 30:21.910]  It has definitely ramped up.
[30:21.910 --> 30:27.850]  I would love to make a shirt that is a take on what Nick posted yesterday in the Discord of the Fallout guy.
[30:28.530 --> 30:32.910]  And it just has both ankles dotted and it just says crippled by both.
[30:33.350 --> 30:33.930]  Zero percent.
[30:36.410 --> 30:38.090]  And it's just Andrew as the face.
[30:38.270 --> 30:42.370]  Should we have it be, like, all three of us next to each other and it just shows everybody's illness?
[30:45.730 --> 30:47.510]  But it's all just ankles.
[30:50.110 --> 30:50.990]  Oh, man.
[30:51.150 --> 30:55.330]  There was a time when there were five bad ankles between the three of us.
[30:55.450 --> 30:56.210]  You guys are crazy.
[30:57.710 --> 30:58.710]  What a mess.
[31:01.310 --> 31:02.350]  Oh, man.
[31:03.210 --> 31:06.150]  I didn't think I would do both my ankles in my own office.
[31:06.430 --> 31:07.150]  That was quite a shot.
[31:07.330 --> 31:08.090]  That was really something.
[31:08.390 --> 31:11.970]  I told that to my girlfriend last night and she laughed so hard.
[31:12.230 --> 31:15.610]  And at no point did she, like, wonder if you were okay.
[31:16.450 --> 31:17.150]  Well, you know.
[31:18.110 --> 31:19.270]  I no-showed the meal.
[31:19.810 --> 31:21.650]  Well, that's just how I knew I had the right woman.
[31:23.290 --> 31:24.410]  She's perfect for me.
[31:24.590 --> 31:26.630]  She doesn't care about anybody else's safety either.
[31:27.430 --> 31:28.770]  Okay, so we got MVP sorted.
[31:28.910 --> 31:29.810]  There will be banana wipes.
[31:29.890 --> 31:30.330]  That's brilliant.
[31:30.390 --> 31:31.010]  We got that. Cool.
[31:31.090 --> 31:34.250]  So let's figure out baseballs because we were supposed to do that today and then...
[31:34.250 --> 31:35.550]  When's MVP on my right?
[31:35.970 --> 31:37.810]  Oh, MVP will be...
[31:37.830 --> 31:40.170]  September 23rd at noon, 12 p.m. Central.
[31:40.610 --> 31:41.650]  You can take off your headphones.
[31:44.870 --> 31:46.210]  Andrew, don't say anything funny.
[31:46.210 --> 31:47.650]  You can say whatever you want.
[31:47.790 --> 31:48.450]  What the fuck?
[31:49.190 --> 31:50.810]  He's doing it British style, so it's backwards.
[31:51.330 --> 31:51.730]  Great.
[31:52.130 --> 31:52.930]  It's so confusing.
[31:53.590 --> 31:54.470]  Well, I mean, hang on.
[31:55.450 --> 31:57.550]  How does Canada do the date?
[31:58.270 --> 31:58.830]  Probably like that.
[31:58.870 --> 32:00.050]  I don't know.
[32:00.610 --> 32:01.530]  Hang on.
[32:01.950 --> 32:03.190]  Was your answer, I don't know?
[32:03.410 --> 32:03.750]  What do you mean?
[32:03.750 --> 32:04.570]  Yeah, I never know.
[32:04.750 --> 32:06.650]  Like when you went to school and they taught you.
[32:06.750 --> 32:07.570]  Never filled out a form?
[32:08.230 --> 32:09.990]  Well, no, I never know what to put there.
[32:10.490 --> 32:11.770]  I just do either or.
[32:12.690 --> 32:12.850]  What?
[32:12.850 --> 32:14.210]  I don't know what the standard is.
[32:14.690 --> 32:15.850]  I have no idea.
[32:16.710 --> 32:17.670]  What is the standard?
[32:17.770 --> 32:18.130]  Do you do?
[32:18.410 --> 32:18.970]  I don't know.
[32:19.310 --> 32:19.770]  Let me look.
[32:20.130 --> 32:20.390]  I'll Google.
[32:22.850 --> 32:25.050]  That motherfucker is flummoxed by that.
[32:25.190 --> 32:27.530]  I did not expect that question to break him.
[32:28.070 --> 32:30.010]  Andrew, there's so much we don't know about Andrew.
[32:30.130 --> 32:32.050]  We don't know why he can't come until November.
[32:32.210 --> 32:32.730]  It's mysterious.
[32:32.910 --> 32:34.090]  I don't know why he can't come until November.
[32:34.770 --> 32:35.450]  He doesn't want to.
[32:35.450 --> 32:45.490]  My newest theory is that he's been doing the Halo Infinite weekly challenge every week since the game came out, which was in November.
[32:45.670 --> 32:47.610]  And he's trying to get the full year before he leaves Canada.
[32:48.570 --> 32:48.950]  Interesting.
[32:49.570 --> 32:53.210]  The date can be written either with the day or the month first in Canadian English.
[32:53.710 --> 32:54.930]  Optionally with the day of the week.
[32:55.470 --> 33:01.470]  I feel like Andrew potentially grew up in multiple countries and he's been right at both his entire life.
[33:01.470 --> 33:06.870]  What if one of those creatures in Halo... I can't remember. I'm blanking on the name.
[33:07.810 --> 33:10.390]  One of the big guys you fight with the green...
[33:10.390 --> 33:10.590]  Brutes?
[33:10.590 --> 33:11.370]  Brutes. No.
[33:12.090 --> 33:12.430]  Elites?
[33:12.590 --> 33:12.810]  Hunters?
[33:13.590 --> 33:14.510]  No. Hunters.
[33:14.930 --> 33:19.450]  Hunters are the guys that shoot the green fuel rods at you and you've got to hit them in the back.
[33:19.970 --> 33:20.910]  And they're made of worms.
[33:21.390 --> 33:25.570]  What if Andrew is actually made of worms and he knows he can't get through TSA?
[33:26.170 --> 33:28.270]  There's no way they're going to let a worm body through TSA.
[33:28.910 --> 33:31.070]  I've been there though. I've been in Austin.
[33:31.470 --> 33:31.930]  Several times.
[33:32.070 --> 33:39.470]  It's like that scene in Fifth Element where he's trying to hold in the fact that he's like this big thing and you can see his chin going like...
[33:40.150 --> 33:42.910]  But it's just worms going like...
[33:45.870 --> 33:48.290]  I can't come to America because I'm worms.
[33:51.590 --> 33:52.850]  Because I'm worms.
[33:55.790 --> 33:59.950]  I hate to break it to you guys. I've been trying to hide this for a long time.
[34:02.350 --> 34:04.230]  I'm 98% worm.
[34:04.270 --> 34:05.750]  I'm a hive mind of worms.
[34:09.170 --> 34:11.470]  In high school my nickname was Wormborg.
[34:15.490 --> 34:18.290]  Okay, so we still need to do baseballs.
[34:19.410 --> 34:22.330]  And Andrew still needs to figure out how they write dates in his country.
[34:23.170 --> 34:24.030]  It's both.
[34:24.730 --> 34:26.330]  Andrew, did you not get enough sleep last night?
[34:26.930 --> 34:27.810]  I'm a little tired.
[34:29.130 --> 34:29.650]  I'll sleep.
[34:30.410 --> 34:31.410]  You guys up pretty late playing Halo?
[34:32.150 --> 34:32.330]  No.
[34:34.290 --> 34:35.770]  This might be early for him too.
[34:36.510 --> 34:37.250]  It was two hours earlier.
[34:37.390 --> 34:37.910]  Earlier than normal.
[34:38.770 --> 34:42.910]  What time would you say you wake up on an average day, Andrew? Do you have an alarm? Do you set an alarm to wake up?
[34:43.590 --> 34:47.370]  I have an alarm set for 7.30am. I typically wake up before then.
[34:47.790 --> 34:48.210]  Every day?
[34:48.990 --> 34:49.630]  Not on weekends.
[34:50.570 --> 34:51.950]  What time would you say you get up on the weekends?
[34:52.950 --> 34:55.050]  Probably closer to 9.30am.
[34:55.990 --> 34:56.810]  Around there, yeah.
[34:57.890 --> 34:58.610]  Thrilling conversation.
[34:59.170 --> 35:00.610]  Yeah, I'm going to change it up.
[35:01.170 --> 35:02.790]  Got a response from the merch team.
[35:03.350 --> 35:08.530]  We will change the pages. Size spec will take a while because they are shared specs across brands.
[35:08.650 --> 35:09.730]  So I think that's saying...
[35:09.730 --> 35:10.450]  They'll have to break it out.
[35:10.670 --> 35:10.950]  Yeah, exactly.
[35:11.130 --> 35:12.290]  Yeah, that's fine. It's a little work.
[35:12.330 --> 35:14.810]  We currently have medium listed as M.
[35:15.750 --> 35:19.850]  So do you want it to be XM or spell it out? It should just be XM, right?
[35:19.990 --> 35:20.590]  I guess so.
[35:20.650 --> 35:22.150]  If it's written as M, it should be XM.
[35:22.190 --> 35:22.410]  Yeah.
[35:23.170 --> 35:25.530]  And if it's written out medium, it'll be...
[35:25.530 --> 35:26.210]  Extra medium.
[35:26.210 --> 35:26.730]  Got it.
[35:27.210 --> 35:28.210]  Now, should it be...
[35:28.810 --> 35:29.730]  I'll say that anywhere.
[35:29.730 --> 35:34.510]  Now, should it be written out as E-X-T-R-A medium or X-T-R-A medium?
[35:34.910 --> 35:35.430]  I think with an E.
[35:35.650 --> 35:35.950]  Okay.
[35:36.710 --> 35:38.050]  I mean, that's how you wrote it.
[35:38.250 --> 35:40.650]  Yeah, I'm just thinking like it's a little cooler if you...
[35:40.650 --> 35:41.130]  Extra.
[35:41.870 --> 35:43.410]  Like you would emphasize, punch the X.
[35:44.290 --> 35:46.410]  Like extreme. Extreme medium.
[35:48.270 --> 35:50.430]  Okay, it's happening, I guess.
[35:50.710 --> 35:51.390]  So, baseballs.
[35:52.230 --> 35:52.390]  Okay.
[35:53.070 --> 35:54.230]  Gavin is not around.
[35:56.250 --> 35:56.890]  Starting soon.
[35:57.970 --> 35:58.290]  Okay.
[35:58.510 --> 36:01.110]  Do we wait until after he's back?
[36:01.230 --> 36:02.870]  Do we do it on a week when he's here?
[36:02.970 --> 36:04.830]  Do we do it on our next office meeting?
[36:04.830 --> 36:07.170]  Which would be October, but you have to move it.
[36:07.250 --> 36:08.010]  Here's the question.
[36:08.170 --> 36:08.330]  Yeah.
[36:08.590 --> 36:10.470]  Does the audience even remember?
[36:11.210 --> 36:12.950]  Oh, I think there are people who want baseballs.
[36:13.010 --> 36:14.630]  Okay, so we need to... so probably sooner than later.
[36:15.690 --> 36:16.010]  Yeah.
[36:16.310 --> 36:16.690]  All right.
[36:16.890 --> 36:16.930]  Yeah.
[36:17.830 --> 36:20.110]  And we just need to do exactly what we did last time?
[36:20.250 --> 36:21.090]  Yeah, we just gotta hit baseballs.
[36:21.090 --> 36:25.470]  How do we get it so that more people can screen match their baseballs?
[36:25.530 --> 36:27.370]  Because I thought it was really cool that the guy...
[36:27.370 --> 36:27.770]  Screen matched?
[36:27.950 --> 36:29.250]  ...found his baseball in the video.
[36:29.270 --> 36:30.450]  Did you do it with giant hands?
[36:31.170 --> 36:31.410]  Yeah.
[36:31.630 --> 36:32.450]  Yeah, those were huge.
[36:32.530 --> 36:33.090]  Huge hands.
[36:33.090 --> 36:33.510]  It was pretty cool.
[36:34.650 --> 36:35.250]  Massive hands.
[36:35.330 --> 36:37.930]  So do you want to be there to take pictures of every ball that's hit or what?
[36:38.110 --> 36:38.470]  I don't know.
[36:38.550 --> 36:40.250]  I kind of don't want to make another video.
[36:40.430 --> 36:40.730]  Right.
[36:41.390 --> 36:44.190]  Which is more sounding like something that we should have done in the first video.
[36:44.210 --> 36:44.410]  Right, right.
[36:44.470 --> 36:48.410]  Which is something that you just walked yourself backwards into by going, here's some ideas.
[36:48.530 --> 36:49.150]  I don't want to do that.
[36:50.490 --> 36:58.130]  What if we get somebody to just take a still photo of every ball after it's been hit?
[36:58.250 --> 37:00.330]  Right, that's why I was saying if Gavin was going to do that.
[37:00.470 --> 37:01.470]  Yeah, but we're talking video.
[37:01.910 --> 37:06.550]  And then we just put up a page of just all the photos, and then you can go see if you can find your ball.
[37:07.250 --> 37:08.230]  Well, I mean, you'll have your ball.
[37:08.810 --> 37:09.930]  Yeah, but you'll see if you can find your ball.
[37:10.050 --> 37:12.590]  My ball is number 62 on the wall of ball.
[37:12.650 --> 37:13.110]  On the ball wall.
[37:14.310 --> 37:14.870]  Ball wall?
[37:15.350 --> 37:15.770]  Ball wall.
[37:15.810 --> 37:16.570]  I like the ball wall.
[37:16.930 --> 37:17.470]  I like the ball wall.
[37:18.010 --> 37:18.210]  Yeah.
[37:19.230 --> 37:20.430]  So when are we going to hit these?
[37:21.070 --> 37:21.570]  Oh, yeah.
[37:24.930 --> 37:29.750]  So everyone at home understands, this is typically how it goes, where it's, here's one idea.
[37:29.950 --> 37:31.470]  All right, here's four more ideas on top.
[37:32.970 --> 37:33.290]  When?
[37:33.930 --> 37:34.610]  Oh, right.
[37:34.890 --> 37:36.210]  How about...
[37:36.810 --> 37:39.530]  Man, this Uno Infinite stream is really fucking my life up.
[37:39.590 --> 37:41.510]  Yeah, I know, because that's the day we were supposed to do the monkey thing.
[37:41.750 --> 37:41.970]  Yeah.
[37:42.110 --> 37:45.050]  And then it's a day where you go, oh, we could have done the baseball.
[37:45.190 --> 37:45.650]  When is that?
[37:45.790 --> 37:46.130]  The ninth.
[37:46.130 --> 37:51.310]  And then I also had the idea, I presented it to Emily yesterday, I was like, what if we just go to Michigan for the weekend?
[37:51.450 --> 37:51.530]  Yeah.
[37:51.610 --> 37:54.310]  And just drive around and look at houses and try to find a town to buy a house in.
[37:54.590 --> 37:56.150]  And she goes, aren't you doing that Uno thing?
[37:56.190 --> 37:57.030]  And I was like, god damn it!
[37:57.110 --> 37:57.230]  Yeah.
[37:57.710 --> 37:57.950]  Yeah.
[37:58.990 --> 37:59.530]  You're leaving?
[38:00.470 --> 38:00.650]  Huh?
[38:00.850 --> 38:01.170]  You're leaving?
[38:02.110 --> 38:02.610]  Vacation home.
[38:02.730 --> 38:02.870]  Oh.
[38:03.050 --> 38:03.490]  I'm not...
[38:03.490 --> 38:04.710]  I told you, if I...
[38:04.710 --> 38:06.410]  Listen, we discussed this at dinner.
[38:06.990 --> 38:07.170]  Yeah.
[38:07.690 --> 38:08.510]  Dinner he was at?
[38:08.830 --> 38:14.490]  Yeah, anywhere I move, you will be taken into consideration and we will move together.
[38:14.730 --> 38:14.890]  Okay.
[38:14.890 --> 38:16.330]  Because you're the only reason I'm still here.
[38:16.370 --> 38:17.750]  You're the only reason I'm still here.
[38:17.970 --> 38:18.630]  I get it.
[38:18.690 --> 38:19.610]  Believe me, dude.
[38:19.710 --> 38:21.590]  You and Millie are the only reasons I'm still in Texas.
[38:23.130 --> 38:24.250]  We will move together.
[38:25.190 --> 38:26.050]  And I will find a...
[38:26.050 --> 38:27.310]  And I won't...
[38:27.310 --> 38:31.550]  Also, dude, I won't buy the house without getting your okay first to make sure that you're okay with the town.
[38:31.550 --> 38:33.710]  I just need to make sure that my car looks good at that house.
[38:33.730 --> 38:33.870]  Yeah.
[38:34.170 --> 38:34.870]  No, I don't want to...
[38:34.870 --> 38:36.450]  How do you think it looks right now?
[38:36.510 --> 38:37.810]  The back end not so good or what?
[38:38.110 --> 38:38.970]  I'm trying...
[38:38.970 --> 38:39.850]  It looks like shit right now.
[38:39.850 --> 38:47.970]  I'm trying to find the perfect place for us to move into the next phase of our life together based on the conversations that we've had.
[38:48.130 --> 38:48.350]  Uh-huh.
[38:48.590 --> 38:48.850]  Okay?
[38:49.050 --> 38:49.210]  Yeah.
[38:49.410 --> 38:49.910]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:49.910 --> 38:51.730]  But that none of that...
[38:51.730 --> 38:54.570]  None of that, by the way, precludes our ability to do this podcast.
[38:54.850 --> 38:54.970]  Right.
[38:55.030 --> 38:55.870]  And it's not going to happen tomorrow.
[38:55.990 --> 39:03.330]  And when it does, it'll be a vacation home until eventually we retire and have our old days together.
[39:03.370 --> 39:03.810]  Hey, Andrew?
[39:04.290 --> 39:04.690]  Yeah?
[39:05.050 --> 39:06.630]  When do you think we're going to hit the baseballs?
[39:07.130 --> 39:08.630]  I don't know when we'll hit the baseballs.
[39:08.630 --> 39:09.150]  I'm just...
[39:09.150 --> 39:11.310]  I'm more focused on if they move by November.
[39:11.550 --> 39:13.770]  It is not my fault if I never end up in Texas.
[39:14.010 --> 39:14.990]  I just want that known.
[39:16.850 --> 39:18.230]  That is no longer on me.
[39:18.250 --> 39:20.150]  Much like Vegas, not my fault.
[39:20.270 --> 39:20.890]  That is true.
[39:21.090 --> 39:22.190]  I will say that is true.
[39:22.690 --> 39:26.330]  We're not hitting the baseballs before Gavin leaves, I don't think.
[39:26.410 --> 39:28.050]  Well, yeah, I would think so.
[39:28.710 --> 39:29.770]  So we'll have to do it...
[39:30.170 --> 39:32.910]  Are we doing a podcast on Thursday?
[39:33.450 --> 39:33.650]  Yeah.
[39:34.070 --> 39:35.290]  I mean, are we?
[39:35.330 --> 39:36.450]  This coming Thursday?
[39:36.770 --> 39:37.210]  The 8th?
[39:37.550 --> 39:37.730]  Yeah.
[39:37.730 --> 39:38.090]  Thursday?
[39:38.630 --> 39:39.370]  Why would we not?
[39:40.910 --> 39:41.570]  Oh, I can't.
[39:41.850 --> 39:42.690]  Wait, the 8th?
[39:43.190 --> 39:43.770]  No, no, I'm good.
[39:44.590 --> 39:45.050]  I can't...
[39:45.050 --> 39:45.470]  Jesus.
[39:45.730 --> 39:46.410]  No, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[39:46.510 --> 39:46.890]  Eric, look.
[39:47.030 --> 39:47.870]  I was in the wrong week.
[39:48.270 --> 39:48.830]  No, no, Eric, look.
[39:48.890 --> 39:49.010]  Why?
[39:49.030 --> 39:49.830]  Because I had...
[39:49.830 --> 39:50.570]  I had...
[39:50.570 --> 39:51.290]  But that's on...
[39:51.290 --> 39:51.990]  Gavin's out of town.
[39:52.070 --> 39:53.490]  Hey, hey, Geoff.
[39:53.710 --> 39:54.470]  No, you don't.
[39:56.090 --> 39:56.310]  What?
[39:56.670 --> 39:57.530]  You don't have...
[39:58.270 --> 39:59.150]  Oh, you're right.
[39:59.250 --> 39:59.850]  Yeah, I know.
[40:00.310 --> 40:00.750]  I forgot.
[40:00.950 --> 40:01.870]  We were holding off on that.
[40:02.010 --> 40:02.310]  Oh.
[40:02.990 --> 40:03.450]  Well, okay.
[40:03.550 --> 40:04.110]  We can cut that.
[40:05.370 --> 40:05.810]  Yeah, no.
[40:05.810 --> 40:07.110]  It turns out I'm clear on the 15th.
[40:07.110 --> 40:08.010]  Yeah, it turns out.
[40:10.270 --> 40:11.210]  Dude, what a relief.
[40:11.450 --> 40:12.510]  That shit was...
[40:12.510 --> 40:13.030]  Oh, man.
[40:13.030 --> 40:14.550]  ...heavy on my calendar that week.
[40:14.630 --> 40:15.270]  Oh, man.
[40:16.010 --> 40:17.490]  That makes my life way easier.
[40:17.570 --> 40:19.010]  It probably makes some other people's lives way harder.
[40:19.150 --> 40:20.710]  I mean, we could hit him on the 15th.
[40:20.790 --> 40:21.030]  Oh, no.
[40:21.070 --> 40:21.550]  Why don't we just hit him...
[40:21.550 --> 40:21.850]  There's no gap.
[40:21.850 --> 40:22.710]  We can't do an episode.
[40:22.770 --> 40:24.050]  Why don't we just hit him before the episode?
[40:24.710 --> 40:25.690]  You're not here on the 15th.
[40:25.850 --> 40:26.130]  No.
[40:26.230 --> 40:26.430]  On the 8th.
[40:26.430 --> 40:27.030]  Well, the 8th.
[40:27.030 --> 40:27.690]  On the 8th.
[40:27.850 --> 40:28.130]  Episode.
[40:29.370 --> 40:29.930]  Uh, yeah.
[40:30.670 --> 40:31.070]  I mean, you...
[40:31.070 --> 40:31.510]  Can we do it in the morning?
[40:31.590 --> 40:34.350]  I have to do the...
[40:35.410 --> 40:38.650]  So we're gonna squeeze it in in the morning on the 8th?
[40:38.710 --> 40:39.070]  Yeah, okay.
[40:39.330 --> 40:41.110]  From, what, 10 to noon, I guess?
[40:41.270 --> 40:41.970]  Try to get it there?
[40:42.150 --> 40:42.390]  Yeah.
[40:42.870 --> 40:43.810]  That sounds great to me.
[40:44.150 --> 40:44.670]  It does?
[40:44.790 --> 40:45.150]  That works.
[40:45.530 --> 40:46.430]  Yeah, it works for Andrew.
[40:46.630 --> 40:47.530]  Oh, cool. It works for...
[40:47.530 --> 40:47.890]  Thanks, Andrew.
[40:48.570 --> 40:49.210]  You're welcome.
[40:49.630 --> 40:50.210]  Appreciate it, man.
[40:50.430 --> 40:51.490]  I can even do nine.
[40:51.530 --> 40:54.810]  Do you think we could hook up a button that Andrew can press in Canada
[40:54.810 --> 40:56.890]  that swings a baseball bat in Texas?
[40:57.950 --> 40:59.390]  Get Marcus to make...
[40:59.390 --> 41:01.090]  That technology has to exist.
[41:01.410 --> 41:03.130]  I mean, it's just...
[41:03.130 --> 41:06.150]  A computer hooked up to a solenoid or something.
[41:08.270 --> 41:09.430]  That could be made.
[41:10.990 --> 41:15.200]  Hitting baseballs, adding Geoff, adding Gavin, adding Nick.
[41:17.490 --> 41:19.730]  I'll see who else wants to come and hit, like, catch him.
[41:20.110 --> 41:21.090]  Yeah, there you go.
[41:21.310 --> 41:22.010]  All right, there he is.
[41:22.030 --> 41:23.210]  Invite Jack so he can show up halfway through.
[41:24.590 --> 41:27.550]  Not even worth the time to go back in and invite him.
[41:28.030 --> 41:35.730]  Okay, so when you guys hear this, I'm sure that by the time this comes out, it will have been past the 8th.
[41:36.650 --> 41:41.050]  So just know that it probably moved and we didn't hit the baseballs on the 8th.
[41:41.370 --> 41:48.110]  I was about to say, I'd love to know how many of these things actually happened by the time we do the next office day.
[41:48.310 --> 41:52.850]  I'm so excited for Geoff to go like, guess what? My tooth fell out. It did happen.
[41:53.070 --> 41:54.670]  No, my tooth falls out. I'm walking away.
[41:54.850 --> 41:55.870]  He's walking away.
[41:55.870 --> 41:58.150]  You won't see Geoff anymore.
[41:59.890 --> 42:01.650]  September 8th, 10am.
[42:02.490 --> 42:05.030]  Dude, we're blowing through this office day. This is awesome.
[42:05.830 --> 42:09.890]  Look at all the work we're doing. Look at all the work we're scheduling to do in the future that we're not doing today.
[42:10.190 --> 42:12.690]  That we're probably also not doing in the future.
[42:13.010 --> 42:16.850]  Oh, we'll do it in the future. It may not be that future, but it'll be an A future.
[42:16.970 --> 42:17.890]  Jesus Christ.
[42:17.890 --> 42:27.370]  Do you think there's an alternate dimension, like an alternate universe, where we're really, really, like, just fucking gung-ho and successful and f*** face.
[42:27.610 --> 42:31.270]  And we just, we make tons of stuff and we meet all of our deadlines and we...
[42:31.910 --> 42:33.350]  Yes, there has to be.
[42:33.570 --> 42:34.370]  Infinite possibilities?
[42:34.670 --> 42:35.030]  Yeah, for sure.
[42:35.650 --> 42:38.410]  And that universe I only have upper body injuries.
[42:41.290 --> 42:43.930]  His wrists, his shoulders are f***ed.
[42:44.110 --> 42:45.590]  He's got a lifetime of nipple problems.
[42:49.450 --> 42:52.130]  He's like, I can't record today, guys, my wrists and nipples are acting up.
[42:53.190 --> 42:56.090]  Okay, do we want to come up with ideas for this sock thing?
[42:56.390 --> 42:56.750]  Yes.
[42:56.810 --> 43:03.470]  Because here's the thing, the socks we've seen, the cursed socks, which we will be cursing, well, not we, Gavin will be cursing live.
[43:03.670 --> 43:06.830]  And we just came up with changing them both to also be left socks.
[43:07.270 --> 43:07.630]  Yes.
[43:07.950 --> 43:08.590]  I mean, I think that's...
[43:08.590 --> 43:11.710]  To try and pull old jokes back into the present.
[43:11.810 --> 43:12.170]  Correct.
[43:12.930 --> 43:20.230]  I would like to see one product, one day, that's like the... what is it? Katamari... how do you say that?
[43:20.290 --> 43:20.450]  Katamari?
[43:20.730 --> 43:21.590]  Katamari, yeah.
[43:22.390 --> 43:23.390]  Katamari, like the boat?
[43:23.690 --> 43:28.550]  No, the Katamari, yeah. No, Katamari Dynasty or whatever, the ball that you roll out of...
[43:28.550 --> 43:29.450]  Katamari Damacy, yeah.
[43:29.470 --> 43:30.450]  Katamari Damacy, thank you.
[43:31.030 --> 43:35.650]  That's just like the Katamari Damacy of all of our jokes wrapped up into one dumb ball.
[43:35.650 --> 43:35.870]  Big ball.
[43:36.090 --> 43:36.290]  Yeah.
[43:36.590 --> 43:37.330]  And we'll put it on the bull.
[43:37.490 --> 43:37.970]  Pretty good.
[43:37.970 --> 43:40.510]  I forgot about the ball wall, we didn't write that down.
[43:43.450 --> 43:50.410]  Okay, so we don't know when the socks are actually coming out, but...
[43:50.410 --> 43:50.810]  Close.
[43:51.110 --> 43:52.290]  We do have...
[43:52.290 --> 43:53.610]  Am I doing it as a live stream?
[43:53.750 --> 43:59.590]  Yes, it will be a live stream, either half an hour or an hour, I think we'll kind of have carte blanche to kind of do whatever we want to...
[43:59.590 --> 44:06.250]  And will I just have my own sort of mystic area of the set and then you other guys are going to be filling time while I'm cursing?
[44:06.250 --> 44:17.090]  I think we can... I think that was the initial pitch, was I thought while you had your little voodoo area, or wherever, where you're doing your cursings, and then we're off on the other side, like on the main stage.
[44:17.530 --> 44:23.570]  And in my head, we would be selling Switch Flux, but I don't think those are going to be ready anytime soon.
[44:24.450 --> 44:28.390]  But, here's the thing. Is this where we incorporate the tuxedo?
[44:28.710 --> 44:29.130]  Yes.
[44:29.150 --> 44:31.550]  Because we don't have any tuxedo stuff right now.
[44:32.390 --> 44:35.450]  Are you wearing the tuxedo while you curse these socks?
[44:36.170 --> 44:39.390]  Well, we were going to do the poster with the tuxedo, right? We were going to recreate that.
[44:39.410 --> 44:39.910]  Right, right.
[44:40.350 --> 44:42.350]  Maybe we'll sell those posters too.
[44:42.550 --> 44:43.930]  Okay, I can see about getting that.
[44:44.070 --> 44:48.210]  If I'm in curse mode, I should be wearing some sort of cloak with a high collar.
[44:48.590 --> 44:48.870]  I agree.
[44:49.730 --> 44:51.090]  So, not the tuxedo?
[44:51.590 --> 44:53.630]  I think we get a mannequin.
[44:53.830 --> 44:56.850]  I should look like Solitaire in Live and Let Die. Have you seen that film?
[44:56.950 --> 44:57.270]  Yes.
[44:57.410 --> 44:58.050]  Yeah, I should wear that.
[44:58.130 --> 44:58.310]  Okay.
[44:59.470 --> 45:00.890]  I love that idea.
[45:01.230 --> 45:02.090]  Jane Seymour.
[45:04.530 --> 45:09.590]  Dr. Quinn, I think that we should get a mannequin.
[45:10.210 --> 45:10.330]  Okay.
[45:10.510 --> 45:13.330]  And that we should put the tuxedo on the mannequin.
[45:13.610 --> 45:17.610]  And then, I was thinking we put it in storage or somewhere after that.
[45:17.650 --> 45:23.110]  But, maybe the tuxedo on the mannequin is just like the silent member of F*** Face.
[45:23.210 --> 45:26.930]  And anytime we have a video, anytime we record a video, it's somewhere in the background.
[45:27.090 --> 45:27.330]  Okay.
[45:27.330 --> 45:28.650]  Just like watching over.
[45:28.790 --> 45:29.070]  Okay.
[45:29.270 --> 45:30.950]  So, we need a tuxedo for the mannequin.
[45:31.330 --> 45:32.410]  We need a mannequin for the tuxedo.
[45:32.750 --> 45:33.010]  Sorry.
[45:33.150 --> 45:33.350]  Yeah.
[45:33.470 --> 45:35.290]  We have the tuxedo, we need the mannequin.
[45:35.470 --> 45:36.170]  Are you tired already?
[45:36.750 --> 45:38.050]  No, I'm just thinking ahead.
[45:38.050 --> 45:39.090]  It's a lot for your brain, I know.
[45:39.230 --> 45:44.970]  I'm thinking ahead at what that means logistically for not just the mannequin, but for the stream.
[45:45.370 --> 45:51.530]  And then, being able to keep the mannequin on hand for when we want to shoot stuff.
[45:51.730 --> 45:53.010]  Because it's never...
[45:53.010 --> 45:53.890]  No, I got it.
[45:54.850 --> 45:57.010]  The whole time we were talking and figuring that out.
[45:57.010 --> 45:57.710]  Gavin's looking at pictures.
[45:57.730 --> 45:58.490]  Gavin was looking at pictures.
[45:58.910 --> 46:00.190]  I was like, that didn't disappoint.
[46:00.470 --> 46:01.210]  No, I got it.
[46:02.430 --> 46:05.630]  I'm just thinking, because the things that happen here are sudden, I feel like.
[46:05.690 --> 46:07.570]  So, I want to make sure that we can have it on hand.
[46:07.630 --> 46:07.850]  Yeah.
[46:07.990 --> 46:10.450]  So, I can keep it in my office kind of...
[46:10.450 --> 46:11.090]  Like, on handicap.
[46:12.190 --> 46:12.510]  Yep.
[46:14.330 --> 46:14.650]  So...
[46:14.650 --> 46:17.230]  Should we have a physical museum here at some point?
[46:17.350 --> 46:17.590]  Yes.
[46:17.710 --> 46:18.610]  Yeah, I think we have to.
[46:18.770 --> 46:20.050]  Yeah, Ripken's...
[46:20.050 --> 46:20.770]  Believe it, because why not?
[46:20.890 --> 46:21.070]  Yeah.
[46:21.190 --> 46:22.210]  But, like, how?
[46:22.530 --> 46:23.130]  Like, that...
[46:23.650 --> 46:25.310]  We keep saying, yeah, we'll do a museum.
[46:25.310 --> 46:28.850]  And it's like, I don't even know logistically how to begin to do that.
[46:30.090 --> 46:31.530]  Yeah, it feels very much like an RTX idea.
[46:31.530 --> 46:33.030]  Plastic cases around a bunch of shit.
[46:35.650 --> 46:38.950]  Like, you walk into a room and you just see, like, a nice plastic cube.
[46:38.950 --> 46:39.070]  Right.
[46:39.130 --> 46:40.510]  And a nice Thrice to Meet you.
[46:40.590 --> 46:41.130]  But you're right.
[46:41.230 --> 46:45.470]  Your idea is just to have this and that's it.
[46:45.830 --> 46:50.490]  I love the idea of the stuff we talk about causing, like, a rent payment.
[46:50.790 --> 46:54.030]  Like, you have to store it and it's, like, inconvenient for the rest of the company.
[46:54.030 --> 46:57.750]  And it's like, oh, you go, we're not paying to keep this stuff in boxes.
[46:58.410 --> 46:59.510]  I do like that idea, too.
[47:00.470 --> 47:00.810]  I do.
[47:03.430 --> 47:05.610]  Okay, so you're gonna be dressed like a Bond villain.
[47:05.770 --> 47:08.210]  You want to curse the socks.
[47:08.670 --> 47:09.250]  She's not a villain.
[47:10.310 --> 47:12.630]  And then the tuxedo's on a mannequin.
[47:13.090 --> 47:15.810]  And then we're selling it, huh?
[47:15.870 --> 47:17.490]  We just sell f*** face stuff.
[47:17.610 --> 47:20.350]  Like, whatever we have in the store at the time.
[47:20.510 --> 47:23.530]  And then just, like, putting on a show, talking, doing a little banter, you know?
[47:23.530 --> 47:25.690]  Andrew, you'll be pipped in for that?
[47:25.830 --> 47:26.250]  You're good with that?
[47:26.390 --> 47:27.250]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[47:27.630 --> 47:30.350]  Yeah, maybe you could throw it to me if you want to find out about the current curse.
[47:30.550 --> 47:33.430]  Okay, so what if Andrew is there?
[47:35.170 --> 47:39.970]  Geoff, you and I are on the one side and we're selling this stuff or whatever.
[47:40.570 --> 47:44.150]  And then Gavin, dressed like Solitaire, is cursing the socks.
[47:44.350 --> 47:48.050]  But then there's also the monitor looming over him and it's Andrew.
[47:48.330 --> 47:52.530]  And Andrew is there to, like, keep an eye on this curse.
[47:52.530 --> 47:55.610]  To make sure that, like, all these curses are occurring, okay?
[47:56.210 --> 47:57.230]  Geoff got excited.
[47:57.550 --> 47:58.270]  I have an idea.
[47:58.390 --> 47:58.670]  Okay.
[47:58.850 --> 48:00.630]  I don't know how hard this would be to pull off.
[48:01.910 --> 48:03.990]  What that means is really f***ing hard.
[48:04.250 --> 48:07.530]  What if Andrew appeared in a crystal ball?
[48:10.830 --> 48:11.270]  Okay.
[48:12.070 --> 48:12.510]  Right?
[48:13.610 --> 48:15.370]  He's just, like, in the crystal ball watching.
[48:15.970 --> 48:20.450]  We can try... I don't know what our crystal ball technology is.
[48:20.450 --> 48:22.610]  Surely that exists on Google.
[48:22.930 --> 48:25.150]  I should be able to buy something on Amazon.
[48:25.470 --> 48:28.790]  What was the name of that guy in Power Rangers who was in the tube?
[48:29.070 --> 48:29.330]  Zordon.
[48:30.070 --> 48:31.710]  It looked like that.
[48:32.770 --> 48:35.670]  Like, his mouth is all morphed for budget reasons.
[48:35.810 --> 48:40.530]  What do you... what would you call what we're looking for so I can see if it exists?
[48:40.850 --> 48:42.450]  Crystal ball...
[48:44.770 --> 48:45.930]  Novel... projectable...
[48:45.930 --> 48:47.070]  Projectable.
[48:47.770 --> 48:48.350]  Pro...
[48:48.350 --> 48:49.990]  Crystal ball projection?
[48:50.410 --> 48:51.610]  LCD crystal ball.
[48:53.410 --> 48:54.710]  Photo... crystal ball photo.
[48:55.110 --> 48:56.250]  Just add play to it.
[48:56.450 --> 48:56.630]  Yep.
[48:57.630 --> 48:59.170]  Easy crystal ball illusion.
[48:59.530 --> 49:03.970]  How to easy crystal ball illusion using a projector and hololusion.
[49:04.250 --> 49:04.690]  No thanks.
[49:07.130 --> 49:10.070]  Like, we just need Andrew in a crystal ball.
[49:11.990 --> 49:14.890]  Great. It's a great idea. I really do like it.
[49:16.810 --> 49:19.290]  Geoff's listening to spooky haunted music.
[49:19.310 --> 49:21.210]  Look at the crystal balls.
[49:22.710 --> 49:23.670]  Did you figure it out?
[49:23.750 --> 49:26.730]  No, but we can at least talk to Marcus. I'm sure he knows how to do it.
[49:27.450 --> 49:27.630]  Okay.
[49:28.550 --> 49:30.530]  Fans create clever and easy crystal ball...
[49:30.530 --> 49:33.570]  Alright, listen, I'll do some work on this on the weekend.
[49:33.830 --> 49:35.090]  I'll look and see what I can find.
[49:35.110 --> 49:37.510]  I mean, we have time because we don't even have the fucking socks yet.
[49:37.550 --> 49:38.390]  Yeah, we don't have the socks yet.
[49:38.650 --> 49:40.650]  I think Andrew should be barely recognizable.
[49:40.710 --> 49:41.410]  Yes, I agree.
[49:41.410 --> 49:45.670]  I think it needs to be a small crystal ball that is just like...
[49:45.670 --> 49:47.770]  That's fun for us when people go...
[49:47.770 --> 49:50.290]  Oh, did you know that Andrew was in the crystal ball?
[49:50.470 --> 49:53.190]  It's like nobody understands or gets it or sees it that well.
[49:53.310 --> 49:53.750]  Great.
[49:54.410 --> 49:57.890]  But I like the idea of splitting it where you and I are...
[49:57.890 --> 50:00.410]  We're trying to like sell this stuff and then Gavin and Andrew...
[50:03.370 --> 50:05.630]  Are performing some kind of ritual.
[50:06.770 --> 50:09.270]  And they're doing some spooky stuff on the other side.
[50:10.690 --> 50:14.550]  It would be good if we had a product to sell on our end.
[50:15.110 --> 50:15.190]  Yeah.
[50:15.290 --> 50:16.390]  Like the poster or whatever.
[50:16.530 --> 50:18.690]  But even if it's just like generic f***face stuff, we can do that.
[50:18.750 --> 50:20.210]  Maybe we can clear out the warehouse or something.
[50:20.210 --> 50:21.670]  Like we did with the Geoff stuff.
[50:21.750 --> 50:22.970]  Yeah, we did that with FaceJam too.
[50:23.010 --> 50:23.970]  Should we also...
[50:23.970 --> 50:28.050]  Because I know when we did the signing of the cards, we split it so that...
[50:28.050 --> 50:30.710]  You know, you did most and I did some and Andrew did like one.
[50:30.890 --> 50:31.090]  Yeah.
[50:31.390 --> 50:32.710]  Do you guys want to come in and curse?
[50:33.630 --> 50:34.730]  No, because I feel like...
[50:34.730 --> 50:37.250]  We don't have any curse powers.
[50:37.810 --> 50:39.030]  I mean, I would like to...
[50:39.030 --> 50:40.490]  But I just don't think...
[50:40.490 --> 50:42.650]  I mean, I think it would ruin the efficacy of the curse.
[50:42.910 --> 50:42.950]  Right.
[50:43.130 --> 50:45.230]  Maybe it will make them really good luck socks though.
[50:45.730 --> 50:46.510]  That's not what we're selling.
[50:46.750 --> 50:46.970]  Yeah.
[50:47.190 --> 50:47.750]  That's a good point.
[50:49.490 --> 50:52.390]  I mean, I guess we can sell good luck socks later.
[50:52.610 --> 50:54.530]  You got to remember how the universe works, right?
[50:55.530 --> 50:56.830]  Equal and opposite reactions.
[50:57.010 --> 50:57.130]  Yeah.
[50:57.210 --> 50:58.710]  So if you have...
[50:58.710 --> 50:59.930]  You're cursing socks.
[51:00.310 --> 51:02.310]  Those socks are very unlucky to somebody.
[51:02.730 --> 51:07.030]  But because of that unluck, somebody else gets extra luck.
[51:07.030 --> 51:09.770]  So those socks are lucky to somebody else in the universe.
[51:10.010 --> 51:10.750]  They're just not wearing them.
[51:10.850 --> 51:12.570]  That person's enemy or whatever, you know?
[51:13.090 --> 51:13.850]  Like, their day got better.
[51:13.910 --> 51:17.610]  They don't know exactly how, but because their enemy put on curse socks.
[51:17.730 --> 51:19.510]  It's like the editor of someone winning the lottery and thinking,
[51:19.690 --> 51:21.790]  uh, someone else is wearing some unlucky socks today.
[51:22.010 --> 51:22.450]  Yeah, probably.
[51:23.750 --> 51:27.470]  Now, I had written up there...
[51:28.030 --> 51:30.690]  I wrote influencers in quotes because I hate that word.
[51:30.930 --> 51:33.570]  But are there people we want to gift the socks to?
[51:34.370 --> 51:35.250]  Cursed socks?
[51:35.250 --> 51:38.910]  Like, anybody out there in the world that you like or don't like,
[51:38.950 --> 51:40.890]  that you want to, like, send a free pair of socks to?
[51:41.050 --> 51:42.650]  As like a...
[51:42.650 --> 51:45.650]  Not even like the f*** face apology basket, just like as a gift from f*** face?
[51:47.030 --> 51:50.030]  We should... I mean, as long as there's a disclaimer saying that they are actually cursed.
[51:50.230 --> 51:50.910]  Well, it's all over the socks.
[51:50.950 --> 51:52.310]  It's all over the box, yeah.
[51:52.630 --> 51:54.070]  I mean, they are cursed socks.
[51:54.110 --> 51:57.390]  Are we doing the wallet card just in case they die, or are we not doing that?
[51:58.490 --> 51:58.810]  Tough.
[51:59.730 --> 52:00.030]  We should.
[52:00.830 --> 52:01.190]  Who...
[52:01.190 --> 52:02.570]  Like, who is...
[52:02.570 --> 52:06.670]  Who would we want to gift a pair of socks that say f*** you to?
[52:06.870 --> 52:08.330]  Who would appreciate?
[52:12.530 --> 52:13.170]  Kinda funny?
[52:13.490 --> 52:14.750]  Kinda funny would be good.
[52:15.090 --> 52:17.190]  Rocco from Mega64 is a big sock guy.
[52:17.510 --> 52:18.010]  Oh, is he?
[52:18.070 --> 52:19.330]  Yeah, he's got like...
[52:19.330 --> 52:21.630]  He loves like Pizza Hut socks and all kinds of crazy s***.
[52:21.650 --> 52:23.150]  Oh, yeah, we could send Rocco a pair of socks.
[52:23.250 --> 52:25.290]  I think socks that say f*** you and they're cursed.
[52:25.490 --> 52:26.010]  He already...
[52:26.010 --> 52:28.850]  And also, I'll be honest with you, he seems like a guy who's already been cursed a few times.
[52:28.850 --> 52:30.570]  Yeah, you know, so like the socks maybe...
[52:30.570 --> 52:32.850]  Maybe there's sort of like a double negative situation where...
[52:32.850 --> 52:32.870]  Yeah.
[52:32.870 --> 52:33.870]  Yeah, you know?
[52:34.290 --> 52:37.010]  Like, and even if it's not, like, that's a great example of like...
[52:37.550 --> 52:39.070]  Rocco puts on cursed socks.
[52:39.170 --> 52:39.290]  Yeah.
[52:39.390 --> 52:40.390]  I bet Sean's life gets better.
[52:40.470 --> 52:41.550]  Yeah, it could be that.
[52:41.890 --> 52:42.910]  You think we should send them to Ray?
[52:44.430 --> 52:48.310]  We just send Ray a pair of socks that say f*** you.
[52:49.310 --> 52:55.350]  If you wanted to have somebody have the bare minimum reaction to a joke, I think Ray's definitely the person.
[52:56.050 --> 52:56.670]  Oh, socks.
[52:56.890 --> 52:57.150]  Sweet.
[52:58.930 --> 53:00.790]  Oh, you want me to tweet about it?
[53:04.810 --> 53:05.130]  Socks.
[53:06.770 --> 53:08.210]  Those are all really good Ray impressions.
[53:09.130 --> 53:10.350]  Yeah, let's send them to Ray.
[53:13.450 --> 53:16.350]  It's so weird that we only worked with Ray for like two and a half years.
[53:16.510 --> 53:17.550]  It feels like so much longer.
[53:18.470 --> 53:21.930]  I guess I worked with him for a little bit longer because he was like a stringer, you know?
[53:22.150 --> 53:22.290]  Yeah.
[53:22.290 --> 53:22.970]  Before he came in.
[53:23.150 --> 53:24.410]  But like, face to face.
[53:24.450 --> 53:27.090]  Was it really that... two and a half years?
[53:27.250 --> 53:28.170]  Maybe it was three and a half?
[53:28.170 --> 53:29.090]  No, no, no.
[53:29.110 --> 53:31.090]  It was a f***ing thousand years ago, I don't know that.
[53:31.450 --> 53:32.950]  Yeah, it feels a lot longer than it was.
[53:33.030 --> 53:33.490]  Yeah, it does.
[53:33.730 --> 53:35.530]  Well, he left an indelible mark on our hearts.
[53:35.690 --> 53:35.930]  Mm-hmm.
[53:36.190 --> 53:36.370]  Yeah.
[53:36.870 --> 53:40.450]  Okay, we'll start looking for a list of influencers that we can send these to.
[53:40.450 --> 53:42.030]  Just somebody who, like, I don't know.
[53:42.350 --> 53:45.970]  But I just thought, like, somebody who might get the joke or appreciate it or think it's funny.
[53:46.390 --> 53:48.030]  Or be horribly offended.
[53:48.310 --> 53:50.030]  Kevin Donovan would be a bad choice.
[53:50.810 --> 53:52.290]  Not that I could get the information.
[53:52.550 --> 53:53.710]  I don't think that would play.
[53:54.870 --> 53:57.550]  So did you already send the email that says, hey, where do you live?
[53:58.170 --> 53:58.350]  Oh!
[54:02.410 --> 54:03.910]  Hey, Kevin, tuxedo guy here.
[54:04.110 --> 54:04.850]  Need your address.
[54:04.990 --> 54:06.790]  Want to send you a pair of socks and say, f*** off.
[54:07.570 --> 54:08.270]  Big fan.
[54:09.350 --> 54:12.350]  Okay, well, we'll start making a list and see who else we can...
[54:12.350 --> 54:12.990]  Just an idea.
[54:13.150 --> 54:14.070]  Yeah, a little bit of outreach.
[54:14.110 --> 54:15.010]  A little cursed outreach.
[54:15.050 --> 54:15.750]  Yeah, I like it.
[54:16.330 --> 54:17.550]  Are you making a list?
[54:17.650 --> 54:18.170]  He's going down the list.
[54:18.990 --> 54:19.750]  Keeping the minutes.
[54:20.270 --> 54:20.530]  Okay.
[54:21.470 --> 54:22.190]  I feel like...
[54:22.930 --> 54:26.990]  We said kind of funny, but I think, like, specifically if Andy Cortez were to get these socks...
[54:26.990 --> 54:27.270]  Andy.
[54:27.270 --> 54:27.670]  Yeah.
[54:27.890 --> 54:29.250]  I feel like he would...
[54:29.250 --> 54:31.930]  I think he would be so excited, and then he would open it and see that they were cursed,
[54:32.030 --> 54:34.690]  and think the curse was real, and then be afraid of the socks.
[54:37.070 --> 54:38.150]  And then Rocco.
[54:38.270 --> 54:39.210]  Yeah, that's good.
[54:40.690 --> 54:41.070]  Oprah?
[54:44.030 --> 54:44.810]  Oh, dude!
[54:45.210 --> 54:45.590]  Coolio!
[54:45.950 --> 54:46.330]  Oh!
[54:47.250 --> 54:48.170]  That's a great one.
[54:49.010 --> 54:49.630]  Keenan and Kel.
[54:50.070 --> 54:50.710]  Keenan and Kel!
[54:50.890 --> 54:52.010]  Can we send it to Keenan and Kel?
[54:52.450 --> 54:54.270]  Keenan will throw them out, but Kel will use them.
[54:54.770 --> 54:55.110]  Yeah.
[54:55.490 --> 54:56.270]  They'd like that.
[54:57.270 --> 54:58.770]  Who else is big in f*** face lore?
[54:58.930 --> 54:59.790]  We could find Billy Ripken.
[54:59.910 --> 55:00.230]  I don't know if he'd get it.
[55:00.590 --> 55:02.290]  I mean, Don Zimmer, but we can't.
[55:02.430 --> 55:03.110]  What are we going to do?
[55:03.170 --> 55:04.310]  Put him on the...
[55:04.310 --> 55:05.790]  You can put him on the grave, I suppose.
[55:06.370 --> 55:07.970]  F***ing Andy just sent me this picture.
[55:09.710 --> 55:11.170]  Wario in a crystal ball.
[55:11.390 --> 55:12.110]  Proof of concept.
[55:14.830 --> 55:16.870]  Mario Party is not a proof of concept.
[55:19.250 --> 55:19.890]  Jackie Chan!
[55:20.790 --> 55:21.930]  That's a good one.
[55:22.350 --> 55:22.890]  I kind of...
[55:22.890 --> 55:24.870]  I don't want to offend Jackie Chan.
[55:24.970 --> 55:26.270]  No, nobody wants to offend Jackie Chan.
[55:26.270 --> 55:26.950]  Jackie Chan is a treasure.
[55:28.570 --> 55:29.610]  That's a good point, though.
[55:30.270 --> 55:31.870]  I like that line of thinking, though.
[55:31.970 --> 55:33.050]  Within our lore.
[55:33.310 --> 55:34.630]  People that are important to f*** face lore.
[55:34.650 --> 55:36.290]  Like the monkey from MVP 2?
[55:36.650 --> 55:39.170]  Is that someone who needs the sweet sauce?
[55:39.930 --> 55:40.710]  Yeah, is he alive?
[55:41.070 --> 55:42.270]  You think Jack is dead?
[55:42.470 --> 55:43.270]  How long does a...
[55:43.270 --> 55:44.050]  30, 40 years, man.
[55:44.050 --> 55:44.730]  What is it, a chimp?
[55:44.990 --> 55:45.850]  Chimp will live a long time.
[55:46.450 --> 55:49.390]  Unless they eat somebody's face off, then they've got to put them down.
[55:50.450 --> 55:50.810]  Siri.
[55:51.070 --> 55:52.310]  How long does a chimp live?
[55:53.130 --> 55:55.410]  The one in Dunstan checks in was an orangutan, I think.
[55:55.410 --> 55:59.110]  Dude, Dunstan checks in is a phenomenal movie.
[55:59.770 --> 56:00.450]  Should we watch that?
[56:00.830 --> 56:01.870]  When was the last time you saw it?
[56:02.350 --> 56:03.370]  Probably like a year ago.
[56:04.530 --> 56:05.530]  That's way too recent.
[56:05.850 --> 56:08.190]  It is a good-ass movie, though.
[56:08.310 --> 56:11.570]  Do you know that in that movie, Rupert Everett, the...
[56:11.570 --> 56:12.070]  The bad guy.
[56:12.170 --> 56:12.610]  The bad guy.
[56:13.490 --> 56:15.690]  I think growing up, I thought he was some old guy.
[56:15.850 --> 56:17.490]  He was in his 30s in that movie.
[56:17.610 --> 56:18.010]  What?
[56:18.350 --> 56:20.670]  Yeah, he was like 38 or something.
[56:21.730 --> 56:22.650]  He looked old.
[56:22.950 --> 56:23.210]  Wow.
[56:24.270 --> 56:25.890]  That might have been makeup.
[56:26.490 --> 56:27.430]  Yeah, maybe they aged him up.
[56:27.450 --> 56:29.210]  It says that chimps can live in captivity.
[56:29.410 --> 56:32.770]  Average lifespan, 39 years for a female, 32 for a male.
[56:32.950 --> 56:37.150]  However, world's oldest chimp, 68 years old.
[56:37.290 --> 56:37.630]  Oh, wow.
[56:38.270 --> 56:43.970]  I want to know if the orangutan from Dunstan checks in was older than the kid.
[56:45.230 --> 56:45.670]  Guaranteed.
[56:45.750 --> 56:47.670]  I feel like, yeah, almost certainly.
[56:47.730 --> 56:48.550]  It would have to be?
[56:48.750 --> 56:49.010]  Would it?
[56:49.430 --> 56:50.030]  I don't know.
[56:51.610 --> 56:52.350]  I don't know.
[56:52.570 --> 56:53.110]  Monkey ages?
[56:53.430 --> 56:57.310]  Yeah, or like, what are monkey age labor laws, too?
[56:57.450 --> 56:57.810]  It's true.
[56:57.970 --> 56:59.070]  It probably had to be a certain age.
[56:59.150 --> 56:59.390]  Yeah.
[56:59.670 --> 57:00.350]  To be on set.
[57:00.670 --> 57:00.830]  Yeah.
[57:01.710 --> 57:03.110]  Okay, so we got a good thing there.
[57:03.290 --> 57:04.010]  And then anything...
[57:04.010 --> 57:05.490]  Does it do we're filming soon?
[57:05.730 --> 57:06.250]  Oh, yeah.
[57:06.630 --> 57:09.130]  We could try to pick a date, but I think that's going to be in October.
[57:09.830 --> 57:12.310]  Like, I just don't even think we're going to have time in September.
[57:12.510 --> 57:13.570]  I just don't think it's going to happen.
[57:14.530 --> 57:18.930]  With Gavin's stuff, with the amount we're doing, and with the amount that's already happening,
[57:18.930 --> 57:20.410]  production-wise, in September.
[57:20.930 --> 57:23.450]  I think October is probably going to be the earliest we're going to be able to do it.
[57:23.570 --> 57:28.070]  But we have, like, a great list of stuff.
[57:28.270 --> 57:32.330]  But what if we were able to film it on the last week of September?
[57:32.690 --> 57:33.790]  I can check with...
[57:33.790 --> 57:34.570]  Wait, the Sox stream?
[57:34.750 --> 57:35.570]  No, no, no.
[57:35.730 --> 57:36.890]  We're back to does it do now.
[57:37.110 --> 57:37.170]  Does it do.
[57:37.450 --> 57:37.890]  Oh, okay.
[57:38.030 --> 57:39.370]  I can check with Shane.
[57:39.550 --> 57:41.070]  You're talking about the week of the 26th?
[57:41.090 --> 57:43.470]  Yeah, like maybe we did it on the 29th or 30th?
[57:43.530 --> 57:46.870]  I can check with Shane and see what the production calendar is.
[57:46.890 --> 57:47.250]  Just to see.
[57:47.330 --> 57:47.570]  Okay.
[57:47.570 --> 57:48.570]  You know, just to ask.
[57:49.250 --> 57:49.570]  I'll...
[57:49.570 --> 57:51.190]  I think I'm going to be...
[57:51.190 --> 57:52.410]  Well, I guess I...
[57:52.410 --> 57:53.170]  I shouldn't say.
[57:54.550 --> 57:57.370]  All right, I'll email our show floor.
[57:58.050 --> 58:02.070]  Does it do availability on...
[58:02.070 --> 58:03.110]  Did your laptop just turn off?
[58:03.510 --> 58:03.830]  Did it?
[58:04.290 --> 58:04.690]  Andrew, you there?
[58:05.490 --> 58:06.110]  It's frozen.
[58:06.330 --> 58:06.730]  Oh, is it?
[58:06.770 --> 58:07.010]  Hang on.
[58:07.170 --> 58:09.130]  I think it probably just was an hour timed out.
[58:09.350 --> 58:09.410]  Yeah.
[58:10.650 --> 58:11.850]  I don't think it was the battery.
[58:12.010 --> 58:12.390]  Is it the battery?
[58:14.350 --> 58:14.870]  Could have been.
[58:15.070 --> 58:15.850]  I think my battery's dead.
[58:15.890 --> 58:16.890]  You won't be able to see us anymore, Andrew.
[58:16.910 --> 58:17.190]  I'm sorry.
[58:17.190 --> 58:18.290]  No, that's okay.
[58:18.390 --> 58:18.810]  I have...
[58:18.810 --> 58:19.870]  I think there's a plug-in here somewhere.
[58:21.170 --> 58:23.250]  Does it do availability September...
[58:23.250 --> 58:24.130]  What were we saying?
[58:25.150 --> 58:25.550]  20...
[58:25.550 --> 58:26.530]  Looking at it like that.
[58:26.550 --> 58:27.090]  Last week?
[58:27.730 --> 58:28.530]  28th, 29th.
[58:28.710 --> 58:29.730]  Gavin, how would you feel about that?
[58:29.970 --> 58:31.030]  About like the last...
[58:31.030 --> 58:34.090]  The 29th or 30th of September.
[58:35.190 --> 58:35.770]  After therapy.
[58:35.950 --> 58:38.230]  I've got a camera coming in at some point then.
[58:39.390 --> 58:41.510]  What, you gotta be there to sign for a UPS receipt?
[58:41.770 --> 58:42.690]  No, I just got a rental.
[58:43.890 --> 58:44.710]  That'll be expensive to rent.
[58:44.710 --> 58:46.330]  Where do you rent a camera from?
[58:46.330 --> 58:48.950]  Do you have to get it from some other country or some other state?
[58:49.410 --> 58:50.670]  I rent it from the company that makes it.
[58:50.830 --> 58:52.370]  Oh, where are they from?
[58:52.650 --> 58:53.050]  New Jersey.
[58:53.290 --> 58:55.650]  So, New Jersey is the answer.
[58:55.810 --> 58:56.110]  Thank you.
[58:57.430 --> 58:58.430]  That's very logical.
[58:59.010 --> 59:00.590]  That you'd rent it from the company that makes it.
[59:01.210 --> 59:02.530]  Well, no, you could rent it from a rental company.
[59:02.530 --> 59:03.530]  I went in my head...
[59:03.530 --> 59:03.810]  Yeah.
[59:03.890 --> 59:05.490]  In my mind, I went to...
[59:05.490 --> 59:06.990]  There's like a Stanley Cup guy.
[59:07.070 --> 59:08.090]  Like, there's a camera guy.
[59:08.210 --> 59:11.050]  You had a camera guy that you were renting from that had all the cameras.
[59:11.370 --> 59:11.810]  All the lenses.
[59:13.010 --> 59:13.630]  Was it a Phantom?
[59:13.770 --> 59:14.150]  Makes sense.
[59:14.210 --> 59:14.370]  Yeah.
[59:15.510 --> 59:17.570]  Have you ever been to the Phantom headquarters in New Jersey?
[59:17.710 --> 59:18.150]  I have.
[59:18.550 --> 59:18.950]  How is it?
[59:18.970 --> 59:20.230]  They all came out and took pictures of me.
[59:20.390 --> 59:20.610]  Did they?
[59:21.250 --> 59:21.730]  That's nice.
[59:22.550 --> 59:23.350]  Was it a big crew?
[59:23.930 --> 59:24.830]  It was quite a lot of people, yeah.
[59:24.950 --> 59:25.030]  I bet.
[59:26.610 --> 59:27.050]  Okay.
[59:27.410 --> 59:28.230]  I'm getting it...
[59:28.230 --> 59:30.770]  I'm seeing what the availability is for that.
[59:31.230 --> 59:31.550]  Yeah, yeah.
[59:33.030 --> 59:36.050]  On either the 29th or 30th for a...
[59:36.050 --> 59:37.210]  Does it do...
[59:37.210 --> 59:37.450]  Shoot.
[59:38.090 --> 59:42.970]  I love that our list of influencers is just Andy from Kind of Funny, Rocco from Mega64,
[59:43.550 --> 59:44.270]  Ray Narvaez...
[59:44.270 --> 59:45.210]  Who used to work here.
[59:45.590 --> 59:47.390]  Coolio, Keenan Kell, and Jackie Chan.
[59:47.450 --> 59:48.250]  With a question mark.
[59:48.310 --> 59:48.990]  Has Ray ever...
[59:49.730 --> 59:50.810]  Does Ray know about this podcast?
[59:51.110 --> 59:52.290]  No, probably not.
[59:52.310 --> 59:52.890]  He's probably out of it.
[59:53.210 --> 59:54.090]  Have I talked to him?
[59:54.110 --> 59:55.430]  I must have talked to him about it.
[59:55.970 --> 59:56.930]  I must have, but I don't know.
[59:57.050 --> 01:00:01.870]  I think that wraps us up for our actual office talk chit and chat.
[01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:04.170]  Everybody talks to Ray except the people that used to work with Ray.
[01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:05.050]  What is that?
[01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.970]  Well, have you tried...
[01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:08.230]  I don't know if you know this.
[01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:09.890]  Ray, not the guy reaching out.
[01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:11.670]  Have you tried reaching out to Ray?
[01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:14.610]  I texted him recently.
[01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:17.750]  He's always streaming. I never want to bother him while he's streaming.
[01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:19.850]  Bother him while he's streaming. It doesn't matter.
[01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:21.050]  It does not matter.
[01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:28.250]  I just texted him, hey, remember when we used to record games using the capture window in Final Cut 7?
[01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:31.410]  And if it dropped one frame, the entire video would go.
[01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:33.770]  That's insane.
[01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:38.010]  And we were just reminiscing about how shitty our systems were.
[01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:38.670]  That's fucked.
[01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:43.330]  Oh, we also want to get more people in the audience, right, for Does It Do?
[01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:44.150]  Are you guys cool with that?
[01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:45.670]  Oh, yeah. So the audience really...
[01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:51.630]  One of the comments we noticed a lot on the launch was that people loved your laughter in it.
[01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:54.230]  And we had a... this is some sausage talk.
[01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:57.050]  We had a lot of conversations beforehand.
[01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:58.630]  Is that a phrase that I should know, by the way?
[01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:02.410]  It comes from the phrase, like, learn how the sausage is made.
[01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.810]  Oh, okay.
[01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:04.670]  It's like the peer behind the scenes kind of thing.
[01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:06.810]  I just decided to call it sausage talk in the middle of it.
[01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:09.570]  That's a very different podcast.
[01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:12.630]  Yeah. So a little sausage talk.
[01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:18.650]  We had early edits had canned laughter throughout the episode.
[01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:21.450]  And I got what it was going for.
[01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:25.150]  It was definitely, like, more toward the infomercial spoof angle.
[01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:27.110]  But it just sounded kind of hollow.
[01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:31.550]  And we noticed that even... we could hear your laughter in it still.
[01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:32.910]  And that was so much funnier.
[01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:35.350]  We dumped the canned laughter, boosted your laughter.
[01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:36.590]  So the discussion was...
[01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:38.630]  That was my first note, I think, actually, on the first cut.
[01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:42.650]  And I do think Uniform Board Meeting Sausage Talk.
[01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:49.690]  I do think that in the second episode, which is out by the time this is out,
[01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:52.930]  there were more people in the studio at that time.
[01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:55.690]  And so you'll probably hear more laughter and more kind of, like, chatter.
[01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:59.550]  And I think that's probably the way we should go with the second one.
[01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:02.410]  We'll just grab people from around and see if they want to come watch you guys.
[01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:05.810]  Watch Gavin fall and break his wrist or his ass or whatever.
[01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:09.970]  Maybe when I break my ass, we could replay it and put the GTA Wasted over it.
[01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:16.830]  People were like... I was in the live chat this morning when it premiered on YouTube.
[01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:19.470]  And people were like, oh, here's the part where Gavin gets hurt.
[01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:20.830]  Oh, there's where Gavin got hurt.
[01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:22.630]  And I was just like, that is not where Gavin got hurt.
[01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:24.890]  Gavin actually gets hurt in episode two.
[01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:27.110]  And people were like, holy fuck.
[01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:28.870]  Because that looked bad.
[01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:29.190]  Yeah.
[01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.510]  They were blown away when you kicked the TV.
[01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:32.350]  Okay, cool.
[01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:35.010]  So, I feel good about our list of things.
[01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:37.890]  Yeah, last thing we have here is Supplemental Content Office Talk.
[01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:39.850]  That's what this is. We recorded it.
[01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:42.990]  It is Uniform Board Meeting Sausage Talk 9-2-22.
[01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:50.030]  I also want to still work on a little, like, five-minute best-of clips for F*** Face.
[01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:55.070]  And call it, like, the F*** Face introduction document or something that people can send their friends.
[01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:55.430]  Oh.
[01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:56.970]  I don't know what to include.
[01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.650]  You're saying, like...
[01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:58.430]  Welcome to F*** Face.
[01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:01.250]  Like, when people say, like, how do I get into the show?
[01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:03.650]  It's like some best-of clips.
[01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.970]  Yeah.
[01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:05.330]  Like a little onboarding document.
[01:03:05.330 --> 01:03:07.970]  We're talking about making an entire episode of that, right?
[01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:09.090]  Like, trying to design the best opening.
[01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:10.390]  It could be a full, long thing, yeah.
[01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:12.870]  I just don't know what I'd put in it. There's so much to pick from.
[01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:13.270]  Yeah.
[01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:15.770]  But I feel like we do need a condensed...
[01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:19.250]  Like, people at the company are always asking me, like, which episode of F*** Face should I start with?
[01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:21.610]  And I have no idea ever what to send.
[01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:22.610]  Me neither. I'd just say 16.
[01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:23.050]  Yeah.
[01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:25.510]  For whatever reason, that is just the one that...
[01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:30.230]  I couldn't tell you what happens in episode 16, but I just remember it being a thing when we did episode 16.
[01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:32.370]  I sometimes just throw a number out.
[01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:32.530]  Yeah.
[01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:34.130]  I'll be like, oh, 46 is the one.
[01:03:34.550 --> 01:03:35.130]  That's dangerous.
[01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:36.330]  No, it sucked.
[01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:37.650]  Yep.
[01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:39.110]  Okay, so are we good, then?
[01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:41.310]  We got all of our...
[01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:42.210]  Are we, like...
[01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:45.810]  I think we covered all the things we needed to cover.
[01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:47.510]  I feel like we planned quite a bit.
[01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:51.470]  I hope people listen to this and don't just go, what the f*** is going on?
[01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:53.450]  Well, we'll have to release it for them to listen to it.
[01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:53.550]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:55.090]  I don't know, will it be discussed when we'll do that?
[01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:57.590]  No, we should... I guess we can figure.
[01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:57.950]  Do that offline?
[01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:59.630]  This could also be included in the...
[01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:00.290]  Is that too much sausage?
[01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:04.550]  No, we can figure out when you want it to come out. It's just like, when do you want it to come out?
[01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:06.830]  It's not coming out tomorrow.
[01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:09.210]  Right.
[01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:13.350]  This is the part where we have a f***ing conversation about it instead of just tomorrow.
[01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:16.050]  What do you think, like in a month?
[01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:17.290]  I think we could get it.
[01:04:17.290 --> 01:04:20.950]  Maybe episode 1 comes out as we record episode 2.
[01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:26.130]  I feel like we need to make more of the fact that this is... it just hit me.
[01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:30.610]  This is the first time we've ever had a meeting as a group related to f***face ever.
[01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:31.250]  Yes.
[01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:32.170]  And Nick is not here.
[01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.950]  This has never happened.
[01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:36.010]  I'd like to point out, so that people don't feel like we're exclusitory.
[01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:38.630]  Nick was invited.
[01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:39.730]  Yeah, he's...
[01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:40.110]  He just couldn't make it.
[01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:42.050]  He had something else going on.
[01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:42.890]  Something else going on.
[01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:44.150]  And he'll be at the next one, hopefully.
[01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:45.490]  Don't worry, he'll be here.
[01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:46.090]  Thank you, Stacey.
[01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:47.290]  Yeah.
[01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:48.670]  Yeah.
[01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:52.730]  Nick will be here for the next one, I'm sure.
[01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:56.670]  Is he going to go to the next Does It Do as well?
[01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:58.050]  Oh, he should.
[01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:59.350]  Because he's a great background laugher.
[01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:01.870]  I feel like he should be at all stuff.
[01:05:02.090 --> 01:05:03.270]  Oh, I definitely agree.
[01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:06.210]  I wish we could hear him during the episodes.
[01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:06.730]  Yeah.
[01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:10.670]  We can start doing that, I guess.
[01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:12.090]  Let's try.
[01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:15.170]  So if we look at this...
[01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:16.390]  Do you really want this to come out in a month?
[01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:17.330]  Do you want this to be in October?
[01:05:17.570 --> 01:05:19.990]  Do you want this to come out when we're going to do the next one?
[01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:21.430]  Were you thinking sooner or later?
[01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:22.090]  Sooner.
[01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:22.310]  Okay.
[01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:23.990]  I was thinking like the week of...
[01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:27.070]  Maybe like the week of the 12th?
[01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:27.850]  Oh, that's what I was thinking.
[01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:28.630]  Or like the 19th?
[01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:29.190]  Yeah, no.
[01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:30.110]  You just didn't say it?
[01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:31.290]  You just decided to keep it to yourself?
[01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:31.630]  Yeah.
[01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:31.990]  Cool.
[01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:32.630]  Right on.
[01:05:33.590 --> 01:05:33.850]  Great.
[01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:34.950]  Okay.
[01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:36.070]  Is everybody else okay with that?
[01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:36.790]  Week of the 12th?
[01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:37.790]  Yeah.
[01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.910]  Sounds great.
[01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:40.330]  We'll cover any sensitive dates.
[01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:40.510]  Why are you looking at me?
[01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:42.110]  Because you don't say anything!
[01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:43.410]  Because everybody else said something.
[01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:44.970]  Because we all said something!
[01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:46.190]  12th of October?
[01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:48.010]  What are you talking about?
[01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:51.030]  He's not listening at all!
[01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:54.070]  The week of September 12th, okay?
[01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:55.610]  And this is for when it's coming out?
[01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:58.790]  Just when this conversation comes out.
[01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:59.850]  So I just put it to you, Eric.
[01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:00.550]  Why are you looking at me?
[01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:01.170]  Why does it matter?
[01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:04.230]  Because I want to make sure we have buy-in from everyone.
[01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:05.590]  Because it's a group effort.
[01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:06.070]  Yeah, sure.
[01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:06.550]  No.
[01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:07.050]  No.
[01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:11.890]  Because if I don't get a yes from you, and then I hear about it later, and you go,
[01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:12.610]  well, I never said.
[01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:13.850]  Because that's why.
[01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:14.870]  I'm buying myself.
[01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:16.090]  It's what Gus taught me.
[01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:18.150]  Don't give any of these people an inch.
[01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:19.090]  Any of them.
[01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:19.970]  Is that really what he taught you?
[01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.290]  Yes.
[01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:21.570]  He said, don't give them an inch.
[01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:22.270]  Why?
[01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:22.970]  Why?
[01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:24.030]  Why would you give them an inch?
[01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:25.330]  And I went, well, I mean, sometimes.
[01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:28.330]  And he went, you're not helping yourself.
[01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:29.370]  And I went, genius.
[01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:31.090]  Genius.
[01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:33.770]  I didn't know Gus cared enough to have opinions.
[01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:34.250]  That's cool.
[01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:37.930]  It's why he just went like, just get the definitive.
[01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:39.150]  Karate chop it down.
[01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.430]  That's it.
[01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:40.110]  That's it.
[01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:41.350]  Okay, so Gavin said yes.
[01:06:41.550 --> 01:06:41.870]  Okay.
[01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:42.930]  That's all I wanted.
[01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:43.550]  He said, yeah, why not?
[01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:45.770]  He said, yes, sure.
[01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:46.110]  Yeah.
[01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:47.690]  It doesn't require my attendance.
[01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:48.170]  No.
[01:06:48.290 --> 01:06:49.290]  No, no, no.
[01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:51.010]  I just want to make sure that you're fine with it.
[01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:53.210]  We'll blur any date stuff.
[01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:53.650]  Yeah.
[01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:56.250]  Audio blur.
[01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:58.690]  Yeah, we'll do a Gaussian blur.
[01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:00.430]  You know what?
[01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:01.310]  Let's do a radial blur.
[01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:01.630]  A banana blur.
[01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:09.510]  We should work on getting this to be a live document for our next board meeting.
[01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:10.510]  We can all edit.
[01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:12.330]  Andrew can edit.
[01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:14.550]  I'll type it in and invite us all to this thing.
[01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:15.130]  I want a tablet.
[01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:16.390]  A what?
[01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:19.950]  He said tablet like it was three words.
[01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:22.130]  He's like, I want a tablet.
[01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:24.830]  I want a tablet the next time.
[01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:26.310]  Oh, no.
[01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:29.830]  I mean, I would type it up, my computer died, so.
[01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:32.670]  Okay, I think we're good then.
[01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:35.470]  It was a good first board meeting.
[01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:36.050]  Yeah.
[01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:37.670]  Next time we'll discuss earnings.
[01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:38.390]  That was very productive.
[01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:39.570]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:39.970]  Earnings.
[01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:40.350]  All right.
[01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:44.450]  All right, so we should stop this so that we can start the SBI post show.
[01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:45.930]  Oh, we should do that.
[01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.390]  Yeah.
[01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:47.030]  Okay.
[01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:48.430]  Well, everyone.
[01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:50.490]  Board meeting adjourned.
