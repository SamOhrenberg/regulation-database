[00:00.000 --> 00:02.280]  Why does the other one have the camera information on it?
[00:02.360 --> 00:07.020]  Uh, because I had to use my dumb budget phone and I guess it data marks or whatever.
[00:07.200 --> 00:08.440]  It imprints when you take a photo.
[00:09.940 --> 00:12.000]  That's a 50 megapixel picture.
[00:13.220 --> 00:14.620]  It's like dog shit.
[00:15.000 --> 00:15.780]  Oh, it's terrible.
[00:17.060 --> 00:18.460]  But I have a stool now.
[00:18.700 --> 00:19.560]  I have an office stool.
[00:20.020 --> 00:20.460]  So it's...
[00:20.460 --> 00:23.040]  That's the first time I've seen brown overexposed.
