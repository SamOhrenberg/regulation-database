[00:15.510 --> 00:22.990]  Hi, it is me, Andrew Raymond, whatever name you want to go with, part of the F*** Face
[00:22.990 --> 00:27.290]  Podcast. I am here doing a thing. I don't know if this will even be released. I don't
[00:27.290 --> 00:34.210]  know if we'll do another one of these. But recently I wanted to connect with the audience
[00:34.210 --> 00:38.570]  in a way that I haven't before. And I just posted the number I made for the child kicker
[00:38.570 --> 00:42.390]  shirt. And was like, hey, if you want to call, if you have a question, or you just want to
[00:42.390 --> 00:48.350]  talk, feel free. Phone this number. And I took calls for like, I don't know, maybe 70
[00:48.350 --> 00:52.630]  minutes or so. And it was wonderful. It was really awesome to connect with different people
[00:53.170 --> 00:57.050]  and answer the questions that I could. But I got a bunch of calls that I couldn't answer.
[00:57.510 --> 01:03.310]  And people left voicemails for those. And I feel weird randomly calling people back.
[01:03.310 --> 01:08.610]  That just seems rude to me. So I figured I could compile some of those questions and
[01:08.610 --> 01:14.050]  then answer them this way. So although I wasn't able to talk to you and answer them in a more
[01:14.050 --> 01:18.870]  personal sense, at least this exists and I can answer your question. Now, the first one
[01:18.870 --> 01:24.170]  is a very important one. What is proper child kicking technique? Now, I want it on the record.
[01:24.250 --> 01:28.930]  I feel it's very important to note that I have never kicked a kid. Despite what Geoff
[01:28.930 --> 01:34.270]  or Gavin may say, despite whatever allegations anyone may have about child kicking, never
[01:34.270 --> 01:39.670]  done it. I got close. I got very close. And I think my life would have radically changed
[01:39.670 --> 01:44.790]  if that did happen. So I'm glad that I didn't. But I can say I did think about it a lot in
[01:44.790 --> 01:50.250]  the moment. So although not experienced in any way, an unexperienced opinion of proper
[01:50.250 --> 01:55.450]  child kicking technique. And it's such a cliche, but I really thought of Leonidas and the
[01:55.450 --> 02:00.110]  chest kick. Because I don't feel like, I mean, he knocks a guy. If that hole didn't
[02:00.110 --> 02:05.730]  exist, I think that guy's going to be relatively okay. It's mainly a move to create distance.
[02:06.070 --> 02:12.350]  It's a separation move. And it's also in the differential of size between me and this child.
[02:12.450 --> 02:17.750]  It'd probably do a little bit more. I'd never want to inflict any real harm. But I thought
[02:17.750 --> 02:23.910]  maybe, I don't think I said this at the time, I had recently seen it follows. I've mentioned
[02:23.910 --> 02:29.450]  the possibility of a zombie attack, but it was really it follows paranoia where the demon in
[02:29.450 --> 02:35.190]  that movie will like follow you slowly and it can form into anything and it will kill you.
[02:35.330 --> 02:40.370]  So my head is like, this is an it follows situation. And that's where really in my mind,
[02:40.450 --> 02:45.550]  the suspense built to the point where I nearly kicked this child. But I didn't. That's an
[02:45.550 --> 02:50.770]  important part of that story. I'm going to move to the next question, which is what do I think
[02:50.770 --> 02:56.630]  of Hades, which is a video game that recently became available on Game Pass. It's been out
[02:56.630 --> 03:00.710]  for a long time. I love it. It's a lot of fun. I've never beaten a game like that. I believe
[03:00.710 --> 03:06.410]  it's actually, I don't know if it's a roguelike or a roguelite. There are differences between
[03:06.410 --> 03:10.410]  those two. I don't remember how you differentiate them. I've never beaten a game like that,
[03:10.530 --> 03:14.570]  but I really enjoyed it. And I'd recommend it, especially if you have Game Pass. It's no
[03:14.570 --> 03:19.390]  additional cost to you to give that thing a try. The third question, and this is actually
[03:19.390 --> 03:23.350]  really interesting question for me to think about, what's your favorite memory of you with
[03:23.350 --> 03:29.510]  Geoff or Gavin or anything RT related? So I was thinking about this, and the realization I had
[03:29.510 --> 03:35.810]  is I've never done anything privately with Geoff and Gavin. Like we've always, we've played games
[03:35.810 --> 03:40.410]  together, but it's always in a group of larger people. I've been at parties with both of them,
[03:40.970 --> 03:46.350]  gone out for meals, but it's never just been the three of us. The only stuff really,
[03:46.990 --> 03:51.870]  or it's mainly just the three of us. And that isn't even the case. Nick sometimes contributes
[03:51.870 --> 04:00.270]  in like a vocal sense. And Eric as well is face. That's the closest we've gotten to just the three
[04:00.270 --> 04:07.590]  of us. So I have to think of stories individually with both of them. For me with Gavin, when I think
[04:07.590 --> 04:13.830]  about Gavin, one of the many wonderful things that has come with making this podcast is it has
[04:14.850 --> 04:21.730]  deepened my friendship with Gavin, which has been really nice. Big fan of that guy. But in the past,
[04:21.790 --> 04:27.490]  we would play games and it would be occasional, it would be on and off. But one of my favorite
[04:27.490 --> 04:32.090]  gaming experiences ever is with Gavin. We were doing something in the first Destiny.
[04:32.710 --> 04:38.030]  You had to defeat this boss named Skolas. And every week the modifiers would change.
[04:38.450 --> 04:43.450]  And there was one week where it was so easy. I think for most weeks, you can melt them in like
[04:43.450 --> 04:49.290]  three seconds and it was not even an issue. It was you barely just moved on. The week Gavin and
[04:49.290 --> 04:54.910]  I did it was not one of those weeks. And it took like 80 minutes, I want to say. And it was so
[04:54.910 --> 05:00.730]  intense. We almost lost. We'd come back like it was just back and forth. One of my favorite gaming
[05:00.730 --> 05:06.050]  experiences ever. And it was one of the first memories I have where it's one of the earliest
[05:06.050 --> 05:10.690]  that I can think of, of just being like, I really like Gavin. I wish I spent more time with that
[05:10.690 --> 05:17.070]  person. And now through this show, I get the luxury of doing that, which is awesome. Geoff,
[05:17.570 --> 05:22.690]  this is a really tough one because I have a lot of, I have a lot of different stories with Geoff
[05:22.690 --> 05:28.410]  and experiences that have been just awesome and fun. I think something that immediately comes to
[05:28.410 --> 05:32.710]  mind is so there is that time I've talked about it before on the show where I didn't talk to Geoff
[05:32.710 --> 05:38.590]  for like a year and a half or two years because I'm an idiot. But then I came back and we became
[05:38.590 --> 05:45.450]  close again. We're talking regularly. And then we both watched, I think it was the 2017, 2018.
[05:45.850 --> 05:51.930]  It was so long ago, but it doesn't feel that long ago. A season for the Boston Celtics where we
[05:51.930 --> 05:57.490]  watched, if not every game, we maybe missed like three. And that's including their playoff run.
[05:57.550 --> 06:02.350]  They went deep that year. It was awesome. It was just so much fun to watch games with Geoff
[06:02.350 --> 06:09.870]  every couple nights and just embrace the culture of the team. I found a love for Tommy Heinzen,
[06:10.110 --> 06:15.750]  which is somebody that I didn't expect. You know, I wasn't that... I liked basketball,
[06:15.870 --> 06:19.830]  but I didn't follow it all that closely until that point. Tommy Heinzen became a personal
[06:19.830 --> 06:25.230]  hero of mine. And it was just really nice being able to connect with Geoff regularly every couple
[06:25.230 --> 06:30.570]  days, sit down and watch this game and just spend time with your friend. I think we all have those
[06:31.350 --> 06:36.670]  bonding activities. And that was just, I don't know, with the context beforehand of not talking
[06:36.670 --> 06:42.450]  for like a year and a half or two years. That was really nice. Next question. Yo, what's up,
[06:42.590 --> 06:48.970]  Raymond Ramone? I'm going to read it how it's written. Slash Andrew. How this going for you?
[06:49.530 --> 06:53.850]  I think this is going OK. I don't know, though. I don't know if anyone will listen to this or
[06:53.850 --> 07:00.290]  what I'll do with this, but I think it's all right. Next question. Not even a question.
[07:00.290 --> 07:05.390]  It was a recipe for honey dill sauce, which is apparently great with chicken tenders.
[07:06.450 --> 07:13.650]  Two third cup mayo. One third cup honey. One tablespoon of dill. Haven't tried it yet. I
[07:13.650 --> 07:20.290]  don't know if you want to. Feel free. Recipe for you. Next question. Somebody wanting to buy some
[07:20.290 --> 07:26.690]  of my BTS sauce. I am. I'm not selling right now, but there are moves being made. I'm in the process
[07:26.690 --> 07:33.310]  of taking my sauce to market. So we will see how that goes. Hopefully,
[07:34.930 --> 07:39.810]  that will not take a long time. And you won't be like, what happened? He said he was going to bring
[07:39.810 --> 07:43.630]  it to market and things fell through and it took me longer to put together what I want to do
[07:43.630 --> 07:51.030]  than expected. So hopefully, hopefully that will be soon. Who is Don Zimmer is the next question.
[07:51.910 --> 08:00.550]  Don Zimmer is if you took a baseball and planted it in the ground and then like juiced spinach and
[08:00.550 --> 08:08.970]  only poured spinach, spinach, spinach. Wow. I struggled on that one. If you only poured spinach
[08:08.970 --> 08:16.690]  juice, which sounds gross over that tree, let it grow, develop. It would sprout and bloom into
[08:17.270 --> 08:22.850]  Don Zimmer. I've never met. I didn't meet him, but I've never heard of. That's also not true.
[08:23.130 --> 08:27.990]  He loved baseball is what I'm trying to say. He was super into it. He had a titanium head,
[08:28.070 --> 08:34.550]  but not really. But you sure thought he did the way he rushed Pedro Martinez. That is the closest
[08:34.550 --> 08:40.210]  I think we'll ever get to a real life version of somebody thinking they're Rhino. Yeah. So that's
[08:40.210 --> 08:47.690]  Don Zimmer. Next question. Did I ever beat the 50 cent game in co-op? I have not. I did recently
[08:49.790 --> 08:55.030]  reset up my Xbox 360. So I'm very close. I just need to put an ethernet cable in and confirm that
[08:55.030 --> 09:00.650]  the co-op still works, which maybe I'll do tomorrow. We'll see. But no, I haven't yet.
[09:00.710 --> 09:05.290]  And I would like to. I had a friend of mine say they wanted to do it. And then I just haven't
[09:05.290 --> 09:10.430]  heard in a long time since then. So I may be on the lookout for a co-op partner if it works.
[09:11.210 --> 09:16.870]  Next question. Eat the pencil. Have you ever considered that I may have already?
[09:17.690 --> 09:23.410]  Next question. How are you doing, man? Day going well? Yeah, it's going fine. This is sort of the
[09:23.410 --> 09:31.370]  first thing I'm doing today. So, yeah, it's going good. Thrilling answer. I know. I kind of delivered
[09:31.370 --> 09:37.890]  that weirdly like I was going to continue. It doesn't matter. Yo, can I text this number? Yes,
[09:38.390 --> 09:44.130]  but I will never text back. But yes, you can text it. On to the next exciting question of
[09:44.790 --> 09:53.610]  what is Gamescom? Gamescom is a gaming streaming event, but it's also, I think, a physical event.
[09:54.050 --> 10:00.210]  I mainly know it as the event that Geoff Keighley uses to promote his upcoming streaming game show,
[10:00.710 --> 10:05.030]  whether it's, I guess, typically be the Game Awards, but might be Summer Games Fest. I don't
[10:05.030 --> 10:10.650]  really remember when it goes on, but I know it's the thing Geoff Keighley hosts. They show new games
[10:11.250 --> 10:17.190]  and they also give out weird awards. Like, I think Halo Infinite won the award for best
[10:17.190 --> 10:22.950]  Microsoft game or best Xbox game. Like, I have no idea who's voting on that or like what the
[10:22.950 --> 10:28.130]  criteria is. Are they things on the floor? It's just never clear. It's always the strangest
[10:28.130 --> 10:36.510]  categories and winners. It's very odd. Type of noodle is best. Oh boy. I don't know if I
[10:36.510 --> 10:45.410]  know noodles. What's a... is a ramen noodle... is a ramen noodle ramen? Is ramen the name of the
[10:45.410 --> 10:54.110]  noodle? Or is it the name of the dish? I'm gonna... I'm gonna say... I'm gonna say ramen noodle and
[10:54.110 --> 10:59.530]  just take whatever fury that brings. I don't know if that's even a noodle. I'm not a big
[10:59.530 --> 11:06.870]  noodle guy. Next question. If I was God, what would be my 10 plagues? This is a tough one because
[11:06.870 --> 11:12.190]  I don't want to end the world. I also don't... I don't know. This is... I'm gonna be boring.
[11:12.610 --> 11:16.210]  What would be like... initially I thought like, what if I made it rain ice cream?
[11:16.890 --> 11:21.770]  Because that just seems fun, but I feel like that would fuck up the planet. I'm assuming this is a
[11:21.770 --> 11:29.990]  planet-wide plague that I've inflicted as God. I'm gonna... could we do like five days rain,
[11:30.110 --> 11:35.970]  five days sun, as interesting as that is? Those would be my 10 plagues. It would be one a day
[11:35.970 --> 11:44.890]  for 10 days. Really boring. It would maybe only impact meteorologists. And they probably... I
[11:44.890 --> 11:48.530]  don't... I guess if I'm summoning it, they don't know what's going on. Doesn't matter.
[11:49.450 --> 11:57.350]  Next question is, how did I get into Rooster Teeth? Luck, largely. I told the story before,
[11:57.510 --> 12:05.070]  but I was really into Halo. Discovered Rooster Teeth when I was in grade six, maybe? Or five?
[12:06.450 --> 12:10.390]  Because I loved Halo 2, and I was looking for glitch videos, and I was on message boards for
[12:10.390 --> 12:13.990]  Halo, and I'd see red versus blue stuff on there all the time. So I eventually searched it,
[12:14.450 --> 12:20.290]  found it, loved it, showed it to people in my class. I was super into it, and then I just kind
[12:20.290 --> 12:26.890]  of fell off. And then I tried to play a game with somebody from Bungie, and I ended up accidentally
[12:26.890 --> 12:33.790]  connecting with Nico, who did the music for Red vs Blue. And that was sort of my just entrance
[12:33.790 --> 12:39.130]  to meeting a lot of the people involved with the company, like Geoff and Bernie at the time, and
[12:39.730 --> 12:45.950]  all those people. And I just had a lot of common interests, especially with when Achievement Hunter
[12:45.950 --> 12:50.830]  was starting, was focused on guides. Gaming is maybe my biggest hobby, something I care a lot
[12:50.830 --> 13:01.050]  about. And I think also another big factor for how I got into it was availability. I was homeschooled
[13:01.050 --> 13:05.910]  so I could easily set my schedule, and I was also pretty good at games at that time. So I was just,
[13:06.470 --> 13:11.290]  if Geoff needed me for a guide or whatever, I was always like, yeah, let's do it. Could be
[13:11.290 --> 13:16.270]  middle of the day, could be early in the morning, I was around. And I think that helped. They were
[13:16.270 --> 13:20.210]  making stuff that I thought was really cool, and it was awesome to be able to contribute in any way
[13:20.210 --> 13:26.170]  that I could. I think one of my weird credits is... oh god, I don't remember what the season is
[13:26.170 --> 13:34.010]  called. It's the first Red vs Blue season with Wash, I want to say. I have a credit in the credits
[13:34.010 --> 13:40.550]  as help because I helped unlock armor for the characters. There was a bunch of Red vs Blue
[13:40.550 --> 13:45.750]  stand-in accounts. I think that's it. I'm in one of the Red vs Blue DVDs at the bottom of the
[13:45.750 --> 13:50.130]  credits as a special thanks or something with the other people that did that. There was nine or ten
[13:50.130 --> 13:55.990]  of us. Next question is, did I ever get that pencil? Now, I'm assuming this is the big pencils
[13:55.990 --> 14:00.890]  that were made that looked like a bite was taken out of them. I haven't yet, but I know that Geoff
[14:00.890 --> 14:05.310]  or somebody's holding it for me. I will eventually get it. Thank you so much for making that. They're
[14:05.310 --> 14:11.270]  awesome. They look so cool. So, no, I haven't got it. I will get it. And thank you so much for
[14:11.270 --> 14:19.330]  making it. Next question, I need the photo of you and Gavin together. Now, this is referencing the
[14:19.330 --> 14:24.730]  most recent episode that came out when I recorded this. I told Gavin about a time we went to Pin
[14:24.730 --> 14:29.710]  Balls, which is an arcade together. He didn't remember. He said it never happened. So, I
[14:29.710 --> 14:35.610]  randomly messaged Caleb and was like, hey, can I call you? And he said, sure. So, I phoned him to
[14:35.610 --> 14:40.410]  ask if he remembered because it was the three of us. And then Jack showed up later with his wife.
[14:41.010 --> 14:46.330]  And he didn't remember. And Caleb didn't remember at first. But then Caleb found a photo that he
[14:46.330 --> 14:51.490]  took at that time. And he sent it to, I don't know, Gavin, I guess, or Geoff. I don't know who,
[14:51.750 --> 14:55.650]  how he sent it or how they saw it. But they saw it. And there have been people asking, like,
[14:55.650 --> 15:02.750]  where's the photo? That is a thing that I've been on the fence about. I have really bad
[15:02.750 --> 15:10.430]  issues with my body image. And it's something that I've struggled with for a long time. I just
[15:10.430 --> 15:18.210]  have had a lot of difficult experiences and traumatic experiences when I was growing up,
[15:18.810 --> 15:24.710]  whether it be bullying or just other issues in my personal life. So, it's been a thing that I've
[15:24.710 --> 15:31.570]  found hard to get past. I have good days with it. I think I already said that. Good days, bad days.
[15:32.230 --> 15:37.210]  I think a lot of people have these issues, but it's just something that is a trauma for me.
[15:37.630 --> 15:43.190]  I don't think I've ever told this story anywhere before. But when I was 12, maybe, or 13,
[15:43.970 --> 15:49.630]  I played games a lot. Like, I was super into video games, especially after my parents separated. That
[15:49.630 --> 15:55.390]  was sort of like, I disconnected from the outside world and I got really into games and I created
[15:55.390 --> 16:00.830]  friendships online. And I was really good friends, or at least I viewed it as a really good friendship
[16:00.830 --> 16:06.110]  with these two people. And we'd play games all the time. And then one day, I decided,
[16:06.290 --> 16:13.050]  I'm going to get an Xbox Live Vision Cam. So, I got it. I set it up. This was back 360 era,
[16:13.050 --> 16:20.470]  obviously. And I set it up and I invited them to a video call and they immediately just started
[16:20.470 --> 16:25.470]  making fun of how I looked, which at that age, especially, and the other stuff I had going on
[16:25.470 --> 16:35.050]  in my life, did not go well. It hurt a lot. And I started to cry. I don't mean to make this,
[16:35.290 --> 16:40.570]  I don't want to take this too, like, sad of a place. I'm good. But I started to cry and then
[16:40.570 --> 16:44.730]  they started making fun of that and they never talked to me again. I didn't really want to talk
[16:44.730 --> 16:51.530]  to them at that point, but it was just a really bad experience. So, I think on top of previous
[16:52.690 --> 16:59.330]  experiences, I also just have this thing of, like, sharing myself in that way and then getting
[16:59.330 --> 17:04.550]  rejected in a painful way. So, it's a thing I'm working on. That's why that photo isn't public.
[17:05.450 --> 17:09.790]  I hope to one day get to a point where I'm more comfortable with that stuff.
[17:10.570 --> 17:15.590]  I think that'd be nice. We'll see if I get there. I guess you'll know when that happens,
[17:15.650 --> 17:20.970]  if it does. I hope it does. And lastly, this is the last question. I don't know if this is too long.
[17:21.170 --> 17:25.370]  As I said, I don't know if this will even go out or what I'll do with this. It was just,
[17:25.490 --> 17:30.310]  I was trying to find ways to connect with all of you more because I really enjoy that. I think
[17:30.310 --> 17:37.770]  that's an awesome part and it means so much to us that you listen. It's nice to be able to,
[17:38.410 --> 17:43.570]  I don't know, I guess give back time in a way. It's something I enjoy doing at the very least
[17:43.570 --> 17:50.250]  in this way. But the last question is, are you able to do a bike trick as cool as Geoff
[17:50.250 --> 17:55.710]  or are my ankles too brittle? I've done one bike trick in my life. I was going to bring it up on
[17:55.710 --> 18:02.030]  the show when we talked about it, but I couldn't find a place for it. I was at a birthday party.
[18:03.190 --> 18:10.970]  I was at a birthday party and I was, it was this old shitty bike and I hadn't ridden a bike in
[18:10.970 --> 18:16.210]  years at that point. I was a kid. I was probably 10 ish, maybe a little bit older, not that much
[18:16.210 --> 18:23.190]  older though. And I was riding around this bike and they had this shitty small ramp that was
[18:23.190 --> 18:29.210]  just like a piece of wood leveraged against a larger piece of wood. And it was clearly like
[18:29.210 --> 18:34.510]  it was a setup ramp, but nobody had gone off of it. And, uh, I decided for whatever reason,
[18:34.990 --> 18:40.290]  fuck it, I'm going to do this. So I go down the street. I go as fast as I can. I hit this ramp.
[18:40.590 --> 18:46.050]  The whole bike like trembles as soon as I, I connect with the ramp. I fly through the air.
[18:46.110 --> 18:51.210]  I felt like it was like I took flight, but realistically I probably went nowhere,
[18:51.850 --> 18:59.710]  but landed it, landed it hard to the, in the sprocket shot off the bike. Like it just popped
[18:59.710 --> 19:04.190]  out. So I'm peddling and I'm going forward because of momentum, but the bikes is
[19:04.970 --> 19:10.170]  and I'm like, I don't know what's going on. I landed the trick. I almost crashed the bike
[19:10.170 --> 19:16.710]  because of that. I didn't though. So I am capable of doing a trick nowhere near as cool as Geoff's.
[19:16.710 --> 19:23.150]  And I also destroyed the bike. I'm like, Geoff, um, but the ankles are not the inhibitor
[19:23.870 --> 19:30.470]  of the bike trick. And with that, I think we're good. I've answered the questions that I had
[19:30.470 --> 19:36.410]  written down. Thank you so much to anyone who listens to this. If they do listen, I hope you
[19:36.410 --> 19:43.110]  enjoyed it. I hope this was somewhat interesting for you. Probably not, but I can hope. Uh,
[19:43.110 --> 19:48.090]  thank you so much for listening to our podcast. It means a lot to us. Uh, it's so much fun
[19:48.630 --> 19:52.870]  to make, and I'm so incredibly lucky that I get to do this thing with my friends
[19:52.870 --> 20:00.870]  and it wouldn't be possible without you. And that's really cool. No, thank you. Like genuinely,
[20:01.030 --> 20:07.170]  thank you so much. I don't know if I'll ever do one of these again. I would like to do more calls
[20:07.170 --> 20:12.050]  with people. I'll probably just like tweet out on my account. Hey, I'm going to be around for like 90
[20:12.050 --> 20:18.770]  minutes. Here's the number. Call me. So if you want to be aware of the next time that happens,
[20:18.970 --> 20:24.030]  feel free to follow me on Twitter. I guess my, I think my Twitter handle is still just Andrew Pan.
[20:24.610 --> 20:30.270]  Uh, so feel free. Follow me there. Uh, if you want to talk, hopefully I get to talk to you soon.
[20:30.790 --> 20:34.330]  Regardless, as I said before, I know I've said a lot, but thank you so much for listening.
[20:34.730 --> 20:39.990]  I hope you have a wonderful day or night or whatever's going on with you. I hope things
[20:39.990 --> 20:46.130]  are well. I will, uh, talk to you soon. Hopefully. Bye.
