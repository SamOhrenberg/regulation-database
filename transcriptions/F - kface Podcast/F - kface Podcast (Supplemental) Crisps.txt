[00:10.260 --> 00:14.940]  Hello and welcome to another supplemental piece of f***face content.
[00:15.100 --> 00:17.560]  You've been waiting for this one almost as long as we have.
[00:17.880 --> 00:20.560]  This is the International Chip Challenge.
[00:20.800 --> 00:23.440]  And not only are we going...
[00:23.440 --> 00:24.380]  What is wrong with you?
[00:24.960 --> 00:27.100]  We have never called it that.
[00:27.600 --> 00:28.840]  It's been months.
[00:29.400 --> 00:31.120]  And we've been calling it crisps.
[00:31.380 --> 00:34.760]  If it's a challenge too, it's the easiest challenge in the world.
[00:34.820 --> 00:37.280]  The challenge is who's got the best chips.
[00:37.280 --> 00:40.160]  Let me raise the stakes a little bit.
[00:40.280 --> 00:41.720]  So we're all going to submit scores.
[00:41.940 --> 00:43.580]  I'm just going to float this idea out there.
[00:43.920 --> 00:47.580]  Whoever has the lowest score can't return to their home country.
[00:48.020 --> 00:49.220]  Or they have to leave.
[00:49.640 --> 00:50.180]  What about that?
[00:50.500 --> 00:50.960]  For how long?
[00:51.040 --> 00:51.860]  Set some stakes.
[00:53.460 --> 00:54.180]  Forever. Permanently.
[00:54.380 --> 00:55.960]  You live in Canada.
[00:56.320 --> 00:58.380]  So one of you or I have to leave the country?
[00:58.540 --> 00:59.880]  Yeah, if we're at the bottom...
[00:59.880 --> 01:01.920]  Listen, I'm not going to be at the bottom of this.
[01:01.960 --> 01:03.620]  So I don't care setting the stakes or whatever.
[01:04.040 --> 01:05.720]  I'm pretty sure you're going to be at the bottom of this.
[01:05.720 --> 01:08.000]  No, I'm going to win this fucking competition.
[01:08.220 --> 01:09.860]  I got facts. I got passion.
[01:10.220 --> 01:10.720]  I got...
[01:10.720 --> 01:12.020]  It doesn't matter. None of that matters.
[01:12.060 --> 01:13.520]  Here's what we're doing.
[01:14.160 --> 01:16.620]  Apparently, it's not the International Chip Challenge.
[01:16.820 --> 01:18.280]  It's the Crisps of the World.
[01:18.940 --> 01:20.540]  Crisps of the World Unite.
[01:20.920 --> 01:21.480]  Question mark?
[01:22.080 --> 01:22.860]  That sounds like charity.
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.980]  Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to have everybody here eat the chips.
[01:27.080 --> 01:28.540]  But we're going to go in gag order.
[01:28.660 --> 01:30.040]  Only three of us can rate them.
[01:30.120 --> 01:33.780]  And that is because there are more Americans than Canadians and Brits here.
[01:33.780 --> 01:39.000]  And we don't want the scores to be colored by country bias, even unintentional country bias.
[01:39.140 --> 01:41.560]  So we're going to go Gavin, Andrew, Geoff.
[01:41.660 --> 01:43.980]  Thanks for bringing in another American buddy.
[01:44.680 --> 01:46.940]  Hold on. I'm not done yet. I'm trying to intro this.
[01:47.060 --> 01:51.000]  So we've got Gavin, Andrew, and Geoff, the three graders.
[01:51.360 --> 01:53.320]  Then, as always, we've got Eric and Gracie.
[01:53.460 --> 01:54.380]  They're going to eat as well.
[01:54.480 --> 01:55.980]  And Nick has never said no to food.
[01:56.140 --> 01:57.180]  So we got to have Nick in.
[01:57.180 --> 02:04.220]  And then for this episode and this episode only, because we all know f***face does not have guests.
[02:04.920 --> 02:14.420]  But I have filed a one-time regulation cast variance dispensation that has been approved by my producer, Eric Baudour.
[02:14.820 --> 02:15.960]  A special one-time.
[02:16.140 --> 02:22.640]  So because we saw Becca Frazier walk by in the hallway and we bullied her into the room, she's going to participate as well.
[02:22.800 --> 02:23.420]  She's going to eat.
[02:23.500 --> 02:24.600]  She's going to provide her opinions.
[02:24.600 --> 02:29.520]  Her scores don't count in the official ruling because she is an American and we can't have two Americans.
[02:29.580 --> 02:33.800]  I like the fact that the person who set the rule of no guests saw someone walking by the window.
[02:34.680 --> 02:35.780]  That's all it takes.
[02:35.920 --> 02:38.560]  What do you want me to do? I've known Becca for 38 years.
[02:38.840 --> 02:42.200]  I never see her. On the rare occasion I see her, I want to hang out with her for a minute.
[02:42.200 --> 02:43.320]  I was excited to see her.
[02:43.580 --> 02:51.920]  I think this is great, but I do think we need to change the rules of no guests unless you walk by the window and Geoff doesn't expect you.
[02:51.960 --> 02:52.280]  There you go.
[02:52.300 --> 02:53.540]  In which case, you will be on.
[02:53.540 --> 02:57.180]  So if you want to be on the show, just surprise Geoff while we're recording.
[02:57.340 --> 02:58.200]  Yeah, okay, that's fair.
[02:58.960 --> 03:06.640]  That's what the rule, no guests or you have to walk by at the right moment and I have to like you and it has to be a long enough time since I've seen you.
[03:07.000 --> 03:07.420]  There's a few layers.
[03:07.420 --> 03:08.660]  It's complicated, but it can be done.
[03:08.800 --> 03:11.820]  And Becca, is it true that you've deployed your husband to pick up the kids?
[03:11.940 --> 03:12.320]  I have.
[03:13.700 --> 03:16.080]  Very quick change of plans and now I'm here.
[03:16.200 --> 03:16.460]  Excellent.
[03:16.640 --> 03:18.360]  You know what I love about having older kids?
[03:18.360 --> 03:25.760]  I told Millie today, because I have her this week, I said, you'll have to figure out how to get home today because I'm stuck at work.
[03:25.840 --> 03:26.660]  She goes, okay.
[03:27.160 --> 03:28.640]  And then I know that she'll figure it out.
[03:28.720 --> 03:29.400]  She's almost 18.
[03:29.580 --> 03:30.020]  She's smart.
[03:30.240 --> 03:31.300]  Is that what you do with your kids or no?
[03:31.660 --> 03:31.980]  No.
[03:32.140 --> 03:32.380]  Okay.
[03:32.580 --> 03:34.960]  My kids will burn down the house if they manage to get in.
[03:35.400 --> 03:38.500]  I got a text from Millie yesterday because Geoff lost his wallet.
[03:39.280 --> 03:40.040]  Yeah, I did.
[03:40.520 --> 03:43.320]  I was scared it was at your house, but I didn't want to bug you, so Millie texted me.
[03:44.080 --> 03:46.020]  You didn't want to bug him?
[03:46.100 --> 03:46.940]  I like to text guys.
[03:46.960 --> 03:47.480]  No, I get it.
[03:47.480 --> 03:48.420]  Oh, what?
[03:48.780 --> 03:50.700]  I don't like to text anybody.
[03:50.980 --> 03:54.180]  Gavin's been texting me Smee videos and Smee pics.
[03:54.360 --> 03:56.140]  Well, that's the relationship you and Gavin have.
[03:56.560 --> 03:59.680]  I hung out with Gavin Friday, and I hung out with Gavin Saturday.
[03:59.800 --> 04:02.720]  So for them to bother Gavin with a text on Sunday, it feels like too much to me.
[04:02.860 --> 04:03.220]  Wow.
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.740]  I love him so much.
[04:05.880 --> 04:09.620]  He is literally next to my daughter and my fiance, my favorite person on this planet.
[04:09.700 --> 04:11.860]  I just feel like that would be the person that you would bug.
[04:11.940 --> 04:14.820]  Honestly, it's kind of neck and neck between the three.
[04:14.980 --> 04:16.060]  It depends on the day.
[04:16.060 --> 04:19.640]  But because of that, I just have so much respect for him in his personal time.
[04:19.720 --> 04:20.580]  I don't want to bother him.
[04:20.640 --> 04:22.040]  I like him too much to talk to him.
[04:22.280 --> 04:24.160]  Does Geoff text you every day or no?
[04:24.280 --> 04:25.380]  We talk about houses rarely.
[04:26.060 --> 04:26.100]  Sometimes.
[04:26.100 --> 04:26.520]  That's about it.
[04:26.860 --> 04:29.780]  Yeah, Beck and I have been texting recently about British toilets.
[04:30.080 --> 04:31.800]  Yeah, I have some opinions.
[04:34.420 --> 04:35.540]  That'll be the next challenge.
[04:35.880 --> 04:38.200]  Okay, we should get into these crisps.
[04:38.320 --> 04:38.520]  Okay.
[04:38.520 --> 04:45.840]  So, the way that Geoff was saying this is going to work is we're going to start with the four crisps from each person.
[04:46.440 --> 04:48.320]  And then you guys are going to send me your scores.
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.660]  You won't reveal them to everyone.
[04:52.860 --> 04:55.240]  And we'll tally them all up at the end.
[04:55.720 --> 04:58.480]  Is it 1 through 10 or 1 through 100?
[04:58.700 --> 04:59.040]  1 through 10.
[04:59.320 --> 05:00.220]  Let's do 1 through 10.
[05:00.680 --> 05:02.000]  No decimals.
[05:02.000 --> 05:03.140]  No decimals, goddammit.
[05:03.180 --> 05:03.680]  No decimals.
[05:03.760 --> 05:04.780]  Because then it might as well be 100.
[05:05.020 --> 05:06.520]  It might as well be 100, you're right.
[05:06.520 --> 05:07.420]  That's what I always say.
[05:07.480 --> 05:08.300]  Nobody listens to Geoff.
[05:10.940 --> 05:12.460]  All I was saying was 1 through 10.
[05:12.520 --> 05:13.580]  We'll do like 8.7.
[05:13.660 --> 05:15.240]  It's like, no, then just do 1 through 100.
[05:15.400 --> 05:16.240]  None of this makes sense.
[05:16.520 --> 05:17.320]  Anyway, 1 through 10.
[05:17.420 --> 05:18.120]  87.7.
[05:18.180 --> 05:18.340]  Okay.
[05:20.420 --> 05:21.700]  So, that is what we'll do.
[05:21.920 --> 05:24.060]  And we'll start with, it'll be gag order.
[05:24.240 --> 05:26.440]  So, it'll be Gavin, Andrew, Geoff.
[05:26.820 --> 05:31.140]  And you can talk about why you've selected these crisps, what the point was, and what you think.
[05:32.620 --> 05:34.420]  Forward gag order, not reverse gag.
[05:34.720 --> 05:34.880]  Yeah.
[05:34.880 --> 05:35.580]  Reverse gag would be Geoff.
[05:35.760 --> 05:37.000]  Otherwise it'd be gag, and that doesn't make any sense.
[05:37.040 --> 05:37.360]  Yeah, right.
[05:37.420 --> 05:38.680]  We wouldn't want to be backwards gag.
[05:38.760 --> 05:39.580]  Okay, yeah.
[05:40.140 --> 05:40.880]  Take your pick.
[05:42.140 --> 05:43.180]  What are we starting with?
[05:43.500 --> 05:44.340]  What's it gonna be?
[05:46.060 --> 05:46.840]  What are these?
[05:47.580 --> 05:48.140]  What do you mean?
[05:49.880 --> 05:51.260]  I've noticed an immediate problem.
[05:51.940 --> 05:52.880]  Well, these are nuts, Eric.
[05:53.080 --> 05:53.880]  Nice and...
[05:55.280 --> 05:56.360]  That's what it is.
[05:56.560 --> 05:56.640]  Nope.
[05:56.740 --> 05:57.060]  Knick-knacks.
[05:57.980 --> 05:58.620]  That's nuts.
[05:59.280 --> 05:59.580]  Knick-knacks.
[05:59.620 --> 06:00.100]  Those aren't chips.
[06:01.420 --> 06:02.220]  What did he ask for?
[06:02.260 --> 06:03.220]  Alright, we'll start with...
[06:03.220 --> 06:04.060]  I thought that...
[06:04.060 --> 06:05.440]  I ordered the fucking thing.
[06:05.960 --> 06:07.360]  Is that not what it's supposed to be?
[06:07.420 --> 06:07.940]  God, no.
[06:08.760 --> 06:09.400]  They're crisps.
[06:09.480 --> 06:10.140]  Those are nuts.
[06:11.160 --> 06:11.800]  Dude, I don't know.
[06:11.840 --> 06:12.300]  Don't look at me.
[06:12.540 --> 06:14.180]  I can't believe...
[06:14.180 --> 06:15.180]  I think I'm on your side.
[06:15.340 --> 06:16.060]  I think I'm at a disadvantage here.
[06:16.240 --> 06:17.100]  I think I'm on your side.
[06:17.500 --> 06:18.260]  Well, I sent you a...
[06:18.260 --> 06:19.160]  Wait, wait.
[06:19.500 --> 06:20.140]  Why don't we start...
[06:20.140 --> 06:20.420]  No, I got...
[06:20.420 --> 06:20.700]  Listen.
[06:21.520 --> 06:22.600]  I think I got the right product.
[06:22.720 --> 06:23.560]  Andrew, it's frazzles.
[06:24.140 --> 06:25.320]  Alright, we're starting with frazzles.
[06:25.680 --> 06:27.160]  Well, I just opened knick-knacks.
[06:27.720 --> 06:28.200]  Hold on.
[06:28.340 --> 06:29.240]  No, go back to frazzles.
[06:29.460 --> 06:31.040]  Because, you know, it's the first one of the day.
[06:31.100 --> 06:32.020]  Let's get breakfast-y.
[06:32.020 --> 06:34.000]  These are bacon-flavored frazzles.
[06:34.200 --> 06:34.440]  Okay.
[06:34.560 --> 06:35.880]  I think that's the only flavor they do.
[06:36.800 --> 06:37.440]  Try a frazzle.
[06:37.620 --> 06:38.940]  So why don't they just call them frazzles?
[06:40.040 --> 06:41.400]  Just in case you don't know what you're getting into.
[06:42.420 --> 06:42.860]  Oh, sorry, Nick.
[06:42.940 --> 06:45.320]  So, um, these are corn snacks.
[06:46.100 --> 06:46.940]  Oh my God.
[06:47.120 --> 06:48.620]  Stick your nose in and get a whiff.
[06:49.280 --> 06:50.700]  Here's the thing I'll say about British chips.
[06:50.720 --> 06:51.400]  Very bacon-y.
[06:51.960 --> 06:53.140]  High, high smell.
[06:53.460 --> 06:53.680]  Yeah.
[06:53.940 --> 06:55.240]  These smell like dog treats.
[06:55.440 --> 06:56.000]  A hundred percent.
[06:56.580 --> 06:59.020]  Alright, if you already started eating them, why don't you chill your bean?
[07:00.580 --> 07:01.580]  He has a point.
[07:01.580 --> 07:02.480]  You didn't chill your bean.
[07:02.900 --> 07:07.220]  Alright, now, everyone except for Eric, because he's already done it, why don't we eat our lovely frazzle crisp?
[07:07.380 --> 07:07.780]  You ready, Andrew?
[07:07.780 --> 07:08.240]  Now, hold on.
[07:08.320 --> 07:09.320]  Can Eric eat this again?
[07:09.540 --> 07:12.400]  No, I'll wait until everyone has their second frazzle crisp.
[07:13.200 --> 07:16.180]  I do appreciate that they kind of have, like, bacon lines on them.
[07:16.500 --> 07:16.760]  Oh, yeah.
[07:16.860 --> 07:17.500]  Oh, yeah, they do.
[07:17.760 --> 07:18.220]  A slight attempt.
[07:18.600 --> 07:20.880]  That's definitely drawn on in no way.
[07:21.080 --> 07:21.380]  Yeah.
[07:22.140 --> 07:22.720]  Alright, ready?
[07:23.080 --> 07:23.340]  Everyone?
[07:23.460 --> 07:23.780]  I think so.
[07:23.900 --> 07:24.360]  Here we go.
[07:24.400 --> 07:24.780]  Everyone but Eric.
[07:25.540 --> 07:26.940]  Well, shouldn't eat right into the microphone.
[07:27.140 --> 07:28.500]  Should not eat right into the microphone.
[07:28.580 --> 07:29.220]  No, it's ASMR.
[07:29.480 --> 07:30.580]  The crunch factor is important.
[07:30.580 --> 07:32.780]  I'm going to be scoring based on crunch.
[07:33.460 --> 07:34.720]  He's got an excellent point.
[07:35.560 --> 07:38.420]  I'm going to eat a second frazzle.
[07:39.280 --> 07:41.920]  Get a few going, it really gets the... it builds.
[07:44.360 --> 07:45.340]  I'm already slacking.
[07:46.080 --> 07:46.280]  Okay.
[07:47.140 --> 07:50.100]  Now, I should say frazzle in my slack, right?
[07:50.100 --> 07:53.260]  Yeah, I mean, I'm keeping track as we go, so it's up to you.
[07:54.180 --> 07:54.560]  Eric.
[07:55.580 --> 07:56.100]  Frazzle.
[07:57.100 --> 07:59.220]  And then I'll text the number.
[07:59.220 --> 08:00.940]  I won't say it out loud, people will know it.
[08:01.360 --> 08:02.180]  I want it to be a secret.
[08:02.560 --> 08:03.460]  Do I score my own?
[08:03.800 --> 08:04.200]  Definitely.
[08:04.440 --> 08:05.200]  You gotta score your own.
[08:05.900 --> 08:06.300]  Dumbass.
[08:06.440 --> 08:07.860]  Why would you not?
[08:09.380 --> 08:10.260]  And no decimals.
[08:10.880 --> 08:11.140]  No.
[08:11.480 --> 08:11.700]  Okay.
[08:13.500 --> 08:13.780]  Okay.
[08:14.300 --> 08:14.500]  Alright.
[08:15.000 --> 08:16.880]  These are...
[08:16.880 --> 08:21.440]  It kind of keeps, like, if you stop eating it, it's weird.
[08:22.080 --> 08:23.460]  But if you keep eating it...
[08:23.460 --> 08:23.600]  Yeah.
[08:23.980 --> 08:24.760]  No, I agree.
[08:25.280 --> 08:28.300]  I think if you stop eating it, it seems to swell in your mouth a little.
[08:28.300 --> 08:30.120]  Yeah, there's a little bloating going on.
[08:30.440 --> 08:32.620]  But I don't mind the texture at all.
[08:33.160 --> 08:33.600]  Oh, excellent.
[08:33.840 --> 08:38.100]  I like the texture, I like the crunch, but I will say the more I eat, the less I like it.
[08:38.220 --> 08:38.500]  Interesting.
[08:38.840 --> 08:39.420]  There's a drop-off.
[08:39.500 --> 08:44.780]  I will say on the back, for the nutritional values, it says typical nutritional values.
[08:46.580 --> 08:46.940]  Interesting.
[08:47.580 --> 08:52.120]  It does feel really bacon-y, which is, like, you don't get that a lot in snacks.
[08:52.300 --> 08:56.320]  Like, what they're supposed to taste like and what they taste like don't often line up.
[08:56.320 --> 09:00.120]  Yeah, and I feel like humans don't get a lot of bacon-flavored snacks.
[09:00.720 --> 09:01.700]  It's usually dogs.
[09:03.440 --> 09:04.740]  These are, like, treats for us.
[09:04.940 --> 09:11.380]  I have received scores from Geoff and Gavin, and Andrew simply sent me the word brazzle.
[09:11.800 --> 09:17.180]  I forgot! I got caught up in the bacon thing, in the bacon flavor, and I forgot to put a number in.
[09:17.180 --> 09:19.360]  I filled it in. I followed it up.
[09:19.940 --> 09:22.060]  Should we go to the opinions of Nick and Gracie, too?
[09:22.280 --> 09:23.660]  Please. Gracie, any thoughts?
[09:23.660 --> 09:26.220]  Love the texture, but they do taste like microwaved bacon.
[09:26.780 --> 09:27.580]  Very specifically.
[09:28.080 --> 09:29.820]  The more you eat, the better they are.
[09:30.240 --> 09:31.280]  So I'm just gonna keep going.
[09:31.300 --> 09:31.760]  I feel the opposite.
[09:31.840 --> 09:35.180]  The opposite of what Andrew said, so if you combine both those opinions, normal.
[09:37.380 --> 09:42.400]  Okay, I have scores from everyone for brazzles.
[09:42.980 --> 09:44.580]  Let's move on to your next crisp.
[09:44.740 --> 09:45.440]  Second crisp.
[09:45.840 --> 09:47.240]  Oh, I go all of mine in a row?
[09:47.920 --> 09:48.220]  Yeah.
[09:48.240 --> 09:51.180]  I mean, we've been discussing it in that way for, like, an hour now.
[09:51.180 --> 09:54.500]  Yeah, it was pretty painfully clear that's how we were doing it.
[09:54.920 --> 09:58.340]  I disagreed with doing it that way, but everybody else seemed on board.
[09:58.580 --> 09:59.400]  Yeah, that's the opposite of what I said.
[10:00.540 --> 10:01.440]  Twiglets, everyone!
[10:01.540 --> 10:03.520]  To me, it would have made sense to go... yeah.
[10:04.820 --> 10:05.920]  We could go RemRobin.
[10:06.640 --> 10:07.260]  Well, it's too late now.
[10:07.920 --> 10:10.720]  High in fiber, and you spell fiber like a British person.
[10:10.880 --> 10:11.240]  Fibre.
[10:11.520 --> 10:11.860]  Fibre.
[10:12.340 --> 10:13.960]  Oven-baked, not fried.
[10:14.980 --> 10:16.340]  Becky, you were just ending one.
[10:16.420 --> 10:17.020]  I was, yes.
[10:17.100 --> 10:18.140]  Did you have frazzles?
[10:18.140 --> 10:18.880]  I know.
[10:19.160 --> 10:24.160]  The only Twiglets that I had were a prawn cocktail-flavored chip, and then there was
[10:24.160 --> 10:25.840]  some other spicy chip that I got.
[10:25.980 --> 10:27.680]  We had our own little tasting.
[10:28.580 --> 10:30.660]  I gotta be honest, this just looks like a British pretzel.
[10:31.880 --> 10:36.480]  Yeah, I will say the back of the bag, it says, gives you that distinctive knobbly shape.
[10:36.560 --> 10:38.420]  I don't think I've ever wanted a knobbly shape.
[10:38.580 --> 10:40.080]  These are very unattractive.
[10:40.160 --> 10:41.980]  Oh, and it just has nutrition information.
[10:42.140 --> 10:43.720]  You don't like knobbly-looking Twigs?
[10:43.720 --> 10:46.900]  I mean, I think they warned us what we were in for with the name.
[10:46.900 --> 10:48.660]  These look awful.
[10:48.740 --> 10:49.600]  Knuckles, yeah.
[10:49.940 --> 10:50.800]  These fucking suck.
[10:54.900 --> 10:58.220]  We didn't do all the pomp and circumstance of eating one at the same time.
[10:58.360 --> 11:01.960]  I just got yelled at the first time for it, and then it never, it didn't happen the second time.
[11:01.980 --> 11:03.460]  Oh, these are so bad.
[11:03.980 --> 11:04.700]  Becky just went in.
[11:04.840 --> 11:07.620]  These suck so much. Oh my god.
[11:08.260 --> 11:09.340]  What have you done to us, Gavin?
[11:09.980 --> 11:10.620]  These taste like they're burned.
[11:10.620 --> 11:12.960]  Why are you making us eat a bag of sticks?
[11:13.200 --> 11:14.140]  What are you doing?
[11:14.140 --> 11:16.960]  This tastes like eating the street.
[11:17.200 --> 11:18.780]  Yeah, I was going to say dirty air.
[11:18.940 --> 11:24.420]  This tastes like Christmas. In England, a nice communal bowl on some coffee table somewhere.
[11:24.620 --> 11:26.040]  Oh, Christmas Day.
[11:26.420 --> 11:29.360]  If this tasted like Christmas, it wouldn't have made it in America.
[11:29.800 --> 11:33.280]  Are these intended to be flavored, or is this just their native core?
[11:33.840 --> 11:35.140]  Alright, I got you. You got my...
[11:35.820 --> 11:37.140]  Oh, I definitely got it.
[11:37.420 --> 11:38.940]  Is this what potpourri tastes like?
[11:40.160 --> 11:41.580]  I love these. These are great.
[11:41.920 --> 11:42.960]  Are you serious?
[11:42.960 --> 11:50.240]  Is this like a thing where you've had them your whole life, and you're a little sentimental about them, and you tasted them before you had better things?
[11:50.740 --> 11:52.560]  Is Jacob a beloved figure in England?
[11:54.820 --> 11:55.860]  Since 1851.
[11:56.860 --> 12:03.240]  The taste, the initial taste is, like Gracie said, like dirty air. It's like the street.
[12:04.160 --> 12:08.020]  The aftertaste is, I don't know another way to describe it, but nature.
[12:08.620 --> 12:08.920]  Yeah.
[12:08.920 --> 12:15.240]  It tastes like being in the woods, but specifically face down in the dirt in the woods.
[12:15.360 --> 12:22.520]  It tastes a little bit like if you ate a stick from the woods that somebody dropped a cigarette near.
[12:23.020 --> 12:23.380]  Yeah.
[12:24.460 --> 12:27.400]  Like it's not the cigarette, but it's of the cigarette.
[12:28.320 --> 12:31.720]  Gracie, these smell like 80% wheat flour.
[12:31.820 --> 12:34.460]  Remember those little weird wood chips that were on your elementary school playground?
[12:34.560 --> 12:34.860]  Yeah.
[12:36.360 --> 12:38.020]  You're eating a campsite.
[12:38.020 --> 12:39.240]  Yeah, it is very campy.
[12:39.620 --> 12:44.180]  To me, they're kind of like a packet of cigarettes found in a canal that dried off.
[12:44.560 --> 12:45.380]  Okay, yeah.
[12:45.580 --> 12:47.820]  I can see why you'd love that. And that says Christmas to you.
[12:48.120 --> 12:52.780]  I will say that is kind of how they look, so you have to send me your score.
[12:53.140 --> 13:00.220]  His family used to do that time-honored British tradition where they would bury the presents in the canal and the kids would have to go drink them out on Christmas morning.
[13:01.400 --> 13:07.140]  Okay, well that's Twiglets. Let's go to our next crisp.
[13:07.140 --> 13:09.040]  Oh, Andrew hated them, right.
[13:09.540 --> 13:10.900]  Oh, they're terrible, yeah.
[13:12.360 --> 13:14.760]  The next one is Pickled Onion Monster Munch.
[13:14.920 --> 13:15.120]  Okay.
[13:15.660 --> 13:16.480]  Now, I believe...
[13:16.480 --> 13:21.520]  I'm so sick of you making me eat pickled shit. Sorry, but I had to vocalize.
[13:21.600 --> 13:25.920]  I believe they temporarily made these smaller, and then everyone complained and they made them big again.
[13:26.060 --> 13:29.980]  And I remember as a kid struggling to get my mouth wide enough to fit some of these in.
[13:31.680 --> 13:37.060]  So, pickled... it's Walker's, which is just Lay's logo, but says Walker's.
[13:37.660 --> 13:39.760]  But pickled onion is a flavor.
[13:40.300 --> 13:41.020]  I'm into this.
[13:41.120 --> 13:42.120]  Oh, the smell.
[13:42.740 --> 13:43.840]  Alright, everyone at the same time?
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.480]  This is another baked...
[13:46.940 --> 13:48.140]  Do not smell!
[13:49.760 --> 13:55.760]  If you put your nose into the bag and just huff it, if you just huff it, you can't keep going.
[13:55.960 --> 13:56.800]  I'm liking it.
[13:57.060 --> 13:58.460]  Do a real deep breath in.
[13:58.460 --> 13:59.960]  It just got in my nose.
[14:01.440 --> 14:03.300]  Are we all eating at the same time?
[14:03.880 --> 14:04.540]  Yeah, you ready, Andrew?
[14:04.740 --> 14:04.960]  Okay.
[14:05.440 --> 14:05.960]  I'm ready.
[14:06.040 --> 14:06.620]  These are big.
[14:06.960 --> 14:08.220]  Here we go.
[14:08.420 --> 14:09.360]  Three, two, one.
[14:11.420 --> 14:11.820]  Oh!
[14:13.080 --> 14:13.880]  Jesus Christ!
[14:13.920 --> 14:14.220]  Hell yeah.
[14:15.400 --> 14:16.060]  These are the bomb.
[14:17.660 --> 14:18.900]  Oh, give me a fucking frazzle.
[14:19.640 --> 14:22.220]  I feel bad for everyone listening to this with these scrunchies.
[14:23.040 --> 14:24.260]  What the fuck is this called? Monster Munch?
[14:24.440 --> 14:24.660]  Yeah.
[14:25.560 --> 14:26.400]  Oh, so good.
[14:26.820 --> 14:27.440]  These are good.
[14:28.060 --> 14:30.740]  These are like amped up bunions.
[14:31.080 --> 14:31.520]  Okay.
[14:33.000 --> 14:33.200]  Okay.
[14:33.200 --> 14:33.580]  Okay.
[14:34.260 --> 14:34.860]  That's interesting.
[14:34.960 --> 14:36.340]  And they have other flavors than Monster Munch.
[14:37.400 --> 14:38.040]  Not just pickled onion.
[14:39.200 --> 14:40.340]  There's a spicy one.
[14:40.500 --> 14:41.000]  There's a...
[14:41.000 --> 14:42.100]  I think a roast beef one.
[14:42.780 --> 14:42.960]  Oh!
[14:43.520 --> 14:43.760]  What the fuck?
[14:44.340 --> 14:44.800]  Roast beef.
[14:47.600 --> 14:48.580]  Nick loves that one.
[14:49.120 --> 14:50.220]  Nick's excited about the roast beef.
[14:50.560 --> 14:51.540]  Nick, what were your thoughts on that?
[14:51.920 --> 14:52.280]  Oh, yeah.
[14:52.380 --> 14:52.980]  Nice and pickley.
[14:54.800 --> 14:55.920]  I told you!
[14:57.400 --> 14:59.860]  When it comes to food...
[14:59.860 --> 15:03.180]  Nick is a freak when it comes to food.
[15:03.740 --> 15:04.660]  Oh, nice and pickley.
[15:04.940 --> 15:05.320]  What?
[15:05.800 --> 15:06.980]  Dude, Nick likes all food.
[15:07.200 --> 15:07.720]  He's a weirdo.
[15:07.780 --> 15:09.700]  The only thing I've ever seen of meat they didn't like was Sir Strauman.
[15:10.360 --> 15:10.860]  That's true.
[15:11.580 --> 15:12.160]  Sir Strauman?
[15:12.780 --> 15:14.540]  That pickled in lye.
[15:14.620 --> 15:19.120]  It's like they package fish in lye and then put it in a tin.
[15:19.280 --> 15:21.000]  It's supposed to be the smelliest thing on earth.
[15:21.060 --> 15:22.280]  It is the smelliest thing on earth.
[15:22.740 --> 15:23.360]  Herring goo.
[15:23.580 --> 15:23.760]  Yeah.
[15:24.400 --> 15:25.560]  So you all say...
[15:25.560 --> 15:27.240]  You look like you hated those, Eric.
[15:28.340 --> 15:29.700]  I didn't like that at all.
[15:30.080 --> 15:31.560]  It really...
[15:32.320 --> 15:36.760]  It was the worst part of a pickle flavor with the...
[15:36.760 --> 15:41.080]  I didn't know there was a worst part of a Funyun flavor, but it has it.
[15:41.360 --> 15:43.660]  Now, see, I want to keep my opinions close to the vest.
[15:43.780 --> 15:46.360]  I don't want to give up how I feel about it until at the end.
[15:46.380 --> 15:46.660]  Why?
[15:47.120 --> 15:47.920]  Well, I don't know.
[15:48.080 --> 15:50.400]  Because then you get an idea of how everybody's doing.
[15:50.440 --> 15:51.560]  You're certainly not going to remember.
[15:51.800 --> 15:52.320]  I liked them.
[15:53.180 --> 15:53.540]  Ooh.
[15:53.820 --> 15:55.540]  I gave it a high score.
[15:55.540 --> 15:56.680]  You're not going to...
[15:56.680 --> 15:57.520]  You didn't have to say that.
[15:57.900 --> 15:58.260]  I...
[15:58.860 --> 15:59.800]  I gave it an eight.
[16:01.520 --> 16:02.960]  You gave that an eight?
[16:03.880 --> 16:05.240]  Sounds like Andrew didn't go for the eight.
[16:05.240 --> 16:05.960]  Why would you...
[16:05.960 --> 16:07.020]  You don't have to give a score.
[16:07.020 --> 16:07.760]  You just told me I could.
[16:07.800 --> 16:08.320]  You can just say what it is.
[16:08.420 --> 16:08.660]  Okay.
[16:08.980 --> 16:10.000]  I'm not giving a score.
[16:10.100 --> 16:10.700]  And lastly...
[16:10.700 --> 16:12.080]  I'm just trying to follow your lead, Eric.
[16:12.180 --> 16:14.680]  Yeah, and Eric didn't get me any knick-knacks, so...
[16:14.680 --> 16:15.380]  Are we going to eat nuts?
[16:15.560 --> 16:15.760]  Yeah.
[16:15.920 --> 16:16.940]  I don't know what this was.
[16:17.240 --> 16:18.740]  I love how much Nick loves this recording.
[16:18.740 --> 16:21.320]  Watch it be so much better than whatever it was you were going to pick.
[16:21.820 --> 16:22.860]  Nick, this is the...
[16:22.860 --> 16:25.020]  Watching you enjoy this has been the best part for me.
[16:25.020 --> 16:26.220]  These are from Thailand.
[16:26.540 --> 16:27.420]  I don't know!
[16:28.200 --> 16:28.940]  Wait, is that Thai?
[16:29.080 --> 16:29.580]  What is that?
[16:30.760 --> 16:30.960]  What?
[16:31.200 --> 16:31.820]  Show me the link.
[16:32.000 --> 16:33.060]  You don't have Thai people in England?
[16:33.260 --> 16:34.160]  I ordered the thing that I had.
[16:34.260 --> 16:34.880]  I don't know what to tell you.
[16:34.900 --> 16:36.160]  You've never even seen these before?
[16:36.460 --> 16:36.700]  No.
[16:36.800 --> 16:37.420]  Like, wow.
[16:37.840 --> 16:38.960]  Double Crunch Peanuts.
[16:39.120 --> 16:39.620]  Let's try it.
[16:40.720 --> 16:41.440]  I ordered...
[16:41.440 --> 16:42.000]  Here's the thing.
[16:42.120 --> 16:42.800]  I had the link.
[16:42.900 --> 16:43.460]  I ordered...
[16:43.460 --> 16:44.420]  I ordered knick-knacks.
[16:44.840 --> 16:45.620]  Oh, that's knick-knacks.
[16:45.700 --> 16:46.040]  Yeah, look.
[16:46.100 --> 16:47.100]  I ordered these.
[16:47.200 --> 16:47.720]  Get a refund.
[16:47.740 --> 16:48.220]  Doesn't look like it.
[16:48.220 --> 16:48.940]  They sent me...
[16:48.940 --> 16:50.400]  They sent me knick-knocks.
[16:52.640 --> 16:54.020]  Alright, I'm just going to have to...
[16:54.020 --> 16:55.640]  I'm going to have to rip it and just pass the bag around.
[16:55.740 --> 16:56.400]  Oh my god.
[16:57.360 --> 16:58.280]  What is knick-knocks?
[16:58.840 --> 16:59.660]  What is knick-knacks?
[16:59.680 --> 17:01.040]  Double Crunch Peanuts.
[17:01.600 --> 17:02.160]  From Thailand.
[17:02.980 --> 17:04.120]  Here, I'm sending you this, Eric.
[17:04.140 --> 17:05.680]  Is this what your guy's thing looks like?
[17:05.780 --> 17:06.900]  Or did I get the proper thing?
[17:06.960 --> 17:07.520]  Let me...
[17:07.520 --> 17:09.260]  Oh, this will be an interesting variable here.
[17:10.120 --> 17:10.780]  That is...
[17:10.780 --> 17:11.820]  That's got to be the right thing.
[17:12.340 --> 17:12.980]  It's Cheetos.
[17:13.280 --> 17:14.040]  Yeah, that's a knick-knack.
[17:14.480 --> 17:15.200]  That's just Cheetos.
[17:15.340 --> 17:16.260]  Imagine we're eating those.
[17:16.360 --> 17:16.920]  It's just Cheetos.
[17:17.580 --> 17:19.300]  So I'm eating a different thing than you.
[17:19.300 --> 17:19.640]  Yes.
[17:19.840 --> 17:22.240]  I ordered knick-knacks and they sent us knick-knocks.
[17:22.700 --> 17:23.400]  You didn't verify?
[17:23.400 --> 17:24.760]  You didn't check it to the picture?
[17:24.760 --> 17:26.060]  I don't know what the fuck these things are!
[17:26.260 --> 17:27.840]  You got Monster Munch.
[17:27.900 --> 17:29.520]  It's got this thing I don't even want to look at.
[17:29.740 --> 17:31.980]  Been in my office for so fucking long.
[17:32.120 --> 17:33.800]  And I just look at it every day and I go,
[17:33.880 --> 17:34.540]  I hate this.
[17:34.720 --> 17:35.640]  I hate this so much.
[17:35.920 --> 17:36.400]  Nick was like,
[17:36.420 --> 17:37.380]  are you excited to do crisps?
[17:37.400 --> 17:39.080]  And I'm like, I'm excited to be done with crisps.
[17:39.260 --> 17:40.620]  Dude, it's a shame those aren't yours
[17:40.620 --> 17:41.320]  because they're a banger.
[17:41.660 --> 17:42.920]  Are these my highest scoring thing?
[17:42.920 --> 17:43.060]  These are really good.
[17:43.140 --> 17:43.520]  I'll take it.
[17:43.660 --> 17:44.480]  Alright, let's go in.
[17:46.780 --> 17:47.140]  Incredible.
[17:47.400 --> 17:47.700]  Wow!
[17:48.040 --> 17:48.560]  Yeah, these are good.
[17:48.840 --> 17:50.140]  Are they real peanuts?
[17:50.480 --> 17:52.080]  Is this an imitation peanut product?
[17:54.020 --> 17:54.640]  Nick's got it.
[17:54.680 --> 17:55.240]  Because I'm allergic.
[17:58.320 --> 17:58.980]  God damn it.
[17:59.240 --> 18:00.680]  We should have this conversation in the hall then.
[18:01.340 --> 18:01.660]  Alright.
[18:02.260 --> 18:03.620]  Alright, Geoff sent me his score.
[18:04.400 --> 18:05.060]  Those are pretty good.
[18:05.600 --> 18:06.640]  I feel like I've had something similar.
[18:06.760 --> 18:07.460]  Andrew, what do you think?
[18:07.480 --> 18:08.060]  Yeah, they're called peanuts.
[18:09.140 --> 18:11.540]  I don't know if mine tastes the same.
[18:11.620 --> 18:13.160]  I would say that the knickknacks I had
[18:13.160 --> 18:14.460]  taste like a Christmas tree.
[18:14.920 --> 18:16.280]  If I had to compare a taste to it.
[18:16.280 --> 18:17.480]  They'd probably go well with the Twiglets then.
[18:18.520 --> 18:18.880]  Well,
[18:19.400 --> 18:21.760]  it should be illegal for such a fun name
[18:21.760 --> 18:22.720]  to taste so shit.
[18:22.720 --> 18:24.980]  I love the name.
[18:25.120 --> 18:26.700]  It seems like a great time.
[18:26.800 --> 18:27.760]  And it's just trees.
[18:28.420 --> 18:28.900]  Sorry.
[18:29.360 --> 18:30.000]  That's an aside.
[18:30.680 --> 18:32.180]  Send me your score.
[18:32.600 --> 18:34.120]  These peanuts are really good.
[18:34.720 --> 18:35.640]  Congratulations on the knickknack.
[18:35.640 --> 18:37.640]  This is a great bar snack right here.
[18:37.900 --> 18:39.140]  Andrew, let me ask you a question.
[18:39.240 --> 18:39.600]  Be honest.
[18:40.100 --> 18:42.480]  Did you like a single bite of mine?
[18:44.460 --> 18:44.940]  Yes.
[18:45.340 --> 18:45.760]  Yes, I did.
[18:45.900 --> 18:46.080]  Okay.
[18:46.420 --> 18:46.800]  There you go.
[18:47.140 --> 18:48.260]  I'm looking at his scores.
[18:49.020 --> 18:50.240]  I can verify that.
[18:50.880 --> 18:51.120]  Okay.
[18:51.120 --> 18:51.820]  Gavin,
[18:52.600 --> 18:54.480]  I'm concerned that not one of these
[18:54.480 --> 18:56.280]  was a potato product.
[18:58.700 --> 19:01.740]  The way he looked down.
[19:03.000 --> 19:04.180]  But would you say that crispy?
[19:04.660 --> 19:05.020]  You know what?
[19:05.080 --> 19:06.080]  It's interesting you say that, Becca.
[19:06.760 --> 19:08.280]  Because I was faced with
[19:08.280 --> 19:09.940]  all of the most amazing
[19:09.940 --> 19:11.260]  chip products in America.
[19:11.720 --> 19:12.440]  And I asked like,
[19:12.520 --> 19:13.260]  is a Cheeto,
[19:13.440 --> 19:14.280]  does a Cheeto count?
[19:14.800 --> 19:15.580]  And they're like, absolutely.
[19:15.580 --> 19:15.980]  Very split.
[19:16.240 --> 19:17.160]  Cheese puffs, Cheetos.
[19:17.220 --> 19:18.100]  You can do whatever you want.
[19:18.160 --> 19:18.840]  You can have a Frito.
[19:18.940 --> 19:19.360]  That counts.
[19:19.360 --> 19:20.260]  And I thought,
[19:20.780 --> 19:22.200]  no, I'm going to be a purist.
[19:22.340 --> 19:24.040]  I'm going to go with only potato chips.
[19:24.120 --> 19:24.760]  Not Doritos.
[19:25.400 --> 19:25.760]  Nothing else.
[19:25.860 --> 19:27.200]  Just potato ass chips.
[19:27.620 --> 19:28.340]  Because I wanted to be true
[19:28.340 --> 19:29.180]  to the spirit of this thing.
[19:29.300 --> 19:31.340]  I guess the corner shops of my youth
[19:31.340 --> 19:33.060]  were littered with non-potato products.
[19:33.220 --> 19:34.000]  They are in America too.
[19:34.220 --> 19:34.360]  Yeah.
[19:35.460 --> 19:35.820]  Okay.
[19:35.980 --> 19:37.620]  So we have all of our scores for Gavin.
[19:37.860 --> 19:38.720]  We're going to wait.
[19:39.380 --> 19:40.620]  Now we go to Andrew.
[19:41.360 --> 19:41.720]  Andrew,
[19:42.100 --> 19:43.860]  which crisp will you be starting with?
[19:44.240 --> 19:45.220]  I think I'm going to,
[19:45.280 --> 19:46.280]  we're going to open with
[19:46.280 --> 19:48.220]  the old Dutch barbecue chip.
[19:48.220 --> 19:49.900]  Oh, okay.
[19:49.900 --> 19:50.360]  What the fuck?
[19:50.600 --> 19:52.960]  Now, for some additional information,
[19:53.160 --> 19:54.660]  I emailed all of these companies
[19:54.660 --> 19:56.640]  asking if they would like me
[19:56.640 --> 19:57.800]  to bring up any specific points
[19:57.800 --> 19:59.220]  during this very official ruling.
[19:59.820 --> 20:01.680]  And I got a nonsensical reply
[20:01.680 --> 20:02.220]  by old Dutch.
[20:02.300 --> 20:04.000]  So we will ignore their feedback.
[20:04.400 --> 20:06.220]  And they gave you a bullshit response?
[20:06.800 --> 20:07.260]  They did.
[20:07.380 --> 20:08.500]  Yeah, they gave me a bullshit response.
[20:08.600 --> 20:09.060]  But old Dutch,
[20:09.180 --> 20:10.900]  this is a Canadian staple.
[20:11.340 --> 20:12.440]  This is your classic,
[20:12.520 --> 20:14.340]  like at a baseball game chip.
[20:14.420 --> 20:16.460]  Like this is a vending machine chip.
[20:16.460 --> 20:18.800]  It delivers on exactly what you want
[20:18.800 --> 20:19.500]  from that experience.
[20:20.140 --> 20:20.200]  Okay.
[20:20.300 --> 20:20.800]  And these are,
[20:21.320 --> 20:22.240]  just so everyone at home knows,
[20:22.480 --> 20:25.360]  these are old Dutch barbecues.
[20:25.380 --> 20:26.540]  No, Santa Fe barbecues.
[20:27.080 --> 20:27.280]  Ooh.
[20:27.720 --> 20:29.120]  I didn't know they were famous
[20:29.120 --> 20:29.860]  for their barbecues.
[20:29.880 --> 20:31.000]  Do you think this is Santa Fe?
[20:31.260 --> 20:31.900]  Oh, what does it say?
[20:31.980 --> 20:32.760]  I can't even move it around.
[20:32.780 --> 20:33.400]  It's French.
[20:33.680 --> 20:34.140]  Savoir de.
[20:34.300 --> 20:34.500]  Okay.
[20:34.660 --> 20:35.460]  From where I was,
[20:35.480 --> 20:36.360]  it looked like Santa Fe, right?
[20:36.480 --> 20:37.000]  You saw it too.
[20:37.420 --> 20:38.700]  It means flavor.
[20:39.200 --> 20:40.280]  It's flavor in French.
[20:40.480 --> 20:40.680]  Okay.
[20:40.760 --> 20:42.400]  So this is barbecue flavored chips.
[20:42.480 --> 20:43.340]  Did you eat the chip without?
[20:44.820 --> 20:45.000]  No.
[20:45.000 --> 20:45.300]  Okay.
[20:45.300 --> 20:45.480]  Did you?
[20:45.720 --> 20:46.020]  Mm-mm.
[20:46.380 --> 20:47.460]  I'm making sure you didn't.
[20:47.500 --> 20:48.040]  That's all.
[20:48.300 --> 20:48.900]  I'm just asking.
[20:49.500 --> 20:49.860]  I'm asking.
[20:50.100 --> 20:50.520]  All right, Andrew,
[20:50.580 --> 20:51.160]  you want to count us down?
[20:51.720 --> 20:52.120]  Three,
[20:52.540 --> 20:52.940]  two,
[20:53.280 --> 20:53.620]  one.
[20:54.940 --> 20:56.180]  I was ready to bake three chips in
[20:56.180 --> 20:56.580]  by that time.
[20:57.720 --> 20:58.300]  Good chip.
[20:58.840 --> 20:59.720]  That's a good chip.
[20:59.780 --> 21:02.540]  That is a great value-based chip.
[21:02.640 --> 21:02.720]  What?
[21:02.720 --> 21:05.000]  This is a very subtle barbecue.
[21:05.760 --> 21:06.600]  Yeah, some would say
[21:06.600 --> 21:08.060]  not flavored as barbecue at all.
[21:08.280 --> 21:08.840]  What is this?
[21:08.840 --> 21:09.120]  What is this?
[21:09.200 --> 21:09.860]  Is that just old Dutch?
[21:10.840 --> 21:11.860]  That is such a plain...
[21:11.860 --> 21:11.980]  Spice!
[21:12.420 --> 21:12.820]  What?
[21:13.460 --> 21:14.820]  A little bit of spice to it.
[21:15.240 --> 21:15.680]  A little bit.
[21:15.820 --> 21:16.340]  A little bit.
[21:16.520 --> 21:17.900]  That is the most plain chip
[21:17.900 --> 21:18.660]  you could bring to
[21:18.660 --> 21:19.580]  International Crisps.
[21:19.600 --> 21:20.780]  If you didn't tell me
[21:20.780 --> 21:21.840]  this was barbecue flavored,
[21:22.040 --> 21:22.980]  I would never,
[21:23.840 --> 21:24.240]  ever,
[21:25.120 --> 21:25.520]  ever
[21:25.520 --> 21:26.700]  guess barbecue flavored.
[21:26.800 --> 21:27.480]  I would maybe accept
[21:27.480 --> 21:28.420]  paprika flavored.
[21:29.180 --> 21:30.820]  If you think this chip is spicy,
[21:30.940 --> 21:32.100]  you think whole milk is spicy.
[21:32.880 --> 21:33.620]  No, I'm saying
[21:33.620 --> 21:34.540]  there's a little spice there.
[21:34.560 --> 21:35.420]  I'm not saying it's spicy.
[21:36.040 --> 21:37.940]  There is a spice on it
[21:37.940 --> 21:38.780]  as in seasoning
[21:38.780 --> 21:39.980]  and spices and herbs.
[21:40.160 --> 21:41.560]  Right, as in when I pick it up
[21:41.560 --> 21:42.680]  and then I have something
[21:42.680 --> 21:43.700]  on my fingers afterwards.
[21:44.140 --> 21:45.320]  I sent you my review.
[21:46.380 --> 21:47.560]  Um, Andrew,
[21:47.680 --> 21:48.720]  what did Old Dutch say?
[21:49.240 --> 21:50.640]  They said something about
[21:50.640 --> 21:51.740]  like we make quality chips
[21:51.740 --> 21:52.160]  or something,
[21:52.280 --> 21:53.060]  but it didn't make sense
[21:53.060 --> 21:54.280]  and it was very disappointing.
[21:54.500 --> 21:54.800]  They do.
[21:55.000 --> 21:55.900]  Hey, fuck you.
[21:56.060 --> 21:58.660]  I don't want to hear it.
[21:59.400 --> 22:00.000]  This is like
[22:00.520 --> 22:01.280]  served with your
[22:01.280 --> 22:02.740]  sandwich at lunch chip.
[22:03.120 --> 22:04.280]  Yeah, absolutely.
[22:04.680 --> 22:05.100]  It's a passive chip.
[22:05.120 --> 22:06.140]  It's a Canadian...
[22:06.140 --> 22:06.360]  It's a very passive chip.
[22:06.360 --> 22:07.800]  This is like when you get
[22:07.800 --> 22:08.600]  this bag of chips
[22:08.600 --> 22:09.100]  with your sandwich,
[22:09.100 --> 22:10.080]  you go, I should've got the pickle.
[22:10.620 --> 22:10.880]  Yeah.
[22:11.080 --> 22:11.840]  I should've got the pickle spear.
[22:12.100 --> 22:13.220]  No one has ever said
[22:13.220 --> 22:14.220]  I should've got the pickle.
[22:14.500 --> 22:15.180]  That doesn't happen.
[22:15.260 --> 22:15.780]  You just heard me say it.
[22:15.800 --> 22:16.380]  I've said that.
[22:16.580 --> 22:16.920]  Thank you, Nick.
[22:17.440 --> 22:18.400]  What do you think of those, Nick?
[22:19.080 --> 22:20.420]  It's like eating
[22:20.420 --> 22:21.500]  if it was barbecue
[22:21.500 --> 22:22.720]  before the grill was lit.
[22:23.460 --> 22:23.860]  Mmm.
[22:24.260 --> 22:25.360]  I would say it's like
[22:25.360 --> 22:26.260]  eating the memory
[22:26.260 --> 22:27.520]  of a barbecue potato chip.
[22:27.820 --> 22:28.380]  You know what?
[22:28.480 --> 22:28.620]  Yeah.
[22:28.740 --> 22:30.100]  It's been a few years
[22:30.100 --> 22:30.720]  since the factory.
[22:31.180 --> 22:31.860]  You know, when you
[22:31.860 --> 22:33.220]  stop eating them,
[22:34.120 --> 22:34.980]  there's a little bit
[22:34.980 --> 22:35.820]  more of a flavor.
[22:36.540 --> 22:36.940]  Aftermath.
[22:36.960 --> 22:38.100]  There is an after...
[22:38.100 --> 22:39.340]  Some would say aftertaste.
[22:39.720 --> 22:40.640]  I like aftermath.
[22:40.880 --> 22:41.740]  That's way better.
[22:41.960 --> 22:43.020]  Andrew, you gotta send me your score.
[22:43.600 --> 22:44.500]  The flavor or aftermath?
[22:44.700 --> 22:44.920]  Oh, yeah.
[22:46.240 --> 22:46.840]  An aftermath.
[22:47.440 --> 22:47.920]  I told you,
[22:47.960 --> 22:48.420]  when it's food,
[22:48.480 --> 22:49.260]  he's a fucking freak.
[22:49.360 --> 22:49.760]  I know, man.
[22:49.900 --> 22:51.120]  It's just so weird.
[22:53.460 --> 22:54.340]  What a...
[22:54.340 --> 22:55.620]  This is the millennium
[22:55.620 --> 22:56.140]  of aftermath.
[22:56.820 --> 22:57.860]  So, all right.
[22:58.600 --> 22:59.900]  That is old Dutch barbecue.
[23:00.340 --> 23:01.440]  Gavin is going back
[23:01.440 --> 23:02.320]  to his Twiglets.
[23:02.940 --> 23:03.540]  That was a frazzle.
[23:03.660 --> 23:03.960]  Get it right.
[23:04.180 --> 23:04.460]  Okay.
[23:05.000 --> 23:05.760]  All right.
[23:05.880 --> 23:07.160]  Andrew, which is next?
[23:07.160 --> 23:07.520]  Okay.
[23:07.820 --> 23:08.860]  We are now...
[23:08.860 --> 23:09.400]  We're going to move into
[23:09.400 --> 23:10.600]  the Hawkins Cheezies.
[23:10.740 --> 23:11.600]  Now, this is also
[23:11.600 --> 23:12.780]  a Canadian staple.
[23:12.940 --> 23:13.740]  You've talked about these before.
[23:14.100 --> 23:14.560]  I have.
[23:14.720 --> 23:15.820]  This is what I love about Hawkins.
[23:15.880 --> 23:16.900]  I did some research for this.
[23:17.220 --> 23:18.380]  They had one factory
[23:18.380 --> 23:19.760]  that they made in 1953,
[23:20.360 --> 23:20.960]  burnt down,
[23:21.260 --> 23:22.500]  they made another factory,
[23:22.680 --> 23:23.320]  and that's just where
[23:23.320 --> 23:24.440]  they've existed this whole time.
[23:24.700 --> 23:25.520]  They do not pay
[23:25.520 --> 23:26.420]  for advertising
[23:26.420 --> 23:27.500]  because that means
[23:27.500 --> 23:28.140]  they would have to
[23:28.140 --> 23:29.160]  produce more Cheezies
[23:29.160 --> 23:30.140]  and they don't want that.
[23:30.300 --> 23:31.100]  That's also why
[23:31.100 --> 23:32.140]  it's not available in America.
[23:32.160 --> 23:32.840]  These are dense.
[23:32.980 --> 23:34.640]  This is a really heavy bag.
[23:34.840 --> 23:35.760]  You could kill someone
[23:35.760 --> 23:36.360]  with this bag.
[23:36.360 --> 23:37.080]  These are...
[23:37.080 --> 23:38.080]  It's a thick Cheeto.
[23:38.840 --> 23:39.620]  It's really heavy.
[23:39.720 --> 23:40.880]  It's a heavy Cheeto, yeah.
[23:41.280 --> 23:42.640]  It's a high-quality Cheezy.
[23:42.680 --> 23:43.400]  Also not potato.
[23:43.680 --> 23:44.360]  Wait, so you're saying...
[23:45.980 --> 23:47.420]  I give it three or four, okay?
[23:47.500 --> 23:48.500]  I'm not going to take this potato.
[23:49.360 --> 23:50.020]  I don't know.
[23:50.180 --> 23:51.220]  Should I just go for a standout?
[23:51.240 --> 23:51.760]  I don't want to go for this
[23:51.760 --> 23:52.540]  extra knobbly one.
[23:52.640 --> 23:52.660]  No, no.
[23:52.820 --> 23:54.740]  Get a classic Cheezy.
[23:54.860 --> 23:55.040]  Yeah.
[23:55.160 --> 23:56.480]  You don't like a knobbly one?
[23:56.760 --> 23:57.640]  Well, I just don't want to...
[23:57.640 --> 23:58.340]  That's a good-looking one
[23:58.340 --> 23:58.800]  that Becca has.
[23:58.880 --> 23:59.560]  I don't want the race shit
[23:59.560 --> 23:59.880]  to be off.
[23:59.880 --> 24:00.420]  I like how everyone
[24:00.420 --> 24:01.160]  just holds them up.
[24:01.260 --> 24:01.420]  Yeah.
[24:02.240 --> 24:03.940]  This is the most Cheeto-ass
[24:03.940 --> 24:05.340]  fucking smell in the world, too.
[24:05.480 --> 24:05.700]  Oh, God.
[24:05.920 --> 24:06.480]  No, it's not.
[24:06.820 --> 24:08.000]  No, this smells like Play-Doh.
[24:08.600 --> 24:09.680]  Oh, it does have a little Play-Doh.
[24:09.840 --> 24:10.480]  It smells like Play-Doh?
[24:10.500 --> 24:11.460]  Oh, it does at the end.
[24:11.480 --> 24:11.840]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:11.960 --> 24:12.320]  Yeah.
[24:12.520 --> 24:12.860]  Interesting.
[24:12.960 --> 24:14.060]  Okay, you know what I do?
[24:14.240 --> 24:15.220]  I never thought about that,
[24:15.280 --> 24:15.640]  but you're right.
[24:15.860 --> 24:15.960]  Okay.
[24:16.180 --> 24:16.860]  There's a little bit of Play-Doh.
[24:16.860 --> 24:17.540]  All right, count us down, Andrew.
[24:18.280 --> 24:19.760]  Three, two, one.
[24:20.340 --> 24:20.700]  Enjoy.
[24:20.840 --> 24:21.400]  Oh, God.
[24:22.760 --> 24:23.480]  That is...
[24:23.480 --> 24:24.920]  The texture I wasn't expecting.
[24:24.920 --> 24:26.000]  That was like work to get.
[24:26.140 --> 24:28.280]  I will say, Geoff took one bite,
[24:29.100 --> 24:29.960]  picked up his phone,
[24:30.380 --> 24:31.300]  sent me a score.
[24:32.440 --> 24:33.040]  That was instant.
[24:33.040 --> 24:35.120]  That tastes like a stale...
[24:35.120 --> 24:35.700]  Yeah.
[24:35.940 --> 24:36.120]  Something.
[24:36.420 --> 24:37.360]  It's a stale Cheeto.
[24:38.400 --> 24:39.280]  These are...
[24:39.280 --> 24:39.580]  Is it stale?
[24:39.780 --> 24:41.160]  No, it's...
[24:41.160 --> 24:41.980]  I think that's the flavor.
[24:42.380 --> 24:43.760]  I think that's just what they are.
[24:44.180 --> 24:45.660]  I really do think that's what they are.
[24:45.700 --> 24:48.000]  I feel like every fifth bag of Cheetos,
[24:48.120 --> 24:50.380]  you'll find one Cheeto in the bag.
[24:50.520 --> 24:51.200]  That tastes like this.
[24:51.460 --> 24:52.220]  You're 100% right.
[24:52.240 --> 24:55.220]  That's why Cheetos are a superior chip,
[24:55.420 --> 24:57.440]  and these are Hawkins Cheezies,
[24:57.520 --> 24:59.340]  and they come in a bag like that.
[24:59.580 --> 25:02.440]  I will say, for a cheese crisp,
[25:02.440 --> 25:04.860]  the aftertaste isn't too bad.
[25:04.940 --> 25:07.280]  I feel like cheese can leave you with a mouthful of gack.
[25:07.540 --> 25:11.720]  This tastes like going to my friend Corey's house
[25:11.720 --> 25:13.240]  and swimming in his pool
[25:13.240 --> 25:14.820]  when I was like 8 years old.
[25:14.900 --> 25:16.000]  Does it taste like his gack?
[25:16.220 --> 25:17.260]  It tastes like...
[25:17.980 --> 25:19.880]  It tastes like Corey's gack.
[25:22.320 --> 25:22.740]  Weird.
[25:23.220 --> 25:24.740]  If you're saying these taste stale,
[25:24.940 --> 25:26.640]  I'm going to attribute that to the fact that
[25:26.640 --> 25:28.480]  they've been in Eric's office for 8 months.
[25:28.920 --> 25:30.340]  I don't think that that's a fair judgment.
[25:30.440 --> 25:30.940]  These are not stale.
[25:30.940 --> 25:32.120]  It's not stale.
[25:32.240 --> 25:33.340]  They're very...
[25:33.340 --> 25:35.620]  It's crispy in a corn snack way.
[25:35.640 --> 25:37.800]  These are well within their eat-by date.
[25:37.840 --> 25:39.080]  Did you look like this in his pool?
[25:39.560 --> 25:40.340]  Yeah, it was just about that.
[25:40.380 --> 25:41.260]  Here's what I'll say.
[25:41.380 --> 25:42.520]  Here's what I'll say for Hawkins.
[25:43.080 --> 25:47.340]  Best, I think, best of the container designs
[25:47.340 --> 25:48.540]  I've seen thus far.
[25:48.640 --> 25:49.620]  It's a well-crafted bag.
[25:49.640 --> 25:50.820]  It looks like we're going to the circus.
[25:50.920 --> 25:52.180]  It looks old-timey, in a good way.
[25:52.640 --> 25:53.900]  You don't like that one, Boston?
[25:54.300 --> 25:55.440]  Monster Munch is number 2.
[25:55.540 --> 25:57.140]  I hate Monster Munch so fucking much.
[25:57.360 --> 25:59.520]  I hate him. I hate that guy.
[25:59.520 --> 26:02.140]  I can't believe some of you are doing this without a beverage.
[26:02.560 --> 26:03.840]  I guess all of you have them.
[26:03.900 --> 26:05.100]  I need to actually refill my beverage.
[26:05.240 --> 26:05.480]  I'm going to do that.
[26:05.600 --> 26:06.040]  You want to step out real quick?
[26:06.040 --> 26:06.740]  Did you get something for Becca?
[26:07.760 --> 26:08.940]  Do y'all still have the...
[26:08.940 --> 26:10.840]  I'll take another Coke Zero, thanks.
[26:10.880 --> 26:12.420]  The green tea in the bottle.
[26:12.780 --> 26:14.260]  Love you. Stay sweet.
[26:16.520 --> 26:18.640]  Just water. Some kind of water.
[26:19.540 --> 26:21.220]  Gracie, what do you think of Hawkins Cheezies?
[26:21.980 --> 26:26.160]  I do like that, you know, you eat Cheetos and you have to dig your nails between your teeth to get out the residue.
[26:26.600 --> 26:27.200]  I don't have that.
[26:27.360 --> 26:28.380]  I do. I do.
[26:29.040 --> 26:29.400]  Really?
[26:29.640 --> 26:30.260]  I don't.
[26:30.320 --> 26:32.000]  I don't. Which is a pleasant surprise.
[26:32.160 --> 26:33.500]  I think it's the kind of teeth we have.
[26:33.500 --> 26:34.880]  But I don't. I still don't love them.
[26:35.900 --> 26:37.200]  They're saltier than Cheetos.
[26:37.260 --> 26:38.140]  Yeah, I like it.
[26:38.220 --> 26:41.700]  Hey, while Gavin's out of the room, we can all talk freely, right?
[26:41.800 --> 26:43.440]  His potato chips were dog shit.
[26:43.580 --> 26:44.060]  Yeah, pretty bad.
[26:44.080 --> 26:47.100]  The only one that was good was the one he didn't order.
[26:47.480 --> 26:48.260]  I gave a zero.
[26:48.880 --> 26:49.440]  Oh, really?
[26:49.620 --> 26:50.900]  Yeah, I gave a fucking zero.
[26:51.860 --> 26:53.320]  It's a straight up zero.
[26:53.380 --> 26:55.940]  I mean, I just can't believe he brought that to the table.
[26:55.940 --> 26:59.260]  I mean, this is like the worst pretzel invitation.
[26:59.640 --> 27:01.700]  I mean, you wouldn't bring a pretzel to this contest.
[27:01.860 --> 27:02.280]  No, no.
[27:02.280 --> 27:02.820]  This is here.
[27:02.920 --> 27:03.880]  No, because you're not an asshole, right?
[27:03.900 --> 27:05.640]  He's going to have to cancel his trip.
[27:07.020 --> 27:08.260]  He can't go back to the country.
[27:09.120 --> 27:09.600]  He can't.
[27:09.780 --> 27:13.240]  I will say, while we're waiting, keep eating these Hawkins Cheezys.
[27:13.240 --> 27:14.360]  Dude, I love these things.
[27:14.460 --> 27:14.980]  I'm not against them.
[27:14.980 --> 27:15.960]  They're really good.
[27:16.120 --> 27:17.480]  I'm not anti-Hawkins Cheesy.
[27:17.740 --> 27:19.060]  It's the Cheeto that crunches back.
[27:19.400 --> 27:19.640]  Okay.
[27:21.420 --> 27:22.320]  They should use that.
[27:23.520 --> 27:24.220]  Write them an email.
[27:24.220 --> 27:27.480]  No, but then they would catch on and people would want them to make more.
[27:29.180 --> 27:32.420]  I'm going to have to read about their whole business model after this.
[27:32.740 --> 27:37.140]  I do think the last time, it says 2019 on there, and I think that might be the last time they made these.
[27:37.600 --> 27:39.320]  They're just working off like the same batch.
[27:40.940 --> 27:46.380]  They're just going, this is pre-COVID Hawkins Cheezys, and they don't want to make any post-COVID Hawkins Cheezys.
[27:46.580 --> 27:49.000]  I wish they tasted as good as the bag looks.
[27:50.020 --> 27:50.580]  Hey, Geoff.
[27:50.760 --> 27:50.940]  Yeah.
[27:51.080 --> 27:52.160]  Just, they do.
[27:53.260 --> 27:54.340]  I'd say better.
[27:56.680 --> 27:57.120]  Okay.
[27:58.580 --> 27:59.400]  No Coke Zero?
[27:59.920 --> 28:00.480]  Oh, did you want one?
[28:02.980 --> 28:03.640]  Well, you grabbed two.
[28:03.680 --> 28:04.200]  Dude, that was cool.
[28:05.000 --> 28:06.240]  Eric just flipped my glasses.
[28:06.700 --> 28:10.360]  So, Gavin brought me a glass of water in a red Soluka.
[28:11.000 --> 28:11.180]  Yeah.
[28:11.720 --> 28:19.900]  And while in the UK, I learned that one of the most common questions people have about Americans is, do you really drink out of red plastic cups?
[28:20.340 --> 28:20.600]  Really?
[28:20.700 --> 28:20.920]  Yeah.
[28:20.920 --> 28:21.800]  Why do they ask that?
[28:21.920 --> 28:23.640]  It's just such a thing in the media.
[28:23.980 --> 28:24.380]  Yeah.
[28:25.580 --> 28:28.240]  That's the most fucking white trash thing, too.
[28:28.440 --> 28:29.300]  Yes, it is.
[28:29.320 --> 28:29.980]  How the fuck?
[28:30.220 --> 28:30.840]  Thanks, bud.
[28:32.220 --> 28:33.980]  Here comes Nick to get one.
[28:37.880 --> 28:38.820]  Greek style.
[28:39.580 --> 28:39.860]  Okay.
[28:41.100 --> 28:43.220]  Andrew, what is your next tip?
[28:43.860 --> 28:44.760]  Oh, this is tough.
[28:45.320 --> 28:49.060]  We're going to go with the Ruffles all dressed is the next one.
[28:49.060 --> 28:51.500]  Man, I was going to be so disappointed if these weren't here.
[28:51.740 --> 28:53.620]  This is an iconic Canadian chip.
[28:54.300 --> 28:55.460]  These are a classic.
[28:56.660 --> 29:00.540]  As a show that loves being in the lab, this is where these came from.
[29:00.740 --> 29:03.900]  They just decided one day, fuck it, why don't we just put every seasoning on a chip?
[29:04.060 --> 29:05.780]  Oh, I have a version of that as well.
[29:05.860 --> 29:14.940]  Yeah, it's definitely, this is an in the lab chip in a way where I think the first time I ever had these, I went, huh.
[29:15.520 --> 29:15.920]  Yeah.
[29:16.620 --> 29:17.400]  Pepper and onion?
[29:17.680 --> 29:17.960]  Oh.
[29:17.960 --> 29:23.820]  So it's been a while since I had these, but I remember it being like barbecue, but punched up.
[29:23.960 --> 29:26.980]  Like opposite direction of the barbecue chips we just had.
[29:27.100 --> 29:31.440]  These will taste like something unlike the other barbecue chips.
[29:31.680 --> 29:31.700]  Yes.
[29:32.180 --> 29:32.740]  Okay.
[29:33.320 --> 29:34.140]  Are you ready?
[29:34.680 --> 29:35.100]  All right.
[29:35.140 --> 29:35.760]  Count us down.
[29:36.420 --> 29:36.840]  Okay.
[29:37.360 --> 29:37.760]  Enjoy.
[29:38.000 --> 29:38.500]  Eat the chip.
[29:39.320 --> 29:39.740]  Now?
[29:40.100 --> 29:40.620]  Three, two, one, go.
[29:41.120 --> 29:41.300]  Oh.
[29:41.780 --> 29:42.100]  Whoa.
[29:46.080 --> 29:46.640]  Mmm.
[29:48.900 --> 29:49.840]  Not what I was expecting.
[29:51.300 --> 29:52.060]  Yeah, I like these.
[29:52.080 --> 29:52.680]  A lot of flavor.
[29:54.140 --> 29:55.540]  A lot of pulls in different directions.
[29:55.620 --> 29:56.680]  Ooh, I'd say a lot of flavor.
[29:56.900 --> 29:58.520]  I feel like this doesn't really know what it wants to be.
[29:59.740 --> 30:00.700]  I agree with you.
[30:00.960 --> 30:01.900]  Jack of all trades, master of math.
[30:01.900 --> 30:02.560]  What is this called again?
[30:02.700 --> 30:03.440]  I need to put it on my note.
[30:04.340 --> 30:05.380]  Ruffles all dressed.
[30:06.360 --> 30:07.620]  I love a ruffle chip.
[30:08.000 --> 30:08.900]  I love, they have ridges.
[30:09.120 --> 30:09.680]  I'm for it.
[30:09.820 --> 30:11.640]  And I can't do, I can't do decimals, right?
[30:11.760 --> 30:12.000]  No.
[30:12.280 --> 30:12.960]  Okay, all right.
[30:13.740 --> 30:14.960]  It is a...
[30:15.540 --> 30:15.740]  Hmm.
[30:16.180 --> 30:17.040]  It has some sweetness.
[30:17.040 --> 30:21.540]  It has like a barbecue sweetness, but it's almost like a salt and vinegar.
[30:21.680 --> 30:23.180]  There's a little bit of like an onion.
[30:23.700 --> 30:25.320]  There's definitely salt.
[30:25.600 --> 30:25.720]  Yeah.
[30:26.460 --> 30:27.260]  Very interesting.
[30:27.460 --> 30:27.980]  Very interesting.
[30:28.380 --> 30:28.880]  All right.
[30:28.940 --> 30:30.420]  I've rendered my score.
[30:30.560 --> 30:30.720]  That's pretty good.
[30:30.840 --> 30:31.240]  I like that.
[30:31.600 --> 30:31.860]  Yeah.
[30:32.180 --> 30:32.920]  It's a great chip.
[30:34.000 --> 30:34.880]  What do you think, Nick?
[30:35.440 --> 30:35.960]  It's good.
[30:36.040 --> 30:38.600]  It just feels like it's being pulled in a little too many directions.
[30:38.920 --> 30:39.300]  Mmm.
[30:39.320 --> 30:40.220]  To be perfect, you know?
[30:40.340 --> 30:40.840]  Stretched thin.
[30:41.120 --> 30:41.680]  That's fair.
[30:42.100 --> 30:42.320]  Okay.
[30:43.100 --> 30:43.500]  Okay.
[30:43.660 --> 30:43.880]  I see that.
[30:43.900 --> 30:44.180]  All right.
[30:44.300 --> 30:45.320]  And we have our final one.
[30:45.720 --> 30:46.500]  The final chip.
[30:46.640 --> 30:47.760]  Which of these is your favorite, by the way, Andrew?
[30:48.080 --> 30:50.040]  I would say the ketchup is my personal favorite.
[30:50.040 --> 30:50.700]  Oh my God.
[30:51.340 --> 30:52.240]  But they're all great.
[30:52.520 --> 30:53.760]  This is what I was hoping for, too.
[30:54.620 --> 30:55.320]  The Lay's ketchup.
[30:55.480 --> 30:55.660]  Here we go.
[30:55.700 --> 30:56.280]  Lay's ketchup.
[30:56.640 --> 30:58.800]  These were introduced in like 1983.
[30:59.400 --> 31:01.980]  They did a line where they're like, what if we make chips in other flavor?
[31:02.180 --> 31:04.300]  And they released grape, orange, and tomato.
[31:04.360 --> 31:04.900]  Oh my God.
[31:04.980 --> 31:06.920]  And tomato is the only one that took off.
[31:06.940 --> 31:08.480]  Wait, was it tomato or was it ketchup?
[31:09.100 --> 31:10.900]  I think it was originally called...
[31:10.900 --> 31:11.240]  They smell like ketchup.
[31:11.240 --> 31:13.940]  I think it's the same seasoning, but they just changed it from tomato to ketchup.
[31:13.940 --> 31:15.020]  Now, I love ketchup.
[31:15.280 --> 31:16.000]  It smells like...
[31:16.000 --> 31:16.580]  I've heard of these.
[31:16.660 --> 31:17.600]  Like English ketchup.
[31:17.740 --> 31:19.060]  I've never wanted to eat them.
[31:19.360 --> 31:21.140]  It doesn't seem like a combination that goes together.
[31:21.140 --> 31:22.360]  We talked about this today that you've never had it.
[31:22.380 --> 31:23.140]  Yeah, never in my life.
[31:23.160 --> 31:24.000]  So this is being new for me.
[31:24.020 --> 31:27.080]  Yeah, nobody ever mixes fried potato and ketchup ever.
[31:27.320 --> 31:28.020]  That's a really weird thing.
[31:28.020 --> 31:30.580]  I accidentally put one in my mouth and then promptly spit it out.
[31:32.560 --> 31:32.860]  Okay.
[31:33.600 --> 31:34.080]  Let's do it.
[31:34.140 --> 31:34.720]  Andrew, count us down.
[31:35.080 --> 31:35.300]  Yep.
[31:35.560 --> 31:35.820]  Okay.
[31:36.460 --> 31:37.180]  Enjoy the chip.
[31:38.320 --> 31:39.940]  This motherfucker does not know how to count backwards.
[31:40.220 --> 31:41.420]  No, I'm done with countdowns.
[31:41.420 --> 31:41.980]  I did it twice.
[31:42.120 --> 31:42.720]  We don't need to count.
[31:42.720 --> 31:43.000]  Ew.
[31:45.180 --> 31:45.860]  That's, uh...
[31:45.860 --> 31:46.800]  That is foul.
[31:46.920 --> 31:47.800]  I thought I liked these.
[31:47.960 --> 31:48.920]  I've gotten...
[31:48.920 --> 31:49.460]  I don't think I know.
[31:49.920 --> 31:51.200]  Oh, what is...
[31:51.200 --> 31:52.100]  That just keeps getting worse.
[31:52.340 --> 31:53.660]  I need to put more in to get rid of it.
[31:53.800 --> 31:53.920]  Uh-huh.
[31:54.180 --> 31:54.500]  Ew.
[31:54.960 --> 31:55.520]  I knew I wouldn't like that.
[31:55.520 --> 31:56.240]  You don't like this, Nick?
[31:57.740 --> 31:58.080]  No.
[31:58.500 --> 31:59.180]  I've never seen...
[31:59.180 --> 32:00.220]  That's a big condiment guy.
[32:00.340 --> 32:01.980]  It's a weird ketchup flavor.
[32:02.120 --> 32:02.700]  It's not...
[32:02.700 --> 32:04.360]  It's not too sweet.
[32:04.440 --> 32:05.600]  I can't place it.
[32:05.720 --> 32:06.400]  Yeah, they're eating more.
[32:06.400 --> 32:06.740]  It's like...
[32:06.740 --> 32:07.640]  It tastes like tomato paste.
[32:07.660 --> 32:08.060]  I'm trying to figure it out.
[32:08.060 --> 32:08.760]  It does.
[32:08.940 --> 32:09.680]  Yeah, there we go.
[32:10.880 --> 32:11.280]  Not sweet.
[32:11.280 --> 32:13.400]  It's like Gracie eating it and then saying immediately,
[32:13.680 --> 32:14.840]  I knew I wouldn't like this.
[32:17.720 --> 32:19.360]  All right, send me your scores.
[32:19.520 --> 32:20.280]  Geoff has sent his.
[32:20.340 --> 32:22.600]  That's like if ketchup came in a tin.
[32:23.060 --> 32:24.080]  Or some sort of can.
[32:24.320 --> 32:25.600]  Yeah, like canned ketchup.
[32:25.820 --> 32:25.980]  Yeah.
[32:26.380 --> 32:27.560]  Or tomato paste.
[32:28.080 --> 32:28.780]  Oh, yeah.
[32:28.900 --> 32:29.880]  A little bit like tomato paste.
[32:30.440 --> 32:30.820]  That's...
[32:30.820 --> 32:31.340]  You know, listen.
[32:31.400 --> 32:33.160]  You can come at me and my ketchup in a tin.
[32:33.380 --> 32:37.200]  At least none of my chips tasted like they came from a troll under a bridge.
[32:37.400 --> 32:37.680]  That's true.
[32:37.800 --> 32:38.700]  So I have that going for me.
[32:38.700 --> 32:40.760]  You have no cigarette-flavored...
[32:45.220 --> 32:46.840]  I think I'd rather do that than eat.
[32:47.120 --> 32:50.920]  It was unfortunate that Andrew said that right as I was typing my score.
[32:51.140 --> 32:51.220]  Yes.
[32:52.260 --> 32:55.040]  Now we'll hit that delete button one time.
[32:55.560 --> 32:57.120]  All right, let's move on to America.
[32:57.200 --> 32:58.840]  Okay, I have everyone's scores in.
[32:58.940 --> 33:02.100]  We've done scores for all of Gavin's, all of Geoff's.
[33:02.280 --> 33:03.280]  Or I'm sorry, all of Andrew's.
[33:03.400 --> 33:05.500]  And now, we will do Geoff's.
[33:06.900 --> 33:08.620]  God bless America.
[33:09.020 --> 33:10.140]  Which would you like to start with?
[33:10.140 --> 33:11.740]  Stand that I love.
[33:12.360 --> 33:15.380]  Stand beside me and guide me.
[33:15.800 --> 33:16.600]  I didn't know that line.
[33:16.760 --> 33:17.260]  Through the zaps.
[33:19.020 --> 33:20.040]  All right, we'll do zaps.
[33:20.080 --> 33:24.300]  We're going to start with a classic American zaps potato chip.
[33:24.380 --> 33:26.100]  We're going to do mesquite barbecue.
[33:26.820 --> 33:27.940]  Do we have enough for everybody, or should I...
[33:27.940 --> 33:29.640]  Open it up and pass it around.
[33:29.820 --> 33:30.340]  Is this your only zaps?
[33:30.840 --> 33:31.160]  What's that?
[33:31.220 --> 33:32.440]  Is this your only zaps flavor?
[33:33.340 --> 33:35.060]  Hey, Becca, we'll have to wait and see.
[33:35.280 --> 33:35.560]  Okay.
[33:35.720 --> 33:36.400]  Oh, my God.
[33:36.600 --> 33:37.700]  I can't.
[33:37.960 --> 33:39.060]  Oh, these are expired.
[33:39.060 --> 33:40.060]  Are they?
[33:40.960 --> 33:41.320]  Interesting.
[33:42.640 --> 33:43.500]  That's not my fault.
[33:43.960 --> 33:44.480]  How long ago?
[33:44.920 --> 33:45.960]  Oh, my God, Gavin.
[33:46.300 --> 33:46.780]  Two weeks.
[33:47.140 --> 33:47.300]  Oh.
[33:48.140 --> 33:49.060]  I have to point out...
[33:50.040 --> 33:51.220]  He definitely had to.
[33:52.040 --> 33:53.120]  Oh, green, that'll kill you.
[33:53.600 --> 33:53.880]  See that?
[33:55.520 --> 33:56.220]  See the green?
[33:56.320 --> 33:56.760]  There it is.
[33:56.860 --> 33:57.380]  It'll kill you.
[33:58.840 --> 33:59.200]  Okay.
[33:59.460 --> 34:00.640]  That's how you know it's a real potato.
[34:00.720 --> 34:01.720]  Geoff, you want to count us down?
[34:01.940 --> 34:02.560]  Three, two, one, go.
[34:02.680 --> 34:03.480]  You already ate it?
[34:03.540 --> 34:03.720]  Yeah.
[34:05.160 --> 34:06.240]  These are definitely expired.
[34:06.400 --> 34:08.500]  Yeah, they smell like old oil a little bit.
[34:09.200 --> 34:10.020]  These are 100%.
[34:10.020 --> 34:10.560]  These are expired.
[34:10.900 --> 34:12.720]  Now, that's not the chip's fault.
[34:13.620 --> 34:14.560]  You can asterisk this one.
[34:15.420 --> 34:16.560]  It still tastes pretty good.
[34:16.640 --> 34:17.880]  Put it against the knickknacks.
[34:18.260 --> 34:18.440]  Alright.
[34:19.260 --> 34:20.300]  You gotta send me your scores.
[34:20.320 --> 34:21.060]  Everybody send your scores.
[34:21.120 --> 34:21.540]  I sent mine.
[34:22.340 --> 34:22.440]  Hmm.
[34:23.740 --> 34:24.340]  Well, it's definitely...
[34:24.340 --> 34:24.780]  I'm trying to imagine.
[34:24.780 --> 34:25.420]  It's definitely barbecue.
[34:26.180 --> 34:26.540]  Yeah.
[34:26.880 --> 34:27.580]  Moving on.
[34:27.980 --> 34:28.780]  Why are you moving on?
[34:28.800 --> 34:29.400]  I need scores.
[34:29.400 --> 34:30.320]  No, I sent my scores.
[34:30.320 --> 34:30.560]  Yeah.
[34:31.160 --> 34:32.260]  Why are you trying to rush your quiz?
[34:32.260 --> 34:32.920]  Are you in a rush?
[34:33.240 --> 34:34.780]  No, I'm excited to eat good chips, finally.
[34:35.900 --> 34:37.920]  I need scores from Gavin and Andrew.
[34:37.920 --> 34:38.940]  Glenn, send your scores in.
[34:38.940 --> 34:41.700]  I'm just trying to imagine what they'd taste like if they weren't expired.
[34:42.200 --> 34:43.060]  Are yours expired too?
[34:43.680 --> 34:44.820]  They are as well, yes.
[34:49.140 --> 34:49.980]  That's how long.
[34:50.460 --> 34:51.740]  That's how we do it in America.
[34:51.980 --> 34:52.120]  Yeah.
[34:53.720 --> 34:55.980]  Alright, just need an Andrew score and then we're good to move on.
[34:56.120 --> 34:57.900]  I can't put my finger on what sucks about those.
[34:58.420 --> 34:59.240]  I think it's the expiration.
[35:00.100 --> 35:01.980]  Alright, what do we have next?
[35:02.340 --> 35:03.080]  Next we have...
[35:03.840 --> 35:04.880]  Gavin's already passing it around.
[35:05.000 --> 35:05.860]  We have kettle chips.
[35:05.880 --> 35:06.940]  Gavin, you're cross-contaminating.
[35:06.940 --> 35:08.180]  Kettle brand kettle chips.
[35:08.320 --> 35:11.980]  These are kettle brand jalapeno potato chips.
[35:12.260 --> 35:13.720]  Once again, a pure potato chip.
[35:14.240 --> 35:14.940]  This is now...
[35:15.780 --> 35:17.580]  Andrew told you about a little bit of spice.
[35:18.200 --> 35:21.100]  These are what actual potato chips with a little bit of spice taste like.
[35:21.100 --> 35:21.320]  Okay.
[35:21.760 --> 35:22.340]  You gonna count us down?
[35:22.660 --> 35:23.120]  No, he doesn't.
[35:23.600 --> 35:24.700]  He didn't count us down at all.
[35:27.620 --> 35:28.360]  It's a good crisp.
[35:28.780 --> 35:29.760]  They don't really have a lot of spice either.
[35:30.240 --> 35:30.940]  Oh, no, there it is.
[35:31.180 --> 35:32.560]  Yeah, they build and they get ya.
[35:32.680 --> 35:33.020]  They build.
[35:33.680 --> 35:34.320]  They're builders.
[35:34.320 --> 35:37.100]  I'd say a 1.5 to 2 second delay on that.
[35:39.120 --> 35:40.000]  Andrew, what do you think?
[35:40.540 --> 35:41.960]  I'm not a big spice guy.
[35:42.500 --> 35:42.840]  Uh-huh.
[35:43.280 --> 35:44.500]  I think it's a good chip.
[35:44.600 --> 35:45.700]  I just don't know about the seasoning.
[35:46.460 --> 35:48.500]  I think this is a great chip for somebody who's not me.
[35:48.940 --> 35:50.380]  Like, no disrespect to the chip.
[35:50.500 --> 35:51.960]  This just isn't something that I would get.
[35:52.260 --> 35:53.600]  These are very residue-y as well.
[35:53.700 --> 35:54.020]  They are.
[35:54.020 --> 35:55.160]  This will stay on you for hours.
[35:55.320 --> 35:55.760]  You want that.
[35:57.000 --> 35:57.780]  That's later licking.
[35:58.440 --> 35:59.300]  Just don't touch your eye.
[35:59.920 --> 36:01.680]  Well, you definitely should touch your eye and your dickhole.
[36:03.060 --> 36:04.800]  All right, I've sent my review in.
[36:05.160 --> 36:05.580]  Mine's in.
[36:06.400 --> 36:07.900]  Nick, what do you think about these?
[36:08.200 --> 36:08.780]  I like these.
[36:08.960 --> 36:13.820]  I think I like the other brand of jalapeno chips better, though.
[36:14.120 --> 36:14.660]  Miss Vicky's?
[36:14.720 --> 36:15.100]  I think so.
[36:15.240 --> 36:15.440]  Really?
[36:15.640 --> 36:15.880]  Yeah.
[36:16.260 --> 36:17.000]  I think they're too thin.
[36:17.740 --> 36:18.880]  They're a little spicier, though.
[36:19.000 --> 36:19.400]  They are.
[36:19.600 --> 36:19.740]  They are.
[36:19.900 --> 36:20.200]  Gracie?
[36:20.580 --> 36:20.900]  Oh, yeah.
[36:20.940 --> 36:21.580]  Please, Becca.
[36:22.320 --> 36:28.140]  I mean, I have two chips that I usually go for, and it's either salt and vinegar or jalapeno.
[36:28.460 --> 36:29.940]  So, I mean, I'm always a fan.
[36:30.900 --> 36:32.260]  Yeah, I think it's a great chip.
[36:32.600 --> 36:36.700]  I have to be in a mood, though, for the accumulated spice.
[36:37.300 --> 36:39.260]  But in this small portion, it's great.
[36:39.260 --> 36:40.280]  What put you in that mood?
[36:42.040 --> 36:43.220]  I don't know, a glass of milk?
[36:47.200 --> 36:48.320]  All right, should we move on?
[36:53.030 --> 36:53.990]  What are we doing next?
[36:54.250 --> 36:58.150]  All right, next up, we're going to do our version of the...
[36:58.150 --> 36:58.930]  What was it called?
[36:59.050 --> 36:59.690]  The Lay's...
[37:00.410 --> 37:00.730]  All Dressed.
[37:01.330 --> 37:02.170]  The All Dressed?
[37:02.490 --> 37:03.450]  This is Zapp's Voodoo.
[37:03.810 --> 37:05.010]  Zapp's appears twice on the list.
[37:05.010 --> 37:06.090]  I was holding my tongue.
[37:06.410 --> 37:07.570]  This is my favorite chip.
[37:07.790 --> 37:07.870]  Yeah.
[37:08.030 --> 37:09.530]  This is the Zapp's Voodoo.
[37:09.730 --> 37:09.990]  Of all time?
[37:10.010 --> 37:15.970]  What they did is they basically took all the Zapp's flavors and put them into one chip and called it Voodoo Chips, New Orleans style.
[37:16.470 --> 37:18.950]  Why are you taking so many chips when you eat three?
[37:20.830 --> 37:22.710]  I need to remember the other ones.
[37:23.550 --> 37:23.750]  Okay.
[37:23.930 --> 37:25.450]  All right, Geoff, are you going to count us down?
[37:25.530 --> 37:26.150]  Three, two, one.
[37:26.470 --> 37:26.730]  Go.
[37:29.760 --> 37:30.880]  Oh, my God, are these expired?
[37:31.300 --> 37:32.120]  Oh, my God.
[37:33.300 --> 37:34.860]  Oh, my God, these are very expired now.
[37:34.880 --> 37:35.860]  No, only barely.
[37:35.980 --> 37:38.020]  These are a month.
[37:38.180 --> 37:39.060]  Oh, these are missing it.
[37:39.600 --> 37:42.000]  Oh, these are July. 17th of July.
[37:42.240 --> 37:45.300]  And it's the 18th of July today on the recording.
[37:45.480 --> 37:46.300]  They still taste good, though.
[37:46.880 --> 37:47.600]  Yeah, they're still good.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.500]  It's interesting because the potato's expired, but the seasoning is not.
[37:50.540 --> 37:53.000]  So it tastes good until you focus on the chip itself.
[37:53.680 --> 37:54.540]  I think it's the oil.
[37:54.980 --> 37:56.580]  Like, it's always the oil that does it.
[37:56.580 --> 38:01.340]  I feel like my chips are going to be unfairly maligned because we got all expired chips.
[38:01.360 --> 38:02.220]  At least you got all your chips.
[38:02.400 --> 38:02.700]  That's true.
[38:03.460 --> 38:03.880]  That's true.
[38:04.020 --> 38:07.300]  Although the best fucking review thing you had was you're not chipping.
[38:07.920 --> 38:11.900]  I think these are going to score high, but I think these are an absolute disgrace.
[38:12.400 --> 38:13.860]  And I can't really put any more words into that.
[38:13.960 --> 38:15.140]  These are all over the place.
[38:15.460 --> 38:16.020]  They're good, though.
[38:16.440 --> 38:17.380]  Wait, what?
[38:18.640 --> 38:20.360]  I don't understand what you just said.
[38:20.740 --> 38:21.560]  They're going to score high.
[38:21.620 --> 38:22.440]  They're an absolute disgrace.
[38:22.520 --> 38:23.040]  They're good, though.
[38:23.160 --> 38:23.480]  Yeah.
[38:24.260 --> 38:25.060]  Why even bother?
[38:25.060 --> 38:25.740]  I don't know.
[38:25.780 --> 38:26.240]  I don't know.
[38:26.320 --> 38:27.280]  He did say all over the place.
[38:27.280 --> 38:29.500]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[38:29.780 --> 38:31.160]  Oh, never mind.
[38:31.240 --> 38:32.520]  It's like UK date format.
[38:32.520 --> 38:37.960]  Okay, so just so everyone knows, Becca was checking to see if the Monster Munch was expired
[38:37.960 --> 38:39.780]  because it fucking sucks so much.
[38:40.140 --> 38:41.380]  But, whoa, no.
[38:41.580 --> 38:42.640]  I liked the Monster Munch.
[38:43.000 --> 38:43.440]  Disgusting.
[38:43.980 --> 38:47.480]  Okay, I have scores from everyone now.
[38:48.340 --> 38:49.800]  And now we have one more chip.
[38:50.020 --> 38:51.180]  All right, the final chip.
[38:51.280 --> 38:53.900]  This has been my chip du jour of late.
[38:53.900 --> 38:55.460]  I discovered this recently.
[38:55.700 --> 38:58.980]  I have been slamming these back.
[38:59.060 --> 39:00.340]  Go ahead and share those, y'all.
[39:00.780 --> 39:01.640]  Eric, will you share with Gavin?
[39:01.940 --> 39:05.040]  This is Ruffles with queso.
[39:05.340 --> 39:05.760]  Oh, wow.
[39:05.900 --> 39:06.700]  Queso Ruffles.
[39:07.000 --> 39:07.900]  I've never even seen this.
[39:08.040 --> 39:09.680]  Classic ruffled potato chip.
[39:09.700 --> 39:10.880]  It's got the ridges.
[39:11.540 --> 39:12.540]  You can get these at HEB.
[39:12.660 --> 39:15.020]  You can get these at any grocery store in Texas.
[39:15.200 --> 39:15.940]  These have got a ton of them.
[39:15.940 --> 39:17.020]  So it's a Texas-specific release?
[39:17.280 --> 39:18.380]  There's a lot of smell.
[39:18.660 --> 39:19.560]  Oh, it's a Sabritas.
[39:19.580 --> 39:20.020]  They're intense.
[39:20.260 --> 39:20.920]  They are intense.
[39:20.920 --> 39:21.020]  Okay.
[39:21.440 --> 39:21.900]  You ready?
[39:22.300 --> 39:22.700]  Three.
[39:23.200 --> 39:24.580]  Just these two are expired.
[39:24.740 --> 39:25.140]  Two.
[39:26.220 --> 39:26.620]  One.
[39:29.580 --> 39:29.980]  Oh.
[39:31.020 --> 39:31.420]  I...
[39:31.420 --> 39:32.640]  I love it.
[39:32.720 --> 39:34.080]  It's the best potato chip you've ever had in your life, right?
[39:34.080 --> 39:34.520]  I love it.
[39:34.800 --> 39:35.620]  Holy shit, that's good.
[39:35.640 --> 39:37.460]  That seemed to find a new part of my tongue.
[39:39.400 --> 39:40.680]  Let me put my score in.
[39:41.500 --> 39:43.880]  Didn't Ruffles have like a cheddar flavor?
[39:44.060 --> 39:44.820]  Cheddar and sour cream.
[39:44.980 --> 39:45.160]  Yeah.
[39:45.480 --> 39:46.680]  It tastes exactly the same.
[39:46.900 --> 39:47.000]  Yeah.
[39:47.280 --> 39:48.260]  Oh, but cheesier.
[39:48.680 --> 39:49.520]  This is so cheesy.
[39:50.100 --> 39:51.360]  It is a very cheesy chip.
[39:51.380 --> 39:51.880]  With the Andrew Thompson.
[39:52.640 --> 39:53.860]  I don't know how I feel.
[39:54.240 --> 39:55.380]  I'm trying to figure it out.
[39:55.440 --> 39:55.860]  I don't...
[39:55.860 --> 39:56.320]  Yeah, I don't know how to score this.
[39:56.320 --> 39:56.960]  I think I like it.
[39:57.620 --> 39:59.040]  Immediately, I'm thinking just question mark.
[40:00.200 --> 40:01.180]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[40:01.480 --> 40:03.820]  Question marks naturally turn into tens after enough time.
[40:04.740 --> 40:05.600]  It looks like a seven.
[40:05.780 --> 40:09.240]  I think if I wasn't from this country, this would be a weird flavor to me.
[40:09.740 --> 40:10.500]  But if you are...
[40:10.500 --> 40:12.320]  Oh, I'm from this and I love this.
[40:12.380 --> 40:16.120]  Like, I can't open a big bag and not sit and finish the whole thing while I'm watching sports.
[40:16.280 --> 40:17.340]  Did you say you're from this?
[40:17.760 --> 40:18.620]  I'm for this.
[40:18.700 --> 40:18.820]  Oh.
[40:19.520 --> 40:20.480]  I'm from this.
[40:20.900 --> 40:21.440]  I'm from this.
[40:22.400 --> 40:25.040]  And these expired on July 18th.
[40:25.220 --> 40:25.800]  God damn.
[40:25.960 --> 40:26.600]  Well, that's today.
[40:27.020 --> 40:28.680]  Slightly fresher than the ones we just had.
[40:28.680 --> 40:30.180]  But the taste is still there.
[40:30.980 --> 40:31.740]  Yeah, they're really good.
[40:32.660 --> 40:34.140]  Imagine if all my chips were fresh.
[40:34.560 --> 40:37.300]  Imagine if any of my chips were fresh.
[40:37.360 --> 40:38.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[40:38.020 --> 40:42.260]  So, this just says guaranteed fresh until printed date.
[40:42.480 --> 40:43.060]  So, they're still fresh.
[40:43.140 --> 40:43.760]  They're still good.
[40:43.820 --> 40:44.800]  They're just not guaranteed.
[40:45.100 --> 40:45.340]  Okay.
[40:46.700 --> 40:51.040]  We have all of our scores in for every chip now.
[40:51.780 --> 40:54.680]  How would you like me to execute what we're doing here?
[40:55.060 --> 40:59.340]  Just before we do that, I just want to point out the stakes are you can never return home again.
[40:59.360 --> 40:59.840]  I don't know.
[40:59.920 --> 41:01.780]  That is something that you keep saying.
[41:02.420 --> 41:07.420]  I know, but in a contest in which the stakes couldn't be higher over half...
[41:07.420 --> 41:11.080]  Like, somebody had a bunch of expired chips and somebody didn't even have their chips.
[41:11.220 --> 41:11.700]  I just love it.
[41:12.120 --> 41:14.920]  And again, the chip that he did have, probably his best scoring chip.
[41:15.420 --> 41:19.040]  Eric, how would you rate your producing on this segment?
[41:19.120 --> 41:20.120]  Oh, I hate this segment.
[41:20.240 --> 41:21.160]  So, I'm 10 out of 10.
[41:21.240 --> 41:21.380]  Okay.
[41:21.640 --> 41:21.760]  Yeah.
[41:21.900 --> 41:22.220]  Interesting.
[41:22.540 --> 41:23.680]  I'm just going to stack you my score.
[41:23.940 --> 41:26.920]  I think my producing on this expired in June, so...
[41:28.800 --> 41:30.980]  You're guaranteed good producing up to the middle of July.
[41:31.160 --> 41:31.400]  Mm-hmm.
[41:32.660 --> 41:32.900]  All right.
[41:32.900 --> 41:33.860]  You want to combine the scores?
[41:33.940 --> 41:34.380]  You go, Gag?
[41:34.840 --> 41:36.660]  Gavin's combined score, Andrew's, and then Geoff's?
[41:37.120 --> 41:38.600]  So, we are looking at...
[41:39.980 --> 41:42.200]  Wow, these are going to be neck and neck in all of them, too.
[41:42.880 --> 41:47.200]  I will say, Gavin's chips...
[41:48.000 --> 41:57.140]  Gavin scored his Onion Monster Munch a 9, his Frazzles an 8, Nick Knock's an 8, and Twiglet's a 7.
[41:58.320 --> 42:02.900]  The Twiglets received a 1 from Andrew and a 0 from Geoff.
[42:03.460 --> 42:04.980]  Are you shitting my eye?
[42:05.220 --> 42:08.120]  Those are the lowest scores of the competition.
[42:08.460 --> 42:09.440]  A 0?
[42:09.440 --> 42:12.700]  I only gave you a 0 because I figured he would be a dick if I went negative.
[42:13.860 --> 42:14.920]  And that is true.
[42:15.140 --> 42:17.800]  If I would have gone negative 4, I would have gone negative 4.
[42:17.840 --> 42:18.780]  Eat that again and tell me it's a 0.
[42:18.940 --> 42:20.680]  I will. I'll eat it right fucking now.
[42:20.780 --> 42:22.860]  It looks like a chicken bone. I was about to say that.
[42:23.000 --> 42:23.920]  That tastes like shit.
[42:24.860 --> 42:31.980]  I am eating a crunchy cigarette. Not even a cigarette, a cigarette butt. This tastes like a crunchy cigarette butt.
[42:32.160 --> 42:34.200]  Listen to me. You hate white stuff, right? You hate milk.
[42:34.560 --> 42:34.880]  I do.
[42:34.920 --> 42:36.100]  I assume milk would be 0.
[42:36.560 --> 42:36.860]  Yeah.
[42:37.060 --> 42:38.020]  You're saying that's milk?
[42:38.020 --> 42:39.520]  You're saying that's the same as milk?
[42:39.620 --> 42:40.000]  Yeah, I am.
[42:40.540 --> 42:44.720]  Are there any non-lunatics in the room who would rate that higher than a 0?
[42:45.220 --> 42:52.680]  The only reason I gave it a 1 and not a 0 is because that wasn't the last of your chips and I didn't know if the bar could be lower.
[42:53.120 --> 42:58.280]  Like, I didn't know a chip bar could be that low, so I had to leave room for something being worse.
[42:58.440 --> 42:59.260]  Oh, they're so good.
[42:59.260 --> 43:03.480]  So, the Twiglets, across the board, was the lowest rated chip.
[43:04.240 --> 43:07.960]  Andrew rated the Pickled Onion Monster Munch a 3.
[43:08.840 --> 43:10.400]  Andrew, you're an animal today.
[43:11.000 --> 43:15.880]  I just don't... I'm not a big pickle guy, and that was very pickly. It was like pickle juice, the chip.
[43:16.320 --> 43:22.100]  The rest of it, pretty in the middle. Total combined score, 70.
[43:23.120 --> 43:25.900]  For adding everything up, putting them all together, 70.
[43:26.080 --> 43:26.900]  So that's where we're at there.
[43:26.920 --> 43:27.760]  Solid C minus.
[43:27.760 --> 43:29.380]  What did you score the Monster Munch?
[43:29.580 --> 43:30.340]  I think I gave them an 8.
[43:30.460 --> 43:31.920]  On the Monster Munch, you gave it an 8.
[43:32.140 --> 43:34.180]  I liked the Monster Munch. I quite liked it.
[43:35.040 --> 43:36.060]  Andrew's chips were second.
[43:37.040 --> 43:39.420]  Gavin gave the Lay's Ketchup a 4.
[43:39.960 --> 43:44.040]  I thought that was a fair low score. I didn't think 1's and 0's were flying around.
[43:44.660 --> 43:46.260]  That's how bad the Twiglet was.
[43:46.460 --> 43:46.920]  Wow, okay.
[43:48.040 --> 43:50.980]  If the ketchup is a 4, Twiglet, absolutely.
[43:51.180 --> 43:52.500]  Not trying to be a dick at all.
[43:52.500 --> 43:59.680]  So if you're like, wow, Gavin gave the Lay's Ketchup a 4, Geoff only gave it a 5.
[44:01.200 --> 44:04.640]  The Lay's Ketchup really underperformed.
[44:04.660 --> 44:06.600]  I expected Lay's Ketchup to be polarizing.
[44:07.160 --> 44:10.920]  And I wanted to like it. I like potato chips and I like ketchup.
[44:11.920 --> 44:14.700]  Geoff gave the Hawkins Cheezies a 4.
[44:14.940 --> 44:15.680]  Yeah, they were bad.
[44:16.600 --> 44:18.380]  I didn't like the flavor at all.
[44:19.120 --> 44:21.640]  But you're just talking about the cheese with the queso.
[44:21.640 --> 44:22.980]  Big cheese guy.
[44:23.000 --> 44:24.660]  Yeah, but this was fromage.
[44:28.720 --> 44:31.540]  Gavin gave the Old Dutch Barbecue a 5.
[44:32.160 --> 44:33.220]  Geoff gave it a 6.
[44:33.520 --> 44:34.600]  And Andrew gave it a 7.
[44:34.820 --> 44:37.080]  I just thought that was interesting that you're all bunched up there.
[44:37.400 --> 44:40.980]  I think it's interesting that Andrew brought a 7 to the contest.
[44:40.980 --> 44:42.220]  Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.
[44:43.260 --> 44:44.620]  I gave one 7, I think.
[44:45.360 --> 44:49.940]  I can't give 10's. I felt like it'd be an asshole if I just gave myself 10's across the board.
[44:49.940 --> 44:50.320]  Interesting.
[44:50.340 --> 44:51.540]  Could give me a 1 though.
[44:51.840 --> 44:52.240]  Interesting.
[44:52.500 --> 44:55.360]  So, the total combined score is 75.
[44:56.320 --> 44:57.720]  Just barely sweeped by.
[44:59.240 --> 45:02.840]  The Kettle Jalapeno for Geoff's chips.
[45:03.100 --> 45:03.920]  What about the All Dressed?
[45:04.520 --> 45:05.720]  That was my highest rated chip.
[45:05.840 --> 45:07.700]  The All Dressed, you gave an 8.
[45:08.420 --> 45:09.360]  Geoff gave an 8.
[45:09.860 --> 45:10.740]  And Gavin gave a 7.
[45:11.000 --> 45:12.420]  So the All Dressed was up there.
[45:12.500 --> 45:13.180]  I like the All Dressed.
[45:14.520 --> 45:18.720]  The Kettle Jalapeno, Andrew gave a 4.
[45:19.740 --> 45:20.140]  Wow.
[45:20.600 --> 45:21.340]  Gavin gave an 8.
[45:21.340 --> 45:22.360]  Just because I'm not a big spice guy.
[45:22.520 --> 45:23.420]  And Geoff gave a 10.
[45:23.940 --> 45:24.840]  And I stand by that 10.
[45:25.440 --> 45:26.460]  You gave yourself a 10, huh?
[45:26.540 --> 45:27.600]  I gave myself a couple 10's.
[45:29.240 --> 45:32.940]  In fact, Gavin, he gave himself 3 10's.
[45:32.960 --> 45:33.640]  You're an animal.
[45:33.780 --> 45:39.140]  The only one knocking off the 10, Zepp's Mesquite Barbecue, which Geoff gave a 9.
[45:39.200 --> 45:40.180]  Yeah, they were only a 9.
[45:40.700 --> 45:42.960]  I don't know if it's because they were expired or what, but they weren't a 10.
[45:43.040 --> 45:44.160]  They were all expired.
[45:44.780 --> 45:47.540]  I feel like, I mean, you scored like an American.
[45:47.540 --> 45:48.620]  It makes sense.
[45:48.640 --> 45:49.640]  I scored honestly.
[45:49.940 --> 45:52.360]  If yours would have been 10's, I would have given you 10's.
[45:52.700 --> 45:53.740]  There was no bias there.
[45:53.860 --> 45:54.440]  It's just flavor.
[45:54.720 --> 45:55.660]  I really don't care.
[45:55.800 --> 45:57.860]  Wait, what did Gavin give the Peanuts, the surprise?
[45:57.980 --> 46:00.100]  Oh, were the Peanuts my highest scoring one?
[46:00.800 --> 46:01.160]  Yes.
[46:01.460 --> 46:02.300]  I gave those an 8.
[46:02.520 --> 46:03.800]  Geoff gave them a 9.
[46:03.820 --> 46:04.240]  A 9, yeah.
[46:04.280 --> 46:06.540]  Andrew gave them a 7, which was his highest score.
[46:06.540 --> 46:07.200]  Well, I had the real product.
[46:07.360 --> 46:07.960]  Yeah, that's true.
[46:08.220 --> 46:10.140]  And, Gavin, you gave them an 8.
[46:10.560 --> 46:11.860]  See, I gave you a 9.
[46:11.980 --> 46:12.740]  I really believed that.
[46:12.740 --> 46:14.760]  They were as good as the barbecue pancakes I had.
[46:14.760 --> 46:16.700]  Yeah, they were the best chip that you didn't want.
[46:16.700 --> 46:18.840]  Yeah, from my home country of Cambodia.
[46:19.120 --> 46:19.760]  Or wherever that's from.
[46:19.800 --> 46:20.200]  Thailand.
[46:20.720 --> 46:20.960]  I don't know.
[46:21.660 --> 46:28.380]  The rest of the scoring for Geoff's chips, sort of 6's and 7's all around.
[46:28.740 --> 46:32.500]  A couple of 8's in there from Gavin and Andrew.
[46:33.260 --> 46:34.780]  Geoff's score, Ruffles Queso, 10.
[46:35.040 --> 46:36.180]  Kettle Jalapeno, 10.
[46:36.420 --> 46:37.680]  Zapp's Mesquite Barbecue, 9.
[46:37.860 --> 46:39.840]  Zapp's New Orleans Style Voodoo, 10.
[46:40.700 --> 46:45.800]  The score, the summation of his points, is 90.
[46:46.720 --> 46:51.740]  Wait, how's he getting 90 points? There's 4 bags of chips and there's 3 scores.
[46:52.160 --> 46:53.020]  How's he getting to 90?
[46:53.340 --> 46:56.240]  I'm adding everyone's scores together.
[46:57.280 --> 47:02.900]  6, 6, 10. 8, 4, 10. 6, 8, 9. 7, 6, 10.
[47:03.060 --> 47:04.840]  That is the way that these have all been scored.
[47:04.960 --> 47:09.520]  Who would have thought that having less Americans in the scoring would make it less fair?
[47:10.300 --> 47:11.260]  Very interesting.
[47:13.800 --> 47:19.420]  And I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free.
[47:19.580 --> 47:20.600]  Me and Lee Greenwood, baby.
[47:20.840 --> 47:25.960]  And I won't forget the men who died to give those chips to me.
[47:26.340 --> 47:30.500]  And I'll probably stand up and eat queso.
[47:31.380 --> 47:32.800]  Ruffles here today.
[47:33.140 --> 47:34.470]  So, I want to say...
[47:35.080 --> 47:37.280]  When it goes down, I love my chips.
[47:38.980 --> 47:39.780]  I'm done.
[47:40.380 --> 47:40.820]  Why?
[47:41.220 --> 47:43.020]  God bless the USA!
[47:43.620 --> 47:46.320]  I don't know why you would end before the last line.
[47:46.680 --> 47:50.400]  Here's the thing about the score. You're going like, wow, these sums are like crazy or whatever.
[47:51.180 --> 47:51.520]  They're fair.
[47:52.200 --> 47:54.520]  15 points off on Geoff's.
[47:54.580 --> 48:00.680]  The thing about Geoff's scores is that even if you knock Geoff down 2 points in his own scores,
[48:00.780 --> 48:05.720]  if you go like instead of 10, 10, 9, 10, you go like 8, 8, 7, 10.
[48:05.720 --> 48:07.940]  So if you deducted 8 points...
[48:07.940 --> 48:09.020]  Still doesn't fucking matter.
[48:09.020 --> 48:14.280]  Also, you gotta be... and I don't mean this as a personal assault to either of you, the British or the Canadian.
[48:14.560 --> 48:18.700]  You gotta be a real dumb motherfucker if you're bringing 7s and 8s to your own contest.
[48:19.940 --> 48:23.960]  Bring your own fucking 10s, man. You got a whole country. I'm sure there's 10s in your country.
[48:23.980 --> 48:24.880]  It just feels obnoxious.
[48:24.880 --> 48:25.800]  It's not a country of 7s.
[48:25.980 --> 48:27.860]  It feels obnoxious.
[48:28.060 --> 48:33.080]  I will give them a little benefit. Maybe not all of them were available for mail order.
[48:33.100 --> 48:33.520]  Oh, they were.
[48:34.100 --> 48:36.320]  Also, who knows if Eric even would have bought them.
[48:36.540 --> 48:39.180]  And also, I think the shapes are playing a big factor here.
[48:39.440 --> 48:40.540]  These are all very unique.
[48:40.920 --> 48:41.880]  A knick-knack also would have been unique.
[48:41.880 --> 48:43.340]  And you're holding three things that aren't potato chips.
[48:43.500 --> 48:45.480]  Yeah, who gives a fuck what they look like?
[48:45.820 --> 48:48.000]  I'm back. I'm eating Geoff's ruffles.
[48:49.740 --> 48:51.380]  They're here. Oh boy, I'm into it.
[48:51.440 --> 48:52.660]  Their queso are so good, man.
[48:53.580 --> 48:55.620]  Nick is going crazy on the Hawkins Cheezies.
[48:55.660 --> 48:56.240]  I like them.
[48:56.760 --> 48:58.100]  Dude, I got a whole bag here for you.
[48:58.780 --> 49:00.100]  That's such a dense bag.
[49:00.100 --> 49:02.920]  I mean, we'll obviously have to come back for the knick-knacks one day.
[49:03.020 --> 49:03.580]  The proper ones.
[49:03.720 --> 49:04.660]  Yeah, maybe we'll do that in an episode.
[49:04.660 --> 49:05.760]  You can bring them back from England.
[49:06.200 --> 49:07.440]  Yeah, I'll do that.
[49:07.560 --> 49:12.900]  Maybe we'll do another round where the American ones I pick no chips.
[49:12.980 --> 49:15.700]  I just pick shit like pretzels and Cheetos and Fritos.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.020]  And then you pick actual potato chips this time.
[49:18.760 --> 49:21.920]  Y'all should try to bring your worst and aim for the lowest score.
[49:22.460 --> 49:24.640]  Oh, God, that's such a face move.
[49:24.800 --> 49:25.800]  That's a really good idea.
[49:26.760 --> 49:28.220]  Can I have Eric's job?
[49:30.140 --> 49:30.580]  Absolutely.
[49:32.760 --> 49:35.100]  So, I'm not sure what we learned here.
[49:35.660 --> 49:39.780]  I think I had what I confirmed my thought about American chips.
[49:39.920 --> 49:40.880]  They're very average.
[49:41.140 --> 49:43.240]  Like, I think Geoff won on averageness.
[49:43.380 --> 49:46.720]  Like, he didn't take any swings for the fences as far as flavor.
[49:46.780 --> 49:49.660]  He won by 15 points.
[49:49.760 --> 49:51.880]  I don't know what you're talking about, didn't take any swing for the fences.
[49:52.300 --> 49:54.200]  I had a queso-specific chip.
[49:54.360 --> 49:56.040]  You've never even heard of that before, motherfucker.
[49:56.620 --> 50:00.320]  A very popular cheese flavor is a swing for the fences.
[50:00.520 --> 50:02.220]  How many queso chips do you got up there in Canada?
[50:02.780 --> 50:04.160]  None. That's the whole point of this.
[50:04.580 --> 50:06.540]  Motherfucker, but we have a ton in America.
[50:06.760 --> 50:09.560]  I picked a classic barbecue, which ended up being the worst one.
[50:09.800 --> 50:13.620]  I picked an everything chip, which you also picked, so don't get slightly on that.
[50:13.620 --> 50:14.640]  Yeah, I give you credit for everything.
[50:15.160 --> 50:17.400]  And then I picked a spicy motherfucking chip.
[50:17.760 --> 50:21.220]  I will say, even though I scored mine more reserved,
[50:21.380 --> 50:24.440]  I'm way more excited to walk past a shelf of crisps in England
[50:24.440 --> 50:28.420]  and pick out these things than the more bland shit that I find in H-E-B.
[50:28.540 --> 50:32.280]  You are overwhelmed by bad choices in England.
[50:32.360 --> 50:35.960]  You're like a Shapes guy. You're definitely like a Shapes guy.
[50:36.060 --> 50:39.800]  Yeah, I mean, one of the ones I could have brought was the one where you build a tiny crisp car.
[50:40.320 --> 50:40.620]  What?
[50:40.680 --> 50:41.960]  Yeah, but why didn't you bring that?
[50:42.140 --> 50:47.240]  If your country focused more on the flavor and less on the shape,
[50:47.380 --> 50:49.360]  then you might have done better in the contest.
[50:50.060 --> 50:52.500]  That is the thing. You have great names.
[50:52.500 --> 50:54.380]  You definitely win on names.
[50:54.440 --> 50:55.980]  Over-index on names. For sure.
[50:55.980 --> 50:59.140]  I can't believe that I ordered knick-knacks and they sent me knick-knocks.
[51:01.520 --> 51:03.680]  I showed you the link. It's the link you sent.
[51:03.860 --> 51:05.180]  I ordered that.
[51:05.580 --> 51:06.340]  Yeah, you got screwed there.
[51:06.640 --> 51:07.780]  Amazon does that shit.
[51:07.980 --> 51:11.240]  Yeah, the guy went knick-knack. Oh, shit, I'm out of knick-knacks. Fuck them. Knick-knocks.
[51:11.440 --> 51:13.060]  Where are they, by the way? Where are the knick-knocks?
[51:13.300 --> 51:14.200]  I'm sure Nick has them.
[51:15.440 --> 51:16.520]  Amazon does that shit.
[51:16.520 --> 51:19.940]  I bought a bag, a box of baseball cards from Amazon the other day,
[51:20.020 --> 51:23.900]  and I got a yoga roller and a pair of sweatpants.
[51:24.120 --> 51:25.820]  That's not close at all.
[51:25.820 --> 51:26.460]  Even close to what I ordered.
[51:26.640 --> 51:28.620]  Andrew, what do you think your conclusions are here?
[51:28.720 --> 51:31.360]  What's your final sort of thoughts?
[51:31.740 --> 51:35.180]  I'm never going to buy chips in Europe, anywhere overseas.
[51:35.240 --> 51:35.740]  Don't blame you.
[51:37.160 --> 51:39.420]  American chips are as bland as I assumed.
[51:39.760 --> 51:41.240]  Like, they're just inoffensive. They're fine.
[51:42.480 --> 51:43.580]  It says that...
[51:44.220 --> 51:45.700]  It's too spicy for me.
[51:50.720 --> 51:52.440]  And I'm happy with what I have.
[51:53.000 --> 51:58.060]  I think Gavin and I win on adventurousness in the chip realm.
[51:58.380 --> 51:59.400]  Oh my god.
[51:59.420 --> 51:59.600]  Yeah.
[52:00.100 --> 52:01.520]  Which is what I'm looking for in a chip.
[52:02.280 --> 52:04.760]  I prefer the adventure of winning.
[52:06.420 --> 52:08.340]  Says the guy who gave himself tens.
[52:08.600 --> 52:10.340]  Yeah, because I brought tens!
[52:10.660 --> 52:12.900]  Why do you sandbag your own fucking score?
[52:13.260 --> 52:14.220]  Come on, man!
[52:14.500 --> 52:15.460]  It's such an American rule.
[52:15.460 --> 52:17.160]  Why the fuck believe in your own country?
[52:17.160 --> 52:22.640]  To be fair, I rarely enter competitions expecting to win, so I'm absolutely fine with it.
[52:23.220 --> 52:25.840]  That's because you British and you guys don't expect to win!
[52:25.980 --> 52:27.820]  In America, we expect to win!
[52:28.220 --> 52:29.340]  You brought Twiglets.
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.380]  And I'm proud of that choice.
[52:31.400 --> 52:33.900]  I think Gavin brought a personal journey here.
[52:35.260 --> 52:37.240]  Christmas 1992, that is. Right there.
[52:37.580 --> 52:37.800]  Yeah.
[52:38.360 --> 52:39.860]  That was a rough year for you, huh?
[52:41.560 --> 52:42.140]  You're glad you have Twiglets?
[52:42.140 --> 52:45.040]  Was that the year you got your brother's hand-me-up bicycle for Christmas?
[52:45.040 --> 52:47.380]  I agree with that. Like, I'm glad I had that.
[52:47.780 --> 52:52.260]  Yeah, I will never have them again, but I feel like that's sort of the point of this.
[52:52.340 --> 52:57.360]  It's like bringing in flavors that are region-specific that he enjoys, but we don't.
[52:57.400 --> 52:59.720]  Because we don't eat dirt, typically.
[52:59.980 --> 53:02.140]  But they do, I guess. And that's fine.
[53:03.820 --> 53:06.980]  The total combined score for Twiglets was eight.
[53:07.320 --> 53:09.540]  And seven of those points are Gavin's.
[53:13.140 --> 53:17.220]  Everyone else is up in, like, the 20s, and it really is eight for Twiglets.
[53:17.220 --> 53:19.240]  I don't think zero should have been allowed. That's just nothing.
[53:19.340 --> 53:23.980]  Okay, we give you one, it'll be nine. Bring you up to a cool 71.
[53:25.780 --> 53:28.760]  Oh, man. Well, I think we've done it.
[53:28.820 --> 53:30.900]  Yeah, will you take us out from this thing?
[53:30.900 --> 53:34.760]  Thanks for tuning in to another piece of supplemental f***face content.
[53:34.900 --> 53:37.020]  We hope you enjoyed the chip challenge.
[53:37.020 --> 53:41.080]  Maybe you have some chips from your local location that you're really into.
[53:41.200 --> 53:44.640]  And if you do, that's cool for you. I don't know that I give a s***, but I'm happy for you.
[53:44.740 --> 53:45.760]  Do your own with your friends.
[53:45.760 --> 53:49.040]  Oh, yeah, do your own with your friends. And here's the real deal. Let us know.
[53:49.280 --> 53:51.840]  Tell us what your favorite chips are. We want to know. We want to try them.
[53:52.020 --> 53:57.720]  If we covered something from England, or if we missed something from England and the UK because of poor ambassadorship,
[53:58.140 --> 54:00.160]  let us know what else we should be trying.
[54:00.200 --> 54:01.580]  I could do another whole round of this.
[54:01.740 --> 54:03.000]  I'm sure we all could.
[54:03.820 --> 54:06.720]  We could definitely do that, Gracie. I wouldn't need you to order a bunch of chips.
[54:06.720 --> 54:08.360]  Maybe you should bring some tins this time.
[54:08.460 --> 54:12.800]  And then we'll go ahead and get unexpired American chips.
[54:12.980 --> 54:13.980]  Maybe that would be awesome, too.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.340]  We could just probably go get these at the store.
[54:16.940 --> 54:22.760]  I'd be interested to know from the comment leavers if anyone has experienced this unique collection of chips.
[54:23.140 --> 54:24.940]  Who they think has won.
[54:25.580 --> 54:28.620]  And a special thank you to Eric and Becca.
[54:28.740 --> 54:34.300]  Eric, thank you for letting Becca be the one-time regulation.
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.320]  Cast variance dispensation.
[54:36.520 --> 54:38.400]  And Becca, thank you for sitting in and eating some potato chips with us.
[54:38.640 --> 54:39.720]  Sorry about your kids.
[54:41.340 --> 54:42.740]  Sorry about your damn kids.
[54:42.860 --> 54:44.240]  Every parent gets one, like, gimme.
[54:44.560 --> 54:45.360]  It's true, it's true.
[54:46.940 --> 54:49.380]  Follow us at f***facepodcast on Instagram and on Twitter.
[54:49.880 --> 54:53.100]  r slash f***facepodcast is a subreddit we don't run, but it's there.
[54:53.360 --> 54:54.100]  You can check it out.
[54:54.800 --> 54:56.440]  Do a chip challenge with your friends.
[54:58.000 --> 54:58.600]  Go ahead.
[54:58.720 --> 55:00.840]  Oh, and also listen to my new podcast, So I'll Write.
[55:00.940 --> 55:02.020]  It's also a tin.
[55:02.780 --> 55:03.380]  Hmm.
[55:03.960 --> 55:05.080]  Can I write a chip?
[55:05.780 --> 55:06.080]  Absolutely.
[55:07.340 --> 55:10.420]  It might be the twiglets of podcasting.
[55:10.480 --> 55:11.300]  We don't know.
[55:12.620 --> 55:14.580]  Real weird aftermath on that podcast.
[55:18.820 --> 55:19.420]  Goodbye.
