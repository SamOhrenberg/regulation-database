[00:10.210 --> 00:15.530]  Hello, and we are here with another piece of supplemental content that Geoff and Gavin don't know about,
[00:15.610 --> 00:20.810]  even though I probably should have talked to you about this, because it's mainly around something you guys do more than me.
[00:21.270 --> 00:22.950]  But it is an idea we talked about in the past.
[00:22.970 --> 00:25.330]  What's your name? Who are you?
[00:25.690 --> 00:27.310]  What? Who am I? I'm Andrew.
[00:27.510 --> 00:28.490]  Okay, what's up, Andrew?
[00:29.650 --> 00:32.830]  Who am I? Who are you asking questions to?
[00:34.170 --> 00:42.070]  I'm Andrew, you're Geoff, person asking about names, and then Gavin, who is very normal and boring, is also here.
[00:42.350 --> 00:44.190]  Not a good bit. It's not.
[00:45.290 --> 00:47.550]  I agree, but he seems to like it.
[00:48.630 --> 00:51.110]  It wasn't supposed to be boring, it was supposed to be normal.
[00:55.070 --> 01:00.310]  So I have pulled, because you guys just did a whole run of Does It Do episodes.
[01:00.450 --> 01:00.790]  Yes, we did.
[01:00.790 --> 01:10.130]  And we've talked about in the past, it would be kind of cool to do a show where we watch infomercial type stuff to source the products.
[01:10.390 --> 01:11.450]  So that's what this is.
[01:11.550 --> 01:19.050]  Because it's also tough to find products, as you mentioned Geoff, you can find ads for things, but then actually finding the product itself is a hurdle.
[01:19.470 --> 01:23.230]  So these are all things, I scoured a bunch of websites for As Seen On TV.
[01:23.390 --> 01:29.610]  These are some of the weirder things I was able to find, and I've also sourced where we could buy all of these things.
[01:29.610 --> 01:36.090]  So if we wanted to, we could acquire them, and then it could be maybe a future thing on Does It Do.
[01:36.590 --> 01:39.470]  So this is essentially like, is this worth doing?
[01:39.650 --> 01:41.130]  Is sort of the premise of this.
[01:41.130 --> 01:42.710]  So it's like, is it do, and then does it do?
[01:42.710 --> 01:42.950]  Is it?
[01:43.610 --> 01:44.010]  Yes!
[01:44.170 --> 01:44.770]  Do we do?
[01:45.050 --> 01:47.150]  Do we do?
[01:47.290 --> 01:47.730]  Do we do?
[01:47.930 --> 01:49.050]  Yes we do, does it do?
[01:49.070 --> 01:49.730]  Yes it do.
[01:50.050 --> 01:54.270]  This supplemental piece is called Do We Do.
[01:55.050 --> 01:55.450]  Yes.
[01:55.450 --> 02:11.250]  And I feel like we should preface this by saying, Andrew, you may not realize how hard it is to find these products, because you do see them on TV all the time, but we are assuming that they're difficult to find, probably because most of them got sued into oblivion.
[02:11.550 --> 02:12.370]  Probably, yes.
[02:12.510 --> 02:12.690]  Yeah.
[02:12.690 --> 02:20.970]  So these are some I compiled, maybe we will like them, maybe there are some that you guys want to go forward with, maybe there are none, we'll just find out.
[02:21.030 --> 02:25.630]  At least a lot of these I think are amusing videos, at the very least, that we can watch and make fun of.
[02:25.790 --> 02:31.730]  And it should be included in the video version of this show, so if people want to watch along with us, they will be able to do so.
[02:31.850 --> 02:31.970]  Yep.
[02:32.410 --> 02:37.750]  I think these should release also after whatever the next season of Does It Do is.
[02:38.150 --> 02:41.950]  Because part of the joy for me in watching it is not expecting what the product will be.
[02:41.950 --> 02:45.130]  Kind of going along with it, so I think this will be a post thing, but anyway.
[02:45.810 --> 02:49.350]  We ready to start on the first potential Does It Do?
[02:49.590 --> 02:49.990]  Do we do?
[02:50.710 --> 02:51.050]  Do we do?
[02:51.050 --> 02:51.990]  Do we do? Thank you.
[02:52.010 --> 02:52.090]  Do we do?
[02:52.610 --> 02:53.850]  Okay. Ready?
[02:54.330 --> 02:54.570]  Yep.
[02:54.810 --> 02:55.050]  Yeah.
[02:55.630 --> 02:56.490]  Egg-sitter, here we go.
[02:57.790 --> 02:58.950]  That's my back for sure.
[03:04.740 --> 03:05.100]  Dude.
[03:06.320 --> 03:07.200]  Did that lady just lay an egg?
[03:07.200 --> 03:07.820]  You can sit on an egg.
[03:08.080 --> 03:08.960]  That's awesome.
[03:09.020 --> 03:10.300]  You want me to sit on this egg?
[03:10.460 --> 03:11.360]  Yes, we do.
[03:11.520 --> 03:12.720]  Oh god, we have to do this.
[03:12.720 --> 03:14.040]  She's jumping at the chance.
[03:14.140 --> 03:15.040]  No way.
[03:15.100 --> 03:16.160]  She doesn't feel it.
[03:16.360 --> 03:18.300]  She didn't feel it in her ass cracking?
[03:18.680 --> 03:20.660]  And then the guy's just touching it?
[03:21.600 --> 03:23.320]  That's a good cushion right there.
[03:24.560 --> 03:25.960]  We have to do this.
[03:29.280 --> 03:32.420]  There's no way that doesn't break on Gavin, right?
[03:32.840 --> 03:36.060]  Gavin is going to be the only one who sits on the egg and it crushes.
[03:36.820 --> 03:38.800]  Why am I going to be the one to crush it?
[03:38.980 --> 03:39.760]  I don't know.
[03:41.840 --> 03:42.880]  Not egg-sitter.
[03:43.180 --> 03:44.400]  Not the egg-sitter.
[03:44.860 --> 03:46.280]  Look at the hexagonal pattern.
[03:47.080 --> 03:49.580]  Look at it, it's got your butt cheeks and your balls, pressure point.
[03:49.600 --> 03:52.340]  Look, he's trying to break with the kit, you can't even break it that way.
[03:52.740 --> 03:55.120]  We should do like a running jump and see if it breaks.
[03:57.720 --> 03:59.200]  What does that do for your back though?
[03:59.620 --> 04:00.280]  It helps.
[04:01.760 --> 04:03.900]  It puts bubbles in your ass, apparently.
[04:06.720 --> 04:07.520]  It's effervescent.
[04:07.980 --> 04:09.140]  Look at how durable it is.
[04:09.140 --> 04:09.880]  You can air it out.
[04:12.780 --> 04:14.520]  The mall! They're at the mall!
[04:14.720 --> 04:15.760]  Cause it's back.
[04:15.940 --> 04:16.860]  Oh, baby.
[04:21.080 --> 04:22.420]  She's rubbing that egg in.
[04:22.700 --> 04:23.780]  Is she on the egg now?
[04:25.480 --> 04:27.840]  I think she's officially dating that egg now.
[04:28.240 --> 04:29.820]  That was okay.
[04:30.140 --> 04:35.140]  The most disturbing thing was the dude picking up the egg from someone else's ass cracker and then cracking it into the bowl.
[04:35.420 --> 04:36.460]  Without gloves.
[04:37.580 --> 04:45.480]  It has, of all the videos that we've done, I just want to say it has the best acting in it for me, by far.
[04:45.860 --> 04:48.440]  Like, these are clearly people that are just in the mall shopping.
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.580]  And I assume immediately after they did that, they filled out whatever questionnaire Family Feud has.
[04:54.700 --> 04:55.620]  Like, it's the same energy.
[04:55.960 --> 04:58.800]  Like, those are the people that provide the data for that show too.
[05:00.860 --> 05:02.560]  I do think we have to do that.
[05:02.580 --> 05:03.680]  I do think so as well.
[05:03.780 --> 05:04.720]  I think we would do.
[05:04.720 --> 05:09.700]  I mean, to me, I have so many ideas that I want...
[05:09.700 --> 05:14.260]  Are you also thinking about covering Gavin in those and then throwing eggs at him as hard as you can?
[05:15.380 --> 05:18.440]  I'm immediately thinking the running jump onto the egg.
[05:18.540 --> 05:20.220]  I'm immediately thinking ostrich egg.
[05:20.380 --> 05:23.060]  Yeah, you go bigger egg, smaller egg.
[05:23.740 --> 05:29.080]  Like, how many can you stack up before you put the egg underneath it?
[05:29.520 --> 05:30.400]  Get on a ladder.
[05:30.560 --> 05:33.600]  Like, how high on the ladder can you jump off onto the... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:34.320 --> 05:41.440]  Geoff, were you suggesting that you, like, attach eggs to each other and then slap each other with that to try to break the eggs that way?
[05:41.580 --> 05:41.960]  Like, what?
[05:42.140 --> 05:44.640]  Could you break the eggs with, like, a slap?
[05:44.860 --> 05:45.800]  No, I wasn't.
[05:46.140 --> 05:48.780]  Take eggs to our foreheads and slam each other with it.
[05:49.360 --> 05:50.340]  That's a good idea.
[05:50.740 --> 05:52.200]  Suggesting that, but I am now, yeah.
[05:52.520 --> 05:54.800]  Because if you don't want to do it to your face, I understand.
[05:55.320 --> 06:05.080]  You put eggs all over your back and then see if, like, somebody else swings it like a WWF steel chair and see if you're gonna break the eggs across your back.
[06:05.080 --> 06:06.280]  Or just glue onto a chair.
[06:07.360 --> 06:12.240]  What if we put, like, a chest piece on my chest and a chest piece on Gavin's?
[06:12.460 --> 06:17.680]  And then we have Eric, you throw the egg up, and then we slam into each other as hard as we can.
[06:17.940 --> 06:18.840]  Yeah, with a chest bump.
[06:19.720 --> 06:20.140]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:20.480 --> 06:21.980]  Okay, alright, so we do.
[06:22.320 --> 06:22.660]  We do.
[06:22.900 --> 06:23.340]  We do.
[06:23.340 --> 06:24.680]  Do we do, we do.
[06:25.240 --> 06:26.020]  Yes, we do.
[06:26.840 --> 06:28.360]  Phenomenal legwork there, Andrew.
[06:28.520 --> 06:29.420]  Do we do, yes, we do.
[06:30.220 --> 06:31.060]  Does it do.
[06:31.400 --> 06:31.720]  Got it.
[06:31.920 --> 06:32.420]  Okay, cool.
[06:32.620 --> 06:32.940]  Got it.
[06:33.280 --> 06:34.600]  Just trying to figure out...
[06:34.600 --> 06:36.060]  Wall of do, pile of don't.
[06:36.120 --> 06:36.240]  Yeah.
[06:37.080 --> 06:41.740]  This is, it sounds like we're all having the same stroke.
[06:50.120 --> 06:54.140]  If we all do have strokes around the same time, we should film us trying to communicate.
[06:54.360 --> 06:55.460]  It's really something.
[06:55.680 --> 06:56.720]  What the hell is he talking about?
[06:56.740 --> 06:57.820]  This is terrible.
[06:58.500 --> 06:58.840]  Okay.
[06:59.120 --> 07:00.240]  Alright, so that's one.
[07:00.460 --> 07:00.540]  Next one.
[07:00.540 --> 07:01.480]  Let's see what the next one is.
[07:01.580 --> 07:03.880]  Is the Atomic Bee Magic Ear.
[07:09.060 --> 07:10.660]  Oh, like Chinese spy balloons.
[07:11.380 --> 07:13.940]  Do you know who Hunter Ellis is? Is he, like, a known guy?
[07:14.300 --> 07:14.560]  I don't know.
[07:14.560 --> 07:15.300]  I don't think so.
[07:15.620 --> 07:16.540]  Let me look him up.
[07:17.860 --> 07:20.900]  It can hear a pin drop from a hundred feet away.
[07:21.920 --> 07:22.720]  That guy woke up.
[07:24.860 --> 07:26.780]  Do you have a nagging wife?
[07:30.920 --> 07:33.440]  Oh, this dude's fucking got accolades.
[07:33.620 --> 07:35.520]  To be fair, why is she knitting right by the TV?
[07:35.620 --> 07:36.080]  Yeah, right?
[07:36.700 --> 07:37.500]  This is a fair point.
[07:37.840 --> 07:40.480]  You can just spy on people with it.
[07:40.720 --> 07:40.920]  Yep.
[07:42.360 --> 07:43.920]  Oh, she's listening in.
[07:45.960 --> 07:48.140]  It's hard to hear in the backseat of a car.
[07:48.260 --> 07:49.940]  It's hard to hear in the backseat of a car.
[07:49.940 --> 07:51.160]  I can't hear you back here.
[07:51.220 --> 07:52.280]  I can't hear you.
[07:52.540 --> 07:54.020]  And talk comfortably.
[07:54.360 --> 07:55.420]  Can you hear me back there?
[07:56.300 --> 07:57.000]  Loud and clear.
[07:57.380 --> 07:57.760]  Yeah!
[08:01.560 --> 08:02.040]  I'm...
[08:02.040 --> 08:05.340]  ...clearly and comfortably no matter where you're sitting.
[08:05.440 --> 08:05.860]  Okay.
[08:06.100 --> 08:08.880]  Magic Ear gives you the incredible experience of super hearing.
[08:09.200 --> 08:10.280]  Sportsmen and bird watchers...
[08:10.280 --> 08:10.820]  Super hearing.
[08:10.980 --> 08:13.060]  ...to hear noises that are too low for the human ear.
[08:13.060 --> 08:14.560]  Look at all those different birds!
[08:14.560 --> 08:16.280]  Oh, you can track down the swan, Geoff.
[08:16.300 --> 08:17.060]  They're at the mall!
[08:17.180 --> 08:19.100]  He definitely could have seen that.
[08:23.860 --> 08:25.700]  When I'm outside, by your bushes!
[08:29.460 --> 08:30.180]  What a steal.
[08:30.280 --> 08:31.200]  That's a bargain.
[08:31.360 --> 08:32.020]  What a steal.
[08:33.760 --> 08:34.760]  Double the offer?
[08:35.040 --> 08:36.140]  Just pay a separate fee.
[08:36.140 --> 08:37.340]  Double the offer, just pay for it twice.
[08:37.500 --> 08:37.660]  Yeah.
[08:38.600 --> 08:39.660]  Hang on, we're almost there.
[08:43.680 --> 08:46.640]  Magic Ear? It's a deal. Order now.
[08:47.040 --> 08:49.380]  1-800-378-2415
[08:49.380 --> 08:49.780]  Okay.
[08:50.220 --> 08:50.660]  Can...
[08:51.380 --> 08:52.460]  Superba Ear, do we do?
[08:52.540 --> 08:53.840]  Visit getmagicear.com
[08:53.840 --> 08:54.820]  Uh, I think we do.
[08:54.960 --> 08:55.180]  Okay.
[08:55.320 --> 08:55.860]  I think we do.
[08:56.040 --> 08:59.320]  But allow me to blow your fucking dicks off.
[08:59.340 --> 08:59.600]  Okay.
[09:00.200 --> 09:00.640]  Twice.
[09:00.780 --> 09:01.580]  Are we gonna let about Hunter Ellis?
[09:01.580 --> 09:04.520]  Are you about to tell me that Hunter Ellis created Ronald McDonald?
[09:04.660 --> 09:05.100]  Is that what's next?
[09:05.120 --> 09:06.740]  I am about to tell you...
[09:06.740 --> 09:07.740]  Get him, get him!
[09:07.760 --> 09:12.020]  I am about to tell you that Hunter Ellis bisects with us twice.
[09:12.640 --> 09:13.040]  What?
[09:13.620 --> 09:14.780]  He connects to us twice.
[09:15.440 --> 09:16.240]  Hunter Ellis...
[09:16.240 --> 09:16.700]  Yeah, me too.
[09:16.740 --> 09:18.440]  The dude's name was Hunter Ellis, right?
[09:18.540 --> 09:18.800]  Yes.
[09:18.920 --> 09:21.480]  He performed on Survivor in 2002.
[09:21.820 --> 09:22.120]  Okay.
[09:22.480 --> 09:23.440]  So he was on Survivor.
[09:23.540 --> 09:23.740]  Wow.
[09:23.740 --> 09:24.500]  So that's the first connection.
[09:24.600 --> 09:24.700]  Really?
[09:24.980 --> 09:25.200]  Yeah.
[09:25.340 --> 09:30.360]  He was on three episodes of Survivor, so I guess he got voted off pretty early on.
[09:30.840 --> 09:31.180]  And...
[09:31.180 --> 09:31.720]  Couldn't hear anything.
[09:33.880 --> 09:37.360]  He was like a fucking Navy pilot and stuff too, right?
[09:37.360 --> 09:49.520]  But then, from 2011 until he left in 2014 to focus full-time on making documentaries, he was a news anchor for KITV in Austin, Texas.
[09:50.120 --> 09:50.980]  Oh my God.
[09:51.000 --> 09:52.560]  That dude is local.
[09:52.800 --> 09:53.600]  Oh, that's crazy.
[09:53.800 --> 09:54.920]  And he was on Survivor.
[09:55.140 --> 09:55.200]  Holy shit.
[09:55.580 --> 09:58.180]  We get him to come in and help us do.
[09:58.620 --> 09:59.700]  That's fucking wild.
[09:59.840 --> 10:01.960]  We could get him to be on our episode.
[10:02.860 --> 10:04.400]  Hey, does he fucking work or what?
[10:05.880 --> 10:07.680]  He could create the first Does It Do?
[10:07.940 --> 10:12.040]  So, okay.
[10:12.260 --> 10:17.100]  So I like the magic ear, but where does your head go with, like, if we do Does It Do?
[10:18.120 --> 10:19.900]  How do you physically represent that?
[10:19.960 --> 10:20.320]  Yeah, right?
[10:20.400 --> 10:22.220]  It's like whispering from across the room?
[10:22.520 --> 10:23.280]  Like, I don't know what...
[10:23.280 --> 10:26.980]  You could do like a purple monkey dishwasher thing, but I don't know how visually funny that is.
[10:27.500 --> 10:30.820]  I like the idea of secretly hearing someone give you a compliment.
[10:30.820 --> 10:33.880]  Like, how do you then go and talk to them and say, thanks for what you said.
[10:34.360 --> 10:37.060]  I was listening to you from across the room with my magic ear.
[10:37.260 --> 10:38.880]  Like, that's just going to ruin the relationship.
[10:39.080 --> 10:39.820]  So what you...
[10:40.420 --> 10:43.100]  Okay, so you're not thinking of anything to do in the episode.
[10:43.200 --> 10:45.420]  You're just thinking of fun things to do with magic ear.
[10:47.060 --> 10:49.840]  Maybe that's the point of it is you can...
[10:49.840 --> 10:57.360]  We can show how to navigate complicated social situations with the help of miracle ear.
[10:57.760 --> 10:58.340]  Magic ear?
[10:58.400 --> 10:58.900]  Magic ear, sorry.
[10:58.900 --> 11:01.320]  I mean, we can see how far away we can get from each other.
[11:01.920 --> 11:02.640]  That's true.
[11:03.200 --> 11:04.640]  This is sort of a problematic idea.
[11:04.840 --> 11:07.260]  Does it do always have to be in the studio?
[11:07.400 --> 11:09.320]  Could this be some like on-the-field testing?
[11:09.600 --> 11:12.920]  Could you yourself go to a mall, see what you could hear?
[11:13.380 --> 11:14.920]  Maybe other uses for it.
[11:15.740 --> 11:16.140]  Maybe...
[11:16.140 --> 11:18.520]  So your idea is to spy on people at the mall?
[11:19.180 --> 11:22.340]  Yeah, I said it's kind of a problematic idea, but...
[11:22.340 --> 11:22.660]  I like it.
[11:22.760 --> 11:26.700]  What if you went into a movie theater, could listen to the movie from the lobby?
[11:26.700 --> 11:28.720]  You don't even need to buy a ticket to sit in the lobby.
[11:28.800 --> 11:30.180]  You're stealing movies?
[11:32.860 --> 11:33.620]  Convert audio.
[11:33.960 --> 11:36.700]  Maybe you don't want to pay for your ticket of You, Me, and Dupree.
[11:36.800 --> 11:37.900]  You can just get some popularity.
[11:38.960 --> 11:41.560]  What if you want to go to one movie, but you want to hear a different movie?
[11:43.000 --> 11:44.200]  That's another great call.
[11:44.480 --> 11:45.820]  We could split the audio out.
[11:47.120 --> 11:53.880]  Someone's listening to it directly, but we're recording it so we can actually hear what the person who is hearing it is hearing.
[11:53.880 --> 11:56.820]  You would be able to record it and hear it.
[11:56.840 --> 11:59.520]  It may not be a does it do, but I think there's something there.
[11:59.820 --> 12:02.740]  I think we definitely want to do something with it.
[12:02.740 --> 12:06.120]  I feel like that was clearly made before drones existed.
[12:06.460 --> 12:11.980]  How can we implement drones and hear from above for people?
[12:19.450 --> 12:22.310]  But then you'd have a really long cable coming off a drone.
[12:22.310 --> 12:25.450]  That's not the idea.
[12:31.210 --> 12:37.670]  This is a product for people who have too much pride and don't want to wear a hearing aid.
[12:37.850 --> 12:39.050]  That's all this is.
[12:39.410 --> 12:44.130]  But it looks so much worse than a hearing aid.
[12:44.490 --> 12:45.790]  Just wear a hearing aid.
[12:45.850 --> 12:46.890]  And it's $20.
[12:47.610 --> 12:49.050]  How good can it be?
[12:49.290 --> 12:49.890]  Crazy.
[12:51.490 --> 12:53.450]  We're going to need to buy five or six of them.
[12:53.490 --> 12:59.710]  So maybe it doesn't do, but maybe if we have to think of a season and we go, that's the thing, then we come back.
[13:00.410 --> 13:03.830]  Here's what we need to do. We need to create a show called Mall Games.
[13:05.650 --> 13:07.450]  We have to get away from the mall.
[13:09.430 --> 13:13.130]  It's a playground. It's an indoor, climate-controlled playground.
[13:13.630 --> 13:16.730]  We don't have to get jobs, although I still think we should, and I still think it's an idea worth exploring.
[13:17.850 --> 13:24.510]  I think that there are sports and games we can come up with to perform in malls, and this could lead into that at some point.
[13:24.730 --> 13:25.430]  Just an idea.
[13:26.470 --> 13:27.990]  So what's the official ruling?
[13:28.730 --> 13:30.230]  I would say no on this one.
[13:30.750 --> 13:31.090]  Gavin?
[13:31.530 --> 13:32.190]  I would agree.
[13:32.370 --> 13:35.330]  But I think we should get some and explore what we can do with it.
[13:35.450 --> 13:37.610]  So we're not doing it for the show, you just want magic?
[13:37.750 --> 13:40.750]  No, I think it's not for Does It Do, but it might be for some other f***face application.
[13:41.870 --> 13:43.750]  Andrew, what's next?
[13:43.750 --> 13:47.990]  Moving on to the next one, this is, I think, less of the product itself.
[13:48.530 --> 13:50.870]  Once again, the ad brings me joy.
[13:52.050 --> 13:56.970]  This is almost like a mechanism for if we want to do an updated Dodge the B.O.B., potentially.
[13:57.150 --> 14:00.290]  There's a lot of idea around framing with the ad. Here we go.
[14:00.950 --> 14:02.490]  Piggy Pop Baking Mold.
[14:02.710 --> 14:03.030]  Got it.
[14:04.130 --> 14:05.370]  Pop, pop, pop!
[14:06.010 --> 14:06.870]  Piggy Pop!
[14:07.530 --> 14:08.930]  Look at that mustard.
[14:11.630 --> 14:12.850]  She's wearing a mustard shirt.
[14:23.070 --> 14:24.490]  Twelve in minutes!
[14:25.370 --> 14:26.730]  Look at how good they look!
[14:29.990 --> 14:32.090]  Why are their heads all like, snapped up?
[14:32.350 --> 14:33.310]  They look f***ed up.
[14:33.430 --> 14:34.770]  This looks so unappetizing.
[14:34.790 --> 14:36.070]  It's like a bunch of pig ears.
[14:37.130 --> 14:38.230]  Treachum and mustard.
[14:38.470 --> 14:40.170]  No, don't do that!
[14:40.990 --> 14:42.390]  Who wants this?
[14:43.350 --> 14:44.230]  Just pour and fill.
[14:45.530 --> 14:48.410]  Has anyone ever plopped the sausage clean out of the pastry?
[14:49.150 --> 14:49.670]  No.
[14:49.830 --> 14:51.170]  From the pan? I've never seen that.
[14:52.730 --> 14:54.450]  You pancake pigs!
[14:58.030 --> 15:00.370]  For the big game. I love the big game.
[15:00.730 --> 15:02.130]  I love the big game.
[15:02.710 --> 15:03.530]  Pizza pigs!
[15:03.830 --> 15:04.370]  Pop, pop, pop!
[15:05.990 --> 15:07.270]  Dessert pigs!
[15:08.270 --> 15:10.270]  Oh, they're really going for it.
[15:10.430 --> 15:12.190]  Do whatever you want with these!
[15:12.230 --> 15:12.870]  Cake pigs!
[15:13.810 --> 15:14.730]  Anniversary pigs!
[15:14.890 --> 15:15.270]  Holidays!
[15:15.710 --> 15:16.110]  Weddings!
[15:16.470 --> 15:17.230]  Boating pigs!
[15:18.370 --> 15:19.930]  We've got to do the pig gauntlet.
[15:22.590 --> 15:26.190]  We should make the perfect five course pig meal.
[15:29.710 --> 15:33.270]  And then we do pig ice cubes as well for drinks.
[15:36.590 --> 15:37.950]  The perfect pig!
[15:40.550 --> 15:42.030]  Stop showing me the mustard!
[15:42.070 --> 15:43.290]  They're really into mustard.
[15:43.610 --> 15:45.010]  Stop! Stop!
[15:45.690 --> 15:46.510]  It's too much mustard.
[15:48.890 --> 15:50.650]  20 bucks is as much as a magic ear.
[15:50.830 --> 15:53.690]  We could do a 100% cocoa chocolate pig.
[15:54.030 --> 15:56.990]  We could do the different percentages of different pigs.
[15:59.690 --> 16:00.650]  That's good.
[16:00.790 --> 16:01.910]  We could do a bav pig.
[16:01.910 --> 16:05.910]  I like that there's 12 in the tray, right?
[16:06.070 --> 16:08.230]  So you could actually make the full meal in one tray.
[16:08.350 --> 16:09.230]  Oh, I think you'd have to.
[16:10.130 --> 16:10.970]  Like the perfect tray.
[16:11.170 --> 16:13.270]  So, do you feel like that's an episode?
[16:14.070 --> 16:14.730]  You know what I mean?
[16:14.850 --> 16:20.110]  I like the idea of so many pigs and saying the word pig so many times is fun to me.
[16:21.950 --> 16:24.710]  I'll answer your question with a question.
[16:25.010 --> 16:25.390]  Great.
[16:26.030 --> 16:28.650]  Was the frozen popsicle episode an episode?
[16:31.250 --> 16:35.910]  I feel like there's more to do with the pig than there was to do with that.
[16:36.050 --> 16:37.630]  Okay, okay, okay.
[16:38.030 --> 16:44.270]  Now, I will say that the popsicle thing was a thin premise.
[16:44.910 --> 16:48.230]  And I don't know that this is much thicker, but there is more to it.
[16:48.870 --> 16:51.830]  My thing with this is that it's going to take a while.
[16:52.010 --> 16:53.810]  We're going to have to do a lot of pre-prep.
[16:54.290 --> 16:55.650]  That'd be the night before situation.
[16:56.070 --> 16:57.150]  There's no oven here, right?
[16:58.150 --> 16:59.950]  Which is like less fun.
[17:00.110 --> 17:00.830]  We'll have to buy an oven.
[17:01.470 --> 17:02.370]  We'll have to buy an oven.
[17:02.990 --> 17:05.450]  Which to me is less fun than doing it on the day.
[17:05.630 --> 17:08.730]  Maybe that's a product for Commercial's Kitchen, our spinoff show.
[17:09.310 --> 17:09.970]  Is that a spinoff show?
[17:10.170 --> 17:12.150]  Yeah. Commercial's Kitchen, I've told you about it.
[17:12.350 --> 17:14.370]  Where we do Does It Do, but just with kitchen stuff.
[17:14.750 --> 17:17.990]  And you call it Commercial's Kitchen instead of Commercial Kitchen. It's very clever.
[17:18.410 --> 17:20.610]  And we just do stuff from commercials in a kitchen.
[17:21.230 --> 17:25.490]  Because there's way more kitchen shit than non-kitchen shit.
[17:25.490 --> 17:30.350]  I didn't realize that Does It Do not only has a prequel, but also has a sideshow.
[17:31.250 --> 17:34.190]  It's had a spinoff since the pitch deck, when I pitched it to everybody.
[17:34.950 --> 17:36.810]  Commercial's Kitchen was in the pitch deck.
[17:37.470 --> 17:39.750]  Since day one. I came up with the ideas in tandem.
[17:40.530 --> 17:40.690]  Yeah?
[17:41.510 --> 17:45.050]  Because we're going to run out of Does It Do products faster than Commercial Kitchen products.
[17:45.230 --> 17:47.490]  I love the idea of having something inside the pig.
[17:50.590 --> 17:54.410]  There's so many options for basically making the little skeletons of the pigs.
[17:54.710 --> 17:56.150]  With everything else around it, with the flesh.
[17:56.310 --> 18:00.990]  I'm thinking about a pig roulette, where we make who knows what's inside the pig.
[18:01.190 --> 18:02.890]  And then you gotta spin a wheel and eat the pig.
[18:04.510 --> 18:08.150]  But then I don't know what you're trying to accomplish, other than I'm making you eat a weird pig.
[18:09.130 --> 18:13.330]  It is interesting. I wonder if we could find hard candy skeleton bones.
[18:13.330 --> 18:17.230]  And then we could literally put a candy skeleton inside.
[18:17.850 --> 18:18.110]  Yeah.
[18:18.950 --> 18:19.830]  That's morbid.
[18:20.910 --> 18:23.630]  That would be the Halloween special of Commercial's Kitchen.
[18:24.470 --> 18:29.810]  So, no it don't, but Commercial's Kitchen.
[18:30.870 --> 18:33.550]  We still need to talk about when Commercial's Kitchen is going to come out.
[18:33.710 --> 18:35.610]  Some of us have only just heard about it.
[18:35.710 --> 18:36.550]  It was in the pitch deck.
[18:37.690 --> 18:38.630]  I didn't see a deck.
[18:42.040 --> 18:43.180]  She sent me a deck?
[18:43.180 --> 18:45.620]  You were sent a deck over a year ago.
[18:45.660 --> 18:46.480]  Geoff's in a bad mood.
[18:47.740 --> 18:51.540]  I promise you, on Slack or... don't even start with me.
[18:52.900 --> 18:55.580]  Commercial's Kitchen has been pitched as long as Does It Do has been pitched.
[18:55.700 --> 18:57.180]  I can't be bothered.
[18:57.840 --> 18:59.460]  Geoff is starting to think about getting mad.
[19:00.640 --> 19:03.620]  I like it. I think we should do something with it.
[19:03.700 --> 19:05.240]  Okay. I think there's something to it.
[19:05.240 --> 19:07.280]  Whether it's Does It Do or Commercial's Kitchen, I don't care.
[19:07.520 --> 19:11.160]  It's so absurd that we should do something with it.
[19:11.160 --> 19:18.340]  I agree that it seems like a very thin premise, but given the success of that Popsicle thing, I think we could get away with just about anything.
[19:18.840 --> 19:20.480]  Okay. So we're three for three so far.
[19:20.500 --> 19:22.840]  Yeah, I think you found some good stuff so far, bud.
[19:22.940 --> 19:24.520]  Okay, so here we go. This is four.
[19:24.880 --> 19:29.540]  I feel like this would actually be a good Does It Do, but the ad itself isn't necessarily super fun.
[19:29.560 --> 19:32.100]  Before you hit play, how many of these are there? Do you have...
[19:32.100 --> 19:36.240]  I have ten loaded up. I have three I cutted right before we did this.
[19:36.800 --> 19:37.920]  Okay. Cutted?
[19:38.120 --> 19:39.000]  Here we go. Don't worry about it.
[19:40.380 --> 19:41.720]  What? What did I say?
[19:42.380 --> 19:43.620]  What did I say? Edited?
[19:44.180 --> 19:45.100]  You said cutted.
[19:45.800 --> 19:46.940]  I said cutted?
[19:47.080 --> 19:48.520]  Yeah, dude. You said it pretty clearly.
[19:48.640 --> 19:49.740]  I said cutted?
[19:49.820 --> 19:51.920]  He said, I have three that I cutted right before we started.
[19:52.160 --> 19:55.980]  I said adapt when I meant to say adopt earlier and it's still haunting me.
[19:56.740 --> 20:00.400]  Now I need to think about cutted when in my head I said edited.
[20:00.560 --> 20:02.060]  Your mind is disintegrating.
[20:02.680 --> 20:08.080]  Listen, I'm still on the rocks from the soda chug four hours ago or whatever that was.
[20:08.080 --> 20:09.520]  But here we go. Next product.
[20:11.080 --> 20:14.560]  Industry leading electric shaker, but it does like a little tornado.
[20:14.860 --> 20:15.600]  It's like that bullshit.
[20:15.800 --> 20:20.360]  See how it makes a little tornado in it? It mixes your drink for you.
[20:20.760 --> 20:21.480]  Oh, yeah.
[20:22.200 --> 20:25.120]  They're thinking protein powder. I'm thinking it's shatter resistant.
[20:27.440 --> 20:28.360]  LED lights.
[20:28.640 --> 20:29.220]  Bunch of other things.
[20:31.080 --> 20:31.880]  I like this.
[20:31.880 --> 20:34.220]  Look at how cool this mug cup thing is.
[20:34.300 --> 20:35.760]  I actually have like six of these.
[20:36.100 --> 20:36.620]  Do you really?
[20:36.620 --> 20:37.140]  Yeah.
[20:37.220 --> 20:37.660]  Really?
[20:38.020 --> 20:39.580]  It's like filmed vortexes inside them.
[20:40.240 --> 20:41.140]  They work pretty good.
[20:41.440 --> 20:41.740]  Yeah.
[20:44.950 --> 20:46.230]  This to me has...
[20:46.230 --> 20:46.270]  Look at that.
[20:46.310 --> 20:48.150]  There's so many possibilities here.
[20:48.730 --> 20:49.070]  Yes.
[20:49.490 --> 20:49.930]  Like...
[20:49.930 --> 20:50.830]  I want to mix cement.
[20:51.370 --> 20:52.130]  That's great.
[20:52.210 --> 20:52.890]  That's a great idea.
[20:53.030 --> 20:54.590]  To me, it's soup.
[20:55.170 --> 20:56.170]  And then like...
[20:56.170 --> 20:58.250]  I want to see it mix soup.
[20:58.470 --> 20:59.890]  I want to see like...
[20:59.890 --> 21:04.030]  I want to see you like layer stuff in it and see if it'll like totally mix it up.
[21:04.670 --> 21:05.870]  What about like cereal?
[21:06.470 --> 21:07.210]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:07.210 --> 21:08.610]  I want to see that stuff.
[21:08.690 --> 21:08.850]  Oh!
[21:09.370 --> 21:11.550]  Cereal and milk and seeing if it will make it...
[21:11.550 --> 21:12.210]  Yeah.
[21:12.430 --> 21:12.890]  All together?
[21:13.010 --> 21:13.930]  Does it good blend for you?
[21:14.010 --> 21:14.210]  Yeah.
[21:15.090 --> 21:15.490]  Yeah.
[21:15.630 --> 21:17.330]  What else needs to be really well coated?
[21:17.990 --> 21:18.390]  Paint?
[21:18.870 --> 21:19.530]  You know what you could do?
[21:19.610 --> 21:21.790]  You could mix a salad up in there pretty well.
[21:22.230 --> 21:23.290]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[21:23.290 --> 21:23.910]  Oh, I hadn't thought about that.
[21:23.970 --> 21:25.650]  Doing like a salad dressing all on it.
[21:25.850 --> 21:26.210]  Yeah.
[21:26.630 --> 21:27.370]  It's really good.
[21:27.570 --> 21:27.790]  Yeah.
[21:28.090 --> 21:28.390]  Like...
[21:28.390 --> 21:30.130]  Because drizzling only does so much work.
[21:30.270 --> 21:31.570]  But if you have everything in there...
[21:31.570 --> 21:33.290]  And then you go into the bowl...
[21:34.090 --> 21:34.410]  Perfect.
[21:34.830 --> 21:35.730]  Yeah, there's a lot you could do.
[21:35.730 --> 21:36.990]  I really like...
[21:36.990 --> 21:38.290]  The cement is a totally different...
[21:38.290 --> 21:40.750]  I hadn't thought about mixing items.
[21:41.770 --> 21:42.650]  Industrial cement.
[21:42.870 --> 21:43.050]  Yeah.
[21:43.190 --> 21:43.770]  Yeah, it's good.
[21:44.050 --> 21:47.190]  If you do like a quickcrete in that...
[21:47.190 --> 21:48.730]  Or like a shockcrete, like something fast...
[21:49.430 --> 21:50.750]  It would absolutely...
[21:50.750 --> 21:51.490]  It would just...
[21:51.490 --> 21:52.730]  It would make it so quickly.
[21:53.110 --> 21:54.990]  And then you could pour it into your pig balls.
[21:55.350 --> 21:56.770]  And make little cement balls.
[21:59.470 --> 22:01.910]  Someone's front wall is full of these little cement balls.
[22:02.850 --> 22:04.950]  We could build a piggy wall.
[22:04.950 --> 22:05.570]  That's great.
[22:07.750 --> 22:10.150]  I'm immediately thinking like that two-part epoxy.
[22:10.490 --> 22:12.450]  Yes, that's exactly what I thought too.
[22:12.590 --> 22:12.990]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:13.290 --> 22:15.890]  Oh, I want to see...
[22:15.890 --> 22:18.630]  James Bond always says shaken, not stirred.
[22:18.790 --> 22:20.270]  And I really want to see...
[22:20.270 --> 22:20.910]  Oh, martini?
[22:21.010 --> 22:22.990]  Yeah, I want to see if this makes a great martini.
[22:23.250 --> 22:24.510]  Does it work with the lid off?
[22:25.170 --> 22:26.330]  They showed it with the lid off.
[22:26.450 --> 22:27.130]  Yeah, yeah, it works with the lid off.
[22:27.130 --> 22:30.630]  So we could put like four of them in a bathtub and create a whirlpool?
[22:31.290 --> 22:32.590]  I don't think that's what would happen.
[22:32.710 --> 22:33.610]  But yes, we could.
[22:33.790 --> 22:34.330]  We could try.
[22:34.330 --> 22:35.030]  Absolutely.
[22:35.190 --> 22:37.810]  As long as we use plastic and not glass, 100%.
[22:37.810 --> 22:40.790]  Now I'm thinking we do a vodka martini in that.
[22:40.890 --> 22:41.070]  Yeah.
[22:41.190 --> 22:43.970]  And then we also buy one of those paint tin shakers.
[22:44.150 --> 22:44.270]  Yeah.
[22:44.350 --> 22:45.410]  Make a vodka martini in that.
[22:45.530 --> 22:46.470]  See what's better, shaken...
[22:46.470 --> 22:46.970]  It's pretty good.
[22:47.470 --> 22:48.810]  Extremely shaken or extremely stirred.
[22:48.810 --> 22:49.910]  We could also mix paint.
[22:49.950 --> 22:50.630]  You can mix paint.
[22:50.650 --> 22:50.830]  Yeah.
[22:50.890 --> 22:51.510]  We can mix paint.
[22:51.530 --> 22:52.250]  You start mixing colors.
[22:52.590 --> 22:54.310]  Like, you want to make the best green.
[22:54.450 --> 22:55.890]  You put blue and yellow together.
[22:55.950 --> 22:56.110]  Yeah.
[22:56.150 --> 22:56.850]  And then let the bulb...
[22:56.850 --> 22:57.430]  You know what we could do?
[22:57.470 --> 22:58.330]  Oh, green and purple.
[22:58.450 --> 22:59.070]  We could make a gherpal.
[22:59.230 --> 23:00.290]  We could make a gherpal.
[23:00.370 --> 23:01.450]  You could make a gherpal.
[23:02.050 --> 23:02.670]  That's great.
[23:03.190 --> 23:05.190]  We need 12 of these.
[23:05.890 --> 23:06.970]  So, do we do?
[23:06.970 --> 23:07.670]  Yes, do we do.
[23:07.750 --> 23:08.250]  We do.
[23:08.490 --> 23:08.830]  100%.
[23:08.830 --> 23:10.050]  And I wonder if we could...
[23:10.050 --> 23:10.730]  No, that's budget.
[23:11.430 --> 23:13.630]  I'm just saying, like, we get Marcus to make a massive one.
[23:13.970 --> 23:15.410]  I bet we could make a big one of these.
[23:16.310 --> 23:16.810]  Could we?
[23:17.810 --> 23:18.710]  Isn't that just a blender?
[23:21.030 --> 23:22.310]  No, because it won't chop.
[23:22.370 --> 23:22.990]  It just mixes.
[23:23.570 --> 23:23.810]  Okay.
[23:24.710 --> 23:25.830]  Okay, so we will do.
[23:25.950 --> 23:26.670]  Yeah, we do.
[23:26.830 --> 23:26.950]  We do.
[23:27.070 --> 23:27.310]  We do.
[23:28.030 --> 23:28.650]  It's exciting.
[23:29.090 --> 23:30.170]  The next one, I don't...
[23:30.170 --> 23:33.570]  I'm going to just pitch after I submit it.
[23:33.730 --> 23:37.210]  I don't think it's a great one necessarily, but I have an idea for it that makes me happy.
[23:38.210 --> 23:39.070]  Topic commercial.
[23:40.890 --> 23:42.050]  His hair is thinning.
[23:42.490 --> 23:43.470]  That guy looks like Baker Mayfield.
[23:43.790 --> 23:44.210]  He does.
[23:44.450 --> 23:46.110]  He does look like Baker Mayfield.
[23:48.270 --> 23:49.890]  Real un-retouched photos.
[23:51.690 --> 23:52.130]  Topic.
[23:53.010 --> 23:53.770]  Are you going bald?
[23:54.490 --> 23:55.470]  Throw this powder on your head.
[23:55.490 --> 23:56.290]  Is this the stuff?
[23:56.610 --> 23:56.810]  Yeah.
[23:56.930 --> 23:58.110]  Oh, it just dyes your head?
[23:58.230 --> 23:58.750]  No, no.
[23:58.750 --> 24:00.790]  It has like little fibers that hang out.
[24:00.790 --> 24:01.730]  Oh my god.
[24:02.130 --> 24:06.010]  They used to spray this on Artie Lang on the Howard Stern Show all the time to cover his bald spot.
[24:06.270 --> 24:06.990]  That's what this is.
[24:07.130 --> 24:07.270]  Yeah.
[24:08.090 --> 24:10.370]  So it's just flecks of hair?
[24:10.830 --> 24:12.090]  It's not hair.
[24:12.290 --> 24:17.490]  It's like fiber stuff that just like essentially just fills stuff in.
[24:17.730 --> 24:18.610]  Yeah, it's like a fill in.
[24:19.190 --> 24:19.570]  Where does it go?
[24:19.570 --> 24:20.310]  Does it end up in the drain?
[24:20.430 --> 24:21.410]  Does it just wash out of your head?
[24:21.550 --> 24:23.190]  Yeah, it just washes out like paint or something.
[24:23.770 --> 24:24.550]  Oh my god.
[24:24.550 --> 24:27.630]  Instant results, risk-free. Try Topic now.
[24:27.950 --> 24:28.790]  I mean, I would...
[24:28.790 --> 24:31.950]  I want to put that on a completely bald person.
[24:32.390 --> 24:33.650]  Yes, like I was thinking like...
[24:33.650 --> 24:34.250]  Let's get Geoff Yetter.
[24:34.490 --> 24:35.930]  That's such a good idea.
[24:36.010 --> 24:36.490]  Let's get Geoff Yetter.
[24:36.770 --> 24:37.070]  Absolutely.
[24:37.270 --> 24:38.230]  I would 100% do that.
[24:38.450 --> 24:38.590]  Yeah.
[24:38.870 --> 24:39.750]  And I would do it too.
[24:39.850 --> 24:41.830]  Let's see how much hair we can give him.
[24:41.850 --> 24:41.890]  Okay.
[24:42.830 --> 24:43.870]  Just like put like...
[24:43.870 --> 24:44.790]  On your face?
[24:44.910 --> 24:46.330]  I want to do...
[24:46.330 --> 24:48.850]  I want to see what I look like with a beard.
[24:49.250 --> 24:49.610]  Yeah.
[24:49.610 --> 24:49.890]  Yeah.
[24:49.990 --> 24:51.130]  I have a mustache.
[24:51.670 --> 24:52.610]  I want to see what I look like.
[24:52.650 --> 24:53.410]  I've never had a beard.
[24:53.410 --> 24:53.930]  I've never had a beard.
[24:53.990 --> 24:55.110]  I can't grow a beard.
[24:55.250 --> 24:55.550]  Why?
[24:56.070 --> 24:56.970]  It doesn't grow.
[24:57.150 --> 24:57.370]  What?
[24:58.810 --> 24:59.250]  Why?
[24:59.430 --> 25:01.010]  Why can't you grow a beard?
[25:01.750 --> 25:06.810]  It's like my dad said, if you fucking grow a beard, it doesn't grow.
[25:07.030 --> 25:07.870]  It doesn't...
[25:07.870 --> 25:08.250]  I can't.
[25:08.290 --> 25:09.610]  There's nothing here.
[25:10.030 --> 25:10.690]  That's crazy.
[25:10.910 --> 25:11.390]  I'd love that.
[25:11.510 --> 25:11.950]  We'll fill in.
[25:12.490 --> 25:14.230]  I would love to have facial hair at all.
[25:14.370 --> 25:17.710]  You'd love to be able to not grow a beard, but you have a beard.
[25:17.710 --> 25:19.990]  You have one only because it keeps growing.
[25:25.010 --> 25:27.630]  So you don't have it because you want it, you have it because you gave up.
[25:27.770 --> 25:27.870]  Yeah.
[25:28.690 --> 25:28.930]  Okay.
[25:29.190 --> 25:34.730]  The real reason I have it is that my trimmer has a UK plug on it that I lost, and I can't charge the damn thing.
[25:34.750 --> 25:42.910]  Now, do you think if we apply topic to your already full beard, it will look just so fucking big?
[25:43.090 --> 25:43.270]  Yeah.
[25:43.450 --> 25:46.090]  You could join the Austin Beard Club or whatever.
[25:46.210 --> 25:46.650]  Yeah.
[25:47.110 --> 25:47.550]  Okay.
[25:48.310 --> 25:50.690]  So I really like that.
[25:50.690 --> 25:54.490]  I really like the idea of putting on a totally bald person, giving me a beard.
[25:54.930 --> 26:00.090]  Like, what are the other things that are a little out of the realm of just putting it on people?
[26:00.250 --> 26:01.150]  You know, confetti cannons.
[26:01.890 --> 26:02.170]  Yeah.
[26:02.330 --> 26:03.910]  Can you blast a beard onto someone?
[26:04.030 --> 26:08.390]  Can you blast hair onto someone's head?
[26:08.410 --> 26:09.190]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:09.510 --> 26:10.190]  That's a good question.
[26:10.310 --> 26:11.030]  That's great.
[26:11.130 --> 26:12.630]  How would you do that?
[26:12.690 --> 26:13.590]  Oh, maybe chest hair.
[26:13.870 --> 26:14.750]  You just fire it.
[26:14.810 --> 26:15.590]  Never had chest hair.
[26:15.770 --> 26:17.490]  Yeah, we'll blast it on with a confetti cannon.
[26:17.490 --> 26:21.210]  Well, what if you, like, put it in a leaf blower and then turned it on?
[26:21.430 --> 26:22.970]  Like, just fill it a leaf blower.
[26:23.310 --> 26:24.890]  You know, like, actually, like, shotgun.
[26:25.250 --> 26:26.830]  Can you give somebody's front yard hair?
[26:29.050 --> 26:34.110]  You could put it in a hairdryer and then turn the hairdryer on.
[26:34.790 --> 26:35.370]  And it would go.
[26:35.750 --> 26:36.090]  It would go.
[26:36.510 --> 26:37.510]  I bet this stuff's flammable.
[26:37.510 --> 26:38.230]  This is great.
[26:38.410 --> 26:39.610]  We should definitely see if we can set it on fire.
[26:39.610 --> 26:40.870]  Okay, so what else...
[26:40.870 --> 26:42.210]  So we need, like, half a ton of this stuff.
[26:42.210 --> 26:43.710]  You put it with, like...
[26:43.710 --> 26:43.910]  We have that.
[26:45.190 --> 26:47.390]  Making fuller plants?
[26:47.590 --> 26:48.390]  Do you put it on, like...
[26:48.390 --> 26:49.250]  What else can you...
[26:49.250 --> 26:50.190]  There's gotta be...
[26:50.190 --> 26:53.110]  I mean, what we just already covered is more than 12 minutes.
[26:53.230 --> 26:53.430]  Okay.
[26:53.630 --> 26:54.750]  Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[26:55.010 --> 26:55.970]  But we'll come up with more stuff on the day.
[26:55.970 --> 26:56.490]  I don't want to overthink it.
[26:56.570 --> 26:57.390]  We'll come up with more stuff.
[26:57.450 --> 26:58.490]  I think there's a lot we can do.
[26:58.510 --> 26:59.330]  I really like it.
[26:59.530 --> 26:59.850]  Same.
[27:02.210 --> 27:03.270]  So, do we do?
[27:03.810 --> 27:04.130]  Yes.
[27:04.290 --> 27:04.390]  We do.
[27:04.470 --> 27:04.690]  Okay.
[27:04.730 --> 27:04.910]  Yeah.
[27:05.390 --> 27:05.650]  Okay.
[27:05.870 --> 27:06.130]  Okay.
[27:06.290 --> 27:06.870]  I think that's a...
[27:07.390 --> 27:08.990]  I like the way you presented it, Andrew.
[27:09.070 --> 27:10.670]  Also, life lesson for people that are listening.
[27:11.430 --> 27:13.250]  We were talking about why we have beards when we don't.
[27:13.250 --> 27:14.470]  Gavin has his because he's lazy.
[27:15.070 --> 27:18.650]  If you're considering not having a beard when you have a beard,
[27:18.850 --> 27:22.250]  don't start dating a woman who only knows you with a beard.
[27:22.410 --> 27:22.690]  Oh, yeah.
[27:22.790 --> 27:24.330]  Because then you're stuck with that beard for the rest of your life.
[27:24.370 --> 27:25.050]  That's why I have a beard.
[27:25.170 --> 27:26.910]  Because I went on a date with Emily.
[27:27.030 --> 27:27.890]  Our first date, I had a beard.
[27:28.090 --> 27:29.430]  And so now I have to have a beard for the rest of my life.
[27:29.490 --> 27:32.750]  So you're saying, life hack, shave before the first date.
[27:32.870 --> 27:35.770]  If you don't want to be tied to a beard for the rest of your life, yeah.
[27:35.910 --> 27:36.170]  Okay.
[27:36.610 --> 27:38.370]  Has she seen you in person without a beard?
[27:38.490 --> 27:39.690]  Yeah, I've shaved it before a few times.
[27:39.750 --> 27:40.330]  She's like, hmm...
[27:42.650 --> 27:43.050]  Awesome.
[27:43.830 --> 27:45.630]  I think Jack's in the same situation.
[27:45.730 --> 27:46.510]  He could never shave it.
[27:46.590 --> 27:46.910]  Oh, definitely.
[27:47.290 --> 27:47.470]  Okay.
[27:47.890 --> 27:50.090]  So we will do, I like it, on the list.
[27:50.190 --> 27:50.970]  What do you got next?
[27:51.350 --> 27:52.570]  I'm so excited about this one.
[27:52.670 --> 27:54.650]  This one may have solved Geoff's problem.
[27:54.750 --> 27:57.510]  And I think there's all sorts of variations we can attempt to try with it.
[27:57.730 --> 27:59.270]  This is the sock slider.
[28:03.810 --> 28:06.190]  Well, she sat on an egg sitter for a start.
[28:07.390 --> 28:08.190]  Oh, man.
[28:08.490 --> 28:09.590]  There's no way he's getting to that sock.
[28:10.530 --> 28:11.570]  Not anymore.
[28:11.990 --> 28:12.770]  Sock slider.
[28:15.610 --> 28:17.270]  You have to bend down.
[28:17.530 --> 28:17.590]  Okay.
[28:20.250 --> 28:21.390]  Slide your foot in.
[28:23.510 --> 28:25.890]  This is, there's so much we can do with this.
[28:26.790 --> 28:27.310]  Yeah.
[28:27.850 --> 28:30.630]  I don't like these foot-based episodes that we keep coming up with.
[28:30.790 --> 28:34.450]  I think you need to turn on the flexion by Gavin.
[28:34.810 --> 28:35.970]  That's too much.
[28:36.550 --> 28:38.230]  Gavin's libido can't take it.
[28:40.610 --> 28:41.250]  Multiple surgery.
[28:42.510 --> 28:43.590]  Gavin's texting Meg right now.
[28:43.650 --> 28:44.690]  He's like, I'm going to be home in an hour.
[28:44.850 --> 28:45.750]  Have your shoes off.
[28:47.290 --> 28:48.370]  When I walk in the door.
[28:49.450 --> 28:50.430]  Get the sock slider.
[28:52.070 --> 28:52.470]  Oh, good.
[28:52.510 --> 28:53.330]  You can travel with it.
[28:53.830 --> 28:55.170]  It's only four pieces.
[28:55.190 --> 28:57.850]  You get a little stick for it for helping put your shoes on.
[28:58.590 --> 29:01.690]  If you're wearing those shoes, you don't got to wear a big sock with it.
[29:01.750 --> 29:02.090]  What are you doing?
[29:02.210 --> 29:03.250]  I'm going to need a big sock slider.
[29:03.710 --> 29:04.030]  Yes.
[29:04.130 --> 29:04.330]  Okay.
[29:04.550 --> 29:05.530]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[29:05.570 --> 29:07.630]  But there's going to be so much foot shit.
[29:08.030 --> 29:08.970]  No, it doesn't have to be foot.
[29:10.210 --> 29:12.670]  What if you take all your bread out of a bread bag?
[29:12.750 --> 29:13.650]  How are you going to get it back in?
[29:14.170 --> 29:16.690]  Or load up a balaclava on it.
[29:16.930 --> 29:17.930]  Dive head first.
[29:20.990 --> 29:22.470]  Does it work for condoms?
[29:23.010 --> 29:24.350]  That's exactly what I was thinking.
[29:27.170 --> 29:30.170]  The idea of making food with it is very funny.
[29:30.650 --> 29:31.690]  Oh, like sausage it.
[29:33.390 --> 29:35.410]  A burrito, like a pita pocket.
[29:36.090 --> 29:41.990]  Do it like a sausage where you're trying to cram chorizo or whatever.
[29:42.210 --> 29:44.950]  And then you just shoehorn it into your own face at the end.
[29:45.790 --> 29:46.930]  I do think there's something there.
[29:47.270 --> 29:47.450]  Absolutely.
[29:47.790 --> 29:50.610]  Cake icing, trying to get into the cake icing thing.
[29:50.690 --> 29:54.030]  With socks, can you do a double footed jump and just land in a pair of socks?
[29:54.030 --> 29:54.690]  There you go.
[29:56.370 --> 29:57.630]  We can do cool tricks.
[29:58.190 --> 29:59.350]  Oh, like 360 socks?
[29:59.570 --> 30:00.530]  360 socks, yeah.
[30:02.750 --> 30:03.470]  That's enough.
[30:05.130 --> 30:05.810]  Okay, so...
[30:05.810 --> 30:08.630]  I saw the wheels spinning, but they weren't going anywhere on you.
[30:10.150 --> 30:11.470]  Okay, so do we do?
[30:12.470 --> 30:12.810]  Yes.
[30:13.590 --> 30:13.890]  Okay.
[30:13.950 --> 30:14.590]  I think so.
[30:14.730 --> 30:15.590]  I think that's a great one.
[30:15.710 --> 30:16.190]  I do too, yeah.
[30:16.290 --> 30:20.990]  I think it has so many weird applications, and Gavin's going to have a fucking great time.
[30:21.050 --> 30:22.650]  Anything we can find that's not food related.
[30:22.750 --> 30:26.090]  Yeah, and I think with feet and everything, he's so fucking on board.
[30:26.110 --> 30:26.950]  Plus, it's right up his alley.
[30:27.010 --> 30:27.750]  Yeah, really, no kidding.
[30:28.410 --> 30:29.970]  Alright, Andrew, what's...
[30:29.970 --> 30:30.610]  Next one.
[30:30.650 --> 30:31.350]  He's not even saying anything.
[30:31.350 --> 30:32.790]  My favorite commercial.
[30:32.790 --> 30:33.810]  I think.
[30:34.210 --> 30:34.770]  Of all of these.
[30:34.890 --> 30:38.710]  But once again, I don't know how it would be necessarily used, but it's just so good.
[30:38.830 --> 30:39.370]  Is this a toilet?
[30:39.670 --> 30:40.190]  Boom tunes!
[30:40.430 --> 30:40.530]  Okay.
[30:43.050 --> 30:43.530]  Boom!
[30:45.110 --> 30:46.130]  What the fuck?
[30:46.130 --> 30:47.250]  Oh, it turns everything into a volume.
[30:47.250 --> 30:48.570]  It turns everything into a speaker!
[30:48.790 --> 30:49.530]  Oh, absolutely.
[30:50.690 --> 30:51.170]  Bam!
[30:52.790 --> 30:54.190]  That box is now a speaker.
[30:54.650 --> 30:56.490]  That car, now a speaker.
[30:57.770 --> 30:58.090]  Boom!
[30:58.090 --> 31:02.450]  Have you ever wanted to hear your music sound like the fucking worst shit you've ever heard?
[31:02.450 --> 31:03.580]  Then put it on your shoe.
[31:07.530 --> 31:09.690]  Oh, you can have such a cool drink.
[31:10.290 --> 31:12.050]  Everybody gather around my drink.
[31:12.330 --> 31:15.310]  We should play the Jurassic Park stomp through it.
[31:17.130 --> 31:18.790]  This wouldn't hook up to any of our phones.
[31:18.970 --> 31:19.030]  No.
[31:21.030 --> 31:22.610]  There's a phone right there!
[31:24.050 --> 31:25.470]  Yeah, but this is louder, Gavin.
[31:25.530 --> 31:25.730]  Okay.
[31:28.510 --> 31:29.430]  So annoying.
[31:29.810 --> 31:29.970]  Yeah!
[31:30.610 --> 31:31.430]  Listen to the mailbox!
[31:31.430 --> 31:33.650]  The only thing we can make our mailbox a speaker.
[31:34.650 --> 31:36.310]  Turn down your dresser!
[31:38.950 --> 31:41.250]  Oh, you can make toast while you're... oh, that's so cool.
[31:42.930 --> 31:43.330]  Boom!
[31:43.850 --> 31:44.950]  Andrew loves this commercial.
[31:49.230 --> 31:50.770]  I think a toilet seat would do well.
[31:50.910 --> 31:51.410]  Oh, yeah.
[31:53.030 --> 31:54.070]  I wonder if it works underwater.
[31:54.390 --> 31:55.530]  I wonder if it works on a person.
[31:55.690 --> 31:57.750]  Can we put it on something really quiet, like a librarian?
[32:03.450 --> 32:05.390]  That is the funniest thing you've ever said.
[32:08.470 --> 32:11.350]  They are really showing you what you can attach this to.
[32:11.470 --> 32:13.630]  I wonder if we can turn my butthole into a speaker.
[32:15.390 --> 32:16.270]  We should...
[32:16.270 --> 32:19.050]  Like, right on the anus.
[32:19.990 --> 32:21.990]  We should attach it to a speaker.
[32:22.390 --> 32:22.610]  Yeah.
[32:22.890 --> 32:24.930]  See if we don't need power.
[32:25.230 --> 32:26.270]  See if it sounds good that way.
[32:28.110 --> 32:30.830]  I think there's stuff there.
[32:30.830 --> 32:33.230]  I do think it's the same trick over and over.
[32:33.630 --> 32:33.950]  Yes.
[32:35.210 --> 32:41.370]  But I think it's visually so funny to stick something to something and have sound come out of it.
[32:41.430 --> 32:41.990]  Plus, if we...
[32:42.450 --> 32:46.550]  Could we daisy chain it where we have like eight of them or ten of them on the same thing?
[32:46.990 --> 32:47.070]  Wow!
[32:47.470 --> 32:49.150]  What if you just get two and listen to them?
[32:51.050 --> 32:57.390]  Do you think if you put it on your forehead and then open your mouth...
[33:00.370 --> 33:02.690]  Like, do you think you'd be like the ultimate speaker?
[33:03.790 --> 33:07.590]  I'm just going to play clips of Geoff speaking that I'll play through my own mouth.
[33:07.830 --> 33:13.330]  Oh, you can fool your friends! That's how you give a speech.
[33:13.410 --> 33:15.990]  You give a speech in a public speaking class.
[33:16.050 --> 33:20.330]  That's how we get people to listen to f**k faces. I'll play it through my mouth and walk through the mall.
[33:21.510 --> 33:23.670]  That guy's talking and that's f**king crazy.
[33:23.850 --> 33:24.730]  You see this? This guy's thinking mall.
[33:24.730 --> 33:25.610]  Oh my god.
[33:27.170 --> 33:31.210]  Again, it is the same trick over and over. I do think it's f**king funny.
[33:31.350 --> 33:35.950]  It's funny. It also could potentially be joined with the magic ear.
[33:36.230 --> 33:38.070]  I thought the same of this together.
[33:40.570 --> 33:41.370]  What do you think?
[33:41.510 --> 33:42.910]  I do. I think it's worth a shot.
[33:43.070 --> 33:44.790]  I think it's good just for the Jurassic Park show.
[33:44.990 --> 33:47.670]  Okay, so do we do?
[33:48.090 --> 33:48.530]  Yes.
[33:49.990 --> 33:51.170]  Do the do.
[33:52.190 --> 33:52.890]  Different thing.
[33:54.730 --> 33:55.630]  Alright, Andrew, what's next?
[33:56.330 --> 33:58.270]  Okay, next one is called the auto hammer.
[33:58.530 --> 33:59.410]  Oh, god.
[33:59.850 --> 34:01.290]  Oh, man.
[34:01.410 --> 34:03.590]  That guy's asking for trouble.
[34:03.890 --> 34:04.430]  Oh, man.
[34:05.330 --> 34:05.810]  Ow!
[34:08.390 --> 34:09.310]  Bam! Bam!
[34:10.050 --> 34:10.790]  What did it do?
[34:10.890 --> 34:12.090]  It just dispensed the nails.
[34:12.890 --> 34:14.630]  Oh my god!
[34:16.210 --> 34:19.190]  Do you think it comes out that perfectly every time?
[34:19.210 --> 34:19.610]  Yes.
[34:19.830 --> 34:21.190]  Look how it rattles around.
[34:21.190 --> 34:21.850]  Yes.
[34:22.110 --> 34:23.770]  You have to hold it at a specific angle.
[34:25.010 --> 34:27.250]  You can't get it in there because you f**king suck.
[34:27.570 --> 34:28.310]  Oh, that's perfect.
[34:29.050 --> 34:31.350]  He just changed the angle that he was hammering.
[34:31.690 --> 34:32.910]  Well, he also didn't hit it.
[34:35.670 --> 34:36.070]  Ah!
[34:36.710 --> 34:38.210]  Oh, we could definitely race these.
[34:38.330 --> 34:39.910]  Look at that technology.
[34:40.650 --> 34:42.270]  Someone's going to f**king break a hand.
[34:42.650 --> 34:45.350]  We've got to see who can hammer in 20 nails the fastest.
[34:45.630 --> 34:46.130]  Oh, yeah.
[34:46.870 --> 34:48.550]  You could put other stuff in it.
[34:48.550 --> 34:50.490]  Oh, I thought they were going to hammer that guy.
[34:50.730 --> 34:51.890]  Alright, we'll tie up again.
[34:55.250 --> 34:56.810]  I wonder if Jeremy Dooley knows that guy.
[34:57.790 --> 34:58.570]  He's from Boston.
[35:01.270 --> 35:03.010]  What are you hammering? Oh, okay.
[35:05.970 --> 35:07.470]  Look at how strong it is.
[35:07.650 --> 35:09.790]  That would have been way cooler if it deposited a nail in that tire.
[35:10.010 --> 35:11.230]  Yeah, and then he hammered that tire.
[35:12.550 --> 35:13.470]  Here's a nail gun.
[35:14.910 --> 35:15.950]  Everything's 20 bucks, baby!
[35:16.850 --> 35:18.690]  Do you get two? Do you get an extra one free?
[35:18.910 --> 35:19.750]  Hang on, we get something else.
[35:19.850 --> 35:21.550]  We get a clip-on level.
[35:22.390 --> 35:24.130]  Now I can know if everything's level.
[35:25.610 --> 35:26.050]  Oh my god.
[35:27.070 --> 35:27.910]  There's more!
[35:28.830 --> 35:29.970]  Welcome to the 100 nails.
[35:30.650 --> 35:32.650]  Why would I need 100?
[35:33.130 --> 35:34.310]  What? Okay, whatever.
[35:36.190 --> 35:37.030]  Okay, so...
[35:38.770 --> 35:39.190]  What...
[35:39.190 --> 35:40.150]  To do...
[35:40.150 --> 35:42.770]  They will not buy it back because they're out of business.
[35:43.010 --> 35:44.270]  I could only find this on eBay.
[35:44.270 --> 35:44.890]  Awesome.
[35:45.110 --> 35:47.590]  So what do you do with the auto-hammer, though?
[35:49.870 --> 35:51.050]  Blindfolded double-hammering?
[35:51.590 --> 35:51.990]  That...
[35:51.990 --> 35:53.530]  Oh, I don't like that.
[35:54.830 --> 35:56.270]  What could we do with it?
[35:56.670 --> 35:58.310]  I wish it would shoot the nail out.
[35:58.370 --> 35:59.310]  Yeah, that's a nail gun.
[35:59.350 --> 36:00.270]  But that's a nail gun does that.
[36:00.310 --> 36:02.290]  Yeah, that's a real thing that exists and you can just get one.
[36:04.170 --> 36:05.270]  I wonder if...
[36:05.270 --> 36:08.150]  Okay, let's say you're doing a nice dinner, right?
[36:08.190 --> 36:11.010]  Like you're having a dinner party and you make a bunch of appetizers.
[36:11.010 --> 36:15.730]  And you need to put toothpicks in each one to make sure everyone's ready.
[36:16.170 --> 36:17.570]  Name a more efficient way.
[36:17.930 --> 36:19.010]  You load it with toothpicks.
[36:19.150 --> 36:21.630]  You load it with magnetic toothpicks?
[36:21.790 --> 36:22.830]  What if...
[36:22.830 --> 36:23.570]  Metal toothpicks?
[36:24.730 --> 36:25.610]  Does it have to be magnetic?
[36:25.970 --> 36:27.630]  That's how it works.
[36:28.030 --> 36:29.230]  That's how it holds the nail.
[36:30.490 --> 36:30.970]  It's a magnet.
[36:31.950 --> 36:34.030]  Because it'd be great if you could run other stuff through it.
[36:34.170 --> 36:36.810]  Imagine if you could run pretzel sticks through it.
[36:36.810 --> 36:37.670]  Yeah, or cheese strings.
[36:37.890 --> 36:39.070]  Or cheese strings or something, yeah.
[36:41.010 --> 36:41.850]  And you just go like...
[36:41.850 --> 36:43.330]  Yeah, like Pez kind of.
[36:43.390 --> 36:50.690]  I mean, you could, but then you're holding a hammer right to someone's face and also it would just come out, right?
[36:51.390 --> 36:52.990]  Yeah, I guess it would just deposit, right?
[36:53.050 --> 36:54.250]  Like a Pez dispenser almost?
[36:54.390 --> 36:55.350]  It would just shoot out.
[36:55.510 --> 36:56.430]  It would just flop.
[36:57.690 --> 37:00.690]  I'm drawing a blank on funny stuff to do with this.
[37:00.750 --> 37:02.890]  I'm having a hard time thinking of what auto-hammer...
[37:02.890 --> 37:05.890]  Because there's so much activity afterward and it's dangerous.
[37:07.310 --> 37:09.750]  Hammer, I just don't trust you guys with hammers.
[37:09.750 --> 37:13.750]  Well, also, all it really does, it doesn't do any hammering for you.
[37:13.830 --> 37:15.070]  It just places a nail.
[37:15.430 --> 37:16.910]  Yes, it should be called the auto-nail.
[37:17.250 --> 37:20.870]  Yeah, and the really dumb thing is, the hammer's already designed to do that on the back end.
[37:20.990 --> 37:21.130]  Yep.
[37:22.030 --> 37:22.590]  That's true.
[37:23.130 --> 37:25.110]  Well, it doesn't put it there for you, though.
[37:25.870 --> 37:28.650]  No, you have to do it yourself. You have to do that one thing yourself.
[37:29.430 --> 37:31.950]  I don't know that we can make the auto-hammer work.
[37:32.390 --> 37:34.930]  I think we can think about it, but if you're asking me...
[37:34.930 --> 37:37.150]  Yeah, maybe our challenge would be to make it automatic.
[37:42.290 --> 37:44.330]  That got Geoff thinking right away.
[37:45.430 --> 37:46.870]  Yeah, I'm too dumb.
[37:46.990 --> 37:51.190]  To be honest, I just like the idea of it more than I think it would have a use.
[37:51.650 --> 37:54.770]  The fact that the auto-hammer existed at one point brings me joy.
[37:54.930 --> 37:55.810]  I'm gonna say no.
[37:55.830 --> 37:56.970]  And I'm sure it was a piece of shit.
[37:57.630 --> 37:59.430]  I think we have to say...
[37:59.430 --> 38:01.410]  I'm gonna say no. We have to say no on something.
[38:02.170 --> 38:03.630]  Otherwise, it looks like we don't have standards.
[38:04.250 --> 38:04.410]  True.
[38:06.350 --> 38:10.430]  I'm excited about this one, because this might, Geoff, cover your fruit gloves thing.
[38:10.530 --> 38:11.070]  Oh, okay.
[38:11.670 --> 38:14.750]  This is a product that I think could have so many uses.
[38:15.110 --> 38:17.970]  Let me introduce you to the tater mitts.
[38:18.070 --> 38:20.330]  Peeling potatoes can take forever.
[38:20.810 --> 38:22.370]  Oh, it's so tough.
[38:23.030 --> 38:23.250]  Careful.
[38:23.970 --> 38:26.850]  I mean, there's a potato peeler you can use.
[38:27.210 --> 38:28.050]  Tater mitts!
[38:29.330 --> 38:30.730]  Are you fucking serious?
[38:30.970 --> 38:32.030]  Dude, that's like fruit gloves.
[38:32.030 --> 38:33.910]  Are you fucking serious?
[38:35.310 --> 38:36.810]  That is phenomenal.
[38:38.090 --> 38:40.510]  It's the hassle-free way to peel potatoes.
[38:40.510 --> 38:42.530]  Can we de-wallpaper a wall?
[38:45.150 --> 38:46.170]  Remove the paint.
[38:48.270 --> 38:48.490]  Wow.
[38:50.050 --> 38:51.510]  Dude, she just fucked that guy.
[38:51.930 --> 38:52.530]  It looks so bad.
[38:54.010 --> 38:56.290]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:57.270 --> 38:57.830]  What a waste.
[38:58.830 --> 38:59.790]  Lethal back rubs?
[39:01.170 --> 39:01.690]  Yeah.
[39:03.310 --> 39:05.850]  You could exfoliate the shit out of somebody's face.
[39:05.850 --> 39:06.270]  Oh, yeah.
[39:07.710 --> 39:11.670]  Yeah, could you, like, rub a hole in a can and drink out of it?
[39:11.810 --> 39:13.590]  It's basically sandpaper gloves.
[39:14.190 --> 39:17.230]  Could you shred, like, pulled pork with this?
[39:18.510 --> 39:19.270]  Shred lettuce.
[39:19.590 --> 39:22.390]  Oh, shred lettuce! You make, like, a whole meal.
[39:22.830 --> 39:26.230]  Do you think the extra grip would help you throw a baseball faster?
[39:26.790 --> 39:27.890]  Oh, that's a good question.
[39:28.130 --> 39:30.990]  Could you take a layer off an egg?
[39:32.810 --> 39:35.050]  Oh, it could be like those assholes on TikTok that are like...
[39:37.070 --> 39:38.530]  Wait, are we on something different?
[39:38.710 --> 39:39.670]  It comes with it.
[39:39.910 --> 39:41.930]  I hate cutting with a knife.
[39:42.190 --> 39:42.830]  Yeah, it's the worst.
[39:43.230 --> 39:44.850]  Oh, it's this thing.
[39:47.230 --> 39:48.670]  It's like a big garlic masta.
[39:49.530 --> 39:50.070]  Yes, it is.
[39:51.270 --> 39:53.670]  Well, let's hope it works...
[39:53.670 --> 39:55.190]  at all better than the Garlic Master.
[39:55.470 --> 39:57.050]  Because that thing's a piece of shit.
[39:58.850 --> 40:02.270]  I think I'm all in on tater mitts.
[40:03.430 --> 40:04.950]  There's just so many things.
[40:05.590 --> 40:07.270]  There's no end of what we could do with the tater mitts.
[40:07.290 --> 40:10.870]  I didn't think about scratching wallpaper off a wall.
[40:11.490 --> 40:14.350]  Do you think you could remove the rind off a watermelon?
[40:15.490 --> 40:16.370]  That would be awesome.
[40:16.610 --> 40:18.410]  Like rub to red? Yeah, rub to red.
[40:20.230 --> 40:20.930]  That's pretty good.
[40:22.290 --> 40:24.250]  What about, like, scratch tickets?
[40:24.250 --> 40:31.050]  Meet someone who has, like, a scratch-ticking glove that's, like, an all-time shot.
[40:32.010 --> 40:33.690]  Andrew, you're gonna be rich.
[40:34.030 --> 40:37.670]  You just revolutionized gambling. Oh, my God.
[40:39.130 --> 40:42.730]  I mean, so, like, yeah, I think this is a yes.
[40:42.750 --> 40:43.850]  Do we do? Yes.
[40:44.990 --> 40:48.590]  That's a fucking... dude, tater mitts are fucking good.
[40:49.150 --> 40:49.630]  Wow!
[40:50.490 --> 40:54.150]  I bet we could restore a rusty old watering can or something.
[40:56.190 --> 41:01.310]  You could be like those TikToks where they take an old tool that's 150 years old and take it apart and sandblast it.
[41:01.570 --> 41:05.910]  Do you think that if you got a new pair of jeans, you could vintage them up a little bit?
[41:06.270 --> 41:08.110]  You could, like, acid-wash your own jeans.
[41:08.830 --> 41:10.010]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[41:10.210 --> 41:12.850]  Okay, I think we're all in on tater mitts.
[41:12.950 --> 41:14.650]  Yeah, we got ideas out of the anus on that one.
[41:15.090 --> 41:17.010]  All right, Andrew, good, great fucking thing.
[41:17.010 --> 41:20.570]  This is it. This is the last one that I'm presenting.
[41:20.570 --> 41:26.810]  And this one, I feel like, could almost be a Hall of Fame entry for a previous product.
[41:27.550 --> 41:29.810]  It is called Maximum Traction.
[41:30.210 --> 41:31.110]  This is Maximum Traction.
[41:31.950 --> 41:32.810]  Oh, no!
[41:33.830 --> 41:35.450]  If only there was more traction!
[41:35.530 --> 41:37.190]  It's like a conversation we were having earlier, Andrew.
[41:37.390 --> 41:38.490]  They're at the fucking mall!
[41:38.770 --> 41:40.650]  That was an actual event? How did I miss it?
[41:43.330 --> 41:45.150]  Oh, it's the Quake's tape guy.
[41:45.430 --> 41:45.750]  Phil Swift!
[41:49.610 --> 41:51.550]  Please be invisible. Please be invisible.
[41:51.650 --> 41:53.130]  It's like the opposite of WD-40.
[41:53.470 --> 41:55.770]  Oh, this... I have so many ideas.
[41:56.010 --> 41:56.570]  Ooh, ice!
[41:58.670 --> 42:00.170]  You can't slip on it!
[42:01.170 --> 42:03.190]  That lady looked evil, right? Like an evil old lady?
[42:04.290 --> 42:04.770]  We...
[42:04.770 --> 42:06.670]  I have...
[42:06.670 --> 42:08.770]  Oh, my God! She just killed that baby!
[42:08.770 --> 42:11.290]  Perfect for wet pool areas.
[42:11.510 --> 42:14.590]  You're not going to slip and fall in wet areas like your bathroom or your kitchen.
[42:14.910 --> 42:16.890]  You will not be walking on it.
[42:17.110 --> 42:18.590]  It's like putting the brakes on in a car.
[42:18.830 --> 42:20.150]  You'd never slip on this.
[42:20.570 --> 42:24.070]  I will save people from getting hurt. I can tell you that.
[42:24.250 --> 42:27.430]  I wonder if you could stop a car faster if you spray the wheels.
[42:28.610 --> 42:30.570]  Maximum traction won't harm delicate...
[42:30.570 --> 42:32.450]  Can we put it on the bottom of a curling iron?
[42:32.930 --> 42:33.690]  Workplace safe.
[42:34.090 --> 42:35.850]  Not like a hair one, like a...
[42:35.850 --> 42:37.210]  Oh, right.
[42:38.770 --> 42:39.370]  Wait, what?
[42:39.890 --> 42:41.610]  Why was it on...
[42:42.230 --> 42:42.650]  What?
[42:43.930 --> 42:45.790]  It glows in the frickin' dark!
[42:46.190 --> 42:47.370]  That's the radioactivity.
[42:48.130 --> 42:50.030]  Why didn't they use this on runways?
[42:51.350 --> 42:51.570]  Oh.
[42:52.470 --> 42:54.710]  I bet you could make planes stop sooner.
[42:55.910 --> 42:57.010]  Cover the runway?
[42:57.310 --> 42:59.910]  We should get a contract with an aircraft carrier. They'd love it.
[43:00.730 --> 43:01.470]  That's a great idea.
[43:01.650 --> 43:03.090]  Okay. What?
[43:03.890 --> 43:05.630]  There's more? Oh, you get a second chance.
[43:05.790 --> 43:06.130]  Oh, okay.
[43:09.310 --> 43:11.470]  I want to get linoleum.
[43:12.070 --> 43:14.830]  I want to slick it up.
[43:15.010 --> 43:15.410]  Okay.
[43:15.510 --> 43:16.490]  I want to put a little bit of oil on it.
[43:16.510 --> 43:16.730]  Okay.
[43:17.050 --> 43:19.250]  I want Gavin to slide on it with his socks.
[43:19.470 --> 43:20.710]  Yeah, until I hit the...
[43:21.250 --> 43:23.230]  But you don't know where those spots are.
[43:25.170 --> 43:28.690]  Until, after you slide on it, we turn off the lights.
[43:29.030 --> 43:32.850]  And you'll be able to see exactly where we put maximum traction.
[43:32.870 --> 43:35.950]  It's like in GTA races where they have the boost and then the slowdown thing.
[43:39.610 --> 43:43.590]  What I really want to see is you guys did the sliding shoe thing.
[43:43.890 --> 43:43.930]  Yes.
[43:44.210 --> 43:48.890]  In the first run. What happens when you put that on maximum traction?
[43:49.030 --> 43:49.410]  Exactly.
[43:49.490 --> 43:50.130]  What wins?
[43:50.410 --> 43:52.050]  Yeah, what wins? That or WD-40?
[43:52.510 --> 43:56.990]  Oh, that's great. Because we're having a battle of two products. Which one's stronger?
[43:57.050 --> 43:57.410]  Absolutely.
[43:57.870 --> 43:59.550]  I love that. It's going to be its own special episode.
[43:59.570 --> 44:02.930]  Can we take it to a water park and just jam up one of the slides with it?
[44:04.450 --> 44:08.190]  We could just fuck up a slide at a playground.
[44:11.310 --> 44:12.570]  No slip and no slide.
[44:12.690 --> 44:13.650]  No slip and slide.
[44:13.970 --> 44:18.110]  That would be so bad if you just put it in the middle of a slip and slide so you have all the momentum.
[44:18.630 --> 44:20.210]  You'd have to call it a walkin' wet.
[44:22.110 --> 44:26.450]  I think we should put someone Andrew's back in the bath and see if he just gets stuck forever.
[44:26.570 --> 44:27.470]  Oh, he'd keep you up.
[44:27.630 --> 44:28.990]  Yeah, he won't slide anymore.
[44:29.390 --> 44:31.010]  I'm already good. I'm already corked up.
[44:31.730 --> 44:33.810]  Think of what you could do with an RC car.
[44:34.770 --> 44:35.330]  You know what I mean?
[44:36.110 --> 44:40.910]  Do you put it on the tires? Can it go up something?
[44:42.990 --> 44:44.690]  Some kind of traction to it.
[44:46.610 --> 44:47.990]  I really like this one, though.
[44:48.170 --> 44:50.270]  I also like that it glows in the dark.
[44:51.090 --> 44:54.110]  Because I do think that we'll show that to Shane.
[44:54.270 --> 44:55.670]  Like, hey, here's this thing we want to do.
[44:56.110 --> 44:58.470]  And then we turn off the lights and we go, by the way, it glows in the dark.
[44:58.550 --> 44:59.530]  And he's going to go, awesome.
[45:00.010 --> 45:01.350]  I think he's going to be into it.
[45:01.350 --> 45:05.970]  Now, do you guys think that it glows in the dark was an intentional feature for the beginning?
[45:06.270 --> 45:11.450]  Or do you think it glows in the dark because we didn't sell that, right?
[45:12.090 --> 45:12.830]  That's probably safe.
[45:14.150 --> 45:18.010]  I think there's something to... I think we can come up with a lot for maximum traction.
[45:18.850 --> 45:23.450]  I'm thinking about some kind of slippery clothes you just can't keep a hold on.
[45:23.610 --> 45:25.550]  And then you just spray a whole shirt with it.
[45:25.950 --> 45:26.850]  You know what I mean?
[45:27.850 --> 45:29.270]  Did you say you want to put it on ice?
[45:29.270 --> 45:30.010]  Yeah.
[45:31.070 --> 45:32.310]  Like a patch of ice, like you were ice skating.
[45:32.690 --> 45:34.550]  Oh, can we? Yeah.
[45:35.430 --> 45:36.550]  You could de-slip ice.
[45:37.210 --> 45:38.770]  What's the slipperiest fruit?
[45:39.470 --> 45:39.690]  Oh.
[45:40.690 --> 45:41.930]  Trying to hang on to something.
[45:42.710 --> 45:47.610]  Oh my God, I was going to say a peeled mango. Oh my God, that is 100% the slipperiest fruit.
[45:49.510 --> 45:54.130]  I have to see. We're going to give a mango a rind with maximum traction.
[45:54.230 --> 45:56.010]  Rerind your peeled mangoes.
[45:57.250 --> 45:59.150]  When you've peeled off more than you can chew.
[46:03.290 --> 46:03.650]  Yeah.
[46:03.650 --> 46:04.730]  We'll peel them with the potato thing.
[46:04.970 --> 46:06.570]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:08.130 --> 46:08.850]  So, do...
[46:08.850 --> 46:10.330]  Yes, we do, we do, we do.
[46:10.830 --> 46:12.510]  I think this is fucking great.
[46:12.990 --> 46:14.230]  Andrew, this is phenomenal.
[46:14.410 --> 46:17.150]  Andrew, you might have just set us up for the whole season.
[46:17.510 --> 46:19.050]  You just greenlit a whole season.
[46:19.250 --> 46:21.470]  Yeah, you literally just gave us a season it doesn't do.
[46:21.590 --> 46:23.310]  We throw that tack shaver back in and we're set.
[46:25.470 --> 46:26.970]  Andrew, you brilliant bastard.
[46:27.130 --> 46:27.490]  Wow.
[46:29.270 --> 46:29.850]  I'm as thrilled as it did.
[46:29.950 --> 46:32.150]  And I just enjoyed so much watching this with you guys.
[46:32.210 --> 46:32.710]  This is great.
[46:32.810 --> 46:36.430]  And I think it'll be so much fun for people to see this maybe post-season.
[46:36.670 --> 46:37.430]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:37.490 --> 46:38.870]  This is where they first saw the products.
[46:39.050 --> 46:42.070]  And then we'll actually also know what these came up.
[46:42.070 --> 46:43.470]  Yeah, like what happened to them.
[46:43.590 --> 46:45.070]  Because I think of all of Rooster Teeth's shows.
[46:46.150 --> 46:48.590]  Does It Do needs like a non-linear timeline.
[46:48.970 --> 46:50.090]  And I think that's...
[46:50.090 --> 46:51.170]  It's like art.
[46:51.510 --> 46:54.710]  It also needs a prequel and a sideshow.
[46:54.850 --> 46:55.050]  Yeah, yeah.
[46:56.050 --> 46:56.990]  I love it.
[46:59.270 --> 46:59.570]  Thank you so much.
[46:59.630 --> 47:00.190]  This was great.
[47:00.350 --> 47:00.950]  Of course.
[47:01.250 --> 47:04.970]  Yeah, thank you guys so much for giving all the amazing ideas that you do.
[47:05.030 --> 47:05.910]  And just making the show.
[47:06.110 --> 47:07.450]  Like Geoff pitching does it.
[47:07.550 --> 47:08.470]  It's so funny.
[47:08.850 --> 47:09.830]  I love the series so much.
[47:09.910 --> 47:12.190]  I'm glad that we could make this for it.
[47:12.250 --> 47:13.490]  I just wish I saw that deck.
[47:16.470 --> 47:19.810]  Geoff grabbed his phone and started looking for it immediately.
[47:20.130 --> 47:21.470]  I think I saw the deck.
[47:21.550 --> 47:22.910]  So I don't know how you didn't see it.
[47:22.990 --> 47:24.450]  He said, Andrew's seen the deck.
[47:24.450 --> 47:29.390]  If you can find an email that I'm on with a Does It Do deck attached to it, then I'll be blown away.
[47:30.070 --> 47:30.910]  Well, okay.
[47:30.990 --> 47:31.550]  Thanks, Andrew.
[47:31.890 --> 47:37.950]  I hope you guys liked season three of season two of Does It Do.
[47:38.890 --> 47:40.450]  Didn't we just do...
[47:40.450 --> 47:43.470]  So the second filming session was still season one.
[47:44.130 --> 47:44.450]  Yes.
[47:44.990 --> 47:45.510]  Yes.
[47:46.910 --> 47:47.350]  Bye.
[47:48.750 --> 47:49.590]  Does It Do?
