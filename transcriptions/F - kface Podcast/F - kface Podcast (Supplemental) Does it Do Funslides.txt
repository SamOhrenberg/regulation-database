[00:00.000 --> 00:06.880]  Fun Slides! Are they fun? Do they slide? We find out today, for you, on Does It Do!
[00:08.260 --> 00:09.960]  This would be like where the intro music goes...
[00:11.020 --> 00:16.560]  Welcome to Does It Do! My name is Geoff, and with me as always is my helpful scientific assistant, Gavin.
[00:17.000 --> 00:20.360]  We work for a company called Uniform. Uniform. Reminds me of the power of one.
[00:20.720 --> 00:22.480]  With the fabric of the farm. Uniform. Excellent.
[00:22.960 --> 00:28.980]  And our job is to test the products you see online, or on television, on social media, wherever you are.
[00:28.980 --> 00:33.140]  We take a look at them for you, and we tell you if they're worth buying, if they do what they say they do.
[00:33.280 --> 00:36.780]  We investigate them using our principle method.
[00:37.220 --> 00:41.600]  The what, the why, and the how does it do?
[00:44.300 --> 00:47.520]  Gavin! Stop. Stop running from the overlays.
[00:47.800 --> 00:48.800]  They cover me up.
[00:48.900 --> 00:50.340]  Why don't you pop these puppies on your feet?
[00:50.540 --> 00:50.900]  Okay.
[00:51.380 --> 00:54.180]  And we'll see... oh, there's instructions. We don't need that.
[00:56.980 --> 00:58.320]  They seem more complicated than...
[00:58.740 --> 01:04.580]  You just strap them on and go. This kid's got a backwards baseball cap on and long hair. He looks like he's ready to shred.
[01:06.040 --> 01:07.720]  I think I'm gonna get hurt again.
[01:08.700 --> 01:13.800]  That's a great point, Gav. I don't want you to get hurt. That's why I've got some safety gear for us.
[01:13.820 --> 01:14.020]  Oh, good.
[01:20.150 --> 01:21.550]  They work immediately.
[01:22.290 --> 01:23.950]  I think I just got a new groin.
[01:23.950 --> 01:26.330]  All right, should we fun slide?
[01:26.610 --> 01:26.730]  Yeah.
[01:27.330 --> 01:29.690]  I can already tell. Jesus.
[01:36.550 --> 01:37.710]  You wanna do a slide race?
[01:37.950 --> 01:41.210]  Yeah. How are we gonna get up to speed?
[01:41.950 --> 01:44.410]  Well, that'll be part of the challenge.
[01:44.830 --> 01:46.490]  One, two, three, go!
[01:49.370 --> 01:49.830]  Whoa!
[01:50.090 --> 01:52.350]  Oh, you won. You beat me. You beat me. You're very fast.
[01:52.470 --> 01:53.870]  That's the coolest thing in the world.
[02:05.640 --> 02:09.340]  Thank God for those pads, huh? I got some ideas for fun things we can try.
[02:10.600 --> 02:13.660]  It's just constant movement. It's the best workout.
[02:15.720 --> 02:17.800]  Oh, hell yeah.
[02:18.500 --> 02:20.600]  All right, we'll see who can pull each other over that line, all right?
[02:20.700 --> 02:20.900]  Okay.
[02:21.220 --> 02:21.400]  Go!
[02:21.960 --> 02:22.400]  Oh, shit.
[02:23.440 --> 02:23.700]  No!
[02:30.000 --> 02:30.760]  I won!
[02:30.760 --> 02:32.860]  Oh, you're scraping my penis.
[02:34.880 --> 02:37.040]  You, like, band-sawed my testicle.
[02:38.180 --> 02:38.660]  I'm gonna help you.
[02:39.780 --> 02:47.760]  Oh, that was pretty good. Why don't we do, like, sledding or whatever?
[02:48.080 --> 02:48.340]  You ready?
[02:48.860 --> 02:49.060]  Yeah.
[02:57.940 --> 02:59.200]  That's my phone gone.
[03:01.140 --> 03:03.760]  Why aren't you doing it right? Do it properly.
[03:04.660 --> 03:06.980]  What do you mean, why am I doing it right? You do it right.
[03:11.860 --> 03:12.360]  You ready?
[03:21.980 --> 03:23.500]  I need one for my back.
[03:24.200 --> 03:24.920]  We can do that.
[03:28.820 --> 03:29.580]  For your back.
[03:30.780 --> 03:32.040]  You might have to tape it on.
[03:32.540 --> 03:33.440]  Yeah, I can do that.
[03:51.270 --> 03:51.650]  Ugh.
[04:00.350 --> 04:00.950]  Close enough.
[04:02.730 --> 04:04.990]  You've covered up the slippery bit, you goon.
[04:05.270 --> 04:06.530]  Oh, you know what, I got an answer for that.
[04:06.890 --> 04:09.690]  Oh, great, yep. Yep, yep, yep.
[04:09.950 --> 04:10.330]  Lubricant.
[04:12.210 --> 04:13.810]  That helps the smell of the fulvara.
[04:14.010 --> 04:14.950]  Wanted to try that anyway.
[04:15.310 --> 04:16.310]  All right, why don't you flip on over.
[04:16.930 --> 04:22.630]  We'll see if we can improve upon these things by adding some WD-40 lubricant to them.
[04:22.750 --> 04:23.110]  All right, you ready?
[04:24.170 --> 04:24.770]  Oh, hold on.
[04:26.250 --> 04:26.650]  Okay.
[04:27.230 --> 04:28.010]  Oh, ow.
[04:28.210 --> 04:28.990]  That's way faster.
[04:31.010 --> 04:31.850]  It's getting hot.
[04:32.130 --> 04:33.950]  It's such a workout.
[04:39.710 --> 04:40.510]  Oh, yeah.
[04:41.290 --> 04:41.970]  See if we can...
[04:43.830 --> 04:46.650]  They definitely do what they say they do, but we're going to see if we can make them do it better.
[04:47.030 --> 04:48.070]  Throw me some feet.
[04:49.770 --> 04:50.550]  Oh, my God.
[04:52.230 --> 04:54.410]  All right, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[04:56.150 --> 04:57.170]  It's too much.
[04:57.670 --> 04:58.330]  They're too slippery.
[05:00.650 --> 05:02.230]  It works too well.
[05:02.570 --> 05:04.210]  Oh, that really does make a difference.
[05:13.230 --> 05:15.390]  All right, throw me the rope.
[05:15.670 --> 05:16.070]  Okay.
[05:16.490 --> 05:17.880]  It's going to be like curling.
[05:20.790 --> 05:21.950]  All right.
[05:24.870 --> 05:25.630]  You ready?
[05:25.730 --> 05:26.990]  Three, two, one.
[05:28.730 --> 05:30.630]  Oh, my God, that's amazing.
[05:31.930 --> 05:32.800]  That worked amazing.
[05:35.630 --> 05:39.710]  I got to say, Gav, this thing does what it says it does.
[05:41.330 --> 05:43.230]  And you can make it better with WD-40.
[05:43.590 --> 05:44.670]  Oh, I sat in Bovril.
[05:47.070 --> 05:48.330]  That'll happen, damn it.
[05:49.470 --> 05:50.630]  Should we have a running race?
[05:51.150 --> 05:52.110]  Yeah, let's have a running race.
[05:53.490 --> 05:54.530]  No sliding allowed.
[05:54.730 --> 05:54.910]  Okay.
[05:56.250 --> 05:57.230]  Three, two, one, go.
[06:05.230 --> 06:05.650]  Yeah.
[06:05.650 --> 06:06.190]  All right.
[06:09.110 --> 06:09.890]  These are great.
[06:11.850 --> 06:12.810]  I got another idea.
[06:12.870 --> 06:13.830]  One last idea on the feet.
[06:14.070 --> 06:14.510]  Oh, there's more?
[06:14.730 --> 06:15.990]  Yeah, and then one other thing we can try.
[06:16.090 --> 06:16.290]  Okay.
[06:17.070 --> 06:18.230]  I'm Velcroed to the carpet.
[06:19.630 --> 06:21.490]  Here's what I want you to do.
[06:22.470 --> 06:23.210]  Hold the rope.
[06:24.230 --> 06:25.150]  Give me some slack.
[06:26.810 --> 06:28.030]  We're going to see if this is fun.
[06:29.210 --> 06:29.850]  All right, are we ready?
[06:35.350 --> 06:35.710]  Yep.
[06:37.470 --> 06:37.830]  Go.
[06:39.790 --> 06:40.110]  Oh!
[06:43.770 --> 06:46.470]  That was like falling into a helicopter rotor.
[06:47.350 --> 06:48.430]  Your legs were a blur.
[06:48.910 --> 06:49.270]  All right, Gav.
[06:50.170 --> 06:51.010]  That was a good workout.
[06:51.790 --> 06:53.050]  It definitely does all those things.
[06:53.950 --> 06:55.570]  We're definitely headed for the wall of dew.
[06:56.490 --> 06:57.610]  I got one last thing I want to try.
[06:58.510 --> 06:59.490]  I can't get this rope off.
[06:59.530 --> 06:59.970]  We'll keep it on.
[07:00.730 --> 07:03.010]  We've established it does the hell out of what it says it does.
[07:03.730 --> 07:05.290]  It even does it better if we want it to.
[07:06.310 --> 07:07.110]  But I got another idea.
[07:07.570 --> 07:16.030]  You ever seen in the movies like Cocktail with Tom Cruise or one of those other movies where maybe you go to a fancy bar and they'll slide the drink down to you?
[07:16.890 --> 07:17.050]  Yep.
[07:17.330 --> 07:18.950]  A lot of bars just aren't equipped to do that.
[07:19.830 --> 07:24.490]  You order a wine, or in my case, sparkling apple juice.
[07:26.870 --> 07:27.450]  God damn.
[07:27.690 --> 07:27.890]  All right.
[07:28.530 --> 07:30.550]  And you want to slide it across the table like a cool bartender.
[07:30.690 --> 07:30.830]  Yeah.
[07:31.250 --> 07:31.910]  We'll see what happens.
[07:33.270 --> 07:34.630]  Yeah, that doesn't work for shit, right?
[07:34.810 --> 07:35.170]  Rubbish.
[07:35.750 --> 07:36.110]  Rubbish.
[07:39.210 --> 07:42.550]  However, pop this puppy on a fun slide.
[07:43.150 --> 07:43.730]  Thank you.
[07:45.370 --> 07:47.970]  All right, let me spray the underneath of this.
[07:48.390 --> 07:51.430]  Yeah, that was a little bit of me, a little bit of me, a little bit of me.
[07:52.970 --> 07:54.530]  And you're going to be, I'm going to be the bartender.
[07:55.050 --> 07:56.850]  You'll be a lady ordering a glass of wine.
[07:59.850 --> 08:01.710]  Hey, what's up there, little lady?
[08:01.730 --> 08:02.430]  What can I do for you?
[08:02.530 --> 08:03.890]  I'll have a pint of wine.
[08:04.090 --> 08:04.770]  A pint of wine?
[08:04.850 --> 08:05.010]  Yep.
[08:05.010 --> 08:06.150]  One coming right up.
[08:06.210 --> 08:08.030]  You'll be the slider to your cool style like it's in the movies.
[08:08.050 --> 08:08.970]  I'm not getting up for it.
[08:09.050 --> 08:09.870]  All right, here we go.
[08:11.210 --> 08:11.930]  Thank you.
[08:13.250 --> 08:14.470]  That was amazing.
[08:15.610 --> 08:16.370]  Hey, you know what?
[08:16.370 --> 08:17.070]  I wanted it hot.
[08:17.230 --> 08:17.970]  I'm sending it back.
[08:20.390 --> 08:20.750]  Perfect.
[08:22.410 --> 08:23.130]  Absolutely perfect.
[08:23.230 --> 08:24.070]  Works almost too well.
[08:25.550 --> 08:27.070]  Well, there you have it.
[08:28.970 --> 08:30.150]  The fun slide.
[08:32.070 --> 08:32.790]  It does.
[08:33.430 --> 08:34.750]  It does what it says it does.
[08:35.430 --> 08:39.850]  It does what it says it does better with modifications, and it does other shit just as well.
[08:40.350 --> 08:43.970]  Not only is this in the Wall of Do, I think this is the Wall of Do Hall of Fame.
[08:50.710 --> 08:52.110]  Geoff, put it in! Go on, Geoff!
[08:52.190 --> 08:52.630]  I can't.
[08:52.710 --> 08:53.430]  You can do it, my son!
[08:53.430 --> 08:54.010]  It works too well.
[08:54.530 --> 08:55.750]  I got it. I'm going to get there.
[09:05.440 --> 09:06.820]  Well, there you have it.
[09:07.700 --> 09:08.420]  Fun slides.
[09:09.220 --> 09:10.900]  Both fun and slidey.
[09:11.220 --> 09:11.980]  Thanks for tuning in.
[09:11.980 --> 09:15.520]  We'll see you next time for another episode of Does It Do?
[09:22.960 --> 09:23.700]  I'm sweaty.
[09:24.420 --> 09:25.240]  I'm very wet.
