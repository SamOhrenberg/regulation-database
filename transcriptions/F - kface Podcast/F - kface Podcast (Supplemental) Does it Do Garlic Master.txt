[00:00.000 --> 00:05.060]  Garlic Master, is it really? Find out today on Does It Do.
[00:06.500 --> 00:09.960]  Does it do, and then we did the thing, and now it's a position...
[00:09.960 --> 00:12.640]  Welcome to Does It Do. My name is Geoff, and with me as always, Gavin.
[00:12.980 --> 00:17.920]  We are two employees at Unifarm. Unifarm, combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm.
[00:19.200 --> 00:23.640]  Unifarm's research department. We take a look at products that you may have found on the internet
[00:23.640 --> 00:28.240]  or on social media that seem interesting, seem like maybe time savers. We check them, Gavin,
[00:28.240 --> 00:37.660]  for the what? The who? The how, why, and who does it do? Gavin, this new Garlic Master
[00:38.260 --> 00:43.940]  proclaims that it is the premium quality garlic cutter. That's how I like my garlic. You like it
[00:43.940 --> 00:48.160]  cut in a premium way? It's too big normally. Yeah, you don't want to eat a whole clove of garlic.
[00:48.240 --> 00:51.840]  Definitely not. All right, so let's get, let's tear into one. You want to grab one out of there too?
[00:53.160 --> 00:57.760]  Do something with those hands? Okay. Garlic peeler. We're not looking to peel garlic,
[00:57.760 --> 01:09.970]  we're looking to chop garlic. And... Is it open now? Or closed? Open? Closed. But which is which?
[01:10.150 --> 01:13.450]  Open. You didn't read the instructions either, huh? I think I broke this one. Oh,
[01:13.670 --> 01:22.370]  shit. Did you break it too? Yep. Do you want that bit back?
[01:28.860 --> 01:35.620]  Garlic Master. It's the premium quality garlic cutter, so they say. Now you know what's inside.
[01:36.280 --> 01:41.320]  Let's just take a quick look at these instructions. Not that we need them, mind you.
[01:42.460 --> 01:48.940]  Careful. Don't garlic your fingers. Where does the garlic go? Use this instructions. Hold the
[01:48.940 --> 01:56.280]  Garlic Master at the lower part. Untwist the locking screw counterclockwise. Done. Wait. Oh.
[01:56.280 --> 02:06.500]  No, I don't think you do that. Wait. Yeah. Done. Oh. So put the garlic peeled. We don't have time
[02:06.500 --> 02:10.360]  to peel the garlic. Just stuff it in there full. Put the peeled garlic clove. There you go.
[02:10.540 --> 02:15.220]  Carefully cut off the hard end of the... Shut up. We don't need that. Put the locking screw. Place
[02:15.220 --> 02:19.280]  the locking screw on the lower part and turn clockwise until it stops. Now the Garlic Master's
[02:19.280 --> 02:24.620]  closed and ready to use. Do you twist it or slam it? I think you twist it.
[02:27.060 --> 02:33.020]  Oh my god. Oh, look, look. It's coming through. Wait, let me get the shell. No, I think you turn
[02:33.020 --> 02:51.190]  that to... Look. Oh. Ah. Here. Garlic in my mouth. I didn't get any. You know what I'm noticing? I
[02:51.190 --> 03:06.820]  think we only need this bit. Yeah. I don't under... I don't like garlic. I don't like garlic.
[03:06.820 --> 03:26.050]  Do you like banana? I don't like garlic. I don't like garlic. I like banana. That's better.
[03:27.630 --> 03:34.690]  Garlic Master. Premium quality garlic cutter. I'll be honest with you.
[03:36.190 --> 03:45.380]  I'm not sensing a lot of premium in any of this. If we put banana in there. You know how many
[03:45.380 --> 03:51.880]  bananas there are in the world, Gavin? At least 12. There's over a thousand kinds of bananas.
[03:52.540 --> 03:56.480]  100 billion bananas are eaten each year. I know that because I'm a banana guy.
[03:59.780 --> 04:07.660]  Is it getting lower? Here we go. Do you want some banana? Yeah.
[04:11.250 --> 04:17.810]  Oh, where's this one been? It's a fresh, it's a fresh, it's a fresh Garlic Master. So it's...
[04:17.810 --> 04:25.230]  You're missing a banana. You're missing a good banana. How's that taste? Really good.
[04:25.730 --> 04:43.340]  That's some good nans. Here's a... yeah, yeah. I want my nanner. Good. It also says it's great for
[04:43.340 --> 04:48.880]  potatoes, pasta, chicken, and shrimp. Let's try some. Here you go. Maybe it provides like a good
[04:48.880 --> 04:53.240]  whipping base. It says it's good for pasta. Let's see what that's about. Well, it's spaghettifying
[04:53.240 --> 04:55.740]  the nanna to the point where you could do this, but open your mouth. Okay.
[04:59.860 --> 05:03.920]  That was, that was aggressive. That was aggressively hard.
[05:05.360 --> 05:09.460]  Yeah, it gets it prepared for whipping. Banana!
[05:14.340 --> 05:16.600]  It says it's great for pasta. Let's see.
[05:34.240 --> 05:43.820]  Garlic Master. It is not the master of garlic or pasta. Barely bananas. This is what we in
[05:43.820 --> 05:48.780]  Does It Do, I think I speak for all of us here, like to call a hunk of shit.
[05:57.720 --> 06:01.760]  Tune in next time for another episode of Does It Do?
