[00:14.960 --> 00:15.880]  Well, here we are.
[00:18.400 --> 00:19.060]  Office day.
[00:19.900 --> 00:20.800]  Is this the entrance?
[00:21.560 --> 00:24.500]  Eric said that this is the only time we'll ever use the pizza oven.
[00:25.100 --> 00:25.880]  And that that's it.
[00:26.060 --> 00:28.800]  But I say, and Nick agreed very quickly,
[00:29.080 --> 00:33.120]  this will be a semi-regular thing and we'll keep coming up with recipes and improving.
[00:33.300 --> 00:35.320]  It all goes into the cookbook.
[00:35.440 --> 00:39.100]  Hi, welcome to the supplementary episode of F*** Face.
[00:39.160 --> 00:41.000]  We've gotten together at Geoff's house to cook these pizzas.
[00:41.000 --> 00:42.680]  It's how you set the scene.
[00:42.740 --> 00:44.940]  But this is like 20 minutes into the pizza video, isn't it?
[00:45.040 --> 00:45.960]  Is this a separate thing?
[00:46.380 --> 00:49.480]  Are we not releasing audio of this?
[00:50.300 --> 00:51.440]  As an audio podcast?
[00:51.860 --> 00:51.880]  Oh!
[00:53.940 --> 00:55.280]  Are you for real?
[00:55.580 --> 00:57.280]  See, this is why he produces.
[00:57.780 --> 00:59.540]  It's an audio podcast!
[01:01.000 --> 01:01.940]  He's right. He's totally right.
[01:02.320 --> 01:04.020]  There are people who just want this!
[01:04.340 --> 01:04.980]  He's totally right.
[01:05.920 --> 01:07.300]  No, you're right. That's a good point.
[01:07.300 --> 01:12.240]  Well, in that case, let me just say, we just filmed episode 128 yesterday.
[01:12.940 --> 01:13.680]  And then this today.
[01:13.820 --> 01:15.700]  Eric has been on point with the intros.
[01:15.920 --> 01:18.020]  I nominate Eric for season 5 intro guy.
[01:18.580 --> 01:22.320]  It's so easy to set the scene and then you go.
[01:22.580 --> 01:24.380]  I don't...
[01:24.380 --> 01:28.020]  Welcome to F*** Face Supplementary Pizza Podcast number 1.
[01:28.140 --> 01:29.440]  Office day number 2.
[01:29.600 --> 01:30.620]  Not quite sausage talk.
[01:30.960 --> 01:33.740]  It's Geoff, it's Gavin, it's Andrew.
[01:33.980 --> 01:35.540]  Nick and Emily also here.
[01:35.540 --> 01:39.140]  We're recording live at Geoff's house.
[01:39.260 --> 01:40.380]  Geoff and Emily's house. I'm sorry, Emily.
[01:40.820 --> 01:43.140]  Geoff and Emily's house, which is beautiful, Emily.
[01:43.580 --> 01:44.620]  It's absolutely gorgeous.
[01:45.020 --> 01:46.240]  Only she gets the compliment for that.
[01:47.120 --> 01:47.600]  Yeah.
[01:48.200 --> 01:50.200]  As if I'm some design scrub.
[01:50.420 --> 01:54.880]  I will say, I don't think it would look like this if you were to decorate it.
[01:57.680 --> 02:00.720]  Andrew is in his home in Canada.
[02:00.780 --> 02:01.100]  I am.
[02:01.260 --> 02:04.160]  And is trying to make a similar pizza.
[02:04.160 --> 02:06.540]  And that's the scene. Take it away.
[02:06.740 --> 02:08.500]  Well, yeah, I don't know.
[02:08.600 --> 02:11.060]  Similar is... I went a completely different direction.
[02:11.260 --> 02:11.900]  Not similar.
[02:12.180 --> 02:13.620]  To be honest.
[02:14.220 --> 02:18.240]  I did ask Eric to forward me the list of ingredients that they were going to get.
[02:18.640 --> 02:21.080]  But then Geoff just decided to make a pepperoni pizza.
[02:21.200 --> 02:22.700]  So I didn't feel like I needed to follow up.
[02:22.700 --> 02:23.940]  Well, I still made my pizza.
[02:24.120 --> 02:27.160]  Just so you know, pepperonis on the list.
[02:28.860 --> 02:29.580]  There you go.
[02:30.420 --> 02:30.640]  Yeah.
[02:31.400 --> 02:32.700]  So what did you make?
[02:32.840 --> 02:34.460]  Do you want to see us first?
[02:34.660 --> 02:38.200]  I did a very basic barbecue base pizza.
[02:38.360 --> 02:38.820]  With some cheese.
[02:38.980 --> 02:40.280]  Cheese barbecue pizza.
[02:40.520 --> 02:42.600]  What kind of barbecue sauce did you use as the base?
[02:43.460 --> 02:47.440]  I used a Rufus Teague barbecue sauce.
[02:47.820 --> 02:48.640]  As the base sauce.
[02:48.840 --> 02:51.280]  Is Rufus Teague a famous Canadian barbecue master?
[02:52.020 --> 02:53.520]  I don't know anything about...
[02:53.520 --> 02:55.180]  What was the woman that made the baskets?
[02:55.440 --> 02:59.400]  I know less about the barbecue guy than I know about Leona Waddell.
[02:59.460 --> 03:00.240]  I think was her name.
[03:00.240 --> 03:01.820]  On the scale of knowing.
[03:02.140 --> 03:07.440]  Can I ask, are you saying that you just put barbecue sauce instead of tomato sauce and then put cheese on top of it?
[03:08.100 --> 03:08.400]  Yeah.
[03:08.860 --> 03:09.980]  That's exactly what I did.
[03:10.440 --> 03:12.240]  Did it usually have chicken or something on it?
[03:12.960 --> 03:14.640]  No, absolutely. Yeah, I didn't have chicken.
[03:15.800 --> 03:16.660]  Wasn't on the list.
[03:16.900 --> 03:20.040]  I'll tell you what, Andrew. I didn't have any of the stuff that I used today.
[03:20.240 --> 03:20.920]  We just got it.
[03:22.220 --> 03:22.880]  No, that's fair.
[03:23.080 --> 03:23.280]  Yeah.
[03:25.040 --> 03:26.740]  Listen, I'm cooking out of a skillet.
[03:26.740 --> 03:28.700]  If we want to be honest, I realized phase one.
[03:28.860 --> 03:34.980]  I was in trouble when last night I went to remove my dough from the freezer, which had been there a while.
[03:35.140 --> 03:38.100]  And I learned it expired like seven months ago.
[03:38.180 --> 03:40.060]  So I didn't have much hope for this.
[03:40.060 --> 03:41.480]  Just generally speaking.
[03:41.680 --> 03:45.040]  He was going to make pizza any day now for about a year.
[03:45.580 --> 03:45.620]  I left it.
[03:45.860 --> 03:48.740]  Now, is that in your little mini fridge in your bedroom?
[03:49.440 --> 03:50.080]  No, no, no.
[03:50.120 --> 03:51.160]  That's a proper fridge.
[03:51.180 --> 03:52.940]  I don't have a freezer in my little mini fridge.
[03:53.080 --> 03:54.340]  So this is properly frozen.
[03:55.520 --> 03:58.500]  But yeah, the yeast was not great.
[03:58.840 --> 03:59.520]  Probably died.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.340]  Didn't rise very much.
[04:04.370 --> 04:05.290]  Kind of flat.
[04:05.470 --> 04:06.210]  Kind of hard.
[04:07.230 --> 04:08.750]  In ways I can't describe.
[04:09.070 --> 04:11.270]  Maybe that's the death of the yeast in the dough.
[04:11.510 --> 04:14.130]  I've taken a variety of photos to show you my dough.
[04:14.270 --> 04:15.910]  I've made several pizzas this month.
[04:15.930 --> 04:16.710]  Should we switch to a...
[04:16.710 --> 04:18.750]  So what did you do then?
[04:19.510 --> 04:20.450]  What do you mean, what did I do?
[04:20.590 --> 04:22.410]  Did you use the seven month expired dough?
[04:23.530 --> 04:24.250]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:24.370 --> 04:26.330]  It's been frozen this entire time.
[04:27.190 --> 04:28.850]  You're gonna die.
[04:29.210 --> 04:30.410]  He's gonna get botulism.
[04:31.250 --> 04:32.150]  It's just yeast.
[04:32.350 --> 04:33.530]  It's just the yeast that died.
[04:33.950 --> 04:35.250]  I'm not gonna die, the yeast died.
[04:35.250 --> 04:36.790]  It's only some of it that's dead.
[04:36.950 --> 04:38.090]  Why don't you show us?
[04:39.710 --> 04:41.830]  Okay, let me pull up my phone.
[04:42.490 --> 04:43.750]  So this has been a journey as a whole.
[04:43.850 --> 04:47.290]  So I'm gonna show you guys mine before I get to see the pizzas that you made.
[04:47.350 --> 04:47.590]  Yeah.
[04:47.890 --> 04:48.830]  I'm guessing based on this setup.
[04:48.830 --> 04:51.470]  Okay, so we're gonna go on a little bit of a journey.
[04:51.570 --> 04:52.570]  So I used a skillet.
[04:52.750 --> 04:55.870]  The tiny waffle maker skillet version you guys had.
[04:55.990 --> 04:56.490]  So this is...
[04:56.950 --> 04:58.710]  This is my first...
[04:58.710 --> 05:00.490]  This is my first attempt, okay?
[05:00.570 --> 05:02.010]  So I made a tiny little baby pizza.
[05:02.130 --> 05:05.450]  I used a McDonald's million dollar game piece for scale.
[05:06.070 --> 05:08.490]  So you can see the size of how tiny it is.
[05:08.610 --> 05:08.750]  Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
[05:08.890 --> 05:09.270]  God.
[05:10.350 --> 05:11.710]  I went with a tiny little pizza.
[05:11.830 --> 05:12.570]  He made pizza chips.
[05:14.130 --> 05:14.710]  What'd he say?
[05:14.710 --> 05:16.990]  Pizza chips! That sounds amazing!
[05:17.450 --> 05:19.230]  Yeah, it's a little pizza chip.
[05:19.230 --> 05:21.510]  That's a great idea. I thought about getting Pringles pizza chips.
[05:21.590 --> 05:23.050]  To maybe put those in the mix.
[05:23.070 --> 05:24.250]  But I didn't. So I let that cook.
[05:24.330 --> 05:25.950]  I wasn't confident it would cook at all.
[05:26.030 --> 05:28.490]  It did. It rose. It even rose.
[05:28.570 --> 05:30.690]  There's still some yeast alive in that son of a bitch.
[05:30.750 --> 05:34.050]  And I prepared a second tiny little pizza.
[05:34.170 --> 05:35.130]  Which I put on.
[05:35.550 --> 05:36.150]  And let me say.
[05:36.810 --> 05:39.210]  It looked fucking delicious as it cooked.
[05:39.590 --> 05:40.490]  It rose. It cooked.
[05:40.650 --> 05:41.670]  You got a little cheese going.
[05:41.670 --> 05:43.670]  That one actually looked pretty god damn good.
[05:43.970 --> 05:46.770]  So that's my tiny little pizza I had.
[05:47.470 --> 05:49.570]  And every time. Every pizza I made.
[05:49.630 --> 05:51.510]  I got like Italian pizza hands.
[05:51.590 --> 05:53.350]  Because I'd make a pizza and I'd grow confident.
[05:53.630 --> 05:55.130]  So we finished the little guy.
[05:55.390 --> 05:57.690]  Put that to the side. We started working bigger.
[05:57.910 --> 05:59.930]  We're getting a little bit bigger with every little pizza.
[06:00.290 --> 06:01.370]  I ate the little one.
[06:01.570 --> 06:03.530]  Honestly delicious. It was fantastic.
[06:03.970 --> 06:05.110]  It's fantastic pizza.
[06:05.570 --> 06:07.030]  I ate the second one.
[06:07.290 --> 06:09.270]  That you see next to it as well.
[06:09.270 --> 06:10.090]  I cooked that up.
[06:10.590 --> 06:12.090]  I took a bite. I was so excited.
[06:12.250 --> 06:13.950]  I ate it before I could even take a photo.
[06:14.530 --> 06:15.330]  Very doughy.
[06:17.090 --> 06:18.570]  Didn't cook all the way through.
[06:18.870 --> 06:20.850]  Was the problem on that one.
[06:21.150 --> 06:23.010]  But we kept trying. And we just kept getting bigger.
[06:23.070 --> 06:25.130]  We gotta get more cheese in the mix.
[06:25.310 --> 06:25.810]  Oh wow.
[06:27.950 --> 06:30.190]  Your pizza confidence is growing.
[06:30.530 --> 06:31.150]  It is incredible.
[06:31.170 --> 06:33.110]  It is. Yeah. It has grown exponentially.
[06:33.610 --> 06:35.610]  Got that cooking in the skillet.
[06:35.970 --> 06:37.230]  I couldn't close the lid.
[06:37.230 --> 06:38.870]  Because it was burning the top of the cheese.
[06:39.050 --> 06:40.590]  Which was a problem I should have considered.
[06:41.130 --> 06:42.870]  Beforehand. So we went open faced.
[06:43.210 --> 06:46.370]  And this is what is currently sitting next to me.
[06:46.810 --> 06:47.850]  Ready to be enjoyed.
[06:48.330 --> 06:49.830]  It's gonna be very doughy.
[06:50.050 --> 06:51.690]  It doesn't look very much like a pizza.
[06:51.970 --> 06:53.310]  It's barbecue sauce.
[06:53.430 --> 06:55.090]  It's barbecue sauce on dough.
[06:55.250 --> 06:56.750]  With some cheese melted on top.
[06:57.570 --> 06:59.170]  You can't really see the pizza.
[07:00.490 --> 07:00.730]  What?
[07:01.310 --> 07:03.010]  Is that the crust of the top?
[07:03.350 --> 07:05.050]  It spilled over quite a lot.
[07:05.050 --> 07:07.250]  It looks like the blob from the blob.
[07:07.730 --> 07:08.430]  It does.
[07:09.710 --> 07:11.230]  It looks like remnants
[07:11.230 --> 07:12.970]  of the marshmallow man
[07:12.970 --> 07:13.750]  from Ghostbusters.
[07:14.210 --> 07:15.690]  You shot a chunk off him.
[07:17.190 --> 07:18.970]  Yeah, it's not great. It's gonna be bad.
[07:19.030 --> 07:21.070]  But the little ones I'm telling you are fucking delicious.
[07:21.190 --> 07:21.830]  They look pretty good.
[07:21.970 --> 07:23.130]  That little baby one.
[07:24.430 --> 07:25.870]  Let's stay on that.
[07:26.250 --> 07:28.230]  I love that.
[07:29.150 --> 07:30.950]  He kind of fell to his pizza hubris.
[07:31.530 --> 07:33.090]  He got pretty confident.
[07:33.090 --> 07:34.970]  It's like confidence, quality.
[07:35.030 --> 07:38.930]  Yeah, it's a great scale.
[07:40.390 --> 07:41.290]  I'm excited to see
[07:41.290 --> 07:42.510]  what you all did.
[07:42.610 --> 07:45.090]  I had a belief going in that mine would be undercooked
[07:45.090 --> 07:46.230]  and yours would be charcoal.
[07:46.550 --> 07:48.070]  Was how I assumed it would go.
[07:49.310 --> 07:51.290]  I said yesterday that it would be
[07:51.290 --> 07:53.110]  two ends of a different shit spectrum.
[07:54.630 --> 07:56.710]  Now, which do you want to start?
[07:56.770 --> 07:58.890]  Do you want to start with Geoff's pizza or do you want to start with Gavin's pizza?
[07:58.950 --> 07:59.510]  Or Eric's.
[07:59.510 --> 08:01.110]  I made a baby one.
[08:01.230 --> 08:02.390]  Oh, Eric made a pizza too?
[08:02.450 --> 08:04.890]  Yours might be good to start with because it would take over from his size.
[08:05.230 --> 08:06.130]  Oh, we can grow in size.
[08:06.910 --> 08:08.450]  We'll present our pizzas to you, Andrew.
[08:08.490 --> 08:09.430]  I'll monitor the camera.
[08:11.370 --> 08:13.490]  So your pizza is slightly bigger?
[08:13.650 --> 08:14.230]  Is that what you're saying?
[08:15.210 --> 08:16.630]  This is my baby pizza.
[08:17.750 --> 08:19.670]  Oh, this is Eric's. That looks delicious.
[08:20.090 --> 08:20.430]  Thank you.
[08:20.630 --> 08:21.530]  That looks great.
[08:23.430 --> 08:25.110]  It's a regular pepperoni pizza.
[08:25.790 --> 08:28.250]  And I did a crescent roll stuffed crust
[08:28.250 --> 08:29.870]  with mozzarella cheese on the outside.
[08:31.010 --> 08:31.730]  That's fantastic.
[08:31.970 --> 08:33.570]  There you go. I'm pretty happy about that.
[08:33.710 --> 08:35.870]  I want a piece of that.
[08:35.910 --> 08:36.770]  Right? Not bad.
[08:38.890 --> 08:40.610]  Andrew, that's the first of our pizzas.
[08:41.490 --> 08:42.730]  Do we want to go to Geoff's now?
[08:42.890 --> 08:43.470]  I think we should go to Geoff's.
[08:44.810 --> 08:46.650]  And then we can tuck in all together.
[08:48.110 --> 08:50.110]  Because Geoff's is very similar, I believe.
[08:50.270 --> 08:51.830]  It's just a pepperoni pizza as well,
[08:52.150 --> 08:52.890]  from what I understand.
[08:53.670 --> 08:56.050]  Yeah, this is a nice, lovely pepperoni.
[08:56.050 --> 08:57.250]  I don't like the way he's got the knife out.
[08:57.470 --> 08:59.090]  We don't have a pizza cutter.
[09:01.790 --> 09:04.130]  You know what? That's not as overcooked,
[09:04.230 --> 09:06.210]  for sure, but it's not nearly as bad
[09:06.210 --> 09:08.410]  as I expected. That looks like a store-bought pizza.
[09:08.510 --> 09:10.010]  That doesn't look like a pizza...
[09:10.010 --> 09:10.430]  How's that?
[09:11.950 --> 09:13.910]  Yeah, it looks fine.
[09:14.030 --> 09:14.590]  Wow, he's not impressed.
[09:14.810 --> 09:17.210]  He was so complimentary of mine.
[09:17.790 --> 09:18.670]  Yeah, it was okay.
[09:19.510 --> 09:20.710]  It's a little too flat for me.
[09:21.250 --> 09:22.450]  I like a thicker crust, personally.
[09:22.450 --> 09:22.990]  Okay.
[09:23.630 --> 09:24.930]  And now, Gavin.
[09:25.510 --> 09:26.590]  I'll be right back, Andrew.
[09:28.590 --> 09:30.210]  Let me set this down.
[09:31.510 --> 09:32.790]  So far, I'd say Eric is winning.
[09:33.110 --> 09:33.670]  Well, thank you.
[09:34.230 --> 09:35.090]  I'm hard to disagree.
[09:35.270 --> 09:36.630]  He's not going to be very nice.
[09:38.330 --> 09:40.090]  Gavin said Andrew's not going to be very nice.
[09:40.910 --> 09:41.610]  Alright, Andrew, you ready?
[09:41.970 --> 09:43.350]  Let's see yours.
[09:43.710 --> 09:44.710]  The Plowman's Pizza.
[09:45.530 --> 09:48.070]  Well, it looks like it was made by a plowman.
[09:48.530 --> 09:50.210]  It has your staple to it.
[09:50.210 --> 09:52.010]  Let me introduce you to some of the ingredients.
[09:52.910 --> 09:57.570]  Obviously, we've got the Branston Pickle stuffed crust that Eric decided we should make.
[09:57.730 --> 09:59.710]  We've got some ham under there.
[09:59.970 --> 10:00.930]  All English cheddar.
[10:01.550 --> 10:03.730]  We've got some boiled eggs, sliced.
[10:04.290 --> 10:05.310]  We've got some chutney.
[10:05.670 --> 10:06.710]  We've got some Piccadilly.
[10:07.190 --> 10:10.710]  And under one side is a load of pickled onion.
[10:12.090 --> 10:13.690]  That looks so bad.
[10:14.130 --> 10:15.310]  That looks terrible.
[10:15.950 --> 10:20.770]  It looks like whoever cooked it realized the Branston was shit and tried to burn it out.
[10:20.850 --> 10:23.650]  Just like all of your edges are fucked.
[10:24.230 --> 10:28.330]  By the way, this happened within about 16 seconds of being in there.
[10:29.270 --> 10:30.990]  I can't wait to see the video.
[10:31.950 --> 10:34.270]  Well, the presentation is done.
[10:34.590 --> 10:36.010]  Geoff left to go get another soda.
[10:39.290 --> 10:41.710]  So we're going to try each of these pizzas.
[10:42.210 --> 10:43.470]  Which one do we want to try first?
[10:43.470 --> 10:44.290]  Do we want to go down the line?
[10:44.370 --> 10:45.770]  Do we want to save Branston for last?
[10:46.030 --> 10:47.610]  Or do you want to tuck right into it?
[10:47.690 --> 10:49.290]  Because then we'll be full and we won't need to eat it.
[10:51.330 --> 10:51.930]  Thank you.
[10:52.370 --> 10:53.910]  Okay, I guess we'll...
[10:53.910 --> 10:54.630]  God, what a knife.
[10:54.930 --> 10:55.370]  Great knife.
[10:58.230 --> 11:01.010]  Okay, we're going to tuck into my tiny pep.
[11:02.130 --> 11:03.370]  So here we have
[11:04.490 --> 11:06.150]  Eric's tiny ratman pizza.
[11:06.930 --> 11:09.390]  We have Geoff's simple pepperoni pizza.
[11:09.570 --> 11:11.170]  And we have Gavin's plowman special.
[11:13.470 --> 11:15.130]  All three are going to go in the recipe book.
[11:16.810 --> 11:17.630]  Look at that.
[11:18.570 --> 11:19.970]  Imagine if this was a pizza cutter.
[11:20.250 --> 11:21.290]  That would be crazy.
[11:22.270 --> 11:24.250]  He's really hung up on the pizza cutter.
[11:24.490 --> 11:26.770]  Yeah, well, it's part of, you know, cutting a pizza.
[11:29.270 --> 11:30.710]  It worked fine.
[11:31.550 --> 11:32.830]  Geoff, you want a little slice?
[11:32.930 --> 11:33.810]  Yeah, baby, of course.
[11:34.390 --> 11:36.150]  The only one I don't want is Gavin's.
[11:36.370 --> 11:37.130]  Oh, come on now.
[11:37.230 --> 11:37.930]  No, I'm going to have some.
[11:39.510 --> 11:39.870]  Gavin?
[11:40.090 --> 11:41.650]  Do we, like, all eat at the same time?
[11:41.690 --> 11:42.050]  Yeah.
[11:42.790 --> 11:43.330]  Well, I'll wait.
[11:45.430 --> 11:46.150]  I'm starving.
[11:48.030 --> 11:49.890]  Gavin, do you think that this...
[11:49.890 --> 11:51.550]  Do you think your pizza is going to taste better
[11:51.550 --> 11:52.570]  than the condiment you made?
[11:52.830 --> 11:54.430]  If we're going to compare previous creations.
[11:55.490 --> 11:57.470]  Let's not bring up condiments while we're all in person.
[11:57.890 --> 11:59.130]  Alright, let's give it a try.
[12:06.090 --> 12:06.690]  Pepperoni pizza.
[12:08.190 --> 12:08.950]  There's cheese.
[12:09.510 --> 12:10.310]  There's pepperoni.
[12:11.150 --> 12:11.870]  There's dough.
[12:12.550 --> 12:13.410]  I can taste the dough.
[12:13.410 --> 12:14.310]  How's the stuffed crust?
[12:14.450 --> 12:15.370]  The dough flavor's there.
[12:16.270 --> 12:18.390]  Stuffed crust is good. This is a good pizza.
[12:19.990 --> 12:21.050]  That looks like a great pizza.
[12:21.510 --> 12:24.050]  I think if we learn how to control the temperature
[12:24.050 --> 12:26.070]  and then learn what temperature we need to cook at,
[12:26.070 --> 12:27.690]  we can really dial that in.
[12:30.150 --> 12:31.250]  Should we try that one?
[12:32.130 --> 12:32.490]  Absolutely.
[12:33.570 --> 12:34.150]  I'll cut it up.
[12:35.930 --> 12:37.430]  If only I had a pizza cutter, right?
[12:38.810 --> 12:39.890]  He's saying it like that,
[12:39.990 --> 12:42.090]  but now he has to cut the pizza, so I guess we'll wait and see.
[12:42.850 --> 12:43.830]  So for those listening,
[12:43.970 --> 12:45.890]  moving on to Geoff's pepperoni.
[12:47.210 --> 12:49.670]  You really should be watching this, but...
[12:49.670 --> 12:50.990]  This video is on YouTube as well,
[12:51.050 --> 12:52.070]  so you can see...
[12:52.670 --> 12:53.630]  There's also a video
[12:53.630 --> 12:55.750]  of the process
[12:55.750 --> 12:57.090]  of the pizza being made.
[12:57.250 --> 12:58.130]  Or maybe it's just one video.
[12:58.730 --> 13:00.710]  Gavin said, please, only make me make one video.
[13:01.650 --> 13:03.470]  Well, I'm not making this bit, so it's fine, right?
[13:06.850 --> 13:07.770]  Who's making this bit?
[13:07.930 --> 13:09.050]  This is audio.
[13:14.050 --> 13:15.630]  Andrew, I'm kind of bummed that you're not here
[13:15.630 --> 13:16.510]  to eat the pizza with us.
[13:17.810 --> 13:19.210]  Yeah, honestly, seeing
[13:19.210 --> 13:21.490]  both of your pizzas made me realize
[13:21.490 --> 13:23.670]  that my pizza is barely pizza at all.
[13:23.810 --> 13:25.690]  It reduced... I was feeling good about my pizza
[13:25.690 --> 13:27.770]  until I looked at yours and Geoff's.
[13:27.830 --> 13:29.030]  I was feeling good about my pizza
[13:29.030 --> 13:29.830]  until I looked at mine.
[13:30.430 --> 13:32.290]  I would never feel good about what you made.
[13:32.770 --> 13:33.350]  That's on you.
[13:33.770 --> 13:35.350]  Geoff got that big slice.
[13:36.110 --> 13:37.750]  I deserve it.
[13:38.610 --> 13:39.590]  You cooked them.
[13:39.770 --> 13:40.490]  We tuck it into this one?
[13:40.590 --> 13:41.770]  Yeah, let's tuck it in.
[13:46.030 --> 13:46.430]  Oh!
[13:48.490 --> 13:49.170]  Oh, baby!
[13:56.180 --> 13:59.040]  Emily went, mmm, and then threw it down.
[13:59.900 --> 14:02.860]  That is a bog-standard
[14:02.860 --> 14:05.040]  pepperoni pizza. Thin-crust pepperoni pizza.
[14:05.400 --> 14:06.620]  That same sort of doughy feel.
[14:08.640 --> 14:10.280]  I'm going to suffer some of the same issues
[14:10.280 --> 14:12.440]  with not knowing what temperature to cook a pizza at.
[14:12.680 --> 14:14.780]  I think this tastes like pizza
[14:14.780 --> 14:16.560]  you would get at Blazertag.
[14:18.200 --> 14:19.120]  In a good way.
[14:20.280 --> 14:20.800]  Yeah.
[14:22.260 --> 14:23.180]  Yeah, good way.
[14:23.900 --> 14:25.180]  Sometimes that's the pizza you like.
[14:25.580 --> 14:26.600]  A cafeteria pizza.
[14:28.160 --> 14:29.400]  It is like tombstone.
[14:30.660 --> 14:31.480]  I would eat that.
[14:32.600 --> 14:33.600]  You're eating it right now.
[14:37.740 --> 14:38.780]  And finally...
[14:38.780 --> 14:40.360]  Oh, God!
[14:40.620 --> 14:42.800]  This is going to be so gushy, I think.
[14:43.500 --> 14:43.940]  Yes.
[14:48.040 --> 14:49.340]  Pallet cleanser for later.
[14:51.240 --> 14:53.520]  Okay, who wants the onion side
[14:53.520 --> 14:55.340]  and who wants the regular Branson side?
[14:55.780 --> 14:56.060]  I'm good.
[14:56.800 --> 14:59.180]  Nick is so into this.
[14:59.660 --> 15:00.480]  Oh, God.
[15:01.160 --> 15:01.860]  Now I'm scared.
[15:02.600 --> 15:05.440]  Nick is, like, ready to try anything
[15:05.440 --> 15:07.660]  and also go, ooh, it's good.
[15:08.980 --> 15:10.120]  That's so much cut...
[15:10.120 --> 15:11.220]  What are you... Oh, my God.
[15:13.420 --> 15:14.300]  Oh, God.
[15:14.300 --> 15:15.160]  The impression I get from Nick
[15:15.160 --> 15:17.000]  in these moments is that Nick
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.320]  really likes being alive.
[15:18.680 --> 15:19.040]  Oh, yeah.
[15:19.700 --> 15:21.680]  Really, you're just, like, into life.
[15:21.780 --> 15:23.000]  You're like, I'm just going to do it all.
[15:23.320 --> 15:26.420]  I think Nick is a guy who really watches
[15:26.420 --> 15:28.460]  what he eats around the house
[15:28.460 --> 15:29.840]  and does a good job about it,
[15:29.940 --> 15:32.500]  so when it's time for face jam
[15:32.500 --> 15:34.400]  or face to do a pizza day,
[15:34.700 --> 15:36.240]  he goes, all right!
[15:37.040 --> 15:38.240]  And that's it.
[15:38.240 --> 15:39.080]  Hang on.
[15:39.760 --> 15:40.940]  What happened here?
[15:42.560 --> 15:48.340]  Oh, I got a big-ass chunk of egg.
[15:48.480 --> 15:48.800]  Thank you.
[15:49.440 --> 15:51.960]  Here's my initial assessment before biting into it.
[15:52.120 --> 15:53.400]  It stinks.
[15:55.040 --> 15:56.220]  There is an odor.
[15:56.620 --> 15:58.260]  When I was holding the laptop earlier,
[15:58.420 --> 16:00.360]  there was a distinct odor.
[16:00.700 --> 16:02.180]  Yeah, a stink odor.
[16:02.260 --> 16:03.800]  You're right. 100%.
[16:03.800 --> 16:05.520]  Down the hatch?
[16:06.180 --> 16:06.540]  Yeah.
[16:06.780 --> 16:07.940]  I'm going to go get a drink.
[16:09.100 --> 16:10.160]  Yeah, absolutely, man.
[16:11.800 --> 16:13.160]  I got Diet Coke and Diet Coke.
[16:13.160 --> 16:13.720]  Hey, can I have one?
[16:16.260 --> 16:17.740]  Is this, like, an onion odor?
[16:17.800 --> 16:19.460]  Like, what is the scent, would you say?
[16:19.480 --> 16:21.200]  Well, I think part of it is
[16:21.200 --> 16:23.840]  it's pickled and it's chutneyed
[16:23.840 --> 16:25.400]  and it's oniony,
[16:25.480 --> 16:26.160]  so it's like a
[16:27.100 --> 16:28.300]  vomit-y sweet and sour.
[16:28.460 --> 16:29.600]  Hey, Geoff, you're out of sodas.
[16:31.540 --> 16:32.400]  I got one outside.
[16:33.160 --> 16:34.140]  All right, do we want to
[16:34.140 --> 16:34.900]  all bite at the same time?
[16:37.060 --> 16:38.200]  I'm going to go for the tip
[16:38.200 --> 16:40.020]  and I'm also going to go and grab some crust afterwards.
[16:40.480 --> 16:41.860]  Oh, it's so wet.
[16:42.040 --> 16:42.680]  Okay, here we go.
[16:43.300 --> 16:43.980]  Stop burping!
[16:45.060 --> 16:45.680]  I can't make room.
[16:52.080 --> 16:56.400]  Ooh, that is...
[17:04.060 --> 17:05.880]  You know in, like, a horror movie when, like,
[17:05.940 --> 17:07.940]  in a found footage, like, all the audio cuts
[17:07.940 --> 17:09.800]  out when the worst thing happens? That's what
[17:09.800 --> 17:11.820]  I've experienced. Like, I can just tell this is the
[17:11.820 --> 17:13.920]  worst part of this pizza eating.
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.180]  Did you go crust? Yeah.
[17:15.480 --> 17:16.420]  I don't like it.
[17:19.070 --> 17:20.090]  I don't like it at all.
[17:20.250 --> 17:22.430]  Why would Papa John's make that?
[17:23.710 --> 17:24.730]  I cannot recommend that.
[17:27.390 --> 17:28.810]  Well, you know what, though?
[17:30.630 --> 17:30.990]  What?
[17:31.130 --> 17:32.530]  It's kind of complementary flavors.
[17:32.530 --> 17:33.970]  There's nothing that's sticking.
[17:34.110 --> 17:35.570]  It's all like...
[17:35.570 --> 17:37.730]  As opposed to insultory flavors?
[17:38.750 --> 17:39.730]  I feel insulted.
[17:44.250 --> 17:44.690]  It's...
[17:45.810 --> 17:46.890]  Gavin, it's, like, inedible.
[17:47.130 --> 17:48.250]  I got way more onion that time.
[17:48.370 --> 17:49.070]  The pickled onion.
[17:49.570 --> 17:50.690]  It keeps going!
[17:52.390 --> 17:53.130]  It's pizza day.
[17:54.170 --> 17:55.770]  It's pizza day. He's gotta go.
[17:58.770 --> 18:00.330]  Who knows when I'll have this shot again.
[18:00.330 --> 18:01.670]  Dude, the crust is good.
[18:02.870 --> 18:03.970]  That's good crust.
[18:04.630 --> 18:05.490]  I told you.
[18:06.690 --> 18:07.670]  With the Branst...
[18:08.070 --> 18:10.050]  This is almost edible.
[18:11.590 --> 18:12.490]  No, it's
[18:12.490 --> 18:12.910]  not.
[18:16.050 --> 18:18.330]  These are flavors I don't think I've ever, like,
[18:18.330 --> 18:20.410]  really had. I don't like how Branston pickle
[18:20.410 --> 18:21.230]  can be
[18:22.050 --> 18:24.150]  crunchy and soft at the same time.
[18:27.550 --> 18:27.970]  Ugh.
[18:28.610 --> 18:29.410]  You love it.
[18:29.490 --> 18:30.550]  He's just going to town.
[18:31.810 --> 18:32.470]  Just like
[18:33.070 --> 18:34.390]  his mom used to make.
[18:37.810 --> 18:39.010]  Gavin's looking for paper towels.
[18:39.110 --> 18:40.770]  He's doing a great job. And if you want to bring
[18:40.770 --> 18:43.130]  a few of us some, that might be pretty cool.
[18:44.910 --> 18:46.650]  Oh, thank you. My man.
[18:46.910 --> 18:47.710]  The stuffed crust is good.
[18:48.650 --> 18:50.110]  No! Yeah, it's good.
[18:50.730 --> 18:52.450]  I gotta say, the crust is great.
[18:52.450 --> 18:54.590]  You enjoy the Branston pickle crust?
[18:54.770 --> 18:55.490]  I do, yeah.
[18:56.130 --> 18:56.770]  That works for me.
[18:57.990 --> 18:59.170]  There's a problem in the middle.
[19:00.170 --> 19:01.030]  Here's the deal.
[19:02.550 --> 19:03.650]  I feel like
[19:04.770 --> 19:06.450]  we may have a little bit more
[19:06.450 --> 19:08.410]  of refining work to do, or maybe
[19:08.410 --> 19:10.530]  not. Maybe we just, we can
[19:11.090 --> 19:12.410]  through context clues
[19:12.410 --> 19:13.610]  from making this first one.
[19:14.710 --> 19:18.430]  Hey, we just found out that none of our
[19:18.430 --> 19:19.670]  video was recording.
[19:20.330 --> 19:21.330]  Not any of it?
[19:21.790 --> 19:23.030]  No, I don't think so.
[19:24.150 --> 19:25.450]  I just got that one right now.
[19:26.270 --> 19:27.310]  The audio's good.
[19:28.490 --> 19:29.810]  Oh, I stopped when you
[19:29.810 --> 19:31.450]  served me. I think it...
[19:33.590 --> 19:35.170]  Oh, I think we've got some of it.
[19:35.590 --> 19:37.010]  We've got none of us eating my pizza.
[19:37.350 --> 19:38.070]  Oh, no.
[19:40.490 --> 19:41.410]  Should we film that?
[19:43.690 --> 19:45.350]  It's like two clips. Okay.
[19:46.890 --> 19:47.850]  A pick-up of
[19:47.850 --> 19:48.710]  eating my pizza.
[19:50.650 --> 19:51.110]  Emily's
[19:51.810 --> 19:52.990]  just like me.
[19:53.430 --> 19:54.850]  We're both professional film people.
[19:54.850 --> 19:55.630]  Hey, you want to eat some of mine?
[19:58.270 --> 19:59.210]  Oh, yeah, we need footage of that.
[20:01.110 --> 20:01.870]  Let's explain.
[20:02.290 --> 20:03.250]  Eric loves an intro.
[20:03.610 --> 20:05.550]  Let's explain what happened. There was a problem
[20:05.550 --> 20:07.710]  with the filming, and we lost
[20:07.710 --> 20:09.310]  all of us eating Gavin's
[20:09.850 --> 20:10.530]  disgusting pizza.
[20:11.750 --> 20:12.650]  Let's eat it again.
[20:13.390 --> 20:15.570]  Now I will say, lost is a strong word
[20:15.570 --> 20:17.730]  when we never had it to begin with.
[20:18.510 --> 20:19.510]  Lost implies
[20:19.510 --> 20:21.570]  it was something we had, and we got.
[20:21.870 --> 20:23.170]  Yeah, get that egg on there.
[20:25.090 --> 20:27.650]  I would say get that bite and then get the crust
[20:27.650 --> 20:28.010]  as well.
[20:32.250 --> 20:33.130]  Come on!
[20:33.770 --> 20:34.790]  It's not that bad.
[20:36.730 --> 20:37.650]  I like 18
[20:37.650 --> 20:39.270]  flavors I've never had all at once.
[20:41.450 --> 20:42.470]  Oh, yes.
[20:43.590 --> 20:44.010]  Yes!
[20:45.330 --> 20:47.130]  Nick's a fucking freak for this shit.
[20:47.310 --> 20:50.610]  Oh, yeah, Eric, get the bite in the front with the egg.
[20:52.510 --> 20:53.650]  It's why... listen.
[20:54.970 --> 20:56.310]  Oh, I didn't get that flavor at first.
[20:59.010 --> 21:00.550]  Honestly, every bite I've had of it
[21:00.550 --> 21:01.430]  is completely different.
[21:03.810 --> 21:05.570]  I really might be sick.
[21:06.050 --> 21:07.850]  Every bite is a snowflake, Eric.
[21:08.390 --> 21:09.930]  Why'd you do this? On purpose.
[21:10.710 --> 21:12.490]  Oh, maybe you should get it on camera too.
[21:12.670 --> 21:14.450]  Oh! Emily should have some!
[21:15.770 --> 21:18.090]  Mine would be good because it doesn't have egg in it.
[21:18.190 --> 21:20.390]  Yeah, the egg is the problem.
[21:21.830 --> 21:23.230]  I mean, I got a little piece of egg for you if you want.
[21:23.250 --> 21:24.870]  No, no, no. I don't like eggs.
[21:24.890 --> 21:27.490]  It's pretty crispy from about 18 minutes of boiling.
[21:33.950 --> 21:36.570]  This is like sweet onion and pizza sauce.
[21:36.690 --> 21:37.590]  You got some...
[21:37.590 --> 21:37.770]  Henry!
[21:38.970 --> 21:40.110]  I have a drinking problem.
[21:41.990 --> 21:43.790]  So you like the plowman's pizza.
[21:43.910 --> 21:44.790]  Yeah, do you want to get some crust?
[21:44.970 --> 21:46.910]  Yeah, I think I've heard the crust is the best part.
[21:48.570 --> 21:49.670]  I hope you don't get the bite
[21:49.670 --> 21:50.730]  that Nick did a second ago.
[21:50.790 --> 21:51.630]  It's the char.
[21:54.010 --> 21:55.270]  And get the front. Get the egg.
[21:55.670 --> 21:56.330]  Go, go, go!
[21:56.850 --> 21:57.630]  Eric, get the egg!
[21:58.090 --> 21:59.290]  Egg! Egg! Egg!
[22:01.230 --> 22:02.250]  It's old food, Eric.
[22:02.250 --> 22:02.570]  Egg!
[22:08.470 --> 22:10.550]  He literally almost threw up down the pizza.
[22:12.150 --> 22:13.990]  So if you're just watching the video,
[22:15.230 --> 22:16.270]  if you're just watching the video,
[22:16.550 --> 22:18.690]  we do have audio of all of the
[22:18.690 --> 22:19.910]  original bite-eatings.
[22:19.990 --> 22:21.850]  So go back and listen to that. It's the full picture.
[22:22.850 --> 22:24.430]  Eric, are you really not going to go for the egg bite?
[22:24.590 --> 22:25.570]  I really don't know whether I can.
[22:26.250 --> 22:27.070]  I think you can.
[22:27.610 --> 22:29.090]  It's like egg chutney.
[22:29.090 --> 22:30.330]  You got it. You got it. Come on, man.
[22:30.830 --> 22:33.050]  What are you doing?
[22:34.090 --> 22:35.010]  How do you know?
[22:35.150 --> 22:36.470]  Just remember, it's old food.
[22:36.830 --> 22:37.490]  You like eggs.
[22:37.670 --> 22:39.850]  You like pizza.
[22:40.730 --> 22:41.810]  You probably like chutney.
[22:41.910 --> 22:43.070]  You bought all these ingredients.
[22:43.330 --> 22:45.810]  I think looking at it is making it worse.
[22:45.930 --> 22:48.870]  Don't look at it. Just close your eyes and go to town.
[22:51.110 --> 22:52.530]  Oh, it dripped on all the wires.
[22:53.730 --> 22:54.730]  Pick a lily drop.
[22:54.890 --> 22:55.690]  That's a Nick problem.
[22:56.450 --> 22:57.930]  Eric carries this. This is his problem.
[22:59.550 --> 23:01.730]  Go on, my son. It's making it worse.
[23:02.750 --> 23:03.630]  Down the hatch.
[23:04.690 --> 23:05.430]  Got this.
[23:05.710 --> 23:07.270]  Big boy. Brave boy. Big brave boy.
[23:08.410 --> 23:09.950]  Look how strong you are.
[23:10.050 --> 23:11.530]  Look at those strong fingers.
[23:11.790 --> 23:13.770]  Look how brave you are.
[23:14.270 --> 23:15.350]  Big, strong, brave guy.
[23:17.790 --> 23:19.410]  What would Fernando Tatis do?
[23:21.250 --> 23:21.730]  Steroids.
[23:21.990 --> 23:22.250]  Yeah.
[23:25.690 --> 23:27.130]  It just tastes like egg.
[23:28.430 --> 23:28.870]  Yum.
[23:30.390 --> 23:31.450]  Everybody likes eggs.
[23:38.010 --> 23:39.930]  It's like when I try to tell my kid something is good.
[23:40.350 --> 23:41.030]  I like it.
[23:46.750 --> 23:48.370]  That's the face the lady made
[23:48.370 --> 23:49.750]  when I proposed to Emily in front of her.
[23:51.970 --> 23:52.410]  Yeah.
[23:53.350 --> 23:53.790]  Yeah.
[23:54.510 --> 23:55.490]  I told them,
[23:55.510 --> 23:57.650]  you haven't heard it, but I told them that nobody
[23:57.650 --> 23:59.330]  there was into us getting married.
[23:59.330 --> 23:59.630]  No.
[23:59.910 --> 24:03.710]  It was fun when we have this major life moment and get back on a tour
[24:04.410 --> 24:05.770]  and just sit there.
[24:06.270 --> 24:07.670]  Just like no one gives a shit.
[24:07.830 --> 24:09.030]  Congratulations, by the way.
[24:11.130 --> 24:11.610]  This fucking
[24:11.610 --> 24:12.870]  sucks. Wow.
[24:13.770 --> 24:15.910]  I mean, it definitely wasn't good, but I would...
[24:15.910 --> 24:17.210]  I mean, I ate most of my...
[24:17.210 --> 24:19.390]  Right! These are all flavors that you know.
[24:21.910 --> 24:23.630]  I've never had that kind of pickled onion
[24:23.630 --> 24:25.210]  or that chutney, but...
[24:26.050 --> 24:27.170]  Is it the worst pizza
[24:27.170 --> 24:27.910]  you've ever had, Eric?
[24:30.410 --> 24:30.850]  Yeah.
[24:31.490 --> 24:32.870]  I mean, like legitimately,
[24:33.450 --> 24:34.370]  like legitimately,
[24:35.130 --> 24:37.310]  I'm trying to think of a pizza I've had that's worse.
[24:39.150 --> 24:40.570]  And there's never been a pizza
[24:41.130 --> 24:43.150]  that almost made me throw up while
[24:43.150 --> 24:43.930]  taking a bite.
[24:43.930 --> 24:45.370]  Like, you've never been...
[24:45.370 --> 24:48.210]  You've never eaten a piece of pizza before that turned you off of pizza.
[24:48.470 --> 24:48.870]  Yeah.
[24:49.250 --> 24:52.190]  I mean, I'm eating a different pizza to get the flavor of this pizza
[24:52.190 --> 24:52.630]  out of my mouth.
[24:52.950 --> 24:55.870]  Watching you move that pizza closer to your mouth and then you gagging
[24:55.870 --> 24:56.370]  and burping.
[24:57.210 --> 24:59.050]  Vile! Vile! Vile!
[24:59.970 --> 25:00.850]  I hate it.
[25:02.070 --> 25:03.230]  Okay, so I think rates...
[25:03.230 --> 25:03.750]  Like, scoring.
[25:05.970 --> 25:07.710]  What would we rate Eric's one?
[25:08.330 --> 25:09.750]  Yeah, what would you rate my tiny pizza?
[25:09.870 --> 25:12.190]  I'd give your tiny pizza an 8.75.
[25:12.190 --> 25:14.250]  Okay. Gavin?
[25:14.530 --> 25:15.830]  Uh, probably 6.5.
[25:16.170 --> 25:16.870]  6.5.
[25:18.710 --> 25:19.670]  That's insane!
[25:20.650 --> 25:22.310]  Andrew, I can't wait
[25:22.310 --> 25:24.370]  for Gavin to rate his own pizza.
[25:24.590 --> 25:26.250]  Let's be fair, it was a very simple pizza.
[25:26.570 --> 25:28.350]  It wasn't very adventurous, so you're losing marks there.
[25:28.730 --> 25:30.290]  I don't want adventure when
[25:30.290 --> 25:32.610]  I eat a pizza. I just want it to taste good.
[25:32.710 --> 25:34.470]  Oh! Hey, we have a special
[25:34.470 --> 25:35.430]  guest who just walked in.
[25:37.030 --> 25:38.070]  Oh, she won't.
[25:38.950 --> 25:40.390]  My small wife is here.
[25:41.850 --> 25:42.370]  Um...
[25:42.370 --> 25:43.950]  Eric made a small pizza for you.
[25:43.970 --> 25:46.310]  Okay, so here's the thing. This is regular
[25:46.310 --> 25:47.910]  small pepperoni pizza stuff crust.
[25:48.330 --> 25:50.470]  Totally fine. No, no. It's 100% regular.
[25:50.610 --> 25:52.190]  It's normal. It is regular pizza.
[25:52.770 --> 25:54.490]  Then Geoff made a pepperoni that was also
[25:54.490 --> 25:54.770]  normal.
[25:56.750 --> 25:57.990]  Gavin made a pizza
[25:58.830 --> 25:59.870]  with chutney
[26:00.530 --> 26:02.050]  and hard-boiled eggs.
[26:02.830 --> 26:03.510]  And ham.
[26:04.810 --> 26:05.850]  Pickled onions.
[26:06.890 --> 26:07.670]  Branston pickle.
[26:07.670 --> 26:09.010]  Pick a lily.
[26:09.330 --> 26:10.250]  Or was it for the bit?
[26:11.570 --> 26:14.110]  Yeah, it's still... well...
[26:14.110 --> 26:14.970]  It was for the bit.
[26:16.190 --> 26:17.650]  Gavin rated my pizza
[26:17.650 --> 26:19.010]  a 6.5.
[26:20.970 --> 26:22.150]  I'd give my pizza
[26:22.150 --> 26:23.790]  at least a 7.
[26:24.190 --> 26:24.830]  It is a...
[26:25.610 --> 26:27.750]  It's a solid pep. It's just, you know...
[26:27.750 --> 26:28.890]  8.75.
[26:29.110 --> 26:30.870]  Then how about Geoff's pizza?
[26:32.390 --> 26:33.530]  Geoff's was a bit more
[26:33.530 --> 26:35.750]  doughy and cold, so I'd say 6.
[26:35.750 --> 26:37.330]  I'd give mine a 7.9.
[26:37.610 --> 26:39.630]  I'd give yours a 7.
[26:39.770 --> 26:41.590]  I think it's a pepperoni pizza.
[26:41.870 --> 26:43.390]  Nick, what's your score on both of those?
[26:43.630 --> 26:45.290]  7 on the little one, 8 on the...
[26:45.290 --> 26:47.910]  And now it's time for Gavin's pizza.
[26:48.490 --> 26:49.570]  Well, it's a 2, isn't it?
[26:49.610 --> 26:50.110]  Let's be fair.
[26:51.010 --> 26:51.890]  It's not good.
[26:53.670 --> 26:56.190]  But the flavors, I think...
[26:56.190 --> 26:57.570]  Every bite was different.
[26:59.230 --> 26:59.730]  It's the
[26:59.730 --> 27:00.430]  English cheddar.
[27:02.650 --> 27:03.570]  The cheese
[27:03.570 --> 27:05.190]  is so strong.
[27:05.330 --> 27:05.850]  It's very strong.
[27:06.370 --> 27:09.590]  But then everything stands up to the strong cheese.
[27:10.050 --> 27:11.290]  So it's just a fight.
[27:11.490 --> 27:13.650]  The cheese basically stands up in the middle
[27:13.650 --> 27:15.650]  of the field, fronting on whoever...
[27:15.650 --> 27:16.950]  And then the branch of pickles is like,
[27:17.130 --> 27:18.490]  I'll match you, you son.
[27:18.730 --> 27:20.690]  And then everyone else just squares up to it,
[27:20.750 --> 27:22.130]  and all the flavors match.
[27:22.250 --> 27:24.370]  Except for the pickle onion, I couldn't get on board with that.
[27:26.350 --> 27:27.150]  It's absolutely...
[27:27.150 --> 27:28.250]  I mean, 2 I think is...
[27:28.250 --> 27:30.070]  I guess I'll give it a 1.
[27:30.070 --> 27:31.810]  If it was cooked better
[27:31.810 --> 27:33.450]  and not burned, I could have eaten the whole thing.
[27:33.750 --> 27:35.590]  It's a 10 on originality.
[27:35.950 --> 27:37.510]  It's a 10 on creativity.
[27:37.770 --> 27:39.890]  It's a negative 200 on every
[27:39.890 --> 27:41.410]  other thing there.
[27:41.630 --> 27:42.570]  So your rating is?
[27:43.830 --> 27:44.710]  2.7.
[27:45.410 --> 27:46.310]  Higher than mine?
[27:48.490 --> 27:49.530]  I'd give it a 3.
[27:49.990 --> 27:50.530]  Thanks, Nick.
[27:51.370 --> 27:52.290]  Thanks, I appreciate that.
[27:53.390 --> 27:54.370]  Emily, what do you think?
[27:55.730 --> 27:56.910]  Well, that's not a number.
[27:58.030 --> 27:59.070]  I think...
[27:59.790 --> 28:00.310]  2?
[28:00.830 --> 28:02.270]  Okay, 2. Appreciate it.
[28:02.330 --> 28:03.270]  I don't think it's a pizza.
[28:04.350 --> 28:05.710]  I mean, it looks like a pizza.
[28:06.030 --> 28:08.930]  I feel like it's a chutney on bread.
[28:09.670 --> 28:11.190]  Like, that's just an appetizer.
[28:11.370 --> 28:12.850]  Barbara, just based on the
[28:13.470 --> 28:13.990]  look...
[28:13.990 --> 28:16.150]  Do you hate yourself?
[28:16.750 --> 28:18.110]  Um, yeah.
[28:19.730 --> 28:20.950]  But not as much as how
[28:20.950 --> 28:21.630]  that turned out.
[28:24.380 --> 28:24.900]  2.
[28:24.900 --> 28:25.560]  2.
[28:26.460 --> 28:27.760]  And what was your rank?
[28:28.000 --> 28:28.380]  1.
[28:29.060 --> 28:30.800]  We should call it the Plowman's 2.
[28:32.120 --> 28:34.140]  I will change my score to 2 for that.
[28:34.500 --> 28:34.920]  Absolutely.
[28:35.680 --> 28:37.980]  That's what's gonna be the recipe. The Plowman's number 2.
[28:38.180 --> 28:38.980]  Oh, man.
[28:39.660 --> 28:41.800]  Yeah, I think I would probably do it again without
[28:41.800 --> 28:44.400]  the pickled onion, and without the piccadilly.
[28:44.560 --> 28:45.540]  Okay, so hang on.
[28:46.120 --> 28:47.100]  Shut the fuck up.
[28:47.180 --> 28:48.600]  What are you talking about?
[28:48.920 --> 28:51.500]  The Branson pickle was the whole point.
[28:51.500 --> 28:53.900]  No, pickled onion is different than Branson pickle.
[28:53.960 --> 28:55.740]  Even though Branson pickle is pickled onion.
[28:55.800 --> 28:56.440]  I'm talking about the pickled onion in the jar.
[28:56.840 --> 28:58.100]  The yellow stuff.
[28:58.940 --> 29:00.620]  He had two different kinds of pickled onion.
[29:00.880 --> 29:01.940]  He liked one.
[29:02.060 --> 29:04.820]  You didn't have any of that, because I only did that on half the pizza.
[29:05.540 --> 29:07.820]  You had the best version of that pizza.
[29:08.540 --> 29:09.840]  The one bite with the egg
[29:09.840 --> 29:11.080]  just tasted like egg,
[29:11.320 --> 29:13.180]  but it was so wet and firm.
[29:13.580 --> 29:15.320]  The cheese was so strong.
[29:15.360 --> 29:16.520]  Oh, but the crust was phenomenal.
[29:16.760 --> 29:19.040]  You had the side of the pizza that he's on board with.
[29:19.040 --> 29:19.220]  Yeah.
[29:21.840 --> 29:23.380]  Yeah, if I made it again,
[29:23.540 --> 29:25.160]  no piccadilly, none of that yellow
[29:25.160 --> 29:27.460]  floppy pickle, and the rest was phenomenal.
[29:28.660 --> 29:29.060]  Phenomenal?
[29:29.440 --> 29:31.040]  But it just needed to be cooked.
[29:31.280 --> 29:32.580]  It needed to be not raw and hot.
[29:33.440 --> 29:35.720]  It was hot floppy bread with burnt bits.
[29:35.840 --> 29:37.000]  It like gave me a headache.
[29:37.420 --> 29:38.840]  I don't feel good.
[29:38.900 --> 29:39.840]  That's all the carcinogens.
[29:40.060 --> 29:41.960]  I feel bad.
[29:42.460 --> 29:45.900]  We didn't even talk about when that chunk of wood fell on Gavin's pizza.
[29:46.060 --> 29:48.260]  We had to separate it from the pizza.
[29:48.260 --> 29:49.580]  You dropped wood on my pizza?
[29:50.360 --> 29:51.420]  Just like that.
[29:51.720 --> 29:52.840]  Big ass hunk of charcoal.
[30:00.870 --> 30:01.310]  Um...
[30:01.310 --> 30:02.510]  Okay, so it wasn't a win.
[30:06.940 --> 30:08.540]  But I've learned a lot.
[30:09.060 --> 30:10.180]  Oh yeah? Yeah.
[30:10.360 --> 30:12.220]  You gotta start somewhere.
[30:13.140 --> 30:15.300]  Andrew, how would you rate all these from looks? Did you do that already?
[30:15.920 --> 30:17.660]  Uh, yeah, from looks, I would say that
[30:17.660 --> 30:20.060]  Gavin, yours was a one.
[30:20.760 --> 30:21.900]  Actually, I maybe
[30:21.900 --> 30:24.120]  I don't know if I could imagine a pizza that
[30:24.120 --> 30:26.160]  looked worse, to be honest. It's tough to
[30:26.160 --> 30:27.860]  scale. At least it was a slow.
[30:28.320 --> 30:30.220]  But I can't imagine a worse looking one.
[30:30.220 --> 30:32.240]  Here's the thing, Gavin, your pizza
[30:32.240 --> 30:34.120]  looked like if
[30:34.120 --> 30:36.000]  a children's TV show was
[30:36.000 --> 30:37.880]  trying to show a disgusting pizza,
[30:38.360 --> 30:40.200]  it would have cut up hard-boiled
[30:40.200 --> 30:41.860]  eggs and chutney.
[30:42.260 --> 30:43.840]  Like, it would have those things and it would
[30:43.840 --> 30:46.120]  it would be somebody pulling like the lid
[30:46.120 --> 30:47.720]  off the pizza and the camera would go
[30:47.720 --> 30:48.420]  BOOM!
[30:50.320 --> 30:51.920]  If Nickelodeon made Fear Factor,
[30:52.260 --> 30:53.320]  that would be a challenge.
[30:53.600 --> 30:55.760]  It looks like your pizza is something
[30:55.760 --> 30:57.020]  Mark Summers made kids
[30:58.060 --> 30:58.940]  put together
[31:00.340 --> 31:02.040]  to avoid the slime.
[31:02.200 --> 31:03.440]  And they're eating, oh, this is
[31:03.440 --> 31:04.820]  wild. This is awful.
[31:05.580 --> 31:07.780]  Hey, how would you rate Geoff's pizza
[31:07.780 --> 31:08.520]  just based on looks?
[31:09.180 --> 31:11.880]  Yeah, I'd say yours and Geoff's have to be a seven.
[31:12.200 --> 31:13.820]  Just as a minimum. Like, it seemed like it was
[31:13.820 --> 31:15.860]  cooked, it's pepperoni, there's nothing too fancy
[31:15.860 --> 31:17.860]  about it. It seems like kind of a basic dough.
[31:18.000 --> 31:19.780]  Like, it's fine. It's solid. It's a solid pizza.
[31:19.940 --> 31:21.800]  I will say, I think we made those just
[31:21.800 --> 31:22.980]  to have something to eat.
[31:24.540 --> 31:24.980]  Yeah.
[31:26.280 --> 31:27.360]  That's how it feels.
[31:27.600 --> 31:29.760]  The real star of the show was Gavin's
[31:29.760 --> 31:30.600]  Plowman's number two.
[31:31.720 --> 31:33.160]  What a star it was.
[31:33.380 --> 31:35.440]  You ever seen a star fall that fast?
[31:37.740 --> 31:38.840]  It was a real crash and burn.
[31:40.540 --> 31:41.420]  So, um...
[31:41.420 --> 31:42.280]  Proud of you.
[31:43.260 --> 31:44.520]  I'm proud of all of us.
[31:44.940 --> 31:46.460]  We all made a pizza today.
[31:46.520 --> 31:48.620]  That's awesome. Geoff's one
[31:48.620 --> 31:50.220]  and only time using that pizza oven.
[31:50.540 --> 31:51.020]  So far.
[31:52.020 --> 31:53.820]  Are you open to using it more?
[31:54.480 --> 31:56.200]  Well, we were talking about it today, Andrew.
[31:56.580 --> 31:58.360]  It's barely been four years that
[31:58.360 --> 32:00.240]  I've lived here. And we finally
[32:00.240 --> 32:02.380]  broke the seal. So, any day now.
[32:02.560 --> 32:04.360]  It's barely been four
[32:04.360 --> 32:06.240]  years getting around to
[32:06.240 --> 32:08.020]  use that big thing in my
[32:08.020 --> 32:09.940]  backyard that takes up so much space.
[32:09.940 --> 32:11.920]  Is anyone having like a bubbly feeling
[32:11.920 --> 32:14.020]  in their tummy? No, because I only ate
[32:14.020 --> 32:15.120]  like two bites of that.
[32:16.240 --> 32:17.960]  Bubbly feeling. Yeah, just like a little bit
[32:17.960 --> 32:19.660]  of a unsettled
[32:20.680 --> 32:21.880]  sort of raw egg.
[32:22.220 --> 32:22.440]  Sort of.
[32:23.480 --> 32:25.740]  Well, I guess we should wrap up our pizza day.
[32:27.060 --> 32:28.520]  I keep smelling it.
[32:28.620 --> 32:29.680]  Yeah, it's not a good smell.
[32:30.000 --> 32:31.300]  It's not a good smell.
[32:31.360 --> 32:32.380]  It just stinks.
[32:32.720 --> 32:34.000]  It stinks.
[32:36.420 --> 32:38.160]  If you half all the ingredients,
[32:38.160 --> 32:39.940]  can you tell us what the pizza stinks of?
[32:41.080 --> 32:42.060]  Onion. It's a sweet
[32:42.060 --> 32:43.520]  onion smell, mostly.
[32:44.320 --> 32:46.080]  It's the Vidalia onion. That's the thing I'm
[32:46.080 --> 32:47.600]  taking out, so that's fine. But then,
[32:48.160 --> 32:50.100]  egg. But then just
[32:50.100 --> 32:51.560]  simply, egg.
[32:52.360 --> 32:54.020]  Like, it's so sweet
[32:54.020 --> 32:55.940]  and then it smells like an
[32:55.940 --> 32:57.780]  egg. Think about
[32:57.780 --> 33:00.080]  this, Gavin. I used seven
[33:00.080 --> 33:01.900]  months expired dough and
[33:01.900 --> 33:04.220]  cooked it in a waffle iron and I would have scored
[33:04.220 --> 33:05.120]  higher than that. Oh, absolutely.
[33:05.120 --> 33:07.380]  Andrew, Andrew, just based on looks
[33:07.380 --> 33:08.880]  for yours, a hundred percent.
[33:09.240 --> 33:10.940]  Your tiny little cute
[33:10.940 --> 33:12.960]  handheld pizza. Your bagel bite is adorable.
[33:13.120 --> 33:14.760]  Those are adorable. Good work.
[33:15.140 --> 33:16.580]  Good work. I wanna
[33:17.020 --> 33:18.960]  sell stuffy versions of it to kids.
[33:19.520 --> 33:21.220]  You can sleep with your little bagel bite
[33:21.220 --> 33:22.600]  pizza puff.
[33:23.140 --> 33:25.140]  Okay, we should wrap up our pizza day
[33:25.140 --> 33:27.220]  so Gavin can go, I mean, have a
[33:27.220 --> 33:29.260]  bubbly tummy. I'm gonna go and have an afternoon.
[33:33.640 --> 33:34.360]  Really something.
[33:35.940 --> 33:36.700]  If you wanna
[33:36.700 --> 33:38.040]  watch this, you can.
[33:38.340 --> 33:40.100]  I mean, we'll have the uninterrupted video
[33:40.100 --> 33:41.720]  except for somebody interrupted it.
[33:42.140 --> 33:44.160]  But it'll just go to like, you know, the logo
[33:44.160 --> 33:45.900]  and then it'll come on back
[33:45.900 --> 33:47.380]  to when we're going
[33:48.080 --> 33:49.960]  and resetting. And there's also a video
[33:49.960 --> 33:52.140]  of us making them. There is. There's a video
[33:52.140 --> 33:54.000]  of us making, it might be at the beginning of this thing
[33:54.000 --> 33:55.600]  but not the audio. I don't know. We'll see.
[33:56.260 --> 33:57.820]  Maybe we'll Pulp Fiction it
[33:57.820 --> 33:59.160]  and who knows where it'll appear. Yeah, it'll
[33:59.720 --> 34:01.280]  be right there in the middle. It's a non-linear piece
[34:01.280 --> 34:01.600]  of video.
[34:03.120 --> 34:04.560]  A successful office day?
[34:05.100 --> 34:06.000]  Oh, it's a great office day. Yeah.
[34:06.900 --> 34:09.340]  Two for two. We're getting a lot done.
[34:09.500 --> 34:11.120]  We watched the monkey movie
[34:11.120 --> 34:13.080]  and now it feels like uncorked.
[34:13.160 --> 34:14.820]  Like we're ready to go. Yeah. Every day.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.260]  Yeah. Thanks for joining us, Andrew.
[34:18.500 --> 34:19.180]  Thank you.
[34:19.840 --> 34:20.600]  For making such
[34:21.260 --> 34:22.820]  incredible pizzas, Eric and Geoff.
[34:22.920 --> 34:24.480]  And for whatever you made, Gavin.
[34:24.940 --> 34:26.380]  I appreciate looking at it.
[34:26.380 --> 34:27.800]  Man, Gavin, catching a lot of heat.
[34:28.140 --> 34:30.020]  The English cheddar is just so much.
[34:32.600 --> 34:33.860]  Gavin's caught all the heat.
[34:34.460 --> 34:36.000]  Gavin's pizza caught on fire.
[34:36.480 --> 34:37.280]  It caught char.
[34:38.140 --> 34:40.240]  Gavin kept going, I've been sabotaged.
[34:40.820 --> 34:41.720]  I was sabotaged.
[34:42.040 --> 34:44.420]  And then the only part of the pizza that was any good
[34:44.420 --> 34:46.200]  the only part of your pizza that was any good
[34:46.200 --> 34:48.120]  was the crust. I had to bite through the ash
[34:48.120 --> 34:48.980]  to get to the good bit.
[34:50.700 --> 34:52.340]  I thought I knocked
[34:52.340 --> 34:53.100]  most of that off.
[34:53.920 --> 34:55.460]  With the word that you dropped on it?
[34:57.440 --> 34:58.520]  Well, that'll do it.
[34:59.180 --> 35:00.620]  Follow us at Face Jam-
[35:00.620 --> 35:02.600]  Fuck. Sorry.
[35:03.880 --> 35:04.980]  It's a natural habit
[35:04.980 --> 35:06.160]  with this amount of gross food.
[35:06.540 --> 35:08.980]  Honestly, this is how I feel after most
[35:08.980 --> 35:11.040]  Face Jam episodes where you're just like, this is shit.
[35:11.040 --> 35:13.040]  You've got two default intros. One has a gut full of
[35:13.040 --> 35:14.480]  nasty food and you just went to that one.
[35:14.780 --> 35:16.860]  Follow us at F*** Face Pod
[35:16.860 --> 35:18.880]  on Twitter and on Instagram.
[35:19.260 --> 35:21.080]  You can see all the pictures there if you listen
[35:21.080 --> 35:23.100]  to this like a freak. You can go
[35:23.100 --> 35:25.000]  on our YouTube channel and watch the video
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.200]  of it. If you do both, that really
[35:27.200 --> 35:27.880]  helps us out.
[35:29.400 --> 35:31.040]  Can't promise it's going to help you out.
[35:32.840 --> 35:35.260]  So, thank you very much. Any parting words
[35:35.740 --> 35:36.620]  for your pizzas?
[35:36.960 --> 35:39.040]  I just want to say, my last parting word
[35:39.040 --> 35:41.260]  would just be, what a phenomenal job
[35:41.260 --> 35:43.140]  you have taken over doing
[35:43.140 --> 35:44.820]  in season five as the intro-outro guy.
[35:45.140 --> 35:46.400]  And I just really appreciate it.
[35:47.720 --> 35:49.000]  After Andrew's confession
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.040]  that he understands intros now, I'm glad
[35:51.040 --> 35:52.920]  that there's an appeal here.
[35:53.420 --> 35:55.180]  We're trying to reset. We're trying to make it
[35:55.180 --> 35:57.040]  make sense to people who come in on
[35:57.040 --> 35:59.120]  this number episode. So we don't have to
[35:59.120 --> 36:00.660]  go, yeah, go back to 16!
[36:02.980 --> 36:03.780]  Episode 128?
[36:04.300 --> 36:06.880]  Find episode 46 and count backwards
[36:06.880 --> 36:08.380]  until you find the one you're looking for.
[36:11.280 --> 36:12.600]  Any last words, Gavin?
[36:13.460 --> 36:14.120]  I don't think so.
[36:16.460 --> 36:17.200]  Andrew, anything
[36:17.200 --> 36:18.600]  strong to take us out on?
[36:19.220 --> 36:21.340]  No, I'm sad I didn't get to try some seven
[36:21.340 --> 36:22.880]  pizzas, but I'm glad I
[36:22.880 --> 36:25.260]  I'm sort of glad I'm not there, to avoid whatever
[36:25.260 --> 36:26.120]  the fuck Gavin made.
[36:26.920 --> 36:28.400]  The plowman's number two.
[36:28.480 --> 36:30.040]  Yeah, this is to all the plowmen out there.
[36:30.180 --> 36:32.680]  Hey, if you do make your own plowman's number two,
[36:33.740 --> 36:34.460]  please don't.
[36:34.900 --> 36:37.480]  Send us a picture, but also rethink
[36:37.480 --> 36:39.280]  what you're doing. And don't plow in the rain.
[36:40.520 --> 36:41.240]  Yeah, we found
[36:41.240 --> 36:42.720]  that British people don't like wet.
[36:43.340 --> 36:44.880]  Yeah, I don't know why they live there, but alright.
[36:45.400 --> 36:46.980]  Okay, goodbye. Thank you. Bye.
