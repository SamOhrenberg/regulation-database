[00:00.000 --> 00:01.740]  The Roses were living the dream.
[00:01.820 --> 00:02.760]  To you, my darling.
[00:02.840 --> 00:03.600]  No, to you.
[00:03.940 --> 00:05.800]  Until it all came crashing down.
[00:06.300 --> 00:07.080]  You got fired.
[00:07.220 --> 00:07.540]  Fired?
[00:07.880 --> 00:09.100]  On August 29th.
[00:09.140 --> 00:09.480]  Stop.
[00:09.680 --> 00:10.220]  You stop!
[00:10.540 --> 00:15.060]  And see The Roses, where you are, in theaters everywhere, August 29th.
[00:15.480 --> 00:18.560]  I've been using HelloFresh for a while now, and let me tell you,
[00:18.660 --> 00:22.400]  if it was a staple in my kitchen before, it's a must-have nowadays.

[00:38.820 --> 00:41.240]  This is a Rooster Teeth production.
[00:53.290 --> 00:54.470]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[00:55.110 --> 00:58.810]  Are you ready to- should we start year two of F*** Face?
[00:59.210 --> 00:59.410]  Yeah.
[00:59.610 --> 01:01.090]  I guess- I guess this is it, right?
[01:01.130 --> 01:02.010]  This is episode 53?
[01:02.730 --> 01:06.990]  Yeah, but not to be confused with season two, which started a couple of months ago.
[01:07.310 --> 01:10.530]  Yeah, no, season two has been underway for a while. This is year two.
[01:10.910 --> 01:15.530]  That was a joke that actually happened. I think we, like, mentioned it passing starting season two.
[01:15.850 --> 01:16.850]  Have we started the podcast?
[01:17.110 --> 01:17.850]  Yeah, we did. We did.
[01:18.270 --> 01:19.230]  I think it just started.
[01:19.610 --> 01:19.890]  Okay.
[01:20.010 --> 01:22.410]  The podcast has started. I don't think season- year two has started.
[01:22.750 --> 01:27.190]  Okay. I just hit record, so all the- the whatever- if that bit was part of the podcast,
[01:27.390 --> 01:29.370]  I missed it. I did not get that from my perspective.
[01:29.930 --> 01:31.030]  Can I ask you a favor?
[01:31.370 --> 01:31.870]  Yeah, of course.
[01:32.090 --> 01:33.250]  Can you f***ing record?
[01:33.670 --> 01:34.670]  Okay, I am.
[01:34.670 --> 01:37.490]  I feel like you're always the last one to hit record.
[01:37.650 --> 01:37.890]  I am.
[01:37.910 --> 01:41.130]  Yeah, why would you be in here and not recording? I hit record, and then I join.
[01:41.170 --> 01:43.090]  We've been telling jokes in here for 10 minutes,
[01:43.170 --> 01:46.830]  and you never thought to hit record as all the laughter was going on?
[01:47.030 --> 01:49.570]  Well, you left to get a soda. I didn't think that was interesting.
[01:49.790 --> 01:53.270]  Gavin called it a f***ing work meeting, so I don't know why I'm supposed to record.
[01:53.530 --> 01:56.330]  Is it because you won't show up to our pre-talks so you can hear them?
[01:56.510 --> 01:58.450]  Is that why you want to show up to pre-talks?
[01:58.810 --> 02:03.490]  What's the point in pre-talks? If we arrange to talk, if that's all we do at the time,
[02:03.490 --> 02:06.850]  just go then. I don't get it. Why do I have to be early?
[02:07.250 --> 02:10.690]  Gavin, it's just nice to tie. It's nice to catch up a little bit before the show.
[02:10.870 --> 02:11.910]  It's a nice little conversation.
[02:12.330 --> 02:15.670]  Well, start catching up, right? If it's like, hey, we'll record at 12.
[02:16.190 --> 02:18.790]  Catch up at 12, start recording at like 12.10.
[02:19.410 --> 02:19.890]  Why?
[02:20.710 --> 02:21.330]  I can't be early.
[02:21.330 --> 02:22.770]  We're just starting at 12.10.
[02:23.070 --> 02:24.690]  Let me start the show.
[02:25.350 --> 02:30.330]  Hello, and welcome to episode 53 of F*** Face.
[02:30.330 --> 02:35.030]  This is, I don't know, we're well into season two at this point.
[02:35.170 --> 02:37.470]  I think four or five or seven or eight episodes.
[02:37.870 --> 02:40.030]  But now this is the first episode of year two.
[02:41.090 --> 02:42.670]  So this is season three.
[02:43.030 --> 02:47.010]  This is, no, no, no. Season two is, we're still in season two.
[02:48.170 --> 02:50.830]  Episode 53, season two, year two.
[02:51.730 --> 02:53.330]  Although those numbers don't line up.
[02:53.410 --> 02:57.450]  I am Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Gavin Free and Andrew Panton.
[02:57.810 --> 02:58.050]  Hello.
[02:58.330 --> 02:59.990]  How are you fellas doing this week?
[03:00.610 --> 03:04.890]  I'm great. How long was season one and how long is season two so far?
[03:05.250 --> 03:07.570]  Do we know this? How long is the season?
[03:08.010 --> 03:09.310]  Was there a writer's strike this year?
[03:09.970 --> 03:10.570]  I don't know.
[03:10.970 --> 03:16.490]  Year one was 52 episodes. I think season one made it into the 40s.
[03:16.930 --> 03:20.570]  Really? Okay. Are we going to do like the animated TV show thing?
[03:20.710 --> 03:24.270]  Where like the first season is 60 episodes and every other season is like five?
[03:24.450 --> 03:24.790]  Yes.
[03:24.870 --> 03:26.430]  Is there a bad like distributing? Okay.
[03:26.530 --> 03:28.570]  Why does that happen? I feel like that happened with,
[03:28.570 --> 03:31.510]  I feel like I tried to start watching Family Guy,
[03:31.650 --> 03:35.770]  but I couldn't get any like coherency on when any episode was.
[03:35.850 --> 03:37.030]  So I just never watched that show.
[03:37.270 --> 03:40.730]  I don't think you need, I think with a show like Family Guy,
[03:40.850 --> 03:45.090]  you just jump in wherever and it doesn't matter because it's just pop culture jokes.
[03:45.210 --> 03:48.030]  But for organization's sake, I need to, I need an order.
[03:48.270 --> 03:50.870]  I need some sort, I can't just be spewing episodes.
[03:50.990 --> 03:52.610]  How do I know what I've seen and what I haven't?
[03:52.630 --> 03:55.490]  That's why, that's why, I mean, it's an excellent point, Gavin.
[03:55.550 --> 03:57.630]  And that's why we at F*** Face take it so seriously.
[03:57.630 --> 04:01.010]  That's why we have an overall episode count,
[04:01.130 --> 04:03.090]  and then we have it broken down by season,
[04:03.170 --> 04:07.330]  and then further broken down by year, which is different than season.
[04:07.870 --> 04:08.590]  So that there are three...
[04:08.590 --> 04:11.790]  You mean an episode count that isn't written anywhere in the podcast app
[04:11.790 --> 04:13.350]  until like the mid 40s?
[04:13.390 --> 04:16.190]  Which is why we have to break it down into subsections.
[04:16.590 --> 04:20.110]  This is, we are infinitely categorized here at F*** Face
[04:20.110 --> 04:22.830]  to make it as easy as possible for you to enjoy the entertainment.
[04:24.810 --> 04:27.330]  I like when you say at F*** Face.
[04:27.330 --> 04:29.190]  It's a place that we look.
[04:30.490 --> 04:32.450]  At F*** Face World HQ.
[04:32.750 --> 04:34.950]  Well, as part of F*** Face World HQ,
[04:35.110 --> 04:38.450]  I want to open year two of our podcast with an apology.
[04:39.250 --> 04:42.470]  This is deep from the heart, Geoff.
[04:42.550 --> 04:44.870]  This is a very sincere apology to you.
[04:45.250 --> 04:45.630]  To me?
[04:45.870 --> 04:46.590]  I made fun of you, yep.
[04:46.870 --> 04:52.290]  I made fun of you last week for claiming that people didn't know what the DMV was.
[04:52.770 --> 04:56.050]  So I did a poll, did a poll, got people's opinions.
[04:56.730 --> 05:01.370]  I want to apologize for the 5.5% of people who didn't know what the DMV was.
[05:01.490 --> 05:02.370]  Very important number.
[05:03.270 --> 05:06.190]  Very significant 5.5 of the 5,000 votes.
[05:06.190 --> 05:07.930]  I would like, I would also like to point out,
[05:08.130 --> 05:11.150]  because I saw your dipshit little poll where you say,
[05:11.330 --> 05:12.690]  do you know what the DMV is?
[05:12.730 --> 05:13.930]  And a ton of people said yes.
[05:14.050 --> 05:15.450]  And then I went and I read the comments
[05:15.450 --> 05:18.410]  and a whole lot of people thought the DMV meant other shit.
[05:19.010 --> 05:19.670]  Nah, I disagree with that.
[05:19.670 --> 05:21.070]  They're like, yeah, I know what the DMV is.
[05:22.390 --> 05:24.130]  It's the, well, F***, what was it?
[05:24.270 --> 05:24.750]  What was it?
[05:24.750 --> 05:25.930]  Oh, there were so many of them.
[05:25.930 --> 05:27.610]  There were people getting their jokes off.
[05:27.750 --> 05:30.450]  You cannot count the people that were trying to get their jokes off.
[05:30.870 --> 05:33.030]  You cannot put that into your statistics column.
[05:33.490 --> 05:34.390]  There were two types of people.
[05:34.410 --> 05:37.090]  If those people are trying to get jokes off and they're voting, I can.
[05:37.690 --> 05:38.490]  No, there are two.
[05:38.630 --> 05:41.270]  These were the two primary comments, Geoff.
[05:41.630 --> 05:45.810]  The first one was people assuming I thought people didn't know what the DMV is
[05:45.810 --> 05:48.550]  and calling me dumb for it, thinking it was a weird Andrew thing.
[05:48.910 --> 05:50.970]  The second one, the second most common thing,
[05:51.290 --> 05:54.610]  people saying I live in a different country and I know what the DMV is.
[05:54.610 --> 05:56.170]  Everybody knows what the DMV is.
[05:56.910 --> 05:57.730]  But I wanted to apologize.
[05:57.890 --> 05:58.830]  I'm not trying to rub it in your face.
[05:58.930 --> 06:00.250]  5.5% didn't know.
[06:00.290 --> 06:01.910]  It was a very valuable part of your story.
[06:01.930 --> 06:06.130]  I'm telling you, I'm not going to go back and I'm not going to run through all the dumb,
[06:06.250 --> 06:07.230]  all those f***ing messages.
[06:07.350 --> 06:10.450]  But there were a ton of people that thought DMV meant something totally different.
[06:10.570 --> 06:14.710]  And I think, I think that the very premise of the question is false.
[06:15.930 --> 06:17.850]  I, well, how would you have phrased the question?
[06:18.190 --> 06:21.110]  Uh, I don't know because I wasn't, it wasn't my job to phrase the question
[06:21.110 --> 06:22.770]  because I thought it was dumb from that.
[06:22.770 --> 06:25.350]  It could be the department of Mexican voters.
[06:25.550 --> 06:28.550]  It could be the document of macro viruses.
[06:28.550 --> 06:32.030]  It could be the driver motor league, which is totally different.
[06:32.190 --> 06:33.590]  Download music videos.
[06:33.930 --> 06:34.930]  What about that?
[06:35.210 --> 06:38.330]  DC, Maryland and Virginia or Delaware, Maryland and Virginia,
[06:38.410 --> 06:39.870]  which is what most people thought it was.
[06:39.950 --> 06:40.850]  I just saw that.
[06:40.970 --> 06:41.870]  That's a reminder.
[06:42.290 --> 06:47.890]  So many people thought it was DMV referred to the area of DC, Maryland and Virginia.
[06:47.890 --> 06:48.990]  And they're like, yeah, I live there.
[06:49.030 --> 06:51.450]  I live in the DMV metro area.
[06:52.130 --> 06:55.090]  So I think that you can't just throw an acronym out there and say,
[06:55.210 --> 06:56.290]  do you know what this acronym means?
[06:56.390 --> 06:58.710]  Because it could mean a million things to a million different people.
[07:00.390 --> 07:02.030]  I don't know, 5,000.
[07:02.290 --> 07:03.630]  I, it seemed universal.
[07:03.810 --> 07:04.930]  I mean, I'm going through the comments.
[07:05.010 --> 07:07.430]  I'm trying to find people that relate to you.
[07:07.870 --> 07:11.750]  Somebody said it's obviously the district of Metro Vancouver with like a shrug emoji.
[07:11.870 --> 07:12.550]  Like that's a joke.
[07:12.650 --> 07:13.450]  I don't know if you want to count.
[07:13.490 --> 07:14.490]  I don't think that's a shrug emoji.
[07:14.730 --> 07:15.990]  They're like, I guess that's what it means.
[07:17.190 --> 07:18.830]  I, I'm pretty, I don't know.
[07:18.830 --> 07:22.450]  I think they're all jokes that you're trying to claim credit for.
[07:24.570 --> 07:30.310]  So, so Andrew, what do you think is, so 5% to you, 5% of comment leavers,
[07:30.530 --> 07:32.850]  you're saying aren't worth giving a shit about.
[07:33.050 --> 07:35.530]  What percentage would you start caring about?
[07:35.770 --> 07:37.110]  I disagree. I was apologizing.
[07:37.130 --> 07:40.670]  Yeah, what's the minimum percentage that you need to care about the audience?
[07:41.070 --> 07:44.430]  I was saying to Geoff that I, it's very important to include that 5.5.
[07:44.530 --> 07:48.270]  I wanted to apologize on behalf of the 5.5 that I didn't realize existed.
[07:48.270 --> 07:50.950]  Now Gavin, I'd like to ask you a question.
[07:51.470 --> 07:57.050]  On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being absolute sincerity,
[07:57.750 --> 08:00.710]  1 being Andrew's taking a shit on the comment leavers,
[08:00.910 --> 08:03.550]  where do you think he falls in that statement?
[08:03.970 --> 08:05.530]  Can I answer in fractions, Geoff?
[08:05.750 --> 08:06.090]  Yes.
[08:06.370 --> 08:07.950]  0.2.
[08:08.590 --> 08:10.230]  Okay, okay.
[08:10.350 --> 08:11.890]  Is that, that's not, that's a decimal.
[08:14.290 --> 08:15.310]  1 5th.
[08:15.630 --> 08:16.270]  1 5th.
[08:16.750 --> 08:17.790]  1 5th.
[08:18.350 --> 08:19.750]  Is that, do I want to lower?
[08:20.050 --> 08:21.790]  Yeah, like I don't understand what that means.
[08:21.930 --> 08:23.330]  What's the scale? It's low, high?
[08:23.730 --> 08:24.950]  Yeah, that's below 1.
[08:27.110 --> 08:28.130]  Okay, that's okay.
[08:28.810 --> 08:30.630]  That's not just shitting, that's diarrhea.
[08:31.330 --> 08:33.990]  No, it's 1, but we don't know the scale is 1 good or bad.
[08:34.130 --> 08:35.090]  Is 1 very sincere?
[08:35.090 --> 08:36.270]  What's bad, dude? We already said that.
[08:36.390 --> 08:36.890]  Outline the scale.
[08:37.150 --> 08:38.630]  We don't know the scale, he just listed it.
[08:38.710 --> 08:40.350]  What are you doing? Are you staring at a bird?
[08:40.590 --> 08:42.070]  Are you staring at a woman piss out your window?
[08:42.070 --> 08:46.010]  No, I'm reading the fucking tweets that Geoff is claiming exists.
[08:46.010 --> 08:47.950]  None of them exist, I was reading through them.
[08:48.870 --> 08:51.210]  Can I tell you something Geoff? I need to, a second.
[08:51.370 --> 08:54.090]  This is a, this is an also equally real apology.
[08:54.830 --> 08:58.270]  I made fun of you for the DMV thing and I texted Gavin this later.
[08:59.910 --> 09:01.930]  We made fun of you about the Soho house.
[09:02.030 --> 09:04.990]  Once again, you not explaining the Soho house and then you doing the whole thing
[09:04.990 --> 09:06.430]  and then you explain the Soho house.
[09:06.530 --> 09:08.910]  I stopped listening as soon as you explained the Soho house.
[09:08.950 --> 09:10.970]  I had to explain it to him after the episode.
[09:13.090 --> 09:16.650]  And something happened and I got distracted and my mind just vanished.
[09:16.730 --> 09:19.590]  And then I came back to you concluding your Soho house explanation.
[09:19.970 --> 09:22.330]  I was like, I guess I just am not going to know what the Soho house is.
[09:22.410 --> 09:24.870]  I like that as someone who's confused, your brain thinks,
[09:25.050 --> 09:27.130]  I need to do something about this. I need to do some work.
[09:27.210 --> 09:30.250]  I need to ask so I'm not confused anywhere anymore.
[09:30.570 --> 09:32.430]  And then you ask and you're like, job done.
[09:32.610 --> 09:34.550]  And you actually don't listen to the bit after.
[09:35.170 --> 09:38.450]  No, I was trying to, I think I was trying to pull up a photo or something.
[09:38.450 --> 09:41.190]  And then it's just, you know, your mind wanders sometimes.
[09:41.370 --> 09:44.230]  Geoff is familiar with this. Oh, Geoff all the time.
[09:44.270 --> 09:50.150]  Yeah, no, it sounds incredible. I'm surprised at how similar Andrew and I are in some ways.
[09:50.370 --> 09:52.190]  It sounds incredibly familiar.
[09:53.630 --> 09:55.510]  Like Andrew's making that statement to me.
[09:55.750 --> 09:57.730]  And I'm like, well, yeah, of course you stopped listening.
[09:57.890 --> 09:58.910]  I probably did too.
[10:00.630 --> 10:01.950]  I'm not listening to this.
[10:04.690 --> 10:05.570]  Oh dear.
[10:05.790 --> 10:08.110]  I was proofing one of the earlier episodes.
[10:08.450 --> 10:13.210]  A few days ago, this was before the fire extinguisher.
[10:13.470 --> 10:16.190]  And I think it was one of the ones leading up to it.
[10:16.270 --> 10:21.210]  And Andrew used the phrase, you don't understand the level of elaborate
[10:21.210 --> 10:25.150]  when describing like all the stuff you needed to buy for the fire extinguisher.
[10:25.430 --> 10:27.990]  You just put it in 12 bags.
[10:28.530 --> 10:30.090]  What are you talking about?
[10:30.310 --> 10:32.570]  That was shit you could have had already under your sink.
[10:32.730 --> 10:36.050]  What's elaborate about rummaging around for bags?
[10:37.170 --> 10:38.610]  That's a great question.
[10:39.170 --> 10:40.830]  Yeah, it is a great question.
[10:40.970 --> 10:42.090]  And I have an answer for it.
[10:42.330 --> 10:46.350]  As I said, I believe last week, that wasn't my original plan.
[10:46.510 --> 10:48.590]  I was going to build a Dexter kill room.
[10:48.710 --> 10:52.030]  And that was very elaborate of like putting all the sheets up
[10:52.030 --> 10:53.730]  and like creating a door for it.
[10:53.910 --> 10:57.350]  Yeah, but the constant downfall with all your plans
[10:57.350 --> 11:00.970]  isn't like a major obstacle rearing its ugly head.
[11:01.050 --> 11:03.810]  You'll probably just sat there and then you just think, nah.
[11:03.810 --> 11:06.610]  No, I couldn't figure out how to tape the ceiling.
[11:07.130 --> 11:11.350]  Gavin, you didn't understand the level of elaborate
[11:11.350 --> 11:13.690]  and Andrew didn't understand the level of effort.
[11:14.730 --> 11:16.190]  And they just didn't line up.
[11:17.310 --> 11:19.890]  You couldn't figure out how to tape stuff to the ceiling?
[11:20.350 --> 11:21.470]  No, it's not my ceiling.
[11:21.690 --> 11:22.630]  I don't want to fuck up.
[11:22.730 --> 11:23.630]  I'm renting a place.
[11:23.790 --> 11:25.470]  I don't want to fuck up the paint on the ceiling.
[11:25.550 --> 11:27.310]  It just seemed like, I don't know, I couldn't figure it out.
[11:27.730 --> 11:29.430]  Do you have like white spirit?
[11:29.550 --> 11:30.590]  What's in the fire extinguisher?
[11:30.690 --> 11:31.250]  What do you think is going to happen?
[11:31.250 --> 11:31.550]  What do you mean?
[11:31.610 --> 11:33.070]  It fucking shoots everywhere.
[11:33.070 --> 11:33.870]  It's a powder.
[11:34.070 --> 11:34.990]  It just goes everywhere.
[11:35.110 --> 11:36.110]  It'd be a goddamn mess.
[11:36.150 --> 11:37.030]  Just sweep it up.
[11:37.650 --> 11:38.650]  What color is your ceiling?
[11:38.830 --> 11:40.090]  Sweep the fucking ceiling?
[11:40.510 --> 11:41.110]  What do you want?
[11:41.490 --> 11:42.350]  What color is your ceiling?
[11:43.070 --> 11:45.130]  It's white, but it's not the same.
[11:45.530 --> 11:47.010]  No, it's fucking...
[11:47.010 --> 11:48.690]  No, that's not how that works.
[11:49.970 --> 11:51.130]  White, but it's chem...
[11:51.130 --> 11:51.570]  It's a chem...
[11:51.570 --> 11:52.850]  I can't just fucking...
[11:52.850 --> 11:53.430]  That'd be terrible.
[11:53.770 --> 11:53.910]  Problem solved.
[11:54.290 --> 11:54.590]  No.
[11:54.750 --> 11:55.770]  It sounds like it took care of itself.
[11:56.030 --> 11:58.530]  It sounds like you can paint the ceiling really quickly for free.
[11:59.650 --> 12:01.370]  I don't want to paint the ceiling though.
[12:01.370 --> 12:04.690]  I'm fine with the current color of the ceiling.
[12:05.330 --> 12:05.990]  Everything's good.
[12:06.870 --> 12:09.030]  It didn't even go off, so I'm glad I didn't...
[12:09.030 --> 12:10.450]  Well, it did, you know, like it was...
[12:10.450 --> 12:11.230]  It sneezed.
[12:11.310 --> 12:12.570]  I didn't expect it to sneeze.
[12:12.990 --> 12:14.450]  I gotta be honest with you, Andrew.
[12:14.650 --> 12:17.850]  If you're trying to keep the integrity of this apartment together
[12:17.850 --> 12:21.230]  because someday you want to move out and get the security deposit back,
[12:21.350 --> 12:23.810]  I don't think the fire extinguisher is going to be why you don't get it.
[12:23.850 --> 12:26.330]  I think it's going to be any of the million other things you've done.
[12:27.170 --> 12:27.570]  Yeah.
[12:27.890 --> 12:28.590]  No, that's fair.
[12:29.150 --> 12:30.870]  I mean, there's some holes in the wall.
[12:30.870 --> 12:31.890]  There's some falls.
[12:32.230 --> 12:32.970]  Falls have happened.
[12:34.050 --> 12:36.970]  I mean, yeah, I have other issues beyond the fire extinguisher.
[12:37.310 --> 12:38.890]  Do you think it's for the best you live in an apartment?
[12:39.210 --> 12:42.090]  Like, if you lived in a house, would it just be trashed because you would care less?
[12:42.110 --> 12:44.310]  No, no, no, I would take...
[12:44.310 --> 12:45.390]  No, definitely not.
[12:45.610 --> 12:46.450]  It'd be nice to have a house.
[12:46.650 --> 12:48.850]  I think Andrew's a fairly conscientious lad.
[12:49.310 --> 12:51.050]  Yeah, I'm pretty mindful, thanks.
[12:51.710 --> 12:52.230]  It's different.
[12:52.390 --> 12:54.510]  Like, it's a weird thing where I don't, you know...
[12:54.510 --> 12:58.270]  If it was my house, I would have just fired the fire extinguisher without cause.
[12:58.390 --> 12:59.770]  Like, whatever, I'll deal with it.
[12:59.770 --> 13:02.250]  But other people's spaces...
[13:02.250 --> 13:02.730]  You tread lightly.
[13:03.590 --> 13:04.330]  Even as a rigger.
[13:04.630 --> 13:06.850]  And I feel like you often don't want to inconvenience other people.
[13:06.950 --> 13:07.830]  We've had evidence of that.
[13:07.910 --> 13:08.390]  Oh, absolutely.
[13:08.570 --> 13:10.050]  Oh no, I've left water in the bath.
[13:10.110 --> 13:12.090]  Let me bail it out with a popcorn bucket.
[13:12.610 --> 13:13.050]  Levels of...
[13:13.050 --> 13:14.330]  Uh, that was...
[13:15.270 --> 13:16.090]  That was more...
[13:16.090 --> 13:17.190]  Yeah, I guess what was...
[13:17.190 --> 13:20.410]  That was like, this is a problem I don't know how to solve, but I can't leave...
[13:20.410 --> 13:21.710]  Yeah, so I guess that qualifies.
[13:21.910 --> 13:22.790]  Yeah, but if it was...
[13:22.790 --> 13:25.610]  If you knew no one else was going in there that day, you probably would have just left it.
[13:27.930 --> 13:28.770]  Yeah, I don't know.
[13:28.770 --> 13:29.390]  Maybe.
[13:29.650 --> 13:31.450]  I could see that possibly being the case.
[13:31.810 --> 13:34.710]  It's mainly just like, I want this to be somebody else's problem,
[13:34.790 --> 13:37.410]  and to not know that it was me who caused it was more of the motive.
[13:40.210 --> 13:42.910]  If you could walk away cleanly, then...
[13:42.910 --> 13:46.730]  Yeah, no, that was definitely more the mindset of, I can't solve this,
[13:46.830 --> 13:49.510]  and if I leave the water in, somebody will be like, who did this?
[13:49.530 --> 13:52.990]  So if I remove all the water, then whoever uses that next will be like,
[13:53.030 --> 13:55.150]  how do I get this drain open and it becomes their problem?
[13:55.930 --> 13:57.590]  Incredibly honest answer you've given.
[13:57.590 --> 14:02.530]  Oh man, speaking of inconveniencing people, Gav, I feel like I should make a statement,
[14:02.750 --> 14:08.290]  because I got a couple of angry social media notices this week from people.
[14:08.730 --> 14:13.210]  Gavin and I have made... if you live in the Central Texas area, this is not our fault.
[14:13.610 --> 14:16.750]  Gavin and I have made no plans to hang out in the last two weeks.
[14:17.210 --> 14:18.870]  We did not cause this rain.
[14:19.070 --> 14:22.550]  I have made no plans on my own without Gavin since the last time I made plans.
[14:22.830 --> 14:25.350]  I didn't make this rain. I don't want this rain.
[14:25.350 --> 14:28.050]  Unless Gavin's been making secret plans behind my back.
[14:28.530 --> 14:29.710]  It's not me.
[14:29.870 --> 14:33.870]  So stop yelling at me on Twitter and social media about it if you live in Central Texas.
[14:34.070 --> 14:35.850]  I didn't do it. I stopped.
[14:36.210 --> 14:36.610]  I stopped.
[14:36.930 --> 14:38.670]  It's been stormy as shit again.
[14:38.810 --> 14:41.150]  And I guess we will go into this episode.
[14:41.530 --> 14:43.130]  The Halo bet is still on.
[14:43.770 --> 14:45.110]  We've had some movement on it.
[14:45.950 --> 14:49.910]  Do we want to... yeah, I guess at this point people know that Andrew...
[14:49.910 --> 14:51.230]  We didn't really understand the bet.
[14:51.410 --> 14:54.030]  We gave Andrew another go at the level.
[14:54.030 --> 14:56.450]  And he did in fact beat my time.
[14:56.770 --> 14:57.190]  I was great.
[14:57.310 --> 15:03.890]  So I, uh, from when he says go, I now have a 24 hour response period to, uh, to beat that time,
[15:03.910 --> 15:05.710]  which is I think 4.20 now on outskirts.
[15:05.970 --> 15:09.810]  Uh, last night I was, I was just thinking, I, you know, I should probably, I might,
[15:09.870 --> 15:11.410]  I might want to start my time now.
[15:11.470 --> 15:12.770]  I might want to just go straight into it.
[15:12.770 --> 15:13.890]  Cause I've got a busy week.
[15:14.030 --> 15:16.170]  I've got like a solid eight hours where I'm free.
[15:16.610 --> 15:17.530]  So I sat down.
[15:17.570 --> 15:19.690]  I just thought, yeah, I think I could do it now.
[15:19.710 --> 15:20.430]  I loaded up Halo.
[15:20.730 --> 15:21.510]  My power went out.
[15:24.130 --> 15:26.470]  The storm, the storm kicked me out of that.
[15:26.650 --> 15:28.530]  This might be the change of year two.
[15:28.690 --> 15:30.070]  I might start winning bets.
[15:30.410 --> 15:30.970]  This is great.
[15:31.070 --> 15:32.290]  The universe is on my side.
[15:32.350 --> 15:33.210]  It's fucking up your power.
[15:33.370 --> 15:36.370]  Cause I, I texted Gavin saying I was paranoid of that happening.
[15:36.730 --> 15:38.770]  Uh, and, and, and I know why it didn't now.
[15:38.870 --> 15:39.370]  This is great.
[15:39.630 --> 15:40.750]  I checked even this morning.
[15:40.810 --> 15:43.170]  I didn't believe you that, that like you weren't going to do a move.
[15:43.590 --> 15:45.350]  We talked about him starting on Friday.
[15:45.890 --> 15:51.710]  Also, I realized I gave it, I gave a 70% at the, uh, at me being able to beat you back.
[15:51.890 --> 15:54.110]  But I was, my time was 422.
[15:54.330 --> 15:58.850]  I was expecting to have to beat a 421, but you've given me a 420.
[15:58.970 --> 16:02.390]  And I, I would like to reduce my percentage of confidence to about 30%.
[16:03.030 --> 16:09.610]  Did you, did you give him a 420 as a, an insulting meme, uh, on top as well?
[16:09.810 --> 16:10.950]  No, it just happened that way.
[16:10.950 --> 16:15.370]  So it took, I did two completed runs and the first one I tied him.
[16:15.630 --> 16:17.190]  And that was honestly a little bit devastating.
[16:17.310 --> 16:20.470]  Cause I never even got close last time we did this bet.
[16:20.910 --> 16:24.570]  So first one, I tied him and then I just got lucky at a few different spots.
[16:24.570 --> 16:27.650]  And I was able to just get 420, which I'm very happy with.
[16:27.770 --> 16:31.570]  How long did it take you to, to, to take the time back?
[16:32.170 --> 16:33.170]  Uh, 90 minutes.
[16:33.710 --> 16:36.330]  It didn't take long at all for when we started.
[16:36.990 --> 16:40.810]  Yeah, I was watching cause he, this is the first time I think that he streamed it.
[16:41.190 --> 16:42.990]  Everyone, he just, you tweeted, didn't you?
[16:43.530 --> 16:46.970]  And by the time I saw that you were live, there were like 200 people watching.
[16:47.070 --> 16:49.030]  And I was like, Oh, this is a, this is a thing now.
[16:49.730 --> 16:53.170]  The moment he beat it, the chat went apeshit.
[16:53.290 --> 16:55.310]  It was like, there were 2000 people watching.
[16:55.830 --> 16:56.810]  It was nuts.
[16:57.050 --> 16:58.570]  Everyone was very excited for him.
[16:58.950 --> 17:02.890]  A quiet highlight for me was about 15 minutes before I beat it, maybe 20.
[17:03.010 --> 17:05.270]  I just tweeted or I texted Gavin, I hate you.
[17:05.690 --> 17:07.370]  And he replied, why do you hate?
[17:07.510 --> 17:08.450]  And then I beat the time.
[17:08.530 --> 17:10.270]  And as soon as I beat it, Gavin texted me back.
[17:10.270 --> 17:10.850]  I hate you.
[17:10.890 --> 17:12.130]  And I replied, why do you hate?
[17:12.690 --> 17:14.530]  I'm very excited about this.
[17:15.110 --> 17:19.870]  So Gavin, are you, are you going to, are you going to stream your attempt to, to take the title back?
[17:21.370 --> 17:24.590]  Uh, well, so I, the, the, I'm not good at it.
[17:24.690 --> 17:25.450]  I'm no good at Halo.
[17:25.650 --> 17:28.350]  The only thing I've got going for me is my new techniques.
[17:28.710 --> 17:30.030]  So I can't give away the new techniques.
[17:33.110 --> 17:36.370]  It can't be streamed and I won't reveal my new techniques until the bet's over.
[17:38.790 --> 17:40.950]  That's what scares me is I don't know what is bullshit.
[17:41.090 --> 17:45.430]  He's cheating in some way, or he's got like some weird thing you have.
[17:45.750 --> 17:48.250]  The way Andrew is doing it is like a professional speed runner.
[17:48.350 --> 17:52.430]  The way I'm doing it is like an achievement hunter.
[17:55.330 --> 17:56.730]  I'm just getting like ridiculous.
[17:56.890 --> 18:01.650]  I think the world record time for that level on Legendary is four minutes, 14 seconds.
[18:01.650 --> 18:06.990]  So like we're, we're edging to like elite territory as far as the time goes.
[18:07.130 --> 18:08.530]  Are you guys playing it on Legendary?
[18:09.110 --> 18:11.870]  Yeah, these are legendary solo speed runs.
[18:12.410 --> 18:13.650]  So it's not Lasso or anything.
[18:13.850 --> 18:15.250]  It's just a legendary solo.
[18:15.950 --> 18:16.950]  We're on Legendary?
[18:17.450 --> 18:19.130]  Yeah. You didn't know that?
[18:19.570 --> 18:20.990]  Oh, you're right. Yeah, we are.
[18:21.410 --> 18:24.370]  Yeah, we are. Yeah. It's kind of an important thing to know.
[18:24.670 --> 18:25.770]  Uh, it is important. Yeah.
[18:25.990 --> 18:26.250]  Yeah.
[18:26.990 --> 18:28.370]  How did you not know that?
[18:28.570 --> 18:29.730]  I'll be honest, I totally forgot.
[18:29.850 --> 18:31.130]  How the fuck did you get your time?
[18:31.650 --> 18:32.630]  How did this happen?
[18:33.270 --> 18:35.390]  Your time is so difficult to pass.
[18:36.050 --> 18:36.730]  What do you, okay.
[18:36.830 --> 18:39.090]  What do you, what do you think my new techniques are?
[18:39.170 --> 18:39.890]  What do you think's going on?
[18:39.910 --> 18:40.690]  I have no idea.
[18:40.830 --> 18:42.070]  You're cheating in some way.
[18:42.210 --> 18:47.290]  You're like either you have all the skulls on, which means something, I think, but I don't know what it means.
[18:47.850 --> 18:50.670]  Maybe you're like launching yourself with grenades super high.
[18:50.770 --> 18:52.210]  I think there's a propel one.
[18:52.310 --> 18:52.790]  I don't know.
[18:53.070 --> 18:57.250]  He's like wedging a warthog through a gate and bouncing through it or something.
[18:57.850 --> 18:59.270]  Getting past the enemies.
[18:59.270 --> 19:01.490]  Whatever he's doing is immediate.
[19:01.610 --> 19:04.750]  He has no idea that it's legendary because he hasn't faced an enemy.
[19:07.430 --> 19:08.170]  No, I will say this.
[19:08.350 --> 19:11.010]  My, my, uh, new techniques, they helped me a lot at the beginning.
[19:11.150 --> 19:14.050]  They make it much, much harder at the end.
[19:15.510 --> 19:17.370]  I can't wait to find out what they are.
[19:17.490 --> 19:22.450]  Like watching you breeze through the, uh, the driving sequence is really annoying to watch.
[19:23.590 --> 19:25.330]  Well, I can't figure out your beginning part.
[19:25.330 --> 19:29.710]  The thing is, there is one method that I haven't been able to pull off that Gavin is aware of
[19:29.710 --> 19:33.210]  using, uh, a ship, a pelican to like bounce off of it.
[19:33.710 --> 19:37.350]  Uh, so he could theoretically just focus his run on that and beat it.
[19:37.690 --> 19:41.750]  Last night, Gavin, I was so excited by the premise of you having to suffer through this
[19:41.750 --> 19:44.970]  level because I've probably put like six or seven hours into it at this point.
[19:45.050 --> 19:45.930]  You haven't had to do much.
[19:46.510 --> 19:50.650]  Um, but then this morning I was just struck with fear of what if you beat the time?
[19:51.050 --> 19:55.190]  I'm going to be terrified until your time is up.
[19:55.190 --> 19:58.550]  The other week when, uh, you were streaming just to me.
[19:58.970 --> 19:59.110]  Yeah.
[19:59.310 --> 20:03.250]  I had it on in the corner while I was just doing other stuff and Meg glanced it.
[20:03.490 --> 20:06.730]  And she was like, Oh, this is the level. I remember when you were doing this.
[20:06.830 --> 20:11.070]  I remember how miserable you were because it was months ago for me.
[20:11.230 --> 20:15.830]  And now it's just right back in my life and it's, it's a horrible feeling.
[20:15.870 --> 20:18.590]  That's why I wrote, this is the worst thing that could have possibly happened.
[20:18.790 --> 20:20.410]  Oh, it's great.
[20:20.810 --> 20:21.290]  I can't wait.
[20:21.470 --> 20:24.530]  I feel, um, like there were about 200 people watching the stream.
[20:24.530 --> 20:27.970]  That was like, I feel like a really special moment for all of those comment leavers
[20:27.970 --> 20:32.630]  who actually got to witness that happen live, because it wasn't really advertised by this show.
[20:32.990 --> 20:34.870]  It just happened to be on your Twitter.
[20:35.430 --> 20:37.350]  So that was quite a, probably a cool moment to have witnessed.
[20:37.690 --> 20:42.330]  Not only was this not advertised, we're the, this is the fucking worst bet we've ever done.
[20:42.410 --> 20:45.850]  It's a 24 hour bet. It probably will end within 24 hours.
[20:46.070 --> 20:48.150]  It's taken six episodes to resolve.
[20:48.530 --> 20:50.430]  It'll probably resolve next one.
[20:50.430 --> 20:54.590]  It's like six weeks of this process of like starting, ending.
[20:54.930 --> 21:00.650]  I set a new time for you the day before the episode came out that declared me the loser of the bet.
[21:00.770 --> 21:02.870]  We're a mess. It makes no sense.
[21:03.270 --> 21:05.290]  Like the organization is just dreadful.
[21:05.690 --> 21:08.870]  I would love to stream it too, but I can't have you watching it.
[21:08.950 --> 21:11.270]  And I know that the comment leavers will leave comments for you.
[21:11.630 --> 21:11.890]  Yeah.
[21:12.030 --> 21:12.790]  Telling you what I'm doing.
[21:13.390 --> 21:14.970]  So it's unfortunately...
[21:14.970 --> 21:16.610]  I was gonna say, I would commit to not watching.
[21:16.810 --> 21:19.150]  Yeah, but you could, people would, people would still...
[21:19.150 --> 21:20.490]  You can't trust the comment leavers.
[21:20.710 --> 21:27.510]  And also like, Gavin's whole schtick is subterfuge and misdirection.
[21:27.790 --> 21:28.330]  That's all I've got.
[21:28.510 --> 21:28.710]  Yeah.
[21:29.050 --> 21:32.250]  Because I've not got that E of the talent and I've seen Andrew has it.
[21:32.450 --> 21:33.390]  He's got to lean into that.
[21:33.450 --> 21:35.650]  While Andrew has ability, Gavin has other skills.
[21:36.150 --> 21:37.730]  Where do you think you fall on that scale, Geoff?
[21:38.650 --> 21:39.530]  At the bottom?
[21:41.010 --> 21:42.570]  Like on the, in the dirt?
[21:45.630 --> 21:49.930]  Like in the dirt next to like a rusty nail and a washer that was probably,
[21:50.550 --> 21:52.950]  that was probably, that probably fell off at some point.
[21:53.050 --> 21:54.150]  Nobody knows where to put it back.
[21:55.770 --> 21:56.570]  Oh God.
[21:57.130 --> 21:58.890]  That's why I don't make these kinds of bets.
[21:59.710 --> 22:01.470]  Yeah. Why have you never been involved in it?
[22:01.930 --> 22:05.590]  Well, A, because if I made a bet like that, I would have to win it.
[22:05.650 --> 22:07.490]  Like I don't have an option internally.
[22:08.230 --> 22:11.370]  And the amount of, so it's like, it's like when you,
[22:11.370 --> 22:15.930]  when you have that thing broken in you, you have to wage like,
[22:16.790 --> 22:21.970]  is the long-term damage to me going to be worth winning the bet?
[22:22.050 --> 22:25.090]  Like whatever I have to do to make sure that I win the bet,
[22:25.170 --> 22:27.150]  is that going to be worth it long-term for the rest of my life?
[22:27.330 --> 22:28.250]  And it's usually no.
[22:28.330 --> 22:31.090]  So I have to be very careful how I, how I, how I go about these bets.
[22:31.610 --> 22:31.970]  Okay.
[22:32.430 --> 22:37.090]  Because I will, I will, I will do unhealthy things to myself in the process of winning it.
[22:37.250 --> 22:38.650]  You have been challenged though.
[22:38.830 --> 22:41.070]  It's not a bet, but there has been a challenge issued.
[22:41.070 --> 22:41.470]  When?
[22:41.970 --> 22:44.750]  With a certain beverage and some chuggage.
[22:44.910 --> 22:46.830]  Oh my God, I forgot. I need to.
[22:47.250 --> 22:49.990]  Oh, Gav, I'm so sorry. I was going to do that for you.
[22:50.110 --> 22:51.310]  And I didn't do it. I'll do it today.
[22:51.650 --> 22:52.550]  You can do it now.
[22:53.050 --> 22:56.350]  Well, I don't have, I don't have, well, no, because we're in the episode and stuff.
[22:56.450 --> 22:56.970]  I'll do it later.
[22:58.090 --> 22:59.710]  Wait, what's the, what's the bet?
[23:00.130 --> 23:04.050]  Oh, he's, Geoff sent me a TikTok recently of a guy, it was amazing TikTok of a guy
[23:04.050 --> 23:08.230]  trying to chug a whole soda without burping a single time.
[23:08.350 --> 23:10.330]  And then he like freaks out, slams his head on something.
[23:10.330 --> 23:12.950]  But then just the act of actually doing that is so difficult.
[23:13.550 --> 23:16.790]  And Meg and I would, Meg wanted to make a video of us doing it,
[23:16.890 --> 23:17.890]  and we would send it to Geoff.
[23:18.590 --> 23:21.790]  And then Geoff decided he would also try, but I haven't heard anything.
[23:21.850 --> 23:23.750]  And then I immediately forgot.
[23:24.190 --> 23:25.330]  So I will do it today.
[23:25.470 --> 23:28.790]  And I'm going to drink, because all I have right now is Dr. Pepper Zero Sugar.
[23:28.890 --> 23:29.970]  So that's what I'll be drinking today.
[23:30.090 --> 23:31.170]  And I'll, I'll, fuck, dude.
[23:32.790 --> 23:34.230]  Text me so I don't forget. I'll forget again.
[23:34.310 --> 23:35.010]  I really want to do it.
[23:35.070 --> 23:36.010]  I think I could do better than you did.
[23:36.370 --> 23:37.910]  I think anybody could do better than you did.
[23:37.930 --> 23:39.030]  Honestly, that was pretty funny.
[23:39.030 --> 23:40.590]  Are you going to re-shoot that video?
[23:41.330 --> 23:42.270]  No, that was just for you.
[23:42.530 --> 23:43.510]  I mean, I could do one proper.
[23:43.970 --> 23:48.850]  But I feel like if I do do it, I want to move immediately onto a second can.
[23:48.890 --> 23:50.330]  I want to see how much I can get.
[23:50.470 --> 23:51.950]  Because I'm terrible at chugging anyway.
[23:52.610 --> 23:55.430]  And you kind of want to burp after like a quarter of a can.
[23:55.750 --> 23:56.570]  And it just builds up.
[23:56.610 --> 23:57.750]  And it gets to the point where you're just like
[23:57.750 --> 24:00.730]  trying to swallow over the top of air that's coming up.
[24:00.770 --> 24:02.030]  And it's really, really weird feeling.
[24:02.390 --> 24:04.090]  But I want to see if I can get through two cans.
[24:04.150 --> 24:05.130]  I think that'd be the ultimate goal.
[24:05.130 --> 24:06.510]  Can it be any soda?
[24:06.750 --> 24:07.850]  And are we talking cans?
[24:07.990 --> 24:09.650]  Like specifically just standard size?
[24:09.950 --> 24:10.590]  Standard size can.
[24:10.690 --> 24:12.830]  And I think it could be any carbonated beverage.
[24:13.090 --> 24:14.950]  Any 12 ounce carbonated beverage.
[24:15.390 --> 24:15.990]  Are you in, Andrew?
[24:16.310 --> 24:18.390]  Yeah, I feel like this isn't even hard to do.
[24:18.510 --> 24:19.890]  I don't understand why this is a challenge.
[24:20.390 --> 24:22.290]  Send him the video of you and Meg doing it.
[24:24.430 --> 24:25.230]  The video...
[24:25.230 --> 24:25.670]  I think I can do three.
[24:25.970 --> 24:29.290]  The video, the TikTok that I sent Gavin, by the way, it was very funny.
[24:29.390 --> 24:31.050]  But the funniest part is after the guy,
[24:31.230 --> 24:33.550]  the guy almost throws up and shits his pants.
[24:33.550 --> 24:38.450]  And he turns around in pain and slams his head into a garage door.
[24:38.530 --> 24:39.630]  And that's the real fucking...
[24:40.710 --> 24:42.190]  Yeah, it's like, oh, I don't know what to...
[24:42.190 --> 24:43.070]  The cherry on top.
[24:43.810 --> 24:44.950]  So how do...
[24:44.950 --> 24:46.990]  When can I burp, theoretically?
[24:47.290 --> 24:49.950]  Like, is it a three count after I've done the soda and I've done it?
[24:49.970 --> 24:52.130]  You hold it as long as humanly possible.
[24:52.930 --> 24:54.150]  So, but like, to what end?
[24:54.150 --> 24:55.780]  My goal is never to burp.
[24:56.830 --> 24:57.850]  Seven days later.
[24:57.950 --> 24:59.250]  You can burp a week later.
[24:59.870 --> 25:02.270]  No, I think the goal should be...
[25:02.270 --> 25:03.290]  Because I feel like one is doable.
[25:03.290 --> 25:04.910]  I'm on the brink of being able to do one.
[25:05.330 --> 25:08.430]  I think the ultimate goal is to get two full cans down back to back.
[25:09.610 --> 25:11.230]  Crystal clear waters.
[25:11.950 --> 25:12.950]  White sandy beaches.
[25:13.890 --> 25:16.030]  Tropical drinks with little umbrellas.
[25:16.790 --> 25:19.830]  Stress doesn't exist here, but it could back at home
[25:19.830 --> 25:23.430]  where an undetected water leak can turn into costly water damage.
[25:24.470 --> 25:28.210]  But with Moen Flow, you can enjoy your vacation with no worries.
[25:28.650 --> 25:32.790]  It detects leaks and stops your water main automatically from anywhere.
[25:33.290 --> 25:37.450]  So the only thing on your mind is having nothing on your mind.
[25:38.090 --> 25:38.430]  Moen.
[25:39.470 --> 25:42.650]  This episode is brought to you by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery.
[25:42.950 --> 25:45.990]  The Grateful Dead and Dogfish Head have gotten the band back together

[25:52.510 --> 25:56.050]  and heaps of good karma for a refreshing brew that's music to your taste buds.

[26:09.330 --> 26:10.330]  Buenos dias!
[26:10.610 --> 26:14.610]  Café Bustelo espresso-styled iced coffee is hitting refrigerators
[26:14.610 --> 26:17.090]  with a cold front that'll sweep through your senses.
[26:17.370 --> 26:20.690]  So keep the coffee pours long and the cold sips low.
[26:21.110 --> 26:24.810]  Then you can burp.
[26:25.490 --> 26:25.810]  Okay.
[26:26.090 --> 26:27.030]  I don't think that's possible.
[26:27.610 --> 26:28.450]  I think I can do three.
[26:28.790 --> 26:29.750]  I don't think that's hard.
[26:30.330 --> 26:31.670]  You got any cans nearby, Andrew?
[26:31.670 --> 26:32.590]  No, I don't.
[26:32.710 --> 26:34.370]  If I did, I'd absolutely try it right now.
[26:34.430 --> 26:35.350]  I don't have any cans or anything.
[26:35.790 --> 26:36.010]  Damn it.
[26:36.030 --> 26:36.970]  I have some apple juice.
[26:37.330 --> 26:38.010]  I don't think that'll work.
[26:38.010 --> 26:38.590]  That's not gonna...
[26:38.590 --> 26:40.250]  I don't want to listen to you chug apple juice.
[26:43.370 --> 26:44.110]  Oh my god.
[26:44.110 --> 26:44.450]  I wouldn't mind.
[26:44.970 --> 26:46.030]  It's a great juice.
[26:51.640 --> 26:52.640]  Why does one...
[26:52.640 --> 26:55.120]  No, why does everyone need a VPN?
[26:55.760 --> 27:00.720]  Well, first of all, your ISP can sell your information to ad companies and tech giants
[27:00.720 --> 27:07.740]  who can then use your data to target you with all kinds of ads for fake counterfeit collectible
[27:07.740 --> 27:08.220]  thimbles.
[27:08.560 --> 27:11.420]  And you're like, I know it's a counterfeit thimble.
[27:11.540 --> 27:12.340]  The price is too good.
[27:12.520 --> 27:17.140]  But now I got to go through the process of checking and looking and saying, it's not
[27:17.140 --> 27:17.580]  worth it.
[27:17.880 --> 27:20.240]  So I would recommend using ExpressVPN.
[27:20.620 --> 27:25.720]  It creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet so that your
[27:25.720 --> 27:30.760]  online activity, aka collectible spoon shopping, can't be seen by anyone.
[27:31.020 --> 27:36.200]  That business is between you and the other person on the end of that spoon sale.
[27:36.560 --> 27:36.600]  Right?
[27:36.980 --> 27:41.240]  It doesn't... it does... none of my... anybody else's business, but you and the spoon salesman
[27:41.240 --> 27:41.700]  person.
[27:42.020 --> 27:45.580]  It's as easy as closing the bathroom door, which you should also do.
[27:45.880 --> 27:46.820]  Fire up the app.
[27:47.240 --> 27:48.240]  Click one button.

[27:51.540 --> 27:54.280]  It works on phones and laptops and routers.
[27:54.280 --> 27:57.520]  So everyone who shares your Wi-Fi can be protected.
[27:57.800 --> 28:03.940]  It's entirely possible that I use ExpressVPN when I may or may not buy collectible thimbles
[28:03.940 --> 28:07.340]  and spoons from mostly Europe and the UK.
[28:07.480 --> 28:08.480]  They're not as big here in America.
[28:08.640 --> 28:11.620]  But if I'm doing that, you don't know because I'm probably using ExpressVPN.
[28:12.340 --> 28:13.280]  It's a game changer.

[29:50.940 --> 29:53.220]  Did I tell you guys about jet skis?
[29:54.080 --> 29:54.460]  No.
[29:54.680 --> 29:57.000]  No, you're going to tell us about some shit though, I think.
[29:57.300 --> 29:58.480]  Are you going to tell me the origin?
[30:00.720 --> 30:02.820]  Well, I'll talk about jet skis some other time.
[30:02.940 --> 30:03.540]  Jet skis are great.
[30:03.760 --> 30:04.720]  I just discovered jet skis.
[30:05.460 --> 30:06.140]  I just fucking...
[30:06.140 --> 30:10.120]  I just discovered that they're a thing I'd never been on before in my life.
[30:10.800 --> 30:12.660]  And it was so fucking cool.
[30:12.900 --> 30:13.580]  Oh my God.
[30:13.700 --> 30:14.560]  I don't...
[30:14.560 --> 30:15.240]  I don't...
[30:15.240 --> 30:16.360]  Dude, I don't fucking care.
[30:16.480 --> 30:19.700]  I want to get some wraparound Oakleys and a fucking girl mullet.
[30:19.780 --> 30:20.760]  And I just want to be like...
[30:20.760 --> 30:22.260]  I just want to be a jet ski lake trout.
[30:22.280 --> 30:26.060]  I want to be like Kenny Powers in Eastbound Down in a fucking tuxedo on a jet ski.
[30:26.580 --> 30:28.060]  The other day, Emily and I were...
[30:28.060 --> 30:28.740]  It was like on a Sunday.
[30:29.500 --> 30:31.060]  And we were sitting around and she goes,
[30:31.120 --> 30:32.520]  I'm kind of bored, do you want to do something?
[30:32.860 --> 30:34.400]  And I was like, yeah, yeah, let's do something.
[30:34.460 --> 30:36.200]  She goes, let's go ride jet skis.
[30:36.240 --> 30:37.760]  And I was like, A, I don't know how to do that.
[30:37.820 --> 30:38.860]  B, I've never ridden a jet ski.
[30:39.220 --> 30:40.880]  C, like, where would you even do that?
[30:41.200 --> 30:43.720]  And I'm like, yeah, if you can figure that out, sure, let's do it.
[30:43.720 --> 30:46.740]  Less than 20 minutes later, we were on jet skis.
[30:47.120 --> 30:49.440]  Right on the 360 bridge, Gavin.
[30:49.760 --> 30:51.420]  They rent them under the bridge.
[30:51.840 --> 30:52.680]  You fucking pay.
[30:52.800 --> 30:54.800]  You literally walk up, park your car, walk down.
[30:55.200 --> 30:56.700]  The damn thing is in the water.
[30:57.080 --> 30:58.260]  Some dude's like, here you go.
[30:58.380 --> 30:59.100]  Here's your safety briefing.
[30:59.240 --> 30:59.700]  Don't die.
[30:59.780 --> 31:00.460]  And you're like, thanks.
[31:00.640 --> 31:01.660]  And then I spent two hours...
[31:01.660 --> 31:02.740]  That doesn't sound like a business.
[31:02.880 --> 31:04.500]  It just sounds like a guy who owns a jet ski.
[31:04.660 --> 31:06.560]  He got 200 bucks off me real fast.
[31:07.040 --> 31:09.120]  And I rode jet skis for two...
[31:09.120 --> 31:09.840]  How much was a jet ski?
[31:10.440 --> 31:12.720]  They cost like 10 to 15 grand new.
[31:12.720 --> 31:14.340]  I looked them up because I want to buy one.
[31:14.980 --> 31:15.120]  Yeah.
[31:15.340 --> 31:15.860]  So anyway.
[31:16.120 --> 31:17.100]  So much more than I thought.
[31:17.500 --> 31:20.300]  Emily and I rode jet skis for two hours on like...
[31:20.300 --> 31:22.380]  We went from dam to dam under the bridge.
[31:22.440 --> 31:24.320]  Saw all the fucking craziest mansions.
[31:24.480 --> 31:25.520]  Everything was awesome.
[31:25.700 --> 31:26.900]  And it's the most...
[31:26.900 --> 31:28.360]  It's like a bicycle in the water.
[31:28.780 --> 31:29.920]  It's the most fun ever.
[31:30.020 --> 31:30.580]  No, it isn't.
[31:30.640 --> 31:32.400]  It's like your bicycle in the water.
[31:32.480 --> 31:33.960]  It's like my bicycle in the...
[31:33.960 --> 31:35.660]  It's like my bicycle in the water.
[31:35.900 --> 31:40.000]  And what's even better is it goes way faster.
[31:40.400 --> 31:40.980]  I was...
[31:40.980 --> 31:43.700]  We only rode one and then we rode...
[31:43.700 --> 31:45.940]  I went first and she rode on the back and then we switched.
[31:46.400 --> 31:48.940]  And I hit like 27 miles an hour.
[31:49.080 --> 31:49.880]  And I was like, holy shit.
[31:49.940 --> 31:51.340]  This is about as fast as I go on my bike.
[31:51.840 --> 31:52.480]  And that's dangerous.
[31:52.620 --> 31:53.640]  I better kick it back a notch.
[31:54.280 --> 31:55.080]  Emily got on.
[31:55.420 --> 31:56.280]  She goes, hold on.
[31:56.360 --> 31:56.960]  And I grabbed on her.
[31:57.000 --> 31:58.300]  She goes, no, hold on, asshole.
[31:58.400 --> 31:58.900]  And I go, what?
[31:58.980 --> 31:59.880]  And then she floored it.
[32:00.100 --> 32:02.360]  She did 55 miles an hour instantly.
[32:02.640 --> 32:05.080]  Like from zero to 55 miles an hour.
[32:05.140 --> 32:07.580]  I thought I was going to die.
[32:09.200 --> 32:10.380]  A, she's a psycho.
[32:10.380 --> 32:12.280]  And B, jet skis, man.
[32:12.480 --> 32:13.760]  We all got to buy jet skis.
[32:13.920 --> 32:14.400]  I had...
[32:14.400 --> 32:14.780]  I don't...
[32:14.780 --> 32:17.760]  I can't believe 46 years of my life without jet skis.
[32:17.840 --> 32:18.420]  Almost 46.
[32:18.700 --> 32:19.880]  It's fucking dumb.
[32:20.200 --> 32:21.620]  And I have wasted...
[32:21.620 --> 32:25.020]  I have wasted 45 years of my life not on a jet ski.
[32:25.380 --> 32:25.980]  That's all.
[32:26.160 --> 32:26.620]  Interesting.
[32:27.120 --> 32:28.440]  That was a good story, Geoff.
[32:28.920 --> 32:29.480]  I appreciate...
[32:29.480 --> 32:30.240]  That was a good one.
[32:30.800 --> 32:35.760]  Do you know that the jet ski was popularized by a James Bond movie?
[32:36.720 --> 32:37.940]  Uh, what?
[32:38.140 --> 32:38.620]  Thunderball?
[32:39.720 --> 32:40.760]  Yeah, something like that.
[32:40.900 --> 32:43.140]  It was like one of those Q gadgets.
[32:43.420 --> 32:44.600]  It's like, check this out.
[32:44.740 --> 32:46.580]  It's called the wet bike.
[32:47.180 --> 32:48.040]  It's just a jet ski.
[32:48.960 --> 32:50.540]  They became like just normal.
[32:50.920 --> 32:54.520]  But it was originally like a silly James Bond gadget.
[32:55.240 --> 32:56.020]  Well, I told you...
[32:56.340 --> 32:57.180]  It's a weird...
[32:57.180 --> 32:57.600]  Oh, go ahead.
[32:58.040 --> 33:00.800]  I was gonna say, I told you guys a good story about a happy time.
[33:02.060 --> 33:02.580]  A really...
[33:02.580 --> 33:06.680]  That was the most fun I've had in a long time.
[33:06.680 --> 33:10.240]  If you'd like, I can tell you the least fun I've had in a long time.
[33:10.820 --> 33:10.860]  Yes.
[33:11.680 --> 33:14.160]  This is when I texted you the other morning and I said,
[33:14.240 --> 33:16.660]  boy, do I have a 3 a.m. shit story for you guys?
[33:18.020 --> 33:18.460]  Yeah.
[33:20.860 --> 33:25.000]  Well, as I've told you before, I'm sure you know, my dog, Arrow,
[33:25.460 --> 33:28.480]  she does not sleep through the night, every night.
[33:29.640 --> 33:31.840]  So she's in a crate and she's older.
[33:31.960 --> 33:32.920]  You know, she's 14 now.
[33:33.300 --> 33:35.240]  And so she has accidents.
[33:35.240 --> 33:39.000]  And so I sleep literally like with half...
[33:39.640 --> 33:42.160]  I sleep with one eye open, essentially.
[33:42.300 --> 33:45.460]  Because I have to listen for Arrow in case she barks.
[33:45.560 --> 33:49.460]  Because if she barks, she's telling me she needs to be let out or she's gonna have an oopsie.
[33:49.960 --> 33:55.140]  And as everybody knows, a 50-pound dog having an oopsie in a crate with diarrhea
[33:56.200 --> 33:59.120]  means a day of cleaning.
[33:59.800 --> 34:03.160]  And so it's about 3.30 in the morning.
[34:04.060 --> 34:07.020]  Whatever fucking day I texted you guys, it had just happened.
[34:07.880 --> 34:10.500]  And it was like 3.30 in the morning and I hear Arrow bark.
[34:11.140 --> 34:13.160]  And I just once, I just hear her bark once.
[34:13.500 --> 34:15.160]  So I open my eyes and I go and I listen again.
[34:15.280 --> 34:16.240]  And I don't hear anything for a second.
[34:16.340 --> 34:18.300]  I go, well, better safe than sorry.
[34:18.360 --> 34:20.900]  I'm already awake and I'm pretty used to this game.
[34:21.740 --> 34:24.680]  And if you don't, if you're like, that's probably fine,
[34:24.680 --> 34:25.820]  then you're gonna live to regret it.
[34:25.980 --> 34:26.340]  Guaranteed.
[34:26.680 --> 34:29.440]  So I get up and I go, I open the doors into the hallway
[34:29.440 --> 34:32.240]  and I instantly get hit with the smell of dog shit.
[34:32.240 --> 34:34.020]  And I go, oh, fuck that.
[34:34.300 --> 34:35.020]  God damn it.
[34:35.060 --> 34:36.940]  She only barked once, Arrow.
[34:37.280 --> 34:40.380]  And so I go into the laundry room where her crate is.
[34:40.460 --> 34:43.360]  And I open it and it's like overpowering.
[34:43.920 --> 34:45.160]  I can tell it's a bad one.
[34:46.740 --> 34:48.420]  And it's like 3.30 in the morning.
[34:48.560 --> 34:49.580]  The house is pitch black.
[34:49.680 --> 34:51.360]  So I go and I open the crate.
[34:51.540 --> 34:54.840]  And as soon as I open the crate, Arrow jumps out, like leaps out.
[34:54.880 --> 34:57.740]  And I'm like, I can't have a dog covered in shit running around the house.
[34:58.100 --> 34:58.800]  That's a nightmare.
[34:58.980 --> 35:01.920]  So I grab her as she's coming out and kind of pick her up and hug her.
[35:01.920 --> 35:03.580]  And by the way, I am in...
[35:03.580 --> 35:05.100]  I'm just in a pair of boxer briefs.
[35:05.180 --> 35:07.380]  Like I have no shirt on, no pants or anything.
[35:07.500 --> 35:10.440]  I just have like a pair of red underwear on and I'm barefoot.
[35:10.580 --> 35:13.720]  And I pick her up and she's like squiggling and fighting me.
[35:13.900 --> 35:16.320]  And, you know, and I'm like, I carry her.
[35:16.400 --> 35:18.480]  I like fireman carrier kind of over to the door.
[35:18.660 --> 35:19.700]  I open the sliding glass door.
[35:19.820 --> 35:20.620]  I throw her out.
[35:20.700 --> 35:25.460]  I shut the sliding glass door, turn around and go, okay.
[35:25.520 --> 35:26.720]  I walk back into the room.
[35:26.800 --> 35:27.800]  I can kind of see from the moonlight.
[35:28.040 --> 35:29.420]  I can already tell there's shit on the floor.
[35:29.420 --> 35:36.720]  I'm like, oh, and I'm like, I'm like, uh, that kind of freeze for a second because,
[35:36.840 --> 35:37.880]  you know, you're like half asleep.
[35:37.880 --> 35:39.000]  It's 3 30 in the morning.
[35:39.260 --> 35:42.080]  You've got a lot going on and you're like, where do I start?
[35:42.120 --> 35:43.940]  So I go, okay, I just need cleaning supplies.
[35:44.280 --> 35:45.340]  So I walk into the kitchen.
[35:45.480 --> 35:46.200]  I open the cabinets.
[35:46.260 --> 35:47.520]  I can't find any cleaning supplies.
[35:47.740 --> 35:49.080]  I look through the drawers.
[35:49.300 --> 35:50.340]  I look around the sink.
[35:50.400 --> 35:51.580]  I go into Millie's bathroom.
[35:51.700 --> 35:52.620]  I find some cleaning supplies.
[35:52.700 --> 35:53.500]  I come back.
[35:54.480 --> 35:57.980]  I, uh, at this point, I'm starting to get a little lucid, you know?
[35:57.980 --> 36:03.840]  So I turn on the laundry room light and I realize it's way worse than I thought.
[36:04.040 --> 36:08.060]  And I realized that I'm also now, I look at myself.
[36:08.160 --> 36:10.640]  I realize I am covered in shit because Erin was covered in shit.
[36:10.760 --> 36:12.780]  So when I pick her up, I smothered her.
[36:12.780 --> 36:13.880]  She was all squiggly.
[36:14.180 --> 36:19.100]  I, I, I just, she and I just wriggled around in my arms and she just coated me,
[36:19.600 --> 36:21.080]  coated me in dog shit, right?
[36:21.420 --> 36:25.660]  So I'm like about to throw up and I like, and I look and the crate is a, is it's like
[36:25.660 --> 36:26.360]  a horror movie.
[36:26.360 --> 36:28.840]  It's like an Eli Roth horror movie, right?
[36:29.400 --> 36:33.400]  And so, uh, I, I take all the bedding out and I don't know where to put it.
[36:33.480 --> 36:35.420]  And I'm like, uh, I guess I'll just throw it outside right now.
[36:35.440 --> 36:39.160]  So I open the door and I run out cause there's like a outdoor, like a table that I can put
[36:39.160 --> 36:40.160]  it on and I run out.
[36:40.280 --> 36:43.700]  And as I'm stepping outside, I see Arrow and she looks weird.
[36:43.700 --> 36:44.440]  And it takes me a second.
[36:44.520 --> 36:46.440]  And then I realized, oh, she's weird cause she's wet.
[36:46.720 --> 36:48.380]  It's pouring rain.
[36:48.900 --> 36:50.860]  Like I was so half asleep and it was dark.
[36:50.900 --> 36:51.640]  I didn't realize it was raining.
[36:51.640 --> 36:56.960]  So now I'm holding, uh, Arrow's like crate bedding, uh, like memory foam crate bedding
[36:56.960 --> 36:57.780]  and it's covered in shit.
[36:57.880 --> 36:59.520]  And now it's covered in pools of shit.
[36:59.620 --> 37:03.960]  And I realized I'm looking at me and there's like, I'm getting soaked and there's just
[37:03.960 --> 37:08.280]  like shit slopping off of my arm and my leg and I'm like, just like soaked.
[37:08.400 --> 37:10.400]  And I look at Arrow and she's soaked and we're both covered in shit.
[37:10.480 --> 37:14.300]  So I stick that stuff there and then I like try to shake as much shit off as I can.
[37:14.640 --> 37:17.040]  And I, and I leave Arrow outside cause I can't deal with that right now.
[37:17.160 --> 37:17.840]  I shut the door.
[37:17.920 --> 37:21.200]  I go back in and I start cleaning up the floor, you know, and I'm cleaning up and I'm cleaning
[37:21.200 --> 37:25.120]  up and I'm going through so many paper towels and then I'm like, I'm like filling a trash bag.
[37:25.940 --> 37:27.280]  And every time I turn around, there's more shit.
[37:27.580 --> 37:30.780]  And then I realized that there's shit on my foot and I've been dragging shit around.
[37:30.880 --> 37:34.280]  And then I realized if I drug shit, if I'm dragging shit around this hallway,
[37:34.480 --> 37:36.340]  I must have drug it into the kitchen.
[37:36.640 --> 37:38.140]  I must have drug it into Millie's bathroom.
[37:38.240 --> 37:42.460]  So sure enough, not only was I, I, there is shit on the counter.
[37:42.640 --> 37:44.100]  It's on the, it's on the drawer.
[37:44.160 --> 37:46.260]  It's on the door where I got the cleaning supplies out.
[37:46.300 --> 37:47.020]  It's in the hallway.
[37:47.200 --> 37:48.240]  It's in Millie's bathroom.
[37:48.240 --> 37:54.160]  So 15 minutes later, I have now cleaned up all the shit that I can find that I tracked,
[37:54.260 --> 37:55.340]  that the dog, the dog didn't track.
[37:55.460 --> 37:57.020]  I tracked all throughout the house.
[37:57.080 --> 38:02.980]  Right. And I'm sopping wet and I'm miserable and Arrow's outside barking and I'm scared
[38:02.980 --> 38:05.720]  she's going to wake up the neighbors and I finally get it all cleaned up.
[38:05.780 --> 38:07.080]  And then I go and I'm like, okay.
[38:07.840 --> 38:11.760]  I'm just imagining you looking like you just escaped short-term prison.
[38:11.760 --> 38:12.960]  Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[38:13.340 --> 38:15.660]  At what point did you become Andy Dufresne?
[38:15.940 --> 38:17.820]  I wish it wasn't going to get worse, but it is.
[38:18.900 --> 38:23.680]  So I will, I go back into the hallway and I'm like, well, I guess now I'll go get Arrow
[38:24.840 --> 38:26.440]  and deal with that.
[38:26.700 --> 38:28.740]  And I look and we have a rug in the hallway.
[38:29.100 --> 38:33.640]  And of course, the rug is, it's next to the, it's like a 10 foot long rug that covers the
[38:33.640 --> 38:35.720]  hallway and it's next to the sliding glass doors to go outside.
[38:36.200 --> 38:39.020]  And it is, Waffle stomped into it.
[38:39.360 --> 38:42.600]  I hadn't been back in there since I let the bedding outside.
[38:42.700 --> 38:47.600]  Waffle stomped into it, it's just like piles of the dog shit with dog footprints and my
[38:47.600 --> 38:49.680]  just smushed into the rug, right?
[38:51.060 --> 38:54.720]  So luckily I, this has happened in the past.
[38:54.940 --> 39:00.400]  So we had a nice rug there that we put in storage and I bought this thing called a
[39:00.400 --> 39:02.100]  ruggable, which is like, it looks like a rug.
[39:02.220 --> 39:04.980]  It's on Velcro and then you rip it up and then you can stick it in the washing machine
[39:04.980 --> 39:05.520]  and it's fine.
[39:06.320 --> 39:08.760]  It's a fucking lifesaver if you have dogs that shit everywhere.
[39:10.360 --> 39:14.560]  And so I'm like, well, I guess I better rip up the ruggable and start to put that in the
[39:14.560 --> 39:14.700]  watch.
[39:14.720 --> 39:15.640]  So I rip up the ruggable.
[39:16.020 --> 39:20.040]  So I've got like this 10 foot rug that's Velcro and covered in shit, right?
[39:20.180 --> 39:21.680]  And I'm trying to like bundle that up.
[39:22.420 --> 39:25.000]  And then I think I should just throw this in the washer right now.
[39:25.220 --> 39:29.060]  So I walk over to the washing machine and I open it and in the washer is, and then it
[39:29.060 --> 39:29.460]  hits me.
[39:30.120 --> 39:32.240]  Earlier that night, Emily and I went on a date.
[39:32.320 --> 39:35.940]  It was our first date in a while and she had a brand new dress and it was this cotton
[39:36.640 --> 39:39.060]  dress and she had bought it for the date.
[39:39.160 --> 39:39.940]  It was beautiful.
[39:40.260 --> 39:41.240]  She looked beautiful.
[39:41.360 --> 39:42.520]  It was really cute.
[39:43.140 --> 39:49.220]  I just, just, it was just a vision of loveliness and she was putting on makeup and she walks
[39:49.220 --> 39:51.500]  out of the, she like is just put the dress on.
[39:51.720 --> 39:54.620]  She's like putting on makeup and she bumps into something and she drops her makeup brush
[39:54.620 --> 39:58.120]  and it drops this, the brush goes all the way down the front of her dress with brown
[39:58.120 --> 39:58.760]  makeup everywhere.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.720]  So we had like put Shout on it immediately and shoved it in the washer and washed it.
[40:02.940 --> 40:06.160]  So I look at that dress and then I look at me and I think there's no way I can touch
[40:06.160 --> 40:06.700]  this dress.
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.740]  I'm going to cover this dress in shit.
[40:08.980 --> 40:11.380]  I've got to be, there's got to be shit on me still.
[40:11.380 --> 40:14.840]  So I bundle up the rug and I kind of set it aside and try to out of the way.
[40:14.960 --> 40:17.440]  And then I'm like, well, I got to get clean the dog.
[40:17.460 --> 40:18.540]  I got to get the dog clean.
[40:18.680 --> 40:20.680]  So I had extra bedding for the dog.
[40:20.760 --> 40:24.160]  So I, I remake her bed, uh, get it set up for her that she'll have a place to stay.
[40:24.220 --> 40:29.280]  And then I go outside in the fucking rain and I washed the dog and I washed myself with
[40:29.280 --> 40:32.120]  dog shampoo, just like I'm Gavin using dog shampoo.
[40:32.340 --> 40:36.620]  And I washed the dog and I washed me at four in the morning, in the moonlight, in the dark,
[40:36.700 --> 40:37.320]  in my underwear.
[40:38.480 --> 40:40.860]  And then I don't have a towel and it's wet outside.
[40:40.980 --> 40:44.280]  So I leave arrow out there and I come back in and I dry myself off.
[40:44.380 --> 40:48.820]  And then I go in and I go in and I, and I get the dress and I'm whole and I get a hanger
[40:48.820 --> 40:50.200]  and I, cause I can't dry it.
[40:50.220 --> 40:51.200]  So I hang the dress.
[40:51.260 --> 40:51.900]  I don't know what else to do with it.
[40:51.940 --> 40:54.340]  I'm walking through the hallway with it in front of me.
[40:54.340 --> 40:55.960]  Like it's fucking radioactive, right?
[40:55.960 --> 40:58.940]  Because I don't want, I don't want it to come anywhere near me or a wall or anything.
[40:58.960 --> 41:03.140]  Because if there ends up, if I get shit on this dress in the morning, I'm going to fucking
[41:03.140 --> 41:03.980]  kill myself, right?
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.380]  Like a game of all of this.
[41:05.380 --> 41:07.600]  After all, I'd like a game of operation after all of this.
[41:07.800 --> 41:09.680]  And I'm slapping because I'm covered.
[41:09.960 --> 41:13.300]  My underwear is hanging off of me because it's all soaked with water.
[41:13.600 --> 41:16.320]  So my butt's hanging out and I just look at I'm a fucking mess.
[41:16.380 --> 41:19.200]  My hair's on my eyes and the ground's going like slap, slap, slap.
[41:20.360 --> 41:24.560]  And right at this fucking moment, Emily opens up the bedroom doors and goes,
[41:25.160 --> 41:26.020]  why are you doing laundry?
[41:26.320 --> 41:27.480]  What the fuck is going on?
[41:27.920 --> 41:32.080]  And I look at her and I look at the dress and I look at me and I go, go away.
[41:32.380 --> 41:33.260]  Leave me alone.
[41:33.560 --> 41:34.820]  Just go back to bed.
[41:34.820 --> 41:36.120]  Get out of here.
[41:36.420 --> 41:37.560]  And she goes, whatever.
[41:37.780 --> 41:41.740]  And she turns and goes back to bed and I hang up the dress and then I put that stuff in the
[41:41.740 --> 41:43.040]  laundry and I get the laundry going.
[41:43.260 --> 41:46.960]  Then I get I go outside to dry air off, but it's still fucking pouring rain.
[41:47.040 --> 41:47.900]  So I can't do that.
[41:48.120 --> 41:52.440]  So I bring her in and the second she gets in, she fucking shakes every bit of water
[41:52.440 --> 41:53.060]  off of her, right?
[41:53.260 --> 41:55.800]  And we're in this tiny little in this tiny little hallway.
[41:56.060 --> 42:01.000]  So now the wall and the ceiling are covered in water and mud and the sliding glass doors
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.280]  are now obviously streaky and covered in mud.
[42:03.280 --> 42:05.560]  So then I spend I put her I dry her off.
[42:05.640 --> 42:11.300]  I put her in a crate and then I go and I and I spend another 10 minutes with towels
[42:11.300 --> 42:16.080]  drying the ceiling and the walls and the floor and the sliding glass door.
[42:16.560 --> 42:18.340]  And then I put all that in the laundry room.
[42:18.460 --> 42:19.340]  I look at my watch.
[42:19.440 --> 42:20.420]  It's like 4.15.
[42:20.580 --> 42:22.420]  I've been doing this for 45 minutes.
[42:22.460 --> 42:25.040]  I go into the shower in my bathroom.
[42:25.220 --> 42:29.580]  I turn off all the lights in the bathroom and I take a steaming hot shower in the dark and
[42:29.580 --> 42:33.940]  I wash my entire body until it feels like I'm on fire from scrubbing so hard.
[42:34.100 --> 42:38.540]  And then I go into bed and I lay down and I put my head on the pillow and all I can
[42:38.540 --> 42:39.240]  smell is shit.
[42:39.700 --> 42:41.620]  And Emily goes, what's wrong?
[42:41.820 --> 42:44.700]  And I just started crying and I cried.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.260]  I literally cried myself to sleep.
[42:48.760 --> 42:49.560]  Oh, no!
[42:52.160 --> 42:54.940]  I like that Andrew didn't want to get white powder on his white ceiling.
[42:55.060 --> 43:06.000]  I don't understand how a guy who is almost 46 years old, who is relatively successful
[43:06.000 --> 43:06.700]  in life.
[43:06.900 --> 43:11.220]  I was fortunate enough to have to be able to help start a company that's gone on.
[43:11.320 --> 43:12.860]  I get to do what I love for a living.
[43:13.220 --> 43:15.800]  I don't have to worry about the bills or anything.
[43:15.900 --> 43:17.200]  I'm in a good place in life.
[43:17.200 --> 43:25.460]  Yet somehow, my life is so covered in literal shit at all times.
[43:25.560 --> 43:27.380]  How do I escape feces?
[43:28.800 --> 43:30.820]  I can't get away from it.
[43:31.520 --> 43:33.380]  I love the...
[43:33.380 --> 43:35.560]  Like, you texted us.
[43:35.620 --> 43:36.520]  I went back to the text.
[43:36.680 --> 43:40.240]  You texted us, boy, do I have a 3am shit story for you guys on Thursday.
[43:40.920 --> 43:44.600]  The word to pain ratio is phenomenal.
[43:45.040 --> 43:46.880]  Like, I looked at that and I was like, that'll be interesting.
[43:46.880 --> 43:48.180]  What a horrible experience.
[43:48.340 --> 43:51.060]  You are a different person than you were since that point.
[43:51.560 --> 43:53.120]  That is an experience that would change you.
[43:53.360 --> 43:54.480]  Yeah, that was traumatizing.
[43:55.300 --> 43:56.020]  That's awful.
[43:57.080 --> 44:01.320]  I mean, it's just like the whole time I'm laying in bed crying and thinking about how
[44:01.320 --> 44:02.320]  unfair it is, right?
[44:02.360 --> 44:03.740]  Like how unfair life is.
[44:04.280 --> 44:08.060]  And how I'm like, and I'm just laying there going like, will there ever be a day when
[44:08.060 --> 44:09.480]  I don't have to clean up?
[44:09.760 --> 44:14.120]  When I don't literally have to clean up other people's shit every day, you know?
[44:14.240 --> 44:16.120]  And I've seen you clean up.
[44:16.120 --> 44:19.560]  I've seen you clean up lots of stuff, but you're at a disadvantage now.
[44:19.680 --> 44:23.560]  There was that time where, I think we've talked about it on our f***ing face, where your freezer
[44:23.560 --> 44:27.060]  turned off and you had to clean out rotting meat for like an hour and a half.
[44:27.200 --> 44:27.700]  A full cow.
[44:27.920 --> 44:32.740]  But at least, yeah, at least back then though, you just went in and like grabbed an entire
[44:32.740 --> 44:35.040]  six pack and threw it on the ground and just started drinking.
[44:35.240 --> 44:36.240]  You don't have that anymore.
[44:36.640 --> 44:39.940]  You have to do this entirely sober and it's just feces.
[44:41.020 --> 44:44.780]  And the whole time I'm laying in bed crying and whining to myself that it's not fair.
[44:44.780 --> 44:47.200]  I'm just thinking like, again? Really?
[44:48.240 --> 44:51.720]  Like, why does this keep... what am I doing wrong?
[44:51.780 --> 44:55.680]  And I think a part of the sadness must be that, you know, it's not the last time you're
[44:55.680 --> 44:56.040]  going to do that.
[44:56.120 --> 45:00.060]  No, dude, I don't know that it's not going to happen again tomorrow.
[45:00.380 --> 45:04.620]  It's like every night I go to bed and I lay my head on the pillow.
[45:04.920 --> 45:12.840]  I think like, is this what... what horrors await me four hours from now?
[45:12.900 --> 45:13.400]  I don't know.
[45:13.780 --> 45:15.960]  Can you get little night nappies for dogs?
[45:16.480 --> 45:17.200]  Little diapies?
[45:18.280 --> 45:20.080]  If it wasn't this, it'd be something else.
[45:20.280 --> 45:22.120]  You know, it's just it's always something.
[45:22.740 --> 45:23.640]  It's just... ugh.
[45:23.800 --> 45:27.820]  Anyway, so that was... that was... that's how... that's how I sleep.
[45:28.680 --> 45:30.000]  Well, hey, you know what, Geoff?
[45:30.040 --> 45:31.100]  You found jet skis.
[45:31.460 --> 45:32.200]  That's in your life.
[45:32.320 --> 45:33.880]  That's the new light in your life.
[45:33.980 --> 45:34.740]  That's the balance.
[45:34.800 --> 45:36.020]  That's the counter to the dark.
[45:36.400 --> 45:37.320]  You have jet skis.
[45:37.420 --> 45:38.480]  Well, here's the problem.
[45:38.880 --> 45:43.020]  Here, you know, now that I bring up the jet ski thing, I realize I may have been a little
[45:43.760 --> 45:49.180]  a little presumptuous in claiming no no fault in the rain.
[45:49.760 --> 45:53.800]  I have wanted to ride a jet ski every day since we rode jet skis, and it has rained
[45:54.380 --> 45:57.020]  pretty much now that I'm putting two and two together here, Andrew.
[45:57.120 --> 45:59.380]  Now that you said that, I have literally... I wanted...
[45:59.380 --> 46:01.680]  We were supposed to ride jet skis yesterday, and it rained.
[46:01.680 --> 46:02.460]  I don't think...
[46:02.460 --> 46:04.960]  I might be in the fucking jet skis again!
[46:05.840 --> 46:07.000]  It's a Geoff thing.
[46:07.220 --> 46:09.720]  It's a Geoff in... it's a Geoff in what thing?
[46:09.860 --> 46:10.780]  It's a Geoff in the something.
[46:11.920 --> 46:14.920]  God! I just want to have fun!
[46:16.260 --> 46:18.140]  I have a question about jet skis.
[46:18.560 --> 46:23.820]  You know how they just fly along, but they also shoot out that little stream of piss
[46:23.820 --> 46:24.320]  out the back.
[46:24.540 --> 46:24.640]  Yeah.
[46:24.740 --> 46:26.800]  Is that for a function, or is that to look cool?
[46:27.100 --> 46:27.520]  No clue.
[46:28.020 --> 46:29.220]  Mine didn't have the jets.
[46:29.300 --> 46:30.620]  They don't all do this spray out.
[46:30.660 --> 46:31.180]  Oh, okay.
[46:31.260 --> 46:31.960]  Mine didn't have that.
[46:32.460 --> 46:33.120]  So I don't know.
[46:33.200 --> 46:36.260]  But Emily did point out... she's like, why does theirs do that and ours doesn't?
[46:36.380 --> 46:37.080]  No, no clue.
[46:37.260 --> 46:38.880]  I assume that there's a reason for it.
[46:39.280 --> 46:40.240]  Yeah, I can't think of it, though.
[46:41.320 --> 46:42.120]  I don't know, man.
[46:43.700 --> 46:47.640]  I'm just realizing now that the only way I'll ever be able to find out is to jet ski again.
[46:47.720 --> 46:50.600]  And the only way I'm going to be able to jet ski again in Austin is on accident.
[46:51.420 --> 46:53.560]  Why do jet skis piss?
[46:56.440 --> 46:57.780]  I did the same thing.
[46:57.860 --> 47:01.060]  I went to search, why does water in the autofill shoot out of my mouth?
[47:01.220 --> 47:03.100]  Which seems like a completely other problem.
[47:03.980 --> 47:05.280]  Wait, what were people asking?
[47:05.420 --> 47:06.740]  They didn't know why water was coming out of their mouth?
[47:06.740 --> 47:10.440]  I guess when I filled out, when I read it, why does water shoot out?
[47:10.520 --> 47:12.000]  The top thing was out of my mouth.
[47:14.520 --> 47:16.320]  I've had a forum post question.
[47:16.780 --> 47:18.100]  Why do jet skis pee?
[47:18.340 --> 47:22.560]  The first answer is no idea, but it's my main reason for not wanting one.
[47:24.140 --> 47:28.080]  Oh, apparently it's a visibility spout.
[47:28.920 --> 47:29.380]  Really?
[47:30.300 --> 47:34.140]  I feel like the actual jet ski is way more noticeable than the white mist coming out
[47:34.140 --> 47:34.600]  the back of it.
[47:34.900 --> 47:36.320]  Yeah, I'd agree with that.
[47:36.320 --> 47:42.440]  If you don't see the jet ski, if Emily's driving and I'm in the back, you definitely hear me going.
[47:47.540 --> 47:50.380]  I think you've had your one good experience with a jet ski.
[47:50.520 --> 47:54.080]  I think you should call it a day there, because the more you do something,
[47:54.360 --> 47:55.840]  I feel like the worse you get at it.
[47:55.980 --> 47:58.240]  You get confident, but you don't build up any skill.
[47:58.300 --> 48:01.120]  It's like the time you flip through the air on that Vespa.
[48:03.220 --> 48:05.160]  It's only going to happen on a jet ski.
[48:05.160 --> 48:06.080]  Oh, man.
[48:07.480 --> 48:08.280]  Oh, yeah.
[48:08.560 --> 48:10.240]  Yeah, you're probably right about that.
[48:10.400 --> 48:11.800]  I should leave well enough alone.
[48:11.980 --> 48:15.400]  Also, I just, I mean, my bamboo appreciates the rain.
[48:16.040 --> 48:16.460]  It's got to fight.
[48:16.540 --> 48:19.760]  It's got to come back from the fucking apocalypse we had.
[48:20.320 --> 48:25.240]  But I just, I gotta stop making plans.
[48:25.460 --> 48:26.280]  I, fuck, man.
[48:26.300 --> 48:29.220]  I thought I was in the clear for this until Andrew put two and two together for me.
[48:29.220 --> 48:30.060]  This is really annoying.
[48:30.720 --> 48:33.900]  How would you feel about a day off plan the next time it's sunny?
[48:34.420 --> 48:34.820]  Okay.
[48:35.800 --> 48:38.000]  Now, do you think that'll prevent it becoming sunny again?
[48:38.080 --> 48:40.620]  The fact that the universe now knows about our spontaneous plan?
[48:41.020 --> 48:41.500]  I don't know.
[48:41.600 --> 48:42.180]  It's interesting.
[48:42.620 --> 48:43.100]  It's interesting.
[48:43.780 --> 48:48.000]  It's funny you say that because Jack invited me to something this weekend.
[48:48.180 --> 48:50.720]  And then I thought, well, that's a sure sign that it's going to rain.
[48:51.260 --> 48:54.280]  So I don't even know that we could do a day in, day of.
[48:56.780 --> 48:58.560]  Is Jack still a superfan?
[48:58.740 --> 48:59.240]  Did he retire?
[48:59.980 --> 49:00.900]  He's not retired.
[49:00.980 --> 49:01.880]  He's fighting his way back.
[49:02.360 --> 49:02.780]  Oh, okay.
[49:02.780 --> 49:05.620]  He's a really good fan.
[49:05.800 --> 49:06.060]  Yeah?
[49:06.480 --> 49:07.540]  Yeah, he's a...
[49:07.540 --> 49:10.520]  I don't know that I would declare him a superfan again just yet.
[49:10.520 --> 49:10.580]  I see.
[49:10.720 --> 49:12.520]  On the chart, he's on the way there.
[49:12.740 --> 49:12.880]  Yeah.
[49:13.040 --> 49:16.660]  I'm on jet ski message boards right now, trying to go deeper into this.
[49:17.040 --> 49:20.740]  I really appreciate somebody just calling it the vertical pisser, which is great.
[49:21.240 --> 49:23.880]  People try to figure out how to disable their vertical pisser.
[49:24.300 --> 49:25.540]  Appears to be a term.
[49:25.720 --> 49:27.900]  Have either of you ever ridden a jet ski?
[49:28.320 --> 49:29.780]  No, I have not.
[49:29.780 --> 49:33.860]  I've seen Macho Man got knocked out by one.
[49:34.060 --> 49:35.660]  Macho Man or Hulk Hogan?
[49:36.020 --> 49:36.920]  I think it was Macho Man.
[49:37.160 --> 49:40.740]  There's a great Baywatch episode with wrestlers, and it's fantastic.
[49:41.080 --> 49:44.740]  Did you ever see the video of Kanye hitting the beach and throwing Kim off the fucking jet ski?
[49:45.140 --> 49:45.580]  No.
[49:45.740 --> 49:46.560]  Oh, my God.
[49:46.620 --> 49:47.280]  Are you serious?
[49:47.760 --> 49:48.560]  Oh, my God.
[49:48.620 --> 49:49.080]  Hold on.
[49:49.200 --> 49:50.180]  I will find it.
[49:50.880 --> 49:52.060]  I'd love to see that.
[49:52.300 --> 49:53.740]  Because it's like, it's crazy.
[49:53.840 --> 49:57.600]  And then you realize it's two fucking billionaires doing it.
[49:57.600 --> 49:59.240]  And you're like, oh, my God.
[50:00.180 --> 50:05.080]  My favorite, like, weird Kanye thing is when he showed his game at, like, some, I think he was,
[50:05.180 --> 50:06.920]  like, debuting a new album.
[50:07.240 --> 50:10.140]  And he showed a trailer for the game he was developing at the time.
[50:10.360 --> 50:11.860]  And people didn't cheer enough.
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.120]  And he yelled at them for it.
[50:13.160 --> 50:16.000]  And then made them play the trailer again so people could cheer appropriately.
[50:16.500 --> 50:16.980]  It's great.
[50:17.360 --> 50:19.020]  He's like, video games are fucking hard.
[50:19.060 --> 50:20.060]  You guys don't get it.
[50:20.120 --> 50:21.460]  You need to appreciate this shit.
[50:21.540 --> 50:22.520]  This shit's amazing.
[50:23.020 --> 50:26.920]  And he just ran the trailer back so people could cheer louder the second time.
[50:27.420 --> 50:27.940]  It's great.
[50:28.320 --> 50:28.620]  There you go.
[50:29.040 --> 50:29.780]  Watch this video.
[50:29.980 --> 50:30.040]  Okay.
[50:32.400 --> 50:37.020]  Any YouTube video that has raw HD video in the title is always great.
[50:39.620 --> 50:40.740]  Holy shit.
[50:41.240 --> 50:43.880]  Yeah, that's Kim hitting the ground right there.
[50:44.400 --> 50:46.320]  Why did he do that?
[50:46.640 --> 50:47.420]  I don't know.
[50:49.800 --> 50:51.100]  Is that really them?
[50:51.280 --> 50:52.900]  Yeah, that's a famous clip.
[50:53.980 --> 50:54.860]  I'm gonna watch that again.
[50:55.620 --> 50:56.860]  He almost killed that woman.
[50:57.140 --> 50:57.380]  Yeah.
[50:58.100 --> 50:59.320]  He damn sure did.
[51:07.500 --> 51:09.080]  They get some height.
[51:09.180 --> 51:10.680]  That's like probably falling off a roof.
[51:10.900 --> 51:11.340]  Oh yeah.
[51:13.360 --> 51:17.740]  I think the thing about jet skis is they're clearly a lot more dangerous than they look.
[51:19.980 --> 51:26.280]  I think we need to have a f*** face jet ski party next time Andrew's in Texas.
[51:26.760 --> 51:28.420]  We can finally all be together.
[51:28.420 --> 51:30.840]  We're gonna have the most fun.
[51:31.060 --> 51:33.920]  Do you connect with the Tiger King guy on a whole other level now?
[51:34.020 --> 51:35.880]  Are you bonded with that man in a new way?
[51:36.540 --> 51:40.040]  I'm embracing my inner Alabama finally after all these years.
[51:40.340 --> 51:42.300]  I'm telling you, I get it.
[51:42.360 --> 51:43.580]  It's f***ing fun.
[51:44.080 --> 51:48.180]  It almost makes up for all the times in life you have to clean up shit.
[51:48.620 --> 51:55.060]  As it gets crusted into your body hair and into the crevices of your body so that you
[51:55.060 --> 52:00.340]  have to take a scalding hot 4am shower just to try to cleanse yourself.
[52:00.620 --> 52:03.720]  I can imagine getting myself into a situation...
[52:03.720 --> 52:08.240]  Remember that GoPro video of the guy on the speedboat with all the people around him?
[52:08.400 --> 52:10.740]  And they all just get smashed around.
[52:11.220 --> 52:12.580]  It's one of the most brutal...
[52:13.220 --> 52:13.760]  It's weird.
[52:14.640 --> 52:19.140]  It's in a realm where you want to look at it and it's a little bit funny,
[52:19.300 --> 52:23.940]  but then you realize that everyone on the boat got seriously injured.
[52:23.940 --> 52:26.620]  And it was probably the worst day of all of their lives.
[52:28.420 --> 52:33.260]  It's a brutal video, but it's just so fascinating to watch from a locked-off perspective.
[52:33.400 --> 52:34.840]  People just getting rattled around.
[52:34.940 --> 52:36.820]  You can't really even see what happened to the boat.
[52:37.240 --> 52:39.120]  It looks like they're in a washing machine.
[52:39.700 --> 52:45.700]  Do we know if the Kim Kanye jet ski video is that before or after the Bound 2 music video?
[52:46.160 --> 52:48.400]  Because it really changes the context of that.
[52:49.600 --> 52:55.260]  Well, yeah, it's just like the whole concept of her positioning on that bike that he's driving.
[52:55.440 --> 52:58.520]  It's a different context within this video.
[52:58.720 --> 53:02.220]  It is hard for me to imagine that this happened and then they made that video.
[53:02.480 --> 53:06.480]  I feel like the Bound 2 video almost certainly was before this happened.
[53:07.020 --> 53:13.340]  I do not see Kim Kardashian being in any vehicle with Kanye West after this incident,
[53:13.600 --> 53:14.840]  especially where he's driving.
[53:16.760 --> 53:18.820]  Oh, all I can see is the Bound 2 now.
[53:19.420 --> 53:21.940]  I don't know. He like, he cranks it up.
[53:23.400 --> 53:24.420]  Oh, god damn.
[53:24.440 --> 53:26.160]  It's just like a great moment in time.
[53:26.260 --> 53:29.160]  There was a time where they were both in the air flying off a jet ski.
[53:29.560 --> 53:34.900]  Just like there was another great moment in time where light left the sun, flew across space,
[53:35.140 --> 53:39.120]  bounced off the moon, bounced to earth, bounced off some dog shit and into Geoff's eyes.
[53:39.380 --> 53:41.860]  And that's another great moment in time.
[53:45.720 --> 53:46.640]  What a journey.
[53:51.440 --> 53:54.060]  Anything shitty happened to either of you guys recently?
[53:54.720 --> 53:56.100]  Oh, no, nothing like that.
[53:56.260 --> 53:57.980]  No, I mean, that's a whole other level.
[53:58.140 --> 54:00.020]  I'm just all the like, touch the sky.
[54:00.180 --> 54:01.960]  There's so many great Kanye connections.
[54:04.260 --> 54:05.060]  It's fantastic.
[54:06.520 --> 54:07.340]  I can't say.
[54:07.420 --> 54:10.280]  OK, so I had one thing happen to me and you guys have seen the photo for it,
[54:10.280 --> 54:12.360]  but there isn't there isn't context for it.
[54:12.480 --> 54:13.440]  This happened last week.
[54:13.580 --> 54:14.380]  I didn't mention it.
[54:15.260 --> 54:17.140]  I talked to Geoff about this.
[54:17.480 --> 54:19.620]  I have made a life changing realization.
[54:20.320 --> 54:21.460]  It's a big change.
[54:21.540 --> 54:22.040]  It's great.
[54:22.460 --> 54:24.600]  I would strongly recommend anybody do this.
[54:25.620 --> 54:27.800]  I used it when I would make hash browns.
[54:27.800 --> 54:28.460]  I'd use butter.
[54:29.980 --> 54:31.540]  This is a game changer, Gavin.
[54:31.600 --> 54:32.200]  Don't fucking laugh.
[54:32.280 --> 54:33.520]  This is a serious business.
[54:33.920 --> 54:35.220]  I have recently switched.
[54:35.580 --> 54:36.700]  The pan was too hot.
[54:36.920 --> 54:39.300]  I was like, if I put butter in there, it's just going to burn immediately.
[54:39.420 --> 54:40.040]  What do I do?
[54:40.160 --> 54:41.480]  Put in some olive oil.
[54:41.920 --> 54:43.780]  Greatest cook of hash browns I've ever had.
[54:44.300 --> 54:44.700]  Fantastic.
[54:44.920 --> 54:47.200]  I've switched from butter to olive oil.
[54:47.460 --> 54:48.620]  It's a great mix.
[54:48.960 --> 54:53.300]  So you're making hash browns from scratch or you're just like heating them up?
[54:53.300 --> 54:55.440]  I like frozen hash browns.
[54:55.480 --> 54:57.660]  Throw them in a pan, throw them in a skillet, whatever.
[54:58.080 --> 54:58.580]  Cook them up.
[54:58.640 --> 55:02.460]  But I always use butter and the butter would burn and you wouldn't get a good crisp on the hash.
[55:02.560 --> 55:03.820]  You want a crunch on it.
[55:04.140 --> 55:05.180]  So I've switched to oil.
[55:05.300 --> 55:06.680]  I can cook it at a higher temp.
[55:06.880 --> 55:08.260]  I get a better crust.
[55:08.700 --> 55:10.760]  It has been a game changer in the thing.
[55:10.760 --> 55:12.140]  Like Geoff and jet skis.
[55:12.240 --> 55:15.980]  I feel like I've wasted 20 years of my life cooking hash browns with butter.
[55:16.060 --> 55:17.120]  Which huge mistake.
[55:17.500 --> 55:23.780]  This illustrates, by the way, you know, I'm always interested in how we interact individually in our
[55:23.780 --> 55:25.780]  friendships, like in pairs, right?
[55:25.940 --> 55:28.520]  And you guys have your halo bets and stuff.
[55:29.760 --> 55:31.340]  Andrew's reminding me of this conversation.
[55:31.540 --> 55:38.000]  Andrew and I apparently have very long, very dry conversations about which oil
[55:38.600 --> 55:39.900]  smokes at which temperature.
[55:40.300 --> 55:41.860]  And what is the best cooking oil?
[55:42.240 --> 55:43.480]  We had a smoke points.
[55:43.540 --> 55:51.380]  We're talking about smoke points of like safflower oil versus peanut oil versus avocado oil versus
[55:51.380 --> 55:53.640]  olive oil versus canola oil.
[55:54.060 --> 55:56.960]  Like that was like that must have been a two hour conversation.
[55:57.100 --> 55:57.740]  Andrew and I had.
[55:57.860 --> 56:02.360]  So you're talking level of excitement similar to the conversation about what you saw out your
[56:02.360 --> 56:03.200]  window last week.
[56:03.400 --> 56:03.680]  Yeah.
[56:03.980 --> 56:04.160]  Yeah.
[56:04.180 --> 56:05.460]  This is what I get from him.
[56:05.640 --> 56:05.760]  Yeah.
[56:05.900 --> 56:07.040]  No, this is what we had.
[56:07.040 --> 56:11.340]  It was a realization that the smoke point is like the culinary equivalent of miles per
[56:11.340 --> 56:11.600]  hour.
[56:11.740 --> 56:13.960]  You want a high smoke point like that's what you're looking for.
[56:14.240 --> 56:15.340]  I'm excited about it.
[56:15.500 --> 56:18.520]  And avocado oil was the number one and I've never used it.
[56:18.620 --> 56:19.900]  Geoff suggested avocado oil.
[56:20.040 --> 56:21.100]  I didn't even know that was a thing.
[56:21.400 --> 56:23.360]  I haven't done it yet, but I'm excited to try it.
[56:23.660 --> 56:27.680]  But anyway, it was late one evening and I was like, you know what?
[56:27.760 --> 56:29.880]  Fucking I'm just going to let's make some hash browns.
[56:29.940 --> 56:31.160]  I feel like having a good morning.
[56:31.340 --> 56:32.960]  Let's start this day off right.
[56:33.540 --> 56:35.520]  I'm going to make some hash browns in the fridge.
[56:35.520 --> 56:39.160]  I pull them out and they're shredded hash browns.
[56:39.240 --> 56:42.120]  And the entire thing is a fucking block of ice.
[56:42.480 --> 56:45.500]  It's just, you know, like where the ice freezes over the potato or whatever.
[56:45.740 --> 56:46.540]  It's like an iceberg.
[56:46.720 --> 56:47.240]  It's huge.
[56:47.500 --> 56:49.580]  And I'm trying to break it in half.
[56:49.660 --> 56:51.320]  I can't figure out what to do with the ice.
[56:51.720 --> 56:53.440]  And so I'm pounding it with a knife.
[56:53.820 --> 56:55.800]  But then that's putting holes in the bag.
[56:55.880 --> 56:57.940]  And so then the bag just doesn't become usable.
[56:59.360 --> 57:00.440]  So I thought, fuck it.
[57:00.460 --> 57:05.420]  I'll just put it in the pan as a giant icicle and the heat from the pan will melt it.
[57:05.420 --> 57:07.220]  So I throw some olive oil in there.
[57:07.480 --> 57:12.620]  I put the entire bag of shredded hash browns, just this huge, like three pound chunk of
[57:12.620 --> 57:12.980]  potato.
[57:13.320 --> 57:14.660]  Put that in the pan.
[57:14.900 --> 57:18.940]  And it's like it's not cooking very great, but it's like we're slowly melting and I'm
[57:18.940 --> 57:19.740]  able to break it.
[57:20.300 --> 57:26.940]  And then I encounter this problem about halfway through where I guess from all the water from
[57:26.940 --> 57:32.160]  the ice surrounding the potato, they cease to be hash browns and they just turned into
[57:32.160 --> 57:32.940]  mashed potatoes.
[57:34.220 --> 57:37.420]  And I didn't, I didn't know what to do for this point.
[57:37.540 --> 57:41.780]  I was not prepared to make mashed potatoes and I messaged the Slack.
[57:41.900 --> 57:42.920]  It was like 3am.
[57:43.000 --> 57:43.900]  I was like, what do I do?
[57:44.180 --> 57:45.000]  How do I salvage?
[57:45.560 --> 57:45.960]  Disgusting.
[57:46.480 --> 57:47.580]  Yeah, it's not good.
[57:47.840 --> 57:49.000]  It didn't look good at all.
[57:49.100 --> 57:49.500]  So I didn't know.
[57:49.560 --> 57:50.760]  Do I put an egg in it?
[57:51.180 --> 57:52.880]  Do I throw some milk in there?
[57:53.480 --> 57:55.820]  Well, I don't know how to make good mashed potatoes.
[57:56.020 --> 57:57.640]  I'm not a big mashed potato person.
[57:57.880 --> 57:59.540]  Oh, so your plan is to pivot?
[58:00.100 --> 58:03.480]  Yeah, at this point, the hash brown dream is dead, Gavin.
[58:03.620 --> 58:06.480]  There's no way that those just cease to be hash browns.
[58:06.620 --> 58:11.260]  I now have mashed potatoes and the conversation becomes, well, how do I make decent mashed
[58:11.260 --> 58:11.620]  potatoes?
[58:11.980 --> 58:12.940]  What do I do here?
[58:13.040 --> 58:17.120]  If you fry mashed potatoes, isn't that kind of hash brownie in texture?
[58:17.400 --> 58:19.900]  There was no fry happening to these things.
[58:20.040 --> 58:22.320]  Like it was just, they were, it was so thick.
[58:22.520 --> 58:25.840]  It was like solid, weird mashed potato.
[58:26.420 --> 58:27.180]  And I didn't know what to do.
[58:27.260 --> 58:28.060]  It was 3am.
[58:28.280 --> 58:28.560]  So much.
[58:28.560 --> 58:31.360]  Yeah, so there's nobody I could, I just messaged to Slack.
[58:31.460 --> 58:33.160]  I was like, I don't, I doubt anyone's awake.
[58:33.200 --> 58:34.300]  If they are, what do I do?
[58:34.580 --> 58:35.460]  How do I get out of this problem?
[58:35.680 --> 58:36.600]  Do I put an egg in?
[58:36.840 --> 58:37.500]  I don't know.
[58:38.160 --> 58:39.860]  I didn't, I didn't put any eggs in.
[58:39.940 --> 58:40.900]  I had a few eggs in my fridge.
[58:40.960 --> 58:41.600]  Didn't put them in.
[58:42.480 --> 58:44.040]  I put half and half in there.
[58:44.120 --> 58:45.020]  That was my first step.
[58:45.080 --> 58:46.520]  I'm like, I'll throw some half and half in.
[58:46.760 --> 58:48.220]  That seems like a thing you would do.
[58:48.680 --> 58:50.660]  Then I threw, uh, I don't know.
[58:50.680 --> 58:54.600]  It's just, I feel like there's milk and eggs, a little half and half.
[58:55.240 --> 58:57.180]  Or not milk and eggs, milk and mashed potatoes.
[58:58.120 --> 58:59.580]  Um, so I put that in.
[58:59.720 --> 59:01.400]  Then I threw some butter in there.
[59:01.460 --> 59:04.280]  Because I feel like that's probably another thing you put in mashed potatoes.
[59:04.760 --> 59:05.880]  Put a lot of butter in.
[59:05.920 --> 59:06.980]  I put way too much butter in.
[59:07.580 --> 59:09.360]  And then I threw some cheese slices in.
[59:09.420 --> 59:11.340]  Because cheese, melted cheese is just good.
[59:11.660 --> 59:13.860]  There's no way the melted cheese could make it worse.
[59:15.160 --> 59:17.760]  And, uh, I just kind of stirred it all up.
[59:18.240 --> 59:20.100]  It was, it was horrible.
[59:20.480 --> 59:22.440]  I couldn't, I didn't take a photo of it.
[59:22.560 --> 59:23.840]  Oh no, oh no.
[59:24.080 --> 59:25.780]  He made me laugh and I pooped a little bit.
[59:25.840 --> 59:26.520]  I think I'll be back.
[59:26.520 --> 59:27.060]  Oh shit.
[59:27.960 --> 59:29.160]  What do I mean?
[59:32.300 --> 59:35.740]  We were talking about how he's destined for shit in the future.
[59:36.340 --> 59:38.420]  He just shat himself now.
[59:39.020 --> 59:41.880]  And I'm staring at a frying pan full of potato.
[59:42.220 --> 59:43.040]  And he shits himself.
[59:43.760 --> 59:45.540]  Year two off to a great start.
[59:45.760 --> 59:47.900]  It's a great, this is a great start.
[59:48.280 --> 59:53.780]  And you, it's like, it's like when Mr. Bean wrecks Whistler's mother, right?
[59:53.820 --> 59:55.700]  And he's just trying to like, add shit to it.
[59:55.700 --> 59:58.500]  Why are you trying to throw cheese and eggs onto your mistake?
[59:58.900 --> 01:00:00.800]  Why don't you just start again for Christ's sake?
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:01.880]  What do you mean start again?
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:02.400]  From what?
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.600]  That was the bag.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:04.860]  Where do I start from?
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.340]  I can't throw away one bag.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.700]  What do you mean?
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.320]  Like just create hash browns?
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.880]  Just fucking summon hash browns.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.580]  Just summon a bag of hash browns.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.560]  That's great advice.
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.800]  I feel like you could have dumped out some of the mash and just like got a nice little fry on.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.640]  I could, well maybe, but like, as I said, I didn't know what to do.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.420]  Gavin, when you're making hash browns and they suddenly turn to mashed potatoes,
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.200]  you are stunned.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.540]  It is hard to process what to do next.
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.360]  I was trying to just go through the scenario.
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:32.280]  Are you okay, Geoff?
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.120]  Yeah, I caught it.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:33.740]  I caught it.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:34.400]  Yeah, a little bit.
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:34.960]  A little bit.
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:35.680]  I caught it.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:41.540]  You made me laugh right as I was farting and like it put a little pressure.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.460]  And so I felt like a little hot squirt and I just clenched up and I ran in the bathroom
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:48.860]  and I was able to save the, like, no, it was clean.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.340]  We're good.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:49.660]  We're good.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.360]  But it definitely, it definitely was clean.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.260]  There definitely wasn't escape.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.320]  I clenched it.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.200]  I kept it in.
[01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:58.920]  But yeah, I definitely shit a little bit there.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.000]  As if...
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:05.100]  Fucking why not?
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.260]  Shit the dog, shit myself, who cares?
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.980]  I mean, it tastes, I'll just say it tasted delicious.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.460]  I can only eat a little bit of it.
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.080]  I think we recorded the next day and I felt so sick the next morning.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:16.740]  Is it because of the butter?
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:21.420]  I think, yeah, it was just so oily and like cheesy and just awful.
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.240]  I threw 95% of it away.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.180]  I tried like 5%.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.360]  You don't always have to power through.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.080]  You don't always have to add stuff and then still eat it.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.300]  Like you got to the point where I, it's 3am for me.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.860]  If it's 3am for me and I've got a frying pan full of mash, I'm probably going to throw that away.
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:42.700]  I'm probably not going to try and make that into some sort of weirdo omelette and get it down.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.760]  I didn't, there's no eggs.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.340]  I don't think it would be an omelette territory, but I got some milk in there.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:52.860]  The official combination was milk, butter, cheese, and it was delicious, as I said,
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:56.580]  but not meant for this world and could not contain in anyone's stomach.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.760]  It was dreadful.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.480]  So I threw, as I said, no, I said I threw 95% of it away.
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:03.180]  I just gave a little taste.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.740]  I just wanted to see what it tasted like.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.000]  And I was like, this is really good.
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:06.980]  Can't eat this.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.120]  This is death.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.580]  I threw it away.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.240]  It was like oozing butter.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.240]  Should that be in the official f*** face recipe book?
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.020]  No, no, it should not be in the official.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.960]  If you want to feel sick, maybe.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.360]  Maybe we just put like a shitty recipe section.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:26.580]  So you've learned that wet hash browns become mash.
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:28.180]  Yes, I have.
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:28.900]  I didn't learn that.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:29.860]  Interesting.
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:31.920]  Yeah, that's a good life lesson.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.780]  Were you stirring it up though?
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.180]  Were you like fluffing it more into mash as it was cooking?
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.320]  Well, it was a weird thing where it was an iceberg, essentially, Gavin, remember?
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.040]  So it was tough.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:48.500]  Like I was trying to just break it down and get all the potato hot so it would melt faster.
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:52.200]  And I think just in that process created the hash brown issue.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.620]  I think you were f***ed from the jump because of the iceberg.
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:56.200]  Oh, totally.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.700]  It was not savable at any point.
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:02.920]  I think I needed to find a way to get rid of the water.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.040]  Well, I'm like, maybe like I could have put it in the microwave for a little bit.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.040]  Like I needed to melt.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.700]  I needed to separate the water from the...
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:12.660]  Yeah, I think you needed it in a sieve above some sort of collection.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.980]  I think it just the potato had just been...
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.900]  It was just too soaked through at that point.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:22.080]  I think that as it melted, the integrity of the potato would suffer.
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:26.740]  Okay, let's, you know, maybe I'll try again.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.200]  Well, I don't know how I'd simulate that again.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.320]  There'd be next time I'm prepared, though.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:34.000]  I'll know not to just put the whole thing in the f***ing pan.
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:36.040]  What are all the bits in the potato?
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.320]  What are all the bits?
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.140]  Oh, the bits are...
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.520]  It crusted on one side.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.360]  Those are like crunchy crust bits when it was like flat.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.460]  Because I tried to...
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.800]  That, I thank you for saying that.
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:51.340]  You reminded me.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:57.660]  I realized something was wrong when my hash brown started whistling and inflating.
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.320]  Once it started to...
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.880]  Like I would try to compress it to like get a sear on a side to like create a crust on it.
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:09.120]  And it would start to inflate from the pan like it was a balloon.
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.120]  And then so I poked a hole in it and it just started to whistle.
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.980]  And I was like, this is gonna be difficult to say.
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:19.280]  Created some like advanced mechanical engineering demonstration or something like
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:22.960]  weird chemistry and shit going on underneath that must have been insane.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.020]  That's like my... I'd recommend switching olive oil.
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:29.740]  That's the heart of the story.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:32.420]  If you're using butter to cook hash browns,
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.700]  pivot to olive oil or some other type of oil with a high smoking point.
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.860]  Avocado oil, maybe.
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:37.780]  I haven't tried it.
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:39.860]  I'm looking at this disgusting picture of...
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.840]  It looks like someone just threw something into a pan.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.680]  I'm gonna...
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.640]  And I'm getting advice.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:46.840]  Next time I make it, Gavin, I'll send you a photo.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:47.740]  You'll be impressed.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.220]  You'll be like, those are pretty fucking good.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:49.660]  Those look...
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:52.320]  And I don't know what it is about the lighting in your apartment,
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.440]  but it makes everything look disgusting.
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.100]  It makes everything look way worse.
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:00.080]  It looks like way more dingy than it probably is.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.380]  But that looks just right.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.460]  Oh, it's very nice.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:03.760]  Yeah, it looks great.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:11.480]  I took several photos of that too to try to make it look as nice as possible.
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:12.300]  I was like, this is...
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.100]  My favorite part is just the lump of it that's slightly too high up the fork.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.780]  It's out of the forking zone.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.460]  Oh, I forgot the fork, but I didn't notice that.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.720]  I clearly was just like, I don't know what to do here.
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:27.240]  I need help.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.920]  I would like to salvage these.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:34.920]  We get so much enjoyment from the additional snippets just in around your photos.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.700]  You see other identifiers.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:41.560]  I'm learning little pieces about your life just by the stuff that's in your photos.
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:50.300]  Oh, should we stop talking to each other?
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.480]  Yeah, I feel like this is a good episode.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:55.840]  I need to fucking take a nap after that.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:56.320]  I'm tired.
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:03.000]  Eric wanted us to mention that we sell merchandise.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:04.660]  And so there you go.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:05.700]  What do we sell?
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.980]  How many face merch items do we even have?
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.440]  Well, we got the Ian shirt.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.920]  We've got the F*** Face shirt.
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:14.520]  We've got the Russian fuck hat.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.260]  I'm going off top of my head.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.320]  We got the Zimmer zone shirt.
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:17.960]  Child kicker.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.580]  Got the child kicker shirt.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.820]  We got the waffle scented air freshener.
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:27.100]  We have the child kicker sticker.
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.020]  We got the sockets.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:29.860]  We've had a couple of bats.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:30.940]  There will be...
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.540]  I am prototyping the...
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.380]  Always fall in proto.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.180]  F*** Face socks.
[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:39.540]  They're pretty rad.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.680]  The two left socks.
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.820]  Been digging those.
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:44.920]  So hopefully those will be out at some point.
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.000]  And...
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.020]  A classic from season one.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:47.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.100]  A classic from season one and year one.
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.080]  I don't really know what else.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.400]  Eric says 11.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.320]  He says we have 11 F*** Faces to sell.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.180]  I feel like we covered all of it.
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:55.580]  There you go.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.480]  So there, Eric.
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:58.600]  I mentioned the merchandise.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.600]  Oh, I forgot to even talk about how I thought Andrew died on while he was streaming.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.460]  Oh, well, hold on.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:06.880]  Let's...
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:07.160]  All right.
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:09.440]  Well, let's get into that real fast.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.060]  We already teased the bullshit merch.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:11.640]  Now we can...
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.240]  Let's talk about that.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.260]  What's going on?
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:13.880]  He was streaming.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:16.060]  He like finally got like past this really hard bit.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.540]  He was pretty much on par to beat my time.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.720]  And then he just paused the game and went silent.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.100]  And everyone was like, uh, is he okay?
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:27.160]  And I thought I was just egging him on too much and making him too stressed.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.020]  I thought he had a heart attack and dropped dead.
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:34.520]  I was like coming to terms in my head with I've just killed him.
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:40.540]  So what happened was I just hit pause by accident and then everyone's like,
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.180]  what happened?
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:42.760]  And everyone was speculating.
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.800]  So I just sat and read as people were like...
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.560]  He went silent for like 50 seconds straight.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.440]  Yes, just enjoying people being like, what the fuck happened?
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:52.900]  Is everything okay?
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:53.720]  It's great.
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:54.460]  That's fine.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.160]  I was...
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:58.260]  I was probably 30 seconds away from calling you.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.500]  If you didn't answer, I was going to call 9-1-1 and deploy people to Canada somehow.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:03.960]  I didn't know how I was going to do it.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.520]  Ah, good episode.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:07.900]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.320]  Oh, I should also mention...
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:15.620]  June 25th will be the next F*** Face Break Shit live stream.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.440]  So if you liked the first one, you can watch it again.
[01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:20.940]  Or if you didn't like the first one, watch the second one.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:21.620]  You'll like this one.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.220]  We'll do it better.
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:25.160]  Or if you've never heard of it, now's your chance to hear of it.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.040]  Stop being a dickhead and watch our content.
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:31.060]  And this one will be good because I have a special card.
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.500]  I have special stuff for Andrew.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:35.280]  And I have special stuff for Eric.
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.260]  And I bought special stuff for my little Gavin.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.140]  And I even bought some special stuff for regular fan Jack,
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:45.980]  including something I haven't got for me yet, but I'm looking forward to as well.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.680]  So hopefully this one will be even.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.960]  It'll be the second one.
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:51.460]  So it'll be twice as good as the first one, which wouldn't be hard to do.
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:53.220]  And that's it.
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:53.960]  This is F*** Face.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:54.880]  Bye.
