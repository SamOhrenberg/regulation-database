[00:04.600 --> 00:11.460]  The following supplemental content was filmed immediately after episode 91 of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:12.140 --> 00:18.000]  Allow us please, if you will, the opportunity to peel back the curtain and let you see unfiltered
[00:18.000 --> 00:20.580]  the many frustrations of Eric Baudour.
[00:31.160 --> 00:36.280]  October 1st onward. Okay. So why bring up September at all?
[00:36.280 --> 00:39.360]  Okay, this is why. Isn't that winter?
[00:40.660 --> 00:47.000]  Okay, calm down. Listen, f***ing go bury a porn stash, you f***ing ridiculous knob-having d***head.
[00:47.200 --> 00:49.500]  If we're gonna do October, we should do Apple content.
[00:50.880 --> 00:52.680]  Ridiculous knob-what-to-schedule.
[00:52.900 --> 00:56.180]  I don't know. I was just annoyed at you. I'm annoyed about all this.
[00:56.780 --> 01:01.720]  This is not a big deal at all. I've never been to Vegas. The only thing I'd want to do in Vegas,
[01:01.900 --> 01:05.940]  the only reason why I'd want to visit Vegas is to gamble and watch sports.
[01:05.940 --> 01:12.320]  There are none of in June. It'd be the least I would never book. So it's unrelated to that.
[01:12.560 --> 01:18.080]  But if we do go in October, we could do possibly like NFL stuff or like we could do more sports.
[01:18.260 --> 01:23.300]  So what if it's not? What if it's not Vegas? Is June still on the table?
[01:23.740 --> 01:28.560]  No, I don't want to travel to the U.S. I don't want to travel to the U.S. in June.
[01:28.680 --> 01:29.900]  I'm probably not going to go to RTX.
[01:29.900 --> 01:31.120]  How about this, though?
[01:33.940 --> 01:41.560]  If it's Andrew, if it's if it's early June, you have the NBA finals and the playoffs still
[01:41.560 --> 01:43.780]  that that wraps up in mid-June.
[01:43.880 --> 01:45.860]  And this is like a small aside.
[01:46.200 --> 01:48.180]  I will also say just throwing it out there.
[01:48.460 --> 01:50.100]  They're the best thing to bet on.
[01:50.300 --> 01:52.580]  The absolute best thing to bet on is horses.
[01:52.580 --> 01:54.220]  And the horses run 365.
[01:54.700 --> 01:56.820]  I don't I don't like and I can't do it. Can't do horses.
[01:57.180 --> 01:59.100]  You will. You will. You get caught up in it.
[01:59.100 --> 02:00.740]  I will not get caught. I will.
[02:01.040 --> 02:05.240]  Listen, I got fucking Turkish ping pong or some shit that I could find before I'd go to horses.
[02:06.500 --> 02:07.500]  I don't know, man.
[02:07.600 --> 02:09.200]  You've never been to Vegas once you're there.
[02:09.320 --> 02:10.120]  It's a whole different world.
[02:10.520 --> 02:11.460]  I don't trust horses.
[02:12.040 --> 02:14.300]  I don't understand how the betting works for it.
[02:14.300 --> 02:15.160]  And I don't trust them.
[02:16.640 --> 02:20.160]  I'm not like, you know how I said that I'm really good at reading bobs.
[02:20.240 --> 02:24.200]  Like, I feel really confident in my ability to read if somebody's a bob or not by appearance.
[02:24.320 --> 02:26.200]  I got no read on what a good horse is.
[02:26.500 --> 02:28.040]  I could show you what a good horse is.
[02:28.100 --> 02:28.800]  I'm fucking great.
[02:28.800 --> 02:30.640]  No, I don't trust for horses.
[02:30.840 --> 02:32.180]  I can't bob for horses.
[02:32.540 --> 02:34.200]  That's a great way of phrasing that.
[02:34.660 --> 02:36.060]  No skill in the horse game.
[02:36.680 --> 02:41.400]  I like that you the only thing you won't bet on is the most popular thing in the world to bet on.
[02:41.720 --> 02:43.520]  I think that that is incorrect.
[02:43.840 --> 02:46.900]  I would be shocked if horse betting is the number one leading.
[02:47.380 --> 02:48.280]  We're making an episode.
[02:52.220 --> 02:53.660]  Are we done? Are we good?
[02:53.740 --> 02:54.260]  Do we do it?
[02:54.340 --> 02:55.740]  When are we going to watch a movie together?
[02:56.360 --> 02:57.760]  Well, I just hit record.
[02:57.760 --> 02:59.960]  So I want to know, I'd be mad if we're done.
[02:59.960 --> 03:00.640]  Why did you hit record?
[03:01.980 --> 03:03.420]  This isn't an episode.
[03:03.720 --> 03:05.220]  Then why the fuck is Craig here?
[03:05.980 --> 03:07.980]  Why is Craig here if we're not doing anything?
[03:08.780 --> 03:10.580]  Just in case of what?
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.460]  Just in case you got another tirade against Jack.
[03:14.880 --> 03:16.340]  Well, then I should be recording.
[03:16.500 --> 03:20.300]  No, we're not doing two of these.
[03:20.500 --> 03:25.240]  We've already spent 80 minutes talking about Tuesday at fucking 5 a.m.
[03:25.260 --> 03:26.620]  You're so angry.
[03:27.240 --> 03:28.900]  Yeah, it makes no sense.
[03:29.120 --> 03:31.020]  Vegas in June has pissed him off.
[03:31.780 --> 03:35.820]  God, never say the words Vegas in summer, June or summer.
[03:35.980 --> 03:36.820]  I think it's the horses.
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.120]  I think the horses made him mad.
[03:38.880 --> 03:40.300]  I don't know how to read horses.
[03:42.080 --> 03:44.280]  Andrew, that's the reason we have Craig recording.
[03:46.720 --> 03:48.380]  If it was, this is okay.
[03:48.460 --> 03:51.380]  The only time I'm all in, if it was a racing stripe scenario,
[03:51.500 --> 03:53.520]  if you got a zebra on the field, I'm all about it.
[03:53.560 --> 03:56.100]  I would bet that zebra and I would come out on top
[03:56.100 --> 03:58.320]  because that was a fast, not horse.
[03:58.720 --> 04:00.880]  I just like how softly you started.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.280]  You're like, yeah, I prefer if it was a little bit later in the year
[04:03.280 --> 04:05.100]  and then cut to a minute later.
[04:05.200 --> 04:08.260]  I will not set foot in the USA in June.
[04:08.720 --> 04:15.240]  Because it's an escalation if I listen to you fucking guys talk about Tuesday for eight hours.
[04:15.520 --> 04:18.840]  And so I was patient at the first sign of annoyance.
[04:18.900 --> 04:19.460]  It's like, I'm done.
[04:19.800 --> 04:20.600]  I've been polite.
[04:20.680 --> 04:21.660]  I'm exhausted.
[04:22.020 --> 04:24.360]  I don't want to hear about fucking Tuesday again.
[04:24.360 --> 04:27.660]  I got to get up at 5am, which is fine.
[04:27.940 --> 04:29.340]  It's fine. I'm just going to be on a comedy.
[04:29.420 --> 04:30.160]  It's not hard.
[04:30.600 --> 04:31.380]  But fucking...
[04:31.380 --> 04:32.280]  Ah, goddamn.
[04:32.500 --> 04:36.640]  You motherfuckers are going to be talking about your breakfast tacos and how good it is.
[04:36.880 --> 04:38.000]  Nothing's going to be open.
[04:38.420 --> 04:40.560]  You're going to have a fucking cold bowl of oatmeal.
[04:40.840 --> 04:42.460]  Just annoyed at all of you.
[04:42.680 --> 04:45.440]  You have 70 pounds of pancake mix, man.
[04:45.520 --> 04:46.720]  Oh, I got 70 pounds of pancake.
[04:46.780 --> 04:47.880]  Maybe I don't want to fucking make...
[04:47.880 --> 04:48.620]  That's the day.
[04:48.840 --> 04:50.120]  That's the day to get it started.
[04:50.400 --> 04:53.720]  No, I'm going to fucking wake up even earlier and get the pancakes going.
[04:53.720 --> 04:54.880]  And then I'm going to have to make bacon.
[04:54.880 --> 04:56.440]  What time does McDonald's open?
[04:56.860 --> 04:58.860]  They don't open until like 7.
[04:59.160 --> 05:00.820]  They don't open until like 7 for me.
[05:01.200 --> 05:01.600]  What?
[05:02.040 --> 05:02.440]  7am.
[05:03.320 --> 05:03.720]  Really?
[05:04.360 --> 05:05.200]  For how I get them.
[05:05.660 --> 05:07.380]  Well, I'd have to get them delivered here.
[05:07.600 --> 05:09.900]  So I can't... that doesn't open until 7.
[05:10.600 --> 05:10.920]  Hmm.
[05:12.720 --> 05:13.520]  Ah, weird.
[05:14.220 --> 05:15.320]  Un-fucking-believable.
[05:15.980 --> 05:16.620]  Cold oatmeal.
[05:17.080 --> 05:18.840]  I mean, you could have said we didn't have to do it then.
[05:19.300 --> 05:20.580]  Yeah, you also had a say.
[05:20.760 --> 05:21.960]  Well, no, listen.
[05:21.960 --> 05:23.740]  Not all of you were all on board.
[05:23.820 --> 05:27.460]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[05:27.460 --> 05:29.700]  A team player would go to Vegas and tell you.
[05:29.920 --> 05:33.740]  I was absolutely not on board and asked you four or five times.
[05:34.060 --> 05:38.140]  I asked you four or five times if you're sure it's 6am.
[05:38.900 --> 05:42.600]  You know the fucking puzzle in Mario Party where it's like look left or whatever.
[05:42.700 --> 05:43.100]  Look right.
[05:43.180 --> 05:44.200]  You got to try to fucking figure out.
[05:44.260 --> 05:45.200]  I don't know what Geoff wants.
[05:45.580 --> 05:47.300]  Geoff said, I want to do another episode.
[05:47.500 --> 05:49.560]  And then 10 seconds later, he's like, I'm tired.
[05:49.620 --> 05:50.560]  I don't want to do another episode.
[05:50.560 --> 05:52.280]  I've got no idea how to read this.
[05:52.340 --> 05:54.000]  People are talking about Tuesday night.
[05:54.120 --> 05:55.220]  People are talking about Wednesday.
[05:55.380 --> 05:56.640]  You're traveling to Chicago.
[05:57.080 --> 05:59.200]  It's a fucking jumbled mess of wires.
[05:59.340 --> 06:01.540]  So I just can't. I cannot listen to it.
[06:01.780 --> 06:04.020]  I just didn't hear a single word any of you said.
[06:04.360 --> 06:08.660]  And then you all seem to be excited and pumped about fucking let's get up super early.
[06:08.720 --> 06:10.800]  I'm not excited about that at all.
[06:10.840 --> 06:11.820]  Let's do it.
[06:12.020 --> 06:13.120]  Woo, morning show.
[06:13.220 --> 06:13.980]  How exciting.
[06:14.340 --> 06:15.420]  So I just said yes.
[06:15.580 --> 06:16.280]  Oh my God.
[06:16.740 --> 06:19.220]  This show couldn't have less of a morning show vibe.
[06:19.220 --> 06:21.100]  I think the later the better.
[06:21.240 --> 06:23.380]  It will be our worst episode.
[06:23.920 --> 06:26.180]  Andrew, do you?
[06:26.760 --> 06:28.720]  Would you prefer not to do it on Tuesday?
[06:28.840 --> 06:33.700]  No, because I would rather be annoyed and right than comforted and wrong.
[06:34.040 --> 06:35.060]  Listen, Gavin.
[06:35.300 --> 06:38.420]  Let's do our great 8am episode for you and Central.
[06:38.860 --> 06:41.460]  And then at some point, we'll do an evening episode.
[06:42.100 --> 06:44.140]  And it will be significantly better.
[06:45.080 --> 06:48.820]  Listen, Gavin, it's important that you know that he's a team player sometimes.
[06:49.220 --> 06:49.500]  Yeah.
[06:50.500 --> 06:51.280]  Team fucking Gavin.
[06:51.280 --> 06:53.400]  Why don't we just do it Tuesday in the evening?
[06:53.780 --> 06:57.660]  No, we're doing Tuesday morning because that's what we want to do.
[06:57.740 --> 06:59.020]  We're all excited about it.
[06:59.080 --> 07:02.720]  What about Tuesday morning and Tuesday evening?
[07:02.840 --> 07:03.920]  We'll see which one's better.
[07:04.460 --> 07:06.100]  Boom, four episodes next week.
[07:06.200 --> 07:07.200]  I love it.
[07:07.320 --> 07:07.720]  That's it.
[07:07.780 --> 07:09.740]  So what time do you want to do the Tuesday evening?
[07:09.740 --> 07:11.960]  Andrew, you bought us another episode next week.
[07:12.220 --> 07:12.980]  No, no, no, no.
[07:13.260 --> 07:16.120]  We do one on Thursday, one Tuesday morning, one Tuesday evening.
[07:16.140 --> 07:17.480]  Okay, what time Tuesday evening?
[07:17.480 --> 07:19.420]  I can go as late as you want on Tuesday evening.
[07:19.500 --> 07:20.460]  It can be like late night.
[07:20.500 --> 07:21.040]  I don't care.
[07:21.200 --> 07:22.780]  I'll do up to like 10 p.m.
[07:23.300 --> 07:24.300]  I mean, it's up to you guys.
[07:24.380 --> 07:25.160]  Let me know what time works.
[07:26.860 --> 07:28.340]  I'll go 10 p.m.
[07:28.340 --> 07:28.980]  10 to 11.
[07:29.100 --> 07:30.660]  What about 11 to 12 for you guys?
[07:31.200 --> 07:31.860]  11 to 12 for me?
[07:31.940 --> 07:32.260]  Yeah, sure.
[07:32.420 --> 07:33.760]  Yeah, 9 to 10 for me.
[07:33.900 --> 07:34.700]  We're doing 6 a.m.
[07:34.720 --> 07:36.980]  We're doing a morning show and a late show.
[07:37.720 --> 07:40.120]  That'll be 18 hours after we wake up.
[07:42.360 --> 07:43.880]  Why are we trying to pick?
[07:43.880 --> 07:49.000]  Why are we waking up early to do an episode and then doing an episode as late as we possibly can?
[07:50.660 --> 07:54.100]  Andrew, this doesn't bode well for you.
[07:54.360 --> 07:54.700]  No.
[07:54.980 --> 07:58.360]  If you want a better evening episode, we're all going to be fucking loopy.
[07:58.420 --> 07:58.940]  No, no, no.
[07:58.980 --> 07:59.780]  Okay, listen here.
[07:59.940 --> 08:03.400]  I age like a wine throughout the day.
[08:03.520 --> 08:04.920]  I'm going to be peak hours.
[08:05.060 --> 08:06.980]  I'm going to be peak performance by your 11.
[08:07.220 --> 08:08.460]  I'm not worried about you.
[08:08.540 --> 08:09.900]  That's 9 p.m. for you.
[08:10.040 --> 08:12.300]  I'm worried about, honestly, Geoff.
[08:12.760 --> 08:17.120]  Oh, they're going to experience what it's like to be tired.
[08:17.820 --> 08:18.060]  Yeah.
[08:18.400 --> 08:18.820]  Enjoy.
[08:19.140 --> 08:19.940]  Enjoy, fuckers.
[08:20.000 --> 08:20.900]  It's the other end of that.
[08:21.040 --> 08:22.020]  That was me this morning.
[08:22.400 --> 08:23.840]  It's a teeter-totter, bitch.
[08:24.020 --> 08:24.920]  It's your turn.
[08:25.200 --> 08:26.460]  I'm on the other side.
[08:27.680 --> 08:31.360]  So we are doing 11 p.m. on Tuesday?
[08:31.500 --> 08:32.880]  Yes, 11 central.
[08:33.460 --> 08:34.200]  11 central.
[08:34.640 --> 08:35.160]  Oh my god.
[08:35.160 --> 08:35.360]  Right.
[08:35.760 --> 08:36.700]  So I'm going to wake up.
[08:36.800 --> 08:37.760]  I'm going to do a fuckface.
[08:37.960 --> 08:41.320]  I'm going to spend probably 12 to 14 hours filming in a quarry.
[08:41.500 --> 08:41.720]  Yeah.
[08:41.720 --> 08:44.120]  Then I'm going to come back and do a fuckface.
[08:45.180 --> 08:47.040]  So you're going to...
[08:48.920 --> 08:49.960]  The invite said...
[08:50.580 --> 08:51.640]  I sent the invite.
[08:52.060 --> 08:52.680]  I'm excited.
[08:53.240 --> 08:55.400]  You know who else spends all day in a quarry, Gavin?
[08:55.640 --> 08:56.460]  Fred Flintstone.
[08:56.640 --> 08:57.640]  And he's a cool motherfucker.
[08:58.200 --> 08:58.800]  It's true.
[08:59.060 --> 09:02.820]  I'm supposed to get a haircut at like 9.30 in the morning on Tuesday.
[09:03.200 --> 09:06.240]  And I have face jam that day.
[09:06.340 --> 09:06.920]  I'm going to be fucked.
[09:06.980 --> 09:07.920]  This is going to be fucked up.
[09:08.240 --> 09:09.720]  It's going to be a full day.
[09:10.800 --> 09:11.560]  It's going to be fantastic.
[09:11.960 --> 09:13.480]  All right, well, let's see how it goes.
[09:13.780 --> 09:16.320]  I might actually be in a bad mood on Tuesday evening.
[09:16.420 --> 09:17.460]  That might be the first.
[09:17.600 --> 09:19.260]  I'll genuinely be a crabby.
[09:19.440 --> 09:19.740]  That'd be awesome.
[09:19.800 --> 09:20.420]  I can't wait.
[09:20.960 --> 09:21.720]  It's going to be great.
[09:22.860 --> 09:23.720]  Okay, we got it.
[09:23.920 --> 09:24.380]  We have...
[09:24.380 --> 09:28.360]  We could have just recorded a second episode literally a bit halfway through at this point.
[09:28.360 --> 09:30.820]  But no, we got to talk about Tuesday.
[09:31.900 --> 09:33.500]  Uh, well, I am still recording.
[09:34.040 --> 09:34.940]  We're not doing...
[09:34.940 --> 09:36.440]  This is done in like three minutes.
[09:36.720 --> 09:37.720]  When are we going to watch a movie?
[09:37.780 --> 09:38.880]  I want to watch MVP2.
[09:38.880 --> 09:40.360]  When are we going to do another one of those?
[09:41.060 --> 09:43.040]  How are we going to watch that without watching the first one?
[09:43.420 --> 09:44.200]  Yeah, you don't...
[09:44.620 --> 09:46.300]  Hey, hey, Andrew.
[09:46.780 --> 09:47.700]  Andrew, I'm with you.
[09:47.800 --> 09:48.700]  Let's watch MVP2.
[09:48.940 --> 09:55.100]  I will only watch MVP2 if Andrew cuts a previously on from the first movie.
[09:55.540 --> 09:57.040]  Yeah, I'll gladly do that.
[09:57.220 --> 09:59.440]  I need a primer before I dive into this.
[09:59.440 --> 10:01.900]  I think, you know, and that could be something the audience could use as well.
[10:01.960 --> 10:03.020]  I have no problem doing that.
[10:03.140 --> 10:04.360]  I'm going to do it in Q1.
[10:07.040 --> 10:08.460]  How about the 18th?
[10:09.500 --> 10:10.140]  Of when?
[10:11.020 --> 10:11.380]  March?
[10:11.900 --> 10:12.260]  February?
[10:12.900 --> 10:14.660]  I don't think we can do that because Gavin will be busy.
[10:14.780 --> 10:15.940]  I think I'll be gone by then.
[10:16.220 --> 10:16.720]  Oh, will you?
[10:16.920 --> 10:19.660]  OK, so you want to do it in Q1, but you're unavailable for a month.
[10:19.800 --> 10:20.660]  OK, let's see.
[10:22.180 --> 10:22.900]  March 18th.
[10:23.220 --> 10:23.620]  Yeah, sure.
[10:24.140 --> 10:24.880]  OK, good for me.
[10:25.080 --> 10:28.160]  I mean, you're going to forget why we have what we're doing.
[10:28.480 --> 10:29.920]  No, no, I will not.
[10:30.200 --> 10:30.660]  This is...
[10:30.660 --> 10:31.040]  I'm excited.
[10:32.020 --> 10:34.980]  1pm, 1 to 4, our time, central time.
[10:35.040 --> 10:35.640]  Does that work?
[10:36.320 --> 10:37.500]  Or do you want to do it later?
[10:37.740 --> 10:38.720]  Like, is it like...
[10:39.200 --> 10:40.140]  I do not.
[10:40.340 --> 10:41.740]  I'm so excited about MVP 2.
[10:41.800 --> 10:42.700]  I'll do that at any time.
[10:42.940 --> 10:44.020]  I've got no preference.
[10:44.200 --> 10:45.060]  Whatever works for all of you.
[10:45.360 --> 10:46.740]  Will you watch it in Vegas in June?
[10:47.200 --> 10:47.760]  No, I will not.
[10:49.720 --> 10:52.640]  I'll fucking throw a hot sauce in your face, though.
[10:52.980 --> 10:54.660]  Oh my god, that's aggressive.
[10:55.200 --> 10:55.980]  Good lord.
[10:56.240 --> 10:57.000]  Yeah, what's up, Geoff?
[10:57.440 --> 10:59.300]  Fucking delicious BTS sauce at him.
[11:00.380 --> 11:03.640]  Eric, can we release this as bonus supplemental content?
[11:03.640 --> 11:04.360]  Yeah, I don't...
[11:04.360 --> 11:06.100]  Honestly, I don't care.
[11:06.360 --> 11:06.660]  Sure.
[11:06.660 --> 11:10.720]  Can this be like, uh, how we schedule an episode?
[11:11.020 --> 11:12.780]  Yeah, honestly, call it...
[11:12.780 --> 11:17.800]  This is Eric's job every week across eight different shows.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.260]  Just call it that.
[11:19.500 --> 11:21.060]  Just call it, what does Eric do?
[11:21.380 --> 11:22.620]  And then it's this.
[11:23.020 --> 11:24.040]  Because this is it.
[11:24.620 --> 11:25.420]  This is it.
[11:27.080 --> 11:29.480]  MVP 2, 1 to 4.
[11:29.680 --> 11:30.720]  Does that work?
[11:30.820 --> 11:32.120]  Or do you want a later time?
[11:32.560 --> 11:33.260]  Uh, what day is that?
[11:33.300 --> 11:34.820]  The 18th of March.
[11:35.240 --> 11:35.540]  It's a Friday.
[11:36.020 --> 11:36.840]  March, I forgot.
[11:37.120 --> 11:38.340]  I don't have a drink!
[11:39.780 --> 11:40.840]  Uh, hold on.
[11:41.040 --> 11:42.980]  If you have something booked on March 18th...
[11:44.180 --> 11:45.220]  No, you know what?
[11:47.100 --> 11:47.460]  Uh...
[11:48.240 --> 11:49.100]  No, that's fine.
[11:49.620 --> 11:50.540]  It's, uh, it's fine.
[11:50.960 --> 11:52.020]  March 18th is good for me.
[11:52.460 --> 11:52.820]  Wonderful.
[11:53.180 --> 11:54.040]  I'm gonna put it...
[11:54.040 --> 11:54.600]  I don't need to.
[11:54.680 --> 11:55.200]  You're gonna send me a comment.
[11:55.220 --> 11:55.420]  Gavin?
[11:56.420 --> 11:58.160]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, sure.
[11:58.540 --> 11:59.400]  I'm just making sure.
[11:59.560 --> 12:00.240]  I just don't know what you're writing.
[12:00.240 --> 12:01.160]  I don't trust that, sure.
[12:01.160 --> 12:02.200]  I don't trust that at all.
[12:02.400 --> 12:03.160]  Maybe 4pm is better.
[12:03.320 --> 12:03.740]  Like, I don't...
[12:03.740 --> 12:07.060]  I mean, who could be that precise with what's happening a month from now?
[12:07.100 --> 12:08.720]  I'm not looking for you to be precise,
[12:08.820 --> 12:12.180]  but I'm looking for you to know kind of what your Fridays are sort of like sometimes.
[12:12.340 --> 12:15.280]  And if you go, well, typically 1 to 4, I'm not usually available.
[12:15.380 --> 12:17.340]  But 4 to 7, I'm definitely available.
[12:17.420 --> 12:19.800]  You're putting a flag in the ground for MVP 2.
[12:19.900 --> 12:21.260]  I don't understand why this is an issue.
[12:21.340 --> 12:23.060]  Everything has to go around MVP 2 now.
[12:26.020 --> 12:27.680]  I don't get why this is a problem.
[12:27.800 --> 12:29.220]  If something comes up, you're like, can't do it.
[12:29.260 --> 12:30.660]  I got a MVP 2 flag down.
[12:30.680 --> 12:32.030]  Do you think, do you think...
[12:34.370 --> 12:36.150]  Nate, here's what we do.
[12:36.270 --> 12:37.050]  Gav, here's what we do.
[12:37.170 --> 12:37.630]  Here's what we do.
[12:38.210 --> 12:41.650]  Here's how we eventize it so that it's fun for us too.
[12:42.390 --> 12:43.250]  Here's what we...
[12:43.250 --> 12:44.310]  Let's launch the...
[12:44.310 --> 12:48.550]  Let's eat our beans from the bean hole while we watch MVP 2 on March 18th.
[12:48.930 --> 12:49.110]  Absolutely.
[12:49.350 --> 12:52.910]  So we need to get together two days before March 18th.
[12:52.930 --> 12:56.110]  Dig a hole, burn some wood, make some beans.
[12:57.070 --> 12:58.770]  Okay, so is that...
[12:58.770 --> 13:00.390]  So 1 to 4 works.
[13:01.270 --> 13:01.510]  Yeah.
[13:01.510 --> 13:02.050]  Yeah.
[13:02.050 --> 13:02.410]  Yeah.
[13:03.210 --> 13:04.690]  We won't need that much time.
[13:04.750 --> 13:05.550]  Yeah. I mean, yeah.
[13:05.550 --> 13:07.230]  But also, I don't know why you're asking me that.
[13:07.510 --> 13:09.730]  Because you're the only one not saying yes.
[13:09.930 --> 13:11.050]  Because you're the only one.
[13:11.310 --> 13:16.710]  Because every time I've asked, Andrew and Geoff have both said yes.
[13:16.810 --> 13:18.450]  And you have given no answer.
[13:18.710 --> 13:20.050]  I just need you to say yeah.
[13:20.550 --> 13:21.810]  Yeah, in theory, yeah.
[13:22.110 --> 13:23.450]  Are you saying we're bumpable?
[13:23.930 --> 13:25.110]  Is that what you're saying?
[13:25.470 --> 13:28.650]  That we can just be pushed to the side whenever you need to?
[13:28.850 --> 13:30.210]  That you're unwilling to?
[13:30.210 --> 13:32.290]  What if somebody sends you a save-the-date?
[13:32.410 --> 13:33.010]  What's your reply?
[13:33.170 --> 13:35.770]  Maybe, I don't know, if it's convenient for me.
[13:35.850 --> 13:38.110]  No, he'll respond with, in theory, yeah.
[13:38.470 --> 13:41.270]  Look, I'll be on a job that could potentially overrun.
[13:41.330 --> 13:42.570]  I might be in the wrong country.
[13:42.710 --> 13:43.770]  I'm just saying, yes.
[13:44.130 --> 13:44.870]  That's fine.
[13:45.110 --> 13:46.410]  That's a reason to bump it.
[13:46.550 --> 13:51.610]  I'm saying your Fridays at that time, typically, would that work for you?
[13:51.910 --> 13:54.950]  I would love you to have my life and receive that question.
[13:56.950 --> 13:59.570]  And I think Eric would love a yes or no answer.
[14:00.510 --> 14:01.610]  I'm saying yes.
[14:01.650 --> 14:02.590]  I mean, in general, yes.
[14:02.590 --> 14:03.450]  That's it. That's it.
[14:03.790 --> 14:04.770]  No, that's it.
[14:04.850 --> 14:06.310]  But what you just said is what I needed.
[14:06.630 --> 14:07.050]  And that's it.
[14:07.210 --> 14:10.130]  When can I confidently schedule you on something?
[14:10.610 --> 14:11.510]  What's the latest?
[14:11.930 --> 14:12.870]  Is it three days?
[14:13.090 --> 14:14.090]  Like, when could I...
[14:14.090 --> 14:15.250]  When is a yes a yes?
[14:16.310 --> 14:18.910]  Any time from today until the end of the day, I'm all yours.
[14:19.410 --> 14:20.330]  So it's one day.
[14:20.450 --> 14:21.690]  It's a one-day schedule.
[14:22.250 --> 14:23.670]  I mean, that's a safe bet.
[14:24.110 --> 14:24.430]  Okay.
[14:25.010 --> 14:25.750]  I was just curious.
[14:26.290 --> 14:26.790]  How safe?
[14:27.290 --> 14:28.010]  Safer than tomorrow.
[14:32.210 --> 14:35.010]  I want to see a graph of, like, statistically,
[14:35.010 --> 14:39.090]  the probability of it working for each day as it gets further out.
[14:39.210 --> 14:42.110]  From like a 100% to a 90, 80.
[14:42.950 --> 14:44.310]  Four days ahead, zero.
[14:44.430 --> 14:45.030]  This is 0%.
[14:45.030 --> 14:48.930]  A great example is Eric said, can you do Vegas in June?
[14:49.390 --> 14:49.610]  Right?
[14:49.690 --> 14:52.990]  Now, imagine every single thing in your life was that question.
[14:52.990 --> 14:54.930]  And you end up just being like, yeah, maybe.
[14:55.070 --> 14:55.230]  Sure.
[14:55.530 --> 14:55.830]  Who knows?
[14:56.450 --> 14:57.130]  I get that.
[14:57.270 --> 15:00.250]  But there's also caveats to you doing these things.
[15:00.250 --> 15:04.870]  And those are the things around it that I'm mostly concerned with.
[15:05.370 --> 15:08.170]  If whether or not you're in the country, that makes sense.
[15:08.590 --> 15:09.350]  That's fine.
[15:09.590 --> 15:16.270]  I'm saying, in general, one to four, or like maybe a four to seven or something.
[15:16.530 --> 15:21.690]  But also, it's on the calendar now, but I've also scheduled Beanhole for you and Geoff
[15:21.690 --> 15:23.770]  from five to six on Wednesday.
[15:24.350 --> 15:27.230]  That's just a space that I saw and I took advantage of.
[15:27.510 --> 15:28.830]  You do with that what you get.
[15:32.190 --> 15:34.810]  That's just me being preemptive, right?
[15:34.910 --> 15:38.390]  I didn't need a yes or a no for that, because that to me is a theoretical.
[15:38.790 --> 15:40.910]  That's up to you guys if you want to do beans.
[15:47.260 --> 15:48.280]  I wish so much.
[15:49.680 --> 15:51.100]  This is just the best.
[15:54.820 --> 15:55.620]  I understand.
[15:55.760 --> 16:00.760]  Hey, Gavin, I understand if we get to even the week of or three weeks before or whatever,
[16:00.860 --> 16:02.420]  and you go, hey, I can't.
[16:02.460 --> 16:04.620]  That's completely understandable to me.
[16:05.600 --> 16:08.480]  I'm not looking for you to 100% commit.
[16:09.200 --> 16:10.900]  What level of commitment is this?
[16:11.020 --> 16:11.180]  Yes.
[16:11.400 --> 16:15.260]  Oh, I would say that I would love to only do this in life.
[16:17.440 --> 16:18.840]  I wish that was real.
[16:19.020 --> 16:19.900]  Me too, man.
[16:20.720 --> 16:21.520]  Completely understand.
[16:21.840 --> 16:22.240]  Completely.
[16:22.780 --> 16:23.260]  I'm just curious.
[16:23.540 --> 16:24.000]  I'm not.
[16:24.080 --> 16:24.700]  I apologize.
[16:24.980 --> 16:25.480]  I'm coming.
[16:25.560 --> 16:26.240]  I'm being aggressive.
[16:26.520 --> 16:27.160]  I'm on payments.
[16:27.320 --> 16:29.480]  I'm sorry I said I'd throw hot sauce in your face, Gavin.
[16:29.700 --> 16:30.380]  I love you.
[16:30.580 --> 16:31.360]  If you guys...
[16:31.360 --> 16:32.700]  I'm not trying to be antagonizing.
[16:32.700 --> 16:33.760]  I'm genuinely curious.
[16:33.920 --> 16:35.740]  What percentage would you say that yes is?
[16:35.860 --> 16:38.440]  If you owe out of 100, 100, would you say that's a yes?
[16:38.500 --> 16:39.640]  That's like a 30%?
[16:40.140 --> 16:41.780]  Like, what level are we talking here?
[16:43.680 --> 16:45.480]  Uh, try to get an 80.
[16:46.300 --> 16:47.040]  That's great.
[16:47.220 --> 16:48.260]  I like those odds.
[16:48.440 --> 16:49.220]  I would take those odds.
[16:49.360 --> 16:51.240]  Can I, can I, can I, can I break it?
[16:51.700 --> 16:53.660]  I'm not going to put anything on that date.
[16:53.800 --> 16:55.780]  It's only if other shit goes wrong.
[16:56.100 --> 16:56.380]  Right.
[16:56.420 --> 16:56.900]  Of course.
[16:57.220 --> 16:57.520]  Totally.
[16:57.640 --> 16:59.180]  Again, absolutely understandable.
[16:59.720 --> 17:00.640]  Completely get it.
[17:00.640 --> 17:06.340]  As someone who has been in your position, Eric, in the past with Gavin's schedule for
[17:06.340 --> 17:07.420]  years and years and years.
[17:09.080 --> 17:14.020]  First off, you, you have my sympathy and complete and total commiseration and understanding.
[17:14.440 --> 17:20.300]  But what I would like to add to it is I think Gavin is optimistically full of shit when
[17:20.300 --> 17:20.980]  he says 80%.
[17:20.980 --> 17:25.200]  I would put it at no greater than 24%.
[17:25.780 --> 17:26.560]  Here's why you're wrong.
[17:26.700 --> 17:27.440]  Here's why you're wrong.
[17:27.440 --> 17:32.280]  I've had, I've had stuff clash with every single live event we've ever done.
[17:32.680 --> 17:34.320]  I don't, I don't ever want to be on the marketing.
[17:34.480 --> 17:35.980]  I don't want to let people down if they think I'm there.
[17:36.060 --> 17:36.460]  I'm not there.
[17:37.340 --> 17:40.440]  Any, you know, anything, someone could come in, there's stuff scheduled at the same time.
[17:40.460 --> 17:41.800]  You try and try and move stuff around.
[17:42.900 --> 17:45.160]  Yet, attended every single one.
[17:45.660 --> 17:45.820]  Yeah.
[17:45.820 --> 17:47.400]  Cause we weren't expecting you to show up.
[17:48.400 --> 17:49.280]  What does that mean?
[17:49.480 --> 17:50.860]  We weren't counting on it.
[17:51.140 --> 17:52.460]  Cause you were like a maybe.
[17:52.980 --> 17:53.340]  Right.
[17:53.500 --> 17:54.060]  But I went.
[17:54.720 --> 17:55.140]  I'm saying...
[17:55.140 --> 17:56.020]  But you were never a yes.
[17:56.020 --> 17:57.920]  I know, but I'm saying it.
[17:57.920 --> 17:59.400]  It was like, I'm going to try and be there.
[17:59.440 --> 18:00.720]  I'm saying a maybe.
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.580]  I'm saying a maybe I give you a 70%.
[18:03.580 --> 18:05.140]  A yes, 24%.
[18:05.140 --> 18:06.320]  What does that mean?
[18:07.060 --> 18:08.180]  What are you talking about?
[18:08.180 --> 18:09.360]  It's all the same thing.
[18:09.900 --> 18:10.680]  Not with you.
[18:11.600 --> 18:12.560]  I want to do all of it.
[18:12.620 --> 18:13.200]  That's the problem.
[18:13.420 --> 18:14.420]  No, I understand.
[18:14.620 --> 18:15.520]  It's not a judgment.
[18:15.960 --> 18:19.360]  It's just, I'm just laying out the facts as I've experienced them in the past.
[18:19.680 --> 18:23.420]  Listen, nobody gets your hectic lifestyle better.
[18:23.560 --> 18:24.560]  And I sound like Trump when I say that.
[18:24.560 --> 18:27.100]  I understand your hectic lifestyle.
[18:27.280 --> 18:27.800]  I do.
[18:28.200 --> 18:29.140]  I really do.
[18:29.400 --> 18:31.680]  I've been where you are.
[18:31.920 --> 18:33.240]  Maybe not to the degree that you're in.
[18:33.320 --> 18:35.180]  But you know, we've all been in this industry for a long time.
[18:35.460 --> 18:37.460]  And I have a tremendous amount of sympathy.
[18:37.720 --> 18:42.060]  I just think with you, a maybe is closer to a yes than a yes is.
[18:46.420 --> 18:48.780]  Yeah, I just don't want to let people down.
[18:48.860 --> 18:50.740]  So I'm very wary of saying a straight yes.
[18:50.740 --> 18:55.000]  When there's varying percentages based on how far away it is.
[18:55.420 --> 18:58.860]  I think it's very funny that like learning if you're going to be at a thing or not
[18:58.860 --> 19:02.340]  is equal to me learning if it's going to fucking like rain on Friday.
[19:02.620 --> 19:03.780]  Like it's a 40%.
[19:03.780 --> 19:07.520]  It's like you're a weather program of attendance.
[19:07.880 --> 19:09.520]  But I don't blame you in any way for it.
[19:09.600 --> 19:11.980]  It's like the KXAN AccuGavin forecast.
[19:15.960 --> 19:20.320]  And that's fine if we have to move MVP too, because something happens on that.
[19:20.800 --> 19:24.020]  On that day, at that time, we can do that.
[19:24.420 --> 19:27.400]  I just wanted to go in with the best odds.
[19:27.940 --> 19:32.240]  And if you felt like the odds are in favor for one to four, great.
[19:32.440 --> 19:37.600]  But if you feel like four to seven is a better odds for us, that's really what I'm getting at.
[19:37.780 --> 19:41.060]  Yeah, Eric just said, if you think something comes up in your life
[19:41.060 --> 19:45.140]  that will push back the homeless skateboarding monkey movie, that's okay.
[19:47.820 --> 19:50.100]  I mean, I've come back for equally meanly stuff.
[19:50.100 --> 19:52.680]  There was one week where I was working in LA,
[19:52.960 --> 19:55.700]  but because I'd already started the Destiny Raid in a video,
[19:55.900 --> 19:59.540]  I had to red-eye back to Austin twice in the same week.
[19:59.980 --> 20:03.060]  There were two nights in the same week where I slept in the sky.
[20:03.560 --> 20:04.680]  Like it was too much.
[20:05.880 --> 20:06.280]  Nobody.
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.940]  I don't want you to do that for MVP too, do you understand?
[20:11.320 --> 20:13.000]  I mean, that's how much I would want to be in it.
[20:13.160 --> 20:14.300]  I don't want that.
[20:14.440 --> 20:15.800]  Andrew might and Geoff might.
[20:15.900 --> 20:16.680]  I don't.
[20:16.980 --> 20:19.820]  I'd like to go on record as saying I actually do want that.
[20:20.920 --> 20:23.880]  Not just because of, not just because of MVP too,
[20:24.120 --> 20:26.620]  but also because there's a bean expectation now,
[20:26.800 --> 20:31.940]  and I feel like it's piling up to the point where now I'm emotionally invested in MVP too,
[20:32.260 --> 20:36.360]  because it's a vehicle to get my decade-long bean desire fulfilled.
[20:36.780 --> 20:37.560]  It's on the calendar.
[20:38.100 --> 20:38.760]  It's on the calendar.
[20:39.160 --> 20:41.920]  Nothing would make me happier than if you do the bean hole,
[20:42.040 --> 20:43.180]  and then Gavin can't make it,
[20:43.240 --> 20:46.460]  and you just have to live with the fact you got beans in a hole you can't eat.
[20:52.240 --> 20:54.940]  Oh, well, that's a shitload of stuff that I don't want to miss,
[20:54.940 --> 20:56.200]  so I'm going to say 80 percent.
[20:57.160 --> 20:58.900]  Okay, just say maybe.
[21:00.160 --> 21:03.480]  It's a bunch of stuff I don't want to miss 80 percent.
[21:05.960 --> 21:07.460]  Can we just recap everything?
[21:07.800 --> 21:12.500]  So on Tuesday morning at 8 a.m. central, we're recording a whole episode.
[21:12.960 --> 21:13.080]  Yes.
[21:13.480 --> 21:18.100]  Then at 11 p.m. central, we're recording a second episode on Tuesday.
[21:18.200 --> 21:19.780]  Both on the calendar right now, correct.
[21:19.780 --> 21:25.160]  Then on Thursday, we're recording one more episode at a standard regulation time.
[21:25.160 --> 21:26.440]  At our regulation time.
[21:26.560 --> 21:32.680]  And then on March 18th, we're going to eat beans and watch MVP 2,
[21:32.840 --> 21:37.780]  and then in Q4 of 2022, we'll have a Vegas event.
[21:38.420 --> 21:39.680]  That's where we are.
[21:39.920 --> 21:41.520]  Easy. We got it all scheduled.
[21:41.960 --> 21:43.460]  Oh my god!
[21:43.540 --> 21:44.320]  What's happening?
[21:44.620 --> 21:45.200]  What the fuck?
[21:45.900 --> 21:47.480]  Was it too much?
[21:47.560 --> 21:48.320]  What happened?
[21:48.960 --> 21:49.640]  I'm the one.
[21:49.900 --> 21:54.480]  Is this is going to go up as like scheduling?
[21:55.100 --> 21:59.000]  Yes. Yeah, this is it.
[21:59.220 --> 22:02.400]  This is I mean, like we're just called Eric's job.
[22:02.460 --> 22:03.020]  Yeah, really?
[22:03.160 --> 22:04.440]  Just Eric's job supplemental.
[22:05.740 --> 22:07.620]  Eric's job supplemental.
[22:09.180 --> 22:09.700]  Great.
[22:13.300 --> 22:15.420]  We titled it a Q&A with Eric.
[22:15.420 --> 22:18.960]  The first question is what is your job like?
[22:18.960 --> 22:23.600]  It's me asking all the questions and also trying to give all the answers.
[22:26.840 --> 22:31.200]  OK, so as always, if any of that needs to change,
[22:31.360 --> 22:33.160]  please let me know as soon as possible.
[22:35.340 --> 22:36.960]  I'll keep you up to date.
[22:37.040 --> 22:38.580]  Thank you very much.
[22:39.600 --> 22:40.360]  We won't.
[22:41.920 --> 22:42.380]  What do you mean?
[22:42.440 --> 22:44.160]  I'm always talking to Eric about the schedule.
[22:44.680 --> 22:45.980]  Yeah, it's true.
[22:46.100 --> 22:49.940]  I can't fault you for being you're not shady with your schedule.
[22:50.060 --> 22:52.140]  You're very forthcoming and that's great.
[22:52.300 --> 22:53.960]  And that's why I felt like I could ask you.
[22:54.120 --> 22:55.460]  I pass it straight on.
[22:55.800 --> 22:57.640]  Yep. And that's why I felt like I could ask you.
[22:57.760 --> 23:02.020]  Do you think the odds are in our favor for one to four on March 18th?
[23:02.820 --> 23:04.660]  I'm going to get so much shit if I can't be there.
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.160]  But I want you to know if you can't be there, that's OK.
[23:11.420 --> 23:12.460]  We can reschedule.
[23:12.460 --> 23:15.480]  If oh, if Gavin can't be there.
[23:15.840 --> 23:16.160]  Andrew, what?
[23:16.760 --> 23:20.300]  I knocked over this giant cup of water like 30 seconds ago,
[23:20.320 --> 23:24.880]  and I'm frantically looking for a towel and it just it started rolling over the edge.
[23:25.260 --> 23:26.600]  So I've now slid into my desk.
[23:26.680 --> 23:28.740]  It's just I'm absorbing it in my underwear at the moment.
[23:29.160 --> 23:30.180]  You're going to hurt your other ankle.
[23:30.300 --> 23:30.760]  What's there?
[23:31.140 --> 23:32.000]  No, I'm in a chair.
[23:32.080 --> 23:34.140]  I just don't I'm going to I got to slide to the bathroom.
[23:34.200 --> 23:34.620]  I'll be back.
[23:35.120 --> 23:36.200]  I can bring you with me.
[23:36.460 --> 23:38.000]  Actually, you don't have to.
[23:38.220 --> 23:38.460]  We're done.
[23:38.900 --> 23:39.860]  This is it.
[23:39.860 --> 23:41.440]  We stopped an hour ago.
[23:41.780 --> 23:42.720]  Everything's recapped.
[23:42.780 --> 23:43.320]  We're good.
[23:45.040 --> 23:48.820]  Just just so we just so we know, though, if Gavin can't be there on March 18th,
[23:48.820 --> 23:52.900]  I would like us to continue to record something about how he's not there.
[23:52.940 --> 23:53.840]  Oh, 100 percent.
[23:54.120 --> 23:57.580]  Like if Gavin's not there, we can still keep that on the calendar.
[23:57.920 --> 23:58.900]  Yeah, we'll just do something else.
[23:59.520 --> 24:00.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:00.900 --> 24:02.900]  We'll make that we got the date locked in.
[24:03.880 --> 24:05.020]  So the pressure.
[24:06.820 --> 24:08.020]  I'm going to be so freaked out.
[24:08.420 --> 24:09.600]  Show up or don't, Gavin.
[24:09.600 --> 24:11.100]  We're going to have a blast either way.
[24:11.440 --> 24:13.040]  Show up or don't.
[24:13.160 --> 24:14.260]  Oh, my God.
[24:14.380 --> 24:15.880]  I can smell a red eye in my future.
[24:16.340 --> 24:18.400]  No, you don't have to do that.
[24:21.100 --> 24:22.340]  Oh, my God.
[24:22.500 --> 24:23.640]  What is he doing?
[24:24.440 --> 24:26.940]  This, by the way, I don't know if you picked up on that,
[24:27.360 --> 24:30.480]  but that means Andrew just performed this entire podcast.
[24:30.620 --> 24:31.320]  Donald Duck in it.
[24:31.560 --> 24:32.880]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:32.880 --> 24:33.700]  No, I'm wearing underwear.
[24:34.420 --> 24:35.200]  He was poo bound.
[24:35.580 --> 24:36.420]  He was wearing his...
[24:37.080 --> 24:41.060]  I just said I slid my chair forward so it would go into the fabric.
[24:41.500 --> 24:42.860]  But you're in a shirt in your underwear, right?
[24:43.360 --> 24:43.560]  Yeah.
[24:44.520 --> 24:45.320]  Oh, man.
[24:45.800 --> 24:47.100]  Does anybody else wear clothes?
[24:47.560 --> 24:47.920]  Everybody else wears clothes?
[24:48.580 --> 24:49.900]  I've got a hoodie and sweatpants on.
[24:50.120 --> 24:50.920]  My house is freezing.
[24:51.580 --> 24:52.300]  Oh, do you not have power?
[24:52.780 --> 24:54.360]  I mean, I don't have heat.
[24:55.120 --> 24:55.980]  Oh, that's so sad.
[24:56.380 --> 24:57.800]  He needs to be able to jerk off.
[24:58.120 --> 24:58.820]  We established this.
[25:00.660 --> 25:01.060]  Okay.
[25:01.520 --> 25:02.280]  All right, let's go.
[25:02.440 --> 25:02.620]  We're done.
[25:02.900 --> 25:03.780]  This is done.
[25:03.940 --> 25:04.760]  Thank you very much.
[25:05.440 --> 25:06.480]  Oh, my God.
[25:07.860 --> 25:09.160]  Am I wrong?
[25:09.560 --> 25:11.080]  We went over this.
