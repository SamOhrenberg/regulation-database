[00:05.530 --> 00:07.730]  Hello! It's coming hoooome!
[00:08.390 --> 00:09.870]  That's-a how it goes!
[00:10.110 --> 00:13.810]  Welcome to, uh, the RTX at Home edition of...
[00:15.310 --> 00:17.070]  Face Break Shit...
[00:17.070 --> 00:19.470]  Again Still, I think is what this one is.
[00:19.550 --> 00:20.270]  I do the sounds.
[00:20.410 --> 00:24.110]  Uh, that's true. Well, some would argue that you're not technically here right now.
[00:24.110 --> 00:25.950]  I will be, I will be in about half an hour.
[00:26.070 --> 00:29.770]  Alright, here, uh, I feel like I should start Plug Face Off...
[00:29.770 --> 00:30.750]  Oh, I don't have the button anymore.
[00:30.750 --> 00:33.010]  I feel like I should start this off with a couple of things.
[00:33.210 --> 00:36.330]  One, I'm gonna just come out of the gate with an apology right now.
[00:36.990 --> 00:39.930]  Nothing has ever gone right in my life.
[00:40.990 --> 00:48.090]  And I should have realized four months ago when Clarissa came to me and asked if we wanted to do a panel at RTX.
[00:48.330 --> 00:52.210]  And I said, well, I don't want to do a panel per se, but maybe we'll do like a break shit or something.
[00:52.510 --> 00:55.210]  She said, that sounds lovely. We scheduled it. We put it on the books.
[00:55.790 --> 00:59.330]  I didn't anticipate England making it all the way to the Euro Cup!
[00:59.330 --> 01:01.230]  No one is watching this right now.
[01:01.390 --> 01:03.730]  That's my fault. That's on me. I'm sorry.
[01:03.890 --> 01:05.410]  I'm not even watching this right now.
[01:05.610 --> 01:07.970]  Yes, you, yeah. So Gavin's here, sort of.
[01:08.890 --> 01:09.690]  Don't show that!
[01:12.430 --> 01:13.550]  Alright, we're on again!
[01:14.530 --> 01:15.350]  Go on, son!
[01:16.330 --> 01:17.730]  What's gonna happen when they score?
[01:18.370 --> 01:21.430]  Uh, I don't, well, you know, it's England, so they probably won't.
[01:21.490 --> 01:22.070]  It's probably gonna happen.
[01:22.070 --> 01:22.670]  They won't have to worry about it.
[01:22.750 --> 01:23.370]  They scored once already.
[01:24.130 --> 01:27.610]  I hear, uh, I hear this, uh, it's quite the ticket.
[01:27.610 --> 01:31.010]  Is Andrew there? Can we hear and see Andrew? Or can we hear Andrew?
[01:31.270 --> 01:32.210]  Andrew, can you hear us?
[01:33.310 --> 01:35.850]  Mike, just right, I just, I just heard...
[01:38.230 --> 01:44.120]  Hey, we hear you!
[01:45.540 --> 01:46.940]  Oh, Andrew, we're so glad.
[01:47.460 --> 01:49.180]  We're so glad to have you here.
[01:49.340 --> 01:50.060]  Here's the thing.
[01:50.240 --> 01:56.100]  Geoff was complaining that he can't do the face noise.
[01:56.100 --> 02:01.240]  But that's okay, because if you're watching this at home, you can!
[02:01.500 --> 02:07.160]  By going to store.roosterteeth.com right now, because on sale now, can you believe this?
[02:08.640 --> 02:09.120]  The...
[02:09.120 --> 02:10.080]  Face button.
[02:11.320 --> 02:11.800]  And...
[02:11.800 --> 02:13.700]  Face, left socks.
[02:14.000 --> 02:14.820]  Two left socks.
[02:15.240 --> 02:17.680]  If you wanna buy two fuckin' face buttons.
[02:17.960 --> 02:18.900]  I'll tell you right now.
[02:18.920 --> 02:20.040]  Oh, this is the best.
[02:20.300 --> 02:21.180]  I'll tell you right now.
[02:21.240 --> 02:22.380]  I'm fuckin' wearin' them.
[02:22.400 --> 02:23.020]  Dude, that's what's up.
[02:23.040 --> 02:25.120]  I put my money where my foot is.
[02:25.120 --> 02:27.080]  They are on right now.
[02:27.180 --> 02:29.560]  Dude, the higher the socks, the downer the fool.
[02:29.760 --> 02:31.280]  The higher the socks, the downer the fool.
[02:31.620 --> 02:33.120]  You wanna see? I'll even show you an exclusive.
[02:33.820 --> 02:34.540]  Uh, fuckin'...
[02:34.540 --> 02:35.080]  Check this out.
[02:35.480 --> 02:36.200]  You've never seen...
[02:36.760 --> 02:37.560]  You've never even seen...
[02:37.560 --> 02:39.160]  There's the Gavin loser nose.
[02:39.700 --> 02:40.460]  Have you ever seen the goose?
[02:40.540 --> 02:42.500]  Have you ever seen my fart hard tattoo?
[02:43.180 --> 02:44.340]  Right on my ankle, yeah?
[02:44.520 --> 02:45.520]  A little peaky for you.
[02:45.520 --> 02:46.820]  On the other side, it says, uh...
[02:46.820 --> 02:47.800]  You guys familiar with Taco Bell?
[02:47.900 --> 02:48.060]  Yeah.
[02:48.520 --> 02:49.800]  I have a lived soft.
[02:49.900 --> 02:50.460]  Oh, that's cool.
[02:52.540 --> 02:54.260]  Gavin just spit...
[02:54.260 --> 02:55.140]  Live soft?
[02:56.560 --> 02:58.200]  It's a fuckin' Taco Bell commercial.
[02:58.300 --> 03:00.820]  So here's the thing that we found out about these socks.
[03:01.160 --> 03:02.500]  They are two left socks.
[03:02.580 --> 03:03.380]  Yes, I...
[03:04.200 --> 03:04.520]  However...
[03:05.580 --> 03:05.900]  Well...
[03:05.900 --> 03:08.200]  Okay, I'm gonna jump in. I'm gonna take over that.
[03:08.200 --> 03:08.880]  Is there a thing with these socks?
[03:08.880 --> 03:10.100]  I got a bit of a story.
[03:10.180 --> 03:10.500]  Uh-huh.
[03:10.940 --> 03:14.540]  First off, typically when we do a break show, they go two hours.
[03:14.660 --> 03:15.960]  We don't have two hours, we're gonna do it in an hour.
[03:16.020 --> 03:19.580]  So we decided to cut out all the talking, all the stories, and get straight to the cards.
[03:19.660 --> 03:19.800]  Right.
[03:20.340 --> 03:22.300]  But we're not doing that because I'm telling the story now for some reason.
[03:22.300 --> 03:22.800]  Okay.
[03:23.080 --> 03:25.440]  The whole point of these socks is that I have this...
[03:25.440 --> 03:27.200]  If you follow our podcast...
[03:27.200 --> 03:27.500]  This is the best.
[03:27.520 --> 03:30.240]  If you follow our podcast, I have an issue with left and right socks.
[03:30.440 --> 03:32.300]  I've never put the correct socks on.
[03:32.400 --> 03:33.220]  Well, once it happened.
[03:33.700 --> 03:36.060]  Uh, I don't want to spoil the stories if you want to go back and listen.
[03:36.120 --> 03:37.220]  But for years, it didn't.
[03:37.760 --> 03:40.240]  I thought it'd be great to make two left socks...
[03:40.240 --> 03:40.340]  Yeah.
[03:40.460 --> 03:44.740]  ...for Fuckface, so that anytime you put a sock on, you're always putting the left sock on.
[03:45.140 --> 03:46.680]  Put these on for the first time today.
[03:46.820 --> 03:47.680]  You can...
[03:47.680 --> 03:49.400]  Put them on for the very first time today.
[03:49.400 --> 03:51.680]  Is it printed on a different sock?
[03:51.960 --> 03:54.980]  And here's what I noticed.
[03:55.660 --> 03:56.060]  No!
[03:56.460 --> 03:57.260]  That's not the problem.
[03:57.600 --> 03:58.780]  Because they're two left socks, right?
[03:58.900 --> 04:02.100]  Like, here's Geoff walking this way, and then here's Geoff walking that way.
[04:02.340 --> 04:03.240]  But, uh...
[04:03.240 --> 04:04.840]  But if you do like this...
[04:04.840 --> 04:06.880]  Then you can't put them on inside out!
[04:07.060 --> 04:08.900]  I can still do the goddamn socks wrong!
[04:09.000 --> 04:09.600]  And I did!
[04:09.780 --> 04:10.560]  I still...
[04:10.560 --> 04:13.440]  I future-proofed my own feet, and I fucked it up!
[04:13.620 --> 04:15.300]  I should have put this on both sides!
[04:15.600 --> 04:17.360]  So you can buy those left socks.
[04:17.480 --> 04:18.700]  They won't solve your problem.
[04:18.700 --> 04:20.640]  So they're two left socks with a left and a right.
[04:20.960 --> 04:22.460]  Yeah, they're two left and right left socks.
[04:22.860 --> 04:23.260]  Worthless.
[04:24.360 --> 04:26.680]  So if that's not the most fuck-faced product...
[04:26.680 --> 04:31.580]  Between that and the Waffle Balm that is the most poorly reviewed thing on the store...
[04:31.580 --> 04:33.560]  That we promoted for two hours that was out of stock?
[04:33.720 --> 04:34.320]  It's out of stock!
[04:34.780 --> 04:34.940]  Yeah.
[04:35.500 --> 04:37.180]  G Fuel, though, we're...
[04:37.180 --> 04:37.740]  This stuff's good.
[04:39.740 --> 04:41.080]  I'm just having sour cherry.
[04:43.820 --> 04:44.760]  Oh my god.
[04:44.800 --> 04:46.280]  How are you, Andrew? How's it going up here?
[04:46.400 --> 04:46.800]  I'm great!
[04:46.800 --> 04:47.460]  Nice!
[04:48.380 --> 04:49.900]  Fantastic! Yeah, those are great socks.
[04:50.140 --> 04:52.000]  I got sent a pair. They're amazing.
[04:52.220 --> 04:53.060]  Are you watching the game?
[04:54.180 --> 04:57.420]  No, I didn't even know the game was on. I learned the game was on from your text.
[04:57.640 --> 04:58.020]  Oh, okay.
[04:58.040 --> 04:59.040]  I didn't realize there was something to miss.
[04:59.320 --> 05:02.740]  And if you're wondering what this has to do with the podcast fuck-face...
[05:03.880 --> 05:04.240]  Good.
[05:04.540 --> 05:06.960]  The podcast has turned into...
[05:06.960 --> 05:09.000]  That podcast, if you've never listened to it, I recommend it.
[05:09.200 --> 05:12.300]  It's turned into a three-way, sometimes four- and five-way fight...
[05:12.300 --> 05:15.000]  Between Nick, Eric, Gavin, Andrew, and I.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.560]  Boy, are we in a big one. Have we been in a big one lately?
[05:18.340 --> 05:20.360]  Definitely the most uncomfortable episode we've ever made.
[05:20.880 --> 05:23.600]  In about three weeks, you're gonna hear exactly why.
[05:23.700 --> 05:25.900]  And you might think to yourself, what does that have to do...
[05:25.900 --> 05:28.220]  These guys just shit in each other's mouths for two hours a week.
[05:28.380 --> 05:29.580]  What does that have to do with baseball cards?
[05:29.780 --> 05:32.300]  It doesn't, but sometimes we talk about Don Zimmer...
[05:33.900 --> 05:34.680]  Rest his soul.
[05:35.620 --> 05:37.280]  I mean, he's watching over you.
[05:37.640 --> 05:39.260]  And he's wearing RTX merchandise.
[05:39.960 --> 05:42.520]  And he's wearing the sweet RTX merchandise.
[05:42.700 --> 05:43.000]  I love it.
[05:43.960 --> 05:44.840]  We like Don Zimmer.
[05:45.040 --> 05:48.080]  So, by the transit of property, we open up Twin Peaks cards.
[05:48.100 --> 05:50.880]  Please open one of your 12-packs that you've been itching to open.
[05:51.120 --> 05:53.180]  So we're gonna blow through it, because we got a lot of stuff.
[05:53.460 --> 05:54.780]  I promised Twin Peaks for Gavin.
[05:55.020 --> 05:56.780]  I promised Umbrella Academy for Geoff.
[05:56.860 --> 05:58.660]  I got Game of Thrones, I don't know if we'll get to it.
[05:58.860 --> 06:00.520]  I got more James Bond for Gavin.
[06:00.660 --> 06:04.840]  I got soccer for... I don't know, Eric, I guess.
[06:05.000 --> 06:05.800]  Andrew's in Canada.
[06:06.460 --> 06:08.440]  Eric, you've been to three fucking soccer games last week.
[06:08.460 --> 06:09.620]  Yeah, so I don't have to watch the England game.
[06:09.900 --> 06:10.240]  Boring.
[06:10.960 --> 06:13.740]  So we'll start, as we do with all things, we're looking for a Zim.
[06:14.100 --> 06:16.940]  We've never not had a Zimmer.
[06:17.720 --> 06:22.000]  When you hit that earlier and they were in the host segment, it stopped everything.
[06:22.140 --> 06:24.740]  I thought, I wonder if this is on. And then Mike got the blame for it.
[06:24.840 --> 06:25.160]  Brilliant.
[06:26.380 --> 06:26.840]  Sorry, Mike.
[06:26.960 --> 06:27.620]  Alright, so let's go.
[06:27.620 --> 06:28.340]  Okay, here we go.
[06:28.420 --> 06:29.420]  We're gonna go through our first pack.
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.620]  Oh, look at that. We got the camera figured out.
[06:32.700 --> 06:34.580]  Oh, he's got a mouthful.
[06:34.580 --> 06:35.040]  John Kelly.
[06:35.360 --> 06:36.080]  John Kruk.
[06:36.200 --> 06:36.760]  I like John Kruk.
[06:36.780 --> 06:40.860]  John Kruk, one of the redneckier baseball players of all time.
[06:41.020 --> 06:41.800]  And kind of lovely.
[06:42.940 --> 06:44.380]  Oh, Alex Fernandez, rookie.
[06:45.180 --> 06:45.640]  Greg Vaughn.
[06:45.720 --> 06:46.240]  He was a great player.
[06:46.360 --> 06:46.780]  Dave Smith.
[06:47.560 --> 06:48.760]  Paul gets an upside down.
[06:48.960 --> 06:50.580]  This is inverted, that means it's satanic.
[06:50.760 --> 06:51.660]  Is that the same high leg?
[06:52.300 --> 06:52.660]  Griffey!
[06:52.660 --> 06:53.260]  Oh, Griffey!
[06:53.280 --> 06:54.160]  That's a real card.
[06:55.560 --> 06:56.640]  Not looking at a...
[06:57.160 --> 06:57.840]  No, no Zim.
[06:57.980 --> 07:00.580]  I would like to keep that full of mouth one.
[07:00.900 --> 07:01.720]  Yeah, yeah, I set it aside.
[07:01.720 --> 07:06.680]  I think we should potentially rank the most stuff in people's mouths as we find them.
[07:06.740 --> 07:07.220]  Oh, that's good.
[07:07.280 --> 07:08.440]  Another thing to add to your list.
[07:08.740 --> 07:09.420]  That's a great idea.
[07:09.540 --> 07:10.620]  Okay, here we go.
[07:11.060 --> 07:13.040]  Geoff was pulling stuff out before we started.
[07:13.200 --> 07:14.680]  He went, is this episode one or episode two?
[07:14.840 --> 07:15.680]  Why did we keep this?
[07:17.200 --> 07:19.300]  Greg Geoffries, what a letdown his career was.
[07:19.340 --> 07:20.000]  Terry Steinbach.
[07:20.460 --> 07:21.140]  Barry Jones.
[07:21.260 --> 07:22.040]  Mike Gallego.
[07:22.860 --> 07:23.740]  Mike Geoffcoat.
[07:23.820 --> 07:25.620]  Wes Chamberlain looking tough as nails.
[07:26.100 --> 07:28.500]  Sean Bossky looking kind of like a pervert.
[07:29.140 --> 07:30.860]  Roberto Kelly was a great player.
[07:30.860 --> 07:32.160]  Danny Gladden.
[07:32.340 --> 07:33.320]  Greg Harris.
[07:34.080 --> 07:35.680]  I'm pretty sure we interviewed Greg Harris.
[07:35.840 --> 07:39.320]  That's the name of the guy that created the VelociCoaster, right?
[07:39.580 --> 07:42.280]  Yeah, that's Greg Harris, former San Diego Padres pitcher.
[07:42.560 --> 07:43.020]  Dwayne Henry.
[07:43.040 --> 07:44.160]  Created the VelociCoaster.
[07:44.640 --> 07:45.060]  Pretty sure.
[07:45.180 --> 07:45.980]  Well, but two more.
[07:46.260 --> 07:47.500]  Is that fact behind that?
[07:47.600 --> 07:49.640]  No, we interviewed a guy named Greg Harris three weeks ago.
[07:49.680 --> 07:50.140]  Oh, okay.
[07:51.140 --> 07:54.020]  Who happened to be the art director of the VelociCoaster.
[07:54.040 --> 07:54.440]  What's the score?
[07:55.220 --> 07:56.200]  It's 1-1 in extra time.
[07:56.320 --> 07:56.920]  All right.
[07:57.880 --> 07:58.680]  Kurt Wilkerson.
[07:58.920 --> 07:59.860]  We got Rob Ducey.
[07:59.860 --> 08:00.600]  Rob Ducey.
[08:00.640 --> 08:00.820]  Okay.
[08:01.000 --> 08:01.860]  Geoff Manto.
[08:03.140 --> 08:03.940]  Manto Toboggan.
[08:04.300 --> 08:04.360]  Sparky!
[08:04.880 --> 08:05.480]  Sparky Anderson!
[08:05.740 --> 08:06.940]  Sparky is up there!
[08:07.280 --> 08:07.480]  Surprise!
[08:07.680 --> 08:08.320]  Sparky Anderson.
[08:08.500 --> 08:09.740]  Sparky Anderson has got...
[08:09.740 --> 08:11.140]  I'm getting real Zim vibes.
[08:11.460 --> 08:13.820]  Do you think Sparky Anderson lived through that photo shoot?
[08:14.500 --> 08:14.900]  Wow.
[08:15.440 --> 08:16.240]  Steve Olin.
[08:16.380 --> 08:17.040]  Scott Aldrin.
[08:17.360 --> 08:19.700]  Somebody look it up and see if he died one second after that was taken.
[08:19.740 --> 08:20.640]  Ricky Jordan.
[08:21.820 --> 08:22.420]  Alvin Davis.
[08:22.500 --> 08:25.520]  If Sparky Anderson is still alive, I'm going to make it our goal to get him on the show.
[08:25.860 --> 08:26.560]  Rick Sutcliffe.
[08:26.940 --> 08:27.860]  Dave Magidon.
[08:27.920 --> 08:28.940]  Ooh, he's not going on the show.
[08:28.940 --> 08:32.740]  Hey, Rick Sutcliffe!
[08:32.980 --> 08:33.780]  Was he gone pre-Zim?
[08:34.900 --> 08:37.600]  Tell me Zim outlasted Sparky Anderson.
[08:38.060 --> 08:40.280]  He died in 2010.
[08:40.740 --> 08:42.360]  Oh, Zim was 2014?
[08:42.420 --> 08:45.180]  He was born in 1934.
[08:45.840 --> 08:46.360]  Wow.
[08:47.700 --> 08:49.140]  It was a full life.
[08:49.160 --> 08:49.620]  It was.
[08:49.760 --> 08:50.060]  Sparky had.
[08:50.140 --> 08:51.340]  It did not get much fuller.
[08:51.960 --> 08:54.740]  Sparky Anderson lived in a time when people were still called Sparky.
[08:55.320 --> 08:57.640]  Yeah, it's probably his legal Christian name.
[08:58.540 --> 08:59.900]  All right, what do we got?
[09:00.120 --> 09:00.580]  Scott Bradley.
[09:00.920 --> 09:01.720]  Oral Herscheiser.
[09:02.640 --> 09:03.780]  Everybody loves Oral Herscheiser.
[09:03.920 --> 09:04.800]  Dickie Thawne.
[09:04.900 --> 09:05.940]  Greg Catteret.
[09:06.460 --> 09:07.480]  Dickie Thawne's good name.
[09:08.640 --> 09:09.680]  Bob Garan.
[09:10.100 --> 09:11.080]  Like the other guys.
[09:11.560 --> 09:13.620]  It looks like...
[09:13.620 --> 09:14.260]  Samuel's right there.
[09:15.300 --> 09:16.360]  Samuel got on two cars.
[09:16.980 --> 09:21.740]  It looks kind of like Ricky Garrett is delivering for Samuel.
[09:22.840 --> 09:24.380]  It looks like Samuel's giving birth.
[09:24.380 --> 09:24.860]  It's a boy.
[09:25.260 --> 09:26.140]  Yeah, there you go.
[09:27.200 --> 09:28.000]  Roger McDowell.
[09:28.120 --> 09:29.100]  Darren Dalton.
[09:29.240 --> 09:30.120]  Brooke Jacoby.
[09:30.340 --> 09:31.220]  Doug Rader.
[09:31.900 --> 09:34.940]  Oh, that's a nose of a champion right there.
[09:34.960 --> 09:35.560]  Rob Bob Uker look.
[09:35.880 --> 09:36.420]  Yeah, look at that.
[09:36.740 --> 09:37.140]  Champorino?
[09:37.620 --> 09:38.380]  Scott Champorino.
[09:38.460 --> 09:38.940]  We got to save that.
[09:39.080 --> 09:40.200]  Gary Templeton.
[09:40.480 --> 09:40.840]  Steve Lake.
[09:41.040 --> 09:42.600]  Brad Ornsberg.
[09:43.120 --> 09:43.720]  Baseball name.
[09:43.900 --> 09:45.000]  Yeah, that's definitely a baseball name.
[09:45.420 --> 09:47.420]  That's a Cal Ripken Jr. record breaker card.
[09:47.520 --> 09:48.260]  That's probably worth something.
[09:48.360 --> 09:48.960]  Bob McClure.
[09:49.040 --> 09:49.680]  I doubt it is.
[09:50.100 --> 09:52.620]  Cal Ripken Jr. cards have maintained some value for some reason.
[09:53.100 --> 09:55.280]  I think it's because of the record that no one will ever break.
[09:55.280 --> 09:56.960]  That could be partially it.
[09:58.060 --> 09:59.140]  No Zims yet.
[09:59.340 --> 09:59.820]  That's fine.
[09:59.940 --> 10:01.160]  We got to bounce around.
[10:01.580 --> 10:02.300]  That's okay, though.
[10:02.380 --> 10:03.120]  We got a lot left to do.
[10:03.220 --> 10:07.480]  Gavin, I wanted to bring back something that was a lot of fun last time we did.
[10:07.860 --> 10:10.360]  You know, we got some of these James Bond archives.
[10:10.480 --> 10:12.160]  You've got two autographs already.
[10:12.300 --> 10:12.620]  That's true.
[10:13.420 --> 10:14.800]  I think we were all pretty impressed.
[10:14.920 --> 10:16.660]  We got a lot of cool cue cards.
[10:17.220 --> 10:22.390]  But we also had one billion Magikarp Pog packs.
[10:23.080 --> 10:24.240]  We had a little dench pile.
[10:24.240 --> 10:25.180]  Yeah, we had a dench pile.
[10:25.260 --> 10:30.720]  Why don't you open that up, and we'll see a little reminisce on what most of the last episode was.
[10:30.800 --> 10:31.720]  What have you planted in this?
[10:31.840 --> 10:31.960]  Nothing.
[10:33.160 --> 10:34.300]  They're in the hundredth minute.
[10:36.740 --> 10:37.840]  Is it still 1-1?
[10:38.240 --> 10:38.980]  It's still 1-1.
[10:39.300 --> 10:40.960]  That's as exciting as an Austin FC game.
[10:43.220 --> 10:44.800]  We got some piercings.
[10:44.880 --> 10:46.620]  Oh, you got a gold pierce. Look at that.
[10:46.840 --> 10:47.800]  It's upside down.
[10:47.880 --> 10:48.520]  It looks terrible.
[10:48.940 --> 10:49.980]  I don't even know what that one is.
[10:50.280 --> 10:51.300]  These look terrible.
[10:51.360 --> 10:52.120]  They're so bad.
[10:52.140 --> 10:53.200]  These Pogs suck.
[10:53.200 --> 10:55.820]  No offense to anybody associated with this.
[10:55.840 --> 10:57.160]  Honestly, full offense to whoever made these.
[10:57.380 --> 10:58.440]  Look at these.
[10:58.800 --> 10:59.900]  Andrew, full offense.
[11:00.220 --> 11:11.640]  And if you aren't familiar with the rich backstory of the James Bond Pogs, we have these because I accidentally spent $50 on them.
[11:11.700 --> 11:13.340]  I thought I was buying cards.
[11:13.500 --> 11:16.440]  You split them across the episodes to make them worth it.
[11:16.460 --> 11:17.920]  Are you opening actual cards now?
[11:17.920 --> 11:19.220]  I'm going to open a James Bond pack.
[11:19.300 --> 11:19.780]  I like it.
[11:20.200 --> 11:21.600]  Hopefully we'll get lucky there for you.
[11:22.500 --> 11:24.600]  Andrew, do you think we're getting lucky here?
[11:24.980 --> 11:27.120]  I mean, that was a Denchless pack.
[11:27.300 --> 11:29.920]  No Zim, no Dench.
[11:30.320 --> 11:32.280]  We're going for Dench.
[11:33.680 --> 11:35.460]  Oh, Dench.
[11:36.120 --> 11:38.960]  Oh, that's cool.
[11:39.400 --> 11:40.360]  It's a UAP.
[11:41.300 --> 11:43.320]  Is that from Spider Love Me? I don't remember.
[11:44.760 --> 11:48.060]  I saw a Southwest Airlines pilot talking about this on CNN.
[11:48.280 --> 11:49.760]  That was unexplained. That's an alien.
[11:49.760 --> 11:51.340]  You saw a Southwest what?
[11:51.580 --> 11:52.260]  Just making stuff up.
[11:54.660 --> 11:55.440]  It's a UAP.
[11:55.980 --> 11:57.820]  All right, so we got one Dench. That's not bad.
[11:57.960 --> 11:59.380]  A little bit of Dench. Not a solo Dench.
[11:59.660 --> 12:02.060]  I want to go into uncharted, newer territory.
[12:02.220 --> 12:04.880]  Let's pop open. I want to see what's up with these.
[12:05.060 --> 12:05.840]  How are you doing today, Andrew?
[12:06.560 --> 12:06.940]  Good.
[12:07.120 --> 12:08.580]  It's weird, he looked at me when he said that.
[12:08.940 --> 12:11.780]  That was strange. He kind of looked to the right.
[12:12.760 --> 12:19.360]  So, I informed Andrew yesterday that Will Smith and Randy Quaid actually have a scene together.
[12:20.100 --> 12:21.080]  In Independence Day.
[12:21.160 --> 12:21.620]  Do they really?
[12:21.920 --> 12:22.800]  He was worried that they'd never met.
[12:23.220 --> 12:25.900]  Well, we proved that they'd met on a carpet somewhere, right?
[12:26.420 --> 12:29.600]  He picks Will Smith up from the desert and takes him to Area 51.
[12:29.700 --> 12:34.120]  Don't forget, when we pull a new pack, one pack goes into the sack pack.
[12:34.300 --> 12:34.740]  The pack sack.
[12:35.220 --> 12:35.980]  That's not what it says.
[12:36.760 --> 12:37.460]  It's a sack pack.
[12:37.940 --> 12:41.540]  We're not going to spend much time with the pack sack today because we're short on time.
[12:41.680 --> 12:43.160]  But yes, you feed the pack sack.
[12:43.340 --> 12:45.480]  I'm excited to get onto Twin Peaks in a sec.
[12:45.500 --> 12:46.480]  I'm excited to get onto Twin Peaks.
[12:46.480 --> 12:49.680]  I'm excited to get onto the basketball that's been sitting staring at me for a month.
[12:49.800 --> 12:51.020]  I'm really hoping for Leland.
[12:52.160 --> 12:57.800]  Geoff said that he's had these 12 packs that he's been itching to open and then was almost tempted into doing it last night.
[12:57.900 --> 13:02.060]  And it's like, why would anyone tempt you into that?
[13:02.580 --> 13:03.780]  Because my girlfriend's evil.
[13:03.900 --> 13:04.540]  Yeah, exactly.
[13:04.780 --> 13:08.180]  They were on the kitchen counter last night and I was like, I've been looking at these for a month.
[13:09.020 --> 13:10.400]  I'm so excited to open them tomorrow.
[13:10.480 --> 13:11.560]  And she goes, why don't you open one now?
[13:13.340 --> 13:15.760]  Why would I open one? A, there's no such thing as opening one.
[13:15.920 --> 13:16.960]  And B, how dare you?
[13:17.120 --> 13:18.920]  Could you imagine if you just opened one?
[13:19.220 --> 13:22.300]  Yes. No, I've never done one of anything in my life.
[13:23.680 --> 13:25.900]  That's why we're in the situation we're in now.
[13:27.280 --> 13:28.840]  We got number five.
[13:28.980 --> 13:30.220]  This is the first time I've ever seen these.
[13:30.460 --> 13:31.220]  Umbrella Academy.
[13:31.360 --> 13:31.620]  That's true.
[13:31.740 --> 13:32.400]  I'm pretty happy.
[13:33.540 --> 13:33.900]  Okay.
[13:34.180 --> 13:35.360]  And then we have...
[13:35.360 --> 13:36.560]  Oh, there's their dad.
[13:37.240 --> 13:38.700]  Turn your card sideways.
[13:38.780 --> 13:39.480]  Do you want to see them like this?
[13:39.920 --> 13:40.860]  So we can see them?
[13:40.860 --> 13:41.160]  Yeah.
[13:41.660 --> 13:44.320]  I feel like I look so weird displayed.
[13:44.820 --> 13:46.900]  It's a bunch of sideways dents before.
[13:47.020 --> 13:49.660]  We only see each other at weddings and funerals.
[13:50.440 --> 13:51.380]  What is this?
[13:51.480 --> 13:52.100]  Is this a show?
[13:52.120 --> 13:53.260]  Have you not seen the Umbrella Academy?
[13:53.380 --> 13:53.660]  No.
[13:54.200 --> 13:54.740]  What is it?
[13:54.800 --> 13:57.820]  It is a TV show on Netflix.
[13:58.180 --> 13:58.800]  It's huge.
[13:58.920 --> 13:59.480]  Two seasons.
[13:59.680 --> 14:00.160]  Is it new?
[14:00.440 --> 14:01.820]  Everything on Netflix has two seasons.
[14:01.820 --> 14:03.120]  It's got Elliot Page in it.
[14:03.440 --> 14:04.840]  They would be the biggest star in it.
[14:05.760 --> 14:06.380]  Jesus Christ.
[14:06.960 --> 14:10.120]  I was written by the brother of the guy from some band.
[14:10.820 --> 14:12.420]  Was that the My Chemical Romance show?
[14:12.620 --> 14:12.640]  Yeah.
[14:12.800 --> 14:13.700]  My Chemical Romance.
[14:13.920 --> 14:15.060]  There's another number five.
[14:15.160 --> 14:15.740]  The white violin.
[14:16.000 --> 14:16.900]  This must be from season one.
[14:17.300 --> 14:17.700]  Extraordinary.
[14:18.260 --> 14:19.500]  This must be from season one.
[14:19.500 --> 14:21.620]  That's when Ellen was still...
[14:21.620 --> 14:22.300]  Ellen Page, I think.
[14:22.380 --> 14:23.060]  It's not Elliot yet.
[14:23.240 --> 14:24.200]  If that was season one.
[14:24.680 --> 14:26.460]  And then the white violin again.
[14:26.940 --> 14:27.180]  What the fuck?
[14:27.340 --> 14:28.700]  Why does that guy look like that?
[14:28.820 --> 14:29.800]  He's the older brother.
[14:31.140 --> 14:32.800]  Do you want to know why he looks like that?
[14:33.700 --> 14:34.020]  Yeah.
[14:34.240 --> 14:34.640]  Give me that.
[14:34.840 --> 14:35.600]  He's half gorilla.
[14:36.160 --> 14:36.900]  I'm sorry.
[14:37.480 --> 14:37.700]  Yeah.
[14:37.760 --> 14:38.900]  Let me find a...
[14:38.900 --> 14:40.200]  He's half gorilla?
[14:40.420 --> 14:40.500]  Yeah.
[14:40.540 --> 14:41.780]  He's like fused with a monkey.
[14:42.100 --> 14:42.520]  Or a gorilla.
[14:42.820 --> 14:44.100]  So he's got like gorilla arms.
[14:44.160 --> 14:44.460]  What?
[14:44.660 --> 14:45.100]  Look at...
[14:45.100 --> 14:46.140]  Gavin, look at this.
[14:46.480 --> 14:47.000]  He didn't...
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.980]  You don't see him a lot in season one because he spent all...
[14:48.980 --> 14:50.120]  He was on the moon the whole time.
[14:50.300 --> 14:51.660]  What are you saying?
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.700]  Yeah, he spent season one on the moon.
[14:53.960 --> 14:55.060]  Andrew, is this all real?
[14:55.860 --> 14:56.660]  I have no idea.
[14:57.140 --> 14:58.420]  I'm waiting for an umbrella.
[14:58.680 --> 14:59.560]  Is there an umbrella card?
[14:59.600 --> 15:01.520]  How many umbrellas are in the Umbrella Academy?
[15:02.720 --> 15:04.340]  There's one for every kid, I think.
[15:05.160 --> 15:05.960]  There's five...
[15:05.960 --> 15:06.460]  Seven kids?
[15:06.520 --> 15:06.840]  I don't know.
[15:07.760 --> 15:09.080]  There's Elliot Page again.
[15:09.260 --> 15:09.840]  Here is...
[15:10.500 --> 15:11.340]  Oh, this is from season two.
[15:11.760 --> 15:13.520]  This is from when this character...
[15:13.520 --> 15:14.100]  I don't remember her name.
[15:14.360 --> 15:18.360]  But they go back in time and they're in Dallas when Kennedy's assassinated.
[15:18.520 --> 15:18.740]  What?
[15:19.080 --> 15:20.100]  What is this?
[15:20.420 --> 15:21.240]  It's the Umbrella Academy.
[15:21.340 --> 15:21.720]  It's a show.
[15:22.020 --> 15:23.960]  This is insane.
[15:24.140 --> 15:24.940]  John Risen knows.
[15:25.140 --> 15:25.760]  It's good as hell, right?
[15:25.800 --> 15:27.200]  He doesn't understand what the show is.
[15:27.380 --> 15:28.700]  He's like, why is there a half gorilla?
[15:29.080 --> 15:30.360]  There's a half gorilla.
[15:30.860 --> 15:31.540]  Oh, he's on the moon.
[15:31.760 --> 15:32.400]  Oh, these are...
[15:32.400 --> 15:33.720]  Did they try and save JFK?
[15:34.920 --> 15:36.560]  Some of them tried to save JFK.
[15:36.560 --> 15:37.520]  Some of them tried to kill him.
[15:37.520 --> 15:38.620]  If I remember correctly.
[15:38.760 --> 15:39.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:39.760 --> 15:40.800]  What a weird academy.
[15:41.180 --> 15:41.700]  They were divided.
[15:42.560 --> 15:43.500]  Pass this test.
[15:43.840 --> 15:46.960]  It's gonna get weirder in season three, let me tell you.
[15:47.780 --> 15:48.080]  Uh...
[15:48.080 --> 15:50.640]  I think this is when number five tries to kill number five.
[15:51.100 --> 15:52.560]  Uh, the day that was...
[15:53.260 --> 15:54.140]  This rules.
[15:54.560 --> 15:55.240]  Is that the gorilla?
[15:55.540 --> 15:56.500]  That's the...
[15:56.500 --> 15:56.760]  Oh.
[15:57.160 --> 15:57.960]  Look at him.
[15:58.100 --> 15:59.100]  What else was he in?
[15:59.600 --> 16:00.500]  Look at him.
[16:00.660 --> 16:01.880]  He was...
[16:01.880 --> 16:03.800]  He pops up all the time.
[16:03.860 --> 16:04.500]  He's a big guy.
[16:04.620 --> 16:05.680]  Why is head ain't a gorilla?
[16:05.680 --> 16:06.280]  What?
[16:06.920 --> 16:09.840]  That would have been way better if it was a man with a monkey head.
[16:09.840 --> 16:10.460]  Oh, he was in Game of Thrones.
[16:10.560 --> 16:11.620]  I like that way better.
[16:11.700 --> 16:12.500]  Who was he in Game of Thrones?
[16:12.580 --> 16:13.980]  He was the...
[16:13.980 --> 16:14.900]  I believe...
[16:14.900 --> 16:15.660]  He was the half gorilla.
[16:15.920 --> 16:19.080]  ...the son that died with his dad by the dragon when the...
[16:19.080 --> 16:19.560]  Oh!
[16:20.460 --> 16:21.260]  ...refused to...
[16:21.260 --> 16:21.560]  Yeah.
[16:21.840 --> 16:22.280]  I think...
[16:22.280 --> 16:23.080]  I believe that was his...
[16:23.080 --> 16:23.280]  Good.
[16:23.580 --> 16:24.760]  These are all sideways cards.
[16:25.260 --> 16:25.600]  Alright.
[16:25.940 --> 16:26.940]  I was really hoping to get an...
[16:26.940 --> 16:27.660]  Like a relic.
[16:27.720 --> 16:28.340]  Oh, there they are.
[16:28.620 --> 16:29.380]  They're in love.
[16:29.880 --> 16:30.260]  But they're not.
[16:30.820 --> 16:32.440]  They're brother and sister, but it's not.
[16:32.940 --> 16:33.580]  It's not.
[16:33.580 --> 16:34.780]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16:34.780 --> 16:35.320]  It's not blood.
[16:35.660 --> 16:36.580]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[16:36.740 --> 16:37.180]  They're all adopted.
[16:37.360 --> 16:38.000]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[16:38.200 --> 16:39.320]  You're really glossing over that.
[16:39.580 --> 16:40.300]  They're in love.
[16:40.660 --> 16:41.560]  They're brother and sister.
[16:42.160 --> 16:44.340]  Well, yeah, because they're adopted, right?
[16:44.620 --> 16:45.780]  It was an adoption thing.
[16:46.020 --> 16:46.160]  Oh!
[16:46.560 --> 16:46.680]  Right.
[16:46.720 --> 16:48.140]  But she's married to another dude.
[16:48.360 --> 16:50.640]  She's married to a civil rights activist, and he is not cool with it.
[16:50.640 --> 16:52.960]  Is he half of anything, or...
[16:52.960 --> 16:53.540]  I think he's...
[16:53.540 --> 16:54.760]  He's just a normal dude.
[16:54.900 --> 16:55.040]  Oh.
[16:55.080 --> 16:55.420]  Good guy.
[16:55.580 --> 16:55.900]  Good guy.
[16:56.080 --> 16:56.280]  Okay.
[16:56.320 --> 16:56.920]  Liked him a lot.
[16:57.100 --> 16:57.220]  Okay.
[16:57.260 --> 16:59.680]  One, I don't remember what that particular scene is.
[17:00.080 --> 17:01.000]  Ch-ch-changes.
[17:01.000 --> 17:01.320]  I don't remember what that scene is.
[17:01.420 --> 17:02.100]  I don't remember that.
[17:02.800 --> 17:03.340]  And, uh...
[17:03.340 --> 17:04.260]  Oh, there's...
[17:04.260 --> 17:05.280]  That's, uh...
[17:05.280 --> 17:06.420]  That's Mary J. Blige, I believe.
[17:07.120 --> 17:07.560]  What the...
[17:07.560 --> 17:08.080]  Yeah, she's one of the agents.
[17:08.460 --> 17:08.860]  She plays...
[17:08.860 --> 17:09.960]  She's a character in it.
[17:09.980 --> 17:10.120]  Oh.
[17:10.600 --> 17:12.120]  That would be from season one, I believe.
[17:12.260 --> 17:15.040]  I'm just gonna watch episode, like, six of this show.
[17:15.620 --> 17:18.180]  The first season, episode six.
[17:18.500 --> 17:19.760]  You go, so this guy's the gorilla.
[17:19.940 --> 17:20.340]  All right.
[17:20.600 --> 17:20.940]  I like it.
[17:20.940 --> 17:21.380]  How, uh...
[17:21.380 --> 17:21.720]  Should we watch it together?
[17:21.720 --> 17:22.260]  That lives on the moon.
[17:22.320 --> 17:22.860]  Yeah, absolutely.
[17:23.320 --> 17:24.360]  It's a fantastic show.
[17:24.360 --> 17:25.140]  We'll get D-Box going.
[17:25.280 --> 17:25.780]  It'll be crazy.
[17:25.920 --> 17:26.840]  They'll shoot smoke at the screen.
[17:27.340 --> 17:29.920]  We should save up together and buy one D-Box seat.
[17:32.460 --> 17:35.460]  Uh, okay, we got more.
[17:35.700 --> 17:37.060]  Sir, these come in rows of four.
[17:37.220 --> 17:38.040]  I said one.
[17:38.880 --> 17:42.280]  Anytime Elliot Page plays the violin, it's bad news for everybody else.
[17:42.280 --> 17:42.940]  Uh-oh.
[17:43.680 --> 17:44.620]  We already have that one.
[17:44.740 --> 17:45.020]  It's a double.
[17:45.120 --> 17:46.020]  Number five, it's a double.
[17:46.460 --> 17:46.980]  That's a double.
[17:47.160 --> 17:47.720]  We already have that one.
[17:47.800 --> 17:48.080]  Violin!
[17:49.000 --> 17:49.580]  It's an umbrella card.
[17:49.720 --> 17:50.540]  There was an umbrella card.
[17:50.640 --> 17:51.420]  That's a double also.
[17:51.520 --> 17:52.000]  There's an umbrella in the card.
[17:52.480 --> 17:53.660]  Yeah, there was an umbrella in the card.
[17:53.700 --> 17:54.660]  There's an umbrella in every card, buddy.
[17:54.700 --> 17:55.380]  It's right there.
[17:57.620 --> 17:58.860]  That's not a fun umbrella.
[17:59.100 --> 17:59.820]  What is it, Gavin?
[17:59.960 --> 18:00.140]  What happened?
[18:00.180 --> 18:00.800]  Is it coming home?
[18:01.880 --> 18:02.360]  Are we coming home?
[18:02.600 --> 18:02.920]  No.
[18:02.920 --> 18:04.500]  I think it's like half time of extra time.
[18:04.620 --> 18:06.480]  Yeah, they're in the hundred and fifth minute plus two.
[18:06.520 --> 18:07.280]  We're gonna open one more.
[18:07.340 --> 18:08.360]  How are we doing on time, Eric?
[18:08.740 --> 18:10.540]  We're at, uh, hey, you know what time it is?
[18:10.820 --> 18:11.400]  It's 419.
[18:12.260 --> 18:16.720]  Okay, we only see each other at weddings and funerals.
[18:16.780 --> 18:17.820]  I feel like we've heard that before.
[18:17.820 --> 18:18.120]  We have.
[18:18.240 --> 18:19.540]  I think that's maybe the name of an episode.
[18:20.220 --> 18:22.200]  But that's a, maybe that's a wedding and a funeral.
[18:22.440 --> 18:23.360]  Like four weddings and a funeral.
[18:23.500 --> 18:24.340]  I don't remember that scene, though.
[18:26.840 --> 18:27.800]  Is that, she's holding an umbrella?
[18:28.180 --> 18:28.920]  So this is sad.
[18:28.920 --> 18:29.460]  It looks like an umbrella?
[18:29.580 --> 18:30.680]  It looks like that might be an umbrella.
[18:30.720 --> 18:31.160]  This is sad.
[18:31.260 --> 18:32.520]  Her partner, that's his girlfriend.
[18:32.800 --> 18:35.380]  They fell in love and there's a whole, I don't want to spoil it.
[18:35.520 --> 18:35.620]  Okay.
[18:36.040 --> 18:36.860]  Yeah, that was close.
[18:36.880 --> 18:38.420]  Oh, that's the one brother.
[18:38.580 --> 18:38.960]  Did he drop pizza on his shorts?
[18:38.960 --> 18:40.200]  He can see the dead brother.
[18:41.040 --> 18:42.400]  He eats all over him.
[18:42.520 --> 18:42.820]  There's that dude.
[18:42.840 --> 18:44.260]  He was eating a big old plate of spaghetti.
[18:44.460 --> 18:45.360]  Oh, look, there they are.
[18:45.720 --> 18:46.200]  They're brothers.
[18:46.500 --> 18:47.080]  Tiny heads.
[18:47.080 --> 18:47.840]  He's a little guy.
[18:47.940 --> 18:48.560]  He's a big guy.
[18:48.900 --> 18:53.820]  Why would you, for like an adaptation to do that is hilarious.
[18:55.800 --> 18:57.240]  Yeah, make him big.
[18:57.340 --> 18:58.620]  I thought you said one more.
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.540]  But I want to get like a, I want to do one more, one more.
[19:04.800 --> 19:06.860]  We only see each other at weddings and funerals.
[19:06.920 --> 19:07.300]  Oh boy.
[19:07.460 --> 19:08.700]  That must be the name of the episode.
[19:08.960 --> 19:09.580]  I think, yeah.
[19:09.840 --> 19:10.820]  The Day That Wasn't.
[19:10.960 --> 19:12.200]  The Day That Was.
[19:13.760 --> 19:14.080]  Extraordinary.
[19:14.320 --> 19:16.000]  That's the dude who, it was his girlfriend.
[19:16.140 --> 19:17.080]  That's Mary J. Blige's partner.
[19:18.600 --> 19:19.240]  And then...
[19:19.240 --> 19:20.240]  Another Day That Wasn't.
[19:20.380 --> 19:21.980]  Look at the lights in that ceiling.
[19:22.500 --> 19:23.160]  That's cool, isn't it?
[19:23.200 --> 19:23.800]  They have some cool set designs.
[19:23.800 --> 19:25.100]  Yeah, that's really lovely.
[19:25.560 --> 19:26.660]  I wonder where you could buy that.
[19:26.940 --> 19:27.600]  Buy that ceiling?
[19:28.000 --> 19:28.460]  Yeah, why not?
[19:28.520 --> 19:29.960]  Oh, there's another picture of him.
[19:31.200 --> 19:33.160]  He, he actually...
[19:33.160 --> 19:33.720]  There he is.
[19:34.340 --> 19:35.860]  Oh my god!
[19:36.400 --> 19:38.020]  That's pretty cool looking, actually.
[19:38.400 --> 19:39.340]  That's a cool suit.
[19:39.680 --> 19:44.300]  I like, I feel like this guy, where I'm going, what the fuck?
[19:45.500 --> 19:46.660]  That's his brother, dude.
[19:46.720 --> 19:47.440]  What? Stop!
[19:49.480 --> 19:51.160]  Oh my god, are we getting in between beats?
[19:51.160 --> 19:52.960]  Why are you allowed to show that, but I'm not allowed to show the footage?
[19:52.960 --> 19:56.000]  It's, um, it's not moving, and also this doesn't live anywhere. Don't worry about it.
[19:57.620 --> 19:58.760]  Alright, Gavin, this is exciting.
[19:59.260 --> 19:59.800]  Oh, here we go.
[19:59.880 --> 20:01.840]  We're cracking in. I didn't even know these existed.
[20:02.680 --> 20:04.920]  I hope we get, I hope we get both the Peaks.
[20:05.080 --> 20:09.580]  I hope we get Kyle McClough, and, and the guy that plays Leland.
[20:10.200 --> 20:10.820]  One in the pack sack.
[20:10.940 --> 20:12.360]  Are there any chase cards in this?
[20:12.580 --> 20:14.080]  Uh, not that I'm aware of.
[20:14.320 --> 20:14.460]  What?
[20:14.600 --> 20:19.460]  My last chase card was the, uh, Chris Kamen White Walker card from NBA Prism, and we did not get it.
[20:19.460 --> 20:19.700]  No.
[20:19.740 --> 20:20.980]  And I spent $400 not to get it.
[20:20.980 --> 20:21.200]  Yeah.
[20:21.200 --> 20:23.440]  Are we gonna get, uh, any autographs in these?
[20:23.720 --> 20:24.040]  We might.
[20:24.220 --> 20:24.400]  Oh!
[20:25.120 --> 20:26.400]  You might get an autographed Lynch.
[20:26.640 --> 20:27.140]  Oh, wow.
[20:27.560 --> 20:28.180]  What happened?
[20:28.460 --> 20:28.820]  Come on.
[20:29.020 --> 20:30.140]  I was rookie move.
[20:30.360 --> 20:31.000]  Nah, no kidding.
[20:31.340 --> 20:31.840]  Oh my god.
[20:32.140 --> 20:33.020]  Alright, let's see what these look like.
[20:33.100 --> 20:34.260]  Oh, there's Billy Zane.
[20:34.420 --> 20:34.800]  Wow.
[20:35.180 --> 20:35.960]  And, uh...
[20:35.960 --> 20:36.280]  Wow!
[20:36.800 --> 20:38.620]  Jerry Horn's brother, the other Horn.
[20:38.720 --> 20:39.120]  Ben Horn.
[20:39.120 --> 20:40.440]  Ben Horn, that's Audrey's dad.
[20:41.000 --> 20:45.860]  There we have, uh, Pete Martell and Catherine... what is her name?
[20:47.000 --> 20:47.400]  Catherine...
[20:47.400 --> 20:49.120]  You just gotta tilt him a little bit so the camera can see.
[20:49.420 --> 20:49.720]  Catherine something.
[20:49.720 --> 20:50.560]  I was looking at Gavin.
[20:50.800 --> 20:51.100]  There you go.
[20:51.260 --> 20:53.520]  So yeah, Pete Martell, he's the best character in Twin Peaks.
[20:53.700 --> 20:59.880]  He starts the show off and he goes, uh, Sheriff Truman, dead, wrapped in plastic.
[21:01.420 --> 21:03.560]  He also has a slight issue with his percolator.
[21:03.640 --> 21:05.720]  Yeah, there's a fish in my percolator.
[21:06.320 --> 21:07.220]  Oh, that's that guy.
[21:07.420 --> 21:07.560]  Yeah.
[21:07.680 --> 21:07.860]  Alright.
[21:07.960 --> 21:09.960]  And there's Ben Horn and Josie.
[21:10.360 --> 21:13.460]  If you haven't seen Twin Peaks yet, she ends up in a doorknob.
[21:14.780 --> 21:15.880]  He's not even lying.
[21:16.220 --> 21:17.100]  She becomes a doorknob.
[21:17.600 --> 21:19.480]  She becomes like a cabinet knob or something.
[21:19.480 --> 21:21.280]  Yeah, she's a cabinet knob.
[21:21.600 --> 21:23.020]  Is anyone half gorilla?
[21:23.640 --> 21:24.620]  Not in Twin Peaks yet.
[21:25.380 --> 21:26.380]  There we have...
[21:26.380 --> 21:26.980]  Are the Peaks on the moon?
[21:27.220 --> 21:28.240]  Yeah, where are the Peaks?
[21:28.440 --> 21:29.320]  That's, uh...
[21:29.320 --> 21:30.480]  What's her name in the show?
[21:30.660 --> 21:31.700]  That's, uh, Edna?
[21:32.280 --> 21:32.520]  Irma?
[21:32.960 --> 21:33.200]  Betty?
[21:33.340 --> 21:33.560]  Betty?
[21:33.840 --> 21:34.520]  No, not Betty.
[21:34.720 --> 21:35.280]  No, it's not Betty.
[21:35.420 --> 21:35.960]  It's Ir...
[21:35.960 --> 21:36.500]  Ir...
[21:36.500 --> 21:37.240]  What's her name?
[21:37.820 --> 21:38.280]  Irma...
[21:38.280 --> 21:39.480]  She runs the...
[21:39.480 --> 21:43.660]  She owns the, uh, little restaurant.
[21:43.820 --> 21:44.000]  Oh!
[21:44.520 --> 21:46.660]  Where they all have cherry pie and coffee.
[21:47.100 --> 21:47.960]  Best Damn Coffee.
[21:47.960 --> 21:48.560]  Best Damn Coffee.
[21:48.940 --> 21:50.420]  And then her husband is Leo.
[21:50.940 --> 21:55.740]  And he's a truck driver and a drug dealer and, uh, probably a wife beater and just kind of a rough dude.
[21:55.980 --> 21:57.840]  And so she falls in love with Bobby.
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.620]  I thought she was married to Hank.
[21:59.760 --> 22:01.920]  Oh, no, you're right. I'm sorry. I was thinking of her assistant.
[22:01.960 --> 22:02.460]  Can you look at that?
[22:03.200 --> 22:03.920]  She's married to Hank.
[22:05.120 --> 22:05.840]  The smallest...
[22:05.840 --> 22:07.560]  She's married to Hank, who's in jail.
[22:08.180 --> 22:10.020]  Who, uh, Bobby, uh...
[22:10.020 --> 22:10.720]  But he comes out.
[22:11.000 --> 22:11.880]  He comes out of jail.
[22:12.020 --> 22:14.900]  And she's having an affair with Ed Hurley, who's married to Nadine.
[22:15.140 --> 22:15.960]  Who's got an eye patch.
[22:15.960 --> 22:18.120]  Nadine does have an eye patch and super strength.
[22:18.200 --> 22:19.080]  Ed runs...
[22:19.080 --> 22:20.100]  She does have super strength.
[22:20.120 --> 22:21.060]  Ed runs, uh...
[22:21.060 --> 22:24.020]  This sounds more mental than the superhero guerrilla show.
[22:24.140 --> 22:26.700]  Ed runs the gas station.
[22:27.580 --> 22:28.040]  424.
[22:28.400 --> 22:28.720]  There you go.
[22:30.160 --> 22:30.620]  160.
[22:30.620 --> 22:31.420]  Oh, this is what we got.
[22:31.680 --> 22:35.300]  Oh, there's Audrey Horn and, uh, Laura Flynn Boyle.
[22:35.400 --> 22:36.090]  Her character is...
[22:36.640 --> 22:36.980]  What is her name?
[22:37.720 --> 22:38.760]  Good save. Good save.
[22:39.060 --> 22:40.140]  She is, um...
[22:40.140 --> 22:41.940]  Audrey and, uh...
[22:41.940 --> 22:42.380]  What is her name?
[22:43.560 --> 22:44.180]  She was...
[22:44.180 --> 22:45.040]  She didn't do the movie.
[22:45.460 --> 22:46.560]  She got replaced by that other...
[22:46.560 --> 22:47.980]  She was recast in the movie, wasn't she?
[22:48.120 --> 22:48.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[22:49.200 --> 22:50.780]  Laura Flynn Boyle was too big at the time.
[22:51.060 --> 22:52.720]  She went all over season two, didn't she?
[22:52.800 --> 22:53.640]  Yeah, her name is...
[22:53.980 --> 22:55.340]  She's in a love affair with James Hurley.
[22:56.760 --> 22:57.080]  Uh...
[22:57.080 --> 22:58.000]  Don't you hate season two?
[22:58.160 --> 23:00.100]  Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of most of it.
[23:00.180 --> 23:00.640]  Some of it's good.
[23:00.960 --> 23:01.680]  All right, here we go.
[23:02.600 --> 23:04.140]  There's Hank after he got out of jail.
[23:04.220 --> 23:05.600]  Leather jacket, that's how you know he's a bad guy.
[23:06.040 --> 23:08.900]  And then Ben Horn, you can tell he's a businessman because he's smoking a cigar.
[23:09.460 --> 23:10.080]  Classic businessman.
[23:10.140 --> 23:11.080]  There's Laura...
[23:11.080 --> 23:11.980]  No, that's her mom.
[23:12.760 --> 23:13.400]  That's, uh...
[23:13.400 --> 23:14.580]  She's in a wheelchair.
[23:14.580 --> 23:15.880]  Zooey Deschanel's mom.
[23:16.020 --> 23:16.900]  Yeah, Zooey Deschanel's mom.
[23:16.920 --> 23:17.560]  They're the same person?
[23:17.780 --> 23:18.540]  That's what it looks like.
[23:18.620 --> 23:19.660]  It looks like she's hugging herself.
[23:19.780 --> 23:21.600]  That's when number five tries to kill number five.
[23:21.740 --> 23:21.940]  Yeah.
[23:22.400 --> 23:24.160]  And then in real life, that's Zooey Deschanel's mom.
[23:24.280 --> 23:24.740]  That's crazy.
[23:24.880 --> 23:25.320]  That's crazy.
[23:25.440 --> 23:28.220]  And, uh, conversely, the other Deschanel's mom.
[23:28.220 --> 23:28.580]  Thank you.
[23:28.720 --> 23:29.420]  Yeah, no, I got it.
[23:30.100 --> 23:31.320]  Uh, there we have...
[23:31.320 --> 23:34.520]  Oh, this would be from the new movie, because that's Robert Forrester.
[23:35.060 --> 23:36.020]  I, uh...
[23:36.020 --> 23:37.540]  Never finished the new season.
[23:38.120 --> 23:38.780]  Hey, Leland!
[23:38.780 --> 23:39.600]  There's Leland Palmer.
[23:39.920 --> 23:41.300]  That's post-her Leland.
[23:41.600 --> 23:42.640]  Yeah, he, uh...
[23:43.480 --> 23:45.240]  He, at some point, stops dying his hair.
[23:45.480 --> 23:45.720]  Yeah.
[23:46.020 --> 23:47.180]  There's, uh...
[23:47.180 --> 23:48.220]  That's the Major.
[23:48.520 --> 23:48.780]  Uh-huh.
[23:48.880 --> 23:49.680]  That's Bobby's dad.
[23:49.700 --> 23:51.360]  Something weird happens to the Major, doesn't it?
[23:51.480 --> 23:56.120]  He goes to the entrance of the Black Lodge, and he gets, like, teleported,
[23:56.180 --> 23:57.580]  and then he disappears for, like, four days,
[23:57.600 --> 23:59.180]  and then he comes back, and he's different, right?
[23:59.260 --> 24:00.320]  Yeah, something like that.
[24:00.380 --> 24:01.200]  We'll open some more of that.
[24:01.820 --> 24:02.360]  I apologize.
[24:02.400 --> 24:02.880]  It's been 20 years.
[24:02.900 --> 24:05.420]  How do you find something weird happening to a character
[24:05.420 --> 24:07.220]  when one of them turns into a doorknob?
[24:07.300 --> 24:09.320]  Like, at what point, what then becomes weird?
[24:09.540 --> 24:11.300]  I think something also weird happens to him.
[24:11.300 --> 24:12.440]  Oh, this is a great one.
[24:12.660 --> 24:15.000]  Here we have the two greatest characters in the show.
[24:15.300 --> 24:17.740]  We've got Kyle McLaughlin there.
[24:17.940 --> 24:18.000]  Okay.
[24:19.020 --> 24:20.180]  He's, uh...
[24:20.180 --> 24:21.460]  Cut to the card.
[24:21.780 --> 24:22.140]  And action.
[24:22.140 --> 24:22.580]  And action.
[24:22.620 --> 24:23.220]  And there we go.
[24:23.320 --> 24:24.200]  There's Dale Cooper.
[24:24.560 --> 24:25.180]  Oh, there we go.
[24:25.580 --> 24:27.020]  On the left is David Lynch.
[24:27.080 --> 24:28.300]  He plays Agent...
[24:28.820 --> 24:29.620]  Well, Rad Dudes.
[24:30.340 --> 24:30.720]  Yeah?
[24:31.040 --> 24:32.540]  That's a Rad Dudes card right there.
[24:32.560 --> 24:33.120]  Oh, Gordon Cole.
[24:33.360 --> 24:34.340]  Agent Gordon Cole.
[24:34.600 --> 24:34.780]  Yeah.
[24:35.080 --> 24:36.920]  He can't hear, so he's got, uh...
[24:36.920 --> 24:38.880]  You can see he's got a hearing aid in,
[24:38.960 --> 24:40.400]  and so everybody has to yell to him.
[24:40.400 --> 24:40.820]  That's funny.
[24:40.960 --> 24:41.720]  He can't hear. It's hilarious.
[24:42.420 --> 24:43.560]  There's Bobby and his mom.
[24:43.660 --> 24:45.140]  He's like, where's... where's Dad?
[24:45.280 --> 24:45.960]  Where's the Major?
[24:46.460 --> 24:47.860]  And the Major's living in space somewhere.
[24:48.320 --> 24:48.760]  Oh!
[24:49.520 --> 24:49.820]  Otto!
[24:51.300 --> 24:51.480]  Otto!
[24:51.480 --> 24:51.980]  Who's that?
[24:52.040 --> 24:52.980]  I don't know who that is.
[24:53.080 --> 24:54.060]  I don't know who the fuck he is.
[24:54.120 --> 24:55.120]  That's not a main character.
[24:55.580 --> 24:57.180]  Christopher Zajac Dinnick.
[24:57.280 --> 24:57.860]  What the fuck?
[24:57.860 --> 24:58.600]  That's Jamie Kennedy.
[24:58.900 --> 24:59.260]  That's...
[24:59.260 --> 25:02.180]  I thought the same thing, Andrew.
[25:02.500 --> 25:02.900]  Ike's...
[25:02.900 --> 25:04.680]  We got Jamie Kennedy's card?
[25:04.760 --> 25:07.840]  Christopher Zajac Dinnick as Ike Spike Stadler in Twin Peaks.
[25:07.880 --> 25:08.800]  I don't remember Ike Spike.
[25:09.080 --> 25:09.580]  Ike Spike?
[25:09.580 --> 25:11.220]  I don't remember Ike Spike either.
[25:11.340 --> 25:12.360]  That must have been in the new season.
[25:12.840 --> 25:13.640]  The Showtime remake.
[25:14.680 --> 25:15.780]  Oh, we'll go ahead and sleeve that in.
[25:15.780 --> 25:17.520]  Ike the Spike Stadler.
[25:18.080 --> 25:18.320]  Alright.
[25:18.580 --> 25:19.000]  In Twin Peaks.
[25:19.220 --> 25:19.960]  Oh, there's...
[25:19.960 --> 25:20.700]  Is that an admit or a cast?
[25:21.200 --> 25:22.380]  There is James Hurley.
[25:22.700 --> 25:23.360]  He is the...
[25:23.360 --> 25:24.020]  Oh, you need to look up her name on the back.
[25:24.100 --> 25:26.800]  He is the dumbest person on...
[25:26.800 --> 25:29.280]  He's the dumbest person in any story ever.
[25:30.320 --> 25:31.980]  Oh, yeah, it's Donna Hayward.
[25:32.140 --> 25:32.460]  Oh, Donna.
[25:32.840 --> 25:34.660]  Did you ever see the Super Mario Bros. movie?
[25:34.920 --> 25:35.100]  Yes.
[25:35.100 --> 25:35.660]  With Bob Hoskins?
[25:36.380 --> 25:37.620]  He kind of looks like...
[25:38.120 --> 25:38.920]  The Koopas.
[25:38.920 --> 25:39.820]  He does.
[25:40.860 --> 25:41.740]  He is...
[25:41.740 --> 25:42.440]  Is that face he makes?
[25:42.660 --> 25:43.760]  That's his vaguely...
[25:43.760 --> 25:46.640]  I don't understand what's going on, but I'm upset about it face.
[25:46.700 --> 25:49.360]  He makes that 98% of the time on the show.
[25:49.560 --> 25:49.900]  That's awesome.
[25:50.080 --> 25:51.700]  And the other time, he's riding a motorcycle.
[25:51.880 --> 25:54.100]  Doesn't he start railing housewives along the way?
[25:54.680 --> 25:55.160]  At some point?
[25:56.180 --> 25:56.620]  Yeah.
[25:56.880 --> 25:57.760]  Yeah, he becomes...
[25:57.760 --> 26:02.780]  He ends up moving in to the garage of a housewife who's got in a bad situation
[26:02.780 --> 26:03.860]  and he has an affair with her and stuff.
[26:04.180 --> 26:04.780]  There's Josie.
[26:04.880 --> 26:05.280]  Oh, pretty Donna.
[26:06.240 --> 26:07.260]  That's Jack Nance.
[26:07.260 --> 26:11.040]  He was in every David Lynch production ever until he died.
[26:11.120 --> 26:14.620]  And there's a documentary about him called You Don't Know Jack, which is fantastic.
[26:15.140 --> 26:16.560]  Crazy story about his life.
[26:16.960 --> 26:20.340]  Wife committed suicide in an insane way.
[26:20.480 --> 26:20.960]  Oh, really?
[26:21.140 --> 26:22.360]  On the set of a movie.
[26:23.020 --> 26:23.420]  What?
[26:23.660 --> 26:23.900]  Yeah.
[26:24.120 --> 26:26.420]  One of those National Lampoon's movies.
[26:26.640 --> 26:26.780]  Yeah.
[26:28.140 --> 26:29.500]  Like the straight-to-video ones.
[26:29.500 --> 26:29.780]  Yeah.
[26:30.020 --> 26:33.000]  She called him and they were like on set and he was like...
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.280]  She was like, if you don't come home right now, I'm gonna kill myself.
[26:35.400 --> 26:36.960]  And he's like, I'm on set, I can't come home.
[26:36.960 --> 26:38.580]  And then the power went out and they couldn't get back.
[26:38.720 --> 26:39.920]  And so she did, I think.
[26:40.620 --> 26:40.940]  What?
[26:41.300 --> 26:42.680]  And then he died under suspicious circumstances.
[26:42.780 --> 26:45.840]  He got into a fight at a gas station in L.A.
[26:46.780 --> 26:49.720]  And he apparently fell in a bathroom and hit his head.
[26:49.900 --> 26:52.140]  And then he walked home and died from the wound.
[26:52.180 --> 26:52.660]  Oh, God.
[26:52.700 --> 26:54.740]  Nobody quite knows who he got into a fight with or anything.
[26:55.020 --> 26:55.340]  Wow.
[26:55.540 --> 26:56.500]  Crazy life, Jack Nance.
[26:57.060 --> 26:58.040]  Really talented dude.
[26:59.180 --> 27:00.320]  Do you ever see Eraserhead, Eric?
[27:00.520 --> 27:00.740]  Yeah.
[27:00.860 --> 27:01.340]  He's Eraserhead.
[27:01.440 --> 27:01.920]  He's the main character.
[27:03.420 --> 27:04.800]  Well, he's not like the weird baby.
[27:05.340 --> 27:05.660]  No.
[27:05.660 --> 27:06.400]  He's Henry.
[27:06.480 --> 27:07.320]  The guy with the hair.
[27:07.840 --> 27:08.080]  No.
[27:08.620 --> 27:09.780]  Okay, that's all those.
[27:09.980 --> 27:10.120]  Uh-huh.
[27:10.180 --> 27:13.680]  Let's see if we can get some more sweet, sweet autographs.
[27:13.680 --> 27:16.140]  What was the name of Laura Palmer's cousin?
[27:16.860 --> 27:17.140]  Maddie.
[27:17.360 --> 27:17.680]  Maddie.
[27:17.760 --> 27:18.240]  Maddie Palmer.
[27:18.920 --> 27:20.440]  Who was Laura Palmer with dark hair?
[27:21.900 --> 27:22.500]  Shelly Lee.
[27:22.800 --> 27:23.960]  David Lynch just really liked her.
[27:24.300 --> 27:29.620]  Well, Shelly Lee was, she became Laura Palmer and instantly everybody knew who she was and
[27:29.620 --> 27:30.240]  who the actress was.
[27:30.300 --> 27:32.020]  But she never said a fucking thing in the show.
[27:32.100 --> 27:32.760]  She was dead.
[27:33.360 --> 27:36.620]  And so then they brought her in as her cousin and they just gave her a wig.
[27:36.780 --> 27:38.420]  And she turned out, she wasn't great.
[27:38.880 --> 27:40.820]  And then they made a fucking movie around her.
[27:40.860 --> 27:41.440]  Yeah, then they did.
[27:41.720 --> 27:43.880]  Is this one like a fire walk with me kind of situation?
[27:43.880 --> 27:44.760]  That was fire walk with me.
[27:44.880 --> 27:45.900]  Yeah, it was a really sad movie.
[27:47.160 --> 27:48.620]  Hurting me, hurting me, Laura.
[27:48.820 --> 27:49.520]  It was a really sad scene.
[27:50.740 --> 27:52.260]  That's gotta be at One Eyed Jack's.
[27:52.300 --> 27:58.660]  That's at the Canadian whorehouse just over the river where a lot of the people from the
[27:58.660 --> 27:59.920]  town work, including high school kids.
[27:59.920 --> 28:03.800]  I didn't think that this show would turn into, let's explain some Twin Peaks to you.
[28:04.700 --> 28:05.940]  It's a great show.
[28:06.020 --> 28:06.920]  There's Ed and Nadine.
[28:07.420 --> 28:08.980]  She's got super strength in an eye patch.
[28:09.140 --> 28:10.840]  She's fucking insane.
[28:11.600 --> 28:16.780]  She invents a way to make silent drape runners using cotton balls and grease.
[28:16.780 --> 28:17.640]  They're really quiet.
[28:17.800 --> 28:18.520]  Very quiet.
[28:18.940 --> 28:19.460]  Very impressive.
[28:19.860 --> 28:21.040]  Oh look, there's Heather Graham.
[28:21.040 --> 28:21.280]  Heather Graham.
[28:21.600 --> 28:23.280]  And she's the love interest of Dale Cooper.
[28:23.400 --> 28:24.620]  How old is she here?
[28:25.480 --> 28:26.060]  She's 18.
[28:26.060 --> 28:28.260]  Her name is Lucy...
[28:28.260 --> 28:28.500]  Annie.
[28:28.500 --> 28:29.420]  Annie Blackburn.
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.780]  She was born in 1970?
[28:33.240 --> 28:34.120]  She gets fucking killed.
[28:34.180 --> 28:34.700]  That's sad.
[28:35.080 --> 28:35.760]  She's fucked up.
[28:35.880 --> 28:36.220]  I can't remember.
[28:36.280 --> 28:39.960]  She ends up stuck in the fucking Black Lodge with him.
[28:40.680 --> 28:44.420]  At the end of Twin Peaks, Cooper rams his head into the fucking thing and he's got blood
[28:44.420 --> 28:45.180]  everywhere and he's laughing.
[28:45.780 --> 28:47.240]  See you in 25 years.
[28:47.360 --> 28:47.640]  Yeah.
[28:47.760 --> 28:48.580]  See you in 25 years.
[28:48.860 --> 28:54.740]  And then there is Zooey Deschanel's mom and I believe her father too actually.
[28:54.820 --> 28:55.080]  What is he?
[28:55.140 --> 28:57.340]  Is he the doctor guy?
[28:57.340 --> 28:59.260]  He's the doctor and he's her husband.
[28:59.420 --> 29:01.020]  Oh, that's a foot to the penis.
[29:02.800 --> 29:04.200]  They're in the 113th minute.
[29:04.640 --> 29:05.900]  Did you see that Conor McGregor fight last night?
[29:05.980 --> 29:06.500]  Speaking of feet.
[29:06.620 --> 29:07.260]  Oh God.
[29:07.360 --> 29:08.080]  Did he break his leg?
[29:08.300 --> 29:08.720]  Billy Zane.
[29:08.940 --> 29:10.000]  It was pretty gruesome.
[29:10.480 --> 29:11.180]  How do you break your own leg?
[29:11.180 --> 29:12.800]  It's about Billy Zane, not the mummy.
[29:12.980 --> 29:13.600]  The Rocketeer?
[29:13.780 --> 29:14.300]  Billy Zane.
[29:14.960 --> 29:15.780]  Not in the mummy?
[29:16.560 --> 29:17.040]  Not in the mummy.
[29:17.220 --> 29:18.020]  Are you getting him confused?
[29:18.080 --> 29:18.460]  Thought he was.
[29:19.140 --> 29:19.860]  Donald Vosloo?
[29:20.540 --> 29:21.180]  Yes, I was.
[29:21.460 --> 29:22.660]  Wait, that's not Billy Zane?
[29:22.820 --> 29:23.060]  No.
[29:25.220 --> 29:25.580]  Serious?
[29:25.800 --> 29:26.960]  I thought that was Billy Zane.
[29:26.960 --> 29:28.060]  But did I?
[29:28.640 --> 29:28.960]  No.
[29:29.380 --> 29:29.800]  It's not.
[29:30.060 --> 29:31.220]  Billy Zane was in Titanic.
[29:31.320 --> 29:31.800]  Good fact.
[29:31.880 --> 29:32.480]  No, I know.
[29:32.660 --> 29:33.520]  He was the Rocketeer.
[29:33.640 --> 29:35.740]  Yeah, I also thought that he was in Scorpion King.
[29:35.840 --> 29:37.360]  Sometimes people are in two movies.
[29:37.440 --> 29:39.080]  Oh, I've never seen Scorpion King.
[29:39.160 --> 29:39.700]  Here we go.
[29:39.700 --> 29:40.440]  Oh, it's the Log Lady.
[29:40.540 --> 29:41.780]  The Log Lady.
[29:42.240 --> 29:44.220]  Now that's a cool card.
[29:44.320 --> 29:45.080]  There's the Major.
[29:45.320 --> 29:46.280]  Can't see it, but there you go.
[29:46.400 --> 29:48.080]  The Major and the Log Lady.
[29:48.440 --> 29:51.620]  What was awesome is that she was able to be in the new Twin Peaks.
[29:51.740 --> 29:52.760]  Right before she died, right?
[29:52.820 --> 29:52.980]  Barely.
[29:52.980 --> 29:54.500]  She was very sick and then she died.
[29:54.500 --> 29:54.760]  She was very sick.
[29:54.960 --> 29:55.680]  Margaret Lantern.
[29:55.680 --> 29:56.460]  She was amazing.
[29:57.300 --> 30:01.040]  Margaret Lantern and Garland Briggs were linked by their inexplicable disappearances from Twin Peaks.
[30:01.240 --> 30:06.840]  Recalling a flash of light, they both returned to strange marks of their bodies, yet no idea what happened.
[30:06.920 --> 30:10.340]  When Margaret saw Garland's marks, they both thought it best to see Agent Cooper.
[30:10.620 --> 30:13.200]  They felt they were connected by something, but neither knew what.
[30:13.320 --> 30:13.740]  What was it?
[30:13.900 --> 30:14.920]  It was the Black Lodge, man.
[30:15.420 --> 30:15.780]  Oh.
[30:17.500 --> 30:18.220]  I thought so, too.
[30:18.740 --> 30:19.560]  We'll open up one more.
[30:20.740 --> 30:21.560]  These are fun.
[30:21.920 --> 30:22.940]  Yeah, I like these.
[30:22.980 --> 30:23.400]  This is awesome.
[30:23.820 --> 30:24.940]  Two autographed cards inside.
[30:24.940 --> 30:25.820]  We've got to get to the other one.
[30:25.920 --> 30:26.620]  We'll get to the other one.
[30:26.840 --> 30:27.540]  Maybe we'll get it right.
[30:27.980 --> 30:29.560]  Oh, we've got a special Audrey Horne card.
[30:29.680 --> 30:29.780]  Okay.
[30:30.460 --> 30:31.080]  Alright, what have we got?
[30:31.180 --> 30:38.120]  Dale Cooper enjoying a damn fine cup of coffee and Audrey Horne, she was the other kind of love interest.
[30:38.240 --> 30:39.380]  She was like 18 or 19.
[30:39.440 --> 30:40.360]  She was in Friends.
[30:40.680 --> 30:40.860]  Jerry.
[30:42.380 --> 30:43.660]  Classic Friends character, Jerry.
[30:43.860 --> 30:45.720]  Jerry threw her wooden leg on the fire.
[30:46.160 --> 30:46.540]  That's true.
[30:47.080 --> 30:47.260]  Maybe.
[30:47.440 --> 30:47.620]  I don't know.
[30:47.720 --> 30:48.160]  I don't see that shit.
[30:49.120 --> 30:49.940]  I'll be there for you.
[30:49.940 --> 30:52.280]  He only had eyes for Annie.
[30:52.280 --> 30:55.220]  Oh, there's Jerry Horne and Ben Horne.
[30:55.460 --> 30:56.680]  Jerry Horne, they're brothers.
[30:56.840 --> 30:57.640]  He's the annoying one.
[30:57.800 --> 31:01.940]  He brings home, every time he comes to visit Ben, he brings him a sandwich from their favorite sandwich restaurant.
[31:01.940 --> 31:02.680]  He looks like a puppet.
[31:03.640 --> 31:03.800]  Yeah.
[31:03.960 --> 31:04.900]  He's on his knee.
[31:05.100 --> 31:07.420]  There's a Twin Peaks Audrey Horne.
[31:07.760 --> 31:10.040]  That's played by actress Sherilyn Finn.
[31:10.320 --> 31:12.140]  The guy who's Jerry Horne, was he the guy in the Warriors?
[31:12.860 --> 31:13.040]  Yeah.
[31:13.220 --> 31:13.400]  Okay.
[31:13.560 --> 31:14.320]  Yeah, that is him.
[31:14.380 --> 31:14.940]  I thought he looked familiar.
[31:15.060 --> 31:15.800]  Audrey Horne.
[31:16.100 --> 31:16.960]  Warriors come out to play.
[31:17.240 --> 31:17.360]  Yeah.
[31:17.860 --> 31:20.240]  Oh, and he's in Commando where he says...
[31:21.320 --> 31:23.000]  Remember when I said I'd kill you last?
[31:23.120 --> 31:23.640]  He said, yeah.
[31:23.700 --> 31:24.380]  And he said, I lied.
[31:24.880 --> 31:26.340]  And then he drops him off a cliff.
[31:26.660 --> 31:27.800]  It's so cool.
[31:27.940 --> 31:28.700]  There's Laura Palmer.
[31:29.540 --> 31:32.560]  There's Laura Palmer and old Agent Cooper in the Black Lodge.
[31:32.600 --> 31:37.380]  She's whispering, I believe she's telling him, that gum you like will come in style or some shit like that, right?
[31:37.640 --> 31:38.140]  Something like that.
[31:38.200 --> 31:39.100]  Ooh, backwards, isn't it?
[31:39.120 --> 31:39.800]  Or backwards, yeah.
[31:39.900 --> 31:40.740]  And then there's Hawk.
[31:41.080 --> 31:42.420]  He's the coolest character in Twin Peaks.
[31:42.600 --> 31:43.500]  You could tell by his hair.
[31:43.620 --> 31:45.560]  I would say of everyone, Hawk has aged the best.
[31:45.660 --> 31:46.260]  Yeah, for sure.
[31:46.660 --> 31:47.520]  Congratulations, Hawk.
[31:48.000 --> 31:48.580]  Silver Hawk now.
[31:48.580 --> 31:50.440]  He's a member of the book house boys.
[31:51.340 --> 31:51.700]  Silver Hawk?
[31:51.700 --> 31:52.320]  Is that what they're called, right?
[31:52.360 --> 31:52.920]  The book house boys?
[31:53.220 --> 31:54.940]  I need to watch this show again.
[31:55.160 --> 31:56.260]  I haven't seen it in so many years.
[31:56.400 --> 31:56.980]  We're gonna get this autographed.
[31:57.080 --> 31:57.680]  Man, we're really going.
[31:57.920 --> 31:58.220]  433.
[31:58.740 --> 32:00.320]  I have you a Blu-ray, by the way, still.
[32:00.540 --> 32:00.780]  Okay.
[32:00.920 --> 32:01.320]  If you want it back.
[32:01.900 --> 32:02.180]  Oh!
[32:02.320 --> 32:03.080]  I don't know what I would play it on.
[32:03.080 --> 32:04.680]  While you're opening that...
[32:04.680 --> 32:06.080]  You can go to this one.
[32:07.120 --> 32:07.720]  We got...
[32:07.720 --> 32:10.580]  Oh, there's Hank and Norma.
[32:11.340 --> 32:12.100]  I said Irma and Norma.
[32:12.340 --> 32:13.000]  Hank and Norma.
[32:13.340 --> 32:14.340]  She's pretending to be happy.
[32:14.380 --> 32:15.280]  She fucking hates him.
[32:16.240 --> 32:17.240]  Oh, look, there's...
[32:17.240 --> 32:17.760]  What's his name?
[32:18.960 --> 32:19.320]  Albert.
[32:19.660 --> 32:22.180]  He also barely made the new one.
[32:22.280 --> 32:22.760]  Yeah, Albert.
[32:22.960 --> 32:24.020]  He was in it and then immediately died, yeah.
[32:24.140 --> 32:24.620]  That's a shame.
[32:24.720 --> 32:25.080]  He's awesome.
[32:25.220 --> 32:26.660]  He was also in the beginning of Robocop.
[32:27.240 --> 32:28.040]  He's in a lot of stuff.
[32:28.320 --> 32:30.280]  He plays a dickhead really well.
[32:30.620 --> 32:31.420]  Yeah, he's a great...
[32:31.420 --> 32:33.580]  Oh, there's Leland and...
[32:34.540 --> 32:36.580]  What is Mrs. Palmer's name?
[32:36.740 --> 32:37.140]  I don't remember.
[32:37.220 --> 32:37.960]  But it says it on the back.
[32:38.880 --> 32:39.180]  Sarah.
[32:39.180 --> 32:39.580]  Sarah Palmer.
[32:39.600 --> 32:40.000]  Sarah Palmer.
[32:40.340 --> 32:41.260]  She is...
[32:41.260 --> 32:41.940]  She plays crazy.
[32:42.160 --> 32:44.540]  They both play crazy very well.
[32:45.200 --> 32:46.080]  Do you know who killed Laura Palmer?
[32:47.340 --> 32:48.040]  Arnold Palmer.
[32:48.040 --> 32:49.060]  The drink guy.
[32:49.340 --> 32:50.500]  It wasn't the drink guy.
[32:50.640 --> 32:51.320]  It was the drink.
[32:51.440 --> 32:52.280]  Oh, I knew it.
[32:52.460 --> 32:52.880]  Daniel Electrolytes.
[32:53.020 --> 32:59.120]  There's Hawk and Andy, the dumb deputy with a heart of gold.
[33:00.020 --> 33:00.980]  He was Andy Brennan.
[33:01.020 --> 33:02.120]  His name is Tommy Hawk?
[33:02.360 --> 33:03.120]  That's awesome.
[33:03.320 --> 33:04.160]  Hawk's name is Tommy?
[33:05.880 --> 33:07.160]  Yeah, Tommy Hawk Hill.
[33:07.580 --> 33:07.980]  Damn.
[33:08.320 --> 33:09.320]  I always thought Norma was...
[33:09.320 --> 33:11.060]  Hey, can we show this real quick from Daniel?
[33:11.600 --> 33:12.240]  Norma is pretty...
[33:12.240 --> 33:12.800]  This is Gavin's.
[33:13.400 --> 33:13.700]  Oh, yeah.
[33:13.880 --> 33:14.440]  You can give those out.
[33:15.140 --> 33:15.640]  Oh, thank you.
[33:15.820 --> 33:16.540]  Check this out.
[33:17.080 --> 33:18.100]  Made by Daniel.
[33:18.260 --> 33:19.140]  Six of six.
[33:19.240 --> 33:19.420]  Yep.
[33:19.640 --> 33:20.600]  So these are numbered.
[33:21.140 --> 33:24.480]  They are fuck-faced pencils with a bite taken out and...
[33:24.480 --> 33:25.160]  Take off the cap at the end.
[33:26.180 --> 33:27.060]  Actual pencil.
[33:27.460 --> 33:28.260]  Are you shitting me?
[33:28.400 --> 33:28.820]  Not...
[33:28.820 --> 33:29.620]  Dead serious.
[33:30.840 --> 33:31.700]  Actual pencil.
[33:32.300 --> 33:33.960]  Daniel made these for all of us on the show.
[33:33.960 --> 33:34.960]  I'm gonna sign checks with this.
[33:35.960 --> 33:37.180]  You can't sign checks with a pencil.
[33:37.180 --> 33:38.960]  You can't sign checks with a pencil.
[33:39.080 --> 33:41.000]  The eraser's an eraser too.
[33:41.560 --> 33:42.520]  Daniel made these.
[33:42.640 --> 33:43.900]  Andrew, there's one for you also.
[33:45.080 --> 33:48.620]  When we go to your house in Canada, we'll give you yours if we can find it.
[33:48.720 --> 33:51.040]  Do they just chuck your check if it's got pencil on it?
[33:51.900 --> 33:54.740]  I think they probably send it back and say void and then make you re-sign it.
[33:55.100 --> 33:56.440]  All right, here we go. Back to the cards.
[33:56.460 --> 33:57.040]  I'll give you a late fee.
[33:57.440 --> 33:57.900]  Thank you, Andy.
[33:58.040 --> 33:58.900]  There's Andy and...
[34:00.740 --> 34:01.360]  Bob Odenkirk.
[34:01.620 --> 34:02.340]  What is her name?
[34:02.460 --> 34:02.580]  Oh.
[34:03.560 --> 34:03.880]  Lucy.
[34:04.120 --> 34:04.440]  Lucy.
[34:04.680 --> 34:07.940]  Andy and Lucy, she's the receptionist at the police station and they are in love.
[34:08.240 --> 34:08.840]  And it's...
[34:08.840 --> 34:10.360]  And they are in love.
[34:10.360 --> 34:11.740]  And there's Bob and...
[34:11.740 --> 34:14.320]  Or there's Ed and Bobby.
[34:14.600 --> 34:15.620]  Or not Bobby, James.
[34:16.540 --> 34:17.760]  At the gas station.
[34:17.920 --> 34:19.060]  James is a dumbass motorcycle.
[34:19.940 --> 34:21.560]  There's the Jackson home.
[34:21.700 --> 34:22.580]  Oh, that's...
[34:23.260 --> 34:23.920]  I don't know why.
[34:24.620 --> 34:25.740]  Oh, that's where...
[34:26.180 --> 34:26.740]  That's where...
[34:26.740 --> 34:30.360]  That's where Machinomic and Leo live.
[34:30.420 --> 34:31.320]  Is that where they find Laura Palmer?
[34:32.800 --> 34:34.100]  That's not where they live.
[34:34.200 --> 34:35.000]  But that is a shithole.
[34:35.020 --> 34:36.920]  They live in a real shithole without walls a lot.
[34:37.200 --> 34:37.440]  Yeah.
[34:39.380 --> 34:40.340]  There's a...
[34:40.340 --> 34:41.820]  Before she turned into a doorknob.
[34:44.200 --> 34:48.580]  Oh, there's Ed with his fucking costume on because he wished to look...
[34:48.580 --> 34:51.360]  Pretend to be a high roller to break into the...
[34:51.360 --> 34:52.320]  The show...
[34:52.320 --> 34:56.200]  Do they also include any Firewalk With Me pictures?
[34:56.680 --> 34:57.500]  I haven't seen...
[34:57.500 --> 34:58.200]  We got some Bowie.
[34:58.380 --> 34:59.840]  I haven't seen any Firewalk With Me yet.
[34:59.860 --> 35:00.220]  Oh, that would be good.
[35:00.340 --> 35:01.600]  Oh, or some Kiefer Sutherland.
[35:01.880 --> 35:02.540]  That would be a Kiefer.
[35:03.920 --> 35:08.060]  Hey, don't forget that the fuckface button and the socks are on sale.
[35:08.180 --> 35:09.840]  You can use code FIRST20 and save 20%.
[35:09.840 --> 35:10.360]  Just saying.
[35:10.660 --> 35:11.160]  There's Bowie.
[35:11.720 --> 35:12.980]  After he gets fucked up...
[35:15.400 --> 35:16.180]  Sorry, Leo.
[35:16.400 --> 35:20.940]  After he gets fucked up, he's sort of like comatose, but he only says dumb stuff.
[35:21.360 --> 35:23.700]  Like, no shoes, no shoes, no shoes.
[35:24.280 --> 35:24.920]  You remember, right?
[35:24.940 --> 35:25.940]  Bit of a Hogwarts situation.
[35:28.160 --> 35:32.920]  And they make him wear a dumb birthday hat.
[35:33.000 --> 35:33.640]  Who's he with then?
[35:34.060 --> 35:35.400]  That's the lady who...
[35:35.400 --> 35:38.880]  That's the married lady who he has the tryst with in season two.
[35:38.880 --> 35:40.880]  And wastes all of our time.
[35:41.940 --> 35:43.880]  Oh, this is when Nadine, after she...
[35:44.400 --> 35:45.480]  How does she go crazy?
[35:45.560 --> 35:46.340]  Does she get hit in the head or something?
[35:47.040 --> 35:48.080]  She's already a lunatic.
[35:48.420 --> 35:50.780]  But this is when she thinks she's a high school student.
[35:50.960 --> 35:52.520]  She goes young, yeah.
[35:52.820 --> 35:54.840]  She thinks she's a cheerleader.
[35:55.260 --> 35:57.780]  And that's her hitting on Bowie's best friend.
[35:57.820 --> 35:59.000]  Looks like Chris Favre.
[35:59.460 --> 35:59.900]  Mike.
[36:00.040 --> 36:00.520]  Mike Nelson.
[36:01.040 --> 36:01.800]  He and...
[36:01.800 --> 36:02.340]  Mike Nelson?
[36:02.660 --> 36:06.880]  He and Bowie, they deal drugs in the school through footballs.
[36:07.760 --> 36:09.100]  And they hide them in the woods.
[36:09.260 --> 36:10.280]  Like what, Gavin's watching footballs?
[36:10.340 --> 36:11.400]  You're like, footballs, footballs.
[36:11.400 --> 36:12.760]  No, they're American footballs.
[36:12.920 --> 36:14.620]  Oh, there's...
[36:16.940 --> 36:18.020]  Bowie, they love each other.
[36:18.700 --> 36:19.740]  He's a dickhead, though.
[36:19.800 --> 36:20.020]  Shelley.
[36:20.400 --> 36:20.840]  Bobbie and Shelley.
[36:21.080 --> 36:22.660]  How much stoppage do they get?
[36:23.280 --> 36:23.820]  We'll do one more.
[36:23.980 --> 36:24.340]  Two minutes.
[36:24.900 --> 36:27.080]  They're in the first minute of the two minutes.
[36:27.360 --> 36:28.380]  Where are you getting your info?
[36:28.460 --> 36:28.920]  Where are you getting it from?
[36:29.260 --> 36:29.800]  The internet?
[36:30.480 --> 36:30.840]  Just...
[36:30.840 --> 36:31.140]  Google?
[36:31.860 --> 36:32.400]  Just Googling?
[36:32.680 --> 36:36.040]  Oh, this is when Josie Packard, before she's a doorknob...
[36:37.040 --> 36:40.920]  This dude comes back and he's like, I know about your past and you're in trouble or something.
[36:41.040 --> 36:42.280]  I'm gonna turn you into a doorknob.
[36:42.520 --> 36:46.680]  Yeah, and then there's Leo and... I don't remember who that is.
[36:47.540 --> 36:48.740]  I bet it's on the back of the card.
[36:49.640 --> 36:50.360]  Windham Earl.
[36:50.620 --> 36:51.740]  Oh, it's Windham Earl.
[36:52.320 --> 36:54.620]  Oh, you know who we haven't had? We haven't had...
[36:54.620 --> 36:55.060]  Jacoby.
[36:56.340 --> 36:57.040]  Oh, Jacoby.
[36:57.260 --> 36:59.620]  Windham Earl was an FBI agent who went rogue.
[37:00.040 --> 37:00.340]  Shit.
[37:00.700 --> 37:00.920]  Yeah.
[37:01.220 --> 37:02.080]  Oh, there you go, there's some...
[37:02.080 --> 37:02.420]  That looks like Matt Lucas.
[37:03.040 --> 37:04.040]  I think that is, dude.
[37:05.620 --> 37:06.020]  No.
[37:06.980 --> 37:07.620]  That's from...
[37:07.620 --> 37:07.880]  Chuck.
[37:08.580 --> 37:09.500]  That's from the movie.
[37:09.780 --> 37:11.020]  Or the TV show, the new...
[37:11.020 --> 37:13.120]  He looks like he's about to get hit by a cannon shell.
[37:13.260 --> 37:14.620]  Like, I don't know what his pose is.
[37:14.620 --> 37:15.620]  Like, what is he doing?
[37:15.860 --> 37:17.360]  Ask and you shall receive, Gavin.
[37:17.840 --> 37:18.700]  Oh, Jacoby!
[37:20.240 --> 37:22.680]  He's got his two different colored eyepatch... glasses on.
[37:22.720 --> 37:23.320]  That's cool.
[37:23.400 --> 37:24.460]  Outside painting...
[37:24.460 --> 37:25.080]  For 3D.
[37:25.480 --> 37:27.960]  What was all he did in the new one? He just painted shovels or something?
[37:28.100 --> 37:30.420]  Yeah, he spray painted a bunch of shovels.
[37:30.420 --> 37:31.240]  In a wide shot.
[37:31.500 --> 37:31.620]  Yeah.
[37:32.400 --> 37:34.820]  Alright, are you ready to open your 12 cards? It's 440.
[37:34.940 --> 37:35.580]  Yeah, let's get into it.
[37:35.580 --> 37:36.240]  Where's the autograph?
[37:36.540 --> 37:38.920]  We're gonna go in, we're gonna open BMX cards.
[37:39.420 --> 37:40.740]  What are these? I don't even know.
[37:41.220 --> 37:42.960]  Are these... is this one of your 12 packs that you were excited about?
[37:42.980 --> 37:44.500]  No, no, no. This is BMX freestyle racing.
[37:44.640 --> 37:45.740]  We got any rad dudes this week?
[37:47.300 --> 37:48.440]  Here we go. What do we got?
[37:48.700 --> 37:49.700]  We got, uh... oh.
[37:50.360 --> 37:51.400]  These aren't in great shape.
[37:52.820 --> 37:53.460]  These suck!
[37:53.960 --> 37:55.860]  Twin! We got a twin!
[37:56.560 --> 37:57.880]  These cards suck!
[37:58.040 --> 37:59.160]  Oh, fuck Team Murray!
[38:00.200 --> 38:00.620]  What are you guys doing?
[38:00.700 --> 38:01.300]  Team Murray.
[38:02.080 --> 38:04.180]  This is what I'm gonna be doing in that video that Gavin and I filmed.
[38:04.180 --> 38:05.560]  When are you guys gonna film that?
[38:05.700 --> 38:06.420]  Whenever it stops raining.
[38:06.600 --> 38:07.880]  Oh, look at the action shot.
[38:08.060 --> 38:10.800]  It's gonna be like 8 weeks from when we mention it on the podcast.
[38:10.960 --> 38:12.540]  At least, at least.
[38:12.640 --> 38:15.020]  Alright, let's open up some basketball.
[38:15.520 --> 38:15.780]  Let's do it.
[38:16.020 --> 38:18.340]  These are 2017.
[38:18.620 --> 38:20.620]  Let me tell you a funny story about these soccer cards first.
[38:21.400 --> 38:23.760]  I got excited because Austin got a professional soccer team.
[38:24.180 --> 38:24.420]  Uh-huh.
[38:24.680 --> 38:26.040]  So the Austin FC...
[38:26.040 --> 38:26.940]  Yeah, what year are those cards from?
[38:27.360 --> 38:28.480]  This is the new season.
[38:28.580 --> 38:30.800]  I wanna make sure I got the new season, 21 or whatever.
[38:31.660 --> 38:34.200]  And then I already opened a box at home.
[38:34.300 --> 38:35.800]  Found out that there's no...
[38:36.520 --> 38:36.560]  Yeah.
[38:36.700 --> 38:37.120]  No Austin.
[38:37.380 --> 38:38.740]  Yeah, I would imagine that there's not.
[38:38.860 --> 38:38.960]  Yeah.
[38:39.020 --> 38:41.000]  As it takes time for production.
[38:41.220 --> 38:43.660]  The one card that they have is they have a picture of the stadium.
[38:44.500 --> 38:44.860]  So...
[38:47.020 --> 38:47.820]  Picture of the stadium.
[38:47.900 --> 38:48.740]  So we'll get to that at some point.
[38:48.840 --> 38:50.440]  Those probably came out in March or April.
[38:50.780 --> 38:51.080]  Yeah.
[38:51.240 --> 38:51.400]  Yeah.
[38:51.480 --> 38:51.700]  Probably.
[38:52.260 --> 38:54.420]  Bought these guys online just for this.
[38:54.500 --> 38:57.480]  These are 27 2018 NBA cards.
[38:57.580 --> 38:58.560]  We're gonna be chasing...
[38:58.560 --> 38:59.100]  Who's on the cover?
[38:59.100 --> 38:59.780]  That's Lonzo Ball.
[38:59.780 --> 39:00.060]  Wow.
[39:00.220 --> 39:02.640]  I was gonna say, these are from 2017, 2018.
[39:02.880 --> 39:05.880]  We're gonna be chasing Jason Tatum rookies.
[39:06.320 --> 39:07.280]  Gavin, what's going on, buddy?
[39:07.540 --> 39:08.640]  No penalties, man.
[39:08.700 --> 39:09.420]  Is it coming home?
[39:09.900 --> 39:10.440]  Is it coming home?
[39:10.580 --> 39:11.840]  I can't watch penalties.
[39:12.300 --> 39:16.020]  That's a good thing that you don't have to because you're live on this show right now.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.060]  We're doing the show, so you don't have to watch penalties.
[39:21.060 --> 39:21.780]  Oh, shit.
[39:23.640 --> 39:24.360]  And cards.
[39:24.620 --> 39:25.720]  Yeah, we could go to...
[39:25.720 --> 39:25.860]  Okay.
[39:27.320 --> 39:27.680]  Luke...
[39:28.040 --> 39:29.580]  I'll be honest, I don't know who that is.
[39:30.400 --> 39:32.640]  I know a lot about basketball, and I don't know who that guy is.
[39:32.700 --> 39:34.040]  You guys are all upside down.
[39:34.280 --> 39:36.720]  This is Danilo Gallinari.
[39:37.620 --> 39:39.240]  2017, not a great year for basketball, huh?
[39:39.900 --> 39:41.700]  MKG, Michael K. Gilchrist.
[39:42.240 --> 39:43.880]  I don't know who that is either.
[39:44.680 --> 39:45.780]  Oh, Derek Jones Jr.
[39:46.320 --> 39:47.300]  Zero gravity card.
[39:47.380 --> 39:48.220]  That's not worth anything.
[39:48.320 --> 39:48.960]  Kyle Korver.
[39:49.460 --> 39:50.080]  He's a cool dude.
[39:50.740 --> 39:51.860]  Lonzo Ball rookie.
[39:52.460 --> 39:52.820]  Wow.
[39:52.980 --> 39:53.340]  Wow.
[39:53.520 --> 39:54.100]  Does that work?
[39:54.200 --> 39:54.560]  Wow.
[39:54.820 --> 39:55.180]  Okay.
[39:55.860 --> 39:56.580]  Thanks for that one.
[39:57.120 --> 39:58.760]  That was briefly a very hot card.
[39:58.760 --> 39:59.680]  We'll move on to the next one.
[39:59.680 --> 40:01.200]  Yeah, in 2017-2018.
[40:01.980 --> 40:03.200]  Through most of 2017.
[40:04.620 --> 40:07.180]  I got to go to Lonzo Ball's very first basketball game.
[40:07.540 --> 40:08.140]  Wow, bummer.
[40:08.440 --> 40:12.580]  I know, it was Clippers-Lakers in LA, obviously, you know?
[40:13.020 --> 40:15.200]  And it was the opening game of the season that year.
[40:15.700 --> 40:18.800]  And Fareed from Rooster Teeth and I went, and...
[40:18.800 --> 40:19.300]  Clippers won?
[40:20.300 --> 40:22.980]  Fucking Patrick Beverley locked Lonzo Ball down.
[40:23.060 --> 40:23.160]  Yeah.
[40:23.400 --> 40:24.240]  It was brutal.
[40:24.420 --> 40:24.960]  He came out, and he was like...
[40:24.960 --> 40:26.660]  He shoved him to the ground, and he spit in his mouth.
[40:26.800 --> 40:28.340]  He said a lot of derogatory stuff.
[40:28.340 --> 40:30.400]  We'll move on to the next hour and a half to show you what the NBA is.
[40:30.420 --> 40:32.380]  Pat Beverles is an insane man.
[40:32.460 --> 40:32.740]  Yeah, he is.
[40:32.760 --> 40:33.300]  And I love that.
[40:33.360 --> 40:34.000]  And then he pushed him in the back.
[40:34.200 --> 40:34.320]  Yep.
[40:34.540 --> 40:35.340]  Did he become a doorknob?
[40:36.480 --> 40:37.600]  J.J. Reddick.
[40:37.980 --> 40:38.540]  Larry Nantz.
[40:39.020 --> 40:39.740]  Oh, yeah.
[40:40.120 --> 40:42.360]  Reddick in his brief 76er stint.
[40:42.440 --> 40:43.200]  Those long, long...
[40:43.200 --> 40:44.260]  Those are in, like, long shorts.
[40:44.460 --> 40:45.320]  Jonathan Isaac.
[40:46.060 --> 40:46.860]  Faces of the Future, huh?
[40:46.860 --> 40:48.720]  Turns out he wasn't a Face of the Future, but okay.
[40:48.880 --> 40:49.360]  Ronald Baker.
[40:50.140 --> 40:50.780]  Eric Gordon.
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.200]  That was the most looking like they're being sucked off that we've had yet.
[40:56.380 --> 40:56.880]  Which one?
[41:00.400 --> 41:01.140]  That blue one.
[41:01.600 --> 41:03.260]  Oh, that one? He looks like he's being sucked off?
[41:03.440 --> 41:04.580]  Well, more than most.
[41:04.740 --> 41:07.620]  Yeah, he's got the hands up.
[41:07.940 --> 41:09.140]  Can we get the suck-off cam?
[41:09.660 --> 41:11.000]  Yeah, can we go to card cam?
[41:11.240 --> 41:12.000]  Can we get suck-off cam?
[41:13.500 --> 41:14.560]  I see it, I see it.
[41:14.640 --> 41:14.740]  Yeah.
[41:15.780 --> 41:19.940]  Oh, Cody Zeller, one of the two Zeller brothers in the NBA.
[41:20.220 --> 41:22.080]  His brother, Tyler, played for the Celtics for a while.
[41:22.500 --> 41:23.220]  You don't need to know that.
[41:23.320 --> 41:23.500]  Nope.
[41:23.860 --> 41:25.160]  Devin Harris.
[41:26.200 --> 41:26.920]  Kent Bazemore.
[41:26.920 --> 41:31.920]  Dude, what was going on in the NBA in 2017, 2018? Like, nothing? There's like pop-up cards, dude.
[41:31.920 --> 41:31.940]  Yeah, not a lot.
[41:31.940 --> 41:32.660]  This is raw.
[41:33.920 --> 41:35.640]  You got a hot Ivan Raab rookie.
[41:36.020 --> 41:36.920]  Is that Raab himself?
[41:37.140 --> 41:37.620]  Westbrook.
[41:37.700 --> 41:40.540]  Ivan Raab himself. Russell Westbrook.
[41:40.620 --> 41:42.520]  I guess cool. Westbrook.
[41:43.220 --> 41:44.760]  What? Hang on, what is that pose?
[41:45.240 --> 41:47.260]  Okay, that's a pretty good CJ McCollum pose.
[41:48.580 --> 41:50.080]  CJ McCollum's doing the gremlin.
[41:50.460 --> 41:52.580]  Yeah, I like that. Let's save that.
[41:52.880 --> 41:53.220]  Thriller.
[41:54.800 --> 41:57.460]  He's a really good dude. He got kind of fucked over by Brooklyn.
[41:57.560 --> 41:58.900]  So you're excited to open these, huh?
[41:59.020 --> 41:59.180]  Yeah.
[42:00.720 --> 42:01.660]  How much you got left?
[42:01.920 --> 42:04.660]  Oh, I got a lot left. We got 5, 6, 7, 8, 8 or 9.
[42:05.020 --> 42:05.400]  And a bunch.
[42:06.260 --> 42:06.820]  It's 443.
[42:07.180 --> 42:09.700]  Alright, and then we got all the other cards in the world that we'll never get.
[42:09.720 --> 42:10.640]  The time's down there, Eric.
[42:11.040 --> 42:11.820]  Oh, yeah, 444.
[42:12.080 --> 42:12.680]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[42:13.540 --> 42:14.100]  Tim Frazier.
[42:15.040 --> 42:18.000]  We got Omar Asic. I don't think he's in the NBA anymore.
[42:18.160 --> 42:18.780]  No, I don't think so.
[42:18.860 --> 42:21.380]  He used to play for Houston. He got dealt to...
[42:21.380 --> 42:23.200]  He's probably in...
[42:23.200 --> 42:24.420]  Probably EuroLeague.
[42:25.920 --> 42:26.680]  Wade Baldwin.
[42:27.120 --> 42:27.500]  The fourth.
[42:27.800 --> 42:29.940]  The fourth. OG and a newbie. That's a rookie card.
[42:30.040 --> 42:30.200]  Yep.
[42:30.400 --> 42:31.140]  He's doing pretty well.
[42:31.640 --> 42:34.760]  Draymond Green. He's the guy you love him if he's on your team.
[42:34.940 --> 42:37.880]  And if you're the other 29 teams, you can't fucking stand him.
[42:38.280 --> 42:39.260]  Which means he's a good player.
[42:39.880 --> 42:43.740]  Bismack Biambo. Man, that dude had a run with Toronto.
[42:44.080 --> 42:46.720]  And then he had a little bit of heat and went to Orlando and disappeared.
[42:47.800 --> 42:48.600]  Carmelo Anthony.
[42:49.000 --> 42:49.740]  Yeah, baby!
[42:50.140 --> 42:50.660]  Chris Paul.
[42:51.140 --> 42:51.600]  There you go.
[42:51.660 --> 42:52.660]  There you go. CP3.
[42:52.660 --> 42:56.360]  A lot has changed since 2017-2018 with Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul.
[42:57.220 --> 42:57.860]  A whole lot.
[42:57.980 --> 42:59.340]  Just those two players.
[42:59.860 --> 43:00.840]  They were on the same team briefly.
[43:00.940 --> 43:02.000]  I don't think they ever shared the court.
[43:02.240 --> 43:02.400]  Nope.
[43:03.540 --> 43:05.260]  One of them is going to win an NBA championship.
[43:05.540 --> 43:08.960]  So these are actually probably worth some money now.
[43:09.580 --> 43:11.420]  Oh, that one's definitely...
[43:11.420 --> 43:13.120]  It's probably pretty hot.
[43:13.160 --> 43:13.500]  Definitely.
[43:14.300 --> 43:15.360]  Happy about that one.
[43:15.920 --> 43:18.240]  Wesley Wundu, rookie. Chris Paul again.
[43:18.240 --> 43:19.440]  That's a double. This is the same one.
[43:19.840 --> 43:20.500]  CP3 double.
[43:20.960 --> 43:21.500]  Oh, here we go.
[43:21.500 --> 43:22.180]  Oh, great.
[43:23.080 --> 43:24.280]  Kyrie? Is this Kyrie?
[43:24.660 --> 43:25.360]  Oh, no!
[43:25.860 --> 43:26.680]  Kyrie Irving, wow.
[43:26.720 --> 43:27.000]  No!
[43:27.800 --> 43:28.140]  Yeah.
[43:28.360 --> 43:29.960]  Here he is getting scored on.
[43:31.180 --> 43:33.320]  That guy in the background, that's a huge head.
[43:33.800 --> 43:34.600]  Lance Stevenson.
[43:35.340 --> 43:39.400]  Lance Stevenson, one of the most interesting people in the history of the NBA.
[43:40.040 --> 43:44.080]  Lance Stevenson, famous for blowing in LeBron's ear.
[43:44.520 --> 43:45.620]  Oh, that's that guy!
[43:45.800 --> 43:47.620]  And untying people's shoes.
[43:47.760 --> 43:48.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[43:48.620 --> 43:48.900]  Cool.
[43:49.120 --> 43:50.360]  What would he blow in someone's ear for?
[43:50.360 --> 43:51.680]  To piss them off and be annoying.
[43:52.240 --> 43:53.380]  Could you imagine?
[43:53.640 --> 43:54.640]  He was like the me of the NBA.
[43:54.840 --> 44:00.120]  If you were heated and you're like, I'm ready to go, we're going to play, this is going to be like a battle.
[44:00.260 --> 44:01.360]  And then a guy just went...
[44:02.700 --> 44:04.860]  I'd lose my mind. I don't know what I'd do.
[44:04.960 --> 44:08.200]  That's a great card for people whose head is a basketball.
[44:08.820 --> 44:10.200]  If we're making a pile of them.
[44:13.540 --> 44:14.060]  This one?
[44:14.120 --> 44:15.400]  Yeah, because look at the...
[44:15.400 --> 44:15.520]  Oh!
[44:18.800 --> 44:23.960]  I didn't understand what you were saying at all.
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.520]  That's why it's important that you're here, Gavin. You notice stuff we don't.
[44:26.640 --> 44:27.920]  Oh, here's a...
[44:27.920 --> 44:29.460]  You know, overseeing observations.
[44:29.700 --> 44:33.000]  We've switched from 2017 Hoops to 2017 Giannis.
[44:33.200 --> 44:34.580]  That is a little, little man.
[44:35.120 --> 44:36.180]  Why is he so small?
[44:37.240 --> 44:42.040]  As ISO Joe Johnson, he had about 30 years there. Really interesting years.
[44:42.460 --> 44:44.640]  TJ Leafrookie, boy, do I have a lot of those.
[44:44.640 --> 44:46.160]  I didn't think he was really playing a game.
[44:46.520 --> 44:48.900]  That's the only court time he ever had.
[44:49.180 --> 44:50.660]  Oh, Ante Zizek.
[44:50.800 --> 44:54.440]  Ante Zizek, he... I don't know that he... I think he got traded to...
[44:54.440 --> 44:55.240]  Euro League?
[44:55.960 --> 44:57.100]  G Fuel League or whatever.
[44:58.400 --> 45:01.500]  Oh, all clear for... Look at his face!
[45:02.020 --> 45:03.680]  Look at his stupid ass face!
[45:03.700 --> 45:05.200]  All clear for consultation.
[45:06.260 --> 45:07.100]  Come on, Pickford.
[45:07.340 --> 45:12.020]  Gary Harris, Drew Holliday, MKG again.
[45:12.180 --> 45:12.960]  Come on, Pickford!
[45:12.960 --> 45:15.640]  I like Drew Holliday because he spells his name with a J.
[45:16.300 --> 45:19.480]  His name is Drew. Spelled Drew.
[45:19.820 --> 45:22.320]  Drew Holliday has interesting shoulders.
[45:22.780 --> 45:24.660]  Every time I see Drew Holliday, I think about his shoulders.
[45:25.500 --> 45:25.800]  Boy.
[45:26.440 --> 45:28.100]  They're kind of rounded in a weird way.
[45:29.240 --> 45:30.360]  Tough, tough defense.
[45:30.380 --> 45:31.160]  Gavin, how's that kick going?
[45:31.780 --> 45:33.100]  Italy scored a penalty.
[45:34.840 --> 45:36.400]  You got Hayward?
[45:36.600 --> 45:38.080]  Yeah, he's got a flaw on the card at the bottom.
[45:38.280 --> 45:38.900]  Oh, no.
[45:39.880 --> 45:41.240]  You can, you can see it right there.
[45:41.520 --> 45:42.160]  Throwing the trash.
[45:46.020 --> 45:46.900]  Brooke Lopez.
[45:47.300 --> 45:50.740]  How is this guy still in the NBA?
[45:50.920 --> 45:51.340]  No idea.
[45:51.680 --> 45:52.900]  Still performing very well.
[45:53.120 --> 45:55.460]  The most unassuming dude who makes his team.
[45:57.240 --> 45:58.900]  His brother looks like Sideshow Bob with that hair.
[45:59.240 --> 45:59.600]  Uh-huh.
[45:59.800 --> 46:01.060]  Oh, great, another Kyrie Irving.
[46:01.520 --> 46:01.880]  Yeah, what's up?
[46:02.640 --> 46:05.700]  Oh, Frank Winston Jr., rookie jersey.
[46:06.800 --> 46:07.740]  Wow, cool.
[46:09.000 --> 46:10.020]  Oh, there's a Shaq card.
[46:10.180 --> 46:11.260]  Oh, big Shaq card. Shaq Attack?
[46:11.580 --> 46:12.140]  Shaq Attack.
[46:13.200 --> 46:13.900]  It's right there.
[46:14.260 --> 46:15.260]  It's right here.
[46:15.880 --> 46:16.900]  Back in the box?
[46:17.660 --> 46:18.160]  Well, it's...
[46:18.160 --> 46:18.600]  He's a collector.
[46:18.660 --> 46:21.200]  Markel Fultz, this poor motherfucker, rookie of...
[46:21.720 --> 46:22.880]  Did he get rookie of the year that year?
[46:23.420 --> 46:24.180]  They broke...
[46:24.180 --> 46:24.240]  Fultz?
[46:24.520 --> 46:25.740]  He was drafted first.
[46:26.060 --> 46:30.800]  They fucking broke his shot in Philly, and then he just has been dumped around the league.
[46:30.920 --> 46:32.020]  I don't know if he's fixed it yet.
[46:32.160 --> 46:32.820]  Felt bad for him.
[46:32.940 --> 46:34.760]  Rudy Gobert and Kyle Lowry.
[46:36.920 --> 46:37.720]  2017, 18.
[46:38.260 --> 46:41.160]  He's traded back from Fultz, right, to get the tandem pick?
[46:41.160 --> 46:43.540]  Like, Fultz is key in the tandem chase card.
[46:43.880 --> 46:44.140]  Yeah.
[46:44.180 --> 46:47.420]  The Celtics won the draft that year when Fultz was number one.
[46:48.520 --> 46:49.160]  What's up, Geoff?
[46:49.680 --> 46:50.020]  Safe.
[46:52.120 --> 46:53.320]  That's an excellent point.
[46:53.620 --> 46:54.680]  That's an excellent point, Gavin.
[46:55.120 --> 46:55.560]  Andrew.
[46:56.060 --> 46:57.980]  This is the best time we could have had this.
[46:58.560 --> 46:58.960]  Hey, AD.
[46:59.300 --> 47:00.220]  There's Klay Thompson.
[47:00.800 --> 47:02.860]  He hasn't played basketball in two and a half years.
[47:02.860 --> 47:03.920]  I was gonna say, where's he been?
[47:04.160 --> 47:04.940]  He's rehabbing.
[47:05.320 --> 47:06.560]  He fucking...
[47:06.560 --> 47:06.960]  Did he break his leg?
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.520]  He tore his hamstring or something.
[47:09.520 --> 47:15.940]  And then he was playing a pickup game as he was rehabbing, a year into rehab.
[47:16.300 --> 47:17.520]  And in the pickup game, he tore his ACL.
[47:18.100 --> 47:19.960]  Yeah, so he's not gonna be playing again for a long time.
[47:20.000 --> 47:20.260]  Jesus.
[47:20.500 --> 47:21.240]  This dude...
[47:21.720 --> 47:22.120]  Yeah.
[47:23.300 --> 47:24.020]  Not a huge fan.
[47:24.280 --> 47:25.260]  Al Horford.
[47:26.100 --> 47:27.420]  He's back at the Celtics again.
[47:27.880 --> 47:28.640]  Lucky for him.
[47:29.340 --> 47:32.100]  Sweet Lou Williams, playing for Atlanta right now.
[47:32.760 --> 47:34.100]  Couldn't help him take it all the way.
[47:34.200 --> 47:34.660]  Oh, great.
[47:34.860 --> 47:35.180]  Who's that?
[47:35.260 --> 47:36.560]  Oh, wow, that's cool.
[47:36.660 --> 47:37.280]  Jaylan Brown.
[47:37.540 --> 47:38.680]  I've never seen this card before.
[47:38.680 --> 47:40.380]  Year two card for Jaylan Brown.
[47:40.680 --> 47:41.500]  He's all clear for day one.
[47:41.500 --> 47:42.940]  Wesley Wundu again.
[47:43.140 --> 47:43.780]  JJ Redick again.
[47:44.460 --> 47:45.080]  And Derek White.
[47:45.160 --> 47:46.800]  Probably getting every rookie but the one I want.
[47:46.880 --> 47:47.300]  Yeah, baby.
[47:47.940 --> 47:49.860]  We got this pack and one more pack?
[47:50.100 --> 47:51.000]  And then two more packs.
[47:51.020 --> 47:51.740]  Oh, and then two more packs.
[47:51.740 --> 47:52.580]  Then two more different packs.
[47:52.640 --> 47:54.520]  We got this pack and one more pack and then two different packs.
[47:54.620 --> 47:56.160]  Yeah, we have two packs like this and then a different pack.
[47:56.160 --> 47:56.580]  Uh-oh.
[47:57.780 --> 47:58.220]  $4.50.
[47:58.560 --> 47:59.200]  Okay, $4.50?
[47:59.540 --> 48:00.040]  You better hurry up.
[48:00.340 --> 48:01.800]  All right, Zach Randolph.
[48:02.040 --> 48:03.120]  His nickname was Zeebo.
[48:03.300 --> 48:04.680]  I named my character in...
[48:05.100 --> 48:09.020]  I named my character in the Bigfoot Let's Play series after Zach Randolph.
[48:09.020 --> 48:09.540]  Did you really?
[48:09.840 --> 48:10.500]  That's awesome.
[48:11.080 --> 48:12.160]  I don't know, but I hate him.
[48:12.200 --> 48:13.940]  He's one of my least favorite players in the history of basketball.
[48:14.000 --> 48:14.060]  That's awesome.
[48:14.260 --> 48:15.120]  It wasn't...
[48:15.120 --> 48:16.920]  Yeah, but I like the name Zeebo.
[48:17.160 --> 48:17.680]  So, Frank...
[48:19.860 --> 48:20.460]  I'm open.
[48:21.440 --> 48:22.080]  Kawhi Leonard.
[48:22.320 --> 48:23.160]  Hey, all right.
[48:23.240 --> 48:23.960]  De'Aaron Fox.
[48:23.960 --> 48:24.700]  What it do, baby?
[48:25.360 --> 48:27.180]  The champ is here, Kevin Durant.
[48:27.200 --> 48:27.680]  Yeah, okay.
[48:28.060 --> 48:28.460]  Whatever.
[48:29.020 --> 48:30.260]  Blake Griffin, Chris Dunn.
[48:30.680 --> 48:31.500]  Let's see the...
[48:31.500 --> 48:32.920]  Blake Griffin went any good or no?
[48:33.240 --> 48:33.560]  Nah.
[48:33.560 --> 48:36.520]  It's back when he stole a clipper back when he was pretty broken.
[48:37.680 --> 48:38.840]  All right, here we go.
[48:38.940 --> 48:39.640]  Kevin, how's it looking?
[48:40.340 --> 48:40.900]  Is it coming home?
[48:41.900 --> 48:42.760]  Is it already home?
[48:43.000 --> 48:43.660]  No, it's not home.
[48:43.860 --> 48:44.280]  Where is it?
[48:44.300 --> 48:46.180]  Let's not even be talking about whether or not it's coming home.
[48:46.340 --> 48:47.960]  Let's not say anything, all right?
[48:49.120 --> 48:50.280]  Let's not make any predictions.
[48:50.620 --> 48:51.360]  Who's predicting?
[48:52.620 --> 48:54.460]  If we were going to make a prediction, who would we predict?
[48:54.940 --> 48:57.360]  That's one saved for England still.
[48:58.240 --> 48:58.960]  Rodney Hood.
[48:59.200 --> 49:00.200]  This will make it 3-2.
[49:00.260 --> 49:01.060]  Luke Kinnard.
[49:01.140 --> 49:02.740]  Wow, he looks dumb as hell.
[49:03.700 --> 49:08.040]  Luke Kinnard looks like he doesn't understand what he's doing or where he is.
[49:08.240 --> 49:12.040]  He also looks like he was like, I am way too pale.
[49:12.200 --> 49:13.760]  I need to go get a tan before I get a photo.
[49:13.980 --> 49:15.560]  And he went and he's like, blast me.
[49:15.660 --> 49:16.280]  Oh, baby.
[49:16.700 --> 49:17.540]  That's cool.
[49:18.180 --> 49:18.800]  John Wall.
[49:18.880 --> 49:20.920]  I like those jerseys.
[49:21.140 --> 49:22.220]  The Washington jerseys.
[49:22.300 --> 49:22.680]  No!
[49:25.540 --> 49:27.020]  Don't talk about it.
[49:27.120 --> 49:28.220]  Don't predict anything.
[49:28.240 --> 49:30.680]  He was pissing about and then he hit the post.
[49:31.040 --> 49:32.780]  He was pissing about and he hit the post.
[49:32.940 --> 49:33.920]  Rookie jersey.
[49:34.460 --> 49:34.980]  Bam, bam.
[49:35.380 --> 49:35.740]  Autobio.
[49:36.080 --> 49:36.640]  That's a hit.
[49:36.900 --> 49:37.400]  That's a good one.
[49:37.920 --> 49:39.160]  Oh, another one, baby.
[49:39.860 --> 49:42.240]  They can't give you enough Alonzo Ball rookies.
[49:42.420 --> 49:44.300]  God damn it, these Alonzo Ball rookies.
[49:44.420 --> 49:45.320]  Cool, J.J. Barea.
[49:46.220 --> 49:47.000]  That's what I wanted.
[49:48.660 --> 49:50.480]  So that was your last chance to get what you wanted, huh?
[49:50.640 --> 49:51.540]  Wait, wait, wait.
[49:51.720 --> 49:52.200]  Show this.
[49:52.460 --> 49:53.220]  What is this?
[49:53.240 --> 49:54.100]  It's a fat pack.
[49:54.300 --> 49:54.820]  Jumbo pack.
[49:54.860 --> 49:55.780]  What is a fat pack?
[49:56.060 --> 49:56.840]  Look at this shit.
[49:57.080 --> 49:58.060]  Yeah, it's a fat pack.
[49:58.180 --> 49:58.640]  That's insane.
[49:59.380 --> 50:01.920]  You have to stop saying it and just say what it is.
[50:01.960 --> 50:02.320]  Why not?
[50:02.500 --> 50:03.180]  It's called a fat pack.
[50:03.360 --> 50:04.840]  I understand what it's called.
[50:05.320 --> 50:05.920]  Why not only buy fat packs?
[50:06.020 --> 50:06.940]  That's what I'm saying.
[50:07.220 --> 50:08.120]  I buy what I can get.
[50:08.200 --> 50:08.880]  These are five years old.
[50:08.900 --> 50:10.360]  No, but I mean, why do they sell small ones?
[50:10.360 --> 50:11.180]  Oh, I don't know, dude.
[50:11.500 --> 50:14.840]  Frank Kaminsky, Etwan Moore, Zat Zeebo again.
[50:15.420 --> 50:16.720]  We're back at the hoops, obviously.
[50:16.840 --> 50:18.720]  Rodney Stuckey, Nerlens Noel.
[50:19.240 --> 50:20.920]  I always thought he would have a bigger crew than he did.
[50:21.020 --> 50:21.540]  I like him a lot.
[50:22.100 --> 50:28.420]  Dwight Howard, one of the worst reputations for locker room boys in the history of the NBA.
[50:28.420 --> 50:30.160]  But as an underneath big man, he does.
[50:31.540 --> 50:32.240]  He shows up.
[50:33.420 --> 50:35.640]  Wilson Chandler, Biznack Biombo again.
[50:36.100 --> 50:36.760]  A career that should have happened.
[50:36.840 --> 50:39.400]  Tyler Johnson, Boban Marjanovic.
[50:39.680 --> 50:40.600]  Love it.
[50:41.020 --> 50:42.280]  That's a cool name.
[50:42.580 --> 50:43.560]  Boban Marjanovic.
[50:43.780 --> 50:46.360]  He is currently playing for Dallas.
[50:46.500 --> 50:49.340]  He is, what's his face, Luca's best friend.
[50:50.460 --> 50:51.200]  Up by John Wick.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.260]  Yeah, he was in John Wick, too.
[50:53.680 --> 50:54.420]  Tristan Thompson.
[50:54.680 --> 50:55.760]  It says Italy has three.
[50:56.620 --> 50:58.040]  Rashawn Holmes has three what?
[50:58.040 --> 50:59.070]  Oh, no!
[51:00.480 --> 51:00.900]  Kicks.
[51:02.200 --> 51:02.940]  Oh, no.
[51:03.720 --> 51:04.400]  Gavin's upset.
[51:04.600 --> 51:05.340]  Gavin left.
[51:05.620 --> 51:06.360]  We got another Kobe.
[51:06.580 --> 51:07.740]  Gavin's going home.
[51:08.940 --> 51:09.980]  He's coming home.
[51:10.100 --> 51:11.820]  He's going home.
[51:12.980 --> 51:13.820]  Don't worry, Gavin's coming home.
[51:13.820 --> 51:14.900]  He's going home.
[51:15.040 --> 51:15.700]  Tyler Ferguson.
[51:16.200 --> 51:16.900]  All right, cards.
[51:17.160 --> 51:17.460]  Zubox.
[51:17.580 --> 51:18.560]  Zubox is doing pretty well.
[51:18.740 --> 51:19.080]  Oh, well, he was.
[51:19.080 --> 51:19.680]  Cards, go.
[51:20.700 --> 51:22.540]  Juwan Evans, Kay Felder.
[51:22.720 --> 51:23.360]  Oh, Jared Allen.
[51:23.540 --> 51:23.800]  Oh, Jared.
[51:23.920 --> 51:24.420]  I met that guy.
[51:24.460 --> 51:25.380]  Jared Allen's a cool dude.
[51:25.480 --> 51:26.460]  He's familiar with Rooster Teeth.
[51:26.460 --> 51:27.700]  He follows Gavin and I am.
[51:27.940 --> 51:28.780]  I met him at Razor.
[51:28.800 --> 51:31.300]  When I worked at Razor, he came in, and he was like, I'm here.
[51:31.400 --> 51:32.840]  Can I check the place out?
[51:32.880 --> 51:33.720]  I'm like, yeah, come here.
[51:33.840 --> 51:34.540]  Here's a keyboard.
[51:35.220 --> 51:36.020]  Come hang out.
[51:36.120 --> 51:37.300]  He's a big gamer, too.
[51:37.880 --> 51:38.820]  He's a really cool dude.
[51:38.900 --> 51:39.640]  He is a really cool dude.
[51:39.940 --> 51:42.320]  Plays for Cleveland currently, I believe.
[51:43.000 --> 51:43.640]  Caleb Swannigan.
[51:43.780 --> 51:44.520]  Oh, Dario Sarek.
[51:45.280 --> 51:45.300]  Uh-oh.
[51:45.300 --> 51:45.520]  What?
[51:45.660 --> 51:45.740]  What?
[51:46.160 --> 51:46.440]  Uh-oh.
[51:46.880 --> 51:47.520]  Isaiah Thomas.
[51:47.820 --> 51:48.020]  Yeah.
[51:49.320 --> 51:49.840]  Fucked me up.
[51:49.920 --> 51:50.960]  That would happen.
[51:51.080 --> 51:51.360]  Isaiah Thomas.
[51:52.780 --> 51:53.420]  Dario Sarek.
[51:53.420 --> 51:54.300]  Oh, Dario Sarek.
[51:54.300 --> 51:57.760]  Uh, this is, uh, like, uh, Explosion Parallel.
[51:58.140 --> 51:59.320]  Like, Teal Explosion Parallel.
[51:59.660 --> 52:00.220]  Caleb Swannigan.
[52:00.360 --> 52:00.740]  I've never heard of him.
[52:01.220 --> 52:02.240]  Uh, CJ McCollum.
[52:02.300 --> 52:04.280]  Oh, he's got the same, he's got the Gargoyles.
[52:04.280 --> 52:05.420]  Oh, he's doing Gargoyles again.
[52:05.560 --> 52:07.320]  Geoff T.
[52:07.380 --> 52:08.180]  Mad Facts are cool.
[52:08.400 --> 52:09.160]  You've got another Carmelo.
[52:10.600 --> 52:11.620]  Chris Paul again.
[52:11.980 --> 52:12.680]  That was a good one?
[52:13.120 --> 52:13.700]  Was that a good one?
[52:14.000 --> 52:14.580]  Was that good?
[52:14.620 --> 52:15.280]  Did you like that?
[52:15.880 --> 52:16.740]  Billy Colley Stein.
[52:16.840 --> 52:17.440]  Little Marcus Aldrich.
[52:17.660 --> 52:19.360]  Had to retire for blood clots.
[52:19.520 --> 52:20.040]  Oh, no.
[52:21.060 --> 52:22.960]  He demanded out of San Antonio.
[52:23.180 --> 52:23.660]  Went to...
[52:23.660 --> 52:25.300]  So his life is, like, just different now, huh?
[52:25.300 --> 52:25.960]  Dude, his life's different.
[52:26.100 --> 52:27.640]  He demanded out of San Antonio.
[52:27.760 --> 52:28.220]  They let him go.
[52:28.300 --> 52:31.840]  He signed, like, I think that minimum with Brooklyn to ring chase.
[52:32.020 --> 52:34.480]  And then in the physical, I think, found out he had blood clots.
[52:34.480 --> 52:36.020]  They're like, your blood, it's all clotted.
[52:36.280 --> 52:37.380]  Same thing that got Chris Bosch.
[52:37.500 --> 52:38.340]  And so he had to retire.
[52:38.640 --> 52:39.800]  This should be just blood.
[52:41.280 --> 52:42.700]  This is mostly clots.
[52:42.920 --> 52:43.080]  Yeah.
[52:43.560 --> 52:44.040]  All right.
[52:44.220 --> 52:45.160]  Geoff, is this your last quick pack?
[52:45.160 --> 52:47.300]  I've never opened a pack of essentials before.
[52:47.400 --> 52:47.900]  I don't even know what's in it.
[52:47.900 --> 52:48.660]  Oh, my God.
[52:49.060 --> 52:49.560]  Very excited.
[52:49.600 --> 52:51.360]  Does it need to go in the pack sack?
[52:52.240 --> 52:53.140]  Fuck off, man.
[52:54.740 --> 52:55.980]  I don't even know what these look like.
[52:56.060 --> 52:56.260]  Let's go.
[52:56.420 --> 52:57.880]  We got Lonzo Ball, rookie.
[52:57.940 --> 52:58.260]  Stop!
[52:59.200 --> 53:01.180]  Goddamn, that would have been a major card.
[53:01.380 --> 53:01.580]  When?
[53:01.840 --> 53:02.620]  If he had a career.
[53:02.760 --> 53:02.880]  Yeah.
[53:03.440 --> 53:04.460]  And he's still good at some point.
[53:05.620 --> 53:06.600]  Uh, Kevin Durant.
[53:07.100 --> 53:07.920]  Yeah, that's probably worth a lot.
[53:07.920 --> 53:08.200]  That's pretty.
[53:08.920 --> 53:09.160]  I don't know.
[53:09.900 --> 53:10.540]  Jonathan Simmons.
[53:10.660 --> 53:10.920]  All right.
[53:11.020 --> 53:11.700]  Don't know who that is.
[53:12.200 --> 53:14.140]  That's a gorgeous card, though.
[53:14.200 --> 53:14.460]  Mm-hmm.
[53:14.820 --> 53:15.800]  These cards are nice.
[53:16.520 --> 53:18.920]  Uh, Etuan Moore again.
[53:19.660 --> 53:20.800]  And Antonio Blakeney.
[53:21.740 --> 53:22.020]  I don't know.
[53:22.380 --> 53:22.740]  Blakeney.
[53:23.340 --> 53:23.700]  Damn.
[53:24.380 --> 53:25.400]  What's going on with you, Gav?
[53:26.040 --> 53:28.200]  Do you want to give us a footy check?
[53:28.240 --> 53:29.380]  Hey, Gavin, is this good or bad?
[53:30.380 --> 53:30.840]  Did it?
[53:31.700 --> 53:32.580]  How are we doing on time?
[53:33.400 --> 53:34.120]  4.55.
[53:34.520 --> 53:35.740]  Well, we'll open up some Zoom.
[53:36.200 --> 53:36.880]  How many times...
[53:36.880 --> 53:38.140]  How many minutes do we have?
[53:38.180 --> 53:38.620]  Five minutes?
[53:40.560 --> 53:41.180]  Somebody yell.
[53:41.800 --> 53:43.160]  Maybe we'll get lucky and end on a...
[53:43.160 --> 53:43.580]  About five minutes?
[53:44.440 --> 53:44.660]  Cool.
[53:44.660 --> 53:45.940]  Maybe we'll get lucky and end on a Zoom.
[53:45.940 --> 53:46.760]  Oh, what if we end on a Zoom?
[53:46.840 --> 53:47.440]  Gavin, how are you doing?
[53:47.540 --> 53:48.280]  Mike Teneman.
[53:48.800 --> 53:49.600]  Frank DePino.
[53:50.180 --> 53:51.120]  Future star Greg Colbin.
[53:51.180 --> 53:51.720]  He was not.
[53:51.840 --> 53:52.020]  No.
[53:52.980 --> 53:53.380]  Checklist.
[53:53.400 --> 53:54.960]  Casey Candale.
[53:56.220 --> 53:56.620]  Candelli?
[53:56.780 --> 53:57.000]  Is that it?
[53:57.040 --> 53:57.480]  I can't remember.
[53:57.740 --> 53:58.420]  Dwayne Ward.
[53:58.600 --> 53:58.620]  Geoff Kunkel.
[53:58.620 --> 54:01.780]  I would love if those jackets came back into style.
[54:01.940 --> 54:02.280]  Which one?
[54:02.280 --> 54:02.500]  These?
[54:02.600 --> 54:02.880]  Yeah.
[54:03.600 --> 54:04.520]  They're just cool.
[54:04.580 --> 54:04.920]  Those are cool.
[54:05.020 --> 54:05.880]  Don Mattingly.
[54:06.060 --> 54:06.260]  Mm-hmm.
[54:08.720 --> 54:09.520]  Steve Frey.
[54:09.620 --> 54:10.140]  Bobby Valentine.
[54:10.360 --> 54:10.880]  Manager card.
[54:10.960 --> 54:11.720]  Jose Aquendo.
[54:12.340 --> 54:13.020]  Joe Torre.
[54:13.020 --> 54:14.120]  Look at that.
[54:14.240 --> 54:16.700]  He was the Yankees manager for a long time, too.
[54:16.900 --> 54:17.660]  Dick Schofield.
[54:18.420 --> 54:19.380]  What's going on, Gavver?
[54:20.220 --> 54:21.200]  It didn't come home, Greg.
[54:21.820 --> 54:23.120]  It didn't come home.
[54:24.480 --> 54:26.000]  It didn't go home.
[54:26.060 --> 54:27.220]  It stayed away.
[54:28.100 --> 54:28.680]  What happened?
[54:29.860 --> 54:30.980]  What's the final score?
[54:31.680 --> 54:33.440]  One to one, but they won in penalties.
[54:34.660 --> 54:35.560]  Oh, who won?
[54:36.040 --> 54:36.560]  The England one?
[54:36.820 --> 54:37.540]  No, the other one.
[54:37.660 --> 54:38.340]  The England one?
[54:40.240 --> 54:41.900]  I think England won.
[54:42.420 --> 54:42.860]  Nope.
[54:43.560 --> 54:45.160]  I'm more Italian than British.
[54:46.680 --> 54:48.740]  According to your accent, no, you're not.
[54:49.280 --> 54:50.820]  I also haven't been there that much.
[54:54.160 --> 54:54.880]  Oh, shit.
[54:55.160 --> 54:55.820]  Oh, man.
[54:55.860 --> 54:57.220]  That was a rough one for you, huh?
[54:57.300 --> 54:58.060]  Oh, man.
[54:58.700 --> 54:59.420]  What are we doing?
[54:59.620 --> 55:00.060]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[55:00.140 --> 55:01.040]  I'm going to end on...
[55:01.960 --> 55:04.400]  There's two minutes left and you've all bought in.
[55:04.720 --> 55:05.560]  Hey, so what are we doing?
[55:05.640 --> 55:06.400]  What is this show?
[55:06.600 --> 55:07.240]  Here's what we're going to do.
[55:07.240 --> 55:09.020]  We're going to end on Umbrella Academy.
[55:09.040 --> 55:09.580]  All right, here we go.
[55:09.640 --> 55:10.860]  And I'm pulling these for Rebecca.
[55:11.320 --> 55:11.660]  Rebecca!
[55:11.660 --> 55:12.140]  Rebecca!
[55:12.140 --> 55:13.220]  She was excited about these.
[55:13.680 --> 55:15.740]  So, Rebecca, hopefully I get you some cards that you think are cool.
[55:15.740 --> 55:16.440]  Rebecca, it's coming home!
[55:16.620 --> 55:17.120]  Oh, here we go.
[55:17.200 --> 55:17.800]  White Violin.
[55:17.900 --> 55:18.260]  Wow!
[55:18.720 --> 55:20.760]  This is when Elliot Page got very angry.
[55:20.920 --> 55:21.120]  Okay.
[55:21.760 --> 55:23.100]  Man on the Moon.
[55:23.460 --> 55:24.320]  That's already a song.
[55:24.760 --> 55:24.820]  Mask.
[55:25.020 --> 55:26.180]  That's with their masks.
[55:27.660 --> 55:28.060]  Wow!
[55:29.440 --> 55:32.660]  The framed artwork from Umbrella Academy.
[55:32.980 --> 55:34.320]  It was a dark and stormy night.
[55:34.640 --> 55:37.040]  They went in quietly like mice, one by one in a line.
[55:37.560 --> 55:39.000]  Oh, classic mice style.
[55:39.140 --> 55:39.860]  Man on the Moon.
[55:40.100 --> 55:41.180]  They put a man on the moon.
[55:41.180 --> 55:42.300]  That dude's dead a lot.
[55:42.500 --> 55:44.380]  And then, yeah, let's see what else.
[55:45.120 --> 55:45.520]  One more.
[55:45.640 --> 55:46.380]  And then we're going to go...
[55:46.380 --> 55:46.820]  What's coming up?
[55:46.980 --> 55:47.840]  What should we throw it to?
[55:48.100 --> 55:49.620]  Yeah, probably the hosts.
[55:49.980 --> 55:50.360]  The hosts.
[55:50.520 --> 55:50.660]  Yeah.
[55:51.640 --> 55:52.420]  They've got stuff to say.
[55:52.420 --> 55:53.340]  Coming up after us.
[55:53.420 --> 55:59.580]  There is a G Fuel tournament going on after this where Gamists will play...
[56:01.300 --> 56:02.620]  Oh, look at this.
[56:02.660 --> 56:03.260]  With fans.
[56:03.500 --> 56:04.700]  So you can tune in for that.
[56:04.760 --> 56:05.220]  Thanks, G Fuel.
[56:05.320 --> 56:06.500]  Oh, is that a Diego card?
[56:06.500 --> 56:08.280]  And a special Diego card.
[56:08.560 --> 56:10.060]  He's like the Batman of the group.
[56:10.060 --> 56:12.480]  Or really more like the Robin of the group, honestly.
[56:12.800 --> 56:15.720]  If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.
[56:16.260 --> 56:17.180]  Look at this guy.
[56:17.280 --> 56:18.000]  Oh, there he is.
[56:18.140 --> 56:19.180]  There's the brother.
[56:19.480 --> 56:20.240]  We already have that one.
[56:20.500 --> 56:20.820]  Yeah.
[56:20.980 --> 56:21.880]  Oh, and there's number five.
[56:22.680 --> 56:24.060]  Is this after he killed number five?
[56:25.200 --> 56:28.780]  I think it's after he saw that the world was destroyed.
[56:29.240 --> 56:29.960]  Oh, no.
[56:29.960 --> 56:31.440]  He had to go back in time.
[56:32.780 --> 56:34.160]  Gavin, does it feel like the world's been destroyed?
[56:35.080 --> 56:36.100]  A little bit for you, maybe.
[56:36.900 --> 56:37.480]  The moon.
[56:37.480 --> 56:39.880]  Harness your Italy.
[56:40.760 --> 56:41.860]  Harness your Italian heritage.
[56:42.040 --> 56:42.660]  We're going to keep opening it.
[56:45.440 --> 56:46.540]  Any good cards here, Geoff?
[56:47.460 --> 56:50.200]  There's one where she's a bloody on the floor.
[56:50.620 --> 56:51.140]  That's a rough one.
[56:51.780 --> 56:52.520]  Oh, I heard a rumor.
[56:52.660 --> 56:53.360]  That's because her power.
[56:53.680 --> 56:54.640]  She can say, I heard a rumor.
[56:54.780 --> 56:56.220]  And then she can tell you stuff, and then you believe it.
[56:56.240 --> 56:57.120]  And then you do what she tells you.
[56:57.400 --> 56:58.420]  I guess that's it.
[56:58.560 --> 57:00.400]  So they won 2020, but it's 2021?
[57:01.940 --> 57:03.700]  Yeah, why are they playing last year?
[57:04.040 --> 57:04.720]  Yeah, what the hell?
[57:05.340 --> 57:06.800]  Are they in the Umbrella Academy?
[57:06.800 --> 57:10.200]  Look at all the hot hits we got today, guys.

[57:16.420 --> 57:16.980]  We got Diego.
[57:17.300 --> 57:19.100]  We got Bobby Valentine Manager.
[57:19.100 --> 57:20.740]  Look at what happened to this button.
[57:21.320 --> 57:22.400]  Gavin broke the button?
[57:22.560 --> 57:26.940]  Now look, if you want this to happen, pound on it when they lose Euro.

[57:50.180 --> 57:52.840]  Thank you to G Fuel and RTX at home.
[57:53.420 --> 57:55.420]  And I don't know, everyone in the booth.
[57:55.520 --> 57:59.200]  And Wes, who was kind of like laughing at Gavin the whole time, which I really appreciated, honestly.
[57:59.320 --> 58:00.340]  I like that a lot.
[58:00.880 --> 58:06.220]  So, guys, we're going to throw... I thought you were going to break that pencil.
[58:07.180 --> 58:11.340]  Geoff, any final words, parting words that you want to leave our folks with here?
[58:11.620 --> 58:15.240]  As in all things, thank you for tuning in.

[58:25.600 --> 58:26.420]  All things to Zim.
[58:26.520 --> 58:27.640]  Andrew, can you Zim Zim for us?
[58:27.740 --> 58:28.080]  Zim Zim.
[58:28.080 --> 58:28.720]  I'm Zimming.
[58:28.940 --> 58:29.420]  I'm Zimming.
[58:29.460 --> 58:30.280]  I bet he is.
[58:31.040 --> 58:32.060]  Zim Zim, comment leavers.
[58:32.260 --> 58:32.460]  Yep.
