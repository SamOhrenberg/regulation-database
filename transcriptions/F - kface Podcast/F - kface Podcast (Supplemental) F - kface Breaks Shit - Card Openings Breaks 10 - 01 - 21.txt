[00:06.970 --> 00:13.630]  Hello! And welcome to another episode of Some Kind of Fuckface Breaks Shit.
[00:14.230 --> 00:16.970]  Boy, you're in for a treat this week, because...
[00:17.590 --> 00:24.210]  Well, as always, Fuckface Breaks Shit stars myself, producer Eric, Andrew piping in from Canada.
[00:25.530 --> 00:29.950]  The invitation... well, let me tell you. First off, welcome Emily Hatfield.
[00:30.490 --> 00:34.790]  Emily, really appreciate you jumping in at the last minute.
[00:35.490 --> 00:39.090]  Because, well, we had a reason for you to be here. You were going to be here at the tail end.
[00:39.190 --> 00:41.710]  You're our surprise guest. We're going to do this whole Barbie thing.
[00:41.810 --> 00:45.470]  I've had these Barbie cards for a while. You had a great idea for how to use the Barbie cards.
[00:45.770 --> 00:47.690]  The whole thing has been fantastic. I was really excited about it.
[00:48.930 --> 00:50.950]  However, then... I don't know which camera to look in.
[00:51.330 --> 00:52.730]  At this one? Then...
[00:52.730 --> 00:53.930]  You can see the monitor.
[00:54.210 --> 00:56.390]  How can I see the monitor and the camera at the same time?
[00:56.490 --> 00:57.050]  Oh my god.
[00:57.810 --> 01:00.490]  My eyes go this way. I don't do that.
[01:01.230 --> 01:04.270]  Although I did find out, Emily and I were crossing our eyes recently.
[01:05.430 --> 01:08.710]  We were crossing our eyes recently and we found out only one of my eyes crosses.
[01:09.710 --> 01:12.310]  My eyes go like this. Straight, crooked.
[01:12.570 --> 01:12.750]  What?
[01:12.990 --> 01:14.930]  Yeah, apparently I don't turn both. Only one turns.
[01:14.990 --> 01:15.690]  Maybe you're sick.
[01:16.470 --> 01:18.510]  Why are you crossing eyes?
[01:18.710 --> 01:19.090]  It's fun.
[01:19.270 --> 01:19.930]  Is this just a thing?
[01:20.250 --> 01:20.970]  Yeah, who's fucking around?
[01:21.010 --> 01:22.150]  I'm just curious about his activity.
[01:22.410 --> 01:23.930]  This is what we do with our time.
[01:24.010 --> 01:25.110]  Yeah, what else am I doing? I don't drink anymore.
[01:27.550 --> 01:31.750]  That's what there is left. You sit and soberly cross your eyes.
[01:32.170 --> 01:36.530]  So anyway, as always, Gavin Free is supposed to be here.
[01:38.630 --> 01:39.310]  There you go.
[01:39.710 --> 01:45.550]  And then the invite went out to Jack Petillo as it does Minor League Fan Jack every episode.
[01:46.170 --> 01:49.030]  I texted him this morning. I said, hey Jack, just wanted to see if you're coming.
[01:49.350 --> 01:52.630]  And he sent me a picture of him at Disneyland and said, wish you were here.
[01:53.190 --> 01:54.670]  Or Disney World, sorry. Disney World.
[01:55.630 --> 01:59.770]  So Jack fucked off and didn't show up again. He's O for every one of these.
[02:00.190 --> 02:01.250]  Oh, Gavin decided to show up.
[02:02.070 --> 02:02.830]  What's up?
[02:04.150 --> 02:04.910]  Laundry day, huh?
[02:05.770 --> 02:11.090]  So I'm wearing my special break shit shorts, but this time they're covered in paint.
[02:11.930 --> 02:12.830]  What's the paint from?
[02:13.270 --> 02:13.790]  I've been painting.
[02:14.630 --> 02:15.350]  Have you been painting?
[02:15.530 --> 02:15.690]  Yeah.
[02:16.270 --> 02:17.490]  For like slow-mo guys?
[02:17.630 --> 02:17.830]  Yeah.
[02:18.230 --> 02:21.310]  Yeah? For like a bit or just to make it pretty?
[02:21.310 --> 02:21.810]  No, for making a video.
[02:22.250 --> 02:22.550]  Oh.
[02:22.770 --> 02:23.430]  Spinning paint around.
[02:23.790 --> 02:24.610]  Spinning paint around.
[02:25.010 --> 02:26.910]  Alright, well thanks for showing up. Appreciate it.
[02:26.910 --> 02:31.190]  Are you sad that Emily's in charge of Soundboard now?
[02:31.310 --> 02:33.090]  Emily's filling in as you since you weren't showing up.
[02:33.410 --> 02:34.710]  It's fine. It's a lot of stress to be honest.
[02:35.450 --> 02:35.810]  Stop!
[02:36.310 --> 02:37.070]  That's what I was saying.
[02:37.310 --> 02:37.670]  What?
[02:38.150 --> 02:39.390]  I don't know. We're working on it.
[02:39.490 --> 02:40.230]  Can you do that again?
[02:40.650 --> 02:41.470]  Don't do it again then.
[02:42.670 --> 02:43.550]  She's good at this.
[02:43.750 --> 02:44.030]  Alright.
[02:45.090 --> 02:47.130]  Go crazy. It's your role now.
[02:50.970 --> 02:52.190]  Got the hang of it immediately.
[02:52.670 --> 02:54.050]  Got the hang of it immediately.
[02:54.450 --> 03:00.250]  I was just explaining to them, Jack didn't show as always. He did the thing that you do.
[03:00.690 --> 03:00.990]  What's that?
[03:01.390 --> 03:05.810]  When I used to run Achievement Hunter, the other job, I would text Gavin and say,
[03:05.890 --> 03:10.370]  Hey, we're doing the Let's Play at 11 today. Do you think you'll be in?
[03:10.670 --> 03:14.050]  And he would just send me a photo of him on a plane with a cocktail.
[03:14.770 --> 03:18.310]  And I would go, does that mean... and he's like, yeah, I'm on my way to England.
[03:18.470 --> 03:20.910]  And I'd be like, oh, so you're not going to make the video?
[03:21.770 --> 03:23.930]  Jack today, I was like, hey, are you going to be here for the video?
[03:24.010 --> 03:26.810]  And he sent me a picture of him at Disney World and just said, wish you were here.
[03:27.110 --> 03:28.710]  And I was like, well, I wish you were here.
[03:28.810 --> 03:30.530]  I mean, at least you had time to film a Let's Play though.
[03:30.990 --> 03:32.630]  When was this planned, this break shit?
[03:34.490 --> 03:35.050]  Weeks ago.
[03:35.210 --> 03:35.690]  Oh, yeah.
[03:35.890 --> 03:37.330]  It was...
[03:37.330 --> 03:38.310]  We had talked about it.
[03:38.310 --> 03:39.110]  It was on Fuckface.
[03:39.130 --> 03:40.290]  And I kept putting it in the Slack.
[03:40.730 --> 03:42.330]  On the Slack, Eric, everybody.
[03:42.330 --> 03:44.210]  I'm not free today. This was a pain in the ass.
[03:44.410 --> 03:44.690]  What?
[03:44.790 --> 03:49.010]  Yeah, I never said I was available, but you know, at least I'm here now.
[03:49.590 --> 03:49.910]  What?
[03:51.090 --> 03:54.030]  You were also on a Let's Play we were supposed to do earlier in Worms.
[03:54.430 --> 03:55.290]  No, I wasn't on that either.
[03:55.390 --> 03:57.110]  I showed up for it.
[03:59.490 --> 04:04.330]  Well, Kevin, thanks for showing up for the thing that you agreed or didn't agree to do.
[04:05.950 --> 04:07.690]  I rushed here as fast as I could.
[04:08.130 --> 04:09.210]  When did you find out about this?
[04:09.250 --> 04:12.390]  I found out earlier today, but I had just a shit load of stuff.
[04:13.010 --> 04:15.390]  I was like, where is this? What is this? What are we doing this?
[04:15.870 --> 04:17.310]  We talked about this yesterday.
[04:17.310 --> 04:18.930]  I have nothing to do with it.
[04:20.070 --> 04:23.190]  No, we literally, the last thing I said to you was, I'll see you tomorrow.
[04:23.190 --> 04:26.130]  And you said, yeah, we have that thing. We have the stream.
[04:26.210 --> 04:26.630]  What?
[04:28.630 --> 04:29.050]  See?
[04:29.370 --> 04:30.070]  Talk about it.
[04:30.490 --> 04:33.130]  Unreliable narrator. You just can't trust this.
[04:33.530 --> 04:35.210]  You absolutely can't trust this.
[04:35.490 --> 04:38.290]  Did you hear Julio saying the Keenity Kill rap? Are you aware of that?
[04:40.790 --> 04:43.290]  We probably have it on fucking recorded.
[04:43.490 --> 04:44.570]  I'd love it on audio.
[04:44.630 --> 04:44.930]  I'd love to divide it.
[04:44.990 --> 04:45.690]  Oh, man.
[04:45.690 --> 04:48.650]  Well, if you're too busy, if you need to go paint, you need to go.
[04:48.790 --> 04:49.490]  It's incredible.
[04:49.750 --> 04:50.530]  Or whatever.
[04:50.810 --> 04:51.950]  Yeah, we have Emily on soundboard.
[04:52.030 --> 04:53.930]  She can't leave now.
[04:54.010 --> 04:54.530]  She's already here.
[04:54.630 --> 04:55.070]  She's stuck.
[04:55.490 --> 04:56.750]  I don't know who that one was.
[04:59.010 --> 05:01.290]  Well, might as well get into it.
[05:03.250 --> 05:04.050]  Admin complete.
[05:05.510 --> 05:05.910]  Gavin's...
[05:06.670 --> 05:11.470]  It sounds like Gavin's going to be about as here as he was during the soccer game.
[05:11.550 --> 05:13.090]  Oh, no, I'm all here now.
[05:13.090 --> 05:13.970]  I'm just...
[05:13.970 --> 05:15.270]  Just annoyed to be here.
[05:15.290 --> 05:15.810]  Three minutes too late.
[05:15.910 --> 05:17.330]  No, no, I'm just sweaty.
[05:17.550 --> 05:18.410]  That's really all it is.
[05:18.890 --> 05:20.010]  I'm just really hot.
[05:20.270 --> 05:22.450]  Just drive here as fast as you could or what?
[05:24.190 --> 05:28.010]  We filmed a fuck face yesterday, as we do every Thursday.
[05:28.730 --> 05:35.010]  And all... I don't want to give anything away, but all I will say is I got so sweaty at one point.
[05:35.070 --> 05:36.030]  Oh, my God.
[05:36.030 --> 05:38.350]  Sweat was beating on my arms.
[05:38.450 --> 05:39.590]  I was watching it drop.
[05:39.890 --> 05:41.490]  My whole body was on fire.
[05:41.490 --> 05:42.970]  And I was like...
[05:42.970 --> 05:45.630]  And I had to turn the AC down after the podcast.
[05:45.690 --> 05:46.590]  I was so hot.
[05:47.230 --> 05:47.470]  Yes.
[05:48.950 --> 05:51.790]  I told her about it when we were done yesterday.
[05:52.110 --> 05:55.250]  I messaged her and just said like, hey, Geoff did this.
[05:55.870 --> 05:57.510]  Have fun with the rest of your night.
[05:59.230 --> 06:01.930]  So I encourage that we order really spicy chicken.
[06:05.450 --> 06:08.750]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:08.970 --> 06:10.490]  Well, I knew something was up because...
[06:11.250 --> 06:14.430]  Anything I can say to further this conversation would spoil fuck face.
[06:14.490 --> 06:15.010]  I don't want to do that.
[06:15.230 --> 06:17.150]  We don't want to spoil fuck face with this dumb show.
[06:18.510 --> 06:19.570]  Which we should probably get into.
[06:19.990 --> 06:21.330]  Anyway, long story short.
[06:21.970 --> 06:22.610]  Jack's not here.
[06:22.690 --> 06:23.750]  Gavin's sort of here.
[06:24.410 --> 06:25.170]  I'm all the way here.
[06:25.350 --> 06:26.310]  What do you want from me now?
[06:26.550 --> 06:26.830]  Are you?
[06:27.410 --> 06:28.510]  Are you all the way here?
[06:28.590 --> 06:29.090]  Yeah, look.
[06:29.690 --> 06:30.830]  He doesn't want to be here, though.
[06:31.110 --> 06:31.930]  I do want to be here.
[06:32.030 --> 06:32.470]  I know he's mad.
[06:32.650 --> 06:33.330]  I want to be here.
[06:33.430 --> 06:34.170]  I like doing these.
[06:34.850 --> 06:36.170]  It was very inconvenient for him.
[06:36.630 --> 06:37.150]  I'm really sorry.
[06:37.870 --> 06:39.550]  How much more notice is good for you?
[06:39.550 --> 06:41.790]  How can I find out if you're available?
[06:42.950 --> 06:43.510]  Ask me.
[06:43.810 --> 06:45.330]  Say, are you free on Friday?
[06:45.830 --> 06:47.510]  Are you free for this thing that we're doing?
[06:47.590 --> 06:48.950]  We got the whole channel paying on fuck face.
[06:49.170 --> 06:53.750]  The only thing I assume you check is just the fuck face channel.
[06:53.850 --> 06:55.290]  Hey channel, is this good?
[06:55.830 --> 06:56.470]  Weeks ago.
[06:59.690 --> 07:00.790]  It's so good to see you.
[07:01.870 --> 07:03.070]  I love you so much.
[07:03.510 --> 07:05.110]  It's the best doing this with you.
[07:05.310 --> 07:07.870]  I feed off your enthusiasm, so I'm glad you're in such a good mood.
[07:07.870 --> 07:10.530]  I love these, and I'm genuinely very happy to be here.
[07:11.570 --> 07:14.510]  It's not an ideal day, but I'm very happy to be here.
[07:14.510 --> 07:19.390]  That's a great shot of just Gavin next to Don Zimmer on the screen.
[07:20.530 --> 07:22.370]  All right, we've discovered...
[07:22.370 --> 07:23.150]  We don't know why.
[07:23.310 --> 07:24.490]  We don't know what to do with this.
[07:24.570 --> 07:27.670]  I stuck that on there, but now we've realized that a Zim wheel is a thing.
[07:27.830 --> 07:28.450]  The wheel of Zim.
[07:28.690 --> 07:30.010]  It's like a Rolls Royce.
[07:30.090 --> 07:31.270]  He doesn't spin with the wheel.
[07:33.970 --> 07:34.870]  Look at it.
[07:34.870 --> 07:36.750]  It's just like a Rolls Royce.
[07:37.870 --> 07:38.730]  Look at it.
[07:45.230 --> 07:46.930]  We'll figure out what to do with the Zim.
[07:50.810 --> 07:51.770]  The wheel of Zim.
[07:51.870 --> 07:53.850]  We can like glue cards to it or something.
[07:53.990 --> 07:56.250]  Can I show this off real quick before we get into the card opening?
[07:56.430 --> 07:59.390]  A guy named Leaf sent me this.
[08:00.390 --> 08:00.750]  LeafGarrett?
[08:01.290 --> 08:02.290]  Nope, different guy.
[08:02.630 --> 08:03.690]  Is LeafGarrett alive?
[08:03.990 --> 08:04.930]  I think he's dead.
[08:05.010 --> 08:05.570]  I think he might be dead.
[08:05.670 --> 08:06.170]  I think he might be dead.
[08:06.170 --> 08:08.170]  He sent me...
[08:08.170 --> 08:09.750]  A Don Zimmer book.
[08:11.810 --> 08:13.050]  A Don Zimmer card.
[08:13.950 --> 08:14.750]  And also...
[08:14.750 --> 08:16.170]  The book is autographed...
[08:16.690 --> 08:17.510]  By a Don Zimmer.
[08:17.970 --> 08:18.310]  No!
[08:18.570 --> 08:19.470]  He got an...
[08:20.450 --> 08:20.850]  Best...
[08:20.850 --> 08:22.150]  What does it say? Regards?
[08:22.290 --> 08:22.710]  Best regards.
[08:22.930 --> 08:23.630]  Best regards.
[08:24.330 --> 08:25.390]  That's a classy dude.
[08:25.470 --> 08:27.590]  That might be the best thing you could ever get signed in here.
[08:27.710 --> 08:29.810]  When you say best wishes, it's like, yeah, whatever.
[08:29.930 --> 08:32.370]  But when you say best regards, that's an elevated human being.
[08:33.370 --> 08:34.090]  I like his...
[08:34.090 --> 08:35.870]  He's looking coy on the front of this.
[08:35.870 --> 08:37.050]  He's looking cheeky.
[08:37.490 --> 08:39.890]  Has he ever looked like that on the baseball...
[08:39.890 --> 08:40.390]  Pitch?
[08:42.630 --> 08:43.090]  Baseball...
[08:43.090 --> 08:43.510]  Grass?
[08:43.730 --> 08:43.830]  What?
[08:45.750 --> 08:47.390]  The baseball grass, yeah.
[08:47.690 --> 08:48.770]  The baseball pitch!
[08:49.030 --> 08:50.610]  When he manages for the baseball grass?
[08:53.850 --> 08:54.310]  Anyways.
[08:54.510 --> 08:55.310]  Thanks for coming!
[08:55.710 --> 08:57.150]  You'll have to let us know how it is.
[08:58.610 --> 08:59.950]  He's walked in...
[08:59.950 --> 09:01.570]  And it's just been being mean to you.
[09:01.570 --> 09:04.670]  And I can't stop sweating.
[09:06.510 --> 09:08.210]  I ran like half a mile.
[09:08.670 --> 09:09.170]  Well, let me tell you...
[09:09.170 --> 09:10.810]  Does the entire field baseball grass?
[09:10.950 --> 09:12.490]  Where does the baseball grass end?
[09:13.250 --> 09:17.190]  Let me tell you, if you're sweating already, I have some things for you not to try.
[09:17.430 --> 09:17.710]  Okay.
[09:19.370 --> 09:20.270]  How'd you cut your finger?
[09:20.950 --> 09:23.210]  Do you want me to get you a band-aid or something?
[09:23.350 --> 09:25.930]  No, it's like one of those cuts where the skin just closes up again.
[09:25.930 --> 09:26.810]  Oh, yeah, yeah, those are good.
[09:26.990 --> 09:27.390]  You want some blood?
[09:27.930 --> 09:28.430]  I'm kidding.
[09:29.730 --> 09:30.090]  Uh...
[09:32.410 --> 09:34.670]  Emily, is this what you thought it was going to be like?
[09:34.810 --> 09:35.030]  Yes.
[09:35.790 --> 09:36.150]  Yes.
[09:36.350 --> 09:37.570]  She's watched every one from home.
[09:37.650 --> 09:38.210]  Oh, man.
[09:38.290 --> 09:40.330]  Like this. Oh...
[09:40.330 --> 09:41.450]  He's so wonderful.
[09:42.590 --> 09:43.550]  We did cover...
[09:43.550 --> 09:49.310]  I don't want to cover fuckface official regulation business on non-fuckface official regulation productions.
[09:49.650 --> 09:50.690]  This is a side production.
[09:50.870 --> 09:51.070]  Yeah.
[09:51.190 --> 09:52.650]  It has to feed in.
[09:52.790 --> 09:53.350]  Yeah, we can't yet.
[09:53.490 --> 09:54.370]  It can only feed down.
[09:54.470 --> 09:55.190]  It can't feed up, right?
[09:55.190 --> 10:01.430]  But I will say, today was a glorious day in the history of fuckface.
[10:04.250 --> 10:04.730]  Fuckface.
[10:06.190 --> 10:06.670]  Because...
[10:06.670 --> 10:08.170]  Give me that. At least I can take care of that.
[10:08.890 --> 10:10.310]  Okay, we'll see.
[10:10.790 --> 10:12.210]  I have a funny story about that, by the way, too.
[10:14.430 --> 10:16.070]  The bat knobs went on sale.
[10:16.370 --> 10:23.190]  And in about exactly an hour and nine minutes or so, we sold out of the thousand baseball knobs.
[10:23.190 --> 10:25.890]  I think there were like 300 gone after a few minutes.
[10:26.390 --> 10:27.290]  It was very fast.
[10:27.290 --> 10:29.750]  So thank you to everybody who bought a collectible knob.
[10:30.070 --> 10:33.670]  Know that you're not just buying the knob of a baseball bat.
[10:33.990 --> 10:42.810]  You are buying the experience of owning a piece of wood that lived in my house for two months,
[10:42.890 --> 10:46.130]  that I tripped over, that I moved from one room to another.
[10:46.250 --> 10:48.490]  Oh, somebody's coming to stay with us. We need to clean out the spare bedroom.
[10:49.350 --> 10:52.130]  Move the 700 boxes of knobs somewhere else.
[10:52.410 --> 10:55.470]  Oh, they've been in the living room too long. We can't clean. Move it to the other thing.
[10:55.570 --> 10:57.930]  Oh, you can't get to your computer anymore because there's knobs in the way.
[10:58.050 --> 10:59.070]  Move it back to the spare bedroom.
[11:00.370 --> 11:07.170]  And then I had to go through the process of denobbing the bats and then sanding them all,
[11:07.290 --> 11:09.910]  and then individually putting the serial number on each bat.
[11:10.010 --> 11:11.350]  Emily was there. She saw the whole process.
[11:11.510 --> 11:12.490]  It was excruciating.
[11:13.070 --> 11:15.890]  It took hundreds of thousands of hours, probably.
[11:16.170 --> 11:17.790]  You were very particular about it, too.
[11:17.790 --> 11:21.030]  You were very careful that they all went on really straight.
[11:21.110 --> 11:21.590]  On the right way.
[11:22.850 --> 11:23.490]  Quality product.
[11:23.690 --> 11:25.470]  The entire time or for the first few hundred?
[11:25.470 --> 11:26.350]  The entire time.
[11:26.390 --> 11:27.170]  That's very impressive.
[11:27.350 --> 11:28.250]  The entire time.
[11:28.250 --> 11:30.570]  Do you have one here that we can look at real quick?
[11:30.670 --> 11:31.330]  Yeah, so here's one.
[11:31.670 --> 11:33.310]  Gavin, what do you think about the size of that?
[11:36.370 --> 11:40.050]  This is number 654. This is one of the ones I kept. I kept a few.
[11:41.310 --> 11:43.150]  Yeah. Why'd you keep this number?
[11:44.010 --> 11:45.070]  Just picked it out randomly.
[11:45.190 --> 11:45.450]  Oh, okay.
[11:45.850 --> 11:46.870]  Is that a number that means something to you?
[11:46.870 --> 11:47.170]  No.
[11:47.550 --> 11:50.790]  That would be... if he was like 654, it's my lucky number.
[11:51.530 --> 11:52.090]  19 again?
[11:52.690 --> 11:55.730]  Because obviously I was hoping for, you know, the cabinet handle size.
[11:55.870 --> 11:56.210]  Right, right.
[11:56.390 --> 11:58.430]  I still want to use this as a cabinet handle.
[11:58.570 --> 11:58.870]  You can.
[11:59.010 --> 12:01.070]  Oh, I think that would be...
[12:01.070 --> 12:04.490]  This is where I keep the chips!
[12:05.590 --> 12:06.750]  My favorite cabinet handle.
[12:08.970 --> 12:11.290]  So anyway, thank you for the support.
[12:11.470 --> 12:12.670]  Thank you for buying these.
[12:12.790 --> 12:14.210]  This is one of the manufactured ones.
[12:14.290 --> 12:15.370]  This is one of the ones I cut.
[12:15.370 --> 12:18.950]  Although you wouldn't be able to tell based on the sanding job I did compared to this one.
[12:19.770 --> 12:21.470]  It's commiserate, I think, with quality.
[12:23.350 --> 12:25.070]  Anyway, talking about going down, not up.
[12:25.310 --> 12:31.470]  I will say that before this, Emily and I had a pastrami...
[12:31.470 --> 12:33.610]  Can I talk about... we need to open cards at some point.
[12:33.790 --> 12:34.070]  Pastrami.
[12:34.190 --> 12:35.350]  I'm a pastrami guy now.
[12:35.370 --> 12:35.490]  Yeah.
[12:35.750 --> 12:37.410]  I'm going to talk about this on Fuckface at some point.
[12:37.610 --> 12:40.150]  I'm really leaning heavy into pastrami and corned beef.
[12:40.250 --> 12:41.050]  I'm really into it.
[12:41.230 --> 12:44.810]  I want to start looking at pastrami content, pastrami merchandise, things we can do.
[12:44.810 --> 12:47.970]  It's really taking a hold within me.
[12:48.130 --> 12:50.130]  And I'm super... she knows, she's there for the whole thing.
[12:50.330 --> 12:51.710]  I'm super into pastrami.
[12:52.230 --> 12:55.830]  So over a pastrami sandwich, we had a great idea for what the next thing is.
[12:55.850 --> 12:58.110]  The evolution of the bat knobs to the next product.
[12:58.210 --> 13:01.390]  But I don't want to go further because that needs to happen on Fuckface.
[13:01.530 --> 13:02.110]  Yeah, right, right, right.
[13:02.170 --> 13:04.730]  But I just want you guys to know, the wheels are already in motion.
[13:04.910 --> 13:06.910]  I've already asked the products to be ordered.
[13:07.070 --> 13:09.090]  Andrew, how do you feel about pastrami?
[13:10.870 --> 13:12.330]  I'm kind of indifferent to it.
[13:12.330 --> 13:16.730]  I feel like there's something already lined up that's not pastrami related.
[13:16.910 --> 13:19.510]  So I'm interested in seeing the order of these things.
[13:20.910 --> 13:24.170]  Yeah, I don't know when we're going to throw the pastrami into it.
[13:24.350 --> 13:28.750]  This is just a realization I've had over the last few meals.
[13:29.290 --> 13:32.750]  I'm also still confused about the knobs and the bats to an extent.
[13:32.890 --> 13:34.150]  I don't know if we need to cover that.
[13:34.490 --> 13:36.070]  No, no, they're out the door, dude. They're gone.
[13:36.350 --> 13:37.230]  Wait, what do you mean?
[13:38.270 --> 13:39.110]  They're done!
[13:39.570 --> 13:41.430]  I ordered one. I'm still kind of...
[13:41.430 --> 13:43.970]  No, I'm still kind of confused about how some of it works.
[13:44.510 --> 13:46.850]  I don't... I don't... It might be a spoiler.
[13:47.370 --> 13:47.930]  I don't know.
[13:48.130 --> 13:49.630]  Well, they're all gone. It doesn't matter.
[13:50.110 --> 13:51.850]  I understand the confusion. I know what he's talking about.
[13:52.630 --> 13:55.110]  There's a layer to it that I'm kind of confused about.
[13:55.230 --> 13:56.050]  What's he talking about?
[13:56.690 --> 13:58.550]  But I don't... I don't... It might be a spoiler.
[13:59.070 --> 14:00.290]  I don't know if I can say it.
[14:00.330 --> 14:01.010]  Then don't.
[14:01.550 --> 14:02.190]  I mean, like...
[14:02.710 --> 14:05.050]  I just want a record of still confused, even though they're sold.
[14:05.390 --> 14:06.370]  Okay, cool. Hang on.
[14:07.650 --> 14:08.910]  Okay, it's on the record.
[14:09.010 --> 14:09.350]  In the minutes.
[14:09.550 --> 14:10.350]  You got it. Thank you.
[14:10.910 --> 14:12.670]  You got it. It's in the ledger.
[14:13.850 --> 14:16.990]  Anyway, big things at Footface World HQ.
[14:17.410 --> 14:23.510]  We are already jumping on the spiritual successor to the Bat Nobs, whether Andrew understands or not.
[14:23.650 --> 14:26.030]  The audience obviously does, because they bought it. Thank you.
[14:26.810 --> 14:29.510]  We should probably get into breaking some cards, though, now that we're...
[14:29.870 --> 14:31.570]  Oh, 18 or 19 minutes into this.
[14:31.570 --> 14:32.770]  Let's go. We got time to kill. It's fine.
[14:33.190 --> 14:34.230]  There's no theme to this...
[14:34.230 --> 14:37.530]  Well, the button at the end, the Barbie thing we're going to do at the end.
[14:38.010 --> 14:44.030]  But I think that the theme of this week will just be, like, random crap that we need to open so I can justify buying more crap.
[14:44.570 --> 14:47.510]  I have with me, as always, the pack sack.
[14:48.150 --> 14:48.790]  That's not what it says.
[14:50.910 --> 14:52.930]  Why don't you start with the pack sack?
[14:54.190 --> 14:54.710]  Thank you.
[14:55.490 --> 14:56.950]  You can see it clearly says...
[14:56.950 --> 14:57.290]  Sack pack.
[14:57.870 --> 14:58.270]  Pack.
[14:58.450 --> 14:58.810]  Sack.
[14:59.130 --> 14:59.290]  Pack.
[14:59.370 --> 14:59.710]  Sack.
[14:59.790 --> 15:00.250]  Sack pack.
[15:00.750 --> 15:01.110]  Sack.
[15:01.530 --> 15:02.050]  Sack pack.
[15:02.070 --> 15:02.390]  Pack sack.
[15:02.850 --> 15:05.010]  Oh, it's got the Disney thing on it for Jack.
[15:05.030 --> 15:05.590]  Yeah, always, man.
[15:05.630 --> 15:05.970]  That's fun.
[15:06.170 --> 15:09.150]  For minor league fan Jack. That's where he is right now, instead of being here, where he's supposed to be.
[15:09.250 --> 15:11.850]  So is Matt Breg the superfan? Is that what we've done here?
[15:12.330 --> 15:14.270]  Or is this just a body that we put a shirt on?
[15:14.270 --> 15:14.470]  He's the fan, isn't he?
[15:14.710 --> 15:15.030]  I...
[15:15.030 --> 15:15.310]  Okay.
[15:15.850 --> 15:19.070]  I thought I was talking through Matt Breg. I thought that was my representation.
[15:19.270 --> 15:20.670]  Oh, I was looking over there.
[15:21.530 --> 15:24.330]  Oh, do we need to look at Matt Breg? Well, okay. It's fine.
[15:24.790 --> 15:27.050]  Alright, so we'll start. I'm going to open up one pack for each of us.
[15:27.050 --> 15:31.310]  So this is the first thing I pulled from the pack sack. 1987 Topps Baseball.
[15:32.410 --> 15:33.550]  Who wants the gum?
[15:34.250 --> 15:34.490]  Emily?
[15:35.250 --> 15:36.710]  Have you done a gum powder yet?
[15:36.730 --> 15:37.830]  Wow, you got to eat the gum?
[15:38.750 --> 15:39.090]  Cool.
[15:40.570 --> 15:41.290]  Oh, God.
[15:41.390 --> 15:42.370]  It's like a Necco wafer.
[15:42.630 --> 15:44.670]  Oh, my God. That was so fucking loud.
[15:45.690 --> 15:46.650]  That was insane.
[15:47.610 --> 15:48.810]  No hesitation either.
[15:48.930 --> 15:50.170]  It's like a Necco wafer, they say.
[15:50.350 --> 15:51.390]  It's like a Necco wafer.
[15:51.830 --> 15:52.110]  Yeah.
[15:52.190 --> 15:53.290]  Alright, let's see what we got, Geoff.
[15:53.370 --> 15:56.930]  Alright, we got Joe Neska. These are the first baseball cards I bought in my entire life.
[15:56.930 --> 15:58.090]  1987 Topps, yeah.
[15:58.150 --> 15:58.750]  Did you swallow it?
[15:58.750 --> 15:59.650]  Our Geneseos are...
[15:59.650 --> 16:00.590]  Bruce Bochy!
[16:00.910 --> 16:02.670]  Bruce Bochy, that's a good looking card.
[16:02.970 --> 16:07.550]  The former manager of the San Diego Padres, former catcher, probably our next manager of the San Diego Padres.
[16:07.550 --> 16:11.170]  He looks like the guy Ace Ventura stole the dog from at the beginning of the movie.
[16:11.250 --> 16:15.150]  Yeah, we should do a lookalikes section. That's where Bruce is going to go.
[16:15.310 --> 16:16.130]  He's a coach.
[16:16.410 --> 16:16.830]  Mark Sullivan.
[16:16.850 --> 16:19.930]  Is he the only manager wearing a helmet in his photo? Why is he wearing a helmet?
[16:19.930 --> 16:20.630]  He's not a manager in this photo.
[16:20.630 --> 16:23.230]  He's not a manager at this point. This is when he was a major league catcher.
[16:23.270 --> 16:25.070]  He looks like he's holding a cross.
[16:25.510 --> 16:27.470]  Eric, you're a Padres fan, right?
[16:27.870 --> 16:27.950]  Yep.
[16:27.950 --> 16:34.070]  Let me ask you, just off the top of your head, do you know what Bruce Bochy batted in...
[16:34.910 --> 16:36.630]  Oh, I don't know, 86 for the Padres?
[16:36.710 --> 16:40.070]  It couldn't have been more than 240. So it was probably 231.
[16:40.350 --> 16:41.770]  Oh, that's close. 252.
[16:42.010 --> 16:42.930]  Really? Wow.
[16:42.950 --> 16:44.790]  Yeah, that was his best year.
[16:46.190 --> 16:49.930]  266. No, he had a 306 year when he only played 22 games for the Mets.
[16:50.070 --> 16:52.110]  I mean, that's what happens when you get a catcher who...
[16:52.950 --> 16:54.210]  Catchers don't hit. That's it.
[16:54.210 --> 16:57.470]  He also didn't play a lot of games for a fucking major league baseball player.
[16:57.890 --> 17:00.650]  Yeah, no, he's a great manager. Baseball, so-so.
[17:00.730 --> 17:03.550]  He batted 214 in 83 for the Padres.
[17:03.550 --> 17:06.590]  Well, he's a catcher. And also the Padres, not very good.
[17:06.730 --> 17:07.270]  Neil Allen.
[17:10.450 --> 17:12.010]  Let's put that over there. I don't know why.
[17:12.450 --> 17:13.310]  We gotta do something with that.
[17:13.710 --> 17:14.490]  Just happy to be here.
[17:14.650 --> 17:16.570]  Doug Sisk. Also a good card.
[17:16.630 --> 17:18.870]  Randy O'Neal. You guys see him in these?
[17:18.950 --> 17:19.170]  Uh-huh.
[17:20.230 --> 17:20.910]  Steve Yeager.
[17:22.270 --> 17:23.610]  He was one of my favorite players when I was a kid.
[17:23.610 --> 17:24.630]  Oda B. McDowell.
[17:24.630 --> 17:25.330]  Oh, baby.
[17:25.810 --> 17:30.530]  We got a Tops All-Star Rookie Cup card.
[17:30.630 --> 17:31.690]  Pete Incaveglia.
[17:34.270 --> 17:35.550]  Julio Cruz.
[17:35.750 --> 17:38.110]  These are baseball names, man. These are great.
[17:38.370 --> 17:39.510]  That's a pretty cool card.
[17:42.170 --> 17:43.450]  Mark Portugal.
[17:44.770 --> 17:45.990]  That's awesome.
[17:47.370 --> 17:51.370]  A level of awareness for these photos is raging so far.
[17:51.370 --> 17:54.810]  He has no clue that he's getting a photo taken for a baseball card.
[17:54.910 --> 17:58.150]  He looks kind of like Cheese on Reservation Dogs.
[17:58.590 --> 17:59.110]  Oh!
[17:59.190 --> 17:59.790]  A little bit.
[17:59.830 --> 18:01.030]  That boyish thing.
[18:01.750 --> 18:02.790]  Frank Wills.
[18:02.990 --> 18:05.210]  That's a hairy dude.
[18:05.970 --> 18:06.470]  Scott McGregor.
[18:07.530 --> 18:09.370]  People will never look like this again.
[18:09.570 --> 18:10.770]  You're 100% right.
[18:11.190 --> 18:13.690]  He looks like anything other than baseball.
[18:14.830 --> 18:16.350]  Like the guy underneath him.
[18:16.550 --> 18:17.610]  Podiatrist McGregor.
[18:17.890 --> 18:19.790]  That will never happen again on Earth.
[18:19.810 --> 18:20.150]  This guy?
[18:21.310 --> 18:21.950]  That look.
[18:23.030 --> 18:26.450]  That guy looks like every friend's dad I had growing up.
[18:27.810 --> 18:30.230]  I knew that guy, but I didn't know Frank Wills.
[18:30.390 --> 18:31.530]  He's got werewolf eyebrows.
[18:33.370 --> 18:34.010]  Charlie Kerrfield.
[18:35.530 --> 18:37.470]  And then Greg Pryor.
[18:37.590 --> 18:38.250]  I don't remember him.
[18:38.990 --> 18:40.790]  We got some weirdos we'll put in there.
[18:41.090 --> 18:42.270]  I'm going to start making these collections.
[18:42.430 --> 18:43.170]  We've been talking about it.
[18:43.190 --> 18:43.650]  We'll figure it out.
[18:43.730 --> 18:44.750]  That was the Geoff pack.
[18:45.570 --> 18:47.490]  Do you guys want to open up your own packs or do you want me to open up for you?
[18:47.510 --> 18:48.630]  No, I want you to open mine for me.
[18:48.630 --> 18:49.210]  Okay, Eric.
[18:49.310 --> 18:50.350]  You're getting...
[18:50.350 --> 18:52.550]  Oh, Eric gets Batman Returns.
[18:53.690 --> 18:55.270]  Wait, who was the bad guy in that one?
[18:55.690 --> 18:57.110]  Batman Returns?
[18:57.150 --> 18:57.850]  Was that Poison Ivy?
[18:57.910 --> 18:58.570]  Was that the bad one?
[18:58.810 --> 18:59.530]  Was that the awny one?
[18:59.550 --> 19:00.530]  No, Batman...
[19:00.530 --> 19:01.010]  That was...
[19:01.010 --> 19:02.170]  Batman Returns is the second one.
[19:02.410 --> 19:03.650]  Oh, that was Danny DeVito.
[19:03.830 --> 19:04.370]  It was Danny DeVito.
[19:05.010 --> 19:05.730]  Un pinguino.
[19:06.010 --> 19:06.950]  Yeah, Frank Reynolds.
[19:09.730 --> 19:10.890]  But that's still Michael Keaton, right?
[19:10.930 --> 19:11.970]  And he doesn't use a gun in that one?
[19:12.230 --> 19:12.250]  Yes.
[19:12.250 --> 19:13.410]  And Michelle Pfeiffer.
[19:13.470 --> 19:14.670]  But I think he could turn his head.
[19:15.230 --> 19:15.850]  Where am I?
[19:15.890 --> 19:16.750]  What's top and bottom?
[19:16.910 --> 19:17.550]  Okay, there we go.
[19:17.550 --> 19:18.230]  Oh, look at that.
[19:18.670 --> 19:19.030]  That's...
[19:19.030 --> 19:20.670]  Is that Batman's hanging himself, maybe?
[19:21.070 --> 19:21.230]  Or Catwoman?
[19:21.230 --> 19:22.350]  It's Catwoman and Penguin.
[19:22.570 --> 19:24.450]  You think Batman's hanging himself?
[19:24.750 --> 19:25.550]  Penguin's just watching.
[19:25.710 --> 19:26.230]  Penguin's watching.
[19:26.290 --> 19:27.770]  It looks like it's 16 big.
[19:27.770 --> 19:28.910]  Penguin's like, choose life.
[19:29.130 --> 19:30.830]  It looks like the penguin's graduating.
[19:31.270 --> 19:34.050]  What's on his head?
[19:34.930 --> 19:35.550]  It does.
[19:35.590 --> 19:37.210]  It looks like he's wearing a graduation cap.
[19:37.610 --> 19:38.230]  Can we look at it?
[19:38.250 --> 19:39.150]  We have a Penguin graduation card.
[19:39.170 --> 19:39.950]  Is that what it looks like?
[19:40.070 --> 19:40.310]  Yeah.
[19:40.430 --> 19:40.930]  That's great.
[19:41.090 --> 19:41.990]  We'll save that.
[19:42.170 --> 19:42.910]  Congratulations, Penguin.
[19:43.270 --> 19:44.370]  Here we have...
[19:44.370 --> 19:45.430]  Oh, he's talking to everyone.
[19:45.430 --> 19:47.490]  He's doing a one-man show.
[19:47.710 --> 19:49.830]  This is his John Leguizamo one-man show.
[19:52.270 --> 19:56.050]  I lived in New Jersey from 1997 to 1998.
[19:56.310 --> 19:56.370]  Right.
[19:56.730 --> 20:02.230]  And all anybody talked about for the entire year I lived there was John Leguizamo's one-man show.
[20:02.490 --> 20:06.010]  And how you gotta go up to the city to see John Leguizamo's one-man show.
[20:06.570 --> 20:06.910]  Why?
[20:07.110 --> 20:12.470]  I have no fucking clue, but nobody in the state of New Jersey would stop talking about him for the entire time I was there.
[20:12.730 --> 20:13.690]  Couldn't care less.
[20:13.910 --> 20:14.310]  No offense.
[20:14.310 --> 20:16.290]  Sure, he's a lovely dude, but I don't...
[20:16.290 --> 20:17.310]  So you didn't go?
[20:17.590 --> 20:17.850]  No.
[20:18.050 --> 20:19.130]  I couldn't afford it.
[20:20.650 --> 20:21.630]  Oh, some penguins.
[20:21.670 --> 20:22.410]  This is Penguin action.
[20:23.190 --> 20:24.370]  They're the rocket penguins.
[20:25.850 --> 20:30.090]  Then there's a shitty picture of Batman next to him.
[20:30.250 --> 20:33.570]  Interesting stills that have Batman so small.
[20:33.670 --> 20:35.130]  Yeah, what is this?
[20:35.150 --> 20:36.050]  This doesn't get any better.
[20:39.110 --> 20:40.150]  You trying to parse it?
[20:40.150 --> 20:40.970]  What do you guys think about that?
[20:40.970 --> 20:46.390]  Looks like a clown riding a stripper pole held by Atlas.
[20:46.850 --> 20:50.670]  I'll be honest, I'm for it. I think that's the best card we've pulled from this pack so far.
[20:52.330 --> 20:58.410]  Is that the smallest a main character has been as a solo member of a cod? Because that's not the category that we get.
[20:59.190 --> 21:03.490]  Oh, here's one. This is what appears to be Catwoman laughsturbating on a bed.
[21:05.970 --> 21:06.450]  Weird.
[21:07.230 --> 21:08.970]  We got ourselves a shadow.
[21:10.930 --> 21:12.750]  This card pack sucks.
[21:12.750 --> 21:14.230]  Oh, not for long.
[21:14.690 --> 21:18.010]  I think we're going to call this one a hit.
[21:18.070 --> 21:20.370]  Wait till you take a look at Danny DeVito.
[21:29.790 --> 21:31.390]  Here's Joey Pantaleone.
[21:31.650 --> 21:32.530]  No, what?
[21:32.630 --> 21:33.030]  Joey Pants.
[21:33.190 --> 21:33.450]  What?
[21:34.250 --> 21:35.350]  Oh, that's Michael Keaton.
[21:35.790 --> 21:38.950]  Do you understand that Geoff told me earlier today
[21:38.950 --> 21:40.930]  that he has 20-20 vision?
[21:41.010 --> 21:44.590]  I don't have 20-20 recognition.
[21:44.970 --> 21:46.550]  And here's Joey Pants.
[21:46.670 --> 21:47.970]  It looked like him from this angle.
[21:48.510 --> 21:52.150]  The one scene in the movie where Bruce Wayne was playing Joey Pants.
[21:52.950 --> 21:55.990]  In that Gina Gershon movie, right? Bound? It looks like him in that movie.
[21:57.370 --> 21:58.730]  Some more fucking penguins.
[22:00.110 --> 22:01.510]  Those are the best parts.
[22:02.870 --> 22:05.730]  Here's just a straight up Batman card. That actually looks like Batman.
[22:05.750 --> 22:06.950]  Oh, that looks terrible.
[22:07.290 --> 22:08.650]  Does it look like Michael Keaton?
[22:08.650 --> 22:09.470]  At all.
[22:09.490 --> 22:10.750]  No, that looks like Joey Pants.
[22:15.290 --> 22:17.530]  Here's Michelle Pfeiffer in her window in Amsterdam.
[22:17.930 --> 22:18.750]  Oh, that's cool.
[22:18.970 --> 22:19.810]  She's about to start her shift.
[22:20.770 --> 22:22.450]  Right by the barstoof.
[22:22.750 --> 22:23.530]  Cafe Barstoof.
[22:24.730 --> 22:26.950]  Is that a penguin look? Oh, it's a cat in the front.
[22:27.270 --> 22:27.790]  I thought it was a penguin.
[22:27.850 --> 22:28.830]  That's a prospective customer.
[22:29.830 --> 22:31.430]  He's trying to decide if he wants to go in or not.
[22:31.570 --> 22:32.730]  She's like, 75 euro.
[22:33.050 --> 22:33.770]  The cat?
[22:35.510 --> 22:37.350]  Okay, I don't know what to say about that.
[22:37.970 --> 22:39.470]  That's someone falling down a hole.
[22:39.490 --> 22:40.910]  It looks like a penguin falling down a hole.
[22:41.030 --> 22:43.250]  Is that Danny DeVito getting flushed down a toilet?
[22:43.450 --> 22:45.050]  Is that a penguin or the penguin?
[22:45.590 --> 22:46.070]  I don't know.
[22:46.310 --> 22:47.770]  The 2020 vision can't answer that question.
[22:49.810 --> 22:52.830]  There's a boring ass shot of Penguin and Catwoman.
[22:53.350 --> 22:55.130]  And then, oh, here's Batman.
[22:56.310 --> 23:00.170]  I think that's just the same picture from earlier, but further away.
[23:00.290 --> 23:00.870]  Further away, yeah.
[23:01.410 --> 23:02.930]  So that's Eric's pack.
[23:02.930 --> 23:03.610]  Oh, that sucks.
[23:04.170 --> 23:05.410]  Gavin, I'll open for you now.
[23:06.030 --> 23:08.330]  Gavin, are you excited about what it could be?
[23:08.650 --> 23:10.690]  Oh, you're getting a new addition of an Eric's!
[23:12.110 --> 23:12.810]  WWF Wrestling!
[23:13.490 --> 23:14.570]  Brother, brother!
[23:16.370 --> 23:17.170]  Big dude!
[23:17.890 --> 23:22.210]  Eric was telling me he went on a wrestling road trip this weekend.
[23:22.410 --> 23:24.610]  Saw some friends wrestle for New Japan Pro Wrestling.
[23:24.750 --> 23:25.250]  Where was that at?
[23:25.730 --> 23:26.950]  Beautiful Garland, Texas.
[23:27.270 --> 23:32.850]  Went out to Garland and saw buddy Alex Coghlan and a few other guys, Clark Connors and Carl Fredericks, go out there.
[23:32.870 --> 23:34.230]  Do they wrestle under those names?
[23:34.230 --> 23:36.850]  Yeah, and they're great wrestlers, man.
[23:36.850 --> 23:38.250]  What's the rest of Texas like?
[23:39.230 --> 23:39.950]  It's not good.
[23:40.730 --> 23:47.930]  We went out drinking at a bar in Plano, and you just go, so is anything else open? And they go, what do you mean? And you go, never mind.
[23:48.090 --> 23:49.250]  This is the bar.
[23:49.370 --> 23:50.750]  That's it, yeah. You're here.
[23:51.230 --> 23:54.630]  Here we go, WrestleMania 3 and still champion. This one Hulk Hogan won, I assume.
[23:55.170 --> 23:56.410]  He's pretty small, that one.
[23:56.410 --> 23:58.070]  Yeah, he's very tiny.
[23:58.390 --> 23:58.930]  Fucking tiny.
[23:59.190 --> 24:03.130]  They were, you know, come out on the big, because the walkway was so long, they were on these carts.
[24:03.130 --> 24:05.330]  Oh, right, the honky-tonk man.
[24:05.750 --> 24:07.770]  Oh, honky-tonk. Oh, you ain't nothing but a hound dog.
[24:08.410 --> 24:10.570]  Yeah, this reminds me of some...
[24:10.570 --> 24:11.670]  He's cool, he's cocky, he's bad.
[24:11.670 --> 24:12.870]  I can't figure it out, it reminds me of some...
[24:12.870 --> 24:16.090]  Well, this looks like it's on the Simpsons TV, so...
[24:17.150 --> 24:20.170]  And then there's Tama, I don't remember that character.
[24:20.450 --> 24:26.910]  It's one of the head-shrinkers, one of the Samoan SWAT team, and they're fighting demolition.
[24:27.530 --> 24:28.390]  Okay, there you go.
[24:28.410 --> 24:29.190]  Axe and smash!
[24:29.250 --> 24:32.510]  Oh, no, it looks like somebody finally got revenge on Randy.
[24:32.510 --> 24:37.450]  Oh, man, this is from Ricky the Dragon Steamboat beating up Macho Man Randy Savage.
[24:37.670 --> 24:38.750]  Maybe his best look.
[24:39.030 --> 24:39.250]  Oh, wow.
[24:39.250 --> 24:39.950]  Look at that, look at the hair.
[24:40.470 --> 24:42.350]  I don't... I feel like I remember this dude.
[24:42.870 --> 24:44.630]  King Harley Race, that's a sticker.
[24:44.950 --> 24:47.350]  Yeah, oh, really? That's cool, I might want that.
[24:47.470 --> 24:48.250]  Do we like him?
[24:48.410 --> 24:49.390]  Yeah, Harley Race is awesome.
[24:49.490 --> 24:49.910]  He's a good dude?
[24:50.030 --> 24:52.870]  Yeah, dude, he's cool as shit, he's such a good wrestler.
[24:53.290 --> 24:54.030]  Who's he king of?
[24:54.070 --> 24:55.110]  He looks like John C. Reilly.
[24:55.250 --> 24:57.250]  He does, he was the king of the ring.
[24:57.250 --> 25:03.790]  He was the king of the ring, and he won a tournament, and they crowned him King Harley Race.
[25:04.410 --> 25:05.650]  Here's Davey Boy Snow.
[25:05.890 --> 25:06.850]  That's the British Bulldog.
[25:07.070 --> 25:07.930]  That's the British Bulldog?
[25:08.530 --> 25:09.450]  Oh, look at him.
[25:09.710 --> 25:10.510]  That guy's British?
[25:10.710 --> 25:11.990]  Not in this picture, but he is.
[25:12.050 --> 25:14.170]  Yeah, not in that picture, but other ones, yeah.
[25:14.170 --> 25:15.410]  He's the most American-looking guy ever.
[25:15.650 --> 25:16.330]  There's the Honky Tonk Man.
[25:16.510 --> 25:16.830]  Oh, man, look at him.
[25:17.030 --> 25:17.990]  Honky Tonk Man rules.
[25:18.110 --> 25:18.790]  Uh-oh.
[25:19.090 --> 25:20.950]  There's Hulk Hogan answering a challenge.
[25:21.450 --> 25:22.690]  I don't know what the challenge was.
[25:22.750 --> 25:25.390]  Oh, with the challenge of fighting Andre the Giant, because it looks like he just won.
[25:27.170 --> 25:28.030]  There's a flip-flop.
[25:29.130 --> 25:32.330]  Wow! That's Rikishi at the top. I mean, no one remembers that, but...
[25:32.330 --> 25:33.190]  I'd do that with my nephew.
[25:33.650 --> 25:33.950]  Oh, really?
[25:34.750 --> 25:35.430]  That's pretty cool.
[25:35.450 --> 25:35.990]  He'd play an airplane.
[25:36.950 --> 25:39.470]  Oh, those are pretty solid. That's just a good card. This is Hogan flexing.
[25:39.910 --> 25:42.090]  Yeah, I mean, it's Hulk Hogan, so it's not that good, but, yeah, you know.
[25:42.130 --> 25:43.570]  22-inch pythons, right?
[25:43.630 --> 25:44.450]  Yeah, 24-inch pythons.
[25:44.930 --> 25:46.910]  Aren't you guys, isn't he like your hero, Hulk Hogan?
[25:47.050 --> 25:47.370]  No!
[25:47.530 --> 25:48.190]  Oh, you wrestlers?
[25:48.670 --> 25:51.230]  He's like the Michael Jordan of wrestling?
[25:51.370 --> 25:54.930]  Yeah, I mean, like, in the zeitgeist, like, culturally, yes, but...
[25:54.930 --> 25:57.670]  Who was that talk show host that he choked out and he, like, cut his head?
[25:57.670 --> 25:58.870]  Morton Downey Jr.?
[25:58.870 --> 26:00.690]  Yeah, but that wasn't him. Who was that?
[26:01.190 --> 26:03.410]  Robert Kind? Was it him? Richard?
[26:03.650 --> 26:04.450]  Richard something?
[26:04.470 --> 26:04.670]  You think?
[26:05.810 --> 26:06.890]  No, not Richard Kind.
[26:06.950 --> 26:07.690]  Oh, Richard Belzer.
[26:07.850 --> 26:08.090]  Yeah.
[26:08.410 --> 26:08.690]  Yeah!
[26:09.050 --> 26:10.250]  It was Richard Belzer, you're right.
[26:10.490 --> 26:10.870]  Yes!
[26:11.610 --> 26:16.630]  For you, I'm opening up Sportflix Magic Motion Baseball.
[26:16.650 --> 26:17.130]  Are you okay?
[26:17.250 --> 26:17.710]  Thank you.
[26:18.150 --> 26:18.830]  Thank you.
[26:19.590 --> 26:20.690]  That startle you?
[26:20.850 --> 26:22.090]  Did that make you...
[26:22.590 --> 26:24.190]  Like, you choked on it, like...
[26:24.190 --> 26:27.570]  Well, because I was reading it and then I realized it was flipped over and I couldn't read what it said.
[26:29.730 --> 26:30.370]  That'll happen.
[26:30.550 --> 26:31.430]  I'm not...
[26:32.310 --> 26:33.330]  I'm not getting any younger.
[26:34.970 --> 26:35.290]  Mentally.
[26:35.710 --> 26:37.850]  Yeah, I can see well, I just can't process what I see.
[26:38.910 --> 26:39.550]  Joey Pets.
[26:40.810 --> 26:42.090]  That might have been...
[26:42.090 --> 26:42.490]  Pit Boy Pirates.
[26:42.630 --> 26:42.970]  Oh, cute!
[26:42.990 --> 26:43.710]  Boston Red Sox.
[26:43.730 --> 26:44.670]  What are these?
[26:44.810 --> 26:45.990]  These are, like, little...
[26:45.990 --> 26:46.110]  Oh!
[26:47.010 --> 26:48.050]  That's how you can...
[26:48.050 --> 26:48.870]  That's cool!
[26:49.210 --> 26:50.010]  Yeah, these are big deal ones.
[26:50.050 --> 26:51.230]  Nicholas, you want that one? The Pirates?
[26:51.310 --> 26:51.830]  Oh, that's cool.
[26:51.950 --> 26:53.750]  Nicholas wants the Pirates.
[26:53.750 --> 26:56.310]  I like him because the other picture never quite goes all the way away.
[26:56.810 --> 26:57.890]  Uh, this looks like...
[26:58.310 --> 26:58.830]  Oh, Tim Raines.
[26:59.530 --> 26:59.910]  Oh!
[27:01.310 --> 27:03.750]  Is that an up-and-down one? Top-to-bottom one?
[27:03.810 --> 27:04.670]  Is it his ghost?
[27:05.010 --> 27:05.270]  Exactly.
[27:05.730 --> 27:07.710]  It's the ghost of Tim Raines!
[27:09.070 --> 27:11.030]  He's got, like, his own flashback built in.
[27:11.250 --> 27:12.090]  It looks like...
[27:12.090 --> 27:17.190]  It looks like a high school yearbook photo for athletes where it's, like, superimposed.
[27:17.890 --> 27:19.950]  Oh, Scott Geraltz.
[27:20.930 --> 27:21.490]  Look at that.
[27:21.490 --> 27:22.310]  What's the other hologram?
[27:23.170 --> 27:24.370]  Oh, it's him throwing.
[27:24.770 --> 27:25.490]  Look out!
[27:26.550 --> 27:27.450]  It's coming for you!
[27:28.570 --> 27:29.270]  80 miles an hour.
[27:29.510 --> 27:29.630]  I'm sorry.
[27:29.870 --> 27:30.230]  No.
[27:31.770 --> 27:32.090]  Easy.
[27:33.110 --> 27:33.470]  Easy?
[27:33.690 --> 27:34.730]  Oh, and Darryl Evans.
[27:34.870 --> 27:35.250]  There we go.
[27:35.390 --> 27:36.350]  And it's, uh...
[27:37.490 --> 27:37.850]  Gonna...
[27:37.850 --> 27:38.230]  Oh, that's cool.
[27:38.250 --> 27:39.070]  Hit a thousand balls!
[27:39.490 --> 27:39.810]  Gonna...
[27:39.810 --> 27:40.830]  Hit a thousand balls!
[27:41.310 --> 27:42.470]  Let's not get too crazy.
[27:43.510 --> 27:45.010]  I like that mine were, like, magic tricks.
[27:45.210 --> 27:45.670]  They were!
[27:45.870 --> 27:46.510]  Yeah, that's true.
[27:46.630 --> 27:46.930]  Yeah, they were good.
[27:46.930 --> 27:47.370]  Very unique.
[27:48.050 --> 27:50.850]  We're gonna go a little heavier on the pack sack because I don't feel like we gave it enough love.
[27:50.930 --> 27:51.330]  No, I like it.
[27:51.330 --> 27:52.090]  Is this yours?
[27:52.330 --> 27:52.890]  This is...
[27:52.890 --> 27:54.610]  This is just...
[27:54.610 --> 27:55.510]  All of ours.
[27:55.690 --> 27:56.610]  This one's for Matt Bragg.
[27:56.750 --> 27:58.010]  This is Matt Bragg's.
[27:58.550 --> 27:59.710]  We're pouring it out for Matt Bragg.
[28:00.010 --> 28:01.170]  He can't hear a word we're saying.
[28:01.770 --> 28:02.130]  Uh...
[28:02.130 --> 28:02.670]  No, he can.
[28:02.810 --> 28:03.810]  He just really doesn't care.
[28:04.410 --> 28:04.770]  19...
[28:05.790 --> 28:06.150]  19...
[28:06.150 --> 28:07.510]  I know him very well.
[28:07.770 --> 28:09.270]  He's heard everything that's been said.
[28:09.710 --> 28:10.950]  That's a great shot!
[28:11.310 --> 28:12.710]  Nicholas, that's a great shot of Matt Bragg.
[28:14.830 --> 28:15.850]  Super fan, Matt!
[28:16.230 --> 28:17.930]  First round of traffic, Dan Wilson.
[28:18.010 --> 28:18.550]  Oh, my God.
[28:18.550 --> 28:19.310]  That'll work out for him.
[28:19.310 --> 28:21.150]  Randy Varas, I guess.
[28:21.930 --> 28:22.570]  Geoff Blauser.
[28:22.770 --> 28:24.250]  Get out of here, Chris Hoyles.
[28:24.470 --> 28:25.470]  Get back in there, Chris Hoyles.
[28:25.930 --> 28:26.570]  Devin White.
[28:26.730 --> 28:27.510]  Oh, look at that shit!
[28:27.590 --> 28:28.050]  Kyle Ripken.
[28:28.190 --> 28:29.070]  That's a hit, actually.
[28:29.230 --> 28:29.890]  A little bit of money there.
[28:31.010 --> 28:31.650]  Kelly Downs.
[28:33.210 --> 28:34.610]  Craig Biggio for the Astros.
[28:34.930 --> 28:36.050]  There's a Hall of Famer right there.
[28:36.990 --> 28:37.630]  Geoffrey Leonard.
[28:37.830 --> 28:40.310]  I always felt bad for Craig Biggio because...
[28:41.710 --> 28:42.250]  What's his face?
[28:42.290 --> 28:42.610]  The other one.
[28:42.670 --> 28:43.010]  Geoff Bagwell.
[28:43.010 --> 28:43.990]  Geoff Bagwell at the same time.
[28:44.090 --> 28:44.170]  Yep.
[28:46.650 --> 28:47.290]  Calvin Schiraldi.
[28:47.670 --> 28:48.470]  Don't remember him.
[28:48.470 --> 28:50.470]  Mike Pagliarulo.
[28:51.930 --> 28:53.250]  Whoa, that's a...
[28:53.250 --> 28:54.410]  Scott Erickson.
[28:55.730 --> 28:56.610]  Vaughn Hayes.
[28:56.870 --> 28:57.770]  Vaughn Hayes is a cool name.
[28:57.930 --> 28:58.690]  That's a great baseball name.
[28:58.750 --> 28:59.590]  Sweet Lou Whittaker.
[28:59.770 --> 29:00.330]  Look at that throw.
[29:00.550 --> 29:00.830]  That's cool.
[29:01.370 --> 29:03.430]  And Lance Johnson.
[29:03.790 --> 29:06.030]  Not to be confused with Lance Bass, who doesn't play professional baseball.
[29:06.130 --> 29:07.810]  And is a totally different person.
[29:07.930 --> 29:11.570]  But was a guest host on this season's Bachelor in Paradise for two episodes.
[29:11.910 --> 29:12.050]  Yeah.
[29:12.250 --> 29:13.670]  And did an okay job.
[29:14.770 --> 29:15.130]  What?
[29:17.430 --> 29:18.950]  You really did pick up on that pretty fast.
[29:19.190 --> 29:20.190]  Doing great with that.
[29:20.270 --> 29:20.430]  Yep.
[29:20.630 --> 29:23.410]  Let's open up something different that's not in the pack sack.
[29:23.530 --> 29:25.130]  Can it not be Umbrella Academy, please?
[29:25.990 --> 29:27.370]  I love how much you love Umbrella Academy.
[29:27.370 --> 29:28.470]  That is the worst.
[29:28.610 --> 29:29.010]  I think that...
[29:29.010 --> 29:29.370]  What the fuck?
[29:29.550 --> 29:32.550]  Umbrella Academy, I think, has to be the worst stuff that we've opened.
[29:32.570 --> 29:33.190]  Your least favorite.
[29:33.310 --> 29:34.350]  They are... it's terrible.
[29:34.550 --> 29:37.210]  There's a guy with giant arms and I just don't get it.
[29:37.210 --> 29:37.450]  Gorilla.
[29:37.650 --> 29:38.590]  You don't like the monkey guy?
[29:38.890 --> 29:39.250]  No.
[29:39.770 --> 29:40.650]  Monkey guy was great.
[29:40.770 --> 29:42.310]  Baseball, hangar pack, series one.
[29:42.450 --> 29:42.690]  2021.
[29:44.830 --> 29:45.390]  What happened?
[29:45.550 --> 29:45.990]  What was that?
[29:46.290 --> 29:47.070]  We're just cutting it open.
[29:47.390 --> 29:47.590]  Oh.
[29:47.870 --> 29:48.250]  The plastic.
[29:49.210 --> 29:50.850]  Maybe we should try one from...
[29:52.230 --> 29:54.470]  One Twin Peaks and one Bond as well to see if we get...
[29:54.470 --> 29:56.190]  Oh yeah, we can finish those boxes off.
[29:56.190 --> 29:56.930]  Yeah, we get some benches.
[29:58.510 --> 30:02.070]  We were talking about this show is way too long at two hours, so we have tons of time to kill.
[30:03.430 --> 30:06.670]  All future Fuckface Break Shits are gonna be 90 minutes going forward, we've decided.
[30:06.730 --> 30:07.850]  I'll let you know when they're gonna be, though.
[30:07.930 --> 30:08.990]  Have we ever done one that short?
[30:09.390 --> 30:10.850]  Well, the first one was supposed to be an hour.
[30:10.850 --> 30:13.090]  But then we just kept extending the time.
[30:14.030 --> 30:14.670]  We just kept going.
[30:14.850 --> 30:16.410]  No, we're just gonna keep going.
[30:16.610 --> 30:17.810]  I guess the RTX one was an hour.
[30:18.350 --> 30:19.590]  Yeah, that's true.
[30:19.730 --> 30:21.010]  That was during penalties and everything.
[30:21.150 --> 30:21.810]  That was pretty fast.
[30:22.010 --> 30:23.150]  Yeah, two hours is a little too much.
[30:23.170 --> 30:24.110]  Penalties were about 55 minutes of it.
[30:25.250 --> 30:27.350]  Two hours is a little long to keep this bit going.
[30:29.290 --> 30:30.650]  All right, let's see what cards we get.
[30:30.650 --> 30:31.110]  Here we go.
[30:31.250 --> 30:33.030]  This is top 2021, series one, baseball.
[30:33.230 --> 30:33.450]  Let's do it.
[30:33.450 --> 30:34.230]  I got some series two as well.
[30:34.290 --> 30:34.990]  Colin Morin.
[30:36.690 --> 30:37.330]  Kinta Medea.
[30:38.670 --> 30:39.310]  Omar Narvaez.
[30:39.370 --> 30:40.510]  I'm just getting back into baseball now.
[30:42.170 --> 30:42.490]  Junior.
[30:43.090 --> 30:45.030]  If I destroy somebody's name, Eric, you can fix it.
[30:45.090 --> 30:45.530]  Yeah, you got it.
[30:46.670 --> 30:47.310]  Orlando Arcea.
[30:47.790 --> 30:48.970]  Evan White, rookie card.
[30:49.090 --> 30:49.950]  That'll be a hit.
[30:50.370 --> 30:51.010]  I don't know about that.
[30:51.290 --> 30:52.790]  Well, I mean, it's...
[30:52.790 --> 30:53.730]  I got a sleeve all over my face.
[30:53.730 --> 30:55.750]  He looks terrified that he hit the ball.
[30:56.250 --> 30:57.110]  Go back to that card.
[30:57.230 --> 30:59.830]  He does not look comfortable at all, but he's made contact.
[31:03.530 --> 31:04.490]  Good eye, Andrew.
[31:04.630 --> 31:05.270]  That is a great one.
[31:05.990 --> 31:06.310]  Here's...
[31:06.310 --> 31:07.090]  I've never heard of this dude.
[31:07.930 --> 31:08.570]  Jesse Winker.
[31:09.150 --> 31:09.970]  Are you serious?
[31:09.970 --> 31:10.690]  That is a photo.
[31:10.970 --> 31:11.710]  You should...
[31:11.710 --> 31:13.050]  That's Jesse Winker.
[31:13.430 --> 31:14.970]  I don't follow the Cincinnati Reds.
[31:15.190 --> 31:15.870]  He had a season.
[31:16.150 --> 31:16.350]  Yeah?
[31:16.510 --> 31:16.750]  Yeah.
[31:16.950 --> 31:18.430]  Did it end up with the Reds in the playoffs?
[31:18.610 --> 31:19.290]  I think it did.
[31:19.470 --> 31:20.250]  I think it's on his face.
[31:20.870 --> 31:21.230]  A beard?
[31:21.710 --> 31:22.410]  The other thing.
[31:23.490 --> 31:23.850]  Eyes?
[31:24.210 --> 31:24.430]  Teeth?
[31:24.530 --> 31:24.750]  Nose?
[31:25.070 --> 31:25.370]  Hat?
[31:26.010 --> 31:27.390]  Are you talking about this guy right here?
[31:27.550 --> 31:27.750]  Yeah.
[31:28.050 --> 31:30.630]  That is a guard so he doesn't get hit in the jaw with a baseball.
[31:30.850 --> 31:31.990]  Like when he's batting.
[31:32.050 --> 31:33.510]  I've only ever seen him on the air a bit.
[31:33.650 --> 31:34.710]  I didn't realize they come down.
[31:34.710 --> 31:39.130]  They have them go further now because people are pitching high and tight and sometimes you get...
[31:39.130 --> 31:42.650]  It probably means he's probably wearing it because he got hit.
[31:42.850 --> 31:42.970]  Yeah.
[31:43.250 --> 31:43.510]  Right.
[31:43.750 --> 31:43.930]  Yeah.
[31:44.290 --> 31:45.090]  So is he left-handed?
[31:48.230 --> 31:48.850]  Right-handed.
[31:49.290 --> 31:49.650]  Right-handed.
[31:50.070 --> 31:50.390]  Left-handed.
[31:50.590 --> 31:50.790]  He bats left.
[31:51.050 --> 31:51.830]  He's a left-handed.
[31:52.150 --> 31:52.970]  Good call, Gavin.
[31:53.450 --> 31:54.290]  How'd you do that?
[31:54.810 --> 31:56.950]  I looked at the thing on the right side of his head.
[31:56.950 --> 31:58.150]  Luis Garcia rookie.
[31:58.510 --> 32:02.130]  Listen, I worked with people at Mega64 who still have to go left.
[32:03.490 --> 32:04.370]  To make the L?
[32:04.450 --> 32:04.650]  Yeah.
[32:05.110 --> 32:06.150]  So we're smarter than them.
[32:06.230 --> 32:07.650]  Oh, I'll give you that.
[32:08.130 --> 32:08.810]  That's good to know.
[32:08.950 --> 32:09.830]  I was suspecting.
[32:09.830 --> 32:10.090]  Yeah.
[32:12.770 --> 32:13.410]  Carter Kaboom.
[32:15.210 --> 32:15.850]  Evan Longoria.
[32:16.890 --> 32:17.210]  Not...
[32:18.190 --> 32:19.030]  You may think it.
[32:19.090 --> 32:19.690]  You may get it confused.
[32:19.830 --> 32:22.570]  Evan Longoria was never married to Tony Parker.
[32:23.090 --> 32:23.730]  That was Eva Longoria.
[32:24.350 --> 32:24.790]  They're different.
[32:24.790 --> 32:25.530]  Totally different people.
[32:25.630 --> 32:26.850]  He's having a little bit of a bounce back season.
[32:26.990 --> 32:27.150]  That's nice.
[32:27.210 --> 32:27.990]  The Giants are looking good this season.
[32:27.990 --> 32:30.290]  I mean, you can't fucking lose if you're on the Giants right now.
[32:30.330 --> 32:30.750]  Yeah, no kidding.
[32:31.610 --> 32:32.250]  Miles Mikolas.
[32:32.370 --> 32:33.850]  Not to be confused with Miles Morales.
[32:34.310 --> 32:34.630]  Spider-Man.
[32:34.650 --> 32:35.370]  Look at...
[32:35.370 --> 32:35.970]  Is he a pitcher?
[32:36.510 --> 32:36.810]  Yes.
[32:36.890 --> 32:37.690]  Yes, he appears to be pitching.
[32:38.290 --> 32:39.930]  What is your pitching face, Geoff?
[32:40.030 --> 32:41.110]  Oh, that's good.
[32:41.250 --> 32:41.870]  Like, he's grimacing.
[32:42.470 --> 32:43.470]  Like, he has a very distinct...
[32:43.470 --> 32:44.430]  Do you have a pitching face?
[32:44.590 --> 32:46.730]  I think my pitching face will be stern and confident.
[32:47.330 --> 32:47.690]  Okay.
[32:47.870 --> 32:47.970]  You know?
[32:48.450 --> 32:49.510]  Like piercing eyes.
[32:49.790 --> 32:52.530]  This one's interesting because it looks like he's sitting on his own name.
[32:53.110 --> 32:55.530]  He does look like he's sitting on his name.
[32:55.590 --> 32:56.170]  Have a seat.
[32:56.950 --> 32:58.550]  We should call this one Have a Seat.
[32:58.650 --> 32:59.090]  There you go.
[32:59.410 --> 33:01.250]  Almost every card's a hit when it's fuckface.
[33:01.330 --> 33:01.590]  I love it.
[33:01.650 --> 33:01.870]  That's a good one.
[33:02.350 --> 33:03.190]  J.D. Martinez.
[33:03.730 --> 33:04.670]  That's the whole point of this.
[33:04.710 --> 33:05.270]  To show the fun.
[33:05.350 --> 33:07.090]  I feel like we're all looking out for different stuff.
[33:07.090 --> 33:08.170]  Cody Whitley.
[33:08.310 --> 33:10.010]  That's why we make this perfect group.
[33:10.050 --> 33:10.750]  How you doing over there, Emily?
[33:10.870 --> 33:11.210]  You having a good time?
[33:11.250 --> 33:11.630]  I'm doing great.
[33:11.730 --> 33:16.450]  I was actually thinking, do you think when you do your pitching that you will do...
[33:16.450 --> 33:17.510]  There's so many different styles.
[33:17.690 --> 33:17.790]  Yes.
[33:17.790 --> 33:19.690]  Do you think that you'll do a leg kick?
[33:19.810 --> 33:23.110]  Do you think you'll do these where they kind of really squat down?
[33:23.430 --> 33:25.910]  Well, I have two pitching styles.
[33:26.050 --> 33:26.290]  Okay.
[33:26.950 --> 33:30.710]  And I'm not sure which one will provide the most velocity, so I will be attempting both.
[33:30.790 --> 33:33.250]  Are you like a wind-up guy and then you have one from, like, the stretch?
[33:33.350 --> 33:33.510]  Usually.
[33:33.610 --> 33:34.150]  Okay, cool.
[33:34.190 --> 33:35.090]  Let's go to the wide shot.
[33:36.390 --> 33:38.550]  Are you going to kind of like...
[33:38.550 --> 33:38.870]  No!
[33:39.770 --> 33:40.050]  No!
[33:42.150 --> 33:42.930]  All right, here we go.
[33:43.090 --> 33:43.330]  Right.
[33:43.970 --> 33:44.790]  I'm on the mound, right?
[33:44.830 --> 33:45.530]  Okay, right.
[33:45.910 --> 33:46.630]  Is this good shot for me?
[33:46.670 --> 33:47.670]  Yeah, no, no, you're good.
[33:47.790 --> 33:48.830]  No, no, you're good.
[33:48.950 --> 33:49.650]  Yeah, no, you're doing great.
[33:50.250 --> 33:51.670]  Okay, you're throwing to Matt Bragg.
[33:51.970 --> 33:52.610]  I'm throwing to Matt Bragg.
[33:52.670 --> 33:54.450]  My first pitch, like, my natural...
[33:54.450 --> 33:55.150]  Okay, so you're from...
[33:55.150 --> 33:55.670]  I don't even think about it.
[33:55.710 --> 33:56.810]  My natural pitching stance is...
[33:56.810 --> 33:56.970]  Right.
[33:57.010 --> 33:58.510]  I kick back out to the right a little bit, right?
[33:58.610 --> 33:58.890]  Uh-huh.
[33:58.910 --> 33:59.190]  Okay.
[33:59.270 --> 34:02.130]  And then I do a full, like, full wind-up.
[34:02.390 --> 34:02.650]  Woo!
[34:02.790 --> 34:03.290]  High kick.
[34:04.890 --> 34:05.410]  Follows over.
[34:05.510 --> 34:05.790]  Okay.
[34:05.990 --> 34:07.250]  Got to be careful when you follow over.
[34:07.510 --> 34:08.290]  Uh-huh.
[34:09.610 --> 34:10.410]  Got to be careful with that.
[34:10.490 --> 34:11.210]  You don't want to follow too much,
[34:11.270 --> 34:11.670]  but you got to follow.
[34:11.930 --> 34:13.750]  But I'm also considering...
[34:13.750 --> 34:14.590]  Looks like he's going to bat.
[34:15.290 --> 34:15.930]  ...only coming...
[34:15.930 --> 34:16.970]  keeping it tight.
[34:17.490 --> 34:17.790]  Uh-huh.
[34:17.950 --> 34:19.350]  I think I might get more velocity that way.
[34:19.410 --> 34:19.790]  I don't know.
[34:19.810 --> 34:21.030]  So you're going to use the second one?
[34:21.810 --> 34:22.290]  I'm going to try both.
[34:22.510 --> 34:23.570]  Oh, wait, the difference is?
[34:23.710 --> 34:23.950]  Uh-huh.
[34:24.190 --> 34:24.570]  The arm.
[34:25.370 --> 34:25.930]  The kick.
[34:26.150 --> 34:26.930]  Going back?
[34:27.310 --> 34:28.110]  Yeah, the arm and the kick.
[34:28.670 --> 34:28.890]  Woo!
[34:29.950 --> 34:30.270]  Woo!
[34:30.850 --> 34:32.630]  This is all, like, all of that stuff is
[34:32.630 --> 34:33.610]  before you've throwed it.
[34:33.810 --> 34:34.170]  Yeah.
[34:39.030 --> 34:40.630]  She'll throw it, but it's the same.
[34:41.090 --> 34:41.670]  Eric gets it.
[34:41.750 --> 34:42.170]  I got it.
[34:42.350 --> 34:44.250]  But do you think that you're going to do that,
[34:44.490 --> 34:45.070]  that, like...
[34:45.070 --> 34:45.770]  You think he'll submarine it?
[34:45.770 --> 34:46.690]  ...that sidearm thing?
[34:46.750 --> 34:48.570]  Like, are you going to need that surgery, you know?
[34:48.670 --> 34:49.730]  Yeah, you're going to need Tommy John.
[34:49.870 --> 34:51.030]  Yeah, I think after you pitch,
[34:51.070 --> 34:52.010]  you're going to need Tommy John.
[34:53.010 --> 34:54.090]  And then people are going to go,
[34:54.430 --> 34:55.390]  Rooster Teeth was different.
[34:55.510 --> 34:57.430]  Geoff just never bounced back from that Tommy John.
[35:02.100 --> 35:04.040]  No, I'm hoping I don't need Tommy John surgery.
[35:04.040 --> 35:06.800]  And I will not be throwing sidearm, although I can,
[35:06.900 --> 35:08.720]  but I think that that would be hard to get speed.
[35:08.880 --> 35:09.820]  Emily, if you could do me a favor
[35:09.820 --> 35:10.900]  and ask him all those questions
[35:10.900 --> 35:12.660]  when he's about to go out and pitch
[35:12.660 --> 35:14.200]  so he can really overthink it.
[35:14.380 --> 35:15.340]  Just get out there and say,
[35:15.420 --> 35:16.200]  are you kicking...
[35:16.200 --> 35:17.260]  How high does your leg go?
[35:17.360 --> 35:18.040]  And you go...
[35:19.120 --> 35:20.180]  Oh, shut up.
[35:20.260 --> 35:21.400]  You guys, I'm unflappable.
[35:21.660 --> 35:23.500]  You will not be able to...
[35:23.500 --> 35:25.000]  Mike Kostromski, not be...
[35:25.000 --> 35:25.640]  Did he say he's unflappable?
[35:26.100 --> 35:26.420]  ...unflappable.
[35:26.680 --> 35:26.760]  Okay.
[35:27.020 --> 35:27.820]  I heard unflappable.
[35:28.380 --> 35:29.560]  He's trying to jack me off.
[35:29.640 --> 35:30.620]  You cannot do it.
[35:31.780 --> 35:32.420]  It's impossible.
[35:34.940 --> 35:36.160]  Jesus Sanchez, rookie.
[35:36.600 --> 35:37.580]  That's on Marlon's card.
[35:37.640 --> 35:38.100]  Oh, my God.
[35:38.420 --> 35:40.340]  He seems like he's in pain in that photo.
[35:41.360 --> 35:42.000]  Yeah, he's...
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.280]  But it's because he hit the ball so far.
[35:43.660 --> 35:44.300]  It's probably because
[35:44.300 --> 35:45.600]  somebody threw the ball 80 miles an hour.
[35:45.700 --> 35:46.240]  He's like, fuck.
[35:46.780 --> 35:47.320]  And you missed it.
[35:47.420 --> 35:47.880]  I'm sorry.
[35:48.020 --> 35:49.560]  You think somebody threw 80 miles an hour
[35:49.560 --> 35:50.620]  and he went, oh, no?
[35:50.940 --> 35:51.940]  Yeah, he was like, oh.
[35:53.000 --> 35:53.320]  Off...
[35:53.320 --> 35:53.860]  Change up, huh?
[35:53.880 --> 35:55.300]  It's the low end of off speed.
[35:55.840 --> 35:56.280]  I know.
[35:57.020 --> 35:57.660]  Patrick Corbin.
[35:58.920 --> 35:59.560]  Tony Kemp.
[35:59.720 --> 36:00.780]  Looks like he's about to trip.
[36:01.060 --> 36:01.560]  Yes, he does.
[36:01.560 --> 36:02.040]  Look at his feet right there.
[36:02.180 --> 36:02.780]  That's a good one.
[36:02.780 --> 36:06.360]  He's tripping over his name.
[36:06.600 --> 36:07.380]  Oh, my God.
[36:07.600 --> 36:08.820]  We have a whole series of cards
[36:08.820 --> 36:10.380]  of people just being affected by the card.
[36:11.380 --> 36:12.160]  That's amazing.
[36:12.640 --> 36:14.080]  Who's the card currently displayed?
[36:14.240 --> 36:14.720]  What's his name?
[36:15.760 --> 36:16.200]  Patrick.
[36:16.260 --> 36:17.660]  That's Patrick Corbin right now.
[36:17.740 --> 36:18.240]  This is Patrick Corbin.
[36:18.780 --> 36:19.960]  Do you think you'd be pissed
[36:19.960 --> 36:21.000]  if you're Patrick Corbin
[36:21.000 --> 36:22.480]  that, like, you've done nothing,
[36:22.580 --> 36:23.440]  so that's your shot?
[36:23.500 --> 36:24.680]  Like, he's not doing an action.
[36:24.780 --> 36:25.320]  He's walking.
[36:25.580 --> 36:26.680]  My fucking baseball card
[36:26.680 --> 36:28.140]  is me taking the field.
[36:28.300 --> 36:30.580]  Especially if he only plays one year
[36:30.580 --> 36:31.020]  and that's it.
[36:31.020 --> 36:31.700]  That's as good as it gets.
[36:31.700 --> 36:32.800]  Patrick Corbin.
[36:32.920 --> 36:33.580]  Not to be confused
[36:33.580 --> 36:34.400]  with Corbin Bernson.
[36:35.960 --> 36:37.380]  Corbin Bernson played third base
[36:37.380 --> 36:38.520]  in Major League,
[36:38.560 --> 36:40.640]  so I think I would not get confused.
[36:41.620 --> 36:42.540]  That's an excellent point.
[36:42.960 --> 36:43.660]  Jay Bruce.
[36:43.780 --> 36:45.140]  Oh, that's an action shot.
[36:45.160 --> 36:46.760]  It looks like he's kicking his name.
[36:46.860 --> 36:47.400]  He's kicking his name.
[36:47.940 --> 36:51.060]  Oh, man.
[36:51.140 --> 36:51.680]  This is going to take forever.
[36:51.680 --> 36:52.540]  This is a good pull.
[36:52.880 --> 36:53.900]  Eric Sogard.
[36:54.480 --> 36:55.040]  Never heard of him.
[36:55.400 --> 36:56.980]  He plays with glasses.
[36:57.320 --> 36:57.540]  Yeah.
[36:57.860 --> 36:59.200]  Malik Smith.
[36:59.660 --> 37:01.140]  Look at him with his mask on.
[37:01.140 --> 37:02.640]  Practicing safety.
[37:02.740 --> 37:03.120]  That's cool.
[37:04.300 --> 37:05.740]  He's quite far from other players.
[37:06.040 --> 37:07.300]  Yeah, he's in the outfield,
[37:07.440 --> 37:08.540]  so you don't get much further.
[37:09.140 --> 37:09.700]  That's true.
[37:09.960 --> 37:10.560]  It's as far as...
[37:10.560 --> 37:11.420]  It's as far as...
[37:11.420 --> 37:12.700]  I mean, he's catching a ball.
[37:12.920 --> 37:13.800]  He's probably close to the bullpen, though.
[37:13.820 --> 37:14.540]  And you know those pitchers.
[37:14.640 --> 37:15.360]  Yeah, they're gross.
[37:15.640 --> 37:16.380]  They're weird little monsters.
[37:16.660 --> 37:16.820]  Yeah.
[37:17.940 --> 37:18.660]  Brandon Crawford.
[37:19.380 --> 37:19.740]  Looking...
[37:19.740 --> 37:21.080]  I hate Brandon Crawford.
[37:21.480 --> 37:21.660]  Why?
[37:22.740 --> 37:23.100]  He's...
[37:23.100 --> 37:23.560]  Hate?
[37:23.600 --> 37:24.180]  He's good.
[37:24.280 --> 37:25.680]  Yeah, he's in the same division.
[37:26.180 --> 37:26.560]  He's very...
[37:26.560 --> 37:27.200]  He's good.
[37:28.260 --> 37:29.420]  When I play with him in MLB,
[37:29.460 --> 37:30.280]  the show I can't hit.
[37:30.280 --> 37:31.300]  I hate you, Brandon Crawford.
[37:31.500 --> 37:32.500]  You're watching this?
[37:32.540 --> 37:33.060]  I'll get you.
[37:33.440 --> 37:34.660]  Ryan Booby Holder.
[37:35.000 --> 37:35.820]  Booby Holder?
[37:36.420 --> 37:36.940]  Brazier.
[37:37.020 --> 37:37.320]  Brazier.
[37:38.820 --> 37:39.720]  Sorry, Ryan Titcup.
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.600]  I mean, I really got so excited.
[37:43.240 --> 37:44.780]  Oh, my God.
[37:45.140 --> 37:47.100]  This is maybe the best card we've ever had.
[37:47.240 --> 37:47.700]  What?
[37:48.380 --> 37:49.200]  Nolan Arenado.
[37:49.660 --> 37:52.080]  Looks like he's being hung by his own card.
[37:52.460 --> 37:55.300]  I cannot believe they let that get made.
[37:55.520 --> 37:56.540]  He's being...
[37:57.160 --> 37:59.820]  He's being strung up by his own baseball card.
[37:59.820 --> 38:01.020]  He's like...
[38:02.020 --> 38:03.320]  That's an amazing one.
[38:03.360 --> 38:04.100]  That's a very good one.
[38:04.140 --> 38:05.300]  That is phenomenal.
[38:05.720 --> 38:05.940]  Oh, boy.
[38:06.880 --> 38:07.240]  Phenomenal.
[38:07.440 --> 38:11.040]  Is there a rule, like, are you not allowed to throw the ball really slow?
[38:11.420 --> 38:13.840]  Like, what if you did throw the ball at, like, 42 miles an hour?
[38:13.900 --> 38:14.380]  You can.
[38:14.480 --> 38:16.320]  There's a guy named Zach Grenke who does it.
[38:16.420 --> 38:17.700]  They call it an Ephus pitch.
[38:18.160 --> 38:19.900]  It's just, he'll throw it in there.
[38:19.960 --> 38:20.940]  He's a weird pitcher.
[38:21.080 --> 38:21.640]  He's awesome.
[38:21.680 --> 38:22.820]  I mean, what's the lower limit, though?
[38:23.020 --> 38:24.620]  Like, where does the ball not make it?
[38:24.660 --> 38:25.280]  But that's the thing.
[38:25.360 --> 38:28.960]  Like, it won't pick up on the radar gun if they throw it too slow.
[38:28.960 --> 38:35.780]  And he was having a competition with another pitcher on the Brewers to see who could throw the slowest pitch.
[38:36.220 --> 38:39.380]  And Zach Grenke did it, and it was, like, 48 or something.
[38:39.620 --> 38:40.460]  It was just...
[38:40.460 --> 38:44.420]  I mean, it's like, you know, if you were throwing across the room...
[38:44.860 --> 38:46.420]  It's just, he just went...
[38:46.420 --> 38:49.300]  And he lobbed it, and it just went...
[38:49.300 --> 38:52.900]  And it went right in, and the guy, the batter just watched it, and it was a strike.
[38:53.600 --> 38:53.960]  Wow.
[38:54.720 --> 38:56.140]  That's the slowest strike in history.
[38:56.180 --> 38:56.700]  He's awesome.
[38:56.860 --> 38:57.600]  Paul Goldschmidt.
[38:59.100 --> 39:01.180]  Oh, here's an Atlanta Braves team card.
[39:01.640 --> 39:02.400]  That's interesting.
[39:02.780 --> 39:03.740]  I don't know who that is.
[39:04.040 --> 39:04.920]  Dansby Swanson.
[39:05.260 --> 39:05.620]  Dansby Swanson.
[39:06.160 --> 39:08.440]  That's my favorite baseball name right now.
[39:09.120 --> 39:09.360]  Dansby.
[39:09.720 --> 39:10.860]  Dansby Swanson.
[39:11.160 --> 39:11.400]  Great.
[39:11.620 --> 39:13.600]  It gets stuck in my head like a song.
[39:13.700 --> 39:14.880]  He looks like that guy from Heroes.
[39:17.520 --> 39:18.640]  I don't know which guy.
[39:20.360 --> 39:21.440]  I know who you're talking about.
[39:21.560 --> 39:22.080]  Hayden Penetere.
[39:22.220 --> 39:22.500]  From Rocky.
[39:24.200 --> 39:25.000]  Wait, wait, wait.
[39:26.280 --> 39:27.240]  The Rocky guy.
[39:27.680 --> 39:28.300]  Rocky's kid.
[39:28.660 --> 39:29.400]  Rocky's kid, yeah.
[39:30.360 --> 39:30.720]  Milo...
[39:31.240 --> 39:31.600]  Milo...
[39:31.600 --> 39:33.940]  The guy that burned up today trying to save a dog.
[39:34.120 --> 39:34.520]  Yeah, that guy.
[39:34.800 --> 39:35.980]  The guy who...
[39:35.980 --> 39:39.000]  That's the dude from This Is Us, right?
[39:39.120 --> 39:41.860]  Mandy Moore's husband who died saving his family from a fire or whatever.
[39:42.560 --> 39:45.360]  That's the dude who my daughter used to watch that show, and she said,
[39:45.460 --> 39:46.620]  I wish you were more like him.
[39:47.560 --> 39:48.980]  And I go, you want me to die?
[39:49.340 --> 39:51.260]  And she's like, no, but look what he does for his family.
[39:51.320 --> 39:52.700]  And I'm like, what do I not do for you?
[39:52.700 --> 39:53.980]  And she's like, no, you're great.
[39:54.080 --> 39:56.200]  You're a great dad, but he's like a really great dad.
[39:56.420 --> 39:57.520]  You'd run into a fire?
[39:57.680 --> 39:57.780]  Yeah.
[39:58.260 --> 39:59.400]  That guy sets up on fire.
[39:59.500 --> 40:00.160]  I'll do it right now.
[40:00.220 --> 40:01.160]  That guy was on Gilmore Girls.
[40:01.500 --> 40:02.040]  Yeah, he was.
[40:02.480 --> 40:03.980]  A lot of people were on Gilmore Girls.
[40:04.060 --> 40:05.440]  I think he was Rory's best boyfriend.
[40:05.440 --> 40:06.520]  Did he break Rory's heart?
[40:07.120 --> 40:08.640]  Yeah, Jesse had to leave.
[40:08.840 --> 40:11.540]  Colorado Rockies practicing their safety as well.
[40:12.020 --> 40:13.940]  Brett Gardner looking pretty fucking cool.
[40:14.200 --> 40:15.940]  His head gets bigger every season.
[40:16.360 --> 40:17.040]  This guy looks like a cop.
[40:17.420 --> 40:18.600]  He just looks like a cop.
[40:18.840 --> 40:19.740]  Because of his head?
[40:20.020 --> 40:21.560]  I mean, his whole everything about him.
[40:21.560 --> 40:23.560]  It's like those pursed lips.
[40:23.700 --> 40:25.080]  We'll have a Secret Narcs.
[40:25.860 --> 40:27.760]  Dude, I'm all about that one.
[40:27.820 --> 40:28.340]  That's a good one.
[40:28.420 --> 40:29.500]  Secret Narcs is a good one.
[40:29.540 --> 40:30.600]  I love all of our categories.
[40:31.220 --> 40:31.900]  Austin Meadows.
[40:33.200 --> 40:33.800]  All right.
[40:34.360 --> 40:36.220]  Are you deliberately showing none of these the right way up?
[40:36.480 --> 40:37.140]  Billy Gariel.
[40:37.720 --> 40:39.280]  Ooh, that's a good one.
[40:39.320 --> 40:40.740]  He looks like he has a tail.
[40:41.340 --> 40:42.100]  He's really, really concentrating.
[40:42.300 --> 40:43.400]  It does look like he has a little...
[40:43.400 --> 40:44.500]  It looks like he has a little butt.
[40:45.260 --> 40:46.480]  He's getting his tails up.
[40:46.580 --> 40:47.320]  Guys that may be animals.
[40:47.700 --> 40:48.820]  It's like the beginning of his mating.
[40:49.100 --> 40:50.040]  Paul Goldschmidt.
[40:50.040 --> 40:51.540]  Home run bullshit card.
[40:51.580 --> 40:52.380]  I'm so glad he's out.
[40:52.380 --> 40:52.920]  Oh, man.
[40:53.020 --> 40:54.860]  The numbered card is...
[40:54.860 --> 40:56.460]  Well, I guess it's cool because it's a White Sox.
[40:56.620 --> 40:57.500]  Hey, do it for the fans.
[40:57.760 --> 40:59.160]  There's no fans in that picture.
[40:59.380 --> 41:00.480]  Do it for the cutouts.
[41:00.620 --> 41:01.500]  It says do it for the fans.
[41:01.580 --> 41:02.520]  Do it for the cutouts.
[41:03.140 --> 41:04.160]  Because there's cutouts.
[41:04.720 --> 41:05.660]  It's in on the joke.
[41:06.260 --> 41:09.420]  And then if you flip it over, you can see this one is a numbered card.
[41:09.460 --> 41:11.040]  Number 856 of 2021.
[41:11.820 --> 41:12.780]  That card sucks.
[41:12.960 --> 41:13.680]  You know why it's 2021?
[41:14.600 --> 41:15.600]  It's the year.
[41:15.860 --> 41:16.240]  That's why.
[41:16.880 --> 41:17.900]  You cracked the code.
[41:18.080 --> 41:18.940]  J.D. Martinez.
[41:18.940 --> 41:20.640]  Is that a signed J.D. Martinez?
[41:20.940 --> 41:24.680]  No, it's like one of those retro cards.
[41:24.900 --> 41:25.260]  Got it.
[41:25.680 --> 41:26.560]  There's Mike Trout.
[41:27.080 --> 41:27.840]  Everybody loves Mike Trout.
[41:28.140 --> 41:28.520]  Blake Snell.
[41:29.220 --> 41:32.640]  Geoff compared himself to Mike Trout to me earlier today.
[41:32.980 --> 41:33.320]  Yeah, I did.
[41:33.780 --> 41:34.680]  I used up the comparison.
[41:34.960 --> 41:35.060]  Yeah.
[41:35.460 --> 41:38.280]  I mean, I understood what you were going for.
[41:38.420 --> 41:38.580]  Yeah.
[41:39.040 --> 41:39.740]  Miguel Cabrera.
[41:39.900 --> 41:40.200]  Okay.
[41:40.840 --> 41:41.660]  Josh Bell.
[41:42.140 --> 41:44.420]  That's 86 retro, I think.
[41:45.140 --> 41:46.280]  Oh, there's another Mike Trout.
[41:46.420 --> 41:47.040]  Platinum player.
[41:47.040 --> 41:47.860]  Once again.
[41:47.860 --> 41:49.800]  What happened to the card?
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.860]  Oh, this one's like for top 70th anniversary.
[41:52.240 --> 41:53.960]  So you can see it's a 70.
[41:54.560 --> 41:56.140]  Can you hang it off the edge of the table?
[41:56.760 --> 41:58.620]  Yeah, it also counts as a parking pass.
[41:59.380 --> 42:02.560]  But like this is like, can you like hang it?
[42:03.100 --> 42:03.280]  Yeah.
[42:03.600 --> 42:04.560]  Can you hang it from the rim?
[42:05.000 --> 42:05.360]  Oh, yeah.
[42:05.400 --> 42:06.040]  Put it on the rim.
[42:08.780 --> 42:09.660]  Is it going to work?
[42:10.040 --> 42:10.260]  No.
[42:11.720 --> 42:12.560]  Oh, no.
[42:13.260 --> 42:13.540]  Damn it.
[42:14.200 --> 42:14.620]  Sorry, Mike.
[42:15.940 --> 42:17.820]  Sorry, best baseball player in the world.
[42:18.800 --> 42:19.360]  All right.
[42:19.400 --> 42:20.880]  Those are all hits.
[42:21.160 --> 42:21.780]  Get these out of the way.
[42:21.860 --> 42:23.080]  We're still going from this fucking pack.
[42:23.220 --> 42:23.880]  I like this pack.
[42:24.040 --> 42:25.560]  We've had some good stuff come out of it.
[42:27.060 --> 42:27.860]  Leody Tavares.
[42:28.080 --> 42:28.340]  Oh.
[42:28.700 --> 42:30.760]  Looks like he's about to be stabbed by his own bat.
[42:31.360 --> 42:32.700]  Somebody threw that at him.
[42:32.900 --> 42:35.000]  Yeah, someone behind him threw it and it came through.
[42:37.480 --> 42:38.940]  Mike Minor, I guess.
[42:39.980 --> 42:41.440]  That's a great pitching face.
[42:41.520 --> 42:41.920]  That's you.
[42:41.980 --> 42:43.220]  Look at that pitching face.
[42:43.500 --> 42:43.840]  That's you.
[42:43.840 --> 42:45.060]  Are those your stern eyes?
[42:45.280 --> 42:46.080]  Those are good pitching faces.
[42:46.320 --> 42:46.360]  Maybe.
[42:46.540 --> 42:46.780]  The pain.
[42:50.060 --> 42:50.980]  Here's a good pitching face.
[42:51.040 --> 42:51.740]  This is Walker Bueller.
[42:52.140 --> 42:54.480]  He looks very serene.
[42:54.640 --> 42:54.760]  Yep.
[42:55.040 --> 42:56.040]  He's very like, hmm.
[42:57.100 --> 42:57.820]  Having a good day.
[42:58.300 --> 42:58.880]  Oh, look at that.
[42:58.920 --> 42:59.480]  Mookie Betts.
[42:59.680 --> 43:00.680]  You love Walker Bueller.
[43:00.780 --> 43:01.720]  You love Mookie Betts, right?
[43:01.780 --> 43:02.680]  You're a big Dodgers fan.
[43:02.740 --> 43:04.860]  I hate the Dodgers, but I do like Mookie Betts.
[43:04.860 --> 43:05.660]  How do you not like Mookie Betts?
[43:05.660 --> 43:07.000]  Mookie Betts has a great baseball name.
[43:07.100 --> 43:07.920]  He's a great baseball player.
[43:07.920 --> 43:08.900]  One of the best of all time.
[43:08.940 --> 43:09.080]  Yeah.
[43:09.140 --> 43:09.720]  He's also a great player.
[43:11.920 --> 43:12.640]  Paul Dijon.
[43:14.600 --> 43:15.480]  Caleb Smith.
[43:16.040 --> 43:16.880]  D-backs.
[43:18.080 --> 43:18.960]  Luke Weaver.
[43:19.420 --> 43:20.020]  More of them.
[43:21.640 --> 43:22.520]  Kevin Kiermeier.
[43:23.440 --> 43:28.100]  That guy's cool because he just goes to other parts of the outfield and steals the ball from the other outfield players.
[43:28.640 --> 43:29.840]  He's like, I got it.
[43:30.040 --> 43:30.840]  It's so cool.
[43:31.300 --> 43:32.280]  Marco Gonzalez.
[43:33.580 --> 43:34.460]  Wilson Ramos.
[43:34.600 --> 43:39.480]  I used to have a pair of British Knights that was the exact same color scheme.
[43:39.660 --> 43:40.300]  That orange and blue.
[43:40.420 --> 43:40.600]  Really?
[43:40.660 --> 43:41.300]  They were so fucking cool.
[43:42.440 --> 43:43.200]  In high school.
[43:43.300 --> 43:44.140]  Big Mets head or what?
[43:44.400 --> 43:44.840]  Adam Plutko.
[43:44.940 --> 43:45.940]  No, they were just cool shoes.
[43:47.340 --> 43:48.140]  Gio Gonzalez.
[43:49.780 --> 43:50.580]  Wilson Contreras.
[43:52.180 --> 43:52.980]  Mitch Moreland.
[43:53.520 --> 43:54.400]  There's a Padre for you.
[43:54.560 --> 43:55.160]  Yeah, not anymore.
[43:55.760 --> 43:56.560]  Mike Trout.
[43:58.020 --> 43:59.020]  Where'd Mitch Moreland go?
[43:59.140 --> 44:02.240]  He came from the A's and then he went back to the A's I think because he's fucking terrible.
[44:02.540 --> 44:03.080]  Shane Bieber.
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.020]  No relation to my friend Shane from high school.
[44:07.500 --> 44:09.020]  I thought you were going to say Justin Bieber.
[44:09.240 --> 44:10.220]  It was Shane from high school.
[44:10.220 --> 44:11.640]  Yeah, Shane from high school.
[44:11.700 --> 44:12.260]  That's pretty cool.
[44:12.720 --> 44:13.880]  That's an excellent start.
[44:13.900 --> 44:14.460]  That's a good kick.
[44:14.460 --> 44:15.200]  That's a good stance.
[44:15.600 --> 44:19.460]  I mean like how do you finish with a leg kick that's high like that's insane.
[44:19.940 --> 44:21.560]  Yeah, that's a rubber stance. That's a good one.
[44:22.740 --> 44:24.220]  Here's Luke Voight.
[44:24.800 --> 44:25.060]  Huge.
[44:25.600 --> 44:26.260]  His little nose.
[44:26.920 --> 44:28.120]  Look at his little wrists.
[44:28.420 --> 44:29.260]  Look at his little nose.
[44:29.500 --> 44:34.760]  He looks like those people on that British sitcom where everybody had like the big nose.
[44:34.780 --> 44:36.640]  Oh, the guy from Great British Bake Off, isn't he from?
[44:36.640 --> 44:37.300]  The League of Gentlemen?
[44:37.480 --> 44:38.360]  League of Gentlemen, is that it?
[44:38.580 --> 44:39.640]  Where all the noses are pushed up?
[44:39.640 --> 44:39.900]  Yeah.
[44:40.260 --> 44:40.900]  Downton Abbey?
[44:41.040 --> 44:42.040]  He looks like...
[44:44.420 --> 44:46.160]  No, they just hold their noses up high.
[44:46.160 --> 44:46.420]  Oh, okay.
[44:46.600 --> 44:47.820]  I guess that's why I thought that.
[44:48.780 --> 44:50.360]  Oh, Josh Reddick.
[44:53.820 --> 44:54.920]  You can just read it.
[44:55.120 --> 44:55.960]  Broussard, Gretel.
[45:02.820 --> 45:04.340]  Just keep the flow going.
[45:04.620 --> 45:05.620]  That's Broussard.
[45:05.620 --> 45:06.200]  Monte Harrison.
[45:06.360 --> 45:06.540]  It's fine.
[45:06.720 --> 45:07.100]  It doesn't matter.
[45:07.880 --> 45:09.080]  There's Joey Bart, rookie.
[45:09.080 --> 45:09.860]  That's cute.
[45:09.980 --> 45:10.580]  Look at that guy.
[45:11.020 --> 45:11.340]  Nice.
[45:14.920 --> 45:15.720]  Dylan Carlson.
[45:17.140 --> 45:18.260]  You hung on to that one, huh?
[45:18.500 --> 45:19.320]  What was good about that one?
[45:19.420 --> 45:19.840]  Oh, I don't know.
[45:20.060 --> 45:20.860]  I just...
[45:20.860 --> 45:21.340]  It's a rookie.
[45:21.780 --> 45:22.640]  All rookies get it.
[45:23.980 --> 45:24.780]  Brandon Beliak.
[45:26.440 --> 45:28.320]  That guy looked like Spencer from Survivor.
[45:28.600 --> 45:29.540]  Michael Lorenzen.
[45:30.800 --> 45:31.100]  Oh.
[45:31.260 --> 45:32.100]  Yeah, he does, actually.
[45:32.320 --> 45:33.500]  He's a very long person.
[45:33.620 --> 45:34.140]  Tim Anderson.
[45:34.440 --> 45:36.480]  I think probably one of the more underrated players in baseball.
[45:37.460 --> 45:38.140]  He's fucking phenomenal.
[45:38.140 --> 45:38.560]  Yeah.
[45:38.700 --> 45:39.920]  Didn't he hit that...
[45:39.920 --> 45:40.780]  Tremendous homerun.
[45:40.920 --> 45:44.160]  Didn't he hit the homerun at the Yankees game that was like the Field of Dreams?
[45:44.280 --> 45:44.380]  Yeah.
[45:44.540 --> 45:45.260]  He fucking crushed that thing.
[45:45.500 --> 45:45.840]  That was sick.
[45:46.180 --> 45:46.760]  Hit it in the corner.
[45:46.760 --> 45:47.380]  That was a great game.
[45:47.640 --> 45:48.280]  Jose Quintana.
[45:48.460 --> 45:50.280]  They're doing it next year with the Mets and the Reds, I think.
[45:50.280 --> 45:50.460]  Yeah.
[45:50.620 --> 45:50.740]  Yeah.
[45:52.800 --> 45:53.400]  Brian Goodwin.
[45:54.680 --> 45:55.280]  Trevor Bauer.
[45:56.700 --> 45:57.840]  You should throw that one away.
[45:59.100 --> 45:59.920]  It's that one's...
[45:59.920 --> 46:01.240]  You don't even want to have that one.
[46:01.240 --> 46:01.880]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[46:01.980 --> 46:03.140]  He's not...
[46:03.140 --> 46:03.520]  I don't think...
[46:03.520 --> 46:04.880]  I also don't think he's coming back.
[46:04.980 --> 46:06.300]  He probably won't make it back to baseball.
[46:07.120 --> 46:09.300]  And then Amir Garrett doing the...
[46:10.140 --> 46:13.740]  Oh, is this before or after he gets in a fight with the Cubs every time he goes out and pitches?
[46:14.120 --> 46:14.340]  That's funny.
[46:14.560 --> 46:14.980]  I don't know.
[46:15.100 --> 46:15.900]  Amir Garrett pitches.
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.380]  He fights with the Cubs all the time.
[46:18.600 --> 46:19.240]  Why does he...
[46:19.240 --> 46:20.120]  Why just the Cubs?
[46:20.200 --> 46:24.600]  Because they're in the same division and he just talks shit and then everyone on the Cubs goes,
[46:24.720 --> 46:25.100]  Fuck you!
[46:25.140 --> 46:25.960]  And then they all want to fight.
[46:26.060 --> 46:26.460]  It's awesome.
[46:27.020 --> 46:27.720]  That's baseball.
[46:28.000 --> 46:28.640]  I love that.
[46:29.380 --> 46:30.140]  Oh, we're doing great time.
[46:30.260 --> 46:30.460]  Okay.
[46:30.940 --> 46:31.740]  All these treasures.
[46:31.760 --> 46:32.620]  I don't think we were worried about it.
[46:33.120 --> 46:33.880]  We've already got here.
[46:34.140 --> 46:34.420]  What's that?
[46:34.420 --> 46:35.900]  I said, I don't think we were worried about the time.
[46:36.720 --> 46:37.240]  All right.
[46:37.300 --> 46:37.800]  I think we're good.
[46:38.520 --> 46:41.840]  We'll crack into this box of crap that I have here.
[46:41.840 --> 46:42.420]  What is that?
[46:42.680 --> 46:43.300]  Just some amoeba?
[46:43.460 --> 46:44.980]  What is going on?
[46:45.060 --> 46:46.260]  I got a bunch of different stuff in here.
[46:47.080 --> 46:48.120]  What the fuck?
[46:48.400 --> 46:48.720]  First.
[46:48.820 --> 46:50.860]  Is that what you thought was going to be in there when he opened that?
[46:50.880 --> 46:51.200]  No.
[46:51.760 --> 46:53.880]  Now I want to see if anyone can come to my island.
[46:54.020 --> 46:54.840]  This is insane.
[46:54.940 --> 46:55.500]  Yeah, we'll get there.
[46:56.300 --> 46:58.220]  Here's Topps Baseball Series 2.
[46:58.480 --> 46:58.880]  So we did that.
[46:58.880 --> 46:59.620]  That was Series 1.
[46:59.860 --> 47:00.920]  Now we'll do Series 2.
[47:01.020 --> 47:02.080]  These are the high number cards.
[47:02.520 --> 47:03.000]  What does that mean?
[47:03.000 --> 47:06.980]  It's like there'll be a lot of mid-season rookies and stuff.
[47:12.290 --> 47:12.730]  Okay.
[47:13.450 --> 47:15.490]  We got trades, that kind of stuff.
[47:15.570 --> 47:16.710]  Dalton Geoffries, rookie.
[47:17.310 --> 47:18.470]  That's a good card.
[47:19.530 --> 47:20.390]  Probably not, actually.
[47:20.490 --> 47:21.310]  Taylor Widener, rookie.
[47:22.030 --> 47:22.990]  Luis Garcia again.
[47:22.990 --> 47:23.410]  I thought about it.
[47:23.870 --> 47:24.630]  Jordan Weems.
[47:24.630 --> 47:26.710]  Those are all rookies that will probably never amount to anything.
[47:28.190 --> 47:29.870]  I'm thinking in terms of money.
[47:31.250 --> 47:32.130]  Yandy Diaz.
[47:33.690 --> 47:34.630]  Gross, Jack.
[47:36.270 --> 47:37.070]  Nick Castellanos.
[47:38.690 --> 47:39.490]  Jordan Hicks.
[47:39.550 --> 47:40.490]  Wait, who is that card for?
[47:41.470 --> 47:42.290]  I think for him.
[47:42.550 --> 47:43.390]  Yeah, that is him.
[47:43.430 --> 47:45.430]  Because the other guy's name is Suarez, as you can see.
[47:46.610 --> 47:48.310]  Also, it would have been his back.
[47:49.270 --> 47:51.410]  It's his card for the guy who's back.
[47:52.150 --> 47:52.690]  All right.
[47:53.210 --> 47:55.450]  Here's Alex Colome, I guess.
[47:55.550 --> 47:55.930]  Or Colome.
[47:56.150 --> 47:57.390]  Looks like he's cursing God.
[47:57.870 --> 47:58.810]  He's like, what?
[47:59.390 --> 48:00.050]  Damn you!
[48:00.750 --> 48:01.450]  Yeah, he is.
[48:01.510 --> 48:02.010]  He's like that.
[48:02.330 --> 48:03.890]  He looks like...
[48:03.890 --> 48:05.230]  He doesn't want to play baseball.
[48:05.230 --> 48:06.330]  It's like his punishment.
[48:07.570 --> 48:09.650]  It's like Sisyphus.
[48:13.730 --> 48:14.830]  He's like, who is it?
[48:16.250 --> 48:17.090]  Who's that guy?
[48:17.150 --> 48:18.310]  He played the Green Goblin.
[48:19.630 --> 48:20.150]  Willem?
[48:20.270 --> 48:21.370]  Yeah, Willem Dafoe.
[48:21.470 --> 48:22.870]  He looks like Willem Dafoe at the end of Platoon.
[48:26.050 --> 48:27.090]  Adam Wainwright.
[48:27.430 --> 48:27.970]  All right.
[48:28.510 --> 48:29.410]  J.D. Martinez.
[48:29.690 --> 48:30.190]  Retro card.
[48:30.290 --> 48:30.790]  I like that.
[48:33.190 --> 48:34.170]  Aaron Nola.
[48:36.630 --> 48:37.270]  Austin Hedges.
[48:37.510 --> 48:38.650]  That's a big mask.
[48:39.150 --> 48:40.050]  That is a big mask.
[48:41.370 --> 48:42.490]  It looks like...
[48:43.170 --> 48:45.050]  You know how when you roll up on a construction site,
[48:45.190 --> 48:46.290]  after they've torn a building down,
[48:46.590 --> 48:48.470]  and there's a bunch of rebar and a pile of concrete?
[48:48.610 --> 48:49.310]  It looks kind of like that.
[48:51.050 --> 48:51.690]  Derek Dietrich.
[48:51.910 --> 48:52.630]  He's very excited.
[48:53.550 --> 48:54.910]  Why is he punching himself in the head?
[48:57.170 --> 48:57.810]  Fucking stupid!
[48:58.210 --> 48:59.350]  Just double cut out and stop hitting yourself.
[48:59.450 --> 49:00.370]  It's fucking stupid!
[49:01.990 --> 49:02.630]  He's like...
[49:03.070 --> 49:03.930]  It's like in Boogie Nights.
[49:03.930 --> 49:04.810]  It's fucking stupid!
[49:06.670 --> 49:07.970]  And Jose Altuve.
[49:09.090 --> 49:10.290]  Man, these fucking...
[49:10.290 --> 49:13.110]  That's a rare baseball in the shot.
[49:13.730 --> 49:15.890]  I was just thinking that all these cards...
[49:16.490 --> 49:18.970]  It's always the moment happened or is about to.
[49:19.270 --> 49:20.490]  We never actually see the moment.
[49:20.610 --> 49:21.210]  That was a good caption.
[49:21.270 --> 49:22.590]  Andrew, you have such a good eye for this.
[49:22.630 --> 49:23.290]  That's a great eye, Andrew.
[49:23.290 --> 49:24.190]  That's the stuff that...
[49:24.190 --> 49:26.470]  You're seeing things I don't even clock, man.
[49:27.110 --> 49:29.390]  I was just thinking that the baseball cards are weird
[49:29.390 --> 49:31.790]  because I feel like you never see the moment they're intended.
[49:31.790 --> 49:36.610]  It's always right after the thing that's awesome or right before it.
[49:36.690 --> 49:38.490]  We're pretty sports heavy this far.
[49:38.570 --> 49:38.970]  Pretty solely...
[49:39.910 --> 49:42.010]  Well, I guess we did have Batman and wrestling.
[49:42.330 --> 49:43.170]  But a lot of baseball.
[49:43.670 --> 49:45.010]  1988, good year.
[49:45.090 --> 49:49.070]  1988 was a good year for Don Zimmer cards, I believe.
[49:49.270 --> 49:51.730]  So let's see if we...
[49:56.940 --> 49:58.040]  Mark Sullivan.
[49:59.700 --> 50:01.040]  Old helmets look weird.
[50:01.160 --> 50:01.540]  Yeah, they do.
[50:01.760 --> 50:02.240]  That's a helmet?
[50:02.240 --> 50:03.280]  I thought it was a hat.
[50:03.540 --> 50:04.200]  No, it's a helmet.
[50:06.080 --> 50:06.820]  That's a...
[50:07.420 --> 50:08.120]  Checklist card.
[50:08.320 --> 50:10.540]  Yeah, for numbers 133 to 364.
[50:12.780 --> 50:13.580]  Gene Garber.
[50:16.300 --> 50:18.280]  That's a stance I could see you taking, Geoff.
[50:18.540 --> 50:18.900]  Was that?
[50:19.100 --> 50:19.400]  Yeah.
[50:19.500 --> 50:20.400]  The previous one?
[50:20.500 --> 50:22.620]  I feel like that'll be what you look like when you throw the ball.
[50:22.620 --> 50:23.840]  Yeah, like almost falling over.
[50:26.440 --> 50:27.240]  Tracy Jones.
[50:27.320 --> 50:28.300]  That's a colorful card.
[50:29.380 --> 50:30.180]  Brad Havens.
[50:31.340 --> 50:32.220]  Alan Anderson.
[50:33.840 --> 50:34.720]  Andre Thomas.
[50:35.260 --> 50:36.700]  Is that Alan spelled with two L's?
[50:36.700 --> 50:37.140]  He's so scared.
[50:37.400 --> 50:40.360]  What is he running from?
[50:40.460 --> 50:41.900]  Is that Alan spelled with two L's?
[50:42.060 --> 50:44.780]  I don't feel like I see an A-L-L-A.
[50:45.220 --> 50:49.580]  We're going to pull all the Alons that we pull from here on out.
[50:50.560 --> 50:51.440]  Domingo Ramos.
[50:52.940 --> 50:54.920]  Kind of got like an A-Rod look about him there.
[50:56.200 --> 50:57.340]  Oh, Ozzy Smith.
[50:57.540 --> 50:58.340]  All right, the wizard.
[50:58.440 --> 50:59.440]  Ozzy Smith, the wizard.
[50:59.440 --> 51:00.480]  That guy can flip.
[51:01.840 --> 51:02.800]  Rod Booker.
[51:03.500 --> 51:04.780]  Roger Craig manager card.
[51:04.880 --> 51:07.040]  All manager cards are hits, so we'll put that aside.
[51:07.200 --> 51:09.060]  That's a wise-looking individual right there.
[51:10.040 --> 51:10.920]  Oh, look at that!
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.680]  Tom Glavine rookie, I believe.
[51:13.660 --> 51:14.400]  That's unfortunate.
[51:14.540 --> 51:16.060]  Or maybe second-year card.
[51:16.680 --> 51:18.640]  Is it braces or that's just his teeth?
[51:19.440 --> 51:21.200]  He's 14 in the cards though, yeah.
[51:21.280 --> 51:22.880]  It's very much a high school yearbook vibe.
[51:24.040 --> 51:24.760]  Teddy Higuera.
[51:28.340 --> 51:29.300]  Doug DeCensus.
[51:29.440 --> 51:31.600]  I guess this is how they would tell you if a player got traded.
[51:32.020 --> 51:33.040]  Now with cardinals.
[51:34.300 --> 51:35.360]  Great little fanfare.
[51:37.740 --> 51:38.540]  That sucks!
[51:41.060 --> 51:41.780]  That's pretty good.
[51:41.880 --> 51:42.620]  That was a pretty good pack.
[51:42.760 --> 51:44.700]  Okay, so let's mix it up a little bit.
[51:45.220 --> 51:48.960]  I bought these initially for Gus, but I don't know when we'll ever see him.
[51:49.380 --> 51:52.040]  So, next we'll open up Sailor Moon.
[51:52.740 --> 51:56.360]  These are the Sailor Moon archival trading cards.
[51:56.520 --> 51:56.920]  Wow.
[51:56.920 --> 51:59.820]  Six cards per pack. Collect all 72 cards.
[52:00.200 --> 52:03.040]  And the randomly inserted nine collectible game chase cards.
[52:03.100 --> 52:04.580]  That's what we want. We want those chase cards.
[52:04.680 --> 52:05.660]  Those seem like a lot of cards.
[52:06.240 --> 52:08.160]  Especially for the number of episodes that she probably had.
[52:08.300 --> 52:09.180]  Probably more than 72.
[52:09.520 --> 52:12.080]  Well, I just watched the live action and that one had like 70 episodes.
[52:12.080 --> 52:12.620]  Who's your favorite?
[52:13.220 --> 52:13.620]  Sailor.
[52:13.680 --> 52:14.600]  Sailor Jupiter. Duh.
[52:15.640 --> 52:15.980]  Okay.
[52:16.660 --> 52:19.580]  I just typed how into Google and the first thing that came up is,
[52:19.700 --> 52:20.620]  how old is Britney Spears?
[52:21.960 --> 52:24.440]  Well, she's in the news right now.
[52:24.680 --> 52:26.040]  Finally got free from her father.
[52:26.040 --> 52:26.580]  Crazy.
[52:27.820 --> 52:28.700]  Free Britney.
[52:29.020 --> 52:31.400]  Free from her father. Still needs to get out of the conservatorship.
[52:31.840 --> 52:32.800]  One step closer.
[52:33.180 --> 52:36.120]  How many episodes of Sailor Moon?
[52:36.700 --> 52:37.600]  Let's see if I can name them all.
[52:38.120 --> 52:41.900]  There's Sailor Jupiter. I think that's Tuxedo Mask.
[52:42.700 --> 52:45.940]  Is that Sailor Mars?
[52:46.660 --> 52:48.180]  And then that's Sailor Moon, I guess.
[52:50.280 --> 52:50.720]  Mercury.
[52:51.320 --> 52:53.180]  Sailor Mercury and Sailor Venus, I believe.
[52:54.040 --> 52:56.860]  And then there's one who's not a sailor or anything, but she's just like them.
[52:56.980 --> 52:57.920]  I can't remember who that is.
[52:58.000 --> 52:59.140]  You know a lot about Sailor Moon.
[52:59.320 --> 53:01.280]  I watched every episode of live action Sailor Moon.
[53:01.360 --> 53:01.960]  I had no idea.
[53:02.380 --> 53:03.800]  I learned so much about you.
[53:03.820 --> 53:04.800]  It was awesome.
[53:05.340 --> 53:06.140]  You didn't watch them?
[53:06.640 --> 53:06.840]  No.
[53:08.920 --> 53:09.640]  There's that.
[53:11.660 --> 53:13.100]  There was a live action Sailor Moon.
[53:13.140 --> 53:15.340]  I was probably dancing to Britney Spears on my TV.
[53:18.580 --> 53:19.300]  There's that.
[53:19.960 --> 53:21.800]  These are less fun without Gus here to narrate.
[53:21.800 --> 53:24.440]  What would Gus say?
[53:24.580 --> 53:24.880]  I don't know.
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.260]  He might remember some Sailor Moon shit.
[53:26.280 --> 53:27.240]  What do they say on the back?
[53:27.520 --> 53:28.060]  That's a great question.
[53:28.120 --> 53:28.580]  What do they say?
[53:28.960 --> 53:29.780]  This is Sailor Moon.
[53:29.940 --> 53:30.880]  These are deadly thorns.
[53:31.880 --> 53:39.040]  Molly falls in love with the evil Nephite and manages to bring out a tenderness in him he even didn't know was possible.
[53:39.840 --> 53:44.520]  Molly is heartbroken when Nephite is killed by the scheming Zoysite.
[53:45.780 --> 53:47.700]  I guess he had a redemption before he died.
[53:48.020 --> 53:50.040]  He's got Wolverine things in his hands, it looks like.
[53:50.040 --> 53:52.540]  I think he's staffed.
[53:52.860 --> 53:54.300]  It's going all the way through.
[53:56.080 --> 54:00.520]  He's showing a softness that he did not even know was there.
[54:00.880 --> 54:02.040]  He just needed to be skewed.
[54:02.360 --> 54:04.240]  Here's the collectible game card.
[54:05.200 --> 54:06.340]  Wow, from the game?
[54:07.480 --> 54:08.600]  Coming in Spring 2000.
[54:09.780 --> 54:14.020]  Can I say just how much I love this little tape frame that someone's done?
[54:14.440 --> 54:14.840]  Isn't it great?
[54:15.080 --> 54:15.720]  It's really good.
[54:19.520 --> 54:20.300]  Here's the thing.
[54:20.640 --> 54:25.300]  If you don't have parameters for Geoff to put the card down in, the camera's never going to get it.
[54:25.360 --> 54:25.880]  No, that's true.
[54:26.700 --> 54:27.320]  I'm brutal.
[54:27.580 --> 54:32.120]  Because we just tried top and bottom, and then he was going way outside.
[54:32.260 --> 54:33.700]  I'm not an attention to detail guy.
[54:34.420 --> 54:35.520]  It was really something.
[54:35.800 --> 54:36.140]  What the?
[54:36.560 --> 54:40.480]  Series 2, Animal Crossing, Amiibo, collect and collect.
[54:42.160 --> 54:43.420]  Who's the monkey?
[54:44.360 --> 54:45.380]  He's a train man.
[54:46.060 --> 54:46.960]  On the left.
[54:47.200 --> 54:47.920]  Who's that?
[54:49.100 --> 54:50.260]  That's a fucking dog.
[54:51.460 --> 54:54.800]  Up, left, left, that's up, left.
[54:55.160 --> 54:56.200]  Oh, there you go.
[54:56.220 --> 54:57.200]  I don't know him.
[55:01.220 --> 55:03.320]  You couldn't fucking find him.
[55:04.300 --> 55:07.880]  Six Amiibo cards and one NPC special card.
[55:08.000 --> 55:08.900]  Alright, let's open this up.
[55:09.460 --> 55:11.480]  Full disclosure, I've opened one of these at home.
[55:11.760 --> 55:12.380]  It was very good.
[55:12.660 --> 55:13.740]  Have you scanned any in?
[55:14.060 --> 55:14.260]  No.
[55:14.260 --> 55:15.420]  Are you going to?
[55:16.220 --> 55:20.680]  I mean, I might invite someone to the old campsite if they're a special one.
[55:20.700 --> 55:21.260]  Very nice.
[55:22.480 --> 55:23.660]  Do you still play Animal Crossing, Gavin?
[55:23.780 --> 55:24.100]  Nah.
[55:25.200 --> 55:25.940]  But, you know, I would.
[55:26.180 --> 55:26.780]  Yeah, same.
[55:27.040 --> 55:27.820]  It's fun to pick up.
[55:28.580 --> 55:31.060]  Are they like QR codes that you scan in or what is it?
[55:31.160 --> 55:32.100]  I think they're just NFC.
[55:32.380 --> 55:32.480]  Yeah.
[55:33.300 --> 55:33.940]  Oh, okay.
[55:34.300 --> 55:34.620]  Pango!
[55:35.360 --> 55:35.680]  Wow!
[55:35.980 --> 55:37.240]  Is that a...
[55:37.240 --> 55:37.620]  Anteater?
[55:37.900 --> 55:38.220]  Anteater.
[55:38.440 --> 55:39.320]  Do you think we'll get a Hornsby?
[55:39.760 --> 55:41.260]  If we get a Hornsby, I'm going to flip.
[55:41.340 --> 55:41.720]  That's a hit.
[55:41.760 --> 55:42.940]  I'm going to flip my shit if we get a Hornsby.
[55:42.940 --> 55:43.680]  What's a Hornsby?
[55:44.160 --> 55:44.840]  Oh, go ahead.
[55:46.180 --> 55:46.580]  You can go.
[55:46.900 --> 55:47.080]  No.
[55:47.640 --> 55:48.440]  After you, I'm sorry.
[55:48.600 --> 55:48.980]  No, I don't know.
[55:49.000 --> 55:49.600]  Hornsby is your favorite.
[55:50.060 --> 55:54.920]  Hornsby is who, if I even thought about letting leave the island, Geoff would cry.
[55:55.880 --> 55:57.820]  Okay, so is he like a rhino?
[55:57.900 --> 55:59.680]  Hornsby, Snake, and Flo are who I care.
[55:59.800 --> 56:00.960]  Is Hornsby a rhino?
[56:01.100 --> 56:04.280]  Hornsby is a rhino and he likes snacks.
[56:04.520 --> 56:05.120]  Oh, okay.
[56:05.360 --> 56:05.920]  That's cool.
[56:05.980 --> 56:06.760]  We have similar hobbies.
[56:06.860 --> 56:07.240]  That's fun.
[56:08.240 --> 56:08.960]  Here's Agnes.
[56:09.520 --> 56:10.020]  That's my middle name.
[56:10.240 --> 56:10.880]  I like her style.
[56:11.020 --> 56:11.980]  It is your middle name, that's true.
[56:11.980 --> 56:13.140]  And here's Gabby.
[56:14.020 --> 56:14.460]  Yuck.
[56:14.820 --> 56:15.640]  I'm with Gavin.
[56:16.720 --> 56:19.560]  Gavin, tell me how you feel about all these sponsors that show up.
[56:19.860 --> 56:20.180]  Jesus.
[56:20.360 --> 56:20.820]  This is cool.
[56:22.120 --> 56:23.300]  Maybe this is Flo Chabot.
[56:23.380 --> 56:23.680]  Avery?
[56:24.140 --> 56:24.720]  Are you into Avery?
[56:25.900 --> 56:26.100]  No?
[56:26.640 --> 56:29.180]  Avery looks like he's going to fucking go nuts.
[56:29.820 --> 56:30.580]  That's cool.
[56:31.120 --> 56:32.080]  Say some shit to him.
[56:33.100 --> 56:33.860]  No, he's fine.
[56:34.140 --> 56:34.780]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[56:35.920 --> 56:37.140]  Fucking Star Fox.
[56:37.360 --> 56:39.300]  It's like Falco's cousin, Avery.
[56:41.180 --> 56:41.800]  Floor o'clock.
[56:41.820 --> 56:42.580]  It's four o'clock.
[56:42.820 --> 56:44.340]  It's time to give the dog his medicine.
[56:45.200 --> 56:47.400]  Have to remember to do that later.
[56:47.760 --> 56:48.820]  I like Vladimir.
[56:49.040 --> 56:50.140]  Vladimir is sinister.
[56:50.380 --> 56:52.300]  Vladimir is plotting on that island.
[56:52.300 --> 56:53.740]  He's fucking clearly Russian.
[56:53.940 --> 56:56.080]  He is going to take down Tom Nook.
[56:57.640 --> 56:58.660]  From the inside.
[56:58.800 --> 56:59.600]  Troll the society.
[56:59.780 --> 57:00.780]  Look at this refractor.
[57:00.780 --> 57:01.220]  Wow.
[57:01.860 --> 57:03.280]  A refractory booker.
[57:03.440 --> 57:03.940]  It's a cop.
[57:04.980 --> 57:05.660]  Don't trust him.
[57:05.720 --> 57:06.280]  It's a hot cop.
[57:06.400 --> 57:06.800]  Look at that.
[57:06.920 --> 57:08.300]  It's the perfect follow-up to Vladimir.
[57:08.300 --> 57:09.640]  He's going to shut that shit down.
[57:09.660 --> 57:09.780]  It's true.
[57:10.100 --> 57:11.620]  Booker and Vladimir are against each other.
[57:11.680 --> 57:12.020]  It's true.
[57:13.840 --> 57:14.560]  Those are cool.
[57:14.680 --> 57:15.120]  Do you have more of those?
[57:15.260 --> 57:15.420]  I do.
[57:15.680 --> 57:16.440]  I have one more.
[57:16.500 --> 57:17.900]  That was series two, I believe.
[57:18.020 --> 57:19.320]  This is series one.
[57:21.460 --> 57:23.040]  They have a lot of raccoons now.
[57:23.260 --> 57:24.320]  There used to just be one raccoon.
[57:25.060 --> 57:26.820]  It's a lot of raccoons in Animal Crossing.
[57:28.060 --> 57:28.960]  Big raccoon game.
[57:35.320 --> 57:36.040]  All right.
[57:36.200 --> 57:36.920]  Here we go.
[57:38.000 --> 57:38.360]  Panchetti.
[57:39.460 --> 57:40.380]  Because she's a pig.
[57:40.380 --> 57:41.540]  Because she's like pancetta?
[57:41.740 --> 57:42.720]  Like that's what a pig does.
[57:43.060 --> 57:43.460]  That's fucked up.
[57:43.460 --> 57:44.640]  You know what pancetta is good for?
[57:45.020 --> 57:45.600]  Tater tots.
[57:46.800 --> 57:47.180]  Eunice.
[57:47.600 --> 57:48.940]  Oh, you mean like as a sauce?
[57:49.060 --> 57:50.840]  I can't believe you would even joke about it.
[57:52.000 --> 57:52.380]  Eunice.
[57:56.520 --> 57:58.700]  She looks like she's got a face up there.
[57:58.960 --> 57:59.740]  Her eyes are so high.
[57:59.760 --> 58:00.800]  That's a sad face.
[58:00.960 --> 58:01.880]  And then there's another face.
[58:01.980 --> 58:03.400]  Well, the nose could also be a mouth.
[58:03.680 --> 58:04.780]  Could be a tooth in the mouth.
[58:05.200 --> 58:06.180]  There's a lot going on.
[58:06.360 --> 58:07.620]  That's a confusing face.
[58:08.740 --> 58:09.120]  Octavian.
[58:09.120 --> 58:09.460]  Octavian.
[58:09.460 --> 58:11.240]  That might be my favorite.
[58:11.900 --> 58:14.620]  Dude, Octavian is not putting up with...
[58:14.620 --> 58:15.460]  He's not suffering it.
[58:15.720 --> 58:16.780]  Where are the other two legs?
[58:18.000 --> 58:18.760]  You don't want to know.
[58:20.120 --> 58:21.060]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[58:21.180 --> 58:21.520]  Leonardo.
[58:21.660 --> 58:22.460]  Who's Leonardo?
[58:22.680 --> 58:23.180]  He's cool.
[58:23.300 --> 58:24.240]  He's fast is what he is.
[58:24.400 --> 58:24.660]  Is he?
[58:24.800 --> 58:25.300]  I couldn't tell.
[58:25.680 --> 58:25.980]  I'm lying.
[58:26.100 --> 58:26.540]  I can tell.
[58:28.120 --> 58:28.700]  This is exciting.
[58:29.200 --> 58:30.080]  And Cap'n.
[58:30.440 --> 58:30.880]  Whoa.
[58:31.880 --> 58:33.440]  What's the name of that kind of turtle?
[58:33.580 --> 58:34.600]  The yokai thing?
[58:36.060 --> 58:38.420]  They got like water that tips out of their fucking head.
[58:38.420 --> 58:38.980]  What?
[58:40.220 --> 58:42.200]  You got a water head turtle?
[58:42.980 --> 58:44.640]  There are turtles that tip water?
[58:44.840 --> 58:45.280]  Yokai. Turtle.
[58:45.740 --> 58:46.660]  They're called something.
[58:46.820 --> 58:47.340]  That's amazing.
[58:47.600 --> 58:48.980]  They're not real turtles.
[58:49.200 --> 58:49.340]  Oh.
[58:49.440 --> 58:50.180]  They're called kappas.
[58:51.020 --> 58:52.240]  I get the name now.
[58:53.180 --> 58:54.300]  Oh, yeah.
[58:54.680 --> 58:55.580]  It's his name.
[58:58.200 --> 58:59.240]  He's a yokai.
[58:59.440 --> 58:59.780]  Look.
[59:00.900 --> 59:02.300]  I got some more Sailor Moon.
[59:02.400 --> 59:03.120]  Let's not open that.
[59:04.740 --> 59:05.300]  Oh my god.
[59:05.480 --> 59:05.720]  Yeah.
[59:06.260 --> 59:07.020]  That's a yokai.
[59:07.020 --> 59:07.620]  It's a yokai.
[59:07.620 --> 59:08.560]  Oh, what is that from?
[59:08.620 --> 59:09.700]  It's a kappa from Japan.
[59:10.320 --> 59:14.160]  But like, is it like a Baba Yaga or something?
[59:14.280 --> 59:14.380]  Yeah.
[59:14.540 --> 59:15.460]  Something to scare kids with?
[59:15.460 --> 59:15.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:16.160 --> 59:16.640]  You don't eat your vegetables?
[59:16.960 --> 59:17.820]  Yokai is like...
[59:17.820 --> 59:19.500]  The frog will tip water on you?
[59:19.560 --> 59:20.280]  Yeah, like a crazy monster.
[59:20.360 --> 59:23.380]  He lives like under a bridge and will eat you or something.
[59:24.080 --> 59:24.680]  I think.
[59:25.000 --> 59:25.760]  He's pretty crazy.
[59:25.840 --> 59:26.780]  We'll do more 88 baseball.
[59:27.200 --> 59:27.420]  Yeah.
[59:28.300 --> 59:29.360]  I bought a bunch of this shit.
[59:29.480 --> 59:31.140]  You think they got Squirtle in that one too or whatever?
[59:31.300 --> 59:32.780]  Yeah, we're gonna look for it.
[59:35.040 --> 59:35.560]  Gerald Perry.
[59:37.220 --> 59:38.260]  Denny Martinez.
[59:40.280 --> 59:41.320]  John Davis.
[59:42.840 --> 59:45.840]  Randy St. Clair sounds like a wrestler and a porn star.
[59:45.980 --> 59:46.840]  Yes, it does.
[59:46.960 --> 59:47.700]  Greg Minton.
[59:48.680 --> 59:49.900]  Oh, that's a great...
[59:49.900 --> 59:50.800]  You're not gonna...
[59:50.800 --> 59:52.440]  That's a time capsule human right there.
[59:53.020 --> 59:53.760]  Why is he...
[59:53.760 --> 59:54.820]  Why is he like...
[59:54.820 --> 59:56.280]  Did he know the picture was being taken?
[59:56.540 --> 59:58.920]  What was he watching that he was disgusted by?
[59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.440]  He looks like Inspector Clueso's stand-in.
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:05.860]  Bob Ojeda.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.260]  Oh shit, John Crook.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:09.080]  Nice.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:09.920]  Nice card.
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.120]  Gotta love John Crook.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.100]  He's a character.
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:14.080]  Yeah.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:14.560]  John Crook.
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:14.980]  Funny guy.
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:15.600]  Funny guy.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:17.380]  Chris Bozzio.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:18.520]  Ooh.

[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.380]  Okay, that might be Geoff Pitching.
[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:21.800]  Yeah.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.480]  It all looks like it's escaping.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:25.540]  Which way is his arm?
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.000]  Yeah.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:30.480]  Is that what causes the Tommy John surgery or is it what you get it for?
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:32.420]  Jesus.
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.300]  Moments before he broke every bone in his body.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:35.540]  Yep.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.000]  Andre Dawson.

[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:42.980]  Bud Black.
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.860]  That might be one of the best names.
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:48.400]  Former Padres manager, current Rockies manager, Bud Black.
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:49.180]  That's a good name.
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:51.320]  Country star on the side.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:52.420]  Terry Pendleton.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.000]  Bud Black.

[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:16.100]  I don't know, like, what to say.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.140]  That's the, uh...

[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.780]  Same deal, different year.
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:27.540]  1991.
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:28.880]  You can see they went...
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.460]  They upped their packaging game.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.120]  This is still pre-Andrew pack.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:39.280]  Yeah, you know what's good about all these packs is regardless of the year, I know the same amount of information about them.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.340]  Is that good?
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:42.420]  Yeah.
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:43.220]  Oh, cool.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:45.660]  1991.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:46.640]  It was a good year.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.540]  I was in 10th grade.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.520]  Gino Petralli yelled at the 40 logo on the top.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:52.840]  No!
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:55.920]  Too long!
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.380]  Carlos Quintana.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.320]  Lee Smith.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.280]  That's what I would look like.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.600]  That's what I would look like.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.380]  Hey, Geoff?
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:05.020]  No.
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.420]  That's what I'm gonna look like.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:08.380]  Might as well...
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:09.300]  Thank you, Emily.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.000]  Might as well...
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.540]  Just photoshop my face right on that.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.680]  Maybe let's not do that.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:15.460]  Yeah, me and Lee Smith.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.080]  There we go.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.560]  I don't understand.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:18.520]  Carlos Quintana.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:21.920]  Did he not know, like, what angle he would be at when he took the photo?
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.560]  Like, it's all back and side profile.
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.660]  That is what we were talking about earlier with that Suarez card.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.000]  This is just the back.
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:28.380]  Yeah, why?
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:29.600]  Just the back.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.460]  There should be someone else and it should be their card.
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:37.420]  Cal Daniels.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:39.080]  Joe...
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.780]  That's another good baseball...
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:42.440]  Yeah, there's a baseball in that one, Andrew.
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:43.500]  A rare baseball card.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:47.460]  Well, not like a... like a rare baseball card.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.520]  Joe Klink.
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:51.340]  Look at all the baseball grass on that card.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.540]  It's a great, great baseball grass card.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.700]  There's a lot of baseball grass.
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:55.660]  Yeah, it looks really nice.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.400]  I'm the baseball bitch.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.740]  Put that in the high grass card.
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:58.760]  What's it called?
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:02:59.720]  High grass content.
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:04.140]  Fucking speaking of famous baseball players, here's Joe Girardi.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.240]  Oh, there you go.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:05.980]  We're American.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.940]  You just have to think of like the dumbest word for it.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:08.520]  Just use that.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.480]  Tino Martinez.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.280]  Oh, wow.
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:12.940]  Mickey Morandini.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.440]  He's like a fucking dork.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.760]  Tom Sherrill.
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.120]  He's got dip.
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:19.940]  Yeah, he does.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:24.080]  Look at his... he packed a fucking lip before this.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:24.500]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.600]  Do they still do that?
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:28.620]  You're not supposed to.
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:33.980]  They do like the little packets or they do like a lot of guys just pack like a lip of like gum.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:34.480]  Yeah.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.320]  Because they just... I think it's just like a have something there thing.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:38.760]  The whole point of big league too.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.140]  Yep.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.740]  Todd Benzinger looking confused.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.140]  The moment he realized he needed glasses.
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:50.780]  Carl Nichols.
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:54.100]  Tom Browning.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.380]  Oof, boy.
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.540]  He's having a bloated day.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:58.660]  He needs a beard.
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:02.020]  I'm a big fan of the guys that try to intimidate in their cards.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.080]  Like the logic of like, I'm going to mean mug.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:08.320]  People are going to be fucking scared in the league when they open this pack of tops.
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.640]  Tom Browning, more like Tom frowning.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.400]  Am I right?
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:12.900]  There you go.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.840]  He said he needs a beard.
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.720]  In need of a beard category.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.180]  In need of a beard.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.540]  There's another dip lip right there.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:20.960]  Jose de Leon.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.440]  We have a hard dippers.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.180]  Mickey Hatcher.
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:25.940]  Another famous player.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.800]  And Mike Heath.
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.640]  Not to be confused with the candy bar.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.980]  What a weird baseball bat pose.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.440]  He's holding a baseball bat like he's rowing a boat.
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:39.060]  Yeah, he's canoeing.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:39.660]  He's in a kayak.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.900]  Yeah, he's kayaking.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:42.980]  All right.
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:43.600]  Good pack.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.560]  Let's open one more 1991 tops pack.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:45.920]  Love it.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:46.240]  Good year.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:47.560]  I'm really...
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.780]  What were you doing in 1991?
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.380]  I was five.
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:51.340]  Not existing.
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:54.780]  So, I was in kindergarten, I guess.
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:59.500]  It was so long ago that all of your parents still liked each other.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.060]  Mine too.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:04.700]  My parents went through the phase of we like each other, we hate each other.
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:05.620]  Okay, we're back now.
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.040]  And it's like, all right.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:09.440]  Alex Cole.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.820]  He's very happy to be there.
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:12.960]  Are those glasses or goggles?
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:13.880]  Those are glasses.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.600]  Those are big ass glasses.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:20.180]  Those are the kind of glasses that if they got hit with a baseball, he would be instantly dead.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.160]  Wow.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.060]  Look at Frank Robinson looking very old.
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.180]  That's the manager right there.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:26.760]  Frank Robinson.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.660]  A bird was just flying by.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.440]  That's not even baseball related.
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:31.120]  It's just Orioles.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.480]  He was at an Orioles game and Orioles flew by and he went, no fucking way.
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.080]  It's a cool looking cloud up there.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.220]  This is going to be a good card.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.360]  You guys are all going to like this.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:38.620]  Okay.
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.240]  Hyping up these cards.
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:40.700]  Yeah, really.
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:41.780]  You're going to...
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:42.500]  You'll see.
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:43.540]  Rick Parker.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.800]  Got a baseball in the card.
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:46.600]  Couldn't care less.
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:47.500]  Very nonplussed.
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.180]  I was looking for...
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:50.040]  I'll be honest.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.960]  As soon as you laid the card down, I was looking for hog.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.120]  Like...
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:55.860]  Oh, yeah.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.340]  There's a little mound.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.200]  Yeah, he's in there.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.140]  Next to the Giants.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:00.600]  Yep.
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:02.740]  Bip Roberts.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:03.300]  Hey!
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:04.600]  All right.
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.840]  That's Padres outfielder Bip Roberts.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.200]  Oh, no.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:08.600]  What'd you do?
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.100]  I don't know.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:10.240]  Uh-oh.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:10.820]  I don't know.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:12.020]  Uh-oh.
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.260]  Signed out of the soundboard.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:13.660]  Yep.
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:14.280]  Nope.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:14.940]  Thank you.
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.120]  I think we should just have a Bip file.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.000]  Can I show you my Bip chaser?
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:20.480]  Yeah.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.440]  If I can ever get...
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.560]  If you can find my Bip card, I want it.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:24.160]  Please.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:24.840]  Yeah, of course.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.400]  This is my Bip Roberts card that I would love.
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:28.560]  Oh, the Bip Roberts.
[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:29.100]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:29.720]  It's a famous card.
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:30.660]  I love that.
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:31.200]  In the sombrero.
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:32.440]  Look at Bip.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:33.360]  Yeah, we can do that.
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.940]  If you can find this Bip, send me this Bip.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.560]  I want this Bip.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.860]  What is Bip short for?
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:39.900]  Bipple.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:40.480]  Bipman.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:41.640]  Bip...
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.940]  Bipple, Bipman, Roberts.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.360]  Yeah, Bipple, Bipman.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.420]  It's weird, because it's his first name and his middle name.
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:48.040]  Yeah, it's strange.
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:49.840]  You don't always see that.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.480]  I'm going to look up what Bip stands for.
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.260]  It's Bip McCorkle Roberts.
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:55.940]  No, he told me about that.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:56.220]  Yeah, I called him.
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:57.340]  McCorkle.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:05.200]  Bip's name is Leon Joseph Roberts.
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.460]  Oh, Bip.
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:10.460]  Labels.
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:11.940]  GavNav.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:12.600]  All right.
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:13.080]  Yeah.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:14.540]  I mean, that's...
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:15.060]  Pete Harnish.
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:15.800]  At least you can see the pops with that one.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.840]  At least it's part of it, yep.
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.260]  Edgar Diaz.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.180]  It looks like the bat's too heavy.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.320]  I'm tired from swinging it a thousand times.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.520]  Oh, that's...
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.600]  Yeah, keep rubbing it.
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:29.460]  See what happens.
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.700]  I don't think it's part of the card.
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:34.960]  I think it's just age.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.080]  Doug Drabeck.
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.140]  Looking like a fucking boss pitcher right there.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.500]  Did he end up playing for the Astros or anything?
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:42.560]  Like, why do I know his name?
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.100]  Doug Drabeck?
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:43.520]  Yeah.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.400]  Well, let's see.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.940]  He began his career in 1986 with the New York Yankees,
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.340]  and then he played for the Pirates until 1990.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:54.640]  And that's about when I lost track of him.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.280]  God, he pitched for them all the time.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.140]  He lived in the woodlands where I grew up.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.520]  That's why I know his name, where people would be like,
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:00.920]  oh, that's Doug Drabeck's house.
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:01.500]  He also...
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.600]  Should we have a group near Emily's neighborhood here?
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.040]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:06.640]  Because he did play for the Astros from 93 to 97.
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:07.340]  There you go.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.260]  Good call, Emily.
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:08.800]  Way to go.
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:09.660]  Oh, boy!
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.540]  I thought that was Andrew.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.160]  And I went, whoa, that's mean.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.860]  They're both coming out of Matt Bragg, so it's hard to tell.
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.280]  Oh, fucking...
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.060]  Fred McGriff.
[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:22.320]  Love Fred McGriff.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.260]  Oh, yeah, the crime dog.
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:24.160]  He was the crime dog.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:24.740]  That's what they called him.
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:25.820]  He was a fucking awesome player.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:26.580]  Love McGriff.
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:30.880]  I don't know what to think about this card.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:31.400]  You all right, bud?
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:32.040]  Zane Smith.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:33.940]  Holy shit.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:35.720]  Holy shit.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:37.880]  Is he taking the lunch order?
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:38.280]  What's he doing?
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:39.420]  Yeah, he's like...
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:40.760]  Yeah, he doesn't play for the team.
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.740]  The P at the bottom doesn't stand for pitcher.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.640]  It's just Pirates.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.420]  They're just putting it there more.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.440]  He's in the Pirates organization.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:51.600]  Yeah, it's like...
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:52.320]  So you guys...
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.000]  You had no mayonnaise.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:53.760]  Okay, got it.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.980]  That's the secretly doing another career.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:01.600]  Yeah, really.
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:02.880]  Tricking everyone.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:04.620]  Pat Warners.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.040]  Sunlighting.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:06.880]  Tim Leary.
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.380]  Not Timothy Leary.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.540]  Unsafe at any speed.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.380]  Xavier Hernandez.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:12.680]  It's underappreciated.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.040]  I like that.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.240]  Timothy Leary didn't write that.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.060]  Kevin Bass.
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:17.900]  And...
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.320]  The most boring card I've ever seen.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.100]  That is...
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.300]  That is just...
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:24.780]  If you Google baseball...
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:25.000]  Yeah.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.720]  There's nothing special about that.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:26.960]  Yep.
[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:28.000]  I agree.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:28.700]  Okay.
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:29.320]  That is the most boring baseball card.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.460]  Do you want to have a least interesting baseball card section?
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.460]  Because at least some of the ones where they're just like doing a dumb pose...
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:36.820]  There's something to like dunk on or whatever.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:37.400]  That is just boring baseball.
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:39.140]  We'll end it with Billy Hatcher.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:41.000]  Oh, is he like practicing the...
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:41.940]  Isn't Billy Hatcher...
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.100]  Something called a weight for the bat?
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:44.420]  Yeah, so you...
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:48.000]  To increase your bat speed, you put the weight on it.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.300]  You swing a few times...
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:49.440]  And then it's lighter.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.320]  And then you take it off.
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.840]  And it feels lighter, so you swing it faster.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:53.340]  Right.
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.920]  Wasn't Billy Hatcher the name of a GameCube game?
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:56.940]  Or no?
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.000]  I wasn't a big GameCube guy.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.400]  Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:03.560]  That was a game?
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:04.020]  Yes.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.000]  Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg?
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.460]  Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg.
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:09.120]  Oh.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.940]  Oh, nothing to do with it.
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:11.800]  No.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.900]  So, yeah, but we're big into egg content.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:14.940]  Oh, wait, hang on.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:15.380]  Now that we...
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:19.180]  Did you think I meant Billy Hatcher from the Cincinnati Reds?
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.260]  I thought you had a baseball game.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.140]  But it's really just a chicken with an egg.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:24.700]  Well, it comes chilling, right?
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:25.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.340]  Like Ken Griffey Jr.'s baseball, but it's Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:35.820]  I'm going to run through the last two packages since we still have them.
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:36.920]  Darnell Coles.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:37.200]  Okay.
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.660]  That's a pretty nice card.
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:40.000]  Uh-huh.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.380]  Looking pretty awesome there.
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:44.780]  Oh, Bob Roberts, Rogers, Bob Rogers.
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:46.240]  I don't know how I read that wrong.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.340]  Manager card.
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:47.940]  Poor Expos.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:48.820]  Rick Sutcliffe.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:49.280]  Oh!
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:50.560]  Sut!
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.740]  That's a good card.
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:54.540]  I don't know what category that would fall into, but I do like it.
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:56.860]  He's a pitcher and he's looking majestic.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:57.320]  Yeah.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.180]  He's got the chest hair.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:10:59.800]  It's just looking like...
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.660]  That's a good picture of him.
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:00.800]  He's a man.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:01.540]  It's like a picture of a man.
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:01.900]  He's a manly man.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:02.200]  Yeah.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:03.960]  Joel Davis.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:05.300]  Holy...
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:05.980]  Fuckin' shit.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:09.520]  We got to put that in some sort of eyebrow mustache combo.
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:12.600]  His mustache looks like it should be eyebrows also.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.880]  It also looks like it's uneven.
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:17.520]  It's like thin and long here and short and fat stops there.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.260]  That's awesome.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.760]  And then he definitely shaves in there.
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.100]  He's definitely a U-brow.
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:23.820]  If the edges of his eyebrows went up, it would be perfectly symmetrical.
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:25.520]  Kevin Gross.
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:26.880]  Looks like he's...
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.060]  dancing, I guess.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.460]  Brian Downing.
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:34.500]  Also a boring baseball card.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:35.800]  Oh!
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:36.760]  Lupinella.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:37.540]  All right.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.220]  There you go.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.260]  Good manager card there.
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:39.920]  There's a manager.
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:41.900]  Mark Rial.
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:45.020]  Jim Deshaies.
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:47.740]  Keith Morland.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:54.220]  Oh, there you go.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.400]  Our sound guy, Mike.
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:56.500]  That's his buddy.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.380]  Keith Morland goes in the Friends of Mike category.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:58.720]  Yeah!
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:00.520]  Jody Davis.
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:01.460]  What's he like?
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:03.560]  Very nice.
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:04.860]  Looked like he was going to go,
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.160]  a real son of a bitch.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:06.800]  He's my friend.
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:07.700]  I fuckin' hate him.
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:09.800]  He's a real piece of shit.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.540]  It looks like...
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:13.180]  So his foot in the front and the foot in the back
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:15.140]  are both sort of covered up with, like, logos.
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.000]  And I thought he was floating.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.080]  Because the front foot was covered
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.900]  and the back foot just looks like it's in the air.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  Eric thought he was floating, Pyle.
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.500]  I thought he was floating, Pyle.
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.540]  Our hit pile is always bigger than our discard pile.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:27.600]  Frank Williams.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.480]  After, like, ten of these break shits,
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.100]  we should go back through the cards we keep
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:32.600]  and try to figure out why we kept them.
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:33.280]  Yeah.
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.040]  At some point, I'm going to have to watch every one of these
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.760]  to figure out where these go categorically
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.620]  so we can sell them later.
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:38.980]  Good luck.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:39.920]  Willie Frazier.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:43.200]  Another boring-ass Ed Lynch card.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.200]  Oh, Ellis Burks.
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:44.880]  That's nice.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:46.820]  He's a good player.
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.000]  Real fans, not cut-outs.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:49.320]  Real fans, yeah.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:49.980]  They look like cut-outs there, right?
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:51.640]  All right, 91 tops.
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:52.940]  This will be the end of that little run.
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:53.360]  Okay.
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:54.860]  Great.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.960]  And then we'll try to get away from baseball for a second.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:58.740]  Oh, and then get back to baseball,
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.560]  because I have much more baseball.
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:02.200]  Then why get away from baseball?
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:02.680]  I don't know.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.820]  I don't know.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.440]  All right, here we go with Tim Sherrill.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:09.280]  Wait.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.300]  Did we get this card?
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:11.960]  Yeah.
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.540]  That's the guy with the dip lip.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:14.360]  Oh, that's dip lip.
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.080]  We have that card.
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:15.960]  It's a double dip lip.
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:16.960]  Double dip lip.
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.380]  Mark Gardner, good eyes on that one, Eric.
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:19.820]  Good memory.
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:20.980]  Is that me?
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:21.720]  Is that you?
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:22.420]  Is that me?
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:23.640]  Aww.
[01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:30.690]  Oh, that goes in the Is That Eric category.
[01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.930]  Can I just fade them over each other?
[01:13:31.930 --> 01:13:32.150]  Yeah, wait.
[01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:32.570]  Oh, yeah.
[01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:33.050]  Can we do that?
[01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:34.050]  Good luck.
[01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:34.930]  No, wait.
[01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.730]  Okay, so he's this way.
[01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:36.910]  Less teeth.
[01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:38.350]  A little less teeth, yeah.
[01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:39.630]  Oh, that's good.
[01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:41.750]  Can I hold it?
[01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.390]  Hold.
[01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:43.590]  I'm assuming for a couple hours.
[01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.430]  Uh-oh.
[01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:46.450]  The size is a little different, but that's fine.
[01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:48.330]  Yeah.
[01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:50.390]  Is that ready to birth?
[01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:52.610]  Yeah, we're fixing the...
[01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:55.310]  You gotta move the camera a little bit so it's like those cards from earlier.
[01:13:57.450 --> 01:13:58.470]  The ghost card.
[01:13:59.210 --> 01:14:00.410]  The refractors or whatever.
[01:14:00.730 --> 01:14:01.910]  It's one of those sports flicks cards.
[01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.730]  Yeah.
[01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:03.870]  We made our own sports flicks.
[01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:04.550]  Here, watch this.
[01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:06.690]  Woo.
[01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:09.250]  I love it.
[01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:14.290]  That was pretty good.
[01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:15.190]  That was really good.
[01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:15.430]  That was excellent.
[01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:17.110]  Great work, Booth.
[01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:17.630]  That was on the fly.
[01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:18.570]  And Nicholas killed it.
[01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:19.090]  That was great.
[01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:20.170]  That was awesome, guys.
[01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:21.910]  This show is way more fun than a sports flick.
[01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:24.590]  We're opening cards from 1991.
[01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:25.370]  Carl Nicholas.
[01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:26.990]  We had that one, too.
[01:14:27.210 --> 01:14:27.330]  Yeah.
[01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:29.130]  Well, you know, Larry Walker.
[01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:29.810]  There's only so many.
[01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:31.610]  Larry Walker was a pretty good player.
[01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:32.550]  All-star football players.
[01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:33.910]  Played for the Rockies, yeah.
[01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:34.830]  Danny Jackson.
[01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:35.790]  That's a good kick.
[01:14:36.650 --> 01:14:37.550]  That is a good kick.
[01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:37.950]  That is a...
[01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:39.910]  Hey, we were collecting high kicks before.
[01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.590]  High kick, that's a good kick.
[01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:42.670]  It's like a knee-above-penis card.
[01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:44.730]  Mike Federer.
[01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:47.070]  That's a backwards arm.
[01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:49.110]  That's a backwards everything.
[01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:50.650]  And his face is like...
[01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:51.810]  And he's got dip.
[01:14:52.050 --> 01:14:53.450]  He's got a lot going on there.
[01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:54.950]  That fits in multiple categories.
[01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:57.330]  Harold Reynolds.
[01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:00.150]  Again, I thought he was floating.
[01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:01.550]  Yeah, he definitely kind of looks...
[01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:02.610]  Or halfway through the thriller.
[01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:03.590]  That's a strong arm.
[01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:05.150]  Like, arm-to-leg ratio is off.
[01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:05.590]  Yeah.
[01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:06.670]  It's true.
[01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:08.130]  That's a good vein amount.
[01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.930]  It's a veiny arm.
[01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:09.230]  Exactly.
[01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:13.770]  He looks like that dude in that M. Night Shyamalan movie that only worked out with one arm.
[01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.150]  And he was like the...
[01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:16.890]  He had one big arm and one normal arm.
[01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:17.150]  Yeah.
[01:15:17.490 --> 01:15:18.090]  You know what I'm talking about.
[01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:19.630]  Lady and the...
[01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:20.030]  Swimming pool?
[01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:20.590]  Yeah.
[01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:21.170]  What was that one called?
[01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:21.690]  Lady and the Swimming Pool.
[01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:22.510]  You saw that one?
[01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:23.310]  Lady and the Swimming Pool.
[01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:24.610]  Dallas Bryce Howard was in it, I think.
[01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:26.890]  George Brett.
[01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:28.190]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:29.610]  Oh, Moshe borrowed that.
[01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:30.790]  George Brett's fucking awesome.
[01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.950]  That's a false bat.
[01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:32.330]  That's George Brett, dude.
[01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:32.950]  I'm trying to look...
[01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:34.390]  Pine Tar's a little bit high on that bat.
[01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:37.810]  Poor George Brett.
[01:15:37.810 --> 01:15:39.270]  Jose Canseco.
[01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:40.950]  That dude right there.
[01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:44.190]  I bet his nuts in that photo are the smallest they've been in his entire life.
[01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:45.750]  That was at the height of it for him.
[01:15:46.450 --> 01:15:48.150]  That ball went 580 feet.
[01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.690]  Yeah, it did.
[01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:51.850]  Daryl Irvine.
[01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:55.550]  And then he cried uncontrollably in the hotel room later and he didn't know why.
[01:15:57.130 --> 01:15:57.850]  John Burkett.
[01:15:58.350 --> 01:16:00.250]  I don't even know what to say about that.
[01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:00.790]  That's you.
[01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:02.050]  That's you, Geoff.
[01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:03.210]  That is definitely...
[01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:05.030]  That is definitely a pitching stance.
[01:16:05.190 --> 01:16:07.250]  How far do you think you could hit a baseball?
[01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:08.730]  Like, with the bat.
[01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:09.390]  Oh.
[01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:10.610]  Uh...
[01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:12.750]  Like, Jose Canseco can do it 500 feet.
[01:16:13.190 --> 01:16:13.950]  I could probably hit a bat...
[01:16:14.530 --> 01:16:17.010]  I could probably hit a ball 240.
[01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:18.010]  Okay.
[01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.290]  No.
[01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:20.630]  No, I mean, you can't, but yeah.
[01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:21.910]  I could probably hit a ball 240.
[01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:22.690]  240 what?
[01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.630]  240 feet.
[01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:25.050]  How far is it easily to go home run?
[01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:26.270]  That'd put it in mid-outfield.
[01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:27.550]  400 and...
[01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:28.910]  Dead center's 400.
[01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:32.130]  The corners are probably like 325 on short fields.
[01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:34.290]  So it's basically saying, can I hit a ball into the outfield?
[01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:39.330]  When we play baseball on the weekends, we jump a fence and go play like a little league field.
[01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:40.310]  It's like 170 feet.
[01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:43.130]  And when we muscle it over that, we feel like big, strong dudes.
[01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:44.170]  That's great.
[01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:44.530]  Yeah.
[01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:47.310]  So you're saying 240 and...
[01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:49.210]  Well, Geoff is a big, strong dude.
[01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:51.370]  240's not that far to hit a baseball.
[01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:52.490]  I agree.
[01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:52.930]  Crazy pack.
[01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:53.710]  I just don't think you can do it.
[01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:54.430]  Mark McGuire.
[01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:56.510]  Wow, we got Canseco and McGuire?
[01:16:56.770 --> 01:17:00.710]  Not only do we get Canseco and McGuire and the Bash brothers in the same pack at the height of their fame,
[01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:06.810]  we also got Mark McGuire stealing a base, apparently, which is not what he was known for.
[01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:08.710]  He was known for steroids and home runs.
[01:17:09.330 --> 01:17:10.410]  He was not a fast man.
[01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:12.230]  That's probably when he was at his smallest, too.
[01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:13.070]  Yeah, probably is.
[01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:14.290]  Mark Knudson.
[01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:15.450]  Nice.
[01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.830]  Tom Liana.
[01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:19.170]  And Terry Shumpert.
[01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:22.190]  Not a single goddamn zimmer in all of those.
[01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.610]  Sad.
[01:17:22.650 --> 01:17:23.090]  That's a shame.
[01:17:23.170 --> 01:17:23.810]  But we're not done.
[01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:25.830]  Love it.
[01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:26.150]  Excellent.
[01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:28.190]  Have we had a break shit without a zimple?
[01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:29.150]  Last episode.
[01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:29.910]  Yeah, I think the last one was.
[01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:30.530]  The first one, I think.
[01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:32.810]  You're going to be on a zimmer dry spell.
[01:17:33.090 --> 01:17:33.190]  Yeah.
[01:17:33.370 --> 01:17:35.070]  I bought these for today's...
[01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.890]  I'm very excited about these.
[01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:38.910]  This is the first pack of 2021 WNBA Prism.
[01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:40.590]  I've been collecting WNBA Prism lately.
[01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:41.710]  I'm really enjoying them.
[01:17:43.170 --> 01:17:46.070]  I was supposed to open this on a daily rip, but I guess I don't need to because we're here.
[01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:48.210]  I saw your rip, by the way.
[01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:48.710]  Thank you.
[01:17:48.810 --> 01:17:49.850]  Yeah, it was good. I commented on it.
[01:17:49.930 --> 01:17:50.210]  Thanks.
[01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:52.030]  Someone had to do it.
[01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:53.090]  I noticed Geoff hadn't done his yet.
[01:17:53.130 --> 01:17:53.610]  I did it.
[01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:54.290]  I did it that night.
[01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:55.530]  Yeah, you did it that night.
[01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:56.330]  I mean...
[01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:57.130]  It was survivor night.
[01:17:57.130 --> 01:17:58.250]  It's not called the nightly rip.
[01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:58.610]  It was survivor night.
[01:17:58.770 --> 01:17:59.150]  I was just saying.
[01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:02.510]  It's not called the evening rip.
[01:18:03.210 --> 01:18:03.930]  Alyssa Thomas.
[01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:06.010]  These cards are nice.
[01:18:06.130 --> 01:18:06.950]  Well, these are Prism cards, man.
[01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:07.670]  These are fucking...
[01:18:07.670 --> 01:18:08.490]  I don't know what that means.
[01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:09.430]  Look at this.
[01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:10.270]  Look at the shine on them.
[01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.690]  These are chrome.
[01:18:12.370 --> 01:18:13.490]  Leah Wilson, rookie.
[01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:14.370]  That's cool.
[01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:14.910]  I like the design on these.
[01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:16.230]  The rookie cards are fucking...
[01:18:16.230 --> 01:18:17.470]  All the rookie cards have these.
[01:18:17.530 --> 01:18:18.370]  I really like that a lot.
[01:18:18.370 --> 01:18:19.450]  The NBA ones do as well.
[01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:20.190]  They're fucking gorgeous.
[01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:22.930]  I don't think I had any NBA cards for us to open, though.
[01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:23.930]  Tierra McCallum.
[01:18:26.650 --> 01:18:27.370]  Marina Mabry.
[01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:29.050]  Oh, here we go.
[01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:30.470]  Now, that's a nice card.
[01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:31.690]  Get these out of the way.
[01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:32.870]  Look at this.
[01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:33.950]  Fucking Erica Wheeler.
[01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:35.010]  Oh, that card's sick.
[01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:35.490]  That's awesome.
[01:18:35.730 --> 01:18:38.850]  These are the best cards I think we've ever opened on the show.
[01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:40.130]  Well, technology has come on a long way.
[01:18:40.170 --> 01:18:40.370]  Yeah, really.
[01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:41.450]  And you can see...
[01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:42.470]  I think maybe that's what it is.
[01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:46.090]  Opening right next to some 1991s, and everyone looked like the way they did, and then it's
[01:18:46.090 --> 01:18:46.310]  this.
[01:18:46.410 --> 01:18:46.870]  You're like, all right.
[01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:48.770]  So the difference between the normal cards...
[01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:49.910]  I think I showed this last time, too.
[01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:51.090]  But this is a normal card.
[01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:51.710]  Well, it's a rookie card.
[01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:53.990]  But on the back, you can see...
[01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:58.370]  Then when you get a special card, a parallel, or a refractor, or some kind of a special
[01:18:58.370 --> 01:19:00.490]  card, it'll tell you on the back.
[01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:01.090]  It's a prism.
[01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:03.070]  It'll have it right there, so you can tell the difference.
[01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:04.970]  So, just FYI.
[01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:05.570]  Prism.
[01:19:06.210 --> 01:19:06.530]  Prism.
[01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:08.030]  This is a base...
[01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:09.270]  So this is what's called a base prism.
[01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:14.130]  It's just the base card, but this is the prism version of it, and you can see it is much shinier
[01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:17.150]  and much more colorful than this one.
[01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:18.290]  Where do the Sparks play?
[01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:20.250]  I know it's Los Angeles, but like...
[01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:20.410]  Oh, yeah.
[01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:25.690]  These are worth like about five times what it would be worth if it wasn't a prism.
[01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:26.490]  Well, they played Staples.
[01:19:26.670 --> 01:19:26.910]  That's cool.
[01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:31.990]  Get hyped for Crystal Dangerfield.
[01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:33.990]  What a name!
[01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:36.510]  May or may not be related to Rodney.
[01:19:36.610 --> 01:19:37.050]  I'm not sure.
[01:19:37.470 --> 01:19:39.470]  I don't know how that goes, but...
[01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:42.970]  Crystal Dangerfield is a fucking cool pro wrestling name.
[01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:43.610]  Crystal Dangerfield.
[01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:45.350]  We could put it up with the...
[01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:46.870]  What was the other one we had earlier?
[01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:49.390]  John St. Clair.
[01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:50.170]  Bud Black or something.
[01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:52.370]  Bud Black was a good one, yeah.
[01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:53.530]  Oh, shit, dude.
[01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:54.730]  Courtney VanderSloot.
[01:19:54.850 --> 01:19:56.370]  She is ripping it up in the playoffs.
[01:19:56.610 --> 01:19:56.810]  Cool.
[01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:58.190]  She's fucking awesome.
[01:19:58.730 --> 01:19:59.130]  Save that.
[01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:01.390]  Brittany Sykes.
[01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:04.270]  Arielle Powers.
[01:20:04.730 --> 01:20:06.210]  Who's the person in the background of the card?
[01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:07.570]  Of hers. Go back.
[01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:09.690]  Oh, my God.
[01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:11.390]  She is getting...
[01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:13.730]  She's on the back, too.
[01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:17.490]  She's sneaking in.
[01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:18.630]  My card, too.
[01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:19.690]  This is my card.
[01:20:19.890 --> 01:20:21.890]  It's like she knew it was a photo for the card.
[01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:23.010]  We're definitely keeping that one.
[01:20:24.590 --> 01:20:25.310]  Kayla Thornton.
[01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.390]  And...
[01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.970]  Three arms.
[01:20:28.770 --> 01:20:29.810]  Oh, my God.
[01:20:29.970 --> 01:20:30.810]  Gavin, that's amazing.
[01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:31.690]  She has three arms.
[01:20:32.190 --> 01:20:33.230]  Really incredible stuff.
[01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:33.730]  That's an extra.
[01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:34.430]  So we have...
[01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.910]  Oh, wow.
[01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:36.470]  It looks cool in the back, too.
[01:20:36.530 --> 01:20:39.730]  We'll have to have an extra limbs section for those cards.
[01:20:41.290 --> 01:20:42.010]  And then...
[01:20:42.010 --> 01:20:43.490]  Misha Hines-Allen.
[01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:45.710]  Just a regular face card.
[01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.390]  There you go.
[01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.890]  That was that.
[01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:48.270]  I've been holding on to that for about a week.
[01:20:48.370 --> 01:20:48.930]  Those are cool.
[01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.890]  I like those cards.
[01:20:50.230 --> 01:20:50.930]  I do, too.
[01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:52.470]  We've got some more baseball.
[01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.770]  This year, baseball.
[01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:56.790]  We're not going to open that Sailor Moon today or maybe ever.
[01:20:57.490 --> 01:20:57.970]  That was a waste.
[01:20:58.190 --> 01:20:58.410]  Sorry, Gus.
[01:20:59.130 --> 01:21:00.070]  Maybe when Gus comes on.
[01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:01.050]  Should we...
[01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:01.570]  Let's do...
[01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:03.950]  Let's get back to Twin Peaks and 007 since we've got Gavin here.
[01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.410]  Let's do it.
[01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:07.350]  The 007 cards, I feel like we're never going to get through.
[01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:08.290]  What do you mean?
[01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:10.910]  There's so many of them somehow.
[01:21:12.230 --> 01:21:12.550]  Somehow.
[01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:15.130]  I feel like we open them every episode.
[01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:17.910]  Other stuff goes so fast, but these are...
[01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:19.070]  Andrew, do you like the 007 cards?
[01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:21.030]  I think they're pretty good.
[01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:22.630]  They're all just from one movie, though, right?
[01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:23.690]  Isn't it almost all...
[01:21:23.690 --> 01:21:24.550]  It's supposed to be archives.
[01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:27.270]  So it's supposed to be all the movies up to 2015.
[01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:29.510]  The new one came out today, right?
[01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:31.550]  Yeah, I don't think those are...
[01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:32.330]  I don't think it's in this.
[01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:36.230]  Think about the cards for the movie that came out today or what?
[01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:37.330]  He hates the globe.
[01:21:37.450 --> 01:21:38.610]  James Bond's about to shoot a globe.
[01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:40.090]  Famously hates the globe.
[01:21:40.150 --> 01:21:41.290]  James Bond versus the world.
[01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:42.150]  Yes.
[01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.370]  There's...
[01:21:44.370 --> 01:21:46.550]  Yeah, these are all quantum again, aren't they?
[01:21:47.630 --> 01:21:47.870]  Hello.
[01:21:49.670 --> 01:21:51.130]  Is he using a rotary phone?
[01:21:51.370 --> 01:21:51.750]  Dench!
[01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:53.090]  We got Dench.
[01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:54.190]  We got Dench on deck.
[01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:56.630]  Should we do a rotary phone section too?
[01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:58.870]  Emily, can we get a sound for Dench?
[01:21:59.110 --> 01:22:00.150]  We need a good sound for Dench.
[01:22:00.170 --> 01:22:02.850]  A sound that represents Judi Dench as much as possible.
[01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:09.710]  These are labeled interesting.
[01:22:10.330 --> 01:22:11.010]  Let's see.
[01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:15.250]  You don't see that every day.
[01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:16.990]  Classic Dench.
[01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:17.950]  Classic Dench.
[01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:19.170]  That's it right there.
[01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:21.370]  What? That's awesome.
[01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:23.910]  This guy's about to fucking eat it.
[01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:28.190]  James Bond's like, when I look at you, I see a globe.
[01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:33.350]  And then whatever the fuck that is.
[01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:35.650]  No one here is James Bond.
[01:22:36.010 --> 01:22:36.950]  I don't even know what...
[01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:38.090]  This was from Quantum of Solace.
[01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:38.570]  Quantum.
[01:22:39.370 --> 01:22:41.450]  Alright, moving on to the next Bond card.
[01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:42.170]  God damn.
[01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:44.630]  It's like they're growing in the pack.
[01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:45.210]  In the box.
[01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:50.750]  It's like there's a false bottom and every time I take a pack out, somebody sticks one in.
[01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:53.670]  I think Millie's doing like a prank where she's buying more and putting them in.
[01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:54.990]  You're just like, what the fuck?
[01:22:55.090 --> 01:22:56.090]  What a waste of money.
[01:22:57.930 --> 01:22:58.330]  Oh.
[01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:59.290]  Sleep in the car.
[01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:01.070]  Woman again.
[01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:02.210]  Here we go.
[01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:03.850]  Action walk.
[01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:06.410]  Uh...
[01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:07.350]  Is Bryce does Howard?
[01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:09.210]  Oh, it's a Sean Bean.
[01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:10.390]  We got a Bean.
[01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:11.070]  Bean alert.
[01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:13.890]  Finally something that isn't Quantum of Solace.
[01:23:16.190 --> 01:23:18.070]  That's the Bean car, hop on in.
[01:23:19.290 --> 01:23:21.130]  Sean Bean's here to pick you up.
[01:23:26.690 --> 01:23:28.030]  You play the sound again.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.180]  I'm here, James.
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:33.660]  I'm here.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.240]  You're like...
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.700]  And Sean Bean's like, get in.
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.160]  Get in the busted car.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:44.720]  Oh, fuck.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.300]  Somebody needs to record this lore.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:47.160]  We're going to lose it.
[01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:47.720]  I hate it.
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:48.700]  We're recording it.
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:50.840]  I know, but we're not going to do anything with it.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.000]  We're going to forget about it next time.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.000]  And then an action motorcycle shot.
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:54.480]  Okay.
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:56.000]  Next pack.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.400]  No denture that way.
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:23:59.300]  There's definitely more cards in it.
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:00.400]  There's more...
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:04.920]  Alright.
[01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:05.980]  Uh...
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:06.260]  Oh.
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:08.140]  Well.
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:10.900]  There's a...
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:11.200]  That.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.020]  Card.
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:12.520]  Who...
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:16.640]  We've got, uh...
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.160]  Geoffrey.
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:19.380]  We've got...
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:20.620]  Lily Allen's husband.
[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:22.440]  We've got...
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.540]  Is that Lily Allen's husband?
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:24.540]  Yeah, in the middle.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:25.520]  Who is it?
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:26.700]  I didn't know that.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.000]  Who is he?
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:29.240]  David Harbour.
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:31.240]  Is that David Harbour?
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:31.740]  Yeah!
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.020]  It is!
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:34.280]  Oh, shit!
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:35.100]  I didn't realize.
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:36.520]  Oh, that didn't look...
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:37.560]  That doesn't look like him.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:38.840]  Is it not him?
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:39.420]  That's him!
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.340]  No, I think it is.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.340]  That makes sense.
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:42.080]  Let's see.
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:42.800]  David Harbour.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:44.460]  James Bond.
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:45.820]  Oh, he was in one.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:47.780]  Yeah, that's him.
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:48.820]  This is, uh...
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.120]  This is, uh...
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:57.740]  I think this scene was cut, but this is where Daniel Craig walks up on Indiana Jones...
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:02.060]  ...right before he fights the big German dude on the plane.
[01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:02.120]  That's awesome.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.860]  That's Indiana Jones' stand-in right there.
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.520]  Things didn't go well for that plane.
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:10.960]  It's her again.
[01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:12.000]  There's that lady.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.520]  Oh, here she is.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.360]  Walking down the street.
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.240]  Isn't that the same car you started with?
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:17.760]  Probably.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.020]  Is that after the plane crashed?
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:20.700]  Daniel Craig.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:23.180]  There's some padding in that jacket.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.140]  He's trying to be like Steve McQueen in that.
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:25.580]  Yeah, he is.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.200]  That's... man.
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.140]  Boy, wow.
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.000]  And then, uh, that one.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.340]  He's just, uh...
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.500]  Doing some action gardening.
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:37.440]  Are you opening another one of these?
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.200]  What's he holding?
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.920]  There's so many more to open.
[01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:40.800]  He's not holding anything.
[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:42.720]  I think there's just something that's, like, next to his hand.
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.200]  Oh, I thought he was holding a packet of crisps.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:44.840]  Show me.
[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:46.040]  Still to open.
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.620]  Uh, there's that one.
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:50.920]  So this is why I was saying you have to have, like, the...
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.360]  Like, the tops and bottoms and the sides.
[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:55.800]  Because Geoff will just find a spot that almost doesn't make it on camera.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:56.600]  Yeah.
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:58.880]  And then there's that one.
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:00.380]  Okay.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.060]  Another Geoffrey Wright.
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:04.540]  And then there's that cool shot.
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:06.680]  And then... oh!
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:07.720]  Looks like he's in Waterworld.
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:08.240]  How about that?
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.220]  Not every day you see one of those.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.560]  Is that the thing at LAX?
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:17.620]  That's, uh...
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:19.100]  Stromberg's house.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.040]  That's a picture of LAX.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:21.300]  Yeah.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:22.980]  I love that.
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:23.440]  That's great.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.340]  James Bond about to shoot a ceiling tile out.
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:27.120]  Or maybe there's a globe up there.
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:28.160]  There's raccoons in the ceiling!
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.340]  There might be a globe.
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:31.440]  Okay.
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:34.060]  Uh, and then more action car shots.
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.540]  All right, this is the last one we're gonna...
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:35.820]  Okay.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:37.340]  There are so many!
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:37.800]  That's the last one.
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:39.480]  There are so many left.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.160]  That's insane.
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:42.860]  I'm just gonna put it away so I don't see it.
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:45.420]  Is it crazy that I hate these less than the Umbrella Academy?
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.540]  Like, I'm fine with these.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:48.440]  I feel like occasionally we get a good one here.
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:49.660]  I hate the Umbrella Academy cards.
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.520]  You really don't like them, do you?
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:51.040]  I hate them.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:51.440]  I think they suck.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.840]  You should watch the show and then you'll love them.
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:54.340]  No, I don't think I'm ever gonna do that.
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:54.940]  It's such a good show.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.280]  If I don't want to watch you open Umbrella Academy cards,
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:58.560]  why would I watch the show?
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.400]  It's just the cards, but longer.
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:04.480]  This is pensive Daniel Craig.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:07.720]  Uh, I don't know what's going on there.
[01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:11.180]  It's like a slap fight of some kind.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.600]  Fucking sibling slap fight, we'll call that.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:16.840]  Yeah.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:17.860]  Little pursed lips.
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:21.260]  This is pesos.
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:23.320]  Pesos.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.820]  Oh, that's another dench.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.180]  That's a small dench.
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.140]  You don't see that every day.
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:32.740]  Nice.
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:33.320]  Thank you.
[01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:33.860]  Nice.
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:35.680]  Is that Judi Dench saying that?
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:36.820]  Yeah, it sounds like her.
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:39.080]  Oh, here's one you don't see every day.
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:41.380]  Uh, Daniel Craig and that lady in a vehicle.
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.300]  Oh, they're in the plane now.
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:44.480]  Oh, that's a pretty cool one.
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:45.340]  Heard that doesn't go well.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:45.960]  Doesn't go well.
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:46.680]  That's not bad.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.580]  Cool action shot on the boat.
[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:49.740]  It's very far away.
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:50.980]  He's like Batman in that card.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.800]  Goodbye James Bond cards.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.680]  That was it, huh?
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.020]  That was it for this episode.
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:02.360]  Don't worry, there's 7,000 packs left in this box.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:09.240]  What I appreciate about those packs is I've seen Quantum of Solace and I don't recognize a single photo from it.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.280]  There's never been one where I remember the scene.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.280]  It might be the most forgettable movie.
[01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:14.940]  What happens in that movie, Andrew?
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:17.700]  The building blows up at the end, right?
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:20.140]  They have a plane, apparently, but I've learned that from you.
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.700]  Do you remember anything from that movie?
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.580]  Yeah, it's like an opera scene.
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:29.620]  I couldn't tell if you were lying to me right now.
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:30.680]  Guy with a bad haircut.
[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:33.300]  I'm sorry.
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:38.400]  These cards are called Clearly Authentic.
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:39.320]  You'll see why.
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:44.460]  Here's what I don't know when I bought this.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:48.280]  I thought I was buying a box of a bunch of cards because I paid like 200 bucks for this.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:50.480]  This is going to be the big thing at the end.
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:53.100]  And I think it might be one card.
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.280]  It says one autographed card.
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:57.900]  There's not a lot of weight to that.
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:02.060]  I think Geoff bought a bunch of other cards and they're guaranteeing there's one autographed card.
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:03.040]  Yeah.
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:04.920]  I hope it's that card.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:07.940]  I hope it's the Bryce Harper card on the front.
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:09.100]  That's what you get every time.
[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:12.060]  They just made Bryce Harper sign a lot.
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.060]  We told you what it was.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:13.860]  It's on the fucking cover.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:14.820]  It's on the fucking front.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.480]  This is a $200 single card.
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:20.780]  So this is the big one.
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:24.760]  And then after this, maybe we'll do one or two and then we'll transition in two.
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:28.980]  I want to get to the Barbie of it all before we run out of time because I know we have a hard out this time.
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:29.220]  Yeah.
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:35.780]  Let's see what $200 flushed down the toilet looks like.
[01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:41.140]  Is that White Sox?
[01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:42.680]  It is a White Sox card.
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:44.260]  Who is it?
[01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:45.280]  Well, look at it on...
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:47.540]  Really?
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.660]  I need to be able to talk about it.
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:51.600]  So number 5 of 10.
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.320]  It's a Dale Dunning rookie card.
[01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:55.300]  I don't know who he is.
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:00.020]  I've watched a lot of White Sox this year.
[01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:00.240]  What's his name?
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.000]  Did it say 87?
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:03.420]  It's Dale.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:04.480]  No, Dane.
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:04.820]  I'm sorry.
[01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:05.560]  Dane Dunning.
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.640]  I can't read his signature very well.
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.240]  Yeah.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:09.400]  His name is printed on the card.
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:10.920]  Oh, I was just reading his signature.
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:11.360]  Dane.
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:11.700]  Yeah.
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.360]  5 of 10 though.
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:16.180]  Only 10 of that in the world.
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:18.120]  Oh, we should get a table with a light built in.
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:19.340]  Just for these moments.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:22.320]  So...
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:24.880]  This is about what? About 20 bucks?
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:26.100]  Well, hey, but hold up.
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:26.900]  That's not the purple one.
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:27.620]  5 of 10.
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:28.780]  This...
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:31.560]  I mean, this is the top's clearly authentic Dane Dunning.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:34.020]  But it's not the purple 5 of 10.
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:35.360]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:35.980]  See it from behind?
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.840]  I mean...
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.600]  That's the base one you're looking at.
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:44.000]  Yeah, look at the right one, Eric.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.680]  This one's probably not on eBay because there's only 10 of them on Earth.
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:48.060]  Here we go.
[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:50.200]  And who knows if they've even been pulled yet.
[01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.040]  Is it this one?
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:53.480]  I can't see.
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:55.280]  Read it to me.
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:57.040]  2020 Vision.
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:59.200]  Yeah, but it's fucking tiny.
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:30:59.820]  Give me the thing.
[01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:05.060]  Purple Auto.
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:05.760]  Yeah, okay.
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:07.040]  So, that's right.
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:08.180]  Uh-huh. And how much?
[01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:08.840]  60 bucks.
[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:09.100]  Okay.
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:10.240]  Yeah, well, you know...
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:10.720]  What number is that one?
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:13.380]  It just says of 10.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:14.120]  Okay.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.160]  Anyway, these are the clearly cards.
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:18.460]  I always get the best.
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:19.020]  That's cool.
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:19.940]  I still...
[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:21.060]  It's a good-looking card.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.400]  Hey, if he has a Hall of Fame career, I'll be able to retire off that.
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:28.960]  Alright, 2021 Dane Dunning stats.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.640]  I just need him to have a Hall of Fame career.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.700]  I think he's won seven games and lost nine in his career.
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:35.480]  Wow.
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.440]  He also no longer plays for the White Sox.
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:39.460]  He's a ranger.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:40.540]  He's a ranger now.
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:42.360]  That must be why I didn't recognize him.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.040]  Yeah, that sucks.
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:45.420]  Well, it'll be easy to stand out.
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:46.400]  Alright, we got 25 minutes.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:49.540]  Alright, should we move on to the big segment?
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:52.420]  And then if we run it, if we go past that, we can always go back to the pack side.
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:52.900]  Absolutely.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:53.740]  Okay.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:58.720]  So, a while back, and the reason my lovely girlfriend Emily is here,
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:01.260]  other than to be a better sound operator than Gavin has ever been,
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:04.220]  is because I found these a while back.
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:06.340]  Another first for Barbie.
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:09.840]  These are Barbie trading cards.
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:12.280]  I bought a box for Emily.
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.360]  And we sat and we opened them.
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.340]  And as we were opening the Barbie trading cards,
[01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:18.680]  she kept going like, oh, I used to have that outfit.
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:19.800]  I used to have that Barbie in that outfit.
[01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:23.300]  And I realized, oh, these are like iconic looks from the history of Barbie.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:27.580]  And I said, you had this, like you had this particular one.
[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:29.500]  And she would go, yeah, I have it. It's in our storage.
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.180]  I can go get it right now and show it to you.
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:34.420]  And I thought, what if Emily went through the full list
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:39.660]  and then she put a bunch of Barbies in the outfits that are in these cards.
[01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:41.400]  And those are our chase Barbies.
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:44.220]  And then when we open up the cards, we try to get those Barbies.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:47.880]  You have Alvin and was her name Brittany?
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:51.000]  Yeah, this is from the original Alvin and the Chipmunks.
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:53.900]  This is my suitcase that I would take.
[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:58.460]  I would usually pack it when I was being dramatic and going to run away from home.
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:04.100]  And I would go sit at the end of the driveway or the end of the street for just a little bit.
[01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:04.960]  And I'd usually have my Barbies.
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:05.440]  What age was this?
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:05.880]  Seventeen.
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:12.500]  This movie came out in 1990, so I was, what, four or five?
[01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:18.200]  That's not us making you sound old.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:22.860]  So I thought this would be good to bring my Barbies in.
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.400]  So you'll show us the Barbies that you've curated.
[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:27.400]  Oh, so you already curated the Barbies.
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:28.440]  Yeah, she already went through.
[01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:29.240]  This is very exciting.
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:31.660]  And we verified that these Barbies are in the set.
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:31.880]  Okay.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.080]  So they should be in these boxes.
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:33.240]  Okay.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:37.120]  I have a big Tupperware of all of my Barbies.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:37.700]  Not all of them.
[01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:41.320]  I had a lot more, but I whittled it down growing up.
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:43.040]  The best of the best.
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:43.660]  The best of the best.
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:48.260]  So I went through and I made sure to grab ones that are actual Barbie outfits.
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:48.680]  Okay.
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:52.460]  Because I have a lot that my grandma made, and those are the ones I saved.
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:34:02.040]  I'd like to point out too, Emily, as you may or may not know, owns a hair salon and is a very sought-after and talented stylist.
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:06.960]  So you can see the beginnings of her career in some of these Barbies.
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:07.340]  Oh, no.
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:07.960]  Oh, yeah.
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:10.420]  She cut my wife's hair and it looks fantastic.
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:11.460]  So I'm excited to see it.
[01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:14.180]  Luckily, she cut her teeth on these Barbies first.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:21.160]  These Barbies are also in their 30s and their hair is not quite the same as it was when they first got it.
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:22.980]  So first we'll start with her.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:26.180]  She has two mismatching heels, but that's okay.
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:30.520]  We used to call Barbie shoes vacuum cleaner food.
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:33.940]  There's no way it stands up, right?
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.580]  Well, you can bend them. They sit.
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:37.660]  Oh.
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:38.800]  Yeah, like that.
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:41.020]  Why is she up like that?
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:42.940]  We have to show off the shoes.
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:43.960]  Okay.
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:47.540]  We have this Barbie who, she got a haircut.
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:48.220]  Beautiful.
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:49.560]  She doesn't have any shoes.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:52.280]  She's like a barefoot Contessa.
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:52.820]  Show feet?
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.400]  Yeah, it's all foot fetish content.
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:56.240]  Yeah.
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:59.440]  And Gavin touched her, her ass was hanging out of her.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:02.720]  With this Barbie, she's in a classic dress.
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:06.160]  Like this is an old Barbie one because it has the tag and the metal zipper.
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:09.660]  But it doesn't, the zipper doesn't quite go up all the way.
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:12.380]  But sometimes mine don't either, but that's okay.
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.600]  And then she has a nice little shawl to cover that.
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:16.880]  And has actual hair, this one.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:17.900]  Yeah, she has hair.
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:18.400]  You didn't get a hold of this one.
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:19.120]  It's kind of puffy.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.460]  She looks like, what's the, what's the snow movie?
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:23.080]  Let It Go.
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:24.160]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:24.700]  Elsa?
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:25.220]  Elsa.
[01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:30.480]  This is my Barbie that's in a really nice little outfit.
[01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:34.280]  She had a ponytail, but I think the rubber band disintegrated at some point.
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:42.180]  She also is wearing these roller blades that were banned because it's like a lighter on the bottom and sparks come out.
[01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:43.040]  That's awesome!
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:44.080]  Does it make sparks?
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:44.460]  Yeah.
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:45.080]  Oh yeah.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.960]  You can probably do it over the blue square.
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:48.620]  We gotta press down kind of hard.
[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:51.380]  Other one.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:52.140]  The other one?
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:52.520]  Yeah.
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:57.140]  I think it might not be hard enough.
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:58.560]  It's funny to be on the wood.
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.460]  Just whipping her.
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:01.660]  Don't do that.
[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:03.220]  Now you're gonna fuck up the whole card thing.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:04.140]  I won't fuck up the card thing.
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:05.080]  Oh my god.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:06.260]  Here, I won't fuck up the card thing.
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:06.760]  I know what I'm doing.
[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:07.740]  Professional.
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:09.220]  I'll roll it back.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:09.580]  Uh huh.
[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:10.860]  So that it doesn't leave its initials.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:11.200]  Uh huh.
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:15.240]  Just look at what he's doing to the table.
[01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:18.960]  No, you gotta like really push down hard on the bottom.
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:20.100]  There you go.
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:21.100]  Oh yeah, see that?
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:21.660]  No.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.180]  Oh, I do!
[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:23.960]  Well, the camera can't see.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.820]  Get in the front.
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:30.180]  Don't hold the front.
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:30.940]  I'm so stupid.
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:32.180]  Oh shit, I'm tied.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:33.240]  Yeah, I can't reach.
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.380]  I'm all tucked in.
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.120]  You're all tucked in?
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:38.600]  It's the pink one, yeah.
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.180]  With the yellow wheels.
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:45.320]  Alright, here we go.
[01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:47.520]  Nicholas is gonna get the shot and then we're doing it.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:48.280]  Ready?
[01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:48.900]  Yep.
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:53.640]  Oh no!
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:56.020]  The Barbie fell!
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:00.380]  Is it doing it?
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:00.980]  Yeah.
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:04.800]  Oh, you did it!
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:07.900]  We should see if we can start a fire with that.
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:08.860]  No, we probably shouldn't.
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:10.040]  No, like as an experiment.
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:10.840]  Like a campfire.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:11.820]  What if we had some flint?
[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:12.120]  Yes.
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:16.560]  I want somebody to bring that as their personal item on Survivor Day.
[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:17.400]  We got this.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:18.520]  We don't need the flint.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:20.040]  So they ban those because of that?
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:20.520]  Yeah.
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:22.160]  Yeah, I think it started fire.
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:22.860]  Wow.
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:28.320]  I mean, if it still works like that after 30-something years, I think they're a lot more powerful then.
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:32.680]  Where were the rest of the hit cards?
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.240]  On the floor?
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:37.540]  No, those are not the hits.
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:39.940]  I think these and then there was another pile of hits.
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:42.420]  These were the... oh well, fuck it, we'll deal with it later.
[01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:43.260]  Sounds good.
[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:44.980]  Okay, anyway, let's open some Barbie cards.
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:46.400]  So these are the Barbies we're looking for.
[01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:53.380]  Oh, and there's also Happy Birthday Barbie, which is the Barbie that my parents hired to come to my birthday party.
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:55.780]  A woman dressed up as Barbie.
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.960]  She showed up in the Happy Birthday outfit.
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:00.700]  She had a Corvette that had the Barbie logo on it.
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:01.020]  What?
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:03.120]  So we need to find that.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:04.400]  And she did our makeup and...
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:05.140]  What?
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:06.260]  That's cool as hell.
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.140]  Oh yeah, it was really cool.
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:08.380]  I gotta get a Corvette.
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:11.040]  She showed me a photo of this lady, which is...
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.400]  This is her after she...
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:13.640]  She is on Coke and Coors Light.
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:14.400]  After she did our makeup.
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:14.760]  Yeah?
[01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:15.540]  Yeah.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:19.160]  Whoa!
[01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:20.360]  That's me in the funeral dress.
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.240]  Why are you in a funeral dress?
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:22.520]  I don't know.
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:24.000]  I think I thought it was fancy.
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:25.520]  And I wanted to look good for her.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:27.520]  What year was this?
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:31.080]  Oh, probably, I don't know, like, 91, 93, you know?
[01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:32.320]  What was your hand on?
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.880]  I was resting it delicately on her dress.
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:35.480]  Oh, okay.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:37.060]  We can't miss a Barbie's clothes.
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:39.500]  Because I was so just, like, in love with it.
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:40.640]  She was Barbie.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:41.940]  And she took me a ride in the neighborhood.
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:44.700]  She looks like she's been to some concerts.
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:45.220]  Yeah.
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:47.640]  Ooh, I like that.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:48.620]  Tennis? That's us.
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:50.800]  So, that's 1990 tennis Barbie.
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:52.860]  1986 Barbie.
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:53.340]  Good year.
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:54.420]  In a bathing suit.
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.120]  86...
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:59.080]  This is just what it was like to work at Razor, except it was keyboards.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.760]  It's the same thing.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:01.980]  I did this for years.
[01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:05.340]  Make them light up.
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:06.760]  Got it, got it, got it.
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:08.160]  Anyone got USB cables?
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.240]  Fucking send it.
[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:10.620]  That's not one.
[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:11.380]  Uh-uh.
[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:12.480]  That's not one.
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:13.520]  No, but that's good.
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:14.200]  She's a butterfly.
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:14.800]  Oh!
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:16.960]  That's an interesting outfit.
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:18.940]  I don't know if that's...
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.780]  It's like a Moroccan Barbie, maybe?
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:23.240]  She looks like a flight attendant on, like, Singapore Air.
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:24.780]  That's a very cool fez.
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:28.760]  I like that all of her hair is still gigantic and she has a fez.
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:29.800]  That's cool.
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:31.180]  Yeah, it's very Emirates airline.
[01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:31.420]  Yeah.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:35.400]  Oh, here's a Barbie from 1965.
[01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:37.440]  She looks pissed.
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:38.120]  She does.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:38.760]  Oh, no.
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:38.800]  She does.
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:40.440]  Uh...
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:42.200]  69.
[01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:43.580]  Nice.
[01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:45.500]  That one...
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:46.560]  So, no hits yet.
[01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:48.500]  You can see how much her face changes.
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:49.160]  Yeah, really.
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:51.720]  She looks like she had a real human face in that other one.
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.060]  In the previous one.
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:53.600]  Yeah, go back one.
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.940]  That looks like a human face that was put on there.
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:39:58.580]  She needs bangs.
[01:39:58.580 --> 01:39:59.420]  That's a little bit uncanny valley there.
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:00.120]  Oh, you're right.
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:00.860]  You're right.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.600]  That looks kind of like the birthday Barbie.
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:04.480]  That's Alma's birthday.
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:08.380]  Is that the one that you see and, like, that's Barbie to you?
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:10.880]  Yes, like birthday Barbie, like, yeah.
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:12.740]  She looks like a newscaster.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.400]  There's 1985 Barbie.
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:18.460]  And...
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:19.740]  Oh, I like this one.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.340]  Ooh, that's country-western Barbie.
[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:23.320]  Yeah, she is.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.300]  She's like a...
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:25.540]  Oh, she's wearing LuLaRoe.
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:29.480]  Buttery soft.
[01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:31.820]  The top leggings are buttery soft.
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:35.600]  The top half of her looks like Woody from Toy Story.
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:36.080]  It might be.
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:39.580]  I think that she's about to take the stage at her country-western concert.
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:40.560]  Yee-haw.
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:41.520]  Ooh, that's good.
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:42.620]  Still no hitch yet.
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:44.700]  Uh-oh, this Barbie is about to leave her husband.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:46.760]  Well, she's running away.
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:47.560]  She's going to the end of the driveway.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:47.820]  Good for you.
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:48.760]  Good for you.
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:50.260]  It's enough.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:51.060]  Yes.
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.400]  You've put up with more than enough.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:54.380]  You did what you needed to do.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:54.840]  Exactly.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.540]  You should not feel guilty.
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:57.440]  She's on quaaludes.
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:00.100]  Like, she's at the party, but she's not at the party.
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.200]  That's back when you could get them, too.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.480]  She's on quaaludes.
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:05.060]  She's business Barbie, kind of a traveler.
[01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:05.600]  Uh-huh.
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:08.220]  That is...
[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:10.020]  This is country-western Barbie on her off day.
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:12.180]  That Barbie does not leave her house without...
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:13.160]  Not without my denim.
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:13.880]  Her denim.
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:16.460]  I'm a denim demon, dude.
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:17.840]  I like that denim on denim look.
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:19.520]  She's going out for lunch.
[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:20.020]  Oh, is that that pattern that's everywhere?
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:22.800]  What did you say?
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.520]  That little pattern on her skirt.
[01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:25.020]  Herringbone?
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:25.600]  Yeah.
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:28.420]  Night-night.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:29.040]  Night-night, Barbie.
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:33.560]  That's a fun hat.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.060]  It's like a...
[01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:36.420]  She looks like she's going...
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:36.680]  Russian fashion Barbie.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:37.660]  I think she's going skiing.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:38.240]  Yeah.
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.520]  Well, no hits yet.
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:41.220]  Still going.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:45.180]  Do you think there are more Barbie cards or more 007 cards?
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:46.100]  There's...
[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:46.840]  I don't think there's...
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:48.100]  Oh my god, there's a lot of Barbie cards.
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:49.160]  There's so many Barbie cards.
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:50.520]  I still don't think there's as many as 007.
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:51.660]  This box doesn't stop.
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:52.260]  Oof.
[01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:53.520]  We can save some.
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:54.580]  Yeah, whoa, don't worry.
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:56.900]  There's that Barbie.
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:57.640]  Uh-huh.
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:58.440]  All right.
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.020]  I wish they had names on the front.
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:00.720]  I know, I know.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:01.880]  Do they have names on the back?
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:04.480]  They have fashion facts.
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:04.820]  Oh.
[01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:05.480]  Oh, I'll tell you what.
[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:06.020]  Let's do a...
[01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:07.000]  Tell me what...
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.200]  Tell me one you're interested in and I'll give you more info.
[01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:10.300]  Okay.
[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:11.480]  Uh, there's that one.
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:12.440]  That one's nice.
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:13.820]  The other one was like Breakfast at Tiffany's.
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:14.580]  That one's interesting.
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:15.940]  This one or the Breakfast at Tiffany's one?
[01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:17.480]  I like the Breakfast at Tiffany's one, but that's just me.
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:17.600]  This one?
[01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:18.300]  Yeah, no, that's fine.
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:19.800]  Pretty as a picture.
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:20.380]  Uh-huh.
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:21.700]  Okay, I'll tell you a little bit about Barbie.
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:22.060]  Please.
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:24.000]  Here's a fashion fact about Barbie.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:26.700]  This Barbie fashion is a masterpiece of black and white style.
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.600]  Her sleeveless A-line dress has a black cotton top and a black white check taffeta skirt.
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:35.760]  White top stitching edges the neckline, details down the front of the bodice,
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:38.360]  and circles the waist, which is decorated with a rhinestone flower.
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:40.660]  Her clutch purse is black patent leather.
[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:41.380]  Tired.
[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:45.220]  And she wears a wide-brimmed black and white check hat and black high-heeled pumps.
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:45.740]  Barbie facts.
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:47.860]  Frances Fairchild is the cousin...
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:50.840]  Uh, Frances Fairchild is cousin Francie's full name.
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:52.160]  She is 15 years old.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:55.560]  And psychedelic paintings appear in galleries of modern art.
[01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:59.040]  Hey, anytime somebody's interested in a card, please don't read anything from the back of the card.
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:42:59.860]  Let's just do the facts.
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:00.700]  You don't want me to read?
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:01.940]  No, that was hell.
[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:02.600]  That was hell.
[01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:03.840]  That sucked.
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:04.400]  How about this?
[01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:07.520]  Out of Africa wins an Academy Award for Best Picture.
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:09.200]  What? What is happening?
[01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:10.700]  That's not a Barbie fact.
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:13.040]  Yuppie women create...
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:14.280]  Here's one.
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:16.820]  Yuppie women create a new fashion trend.
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:20.480]  They wear track shoes with business suits and bow ties to and from work.
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:21.840]  That's not how she's dressed.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:22.280]  No.
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:22.840]  She's very fancy.
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.400]  These are fun facts. They're not appropriate.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.780]  They're not relevant to anything we're looking at.
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:26.040]  No.
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:29.100]  Dustin Hoffman won Best Actor for his role as Raymond in Rayman.
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:31.080]  That's not Dustin Hoffman!
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:32.820]  What is this?
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:33.240]  Here's one.
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:38.800]  Sweet-scented Giorgio perfume is introduced at Giorgio, the exclusive shop on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:40.200]  She looks like she's going shopping.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:41.080]  I mean, that fits. That's fine.
[01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:41.880]  That works.
[01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:43.680]  Why is one of her eyes pulling down?
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:45.300]  It is.
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:45.700]  She's winking.
[01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:46.360]  Oh.
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:47.360]  Oh, yeah.
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:48.660]  She's probably got some Giorgio in her eyes.
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.940]  I think that might be the quail egg.
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:53.540]  She's like, I'm going shopping.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:57.020]  I need to meet with Giorgio. I have an appointment.
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:03.140]  Oh, My Fair Lady won the Academy Award for Best Movie.
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:03.440]  Oh.
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:04.880]  That looks...
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:05.980]  Okay. I mean, okay.
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:10.980]  The 1959 Academy Award for Best Picture goes to Ben-Hur. That's the year of that Barbie.
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:11.740]  That's not... ah.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.460]  The shortest of shorts...
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.580]  The shortest of shorts is called Hot Pants.
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:20.020]  Good to know.
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:21.780]  No, no, no.
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:28.440]  These are making me mad.
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:30.100]  Eric's getting legit angry.
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:33.140]  He asked Geoff to read that thing that's like from Word 2.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:35.500]  Eric was like, I'm fucking pissed.
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:38.120]  This sucks.
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:40.360]  I'm fucking furious.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:44.980]  This better be related to what the fuck she's wearing.
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:45.520]  It's not.
[01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:46.280]  Oh, my God.
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:48.260]  Music tapes hit the road...
[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:48.700]  What?
[01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:52.500]  ...in the first car cassette player.
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:54.340]  They're talking about the invention of the tape.
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:58.420]  And she's like, what the fuck is this?
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.660]  Little go-go boots.
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.300]  This one's irrelevant to you, Andrew.
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.500]  I'm going to guess it's from 1972.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:09.060]  Maybe the facts aren't appropriate to the year, but they don't always seem to be.
[01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:10.580]  So I don't know why that would be the case.
[01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:15.920]  Fun fact, Canadians now buy more color TVs than black and white ones.
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:18.300]  Congratulations, man.
[01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:21.320]  Made it.
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:27.640]  Next time you go get your hair cut, ask all the people there if they remember 1972 and buy a color TV.
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:29.380]  John F. Kennedy was president.
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:32.820]  Oh, here's another one for you, Andrew.
[01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:39.700]  More and more Canadian shoppers head for the new shopping malls, where they can find everything they need under one roof.
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:40.880]  That is a fun fact.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:43.140]  I got another fun fact.
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:44.960]  I got a fun fact about that card.
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:47.400]  That card also, that Barbie is not Joey Pants.
[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:53.360]  The Beatles released their latest movie.
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:56.600]  It's titled Help! in 1965.
[01:45:57.820 --> 01:45:58.640]  Still no hits.
[01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:00.400]  We'll do two more packs.
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:02.040]  We got ten minutes.
[01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:04.740]  Also what Eric was saying when Geoff was reading the back of the card.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:16.520]  Some in fashions for 1971 are the layered look, hemlines to the knees, and maxi skirts for the evening.
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.760]  And hot pants.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:19.700]  That's none of these...
[01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:21.920]  And hot pants.
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:23.780]  Oh, it did say that. I thought you were kidding.
[01:46:23.980 --> 01:46:25.240]  No, it said and hot pants.
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:30.240]  The Beatles revolutionized the world of rock and roll with their hit song, I Want to Hold Your Hand.
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:33.280]  That's fine, because that looks like it.
[01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:34.640]  She's putting her hand out to be held.
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:35.720]  Yeah, no, that makes sense.
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:40.060]  Did you know that Bonanza was the first TV show to be broadcast in color?
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:41.600]  You're going to love this Barbie card.
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:42.840]  She went fishing.
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:43.600]  What?
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:45.080]  She went fishing in a sombrero.
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:47.400]  Sombrero, fish, and Barbie.
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:48.140]  And she caught a fish.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:49.160]  She caught a angelfish.
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:51.020]  And you get to enjoy that until 1973.
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:53.380]  Those are found usually in lakes and rivers, yeah.
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:53.960]  Yeah.
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:56.360]  Okay, I'm going to save that one.
[01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:57.040]  What?
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:57.960]  I like that one.
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:46:58.320]  Why?
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:46:59.140]  I like it.
[01:46:59.460 --> 01:46:59.980]  Okay.
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.280]  Top 10 boys' names in 1970.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:02.900]  Anybody guess?
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:04.040]  John.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:04.920]  Michael.
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:05.580]  Rodney.
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:05.920]  Wayne.
[01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:06.580]  What?
[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:07.900]  Rodney?
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:09.400]  So...
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:10.880]  How many Rodneys do you know?
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:12.480]  So John and Michael were correct.
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:12.960]  Nice.
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:19.280]  Michael, David, John, Geoffrey, Robert, James, Christopher, Mark, Stephen, and Scott.
[01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:19.840]  No Rodney.
[01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:21.040]  No Bibbs.
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:21.500]  No Bibbs.
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:22.220]  No Bibbs.
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:23.240]  What?
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:28.280]  Billy Jean King is the first woman athlete in history to win more than $100,000 in a
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:28.760]  single year.
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:29.920]  Oof.
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:31.280]  We have come a long way since 1971.
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:36.800]  Wilma Rudolph, America's fastest female sprinter, owns three track and field gold medals at
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.740]  the Summer Olympics.
[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:38.960]  That's not an Olympics.
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:39.720]  And then she...
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.920]  She sang Happy Birthday to the President?
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:47.320]  The tallest building in the world is the Sears Tower in Chicago.
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:48.220]  No it's not.
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:51.500]  We're going to check on that fact.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:52.160]  That's incorrect.
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:54.300]  Barbie's heading for the slopes.
[01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:54.700]  She's going to ski.
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:55.140]  Yeah.
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:56.320]  This is the same Barbie.
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:58.220]  This is the year that Barbie had the big forehead.
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:47:59.800]  That's tough.
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:47:59.920]  Oh yeah.
[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:00.640]  That's tough for Barbie.
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:01.020]  Yeah.
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:01.620]  Oh yeah.
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:02.600]  Big brain Barbie.
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:02.940]  Yeah.
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:04.300]  And also very flat hair.
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:04.940]  Mm-hmm.
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:05.860]  Well, 70s I guess.
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:06.280]  It's a style.
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:07.620]  How come it's not feathered?
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:08.380]  That's true.
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:09.660]  Get some feathered look in there.
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:10.420]  That's true.
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.560]  Young Emily could have fixed it.
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.600]  Do we want to keep going with these facts?
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:16.880]  Doogie Howser, M.D.
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:17.600]  Let's start blasting.
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:18.980]  Is a TV series...
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:19.180]  Uh-huh.
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:21.040]  ...featuring a teenage genius...
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:21.600]  That's just...
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:27.060]  This is just describing Doogie Howser, and that is what 1989 did look like, so...
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:28.100]  Those look like her shoes.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.140]  Little pink pumps.
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:29.640]  There's other...
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:30.480]  One of them at least.
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:30.680]  Yeah.
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:32.100]  We got sort of a hit.
[01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:33.340]  Got a foot hit.
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.440]  That's what I'm all about.
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:36.460]  What?
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:37.120]  1998?
[01:48:37.820 --> 01:48:38.280]  What is this?
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:38.900]  What's happening?
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:40.100]  We're getting into the 80s.
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.200]  Yeah, like really.
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:41.740]  Took a turn.
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:44.660]  It was like 60s, 70s, and then we hit like 80s and early 90s.
[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:45.880]  This shit's fucking wacky.
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:50.600]  Well, I guess appropriate for the wacky dress and the time.
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:53.680]  Did you know that Whitney Houston topped the pop charts with How Will I Know?
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:55.060]  How will I know?
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:55.500]  It's a good...
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:55.920]  It's a great song.
[01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:57.060]  Even if he loves me.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.840]  She dances to that at Jazzercise.
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:48:59.860]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:03.040]  I can't see how they would love how I would be.
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:06.540]  Okay, There's That Barbie.
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:07.000]  Fantastic.
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:08.700]  There's That Barbie.
[01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:12.940]  Michael Jackson released a sizzling album called Thriller.
[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:13.340]  Okay.
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:17.160]  And Expensive Embroidery...
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:18.620]  I had trouble saying that word.
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:21.920]  Expensive Embroidery for the evening wear is fashionably in.
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.920]  Is that what she's wearing?
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:25.340]  Yeah.
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:26.100]  It's fashion.
[01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:28.020]  All right, last pack of Barbie.
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:29.460]  Yeah, fuck it.
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:29.700]  Why not?
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:30.780]  You got eight minutes.
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:31.580]  We haven't gotten a hit yet.
[01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:32.100]  No.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:33.480]  We got one shoe, maybe.
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:34.080]  Yeah.
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:34.960]  That's true.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:35.460]  We got a shoe.
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:36.240]  We did get a shoe.
[01:49:40.210 --> 01:49:44.650]  Out of everything, even if we don't get a hit, I really appreciate the Alvin and the Chipmunks
[01:49:45.050 --> 01:49:46.290]  case that you brought them in.
[01:49:46.450 --> 01:49:47.310]  It says...
[01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:48.350]  The runaway from home case?
[01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.570]  Yeah.
[01:49:48.570 --> 01:49:50.850]  It says grandma bound, too.
[01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:51.890]  Does it really?
[01:49:52.050 --> 01:49:53.750]  I don't know if that's what they were doing in the movie.
[01:49:53.790 --> 01:49:54.390]  I can't remember.
[01:49:54.610 --> 01:49:59.770]  There's something so nostalgic about the look of print on like really bright color to me
[01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:02.930]  that like makes me almost like homesick when I see that.
[01:50:03.010 --> 01:50:06.050]  And it says stuff like grandma bound or like things like that.
[01:50:06.410 --> 01:50:07.570]  That's just what I grew up with.
[01:50:07.610 --> 01:50:08.930]  The exact same style of thing.
[01:50:08.930 --> 01:50:09.350]  Aw, you miss home?
[01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:10.810]  Do you want to talk about those emotions?
[01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:11.210]  Are you about to cry?
[01:50:11.210 --> 01:50:11.910]  No, I don't think so.
[01:50:11.950 --> 01:50:12.310]  It's okay.
[01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:13.230]  Let it open up.
[01:50:13.370 --> 01:50:16.330]  I had a Simpsons backpack that makes me feel the same way.
[01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:17.070]  Tell us about...
[01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:18.230]  What's your favorite memory of your grandma?
[01:50:21.330 --> 01:50:23.790]  We dug in the backyard and found chicken bones.
[01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:26.090]  And she said they were dinosaur bones.
[01:50:26.210 --> 01:50:27.090]  And we were probably like five.
[01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:30.070]  And then we went inside and told my grandpa, look, we found all these dinosaur bones.
[01:50:30.130 --> 01:50:31.710]  And he went, what?
[01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:33.810]  And he's like, is your grandmother burying chickens again?
[01:50:34.050 --> 01:50:35.930]  Yeah, why was she burying all the chickens?
[01:50:36.610 --> 01:50:38.310]  Listen, she had chicken.
[01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:40.010]  Now that I'm thinking about it, she had chickens.
[01:50:42.630 --> 01:50:43.450]  There's that Barbie.
[01:50:44.010 --> 01:50:44.630]  And this Barbie.
[01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:49.510]  This Barbie likes bell-bottoms are fashion for men and women.
[01:50:49.770 --> 01:50:50.510]  She's not!
[01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:51.490]  That's not bell-bottoms.
[01:50:51.670 --> 01:50:52.430]  God, I'm so mad.
[01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.490]  This sucks.
[01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:57.730]  A midi versus mini fashion war rages among Canadian women.
[01:50:58.050 --> 01:50:58.350]  What?
[01:50:58.490 --> 01:50:59.490]  Is Barbie a Canadian?
[01:50:59.490 --> 01:51:00.390]  Is it a Canada thing?
[01:51:00.710 --> 01:51:02.050]  Hey, is Barbie Canadian, Andrew?
[01:51:02.050 --> 01:51:03.670]  I don't know, but this is in English and French.
[01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:05.590]  Oh, this might be a Canadian.
[01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:07.090]  Andrew, why don't you know this?
[01:51:07.090 --> 01:51:07.870]  Panini Canada.
[01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:08.510]  Yeah.
[01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:09.810]  Panini Canada?
[01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:12.330]  This is localized to Canada, I guess.
[01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:13.490]  Panini Canada?
[01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.610]  What does that mean?
[01:51:14.610 --> 01:51:16.050]  Like a panini.
[01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:19.650]  Like the Canadian division of panini.
[01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:21.690]  Oh, I see.
[01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:22.730]  The company is called Panini.
[01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:27.810]  I thought maybe there was like a food thing or a city called Panini.
[01:51:29.170 --> 01:51:30.250]  Where are you from?
[01:51:30.530 --> 01:51:32.370]  Barbie City, famously called Panini.
[01:51:32.730 --> 01:51:33.710]  Everybody knows this.
[01:51:33.730 --> 01:51:35.050]  So it's Panini Italy, right?
[01:51:35.170 --> 01:51:36.390]  That's where Joey Panoloni is from.
[01:51:38.330 --> 01:51:39.370]  There's that Barbie.
[01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:40.150]  Joey Panoloni.
[01:51:40.410 --> 01:51:40.950]  Panoloni.
[01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:44.150]  Joey Panoloni.
[01:51:44.610 --> 01:51:45.970]  Is that more fun to say?
[01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:52.070]  Oh my God.
[01:51:52.810 --> 01:51:53.570]  I'm going to be honest.
[01:51:53.650 --> 01:51:54.910]  This probably looks kind of like an asshole.
[01:51:56.570 --> 01:51:57.570]  I'm not feeling that.
[01:51:57.570 --> 01:51:58.030]  That's awesome.
[01:51:58.290 --> 01:52:00.390]  That is a fucking stuck up Barbie right there.
[01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.730]  That's cool.
[01:52:02.130 --> 01:52:02.550]  Well...
[01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:03.750]  No hits, but good Barbies.
[01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:04.370]  We got four.
[01:52:05.170 --> 01:52:12.930]  I'm a fan of the deep sea angelfish sombrero wearing Barbie.
[01:52:13.170 --> 01:52:13.690]  That's a good one.
[01:52:13.690 --> 01:52:15.810]  That's probably one of the best Barbies.
[01:52:15.810 --> 01:52:18.890]  I'll let you hold on to these until I take a hit.
[01:52:19.190 --> 01:52:23.670]  Should we, for Eric's case, open up on the way out an Umbrella Academy?
[01:52:25.530 --> 01:52:26.490]  Wow, two.
[01:52:26.850 --> 01:52:30.530]  In honor of Eric, we'll end the episode.
[01:52:31.170 --> 01:52:35.210]  In honor of Eric and Rebecca, we will end the episode on Umbrella Academy.
[01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.930]  Everybody's favorite.
[01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:37.110]  Great.
[01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:39.970]  We only see each other on Wednesdays.
[01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:42.410]  Can't wait to see this guy's fucking big arms or whatever.
[01:52:42.710 --> 01:52:43.450]  I remember that.
[01:52:43.450 --> 01:52:44.750]  I remember that card.
[01:52:45.730 --> 01:52:47.070]  Ch-ch-changes.
[01:52:47.630 --> 01:52:48.910]  I remember this card, too.
[01:52:49.110 --> 01:52:49.750]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:50.390]  Is she holding an umbrella?
[01:52:51.110 --> 01:52:52.510]  Yeah, well, they're inside the Academy.
[01:52:52.890 --> 01:52:53.530]  Holy shit, guys.
[01:52:53.650 --> 01:52:54.430]  Look at this, though.
[01:52:54.510 --> 01:52:55.730]  It's bad luck, though, to do that.
[01:52:56.290 --> 01:52:58.530]  Fucking on-card auto of grace.
[01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.390]  Wow!
[01:52:59.750 --> 01:53:00.370]  She's the mom.
[01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:01.510]  Jordan Claire Robbins.
[01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.650]  That's cool.
[01:53:03.170 --> 01:53:04.150]  That's a fucking hit.
[01:53:04.190 --> 01:53:04.830]  On-card auto.
[01:53:06.610 --> 01:53:08.750]  We only see each other at weddings and funerals.
[01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:09.990]  Is that on all of them?
[01:53:10.110 --> 01:53:10.570]  It's on all...
[01:53:10.570 --> 01:53:11.090]  I think it's from...
[01:53:11.090 --> 01:53:11.750]  I think it's the episode.
[01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:13.230]  It's from...
[01:53:13.230 --> 01:53:14.530]  What else is she known for?
[01:53:14.670 --> 01:53:15.290]  Umbrella Academy.
[01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:16.310]  Man on the Moon.
[01:53:16.670 --> 01:53:17.870]  If you believe.
[01:53:18.670 --> 01:53:19.610]  What's in that briefcase?
[01:53:20.630 --> 01:53:22.190]  Uh, Marcellus Wallace's soul.
[01:53:22.370 --> 01:53:23.110]  What's on his shorts?
[01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:26.330]  Also Marcellus Wallace's soul.
[01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.610]  Yeah.
[01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:30.410]  There's that one.
[01:53:30.610 --> 01:53:31.530]  And then this one.
[01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:33.290]  Is that Mary J. Blige?
[01:53:33.410 --> 01:53:34.030]  Yeah, that's Mary J. Blige.
[01:53:34.190 --> 01:53:36.130]  She's one of the actresses in the movie.
[01:53:36.370 --> 01:53:36.550]  That's cool.
[01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:37.110]  The TV show.
[01:53:37.250 --> 01:53:37.350]  Yeah.
[01:53:37.670 --> 01:53:38.990]  And then there's that one.
[01:53:39.570 --> 01:53:40.210]  Congratulations, Eric.
[01:53:40.210 --> 01:53:40.710]  You gotta...
[01:53:40.710 --> 01:53:41.350]  What are they looking at?
[01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.730]  You gotta see...
[01:53:41.730 --> 01:53:42.590]  The only otto of the day.
[01:53:42.850 --> 01:53:44.090]  The big umbrella above them.
[01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.450]  Yeah.
[01:53:44.610 --> 01:53:46.230]  You can see that guy's...
[01:53:46.230 --> 01:53:47.050]  There's holes in this umbrella.
[01:53:47.490 --> 01:53:49.550]  See that guy's like big shoulders or whatever for his big arms.
[01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.690]  Oh, right.
[01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.990]  Look at the fucking sleeve of this.
[01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:52.850]  Show that guy's chin.
[01:53:53.470 --> 01:53:53.910]  Which one?
[01:53:54.150 --> 01:53:54.810]  The one on the right?
[01:53:54.930 --> 01:53:55.450]  In the back right?
[01:53:55.630 --> 01:53:55.790]  Yeah.
[01:53:55.930 --> 01:53:56.150]  Yeah.
[01:53:56.250 --> 01:53:56.670]  I don't know.
[01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:57.810]  I think maybe he's excited.
[01:53:59.450 --> 01:54:00.150]  It looks prosthetic.
[01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:01.830]  No.
[01:54:02.230 --> 01:54:02.690]  Chin, man.
[01:54:02.970 --> 01:54:03.790]  Looks like a fake chin.
[01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:05.310]  One guy's got big arms.
[01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:06.150]  The other guy's got a big chin.
[01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:07.690]  Everybody got something.
[01:54:08.670 --> 01:54:09.490]  That's the whole point of it.
[01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:11.370]  All right.
[01:54:12.130 --> 01:54:12.690]  I guess.
[01:54:13.570 --> 01:54:14.490]  Man, it was a good day.
[01:54:14.630 --> 01:54:15.410]  It was a good break.
[01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:17.050]  But we didn't get a single fucking Zimmer.
[01:54:17.290 --> 01:54:17.470]  Nope.
[01:54:18.150 --> 01:54:19.390]  Gotta say I'm bummed about that.
[01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:19.630]  Yep.
[01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:22.450]  Do you think it's a different set?
[01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:24.550]  I don't know.
[01:54:24.630 --> 01:54:25.050]  Or is it me?
[01:54:25.130 --> 01:54:25.670]  Am I bad luck?
[01:54:25.730 --> 01:54:26.570]  No, it's not you.
[01:54:26.650 --> 01:54:27.870]  Well, we didn't have it on the last one.
[01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:28.910]  Yeah, we didn't get it last time either.
[01:54:29.210 --> 01:54:30.250]  So it's definitely not you.
[01:54:31.050 --> 01:54:32.050]  We'll find a pattern to it.
[01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:32.310]  Find the pineapple.
[01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:34.050]  What's that?
[01:54:34.230 --> 01:54:34.770]  Pineapple's the...
[01:54:34.770 --> 01:54:35.850]  Pineapple back to back.
[01:54:35.950 --> 01:54:36.630]  Could be a pineapple thing.
[01:54:36.630 --> 01:54:37.690]  It could be a pineapple problem.
[01:54:37.730 --> 01:54:39.190]  We have had two pineapples back to back.
[01:54:39.190 --> 01:54:40.270]  What is the pineapple for?
[01:54:41.110 --> 01:54:41.910]  That's a great question.
[01:54:42.650 --> 01:54:43.690]  That is a great question, Gavin.
[01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:44.290]  Thank you for asking.
[01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:45.610]  I'll tell you what.
[01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:48.870]  What if we'll go out with...
[01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:50.610]  Maybe there's one big one here.
[01:54:50.890 --> 01:54:52.210]  Yeah, I'm trying to find a...
[01:54:52.210 --> 01:54:53.310]  One last chance at a Zimmer.
[01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:54.130]  Are you allowed to do that?
[01:54:54.670 --> 01:54:54.970]  No.
[01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:56.330]  I make the rules.
[01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.930]  I break the rules.
[01:54:57.110 --> 01:54:57.650]  That's true.
[01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:58.070]  I mean...
[01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:59.110]  One last chance at a Zimmer.
[01:54:59.210 --> 01:54:59.890]  I'm not stopping you.
[01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:02.150]  What if this is a late game Zimmer?
[01:55:02.890 --> 01:55:03.690]  1991 tops.
[01:55:04.490 --> 01:55:05.010]  How long we got?
[01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.370]  Two minutes?
[01:55:05.610 --> 01:55:05.850]  Yep.
[01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:07.230]  Let's rip a Zimmer.
[01:55:07.230 --> 01:55:07.770]  Let's rip a Zim.
[01:55:07.770 --> 01:55:08.010]  Let's do it.
[01:55:08.150 --> 01:55:08.930]  Let's rip a Zim.
[01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.750]  Here we go.
[01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:11.870]  All right, here we go.
[01:55:12.450 --> 01:55:12.910]  No.
[01:55:13.290 --> 01:55:14.090]  Andy Lee, no.
[01:55:14.530 --> 01:55:15.630]  Geoff Schaefer, no.
[01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:17.510]  Connie Langsford, uh...
[01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:18.610]  Cool glasses.
[01:55:18.610 --> 01:55:19.550]  That's a funny card, though.
[01:55:19.690 --> 01:55:20.150]  We'll figure it out.
[01:55:20.150 --> 01:55:20.850]  Yeah, that's a Photoshop.
[01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:21.450]  Randy Velarde.
[01:55:22.190 --> 01:55:23.110]  Frank Lills.
[01:55:23.710 --> 01:55:24.570]  Wow, his arm.
[01:55:24.610 --> 01:55:25.090]  Backwards arm.
[01:55:25.250 --> 01:55:25.830]  Backwards arm.
[01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:27.090]  Yeah, didn't look good, right?
[01:55:27.090 --> 01:55:27.510]  So much.
[01:55:27.690 --> 01:55:28.250]  Joe Price.
[01:55:28.570 --> 01:55:29.250]  Gary Ward.
[01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:30.810]  Uh...
[01:55:30.810 --> 01:55:32.010]  Ronnie Walden.
[01:55:32.890 --> 01:55:33.810]  Nolan Ryan.
[01:55:34.050 --> 01:55:34.590]  That's a hit.
[01:55:35.170 --> 01:55:36.010]  Bobby Thigpen.
[01:55:36.610 --> 01:55:37.610]  Danny Darwin.
[01:55:38.810 --> 01:55:39.310]  Thigpen?
[01:55:39.650 --> 01:55:39.830]  Yeah.
[01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:40.250]  Like Pigpen?
[01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.930]  Yeah, Thigpen.
[01:55:41.370 --> 01:55:42.070]  Danny Darwin.
[01:55:42.890 --> 01:55:43.390]  Uh...
[01:55:43.390 --> 01:55:44.090]  Gerald Young.
[01:55:45.010 --> 01:55:46.170]  Oh, fucking Tony Gwynn!
[01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:46.690]  Hey!
[01:55:47.210 --> 01:55:47.470]  I think I'm that one.
[01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:48.650]  Most famous padre of all time, probably.
[01:55:48.670 --> 01:55:48.910]  Absolutely.
[01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:49.850]  Rick Aguilera.
[01:55:50.150 --> 01:55:51.630]  And, uh...
[01:55:51.630 --> 01:55:52.190]  Who's this?
[01:55:53.410 --> 01:55:54.510]  Oh, Kevin Mass.
[01:55:54.770 --> 01:55:55.130]  Damn.
[01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:55.590]  Damn.
[01:55:56.130 --> 01:55:56.530]  Nope.
[01:55:57.190 --> 01:55:57.690]  So...
[01:55:57.690 --> 01:55:58.670]  Still no Zim.
[01:55:58.790 --> 01:56:00.430]  Two weeks, two episodes in a row.
[01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:00.990]  But that's okay.
[01:56:01.050 --> 01:56:02.290]  We got a bunch of other hits.
[01:56:02.730 --> 01:56:03.950]  Boy, did we have fun.
[01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:06.750]  Thanks for tuning in for another episode of Fuck, Face, Break, Shit.
[01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:13.690]  Special thanks to Emily, my lovely girlfriend, for coming and putting up with us and pulling
[01:56:13.690 --> 01:56:14.590]  your Barbies out of storage.
[01:56:14.670 --> 01:56:15.510]  Really appreciate that.
[01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:19.330]  Also, you're instantly more adept at that than Gavin.
[01:56:20.010 --> 01:56:21.170]  Can't thank you enough for that.
[01:56:21.570 --> 01:56:22.350]  And, uh...
[01:56:23.050 --> 01:56:25.030]  Gotta say, disappointed in Jack, yet again.
[01:56:25.250 --> 01:56:25.450]  Yep.
[01:56:25.970 --> 01:56:26.410]  Aww.
[01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:28.290]  I don't know what it's gonna take.
[01:56:29.390 --> 01:56:30.110]  Farm League fan.
[01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:32.630]  Mmm, he's going even lower, damn.
[01:56:32.630 --> 01:56:33.670]  Farm League Jack, yeah.
[01:56:33.670 --> 01:56:35.030]  Why don't we do one at his house?
[01:56:36.710 --> 01:56:37.930]  I mean, I don't want to go to his house.
[01:56:37.930 --> 01:56:38.530]  We may have to.
[01:56:38.730 --> 01:56:39.350]  Is that...
[01:56:39.670 --> 01:56:40.590]  You've never been to his house?
[01:56:40.690 --> 01:56:41.050]  Nuh-uh.
[01:56:41.230 --> 01:56:42.090]  Do I want to go to his house?
[01:56:42.590 --> 01:56:42.870]  Sure.
[01:56:43.110 --> 01:56:43.370]  Okay.
[01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:44.050]  It's good parties.
[01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:45.530]  All right, we'll do the next one at Jack's house.
[01:56:45.610 --> 01:56:46.770]  You know who else has never been to Jack's house?
[01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:48.350]  I've never been to Jack's house.
[01:56:49.650 --> 01:56:50.290]  In my life.
[01:56:50.450 --> 01:56:53.110]  Wasn't there a thing that he built, like with the roses and stuff?
[01:56:53.690 --> 01:56:54.010]  Trellis.
[01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.590]  Trellis.
[01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:56.730]  Yeah, we can go take trellis photos for Andrew.
[01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:59.970]  Well, next episode we'll be doing the card rips at Jack's trellis, so thanks for watching.
[01:56:59.970 --> 01:57:00.410]  Live from the trellis.
[01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:01.650]  Live from the trellis.
[01:57:01.650 --> 01:57:02.370]  Or not.
[01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.730]  Yep.
[01:57:03.450 --> 01:57:04.150]  Okay, say bye.
[01:57:04.290 --> 01:57:04.910]  Have a good weekend!
[01:57:07.290 --> 01:57:07.730]  Okay.
[01:57:07.930 --> 01:57:08.170]  Goodbye!
[01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:09.650]  Bye.
