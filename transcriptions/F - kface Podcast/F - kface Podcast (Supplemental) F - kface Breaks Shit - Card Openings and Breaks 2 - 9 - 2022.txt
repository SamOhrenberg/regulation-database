[00:31.440 --> 00:33.080]  One. Andrew, action.
[00:33.600 --> 00:34.240]  Go, Andrew.
[00:34.480 --> 00:35.960]  Andrew, action.
[00:36.840 --> 00:37.480]  Action what?
[00:37.780 --> 00:39.680]  I don't know. We're looking at a little screen that's black.
[00:40.640 --> 00:42.020]  Oh, I can see the table.
[00:42.400 --> 00:47.200]  Actually, Don Zimmer is getting his head rubbed by a guy about to throw him.
[00:47.560 --> 00:51.260]  There's a bat. Shaq is there. I don't know who the leprechaun is.
[00:51.660 --> 00:53.720]  Don Zimmer has a bear. There's a skateboard.
[00:54.820 --> 00:58.040]  I just realized I'm describing what you can see on the black screen.
[00:58.040 --> 01:01.040]  It actually has no impact on...
[01:02.820 --> 01:04.960]  Am I good? Can I do it?
[01:05.080 --> 01:06.100]  Yeah, that's good. And now you start.
[01:06.520 --> 01:10.620]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of Fuck Face...
[01:10.620 --> 01:12.820]  Sorry, Face Break Shit.
[01:13.780 --> 01:14.480]  You got me there.
[01:14.800 --> 01:17.860]  With me, as always, producer extraordinaire, Eric.
[01:18.060 --> 01:18.220]  Hello.
[01:18.480 --> 01:21.400]  Emily, the new sound board operator.
[01:21.580 --> 01:23.620]  Gavin got parallel promotion.
[01:23.880 --> 01:25.600]  We parallel promoted him right off the fucking show.
[01:26.580 --> 01:27.420]  He's not here.
[01:27.780 --> 01:31.840]  And then always with us in spirit and in voice, Andrew Panton.
[01:32.340 --> 01:33.320]  How you feeling, Andrew?
[01:34.080 --> 01:35.320]  I feel great. How do you feel?
[01:35.400 --> 01:37.040]  I feel pretty tired.
[01:37.640 --> 01:40.380]  We had an early day, late night yesterday.
[01:41.680 --> 01:42.860]  Is that something we can talk about?
[01:43.080 --> 01:46.380]  I mean, if you want to. I don't see a reason why we can't.
[01:47.020 --> 01:48.860]  Well, so we...
[01:48.860 --> 01:51.840]  Maybe we should wait until the supplemental content comes out to explain it.
[01:52.500 --> 01:55.200]  None of this matters. Just say what it is.
[01:55.200 --> 01:56.100]  I think we need to explain.
[01:56.580 --> 01:59.360]  We had to record a bunch of episodes of Fuck...
[02:00.220 --> 02:00.660]  ...Face.
[02:01.660 --> 02:04.440]  Because Gavin's got some other shit to do, as always.
[02:07.260 --> 02:13.160]  So we got into an argument, which ended up getting recorded as supplemental content, which will come out.
[02:14.120 --> 02:15.240]  About when to record.
[02:15.340 --> 02:19.680]  We decided on 8 a.m. yesterday and then 11 p.m. yesterday.
[02:19.840 --> 02:20.000]  Yeah.
[02:20.280 --> 02:23.500]  So we recorded a podcast at 8 a.m. and then again at 11 p.m.
[02:23.500 --> 02:25.680]  And the 11 p.m. podcast did not go well.
[02:28.600 --> 02:30.940]  The 11 p.m. podcast...
[02:30.940 --> 02:31.360]  Tempers were short.
[02:31.440 --> 02:32.440]  I don't want to spoil anything.
[02:32.460 --> 02:33.200]  Energy was low.
[02:33.400 --> 02:36.600]  At one point, Geoff says that he's doing the podcast with his eyes closed.
[02:36.780 --> 02:38.540]  And that props somebody else to do that.
[02:38.660 --> 02:41.420]  And you can feel the energy leave the show.
[02:42.100 --> 02:42.400]  Yeah.
[02:42.760 --> 02:44.780]  One of us can still talk with our eyes closed.
[02:45.160 --> 02:46.140]  One of us cannot.
[02:46.660 --> 02:50.540]  It's like putting a sheet over a birdcage.
[02:51.240 --> 02:52.440]  Gavin just goes right out.
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.720]  I think genuinely 80 seconds into the show, I asked a question to which you replied,
[02:59.860 --> 03:01.740]  Geoff, I'm Googling a thing I don't give a fuck about.
[03:03.260 --> 03:07.560]  Like we just started at zero and it only got lower somehow.
[03:07.780 --> 03:09.320]  And then I had to get up this morning.
[03:09.460 --> 03:13.700]  Eric and I filmed a new podcast today for a new thing we're doing that won't come out forever.
[03:14.300 --> 03:16.280]  You told me we filmed a podcast that's not going to come out until May.
[03:16.420 --> 03:19.020]  I don't have a choice about when the fuck this shit comes out.
[03:19.100 --> 03:21.700]  I'm not complaining to you. I'm complaining with you.
[03:21.760 --> 03:22.080]  Oh.
[03:22.080 --> 03:23.000]  I'm commiserating.
[03:23.060 --> 03:24.140]  I wasn't complaining about when it came out.
[03:24.140 --> 03:24.820]  I wasn't attacking you.
[03:25.880 --> 03:27.740]  Sorry, I'm just used to it.
[03:28.100 --> 03:28.780]  Yeah, no, I get it.
[03:29.060 --> 03:31.280]  And then, I forgot we had to do the fucking Super Bowl thing.
[03:32.440 --> 03:35.240]  I feel like I've been talking for 24 straight hours.
[03:35.560 --> 03:38.040]  And I have to get a fucking group come out next week.
[03:38.500 --> 03:39.980]  And I'm on pain beds and it hurts.
[03:40.140 --> 03:41.440]  The only thing that hurts is talking.
[03:41.600 --> 03:42.620]  And so that's all I've done.
[03:43.380 --> 03:43.640]  Yeah.
[03:45.080 --> 03:46.540]  So anyway, let's open some cards.
[03:46.720 --> 03:46.860]  Yeah.
[03:47.200 --> 03:49.340]  So, set's a little sparse this week.
[03:49.720 --> 03:53.160]  We were not supposed to film here, but because of the Super Bowl thing, we came back.
[03:53.380 --> 03:53.700]  Touchdown.
[03:53.880 --> 03:54.400]  Next break show...
[03:57.240 --> 03:59.360]  Next face break show, we will...
[03:59.400 --> 04:00.720]  I did the... but I forgot to say that.
[04:00.720 --> 04:01.260]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:02.660 --> 04:04.140]  We'll be on our new permanent set.
[04:04.260 --> 04:04.320]  Yes.
[04:04.320 --> 04:06.980]  And we won't have to bring this shit from home every week and set it up.
[04:07.100 --> 04:07.760]  Because it's fucking annoying.
[04:08.280 --> 04:10.280]  Okay, we got a lot of stuff to cover this week.
[04:10.340 --> 04:12.460]  A lot of stuff. There's no way we're going to get to a tenth of it.
[04:14.420 --> 04:17.780]  But let's start off the way we do, by going into the pack sack.
[04:17.820 --> 04:18.180]  Sack pack.
[04:18.180 --> 04:19.280]  Pack sack.
[04:20.080 --> 04:21.500]  Reading what it says.
[04:21.860 --> 04:23.960]  Oh, interesting.
[04:24.280 --> 04:29.400]  The first pack of cards we're going to open up today is Youngblood.
[04:29.420 --> 04:34.620]  If you're not familiar with Youngblood, this guy, Rob Liefeld, made a Levi Jeans commercial.
[04:35.320 --> 04:41.000]  Then he became incredibly popular, was an artist for the New Mutants in Marvel in the 90s.
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.940]  Then he became the first comic book artist superstar, very briefly.
[04:47.120 --> 04:48.700]  Which is weird, because he couldn't draw ankles to save his life.
[04:49.840 --> 04:54.440]  And then he took all the other good artists and said, let's leave and start our own company.
[04:54.860 --> 04:55.940]  And they started Image Comics.
[04:56.160 --> 05:01.140]  Youngblood was the comic he made, eventually, because they couldn't get shit done on time.
[05:01.280 --> 05:02.540]  It turned out to be a giant clusterfuck.
[05:02.620 --> 05:04.320]  Yeah, it was pretty gnarly.
[05:04.940 --> 05:06.380]  But, we can get some Youngblood prism.
[05:06.500 --> 05:10.000]  That is the look, if you're a fan of comics now and did not read a lot of stuff in the 90s,
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  that's how everything looked in the 90s.
[05:12.880 --> 05:14.160]  It was terrible.
[05:14.660 --> 05:15.440]  Weird ankles.
[05:15.740 --> 05:17.780]  So, is that guy Youngblood on the cover?
[05:18.260 --> 05:19.100]  Youngblood was a team.
[05:19.360 --> 05:23.100]  Youngblood is the team of all these heroes.
[05:23.380 --> 05:26.240]  This guy looks a lot like Hawkeye from the Avengers, but he's not.
[05:26.320 --> 05:27.700]  Okay, so that's an arrow that he's holding?
[05:28.000 --> 05:28.500]  I think so.
[05:28.520 --> 05:29.740]  It looks like a marshmallow on fire.
[05:29.840 --> 05:32.100]  Yeah, it's a marshmallow on fire. It's a very weird...
[05:32.100 --> 05:32.480]  S'mores.
[05:32.640 --> 05:34.320]  Yeah, it's a weird thing.
[05:34.400 --> 05:36.480]  I tried to read Youngblood, but it was hard because it didn't come out.
[05:36.480 --> 05:39.780]  Okay, here's that dude.
[05:40.000 --> 05:40.960]  His name is Shaft.
[05:41.660 --> 05:42.020]  Shaft?
[05:42.060 --> 05:42.960]  Yeah, it's an arrow.
[05:42.980 --> 05:43.220]  That's Shaft?
[05:43.300 --> 05:44.100]  Iron Man 2?
[05:44.300 --> 05:45.160]  His name is Shaft.
[05:45.180 --> 05:45.860]  I think?
[05:45.860 --> 05:47.260]  Well, the guy who was holding the arrow.
[05:47.560 --> 05:48.040]  Oh, okay.
[05:48.740 --> 05:49.460]  That's literally...
[05:49.460 --> 05:50.880]  Give me a second to figure out what I was looking at here.
[05:50.880 --> 05:53.180]  I can't make heads or tails of this...
[05:53.180 --> 05:53.560]  Oh, is that his ass?
[05:53.560 --> 05:54.560]  This card is all tails.
[05:54.640 --> 05:55.020]  Oh, that's it.
[05:55.020 --> 05:55.660]  That's an ass.
[05:56.100 --> 05:57.300]  That's that guy's ass.
[05:58.020 --> 05:58.480]  Uh-huh.
[05:58.700 --> 05:59.480]  Here is...
[06:00.200 --> 06:01.180]  Is that the front?
[06:01.260 --> 06:02.340]  Oh, that's his ass.
[06:02.420 --> 06:03.020]  That's his...
[06:03.020 --> 06:03.840]  Yeah, the front.
[06:03.840 --> 06:04.660]  Real little ankles.
[06:04.780 --> 06:05.300]  That's his chest ass.
[06:05.300 --> 06:06.160]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:06.280 --> 06:06.640]  That's...
[06:06.640 --> 06:06.760]  Yeah.
[06:06.900 --> 06:09.240]  Here's somebody pushing a kid downstairs.
[06:09.700 --> 06:09.900]  That seems...
[06:09.900 --> 06:11.100]  He might be trying to save him.
[06:11.140 --> 06:11.660]  You know?
[06:11.940 --> 06:12.240]  Sure.
[06:12.900 --> 06:13.080]  Sure.
[06:13.260 --> 06:13.980]  I tried to save him.
[06:14.100 --> 06:14.380]  I swear.
[06:15.640 --> 06:16.460]  Here's two other characters.
[06:16.460 --> 06:18.080]  This is just how everything looked.
[06:18.200 --> 06:18.380]  Yeah.
[06:18.500 --> 06:19.040]  It sucked.
[06:19.040 --> 06:20.760]  Here's a dude who looks like that.
[06:21.300 --> 06:23.620]  Here's a whole team of assholes that looks like Domino.
[06:24.040 --> 06:25.160]  Everybody looks like somebody, right?
[06:25.240 --> 06:25.500]  Yeah.
[06:25.680 --> 06:26.440]  That's Bishop.
[06:27.160 --> 06:27.880]  There's Deadpool.
[06:28.880 --> 06:29.600]  Or Deadshot.
[06:30.180 --> 06:30.900]  That's Domino.
[06:31.060 --> 06:34.060]  And then that's Hawkeye from the Avengers West Coast.
[06:34.060 --> 06:37.260]  And then that's Jubilee over there.
[06:37.960 --> 06:39.160]  There's the Brown Hulk.
[06:40.800 --> 06:41.280]  There's...
[06:41.280 --> 06:42.380]  That's not Wolverine.
[06:42.600 --> 06:46.100]  That's a dude who looks a whole lot like Wolverine.
[06:47.000 --> 06:48.080]  And then that's...
[06:48.780 --> 06:49.160]  Wow.
[06:49.440 --> 06:49.860]  It's like...
[06:50.480 --> 06:51.340]  Black Punisher.
[06:51.560 --> 06:53.740]  It's really like if the Punisher went further.
[06:54.040 --> 06:54.220]  Yeah.
[06:54.440 --> 06:55.280]  It really is like...
[06:55.280 --> 06:56.060]  It's like extra Punisher.
[06:56.200 --> 06:58.560]  I'd put a skull on my shirt, but put a skull on my face.
[06:59.220 --> 06:59.580]  There you go.
[06:59.620 --> 07:00.380]  We didn't get any prisms.
[07:01.320 --> 07:02.280]  Oh, no.
[07:02.340 --> 07:02.760]  Oh, no.
[07:04.520 --> 07:05.660]  What are you doing?
[07:07.400 --> 07:08.660]  Why are you knocking over to Zim?
[07:09.140 --> 07:09.700]  Zim Bear.
[07:10.420 --> 07:13.000]  Over under the most valuable Youngblood card, 50 cents.
[07:14.660 --> 07:15.380]  Oh, under.
[07:15.540 --> 07:15.740]  Under.
[07:16.400 --> 07:17.260]  Oh, you know what?
[07:17.340 --> 07:19.340]  I was gonna start a new thing this week.
[07:19.420 --> 07:20.880]  I'm gonna pick like what is our...
[07:20.880 --> 07:22.540]  We're gonna try to have like the hit of the episode.
[07:22.900 --> 07:23.060]  Okay.
[07:23.220 --> 07:24.600]  So we're gonna have to pick one of these.
[07:24.660 --> 07:26.380]  Well, the ass is the best one on this one, right?
[07:26.900 --> 07:27.200]  The ass is the best card so far.
[07:27.200 --> 07:28.320]  So that's our hit right now.
[07:28.420 --> 07:28.860]  I think that's...
[07:28.860 --> 07:30.420]  That's our top card of the day.
[07:30.460 --> 07:32.060]  Yeah, unfortunately so far that's the top card.
[07:32.760 --> 07:33.560]  It's also a bottom.
[07:36.840 --> 07:37.500]  Thank you.
[07:38.780 --> 07:39.180]  Thank you.
[07:39.320 --> 07:39.700]  Thank you.
[07:39.840 --> 07:40.460]  Let's see what else we got.
[07:40.740 --> 07:42.200]  Tony gave me some stuff.
[07:42.380 --> 07:43.020]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[07:43.300 --> 07:44.480]  Our friend Tony who's...
[07:44.480 --> 07:45.120]  It's a Tony tub.
[07:45.280 --> 07:48.340]  Tony's treats from Face Jam, you might recognize.
[07:48.480 --> 07:50.420]  He also gave us some stuff for Fuck Face.
[07:50.580 --> 07:51.920]  He's an avid collector of things.
[07:52.320 --> 07:54.440]  Baseball's greatest gross outs he gave me.
[07:58.140 --> 08:00.060]  How do you get your arm like that?
[08:01.200 --> 08:02.760]  Oh, that's actually kind of what...
[08:03.440 --> 08:05.280]  It's kind of like what Blaine looks like right now, huh?
[08:05.380 --> 08:05.540]  Yeah.
[08:06.500 --> 08:09.020]  It's like the dude in that M. Night Shyamalan movie.
[08:09.100 --> 08:09.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[08:09.760 --> 08:10.360]  It's pretty cool.
[08:10.960 --> 08:12.800]  Oh, that's like Alan the alien.
[08:12.940 --> 08:13.340]  That's fun.
[08:13.420 --> 08:14.140]  Alan the alien.
[08:14.520 --> 08:15.100]  That's a fun one.
[08:16.000 --> 08:16.720]  He's a...
[08:16.720 --> 08:17.200]  He's an alien.
[08:17.420 --> 08:18.080]  Yeah, he's Alan.
[08:19.060 --> 08:19.420]  Okay.
[08:19.760 --> 08:20.480]  Oh, there we go.
[08:20.600 --> 08:21.240]  Ryan the rhino.
[08:21.260 --> 08:22.660]  You gotta stop knocking over Zim.
[08:23.320 --> 08:24.020]  He goes in there.
[08:24.100 --> 08:24.320]  Okay.
[08:24.820 --> 08:25.360]  That's good.
[08:25.640 --> 08:26.580]  Sniffing Shaq's butt.
[08:26.920 --> 08:27.540]  Ryan the...
[08:27.540 --> 08:28.600]  Peek-a-boo, Paul!
[08:28.600 --> 08:29.860]  None of these are gross.
[08:30.020 --> 08:30.540]  That's pretty gross.
[08:30.540 --> 08:30.960]  That's pretty gross.
[08:31.080 --> 08:32.060]  That rhino had three eyes?
[08:32.540 --> 08:33.460]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[08:33.640 --> 08:33.740]  Yeah.
[08:34.780 --> 08:35.100]  Why...
[08:35.100 --> 08:35.960]  This is Elvis pelvis.
[08:36.200 --> 08:36.380]  Uh-huh.
[08:36.680 --> 08:37.340]  But there's no pelvis.
[08:37.620 --> 08:40.400]  No, but he's got hair like Elvis I think is supposed to be like the thing.
[08:40.860 --> 08:41.640]  Yeah, but don't you think...
[08:41.640 --> 08:41.900]  Okay.
[08:42.120 --> 08:43.940]  So the whole drawing here is just...
[08:43.940 --> 08:44.200]  Skinny Vinny.
[08:44.400 --> 08:45.240]  Is just weird eyes.
[08:45.360 --> 08:45.980]  That's like all that...
[08:45.980 --> 08:46.540]  That's what they do.
[08:46.700 --> 08:46.860]  This might be better.
[08:46.860 --> 08:47.420]  That's pretty good.
[08:47.600 --> 08:48.800]  I'm gonna put this in as a...
[08:48.800 --> 08:49.480]  Let's see what you guys think.
[08:49.560 --> 08:50.000]  Uh-huh.
[08:51.740 --> 08:52.380]  Loosehead Melvin.
[08:53.420 --> 08:54.080]  That's pretty good.
[08:54.200 --> 08:55.200]  Might be better than the ass.
[08:55.460 --> 08:56.160]  These cards suck.
[08:56.160 --> 08:57.380]  They're just eyeballs.
[08:57.560 --> 08:58.560]  This is just eyeballs.
[08:58.600 --> 08:59.400]  Uh, there's Tiptoe or Tim.
[08:59.540 --> 09:00.920]  Are they all wearing the same uniform?
[09:01.440 --> 09:02.600]  Yeah, they're all on the same team.
[09:02.680 --> 09:03.620]  Rat face Robert.
[09:03.900 --> 09:04.600]  You like rats.
[09:04.820 --> 09:05.780]  I'm about rat face.
[09:05.800 --> 09:06.520]  Is that the Padres colors?
[09:06.680 --> 09:06.940]  That's...
[09:06.940 --> 09:08.360]  No, that's the Oakland A's.
[09:08.800 --> 09:09.520]  That's the same thing, right?
[09:09.720 --> 09:11.000]  No, that's not the same thing.
[09:11.100 --> 09:11.620]  Oh, my God.
[09:11.640 --> 09:12.440]  This is the app...
[09:12.440 --> 09:13.040]  This is the app.
[09:13.160 --> 09:14.240]  This is the opposite of Gavin.
[09:14.420 --> 09:15.160]  It's Billy the brain.
[09:16.660 --> 09:17.200]  All right.
[09:17.240 --> 09:18.220]  So those are...
[09:18.220 --> 09:19.620]  So far we have Moose...
[09:19.620 --> 09:20.440]  Loosehead Melvin.
[09:20.460 --> 09:23.860]  I think that these are on the same level as rad dudes personally.
[09:24.060 --> 09:24.560]  Uh, yes.
[09:24.800 --> 09:25.740]  They're on the rad dude scale.
[09:25.740 --> 09:28.460]  I think they're better than rad dudes.
[09:28.520 --> 09:29.040]  I guess I agree.
[09:29.040 --> 09:29.660]  I think better than rad dudes.
[09:29.960 --> 09:31.140]  Rad dudes are pretty fucking...
[09:31.140 --> 09:32.560]  Don't make me open up some rad dudes.
[09:32.560 --> 09:32.840]  Don't.
[09:32.880 --> 09:33.200]  Please don't.
[09:33.360 --> 09:34.900]  We've seen all the rad dudes.
[09:35.180 --> 09:35.640]  They can change...
[09:35.640 --> 09:36.520]  There's only six cards.
[09:36.720 --> 09:38.260]  They can change all the names all they want.
[09:38.380 --> 09:39.340]  We've seen all the rad dudes.
[09:39.800 --> 09:41.360]  Uh, let's get into some sports.
[09:41.500 --> 09:41.640]  Okay.
[09:41.640 --> 09:45.160]  Here is a pack of Tops Chrome 2021 that I apparently paid $8 for.
[09:45.340 --> 09:45.680]  Wow.
[09:46.000 --> 09:47.900]  What do you think the chances are we'll get my money back?
[09:48.120 --> 09:48.520]  Zero.
[09:48.660 --> 09:49.760]  I think they're probably zero too.
[09:49.900 --> 09:49.980]  Let's see.
[09:49.980 --> 09:51.460]  What would be the worst card to get?
[09:52.560 --> 09:53.700]  Uh, let's find out.
[09:53.700 --> 09:56.680]  Uh, Carlos Correa.
[09:56.980 --> 09:59.840]  I mean, probably like Trevor Bauer.
[10:00.580 --> 10:02.560]  Um, yeah.
[10:02.760 --> 10:03.680]  That would be a bad pick.
[10:03.680 --> 10:03.920]  Ozuna.
[10:05.480 --> 10:09.420]  Like, you know, guys that are in jail or going to jail.
[10:09.720 --> 10:10.180]  Here we go.
[10:10.320 --> 10:10.500]  Acuna.
[10:12.480 --> 10:13.300]  Acuna was...
[10:13.300 --> 10:15.300]  Hey, Acuna was supposed to have a good year.
[10:15.360 --> 10:16.220]  Broke his whole leg.
[10:16.440 --> 10:16.660]  Yeah.
[10:16.880 --> 10:18.060]  If you can do it, do it right.
[10:18.320 --> 10:18.440]  Yeah.
[10:18.660 --> 10:20.400]  Or, uh, Xander Bogarts.
[10:20.580 --> 10:20.740]  Yeah.
[10:21.360 --> 10:22.880]  Xander Bogarts is a good baseball.
[10:22.880 --> 10:24.040]  That was not $8 worth of cards.
[10:24.100 --> 10:24.280]  No.
[10:24.340 --> 10:24.860]  As usual.
[10:25.100 --> 10:26.500]  It was only like four cards also.
[10:26.760 --> 10:27.300]  That sucks.
[10:28.020 --> 10:29.160]  I'm gonna throw this to you, Eric.
[10:29.220 --> 10:29.620]  Yeah, what's up?
[10:29.860 --> 10:30.560]  I got this.
[10:30.640 --> 10:31.960]  I bought this pack for $5.
[10:32.460 --> 10:33.020]  Oh, that's fun.
[10:34.400 --> 10:36.580]  Heritage 2021 WW something wrestling.
[10:36.940 --> 10:37.300]  Heritage?
[10:37.780 --> 10:39.300]  Like, they're supposed to look like old cards?
[10:39.500 --> 10:39.720]  Yeah.
[10:40.060 --> 10:40.500]  But I don't know...
[10:40.500 --> 10:41.320]  Who's that dude on the front?
[10:41.400 --> 10:42.160]  AJ Styles.
[10:42.560 --> 10:43.200]  Phenomenal one.
[10:43.600 --> 10:46.280]  He's from, uh, he's from Georgia.
[10:47.200 --> 10:50.360]  He is a wrestler that I've seen for years and years and years and years and years.
[10:50.580 --> 10:51.400]  Do you know him personally?
[10:51.720 --> 10:51.980]  No.
[10:51.980 --> 10:54.060]  I talked to him, but I don't know him.
[10:54.220 --> 10:54.340]  Yeah.
[10:54.940 --> 11:00.040]  Do wrestlers now do like a full backstory like they used to where it was like the, you
[11:00.040 --> 11:00.240]  know?
[11:00.320 --> 11:00.580]  Yeah.
[11:00.800 --> 11:02.040]  You see, there's some of it.
[11:02.120 --> 11:04.140]  There's not as much in WWE right now.
[11:04.280 --> 11:06.120]  AEW has more character characters.
[11:06.520 --> 11:06.840]  Yeah.
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.300]  There's like a cowboy and, you know, there's like stuff like that.
[11:10.520 --> 11:11.240]  There's like a cult.
[11:11.360 --> 11:12.600]  There's like a whole cult of people.
[11:12.840 --> 11:13.540]  It's a lot of fun.
[11:13.640 --> 11:14.940]  This was $5 worth of cards.
[11:15.060 --> 11:15.360]  Oh, yeah?
[11:15.540 --> 11:15.900]  Okay.
[11:16.260 --> 11:16.520]  Let's see.
[11:16.800 --> 11:17.300]  I guarantee you.
[11:17.820 --> 11:19.380]  Tell me a little about Shelton Benjamin.
[11:19.440 --> 11:20.020]  Shelton Benjamin.
[11:20.020 --> 11:22.940]  Former NCAA collegiate athlete.
[11:23.240 --> 11:24.760]  Former WWE Tag Team Champion.
[11:24.980 --> 11:26.260]  Former member of the Hurt Business.
[11:26.620 --> 11:27.880]  World's greatest tag team.
[11:28.280 --> 11:31.300]  Part of Team Angle in the mid-2000s.
[11:31.460 --> 11:32.000]  Him and Kurt Angle?
[11:32.100 --> 11:34.680]  Him, Kurt Angle, and Charlie Haas.
[11:35.940 --> 11:42.640]  Shelton Benjamin also a former WWF Intercontinental Champion when he was the gold standard.
[11:42.800 --> 11:43.160]  Amazing.
[11:43.440 --> 11:43.860]  I love it.
[11:43.900 --> 11:44.380]  It's amazing.
[11:44.420 --> 11:45.200]  It's a fountain of knowledge.
[11:45.220 --> 11:45.980]  I love it.
[11:46.000 --> 11:46.260]  It's amazing.
[11:46.260 --> 11:50.080]  Speaking of Shelton Benjamin, his tag team partner in the Hurt Business, now defunct.
[11:50.400 --> 11:50.900]  The next card.
[11:51.420 --> 11:52.280]  Cedric Alexander.
[11:53.620 --> 11:54.060]  Boom.
[11:54.260 --> 11:58.620]  Cedric Alexander uses a finishing move called the Lumbar Check, which you should check out.
[11:58.740 --> 11:59.480]  Very cool move.
[11:59.520 --> 12:00.120]  He's got a good smile.
[12:00.300 --> 12:00.740]  He's great.
[12:02.200 --> 12:03.460]  Great professional wrestler.
[12:04.620 --> 12:05.060]  Cool dude.
[12:05.260 --> 12:07.560]  So it's these dudes and Kurt Angle were the team?
[12:07.820 --> 12:09.440]  No, not Cedric Alexander.
[12:09.760 --> 12:11.220]  He's a team with Shelton Benjamin now.
[12:11.640 --> 12:14.120]  So the Lumbar Check, does that have anything to do with your lower back?
[12:14.120 --> 12:14.420]  Yes.
[12:14.620 --> 12:21.420]  He lifts them up like a backdrop and then he goes on his back and puts his legs up and drops you on your back on his knees.
[12:21.780 --> 12:23.040]  And you spring.
[12:23.200 --> 12:23.840]  It's very fucking...
[12:23.840 --> 12:24.580]  He was a chiropractor.
[12:25.520 --> 12:26.260]  An investment.
[12:26.520 --> 12:27.820]  Yeah, they were in the Hurt Business.
[12:28.000 --> 12:28.720]  Tell me about this one.
[12:28.920 --> 12:30.280]  This is Angelo Dawkins.
[12:30.300 --> 12:31.240]  This is Angelo Dawkins.
[12:31.440 --> 12:34.100]  He's one half of the tag team Street Profits.
[12:35.060 --> 12:37.300]  Former WWE Raw Tag Team Champions.
[12:37.620 --> 12:39.160]  Former NXT Tag Team Champions as well.
[12:39.360 --> 12:40.940]  He looks like he's about to invade that guy's mouth.
[12:40.940 --> 12:44.500]  He wears headbands that make me laugh every time because they'll be like...
[12:44.500 --> 12:46.860]  He wears two headbands and one says the Curse of Greatness.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.460]  And I'm like, let's not get too far.
[12:49.700 --> 12:50.820]  Curse of Greatness.
[12:51.180 --> 12:53.340]  Do you know who's being slammed in that card?
[12:53.520 --> 12:54.380]  Can you tell?
[12:55.120 --> 12:57.240]  It looks like Machine Gun Carl Anderson.
[12:57.720 --> 12:59.400]  One half of the Good Brothers.
[12:59.800 --> 13:01.420]  Former WWE Tag Team Champion.
[13:01.540 --> 13:04.440]  Former IWGP Tag Team Champion.
[13:04.600 --> 13:06.760]  Former finalist G1 2012.
[13:07.380 --> 13:10.300]  Lost to Hiroshi Tanahashi in New Japan Pro Wrestling.
[13:10.300 --> 13:12.520]  I don't know what any of that means.
[13:13.100 --> 13:14.420]  Check out Talk & Shop, great podcast.
[13:14.580 --> 13:16.180]  They all trademark their names.
[13:16.920 --> 13:18.080]  Yeah, by and large, yeah.
[13:18.800 --> 13:21.200]  What can you tell us about Bianca Belair?
[13:21.560 --> 13:25.720]  Bianca Belair won the Women's Championship at WrestleMania last year.
[13:25.940 --> 13:28.240]  Her hair is that long and she uses like a whip sometimes.
[13:29.020 --> 13:30.700]  She is the EST of WWE.
[13:30.700 --> 13:31.860]  Like a Soul Calibur character.
[13:31.940 --> 13:32.680]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[13:32.780 --> 13:33.260]  She's the EST.
[13:33.360 --> 13:34.040]  She's the strongest.
[13:34.260 --> 13:34.980]  She's the roughest.
[13:35.100 --> 13:35.880]  She's the baddest.
[13:35.960 --> 13:36.620]  She's the fastest.
[13:36.780 --> 13:37.420]  She's the strongest.
[13:37.640 --> 13:38.320]  She's the EST.
[13:38.320 --> 13:39.520]  Oh, that's right.
[13:39.520 --> 13:40.400]  So it wasn't like established.
[13:40.940 --> 13:41.260]  She's awesome.
[13:41.400 --> 13:42.020]  She's very good.
[13:42.100 --> 13:42.600]  Very young.
[13:43.520 --> 13:44.900]  She makes her own gear.
[13:45.060 --> 13:45.400]  She's great.
[13:46.260 --> 13:47.380]  I'm a Bianca Belair fan.
[13:47.380 --> 13:48.600]  Do you want this card for later?
[13:48.940 --> 13:49.540]  I think she's great.
[13:49.620 --> 13:51.200]  I like that she uses her hair as a whip.
[13:51.280 --> 13:51.780]  I like her too.
[13:51.840 --> 13:52.440]  I'm going to put it over here.
[13:52.440 --> 13:53.100]  It's loud.
[13:53.460 --> 13:54.120]  And that she knows that she's the EST.
[13:54.160 --> 13:55.100]  Yeah, yeah, she is.
[13:55.160 --> 13:55.920]  She is the EST.
[13:56.080 --> 13:56.780]  She cracks that ponytail.
[13:57.500 --> 13:58.320]  Here's one that...
[14:00.260 --> 14:02.180]  Macho Man, maybe Savage.
[14:03.840 --> 14:07.140]  I feel like he's come up a lot lately.
[14:07.340 --> 14:07.700]  He has?
[14:07.700 --> 14:08.220]  Macho Man?
[14:08.440 --> 14:12.480]  It's because somebody listened to his rap album recently and decided to talk to us about it.
[14:12.480 --> 14:13.260]  Oh, right, right.
[14:13.280 --> 14:14.620]  Andrew, thoughts on Macho Man?
[14:15.340 --> 14:17.640]  I mean, a great wrestler, amazing promos.
[14:17.700 --> 14:19.980]  I appreciate his work on Baywatch, especially.
[14:20.140 --> 14:21.620]  It's a great episode with him and Hulk.
[14:21.720 --> 14:21.840]  Yeah.
[14:22.080 --> 14:24.380]  His rap album, surprisingly good.
[14:24.520 --> 14:27.740]  Not good, but for what it should be, surprisingly good.
[14:27.920 --> 14:28.020]  Right.
[14:28.700 --> 14:29.500]  Is it better than the Donkey Kong rap?
[14:29.500 --> 14:30.060]  It's an important clarification.
[14:30.780 --> 14:31.100]  Oh, yeah.
[14:31.700 --> 14:32.760]  Which rap is better?
[14:32.860 --> 14:34.860]  Donkey Kong rap or Macho Man rap?
[14:35.340 --> 14:35.780]  Ooh.
[14:36.200 --> 14:37.360]  I mean, Macho Man rap.
[14:37.360 --> 14:39.760]  I think every Macho Man song is better than Donkey Kong rap.
[14:39.760 --> 14:40.480]  You think Be a Man?
[14:40.640 --> 14:42.640]  Is that the song, Be a Man, is better than Donkey Kong rap?
[14:42.880 --> 14:43.640]  I think so.
[14:43.680 --> 14:43.920]  Wow.
[14:43.940 --> 14:46.200]  It's a tragedy that we've lost the music video for that.
[14:46.320 --> 14:46.520]  True.
[14:47.760 --> 14:53.660]  The Tribal Chief, Roman Reigns, current SmackDown World Heavyweight Champion.
[14:53.840 --> 14:58.380]  We're facing Brock Lesnar, likely, in a title versus title match at WrestleMania.
[14:59.060 --> 15:03.200]  Roman Reigns is managed by Paul Heyman, former member of The Shield.
[15:04.340 --> 15:05.760]  What else can you say about Roman Reigns?
[15:05.760 --> 15:06.720]  Oh, fucking Michael Chiklis.
[15:06.720 --> 15:06.980]  Yeah.
[15:10.440 --> 15:11.760]  He's the Rock's cousin.
[15:12.740 --> 15:13.940]  Is he legitimately the Rock's cousin?
[15:14.080 --> 15:14.580]  He looks like it.
[15:15.240 --> 15:17.600]  His nipple gets totally lost in that tattoo, doesn't it?
[15:17.640 --> 15:19.080]  I was about to say he looks kind of rockish.
[15:19.700 --> 15:21.200]  He's like the guy.
[15:21.360 --> 15:24.000]  This is what WWE's built around right now, is this guy.
[15:24.200 --> 15:26.360]  And then here is why I said this pack is worth it.
[15:26.380 --> 15:26.580]  Oh, I'm excited.
[15:27.020 --> 15:27.720]  This is very exciting.
[15:27.780 --> 15:27.860]  Okay.
[15:28.920 --> 15:29.280]  Boom.
[15:29.600 --> 15:30.800]  Oh, Rhea Ripley.
[15:30.800 --> 15:35.060]  Rhea Ripley, auto-numbered 114 of 199.
[15:35.060 --> 15:37.660]  You know who likes Rhea Ripley was Michael.
[15:38.020 --> 15:43.300]  I did a watch-along of Royal Rumble with Michael, and he was all about Rhea Ripley.
[15:43.720 --> 15:43.960]  Really?
[15:44.320 --> 15:44.720]  Rhea Ripley was cool.
[15:44.820 --> 15:45.800]  Rhea Ripley is awesome.
[15:45.960 --> 15:46.720]  She's from Australia.
[15:47.040 --> 15:48.460]  Is she better than Bianca?
[15:48.600 --> 15:49.980]  No, they, like, they'll feud sometimes.
[15:50.120 --> 15:50.700]  They have good matches.
[15:51.020 --> 15:51.120]  Okay.
[15:51.680 --> 15:55.160]  Yeah, she's like fucking, like, jacked to the gills.
[15:55.460 --> 15:56.080]  That's fucking cool.
[15:56.080 --> 15:56.660]  She's a gill jacker.
[15:56.680 --> 15:57.100]  Yeah, bro.
[15:57.580 --> 15:58.080]  It's sick.
[15:58.280 --> 16:00.080]  We'll go ahead and sleeve this.
[16:00.080 --> 16:00.680]  Hang on to that one.
[16:00.960 --> 16:01.520]  This is a good save.
[16:01.640 --> 16:03.680]  This is our legit hit.
[16:04.020 --> 16:04.540]  I like it.
[16:04.540 --> 16:05.800]  Yeah, Rhea Ripley.
[16:05.900 --> 16:06.820]  It's auto on card.
[16:06.920 --> 16:07.560]  Sell this to Michael.
[16:07.980 --> 16:08.340]  Wow.
[16:08.960 --> 16:11.240]  Yeah, it's on card autographed, by the way.
[16:11.420 --> 16:11.500]  Damn.
[16:11.700 --> 16:12.180]  Excellent point.
[16:12.500 --> 16:15.040]  That puts it clearly ahead of the competition.
[16:15.040 --> 16:15.320]  Yeah, no kidding.
[16:16.440 --> 16:18.560]  All right, let's, you know what?
[16:18.680 --> 16:19.500]  Let's open this one up.
[16:19.540 --> 16:25.220]  This came from a previously super fan, then more recently minor league fan.
[16:25.320 --> 16:26.720]  I think now we're just going to call him fan Jack.
[16:26.720 --> 16:27.600]  I think just, yeah.
[16:27.600 --> 16:29.120]  I mean, we saw him today.
[16:29.280 --> 16:29.800]  We saw him today.
[16:29.940 --> 16:30.860]  Didn't offer to stick around.
[16:30.940 --> 16:31.380]  Did not.
[16:31.700 --> 16:34.040]  I was going to say, hey, man, are you sticking around for this?
[16:34.040 --> 16:35.140]  Finally, we can use you.
[16:35.440 --> 16:39.780]  But I wanted to see if he was going to be the one to go, hey, is it cool?
[16:39.880 --> 16:40.500]  Watched us set up.
[16:40.640 --> 16:41.400]  Yeah, I watched him leave.
[16:41.900 --> 16:42.100]  Yeah.
[16:42.780 --> 16:44.600]  Once again, refusing to be a part of the content.
[16:44.880 --> 16:46.560]  Andrew, do you think it would have been better if Jack was here?
[16:47.960 --> 16:48.320]  Ugh.
[16:50.280 --> 16:50.640]  Oh.
[16:52.120 --> 16:52.360]  Yeah.
[16:53.560 --> 16:54.680]  That's a good answer.
[16:56.100 --> 16:57.320]  Emily on the new soundboard.
[16:57.360 --> 16:57.580]  Yeah.
[16:58.260 --> 17:01.700]  So Jack, fan, like, it's not just fan Jack.
[17:01.720 --> 17:03.780]  It's space fan Jack.
[17:03.780 --> 17:04.620]  Yeah, ellipses.
[17:05.040 --> 17:05.400]  Fan Jack.
[17:05.900 --> 17:09.940]  When he was running the marathon at Disney because he was getting chased by somebody, I guess.
[17:10.460 --> 17:11.180]  Angry Goofy.
[17:12.080 --> 17:15.260]  He ducked in and found these cat in the hat, the movie, trading cards.
[17:15.400 --> 17:16.280]  So he bought them for us.
[17:17.280 --> 17:18.540]  Angry Goofy chasing me.
[17:19.260 --> 17:20.300]  Why are we running?
[17:20.480 --> 17:21.380]  Eric Goofy's pissed.
[17:23.120 --> 17:24.360]  Not a morning person, that Goofy.
[17:24.520 --> 17:24.700]  Okay.
[17:25.360 --> 17:27.520]  So here we have Jim Carrey.
[17:27.740 --> 17:28.140]  There's the cat.
[17:28.140 --> 17:28.920]  Have you seen this movie?
[17:28.920 --> 17:29.540]  That's Mike Myers.
[17:30.800 --> 17:32.080]  Yeah, Geoff, have you seen this movie?
[17:32.240 --> 17:33.120]  No, no, I've never seen it.
[17:33.120 --> 17:33.860]  Andrew, have you seen this movie?
[17:34.260 --> 17:38.640]  I watched it about a year and a half ago because I remember seeing trailers for it as a kid.
[17:38.740 --> 17:40.040]  And it is a fever dream.
[17:40.180 --> 17:40.440]  Yeah.
[17:40.500 --> 17:42.020]  It is such a weird thing that it exists.
[17:42.140 --> 17:43.680]  What can you tell us about this moment?
[17:43.960 --> 17:44.240]  Oh.
[17:45.560 --> 17:48.260]  I don't think I can tell you a single thing about this movie.
[17:48.440 --> 17:49.080]  Do you know what they call this?
[17:49.080 --> 17:49.700]  I can kind of watch it and forget.
[17:49.960 --> 17:50.500]  What are they called?
[17:50.600 --> 17:51.040]  Kid napping.
[17:51.900 --> 17:52.260]  Ooh.
[17:52.460 --> 17:54.280]  He was in the kid, that kid.
[17:54.960 --> 17:55.620]  He was inside?
[17:56.540 --> 17:59.840]  No, no, he's the kid in the Bruce Willis movie, The Kid.
[17:59.840 --> 18:00.220]  Oh!
[18:00.700 --> 18:02.740]  He's the kid in the movie, The Kid.
[18:02.800 --> 18:04.960]  But Mike Myers wasn't in this child.
[18:05.020 --> 18:07.820]  No, well, now I'm aware of when you said that.
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.320]  Is he dressed like the Lorax? Is that another...
[18:10.320 --> 18:11.240]  It looks like a Lorax.
[18:11.500 --> 18:11.900]  Yeah, it does kind of.
[18:12.400 --> 18:17.820]  He's also, fun fact about him, Spencer Breslin, that's the brother of Abigail Breslin from Little Miss Sunshine.
[18:17.920 --> 18:19.360]  That's Abigail Breslin's brother?
[18:19.740 --> 18:21.660]  Who directed Cat in the Hat?
[18:22.740 --> 18:25.900]  Uh, there's a tennis... that's Emily and I playing tennis.
[18:26.000 --> 18:26.600]  Oh, wow.
[18:26.840 --> 18:27.720]  Getting back to this.
[18:27.900 --> 18:28.140]  Yeah.
[18:28.140 --> 18:30.100]  Here's Dr. Cat, it looks like.
[18:30.260 --> 18:32.800]  Wow, Dr. Cat, like Dr. Dog, but Cat.
[18:33.200 --> 18:36.120]  It's, uh, I don't know what the fuck that was going on there.
[18:36.540 --> 18:37.400]  Thing 1 and Thing 2?
[18:37.900 --> 18:38.460]  That's fucking...
[18:38.460 --> 18:40.600]  It looks like Thing is puppeteering Medea.
[18:40.680 --> 18:41.280]  It's terrifying.
[18:41.360 --> 18:42.300]  That looks like Wicked.
[18:42.540 --> 18:42.680]  Yeah.
[18:42.680 --> 18:44.500]  That's, like, I don't like that.
[18:44.940 --> 18:45.520]  Is this...
[18:45.520 --> 18:46.340]  These cards suck.
[18:46.460 --> 18:47.120]  It's not good.
[18:47.360 --> 18:48.380]  Is this, who is this?
[18:48.380 --> 18:48.560]  The movie sucks.
[18:48.760 --> 18:49.360]  Who's this lady?
[18:51.500 --> 18:51.800]  I...
[18:51.800 --> 18:52.960]  Uh, I don't know.
[18:53.060 --> 18:53.820]  Oh, what is...
[18:53.820 --> 18:54.580]  Debbie Mazar.
[18:55.000 --> 18:55.260]  No.
[18:55.960 --> 18:56.240]  No.
[18:56.240 --> 18:57.520]  Kelly Preston?
[18:57.620 --> 18:58.460]  It's Kristen Chenoweth.
[18:58.680 --> 18:58.900]  No.
[18:59.340 --> 19:00.800]  Oh, here's Kid Likes Cookies.
[19:00.960 --> 19:01.680]  Kids love cookies.
[19:01.940 --> 19:02.760]  Save that, too.
[19:02.880 --> 19:03.300]  I like that.
[19:04.080 --> 19:04.500]  All right.
[19:04.560 --> 19:05.100]  Well, there's the...
[19:05.100 --> 19:05.740]  Thanks, Super...
[19:05.740 --> 19:09.200]  I think, like, put into context how bad those cards are.
[19:09.260 --> 19:09.360]  Yeah.
[19:09.420 --> 19:12.140]  That is not the thing that killed Michael Myers' film career.
[19:12.660 --> 19:15.560]  That's, like, as a bar for how bad the love guru is.
[19:15.620 --> 19:16.580]  The cat in the hat was something.
[19:16.660 --> 19:17.780]  He's like, I can bounce back from this.
[19:18.260 --> 19:19.000]  Here we go.
[19:19.940 --> 19:22.260]  Topps 2021 update series.
[19:22.340 --> 19:22.560]  Oh.
[19:23.020 --> 19:24.380]  Acuna Jr. on the cover.
[19:24.380 --> 19:26.140]  I bought these from Target.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.280]  Think we'll have baseball this year?
[19:28.920 --> 19:29.140]  Yeah.
[19:29.240 --> 19:30.140]  They said it's going to start on time.
[19:30.900 --> 19:31.760]  I saw that this week.
[19:32.740 --> 19:33.680]  Who said that?
[19:33.700 --> 19:36.840]  Like, the MLB Owners Association or something said baseball's going to start on time.
[19:37.160 --> 19:37.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:37.420 --> 19:37.680]  Uh-huh.
[19:38.080 --> 19:39.160]  That's what the owners said, huh?
[19:39.560 --> 19:40.600]  Colton Wong.
[19:41.340 --> 19:42.500]  He's got some pretty flowers.
[19:42.780 --> 19:42.940]  Yep.
[19:43.520 --> 19:44.740]  Oh, Andrew Vaughn, rookie.
[19:44.880 --> 19:45.320]  I'll take that.
[19:45.360 --> 19:46.000]  White Sox.
[19:47.940 --> 19:49.520]  Oh, here's that guy.
[19:50.400 --> 19:51.200]  Kai Tom.
[19:51.420 --> 19:52.040]  I'm not familiar with him.
[19:52.120 --> 19:53.000]  He's a Pittsburgh Pirate.
[19:53.340 --> 19:53.640]  Yar.
[19:54.580 --> 19:59.320]  What I think is so great about baseball is, like, when you look at cards for other athletes,
[19:59.400 --> 20:02.160]  you can tell that, like, that's from the 50s or 60s.
[20:02.300 --> 20:04.660]  So many of these cards, I couldn't tell you what era they were in.
[20:05.000 --> 20:08.240]  Like, if the picture quality was less, like, if you were to blur every photo, this could
[20:08.240 --> 20:08.880]  be the 40s.
[20:09.080 --> 20:09.240]  Sure.
[20:10.120 --> 20:11.800]  Well, the sport hasn't changed much since the 40s.
[20:11.840 --> 20:16.100]  There's Alex Reyes doing it for the big man upstairs, number one.
[20:17.040 --> 20:18.080]  Oh, Bryce Wilson.
[20:18.520 --> 20:20.000]  Keep our eyes open for leg kicks, right?
[20:20.060 --> 20:20.480]  High legs.
[20:20.640 --> 20:21.080]  Yep, yep, yep.
[20:21.980 --> 20:23.540]  Here's Adam Frazier.
[20:23.840 --> 20:24.080]  Okay.
[20:24.640 --> 20:25.680]  He's a padre now.
[20:25.980 --> 20:26.980]  Wade Davis.
[20:27.500 --> 20:28.280]  I like the...
[20:28.640 --> 20:29.960]  I don't like the Royals, but I like the blue.
[20:30.220 --> 20:33.720]  Wait, Wade Davis... isn't that, like...
[20:33.720 --> 20:35.160]  Ozzie Davis' cousin?
[20:35.340 --> 20:35.660]  No.
[20:36.020 --> 20:36.200]  No.
[20:37.100 --> 20:37.540]  Isn't...
[20:37.540 --> 20:38.320]  I feel like...
[20:38.320 --> 20:39.480]  I feel like...
[20:39.480 --> 20:42.620]  I feel like Wade Davis was in baseball for, like, a really long time.
[20:42.660 --> 20:43.660]  Maybe I'm thinking of a different guy.
[20:43.940 --> 20:45.620]  Well, he's been playing since 09.
[20:46.040 --> 20:48.120]  He was with the Devil Rays till 12.
[20:48.440 --> 20:49.920]  13, he moved to the Royals.
[20:49.920 --> 20:52.940]  Went to the Cubs in 17, and then to the Rockies in 20.
[20:53.120 --> 20:53.400]  Huh.
[20:53.520 --> 20:54.600]  Back to the Royals, I guess.
[20:54.700 --> 20:55.180]  I didn't mean to do that.
[20:55.320 --> 20:55.460]  What?
[20:58.560 --> 20:59.280]  Garrett Stubbs.
[20:59.380 --> 20:59.520]  Okay.
[21:00.080 --> 21:00.920]  Oh, Walker Bueller.
[21:01.280 --> 21:02.020]  There you go, Dodgers.
[21:02.200 --> 21:02.740]  That's a leg kick.
[21:02.780 --> 21:03.520]  That's a leg kick.
[21:03.520 --> 21:04.600]  That's a high leg right there.
[21:04.640 --> 21:05.220]  We'll put that over there.
[21:05.240 --> 21:05.460]  Look at that leg kick.
[21:06.140 --> 21:06.860]  Oh, boy.
[21:07.360 --> 21:07.460]  Okay.
[21:08.240 --> 21:10.500]  Francisco Lindor on the retro card.
[21:11.440 --> 21:11.760]  Not numbered.
[21:13.320 --> 21:15.900]  Then we have Chase Anderson.
[21:18.260 --> 21:19.060]  Angel Rondon.
[21:20.340 --> 21:22.020]  Didn't even give us a chance to look at it.
[21:22.060 --> 21:23.220]  You just said, I'm taking it.
[21:23.360 --> 21:23.760]  There you go.
[21:25.160 --> 21:27.180]  I was about to say, that's a wide stance.
[21:27.200 --> 21:27.920]  It is, incredibly.
[21:27.940 --> 21:28.880]  The next card, equally wide.
[21:29.060 --> 21:30.420]  He's full of stride, you know.
[21:31.180 --> 21:31.980]  Will Harris.
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.480]  That's a stank face right there.
[21:35.780 --> 21:36.820]  He's got an ugly mug on that guy.
[21:36.840 --> 21:37.340]  We're going to save that.
[21:37.500 --> 21:38.420]  That's a stinky face.
[21:38.680 --> 21:40.720]  And then Nate Lowe.
[21:40.720 --> 21:41.080]  Okay.
[21:42.860 --> 21:43.960]  Okay, there we go.
[21:45.140 --> 21:45.940]  Moving along.
[21:46.060 --> 21:46.200]  Yep.
[21:46.580 --> 21:47.900]  I'm excited about this one.
[21:48.320 --> 21:48.660]  Oh, yeah?
[21:48.940 --> 21:49.840]  How much did you pay for these?
[21:50.040 --> 21:50.520]  I'm going to be excited about this one.
[21:50.660 --> 21:51.420]  Oh, okay.
[21:51.620 --> 21:52.000]  I'm going to be excited about this one.
[21:52.240 --> 21:52.880]  We're going to open up.
[21:53.100 --> 21:54.140]  Guess where I bought these at.
[21:54.700 --> 21:56.320]  Uh, hang on.
[21:57.520 --> 21:58.520]  The card store.
[21:58.880 --> 21:59.260]  I wish.
[21:59.440 --> 22:00.300]  No, even better.
[22:00.500 --> 22:01.360]  I didn't have to buy it at the card store.
[22:01.720 --> 22:03.680]  They sold these at the grocery store.
[22:04.280 --> 22:04.680]  What?
[22:04.780 --> 22:05.120]  ATV?
[22:05.240 --> 22:06.640]  Yeah, these are great fucking cards.
[22:06.820 --> 22:07.640]  Hard to find.
[22:07.740 --> 22:08.740]  ATV had an optic.
[22:09.700 --> 22:10.100]  Basketball.
[22:10.840 --> 22:12.380]  And they wouldn't sell me more than five.
[22:12.540 --> 22:13.620]  I had to get a whole thing of them.
[22:13.640 --> 22:15.040]  At the grocery store?
[22:15.460 --> 22:15.740]  Yeah.
[22:16.500 --> 22:18.680]  The grocery store said you can't buy these cards?
[22:18.800 --> 22:20.920]  Yeah, and then the teller was like, people are getting shot for these.
[22:20.940 --> 22:21.900]  And I was like, I'm aware of that.
[22:21.960 --> 22:22.540]  Can I buy them?
[22:22.820 --> 22:23.400]  It was a whole thing.
[22:23.500 --> 22:23.840]  You were there.
[22:23.960 --> 22:29.120]  Yeah, it was like the lady, it popped up something where she was like, I can't scan anymore.
[22:29.300 --> 22:32.220]  And then the lady that was helping us bag, she was like, I think she used to work at Target.
[22:32.380 --> 22:35.120]  And that's where she was like, yeah, you can only buy five at a time.
[22:35.160 --> 22:35.680]  It's a whole thing.
[22:35.680 --> 22:36.720]  And we were like, we have no idea.
[22:38.860 --> 22:39.420]  Alex Caruso.
[22:39.420 --> 22:43.840]  Oh, AC Fresh, my favorite Chicago Bull now injured.
[22:44.640 --> 22:51.680]  Unfortunate that AC Fresh got his wrist snapped by, what's his name?
[22:52.600 --> 22:53.860]  Oh, I don't remember.
[22:53.980 --> 22:54.980]  But everyone was real pissed.
[22:55.240 --> 22:55.820]  It was pretty cool.
[22:55.940 --> 22:56.140]  What is his name?
[22:56.460 --> 22:57.140]  I'll run into him.
[22:57.220 --> 22:57.580]  He plays for the Bucks.
[22:57.640 --> 23:01.800]  I just think he's a cool basketball player to still get arrested for weed in 2021.
[23:01.940 --> 23:02.740]  He's in Texas, by the way.
[23:02.740 --> 23:03.380]  Yeah, isn't that great?
[23:03.480 --> 23:04.240]  College Station.
[23:04.300 --> 23:04.920]  Fucking awesome.
[23:05.160 --> 23:06.780]  Montrez Harold, also not a Laker.
[23:06.880 --> 23:08.860]  He plays for the Wizards, I believe, right now.
[23:09.740 --> 23:12.580]  Sweet Lou Williams, not a Clipper, playing for the Hawks.
[23:13.100 --> 23:15.820]  Lamarcus Aldridge, not a Spur, plays for the Nets.
[23:17.180 --> 23:20.260]  Draymond Green, definitely still a Golden State Warrior.
[23:20.300 --> 23:20.860]  Not going anywhere.
[23:21.620 --> 23:23.900]  I have no idea if Zach Collins is still with Portland or not.
[23:24.660 --> 23:27.640]  Oh, Mitchell Robinson, purple parallel.
[23:28.040 --> 23:29.460]  That's nice, except it's Mitchell Robinson.
[23:29.900 --> 23:30.520]  That's okay, though.
[23:31.200 --> 23:32.960]  Oh, James Harden, my house.
[23:33.200 --> 23:34.780]  Not going to be a Net for much longer.
[23:34.780 --> 23:37.760]  I was going to say, not really for now.
[23:37.760 --> 23:39.380]  Oh, here we go. Air defense.
[23:40.040 --> 23:41.480]  Ron James, that's a cool card.
[23:42.480 --> 23:43.540]  Who's he going up and over?
[23:43.980 --> 23:45.760]  He's going up and over...
[23:48.140 --> 23:50.080]  Oh, he's dunking on Black Lives Matter.
[23:50.520 --> 23:51.600]  Oh, is that what it says?
[23:51.720 --> 23:53.400]  I think that might be...
[23:53.400 --> 23:55.580]  I thought it was somebody with a really long Spanish name.
[23:56.820 --> 23:59.600]  I mean, it looks kind of like Tyler Herro,
[24:00.260 --> 24:02.540]  but it looks like maybe the last name says Kennard,
[24:02.640 --> 24:05.120]  so maybe it's Luke Kennard, although the jersey doesn't match that.
[24:05.140 --> 24:06.540]  But at the top it says Black Lives Matter.
[24:06.540 --> 24:08.580]  On the jersey it says Black Lives Matter.
[24:08.940 --> 24:10.040]  I'm just reading what it says.
[24:10.920 --> 24:14.100]  Denny Avija, a decent rookie.
[24:15.200 --> 24:17.460]  Jameis Ramsey. I don't know if it's Jameis or Jamias.
[24:17.500 --> 24:19.720]  I've heard it pronounced both ways. I apologize if I said it wrong.
[24:19.720 --> 24:21.180]  Like a Marriott-Marriott situation.
[24:21.200 --> 24:24.980]  Yeah, Marriott-Marriott. And then Sadiq Bae, great, great young basketball player.
[24:25.500 --> 24:26.160]  That's a nice little card.
[24:26.340 --> 24:29.020]  Okay, that was not worth... well, that was grocery store money.
[24:29.080 --> 24:29.720]  That was probably worth it.
[24:29.780 --> 24:31.720]  That was, guys, that was grocery store money.
[24:31.720 --> 24:33.780]  This will be not worth it.
[24:33.800 --> 24:35.520]  Check out that price at the very top.
[24:35.520 --> 24:36.800]  $59.99.
[24:36.800 --> 24:39.320]  Apparently I paid $60 for these cards.
[24:39.320 --> 24:41.100]  Andrew, what's $60 Canadian?
[24:41.500 --> 24:43.520]  Like, $60 US is what Canadian?
[24:43.520 --> 24:44.520]  How many loonies is that?
[24:44.600 --> 24:44.920]  Like $80?
[24:46.080 --> 24:49.620]  Yeah, it'd be like $90 Canadian.
[24:49.960 --> 24:50.400]  Wow.
[24:51.040 --> 24:53.600]  So the chances of us getting $60 out of this, not great.
[24:53.940 --> 24:55.560]  But maybe $90 Canadian.
[24:55.940 --> 24:58.480]  Jaron Jackson Jr., great young basketball player.
[24:58.680 --> 25:02.560]  Memphis Grizzlies, if you are not a fan of the Memphis Grizzlies this year, you need to be.
[25:02.640 --> 25:04.700]  Because they are fucking fun.
[25:04.700 --> 25:05.980]  And they are good.
[25:06.340 --> 25:08.260]  John Morant is the real deal.
[25:08.660 --> 25:12.000]  Jamal Murray, hurt, phenomenal basketball player.
[25:14.540 --> 25:16.000]  Great new New Balance commercial.
[25:16.460 --> 25:17.900]  Have you seen the New Balance commercial that he does?
[25:17.980 --> 25:20.120]  Where he's like, yeah, we don't have the shoes, but they're fresh.
[25:20.720 --> 25:22.400]  Yeah, he's very funny in it.
[25:23.120 --> 25:23.660]  Uh, Kent Bazemore.
[25:24.660 --> 25:26.060]  Uh, he's probably terrified that he's not going to be able to play.
[25:26.180 --> 25:26.820]  He's fucking hurt.
[25:27.720 --> 25:29.780]  Dude, that's a good shot.
[25:30.760 --> 25:32.760]  His legs are all the way up there.
[25:32.760 --> 25:34.760]  Jordan Clarkson got fucking...
[25:35.300 --> 25:36.780]  What are these cards?
[25:37.080 --> 25:37.800]  These are most...
[25:37.800 --> 25:41.840]  What are these wacky legs going on in all these cards, dude?
[25:41.940 --> 25:43.340]  This is a lot of... they got crazy legs.
[25:43.840 --> 25:44.820]  There's Jordan Clarkson.
[25:45.140 --> 25:46.300]  He got embarrassed.
[25:46.460 --> 25:48.600]  He fell down. He got his ankles broke the other day.
[25:48.720 --> 25:48.860]  Ouch.
[25:50.280 --> 25:51.500]  Uh, let's see, Jarrett Culver.
[25:51.500 --> 25:53.920]  I mean, he looks like he's never seen a basketball before.
[25:54.160 --> 25:55.720]  So that is not shocking.
[25:56.160 --> 25:58.280]  DeMar DeRozan, currently a bull.
[25:58.380 --> 25:59.580]  No longer a spur.
[26:00.440 --> 26:02.620]  OG Ananobi, I believe, is still a raptor.
[26:02.900 --> 26:03.980]  Reggie Perry, rookie.
[26:05.360 --> 26:05.960]  Oh, here we go.
[26:06.000 --> 26:06.640]  Russell Westbrook.
[26:07.880 --> 26:08.680]  Rough year.
[26:08.900 --> 26:12.400]  Also not a Washington Wizard currently, but maybe for not much longer.
[26:12.400 --> 26:14.520]  I was going to say, he's an L.A. Laker, sort of.
[26:14.580 --> 26:16.100]  They have, apparently, I was reading today,
[26:16.200 --> 26:19.120]  lost all confidence that they can win at a high level with Russell Westbrook.
[26:19.180 --> 26:23.480]  It is weird that a guy who has probably an unbeatable record.
[26:23.660 --> 26:27.180]  He has averaged three seasons in his career with a triple-double.
[26:27.640 --> 26:29.160]  Only person to ever do it
[26:29.160 --> 26:29.540]  with a triple-double.
[26:29.540 --> 26:29.560]  I mean, I don't know.
[26:30.220 --> 26:31.400]  He was Oscar Robertson.
[26:31.500 --> 26:33.780]  He did it once, one year. It was considered one of the best years
[26:33.780 --> 26:34.660]  in the history of basketball.
[26:35.560 --> 26:36.660]  Russell Westbrook's done it three times.
[26:36.820 --> 26:38.600]  Now, nobody wants him.
[26:41.160 --> 26:42.420]  Just untouchable career
[26:42.420 --> 26:43.100]  with a guy.
[26:43.220 --> 26:44.920]  Nobody, just let him go.
[26:45.680 --> 26:47.080]  What can we get for him?
[26:47.440 --> 26:49.420]  What pieces can we get for him, is how it feels.
[26:49.500 --> 26:51.620]  I heard that Houston might be interested
[26:51.620 --> 26:52.280]  in taking him back.
[26:53.920 --> 26:55.240]  Harden ran him out of town.
[26:56.280 --> 26:57.240]  So, we'll see.
[26:57.920 --> 26:59.820]  I can't figure out what he's trying to do.
[27:00.100 --> 27:00.480]  What do you mean?
[27:00.780 --> 27:02.220]  He doesn't know what he's trying to do either.
[27:02.480 --> 27:04.620]  Is he trying to shoot? Is he going into a dunk?
[27:05.780 --> 27:06.620]  I'll tell you what that is.
[27:06.660 --> 27:07.260]  That is an inbound pass.
[27:09.160 --> 27:10.540]  It seems inbounding.
[27:10.680 --> 27:13.000]  That is a weird image to put on a card.
[27:13.420 --> 27:14.820]  I'd be insulted if that was
[27:14.820 --> 27:17.260]  my greatest moment was inbounding a pass.
[27:17.360 --> 27:18.080]  Well, now this is weird.
[27:18.440 --> 27:19.760]  Last pack, we opened a Voptik.
[27:20.220 --> 27:21.980]  We got a Jameis Ramsey card, rookie.
[27:22.580 --> 27:24.960]  And, followed by a Denny and Visa card.
[27:24.960 --> 27:26.100]  There we go.
[27:26.540 --> 27:27.580]  Both of those guys.
[27:28.740 --> 27:31.380]  Eric Pascal. He is no longer
[27:31.380 --> 27:32.080]  a warrior.
[27:32.420 --> 27:34.960]  I believe he plays...
[27:35.840 --> 27:36.860]  Maybe he's still a warrior.
[27:37.120 --> 27:39.020]  I'm not sure. But that is a mosaic
[27:39.020 --> 27:39.820]  parallel.
[27:40.200 --> 27:40.840]  Nice.
[27:43.460 --> 27:44.460]  Isn't that fun to look at?
[27:45.200 --> 27:45.760]  There we go.
[27:46.400 --> 27:48.300]  Here's MPJ, Michael Porter Jr.
[27:48.700 --> 27:51.000]  He is very good
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.040]  and very hurt.
[27:52.040 --> 27:53.680]  Andrew, do you like these mosaics?
[27:54.700 --> 27:56.280]  I'm looking at the legs
[27:56.280 --> 27:57.640]  here. Are these leg sleeves?
[27:57.820 --> 27:58.500]  Are these pants?
[27:59.100 --> 28:00.540]  These are leg sleeves.
[28:02.120 --> 28:04.000]  The last guy only has one.
[28:04.220 --> 28:06.460]  What is he doing? Is it a stylistic choice?
[28:06.900 --> 28:07.780]  Probably a little bit of both.
[28:08.420 --> 28:09.640]  Here we go. Devin Booker.
[28:10.780 --> 28:11.740]  Currently dating
[28:11.740 --> 28:12.900]  Kendall Jenner.
[28:14.400 --> 28:14.880]  Andrew,
[28:15.560 --> 28:17.420]  do you consider yourself a Stairmaster?
[28:18.760 --> 28:19.720]  A Stairmaster?
[28:19.720 --> 28:20.600]  What do you mean by that?
[28:20.720 --> 28:22.440]  What do you think it means?
[28:23.100 --> 28:25.200]  It's a product that people use.
[28:25.460 --> 28:27.880]  But this is S-T-A-R-E.
[28:28.080 --> 28:29.620]  Oh, a Stairmaster.
[28:29.840 --> 28:30.520]  I see what you're saying.
[28:32.260 --> 28:33.740]  I bet if you were to look
[28:33.740 --> 28:35.600]  at my overall record in staring contests,
[28:35.660 --> 28:36.920]  I'm probably 80% a victor.
[28:37.340 --> 28:38.420]  I'd say I'm a Stairmaster.
[28:38.780 --> 28:40.240]  Do you think you can beat Devin Booker?
[28:40.500 --> 28:41.820]  Without a doubt, I can beat him.
[28:41.940 --> 28:44.660]  Devin Booker got fucked up by the Raptors mascot.
[28:44.800 --> 28:46.920]  I can take out Devin Booker any day of the week.
[28:46.920 --> 28:49.200]  Devin Booker scored 70 points on the Celtics two years ago.
[28:49.200 --> 28:51.340]  Was that him? He was the one who made the Raptors go away?
[28:51.440 --> 28:53.640]  Yeah, he's the one that made the Raptors go away.
[28:53.840 --> 28:56.220]  There's no way he can beat me in a Stairoff.
[28:56.240 --> 28:57.620]  Last card, probably not $60,
[28:58.020 --> 28:59.780]  but it is a legitimate hit.
[29:00.660 --> 29:01.460]  John Morant.
[29:01.600 --> 29:03.220]  John Morant Swagger card.
[29:03.500 --> 29:04.860]  I don't know what kind of parallel this is.
[29:04.960 --> 29:06.240]  Maybe just be a mosaic,
[29:06.780 --> 29:07.880]  base mosaic parallel.
[29:08.280 --> 29:09.920]  But that's a pretty cool card.
[29:09.920 --> 29:11.720]  If somebody yelled Swagger at you,
[29:11.800 --> 29:13.820]  I'd feel like I was being insulted.
[29:13.820 --> 29:15.860]  Are you a Swag Master, would you say?
[29:16.320 --> 29:17.940]  I'm definitely not a Swag Master.
[29:18.300 --> 29:19.820]  But it's just, I don't know, Swagger...
[29:20.560 --> 29:21.000]  I don't know.
[29:21.320 --> 29:23.100]  Alright, now we get to open up our Optic
[29:23.860 --> 29:24.940]  extra bonus pack.
[29:25.060 --> 29:27.400]  It should be three pink camo cards, I believe.
[29:27.640 --> 29:29.280]  Three pink camo cards?
[29:29.480 --> 29:31.300]  No, I'm sorry, these are blue.
[29:32.620 --> 29:33.800]  Unfortunately, these are blue.
[29:33.940 --> 29:34.680]  Dejounte Murray,
[29:35.420 --> 29:37.980]  Jordan Wara, rookie, unfortunately not worth much,
[29:38.020 --> 29:38.520]  but that's cool.
[29:39.340 --> 29:41.120]  And then Bogdan Bogdanovich.
[29:41.120 --> 29:41.960]  Oh no!
[29:44.800 --> 29:46.140]  He's currently on the trade table.
[29:46.200 --> 29:47.760]  Andrew, do you think there are any other names
[29:47.760 --> 29:50.300]  that should be in the camp of Bogdan Bogdanovich
[29:50.300 --> 29:52.820]  where it's your first name and then your first name again?
[29:54.640 --> 29:55.440]  Bogdan Bogdanovich?
[29:55.500 --> 29:55.640]  Yeah.
[29:56.800 --> 29:57.760]  What do you mean by that?
[29:57.840 --> 29:58.960]  Like, we're making up names?
[30:00.840 --> 30:02.080]  What is the camp?
[30:02.280 --> 30:04.220]  What is the Bogdan Bogdanovich camp?
[30:04.340 --> 30:07.180]  I mean, you can look at what his name is.
[30:07.820 --> 30:08.220]  Okay.
[30:08.220 --> 30:09.060]  Right.
[30:10.520 --> 30:11.960]  How it's his first name twice.
[30:12.860 --> 30:14.640]  Oh, Bogdan Bogdanovich.
[30:14.880 --> 30:15.080]  Right.
[30:15.420 --> 30:16.380]  I see what you're saying.
[30:16.720 --> 30:18.560]  Did you not before? I thought I was pretty clear.
[30:18.560 --> 30:21.400]  No, I couldn't make out.
[30:22.160 --> 30:23.760]  I'm trying to think of names.
[30:26.500 --> 30:27.380]  Michael Michelson?
[30:27.700 --> 30:28.460]  Is that a name?
[30:28.580 --> 30:29.600]  That's a good one, yeah.
[30:30.320 --> 30:31.200]  William Williamson?
[30:31.560 --> 30:33.600]  Kind of like a Nick Nichols kind of situation?
[30:33.920 --> 30:34.740]  That's a good one.
[30:36.180 --> 30:36.540]  Uh...
[30:36.540 --> 30:37.940]  Yeah, I don't think I can name any other.
[30:38.980 --> 30:39.900]  Well, thanks for trying.
[30:41.060 --> 30:42.320]  This is for you, Andrew.
[30:42.580 --> 30:44.360]  I bought a pack of MVP hockey.
[30:45.220 --> 30:46.820]  Everybody loves it when I open hockey
[30:46.820 --> 30:47.900]  and I say all the hockey names.
[30:49.220 --> 30:50.740]  This is 21-22.
[30:50.980 --> 30:51.380]  This is going to be...
[30:51.880 --> 30:53.860]  It's an unfortunate...
[30:53.860 --> 30:55.560]  Rough year for the NHL, huh, bud?
[30:56.280 --> 30:59.120]  It's a rough year to have the Blackhawk on your product.
[30:59.320 --> 30:59.640]  Got it.
[31:00.680 --> 31:01.360]  Here we go.
[31:01.360 --> 31:01.640]  Let's see.
[31:02.980 --> 31:03.620]  Torrey Krug.
[31:06.020 --> 31:07.540]  The Krugger, they call him.
[31:07.860 --> 31:08.800]  The Krugmeister.
[31:08.900 --> 31:10.120]  Hey, what's up, I'm Krug.
[31:12.160 --> 31:13.620]  You know, a lot of people know this.
[31:13.640 --> 31:15.080]  When he jacks off, he calls it Krug-tugging.
[31:15.680 --> 31:16.000]  Disgusting.
[31:18.220 --> 31:19.380]  Alex Ovechkin, heard of him.
[31:20.020 --> 31:21.060]  He plays for the Capitals. MVP.
[31:22.140 --> 31:22.820]  A lot of MVPs.
[31:22.920 --> 31:24.660]  I thought there would only be one MVP, but apparently...
[31:24.660 --> 31:25.840]  Alex Ovechkin...
[31:27.400 --> 31:29.420]  I don't know if they still do it, but there was a year
[31:29.420 --> 31:31.380]  where the last person picked in the All-Star
[31:31.380 --> 31:33.940]  game would get a free car, and Alex Ovechkin
[31:33.940 --> 31:35.600]  wanted the car, and he was vocal
[31:35.600 --> 31:37.500]  about it, and he got taken second
[31:37.500 --> 31:39.160]  to last and was fucking livid
[31:39.160 --> 31:41.740]  when he was taken, because he just wanted the car.
[31:43.460 --> 31:45.100]  That's my Alex Ovechkin fact.
[31:46.020 --> 31:47.480]  Give me a fact on
[31:47.480 --> 31:48.940]  Gabriel Landeskog.
[31:49.860 --> 31:51.240]  He got traded,
[31:51.580 --> 31:53.020]  I believe, a few years ago?
[31:53.180 --> 31:55.500]  I could be wrong about that. I think he moved
[31:55.500 --> 31:57.400]  and then they hated it, or there's always
[31:57.400 --> 31:59.240]  rumors of him getting traded. I don't know a lot
[31:59.240 --> 32:01.240]  about Gabriel Landeskog. I want to say he's an
[32:01.240 --> 32:03.560]  oiler, but that could be completely wrong. Well, let's find out.
[32:04.560 --> 32:05.200]  Nope, Avalanche.
[32:07.220 --> 32:07.540]  Jordan
[32:07.960 --> 32:08.280]  Bennington.
[32:10.380 --> 32:11.020]  Jordan Bennington.
[32:11.100 --> 32:12.940]  Bennington is a rich guy name. Yeah, big time.
[32:13.140 --> 32:14.260]  You'd expect a Bennington to
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.540]  live in the Hamptons. Yeah. He lives in St. Louis.
[32:21.220 --> 32:23.220]  Well, during the season he probably does,
[32:23.260 --> 32:24.680]  but who can afford to live in St. Louis?
[32:25.080 --> 32:26.380]  Just the kind of funny guys, apparently.
[32:27.400 --> 32:27.500]  Travis
[32:28.900 --> 32:30.860]  Conakney. Do the kind of funny
[32:30.860 --> 32:32.740]  guys live in St. Louis? San Francisco.
[32:33.620 --> 32:34.880]  That's a... what? Different place.
[32:35.100 --> 32:35.960]  Are you okay?
[32:36.240 --> 32:38.560]  I conflated San Francisco and St. Louis
[32:38.560 --> 32:40.260]  in my head. Are you having a stroke?
[32:40.340 --> 32:42.860]  But the way you said it to me was like, I was wrong,
[32:43.040 --> 32:44.140]  which made me go, what?
[32:44.900 --> 32:46.860]  Listen, if you're gonna be right,
[32:47.020 --> 32:48.540]  do it with confidence. If you're gonna be wrong,
[32:48.920 --> 32:50.760]  do it with confidence. Is the tooth
[32:50.760 --> 32:52.300]  infection heading to your brain? Maybe.
[32:53.720 --> 32:54.260]  That's enough.
[32:55.980 --> 32:56.300]  Matthew
[32:57.860 --> 32:58.180]  Barzall.
[32:59.720 --> 33:00.360]  San Francisco.
[33:00.740 --> 33:02.260]  Nothing? Okay.
[33:02.400 --> 33:04.080]  No, I got nothing on Matthew Barzall. Tyler
[33:04.080 --> 33:06.140]  Toffoli. I'm still processing San Francisco
[33:06.140 --> 33:08.160]  and St. Louis. You said that so
[33:08.160 --> 33:10.200]  confidently, I thought, oh, I didn't know they moved.
[33:10.200 --> 33:11.680]  Here's the deal. I didn't even question.
[33:12.000 --> 33:13.260]  Here's the deal, they both start with S.
[33:14.360 --> 33:16.520]  Yeah, no, we got it, man. Victor Arvidson.
[33:17.360 --> 33:18.340]  I have no idea who he is.
[33:18.480 --> 33:20.080]  Arvidson sounds like it would be a name for an aardvark.
[33:20.080 --> 33:21.000]  Drew Doughty.
[33:21.760 --> 33:24.040]  Drew Doughty has been in the NHL forever
[33:24.040 --> 33:25.720]  as a King. Do you hate him?
[33:26.240 --> 33:28.020]  You hate him? I hate him.
[33:28.180 --> 33:30.060]  Well, I was like the end, so the Canucks went
[33:30.060 --> 33:31.640]  to the Stanley Cup Final in 2011
[33:31.640 --> 33:34.180]  and then 2012, they won the President's
[33:34.180 --> 33:35.980]  Trophy, which is best regular season
[33:35.980 --> 33:38.100]  record, and they sucked for like most
[33:38.100 --> 33:39.960]  of the year, and everyone was like, oh, they'll come back in the playoffs,
[33:40.020 --> 33:42.260]  they didn't care, and then they got annihilated by the Kings.
[33:42.640 --> 33:44.040]  And Drew Doughty was ridiculous
[33:44.040 --> 33:45.380]  in that series, so I hate Drew Doughty.
[33:46.120 --> 33:48.080]  So don't be a Doughty
[33:48.080 --> 33:49.080]  Doughter, because he's good.
[33:50.420 --> 33:51.300]  Chris Kreider.
[33:52.180 --> 33:52.620]  Kreider.
[33:54.020 --> 33:55.120]  That's all I know about him.
[33:55.820 --> 33:57.320]  That's enough. It's pretty cool.
[33:58.980 --> 33:59.860]  Tim Stutzel.
[34:00.400 --> 34:01.960]  God, these hockey names are weird.
[34:03.140 --> 34:03.580]  Matt
[34:04.240 --> 34:06.020]  Zuccarello. That sounds like something we would
[34:06.020 --> 34:07.960]  order at Patrizia's. I like that jersey.
[34:09.380 --> 34:10.180]  That is a pretty jersey.
[34:10.320 --> 34:11.660]  Where is that? That is...
[34:11.660 --> 34:13.580]  Minnesota. Minnesota Wild.
[34:14.440 --> 34:15.060]  That's nice.
[34:15.060 --> 34:17.040]  Ty Smith.
[34:17.160 --> 34:18.320]  He's a devil.
[34:18.640 --> 34:20.060]  He is a devil.
[34:21.440 --> 34:22.200]  This...
[34:23.560 --> 34:24.320]  Brady
[34:25.060 --> 34:25.560]  Takakichuk.
[34:26.380 --> 34:28.560]  He looks surprised to be there.
[34:28.940 --> 34:30.920]  He does. He's like, oh.
[34:34.220 --> 34:35.140]  Him processing
[34:35.140 --> 34:36.120]  being a senator.
[34:37.300 --> 34:37.940]  Artemi
[34:39.020 --> 34:39.400]  Panarin.
[34:40.860 --> 34:41.380]  Don't eat him.
[34:41.380 --> 34:41.940]  Artemi Panarin.
[34:42.720 --> 34:44.660]  Jean-Gabriel Pagiot.
[34:45.820 --> 34:47.460]  That's a great three-name name.
[34:47.580 --> 34:48.460]  Yeah, big time.
[34:49.300 --> 34:50.020]  Jean-Gabriel.
[34:50.620 --> 34:51.660]  Jordan Eberle.
[34:53.100 --> 34:54.420]  He was an oiler.
[34:54.420 --> 34:57.300]  He was 100% an oiler that got traded to the Islanders.
[34:57.320 --> 34:57.600]  Oh yeah?
[34:58.440 --> 35:00.640]  Absolutely. That one I'm certain of.
[35:02.840 --> 35:03.360]  Jacob
[35:04.480 --> 35:05.000]  Voorhees.
[35:06.420 --> 35:06.940]  Ivan
[35:08.420 --> 35:08.940]  Pravnavarov.
[35:10.360 --> 35:10.840]  Pravarov.
[35:10.920 --> 35:12.700]  That sounds like a
[35:12.700 --> 35:14.100]  medicine you'd buy on TV.
[35:14.560 --> 35:15.040]  Pravarov.
[35:17.160 --> 35:18.800]  It's an A1C inhibitor.
[35:22.700 --> 35:23.180]  Jonathan
[35:24.400 --> 35:24.880]  Huberdow.
[35:26.040 --> 35:28.860]  I know there's a penalty for high sticks. A lot of low sticks
[35:28.860 --> 35:30.900]  in these cards. I'm trying to keep my eye out
[35:30.900 --> 35:31.880]  for high stick.
[35:33.300 --> 35:34.620]  Also, no shots.
[35:34.860 --> 35:36.180]  Ryan Nugent Hopkins.
[35:36.180 --> 35:39.100]  These are all really close shots
[35:39.100 --> 35:40.380]  of people not really
[35:41.160 --> 35:42.360]  actively working the puck.
[35:42.760 --> 35:44.400]  They're keeping their eye on the puck, so they look
[35:44.400 --> 35:45.640]  really focused.
[35:45.960 --> 35:46.600]  Phil Kessel.
[35:47.160 --> 35:48.020]  That's a good jersey.
[35:49.500 --> 35:52.220]  Phil Kessel of the Coyotes, who are in a
[35:52.220 --> 35:53.260]  stadium next year.
[35:53.300 --> 35:55.140]  We were talking about that, right?
[35:55.560 --> 35:57.300]  Yeah, they got kicked out of their stadium.
[35:57.540 --> 35:58.620]  Oh, this was the guys?
[35:59.900 --> 36:02.340]  Phil Kessel, notorious eater.
[36:02.880 --> 36:04.200]  I feel like all the stories you hear
[36:04.200 --> 36:06.060]  about Phil Kessel is that he just eats a lot
[36:06.060 --> 36:07.880]  and is kind of lazy, but he scores goals.
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.120]  Hey, you know what? If it works,
[36:10.180 --> 36:11.440]  it works, man. What are you going to do?
[36:12.140 --> 36:12.920]  Argue a success.
[36:15.280 --> 36:16.120]  Phillip Ronick.
[36:18.560 --> 36:20.360]  His last name looks like
[36:20.360 --> 36:22.400]  a combination I'd have in Scrabble
[36:22.400 --> 36:23.400]  and just feel fucked with.
[36:23.640 --> 36:26.420]  I have no idea what to build with that.
[36:27.640 --> 36:28.480]  Here's Evgeny
[36:28.900 --> 36:29.320]  Dadanov.
[36:30.340 --> 36:31.180]  Evgeny Dadanov.
[36:31.180 --> 36:32.400]  Another senator.
[36:32.740 --> 36:35.660]  The owner of the Senators is insane.
[36:36.160 --> 36:37.180]  There's a time where
[36:37.180 --> 36:39.200]  a player got injured and he hired
[36:39.200 --> 36:41.280]  a CSI investigation crew to try
[36:41.280 --> 36:43.140]  to prove that it was intentional.
[36:43.740 --> 36:45.020]  It wasn't. It was just a hockey play.
[36:45.380 --> 36:46.620]  What? It's a ridiculous franchise.
[36:46.880 --> 36:48.620]  That's awesome. They might be my favorite.
[36:49.920 --> 36:50.520]  Alex
[36:51.360 --> 36:52.640]  Dub! Brennicat.
[36:54.040 --> 36:55.520]  I hate the Blackhawks.
[36:56.280 --> 36:57.000]  Yeah, I hate them.
[36:57.720 --> 36:58.920]  Cole Caulfield.
[37:00.380 --> 37:01.180]  He looks...
[37:01.720 --> 37:03.460]  It's a rookie card, but he's an MVP.
[37:03.740 --> 37:05.240]  But how do you feel about the name Canadians?
[37:06.180 --> 37:06.440]  Andrew.
[37:06.520 --> 37:09.040]  Do all of their jerseys look like they have collars
[37:09.040 --> 37:09.720]  with ties?
[37:10.300 --> 37:11.900]  He's like a business hockey guy.
[37:13.520 --> 37:15.020]  There's a few different iterations
[37:15.020 --> 37:15.860]  of jersey style.
[37:16.980 --> 37:18.500]  On Chicago, they don't have that.
[37:18.680 --> 37:20.040]  I'm okay with the Canadians name.
[37:20.580 --> 37:23.120]  They're an East Coast team. I don't think about them all that much.
[37:24.160 --> 37:24.860]  What about the
[37:24.860 --> 37:26.400]  Canucks? Is that the same thing?
[37:26.400 --> 37:27.040]  That's Montreal.
[37:28.600 --> 37:30.020]  The Canucks are Vancouver.
[37:30.960 --> 37:31.580]  Do you like them?
[37:32.040 --> 37:33.860]  I love them. They're great.
[37:34.140 --> 37:35.720]  Well, they're terrible, but I like them.
[37:35.880 --> 37:37.600]  Montreal, the Maple Leafs?
[37:37.720 --> 37:40.360]  That's Toronto Maple Leafs, the Vancouver Canucks.
[37:40.840 --> 37:42.200]  The Canadians are who?
[37:42.780 --> 37:43.260]  Montreal.
[37:44.560 --> 37:46.200]  And the Ottawa Senators?
[37:46.340 --> 37:46.660]  Is that right?
[37:47.600 --> 37:49.840]  Do you call them the Habs or something?
[37:50.500 --> 37:51.560]  Yeah, that's also a name for them.
[37:51.740 --> 37:52.840]  The Habs and the Havnots.
[37:52.840 --> 37:54.500]  Mike Hoffman.
[37:54.580 --> 37:55.980]  That's a baseball name.
[37:56.440 --> 37:57.480]  It is a baseball name.
[37:57.800 --> 38:00.080]  Oh, this is good for me.
[38:00.780 --> 38:02.780]  Patrice Bergeron. Before and after.
[38:02.960 --> 38:03.400]  It's a parallel.
[38:03.640 --> 38:06.540]  This is before he had a mask and after he had a mask?
[38:06.820 --> 38:07.480]  Yeah, it's before mask after mask.
[38:09.720 --> 38:10.500]  He's a Bruins.
[38:11.480 --> 38:11.960]  Go Bruins.
[38:12.320 --> 38:15.120]  Is there any explanation of what the before is?
[38:15.680 --> 38:16.340]  Before the game?
[38:16.800 --> 38:18.160]  Bergeron and the Bruins wore
[38:18.660 --> 38:20.620]  1990s garb prior to winning the NHL
[38:20.620 --> 38:22.420]  outdoor Sunday game in Lake Tahoe
[38:22.420 --> 38:23.780]  on February 21st, 2021.
[38:24.180 --> 38:26.020]  So that doesn't have anything to do with the...
[38:26.020 --> 38:26.760]  No, not a fucking thing at all.
[38:27.240 --> 38:30.760]  Hey, do you want to take something
[38:30.760 --> 38:31.940]  before you get into the next pack?
[38:32.120 --> 38:33.840]  Do you want to take something from our mailbag?
[38:33.960 --> 38:36.000]  Oh, should we do? Let's start on a new segment.
[38:36.180 --> 38:38.000]  So I mentioned that if y'all wanted to send
[38:38.540 --> 38:40.400]  Infinity Towel merchandise or pits
[38:40.400 --> 38:42.200]  to us, we would take it. And then we just
[38:42.200 --> 38:44.580]  got a bunch of stuff in the mail. So let's see what it is.
[38:44.580 --> 38:45.080]  Let's see what we got.
[38:46.040 --> 38:47.340]  We haven't really checked any of it.
[38:47.340 --> 38:48.920]  I haven't really checked any of it. Here's a box.
[38:50.160 --> 38:51.300]  And let's see what's in it.
[38:51.300 --> 38:53.340]  I hope it's... Oh! It's a bunch
[38:53.340 --> 38:55.540]  of Desert Storm cards from...
[38:55.540 --> 38:57.500]  I think there might have been a note at some point, but all my shit
[38:57.500 --> 38:58.040]  got messed up.
[39:00.360 --> 39:01.340]  Steve! Steve Wall.
[39:01.920 --> 39:03.440]  Steve, I'm going to put some of these in the
[39:03.440 --> 39:05.420]  packs now. Thank you. Put some of these
[39:05.420 --> 39:07.200]  others down here. We'll open these three packs
[39:07.200 --> 39:08.820]  of Desert Storm cards. Thanks, Steve.
[39:09.300 --> 39:11.280]  So we're looking for thousand yard stair
[39:11.280 --> 39:13.380]  cards? Oh, we haven't gotten that far yet.
[39:13.940 --> 39:15.100]  What are we looking for here?
[39:15.100 --> 39:17.080]  What? That one's to Eric.
[39:17.360 --> 39:18.660]  This one's to Geoffy. Oh, okay.
[39:19.160 --> 39:21.420]  Here we go. We have Military Asset.
[39:21.480 --> 39:23.180]  There's an M1. This is
[39:23.180 --> 39:25.180]  an Abrams Main Battle Tank.
[39:25.260 --> 39:27.080]  This is an M1A1. Abrams
[39:27.080 --> 39:29.140]  Main Battle Tank. I have spent... I slept...
[39:30.260 --> 39:31.180]  One of the best
[39:31.180 --> 39:33.320]  nights of sleep I've had in my entire
[39:33.320 --> 39:35.180]  life. Somebody just got
[39:35.180 --> 39:37.160]  shot. Rip. One of the best nights
[39:37.160 --> 39:39.060]  of sleep I've had in my entire life, I was at the National
[39:39.060 --> 39:40.740]  Training Center in Fort Irwin, California.
[39:40.980 --> 39:42.800]  And I was doing a piece on tankers.
[39:42.800 --> 39:44.760]  And I overnighted with them.
[39:45.100 --> 39:46.920]  And they were on maneuvers. And so
[39:46.920 --> 39:48.980]  we slept on the side of a
[39:48.980 --> 39:50.600]  cliff in the desert
[39:50.600 --> 39:52.660]  on top of the tank. And it was like
[39:53.360 --> 39:54.960]  I want to say like 75 degrees.
[39:55.280 --> 39:56.900]  And the stars were insane
[39:56.900 --> 39:59.040]  because we were in the middle of nowhere. And I just...
[39:59.040 --> 40:00.860]  And I was sitting in my sleeping bag, laying on my
[40:00.860 --> 40:02.840]  sleeping bag on top of a tank. It was...
[40:02.840 --> 40:04.660]  I will think about that night occasionally
[40:04.660 --> 40:06.760]  for the rest of my life. Is it the sleeping bag we still have?
[40:08.920 --> 40:09.240]  No.
[40:09.360 --> 40:10.520]  But I did have that blanket.
[40:10.520 --> 40:12.180]  The blanket we covered the plants with.
[40:12.380 --> 40:13.020]  That was there.
[40:14.740 --> 40:16.420]  I don't know shit about this.
[40:16.660 --> 40:17.720]  USS John F. Kennedy.
[40:18.040 --> 40:19.040]  I was not in the Navy.
[40:20.840 --> 40:21.320]  Congress!
[40:22.380 --> 40:23.320]  What's up!
[40:24.580 --> 40:25.060]  Government!
[40:26.160 --> 40:27.980]  There used to be a parking lot out front.
[40:28.080 --> 40:29.540]  That's not like that anymore.
[40:30.120 --> 40:31.780]  I don't think you can get that close anymore.
[40:31.940 --> 40:32.340]  Probably not.
[40:34.440 --> 40:34.920]  Congress!
[40:36.560 --> 40:38.560]  Here's the United Nations resolutions.
[40:38.560 --> 40:39.100]  Beautiful.
[40:39.800 --> 40:42.080]  That looks like every picture of the United Nations
[40:42.080 --> 40:44.440]  that you ever see in a cartoon or a movie.
[40:44.860 --> 40:45.360]  I got a hint.
[40:46.340 --> 40:47.840]  Put it at the bottom.
[40:48.580 --> 40:50.600]  Here's an FB-11 Aardvark.
[40:50.900 --> 40:52.300]  The plane's called the Aardvark?
[40:52.360 --> 40:53.440]  Yeah, the Aardvark 111.
[40:54.080 --> 40:55.360]  It's a warbird.
[40:55.920 --> 40:58.440]  Here we go. Military skill.
[40:59.300 --> 40:59.900]  Range.
[41:00.800 --> 41:02.380]  That's the Cowboys stadium.
[41:02.380 --> 41:03.320]  The old Cowboys stadium.
[41:03.820 --> 41:06.100]  I don't know why.
[41:06.900 --> 41:07.340]  Range.
[41:07.700 --> 41:09.540]  Is there anything on the back of it?
[41:09.600 --> 41:10.080]  Yeah, probably.
[41:11.280 --> 41:13.660]  Estimating the range or distance of objects
[41:13.660 --> 41:15.720]  is one of the most difficult and indispensable
[41:15.720 --> 41:17.200]  skills for a soldier to learn.
[41:17.340 --> 41:18.560]  They didn't teach me that when I was in the Army.
[41:18.880 --> 41:20.880]  U.S. soldiers often estimate the number of
[41:20.880 --> 41:22.980]  American football field lengths, 100 yards or
[41:22.980 --> 41:24.860]  91 meters, to judge distance.
[41:25.080 --> 41:26.100]  How many dinklages?
[41:26.980 --> 41:28.340]  That's a lot of dinklages.
[41:30.380 --> 41:32.100]  Here's the United Service
[41:32.100 --> 41:34.420]  Organization intelligence file.
[41:34.420 --> 41:35.960]  That looks like Norman Schwarzkopf.
[41:36.620 --> 41:38.760]  He's recreating that Cher music video.
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.180]  If he could turn back time.
[41:42.720 --> 41:43.160]  Spain.
[41:44.960 --> 41:45.400]  Geography.
[41:46.400 --> 41:48.600]  Spain and Congress are neck and neck for my favorite
[41:48.600 --> 41:49.260]  cards so far.
[41:50.960 --> 41:51.400]  Bahrain.
[41:52.720 --> 41:54.480]  That's just a picture of a map.
[41:55.180 --> 41:55.800]  Bahrain is there.
[41:56.040 --> 41:58.360]  They could have just said Kuwait or Yemen.
[41:58.720 --> 42:00.740]  I spent a year of my life there.
[42:01.060 --> 42:02.580]  I spent a little bit of time
[42:02.580 --> 42:04.180]  right in between those two.
[42:04.340 --> 42:06.380]  I spent a bunch of time over here.
[42:06.940 --> 42:08.100]  Touched over there a little bit.
[42:08.160 --> 42:10.640]  My life was spent in the Middle East there.
[42:11.440 --> 42:12.660]  And boom! The final
[42:12.660 --> 42:13.560]  hit from Andrew.
[42:15.080 --> 42:15.720]  Oh shit!
[42:16.500 --> 42:16.820]  Canada!
[42:18.240 --> 42:19.220]  I don't know how you salute.
[42:19.820 --> 42:21.880]  Are you allowed to salute in Canada? I don't know how it works.
[42:22.580 --> 42:23.740]  Anyway, there's some Mounties.
[42:24.340 --> 42:26.220]  Geography. I'll mail this to you, Andrew.
[42:26.300 --> 42:28.200]  It's pretty cool. It's a great uniform.
[42:28.420 --> 42:30.500]  Two more of those. I feel like we got most of the
[42:30.500 --> 42:32.500]  comedy out of this. Yeah, I definitely agree.
[42:32.640 --> 42:34.160]  Let's do one more. We have 19 more.
[42:39.150 --> 42:40.530]  What was the map card?
[42:40.890 --> 42:42.070]  Was that Kuwait? It was Bahrain.
[42:43.370 --> 42:44.370]  Bahrain. Here we go.
[42:44.870 --> 42:46.670]  M60 main battle tank. Never heard of it.
[42:47.150 --> 42:48.230]  Is that a different tank?
[42:48.410 --> 42:50.590]  Yeah, it's a M60. I don't know it. We weren't using those.
[42:51.130 --> 42:52.790]  Fitness. Working on my
[42:52.790 --> 42:54.030]  fitness like Fergie.
[42:54.450 --> 42:55.870]  These cards rule.
[42:57.370 --> 42:58.790]  It feels like it's supposed to
[42:58.790 --> 43:00.750]  be for a board game. It's like, oh, I have fitness in Spain.
[43:00.750 --> 43:02.710]  U.S. Marine
[43:02.710 --> 43:04.230]  Warrior personnel.
[43:04.570 --> 43:06.170]  That's pretty hardcore.
[43:07.130 --> 43:08.030]  There's Yemen.
[43:08.890 --> 43:10.790]  But also, there's Bahrain.
[43:11.090 --> 43:11.970]  Yeah, there's Bahrain again.
[43:13.030 --> 43:13.570]  Argentina.
[43:14.690 --> 43:16.390]  Why is it blue?
[43:17.030 --> 43:18.730]  It is blue, actually. Is it because of the flag
[43:18.730 --> 43:20.730]  color? But why isn't
[43:20.730 --> 43:22.230]  the other card colored?
[43:22.790 --> 43:24.730]  Bahrain is black. Or Yemen is black.
[43:25.210 --> 43:26.470]  Because there's black on their flag?
[43:26.510 --> 43:28.570]  The first one. Erica's right.
[43:28.570 --> 43:31.210]  There was no color on the first one.
[43:31.210 --> 43:32.290]  Bahrain is a colorless
[43:32.290 --> 43:34.090]  country, I guess.
[43:34.690 --> 43:35.990]  No, it is colored. It's red.
[43:36.270 --> 43:38.330]  Oh, it's very small. I see.
[43:39.230 --> 43:39.750]  So, so small.
[43:40.990 --> 43:42.550]  Here we go. The A6
[43:42.550 --> 43:44.030]  Intruder. Those are cool planes.
[43:44.350 --> 43:46.310]  You're good at identifying war planes.
[43:46.950 --> 43:48.250]  Yeah, he's reading right off the card.
[43:48.270 --> 43:50.210]  No, I'm saying in general. When we'll be somewhere
[43:50.210 --> 43:52.530]  if there's a military helicopter coming up,
[43:52.570 --> 43:53.990]  you'll be like, oh, that's a...
[43:53.990 --> 43:56.730]  Oh, yeah. Well, it's been a long five years.
[43:56.730 --> 43:58.590]  You're good at identifying that stuff.
[43:58.690 --> 44:01.030]  When you're just out there and you're looking, you go, there's
[44:01.030 --> 44:02.850]  that one again. You'll be like, I think that's an Apache
[44:02.850 --> 44:04.690]  or that's... Like when we were at F1, you knew
[44:04.690 --> 44:05.750]  what they were and stuff. Yeah, for sure.
[44:06.450 --> 44:08.410]  Women in combat. Love to see it.
[44:08.970 --> 44:10.430]  Equality. She can do it all.
[44:10.650 --> 44:11.350]  She absolutely can.
[44:12.790 --> 44:13.870]  United States Navy.
[44:14.930 --> 44:16.730]  If you guys aren't on the
[44:17.150 --> 44:18.530]  subreddit Heavy Seas,
[44:18.810 --> 44:20.430]  I highly recommend it.
[44:20.510 --> 44:22.170]  It is an entire subreddit of videos
[44:22.170 --> 44:25.050]  of boats like this getting destroyed
[44:25.050 --> 44:26.610]  by waves. It's fucking awesome.
[44:27.290 --> 44:29.150]  Oh, shit. It's coming back.
[44:29.470 --> 44:30.610]  Today is your day, buddy.
[44:31.170 --> 44:32.390]  Here we go. China.
[44:32.910 --> 44:33.510]  China!
[44:35.110 --> 44:36.830]  Why am I China?
[44:36.970 --> 44:38.430]  You're not. Final card.
[44:39.070 --> 44:40.910]  Canadian National Anthem.
[44:42.590 --> 44:43.490]  Totem pole.
[44:44.010 --> 44:47.050]  Oh, Canada.
[44:47.710 --> 44:48.410]  Oh, Canada.
[44:48.570 --> 44:50.990]  Let me show you this thing that Jake C.
[44:51.150 --> 44:52.010]  sent to me.
[44:53.490 --> 44:55.070]  Oh, it's a Bip Roberts!
[44:55.090 --> 44:56.130]  Got a Bip Roberts.
[44:56.570 --> 44:58.250]  That is considered one of the
[44:58.790 --> 45:00.090]  best baseball cards of all time.
[45:00.110 --> 45:01.230]  I love this. Thank you, Jay.
[45:01.610 --> 45:02.490]  Jay, that was sweet of you.
[45:03.310 --> 45:05.150]  Here's one to me from
[45:06.230 --> 45:06.590]  Drew.
[45:07.990 --> 45:09.010]  Oh, Drew sent a letter.
[45:09.210 --> 45:10.370]  Let me make sure it's okay to read it.
[45:11.910 --> 45:14.190]  Dear Geoff, let these cards be a small token
[45:14.190 --> 45:16.030]  of appreciation and gratitude for the 10 plus
[45:16.030 --> 45:17.310]  years of entertainment you've provided me.
[45:17.370 --> 45:19.510]  Love you on the drunk tank and continue to follow
[45:19.510 --> 45:20.650]  your shenanigans today through.
[45:21.910 --> 45:23.450]  Nice. I'm lost in the
[45:23.450 --> 45:25.530]  Zimmer zone and hope I never get
[45:25.530 --> 45:27.310]  found. Much love from
[45:27.310 --> 45:29.530]  Sudbury, Ontario. You ever been to Sudbury,
[45:29.710 --> 45:30.070]  Ontario?
[45:31.210 --> 45:33.370]  No, I haven't. Give it a shot.
[45:33.590 --> 45:35.410]  Give it a chance sometime. It sounds too British
[45:35.410 --> 45:37.830]  to be a Canadian place. Sudbury.
[45:38.030 --> 45:39.510]  See? It really
[45:39.510 --> 45:41.070]  fits. It's where they make soap bubbles.
[45:41.810 --> 45:43.590]  Sudbury. They grow on the vine.
[45:44.350 --> 45:45.270]  I'm from the Manchester
[45:45.270 --> 45:46.010]  Sudburys.
[45:47.150 --> 45:48.030]  Okay, and
[45:48.030 --> 45:49.430]  he gave us, me,
[45:50.190 --> 45:51.290]  a silver prism,
[45:52.410 --> 45:53.730]  and then a base.
[45:54.010 --> 45:56.010]  Oh, this is perfect. That's actually a
[45:56.010 --> 45:58.170]  great gift. Thank you. You can see here's a base.
[45:58.350 --> 45:59.570]  It's still shiny, right?
[46:01.130 --> 46:01.870]  And then the
[46:01.870 --> 46:04.110]  prism you can see is extra shiny.
[46:04.530 --> 46:06.090]  And these are about 10 times
[46:06.090 --> 46:07.930]  rarer than this. So
[46:07.930 --> 46:09.970]  if you're getting a rookie card or whatever, you always want to go for
[46:09.970 --> 46:11.850]  the silver prism. It's considered like the
[46:11.850 --> 46:13.950]  best card to get. Next to like a
[46:13.950 --> 46:15.610]  one of one or an auto, but if you're just looking for
[46:15.610 --> 46:17.950]  like a base card, get the prism
[46:17.950 --> 46:19.550]  version. It's so much cooler.
[46:19.970 --> 46:21.330]  Wow. We got
[46:21.330 --> 46:23.890]  some stuff here. This is from
[46:23.890 --> 46:24.810]  Troy and Alicia.
[46:26.190 --> 46:28.170]  We got some young guns.
[46:28.410 --> 46:29.010]  Oh, shit.
[46:29.670 --> 46:31.950]  We also got, I don't know what that is.
[46:33.830 --> 46:34.990]  It's Denny's cards.
[46:36.330 --> 46:37.690]  Denny's cards? Oh, shit!
[46:38.150 --> 46:40.070]  Well, they sent us Game of Thrones
[46:40.070 --> 46:42.010]  Pez. They were just cleaning out their garage, weren't they?
[46:42.930 --> 46:44.010]  Oh, we got some old
[46:44.010 --> 46:45.750]  hoops. Love that. 89 hoops.
[46:48.090 --> 46:48.490]  And...
[46:49.050 --> 46:49.450]  Oh!
[46:50.450 --> 46:51.830]  Tops. Holiday.
[46:52.710 --> 46:54.030]  Those are hard. Is this holiday?
[46:54.450 --> 46:55.430]  Looks like it. I think so.
[46:55.930 --> 46:58.050]  There you go. A 2020 holiday. And then look at
[46:58.050 --> 47:00.450]  these Game of Thrones Pez dispensers.
[47:00.590 --> 47:01.870]  Wow! We'll see if you can name them all.
[47:01.870 --> 47:03.950]  The cool thing about that is the further you get down
[47:03.950 --> 47:05.850]  the Pez thing, the worse the candy tastes.
[47:06.130 --> 47:07.350]  That's a really great...
[47:07.930 --> 47:09.490]  That season 9 candy is the worst.
[47:09.490 --> 47:11.630]  Here we have Daenerys Targaryen.
[47:12.090 --> 47:13.330]  We have, I think, Jon Snow.
[47:13.870 --> 47:14.530]  Then we have...
[47:14.530 --> 47:16.750]  The Dinkmeister.
[47:17.230 --> 47:19.410]  Dinklebot, whose name was...
[47:19.410 --> 47:20.330]  What was his name in Game of Thrones?
[47:21.550 --> 47:23.170]  Tyrion. Tyrion Lannister.
[47:23.810 --> 47:24.870]  And then...
[47:25.410 --> 47:27.170]  That dude. White Walker?
[47:27.170 --> 47:29.110]  White Walker guy. I want to call him Snow King.
[47:29.430 --> 47:29.970]  Snow King.
[47:30.990 --> 47:31.550]  That's awesome.
[47:34.050 --> 47:35.810]  Let's... Here, I'm gonna hold off on...
[47:35.810 --> 47:36.970]  We can't get to all of everything.
[47:36.970 --> 47:38.390]  So I'm gonna hold off on the hockey.
[47:38.530 --> 47:40.570]  And we'll open this basketball.
[47:40.870 --> 47:41.690]  What is the basketball?
[47:42.510 --> 47:43.830]  What happened to the Denny's cards?
[47:44.770 --> 47:45.410]  We'll get to them.
[47:46.410 --> 47:48.050]  This is Hoops. NBA Hoops.
[47:48.350 --> 47:50.850]  89. So I think this is the first
[47:50.850 --> 47:52.870]  year of Hoops cards, if I remember
[47:52.870 --> 47:54.930]  correctly. This is in the middle.
[47:55.030 --> 47:56.970]  As a matter of fact, we have a famous Hoops card.
[47:57.430 --> 47:58.350]  It's one of the first
[47:58.820 --> 48:01.070]  Fuckface official cards.
[48:01.670 --> 48:02.910]  It's the Fred Roberts
[48:02.910 --> 48:04.630]  card. It's an 89 Hoops card.
[48:04.630 --> 48:06.330]  I know I have it in here somewhere.
[48:06.410 --> 48:07.970]  Here it is. It's one of the first.
[48:08.190 --> 48:08.850]  This is the big
[48:10.910 --> 48:11.310]  brown.
[48:11.670 --> 48:13.810]  It was pre-Anthony Davis.
[48:14.090 --> 48:14.590]  I do, I do.
[48:16.070 --> 48:18.250]  So we do have... That's what this is.
[48:19.590 --> 48:20.570]  Let's see what we get.
[48:21.190 --> 48:21.910]  Could be David Robinson.
[48:22.250 --> 48:24.010]  Rookie. Could be Michael Jordan card.
[48:24.210 --> 48:26.370]  Could be Larry Bird, Magic Johnson.
[48:26.530 --> 48:27.330]  It was Golden Arrow.
[48:28.610 --> 48:29.350]  Could be nothing.
[48:30.450 --> 48:31.250]  Robert Reed!
[48:31.250 --> 48:33.150]  Larry Nance.
[48:33.270 --> 48:35.230]  Larry Nance's son, Larry
[48:35.230 --> 48:37.150]  Nance Jr., I believe
[48:37.150 --> 48:39.670]  just got traded to
[48:41.230 --> 48:42.030]  Portland.
[48:43.970 --> 48:44.450]  Or...
[48:45.250 --> 48:46.050]  New Orleans.
[48:47.050 --> 48:48.430]  Michael Thompson.
[48:48.970 --> 48:51.330]  Frank Johnson. Terry Catledge.
[48:51.590 --> 48:52.710]  Dale Ellis.
[48:53.550 --> 48:55.390]  Is that coming to him
[48:55.390 --> 48:56.270]  or away from him?
[48:56.910 --> 48:58.650]  He's looking at the basketball going, damn.
[48:58.650 --> 48:59.630]  He's on all of it.
[49:00.410 --> 49:00.890]  No.
[49:03.630 --> 49:04.590]  Bob Hanson.
[49:04.990 --> 49:06.650]  Chuck Persson.
[49:07.470 --> 49:08.710]  Okay, Chuck Persson
[49:08.710 --> 49:10.770]  is a name that Andrew would make up
[49:10.770 --> 49:11.950]  on the spot when
[49:12.450 --> 49:13.270]  you push him.
[49:13.590 --> 49:16.810]  He'd go, Chuck Persson.
[49:17.830 --> 49:18.690]  It looks like one
[49:18.690 --> 49:19.630]  of my list items.
[49:20.290 --> 49:21.910]  Let's put that over there. Here we go.
[49:22.390 --> 49:24.570]  Geoff Kontchak. I don't know who that is.
[49:25.190 --> 49:26.710]  Oh, this is a legit hit.
[49:26.710 --> 49:28.910]  Fucking Dennis Rodman.
[49:29.110 --> 49:30.730]  Nice. That's his early
[49:30.730 --> 49:31.270]  years stuff.
[49:32.130 --> 49:34.190]  With the pistons.
[49:34.350 --> 49:36.190]  There's a reason he was a defensive player.
[49:37.690 --> 49:38.650]  Jesus Christ.
[49:38.790 --> 49:40.590]  He was phenomenal. Joe Wolf.
[49:40.810 --> 49:42.650]  Dan Shays. Paul Pressey.
[49:43.010 --> 49:44.470]  Scott Brooks, I believe
[49:44.470 --> 49:46.610]  is a coach now. That looks like
[49:46.610 --> 49:47.970]  a jersey that doesn't fit him.
[49:48.850 --> 49:50.570]  He looks like he's wearing papa's clothes.
[49:50.590 --> 49:52.430]  Billy Thompson from the Heat. Very cool.
[49:52.590 --> 49:54.590]  Thank you for sending those. Let's check out those
[49:54.590 --> 49:56.150]  Denny's cards. Let's do it.
[49:56.970 --> 49:58.530]  You think there will be a hack
[49:58.530 --> 50:00.170]  in this pack of Denny's cards?
[50:02.650 --> 50:04.030]  There's going to be a hack?
[50:04.130 --> 50:06.330]  A hack. A secret. A menu
[50:06.330 --> 50:08.230]  hack. I don't know what the pack is.
[50:08.430 --> 50:09.590]  What is...
[50:09.590 --> 50:11.190]  Are the cards sponsored?
[50:12.430 --> 50:14.910]  Oh, they're lenticular. There's a Greg Maddox.
[50:15.290 --> 50:16.590]  Oh, wow! It's a thing where
[50:16.590 --> 50:18.610]  you can throw the baseball, kind of.
[50:19.410 --> 50:20.130]  That's fun.
[50:20.750 --> 50:22.550]  I thought it was just going to be a plate of
[50:22.550 --> 50:24.030]  bacon and then a waffle.
[50:24.210 --> 50:26.470]  I thought Denny's cards meant something
[50:26.470 --> 50:27.570]  different.
[50:28.430 --> 50:30.610]  These are cooler than Denny's
[50:30.610 --> 50:31.390]  should have released.
[50:32.430 --> 50:33.510]  Frank Thomas.
[50:34.930 --> 50:36.330]  That man
[50:36.330 --> 50:37.710]  sells dick pills now.
[50:38.220 --> 50:39.490]  Him and Doug Flutie.
[50:40.670 --> 50:42.070]  Albert Bell.
[50:43.090 --> 50:44.010]  He was a great player, too.
[50:44.570 --> 50:45.690]  Mo Vaughn.
[50:46.450 --> 50:48.570]  These are awesome
[50:48.570 --> 50:50.010]  cards. Awesome players.
[50:50.010 --> 50:51.130]  These are cool.
[50:52.890 --> 50:53.770]  Texas son,
[50:53.910 --> 50:54.570]  Geoff Bagwell.
[50:55.490 --> 50:56.250]  Loves him.
[50:57.250 --> 50:59.030]  You know who I thought must have hated Geoff Bagwell?
[50:59.270 --> 51:01.570]  Craig Biggio. For sure, right?
[51:02.750 --> 51:03.910]  Because Biggio was good
[51:03.910 --> 51:05.990]  and then Bagwell showed up and was like, nobody cares about you anymore.
[51:06.030 --> 51:07.910]  He was definitely not the guy
[51:07.910 --> 51:09.150]  on that team. He was Bagwell's team.
[51:09.190 --> 51:11.290]  Growing up in the Houston area,
[51:11.650 --> 51:13.790]  everybody had a Biggio jersey.
[51:13.950 --> 51:14.410]  Until Bagwell.
[51:14.830 --> 51:15.790]  I don't know.
[51:15.790 --> 51:17.730]  I guess you would know better
[51:17.730 --> 51:18.750]  because you were from Houston.
[51:19.890 --> 51:20.770]  Jay Beutner.
[51:21.710 --> 51:22.790]  Oh, fuck, here we go.
[51:24.710 --> 51:25.590]  Barry Bonds.
[51:26.490 --> 51:27.830]  Never get in the Hall of Fame.
[51:27.910 --> 51:29.210]  Never get in the Hall of Fame, unfortunately.
[51:30.670 --> 51:31.890]  Because he's the guy
[51:31.890 --> 51:33.490]  who did the records but did the steroids.
[51:34.730 --> 51:35.170]  Example.
[51:35.410 --> 51:37.810]  He broke Hank Aaron's home run record.
[51:39.030 --> 51:39.890]  But he was all
[51:39.890 --> 51:40.410]  steroided.
[51:41.690 --> 51:43.650]  But so was Maguire.
[51:43.650 --> 51:44.930]  So was everybody.
[51:45.810 --> 51:47.010]  It's a Pete Rose thing.
[51:47.770 --> 51:49.250]  Did Pete Rose get it too?
[51:49.570 --> 51:51.690]  Well, Pete Rose bet against the Reds
[51:51.690 --> 51:52.470]  while he was coaching.
[51:52.990 --> 51:53.750]  Lifetime band.
[51:54.690 --> 51:57.050]  But if you want to see Pete Rose, he is in Vegas every Saturday.
[51:57.430 --> 51:59.710]  He'll write whatever you want on a baseball
[51:59.710 --> 52:00.270]  if you pay him.
[52:02.650 --> 52:03.610]  Hideo Nomo.
[52:03.730 --> 52:04.770]  Oh man, dude.
[52:04.970 --> 52:06.270]  He had the coolest wind-up.
[52:06.970 --> 52:08.730]  Is that what that is?
[52:10.410 --> 52:11.550]  He would turn
[52:11.550 --> 52:12.310]  his whole back.
[52:12.610 --> 52:14.910]  I was a huge fan of Kirby Puckett.
[52:15.050 --> 52:16.770]  I hate the fucking twins.
[52:17.090 --> 52:18.110]  I'm a White Sox fan.
[52:19.670 --> 52:21.190]  Absolutely love Kirby Puckett.
[52:21.950 --> 52:22.870]  Gary Sheffield.
[52:23.130 --> 52:24.710]  This is my entire childhood right here.
[52:24.730 --> 52:26.230]  Gary Sheffield on the Marlins too.
[52:26.750 --> 52:28.050]  That's true. Not the Brewers.
[52:30.910 --> 52:31.830]  Barry Larkin.
[52:32.110 --> 52:33.270]  I was never a huge Barry Larkin fan.
[52:33.410 --> 52:34.490]  No, but he was always that
[52:34.490 --> 52:36.470]  he's-out-there-everyday-playing-hard kind of guy.
[52:37.930 --> 52:39.130]  Boss Hogg himself.
[52:39.130 --> 52:39.910]  Wade Boggs.
[52:39.990 --> 52:42.430]  Look at that. What's his hand doing?
[52:42.510 --> 52:44.890]  Everything about his look.
[52:45.010 --> 52:45.710]  He's throwing.
[52:46.930 --> 52:48.790]  He's drinking 70 beers
[52:48.790 --> 52:49.710]  while he's swinging around.
[52:50.590 --> 52:51.470]  Oh, fuck!
[52:52.230 --> 52:53.050]  This is for you right here.
[52:53.990 --> 52:54.370]  Tony Gwynn.
[52:56.450 --> 52:58.510]  One of the greatest baseball players.
[52:58.790 --> 53:01.310]  One of the greatest hitters of all time.
[53:01.390 --> 53:03.190]  Would have broken 400 if they didn't
[53:03.190 --> 53:03.850]  strike in 94.
[53:05.190 --> 53:05.930]  Unheard of.
[53:06.430 --> 53:06.850]  Goddamn.
[53:08.610 --> 53:09.090]  Is that a
[53:09.770 --> 53:11.310]  Padres jersey? It looks like Dodgers.
[53:12.390 --> 53:13.310]  That's back in the
[53:14.090 --> 53:15.950]  90s when they wanted them to look like the Mets.
[53:16.150 --> 53:16.770]  It was fucking terrible.
[53:16.890 --> 53:19.670]  Tim Salmon. Swimming upstream.
[53:21.190 --> 53:21.990]  Lame-ass joke.
[53:23.570 --> 53:24.410]  Jason Israhausen.
[53:24.490 --> 53:25.510]  I don't actually know who that is.
[53:26.590 --> 53:27.290]  There you go.
[53:28.590 --> 53:29.430]  Cecil Fielder.
[53:29.730 --> 53:31.110]  There you go.
[53:31.290 --> 53:32.630]  There's a lot of cards in these facts.
[53:32.630 --> 53:34.390]  Yeah, there's a lot. Denny's really made them.
[53:34.550 --> 53:35.950]  I think it might be a whole set.
[53:36.730 --> 53:38.910]  There's only 28 cards, so I think this is all of them.
[53:39.810 --> 53:40.530]  Dante Bichette.
[53:40.790 --> 53:41.110]  Okay.
[53:42.750 --> 53:44.310]  Ozzie Smith. There you go.
[53:44.490 --> 53:46.390]  Is he doing a flip? Probably, yes.
[53:46.710 --> 53:47.410]  Yeah, probably.
[53:48.310 --> 53:50.490]  Is that his signature thing? He would do backflips.
[53:50.570 --> 53:52.130]  Yeah, he'd do a backflip. Yvonne Rodriguez.
[53:52.490 --> 53:54.150]  Shortstop. He's one of the best shortstops of all time.
[53:54.590 --> 53:55.610]  There's Big Pudge.
[53:56.170 --> 53:56.830]  There we go.
[53:58.330 --> 53:59.050]  Kevin Apier.
[54:01.050 --> 54:01.690]  Joe Carter.
[54:01.690 --> 54:03.390]  Joe Carter. Another great fucking player.
[54:03.650 --> 54:04.510]  Love Joe Carter.
[54:05.230 --> 54:06.170]  Moses Alou.
[54:06.530 --> 54:07.810]  Also love Moses Alou.
[54:08.310 --> 54:10.450]  Really is a who's who.
[54:11.050 --> 54:13.910]  These are like the big hitters, man.
[54:14.010 --> 54:15.530]  Speaking of steroids, there's Big Mac right there.
[54:15.530 --> 54:15.910]  There you go, baby.
[54:17.430 --> 54:18.590]  Right at that.
[54:18.590 --> 54:21.230]  That Bash Brothers long hair, but he's getting big.
[54:21.750 --> 54:24.230]  Did you ever watch that Bash Brothers thing that Lonely Island did?
[54:24.310 --> 54:24.910]  Yep. It was awesome.
[54:25.030 --> 54:25.630]  It was really good.
[54:25.630 --> 54:26.170]  It was very good.
[54:27.830 --> 54:28.550]  Kevin Seitzer.
[54:29.170 --> 54:30.830]  Look at that little... he's like looking over his shoulder.
[54:31.010 --> 54:32.390]  He's got a little juicy booty, doesn't he?
[54:32.550 --> 54:33.430]  Give me a little Seitzer.
[54:33.730 --> 54:34.510]  You like that?
[54:37.030 --> 54:37.930]  He's a thick boy.
[54:39.090 --> 54:39.810]  Darren Dalton.
[54:42.130 --> 54:42.850]  Jay Bell.
[54:43.190 --> 54:43.370]  Alright.
[54:43.710 --> 54:45.010]  Oh, that's cool.
[54:45.150 --> 54:45.970]  That's one of the better ones.
[54:47.350 --> 54:49.310]  So this is like the best of the 90s, basically?
[54:49.550 --> 54:53.850]  Yeah, that's like a real 1996 kind of.
[54:53.850 --> 54:55.430]  I'm going to put those right back in here.
[54:55.490 --> 54:56.290]  Those are awesome.
[54:58.290 --> 54:59.430]  Troy and Alicia.
[54:59.690 --> 55:00.670]  You guys are amazing.
[55:00.870 --> 55:02.190]  That was really sweet.
[55:03.110 --> 55:03.990]  So we'll put that there.
[55:04.950 --> 55:08.670]  We're not going to open up the whole thing, obviously, because we've got a bunch to get through.
[55:08.850 --> 55:10.170]  Including some expensive stuff I want to open.
[55:11.070 --> 55:13.090]  But we will open up some of these Tops Holiday.
[55:13.470 --> 55:14.990]  There should be an autograph in here.
[55:15.910 --> 55:17.790]  Or a mem card.
[55:18.550 --> 55:19.010]  Or a relic.
[55:19.130 --> 55:21.670]  The relic in these tends to be a Christmas sweater.
[55:22.570 --> 55:22.870]  What?
[55:22.870 --> 55:24.610]  Like a piece of a Christmas sweater that they wear.
[55:25.110 --> 55:27.230]  A piece of a Christmas sweater?
[55:27.430 --> 55:27.630]  Yeah.
[55:27.970 --> 55:31.910]  Oh, here we go.
[55:32.630 --> 55:32.810]  Hey.
[55:33.390 --> 55:34.070]  Henry needs his pill.
[55:34.910 --> 55:36.110]  Don't forget about Henry's pill.
[55:36.830 --> 55:37.510]  Here we go.
[55:38.730 --> 55:39.530]  Nolan Arenado's.
[55:42.010 --> 55:42.410]  Christmas...
[55:42.410 --> 55:43.730]  We'll put that on the tree next year.
[55:43.850 --> 55:46.130]  When we make the fuckface tree, we'll put it on there.
[55:46.410 --> 55:47.510]  What year are these from?
[55:47.850 --> 55:48.250]  2020.
[55:48.250 --> 55:50.030]  So we'll put these in the pack sack.
[55:50.070 --> 55:52.770]  Isn't Arenado a cardinal now?
[55:52.910 --> 55:54.190]  Didn't he leave the...
[55:54.190 --> 55:55.390]  Didn't the Rockies like run him out of town?
[55:55.870 --> 55:56.390]  I don't know.
[55:56.510 --> 55:59.410]  We're going to open some of these and save some.
[56:01.130 --> 56:02.430]  You put some in this pack sack?
[56:02.610 --> 56:03.370]  I put two in the pack sack.
[56:03.450 --> 56:03.990]  That's good.
[56:05.450 --> 56:07.650]  Has a player ever been literally run out of town?
[56:08.130 --> 56:09.890]  Oh, I'm sure it's baseball. I'm sure they have.
[56:10.030 --> 56:10.690]  Aaron Barrett.
[56:10.910 --> 56:14.710]  So the cool thing about these Christmas cards is they're the same as the regular cards design.
[56:15.030 --> 56:17.310]  But then they have these little snowflakes on them.
[56:17.310 --> 56:20.110]  And then the parallels, the snowflakes will be rigid.
[56:20.770 --> 56:22.290]  We'll probably give one, maybe.
[56:22.730 --> 56:23.050]  They're pretty rare.
[56:23.110 --> 56:23.710]  Manny Machado.
[56:24.550 --> 56:28.450]  And then some of the cards they will manipulate and put a little Christmas hat on them.
[56:28.510 --> 56:29.110]  Or something.
[56:29.390 --> 56:30.290]  I've never gotten one of those, though.
[56:30.890 --> 56:32.310]  But we did just get a...
[56:32.870 --> 56:34.090]  Some great first packs open.
[56:34.670 --> 56:36.350]  Here we go. Marcus Stroman.
[56:39.910 --> 56:40.790]  Patrick Corbin.
[56:42.490 --> 56:43.370]  Luis Arias.
[56:44.010 --> 56:45.230]  Luis Arias, but okay.
[56:45.230 --> 56:46.930]  Gavin Biggio.
[56:46.930 --> 56:47.970]  Is that Craig Biggio's son?
[56:48.190 --> 56:51.610]  It is! He's one of the many children of baseball players
[56:51.610 --> 56:53.470]  that are on the Blue Jays.
[56:54.050 --> 56:55.490]  Is that the whole thing?
[56:56.150 --> 56:58.370]  I'm glad Old Guerrero Jr. is there, too.
[56:58.490 --> 56:59.110]  Oh, that's a good point.
[56:59.930 --> 57:00.690]  The point I was making.
[57:01.190 --> 57:02.550]  Brewster Gatteral.
[57:03.690 --> 57:04.730]  Brewster Gatteral.
[57:05.090 --> 57:05.930]  Hate him.
[57:07.870 --> 57:08.910]  And then...
[57:09.730 --> 57:10.770]  Nick Senzel.
[57:11.630 --> 57:12.630]  Band-Aid.
[57:12.630 --> 57:13.810]  Ew! Is it a Band-Aid?
[57:13.810 --> 57:16.650]  This is a game-used memorabilia.
[57:16.690 --> 57:17.130]  It's a Band-Aid.
[57:17.710 --> 57:19.410]  It's from when it came off his hand.
[57:19.970 --> 57:20.570]  That's disgusting.
[57:20.930 --> 57:22.190]  It's a Band-Aid.
[57:22.230 --> 57:25.930]  It says you've received a relic card from the
[57:25.930 --> 57:28.590]  Topps 2020 Walmart Holiday Mega Baseball.
[57:28.910 --> 57:30.570]  The relic contained in this card is not from
[57:30.570 --> 57:32.330]  any specific game, event, or season.
[57:32.670 --> 57:35.070]  But it is from when he cut his finger.
[57:35.830 --> 57:36.410]  It's a Band-Aid.
[57:36.770 --> 57:37.610]  It is, I think, a Band-Aid.
[57:37.650 --> 57:38.750]  That's disgusting. Can I see it?
[57:38.750 --> 57:39.550]  Yeah, you want to touch the Band-Aid?
[57:39.770 --> 57:41.230]  You can open it and lick the Band-Aid.
[57:41.310 --> 57:43.230]  It can't be the actual Band-Aid.
[57:43.510 --> 57:45.810]  Was he Band-Aiding up for several games?
[57:47.270 --> 57:47.890]  What does it feel like?
[57:48.450 --> 57:51.130]  It does feel like a Band-Aid,
[57:51.250 --> 57:52.770]  but it could also feel like
[57:54.250 --> 57:54.970]  their pants.
[57:55.050 --> 57:55.930]  Like a jockstrap, maybe.
[57:56.190 --> 57:57.390]  Oh, maybe.
[57:58.450 --> 57:59.050]  It's a Band-Aid.
[57:59.290 --> 58:01.970]  I feel like that's a biohazard.
[58:02.050 --> 58:03.270]  There's no way it's not a Band-Aid.
[58:03.570 --> 58:04.930]  I don't know what else it would be.
[58:04.930 --> 58:07.350]  I mean, that's good. That's perfect, but...
[58:07.350 --> 58:08.430]  What a weird card.
[58:09.550 --> 58:10.470]  Band-Aid. Awesome.
[58:11.570 --> 58:12.370]  I don't know.
[58:12.650 --> 58:14.370]  Well, next time you need a cut, you're out of Band-Aids. You got one.
[58:14.670 --> 58:15.770]  Let's open a couple more of these.
[58:16.190 --> 58:17.890]  Let's see if we get one of the parallels.
[58:19.010 --> 58:19.710]  With a hat?
[58:20.890 --> 58:22.950]  Yeah, or one of the rigid things.
[58:23.030 --> 58:24.150]  We got a...
[58:25.550 --> 58:25.870]  whoever.
[58:28.610 --> 58:29.250]  Kevin Kirmire.
[58:30.050 --> 58:30.490]  Austin Riley.
[58:30.490 --> 58:32.410]  Does anyone want these?
[58:32.410 --> 58:33.030]  What do you mean?
[58:33.390 --> 58:34.710]  In the sense of like...
[58:34.710 --> 58:37.570]  Is anyone excited about snowflakes?
[58:38.130 --> 58:40.170]  Andrew, I agree with you.
[58:40.310 --> 58:41.450]  These cards, look.
[58:41.590 --> 58:43.430]  We're opening them. They were cool to send in.
[58:44.310 --> 58:45.370]  They're great cards.
[58:46.270 --> 58:47.130]  Oh, I have...
[58:47.130 --> 58:50.050]  I have a Marcus Smart for everyone.
[58:50.430 --> 58:51.910]  But that's what I'm saying.
[58:52.070 --> 58:52.990]  That's who it's for.
[58:53.150 --> 58:54.170]  These cards suck.
[58:54.970 --> 58:57.670]  They're fine baseball cards, but look at...
[58:57.670 --> 58:59.630]  They just put little snowflakes on them like anyone gives a shit.
[58:59.630 --> 59:01.830]  This is one of those parallels I was talking about.
[59:01.930 --> 59:02.910]  Where the snowflakes are rigid.
[59:03.050 --> 59:06.030]  You can't really see it, but you can feel the difference between the cards.
[59:06.590 --> 59:07.570]  Geoff got very excited
[59:07.570 --> 59:10.090]  when we were at a Giddings Walmart and found these.
[59:11.350 --> 59:12.230]  Eloy Jimenez.
[59:13.210 --> 59:14.590]  Rookie Cup card. That's cool.
[59:15.470 --> 59:16.110]  Brandon Lowe.
[59:17.850 --> 59:18.730]  Matt Chapman.
[59:20.070 --> 59:20.650]  So there you go.
[59:22.830 --> 59:23.270]  Then...
[59:23.270 --> 59:24.330]  Oh, Wilson Contreras.
[59:25.910 --> 59:27.210]  Oh, check it out.
[59:28.810 --> 59:29.610]  Malik Smith.
[59:29.670 --> 59:31.210]  I'm not familiar with him, but he is...
[59:32.150 --> 59:33.310]  I'm not sure what he's doing there.
[59:33.570 --> 59:34.570]  Taking his glove off, I guess?
[59:34.990 --> 59:35.970]  He's doing it suggestively.
[59:38.090 --> 59:39.070]  We've got another half hour.
[59:39.290 --> 59:40.670]  We've got time.
[59:41.190 --> 59:42.970]  I wouldn't mind opening some more of this mail shit.
[59:43.190 --> 59:43.350]  Oh.
[59:44.990 --> 59:45.670]  Oh no.
[59:47.970 --> 59:49.630]  Here's Ryan McBroom.
[59:49.870 --> 59:50.810]  Rookie. Never heard of him.
[59:52.150 --> 59:52.950]  Alex Young.
[59:53.350 --> 59:53.630]  Rookie.
[59:55.190 --> 59:55.710]  Oh.
[59:56.390 --> 59:57.190]  Lou Bob.
[59:58.350 --> 59:59.390]  Luis Robert.
[59:59.570 --> 01:00:00.030]  Oh.
[01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:02.710]  AJ Realmoto.
[01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:04.970]  Oh.
[01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:06.810]  It says JT, but you're fine.
[01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:08.890]  Are you a stepper when you swing a bat?
[01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:10.490]  What was that?
[01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:13.270]  What's your bat swing form like? Do you step?
[01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:15.130]  I'm not a stepper when I swing.
[01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:16.030]  You step?
[01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:17.630]  Santa.
[01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:21.270]  Why is Santa there?
[01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:22.030]  Oh my God.
[01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.150]  You didn't even see it.
[01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:28.270]  This is one of those parallels I was talking about.
[01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.410]  Where they fucking sneak Santa Christmas shit.
[01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.570]  Yeah.
[01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:32.530]  It wasn't really there.
[01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:34.250]  He wasn't really there.
[01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:36.470]  He wasn't really there?
[01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:37.590]  They added that later?
[01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.250]  Uh.
[01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:44.070]  I'm on the lookout for Santa again.
[01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.970]  Whoa.
[01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:46.130]  Look at that stride.
[01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.910]  Wow.
[01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:47.170]  Wow.
[01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:49.370]  Lizardo rookie.
[01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:51.870]  And Bryce Harper.
[01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:53.510]  Damn, dude.
[01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:55.670]  I've never gotten one of those. That's cool.
[01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.590]  Oh.
[01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:00.870]  This is the best.
[01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:02.230]  Another Christmas one?
[01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:04.050]  He got so excited.
[01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:05.810]  Boba Shett.
[01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:06.870]  There you go. Rookie card.
[01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:11.130]  I think I'm realizing I'm against snowflakes.
[01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:13.270]  Santa in the background.
[01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:14.930]  I thought it was a Christmas card.
[01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:15.810]  I'm with you.
[01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:18.490]  100%.
[01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:20.190]  Jorge Soler.
[01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:22.050]  Matt Olsen.
[01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:25.570]  If one of those guys was Santa Claus,
[01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:26.330]  way into it.
[01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:27.250]  It's just snowflakes.
[01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:29.530]  If every card had a hidden Santa.
[01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:31.690]  I love it.
[01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:34.450]  George Springer giving you a double thumbs up.
[01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:38.250]  Steven Strasburg.
[01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:39.610]  He went to my high school.
[01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:41.010]  Did you know him?
[01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.450]  No, he's younger than I am.
[01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:43.250]  Mike Clevenger.
[01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:46.870]  Sunshine. Mike Clevenger.
[01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:48.610]  I actually follow him on Instagram.
[01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:50.490]  He's an endless source of positivity.
[01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:52.690]  Let's open something from the pack sack.
[01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:56.670]  Keep your little...
[01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:57.170]  We'll get there.
[01:01:58.550 --> 01:01:59.790]  Here we go.
[01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:02.390]  Some 1991 Topps football.
[01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:03.130]  Oh yeah.
[01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:06.670]  Thousand yard club.
[01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.970]  It's from war.
[01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:10.750]  You know.
[01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:17.070]  In an upcoming episode of Fuckface
[01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:20.470]  there's a discussion about thousand yard stairs.
[01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:20.770]  Yep.
[01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:22.490]  Out of nowhere.
[01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:25.290]  Fucking boom.
[01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:27.310]  Barry Sanders.
[01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:29.770]  People might disagree with me,
[01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.170]  but I think maybe the best running back of all time.
[01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:32.810]  I don't know if he's the best.
[01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:34.830]  Here's why.
[01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:36.990]  He retired early.
[01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:39.050]  If he would have played longer,
[01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:40.170]  if he would have played Emmitt Smith years,
[01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:40.930]  it would have been a different story.
[01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.290]  But he was like, I'm going to save my body.
[01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:44.230]  I think that's most running backs.
[01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:47.490]  It's the most Detroit Lions players.
[01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:49.250]  Calvin Johnson following later.
[01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:52.150]  Steve Jordan. Kevin Fagan.
[01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:53.270]  Terry McDaniel.
[01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:55.150]  John Williams.
[01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:57.890]  Can we go back to one card for a second?
[01:02:58.210 --> 01:02:59.710]  What is going on there?
[01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:01.730]  Is he trying to block a kick?
[01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:03.190]  What is the goal?
[01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:04.390]  Who has the ball?
[01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:06.330]  He's running to try to catch it.
[01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:08.170]  I don't know.
[01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:10.930]  Terry McDaniel is a cornerback.
[01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:12.490]  Is this what they call a football move?
[01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:14.130]  Yeah.
[01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:16.490]  I feel like he lost the play.
[01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:17.850]  He seems really out of position.
[01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:20.110]  Look at that old Seahawks logo.
[01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:20.930]  It's pretty cool.
[01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:22.930]  These are weird.
[01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:26.390]  Tim Rosenbach.
[01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:28.350]  Two M's.
[01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:29.170]  Oh shit.
[01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:30.910]  Fuckin' Randall Cunningham.
[01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:35.510]  Randall Cunningham is the reason I stopped doing fantasy football.
[01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:36.510]  Oh really?
[01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:40.350]  I picked him one year and he fucked me so hard.
[01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:42.930]  What year were you playing fantasy football?
[01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.670]  I don't know.
[01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:45.170]  Must have been...
[01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:46.770]  90's?
[01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:48.650]  So were there even computers for that?
[01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:51.350]  Fantasy football was happening in the 90's?
[01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:52.190]  I think so, yeah.
[01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:53.570]  Like on dial-up?
[01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:55.490]  Yeah. Like on Yahoo.
[01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:56.530]  I used to do it on Yahoo.
[01:03:56.790 --> 01:03:57.290]  Really?
[01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:59.510]  I had no idea.
[01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:01.050]  I was in the army still, I think.
[01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:04.430]  You'd hear old school stories of fantasy football.
[01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:07.830]  Of guys waiting for papers in cities they didn't live in.
[01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:09.030]  Bruce Smith.
[01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:11.490]  Michael Stewart.
[01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:13.690]  Stanley Richard.
[01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:17.330]  Tim Crumry.
[01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:18.250]  69.
[01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:19.650]  He's just hanging out.
[01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:21.970]  I'm about to show you hanging out.
[01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:23.970]  Sean Lee.
[01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:25.290]  Hell yeah!
[01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.790]  Oh, he's chilling.
[01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:28.710]  I give a fuck.
[01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:31.550]  Oh, cool.
[01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:34.230]  Akoye powers ahead. This is a Christian Akoye card.
[01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:36.470]  I was a huge Christian Akoye fan when I was a kid.
[01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:37.370]  Played for the Chiefs.
[01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:38.530]  James Brooks.
[01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:42.010]  And super rookie, Tori Epps.
[01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.370]  Nice.
[01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:44.690]  It looks like a yearbook photo to me.
[01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:45.190]  It does.
[01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.670]  Cutie.
[01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:49.310]  All right, there we go.
[01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:50.850]  What should we open up next?
[01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:51.790]  What is this?
[01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:55.190]  This is from...
[01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:56.590]  I don't want to show addresses.
[01:04:58.330 --> 01:04:59.670]  Careful not to do that.
[01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:10.890]  Got it.
[01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:12.070]  Don't you have a box cutter right there?
[01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:13.570]  Yeah, but this is funnier.
[01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:17.550]  Until he slices his stomach open.
[01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:18.810]  We have a band-aid!
[01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:20.050]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:25.030]  Oh, these are awesome.
[01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:26.230]  Holy shit.
[01:05:26.330 --> 01:05:26.930]  What is it?
[01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:30.650]  Will sent us a lot of stuff.
[01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:31.250]  We'll get to these.
[01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:34.350]  NKOTB, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast.
[01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:35.250]  We have so much.
[01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:37.990]  T2, Hunger Games. I've never seen those.
[01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:39.950]  Hunchback of Notre Dame, definitely.
[01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.170]  Actual Notre Dame.
[01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:44.030]  The Hunchback and the University.
[01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:46.910]  Star Trek Next Generation, Pocahontas.
[01:05:48.330 --> 01:05:49.050]  Anastasia, Pocahontas.
[01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:51.130]  What else do we have?
[01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:53.550]  Wanted to add some cards to the special collection.
[01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:55.170]  Some great baseball names in here.
[01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:56.030]  Oh, that's great.
[01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:58.490]  Bill and Ted's.
[01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:00.290]  Oh, Twilight and Breaking Dawn.
[01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:01.030]  We'll save those.
[01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:06.550]  Dear Geoff, hello, my name is Will.
[01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:07.550]  And I've been watching Achievement Hunter.
[01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:09.370]  A little package of cards.
[01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:11.750]  A small thank you, specifically to Geoff, that's me, not you.
[01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:15.010]  If you ever want to chat about cards, I'd love to.
[01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:17.570]  Thank you, Will.
[01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:19.090]  Thanks, Big Bill.
[01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:20.610]  Appreciate it.
[01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:23.610]  Let's crack into this and see what you got us.
[01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:26.630]  I want to break into these Hunger Games immediately.
[01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:29.510]  I want a Natalie Dormer with a shaved head.
[01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:30.010]  Whoa.
[01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:33.030]  I want a Hoffman. That'd be my dream.
[01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:34.930]  CG Hoffman, specifically.
[01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:36.390]  Oh, we got that dude.
[01:06:37.330 --> 01:06:37.850]  Oh!
[01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:39.370]  Nice.
[01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:42.030]  President Snow.
[01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:44.030]  Donald Sutherland.
[01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:46.190]  Here we go.
[01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:50.250]  Wasn't there weird
[01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:52.430]  Donald Sutherland trivia last episode?
[01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:53.230]  There was the
[01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:54.750]  Kiefer Sutherland's full name.
[01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:57.610]  Oh yeah, Kiefer Sutherland's full name.
[01:06:57.950 --> 01:07:00.270]  This appears to be, what is the actress's name?
[01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:01.490]  Jennifer Lawrence.
[01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:04.150]  But it's the Girl Scout one.
[01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:06.670]  This is the Hunger Games thing.
[01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:07.410]  I'm hungry.
[01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:09.070]  That's what she says.
[01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:10.970]  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:13.110]  So fucking eager to open these cards.
[01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:15.470]  I'm like, doesn't know shit about it.
[01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:16.530]  I saw the
[01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:18.670]  second movie, I think.
[01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:20.250]  You saw the second?
[01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:22.570]  That's a good card.
[01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:25.510]  Hey Mitch Abernathy.
[01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:26.670]  He's happy about that hair.
[01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:29.150]  It looks like Woody Harrelson
[01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:31.630]  named his own character and picked his own look.
[01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:31.870]  Yeah.
[01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:33.110]  I love it.
[01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:35.350]  He's really smug.
[01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:37.530]  Yeah, and I got like long
[01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:38.610]  cool hair.
[01:07:39.530 --> 01:07:41.090]  He looks like a turd.
[01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:42.190]  Oh, here we go.
[01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:44.730]  Is this Stanley Tucci?
[01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:46.810]  Oh, the Rhino!
[01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:47.790]  Stanley Tucci.
[01:07:48.050 --> 01:07:48.450]  The Tooch.
[01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:51.190]  We'll save that too.
[01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:55.350]  Oh, you know what we should...
[01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:56.650]  I want to talk.
[01:07:56.790 --> 01:07:57.730]  I should show something off.
[01:07:58.330 --> 01:07:59.270]  Before we go any further.
[01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:01.630]  If you follow the podcast,
[01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:02.990]  you know that
[01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:04.950]  we invent products.
[01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:07.870]  Uniform is a parent
[01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:09.610]  company of a parent company.
[01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.650]  And
[01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:12.730]  it...
[01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:15.190]  We invent useful products.
[01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:16.830]  One of those products that we have invented
[01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:20.050]  that I'm very excited to share with you, we've talked about it but we've never been able to show it,
[01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:21.150]  is the official
[01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.910]  Uniform...
[01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:23.650]  Flip it around.
[01:08:25.530 --> 01:08:27.830]  The official Uniform...
[01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:29.070]  Uh...
[01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:29.370]  No!
[01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:32.370]  What's happening?
[01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:34.310]  Wrist pocket. I have no idea what's going on.
[01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:35.590]  He doesn't want the wrist pocket to come out.
[01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:37.990]  There it is.
[01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:40.630]  The official Uniform wrist pocket.
[01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:43.090]  Can we get a nice close-up
[01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:44.830]  on how the wrist pocket works?
[01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:48.630]  Just so you know, that's it.
[01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:50.650]  Yeah. Works great.
[01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:52.530]  Keep your stuff. Here's what's great.
[01:08:52.570 --> 01:08:53.730]  You want to put something in your wrist pocket?
[01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:56.690]  Check it out. Boom. Bill and Ted's
[01:08:56.690 --> 01:08:58.870]  goes in. Snap it
[01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:59.590]  for safety.
[01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:02.590]  And then show me what happens.
[01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:03.470]  It's not falling out now.
[01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:06.750]  You're going to steal this from me? How?
[01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:08.730]  It's in front of me. I maintain positive eye
[01:09:08.730 --> 01:09:10.010]  control on it at all times.
[01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:12.510]  It is impossible for you to pick this pocket.
[01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:14.990]  This is the most secure pocket
[01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:16.650]  on your body. Now no one will steal
[01:09:16.650 --> 01:09:17.890]  your Bill and Ted cards.
[01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:20.890]  Or whatever you want to put there. Put it in your fucking fancy watch.
[01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:22.690]  Or a billion dollars. It won't matter because
[01:09:22.690 --> 01:09:24.670]  nobody can get it without cutting your wrist off.
[01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:26.670]  Why would you put your watch...
[01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:28.150]  I saw a watch. I have a watch on.
[01:09:29.190 --> 01:09:30.370]  I said what I saw.
[01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:34.510]  No object permanence.
[01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:35.810]  I just saw it and I said it.
[01:09:36.790 --> 01:09:38.250]  So how many of these do we have?
[01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:40.250]  We have 350 of them. Oh, really?
[01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:41.910]  How do you know that number so specifically?
[01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:43.610]  They got mailed to me. Why is that?
[01:09:44.490 --> 01:09:45.610]  So here's what I want to get.
[01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:48.250]  I don't remember...
[01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.590]  I do remember how it happened. Andrew and
[01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:52.610]  Eric fucked me in a merch
[01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:54.890]  meeting. I don't understand how this keeps...
[01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:56.430]  And they came up with the idea that I would have to sign
[01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:58.170]  or personalize every one of these.
[01:09:58.310 --> 01:10:00.150]  And I got them and I was thinking about it.
[01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:01.730]  And I'm going to pose this to you audience.
[01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:03.590]  And see what you think about it.
[01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:06.190]  I feel like if I were to
[01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:08.230]  mark them in some way, it would take away
[01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:10.010]  from the subtle beauty of the card.
[01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:12.030]  And if it got wet, it might smear.
[01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:13.890]  I don't want to just like sharpie them up.
[01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:16.730]  So I came up with this idea. And let me see how you feel about this.
[01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:18.570]  I had...
[01:10:18.570 --> 01:10:20.250]  Because it holds cards perfectly, right?
[01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:22.090]  I had...
[01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:23.950]  Just want you to know, these are the lengths he's going to
[01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:25.850]  to not do the thing that he said he was going to do.
[01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:27.130]  Well, I'm going to do something better.
[01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:30.650]  What if instead of signing each one of these, I sign something else?
[01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:32.170]  What if I signed a card?
[01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:33.910]  And I put the card in it.
[01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:36.090]  But not just any card. Not just signed it.
[01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:38.510]  What if I took like, say, a Hunger Games
[01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:39.450]  card of
[01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:42.550]  Seneca Crane.
[01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:46.730]  Just as an example.
[01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:48.250]  And what if I got...
[01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:49.910]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:52.210]  An official fuckface
[01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:53.270]  embosser made.
[01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:56.250]  And I emboss...
[01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:59.050]  Let's see how this works.
[01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:02.570]  Oh, that's nice.
[01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:04.330]  So again, instead of
[01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:06.050]  signing it with a sharpie, he decided he
[01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:07.910]  wanted embossers made.
[01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:10.870]  So he can emboss these cards.
[01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:12.450]  Now it's a one-of-a-kind fuckface card.
[01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:14.330]  And then I can number
[01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:16.350]  it as well. And then what I'll do
[01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:18.230]  is I'll
[01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:20.330]  pull 350 cards from
[01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:22.510]  out of the break show. I'll emboss
[01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:23.750]  it, number it,
[01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:25.130]  sleeve it,
[01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:28.010]  and include one free
[01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:29.890]  in every
[01:11:29.890 --> 01:11:32.190]  wrist pocket. So here's the thing. I think it's a great idea.
[01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:34.390]  I think somehow you're mad at me
[01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:36.130]  and Andrew for something you agreed to
[01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:37.750]  and then through
[01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:40.470]  figuring out this other way of doing things
[01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:42.010]  have created more work for yourself.
[01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:44.330]  It's going to be more work for myself, but it's
[01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:45.830]  going to create a better product.
[01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:48.010]  I don't want to ruin
[01:11:48.010 --> 01:11:49.510]  the wrist pocket
[01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:51.850]  by marring it with my
[01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:53.230]  terrible handwriting.
[01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:55.910]  It's going to be out in the elements. I don't know if
[01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:58.250]  the marker would run over time.
[01:11:58.650 --> 01:12:00.310]  So instead, what you're getting is you're getting
[01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:02.010]  an unmarred, unblemished
[01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:04.570]  wrist pocket, and inside
[01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:06.450]  is going to be a personalized
[01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:07.790]  card from
[01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:09.310]  fuckface break shit.
[01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:12.330]  Also, I don't just have...
[01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:14.270]  This is even more exciting. I don't just
[01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:15.830]  have... Here, I'll do the Zig Highland.
[01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:18.470]  I don't just have fuckface,
[01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:20.230]  I also have... You're going to
[01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:20.850]  love this.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.080]  Uniform!
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:27.680]  I've also got the uniform.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:28.600]  The power of one?
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.300]  She's saying she's combining fabric
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:34.040]  of the farm with the power of one. Uniform.
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:35.800]  You can see she's doing it right there.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:37.160]  Boom.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:39.300]  Thanks, Mike.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.180]  He's just doing it
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:44.060]  for us. He's doing
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.180]  our uniform salute.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:48.460]  We're not
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:50.040]  going to do that. Don't do that.
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:51.880]  It's not an official salute.
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:54.120]  So if the audience is
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.640]  accepting of it...
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.160]  I think it's a great idea.
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.200]  I think it's really cool. I think it's
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.220]  crazy that you're doing more work and still mad at me and Andrew
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.120]  for not doing anything to get
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.840]  you to do this to begin with. It doesn't matter.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.120]  I think you should thank us, honestly.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.980]  Because this is a cooler idea,
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:11.600]  I think, than you just writing
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.780]  Risk Pockets Rock on them. I agree.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:15.260]  And you wouldn't have got here without us.
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.160]  I agree. It's cooler because I came up with it.
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.900]  Yeah, but you came up with it because you're blaming us
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:21.940]  for making you do another thing, which you agreed to.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:23.780]  But let's just go with your narrative that we forced you.
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.180]  But I never agreed to it. That's the thing.
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:26.680]  You absolutely did.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.120]  Well, I'm not going to do it all on camera, but every card
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.780]  that shows up in...
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:33.820]  If you buy... I don't even know when they go on sale.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.780]  Do you? No, because you have to do all this.
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:37.660]  Oh. It's waiting on me.
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:39.380]  Alright, so here's what's going to happen.
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.220]  I'm going to create
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.620]  350 one-of-a-kind
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:45.480]  numbered, fuck-face
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.700]  uniform cards. Maybe I'll do 175 and 175
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.700]  of each. Then I'll insert each one
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.720]  in, and then I'll put them back in
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.720]  the thing, and then when you
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.740]  buy one, you'll get a card that
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:57.540]  appeared on this show
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.720]  at some point. Now again, Geoff
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.900]  is saying that he doesn't want to sign the outside of these pockets
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:03.720]  because they're going to be used in the
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.660]  elements. If you use these
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:07.440]  just, not even in the elements, just
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.700]  whenever. Can you take a picture? Because I
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:11.320]  got to see what kind of little freak you are
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:14.000]  using a wrist pocket out in public.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:15.180]  A stylish freak.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:17.800]  I'm going out
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.540]  with friends. Let's do
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.660]  Bill and Ted's most atypical
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:23.840]  movie cards. Okay. A bodacious
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.580]  trip to San Dimas, California
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:27.680]  or some other non-prize you can win.
[01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.700]  That's cool. San Dimas High School Football Rules.
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:32.100]  Uh...
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.600]  So these are the second
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.600]  movie? So here's a card.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.300]  This is the second movie, isn't it?
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.580]  Yeah, this is Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey. Here's another card.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:41.560]  Here's Alex Winter
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.800]  and Keanu Reeves
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.600]  not studying. There's no
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.340]  way. Now, if there were
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.780]  snowflakes on this card.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.140]  Yeah. Oh, here's
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:51.920]  Billy the Kid.
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:53.820]  Oh, here's
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.920]  Alex Winter and some presidents.
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.860]  That's from the Excellent Adventure.
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.060]  Here's Bogus Journey again.
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.220]  When I see Alex Winter, all I can think about
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:04.980]  is the Lost Boys now. I don't know why. Oh, really?
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.600]  That's what pops in my head. Not Bill and Ted.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.980]  There's King Dipshit and the Ladies.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:10.640]  Uh...
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.600]  There's Moses and a Cowboy.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.120]  Here's the Long Arm of the
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.260]  Law. Talking to Abraham Lincoln.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.060]  Oh, and then
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:20.520]  the girls are tied up. Oh, no!
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.320]  Waiting for the bad dudes to save them, I guess.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.560]  And then here's your... Pro set, baby.
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.020]  Okay, so there's what the... That's some Bill
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:28.700]  and Ted's. They really put a lot into that.
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:31.000]  Okay, let's
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:32.340]  try...
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.840]  Let's try the American Gladiators.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.780]  Oh, cool! Eight glossy cards in one
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:38.520]  sticker. You know, my middle name
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.020]  is Laser because of American Gladiators.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:42.760]  That's pretty cool. Yeah, I named myself
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.840]  because of the American Gladiators. Oh, fuck.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.880]  Here we go. I always loved, when I was a
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.860]  kid, when they would build puzzles, you could make a puzzle
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:49.720]  and get a puzzle card.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.940]  Here we have Host and the Gladiators.
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:54.860]  I thought it said Hosing. Hosing, yeah.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:57.020]  Larry
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.260]  Zonka and Mike
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.380]  Oh, Larry Zonka! Alright.
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.800]  Larry Zonka's on the right there. Here we go.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.880]  Aiming for the bullseye. Nice.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.580]  Oh, it's like a...
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:07.160]  anal gun.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.920]  He who laughs last.
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.200]  Oh my god.
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.600]  Back to back.
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.600]  I like the titling on these cards. Zapped.
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.860]  Here we go. A giant step
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:23.060]  for mankind. That's a lot of hair.
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:23.740]  That's pretty cool.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.760]  Thunder, giving chase.
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:28.960]  And Nitro's deadly grip. Damn.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:30.400]  Those are cool. Those are real cool.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:31.420]  Those are cool cards. Thank you.
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:34.200]  If you buy a wrist pocket, you're going to get one of those.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.300]  And then we have
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:39.280]  Hunchback of Notre Dame and the University of Notre Dame.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.520]  Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to open them both.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.200]  I'm going to mix them together.
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.280]  Which one's which?
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:48.780]  Do you think Rudy will be in
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.720]  the Notre Dame? I hope so.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.620]  Oh boy, that would be cool.
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:54.200]  The real Rudy or Sean Astin?
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.100]  That's the only Rudy.
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.740]  This is the first edition of cards.
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:01.820]  How many did they make?
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.800]  Are they still making cards? You have Google.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:06.700]  Fair.
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:09.720]  Alright.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:11.660]  Good point.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.520]  It might be the only one because I just see Notre Dame
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.640]  cards first edition and it's just these.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:17.860]  Here we go.
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:19.440]  Yeah, it appears to just be these.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.600]  Gypsy Spirit.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.520]  Esmeralda, right? That's from the school.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:24.220]  Okay.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.740]  That's from the school. That's Rudy.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.500]  That's Rudy? But Sean Astin.
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:30.100]  Sean Astin.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:37.660]  That was him at the end
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:39.440]  when they lifted him up on their shoulders.
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.820]  It's time for, he said, second breakfast.
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:43.820]  I never saw this movie or attended
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:44.680]  this school. Teammates?
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.400]  This, I believe, is from the movie.
[01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:47.260]  Monty Stickles.
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:50.460]  Ted Gradle. Oh, here we go.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.440]  Frank Norty Hoffman.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.820]  Look at that fucking winner.
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.240]  Joe Montana.
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.380]  Know him. It's gotta be a hit.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.220]  1973 Sugar Bowl.
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:05.280]  1976 Gator Bowl.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:06.040]  That's cool.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:08.600]  1990 Orange Bowl.
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:11.620]  Steve Nyhouse.
[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.360]  What's your favorite bowl?
[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:15.220]  Cereal.
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:17.500]  It's a good bowl. Ice cream.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.500]  I like the Fiesta Bowl.
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.560]  Totino's Fiesta Bowl. I like Captain Crunch.
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.480]  It's another PlayStation one, sadly.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.480]  Bullshit. Here we have
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.480]  this. It's a puzzle
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.360]  piece.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.380]  It's a two-piece puzzle. I like him.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.500]  Daddy. This is easy to put together, I bet.
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:34.280]  That's my favorite character.
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:36.500]  That is a two-piece puzzle.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:39.440]  Jester's challenge
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:39.940]  Bullshit.
[01:18:41.170 --> 01:18:43.280]  I'm a card like a coin
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:44.480]  using your thumb.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.840]  You get the game.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:48.460]  Quasimodo.
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:50.700]  Are these not cards? These are like toys?
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:52.380]  These are like punch-outs.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.140]  Here's coin cards.
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:56.660]  For your Jester games.
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:58.060]  I hate this.
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:00.120]  I don't like these cards.
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:01.720]  These cards suck.
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:04.120]  Boom.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:04.820]  Oh.
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:08.540]  What's next?
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:10.200]  This was sent in by
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.140]  someone.
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:14.960]  Chris Cha.
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:16.440]  Chris sent in
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.040]  the Venus swimwear
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.960]  international model search.
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:21.800]  Oh boy.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:24.640]  We'll open up
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:25.460]  a pack of these.
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:28.240]  It's 2022
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.340]  for Christ's sake.
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.240]  What year is this from?
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:32.280]  I don't know.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.360]  There's 36 packs.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.260]  That's too many.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.060]  We're looking for an auto.
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:41.320]  We're on card auto.
[01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:42.080]  Looking for the band-aid card.
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.120]  From a star model search
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.240]  Venus swimwear international model search.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.260]  Win stuff.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:50.780]  I love to win stuff.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:51.920]  Like a bathing suit catalog.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.100]  I'm excited to win stuff.
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:56.280]  These might be resealed packs.
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.720]  They're sticky too.
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:19:59.760]  Ew.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.280]  Put it up next to your microphone.
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.120]  Here we have Michelle
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:07.940]  Armstrong.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.000]  Hi there.
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:12.280]  From 94 by the way.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.560]  This is some late 80s, early 90s.
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:15.000]  Here we go.
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.320]  There's Jill Bartell.
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:21.240]  Uh oh.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.320]  They're also sticky.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.480]  I wonder what these people are up to now.
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:31.760]  I'm having trouble reading this font.
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:32.860]  Really?
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.720]  You're having trouble in sticking these cards.
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:37.740]  It's hard to read the font when I'm looking at the boobs.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:39.520]  Keelan...
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:41.440]  Cummuck.
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:42.880]  What the fuck?
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.440]  Karen Rye.
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.600]  Casey Gray.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.060]  I don't know if the audience can hear it.
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:55.320]  The Michael Jones recording
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.800]  something in the background in some room.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:59.360]  Here's Denise Piero.
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:00.140]  Uh huh.
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:04.900]  Hannah McElroy.
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:05.880]  Oh boy.
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.420]  And Krista McGee.
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:09.500]  There you go.
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:12.380]  She's a McGee-ski.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.040]  Thank you for these.
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:14.860]  Thank you.
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.620]  Eric, let me ask you a question.
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:21.780]  Would you rather open up AEW or NXT cards?
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:22.780]  Look at the prices.
[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:23.900]  AEW.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.440]  It's so cute.
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:31.640]  What are they recording?
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.160]  I don't know, but it's going to come out soon.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.280]  It's pretty exciting.
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:36.640]  Whatever it is, it's going to come out loud.
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.340]  These AEW cards are like brand new.
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:40.740]  He's like brand new.
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.240]  I bought these at the baseball card shop.
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:44.200]  Brody Lee.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.240]  Rest in peace, Brody Lee.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:48.320]  Yeah, he passed
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.760]  late 2020.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.500]  He got signed.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.220]  I mean, he's a great pro wrestler.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:55.980]  And then just
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.360]  had something.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.700]  I don't think they've come out and said, but
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:21:59.900]  failure of lungs.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.020]  He passed.
[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:03.740]  He's the fucking man.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:05.340]  I was a big fan of that guy from 2010.
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:06.880]  Do you know Evil Uno?
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.500]  Evil Uno streams on Twitch, but he's
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.360]  the member of the cult that Brody Lee
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.020]  was the master of.
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:16.080]  So the wrestling groups are called cults.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:17.300]  Oh my lord.
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:18.960]  He had a cult.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.320]  This is creepy.
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:23.940]  Not this one, this is Tully Blanchard.
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.480]  Four Horsemen.
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:27.740]  That's Tully Blanchard.
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.400]  He got old.
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:31.040]  That's typically what happens.
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:33.660]  What do you think?
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:35.060]  That's Tully Blanchard.
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:37.860]  Arne Anderson's in AEW also.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:38.260]  Really?
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:42.100]  Tully Blanchard is one of the best.
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:43.340]  Explain this.
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.580]  Abaddon is awesome.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:48.160]  Abaddon is a freaky little wrestler.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.220]  Spits blood and she's the living
[01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:50.800]  dead girl.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.520]  AEW is coming back in March.
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:56.080]  Here's Nyla Rose.
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:57.560]  Nyla Rose is
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.640]  I think one of the better wrestlers in the
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.840]  women's division. She's awesome.
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:04.020]  The native beast.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.440]  Here we go.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.560]  The Bastard Pack.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.480]  He's awesome. He's shredded.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.460]  He looks like that legitimately
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:12.520]  all the time.
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:15.440]  Here we go. Sting.
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:17.200]  Didn't know he was still around.
[01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.660]  Sting walks softly and carries a big
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.300]  stick in AEW debut.
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:22.960]  Thanks Stinger. Steve Borden.
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:24.840]  Sean Spears.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.060]  The chair man. He has a chair.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:27.880]  He hits people with a chair.
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:31.660]  Let's try NXT now.
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:32.340]  Let's do it.
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:34.560]  Are we supposed to stop soon?
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:36.260]  We have until 5.
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:37.980]  I still want to open those
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:40.180]  Flux cards. We do that next
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:41.220]  and we can go out on top.
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:43.540]  By the way,
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.800]  if you send us mail and we didn't get to it,
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:46.700]  we will in the future.
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:49.660]  We're going to do these more regularly.
[01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:52.080]  I would like to get these much more regularly
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:52.640]  than once a month.
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.400]  Here we go. The Way. That is Johnny Gargano
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.980]  and Austin Theory. They defeated
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:00.180]  Kushida and Leon Ruff in a tag match.
[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:02.200]  Johnny Gargano is the
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.500]  North American champion in that.
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.600]  I don't know what's going on right here,
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:07.120]  but it's fucking hilarious.
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.460]  Oh, Marcel Barthel
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:10.200]  is...
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:13.620]  He's got Matt Lee
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:14.760]  who's an AEW now.
[01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:17.960]  It's like an arm lock.
[01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.080]  It's a rest hold.
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.300]  They're working down to get the crowd back into it.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.380]  He's tickling him?
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:23.820]  That's a good tickle move.
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:27.560]  That looks like Erika Jayne.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.220]  Absolutely.
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:31.220]  Tom Girardi's ex-wife.
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:32.900]  Yeah, it's expensive to be me.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.360]  Scarlett Bordeaux.
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:37.180]  No longer in WWE.
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:38.900]  See, that's a joke Andrew would get
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:41.300]  if his fake ass would watch Real Housewives instead of talking about it.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:42.700]  I'm watching it.
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:44.280]  Are you watching Beverly Hills or Salt Lake?
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.640]  How many episodes of Salt Lake are you in?
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.660]  One and a half.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.720]  You ain't watching shit.
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:52.740]  I'm making progress.
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:54.900]  He is an AEW now.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.300]  He wears little panties.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.900]  There's a little E next to his little P.
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:01.320]  Here's Finn Balor.
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:02.300]  Finn Balor.
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:06.180]  Now, what do they call their little panties?
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:06.660]  Trunks.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.700]  Trunks I thought were shorts.
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:09.820]  That's Trunks, it's gear.
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.140]  Is he back in NXT?
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.860]  He was for a while.
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:18.440]  It says Isaiah Swerve Scott, but I don't think that's Isaiah.
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:20.220]  That's El Tijo Fantasma.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.860]  Let me see that card.
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:25.780]  That is not...
[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:26.740]  Oh, maybe it is.
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:28.240]  I don't remember his hair like that.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.540]  Do you guys remember that time the Brozerweights
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:32.240]  maintained the championship?
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:34.360]  Yes.
[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:36.500]  Matt Riddle was the guy who was on that UFC
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:37.300]  fighter show.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.300]  He was in UFC and won a bunch of fights,
[01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:42.080]  but wouldn't stop smoking weed, so they had to fire him.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:43.380]  He was in both.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:46.600]  He's an RK bro now, right?
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:48.640]  Yeah, he's on a tag team with Randy Orton
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:49.000]  on Raw.
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:52.360]  Some people wear the masks like the
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:53.440]  Mexican wrestlers,
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:56.240]  but more people are doing that now
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:57.780]  in the AEW stuff.
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:25:59.620]  Wearing masks and stuff?
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:01.900]  Different gimmicks, different looks and stuff.
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:02.320]  That's awesome.
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.840]  Can someone make some?
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.980]  They're not good yet. I need to buy different vinyl.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:08.900]  My vinyl's not right.
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.080]  Someday you'll have to show me your treasure.
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:14.140]  I have like seven sitting on a couch because I get done with them
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:16.280]  and I just toss them aside. Are we opening these Flux or what?
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:17.980]  What are the Flux cards?
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:20.480]  Let's open one more pack from the pack sack
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:21.220]  and then we'll get to the Flux.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.360]  Still haven't found a Zimmer. It's been a minute since we've had a Zimmer.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:24.760]  Yep.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.540]  And we're not going to find it in the Lion King.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.420]  God damn it.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.020]  I just watched this for the first time recently.
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:32.700]  Hang on, that's Little Mermaid.
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.860]  You're thinking of...
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:36.400]  That was under the sea.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:40.220]  I just can't wait to be king is what I was thinking of.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.360]  But then I sang the one with the...
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:44.440]  I was close.
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:47.360]  In the jungle, the mighty jungle.
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:50.180]  Rafiki is a card.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:50.800]  There he is.
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:53.480]  These are sticky too.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.200]  Oh no.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.280]  Here's Mufasa.
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.000]  Feeling the love tonight.
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:06.320]  That's Nala.
[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.560]  They're going to kiss on the lips like cats?
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.260]  That's me.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:17.680]  And then...
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:18.260]  And then...
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:19.740]  These fucking things.
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.520]  Can we open Flux now?
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.200]  I don't know what Flux is.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:24.780]  What is a Flux?
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:28.020]  This is a box of cards I've been waiting to open for a while.
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:29.960]  What are they?
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:31.580]  This is NBA. NBA Flux.
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.460]  This is the first year...
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:34.840]  He's getting serious.
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:39.260]  This is the first year...
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:40.080]  How many packs are in this thing?
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:40.600]  10 packs.
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:42.080]  And they're 5 cards each?
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.680]  And how much was the box?
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.120]  I paid $260.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:48.720]  That's cheap.
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.820]  $260 for this pack, Shane.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.060]  For you guys.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:55.580]  For the audience.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.980]  It's true. These are Geoff's cards.
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:58.880]  I need everyone to know that.
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.420]  We don't have the budget for this.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.880]  Rooster Teeth doesn't pay for any of this shit.
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:04.540]  Are you looking for a skate deck?
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:04.840]  Yeah.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.180]  Skate decks are on sale. Please go buy these.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.460]  We put them up. I brought one in.
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:11.880]  Just so you can see them.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:12.800]  Go buy the Tiki Mug.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:16.600]  I forgot the Tiki Mug.
[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:18.860]  Are the Tiki Mugs still available?
[01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:19.360]  Yeah.
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:20.740]  There can't be that much left.
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:24.340]  We've sold so fucking many.
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:25.080]  Jesus Christ.
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.860]  They made so fucking many more.
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:30.160]  It was really absurd when they told us the number they made.
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:32.260]  Get it now before it's never again.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.400]  We're never making more for sure.
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:36.500]  These cards are Flux.
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.300]  This is the first year they've made an independent series of Flux.
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:42.380]  They used to be an insert in Chronicles.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:42.880]  I believe.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:44.120]  Every year.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:46.480]  They're pretty popular.
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:48.360]  You're really serious about this.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.400]  He's in the position.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:51.660]  I bought these a month ago.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.000]  I've just been sitting there looking at them.
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:55.300]  Why didn't we do this two weeks ago?
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:28:59.500]  Alright, here we go.
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.440]  This is where the money is.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:01.780]  Cory Joseph, boom.
[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:03.980]  I've already got 50 of them.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.040]  Any time you get a Mark of Smart in a pack, you know you've got a good box.
[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:10.280]  Russell Westbrook, Flow Motion.
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:11.740]  Flow Motion is somewhere else.
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:13.300]  KG, Kevin Garnett.
[01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:14.000]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:15.500]  And then Moe Harkless.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.520]  Now for Indies, we're looking for Prisms, Parallels, Autos.
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.000]  Joe, we're looking for Autos.
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:25.920]  Malcolm Brogdon.
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.220]  We've got Malcolm Brogdon.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.020]  He might be up for grabs.
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:30.420]  Before the trade deadline.
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:31.660]  Here we go.
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:34.020]  Vucevic plays for the Bulls.
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:35.520]  Oh, here we go.
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.500]  That's a cool parallel.
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:41.260]  69 of 75.
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:43.740]  It's Joe Ingles.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:45.900]  Unfortunately, it is Joe Ingles.
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:47.860]  But it is a cool parallel, nonetheless.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:49.820]  Joe Ingles hurt right now.
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:51.040]  I think he got an ACL tear.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:52.640]  He's 35.
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:54.040]  Swears he'll be back.
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:55.860]  Probably not.
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:57.520]  Swears he'll be back.
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:58.180]  The G League?
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:59.680]  Steven Adams.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.880]  And then Onyeka Okungwu.
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:03.280]  Which is a good Ricky Cardle.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.520]  Do you want to sleep with Marcus Smart?
[01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:08.240]  That was crazy that he just left it in there.
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.480]  I think it's because I have like 40 of them at home.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.840]  Right, right, right, right.
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:13.900]  So many.
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:17.160]  I actually already have this one.
[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:19.040]  Actually, I have like 15 of these.
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:22.360]  Is there a guaranteed Auto in these, Geoff?
[01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:25.680]  What there is, is a guaranteed uncirculated
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.640]  encased card. You get one card per box.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.960]  This is where the money will or won't be, probably.
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:31.340]  Do you think it will?
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:32.980]  No. Not with my luck.
[01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:34.160]  How come these cards aren't sticky?
[01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:36.740]  John Morant. Nobody beat off on these.
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:38.440]  The Joker.
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:39.700]  Jared Allen.
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.140]  That Jared Allen is Prism.
[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:43.780]  I met that guy.
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.900]  When I worked at Razer, he came to Razer.
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:48.780]  He's like a big gamer.
[01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:51.720]  Actually, he's communicated with Gavin
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:52.980]  and I on Twitter a couple times.
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.200]  He's so fucking tall.
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:55.600]  He's so fucking tall.
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:59.040]  Also, I do think that every time
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.480]  there's a UT player,
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:01.640]  Mike keeps throwing up the horns.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:03.200]  Mike's hooking them back here.
[01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:06.400]  McCall Bridges and Grant Hill.
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:07.760]  He drinks Sprite!
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:09.520]  Grant Hill drinks Sprite!
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.360]  Grant Hill's a cool dude, man.
[01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:14.420]  He's famous for getting up.
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:16.500]  It was a commercial in the 90s where Grant Hill drinks Sprite.
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:17.160]  Don't worry about it.
[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:19.200]  Here we go.
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:21.840]  What do we have here?
[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:23.460]  We have James Harden.
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:26.840]  We've got a Troposphere card.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:27.760]  These are cool.
[01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:29.240]  It's Darius Baisley.
[01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:32.200]  What is Troposphere?
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:34.280]  It's just like the name of this insert.
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:36.860]  What does that mean?
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:37.440]  I don't know.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:39.360]  There's a bunch of different sphere cards.
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.120]  I'm sure it means something science-y.
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:43.260]  Gordon Hayward.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.160]  Did you ever watch the video?
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:47.080]  You couldn't do it?
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:49.260]  Gordon Hayward famously,
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:51.600]  in his first game for the Celtics,
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:52.600]  when he got traded to the Celtics,
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.880]  snapped his leg in half.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:54.920]  I was watching it live.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:56.780]  Almost threw up.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.820]  Two nights ago,
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:02.080]  got what they're calling a high ankle sprain.
[01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:04.080]  Is that what they're calling it?
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.420]  Yeah, they're calling it that.
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:07.940]  It's the same thing, bent sideways again.
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:11.620]  Maybe it was the hardware that bent.
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:13.520]  It was fucking...
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.220]  I couldn't get there.
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:16.220]  Oh shit, here we go. Hold on.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.520]  Demar DeRozan, who's having a fucking
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:20.720]  killer year for the Bulls.
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:23.980]  And then, the man, the legend.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.780]  The round mound
[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:27.540]  of rebounds, Sir Charles.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.720]  The man who forever
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:31.800]  shaped how I view
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:33.320]  celebrities and celebrity.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:34.820]  One of the most influential
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.580]  moments of my life was meeting Charles Barkley
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:38.760]  and the disappointment
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:40.500]  that ensued.
[01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:42.820]  Just started listening to his podcast,
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:43.900]  The Steam Room with him and Ernie.
[01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:45.860]  Already my favorite podcast.
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:49.460]  Named his daughter after a mall.
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:50.800]  Really liked the name
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.600]  of that shopping mall and decided
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:53.500]  to name his child that.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:55.920]  Miles Turner,
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.060]  Zach Levine. Oh, here we go.
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:32:59.640]  Moe Harkless, Red Parallel.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:01.960]  DeAndre Ayton.
[01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:03.820]  Does not get enough respect for how good he is.
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:05.620]  They don't want to give him a max contractor.
[01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:07.240]  I don't under-fucking-stand it. He's phenomenal.
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:09.420]  Kenyon Martin Jr. Yeah, he is.
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:11.720]  They keep being like
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.700]  a deceptively good team.
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:14.400]  The Suns? Yeah.
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:16.660]  They are, like,
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.760]  tough, man.
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:21.660]  Trey Young,
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:23.520]  Ice Trey, I thought
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.220]  His hair looks better than that than it does.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.940]  I thought he didn't stand a chance
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:29.000]  in the NBA.
[01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:30.720]  I thought he was way too fragile.
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:33.340]  Holy shit.
[01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:34.580]  Was I wrong? Huh.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.060]  Goddamn, that dude is good.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:38.500]  Corey Joseph. Ooh!
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:39.680]  Jayden McDaniels.
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:43.580]  Jayden McDaniels.
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:44.940]  Influx card. Rookie Influx.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:45.380]  That's cool.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.720]  Keldon Johnson, and then
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:51.460]  Saban Lee rookie. Another Detroit rookie.
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:53.220]  And a lot of good core there
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:53.960]  in Detroit.
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:56.340]  How are you feeling about these so far?
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:33:59.300]  It's about what I expected.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:00.180]  I don't ever get shit.
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:01.320]  Kimball Walker.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:04.120]  I don't know what this means. He's sitting on the fucking floor.
[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:05.460]  And I'm having fun.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.600]  Oh, fuck, dude. Here we go.
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:09.640]  Oh, that's on card!
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.600]  Oh, auto on card, Joe!
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:13.840]  Xavier Tillman, rookie.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.580]  On card, private signings.
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.520]  Oh, boy!
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:21.680]  Two on card autos.
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:24.060]  That's a private signing. Do you think that they went into a room
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:25.760]  by themselves to sign it?
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.600]  Somebody handed him a bunch of cards.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:28.680]  Shh, don't tell.
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:30.260]  That's cool.
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:32.600]  That's a cool card.
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.180]  It's auto on card, bro.
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.200]  Here we go. D. Wade
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.180]  Prism. That's nice.
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:41.780]  Julius
[01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:43.720]  Randall having a rough year for the
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:45.660]  Knicks. A lot of
[01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:47.560]  rumors that he might be traded or asking for
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:48.980]  trade. Royce O'Neal.
[01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:53.180]  What is cheating?
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.720]  He's having an off year. A lot of people saying
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:56.960]  that he's regressed for the mean.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.680]  I thought that was him.
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:34:59.860]  See, he wants to know.
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.320]  I'm like, why is he asking?
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:04.720]  Did he cheat?
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:07.680]  Demonta Sabonis just got
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:08.960]  traded to the
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.780]  end of the NBA. Sacramento Kings.
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:13.520]  We were just talking about that.
[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:15.560]  So sad.
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:16.860]  They really should give it up.
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:18.980]  Kobe White, I would love it.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.520]  Jalen Smith incoming. Flux
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:23.820]  rookie card. He's got cool glasses.
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:25.460]  Markel Fultz.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:27.760]  Former number one
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.740]  drafted player in the world.
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:31.800]  Got drafted by the
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:33.680]  Philadelphia 76ers
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.860]  during the rebuild process. And they broke
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:36.960]  his shot. And he's never been the same.
[01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:39.320]  Zeke Nagy. Trust the process.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:41.880]  Zion
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:43.060]  still not playing? No.
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:44.680]  And nobody seems to know when.
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.160]  He's rehabbing
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.000]  Awesome.
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:54.820]  I own a box of
[01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:57.080]  unopened Zion cards. I'm like, I'm going to save
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.760]  these. These are going to be valuable.
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:00.340]  These are the one things I'm not going to get into.
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:02.800]  One of us. I did.
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:05.240]  Tim Hardaway Jr.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.280]  His dad was Tim Hardaway.
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:10.580]  Famous for the UTEP two-step.
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:12.960]  What do we got?
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:13.960]  Red Parallel?
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:16.200]  Jaden McDaniels, rookie, Red Parallel.
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.500]  That's a pretty cool card.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:19.820]  Oh, the big
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:21.200]  Aristotle, Shaquille O'Neal.
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:22.520]  There you go.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:25.720]  Started listening to his podcast too, The Big Show.
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:27.580]  Also good. Not as good as Steam Room, but still pretty good.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:29.880]  Then Dario
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:30.380]  Sarek.
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:34.080]  There you go. Last pack.
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:36.000]  And then we'll open the uncirculated
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.960]  encased card. Oh my god, that's our big ending?
[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:39.880]  And then we're going to... Now, does the
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:41.820]  on-card auto make you think
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:43.920]  the encased card is more or less valuable?
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:45.300]  More, probably more.
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:46.960]  Giannis,
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:48.960]  Steph Curry,
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:50.900]  Tyrese Halliburton.
[01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:53.900]  Just got traded for Damontess
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:55.840]  Sabonis. Now he's an Indiana
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:58.160]  pacer. Now he's in the middle of the NBA.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:00.320]  Dante DiVincenzo,
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:01.840]  who apparently the Bucks are trying to
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.580]  deal before the trade deadline. And then
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:05.960]  Kira Lewis Jr. for the Pelicans.
[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:07.340]  Is it time?
[01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.000]  This is the last card we're going to open.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.040]  This is the last one.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.840]  This is the uncirculated encased card.
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:14.620]  I'm excited. Me too.
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:16.060]  Geoff thinks it's going to be valuable.
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.520]  I'm going to say it's the opposite.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.700]  What is it? It's valuable. Is it?
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:22.660]  Is it? What did you get?
[01:37:27.730 --> 01:37:28.850]  Not as valuable as I thought.
[01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:31.030]  Giannis...
[01:37:33.210 --> 01:37:34.090]  I thought
[01:37:34.090 --> 01:37:35.850]  all of these uncirculated
[01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:37.150]  cards were numbered.
[01:37:37.150 --> 01:37:38.250]  Uh huh.
[01:37:39.970 --> 01:37:41.270]  Maybe it trick you.
[01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:42.290]  Is it just a base?
[01:37:43.050 --> 01:37:44.350]  Maybe it do a trick on you.
[01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:45.930]  It is an uncirculated...
[01:37:47.650 --> 01:37:48.650]  It's a cool card.
[01:37:48.730 --> 01:37:49.610]  It's the Giannis Titan.
[01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:52.250]  I thought that it would be...
[01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:53.770]  I can't tell if that's a scratch or part of it.
[01:37:54.710 --> 01:37:57.110]  I thought that it would be numbered, but it doesn't appear to be.
[01:37:57.150 --> 01:37:57.790]  It says number 11.
[01:37:58.230 --> 01:37:59.590]  Well, it is. I appreciate that.
[01:37:59.950 --> 01:38:02.890]  That is an uncirculated Giannis card.
[01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.650]  That's pretty cool.
[01:38:03.650 --> 01:38:04.850]  Or Titan.
[01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:06.490]  One of those per box.
[01:38:07.610 --> 01:38:09.690]  And I'm not sure if this is a scratch
[01:38:09.690 --> 01:38:11.170]  or not.
[01:38:11.330 --> 01:38:13.010]  Hey, Flux Cards!
[01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:14.370]  What the fuck?
[01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:17.890]  Contact us. What are you selling?
[01:38:18.730 --> 01:38:20.110]  Unnumbered? Big scratch?
[01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:22.070]  Fuckface. Care of Geoff Ramsey.
[01:38:22.290 --> 01:38:22.950]  Yeah, what are you doing?
[01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:24.610]  Just go ahead and send me a replacement card.
[01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:27.430]  Number it to less than 50, please.
[01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:27.790]  Thank you.
[01:38:29.150 --> 01:38:29.930]  There you go.
[01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:32.230]  Didn't he get 50 nuggets?
[01:38:32.890 --> 01:38:34.010]  Because of the Chick-fil-A?
[01:38:34.330 --> 01:38:35.570]  Didn't he get the Chick-fil-A nuggets?
[01:38:35.970 --> 01:38:37.750]  Oh, yeah. That was like his thing.
[01:38:38.230 --> 01:38:39.690]  Yeah, he scored like 50 points
[01:38:39.690 --> 01:38:41.910]  in the playoff. In the game he won the championships.
[01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.790]  Hey, Geoff.
[01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.350]  Yeah.
[01:38:45.450 --> 01:38:47.010]  Somebody has it listed here.
[01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:50.110]  Is that a Titan, one silver, uncirculated, Panini sealed?
[01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:50.550]  Yeah.
[01:38:51.130 --> 01:38:53.430]  Somebody has it listed here for $2.60, our best offer.
[01:38:53.670 --> 01:38:54.350]  Oh, okay.
[01:38:54.690 --> 01:38:57.710]  Don't worry. Someone also has Panini, Flex, Titan,
[01:38:57.710 --> 01:39:00.350]  uncirculated. It's also for $40.
[01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:01.070]  Yeah.
[01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:03.850]  Just because they sell it for that doesn't mean anybody is going to buy it for that.
[01:39:03.850 --> 01:39:05.090]  They say like a recently sold.
[01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:07.470]  Also, $124 for this other one.
[01:39:07.690 --> 01:39:09.090]  These prices are wild.
[01:39:09.450 --> 01:39:09.690]  Yeah.
[01:39:10.810 --> 01:39:12.950]  Well, if that had been like a numbered
[01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:15.030]  like lamello rookie, then
[01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:16.470]  we'd be talking in the
[01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:19.390]  small, like five figures probably.
[01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:20.050]  What?
[01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:20.930]  Yeah.
[01:39:22.130 --> 01:39:23.050]  A ten grand?
[01:39:23.050 --> 01:39:23.830]  Oh my God.
[01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:26.170]  If it was numbered, low enough, maybe.
[01:39:27.170 --> 01:39:27.930]  Like a one of one?
[01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:31.310]  Well, yeah, but if it was even like one of five or one of ten, maybe.
[01:39:32.170 --> 01:39:33.270]  And does the number
[01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:34.710]  matter within the set?
[01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:36.970]  So like is a one of five of a one,
[01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:38.910]  like a one of a one of five more valuable
[01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:39.810]  than a two of five?
[01:39:40.190 --> 01:39:43.210]  Not necessarily. Some people like to collect the first
[01:39:43.210 --> 01:39:44.750]  number or the last number,
[01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:46.690]  but the one that's considered valuable
[01:39:46.690 --> 01:39:49.010]  is usually if you can get a numbered
[01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:51.250]  card and the number is the same as their jersey.
[01:39:51.250 --> 01:39:53.250]  So like for Marcus Smart, if you got a number
[01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:55.590]  36, that would be
[01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:56.670]  considered cool.
[01:39:56.770 --> 01:39:58.730]  Well, Geoff, how do you feel about your card openings?
[01:39:59.130 --> 01:40:00.670]  That was fun. I had a really good time.
[01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:03.310]  I mean, I'm happy
[01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:04.950]  to get the honest. I wish it
[01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:05.930]  wasn't scratched.
[01:40:06.970 --> 01:40:08.150]  I can't tell if it's scratched.
[01:40:08.150 --> 01:40:10.370]  He's a very grateful, content little angel.
[01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:12.910]  He would never be ungrateful,
[01:40:14.090 --> 01:40:15.430]  but the sadness
[01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:16.590]  is palpable.
[01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:19.230]  The disappointment. Last night, as we were walking Henry
[01:40:19.230 --> 01:40:21.310]  for his nightly TT and 2-2,
[01:40:21.850 --> 01:40:23.230]  he said, I can't wait
[01:40:23.230 --> 01:40:25.210]  to open up that Flux and it's going to have a
[01:40:25.210 --> 01:40:26.170]  thing, it's going to be numbered.
[01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:29.090]  And it's not, but it's okay.
[01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:30.770]  You still had fun. I was pretty excited.
[01:40:30.890 --> 01:40:33.450]  You still got on the floor. I did get on the floor because I was getting into it.
[01:40:34.010 --> 01:40:34.950]  So I will
[01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:36.690]  go ahead and emboss
[01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:39.410]  348 more of these cards.
[01:40:39.650 --> 01:40:39.990]  Follow
[01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:43.230]  at FuckFacePod on
[01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:45.290]  Twitter and on
[01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:47.330]  Instagram. We'll keep you up to date
[01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:49.490]  on when these wrist pocket rockets
[01:40:49.490 --> 01:40:50.950]  or whatever are going on sale.
[01:40:51.690 --> 01:40:53.710]  And Geoff will emboss a bunch of cards.
[01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:54.630]  You might get
[01:40:55.130 --> 01:40:57.010]  Sexy Bikini Girl, you might get
[01:40:57.010 --> 01:40:59.230]  NXT, you might get
[01:40:59.230 --> 01:41:00.910]  Hunchback of Notre Dame.
[01:41:02.650 --> 01:41:03.290]  You might get
[01:41:03.290 --> 01:41:05.470]  a Marcus Smart. There might be a rare
[01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:07.410]  Geoff Otto on card
[01:41:07.410 --> 01:41:09.490]  Marcus Smart. I might go back
[01:41:09.490 --> 01:41:11.210]  and throw some Alf cards
[01:41:11.210 --> 01:41:12.690]  in, you never know.
[01:41:12.850 --> 01:41:13.750]  He's back in card form.
[01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:15.770]  So anything that we've opened
[01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:17.870]  here is fair game to get embossed
[01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:19.870]  and sent when we put these things on sale.
[01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:21.810]  So if you're always looking for a
[01:41:21.810 --> 01:41:23.770]  purse but say this purse is too big, get me
[01:41:23.770 --> 01:41:25.530]  a small one to put directly on my wrist.
[01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:27.890]  I want to maintain positive control of my
[01:41:27.890 --> 01:41:28.190]  items.
[01:41:30.130 --> 01:41:30.930]  Positive control.
[01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:33.150]  I will say, I think it's the perfect
[01:41:35.250 --> 01:41:36.050]  scrumping device.
[01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:37.750]  Wow, it's perfect for
[01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.930]  one Apple.
[01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:41.310]  I wish I had an Apple to show that it's
[01:41:41.310 --> 01:41:43.290]  perfect Apple size. Hey, there's something about
[01:41:43.290 --> 01:41:45.190]  the size of an Apple right out front here.
[01:41:45.450 --> 01:41:47.210]  Right in front of Shaq that you could
[01:41:47.210 --> 01:41:49.270]  show. Oh yeah, check this
[01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:51.230]  out too. Boom, we got
[01:41:51.230 --> 01:41:52.930]  them made. It's the Fuckface
[01:41:52.930 --> 01:41:54.090]  Official Baseball
[01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:56.670]  Rawlings Official
[01:41:57.250 --> 01:41:59.330]  F-S-O-L-B-1 League. You know
[01:41:59.330 --> 01:41:59.990]  it. Wow.
[01:42:02.610 --> 01:42:03.410]  So what
[01:42:03.410 --> 01:42:05.270]  we're going to do with these is we're
[01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:07.130]  going to take the official Fuckface baseball bat.
[01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:09.210]  Mike, get a load of this. Wait until you hear
[01:42:09.210 --> 01:42:11.450]  about how Geoff is going to autograph these.
[01:42:11.930 --> 01:42:12.670]  Here's what we're going to do.
[01:42:12.930 --> 01:42:14.150]  We're going to take the baseball bat here.
[01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:16.870]  I have a wood burner, right?
[01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:18.970]  I'm going to burn my name
[01:42:20.170 --> 01:42:21.250]  backwards probably 20
[01:42:21.250 --> 01:42:23.250]  times across the barrel of the bat all around
[01:42:23.250 --> 01:42:25.210]  it. Just my signature over and over again. Then we're
[01:42:25.210 --> 01:42:27.110]  going to dip it in paint. Then we're going to
[01:42:27.110 --> 01:42:29.110]  go to a batting cage. We're going to shoot
[01:42:29.110 --> 01:42:30.850]  the balls at me and I'm going to tag them
[01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:33.110]  and that's how I'll autograph each ball.
[01:42:33.190 --> 01:42:34.730]  How many balls are there, Geoff? 350.
[01:42:34.730 --> 01:42:36.730]  I want
[01:42:38.770 --> 01:42:41.110]  a thousand, but they only gave me 350.
[01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:43.250]  So anyway, at some point we'll sell
[01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:44.990]  these autographed with
[01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:47.310]  my signature and part of it
[01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:49.210]  in some way. Probably some dirt
[01:42:49.210 --> 01:42:51.210]  on it as well. He'll take 350
[01:42:51.210 --> 01:42:53.110]  swings. How many he'll connect on
[01:42:54.150 --> 01:42:55.230]  remains to be seen.
[01:42:55.390 --> 01:42:57.230]  The less I connect on, the rarer
[01:42:57.230 --> 01:42:59.130]  the signatures will be. It's true. And it'll be
[01:42:59.130 --> 01:43:01.450]  random. You'll either get one... Geoff, on ball
[01:43:01.450 --> 01:43:02.730]  auto. Incredible.
[01:43:03.050 --> 01:43:03.630]  On ball auto.
[01:43:04.610 --> 01:43:05.770]  Most unique way
[01:43:05.770 --> 01:43:07.190]  to sign a baseball
[01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:09.630]  in history. We're also not going to be able to
[01:43:09.630 --> 01:43:10.890]  do this at a batting cage
[01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:13.710]  because no batting cage is going to let us swing paint
[01:43:13.710 --> 01:43:15.410]  all over the place. That's what like Dexter
[01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:17.090]  Plastics for. Money talks.
[01:43:17.670 --> 01:43:19.210]  Dexter Plastics. It's fine.
[01:43:19.470 --> 01:43:21.510]  There you go. I was just looking
[01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:23.530]  on your merch page and you guys
[01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:25.610]  got cute koozies. Like a whole little
[01:43:25.610 --> 01:43:27.110]  koozie pack. Oh yeah, koozie pack.
[01:43:27.170 --> 01:43:28.750]  Yeah, there's like a... VCK
[01:43:29.690 --> 01:43:30.890]  If you're looking for
[01:43:30.890 --> 01:43:32.990]  If you're looking for a bunch
[01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:34.230]  of things to keep your
[01:43:34.690 --> 01:43:36.730]  your drinks cool.
[01:43:37.170 --> 01:43:39.030]  Grab an Ian, a uniform
[01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:41.170]  uniform, no scrumping
[01:43:41.170 --> 01:43:42.910]  or a Zimmer zone. I
[01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:45.010]  don't have any of those. They didn't give them to me.
[01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:46.910]  I have a Vancouver child kicker one
[01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:48.950]  but I don't have these. I think they're like, these are just
[01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:50.910]  now getting out there and we're going to get them soon. And there's still
[01:43:50.910 --> 01:43:52.870]  some tiki mugs. It's only $13.
[01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:54.690]  Well, $12.95. It's not even $13.
[01:43:54.690 --> 01:43:56.950]  For a four pack. Wow. Yep.
[01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:59.090]  I'd have to bargain. Like the koozie one
[01:43:59.090 --> 01:44:00.850]  if you click on that second picture
[01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:03.370]  that's the one. And then you scroll up a little bit
[01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:05.050]  the backs are awesome because it's
[01:44:05.050 --> 01:44:06.890]  combining the fabric of the farm with the power of one uniform.
[01:44:07.010 --> 01:44:08.310]  Cute. With a little apple.
[01:44:09.490 --> 01:44:10.250]  Isn't that cool?
[01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:13.030]  So these are, they'll be on
[01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:14.470]  sale now, but
[01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:16.590]  we'll be able to show these off pretty soon.
[01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:19.030]  There you go. There's your phone. Thank you so much
[01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:21.010]  for tuning in for another episode of
[01:44:21.010 --> 01:44:23.110]  Fuck, Face, Break Shit. Next time we'll be on our permanent
[01:44:23.110 --> 01:44:25.030]  set. We'll open more of your mail
[01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:27.350]  cards. We'll open more of these boxes
[01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:29.550]  that I have just been buying and accumulating
[01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:31.290]  over time that we're not getting any closer
[01:44:31.290 --> 01:44:32.750]  to getting through.
[01:44:33.370 --> 01:44:34.630]  And maybe we'll have,
[01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:36.690]  we'll get some more on card autos.
[01:44:36.850 --> 01:44:39.410]  Or maybe we'll get some more band-aids. Maybe Gavin will be here, but you know
[01:44:39.410 --> 01:44:41.170]  what? Andrew definitely will.
[01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:43.610]  And that's really all I need, baby.
[01:44:43.890 --> 01:44:45.330]  I think the most important thing is
[01:44:45.330 --> 01:44:47.250]  Don Zimmer being there. Let's hope.
[01:44:47.530 --> 01:44:49.330]  We've been in a bit of a Zimmer drought.
[01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:49.910]  That's true.
[01:44:51.450 --> 01:44:53.350]  Let's hope we return to the...
[01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:54.310]  Whoa!
[01:44:55.010 --> 01:44:56.310]  If I can like
[01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:57.990]  cut them out, yeah.
[01:44:59.670 --> 01:45:04.150]  Well, thanks for watching.
[01:45:04.830 --> 01:45:06.430]  See you next time. Bye.
[01:45:07.170 --> 01:45:07.850]  Okay.
