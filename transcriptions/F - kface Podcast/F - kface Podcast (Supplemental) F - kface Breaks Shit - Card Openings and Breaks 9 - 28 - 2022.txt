[00:11.620 --> 00:17.160]  Hello and welcome to another episode of Face Break Shit.
[00:17.160 --> 00:21.500]  You said you were going to hit the fucking button. He's off to a great start. I'm busy. Sorry.
[00:21.820 --> 00:26.180]  This is only the first one of these I've been invited to. I agree. It's the first one you've ever shown up to. Yes.
[00:26.420 --> 00:32.060]  We all agree. This is a bit of a surprise break show because we...
[00:32.060 --> 00:36.520]  Well, Eric and I were just so busy. I thought. We were just so busy. Almost cancelled it this morning.
[00:37.160 --> 00:40.320]  Oh, that would have been awkward. I tried to cancel it. The reason we're here...
[00:40.320 --> 00:45.660]  The reason we're here is because Eric held my feet to the fire. He was like, no, sir.
[00:45.680 --> 00:50.840]  Yeah, no shit. He was like, I learned from Minch. From Gus. I can't give you an inch.
[00:50.860 --> 00:55.120]  Who's Minch? I learned from Gus. I can't give you an inch. Learned from Minch.
[00:55.520 --> 00:59.520]  Dude, I did. I just did like three back to back to back interviews for Block Island.
[00:59.680 --> 01:03.880]  Oh yeah? Different headspace right now. It's a good show. You should check it out. First members, check it out.
[01:03.880 --> 01:04.580]  Block Island.
[01:07.880 --> 01:11.140]  That's a learning curve. I was almost like, yeah, I did. Oh, that'd be a spoiler.
[01:12.420 --> 01:15.940]  Don't do that. Don't ruin the show. It would suck so bad.
[01:16.360 --> 01:19.140]  Episode four came out today or tomorrow? Tomorrow, I think.
[01:20.100 --> 01:22.040]  It's a good episode. It's a good episode. Very excited.
[01:23.180 --> 01:27.040]  OK, so a bit of a, like I said, a bit of a thrown together surprise episode.
[01:27.180 --> 01:30.100]  So if you're here, congratulations on being on the ball.
[01:31.540 --> 01:33.880]  Paying attention. Thank you. I appreciate that. I'm on the ball.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.260]  This is for the real fans. This is for the real fans.
[01:37.580 --> 01:42.500]  The real heads. That's right. That's what's up. The freaks with a Z, baby.
[01:43.420 --> 01:44.140]  The Minches.
[01:46.340 --> 01:49.620]  What are we opening first, Geoff? Well, quick order of business.
[01:50.660 --> 01:54.380]  I had an idea this morning, and I told it to Eric, and Eric said, that's OK.
[01:54.380 --> 02:00.240]  I want to rename this show from Face Break Shit to just The Break Show.
[02:00.340 --> 02:02.520]  Yeah, me too. I thought he was going to do that. No swears or anything.
[02:02.900 --> 02:04.580]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just The Break Show. No asterisks.
[02:04.760 --> 02:07.440]  From here on out, this is the first episode of The Break Show.
[02:07.680 --> 02:09.760]  I saw you. I saw you. That was good. I got excited.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.720]  Can I give you another order of business? Please.
[02:12.900 --> 02:15.640]  We are getting dangerously close to baseballs coming out.
[02:15.760 --> 02:21.500]  If you're watching this live, the 30th at noon...
[02:21.500 --> 02:23.200]  No, I just realized it was in a weird place. Oh, that's cool.
[02:23.200 --> 02:25.360]  Mike doesn't complain, so I'll keep it here.
[02:25.480 --> 02:27.240]  He put it in his belly button. 30th at noon.
[02:28.660 --> 02:30.980]  That's in two days. Yes, it is. If you're watching this live.
[02:31.060 --> 02:34.260]  If you're watching this after it has come out on YouTube.
[02:34.280 --> 02:35.640]  That's tomorrow. And that's it. What's up?
[02:35.640 --> 02:37.700]  Who's on your T-shirt? Orange Cassidy?
[02:38.120 --> 02:40.200]  No, the T-shirt of the T-shirt. Orange Cassidy.
[02:40.360 --> 02:45.040]  So Eric, he insulted me earlier for wearing my Savannah Bananas hat.
[02:45.460 --> 02:47.640]  You've been rocking that hat for like a month now.
[02:47.640 --> 02:51.920]  I like it very much. And he was like, you keep wearing it instead of Rooster Teeth merch on shows.
[02:52.580 --> 02:53.740]  You're not promoting our gear.
[02:53.860 --> 02:57.180]  Yeah, do you know what the difference is? I don't only wear this fucking shirt.
[02:57.380 --> 02:58.540]  Well, I just got through a hat cycle.
[02:58.660 --> 03:00.740]  I'm wearing a Rooster Teeth shirt. This is a Geoff shirt.
[03:01.040 --> 03:01.260]  Yeah.
[03:02.080 --> 03:02.620]  Buy this.
[03:02.880 --> 03:04.560]  You can wear whatever hat you want.
[03:04.660 --> 03:08.040]  I will say I did my hair today because I knew you were going to wear a hat.
[03:08.160 --> 03:09.840]  And I knew you were going to wear a hat.
[03:09.900 --> 03:10.940]  Well, can I say...
[03:10.940 --> 03:11.160]  Uh-huh.
[03:12.040 --> 03:12.420]  Looks good.
[03:12.500 --> 03:13.020]  Thank you very much.
[03:13.060 --> 03:13.500]  Good hair.
[03:13.600 --> 03:15.680]  Looks like somebody just got a snazzy haircut.
[03:15.720 --> 03:18.780]  Got a haircut yesterday from my barber Geoffrey at Wyatt's.
[03:18.780 --> 03:19.360]  Was it J. Geoffrey?
[03:19.580 --> 03:20.500]  No, with a G. Geoffrey.
[03:20.500 --> 03:21.140]  No.
[03:21.360 --> 03:23.200]  G-E-O-F-F-R-E-Y?
[03:23.360 --> 03:23.900]  R-E-Y.
[03:24.000 --> 03:24.960]  Does he know about me?
[03:25.160 --> 03:26.200]  He knows of you.
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.380]  Because every time we see him, he goes,
[03:28.520 --> 03:29.500]  What's the...
[03:30.340 --> 03:30.700]  Emily's...
[03:30.700 --> 03:32.580]  You guys do the podcast or whatever.
[03:32.800 --> 03:33.580]  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:33.680 --> 03:34.460]  Oh, he knows Emily?
[03:34.640 --> 03:34.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:35.140 --> 03:36.500]  I'm surprised you're not in the Facebook group.
[03:36.640 --> 03:37.200]  All the Geoffreys.
[03:37.940 --> 03:38.660]  I was.
[03:38.880 --> 03:39.560]  I might still be.
[03:39.600 --> 03:41.660]  I'm actually in a Jack Pattillo Facebook group.
[03:41.900 --> 03:42.220]  I'm in it.
[03:42.820 --> 03:44.040]  There's like six of us.
[03:44.200 --> 03:46.100]  I don't ever use Facebook, but there were like six of us.
[03:46.140 --> 03:48.800]  But one was like massive conservative dude.
[03:48.900 --> 03:49.200]  I'm like, all right.
[03:49.200 --> 03:49.820]  Okay, I'm out.
[03:49.980 --> 03:51.340]  I mean, it's Facebook, so of course it is.
[03:51.440 --> 03:53.140]  I was in a Geoffrey Facebook group.
[03:53.260 --> 03:56.520]  And I might still be, but I haven't been on Facebook in 11 years.
[03:56.940 --> 03:58.020]  So I wouldn't know.
[03:58.020 --> 03:58.500]  Literally the worst.
[03:59.040 --> 04:01.640]  So we'll start it off by opening up something from the past.
[04:01.980 --> 04:02.760]  You want me to open it for you?
[04:02.920 --> 04:04.000]  Packs that I've never done before.
[04:04.240 --> 04:04.960]  No, we don't need that just yet.
[04:04.960 --> 04:05.480]  No, we don't need that.
[04:05.620 --> 04:07.000]  Do you not open packs with this?
[04:07.040 --> 04:07.700]  Not, no.
[04:08.040 --> 04:08.540]  Not packs.
[04:08.540 --> 04:09.280]  All right, I'm just going to grab some crap.
[04:09.360 --> 04:10.240]  Yeah, that's what I'm looking for.
[04:10.840 --> 04:11.680]  Okay, that's what we're going to open.
[04:11.760 --> 04:13.800]  We also have some of these extra packs that we showed,
[04:13.900 --> 04:15.740]  if you followed us on Instagram.
[04:16.000 --> 04:16.880]  We did Instagram Live.
[04:16.880 --> 04:20.300]  We have some extra packs of some fun stuff that we'll be opening as well.
[04:20.380 --> 04:21.780]  We'll start with...
[04:21.780 --> 04:24.020]  I just can't wait to be king.
[04:24.560 --> 04:25.360]  Lion King.
[04:25.600 --> 04:27.020]  I got more Lion King cards.
[04:27.320 --> 04:28.580]  Everybody says do this.
[04:28.940 --> 04:29.940]  I hate their Lion King cards.
[04:30.060 --> 04:31.940]  The Lion King cards aren't good.
[04:32.420 --> 04:34.160]  You know, I've only seen the Lion King once.
[04:34.880 --> 04:35.200]  The movie?
[04:35.560 --> 04:35.820]  Yeah.
[04:35.980 --> 04:36.780]  The live action anime.
[04:37.340 --> 04:38.060]  I've never seen the live action.
[04:38.900 --> 04:41.240]  I've only seen the live action Lion King.
[04:41.520 --> 04:43.940]  I've only seen the cartoon Lion King movie once.
[04:44.000 --> 04:44.760]  It was on a date.
[04:44.840 --> 04:46.800]  And the girl dumped popcorn on me.
[04:46.800 --> 04:47.920]  She thought it would be funny.
[04:49.420 --> 04:50.700]  That's what I remember about that movie.
[04:50.800 --> 04:51.020]  Okay.
[04:51.140 --> 04:52.840]  Well, let's have a look at these cards that you don't remember.
[04:52.840 --> 04:54.080]  You just couldn't wait to be king, I guess.
[04:54.340 --> 04:54.740]  Nala.
[04:54.920 --> 04:55.180]  Nala.
[04:55.320 --> 04:55.720]  Nala.
[04:56.840 --> 04:58.220]  What's the valuable ones?
[04:58.520 --> 04:58.720]  None.
[04:59.580 --> 05:00.320]  Rafiki Chaser.
[05:00.960 --> 05:01.400]  Rafiki...
[05:02.460 --> 05:03.160]  Rafiki Hollow.
[05:04.840 --> 05:05.680]  Rafiki Hollow.
[05:07.720 --> 05:09.100]  That's the mom, right?
[05:09.100 --> 05:09.340]  Yeah.
[05:10.560 --> 05:12.340]  Everybody likes these guys.
[05:12.720 --> 05:14.240]  Timon and Pumbalumba.
[05:14.940 --> 05:15.380]  Pumbalumba.
[05:15.380 --> 05:17.820]  The band is getting knocked down.
[05:18.040 --> 05:18.380]  Zazu.
[05:18.740 --> 05:19.860]  Oh, John Oliver.
[05:20.100 --> 05:20.300]  Damn.
[05:21.020 --> 05:21.380]  Simba.
[05:21.800 --> 05:22.080]  Okay.
[05:23.480 --> 05:23.840]  Scar.
[05:24.000 --> 05:24.540]  Young Simba.
[05:24.760 --> 05:25.520]  And Mufasa.
[05:25.640 --> 05:26.860]  Oh, my dick's wet.
[05:27.100 --> 05:27.660]  There you go.
[05:27.760 --> 05:28.140]  There you go.
[05:28.260 --> 05:28.580]  Mufasa.
[05:28.820 --> 05:30.260]  Those all go in the trash.
[05:30.720 --> 05:31.880]  He got his dick all wet.
[05:32.020 --> 05:32.960]  What do you do with all the additional cards?
[05:33.540 --> 05:35.780]  You have to not put more Lion King cards.
[05:36.020 --> 05:36.540]  Well, I'm not going to.
[05:36.640 --> 05:37.360]  We're going to put them right back in.
[05:37.480 --> 05:38.280]  We're going to put them right back in.
[05:38.760 --> 05:41.160]  Making the ratio of Lion King cards higher now.
[05:41.440 --> 05:41.880]  Oh, there you go.
[05:41.900 --> 05:42.960]  Thank you for grabbing something else, though.
[05:42.980 --> 05:43.380]  That was smart.
[05:43.640 --> 05:44.120]  And then what else?
[05:44.120 --> 05:45.180]  If it's Lion King again, we have to.
[05:45.580 --> 05:46.240]  Old-ass Top Stadium.
[05:46.360 --> 05:46.580]  Got it.
[05:46.680 --> 05:49.200]  Should I wash my hands before touching the fancy cards?
[05:49.380 --> 05:51.260]  No, because you're not going to be touching the fancy cards.
[05:51.280 --> 05:52.120]  Yeah, there's no fancy cards.
[05:52.840 --> 05:53.280]  All right.
[05:53.340 --> 05:55.180]  So, next, we're going to go with this pack of Tops.
[05:55.320 --> 05:55.520]  Cool.
[05:56.220 --> 05:57.220]  2020 Holiday Baseball.
[05:57.340 --> 05:58.460]  2020 Holiday Baseball.
[05:58.740 --> 05:59.360]  Two years ago.
[06:00.460 --> 06:05.080]  They have weird little, like, hats and, like, mistletoe and shit.
[06:05.220 --> 06:06.980]  It really is like fucking snowflakes on it.
[06:07.240 --> 06:08.500]  We got Christian Walker.
[06:08.640 --> 06:08.780]  Cool.
[06:09.820 --> 06:10.540]  Robinson Cano.
[06:10.580 --> 06:11.540]  They built that show here.
[06:11.780 --> 06:11.940]  Yeah.
[06:13.480 --> 06:14.340]  Christian Walker.
[06:14.340 --> 06:15.660]  Christian Walker, Texas Ranger.
[06:17.060 --> 06:18.680]  Supernatural guys are Walker, Texas Ranger.
[06:18.900 --> 06:19.080]  Wait.
[06:19.320 --> 06:20.940]  What team is Christian Walker on?
[06:21.000 --> 06:22.460]  He's on the New York Mets.
[06:22.520 --> 06:23.320]  That's Robinson Cano.
[06:23.420 --> 06:23.920]  So, no, he's not.
[06:24.000 --> 06:24.340]  Oh, wait.
[06:24.400 --> 06:25.060]  Who are you looking at?
[06:25.280 --> 06:26.420]  Christian Walker's on the A's.
[06:27.020 --> 06:27.980]  Arizona Diamondbacks.
[06:28.160 --> 06:28.880]  The A's.
[06:28.980 --> 06:29.380]  Arizona.
[06:29.660 --> 06:29.820]  You know.
[06:29.900 --> 06:30.180]  A, big A.
[06:30.460 --> 06:32.240]  The Oakland Arizona Diamondbacks.
[06:32.380 --> 06:33.700]  Tony Kemp is on the other A's.
[06:33.780 --> 06:33.920]  Yep.
[06:34.280 --> 06:36.040]  Then we got Joe Peterson.
[06:37.320 --> 06:38.740]  Chris for Sale.
[06:39.120 --> 06:39.460]  Nice.
[06:39.700 --> 06:40.760]  Chris for Sale.
[06:40.760 --> 06:42.600]  Oh, this one's a parallel.
[06:42.820 --> 06:43.060]  Okay.
[06:43.180 --> 06:44.220]  Edwin Rios, rookie.
[06:44.360 --> 06:45.460]  And you can feel the...
[06:45.460 --> 06:46.400]  Oh, you got a little...
[06:46.400 --> 06:46.960]  It's embossed.
[06:47.320 --> 06:47.720]  It's nice.
[06:48.320 --> 06:49.800]  Oh, it's an embossed snowflake.
[06:49.800 --> 06:50.220]  You can sleeve that.
[06:50.460 --> 06:50.840]  Oh, okay.
[06:51.160 --> 06:51.280]  Okay.
[06:51.480 --> 06:51.820]  That's fun.
[06:51.880 --> 06:52.260]  You get a good job.
[06:52.260 --> 06:52.440]  Oh, shit.
[06:52.580 --> 06:53.660]  Randy Rosarino, rookie.
[06:53.780 --> 06:54.360]  That's actually nice.
[06:54.360 --> 06:55.200]  That's actually probably decent.
[06:55.320 --> 06:56.420]  Sleeve that as well, please.
[06:57.280 --> 06:58.080]  Jose Barrios.
[06:58.220 --> 06:58.360]  Yep.
[06:58.620 --> 06:59.380]  Nick Castellanos.
[06:59.700 --> 06:59.980]  Oh.
[07:00.540 --> 07:02.000]  And Gregory Polanco.
[07:02.400 --> 07:02.540]  Yep.
[07:02.600 --> 07:05.940]  I think Nick Castellanos just came off of the I.L.
[07:06.080 --> 07:09.760]  Which is great, because he's going to hit a home run right as somebody apologizes for something
[07:11.420 --> 07:14.400]  Polanco sounds like in a procedural cop drama.
[07:14.620 --> 07:15.880]  He's like, the screw up.
[07:16.060 --> 07:16.580]  Oh, yeah.
[07:16.680 --> 07:17.040]  Polanco!
[07:17.300 --> 07:17.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:17.520 --> 07:18.040]  I can see that.
[07:18.140 --> 07:18.480]  God damn it.
[07:18.620 --> 07:19.260]  Classic Polanco.
[07:19.280 --> 07:19.980]  Where am I putting these here?
[07:20.200 --> 07:20.780]  Yeah, that's fine.
[07:20.840 --> 07:21.140]  That's good.
[07:21.260 --> 07:21.660]  Good job, Jack.
[07:21.680 --> 07:22.160]  Let's put them right here.
[07:22.380 --> 07:22.900]  Good job, man.
[07:23.300 --> 07:24.260]  You did a great job.
[07:24.280 --> 07:24.680]  Thank you.
[07:24.840 --> 07:25.800]  All right, we'll mix it up a little bit.
[07:25.920 --> 07:26.440]  We'll go...
[07:26.440 --> 07:26.640]  Here.
[07:26.900 --> 07:27.260]  Stadium.
[07:27.380 --> 07:32.020]  Way back in time to second series, 1991, top sliding.
[07:32.020 --> 07:32.260]  Were you in 1991?
[07:32.620 --> 07:33.000]  I was.
[07:33.040 --> 07:33.320]  Okay.
[07:33.880 --> 07:34.980]  I was in 10th grade.
[07:36.980 --> 07:38.440]  It's weird that you remember grades.
[07:38.740 --> 07:40.520]  You weren't like, I was X years old.
[07:40.680 --> 07:43.020]  It was like, I don't know what grade I was in in 91.
[07:43.620 --> 07:43.940]  You don't?
[07:44.020 --> 07:44.680]  I would have been 9.
[07:44.800 --> 07:46.440]  So whatever I was, I was 9.
[07:46.560 --> 07:48.280]  When I think of high school, high school is just grades to me.
[07:48.280 --> 07:48.620]  It's not really.
[07:48.880 --> 07:50.040]  Yeah, high school is grades, yeah.
[07:50.120 --> 07:50.920]  Yeah, just grades.
[07:51.260 --> 07:52.620]  I have no clue how old I was in it.
[07:52.740 --> 07:53.920]  I was 17 when I graduated.
[07:54.000 --> 07:54.420]  I remember that.
[07:56.680 --> 07:57.280]  Billy Spears.
[07:57.480 --> 07:57.740]  Okay.
[07:58.000 --> 07:58.560]  Billy Spears who?
[07:58.600 --> 08:01.240]  I was 17 when I graduated and I was already a soldier.
[08:02.740 --> 08:03.700]  Craig Wilson.
[08:04.780 --> 08:06.340]  Sign up for the military.
[08:06.720 --> 08:07.060]  Don't vote.
[08:08.440 --> 08:09.400]  Candy Maldonado.
[08:09.840 --> 08:11.240]  Don't buy anything legally yet.
[08:11.460 --> 08:12.280]  Lance Blakenship.
[08:12.860 --> 08:16.340]  These were shot on Kodak paper or something.
[08:16.340 --> 08:16.500]  Yeah.
[08:16.800 --> 08:17.640]  That's a big deal.
[08:18.280 --> 08:18.880]  Hubie Brooks.
[08:19.340 --> 08:19.480]  Okay.
[08:19.700 --> 08:19.880]  Hubie.
[08:20.780 --> 08:21.740]  Brian McRae.
[08:21.840 --> 08:21.960]  Okay.
[08:22.300 --> 08:25.100]  Ooh, look at this old ass photo of Tom Candiotti.
[08:25.300 --> 08:25.680]  There you go.
[08:25.940 --> 08:27.580]  That's 1991 my ass.
[08:27.680 --> 08:28.720]  That looks like about 1978.
[08:28.960 --> 08:29.380]  Yeah, no kidding.
[08:32.200 --> 08:32.920]  Wally Whitehurst.
[08:33.040 --> 08:33.220]  Okay.
[08:34.240 --> 08:34.600]  Michael...
[08:35.140 --> 08:35.840]  Come on, Geoffrey.
[08:36.140 --> 08:36.940]  Michael Kosta.
[08:38.660 --> 08:39.380]  Scott Erickson.
[08:41.520 --> 08:42.240]  Mark Gardner.
[08:42.500 --> 08:43.100]  A bunch of horror movies.
[08:43.320 --> 08:43.780]  Scott Erickson.
[08:44.100 --> 08:44.620]  Same one.
[08:45.380 --> 08:45.960]  Joe Bover.
[08:46.260 --> 08:47.700]  I don't think any of those cards were good.
[08:47.920 --> 08:49.340]  Not even fun to look at.
[08:49.340 --> 08:50.040]  Not even fun to look at.
[08:50.380 --> 08:52.940]  Just a pile of... that's why they were in the pack sack, I guess.
[08:53.280 --> 08:54.040]  But at least you can see them.
[08:54.360 --> 08:55.060]  At least now we know.
[08:56.480 --> 08:57.560]  Here's where we're going to do this.
[08:57.800 --> 08:59.880]  We're going to open this pack of Tom's Chrome.
[08:59.880 --> 09:00.640]  Want me to open it for you?
[09:01.200 --> 09:01.560]  Nope.
[09:01.960 --> 09:02.880]  Still don't need that.
[09:03.060 --> 09:03.200]  Nope.
[09:03.720 --> 09:04.880]  You are going to hurt yourself.
[09:05.060 --> 09:05.180]  Yep.
[09:05.620 --> 09:06.280]  And I won't feel bad.
[09:06.400 --> 09:07.220]  Or others.
[09:07.680 --> 09:08.120]  I'm going to hurt myself.
[09:08.780 --> 09:10.180]  The knife's facing away from me.
[09:10.320 --> 09:10.700]  I'm good.
[09:11.080 --> 09:12.320]  I'm probably the safest one here.
[09:12.680 --> 09:13.680]  When you're doing this...
[09:13.680 --> 09:14.580]  Everyone else is in danger.
[09:15.240 --> 09:17.180]  The cone of danger goes that direction.
[09:17.540 --> 09:18.600]  We got Byron Buxton.
[09:18.760 --> 09:19.080]  Nice.
[09:19.340 --> 09:21.620]  Buxton sounds like a bar you would drink at on 6th Street.
[09:21.740 --> 09:22.740]  You guys going to the Buxton tonight?
[09:22.820 --> 09:23.360]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:23.660 --> 09:24.300]  Maybe West 6th.
[09:24.300 --> 09:25.260]  I like Byron Buxton a lot.
[09:25.360 --> 09:25.700]  West 6th.
[09:25.700 --> 09:27.020]  He's a very good player.
[09:27.780 --> 09:28.420]  Maybe 4th.
[09:28.560 --> 09:28.640]  Shh.
[09:28.640 --> 09:29.560]  We're going to the Buxton tonight.
[09:31.060 --> 09:32.240]  You guys all got a message, huh?
[09:32.860 --> 09:33.500]  Bernie's fucking...
[09:33.500 --> 09:34.180]  Oh, got it.
[09:37.560 --> 09:38.200]  Shogo Akiyama.
[09:38.380 --> 09:38.620]  Uh-huh.
[09:39.220 --> 09:41.640]  Oh, here we got a rookie card for Tyler Stevenson.
[09:42.340 --> 09:42.640]  Okay.
[09:42.860 --> 09:43.380]  Got some bubble gum.
[09:43.380 --> 09:45.280]  Got a little bit of bubble gum while catching a fly ball.
[09:45.420 --> 09:46.300]  I feel like that's a...
[09:46.300 --> 09:47.420]  Popping a bubble and catching a pop fly.
[09:47.460 --> 09:47.940]  That's pretty cool.
[09:48.020 --> 09:48.600]  I like that one.
[09:48.700 --> 09:49.080]  I like that.
[09:49.180 --> 09:50.580]  I feel like that's a very fuck-based card.
[09:50.640 --> 09:53.440]  I think we should have, like, a food category.
[09:53.680 --> 09:54.020]  We should.
[09:54.100 --> 09:54.560]  You know what I mean?
[09:54.820 --> 09:58.500]  Well, you know, we talked about building a team that was all food-based, right?
[09:58.500 --> 10:00.620]  Like, Dwayne Bacon and, like, yeah.
[10:00.740 --> 10:01.500]  We should do that.
[10:02.060 --> 10:03.840]  William the Refrigerator Perry, because you got to keep your...
[10:03.840 --> 10:04.220]  That's a good one.
[10:04.320 --> 10:05.260]  You got to keep your food refrigerated.
[10:05.780 --> 10:07.680]  Here we have a parallel Pete Alonzo.
[10:07.960 --> 10:10.440]  What team would he be on, William the Refrigerator Perry?
[10:10.580 --> 10:11.480]  What team are we building?
[10:11.580 --> 10:12.600]  Is it a baseball team or a football team?
[10:13.340 --> 10:14.820]  Well, he would be on the Chicago Bears, right?
[10:15.980 --> 10:17.760]  I mean, if we're building a food team.
[10:18.180 --> 10:19.380]  He's a catcher.
[10:19.420 --> 10:19.940]  Oh, yeah.
[10:20.060 --> 10:23.060]  I don't know if it'd be cross sports or we'd do a food team for each sport.
[10:24.780 --> 10:25.840]  Well, I mean, it could be determined.
[10:25.940 --> 10:26.240]  I like it.
[10:26.240 --> 10:30.180]  When we get a fucking set and we're permanently in and this becomes a weekly show.
[10:30.300 --> 10:32.600]  This will become a weekly show for the most part.
[10:32.780 --> 10:33.780]  Except for when I go out of town.
[10:35.040 --> 10:37.540]  Send me a recurring invite and I'll be here for it.
[10:38.440 --> 10:40.740]  I'll send him a recurring invite and he won't even be here for it.
[10:41.200 --> 10:42.360]  I'll be here. He won't be here.
[10:42.780 --> 10:45.400]  There's a reason we almost canceled this five times.
[10:46.040 --> 10:47.600]  Can we do Tuesday? Can we do Wednesday?
[10:47.740 --> 10:48.300]  What about Friday?
[10:48.500 --> 10:49.200]  Okay, back to Wednesday.
[10:49.380 --> 10:51.280]  I was trying to accommodate other people's schedules.
[10:51.340 --> 10:52.280]  You should not have done that.
[10:52.540 --> 10:53.520]  Well, it didn't work anyway.
[10:53.860 --> 10:55.360]  You had to watch the monkey movie, right?
[10:55.360 --> 10:55.700]  So...
[10:57.300 --> 10:59.200]  Oh, Jack. Oh, Jack.
[11:00.380 --> 11:01.720]  I had intended...
[11:02.640 --> 11:05.580]  I had intended to bring a lot of these throughout all of them.
[11:05.660 --> 11:06.760]  But luckily, we pulled out one.
[11:07.080 --> 11:07.520]  Donruss.
[11:07.620 --> 11:08.920]  Donruss Americana 2009.
[11:09.560 --> 11:11.400]  Now, the chase cards we're going for here.
[11:11.520 --> 11:11.680]  Yeah.
[11:11.800 --> 11:14.780]  As always, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan Auto, Jackie Chan Relic.
[11:14.860 --> 11:16.300]  These are insane cards.
[11:17.220 --> 11:17.980]  You're not...
[11:17.980 --> 11:21.940]  If you would ask me what was in that pack and I was like, what's a valuable one?
[11:22.200 --> 11:24.020]  Jackie Chan would not have made that list.
[11:24.020 --> 11:25.660]  Jack, you're not ready for what is...
[11:26.100 --> 11:26.500]  Americana.
[11:26.820 --> 11:27.760]  This is an insane one.
[11:27.780 --> 11:29.100]  It's Guy Fieri in there.
[11:29.220 --> 11:30.420]  I wish... uh, maybe.
[11:30.680 --> 11:31.500]  I wish we had more.
[11:31.860 --> 11:32.480]  Uh-huh.
[11:32.840 --> 11:33.380]  That's not...
[11:33.380 --> 11:34.180]  It's just him some more.
[11:34.700 --> 11:35.660]  Just answer him.
[11:35.740 --> 11:35.960]  No.
[11:36.040 --> 11:36.860]  Put him on speakerphone.
[11:38.940 --> 11:39.980]  Return on this.
[11:40.060 --> 11:40.680]  It's like a...
[11:40.680 --> 11:41.860]  This is fucking bullshit content.
[11:41.860 --> 11:42.700]  This is how it comes back.
[11:42.740 --> 11:45.520]  As you tweeted about Harry Styles the other day, get one other friend.
[11:45.680 --> 11:45.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:46.300 --> 11:48.960]  It's anime dubs and fucking breakshit.
[11:49.100 --> 11:49.480]  That's it.
[11:50.600 --> 11:51.400]  Martin Sokoss.
[11:51.420 --> 11:51.700]  Okay.
[11:52.040 --> 11:52.680]  I don't know who that is.
[11:52.680 --> 11:53.300]  Obviously.
[11:53.700 --> 11:54.880]  Let's read about him.
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.480]  Geoff, you don't know about Martin Sokoss?
[11:56.640 --> 11:56.820]  Okay.
[11:57.040 --> 11:57.980]  When was he born?
[11:58.260 --> 12:00.520]  He was born in 1979.
[12:01.500 --> 12:01.920]  1966.
[12:02.300 --> 12:02.820]  Goddammit.
[12:02.920 --> 12:08.480]  Martin Sokoss played the elvish lord Celebron in Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring,
[12:08.600 --> 12:09.440]  and Return of the King.
[12:10.280 --> 12:15.400]  The Kingdom of Heaven actor also played one of the good guys alongside Charlize Theron
[12:15.400 --> 12:20.900]  in the futuristic sci-fi thriller Aeon Flux, which was a hunk of shit.
[12:21.020 --> 12:21.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:21.460 --> 12:22.460]  Aeon Flux?
[12:23.320 --> 12:24.240]  Not the way they did it.
[12:24.420 --> 12:25.140]  Did you mislead it?
[12:25.460 --> 12:26.360]  No, no.
[12:26.400 --> 12:27.620]  Oh, now this is a cool card.
[12:27.660 --> 12:27.900]  What do we got?
[12:27.980 --> 12:28.400]  What do we got?
[12:28.700 --> 12:29.140]  Americana.
[12:29.620 --> 12:31.020]  George A. Romero.
[12:31.020 --> 12:31.820]  All right.
[12:31.960 --> 12:34.540]  The man who gave us zombie.
[12:34.540 --> 12:35.200]  He's ready to get sleeved.
[12:35.200 --> 12:38.940]  We gotta give George Romero star of that Call of Duty zombie mode.
[12:38.940 --> 12:39.460]  That's right.
[12:39.800 --> 12:40.240]  He deserves.
[12:41.460 --> 12:43.780]  Star of the Call of Duty zombie mode.
[12:43.820 --> 12:44.080]  True.
[12:44.720 --> 12:45.060]  Oh, shit.
[12:45.100 --> 12:46.000]  He was in one, actually.
[12:46.120 --> 12:46.560]  Yeah.
[12:46.820 --> 12:47.340]  Keeps getting better.
[12:47.800 --> 12:48.640]  Tab Hunter.
[12:49.060 --> 12:49.500]  Oh!
[12:49.880 --> 12:51.880]  Talk about a blast from the...
[12:51.880 --> 12:54.300]  When was Tab Hunter born, Jack?
[12:54.380 --> 12:54.740]  1974.
[12:55.720 --> 12:56.080]  1978.
[12:56.700 --> 12:58.240]  So you guys don't know who Tab Hunter is?
[12:58.340 --> 12:59.020]  Absolutely not.
[12:59.180 --> 12:59.300]  No.
[12:59.480 --> 13:00.760]  He was born in 1931.
[13:01.200 --> 13:01.300]  What?
[13:01.720 --> 13:03.660]  He was a teen film idol.
[13:04.080 --> 13:05.920]  He was a teen idol in the 50s.
[13:06.000 --> 13:06.220]  Oh.
[13:06.360 --> 13:06.960]  That's how I remember.
[13:07.000 --> 13:07.660]  That's why you know him.
[13:08.520 --> 13:09.620]  Yeah, that's from back in my day.
[13:09.740 --> 13:10.840]  You guys don't know who Tab Hunter is?
[13:11.000 --> 13:11.480]  Just guess.
[13:11.720 --> 13:13.900]  So you guys don't have any fucking clue about what I'm asking you.
[13:13.920 --> 13:15.420]  He was in Damn Yankees.
[13:15.440 --> 13:16.780]  I mean, if you looked at that picture...
[13:16.780 --> 13:17.000]  Yeah, look at it.
[13:17.180 --> 13:18.780]  I just caught a little bit of flannel.
[13:18.780 --> 13:19.600]  Yeah, that's bullshit.
[13:19.600 --> 13:20.760]  That looks like he could have been on a CW show.
[13:20.760 --> 13:21.300]  That is like...
[13:21.300 --> 13:21.800]  A hundred percent.
[13:22.100 --> 13:28.980]  Dude, that is 1950s white guy hair, 1950s white guy attire, and 1950s white guy...
[13:29.040 --> 13:31.100]  That's 2000s country fans.
[13:31.120 --> 13:32.000]  Like, that's all it is.
[13:32.020 --> 13:33.840]  I know six guys who look like him.
[13:34.340 --> 13:35.980]  Now that did not air that clean cut.
[13:36.160 --> 13:36.780]  I'm sorry.
[13:36.900 --> 13:37.180]  You don't.
[13:37.280 --> 13:38.200]  They might have the belt on.
[13:38.700 --> 13:38.980]  Man.
[13:39.400 --> 13:40.220]  That's going in the trash.
[13:40.660 --> 13:41.760]  It's not going in the trash.
[13:42.240 --> 13:43.120]  It's going in the...
[13:43.120 --> 13:45.000]  I'll figure out how to use this cleverly down the road.
[13:45.020 --> 13:45.620]  Do you have a shredder noise?
[13:45.720 --> 13:45.800]  Yeah.
[13:46.660 --> 13:49.380]  Marisol Nichols, who we all remember from.
[13:49.840 --> 13:50.360]  Marissa Nichols.
[13:50.840 --> 13:50.860]  Vegas.
[13:51.640 --> 13:52.580]  That show Las Vegas.
[13:52.620 --> 13:54.480]  She was in Nashville.
[13:54.960 --> 13:55.160]  Oh.
[13:55.380 --> 13:56.940]  The TVU show with Hayden Panettiere.
[13:58.680 --> 14:03.900]  Marisol Nichols has twice been nominated for an American Latino Media Arts Award for her
[14:03.900 --> 14:06.880]  role as Special Agent Nadia Rasier...
[14:06.880 --> 14:07.240]  In Nashville.
[14:07.360 --> 14:09.500]  ...an Arab American character on 24.
[14:09.500 --> 14:14.880]  She was also nominated for playing Maryam Al Khalifa, an Arab princess in The Princess
[14:14.880 --> 14:16.860]  and the Marine in 2007.
[14:17.040 --> 14:20.980]  The Felon star was named Top Bombshell by Vibe Magazine.
[14:21.420 --> 14:21.780]  Oh.
[14:22.060 --> 14:23.240]  Well, that was my next guess.
[14:23.880 --> 14:24.960]  I've seen some of those things.
[14:25.440 --> 14:25.760]  Marisol Nichols.
[14:25.760 --> 14:26.520]  I watched 24.
[14:27.040 --> 14:27.520]  Was she in Las Vegas?
[14:27.520 --> 14:27.640]  Marisol.
[14:28.000 --> 14:28.700]  Her name is not Marisa.
[14:28.780 --> 14:31.280]  No, that was just me saying the words Las Vegas a couple of times.
[14:31.380 --> 14:31.980]  That's why you thought that.
[14:31.980 --> 14:32.780]  That was a great show.
[14:32.940 --> 14:34.440]  I don't know about that, but I agree.
[14:36.200 --> 14:38.020]  I'm going to go ahead and get a sleeve ready for this.
[14:38.020 --> 14:38.420]  Here we go.
[14:38.420 --> 14:39.360]  I'm definitely sleeving this.
[14:41.180 --> 14:42.560]  America's favorite whacker.
[14:42.780 --> 14:42.920]  Okay.
[14:43.060 --> 14:43.360]  What?
[14:43.660 --> 14:44.540]  Fred Willard.
[14:44.640 --> 14:44.920]  Yeah!
[14:45.940 --> 14:46.920]  What happened?
[14:47.160 --> 14:48.180]  I mean, what happened?
[14:49.040 --> 14:49.740]  What happened?
[14:49.960 --> 14:50.320]  Oh, no.
[14:51.580 --> 14:58.960]  If you haven't seen A Mighty Wind, you probably haven't, but he was particularly great in
[14:58.960 --> 14:59.400]  A Mighty Wind.
[14:59.500 --> 15:04.560]  He has one sketch that he's in, in I Think You Should Leave, where he's playing this
[15:04.560 --> 15:06.700]  organ that's all these noises and shit.
[15:07.060 --> 15:08.240]  It's so fucking funny.
[15:08.240 --> 15:10.940]  There's just something about his physical comedy that was so good.
[15:11.000 --> 15:11.640]  He's the best.
[15:11.960 --> 15:12.480]  Absolutely the best.
[15:12.480 --> 15:15.800]  And then he went to the porn theater, and it's like, well, what the fuck else do you
[15:15.800 --> 15:15.980]  think?
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.060]  He doesn't know what the internet is.
[15:17.140 --> 15:17.300]  Yeah.
[15:17.440 --> 15:18.380]  He's 100 years old.
[15:18.540 --> 15:21.600]  When you're that old, you jack off in movie theaters.
[15:21.760 --> 15:25.980]  But then he went on Letterman or someone, and it was like, eh, I messed up.
[15:26.220 --> 15:27.160]  And it was like, whatever.
[15:27.360 --> 15:27.640]  Yeah, of course.
[15:27.920 --> 15:29.520]  It's like, hey, here's the deal.
[15:29.560 --> 15:32.480]  If Hugh Grant could go and say, hey, I messed up, Fred Willard's fine.
[15:32.520 --> 15:33.180]  Here's the deal.
[15:33.960 --> 15:35.160]  The harsh reality.
[15:36.800 --> 15:39.060]  Almost half of the people on Earth have penises.
[15:39.820 --> 15:42.340]  And if you've got one, chances are you've touched it.
[15:43.900 --> 15:45.440]  But just don't go into one of those movie theaters.
[15:45.460 --> 15:47.520]  Just don't go into a movie theater, unless you're old as dirt.
[15:47.780 --> 15:52.200]  And I imagine he was only in that movie theater with other old-ass dudes, because that's how
[15:52.200 --> 15:53.360]  you jacked off in the 40s.
[15:53.400 --> 15:54.720]  Did he die last year or the year before?
[15:54.800 --> 15:56.620]  I think he died the year before, I guess, or a couple of years.
[15:56.700 --> 15:56.920]  Really?
[15:57.060 --> 15:58.100]  I thought it was like five years ago.
[15:58.260 --> 16:00.000]  Should we get into some of your cheap-ass gamer friends, folks?
[16:00.000 --> 16:00.560]  Yeah, let's do it.
[16:00.560 --> 16:03.340]  My friend Jared, who runs Cheap-Ass Gamer, sent us some cards.
[16:04.220 --> 16:05.440]  He died in 2020, I was right.
[16:06.120 --> 16:06.620]  Not Jared!
[16:06.900 --> 16:07.460]  Two years ago?
[16:07.720 --> 16:08.300]  No, Jared's still going.
[16:08.580 --> 16:09.400]  Fred Willard was two? I could have sworn.
[16:09.400 --> 16:10.380]  No, just 2020.
[16:10.860 --> 16:13.020]  So Cheap-Ass Gamer is where you can get video game deals.
[16:13.100 --> 16:17.100]  My friend Jared found these cards, and he said, hey man, you want some cards for your show?
[16:17.340 --> 16:19.400]  And then he messaged me, he's like, hey man, you gonna open those cards?
[16:20.020 --> 16:20.840]  Here's what we're gonna do.
[16:20.900 --> 16:23.100]  Is Shipwreck from Cheap-Ass Gamer, or is that somebody else?
[16:23.120 --> 16:23.860]  I don't know what Shipwreck is.
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.360]  He was like, yes? Called it.
[16:26.900 --> 16:28.280]  That wasn't Jared, that was Brian.
[16:29.120 --> 16:30.200]  Who's also still alive.
[16:31.440 --> 16:32.100]  Oh no.
[16:33.780 --> 16:37.340]  Because we have to feed the PAX app, I'm gonna put Johnny Quest in the PAX app.
[16:37.380 --> 16:38.280]  Okay, I think that's fair.
[16:38.300 --> 16:40.680]  I'm sorry, Geoff, Beto O'Rourke is texting me right now.
[16:40.920 --> 16:43.840]  Get one other friend better.
[16:45.400 --> 16:46.600]  Okay, let's get into it.
[16:46.640 --> 16:48.300]  I don't want to do Equestrian yet, I kind of want to hold that.
[16:48.360 --> 16:48.720]  We'll do Batman.
[16:49.140 --> 16:49.500]  Batman.
[16:49.780 --> 16:50.860]  It is 89 Batman?
[16:51.140 --> 16:52.380]  Yeah, this is where...
[16:52.380 --> 16:55.100]  Let me tell you a funny story about the Batman, this movie.
[16:55.320 --> 16:56.300]  The Batman or Batman?
[16:56.300 --> 16:57.140]  The Batman or that Batman?
[16:57.160 --> 16:57.440]  Batman.
[16:57.600 --> 16:58.520]  Okay, thank you.
[16:58.520 --> 17:01.600]  This movie, the 1989 film starring Michael Keaton.
[17:01.780 --> 17:01.980]  Got it.
[17:02.260 --> 17:04.880]  This movie came out on my birthday, June 19th, 1921.
[17:05.140 --> 17:06.560]  I was in 10th grade, we established that.
[17:07.280 --> 17:09.380]  I went to see it in the theater.
[17:10.160 --> 17:13.500]  And while I was in the theater, there was a shootout in the parking lot.
[17:13.680 --> 17:14.520]  Holy shit.
[17:14.780 --> 17:16.620]  Because Boys in the Hood was also premiering that weekend.
[17:16.780 --> 17:17.060]  Wow.
[17:17.440 --> 17:19.700]  And there was some sort of a gang fight in the parking lot.
[17:19.780 --> 17:21.020]  And I had no idea.
[17:21.160 --> 17:23.780]  I came outside after watching Batman and there were like cops around and shit.
[17:23.860 --> 17:24.420]  And I was like, whoa.
[17:24.540 --> 17:26.020]  Whoa, this looks like a job for the Batman.
[17:26.020 --> 17:28.220]  Well, Batman, I hate Batman.
[17:28.240 --> 17:29.120]  No, no, no, I hate Batman.
[17:29.140 --> 17:30.660]  Michael Keaton would show up and he'd wreck house.
[17:31.120 --> 17:32.620]  Pattinson would just get there and brood.
[17:33.500 --> 17:34.460]  I forgot about Pattinson.
[17:35.820 --> 17:36.320]  There we go.
[17:36.400 --> 17:37.260]  We got that scene.
[17:37.400 --> 17:38.200]  I think we all remember.
[17:38.580 --> 17:39.820]  Oh, that's like the beginning of the movie, isn't it?
[17:39.860 --> 17:40.800]  Yeah, it was at Christmas.
[17:41.580 --> 17:42.640]  And it was like a radio show.
[17:42.760 --> 17:44.180]  Wait, wait, wait.
[17:44.400 --> 17:45.620]  I thought Christmas was Batman 2.
[17:46.520 --> 17:47.560]  Yeah, this is the second one.
[17:47.720 --> 17:48.840]  This is Batman Returns.
[17:48.840 --> 17:51.680]  I couldn't see Batman Returns as hidden by the $3 mark.
[17:52.040 --> 17:55.180]  Because I was about to say, things were about to get real weird with Danny DeVito right there.
[17:56.220 --> 17:57.540]  Oh, that's interesting.
[17:57.820 --> 17:59.480]  I don't know which one is the parallel.
[17:59.820 --> 18:03.040]  So there's a Danny DeVito followed up by the exact same Danny DeVito.
[18:03.120 --> 18:04.260]  Whoa, we got double DeVito.
[18:04.860 --> 18:05.640]  Double D's.
[18:06.040 --> 18:06.820]  Nope, neither of them are parallel.
[18:07.140 --> 18:11.100]  Double D's.
[18:12.020 --> 18:13.740]  Where's Gavin to glue these together?
[18:14.760 --> 18:17.660]  Here, sleeve these together as double D's back to back like that.
[18:17.980 --> 18:20.040]  Oh, here we have the Batman.
[18:20.400 --> 18:21.540]  Oh, it's the Batman.
[18:22.260 --> 18:26.680]  And then we have... I don't remember this scene.
[18:26.780 --> 18:26.940]  Okay.
[18:27.240 --> 18:28.540]  But there's Michelle Pfeiffer.
[18:29.180 --> 18:29.860]  She's being a cat.
[18:30.100 --> 18:32.040]  And some dude.
[18:32.280 --> 18:32.480]  Meanwhile.
[18:32.480 --> 18:33.640]  Is that Max Schreck?
[18:33.860 --> 18:35.080]  It looks kind of like...
[18:35.080 --> 18:38.220]  It looks like... what's his name? The guitar player, Jack White.
[18:38.820 --> 18:40.660]  It's Jack White with Michelle Pfeiffer.
[18:40.740 --> 18:44.120]  I was thinking it looked a little bit like... what's his face from Clockwork Orange?
[18:45.240 --> 18:46.220]  Oh, also a good guess.
[18:46.980 --> 18:47.620]  I can't think of his name.
[18:48.340 --> 18:49.140]  Malcolm McDowell.
[18:49.140 --> 18:51.400]  Oh, here we got another DeVito.
[18:51.800 --> 18:52.860]  The Penguin.
[18:53.540 --> 18:54.300]  Oswald Copperpot.
[18:54.360 --> 18:56.700]  Remember when he just gnawed on that fish?
[18:57.800 --> 19:00.120]  That movie scared the shit out of me when I was a kid.
[19:00.560 --> 19:02.140]  Christopher Walken was fantastic in it.
[19:02.400 --> 19:03.300]  Do we get a Christopher Walken?
[19:03.540 --> 19:05.160]  We got another whatever that is.
[19:06.120 --> 19:08.160]  Oh, check this out.
[19:08.700 --> 19:10.980]  This is dudes on a bridge.
[19:11.480 --> 19:13.200]  They're pointing that they're making fun of the penguin.
[19:13.380 --> 19:14.060]  They're laughing at him.
[19:14.100 --> 19:14.440]  Don't bully.
[19:15.020 --> 19:15.720]  It's 2022.
[19:15.880 --> 19:16.740]  Yeah, they become the penguin.
[19:16.940 --> 19:17.520]  It's 2022, right?
[19:18.120 --> 19:18.840]  Don't bully.
[19:19.380 --> 19:19.900]  Not Penguin People.
[19:19.900 --> 19:20.260]  Don't do that.
[19:20.440 --> 19:20.880]  That's not cool.
[19:22.720 --> 19:23.580]  Oh, here we go.
[19:24.200 --> 19:27.760]  A very dark card of Michelle Pfeiffer and the Batman.
[19:27.920 --> 19:29.060]  I'm gonna say these cards suck.
[19:29.160 --> 19:33.380]  Million dollars, but you have to have one three-fingered hand the rest of your life.
[19:33.400 --> 19:34.900]  We can't afford to make that show anymore, man.
[19:35.040 --> 19:35.200]  Yeah.
[19:39.100 --> 19:41.080]  Yeah, no, I would do it for more than that.
[19:41.200 --> 19:42.300]  A million bucks a finger, maybe.
[19:43.380 --> 19:45.300]  It's really just ceiling to two million.
[19:45.300 --> 19:45.700]  Yeah.
[19:45.760 --> 19:49.460]  So you do the floppy hand with three fingers?
[19:49.460 --> 19:51.780]  We can't afford to make that show anymore.
[19:51.980 --> 19:52.260]  Yeah.
[19:52.900 --> 19:53.940]  That's why we're doing this.
[19:53.960 --> 19:55.720]  There's tape on this goddamn mat, of course.
[19:55.920 --> 19:56.420]  There's another...
[19:56.420 --> 19:58.180]  What budget do you think we're dealing with here?
[19:58.200 --> 19:59.620]  Classic moment from the movie.
[19:59.820 --> 20:00.800]  That's, uh...
[20:00.800 --> 20:01.440]  These cards suck.
[20:02.180 --> 20:03.380]  Can you imagine being...
[20:03.380 --> 20:06.700]  I mean, I didn't buy these in high school because I was buying comic books.
[20:07.180 --> 20:10.160]  But I was going straight to the source for this bullshit.
[20:11.160 --> 20:13.080]  But can you imagine if you bought these and you were like...
[20:13.080 --> 20:13.560]  I'd be curious.
[20:13.560 --> 20:14.720]  You'd be like, why the fuck...
[20:15.100 --> 20:16.660]  Is that two cards you just picked up?
[20:16.700 --> 20:17.820]  Or are these cards just super fat?
[20:18.000 --> 20:18.780]  They're super...
[20:18.780 --> 20:20.060]  Yeah, they're super two cards.
[20:20.140 --> 20:21.380]  It's the same fucking card again.
[20:21.500 --> 20:21.600]  Yeah.
[20:22.020 --> 20:24.600]  I think we got that Batman one earlier, too.
[20:24.700 --> 20:25.720]  Yeah, a cardigan one is a sweater.
[20:25.840 --> 20:26.440]  The collation is...
[20:26.440 --> 20:27.120]  Oh, here's a...
[20:27.120 --> 20:27.640]  Okay, what do we got?
[20:27.840 --> 20:30.280]  It's Michelle Pfeiffer in her window in Amsterdam.
[20:31.220 --> 20:32.120]  Red light's on!
[20:32.460 --> 20:33.380]  No, that's her apartment.
[20:33.740 --> 20:34.220]  I don't know.
[20:34.960 --> 20:35.520]  And then, uh...
[20:35.520 --> 20:36.600]  Gotham City, Geoff.
[20:36.740 --> 20:37.320]  You know comics.
[20:37.640 --> 20:38.440]  These should go to trash.
[20:38.700 --> 20:39.280]  This is...
[20:39.280 --> 20:40.080]  Put all these in the trash.
[20:40.820 --> 20:43.700]  I think this is literally a penguin falling through a skylight.
[20:43.740 --> 20:44.080]  Okay.
[20:44.120 --> 20:44.920]  I want that card.
[20:45.500 --> 20:45.920]  That's it.
[20:46.060 --> 20:46.680]  We just leave it for you?
[20:46.740 --> 20:47.300]  That's all you, man.
[20:47.660 --> 20:48.440]  You keep that.
[20:48.600 --> 20:49.600]  Yeah, will you just leave that for me, bud?
[20:49.600 --> 20:50.000]  Thank you.
[20:50.060 --> 20:50.740]  I appreciate it.
[20:51.400 --> 20:52.080]  This is...
[20:52.080 --> 20:53.300]  It's just a penguin falling out of a...
[20:53.300 --> 20:54.520]  You can take that into a dark theater with you.
[20:54.640 --> 20:55.340]  I think it...
[20:55.340 --> 20:56.880]  Is it the penguin or a penguin?
[20:57.500 --> 20:58.060]  What happened?
[21:00.260 --> 21:02.340]  Next up, we're gonna open up everybody's favorite...
[21:02.340 --> 21:02.560]  Oh, Bingo!
[21:03.180 --> 21:03.520]  Bingo!
[21:07.580 --> 21:08.260]  Was Bingo...
[21:08.260 --> 21:09.500]  Was his dad a...
[21:09.500 --> 21:10.500]  What was his name-o?
[21:12.160 --> 21:14.360]  The kid from Bingo, the father was...
[21:14.360 --> 21:17.640]  Wasn't he a kicker for the Jets and he got traded?
[21:18.920 --> 21:20.120]  In the movie or in real life?
[21:20.200 --> 21:20.780]  In the movie.
[21:20.880 --> 21:22.560]  Like, he was a place kicker and he got traded.
[21:22.800 --> 21:25.920]  And Bingo ran away and they had to move and Bingo had to find...
[21:25.920 --> 21:26.520]  I don't know, but there's a...
[21:26.520 --> 21:27.000]  Is that what it's about?
[21:27.020 --> 21:28.320]  I'm pretty sure that's what it's...
[21:28.320 --> 21:29.060]  I could be wrong.
[21:29.140 --> 21:30.220]  That might be a different dog movie.
[21:30.220 --> 21:31.400]  Kid without a shirt on.
[21:32.160 --> 21:33.140]  You want me to leave that for you, Geoff?
[21:33.220 --> 21:33.500]  No.
[21:34.080 --> 21:35.160]  We'll give that to Erickson.
[21:36.120 --> 21:37.140]  Keep it with his own penguin collection.
[21:37.520 --> 21:38.800]  Penguin falling through the skylight.
[21:38.800 --> 21:40.780]  Oh, world famous Hollywood poodles.
[21:41.040 --> 21:41.400]  Aw.
[21:43.580 --> 21:44.560]  What do we got?
[21:44.920 --> 21:46.440]  Oh, dude, these get so good.
[21:46.500 --> 21:46.680]  What?
[21:46.860 --> 21:47.840]  Oh, you're putting them in the bag?
[21:48.040 --> 21:48.420]  Oh, wow.
[21:48.620 --> 21:51.880]  Here we got Sinner Ring at the Cirque du Soleil.
[21:52.940 --> 21:56.000]  Then we got Ring of Fire at the Cirque du Soleil.
[21:56.260 --> 21:59.800]  I have vague memories of this and being fucked up about the circus.
[21:59.960 --> 22:01.020]  That's in front of Caesar's Palace.
[22:01.160 --> 22:02.520]  They have that weird show, you know?
[22:02.720 --> 22:04.600]  Oh, it's Absinthe.
[22:05.240 --> 22:05.920]  It's pretty good.
[22:06.140 --> 22:06.660]  It's pretty good.
[22:06.740 --> 22:07.920]  The dog jumped through a fire.
[22:07.920 --> 22:10.100]  I don't remember there being a dog in Absinthe, but they refreshed the cast.
[22:10.400 --> 22:13.040]  Brent, can you look up and tell me if that's the right plot of the movie?
[22:13.140 --> 22:15.440]  That the dad got traded for a different team?
[22:15.440 --> 22:16.340]  Traded from the Jets?
[22:16.440 --> 22:17.020]  I think so.
[22:17.100 --> 22:19.940]  I want to say, like, move from New York to, like, Green Bay or something.
[22:20.080 --> 22:22.540]  Alright, we're gonna go in order of how fucking cool these cards are.
[22:23.260 --> 22:27.320]  Alright, here's the little, it's like a, I guess, Tarzan boy?
[22:27.580 --> 22:30.440]  Like, living in the jungle, and he meets Bingo, and he's like, thank you, fella.
[22:30.860 --> 22:31.420]  Yes, Tarzan boy.
[22:31.420 --> 22:33.880]  So I guess he still speaks English, even though he's been living in the jungle his whole life.
[22:33.900 --> 22:34.760]  Why is he choking that dog?
[22:35.460 --> 22:36.020]  Here's the...
[22:36.020 --> 22:36.320]  Get him!
[22:37.020 --> 22:38.620]  Here's the, uh...
[22:38.620 --> 22:39.380]  This is a really sad one.
[22:39.520 --> 22:40.100]  Oh no!
[22:40.500 --> 22:42.160]  Is this a thanks fetish underneath it?
[22:42.260 --> 22:43.080]  Yeah, he says thanks fetish.
[22:43.240 --> 22:43.480]  Okay.
[22:44.660 --> 22:45.020]  Uh...
[22:45.020 --> 22:45.680]  Bingo can't do it.
[22:46.340 --> 22:46.700]  No!
[22:48.060 --> 22:48.820]  Bingo can't do it.
[22:48.860 --> 22:49.440]  Bingo's scared.
[22:49.780 --> 22:50.140]  No, Bingo!
[22:50.300 --> 22:50.780]  Bingo can't do it.
[22:50.780 --> 22:51.780]  I'll just leave this one for you.
[22:52.220 --> 22:53.860]  Um, and then it's gonna get sad again.
[22:54.300 --> 22:58.320]  Bingo is a runaway circus dog who escapes the Big Top, saves the life of Chucky,
[22:58.480 --> 23:00.400]  a young boy who has trouble fitting in with his pals.
[23:00.780 --> 23:01.540]  Because he lives in the woods!
[23:01.720 --> 23:02.740]  That's, yeah, okay.
[23:02.840 --> 23:03.400]  His pals are creatures.
[23:03.400 --> 23:08.960]  What's the movie with the dog that gets away, but the family's moving and the dog, like,
[23:09.060 --> 23:09.840]  chases him across country?
[23:09.860 --> 23:10.420]  Homeward Bound.
[23:11.040 --> 23:11.500]  No.
[23:11.700 --> 23:12.320]  Milo and Otis.
[23:12.640 --> 23:13.120]  No.
[23:13.380 --> 23:13.940]  Homeward Bound.
[23:14.020 --> 23:16.280]  It killed so many dogs and cats in Milo and Otis.
[23:16.680 --> 23:17.720]  Yeah, they were just throwing them off cliffs.
[23:17.960 --> 23:18.100]  Yeah.
[23:19.740 --> 23:20.220]  Uh...
[23:21.220 --> 23:21.700]  Uh...
[23:22.180 --> 23:23.520]  What the fuck?
[23:24.240 --> 23:25.940]  Bingo misses his family.
[23:26.760 --> 23:27.720]  That's so sad.
[23:28.260 --> 23:29.580]  But allow me to...
[23:29.580 --> 23:29.880]  Uh-oh.
[23:29.980 --> 23:30.660]  Lift your spirits.
[23:30.660 --> 23:34.840]  Howell tells them to go upstairs and start packing as he has been traded to another team,
[23:35.160 --> 23:36.580]  the Green Bay Packers!
[23:36.800 --> 23:37.340]  You were close.
[23:37.540 --> 23:39.240]  I know, I said it was like New York to Green Bay.
[23:39.540 --> 23:40.460]  He gets traded.
[23:40.740 --> 23:41.140]  Wow.
[23:41.400 --> 23:42.060]  So that was Bingo.
[23:42.340 --> 23:42.600]  Yeah.
[23:42.700 --> 23:42.940]  All right!
[23:42.940 --> 23:44.660]  And then Bingo starts going.
[23:44.760 --> 23:45.080]  Yeah, okay.
[23:45.200 --> 23:46.700]  So that's when he misses his family.
[23:47.220 --> 23:49.380]  Bingo is jailed for contempt of court.
[23:51.020 --> 23:51.560]  This is...
[23:51.560 --> 23:54.820]  If you read just sentences from this movie, it's the greatest thing I've ever seen.
[23:55.920 --> 23:56.580]  Be prepared.
[23:56.680 --> 23:58.180]  We just had two sad Bingos in a row.
[23:58.360 --> 23:58.440]  Okay.
[23:58.440 --> 24:03.400]  Be prepared for three Bingo cards to lift your spirits in an escalating manner.
[24:03.780 --> 24:05.420]  Starting off with...
[24:05.420 --> 24:08.060]  Bingo is ready for the road!
[24:08.500 --> 24:09.980]  He's got his little backpack on.
[24:10.060 --> 24:10.780]  He's got his glasses.
[24:10.960 --> 24:11.600]  He's got his pink hat.
[24:11.620 --> 24:11.960]  Yeah, Bingo!
[24:12.380 --> 24:13.520]  He is happy as can be.
[24:14.440 --> 24:21.620]  And he decided, why am I running around on my dog paws on the hot ground when I could be on a skateboard?
[24:21.740 --> 24:22.060]  Whoa!
[24:22.060 --> 24:22.660]  Bingo!
[24:24.740 --> 24:29.520]  And then after all that excitement, Bingo likes to chill out at the beach.
[24:29.860 --> 24:31.120]  Beach Blanket Bingo.
[24:31.680 --> 24:32.780]  Beach Blanket Bingo!
[24:33.800 --> 24:36.340]  I'm going to say we sleeve all three of those.
[24:36.380 --> 24:37.540]  Sleeve them in one sleeve, though.
[24:38.920 --> 24:40.320]  Those are some uplifting cards.
[24:40.320 --> 24:40.620]  I'll do some.
[24:40.740 --> 24:43.020]  I want to be able to see skateboarding Bingo.
[24:43.880 --> 24:45.700]  I think next we're going to go with skateboarding.
[24:45.720 --> 24:46.400]  These have been good, Jared.
[24:46.400 --> 24:47.540]  Thank you, Jared.
[24:47.540 --> 24:48.560]  We got skateboarding right here.
[24:48.720 --> 24:49.400]  Super heat.
[24:49.980 --> 24:50.540]  We do.
[24:50.540 --> 24:52.460]  Let me know if Bingo's on any of those.
[24:52.520 --> 24:54.300]  Let me get a Bingo rookie card here.
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.680]  Bingo Auto on card.
[24:59.820 --> 25:01.120]  He's licked all of these.
[25:02.720 --> 25:07.980]  I want to say the father for Bingo was that character actor who was in everything.
[25:08.060 --> 25:11.260]  Yeah, I saw him when I made the search and I went, oh, that fucking guy.
[25:11.480 --> 25:12.500]  Yeah, he was in everything.
[25:12.760 --> 25:14.420]  He was like a Porter Man's John Ritter.
[25:15.920 --> 25:17.820]  Seems to be some sort of a game.
[25:17.980 --> 25:18.200]  Okay.
[25:18.200 --> 25:23.860]  You get 70 points if you do a Luis Lopez Jr. nollie heel flip.
[25:23.860 --> 25:25.260]  These cards just go through them fast.
[25:25.760 --> 25:27.600]  There was a time in my life when I could do a nollie heel flip.
[25:27.900 --> 25:28.000]  Really?
[25:28.360 --> 25:30.180]  Not very high or not very well, but I could.
[25:30.640 --> 25:35.100]  I've never in my life been able to do a Japan 540 like Bob Burnquist there.
[25:35.120 --> 25:37.520]  No, Burnquist hitting it is fucking sick.
[25:37.600 --> 25:38.660]  Guy Mariano doing a nollie.
[25:38.740 --> 25:38.980]  Okay.
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.160]  Made it look a lot cooler than I ever did.
[25:41.680 --> 25:44.560]  Steven Stenham doing a frontside hand plant.
[25:44.740 --> 25:46.100]  That's an old timey trick.
[25:47.060 --> 25:48.040]  What do we got here?
[25:49.060 --> 25:51.580]  Greg Lutz got a frontside kickflip.
[25:51.800 --> 25:51.960]  Okay.
[25:52.740 --> 25:53.440]  Ooh, here we go.
[25:53.560 --> 25:56.680]  Backside tweak air by Christian Hosoi.
[25:57.580 --> 26:01.180]  Christian Hosoi, I think, went super religious, didn't he, I believe?
[26:01.340 --> 26:03.560]  I think maybe you're just looking at his first name and thinking...
[26:03.560 --> 26:04.920]  No, no, no, I grew up with Christian Hosoi.
[26:05.040 --> 26:06.200]  I believe he was like...
[26:06.200 --> 26:09.280]  I remember he had cool shirts and cool decks.
[26:09.420 --> 26:11.520]  Yeah, he skated a Vision Gator, I think.
[26:12.580 --> 26:14.280]  Then we have... ooh, here we go.
[26:14.980 --> 26:16.720]  Superheat Pro Card, Guy Mariano.
[26:16.940 --> 26:17.200]  Okay.
[26:17.460 --> 26:19.300]  There you go, it's like his driver's license.
[26:20.340 --> 26:21.280]  Then we got...
[26:23.480 --> 26:26.660]  You may choose one of your back... oh, this is for the game.
[26:27.960 --> 26:30.100]  Backside 180 for Lizard.
[26:30.600 --> 26:31.740]  Let's go, Lizard!
[26:31.880 --> 26:33.480]  You're familiar with who Lizard is.
[26:33.860 --> 26:35.880]  And then, because we can't get enough of Guy Mariano...
[26:35.880 --> 26:36.700]  Jesus Christ!
[26:36.920 --> 26:38.420]  Here's a switch crooked grind.
[26:38.840 --> 26:39.500]  That's cool, though.
[26:39.620 --> 26:40.080]  That is cool.
[26:40.420 --> 26:42.680]  Look at the... it's got like a little background to it.
[26:42.760 --> 26:43.480]  That's kind of cool, that embossing.
[26:43.820 --> 26:45.900]  It's got some skulls and crossbones.
[26:46.040 --> 26:46.240]  Neat!
[26:46.580 --> 26:48.200]  The crossbones are skateboards.
[26:48.360 --> 26:51.920]  You know, I like that Jared took a swing with some of these cards.
[26:52.200 --> 26:53.720]  Bingo cards, great, wouldn't have thought that.
[26:53.820 --> 26:55.080]  Skating cards, I would have thought were great.
[26:55.220 --> 26:55.500]  We're not.
[26:57.260 --> 26:57.940]  Now here...
[26:58.360 --> 27:00.340]  Now here we have something very special.
[27:00.840 --> 27:01.720]  Equestrian collector card.
[27:01.740 --> 27:02.660]  This I'm very excited about.
[27:02.720 --> 27:06.540]  I don't know if you guys know this, but I'm big into the horse racing.
[27:06.700 --> 27:08.340]  You're big into the horse racing?
[27:08.380 --> 27:09.140]  Big into the horse racing.
[27:09.260 --> 27:10.140]  I like to go to Vegas.
[27:10.140 --> 27:15.160]  My girlfriend and I, we like to plop down at the sports book in the wind.
[27:15.160 --> 27:16.140]  You think these are horse racing cards?
[27:16.280 --> 27:17.460]  And then we...
[27:17.460 --> 27:18.360]  Well, they go fast.
[27:18.400 --> 27:19.160]  Then we watch horses.
[27:19.260 --> 27:21.140]  You think they were glued together with four horses?
[27:21.860 --> 27:23.680]  Okay, let's see.
[27:24.220 --> 27:25.740]  Made of horses for horses.
[27:27.200 --> 27:30.960]  Here we got Sven Gunther Rothenberger.
[27:32.760 --> 27:33.500]  This is dressage.
[27:33.700 --> 27:36.460]  He won the gold medal in the World Cup in 1990.
[27:37.320 --> 27:37.700]  Sexy.
[27:38.340 --> 27:39.840]  Is it the guy or is it the horse?
[27:40.360 --> 27:41.840]  Soren von Roenger.
[27:42.040 --> 27:43.140]  I only want to know the horse names.
[27:43.220 --> 27:44.060]  I don't care about the people.
[27:44.280 --> 27:45.300]  They got horse names on there?
[27:45.440 --> 27:47.140]  These are all the fucking jockeys.
[27:48.240 --> 27:48.640]  Jockeys?
[27:50.140 --> 27:50.940]  It's dressage.
[27:50.960 --> 27:52.940]  Are you still a jockey if you do dressage?
[27:53.120 --> 27:54.840]  Of course you're a jockey, aren't you?
[27:55.060 --> 27:55.660]  Okay, here we go.
[27:56.680 --> 27:57.900]  The horse's name is...
[27:58.380 --> 27:58.800]  Thank you.
[27:59.340 --> 28:00.100]  Andy Almo.
[28:00.220 --> 28:00.560]  Okay.
[28:01.100 --> 28:02.840]  This horse's name is Taggy.
[28:03.020 --> 28:04.000]  That's a good horse name.
[28:04.040 --> 28:04.820]  This horse...
[28:04.820 --> 28:05.220]  Buttercup.
[28:05.440 --> 28:06.500]  Has no name.
[28:07.960 --> 28:08.360]  That's...
[28:08.360 --> 28:09.560]  Is that somebody just smoking...
[28:09.560 --> 28:10.920]  Is John Ritter smoking a pipe?
[28:11.240 --> 28:11.820]  That's not somebody.
[28:11.920 --> 28:14.860]  That's Frank Sluthak from Germany.
[28:15.480 --> 28:17.140]  Famous for jumping.
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.860]  Oh, here's Jane Bredden.
[28:23.060 --> 28:23.740]  Riding...
[28:23.740 --> 28:24.180]  Driving...
[28:24.180 --> 28:25.120]  Driving Cupido.
[28:25.480 --> 28:26.160]  Driving?
[28:27.460 --> 28:29.060]  Get on your horse and drive.
[28:29.360 --> 28:32.840]  Oh, here we got Tinnay Wilhelmsen from Sweden.
[28:33.020 --> 28:34.340]  Riding Caprice.
[28:34.640 --> 28:35.220]  Caprice.
[28:35.760 --> 28:37.520]  Then, not to be outdone.
[28:37.520 --> 28:40.520]  Here's James Barnfarm Nutton.
[28:41.380 --> 28:41.740]  What?
[28:41.820 --> 28:43.520]  And he is riding the horse Virtue.
[28:44.460 --> 28:46.320]  Wait, James Barnfarm Nutton?
[28:47.580 --> 28:49.180]  James Barnfarm Nutton.
[28:50.060 --> 28:50.960]  Oh, that's where he's from.
[28:51.620 --> 28:52.500]  Jesus Christ.
[28:52.620 --> 28:53.980]  The name is Emilio Fiori.
[28:54.220 --> 28:56.800]  Like, I hate receiving information this way.
[28:56.960 --> 28:59.800]  It makes me so anxious and puts me in such a bad mood.
[29:00.060 --> 29:00.220]  Yeah.
[29:00.260 --> 29:01.260]  It is so, like...
[29:01.260 --> 29:05.020]  It's in Great Britain. I wonder if Gavin's ever been to James Barnfarm Nutton.
[29:05.160 --> 29:06.120]  This fucking sucks.
[29:06.140 --> 29:06.620]  Where is Gavin?
[29:06.620 --> 29:08.420]  He might be in Barnfarm Nutton.
[29:08.780 --> 29:09.660]  Maybe we can't find him.
[29:09.820 --> 29:11.780]  Oh, this is also from James Barnfarm Nutton.
[29:12.120 --> 29:13.240]  This is Emil Fiori again.
[29:13.860 --> 29:14.520]  It's not his name.
[29:14.520 --> 29:16.380]  Oh, so the city is James Barnfarm Nutton?
[29:16.660 --> 29:16.920]  Yeah.
[29:17.180 --> 29:18.060]  It's like Stoke-on-Trent.
[29:18.900 --> 29:20.360]  It's Emil Fiori.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.860]  Wait, so it literally says home, colon, and then it has a thing.
[29:23.920 --> 29:25.480]  And you were just reading that saying it was a name?
[29:25.740 --> 29:28.260]  Well, I read the name James Barnfarm. It seemed like a name.
[29:28.480 --> 29:29.040]  That horse is a limo.
[29:29.060 --> 29:30.240]  It says home in front of it.
[29:30.400 --> 29:31.620]  You're fucking home.
[29:33.260 --> 29:33.980]  This sucks.
[29:34.460 --> 29:34.820]  Monsignor.
[29:34.820 --> 29:36.520]  Oh, you're going to like this horse.
[29:36.620 --> 29:38.980]  Am I? Is there any information you're going to give me that's right?
[29:39.240 --> 29:40.940]  Hi, my name is Austin Texas. Nice to meet you.
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.340]  Here's what I'm going to give you. Here's what I'm going to tell you.
[29:42.720 --> 29:44.140]  Pleasure to meet you, 78723.
[29:44.600 --> 29:46.620]  From Denmark, Johnny Larson.
[29:46.900 --> 29:47.400]  Are you sure?
[29:47.740 --> 29:48.560]  Janny Larson.
[29:49.020 --> 29:49.800]  Okay, so no.
[29:50.140 --> 29:51.760]  They're from J-N-N-I.
[29:52.320 --> 29:52.580]  Yanny?
[29:52.760 --> 29:53.640]  Yanny, probably.
[29:53.760 --> 29:54.660]  Yanny Larson.
[29:55.360 --> 29:55.900]  From Denmark.
[29:56.420 --> 29:59.460]  They live in Toltug, Lengelrod.
[30:00.260 --> 30:01.580]  That was one of my favorite steaming e-books.
[30:02.100 --> 30:02.860]  Friedensborg, Denmark.
[30:03.000 --> 30:03.640]  The Lengelrods?
[30:03.640 --> 30:04.740]  I think that might be their address.
[30:05.040 --> 30:11.760]  They live in Toltug, I-Lengelrod, DK-3480, Friedensborg, Denmark.
[30:11.900 --> 30:12.700]  Put that in Google Maps.
[30:12.720 --> 30:14.240]  The horse's name? Oliver Twist.
[30:14.860 --> 30:15.820]  Isn't that a beautiful horse?
[30:16.540 --> 30:18.560]  Pretty horse. That horse has got long legs, like that dog you like.
[30:18.760 --> 30:20.280]  So much information about nothing.
[30:20.760 --> 30:21.400]  Long legs.
[30:23.040 --> 30:23.740]  Oh, here you go.
[30:23.880 --> 30:25.380]  I can give you a little extra information on this one.
[30:25.460 --> 30:25.820]  No thanks.
[30:25.820 --> 30:28.280]  This is Mariel Solander from Sweden.
[30:28.660 --> 30:29.840]  Doing a pony jump.
[30:32.820 --> 30:35.220]  Mariotorp, S5796, ex-Joe Sweden.
[30:35.400 --> 30:36.320]  I guess that's their address.
[30:36.520 --> 30:36.940]  That's their address.
[30:37.020 --> 30:38.640]  Horse's name? What next?
[30:38.940 --> 30:40.320]  That's a cool horse name.
[30:40.880 --> 30:47.320]  Now, Mariel Solander won the Swedish Pony Derby in 1994, was the third individual...
[30:47.320 --> 30:53.540]  won third individually and took the gold medal with the Swedish team at the 1994 Nordic Championships with her pony Jimmy Lee.
[30:53.800 --> 30:58.840]  With her new pony, Mariel has continued to improve her results and was second in the Swedish Championships in 1995.
[31:00.080 --> 31:00.780]  There you go.
[31:00.840 --> 31:02.240]  Sorry, I didn't catch that. What was that?
[31:02.540 --> 31:03.500]  I will read it again.
[31:03.500 --> 31:04.240]  I was texting Katie.
[31:04.980 --> 31:08.540]  This, I hate the horse cards. Why weren't they just pictures of horses?
[31:08.740 --> 31:09.200]  All my children.
[31:09.400 --> 31:10.940]  Alright, this is what Geoff was excited about.
[31:11.080 --> 31:13.460]  This is what I was most excited about. Although Bingo turned out to be the real winner.
[31:13.580 --> 31:16.680]  Bingo was a real winner. Dog in sunglasses and afraid to go through fire hoop?
[31:16.840 --> 31:17.740]  Bingo can't do it.
[31:20.080 --> 31:21.400]  Bingo can't do it, you guys.
[31:21.620 --> 31:23.980]  We should just make it sure that Bingo can't do it.
[31:24.740 --> 31:28.940]  I think we can probably get the rights to this movie and put it on a shirt.
[31:29.040 --> 31:31.500]  I also think we can probably make that shirt and no one will know.
[31:32.120 --> 31:33.840]  It's 1991 TriStar Pictures.
[31:34.420 --> 31:36.360]  I don't even know if TriStar is still a thing anymore.
[31:36.400 --> 31:38.260]  TriStar, they got bought by Sony, I think.
[31:38.380 --> 31:41.200]  Oh man, and Sony got bought, so you can probably just get Bingo.
[31:41.540 --> 31:45.580]  Is there a way we can just do this for, bring back, what's the fucking show where you talk over movies?
[31:46.380 --> 31:46.920]  Theater Mode?
[31:47.020 --> 31:47.480]  Theater Mode.
[31:48.080 --> 31:50.220]  Why don't we just do it on Fuckface?
[31:50.680 --> 31:53.360]  Bingo? Because we can't even do the monkey movie, Geoff.
[31:54.340 --> 31:58.740]  As the audience laughs at Bingo's inability to perform, Steve yells,
[31:59.180 --> 32:01.980]  You're doing this on purpose! You hate me, don't you?
[32:02.140 --> 32:04.540]  You had it planned! You wanted to humiliate me!
[32:04.660 --> 32:07.420]  Come on, you little scud bucket mutt! Jump!
[32:08.300 --> 32:10.340]  It says that on the back of the card.
[32:10.640 --> 32:12.040]  Somebody yelled that at the dog?
[32:12.140 --> 32:14.860]  The dog wearing a fucking sweater and tutu.
[32:15.420 --> 32:18.560]  He thought the dog was doing this on purpose?
[32:19.360 --> 32:20.760]  Alright, Geoff, all my children.
[32:21.020 --> 32:21.900]  This is gonna be good.
[32:21.960 --> 32:22.620]  Okay, let's do it.
[32:22.620 --> 32:23.220]  This is gonna be good.
[32:23.800 --> 32:24.780]  Bingo can't do it.
[32:24.800 --> 32:27.860]  Right off the gate, we got Joe Martin.
[32:27.980 --> 32:28.300]  Okay.
[32:28.540 --> 32:28.980]  Big fan.
[32:29.800 --> 32:30.760]  Classic eyebrows.
[32:31.440 --> 32:33.980]  That's like generic 60s actor face.
[32:33.980 --> 32:38.060]  Either married to or father of Dixie Martin.
[32:38.220 --> 32:38.420]  Okay.
[32:39.320 --> 32:41.060]  Could be married to. Wow, that's some hair.
[32:41.400 --> 32:42.840]  Okay, then this is gonna be fun.
[32:43.140 --> 32:45.080]  We have some trivia.
[32:45.980 --> 32:46.360]  Great.
[32:47.160 --> 32:50.760]  What was the name of Yvonne's earlier place of employment?
[32:51.540 --> 32:53.840]  I'll give you the options.
[32:55.020 --> 32:57.800]  Panache is A. B is the Blue Note.
[32:58.540 --> 33:00.760]  C is Rendezvous.
[33:01.820 --> 33:03.820]  D is Le Chateau.
[33:04.100 --> 33:05.480]  E is McKay's.
[33:05.820 --> 33:07.040]  And F is Foxy's.
[33:07.140 --> 33:08.440]  Six options, that's odd.
[33:08.540 --> 33:09.220]  You usually get five.
[33:09.240 --> 33:15.480]  So Panache, the Blue Note, Rendezvous, Le Chateau, McKay's, or Foxy's.
[33:15.500 --> 33:17.180]  Rendezvous, C, Rendezvous, lock it in.
[33:17.260 --> 33:17.760]  It's Blue Note.
[33:18.000 --> 33:18.400]  Lock it in.
[33:18.400 --> 33:19.060]  Obviously Blue Note.
[33:19.940 --> 33:20.600]  What's your answer?
[33:20.960 --> 33:21.960]  What is it?
[33:22.120 --> 33:22.640]  Jack is correct.
[33:22.740 --> 33:23.400]  It is the Blue Note.
[33:24.200 --> 33:25.220]  It is the Blue Note.
[33:25.300 --> 33:26.420]  Big Days of Your Life fan.
[33:26.460 --> 33:27.280]  What show is this?
[33:27.480 --> 33:27.960]  Oh, my children.
[33:28.880 --> 33:30.860]  We had a whole Days of Our Lives conversation earlier.
[33:30.980 --> 33:31.460]  Days of Our Lives.
[33:31.480 --> 33:32.240]  It's on the Peacock.
[33:32.480 --> 33:33.260]  It's on Peacock now.
[33:33.280 --> 33:33.460]  Oh, is it?
[33:33.560 --> 33:33.740]  Yeah.
[33:34.220 --> 33:34.580]  Brooke.
[33:34.640 --> 33:35.320]  No one's watching it.
[33:35.900 --> 33:36.260]  English.
[33:36.620 --> 33:36.840]  Oh.
[33:37.060 --> 33:38.720]  You watch South Park and then Days of Our Lives.
[33:39.080 --> 33:39.980]  Raymond, Spanish.
[33:40.920 --> 33:41.880]  I don't know how to say this guy's name.
[33:42.200 --> 33:43.060]  Todd Cudahy.
[33:43.380 --> 33:43.740]  Cuday.
[33:43.940 --> 33:44.300]  Cudahay.
[33:44.700 --> 33:45.040]  Cuday.
[33:45.420 --> 33:45.780]  Cruditay.
[33:46.120 --> 33:46.480]  Cruditay.
[33:46.480 --> 33:47.540]  Todd Cruditay.
[33:47.880 --> 33:48.240]  Todd Cruditay.
[33:48.240 --> 33:49.860]  Oh, now this is a great...
[33:49.860 --> 33:51.280]  Look at the backdrop on these cards.
[33:51.420 --> 33:52.680]  This is fucking...
[33:52.680 --> 33:54.060]  This is 80s sexy.
[33:54.060 --> 33:54.200]  All right.
[33:54.260 --> 33:54.600]  What do we got?
[33:55.380 --> 33:56.600]  Jackson and Erica.
[33:56.840 --> 33:58.560]  Talk about couple goals.
[33:58.820 --> 33:59.380]  Fucking Smulder.
[33:59.720 --> 34:00.080]  Dude.
[34:00.600 --> 34:02.480]  That's like the dollar bin version of Pretty Woman.
[34:02.680 --> 34:03.220]  Is that...
[34:03.220 --> 34:03.700]  What's her name?
[34:03.760 --> 34:05.180]  She was on the show for like ever?
[34:05.760 --> 34:06.380]  Suzanne Lucci?
[34:06.520 --> 34:06.680]  Yeah.
[34:06.920 --> 34:07.620]  No, I don't think so.
[34:07.820 --> 34:08.660]  But she might be coming.
[34:09.880 --> 34:10.860]  Yeah, this is like...
[34:10.860 --> 34:12.480]  That guy is Agent Smulder right there.
[34:13.100 --> 34:14.540]  We can go ahead and slave that for you guys.
[34:14.620 --> 34:14.780]  Wow.
[34:14.780 --> 34:15.760]  I'm going to take that to the...
[34:15.760 --> 34:16.200]  That's for you.
[34:17.580 --> 34:18.380]  What happened?
[34:18.500 --> 34:19.020]  Oh, here we go.
[34:19.240 --> 34:19.760]  What happened?
[34:23.540 --> 34:24.680]  Okay, I don't know why.
[34:25.840 --> 34:26.240]  Sultry.
[34:26.680 --> 34:27.020]  All right.
[34:27.200 --> 34:28.600]  I think that might be Suzanne Lucci.
[34:28.920 --> 34:29.100]  Okay.
[34:29.420 --> 34:31.220]  And then on the backside...
[34:31.960 --> 34:32.360]  Flirtatious.
[34:33.000 --> 34:33.400]  Flirtatious.
[34:34.120 --> 34:34.980]  Here's my sexy.
[34:35.280 --> 34:36.280]  Here's my flirtatious.
[34:36.340 --> 34:37.180]  We'll leave it on flirtatious.
[34:37.260 --> 34:39.620]  Flirtatious is tricky because she's always walking away from you.
[34:40.720 --> 34:42.360]  And then we have...
[34:42.360 --> 34:43.140]  Oh, interesting.
[34:43.140 --> 34:45.420]  You want to know how the sausage is made?
[34:45.700 --> 34:45.840]  Yeah.
[34:45.920 --> 34:47.080]  Well, tune in to Sausage Talk.
[34:47.120 --> 34:47.580]  Yeah, that's true.
[34:47.700 --> 34:48.400]  It's out tomorrow.
[34:48.720 --> 34:49.400]  Episode one of that.
[34:49.600 --> 34:50.280]  Out right now.
[34:50.380 --> 34:51.040]  In public tomorrow.
[34:52.160 --> 34:55.000]  But if you want to know how their sausage is made, it's...
[34:55.000 --> 34:55.600]  There you go.
[34:55.720 --> 34:56.020]  BTS.
[34:56.020 --> 34:56.700]  Behind the scenes.
[34:56.820 --> 34:57.180]  Oh, wow.
[34:57.700 --> 34:59.920]  You can see right there they have a...
[34:59.920 --> 35:02.340]  They replaced her head with a clacker board.
[35:02.440 --> 35:02.940]  Clacker board, yeah.
[35:03.840 --> 35:05.140]  Oh, and then we have...
[35:08.240 --> 35:08.960]  Ava Rescott.
[35:09.120 --> 35:10.140]  She's loving.
[35:11.460 --> 35:11.820]  Okay.
[35:11.820 --> 35:12.600]  All right.
[35:12.760 --> 35:15.020]  And I am loving these cards.
[35:15.400 --> 35:17.000]  That's why they're all going in the bin.
[35:17.180 --> 35:18.240]  Yeah, that's why they're all going in the bin.
[35:18.380 --> 35:19.160]  All right, what do we got next, baby?
[35:19.360 --> 35:19.440]  What do we got?
[35:19.480 --> 35:21.480]  Let's open up this pack of NFL prestige.
[35:21.700 --> 35:23.640]  You've been waiting because you're an NFL guy now.
[35:23.700 --> 35:24.520]  I'm an NFL guy now, yeah.
[35:24.640 --> 35:25.840]  I'm not a big fan of prestige.
[35:26.240 --> 35:26.880]  It's kind of doo-doo.
[35:27.080 --> 35:29.520]  But I get desperate, so I buy what I can.
[35:30.760 --> 35:32.580]  That is a fat stack of cards.
[35:33.100 --> 35:33.740]  Jim Kelly.
[35:33.960 --> 35:34.240]  Okay.
[35:36.820 --> 35:37.540]  Jared Goff.
[35:37.560 --> 35:39.140]  That's so many cards, you're right.
[35:39.200 --> 35:39.700]  Yeah, it really is.
[35:39.960 --> 35:40.980]  Robert Quinn.
[35:40.980 --> 35:43.380]  Goff was like a mid-tier quarterback.
[35:43.760 --> 35:44.520]  Matt Ryan.
[35:44.640 --> 35:45.540]  He was a good pick-up for fantasy.
[35:45.860 --> 35:48.520]  Like, in a week, you needed someone to replace your starter.
[35:48.820 --> 35:51.180]  The Lions might be good this year.
[35:51.440 --> 35:51.620]  We'll see.
[35:51.620 --> 35:52.860]  The Colts are falling apart, aren't they?
[35:53.120 --> 35:53.760]  I think it's one.
[35:54.120 --> 35:54.940]  Dawson Knox.
[35:55.060 --> 35:55.460]  Yeah, they did.
[35:55.780 --> 35:56.120]  I don't watch them.
[35:58.660 --> 35:59.060]  Albert.
[36:01.020 --> 36:01.740]  Alex Albert?
[36:02.240 --> 36:03.080]  What's up, big Albert?
[36:03.240 --> 36:04.020]  David Montgomery.
[36:05.700 --> 36:07.260]  Another blast from the past, Barry Sanders.
[36:07.520 --> 36:07.920]  Oh, nice.
[36:08.140 --> 36:09.520]  I think the greatest running back of all time.
[36:09.600 --> 36:10.200]  I can see that.
[36:10.200 --> 36:10.820]  And you know why?
[36:11.020 --> 36:12.860]  Because he retired when his body still worked.
[36:13.020 --> 36:13.140]  Yeah.
[36:13.240 --> 36:14.000]  He left early.
[36:14.100 --> 36:15.400]  Oh, the smartest running back of all time.
[36:15.400 --> 36:19.040]  I was about to say Emmitt Smith might have an argument, but then you continue to talk,
[36:19.040 --> 36:19.800]  and I'm like, okay, that makes sense.
[36:20.460 --> 36:23.140]  If Barry Sanders had played as long as Emmitt Smith did, it would be a different story.
[36:23.260 --> 36:25.620]  I think Emmitt Smith's phenomenal, but I thought Barry Sanders was much better.
[36:25.880 --> 36:28.500]  He was just like, I'm not going to end up...
[36:28.500 --> 36:30.300]  I'd like to walk in my 60s.
[36:31.120 --> 36:31.760]  AJ Green.
[36:33.160 --> 36:33.800]  Brevin Jordan.
[36:35.360 --> 36:36.000]  Clyde Edwards.
[36:37.220 --> 36:37.540]  Hilaire.
[36:39.060 --> 36:39.700]  Damien Harris.
[36:41.100 --> 36:41.980]  Joey Bosa.
[36:42.600 --> 36:44.520]  Ooh, here we go, a little rookie action.
[36:44.700 --> 36:47.400]  Oh, it's not though, because it's a second year card, because it's next year.
[36:47.580 --> 36:48.380]  Najee Harris.
[36:49.720 --> 36:52.340]  Former Alabama player.
[36:52.640 --> 36:53.080]  Alabama!
[36:54.540 --> 36:55.420]  Hunter Henry.
[36:55.820 --> 36:56.220]  Okay.
[36:57.660 --> 36:58.540]  Quandre Diggs.
[36:58.620 --> 36:59.520]  Not loving these cards.
[36:59.840 --> 37:00.520]  Kenny Gallagher.
[37:00.640 --> 37:01.380]  Yeah, they're not good.
[37:02.300 --> 37:04.780]  There's too many of them, and none of them are interesting.
[37:05.000 --> 37:05.740]  Montez Sweat.
[37:05.980 --> 37:06.980]  Tyler Lockett.
[37:07.180 --> 37:08.740]  Can we save Montez Sweat?
[37:09.280 --> 37:10.000]  That's a great name.
[37:10.000 --> 37:10.740]  That is a good name.
[37:10.900 --> 37:11.460]  That's a good call, thank you.
[37:11.480 --> 37:12.800]  It's part of the food call.
[37:13.340 --> 37:16.360]  Yeah, that's what you do after you eat too much bacon.
[37:16.620 --> 37:17.560]  Too much Dwayne Bacon.
[37:18.980 --> 37:20.820]  John Meche, the third rookie.
[37:21.020 --> 37:21.200]  Okay.
[37:22.700 --> 37:23.100]  Boy...
[37:23.100 --> 37:23.720]  Howdy?
[37:24.420 --> 37:24.820]  Howdy.
[37:25.280 --> 37:25.580]  Rookie.
[37:26.460 --> 37:27.640]  David Bell, rookie.
[37:27.820 --> 37:29.040]  Not to be confused with the baseball player.
[37:29.180 --> 37:29.300]  Yeah.
[37:29.860 --> 37:31.140]  Evan Neal, rookie.
[37:31.460 --> 37:33.300]  Ooh, here we go, here we go.
[37:33.500 --> 37:34.060]  We have a...
[37:34.060 --> 37:35.120]  Got some fancy hollows there.
[37:36.940 --> 37:37.740]  Nyheim Hines.
[37:38.220 --> 37:39.020]  Starburst Parallels.
[37:39.020 --> 37:40.260]  Ooh, are we gonna sleeve that one?
[37:40.440 --> 37:40.580]  Yeah.
[37:40.840 --> 37:41.200]  Nice.
[37:41.740 --> 37:42.420]  Oh, shit!
[37:42.640 --> 37:43.860]  This is another Alabama player.
[37:43.980 --> 37:44.580]  Devonta Smith.
[37:45.340 --> 37:48.380]  Wow, so the last ten cards of these are, like, good.
[37:48.680 --> 37:48.880]  Yeah.
[37:49.060 --> 37:49.660]  Oh, okay.
[37:49.800 --> 37:50.640]  I see how this goes.
[37:50.740 --> 37:51.180]  Look at that.
[37:51.240 --> 37:51.580]  That's pretty.
[37:51.580 --> 37:52.100]  That's a good one.
[37:52.400 --> 37:54.600]  That's where, like, if Emily was here, she'd hit the laser button.
[37:56.040 --> 37:57.240]  Squirt it in my mouth, daddy.
[37:57.340 --> 37:57.660]  Fuck.
[37:57.760 --> 37:58.060]  Close enough.
[37:59.420 --> 38:00.020]  Close enough.
[38:00.160 --> 38:00.860]  DK Metcalf.
[38:01.460 --> 38:02.680]  He's a powerhouse.
[38:02.980 --> 38:04.320]  I thought you said powerhorse.
[38:04.720 --> 38:05.080]  Powerhorse.
[38:05.840 --> 38:07.000]  These are the wrong cards.
[38:07.280 --> 38:08.020]  Tyler Lockett.
[38:09.100 --> 38:11.320]  That's a highlight from when he caught a ball.
[38:12.820 --> 38:15.380]  Mike Evans is prestigious.
[38:16.580 --> 38:17.960]  He's been hurt, hasn't he?
[38:17.960 --> 38:18.460]  Is he back yet?
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.380]  And then living legends, Phil Sims.
[38:22.040 --> 38:22.640]  Phil Sims.
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.660]  His son was a piece of crap.
[38:24.780 --> 38:25.620]  Well, his...
[38:25.620 --> 38:27.300]  I don't know if he's a piece of crap, but...
[38:27.300 --> 38:27.780]  He went to UT.
[38:28.000 --> 38:28.840]  He did go to UT.
[38:28.840 --> 38:29.540]  Pretty shitty.
[38:30.580 --> 38:31.740]  Nah, it's all right.
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.260]  The sire of Sims.
[38:34.180 --> 38:34.720]  Sim sire.
[38:35.380 --> 38:35.820]  All right.
[38:35.840 --> 38:37.800]  You have the mail that you can get to.
[38:37.980 --> 38:38.200]  Yeah.
[38:38.200 --> 38:38.800]  I do have that.
[38:39.060 --> 38:40.020]  That should be fun.
[38:40.120 --> 38:41.780]  We got Manning's kid.
[38:42.040 --> 38:44.880]  Like the third Manning's son is now playing for UT.
[38:45.220 --> 38:46.520]  Is it Archie Manning or whatever his name is?
[38:46.840 --> 38:48.640]  It's Army Manning, I think.
[38:48.800 --> 38:49.240]  Or Arnie?
[38:49.420 --> 38:49.880]  I don't know.
[38:50.100 --> 38:51.680]  So this is from Andrew.
[38:52.560 --> 38:53.220]  Different Andrew.
[38:53.920 --> 38:55.520]  He sent us some...
[38:55.520 --> 38:56.600]  I think there's a card in there, too.
[38:56.700 --> 38:57.520]  Pretty jazzed about this.
[38:57.520 --> 38:59.340]  Didn't Manning used to get piped into these shows?
[38:59.500 --> 39:00.060]  Yeah, he used to.
[39:00.080 --> 39:01.400]  Yeah, when he would show up.
[39:01.420 --> 39:01.940]  When he's available.
[39:02.160 --> 39:03.880]  He's pulling a real jack.
[39:04.100 --> 39:05.100]  It's a little long.
[39:05.200 --> 39:06.000]  You don't have to read the whole card.
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.340]  Just get the name right and we can hit it.
[39:08.380 --> 39:09.960]  You want me to read it while you start opening these things?
[39:11.680 --> 39:12.780]  Anyway, thank you, Andrew.
[39:13.220 --> 39:16.100]  Thank you for grand times from Sweden.
[39:16.480 --> 39:16.640]  See?
[39:17.300 --> 39:19.260]  Isn't Sweden, that's where the death diving is, right?
[39:19.420 --> 39:19.600]  Yeah.
[39:19.940 --> 39:20.480]  That's where...
[39:20.480 --> 39:25.220]  We'll be coming to you soon, Andrew, when we compete in the death diving championships.
[39:25.440 --> 39:25.560]  We will?
[39:26.280 --> 39:26.960]  Who's competing?
[39:27.980 --> 39:30.840]  Well, I definitely am going to compete in death diving.
[39:30.940 --> 39:31.220]  Are you kidding?
[39:31.280 --> 39:33.760]  If you want to see real death, it's coming a lot.
[39:34.020 --> 39:34.880]  Literal death diving.
[39:34.880 --> 39:36.080]  I watched some of those clips.
[39:36.180 --> 39:36.940]  My God, man.
[39:36.940 --> 39:37.060]  Insane, right?
[39:37.360 --> 39:38.320]  I would do it in a second.
[39:38.420 --> 39:38.900]  I would love to.
[39:39.040 --> 39:41.060]  You say that, then you get up on top of that platform.
[39:41.420 --> 39:45.080]  I don't think you look at me like, I'm just going to whip myself off this board.
[39:45.560 --> 39:48.260]  Do you know how much dumb shit I do on a daily basis?
[39:48.580 --> 39:49.980]  You know what's not going to happen to me?
[39:50.380 --> 39:52.480]  I'll get the fucking wind knocked out of me.
[39:52.780 --> 39:57.560]  I'll live past that, but I'm not going to be dealing with fucking scabs for the next four months from it.
[39:57.640 --> 39:59.160]  I'm not going to get road rash from it.
[39:59.180 --> 40:00.660]  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you underwater.
[40:00.940 --> 40:01.960]  You're going to go underwater.
[40:01.960 --> 40:03.820]  You're going to give everyone jock itch.
[40:03.820 --> 40:05.800]  Everyone who's that cold is going to get jock itch.
[40:05.900 --> 40:08.040]  You're going to get pulled out of the water.
[40:08.040 --> 40:08.920]  How's your jock itch, buddy?
[40:09.140 --> 40:10.100]  It's fucking jock itch, dude.
[40:10.160 --> 40:11.000]  It's still not going away?
[40:11.200 --> 40:13.620]  I mean, it's going away, but it's still... it's not gone.
[40:13.980 --> 40:14.920]  All right, let's open these packs.
[40:15.380 --> 40:18.300]  But the nice thing about Andrew is that he sent these to us, but he also said,
[40:19.100 --> 40:22.680]  Dear Geoff, Eric, Nick, Emily, Gavin, and Andrew didn't...
[40:22.680 --> 40:23.380]  Cool, I'm right here.
[40:23.480 --> 40:24.260]  I'm right here, Andrew.
[40:24.720 --> 40:25.580]  I'm right here.
[40:26.480 --> 40:28.000]  You can take a look at that if you want.
[40:28.560 --> 40:29.380]  He sent us cards.
[40:29.500 --> 40:30.440]  I'm very excited about these.
[40:30.440 --> 40:33.280]  These are Swedish Hockey League cards.
[40:33.400 --> 40:36.880]  He sent them specifically because he knew that Geoff couldn't say names.
[40:36.940 --> 40:37.240]  Nice.
[40:37.240 --> 40:37.860]  So this is pretty exciting.
[40:37.880 --> 40:40.680]  I do appreciate the last line is thank you for grand times.
[40:40.700 --> 40:40.900]  Yep.
[40:41.120 --> 40:42.380]  That's a cool term.
[40:42.420 --> 40:42.840]  That's a good way to say it.
[40:43.000 --> 40:43.720]  Grand time.
[40:43.820 --> 40:48.060]  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to mispronounce and insult your country.
[40:49.060 --> 40:49.780]  Let's do it.
[40:49.900 --> 40:51.600]  All right, we're going to open these bad boys up.
[40:51.720 --> 40:53.220]  Oh, that's when you use the knife?
[40:53.280 --> 40:53.460]  Yeah.
[40:56.480 --> 40:57.460]  Well, let's do like...
[40:57.960 --> 40:58.920]  You got to feed the pack sack.
[40:58.920 --> 40:59.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41:00.700 --> 41:01.760]  Don't yeah, yeah, yeah me.
[41:01.960 --> 41:02.440]  Put it in the pack sack.
[41:02.620 --> 41:03.020]  You know what?
[41:03.160 --> 41:03.900]  That was unfair.
[41:04.060 --> 41:04.720]  That was unkind of me.
[41:04.740 --> 41:05.100]  You're right.
[41:05.260 --> 41:05.640]  You're right.
[41:05.820 --> 41:06.260]  I should...
[41:06.260 --> 41:06.840]  I was going through.
[41:08.700 --> 41:09.860]  But you are 100% right.
[41:09.900 --> 41:10.500]  You're just producing.
[41:10.660 --> 41:11.340]  You're just doing your job.
[41:11.400 --> 41:12.100]  You don't need...
[41:13.280 --> 41:14.480]  You don't need my guff.
[41:15.300 --> 41:15.820]  All right.
[41:15.880 --> 41:18.120]  Let's put a couple of these bad boys in there too.
[41:18.180 --> 41:18.800]  Did you knock over a Zimmer Bear?
[41:19.080 --> 41:21.100]  I'm trying to put the card over here.
[41:21.260 --> 41:21.340]  Here we go.
[41:21.340 --> 41:24.120]  We'll open three of these and three of these today.
[41:24.120 --> 41:24.480]  I love it.
[41:25.440 --> 41:26.940]  And then we'll hold on to the rest.
[41:26.940 --> 41:27.440]  Save them the rest.
[41:27.440 --> 41:27.900]  You never know.
[41:28.120 --> 41:28.860]  They go right here.
[41:29.480 --> 41:30.600]  SHL Elite Set.
[41:31.520 --> 41:32.240]  Elite Set.
[41:33.720 --> 41:35.220]  These are all the rage in Sweden.
[41:35.840 --> 41:37.040]  Everybody who knows, knows.
[41:37.960 --> 41:38.860]  Real heads know.
[41:39.260 --> 41:39.440]  Yeah.
[41:40.220 --> 41:42.200]  But I mean, like, everyone plays hockey in Sweden.
[41:42.260 --> 41:44.740]  So is it really rare to be a hockey player in Sweden?
[41:45.780 --> 41:46.320]  Why would it be rare?
[41:47.480 --> 41:48.060]  Well, because like...
[41:48.060 --> 41:48.560]  You said they're all the rage.
[41:48.680 --> 41:49.260]  I didn't say they were rare.
[41:49.380 --> 41:50.840]  But I mean, it's like...
[41:50.840 --> 41:53.440]  Yeah, it's like every kid in Sweden...
[41:53.440 --> 41:57.540]  buys a Swedish soda at the Swedish 7-Eleven.
[41:58.020 --> 41:58.240]  Okay.
[41:58.600 --> 41:59.450]  And it's called like a...
[42:01.420 --> 42:01.840]  Globstrom.
[42:01.980 --> 42:02.180]  Okay.
[42:02.280 --> 42:02.740]  The Globstrom.
[42:02.880 --> 42:04.100]  You go to the Globstrom.
[42:04.240 --> 42:06.020]  And you pick up a Flerden drink.
[42:06.360 --> 42:07.980]  And then you open...
[42:07.980 --> 42:08.660]  And you add a pack of these.
[42:08.840 --> 42:10.660]  And you look for your favorite hockey player.
[42:10.780 --> 42:11.480]  Is that racist, Eric?
[42:11.480 --> 42:11.640]  Yeah.
[42:11.800 --> 42:12.200]  Yeah, absolutely.
[42:12.300 --> 42:12.480]  100%.
[42:12.920 --> 42:13.740]  I'm part Swedish.
[42:14.660 --> 42:15.280]  What part?
[42:15.940 --> 42:16.900]  This is my...
[42:16.900 --> 42:17.900]  I'm not sure which part.
[42:18.760 --> 42:19.500]  I don't know.
[42:19.560 --> 42:19.660]  I forget.
[42:20.140 --> 42:20.780]  All right, let's see.
[42:20.880 --> 42:21.380]  Here we go.
[42:21.380 --> 42:22.660]  Name pronunciations.
[42:22.780 --> 42:23.080]  Here we go.
[42:23.160 --> 42:23.780]  This is gonna be fun.
[42:23.920 --> 42:24.060]  Yep.
[42:24.340 --> 42:25.180]  Robin Figrin.
[42:25.380 --> 42:25.640]  Okay.
[42:25.780 --> 42:26.360]  So far, so bad.
[42:27.260 --> 42:27.660]  Uh...
[42:27.660 --> 42:28.840]  Michael Johansson.
[42:29.300 --> 42:29.700]  Johansson.
[42:32.200 --> 42:33.000]  And Roth.
[42:36.340 --> 42:36.660]  Uh-huh.
[42:36.720 --> 42:37.620]  Take a stab at it, Geoffrey.
[42:37.900 --> 42:38.380]  We got a big-ass hit.
[42:38.640 --> 42:38.880]  Okay.
[42:39.080 --> 42:40.000]  We got a big-ass hit right now.
[42:40.040 --> 42:40.260]  Okay.
[42:40.680 --> 42:41.080]  Congratulations.
[42:41.400 --> 42:42.880]  You have received a signature card.
[42:42.920 --> 42:43.580]  Oh, really?
[42:43.980 --> 42:46.980]  Personally signed by Pasi Pustola.
[42:47.280 --> 42:48.220]  Pasi Pustola?
[42:48.460 --> 42:49.080]  Look at that.
[42:49.120 --> 42:50.380]  That is one fucking card.
[42:50.400 --> 42:50.820]  Is it really?
[42:51.100 --> 42:51.700]  Yeah, dude.
[42:51.700 --> 42:53.360]  Is that really what a signature looks like?
[42:53.360 --> 42:53.500]  I got a Pasi Pustola.
[42:53.720 --> 42:53.980]  Yeah.
[42:54.160 --> 42:55.520]  Go ahead and take care of that.
[42:55.520 --> 42:57.460]  And then you're gonna wanna put that in this as well.
[42:57.940 --> 42:58.500]  That's a good card.
[42:58.600 --> 42:58.980]  Thank you.
[42:59.220 --> 42:59.380]  Damn.
[43:00.000 --> 43:00.760]  A lot of people don't know this.
[43:00.780 --> 43:01.760]  I'm a Pasi Pustola fan.
[43:01.780 --> 43:02.180]  You're not.
[43:02.360 --> 43:03.060]  As of this moment.
[43:03.060 --> 43:04.180]  Okay, what team does he play for?
[43:04.780 --> 43:05.400]  Uh, today?
[43:05.500 --> 43:05.860]  I'm not sure.
[43:06.540 --> 43:07.700]  I will say his...
[43:07.700 --> 43:10.960]  It looks like the logo for, like, the name sponsor is Husqvarna.
[43:12.040 --> 43:12.380]  Huskyvarna?
[43:12.520 --> 43:13.300]  Which is, like...
[43:13.300 --> 43:14.760]  That's, like, the tractor company, isn't it?
[43:14.860 --> 43:15.200]  Husqvarna?
[43:15.660 --> 43:16.300]  Husqvarna does...
[43:16.300 --> 43:17.420]  They do farm equipment.
[43:17.500 --> 43:18.100]  They do chainsaws.
[43:18.200 --> 43:18.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[43:18.540 --> 43:19.080]  That's awesome.
[43:19.340 --> 43:20.100]  They make really good chainsaws.
[43:20.820 --> 43:22.020]  Uh, Martin Johansson.
[43:22.180 --> 43:22.480]  Okay.
[43:23.220 --> 43:24.460]  Uh, Henrik Eriksson.
[43:24.740 --> 43:25.560]  I'm fucking nailing these.
[43:25.560 --> 43:26.500]  Yeah, you're doing great.
[43:26.620 --> 43:26.920]  Heinrich.
[43:27.180 --> 43:29.000]  Uh, it depends on which region of Sweden you're from.
[43:29.080 --> 43:30.140]  If you're in southern Sweden, it's Henrik.
[43:31.020 --> 43:33.200]  Uh, learn a little bit before you open your mouth.
[43:34.600 --> 43:35.540]  Uh, Patrick Zachrisson.
[43:36.460 --> 43:36.740]  Okay.
[43:37.020 --> 43:38.640]  Which I know it sounds weird, but that's how you say it.
[43:39.040 --> 43:39.360]  That's...
[43:39.360 --> 43:40.380]  That's how you say it.
[43:40.440 --> 43:41.500]  No, I don't make the rules.
[43:42.080 --> 43:42.620]  Uh, all right.
[43:42.660 --> 43:44.060]  Well, now we'll open up these bad boys.
[43:44.160 --> 43:44.740]  Okay, what are these?
[43:44.900 --> 43:45.960]  These are the...
[43:46.960 --> 43:47.600]  Exclusive 2021.
[43:47.600 --> 43:48.280]  I don't know.
[43:49.120 --> 43:49.780]  This is like...
[43:49.780 --> 43:50.460]  I don't recognize...
[43:50.460 --> 43:50.980]  I'll be honest, man.
[43:50.980 --> 43:51.720]  I'll get in the way.
[43:51.960 --> 43:53.440]  I don't recognize some of these letters.
[43:53.880 --> 43:54.020]  Yes.
[43:54.360 --> 43:55.080]  That looks like...
[43:55.080 --> 43:56.480]  Is that Russian?
[43:56.860 --> 43:57.000]  Yes.
[43:57.300 --> 43:59.480]  I think he sent the Swedish pack, and then he said,
[43:59.580 --> 44:00.520]  I think here's the second pack.
[44:00.600 --> 44:01.240]  I think they're Russian.
[44:01.380 --> 44:02.220]  Okay, it seems Russian.
[44:03.280 --> 44:04.640]  It does seem Russian.
[44:05.960 --> 44:08.680]  The way they got, like, backwards R's and stuff.
[44:08.800 --> 44:08.920]  Yeah.
[44:10.420 --> 44:13.280]  Liberal use of X's and backwards N with a...
[44:13.280 --> 44:13.880]  I like that H.
[44:14.100 --> 44:14.540]  All right, here we go.
[44:14.640 --> 44:14.820]  Here we go.
[44:14.840 --> 44:15.200]  Here we go.
[44:15.200 --> 44:16.260]  All right, Geoff, go ahead.
[44:16.500 --> 44:16.820]  Fuck me.
[44:21.580 --> 44:24.240]  I think that's a barbecue joint, right?
[44:24.360 --> 44:24.620]  Yeah, yeah.
[44:26.240 --> 44:27.500]  This is a great one.
[44:27.780 --> 44:28.940]  It's like Dimetapp in Russia.
[44:33.580 --> 44:35.440]  I think I'm getting pretty good here.
[44:36.100 --> 44:36.540]  This is...
[44:36.540 --> 44:37.200]  Oh, this is...
[44:41.020 --> 44:41.420]  Obviously.
[44:42.280 --> 44:43.380]  Here we have...
[44:45.200 --> 44:46.400]  I think it's backwards.
[44:46.820 --> 44:49.240]  It's E-N-R-T, but I think it would be...
[44:54.400 --> 44:56.300]  Were there no vowels in that last name?
[45:00.540 --> 45:01.640]  Those are good.
[45:01.720 --> 45:02.980]  Let's get back to the Swedish ones.
[45:04.440 --> 45:06.420]  Let's get some kind of respite.
[45:09.060 --> 45:11.360]  Some reprieve in just saying these Swedish names.
[45:13.380 --> 45:13.980]  Got it.
[45:16.580 --> 45:17.900]  Oh, what is this?
[45:21.080 --> 45:21.760]  Nailed that.
[45:21.820 --> 45:22.520]  Go ahead and sleeve that, please.
[45:22.600 --> 45:23.040]  You got it.
[45:23.180 --> 45:26.420]  I am destroying these names.
[45:26.480 --> 45:28.500]  You're doing great for the Swedish ones.
[45:36.400 --> 45:37.500]  Back to Russia?
[45:37.620 --> 45:38.640]  Here we go, Russia.
[45:38.920 --> 45:39.180]  I assume.
[45:39.340 --> 45:40.140]  Let's go, Russia.
[45:42.200 --> 45:43.040]  Good sound bite.
[45:46.280 --> 45:48.020]  Okay, we got...
[45:48.020 --> 45:50.080]  Playing for the flying A's.
[45:50.520 --> 45:51.200]  We have...
[45:54.760 --> 46:00.420]  It sounds like Gavin's making up names.
[46:03.020 --> 46:04.340]  It's like Jeremy.
[46:07.800 --> 46:09.620]  If anybody has any...
[46:09.620 --> 46:15.120]  It's G-P-B-1-H-Q-E-V.
[46:15.200 --> 46:17.200]  Was there a niner in there?
[46:19.700 --> 46:25.400]  Dude, these Russian cards are good.
[46:35.980 --> 46:37.720]  That's just your password.
[46:37.720 --> 46:38.520]  Six.
[46:43.900 --> 46:46.440]  All of these are last pass autofills.
[46:46.580 --> 46:47.500]  That's pretty exciting.
[46:49.900 --> 46:51.900]  Let's get back to Sweden, please.
[46:52.080 --> 46:52.680]  Back to Sweden.
[46:52.900 --> 46:53.560]  Back to Sweden.
[46:54.660 --> 46:55.580]  Oh, man.
[46:59.020 --> 47:00.140]  Oh, no.
[47:04.760 --> 47:05.980]  I'm a big fan of that guy.
[47:09.980 --> 47:10.780]  Jonathan Granström.
[47:12.660 --> 47:13.460]  Ari Valin.
[47:13.700 --> 47:14.360]  Valin, maybe.
[47:14.760 --> 47:16.720]  Markus Ragnarsson.
[47:17.360 --> 47:19.400]  I think he's a competitive lifter, too, right?
[47:21.420 --> 47:22.220]  Johan Davidsson.
[47:23.980 --> 47:25.240]  Hilarious on a living computer.
[47:25.660 --> 47:29.960]  And now, our last pack that we are opening of the hockey cards.
[47:30.200 --> 47:30.920]  The last Russian pack.
[47:31.400 --> 47:31.800]  Today.
[47:32.240 --> 47:32.480]  Today.
[47:32.780 --> 47:33.540]  Oh, we're definitely...
[47:33.540 --> 47:34.280]  Oh, trust me.
[47:34.340 --> 47:35.280]  We're getting to the rest.
[47:35.680 --> 47:38.580]  I'm excited for one of these packs every time.
[47:39.220 --> 47:46.120]  Oh, this guy plays for the Detroit...
[47:46.120 --> 47:46.960]  No, he doesn't.
[47:47.180 --> 47:47.600]  The Detroit Tigers.
[47:49.040 --> 47:50.180]  I mean, you'll see in a second.
[47:50.300 --> 47:50.980]  Or the Tony of the Tigers.
[47:56.260 --> 47:57.320]  It was Canadian.
[47:57.540 --> 47:58.180]  NCAP's a lot bigger.
[47:58.220 --> 47:58.980]  Oh, it is the Tigers.
[47:59.140 --> 48:00.500]  This guy plays for the puck truck.
[48:01.200 --> 48:02.200]  Or the puck train.
[48:02.380 --> 48:03.280]  Puck train, I think.
[48:05.780 --> 48:08.560]  P-O-N-C-O-B.
[48:09.240 --> 48:10.360]  Is he a puck train?
[48:13.700 --> 48:15.660]  This guy's name is...
[48:15.660 --> 48:16.060]  Don't worry about it.
[48:16.100 --> 48:17.000]  Six Pa...
[48:17.000 --> 48:17.920]  Six Pa...
[48:17.920 --> 48:19.100]  Six Pa...
[48:19.100 --> 48:19.980]  And then a ladder.
[48:20.420 --> 48:21.400]  And then three H.
[48:23.400 --> 48:25.180]  I have a friend who's Russian,
[48:25.260 --> 48:27.840]  and I'm just gonna make him watch this until he starts screaming.
[48:28.520 --> 48:33.240]  P-O-6-K-N-I-H-K-Z-M-N-E-P.
[48:35.280 --> 48:37.120]  I like when a one was in there for some reason.
[48:37.380 --> 48:40.420]  M-A-C-K-N-M-O-B.
[48:40.880 --> 48:41.560]  M-A-C-K-N-M-O-B.
[48:41.660 --> 48:42.820]  That sounds like you're saying names backwards.
[48:43.740 --> 48:44.900]  It felt like I was saying names backwards.
[48:44.900 --> 48:45.280]  Good job.
[48:45.540 --> 48:46.300]  Thank you very much.
[48:47.020 --> 48:49.120]  Thanks for sending us those cards all the way from Sweden.
[48:49.260 --> 48:50.020]  That was awesome.
[48:50.700 --> 48:52.180]  How about a palate cleanser?
[48:53.220 --> 48:53.960]  Jack, I would...
[48:53.960 --> 48:55.920]  Did you ever open those cards I got you forever ago?
[48:56.320 --> 48:56.920]  I got you, like...
[48:56.920 --> 48:59.000]  It was like Ghostbusters 2 cards or something, at Universal.
[48:59.160 --> 48:59.840]  I remember I gave them to you.
[48:59.840 --> 49:00.540]  I think they're in the back sack.
[49:00.680 --> 49:01.660]  I have opened some.
[49:01.980 --> 49:03.120]  Jack, will you hand me that right there?
[49:03.240 --> 49:03.440]  This?
[49:03.440 --> 49:03.740]  Yeah.
[49:04.180 --> 49:06.360]  We'll open up one of these so that you can see...
[49:06.360 --> 49:07.080]  Is this the wacky one?
[49:07.080 --> 49:08.300]  These are the Boosted Spring Break packs.
[49:08.420 --> 49:08.720]  Hell yeah.
[49:09.180 --> 49:11.000]  I'm going to save most of these for later.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.100]  But we're going to open one pack just so Jack can see.
[49:13.100 --> 49:14.340]  These are cool.
[49:14.620 --> 49:15.080]  These are cool.
[49:15.780 --> 49:16.840]  Here we got the Boosted.
[49:16.860 --> 49:18.840]  We opened these last time, Spring Break Edition.
[49:19.760 --> 49:20.940]  This is going to be fun.
[49:21.080 --> 49:22.020]  It's going to be different.
[49:23.040 --> 49:23.440]  Boosted.
[49:23.560 --> 49:25.120]  So these are cars that have been stolen.
[49:25.540 --> 49:26.080]  Sort of.
[49:26.240 --> 49:29.440]  I mean, you're not too far off.
[49:29.560 --> 49:30.560]  These are weird cards.
[49:31.440 --> 49:32.280]  Don't tear it up, Geoff.
[49:32.280 --> 49:33.920]  God fucking damn.
[49:33.920 --> 49:34.280]  Use the knife.
[49:34.760 --> 49:35.160]  Jesus.
[49:35.300 --> 49:36.220]  Wow, don't use the knife.
[49:36.300 --> 49:36.800]  What are you doing?
[49:38.740 --> 49:39.220]  See?
[49:39.600 --> 49:40.320]  Much safer.
[49:40.840 --> 49:41.860]  Didn't do anything.
[49:42.520 --> 49:43.220]  He didn't trust it.
[49:45.300 --> 49:47.740]  It's like I'd rather bend all of these cards than use a knife.
[49:48.380 --> 49:48.860]  Wait.
[49:49.620 --> 49:50.100]  It's...
[49:50.100 --> 49:50.540]  Perfect.
[49:51.320 --> 49:51.700]  All right.
[49:51.900 --> 49:52.600]  What do we get?
[49:52.760 --> 49:53.300]  Here we go.
[49:53.740 --> 49:54.380]  Number one.
[49:54.440 --> 49:55.240]  Oh, we haven't gotten this one yet.
[49:55.620 --> 49:57.000]  We got a...
[49:58.360 --> 49:59.320]  Neberak Ripples.
[49:59.760 --> 50:00.660]  Oh, it's Shakira.
[50:01.300 --> 50:02.640]  Shakira is about...
[50:02.640 --> 50:02.900]  Is it?
[50:03.300 --> 50:04.300]  It's Neberak Ripple.
[50:04.440 --> 50:05.280]  It is a picture of Shakira.
[50:05.380 --> 50:06.880]  Anyway, there's Shakira's driver's license.
[50:07.580 --> 50:09.160]  Where is Neberak Pimples?
[50:09.300 --> 50:10.160]  What are you talking about?
[50:12.640 --> 50:13.040]  Neberak...
[50:13.840 --> 50:14.240]  Mabarik?
[50:14.940 --> 50:15.740]  Mabarik Ripple.
[50:16.660 --> 50:16.860]  Yeah.
[50:17.960 --> 50:18.800]  Here we got a...
[50:19.280 --> 50:19.860]  Here's a...
[50:19.860 --> 50:20.520]  Is that a hotel key?
[50:21.260 --> 50:23.040]  Here's a business debit card for...
[50:23.040 --> 50:23.600]  Oh, there's probably money on it.
[50:23.600 --> 50:24.220]  Bingo Bob.
[50:24.420 --> 50:25.180]  There's probably money on this.
[50:25.240 --> 50:25.940]  We'll have to check that.
[50:26.300 --> 50:27.000]  There tends to be.
[50:27.080 --> 50:29.420]  Wait, so are these just cards that people have stolen?
[50:29.420 --> 50:30.420]  What is this?
[50:31.060 --> 50:31.780]  Spring break, maybe?
[50:32.180 --> 50:34.960]  Here's a Ultra Music Festival wrist badge.
[50:35.280 --> 50:35.660]  Get you in.
[50:35.820 --> 50:37.000]  The fuck is it?
[50:37.060 --> 50:39.720]  Is this just like people collecting shit on the beach or something?
[50:39.880 --> 50:40.640]  Here's a...
[50:40.640 --> 50:41.340]  Don't show the number.
[50:41.460 --> 50:42.640]  Here's a Venmo...
[50:42.640 --> 50:43.440]  Nice.
[50:43.800 --> 50:44.140]  Mastercard.
[50:44.360 --> 50:45.280]  Hundreds of cards.
[50:45.500 --> 50:46.200]  Drug test.
[50:46.400 --> 50:47.040]  Tile tracker.
[50:47.280 --> 50:48.580]  Taco Bell gift card.
[50:49.020 --> 50:49.080]  Yeah.
[50:49.220 --> 50:50.980]  Florida man mugshot police ticket.
[50:51.220 --> 50:51.340]  Yeah.
[50:51.480 --> 50:51.620]  Yeah.
[50:51.720 --> 50:53.600]  And then...
[50:53.600 --> 50:54.360]  USC.
[50:54.700 --> 50:55.840]  University of Southern California.
[50:55.960 --> 50:56.060]  Yeah.
[50:56.280 --> 50:56.500]  Vaccination card.
[50:56.500 --> 50:58.240]  We got Victor Sanchez's...
[50:58.900 --> 50:59.540]  Go Trojans.
[50:59.660 --> 51:00.080]  Go Trojans.
[51:00.180 --> 51:02.220]  So are these real or are they just made up?
[51:02.380 --> 51:03.440]  Go ahead and sleeve this, please.
[51:03.980 --> 51:05.360]  I don't know, but they're very expensive to buy.
[51:06.840 --> 51:09.200]  Eric, I want to do something for you.
[51:09.420 --> 51:11.220]  I know the Russian cards were technically for you.
[51:11.220 --> 51:12.220]  I'm a big fan of the Russian cards.
[51:12.240 --> 51:13.300]  I know how much you love the wrestling.
[51:13.560 --> 51:14.900]  Return to USC card services.
[51:15.020 --> 51:15.940]  Should we send this back?
[51:16.080 --> 51:17.000]  No, we should sleeve it.
[51:17.180 --> 51:17.980]  No, we should sleeve it, dude.
[51:18.020 --> 51:18.260]  Come on.
[51:18.460 --> 51:20.100]  Should we sleeve the Venmo card?
[51:20.180 --> 51:20.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:20.760 --> 51:21.660]  I'll spin that later.
[51:21.780 --> 51:21.900]  Don't worry.
[51:22.380 --> 51:23.720]  Yeah, we'll have to buy more cards with it.
[51:23.820 --> 51:25.120]  It's the only way we're making a profit here.
[51:25.240 --> 51:28.020]  Do you know how I bought that million dollar puzzle, Jack?
[51:28.020 --> 51:29.060]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:29.060 --> 51:30.280]  You got a buck for it?
[51:30.280 --> 51:30.860]  I got one dollar.
[51:31.060 --> 51:32.140]  I put this puzzle together, a million dollar puzzle.
[51:32.200 --> 51:32.740]  I won one dollar.
[51:32.820 --> 51:33.520]  It's the same people.
[51:33.760 --> 51:34.240]  Oh, okay.
[51:34.580 --> 51:34.740]  There you go.
[51:35.200 --> 51:37.200]  We're going to open up a little bit of WWE.
[51:37.720 --> 51:39.760]  All right, these are 2021, so everything's out of date.
[51:39.960 --> 51:40.680]  Everything's out of date.
[51:40.700 --> 51:41.820]  The World Wildlife Federation.
[51:42.820 --> 51:44.320]  Who's running the WWE these days?
[51:44.440 --> 51:45.160]  Triple H.
[51:45.180 --> 51:45.560]  Triple H.
[51:45.620 --> 51:46.060]  How's that going?
[51:46.440 --> 51:46.720]  It's good.
[51:47.060 --> 51:49.480]  Yeah, a lot of positive changes, fun stuff.
[51:49.600 --> 51:50.460]  I'll sleeve that one for you, Jack.
[51:50.460 --> 51:50.900]  That's a good one.
[51:52.040 --> 51:55.280]  They are doing fun stuff, interesting stuff, more wrestling.
[51:55.620 --> 51:55.660]  Slick stuff.
[51:55.860 --> 51:56.460]  Yeah, more...
[51:57.900 --> 51:59.180]  He's starting a conversation.
[51:59.860 --> 52:02.220]  Did you point out whose card this was?
[52:02.360 --> 52:02.840]  Bingo Bob.
[52:02.980 --> 52:03.740]  Bingo Bob.
[52:03.900 --> 52:04.520]  Yeah, the dog.
[52:04.880 --> 52:05.000]  Yeah.
[52:05.760 --> 52:06.700]  He can't do it.
[52:06.800 --> 52:07.240]  Can't do it.
[52:07.620 --> 52:08.000]  Walter.
[52:08.220 --> 52:12.480]  His name is Gunther now, and he is the current Intercontinental Champion.
[52:12.780 --> 52:16.220]  He is an Austrian, I guess.
[52:16.580 --> 52:17.720]  Great professional wrestler.
[52:18.180 --> 52:21.520]  Like some of the hardest chops, like chest chops in pro wrestling.
[52:21.700 --> 52:22.200]  Oh, he's awesome.
[52:22.440 --> 52:22.640]  Yeah?
[52:22.760 --> 52:24.020]  Yeah, he comes out to like...
[52:24.020 --> 52:24.520]  He's a hard chopper.
[52:24.520 --> 52:25.540]  He comes out to Dvorak.
[52:25.660 --> 52:27.360]  This whole fucking song, it was such a cool presentation.
[52:27.820 --> 52:28.480]  I love Walter.
[52:28.760 --> 52:29.240]  He is great.
[52:29.980 --> 52:35.520]  The card says that Geoff Hardy furiously attacks Sheamus, but I don't see...
[52:35.520 --> 52:37.260]  No, that's just Geoff Hardy hanging out.
[52:37.360 --> 52:39.820]  I watched Geoff Hardy jump off of...
[52:39.820 --> 52:42.540]  You ever go to the Cedar Park like arena?
[52:42.940 --> 52:43.480]  Cedar Park Center.
[52:43.640 --> 52:49.260]  Yeah, and then like in like the roundabout area outside, like, you know, like the lobby kind of area.
[52:49.400 --> 52:53.280]  There's like big windows, and then like kind of like an awning, and then like big windows.
[52:53.280 --> 52:56.380]  I watched him climb a ladder, jump off that awning onto someone through a table.
[52:56.480 --> 52:56.860]  It was pretty cool.
[52:56.920 --> 52:57.160]  Jesus.
[52:57.440 --> 52:57.640]  Oh, shit.
[52:57.720 --> 52:58.260]  Yeah, it's pretty sick.
[52:58.520 --> 52:59.360]  And live to tell the tale.
[52:59.500 --> 53:02.320]  Oh, he's got arrested for meth again, I think, recently, so...
[53:02.320 --> 53:02.460]  Ooh.
[53:03.200 --> 53:03.900]  Yeah, amphetamine's tough.
[53:03.960 --> 53:05.780]  Well, you can see he's got meth abs.
[53:06.220 --> 53:07.700]  Yeah, Sheamus is the name of his penis.
[53:09.360 --> 53:10.080]  Pete Dune.
[53:10.280 --> 53:10.640]  Pete...
[53:10.640 --> 53:11.660]  Peter Dune.
[53:11.840 --> 53:14.280]  Pete Dunne now wrestles under the name Butch.
[53:14.400 --> 53:14.860]  I don't know.
[53:16.020 --> 53:16.500]  He's weird.
[53:17.000 --> 53:18.080]  He's a great wrestler, though.
[53:18.240 --> 53:18.800]  Pete Dunne's great.
[53:19.100 --> 53:20.940]  Here we got some sort of a money bank.
[53:21.620 --> 53:22.560]  Money in the bank.
[53:22.560 --> 53:23.300]  What kind of bank is there?
[53:23.440 --> 53:23.940]  Money in the bank.
[53:24.160 --> 53:27.780]  You pull down this briefcase and then you can get a title shot anytime.
[53:27.900 --> 53:31.960]  We used to play some wrestling games back in the old days in Achievement Hunter.
[53:32.280 --> 53:33.660]  I want to do another AHW.
[53:33.840 --> 53:35.480]  I'd love to do another Achievement Hunter wrestling.
[53:36.020 --> 53:36.760]  Let's do it.
[53:37.220 --> 53:37.960]  Rob Van Dam.
[53:38.200 --> 53:39.100]  Hey, one of a kind.
[53:39.880 --> 53:42.480]  So his, you'll notice his singlet is all purple.
[53:42.920 --> 53:46.880]  It's because he has actual airbrush singlets that are done by artists.
[53:47.240 --> 53:50.260]  But because of trademarks and copyrights, they have to do that.
[53:50.600 --> 53:51.480]  Oh, that's wild.
[53:51.480 --> 53:52.880]  Oh, that's cool.
[53:52.980 --> 53:53.500]  He's pretty cool.
[53:53.580 --> 53:59.260]  Do you remember way back when The Edge challenged Randy Orton to a last man standing match at WrestleMania?
[53:59.260 --> 53:59.860]  I do.
[54:00.100 --> 54:01.140]  The basis for U2?
[54:01.280 --> 54:02.960]  Yeah, no, his name is Edge.
[54:03.000 --> 54:03.800]  He's been bulking up.
[54:04.720 --> 54:06.860]  That match wasn't very good.
[54:08.200 --> 54:10.060]  I think we all love Baron Corbin.
[54:10.180 --> 54:11.140]  Oh, we hate Baron Corbin.
[54:11.300 --> 54:11.760]  We hate Baron Corbin.
[54:11.840 --> 54:12.600]  That shame is slow.
[54:12.800 --> 54:14.160]  I had a feeling.
[54:15.300 --> 54:17.480]  I had a feeling they were going to be on the nose with that.
[54:18.740 --> 54:19.480]  Welcome to it.
[54:21.240 --> 54:23.120]  Let's continue this trip down memory lane.
[54:23.520 --> 54:24.700]  What year did we determine this one?
[54:24.840 --> 54:25.200]  2021.
[54:26.200 --> 54:27.000]  Just add a date.
[54:27.240 --> 54:27.740]  It's 2022.
[54:27.920 --> 54:28.880]  So these are the COVID cards.
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  These are the ones where they had the big digital screen behind them.
[54:32.180 --> 54:33.940]  Which is great because it's in the video game and you do that.
[54:34.060 --> 54:34.400]  It's hilarious.
[54:34.620 --> 54:34.980]  Tamina.
[54:35.040 --> 54:35.520]  Tamina Snuka.
[54:35.620 --> 54:36.320]  Jimmy Snuka's daughter.
[54:37.160 --> 54:38.880]  That's Jimmy Superfly Snuka's daughter?
[54:39.020 --> 54:39.300]  Wow.
[54:39.400 --> 54:40.620]  Got a handful of ass there.
[54:40.740 --> 54:41.040]  Hell yeah.
[54:43.400 --> 54:44.120]  Oh, here's...
[54:44.840 --> 54:46.160]  That's Shayna Baszler in the front.
[54:47.660 --> 54:48.380]  King Corbin.
[54:48.380 --> 54:49.280]  King Corbin.
[54:49.340 --> 54:50.680]  Yeah, that's Baron Corbin.
[54:50.780 --> 54:51.200]  Oh, there we go.
[54:51.240 --> 54:51.900]  But he won King of the Rain.
[54:51.980 --> 54:52.540]  Then he was King Corbin.
[54:52.780 --> 54:53.960]  I've heard you talk about this guy a lot.
[54:54.040 --> 54:54.640]  Roman Reigns.
[54:54.840 --> 54:56.360]  Yeah, he's... acknowledge him.
[54:56.420 --> 54:57.180]  He's like the guy.
[54:57.340 --> 54:58.120]  That's The Rock's cousin.
[54:58.740 --> 54:59.760]  Right, that's The Rock's cousin.
[54:59.860 --> 55:01.620]  Was he the one who was on American Gladiators?
[55:01.920 --> 55:03.220]  Or which cousin was that?
[55:03.720 --> 55:05.200]  Remember they brought back American Gladiators?
[55:05.520 --> 55:05.780]  No.
[55:06.180 --> 55:08.000]  Oh, well, they brought back American Gladiators.
[55:08.320 --> 55:09.260]  That's where...
[55:09.260 --> 55:09.900]  What's her name?
[55:10.240 --> 55:13.220]  The girl who got cancelled from Mandalorian.
[55:13.760 --> 55:14.180]  Oh, really?
[55:15.200 --> 55:16.420]  Gina Carano was on American Gladiators.
[55:16.420 --> 55:16.760]  Oh, weird.
[55:16.760 --> 55:19.420]  She was Crush on American Gladiators.
[55:19.540 --> 55:19.820]  How weird.
[55:20.220 --> 55:21.860]  Anyway, his cousin was on that show, too.
[55:22.140 --> 55:22.540]  Goldberg.
[55:22.620 --> 55:23.220]  It's Goldberg.
[55:23.400 --> 55:24.380]  He's an actor.
[55:24.880 --> 55:26.100]  Yeah, okay.
[55:26.680 --> 55:27.080]  Ricochet.
[55:27.380 --> 55:27.700]  Yeah.
[55:28.060 --> 55:29.320]  Is it Rick O'Shea?
[55:29.700 --> 55:32.160]  No, he's just Ricochet.
[55:32.700 --> 55:33.700]  He's a great wrestler, though.
[55:33.740 --> 55:34.900]  Seth Rollins.
[55:35.180 --> 55:35.500]  Hey.
[55:36.020 --> 55:39.620]  If you're Ricochet, that means you deflected off something, so you've lost a lot of your speed.
[55:39.740 --> 55:42.280]  I feel like maybe we have this person's rookie card from another break.
[55:42.440 --> 55:43.120]  Nia Jax.
[55:43.360 --> 55:43.980]  Nia Jax.
[55:44.020 --> 55:44.480]  Nia Jax.
[55:44.480 --> 55:45.300]  Yeah, she doesn't work there anymore.
[55:45.300 --> 55:46.280]  That's Jax's daughter.
[55:46.300 --> 55:46.900]  She doesn't work there anymore?
[55:47.060 --> 55:47.460]  No, not anymore.
[55:47.580 --> 55:48.840]  Yeah, Mortal Kombat daughter.
[55:50.480 --> 55:51.620]  She got a new job somewhere else?
[55:51.800 --> 55:52.200]  I don't know.
[55:52.280 --> 55:52.860]  What the fuck she's doing?
[55:52.900 --> 55:53.620]  She's not working there.
[55:54.400 --> 55:54.940]  That's weird.
[55:55.020 --> 55:56.000]  He knows where everybody works.
[55:56.140 --> 55:58.100]  I think she's anti-vaxxing.
[55:58.200 --> 55:59.880]  They just went, we travel too much for this.
[56:00.020 --> 56:00.540]  Oh, yeah.
[56:00.560 --> 56:02.300]  That's hard to...
[56:03.320 --> 56:04.040]  Drew McIntyre.
[56:04.180 --> 56:04.460]  Hey.
[56:06.280 --> 56:08.400]  He's looking at that belt very longingly.
[56:08.540 --> 56:09.180]  Yeah, he wants it.
[56:09.400 --> 56:10.360]  Slowly reading it.
[56:11.160 --> 56:11.880]  Liv Morgan.
[56:12.540 --> 56:12.880]  She's great.
[56:12.940 --> 56:13.900]  That's Fiona's friend.
[56:14.380 --> 56:14.960]  Oh, really?
[56:15.080 --> 56:16.080]  Yeah, they tweet each other all the time.
[56:16.160 --> 56:16.680]  Oh, that's cool.
[56:16.760 --> 56:19.280]  Isn't that the main character in that show with Rahul?
[56:20.660 --> 56:22.160]  Oh, it does kind of look like Liv Moore.
[56:22.460 --> 56:22.720]  Yeah.
[56:22.900 --> 56:23.480]  Oh, that's fun.
[56:23.820 --> 56:24.240]  That's cool.
[56:24.280 --> 56:24.820]  I didn't think about it.
[56:26.080 --> 56:26.800]  Karrion Kross.
[56:27.100 --> 56:27.640]  Karrion Kross.
[56:27.720 --> 56:28.900]  He got fired and then came back.
[56:29.180 --> 56:30.260]  He's got a better presentation.
[56:30.320 --> 56:31.140]  Fired, rehired.
[56:31.300 --> 56:31.560]  Yes.
[56:31.740 --> 56:32.000]  Nice.
[56:32.040 --> 56:32.360]  Good for him.
[56:32.460 --> 56:33.100]  Triple H rehired.
[56:33.320 --> 56:35.160]  Because Triple H went like, oh, this guy's money.
[56:35.500 --> 56:37.260]  This one's fucking numbered.
[56:37.460 --> 56:37.720]  Okay.
[56:38.260 --> 56:39.380]  91 of 99.
[56:39.600 --> 56:39.800]  Ooh.
[56:39.800 --> 56:44.600]  This is back when Rey Mysterio qualified for the men's money in the bank ladder match.
[56:44.620 --> 56:45.980]  Oh, hey, it's Rey Mysterio.
[56:46.300 --> 56:47.660]  So let's leave that.
[56:49.160 --> 56:50.420]  Drew McIntyre again.
[56:50.800 --> 56:51.340]  Reading slowly.
[56:51.500 --> 56:51.820]  Good job.
[56:52.020 --> 56:52.960]  Lacey Evans.
[56:53.840 --> 56:56.500]  Her finishing move, she does a big punch and she calls it the women's right.
[56:56.700 --> 56:58.120]  And I thought that was fucking great.
[56:58.260 --> 56:58.560]  That's awesome.
[56:58.700 --> 56:59.360]  That's really cool.
[57:00.360 --> 57:01.160]  Drew McIntyre.
[57:01.400 --> 57:03.820]  A lot of Drew McIntyre in this one particular pack.
[57:04.420 --> 57:05.240]  McIntyre heavy pack.
[57:05.340 --> 57:05.440]  Yeah.
[57:05.480 --> 57:06.880]  We got to get some of those AEW cards.
[57:07.000 --> 57:07.860]  Those are the ones I want to see.
[57:08.140 --> 57:08.800]  Let's get...
[57:08.800 --> 57:10.220]  I need to get some more.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.420]  Oh, is that what you were waiting for me to say?
[57:12.560 --> 57:12.660]  Yeah.
[57:13.160 --> 57:13.920]  I forgot the name of the show.
[57:14.200 --> 57:16.360]  Let's open up some UFC now that I'm a UFC guy.
[57:16.360 --> 57:16.520]  Oh, all right, cool.
[57:16.700 --> 57:18.740]  Yeah, you decided you're a UFC guy suddenly?
[57:18.880 --> 57:19.820]  I'm a UFC guy suddenly.
[57:20.100 --> 57:22.660]  I watch Dana White's Contender Series and then I watch all the UFC stuff.
[57:22.660 --> 57:23.340]  I got no problem with that.
[57:23.360 --> 57:23.620]  It's fun.
[57:23.760 --> 57:24.200]  UFC's fun.
[57:24.340 --> 57:25.120]  Who was the...
[57:25.120 --> 57:26.620]  Was it Ken Shamrock?
[57:26.760 --> 57:27.820]  Was he one of the early guys?
[57:27.840 --> 57:29.100]  He was an OG, yeah.
[57:29.100 --> 57:29.940]  He was one of the first guys.
[57:30.060 --> 57:31.120]  He was the one who wore the gi, right?
[57:31.160 --> 57:32.280]  And he would fight like in a gi.
[57:32.400 --> 57:35.040]  I have a friend who just watched the first UFC.
[57:35.040 --> 57:37.980]  He's just like, I got fucked up and I watched the first UFC.
[57:38.160 --> 57:39.600]  I didn't realize it was a tournament.
[57:39.840 --> 57:40.160]  Yeah.
[57:41.020 --> 57:41.660]  It's awesome.
[57:41.760 --> 57:43.000]  It's like Mortal Kombat.
[57:43.360 --> 57:44.220]  It really was.
[57:44.300 --> 57:45.040]  It was like Bloodsport.
[57:45.140 --> 57:47.360]  Yeah, because it was like, this guy's a sumo wrestler.
[57:47.500 --> 57:48.320]  He fucking sucks shit.
[57:48.360 --> 57:49.300]  Yeah, this guy does Kung Fu.
[57:49.520 --> 57:50.300]  Yeah, he does all that stuff.
[57:50.420 --> 57:51.940]  And then this big dude just goes...
[57:52.360 --> 57:53.700]  Oh, Kung Fu doesn't do anything.
[57:53.800 --> 57:56.460]  A Tank Abbott motherfucker just going, fuck you.
[57:56.600 --> 57:57.060]  It was awesome.
[57:57.220 --> 58:00.780]  All right, so we're going to get into some 2022 Select UFC.
[58:01.060 --> 58:01.880]  UFC 4.
[58:02.980 --> 58:03.440]  So what is this?
[58:03.440 --> 58:04.100]  This is UFC 4.
[58:04.100 --> 58:04.640]  What does that mean?
[58:04.640 --> 58:05.220]  Oh, is that four cards?
[58:05.220 --> 58:05.780]  Four cards per pack.
[58:05.940 --> 58:06.720]  Ah, there we go.
[58:07.100 --> 58:07.340]  Okay.
[58:08.460 --> 58:10.460]  Oh, this dude.
[58:11.040 --> 58:12.100]  Yeah, I'm a big fan of this dude.
[58:12.360 --> 58:13.900]  I don't know how to say his name right here.
[58:14.020 --> 58:16.260]  You recognize him because he always wears this fucking hat every time he plays.
[58:17.720 --> 58:18.360]  Murad Davlishi.
[58:19.580 --> 58:22.280]  He wears that big ass hat every time he fights.
[58:22.920 --> 58:23.860]  It's like a furry...
[58:23.860 --> 58:24.640]  They let him wear it?
[58:24.980 --> 58:25.080]  Yeah.
[58:25.080 --> 58:26.180]  He takes it off before he gets to the ring.
[58:29.580 --> 58:31.320]  Here's a rookie for Matthias Nikolu.
[58:32.440 --> 58:34.140]  Oh, this is...
[58:34.760 --> 58:38.440]  They call it Mezzanine in UFC, I guess.
[58:38.820 --> 58:39.600]  So there's different...
[58:39.600 --> 58:40.600]  See, the way these work...
[58:40.600 --> 58:41.140]  What do they call this?
[58:41.220 --> 58:41.820]  Is this concourse?
[58:42.040 --> 58:42.740]  Or they don't call it anything.
[58:42.880 --> 58:43.740]  Yeah, they call it concourse.
[58:44.200 --> 58:44.640]  So there's...
[58:44.640 --> 58:45.780]  Select cards are weird.
[58:46.200 --> 58:48.120]  Every player has like three different cards.
[58:48.200 --> 58:50.060]  And there's like base, rare, rarer.
[58:50.260 --> 58:52.360]  So this is concourse.
[58:53.180 --> 58:55.680]  And this is called Mezzanine.
[58:55.800 --> 58:56.400]  And that's rare?
[58:56.980 --> 58:57.580]  Rarer, yeah.
[58:57.620 --> 58:58.120]  And it's a rookie.
[58:58.320 --> 59:00.360]  Wait, is it the most rare or is that the second rare?
[59:00.360 --> 59:01.180]  Well, I don't know.
[59:01.280 --> 59:03.040]  Because in basketball, there's three versions.
[59:03.400 --> 59:04.260]  But in football, there's four.
[59:04.600 --> 59:06.440]  So in football, this is the second rarest.
[59:06.820 --> 59:07.080]  This is UFC, though.
[59:07.160 --> 59:08.340]  In basketball, it's the rarest.
[59:08.420 --> 59:10.240]  I've never opened these, so I just don't know.
[59:10.300 --> 59:11.740]  It's a miracle they have even two.
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.540]  I mean, in video games, orange is the rarest.
[59:15.520 --> 59:15.860]  So...
[59:15.860 --> 59:16.440]  It's true.
[59:16.500 --> 59:17.220]  Well, it depends on the video game.
[59:17.840 --> 59:20.160]  There's concourse, Yana Kunitskaya.
[59:20.340 --> 59:21.460]  And that is a...
[59:21.460 --> 59:22.120]  Do we like that?
[59:22.340 --> 59:23.160]  That is a nice card.
[59:23.240 --> 59:23.760]  That is a...
[59:23.760 --> 59:24.580]  It's a good-looking card.
[59:24.700 --> 59:25.020]  It's just...
[59:25.020 --> 59:26.780]  Is it doing anything for us, I guess?
[59:26.780 --> 59:28.340]  It's Shock Prism.
[59:28.520 --> 59:29.580]  Orange Shock Prism.
[59:29.580 --> 59:30.560]  Yeah, I like it.
[59:30.700 --> 59:31.660]  So we're gonna keep it?
[59:31.960 --> 59:32.640]  Yeah, we're gonna...
[59:32.640 --> 59:33.300]  Yeah, of course, dude.
[59:33.460 --> 59:34.000]  Look at it.
[59:34.400 --> 59:34.720]  Shock.
[59:35.580 --> 59:37.080]  Did you put any of these in the pack sack?
[59:39.540 --> 59:40.180]  Come on.
[59:40.300 --> 59:40.540]  I did.
[59:40.780 --> 59:41.140]  There you go.
[59:41.620 --> 59:43.260]  We should sleeve that, too, because that's a...
[59:43.260 --> 59:45.200]  So we just sleeve all of them?
[59:45.380 --> 59:46.720]  Anything that's a parallel, we sleeve.
[59:47.120 --> 59:48.000]  How do we know it's a parallel?
[59:48.520 --> 59:50.000]  Well, I'm not entirely sure.
[59:50.160 --> 59:51.440]  I sleeved those because they were rookies.
[59:51.640 --> 59:52.740]  We're gonna find out in this pack.
[59:52.820 --> 59:53.420]  All right, so that's a base.
[59:53.540 --> 59:54.500]  Yeah, that's what we thought.
[59:54.740 --> 59:55.600]  Am I sleeving that?
[59:55.660 --> 59:56.140]  No, no.
[59:56.200 --> 59:56.780]  There's no need to.
[59:57.900 --> 59:58.700]  Billy Quarantillo.
[59:59.960 --> 01:00:00.700]  That's a rookie.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.080]  He's involved in wrestling, not UFC.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:05.460]  Cynthia Calvillo.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.080]  Robert Whitaker.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:09.680]  And...
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.220]  Oh, is that a prism?
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:12.840]  Yeah, and then we'll sleeve this.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.840]  Vivian Araujo, and that is a prism card.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:16.240]  Nice!
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.900]  You can see the difference between a base and a prism.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.740]  See how much shinier she is?
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.840]  Yeah, you guys see that?
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.280]  I mean, they look pretty much identical.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:23.820]  These are about...
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.580]  Absolutely not.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.460]  These are about ten times rarer than these.
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.460]  They're very rare.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:28.280]  These are like...
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.500]  You get a rookie prism.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.120]  Can you pick up the other one and move it around?
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.460]  It looks...
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.160]  I guess a little bit.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.100]  There's less of a rainbow trout situation going on with the common.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.520]  A little bit of oil dip.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:39.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:40.460]  Okay.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.000]  Good pulls so far, man.
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:43.640]  This is a heavy pack.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:44.240]  Oh!
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:46.660]  This has something in it.
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:47.540]  That has a slammer.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.520]  Do you know our old accountant?
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.560]  She ran the POG account when it came to America from Hawaii.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:55.220]  What?!
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.760]  She was the CFO of POG.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:58.040]  Yeah.
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.200]  And then she came and worked for...
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:00.360]  POG's?
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.400]  POG's, whatever it's called.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:02.660]  She said that...
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:03.480]  I used to talk to her all the time about it.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.540]  She said it was the wildest nine months of her life.
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.100]  I was going to say, it had to be less than a year.
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:07.880]  It was like...
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.180]  And it was in Austin.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:10.560]  POG craze was like...
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:16.480]  It seems like a thing that started in September and then when summer came around in June,
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.140]  and I didn't have to go to school...
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:18.900]  And people moved on to magic.
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:20.740]  And everyone went, okay, goodbye.
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:22.560]  Okay, now this is an interesting card.
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:24.160]  At a POG store in Barton Creek Mall.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:28.420]  We'll sleeve it because it's a rookie, but we're also going to sleeve it because it looks like his foot is an arm.
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:29.040]  Should I sleeve it?
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.240]  Ian Gary.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.040]  It does look like his foot is an arm.
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.000]  Isn't that awesome?
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.420]  That's a good one.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.440]  Yeah, that's like an extra human.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.280]  He's got a hand foot.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:38.840]  Yeah.
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.600]  Foot and mouth disease.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:45.220]  Zhang Weilai.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.280]  Michael Chiasa.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:48.680]  Okay.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.160]  And then Jan Blakowicz.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.420]  So why was this a heavy pack?
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.140]  I don't know.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.380]  But it felt heavy, didn't it?
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:55.720]  Yeah.
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:56.940]  Oh, there's another version.
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.680]  So this is called Premier.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.160]  Okay, this is Premier and the other sports too.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.160]  So this is rarer than this, but not as rare as the club level.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.240]  Or the concourse level.
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:09.700]  So they're all named after where you can buy tickets to watch UFC?
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.280]  Like mezzanine, club, pit?
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:11.980]  I guess.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:19.440]  In the NFL, it's concourse, premier, clubhouse, and then field level.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.660]  So is there like an upper deck?
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:22.420]  Upper deck is just like shit.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.620]  Well, upper deck just makes cards.
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.240]  I usually get my tickets in the Donner's.
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:31.820]  It's the cheapest.
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:33.000]  The Fleer.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.160]  I'll be up in the Fleer's if you need me.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:40.760]  Israel Adesanya.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.120]  Yeah.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:41.820]  He's good.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:42.440]  He's real good.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.700]  That's a shiny thing, isn't it?
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.640]  He's the last stylebender.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:46.940]  Yeah.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.500]  He does like Naruto hand signs.
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:49.940]  Oh, really?
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:50.220]  Yeah.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.300]  Yeah, he's pretty cool.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.100]  I saw him fighting not too long ago.
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:54.020]  I'd call him a dork, but he would, I think, kill me.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:54.760]  Destroy you.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.320]  I think he like could without trying.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:57.840]  Michael Bisping.
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:02:58.580]  Ooh.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:03.480]  And then a rookie of Shavkat Rachmanov.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:04.900]  And he looks like he's crying.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.540]  Did Bisping come off the show?
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.480]  Was he on Ultimate Fighter?
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.040]  Michael Bisping?
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:09.500]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.180]  I think so.
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:10.440]  Let me see.
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.500]  I think he came off the show.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.820]  Can you see this please?
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:17.880]  Few things are sweeter for a fighter than avenging a high-profile loss.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:23.260]  For Michael, the Count Bisping, that moment came when he met Dan Henderson at UFC 204.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:27.940]  Evening the score from their previous bout way back at UFC 100.
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:29.500]  Jesus Christ.
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.180]  God damn, he's been out for a while.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:30.940]  Yeah.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:31.620]  All right.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:32.540]  That's too long.
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:33.140]  That's too long.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:34.340]  That's a lot of getting punched.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.160]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.220]  Was it Forrest Griffin?
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:37.560]  Was that a fighter?
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.140]  Yeah.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:42.140]  There was one, I think it was the UFC fighting, the TV shows, I think the second season.
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.820]  You might be thinking of Peter Griffin or Forrest Whitaker.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.220]  He's thinking of Peter Griffin.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.020]  He's thinking of the family.
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:47.100]  Yeah.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.860]  No, it was like the fight.
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:49.720]  Holy crap.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.300]  It was like the last two guys would fight each other.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:52.460]  Yeah.
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:55.320]  And it went in a full three or five rounds, whatever they did for that one.
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.040]  And it was one of the most amazing fights ever.
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:57.940]  And they gave both contracts.
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:58.840]  Fighting for their lives.
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:03:59.520]  Here we go.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.120]  All right, what do we got?
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.700]  Everybody knows this guy.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.640]  Kamzat Shimeev, who I think didn't make weight for his fight a couple weeks ago.
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:07.000]  Sounds right.
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:07.580]  Or something.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.060]  He is supposedly...
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:09.960]  I've seen him fight a few times.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.200]  He's unbeatable.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.220]  They have a lot of problems with that in UFC right now.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:13.500]  Yeah.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.220]  There's a lot of making weight problems.
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:18.800]  Yeah, they change their thing where it's like you have to weigh in at a certain time.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.080]  And it's closer to the fight or something.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.080]  So you're trying to put weight back on.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:23.880]  But you're trying to...
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.600]  It's just fucked.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.140]  That's nuts.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.660]  But it's healthier.
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:30.800]  It's healthier than what they were doing before where people would just go and dehydrate.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.500]  I want to say...
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.920]  Probably 15 pounds before the fight.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:34.920]  I might be getting this wrong.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.560]  So in the audience, let me know if I'm getting it wrong.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.520]  But I want to say he was supposed to fight Nate Diaz.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.500]  And he didn't make weight.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.040]  And then Nate Diaz had to fight somebody else.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.900]  And then on one day notice, and then Nate Diaz retired after it.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:44.140]  Yeah.
[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.320]  Bilal Muhammad.
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:46.640]  Oh shit, there we go.
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.600]  Nate Diaz.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:48.060]  Yeah!
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:51.280]  Who is the toughest dude ever to have a dad bod.
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:52.300]  So cool.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.300]  Looks like he has a fanny pack.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.060]  So cool.
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:55.220]  You're never going to believe this.
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:56.540]  This guy smokes weed.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.800]  And this guy is an Inland Empire guy.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.240]  I was about to say, this dude is like...
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.580]  Nate Diaz seems like the guy who came out of everything that you tell me about Queens of the Stone Age.
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:04.880]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.580]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.780]  This guy listens to Caius on the regular.
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:09.580]  100%.
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:10.360]  Oh, this is a cool card.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.580]  I think he's from Sacramento.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.040]  And you can look at him and be like, yeah, fuck yeah, he is.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:16.420]  Jiri Brokazka.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:18.660]  Global icons.
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:20.880]  And this apparently is a silver shock.
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:21.520]  Wow.
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.440]  That's a fucking cool card.
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:24.520]  We're rich.
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:25.860]  That is a really cool card.
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.300]  The hard sleeve?
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.880]  It's got a fucking print line on it.
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.280]  That sucks.
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:31.820]  There you go.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.600]  That will not grade out at 10.
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:35.900]  Yeah, go ahead and sleeve that.
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.020]  Do you want a hard sleeve for it or just the normal sleeve?
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:38.840]  Just the normal sleeve is fine.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.700]  How much time we doing on time, Eric?
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.940]  We got about 15 minutes left.
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:42.820]  15 minutes left.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.240]  Let's get into what you've been excited about.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.800]  Garbage Pail Kids, hell yeah.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.780]  I had to go all the way to the baseball club store to buy these.
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.720]  $99.95 on the bottom.
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:52.980]  Yeah, I paid $100 for these.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:53.520]  Wow.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720]  These are so...
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.820]  Are these valuable at all?
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.280]  I mean, are these worth anything?
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.040]  They're worth about $100.
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:02.200]  But see, it says 1986 original series.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:05.220]  Is this a reprint or is this literally from 1986?
[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:06.460]  This is a reprint.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.200]  This is a chrome reprint.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:10.440]  These I hate.
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:13.300]  So what are the ones we're looking for?
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.740]  Fuck if I know, I don't collect these.
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:16.460]  I just got them because they're fun.
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.680]  So 1986, there's gonna be a lot of Reagan.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.440]  We're looking for...
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.000]  100%.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.180]  We're looking for a variety of exclusive colored chrome parallels.
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:23.000]  That's what we want.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.320]  So a Gorbachev reference probably.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:27.920]  Gorba-barf.
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:29.480]  That's about as clever as it gets.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.180]  I fucking hate Gorbachev.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.040]  It's Gorbachev.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.260]  It's like Barry Bob.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.980]  Barry Berlin Wall.
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:37.800]  That's about what we'll be on here for.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:38.800]  You're not far off.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.580]  Marty Grass.
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:42.060]  These suck.
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.740]  This is Eric in high school.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:46.820]  Bank Jake.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.180]  He's in the desert, but I think it's a weed reference.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:52.340]  I don't think it is.
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:54.580]  Sean Sean.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.220]  He shaved his whole fucking face off.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.320]  And then, here we go.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.560]  Amazing Grace.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.700]  Oh, this is 190 of 199, by the way.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.820]  This has the thing on the back where you can collect them all and make a big one.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.240]  Big poster.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:10.700]  I remember those when I was collecting them as a child.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:11.440]  We'll try to do that.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:11.940]  Great.
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:13.040]  Yeah, we'll do that.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:14.420]  Here we go.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:15.860]  Bushy Bernice.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:16.900]  A lot of hair stuff.
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:21.080]  Oh, you might want to take this into the dark movie theater with you.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:21.260]  Yeah, sure.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.080]  Foxy Francis.
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:23.700]  Okay.
[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.860]  And I believe this is a purple parallel.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:26.540]  Wow.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:27.480]  Oh, yeah.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:28.240]  Numbered...
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.140]  Oh, shit, guys.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.620]  This is...
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.040]  It's numbered 250, but this is number one.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:33.960]  Oh, boy.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.420]  Number one of 250.
[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:37.000]  Not very often you see number one.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:37.840]  There you go.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.060]  Is a number one worth more than a number 12 or something, or does it matter?
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:43.140]  If...
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:44.120]  Not for her.
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:48.580]  But if it were, like, LeBron, maybe, it'd be worth a couple bucks more.
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:49.900]  Yitchy Mickey.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:50.960]  Yicky Mickey.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:53.060]  And then Harry Heriot again.
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:55.420]  Just, like, not even getting that.
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:57.420]  Not even the realm.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:57.960]  Nuh-uh.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.080]  I love what Eric hates.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.380]  I don't know why.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.160]  These suck.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:04.300]  Hunted Hunter.
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:05.060]  Get it?
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.520]  Oh, shit.
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:08.240]  We got a prism here.
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:09.780]  Sorry.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.320]  A refractor, because it's tops.
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.880]  Crystal Gale.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:18.940]  Now, this is Crystal Gale, the melting snowman, not to be confused with the country singer.
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:19.720]  Cool.
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:21.180]  Look at that.
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:22.300]  Wow.
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:22.620]  Pretty.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:23.820]  There you go.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.540]  Whisper and Woody.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.560]  And then...
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:27.840]  Oh!
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.600]  Reese Pieces.
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:31.940]  He's a puzzle.
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:33.380]  He's a little puzzle.
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:35.700]  These pieces are going to fall apart.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.320]  It says peeled here.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.200]  Are these actual stickers?
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:39.020]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:40.760]  Do you want to...
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:40.920]  Nope.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.440]  Crystal Gale, which is her base card.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:44.960]  Wow!
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.000]  Now we see the difference.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:47.640]  Brolic Beth.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.380]  That's the same as the other...
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.960]  That's Amazing Grace or whatever.
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:53.700]  It's, like, way down there.
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:54.240]  You have to look.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.200]  It's way, way down.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:55.620]  Keep going.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.260]  You're almost there.
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:56.600]  Keep going.
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:57.460]  Right there.
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:08:59.460]  These cards suck.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:00.200]  Motherfucker.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.000]  These cards suck.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:01.960]  They're rad dude-ness.
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:02.460]  Yeah.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.060]  These cards suck.
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:03.680]  They're fucking rad dude-ness.
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.300]  So it's the same art, just different name.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.600]  Mecha Mike.
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:07.360]  Yeah, these cards suck.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:08.460]  That one's cool.
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:09.460]  That is cool.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.280]  He's a big robot.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:16.180]  And then, Stuffed Steven.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:16.820]  That one sucks.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.460]  These cards suck.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:20.680]  Yeah, sure.
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:21.360]  We'll open up one more.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:21.580]  Yeah!
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:22.760]  Nice.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.160]  Now I can tell Eric wants to.
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:25.600]  He was asking about it.
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:25.940]  Yeah.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:27.420]  All right.
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.860]  We should get into the pack sack after this.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.660]  You should, like, dig deep.
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:30.920]  You should go, like, wrist deep in the pack sack.
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.260]  I'm going to go wrist deep in the pack sack.
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:35.720]  All right.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:36.040]  Here we go.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:36.400]  What do we got?
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:36.800]  Anything good?
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:37.680]  Oh, you're going to love this one.
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:38.660]  You're going to love this one.
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:39.560]  Nailed Neil.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:44.760]  Flat Tyler.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:46.900]  All right, that's kind of cool.
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:48.140]  All right.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.240]  Well, this is going to piss you off.
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.080]  This is going to piss you off a lot.
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:51.960]  Spikey Mikey.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:53.960]  It's the same thing!
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:55.780]  I think it said they get two names.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.080]  Like, there's 155A and 155B.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.260]  Because they were like, we had more names than we had people.
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:00.800]  Wow.
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:02.060]  We're so clever.
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.240]  We need to do different names on these things.
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.080]  Double Iris.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.680]  She's got four eyes.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:09.000]  Creepy.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.100]  I wonder if there's another one that's, like, four Iris.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:11.560]  Yes.
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:14.000]  All right.
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.440]  You wanted to go deep in the pack sack.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:15.640]  Yeah.
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:16.180]  Deep in the sack.
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:16.960]  I want to see what you got.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.500]  Show me what you got.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:21.600]  All right.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.220]  Tops football.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:22.920]  Tops football.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:23.340]  Okay.
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:24.660]  Might be able to toss baseball.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.980]  Might be able to get a Zim.
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:26.680]  Might get a Zim.
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.300]  I forgot.
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.160]  I didn't realize I didn't bring anything for Zim.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:31.040]  And...
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:32.660]  What the...
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:32.980]  Oh!
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.720]  Remember those?
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.260]  We opened these a while back.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.220]  Somebody sent us these.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.700]  These are professional ultimate Frisbee cards.
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:42.480]  Oh, that's right!
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:43.720]  We're trying to pull...
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.340]  The one we're looking for in here is Caleb.
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:46.320]  Caleb Denikler.
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:49.400]  He probably has a card.
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:50.540]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.620]  Definitely not in this pack.
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.300]  He certainly deserves it.
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:52.800]  There's a checklist.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.960]  We got Kona Star Penis.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.620]  Rebecca Cox.
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:57.520]  Oh, it's all sex-based.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.040]  Alexis...
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:01.080]  Go ahead.
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:01.420]  Go ahead.
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:02.380]  Make something out of that.
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:02.840]  No.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:04.900]  Ella Hansen.
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:05.780]  Ella Han stuff.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:07.940]  James Conrad.
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.580]  Ezra Adderhold, my nuts.
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:12.660]  Thomas Gilbert.
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:14.740]  Raven Newsome.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.780]  Casey White.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.660]  Mason Ford.
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:19.320]  Wow.
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:20.780]  These people are fucking...
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:22.760]  Mason Ford sounds like someone who'd be a...
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.340]  These are...
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:25.340]  Mason Ford seems like where you would buy...
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.060]  A Ford.
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:28.460]  Yeah, a Ford.
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.500]  You guys got that monkey?
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:29.880]  An F-150.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.180]  Come on down to Mason Ford!
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.200]  Mason Ford.
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:35.500]  All your Ford and Ford property thing needs.
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:36.720]  Terry Roethlisberger.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.100]  Probably related to Ben.
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:38.600]  Wow, big Ben?
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.480]  There's only a couple Roethlisbergers.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.460]  And then the annual charity open Progedy Disc card.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.760]  Yeah, so we got some of those.
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:46.680]  Those are awesome.
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.640]  What are the odds that you've broken something that's super valuable but you guys had no idea?
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:50.960]  Decent.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:51.440]  Yeah?
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:51.560]  Yeah.
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:52.200]  Probably.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:53.820]  I would think so.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:54.500]  There's a lot.
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:55.700]  Had a lot.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.340]  1981 tops football.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:57.580]  Okay.
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:58.280]  I'm excited about this.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.500]  Who was a rookie in 91?
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:00.820]  Jesus, dude.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:01.980]  Icky Woods?
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:03.340]  Oh, dude.
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.460]  When did Aikman start?
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:05.940]  Later than that.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:06.880]  Like 90...
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:07.900]  No, not that much later.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:08.640]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:09.740]  No, he wouldn't have been...
[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:10.140]  89.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:12.020]  I would say he wouldn't have been...
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:12.220]  That's not too far off.
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.480]  He wouldn't be a rookie, but we can...
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.040]  Okay, here we go.
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:15.340]  Okay.

[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:21.460]  Nice Oilers.
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:22.060]  I love that Oilers.

[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:25.300]  Paul Gruber.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.240]  No relation to Hans.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:28.840]  Jim Breach.
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:30.820]  Andre Reid.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.680]  Looking like he's having a bad day.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:34.880]  Yeah, he's not happy about it.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.280]  He's a little frustrated.
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:36.200]  Jack, why don't you...
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:36.680]  We'll save that.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:37.020]  I like that.
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:37.920]  Woo-hoo.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:40.840]  Roger Ruzek.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.500]  He didn't point out the little cut he's got in his hair.
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.440]  He's got a little lightning bolt in his hair.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.240]  Oh, he does.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:51.940]  Bruce Hill.

[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:02.780]  What is that 49ers logo?
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.880]  Oh, no, it's a college card.
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:06.480]  It's college and...
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.920]  No, but even like the font.
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:08.820]  Oh, no, they're all like that.
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:09.340]  They're all like that.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:09.900]  Oh, okay.
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:11.340]  It's just the style.
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:13.820]  I think he was...
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:14.960]  This guy was in ET, right?
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:15.500]  Henry Thomas?
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.180]  Mm-hmm.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:16.760]  Yeah.
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:18.160]  That's Elliot.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.680]  Pete Stoyanovich.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:22.520]  Kent Hull.
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:26.540]  Irv Panky.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:30.180]  Albert Benthefei.
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:30.960]  Great.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.100]  And Anthony Bell.
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:32.920]  Fucking nobody.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.500]  You got nothing in these cards, man.
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:35.100]  Sucky.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.300]  Pac-Sac not coming through today.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.860]  Pac-Sac did not come through on that one.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.260]  Not coming through today on the Pac-Sac.
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:40.660]  Woof.
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:41.200]  Where's the gun?
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.100]  It's right here.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.340]  Can I get it?
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:45.020]  Sure.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:45.720]  Yeah, dude.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:46.600]  We've all done it.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.360]  It's true.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:47.680]  We have.
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:48.380]  Give him the gum.
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:49.920]  There you go, bud.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:51.000]  All right.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:51.780]  Looking for a Zim.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:52.620]  Looking for a Zim.
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:53.440]  Looking for a Zim.
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:54.200]  Looking for a Zim.
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:54.880]  Big Zim energy.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:55.480]  Big Zim energy.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.660]  Dickie Thawne.
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:57.780]  Oh, God.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:58.720]  Greg Catteret.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.220]  You hear that?
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:13:59.760]  Yeah.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:00.680]  Eat that gum, baby.
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:02.540]  Bob Green.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.020]  Chomp down.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.420]  Charlie Hayes.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:05.940]  Down the hatch.
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:07.200]  Oh, God.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:07.880]  Oh, dude.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:09.380]  Darren Thornton.
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.740]  That's so loud.
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:11.800]  Brooke Jacobi.
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:12.900]  I can hear it over here.
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:14.080]  Another Carlton Fisk.
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.060]  That's two Carlton Fisks today.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:16.960]  Danny Jackson.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.920]  When did it become gum?
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.420]  I think it's about to turn into mud, bro.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:22.440]  About 18 years ago.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.660]  Jamie Quirk, the most famous Oakland A.
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:26.960]  I think it becomes gum in 1990.
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:28.900]  Oh, now it tastes like just dirt.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:29.180]  Yeah.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:30.480]  Kasey Kandell.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.080]  It tastes like old.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.400]  Roy Smith.
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:34.680]  We didn't get a single fucking...
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.680]  No, we didn't get shit, man.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:36.340]  Manager card.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.060]  Randy Bush.
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:38.540]  Wes Chamberlain.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.620]  Sean Boskey.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:40.120]  What do we do?
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.120]  We go back into the pack sack?
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.700]  Like, we got a couple minutes left, and we got to get something.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:44.060]  We have to end this.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:47.900]  It tastes like a high school library.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.400]  That's a good way to put it.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:54.260]  We're going to end right here, and if we still have time, we'll open another box of Prism,
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:57.340]  because it's been driving me fucking crazy not to be able to open it.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:58.480]  All right.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.780]  How many packs are in this?
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.860]  This is going to be, I believe, six packs, four cards each.
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:03.400]  Wow.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:04.340]  Let's do it.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:05.340]  Cool.
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:06.320]  Impossible.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.660]  I believe this box of Prism comes to us from Detroit.
[01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:11.360]  My girlfriend picked it up in Detroit.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:16.380]  We have to get a good pack to end on for The Break Show, the name of this show.
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:18.300]  Not the...
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.160]  Face Break Shit.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:20.560]  Thank you.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:21.420]  Yeah, no, I got you, bud.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:22.660]  We'll go to the pack sack?
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:23.980]  Busy thinking about Detroit or whatever.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:25.520]  All right.
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:27.680]  So, chase cards in this?
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:27.960]  Yeah.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.880]  We're going to be looking for Kate Cunningham.
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:31.660]  We're going to be looking for Evan Mobley.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.140]  We're going to be looking for Scotty Barnes.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.460]  This is just basketball?
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:34.980]  We're going to be looking for Jalen Greene.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:35.900]  This is just NBA basketball.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.060]  Oh, then we're looking for Pat Bev.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.880]  We'll be looking for Pat Bev.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.100]  We'll be definitely looking for Pat Bev.
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:42.340]  Mobley was the character from Jungle Book, right?
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:43.560]  Yes, Evan Mobley was in Jungle Book.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.440]  Evan Mobley.
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:45.600]  Miles Turner.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.020]  Okay.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:48.700]  Luka Doncic.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.460]  The hip mic is over.
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:54.600]  Every time, if you guys don't know, every time somebody who went to UT has shown mic,
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:57.760]  our sound guy just goes, oh, and he throws up the horn.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:58.500]  TJ Ford.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:15:59.820]  Nicholas Claxton.
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:03.700]  And, oh, a dominance for Zion Williams.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.540]  Oh, nice.
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:05.300]  Brandon Mouton.
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:06.900]  So, we'll go ahead and sleeve that.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:07.380]  I like that.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:08.020]  Zion's cool.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:08.600]  Love Zion.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:09.760]  Love it if he played.
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:12.420]  Would be great if he did, right?
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.260]  He's the one who blew up his shoe, right?
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:16.280]  Yeah, he blew out his Nike in college.
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:18.420]  Marvin Bagley.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.660]  David Johnson rookie.
[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:21.780]  Aaron Nesmith.
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.740]  No longer plays for the Celtics.
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.700]  He's a San Antonio Spurnow, I believe.
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:27.600]  And Vince Carter.
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:28.360]  Oh, wow.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:28.940]  Really?
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:29.940]  Yeah, Vince Carter.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.620]  Is it USA basketball, Vince Carter?
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:32.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:35.940]  They have like a USA basketball insert set.
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:38.760]  Vince Carter, who is famous for a lot of things.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.920]  But quite possibly the most devastating in-game dunk of all time.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:45.900]  Hard to find.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.340]  You think Shaq tearing down the rim?
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:49.940]  Like, destroying the backboard?
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:51.100]  No, he killed a dude, though.
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:51.960]  Shaq didn't hurt anybody.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.060]  Like, you'd have to see it.
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:54.660]  It was in Team USA.
[01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:57.320]  And it's so brutal, it's hard to find.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:02.380]  People are talking, like, posterizing someone is just, like, going through them in, like, this dunk.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.360]  He, like, kills someone.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:04.640]  It's sad.
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:05.480]  It's gnarly.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.000]  Nobody ever saw the dude again.
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:09.040]  He, like, put a knee in his face or something?
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.260]  It's the most brutal dunk on someone ever.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.220]  It's just, like, disrespectful.
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:14.820]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:16.260]  Rudy Gobert.
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:17.980]  Maxi Kleber.
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:19.440]  Geoff's favorite player.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.020]  Kyrie Irving.
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:21.800]  Sleeve it!
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:24.640]  Kyrie Irving, cracked ice parallel.
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.360]  Hell, yeah.
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:26.320]  Geoff's favorite guy.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.760]  If we sleeve this thing, Geoff loves this guy.
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:29.300]  You know it.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.840]  He's got to keep that Kyrie card.
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.480]  Kyrie Irving, who admitted that he gave up $100 million...
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:34.560]  Kyrie!
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.740]  ...because he didn't want to get a fucking shot.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:39.680]  Truly, truly making himself a martyr for the cause.
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:40.720]  Thank you, Kyrie.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.800]  He was one of the flat earthers, right?
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:45.200]  Oh, Kyrie's a flat earther.
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:46.560]  He's an anti-vaxxer.
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:52.720]  He's just going, like, see, vaccine mandates are being lifted everywhere.
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:53.580]  You're welcome.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.140]  I was the one who sat out, and it's like, that's right.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:57.100]  I'm welcome.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.880]  Way to go, Kyrie.
[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:02.560]  Supposedly, James Harden, when James Harden...
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.160]  He was having trouble.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.000]  On Brooklyn.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:10.040]  And supposedly, he was sitting courtside, pre-game, getting ready,
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.440]  and he saw Kyrie smudging the court, and he was like,
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:14.400]  I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:15.640]  Like, that was the moment that broke him.
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:16.660]  He was like, I gotta get away from this dude.
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.080]  I just want to put that down.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.680]  Like, smudge stick smudging the court?
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:19.960]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:20.480]  Wow.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.560]  Jason Preston.
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:23.800]  Why doesn't he have a Spider-Man logo behind him?
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:24.980]  Well, he's Spider-Man.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:25.380]  It does, kind of.
[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:25.760]  Okay.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.400]  D'Angelo Russell.
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:29.760]  Nobody likes D'Angelo Russell, but he's a good player.
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:30.260]  That's cool.
[01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:33.860]  He's famous for...
[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:38.640]  He's the one who outed, who posted the video,
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:39.880]  I think it was on Instagram or Snapchat,
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:43.980]  of Nick Young bragging about cheating on...
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:45.140]  Oh, I remember that.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:46.960]  Iggy Azalea.
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:47.580]  Yeah, I remember that.
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:48.840]  And he got traded.
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:49.400]  He was a Laker.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:51.400]  He got traded to the fucking Knicks after that.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.200]  Or not the Knicks, the Nets.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.020]  Who's the best number zero in any sport?
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:54.940]  Jason Tatum.
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:55.460]  Okay.
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:56.640]  DeAndre Hunter.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:58.840]  That is a green parallel.
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.820]  Well, and then Jarrett Allen, who...
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:02.420]  Hey, cool guy.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.320]  Kind of friendly around Rooster Teeth.
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.340]  We like Jarrett Allen.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.160]  He's a...
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.760]  Talked about him before, but Benjamin Razor.
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:11.640]  He's a video game dude.
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:12.240]  Really cool dude.
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:12.780]  Yeah, cool guy.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.920]  Seen him interact with Gavin on social media.
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:16.860]  Who was the guy you went out and interviewed?
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:17.820]  Anthony Davis.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:18.380]  Anthony Davis.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.280]  Big AD, huh?
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:19.900]  Big AD.
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.800]  Tried to convince him to join the Celtics.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:23.640]  Pat Bev?
[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:24.960]  I don't know.
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:25.720]  I don't know who it is.
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.800]  But we got a huge parallel.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:28.160]  Really?
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:29.620]  We got a huge parallel.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:30.820]  Okay, here we go.
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:30.880]  Huge parallel.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:30.920]  Here we go.
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:32.500]  This is the streamender.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.700]  World famous actor Amari Stoudemire, who's great in Trainwreck.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:38.760]  Everybody loved him in that.
[01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:40.140]  LeBron is great in Trainwreck.
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:41.780]  Isaiah Jackson.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.200]  Okay.
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:45.860]  We have a Chris Paul.
[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:46.660]  Nice.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:47.020]  CP3.
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.560]  And then...
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:53.120]  So, because it's the 75th year of the NBA, they created two different parallels.
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:54.160]  A blue and a red.
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:55.000]  The blue is in retail.
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:55.820]  The red is in hobby.
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:58.300]  It's called the 75th anniversary parallel.
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:01.280]  There is about two per case.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:01.660]  Okay.
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:03.760]  And that's what it looks like.
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:05.000]  Oh, you got...
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:05.580]  Quentin Grimes.
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:05.940]  Oh, cool.
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:12.480]  So, not necessarily the rookie you'd want to get, but still an incredibly rare, incredibly
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.080]  nice, and then also very well-centered.
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:17.960]  Prism is famous for having shit centering.
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:20.160]  You can even see...
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:20.660]  Looks good.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:21.280]  Chris Paul's off.
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:22.580]  That is an awesome card.
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:26.680]  Jack, if you could very carefully sleeve that for me, and then put it in a top letter as well.
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:27.240]  Now, here's the thing.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:27.900]  I would appreciate that.
[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:28.260]  Here's the thing.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.820]  We can end on that.
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:30.960]  We can end on...
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:31.760]  Wow, what a great parallel.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.280]  We have one more pack of those that we could...
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.460]  You could just open the other one.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.000]  I could just slip this in the bottom of it.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.360]  You could do it right now, Geoff.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.360]  And we could end it on two Prism packs.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:42.100]  Can you believe that?
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:42.720]  I would love to.
[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:43.780]  And that's...
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:46.120]  And that's what I'm talking about for the break show, guys.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:46.600]  This is...
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.780]  You can go for it.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:51.580]  Not to be confused with fuck-faced break shit.
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:52.880]  No, which is the old...
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:53.380]  Which is the old...
[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:53.840]  Yeah.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:54.480]  Old and busted.
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:55.260]  Yeah.
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.700]  This is new hotness.
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:57.240]  This is new hotness.
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:58.180]  Yeah, this is new hotness.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.320]  So how much is this worth?
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:00.760]  Oh, shit.
[01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:01.500]  You know what I realized?
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:03.440]  $150,000?
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:05.240]  I don't know.
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.060]  Dude, we can get another season of Haunter with this.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:07.980]  It's probably worth...
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:09.860]  Dude, I pulled a $200 LeBron parallel.
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:10.280]  Hell yeah.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:11.220]  There you go.
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:11.700]  There's Haunter.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:12.960]  All right, so what's this called, Geoff?
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:14.060]  That is...
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:16.420]  Dude, Quentin Grimes Prism 75th parallel.
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:18.120]  Hang on, I gotta get off my wordle.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:21.560]  Quentin...
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.440]  75th anniversary Prism parallel.
[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:27.340]  75th anniversary...
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:27.440]  Prism.
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:27.940]  Prism Middleton.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:30.060]  I'm gonna guess it's...
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:32.020]  Prism what?
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:32.960]  Prism...
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:33.240]  Parallel.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:33.920]  Parallel.
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.400]  Probably somewhere between $40 and $100.
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:36.960]  Nice.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.940]  I don't know what the market for Quentin Grimes is.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.840]  On eBay, this card right here is currently listed for $60.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:44.580]  Hey!
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.540]  It got one for $60.
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:47.780]  Tracy McGrady.
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:48.680]  Really?
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:50.560]  Yeah, TMAC.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.200]  Old TMAC.
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:52.320]  Here we go.
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:53.640]  Prism parallel, Monte Morris.
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:55.600]  Once again, awesome parallel.
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:56.300]  Super rare.
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:59.040]  Would be cooler if it was somebody cooler than...
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:21:59.740]  Somebody else.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:00.640]  Monte Morris.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:00.960]  But whatever.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.920]  And then a Thaddeus Young cracked ice.
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:05.100]  So we'll sleeve that too.
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:06.500]  That's cool.
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:07.020]  It's okay.
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:07.960]  It's fine.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:08.480]  It's okay.
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:09.740]  He's fine.
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:11.560]  Oh, you know what we gotta do is we gotta...
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.360]  Wow, you're gonna pack sack one?
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.040]  Got to.
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:14.480]  Okay.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:16.900]  It might be the last one we open, huh?
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:17.440]  Yeah.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:17.840]  Yeah.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:20.840]  All right.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:21.760]  Here we go.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:22.640]  Devante Graham.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.500]  These have been in my fucking house for so long.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:25.940]  It's like...
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:27.300]  It's like...
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:30.940]  What I imagine it must be like to be a drug dealer who also likes drugs.
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:31.900]  You know?
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.820]  It's just like fucking staring into my office every week.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.900]  When do I get to open this up again?
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:40.420]  Hakeem Olajuwon.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.020]  Hakeem Green.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:41.340]  Hey, all right.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:42.660]  Oh, shit.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:43.100]  Back to back.
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:43.980]  Hakeem Green parallel.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:44.380]  Wow.
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:45.440]  That's an awesome card, actually.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:46.280]  Double Hakeems.
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:50.660]  And then a Jalen Johnson crack dice parallel rookie.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.940]  Grab a sleeve of that as well.
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:52.960]  Did a...
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:55.760]  I was telling you about that thing that my wife started on TikTok.
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:58.300]  I'd just give her a big three, like a famous big three.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:04.380]  And I did Charles Barkley Scottie Pippen Hakeem Olajuwon when it was like the 99 Rockets
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:06.980]  because they just famously did not work.
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:10.340]  When I gave her the signs, she was just like, this is a fucking mess.
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:11.760]  That's awesome.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:12.420]  Hell yeah.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:13.760]  Thaddeus Young.
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.460]  Ooh, Davion Mitchell rookie card.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.900]  Now, talk about poorly cut.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.360]  Do you see how poorly cut this is?
[01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:20.560]  Yeah, it looks like shit.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.220]  How off-centered it is?
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:24.460]  This could never rate higher than a nine because of that, unfortunately.
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:25.840]  That's a seven if I've ever seen it.
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:27.200]  Sucks for a fucking rookie card.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.220]  Davion Mitchell's pretty good, too.
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:33.220]  Although he's playing for the Kings, so he's got a life of obscurity.
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:33.500]  Yeah.
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:36.260]  Well, the Quentin Grimes love keeps going.
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:36.740]  Wow, just really?
[01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:40.140]  So we got the Quentin Grimes purple...
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:41.480]  What kind of parallel is this called?
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.280]  I don't know what you're looking for, man.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:45.120]  The box?
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:45.840]  Freaking out, man.
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:48.480]  That is the...
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:57.680]  Purple Wave.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.000]  Purple Wave.
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:23:59.760]  Purple Wave, I knew that.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:01.180]  Just leave it for me.
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:01.500]  Yeah, please.
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:03.580]  And Ben Simmons, Global Reach.
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:05.300]  Womp, womp, womp.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:05.980]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:24:09.930 --> 01:24:10.950]  Trust the process, Geoff.
[01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:14.070]  Ben Simmons is the setup and the punchline.
[01:24:16.190 --> 01:24:17.150]  Joe Harris.
[01:24:17.650 --> 01:24:18.590]  That rules.
[01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:21.510]  Moses Brown, who played for the Celtics for a week.
[01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:23.370]  Why is there an OU logo behind him?
[01:24:25.530 --> 01:24:28.270]  Because he's playing in the Oklahoma City Thunder?
[01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:28.950]  Probably.
[01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:30.210]  Do they share a stadium?
[01:24:30.490 --> 01:24:30.770]  At OU?
[01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:31.170]  Norman?
[01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:33.230]  I don't know.
[01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.890]  I live in Texas.
[01:24:34.090 --> 01:24:34.930]  But it's fucking basketball.
[01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:35.710]  You know basketball.
[01:24:36.090 --> 01:24:36.550]  I don't know.
[01:24:36.970 --> 01:24:37.910]  They do not share a stadium.
[01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:39.190]  Thanks, Mike.
[01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:40.810]  KG.
[01:24:41.230 --> 01:24:43.730]  This is what pisses me off about these classic KG cards.
[01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:44.610]  I get it.
[01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:45.250]  I get it.
[01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:46.070]  I get it.
[01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:47.950]  But it's always a fucking Timberwolves card.
[01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:48.990]  Never a Celtics card.
[01:24:49.010 --> 01:24:50.170]  It's always going to be the one.
[01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:51.070]  There was how many...
[01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:52.610]  He won a fucking title with us!
[01:24:52.650 --> 01:24:52.810]  That's true.
[01:24:53.150 --> 01:24:53.690]  That's true.
[01:24:54.630 --> 01:24:59.030]  I don't think that that's what people remember him as.
[01:24:59.130 --> 01:24:59.470]  I know.
[01:24:59.570 --> 01:25:00.210]  Bam on a bio.
[01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:02.190]  Miami Heat dominance.
[01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:02.990]  I have...
[01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.510]  This is the one.
[01:25:03.690 --> 01:25:04.350]  This is the last pack.
[01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:07.650]  I have one of those trio astrology sign things.
[01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:10.970]  And it's the Celtics with KG.
[01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:11.910]  Oh, with KG and Paul Pierce.
[01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:13.690]  I haven't done it yet with her, but...
[01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:16.610]  There you go.
[01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:17.930]  I think she's going to go...
[01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:19.290]  This could go really right or really wrong.
[01:25:19.450 --> 01:25:19.590]  Oh.
[01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:20.190]  That'll be right.
[01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:24.110]  Speaking of that era of Celtics, here's my once favorite basketball player, Jean Rondeau.
[01:25:24.130 --> 01:25:25.770]  I was going to guess.
[01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:26.630]  Love Rondeau.
[01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:27.470]  Love Rondeau.
[01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:30.830]  Wasn't crazy about the time he spit in Chris Paul's face.
[01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:32.830]  You know, I will say...
[01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:33.410]  That bugged me.
[01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:35.790]  I like sports crazy people.
[01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:37.270]  So, kind of for it.
[01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:37.950]  Wow.
[01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:39.310]  We're talking about the big three.
[01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.970]  This is interesting.
[01:25:40.090 --> 01:25:40.190]  Yeah.
[01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:41.290]  Josh Jackson.
[01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:42.210]  That's not interesting.
[01:25:42.450 --> 01:25:42.530]  No.
[01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:44.010]  Then Brandon Ingram.
[01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:47.830]  And then we'll close it off with Paul Pierce.
[01:25:47.970 --> 01:25:48.230]  Hey!
[01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:49.190]  Wow.
[01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:50.210]  We got all of them, huh?
[01:25:50.250 --> 01:25:50.870]  Of that big three.
[01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:51.450]  That's pretty exciting.
[01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:53.630]  The second we talked about it, the universe delivered.
[01:25:53.970 --> 01:25:54.070]  Yep.
[01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:54.730]  That is...
[01:25:54.730 --> 01:25:57.650]  That's what happens here at The Break Show.
[01:25:57.770 --> 01:25:57.990]  Yep.
[01:25:58.330 --> 01:25:59.510]  Which is the name of this show.
[01:25:59.930 --> 01:26:00.410]  And not...
[01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:02.310]  Face break shit.
[01:26:02.430 --> 01:26:02.990]  That's different.
[01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:04.010]  Well, it's not different.
[01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:04.750]  It's just what it was.
[01:26:04.810 --> 01:26:05.370]  It's just what it was.
[01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:05.910]  Now it's done.
[01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.610]  This is what it is.
[01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:07.310]  Rebranded it.
[01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:07.650]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:08.410 --> 01:26:08.630]  Woo!
[01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:11.410]  Gotta figure out how to make a new logo for that in time for this to go out.
[01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:12.230]  Which probably won't happen.
[01:26:12.370 --> 01:26:12.970]  But, we'll see.
[01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:14.590]  Hey, thanks for inviting me to this one.
[01:26:14.690 --> 01:26:15.390]  I really appreciate it.
[01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:15.690]  Thanks for showing up.
[01:26:15.690 --> 01:26:16.870]  You said you'd give me the calendar invite.
[01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:17.630]  So, I knew like...
[01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:18.430]  Oh, I should...
[01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:19.230]  Don't schedule anything.
[01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:20.630]  I was on Off Topic yesterday because we had to pre-record it.
[01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:20.930]  Uh-huh.
[01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:22.130]  I mentioned that we were doing this.
[01:26:22.170 --> 01:26:22.890]  And he's like, when's that?
[01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:24.690]  And then I said, oh, you should come.
[01:26:24.690 --> 01:26:25.310]  And he's like, I will.
[01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:26.390]  And then he's like, great.
[01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:27.230]  So, it's next Wednesday?
[01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:28.530]  And I said, nope.
[01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:29.630]  Well, because you said it was Wednesday.
[01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:31.790]  And I was assuming because I thought Off Topic is Thursdays.
[01:26:32.290 --> 01:26:33.170]  So, you said Wednesday.
[01:26:34.350 --> 01:26:36.030]  And he said, oh, it's like in two weeks.
[01:26:36.150 --> 01:26:37.810]  But, to be fair, he could have said tomorrow.
[01:26:38.010 --> 01:26:39.370]  And I've been like, oh, okay, tomorrow.
[01:26:39.710 --> 01:26:42.610]  Instead, like, if it's Monday and I say, oh, we're doing a thing on Tuesday.
[01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:44.510]  You'd be like, next week?
[01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:45.990]  And it's like, no, no, it's tomorrow.
[01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:47.690]  Yeah, no shit!
[01:26:49.950 --> 01:26:50.790]  Well, there you go.
[01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:54.330]  Thanks for tuning in to this surprise episode of The Break Show.
[01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:56.070]  We hope we entertained you.
[01:26:56.150 --> 01:26:57.030]  We hope you enjoyed it.
[01:26:57.450 --> 01:27:00.110]  And if you want to buy any of these cards, hit up Jack.
[01:27:00.130 --> 01:27:01.790]  Baseballs go on sale Friday!
[01:27:02.110 --> 01:27:02.770]  Friday, baseballs.
[01:27:02.770 --> 01:27:04.070]  Friday, 12 p.m. Central.
[01:27:04.650 --> 01:27:05.030]  That's noon.
[01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.710]  Go get one, bye!
[01:27:05.850 --> 01:27:06.590]  We just say noon.
[01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:07.130]  It's easier to understand.
[01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:08.930]  I hit the shit out of these ones.
[01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:10.150]  Two, one, Bane.
