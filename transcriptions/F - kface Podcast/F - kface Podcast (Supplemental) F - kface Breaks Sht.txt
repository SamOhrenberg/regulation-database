[00:13.210 --> 00:15.090]  Yeah! That's okay.
[00:15.290 --> 00:15.610]  Let's do that.
[00:17.770 --> 00:18.810]  It's a blast!
[00:19.930 --> 00:20.450]  No!
[00:21.150 --> 00:21.670]  No!
[00:22.670 --> 00:24.670]  Well, first off, turn that other one off.
[00:25.250 --> 00:26.210]  Oh, boy!
[00:26.470 --> 00:27.850]  Uh-huh.
[00:28.630 --> 00:30.510]  See, this is why we need Emily.
[00:31.170 --> 00:31.810]  Oh, boy.
[00:32.310 --> 00:34.250]  She's way better at this than both of us together.
[00:34.470 --> 00:34.830]  Oh, no.
[00:36.790 --> 00:39.510]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of...
[00:40.850 --> 00:41.310]  FaceBreakShit.
[00:41.690 --> 00:43.470]  This one, typically, we do in 90 minutes.
[00:43.590 --> 00:45.210]  You guys have seen these. We've been doing them for a while.
[00:45.390 --> 00:46.570]  This one is a mini one.
[00:47.090 --> 00:48.690]  It's just Eric and I, absent.
[00:48.790 --> 00:51.010]  We are Gavin, Andrew,
[00:51.570 --> 00:53.590]  Emily, and then, as always,
[00:53.710 --> 00:55.330]  absent, regular
[00:55.330 --> 00:56.450]  Fan Jack.
[00:56.830 --> 00:58.210]  Could you believe that he's like,
[00:58.330 --> 00:59.170]  You never invited me.
[00:59.410 --> 01:00.470]  Never invited me.
[01:01.770 --> 01:04.650]  Can you believe that? That was ridiculous.
[01:05.570 --> 01:07.830]  I don't know...
[01:07.830 --> 01:10.230]  Am I supposed to hold his hand
[01:10.230 --> 01:11.410]  and give him a gentle kiss?
[01:11.830 --> 01:14.150]  I don't understand what's obstinance
[01:14.150 --> 01:15.710]  and what's...
[01:15.710 --> 01:17.770]  Is he dim?
[01:18.390 --> 01:19.430]  Do you mind if I clockwork orange?
[01:19.730 --> 01:20.450]  Is that guy dim?
[01:21.550 --> 01:22.030]  Yeah.
[01:23.030 --> 01:25.370]  It's just like not having a good faith argument.
[01:26.290 --> 01:28.030]  He's just there to be like,
[01:28.550 --> 01:29.990]  Nuh-uh, you didn't do it right.
[01:30.170 --> 01:31.830]  My name is Contrary.
[01:33.650 --> 01:35.290]  Alright, so,
[01:36.430 --> 01:37.650]  if you're new to this,
[01:37.750 --> 01:38.890]  what we do is we open up
[01:38.890 --> 01:39.930]  baseball cards,
[01:40.770 --> 01:42.470]  just weird shit, barbie cards,
[01:43.850 --> 01:44.530]  grease cards,
[01:44.630 --> 01:46.530]  so we can try to chase my first boner.
[01:47.350 --> 01:49.050]  We always look for Don Zimmer,
[01:49.590 --> 01:49.930]  obviously.
[01:51.790 --> 01:52.990]  And we have a little bit of fun.
[01:53.070 --> 01:54.590]  Today we're going to do a little bit of house cleaning.
[01:54.710 --> 01:56.050]  I got some stuff to open up, some mail.
[01:56.810 --> 01:58.470]  I want to do a little bit of show and tell.
[01:58.610 --> 01:59.090]  I like it.
[01:59.090 --> 02:00.890]  And then open up
[02:00.890 --> 02:02.270]  a couple of chase cards.
[02:02.730 --> 02:04.650]  But, as with all things,
[02:06.030 --> 02:06.750]  fuck face exists...
[02:06.750 --> 02:08.070]  fuck face exists
[02:09.970 --> 02:10.450]  for
[02:10.950 --> 02:13.050]  the love and reverie of one
[02:13.050 --> 02:13.490]  Don Zimmer.
[02:13.730 --> 02:16.110]  And so to that end, I bought four packs
[02:17.010 --> 02:19.230]  of 1981 Major League Baseball.
[02:19.230 --> 02:20.410]  Went to the baseball card shop
[02:21.930 --> 02:23.350]  yesterday and bought these.
[02:23.470 --> 02:24.810]  We had a conversation about
[02:24.810 --> 02:27.230]  everything here facing that way, so that way it's all
[02:27.230 --> 02:27.970]  the right side up.
[02:29.270 --> 02:29.630]  Oh, cool!
[02:31.950 --> 02:33.630]  These were only $1 each?
[02:33.790 --> 02:34.690]  Yeah, these were $1 each.
[02:34.830 --> 02:37.090]  That's what $19.99 is worth.
[02:37.710 --> 02:38.850]  Historically. Not a buck.
[02:38.950 --> 02:39.370]  That's cool.
[02:40.070 --> 02:42.870]  So you said $19.99 and you said $19.81.
[02:43.110 --> 02:44.650]  And these say $19.91 on them.
[02:44.770 --> 02:47.230]  I'm pretty sure I've just been saying $19.91 this entire time.
[02:47.330 --> 02:48.810]  Is that what you're pretty sure of?
[02:48.830 --> 02:50.130]  I'm pretty sure, unless I'm having a stroke.
[02:50.430 --> 02:51.990]  You might be having a stroke.
[02:52.950 --> 02:55.590]  $19.91 is the year we're going for.
[02:55.590 --> 02:56.810]  Don Zimmer manager card.
[02:57.410 --> 02:58.710]  Typically we have a full setup.
[02:58.970 --> 03:00.870]  You can see we've got Zim right there.
[03:00.950 --> 03:01.750]  We've got the Zim Bears.
[03:02.570 --> 03:04.850]  We've got the baseball bat that I hit.
[03:05.070 --> 03:06.450]  I crushed all those home runs with.
[03:07.230 --> 03:08.990]  Some socks. Of course, two left socks.
[03:09.350 --> 03:12.190]  But not the full display, because this is a bit of a mini-show.
[03:12.310 --> 03:12.990]  And I don't want to set it up.
[03:13.270 --> 03:15.190]  So, to that end,
[03:15.290 --> 03:17.550]  I'd still want to support Zimmer.
[03:17.890 --> 03:19.490]  So I brought some
[03:19.490 --> 03:21.670]  home Zimmer cards that we can...
[03:21.670 --> 03:22.150]  Wow, really?
[03:22.150 --> 03:24.930]  Yeah, to hopefully juice the magic a little bit.
[03:24.970 --> 03:26.130]  How do you think this works?
[03:26.590 --> 03:27.450]  Just out of curiosity.
[03:27.690 --> 03:30.130]  Hang on, are you putting these as decoration
[03:30.130 --> 03:31.010]  just for us?
[03:31.470 --> 03:33.450]  Yeah, just so that we...
[03:33.450 --> 03:36.070]  I mean, if there's a wide or something,
[03:36.190 --> 03:36.770]  they can be shown.
[03:37.230 --> 03:40.710]  I just want to hear.
[03:40.850 --> 03:41.550]  I'll come through here
[03:41.550 --> 03:42.550]  with some different Zimmer.
[03:43.410 --> 03:44.490]  There's some good Zims.
[03:45.490 --> 03:46.970]  So we've surrounded...
[03:46.970 --> 03:48.310]  I kind of like this.
[03:48.310 --> 03:49.610]  So what you've done
[03:49.610 --> 03:50.830]  is surrounded
[03:51.990 --> 03:53.390]  all of these packs
[03:53.390 --> 03:55.110]  with different Zims
[03:55.110 --> 03:58.150]  to hopefully entice a Zim
[03:58.150 --> 03:58.910]  to come out.
[03:59.230 --> 04:01.250]  Oh my god, we have a wide. Can you believe it?
[04:01.270 --> 04:02.910]  Look, here's two PSA-rated right there.
[04:03.450 --> 04:04.370]  Wow, really?
[04:05.550 --> 04:07.750]  You have two PSA-rated Dons.
[04:08.050 --> 04:09.590]  Yeah, baby, they're both sevens.
[04:09.850 --> 04:10.970]  It's hard to get much higher than that.
[04:11.550 --> 04:12.930]  Unless you want to spend money.
[04:15.050 --> 04:16.210]  Let's just get right to it.
[04:16.210 --> 04:17.150]  Let's get tight on the shot.
[04:17.250 --> 04:20.150]  With the power of Zim, let's open these packs
[04:20.150 --> 04:21.110]  and see if we pull a Zim.
[04:22.590 --> 04:23.430]  Okay, here we go.
[04:23.670 --> 04:24.290]  This is exciting.
[04:25.430 --> 04:26.870]  You can be watching this on Twitch.
[04:27.050 --> 04:28.690]  You can be watching this on the Rooster Teeth site.
[04:28.850 --> 04:29.910]  We're on Twitch now. That's exciting.
[04:30.290 --> 04:32.210]  Is this our first time Twitch-ing?
[04:34.030 --> 04:35.310]  Twitch-ing? Nope.
[04:36.130 --> 04:36.890]  Had it right the first time.
[04:37.150 --> 04:39.970]  Harold Baines, when he played for the A's.
[04:40.450 --> 04:41.830]  Oh, this is for you right here.
[04:42.130 --> 04:43.250]  All-time great hitter.
[04:43.250 --> 04:44.210]  Tony Nguyen.
[04:44.210 --> 04:47.410]  The greatest to ever do it.
[04:47.710 --> 04:48.730]  Rick Aguilera.
[04:49.470 --> 04:51.050]  Oh, here we have a 1990
[04:51.830 --> 04:53.410]  Kevin Moss record-breaker.
[04:53.590 --> 04:53.810]  Beautiful.
[04:54.190 --> 04:56.290]  And then nobody remembered Kevin Moss ever again.
[04:57.130 --> 04:58.290]  This is Jim Eisenreich.
[04:58.610 --> 05:00.170]  Here is Jim...
[05:01.190 --> 05:02.490]  Oh, here's Jose Mesa.
[05:03.770 --> 05:04.850]  You like the Orioles.
[05:05.690 --> 05:06.950]  Rick Parker. He's a giant.
[05:07.030 --> 05:08.290]  You love the Giants. Oh, here we go.
[05:08.330 --> 05:08.890]  Bip Roberts.
[05:08.890 --> 05:10.630]  Hey! Big Bip.
[05:11.050 --> 05:11.650]  J. Bell.
[05:12.610 --> 05:13.710]  It's hard to read these upside down.
[05:14.030 --> 05:14.970]  Pete Harnish.
[05:16.370 --> 05:17.210]  Edgar Diaz.
[05:19.270 --> 05:20.110]  Tom Gordon.
[05:20.370 --> 05:21.050]  You're doing great.
[05:21.930 --> 05:22.770]  Willie Blair.
[05:23.830 --> 05:25.370]  And then Greg Swindell.
[05:26.530 --> 05:27.630]  So far, no Zim.
[05:28.470 --> 05:29.650]  We have three more chances.
[05:29.790 --> 05:30.850]  We have plenty of Zims left.
[05:33.570 --> 05:35.290]  This is good. I feel good about this, though.
[05:35.430 --> 05:36.650]  Well, it's because I brought the Zims out.
[05:36.650 --> 05:38.630]  Yeah, which I do appreciate.
[05:38.830 --> 05:40.650]  You've really set the stage.
[05:41.610 --> 05:42.550]  Yeah, you've made this happen.
[05:43.430 --> 05:43.990]  Alright, here we go.
[05:44.130 --> 05:45.770]  Oh, Danny Tartable. I love Danny Tartable.
[05:45.990 --> 05:47.370]  That's a great name, too.
[05:47.530 --> 05:48.810]  It's a great baseball name.
[05:50.050 --> 05:50.850]  Milt Thompson.
[05:53.410 --> 05:54.710]  Whoa! That's a good one.
[05:54.950 --> 05:55.750]  We'll just put that over there.
[05:55.970 --> 05:57.370]  He's doing like a Matrix move.
[05:57.590 --> 06:00.170]  Oh, there we go. That's a Matrix shot.
[06:00.250 --> 06:00.950]  Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[06:01.570 --> 06:05.110]  Tim Belcher. We'll make that a new Chase Matrix shot.
[06:05.670 --> 06:06.590]  Oh, here we go.
[06:06.670 --> 06:08.190]  All-time great giant, Gary Carter.
[06:10.070 --> 06:11.110]  Damon Berryhill.
[06:11.810 --> 06:13.550]  Ooh, back when the Royals had a cool logo.
[06:13.690 --> 06:14.850]  Kurt Stilwell.
[06:16.230 --> 06:17.270]  Hubie Brooks.
[06:17.990 --> 06:18.750]  For the Dodgers.
[06:19.130 --> 06:20.330]  Ooh, Don Paul.
[06:21.950 --> 06:24.590]  Oh, Carlton Fisk.
[06:25.350 --> 06:26.750]  Ooh, here's Mark Davis.
[06:27.190 --> 06:28.930]  You're excited about all these cards.
[06:29.050 --> 06:29.630]  None of them are Zims.
[06:30.150 --> 06:31.090]  Dave Clark.
[06:31.090 --> 06:33.050]  Ken Patterson.
[06:33.670 --> 06:35.130]  The John Russell.
[06:35.670 --> 06:37.470]  Looking like he's smuggling a sausage in his pants.
[06:38.070 --> 06:39.110]  Bill Kruger.
[06:39.910 --> 06:41.330]  And then Geoff Robinson.
[06:42.090 --> 06:43.170]  Okay, no Zims.
[06:44.310 --> 06:44.910]  Nothing...
[06:44.910 --> 06:46.030]  We got a Matrix shot.
[06:46.810 --> 06:50.030]  I'm a big fan of that Matrix shot.
[06:50.130 --> 06:51.050]  That's awesome.
[06:52.130 --> 06:54.230]  He's really getting out of the way of Agent Smith.
[06:55.150 --> 06:56.090]  Ricky Henderson.
[06:56.810 --> 06:58.010]  Everybody loves Ricky Henderson.
[06:58.010 --> 06:58.970]  Including Ricky Henderson.
[06:59.450 --> 07:00.770]  Maybe mostly Ricky Henderson.
[07:02.130 --> 07:03.790]  Daryl Akerfeld.
[07:04.090 --> 07:05.390]  Dwight Smith climbing the wall.
[07:06.010 --> 07:08.110]  Rick Ruchel.
[07:09.910 --> 07:11.230]  Mike Lavella.
[07:11.810 --> 07:13.030]  Dave Parker.
[07:15.570 --> 07:17.250]  Gary Pettis.
[07:17.950 --> 07:19.390]  Bruce Ruffin.
[07:19.850 --> 07:21.550]  Scott Champerino.
[07:21.910 --> 07:23.030]  That's a good baseball name.
[07:24.930 --> 07:26.170]  Gary Templeton.
[07:26.170 --> 07:26.470]  Hey!
[07:27.610 --> 07:28.610]  Look at Templeton.
[07:29.230 --> 07:31.470]  Not only do we not have a Zimmer, we don't have anything.
[07:31.810 --> 07:33.630]  Nothing real strong here.
[07:33.670 --> 07:35.490]  No managers. Brad Ornsberg.
[07:36.010 --> 07:36.450]  Here we go.
[07:37.490 --> 07:38.510]  Cal Rookin Jr.
[07:39.370 --> 07:41.150]  What's the record that he broke?
[07:41.250 --> 07:43.250]  He probably got played forever and nobody cared.
[07:44.430 --> 07:45.310]  Cal Rookin Jr.
[07:45.390 --> 07:47.230]  On July 28, 1990
[07:47.230 --> 07:49.830]  has his flawless streak of 95
[07:49.830 --> 07:51.750]  consecutive games at shortstop.
[07:52.050 --> 07:53.970]  The former mark of 88 games
[07:53.970 --> 07:55.190]  was set by...
[07:56.750 --> 07:58.050]  Bob McClure.
[07:58.330 --> 07:59.190]  And then Kurt Wilkerson.
[07:59.290 --> 07:59.850]  Last pack.
[08:00.550 --> 08:01.990]  No Zims.
[08:02.390 --> 08:03.030]  No managers.
[08:03.370 --> 08:06.590]  Which is equally troubling.
[08:09.710 --> 08:11.350]  Baseball is a top-down sport.
[08:11.710 --> 08:13.270]  You need to be celebrating the managers.
[08:13.730 --> 08:15.850]  So they can inspire the...
[08:15.850 --> 08:17.830]  They're like the producers
[08:17.830 --> 08:18.810]  of baseball.
[08:19.910 --> 08:21.190]  David Wells.
[08:21.190 --> 08:21.850]  Oh!
[08:22.790 --> 08:23.610]  All right, Boomer.
[08:24.890 --> 08:26.090]  Paul Molitor.
[08:26.950 --> 08:28.110]  He was always very good, but boring.
[08:28.610 --> 08:29.630]  John Shelby.
[08:30.590 --> 08:31.710]  Ramon Martinez.
[08:33.410 --> 08:34.610]  Bob Walk.
[08:35.090 --> 08:36.250]  Kevin Elster.
[08:36.350 --> 08:36.630]  Here we go.
[08:38.910 --> 08:40.110]  Art Howe.
[08:40.590 --> 08:41.610]  Geoff Kunkel.
[08:42.330 --> 08:43.610]  That's a good baseball name.
[08:45.270 --> 08:46.470]  Geoff Kunkel.
[08:47.110 --> 08:48.310]  It's all in how you say it.
[08:48.310 --> 08:49.470]  Wes Chamberlain.
[08:49.810 --> 08:51.250]  John Blaski.
[08:51.910 --> 08:53.110]  Wally Whitehurst.
[08:53.610 --> 08:54.970]  Chris Nabholz.
[08:55.990 --> 08:57.150]  What's his name?
[08:57.530 --> 08:58.070]  Nabholz.
[09:02.210 --> 09:03.570]  Geoff Weirden.
[09:04.030 --> 09:04.790]  Tim Costco.
[09:05.510 --> 09:07.530]  No, it's Costa.
[09:07.750 --> 09:08.570]  Oh, man.
[09:09.210 --> 09:13.010]  I wanted it to be Tim Costco so bad.
[09:13.250 --> 09:14.570]  If my name was Tim Costco,
[09:14.690 --> 09:16.450]  I would change my name to Tim Costo.
[09:16.450 --> 09:18.310]  It just feels like
[09:18.310 --> 09:19.410]  we could have
[09:20.350 --> 09:21.690]  started a pile of
[09:22.990 --> 09:23.910]  store guys.
[09:24.230 --> 09:25.390]  We can put it in there.
[09:26.850 --> 09:27.810]  It's not Costco.
[09:28.970 --> 09:29.530]  It's tough.
[09:31.050 --> 09:32.470]  Let's do something a little
[09:32.470 --> 09:34.490]  more current. I'll tell you what.
[09:35.210 --> 09:36.490]  We'll do this pack of
[09:36.490 --> 09:38.370]  Mosaic, and I'll do a little show-and-tell with you, Eric.
[09:38.390 --> 09:38.950]  I'm excited.
[09:39.190 --> 09:42.510]  I opened one pack at home yesterday.
[09:42.590 --> 09:44.110]  Is that a treat for you?
[09:44.110 --> 09:44.890]  Is that why you do that?
[09:45.130 --> 09:47.930]  I bought the stuff for work, which I'm going to open.
[09:48.150 --> 09:49.870]  Because I don't want to sit and look at
[09:49.870 --> 09:51.830]  baseball cards for 24 hours
[09:51.830 --> 09:53.450]  in my house unopened,
[09:53.590 --> 09:56.310]  I buy a couple just to...
[09:56.310 --> 09:56.910]  It's a treat.
[09:57.410 --> 09:58.590]  You can have one as a treat.
[09:58.690 --> 10:00.950]  It's like opening a present on Christmas Eve.
[10:01.970 --> 10:03.370]  But you bought it.
[10:03.470 --> 10:05.650]  I bought it for myself. Here's the present I got.
[10:05.970 --> 10:07.210]  I'll show you what's interesting about this.
[10:07.470 --> 10:09.610]  This is a Devin Vassell Fast Break rookie card.
[10:09.610 --> 10:10.870]  Is that auto on card?
[10:11.610 --> 10:12.730]  No, it's a sticker.
[10:12.930 --> 10:15.270]  Not a numbered card or anything, but it is a rookie auto.
[10:15.530 --> 10:16.510]  And it is a parallel.
[10:16.830 --> 10:17.530]  And it's really nice.
[10:18.230 --> 10:20.610]  Saw something about this card I've never seen
[10:20.610 --> 10:23.170]  in the, I don't know, 35 years
[10:23.170 --> 10:24.130]  I've bought baseball cards.
[10:25.870 --> 10:27.170]  Came with a
[10:27.170 --> 10:28.790]  sticky note on the back of it that says
[10:28.790 --> 10:30.370]  number 8. I left it on.
[10:30.630 --> 10:32.990]  I guess maybe
[10:32.990 --> 10:34.950]  they're like signed in
[10:34.950 --> 10:36.650]  piles and they put the sticky notes on them.
[10:36.730 --> 10:38.330]  And somehow it made it through
[10:38.330 --> 10:40.270]  it made it through all the cue
[10:40.270 --> 10:42.310]  quality assurance, it got put back into the rotation
[10:42.710 --> 10:44.450]  then it got inserted into the pack
[10:44.450 --> 10:46.070]  with this post-it note on it.
[10:46.070 --> 10:48.370]  That's really cool. Yeah, so I'm going to leave it on forever.
[10:48.390 --> 10:50.110]  Oh yeah, absolutely. That's a good one.
[10:50.250 --> 10:51.950]  Yeah, I wonder who wrote number 8.
[10:52.010 --> 10:54.670]  I don't know, because honestly, they did it really poorly.
[10:54.850 --> 10:55.890]  Yeah, it's not the best number 8.
[10:56.230 --> 10:58.270]  I mean, the number 8 is just kind of like two
[10:58.270 --> 11:00.330]  circles, and it seems like they just went way
[11:00.330 --> 11:01.310]  too far with them. Yeah.
[11:01.930 --> 11:03.570]  They were definitely over-enthusiastic.
[11:03.810 --> 11:05.950]  It was more attention than an 8 needed.
[11:05.950 --> 11:07.650]  Anyway, it's a good card.
[11:07.810 --> 11:08.410]  It's pretty cool. Yeah.
[11:09.170 --> 11:11.930]  But way cooler, I bet you've never pulled a card
[11:11.930 --> 11:12.750]  with a post-it note. No.
[11:13.170 --> 11:14.270]  Out of the pack. Never.
[11:15.950 --> 11:18.090]  So you bought one of these
[11:18.090 --> 11:19.530]  mosaics. How many cards are in this pack?
[11:20.230 --> 11:22.030]  There's going to be 8 cards
[11:22.030 --> 11:24.370]  in this pack. I paid $26.95.
[11:24.830 --> 11:25.890]  Got my money's worth
[11:25.890 --> 11:27.330]  in post-it notes alone.
[11:27.790 --> 11:29.450]  We talked about this before,
[11:30.390 --> 11:31.390]  me and the crew.
[11:31.790 --> 11:33.890]  It feels like the more money you
[11:33.890 --> 11:35.910]  pay for a pack, the less cards
[11:35.910 --> 11:37.990]  there are in the pack, and then
[11:37.990 --> 11:40.270]  it's just like, oh, this was $450.
[11:40.790 --> 11:42.130]  It's 11 cards.
[11:42.450 --> 11:44.030]  Collecting cards is a financial
[11:44.030 --> 11:44.770]  race to the bottom.
[11:46.810 --> 11:47.830]  Larry Nance Jr.
[11:48.310 --> 11:49.490]  Awesome. Okay.
[11:49.870 --> 11:51.990]  I wish... I hope he figures
[11:51.990 --> 11:53.710]  it out. Zion Williamson.
[11:53.790 --> 11:55.790]  I think...
[11:55.790 --> 11:58.030]  A lot of funny stuff
[11:58.030 --> 11:59.090]  been said about Zion this year.
[11:59.330 --> 12:01.910]  Sports media has really had a ball.
[12:01.910 --> 12:03.830]  No pun intended.
[12:04.330 --> 12:05.430]  Just hope he gets healthy.
[12:05.930 --> 12:08.050]  Big fan of Zion. Can't wait to see him.
[12:08.210 --> 12:09.390]  Hopefully next year. Al Horford!
[12:10.070 --> 12:12.170]  Hey! Celtics
[12:12.170 --> 12:13.670]  MVP Al Horford.
[12:13.830 --> 12:15.390]  Oh my god!
[12:15.670 --> 12:17.910]  Doing it for all us 35-year-olds.
[12:18.190 --> 12:19.390]  Thank you, Big Al.
[12:19.670 --> 12:21.230]  Showing up, showing out.
[12:21.670 --> 12:23.690]  Tearing it up for whatever fucking reason.
[12:23.730 --> 12:25.870]  No one else can do it. Because Giannis
[12:25.870 --> 12:26.670]  looked at him wrong.
[12:28.190 --> 12:30.010]  Giannis Antetokounmpo looked at him wrong
[12:30.010 --> 12:31.990]  and Al said, okay, I'm going to dunk
[12:31.990 --> 12:34.050]  on you, I'm going to hit you in the face, I'm going to destroy
[12:34.050 --> 12:35.530]  you. 35!
[12:36.110 --> 12:38.310]  Al Horford's children are probably
[12:38.310 --> 12:39.290]  driving age.
[12:40.070 --> 12:40.470]  And...
[12:42.470 --> 12:42.870]  And...
[12:43.470 --> 12:45.870]  He just had a game where he went off.
[12:47.270 --> 12:47.810]  That's true.
[12:47.910 --> 12:49.890]  He saved our season. Absolutely.
[12:49.970 --> 12:52.010]  At least for one more night. Eric Pascal.
[12:52.670 --> 12:53.930]  He is no longer with
[12:53.930 --> 12:56.450]  Golden State. Jason Tatum.
[12:56.530 --> 12:56.930]  Hey!
[12:56.930 --> 12:59.150]  We call him in my house.
[12:59.270 --> 13:01.090]  Great, good. Oh, cool!
[13:01.390 --> 13:02.550]  Look at that. National Pride
[13:02.550 --> 13:04.850]  LaMelo Ball year two card. That's nice.
[13:05.710 --> 13:06.490]  Kawhi Leonard.
[13:06.770 --> 13:08.810]  He was the most dominant player
[13:08.810 --> 13:10.070]  in baseball. They called him the Claw.
[13:11.790 --> 13:13.430]  Feels like it's been about six years
[13:13.430 --> 13:15.070]  since he went to the Flippers.
[13:15.330 --> 13:16.530]  Apple man eats apples, man.
[13:16.690 --> 13:17.490]  Apple man eats apples.
[13:18.010 --> 13:19.170]  I can't get enough of that.
[13:21.050 --> 13:22.650]  Do you ever just watch
[13:22.650 --> 13:24.350]  compilations of Kawhi Leonard laughing?
[13:24.350 --> 13:25.490]  It's awesome.
[13:26.250 --> 13:27.670]  He's not human.
[13:27.930 --> 13:29.470]  People just tell him a joke and he goes
[13:30.610 --> 13:32.190]  It's perfect. He's bizarre, man.
[13:32.590 --> 13:33.930]  Phenomenal basketball player.
[13:34.030 --> 13:35.250]  If he were ever to be healthy again.
[13:35.790 --> 13:38.110]  SGA montage card. Shai Gildas-Alexander.
[13:38.210 --> 13:39.950]  He's a very good player over there
[13:39.950 --> 13:42.310]  in the Presti-led Oklahoma City Thunder.
[13:42.430 --> 13:43.690]  Doing great things over there.
[13:44.630 --> 13:45.210]  You know,
[13:45.950 --> 13:47.290]  a lot of fun to talk about.
[13:47.450 --> 13:50.410]  Not $26 worth of cards, per se.
[13:50.590 --> 13:51.710]  Can I show something real quick?
[13:51.710 --> 13:53.530]  I got some cards sent to me by
[13:54.670 --> 13:55.870]  Joel, a friend
[13:55.870 --> 13:56.670]  of the show.
[13:57.190 --> 13:59.210]  He's a Padres.
[13:59.630 --> 14:01.910]  Well, he collects a lot of cards. I said, I'm a Padres fan.
[14:01.970 --> 14:02.990]  He said, I'll send you some stuff.
[14:03.090 --> 14:05.010]  There's a tweet where that happened.
[14:05.450 --> 14:07.770]  There's me replying. Which we found out is Eric's favorite
[14:07.770 --> 14:09.650]  thing in the world. To receive a letter
[14:09.650 --> 14:11.470]  in the mail that's just a printed out tweet.
[14:11.610 --> 14:13.550]  It's really exciting. So I got some cards.
[14:13.790 --> 14:15.650]  They're just Padres cards. I just want to open
[14:15.650 --> 14:17.550]  these quickly, see what they are, because I know
[14:17.550 --> 14:19.170]  they're all Padres. So, let's see.
[14:19.170 --> 14:20.450]  Here is...
[14:20.450 --> 14:22.390]  Ooh, I like this. Tony Gwynn.
[14:22.650 --> 14:23.690]  That's a good looking one, man.
[14:24.590 --> 14:27.050]  And then here's a Tony Gwynn.
[14:29.170 --> 14:30.190]  And then here's
[14:30.190 --> 14:31.290]  the worst Padre.
[14:32.810 --> 14:33.750]  He's now a red.
[14:33.910 --> 14:35.110]  You see what's weird about all these?
[14:35.210 --> 14:36.450]  These are all Panini cards.
[14:36.970 --> 14:38.010]  They're all very nice.
[14:38.810 --> 14:41.170]  They don't have the MLB license, so you're not seeing
[14:41.850 --> 14:42.970]  his logo. Oh, you're right!
[14:43.130 --> 14:44.350]  It's just colors and stuff.
[14:45.910 --> 14:46.710]  Manny Machado.
[14:46.710 --> 14:47.950]  Great looking.
[14:48.230 --> 14:50.770]  This is insane. Now that you pointed that out,
[14:51.290 --> 14:52.370]  it's all I can see.
[14:52.850 --> 14:54.650]  Austin Hedges. He's with the Guardians
[14:54.650 --> 14:55.710]  now. No longer a Padre.
[14:56.250 --> 14:58.710]  Mackenzie Gore. He is a prospect
[14:58.710 --> 15:00.690]  that finally turned out. He's a starter for the San Diego
[15:00.690 --> 15:01.610]  Padres. Guys, awesome.
[15:02.370 --> 15:04.850]  Franchise Feats. Tony Gwynn.
[15:04.910 --> 15:06.210]  Looking great. Love that.
[15:07.110 --> 15:08.650]  Here's a Donruss Diamond Kings.
[15:09.650 --> 15:10.870]  Fernando Tatis Jr.
[15:12.010 --> 15:12.490]  Here's
[15:12.490 --> 15:14.470]  Chris Paddock. He plays for,
[15:14.470 --> 15:16.150]  I think, the Twins now.
[15:16.230 --> 15:18.110]  Nice. And then,
[15:18.430 --> 15:19.030]  here is
[15:20.810 --> 15:22.010]  Manuel Margot
[15:22.010 --> 15:23.810]  of, I think,
[15:24.010 --> 15:25.830]  he plays for Tampa Bay.
[15:26.430 --> 15:28.070]  Got another card here that says,
[15:28.550 --> 15:30.570]  this guy isn't a Padre, but he did
[15:30.570 --> 15:32.490]  get caught jerking it in a parking
[15:32.490 --> 15:34.230]  lot in his car, and I figured
[15:34.230 --> 15:36.110]  you'd want a piece of that history.
[15:36.710 --> 15:38.770]  It's Reese McGuire.
[15:44.940 --> 15:45.460]  That's...
[15:45.460 --> 15:47.620]  And it's autographed.
[15:47.820 --> 15:49.200]  Oh, I don't want to touch it!
[15:49.620 --> 15:51.240]  That's the
[15:51.240 --> 15:53.240]  same hand that touched his dick in a
[15:53.240 --> 15:55.100]  parking lot. That's awesome. This one
[15:55.100 --> 15:57.140]  simply said open last, so we're going to see what it is.
[15:58.520 --> 15:59.160]  That's like
[15:59.160 --> 16:01.280]  legend. That's Hall of Fame right there.
[16:01.940 --> 16:03.020]  This is a
[16:03.020 --> 16:04.620]  Fernando Tatis Jr. card
[16:06.040 --> 16:06.560]  that...
[16:07.340 --> 16:09.200]  That's a Tatis Jr. rookie
[16:09.200 --> 16:10.660]  card, dude. Yes, it is.
[16:11.660 --> 16:12.460]  No way!
[16:13.640 --> 16:14.720]  Hey, you thought there
[16:14.720 --> 16:15.240]  was no hope.
[16:16.540 --> 16:18.580]  Oh, shit, we did get a Zimmer! We got
[16:18.580 --> 16:20.640]  a Zimmer! Oh, man, who
[16:20.640 --> 16:22.480]  sent that to us? This is Joel. Joel,
[16:22.580 --> 16:24.780]  you're fucking awesome, Joel. Thank you.
[16:24.920 --> 16:25.180]  At
[16:26.960 --> 16:28.660]  joelar underscore bear one.
[16:28.780 --> 16:30.640]  Thank you, Joel. Dude, I'm going to
[16:30.640 --> 16:32.620]  look your Tatis rookie up. Dude, wow!
[16:32.780 --> 16:34.760]  These are awesome. We got a Zim also?
[16:35.060 --> 16:35.920]  Holy cow!
[16:36.560 --> 16:38.360]  What is this? 410?
[16:39.100 --> 16:39.980]  Man, wow!
[16:40.120 --> 16:42.180]  We're going to have a look at that. That's a great looking
[16:42.180 --> 16:44.220]  Tatis card. I didn't want to say that it was a rookie
[16:44.220 --> 16:45.780]  because I wasn't sure, but I thought it was.
[16:47.020 --> 16:48.160]  It's not crazy,
[16:48.380 --> 16:50.160]  but it's, you know, it's a Tatis
[16:50.160 --> 16:52.260]  rookie. Yeah, no, that's sweet. I think
[16:52.260 --> 16:53.640]  the real get
[16:54.220 --> 16:54.800]  is the
[16:57.360 --> 16:58.440]  story we learned
[16:58.440 --> 17:00.120]  about Reese McGuire jerking off
[17:00.120 --> 17:02.120]  in a parking lot. The auto
[17:03.300 --> 17:04.100]  on card
[17:04.920 --> 17:06.440]  of Reese McGuire.
[17:10.320 --> 17:10.640]  So
[17:10.640 --> 17:12.100]  when we get our permanent set,
[17:12.100 --> 17:14.380]  we're going to have on the wall, we're going to be able to put
[17:14.380 --> 17:16.120]  our favorite. We're going to have our official collection.
[17:16.960 --> 17:18.100]  That one's going on there.
[17:18.360 --> 17:20.460]  Oh boy. Well, thank you, Joel.
[17:20.720 --> 17:21.820]  I appreciate that, man.
[17:22.140 --> 17:22.960]  These were great.
[17:23.980 --> 17:26.400]  We got to add this Zimmer to the pile.
[17:26.780 --> 17:28.240]  Look at that. We got a Zimmer, man.
[17:28.320 --> 17:29.800]  Isn't that cool? That's so great.
[17:30.100 --> 17:32.380]  Man, thank you, Joel. Appreciate you. Yeah, Joel, you're the best.
[17:32.460 --> 17:34.380]  Thank you. Wow. If you want to send us
[17:34.380 --> 17:36.380]  stuff, you can. 1901 East 51st
[17:36.380 --> 17:37.900]  Street, Austin, Texas 78723.
[17:38.120 --> 17:40.020]  Just address it to fuckfacebreakshit.
[17:40.160 --> 17:42.280]  That's fine. Doesn't have to be
[17:42.280 --> 17:43.640]  related to jerking off, but
[17:44.900 --> 17:46.400]  who are we to judge? Not everything has
[17:46.400 --> 17:48.180]  to have a crazy story. Some can be cool cards,
[17:48.300 --> 17:50.160]  stuff that you find. We've had some good stuff
[17:50.160 --> 17:51.880]  that are sent, but I will say
[17:51.880 --> 17:54.060]  that the guy jerking off
[17:54.500 --> 17:56.360]  is the funniest card
[17:56.360 --> 17:57.540]  I've seen on this show.
[18:00.880 --> 18:02.500]  He wasn't jerking off in the photo.
[18:02.660 --> 18:04.580]  No, but he signed the card.
[18:05.680 --> 18:06.740]  I'm going to go ahead and open up
[18:06.740 --> 18:08.520]  while we're doing mail. Yeah, let's do it.
[18:08.620 --> 18:11.020]  I got a letter. This is from Jason M.
[18:11.960 --> 18:12.700]  He said, my wife and I
[18:12.700 --> 18:14.560]  took a trip from San Diego
[18:14.560 --> 18:16.920]  to L.A. this weekend. San Diego, that's where you're from. Hey, that's where I'm from.
[18:17.120 --> 18:18.620]  You're a big... we'll talk about this
[18:18.620 --> 18:20.800]  tomorrow on fuckface, but you're a big water guy in San Diego.
[18:21.520 --> 18:22.600]  He went out to L.A. for the
[18:22.600 --> 18:24.600]  past weekend, and while he was up there, he went to the last book
[18:24.600 --> 18:26.480]  shop, which I've heard a lot about and
[18:26.480 --> 18:28.560]  have yet to go to, and found these
[18:28.560 --> 18:30.700]  cards here. Hope you have some good finds
[18:30.700 --> 18:32.720]  that Eric may remember from his childhood.
[18:32.720 --> 18:34.720]  From my childhood? Kind of related
[18:34.720 --> 18:36.720]  to you. Okay. And so, I thought
[18:36.720 --> 18:37.900]  that was pretty exciting. Okay.
[18:38.720 --> 18:40.800]  Here we got a pack of cards from the
[18:40.800 --> 18:42.420]  San Diego Zoo!
[18:43.420 --> 18:44.960]  World famous San Diego Zoo.
[18:44.980 --> 18:46.860]  It is the best zoo I've ever been to.
[18:47.000 --> 18:48.280]  I will say, when I was a kid
[18:48.280 --> 18:50.800]  in Alabama, the San Diego Zoo was the one
[18:50.800 --> 18:52.880]  you hear about. It is... it's a great
[18:52.880 --> 18:54.180]  zoo. It's a really
[18:54.720 --> 18:56.780]  great zoo. I went not too long ago. How long?
[18:57.240 --> 18:58.640]  Probably like last year. Really?
[18:58.760 --> 19:00.340]  How many times would you say you've been in your life?
[19:00.780 --> 19:02.260]  Oh my god. Dozens?
[19:02.460 --> 19:04.140]  Because we would go for like school field trips every year.
[19:04.500 --> 19:06.460]  That's where we would go. It would just be
[19:06.460 --> 19:08.360]  like the SeaWorld or the Zoo.
[19:08.740 --> 19:09.500]  When you
[19:10.700 --> 19:12.440]  did go to the Zoo, do you remember running
[19:12.440 --> 19:14.480]  into either of those two characters? Yeah, I remember
[19:14.480 --> 19:15.100]  the guy with the mustache.
[19:16.340 --> 19:18.460]  I don't remember the cats. Then there's
[19:18.460 --> 19:19.900]  this guy. Oh, elephant.
[19:20.160 --> 19:21.560]  Got an elephant. Oh!
[19:22.340 --> 19:24.360]  Ew, what? Here's a baby condor.
[19:24.420 --> 19:26.060]  Why did you... look at that!
[19:26.340 --> 19:28.180]  What the fuck? It's a little baby.
[19:28.180 --> 19:30.160]  No! It's a little baby California
[19:30.160 --> 19:31.960]  condor. That's you from California.
[19:32.120 --> 19:34.040]  That's your birthright. Yeah, they were almost
[19:34.040 --> 19:35.820]  gone. There was almost no more of those.
[19:35.940 --> 19:38.200]  Now there's a bunch, so that's nice. It's because people like you didn't
[19:38.200 --> 19:40.040]  think they were cute. Well, look at this fucking... gross.
[19:42.300 --> 19:44.080]  Horticulture fact card. Love it.
[19:44.620 --> 19:45.840]  Oh, shit, dude.
[19:45.980 --> 19:48.120]  Sun bear? This is pretty cool. Eurasian
[19:48.120 --> 19:49.440]  brown bear. That was close.
[19:49.900 --> 19:51.240]  Fucking solid blue background.
[19:52.100 --> 19:53.720]  Don't like this. One bit.
[19:54.220 --> 19:55.020]  Don't care about that.
[19:55.020 --> 19:56.540]  Sort of...
[19:56.540 --> 19:57.720]  fucking another one.
[19:59.060 --> 20:00.900]  Fucking another. And then here's a bird that would
[20:00.900 --> 20:03.080]  eat the snakes. Yeah, here's a marabou
[20:03.080 --> 20:04.900]  stork. See, he would eat snakes
[20:04.900 --> 20:06.800]  probably. That seems right.
[20:07.000 --> 20:07.640]  Looks like Gavin.
[20:09.060 --> 20:09.300]  Oh.
[20:10.980 --> 20:13.000]  Dude, that's awesome. Thank you for the
[20:13.000 --> 20:14.580]  zoo card. That's a great send.
[20:14.940 --> 20:16.640]  That was a lot of fun. I got some more.
[20:16.680 --> 20:19.040]  Let's do it. I have a bunch
[20:19.040 --> 20:21.000]  that's a little bit older than this that I haven't gotten
[20:21.000 --> 20:22.500]  to. I can't believe we got a zimmer.
[20:22.500 --> 20:24.840]  I can't believe we actually got it. That is so cool.
[20:25.260 --> 20:26.340]  It's pretty fucking rad.
[20:26.580 --> 20:29.460]  Oh, this one doesn't have any...
[20:29.460 --> 20:31.020]  There's no note or anything?
[20:31.040 --> 20:32.520]  I think this person talked to me on Twitter, though.
[20:33.040 --> 20:34.320]  And mentioned that they had this. These are crazy.
[20:34.480 --> 20:36.720]  Will you set those down so we can see them? So these are Taco Bell
[20:36.720 --> 20:39.000]  NBA hoops cards. What is this?
[20:39.620 --> 20:40.740]  I've heard of these.
[20:40.860 --> 20:42.320]  So Panini doesn't have...
[20:42.320 --> 20:44.540]  Panini's named after a sandwich. Doesn't have the
[20:44.540 --> 20:46.480]  MLB license, but has the Taco Bell
[20:46.480 --> 20:48.480]  license? In 2012, 2013
[20:48.480 --> 20:50.600]  they did. Now, Eric, do me a favor.
[20:50.960 --> 20:52.840]  Look up who were the top NBA rookies
[20:52.840 --> 20:55.680]  in 2012, because off the top of my head, I cannot...
[20:55.680 --> 20:56.500]  You want me to just look up
[20:56.500 --> 20:58.600]  rookie of the year? Rookie of the year 2012.
[20:59.860 --> 21:00.120]  Okay.
[21:01.700 --> 21:02.580]  You got it.
[21:03.940 --> 21:04.580]  Oh, man.
[21:05.280 --> 21:05.980]  Who's it gonna be?
[21:08.020 --> 21:08.620]  Damien Lillard.
[21:09.860 --> 21:10.760]  Who else was in that track?
[21:10.860 --> 21:12.360]  It's a unanimous selection, bud.
[21:12.840 --> 21:14.620]  Ouch. Wow. So you could get a Damien Lillard
[21:14.620 --> 21:16.700]  rookie in this. We could. Do you think
[21:16.700 --> 21:18.280]  we're going to? Nah. Yeah, I didn't think so.
[21:18.280 --> 21:20.280]  But that's okay. It's opening up a piece of
[21:20.280 --> 21:22.380]  fucking awesome history. Thank you so much to whoever sent
[21:22.380 --> 21:24.160]  this. This is an insane gift.
[21:24.300 --> 21:26.280]  Okay. Here we go. Probably not
[21:26.280 --> 21:27.860]  cheap. Kind of a weird way to open it, but alright.
[21:28.080 --> 21:30.780]  Well, that's how it...
[21:30.780 --> 21:31.840]  Weird packaging.
[21:33.160 --> 21:34.400]  Okay, let's see what we got here.
[21:34.400 --> 21:36.160]  Here we go. Alright, we got...
[21:36.160 --> 21:37.240]  These are weird cards.
[21:38.260 --> 21:40.000]  Manu Ginobili. Easily
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.040]  one of my least favorite players
[21:42.040 --> 21:44.200]  in the history of basketball. What do you mean? This guy's doing it
[21:44.200 --> 21:46.140]  for us 35-year-olds also. Way to go, man.
[21:47.260 --> 21:48.200]  Here's a Landry
[21:48.200 --> 21:50.000]  Fields rookie card. Great.
[21:50.200 --> 21:52.140]  Don't think he's in the league anymore. Paul George.
[21:53.480 --> 21:54.440]  Okay. Oh, look.
[21:55.140 --> 21:56.120]  NBA's newest analyst,
[21:56.240 --> 21:58.060]  J.J. Redick. And then...
[21:59.060 --> 22:00.100]  Chris Bosch. Nice.
[22:00.400 --> 22:02.280]  I saw Chris Bosch running on Town Lake
[22:02.280 --> 22:04.360]  not too long ago. Really? Yeah. That's pretty cool.
[22:04.440 --> 22:06.020]  He was riding my bike. I rode right by him.
[22:06.040 --> 22:07.420]  Did you, like, ride by him and you go,
[22:07.840 --> 22:10.240]  hey, I'm a big fan, and then just ride... No, I wish
[22:10.240 --> 22:11.980]  I had the presence of mind to do that.
[22:12.100 --> 22:14.300]  Those are very cool. Thank you for sending those. Feels like
[22:15.400 --> 22:16.440]  J.J.
[22:16.520 --> 22:18.300]  Redick is not long for the world
[22:18.300 --> 22:20.240]  of ESPN with the
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.480]  salient points that he makes
[22:22.480 --> 22:23.800]  that shut down every argument.
[22:24.300 --> 22:26.260]  Yeah, it really steps in the way of Stephen A.'s
[22:26.260 --> 22:28.200]  bullshit. He's like...
[22:30.920 --> 22:31.960]  Bob Cozy?
[22:32.340 --> 22:34.460]  We fucking played against Bob Cozy?
[22:36.760 --> 22:37.800]  So cool.
[22:38.780 --> 22:40.280]  Okay, we got one more box.
[22:40.500 --> 22:42.260]  Let's see what this is. Let's do it.
[22:44.300 --> 22:45.260]  This is...
[22:46.460 --> 22:48.320]  weird. It's a weird from.
[22:48.560 --> 22:48.860]  Alright.
[22:50.000 --> 22:50.760]  Ah, shit.
[22:51.680 --> 22:52.600]  Falling apart.
[22:53.880 --> 22:55.820]  Whoa, this is sick.
[22:56.040 --> 22:56.840]  I don't know what that is.
[22:58.640 --> 23:00.000]  Fucking old ass gum.
[23:00.240 --> 23:01.380]  Okay, we got...
[23:01.380 --> 23:03.540]  some sort of satanic symbol.
[23:04.520 --> 23:05.600]  Paragon Disc Golf.
[23:05.820 --> 23:08.280]  What did we get?
[23:08.740 --> 23:10.220]  From the Disc Golf store?
[23:10.580 --> 23:12.080]  Thank you for shopping with us.
[23:12.080 --> 23:13.980]  The Disc Golf store?
[23:14.420 --> 23:15.720]  Yeah. I mean, maybe they sell
[23:16.440 --> 23:17.280]  other shit too.
[23:18.400 --> 23:18.760]  2022
[23:20.460 --> 23:20.820]  Golf
[23:22.500 --> 23:24.040]  Disc Golf Training Card!
[23:24.420 --> 23:25.740]  Of course, that's what we got.
[23:25.940 --> 23:27.800]  That makes so much sense.
[23:27.980 --> 23:28.880]  What the fuck?
[23:29.000 --> 23:30.200]  I'm gonna save a pack or two.
[23:31.980 --> 23:33.640]  One or two of those need to go in the pack sack.
[23:33.800 --> 23:36.060]  Dude, we gotta put one of these in the pack sack right now.
[23:36.220 --> 23:38.560]  As you may or may not know...
[23:38.560 --> 23:39.720]  I know it says sack pack.
[23:39.720 --> 23:41.660]  And you might be confused by that.
[23:41.760 --> 23:42.820]  We have a pack sack.
[23:43.760 --> 23:45.320]  You gotta feed the pack sack.
[23:45.720 --> 23:47.000]  And you eat from the pack sack.
[23:47.660 --> 23:48.560]  We just fed it.
[23:50.280 --> 23:52.100]  Fingers crossed we get a Caleb Denecor.
[23:53.760 --> 23:54.940]  We have to, right?
[23:55.000 --> 23:56.120]  What do you think the chances are?
[23:56.840 --> 23:59.300]  You'd have to call him.
[24:00.040 --> 24:01.800]  That would be the second fuckface time
[24:01.800 --> 24:02.480]  we've called him.
[24:04.240 --> 24:05.240]  Putting him in rarefied air.
[24:05.360 --> 24:06.060]  Here's the checklist.
[24:06.780 --> 24:08.220]  Let's see if he's on there.
[24:09.040 --> 24:10.160]  I'm gonna guess he's not.
[24:10.300 --> 24:11.340]  No, I would think he's not.
[24:11.900 --> 24:14.940]  If he was, I would shit your pants.
[24:15.140 --> 24:15.220]  What?
[24:15.520 --> 24:17.080]  Get ready for that.
[24:18.120 --> 24:19.020]  Sorry, I'm still...
[24:20.500 --> 24:22.360]  Here's Kona Star Panis.
[24:22.540 --> 24:23.280]  Peanut Panis.
[24:25.040 --> 24:26.400]  Dean and Carrie.
[24:27.700 --> 24:28.700]  Everybody's favorite
[24:28.700 --> 24:30.120]  Valerie Mendojano.
[24:30.740 --> 24:32.320]  There's a guy named Gannon Burr.
[24:32.520 --> 24:33.820]  That's a really good name.
[24:33.820 --> 24:36.520]  Not to be outdone by Vanessa Van Dyken.
[24:37.500 --> 24:38.740]  James Conrad.
[24:38.920 --> 24:41.560]  Looking like the Norseman.
[24:43.260 --> 24:45.020]  Matt Bell does not.
[24:45.820 --> 24:47.180]  Gavin Rathburn.
[24:47.520 --> 24:48.220]  That's a British name.
[24:48.640 --> 24:50.940]  Ben Calloway.
[24:51.680 --> 24:52.760]  Aaron Gossage.
[24:52.840 --> 24:54.040]  I wonder if he's related to Goose Gossage.
[24:54.860 --> 24:56.140]  Mason Ford.
[24:56.380 --> 24:59.900]  Looking like he works at a Ford dealership.
[24:59.920 --> 25:01.060]  There's a guy named Eagle McMahon.
[25:01.060 --> 25:02.100]  That's a good name.
[25:02.660 --> 25:03.600]  We get that one.
[25:03.720 --> 25:06.600]  That's a great... what is this?
[25:06.720 --> 25:07.680]  Disc Golf name?
[25:08.220 --> 25:10.700]  You know this guy's probably a dick with a name like Brody Smith.
[25:11.040 --> 25:13.240]  And then most improved player
[25:13.240 --> 25:14.760]  is Kyle Klein.
[25:14.940 --> 25:17.240]  Wow, Kyle Klein, you used to fucking suck.
[25:17.360 --> 25:18.940]  But guess what? You figured it out.
[25:19.040 --> 25:21.280]  You figured it out. You were a fucking loser.
[25:21.500 --> 25:22.440]  And now you're not.
[25:22.560 --> 25:24.020]  You threw the frisbee so good.
[25:24.780 --> 25:26.180]  Straight and hard and fast.
[25:26.460 --> 25:27.500]  I can't throw a frisbee.
[25:28.400 --> 25:29.820]  Frisbee's an acquired...
[25:30.580 --> 25:30.900]  ability.
[25:31.100 --> 25:32.980]  I can't throw it straight.
[25:33.540 --> 25:35.700]  Can't do it. Well, I don't see Caleb on here.
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.000]  It's sad. Maybe next year.
[25:37.460 --> 25:39.660]  You know what? Maybe he can get most improved next year.
[25:39.800 --> 25:41.140]  I'm going to save the other one for the PacSec, too.
[25:41.320 --> 25:42.000]  That's awesome.
[25:43.340 --> 25:44.760]  Thank you so much for doing that.
[25:45.520 --> 25:47.040]  How are we doing on time? We got some time left.
[25:47.740 --> 25:48.680]  Let's do a little bit of basketball.
[25:49.660 --> 25:51.680]  It's basketball time. We're in the playoffs.
[25:52.180 --> 25:53.960]  Oh my god. Eric, who's going to win the...
[25:54.880 --> 25:55.760]  Who's going to win the finals?
[25:58.320 --> 25:59.480]  I don't know.
[25:59.720 --> 26:01.100]  Let's just say anybody but Milwaukee.
[26:01.220 --> 26:03.720]  Yeah, I think he'd look good.
[26:04.380 --> 26:05.520]  He'd do look good, don't they?
[26:05.680 --> 26:07.220]  I don't think the Sixers are going to...
[26:07.220 --> 26:08.080]  No, no.
[26:08.940 --> 26:10.940]  They are mentally beaten already.
[26:11.060 --> 26:12.600]  Hey, Geoff, trust the process.
[26:14.180 --> 26:15.040]  You feeding the PacSec?
[26:15.280 --> 26:16.380]  Yeah, I got to feed the PacSec.
[26:16.620 --> 26:17.820]  Putting the pack in right now.
[26:19.720 --> 26:20.420]  PacSec's fed.
[26:20.600 --> 26:23.140]  And then we have these packs of NBA...
[26:23.140 --> 26:25.820]  Donners 2022. That's this year's.
[26:26.200 --> 26:26.520]  Cards.
[26:26.660 --> 26:27.960]  I didn't think that was the noise it was going to make.
[26:30.320 --> 26:31.800]  I thought it was going to be bong.
[26:32.040 --> 26:33.160]  And then it went...
[26:33.160 --> 26:34.660]  It didn't do that.
[26:35.340 --> 26:37.800]  Here we go with Christoph Sporzingas.
[26:38.240 --> 26:40.280]  You know who the Dallas Mavericks
[26:40.280 --> 26:41.140]  could use right about now?
[26:41.980 --> 26:42.620]  Christoph Sporzingas.
[26:42.660 --> 26:43.420]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[26:44.060 --> 26:46.960]  Unfortunately, Spencer Dinwiddie is not showing up in the playoffs.
[26:47.900 --> 26:49.800]  Devin Vassell, we got his rookie card over there
[26:49.800 --> 26:50.820]  with a post-it note on it.
[26:52.560 --> 26:54.300]  You know who the Lakers could use right now?
[26:54.300 --> 26:56.780]  A trade partner for Russell Westbrook.
[26:56.980 --> 26:57.900]  Oh my god.
[26:58.540 --> 27:00.800]  They are not working out there in LA.
[27:01.440 --> 27:02.780]  The Buss family
[27:02.780 --> 27:04.260]  needs to make some moves.
[27:04.580 --> 27:05.580]  Ty Jerome.
[27:06.620 --> 27:07.420]  Here he goes.
[27:08.180 --> 27:10.360]  You know who the Philadelphia 76ers could use right now
[27:10.360 --> 27:12.460]  is Matisse Teibold to get a vaccination
[27:12.980 --> 27:15.060]  and then also get his shot back.
[27:15.260 --> 27:16.240]  The defense is there, but his offense is gone.
[27:16.240 --> 27:18.040]  So he needs two shots.
[27:18.980 --> 27:19.920]  Jarrett Allen.
[27:20.800 --> 27:21.900]  Everybody loves Jarrett Allen.
[27:21.900 --> 27:23.640]  Okay, nothing bad we say about him.
[27:23.840 --> 27:25.280]  Greg Brown, rookie.
[27:25.620 --> 27:28.260]  And then Nurkic, orange parallel.
[27:28.480 --> 27:29.760]  Laser parallel, I believe.
[27:29.920 --> 27:30.460]  That's cute.
[27:31.520 --> 27:32.480]  Where's the laser?
[27:32.760 --> 27:33.020]  Hang on.
[27:33.860 --> 27:36.160]  Do it again.
[27:46.470 --> 27:47.070]  Do you remember earlier
[27:47.070 --> 27:47.630]  when we were
[27:48.630 --> 27:50.390]  opening cards from
[27:51.110 --> 27:52.110]  disc golf players?
[27:54.230 --> 27:55.390]  That was awesome.
[27:55.770 --> 27:56.850]  Remember when we got the card
[27:56.850 --> 27:58.450]  about the guy jerking off? That was awesome.
[27:58.630 --> 28:00.890]  Dude, I need to read up on him.
[28:01.030 --> 28:01.750]  He's my new hero.
[28:02.730 --> 28:04.350]  I don't want to get caught jerking off in public.
[28:04.630 --> 28:06.230]  No, just don't jerk off in public.
[28:07.550 --> 28:09.090]  Yeah, that's the solution to that.
[28:09.650 --> 28:10.930]  I was trying to figure out how not to get
[28:10.930 --> 28:12.410]  caught, but I just don't do it.
[28:13.590 --> 28:14.970]  I gotta figure out how to do
[28:14.970 --> 28:15.810]  this more secret.
[28:16.850 --> 28:18.830]  If only there was a place where no one could
[28:18.830 --> 28:21.010]  catch me. And it's not the parking
[28:21.010 --> 28:22.530]  lot. Brandon Ingram.
[28:23.010 --> 28:24.710]  I'm a professional athlete.
[28:24.710 --> 28:26.310]  I have millions of dollars.
[28:27.070 --> 28:28.870]  Where can I go to jerk
[28:28.870 --> 28:30.730]  off? So he's just cranking it and he hears
[28:33.390 --> 28:34.190]  Toronto PD.
[28:35.150 --> 28:36.370]  P.J. Tucker.
[28:39.270 --> 28:40.070]  Desmond Bain.
[28:40.810 --> 28:42.970]  Very good so far. I feel bad for the Grizzlies.
[28:43.330 --> 28:44.570]  I don't know if you saw, they've announced that
[28:44.570 --> 28:45.970]  Ja's out for the Red Devils playoffs.
[28:46.550 --> 28:48.590]  Bone bruise. You gotta hate that. That's what happened to my butt.
[28:49.510 --> 28:50.710]  I couldn't ride my bike.
[28:51.290 --> 28:52.530]  Here's the deal. If
[28:52.530 --> 28:54.230]  Ja Morant's bone bruise on his shin
[28:54.230 --> 28:56.450]  is anything like the bone bruise on my butt,
[28:56.750 --> 28:57.970]  he's down for three months.
[28:58.010 --> 29:00.510]  Think about how hurting your tailbone hurts.
[29:00.690 --> 29:02.390]  Think about if you bang your shin on the
[29:02.390 --> 29:04.310]  side of a table. Now imagine it's a bone bruise.
[29:04.750 --> 29:06.190]  Thinking about it gives me chills.
[29:06.410 --> 29:08.410]  It hurts me without even knowing what it
[29:08.410 --> 29:09.730]  really feels like. It'd be horrible.
[29:10.050 --> 29:11.750]  I couldn't sit down for a week.
[29:12.030 --> 29:14.370]  Imagine doing that and then having to go play how many
[29:14.370 --> 29:16.270]  minutes of professional basketball. Good luck.
[29:16.430 --> 29:18.290]  I couldn't do it. Patrick Beverley.
[29:18.670 --> 29:20.650]  Hey, Pat Bev. My favorite
[29:20.650 --> 29:22.830]  player. He's always got something to say
[29:22.830 --> 29:24.810]  no matter what. Pure passion.
[29:25.590 --> 29:26.610]  One of my favorite
[29:26.610 --> 29:28.190]  moments of this season was
[29:28.190 --> 29:30.250]  the NBA on TNT guy.
[29:30.390 --> 29:32.890]  Trash was great. That was great.
[29:33.330 --> 29:34.610]  That was really
[29:34.610 --> 29:36.730]  fun. But it was when
[29:36.730 --> 29:38.610]  Shaq and Charles
[29:38.610 --> 29:40.590]  Barkley were clowning on him because he was crying
[29:40.590 --> 29:42.610]  and hugging his mom after they got into
[29:42.610 --> 29:44.770]  the play-in game.
[29:45.150 --> 29:46.030]  They're like, it's not the playoffs.
[29:47.430 --> 29:48.870]  It's not even the playoffs.
[29:48.870 --> 29:50.290]  Luke Kennard.
[29:52.070 --> 29:53.110]  Kelvin Johnson.
[29:53.890 --> 29:54.830]  DeAndre Ayton.
[29:55.290 --> 29:56.610]  Give that man his money.
[29:57.110 --> 29:58.330]  And James Booknight, rookie.
[29:58.490 --> 29:59.470]  Nice laser.
[30:05.170 --> 30:06.370]  Nailed it. That was perfect.
[30:07.010 --> 30:07.430]  Oh no.
[30:08.770 --> 30:10.590]  It's my favorite sound on the board.
[30:11.090 --> 30:12.230]  It's so funny.
[30:12.350 --> 30:14.870]  It's funny because we have one Gavin on the sound
[30:14.870 --> 30:17.070]  board and it's kind of like having one Gavin.
[30:17.270 --> 30:18.790]  Well, it's like him being here
[30:18.790 --> 30:20.350]  because what's he going to say about
[30:20.350 --> 30:21.470]  James Booknight?
[30:21.850 --> 30:24.910]  Gavin, you got any James Booknight fans?
[30:26.050 --> 30:26.530]  He's like,
[30:26.690 --> 30:28.550]  Booknight looks more like
[30:28.550 --> 30:29.750]  Magazine Day.
[30:32.530 --> 30:34.690]  There we go. Peyton Pritchard. Still waiting for him
[30:34.690 --> 30:36.470]  to show up in the series. Jason Tatum
[30:36.470 --> 30:38.030]  would like him to show up again tonight.
[30:38.950 --> 30:40.970]  Here we got Kendrick Nunn.
[30:41.190 --> 30:42.890]  He now plays for the Lakers, I believe.
[30:44.390 --> 30:45.170]  J'shawn Tate.
[30:45.450 --> 30:46.710]  Love J'shawn Tate.
[30:46.710 --> 30:47.350]  Giannis.
[30:48.190 --> 30:49.130]  I like him.
[30:49.450 --> 30:52.270]  I like him except for right now. I'll like him again
[30:52.270 --> 30:53.430]  in a couple days maybe.
[30:54.650 --> 30:56.450]  Devin Booker had a phenomenal game last night.
[31:00.380 --> 31:01.460]  Something's marmy about him.
[31:01.760 --> 31:04.640]  Something's wearing me down about him.
[31:05.360 --> 31:06.400]  Yeah, I don't know what it is.
[31:06.420 --> 31:07.120]  Think he's too clean cut?
[31:07.900 --> 31:08.880]  He is kind of clean cut.
[31:09.800 --> 31:11.220]  He's kind of got that...
[31:13.480 --> 31:14.360]  He's kind of got that
[31:18.080 --> 31:18.440]  like...
[31:18.440 --> 31:20.160]  I don't know how to describe it.
[31:21.120 --> 31:22.280]  Gordon Hayward has it too.
[31:22.580 --> 31:24.180]  Where you just like...
[31:24.180 --> 31:26.120]  He's like smug
[31:26.120 --> 31:27.580]  and breaks the rules.
[31:27.700 --> 31:28.980]  I didn't do that.
[31:30.700 --> 31:32.000]  It's just an attitude.
[31:32.200 --> 31:33.900]  I don't know. It's wearing me out though in the playoffs.
[31:35.060 --> 31:35.900]  Who we got there?
[31:35.980 --> 31:36.700]  I can't even read that.
[31:38.740 --> 31:39.740]  Oh, Nimaeus Keita.
[31:40.400 --> 31:41.980]  And then Bam Adebayo.
[31:42.520 --> 31:44.360]  Power in the paint insert.
[31:44.540 --> 31:46.500]  I hope he doesn't bring that power in a couple days
[31:46.500 --> 31:48.140]  when he plays against hopefully the Celtics.
[31:49.300 --> 31:51.340]  Bam has been a tough matchup for us.
[31:51.640 --> 31:53.020]  Hopefully we have Rob Williams back.
[31:53.700 --> 31:54.080]  Okay.
[31:54.760 --> 31:55.220]  Okay.
[31:56.080 --> 31:58.260]  Moving along. Here we have PJ Washington Jr.
[31:59.160 --> 32:00.280]  Jay Crowder
[32:00.280 --> 32:02.100]  getting beat up in the playoffs right now.
[32:02.400 --> 32:03.680]  Ex-Celtic by the way.
[32:03.740 --> 32:04.920]  Trey Young.
[32:07.100 --> 32:08.220]  Doug McDermott.
[32:08.400 --> 32:09.480]  PJ Warren.
[32:09.920 --> 32:11.260]  Kyle Anderson.
[32:11.680 --> 32:14.780]  Dennis Schroeder is a rocket I believe now.
[32:14.780 --> 32:16.260]  And Jalen Brunson
[32:16.660 --> 32:19.080]  who is playing his heart out in the playoffs right now.
[32:19.280 --> 32:20.360]  You're keeping all of the...
[32:20.360 --> 32:21.820]  Oh, I guess you are keeping all of those cards.
[32:21.960 --> 32:23.900]  Oh, I wasn't even paying attention. I'm not.
[32:24.440 --> 32:25.140]  I'll deal with it later.
[32:26.540 --> 32:27.560]  You're right. You're right.
[32:28.000 --> 32:29.120]  I fucked that up.
[32:30.040 --> 32:31.320]  Okay. Gary Trent Jr.
[32:31.560 --> 32:33.980]  Cam Johnson. He needs to find a shot.
[32:34.100 --> 32:36.000]  Although maybe he doesn't because it would be cool if Dallas won.
[32:36.640 --> 32:37.440]  Nikola Jokic.
[32:38.060 --> 32:40.580]  Seti Osman. Killian Hayes.
[32:40.900 --> 32:41.900]  Carmelo Anthony.
[32:41.900 --> 32:44.020]  Let's see where he's going to be playing next year.
[32:44.400 --> 32:45.120]  Jared Butler.
[32:46.020 --> 32:47.340]  Oh, I think he's playing.
[32:49.020 --> 32:49.900]  Yeka Okungwu.
[32:50.080 --> 32:50.760]  Second year card.
[32:51.120 --> 32:52.120]  That's a cool looking one.
[32:58.780 --> 33:00.180]  Yeah, I think he wants...
[33:00.180 --> 33:01.340]  I think Melo...
[33:01.340 --> 33:03.440]  He's at that phase in his career where he
[33:03.440 --> 33:06.060]  wants to win a title and he doesn't really have
[33:06.060 --> 33:08.040]  any allegiance to anything other than getting that ring.
[33:08.180 --> 33:10.420]  So he can just go be a six man somewhere.
[33:11.260 --> 33:12.020]  Jared Jackson.
[33:12.860 --> 33:13.620]  Tyrese Halliburton.
[33:15.060 --> 33:16.320]  Weirdest thing in the world to me
[33:16.320 --> 33:17.340]  that he's an Indiana Pacer now.
[33:17.720 --> 33:18.760]  Joel Embiid.
[33:19.380 --> 33:20.720]  Keeps getting hit in the face.
[33:20.980 --> 33:22.740]  He got hit in the first quarter last night.
[33:22.920 --> 33:24.080]  It took him out of the rest of the game.
[33:24.480 --> 33:25.920]  Josh Jackson. He was there, but he wasn't there.
[33:26.020 --> 33:28.280]  Kyle Lowry. He's also not there right now.
[33:29.880 --> 33:30.640]  John Wall.
[33:30.840 --> 33:33.500]  Boy, he has disappeared from the NBA for a while.
[33:33.980 --> 33:34.660]  Chris Middleton.
[33:35.040 --> 33:37.000]  And then, for some reason,
[33:37.140 --> 33:37.940]  Colin Sexton.
[33:39.300 --> 33:40.360]  This is one of the
[33:40.360 --> 33:42.300]  ugliest insert series they have.
[33:42.520 --> 33:42.880]  Lay that down.
[33:44.980 --> 33:45.960]  It's just like grey.
[33:46.420 --> 33:48.260]  It looks like you're looking
[33:48.260 --> 33:49.340]  at it on an ugly TV.
[33:49.520 --> 33:52.220]  Yeah, it's like live in 4-3 from 1986.
[33:54.460 --> 33:55.740]  You're just keeping all of them.
[33:56.020 --> 33:57.100]  I'll deal with it later.
[33:59.020 --> 34:00.120]  I'm not going to deal with it later.
[34:00.320 --> 34:01.800]  No, absolutely not.
[34:02.000 --> 34:03.480]  You're going to look at those stacks and go,
[34:03.620 --> 34:04.480]  why did we keep all these?
[34:04.480 --> 34:05.800]  I'm in a hurry when I get out of here.
[34:08.300 --> 34:09.220]  Tristan Thompson.
[34:09.540 --> 34:11.580]  Keep it on the court, buddy.
[34:11.820 --> 34:13.100]  Make your life less complicated.
[34:13.540 --> 34:16.400]  Steph Curry. Andrew Wiggins.
[34:16.540 --> 34:17.400]  Oh, look at them back-to-back.
[34:17.860 --> 34:20.000]  Dejounte Murray. James Wiseman.
[34:20.400 --> 34:22.740]  This is the fucking Warriors pack, apparently.
[34:22.880 --> 34:24.620]  Anthony Davis. Or the pack of
[34:24.620 --> 34:25.600]  big dudes who are hurt.
[34:27.440 --> 34:28.640]  James Booknight rookie
[34:28.640 --> 34:30.640]  again. And then Jalen Green,
[34:31.280 --> 34:32.360]  who I think would have had
[34:32.940 --> 34:34.460]  a better year. I think he got hurt
[34:34.960 --> 34:35.680]  halfway through.
[34:36.360 --> 34:37.540]  How are we doing on those packs?
[34:37.940 --> 34:39.600]  Oh, dude, we're down to
[34:40.180 --> 34:42.100]  two, three of the NBA.
[34:42.360 --> 34:43.420]  And then we'll move on to something else.
[34:45.380 --> 34:46.340]  RJ Barrett.
[34:46.740 --> 34:48.080]  Bogdan Bogdanovich.
[34:51.300 --> 34:52.700]  Kenyon Martin Jr.
[34:53.220 --> 34:54.580]  Here we got Reggie Bullock.
[34:56.740 --> 34:58.320]  He could improve a little bit.
[34:59.840 --> 35:00.800]  Danilo Gallinari.
[35:00.800 --> 35:01.340]  I'm just saying,
[35:03.860 --> 35:04.780]  Dallas needs him.
[35:05.020 --> 35:06.380]  They need to hit some threes.
[35:06.700 --> 35:07.580]  Wendell Carter Jr.
[35:08.320 --> 35:10.560]  Norman Powell. And then Alexey
[35:10.560 --> 35:11.500]  Pokachevsky.
[35:12.300 --> 35:13.520]  What a name.
[35:14.160 --> 35:16.420]  He's got it all. He's like 7'2",
[35:16.420 --> 35:17.520]  weighs 108 pounds.
[35:19.180 --> 35:20.180]  Alexey Pokachevsky.
[35:20.260 --> 35:21.320]  If a bird was a man.
[35:23.660 --> 35:26.200]  Alright, down to the
[35:26.630 --> 35:28.060]  second to the last pack.
[35:28.060 --> 35:29.100]  Eric, it's getting intense.
[35:29.580 --> 35:31.960]  Where's our hit gonna come? Draymond Green, Jordan
[35:31.960 --> 35:33.980]  Poole. I appreciate that you think there's a hit
[35:33.980 --> 35:34.920]  that's coming. That's pretty cool.
[35:35.260 --> 35:38.220]  Boban has had a tremendous
[35:38.220 --> 35:39.920]  career in commercials lately. He is
[35:39.920 --> 35:42.240]  killing it. So what is that? Why is he
[35:42.240 --> 35:43.980]  everywhere? He's in the trailer
[35:43.980 --> 35:46.240]  for that new fucking Adam Sandler movie.
[35:46.600 --> 35:48.040]  Yes. The Hustle
[35:48.040 --> 35:50.140]  or some shit? Hustle, with Juancho
[35:50.140 --> 35:52.200]  Hernan Gomez as the
[35:52.200 --> 35:53.460]  protagonist, who has
[35:54.060 --> 35:55.940]  just ridden the benches his entire NBA career.
[35:55.940 --> 35:57.880]  I am from Spain.
[35:58.320 --> 36:00.000]  That's all of his
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.520]  acting. And then him, he's like,
[36:01.820 --> 36:02.640]  I'm 22.
[36:04.160 --> 36:06.100]  Yeah, he's like, I'm 22. That's my 12-year-old
[36:06.100 --> 36:08.000]  self. He's Luka's best
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.280]  friend too, I think, right? Yeah.
[36:10.020 --> 36:10.820]  Cole Anthony.
[36:12.340 --> 36:13.320]  Cole Anthony did
[36:13.820 --> 36:15.300]  the dunk contest this year
[36:15.300 --> 36:18.000]  in boots. That was like his big thing.
[36:18.060 --> 36:20.260]  He did them in timber ones. The dunk contest
[36:20.260 --> 36:21.980]  is so like... yeah, I guess so.
[36:22.140 --> 36:23.600]  His dad is a famous dunker.
[36:24.180 --> 36:25.480]  His dad is...
[36:25.480 --> 36:27.600]  he was on those NBA... or not those NBA, but
[36:27.600 --> 36:29.340]  those dunk leagues that we go around. Oh, really?
[36:29.580 --> 36:31.200]  Yeah, his dad's... I can't remember his name, but he's
[36:31.200 --> 36:33.520]  the most famous guy. He's like an and-one
[36:33.520 --> 36:35.120]  dude? Yeah, he's an and-one dude. Oh, that's crazy.
[36:35.400 --> 36:36.020]  Absolutely. Oh, wow.
[36:40.280 --> 36:40.840]  Malcolm Brogdon.
[36:43.240 --> 36:43.520]  Facundo
[36:44.740 --> 36:45.520]  Campazo. Facundo's a great
[36:45.520 --> 36:47.520]  name to say. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's a
[36:47.520 --> 36:49.460]  keepable card. That's all I'm saying. I mean, we're just
[36:49.460 --> 36:51.360]  keeping all of them, so it doesn't matter, but yeah, sure.
[36:52.260 --> 36:52.780]  Uh...
[36:53.360 --> 36:55.360]  Santi Aldama, I've never heard
[36:55.360 --> 36:57.400]  of, and then Kelly Oubre Jr.
[36:57.660 --> 36:58.820]  Alright. Uh, they
[36:59.140 --> 37:01.420]  refer to him as the NBA's Mr. Stelio
[37:01.420 --> 37:03.080]  Girl. I love it. Yeah.
[37:03.260 --> 37:04.300]  That's his reputation.
[37:05.360 --> 37:07.420]  So, I guess Nick Young no longer
[37:07.420 --> 37:08.640]  has that. His reputation.
[37:10.740 --> 37:13.440]  Last pack on these cards.
[37:13.520 --> 37:15.300]  On these cards. Andre Drummond.
[37:15.400 --> 37:16.960]  Ooh. Uh...
[37:16.960 --> 37:19.360]  Ricky Rubio. Alright. Terrible sad story
[37:19.360 --> 37:21.080]  about Ricky Rubio. Devonta Sabonis.
[37:21.380 --> 37:23.760]  Gordon Hayward. It's kind of like, hmm...
[37:23.760 --> 37:25.420]  Elbow somebody, and then he's like,
[37:25.480 --> 37:26.560]  oh, they hurt me.
[37:27.120 --> 37:28.960]  Dude, you elbowed him.
[37:29.480 --> 37:30.880]  Terrence Mann. Tyler Hero.
[37:31.520 --> 37:33.300]  Kevin Love. Can't stand Tyler Hero.
[37:33.820 --> 37:35.100]  Yeah, he's got it. He's...
[37:37.060 --> 37:37.540]  Eric...
[37:37.540 --> 37:39.360]  Not Eric. I think Andrew said
[37:39.360 --> 37:41.100]  he's got the most punchable face.
[37:41.200 --> 37:43.140]  He does. He's like if it...
[37:43.140 --> 37:45.500]  We gotta go back to that card. Yeah, let's go back to that. He is like
[37:45.500 --> 37:47.300]  if a Twitch streamer was an
[37:47.300 --> 37:49.500]  NBA player, just bothers
[37:49.500 --> 37:51.420]  the shit out of me. Everything about
[37:51.420 --> 37:53.400]  him is like... It's not like
[37:53.400 --> 37:55.120]  he talks a lot or does anything.
[37:55.280 --> 37:57.320]  There's just something about him where I go, I don't
[37:57.320 --> 37:59.060]  like you. Yeah. I just don't like you.
[37:59.140 --> 38:01.300]  I read up five things about me, about Tyler Hero
[38:01.300 --> 38:03.380]  once, and I think number four was
[38:03.380 --> 38:05.020]  I'm a bit of a dog.
[38:05.160 --> 38:07.080]  He just... And I'm like, that
[38:07.080 --> 38:09.320]  turned me off a bit. He just looks like he has opinions
[38:09.320 --> 38:11.000]  about Fortnite Zero Build. Yeah.
[38:11.060 --> 38:13.000]  It's just like, shut up. Oh, what's that last card?
[38:13.440 --> 38:14.460]  Oh, sorry. Yeah, it was
[38:15.920 --> 38:16.560]  Santi Aldama
[38:16.560 --> 38:18.180]  but the laser parallel.
[38:18.560 --> 38:20.560]  Oh, it's that one! Same dude again. Oh, that's fun!
[38:21.620 --> 38:22.500]  Yeah, he's like
[38:22.500 --> 38:24.460]  people are like, if you have to tell people
[38:24.460 --> 38:26.220]  that's who you are, that's not who you are.
[38:26.920 --> 38:27.820]  I'm a bit of a dog.
[38:28.260 --> 38:29.840]  I'm a bit tough. I just don't
[38:29.840 --> 38:31.060]  care for that guy.
[38:32.480 --> 38:34.460]  Well, that was a lot of basketball. That was a lot of basketball.
[38:34.500 --> 38:35.520]  You wanna switch it up? Yeah, let's do it.
[38:35.740 --> 38:37.960]  I got for you two packs of
[38:37.960 --> 38:40.360]  wrestling cards. Wow, NXT and WWE!
[38:40.980 --> 38:42.460]  Which one is better, NXT
[38:42.460 --> 38:44.020]  or WWE? Well, they're both WWE.
[38:44.420 --> 38:45.280]  Which one is better?
[38:46.620 --> 38:48.480]  I don't know. I guess. I mean, at this point
[38:48.480 --> 38:49.720]  it's different wrestlers, right?
[38:50.440 --> 38:52.320]  Yeah, but all of these people are
[38:52.320 --> 38:54.320]  like here now. So this is like the farm team?
[38:54.320 --> 38:56.420]  Yeah, that's the way it started, but now it's
[38:56.420 --> 38:58.180]  just another brand, so whatever. But like,
[38:58.300 --> 39:00.120]  NXT was more fun to watch a couple years ago.
[39:00.200 --> 39:02.340]  It was really good. Do you still watch it now?
[39:02.600 --> 39:04.480]  Not NXT, no. Does it
[39:04.480 --> 39:06.300]  come on still? Yeah. Oh yeah, it's still on TV.
[39:06.460 --> 39:08.120]  It's just not...
[39:08.120 --> 39:10.300]  They really changed up too much about it, and it's just not
[39:10.300 --> 39:12.200]  very exciting. So you say no
[39:12.200 --> 39:14.440]  to wrestling stuff? A lot of WWE
[39:14.440 --> 39:16.260]  stuff I don't really watch anymore. Really? Yeah, I watch
[39:16.260 --> 39:17.880]  a lot of independent stuff and like a lot of AEW.
[39:18.120 --> 39:20.100]  So you're an AEW and independent fan?
[39:20.180 --> 39:22.360]  Yeah, there's an independent wrestling show coming up in Austin
[39:22.360 --> 39:24.280]  that I'm really excited about. Is it
[39:24.280 --> 39:26.380]  the WrestleCircus people again? No, WrestleCircus
[39:26.380 --> 39:28.400]  is gone. Oh. Yeah, they're gone forever.
[39:28.760 --> 39:30.160]  It's called Inspire Pro Wrestling,
[39:30.320 --> 39:32.040]  and I think they have a show like in June.
[39:32.820 --> 39:34.260]  I'm excited about that. But you said you're going
[39:34.260 --> 39:36.260]  to Vegas for... I am, I'm going to
[39:37.060 --> 39:37.960]  AEW... Oh, that's AEW.
[39:37.960 --> 39:39.940]  AEW. Yeah, so I'm excited
[39:39.940 --> 39:41.840]  about that. That'll be fun. Something to do.
[39:42.360 --> 39:43.980]  But do you occasionally watch WWE?
[39:44.360 --> 39:45.780]  Yeah, I guess like... Keep tabs?
[39:47.000 --> 39:47.940]  Watching it on Twitter is
[39:47.940 --> 39:49.480]  a lot easier than sitting through a three-hour show.
[39:50.160 --> 39:50.920]  Gotcha. You know? Gotcha.
[39:52.220 --> 39:54.020]  You're probably familiar with Jackson Riker.
[39:55.980 --> 39:58.020]  Jackson Riker, noted MAGA guy.
[39:58.300 --> 39:58.700]  Oh!
[39:59.860 --> 40:01.840]  Definitely was like on the roster
[40:01.840 --> 40:03.840]  and they're calling him up and all this stuff, and then he's
[40:03.840 --> 40:06.020]  like, that's my president
[40:06.020 --> 40:07.260]  on the last guy.
[40:07.880 --> 40:09.880]  And everyone's like, we don't like this guy, we don't
[40:09.880 --> 40:12.040]  work with him, so they fired him. Wow. So what's he doing now?
[40:12.480 --> 40:13.800]  Probably independent stuff in
[40:14.400 --> 40:16.240]  the south. The northeast.
[40:16.500 --> 40:17.980]  Where everyone... Wrestling... What was it called?
[40:18.220 --> 40:19.120]  Wrestle Illuminati?
[40:20.600 --> 40:21.960]  Yeah, the Wrestle
[40:21.960 --> 40:24.220]  Illuminati. There's
[40:24.220 --> 40:25.940]  Choose Your Narrative, and I think he would fit there
[40:25.940 --> 40:27.380]  really well. It's a different thing.
[40:27.780 --> 40:29.140]  How about these dudes?
[40:29.660 --> 40:31.940]  Oh! It's Baron Corbin and the Dirty
[40:31.940 --> 40:32.460]  Dogs.
[40:33.480 --> 40:33.880]  It's...
[40:33.880 --> 40:36.300]  Is that Big Bob Rude?
[40:37.060 --> 40:38.640]  Yeah, Bobby Rude, Dolph Ziggler
[40:38.640 --> 40:40.660]  and Baron Corbin. They were a team for a little
[40:40.660 --> 40:42.680]  while. Did they lay the smackdown?
[40:42.880 --> 40:44.240]  Uh, yeah. Yes.
[40:44.560 --> 40:46.660]  Do you know about this lady? Dana Brooke, I think
[40:46.660 --> 40:48.620]  is married to an NBA player, or was married to an
[40:48.620 --> 40:49.940]  NBA player, I don't remember who.
[40:50.980 --> 40:52.160]  Maybe it says in the back.
[40:52.280 --> 40:54.860]  Probably not. An award-winning bodybuilder,
[40:54.940 --> 40:56.340]  she's proving herself to be a top competitor in the WWE.
[40:56.600 --> 40:57.860]  Does she still compete?
[40:58.280 --> 41:00.460]  Yeah, I think she's the 24-7
[41:00.460 --> 41:02.420]  champion right now. She's got a keen mind.
[41:02.720 --> 41:03.840]  Keen mind. Way to go, man.
[41:04.060 --> 41:06.200]  She's got a keen mind. Yeah, uh-huh. I said that
[41:06.560 --> 41:08.180]  all. Yeah, no, you're slam dunking it, baby.
[41:08.600 --> 41:09.980]  It's a slow stroke.
[41:10.700 --> 41:12.120]  It's happening in stages. Uh-huh.
[41:13.020 --> 41:14.500]  Once determined to be crowned a singles
[41:14.500 --> 41:15.560]  champion, oh, hey, Geoff.
[41:16.380 --> 41:18.540]  Dana now seeks the WWE Women's
[41:18.540 --> 41:20.360]  Tag Team Champion with Mandy Rose.
[41:20.540 --> 41:21.840]  She did for a while, but not anymore.
[41:22.100 --> 41:24.400]  Did they have a falling out? I think they just sort of broke
[41:24.400 --> 41:25.080]  them up and it didn't matter.
[41:25.720 --> 41:27.120]  Are you familiar with these people?
[41:27.120 --> 41:29.340]  Is that Sasha Banks and Roman Reigns?
[41:29.520 --> 41:31.000]  Yeah. Yeah, I think that's from the
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.060]  Mixed Match Challenge thing that they were doing.
[41:33.280 --> 41:35.000]  It's good. Sasha Banks is great.
[41:35.240 --> 41:37.180]  Roman Reigns is good. And then that person. Rhea Ripley
[41:37.180 --> 41:39.140]  is cool. She's Australian and she does
[41:39.140 --> 41:41.140]  she's like all metal and she just
[41:41.140 --> 41:42.420]  joined a bad guy team.
[41:43.380 --> 41:45.020]  She's like the wrestling ACDC.
[41:45.620 --> 41:47.240]  Yeah, you know what? Yeah, she does
[41:47.240 --> 41:49.120]  dirty deeds. Doesn't dirt cheap. It really
[41:49.120 --> 41:49.540]  works out.
[41:50.920 --> 41:53.000]  Oh, it's acknowledge
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.520]  me, Roman Reigns.
[41:55.900 --> 41:56.640]  That's like the guy.
[41:56.800 --> 41:58.520]  That's The Rock's cousin. He's going to fight The Rock at Wrestlemania
[41:58.520 --> 42:00.480]  next year, I think. I got a rookie. The Rock still
[42:00.480 --> 42:01.480]  fights? No.
[42:02.520 --> 42:04.580]  But he's going to come back to put Roman Reigns
[42:04.580 --> 42:06.540]  over to make him like the
[42:06.540 --> 42:08.440]  guy. First off, I got a rookie
[42:08.440 --> 42:10.360]  card, which is exciting. Okay, who is it?
[42:10.480 --> 42:12.520]  But also, this may be one of the worst photos I've ever seen.
[42:12.900 --> 42:14.040]  I don't want to throw this your way.
[42:14.380 --> 42:16.280]  Oh, it's Omos! Just a dude
[42:16.280 --> 42:18.620]  in a turtleneck. He's like 7'2".
[42:19.740 --> 42:20.300]  That's a big
[42:20.300 --> 42:22.460]  turtleneck. That's like his
[42:22.460 --> 42:23.620]  thing. He's like a big
[42:24.500 --> 42:26.500]  guy. So he's like, I'm wearing this shirt because it's the only
[42:26.500 --> 42:28.420]  shirt that fits me. For some reason,
[42:28.520 --> 42:30.560]  that was the thing he would wear, like a coat
[42:30.560 --> 42:32.360]  and a shirt. It would just be like,
[42:32.460 --> 42:34.020]  I'm big, and that would be it.
[42:34.280 --> 42:36.560]  I don't know. But that's fine. I mean, cool.
[42:36.740 --> 42:38.480]  I guess. Yeah, the beach is
[42:38.480 --> 42:40.540]  on. Yeah, let's see what's in those NXT cards. I'm sure
[42:40.540 --> 42:42.460]  there's something fun there.
[42:42.700 --> 42:44.520]  Most of the people in that are in WWE now,
[42:44.600 --> 42:46.380]  so it's in what they call the main
[42:46.380 --> 42:48.720]  roster, so it's on Raw and SmackDown,
[42:48.840 --> 42:50.420]  but also NXT is on TV,
[42:50.420 --> 42:50.920]  so whatever.
[42:53.500 --> 42:54.380]  Let's see how many people
[42:54.380 --> 42:56.480]  in this pack are fire. Okay, let's see.
[42:56.800 --> 42:58.420]  First off, we have Kushida
[42:58.420 --> 43:00.460]  and Timothy Thatcher. Neither one of them work
[43:00.460 --> 43:02.380]  at this company anymore. Oh, really? Yes,
[43:02.400 --> 43:04.160]  they are both gone. Great wrestlers.
[43:04.480 --> 43:05.700]  What are they in the independent...
[43:06.420 --> 43:08.560]  Illuminati now? I think Kushida is going back
[43:08.560 --> 43:10.580]  to New Japan, and then Timothy Thatcher will work
[43:10.580 --> 43:11.820]  everywhere. He's really good.
[43:12.500 --> 43:14.460]  Bronson Reed no longer works there. His name
[43:14.460 --> 43:16.520]  is Jonah Rock, and he wrestles in New Japan
[43:16.520 --> 43:20.400]  Pro Wrestling. Oh, we
[43:20.400 --> 43:22.120]  have one more for... Ooh, Legado de
[43:22.120 --> 43:22.760]  Fantasma.
[43:24.860 --> 43:25.740]  This guy,
[43:26.140 --> 43:27.940]  Santos Escobar, was in
[43:27.940 --> 43:30.100]  Lucha Underground as King Cuerno.
[43:30.620 --> 43:32.100]  He picked up a victory there. Oh, way
[43:32.100 --> 43:34.040]  to go, man. How about this one?
[43:34.740 --> 43:35.940]  Is that Karrion Kross?
[43:36.060 --> 43:37.940]  No longer in WWE. He
[43:37.940 --> 43:39.860]  wrestles for Choose Your Narrative, which
[43:39.860 --> 43:41.540]  is the coolest wrestling company
[43:41.540 --> 43:43.900]  where it's guys... where they put like a disclaimer
[43:43.900 --> 43:45.740]  at the front, and they go, this is for
[43:45.740 --> 43:47.880]  free thinkers. And you go,
[43:47.880 --> 43:48.380]  yeah.
[43:49.840 --> 43:51.560]  So, it's like, it's
[43:51.560 --> 43:54.020]  bad wrestling rules. And there's money in that
[43:54.020 --> 43:55.940]  for them? No. Oh. That's
[43:55.940 --> 43:57.120]  the best part. Oh.
[43:57.440 --> 43:57.800]  Okay.
[43:59.600 --> 44:01.860]  Oh, Piper Niven. She's
[44:01.860 --> 44:03.860]  I think Dewdrop in WWE. She still
[44:03.860 --> 44:05.380]  works there. Dewdrop. Good for her.
[44:07.080 --> 44:07.700]  Who's that?
[44:07.840 --> 44:09.880]  Oh, is that Adam Cole? He's in AEW
[44:09.880 --> 44:11.840]  now, so that's cool. He's like the guy.
[44:11.980 --> 44:13.480]  He's like one of the guys over there. And this guy,
[44:13.780 --> 44:15.640]  Roderick Strong. Roderick Strong
[44:16.500 --> 44:17.380]  is still
[44:17.380 --> 44:19.240]  in NXT,
[44:19.620 --> 44:21.640]  and is this referee...
[44:22.240 --> 44:23.640]  Yeah, that's Drake Younger, who
[44:23.640 --> 44:25.300]  turned out to be a weird maggot guy too.
[44:25.620 --> 44:27.580]  The referee? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He started
[44:27.580 --> 44:29.640]  like, he started like going
[44:29.640 --> 44:31.700]  to like school board meetings
[44:31.700 --> 44:33.660]  and city council meetings and stuff, and going like
[44:33.660 --> 44:35.620]  we need to like stop our children
[44:35.620 --> 44:37.620]  from these evil acts that the
[44:37.620 --> 44:39.340]  Democrats are coming for the children.
[44:39.480 --> 44:41.620]  It was like, oh, he's nuts. Oh, he's trying to save
[44:41.620 --> 44:42.740]  the kids. Yeah, it was pretty exciting.
[44:42.740 --> 44:43.900]  It was pretty exciting.
[44:44.840 --> 44:46.740]  Alright, Eric, I think we have 15
[44:46.740 --> 44:48.680]  minutes left. We have time for the revolution.
[44:49.080 --> 44:50.800]  The big thing left, but first I'm going to show
[44:50.800 --> 44:52.320]  I was going to do some more... Oh, you got some show and tell?
[44:52.560 --> 44:54.760]  Yeah, I thought I'd show some fun cards. Okay. I don't know if I've
[44:54.760 --> 44:56.740]  ever shown this one. I bought this for us a while back.
[44:56.820 --> 44:58.860]  Okay. I don't know if I ever showed it on a break
[44:58.860 --> 45:00.720]  stuff, so I'm going to show it here. Let's see. This is a famous
[45:00.720 --> 45:02.520]  card. It's
[45:02.520 --> 45:04.880]  June Bong and Brandon Puffer.
[45:05.360 --> 45:06.660]  And the reason this is a famous
[45:06.660 --> 45:08.760]  card is because the guy who
[45:09.260 --> 45:10.720]  saw the opportunity in Tops to
[45:10.720 --> 45:12.260]  put these two players together, even though
[45:12.260 --> 45:14.520]  one played for the Braves and one played for the Astros,
[45:14.900 --> 45:16.420]  they had no connection whatsoever.
[45:17.000 --> 45:18.460]  But he wanted to have a card that said
[45:18.460 --> 45:20.360]  Bong Puffer. Whoa!
[45:23.160 --> 45:23.880]  That's awesome!
[45:24.360 --> 45:26.840]  That's a great card. I paid like $35 for that.
[45:26.860 --> 45:28.380]  That's a great card. The Bong Puffer card.
[45:28.420 --> 45:30.600]  Dude, that's awesome. Famous. And it's actually a Puffer
[45:30.600 --> 45:32.800]  Bong and he tried to get a flip and they were like, don't push your luck.
[45:33.560 --> 45:34.180]  And he was like, okay.
[45:34.600 --> 45:36.620]  So it came out Puffer Bong. That's so cool.
[45:37.180 --> 45:38.460]  Famous Bong Puffer card. Damn!
[45:39.380 --> 45:40.580]  Solely exists this card
[45:40.580 --> 45:42.640]  so that guy could make that joke. That's really fun.
[45:42.740 --> 45:44.520]  That's very fuckface. Yeah.
[45:44.520 --> 45:46.280]  Yeah, big time. Gotta really appreciate that.
[45:46.300 --> 45:48.740]  I think he'd also quit when he did it. Yeah, I bet.
[45:48.920 --> 45:50.460]  He was on his way out. Then I thought it'd be
[45:50.460 --> 45:51.680]  fun to do some more of this.
[45:52.260 --> 45:54.220]  I showed this in the fuckface break...
[45:54.220 --> 45:56.200]  Oh, that's right! But this is a
[45:56.200 --> 45:58.500]  close-up of the Ian stamp, the medium
[45:58.500 --> 46:00.680]  I think we're gonna go with. So when we do
[46:00.680 --> 46:02.460]  runs again where we give away cards,
[46:02.600 --> 46:03.920]  I'll stamp these. Yep.
[46:05.580 --> 46:06.520]  And you guys
[46:06.520 --> 46:07.980]  can get them. They look great. That's awesome.
[46:08.460 --> 46:10.640]  And then, from time to time
[46:10.640 --> 46:11.840]  we get redemptions. Okay.
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.540]  Which is, you've seen, we get
[46:14.540 --> 46:16.480]  them in these card, in these break shows or in the daily
[46:16.480 --> 46:18.600]  reps, where it's just a card that says, like, mail this in
[46:18.600 --> 46:20.640]  and we'll send you the actual card. Well, I've gotten some in
[46:20.640 --> 46:22.740]  so I thought I'd share them. Garrett Mitchell,
[46:22.880 --> 46:24.700]  I got this redemption recently
[46:26.040 --> 46:26.680]  in a
[46:26.680 --> 46:28.700]  daily rep. And you can see this is an on-card
[46:28.700 --> 46:30.540]  auto, actually. Very cool. And that's what it looks like
[46:30.540 --> 46:31.860]  when you get a Topps redemption.
[46:32.660 --> 46:33.980]  It's a little sealed Topps thing.
[46:34.640 --> 46:35.260]  It's pretty cool.
[46:35.520 --> 46:38.240]  This is what it looks like when you get one from Panini.
[46:38.840 --> 46:39.940]  It comes in a one-touch.
[46:40.060 --> 46:41.840]  This is an autographed Obi Toppin
[46:42.820 --> 46:43.760]  contender numbered rookie.
[46:44.300 --> 46:46.000]  And this is on-card as well. Why is it called
[46:46.000 --> 46:47.920]  one-touch? Well, because it's
[46:48.780 --> 46:50.040]  magnetized. So you open it,
[46:50.160 --> 46:52.080]  stick the card in, close it, and you only ever touch
[46:52.080 --> 46:53.100]  the card once. Oh, wow.
[46:54.080 --> 46:55.620]  Anyway, it's pretty cool.
[46:55.700 --> 46:57.840]  So that's what redemptions, when you finally get them, because I know I've
[46:57.840 --> 46:59.580]  pulled both of these in, break shits.
[47:00.300 --> 47:02.060]  That's what they come in and actually look like.
[47:02.060 --> 47:03.960]  That's pretty cool. I don't think I've ever seen that before.
[47:04.100 --> 47:06.060]  I feel like redemption things
[47:06.060 --> 47:08.080]  are things where they're
[47:08.080 --> 47:09.940]  like, yeah, mail this back. And most people go,
[47:10.040 --> 47:12.520]  yeah, I can't wait. And then never fucking do it.
[47:12.640 --> 47:14.100]  And then sometimes it takes
[47:14.100 --> 47:15.660]  up to like two or three years to get them. Wow.
[47:15.720 --> 47:17.060]  I got pretty lucky with those. That's crazy.
[47:17.540 --> 47:19.960]  Alright, so this is the overpriced, too
[47:19.960 --> 47:22.560]  expensive, 2021,
[47:23.520 --> 47:23.880]  2022
[47:25.020 --> 47:25.740]  NBA Revolution
[47:27.320 --> 47:27.680]  Panini
[47:28.440 --> 47:30.100]  Hobby Box. Five cards
[47:30.100 --> 47:31.900]  per pack, eight packs.
[47:32.120 --> 47:34.040]  Wow, there's not a lot of cards.
[47:34.320 --> 47:36.300]  Hey, Brian, we were right. How much was this box?
[47:37.000 --> 47:37.800]  This box
[47:37.800 --> 47:40.060]  set us back, and by us I mean me.
[47:40.060 --> 47:41.580]  Yeah, you specifically, right or right?
[47:46.190 --> 47:47.450]  $225. Brian, we were
[47:47.450 --> 47:49.390]  right. They get more expensive and there's
[47:49.390 --> 47:50.650]  just not a lot of cards in there, man.
[47:51.210 --> 47:53.450]  But here's what we can get. It's a 150
[47:53.450 --> 47:55.430]  card set, including 100 base cards and 50
[47:55.430 --> 47:57.190]  rookies. We can look for these randomly
[47:57.190 --> 47:59.290]  inserted cards. Base, Astro,
[47:59.290 --> 48:01.230]  Groove, Fractal, Galactic,
[48:02.070 --> 48:02.870]  Impact, Cosmic,
[48:03.390 --> 48:05.090]  75th Anniversary, Sunburst,
[48:05.790 --> 48:06.510]  Cubic, Lava,
[48:07.230 --> 48:08.790]  Astro, it just keeps going.
[48:09.130 --> 48:11.050]  That's insane. A lot of opportunity in there.
[48:11.230 --> 48:13.230]  Okay, now here's the thing. Any of these going in the
[48:13.230 --> 48:13.590]  pack sack?
[48:15.050 --> 48:17.170]  Or is this too expensive to live in
[48:17.170 --> 48:18.850]  the pack sack? Yeah.
[48:19.550 --> 48:21.090]  What does that mean? What is
[48:21.090 --> 48:22.810]  yeah? Yeah, it goes in the pack sack. Okay.
[48:23.530 --> 48:24.910]  I'm fucking not happy about that.
[48:24.910 --> 48:25.310]  Okay.
[48:27.830 --> 48:28.630]  That's you.
[48:28.770 --> 48:31.010]  Thanks for keeping me honest, asshole. I'm just making
[48:31.010 --> 48:33.070]  sure. No, I appreciate it. I said
[48:33.070 --> 48:34.850]  thank you. I gave you the opportunity to
[48:34.850 --> 48:36.630]  not do that. Okay, so in this,
[48:37.090 --> 48:38.350]  it just feels good to touch, too.
[48:38.530 --> 48:41.070]  Nice fabric. Yeah, it's great fabric.
[48:41.230 --> 48:41.730]  Whatever it is.
[48:43.070 --> 48:44.790]  Okay, five cards gonna be in here.
[48:44.890 --> 48:46.810]  Oh my god. No purchase
[48:46.810 --> 48:48.250]  necessary. How did I get the cards?
[48:51.050 --> 48:52.710]  I think you got ripped off.
[48:53.230 --> 48:54.270]  Son of a bitch.
[48:55.410 --> 48:55.890]  $250.
[48:56.930 --> 48:58.230]  Some Cracker Jack shit.
[48:59.290 --> 49:00.790]  Alright, let's see. You feeling
[49:00.790 --> 49:02.910]  good? I'm feeling great
[49:02.910 --> 49:04.650]  because the first card is
[49:04.650 --> 49:06.790]  Jason Tatum. Ooh, that has
[49:06.790 --> 49:08.390]  to bode well for you tonight, right?
[49:08.530 --> 49:10.670]  Yeah, that should bode well, right? This is a
[49:10.670 --> 49:12.290]  base card. Yeah.
[49:12.690 --> 49:14.710]  Okay, the base Revolution card. Next is
[49:14.710 --> 49:15.690]  O.G. Ananobi.
[49:17.030 --> 49:18.790]  Then, oh, Jeremy
[49:18.790 --> 49:20.570]  Grant. Perpetual trade rumor,
[49:20.570 --> 49:21.430]  Jeremy Grant.
[49:22.310 --> 49:24.470]  Alright, here we go. This is Aaron
[49:25.090 --> 49:25.910]  Wiggins rookie.
[49:26.270 --> 49:28.370]  This is a Astro
[49:28.370 --> 49:30.370]  Parallel. You can see the stars.
[49:31.510 --> 49:32.710]  That's a rookie. That's very nice.
[49:33.210 --> 49:33.950]  And then,
[49:36.330 --> 49:38.170]  another Aaron Wiggins rookie card.
[49:38.270 --> 49:40.690]  So I got the regular and the Astro Parallel.
[49:40.810 --> 49:41.410]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[49:42.050 --> 49:44.750]  That is very neat. Set those aside.
[49:45.030 --> 49:46.330]  And then we'll set this aside.
[49:47.010 --> 49:48.470]  Put the rest of this doo-doo here.
[49:49.310 --> 49:50.230]  Alright, next pack.
[49:50.310 --> 49:51.990]  Oh, feeling good. I like the way you did that.
[49:52.170 --> 49:54.070]  Feeling good, Aaron. That's good.
[49:55.290 --> 49:56.230]  Good cards so far.
[49:56.370 --> 49:57.970]  And we got our Matrix thing we can start.
[49:57.990 --> 50:00.470]  Yeah, that's pretty exciting. Who looks like they're in the Matrix?
[50:00.690 --> 50:02.250]  Oh, keeping the Celtics theme going.
[50:02.690 --> 50:04.430]  Here we got Derek White.
[50:04.610 --> 50:06.170]  This might be his first Celtics card.
[50:06.270 --> 50:06.970]  I'm excited about that.
[50:12.860 --> 50:13.660]  Throw it on the ground.
[50:14.580 --> 50:15.600]  It wasn't worth anything.
[50:16.160 --> 50:16.880]  Certainly not now.
[50:17.240 --> 50:18.600]  Okay, R.J. Barrett.
[50:20.440 --> 50:22.140]  Then De'Aaron Fox.
[50:22.620 --> 50:24.460]  Ooh, then speaking of...
[50:24.460 --> 50:25.860]  Here's another Astro Parallel.
[50:25.960 --> 50:26.560]  Here's Carmelo.
[50:27.800 --> 50:28.640]  Astro Parallel.
[50:28.820 --> 50:30.480]  Maybe the last time you see him in a Lakers uniform.
[50:30.880 --> 50:33.400]  And then, ooh, Jalen Green.
[50:34.160 --> 50:34.580]  Shockwave.
[50:34.900 --> 50:35.400]  That's pretty cool.
[50:36.200 --> 50:37.600]  Yeah, that's a rookie card.
[50:38.020 --> 50:39.660]  That's pretty cool. That's an insert.
[50:40.160 --> 50:41.420]  Neato. Alright.
[50:42.020 --> 50:42.960]  Keep a couple of those.
[50:44.880 --> 50:46.760]  Just pile on top of De'Aaron Fox.
[50:46.760 --> 50:47.960]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think it's fine.
[50:48.780 --> 50:50.200]  Sacramento Kings, it doesn't matter.
[50:50.720 --> 50:52.580]  No, it's never gonna matter for them.
[50:52.680 --> 50:53.240]  I feel terrible.
[50:53.520 --> 50:54.840]  A lot of talent.
[50:55.340 --> 50:57.620]  Everybody's favorite punchable face, Tyler Hero.
[50:58.480 --> 51:00.560]  Then another, here's the other Wiggins.
[51:00.660 --> 51:01.360]  Andrew Wiggins.
[51:03.120 --> 51:04.240]  Nikola Vucevic.
[51:05.980 --> 51:07.100]  Jonas Valentinus.
[51:07.460 --> 51:08.680]  That's the Astro Parallel.
[51:09.520 --> 51:10.940]  And then...
[51:10.940 --> 51:11.600]  Oh, cool.
[51:12.940 --> 51:14.060]  Rookie Revolution.
[51:14.060 --> 51:16.060]  Rookie Revolution is a Moses Moody rookie card.
[51:16.280 --> 51:16.760]  That's pretty cool.
[51:16.860 --> 51:19.600]  I feel like you're getting a couple of good ones each pack.
[51:19.760 --> 51:21.440]  Yeah, I'm not getting...
[51:22.380 --> 51:23.080]  Big hits.
[51:23.480 --> 51:24.840]  Anywhere near the money I paid.
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.160]  Now that I think about it.
[51:27.940 --> 51:29.080]  Not even close.
[51:29.700 --> 51:29.820]  Nah.
[51:32.220 --> 51:33.220]  What are you gonna do?
[51:34.180 --> 51:35.600]  Carl Anthony Towns.
[51:35.640 --> 51:36.480]  I guess you could stop buying.
[51:37.340 --> 51:38.980]  Bradley Beal, that's one thing I could do.
[51:39.780 --> 51:40.800]  Oh, here's Darius Baisley.
[51:40.800 --> 51:43.080]  These are all obviously base cards.
[51:43.160 --> 51:44.140]  But the base cards are so pretty.
[51:44.680 --> 51:45.540]  Oh, here we go.
[51:45.660 --> 51:47.780]  Here's a Kawhi Leonard Vortex.
[51:48.320 --> 51:50.320]  This is a Fractal.
[51:51.160 --> 51:54.180]  Believe it or not, this is a different parallel than the other one.
[51:54.180 --> 51:54.900]  Can you guys believe that?
[51:54.920 --> 51:55.500]  It's different.
[51:55.660 --> 51:58.080]  I know you're watching this and going, man, I can't believe that.
[51:58.240 --> 52:00.920]  And then this JT Thor base rookie.
[52:00.920 --> 52:01.220]  Great.
[52:03.020 --> 52:04.580]  So that's kind of like the promise here.
[52:04.640 --> 52:05.780]  You got some rookie stuff.
[52:06.300 --> 52:10.780]  You get one parallel and one rookie or insert per pack.
[52:10.780 --> 52:13.860]  I believe this is how this kind of thing typically goes.
[52:15.660 --> 52:16.780]  So you can see like...
[52:16.780 --> 52:18.600]  So the first three cards are typically base cards.
[52:18.800 --> 52:21.060]  Gary Trent Jr. base, Jackson Jr. base.
[52:21.140 --> 52:21.940]  This is the Jr. pack.
[52:22.260 --> 52:23.620]  Only people with the last name Jr.
[52:23.700 --> 52:25.160]  Except for Rudy Gobert who fucked it up.
[52:26.100 --> 52:27.740]  Boy, there's trouble down in Utah.
[52:28.040 --> 52:28.920]  Oh, man.
[52:29.300 --> 52:31.640]  Rudy Gobert refuses to play with Donovan Mitchell again.
[52:31.640 --> 52:33.560]  He's really great. It's great.
[52:34.100 --> 52:36.820]  Then another Laker, Russell Westbrook.
[52:37.040 --> 52:39.400]  This is the groove parallel.
[52:39.400 --> 52:40.560]  The man himself.
[52:41.780 --> 52:43.640]  It's cool. You see him going up for that shot.
[52:43.740 --> 52:44.980]  He's missing. It's pretty exciting.
[52:45.340 --> 52:46.740]  Over and over. It captured it in perpetuity.
[52:47.360 --> 52:48.520]  And then a Trey Mann rookie.
[52:48.900 --> 52:49.720]  That's just the base.
[52:52.000 --> 52:52.600]  They're pretty.
[52:52.780 --> 52:54.560]  If nothing else, they're pretty.
[52:54.740 --> 52:55.480]  They're good looking cards.
[52:57.860 --> 52:58.300]  Cool.
[53:00.320 --> 53:00.760]  Yeah.
[53:00.960 --> 53:02.240]  You feeling good now?
[53:02.260 --> 53:02.680]  I might have.
[53:04.220 --> 53:04.980]  Here we go.
[53:04.980 --> 53:06.580]  Here's Kawhi Leonard.
[53:07.080 --> 53:08.620]  Base card.
[53:08.940 --> 53:10.740]  Clint Capella base card.
[53:11.540 --> 53:12.860]  Harrison Barnes
[53:12.860 --> 53:13.720]  base card.
[53:14.420 --> 53:15.680]  Then here's a
[53:17.260 --> 53:17.940]  numbered
[53:18.800 --> 53:20.100]  Cosmic Parallel.
[53:20.200 --> 53:21.520]  Davion Mitchell rookie.
[53:21.880 --> 53:23.980]  Numbered to 99.
[53:24.540 --> 53:26.780]  You can see that back there at the bottom.
[53:27.300 --> 53:28.660]  This is number...
[53:28.660 --> 53:30.000]  67 of 99.
[53:30.480 --> 53:31.820]  That might be the big hit of the pack.
[53:31.820 --> 53:33.740]  If it's not, it's this.
[53:34.060 --> 53:35.760]  The Evan Mobley Vortex.
[53:36.120 --> 53:36.540]  Oh, cool.
[53:37.340 --> 53:39.820]  That is also a...
[53:43.260 --> 53:44.580]  It's a parallel of some kind.
[53:44.880 --> 53:45.480]  But it doesn't say.
[53:46.360 --> 53:47.940]  Anyway, very cool.
[53:48.440 --> 53:49.080]  Nice one.
[53:50.460 --> 53:51.440]  Didn't win rookie of the year.
[53:52.900 --> 53:54.100]  Definitely going to be a superstar.
[53:54.460 --> 53:55.220]  Is this the last one here?
[53:55.360 --> 53:56.140]  The last pack.
[53:57.400 --> 53:58.940]  We have five minutes left.
[53:59.020 --> 54:01.360]  We can get something weird and go out on top.
[54:01.360 --> 54:02.160]  Yeah, we can do that.
[54:02.440 --> 54:03.400]  Andy Davis.
[54:05.440 --> 54:06.560]  Zion again.
[54:07.860 --> 54:08.960]  You're going to hang on to it.
[54:09.060 --> 54:09.700]  I love Zion.
[54:10.140 --> 54:10.720]  Lugens Dort.
[54:12.660 --> 54:15.640]  Just the strangest NBA name ever.
[54:15.780 --> 54:16.360]  Lugens Dort.
[54:16.440 --> 54:18.360]  Lugens Dort.
[54:18.600 --> 54:19.900]  He's awesome.
[54:20.380 --> 54:21.960]  He's really...
[54:22.780 --> 54:25.080]  Oh, here we go.
[54:25.280 --> 54:26.240]  Man, they're really...
[54:26.240 --> 54:27.540]  All the different parallels.
[54:27.540 --> 54:28.640]  That's a really cool looking card.
[54:30.260 --> 54:31.360]  That's Ty Jones.
[54:31.480 --> 54:33.180]  I think that's the coolest looking card you've gotten.
[54:33.460 --> 54:34.580]  That's really crazy.
[54:34.680 --> 54:36.260]  If he becomes a superstar, it'll be worth something too.
[54:36.760 --> 54:38.220]  And then final rookie card.
[54:38.360 --> 54:39.040]  This is actually not bad.
[54:39.100 --> 54:41.180]  Jonathan Kuminga for the Golden State Warriors.
[54:41.440 --> 54:42.580]  Having a pretty good postseason.
[54:43.680 --> 54:45.960]  So that's that on the big boys.
[54:47.940 --> 54:49.100]  We got five minutes left.
[54:49.220 --> 54:50.760]  Yeah, you got something that...
[54:50.760 --> 54:51.460]  You want to do that?
[54:51.620 --> 54:54.460]  Are you going to look and pull or close your eyes?
[54:54.460 --> 54:56.100]  What if I got the...
[54:56.100 --> 54:57.980]  Yeah, that's why I thought you were looking and pulling.
[54:58.400 --> 54:58.980]  Here we go.
[54:59.480 --> 55:02.220]  This is going to...
[55:02.220 --> 55:04.320]  That looks the most...
[55:04.320 --> 55:05.640]  90's fucked up.
[55:06.500 --> 55:07.800]  This is...
[55:08.460 --> 55:10.880]  Brain straining doodle wonkers.
[55:11.780 --> 55:14.540]  If you're wondering what the 90's looked like,
[55:14.680 --> 55:17.160]  it was that but everything all the time.
[55:17.300 --> 55:17.460]  Yeah.
[55:17.660 --> 55:21.920]  A friend of a friend was stoned and drew that everywhere.
[55:22.020 --> 55:23.560]  Everything everywhere all at once but this.
[55:23.560 --> 55:24.060]  It was that.
[55:24.320 --> 55:25.340]  It's disgusting.
[55:25.780 --> 55:29.720]  Absolutely vile cartoon and then Duckman was on.
[55:35.700 --> 55:36.200]  I...
[55:36.200 --> 55:37.960]  Grunge music and this shit.
[55:39.040 --> 55:40.380]  Yeah, but we got Syphil and Ollie.
[55:41.940 --> 55:42.940]  Sticky situation.
[55:43.340 --> 55:44.880]  These are like little games and shit.
[55:45.540 --> 55:46.640]  No, they got like little dudes.
[55:46.840 --> 55:47.940]  Little dudes in the back.
[55:49.080 --> 55:49.580]  Also...
[55:49.580 --> 55:50.220]  Oh yeah, here we go.
[55:50.380 --> 55:53.440]  Here's a ringer skink.
[55:53.900 --> 55:54.480]  Okay.
[55:55.160 --> 55:57.440]  And then here's foom for fink.
[55:57.660 --> 55:58.680]  These suck.
[55:59.880 --> 56:01.440]  Ring skink.
[56:01.620 --> 56:02.500]  These suck.
[56:02.560 --> 56:03.820]  Stickers are pretty cool.
[56:07.430 --> 56:08.620]  These cards suck.
[56:08.880 --> 56:10.960]  Skink and skink, ring skink.
[56:12.240 --> 56:13.440]  Ringer skink.
[56:13.800 --> 56:14.600]  Ring skink.
[56:14.900 --> 56:15.340]  Skinkening.
[56:15.340 --> 56:15.580]  Skink.
[56:15.820 --> 56:17.380]  We got some tops.
[56:17.540 --> 56:19.780]  20 holiday.
[56:20.620 --> 56:22.220]  We might find something fun.
[56:22.400 --> 56:25.400]  We might get a card with a Christmas sweater.
[56:25.780 --> 56:26.280]  Relic.
[56:26.520 --> 56:29.120]  Maybe a...
[56:29.880 --> 56:30.920]  What do you call it?
[56:31.760 --> 56:32.200]  That thing.
[56:33.300 --> 56:33.940]  Snowflake.
[56:35.700 --> 56:36.380]  Kyle Schwarber.
[56:36.840 --> 56:37.920]  Brian Reynolds.
[56:38.060 --> 56:39.160]  Cody Bellinger.
[56:39.620 --> 56:40.800]  Jake Rogers.
[56:40.800 --> 56:42.180]  Yon Moncada.
[56:42.480 --> 56:43.300]  Dee Gordon.
[56:43.920 --> 56:45.000]  Jack Flaherty.
[56:45.320 --> 56:46.540]  Rick Porcello.
[56:47.480 --> 56:48.500]  Juan Soto.
[56:49.840 --> 56:51.400]  And Kevin Newman.
[56:51.820 --> 56:55.080]  I like Juan Soto because every time he takes a strike, he grabs his dick.
[56:55.380 --> 56:55.860]  A lot.
[56:56.180 --> 56:57.920]  And you just go, I guess it's baseball.
[56:58.780 --> 57:00.440]  No one else does this.
[57:00.540 --> 57:01.840]  It's the Soto Shuffle.
[57:02.000 --> 57:03.920]  I know what he'll be doing afterwards in the parking lot.
[57:04.800 --> 57:05.840]  Backing off.
[57:06.640 --> 57:06.880]  Alright.
[57:06.880 --> 57:08.920]  And then, this is for you, Tops Finest.
[57:09.260 --> 57:10.400]  We're back in the wrestling world.
[57:10.500 --> 57:11.100]  Let's do it.
[57:11.680 --> 57:12.760]  Drew McIntyre on the cover.
[57:12.840 --> 57:14.140]  Let's see if we get anyone good.
[57:14.300 --> 57:16.400]  Can't go wrong with that name.
[57:17.980 --> 57:19.280]  Tegan Knox, rookie.
[57:19.440 --> 57:20.240]  Doesn't work there anymore.
[57:21.480 --> 57:24.080]  This is a numbered parallel.
[57:24.300 --> 57:25.280]  Edge parallel.
[57:27.500 --> 57:27.980]  Numbered...
[57:27.980 --> 57:30.520]  This is number 23 of 150.
[57:31.600 --> 57:33.100]  Then Roderick Strong.
[57:33.440 --> 57:33.940]  That's cool.
[57:33.940 --> 57:34.960]  What is he doing?
[57:35.140 --> 57:36.480]  He's doing the Stronghold.
[57:36.600 --> 57:37.740]  He's not enjoying it.
[57:37.840 --> 57:39.940]  And then Johnny Gargano.
[57:41.340 --> 57:42.800]  What's Johnny Gargano up to today?
[57:43.520 --> 57:44.560]  Streaming on Twitch, probably.
[57:45.180 --> 57:45.720]  That's a big thing.
[57:45.920 --> 57:48.000]  A lot of Stritch Tweemers.
[57:49.160 --> 57:50.400]  We're streaming on Twitch also.
[57:52.440 --> 57:53.980]  What do they do on Twitch?
[57:54.180 --> 57:54.960]  Do they open baseball cards?
[57:55.260 --> 57:56.020]  Yeah, sometimes.
[57:57.600 --> 57:59.080]  What are we opening?
[57:59.280 --> 58:00.260]  This is 91 Tops again.
[58:00.260 --> 58:00.780]  Really?
[58:01.260 --> 58:03.200]  We're ending with 91 Tops?
[58:04.580 --> 58:05.840]  Dan Plezak.
[58:06.140 --> 58:07.100]  Al Jeter.
[58:07.420 --> 58:09.800]  Not to be confused with the other Jeter.
[58:10.820 --> 58:11.620]  Sean Dunstan.
[58:11.940 --> 58:14.460]  One of the hardest-throwing baseball players of all time.
[58:15.500 --> 58:19.560]  Once in my life, I wanted to catch Sean Dunstan's fastest throw.
[58:20.100 --> 58:21.040]  Milt Koehler.
[58:21.980 --> 58:23.180]  Juan Gonzalez.
[58:25.500 --> 58:26.460]  Rance Mullin.
[58:26.960 --> 58:27.700]  What the fuck?
[58:29.940 --> 58:30.660]  Rance Mullinix.
[58:30.920 --> 58:32.000]  That's a great baseball name.
[58:32.000 --> 58:33.200]  He looks like an accountant.
[58:33.300 --> 58:34.340]  His name is Rance.
[58:34.480 --> 58:35.440]  Look at his fucking face.
[58:36.800 --> 58:37.960]  Look at his glasses.
[58:38.140 --> 58:39.220]  You didn't even point out the glasses.
[58:41.600 --> 58:42.940]  This is a slow stroke.
[58:43.940 --> 58:44.920]  You might be done for.
[58:45.120 --> 58:45.920]  I don't know if I'm going to make it.
[58:46.280 --> 58:47.140]  Julio Franco.
[58:49.100 --> 58:49.820]  Ozzy Canseco.
[58:50.840 --> 58:52.280]  Not to be confused with the other Canseco.
[58:52.680 --> 58:54.360]  Although they both were athletics.
[58:55.180 --> 58:55.980]  Jim Presley.
[58:57.440 --> 58:58.240]  Randy Velarde.
[59:01.040 --> 59:01.840]  Mike Aldrete.
[59:02.680 --> 59:03.360]  Matt Williams.
[59:05.140 --> 59:05.940]  Junior Felix.
[59:07.580 --> 59:09.480]  No Zims from the 91s.
[59:09.840 --> 59:10.620]  But we did get an accountant.
[59:10.840 --> 59:11.540]  Yeah, we got an accountant.
[59:12.920 --> 59:14.140]  We should probably wrap up.
[59:14.480 --> 59:15.560]  Yeah, I guess that'll do it.
[59:15.640 --> 59:17.020]  I feel like we got some good stuff.
[59:17.200 --> 59:18.320]  I feel like we got some fun.
[59:18.640 --> 59:21.460]  This was an hour-long break shit.
[59:22.340 --> 59:23.320]  Face break shit.
[59:24.680 --> 59:26.400]  I think we want to do these more frequently.
[59:26.780 --> 59:28.580]  I would ultimately like to do them weekly.
[59:28.700 --> 59:29.020]  Yes.
[59:29.440 --> 59:31.840]  And I think we're really close to being able to do that.
[59:31.940 --> 59:34.900]  And then we'll still do some bigger ones.
[59:34.920 --> 59:36.000]  I think with the whole group.
[59:36.120 --> 59:37.860]  But I think weekly it'll probably be
[59:37.860 --> 59:39.400]  just you, me and you.
[59:40.480 --> 59:41.660]  With Gavin's around.
[59:41.840 --> 59:42.720]  Like that kind of stuff.
[59:42.880 --> 59:43.960]  I think that's the cadence.
[59:44.160 --> 59:46.860]  Just you and I and maybe one other person, but not needed.
[59:47.040 --> 59:48.740]  And then we'll do that three weeks.
[59:48.740 --> 59:50.960]  And then once a month we do a big one.
[59:51.180 --> 59:51.720]  I think that'll be a lot of fun.
[59:51.900 --> 59:52.440]  Time to feed the dog.
[59:53.620 --> 59:56.060]  The time to feed the dog alarm means that
[59:57.200 --> 59:58.340]  we have to go.
