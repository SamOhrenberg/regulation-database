[00:00.000 --> 00:05.100]  Uh, oh, hello. I've just had, um, record pressed, haven't I?
[00:06.340 --> 00:07.400]  You don't know what this is?
[00:07.820 --> 00:08.600]  No, dumbass.
[00:08.660 --> 00:08.860]  Yeah.
[00:08.920 --> 00:09.280]  No.
[00:09.420 --> 00:11.220]  I'm just trying to put across the audience that you don't know what this is.
[00:11.480 --> 00:11.840]  No.
[00:12.000 --> 00:12.220]  Yeah.
[00:12.480 --> 00:13.380]  No, I don't know.
[00:13.560 --> 00:15.460]  First of all, you said you had record pressed.
[00:15.480 --> 00:19.780]  Gavin, this is the first time you've ever intro'd anything for this show.
[00:20.200 --> 00:21.720]  It better be led by you.
[00:23.320 --> 00:24.760]  Nobody knows what you're doing here.
[00:25.240 --> 00:26.800]  I just want to... that's what I was saying.
[00:26.800 --> 00:30.800]  But I noticed that recently, Eric, um, struggled to participate in something.
[00:33.720 --> 00:36.340]  Oh, this is not a three minute bit.
[00:36.780 --> 00:38.240]  Yeah, what are you doing?
[00:38.340 --> 00:40.000]  This is not a three minute bit.
[00:40.200 --> 00:41.940]  I mean, the three minute bit was a lie.
[00:45.380 --> 00:49.980]  Gavin has, uh, for the audience here, Gavin and for Andrew, apparently,
[00:50.380 --> 00:53.360]  Gavin has given Eric a tube of Icy Hot.
[00:53.360 --> 00:56.180]  But this is good. This is... we can finally all do it together.
[00:56.400 --> 00:56.580]  Yeah.
[00:56.580 --> 00:57.720]  This is really fantastic.
[00:58.780 --> 00:59.100]  So...
[00:59.100 --> 00:59.640]  Ice me up.
[00:59.960 --> 01:00.920]  We're going to do it. Let's do it.
[01:01.000 --> 01:01.140]  Yep.
[01:01.760 --> 01:02.900]  Andrew, are you ready to do it?
[01:03.000 --> 01:03.840]  Andrew, you got any Icy Hot at home?
[01:04.020 --> 01:05.760]  Yep. Yep. I'm ready.
[01:06.040 --> 01:08.480]  No. Can we cut this into an episode?
[01:08.740 --> 01:09.920]  I feel like this should be episode content.
[01:10.800 --> 01:11.920]  Was it going to happen in an episode?
[01:12.040 --> 01:14.120]  I can't get Eric to get the damn stuff.
[01:14.160 --> 01:14.560]  That's true.
[01:14.760 --> 01:15.900]  I had to put it in his hand.
[01:16.420 --> 01:18.720]  We'll intro it into the... like, we're recording this week, right?
[01:18.860 --> 01:20.540]  One more episode of F*** Face for the...
[01:20.540 --> 01:22.380]  We're doing two more on Thursday.
[01:22.800 --> 01:24.220]  So the first episode, we'll cut this in.
[01:24.340 --> 01:25.260]  Oh, it's fucking smelly.
[01:25.780 --> 01:26.560]  This is the intro.
[01:26.920 --> 01:28.880]  So get rid of it then, right?
[01:29.040 --> 01:31.360]  Yeah, here's my little dabble being me.
[01:31.760 --> 01:33.060]  Wait, you're going to put it on right now?
[01:33.160 --> 01:34.060]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Slow down.
[01:34.340 --> 01:36.560]  Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.
[01:37.400 --> 01:38.900]  Why are you putting it on right now?
[01:39.880 --> 01:41.440]  Because we're doing it now. What do you mean?
[01:41.680 --> 01:43.720]  I thought you just said we're going to do it in the episode.
[01:43.720 --> 01:46.220]  No, we're going to cut this in.
[01:46.240 --> 01:47.360]  He said we'll cut this in.
[01:47.400 --> 01:50.000]  This is the intro to one of the episodes we're recording on Thursday.
[01:50.820 --> 01:52.960]  How does this... do you understand what's happening?
[01:53.740 --> 01:54.460]  Unfortunately, yeah.
[01:54.460 --> 01:56.240]  So we all put this on.
[01:57.100 --> 01:57.260]  Yeah.
[01:57.420 --> 02:01.000]  But we're recording an episode not using it on Thursday.
[02:01.120 --> 02:01.360]  Yes.
[02:01.400 --> 02:03.460]  No, so we'll start the episode on Thursday.
[02:03.600 --> 02:04.120]  We'll talk about it.
[02:04.280 --> 02:07.320]  And now for a special piece of content, boom, then we hard cut to this.
[02:07.620 --> 02:10.460]  The audience gets this little bit of interaction when we come back to the episode.
[02:10.560 --> 02:13.280]  But why are we doing that when we can just do it for an episode?
[02:13.280 --> 02:15.600]  Because you refuse to do this in any other context.
[02:15.680 --> 02:16.760]  Hey, look, if you want to say...
[02:16.760 --> 02:18.160]  I'm telling you I'll do it. I have it.
[02:18.340 --> 02:19.380]  I'll do it on the episode.
[02:19.620 --> 02:20.820]  I thought that's what we all just said.
[02:20.820 --> 02:22.100]  So this is merely just an intro piece.
[02:22.260 --> 02:22.520]  Yes.
[02:22.620 --> 02:22.820]  Okay.
[02:22.920 --> 02:24.280]  That's what I thought we were doing.
[02:24.460 --> 02:26.940]  And then Geoff was just going to slather it on.
[02:27.040 --> 02:30.440]  So then this is the part where we cut back to the episode and find out if he does it.
[02:30.720 --> 02:34.820]  I'm 100% do it. I have nothing against doing it.
[02:35.280 --> 02:36.240]  Hey, that was a three minute bit.
[02:36.360 --> 02:39.960]  Yeah. It's just that everyone started jumping ahead to something that,
[02:40.140 --> 02:42.180]  I'll be honest, still doesn't make sense to me.
[02:43.000 --> 02:43.320]  Wait, what?
[02:43.520 --> 02:44.860]  Why would we do...
[02:44.860 --> 02:47.000]  Why would we put this on our balls now?
[02:47.280 --> 02:48.020]  Because we're all together.
[02:48.700 --> 02:49.680]  Yeah, because we're all together.
[02:49.860 --> 02:52.220]  Because you refuse to do it in any other context.
[02:52.220 --> 02:55.300]  But he's saying we would have cut away from all the action.
[02:55.520 --> 03:02.700]  Why would you do it and then go to the regular episode to not see the results of putting it on?
[03:03.040 --> 03:04.620]  No, we could go for a while.
[03:04.700 --> 03:06.160]  He lied about it being a three minute thing.
[03:06.560 --> 03:07.180]  This is your fault, Eric.
[03:07.300 --> 03:08.260]  You can't be mad at this.
[03:08.520 --> 03:09.460]  This is on you.
[03:09.680 --> 03:13.800]  Have we as a team of five people ever been less on the same page as we are today?
[03:14.060 --> 03:15.820]  Here's what is positive.
[03:15.920 --> 03:17.680]  This is my understanding of it.
[03:18.420 --> 03:22.200]  Geoff was about to put this on and then we were all going to do it.
[03:22.220 --> 03:22.900]  Right now.
[03:23.300 --> 03:26.940]  And then when you put it on, we were going to...
[03:26.940 --> 03:27.260]  Be miserable.
[03:27.540 --> 03:28.060]  No, no, no.
[03:28.820 --> 03:30.000]  Shut the fuck up.
[03:30.820 --> 03:33.620]  We were going to cut away.
[03:33.820 --> 03:38.020]  We're going to put it on and then cut away to a regular episode.
[03:38.680 --> 03:40.440]  No, I think we'd be miserable for a while.
[03:40.460 --> 03:41.940]  And then we cut back to the old one.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.540]  And then when we record...
[03:43.540 --> 03:45.700]  We could do it to be funny with the regular episode.
[03:45.780 --> 03:46.700]  We could just be doing the episode.
[03:46.780 --> 03:49.560]  Then we go, let's check in and see how our other selves are doing from a couple days ago.
[03:49.560 --> 03:50.460]  Why would we do that?
[03:50.460 --> 03:51.900]  Just do it in the full episode.
[03:52.220 --> 03:53.280]  I'm not crazy.
[03:53.360 --> 03:54.560]  You guys are not.
[03:55.660 --> 03:56.980]  No, it's not that I refuse.
[03:57.220 --> 03:58.780]  I'm legitimately going to throw up.
[04:00.020 --> 04:02.800]  I'm fine with doing it on Thursday in an episode.
[04:04.020 --> 04:05.420]  I have no problem.
[04:05.760 --> 04:07.480]  I don't know what to say to that.
[04:07.540 --> 04:09.420]  Like, why wouldn't we do it in an episode?
[04:09.680 --> 04:12.080]  I am stunned because you make it every time.
[04:13.040 --> 04:14.280]  I haven't refused.
[04:14.500 --> 04:15.420]  I didn't have it.
[04:15.600 --> 04:16.800]  What? You haven't refused?
[04:17.120 --> 04:17.720]  What do you mean?
[04:17.760 --> 04:18.520]  I haven't refused.
[04:18.640 --> 04:19.240]  I didn't have it.
[04:19.280 --> 04:20.540]  I didn't have the means to do it.
[04:20.540 --> 04:22.340]  It's a fucking rare item.
[04:26.080 --> 04:29.600]  I'm going to take it home and then we're going to do it on Thursday.
[04:29.780 --> 04:31.660]  Oh, I forgot it, guys.
[04:31.740 --> 04:32.740]  I left it in my car.
[04:32.860 --> 04:33.920]  I can't leave the house.
[04:34.060 --> 04:34.720]  It's in my car.
[04:34.900 --> 04:35.140]  It's not here.
[04:35.160 --> 04:37.080]  I have a staunch refusal for doing it.
[04:37.180 --> 04:37.840]  I just didn't have it.
[04:37.980 --> 04:42.060]  Yes, based on the fact that you've not done it for four weeks in a row.
[04:42.340 --> 04:45.480]  You didn't have it four weeks ago and three weeks ago.
[04:45.580 --> 04:49.060]  And in the last two recordings, you didn't even bring it up and you didn't have it.
[04:49.060 --> 04:50.780]  Right, because I still didn't have it.
[04:51.020 --> 04:51.700]  With... no.
[04:51.940 --> 04:52.980]  Why wouldn't you get some?
[04:53.180 --> 04:55.540]  But he had it at one point and then didn't have it.
[04:56.120 --> 04:56.880]  No, I never had it.
[04:57.020 --> 04:57.660]  He didn't have it.
[04:57.880 --> 04:58.700]  No, I never had it.
[04:58.940 --> 05:00.460]  Well, you have it. It's in your fucking hand now.
[05:00.480 --> 05:00.920]  Yeah, I have it now.
[05:01.020 --> 05:04.580]  You said we will all do this next week and that was four weeks ago.
[05:04.700 --> 05:06.160]  Yeah, so we're all going to do it on Thursday.
[05:06.380 --> 05:07.940]  So is this the preview for the next episode?
[05:08.060 --> 05:08.340]  Yes.
[05:08.500 --> 05:08.720]  Okay.
[05:08.960 --> 05:10.120]  All right, so just put that out on social.
[05:10.680 --> 05:13.840]  Hey, in the next episode, we're all doing this on our balls.
[05:14.420 --> 05:18.040]  And Geoff almost did it right now and was going, I'll be honest,
[05:18.040 --> 05:20.160]  was going to be the only one who did it.
[05:20.520 --> 05:22.320]  No, we were all going to do it.
[05:23.720 --> 05:26.400]  Because I was bringing up how it didn't make any sense,
[05:26.460 --> 05:28.300]  but he was already going for it.
[05:28.600 --> 05:29.220]  That's what I'm saying.
[05:29.440 --> 05:31.000]  In the context that you've been avoiding this for weeks.
[05:31.000 --> 05:31.880]  Because I'm up for a good time.
[05:32.620 --> 05:33.700]  I'm always up for a good time.
[05:33.920 --> 05:35.400]  You're staring at me while you're yelling at Andrew.
[05:35.540 --> 05:37.140]  Yeah, I still got it in my hand.
[05:37.220 --> 05:38.440]  I'm still ready to go if you guys want to go.
[05:38.440 --> 05:39.220]  You don't have to go.
[05:39.360 --> 05:39.840]  I just don't.
[05:39.920 --> 05:41.380]  Why would we put it on and then cut away?
[05:41.400 --> 05:42.680]  Oh, it's fucking suck is what it would do.
[05:42.700 --> 05:43.260]  Doesn't make any sense.
[05:43.300 --> 05:43.840]  Yeah, it's funny.
[05:44.480 --> 05:44.740]  All right.
[05:44.760 --> 05:45.260]  That'd be funny.
[05:45.340 --> 05:45.980]  All right, tune in.
[05:45.980 --> 05:46.960]  All right, see you on the episode.
[05:47.080 --> 05:47.680]  Next episode.
[05:48.580 --> 05:49.220]  I have it now.
