[00:07.520 --> 00:09.920]  Proudly going their own way, but never going alone.
[00:10.620 --> 00:12.700]  This is the spirit inside Buffalo Trace Bourbon.
[00:13.160 --> 00:16.820]  Made at Buffalo Trace Distillery, the world's most award-winning distillery.
[00:17.600 --> 00:20.420]  Buffalo Trace is always perfectly untamed.

[00:28.400 --> 00:32.800]  Hello and welcome to another episode.
[00:33.520 --> 00:35.180]  Another, another, another.
[00:35.680 --> 00:38.840]  I think another is right. Another. Another episode.
[00:39.300 --> 00:41.560]  Not an episode of Fuckface.
[00:42.020 --> 00:43.540]  We recorded one.
[00:44.400 --> 00:45.860]  Texas got snow on it.
[00:45.920 --> 00:48.940]  Apparently it's mayhem. Nobody has power. Nothing works.
[00:49.160 --> 00:50.780]  The episode was unable to be edited.
[00:51.240 --> 00:56.340]  So I am here today to just let you know that the the episode will come.
[00:56.860 --> 00:58.580]  It's not going to be out today, sadly.
[00:58.980 --> 01:01.440]  But I do have power since I do not live in Texas.
[01:02.480 --> 01:04.080]  So I figured I should record something.
[01:04.160 --> 01:05.580]  So we at least have something here.
[01:06.560 --> 01:10.060]  And I thought a lot about, like, where do I want to go with this?
[01:10.120 --> 01:13.060]  Because I want to provide some content as well as an update.
[01:14.700 --> 01:20.540]  And I thought I have one Fuckface story that I haven't shared.
[01:21.320 --> 01:22.380]  Nobody knows this.
[01:23.580 --> 01:28.420]  It's really it's it's almost like it's easier to say in this format
[01:28.420 --> 01:32.660]  because I don't know what it would be like to tell Geoff and Gavin this directly.
[01:32.960 --> 01:34.160]  That'd be really odd.
[01:36.900 --> 01:39.340]  But Andrew Panton isn't my real name.
[01:40.320 --> 01:41.780]  Andrew Panton is a made up name.
[01:42.640 --> 01:45.080]  I used to. So I was a Rooster Teeth fan.
[01:45.420 --> 01:49.820]  I was a huge fan when I was like 13, maybe, before I met anybody.
[01:50.380 --> 01:54.200]  And my old gamertag used to be AdSec.
[01:54.680 --> 02:00.020]  And I built this really embarrassing map in Halo 3 and Forge.
[02:00.420 --> 02:04.520]  And it was just like everybody's names with gravity hammers and spawn points.
[02:04.660 --> 02:09.660]  It was I'm cringing, thinking about it and talking about it in this moment.
[02:09.780 --> 02:10.840]  And it was just so embarrassing.
[02:11.180 --> 02:17.520]  And then just through happenstance, I met Geoff and people and Gavin.
[02:17.520 --> 02:22.900]  So then I freaked out because this map, I couldn't figure out how to remove it from me.
[02:22.960 --> 02:25.340]  And it said it was created by my gamertag.
[02:25.900 --> 02:30.560]  So I panicked and I changed my gamertag to Andrew Panton.
[02:31.480 --> 02:33.380]  Andrew is the name of one of my uncles.
[02:34.320 --> 02:38.540]  And Panton is the last name of somebody I went to school with.
[02:38.760 --> 02:39.760]  I was in like grade 5.
[02:44.280 --> 02:46.460]  My real name is Raymond Sommaire.
[02:47.520 --> 02:58.760]  And I know that's fucking, this is a weird thing, but I like, I didn't, I didn't expect to become, you know, involved in the community to the extent I was or become friends with anyone.
[03:00.200 --> 03:06.140]  So I've been stuck as Andrew Panton for 13 years.
[03:09.560 --> 03:11.840]  Anyway, I don't really know what to say beyond that.
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.500]  But you can find me at Raymond Sommaire on Twitter.
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.400]  I have a Twitter account. There was a time where I kind of stepped away from doing any Rooster Teeth stuff and I made an account in around 2014.
[03:24.520 --> 03:26.800]  But then I came back and I never really used it.
[03:26.960 --> 03:29.220]  So I think, I think I'll probably tweet.
[03:29.460 --> 03:33.580]  So if you check Raymond Sommaire on Twitter, there's probably going to be a tweet there now.
[03:36.100 --> 03:37.980]  Anyway, sorry the episode couldn't come out.
[03:38.580 --> 03:40.040]  Have a fantastic day.
[03:40.040 --> 03:44.800]  And I'm sure it'll be out relatively soon. I don't know, just depends when power comes back.
[03:45.720 --> 03:47.740]  Texas snow, it's a nightmare.
[03:48.660 --> 03:49.640]  Thank you for listening.
[03:50.440 --> 03:53.080]  And enjoy whenever the episode comes out, hopefully soon.
[03:53.460 --> 03:53.700]  Goodbye.
