[00:10.280 --> 00:11.010]  Geoff, go!
[00:11.470 --> 00:16.930]  Hello and welcome to Sloppy Joe's Bingo Live on a Friday night.
[00:17.210 --> 00:20.310]  This is F*** Face and you are here...
[00:20.310 --> 00:24.330]  Wait, hang on. We have a soundboard. Do the name again.
[00:24.690 --> 00:28.210]  Oh, sorry. This is F*** Face. Thank you.
[00:28.990 --> 00:30.470]  We don't have a delay though.
[00:30.710 --> 00:32.370]  What if it doesn't cut the mic?
[00:32.810 --> 00:35.950]  For the next hour, we are... Do you want to do it again?
[00:37.210 --> 00:38.110]  Do what again?
[00:38.590 --> 00:39.870]  The F*** Face part.
[00:39.970 --> 00:49.350]  Alright, so for the next hour we're going to play a very special game that my fiancÃ© and I invented over the last four months.
[00:50.030 --> 00:52.450]  What we're going to do is we're going to watch this live stream.
[00:52.570 --> 00:57.210]  This is Duval Street in Key West, Florida. We are outside of a bar called Sloppy Joe's.
[00:57.530 --> 01:00.250]  They purport to have invented the Sloppy Joe.
[01:00.530 --> 01:03.290]  Rich history in Sloppy Joe's. I recommend you Wikipedia it sometimes.
[01:03.690 --> 01:06.790]  What we're going to do is we're going to recommend that you play with us.
[01:06.790 --> 01:12.690]  If you look in the description, there's a link to a bingo generator where you can generate your own bingo board.
[01:12.950 --> 01:20.970]  There's going to be some weird prompts like selfie, separated at a crosswalk, hoofing it, cowboy hat, guy on guy's scooter.
[01:21.290 --> 01:24.450]  What you're going to do is you're going to watch along with us and we're all going to play bingo.
[01:24.630 --> 01:29.990]  First person to get the bingo wins a cake of their choice within F*** Face.
[01:30.010 --> 01:32.890]  What is this? What happened? It's a cake bet?
[01:32.890 --> 01:37.930]  Yeah, I was arguing with Geoff about bingoing and I'm going to f***ing bingo the f*** out of this game.
[01:38.010 --> 01:42.150]  So I put a cake on the line. I figured we'd all have a cake on the line. Whoever gets the first bingo gets a cake.
[01:42.410 --> 01:46.570]  But I was excluded from the cake bet and Geoff told me that the loser has to have their finger cut off.
[01:47.270 --> 01:48.950]  Well, I was trying to make a side bet with you.
[01:49.390 --> 01:49.710]  Yeah.
[01:50.810 --> 01:53.030]  Andrew and I had a straight up cake for cake bet.
[01:53.030 --> 02:02.630]  But what if we just do it where F*** Face, bleep that, the winner gets a cake of their choice bought by F*** Face.
[02:03.490 --> 02:09.130]  I personally would like Fudgy the Whale and I know Andrew wants a deep and delicious or something.
[02:09.490 --> 02:10.910]  Can we send Stuart out to get it?
[02:11.650 --> 02:11.930]  No!
[02:12.390 --> 02:15.990]  No, we want it to return. Gavin, you want a fuzzy caterpillar or whatever?
[02:16.950 --> 02:19.430]  Well, let's not get into future content that's not come out yet.
[02:19.430 --> 02:25.850]  Anyway, if you're in the audience, I hope you've clicked on the description and you've gone and generated your own bingo card.
[02:25.990 --> 02:27.410]  I will explain them as we go.
[02:27.870 --> 02:32.990]  Just real quick, sorry, the bingo card, Goovicon is the one who generated this site.
[02:33.130 --> 02:35.810]  He has created the official F*** Face bingo card for us tonight.
[02:36.090 --> 02:37.210]  Thanks so much for making that.
[02:37.590 --> 02:39.750]  Awesome. Awesome, awesome, awesome work.
[02:40.010 --> 02:43.270]  Thank you so much, Goovicon. We really appreciate it.
[02:44.090 --> 02:48.570]  Anyway, if you are unfamiliar with Sloppy Joe's Bingo, we have released one other video.
[02:49.150 --> 02:52.210]  You'll figure it out as we play along and we'll explain stuff as we go.
[02:52.330 --> 02:56.690]  If everybody has their bingo cards generated, I'll start the countdown.
[02:56.930 --> 02:57.530]  Are you guys all good?
[02:57.870 --> 02:58.330]  I'm ready.
[02:58.550 --> 02:59.450]  Okay, ready.
[02:59.630 --> 03:05.930]  Alright, we're gonna go 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and go.
[03:06.090 --> 03:07.290]  Sloppy Joe's Bingo in action.
[03:07.530 --> 03:08.250]  Oh, man.
[03:08.750 --> 03:12.910]  So I have some easy stuff. I got like selfie, I got camera shy, that's easy.
[03:13.250 --> 03:13.430]  Yeah.
[03:14.190 --> 03:17.650]  Cowboy hat, jeans and flip flops. This should all be pretty simple stuff.
[03:17.650 --> 03:19.270]  What's dead parahead again?
[03:20.010 --> 03:27.670]  So a dead parahead is a play on words, but a parahead is a dude who's really into Jimmy Buffet and that Margaritaville lifestyle.
[03:27.990 --> 03:33.170]  What happens in Key West specifically is a lot of dudes will cash in early and go to retire there.
[03:33.210 --> 03:39.370]  And as they do, they run out of money and they get staph infections and they go in and out of hospitals and they look kind of like zombies.
[03:39.850 --> 03:45.130]  And those are what we call dead paraheads. You'll see them walking around. You'll know them.
[03:45.830 --> 03:51.810]  They're like half homeless and wearing a, yeah, definitely an old Margaritaville t-shirt.
[03:52.370 --> 03:52.770]  Hmm.
[03:53.330 --> 03:54.350]  Oh, I've got mullet again.
[03:54.610 --> 03:55.590]  Man, where's jeans and flip flops?
[03:55.590 --> 03:55.850]  Oh, you got mullet again?
[03:55.910 --> 03:58.090]  I've seen a lot of shorts. Shorts and flip flops.
[03:58.090 --> 04:00.430]  I'm looking for a chug. I'm looking for a twerk.
[04:00.690 --> 04:04.610]  I'm going to start looking for easy ones. I'm going to start looking for dumb hats. That's very easy.
[04:04.950 --> 04:10.630]  I mean, the last time we did this and put it up, it was just people going, how come they didn't see the one at four minutes, 35 seconds?
[04:10.890 --> 04:11.010]  I know.
[04:11.010 --> 04:13.510]  And it's like, you're watching so much.
[04:13.510 --> 04:18.250]  I also haven't seen anything for the last two minutes. That guy's yawning. Do we have yawning on the board?
[04:19.550 --> 04:20.150]  I don't have it.
[04:20.390 --> 04:21.730]  There was a crotch grab before we started.
[04:22.590 --> 04:24.750]  Oh, there was definitely a crotch grab before we started.
[04:25.250 --> 04:28.530]  I played a little bit earlier. I saw Bachelorette Party already. I saw a bunch of stuff.
[04:28.830 --> 04:29.470]  Dang, man.
[04:32.370 --> 04:36.130]  So this is like, this is a bar that Ernest Hemingway went to or something?
[04:36.930 --> 04:42.150]  Well, yes. So it was originally in... see, if you get me explaining shit, I won't be able to focus.
[04:42.990 --> 04:44.030]  You're putting me at a disadvantage.
[04:44.650 --> 04:49.030]  It was originally a bar in Cuba, and then they moved to Key West.
[04:49.030 --> 04:51.070]  Oh, is that a crossover? Oh, no, never mind.
[04:51.230 --> 04:53.430]  If he gets in, all right, now that's a pickup.
[04:53.650 --> 04:54.350]  Pickup drop off.
[04:54.670 --> 04:56.530]  Oh, I got that. I got that. Put it on the board.
[04:56.650 --> 04:57.230]  I don't have that one.
[04:57.410 --> 04:58.370]  I don't have that one.
[04:58.430 --> 04:59.530]  I'm trying to see if I have it.
[05:01.110 --> 05:03.950]  I think luxury car is going to be debatable.
[05:05.190 --> 05:07.590]  I have luxury car, and we're going to have to know.
[05:07.930 --> 05:09.250]  Look at the size of that truck.
[05:10.190 --> 05:11.110]  That's a Honka.
[05:11.450 --> 05:12.270]  That's a big truck.
[05:12.470 --> 05:13.970]  Is that an F950?
[05:16.310 --> 05:20.910]  Oh, chugging over there.
[05:21.010 --> 05:21.590]  I think...
[05:21.590 --> 05:22.910]  Oh, yeah, there's definitely...
[05:22.910 --> 05:23.090]  Don't chug!
[05:23.390 --> 05:23.950]  Don't chug!
[05:24.650 --> 05:25.150]  Oh, I got it.
[05:25.570 --> 05:26.130]  Put it on the board.
[05:26.410 --> 05:26.970]  I don't have anything here.
[05:26.970 --> 05:27.910]  Oh, that lady clapping.
[05:28.310 --> 05:30.410]  Oh, is that a dance? Is that technically dancing?
[05:30.570 --> 05:32.150]  I don't know what I'd call that.
[05:32.150 --> 05:34.350]  She's just clapping, having fun.
[05:34.950 --> 05:37.270]  Oh, those dudes are hugging.
[05:37.430 --> 05:38.970]  That was almost a hug. Was that a hug?
[05:39.230 --> 05:39.630]  No.
[05:39.970 --> 05:41.550]  That was a hand on the back.
[05:41.730 --> 05:44.050]  I guess a hug is when, like, nipples touch nipples.
[05:44.430 --> 05:44.670]  Okay.
[05:45.670 --> 05:46.950]  Oh, those ladies are hugging!
[05:47.170 --> 05:48.270]  Those ladies just hugged. That counts.
[05:48.470 --> 05:49.790]  Their nippers were all over each other.
[05:52.690 --> 05:53.730]  I'm on the board.
[05:54.170 --> 05:55.750]  Oh, I don't have that. Damn it.
[05:55.870 --> 05:56.330]  I don't either.
[05:57.350 --> 05:59.030]  That's a definite hug.
[05:59.030 --> 06:05.650]  The thing that kills me is Crosswalk Coward, because I feel like we should see it so much, and you don't see it hardly ever.
[06:05.790 --> 06:07.030]  It goes through cycles, man.
[06:07.770 --> 06:08.790]  I still haven't seen a wheelchair.
[06:09.250 --> 06:12.050]  I was about to say, I used to see wheelchair all the time. I haven't seen any in a while.
[06:12.530 --> 06:14.170]  Oh, is this a dumb hat? No.
[06:14.450 --> 06:16.770]  That guy is a dead parrot head.
[06:17.050 --> 06:17.730]  Oh, shit!
[06:18.150 --> 06:19.670]  I would definitely say dead parrot head on the L.A. hat.
[06:19.670 --> 06:25.350]  That guy had shoes that had toes in them and a long beard, and he was way too tan.
[06:25.730 --> 06:27.590]  Ooh, I got two in a row. Here we go.
[06:27.590 --> 06:29.910]  Dang, come on. I got nothing so far.
[06:30.270 --> 06:32.670]  I got three. I got three on my card. I told you.
[06:33.550 --> 06:35.050]  Keep an eye out for Ghost Tour.
[06:35.590 --> 06:38.250]  I got American flag clothes. Anybody seen the American flag clothes?
[06:38.270 --> 06:39.050]  No, but let me know.
[06:39.490 --> 06:40.330]  Oh, no.
[06:40.630 --> 06:41.390]  No, that's Beatles.
[06:41.610 --> 06:43.570]  No, you thought it was the American flag, but it's Beatles.
[06:45.490 --> 06:47.450]  I don't think I could have been more wrong.
[06:47.690 --> 06:50.750]  I don't know if there's a further from American flag than the Beatles.
[06:51.250 --> 06:53.110]  Oh, Crosswalk Coward! It was a stutter.
[06:53.390 --> 06:54.770]  No, that counted.
[06:54.990 --> 06:56.210]  You think that's a coward?
[06:56.210 --> 06:58.110]  No, because he went.
[06:58.290 --> 07:00.030]  He went. You're right. He made it.
[07:00.250 --> 07:01.110]  Oh, matching outfits.
[07:01.710 --> 07:02.130]  Oh, that bike.
[07:02.470 --> 07:03.790]  No, those are just guys on bikes.
[07:04.130 --> 07:05.810]  Is that a tricycle?
[07:05.970 --> 07:06.150]  Yeah.
[07:06.890 --> 07:09.190]  I am cleaning up.
[07:10.510 --> 07:12.290]  Is that an electric car, Geoff?
[07:13.750 --> 07:14.770]  No, that's not.
[07:14.770 --> 07:15.790]  What? Come on.
[07:16.290 --> 07:16.830]  That's the height of luxury.
[07:16.830 --> 07:18.050]  Is that like a Dodge Charger?
[07:18.330 --> 07:18.510]  No.
[07:19.370 --> 07:20.670]  Dressed up like a wave.
[07:22.110 --> 07:23.070]  Dressed up like a wave.
[07:23.070 --> 07:27.730]  So people know. Oh, hang on. Come on. Crosswalk Coward.
[07:27.730 --> 07:29.690]  Is that matching outfits crossing the road there?
[07:30.010 --> 07:30.390]  No.
[07:30.610 --> 07:31.670]  Well, maybe.
[07:32.290 --> 07:32.890]  No.
[07:33.290 --> 07:34.650]  No, it's close.
[07:34.690 --> 07:35.510]  It's very close.
[07:35.790 --> 07:41.430]  So we worked. Myself and Geoff got the full list together and gave it to Goovicon.
[07:41.710 --> 07:46.930]  So now this bingo card that you're getting is the full on bingo card.
[07:47.410 --> 07:48.030]  Man, that guy.
[07:49.010 --> 07:51.050]  That guy almost got hit by that.
[07:51.050 --> 07:54.770]  But that was crosswalk no fear.
[07:55.170 --> 07:59.210]  Yeah, but if you guys have almost got hit by a car, you can count that as it.
[08:00.270 --> 08:02.270]  He just held up his pants.
[08:02.850 --> 08:04.170]  There's really something, man.
[08:04.810 --> 08:07.630]  That's a man who's crossed that street 160 times.
[08:08.670 --> 08:10.350]  Oh, dude, that guy guts.
[08:10.510 --> 08:11.250]  Just going.
[08:12.110 --> 08:13.150]  Didn't give a fuck.
[08:13.670 --> 08:15.170]  So you can drink on the street here, huh?
[08:15.550 --> 08:17.070]  Yeah, yeah. There's an open container.
[08:17.070 --> 08:18.830]  It is amazing to me.
[08:18.950 --> 08:22.930]  I've been watching this for like four months that I have never seen somebody get plowed into on a bicycle.
[08:22.970 --> 08:26.250]  It almost happens constantly.
[08:27.230 --> 08:28.650]  I need double fisting.
[08:28.830 --> 08:29.350]  I need.
[08:30.630 --> 08:31.310]  Oh, man.
[08:32.290 --> 08:34.490]  I need that couple to come back with the crotch grab.
[08:34.510 --> 08:35.170]  Yeah, seriously.
[08:35.610 --> 08:37.230]  Give me also give me a beach goth.
[08:37.930 --> 08:39.110]  Ooh, beach goth is a good one.
[08:39.290 --> 08:40.290]  I need a meemaw.
[08:40.450 --> 08:41.270]  I need a go-kart.
[08:41.550 --> 08:42.550]  I definitely need a meemaw.
[08:42.930 --> 08:44.650]  I need bandage dude and nighttime shades.
[08:44.770 --> 08:45.790]  Oh, look at those shorts.
[08:45.790 --> 08:48.010]  Oh, those are some shorts, dude.
[08:48.510 --> 08:50.130]  Does anybody have offensive T-shirt?
[08:50.390 --> 08:50.750]  I do.
[08:51.250 --> 08:52.870]  I need it in my currently life.
[08:53.510 --> 08:55.530]  Geoff, is that a luxury car?
[08:57.110 --> 08:58.430]  No, what are you talking about?
[08:58.750 --> 08:59.110]  Come on.
[08:59.470 --> 09:00.690]  That's a three series.
[09:01.130 --> 09:02.050]  Is that a dumb hat?
[09:02.130 --> 09:03.270]  You know what, Eric?
[09:03.530 --> 09:06.690]  Yes, that is a dumb hat and I'll count the BMW.
[09:07.370 --> 09:09.810]  Yeah, luxury car, baby. I'm on the board.
[09:10.710 --> 09:11.250]  Are you serious?
[09:12.090 --> 09:14.290]  Well, yeah, if I don't count his BMW, I can't count mine.
[09:16.210 --> 09:17.650]  I mean, I've got it too.
[09:17.710 --> 09:18.150]  I'll take it.
[09:18.350 --> 09:19.550]  All right.
[09:19.950 --> 09:20.710]  God, that hat.
[09:22.210 --> 09:23.890]  I'm so excited to get a dumb hat.
[09:24.170 --> 09:25.550]  It's a nice spot on my board.
[09:25.630 --> 09:26.290]  That is a good one.
[09:26.530 --> 09:30.610]  He looks like the almost Hank Hill character in Beavis and Butthead.
[09:30.750 --> 09:31.750]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[09:32.250 --> 09:32.570]  Oh, yeah.
[09:32.810 --> 09:33.590]  Yeah, big time.
[09:35.170 --> 09:36.570]  That's a three-way cab.
[09:37.050 --> 09:38.770]  It's almost slop o'clock, right?
[09:39.630 --> 09:41.510]  Yeah, it is.
[09:41.710 --> 09:54.530]  If you're not familiar, if you're not intimately familiar with sloppy Joe Bingo theory in the audience here, it has been determined that 1115 p.m. Eastern time is slop o'clock.
[09:55.050 --> 10:03.190]  That is when the clock strikes slop and people go from getting drunk and partying to definitely drunk and partying.
[10:03.190 --> 10:07.310]  And that's when things get really intense, really fast.
[10:07.490 --> 10:08.750]  And then they taper off very quickly.
[10:08.910 --> 10:10.090]  So it's like highs and lows.
[10:10.250 --> 10:11.750]  Slow the fuck down, guy.
[10:13.850 --> 10:14.370]  Jesus.
[10:15.530 --> 10:16.870]  They got places to be, baby.
[10:16.990 --> 10:17.730]  People walking around.
[10:18.010 --> 10:20.450]  Wow, that is... that's an outfit.
[10:21.190 --> 10:21.690]  Whoa.
[10:21.830 --> 10:22.310]  Whoa.
[10:22.690 --> 10:23.210]  Wow.
[10:24.110 --> 10:25.010]  That's great.
[10:25.450 --> 10:26.610]  My son wears that.
[10:28.730 --> 10:29.970]  Is this a onesie?
[10:30.230 --> 10:30.490]  Yeah.
[10:33.190 --> 10:34.250]  Still after a mullet?
[10:34.830 --> 10:35.130]  Mm-hmm.
[10:35.250 --> 10:35.610]  Yeah.
[10:36.090 --> 10:37.470]  Still after someone in bandages?
[10:37.890 --> 10:39.250]  Oh, I get camera shy.
[10:39.730 --> 10:40.590]  Yeah, me too.
[10:40.810 --> 10:41.210]  Oh, camera shy.
[10:41.230 --> 10:42.390]  Could go for dancing.
[10:42.490 --> 10:43.890]  I need dancing and puking.
[10:44.250 --> 10:45.490]  Would love to see hoofin' it.
[10:45.790 --> 10:46.710]  Somebody hoofin' it.
[10:46.990 --> 10:47.990]  Suckin' on a chili dog.
[10:48.150 --> 10:52.250]  It's a little early, I guess, for people to be eatin' chili dogs.
[10:52.390 --> 10:56.430]  So I have dropped something, but I also have dropped spilled food and drink.
[10:56.570 --> 10:58.510]  And so what I'm hoping is that I get a two-yard double play.
[10:58.510 --> 11:03.150]  Yeah, that's something that we should also explain to the audience.
[11:03.250 --> 11:07.050]  It is possible sometimes a person can be three or four things.
[11:07.410 --> 11:09.250]  It's very rare, but it's fuckin' awesome.
[11:09.350 --> 11:10.910]  It's almost like a golden snitch.
[11:12.230 --> 11:13.310]  Game ends instantly.
[11:14.250 --> 11:14.370]  Yeah.
[11:16.790 --> 11:17.670]  That's clo...
[11:17.670 --> 11:19.130]  Nah, that's not formal wear.
[11:19.330 --> 11:20.490]  Is that matching outfit?
[11:20.890 --> 11:22.170]  No, that's just some guys.
[11:22.270 --> 11:23.670]  She's still waving to those dudes.
[11:24.010 --> 11:25.410]  He's not waving back!
[11:26.310 --> 11:27.030]  They're not interested.
[11:27.510 --> 11:28.430]  She's waving him over.
[11:29.150 --> 11:29.370]  That's rude.
[11:31.270 --> 11:32.590]  Hey, wait, hey, hey!
[11:33.350 --> 11:35.990]  Is that someone... where is it?
[11:36.030 --> 11:37.790]  Someone yelling, come on, or hey?
[11:37.950 --> 11:38.850]  Oh, that's how you wait up.
[11:38.970 --> 11:39.970]  Yeah, that counts as a wait up.
[11:40.170 --> 11:41.030]  Okay, alright, cool, cool.
[11:41.270 --> 11:43.390]  Where is that one? I have it. Where is it?
[11:43.530 --> 11:45.330]  Yeah, that counts as a wait up. Wink.
[11:47.270 --> 11:49.070]  Someone yells wait up, boom, on the board, boom.
[11:49.470 --> 11:49.690]  Bam.
[11:49.990 --> 11:52.170]  Come on, jeans and flip-flops, let's go.
[11:52.170 --> 11:53.510]  Somebody acknowledge the camera.
[11:53.810 --> 11:54.890]  Oh, she's...
[11:54.890 --> 11:57.010]  They're having fun.
[11:57.990 --> 11:58.390]  She's...
[11:58.390 --> 11:59.090]  She thought about it.
[11:59.230 --> 11:59.650]  Figuring it out.
[11:59.990 --> 12:01.490]  Did you say jeans and flip-flop?
[12:01.650 --> 12:03.470]  No, no, no, I'm looking for it.
[12:03.550 --> 12:06.330]  I can't believe I haven't seen it.
[12:07.570 --> 12:09.150]  I can't believe nobody's acknowledging the camera.
[12:11.270 --> 12:12.270]  Everyone's just cool with it.
[12:13.650 --> 12:15.590]  I would need to see some bandage guys right now.
[12:16.110 --> 12:20.610]  I've been thinking about adding ground effects to the list, because I'm starting to see a lot of cars with ground effects.
[12:20.610 --> 12:22.430]  Oh, cars with ground effects, I see.
[12:22.730 --> 12:24.650]  I thought you meant like something happens to the ground.
[12:25.530 --> 12:26.610]  It's an earthquake.
[12:29.770 --> 12:31.270]  Jeans and flip-flops, right side.
[12:31.810 --> 12:33.510]  Right side, that woman, jeans and flip-flops.
[12:33.810 --> 12:34.410]  Is that jeans?
[12:34.610 --> 12:35.790]  Is she in jeans or a dress?
[12:35.970 --> 12:36.010]  Where?
[12:36.350 --> 12:37.930]  I think it's those white-ass pants.
[12:38.530 --> 12:39.770]  Guy in a blue-and-white dress.
[12:40.330 --> 12:41.850]  No, dude, those aren't jeans.
[12:42.090 --> 12:43.970]  No, those are just weird-ass pants.
[12:44.350 --> 12:44.930]  Those are cotton.
[12:47.150 --> 12:47.950]  Oh, goddammit.
[12:48.410 --> 12:48.890]  No, no, no.
[12:48.890 --> 12:49.410]  Those are shoes, Doug.
[12:49.890 --> 12:50.850]  Those are shoes, buddy.
[12:51.650 --> 12:52.630]  Oh, has he got two drinks?
[12:52.730 --> 12:53.190]  Oh, just one.
[12:54.110 --> 12:55.350]  It's a pantsuit.
[12:56.270 --> 12:58.090]  I don't have pantsuit on the list.
[12:58.210 --> 12:59.850]  Oh, what's on that shirt? That could be offensive.
[12:59.890 --> 13:01.550]  That feels like it could be an offensive shirt.
[13:01.790 --> 13:02.890]  It's a picture of a rooster.
[13:04.130 --> 13:06.370]  And if it's got a picture of a rooster, it's offensive.
[13:08.510 --> 13:08.890]  Wink.
[13:09.070 --> 13:12.250]  Los Angeles, California, that's probably offensive if you're in a red state.
[13:12.910 --> 13:14.430]  That's offensive to me. I hate it.
[13:14.630 --> 13:15.890]  Ooh, a gator's hat. That's offensive.
[13:17.170 --> 13:18.210]  Yeah, that's true.
[13:20.310 --> 13:22.610]  These guys have matching necklaces. Is that a matching outfit?
[13:22.610 --> 13:23.230]  No.
[13:23.590 --> 13:26.050]  What a reach.
[13:26.530 --> 13:27.510]  I'm reaching here.
[13:27.790 --> 13:29.330]  I feel like we already had like...
[13:29.330 --> 13:29.750]  Is that a kid?
[13:29.830 --> 13:30.330]  I feel like...
[13:30.330 --> 13:30.770]  Is that a kid?
[13:31.010 --> 13:33.270]  I can't tell. I don't know if it's a kid or not.
[13:33.350 --> 13:34.210]  Oh, it's a camera!
[13:34.550 --> 13:35.750]  That's a Meemaw though.
[13:37.310 --> 13:38.830]  Acknowledge camera and Meemaw.
[13:39.130 --> 13:40.970]  I think that was a kid.
[13:41.610 --> 13:42.950]  Where did you see Meemaw?
[13:43.830 --> 13:45.990]  She was the grandmother of the kid.
[13:46.090 --> 13:47.990]  She's still angling down. She's very old.
[13:48.190 --> 13:49.370]  Alright, Meemaw, I got it. Boom, baby.
[13:50.070 --> 13:51.930]  What was the other one? Acknowledge camera?
[13:52.750 --> 13:54.390]  Meemaw, acknowledge camera, and kid.
[13:56.390 --> 13:57.330]  God damn it.
[13:57.390 --> 13:59.990]  Was that almost got in the wrong car? Or were they just trying to flag something down?
[14:00.430 --> 14:02.110]  No, I think she was just trying to...
[14:02.110 --> 14:05.150]  Man, there's so much going on tonight. It's hard to look at everything.
[14:05.510 --> 14:05.890]  It is.
[14:06.090 --> 14:07.050]  We almost need zones.
[14:09.410 --> 14:12.550]  Yeah, but I'm not going to help you with my zone, you know what I mean?
[14:12.870 --> 14:13.130]  Yeah.
[14:13.890 --> 14:15.190]  I'm out for number one, baby.
[14:15.890 --> 14:17.890]  I'm trying to win that cake. What kind of cake are you going to get?
[14:18.730 --> 14:19.370]  Are those...
[14:19.370 --> 14:20.330]  Cookie Puss.
[14:20.590 --> 14:21.010]  You're Cookie Puss.
[14:23.710 --> 14:24.250]  What's this?
[14:25.170 --> 14:26.090]  They're just joshing.
[14:28.770 --> 14:30.210]  He spilled all over that dude.
[14:30.290 --> 14:31.150]  I think he spilled...
[14:31.150 --> 14:32.370]  Oh, that counts as a spill.
[14:32.990 --> 14:35.650]  Oh, it's on his shoulder. Yeah, he spilled.
[14:35.990 --> 14:36.490]  Alright, cool.
[14:36.830 --> 14:36.990]  Spill.
[14:37.470 --> 14:40.210]  Got it. Spilled. Boom, boom, boom. I'm getting there.
[14:40.850 --> 14:44.410]  I am too... If I got a beach goth and a trip, baby, I got a bingo.
[14:44.830 --> 14:45.950]  How are you so good at this game?
[14:46.290 --> 14:47.170]  I'm good, baby.
[14:47.210 --> 14:48.210]  He wants sugar.
[14:48.530 --> 14:51.250]  I'm a couple fight and like a mummy walking by.
[14:51.930 --> 14:54.650]  And I got this. I need a bandage dude real bad.
[14:54.830 --> 14:55.730]  I'm not even close.
[14:56.610 --> 14:57.770]  Oh, that dude from Jersey Shore.
[14:58.430 --> 15:00.330]  I need pinking. That's going to be a tough one.
[15:00.910 --> 15:02.690]  Jeans... God damn it. No, God damn it.
[15:03.250 --> 15:04.150]  Wear some sandals.
[15:04.610 --> 15:07.230]  I'm just looking out for jeans now because it's so rare.
[15:07.750 --> 15:07.890]  Yeah.
[15:08.090 --> 15:09.470]  Oh, that's not a party.
[15:10.190 --> 15:11.350]  She's got the bride thing on.
[15:11.490 --> 15:12.730]  Oh, you're right. You're right.
[15:13.230 --> 15:14.790]  Oh, and that's the bride just walked out.
[15:15.310 --> 15:15.990]  Yeah, there you go.
[15:16.130 --> 15:17.930]  I mean, if you didn't have a dumb hat before...
[15:19.030 --> 15:19.950]  Is that a cowboy hat?
[15:20.150 --> 15:21.450]  Is that a cowboy hat too?
[15:21.450 --> 15:22.770]  That's a cowboy hat.
[15:23.090 --> 15:23.490]  Yes.
[15:23.910 --> 15:24.910]  Sunglasses at night.
[15:25.330 --> 15:25.930]  This guy...
[15:25.930 --> 15:26.210]  Yeah, that's a dumb hat.
[15:26.210 --> 15:27.490]  This is what we were talking...
[15:27.490 --> 15:28.810]  This guy's a golden snitch.
[15:30.430 --> 15:32.890]  Now if he just drops something at a party...
[15:34.370 --> 15:35.790]  Turn around, show us the mullet.
[15:35.870 --> 15:36.750]  Turn around, show us the mullet.
[15:37.710 --> 15:39.090]  Be afraid of the camera, dude.
[15:39.410 --> 15:39.850]  Be shy.
[15:40.090 --> 15:40.510]  Give us the mullet.
[15:40.530 --> 15:41.070]  Give us the mullet.
[15:42.370 --> 15:43.670]  That's a definite kid.
[15:43.810 --> 15:45.190]  That is a kid that should be in bed.
[15:45.490 --> 15:46.230]  Top of the screen.
[15:46.690 --> 15:48.110]  Oh, that's definitely a kid.
[15:48.310 --> 15:49.190]  That's a definite kid.
[15:50.070 --> 15:51.030]  Put that kid to bed.
[15:51.450 --> 15:52.610]  It's way too late.
[15:52.630 --> 15:53.630]  Come on!
[15:54.190 --> 15:55.330]  This is what happens...
[15:55.330 --> 15:56.290]  Also, the dog.
[15:56.410 --> 15:56.970]  Put the dog...
[15:56.970 --> 15:59.070]  Dog doesn't want to be out drinking at midnight.
[15:59.490 --> 15:59.710]  Dude.
[16:00.650 --> 16:05.570]  Geoff, we are like one minute away from slop o'clock and so much happened in 30 seconds.
[16:05.610 --> 16:07.190]  Because of the ramp up, man.
[16:07.570 --> 16:08.390]  It's a crescendo.
[16:08.910 --> 16:11.430]  That guy with the hat needs to go in the Hall of Fame.
[16:11.870 --> 16:12.410]  Oh, shit.
[16:12.810 --> 16:14.090]  She stormed off.
[16:14.190 --> 16:15.070]  You fucked up, buddy.
[16:15.090 --> 16:15.510]  Sitting on the ground.
[16:15.730 --> 16:16.570]  American flag.
[16:16.770 --> 16:17.770]  American flag hat.
[16:17.870 --> 16:18.810]  That's American flag clothes.
[16:18.930 --> 16:19.730]  And you acknowledge yourself.
[16:19.770 --> 16:20.210]  Yeah!
[16:20.210 --> 16:22.510]  You fucked up.
[16:22.590 --> 16:23.110]  Oh, my God.
[16:23.190 --> 16:23.990]  That's so much.
[16:24.250 --> 16:24.710]  Oh, this...
[16:24.710 --> 16:26.850]  I am fucking cooking right now.
[16:27.470 --> 16:28.910]  I need a bandage, dude.
[16:29.490 --> 16:32.770]  I am a puke.
[16:32.850 --> 16:34.150]  I'm puking away from...
[16:35.730 --> 16:37.790]  What did the camera acknowledge?
[16:39.830 --> 16:40.790]  Trying to get in the wrong car.
[16:40.790 --> 16:41.830]  Did you puke, dude?
[16:44.730 --> 16:46.310]  That dude peeled out.
[16:46.670 --> 16:48.410]  Oh, somebody's sitting on the curb, sitting down.
[16:48.530 --> 16:48.950]  Yeah, man.
[16:48.950 --> 16:51.310]  I screamed about it.
[16:52.990 --> 16:54.230]  Oh, it's a double fisted...
[16:54.230 --> 16:55.050]  Oh, it's a chili dog.
[16:55.210 --> 16:56.310]  Is that sucking on a chili dog?
[16:56.390 --> 16:57.450]  But he's not sucking on it.
[16:57.450 --> 16:58.450]  We didn't see him suck on it.
[16:58.470 --> 16:58.890]  That's okay.
[16:58.950 --> 17:00.430]  If he's got it in his hand, you know he's eating it.
[17:00.570 --> 17:01.210]  Oh, sick.
[17:01.870 --> 17:03.050]  Jeans shorts and sandals?
[17:03.230 --> 17:04.070]  Nah, you know what?
[17:04.130 --> 17:05.050]  We should see him eat it.
[17:05.230 --> 17:06.410]  It's jeans, baby.
[17:06.850 --> 17:09.090]  Oh, there's the manager of Sloppy Joe's making his rounds.
[17:09.090 --> 17:09.230]  Is that him?
[17:09.750 --> 17:10.110]  That's Joe.
[17:11.530 --> 17:12.250]  That's Slop.
[17:13.770 --> 17:15.710]  He's got his Bluetooth in.
[17:16.390 --> 17:17.110]  Slopovich Joe.
[17:17.870 --> 17:18.570]  Slopovich Joe.
[17:22.200 --> 17:22.960]  Oh, man.
[17:23.040 --> 17:23.860]  Is that Beach Goth?
[17:24.820 --> 17:25.440]  No, no.
[17:25.660 --> 17:26.340]  That's a normal...
[17:26.340 --> 17:26.840]  No, I'm sorry.
[17:26.900 --> 17:27.940]  That's just a normal person.
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.040]  Oh, they both have nighttime shades just on the hat.
[17:30.280 --> 17:31.180]  Yeah, nighttime...
[17:31.180 --> 17:32.820]  Dude, that nighttime shades guy was huge.
[17:33.120 --> 17:33.880]  That was huge.
[17:36.540 --> 17:38.440]  I want to see somebody get in the wrong car.
[17:38.800 --> 17:41.540]  Again, if somebody throws up right now, I got free cake.
[17:42.740 --> 17:43.900]  I just want a cake.
[17:44.500 --> 17:46.000]  It's a little early for puke.
[17:46.000 --> 17:46.880]  This is what I...
[17:46.880 --> 17:49.660]  What I learned about Nick is that he just wants free food.
[17:49.660 --> 17:51.100]  He doesn't really care what it is.
[17:51.240 --> 17:51.600]  Yeah.
[17:51.860 --> 17:52.620]  Yeah, that's true.
[17:54.380 --> 17:56.640]  Oh, is this matching outfits crossing the street in the back there?
[17:57.100 --> 17:58.040]  No, I think...
[17:58.040 --> 17:59.280]  I think they just happen to be...
[17:59.280 --> 17:59.360]  No.
[17:59.380 --> 18:00.120]  No, they're tops.
[18:00.260 --> 18:01.160]  No, no, no, they're tops.
[18:01.280 --> 18:02.100]  The tops are different.
[18:02.240 --> 18:03.320]  The other doesn't, yeah.
[18:03.840 --> 18:04.520]  It's close.
[18:08.070 --> 18:09.270]  Oh, that guy's fucking...
[18:09.850 --> 18:10.210]  Well...
[18:10.610 --> 18:12.170]  He's got the drunk backup.
[18:12.650 --> 18:16.250]  Geoff, I will say, it hit slop o'clock and the people started flooding in the street.
[18:16.650 --> 18:17.290]  Yeah, man.
[18:17.290 --> 18:18.610]  It gets wild real fast.
[18:20.570 --> 18:22.010]  Oh, careful of the cup, dude.
[18:22.170 --> 18:22.930]  Oh, he's down.
[18:23.230 --> 18:23.950]  Fall next time.
[18:24.170 --> 18:25.230]  Hey, his buddy's helping him.
[18:25.410 --> 18:25.930]  He gotcha.
[18:26.590 --> 18:27.870]  Yeah, please trip next time, though.
[18:28.790 --> 18:29.390]  Oh, is that...
[18:29.390 --> 18:30.450]  That was almost a coward.
[18:30.770 --> 18:32.070]  It was almost a coward.
[18:32.330 --> 18:33.150]  That was so close.
[18:33.210 --> 18:33.750]  I was watching it.
[18:34.110 --> 18:35.950]  Oh, there's that cool-looking luxury car.
[18:38.110 --> 18:40.570]  Do you remember when that lady stormed off from that guy?
[18:40.650 --> 18:41.910]  Do you think that counts as a couple fight?
[18:42.150 --> 18:42.590]  Yeah, I do.
[18:43.110 --> 18:43.290]  Okay.
[18:44.410 --> 18:45.990]  I mean, it doesn't really...
[18:45.990 --> 18:47.850]  If you storm away from somebody...
[18:48.750 --> 18:49.110]  Dancing.
[18:50.570 --> 18:51.290]  Oh, yes.
[18:51.570 --> 18:51.930]  Awesome.
[18:53.670 --> 18:54.630]  He's so gone.
[18:54.810 --> 18:56.550]  Whoa, he just threw that in the sewer.
[18:56.670 --> 18:57.350]  What is that?
[18:57.750 --> 18:59.510]  That guy just littered.
[18:59.630 --> 19:00.910]  No, he just threw his drink.
[19:00.990 --> 19:03.310]  He threw the cup away, but he just tossed the rest of his drink.
[19:03.450 --> 19:03.650]  He littered ice.
[19:03.650 --> 19:04.230]  He did litter ice.
[19:04.790 --> 19:05.950]  Now this car's gonna slip.
[19:06.010 --> 19:06.670]  Oh, no, be careful.
[19:06.750 --> 19:07.570]  Oh, no, look out.
[19:09.250 --> 19:10.330]  It's like a banana peel.
[19:13.270 --> 19:13.830]  Oh, he's had to...
[19:13.830 --> 19:14.570]  What's in the bag?
[19:14.870 --> 19:16.310]  You want it so bad, Gavin.
[19:16.310 --> 19:17.850]  I just want double fisting.
[19:18.050 --> 19:18.490]  I hear that.
[19:18.590 --> 19:19.010]  That guy's going fishing.
[19:19.570 --> 19:21.390]  I need jeans and sandals.
[19:21.870 --> 19:24.670]  The other night, a couple of dudes got in front of the camera,
[19:24.810 --> 19:26.170]  and they each drank a six-pack,
[19:26.350 --> 19:28.690]  and every time they downed a can of beer,
[19:28.930 --> 19:29.870]  they would hump it.
[19:30.090 --> 19:30.870]  It was pretty wild.
[19:31.350 --> 19:31.970]  That's awesome.
[19:32.510 --> 19:34.030]  They were double fisting the whole time.
[19:34.370 --> 19:36.650]  How have we not seen the ghost tour bus?
[19:36.690 --> 19:38.410]  We saw it before we, like, started,
[19:38.830 --> 19:39.810]  and it's not here.
[19:39.990 --> 19:41.070]  I know, but come on.
[19:41.230 --> 19:42.910]  Maybe that one's for a haunted Marriott.
[19:44.270 --> 19:46.930]  Is there a cover band playing tonight?
[19:47.130 --> 19:48.630]  I can't hear any music.
[19:49.570 --> 19:50.370]  I'm keeping...
[19:50.370 --> 19:52.290]  I don't know that a band is playing right now.
[19:52.310 --> 19:52.570]  Okay.
[19:52.690 --> 19:53.330]  I don't think there is.
[19:53.990 --> 19:54.590]  Fuck, yeah.
[19:54.670 --> 19:55.930]  I think I'm just fucked for that line.
[19:55.970 --> 19:56.390]  Oh, what?
[19:57.250 --> 19:58.010]  Look at that bike.
[19:58.210 --> 19:59.130]  Oh, she got pizza, though.
[20:01.850 --> 20:02.650]  I'm so...
[20:02.650 --> 20:04.590]  Dude, I'm looking at legs.
[20:04.970 --> 20:06.710]  Give me some sandals and jeans.
[20:06.710 --> 20:07.430]  I know, dude.
[20:07.630 --> 20:08.330]  Like, come on.
[20:09.290 --> 20:10.070]  Get real.
[20:10.510 --> 20:12.150]  Did that woman have jeans and sandals?
[20:13.390 --> 20:14.090]  Dude, if I...
[20:14.890 --> 20:17.070]  She's in the white in the upper right-hand corner,
[20:17.230 --> 20:18.550]  walking towards the Chili Dog stand.
[20:19.630 --> 20:20.590]  She's out of range.
[20:21.870 --> 20:23.130]  She'll be back for the Chili Dog.
[20:23.230 --> 20:24.170]  She's out of range.
[20:24.690 --> 20:25.750]  I've been playing too many games.
[20:28.590 --> 20:29.570]  This is so much fun.
[20:29.570 --> 20:31.030]  I'm so glad we're getting to play this again.
[20:31.290 --> 20:31.670]  Oh, me too.
[20:31.890 --> 20:33.130]  When we played it the first time,
[20:33.190 --> 20:34.470]  it was, like, the most fun I'd ever had.
[20:35.710 --> 20:37.830]  We should talk about RTXs coming up,
[20:37.850 --> 20:38.770]  and we're gonna have the...
[20:38.770 --> 20:39.650]  Nick, get ready for the bleep.
[20:39.730 --> 20:39.870]  Ready?
[20:41.230 --> 20:43.070]  Three, two, one.
[20:44.470 --> 20:44.690]  Bleep.
[20:45.010 --> 20:45.410]  Museum.
[20:45.990 --> 20:46.790]  That's good.
[20:47.090 --> 20:47.630]  That was great.
[20:48.170 --> 20:48.490]  Thank you.
[20:48.790 --> 20:50.730]  And we're gonna have so many different things there.
[20:50.790 --> 20:51.950]  You guys have to come to RTX.
[20:52.170 --> 20:53.890]  I think you can save, like, 10% or something.
[20:53.890 --> 20:54.610]  Is that matching outfits?
[20:54.930 --> 20:56.150]  Oh, they're hard-hugging.
[20:56.450 --> 20:57.510]  That is not matching outfits.
[20:57.950 --> 20:59.750]  No, their tops are totally different.
[21:00.030 --> 21:00.190]  Yeah.
[21:00.470 --> 21:02.670]  Use code SNOOZERLOOZE and you save, like, 10%, I think.
[21:02.730 --> 21:04.430]  Or you get an extra badge or something.
[21:04.790 --> 21:05.670]  That dude's got cargo shorts.
[21:07.890 --> 21:08.570]  Great, Nick.
[21:08.570 --> 21:09.970]  You just excited about that?
[21:10.490 --> 21:12.350]  You don't see those in the wild too much anymore.
[21:12.650 --> 21:15.250]  I've gotten a note that Andrew's mic isn't loud enough.
[21:15.850 --> 21:17.590]  Andrew, get closer to your microphone.
[21:18.070 --> 21:19.270]  I'm on top of my mic.
[21:19.670 --> 21:20.150]  Oh, there you are.
[21:20.690 --> 21:21.810]  Yeah. Oh, now I hear you.
[21:21.810 --> 21:22.490]  Oh, now I hear you, too.
[21:24.010 --> 21:24.930]  Somebody dropped something.
[21:26.230 --> 21:27.010]  What was that?
[21:27.450 --> 21:28.890]  Sorry, he was too close to the microphone.
[21:29.210 --> 21:30.310]  I don't know what you want from me.
[21:30.450 --> 21:30.830]  Back away.
[21:32.590 --> 21:34.230]  Also, they may not hear the bleeps.
[21:35.010 --> 21:35.290]  Cool.
[21:35.730 --> 21:37.570]  Oh, that's funny for us, then.
[21:37.570 --> 21:38.210]  Yeah.
[21:39.690 --> 21:41.470]  I don't really care what the bleep's going on.
[21:41.470 --> 21:42.770]  I mean, honestly, as long as I like it.
[21:42.790 --> 21:43.490]  Oh, jeans.
[21:43.610 --> 21:44.510]  Oh, that guy just grabbed his crotch.
[21:44.650 --> 21:46.670]  That was a crotch grab.
[21:46.830 --> 21:47.670]  That was a crotch grab.
[21:47.970 --> 21:48.250]  That guy.
[21:48.710 --> 21:50.210]  Oh, I'm trying to get...
[21:50.210 --> 21:51.030]  Oh, my jeans and sandals.
[21:51.170 --> 21:52.370]  I got it. That's jeans and sandals.
[21:52.490 --> 21:52.950]  Okay, hang on.
[21:53.830 --> 21:55.450]  I just need a cop car and ambulance.
[21:55.610 --> 21:57.210]  Jeans and flip flops. Where's the crotch grab?
[21:57.650 --> 21:58.470]  Oh, my God.
[21:58.750 --> 21:59.810]  Did we get jeans and sandals?
[22:00.110 --> 22:01.210]  Yeah, I got jeans and sandals.
[22:01.310 --> 22:03.190]  Oh, my God, I'm so close to a fucking bingo.
[22:03.610 --> 22:05.690]  I am, too. I need camera shy and cop car.
[22:05.690 --> 22:07.970]  Give me a coward for a cake.
[22:08.170 --> 22:09.130]  I just need cop car.
[22:10.190 --> 22:10.990]  Give me...
[22:10.990 --> 22:12.110]  Cops are all over the place.
[22:12.330 --> 22:13.010]  Give me camera shy.
[22:13.410 --> 22:15.070]  Give me trying to get in the wrong car.
[22:16.990 --> 22:19.190]  I'm so glad we got jeans and flip flops.
[22:19.350 --> 22:19.890]  I am, too.
[22:20.030 --> 22:20.550]  I was going to lose my fucking mind.
[22:21.330 --> 22:22.830]  You don't have to look at legs anymore.
[22:22.990 --> 22:23.850]  Yeah, you can look up now.
[22:24.370 --> 22:25.930]  I can look at the rest of the bodies.
[22:28.130 --> 22:28.870]  Drop something!
[22:30.670 --> 22:31.310]  What do you mean?
[22:31.510 --> 22:32.970]  How did you not...
[22:32.970 --> 22:34.270]  The ice cubes.
[22:34.270 --> 22:35.890]  Yeah, but that was a throw.
[22:36.050 --> 22:36.570]  That was a throw.
[22:36.710 --> 22:37.010]  That was a drop.
[22:37.210 --> 22:37.970]  That's a good point.
[22:38.950 --> 22:39.190]  That's a good point.
[22:39.210 --> 22:40.690]  Oh, chest! Drop one! Drop one!
[22:44.150 --> 22:45.350]  Fall on the street. Fall on the street.
[22:45.510 --> 22:48.190]  There's... Now we're getting jeans and flip flops all we want.
[22:48.570 --> 22:49.050]  Left and right.
[22:49.470 --> 22:51.250]  That's an embarrassment of jeans and flip flops.
[22:52.150 --> 22:53.650]  Meanwhile, where's the go-kart?
[22:53.750 --> 22:54.990]  Where's the guy-on-guy scooter?
[22:56.570 --> 22:57.130]  I'll match...
[22:57.850 --> 22:58.970]  Somebody take a selfie.
[22:59.030 --> 23:00.550]  Jeans and flip flops again.
[23:00.630 --> 23:01.810]  I'm pissed. Shut up.
[23:02.170 --> 23:03.530]  Someone hide from the camera.
[23:08.980 --> 23:12.000]  This is... Man. It's sloppy. Joe's Bingo rules.
[23:12.600 --> 23:13.960]  It's great on a Friday night.
[23:14.160 --> 23:15.180]  Oh, this is awesome.
[23:15.200 --> 23:17.620]  Oh, notice the camera and then look away, you shy fucker.
[23:17.740 --> 23:17.880]  No.
[23:17.940 --> 23:18.520]  You wish.
[23:19.160 --> 23:20.140]  Please! Please!
[23:20.520 --> 23:20.560]  No!
[23:20.560 --> 23:23.380]  I did it! I got a bingo!
[23:24.280 --> 23:25.240]  So, who got a bingo?
[23:25.580 --> 23:26.000]  I did.
[23:26.120 --> 23:26.720]  Nick got it.
[23:26.840 --> 23:27.560]  Nick got a bingo!
[23:28.260 --> 23:30.840]  Okay, Nick. What did you get on your bingo?
[23:31.180 --> 23:32.960]  Okay, I got jeans and flip flops.
[23:33.200 --> 23:33.640]  Cop car.
[23:34.140 --> 23:34.340]  Okay.
[23:34.500 --> 23:35.920]  Drop spilled food drink.
[23:36.580 --> 23:38.780]  This one, I don't know. I thought we called... What?
[23:39.740 --> 23:41.780]  Is that a drop? I thought we said that was a throw.
[23:41.880 --> 23:43.060]  No, that was a different one.
[23:43.220 --> 23:45.780]  There was a guy who spilled his drink on his friend.
[23:46.180 --> 23:47.400]  Yeah, all over his friend's shoulder.
[23:47.720 --> 23:48.880]  That was the last one, Nick.
[23:49.180 --> 23:52.440]  I clicked this one, but I'm realizing now this may not be it.
[23:52.520 --> 23:53.600]  Litter bug, did we call that one?
[23:54.420 --> 23:55.000]  No, that was...
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.860]  I was making a joke about the guy throwing ice.
[23:58.020 --> 23:59.540]  Whoa! Premature bingo!
[24:00.180 --> 24:00.900]  Premature bingo.
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.340]  Well, guess what? All I need is a selfie.
[24:04.040 --> 24:05.120]  All I need is camera shy.
[24:05.120 --> 24:06.240]  God damn it.
[24:06.320 --> 24:07.200]  That's the opposite.
[24:07.580 --> 24:08.340]  I stopped looking at the crosswalk.
[24:08.540 --> 24:09.020]  I thought we were done.
[24:09.020 --> 24:09.760]  Trying to get a little car.
[24:10.060 --> 24:10.380]  Damn.
[24:16.320 --> 24:16.840]  Oh, look.
[24:17.100 --> 24:19.340]  She acknowledged, well, we don't need it, I guess.
[24:19.900 --> 24:20.660]  There's a dumb hat.
[24:21.020 --> 24:22.540]  Oh, giant drink!
[24:24.280 --> 24:25.900]  Now I got to add giant drink to the list.
[24:27.080 --> 24:29.160]  I feel like, oh, you guys have cupcakes now or something.
[24:34.600 --> 24:35.240]  Come on.
[24:35.360 --> 24:38.020]  How disappointed are you going to be, Nick, if you don't end up winning?
[24:38.020 --> 24:41.960]  Yeah, when I get a selfie, dude, when I see somebody take a selfie, oh, you're so fucked.
[24:42.220 --> 24:44.500]  Somebody tries to get in the wrong car, you're fucked.
[24:44.760 --> 24:47.140]  I'm going to eat my whole cookie puss in front of you, bro.
[24:47.960 --> 24:48.320]  Oof.
[24:49.700 --> 24:50.580]  No, I want some.
[24:50.580 --> 24:51.180]  What is sentence?
[24:53.200 --> 24:54.240]  Give him one of the arms.
[24:56.440 --> 24:58.420]  I'll eat a finger.
[24:59.840 --> 25:01.680]  A little red jelly hand.
[25:03.160 --> 25:05.340]  It's not a lot of people dropping anything.
[25:05.860 --> 25:06.520]  Yeah, drop something.
[25:07.560 --> 25:08.780]  Drop your phone, guy.
[25:08.940 --> 25:10.240]  He dropped out of frame all of a sudden.
[25:12.320 --> 25:13.460]  Whoa, those are short shorts.
[25:13.480 --> 25:15.320]  Yeah, if the stream drops, does that count?
[25:15.780 --> 25:16.160]  No.
[25:16.840 --> 25:17.320]  No.
[25:17.920 --> 25:21.180]  If a person trips and falls to the ground, did they drop themselves?
[25:21.460 --> 25:24.260]  No, because that's a trip, which is a different thing.
[25:26.920 --> 25:27.400]  Okay.
[25:28.520 --> 25:29.320]  That guy's pretty tall.
[25:32.600 --> 25:40.900]  The thing that I said about this when we were done with it the first time is that what I really enjoy about this is that it's people watching with no consequence.
[25:42.940 --> 25:48.180]  Like, this is being on the street without ever having to fucking step foot on this street.
[25:48.340 --> 25:49.940]  Yeah, I don't have to smell any of this.
[25:51.460 --> 25:54.360]  And you don't have to lean over and nudge someone else to look.
[25:54.360 --> 26:06.240]  It's like the other day, Gus and Eric and I went down to Dirty 6, which is like the bar scene street in Austin, to get lunch and film an episode of a podcast.
[26:06.960 --> 26:09.880]  It's called Anma. You can plug it. It's your other show.
[26:10.300 --> 26:10.760]  Oh, yeah.
[26:11.060 --> 26:12.900]  While you're being fucking cagey about it.
[26:13.060 --> 26:21.020]  We went to Casino El Camino to record an episode and I forgot just how piss-smelly that street is.
[26:21.100 --> 26:21.540]  Oh, yeah.
[26:22.560 --> 26:25.180]  Just smells like stale everything and urine.
[26:25.620 --> 26:27.700]  Drop your card. Drop your ID.
[26:28.100 --> 26:28.540]  Go on.
[26:29.160 --> 26:30.580]  Just throw something. Do anything.
[26:30.780 --> 26:31.260]  Butterfingers.
[26:33.880 --> 26:34.360]  Butterwallet.
[26:34.420 --> 26:36.640]  It gets real hard when you're down to the last few.
[26:36.980 --> 26:38.260]  That guy's hoofing it. That counts.
[26:38.440 --> 26:39.020]  That's hoofing it.
[26:39.180 --> 26:40.540]  I like it. I like it.
[26:41.880 --> 26:42.360]  Okay.
[26:44.380 --> 26:46.160]  Where's the goddamn go-kart?
[26:46.300 --> 26:48.360]  The lack of matching outfits tonight.
[26:48.960 --> 26:49.360]  I know.
[26:49.360 --> 26:50.460]  I know.
[26:50.680 --> 26:56.500]  Usually, you get a couple of like a bunch of Guy Fieri's or Hulk Hogan's or some dumb costume at least.
[26:57.100 --> 26:58.360]  I haven't seen any pink taxis either.
[26:58.640 --> 26:58.820]  No.
[26:59.700 --> 27:01.840]  Also, ghost tour bus? Dude, where are you?
[27:02.040 --> 27:04.420]  Yeah, or the cute train, street train.
[27:05.100 --> 27:05.680]  Ghost guy.
[27:05.700 --> 27:07.080]  I don't think I've ever seen that.
[27:07.800 --> 27:10.300]  It's earlier in the day usually, the street train.
[27:11.960 --> 27:12.740]  Coward? Coward?
[27:13.240 --> 27:13.640]  Coward?
[27:13.840 --> 27:14.860]  He's trying to get a ride.
[27:15.620 --> 27:16.060]  John Cena.
[27:21.360 --> 27:23.420]  As everybody's Friday, they may have a good time.
[27:23.620 --> 27:24.020]  Oh!
[27:26.020 --> 27:26.820]  Good Lord.
[27:27.200 --> 27:27.720]  Well, that was count.
[27:27.720 --> 27:28.320]  This is insane.
[27:28.500 --> 27:30.480]  Is that a Meemaw on a tricycle?
[27:32.380 --> 27:34.180]  Can a Meemaw be on a tricycle?
[27:34.360 --> 27:36.280]  Well, that's a golden sitch situation, you know?
[27:36.780 --> 27:37.240]  That's a, yeah.
[27:38.600 --> 27:39.760]  It's the golden Meemaw.
[27:39.820 --> 27:40.840]  Oh, he's double bagging.
[27:41.260 --> 27:42.100]  Drop the bags.
[27:42.800 --> 27:43.420]  Drop the bags.
[27:43.780 --> 27:45.120]  Dude, get friends.
[27:45.480 --> 27:47.020]  Go anywhere. Park the car.
[27:47.140 --> 27:49.220]  Dude, here's my fucking luxury car right there, bro.
[27:49.220 --> 27:52.360]  God damn. Up and down the street all night long.
[27:53.740 --> 27:54.380]  That's expensive.
[27:56.440 --> 27:57.800]  Any of these double fisted?
[27:58.240 --> 27:58.480]  No.
[27:58.640 --> 28:01.540]  I had a good Friday. There was a lot going on.
[28:01.620 --> 28:02.960]  This is such a great way to cap it, dude.
[28:03.260 --> 28:04.260]  This is like so fun.
[28:05.940 --> 28:08.300]  This will be up on the site within a week, too.
[28:08.460 --> 28:09.760]  So if you're like only watching part of this.
[28:10.080 --> 28:10.760]  Is that a cap?
[28:11.720 --> 28:12.040]  Nope.
[28:12.240 --> 28:13.280]  Oh, God damn it.
[28:13.340 --> 28:14.500]  That could have been a coward situation.
[28:14.980 --> 28:15.960]  It could have been. It was real close.
[28:16.000 --> 28:16.880]  Is that what you need, Andrew?
[28:17.280 --> 28:18.240]  That's all I need.
[28:18.240 --> 28:18.960]  Those wedges.
[28:20.140 --> 28:21.540]  Yeah, so everybody needs...
[28:21.540 --> 28:22.120]  What are the...
[28:22.120 --> 28:26.020]  Like, I need either trying to get into the wrong car or camera shy.
[28:26.300 --> 28:29.060]  Nick, you need litterbug, right?
[28:29.220 --> 28:29.580]  Yeah.
[28:29.840 --> 28:33.440]  I need to either drop something or almost get hit by a car.
[28:36.680 --> 28:40.640]  I'm so mad that there's two security guys in frame with different security shirts on.
[28:40.740 --> 28:40.920]  Yep.
[28:43.120 --> 28:45.460]  Yeah, only pink is Sloppy Joe's.
[28:45.500 --> 28:47.580]  They color coordinate all the different restaurants.
[28:47.580 --> 28:48.320]  Get in the frame.
[28:49.120 --> 28:50.740]  Get in the frame, other security guy.
[28:50.940 --> 28:54.500]  Oh, you're not going to count two security guards as matching outfits?
[28:54.500 --> 28:55.720]  You can't tell me that's not a matching outfit?
[28:55.760 --> 28:56.880]  No, that doesn't count.
[28:56.980 --> 28:58.220]  How does that not count?
[28:58.280 --> 28:59.120]  Hey, did you see the...
[28:59.120 --> 28:59.320]  It's the same outfit.
[28:59.660 --> 29:00.660]  Did you see the one-wheels, Gavin?
[29:00.880 --> 29:03.240]  Yeah, the two one-wheels almost hit each other.
[29:03.860 --> 29:04.740]  Two loser boats.
[29:09.040 --> 29:10.980]  I gotta say, everybody's...
[29:10.980 --> 29:11.800]  Well, no, never mind.
[29:11.880 --> 29:13.280]  That old dude's looking a little wobbly.
[29:13.660 --> 29:16.080]  That's how everybody's holding their alcohol pretty well tonight, but...
[29:16.080 --> 29:17.180]  I think that might just be him.
[29:21.920 --> 29:22.280]  Somebody...
[29:22.280 --> 29:24.700]  We have not had a crosswalk coward, and that's crazy.
[29:24.960 --> 29:25.280]  Yeah.
[29:26.060 --> 29:28.500]  I was thinking maybe I should go through and explain some of the...
[29:28.500 --> 29:29.940]  Maybe the more confusing ones.
[29:30.320 --> 29:31.420]  Guy-on-guy scooter.
[29:31.640 --> 29:32.020]  Come on!
[29:32.100 --> 29:34.300]  As you'll see it, it's when two dudes are on a scooter...
[29:34.300 --> 29:35.060]  Get back! Get back to the crosswalk!
[29:35.160 --> 29:35.700]  ...and they don't want to touch each other.
[29:35.940 --> 29:36.260]  Come back!
[29:36.640 --> 29:37.520]  It's pretty common.
[29:37.620 --> 29:38.380]  What are you doing?
[29:38.580 --> 29:39.680]  He's confused about where to go.
[29:39.780 --> 29:40.220]  What do you mean?
[29:40.340 --> 29:41.320]  He's crossing, maybe?
[29:41.700 --> 29:42.160]  Ah, damn.
[29:42.880 --> 29:43.600]  Oh, man.
[29:44.160 --> 29:44.580]  Pick taxi!
[29:45.720 --> 29:46.280]  Pick taxi!
[29:46.440 --> 29:46.880]  There you go.
[29:47.480 --> 29:48.620]  I don't need it.
[29:48.700 --> 29:49.500]  There's a cowboy hat.
[29:49.760 --> 29:50.460]  Nobody needs that.
[29:51.240 --> 29:52.720]  He's also a dead parrot head.
[29:57.530 --> 30:01.770]  Guy riding smallest bike wearing headphones has to be the most dangerous thing you can be doing.
[30:03.370 --> 30:04.810]  Might as well be blindfolded.
[30:05.170 --> 30:07.890]  A lot of people ask, when you say go-kart, what do you mean?
[30:07.970 --> 30:09.750]  We mean an honest-to-God go-kart.
[30:09.890 --> 30:12.290]  It rips up and down the street all night long.
[30:13.210 --> 30:15.290]  I just need someone to toss a cigarette on the ground.
[30:15.430 --> 30:15.830]  Please.
[30:18.150 --> 30:18.830]  Oh, man.
[30:19.370 --> 30:23.810]  Emily and I were trying to figure out what the hardest one to get is yesterday.
[30:24.530 --> 30:26.510]  And I think it might be puking.
[30:27.090 --> 30:29.070]  Twerking doesn't happen nearly as much.
[30:29.410 --> 30:31.110]  Yeah, mullets are quite rare.
[30:31.310 --> 30:32.890]  Andrew would definitely say wheelchair.
[30:33.090 --> 30:34.070]  I don't think he's ever seen a wheelchair.
[30:36.290 --> 30:37.690]  Oh, that lady's taking a selfie.
[30:37.750 --> 30:38.590]  Oh, selfie, Dawson?
[30:38.910 --> 30:39.070]  Selfie!
[30:39.210 --> 30:40.030]  Hell yeah!
[30:40.430 --> 30:41.190]  I got selfie.
[30:41.630 --> 30:42.790]  That's a bingo, friends.
[30:43.250 --> 30:44.150]  Oh, damn it.
[30:44.250 --> 30:44.970]  God damn it.
[30:44.970 --> 30:45.250]  Damn.
[30:45.250 --> 30:46.650]  Are you serious?
[30:46.990 --> 30:51.410]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have one Sloppy Joe bingo once again.
[30:51.670 --> 30:52.130]  Cop car?
[30:52.450 --> 30:52.670]  That's a video, though.
[30:53.190 --> 30:54.090]  Cop car?
[30:54.550 --> 30:55.450]  Nah, that's a video.
[30:55.710 --> 30:55.990]  Crotch grab?
[30:56.470 --> 30:57.170]  Cowboy hat?
[30:57.530 --> 30:57.950]  Selfie.
[30:58.290 --> 30:59.150]  No, it's a video.
[30:59.290 --> 30:59.750]  It's not a selfie.
[30:59.990 --> 31:01.330]  She is filming herself.
[31:01.570 --> 31:02.450]  That's a definite video.
[31:02.830 --> 31:03.410]  No way!
[31:03.830 --> 31:04.450]  It's not a selfie.
[31:06.050 --> 31:07.750]  Oh, come on!
[31:07.990 --> 31:09.310]  Or she's talking to someone on the phone.
[31:10.050 --> 31:12.470]  Could somebody put that man in a wheelchair?
[31:13.170 --> 31:14.130]  Are you kidding me?
[31:16.290 --> 31:17.730]  Am I saying no bingo?
[31:18.470 --> 31:18.730]  No.
[31:19.210 --> 31:21.270]  Dude, I was all about giving it to you.
[31:21.270 --> 31:22.790]  Also, offensive shirt for sure.
[31:23.090 --> 31:24.490]  So, that's, I mean, just in case.
[31:24.750 --> 31:25.190]  What did it say?
[31:25.270 --> 31:25.790]  Dirt cock?
[31:26.090 --> 31:26.430]  What did it say?
[31:26.610 --> 31:27.450]  Great cock?
[31:28.450 --> 31:29.090]  Rusty cock?
[31:29.250 --> 31:29.810]  Dust cock?
[31:30.490 --> 31:31.050]  Easy cock?
[31:31.370 --> 31:32.530]  Then I'll say no selfie.
[31:32.870 --> 31:33.250]  Best cock?
[31:33.270 --> 31:34.010]  I mean, I won.
[31:34.110 --> 31:34.890]  It's just, you know.
[31:34.890 --> 31:36.650]  No, dude, I'm all about taking it.
[31:36.650 --> 31:38.510]  Oh, it says best cock on the block.
[31:39.530 --> 31:41.270]  I think it counts, man.
[31:41.410 --> 31:42.230]  Yeah, I think it counts.
[31:42.270 --> 31:42.850]  I think we gotta give it.
[31:43.270 --> 31:43.390]  Alright.
[31:44.350 --> 31:46.630]  Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot wait to eat my cookie puss.
[31:46.770 --> 31:47.630]  I will eat the whole thing.
[31:47.830 --> 31:51.410]  But now I think we continue to blackout.
[31:51.590 --> 31:54.410]  Yeah, we'll just see who gets closest to a blackout before.
[31:54.730 --> 31:57.450]  I think 1055 is when we switch over to the next stream.
[31:57.690 --> 31:58.090]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:58.090 --> 31:59.090]  So, we got 25 minutes.
[31:59.390 --> 32:02.610]  Do you know, man, there is a rise of Tupac shirts around the world.
[32:02.930 --> 32:05.330]  When I was in Italy, every teenager I saw had a Tupac shirt.
[32:05.350 --> 32:06.230]  Everywhere right now.
[32:06.330 --> 32:06.810]  Yeah, for sure.
[32:07.030 --> 32:07.650]  That nirvana.
[32:08.670 --> 32:09.070]  Oh, yeah.
[32:09.150 --> 32:09.750]  A lot of those too.
[32:10.410 --> 32:13.010]  Anyway, Eric, do you know who comes after us?
[32:13.010 --> 32:14.090]  We should plug them.
[32:14.510 --> 32:15.370]  Oh, I have no idea.
[32:15.530 --> 32:15.930]  On the stream.
[32:16.130 --> 32:17.390]  Limblad, let me know if you know.
[32:17.490 --> 32:18.390]  Just slack it to me.
[32:18.550 --> 32:19.370]  Yeah, definitely stick around.
[32:19.450 --> 32:21.430]  I think this thing goes for a few more hours after this.
[32:21.430 --> 32:22.890]  Yeah, if you're watching this...
[32:22.890 --> 32:23.150]  Nick, ready?
[32:23.250 --> 32:23.910]  Are you ready with the beep?
[32:24.890 --> 32:25.450]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:26.090 --> 32:30.550]  Okay, if you're watching this on the...
[32:30.550 --> 32:35.810]  Face YouTube channel, hop on over to the Rooster Teeth YouTube channel or the Rooster Teeth site and you can keep watching.
[32:36.430 --> 32:42.190]  You know, I just want to make sure you guys keep watching because there's more great stuff going on until like 2 AM, which is crazy.
[32:42.190 --> 32:43.630]  Also, go to RTX.
[32:44.410 --> 32:49.250]  Yeah, like come see this museum. Like, I don't think people understand what a museum is really going to be.
[32:49.310 --> 32:52.810]  I like the fact that this museum is like a huge selling point.
[32:52.990 --> 32:54.310]  Well, yeah, because...
[32:54.310 --> 32:55.690]  See a bunch of old shit.
[32:56.170 --> 32:57.350]  You can see...
[32:57.350 --> 32:58.210]  You can see it.
[32:58.210 --> 32:58.930]  Isn't that every museum?
[32:59.530 --> 33:04.630]  We can't legally say what it is, but you know what it is and you can come see it.
[33:04.650 --> 33:06.290]  Did I... that guy's a beach goth.
[33:06.330 --> 33:07.350]  Can I tell you...
[33:07.350 --> 33:08.370]  Oh, he sure is.
[33:08.370 --> 33:19.050]  Can I tell you, Eric, you know, Wes has been asking us to take photos of the museum items next to rulers and stuff so that they can figure out the size of the displays and shit.
[33:19.290 --> 33:20.490]  Do I need to come over and help you?
[33:20.730 --> 33:24.930]  No, no, I did it today, but I don't have a ruler, so I had to use a banana for scale.
[33:25.370 --> 33:28.290]  So everything I took photos of is a banana scale.
[33:28.870 --> 33:29.670]  That's awesome.
[33:30.090 --> 33:30.990]  Who are these guys?
[33:31.210 --> 33:33.070]  He is going to fight the camera.
[33:33.270 --> 33:34.210]  That guy looks desperate.
[33:34.550 --> 33:36.590]  Is that guy falling in love with the camera?
[33:36.790 --> 33:38.210]  Oh, he's ossified.
[33:38.210 --> 33:39.930]  That dude was ripped.
[33:41.410 --> 33:42.290]  That's awesome.
[33:42.510 --> 33:45.950]  Hey, next up here is the AH Halo LAN party.
[33:46.150 --> 33:46.350]  Gaia Guy Scooter!
[33:46.350 --> 33:47.330]  Gaia Guy Scooter right there!
[33:47.430 --> 33:47.810]  Hell yeah!
[33:48.070 --> 33:48.670]  Gaia Guy Scooter!
[33:49.190 --> 33:49.630]  Awesome.
[33:51.110 --> 33:52.830]  Oh, now I just need Ghost Tour bus and I win.
[33:53.210 --> 33:54.070]  Oh, I guess...
[33:54.070 --> 33:54.830]  Well, I mean, I win.
[33:54.850 --> 33:55.750]  Just so you know.
[33:56.010 --> 34:00.510]  So just let me know when I have to use my card to order my own cookie puss.
[34:02.010 --> 34:04.490]  Dude, that's a dead parrot head, right? Like, for sure?
[34:04.870 --> 34:07.890]  That guy with his shirt open looks like he wants to brawl.
[34:07.890 --> 34:10.050]  He is ready to go.
[34:11.930 --> 34:12.470]  He's...
[34:12.470 --> 34:15.000]  He's in a world fucked up.
[34:16.610 --> 34:17.890]  This is crazy.
[34:18.690 --> 34:21.030]  Are they taking a screenshot through the stream selfie?
[34:21.290 --> 34:22.250]  Because that should be on there.
[34:22.270 --> 34:23.330]  I think they are.
[34:23.830 --> 34:24.710]  Is that guy Larry Bird?
[34:28.830 --> 34:30.550]  Yo, what's up? It's us.
[34:30.890 --> 34:31.010]  Cool.
[34:31.290 --> 34:32.940]  They have no idea that...
[34:33.530 --> 34:36.010]  Look, they're watching this on the Sloppy Joe's thing.
[34:36.010 --> 34:39.430]  There are like 3,500 people watching this.
[34:49.990 --> 34:51.530]  No way, that's just long hair.
[34:51.530 --> 34:52.970]  I don't know, I think he's just got long hair, man.
[34:52.990 --> 34:54.610]  But look at the sides, they're all nice and short.
[34:54.830 --> 34:55.850]  Take your hat off, dude.
[34:56.550 --> 34:57.370]  Yeah, take the hat off.
[35:00.830 --> 35:01.470]  This is...
[35:01.470 --> 35:02.570]  Geoff, this is a fuck...
[35:02.570 --> 35:04.090]  You were right about Sloppy Clark, dude.
[35:05.150 --> 35:07.150]  That guy's off to Valhalla.
[35:07.290 --> 35:09.230]  Dude, that guy went for pre-drinks somewhere.
[35:10.850 --> 35:13.250]  These guys have no idea that this is being recorded...
[35:13.770 --> 35:15.530]  and is going to be on our YouTube channel.
[35:17.970 --> 35:19.570]  You trying to sneak up on us, buddy?
[35:21.510 --> 35:21.930]  Oh, shit.
[35:23.410 --> 35:25.830]  Oh, that guy's got two drinks in one hand.
[35:25.850 --> 35:26.850]  Does that count as double fisting?
[35:27.010 --> 35:27.410]  No.
[35:28.890 --> 35:30.450]  Oh, put one drink in the hand.
[35:30.730 --> 35:31.830]  Yeah, that counts, right?
[35:31.830 --> 35:32.790]  How is that...
[35:32.790 --> 35:33.210]  No, why would that...
[35:33.210 --> 35:34.090]  No, that's single fisting.
[35:34.090 --> 35:35.350]  Geoff, you are so...
[35:35.350 --> 35:36.290]  Okay, I guess not.
[35:38.230 --> 35:39.110]  He's teasing me.
[35:39.550 --> 35:40.570]  Come on, come on.
[35:40.590 --> 35:42.010]  Just move it to the other hand.
[35:42.370 --> 35:43.270]  Yeah, just put...
[35:43.270 --> 35:44.850]  He's irresponsible having two in one.
[35:45.170 --> 35:46.130]  This is a mess.
[35:46.130 --> 35:46.470]  He's so close.
[35:46.850 --> 35:48.070]  Come on, you tease.
[35:51.070 --> 35:52.710]  I got double fisting, too.
[35:57.270 --> 35:59.010]  That would be a selfie, by the way.
[35:59.010 --> 36:00.750]  Oh, you can see his screen.
[36:01.970 --> 36:03.830]  That's his drunk friend.
[36:04.110 --> 36:05.130]  Oh, this is awesome.
[36:05.130 --> 36:05.930]  Oh, man, that's great.
[36:06.710 --> 36:09.370]  I would like to think that the old guy is not part of their group.
[36:09.570 --> 36:12.710]  And to rub it in Molly's double fisting.
[36:14.150 --> 36:16.230]  I think someone dropped something in the background.
[36:16.490 --> 36:17.010]  Did you see that?
[36:17.630 --> 36:17.850]  No.
[36:18.910 --> 36:21.230]  Oh, stop. Stop.
[36:23.710 --> 36:25.450]  I need a ruling on what...
[36:25.450 --> 36:26.990]  We don't have the ability to rewind, do we?
[36:27.130 --> 36:27.530]  Shit.
[36:28.110 --> 36:30.550]  I mean, we have the ability. I'm just not going to.
[36:30.550 --> 36:33.550]  Gavin, I saw it. Wink.
[36:35.090 --> 36:36.650]  If that person actually...
[36:36.650 --> 36:37.990]  That's a crotch grab. Look at that.
[36:38.350 --> 36:39.190]  Oh, God.
[36:39.190 --> 36:40.490]  That guy was going for it.
[36:42.870 --> 36:51.050]  If I can get somebody trying to get into the wrong car while on a go-kart and a wheelchair at the same time and eating a chili dog, I'll black out.
[36:52.410 --> 36:52.890]  Oh.
[36:53.010 --> 36:53.870]  If they're camera shy.
[36:54.130 --> 36:54.550]  In the game.
[36:55.470 --> 36:56.750]  These guys just pass out.
[36:57.150 --> 36:58.090]  Yeah, I'll just die.
[36:59.870 --> 37:03.050]  Man, all these guys distracted me from potentially someone dropping something.
[37:03.190 --> 37:04.670]  Yeah, they're so entertaining.
[37:05.430 --> 37:08.010]  Oh, that's a high five. That's one. There's a high five on the board.
[37:08.270 --> 37:08.950]  Oh, man.
[37:09.150 --> 37:10.200]  Uh, I don't have it.
[37:12.470 --> 37:17.450]  This, Geoff, I said it so many times the last time we played, this is so fucking fun.
[37:17.730 --> 37:18.370]  It is the best.
[37:18.370 --> 37:21.190]  I genuinely love this.
[37:21.770 --> 37:22.050]  Me too.
[37:22.390 --> 37:24.770]  I've been looking forward to this all week.
[37:25.270 --> 37:27.870]  I just hope we can keep doing it.
[37:27.870 --> 37:32.050]  I was like pacing around the house for the last 20 minutes waiting to start this.
[37:32.210 --> 37:34.330]  We have to keep doing it.
[37:34.370 --> 37:38.490]  It's just so much fun. I mean, I'm doing it. I'm doing it every Friday and Saturday night already.
[37:40.350 --> 37:43.790]  Also, hey, real quick. Happy birthday, Mike Pirtle.
[37:44.370 --> 37:46.110]  Happy birthday, Mike Pirtle.
[37:46.670 --> 37:47.110]  HB.
[37:48.990 --> 37:49.870]  That's awesome.
[37:50.090 --> 37:51.490]  Jeans and flip-flops again.
[37:51.650 --> 37:53.130]  Well, I don't care. Go to hell.
[37:53.390 --> 37:55.430]  Tonight's the night for jeans and flip-flops.
[37:55.690 --> 37:56.090]  Jesus Christ.
[37:56.090 --> 37:58.050]  I don't care about jeans and flip-flops anymore.
[37:58.810 --> 37:59.870]  I need someone to trip.
[38:00.970 --> 38:03.490]  I need a crosswalk coward, baby.
[38:04.970 --> 38:05.790]  Here's a chance.
[38:06.330 --> 38:06.450]  Nope.
[38:08.350 --> 38:10.590]  There's so much crosswalk confidence tonight.
[38:10.670 --> 38:12.350]  There is. It's big time.
[38:13.170 --> 38:15.190]  People are drunk enough to be pretty confident.
[38:15.230 --> 38:16.110]  Yeah, it's the drinks.
[38:16.290 --> 38:18.170]  Try to get in the wrong car, dude. Try to get in that car.
[38:18.290 --> 38:19.730]  I'll try. I fucking dare you.
[38:21.410 --> 38:22.510]  Do it. You won't.
[38:26.390 --> 38:26.910]  Fuck.
[38:30.610 --> 38:32.750]  That bug not even slowing down.
[38:33.650 --> 38:37.970]  Is this a stop? Is this traffic lights that we can't see?
[38:39.350 --> 38:40.370]  I don't know.
[38:40.390 --> 38:40.750]  Or a stop sign.
[38:41.410 --> 38:42.290]  I don't know.
[38:42.570 --> 38:44.030]  I assume so.
[38:46.390 --> 38:47.410]  I assume so.
[38:47.790 --> 38:50.550]  Oh, I thought she was shy, but she just wanted a better...
[38:50.550 --> 38:52.770]  Oh, she went and found someone to stand there with.
[38:53.070 --> 38:53.350]  Awesome.
[38:53.950 --> 38:55.210]  What if you were shy?
[38:55.810 --> 38:58.790]  What if instead you realized that you're too shy for camera
[38:58.790 --> 38:59.810]  and you fled right now?
[38:59.970 --> 39:02.630]  Yeah, what if you were too shy and then you tried to jump in that truck?
[39:02.850 --> 39:04.510]  And got separated at the crosswalk.
[39:04.750 --> 39:05.050]  Double hug.
[39:05.070 --> 39:06.030]  Look at all these hugs.
[39:06.150 --> 39:06.490]  Triple hug.
[39:06.690 --> 39:07.410]  Oh my God.
[39:07.430 --> 39:08.250]  That's a lot of hugs.
[39:08.290 --> 39:09.070]  It's a hug tree.
[39:10.630 --> 39:11.030]  Hugtacular.
[39:12.550 --> 39:13.370]  Hug a manjaro.
[39:14.190 --> 39:15.750]  That's definitely dance. Real dancing.
[39:16.030 --> 39:17.210]  Dude, hugpocalypse.
[39:20.170 --> 39:22.190]  I like that guy's checkered shirt.
[39:22.190 --> 39:23.350]  It's a nice shirt.
[39:23.410 --> 39:24.790]  It's a hugging frenzy.
[39:27.510 --> 39:29.970]  Those guys are definitely having a hug off back there.
[39:30.990 --> 39:33.270]  Oh, now they're having a dance off.
[39:33.610 --> 39:33.790]  Nice.
[39:34.050 --> 39:35.990]  Limbalad messaged me and he said they're having a great time.
[39:36.110 --> 39:37.570]  They're all watching this and just cracking up.
[39:38.710 --> 39:41.250]  If we got the crew, man, we're doing something right.
[39:42.810 --> 39:43.330]  This is good.
[39:44.450 --> 39:46.430]  Why won't anyone drop anything though?
[39:46.590 --> 39:47.430]  I know.
[39:48.470 --> 39:49.830]  Everyone's got glue fingers.
[39:51.270 --> 39:52.550]  It's true.
[39:53.230 --> 39:54.710]  They won't drop anything.
[39:54.990 --> 39:57.810]  They just keep like being confident in the crosswalk.
[39:57.930 --> 39:58.510]  I hate it.
[40:00.430 --> 40:04.310]  Maybe somebody could drop something and when they went to pick it up, they throw up.
[40:05.570 --> 40:06.690]  That's the dream.
[40:07.490 --> 40:08.830]  Yeah, that's the dream.
[40:10.930 --> 40:12.150]  Whoa, they're still smiling. Whoa.
[40:13.170 --> 40:14.070]  Oh my God.
[40:16.910 --> 40:18.430]  Here's what I don't get.
[40:18.650 --> 40:18.990]  Moves.
[40:20.090 --> 40:21.450]  It's 2023, right?
[40:21.790 --> 40:22.150]  Uh-huh.
[40:22.190 --> 40:23.890]  Oh, those are matching outfits up there.
[40:24.510 --> 40:27.890]  Every once in a while, old people will come by and be so tickled by the camera.
[40:28.190 --> 40:30.330]  You're right, Gavin. Those are matching outfits.
[40:30.450 --> 40:30.930]  Oh yeah, for sure.
[40:31.130 --> 40:31.710]  Yeah, those are matching outfits.
[40:31.730 --> 40:32.810]  They were all dressed the same.
[40:32.990 --> 40:33.950]  See ya. Bye, lady.
[40:34.650 --> 40:37.370]  Yeah, they're still like surprised by the camera and the novelty of it.
[40:37.450 --> 40:41.130]  Yeah, like I get when a Meemaw does it.
[40:41.550 --> 40:45.830]  But like when you're in your 20s to 30s, why are you surprised by a camera?
[40:46.130 --> 40:49.070]  They're everywhere all the time on you.
[40:49.070 --> 40:51.070]  And you live in social media.
[40:51.470 --> 40:54.270]  Like, I can't broadcast for 24 hours a day.
[40:54.710 --> 40:58.530]  There is a camera with a fucking podcast mic above it.
[40:58.670 --> 41:00.310]  Like it's such a rickety setup.
[41:02.150 --> 41:02.930]  God damn.
[41:03.150 --> 41:03.650]  It's the drinks.
[41:03.730 --> 41:08.410]  If you want to see what the mic looks like, go back through the f***face Instagram.
[41:08.870 --> 41:09.790]  I mean, you can just...
[41:09.790 --> 41:09.950]  I'm sorry, hold on.
[41:10.090 --> 41:11.330]  Nick, you got the beep ready?
[41:11.490 --> 41:11.890]  Hold on.
[41:12.250 --> 41:12.630]  I do.
[41:13.210 --> 41:13.930]  Give me a countdown.
[41:14.510 --> 41:15.850]  Oh, f***face Instagram.
[41:16.030 --> 41:16.590]  Yeah, you nailed it.
[41:16.890 --> 41:17.490]  There you go.
[41:19.650 --> 41:21.950]  We got a picture we found of the mic.
[41:22.090 --> 41:23.030]  It's pretty wild.
[41:23.230 --> 41:29.910]  It's just a cardioid XLR microphone that you would see on a stage with no windsock.
[41:30.450 --> 41:35.110]  That's just wrapped around a 2x4, basically.
[41:35.530 --> 41:36.130]  And hanging.
[41:37.110 --> 41:40.070]  That's why on a windy night, he goes...
[41:42.310 --> 41:46.410]  Oh, man.
[41:46.570 --> 41:47.890]  I hope the audience is into this.
[41:47.890 --> 41:51.890]  Leave a comment if you're watching this later and let us know when you got your bingo.
[41:52.930 --> 41:57.270]  Yeah, or at what point you turned off and then abandoned the entire stream.
[41:57.490 --> 41:58.770]  Yeah, let us know if you watched it.
[41:58.930 --> 41:59.710]  We're not coming back.
[41:59.850 --> 42:02.230]  Oh, they're just playing bingo.
[42:02.670 --> 42:04.210]  And you thought it was something else.
[42:04.490 --> 42:07.210]  I love it for the VOD, though, because everyone timecodes in the comments.
[42:07.630 --> 42:09.490]  And you can just skip to everything that happens.
[42:09.650 --> 42:09.970]  It's great.
[42:10.210 --> 42:11.550]  Yeah, timecode when you get your bingo.
[42:12.050 --> 42:13.230]  Yeah, that's good.
[42:13.370 --> 42:14.070]  That's a great idea.
[42:14.070 --> 42:17.570]  Did you guys know that in the first one of these we did, the VOD one that we released...
[42:17.570 --> 42:20.550]  Which, by the way, if you're in the audience and you think this is good, you should watch that one, too.
[42:21.430 --> 42:27.470]  Within the first, like, 30 seconds, a car drives up on the curb in front of all of us and nobody noticed it.
[42:28.770 --> 42:31.530]  The comments were all like, how the fuck are they not paying attention to this?
[42:31.630 --> 42:32.170]  Yeah, it was wild.
[42:32.550 --> 42:34.710]  Is off-road one of the options on the bingo?
[42:34.710 --> 42:37.850]  No, I've never seen it before. We didn't see it then, for Christ's sake.
[42:38.390 --> 42:41.330]  I think the first time we played, we were too overwhelmed.
[42:41.450 --> 42:43.610]  I was very overwhelmed getting going on this one.
[42:43.610 --> 42:46.570]  Yeah, I spent the first three minutes looking down, just trying to memorize everything.
[42:47.070 --> 42:48.610]  Whoa, no shirtless!
[42:49.390 --> 42:49.850]  Oh, shirtless, dude!
[42:50.670 --> 42:54.750]  I don't remember if I added shirtless to the list. It is, it is on. Shirtless is on, I think.
[42:55.370 --> 42:58.370]  We'll have to see if he's covered in bandages, because I feel like he will be.
[43:01.230 --> 43:02.550]  Throw your cigarette on the ground.
[43:03.690 --> 43:04.530]  Oh, they will.
[43:05.390 --> 43:05.670]  Do it.
[43:08.050 --> 43:09.650]  We gotta do this more often, man.
[43:10.510 --> 43:12.250]  Wait, what's that white thing on the street?
[43:13.870 --> 43:15.270]  That looks like trash.
[43:15.850 --> 43:16.790]  It's probably trash.
[43:17.010 --> 43:19.230]  Was that there the whole time? Did somebody drop something? I didn't see it.
[43:20.010 --> 43:22.570]  Are you sure that's not the lime from the guy's drink?
[43:22.690 --> 43:24.270]  It might be the lime from the guy's drink.
[43:24.290 --> 43:27.190]  Oh, the rest of his drink melted and evaporated.
[43:27.190 --> 43:28.290]  Yeah, because it was ice.
[43:30.190 --> 43:34.090]  How have we not seen the ghost tour bus come back? What the fuck?
[43:34.450 --> 43:36.250]  I know, it's Friday night, it's prime ghosting.
[43:36.490 --> 43:38.050]  Yeah, everything's spooky.
[43:38.510 --> 43:39.590]  Uh-oh, they ran into an issue.
[43:39.590 --> 43:42.930]  Yeah, they found ghosts.
[43:43.630 --> 43:51.030]  Okay, I still need wheelchair, go-kart, puking, separated at crosswalk, ghost tour bus, camera shy, and trying to get in...
[43:51.030 --> 43:53.230]  Oh, no, just trying to get into the wrong car.
[43:53.370 --> 43:56.230]  Which hasn't happened tonight, but is really common.
[43:56.570 --> 43:57.190]  That's very funny.
[43:57.570 --> 43:59.810]  Have we had any aggressive honking? I've not really been listening.
[43:59.970 --> 44:01.650]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[44:01.890 --> 44:05.370]  I feel like I've heard honking, but nothing that I would qualify as aggressive.
[44:05.690 --> 44:07.890]  I think it happened before we started.
[44:08.350 --> 44:15.370]  Yeah, I have a few that I feel like I'm close to. Barefoot, I feel like I'm ready to see.
[44:16.050 --> 44:18.070]  Definitely drop something, I'm with Gavin there.
[44:19.750 --> 44:22.790]  Tripping, bandage dude, I'm really excited to see bandage dude.
[44:24.010 --> 44:26.770]  But the rest are just the things that you're ready for, like crosswalk coward.
[44:27.390 --> 44:27.890]  What is it, Nick?
[44:28.650 --> 44:30.790]  Sorry, the light started flashing and I...
[44:30.790 --> 44:31.130]  Oh, okay.
[44:32.090 --> 44:32.790]  She's hoofing it.
[44:33.270 --> 44:34.670]  Yeah, she was definitely hoofing it.
[44:35.030 --> 44:36.770]  Oh, what is gonna get in or out of this car?
[44:36.770 --> 44:38.630]  Come on, come on, wrong one, wrong one.
[44:38.830 --> 44:40.030]  Wrong car, wrong one.
[44:40.050 --> 44:41.350]  Oh, no.
[44:43.490 --> 44:44.310]  Damn it.
[44:47.390 --> 44:48.270]  Damn it.
[44:52.510 --> 44:54.350]  Drive two feet and then let him out.
[44:54.950 --> 44:56.450]  It's not too late to realize the mistake.
[44:58.250 --> 44:59.710]  This is all wrong, get out.
[45:00.270 --> 45:01.690]  You're not bandage guy.
[45:05.110 --> 45:06.430]  He's at the other corner.
[45:07.690 --> 45:11.530]  Dude, look at that guy with his legs kicked back, drinking his water.
[45:11.970 --> 45:13.670]  That homie is chilling.
[45:14.930 --> 45:16.870]  That guy's living the dream.
[45:17.290 --> 45:18.990]  Oh, he just set something down.
[45:20.030 --> 45:21.970]  Did he just put his cigarette down on the ground?
[45:22.430 --> 45:24.070]  He's still smoking his cigarette.
[45:25.050 --> 45:25.410]  Is he?
[45:25.810 --> 45:27.670]  He just touched the ground.
[45:28.670 --> 45:30.670]  Maybe that's what they mean by touch grass.
[45:31.730 --> 45:32.510]  That's what they mean.
[45:32.610 --> 45:33.590]  Who's wearing lanyards?
[45:33.950 --> 45:34.790]  Oh, it's a convention.
[45:35.310 --> 45:36.190]  Definitely a convention.
[45:36.610 --> 45:37.130]  A tall group.
[45:40.270 --> 45:42.290]  I thought you said tall group.
[45:47.450 --> 45:52.750]  I think I said this last time, but it's still true.
[45:53.230 --> 45:58.490]  Everybody on here riding a bicycle, it doesn't look like the first time they've ridden a bicycle, but it does look like the second.
[46:04.000 --> 46:04.440]  Oh!
[46:05.620 --> 46:08.160]  That was the weirdest hoofing I've ever seen.
[46:08.520 --> 46:10.660]  That was an American flag shirt, but we already got it.
[46:11.320 --> 46:13.700]  He's also fucking hammered.
[46:13.840 --> 46:14.960]  Look at that drunk walk.
[46:16.120 --> 46:17.600]  He's got those zombie arms.
[46:18.380 --> 46:19.800]  Just fucking laying dead at his side.
[46:20.600 --> 46:22.920]  These guys in the back are having too much fun partying.
[46:23.220 --> 46:25.460]  That kind of partying can turn into a fight real fast.
[46:28.240 --> 46:30.500]  People are just going into Sloppy Joe's, man.
[46:32.560 --> 46:34.600]  Yeah, they're up until 4am, I think.
[46:35.080 --> 46:35.260]  Insane.
[46:35.860 --> 46:39.640]  I don't know if you ever do, but do you tune in at like 11.30am ever?
[46:40.120 --> 46:40.340]  Yeah.
[46:40.800 --> 46:47.660]  What I do is I leave it on in my living room when I go to bed, and then when I get up in the morning, I can just rewind.
[46:50.880 --> 46:52.000]  That's a new one.
[46:53.100 --> 46:53.800]  Fireman's carry.
[46:54.180 --> 46:54.840]  That's crazy.
[46:55.840 --> 46:56.720]  That's a first.
[46:59.780 --> 47:02.160]  Do you think Emily has a bingo?
[47:03.960 --> 47:04.960]  Let me ask her.
[47:05.120 --> 47:06.420]  She's playing in the bedroom.
[47:06.560 --> 47:07.320]  Of course.
[47:07.820 --> 47:08.900]  Do you have bingo?
[47:11.420 --> 47:13.100]  Is she carrying a dog?
[47:13.260 --> 47:13.960]  What is she carrying?
[47:14.600 --> 47:16.360]  That dog should not be out this late.
[47:16.560 --> 47:17.620]  Oh, no, it's a bag.
[47:17.780 --> 47:18.580]  It's her purse.
[47:19.600 --> 47:20.740]  She's cradling it.
[47:22.360 --> 47:24.620]  Alright, it looks like we have about 10 minutes left.
[47:24.980 --> 47:25.140]  Dang!
[47:25.860 --> 47:29.840]  I have... so everybody count up how many you have. I guess include the free space.
[47:29.940 --> 47:35.800]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. 17.
[47:36.420 --> 47:37.820]  Alright, let's struggle this guy again.
[47:38.040 --> 47:38.600]  I've got 16.
[47:38.600 --> 47:38.960]  I have 16.
[47:39.960 --> 47:40.860]  She said yes.
[47:41.340 --> 47:41.680]  Damn!
[47:41.740 --> 47:41.940]  Okay.
[47:42.600 --> 47:43.920]  Doesn't matter, she doesn't get a cake. I do.
[47:43.980 --> 47:45.560]  She doesn't get a fucking cake, you are.
[47:45.640 --> 47:51.320]  Okay, so maybe you have the... it'll be like F1 where there's the driver's cup and then the constructor's cup.
[47:51.320 --> 47:55.680]  Maybe we have like the winner and then the blackout winner.
[47:55.700 --> 47:57.820]  Yeah, you have like a cupcake.
[47:58.480 --> 48:00.900]  Alright, and then I get... yeah, blackout winner gets a cupcake.
[48:04.080 --> 48:07.060]  I told you, it doesn't matter. Nick is back in.
[48:07.320 --> 48:07.740]  Nick has been reinvigorated.
[48:09.320 --> 48:10.980]  Suddenly there are steaks again.
[48:11.800 --> 48:12.280]  Ooh, steak.
[48:13.460 --> 48:14.020]  This is...
[48:14.020 --> 48:18.300]  We have 9 minutes left before we're gonna have to call it.
[48:18.300 --> 48:20.220]  A.H. Halo Land Party is up next.
[48:20.400 --> 48:22.000]  Oh, that's even better than this. Good for them.
[48:22.300 --> 48:26.340]  If you're watching this on the Face YouTube channel, then...
[48:26.340 --> 48:27.100]  No, it's fine.
[48:27.440 --> 48:30.400]  And it should... thank you, Face YouTube channel.
[48:30.480 --> 48:33.460]  It should kick you over to the Rooster Teeth YouTube channel, hopefully.
[48:34.720 --> 48:35.760]  Or... God, that guy is just bad.
[48:35.760 --> 48:37.200]  Dude, put a fucking shirt on.
[48:37.300 --> 48:38.280]  He's looking for it.
[48:39.200 --> 48:39.500]  Go to the Rooster Teeth.
[48:39.640 --> 48:40.620]  What are you doing?
[48:41.060 --> 48:41.620]  Oh, man.
[48:42.280 --> 48:46.120]  You can't go into any... every place in the world says no shoot, no shows, no service.
[48:46.120 --> 48:49.120]  That guy is just eliminating all opportunity for him.
[48:49.560 --> 48:49.580]  Yep.
[48:50.020 --> 48:50.860]  Those guys are hoofed it.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.740]  And that maybe if you're one of those people who's like a Rooster Teeth fan, but maybe not a f*** Face fan yet,
[48:57.120 --> 49:01.480]  and you just... you just tuned in to like, what the... what is this about?
[49:01.900 --> 49:03.540]  Go listen to our podcast too, maybe.
[49:03.620 --> 49:08.960]  Yeah, if you thought any moment of this was funny at all, the podcast is way better than this.
[49:09.340 --> 49:09.880]  Yeah, I agree.
[49:10.660 --> 49:10.980]  Well...
[49:10.980 --> 49:11.380]  Do you think so?
[49:11.680 --> 49:12.680]  No, not really.
[49:13.720 --> 49:14.840]  Do you not?
[49:16.120 --> 49:16.640]  This is pretty fun.
[49:16.720 --> 49:18.300]  I have a question about the crosswalk coward.
[49:18.600 --> 49:21.200]  If they run for the car, is that cowardly?
[49:21.600 --> 49:23.160]  Does that make them a crosswalk coward?
[49:23.560 --> 49:24.600]  Nah, that makes them brazen.
[49:24.960 --> 49:25.280]  Yeah.
[49:26.520 --> 49:27.800]  They're a crosswalk lion.
[49:28.420 --> 49:28.660]  Yeah.
[49:29.120 --> 49:34.040]  No, like, I feel like crosswalk heroics is the old guy we saw just forcing cars back.
[49:34.840 --> 49:36.920]  The guy that was Gandalf-ing all the cars.
[49:36.960 --> 49:38.960]  Yeah, he says, you will not pass.
[49:41.240 --> 49:42.100]  That guy ruled.
[49:43.200 --> 49:48.440]  Let me see if there's any other housekeeping stuff that we have, so that way I can say that I did it all when they say, did you do it all?
[49:48.720 --> 49:49.380]  Who's they?
[49:49.900 --> 49:50.500]  Go to RTX.
[49:50.920 --> 49:51.200]  Larry.
[49:52.160 --> 49:54.200]  RTX, July 7th through 9th.
[49:55.100 --> 49:55.800]  Don't trip.
[49:56.100 --> 49:56.800]  Don't trip.
[49:56.900 --> 49:58.000]  You got it.
[49:58.060 --> 49:58.320]  Get shy.
[49:59.240 --> 49:59.520]  Get shy.
[49:59.760 --> 50:00.080]  Get shy.
[50:00.360 --> 50:06.400]  Use promo code SNOOZERLOOZE for 10% off badges or $100 off an ultra badge.

[50:12.080 --> 50:12.960]  Whoa, that's crazy.
[50:13.060 --> 50:16.220]  Go to RTXAustin.com for information.
[50:16.580 --> 50:18.480]  Nipple touch! Nipple flicking!
[50:19.120 --> 50:21.000]  That's not... there's trash!
[50:21.280 --> 50:22.760]  We're just saying stuff we see, I guess.
[50:22.980 --> 50:23.660]  Bye, see ya.
[50:25.020 --> 50:27.180]  Well, I mean, the nipple flicking was pretty...
[50:27.180 --> 50:29.360]  Yeah, she flicked that dude's nipple.
[50:29.620 --> 50:32.280]  I can't believe I've seen a nipple flick before a wheelchair.
[50:33.240 --> 50:35.280]  Yeah, yeah, two dude scooters.
[50:35.820 --> 50:37.900]  If this guy sits in the bin, that's a wheelchair, though.
[50:43.740 --> 50:45.020]  Oh man, this is great.
[50:49.540 --> 50:51.820]  I wonder if I'm going to win a cupcake.
[50:52.120 --> 50:53.160]  It'd be pretty fucking nice.
[50:53.540 --> 50:54.820]  I mean, you got one more than me.
[50:55.160 --> 50:55.480]  And me.
[50:57.580 --> 50:59.140]  You have the most right now, I think, right?
[50:59.160 --> 50:59.640]  Do you have 17?
[51:00.480 --> 51:02.080]  Uh, yeah, but man, there's no...
[51:02.080 --> 51:05.000]  I don't think I'm going to see a go-kart or a wheelchair.
[51:05.520 --> 51:07.820]  If a beach goth trips, I'm set.
[51:08.200 --> 51:09.220]  We've seen a beach goth.
[51:09.220 --> 51:10.480]  Yeah, we've seen a beach goth.
[51:10.520 --> 51:11.660]  We've seen a beach...
[51:12.380 --> 51:12.740]  BINGO!
[51:14.260 --> 51:16.400]  I mean, Andrew, we already did that.
[51:16.640 --> 51:18.480]  What do you mean?
[51:18.900 --> 51:20.380]  Does that not count?
[51:20.620 --> 51:22.240]  Yeah, we're playing blackout.
[51:22.320 --> 51:24.560]  We can celebrate our bingos.
[51:24.860 --> 51:25.780]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[51:26.480 --> 51:28.580]  It's just that I won your cake.
[51:29.100 --> 51:30.160]  Oh, drop something from that.
[51:30.720 --> 51:32.340]  One can! Roll out!
[51:32.640 --> 51:34.780]  Drop it, litterbug. Come on.
[51:35.040 --> 51:36.720]  He had a great tie job on that.
[51:37.100 --> 51:42.180]  It's so frustrating how it works, too, because the next time we play, you're going to see people drop shit constantly.
[51:42.180 --> 51:42.660]  Oh, yeah.
[51:42.660 --> 51:45.080]  Dude, the next time I watch this video, I'm going to see it.
[51:49.800 --> 51:52.980]  My favorite part is the audience members that are watching this screaming at all.
[51:52.980 --> 51:53.260]  Oh, yeah.
[51:54.020 --> 51:57.020]  Like, how could you be so stupid?
[52:01.680 --> 52:03.840]  I had a nickel for every time I heard that.
[52:08.820 --> 52:10.400]  Hey, take those dogs home.
[52:10.860 --> 52:11.480]  They're tired.
[52:11.480 --> 52:12.320]  Too late for dogs.
[52:12.360 --> 52:12.760]  They're tired.
[52:12.840 --> 52:15.080]  They don't want to be walking around this hard-ass street at night.
[52:15.120 --> 52:16.160]  They got paws.
[52:19.560 --> 52:19.920]  Goddamn.
[52:20.080 --> 52:22.000]  Dude, let's have fully loaded convertibles.
[52:22.180 --> 52:22.800]  Yeah, no kidding.
[52:22.880 --> 52:24.240]  I don't know why everyone...
[52:24.240 --> 52:25.040]  Is that FaceTime?
[52:26.380 --> 52:27.880]  No, it's just Instagram.
[52:28.620 --> 52:29.860]  We got FaceTime earlier.
[52:30.060 --> 52:30.600]  Might be Instagram.
[52:30.780 --> 52:31.500]  We did?
[52:31.760 --> 52:32.460]  I did.
[52:33.640 --> 52:33.820]  Bingo.
[52:33.820 --> 52:34.820]  Is that not the one at the top?
[52:35.080 --> 52:36.240]  Oh, there you go, buddy.
[52:36.520 --> 52:36.860]  Good job, man.
[52:36.860 --> 52:38.100]  I'm at 17 now, too.
[52:39.860 --> 52:40.580]  Oh, cupcake.
[52:41.160 --> 52:44.260]  I have a cover band thing, so I'm never going to clear my cart.
[52:44.400 --> 52:46.200]  Yeah, have you got a cover band playing Green Day?
[52:46.840 --> 52:49.800]  You know, I might have to pull... we might pull the cover band out.
[52:50.060 --> 52:51.680]  Because they also had to remove the camera.
[52:52.580 --> 52:53.680]  That's a real niche one.
[52:54.060 --> 52:54.320]  Yeah.
[52:54.680 --> 52:58.460]  It just used to be, like, every five minutes they were playing Green Day.
[53:01.420 --> 53:02.060]  Come on, crosswalk.
[53:02.100 --> 53:02.340]  Nope.
[53:02.760 --> 53:03.880]  Oh, he was confident.
[53:04.260 --> 53:05.000]  What a stride.
[53:05.480 --> 53:06.340]  Zero pause.
[53:07.040 --> 53:07.920]  That dude doesn't fuck around.
[53:08.100 --> 53:08.660]  No fear.
[53:09.140 --> 53:09.920]  Oh, what's on the shirt?
[53:09.920 --> 53:11.400]  No one barefoot.
[53:11.560 --> 53:12.540]  Can't believe it.
[53:13.120 --> 53:15.000]  Yeah, some lady will take her shoes off.
[53:15.380 --> 53:16.540]  Boats and hoes.
[53:19.460 --> 53:22.220]  I mean, these aren't matching outfits, but they almost are.
[53:22.580 --> 53:25.340]  That dude on the left is a little toasty.
[53:25.580 --> 53:26.140]  He's having fun.
[53:26.260 --> 53:26.800]  He's having fun.
[53:27.180 --> 53:29.800]  I can't believe no one tripped all night.
[53:29.860 --> 53:31.360]  That's what Key West is all about.
[53:31.980 --> 53:33.240]  Oh, double fisting.
[53:35.740 --> 53:37.460]  Once you see it once, you keep seeing it.
[53:37.960 --> 53:38.220]  Yeah.
[53:42.340 --> 53:47.580]  You know, we've been, Eric, we've been going through the Stern catalog, Emily and I, and showing it to her.
[53:47.620 --> 53:48.660]  The bucket hat's stupid.
[53:51.500 --> 53:54.160]  Socks and sandals should be something, because that's fucking dumb, too.
[53:54.980 --> 54:01.580]  And we've got her... I just explained, just showed Emily, the Scores Man is about partying and having fun.
[54:02.360 --> 54:03.240]  Oh, hell yeah.
[54:03.380 --> 54:05.120]  That's become, like, the phrase around the house.
[54:05.380 --> 54:08.260]  What does he say? I'm about meeting guys. I'm about meeting girls.
[54:08.480 --> 54:09.520]  I'm about meeting girls. I'm about meeting guys.
[54:11.180 --> 54:12.240]  The Scores Man.
[54:12.660 --> 54:14.340]  The best. The best.
[54:15.120 --> 54:17.440]  We only have a few minutes left.
[54:17.880 --> 54:19.560]  Is there anything we want to plug out?
[54:19.800 --> 54:22.100]  You gotta listen to the regular podcast.
[54:22.440 --> 54:24.520]  We have 150 something episodes of...
[54:25.900 --> 54:28.720]  I mean, we're in our nickname era right now, I would say.
[54:29.100 --> 54:31.680]  We did two episodes yesterday, and one of them was weird.
[54:32.340 --> 54:34.780]  Yeah, I was about to say, can we plug... what did we do yesterday?
[54:34.920 --> 54:37.340]  We did 158 and 159?
[54:37.560 --> 54:37.720]  Yeah.
[54:37.720 --> 54:41.960]  Man, 159 is fucking out there.
[54:42.940 --> 54:47.440]  I mean, I don't want to give anything away, but, I mean, we learn a lot about Snoopy.
[54:48.220 --> 54:49.380]  God damn, dude.
[54:49.860 --> 54:50.540]  That's what happens.
[54:51.640 --> 54:51.840]  Yeah.
[54:55.320 --> 54:57.400]  Okay. Yeah, it's weird.
[54:57.860 --> 54:59.600]  And about what people wear in Canada.
[55:01.780 --> 55:03.860]  To me, that's what started it.
[55:03.860 --> 55:05.180]  That is what started it.
[55:05.320 --> 55:10.360]  It's the worst question, and it's just like, is this a topic of conversation?
[55:10.700 --> 55:11.860]  Well, there's a worst question.
[55:11.880 --> 55:13.540]  But apparently not the worst question.
[55:15.920 --> 55:19.260]  But yeah, that moment was the iceberg to that episode.
[55:22.660 --> 55:24.060]  We were just the Titanic.
[55:24.840 --> 55:27.080]  It was so fucked.
[55:28.900 --> 55:30.960]  This has been a lot of fun.
[55:31.360 --> 55:32.860]  Yeah, it has been a lot of fun.
[55:32.860 --> 55:35.200]  I can't wait to eat a whole cake. I'm very thrilled.
[55:35.320 --> 55:36.680]  Two guys on a scooter again, I think.
[55:37.320 --> 55:39.160]  Can you eat that whole cake in one sitting?
[55:39.500 --> 55:40.900]  No, no, no, no, no.
[55:40.920 --> 55:41.980]  That'd be fun to try, though.
[55:42.200 --> 55:43.440]  I would love to try.
[55:43.660 --> 55:45.260]  That's a dead parrot head right there.
[55:45.260 --> 55:48.140]  And he's got steel hat.
[55:48.520 --> 55:49.980]  That's a golden snitch, man.
[55:50.560 --> 55:52.240]  That's a late game nothing, though.
[55:52.340 --> 55:53.580]  That's like an empty snitch.
[55:54.400 --> 55:56.380]  Yeah, we got all that shit.
[55:57.780 --> 55:59.120]  Anything else we want to plug?
[55:59.320 --> 56:04.860]  Anything else we want to say before we kick it over to the A.H. Halo playing?
[56:06.800 --> 56:07.000]  No.
[56:07.900 --> 56:08.860]  Thank you.
[56:11.840 --> 56:15.000]  Welcome to Rooster Teeth, where we have the gift of gab.
[56:15.460 --> 56:16.760]  Thank you so much.
[56:17.240 --> 56:18.040]  Hey, you know what?
[56:18.140 --> 56:19.180]  I got something for you.
[56:20.620 --> 56:22.220]  What was the guy's name?
[56:22.300 --> 56:23.640]  Gherky T that made this?
[56:23.640 --> 56:24.220]  What?
[56:26.260 --> 56:27.020]  Gooby Con?
[56:27.900 --> 56:29.180]  I'm sorry, hang on.
[56:29.380 --> 56:30.740]  He made this thing.
[56:31.140 --> 56:33.480]  We're like, oh, this is going to be the official thing.
[56:33.520 --> 56:35.280]  He is so excited. He's a big fan.
[56:35.520 --> 56:37.240]  And you said, what's his name?
[56:37.660 --> 56:38.500]  Gherky T?
[56:38.860 --> 56:40.680]  I was close. Gooby Con.
[56:41.100 --> 56:42.820]  No, Geoff was just giving him his nickname.
[56:44.600 --> 56:45.760]  Gherky T, congratulations.
[56:47.000 --> 56:47.580]  Nickname era.
[56:47.760 --> 56:48.920]  You've been christened.
[56:48.960 --> 56:49.780]  Yeah, you're in the nickname era.
[56:49.780 --> 56:51.980]  You didn't pick your nickname.
[56:52.100 --> 56:53.280]  Much like Gooch Pooch.
[56:53.580 --> 56:54.720]  You didn't pick your nickname.
[56:54.880 --> 56:57.740]  Please don't call Eric Gooch Pooch.
[56:58.020 --> 56:59.820]  Or the Gooch, or the Goocher.
[57:00.020 --> 57:01.120]  Or Gooch Dog.
[57:01.940 --> 57:03.580]  Just call him Big Dog.
[57:04.280 --> 57:06.060]  I've blocked and unblocked
[57:06.060 --> 57:07.980]  so many people in the last few days.
[57:08.200 --> 57:09.220]  My point being,
[57:09.720 --> 57:12.020]  now that
[57:12.020 --> 57:14.120]  Gherky T has released this into the world,
[57:15.160 --> 57:16.160]  you can play this
[57:16.160 --> 57:16.840]  whenever you want.
[57:17.360 --> 57:18.140]  Bookmark the
[57:18.960 --> 57:21.200]  bingo generator and feel free to play along.
[57:21.320 --> 57:22.320]  You can play it in the daytime.
[57:22.480 --> 57:24.340]  I've played it in the daytime. It's not as entertaining,
[57:24.500 --> 57:26.360]  but it's still playable and it is still fun.
[57:27.020 --> 57:28.600]  I think he's dancing his little dick off.
[57:28.680 --> 57:29.660]  Just so you guys know,
[57:29.880 --> 57:32.620]  I just got a message that a computer froze
[57:32.620 --> 57:34.680]  and they asked us to vamp for another five minutes.
[57:34.860 --> 57:35.800]  Not a problem.
[57:37.700 --> 57:39.160]  Dancing his ass off.
[57:39.440 --> 57:40.420]  Hey, Andrew?
[57:40.920 --> 57:41.300]  Yes?
[57:41.500 --> 57:44.100]  What the fuck did you post in the Slack channel?
[57:44.100 --> 57:45.860]  So, I posted
[57:45.860 --> 57:47.740]  in case I won,
[57:47.960 --> 57:50.000]  I wanted to show what my bingo card was
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.220]  ahead of time, so I posted it, but then I lost
[57:52.220 --> 57:54.060]  my card, so then I had to
[57:55.360 --> 57:56.240]  post it in
[57:56.240 --> 57:57.720]  Messenger to make adjustments
[57:57.720 --> 57:58.640]  to it.
[57:58.900 --> 58:01.580]  It is fucked.
[58:02.200 --> 58:03.220]  It's so bad.
[58:03.460 --> 58:04.420]  It's so fucked.
[58:05.580 --> 58:07.880]  You can't tell if he got anything or not.
[58:08.180 --> 58:09.740]  The thing about what Gherky T made
[58:09.740 --> 58:12.100]  on the site is that you can just tap on it.
[58:12.100 --> 58:13.580]  It's great.
[58:15.200 --> 58:15.980]  The problem is
[58:15.980 --> 58:16.820]  I really like my card.
[58:17.020 --> 58:18.880]  G-U-V-K-O-N on Twitter.
[58:19.800 --> 58:20.760]  Yeah, GoovyCon.
[58:21.060 --> 58:23.280]  Yeah, just knows.
[58:23.760 --> 58:25.200]  His nickname is Gherky T.
[58:25.500 --> 58:27.860]  Gherky T. Oh, man.
[58:29.020 --> 58:29.560]  Nickname error.
[58:29.600 --> 58:32.160]  Dude, do you know how many people have an official f*** face nickname?
[58:32.340 --> 58:33.100]  Oh, hold on a second.
[58:33.520 --> 58:34.480]  Nick, are you here with the button?
[58:35.440 --> 58:36.240]  Ready, set.
[58:36.860 --> 58:38.840]  Do you know how many people have an official...
[58:40.580 --> 58:41.780]  It's so bad.
[58:42.060 --> 58:43.140]  It is every time.
[58:43.180 --> 58:43.620]  I know.
[58:44.940 --> 58:46.280]  Not that many.
[58:46.520 --> 58:51.000]  Do you know how many people have an official f*** face nickname?
[58:52.680 --> 58:54.960]  Nickname? Us and Gherky T.
[58:55.100 --> 58:55.560]  That's it.
[58:56.760 --> 58:57.640]  Oh, man.
[58:58.580 --> 58:59.640]  Gherky T.
[59:00.320 --> 59:02.980]  I think GoovyCon is way better than Gherky T.
[59:03.140 --> 59:03.960]  Oh, absolutely.
[59:04.920 --> 59:07.020]  I'm sure Eric thinks Eric is better
[59:07.020 --> 59:09.300]  than f***ing GoochBooch, but he's still GoochBooch.
[59:09.400 --> 59:10.600]  Not really, though.
[59:10.680 --> 59:11.640]  Call him BigDog.
[59:13.120 --> 59:14.100]  GoochBooch rules, though.
[59:16.180 --> 59:17.540]  Is that a dumb hat?
[59:17.980 --> 59:19.120]  Or is that just a headband?
[59:19.480 --> 59:20.580]  Can a headband be a dumb hat?
[59:20.980 --> 59:21.900]  I don't know.
[59:22.300 --> 59:23.520]  I don't think a headband is a hat.
[59:24.640 --> 59:26.420]  Is that guy on the scooter barefoot?
[59:26.480 --> 59:26.960]  I can't tell.
[59:28.500 --> 59:30.220]  I think I just want it too bad.
[59:30.400 --> 59:31.560]  I mean, he just doesn't have a shirt on.
[59:31.940 --> 59:32.920]  He's wearing boots.
[59:33.720 --> 59:34.160]  Damn.
[59:34.540 --> 59:35.540]  No, he's not.
[59:36.580 --> 59:38.660]  I'm definitely getting confirmation that the bleeps
[59:38.660 --> 59:39.880]  are not being heard by the audience.
[59:41.860 --> 59:42.640]  Don't worry.
[59:42.800 --> 59:43.900]  That's just for the live feed.
[59:44.160 --> 59:47.500]  In the VOD you watch later,
[59:47.600 --> 59:48.380]  they'll be there, I'm sure.
[59:48.600 --> 59:50.540]  Yeah, the bleeps will be everywhere for no reason.
[59:51.460 --> 59:52.160]  Oh, my God.
[59:52.280 --> 59:54.420]  You'll hear how f***ing terrible those bleeps were.
[59:54.580 --> 59:55.500]  So funny.
[59:55.720 --> 59:56.780]  It's so funny.
[59:57.820 --> 59:58.620]  It's the best.
[59:58.620 --> 59:59.400]  Ugh.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.620]  Again, we're just vamping until the computer
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.560]  comes back, but this is...
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.620]  Oh! I thought she was going to
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:07.940]  see the camera. Never mind.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:10.000]  I thought she was going to see the camera and then get shy.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.540]  That's what I thought was going to happen.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:12.960]  Trip, trip, trip, trip.
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:14.980]  Somebody lit her.
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.060]  I'm getting separated at the crosswalk.
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.580]  Zero cowardly.
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.420]  That car was fast.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.760]  Some people aren't safe.
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:24.960]  Oh, yeah?
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.880]  We're watching
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.480]  this.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.580]  From the safe
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.040]  to our own homes.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.940]  Oh, that's
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:35.420]  so funny.
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:37.480]  Skateboard! Skateboard!
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:38.000]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:42.960]  Ah, f***. Are you serious, Nick?
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:43.780]  Cupcake?
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.160]  That gives you 18.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.720]  Just in time.
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.740]  That guy's got a Let's Go Brandon shirt on.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:53.320]  That's cool.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.240]  Was he double fisting phones?
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.820]  One for work, one for pleasure.
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:06.360]  Oh, look at that.
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:09.500]  What the hell is going on in that SUV back there?
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.520]  Maybe ugly decals should be
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:12.280]  on the wall.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.320]  They seem to be cropping up a lot tonight.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.340]  It's interesting to see the trends.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.800]  What's hot in Key West right now?
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.600]  Ground effects on cars and ugly...
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.320]  I like that it causes our game of bingo
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.540]  to be ever-evolving.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.880]  Ever-evolving?
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.220]  Oh, my God.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.140]  That guy's got a
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:35.220]  Burberry shirt on.
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.840]  It just says it.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.420]  Dogs! Dogs.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.780]  Come on, man. Those dogs are tired.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.480]  Look how late it is.
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:45.200]  Who's that for?
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.300]  That's not for the dogs. That's for you.
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.500]  And guess what? Nobody cares that you have dogs.
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.540]  Yeah, in fact, we're mad at you.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.920]  That's not something to brag about.
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.000]  Can I ask the chat? Did anyone in chat see a mullet tonight?
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:56.840]  Let me know.
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:58.760]  Thanks for your help.
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.620]  I heard that people are debating
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.620]  on if they're comment leavers if they were in the chat.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.740]  I don't know, like, what kind of world
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:07.460]  are you living in where you think you're not?
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.120]  Well, only if you typed in the chat.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200]  If you're reading the chat, you don't.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.380]  Well, I mean, if they're asking the question, they type in the chat.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.200]  Hey, am I a comment leaver? Hey, are you fucking kidding?
[01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:19.270]  Like,
[01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:20.530]  come on.
[01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:23.390]  Well, her pants are two different
[01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:24.250]  kinds of pants.
[01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:26.730]  Oh, dude, we missed multiple mullets, apparently.
[01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:27.730]  Really?
[01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:29.970]  Yeah, but you don't know that.
[01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:32.790]  Sometimes people think
[01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:34.590]  we'll call long hair a mullet.
[01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:37.330]  Gavin, are you going to trust the audience?
[01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:38.530]  I think I do.
[01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:39.790]  I think I do on the mullet front.
[01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:41.830]  Because a mullet...
[01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:42.770]  Well...
[01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:47.330]  To not see a crosswalk coward
[01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:50.150]  is truly like a dagger in my heart.
[01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:51.370]  Yeah. Thanks, chat.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.200]  Man.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.060]  I'm really amazed
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.320]  we didn't see the ghost tour bus.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.900]  What happened?
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:04.560]  Like, I guarantee you
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.360]  this street is on the
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.340]  part of the tour and it runs till midnight
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:08.880]  probably.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.320]  Man.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.720]  Maybe inflation
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.880]  has killed the ghost hunting market.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.480]  Maybe people just
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.240]  aren't doing tours of dead people.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.600]  But they are! We saw it earlier
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600]  before we started.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.420]  Maybe they have to cut it short. Maybe they can't
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:25.900]  fill enough.
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:29.340]  I don't know. I'm just trying to make excuses for where they are.
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.500]  For the ghost tour.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:34.840]  I don't like that that lady's pants are two different colors.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.000]  Oh, wow.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:37.520]  Very weird.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.360]  Not a fan.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.620]  Well, that lady came out of the fucking bar fast.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.120]  Jesus Christ.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.100]  I've never seen any...
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:47.080]  Oh, they're not well.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.500]  They're fine.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.160]  That's not a good sign.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.280]  I was about to say, I've never seen anybody
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.520]  hoof it and still be walking, but she definitely...
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.220]  Pointing is fine,
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.540]  but when someone's walking towards you fast
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:02.700]  and pointing, it's never good.
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.680]  That's a bad combo.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.100]  That's a bad combo.
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.680]  Crosswalk coward. Come on, get...
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:09.780]  Get nervous.
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:11.220]  Fall.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.880]  A dude accepted his fate.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.800]  That looks like a luxury car.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.200]  Yeah, that is.
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.340]  Something I would take if I was playing GTA.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.060]  I'd go for that.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:30.180]  Budapest.
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:30.960]  What?
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.560]  She looks hungry, I guess.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:35.520]  Gavin and I
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.640]  have been to Budapest together. Lovely city.
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:38.200]  Oh, yeah?
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.460]  Did you get a shirt
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:43.280]  that says Buda-fucking-pest?
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.240]  They give them out at the airport.
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.040]  We saw a little statue of Columba.
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:48.840]  They don't
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.700]  give them out at the airport, but when you do get to the airport,
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.780]  they tell you to follow the colored line
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.560]  on the ground and not to step off it
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.660]  or you may be robbed.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:57.840]  Whoa!
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:04:59.620]  Do you remember that, Gavin?
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:00.500]  No.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.380]  They were like,
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.360]  there was a green line, follow it out to the cab,
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:07.400]  don't get off of it, and don't talk to anybody else.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.600]  They're just trying to rob you.
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.640]  I'm just picturing a shielded line.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:15.820]  It was wild.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.360]  That's crazy.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.820]  There's people hugging in the street
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:20.560]  at the top right.
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:22.280]  Yeah, do it in the corner, man.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.380]  That's so unsafe.
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:27.420]  I will also say that I'm very surprised
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:28.140]  that no
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.900]  bleep face fans came and
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:31.820]  checked it out.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:35.040]  They were too busy at home playing.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:36.840]  Hey Geoff,
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:40.520]  I think we're ready
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.960]  to kick it on over.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:42.860]  I think we're good now.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.320]  Anything you want to say to wrap up?
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.380]  Yeah, let's just do our final counts here.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.320]  I have 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.300]  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.720]  17 is my final score.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:54.680]  13 for me.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:56.860]  Alright,
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.920]  Eric wins the cake.
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.920]  I believe you're getting
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:01.640]  cookie puss.
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:04.500]  Nick, you get a cupcake of your choice.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.880]  Eric, congratulations
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.680]  on winning. The ultimate reward is
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.160]  that you now have to buy your own cake.
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.680]  Because you are
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.380]  the producer, so go ahead and produce yourself
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:15.240]  a cake.
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:18.660]  And if you
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.900]  liked Sloppy Joe Bingo
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:22.660]  on a Friday night, let us know.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:24.380]  Oh, those people are having pizza.
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:25.240]  Drop a slice.
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.500]  I was thinking of it so hard.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.640]  I wanted to see it so bad.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.500]  You know that's some greasy-filled
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.060]  flimsy paper plates there.
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.580]  I just learned that I definitely
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.240]  don't have telekinesis.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.180]  Anyway, if you enjoyed
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:44.300]  this, maybe go ahead and give
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.660]  Face a shot.
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.920]  We've got 159 episodes.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:52.640]  We've got 159 episodes.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:53.500]  159.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.900]  And if you liked Sloppy Joe Bingo, let us know
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:00.540]  and we will play it again.
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.880]  Also, go ahead and check out those kids from Achievement Hunter.
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.960]  I hear they're trying Halo for the first time.
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.600]  And come to RTXAustin.com.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:08.620]  July 7th through 9th.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:09.360]  Come see the museum.
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.420]  Love you, bye!
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:12.440]  Bye!
