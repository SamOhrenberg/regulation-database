[00:16.760 --> 00:20.240]  Hello and welcome to another episode of Face Break Shit.
[00:21.420 --> 00:23.860]  It's December, we didn't do one in November. No. Why not?
[00:23.860 --> 00:26.740]  Through no fault of our own, it was just busy. Yeah.
[00:26.840 --> 00:28.600]  It was hard to get studio time. Yes.
[00:29.920 --> 00:33.820]  Quick order of business, I am Geoff Ramsey, your fearless captain.
[00:34.280 --> 00:36.800]  With me as always is Eric, our producer. Hello.
[00:37.280 --> 00:39.100]  Andrew from Canada. Hello.
[00:39.760 --> 00:43.060]  And then interesting, last time Emily was here playing with some Barbies
[00:43.060 --> 00:45.000]  and Gavin, of course, is always here.
[00:45.980 --> 00:46.660]  Begrudgingly, but here.
[00:47.760 --> 00:48.160]  And...
[00:48.580 --> 00:50.300]  You just can't...
[00:50.300 --> 00:53.000]  You won the day you were born, you're fine.
[00:55.600 --> 00:56.620]  Congratulations, man.
[00:58.520 --> 01:00.280]  Anyway, Gavin has been...
[01:00.280 --> 01:03.460]  Just an order of some office clean up here.
[01:03.540 --> 01:03.980]  Right, right, right.
[01:04.200 --> 01:05.820]  Eric and I had a meeting a little earlier.
[01:06.680 --> 01:09.520]  Just got some administrative notes.
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.880]  Gavin, who has dutifully, if not mediocrely,
[01:15.160 --> 01:17.780]  filled in our role as soundboard operator,
[01:17.980 --> 01:22.640]  has been promoted to not having that responsibility anymore.
[01:23.440 --> 01:27.880]  Gavin's now promoted to just not touching that.
[01:28.220 --> 01:31.380]  And Emily, who was far better at it, has been promoted into doing it.
[01:31.420 --> 01:31.780]  Wow.
[01:32.160 --> 01:32.720]  Congratulations.
[01:33.680 --> 01:35.180]  Whenever you're available, obviously, sweetheart.
[01:35.240 --> 01:36.500]  Andrew, immediate thoughts?
[01:37.540 --> 01:40.960]  It sounds like Gavin's been demoted and not so much promoted,
[01:41.080 --> 01:42.820]  but you're just saying he was promoted.
[01:43.000 --> 01:43.920]  Oh, I see what he's done.
[01:44.120 --> 01:46.220]  He's spun it in a way to trick me.
[01:48.380 --> 01:49.180]  I'll take the demotion.
[01:49.180 --> 01:51.560]  Appreciate that Canadian optimism there, buddy.
[01:53.340 --> 01:55.160]  Okay, also, interestingly, you know,
[01:55.420 --> 01:58.480]  we always say that we don't want to main...
[01:58.480 --> 02:00.220]  like, to create main site bits,
[02:00.320 --> 02:01.200]  like fuckface bits,
[02:01.800 --> 02:02.600]  f***face bits...
[02:02.600 --> 02:02.860]  Thank you.
[02:02.900 --> 02:03.980]  ...on the sideshow.
[02:04.320 --> 02:06.480]  But I will say, since this didn't happen technically on camera,
[02:06.480 --> 02:07.340]  we can talk about it.
[02:07.340 --> 02:11.120]  You guys just invented the official f***ing sound earlier.
[02:11.760 --> 02:12.680]  You guys wanted...
[02:12.680 --> 02:14.440]  This is a product we're going to have to sell now.
[02:14.780 --> 02:15.480]  We didn't invent...
[02:15.480 --> 02:16.240]  This was...
[02:16.240 --> 02:17.400]  When did this thing come out?
[02:17.780 --> 02:18.920]  I've never seen it until this just came out.
[02:18.920 --> 02:20.480]  When we were children...
[02:21.060 --> 02:22.080]  Is there a chat for this?
[02:22.120 --> 02:22.920]  Is there a live chat somewhere?
[02:24.300 --> 02:24.920]  We'll have to...
[02:24.920 --> 02:25.720]  We'll see if we can call it up.
[02:25.740 --> 02:26.140]  We have nothing.
[02:26.380 --> 02:27.380]  But in the chat,
[02:28.660 --> 02:31.140]  we should have them come up with what that is called.
[02:31.180 --> 02:31.340]  Yeah.
[02:31.380 --> 02:32.420]  Because we didn't know what it was called.
[02:32.460 --> 02:32.720]  Right.
[02:32.840 --> 02:34.120]  It's the stick...
[02:34.120 --> 02:34.300]  Yeah.
[02:34.300 --> 02:36.740]  That when you turn it, it goes...
[02:45.140 --> 02:46.860]  Look for that in 2022.
[02:47.360 --> 02:49.660]  We're going to put our f***ing logo on that thing,
[02:49.720 --> 02:51.100]  and we're going to sell two of them.
[02:53.260 --> 02:55.060]  Eric was like, totally.
[02:55.660 --> 02:56.560]  Oh, he nailed it.
[02:56.700 --> 02:57.920]  Geoff was like, huh?
[02:58.160 --> 03:01.220]  So we think potentially it is technology newer than Geoff.
[03:01.320 --> 03:03.740]  Yeah, it couldn't have existed in the early 80s.
[03:03.740 --> 03:04.680]  I have to get some chat.
[03:04.800 --> 03:05.500]  Early to mid 80s.
[03:05.820 --> 03:06.240]  I got it.
[03:06.300 --> 03:07.240]  I got it pulled up here.
[03:08.100 --> 03:08.900]  I want...
[03:08.900 --> 03:11.720]  I want to know...
[03:13.700 --> 03:15.140]  It was very good.
[03:15.240 --> 03:16.080]  Because we didn't know what to search for.
[03:16.080 --> 03:17.400]  New sound just dropped.
[03:20.960 --> 03:24.400]  Can we get a button next year that just...
[03:24.400 --> 03:27.960]  I think we just have to get those sticks.
[03:28.000 --> 03:28.520]  That's right.
[03:28.760 --> 03:30.020]  I mean, it's...
[03:30.020 --> 03:31.220]  I think that's fine.
[03:31.740 --> 03:33.240]  I mean, it's...
[03:33.240 --> 03:34.600]  Emily, is there a name for those sticks?
[03:35.060 --> 03:35.620]  Are we off?
[03:35.760 --> 03:36.380]  I don't know.
[03:38.900 --> 03:40.080]  No, I'm watching it.
[03:40.120 --> 03:40.720]  See, here's Geoff.
[03:41.120 --> 03:41.820]  See, it's good.
[03:41.920 --> 03:42.280]  Oh, okay.
[03:42.680 --> 03:44.300]  I can't get the...
[03:46.200 --> 03:47.160]  Mine doesn't work.
[03:48.680 --> 03:51.580]  People said it's a groke, and then somebody else said it's a groan.
[03:51.740 --> 03:53.500]  So now I need to know if it's a groke or a groan.
[03:53.780 --> 03:55.980]  If it's called a groan stick...
[03:55.980 --> 03:57.100]  Oh, that's pretty...
[03:57.100 --> 04:00.700]  If we could sell a f***ing face groan stick, branded.
[04:00.700 --> 04:03.020]  I don't like it called a groan...
[04:03.020 --> 04:03.820]  I don't like...
[04:03.820 --> 04:07.540]  That's like if you're going like, oh, we have a moan stick.
[04:07.700 --> 04:09.000]  Yeah, it's like...
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.540]  A groan stick sounds to me like an old man jizzing or pooping.
[04:13.600 --> 04:15.180]  Oh, it says it's a groan tube.
[04:18.700 --> 04:20.920]  That is so gross, it's great.
[04:21.220 --> 04:22.120]  Groan tube.
[04:22.460 --> 04:23.680]  A groan tube.
[04:24.320 --> 04:26.780]  Anyway, look out for groan tubes in 2022.
[04:27.240 --> 04:29.020]  They're going to be all over the place.
[04:29.080 --> 04:30.280]  It's the new hotness.
[04:30.280 --> 04:30.960]  It's going to be...
[04:31.400 --> 04:31.960]  Everybody's going to have one.
[04:32.540 --> 04:33.860]  It's a new fidget spinner.
[04:34.420 --> 04:34.900]  That's what it is.
[04:34.960 --> 04:36.000]  It's a 2022 fidget spinner.
[04:36.300 --> 04:37.220]  The groan tube.
[04:37.520 --> 04:38.120]  Groan tube.
[04:38.360 --> 04:38.920]  Oh, man.
[04:39.180 --> 04:40.080]  Andrew, did you have one?
[04:40.740 --> 04:41.720]  I didn't have one.
[04:41.760 --> 04:42.520]  I know what you're talking about.
[04:42.620 --> 04:44.940]  I'd like to imagine there were two people that made it.
[04:45.180 --> 04:47.320]  One person made all the tack and then someone else named it.
[04:47.380 --> 04:49.280]  Imagine how disappointed you would be.
[04:49.680 --> 04:52.820]  You made such a great product, and then you learned it was called the groan tube.
[04:54.960 --> 04:56.420]  It's probably ruining your invention.
[04:56.860 --> 04:57.800]  Here's the sound.
[04:59.220 --> 05:00.120]  Oh, wait. Hold on.
[05:01.500 --> 05:02.800]  I'm not. I'm just...
[05:08.640 --> 05:08.940]  Okay.
[05:09.120 --> 05:10.260]  This sounds like Pac-Man's voice.
[05:10.440 --> 05:14.240]  By the next break shit, we need to have that sound recorded and put into the sound board.
[05:14.240 --> 05:15.440]  Yeah, we have to get the sound.
[05:18.820 --> 05:22.340]  I'd like to propose a scenario for you, Gavin, that I came up with just now.
[05:23.220 --> 05:23.700]  How much?
[05:23.700 --> 05:25.680]  Are you going to tell me to put a groan tube up my ass?
[05:26.360 --> 05:27.140]  Let me finish this.
[05:27.140 --> 05:27.540]  Go ahead.
[05:27.740 --> 05:31.280]  How much for us to get a giant wheel, like the wheel of Zimmer here,
[05:31.740 --> 05:35.000]  that we strap you to, like the wheel that people get knives thrown at them,
[05:35.360 --> 05:38.320]  and then we stick the groan tube in you, up your butt,
[05:38.460 --> 05:40.560]  and then we turn it, and...
[05:42.260 --> 05:43.660]  I think we wouldn't...
[05:43.660 --> 05:47.600]  I mean, if we put something in Gavin, I think he will become the groan tube.
[05:49.080 --> 05:51.360]  I think he will be spinning in a circle going,
[05:52.080 --> 05:54.000]  We should see, we should see.
[05:54.100 --> 05:57.320]  We'll put the groan tube up you, and then put a camera in your throat,
[05:57.420 --> 06:00.100]  and see if you can hear it through your body.
[06:01.900 --> 06:03.600]  Anyway, think about how much you want.
[06:03.600 --> 06:04.720]  Yeah, let me think about that, yeah.
[06:06.500 --> 06:11.240]  Also, this is the show where we, once a month break,
[06:11.720 --> 06:16.260]  open up baseball cards, and non-baseball cards, and non-sports cards, and sports cards alike,
[06:16.340 --> 06:19.360]  and then make fun of them, and I covet them as my treasure.
[06:19.360 --> 06:21.560]  We'll be doing it more frequently in the new year.
[06:21.740 --> 06:21.920]  Yes.
[06:22.060 --> 06:25.680]  We'll have a space, and a time, and all these things, so it's not just like this,
[06:25.820 --> 06:27.120]  like, sort of, okay, we gotta put this together.
[06:27.520 --> 06:31.060]  We'll have, hopefully, some actual space that we can do this, and do this a little more frequently.
[06:31.260 --> 06:32.760]  Good question in the chat, though.
[06:32.840 --> 06:33.100]  What's that?
[06:33.320 --> 06:34.560]  Little Old Bear says,
[06:35.240 --> 06:36.720]  What are we in chat?
[06:38.400 --> 06:39.980]  Regulation chatters, chat leavers?
[06:40.320 --> 06:41.680]  We haven't really discussed what are live...
[06:41.680 --> 06:42.260]  Groan tubers.
[06:42.480 --> 06:44.360]  No, what do you mean? They're comment leavers.
[06:44.640 --> 06:46.820]  You're saying that comment leavers also apply...
[06:46.820 --> 06:47.740]  Well, they're leaving comments!
[06:47.740 --> 06:50.300]  Yeah, but is there a special escalation for live?
[06:50.800 --> 06:51.520]  No, I don't think so.
[06:51.760 --> 06:53.120]  Look, these are clearly comments.
[06:53.740 --> 06:54.780]  They look like comments to me.
[06:54.780 --> 06:55.460]  They are commenting.
[06:55.500 --> 06:56.320]  Just moving comments.
[06:56.420 --> 06:57.340]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:57.340 --> 06:57.760]  All right, see?
[06:58.020 --> 06:58.740]  Well, that's your answer.
[06:59.840 --> 07:00.160]  Oh!
[07:00.880 --> 07:01.240]  Eww.
[07:01.840 --> 07:02.200]  Why?
[07:03.140 --> 07:04.500]  It's like a little bit of a gag.
[07:04.620 --> 07:06.620]  It's like me when Arrow shits her crate.
[07:07.480 --> 07:08.560]  You go, Eww!
[07:09.960 --> 07:11.000]  We hear that a lot.
[07:12.220 --> 07:14.040]  Do you guys want to open some bullshit up?
[07:14.080 --> 07:15.460]  Let's open cards!
[07:15.480 --> 07:16.500]  I didn't even bring all our stuff.
[07:16.500 --> 07:18.400]  So, cards are back in stores now.
[07:19.260 --> 07:22.700]  Like, the banning of cards in stores is over.
[07:22.820 --> 07:23.940]  Were you aware of this?
[07:23.960 --> 07:24.660]  I've talked about it.
[07:24.780 --> 07:27.900]  You can't buy cards in Target or Walmart because people kept getting shot.
[07:28.820 --> 07:28.940]  What?
[07:29.220 --> 07:29.300]  Yeah.
[07:29.640 --> 07:31.000]  Happened like four times last year.
[07:32.200 --> 07:32.620]  It's good.
[07:32.960 --> 07:35.680]  We fixed it by taking cards away.
[07:35.800 --> 07:37.340]  They took them away for a while, and now they're back.
[07:37.400 --> 07:40.740]  So, every time I go to a store, I've been buying cards for two months.
[07:41.120 --> 07:45.420]  So, I have, like, box upon box upon box of sports stuff that we can get to.
[07:45.420 --> 07:46.940]  And I have a special surprise for you guys.
[07:46.980 --> 07:47.980]  I was going to do it at the end.
[07:48.080 --> 07:50.880]  I'm wondering if it makes sense to do it now.
[07:51.660 --> 07:52.360]  Christmas presents?
[07:54.740 --> 07:55.620]  Tis the season.
[07:55.940 --> 07:57.220]  Well, that's a great idea.
[07:58.140 --> 07:58.940]  Christmas presents?
[07:59.880 --> 08:00.860]  Did you get me something?
[08:04.460 --> 08:05.340]  You're really...
[08:05.340 --> 08:08.420]  Because I got you one.
[08:08.800 --> 08:09.500]  Oh, shit.
[08:09.720 --> 08:12.200]  Me and Gavin actually, we teamed up.
[08:12.320 --> 08:13.040]  Oh, yeah.
[08:13.460 --> 08:13.840]  What happened?
[08:14.220 --> 08:16.600]  We got one for you, Gavin.
[08:16.780 --> 08:17.700]  Oh, my God.
[08:17.820 --> 08:18.500]  Look how big it is.
[08:18.500 --> 08:21.540]  I know that Nick isn't here, but I got one for Nick.
[08:21.640 --> 08:22.320]  Wow, that's nice.
[08:22.720 --> 08:25.260]  Even more nicely wrapped than your present.
[08:25.320 --> 08:26.260]  Oh, Eric, it's not about the size.
[08:26.480 --> 08:27.520]  It's about what's inside it.
[08:27.620 --> 08:27.840]  That's right.
[08:28.160 --> 08:28.920]  I say constantly.
[08:29.420 --> 08:29.820]  Just a little.
[08:30.020 --> 08:30.980]  That's all I need.
[08:31.140 --> 08:33.800]  I didn't want you to feel left out, so I got you.
[08:33.900 --> 08:34.380]  Wow, thank you.
[08:34.640 --> 08:37.360]  And then, Andrew, you're not here either, buddy, but you're here in spirit.
[08:37.720 --> 08:39.620]  And so, I got you a Christmas present as well.
[08:39.680 --> 08:40.180]  Thank you.
[08:40.360 --> 08:41.080]  Yeah, of course.
[08:41.480 --> 08:43.160]  So, we can open them up now?
[08:43.160 --> 08:43.580]  Yeah.
[08:44.260 --> 08:45.160]  Let's do it.
[08:45.580 --> 08:46.980]  Gavin, do you want to open yours first?
[08:47.080 --> 08:48.380]  Gavin, you get the biggest present.
[08:48.480 --> 08:48.900]  Open it first.
[08:48.980 --> 08:50.320]  Look how big it is.
[08:50.760 --> 08:50.800]  Wow.
[08:51.320 --> 08:54.080]  And all we got Geoff was that controller, and I got him one battery.
[08:54.940 --> 08:56.900]  Well, I got a controller and two batteries now.
[08:57.000 --> 08:57.680]  I appreciate that.
[08:57.940 --> 09:02.880]  I'd also like to point out that when I brought these in, Sarah said, oh, did Emily wrap those?
[09:02.980 --> 09:05.720]  And I said, like hell.
[09:06.680 --> 09:07.380]  No offense.
[09:07.500 --> 09:09.080]  Emily is a mediocre wrapper at best.
[09:09.200 --> 09:11.940]  I wrapped these with my own two hands.
[09:12.720 --> 09:13.600]  He did.
[09:13.680 --> 09:15.300]  He didn't even hit it.
[09:16.360 --> 09:17.380]  I'm working on it.
[09:17.500 --> 09:18.000]  I'm working on it.
[09:18.020 --> 09:19.360]  I heard it not finish.
[09:22.440 --> 09:23.720]  Yeah, I taped yours up real good.
[09:23.940 --> 09:24.460]  You don't have tape on it, Geoff?
[09:24.620 --> 09:25.780]  I wanted yours to be safe.
[09:25.940 --> 09:26.180]  Okay.
[09:28.580 --> 09:31.100]  Geoff has proved himself to be the artist of the house.
[09:31.380 --> 09:31.500]  Yeah.
[09:32.140 --> 09:33.380]  The pro wrapper.
[09:33.760 --> 09:34.020]  Yeah.
[09:34.900 --> 09:36.320]  I make the best bacon.
[09:36.580 --> 09:40.720]  But we do have this bag because I keep and recycle every bag given to us.
[09:40.980 --> 09:41.920]  I think you'd recognize it.
[09:42.600 --> 09:45.040]  This is a gift from Ms. Don McDougall.
[09:46.780 --> 09:48.440]  Careful, you might cut what's in there.
[09:48.740 --> 09:49.900]  No, you'll be fine.
[09:50.240 --> 09:50.720]  Oh, okay.
[09:54.260 --> 09:55.600]  Oh, wow, Geoff.
[09:59.660 --> 10:03.760]  It's a couple of face pop sockets.
[10:03.940 --> 10:04.860]  I got them for you.
[10:05.200 --> 10:06.340]  Because I know you have...
[10:06.340 --> 10:08.340]  Every present I got has special meaning.
[10:08.340 --> 10:12.540]  I know that you, for instance, love your phone.
[10:12.780 --> 10:13.680]  You love cell phones.
[10:13.840 --> 10:14.060]  Sure.
[10:14.260 --> 10:15.160]  You buy them all the time.
[10:15.240 --> 10:16.940]  You get mad when I smash them.
[10:17.280 --> 10:21.140]  And so I know that this would probably benefit you and help you out.
[10:21.420 --> 10:23.600]  I got a feeling I know what this is, but it doesn't...
[10:23.600 --> 10:25.320]  You have to pull the tab first.
[10:25.900 --> 10:26.920]  It's actually turned off.
[10:27.180 --> 10:28.020]  But I'll tell you something.
[10:29.600 --> 10:30.580]  Go ahead and open it up.
[10:30.620 --> 10:31.220]  We'll talk about it.
[10:31.260 --> 10:32.740]  I'll tell you what a good gift giver I am.
[10:32.740 --> 10:33.220]  Yeah, let me see.
[10:33.320 --> 10:33.840]  Let me see.
[10:33.840 --> 10:42.180]  There is nothing worse on Christmas morning than opening up your present and then going to use it and there's no batteries in it.
[10:42.240 --> 10:42.780]  This looks...
[10:42.780 --> 10:43.640]  Because your parents didn't leave the...
[10:43.640 --> 10:44.860]  Well, that's why I got you one battery.
[10:45.060 --> 10:46.280]  Yeah, no, I appreciate it.
[10:46.280 --> 10:46.640]  Yeah, no problem.
[10:46.920 --> 10:48.140]  Your parents didn't get it for you.
[10:48.160 --> 10:49.040]  It didn't get you the batteries.
[10:49.160 --> 10:49.560]  No, it works.
[10:50.760 --> 10:51.600]  Straight out of the box.
[10:52.180 --> 10:52.940]  Works straight out of the box.
[10:53.200 --> 10:53.560]  Wow!
[10:54.020 --> 10:55.560]  Yeah, I got that for you.
[10:57.060 --> 10:59.000]  Because you were the producer of the show.
[10:59.220 --> 10:59.780]  That's why.
[10:59.880 --> 11:01.480]  Yeah, and it's fun to hit that button.
[11:01.540 --> 11:02.500]  It is fun to hit the button.
[11:02.500 --> 11:04.080]  Emily, sweetheart, would you like to open up your present?
[11:04.160 --> 11:05.480]  I would love to open up my present.
[11:06.060 --> 11:06.680]  Let's see.
[11:07.600 --> 11:09.160]  Ooh, is this new?
[11:12.220 --> 11:13.620]  That's some of our Jet Ski merch.
[11:13.840 --> 11:14.060]  Wow!
[11:14.420 --> 11:16.500]  Emily, I have it on good authority.
[11:17.280 --> 11:18.900]  You're a real big fan of me.
[11:19.380 --> 11:19.900]  Yeah, I am.
[11:19.900 --> 11:21.500]  So I got you something with my face on it.
[11:21.540 --> 11:23.280]  I'm a big fan of you on a Jet Ski.
[11:23.440 --> 11:25.060]  This is exactly what you look like.
[11:25.900 --> 11:27.040]  And you look really cool.
[11:27.140 --> 11:27.540]  Thank you.
[11:27.560 --> 11:28.240]  And I love it.
[11:28.600 --> 11:30.920]  And then we can hold off and let Nick and Andrew...
[11:30.920 --> 11:31.620]  Oh, let's open them for them.
[11:31.620 --> 11:32.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:32.820 --> 11:34.040]  So this is to you, Nick.
[11:34.080 --> 11:34.820]  We'll get this to you.
[11:34.900 --> 11:35.240]  Don't worry.
[11:35.240 --> 11:35.660]  Merry Christmas.
[11:35.840 --> 11:36.480]  What do you think you got, Andrew?
[11:37.420 --> 11:38.900]  Oh, I got Andrew something very special.
[11:39.220 --> 11:39.380]  Oh.
[11:40.040 --> 11:40.440]  I...
[11:40.440 --> 11:42.820]  If it's not a certain thing, I will be shocked.
[11:46.320 --> 11:47.000]  Let's see.
[11:47.200 --> 11:48.060]  Alright, let's see.
[11:48.580 --> 11:49.960]  I mean, it says...
[11:51.060 --> 11:52.880]  Fuckface Merchboards and Dream Armor.
[11:53.360 --> 11:54.180]  Well, this is the box.
[11:55.080 --> 11:56.320]  This is the box I found.
[11:56.540 --> 11:58.100]  This is the stream.
[12:00.280 --> 12:01.140]  Nick, I got...
[12:01.140 --> 12:02.080]  Because Nick is a cool guy.
[12:02.200 --> 12:02.360]  Yeah.
[12:02.520 --> 12:03.360]  Nick's a really cool guy.
[12:03.380 --> 12:04.740]  That's what I say about him all the time.
[12:04.840 --> 12:09.860]  I got him a Fuckface Floaty Keychain for when he goes jet skiing.
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.080]  And then this cool...
[12:11.080 --> 12:14.480]  This band puts around the back of your sunglasses.
[12:14.800 --> 12:15.300]  Hold some of it still.
[12:15.300 --> 12:19.140]  So that you don't lose them when you fly off your jet ski into the water.
[12:19.600 --> 12:19.660]  Wow.
[12:20.120 --> 12:21.440]  Hey, let's see if it works.
[12:22.560 --> 12:27.860]  When we go fuckface jet skiing next summer all together, he can wear those.
[12:27.860 --> 12:28.380]  Wow.
[12:28.700 --> 12:29.940]  I dropped some of it.
[12:30.060 --> 12:31.240]  Oh, what did you get me?
[12:31.420 --> 12:33.880]  Yours might be the one that I'm the most excited about.
[12:33.980 --> 12:39.360]  Because you are a self-proclaimed Apple man.
[12:40.080 --> 12:40.280]  Uh-huh.
[12:40.440 --> 12:42.060]  You're constantly proclaiming that.
[12:42.200 --> 12:43.640]  You're always talking about apples.
[12:43.800 --> 12:44.780]  How much you love them.
[12:45.240 --> 12:46.420]  How great they are.
[12:46.600 --> 12:47.080]  Unrippable.
[12:47.080 --> 12:48.300]  Absolutely unrippable paper.
[12:48.580 --> 12:49.480]  Jesus Christ.
[12:51.460 --> 12:54.860]  And I wanted you to be able to express...
[12:56.920 --> 12:58.600]  Don't worry, I got this.
[12:59.020 --> 13:08.320]  I wanted you to be able to express and profess your love of apples with this unobtainable notice no scrumping sign.
[13:09.360 --> 13:18.280]  Everything else that I showed off today, everything else that we gave away, these beautiful, wonderful gifts are available right now in the Rooster Teeth store, store.roosterteeth.com.
[13:18.280 --> 13:18.800]  That's real metal.
[13:18.820 --> 13:20.660]  Check out that plastic sign.
[13:20.880 --> 13:21.860]  But not this metal sign.
[13:22.720 --> 13:23.680]  Did you hear that?
[13:23.920 --> 13:24.500]  That's metal.
[13:24.500 --> 13:26.480]  Yeah, that hurts.
[13:27.260 --> 13:28.920]  That hurts the way only metal does.
[13:29.180 --> 13:29.740]  This works.
[13:30.860 --> 13:31.700]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[13:31.800 --> 13:32.180]  That's great.
[13:32.840 --> 13:33.580]  Look out, Nick.
[13:33.600 --> 13:34.940]  You're going to have trouble getting them off him now.
[13:35.140 --> 13:36.060]  He's excited about them.
[13:36.900 --> 13:37.760]  So, I apologize.
[13:38.220 --> 13:40.160]  You can't buy this metal no scrumping sign.
[13:40.980 --> 13:41.700]  It's now...
[13:41.700 --> 13:42.500]  You can buy it from Andrew.
[13:42.720 --> 13:43.620]  Maybe he'll auction it off.
[13:43.620 --> 13:44.460]  Should we put it on the set?
[13:44.720 --> 13:45.140]  It's got stickers.
[13:45.340 --> 13:46.540]  Yeah, we can put it on the set.
[13:46.740 --> 13:47.500]  I taped it to the...
[13:48.080 --> 13:48.520]  There we go.
[13:48.560 --> 13:49.260]  Here, you know...
[13:49.260 --> 13:49.820]  And then...
[13:49.820 --> 13:50.200]  Hold on.
[13:50.820 --> 13:52.300]  But what you can buy...
[13:52.300 --> 13:52.600]  Uh-huh.
[13:52.600 --> 13:54.200]  If you look at the front of here...
[13:54.200 --> 13:54.220]  Right.
[13:54.260 --> 13:56.340]  You can buy a no scrumping sticker, I believe.
[13:56.500 --> 13:56.700]  Wow!
[13:56.740 --> 13:57.240]  It's true!
[13:57.360 --> 13:58.440]  Because they sent it to me in the mail.
[13:58.640 --> 13:59.460]  So, I assumed that means...
[13:59.460 --> 14:00.280]  So, you can still...
[14:00.280 --> 14:02.520]  You know, if you wanted to live vicariously through Andrew...
[14:02.520 --> 14:02.680]  What?
[14:02.760 --> 14:04.340]  Maybe you're like a minor league Apple fan.
[14:04.420 --> 14:04.920]  Get the sticker.
[14:05.060 --> 14:05.640]  What about Nasso?
[14:06.360 --> 14:06.680]  Nasso?
[14:07.260 --> 14:09.460]  Nasso is another sticker you can buy.
[14:09.800 --> 14:09.860]  Uh-huh.
[14:10.100 --> 14:11.020]  Nuggets All Skulls On.
[14:11.440 --> 14:13.740]  It's a very funny joke from the podcast.
[14:14.420 --> 14:17.840]  And I think you can buy that shirt and that sticker right now at our store.
[14:18.080 --> 14:18.220]  Wow!
[14:18.400 --> 14:20.440]  Store.ReachTeeth.com for everything that you see here.
[14:20.860 --> 14:21.140]  I'm sorry.
[14:21.160 --> 14:21.880]  Should we cut you off?
[14:21.880 --> 14:22.300]  What were you saying?
[14:22.740 --> 14:23.660]  I was just moving that out of the way.
[14:23.780 --> 14:24.160]  Oh, okay.
[14:24.760 --> 14:25.620]  She's saying, go to hell.
[14:25.880 --> 14:26.020]  Yeah.
[14:26.240 --> 14:28.840]  My shirts with my sweater is available at store.reachteeth.com too.
[14:29.100 --> 14:29.180]  Wow!
[14:29.500 --> 14:29.860]  She's good at this.
[14:29.860 --> 14:30.820]  She's wearing an Achieva, her.
[14:31.360 --> 14:33.120]  Now, you did bring gifts for everybody.
[14:33.540 --> 14:33.620]  Uh-huh.
[14:33.620 --> 14:34.880]  I wanted you to have a gift.
[14:35.060 --> 14:35.120]  Oh!
[14:36.240 --> 14:36.560]  I...
[14:36.560 --> 14:39.740]  Christmas is hard for me because I'm really bad at keeping secrets from you.
[14:39.820 --> 14:41.640]  So, this is one of your actual Christmas presents.
[14:41.840 --> 14:42.360]  Oh, wow!
[14:43.040 --> 14:43.780]  Like a real present?
[14:43.940 --> 14:44.600]  Like a real present.
[14:45.740 --> 14:46.780]  This is a real present.
[14:47.020 --> 14:48.020]  This is very much a real present.
[14:48.180 --> 14:49.320]  I mean, not that you're...
[14:49.320 --> 14:54.440]  But I think that it would be a good gift to open because I think it has something...
[14:54.440 --> 14:56.040]  could be something with you guys.
[14:56.960 --> 14:57.980]  I don't know this stuff.
[14:58.360 --> 14:59.020]  Like a real present?
[14:59.140 --> 14:59.880]  This is a real...
[14:59.880 --> 15:00.900]  Don't worry, he dropped it.
[15:02.600 --> 15:04.360]  This is very much a real present.
[15:04.680 --> 15:05.340]  Should I open it right now?
[15:05.460 --> 15:05.640]  Yes.
[15:06.080 --> 15:06.760]  No, open it now.
[15:07.560 --> 15:09.420]  That would be insane to give it to him now.
[15:09.420 --> 15:09.920]  It's none.
[15:10.040 --> 15:11.660]  This is just like...
[15:11.660 --> 15:11.860]  Oh!
[15:12.020 --> 15:12.620]  What it is?
[15:13.960 --> 15:16.320]  She got me a box of 2021 NFL Origins.
[15:17.220 --> 15:17.580]  Wow!
[15:17.580 --> 15:20.240]  But it doesn't have like the rookies, so it might have your...
[15:20.240 --> 15:21.120]  This is very expensive.
[15:21.240 --> 15:21.500]  ...guys.
[15:21.960 --> 15:22.120]  Yeah.
[15:22.460 --> 15:25.660]  It's got two autographs and a rookie jumbo jersey autograph.
[15:25.840 --> 15:26.860]  Should we open this first?
[15:27.020 --> 15:27.980]  Yeah, let's get to it.
[15:28.280 --> 15:29.260]  Who do you love to...
[15:29.260 --> 15:29.580]  Mary Zaxby's.
[15:30.220 --> 15:32.360]  Do you think you'll have one of your guys in it?
[15:32.700 --> 15:34.860]  I'm after Najee Harris.
[15:35.320 --> 15:36.140]  So that way it's not in the show.
[15:36.180 --> 15:36.560]  There you go.
[15:36.840 --> 15:37.880]  I'm after Najee Harris.
[15:38.300 --> 15:40.000]  Gavin probably wants a McCorkle.
[15:40.000 --> 15:40.680]  I'll take a McCorkle.
[15:40.840 --> 15:41.100]  Yeah.
[15:41.340 --> 15:41.940]  And then Andrew...
[15:41.940 --> 15:42.700]  You don't want a Matt Jones?
[15:43.500 --> 15:43.880]  McCorkle.
[15:44.720 --> 15:46.000]  Oh, that's right!
[15:46.680 --> 15:49.800]  Sorry, I just get excited about the way you say Matt Jones.
[15:50.880 --> 15:53.180]  I was going to mention this on the podcast yesterday.
[15:54.060 --> 15:56.740]  In addition to Matt Jones playing for Alabama and his name being McCorkle,
[15:57.120 --> 16:00.080]  there's a guy in Alabama right now whose name is Kool-Aid McKinstry.
[16:01.700 --> 16:05.740]  So when he goes into the NFL, he can be the drink in our dinner meal.
[16:05.780 --> 16:06.760]  Yeah, that's incredible.
[16:07.120 --> 16:07.560]  NBA thing we do.
[16:07.600 --> 16:07.960]  Incredible.
[16:08.460 --> 16:10.420]  Oh, these are so expensive.
[16:11.380 --> 16:11.760]  Look at that.
[16:11.940 --> 16:12.360]  Isn't that beautiful?
[16:12.820 --> 16:16.000]  I mean, you could put it probably in the blue square and then they could see it on camera.
[16:17.200 --> 16:18.520]  It's something to think about, I guess.
[16:20.500 --> 16:21.280]  Are you ready?
[16:22.020 --> 16:23.220]  For our first opening?
[16:23.760 --> 16:23.980]  Yeah.
[16:24.320 --> 16:26.780]  Of the last opening of the year?
[16:31.260 --> 16:33.560]  This is so much nicer than all the trash I brought.
[16:37.900 --> 16:38.940]  Here we go.
[16:39.680 --> 16:40.220]  Okay, here we go.
[16:41.420 --> 16:42.380]  All right.
[16:42.900 --> 16:43.640]  Ezekiel Elliot.
[16:43.900 --> 16:44.200]  Beautiful.
[16:44.640 --> 16:44.960]  Origins.
[16:45.040 --> 16:46.140]  Right off the top.
[16:47.360 --> 16:48.200]  Deebo Samuel.
[16:48.500 --> 16:48.980]  Origins.
[16:49.180 --> 16:50.220]  I think that's a base card as well.
[16:50.460 --> 16:51.000]  Uh-oh.
[16:51.140 --> 16:53.060]  Here's our mem card.
[16:53.520 --> 16:54.340]  Future Fabrics.
[16:54.440 --> 16:55.620]  DJ Clark Jr.
[16:55.960 --> 16:56.640]  That's nice.
[16:56.740 --> 16:58.320]  That is a numbered number.
[16:58.520 --> 17:00.000]  71 of 99.
[17:00.460 --> 17:00.780]  Wow.
[17:01.760 --> 17:02.340]  That means there's only...
[17:03.280 --> 17:03.820]  Go ahead.
[17:03.980 --> 17:04.720]  These are beautiful cards.
[17:04.720 --> 17:05.040]  You got it.
[17:05.200 --> 17:06.080]  How's it from the future?
[17:08.100 --> 17:08.340]  Oh.
[17:09.100 --> 17:09.760]  Time travel.
[17:10.420 --> 17:11.620]  Oh, look at that.
[17:11.740 --> 17:12.320]  Holy fuck.
[17:12.760 --> 17:12.920]  Dude.
[17:13.240 --> 17:13.980]  Cornell Powell.
[17:14.300 --> 17:15.520]  Kansas City Chiefs rookie auto.
[17:16.180 --> 17:17.040]  That's on card.
[17:17.940 --> 17:20.560]  Cornell Powell rookie auto on card?
[17:20.600 --> 17:21.180]  On card.
[17:21.280 --> 17:21.640]  Gavin.
[17:21.740 --> 17:22.300]  That's very nice.
[17:22.400 --> 17:22.860]  Hot?
[17:23.340 --> 17:24.720]  Is that better than on fleek?
[17:26.140 --> 17:26.800]  Oh my god.
[17:27.560 --> 17:27.760]  What?
[17:28.180 --> 17:28.700]  Save that for last.
[17:31.080 --> 17:32.120]  Jalen Hurts.
[17:32.280 --> 17:33.760]  Number 112 of 299.
[17:34.180 --> 17:35.580]  Alabama alum.
[17:35.720 --> 17:36.460]  Very nice.
[17:36.720 --> 17:37.620]  I love the designs.
[17:38.140 --> 17:39.220]  Yeah, they're gorgeous cards.
[17:39.220 --> 17:40.680]  Oh, Darius Leonard.
[17:40.880 --> 17:41.340]  That's nice.
[17:41.560 --> 17:42.280]  96 of 99.
[17:42.440 --> 17:42.860]  All numbered.
[17:43.060 --> 17:44.580]  And then I got a redemption card.
[17:46.080 --> 17:46.780]  These are so rare.
[17:48.760 --> 17:49.800]  Najee Harris.
[17:49.960 --> 17:50.560]  Oh, wow.
[17:50.560 --> 17:51.320]  Holy shit.
[17:51.320 --> 17:52.600]  I don't want to show it up.
[17:52.680 --> 17:53.500]  Najee Harris.
[17:53.580 --> 17:54.040]  Really?
[17:54.920 --> 17:55.960]  2031 origins.
[17:56.640 --> 17:58.660]  Rookie Jumbo Jersey autograph.
[17:58.920 --> 17:59.180]  Wow.
[17:59.280 --> 17:59.480]  Really?
[17:59.500 --> 18:02.080]  Rookie Jumbo Jersey autograph.
[18:02.340 --> 18:02.600]  Wow.
[18:02.940 --> 18:04.780]  Rookie Jumbo Jersey autograph.
[18:04.780 --> 18:05.060]  Wait.
[18:05.320 --> 18:05.440]  Wait.
[18:05.580 --> 18:05.780]  Stop.
[18:06.860 --> 18:07.360]  Oh, no.
[18:07.360 --> 18:08.960]  Gavin, you might be promoted.
[18:11.780 --> 18:12.980]  Gavin, you might be back.
[18:13.420 --> 18:15.920]  It's going to take me a year to get that in the mail.
[18:15.980 --> 18:16.140]  Yeah.
[18:16.380 --> 18:18.620]  But oh my god, that's a huge fucking card.
[18:18.640 --> 18:19.240]  That's awesome.
[18:19.360 --> 18:20.180]  Scratch up and redeem online.
[18:21.080 --> 18:27.260]  Sweetheart, if Najee Harris makes it into the Hall of Fame someday, we're going to buy a boat with that card.
[18:27.500 --> 18:29.060]  You just bought us a boat.
[18:29.160 --> 18:30.240]  And a good one, too.
[18:30.440 --> 18:31.440]  Not a used boat.
[18:31.660 --> 18:32.740]  You bought us a new boat.
[18:32.780 --> 18:33.420]  A new boat.
[18:33.620 --> 18:34.160]  A new boat.
[18:34.580 --> 18:36.460]  So that's like an IOU?
[18:37.100 --> 18:37.420]  Yes.
[18:37.840 --> 18:38.040]  Yeah.
[18:38.060 --> 18:41.000]  It's basically what it means is they weren't able to get the card together in time.
[18:41.140 --> 18:43.880]  Either they weren't able to get the autograph or the Jersey pad.
[18:44.200 --> 18:44.980]  Yeah, the Jumbo Jersey.
[18:45.620 --> 18:46.760]  So they send these out.
[18:46.880 --> 18:49.200]  Then you scratch off the thing and put it on the website in the mail.
[18:49.200 --> 18:52.900]  You just have to redeem it by April 6, 2023.
[18:53.300 --> 18:53.480]  Yeah.
[18:53.860 --> 18:54.180]  Oh.
[18:54.380 --> 18:54.820]  Don't forget.
[18:55.240 --> 18:55.420]  Yeah.
[18:55.620 --> 19:01.860]  And by the way, if you get one of those in a pack, like in an old card, and the redemption is expired, they will try to arm it still.
[19:02.020 --> 19:02.300]  Really?
[19:02.420 --> 19:02.740]  If they can.
[19:02.900 --> 19:03.480]  Oh, that's really cool.
[19:03.480 --> 19:07.200]  Sometimes they'll even be like, sorry, we don't have that Najee Harris card anymore, but here's a similar card.
[19:07.580 --> 19:07.840]  Wow.
[19:07.920 --> 19:08.980]  I can't believe you got it.
[19:09.040 --> 19:09.880]  I can't believe I got it either.
[19:10.080 --> 19:10.220]  That's insane.
[19:10.220 --> 19:10.760]  What a pack.
[19:11.500 --> 19:11.820]  Insane.
[19:12.020 --> 19:14.340]  That's a huge card.
[19:15.360 --> 19:16.460]  What a way to start.
[19:16.860 --> 19:17.580]  I love you too.
[19:17.660 --> 19:17.720]  Merry Christmas.
[19:17.720 --> 19:19.560]  I'm sorry I got you a piece of shit shirt.
[19:19.780 --> 19:20.540]  No, you're fine.
[19:20.700 --> 19:21.120]  Merry Christmas.
[19:21.420 --> 19:22.180]  Not a piece of shit.
[19:22.240 --> 19:22.880]  Quality merchandise.
[19:22.980 --> 19:23.060]  Quality merchandise.
[19:23.060 --> 19:25.840]  That's just one less present you're opening on Christmas Day.
[19:25.840 --> 19:25.980]  What's that?
[19:25.980 --> 19:27.700]  That's just one less present you're opening on Christmas Day.
[19:27.740 --> 19:29.160]  Yeah, but I'm going to look at it every day till Christmas.
[19:29.240 --> 19:29.400]  Yeah.
[19:29.520 --> 19:29.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[19:36.700 --> 19:38.600]  What a way to start this one.
[19:38.840 --> 19:39.240]  Yeah.
[19:39.340 --> 19:40.320]  Should we end it now?
[19:40.520 --> 19:40.700]  Yeah.
[19:40.760 --> 19:40.940]  Yeah, right?
[19:41.620 --> 19:42.880]  I've got to get Emily from school anyway.
[19:45.440 --> 19:48.340]  All right, let's take it down a lot of notches.
[19:48.480 --> 19:48.800]  Great.
[19:49.460 --> 19:51.220]  This is some trash, but we'll open it.
[19:51.300 --> 19:51.480]  Okay.
[19:51.580 --> 19:54.400]  This is F1 Tops Turbo Attacks.
[19:54.780 --> 19:58.880]  It's a fucking dumb game, but it was very expensive to get this.
[19:59.220 --> 19:59.760]  Emily and I have been playing this game for a long time.
[19:59.760 --> 20:01.260]  I had to go to the F1...
[20:01.260 --> 20:02.920]  I had to go to the Circuit of the Americans.
[20:03.260 --> 20:06.420]  I had to pay a couple grand to get in the door to get this.
[20:06.520 --> 20:07.240]  We had to sit in traffic.
[20:07.420 --> 20:08.440]  We had to sit in the parking lot.
[20:08.640 --> 20:09.300]  Oh my God.
[20:09.620 --> 20:09.960]  The traffic.
[20:10.380 --> 20:12.960]  If there's a Max Verstappen rookie, I want it.
[20:14.520 --> 20:15.840]  It's not even going to be that cool.
[20:16.260 --> 20:18.960]  Speaking of Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton this weekend.
[20:19.260 --> 20:19.500]  Yep.
[20:20.660 --> 20:21.400]  Let's see what we got.
[20:21.740 --> 20:22.600]  It's a...
[20:22.600 --> 20:23.960]  So this is a game?
[20:24.120 --> 20:25.200]  Yeah, it's like a...
[20:25.200 --> 20:26.160]  Yeah, there's some...
[20:26.620 --> 20:26.960]  Tires.
[20:28.100 --> 20:28.780]  It's like...
[20:28.780 --> 20:29.740]  I don't even know who this person is.
[20:29.740 --> 20:30.760]  Step two.
[20:33.460 --> 20:35.120]  I don't even know what to say about this.
[20:35.380 --> 20:35.760]  That's what...
[20:35.760 --> 20:36.300]  Oh, there you go.
[20:36.440 --> 20:37.820]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[20:37.880 --> 20:37.960]  There you go.
[20:38.040 --> 20:38.720]  There's Charlotte Clarke.
[20:38.760 --> 20:39.420]  Charlotte Clarke.
[20:39.680 --> 20:40.080]  Go back.
[20:40.420 --> 20:41.820]  What the fuck is that?
[20:42.120 --> 20:43.200]  That's the team principal.
[20:43.680 --> 20:44.180]  That's Otmar.
[20:44.180 --> 20:44.680]  Bill and accounting.
[20:44.940 --> 20:46.060]  No, what does that say?
[20:46.240 --> 20:47.400]  What is...
[20:47.400 --> 20:47.980]  Sass is that?
[20:48.620 --> 20:49.460]  Otmar Saffner.
[20:50.720 --> 20:51.600]  He's the team...
[20:51.600 --> 20:51.760]  What?
[20:52.180 --> 20:53.740]  He's the team principal for...
[20:54.340 --> 20:54.960]  He's the principal?
[20:54.960 --> 20:55.500]  What fucking team?
[20:57.280 --> 20:58.780]  Oh, Aston Martin, I believe.
[20:58.780 --> 21:00.320]  He's got...
[21:00.320 --> 21:01.360]  Like, he does punishments?
[21:01.580 --> 21:02.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[21:02.040 --> 21:03.200]  I think he's like the coach.
[21:04.720 --> 21:06.160]  Oh, they should call him that, maybe.
[21:06.200 --> 21:07.020]  He's like the total wolf.
[21:09.640 --> 21:10.680]  This is the best part about this.
[21:10.760 --> 21:11.680]  He's got plus three defense.
[21:12.040 --> 21:12.980]  Oh, all right!
[21:13.220 --> 21:13.820]  That's great.
[21:13.820 --> 21:15.520]  Plus three defense, plus three attack.
[21:17.520 --> 21:18.240]  His face...
[21:18.240 --> 21:18.960]  Go back to it.
[21:19.220 --> 21:23.180]  The way that his face is, it looks like it's an unsolved murder.
[21:24.700 --> 21:27.440]  All right, well, this is being elevated to the...
[21:27.440 --> 21:28.300]  That's a great way.
[21:28.300 --> 21:29.280]  That's a great card.
[21:29.320 --> 21:29.980]  The last card is...
[21:29.980 --> 21:32.360]  That's worth the thousands of dollars you paid.
[21:32.400 --> 21:33.900]  Carlos Sainz and Charlotte Clare.
[21:34.720 --> 21:36.000]  Charlotte Clare looks like Harry Potter.
[21:36.060 --> 21:36.620]  Okay, there you go.
[21:37.700 --> 21:38.780]  That's what I think about every time I see him, I think,
[21:38.840 --> 21:40.500]  I bet Sarah would be in love with this guy if she ever saw him.
[21:40.580 --> 21:41.680]  You hated those cards.
[21:42.200 --> 21:43.500]  They're not real cards, this is the game.
[21:43.620 --> 21:44.420]  They're just a free giveaway.
[21:44.600 --> 21:45.800]  I think I probably have some more in here somewhere.
[21:46.440 --> 21:47.540]  I've had those since...
[21:47.540 --> 21:48.520]  Since October?
[21:48.640 --> 21:48.880]  Yeah.
[21:49.280 --> 21:50.120]  Since you got stuck in that traffic.
[21:50.120 --> 21:52.160]  Since I got stuck in that traffic and I felt no desire to open them.
[21:52.160 --> 21:54.780]  He just got out of the traffic, so...
[21:54.780 --> 21:56.240]  I raced over from October.
[21:57.400 --> 21:59.320]  This is going to be Topps Heritage.
[21:59.600 --> 22:00.080]  What is that?
[22:00.620 --> 22:05.480]  It is a low-end baseball product that Topps makes.
[22:05.620 --> 22:06.180]  What does that mean?
[22:06.300 --> 22:07.640]  It means that they're...
[22:07.640 --> 22:07.940]  Garbage?
[22:08.000 --> 22:09.080]  Cheap and garbage.
[22:09.840 --> 22:11.080]  I'm glad you bought so many.
[22:11.640 --> 22:12.300]  They were cheap.
[22:13.480 --> 22:14.900]  We're at a point where...
[22:14.900 --> 22:16.380]  This looks like an embarrassment of riches,
[22:16.540 --> 22:20.340]  but this is the effect of me...
[22:20.340 --> 22:22.380]  I think I got 19 boxes here of new cards.
[22:22.380 --> 22:26.540]  This is probably 40 trips to the store to get these 19 boxes.
[22:26.780 --> 22:29.980]  So when I see the Topps Heritage, I buy them just because they're fucking there.
[22:30.440 --> 22:33.220]  Aren't there like card stores that you can go to that aren't like Target?
[22:33.600 --> 22:35.080]  Yeah, there's a hobby store I go to all the time.
[22:35.520 --> 22:36.320]  And they just don't have cards?
[22:37.120 --> 22:39.120]  They don't sell retail cards at hobby stores.
[22:39.340 --> 22:41.160]  So there are retail products and hobby products.
[22:41.780 --> 22:46.320]  And if you ask for a retail product at the hobby store, it is embarrassing and you will feel dumb.
[22:46.460 --> 22:47.760]  And they will be okay with that.
[22:47.760 --> 22:52.780]  I've embarrassed myself asking for some Topps holiday baseball card.
[22:52.880 --> 22:54.300]  And they looked at me like I was the dumbest person on earth.
[22:54.360 --> 22:55.040]  And I was like, yes I am.
[22:55.420 --> 22:57.780]  Yeah, the card store doesn't sell cards.
[22:58.000 --> 22:58.760]  Mike Yastrzemski.
[23:01.520 --> 23:06.260]  I was going to say, go back to Mike Yastrzemski or whatever for a second.
[23:06.960 --> 23:10.300]  I've never seen anyone look more casual or be less in action.
[23:10.440 --> 23:12.680]  Have you ever seen anybody less in action in an inaction card?
[23:12.700 --> 23:15.820]  Yes, like for that to be your inaction stance is terrible.
[23:15.860 --> 23:17.540]  I love your Canadian eagle eye.
[23:17.540 --> 23:18.860]  Thank you for pointing that out.
[23:19.220 --> 23:20.060]  We'll keep going.
[23:20.440 --> 23:21.000]  Kent Maida.
[23:22.360 --> 23:24.620]  Here's Tadis Secures a Home Run Win.
[23:24.720 --> 23:26.000]  That's Tatis and yeah, okay.
[23:26.480 --> 23:26.720]  Tadis.
[23:27.640 --> 23:28.360]  Danny Duffy.
[23:29.880 --> 23:30.600]  Austin Hayes.
[23:31.260 --> 23:31.620]  Pooholes.
[23:31.740 --> 23:34.700]  He's playing in, somewhere in Central America now, right?
[23:34.860 --> 23:36.860]  He might be doing like Dominican League, like Winter Balls.
[23:36.920 --> 23:40.460]  Yeah, I think he, because I think he went and hit like a huge home run in his first game.
[23:40.520 --> 23:44.660]  Yeah, it's shocking when he goes, when he goes and plays against people who aren't good enough to make the majors.
[23:44.840 --> 23:45.020]  Yeah.
[23:45.040 --> 23:45.740]  He's very good.
[23:45.740 --> 23:47.480]  Here's Yadier Molina.
[23:47.980 --> 23:48.800]  Ryan Mountcastle.
[23:48.960 --> 23:49.760]  That's a rookie card.
[23:50.280 --> 23:51.280]  That right there.
[23:51.280 --> 23:51.820]  Once again, inaction.
[23:51.820 --> 23:52.580]  Also inaction.
[23:53.040 --> 23:55.400]  Ryan Mountcastle, inaction, playing underhand catch.
[23:56.300 --> 23:58.000]  What does inaction mean?
[23:58.620 --> 23:59.140]  That's great.
[23:59.240 --> 23:59.920]  Because he's the last one.
[24:00.000 --> 24:00.780]  They're just high-fiving.
[24:00.940 --> 24:01.720]  Like, what is inaction?
[24:01.940 --> 24:02.560]  He's not asleep.
[24:03.540 --> 24:04.500]  Rookie stars.
[24:04.740 --> 24:05.420]  Casey Mize.
[24:06.880 --> 24:07.360]  Ooh.
[24:08.440 --> 24:09.160]  Flashback card.
[24:09.260 --> 24:09.580]  This is a big one.
[24:10.400 --> 24:12.540]  1972 Digital Watches introduced.
[24:12.900 --> 24:13.360]  Yeah.
[24:13.360 --> 24:15.940]  You know what we might see on one of these cards?
[24:21.160 --> 24:22.660]  That's pre-Growth Tube.
[24:24.040 --> 24:25.380]  New watch style hits the market.
[24:25.520 --> 24:29.740]  A full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal announced the Pulsar wrist computer was on sale.
[24:29.820 --> 24:31.520]  A completely new way to tell time.
[24:31.860 --> 24:33.280]  Modestly priced at $2,100.
[24:34.380 --> 24:37.340]  That was $150 more than a gold Rolex at the time.
[24:37.620 --> 24:40.100]  By the end of the year, 10,000 a month were produced.
[24:40.120 --> 24:40.720]  Do you think...
[24:40.720 --> 24:41.700]  Demands still remain.
[24:41.700 --> 24:44.300]  Do you think all of the ways to tell time have been invented now?
[24:45.580 --> 24:48.560]  No, there's gotta be a way where, like, eventually you'll just be able to, like, feel it.
[24:48.820 --> 24:49.340]  Feel time?
[24:49.400 --> 24:49.540]  Yeah.
[24:50.580 --> 24:55.080]  Can you imagine being told you didn't make the cut for these cards and learning there's a digital watch card?
[24:55.320 --> 24:56.880]  Like, as a professional baseball player?
[24:56.940 --> 24:58.740]  Yeah, these are the worst cards we make.
[24:58.800 --> 24:59.520]  You didn't make the cut.
[24:59.620 --> 25:01.020]  We had to include a watch.
[25:01.160 --> 25:03.460]  Yeah, they include the 1972 Digital Watch.
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.200]  There's Justin Turner, who does not photograph well, typically.
[25:06.860 --> 25:09.900]  Yeah, that's just how he looks all the time, though, so I don't know.
[25:10.620 --> 25:11.620]  That's pretty menacing.
[25:12.080 --> 25:15.880]  I saw a picture of him on Reddit the other day, like, I don't know, somewhere in the wild with his family.
[25:16.060 --> 25:17.240]  And I was like, oh, so I saw...
[25:17.240 --> 25:19.320]  Right, right, as a human man, he looks fine.
[25:19.400 --> 25:21.020]  But as a baseball player, he looks terrible.
[25:21.200 --> 25:21.260]  Yeah.
[25:21.420 --> 25:22.920]  He's a terrible-looking baseball player.
[25:23.080 --> 25:25.860]  Adam Engel, Orlando Arcea.
[25:26.100 --> 25:28.300]  Oh, speaking of, there's another one, Dustin May.
[25:28.640 --> 25:28.880]  Doesn't photograph well.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.440]  That's, uh, yeah, that's, well, again, I think that's just how he...
[25:31.440 --> 25:32.180]  Young Conan O'Brien there.
[25:32.180 --> 25:33.420]  Yeah, that's just how he looks.
[25:33.560 --> 25:33.980]  Is that a mullet?
[25:34.400 --> 25:34.940]  Well, what was that?
[25:35.000 --> 25:35.720]  No, it's just long hair.
[25:35.780 --> 25:36.280]  He's got long hair.
[25:36.720 --> 25:37.060]  Just terrible looking.
[25:37.280 --> 25:38.080]  Fantastic picture.
[25:38.080 --> 25:39.840]  We should be pulling a side mullet, I think.
[25:40.160 --> 25:41.300]  Oh, right, we should pull a side mullet.
[25:41.400 --> 25:42.060]  It's the back leak season?
[25:42.500 --> 25:44.560]  Tyler O'Neal and Zach Wheeler.
[25:44.820 --> 25:45.180]  Wow.
[25:45.220 --> 25:45.520]  Oh, yeah.
[25:46.900 --> 25:48.520]  Good, what a cards.
[25:48.760 --> 25:50.900]  Uh, let's switch over to basketball for a while.
[25:51.200 --> 25:51.280]  All right.
[25:51.500 --> 25:53.660]  And open up the cheapest of the basketball brands.
[25:53.780 --> 25:54.240]  This is Chronicles.
[25:54.300 --> 25:55.360]  It's what's available.
[25:57.540 --> 25:58.260]  NBA Chronicles.
[25:58.660 --> 26:02.460]  This is gonna be the new rookies, so it's gonna be all rookies in the rookie class.
[26:02.520 --> 26:04.080]  So you're hoping for a Cade Cunningham.
[26:04.220 --> 26:05.680]  You're hoping for an Evan Mobley.
[26:05.680 --> 26:11.540]  You're hoping for a Jalen Suggs, maybe.
[26:13.100 --> 26:13.820]  The Suggmeister.
[26:13.940 --> 26:14.280]  That's about it.
[26:14.380 --> 26:15.360]  Yeah, I'm looking for Suggs.
[26:15.420 --> 26:16.260]  Ty Jones.
[26:17.940 --> 26:18.520]  Oh, here we go.
[26:18.820 --> 26:20.120]  It's a Cade Cunningham rookie right there.
[26:20.120 --> 26:20.440]  Look at that.
[26:20.520 --> 26:20.920]  You did it.
[26:21.020 --> 26:22.100]  Right out the gate, man.
[26:22.460 --> 26:23.880]  He's got about 20 more at home.
[26:24.000 --> 26:24.880]  Yeah, good pulls today.
[26:25.400 --> 26:26.520]  I've opened a lot of these at home.
[26:26.680 --> 26:27.220]  Rayquan Gray.
[26:27.360 --> 26:28.180]  Scotty Barnes rookie.
[26:28.300 --> 26:29.060]  That's another great one.
[26:29.440 --> 26:32.680]  He plays for Toronto and is too good.
[26:32.680 --> 26:34.140]  Take the shit out of that Celtic.
[26:34.280 --> 26:35.420]  Franz Wagner.
[26:35.760 --> 26:37.080]  That's also a good card.
[26:37.460 --> 26:38.440]  Moses Moody.
[26:38.840 --> 26:40.900]  Oh, here's Jalen Suggs.
[26:41.060 --> 26:41.160]  Oh!
[26:43.060 --> 26:46.320]  Maybe like a bronze parallel.
[26:47.500 --> 26:48.600]  Way to go, Suggs.
[26:48.900 --> 26:49.920]  Jalen Johnson.
[26:50.420 --> 26:51.500]  Suggs is a good last name.
[26:51.720 --> 26:51.980]  Yeah.
[26:52.380 --> 26:53.880]  My name is Suggs.
[26:54.720 --> 26:55.740]  Jalen Johnson.
[26:55.880 --> 26:56.660]  Cam Thomas.
[26:57.720 --> 26:59.420]  Keon Johnson played Tennessee.
[26:59.720 --> 26:59.940]  Oh.
[27:00.660 --> 27:02.540]  Aren't those a reference to other cards?
[27:02.540 --> 27:04.420]  Isn't there like a 1990s Hoops?
[27:04.640 --> 27:09.700]  Yeah, this specifically is a reference to 1991 Hoops, I believe.
[27:10.220 --> 27:10.540]  Yes.
[27:10.680 --> 27:12.800]  Corey Kispert and Davion Mitchell.
[27:13.000 --> 27:13.900]  Okay, so just like whatever.
[27:14.960 --> 27:15.980]  Get a couple of Hoops.
[27:20.400 --> 27:21.920]  Let's take a break from sports for a second.
[27:22.980 --> 27:24.440]  Oh, we're going back to Twin Peaks.
[27:24.620 --> 27:27.620]  As long as we don't go back to Umbrella Academy, I'm all in.
[27:27.640 --> 27:29.780]  We should try and pull a Dench if we can at some point.
[27:29.780 --> 27:33.820]  I feel like Twin Peaks and Umbrella Academy are the boxes that will never empty.
[27:34.580 --> 27:36.560]  Somehow there's more than what we started.
[27:36.820 --> 27:39.920]  It's like a gremlin is going in at night and filling them in.
[27:39.980 --> 27:41.480]  And they're like the same ten cards.
[27:41.740 --> 27:42.080]  I know.
[27:42.340 --> 27:42.900]  It's terrible.
[27:43.060 --> 27:43.940]  I wish they were better.
[27:44.080 --> 27:45.920]  I love Twin Peaks so much.
[27:46.520 --> 27:48.700]  That's got to be from the new season.
[27:49.820 --> 27:51.160]  That's old, isn't it?
[27:51.160 --> 27:51.440]  Is it?
[27:51.540 --> 27:51.980]  Who is that?
[27:53.200 --> 27:54.580]  Looks like the guy from Tron.
[27:56.060 --> 27:56.920]  Geoff Bridges.
[27:57.360 --> 27:58.260]  Oh, the bad guy.
[27:58.260 --> 28:00.000]  It's Andrew Packard and Thomas Eckhart.
[28:00.140 --> 28:00.760]  Oh, it is old.
[28:00.860 --> 28:01.200]  You're right.
[28:01.800 --> 28:02.820]  It is season one.
[28:02.940 --> 28:04.200]  I didn't recognize Andrew Eckhart there.
[28:04.640 --> 28:07.400]  Oh, here's dumbass James Hurley kissing some...
[28:07.400 --> 28:08.700]  Oh, on his spray.
[28:09.500 --> 28:10.440]  That's Mattie Ferguson.
[28:11.180 --> 28:12.580]  That is Mattie Ferguson.
[28:12.800 --> 28:14.580]  That is Cheryl Lee playing...
[28:14.580 --> 28:16.780]  Yeah, but that episode hasn't come out yet.
[28:18.020 --> 28:18.300]  Oh.
[28:19.040 --> 28:20.040]  I forget that we're ahead.
[28:20.460 --> 28:22.660]  That's a reference to a future...
[28:23.260 --> 28:24.040]  on this show.
[28:24.460 --> 28:24.940]  Fuckface.
[28:24.940 --> 28:31.980]  Oh, there we have Wyndham Earl and Dale Cooper meeting in the Red Lodge.
[28:33.200 --> 28:33.620]  Or the Black Lodge.
[28:33.620 --> 28:36.680]  I'm starting to think that you should put these cards down sideways so people can see them.
[28:38.640 --> 28:43.320]  Here we have Dr. Hank Jacoby meeting with Bobby Hurley.
[28:43.500 --> 28:44.000]  Is that who that is?
[28:44.060 --> 28:44.800]  Bobby Hurley, is that his name?
[28:46.500 --> 28:47.040]  James Hurley?
[28:47.040 --> 28:47.760]  Hi there.
[28:48.460 --> 28:48.860]  Bobby...
[28:48.860 --> 28:49.420]  Bobby Briggs.
[28:49.520 --> 28:50.100]  Bobby Briggs.
[28:50.160 --> 28:51.560]  Bobby Briggs and Lawrence Jacoby.
[28:51.640 --> 28:52.380]  Dr. Jacoby, yeah.
[28:52.380 --> 28:55.880]  And then, uh, this is gonna blow your dick off.
[28:56.520 --> 28:57.600]  This is gonna blow your dick right off.
[28:57.760 --> 28:57.780]  Okay.
[28:58.280 --> 28:59.720]  Hold on to your dick. Hold on to it.
[28:59.820 --> 29:00.760]  You're gonna lose your shit.
[29:00.980 --> 29:01.120]  Okay.
[29:01.720 --> 29:03.380]  On card, double auto...
[29:04.120 --> 29:05.100]  The Horn Brothers.
[29:07.660 --> 29:08.740]  Look at that!
[29:09.340 --> 29:10.420]  Boy, look at that.
[29:10.620 --> 29:11.700]  Look at that signature.
[29:11.820 --> 29:14.640]  David Patrick Cowley left that on the bottom of a contract and then that.
[29:17.480 --> 29:19.240]  Oh no, my client's an idiot.
[29:20.600 --> 29:26.220]  Dude, those two characters are the best together and that is awesome.
[29:26.900 --> 29:28.620]  On card, double auto.
[29:28.960 --> 29:30.080]  That's about as good as it gets.
[29:30.480 --> 29:30.720]  Wow.
[29:30.840 --> 29:31.780]  Who do you think signed it first?
[29:32.360 --> 29:33.180]  Uh, I think it's pretty clear.
[29:33.360 --> 29:33.540]  Okay.
[29:35.600 --> 29:37.720]  Let's, uh, let's open up and let's try to go for a dench.
[29:38.020 --> 29:38.300]  Okay.
[29:38.420 --> 29:38.880]  Oh, let's get a dench.
[29:38.880 --> 29:39.800]  We also need to get a...
[29:39.800 --> 29:40.140]  Let's pull a dench.
[29:40.180 --> 29:42.840]  I don't know that we have... I don't know that we have...
[29:44.280 --> 29:44.560]  Zimmable...
[29:44.560 --> 29:46.040]  Yeah, I don't know that we have anything Zimmed.
[29:46.040 --> 29:47.100]  Probably in the sack pack.
[29:47.920 --> 29:48.320]  Yes.
[29:49.100 --> 29:49.900]  Would this...
[29:49.900 --> 29:51.260]  Did we pull a Zimm every...
[29:51.620 --> 29:52.180]  No, we...
[29:52.180 --> 29:54.560]  We haven't got Zimms in the last two, I don't think.
[29:55.180 --> 29:56.480]  We're in a bit of a Zimmer drought.
[29:57.280 --> 30:02.480]  Speaking of Zimmer, boy, do we have some Zimmer-inspired merch coming up.
[30:02.620 --> 30:03.740]  I'm so excited for that.
[30:03.940 --> 30:04.500]  It looks great.
[30:04.500 --> 30:06.820]  Let me just say, boys, it's gonna be good.
[30:07.060 --> 30:07.560]  I'm excited.
[30:08.560 --> 30:09.400]  Very excited about it.
[30:09.400 --> 30:11.740]  Who would have thought that that's where this show went?
[30:12.000 --> 30:12.560]  Who would have thought?
[30:13.180 --> 30:13.580]  Really?
[30:13.740 --> 30:14.400]  A million years.
[30:14.400 --> 30:17.260]  And I was literally just like, I thought we were gonna go for Jim Leland.
[30:20.240 --> 30:24.420]  Okay, that looks like James Bond is standing.
[30:24.560 --> 30:25.000]  Walking.
[30:25.620 --> 30:28.100]  I'd argue that's the most in-action card we've got so far.
[30:28.100 --> 30:29.300]  That is in-action big time.
[30:29.460 --> 30:30.820]  There's a...
[30:30.820 --> 30:31.380]  Oh boy.
[30:31.720 --> 30:34.800]  Looks like Javier Bardeen staring off in the desert.
[30:36.240 --> 30:36.860]  It's quantum.
[30:37.440 --> 30:39.620]  Here's a minor car accident.
[30:40.400 --> 30:43.340]  I think we caught it right before they exchanged insurance information.
[30:46.520 --> 30:49.060]  I'm gonna rely heavily on Gavin here because I don't remember this.
[30:49.320 --> 30:50.520]  It's all quantum shit.
[30:50.900 --> 30:51.280]  And then that.
[30:51.400 --> 30:52.040]  All good from Lincoln.
[30:52.460 --> 30:53.260]  And then...
[30:53.260 --> 30:53.820]  Oh, here we go.
[30:54.280 --> 30:54.860]  We got a Dench.
[30:54.900 --> 30:55.620]  We got a Dench.
[30:56.060 --> 30:56.600]  Dr. Dench.
[30:56.600 --> 30:57.340]  We did get a Dench.
[30:57.460 --> 30:58.100]  We did get a Dench.
[30:58.160 --> 30:58.400]  There we go.
[30:58.460 --> 30:58.980]  Mr. White.
[30:59.600 --> 31:00.340]  Mr. White?
[31:01.320 --> 31:02.960]  Is that a code name or his real name?
[31:03.820 --> 31:04.540]  No, it's a code name.
[31:04.760 --> 31:05.220]  The guy in the middle.
[31:05.400 --> 31:07.480]  Don't see that every day.
[31:07.880 --> 31:09.480]  Emily's learning about all the other pages.
[31:10.120 --> 31:10.740]  The other one.
[31:10.940 --> 31:11.320]  It's good.
[31:11.460 --> 31:11.720]  It's good.
[31:12.820 --> 31:13.900]  Oh, this is crazy.
[31:13.900 --> 31:18.580]  It looks like James Bond is holding on to a wire bed frame.
[31:18.580 --> 31:19.120]  It does!
[31:19.320 --> 31:20.000]  I believe.
[31:20.920 --> 31:22.340]  He's helping someone move.
[31:22.500 --> 31:26.940]  He's like, oh no, he woke up in the bed and breakfast and it's on fire.
[31:27.820 --> 31:28.840]  He's gotta get downstairs.
[31:29.820 --> 31:32.340]  It's where they trapped Daniel Craig until he signed on to make another one.
[31:32.400 --> 31:34.040]  They said one more and he said no.
[31:35.060 --> 31:37.200]  I didn't even know what to say about that one.
[31:37.300 --> 31:38.820]  It's just Daniel Craig.
[31:39.460 --> 31:41.080]  Is that like a script meeting or something?
[31:41.260 --> 31:42.200]  Is that from the film?
[31:44.240 --> 31:44.640]  Pigeon?
[31:46.180 --> 31:46.580]  Pigeon?
[31:46.840 --> 31:47.800]  I assume that's what he's seen.
[31:48.020 --> 31:49.180]  Oh, is he shooting a pigeon?
[31:50.560 --> 31:51.420]  Oh, here you go.
[31:51.460 --> 31:53.380]  Here's a young bean.
[31:53.800 --> 31:54.140]  Nice.
[31:54.220 --> 31:55.880]  A little hint of Goldeneye in there.
[31:56.100 --> 31:56.420]  That's lovely.
[31:57.640 --> 31:58.400]  Oh, here we go.
[31:58.560 --> 31:58.960]  Plane.
[31:59.760 --> 32:00.160]  Farmer.
[32:00.820 --> 32:02.440]  That's gonna go great with my digital watch.
[32:02.960 --> 32:03.140]  Yeah.
[32:04.620 --> 32:05.460]  And then this.
[32:05.600 --> 32:06.000]  Awesome.
[32:06.660 --> 32:09.300]  Looks like two men get in their...
[32:09.300 --> 32:10.700]  Why don't they zoom out more?
[32:11.860 --> 32:12.660]  Further away.
[32:12.660 --> 32:13.480]  Further away.
[32:13.720 --> 32:17.880]  It looks like when you google a restaurant and you see like the google street view below the photo.
[32:18.220 --> 32:19.680]  Like that's how far away it is.
[32:21.480 --> 32:22.940]  Alright, so we got a dench.
[32:23.000 --> 32:23.380]  We got a dench.
[32:23.860 --> 32:24.580]  We got a bean.
[32:24.580 --> 32:25.400]  We got a bean.
[32:25.560 --> 32:25.760]  Yeah.
[32:26.500 --> 32:27.480]  What should we open?
[32:27.480 --> 32:28.660]  You wanna try those UFC cards?
[32:28.820 --> 32:29.780]  Let's try the UFC cards.
[32:29.860 --> 32:31.020]  I think he buried them.
[32:32.140 --> 32:36.460]  Oh, you know what else I got that you guys might like?
[32:36.720 --> 32:39.820]  It means nothing to me, but I got it for y'all because you guys are younger than I am.
[32:40.000 --> 32:40.900]  Space Jam cards.
[32:41.260 --> 32:41.540]  Oh.
[32:41.540 --> 32:43.280]  Well, Space Jam two cards.
[32:43.540 --> 32:44.960]  Space Jam two cards, yeah.
[32:45.060 --> 32:46.260]  They're all the same characters, right?
[32:46.620 --> 32:49.440]  Bugs Bunny, the lady Bugs Bunny, the other people.
[32:50.020 --> 32:52.920]  It's not the same girl Bunny.
[32:53.060 --> 32:53.740]  I don't know.
[32:54.680 --> 32:55.480]  She's different.
[32:56.020 --> 32:58.840]  I never, I'll be honest, I never saw Space Jam one or two, so I...
[32:58.840 --> 33:00.700]  Yeah, I mean, you're not really missing much.
[33:00.700 --> 33:03.080]  Oh, you don't think he's missing out on algae rhythm?
[33:03.320 --> 33:03.660]  I mean...
[33:05.140 --> 33:09.820]  I think that the first Space Jam, he was not of age for that.
[33:10.120 --> 33:11.020]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[33:11.020 --> 33:12.560]  I was a little too old for Space Jam one.
[33:12.740 --> 33:12.860]  Yeah.
[33:12.920 --> 33:14.400]  And way too old for Space Jam two.
[33:15.040 --> 33:16.140]  Oh, you know what we're gonna do?
[33:16.300 --> 33:16.640]  Yeah, what's up?
[33:16.640 --> 33:17.780]  We're gonna go ahead and throw...
[33:17.780 --> 33:18.560]  Oh, you gotta throw one in.
[33:19.040 --> 33:20.440]  This guy in the pack sack.
[33:20.880 --> 33:22.880]  If that has a Nick Diaz in it, though, I'm gonna flip.
[33:23.020 --> 33:23.840]  In the pack sack.
[33:24.680 --> 33:27.020]  And then while we're in the pack sack, I'll pull out...
[33:27.620 --> 33:29.740]  It just looks like suck puck from a distance.
[33:30.500 --> 33:32.040]  Are you looking at what you're picking?
[33:33.060 --> 33:35.340]  Well, I'm trying to pick zimmable cards.
[33:35.800 --> 33:35.940]  Oh.
[33:36.280 --> 33:36.680]  I'm trying to zim.
[33:36.980 --> 33:38.600]  We could zim today, that'd be...
[33:38.600 --> 33:38.780]  Yeah.
[33:39.320 --> 33:39.680]  Wow.
[33:40.420 --> 33:40.660]  I don't know.
[33:42.020 --> 33:44.460]  Are these like... is like the anti-theft thing on it?
[33:44.580 --> 33:44.720]  Yeah.
[33:44.860 --> 33:45.140]  Okay.
[33:46.340 --> 33:48.440]  Have you done an old gum from these?
[33:49.460 --> 33:50.040]  Don't remember.
[33:50.220 --> 33:50.680]  I feel like we've all done it.
[33:50.780 --> 33:51.500]  I feel like I have.
[33:51.940 --> 33:53.000]  Everybody but you's done it.
[33:54.340 --> 33:57.480]  You looked at him when you said it, but then looked at me right after.
[33:57.720 --> 33:59.880]  Everybody but somebody other than me's done it.
[34:00.080 --> 34:00.680]  Oh, here we go.
[34:01.000 --> 34:02.000]  Leaning on Eric here.
[34:02.480 --> 34:03.340]  Oh, cool hat.
[34:03.500 --> 34:03.680]  And Andrew.
[34:03.760 --> 34:05.120]  This is Habib.
[34:05.500 --> 34:05.860]  Undefeated.
[34:06.020 --> 34:06.920]  Is that a hat or is that his hair?
[34:07.540 --> 34:08.160]  It's a hat.
[34:08.160 --> 34:08.200]  It's a hat.
[34:08.360 --> 34:08.800]  It's a hat.
[34:08.960 --> 34:09.560]  I wish it was his hair.
[34:09.840 --> 34:10.040]  Okay.
[34:10.720 --> 34:12.620]  Can you imagine fighting with hair like that?
[34:12.980 --> 34:13.600]  It would be amazing.
[34:13.960 --> 34:15.120]  Can we make the screen smaller?
[34:16.880 --> 34:18.100]  Can we not use that big screen right there?
[34:18.100 --> 34:18.940]  Trying to put it on the phone.
[34:19.240 --> 34:20.660]  Didn't even realize it until we started.
[34:23.600 --> 34:24.240]  Israel Adizania.
[34:24.300 --> 34:24.740]  He's champion.
[34:25.080 --> 34:25.340]  Champion.
[34:26.620 --> 34:27.560]  Middleweight, I want to say?
[34:27.820 --> 34:31.380]  I don't... he tried to fight light heavyweight recently, lost, and I believe he's a middleweight
[34:31.380 --> 34:31.600]  fan.
[34:31.680 --> 34:32.700]  He might not be, though.
[34:32.940 --> 34:33.680]  Ooh, here we go.
[34:33.720 --> 34:33.860]  From New Zealand.
[34:34.420 --> 34:35.700]  Rated rookie Kevin Holland.
[34:35.900 --> 34:36.600]  Is he... do we like him?
[34:37.060 --> 34:38.300]  He's got a scorpion tattoo.
[34:38.620 --> 34:39.540]  I have no awareness of Kevin Holland.
[34:39.720 --> 34:42.040]  It's also weird to refer to UFC fighters as rookies.
[34:42.120 --> 34:42.580]  Yeah, no kidding.
[34:43.160 --> 34:43.420]  He's a rated rookie.
[34:43.640 --> 34:44.300]  He's a rookie.
[34:44.400 --> 34:45.560]  He had one fight, I guess?
[34:45.680 --> 34:46.880]  I don't know what that means in the context.
[34:46.880 --> 34:49.300]  It means he's been doing this before UFC for a long time.
[34:49.500 --> 34:51.820]  She's the lady that took out Ronda Rousey, Holly Holm.
[34:51.880 --> 34:52.260]  She did.
[34:52.340 --> 34:52.880]  I remember that.
[34:53.280 --> 34:54.960]  And then she lost her next fight, I think, right?
[34:56.160 --> 34:57.280]  She only had one...
[34:57.280 --> 34:57.680]  Pink parallel.
[34:58.760 --> 35:00.440]  It doesn't come pink, that's actually nice.
[35:00.840 --> 35:03.600]  And then this guy, Figueroa.
[35:04.480 --> 35:05.520]  He's a great flyweight.
[35:05.520 --> 35:06.600]  Great flyweight, yeah.
[35:06.920 --> 35:07.660]  Very entertaining.
[35:07.840 --> 35:11.700]  Flyweight fights are a lot of fun because they just hit each other so hard and nobody ever goes down.
[35:12.200 --> 35:12.820]  What's flyweight?
[35:13.160 --> 35:15.180]  Like, super light guys.
[35:15.300 --> 35:15.620]  Ultra lightweight?
[35:15.800 --> 35:17.500]  Yeah, like really lightweight guys.
[35:17.980 --> 35:19.100]  Feather, how you doing over there?
[35:19.280 --> 35:19.920]  I'm good, how are you?
[35:20.040 --> 35:20.660]  Good, you having fun?
[35:21.040 --> 35:21.220]  Yeah.
[35:21.540 --> 35:22.280]  Happy to see you.
[35:24.980 --> 35:26.520]  It just kept going.
[35:26.840 --> 35:28.240]  I stopped it early, too.
[35:28.560 --> 35:30.380]  Here we go, this is Masvidal.
[35:30.580 --> 35:32.120]  Oh, Jorge!
[35:32.620 --> 35:33.320]  He's in the soda.
[35:33.540 --> 35:34.220]  We like him.
[35:34.220 --> 35:35.620]  That guy's got a long gut.
[35:36.760 --> 35:39.160]  He showed up in AEW, did some pro wrestling.
[35:39.520 --> 35:39.880]  Really?
[35:40.060 --> 35:40.420]  Yeah.
[35:41.360 --> 35:46.380]  Where he had a decent fight career, then he went and filmed a reality TV show in Turkey.
[35:46.560 --> 35:48.580]  It was like, what the fuck am I doing with my life?
[35:48.620 --> 35:50.120]  And then went on this insane run.
[35:50.440 --> 35:54.140]  And now he's doing pro wrestling stuff, he's an American Top Team guy.
[35:54.720 --> 35:55.020]  He's good.
[35:55.400 --> 35:55.740]  Masvidal.
[35:56.140 --> 35:56.420]  Nice.
[35:57.340 --> 35:58.380]  And then this guy.
[35:59.260 --> 36:00.160]  Khabib without the hat.
[36:00.600 --> 36:01.980]  Oh, that's the same guy with the hat!
[36:02.100 --> 36:02.860]  Same guy with the hat.
[36:02.860 --> 36:04.360]  You know what, I see why he wears the hat.
[36:05.320 --> 36:06.180]  It's a good look.
[36:07.420 --> 36:08.420]  Oh, shit!
[36:08.600 --> 36:08.960]  What do we got?
[36:09.360 --> 36:12.200]  I'll tell you what we got from my man, Eric.
[36:12.320 --> 36:12.580]  Yeah?
[36:12.940 --> 36:13.780]  Nate Diaz.
[36:13.940 --> 36:14.380]  Oh!
[36:15.840 --> 36:16.440]  This guy.
[36:16.600 --> 36:18.160]  So I was explaining, Gavin.
[36:18.240 --> 36:26.120]  Nate and Nick Diaz are like Inland Empire trash people that I grew up with.
[36:26.340 --> 36:30.060]  They just smoke weed and steal dirt bikes and hate their stepdad.
[36:30.060 --> 36:33.320]  Those are my guys.
[36:33.540 --> 36:34.140]  That's like my people.
[36:34.360 --> 36:38.240]  If you like that Nate Diaz, you're going to love this Nate Diaz.
[36:38.320 --> 36:38.760]  Whoa!
[36:39.080 --> 36:40.120]  Which is a cut out.
[36:40.240 --> 36:40.940]  That's awesome.
[36:41.460 --> 36:41.900]  Yeah, look at that.
[36:41.900 --> 36:45.100]  That card makes him look like a juggalo, maybe?
[36:46.420 --> 36:47.180]  That's really cool.
[36:47.200 --> 36:49.800]  It looks like he's holding up the card that's collapsing around him.
[36:51.780 --> 36:52.620]  That's cool.
[36:52.880 --> 36:55.140]  And then last card, Figueroa again.
[36:56.520 --> 36:57.600]  This guy looks like...
[36:57.600 --> 37:02.000]  I know that's not, but it looks like he's got Avatar last airbender thing on his head.
[37:02.580 --> 37:03.060]  Like an arrow.
[37:03.720 --> 37:03.960]  See?
[37:04.880 --> 37:05.680]  Oh, yeah.
[37:05.780 --> 37:06.760]  That's what you're talking about.
[37:07.020 --> 37:08.500]  He knows that, but he doesn't know...
[37:13.600 --> 37:14.020]  Alright.
[37:14.360 --> 37:15.840]  They're called groan tubes.
[37:16.020 --> 37:16.720]  Groan tubes.
[37:17.660 --> 37:18.820]  We've got to make one.
[37:19.180 --> 37:20.460]  It's like the worst thing.
[37:21.680 --> 37:22.880]  I'll message Tony.
[37:22.980 --> 37:23.920]  Hey, can we make groan tubes?
[37:24.460 --> 37:26.640]  That's what my butthole was the week of the colonoscopy.
[37:27.100 --> 37:28.280]  It was a groan tube.
[37:28.520 --> 37:29.560]  Oh, that's Origins.
[37:30.420 --> 37:30.820]  What?
[37:31.260 --> 37:31.660]  Oh, Habib.
[37:32.000 --> 37:32.540]  Once again.
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.660]  Famous for wrestling a bear as a child.
[37:36.560 --> 37:37.180]  I guess he won.
[37:37.820 --> 37:38.260]  He did.
[37:38.960 --> 37:39.060]  Yeah.
[37:39.200 --> 37:39.640]  Oh, shit.
[37:39.720 --> 37:40.920]  It's fucking Nate Diaz day.
[37:41.180 --> 37:43.000]  Now we got his ten years card.
[37:44.840 --> 37:45.680]  Oh, here's Mas Vidal.
[37:45.940 --> 37:46.460]  We like him.
[37:46.520 --> 37:47.000]  You were just saying.
[37:47.700 --> 37:47.880]  Yeah.
[37:50.340 --> 37:51.680]  He's the one with the long torso?
[37:52.180 --> 37:52.620]  Yeah, Mas Vidal.
[37:53.260 --> 37:56.460]  Okay, I've informed merch that we want to make groan tubes.
[37:56.620 --> 37:57.440]  Okay, here we go.
[37:57.480 --> 37:58.240]  Mas Vidal again.
[37:58.380 --> 37:59.940]  Apparently there's not a lot of UFC fighters.
[38:00.420 --> 38:03.140]  Probably not a lot that sign contracts to have cards made.
[38:03.280 --> 38:03.780]  Probably not.
[38:04.100 --> 38:04.880]  And then this guy.
[38:05.740 --> 38:06.460]  Another rookie.
[38:07.660 --> 38:08.020]  Chim Mayhev.
[38:08.020 --> 38:08.720]  No idea who he is.
[38:09.040 --> 38:09.620]  I mean...
[38:10.160 --> 38:11.900]  Well, keep your eye out because he'll be huge.
[38:12.900 --> 38:14.080]  According to this card I kept.
[38:14.600 --> 38:15.340]  That's a big thing.
[38:16.220 --> 38:18.640]  Wait until his second, third, fourth year when he comes into his own.
[38:20.240 --> 38:20.960]  All right.
[38:20.960 --> 38:22.720]  We're still going with these Chronicles guys.
[38:22.720 --> 38:25.140]  Someone in the chat says we should call them *** sticks.
[38:26.260 --> 38:27.580]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[38:27.600 --> 38:28.080]  I like that.
[38:28.180 --> 38:28.820]  That's pretty good.
[38:28.920 --> 38:29.720]  I like that.
[38:29.980 --> 38:31.740]  I'll let them know what we want to call them.
[38:31.800 --> 38:32.440]  Here's Francis.
[38:32.700 --> 38:33.460]  Elric Aron.
[38:33.820 --> 38:34.800]  Amazing heavyweight fighter.
[38:34.920 --> 38:36.900]  If you're going to be a dude named Francis, you probably need to be a fighter.
[38:37.060 --> 38:37.780]  That's smart.
[38:38.100 --> 38:38.760]  You think so?
[38:39.960 --> 38:42.580]  I mean, that's what Andrew Panton said.
[38:43.800 --> 38:46.400]  Mas Vidal, that's right before he fought Ben Askren.
[38:46.600 --> 38:48.080]  He was like leaning against the cage, I believe.
[38:48.220 --> 38:50.640]  And then he knocked out Ben Askren in like three seconds.
[38:50.640 --> 38:54.200]  That moment is followed immediately by him sprinting to the middle of the cage
[38:54.200 --> 38:55.780]  and throwing a flying knee to knock out this guy.
[38:55.780 --> 38:56.380]  Oh, wow.
[38:57.460 --> 39:01.560]  Here's the Nate Diaz, I'm guessing, the base version of this card.
[39:01.680 --> 39:02.800]  So we've got two of the crowns.
[39:02.960 --> 39:04.180]  He's holding up both cards.
[39:04.740 --> 39:05.400]  That's pretty cool.
[39:07.680 --> 39:10.560]  And then Amanda Nunez.
[39:11.680 --> 39:12.780]  He got it!
[39:13.060 --> 39:13.780]  He got it!
[39:14.060 --> 39:15.480]  Tony on the ball.
[39:15.780 --> 39:19.000]  I said we want to make face grown tubes.
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.280]  And he said, are those the things that go weow when you turn them over?
[39:23.340 --> 39:24.420]  He even spelled it right.
[39:28.380 --> 39:30.660]  I've never seen it written, but that's so good.
[39:30.760 --> 39:34.820]  W-E-O-O-O-O-O-H-H-H-W-W.
[39:35.880 --> 39:36.400]  Weow.
[39:37.240 --> 39:38.280]  Let's put that on a shirt.
[39:38.880 --> 39:41.060]  Let's get some weow in the chat.
[39:41.360 --> 39:43.400]  Another rated rookie, it's Cyril Gane.
[39:43.440 --> 39:45.680]  And he looks like he's punching through the card at you.
[39:45.980 --> 39:47.040]  It's in the chat.
[39:47.040 --> 39:48.640]  I think it's the new most inaction card.
[39:48.640 --> 39:49.720]  I think it's number one on the inaction list.
[39:49.720 --> 39:51.900]  That's an extremely action based action card.
[39:51.920 --> 39:53.420]  Yo, what's up Jamie with weow.
[39:54.920 --> 39:55.720]  Israel Adesanya.
[39:57.320 --> 39:59.960]  Here we have Francis again.
[40:00.780 --> 40:02.400]  Oh, interesting, it's certified in here.
[40:02.500 --> 40:03.000]  Certified is good.
[40:03.060 --> 40:03.580]  That's a pink.
[40:04.020 --> 40:05.080]  Certified should be num...
[40:05.080 --> 40:06.420]  Well, I guess it's not on this.
[40:07.720 --> 40:10.140]  On basketball, that'd be of 25.
[40:10.540 --> 40:11.400]  But this is not.
[40:12.040 --> 40:12.940]  I guess that's not the pink handle.
[40:13.320 --> 40:13.720]  Anyway.
[40:14.960 --> 40:15.360]  Figueroa.
[40:16.320 --> 40:17.120]  And then...
[40:17.120 --> 40:17.960]  Oh, Chimayev.
[40:18.280 --> 40:18.640]  Another...
[40:18.640 --> 40:19.920]  That's his second rookie card we got.
[40:20.220 --> 40:20.420]  Wow.
[40:20.420 --> 40:21.000]  Keep an eye out.
[40:21.140 --> 40:21.820]  Dude, he's gonna...
[40:21.820 --> 40:22.880]  I heard he's gonna tear it up.
[40:23.220 --> 40:25.280]  According to rumors I'm starting, that's the next champ.
[40:29.200 --> 40:31.780]  This is so fun, opening up UFC cards.
[40:32.880 --> 40:34.180]  A whole new world for me.
[40:35.760 --> 40:36.480]  Oh, Usman.
[40:36.660 --> 40:37.300]  I know that name.
[40:37.900 --> 40:38.120]  We love him.
[40:38.120 --> 40:38.620]  He's a champion.
[40:38.660 --> 40:39.060]  He's got a belt.
[40:39.740 --> 40:40.020]  He is.
[40:40.080 --> 40:42.660]  He's one of the more dominant, arguably best vault to weight of all time.
[40:42.940 --> 40:43.320]  There you go.
[40:43.520 --> 40:45.380]  Never heard of this guy, but Nate Diaz.
[40:45.480 --> 40:45.840]  Wow.
[40:45.840 --> 40:46.720]  He's in the playoffs.
[40:47.100 --> 40:47.140]  Apparently.
[40:47.540 --> 40:51.740]  So definitely there are like a dozen people who signed contracts to have cards made.
[40:51.840 --> 40:52.720]  Oh, 100%.
[40:52.720 --> 40:53.140]  Yes.
[40:53.840 --> 40:54.680]  Zhang Weili.
[40:57.480 --> 40:58.600]  Dan Iggy.
[40:59.380 --> 41:00.180]  I-G.
[41:01.140 --> 41:02.140]  Dan Igg.
[41:02.420 --> 41:04.080]  It's a rated rookie right there.
[41:04.320 --> 41:05.480]  It's a pink...
[41:05.480 --> 41:06.200]  Wow.
[41:07.240 --> 41:07.980]  Pink prism.
[41:08.500 --> 41:10.180]  We got weos in the chat.
[41:11.480 --> 41:12.240]  And then...
[41:12.240 --> 41:13.440]  Oh, Zhang Weili.
[41:13.760 --> 41:14.160]  There you go.
[41:14.280 --> 41:15.120]  Amazing fighter.
[41:15.300 --> 41:15.820]  I guess this doesn't count.
[41:16.260 --> 41:16.660]  Weili.
[41:17.640 --> 41:17.880]  Weili.
[41:18.100 --> 41:20.000]  It's probably more complicated to have like a wide list.
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.480]  Yeah, you would think so until you open the WWE cards and then you see everyone.
[41:25.200 --> 41:26.480]  Oh, he looks happy about it.
[41:26.820 --> 41:27.280]  Take a look at that.
[41:27.640 --> 41:28.620]  Matt Schnell.
[41:28.980 --> 41:29.160]  Yeah.
[41:30.060 --> 41:32.440]  That was actually on a loss, which is shocking.
[41:32.660 --> 41:33.480]  Oh, he looks like he's happy.
[41:33.480 --> 41:35.780]  That's crazy because they're like raising his arm like he won.
[41:35.840 --> 41:35.980]  Yeah.
[41:36.160 --> 41:36.320]  Yeah.
[41:36.580 --> 41:37.140]  That was quick.
[41:37.700 --> 41:38.300]  Isn't that what that means?
[41:39.280 --> 41:40.340]  Ooh, Khabib again.
[41:40.400 --> 41:41.340]  This is a better shot of his.
[41:41.380 --> 41:41.680]  Is that a cool hat?
[41:41.680 --> 41:42.740]  You can definitely tell it's a hat.
[41:43.140 --> 41:43.400]  Yep.
[41:43.440 --> 41:43.880]  This time.
[41:43.880 --> 41:46.160]  He's remembering the bear he wrestled as a child.
[41:46.240 --> 41:46.580]  Yep.
[41:46.720 --> 41:47.160]  In that moment.
[41:47.260 --> 41:48.520]  He's like, you're the number one bear.
[41:49.300 --> 41:51.660]  Oh, we got one of those crown Masvidal cards.
[41:51.760 --> 41:52.240]  That's cool.
[41:52.280 --> 41:52.580]  That's cool.
[41:53.380 --> 41:54.180]  Another Chimayev.
[41:54.260 --> 41:55.780]  We've had 4,000 of this guy's rookie.
[41:55.920 --> 41:56.100]  Yeah.
[41:56.480 --> 42:01.260]  Please, please, please let him be the LeBron James of UFC.
[42:02.940 --> 42:03.740]  I don't...
[42:03.740 --> 42:07.900]  Please let him be the Tom Brady of middleweight UFC.
[42:09.420 --> 42:10.620]  Israel Adesanya again.
[42:10.680 --> 42:10.840]  Cool.
[42:11.160 --> 42:12.020]  He's got cool tattoos.
[42:12.780 --> 42:13.960]  That is an elite card.
[42:14.020 --> 42:14.420]  That's nice.
[42:14.500 --> 42:15.140]  That's a nice card.
[42:15.980 --> 42:17.980]  Andrew, are you saying he's from New Zealand?
[42:18.220 --> 42:18.600]  Is that right?
[42:18.680 --> 42:18.980]  Yes.
[42:19.080 --> 42:19.880]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[42:20.260 --> 42:21.180]  Let's see if we can zim up.
[42:21.220 --> 42:21.960]  Oh, we're going to zim it?
[42:22.080 --> 42:22.660]  Yeah, we'll try.
[42:22.860 --> 42:22.920]  All right.
[42:23.040 --> 42:23.360]  We'll see.
[42:23.480 --> 42:24.040]  We'll see what's up.
[42:24.280 --> 42:25.200]  So is Gavin eating the gum?
[42:25.260 --> 42:25.540]  Is that what's happening?
[42:25.560 --> 42:26.720]  Yeah, I think Gavin said he was going to eat the gum.
[42:28.540 --> 42:29.720]  I'll have a piece of the gum.
[42:30.560 --> 42:31.640]  You have some gum with me or no?
[42:31.940 --> 42:32.980]  I had the gum already.
[42:34.220 --> 42:34.860]  Mark Grant.
[42:34.960 --> 42:35.600]  I've done this before.
[42:35.780 --> 42:36.100]  Hey!
[42:36.900 --> 42:37.540]  Padre's announcer.
[42:37.960 --> 42:38.940]  Former Padre's pitcher.
[42:39.900 --> 42:40.540]  Relief guy.
[42:41.080 --> 42:41.400]  Awesome.
[42:41.400 --> 42:42.500]  Call him Mudcat.
[42:43.660 --> 42:44.140]  Mudcat.
[42:44.380 --> 42:44.860]  Mudcat.
[42:45.140 --> 42:45.280]  Why?
[42:45.960 --> 42:47.000]  I don't know.
[42:47.880 --> 42:48.500]  We should find out.
[42:48.880 --> 42:49.900]  He's the Padre's announcer.
[42:49.940 --> 42:50.600]  He's the fucking best.
[42:50.960 --> 42:51.460]  I love Mark Grant.
[42:51.740 --> 42:52.260]  Lou Whittaker.
[42:53.240 --> 42:54.120]  Brian Harvey.
[42:54.380 --> 42:56.200]  This is a who's who of 1989.
[42:56.760 --> 42:57.720]  Bobby Witt.
[42:57.880 --> 42:58.700]  I swallowed the gum.
[42:58.720 --> 42:59.380]  I was a kid.
[42:59.420 --> 43:00.300]  I hated this guy.
[43:00.620 --> 43:01.220]  Oral Hershey.
[43:01.660 --> 43:02.400]  Why'd you hate him?
[43:02.420 --> 43:02.700]  Me too.
[43:03.180 --> 43:06.460]  Because he fucking single-handedly destroyed the athletics.
[43:06.580 --> 43:09.540]  Yeah, because he was an absolute monster as a pitcher.
[43:09.760 --> 43:10.440]  Bruce Benedict.
[43:11.360 --> 43:13.000]  I think he's an announcer now, isn't he?
[43:16.060 --> 43:17.040]  It's just crazy.
[43:17.160 --> 43:18.500]  His name is Oral Hersheiser.
[43:18.600 --> 43:19.400]  Oral Hersheiser.
[43:19.700 --> 43:21.580]  Like, you name your kid anything.
[43:21.900 --> 43:22.080]  Yeah.
[43:22.440 --> 43:23.360]  You can name your kid anything.
[43:23.440 --> 43:23.800]  Anything.
[43:23.980 --> 43:24.380]  Anything at all.
[43:24.380 --> 43:26.000]  And you said, Oral.
[43:26.380 --> 43:27.080]  You know what I heard today?
[43:27.120 --> 43:27.480]  Speed it.
[43:27.640 --> 43:27.980]  Speed it.
[43:28.080 --> 43:28.920]  Name your kid anything.
[43:29.300 --> 43:30.780]  I was listening to another podcast.
[43:30.920 --> 43:33.000]  I'll mention it because it's in no way a competitor to us.
[43:33.380 --> 43:34.080]  It's called Who Weekly.
[43:34.320 --> 43:36.020]  It's one of my celebrity podcasts.
[43:36.440 --> 43:41.220]  And they were talking today about Kiefer Sutherland has seven fucking names.
[43:41.860 --> 43:42.240]  How do you mean?
[43:43.020 --> 43:44.080]  Look up Kiefer Sutherland's full name.
[43:44.540 --> 43:45.280]  And then read it.
[43:48.860 --> 43:49.220]  Kiefer.
[43:49.440 --> 43:50.560]  Also, his name is Kiefer.
[43:52.140 --> 43:53.320]  Is that his first name?
[43:53.360 --> 43:53.960]  Or is that just in the middle of it?
[43:53.960 --> 43:54.420]  It's his first name.
[43:54.440 --> 43:55.140]  I guess we'll find out.
[43:55.180 --> 43:55.640]  It's his first name.
[43:56.300 --> 43:57.400]  Kiefer Sutherland's full name.
[43:57.500 --> 43:57.960]  Are you ready?
[43:58.300 --> 43:58.760]  Go for it.
[43:59.360 --> 43:59.720]  Kiefer.
[44:00.760 --> 44:01.120]  William.
[44:02.100 --> 44:02.440]  Frederick.
[44:03.440 --> 44:03.800]  Dempsey.
[44:04.700 --> 44:05.060]  George.
[44:06.100 --> 44:06.480]  Rufus.
[44:07.280 --> 44:07.660]  Sutherland.
[44:08.460 --> 44:08.880]  Seven names.
[44:09.240 --> 44:11.480]  Do you think it's because his dad was like, I grew up with Donald?
[44:11.880 --> 44:11.980]  Yeah.
[44:12.100 --> 44:18.820]  So his dad, they were speculating, his dad, he named him after all of, like, four of those
[44:18.820 --> 44:21.800]  names are last names of directors that he liked.
[44:22.320 --> 44:22.440]  Yeah.
[44:22.660 --> 44:22.920]  Wow.
[44:23.560 --> 44:29.200]  Of all of those names, Kiefer is his first name.
[44:29.300 --> 44:30.780]  He could be out there going by Dempsey.
[44:30.880 --> 44:32.460]  He could be William Sutherland.
[44:32.620 --> 44:32.780]  Yeah.
[44:32.860 --> 44:34.060]  He could be Frederick Sutherland.
[44:34.060 --> 44:35.360]  Could be Rufus Sutherland.
[44:35.500 --> 44:39.360]  He could be George Sutherland, Rufus Sutherland, or Dempsey Sutherland.
[44:39.580 --> 44:41.300]  In fact, he is Kiefer.
[44:42.360 --> 44:46.700]  Also, there was a story behind every name except Rufus.
[44:46.780 --> 44:48.660]  His dad won't tell him why he named him Rufus.
[44:48.740 --> 44:49.780]  He's never told that story.
[44:50.080 --> 44:52.140]  So Kiefer Sutherland, he knows what the other names are.
[44:52.160 --> 44:53.620]  He has no idea what Rufus came from.
[44:53.820 --> 44:54.140]  Weird.
[44:54.280 --> 44:56.220]  You know, they're all pretty normal names though.
[44:56.260 --> 44:58.100]  You know who's got an absolute mouthful of a name?
[44:58.300 --> 44:59.180]  Oh, wow.
[44:59.260 --> 45:00.120]  They're already made.
[45:00.340 --> 45:00.620]  They're already made.
[45:00.620 --> 45:01.200]  Oh my God.
[45:01.260 --> 45:02.640]  Tony has mocked them up.
[45:02.640 --> 45:03.480]  Are we going to show?
[45:03.760 --> 45:04.300]  Go ahead.
[45:05.260 --> 45:06.000]  Show it.
[45:06.260 --> 45:06.740]  Show it.
[45:06.940 --> 45:07.360]  Tony...
[45:07.360 --> 45:07.640]  Oh, no.
[45:08.100 --> 45:08.320]  Get off.
[45:08.340 --> 45:10.140]  Tony has mocked it up.
[45:12.520 --> 45:13.020]  Wow.
[45:13.140 --> 45:14.720]  It's a couple of sticks.
[45:16.560 --> 45:18.040]  Okay, we have to make these.
[45:18.280 --> 45:18.440]  Yeah.
[45:18.800 --> 45:20.720]  These are approved.
[45:23.720 --> 45:29.180]  You know who's got a hell of a name that is a bunch of random names that aren't normal names?
[45:30.000 --> 45:30.500]  Dido.
[45:30.500 --> 45:32.400]  Oh, yeah.
[45:33.480 --> 45:33.960]  Dido.
[45:34.220 --> 45:36.420]  I don't know, but it's a real mess.
[45:36.540 --> 45:37.780]  I heard about this on Stern.
[45:37.980 --> 45:45.020]  I was listening to an old Howard Stern and they were making fun of a Jack FM call thing or whatever.
[45:45.800 --> 45:47.080]  And they did this.
[45:47.540 --> 45:52.360]  Florian, Cloud, Debonaville, O'Malley, Armstrong.
[45:52.700 --> 45:53.540]  That's a hell of a name.
[45:53.740 --> 45:54.680]  That's Dido's name?
[45:54.820 --> 45:55.300]  Dido!
[45:55.740 --> 45:58.360]  If Dido and Kiefer Sutherland got married, it would be insane.
[45:58.380 --> 45:59.420]  That would be awesome.
[45:59.880 --> 46:04.000]  Didn't Ron Howard give all of his children the middle name of where they were conceived?
[46:04.640 --> 46:05.280]  I think so.
[46:05.280 --> 46:06.880]  It's like Bryce Dallas Howard.
[46:07.620 --> 46:10.240]  You know what else is fucked up about the Kiefer Sutherland thing?
[46:11.800 --> 46:15.840]  He's got like four or five brothers and sisters and some of them don't have middle names.
[46:16.560 --> 46:17.180]  That's awesome.
[46:17.740 --> 46:20.880]  He has two brothers that Donald didn't give middle names to at all.
[46:21.200 --> 46:21.960]  His first and last name.
[46:24.540 --> 46:25.780]  Paige Carlisle Howard.
[46:26.460 --> 46:27.480]  Is Carlisle a place?
[46:27.480 --> 46:29.660]  It must be.
[46:30.940 --> 46:32.060]  Bill Doran.
[46:32.420 --> 46:33.180]  Does it taste like gum?
[46:33.460 --> 46:33.660]  No.
[46:34.180 --> 46:35.660]  Reid Cross Howard.
[46:35.740 --> 46:36.480]  Is it gone? Did you swallow it?
[46:37.100 --> 46:38.800]  I swallowed the piece that I bit off.
[46:39.260 --> 46:40.200]  Little nip.
[46:40.580 --> 46:41.960]  Paul Gilgus.
[46:43.080 --> 46:44.200]  Mike Young.
[46:46.220 --> 46:46.780]  Farb.
[46:46.800 --> 46:47.220]  Bill Bean.
[46:47.360 --> 46:47.860]  Ricky Kuhl.
[46:47.960 --> 46:48.720]  Darren Jackson.
[46:49.160 --> 46:49.680]  Willie Wilson.
[46:49.960 --> 46:51.220]  And Buddy Bell.
[46:51.640 --> 46:52.600]  Buddy Bell?
[46:53.280 --> 46:54.660]  That's not a good photo of Buddy Bell.
[46:55.160 --> 46:55.420]  Oh!
[46:55.420 --> 46:55.920]  Oh, Ryan Sandberg.
[46:56.040 --> 46:57.840]  Maybe we should have like an alliteration pile.
[46:58.020 --> 46:58.840]  Ryan Sandberg.
[46:59.100 --> 46:59.780]  Danny Duffy.
[47:00.140 --> 47:01.380]  Ryan Sandberg is...
[47:01.840 --> 47:02.960]  He's one of the boys of Zimmer.
[47:03.780 --> 47:04.120]  Oh!
[47:04.660 --> 47:05.820]  We should be collecting the boys.
[47:05.840 --> 47:06.540]  That's what he thinks.
[47:06.920 --> 47:08.900]  How old is Buddy Bell in that photo?
[47:09.240 --> 47:09.640]  Who was the other one?
[47:09.640 --> 47:10.140]  Is he playing?
[47:10.300 --> 47:10.800]  Billy Bean.
[47:11.840 --> 47:12.880]  Who was the other one you said?
[47:14.620 --> 47:15.760]  How old is...
[47:15.760 --> 47:16.400]  Buddy Bell.
[47:17.540 --> 47:18.940]  Well, he looks like he's about 48.
[47:20.480 --> 47:21.160]  Let's see.
[47:21.420 --> 47:22.200]  Oh, he's... yeah.
[47:23.060 --> 47:24.700]  It says he was born in 1902.
[47:27.280 --> 47:30.700]  I was going to say he either looks like 80 or like a terrible 40.
[47:30.980 --> 47:34.020]  So this is... he's... you're not going to believe this.
[47:36.360 --> 47:36.960]  Oh, no.
[47:36.980 --> 47:37.760]  That's his draft date.
[47:37.820 --> 47:38.860]  That makes way more sense.
[47:41.080 --> 47:45.420]  He was born in 1951 and this is 1989.
[47:46.140 --> 47:47.300]  So what is that?
[47:47.740 --> 47:48.060]  38?
[47:48.360 --> 47:48.580]  Yeah.
[47:49.760 --> 47:51.040]  That's a rough 38 years.
[47:51.280 --> 47:51.480]  That's true.
[47:52.860 --> 47:54.080]  You don't know if that's good.
[47:54.120 --> 47:54.600]  I just want to keep it going.
[47:57.380 --> 47:58.180]  No Zimmers.
[47:58.360 --> 47:59.060]  We got no Zims.
[47:59.840 --> 48:00.140]  We're Zimless.
[48:00.380 --> 48:00.820]  We're Zimless.
[48:00.940 --> 48:02.140]  Continue our Zimless streak.
[48:02.200 --> 48:02.760]  That's okay, though.
[48:03.520 --> 48:09.820]  Maybe we'll get lucky in this pack of Tops Archives Baseball.
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.300]  Okay, so what grade are these?
[48:11.340 --> 48:12.400]  Are these like bad also?
[48:12.500 --> 48:13.220]  These are also bad.
[48:13.360 --> 48:13.840]  They're slight...
[48:13.840 --> 48:14.700]  I'll tell you what they are.
[48:14.840 --> 48:16.420]  They're one step up from this.
[48:16.560 --> 48:17.980]  Stop buying bad cards.
[48:18.460 --> 48:18.820]  Doo-doo.
[48:19.080 --> 48:19.300]  Doo.
[48:19.720 --> 48:21.120]  Why do you buy the bad cards?
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.020]  Because they were there.
[48:23.780 --> 48:25.380]  Wow, is that really what this is?
[48:25.560 --> 48:25.620]  Yeah.
[48:25.780 --> 48:27.140]  You just really went...
[48:27.140 --> 48:27.940]  Desperate for...
[48:27.940 --> 48:28.340]  I'm telling you.
[48:28.580 --> 48:29.460]  You take what you can get.
[48:29.880 --> 48:30.840]  Also, there's still...
[48:30.840 --> 48:33.940]  I mean, even the bad stuff, there's still opportunities for fun, good shit.
[48:34.300 --> 48:35.600]  So do we not find a Zim in here?
[48:35.720 --> 48:37.040]  I found a Boys of...
[48:37.040 --> 48:39.020]  The Boys of Zimmer card that I got is from here.
[48:39.520 --> 48:40.360]  Oh, okay.
[48:40.500 --> 48:41.260]  So maybe we'll get another one of those.
[48:41.280 --> 48:42.040]  I got two of them already.
[48:42.200 --> 48:44.900]  I hope we learn more about the year something came out.
[48:46.080 --> 48:46.660]  We'll see.
[48:48.780 --> 48:49.820]  And it's possible...
[48:49.820 --> 48:52.020]  You know, there's probably more Zimmer packs in here.
[48:52.020 --> 48:54.700]  Are you putting something in the sack pack?
[48:59.680 --> 49:02.620]  So Archives, is that from any era of baseball, I'm assuming?
[49:02.760 --> 49:03.320]  That's what that means?
[49:04.080 --> 49:11.640]  So what this is going to be is mostly current MLB players in classic Cops designs.
[49:12.140 --> 49:12.380]  Okay.
[49:13.160 --> 49:16.080]  Similar to how Heritage was, honestly, but these are a little nicer.
[49:16.300 --> 49:16.800]  All right, here we go.
[49:16.840 --> 49:20.220]  And it's going to be mostly current players, but some old players as well.
[49:20.280 --> 49:22.020]  Are you excited to see these old classic designs?
[49:22.520 --> 49:22.720]  Yeah.
[49:22.720 --> 49:23.780]  Okay, let's see it.
[49:23.980 --> 49:24.460]  Wow!
[49:25.560 --> 49:27.320]  It's just a fucking photo.
[49:27.660 --> 49:28.740]  Mark McGuire.
[49:30.620 --> 49:31.720]  Here's Chris Bryant.
[49:31.880 --> 49:34.940]  That's 83 tops, I think, is what that's from.
[49:35.060 --> 49:35.640]  Did he sign yet?
[49:35.840 --> 49:36.880]  Joe Morgan.
[49:38.080 --> 49:39.040]  Adrian Beltre.
[49:39.640 --> 49:40.700]  Oh, that's fun.
[49:41.240 --> 49:42.980]  Andrew McCutcheon is Uncle Larry.
[49:44.740 --> 49:50.060]  That's an homage to one of the funniest baseball cards of all time, which is that image, but not behind a fucking blue sky.
[49:50.140 --> 49:50.640]  I'm going to save that.
[49:50.860 --> 49:51.140]  Cool.
[49:52.200 --> 49:52.920]  Ted Williams.
[49:53.280 --> 49:53.600]  Nice.
[49:53.980 --> 49:54.660]  Brain in a jar.
[49:56.120 --> 49:58.280]  San Diego Freeway, named after him.
[49:58.500 --> 49:58.740]  Wait, what?
[49:58.920 --> 49:59.200]  George Springer.
[49:59.440 --> 50:00.860]  He's a San Diego guy.
[50:01.060 --> 50:03.740]  When he died, they kept, they froze his head.
[50:04.660 --> 50:05.020]  Why?
[50:05.800 --> 50:06.740]  Because they're going to bring him back.
[50:07.260 --> 50:07.380]  Okay.
[50:07.820 --> 50:08.340]  That's the goal.
[50:08.340 --> 50:09.080]  Just his head, though?
[50:09.660 --> 50:15.700]  Well, I mean, I think what they're hoping is by the time they can bring the head back, he'll be able to be a whole human man.
[50:15.880 --> 50:16.740]  You know what I mean?
[50:16.760 --> 50:18.120]  Instead of being just a head.
[50:18.120 --> 50:21.480]  It would be like in The Wiz, when the, not The Wiz, Return to Oz.
[50:21.620 --> 50:22.660]  It would be like in The Wiz.
[50:22.900 --> 50:25.300]  No, it's Return to Oz, where she puts the new heads on.
[50:26.360 --> 50:27.720]  Yeah, just like that.
[50:27.820 --> 50:28.360]  Just like that.
[50:28.580 --> 50:29.440]  Is that the movie with TikTok?
[50:29.820 --> 50:29.980]  Yeah.
[50:30.240 --> 50:31.040]  Brent Rooker.
[50:32.040 --> 50:34.860]  And the wheelies, which are like the most terrifying thing.
[50:35.120 --> 50:42.220]  I saw that movie on my birthday, and the film broke. And 15 minutes in, the fucking film broke, and they made us go home.
[50:42.640 --> 50:47.540]  And we got tickets for the next weekend, so I had to go back and finish it the next weekend.
[50:47.540 --> 50:50.540]  And so my birthday party got delayed a week.
[50:50.780 --> 50:51.160]  Didn't that suck?
[50:51.220 --> 50:52.720]  They just said, fuck you, leave?
[50:52.860 --> 50:55.360]  Yeah, they were like, alright, here's your comps for next week. We can't fix it.
[50:55.480 --> 50:56.880]  All your friends went home too?
[50:57.200 --> 50:58.120]  Like my three friends, yeah.
[50:58.200 --> 50:59.060]  You didn't go and do something else?
[50:59.280 --> 51:03.400]  We probably did, but we had to go back to the movies the next weekend. I was so fucking heartbroken.
[51:04.160 --> 51:06.260]  You're like, I wonder how that movie starts.
[51:08.400 --> 51:13.020]  Ernie Banks. That's 91 tops, I believe. We have those Zimmer cards.
[51:13.100 --> 51:13.500]  Pretty cool.
[51:13.620 --> 51:14.340]  Joey Bart.
[51:15.480 --> 51:16.180]  That's a rookie.
[51:18.300 --> 51:21.040]  Gary Sanchez. I feel like that's a common name, Gary Sanchez.
[51:21.220 --> 51:23.620]  Oh, here we go. Nolan Ryan.
[51:24.020 --> 51:24.160]  Nice.
[51:25.820 --> 51:29.160]  The classic A's. The classic A that is the Angels.
[51:29.180 --> 51:34.020]  I thought he was doing this with his hand and someone was sat on it, but it's just another man behind him.
[51:34.200 --> 51:34.940]  Oh, shit!
[51:35.280 --> 51:35.640]  What's up?
[51:35.840 --> 51:36.600]  So that one last.
[51:37.540 --> 51:38.260]  Trey Mancini.
[51:38.460 --> 51:38.800]  Alright.
[51:39.760 --> 51:40.620]  You're gonna love this one.
[51:40.660 --> 51:41.000]  Okay.
[51:41.220 --> 51:42.840]  You don't know who this is. You're gonna love this one.
[51:42.920 --> 51:44.180]  As a baseball fan, you're gonna love this one.
[51:44.180 --> 51:44.300]  Okay.
[51:44.960 --> 51:45.640]  Kyle Schwarber.
[51:46.220 --> 51:48.220]  On card auto.
[51:48.460 --> 51:48.700]  Got it.
[51:50.500 --> 51:51.140]  John Crook.
[51:51.480 --> 51:57.820]  Oh! That's a good one! That's a fucking cool. That's a very cool one.
[51:58.380 --> 52:03.520]  That is not as good. That is not as good as my Najee Harris, but it's not far enough.
[52:03.720 --> 52:10.140]  John Crook. Classic weirdo. Classic. Classic baseball weirdo.
[52:10.180 --> 52:11.200]  That's better than the Horn brothers?
[52:11.580 --> 52:11.840]  Yes.
[52:11.840 --> 52:13.040]  In terms of value?
[52:13.480 --> 52:13.720]  Yeah.
[52:13.740 --> 52:14.400]  Yeah, I could...
[52:14.400 --> 52:16.260]  Does he still do, like, commentators and stuff?
[52:17.120 --> 52:18.560]  With who? ESPN, probably?
[52:18.560 --> 52:20.680]  I think it was ESPN. Time to give the dog his medicine.
[52:20.700 --> 52:21.680]  Yeah, give the dog the medicine.
[52:23.620 --> 52:28.840]  It happens. It happens when we're recording. It happens all the time.
[52:29.620 --> 52:30.920]  Dude, that's a major, for real...
[52:30.920 --> 52:32.680]  That's a good one, man.
[52:32.860 --> 52:33.440]  Major fucking hit.
[52:33.440 --> 52:34.960]  I take back what I said about the shit cards.
[52:35.260 --> 52:39.920]  I talk a lot about the difference between on card and sticker autos, but it's massive, and that's...
[52:40.700 --> 52:41.760]  On card is way more valuable?
[52:41.760 --> 52:42.460]  Way more valuable.
[52:42.720 --> 52:43.820]  John Crook is, like...
[52:43.820 --> 52:44.740]  Hall of Famer.
[52:44.800 --> 52:44.940]  Yeah.
[52:45.220 --> 52:45.620]  Hall of Famer.
[52:45.860 --> 52:46.140]  Wow.
[52:46.940 --> 52:49.860]  He looks like a man who owns no less than seven trucks.
[52:50.080 --> 52:53.620]  Oh, John Crook is, like...
[52:53.620 --> 53:00.020]  He was that classic 90s baseball guy, where he's, like, big fat guy.
[53:00.200 --> 53:00.420]  Yeah.
[53:00.820 --> 53:02.480]  Who, like, they don't let play baseball anymore.
[53:02.600 --> 53:03.900]  He's like the John Daly of baseball.
[53:04.300 --> 53:08.300]  You know how when you watch old movies, they let ugly people be in movies?
[53:08.760 --> 53:10.960]  John Crook is that for baseball.
[53:10.960 --> 53:11.240]  Yeah.
[53:11.340 --> 53:12.660]  And that has gone away now.
[53:12.800 --> 53:12.880]  Yeah.
[53:13.000 --> 53:13.780]  And that's sad.
[53:13.920 --> 53:14.300]  It is sad.
[53:14.320 --> 53:14.760]  Because he was awesome.
[53:15.020 --> 53:15.600]  Supremely ugly?
[53:15.680 --> 53:16.740]  Yeah, they just let...
[53:16.740 --> 53:20.000]  They let normal people be in movies.
[53:20.260 --> 53:21.180]  And they don't do that anymore.
[53:21.500 --> 53:22.520]  They don't let normal people...
[53:22.520 --> 53:22.620]  Sure.
[53:22.620 --> 53:23.520]  You have to be good looking.
[53:23.660 --> 53:23.860]  Yeah.
[53:23.860 --> 53:24.540]  And it sucks.
[53:25.060 --> 53:26.060]  Bring back normal people.
[53:26.180 --> 53:26.920]  And he was great.
[53:27.140 --> 53:27.340]  Yeah.
[53:27.440 --> 53:28.060]  Oh, he's awesome.
[53:28.260 --> 53:29.020]  He was an awesome player.
[53:29.020 --> 53:29.300]  Great baseball player.
[53:30.720 --> 53:31.520]  Alex Karoloff.
[53:31.720 --> 53:34.680]  I doubt we'll get anything worth a damn after pulling that card.
[53:34.680 --> 53:35.920]  Dude, John Crook's 60.
[53:36.140 --> 53:37.080]  Ron Santo.
[53:37.240 --> 53:37.420]  Wow.
[53:37.420 --> 53:37.840]  Is he really?
[53:38.000 --> 53:38.380]  Dude.
[53:39.380 --> 53:41.100]  Johnny Bench looking young and smart.
[53:41.800 --> 53:43.340]  Is he holding five baseballs or whatever?
[53:43.720 --> 53:44.560]  Have you guys ever seen that?
[53:44.680 --> 53:44.800]  Yeah.
[53:45.020 --> 53:45.740]  It's disgusting.
[53:45.980 --> 53:52.300]  He's the only person in history that I'm aware of that can hold five baseballs in one hand.
[53:52.460 --> 53:53.100]  That's crazy.
[53:53.300 --> 53:53.680]  His hand's so big.
[53:53.700 --> 53:54.260]  Here's one.
[53:55.260 --> 53:56.700]  Oh, I bet one between...
[53:56.700 --> 53:57.000]  Ow.
[53:59.020 --> 53:59.900]  Andres Menez.
[54:00.120 --> 54:01.340]  That happened so fast.
[54:01.400 --> 54:02.400]  Nick Madrigal.
[54:02.500 --> 54:03.080]  White Sox rookie.
[54:03.780 --> 54:04.400]  Dave Winfield.
[54:04.400 --> 54:04.980]  He's not doing...
[54:04.980 --> 54:07.080]  He's holding...
[54:07.080 --> 54:08.360]  His hands are massive.
[54:08.360 --> 54:09.100]  Zach Greinke.
[54:09.220 --> 54:10.220]  Oh, Luis Robert.
[54:10.460 --> 54:10.860]  Zach Greinke?
[54:11.040 --> 54:11.180]  Cool.
[54:12.460 --> 54:14.360]  Zach Greinke might be my favorite...
[54:15.620 --> 54:16.100]  Non...
[54:16.100 --> 54:16.360]  Andre?
[54:17.020 --> 54:19.760]  Yeah, like my favorite pitcher in baseball.
[54:20.320 --> 54:21.400]  Big-time weirdo.
[54:21.620 --> 54:21.880]  Really?
[54:22.120 --> 54:23.500]  Oh, big-time weirdo.
[54:23.520 --> 54:24.340]  Tell some Zach Greinke stories.
[54:24.340 --> 54:30.000]  He had a contest with another pitcher when he was on the Brewers to see who could throw
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.120]  the slowest pitch of the season.
[54:32.460 --> 54:32.860]  He won.
[54:33.300 --> 54:35.160]  When he was getting called up to the majors...
[54:35.160 --> 54:37.340]  Is his slowest pitch faster than my fastest pitch?
[54:37.420 --> 54:37.820]  Yes.
[54:37.820 --> 54:39.520]  It was 54 miles an hour.
[54:40.080 --> 54:43.680]  When he was getting called up to the majors, he was the number one prospect in baseball.
[54:43.800 --> 54:45.340]  He was getting called up to the majors as a pitcher.
[54:46.260 --> 54:51.100]  He was getting called up and he went and met with his manager and said, hey, instead of
[54:51.100 --> 54:56.040]  calling me up, can you send me back to single A and I'll start over as a shortstop?
[54:56.220 --> 54:57.680]  And they said, no.
[54:57.820 --> 54:59.100]  And he went, okay.
[54:59.360 --> 55:00.420]  That was it.
[55:01.780 --> 55:02.220]  Why?
[55:02.500 --> 55:03.720]  Because he's weird.
[55:03.960 --> 55:05.140]  Because he wants to bat.
[55:05.280 --> 55:06.740]  Because he's just a classic weirdo.
[55:07.460 --> 55:09.940]  Is that the slowest a pitch can be?
[55:10.240 --> 55:15.200]  They call it an Ephes pitch, which is like a Hebrew word that means nothing.
[55:15.980 --> 55:22.960]  So he throws like a curveball or just he throws a pitch that just goes...
[55:22.960 --> 55:24.760]  My fastest pitch means nothing.
[55:24.940 --> 55:26.160]  My fastest pitch is less than nothing.
[55:26.800 --> 55:28.080]  Have you improved there?
[55:28.440 --> 55:30.800]  No, because I haven't trained at all.
[55:30.860 --> 55:33.820]  Because I'm in a tremendous physical pain, discomfort thing.
[55:34.540 --> 55:35.100]  What a shock.
[55:35.100 --> 55:36.940]  The body is disintegrating.
[55:37.060 --> 55:37.560]  A shock.
[55:37.980 --> 55:39.420]  I can't believe it.
[55:39.640 --> 55:41.140]  Listen, I mean, this is all covered in fuckface.
[55:41.440 --> 55:42.800]  You got a month and a half.
[55:44.140 --> 55:45.380]  X-rays come back today.
[55:46.240 --> 55:47.460]  X-rays come back today.
[55:48.120 --> 55:49.200]  Don't worry, audience.
[55:49.300 --> 55:50.680]  X-rays come back today and then we'll see.
[55:51.520 --> 55:52.400]  Nelson Cruz.
[55:52.820 --> 55:53.080]  Nice.
[55:53.460 --> 55:54.480]  Nate Pearson rookie.
[55:54.680 --> 55:55.380]  I'll take that.
[55:55.800 --> 55:58.300]  He looks terrified, Nelson Cruz.
[55:58.440 --> 56:00.720]  He looks like he's blowing a Zerbert.
[56:01.440 --> 56:02.440]  He's like...
[56:03.140 --> 56:05.200]  Like he's motorboating the air.
[56:05.540 --> 56:06.160]  Is that this?
[56:07.880 --> 56:08.600]  Pretty cool.
[56:08.880 --> 56:09.040]  How's it?
[56:09.880 --> 56:10.460]  Oh, shit!
[56:10.680 --> 56:11.040]  There you go.
[56:11.120 --> 56:11.940]  Jay Cronenworth rookie.
[56:12.080 --> 56:12.440]  Hey!
[56:12.580 --> 56:13.980]  You should definitely hang on to that one.
[56:14.160 --> 56:14.520]  Absolutely.
[56:15.880 --> 56:16.600]  Garrett Crochet.
[56:17.600 --> 56:20.000]  Oh, here's a nice, I think, year two or three card.
[56:20.060 --> 56:20.640]  Walker Bueller.
[56:20.840 --> 56:21.360]  Oh, nice.
[56:21.540 --> 56:21.860]  Oil.
[56:22.120 --> 56:22.400]  That's nice.
[56:23.020 --> 56:24.460]  If he keeps it up, man, he's gonna have a good career.
[56:24.640 --> 56:24.700]  Yeah.
[56:24.780 --> 56:25.500]  I hate him.
[56:25.620 --> 56:26.360]  Yeah, yeah.
[56:26.980 --> 56:27.420]  Don't blame me.
[56:28.200 --> 56:30.160]  Nolan Arenado and Zach Allen.
[56:30.160 --> 56:31.980]  I also hate Nolan Arenado.
[56:33.300 --> 56:34.080]  You hate a lot.
[56:34.320 --> 56:35.820]  Yeah, well, you know.
[56:35.860 --> 56:36.160]  It's okay.
[56:36.520 --> 56:37.160]  You know, baseball.
[56:38.420 --> 56:39.840]  That's part of the joy of baseball.
[56:39.960 --> 56:40.080]  Yeah.
[56:41.500 --> 56:44.060]  Manny Machado, always just runner up for a gold glove.
[56:44.220 --> 56:45.400]  So what's gonna happen with the strike?
[56:45.520 --> 56:46.040]  With the lockout?
[56:47.140 --> 56:47.740]  No idea.
[56:47.900 --> 56:49.180]  Are we gonna start a season on time?
[56:49.340 --> 56:49.900]  It's great.
[56:50.040 --> 56:54.800]  There's a baseball subreddit where a guy's just drawing Mike Trout every day until the baseball strike is lifted.
[56:54.980 --> 56:57.260]  And it's like if Andrew decided to start drawing.
[56:57.480 --> 56:58.460]  Like, it's so bad.
[56:58.460 --> 57:01.600]  I wonder if it's gonna be so long the guy's gonna become a brilliant artist.
[57:01.600 --> 57:03.220]  Yeah, because you just see it like regressively.
[57:03.340 --> 57:04.160]  It's just really good.
[57:04.760 --> 57:05.560]  Bob Gibson.
[57:06.080 --> 57:06.520]  Hey, alright.
[57:07.060 --> 57:07.860]  Corey Seeger.
[57:09.780 --> 57:10.580]  Here's a...
[57:10.580 --> 57:11.240]  Louis Patino.
[57:11.340 --> 57:13.300]  That is a hard yellow to fucking see.
[57:14.500 --> 57:15.300]  German Marquez.
[57:15.960 --> 57:16.820]  Oh, I love these cards.
[57:16.880 --> 57:17.700]  There's a Lindor card.
[57:17.860 --> 57:18.240]  I love that style.
[57:18.240 --> 57:18.940]  Oh, that's a cool one.
[57:19.200 --> 57:19.820]  That's a classic.
[57:19.820 --> 57:20.220]  I don't know what that's from.
[57:20.280 --> 57:21.420]  That's from like the 50s maybe.
[57:22.700 --> 57:23.360]  I don't know.
[57:24.940 --> 57:25.740]  Colton Wong.
[57:26.200 --> 57:26.560]  Kyle Henderson.
[57:26.560 --> 57:28.960]  This is one of the ugliest baseball cards ever made this year.
[57:29.040 --> 57:29.580]  It's...
[57:29.580 --> 57:29.840]  I hate it.
[57:29.900 --> 57:31.060]  It's like 96 maybe, 95.
[57:31.160 --> 57:31.700]  Really dark.
[57:32.220 --> 57:33.500]  Reese Huskins.
[57:34.520 --> 57:35.060]  Then...
[57:35.060 --> 57:36.720]  He looks...
[57:36.720 --> 57:38.820]  Something horrible has happened on the field.
[57:39.880 --> 57:43.060]  That is the face of like a lion has rushed the field.
[57:43.300 --> 57:45.040]  Like that is not a baseball thing.
[57:45.220 --> 57:45.720]  He's got...
[57:45.720 --> 57:47.400]  Oh my god, it's a lion face.
[57:47.860 --> 57:48.480]  Save that.
[57:49.340 --> 57:50.260]  I'll remember that.
[57:52.310 --> 57:53.560]  Here we go, Bryce Harper.
[57:54.460 --> 57:55.960]  Here we go, Justin Turner again.
[57:55.960 --> 57:56.420]  Alright.
[57:57.000 --> 57:58.420]  Here we go, the big unit.
[57:58.620 --> 57:59.160]  Randy Johnson.
[57:59.500 --> 57:59.680]  Yeah.
[57:59.740 --> 58:00.380]  The bold killer.
[58:00.740 --> 58:02.780]  You just put three of the same person there.
[58:10.380 --> 58:12.160]  You just like watched them age.
[58:12.740 --> 58:14.180]  Okay, well we'll save those.
[58:14.300 --> 58:14.760]  That's funny.
[58:15.660 --> 58:16.340]  Oh man.
[58:16.460 --> 58:18.900]  I have all these ideas of what I want to do with these...
[58:18.900 --> 58:20.080]  With the little series that we're making.
[58:20.180 --> 58:20.320]  Yeah.
[58:20.880 --> 58:22.100]  We'll get into that in 2022.
[58:22.320 --> 58:23.580]  I want to wait until we have a permanent set.
[58:23.580 --> 58:24.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[58:24.640 --> 58:25.420]  Really blow it out.
[58:25.420 --> 58:27.420]  Also, speaking of which, I was going to talk about.
[58:27.960 --> 58:30.420]  I think we're at our best when we're working with the community.
[58:30.640 --> 58:33.080]  With the comment leavers and the regulation listeners on stuff.
[58:33.540 --> 58:35.220]  And so, I had this idea...
[58:35.220 --> 58:35.920]  Well, I didn't have the idea.
[58:36.000 --> 58:37.040]  I think Andrew had the idea.
[58:38.040 --> 58:38.760]  Forever ago.
[58:38.900 --> 58:41.040]  And we may have mentioned it at the very onset of this.
[58:41.420 --> 58:45.720]  But Andrew was making fun of this Marcus Smart card I have.
[58:45.800 --> 58:46.580]  Because it's a towel.
[58:46.960 --> 58:48.460]  It's called Tools of the Trade.
[58:48.680 --> 58:50.440]  And it's a little fabric of towel.
[58:52.300 --> 58:55.780]  And I think it was Andrew's idea that we should make the Infinity Towel.
[58:55.920 --> 59:02.280]  Where we collect little swatches of towel cards from NBA players all across the globe.
[59:03.060 --> 59:06.640]  And then we stitch it together and make the Infinity Gauntlet of towels.
[59:06.820 --> 59:09.200]  It's like LeBron, Michael Jordan, Marcus Smart.
[59:09.320 --> 59:09.880]  A complete tool.
[59:09.880 --> 59:10.380]  Kevin Durant.
[59:10.920 --> 59:12.300]  A complete tool.
[59:12.600 --> 59:13.660]  A complete tool.
[59:14.160 --> 59:17.600]  So, if the audience wants to work with us to collect these and send them in.
[59:17.760 --> 59:19.780]  We'll stitch together the Infinity Towel.
[59:19.780 --> 59:22.080]  I guarantee you.
[59:22.180 --> 59:24.260]  I guarantee you comment leavers.
[59:24.540 --> 59:26.280]  I guarantee you regulation listeners.
[59:26.280 --> 59:28.180]  And I guarantee you f*** facers.
[59:28.660 --> 59:30.440]  If we make the Infinity Towel, we'll get on ESPN.
[59:30.580 --> 59:31.280]  I will say.
[59:31.660 --> 59:34.820]  If you have a towel piece that you want to send.
[59:35.160 --> 59:36.520]  You can send it to f*** face.
[59:38.440 --> 59:42.260]  1901 East 51st Street, Austin, Texas 78723.
[59:42.820 --> 59:43.740]  We can get it there.
[59:43.920 --> 59:46.060]  Just make sure you write f*** face on it.
[59:46.160 --> 59:48.280]  And then maybe put care of Geoff Ramsey.
[59:48.380 --> 59:49.040]  Because I don't want to deal with it.
[59:49.040 --> 59:51.780]  And don't send anything valuable that you don't want to get ruined.
[59:51.900 --> 59:53.040]  No, we don't want to like...
[59:54.640 --> 59:57.740]  We're just trying to complete this Infinity Towel project.
[59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.540]  Send anything in that you want to be sewed to something else.
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.240]  You're not getting it back.
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.580]  So, if you have to pay more than shipping for it.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.460]  Oh, classic.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.100]  Juan Gonzalez.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.060]  Great player.
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:09.800]  Freddie Freeman.
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:10.300]  Cool.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.760]  Let's see if he signs anywhere.
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.960]  That's a good chin size.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.180]  Good chin size?
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.020]  Yeah, that's a pretty...
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:17.040]  He's a...
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:17.580]  That's a solid chin.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.660]  And he's also got a...
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:19.120]  He's got a...
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.420]  He's got a little dent it too.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.680]  He's the kind of baseball player you could look at.
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.360]  Like your dad would look at and be like...
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.660]  That's a handsome man.
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:26.660]  And you'd be like, really?
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:27.940]  Yeah, and you'd go...
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:28.160]  Yeah.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:29.220]  He's dad handsome.
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:29.660]  He is.
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:29.900]  Yeah.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:30.600]  100%.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.460]  Dads think he's handsome.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:31.760]  Yeah.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.360]  He's like a square-headed white guy.
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.620]  And dads go, handsome man.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.580]  Matt Chapman.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.620]  He looks like he's about to host Ridiculousness.
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.100]  He's a Deer Deck lookalike.
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.260]  Hey, what's going on?
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:44.580]  Pee Wee Reese.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.560]  You're going to be wondering...
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.560]  You're going to have to look back through these to see what you saved.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.660]  I was...
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.900]  I had an idea that I was going to keep a spreadsheet with all this.
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:52.080]  Yeah.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:53.840]  And then it was like, I'll do it after episode one.
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.280]  Then I was like, I'll do it after two, after three.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.880]  I'm going to be miserable when I finally sit down to do it.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:58.660]  We're so far into this.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:00:59.820]  Dylan Carlson, rookie.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:00.840]  Take that.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.740]  I'm getting an intern and they can help.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.380]  But also, I don't want to subject them to this.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.240]  Why not?
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:06.600]  It just seems like...
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.000]  All right, sit down and watch us open cards.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:08.580]  And then write...
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.780]  These three guys look like the same guy.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.300]  You look lovely over there.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:14.760]  How are you doing?
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.200]  I'm good.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.080]  I zoned out for a minute.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.460]  It's okay.
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:19.420]  You're not missing anything.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.000]  I was thinking about people sending you guys towels.
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.900]  And it kind of grossed me out a little bit.
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.420]  Only if they're game used.
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:27.780]  Yeah.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:28.660]  Is it gross?
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.140]  Yeah, right.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:29.700]  That makes it better.
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.780]  I pulled this out of the pack sack.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:32.560]  Got lucky.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:33.720]  I didn't actually look for this one.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.280]  I just pulled it out.
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.140]  1991, Tops Major League Baseball.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:38.020]  I believe...
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:38.540]  This could be Zim.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  This is a Zim year.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:41.960]  You want some gum?
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:43.040]  I'm good.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:43.540]  All right.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.580]  You spinning the wheel of Zim?
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.400]  Oh, no.
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:46.860]  I'm sorry.
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:47.820]  It's...
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:48.760]  Oh, no.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:49.520]  Oh.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:50.720]  Oh.
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.680]  You, like, went for it.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:55.320]  Like, you put it in, like, your back teeth and chomped.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.800]  Like, you shouldn't have done that.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.020]  Ew.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.180]  Oh, what is happening?
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.060]  Well, I was going to throw it in there.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:01.780]  You deflated yourself.
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:02.740]  I was going to throw it in there.
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:04.740]  And then I remembered that her present is in there.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.860]  And I don't want to get gum on it.
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.720]  So I'm sucking it up.
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.220]  Enjoy that shirt, by the way.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:10.440]  Yeah.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.540]  I'll get to it after I get out of the trash.
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.880]  I can't stay in my mouth.
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:18.960]  Where's my shirt?
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:19.520]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.720]  Geoff, thank you for spinning all you want.
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:23.900]  All right.
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:24.940]  Mark Williamson.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.140]  Howard Anderson.
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:27.900]  Kenny Rogers.
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:28.560]  All right.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.040]  Roaston.
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.340]  Mel Rojas.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.000]  George Bell.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:34.840]  Michelle.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:36.880]  Smith.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:37.480]  Was that a mullet?
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.140]  Was that a good mullet?
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.000]  I feel like he just had the...
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:40.200]  Yes, that's a mullet.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.520]  I was trying to figure out how many bats he had on his chest.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:43.800]  Is it the most bats we've seen?
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.500]  He's a two...
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:46.220]  He's a two-bat chess man.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.600]  Brian Smith.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.040]  Dwayne Henry.
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:53.420]  Not the best photo of Willie McGee I've ever seen.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:58.520]  George Brett.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:02:59.800]  Dave Reigetti.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:01.380]  Craig Grabeck.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.060]  That's a high leg.
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.200]  That's a very high leg.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.180]  That is a very high leg.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:04.720]  Good call, good call.
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:05.080]  High leg.
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:06.780]  Craig Grabeck.
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:07.280]  Tim Drummond.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.020]  I'm glad you guys are here.
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:08.700]  I forget this stuff.
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:09.040]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:10.440]  Another boy of Zimmer, I believe.
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:12.500]  Andre Dawson.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:16.500]  And then Dion James looking unimpressed.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.620]  He is upset to be in this pack.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.780]  He's looking at the rest of those cards.
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:22.740]  He's not happy to be there.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:23.900]  Yeah, I agree with you on that one.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:24.680]  You're putting me with who?
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.640]  That's terrible.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:27.900]  That shit is still so much in my mouth.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:28.960]  It lasts.
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:29.380]  It lasts forever.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:29.920]  Yeah, the gum is terrible.
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.080]  It's the taste that keeps on racing.
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:33.000]  Diet Coke?
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:33.760]  I have some Diet Coke.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:37.520]  You really put your mouth on that.
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:38.680]  Yeah, I'm into it.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.080]  Did you see that?
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.260]  He like sticks out his tongue first.
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:41.540]  He goes...
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:42.320]  Did you see that?
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.420]  Like his upper lip was like all the way...
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.040]  I would do it, but I don't want to turn like a gif of me doing it.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.160]  You like went for it.
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:50.960]  I needed it.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:51.840]  It's like a little...
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.140]  You don't put your lip past that.
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:54.020]  You put yours like all the way there.
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:55.880]  Hold on, let's see how you drink and then we'll see how I drink.
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.400]  I'll fucking criticize you.
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:58.060]  Smart.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.100]  You drink very beautifully.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.040]  Let's see a Geoff one.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:02.660]  Yeah.
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.060]  That's what it looks like.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.540]  There's no...
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.520]  I don't drink like that.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.440]  Andrew couldn't believe it.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:09.760]  There's no way.
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:12.900]  Nobody does that.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.380]  No, you're right.
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:15.000]  Nobody does that.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:15.580]  I don't either.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.840]  I'm just using a can opener.
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:23.960]  His lips are all cut.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.320]  Sorry, I've been drinking a lot of soda.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.720]  Let's open up some Tops 2021 Chrome.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.060]  Stick with it.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.080]  Baseball's been so fun.
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:37.020]  So good to us today.
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.060]  We'll keep it up.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.500]  And also, I would love to open more UFC if I had it.
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.360]  You putting some of those in the sack pack?
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.500]  Yeah, I'll put one in.
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:46.380]  Now I'm just surrounded by trash.
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.540]  Top pack goes in the pack sack.
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:48.740]  Well, you put all the trash there.
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:49.300]  I know.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:53.860]  I was trying to get my present out to show my present that's available now at store.roosterteeth.com.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:54.280]  Very nice.
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.480]  We sure it would be cool if you bought it, but only if you like it.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:58.660]  But why wouldn't you like it?
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.960]  I'm so excited for the wow.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:04.100]  Yeah, let us know in the chat if you're interested in buying a stick.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.040]  If that's something you would purchase.
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:07.540]  Yeah, please let us know.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:08.580]  I think...
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:09.720]  Man, I think they're gonna be hot.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.740]  Can we just make garbage and sell it?
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:12.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:12.920]  It's trash.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.320]  It's not useful.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:18.060]  You are the worst salesman of all time.
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.360]  I'm just trying to be honest.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:20.180]  When you're not...
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:20.840]  Honest?
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.840]  There's nothing honest about telling people a metal sign is made of plastic.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.360]  When we found out, I texted and went, this is metal.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.880]  And Gavin just replied, I'm so bad at my job.
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:33.400]  Someone said it was plastic.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.720]  I didn't know what was going on.
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:36.900]  Eduardo Escobar.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.340]  Miguel Cabrera.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.560]  This is a lovely Jake Arrieta photo.
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:45.940]  Ooh, here's a sepia Devin Williams.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.040]  I don't know who that is, but it's a nice parallel.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.140]  Was that all that was in there?
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.080]  Yeah, you only get four cards in these guys.
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:56.080]  Wow, jeez.
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:57.880]  God knows that was a...
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.560]  That's wild.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.840]  Goes quick, because it's chrome, man.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:00.800]  It's expensive.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:01.580]  I didn't realize.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.320]  Luis Garcia.
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:02.840]  Yeah.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:03.580]  Luis Garcia.
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.120]  Uh, Chris Davis.
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.780]  Ooh, look at that.
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.120]  Dylan Carlson.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.700]  Like a shimmer parallel rookie.
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:15.260]  That's nice.
[01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:16.340]  Look at that.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.240]  Dylan Carlson.
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.440]  He's okay, too.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:20.780]  He could have a career.
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:23.060]  Randy Rosarino.
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:24.720]  Future star from the future.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.980]  Did he not win rookie of the year?
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.180]  He did win rookie of the year, didn't he?
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:32.060]  Yeah, even after being in the postseason the previous year.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.220]  Even though he had, like, yeah, one of the best postseasons ever.
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:34.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.280]  Hit, like, nine home runs.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:41.440]  I feel like if you're on that card, you have to at least hit one ball with a giant star wrapped around you.
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.240]  You think, oh, you're a practical effects guy.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:45.920]  I get it.
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:49.280]  I'm thinking of the CG in baseball cards.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.540]  Patrick Korman.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:51.620]  Uh, here we go.
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:52.220]  Bobby Dalbeck.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:53.600]  That's not bad.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.600]  That's a weird picture for a swing.
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.720]  It's just, like, it's done.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.300]  Yeah, right?
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:06:59.160]  Like...
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:06:59.520]  Yeah.
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:00.500]  It's just so done.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.040]  I want to see the moments where these photos were taken.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.400]  Like, are these all game?
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.340]  Are these within games?
[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.080]  Are these practices?
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.920]  You think they go out there and pretend to play a game?
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.180]  Well, like, I don't know if it's a practice or not.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.780]  You're like, all right, Marcel, I'm gonna throw the ball to you.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.280]  You catch it.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:13.720]  Look cool.
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:14.580]  Yeah.
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:15.620]  Maybe.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.940]  I mean, what situation would they not be...
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:20.060]  Why wouldn't you try and grab them at a real game, Andrew?
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.840]  Because, let's say you're doing training camp or whatever.
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.760]  I don't know what, like, the rules are in their contracts.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:25.480]  I just...
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:26.540]  It's more from my perspective.
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:30.540]  It'd be cool if you could see the moment that the card was taken a photo of.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:30.960]  You know what I mean?
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.940]  So you want a card...
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:34.940]  Like if someone took a picture of the person taking a picture of the card?
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.040]  No, no, no, no.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:39.800]  Like, let's say, like, a better version of an NFT where, like,
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.500]  if you look at the back of that card, they'll be like,
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.900]  it's this game on this date.
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:43.660]  You can watch this.
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:44.980]  Or, like, a link to watch...
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:45.000]  Oh!
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:46.660]  Oh, I do...
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:47.680]  See, I do like that.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.160]  I do like that.
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.040]  It wasn't what you explained, but I do like that.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.600]  No, I did it horrendously, but that is the point I was trying to say.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.240]  I just feel like there's so many people taking pictures at a real game
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.260]  that you might as well use those.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:58.520]  Yeah.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.940]  There's no reason to stage it.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.580]  I've never seen this parallel.
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:02.920]  What'd you get?
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:03.260]  This is interesting.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.700]  This is a Venezuela Ronald LaCugna Junior card.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:07.040]  Oh, cool.
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:08.160]  It's, I guess, baseball.
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:08.760]  Baseball.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:09.720]  That's cool.
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:10.160]  It's parallel.
[01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:13.740]  And then he followed that up with another where he's like...
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:14.060]  Oh, wow.
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:14.960]  It's like he's doing...
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.520]  He's like...
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.240]  Oh, I thought it looked...
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.120]  I think he's coming to, like, a full stop.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:19.520]  Yeah, he is.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.400]  It looks like he's running and going, like,
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.280]  and everything's sort of...
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.300]  Yeah, that's a cool card.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:25.600]  Did he break his leg?
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:26.200]  Is that what happened?
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.000]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:27.960]  And then he was out for the rest of the season?
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.140]  That sucked.
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.580]  And then they won everything.
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:33.900]  Won 88 games and then the World Series.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.040]  88 games.
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:36.380]  It was awesome.
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.460]  Jesus Sanchez.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.180]  That's a rookie card.
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.060]  All right.
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:44.780]  Oh, that's another high leg.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.460]  Very high leg.
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:47.040]  Incredibly high leg.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.480]  He managed to get his leg over the trophy.
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.500]  He lifted higher than the trophy.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.520]  I mean, the guy who was designing that card went,
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:54.380]  and this goes right?
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:54.880]  Yeah.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.880]  I believe that was the previous marker for highest leg.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.620]  I broke the record!
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:02.840]  Nick Magical rookie.
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.240]  See, now, I agree with Andrew where he's talking about,
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:06.480]  I want to see the game that that's from,
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.640]  because I wonder if he catches that ball.
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:08.620]  Exactly.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.240]  And then...
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.180]  Like a what happened next sort of situation.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.440]  Sepia, David Dahl.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.240]  Because I would love to see the card that looks cool,
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.520]  but, like, they didn't make the play.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.140]  Or it was, like, an error during the second.
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:22.080]  Did you see earlier when I got that Naji Harris jumbo auto?
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.860]  I've never had a jumbo patch auto.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:24.420]  That's insane.
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:25.260]  And it's his rookie, too.
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:26.060]  And it's a rookie, too.
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.120]  I mean, I have a couple of Marcus Smart jumbo patches.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:28.480]  Marcus Smart?
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:29.180]  Marcus Smart.
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:32.080]  I don't have...
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.660]  I've certainly never pulled one.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:34.080]  That's what we wanted.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.260]  That's a huge pull.
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:36.460]  You like Marcus Smart?
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.160]  I have an entire wardrobe of Marcus Smart buttons.
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:43.800]  I don't wear them all the time,
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:45.320]  but I have, like, six Marcus Smart shirts now.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.440]  Third baseman for the Angels?
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.120]  Marcana.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.000]  Like, Snell.
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:53.520]  Andres Menez again.
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:54.640]  What year is this from?
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.180]  This is this year.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.820]  No, it's not.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.180]  This is Tops 2021 Crown.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.340]  Wait, Snell's a Padre.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:03.180]  He wasn't a...
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.240]  He was at the top on the other deck.
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:07.460]  You want to file some sort of appeal?
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.220]  No, I just think...
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:09.140]  I was wondering what year it is.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.060]  Is our complaint number on the record?
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:14.540]  It probably was produced before he got traded or left to go to...
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:14.900]  Oh, okay.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:15.640]  Very weird.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.820]  I mean, it was in the offseason.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:17.420]  Very strange.
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:18.620]  Could...
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.940]  Is that the...
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:20.640]  Could I see that again?
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:21.280]  Yeah.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.660]  It's not a very high-ranked pick.
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:26.980]  I've never seen anyone look more devious when playing the pitch.
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.220]  Like, it looks like he's got a real scheme going.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.020]  You should watch some Blake Snell stuff.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.400]  He, like, streams on Twitch.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:33.740]  He's a real...
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.540]  He's, like, a real weird guy.
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:36.440]  He's, like, a weirdo.
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:37.340]  Yeah, he's cool.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:38.780]  Carlson rookie.
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:41.600]  He got, like, pissed off at his rating in the video game.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.160]  And then he had a terrible...
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.240]  And then he had a terrible season.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.760]  Oh, is this a...
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.980]  Noah Sundegaard.
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:51.080]  And then Xander Bogarts.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.100]  Hey, great.
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.040]  That's a good baseball name.
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:53.300]  Yeah.
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:58.160]  Like, there's nobody in the background in the Sundegaard card.
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:10:59.320]  Like, is that a real...
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.620]  Is that just what the attendance is?
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.200]  It's just out of focus.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:02.620]  Is there?
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.140]  Okay.
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:04.660]  I can't see anybody.
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.820]  I can't make out distinct faces.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:09.640]  Pretty cool.
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:10.440]  I didn't see any bodies.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.120]  This guy.
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.720]  We got about ten minutes left.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:16.300]  I do have a few...
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:16.720]  Let's see.
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:17.280]  Let's switch out.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.040]  Let's take a baseball break.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:19.360]  Okay.
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:21.420]  Let's open up another fucking...
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:22.620]  Here we go.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.020]  We'll do these.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:23.280]  Okay.
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:24.900]  First off...
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:25.000]  Yeah.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.360]  Because I got to get them out of my life.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.320]  Oh, you're doing these again.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:30.600]  We're going to do another pack of F1 doo-doos.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:31.260]  Oh, F2.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:32.320]  Yeah.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:32.880]  Or F2.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:33.740]  Oh, shit!
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:40.380]  Fucking Lewis Hamilton, 2007 F1 rookie flashback, 65 defense, 75 attack.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:40.800]  Dang.
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:41.900]  That's his rookie...
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:42.960]  Those are his rookie numbers, too.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:43.640]  You know he gets better.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.340]  He gets 75 attack and the principal gets three?
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:46.680]  Yeah.
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:47.420]  Wow.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:48.660]  He's very strong.
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.200]  In his car.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.940]  David Beckham.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:52.920]  Classic.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.060]  Classic F1 guy, David Beckham.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:57.040]  Marcus Armstrong.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:57.940]  I've never heard of these people.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.080]  These must be F7.
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:00.120]  Oh, there you go.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:00.900]  Sergio Perez.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:02.160]  They probably do, like, Formula E.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:05.240]  He's a 73 defense, 83 attack.
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:05.840]  Wow.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:06.820]  That's more than Hamilton.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.180]  Daniel Ricciardo, 78 defense, 86 attack.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:10.940]  Yeah, but what...
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.260]  Who's he racing for in that one?
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:12.800]  He's not Red Bull.
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:13.820]  He's racing for McLaren.
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:14.420]  Here we go.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.400]  Do a shoo-ee for this.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.520]  Now we'll open up some Absolute Football.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.000]  See if we can continue our rookie luck.
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:24.500]  Hell yeah.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:25.980]  These are pretty decent cards.
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:26.520]  I had to go to...
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:33.260]  Well, tip, if you want to buy these cards, they sell them and only them at sports author...
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:33.720]  What is it?
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.280]  Academy Sports.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:34.640]  Academy.
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:35.500]  Oh, interesting.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:36.320]  Gotta go to Academy.
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:38.740]  I went to go buy baseballs at Academy Sports and they didn't have any.
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:39.620]  Are you serious?
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.680]  They didn't have any baseballs.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.240]  When I went to buy the gloves for our throw, I got them at Academy and they had, like,
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:44.860]  four gloves.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:45.420]  Yeah.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:45.860]  Oh, yeah.
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:46.540]  It's...
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:46.900]  I don't...
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:47.340]  It's crazy.
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:47.880]  It was crazy.
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:49.180]  Where did you get baseballs from in the end?
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:50.400]  I didn't.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.620]  You just didn't get any?
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.820]  We just didn't get baseballs.
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.740]  We have some, but...
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:55.340]  Do you have five?
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:56.320]  Yeah, we got five.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.440]  Can you fit them in one hand?
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:58.060]  Yeah, no.
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.060]  Samuel.
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:00.900]  I just got hit with...
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:01.340]  Another Diva?
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:03.640]  Explosive.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:04.100]  I need to poop.
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:05.740]  Teddy Bridgewater.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.480]  Brian Tannehill.
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.420]  And there will not be time until...
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:10.440]  I gotta get Millie from Squask.
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:11.420]  Explosive.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.020]  I'm gonna have to wait.
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:13.040]  Oh, it's gonna be bad.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.820]  That's what it sounds like.
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:18.600]  She lives with me, so...
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:19.420]  John Taylor.
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:20.880]  Derrick Carr.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.200]  Cam Newton.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.820]  Here is a green parallel.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.440]  Miles Barrett.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.720]  There's Thomas Kelsey.
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:30.360]  Oh, here's a Jarrett Peterson.
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:34.480]  Najee Harris by storm.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.000]  Rookie card.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:35.500]  That's cool.
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:36.220]  We'll insert...
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:36.940]  Hi there.
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:40.000]  Mike Evans Red Zone.
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:40.800]  Oh, I gotta...
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.500]  Oh, poop cramp.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:43.220]  Yeah.
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.220]  Poop cramp.
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.220]  That noise is gonna make it happen.
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:48.500]  That is what it sounds like in the morning.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:49.260]  Do it again.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.220]  It's like wet at the end like that?
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:58.380]  Yeah, it's like I get ready like next to the bathroom door, like where he is, and I can hear it through the wall.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:13:59.860]  And I'm not shy at all.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:00.140]  Through the wall.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:00.580]  Yeah.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:01.980]  I was like, what?
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:08.320]  Just so you know, Tony sent this.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:09.680]  The order's already going in.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:10.460]  Oh my God.
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:11.840]  So we gotta figure this out.
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:13.220]  We gotta sell these fucking things.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:14.720]  Hopefully...
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.120]  Guys, you gotta buy the fuck sticks.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:16.860]  You have to buy...
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:17.880]  You gotta buy the sticks.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.500]  You have to buy the sticks that go...
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.420]  We're gonna get...
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.780]  They're gonna shut us down.
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.480]  What's the minimum order for...
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.580]  Mar Geofferson rookie, Chauncey Galston.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.240]  Just a bunch of rookies I've never heard of.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.860]  I'll save this for last.
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:37.380]  This is...
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:38.440]  I had to buy these online.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.060]  I think this was like...
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:40.960]  It was pretty expensive, too.
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:42.860]  I think I paid like 60 bucks or something.
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:43.500]  Wow!
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:44.360]  How much is it normally?
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:45.200]  I don't know.
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:46.900]  2019 Optic.
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:47.560]  I don't know.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.240]  Last year's Optic.
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:51.080]  But we have a little bit of time.
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.800]  What if we opened...
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.260]  Tell you what.
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:55.500]  What if we opened another James Bond?
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:56.100]  Wow!
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:58.740]  End on a dench?
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.320]  You think we can double dench?
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:01.180]  Oh, you know what?
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:04.260]  There's the guy from one of the other cards whose last name was Bench.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:05.920]  We should put dench on a bench.
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:07.040]  A dench on a bench.
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:08.420]  We should end with dench.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.060]  Dench on a bench.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:09.920]  Dench on a bench.
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:11.600]  Well, in that case, well, we can.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.680]  Or a bench on a dench.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.140]  That would be really different and cool.
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:15.860]  Well, we'll start with this.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:16.680]  I pulled this from the pack sack.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:18.180]  I don't think we're going to find that, but I hope we do.
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:19.920]  This is Terminator 2 Judgment Day.
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:23.360]  I think Emily and I bought these in West Texas somewhere.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:25.780]  Who are you hoping to get?
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:26.780]  Terminator 2.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:27.340]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.300]  Oh, his friend from the beginning.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:32.960]  The kid who was Budnick in Salute Your Shorts.
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:33.960]  Redhead kid.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.340]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:35.600]  Is that Ryder Kylie?
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:37.980]  No, that's...
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.420]  That's a different kid, but the same show.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.260]  What Terminator wants.
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:46.320]  That sounds sexy.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.800]  I don't think that's true.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.860]  I feel like he's failed technically in every movie.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:51.860]  Yeah, honestly, he doesn't ever get what he wants.
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:53.900]  Did he want to melt to death at the end of the first movie?
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.140]  That's why I gave the thumbs up.
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:56.880]  I want this.
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:57.920]  Oh, these are all little stories.
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:58.860]  Terminator feed...
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.100]  Oh, look at this.
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.240]  He doesn't even get his fucking name on the card.
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.160]  This is embarrassing.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:06.100]  The James Cameron card, it just says Terminator creator.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:10.820]  Dude, how come they don't have that for baseball?
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:16.460]  They should have Adventure of Baseball in just like a card of like a guy from like 1884 or whatever.
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:19.440]  James Cameron doesn't get his fucking name on the front of the card.
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.040]  That's cool.
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:21.140]  Jesus Christ.
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.420]  Terminator and John infiltrate Pescadero.
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.260]  Is his name Terminator?
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:30.840]  Yeah, his name is officially Terminator.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.880]  The gun points right at the audience.
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.300]  It's T. Erminator.
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:38.500]  The real Sarah Connor seals her fate.
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.000]  Was he like a T-800?
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:40.860]  He's a T-100.
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:41.680]  T-100?
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.040]  Hunting for John.
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.580]  Robert Patrick was the T-1000.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.620]  Speaking of Robert Patrick as the T-1000, there he is, ready to cruise.
[01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:54.620]  Total Route.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.060]  Didn't he get into some money troubles with Tony Soprano?
[01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:00.700]  Yeah, with Tony and a couple of his friends, yeah.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.900]  But he moved. He's fine. He lives in Nevada now.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.400]  He works on a ranch. And then Vegas is right there, so it's all good.
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:09.800]  Nothing to worry about.
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.060]  Terminator searches for John.
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.700]  His son's furious, but...
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.280]  What the fuck is this?
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:17.840]  Oh, it's an offer.
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:21.020]  If you want to buy a collector's pen and pencil set,
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.000]  you just fill out this fucking form and pay $6.95.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:24.840]  Wow.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:26.580]  We should do this.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.640]  We should send this off and see what comes back.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:29.760]  Yeah.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:31.520]  Nothing's gonna...
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:33.280]  Is there any, like, date on it?
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.200]  Is there a P.O. Box?
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:35.700]  1991.
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:39.320]  Good through December 31st, 1991.
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.980]  We got a digital watch card and a pen set.
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:43.320]  Yeah.
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:47.320]  T2 offer P.O. Box 1265, Churchill, Maryland.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:48.960]  Churchill, Maryland?
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.680]  I love the idea of replying to all these.
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:55.240]  Yeah, me too.
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:57.220]  Let me see that real quick.
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:58.260]  I'm just gonna see...
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:00.220]  Alright, we're gonna open up these expensive optics I bought,
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.140]  then we'll do James Bond.
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:01.460]  Hell yeah.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.160]  We'll try to dench bench, and then we'll call it a day.
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:09.140]  Fingers crossed we get something that was worth me spending the money I spent on these.
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.700]  Bruno Fernando rookie.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.800]  Not quite what I was looking for, but...
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.320]  He plays for the Celtics now.
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:17.860]  Thomas Bryant.
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:20.820]  Pascal Siaka, my house.
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:23.580]  Rajon Rondo in a Laker uniform.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.500]  Hurts every time I see it.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.660]  Yeah, that's painful.
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:28.120]  Really fucking painful.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:33.000]  I found Churchill, Maryland, but it doesn't look like this is gonna be there.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:36.780]  I don't know if he's great at Connect Four, but he's a fucking... he's kind of a genius.
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:37.620]  Churchill, Maryland.
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:39.320]  It looks like he's in the middle of nowhere.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:39.440]  That's interesting.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:40.740]  Like a thong.
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:45.060]  Dude, I just got a really kind of interesting Kendrick Nunn era card.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:45.400]  Yeah?
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.140]  What about it?
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.200]  What's the era?
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:50.000]  What's the, uh...
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:50.680]  Oh, there's no title.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.480]  Oh, there's nothing on it!
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:51.960]  It's got no name.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.960]  Is that like a valuable era?
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:54.600]  Maybe, yeah.
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.220]  They look like that.
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.980]  Here's Bruno Fernando's rookie card.
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.120]  We could fill it in.
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.960]  We could put Terminator Creator on it.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.380]  I'll take that, Bruno.
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:04.040]  That Kendrick Nunn card, that's cool.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.820]  Okay, Kyle Lowry.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:08.200]  Lowry.
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.460]  Kyrie Irving, fuck him.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:15.080]  Russell Westbrook when he played for the Houston Rockets.
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:23.320]  And not fuck Kyrie for the COVID stuff, although fuck him for that too, but fuck him for being a shitty Celtic.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.180]  Fuck him for lying to us.
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:26.200]  Fuck him for that commercial.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:31.100]  Fuck him for that commercial where he said, I'm gonna raise my fucking number to the Rafters in the Garden.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.040]  And then six months later left.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:35.760]  Romeo Lankford rookie.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.000]  It is impressive he did it in a packed arena, didn't he?
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.020]  Did he announce... I'm trying to remember that time.
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:41.920]  That's pretty cool.
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:42.780]  I think it was one of the first games.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.520]  He's like, I will be back next year.
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:45.740]  And he absolutely wasn't.
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:47.000]  DeAndre Ayton.
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:51.300]  I feel like DeAndre Ayton's not getting enough credit for what he does for that team.
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:54.320]  And I feel like he's getting a lot of criticism he doesn't deserve.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.720]  I also think he deserved a Macross contract.
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:56.880]  I don't know why they didn't give it to him.
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:57.660]  Poor guy.
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:19:59.140]  Pascal Siakam.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.300]  That looks like...
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:01.780]  Still his house.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.100]  It is his house.
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.300]  No, my house.
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:07.260]  My house.
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:07.780]  Mine.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:11.480]  And a Luka Doncic, which is worth money because it's Luka.
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.000]  There you go.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:12.360]  Great.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.280]  All right, now we'll open this extra pack.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.280]  This is gonna have the parallels in it.
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:18.780]  And then we'll open up James Bond.
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:21.700]  And then we'll go away for a month.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.400]  Do you still feel explosive or what?
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:24.300]  I feel pretty explosive.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:25.960]  Oh boy.
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:26.760]  That's how I feel.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.960]  Alan Crabb, who I don't even know if he's in the league anymore.
[01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:33.140]  Do you think we could make one with like people whose last names are animals?
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:33.860]  That's a good one.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:34.260]  Yes.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.120]  Ooh.
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.720]  Make like a whole like King of the Jungle kind of situation?
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:38.480]  Make like a zoo.
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.000]  Joe Ingalls, who is one of...
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.860]  I mean, if...
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:47.160]  And I don't mean this to be insulting, but if you're gonna have a white guy play for the Utah Jazz,
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.500]  Joe Ingalls seems like the guy.
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.780]  You know what I mean?
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:51.640]  He's the man.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.920]  He's that guy.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.600]  And then Thomas Bryan.
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:56.000]  Okay.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.660]  There's nothing crazy out of those.
[01:20:58.540 --> 01:20:58.900]  Alright.
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:00.280]  Did you say it was worth the money you spent?
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:01.500]  No.
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:02.180]  No.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:05.860]  Not unless that fucking Kendrick Nunn's worth something, but I doubt it.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:06.120]  Yeah.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:06.780]  Alright, here we go.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:07.960]  Let's see if we get a dench or a bench.
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.040]  Probably just the dench.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:10.760]  Probably just the dench.
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:11.000]  Lots of money.
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:13.000]  But if we see a bench, I'm gonna fucking flip.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.240]  Imagine we get an order of bench cards.
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.400]  James Bond is action staring.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:21.260]  Here we go.
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.300]  It's James Bond again.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:24.820]  That's a nice card.
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.400]  Andrew, do you think these are from training or from the movie?
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.520]  I'd say movie.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:32.460]  On that one.
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:33.540]  Yeah, confidently.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.580]  I do see people in the background of those cards.
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:36.720]  I can't see that.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:39.320]  It's like a spring training, but for film.
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:42.060]  Table Rehearsal?
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:43.380]  Table Rehearsal!
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.200]  Rehearsal!
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.460]  The Cactus League of Film.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:47.200]  Oh, here we go.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.440]  It's Goldeneye.
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:49.540]  It's Bean again.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:50.820]  And what's his face?
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:51.860]  Alan.
[01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:52.720]  Yeah, Alan.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.220]  I feel like we've seen this card before.
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:56.940]  Oh.
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:58.220]  This card.
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.500]  There is a zero dench.
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:00.560]  It's a denchless.
[01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:01.140]  Denchless.
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.040]  Wow.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:03.320]  Denchless.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.500]  Well, that's it.
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.120]  I guess that is our time.
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:10.740]  We did it, guys.
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:15.520]  What an amazing journey we all just went on together.
[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:16.640]  You got the Jumbo card.
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:17.100]  Whatever.
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:19.660]  We got the Jumbo Rookie Auto Patch card.
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:23.380]  We got a weird Kendrick Nunn card.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.200]  We got the Horn Brothers On Card Autos.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:26.900]  John Kruk.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:27.920]  We got John Kruk.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.100]  The John Kruk.
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:30.600]  We created new merchandise.
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:37.320]  We created and then placed an order for new merchandise.
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:44.000]  It's disturbing how quickly that went into place.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.860]  I'm very excited for next week when they go, okay, it's coming on this day.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.080]  And we go, what are you talking about?
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.460]  Frustratingly enough, I was really hoping to get through all these cards because they've been sitting at my house.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.400]  And I've just been dying to open them.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.520]  So now I've got to wait another fucking month to get to the rest of them.
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:03.700]  Is the next one in Jan?
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:04.400]  Yeah.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:05.820]  We'll find a date.
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:13.040]  Hopefully by then we'll get a table that we can kind of throw around and everything and make it happen.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.020]  I'm very excited.
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:15.120]  It'll be good.
[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:16.020]  All right.
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:21.000]  Well, thank you so much for tuning in and see you next time.
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.460]  Subscribe to the podcast.
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:22.900]  What?
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:23.780]  Oh, sorry.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:24.880]  Subscribe to the podcast.
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:25.160]  What?
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:26.460]  It's called F*** Face.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:27.600]  It's hard to find.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:28.060]  Pretty good.
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:30.580]  So if you do find it, subscribe because you might not find it again.
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:36.700]  Oh, and also, if you want to buy shit, we sell shit.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.860]  And it's mostly up in front of you.
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:40.360]  Was that Andrew or the soundboard?
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:41.300]  That was me.
[01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:42.140]  What did you do?
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.640]  I mean, the...
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.360]  Jimmy's head was turning.
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:49.920]  He's turning.
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:59.420]  What do you want?
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:00.480]  How long do you want?
[01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:06.840]  Violence.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:07.600]  Spin the wheel.
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:08.340]  Spin the wheel.
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:09.500]  Spin the wheel so it's in the center.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:16.460]  Let's get close up on this and we'll fade out with Andrew doing this.
