[00:00.000 --> 00:02.300]  I fucked up my back earlier in the week.
[00:02.600 --> 00:03.620]  Like, really, I...
[00:03.620 --> 00:05.560]  Yeah, that's a great... So, I woke up,
[00:05.900 --> 00:08.180]  my ribs hurt, my upper back hurt,
[00:08.240 --> 00:09.360]  just everything hurt.
[00:09.440 --> 00:12.120]  When I tried to move, it was not good. Breathing, not fun.
[00:12.220 --> 00:13.260]  Laughing, painful.
[00:13.420 --> 00:16.240]  I was thinking about it all day. Couldn't figure it out.
[00:16.600 --> 00:17.660]  I then mentioned to someone,
[00:17.720 --> 00:19.140]  yeah, I don't know what's wrong with my back.
[00:19.380 --> 00:21.360]  They said, didn't you fall the night before?
[00:21.720 --> 00:23.960]  I fell and I forgot. I was trying to figure out
[00:23.960 --> 00:25.540]  this mystery. I tripped.
[00:25.680 --> 00:27.800]  I fell as hard as maybe I've ever fallen
[00:27.800 --> 00:29.720]  in my house. It was no good.
[00:29.720 --> 00:31.260]  I cannot emphasize enough
[00:31.260 --> 00:33.980]  how hard I hit the fucking floor
[00:33.980 --> 00:35.640]  in my room.
[00:35.920 --> 00:37.040]  What caused you to fall?
[00:37.520 --> 00:38.340]  Okay, this is what...
[00:38.340 --> 00:41.820]  It was... I got very... I had to use the
[00:41.820 --> 00:43.460]  bathroom. I was doing my little shimmy
[00:43.460 --> 00:45.480]  to get there, because I have to shimmy through my room.
[00:45.700 --> 00:47.920]  And I stepped on...
[00:48.460 --> 00:48.980]  Laughing.
[00:50.120 --> 00:51.900]  I had knocked over a cabinet
[00:51.900 --> 00:53.860]  earlier in the day, and I didn't realize
[00:53.860 --> 00:55.740]  that I knocked over a
[00:55.740 --> 00:57.140]  plastic sushi container.
[00:57.140 --> 00:59.160]  So while I was doing my shimmy,
[00:59.440 --> 01:01.500]  my foot went in the sushi container.
[01:01.800 --> 01:03.140]  I did the splits,
[01:03.160 --> 01:05.300]  and I could do nothing but fall back.
[01:05.720 --> 01:07.000]  And I landed...
[01:07.000 --> 01:09.320]  You gotta clean your shit up.
[01:09.360 --> 01:12.020]  It's disgusting. You're slipping all over the place.
[01:12.440 --> 01:13.360]  You're slipping on
[01:13.360 --> 01:14.820]  old sushi, man.
[01:15.060 --> 01:16.920]  No, no, no. It was an empty container.
[01:16.960 --> 01:18.820]  It was perfectly clean. It was like the plastic
[01:18.820 --> 01:21.000]  portable case you would have. I'm very
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.040]  impressed that, you know, with your
[01:23.040 --> 01:24.480]  ankles, you didn't do more damage.
[01:24.480 --> 01:26.720]  You somehow got out of that without an ankle
[01:26.720 --> 01:28.740]  injury, and that's very impressive. Yeah, no kidding, man.
[01:29.100 --> 01:30.460]  Yeah, thankfully, no ankles
[01:30.460 --> 01:31.820]  were harmed in that fall.
[01:32.580 --> 01:33.760]  Stepping in a sushi bowl.
[01:34.200 --> 01:36.400]  Maybe we're ready for the marathon then. Yeah, I've been
[01:36.400 --> 01:38.420]  thinking about that. That's been on
[01:38.420 --> 01:39.200]  my mind, for sure.
[01:40.600 --> 01:42.520]  I'm recovering from a back injury at the
[01:42.520 --> 01:44.760]  moment, but as soon as the back injury is healed...
[01:44.760 --> 01:46.360]  I like the idea of you running a marathon when
[01:46.360 --> 01:48.300]  you struggle to move from
[01:48.300 --> 01:50.440]  bathroom to bedroom without stepping on
[01:50.440 --> 01:52.380]  sushi containers. Well, it's, you know,
[01:52.380 --> 01:54.340]  it's happened one time, and it only happened
[01:54.340 --> 01:56.480]  because I knocked something over earlier in the day.
[01:56.600 --> 01:58.420]  But you slipped over in the bathroom recently.
[01:58.600 --> 02:00.040]  Like, since F*** Face, you've
[02:00.040 --> 02:02.300]  eaten it straight forwards in the bathroom.
[02:02.880 --> 02:04.340]  Yeah, I did, but that was like I
[02:04.340 --> 02:06.500]  slid on my underwear, and then I
[02:06.500 --> 02:07.700]  just had to fall forward.
[02:08.600 --> 02:10.520]  There's nothing to grab. My only
[02:10.520 --> 02:12.420]  option was to grab the towel bar, and I would
[02:12.420 --> 02:14.380]  just fall with me. I'm not gonna take the
[02:14.380 --> 02:16.280]  towel bar out the wall with my fall, so
[02:16.280 --> 02:18.480]  I just had to land on my forehead. I like these split
[02:18.480 --> 02:20.380]  second decisions, like, I could grab
[02:20.380 --> 02:22.420]  that, but that would result in the towel bar
[02:22.420 --> 02:24.540]  coming down, potentially damaging. And this is all while
[02:24.540 --> 02:26.600]  you're falling, so you just throw your arms
[02:26.600 --> 02:28.500]  up, like, I'm going down! Yeah, no,
[02:28.600 --> 02:30.540]  it's very, I use that time
[02:30.540 --> 02:32.440]  wisely, Gavin. When I'm falling, I got
[02:32.440 --> 02:34.340]  a solid half-second of thought
[02:34.340 --> 02:35.320]  where I'm calculating.
[02:41.530 --> 02:42.750]  You ever wonder why we're here?
[02:47.150 --> 02:47.550]  Whoa!
[02:47.750 --> 02:49.410]  It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?
[02:52.130 --> 02:53.270]  Whoa, you wanna see
[02:53.270 --> 02:54.930]  where that clip's from, and
[02:55.450 --> 02:57.170]  all the other clips that you're gonna be seeing
[02:57.170 --> 02:59.430]  with the new F*** Face regulation animation?
