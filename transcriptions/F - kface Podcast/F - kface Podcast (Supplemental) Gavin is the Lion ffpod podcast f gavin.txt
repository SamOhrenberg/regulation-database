[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  We'll set up a GoPro on our faces, and then the other person will be on the other side of the door.
[00:06.800 --> 00:07.020]  Yes.
[00:07.200 --> 00:10.480]  And we'll film their reaction while we all listen through the door.
[00:10.800 --> 00:14.120]  Why don't we just put our heads through a hole in the wall?
[00:14.340 --> 00:16.420]  Why is there... where is there a hole in the wall?
[00:17.980 --> 00:18.940]  Like a guillotine?
[00:19.280 --> 00:23.060]  No, I like the idea. That's how they filmed the MGM Lion logo.
[00:23.900 --> 00:27.200]  That's why he's rolling in the logo. He's getting his arse waxed.
