[00:10.500 --> 00:15.260]  What are we doing, lads? What do you think we're doing? We're going to hit 350 baseballs.
[00:15.340 --> 00:21.520]  We? Uh, yeah. Well, see, I did the signature part. Yeah, looks good. So that's my signature.
[00:21.740 --> 00:28.440]  Yeah. So as long as that gets on a ball, I signed it. As long as that gets on a ball, it's signed.
[00:28.440 --> 00:31.400]  So what happens if he doesn't swing? Does that count as like, just a ball?
[00:31.720 --> 00:37.020]  Well, we do have... we have a couple more people coming, uh, so we could have a designated catcher
[00:37.020 --> 00:42.560]  who can toss the ball back. Right. You know what I mean? I think the important thing is the swing.
[00:42.840 --> 00:46.640]  Yeah, I feel like if I bought a ball that Geoff swung and missed, I'm fine with it.
[00:46.780 --> 00:50.860]  If he didn't even go for it, is that even... did that even leave the box?
[00:51.320 --> 00:54.820]  It's always interesting when you say something like three months ago and it's funny then,
[00:54.940 --> 00:58.060]  but then you're sort of wearing the outfit and you've got a bat in your hand and you think...
[00:58.060 --> 01:00.460]  You have to finish this thing to go to the other thing.
[01:01.920 --> 01:03.480]  Y'all give it a try?
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.460]  Oh, hey, honestly, I'm impressed. First pitch at the wall. That was wild.
[01:23.900 --> 01:26.840]  I cannot believe you did that. Oh my God.
[01:27.480 --> 01:27.880]  Jesus.
[01:30.260 --> 01:38.840]  Oh, yeah. It's, um... Oh my God. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay, so I do have paint brushes.
[01:39.380 --> 01:43.440]  Oh my God. Yeah, that's good.
[01:43.780 --> 01:50.120]  Spin me? There you go. Well, this is pretty much what I thought it was going to be,
[01:50.260 --> 01:54.820]  I'll be honest. All right, let's take the field and see what happens. This will be the first one.
[01:58.060 --> 02:01.800]  You want me to move it back or anything? No, let's go from here. Okay. All right, Eric.
[02:02.260 --> 02:06.840]  Okay, guys, this is it. First baseball. Geoff at the bat.
[02:16.190 --> 02:17.170]  That's a swing.
[02:25.320 --> 02:27.280]  How does it look? Is there black on it?
[02:27.360 --> 02:31.660]  Yeah, it's my signature right there.
[02:35.360 --> 02:41.560]  Oh my God. Whoa. Hey, Cole, welcome. Check out Geoff's signature. Yep, that's it.
[02:59.720 --> 03:01.260]  Every once in a while, I'm not lying.
[03:11.930 --> 03:12.950]  Isn't that the point?
[03:16.550 --> 03:19.330]  So, I don't know what happened with this one. It went like old Jackson Pollock.
[03:19.630 --> 03:22.690]  You got like a nine and a half. Oh, dude, that's a G. That's a G.
[03:26.510 --> 03:29.810]  These ones are just like where you see where you got the contact on it.
[03:32.870 --> 03:39.410]  It really worked. Yeah, that's insane. Oh, wait, no, it's a six. No, it's a G, dude.
[03:39.450 --> 03:40.870]  It's a lowercase G. No, I think it's a nine.
[03:41.910 --> 03:46.930]  Let's get a look at one of those home runs. Oh, man, if you get that one, that was a home run.
[04:04.790 --> 04:08.650]  My camera's gonna eat it. I don't care if it's epistacal to say, Gavin,
[04:08.650 --> 04:14.830]  I'm a goddamn genius. Really add something to it. A little bit of vegetation. A little bit.
[04:15.030 --> 04:16.050]  Went through the growth, overgrowth.
[04:38.520 --> 04:40.620]  Into like the middle of the trees.
[04:45.440 --> 04:50.160]  This camera's getting some good footage. These are all the ones that are...
[04:50.160 --> 04:53.280]  This is more swings than misses so far. And plus the
[04:53.280 --> 04:56.660]  home runs that Cole is trying to find. Plus probably one or two foul balls.
[05:16.650 --> 05:18.210]  Be careful, southwest.
[05:22.120 --> 05:24.380]  Yeah, during the next break, I'm going to order that lens again.
[06:03.900 --> 06:14.460]  Oh, my God.
[06:21.880 --> 06:23.660]  Eric, is there paint on the camera?
[06:26.720 --> 06:33.560]  Oh, no. Oh, it's so chunky down there. Oh, but it's on the lens.
[06:33.980 --> 06:39.900]  It's... Gavin, that's paint. That's like house paint. I filmed slow-mo guys with it.
[06:52.930 --> 06:57.150]  Oh, my God.
[07:20.020 --> 07:21.700]  We can sell that tripod. I signed it.
[07:42.360 --> 07:44.320]  You're not going to catch that.
[07:45.620 --> 07:46.500]  My God.
[07:47.160 --> 07:49.240]  What are the chances you hit my camera today?
[07:49.360 --> 07:52.280]  I hope. I got close, man. I got the tripod.
[07:52.700 --> 07:52.860]  Yeah.
[07:53.020 --> 07:54.960]  I got paint all over it.
[07:55.020 --> 07:57.300]  This has changed into a completely different game for you.
[07:57.300 --> 08:03.740]  Yeah, I mean, I proved that I can... I proved that I can swing like a motherfucker. I hit about...
[08:03.740 --> 08:06.520]  Dude, you crushed him out there. I did not expect this out of you.
[08:06.660 --> 08:07.780]  Nobody did. Nobody believes you.
[08:07.800 --> 08:10.640]  I walked up to him, I'm like, he's hit 10 over. I'm like, bullshit, he's hit 10 over.
[08:10.660 --> 08:12.240]  And then I watched him hit like 10 more.
[08:13.360 --> 08:15.020]  There were a couple of back-to-back ones, though.
[08:15.040 --> 08:18.420]  Yeah, yeah. My favorite is the two homers back-to-back and then there's a whiff.
[08:22.960 --> 08:24.720]  Dude, the paint coming off that.
[08:37.040 --> 08:43.540]  Well, Geoff, that's all of them. I wanted to go out with a homer.
[08:43.580 --> 08:44.400]  I already dodged her.
[08:46.560 --> 08:47.780]  That bruise there.
[08:50.920 --> 08:53.280]  If I didn't have carpal tunnel, I do now.
[08:54.560 --> 08:55.260]  Right here.
[08:56.380 --> 08:56.780]  Certainly.
[08:58.420 --> 08:59.920]  Oh my god, look how swollen it is.
[09:00.180 --> 09:01.080]  Yeah, well, you know.
[09:02.060 --> 09:03.200]  She's got a fat arm.
