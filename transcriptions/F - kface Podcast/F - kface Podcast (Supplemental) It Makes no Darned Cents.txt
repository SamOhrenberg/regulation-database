[00:00.000 --> 00:05.660]  Would you think it would be weird if you were to wake up every day and next to your desk there
[00:05.660 --> 00:09.880]  was a coin and the first thing you did when you got up every day was you picked up that coin and
[00:09.880 --> 00:15.820]  you flipped it and you called heads or tails and every day it was tails. And you started to get
[00:15.820 --> 00:20.660]  freaked out by it. So you would put a different quarter down and you threw the other quarter away
[00:20.660 --> 00:25.960]  and it was still tails every day. So you got a nickel and you tried that and it's still tails.
[00:26.200 --> 00:29.140]  So you take it outside and you throw it up in the air and you let it hit the ground. Still tails.
[00:29.140 --> 00:34.520]  Everything that you can do, the coin still flips tails. That's been happening to me with socks.
[00:35.600 --> 00:36.000]  What?
[00:37.820 --> 00:38.220]  What?
[00:38.980 --> 00:43.480]  I was about to make a Harvey Dent joke and then you switched it to socks.
[00:43.820 --> 00:48.860]  No, no, time out for a second. Have you not been flipping a coin every day of your life?
[00:49.300 --> 00:50.120]  Metaphorically, I have.
[00:50.560 --> 00:52.680]  What the fuck? What do you mean?
[00:53.140 --> 00:56.380]  And before you say it, you're gonna come up with lots of ways that I can test this and
[00:56.380 --> 00:58.080]  I'm gonna tell you I have an answer for every one of them.
[00:58.540 --> 00:58.940]  Okay.
[00:59.100 --> 00:59.480]  All right.
[00:59.540 --> 01:01.640]  I can't imagine how that applies.
[01:01.760 --> 01:08.260]  You're the only people I've ever spoken to about this. Every year, guys, 900,000 days in a row,
[01:08.360 --> 01:13.280]  maybe. I am at a point in my life. Socks now, they have a left sock and a right sock and they'll tell
[01:13.280 --> 01:18.620]  you right by the big toe there's an L and right by the other big toe there's an R. What happens
[01:18.620 --> 01:24.820]  to me is every day I sit down on my sofa or wherever and I go to pick up a sock and I instinctively
[01:24.820 --> 01:27.140]  pick up to put a sock on my right foot.
[01:27.140 --> 01:28.520]  I fucking hate this.
[01:29.100 --> 01:31.740]  I pick up every single time the left sock.
[01:31.800 --> 01:33.840]  Why did you do the coin story?
[01:34.860 --> 01:39.860]  Because it's the same thing. I've got a 50-50 shot of getting the left or the right sock.
[01:39.880 --> 01:40.940]  I know, but that still applies to the socks.
[01:40.940 --> 01:46.420]  Why is it only the left sock every time? I fold them differently. I mess them up.
[01:46.620 --> 01:50.560]  I can't not pick the left sock. Help me fix my problem.
[01:50.920 --> 01:52.240]  It was a great story.
[01:52.660 --> 01:55.840]  My point is, I think I'm living in a simulation.
[01:55.840 --> 02:01.020]  Every day at this moment it's like something sinks or reboots and I'm getting stuck with
[02:01.020 --> 02:03.020]  the goddamn left sock on my right foot.
[02:03.200 --> 02:04.940]  And I've done everything I can think of to do it.
[02:05.440 --> 02:09.260]  I've laid the socks out the night before and somehow I still end up with the left sock.
[02:09.800 --> 02:11.520]  And I always forget, right?
[02:11.760 --> 02:15.400]  Like I'm never like, I even think like one time I've even I've even left myself notes
[02:15.400 --> 02:16.320]  on my nightstand.
[02:16.880 --> 02:18.080]  Don't forget the sock thing.
[02:18.460 --> 02:22.280]  And what invariably happens is I'll get up and I'll go through the motions and the next thing I know
[02:22.280 --> 02:25.120]  I'm just sitting down with my left sock and my right foot.
[02:25.120 --> 02:26.140]  Every time.
[02:26.340 --> 02:27.260]  I can't see it coming.
[02:27.500 --> 02:28.480]  I can't predict it.
[02:28.720 --> 02:29.160]  I can't.
[02:29.240 --> 02:29.660]  I can't.
[02:29.700 --> 02:31.100]  I'm powerless to stop it.
[02:31.320 --> 02:33.840]  I've even I've even gone through periods where I'm like, fuck it.
[02:33.940 --> 02:34.820]  I'm just gonna tell the universe.
[02:35.100 --> 02:36.280]  I like it that way.
[02:36.400 --> 02:38.340]  I'm gonna put my left sock on my right foot.
[02:38.440 --> 02:39.080]  And I've done it.
[02:39.160 --> 02:40.020]  I've done it for months.
[02:40.260 --> 02:41.180]  Just despite the universe.
[02:41.180 --> 02:42.880]  Just despite and the universe doesn't care.
[02:43.060 --> 02:43.480]  It doesn't.
[02:43.560 --> 02:44.260]  There's no trick in it.
[02:44.360 --> 02:46.460]  It's still and I hate it.
[02:46.520 --> 02:47.580]  And I'm lying to myself.
[02:47.760 --> 02:48.440]  Here's what we'll do.
[02:48.740 --> 02:49.880]  I'm gonna buy you some gloves.
[02:50.220 --> 02:50.680]  We'll see.
[02:50.880 --> 02:52.240]  We'll see what happens with those.
[02:52.680 --> 02:53.240]  All right.
[02:53.500 --> 02:54.660]  And then I got to put on gloves every day.
[02:56.380 --> 02:56.820]  Whoa.
[02:57.040 --> 03:01.460]  You want to see where that clip's from and all the other clips that you're gonna be seeing
