[00:00.000 --> 00:04.340]  I thought I was losing my mind yesterday. I, uh, I got some new headphones,
[00:04.640 --> 00:09.300]  like AirPod sort of things, and, um, they're paired to my phone and I also paired them to my
[00:09.300 --> 00:15.600]  iMac where I edit stuff. And I was listening to the... I was proofing the next episode of F***face
[00:15.600 --> 00:21.500]  and if I pause something with the headphones and then resume it within a short amount of time,
[00:21.940 --> 00:26.420]  it just continues what I was doing. But I guess if I've used my phone too much in between or
[00:26.420 --> 00:32.280]  enough time has passed, for some reason it just decides I've given up on this connection to the
[00:32.280 --> 00:37.400]  phone. I'm now on the Mac. And what it was doing, and this is where I thought I was losing my mind.
[00:37.960 --> 00:45.540]  On my Mac, if you open like the music app, I guess it's what iTunes became. I never used the app,
[00:45.580 --> 00:51.500]  but what I had on there was a ringtone I just made, uh, which is like a little clip from my
[00:51.500 --> 00:55.520]  pinball machine. I just turned it into my ringtone. But to do that, I had to like put it through that
[00:55.520 --> 01:01.080]  music app and all that stuff. And then the next file down was some lines I had Dan record for
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.380]  some slow-mo video where I was having him pretend to be a robot. And, um, I guess when I tried to
[01:06.380 --> 01:12.980]  resume my, my phone playback of F***face, it decided, Hey, I'm controlling the iMac now.
[01:13.000 --> 01:20.460]  And it started playing my ringtone. So I was like, Oh, I'll get a call. So I double tapped the side
[01:20.460 --> 01:26.960]  of the AirPods to answer the call. But when no one's actually calling you, it just skips track.
[01:27.280 --> 01:33.160]  So it skipped to the next track, which was Dan going, Hey B. And I was like,
[01:34.060 --> 01:41.500]  Hey B? And because he was doing multiple takes, he just kept saying it in different
[01:41.500 --> 01:48.080]  like intonations. So he was like, Hey B. And I was like, uh, Hey B. And he was like, Hey B.
[01:48.080 --> 01:57.540]  And I was like, Hey B. And I'm just there in my freaking kitchen talking to audiophiles that
[01:57.540 --> 02:03.260]  are playing on my Mac in a different room. It took me, it took me about 45 seconds to realize
[02:03.260 --> 02:09.240]  I wasn't actually on the phone with Dan. It was like such a weird series of events. And I was
[02:09.240 --> 02:15.760]  like, Oh my God, I'm like 60 years old. This technology's running circles around me. I just
[02:15.760 --> 02:26.280]  was so confused. I hate you so much. Whoa. You want to see where, uh, that clip's from? And,
[02:26.480 --> 02:30.260]  uh, all the other clips that you're going to be seeing with the new F*** Face regulation
[02:30.260 --> 02:35.260]  animation, subscribe to F*** Face, the podcast, check it out now, get a first membership and get
[02:35.260 --> 02:39.920]  it a day early. Uh, it's really all we could ask from you. Uh, also don't scrump, please.
[02:39.920 --> 02:41.040]  I'm scrumping.
