[00:00.000 --> 00:03.200]  Is it somebody's zip fly down?
[00:03.320 --> 00:03.840]  Is it? No.
[00:04.720 --> 00:06.220]  Oh, hold on.
[00:06.520 --> 00:09.700]  Stop! No, she's just scheming and I don't trust it.
[00:09.740 --> 00:10.600]  I don't trust the scheming either.
[00:11.300 --> 00:12.820]  You're a cheater, so...
[00:12.820 --> 00:15.180]  So what we're about to do is we...
[00:15.180 --> 00:17.500]  Everybody remembers, globally,
[00:18.020 --> 00:19.760]  that we, not too long ago,
[00:19.800 --> 00:20.940]  we created a regulation sandwich.
[00:21.040 --> 00:22.940]  We decided that there were a million
[00:22.940 --> 00:25.240]  different kinds of sandwiches out in the world
[00:25.240 --> 00:27.040]  and there was no
[00:27.040 --> 00:29.240]  North Star of sandwiches.
[00:29.240 --> 00:31.680]  There was no sandwich
[00:32.140 --> 00:33.920]  guidepost that we could all rally around.
[00:34.120 --> 00:35.250]  So we took it upon us...
[00:36.800 --> 00:37.660]  It was a somber
[00:37.660 --> 00:39.180]  responsibility, but one that we...
[00:39.180 --> 00:41.060]  I think we attacked with vigor.
[00:41.880 --> 00:42.560]  Well, take it seriously.
[00:42.980 --> 00:45.180]  Yeah, we did take it seriously and we invented
[00:45.180 --> 00:46.520]  the regulation sandwich.
[00:46.920 --> 00:48.780]  Made from these ingredients you see in front of you.
[00:48.980 --> 00:51.260]  However, to my knowledge, none of us
[00:51.260 --> 00:52.700]  have ever eaten a regulation sandwich.
[00:53.240 --> 00:54.480]  Never made one, never eaten one.
[00:55.120 --> 00:57.280]  Came out of the lab and didn't think
[00:57.280 --> 00:58.900]  to make it after we invented it.
[00:59.080 --> 01:01.180]  So today what we're going to do is we're going to
[01:01.180 --> 01:02.280]  make it from memory,
[01:03.120 --> 01:05.420]  the three of us. We're going to see who makes the best regulation
[01:05.420 --> 01:06.700]  sandwich, but we also
[01:07.160 --> 01:09.480]  want to add a degree of difficulty to it, as we do with all things.
[01:09.560 --> 01:11.620]  So we're going to make it blindfolded.
[01:11.720 --> 01:13.380]  Well, we said you should be able to make it in the dark, right?
[01:13.400 --> 01:15.360]  You should be able to make it in the dark. It's a sandwich so regulation...
[01:16.740 --> 01:17.900]  I'd hate to be bread cut.
[01:18.920 --> 01:19.600]  It's a sandwich
[01:19.600 --> 01:21.540]  so regulation you can make it in the dark.
[01:21.660 --> 01:22.660]  So we're going to put that
[01:23.500 --> 01:24.360]  theory to test.
[01:25.280 --> 01:26.180]  You're going to use that.
[01:26.540 --> 01:28.360]  You're going to use this. But this morning,
[01:28.460 --> 01:28.600]  Gavin,
[01:29.920 --> 01:32.440]  we were thinking, we were looking at this earlier and we had an idea.
[01:34.200 --> 01:34.560]  Shouldn't
[01:34.560 --> 01:35.520]  this have eyeballs on it?
[01:36.620 --> 01:38.380]  Because say you're in bed asleep
[01:38.380 --> 01:40.140]  at night and somebody breaks in to
[01:40.140 --> 01:41.700]  strangle you or kill you. What if?
[01:42.060 --> 01:44.300]  If your eyes look like they're open, they're going to
[01:44.300 --> 01:46.140]  pause for a second. It's going to allow you
[01:46.140 --> 01:48.340]  a brief second to realize and to defend yourself.
[01:48.480 --> 01:50.400]  And then I got to thinking, if they're coming
[01:50.400 --> 01:52.440]  into the house to kill you, they're probably coming into the house
[01:52.440 --> 01:53.580]  to kill you because they know who you are.
[01:54.700 --> 01:55.900]  How hard is it
[01:56.360 --> 01:58.520]  to put this puppy on with somebody
[01:58.520 --> 02:00.340]  else's eyeballs on it? That's going to freak him out.
[02:00.400 --> 02:02.520]  And then you
[02:02.520 --> 02:04.480]  drop down a little fabric mustache.
[02:05.480 --> 02:06.580]  So you look like a different
[02:06.580 --> 02:08.740]  person. So you're sleeping in disguise.
[02:09.080 --> 02:09.800]  I want something to
[02:10.340 --> 02:11.600]  inhale in my sleep.
[02:12.100 --> 02:13.900]  You're going, like, I hate you.
[02:14.320 --> 02:16.440]  So I'm coming over to finally
[02:17.580 --> 02:18.620]  strangle the life
[02:18.620 --> 02:20.460]  out of you so I don't have to fucking deal with
[02:20.460 --> 02:22.180]  you again. And then I look down and go,
[02:22.440 --> 02:24.380]  well that's not Gavin, his eyes are open, he's got a mustache.
[02:24.580 --> 02:26.580]  And you look at it, it might
[02:26.580 --> 02:28.520]  be Andrew, and you go, I've already
[02:28.520 --> 02:29.060]  done it today.
[02:29.260 --> 02:31.720]  I recognize the mustache from Andrew.
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.140]  So it's Andrew's eyes. Andrew's eyes,
[02:34.340 --> 02:34.840]  Andrew's mustache.
[02:35.900 --> 02:38.140]  Like the car windshield thing.
[02:39.060 --> 02:39.680]  With the eyes.
[02:40.180 --> 02:41.920]  It is a dual purpose device.
[02:42.920 --> 02:44.560]  It's a sleep mask that helps you sleep.
[02:44.700 --> 02:46.380]  And also defends you from
[02:46.380 --> 02:47.480]  potential stranglers.
[02:47.480 --> 02:47.780]  I love it.
[02:49.180 --> 02:49.580]  Tony?
[02:50.920 --> 02:52.460]  You look very coquette right now.
[02:52.580 --> 02:54.180]  You have, like, a cute bow.
[02:54.680 --> 02:56.900]  It's like a Lana Del Rey kind of situation.
[02:57.840 --> 02:57.940]  Yeah.
[03:00.700 --> 03:01.500]  Yeah, they're...
[03:02.100 --> 03:03.480]  Okay, so wait, wait, wait.
[03:03.720 --> 03:04.840]  So what is this? Where's yours?
[03:05.080 --> 03:07.180]  We couldn't find three, so I'm just gonna use this.
[03:07.200 --> 03:09.420]  Well, I have a beanie I can just roll the thing down on.
[03:09.580 --> 03:10.180]  That's great.
[03:11.000 --> 03:12.860]  I feel like you're...
[03:12.860 --> 03:13.700]  He'll be alright.
[03:14.600 --> 03:15.660]  He can't see that.
[03:15.900 --> 03:17.300]  Alright, Chuck, come on.
[03:18.100 --> 03:19.620]  If you insist.
[03:20.040 --> 03:21.660]  Also, I'd just like to point out
[03:21.660 --> 03:23.760]  how the fuck do you struggle
[03:23.760 --> 03:25.760]  every episode to do an intro, but that
[03:25.760 --> 03:26.700]  was phenomenal.
[03:29.140 --> 03:29.940]  Uh, because
[03:29.940 --> 03:31.780]  you guys shut the fuck up this time.
[03:33.520 --> 03:34.400]  It's never...
[03:34.400 --> 03:35.440]  I'm never the problem
[03:35.440 --> 03:36.260]  in my intro.
[03:37.220 --> 03:38.420]  Most of the time.
[03:38.640 --> 03:41.920]  So we're gonna put the blindfolds on
[03:41.920 --> 03:44.060]  and then, so here's what it's laid out right now
[03:44.060 --> 03:46.120]  but Gracie is going to move it.
[03:46.340 --> 03:47.580]  Yeah, Gracie's gonna be rearranging
[03:47.580 --> 03:49.580]  and then, let's center these up a little bit more.
[03:49.760 --> 03:51.620]  Yeah, we don't want anybody to have an unfair advantage.
[03:51.780 --> 03:52.560]  Yeah, don't touch me.
[03:53.440 --> 03:54.760]  Let's do this in 18 minutes.
[03:55.340 --> 03:56.520]  I'll give you a five minute warning.
[03:56.640 --> 03:59.040]  Okay, I have my... ow, don't touch me.
[03:59.280 --> 04:00.500]  I have my blindfold on.
[04:02.540 --> 04:03.540]  I'm trying to hold your hand.
[04:04.100 --> 04:06.200]  Hey, you look like Robin, Eric.
[04:07.100 --> 04:07.680]  Thanks, man.
[04:07.920 --> 04:10.300]  That's not the first time I've been told that.
[04:10.300 --> 04:11.560]  Do I look like Scarecrow?
[04:12.160 --> 04:13.340]  You do look like Scarecrow.
[04:13.660 --> 04:14.980]  Wait, I haven't touched anything yet. What do you mean?
[04:15.020 --> 04:16.680]  Can I look at where stuff is at the moment?
[04:17.060 --> 04:18.720]  No, that's the whole point.
[04:18.740 --> 04:20.300]  I didn't take in where it was.
[04:20.560 --> 04:21.600]  She moved it all around.
[04:21.940 --> 04:24.060]  Yeah, but at least I have my own knife and things.
[04:25.260 --> 04:25.940]  Oh, Jesus.
[04:27.760 --> 04:27.940]  Okay.
[04:30.060 --> 04:31.420]  Alright, so this isn't a race.
[04:31.480 --> 04:32.740]  We're just trying to make the best sandwich.
[04:33.560 --> 04:35.180]  Why don't you go ahead and count us down.
[04:36.360 --> 04:38.080]  In 5, 4,
[04:38.080 --> 04:39.960]  3, 2,
[04:40.500 --> 04:41.920]  1. Sandwich!
[04:42.080 --> 04:42.240]  Okay.
[04:44.720 --> 04:45.780]  Don't touch me!
[04:46.560 --> 04:47.280]  Oh, was that you guys?
[04:47.400 --> 04:47.780]  Shut up.
[04:48.500 --> 04:50.660]  I put my finger straight in pesto.
[04:50.780 --> 04:51.040]  Okay.
[04:53.380 --> 04:55.780]  I should be able to do this blindfolded.
[04:56.700 --> 04:57.980]  Geoff's all in it.
[04:58.300 --> 04:59.800]  Gavin, that was a little bit...
[05:01.700 --> 05:03.180]  Geoff's all in it.
[05:03.820 --> 05:05.280]  Gavin, that was...
[05:05.280 --> 05:07.540]  You know, very carefully felt.
[05:07.640 --> 05:08.820]  It's good. Cool.
[05:09.280 --> 05:09.720]  Good.
[05:11.440 --> 05:12.220]  What are you doing?
[05:13.720 --> 05:15.100]  All I can get is ham.
[05:17.200 --> 05:18.320]  Are you sure?
[05:18.560 --> 05:20.400]  If I'm the only one blindfolded, I'm gonna be pissed.
[05:20.480 --> 05:21.060]  We're all blindfolded.
[05:22.100 --> 05:23.460]  I'm looking up at you right now.
[05:24.580 --> 05:25.600]  You do look like Robin.
[05:25.720 --> 05:28.340]  Y'all feel good to hang out at your stations.
[05:29.280 --> 05:30.380]  You're in the middle!
[05:30.380 --> 05:31.080]  Are you full?
[05:32.520 --> 05:33.860]  Alright, so far,
[05:34.180 --> 05:36.080]  this is what Gavin has accrued.
[05:36.280 --> 05:37.180]  There it is.
[05:38.020 --> 05:39.600]  I need the damn bun!
[05:43.420 --> 05:44.120]  There it is.
[05:44.120 --> 05:45.240]  Where's the tomato? There we go.
[05:45.380 --> 05:47.300]  There's what Geoff has gotten so far.
[05:47.580 --> 05:49.200]  Oh my god!
[05:50.300 --> 05:50.960]  Oh, sick.
[05:52.200 --> 05:53.120]  Look at that.
[05:54.320 --> 05:56.440]  So we're going for best sandwich?
[05:57.300 --> 05:58.340]  Yeah, we're going for best sandwich.
[05:58.340 --> 05:59.420]  Of the prettiest?
[06:00.900 --> 06:02.980]  You judge it on the criteria that you judge it on.
[06:02.980 --> 06:04.600]  Oh yeah, so I think how it looks,
[06:04.660 --> 06:05.700]  how it tastes, and
[06:07.120 --> 06:08.540]  if they get all the ingredients
[06:08.540 --> 06:09.080]  correct, right?
[06:09.480 --> 06:10.620]  Everyone washed their hands, right?
[06:11.160 --> 06:12.700]  I don't think anyone washed their hands.
[06:12.860 --> 06:15.080]  What are you doing? Don't touch my stuff!
[06:15.100 --> 06:16.820]  I'm trying to cheat!
[06:18.360 --> 06:18.540]  Here.
[06:19.500 --> 06:21.040]  You can have pesto right in front of you.
[06:22.620 --> 06:23.020]  Cool.
[06:23.880 --> 06:25.960]  This is easy. Honestly?
[06:25.960 --> 06:27.020]  It's supposed to be.
[06:27.260 --> 06:29.180]  I think I just need lettuce and pesto.
[06:29.280 --> 06:30.340]  Yeah, I think I'm pretty much there.
[06:31.100 --> 06:32.700]  This one there, that's good.
[06:34.160 --> 06:35.040]  Wow, okay.
[06:35.360 --> 06:36.660]  Nice, very nice.
[06:37.860 --> 06:39.420]  Every time I grab that,
[06:39.580 --> 06:40.740]  someone else grabs my hat.
[06:42.020 --> 06:42.700]  I'm just saying hi.
[06:44.820 --> 06:45.900]  Where's the rest of this?
[06:45.940 --> 06:46.860]  This is filled to the brim.
[06:47.340 --> 06:49.560]  Does anyone here have extreme sandwich confidence?
[06:50.540 --> 06:51.640]  I'm feeling pretty good.
[06:52.480 --> 06:52.920]  Wow!
[06:53.680 --> 06:55.060]  Well, if this was a time test,
[06:55.280 --> 06:55.840]  Geoff would win.
[06:56.040 --> 06:58.260]  I want more of this, actually.
[06:59.920 --> 07:00.700]  Yeah, here we go.
[07:00.860 --> 07:01.620]  Wait, no, that's ham.
[07:03.240 --> 07:04.660]  Yeah, that's probably for the best, Geoff.
[07:04.720 --> 07:05.320]  There we go.
[07:06.320 --> 07:08.060]  Oh my god, did I go straight in the jar?
[07:08.900 --> 07:10.380]  I think I'm done.
[07:11.840 --> 07:12.500]  Okay, I'm done.
[07:12.960 --> 07:13.440]  Are you done?
[07:14.000 --> 07:14.600]  Let's take a look.
[07:17.120 --> 07:18.180]  What do you mean, well?
[07:18.260 --> 07:18.820]  It looks great.
[07:20.380 --> 07:21.060]  Quality work.
[07:21.060 --> 07:21.620]  Geoff, did you finish, too?
[07:21.840 --> 07:22.680]  Yeah, I've been here for a while.
[07:23.720 --> 07:24.660]  Gavin, call it when you're done.
[07:25.360 --> 07:27.100]  But don't take off your blindfolds.
[07:27.200 --> 07:27.960]  Should be a big reveal.
[07:29.120 --> 07:30.580]  I feel good about this.
[07:31.960 --> 07:33.180]  Honestly, easy sandwich.
[07:33.560 --> 07:34.540]  Pretty quick, too.
[07:35.540 --> 07:36.780]  Blindfolded, not bad.
[07:38.900 --> 07:39.300]  God.
[07:40.280 --> 07:40.880]  How you doing, Gavin?
[07:42.300 --> 07:42.980]  He's plated.
[07:43.240 --> 07:43.640]  I'm done.
[07:43.640 --> 07:46.000]  Okay, everyone keep your blindfolds on.
[07:46.020 --> 07:47.140]  Geoff, please put your plate down.
[07:47.440 --> 07:48.540]  Nice and easy, right there.
[07:48.680 --> 07:52.980]  Okay, we're all going to take off our blindfolds.
[07:53.060 --> 07:53.880]  On the count of three.
[07:53.980 --> 07:54.100]  Ready?
[07:55.020 --> 07:56.480]  One, two, three.
[07:57.660 --> 07:58.240]  Oh, yeah.
[07:58.680 --> 07:59.680]  You cut yours in half.
[07:59.760 --> 08:00.300]  That was really cool.
[08:03.180 --> 08:03.900]  This looks...
[08:03.900 --> 08:06.200]  I thought that was cheese.
[08:07.280 --> 08:08.820]  Oh, my pesto's over here.
[08:10.120 --> 08:10.780]  Look at that.
[08:10.780 --> 08:12.120]  Alright, now it's up to...
[08:12.120 --> 08:13.960]  Gavin can get much of anything.
[08:14.240 --> 08:14.820]  What do you mean?
[08:15.540 --> 08:16.880]  I'm watching you grab it.
[08:17.180 --> 08:20.200]  I'm not American where you have like
[08:20.600 --> 08:23.100]  19 pieces of ham in a ham sandwich.
[08:23.220 --> 08:24.180]  I think two.
[08:24.360 --> 08:25.100]  I want it even.
[08:26.140 --> 08:27.460]  Can we get y'all to open it up?
[08:28.500 --> 08:31.040]  You want to see this sucker opened up?
[08:31.180 --> 08:32.120]  Check this out.
[08:32.440 --> 08:33.760]  Got the pesto on the top, too.
[08:34.340 --> 08:35.440]  There's a lot of ham.
[08:36.280 --> 08:38.600]  Some cheese, because I thought that was cheese, but it's not.
[08:38.600 --> 08:39.000]  It's ham.
[08:39.180 --> 08:41.300]  There's only one tomato, because it's all I could find.
[08:42.240 --> 08:44.920]  And then there's more ham, and then there's lettuce,
[08:45.080 --> 08:45.960]  and then a lot of pesto.
[08:47.080 --> 08:48.020]  Geoff, how are you feeling?
[08:48.040 --> 08:49.780]  I cut it.
[08:50.360 --> 08:51.520]  Oh, wow, that looks great.
[08:52.680 --> 08:54.220]  I got some pesto on the top,
[08:54.280 --> 08:56.540]  and then ham, and then I went with the layer of
[08:56.540 --> 08:58.680]  tomato, and then cheese, and then ham,
[08:58.800 --> 09:01.060]  and then lettuce on the bottom, I thought.
[09:01.600 --> 09:02.740]  And then, how are you doing, Gavin?
[09:03.480 --> 09:04.260]  What did I do?
[09:04.440 --> 09:06.760]  I went for some pesto,
[09:06.760 --> 09:08.680]  a couple of tommies, a little bit of cheese,
[09:08.800 --> 09:10.380]  and a ham, and a tomato underneath, just to...
[09:10.380 --> 09:11.720]  Did you not put pesto on the bun?
[09:12.500 --> 09:13.380]  Is there no pesto on the bun?
[09:14.660 --> 09:15.960]  It's on the stuff, though.
[09:16.060 --> 09:17.500]  It's where it needs to be.
[09:17.740 --> 09:19.600]  I got nervous about not having enough pesto.
[09:19.760 --> 09:21.200]  I think maybe that's the best one.
[09:21.340 --> 09:23.480]  I think, visually, Geoff wins.
[09:24.500 --> 09:25.620]  But, there's still the taste.
[09:25.680 --> 09:27.200]  I think Eric's, visually...
[09:28.200 --> 09:28.560]  Why?
[09:29.940 --> 09:31.340]  Can we all taste our...
[09:31.820 --> 09:34.760]  I'm going to save this one for...
[09:34.760 --> 09:36.720]  I'm going to cut half of mine off for testing.
[09:36.840 --> 09:38.100]  You know what? It's a good idea.
[09:38.240 --> 09:40.920]  Great idea. Okay, let's get Geoff digging in.
[09:41.920 --> 09:42.800]  How is it, Geoff?
[09:42.960 --> 09:44.240]  This is your first regulation sandwich.
[09:48.240 --> 09:49.640]  Tastes different than I thought it would.
[09:50.280 --> 09:51.080]  Good or bad?
[09:51.220 --> 09:51.460]  Good.
[09:52.100 --> 09:54.780]  Just different. Definitely a regulation sandwich.
[09:55.580 --> 09:57.400]  Okay. Let's see your cross-section.
[09:58.960 --> 09:59.740]  That's beautiful.
[10:00.000 --> 10:00.340]  It's colorful.
[10:00.600 --> 10:01.800]  It is very colorful.
[10:02.360 --> 10:03.380]  We made a colorful sandwich.
[10:03.380 --> 10:04.920]  No, we didn't.
[10:05.620 --> 10:06.760]  It's tomato-focused.
[10:06.920 --> 10:08.100]  Oh, I do like it.
[10:14.180 --> 10:15.660]  I'm excited to try this.
[10:15.800 --> 10:17.740]  I'm really impressed that you're eating that much of it, Geoff.
[10:18.580 --> 10:20.380]  I don't think I could handle another piece of food.
[10:20.500 --> 10:20.980]  He's pretty hungry.
[10:24.060 --> 10:26.880]  I will say, I don't think there's a lot I would change about this.
[10:27.040 --> 10:27.520]  This is like...
[10:28.180 --> 10:29.480]  If this was on a menu,
[10:29.760 --> 10:30.780]  at like a sandwich place,
[10:30.780 --> 10:32.500]  it's a pretty decent sandwich.
[10:32.640 --> 10:36.160]  The only thing I would change is I'd probably toast the cheese a little bit.
[10:36.860 --> 10:37.660]  Oh, good call.
[10:40.780 --> 10:41.700]  What's going on here?
[10:42.120 --> 10:43.380]  I had one of these little things.
[10:49.810 --> 10:51.110]  Okay, that one's mine.
[10:51.970 --> 10:52.850]  That one's juicy.
[10:54.630 --> 10:55.690]  Pretty pesto-heavy.
[10:55.930 --> 10:56.250]  Thank you.
[10:57.810 --> 10:58.530]  What do you think?
[11:00.410 --> 11:01.330]  Very pesto-heavy.
[11:01.330 --> 11:02.410]  Yeah, very pesto-heavy.
[11:02.810 --> 11:03.490]  Not bad, though.
[11:05.070 --> 11:05.970]  So which one's this one?
[11:06.030 --> 11:06.490]  That one's mine.
[11:06.790 --> 11:08.130]  And you went on that one first?
[11:10.190 --> 11:12.270]  Nick fucked it all up, but it's so good.
[11:12.490 --> 11:14.370]  Look, that's a nice cross-section.
[11:21.610 --> 11:23.310]  You're right, it is different than expected.
[11:23.710 --> 11:25.250]  Yeah, it doesn't taste like I thought it would.
[11:26.030 --> 11:27.950]  That one was very, very, very pesto-heavy.
[11:28.050 --> 11:29.590]  So that was kind of the main flavor.
[11:29.590 --> 11:30.750]  I am a big pesto guy.
[11:30.890 --> 11:32.710]  It tastes well-rounded to me.
[11:33.450 --> 11:36.370]  Again, it's a remarkably balanced sandwich.
[11:36.990 --> 11:38.190]  Do you want a palate cleanser?
[11:39.350 --> 11:40.330]  I think I'll pass.
[11:40.570 --> 11:44.170]  The pesto does such a good job of getting the olive oil kind of...
[11:44.170 --> 11:44.910]  It's really good.
[11:45.130 --> 11:45.570]  Alright, Geoff.
[11:46.050 --> 11:48.110]  You had the prettiest one.
[11:49.450 --> 11:50.810]  Now let's see if the taste matters.
[11:58.330 --> 11:59.330]  Now, Geoff...
[11:59.330 --> 12:00.530]  I think that actually...
[12:00.530 --> 12:02.150]  I wish I could have found more cheese.
[12:02.310 --> 12:04.350]  A lot of the ham that I threw on there I thought was cheese.
[12:04.490 --> 12:06.330]  I feel like we all focused on different stuff.
[12:06.470 --> 12:08.610]  Like Geoff is the cheese guy, you're the pesto guy.
[12:08.610 --> 12:09.630]  Oh, I'm definitely the pesto guy.
[12:09.650 --> 12:10.590]  And I was the tomato guy.
[12:11.230 --> 12:13.970]  He is less pesto, which matches well with that cheese flavor.
[12:14.010 --> 12:14.810]  I think it's coming through.
[12:15.070 --> 12:17.890]  I don't know anything about eating, except I like it.
[12:19.290 --> 12:20.390]  And then this is the last one.
[12:20.510 --> 12:21.090]  This is Gavin's.
[12:21.670 --> 12:23.530]  If you've never made a sandwich in the dark,
[12:23.770 --> 12:25.170]  in general, you should give it a try.
[12:25.170 --> 12:25.930]  Alright, Gavin.
[12:26.310 --> 12:27.110]  The Gavin test.
[12:27.750 --> 12:32.360]  Mmm, tomato guy.
[12:41.560 --> 12:43.500]  It's good, but it's missing a lot of the pesto.
[12:44.700 --> 12:46.380]  It's like ham and tomato.
[12:47.200 --> 12:47.640]  Alright.
[12:49.340 --> 12:50.840]  My spreadage wasn't necessary.
[12:50.920 --> 12:52.600]  I think I ate all the pesto on my side.
[12:52.800 --> 12:55.080]  Honestly, that could be a cultural difference too.
[12:55.080 --> 12:56.780]  They're deliberating.
[12:57.100 --> 12:59.200]  In England, Gavin's might be a clear winner.
[12:59.400 --> 13:01.600]  But he's one of them blokes,
[13:01.740 --> 13:03.480]  and I would have thought that he would have gone pesto heavy.
[13:05.140 --> 13:05.620]  Alright.
[13:06.740 --> 13:08.580]  Wow, I wish we had one of those
[13:09.320 --> 13:10.920]  things where we all got chopped.
[13:11.060 --> 13:12.660]  And what are your categories for scoring?
[13:13.040 --> 13:14.060]  Presentation and taste?
[13:14.360 --> 13:16.520]  Presentation and taste, but we combined
[13:16.940 --> 13:17.960]  for an overall score.
[13:18.720 --> 13:19.860]  That doesn't have a number.
[13:20.160 --> 13:20.860]  No number.
[13:21.540 --> 13:22.860]  Should we say
[13:22.860 --> 13:23.560]  winner to loser?
[13:24.240 --> 13:27.020]  Oh, why don't we start in third place?
[13:27.340 --> 13:27.960]  This is gonna hurt.
[13:28.260 --> 13:29.540]  Yeah, I'm about to be really hurt.
[13:30.480 --> 13:32.520]  It's okay. With the tomatoes.
[13:33.520 --> 13:34.320]  I'm afraid.
[13:35.260 --> 13:36.620]  You get one hot tomato.
[13:38.760 --> 13:39.860]  Oh, sweet.
[13:40.760 --> 13:42.580]  Okay, so then
[13:42.580 --> 13:44.620]  don't even say second. Who won?
[13:44.940 --> 13:46.180]  Who's first place?
[13:46.200 --> 13:46.660]  Alright, ready?
[13:46.660 --> 13:47.240]  Yeah.
[13:49.100 --> 13:49.700]  Geoff!
[13:52.020 --> 13:52.620]  Redemption!
[13:54.580 --> 13:56.000]  Fuck you, croutons!
[14:01.300 --> 14:02.640]  I'm gonna eat a celebration
[14:02.640 --> 14:03.140]  crouton.
[14:04.700 --> 14:06.180]  What happened to Gavin?
[14:06.680 --> 14:07.920]  Well, I inhaled a seed earlier.
[14:09.340 --> 14:10.300]  It was good.
[14:10.360 --> 14:11.320]  All the sandwiches were good.
[14:11.360 --> 14:13.860]  All kidding aside,
[14:14.440 --> 14:15.940]  stay the fuck away from croutons.
[14:15.960 --> 14:17.400]  He just ate me.
[14:18.460 --> 14:18.920]  Oh, really?
[14:20.260 --> 14:21.320]  That taste just brought back
[14:21.320 --> 14:22.620]  some hard memories.
[14:23.640 --> 14:24.240]  Yeah, PTSD.
[14:26.920 --> 14:28.040]  He's still eating a bean
[14:28.040 --> 14:29.140]  in the best way possible.
[14:29.240 --> 14:30.420]  Fucking baby's first sandwich.
[14:31.220 --> 14:32.400]  He did try to avoid where I've been.
[14:32.920 --> 14:34.420]  Okay, do an outro now.
[14:35.460 --> 14:36.340]  I'm the boss, baby.
[14:43.860 --> 14:46.200]  Wait, didn't you want to inhale a balloon?
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.560]  Y'all shouldn't inhale this like a balloon.
[14:48.640 --> 14:49.060]  No!
[14:49.540 --> 14:49.980]  Ew.
[14:52.840 --> 14:53.680]  Thanks for watching.
[14:53.780 --> 14:55.760]  Make sure you listen to the F*** Face podcast.
[15:06.080 --> 15:06.960]  Jesus Christ!
[15:06.960 --> 15:07.240]  God!
[15:08.520 --> 15:09.900]  That's quite violent.
[15:10.500 --> 15:11.060]  God.
[15:12.480 --> 15:13.800]  Sandwich transition.
