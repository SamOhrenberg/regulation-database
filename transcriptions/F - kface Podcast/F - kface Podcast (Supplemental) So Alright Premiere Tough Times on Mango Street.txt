[00:00.640 --> 00:06.820]  So I was riding my bike and listening to music the other day. It's the time I usually spend
[00:07.600 --> 00:13.620]  trying to come up with ideas for either F*** Face or for ANMA, the other two podcasts.
[00:14.400 --> 00:21.940]  And I was just listening to music and kind of zoning out. And I have this giant playlist
[00:21.940 --> 00:27.520]  on Spotify where I just add new music constantly, and then it just runs on random and repeat.
[00:28.060 --> 00:33.780]  And so I never know what's coming up. And then I just listen to it. And if it's something new
[00:33.780 --> 00:36.840]  that I put in that I don't like, I just immediately dump it. And otherwise, I'll just
[00:36.840 --> 00:41.820]  listen to it until I start to get sick of it. And then I'll rotate out. So I added a bunch of
[00:41.820 --> 00:49.020]  new music recently. And I've been kind of into like, I don't know, like pre-Townes Van Zandt,
[00:49.080 --> 00:54.800]  kind of like vaguely Western folk music, I guess, has been kind of interesting to me.
[00:55.320 --> 01:00.260]  And so there's this dude, David McWilliams, that I'd heard a song by. And so I added a bunch of his
[01:00.260 --> 01:05.760]  stuff. And the music he makes, I placed it in my head, like mid 60s. And I think that that's
[01:05.760 --> 01:11.600]  ended up being where it existed. But I always just assumed he was like, in my head, he was
[01:11.600 --> 01:18.020]  like some dude from El Paso or Amarillo. Anyway, one of his songs came on. And it's this like,
[01:18.020 --> 01:25.860]  kind of dark, almost like a Mac the Knife feeling song about, I don't know, this scary,
[01:26.060 --> 01:32.340]  dirty town at night, kind of desolate and rough. I'd only heard the song like once before.
[01:32.880 --> 01:36.940]  And so I'm like half listening. And he just keeps referring about to this place, Mango Street,
[01:37.080 --> 01:42.520]  and how rough it is on Mango Street. And I couldn't get that out of my head after I keyed
[01:42.520 --> 01:48.640]  in on that. So when I got home, I thought like, how bad can it be to live on Mango Street? Mango
[01:48.640 --> 01:54.000]  Street sounds... Honestly, it sounds pretty, pretty fucking joyous. So I MLS a bunch of
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.020]  Mango Streets. I found one in Lake Jackson, Texas. There's a house for sale. I would not want to live
[02:00.020 --> 02:06.900]  on Mango Street in Lake Jackson, Texas. So I moved on. You can buy plots of land in Mango
[02:06.900 --> 02:12.460]  Street of Eustis, Florida, but but it looks it just looks like swamp. I saw a place in Lantana,
[02:12.600 --> 02:17.920]  Florida, that's for sale that was a lot of money for a little house and I would not want to live.
[02:18.260 --> 02:23.240]  Anyway, then it gets worse. I found Mango Street in Brea, California, Jesus Christ. And then there,
[02:23.880 --> 02:30.480]  there was one in a lot of Mango Streets in Florida. Anyway, turns out, oh man, the worst
[02:30.480 --> 02:35.420]  might be in port the Mango Street in Port Ritchie, Florida. That was pretty scary.
[02:36.140 --> 02:42.140]  Anyway, it turns out maybe maybe Mango Street is a rough and tumble place to live after all. So
[02:42.720 --> 02:45.500]  anyway, I was kind of laughing about that. And I thought, I'm gonna go back and listen to that
[02:45.500 --> 02:49.940]  song and pay attention to the lyrics and and learn a little bit more about Mango Street.
[02:50.340 --> 02:55.840]  By the way, I found out there's a book in all that searching. I found out there is a God,
[02:55.900 --> 03:02.140]  I have so many tabs open of Mango Streets. I found out there. Oops, I just closed a tab.
[03:02.700 --> 03:07.060]  Anyway, I found out there's through Google searching about Mango Streets, I found there's
[03:07.060 --> 03:12.980]  a book called The House on Mango Street, which was a 1984 novel by Mexican American author Sandra
[03:12.980 --> 03:19.720]  Cisneros, about a 12 year old girl growing up in the in, I guess the Hispanic quarter of Chicago.
[03:20.220 --> 03:26.840]  And it's considered a classic. And apparently it has been, I'd never heard of it. But apparently
[03:26.840 --> 03:34.580]  it has been on the banned list for a lot of places. A lot of places have tried to to ban the
[03:34.580 --> 03:42.540]  book because of some challenging themes around, I don't know, domestic and sexual abuse and gender
[03:42.540 --> 03:49.900]  and identity. And so now I want to read that book. If you've read that book, go ahead and send me an
[03:49.900 --> 03:56.880]  email at eric at jeffsboss.com. That's my email address for this podcast, eric at jeffsboss.com.
[03:57.240 --> 04:02.360]  I need to go ahead and make that real fast because I was just a joke, but I think I'll do it. Anyway,
[04:02.460 --> 04:05.680]  if you've read the book, The House on Mango Street, let me know. I think I'll buy it and
[04:05.680 --> 04:11.580]  give it a shot. And maybe I'll talk about it later. Read every book, just a tip in life,
[04:11.760 --> 04:17.940]  read every book they try to ban every time. I promise you, you won't regret it. Anyway,
[04:17.940 --> 04:21.460]  so I go back to look at the lyrics and I find the song is called...
[04:22.960 --> 04:29.120]  Things run awry very quickly. I find out when I look it up. The song is called Three O'Clock
[04:29.120 --> 04:35.740]  Flamingo Street. So every time I heard him say Mango Street, he was actually saying Flamingo
[04:35.740 --> 04:42.220]  Street. And I was too embarrassed to look up Flamingo Streets after that. I'd spent so much
[04:42.220 --> 04:47.320]  time. I probably spent, I don't know, maybe 40 minutes looking up houses for sale on Mango Streets
[04:47.320 --> 04:51.920]  around the country. And I just I couldn't devote any more time to that. I gotta say,
[04:52.120 --> 04:56.320]  I thought Mango Street sounded like a lovely place to live. It seems like it's a pretty
[04:56.320 --> 05:02.580]  challenging place to live based on my research. If there's a place that sounds better than Mango
[05:02.580 --> 05:08.760]  Street, it's probably Flamingo Street. And the idea that a Flamingo Street is like a rough part
[05:08.760 --> 05:14.380]  of town, I thought was pretty fucking funny. And then I was looking at the lyrics, and they're
[05:14.380 --> 05:20.620]  really quite poetic. Like, it's just the first verse. It's, uh, empty, sound, deserted town
[05:20.620 --> 05:26.220]  beneath the silvery feathered down of morning's waking breath. Forgotten tunes and silver spoons
[05:26.220 --> 05:31.540]  goes to deeply shadowed gloom and dies a silent death. That's some like cowboy poetry, right? Like
[05:31.540 --> 05:36.220]  I thought that was pretty cool. And I think, man, I really enjoyed this, this David McWilliams,
[05:36.260 --> 05:42.460]  dude. So I decided to look up David McWilliams. And imagine my surprise, and I guess maybe the
[05:42.460 --> 05:47.080]  name McWilliams should have clued me in. David McWilliams is not from El Paso, and he's not
[05:47.080 --> 05:53.360]  from Amarillo, and he's not a country and Western singer at all. It turns out David McWilliams,
[05:53.360 --> 05:59.760]  who was born in 1945, is a singer, songwriter, and guitarist from Ireland, Northern Ireland.
[06:00.320 --> 06:04.960]  I don't know how I got it into my head that I was listening to like,
[06:07.280 --> 06:12.780]  Western alternative folk from the 60s. But goddamn, did it sound like country music to me.
[06:12.940 --> 06:19.240]  And now I'm discombobulated, like you wouldn't believe. And so I read a bunch about him. And
[06:19.240 --> 06:24.900]  yeah, he's like an Irish folk singer. So not only was I not listening to a song about Mango Street,
[06:25.020 --> 06:30.160]  a cowboy song about Mango Street, I also wasn't listening to a cowboy song about Flamingo Street.
[06:30.160 --> 06:35.260]  I was listening to an Irish folk song about a place called Flamingo Street. I still think it's
[06:35.260 --> 06:41.660]  weird that in and maybe if you're from Ireland, and you can check in, send an email to eric at
[06:41.660 --> 06:47.120]  jeffsboss.com. And let me know, is Flamingo Street like a euphemism for the wrong side of the tracks
[06:47.120 --> 06:52.720]  like the tough part of town, you know, like the Hell's Kitchen, if you will, of a of a major
[06:52.720 --> 06:59.320]  metropolitan area in Ireland? Because it sounds fucking darling. And are there even I'm gonna
[06:59.320 --> 07:07.400]  google this are there flamingos flamingos in Ireland? I bet there aren't. Why wouldn't I think
[07:07.400 --> 07:15.560]  Oh, well, shit. Dublin Zoo is home to a large flock of about 100 Chilean flamingos. Huh? Well,
[07:15.560 --> 07:19.860]  I guess. I don't know if they're indigenous or not. But I don't know that I care that much.
[07:19.860 --> 07:27.320]  You ever run into a flamingo in the wild in Ireland? If you have, let me know. Just send that email.
[07:33.450 --> 07:38.090]  I'm a kid. So am I gonna surprise you with a poster board I need for the science fair tomorrow?
[07:38.350 --> 07:42.570]  Probably. But can you get up to 40% off back to school essentials on Uber Eats?
[07:42.850 --> 07:47.830]  Definitely. So order on Uber Eats and get up to 40% off. Exclusions may apply. Check

[08:23.310 --> 08:28.670]  Anyway, in this, I started to Google the song Three O'Clock, Flamingo Street to see if I could
[08:28.670 --> 08:32.270]  find because it still sounds like a and I've read the lyrics all the way through and I don't know
[08:32.270 --> 08:39.690]  why it does now. I think it's because the music had this sort of like haunting, cinematic. It
[08:39.690 --> 08:43.670]  feels like I don't know how to describe a lot of music in the 60s and 70s had this like it was
[08:43.670 --> 08:52.170]  designed like of film but not for film if that makes any sense. Just very atmospheric in a way
[08:52.170 --> 09:00.690]  that I associate with old movies. Maybe that's just me. Anyway, so I started to Google Flamingo
[09:00.690 --> 09:07.150]  the Three O'Clock, Flamingo Street to see if I could find anything out about the song and why
[09:07.150 --> 09:14.030]  he wrote this song that you know about this like I said this like dark place in a town where bad
[09:14.030 --> 09:18.530]  stuff happens. People drink themselves to death and it's there's a lot of like glitz and glamour
[09:18.530 --> 09:21.990]  and bright lights but if you look behind the curtain and kind of in the alleyways and the
[09:21.990 --> 09:26.390]  cracks and the crevices it's all very dark and you know malevolent. And I got thrown for another
[09:26.390 --> 09:33.450]  fucking loop because I found out that this other band The Bachelors covered the song and I'd never
[09:33.450 --> 09:39.270]  heard of them and their song is totally totally different. It's the same song it just sounds
[09:39.270 --> 09:43.250]  totally different. It's good. I like it too. I don't like it nearly as much as the David
[09:43.250 --> 09:48.730]  McWilliams version but I encourage you to listen to both. So I thought well that's fucking weird
[09:48.730 --> 09:55.110]  and I noticed that The Bachelors version was recorded in 1967 and the McWilliams version
[09:55.110 --> 09:59.590]  was recorded in 68. And so then I thought fuck did these guys write that song? So then I start
[09:59.590 --> 10:07.430]  listening to other Bachelors songs and everything else they've done is like croony early Beatles
[10:08.590 --> 10:14.170]  happy poppy love shit and I don't like any of it. I do like the three o'clock the version of
[10:14.170 --> 10:19.950]  Three O'Clock Flamingo Street they recorded which also is interesting because it's very
[10:19.950 --> 10:23.430]  different from the rest of their music right? Like the rest of their music is all sappy love songs
[10:23.830 --> 10:29.630]  and and heartbreaking shit and then this song is like a like I said it's kind of like the 60s
[10:29.630 --> 10:33.430]  version of Mac and the Knife about which is like a rough part of town on a rough night and just
[10:33.430 --> 10:38.830]  like sadness and despair and it's got a tonally incredibly different from everything else they've
[10:38.830 --> 10:43.950]  done. And it definitely feels like a David McWilliams song to me because I've heard his other
[10:43.950 --> 10:48.170]  music and it all kind of strikes the same chord which is apparently not a country chord at all
[10:48.170 --> 10:53.410]  it's a fucking Irish folk chord and I'm an idiot. And so I do a bunch of googling and I can't
[10:53.410 --> 10:58.410]  find the answer I really don't know it's credited to David McWilliams most places uh they shared
[10:58.410 --> 11:02.430]  tour managers I guess they grew up in the same I mean they're both Irish they were probably from
[11:02.430 --> 11:06.870]  the same fucking town you know they probably like they probably played tons of shows together but I
[11:06.870 --> 11:12.230]  can't figure out which one of them wrote the song so if you know I would love to know um it feels
[11:12.230 --> 11:17.010]  more like a David McWilliams song to me just because like I said thematically it seems to fit
[11:17.010 --> 11:23.570]  all of his other music, whereas The Bachelors' other music is vastly different and not nearly
[11:23.570 --> 11:29.470]  as good as that one song. So I was reading up a little bit about The Bachelors, and that is a
[11:29.470 --> 11:35.950]  whole other can of worms. I read one funny thing. They used to be called... They started as a
[11:35.950 --> 11:43.130]  harmonica band together called the Harmonic Chords in 1957. They were also known as the Harmony
[11:43.130 --> 11:48.750]  Chords. I think the Harmonic Chords is quite clever. And I would love to know what a
[11:48.750 --> 11:55.330]  classically styled instrumental harmonica act was. I bet it wasn't a hit with the teens,
[11:55.430 --> 11:59.230]  though. I'll tell you that. Anyway, so they changed their name to The Bachelors
[11:59.230 --> 12:04.430]  at the suggestion of someone named Dick Rowe, who did A&R at Decca Records, who I guess is
[12:04.430 --> 12:11.570]  who signed them. Because... This is the funniest fucking thing. He recommended the name because
[12:11.570 --> 12:20.190]  that's the kind of boy a girl likes. So... Bachelor as opposed to what? I guess married?
[12:20.630 --> 12:26.310]  I would assume all women would prefer a single dude to a married dude if they are single and
[12:26.310 --> 12:30.450]  looking. But anyway, they changed their name to The Bachelors because that's the kind of boy a
[12:30.450 --> 12:38.010]  girl likes. Girls love Bachelors. It's in Wikipedia, so, you know, that's law. Anyway,
[12:38.010 --> 12:41.090]  then I started to read up about that band because like I said, I had never heard them
[12:41.090 --> 12:45.930]  before. And they were quite big. They were number one on the charts in Ireland and in the UK.
[12:46.850 --> 12:53.630]  They charted to number 10 in the US, I think, maybe even number three on some charts. So they
[12:53.630 --> 12:57.510]  had a pretty big career. So I was trying to read up a little bit about them because I'll be honest
[12:57.510 --> 13:03.250]  with you, the rest of their music was so uninteresting to me that I didn't... They even
[13:03.250 --> 13:08.550]  had like a... I want to say they had like a TV show or something too that they hosted. Anyway,
[13:08.850 --> 13:14.870]  so at some point, I got led... There was like a controversy section on Wikipedia.
[13:15.490 --> 13:19.870]  And so I started going down some more rabbit holes. And apparently this band, The Bachelors,
[13:20.050 --> 13:24.790]  fucking hate each other. And they have like on their website, which by the way,
[13:25.030 --> 13:32.470]  I recommend you go to The Bachelors website. It is thebachelors.co.uk because it is a
[13:33.870 --> 13:41.790]  slice of history in terms of web design. It is something that ugly internet would have reviewed
[13:42.710 --> 13:46.670]  scathingly back in the day. And now I find it to be incredibly charming and fucking
[13:47.230 --> 13:50.950]  confusing to navigate. But at some point, I ended up... And I'll be honest with you,
[13:51.330 --> 13:55.910]  I got bored with this pretty quickly because I didn't find it to be that interesting.
[13:56.170 --> 14:02.150]  But there is a whole page about this guy, John Stokes, who was one of the... From what I can tell,
[14:02.150 --> 14:06.730]  the founding members of the band. It was two brothers, Con and Deck. And then they brought
[14:06.730 --> 14:12.970]  this dude in at the beginning. And it's just like this whole long explanation of why they hate him
[14:12.970 --> 14:18.470]  and why they kicked him out of the band and how he's not a very good singer and how he was,
[14:18.690 --> 14:27.750]  I guess, a mean guy. And it's itemized, bulleted. It goes forever. And I defy you to get through it.
[14:27.750 --> 14:34.410]  And then there's like fucking pages to... They sued each other. And they have court documents,
[14:34.550 --> 14:39.610]  you can see, that say the dude's not allowed to perform under the name The Bachelors,
[14:39.670 --> 14:45.330]  only they are. But then he was doing it anyway. And so they tried to get it stopped,
[14:45.390 --> 14:51.350]  and they did stop. And so it's this whole thing about how don't see his version of The Bachelors,
[14:51.410 --> 14:57.330]  only see their version of The Bachelors. I don't know, man. Bad blood in the Irish 60s
[14:57.330 --> 15:03.030]  pop scene, apparently. So if you want to dive in, if that sounds interesting to you, dive in
[15:03.030 --> 15:08.190]  and let me know the finer points of it, because I couldn't keep it straight. All right.
[15:14.090 --> 15:20.830]  So curiosity got the better of me after I recorded this. And I had to go and look up
[15:20.830 --> 15:27.930]  Flamingo Streets around the United States. I did an MLS search, vastly different results
[15:27.930 --> 15:34.070]  from Mango Street. I didn't realize there could be such disparity in America between living on
[15:34.070 --> 15:39.490]  Mango Street and living on Flamingo Street. It is definitely the haves and the have-nots.
[15:40.170 --> 15:46.350]  Most of the houses on Flamingo Street are nice or fancy. There are a ton of them, by the way.
[15:47.010 --> 15:52.010]  There's one in Atlantic Beach. There's Flamingo Street in Philadelphia.
[15:52.690 --> 15:59.450]  There's actually a Flamingo Drive in Austin, which I am choosing not to count.
[15:59.870 --> 16:07.270]  But there's no shortage. Michigan, Minnesota, you know, and there's some there's some modest
[16:07.270 --> 16:14.630]  Flamingo Streets, but they're like Lake Placid, Florida. It's OK. Like there's some there's some
[16:14.630 --> 16:21.210]  there's some so-so streets around the country. But then there's some bangers, just some absolute
[16:21.210 --> 16:30.030]  bangers like Flamingo Street in New Orleans. It's Mansion City. It is insane. I would love
[16:30.030 --> 16:36.130]  I got to figure out how to end up on Flamingo Street. I want to live in a Flamingo Street
[16:36.870 --> 16:44.070]  in New Orleans. I think it's probably too late in life for me to to turn that around.
[16:44.330 --> 16:49.710]  Maybe in another life. Have you ever lived on a Mango Street or a Flamingo Street
[16:49.710 --> 16:54.870]  at any point in your life? Have you lived on Mango or Flamingo Street in Ireland?
[16:55.250 --> 17:01.590]  Apparently in Ireland, Flamingo Street, it's Ireland's Flamingo Street is America's Mango
