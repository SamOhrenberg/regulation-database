[00:00.000 --> 00:01.800]  Are you ready for what we're about to do?
[00:02.020 --> 00:02.180]  Yeah.
[00:02.360 --> 00:02.640]  Okay.
[00:03.280 --> 00:04.380]  I'm not concerned at all.
[00:04.880 --> 00:06.260]  How long do I have to stay in there with it?
[00:06.780 --> 00:07.460]  I think you should do a minute.
[00:07.700 --> 00:08.400]  Okay, one minute.
[00:08.880 --> 00:10.560]  One minute of closed nose flaps.
[00:10.860 --> 00:10.980]  Yeah.
[00:11.380 --> 00:13.200]  One minute. Start the timer.
[00:14.120 --> 00:16.200]  And you, did you volunteer to eat some afterwards?
[00:16.240 --> 00:17.240]  Or did someone else put that on you?
[00:17.520 --> 00:18.860]  Geoff put it on me, I'm pretty sure.
[00:19.120 --> 00:20.900]  Don't, don't eat it if you don't want to.
[00:21.480 --> 00:23.080]  I mean, I feel like I should.
[00:23.200 --> 00:24.960]  It's only, it's only you saying you wanted to eat it.
[00:25.600 --> 00:26.920]  Oh, it's not cool in here.
[00:27.060 --> 00:27.320]  No!
[00:27.320 --> 00:30.260]  So, in stage two, this is where we keep the porta potty.
[00:30.680 --> 00:32.680]  I think we might have to do a little bit of lifting,
[00:32.820 --> 00:35.200]  because we have, like, it's in a back corner.
[00:36.100 --> 00:38.780]  And Tony said, aren't we taking this to RTX in a couple weeks?
[00:38.780 --> 00:40.120]  And I said, I've already been through this.
[00:40.580 --> 00:42.500]  Oh, this is for you. Just, just in case.
[00:42.520 --> 00:44.480]  Yeah, there's a bucket for you to not puke in.
[00:44.640 --> 00:47.000]  So we, are we twisting this, or should we just go in as is?
[00:47.220 --> 00:49.100]  I would love to twist it, but it's a little...
[00:49.100 --> 00:49.500]  You got it?
[00:50.520 --> 00:52.420]  Help, can you help pull that, Nick?
[00:52.620 --> 00:52.760]  Yeah.
[00:53.480 --> 00:55.740]  Geoff, um, Gavin's gonna throw a GoPro in there.
[00:55.900 --> 00:56.060]  Yeah.
[00:56.880 --> 00:57.280]  This...
[00:57.280 --> 00:58.000]  I'll just put it on the door.
[00:58.320 --> 00:59.120]  ...is your sastrumming.
[00:59.300 --> 00:59.520]  Okay.
[01:00.760 --> 01:02.920]  And, uh, I've already closed my nose flaps,
[01:03.140 --> 01:05.060]  so I haven't been smelling anything since I got in here.
[01:05.060 --> 01:05.280]  Okay.
[01:06.000 --> 01:07.900]  There's the thumbnail. That's good. Cool.
[01:08.640 --> 01:10.160]  Holding sastrumming. Hang on.
[01:10.540 --> 01:12.620]  That's perfect. Look at his little head in there.
[01:12.980 --> 01:13.240]  Hang on, hang on.
[01:13.240 --> 01:14.160]  Geoff, are you ready?
[01:14.480 --> 01:16.340]  Yeah, I just opened this up, right?
[01:16.640 --> 01:18.260]  I'm gonna take my nose, my nose is turned off.
[01:18.340 --> 01:19.080]  Nose is turned off.
[01:19.140 --> 01:20.780]  Flaps are, flaps are secure.
[01:20.920 --> 01:22.700]  Okay, we're getting all of our masks on.
[01:23.040 --> 01:25.080]  We're gonna close the door, and you're gonna start.
[01:25.080 --> 01:26.620]  So what is, oh God.
[01:26.720 --> 01:27.420]  He's gonna, ready?
[01:27.840 --> 01:28.040]  Okay.
[01:28.240 --> 01:32.000]  Here we go. Three, two, one, now.
[01:32.080 --> 01:32.420]  Close the door?
[01:32.500 --> 01:32.660]  Yep.
[01:42.820 --> 01:44.460]  When does the one minute start?
[01:44.820 --> 01:45.300]  Uh, it's started now.
[01:45.300 --> 01:46.700]  It's already, it's started.
[01:47.140 --> 01:47.540]  Okay.
[01:47.980 --> 01:49.220]  How, how are you finding it?
[01:49.600 --> 01:50.760]  That's fine, I don't smell anything.
[01:50.980 --> 01:53.780]  Okay. And it's opened all the way like you took the lid off?
[01:54.080 --> 01:55.340]  I'm still taking it off.
[01:55.400 --> 01:55.820]  Oh, okay.
[01:55.820 --> 01:57.820]  Okay, great. It stops once the lid is off.
[01:57.860 --> 02:00.040]  Yeah, I think, I think once the lid's off is when we start.
[02:00.040 --> 02:01.020]  It's spilled.
[02:02.600 --> 02:03.860]  Okay, the lid's off.
[02:03.920 --> 02:05.400]  Okay, and, okay, there we go.
[02:05.820 --> 02:06.980]  Okay, a minute from now.
[02:07.100 --> 02:07.280]  Yep.
[02:07.500 --> 02:09.060]  Anything that you're noticing about the look?
[02:09.360 --> 02:10.440]  Uh, it looks gross.
[02:10.720 --> 02:11.020]  Okay.
[02:11.720 --> 02:12.640]  It looks real gross.
[02:12.880 --> 02:15.480]  Anything, anything you notice about the smell?
[02:15.820 --> 02:18.140]  No, I don't have any smell because I closed my nose.
[02:19.280 --> 02:20.880]  I can't believe it.
[02:21.080 --> 02:21.380]  Um.
[02:21.460 --> 02:22.340]  He's just in there.
[02:22.680 --> 02:25.640]  And you're inside the porta, how, how is it inside the porta potty?
[02:25.820 --> 02:26.980]  It's hot, it's sticky.
[02:27.180 --> 02:27.480]  Uh huh.
[02:27.700 --> 02:29.780]  And I've got this juice all over my hands.
[02:29.780 --> 02:33.940]  But I can't smell it because my nose is closed.
[02:34.780 --> 02:36.300]  He might have been for real.
[02:36.480 --> 02:38.340]  He might have, but that, we still have 30 seconds left.
[02:38.740 --> 02:39.760]  That's true, do you smell anything?
[02:39.760 --> 02:41.300]  I still haven't smelled it yet.
[02:41.400 --> 02:42.760]  I don't want to smell anything.
[02:43.160 --> 02:44.640]  Maybe we got the non-stink kind.
[02:44.700 --> 02:45.780]  I don't think that's the thing.
[02:46.760 --> 02:48.100]  I mean, do you want to stick your head in there and smell?
[02:49.320 --> 02:50.300]  Oh, I'm getting a whiff.
[02:50.540 --> 02:51.120]  Oh, you're getting a whiff?
[02:52.040 --> 02:53.020]  See, Nick, Nick knows.
[02:53.100 --> 02:54.380]  Oh, it smells like the inside of a sewer.
[02:54.780 --> 02:55.340]  I don't smell anything.
[02:55.360 --> 02:56.400]  And also, Nick's gonna eat this.
[02:56.860 --> 02:58.480]  Geoff, you only have five seconds left.
[02:58.700 --> 02:59.000]  Okay.
[03:00.120 --> 03:00.480]  Wow.
[03:00.840 --> 03:01.980]  I'm so impressed.
[03:02.380 --> 03:03.280]  Three, two, one.
[03:03.600 --> 03:04.180]  You did it.
[03:04.220 --> 03:05.020]  Way to go, man.
[03:05.420 --> 03:05.680]  Thanks.
[03:05.920 --> 03:06.280]  Great work.
[03:06.300 --> 03:06.880]  I'm gonna grab my phone.
[03:06.980 --> 03:07.580]  Yeah, that's good.
[03:07.660 --> 03:08.680]  Do they have a napkin or something?
[03:08.740 --> 03:10.140]  I don't want to touch it with the juice.
[03:10.420 --> 03:10.980]  That's amazing.
[03:11.280 --> 03:11.780]  I told you.
[03:12.160 --> 03:13.980]  I'd turn my nose off if I don't want to smell it.
[03:15.340 --> 03:15.980]  Are you alright?
[03:17.520 --> 03:18.940]  I assume it smells bad in there.
[03:18.980 --> 03:20.720]  I have no idea because I turned my nose off.
[03:22.580 --> 03:24.000]  Oh, it smells horrific.
[03:24.260 --> 03:24.620]  Does it?
[03:24.700 --> 03:25.200]  I don't know.
[03:27.280 --> 03:29.980]  I have the power of John Isinger, but only when I want to.
[03:30.420 --> 03:33.660]  Oh, I never wanted to smell it again.
[03:34.140 --> 03:35.040]  Are you still closed?
[03:35.260 --> 03:37.520]  Yeah, but I'm not gonna open my flaps.
[03:37.780 --> 03:38.140]  Are you kidding?
[03:38.940 --> 03:40.560]  What are you talking about, Nick? You gotta go eat it.
[03:40.620 --> 03:41.180]  Oh, I don't know, man.
[03:41.200 --> 03:42.600]  You guys are making all the fucking...
[03:42.600 --> 03:43.700]  Geoff, get it out for Nick.
[03:44.020 --> 03:44.680]  ...history. Alright.
[03:45.280 --> 03:45.400]  Here.
[03:51.340 --> 03:52.560]  You wanna go in there and eat it?
[03:52.700 --> 03:53.020]  No.
[03:53.840 --> 03:55.580]  Our video guy left!
[03:56.300 --> 03:57.760]  Gavin, this trash can's over here!
[03:57.920 --> 03:58.640]  Did you smell it, Mike?
[03:58.920 --> 04:01.120]  Gavin, I told you!
[04:02.020 --> 04:03.020]  I fucking told you!
[04:03.260 --> 04:03.920]  It still does nothing.
[04:04.300 --> 04:05.760]  It took a while to hit, but it hit!
[04:10.120 --> 04:11.480]  You gotta record, Gavin!
[04:11.840 --> 04:14.720]  Dude, when I was in full sprint, I thought I was gonna go in my mouth.
[04:15.800 --> 04:18.000]  Oh, Christ alive, Geoff, you brought it out.
[04:19.220 --> 04:20.160]  Stop! Stop!
[04:21.680 --> 04:22.480]  Can you...
[04:22.480 --> 04:25.180]  If we're going anywhere with it, we need to go outside.
[04:25.700 --> 04:26.580]  Can we take it outside?
[04:26.780 --> 04:27.640]  Why don't you just put it right there?
[04:27.760 --> 04:28.620]  Let's take it outside.
[04:28.780 --> 04:31.460]  Grab it and let's take it outside while your nose flaps are closed.
[04:31.660 --> 04:33.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. While you're...
[04:35.200 --> 04:36.840]  Oh, come on. Let's...
[04:36.840 --> 04:39.720]  Oh, it's so extreme. I was not expecting it.
[04:40.100 --> 04:40.940]  It's... it's...
[04:41.480 --> 04:43.900]  It's maybe the worst thing I've ever smelled.
[04:45.360 --> 04:46.140]  It's spilling.
[04:46.580 --> 04:46.980]  No!
[04:48.000 --> 04:48.880]  Hold on, I'll get the bucket!
[04:49.000 --> 04:49.680]  Put it in the bucket!
[04:49.680 --> 04:49.960]  Fuck it!
[04:53.500 --> 04:55.240]  Oh, that means I have to be fucking close to it!
[04:56.580 --> 04:56.900]  Okay.
[04:57.120 --> 04:57.440]  Oh, God!
[04:57.440 --> 04:59.680]  You're gonna get close and you're gonna fucking eat it!
[05:00.140 --> 05:02.520]  Yeah, but I'm not gonna eat it covered in all that juice.
[05:03.500 --> 05:04.540]  You wanna take a look at this?
[05:05.360 --> 05:08.260]  Somebody should probably clean the porta-body out. A lot of that juice is in the porta-body.
[05:08.460 --> 05:09.120]  Oh, God.
[05:09.140 --> 05:09.980]  Does it smell bad still?
[05:11.660 --> 05:12.300]  Oh, Christ.
[05:12.300 --> 05:13.100]  Yeah, I just don't know.
[05:14.260 --> 05:15.460]  I'm very impressed, Geoff.
[05:15.720 --> 05:17.280]  Uh, I gotta go back and get my...
[05:17.280 --> 05:18.960]  Yeah, I just noticed it's still closing.
[05:19.320 --> 05:20.600]  Yeah, I don't wanna open my nose up.
[05:20.880 --> 05:24.000]  I think the porta-body's gonna be stinker, too, probably.
[05:29.120 --> 05:29.740]  It's in here.
[05:35.040 --> 05:39.280]  Oh, there's nothing worse than, like, testing the air to see if you're away from it and then get a new...
[05:39.280 --> 05:42.040]  You're gonna... you don't... Nick, you don't have to eat that!
[05:42.820 --> 05:43.620]  Maybe a nibble.
[05:45.140 --> 05:48.140]  Well, grab some and bring it over, I guess, because we're not going over there.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.300]  Oh, people are not being over-dramatic when they're doing this.
[05:51.380 --> 05:53.740]  No, it really is the worst smell I've ever smelled.
[05:54.020 --> 05:55.240]  I tend not to lie to you people.
[05:55.580 --> 05:56.940]  Oh, someone's called the police.
[05:57.040 --> 05:59.880]  Yeah, they should. It's a fucking crime.
[06:00.180 --> 06:01.360]  God, can you imagine this on a plane?
[06:01.360 --> 06:03.060]  I'm gonna need to wash my hands.
[06:03.140 --> 06:03.360]  Yeah.
[06:04.840 --> 06:05.580]  Oh, that's bad.
[06:07.360 --> 06:08.540]  That smells bad.
[06:08.740 --> 06:09.660]  There's flies buzzing around.
[06:09.900 --> 06:10.820]  Yeah, I don't like that.
[06:10.960 --> 06:11.140]  No.
[06:11.900 --> 06:12.840]  Why do they look like sunglasses?
[06:13.520 --> 06:14.320]  You're wearing them.
[06:14.540 --> 06:14.840]  Oh, yeah.
[06:15.300 --> 06:16.240]  Nick, you don't...
[06:16.240 --> 06:19.140]  Oh, it smells even more rancid.
[06:19.580 --> 06:21.560]  There's a fly that just wants to get involved.
[06:21.600 --> 06:21.780]  Get out of here.
[06:22.020 --> 06:22.840]  It's too much for the fly.
[06:22.960 --> 06:23.880]  Oh, you're a maniac.
[06:27.280 --> 06:28.480]  He's gonna say it tastes okay.
[06:31.580 --> 06:32.620]  It's really salty.
[06:33.980 --> 06:34.760]  Tastes like the ocean?
[06:35.240 --> 06:37.260]  Yeah, it tastes like the ocean.
[06:38.640 --> 06:40.240]  It tastes like someone farted in the ocean.
[06:41.240 --> 06:42.000]  Fuck.
[06:44.680 --> 06:45.880]  It's not that bad.
[06:52.680 --> 06:53.440]  Okay.
[06:55.860 --> 06:57.840]  Alright, I'm gonna eat the bread that wasn't touched now.
[07:01.980 --> 07:02.680]  Oh, God.
[07:03.300 --> 07:04.060]  Fuck.
[07:07.060 --> 07:09.760]  Gotta hand it to Geoff.
[07:10.620 --> 07:11.320]  And Nick.
[07:13.660 --> 07:15.460]  Also have to hand it to Nick, I guess.
[07:16.580 --> 07:19.280]  Sir Strohming, the worst thing I've ever smelled again.
[07:19.500 --> 07:22.500]  I said I'd never smell it again, and I did, and it's...
[07:23.240 --> 07:26.260]  I couldn't believe how deeply it penetrated me.
[07:26.300 --> 07:28.940]  It smells like a diaper inside of a sewer.
[07:29.240 --> 07:31.140]  I smell it with my stomach somehow.
[07:31.160 --> 07:32.140]  It's so, like, rancid.
[07:32.580 --> 07:35.100]  Geoff has nose flaps like I couldn't believe.
[07:35.300 --> 07:35.460]  Yeah.
[07:35.560 --> 07:36.900]  I couldn't... if I...
[07:36.900 --> 07:38.940]  Could you imagine being in that smell for a minute?
[07:39.700 --> 07:40.380]  I would die.
[07:40.460 --> 07:41.800]  I would just not be able to breathe and die.
[07:41.800 --> 07:43.260]  He had a minute of it.
[07:43.380 --> 07:44.840]  He just fucking ate it.
[07:46.000 --> 07:47.280]  I have face jam after this.
[07:47.420 --> 07:48.520]  I will never be at that level.
[07:48.820 --> 07:50.320]  Well, way to go, Geoff.
[07:51.120 --> 07:52.080]  Geoff's our champion.
[07:52.240 --> 07:52.660]  Ding, ding, ding.
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.760]  Hey, I'm glad I finally put my nose flaps to the test, and I'm glad that they passed the fly colors.
[08:00.580 --> 08:01.200]  It's real bad.
[08:02.820 --> 08:05.040]  Yeah, I don't know why you choose to smell that. I'll just turn that off.
[08:05.100 --> 08:05.560]  Yeah, no, I'm good.
[08:05.780 --> 08:07.540]  What the fuck is that smell?
[08:08.300 --> 08:10.540]  I'm in there working and you guys gas me out.
[08:10.540 --> 08:11.560]  Did someone take a shit?
[08:12.720 --> 08:15.000]  Because it smells like someone took a fucking shit.
[08:15.120 --> 08:16.100]  Do you want to smell that bin?
[08:16.400 --> 08:17.380]  No, I really don't, Gavin.
[08:19.220 --> 08:22.580]  I was like in there working and I was like, I think they shit.
[08:23.360 --> 08:24.560]  It's just their stomach.
[08:25.240 --> 08:26.060]  It's just like fish.
[08:26.480 --> 08:27.740]  Good fucking god, dude.
[08:27.880 --> 08:28.660]  It's a stinker, though.
[08:30.240 --> 08:32.120]  Well, that'll do it.
[08:32.320 --> 08:32.640]  Alright.
[08:32.960 --> 08:33.600]  Fucking terrible.
[08:34.120 --> 08:34.560]  Vindication!
[08:34.560 --> 08:34.840]  Vindication!
[08:39.100 --> 08:39.920]  Alright, cut.
