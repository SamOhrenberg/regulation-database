[00:00.000 --> 00:01.860]  Are you ready for what we're about to do?
[00:02.060 --> 00:02.220]  Yeah.
[00:02.400 --> 00:02.680]  Okay.
[00:03.280 --> 00:04.420]  I'm not concerned at all.
[00:04.900 --> 00:06.520]  How long do I have to stay in there with it?
[00:06.800 --> 00:07.500]  I think you should do a minute.
[00:07.740 --> 00:07.940]  Okay.
[00:08.060 --> 00:08.440]  One minute?
[00:08.440 --> 00:08.720]  Yeah.
[00:08.900 --> 00:10.600]  One minute of closed nose flaps.
[00:10.880 --> 00:11.020]  Yeah.
[00:11.400 --> 00:11.900]  One minute.
[00:12.440 --> 00:13.260]  Start the timer.
[00:14.140 --> 00:14.580]  And you...
[00:14.580 --> 00:16.240]  Did you volunteer to eat some afterwards?
[00:16.300 --> 00:17.280]  Or did someone else put that on you?
[00:17.540 --> 00:18.900]  Geoff put it on me, I'm pretty sure.
[00:19.340 --> 00:19.700]  Don't...
[00:19.700 --> 00:20.940]  Don't eat it if you don't want to.
[00:21.520 --> 00:22.200]  I mean...
[00:22.200 --> 00:22.760]  It's only...
[00:22.760 --> 00:23.120]  I feel like I should.
[00:23.220 --> 00:25.000]  It's only you saying you wanted to eat it.
[00:25.600 --> 00:26.960]  Oh, it's not cool in here.
[00:27.080 --> 00:27.360]  No!
[00:27.360 --> 00:30.300]  So, in stage two, this is where we keep the port-a-potty.
[00:30.680 --> 00:32.740]  I think we might have to do a little bit of lifting,
[00:32.860 --> 00:33.440]  because we have...
[00:33.440 --> 00:35.220]  Like, it's in a back corner.
[00:36.140 --> 00:37.000]  And Tony said,
[00:37.100 --> 00:38.800]  aren't we taking this to RTX in a couple weeks?
[00:38.820 --> 00:40.140]  And I said, I've already been through this.
[00:40.640 --> 00:41.420]  Oh, this is for you.
[00:41.800 --> 00:42.540]  Just in case.
[00:42.560 --> 00:44.520]  Yeah, there's a bucket for you to not puke in.
[00:44.680 --> 00:47.040]  So, are we twisting this, or should we just go in as is?
[00:47.260 --> 00:49.140]  I would love to twist it, but it's a little...
[00:49.140 --> 00:49.540]  You got it?
[00:50.640 --> 00:50.960]  Help...
[00:50.960 --> 00:52.460]  Can you help pull that, Nick?
[00:52.640 --> 00:52.800]  Yeah.
[00:53.940 --> 00:54.580]  Geoff, um...
[00:54.580 --> 00:55.780]  Gavin's going to throw a GoPro in there.
[00:55.900 --> 00:56.100]  Yeah.
[00:56.960 --> 00:57.320]  This...
[00:57.320 --> 00:58.020]  I'll just put it on the door.
[00:58.360 --> 00:59.140]  ...is your Sastroming.
[00:59.320 --> 00:59.560]  Okay.
[01:00.840 --> 01:02.980]  And, uh, I've already closed my nose flaps,
[01:03.180 --> 01:05.060]  so I haven't been smelling anything since I got in here.
[01:05.060 --> 01:05.320]  Okay.
[01:06.080 --> 01:06.840]  There's the thumbnail.
[01:07.140 --> 01:07.600]  That's good.
[01:07.760 --> 01:07.920]  Cool.
[01:08.760 --> 01:09.480]  Holding Sastroming.
[01:09.840 --> 01:10.100]  Hang on.
[01:10.100 --> 01:10.620]  Let's check the front.
[01:10.720 --> 01:11.380]  That's perfect.
[01:11.500 --> 01:12.660]  Look at his little head in there.
[01:12.740 --> 01:12.880]  Alright.
[01:13.140 --> 01:14.200]  Geoff, are you ready?
[01:14.520 --> 01:15.540]  Yeah, I just opened this up.
[01:16.020 --> 01:16.380]  Right?
[01:16.680 --> 01:17.280]  I'm going to take my nose...
[01:17.280 --> 01:18.300]  My nose is turned off.
[01:18.360 --> 01:19.120]  Nose is turned off.
[01:19.140 --> 01:19.820]  Flaps are...
[01:19.820 --> 01:20.800]  Flaps are secure.
[01:20.940 --> 01:22.720]  Okay, we're getting all of our masks on.
[01:23.100 --> 01:24.140]  We're going to close the door,
[01:24.280 --> 01:25.120]  and you're going to start.
[01:25.120 --> 01:26.140]  So what is...
[01:26.140 --> 01:26.640]  Oh, God.
[01:26.800 --> 01:26.940]  Oh.
[01:27.000 --> 01:27.260]  He's going to...
[01:27.260 --> 01:27.460]  Ready?
[01:28.040 --> 01:28.700]  Here we go.
[01:29.300 --> 01:29.660]  Three...
[01:30.600 --> 01:30.960]  Two...
[01:30.960 --> 01:31.620]  One...
[01:31.620 --> 01:32.020]  Now.
[01:32.120 --> 01:32.460]  Close the door?
[01:32.520 --> 01:32.700]  Yep.
[01:42.900 --> 01:44.500]  When does the one minute start?
[01:44.860 --> 01:45.340]  Uh, it's starting now.
[01:45.340 --> 01:46.040]  It's already...
[01:46.040 --> 01:46.700]  It started.
[01:47.180 --> 01:47.540]  Okay.
[01:48.060 --> 01:48.420]  How...
[01:48.420 --> 01:49.260]  How are you finding it?
[01:49.580 --> 01:50.100]  That's fine.
[01:50.140 --> 01:50.780]  I don't smell anything.
[01:51.020 --> 01:51.280]  Okay.
[01:51.580 --> 01:52.820]  And it's opened all the way,
[01:52.840 --> 01:53.820]  like you took the lid off?
[01:54.220 --> 01:55.340]  I'm still taking it off.
[01:55.460 --> 01:55.820]  Oh, okay.
[01:55.820 --> 01:56.340]  Okay, great.
[01:56.620 --> 01:57.820]  It starts once and the lid is off.
[01:57.880 --> 01:58.460]  Yeah, I think...
[01:58.460 --> 02:00.080]  I think once the lid's off is when we start.
[02:00.080 --> 02:01.040]  It's spilled.
[02:02.620 --> 02:03.900]  Okay, the lid's off.
[02:03.960 --> 02:04.720]  Okay, and...
[02:04.720 --> 02:05.440]  Okay, there we go.
[02:05.860 --> 02:07.020]  Okay, a minute from now.
[02:07.140 --> 02:07.320]  Yep.
[02:07.520 --> 02:09.100]  Anything that you're noticing about the look?
[02:09.380 --> 02:10.480]  Uh, it looks gross.
[02:10.740 --> 02:11.060]  Okay.
[02:11.760 --> 02:12.680]  It looks real gross.
[02:13.000 --> 02:14.080]  Anything you notice about...
[02:14.760 --> 02:15.500]  the smell?
[02:15.800 --> 02:18.180]  No, I don't have any smell because I closed my nose.
[02:19.340 --> 02:20.960]  I can't believe it.
[02:21.120 --> 02:21.500]  Um...
[02:21.500 --> 02:22.360]  He's just in there.
[02:22.720 --> 02:23.840]  And you're inside the porta...
[02:23.840 --> 02:24.240]  How...
[02:24.240 --> 02:25.660]  How is it inside the porta potty?
[02:25.860 --> 02:26.960]  It's hot and sticky.
[02:27.220 --> 02:27.500]  Uh-huh.
[02:27.720 --> 02:29.800]  And I've got this juice all over my hands.
[02:31.680 --> 02:33.940]  But I can't smell it because my nose is closed.
[02:34.820 --> 02:36.620]  He might have been for real in there.
[02:36.620 --> 02:38.320]  He might have... but we still have 30 seconds left.
[02:38.860 --> 02:39.840]  That's true. Do you smell anything?
[02:39.840 --> 02:41.340]  I still haven't smelled it yet.
[02:41.440 --> 02:42.760]  I don't want to smell anything.
[02:43.120 --> 02:44.680]  Maybe we got the non-stink kind.
[02:44.720 --> 02:45.820]  I don't think that's the thing.
[02:46.800 --> 02:48.120]  I mean, do you want to stick your head in there and smell?
[02:49.320 --> 02:50.340]  Oh, I'm getting a whiff.
[02:50.560 --> 02:51.160]  Oh, you're getting a whiff?
[02:52.060 --> 02:53.040]  See, Nick knows.
[02:53.140 --> 02:54.420]  Oh, it smells like the inside of a sewer.
[02:54.800 --> 02:55.500]  I don't smell anything.
[02:55.500 --> 02:56.420]  And also, Nick's gonna eat this.
[02:56.900 --> 02:58.520]  Geoff, you only have five seconds left.
[02:58.720 --> 02:59.040]  Okay.
[03:00.300 --> 03:00.620]  Wow.
[03:00.940 --> 03:02.040]  I'm so impressed.
[03:02.440 --> 03:04.200]  Three, two, one. You did it.
[03:04.260 --> 03:05.040]  Way to go, man.
[03:05.440 --> 03:05.720]  Thanks.
[03:05.940 --> 03:06.320]  Great work.
[03:06.340 --> 03:06.920]  I'm gonna grab my phone.
[03:07.040 --> 03:07.620]  Yeah, that's good.
[03:07.700 --> 03:08.700]  Do they have a napkin or something?
[03:08.780 --> 03:10.160]  I don't want to touch it with the juice.
[03:10.440 --> 03:10.980]  That's amazing.
[03:11.320 --> 03:13.800]  I told you, I'd turn my nose off if I don't want to smell.
[03:15.380 --> 03:15.980]  Are you alright?
[03:17.600 --> 03:18.980]  I assume it smells bad in there.
[03:19.000 --> 03:20.700]  I have no idea because I turned my nose off.
[03:22.660 --> 03:24.040]  Oh, it smells horrific.
[03:24.300 --> 03:25.260]  Does it? I don't know.
[03:27.300 --> 03:30.000]  I have the power of John Isinger, but only when I want to.
[03:30.320 --> 03:33.700]  Oh, I never wanted to smell it again.
[03:34.220 --> 03:35.080]  Are you still closed?
[03:35.300 --> 03:38.180]  Yeah, but I'm not gonna open my flaps. Are you kidding?
[03:38.980 --> 03:40.580]  What are you talking about, Nick? You gotta go eat it.
[03:40.680 --> 03:40.920]  Oh, I don't know, man.
[03:40.920 --> 03:42.740]  You guys are making all the fucking...
[03:42.740 --> 03:43.720]  Geoff, get it out for Nick.
[03:44.060 --> 03:44.720]  History. Alright.
[03:45.320 --> 03:45.440]  Here.
[03:51.380 --> 03:52.600]  You wanna go in there and eat it?
[03:52.740 --> 03:53.060]  No.
[03:53.800 --> 03:55.580]  Our video guy left!
[03:56.460 --> 03:57.780]  Gavin, this trash can's over here!
[03:57.940 --> 03:58.660]  Can you smell it, Mike?
[03:58.920 --> 04:01.120]  Gavin, I told you!
[04:01.140 --> 04:01.600]  There are two layers.
[04:01.980 --> 04:03.480]  I fucking told you!
[04:04.260 --> 04:05.800]  It took a while to hit, but it hit!
[04:10.100 --> 04:11.520]  You gotta record, Gavin!
[04:11.840 --> 04:14.760]  Dude, when I was in full sprint, I thought I was gonna go in my mouth.
[04:15.820 --> 04:18.020]  Oh, Christ alive, Geoff. You brought it out.
[04:19.220 --> 04:20.200]  Stop! Stop!
[04:21.660 --> 04:22.540]  Can you...
[04:22.540 --> 04:25.240]  If we're going anywhere with it, we need to go outside.
[04:25.740 --> 04:26.580]  Can we take it outside?
[04:26.800 --> 04:27.700]  I'll just put it right there.
[04:27.780 --> 04:28.720]  Let's take it outside.
[04:28.820 --> 04:31.480]  Grab it and let's take it outside while your nose flaps are closed.
[04:31.680 --> 04:33.260]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. While you are...
[04:35.180 --> 04:36.900]  Oh, come on. Let's...
[04:36.900 --> 04:39.760]  Oh, it's so extreme. I was not expecting it.
[04:40.100 --> 04:40.940]  It's... it's...
[04:41.460 --> 04:43.920]  It's maybe the worst thing I've ever smelled.
[04:44.620 --> 04:46.160]  Uh, it's spilling.
[04:46.580 --> 04:47.020]  No!
[04:47.020 --> 04:48.900]  Hold on, I'll get the bucket.
[04:49.160 --> 04:49.720]  Put it in the bucket!
[04:53.520 --> 04:55.280]  Oh, that means I have to be fucking close to it.
[04:56.760 --> 04:56.940]  Okay.
[04:57.160 --> 04:59.700]  Geoff, you're gonna get closer. You're gonna fucking eat it.
[05:00.180 --> 05:02.540]  Yeah, but I'm not gonna eat it covered in all that juice.
[05:03.520 --> 05:04.560]  You wanna take a look at this?
[05:05.400 --> 05:08.300]  Somebody should probably clean the porta-body out. A lot of that juice is in the porta-body.
[05:08.300 --> 05:09.120]  Oh, God.
[05:09.160 --> 05:10.000]  Does it smell bad still?
[05:11.660 --> 05:12.300]  Oh, Christ.
[05:12.320 --> 05:13.140]  Yeah, I just don't know.
[05:14.280 --> 05:15.480]  I'm very impressed, Geoff.
[05:15.480 --> 05:17.280]  Uh, I gotta go back and get my...
[05:17.280 --> 05:19.440]  Yeah, his nose is still closing. You can hear it.
[05:19.460 --> 05:21.120]  Yeah, I don't wanna open my nose up. It's...
[05:21.120 --> 05:23.960]  I think the porta-body's gonna be stinker, too, probably.
[05:29.140 --> 05:29.760]  It's in here.
[05:35.060 --> 05:39.300]  Oh, there's nothing worse than, like, testing the air to see if you're away from it and then getting a new...
[05:39.300 --> 05:42.080]  You're gonna... you don't... Nick, you don't have to eat that.
[05:42.840 --> 05:43.640]  Maybe a nibble.
[05:45.200 --> 05:48.180]  Well, grab some and bring it over, I guess, because we're not going over there.
[05:48.880 --> 05:51.340]  Oh, people are not being overdramatic when they're doing this.
[05:51.420 --> 05:53.780]  No, it really is the worst smell I've ever smelled.
[05:54.080 --> 05:55.280]  I tend not to lie to you people.
[05:55.620 --> 05:56.960]  Oh, someone's called the police.
[05:57.080 --> 05:59.920]  Yeah, they should. It's a fucking crime.
[06:00.200 --> 06:01.380]  God, can you imagine this on a plane?
[06:01.380 --> 06:03.100]  I'm gonna need to wash my hands.
[06:03.180 --> 06:03.400]  Yeah.
[06:04.960 --> 06:05.600]  Oh, that's bad.
[06:07.340 --> 06:08.540]  That smells bad.
[06:08.760 --> 06:09.660]  There's flies buzzing around.
[06:09.660 --> 06:10.860]  Yeah, I don't like that.
[06:11.020 --> 06:11.160]  No.
[06:11.960 --> 06:12.860]  Why do you have my sunglasses?
[06:13.540 --> 06:14.340]  You're wearing them.
[06:14.600 --> 06:14.880]  Oh, yeah.
[06:15.320 --> 06:16.280]  Nick, you don't...
[06:17.340 --> 06:19.180]  Oh, it smells even more rancid.
[06:19.620 --> 06:21.540]  There's a fly that just wants to get involved.
[06:21.660 --> 06:21.800]  Get out of here.
[06:22.060 --> 06:22.880]  It's too much for the fly.
[06:22.980 --> 06:23.920]  Oh, you're a maniac.
[06:27.360 --> 06:28.500]  He's gonna say it tastes okay.
[06:31.660 --> 06:32.660]  It's really salty.
[06:34.060 --> 06:34.800]  Tastes like the ocean?
[06:35.240 --> 06:37.300]  Yeah, it tastes like the ocean.
[06:38.720 --> 06:40.260]  It tastes like someone farted in the ocean.
[06:41.160 --> 06:41.920]  Fuck.
[06:45.060 --> 06:45.920]  It's not that bad.
[06:53.060 --> 06:53.480]  Okay.
[06:55.860 --> 06:57.600]  Alright, I'm gonna eat the bread that wasn't touched.
[06:58.600 --> 07:02.720]  Oh, God.
[07:03.320 --> 07:04.020]  Fuck.
[07:07.130 --> 07:09.790]  Gotta hand it to Geoff.
[07:10.670 --> 07:11.350]  And Nick.
[07:13.710 --> 07:15.490]  Also have to hand it to Nick, I guess.
[07:16.630 --> 07:19.310]  Sir Strowman, the worst thing I've ever smelled again.
[07:19.530 --> 07:22.490]  I said I'd never smell it again, and I did, and it's...
[07:23.290 --> 07:26.310]  I couldn't believe how deeply it penetrated me.
[07:26.350 --> 07:28.950]  It smells like a diaper inside of a sewer.
[07:29.270 --> 07:31.170]  I smell it with my stomach somehow.
[07:31.190 --> 07:32.190]  It's so, like, rancid.
[07:32.630 --> 07:35.150]  Geoff has nose flaps like I couldn't believe.
[07:35.370 --> 07:36.950]  I couldn't... if I...
[07:36.950 --> 07:38.990]  Could you imagine being in that smell for a minute?
[07:39.730 --> 07:41.830]  I would die. I would just not be able to breathe and die.
[07:41.830 --> 07:43.270]  He had a minute of it.
[07:43.410 --> 07:45.190]  He just fucking ate it.
[07:46.050 --> 07:47.330]  I have face jam after this.
[07:47.470 --> 07:48.570]  I will never be at that level.
[07:48.890 --> 07:50.370]  Well, way to go, Geoff.
[07:51.170 --> 07:52.130]  Geoff's our champion.
[07:52.350 --> 07:52.690]  Ding, ding, ding.
[07:53.050 --> 07:57.810]  Hey, I'm glad I finally put my nose flaps to the test, and I'm glad that they passed the fly colors.
[08:00.630 --> 08:01.250]  It's real bad.
[08:02.870 --> 08:05.070]  Yeah, I don't know why you'd choose to smell that. I'll just turn that off.
[08:05.130 --> 08:05.590]  Yeah, no, I'm good.
[08:05.890 --> 08:07.570]  What the fuck is that smell?
[08:08.350 --> 08:10.590]  I'm in there working, and you guys gassed me out.
[08:10.590 --> 08:11.630]  Did someone take a shit?
[08:12.770 --> 08:15.050]  Because it smells like someone took a fucking shit.
[08:15.170 --> 08:16.150]  Do you want to smell that bin?
[08:16.450 --> 08:17.410]  No, I really don't, Gavin.
[08:19.250 --> 08:22.610]  I was like in there working, and I was like, I think they shit.
[08:23.410 --> 08:24.570]  It's just their stomach.
[08:25.270 --> 08:26.130]  It's just like fish.
[08:26.490 --> 08:27.770]  Good fucking God, dude.
[08:27.910 --> 08:28.670]  It's a stinker, though.
[08:30.270 --> 08:32.150]  Well, that'll do it.
[08:32.370 --> 08:32.810]  All right.
[08:32.990 --> 08:33.650]  Fucking terrible.
[08:34.150 --> 08:34.590]  Vindication!
[08:38.810 --> 08:39.910]  All right, cut.
