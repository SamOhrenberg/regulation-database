[00:00.000 --> 00:05.320]  Gavin texted me late on Thursday night. He texted me something along the lines of,
[00:05.420 --> 00:09.540]  and I don't know if you have it, you can read it. I just was horrified by a turkey sandwich.
[00:09.920 --> 00:14.740]  I think what I texted you was, I just got one of the biggest frights of my life from a turkey
[00:14.740 --> 00:20.760]  sandwich. Yes. I want to know, you asked me to guess. I couldn't think of a way that a turkey
[00:20.760 --> 00:25.220]  sandwich could horrify anyone. I thought I was going to die. You thought you were going to die?
[00:25.220 --> 00:32.680]  Yeah. Yeah. I was, I was on a plane and I think my subconscious had just been slightly affected
[00:32.680 --> 00:40.160]  by the fact that on the weather app, it said, uh, small aircraft advisory. And I thought,
[00:40.560 --> 00:45.060]  well, that probably has something to do with, you know, if you're in a small aircraft,
[00:45.380 --> 00:50.520]  maybe visibility is shit or something to do with that. But in my head, I was thinking like,
[00:50.620 --> 00:54.360]  I think I was like dozing off or something. I was thinking like, oh, does that mean there's
[00:54.360 --> 01:01.080]  a shitload of small planes around? Like our plane is going to have to dodge a bunch of small planes.
[01:01.520 --> 01:06.740]  There was like 1% of my brain that thought that's what it meant. There's a swarm of small
[01:06.740 --> 01:12.240]  planes outside. Yeah. The rest of my brain was like, oh, it's probably foggy or something.
[01:13.180 --> 01:16.960]  I was, then I decided I'll just keep an eye out. I'll look out the window.
[01:18.640 --> 01:24.960]  And I was looking out the window and suddenly I got the fright of my life in my peripheral vision.
[01:25.380 --> 01:31.380]  I, I saw what I thought was a plane hurtling into the side of our plane.
[01:32.220 --> 01:39.400]  All it was, was the flight attendant sliding a turkey sandwich onto the plate, onto the tray of
[01:39.400 --> 01:44.360]  the guy behind me. But in my peripheral vision, because it was under his light,
[01:46.720 --> 01:52.060]  it just came like at the plane in the reflection. And I jumped back and I was like,
[01:56.980 --> 02:01.300]  but, um, yeah, it was just perfectly, because there was nothing on his tray.
[02:01.640 --> 02:06.660]  There was like nothing lit up until the flight attendant aggressively slid a turkey sandwich,
[02:06.660 --> 02:13.240]  which just caused a weird optical illusion. And my heart was beating like 100 beats a minute for
[02:13.240 --> 02:21.800]  like two straight minutes. It came out of nowhere, man. It came. Did you scream out loudly? Yeah.
[02:25.540 --> 02:30.440]  Did anybody notice? I don't know. I was too embarrassed to look around.
[02:32.060 --> 02:38.600]  Whoa. You want to see where that clip's from and, uh, all the other clips that you're going
[02:38.600 --> 02:44.020]  to be seeing with the new face regulation animation, subscribe to the podcast, check
[02:44.020 --> 02:48.000]  it out. Now get a first membership and get it a day early. Uh, it's really all we could ask
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.520]  from you. Uh, also don't scrum, please. No scrumping.
