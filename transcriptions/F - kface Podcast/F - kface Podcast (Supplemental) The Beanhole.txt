[00:01.910 --> 00:06.130]  What we're about to do is a decade or so in the making, probably 12 years in the making.
[00:06.310 --> 00:06.390]  Yeah.
[00:06.630 --> 00:12.970]  We are finally going to realize my largest unrealized dream, which is digging a bean hole.
[00:13.490 --> 00:16.470]  Making beans via the bean hole method and then eating those beans.
[00:18.330 --> 00:18.690]  So...
[00:18.690 --> 00:22.490]  We've talked about this in the podcast. I'm not gonna over explain it, what you do.
[00:22.590 --> 00:25.230]  It's an old-timey thing they used to do in the Northeast. Loggers used to do it.
[00:25.570 --> 00:27.130]  Yeah, you put a bunch of beans in a pot,
[00:27.670 --> 00:28.330]  season it up,
[00:29.350 --> 00:32.970]  bury it in the ground, dump a bunch of hot coals on it, bury it,
[00:33.430 --> 00:35.370]  and then dig it up two days later, and you have the best beans on earth.
[00:36.130 --> 00:37.930]  So we need to dig a hole to do that in.
[00:38.590 --> 00:40.990]  The conventional wisdom is that the hole needs to be
[00:41.650 --> 00:47.650]  the size of the cauldron or Dutch oven, and then a half. So probably...
[00:49.650 --> 00:52.130]  about like that. And it needs to be
[00:52.730 --> 00:56.630]  about six inches, although I would say probably more like eight or nine, over.
[00:57.030 --> 00:59.430]  So we're gonna dig a hole about that size.
[00:59.850 --> 01:04.570]  All right, well, that's a good sign. We didn't hear an immediate ding off a brick.
[01:05.570 --> 01:11.130]  Now, if this turns into us popping a water main, a gas line,
[01:11.910 --> 01:14.670]  or electrocuting ourselves, I'm just gonna kill myself.
[01:17.730 --> 01:19.690]  Your ground is so much nicer than mine.
[01:20.350 --> 01:24.250]  We're in the right yard. That's good to hear. Okay, so the framework of the hole
[01:25.250 --> 01:26.490]  is clearly visible.
[01:29.350 --> 01:29.750]  Yeah.
[01:31.610 --> 01:33.110]  Well, this is gonna be easier than I thought.
[01:33.870 --> 01:40.050]  Yeah, it's not as deep as I was thinking. The biggest mistake I made was wearing a hoodie when it's 100 degrees outside.
[01:40.630 --> 01:45.010]  Anyway, I was fighting forest fires, or I was covering the army fighting forest fires in Montana,
[01:46.710 --> 01:47.110]  and
[01:47.110 --> 01:51.050]  much like you, I showed up with a camera. I was taking some pictures of a dude digging,
[01:52.350 --> 01:53.010]  and I get a
[01:53.990 --> 01:55.150]  shot for about 20 minutes.
[01:56.250 --> 01:58.610]  It was one of the earliest lessons I learned in the army as a journalist.
[01:59.450 --> 01:59.970]  Then a
[02:03.110 --> 02:05.670]  sergeant major, or somebody of rank,
[02:05.810 --> 02:06.670]  came up behind me and said,
[02:07.090 --> 02:11.230]  did you get some good pictures? And I said, sure did, sergeant major. And he goes, well, I guess you're done, then. Here's a shovel.
[02:12.530 --> 02:16.330]  Being a journalist just meant I got like a 20-minute break at the beginning of the day to take photos,
[02:16.390 --> 02:17.850]  and then I just did everything everybody else did.
[02:19.310 --> 02:20.450]  That's what I think about every time I dig.
[02:20.450 --> 02:23.450]  So that means, uh...
[02:41.010 --> 02:45.890]  We're not that far off. Is this the first time you've worked?
[02:47.210 --> 02:47.930]  Not ever.
[02:49.930 --> 02:54.570]  I feel like if we were in the UK right now, you would have to be in some sort of an orange or yellow safety vest.
[02:55.170 --> 02:59.130]  Yeah, a bit of high-vis. Yeah, you guys are constantly worried about your visibility.
[03:00.090 --> 03:02.110]  Hear that? What the fuck is that?
[03:02.570 --> 03:03.290]  Big rock.
[03:05.030 --> 03:06.290]  Oh, you're in the danger zone.
[03:09.050 --> 03:12.330]  What is that? Oh, that's a big-ass root, huh?
[03:12.330 --> 03:16.310]  I feel like there's so much more dirt out of the hole than could fit in the hole.
[03:16.430 --> 03:18.230]  If we can get past that rock, we're gold.
[03:18.630 --> 03:19.610]  Yeah. That's pretty much it.
[03:20.410 --> 03:22.530]  We're gonna keep uncovering to find out. It's not a rock at all.
[03:22.590 --> 03:24.790]  It's like the hood to a 50-tooth ewig.
[03:27.550 --> 03:30.210]  I wouldn't be surprised if we dig it up and it's like an old space heater.
[03:31.490 --> 03:33.730]  You know what's awesome, too? What?
[03:34.190 --> 03:36.090]  I bet that under here... It's fine.
[03:36.170 --> 03:36.610]  There's no rock.
[03:39.290 --> 03:40.870]  Dude, this... You weren't kidding about it.
[03:45.530 --> 03:46.790]  Oh, that hurts so much.
[03:47.790 --> 03:49.330]  Alright, let's see if I can get under it right here.
[03:52.050 --> 03:53.130]  Did you see what happened?
[03:53.490 --> 03:55.250]  I mean, no. I heard what happened.
[03:55.270 --> 03:57.510]  It fucking... The shovel head bent.
[03:57.850 --> 03:59.090]  Like the metal compressed.
[03:59.430 --> 04:00.270]  Try again.
[04:05.230 --> 04:07.150]  It's making metal look like plastic.
[04:07.430 --> 04:08.610]  Why is this rock here?
[04:08.730 --> 04:09.550]  Do you have a jackhammer?
[04:10.130 --> 04:12.550]  Oh, I do. I got a couple. Do you think that would help?
[04:14.270 --> 04:14.890]  Oh, God.
[04:17.520 --> 04:18.440]  A bit of leverage.
[04:20.000 --> 04:21.240]  This is the rock we're...
[04:23.960 --> 04:24.380]  Fuck.
[04:25.580 --> 04:26.840]  That hurt so bad.
[04:27.040 --> 04:27.880]  I need goggles.
[04:29.860 --> 04:30.880]  Do you have any goggles?
[04:31.680 --> 04:31.920]  What?
[04:34.220 --> 04:35.040]  Just close your eyes.
[04:37.580 --> 04:40.280]  I didn't expect this to be dangerous, but it is.
[04:41.200 --> 04:42.560]  Yeah, see, if you close your eyes, it's fine.
[04:42.720 --> 04:45.160]  Yeah. I can't see what I'm filming and you can't...
[04:45.160 --> 04:47.660]  I can't see what you're hammering.
[04:48.260 --> 04:49.260]  Oh, it hurts so much.
[04:55.180 --> 04:56.100]  Ah, shits.
[04:57.760 --> 04:58.220]  Ow.
[05:00.920 --> 05:01.840]  We're so stupid.
[05:02.980 --> 05:04.740]  There are so many better ways to do this.
[05:06.960 --> 05:08.100]  It's on that side, too.
[05:08.900 --> 05:10.040]  Who put it over there?
[05:19.100 --> 05:19.520]  Missed.
[05:21.380 --> 05:22.260]  Oh, that was good.
[05:22.840 --> 05:24.740]  If we want to push it further into the earth,
[05:25.560 --> 05:26.420]  we're doing it.
[05:28.540 --> 05:29.980]  This is why...
[05:29.980 --> 05:31.160]  Don't worry, buddy.
[05:32.580 --> 05:34.640]  This is why in the movies, I'm committed.
[05:36.800 --> 05:38.220]  When they dig a...
[05:38.220 --> 05:40.440]  like a grave to bury somebody that they murder,
[05:42.040 --> 05:43.240]  I'm always like, that's such bullshit.
[05:44.180 --> 05:45.280]  They're never out of breath.
[05:46.340 --> 05:47.540]  I don't care how motivated you are.
[05:47.940 --> 05:49.680]  If you wanted to bury me tonight here,
[05:50.340 --> 05:51.700]  I don't think there'd be enough hours
[05:51.700 --> 05:52.300]  before tomorrow.
[05:52.360 --> 05:55.620]  No, I'd be lucky if I got you on the ground by Sunday.
[05:58.760 --> 05:59.700]  Right in my eye.
[06:00.980 --> 06:01.880]  I'm part rock now.
[06:02.760 --> 06:03.680]  Oh, it is. It's moving.
[06:05.300 --> 06:05.720]  Yeah.
[06:07.240 --> 06:08.200]  How the fuck
[06:09.100 --> 06:10.360]  did we pick the spot
[06:11.220 --> 06:12.060]  in the yard?
[06:12.060 --> 06:13.800]  Of course we dug right on top of that.
[06:14.460 --> 06:16.100]  It would have been faster
[06:16.100 --> 06:16.900]  to dig a second hole.
[06:17.740 --> 06:18.980]  It still might be.
[06:25.150 --> 06:26.690]  Bean holes are not for the faint of heart.
[06:27.810 --> 06:28.650]  It's coming apart.
[06:29.710 --> 06:30.250]  Oh yeah.
[06:30.690 --> 06:31.890]  Good work.
[06:32.870 --> 06:33.730]  Good work, Kevin.
[06:34.570 --> 06:36.730]  Do you think you'll be criticized on your tool choice?
[06:36.910 --> 06:37.390]  I hope so.
[06:41.730 --> 06:43.350]  I'm like 90% focused
[06:43.350 --> 06:44.510]  on making a good bean hole, but
[06:46.110 --> 06:46.970]  10% looking
[06:46.970 --> 06:47.790]  for treasure, I'd say.
[06:49.450 --> 06:50.830]  Well, we'll split it 50-50
[06:50.830 --> 06:51.750]  if we find anything.
[06:52.310 --> 06:53.410]  50-50? That's generous.
[06:54.050 --> 06:54.970]  Well, you're doing half the work.
[06:55.430 --> 06:57.770]  Yeah, but you're my best friend.
[06:57.890 --> 07:00.470]  I would love to find treasure now
[07:00.470 --> 07:02.430]  just so you want to quickly renegotiate the terms.
[07:02.490 --> 07:03.510]  Delete this fucking file.
[07:04.070 --> 07:06.390]  Alright, $51.49 just so I have a majority
[07:06.390 --> 07:07.290]  stake in the
[07:09.050 --> 07:09.850]  treasure company.
[07:11.830 --> 07:12.930]  G&G Treasures
[07:12.930 --> 07:13.650]  holding
[07:17.390 --> 07:18.710]  I didn't realize
[07:18.710 --> 07:20.270]  I built so close to bedrock.
[07:22.350 --> 07:23.030]  We'll go
[07:23.030 --> 07:23.890]  till the shovel breaks.
[07:24.170 --> 07:25.790]  It is, for sure.
[07:26.050 --> 07:27.530]  It's a little wiggle worm.
[07:50.960 --> 07:52.620]  That was really good work.
[07:53.380 --> 07:54.360]  That was in there.
[07:55.220 --> 07:56.100]  Casualty of war.
[07:56.980 --> 07:57.960]  You're under it.
[07:57.960 --> 07:59.020]  That's it.
[07:59.240 --> 08:00.420]  It just needed to break the hammer.
[08:03.800 --> 08:04.460]  That's it.
[08:05.780 --> 08:07.380]  Dude, look at that movement.
[08:09.020 --> 08:10.000]  If this fucking shovel
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  breaks and hits me in the dick...
[08:16.120 --> 08:17.440]  Suck my butthole.
[08:18.560 --> 08:19.160]  Look at that.
[08:19.940 --> 08:21.560]  It's the official f***face rock.
[08:22.160 --> 08:23.100]  Yeah, this is f***face rock.
[08:23.220 --> 08:24.040]  Let us know if you want it.
[08:25.900 --> 08:27.160]  Alright, one more giant rock
[08:27.160 --> 08:29.100]  and we're done. I noticed that Eric didn't come
[08:29.100 --> 08:31.040]  and help. I did tell him
[08:31.040 --> 08:32.920]  we were doing it. Even if we don't
[08:32.920 --> 08:35.000]  find treasure, we can always start D&G
[08:35.900 --> 08:36.660]  excavations. Yeah.
[08:37.600 --> 08:39.020]  Well, just because we didn't find Trevor
[08:39.020 --> 08:39.920]  on our treasure...
[08:39.920 --> 08:42.980]  treasure on our maiden voyage doesn't mean we won't next time.
[08:43.320 --> 08:43.460]  Yeah.
[08:52.400 --> 08:53.500]  I'll make this rock smaller.
[08:53.960 --> 08:54.300]  Yeah.
[09:03.680 --> 09:07.040]  Yeah. I feel like I'm about to film
[09:07.040 --> 09:08.360]  you have a heart attack and die.
[09:08.920 --> 09:11.180]  I think this one... You think we're leaving it?
[09:11.560 --> 09:12.880]  I think this one might be a little much.
[09:17.860 --> 09:18.540]  I'll just...
[09:20.320 --> 09:21.020]  Hang on, let me just
[09:21.020 --> 09:21.480]  get the thumbnail.
[09:28.640 --> 09:29.820]  Oh, but imagine the taste
[09:29.820 --> 09:30.300]  when we do it.
[09:35.010 --> 09:36.330]  Every time I swing it, my balls
[09:36.330 --> 09:37.070]  hit me.
[09:40.070 --> 09:42.310]  It's freaking me out. It's making my balls
[09:42.310 --> 09:44.410]  super active. How are your balls so
[09:44.410 --> 09:46.450]  loose in this position? I don't know. I guess it's the angle
[09:46.450 --> 09:46.830]  of my hand.
[09:48.130 --> 09:49.490]  Just extending the hole that way.
[09:51.950 --> 09:53.930]  See, that shovel just chops roots.
[09:54.710 --> 09:56.030]  There's a fucking rock here!
[09:59.110 --> 10:00.290]  How big is that one?
[10:00.970 --> 10:02.330]  Alright, it seems like we're gonna have
[10:02.330 --> 10:04.290]  to fit this between a triangle of rocks.
[10:04.490 --> 10:06.190]  Oh, that's it. That's fucking
[10:06.190 --> 10:08.250]  great. That's amazing. That's easy.
[10:08.450 --> 10:09.870]  Let's put 8 inches down?
[10:10.790 --> 10:11.830]  6 maybe? 6 to 8?
[10:12.130 --> 10:14.290]  That's at least 6 inches over the top, which is
[10:14.290 --> 10:15.490]  more than it needs to be.
[10:17.350 --> 10:17.770]  Alright.
[10:18.790 --> 10:19.790]  Day one complete.
[10:20.590 --> 10:22.450]  I'll see you in a few days to bury some beans.
[10:22.590 --> 10:22.790]  Alright.
[10:23.990 --> 10:26.250]  Good work. Yeah. And we've got
[10:26.250 --> 10:26.870]  some...
[10:28.990 --> 10:29.790]  firewood as well.
[10:30.430 --> 10:31.750]  We'll definitely burn that up.
[10:32.270 --> 10:32.950]  It's bean day.
[10:33.990 --> 10:35.450]  So we're gonna put a
[10:35.450 --> 10:36.690]  little fire in the hole.
[10:37.410 --> 10:38.770]  I made the hole a little bigger too.
[10:40.290 --> 10:41.230]  Get out of there, dickhead.
[11:00.110 --> 11:00.750]  So what
[11:00.750 --> 11:02.610]  we're doing is
[11:02.610 --> 11:04.610]  we're taking our cast iron. We have soaked
[11:04.610 --> 11:06.850]  our beans, our 2 pounds of Great Northern
[11:06.850 --> 11:07.750]  beans overnight.
[11:08.890 --> 11:09.330]  And
[11:10.750 --> 11:12.750]  there are other types of beans I've also
[11:12.750 --> 11:14.650]  never heard of that you can use. I've never heard
[11:14.650 --> 11:15.190]  of Great Northern.
[11:16.350 --> 11:18.750]  Look it up on the internet. Now I'm pouring in
[11:18.750 --> 11:20.650]  like 3 quarters of a cup of molasses.
[11:21.250 --> 11:22.590]  I already put the salt and pepper
[11:22.590 --> 11:23.830]  in. I cut up
[11:24.550 --> 11:26.390]  and threw in 3
[11:26.390 --> 11:28.530]  onions. Next is maple
[11:28.530 --> 11:29.090]  syrup.
[11:30.150 --> 11:30.750]  Motherfucker.
[11:33.450 --> 11:34.050]  Okay.
[11:34.810 --> 11:36.130]  2 tablespoons
[11:36.650 --> 11:37.850]  of dry mustard.
[11:44.530 --> 11:45.370]  Close enough.
[11:48.060 --> 11:49.020]  This part cooks.
[11:50.400 --> 11:51.200]  We're all gonna get
[11:51.200 --> 11:52.860]  dysentery. Alright.
[11:53.420 --> 11:55.200]  Now we bring that to a simmer.
[11:56.340 --> 11:57.120]  And then it's ready
[11:57.120 --> 11:57.720]  to go on the ground.
[12:00.300 --> 12:01.060]  Hey, Henry.
[12:02.340 --> 12:03.080]  When I tell people
[12:03.080 --> 12:05.040]  about this, people are always very confused that you
[12:05.040 --> 12:06.400]  actually just make the beans.
[12:07.100 --> 12:09.080]  So you cook them separately to the hole.
[12:09.260 --> 12:10.960]  You don't really. I mean, you just
[12:10.960 --> 12:12.320]  cook them until they simmer. Okay.
[12:12.560 --> 12:12.740]  Just
[12:14.940 --> 12:16.920]  get them simmering. Now we need to
[12:16.920 --> 12:18.900]  triple wrap this in foil.
[12:19.240 --> 12:20.740]  I see you're a smeg fan.
[12:22.600 --> 12:24.280]  I appreciate a bit of smeg.
[12:24.940 --> 12:25.820]  Dabble in smeg.
[12:27.440 --> 12:28.960]  So you're just sort of wrapping the seal
[12:28.960 --> 12:29.520]  area.
[12:31.080 --> 12:33.260]  Yeah, I wonder how many loggers and lumberjacks
[12:33.260 --> 12:34.820]  opened up the hole to a bunch of
[12:34.820 --> 12:36.760]  muddy beans. I bet you
[12:36.760 --> 12:38.460]  figure out how to do it right real fast
[12:38.460 --> 12:39.980]  when there are other people counting on you.
[12:40.740 --> 12:42.460]  Yeah, the last thing you want is
[12:43.160 --> 12:44.920]  700 loggers asking to
[12:44.920 --> 12:45.620]  speak to the manager.
[12:48.100 --> 12:49.100]  Didn't we do a
[12:49.100 --> 12:51.040]  a whole
[12:51.040 --> 12:53.000]  ghost hunting episode about a
[12:53.740 --> 12:55.080]  logger who would kill people
[12:55.080 --> 12:56.060]  when they didn't do a good job?
[12:56.540 --> 12:58.600]  That was the guy that scratched Jeremy.
[12:59.060 --> 12:59.700]  That's right.
[13:00.600 --> 13:02.960]  Fire has been going since... for about two hours.
[13:03.280 --> 13:05.680]  Okay. And...
[13:05.680 --> 13:06.160]  Oh boy.
[13:07.060 --> 13:07.900]  Those are heavy beans.
[13:08.840 --> 13:09.880]  Dripping beans
[13:10.640 --> 13:12.100]  all over my new shoes.
[13:12.840 --> 13:14.020]  And my pants.
[13:14.680 --> 13:15.760]  I got bean pants.
[13:20.240 --> 13:21.400]  Pretty beaned up.
[13:26.440 --> 13:27.580]  Oh shit, dude.
[13:27.880 --> 13:28.960]  That's really hot.
[13:29.180 --> 13:29.980]  That's really hot.
[13:31.140 --> 13:31.840]  That's awesome.
[13:33.000 --> 13:33.860]  That's brutal.
[13:35.420 --> 13:37.220]  It's like we're standing on the sun.
[13:38.120 --> 13:39.800]  The whole world is on fire.
[13:40.220 --> 13:41.380]  I think it just got
[13:41.380 --> 13:43.460]  like 30 degrees hotter over here.
[13:43.480 --> 13:44.440]  Oh my god.
[13:46.600 --> 13:48.560]  Alright, we're lowering the beans in the hole.
[13:50.160 --> 13:51.620]  Should've brought my thermal camera.
[13:54.200 --> 13:55.180]  Here we go.
[13:59.480 --> 14:00.680]  Oh my lord.
[14:01.060 --> 14:02.740]  That sucks.
[14:10.360 --> 14:12.040]  We need bean goggles.
[14:12.040 --> 14:12.140]  Bean goggles.
[14:14.900 --> 14:15.640]  Smells good.
[14:16.220 --> 14:17.220]  It does smell pretty good.
[14:20.320 --> 14:21.700]  And then we get burying.
[14:22.780 --> 14:23.040]  Yeah.
[14:29.360 --> 14:30.180]  Trapping that heat.
[14:30.460 --> 14:32.060]  Wow, look how quickly the smoke disappears.
[14:32.720 --> 14:33.620]  Can't get out anymore.
[14:34.920 --> 14:36.240]  Look, look at the tiny little
[14:36.240 --> 14:37.120]  holes it's coming out.
[14:40.120 --> 14:40.520]  Gavin.
[14:41.560 --> 14:43.280]  This might be one of the cooler things we've done.
[14:43.280 --> 14:43.640]  Yeah.
[14:44.320 --> 14:46.600]  I guess this is the follow up to the bike trick video.
[14:46.840 --> 14:47.140]  Yeah.
[14:48.980 --> 14:51.220]  Geoff rides a bike and Geoff digs a hole.
[14:51.940 --> 14:52.500]  Alright beans.
[14:53.660 --> 14:54.660]  See you tomorrow.
[14:55.980 --> 14:56.760]  Don't worry.
[14:56.860 --> 14:59.520]  The hammer handle is in there.
[15:00.300 --> 15:01.660]  But it went in first.
[15:02.020 --> 15:02.340]  Alright.
[15:02.760 --> 15:05.520]  We will consume these beans tomorrow after hitting bulls.
[15:05.720 --> 15:06.640]  Yeah, in theory.
[15:14.320 --> 15:15.720]  You guys excited for beans?
[15:15.720 --> 15:18.340]  So there's just beans in the ground right here?
[15:18.520 --> 15:18.720]  Yeah.
[15:19.440 --> 15:20.100]  What were you expecting?
[15:20.720 --> 15:22.620]  You know, I'm not sure.
[15:23.480 --> 15:26.000]  I'm curious about the sealing of this pot.
[15:26.380 --> 15:27.820]  Well, we've gone for tinfoil.
[15:28.340 --> 15:29.860]  Several layers around the...
[15:29.860 --> 15:32.680]  The classic sealant of tinfoil.
[15:33.220 --> 15:34.920]  Well, I mean, what else are you going to use that won't melt?
[15:35.880 --> 15:37.980]  Uh, you know, when you're right, you're right.
[15:38.140 --> 15:38.760]  It's a fair question.
[15:39.020 --> 15:39.660]  Oh, it's warm.
[15:41.100 --> 15:42.100]  But is it warm?
[15:42.100 --> 15:44.060]  I was going to say, feel here.
[15:44.380 --> 15:45.460]  I'm pretty sure it's warm from the sun.
[15:45.500 --> 15:47.140]  It's warm from the sun.
[15:52.260 --> 15:53.400]  Is this the rock?
[15:53.640 --> 15:55.060]  That's the rock.
[15:55.340 --> 15:59.480]  And your idea was to dig through it?
[16:00.200 --> 16:01.160]  When do you feel the warmth?
[16:01.620 --> 16:02.340]  The fire, Gavin?
[16:02.640 --> 16:04.740]  No, I was just here for the burial on the fire.
[16:04.860 --> 16:05.440]  I filmed it though.
[16:05.900 --> 16:07.400]  Alright, hold on.
[16:07.400 --> 16:08.380]  Let's have a look.
[16:08.760 --> 16:09.040]  Is it warm?
[16:11.780 --> 16:12.380]  No.
[16:14.160 --> 16:15.240]  That's a bad sign.
[16:15.420 --> 16:17.180]  You can definitely smell it.
[16:19.060 --> 16:19.860]  Ice cold?
[16:20.920 --> 16:22.680]  It's sort of luke.
[16:23.240 --> 16:24.360]  It is...
[16:25.880 --> 16:29.520]  It's warmer than a slab buried in all that dirt should be.
[16:30.360 --> 16:31.260]  Is it hot?
[16:31.900 --> 16:33.280]  Oh, there's some heat under it.
[16:33.280 --> 16:33.960]  Woah.
[16:35.560 --> 16:36.780]  Is it warm?
[16:36.940 --> 16:37.080]  Nope.
[16:38.100 --> 16:40.860]  Are we about to eat cold beans from the ground?
[16:43.180 --> 16:44.460]  Oh, you don't need that heat glove?
[16:45.020 --> 16:45.540]  I guess not.
[16:46.560 --> 16:48.340]  I'm worried that we have cold beans.
[16:49.720 --> 16:54.140]  The way he's able to touch all of the fire parts with his bare hand.
[16:54.540 --> 16:55.300]  I'll be honest.
[16:56.240 --> 16:57.140]  Will we ever leave a chimney?
[16:57.900 --> 16:58.120]  No.
[16:58.560 --> 16:59.380]  Are we doing a bean reveal?
[16:59.380 --> 17:00.840]  Bean reveal. Bean unboxing.
[17:01.820 --> 17:03.020]  Beautiful bean face.
[17:04.220 --> 17:05.380]  You can smell them.
[17:06.700 --> 17:07.580]  Please be good.
[17:09.140 --> 17:09.660]  It's hot.
[17:10.260 --> 17:10.520]  Is it?
[17:10.960 --> 17:11.980]  Do you need your glove?
[17:13.040 --> 17:13.520]  Oooh.
[17:18.060 --> 17:19.460]  Let me get a spoon.
[17:20.080 --> 17:21.180]  Maybe we stir it.
[17:21.520 --> 17:23.500]  That's what needs... yeah, we gotta stir it.
[17:25.200 --> 17:26.800]  Don't you feel like a lumberjack?
[17:29.900 --> 17:32.760]  Just like a 1930s New York Yankee?
[17:35.140 --> 17:36.940]  So they can see each other in the woods.
[17:38.200 --> 17:38.480]  Huh.
[17:39.000 --> 17:40.400]  I wonder what went wrong.
[17:41.540 --> 17:43.180]  There was a lot more liquid before, right?
[17:43.340 --> 17:43.640]  Yeah.
[17:48.820 --> 17:50.480]  I can't recommend that.
[17:51.880 --> 17:52.480]  Really?
[17:53.100 --> 17:54.000]  Is it bad?
[17:55.940 --> 17:56.260]  Oh!
[17:57.100 --> 17:57.700]  The underside.
[17:58.800 --> 17:59.780]  There's some underside.
[17:59.780 --> 18:00.260]  The underside beans?
[18:01.000 --> 18:02.600]  Alright, somebody else take the first bite.
[18:02.820 --> 18:04.720]  Why would somebody else take the first bite?
[18:05.180 --> 18:05.720]  I'll do it.
[18:09.620 --> 18:10.800]  Down the hatch.
[18:17.390 --> 18:18.170]  I'll do them.
[18:21.130 --> 18:22.250]  They're not very warm.
[18:26.990 --> 18:28.490]  That one's for Geoff.
[18:29.230 --> 18:30.190]  I think...
[18:30.190 --> 18:32.430]  I think maybe... I don't know.
[18:32.530 --> 18:33.570]  Maybe just single scoop me that.
[18:33.570 --> 18:36.170]  Maybe next time we need to bury the metal bucket.
[18:36.530 --> 18:37.110]  Maybe it's spicy?
[18:38.590 --> 18:39.070]  No.
[18:41.930 --> 18:43.390]  There's pepper in it.
[18:43.850 --> 18:46.210]  I feel like maybe I'm gonna shit my pants a little bit.
[18:46.630 --> 18:47.930]  No, I think it's good.
[18:48.590 --> 18:49.830]  It tastes just like beans.
[18:50.330 --> 18:50.990]  Like baked beans.
[18:51.470 --> 18:52.170]  They don't taste bad.
[18:52.690 --> 18:54.670]  No, they're fine. I don't think it's worth the effort.
[18:54.670 --> 18:55.430]  God no.
[18:56.090 --> 18:58.970]  Geoff, you dug a hole and lit it on fire in your backyard.
[18:59.390 --> 19:00.310]  No, they're good.
[19:00.930 --> 19:03.130]  I think we may have just put the fire immediately out.
[19:03.510 --> 19:03.710]  Yeah.
[19:03.950 --> 19:05.250]  I think that's exactly what happened.
[19:05.570 --> 19:06.550]  I think there's room for improvement.
[19:07.090 --> 19:08.330]  I think this is a solid start.
[19:09.010 --> 19:10.410]  I think we need to shore up the bean hole.
[19:11.470 --> 19:12.950]  We need to get it better insulated.
[19:14.030 --> 19:16.870]  We need to get one of those thick metal covers to put over the top.
[19:17.850 --> 19:18.530]  We need to go deeper?
[19:19.550 --> 19:20.510]  Yeah, we probably need to go a little deeper.
[19:21.090 --> 19:21.550]  Can I have more?
[19:22.330 --> 19:22.910]  It's good.
[19:24.110 --> 19:25.650]  I'm going to have a little fat lump as well.
[19:26.050 --> 19:27.010]  You know what's going to be fun?
[19:27.170 --> 19:28.510]  If we all get food poisoning together.
[19:29.170 --> 19:30.850]  Beans and baseball. Does it get any better?
[19:31.350 --> 19:32.590]  Is there anything more American than that?
[19:32.770 --> 19:34.350]  Definitely. Geoff ate about
[19:35.590 --> 19:37.370]  200 baseballs and then went
[19:37.370 --> 19:39.450]  Boy, I sure need something to
[19:39.450 --> 19:40.630]  quench my thirst.
[19:41.390 --> 19:42.430]  Let's go dig up these beans.
[19:43.690 --> 19:45.370]  What's that? Salt? Fat?
[19:46.470 --> 19:47.990]  This is incredibly not refreshing.
[19:48.250 --> 19:48.410]  Yeah.
[19:50.810 --> 19:51.810]  We're going to make
[19:51.810 --> 19:52.750]  the regulation
[19:53.710 --> 19:54.150]  cookbook.
[19:54.470 --> 19:56.270]  And this will be the first recipe
[19:56.270 --> 19:57.790]  after we figure it out.
[19:58.590 --> 20:00.670]  Pages one to six are how to dig a hole.
[20:01.230 --> 20:01.450]  Yeah.
[20:02.310 --> 20:04.050]  What to do if you hit a rock.
[20:04.170 --> 20:05.810]  Keep going through the next six pages.
[20:05.970 --> 20:06.930]  Or keep going through the rock.
[20:07.790 --> 20:08.550]  Shovel hammer.
[20:09.330 --> 20:12.030]  Why don't we get an artist to make illustrations of
[20:12.030 --> 20:14.370]  find a pry bar, slam the rock.
[20:14.870 --> 20:16.510]  This looks like jerky.
[20:18.930 --> 20:19.950]  Yeah, that's fine.
[20:20.930 --> 20:22.590]  That's super malleable jerky
[20:22.590 --> 20:23.990]  that you can get that's really wet.
[20:24.690 --> 20:26.450]  You know like when you get jerky and it's just like
[20:26.450 --> 20:28.630]  wet and you're picking apart with your nails?
[20:28.850 --> 20:30.490]  Yeah. The thing is, I kind of want to eat
[20:30.490 --> 20:32.430]  more, but I feel like every minute I
[20:32.430 --> 20:34.110]  spend eating is two minutes on the toilet.
[20:34.610 --> 20:36.450]  Eat more. Eat more, dude.
[20:36.750 --> 20:38.230]  Take time for the toilet. Do me one more bowl.
[20:39.630 --> 20:42.490]  Here, you should finish that. No, I'll work on it.
[20:42.530 --> 20:44.450]  I'm working. Me and the dog
[20:44.450 --> 20:44.830]  are working.
[20:45.870 --> 20:46.870]  Okay, that's quite a lot.
[20:49.730 --> 20:51.030]  I can't wait to hear what
[20:51.030 --> 20:52.510]  Andrew thinks happened. Yes.
[20:52.830 --> 20:55.210]  We should start off with, like, Andrew, how do you think it went?
[20:55.470 --> 20:57.090]  Yeah. When we buried
[20:57.090 --> 20:58.990]  the beans, it was like, the hole was so hot
[20:58.990 --> 21:00.930]  it was uncomfortable to stand at.
[21:01.530 --> 21:02.870]  Gavin's got video of it right there.
[21:03.090 --> 21:04.870]  He can show you. It was brutal.
[21:06.030 --> 21:06.910]  It was hard to
[21:07.510 --> 21:08.750]  get into the hole.
[21:09.270 --> 21:10.710]  It was so hot. So what
[21:11.630 --> 21:12.430]  went wrong?
[21:14.430 --> 21:14.790]  And
[21:14.790 --> 21:15.310]  fade to black.
