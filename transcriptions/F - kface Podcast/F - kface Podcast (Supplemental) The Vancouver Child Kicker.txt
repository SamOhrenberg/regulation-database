[00:00.000 --> 00:02.620]  One time I almost kicked a child in the chest.
[00:03.000 --> 00:03.340]  Why?
[00:04.560 --> 00:05.280]  Um, okay.
[00:05.740 --> 00:08.420]  You ever have those thoughts like, man, what if somebody was following me?
[00:08.480 --> 00:09.060]  That'd be weird.
[00:09.180 --> 00:12.700]  And so I like, I checked my shoulder every once in a while, and I'm like, maybe three
[00:12.700 --> 00:13.480]  minutes from my house.
[00:13.480 --> 00:16.400]  And I had one of those thoughts like, man, wouldn't it be fucking crazy if somebody was
[00:16.400 --> 00:16.900]  following me?
[00:17.160 --> 00:22.280]  So I turned around and there was a black outline of a child and they were just standing still.
[00:22.340 --> 00:23.720]  They're like maybe a six year old boy.
[00:23.980 --> 00:28.800]  And I looked at him and I said, hey, and they just started slowly walking towards me.
[00:28.800 --> 00:30.540]  And I just kept saying, hey, what's up?
[00:30.680 --> 00:31.240]  How's it going?
[00:31.340 --> 00:31.780]  How's it going?
[00:31.840 --> 00:32.440]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:32.640 --> 00:36.920]  And I'm walking backwards, talking to this kid as he's walking forwards, and it was freaking
[00:36.920 --> 00:37.200]  me out.
[00:37.240 --> 00:38.080]  It was super creepy.
[00:38.220 --> 00:39.380]  I couldn't, there's like no face.
[00:39.440 --> 00:39.760]  There's nothing.
[00:39.840 --> 00:41.320]  It was just a black outline of a person.
[00:41.760 --> 00:46.400]  And we got to the point, if that kid would have taken like three more steps, I, in my
[00:46.400 --> 00:51.300]  head was like, I'm kicking you in the chest because if this is a zombie apocalypse, I'm
[00:51.300 --> 00:53.080]  not fucking zombie number six.
[00:53.280 --> 00:55.160]  We're making it through at least day one.
[00:55.560 --> 01:00.840]  So we're walking and then all of a sudden I hear a door open and this, this like a normal
[01:00.840 --> 01:05.460]  mom just yelled like, Peter, it's dinner, and then the kid just turned around and left.
[01:05.720 --> 01:10.220]  I like the idea that in your brain, all logic had gone and you were thinking, well, I'm going
[01:10.220 --> 01:13.660]  to regret not kicking the kid if I end up being zombie number six.
[01:13.860 --> 01:14.260]  Absolutely.
[01:15.080 --> 01:17.420]  That was like a pivotal moment in your life, I think.
[01:17.500 --> 01:21.820]  There's an alternate reality where you're in a completely different place and the split
[01:21.820 --> 01:24.880]  was your foot hit in the rib cage of that kid.
[01:25.340 --> 01:28.580]  You got arrested and you're like, oh, I thought he was a zombie.
[01:28.700 --> 01:29.880]  The judge sends you down.
[01:30.140 --> 01:31.220]  It was very, I don't know.
[01:31.280 --> 01:32.140]  Do you guys know what I mean?
[01:32.160 --> 01:32.980]  By like the light?
[01:33.120 --> 01:37.040]  There was no, he was a fucking black shadow, it was terrifying.
[01:37.400 --> 01:38.480]  He was silhouetted.
[01:39.300 --> 01:41.520]  Vancouver child kicker strikes again.
[01:44.520 --> 01:45.780]  City under siege.
[01:46.760 --> 01:49.080]  14th child kick in Vancouver Island.
[01:50.400 --> 01:51.060]  I'm not.
[01:51.560 --> 01:53.620]  I'm not a serial child kicker.
[01:53.780 --> 01:54.940]  When will this man be stopped?
[01:55.480 --> 01:57.040]  He kicked two people tonight.
[01:57.200 --> 02:01.080]  I'll be honest, Andrew, you don't know that you're not a serial child kicker.
[02:01.240 --> 02:03.220]  I'm pretty sure I'm not.
[02:03.320 --> 02:04.100]  Would I not know?
[02:04.180 --> 02:07.880]  Every one of us is a serial child kicker who just hasn't kicked their first child yet.
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.120]  That could have been your moment you found out.
[02:11.640 --> 02:12.640]  Once you pop.
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.380]  It became an addiction.
[02:19.360 --> 02:20.680]  I can't stop.
[02:22.560 --> 02:27.220]  I don't think it's great that you're mocking this traumatic point in my life, which I was
[02:27.220 --> 02:27.800]  kicked again.
[02:27.920 --> 02:28.700]  I was very scared.
[02:30.160 --> 02:31.640]  Oh, my God, that kid.
[02:32.120 --> 02:33.960]  He has no idea how lucky he is.
[02:34.100 --> 02:35.380]  No, he has no clue.
[02:35.560 --> 02:36.380]  That's a great point.
[02:36.480 --> 02:37.420]  That kid is just living.
[02:37.880 --> 02:40.880]  Imagine if some kid called Pete and listened to this podcast.
[02:43.000 --> 02:44.800]  He's like, oh, got away with that one.
[02:48.520 --> 02:48.920]  Whoa.
[02:49.160 --> 02:53.300]  You want to see where that clip's from and all the other clips that you're going to be
[02:53.300 --> 02:58.520]  seeing with the new fuck face regulation animation, subscribe to fuck face, the podcast, check
[02:58.520 --> 03:00.900]  it out now, get a first membership and get it a day early.
[03:01.340 --> 03:03.260]  It's really all we could ask from you.
[03:03.420 --> 03:06.020]  Also, don't scrum, please, no scrumping.
