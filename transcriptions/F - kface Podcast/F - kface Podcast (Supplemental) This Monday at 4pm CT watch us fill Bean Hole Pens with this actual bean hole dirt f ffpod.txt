[00:00.680 --> 00:02.140]  Let's get that fucking dirt!
[00:03.860 --> 00:04.900]  I'll do one more.
[00:07.260 --> 00:08.580]  You want some of this dirt?
[00:09.200 --> 00:10.160]  Oh, I'm sorry. Let me get out of your way.
[00:10.800 --> 00:11.720]  You want some of this dirt?
[00:12.300 --> 00:13.600]  You want some of this...
[00:14.140 --> 00:15.080]  bean hole dirt?
[00:15.600 --> 00:16.860]  I got buckets of this stuff.
[00:16.940 --> 00:17.440]  We do.
[00:17.620 --> 00:18.200]  It's like...
[00:19.240 --> 00:19.960]  dirty gold.
[00:20.480 --> 00:26.960]  And we're gonna be putting it in pins that you can buy this Monday, November 7th.
[00:26.960 --> 00:27.900]  That's not when the pins go on sale.
[00:28.040 --> 00:28.400]  Doesn't matter.
[00:28.620 --> 00:28.700]  Oh.
[00:28.700 --> 00:29.280]  We're just filling them.
[00:29.280 --> 00:33.400]  We're gonna be filling it on November 7th, Monday, during the Break Show.
[00:33.520 --> 00:34.080]  Nacho Helmet goes on sale.
[00:34.080 --> 00:35.480]  Nacho Helmet goes on sale.
[00:35.840 --> 00:37.780]  Maybe we'll put some nachos in a pin, too.
[00:37.920 --> 00:41.360]  But if you want your chance to get some of this hot-ass dirt...
[00:41.360 --> 00:41.920]  Dirt now.
[00:42.160 --> 00:45.320]  ...some of this grade-A, S-tier dirt,
[00:46.260 --> 00:47.320]  tune in on Monday.
[00:47.820 --> 00:48.660]  Watch us fill it.
[00:49.540 --> 00:51.120]  And eventually, someday, you'll be able to buy it.
[00:51.400 --> 00:51.680]  I don't know.
[00:51.820 --> 00:52.320]  No cum!
