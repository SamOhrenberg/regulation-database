[00:00.000 --> 00:01.480]  All right, should we get into this presidential stuff?
[00:01.580 --> 00:01.840]  Yes.
[00:02.340 --> 00:04.100]  Or, I shouldn't say presidential, but...
[00:04.100 --> 00:04.440]  Do you...
[00:04.900 --> 00:05.720]  Historical, great.
[00:05.940 --> 00:08.460]  Maybe we'll get a piece of Abraham Lincoln's beard or something.
[00:08.780 --> 00:09.460]  Oh, shit.
[00:09.700 --> 00:10.100]  Look at...
[00:10.100 --> 00:10.900]  Is it something?
[00:11.820 --> 00:12.640]  What is it?
[00:13.120 --> 00:14.760]  Emily, this day gets better.
[00:14.940 --> 00:15.460]  What is it?
[00:15.660 --> 00:17.540]  We have a Vincent van Gogh relic.
[00:20.800 --> 00:21.900]  What is it?
[00:22.040 --> 00:26.460]  So this is a piece of a letter that he wrote.
[00:26.460 --> 00:27.220]  Is that his handwriting?
[00:28.420 --> 00:31.060]  Yeah, we'll have to do some research, but that is...
[00:31.060 --> 00:34.420]  Whatever that piece of... that fragment of text is,
[00:34.600 --> 00:37.620]  it is personal to Vincent van Gogh.
[00:37.920 --> 00:39.520]  So we now have a Vincent... Don't touch it.
[00:39.540 --> 00:40.160]  I touched it.
[00:40.320 --> 00:42.680]  Jesus Christ, it's like 200 years old!
[00:42.800 --> 00:43.920]  Do you think I have a curse now?
[00:45.000 --> 00:45.700]  My ears.
[00:46.820 --> 00:48.480]  I don't even know what to say about that.
[00:48.600 --> 00:49.400]  That's so crazy.
[00:49.700 --> 00:52.060]  I didn't think we would beat Shaq last week.
[00:52.180 --> 00:54.620]  I certainly didn't think we could top a Shaquille O'Neal autograph,
[00:55.080 --> 00:56.600]  but Vincent van Gogh!
[00:56.600 --> 00:58.520]  Jesus Christ!
