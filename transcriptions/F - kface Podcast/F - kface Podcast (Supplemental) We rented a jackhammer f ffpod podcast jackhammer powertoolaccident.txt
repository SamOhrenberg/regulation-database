[00:00.000 --> 00:06.720]  I'd like to hear a story about, uh, you guys rented a fucking jackhammer and you dug a hole in Geoff's backyard? What happened?
[00:06.980 --> 00:08.620]  Well, there'll be a video for it.
[00:09.060 --> 00:09.920]  Oh, there's a video?
[00:10.360 --> 00:10.940]  Yeah, we filmed.
[00:11.120 --> 00:12.800]  Hell yeah! How did it go?
[00:13.100 --> 00:14.280]  We didn't need a jackhammer.
[00:15.320 --> 00:18.080]  Yeah, we didn't need it, but it was worth it.
[00:18.200 --> 00:22.220]  We should not be allowed to rent it. No one should be allowed to rent this kind of stuff.
[00:23.060 --> 00:27.680]  The amount of inadvertent triggerings of the jackhammer was unbelievable.
[00:28.540 --> 00:32.040]  It's like trying to reposition it or lift it up and it'd be like...
[00:32.880 --> 00:36.120]  If that thing shot bullets, half my neighborhood would have been dead.
[00:37.780 --> 00:39.580]  Every time you touched it, it went off.
[00:39.840 --> 00:41.280]  We broke some rocks apart.
[00:41.960 --> 00:52.060]  Mostly, it was Geoff getting it caught in a stump and then us having to try to pull it out of a stump for a really long time.
