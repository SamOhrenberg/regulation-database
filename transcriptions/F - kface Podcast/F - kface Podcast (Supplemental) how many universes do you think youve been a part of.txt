[00:00.000 --> 00:01.760]  Do you wanna hear my crazy theory on death?
[00:01.940 --> 00:03.000]  Yeah. Oh, I'd love to.
[00:03.100 --> 00:03.680]  I guess.
[00:03.960 --> 00:08.460]  I think everyone dies of old age in their own universe.
[00:10.820 --> 00:16.040]  Wait, so like JFK was not, that JFK was not part of our universe?
[00:16.440 --> 00:21.480]  Yeah, so when people die, they die in our universe and then they just switch to a different one
[00:21.480 --> 00:24.300]  where they didn't die and they just live on. Everyone keeps living.
[00:24.580 --> 00:25.740]  Everyone gets really lucky all the time.
[00:26.020 --> 00:27.120]  Do you think you know it?
[00:27.360 --> 00:29.340]  Do you think you're like, I don't know, that was weird.
[00:29.340 --> 00:30.480]  Did I just have a bad dream?
[00:30.720 --> 00:34.540]  Anyway, uh, or do you think like, well, I could have just choked on that hot dog.
[00:34.680 --> 00:37.140]  Ugh. And then in the other universe you did and died.
[00:37.360 --> 00:40.240]  And then you just warp into a universe where you didn't choke, essentially.
[00:40.540 --> 00:44.240]  I mean, I can, I can count a bunch of times where I should have been dead.
[00:44.520 --> 00:47.200]  And it's just so, it's like, how am I alive?
[00:47.380 --> 00:50.520]  And I just figured like, I must just have pivoted to the other universe.
