[00:00.000 --> 00:02.020]  Andrew Slack the other night, he goes,
[00:02.120 --> 00:05.020]  I just want to let everybody know my the Umi Digi died.
[00:05.280 --> 00:08.100]  And so if anybody needs me, I'm going to be I might be hard to reach for all.
[00:08.260 --> 00:10.240]  I thought he was going to a funeral for a pet or something.
[00:10.340 --> 00:11.940]  I was like, yeah, it sounded like Umi Digi.
[00:12.300 --> 00:14.200]  I was like, and he's like, no, my phone, you idiot.
[00:14.280 --> 00:15.980]  And I was like, I don't know how I was supposed to remember.
[00:16.120 --> 00:16.860]  That's what it was called.
[00:17.000 --> 00:19.320]  But I thought I was so concerned for a second.
[00:19.540 --> 00:20.820]  Sounded like a dead Tamagotchi.
[00:21.140 --> 00:22.700]  But I got a new phone coming. I'm excited.
[00:22.820 --> 00:24.140]  I hope it watermarks it as well.
[00:24.420 --> 00:26.140]  What I have, what I've headed my way.
[00:26.200 --> 00:27.760]  You guys can see the new future of tech.
[00:28.040 --> 00:29.020]  Is it another Umi Digi?
[00:29.020 --> 00:30.460]  Like a waterproof version?
[00:30.780 --> 00:33.900]  I don't want to spoil anything, but we'll see.
[00:34.080 --> 00:36.000]  We'll see what's coming in the future.
