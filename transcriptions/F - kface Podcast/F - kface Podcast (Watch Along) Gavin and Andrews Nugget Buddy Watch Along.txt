[00:00.000 --> 00:00.460]  You ready to go?
[00:00.760 --> 00:01.920]  The printer is a piece of shit.
[00:02.580 --> 00:03.860]  Your printer's a piece of shit?
[00:04.000 --> 00:04.740]  It's a piece of shit!
[00:05.260 --> 00:06.620]  You know what else is a piece of shit?
[00:06.700 --> 00:11.360]  These nugget buddies that I can't get, which is why we're here watching this stream.
[00:11.960 --> 00:13.520]  You don't like the nugget buddies, Gavin.
[00:13.680 --> 00:14.640]  I've been obsessed with them.
[00:14.800 --> 00:17.380]  I just don't know what the goddamn any of it means or is.
[00:18.100 --> 00:18.880]  What's a nugget, boy?
[00:18.920 --> 00:19.360]  What is it?
[00:19.400 --> 00:20.860]  It's a nugget and it's a buddy.
[00:21.020 --> 00:21.700]  It's a friend.
[00:22.000 --> 00:22.380]  But what's a-
[00:22.380 --> 00:23.420]  I don't think it could be more clear.
[00:23.740 --> 00:26.860]  What's a kerschel flambe or whatever those things are?
[00:27.600 --> 00:28.780]  What the fuck is a k-
[00:28.780 --> 00:29.920]  I don't even know what you're talking-
[00:29.920 --> 00:31.220]  A kerschel flambe?
[00:31.380 --> 00:33.160]  Whatever the hell you said it was.
[00:33.300 --> 00:33.660]  What are the-
[00:33.660 --> 00:34.400]  What are the things?
[00:35.220 --> 00:36.180]  The nugget buddies?
[00:36.460 --> 00:36.680]  Yeah.
[00:37.740 --> 00:39.100]  Uh, oh, we got Uptown Moe.
[00:39.140 --> 00:40.020]  We got Kerwin Fro-
[00:40.020 --> 00:40.820]  That was it.
[00:40.820 --> 00:42.840]  Kershen flambe was Kerwin Frost!
[00:43.640 --> 00:44.340]  There we go.
[00:44.860 --> 00:45.600]  Oh my god.
[00:46.380 --> 00:49.860]  So I guess for some context, we're watching The Break Show, which feels very meta.
[00:50.220 --> 00:53.260]  I'm recording through my Xbox like it's a Let's Play, which is dumb.
[00:53.660 --> 00:58.280]  And I mailed Geoff like 20 unopened nugget buddies from my collection.
[00:58.400 --> 00:59.480]  I'm missing two, Gavin.
[00:59.480 --> 01:01.980]  I need the Kerwin Frost and I need Darla.
[01:02.500 --> 01:04.020]  So that's what we're hoping to see get pulled.
[01:04.360 --> 01:04.820]  How do I-
[01:04.820 --> 01:06.720]  And you'll know them when you see them, I assume.
[01:06.980 --> 01:08.240]  I'll know them when I see them.
[01:08.320 --> 01:09.360]  Yeah, I'll call them out for you.
[01:09.460 --> 01:11.520]  We'll give updates so people at home can watch along,
[01:11.660 --> 01:13.620]  because this will be video as well as audio.
[01:14.400 --> 01:16.000]  I'm excited to see what happens here.
[01:16.160 --> 01:17.560]  We also don't know how long this will be,
[01:18.020 --> 01:20.500]  because Geoff typically does some bullshit at the start of the show
[01:20.500 --> 01:23.780]  and then he'll do unboxings like this might be very short
[01:23.780 --> 01:25.780]  or he might be an asshole and wait until the very end.
[01:26.960 --> 01:28.740]  Does he know we're doing this?
[01:29.480 --> 01:30.060]  He does!
[01:30.320 --> 01:30.460]  Okay.
[01:30.560 --> 01:30.680]  Yeah!
[01:31.360 --> 01:32.360]  Oh, here we go.
[01:35.160 --> 01:35.520]  Oh.
[01:35.880 --> 01:36.560]  How does he turn it up?
[01:38.620 --> 01:40.360]  Let me- let me turn up my balance.
[01:43.180 --> 01:44.840]  I- I made that really quiet.
[01:44.940 --> 01:46.300]  Oh, Eric's hyper. Look at him.
[01:46.800 --> 01:49.420]  Oh, he's like a little monkey. He's like bouncing around.
[01:51.400 --> 01:53.120]  I'm- I'm immediately concerned, Gavin,
[01:53.220 --> 01:56.280]  because I don't see a nugget buddy on that table at all.
[01:57.380 --> 01:58.720]  Well, maybe he's got them in a box somewhere.
[01:59.400 --> 02:00.380]  Geoff Ramsey, huh?
[02:00.640 --> 02:04.380]  That's true, but there's a lot of shit on that table and I don't see it.
[02:04.440 --> 02:07.880]  I see a bunch of Ramsey photos. I see Barbies.
[02:08.840 --> 02:12.640]  That show set makes sense when you know the show,
[02:12.700 --> 02:14.980]  but if you just tuned into this, man, what a mess.
[02:15.640 --> 02:19.160]  It looks like somebody fired a shotgun of random shit.
[02:19.780 --> 02:22.580]  And it's like everyone lives in a big pallet.
[02:25.360 --> 02:27.820]  It's like a storage locker, like you'd find
[02:27.820 --> 02:30.380]  and somebody bought with random assortments of collectibles.
[02:30.880 --> 02:33.280]  Yeah, it's like a real dud storage, you know, storage.
[02:33.460 --> 02:35.580]  Yes. Yeah, I do.
[02:36.760 --> 02:37.780]  I'm really worried.
[02:38.100 --> 02:41.560]  I haven't actually- I haven't noticed the face drawing in the back.
[02:41.660 --> 02:43.120]  I like- I'm a fan of that.
[02:44.940 --> 02:46.720]  Some of it I don't get, like the gremlins.
[02:47.100 --> 02:48.180]  Nothing against gremlins.
[02:48.400 --> 02:49.680]  I miss the gremlins a bit.
[02:57.820 --> 02:59.840]  Did you ever figure out what Geoff does in this?
[03:00.080 --> 03:02.120]  Remember, he told us he's done something no one's noticed.
[03:02.980 --> 03:04.120]  No, I know what he does for a living.
[03:05.020 --> 03:07.080]  Oh, shit. Oh, ad. We got an ad break.
[03:10.180 --> 03:12.720]  Skip! Wow, 48 second ad.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.600]  I'll tell you something that I mildly am annoyed about with this show.
[03:21.440 --> 03:21.900]  What's that?
[03:22.660 --> 03:25.820]  I'll let you know when we get- we need to go- see the wide right there?
[03:26.280 --> 03:28.240]  I'm the only one blocked out on that Zimmer.
[03:28.460 --> 03:29.520]  Boyz the Zimmer poster.
[03:30.040 --> 03:31.260]  The only one not seen.
[03:31.620 --> 03:32.120]  Where's the poster?
[03:32.220 --> 03:32.460]  They blocked me out.
[03:32.940 --> 03:36.460]  Yeah, look, to the left when they go wide, the mannequin fucking cut me out.
[03:36.540 --> 03:37.780]  I'm getting shoved out by the mannequin.
[03:41.740 --> 03:42.600]  They're talking about you.
[03:43.160 --> 03:44.360]  They are! Finally!
[03:44.800 --> 03:46.080]  Oh, they're the Nugget Buddies!
[03:46.960 --> 03:48.080]  He's gonna get straight to it.
[03:49.120 --> 03:50.140]  I hope he does.
[03:50.260 --> 03:51.000]  They were. They were in a box.
[03:51.100 --> 03:52.480]  Oh, yeah, you are. You're cut out by me.
[03:52.580 --> 03:53.280]  I thought I had more.
[03:55.840 --> 03:57.460]  Oh, look, let me- let me watch the feed.
[03:57.760 --> 03:59.520]  You fucking dick, Geoff!
[03:59.740 --> 04:01.800]  I don't want to watch the whole Break Show!
[04:02.120 --> 04:02.900]  You asshole!
[04:03.620 --> 04:04.240]  Oh, man.
[04:04.480 --> 04:06.960]  I love the Break Show, but get- I'm so sorry!
[04:11.860 --> 04:13.160]  Oh, what a dick!
[04:13.320 --> 04:14.060]  He knows what he's doing.
[04:14.880 --> 04:18.960]  He knows he's gonna make us watch us fucking go through some Lion King cards.
[04:19.360 --> 04:24.060]  Look, we have some of the best commentary content.
[04:24.480 --> 04:24.760]  Alright?
[04:24.760 --> 04:27.640]  No one comments on their own content as much as we do.
[04:28.680 --> 04:29.380]  It's true.
[04:30.120 --> 04:33.040]  Well, maybe we can have some fun facts about whatever they're- I don't even know.
[04:33.120 --> 04:34.420]  It's all American stuff, typically.
[04:36.080 --> 04:36.760]  Perot's VP.
[04:37.320 --> 04:38.640]  That's a detective, right?
[04:39.120 --> 04:40.460]  It's a card of billionaires?
[04:43.500 --> 04:44.680]  One-nine and a half?
[04:45.480 --> 04:46.200]  Ninety-two?
[04:47.280 --> 04:49.800]  Is a billionaire the type of card or is that person a billionaire?
[04:50.500 --> 04:52.880]  I don't know. Is Ross Perot a person?
[04:53.200 --> 04:54.600]  That's a person's name, right?
[04:54.760 --> 04:55.460]  I don't know.
[04:55.580 --> 04:56.860]  You know who Ross Perot is?
[04:57.340 --> 04:57.600]  No.
[04:58.620 --> 05:01.240]  I think that's Perot's VP selection.
[05:03.220 --> 05:04.020]  Oh, Hark-
[05:04.560 --> 05:06.060]  I don't- this is great.
[05:06.300 --> 05:09.320]  What a fucking qualified thing for you and I to talk about.
[05:09.340 --> 05:10.980]  U.S. political-
[05:10.980 --> 05:12.840]  Nothing like the 92 political race.
[05:14.280 --> 05:15.280]  I actually like that card.
[05:19.060 --> 05:20.100]  Would you wear that hat?
[05:20.780 --> 05:21.640]  I'd give it a go, yeah.
[05:21.640 --> 05:26.120]  Yeah, I think that would at least constitute as a goofy hat and a sloppy joe string.
[05:26.860 --> 05:28.520]  The electoral college.
[05:31.520 --> 05:32.360]  This-
[05:32.360 --> 05:36.040]  I'm hoping for a gerrymandering card to pop up.
[05:37.020 --> 05:39.080]  I'm looking for a half-Chad card.
[05:39.780 --> 05:45.180]  I think that was a thing, right? With the Al Gore election where it was like it wasn't fully hole punched or whatever.
[05:45.300 --> 05:46.300]  So they called it a half-Chad.
[05:46.440 --> 05:47.240]  Oh, the hanging Chad?
[05:48.140 --> 05:49.520]  Hanging Chad, yeah.
[05:50.720 --> 05:51.440]  Half-Chad.
[05:51.640 --> 05:52.840]  There we go.
[05:52.920 --> 05:54.940]  Didn't work out well for either of those.
[05:56.080 --> 05:56.400]  No.
[05:59.060 --> 06:01.120]  I don't know any of these people.
[06:01.540 --> 06:03.980]  That guy has NHL manager energy though.
[06:05.480 --> 06:07.560]  Oh, Richard Nixon.
[06:09.740 --> 06:10.840]  The original gate.
[06:13.080 --> 06:14.360]  Is he?
[06:15.380 --> 06:16.800]  Watergate was a big one.
[06:16.880 --> 06:17.920]  Wait, it just says-
[06:17.920 --> 06:20.040]  Why is Magic Johnson-
[06:20.040 --> 06:21.420]  It doesn't say his name.
[06:22.400 --> 06:22.660]  What?
[06:25.140 --> 06:28.040]  It just says AIDS in a picture of Magic Johnson.
[06:29.240 --> 06:31.740]  Well, he's got that billionaire AIDS, Gavin.
[06:32.020 --> 06:32.500]  What the-
[06:32.500 --> 06:33.360]  What's going on?
[06:33.980 --> 06:36.260]  I don't think he would have approved that card.
[06:36.820 --> 06:39.560]  Was it just a cultural pack or-
[06:40.260 --> 06:42.940]  There's also a great question of do you need approval for these things?
[06:43.000 --> 06:43.520]  Like, could you?
[06:43.860 --> 06:48.540]  I think if you took a major sports star and wrote AIDS on him and put it on a card, he would be-
[06:55.400 --> 07:00.200]  She looks like a librarian in like a soap opera TV show.
[07:00.880 --> 07:01.580]  That's true.
[07:01.880 --> 07:03.660]  Like some Gilmore Girls ass.
[07:03.980 --> 07:06.440]  She looks like everyone who told me to shut up as a kid.
[07:11.920 --> 07:17.800]  We have a cabinet?
[07:18.660 --> 07:20.240]  See, look, look, the wide shot, Gavin.
[07:20.520 --> 07:21.060]  I'm blocked.
[07:21.360 --> 07:22.320]  Yeah, you're blocked by me.
[07:24.660 --> 07:25.960]  But you're already there.
[07:26.240 --> 07:28.300]  Yeah, but I'm also on that other thing for some reason.
[07:29.160 --> 07:35.680]  It's like the RT podcast bit of Geoff, Geoff, Gavin, or Gavin, Geoff, Eric, and Gavin.
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.600]  We need to take the cardboard face off and put the balaclava on, I think.
[07:44.220 --> 07:50.280]  I keep looking at that video of Geoff getting his nose through that thing and it kills me.
[07:50.480 --> 07:53.700]  I think I might find that funnier than any other person on the planet.
[07:53.700 --> 07:56.540]  I can't stop hilariously laughing.
[07:56.760 --> 07:57.840]  I found it pretty funny at the time.
[07:58.580 --> 08:01.320]  You did, and I think you elevate the moment quite a bit.
[08:03.840 --> 08:04.720]  How was your weekend?
[08:06.320 --> 08:07.680]  We don't need to react to this.
[08:07.740 --> 08:08.860]  We could say fuck you to Geoff.
[08:08.960 --> 08:10.580]  We could just do our own thing while this is playing.
[08:10.860 --> 08:12.080]  Why was your weekend dog shit?
[08:12.120 --> 08:12.460]  What happened?
[08:13.120 --> 08:13.920]  It's just editing.
[08:14.060 --> 08:15.660]  I was editing for like the whole time.
[08:16.700 --> 08:19.260]  Oh, the stuff you filmed on Friday or slow-mo stuff?
[08:19.620 --> 08:20.960]  The stuff, slow-mo.
[08:21.320 --> 08:23.160]  I haven't even started the stuff we filmed the other day.
[08:23.900 --> 08:25.700]  I'm excited to hear about it.
[08:25.700 --> 08:27.440]  It's good that we filmed four videos on Friday.
[08:27.700 --> 08:28.900]  Four supplementals.
[08:30.160 --> 08:30.980]  That's exciting.
[08:34.200 --> 08:35.160]  I, uh...
[08:35.640 --> 08:39.060]  I'm excited for when we record on Thursday, I'm assuming?
[08:39.340 --> 08:41.280]  Because I've got some stories.
[08:42.020 --> 08:42.880]  Oh, some stuff's happened?
[08:43.520 --> 08:47.780]  Some stuff has happened in my life that is not fun, but I think you'll laugh at.
[08:48.120 --> 08:49.700]  Oh, definitely. I can't wait.
[08:50.300 --> 08:51.060]  What, um...
[08:51.060 --> 08:51.960]  I got a...
[08:51.960 --> 08:54.020]  I got a grade one hamstring injury.
[08:55.420 --> 08:58.000]  I'll let you try to figure out how between now and then.
[08:58.080 --> 09:00.500]  You can make a guess as to how I accomplished my grade one.
[09:00.760 --> 09:02.520]  Well, you've clearly slipped on something in the bedroom.
[09:05.920 --> 09:10.600]  I will say I tweeted about it, and I said if anyone gets it right, I'll give them a prize.
[09:10.720 --> 09:11.800]  And so far, nobody has...
[09:12.880 --> 09:15.740]  A few close guesses, but no one has gotten it exactly.
[09:20.580 --> 09:21.340]  What, um...
[09:21.340 --> 09:23.080]  Year of the animal were you born?
[09:25.020 --> 09:26.800]  That is a fucking...
[09:27.480 --> 09:31.000]  This is creepy that you asked me that question, because it's part of what I was going to talk about.
[09:31.080 --> 09:32.100]  I am a... I'm a Leo.
[09:32.860 --> 09:33.620]  What about you?
[09:35.400 --> 09:36.160]  You're a Leo?
[09:37.020 --> 09:39.320]  Yeah, I'm a... or you're... whatever that is.
[09:40.220 --> 09:41.400]  Dog? Am I a dog?
[09:41.720 --> 09:43.220]  Well, it's dependent on the year you were born.
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.360]  I'm 94... let me look it up.
[09:45.720 --> 09:46.500]  I'm the dragon.
[09:46.840 --> 09:48.060]  I think I'm an earth dragon.
[09:48.520 --> 09:49.240]  That... oh!
[09:49.700 --> 09:50.580]  You're a dragon?
[09:50.960 --> 09:52.920]  And it's dragon again this year, which means...
[09:52.920 --> 09:53.460]  It is.
[09:53.600 --> 09:54.480]  I think it's bad.
[09:55.420 --> 09:56.940]  No, for me it is.
[09:57.120 --> 09:57.280]  Oh.
[09:57.360 --> 09:59.320]  That... oh, you're... you and I are enemies.
[10:01.460 --> 10:04.920]  What year was the year of 1994?
[10:08.480 --> 10:08.980]  Let me look it up.
[10:10.160 --> 10:10.640]  Dog.
[10:11.160 --> 10:12.160]  So I'm a dog.
[10:12.380 --> 10:13.340]  You're a dragon.
[10:13.980 --> 10:16.240]  My rival symbol is the dragon.
[10:16.480 --> 10:17.760]  You and I have beef.
[10:18.360 --> 10:22.460]  We're just like... two wolves chasing each other around the moon or whatever.
[10:22.740 --> 10:23.520]  We are.
[10:23.820 --> 10:37.460]  But, like, months ago, I saw... I found when I was scrolling on TikTok this, like, ridiculous crypto bro who uses, like, astrology to make crypto predictions and, like, just general things.
[10:37.620 --> 10:40.780]  And he did a breakdown on what it means for a dragon year.
[10:41.100 --> 10:44.940]  And he was like, if you're... if you're a dog, you gotta fucking watch out.
[10:45.040 --> 10:45.900]  It's your enemy's year.
[10:46.380 --> 10:47.460]  You gotta watch these dragons.
[10:47.960 --> 10:49.400]  You're gonna have a bad year.
[10:49.560 --> 10:50.880]  So you gotta, like, try to stay out.
[10:51.160 --> 10:54.900]  And I don't believe any of that stuff, but I also fully believe all of it.
[10:55.940 --> 11:00.280]  So, as soon as I hurt myself, the first thing I thought was fucking dragons.
[11:00.620 --> 11:02.240]  This is... I gotta... I gotta be careful.
[11:02.860 --> 11:03.880]  We're in the dragon year.
[11:03.960 --> 11:05.480]  This is gonna be your pain for me, potentially.
[11:05.600 --> 11:06.180]  I gotta lay low.
[11:06.600 --> 11:08.140]  I can't believe you're a dragon.
[11:08.640 --> 11:11.080]  Yeah, you wouldn't... you wouldn't look... you wouldn't know it to look at me.
[11:11.160 --> 11:11.380]  What?
[11:11.840 --> 11:12.200]  No.
[11:12.860 --> 11:13.580]  I don't know that phrase.
[11:13.620 --> 11:14.380]  You know any of these guys?
[11:15.900 --> 11:16.240]  Uh, no.
[11:18.720 --> 11:22.040]  You and I played, uh, cricket recently.
[11:23.140 --> 11:29.420]  Would you consider football as, like... that's also another... I'd say European sport, right?
[11:29.440 --> 11:33.480]  What else do you... is polo... I feel like polo is, like, a proper British thing.
[11:34.640 --> 11:35.120]  Golf.
[11:36.480 --> 11:38.380]  Just normal golf you think is British?
[11:38.780 --> 11:39.680]  Well, it's Scottish, isn't it?
[11:39.760 --> 11:40.060]  Golf?
[11:40.860 --> 11:42.520]  I guess, yeah, but I don't know.
[11:42.540 --> 11:45.100]  Rugby was invented in Rugby, which is in England.
[11:47.140 --> 11:52.040]  I guess it's, like, you don't necessarily think of basketball as a Canadian sport, but it was made in Canada.
[11:52.400 --> 11:52.680]  Oh, really?
[11:52.720 --> 11:59.660]  I don't think necessarily where it was made, uh, details exactly, like, culturally where it's aligned.
[12:00.780 --> 12:04.060]  Like, hockey undeniably Canadian, but I would say basketball is American.
[12:05.980 --> 12:07.420]  Yeah, seems bigger in America.
[12:09.240 --> 12:13.180]  I was just trying to think of other British games that we could play that I could try to beat you at.
[12:13.720 --> 12:16.980]  I looked and they don't have a polo game, which is shocking.
[12:17.240 --> 12:18.380]  Do they have a croquet game?
[12:21.340 --> 12:22.220]  I don't...
[12:23.120 --> 12:24.480]  Let me look it up.
[12:27.060 --> 12:28.480]  A video game.
[12:29.440 --> 12:33.480]  It's just mini golf croquet, essentially, right? Like, there's no... well, there's one on Steam.
[12:34.800 --> 12:37.400]  I don't think there's ever been a console croquet game.
[12:37.520 --> 12:37.860]  Oh!
[12:39.060 --> 12:39.500]  Oh!
[12:39.860 --> 12:40.580]  Wait a second.
[12:43.240 --> 12:45.360]  It is on console. Does it have online multiplayer?
[12:47.820 --> 12:52.080]  Made by Top Secret Studios, which makes sense as to why you can't find it.
[12:52.580 --> 12:53.860]  Yeah, it's a secret thing.
[12:54.140 --> 12:57.020]  Oh my God, Gavin, this... this game.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.320]  This looks like something. There's no way.
[13:01.260 --> 13:02.700]  Oh, it's just local multiplayer.
[13:04.640 --> 13:07.140]  Damn. Well, maybe we'll look into this more.
[13:07.220 --> 13:09.520]  Maybe when there's an office day, you guys can play it.
[13:11.200 --> 13:12.460]  You challenge somebody else to.
[13:13.320 --> 13:14.720]  The national game.
[13:19.300 --> 13:27.480]  Oh, Bedard. Do you know anything about Conor Bedard, Gavin?
[13:28.100 --> 13:28.340]  No.
[13:29.120 --> 13:34.700]  Conor Bedard is the hockey player that was drafted first overall in the most recent draft.
[13:34.920 --> 13:39.920]  And he is known as, like, an all-star. He is... he is supposed to be a generational talent.
[13:40.660 --> 13:49.040]  And he is part of my favorite drama story of 2023, where they brought in this veteran player named Corey Perry.
[13:49.320 --> 13:57.920]  That management said at the time he was brought in, intended to be sort of like a father figure for Bedard to guide him in his rookie season.
[13:58.140 --> 14:01.600]  Sort of... sort of show him the ropes, you may say.
[14:01.940 --> 14:06.820]  And then, suddenly, in the middle of the season, or early in the season, I guess.
[14:08.080 --> 14:10.700]  He... Corey Perry was released from the team.
[14:11.580 --> 14:21.200]  And the rumor that generated online instantly was that Corey Perry fucked Bedard's mom during the all-moms trip when they were with the team.
[14:21.520 --> 14:23.480]  And that is why he was released by the team.
[14:24.020 --> 14:32.860]  It was a big story for a while, and people have denied that that's the case, but I continue to believe that he fucked Bedard's mom.
[14:32.980 --> 14:33.940]  I mean, you would hope so, right?
[14:34.420 --> 14:37.000]  You would... I mean, it would be so great if he did!
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.380]  Apparently, it was something related with alcohol. I don't think the full story has ever truly come out.
[14:42.860 --> 14:46.620]  But he... Corey Perry just got re-signed to a different team over this weekend.
[14:47.120 --> 14:48.880]  So, he's back... he's back on the field.
[14:50.760 --> 14:54.360]  Or, I guess, ice. Nobody says... there's not really a field in hockey. That was a bad...
[14:55.640 --> 14:57.140]  Well, in field hockey, there's a field.
[14:57.820 --> 14:58.440]  That's true.
[14:58.880 --> 15:00.760]  Which I just... call hockey.
[15:02.060 --> 15:03.860]  Oh, really? That's your default hockey?
[15:04.120 --> 15:05.260]  Yeah, hockey for me is like...
[15:06.320 --> 15:12.140]  being cold on a school morning, whipping people's shins with wooden sticks.
[15:12.340 --> 15:16.840]  And every time two sticks hit, it vibrated my hands in the cold. It sucked!
[15:17.460 --> 15:19.820]  Wait, wait, wait! They're doing the double fronts!
[15:21.880 --> 15:24.420]  Is there an update on this? Are we doing this?
[15:25.960 --> 15:27.720]  Or is he just showing off the double fronts?
[15:28.440 --> 15:32.740]  Oh, I think he's just showing off the double fronts.
[15:32.960 --> 15:34.140]  How are they together so well?
[15:35.740 --> 15:37.220]  It's... I don't know.
[15:39.640 --> 15:43.960]  I love your idea of the inside-out shirts as well.
[15:44.060 --> 15:46.240]  There's an image on...
[15:46.240 --> 15:47.780]  on everything.
[15:48.440 --> 15:49.400]  It's too back.
[15:50.480 --> 15:52.120]  It's so dumb.
[15:55.480 --> 15:57.700]  The back design is always such a...
[15:57.700 --> 16:00.720]  thrown-together thing. There's so much little effort.
[16:01.080 --> 16:03.560]  The least effort is always put in the back design.
[16:03.780 --> 16:05.620]  The idea that it's double backs is so funny.
[16:06.160 --> 16:07.400]  Backpack would be great on a hoodie.
[16:09.020 --> 16:10.660]  Backpack would be really funny on a hoodie.
[16:16.560 --> 16:24.760]  I think it would be really funny if it was like...
[16:24.760 --> 16:28.340]  front and back, and then maybe my mustache face on one of the inside.
[16:28.520 --> 16:30.060]  Just the most horrific...
[16:30.560 --> 16:33.160]  No matter what way you put it on, it's a nightmare.
[16:36.860 --> 16:39.480]  I guess people haven't seen the front-front shirt, right?
[16:39.480 --> 16:42.340]  That doesn't look bad. He just looks like he works somewhere.
[16:43.500 --> 16:45.440]  He does. He works at that bar.
[16:46.120 --> 16:48.400]  He looks like an NPC in a Hitman game.
[16:48.660 --> 16:48.900]  Yeah.
[16:49.020 --> 16:51.940]  He's just a guy walking around that's doing electrical stuff.
[16:52.140 --> 16:54.300]  He's the guy that you could just shove down a manhole
[16:54.300 --> 16:55.980]  and it wouldn't have any impact on the mission.
[16:56.520 --> 16:57.000]  Yeah.
[16:57.260 --> 17:00.560]  He is the guy you used to get the outfit to enter the area.
[17:00.740 --> 17:02.340]  To first start the level.
[17:02.860 --> 17:05.040]  The poor bastard they've got leaning over a crate.
[17:06.220 --> 17:07.880]  Funcing around without any witnesses.
[17:09.380 --> 17:12.700]  I never thought about that, but there are absolutely those guys
[17:13.120 --> 17:14.760]  in every level of Hitman.
[17:14.860 --> 17:16.880]  I wonder creatively, that must be so fun.
[17:17.220 --> 17:20.100]  Being like, okay, so who is this bastard that we're gonna leave here?
[17:20.280 --> 17:21.760]  Who's the sorriest bastard?
[17:22.400 --> 17:23.640]  We should walk around each map
[17:23.640 --> 17:25.740]  and find the sorriest bastard in every map.
[17:25.740 --> 17:27.180]  That's such a funny idea.
[17:28.640 --> 17:30.220]  Let's do that. We can compare.
[17:30.500 --> 17:32.980]  Maybe we scout and show each other who we think
[17:32.980 --> 17:35.460]  and see if we agree on who the sorriest bastard is.
[17:35.540 --> 17:36.200]  We should do that.
[17:36.660 --> 17:37.660]  Oh, that's so funny.
[17:40.560 --> 17:44.100]  Does Xbox still... Remember when you could snap in a different app?
[17:44.960 --> 17:48.340]  No, they got rid of that. They got rid of that a long time ago because no one used it.
[17:49.000 --> 17:50.440]  Well, I feel like people would have used it,
[17:50.440 --> 17:53.060]  but it turned the frame rate of the game down that you were playing.
[17:53.860 --> 17:55.860]  It also wasn't big enough.
[17:56.480 --> 18:00.880]  It was a panel and you'd get a postage stamp of the panel
[18:00.880 --> 18:02.580]  would be what your screen would be.
[18:02.640 --> 18:05.840]  It made no sense that it was the whole height of the screen
[18:05.840 --> 18:09.740]  when all you needed was a PIP situation.
[18:10.440 --> 18:13.200]  Yeah, if they could have made it adjustable, that would have been amazing.
[18:15.360 --> 18:17.880]  Why do you ask? You're just thinking split screen?
[18:18.880 --> 18:20.560]  Yeah, like being able to look up stuff
[18:22.940 --> 18:25.260]  as they pull stuff, like who that woman was.
[18:27.380 --> 18:29.080]  Oh, for me, I see what you're saying.
[18:29.400 --> 18:31.080]  Yeah, no, that's long gone.
[18:32.300 --> 18:34.380]  It's weird the stuff they took out.
[18:36.880 --> 18:38.480]  Yeah, it's like...
[18:38.480 --> 18:43.220]  The fact that the Kinect just doesn't work at all on modern consoles is such a strange thing.
[18:43.480 --> 18:45.900]  But there was never a good replacement for the voice thing.
[18:45.900 --> 18:49.960]  Being able to turn your Xbox on and off by talking, that was pretty good.
[18:50.920 --> 18:54.800]  I never used it, but I know a lot of people like you that loved it.
[18:55.880 --> 18:57.960]  You know what else they got rid of that they should have never?
[18:58.500 --> 19:00.000]  They got rid of speaking of voices.
[19:00.460 --> 19:06.260]  Do you remember on the original Xbox for Xbox Live, you could do voice masking?
[19:06.840 --> 19:09.080]  That they had a built-in voice mask you could do?
[19:11.360 --> 19:12.960]  Could you really? I don't remember that.
[19:12.960 --> 19:14.180]  Yeah, you don't remember that?
[19:14.180 --> 19:20.820]  It was part of the advertising for it, where they don't know what the future will be, but they're trying to guess.
[19:21.280 --> 19:22.620]  And one of the angles was like,
[19:22.840 --> 19:27.640]  You could play games online and hide your identity so they don't even recognize your voice.
[19:27.940 --> 19:30.420]  And it was just the shittiest voice masker.
[19:30.860 --> 19:32.580]  It was like, if you tried, it would be like,
[19:33.220 --> 19:35.680]  The robot defeated the flag.
[19:36.340 --> 19:38.060]  The flag of war is still gone.
[19:38.340 --> 19:40.700]  Like it was just muffled and sounded like shit.
[19:42.440 --> 19:44.140]  Off to send it to you, a clip of it.
[19:44.140 --> 19:46.480]  I'm sure there's someone's clipped what that thing said.
[19:46.580 --> 19:48.400]  It was like they're trying to do a Darth Vader thing.
[19:48.580 --> 19:49.400]  And it sounded awful.
[19:52.990 --> 19:56.930]  We need to come up with a list of things that Xbox needs to bring back.
[19:58.410 --> 19:59.170]  We got two.
[19:59.290 --> 20:02.250]  We want the snap feature in, we need voice masking back.
[20:04.530 --> 20:07.330]  Oh, it's so shit.
[20:08.550 --> 20:11.590]  I can't even call it the snap feature now, because it's the Switch now.
[20:11.590 --> 20:14.310]  The Switch owns the word snap, I would say.
[20:15.390 --> 20:16.250]  They snap.
[20:17.590 --> 20:18.030]  Exclusively.
[20:18.050 --> 20:19.630]  Have you not watched like a Nintendo Direct?
[20:19.850 --> 20:22.830]  Like they're constantly fucking snapping their fingers between games.
[20:23.350 --> 20:23.570]  No.
[20:24.450 --> 20:25.490]  Really? Oh my god.
[20:26.290 --> 20:27.790]  You're missing out on all the snap content.
[20:28.250 --> 20:29.770]  Yeah, I'm behind on my snap.
[20:34.450 --> 20:36.890]  It would be really cool...
[20:37.470 --> 20:39.770]  I don't know, but it would be really cool...
[20:39.770 --> 20:44.830]  If you went to a baseball game, didn't know they were taking a photo, and found yourself in the background.
[20:45.350 --> 20:47.390]  Like if you just opened a pack...
[20:47.390 --> 20:51.610]  Yeah, and you just found your out-of-focus sweaty hot dog eating face in the background.
[20:51.850 --> 20:54.790]  Hey, that's me. That guy in all blue, that's a guy.
[21:01.950 --> 21:06.030]  You know how sometimes they pitch a ball and it just obliterates a pigeon that's flying by?
[21:06.650 --> 21:06.990]  Yeah.
[21:07.130 --> 21:08.370]  I wonder if that ever made it on a card.
[21:09.790 --> 21:10.390]  Oh.
[21:12.050 --> 21:14.650]  A one of 25 pigeon feathers.
[21:18.750 --> 21:22.010]  Something about that baseball helmet makes Eric look really tiny.
[21:24.090 --> 21:28.170]  It like has shifted his entire perspective, like his profile.
[21:30.770 --> 21:35.030]  Maybe that's just me, but I feel like he's shrunken in size when putting on that helmet.
[21:37.910 --> 21:39.850]  Yeah, they gotta wait right to the end.
[21:41.390 --> 21:42.070]  Yeah, they said that.
[21:43.490 --> 21:45.170]  But now I'm starting to believe them.
[21:46.370 --> 21:48.310]  You didn't believe it from the beginning?
[21:49.130 --> 21:49.510]  Oh, wow.
[21:58.610 --> 22:04.890]  Have you used the twisty straw or whatever? What is the name of those crazy straws?
[22:04.890 --> 22:07.750]  I have not used it yet. Didn't you say it was dog shit?
[22:08.950 --> 22:11.470]  Well, it's like, it works as intended.
[22:13.530 --> 22:15.690]  I really want us to try to race using it.
[22:17.210 --> 22:18.530]  Yeah, a full Gerpler chug?
[22:19.210 --> 22:21.330]  A full Gerpler chug I think would be really funny.
[22:22.270 --> 22:27.350]  Also, Gracie has an Minnesota chug, and I feel like then it's a must if you're gonna be involved with us.
[22:27.690 --> 22:29.550]  Yeah, I wanna just do like Gracie's Gauntlet.
[22:30.370 --> 22:30.670]  Yeah.
[22:33.190 --> 22:34.690]  Gracie's Gauntlet is a great name for it.
[22:34.890 --> 22:36.590]  And he's like, I'm gonna accommodate you.
[22:37.610 --> 22:42.750]  Oh, I'm an idiot. I gotta rewind back. I never hit record on the capture.
[22:43.610 --> 22:44.390]  That was foolish.
[22:45.370 --> 22:45.610]  Yeah, it was.
[22:50.210 --> 22:51.430]  I'm doing that right now.
[22:51.950 --> 22:52.590]  And we're back to live.
[22:54.170 --> 22:55.270]  It's a great feature, that.
[22:56.110 --> 22:59.350]  Oh, I would be, we would have lost so many videos.
[23:00.610 --> 23:06.230]  Speaking of which, did you ever find the Halo 2 thing that we made, like, in August?
[23:08.770 --> 23:10.450]  Uh, yeah. It was on an iPad.
[23:11.550 --> 23:12.570]  Oh, that's awesome.
[23:13.090 --> 23:19.570]  I was gonna export it the other day, and then my subscription to Final Cut on iPad has expired, so I need to renew it.
[23:19.570 --> 23:19.950]  No!
[23:21.690 --> 23:25.570]  So you have to get a new subscription to get that video off of it?
[23:25.570 --> 23:28.570]  I basically have to pay to export a video I edited a month ago.
[23:29.350 --> 23:32.030]  Oh my god. How much is it?
[23:33.210 --> 23:37.210]  Uh, I think it's like 15 bucks a month or something.
[23:37.690 --> 23:38.590]  Okay, that's not bad.
[23:38.930 --> 23:39.410]  Not too bad.
[23:40.110 --> 23:41.650]  Is Final Cut, do they do...
[23:42.210 --> 23:42.870]  It was a free trial.
[23:43.110 --> 23:43.850]  Just, you can buy it out?
[23:45.550 --> 23:46.270]  I don't know.
[23:46.510 --> 23:53.030]  Because, like, the last time I got a Mac, I had it installed on it, and I had to pay, like, an additional 400 or whatever to have it in.
[23:53.350 --> 23:55.710]  Yeah, on the Mac, it's like a $300 one-off.
[23:55.710 --> 23:58.710]  Isn't Longoria related to Eva Longoria? Like, Eva and Evan?
[23:59.110 --> 23:59.690]  Oh, I see.
[24:00.190 --> 24:01.950]  But iPad is like a...
[24:01.950 --> 24:08.590]  It's a newer product, and nobody wants you to own anything anymore. They want you to rent it.
[24:08.770 --> 24:15.550]  I don't mind it for games, only because you need online connectivity for games.
[24:16.330 --> 24:22.170]  Like, the idea that, like, owning your games physically preserves them in some way just doesn't work anymore.
[24:22.750 --> 24:23.230]  Right.
[24:23.230 --> 24:26.670]  Like it did on, like, the Super Nintendo or whatever. GameCube.
[24:28.250 --> 24:29.390]  But everything else, that sucks with.
[24:29.910 --> 24:32.010]  I love Game Pass, but...
[24:32.010 --> 24:38.290]  Isn't it crazy that they used to ship cartridges, which were very expensive to make, and then that was it? Like, you couldn't patch it.
[24:39.270 --> 24:40.610]  You had to just nail it.
[24:41.390 --> 24:41.830]  Yeah.
[24:42.250 --> 24:48.430]  It's like people, whenever a game gets delayed, likes to... people like to post that thing of, uh...
[24:48.430 --> 24:49.670]  What's his name? The Mario guy?
[24:50.570 --> 24:52.510]  The quote that isn't his, where it's like...
[24:53.330 --> 24:57.990]  If you... a delayed game is only delayed for a time, but a broken game remains broken.
[24:58.750 --> 25:00.110]  It's not how that works now.
[25:00.610 --> 25:02.790]  That's so not true. That doesn't apply.
[25:03.150 --> 25:03.350]  Yeah.
[25:03.490 --> 25:03.870]  At all.
[25:09.250 --> 25:11.390]  Oh, we got Japanese Donald Duck.
[25:14.130 --> 25:16.490]  This is some Jack shit. I don't know anything about this.
[25:16.490 --> 25:16.850]  What's going on?
[25:19.830 --> 25:21.710]  What was I gonna talk...
[25:21.710 --> 25:24.230]  What were we talking about a minute ago? We were talking about...
[25:24.230 --> 25:25.930]  They had an animated Atom?
[25:30.010 --> 25:33.650]  I don't know what that is.
[25:35.530 --> 25:37.010]  Beep, beep, the Atom.
[25:40.370 --> 25:42.510]  It's no Ratty Boy. I'll tell you that much.
[25:44.730 --> 25:46.570]  Oh, we never got an update on Ratty Boy.
[25:48.870 --> 25:51.050]  I don't know when this will come out, so I can't...
[25:51.050 --> 25:52.710]  Okay. Is that for Thursday?
[25:52.730 --> 25:53.490]  But I do have one.
[25:57.610 --> 25:59.310]  I feel like that's offensive.
[26:00.950 --> 26:04.750]  I feel like that's the dangerous thing about doing old Disney animated stuff like this.
[26:05.470 --> 26:11.350]  I mean, I'm assuming they curated it and it's a new product, but if you were to just pull from what was acceptable at the time...
[26:12.230 --> 26:15.030]  I guess you'd have to look at it with the eyes of the time.
[26:17.350 --> 26:20.090]  That doesn't always work though, depending on the content.
[26:21.310 --> 26:23.890]  You cannot always trust the eyes of even the time.
[26:25.430 --> 26:27.290]  Based on what is no longer on Disney+.
[26:28.650 --> 26:30.290]  Yeah, that's a good measuring stick.
[26:33.550 --> 26:36.570]  Fuck, I'm so mad. I was excited to talk to you about something.
[26:37.130 --> 26:38.410]  Was it the Beagle Boys?
[26:39.950 --> 26:41.530]  It was the Beagle Boys.
[26:41.530 --> 26:46.070]  So this is kind of like the book we did, where it's like one group of Asian dudes.
[26:46.930 --> 26:55.150]  I learned last night, and I'm going to test it when we're done here, that there's a thing on EA, EA Sports Games, called Game Face.
[26:55.530 --> 26:59.230]  You know how you could scan your face for Rainbow Six Vegas in the past?
[26:59.710 --> 27:10.630]  EA, and I've never seen anyone talk about this, has a thing called Game Face where you can scan a photo of your face and then use it as creative characters.
[27:10.630 --> 27:12.930]  Well Geoff did that, didn't he, in that basketball game?
[27:14.250 --> 27:17.270]  He did, but that was like a phone app thing, I think.
[27:18.070 --> 27:26.930]  This is like, you save a photo online, and then you can import your creative fighter UFC using the face that you scanned on your computer.
[27:29.930 --> 27:33.390]  We have some things we could possibly do with that, that I'm very excited about.
[27:41.980 --> 27:43.820]  Have you played Trucks recently?
[27:44.360 --> 27:44.800]  No.
[27:45.000 --> 27:46.400]  I haven't done anything recently.
[27:47.100 --> 27:49.520]  I've been just a little...
[27:49.520 --> 27:50.960]  a little editor.
[27:51.720 --> 27:53.160]  A little editing man?
[27:53.460 --> 27:55.500]  Yeah, just a tiny little man editing.
[27:56.440 --> 28:01.380]  Do you still have a lot more editing work to do, or have you kind of crossed over where you can do some editing?
[28:02.200 --> 28:05.800]  As of last night, at 2am, I'm not an editing man.
[28:06.160 --> 28:07.480]  God, hell yeah man!
[28:07.820 --> 28:08.760]  At least for a week.
[28:10.760 --> 28:12.440]  What are you going to do with this new time?
[28:15.620 --> 28:16.020]  Um...
[28:16.020 --> 28:16.880]  I've got to clean.
[28:18.240 --> 28:18.640]  Clean?
[28:19.200 --> 28:20.220]  Yeah, I've got to do some cleaning.
[28:22.160 --> 28:22.880]  I get so behind.
[28:24.420 --> 28:28.240]  Oh yeah, that's actually, that'll relate to my injury. It's funny.
[28:29.000 --> 28:29.920]  It was a cleaning injury?
[28:30.620 --> 28:33.980]  Maybe. I don't know, I'm not going to spoil anything. Maybe that had a factor in it.
[28:33.980 --> 28:39.680]  See, now I'm imagining you as a cartoon slipping on a mop, and you end up standing on the mop.
[28:39.800 --> 28:44.780]  But the slick of the mop ends up sliding around the room and you're just riding in the mop.
[28:49.100 --> 28:52.900]  I don't think that happened.
[28:53.680 --> 28:56.280]  And then a bucket falls on your head and you can't see.
[28:59.240 --> 29:01.300]  Turns out I'm in Kevin McAllister's house.
[29:06.020 --> 29:11.140]  I would rather accidentally break into the Terminator's house than Kevin McAllister's house.
[29:11.980 --> 29:13.740]  I don't think the Terminator has a house.
[29:14.120 --> 29:15.000]  That's a good point.
[29:16.580 --> 29:21.000]  If there's any movie character that doesn't need a house, it's probably the Terminator.
[29:21.420 --> 29:23.340]  Yeah, that was a terrible example.
[29:26.000 --> 29:30.220]  Do you ever think about...
[29:30.220 --> 29:31.800]  Oh, is it the Hellraiser box?
[29:31.800 --> 29:33.700]  I think so.
[29:40.000 --> 29:46.060]  If you get killed by any famous movie character, fight them. Maybe you kill them.
[29:46.780 --> 29:47.320]  Who do you pick?
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.400]  A movie character that I can kill?
[29:50.100 --> 29:50.640]  Yeah.
[29:51.280 --> 29:52.280]  The Predator.
[29:54.580 --> 29:55.120]  Sauron.
[29:56.280 --> 29:56.820]  Really?
[29:57.940 --> 30:00.780]  I'd climb up that tower and I'd poke him in the eye.
[30:02.100 --> 30:03.560]  Where it's like...
[30:04.900 --> 30:06.740]  That giant flaming eye?
[30:07.060 --> 30:07.240]  Yeah.
[30:10.120 --> 30:18.300]  Do you ever see those Ben Stein commercials for the eye irritant drops?
[30:19.000 --> 30:19.480]  No.
[30:21.340 --> 30:23.220]  I haven't thought about those in a long time.
[30:23.340 --> 30:28.620]  It's like him being very boring on a beach, but it's like if you use these eye drops, your eyes won't hurt anymore.
[30:29.080 --> 30:31.360]  Just imagining like an eye drop ad with Sauron.
[30:31.800 --> 30:35.160]  Was that a giant bucket of drops?
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.980]  Was that Ben Stein's real voice or was he putting that on?
[30:39.780 --> 30:41.180]  That's a great question.
[30:41.300 --> 30:42.760]  I've never heard him not do that.
[30:43.600 --> 30:45.020]  Yeah, I assume it's his voice.
[30:46.860 --> 30:48.080]  Wasn't he also in the mask?
[30:48.880 --> 30:49.840]  Was he?
[30:51.440 --> 30:57.080]  I mainly think of him as when Ben Stein's money. Let me look up what Ben Stein's IMDB is up to.
[30:57.080 --> 30:58.280]  It's like a new candy.
[31:00.960 --> 31:03.460]  Most known for Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
[31:05.140 --> 31:10.800]  I feel like if he is putting on a fake voice, that movie defined his entire personality.
[31:18.040 --> 31:19.860]  What is this from?
[31:20.840 --> 31:26.020]  He was in Son of the Mask and The Mask. He's in both. He might be the only character in both films.
[31:27.080 --> 31:35.860]  I think he's talking to Stanley about how it's the mask of Loki and what that means and all that mischief.
[31:35.960 --> 31:37.860]  I don't remember any of that.
[31:38.080 --> 31:40.820]  But it doesn't work. You can't put it on in front of him.
[31:41.900 --> 31:45.680]  You can tell he's not... oh, he has 80 acting credits.
[31:46.600 --> 31:49.280]  The things he's known for are definitely smaller roles.
[31:50.080 --> 31:55.700]  He's known for four things. Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Mask, Son of the Mask, and Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.
[31:56.600 --> 32:02.740]  And his roles in two of those are economics teacher and Wichita Airport representative.
[32:03.120 --> 32:08.040]  Like, very clearly, characters that don't even have names.
[32:10.340 --> 32:11.560]  He was in Married with Children.
[32:13.800 --> 32:16.840]  I'm going to... because I know I have my phone near me.
[32:17.200 --> 32:23.740]  I'm going to slack you right now one of the top photo for Ben Stein when you go on his IMDB page.
[32:24.540 --> 32:25.060]  Okay.
[32:26.300 --> 32:31.920]  I would argue that it's the best photo I've seen. I don't know if maybe it changes every time you load his page.
[32:32.300 --> 32:38.320]  I hope not. I hope that everyone that looks up Ben Stein's IMDB is greeted with this beautiful...
[32:39.000 --> 32:42.020]  That's not what I meant to send at all.
[32:42.380 --> 32:45.080]  Delete message before you look at it.
[32:45.240 --> 32:48.180]  Oh, there's... I got a sneak peek of something.
[32:49.120 --> 32:50.080]  Got a little sneak.
[32:51.040 --> 32:53.160]  You're having some sloppy pastes recently.
[32:53.160 --> 32:55.700]  I'm having some sloppy pastes. You're right.
[32:55.900 --> 32:59.460]  There we go. Look at that. Look at that beauty.
[32:59.580 --> 33:02.020]  Ben Stein in a chicken suit.
[33:02.680 --> 33:05.800]  Is he like the guardian of dog heaven?
[33:06.740 --> 33:10.480]  I think so. I have no idea.
[33:11.520 --> 33:13.800]  He's like the puppy heaven administrator.
[33:18.160 --> 33:20.780]  Episode Requiem for a Dead Briar.
[33:21.500 --> 33:25.180]  Oh, this is... This episode just keeps on giving.
[33:25.960 --> 33:26.900]  When you go to the...
[33:28.800 --> 33:33.060]  This is the image gathered when you open the specific episode on IMDB.
[33:33.460 --> 33:37.040]  Just a close-up of his face with the chicken mask on.
[33:37.760 --> 33:38.160]  Wow.
[33:39.820 --> 33:41.520]  Wow. Beautiful. Is he alive?
[33:45.780 --> 33:48.200]  Get to the nuggets! Listen to Eric!
[33:48.200 --> 33:51.360]  Get to the... They have 15 nuggets to open, Geoff.
[33:51.960 --> 33:54.520]  You're more than halfway through this fucking stream.
[33:55.580 --> 33:58.460]  I missed all the cheerleaders looking at pictures of Ben Stein as a chicken.
[33:59.120 --> 34:01.420]  Yeah, but you got to come back in for trolls.
[34:01.720 --> 34:01.920]  That's true.
[34:04.560 --> 34:05.040]  JockoFox.
[34:09.620 --> 34:13.580]  Freddy Fibber looks and feels like a character you would come up with, Gavin.
[34:13.960 --> 34:15.700]  That'd be like a Stuart for you.
[34:15.700 --> 34:19.420]  Like, if Stuart was personified, it's Freddy Fibber.
[34:23.040 --> 34:26.640]  Why is he holding it behind the picture of Emily and Eric?
[34:27.300 --> 34:29.080]  Because Geoff sucks at this.
[34:36.180 --> 34:40.660]  I mean, in fairness, this is a PTZ cam, so they could just pan it.
[34:42.060 --> 34:44.380]  Oh, you're gonna get me in jack trouble again.
[34:45.380 --> 34:46.980]  My filming ignorance.
[34:48.120 --> 34:50.380]  Not knowing that there's an alternate solution.
[34:53.760 --> 34:58.260]  I actually kind of love these cards. These are so shitty in the best way.
[35:02.400 --> 35:04.520]  Why am I...
[35:06.200 --> 35:07.040]  Why are you what?
[35:08.060 --> 35:09.400]  Why am I watching on my own feed?
[35:10.120 --> 35:13.380]  I don't know, I'm watching on the shared feed.
[35:13.380 --> 35:15.120]  Yeah, I just had it next... I had two up.
[35:19.280 --> 35:23.420]  I keep doing the same thing, I'm gonna be honest, but I'm trying to remember to look at the main screen.
[35:28.900 --> 35:29.260]  Wait...
[35:29.260 --> 35:31.500]  Buck... Do you know who Buck the dog is?
[35:32.140 --> 35:34.860]  Is that a famous dog, or is that just in...
[35:34.860 --> 35:40.240]  Because the plot of the episode is Buck the dog dies in heaven, he is sent back to Earth as the Bundy's new dog, Lucky.
[35:41.420 --> 35:42.120]  Ted Bundy?
[35:43.380 --> 35:44.220]  Are you anti-troll?
[35:45.440 --> 35:50.300]  No, I don't think Ted Bundy was part of the Bundy family, shockingly.
[35:50.640 --> 35:54.720]  Married with Children would be a very different show if Ted Bundy was one of the kids.
[35:54.880 --> 35:55.900]  Theodore Bundy.
[35:57.860 --> 36:01.680]  Yeah, Bud Bundy, Al Bundy, Peggy Bundy, Kelly Bundy.
[36:02.700 --> 36:03.820]  No Ted.
[36:09.280 --> 36:11.000]  Nobody cares about 2012.
[36:12.820 --> 36:14.600]  Get to the Nugget Buddies!
[36:16.020 --> 36:18.080]  What if he doesn't get to it this episode?
[36:20.520 --> 36:21.320]  I will...
[36:21.920 --> 36:25.060]  I hate that you suggested that, because that feels very possible.
[36:25.380 --> 36:28.740]  That is, that would be the absolute Geoff thing to do.
[36:28.980 --> 36:30.860]  Yeah, if he pulled a Geoff.
[36:33.340 --> 36:34.640]  Yeah, oh my god.
[36:34.900 --> 36:39.240]  Yeah, if he like Matt Damon's me, and is like, well, I ran out of time, we'll do it next time.
[36:40.020 --> 36:44.500]  And you know, the worst part is, is that like, he would have constructed this the entire time.
[36:44.700 --> 36:50.020]  I can see fucking Geoff being like, oh, I'm gonna, let's do a bit where we pretend that we forget,
[36:50.140 --> 36:52.460]  and then we throw it away, because he knows I'm recording this.
[36:52.700 --> 36:56.360]  Well, why don't we just pretend, if that happens, we'll just pretend we forgot.
[36:57.100 --> 36:58.240]  That's a great idea.
[36:59.440 --> 37:02.560]  I did ask Nick about it, and I think Nick is in the room right now.
[37:03.800 --> 37:04.720]  Oh, in that room?
[37:05.660 --> 37:11.300]  Yeah, I think that's why he's not here with us, is that he had to go into the office, I think, to be part of this.
[37:11.500 --> 37:15.420]  I mean, maybe if he doesn't get around to it, I could just go there, and force him.
[37:18.380 --> 37:19.820]  I'll slack Nick right now.
[37:24.060 --> 37:26.640]  Are you in the room?
[37:26.900 --> 37:29.960]  Because Eric probably isn't gonna check his phone.
[37:34.800 --> 37:35.600]  What's his deal?
[37:40.100 --> 37:44.080]  I just realized I messaged Nick, are you in the room, but in no other context.
[37:48.860 --> 37:50.260]  I'm gonna guess the answer is yes.
[37:51.320 --> 37:52.900]  He's definitely in a room.
[37:53.640 --> 37:54.840]  What are these creatures?
[37:57.080 --> 37:57.620]  What's a pliff?
[38:00.880 --> 38:01.680]  Year 2000.
[38:05.360 --> 38:08.120]  Oh, these are like dollar store Pokemon.
[38:13.140 --> 38:14.200]  Smite 2!
[38:14.780 --> 38:16.440]  They made a second Smite?
[38:17.200 --> 38:17.820]  Yeah, they did.
[38:18.160 --> 38:22.000]  Skip all my controllers off!
[38:22.540 --> 38:24.040]  We're watching too much of the ad.
[38:26.380 --> 38:27.500]  Edit that!
[38:29.360 --> 38:31.060]  Sponsored by Smite 2.
[38:32.660 --> 38:34.160]  What takes Smite 2 money?
[38:36.520 --> 38:39.160]  I actually liked the first Smite, it just was beyond me.
[38:39.560 --> 38:41.500]  I felt like I got in too late to Smite.
[38:42.720 --> 38:44.740]  I don't enjoy any of those games.
[38:46.180 --> 38:47.820]  They're just not my bag, you know?
[38:48.100 --> 38:49.400]  You're not a MOBA guy?
[38:49.540 --> 38:50.020]  Not really.
[38:51.100 --> 38:52.280]  I tried and I sucked.
[38:55.220 --> 38:57.180]  Have you ever switched on a genre?
[38:57.400 --> 39:00.900]  Like you spent most of your life hating it, and something happened?
[39:02.080 --> 39:03.480]  Oh, RPGs.
[39:04.700 --> 39:05.160]  Oh, really?
[39:05.680 --> 39:08.020]  Well, not like true RPGs, but like Bethesda.
[39:10.900 --> 39:11.940]  Like Morrowind?
[39:12.660 --> 39:15.840]  Yeah, I hated looking at Morrowind.
[39:16.060 --> 39:19.560]  I felt like Oblivion was an absolute chore to get through.
[39:20.140 --> 39:21.020]  I hated it.
[39:21.360 --> 39:23.180]  And then something just switched,
[39:23.300 --> 39:25.160]  and I really enjoyed Fallout 3,
[39:25.300 --> 39:27.740]  loved Skyrim, loved New Vegas.
[39:29.320 --> 39:30.660]  I could probably go back
[39:30.660 --> 39:31.940]  and enjoy Oblivion, if I wanted.
[39:34.140 --> 39:35.280]  That's an interesting genre.
[39:36.560 --> 39:37.620]  To switch on.
[39:38.560 --> 39:40.520]  I feel like I like turn-based games,
[39:40.640 --> 39:41.740]  but I don't think I do.
[39:42.320 --> 39:44.060]  I always go through the exercise of
[39:44.060 --> 39:45.300]  going in, kind of dreading it,
[39:45.340 --> 39:47.040]  and then I eventually get the hang of it.
[39:47.140 --> 39:51.780]  I'm trying to think of the last turn-based
[39:52.440 --> 39:53.280]  game I played.
[39:54.540 --> 39:56.280]  There's a new Yakuza game coming out
[39:56.280 --> 39:58.180]  that's turn-based, and that'll probably be
[39:58.180 --> 40:00.280]  the most recent one I'll play.
[40:00.720 --> 40:02.260]  Maybe Mario and Rabbids.
[40:03.760 --> 40:06.140]  You know what? I didn't mind you saying Mario.
[40:06.380 --> 40:07.240]  That's interesting.
[40:08.180 --> 40:10.540]  Something about your accent gets away with Mario.
[40:14.940 --> 40:16.700]  Like the traditional...
[40:16.700 --> 40:18.140]  Yeah, that works!
[40:18.640 --> 40:19.460]  That's crazy!
[40:20.940 --> 40:21.820]  Wait, who is this?
[40:22.400 --> 40:23.480]  Robert Wool?
[40:26.520 --> 40:27.740]  I'm going to look up Robert Wool.
[40:31.940 --> 40:34.140]  Do you have any idea who this actor is?
[40:40.260 --> 40:41.600]  I have no idea.
[40:43.820 --> 40:44.560]  Get to the...
[40:44.560 --> 40:45.360]  Oh my god, Geoff.
[40:48.840 --> 40:49.280]  We're...
[40:49.880 --> 40:52.460]  We're getting to a point where he'll have less than one minute
[40:52.460 --> 40:53.820]  to deal with every nugget buddy.
[40:57.260 --> 40:58.620]  Oh, he's going to breeze through him
[40:58.620 --> 41:00.400]  if he gets them, I think. Do you think Alice
[41:00.400 --> 41:01.220]  is the name of their dog?
[41:03.800 --> 41:04.600]  Did you...
[41:04.600 --> 41:06.700]  Did you learn the name of their dog
[41:06.700 --> 41:08.760]  recently? Was there something that...
[41:08.760 --> 41:10.640]  Okay, I wasn't sure because you guys went over there.
[41:11.160 --> 41:12.300]  Gracie knows it, though.
[41:14.360 --> 41:15.240]  Which is bullshit.
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.580]  I wonder... I can't...
[41:19.520 --> 41:20.580]  Something will come out in
[41:20.580 --> 41:22.940]  the future that will change the audience's
[41:22.940 --> 41:24.180]  perception of Gracie.
[41:24.180 --> 41:26.020]  And I wonder if Geoff
[41:26.020 --> 41:28.580]  learning that has changed his
[41:28.580 --> 41:30.480]  confidence in letting her
[41:30.480 --> 41:32.400]  know that secret. Do I know
[41:32.400 --> 41:34.000]  this thing? Yes, you do.
[41:34.400 --> 41:36.320]  It blew us all
[41:36.320 --> 41:38.740]  away. It was shocking.
[41:38.920 --> 41:40.440]  It was a shocking confession
[41:40.440 --> 41:41.080]  by Gracie.
[41:46.300 --> 41:47.960]  When are we continuing that?
[41:49.580 --> 41:51.480]  Did you see the slack?
[41:52.540 --> 41:52.920]  About it?
[41:54.100 --> 41:54.920]  I asked.
[41:54.920 --> 41:56.860]  I asked that question.
[41:56.940 --> 41:57.960]  Are you around Wednesday?
[41:59.660 --> 42:01.380]  Okay, let's do Wednesday
[42:01.380 --> 42:02.400]  then. We'll film the next round.
[42:03.760 --> 42:05.240]  If Gavin is free
[42:05.240 --> 42:05.820]  Wednesday.
[42:08.100 --> 42:08.980]  Free everyday.
[42:11.900 --> 42:13.000]  You have been
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.140]  amazing with your availability. It's very
[42:15.140 --> 42:17.120]  appreciated. I don't know when you go. I know
[42:17.120 --> 42:18.340]  you have something coming up at some point.
[42:18.820 --> 42:20.720]  Yeah, pretty much outside of travel.
[42:23.000 --> 42:23.940]  You have been the most
[42:23.940 --> 42:26.380]  consistent person showing up to our Let's Play slot
[42:26.380 --> 42:28.460]  which has been a lot of fun and very appreciated.
[42:28.620 --> 42:31.180]  I like that we built in a Let's Play slot
[42:31.180 --> 42:33.220]  and I think Geoff's been gone
[42:33.220 --> 42:35.060]  for almost every single one
[42:35.060 --> 42:35.680]  except for one.
[42:36.860 --> 42:37.780]  And then you
[42:38.280 --> 42:40.320]  suggested maybe we change it and everyone
[42:40.320 --> 42:42.380]  said this is the best day for me.
[42:43.220 --> 42:44.000]  Yeah, I was like
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.740]  it's our standing slot
[42:45.740 --> 42:47.020]  on the wrong day.
[42:48.160 --> 42:49.040]  And everyone was like, no, it's great.
[42:53.240 --> 42:54.620]  He's gonna be out on Thursday.
[42:54.720 --> 42:56.020]  I don't know if you have plans on Thursday
[42:56.020 --> 42:58.100]  but Geoff will not be there.
[42:58.700 --> 43:00.280]  Oh, does that mean he's missing the recording too?
[43:01.720 --> 43:02.740]  The episode recording?
[43:04.640 --> 43:07.680]  No, I think he'll be done by then.
[43:07.700 --> 43:07.880]  Alright.
[43:09.880 --> 43:10.580]  I assume.
[43:10.860 --> 43:12.720]  Alright, now surely time for Nuggs.
[43:13.620 --> 43:14.720]  Has to be time for Nuggs.
[43:14.800 --> 43:15.300]  18 minutes.
[43:15.640 --> 43:16.540]  Oh my god.
[43:17.340 --> 43:18.200]  Beep beep.
[43:18.260 --> 43:19.800]  There you go.
[43:20.120 --> 43:22.400]  Oh, nice, silver prism.
[43:22.500 --> 43:23.760]  If Geoff...
[43:23.760 --> 43:24.000]  Hey!
[43:25.300 --> 43:25.860]  Laughter.
[43:28.840 --> 43:29.400]  Laughter.
[43:31.060 --> 43:32.760]  If you just tune in
[43:32.760 --> 43:33.420]  to the second half
[43:33.420 --> 43:35.980]  that would have made less sense.
[43:37.300 --> 43:38.640]  Why would anyone just tune in
[43:38.640 --> 43:39.880]  to the second half of this?
[43:40.160 --> 43:42.580]  This isn't a radio program.
[43:42.800 --> 43:44.840]  There's no...
[43:44.840 --> 43:46.720]  But you never know how people
[43:46.720 --> 43:48.240]  watch the VODs.
[43:48.640 --> 43:49.260]  That's fair.
[43:51.740 --> 43:54.420]  Fuck, what was I...
[43:54.420 --> 43:56.860]  You threw me so hard with your AIDS yell.
[43:58.940 --> 44:00.360]  Oh man. Okay.
[44:00.520 --> 44:01.260]  This is what I was gonna say.
[44:01.560 --> 44:03.680]  If Geoff doesn't get to the Nugget Buddies
[44:03.680 --> 44:06.340]  in this thing, we're coming back
[44:06.340 --> 44:08.400]  and I'm constructing
[44:08.400 --> 44:09.500]  an anti-Geoff episode.
[44:11.320 --> 44:12.920]  I'm building a YouTube playlist
[44:12.920 --> 44:14.080]  for you and I to go through.
[44:14.560 --> 44:15.640]  I'm getting my revenge.
[44:15.940 --> 44:17.920]  Do you think, if you wanted to,
[44:18.460 --> 44:19.760]  we could keep Geoff
[44:21.460 --> 44:23.360]  on a Discord call for an hour?
[44:25.180 --> 44:27.080]  Basically just like, hey, let's record a thing
[44:27.080 --> 44:29.180]  and then you get here, everyone's in
[44:29.180 --> 44:31.680]  and then you're like, oh, hold on, I just need to...
[44:31.680 --> 44:32.560]  My thing needs an update.
[44:32.880 --> 44:34.580]  And then you just keep lying and lying and lying
[44:34.580 --> 44:35.560]  until he's been here for an hour.
[44:43.520 --> 44:45.960]  I just saw that Gracie slacked me
[44:48.940 --> 44:50.140]  the description
[44:50.140 --> 44:52.080]  of what this upload will be,
[44:52.180 --> 44:53.600]  making sure I'm okay with it
[44:53.600 --> 44:54.640]  for the Nugget Buddies.
[44:55.320 --> 44:56.880]  That's almost more insulting.
[44:58.340 --> 45:00.060]  Wait, so what did she ask you?
[45:00.560 --> 45:02.020]  She slacked me
[45:02.020 --> 45:04.020]  what the episode description will be
[45:04.020 --> 45:06.260]  for this upload of this Break Show
[45:06.260 --> 45:08.120]  and it be centered around
[45:08.120 --> 45:08.840]  the Nugget Buddies.
[45:09.040 --> 45:09.120]  Oh my god.
[45:10.560 --> 45:11.420]  Making sure
[45:11.420 --> 45:12.020]  I'm good with it.
[45:14.200 --> 45:15.220]  16 minutes
[45:16.660 --> 45:17.760]  for 15
[45:17.760 --> 45:18.600]  Nugget Buddies.
[45:18.900 --> 45:20.660]  He's gonna do it with, I think,
[45:20.900 --> 45:22.320]  2 minutes 30 to go.
[45:35.840 --> 45:37.760]  Why did I do this, Gavin?
[45:38.420 --> 45:39.760]  Okay, now let me rephrase that.
[45:40.040 --> 45:42.200]  Why did I tell Geoff I was going to do this?
[45:42.340 --> 45:43.660]  Yeah, that was your first mistake.
[45:44.080 --> 45:45.120]  That was the problem.
[45:46.500 --> 45:47.540]  That was an absolute
[45:48.700 --> 45:50.180]  catastrophic failure on your part.
[45:51.280 --> 45:51.800]  What is...
[45:51.800 --> 45:53.680]  Do you have any of those that come to mind immediately
[45:53.680 --> 45:56.040]  of like, you told Geoff a thing and immediately
[45:56.040 --> 45:57.300]  went, oh, that was a mistake.
[45:58.360 --> 46:00.060]  That was not...
[46:04.160 --> 46:06.020]  I'm surprised that he has not
[46:06.020 --> 46:08.120]  used the sound effect button
[46:08.120 --> 46:10.260]  more since we showed him
[46:10.260 --> 46:11.000]  that is the thing.
[46:11.220 --> 46:13.440]  I would assume he's already forgotten.
[46:32.140 --> 46:33.560]  Oh, Ericsson is
[46:33.560 --> 46:35.260]  doing his cocky face.
[46:35.260 --> 46:37.080]  Yeah, he's doing his cocky face.
[46:37.120 --> 46:39.240]  Ericsson feels powerful. He's in a sea of power.
[46:53.690 --> 46:54.970]  Oh, the buddies!
[46:59.910 --> 47:02.430]  This is it! I've been waiting
[47:02.430 --> 47:04.550]  46... Gavin, I've been waiting weeks
[47:04.550 --> 47:07.030]  for this. Literal weeks.
[47:11.110 --> 47:12.470]  Here it is.
[47:13.290 --> 47:14.790]  After they've done talking about Friday.
[47:20.310 --> 47:20.830]  Yes!
[47:26.850 --> 47:28.170]  Okay, so I need...
[47:28.170 --> 47:29.190]  Darla, I need Kerwin.
[47:37.690 --> 47:38.650]  Gavin, I don't like
[47:38.650 --> 47:39.370]  the look of that.
[47:40.690 --> 47:41.730]  That's open.
[47:42.470 --> 47:44.390]  Yeah, I think...
[47:44.390 --> 47:46.830]  Maybe it's possible I accidentally sent one that was open.
[47:50.070 --> 47:51.350]  So you sent all these?
[47:51.870 --> 47:53.250]  I sent all of them.
[47:57.610 --> 47:58.550]  What do you mean?
[48:00.910 --> 48:02.790]  What do you mean, am I watching?
[48:04.330 --> 48:06.670]  Was Eric not there? Did he leave before
[48:06.670 --> 48:08.130]  this was established? He was there, right?
[48:08.570 --> 48:09.350]  I don't remember.
[48:09.850 --> 48:12.730]  I don't remember either. Now I'm beginning to think he doesn't know.
[48:13.490 --> 48:14.910]  Okay, so that's Uptown Moe.
[48:15.010 --> 48:15.990]  You've already got that one.
[48:16.230 --> 48:18.410]  I got that one. That was the first one I got.
[48:19.290 --> 48:20.710]  They actually sell an Uptown Moe backpack.
[48:20.990 --> 48:23.030]  Yeah, go ahead. Why do you want these?
[48:24.610 --> 48:25.690]  Because they're great.
[48:26.170 --> 48:27.110]  What do you mean?
[48:28.290 --> 48:30.270]  Did you not see any when you went to Geoff's house?
[48:30.350 --> 48:31.450]  Did you not get your hands on one?
[48:31.930 --> 48:32.930]  I saw them.
[48:34.230 --> 48:36.210]  Why does he have train tunnels for arms?
[48:37.550 --> 48:38.650]  Yeah, he's Uptown Moe.
[48:38.870 --> 48:40.790]  Okay, so what? That's 15?
[48:40.790 --> 48:41.930]  I have that one.
[48:42.050 --> 48:43.710]  I need the Kerwin Frost.
[48:48.190 --> 48:50.230]  I want to see the seals.
[48:50.550 --> 48:51.310]  I don't trust this.
[48:52.030 --> 48:53.270]  Oh, they're avoiding the shot.
[48:57.770 --> 48:59.470]  Come on. Kerwin.
[49:00.970 --> 49:03.090]  Or Darla. Either or.
[49:03.990 --> 49:05.970]  Is it wrapped in hamburger paper?
[49:05.970 --> 49:08.490]  Is it Darla? Is it Kerwin?
[49:08.770 --> 49:11.090]  No, that's not either of them.
[49:11.530 --> 49:13.430]  I have that one.
[49:15.270 --> 49:16.950]  He is terrible at this.
[49:17.570 --> 49:18.790]  He's really bad at it.
[49:18.850 --> 49:20.070]  Why do all the hairs fall off?
[49:20.850 --> 49:22.290]  You can adjust the tops.
[49:22.490 --> 49:23.410]  You can move them around.
[49:23.570 --> 49:24.870]  You can switch which is what.
[49:24.990 --> 49:27.290]  The bottoms and the tops are changeable.
[49:28.050 --> 49:31.230]  I bet people are shoving these up their ass left and right.
[49:32.110 --> 49:33.530]  Yeah, that's your immediate thought.
[49:33.690 --> 49:35.050]  I bet people are taking the hair off
[49:35.050 --> 49:36.350]  and just shoving them right up.
[49:36.670 --> 49:38.310]  Having some gold nugget action?
[49:38.750 --> 49:49.610]  I have gold.
[49:51.230 --> 49:52.590]  That's what makes this so annoying.
[49:52.910 --> 49:53.950]  I have the rare one.
[49:55.250 --> 49:57.830]  I don't like that they're not showing the seals in that shot.
[49:59.750 --> 50:00.850]  Who is this?
[50:01.430 --> 50:02.170]  It's pink.
[50:02.890 --> 50:03.910]  Oh my god, just open it.
[50:03.910 --> 50:05.330]  Oh, that's Kerwin.
[50:05.710 --> 50:06.810]  Gavin, that's Kerwin Frost.
[50:08.190 --> 50:09.390]  He's got the pencil.
[50:10.490 --> 50:11.610]  He's got the fry shoes.
[50:12.210 --> 50:12.970]  Holy shit.
[50:14.050 --> 50:14.950]  Oh my god.
[50:15.430 --> 50:16.750]  Thanks, man.
[50:26.090 --> 50:27.210]  Holy shit.
[50:28.850 --> 50:29.530]  Oh my god.
[50:29.690 --> 50:31.870]  I got like 12 more shots than Darla.
[50:32.530 --> 50:33.530]  Dude, you've got it.
[50:33.530 --> 50:34.450]  I feel really good about this.
[50:35.710 --> 50:37.310]  Why is there a pencil on his face?
[50:38.130 --> 50:40.250]  I think the real guy has that tattoo.
[50:40.450 --> 50:42.370]  So you'd have to ask Mr. Kerwin Frost.
[50:42.370 --> 50:42.610]  It's a real guy?
[50:43.250 --> 50:44.950]  Yeah, Kerwin Frost is like a DJ.
[50:47.030 --> 50:48.170]  I don't care about that one.
[50:48.290 --> 50:48.990]  Whatever, it's fine.
[50:49.230 --> 50:50.190]  I got 10 more, whatever.
[50:50.970 --> 50:52.150]  Was that the fourth they pulled?
[50:56.190 --> 50:58.490]  Does my soundboard go on my audio track?
[50:59.030 --> 50:59.830]  I don't know.
[51:00.510 --> 51:02.530]  It's definitely going on the Craig track.
[51:05.890 --> 51:07.170]  Come on.
[51:07.690 --> 51:07.830]  Darla.
[51:08.950 --> 51:11.590]  I don't like...
[51:11.830 --> 51:13.630]  Why does he open it so...
[51:14.070 --> 51:15.410]  He's so bad at this.
[51:16.670 --> 51:17.930]  God damn it.
[51:18.070 --> 51:18.730]  Uptown again.
[51:19.430 --> 51:20.890]  That's my fourth Uptown Mo.
[51:24.150 --> 51:25.750]  What does Darla look like?
[51:27.530 --> 51:28.170]  Darla...
[51:28.170 --> 51:30.230]  She's got some yellow earmuffs on.
[51:30.890 --> 51:31.370]  Yellow muffs.
[51:31.790 --> 51:33.430]  Well, yeah.
[51:33.950 --> 51:40.690]  Come on.
[51:45.310 --> 51:46.190]  No!
[51:46.950 --> 51:48.230]  Number five.
[51:50.010 --> 51:52.630]  How many of these...
[51:52.630 --> 51:54.190]  Are there four?
[51:54.990 --> 51:55.990]  He's asking if you're mad.
[51:56.770 --> 51:58.330]  Of course I'm mad.
[51:58.570 --> 51:59.830]  Of course I'm mad.
[52:05.230 --> 52:07.510]  I've been waiting an hour to be disappointed by this.
[52:07.710 --> 52:08.630]  But I'm happy with Kerwin.
[52:10.050 --> 52:10.930]  Jesus Christ.
[52:10.930 --> 52:12.030]  How many of those do you need?
[52:12.850 --> 52:14.250]  I don't need any of those.
[52:14.390 --> 52:16.970]  Was that six?
[52:26.710 --> 52:29.730]  I appreciate Emily changing the vibes with the different sound effects.
[52:30.730 --> 52:35.010]  I feel like I need to convince them to get everything off the table and onto stuff behind them.
[52:35.510 --> 52:36.570]  Oh my god, again!
[52:37.230 --> 52:38.750]  Hey, Gavin, do you want a Kerwin Frost?
[52:39.350 --> 52:40.210]  I'd love one.
[52:40.650 --> 52:41.830]  I love Kerwin Flambe.
[52:46.970 --> 52:47.990]  Alright, who do we have here?
[52:48.230 --> 52:50.150]  It's definitely not Darla.
[52:52.870 --> 52:55.210]  Andrew, do you have a Darla?
[52:55.210 --> 52:55.770]  What is it going to be?
[52:56.850 --> 52:58.150]  He is doing...
[52:58.150 --> 52:59.650]  Oh my god.
[52:59.670 --> 53:01.430]  All the suspense is off camera.
[53:04.930 --> 53:06.010]  Was that all of them?
[53:06.690 --> 53:07.970]  No, there's no...
[53:07.970 --> 53:10.310]  How many are left?
[53:11.890 --> 53:12.690]  Six left?
[53:13.230 --> 53:13.750]  Oh.
[53:14.710 --> 53:15.230]  Oh.
[53:16.090 --> 53:16.710]  There have been ten?
[53:17.710 --> 53:18.230]  Nine?
[53:18.490 --> 53:19.990]  Well, I got Kerwin Frost.
[53:20.530 --> 53:22.170]  He said multiple numbers.
[53:22.590 --> 53:23.610]  I thought it was 15.
[53:24.090 --> 53:26.150]  He said 15 at the start, but who knows.
[53:26.210 --> 53:27.130]  I thought I sent like 20.
[53:30.140 --> 53:31.000]  What's the next one?
[53:31.300 --> 53:32.600]  Oh no!
[53:33.480 --> 53:35.520]  I don't like that shot of all the duplicates.
[53:36.980 --> 53:38.280]  Come on, Darla!
[53:40.580 --> 53:42.640]  Fucking bald-headed ass Moe.
[53:44.320 --> 53:45.820]  So many Moes.
[53:45.820 --> 53:46.720]  This piece of shit.
[53:47.040 --> 53:48.720]  Moe was my favorite until now.
[53:49.600 --> 53:51.020]  I swear to god.
[53:51.400 --> 53:51.960]  No more Moe.
[53:52.460 --> 53:59.860]  I ate 170 nuggets
[53:59.860 --> 54:01.740]  for fucking 16 Moes.
[54:02.400 --> 54:03.480]  When did they get
[54:03.480 --> 54:04.020]  same-y?
[54:05.640 --> 54:06.880]  Cold nuggets?
[54:07.480 --> 54:09.140]  The fourth consecutive day of cold...
[54:09.140 --> 54:10.300]  God damn it!
[54:12.160 --> 54:12.760]  Fuck!
[54:13.520 --> 54:13.880]  Okay.
[54:15.220 --> 54:15.520]  How many?
[54:15.820 --> 54:17.780]  No, I don't. Emily.
[54:18.680 --> 54:19.080]  Emily!
[54:23.860 --> 54:25.060]  I respect
[54:25.060 --> 54:26.580]  her wanting the gold one so they can
[54:26.580 --> 54:27.240]  just take it.
[54:30.400 --> 54:31.540]  Come on, Darla!
[54:32.520 --> 54:34.780]  You yellow-muffed son of a bitch.
[54:35.200 --> 54:35.620]  Come on!
[54:38.060 --> 54:39.120]  Who the hell's that?
[54:40.280 --> 54:41.620]  I don't even know her name.
[54:42.040 --> 54:43.280]  Glazed donut head?
[54:45.080 --> 54:45.560]  Bernice?
[54:47.880 --> 54:49.200]  I don't know.
[54:49.800 --> 54:51.380]  I feel like you do. It wasn't.
[54:51.660 --> 54:53.400]  I think he knew. I think he's playing it up.
[54:53.600 --> 54:55.200]  He's being an ass. God damn him.
[55:00.460 --> 55:02.300]  We have three left?
[55:05.620 --> 55:07.560]  It's not over yet, Andrew. It's not over yet.
[55:07.680 --> 55:09.280]  Okay, we got three.
[55:12.440 --> 55:12.940]  No!
[55:16.080 --> 55:17.600]  It looked so promising!
[55:18.040 --> 55:19.480]  You got your nugget sauce.
[55:19.740 --> 55:20.800]  You got your BTS sauce.
[55:21.100 --> 55:21.980]  Oh my God.
[55:23.880 --> 55:24.880]  Uptown Moe. We gotta
[55:25.760 --> 55:27.260]  Uptown Moe has to become a star.
[55:30.540 --> 55:31.760]  It needs to be
[55:31.760 --> 55:33.500]  the next Tom Brady of McDonald's.
[55:35.640 --> 55:37.440]  Well, you got a lot of the ones you didn't have.
[55:41.400 --> 55:43.880]  I don't care
[55:43.880 --> 55:45.980]  if they get gold. Just give me
[55:45.980 --> 55:46.500]  Darla!
[55:47.540 --> 55:48.720]  I need a Darla!
[55:52.260 --> 55:52.500]  Okay.
[56:00.120 --> 56:01.080]  Fuck me!
[56:01.460 --> 56:02.860]  Jesus Christ!
[56:03.780 --> 56:05.180]  How many duplicates of
[56:05.180 --> 56:06.400]  Kerwin Frost do I have?
[56:06.520 --> 56:07.920]  You mailed him four Kershels.
[56:08.520 --> 56:10.240]  I only needed one!
[56:13.320 --> 56:14.940]  They're fry shoes. You can buy them.
[56:15.040 --> 56:16.360]  They're clogs. They're really stupid.
[56:17.440 --> 56:18.420]  I hate this.
[56:18.840 --> 56:20.280]  I fucking hate this.
[56:21.180 --> 56:21.640]  Fingers crossed.
[56:22.040 --> 56:24.140]  I got my fingers and my ass crossed for you.
[56:24.300 --> 56:26.880]  There's no way it's gonna be Darla, but this is it. Come on. I gotta believe.
[56:27.660 --> 56:29.180]  Miracles can happen. Good things can
[56:29.180 --> 56:31.160]  happen. Oh, it's gonna be a Moe.
[56:31.160 --> 56:33.820]  Oh, it's my dra- No, but Gavin, this is my dragon year.
[56:33.900 --> 56:35.500]  This is my dragon year. This is your
[56:35.500 --> 56:37.260]  dragon year. Year of the dog?
[56:38.260 --> 56:39.120]  No, no.
[56:39.340 --> 56:41.680]  I'm surprised to see what's coming.
[56:41.840 --> 56:43.460]  Fucking dragons. Gavin.
[56:43.740 --> 56:45.000]  These fucking dragons.
[56:45.320 --> 56:47.480]  I'm sick of it. We're only
[56:47.480 --> 56:48.780]  in January, Gavin.
[56:49.340 --> 56:51.660]  I got eleven more months of this.
[56:51.920 --> 56:53.520]  Oh, god.
[56:55.880 --> 56:57.320]  Oh, my god.
[56:58.380 --> 56:59.460]  I spent so
[56:59.460 --> 57:01.060]  much money on Happy Meals.
[57:01.480 --> 57:03.640]  So, wait. So, was there another one that didn't
[57:03.640 --> 57:05.500]  come up once? How many are there? Six?
[57:06.140 --> 57:06.940]  There's- I-
[57:07.620 --> 57:09.340]  Gavin, there's six of them.
[57:10.300 --> 57:11.680]  How'd you get so many
[57:11.680 --> 57:13.720]  of the same one? I don't know.
[57:16.840 --> 57:18.820]  I don't know. Fucking dragon years.
[57:18.960 --> 57:21.200]  That's how. That's how this happened. The fucking dragons.
[57:21.600 --> 57:22.800]  I'm protesting dragons.
[57:23.100 --> 57:25.180]  You're the exception. Every other
[57:25.180 --> 57:27.120]  dragon is getting- is gone.
[57:27.440 --> 57:28.600]  Noah magic dragons.
[57:28.600 --> 57:30.420]  I might watch Reign of Fire
[57:30.420 --> 57:32.660]  just to see some dragon death.
[57:35.240 --> 57:36.940]  Oh, my god.
[57:42.060 --> 57:42.680]  Yeah, that's
[57:42.680 --> 57:44.220]  let's be honest.
[57:46.160 --> 57:46.880]  Yeah, because
[57:46.880 --> 57:48.720]  I'm recording an hour of this,
[57:49.000 --> 57:49.160]  Eric.
[57:50.480 --> 57:52.960]  No, I'm not. I would love to be
[57:52.960 --> 57:54.100]  having quiet time in the bath.
[57:56.640 --> 57:57.020]  Does it
[57:57.020 --> 57:59.080]  make sense that I'm responding to the video?
[57:59.260 --> 58:01.420]  I just realized. I'm just so annoyed.
[58:01.840 --> 58:03.480]  Oh, my god. I can't believe-
[58:03.480 --> 58:05.220]  Can I- I need to check if I can order
[58:05.220 --> 58:06.240]  Happy Meals right now.
[58:08.420 --> 58:09.280]  I'm sure you could.
[58:09.960 --> 58:10.540]  Let's see.
[58:10.920 --> 58:13.260]  Because most of them are sold out. Last time I checked,
[58:13.320 --> 58:13.760]  they couldn't.
[58:15.060 --> 58:16.960]  I'm gonna be so goddamn mad.
[58:24.540 --> 58:26.160]  I kinda want a Happy Meal now.
[58:28.920 --> 58:29.240]  Yeah!
[58:32.880 --> 58:33.320]  Let's see.
[58:37.400 --> 58:38.700]  Oh, fuck. I hate when
[58:38.700 --> 58:40.900]  I don't have my phone with me and it just- I tried to
[58:40.900 --> 58:42.140]  log in and it said verify.
[58:43.000 --> 58:44.700]  Oh, wait. Is it just bypassing its own?
[58:45.360 --> 58:46.900]  Yeah, it did. That's fucking awesome.
[58:47.580 --> 58:49.060]  It just tried to two-factor me
[58:49.060 --> 58:50.380]  and said, ah, don't worry about it.
[58:51.280 --> 58:52.580]  Just the one factor today.
[58:53.660 --> 58:54.820]  One factor for you.
[58:54.880 --> 58:56.760]  We know the pain you're going through. Let's see the closest
[58:57.320 --> 58:57.760]  McDonald's.
[58:58.120 --> 58:59.920]  Well, you got to them.
[59:04.290 --> 59:06.850]  We got a Hot Honey McCrispy
[59:06.850 --> 59:07.570]  going on right now.
[59:08.910 --> 59:09.870]  Which is pretty good.
[59:10.150 --> 59:11.810]  I don't know if you have that available to you.
[59:12.390 --> 59:13.410]  But I would recommend it.
[59:14.070 --> 59:16.850]  Well, I can't order anything from McDonald's that isn't a Big Mac.
[59:18.690 --> 59:19.110]  Oh!
[59:21.370 --> 59:22.870]  They still have them.
[59:22.950 --> 59:23.590]  Should I order one?
[59:24.050 --> 59:26.250]  Uh, yes.
[59:27.030 --> 59:28.530]  I'm going to order one more.
[59:28.710 --> 59:29.630]  They're $17.
[59:30.690 --> 59:31.030]  Why?
[59:31.650 --> 59:34.290]  Because they're adult Happy Meals and the toy.
[59:40.990 --> 59:42.710]  Oh, that's not a good sign.
[59:43.590 --> 59:44.670]  Oh, wait. Never mind.
[59:44.750 --> 59:45.790]  It's fine. I want the nuggets.
[59:46.650 --> 59:48.390]  Well, I'm going to order one more of these.
[59:49.990 --> 59:50.670]  We could wrap
[59:50.670 --> 59:52.010]  this up. I don't care about baseball.
[59:52.010 --> 59:52.870]  Do you care about baseball?
[59:53.530 --> 59:54.930]  I don't even know the rules.
[59:55.290 --> 59:57.370]  Yeah, maybe we should play baseball.
[59:57.790 --> 59:58.910]  Didn't you almost win
[59:58.910 --> 01:00:00.350]  face-off in baseball?
[01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.810]  Where did you place?
[01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:04.370]  Watching baseball isn't really anything I did.
[01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:06.270]  Or contributed to.
[01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:07.950]  That's fair.
[01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:10.930]  What you did contribute to, though, is this recording.
[01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:13.250]  My misery. Thank you for joining me, Gavin.
[01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:14.210]  Thanks for having me.
[01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:15.890]  This was weird.
[01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:18.830]  I'm excited to maybe do something
[01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:19.710]  like this again.
[01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:21.910]  I'm going to finish my outro
[01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.950]  before Eric does. Fuck you, Eric.
[01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:25.770]  I say that lovingly. Bye!
[01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:27.930]  Look at his schmuck little head.
[01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:30.310]  He looks so small
[01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:30.850]  with that helmet.
