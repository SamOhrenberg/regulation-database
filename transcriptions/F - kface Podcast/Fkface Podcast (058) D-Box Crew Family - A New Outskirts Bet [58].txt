[00:34.890 --> 00:39.990]  Hello, and welcome to episode 58, I think. Is this 58?
[00:40.290 --> 00:40.510]  Yeah.
[00:40.510 --> 00:46.130]  Yeah, 58, a f***ing face. What's everyone's favorite brand of honey mustard? I'll go first.
[00:46.470 --> 00:51.430]  I really enjoy White Spots. I know they're a restaurant chain and not a brand. They have
[00:51.430 --> 00:54.010]  a fantastic honey mustard. Geoff, what is your favorite?
[00:54.290 --> 00:56.570]  I'll be honest with you, Andrew, I don't like it.
[00:56.890 --> 00:57.310]  Wow.
[00:57.830 --> 01:03.070]  I don't think I've ever bought it from a brand in a store. If I'm picking a sauce in a restaurant
[01:03.070 --> 01:06.690]  maybe I'll have it, but I don't ever buy the whole thing.
[01:06.690 --> 01:12.810]  It's weird to me, dude. I like honey and I like mustard, but together, it's not a draw
[01:12.810 --> 01:19.810]  for me. I respect that you love it so much. I really do. I do. Oh, and Nick has an answer.
[01:19.970 --> 01:21.810]  He's got it locked and loaded.
[01:22.390 --> 01:25.570]  I don't know why I didn't immediately go to Nick for this.
[01:25.630 --> 01:27.490]  Texas Honey Ham Company.
[01:27.670 --> 01:29.810]  Can I get Texas Honey Ham Company?
[01:30.050 --> 01:30.990]  Seems pretty local.
[01:31.830 --> 01:35.170]  Let's see if I can order that. I mean, I got salad cream.
[01:35.170 --> 01:36.850]  Do you know what I realized, by the way?
[01:37.190 --> 01:37.490]  What's that?
[01:37.510 --> 01:38.050]  What did you realize?
[01:38.510 --> 01:45.190]  We went around everyone and did the Soda Chug Burp Challenge, but I couldn't help but notice
[01:45.190 --> 01:50.570]  that someone was absent when we did that.
[01:50.910 --> 01:52.050]  That's an excellent point.
[01:52.390 --> 01:59.130]  So we're going to need to sort of round off this whole chapter of F*** Face today, probably.
[01:59.570 --> 02:01.690]  I'm probably... I'm going to have to agree with you.
[02:02.750 --> 02:03.530]  Eric, thoughts?
[02:04.030 --> 02:07.070]  Yeah, so how is Nick going to do this?
[02:07.590 --> 02:08.350]  Nick already did it.
[02:08.530 --> 02:10.230]  Nick did it. Nick was part of the chug.
[02:10.390 --> 02:14.990]  Okay, so then, follow up question. Can I fake it like Geoff, or do I actually have to?
[02:14.990 --> 02:16.270]  I didn't fake it!
[02:16.770 --> 02:20.750]  I told you it was going to be a letdown if I did it, because I've already proved that I can do it easily.
[02:21.090 --> 02:22.310]  Why do people think you have faked it?
[02:22.550 --> 02:23.250]  I don't understand that.
[02:23.450 --> 02:29.910]  Because there is... Okay, so Geoff's like, I'm going to chug it, and he says, I'm going to try to do this so you can hear it.
[02:29.910 --> 02:36.070]  You hear nothing, and then a few seconds later, he's like, halfway through, and then there's like a second of nothing, and then, done!
[02:36.270 --> 02:38.750]  Well, I assume Nick's just cutting out silence.
[02:39.170 --> 02:42.610]  Could be, but I felt like even live, it was pretty...
[02:42.610 --> 02:43.110]  Yeah, see, Nick says true.
[02:43.690 --> 02:49.270]  That's because I don't make a lot of noise. I don't sound like a dying dinosaur when I drink like you do. I'm sorry.
[02:51.490 --> 02:54.470]  Oh, Nick couldn't hear the chugging in the raw audio.
[02:54.510 --> 02:55.750]  Hold up! I'm getting...
[02:55.750 --> 02:58.590]  I'm getting... Oh, Nick, I'll be right back.
[02:58.590 --> 03:03.530]  Nick, if you can hear Jack in the audio when we couldn't hear Jack, that is damning evidence.
[03:03.550 --> 03:08.350]  Because I was going to say, the fact that we couldn't hear Jack made me think that Geoff did do it, and we just couldn't hear it.
[03:08.410 --> 03:12.890]  If you can hear Jack in the audio, that to me indicates that Geoff didn't do the chug.
[03:13.030 --> 03:17.650]  I believe that Geoff fully did it, but I'm willing to continue on the path that he didn't, just so he has to do it again.
[03:17.830 --> 03:20.290]  It sounds like he's going to try it again. He definitely did it last week.
[03:20.770 --> 03:24.630]  I'm not sure about that. The lack of audio is fascinating.
[03:26.330 --> 03:33.590]  I was going to say, Andrew, how much you were just getting... You were enjoying it so much as we struggled to even chug it.
[03:33.750 --> 03:34.970]  It was just like...
[03:34.970 --> 03:41.250]  Well, because you guys talked so much shit about how easy it was, and then it was a nightmare for everybody involved.
[03:41.450 --> 03:44.250]  Okay, listen. I'm going to do it again, okay?
[03:45.130 --> 03:47.590]  Here, listen to the fucking... It's Coke Zero.
[03:48.470 --> 03:50.810]  Listen for this. Can you hear that? I'm going to open it.
[03:51.670 --> 03:52.390]  Did you hear that?
[03:52.810 --> 03:53.370]  It sounded real.
[03:53.770 --> 03:54.670]  Definitely opened it.
[03:54.670 --> 03:55.670]  Splattered me in the fucking face.
[03:56.070 --> 04:01.790]  Alright, so now I'm just going to drink it. I'm going to stop at some point to breathe, but I won't...
[04:01.790 --> 04:02.610]  Sounds like a sound effect.
[04:02.610 --> 04:08.990]  Why don't you produce an audible hum, so we'll know where you are in the stage of drinking and breathing.
[04:09.050 --> 04:09.850]  I'll try to.
[04:10.910 --> 04:11.810]  Turn on my camera.
[04:12.130 --> 04:12.950]  Suck my butt.
[04:13.190 --> 04:13.650]  Alright, here we go.
[04:14.230 --> 04:15.410]  Here, I'll take a fucking photo.
[04:15.670 --> 04:16.310]  I'll take a fucking photo.
[04:17.170 --> 04:19.230]  I mean, that doesn't prove anything. We know you have a soda.
[04:19.570 --> 04:22.050]  This photo's useless. I don't...
[04:22.050 --> 04:23.490]  Alright, here we go. I'm going to record this.
[04:23.650 --> 04:24.830]  Alright, here we go. I'm going to record it.
[04:24.990 --> 04:25.490]  Alright, here we go.
[04:26.250 --> 04:27.290]  It's, uh, here we go.
[04:27.650 --> 04:28.390]  I'm going to record.
[04:28.850 --> 04:30.970]  I'm actually recording. It's not like an Action Bronson type thing.
[04:33.030 --> 04:33.750]  Uh, and...
[04:36.250 --> 04:39.110]  I mean, it already sounds worse than it did last time.
[04:39.950 --> 04:41.490]  Oh, I can hear it. I can hear that.
[04:41.630 --> 04:42.410]  Yeah, I heard the chug that time.
[04:42.670 --> 04:44.170]  He's really making it count there.
[04:45.110 --> 04:45.790]  Silence again.
[04:46.590 --> 04:47.570]  Alright, it's gone.
[04:48.230 --> 04:49.310]  That was really fast.
[04:49.750 --> 04:50.630]  Yeah, I just did it.
[04:50.630 --> 04:52.270]  That was... that was really quick.
[04:52.830 --> 04:53.270]  Urgh!
[04:54.010 --> 04:55.490]  Ha ha ha ha!
[04:57.750 --> 04:58.190]  Urgh!
[04:58.810 --> 05:02.010]  Oh no! Nick just said, on a second listen, I can hear the chugging.
[05:02.310 --> 05:04.290]  You didn't have to do that, Geoff. You didn't have to do it.
[05:04.850 --> 05:05.290]  God.
[05:06.050 --> 05:12.290]  I need to credit Eric with the masterful performance of being asked to drink a soda and then having this happen.
[05:12.350 --> 05:14.770]  That was a great, great move by Eric. A great move.
[05:14.890 --> 05:15.550]  That was quite the move.
[05:15.970 --> 05:20.310]  But that only works if we just move on and refuse to go back to Eric.
[05:20.310 --> 05:20.890]  That's true.
[05:21.010 --> 05:21.990]  But we don't do that.
[05:22.090 --> 05:23.950]  No, Eric, you're up.
[05:24.350 --> 05:26.210]  I don't think I keep soda in the house.
[05:26.450 --> 05:29.310]  You? What do you mean? You're an American!
[05:30.230 --> 05:32.110]  I don't really drink soda.
[05:32.370 --> 05:36.350]  I can try to... what if I crush a Budweiser? Is that American?
[05:36.790 --> 05:37.910]  That's very American.
[05:38.170 --> 05:43.410]  Alright, talk about something else and I'll try to... I'll go get a Budweiser real quick.
[05:43.910 --> 05:45.250]  Alright, hang on. We'll be right back.
[05:46.050 --> 05:46.350]  Urgh!
[05:47.070 --> 05:47.470]  Urgh!
[05:49.050 --> 05:53.250]  Nick's right. Nick's right. You could favorite or instacart it and it'd be there in no time at all.
[05:53.290 --> 05:55.650]  Definitely before the end of the show. We can even vamp it along.
[05:56.590 --> 05:58.590]  Yeah, I can have my neighbor deliver some.
[06:00.850 --> 06:03.790]  This has got to go 50 houses or however the distance.
[06:04.550 --> 06:07.190]  God, I'm trying to share this stupid video and it won't share.
[06:07.490 --> 06:08.290]  On the Discord thing?
[06:08.590 --> 06:08.950]  Yeah.
[06:09.770 --> 06:13.310]  Well, maybe we should save the Eric chug for the finale.
[06:13.310 --> 06:15.990]  Go out on a set of tradition.
[06:16.770 --> 06:18.610]  Nick said it might be sparkling water and not a soda.
[06:19.310 --> 06:22.690]  I don't know what that means. I understand what those words mean.
[06:23.310 --> 06:24.850]  I think as long as it's carbonated.
[06:25.290 --> 06:28.350]  I think a sparkling water is fizzier than a soda.
[06:28.770 --> 06:29.890]  You do or you don't?
[06:29.910 --> 06:32.810]  I do. I would rather chug a soda than a sparkling water.
[06:32.930 --> 06:35.250]  I think if I did a sparkling water it'd be even worse than what happened.
[06:35.910 --> 06:38.110]  That's what I was doing. I don't drink soda.
[06:38.110 --> 06:40.150]  Wait, this just dawned on me.
[06:40.550 --> 06:42.990]  Wasn't the thing you're supposed to drink and then not burp?
[06:43.370 --> 06:46.270]  Yeah, it was a sparkling soda. We've been wrong the entire time with soda.
[06:46.450 --> 06:47.730]  It's been completely off.
[06:47.990 --> 06:49.790]  But didn't Geoff just drink it and then burp immediately?
[06:50.470 --> 06:51.850]  Yeah, no, he lost immediately.
[06:52.090 --> 06:54.810]  You gotta go 30 seconds. The timer starts at the end.
[06:54.850 --> 06:57.190]  Yeah, I lost. I just drank it.
[06:57.370 --> 07:01.030]  Oh, I didn't know. I wasn't aware that that was an option.
[07:01.390 --> 07:05.590]  No, if we're doing this right, you need to chug two cans and then not burp for 30 seconds.
[07:05.870 --> 07:07.750]  Oh, that's insane. What an insane thing.
[07:07.750 --> 07:08.890]  No, I'm not doing that.
[07:08.930 --> 07:10.490]  It's totally doable.
[07:10.850 --> 07:12.050]  I just don't have two cans left.
[07:12.270 --> 07:17.030]  That's interesting. Everybody yelled at me when I said I didn't have soda.
[07:17.210 --> 07:18.890]  But Geoff's going, I don't have two cans left.
[07:18.910 --> 07:21.250]  I just drank one on camera.
[07:21.690 --> 07:24.530]  Well, hang on. You could Instacart it real quick.
[07:24.850 --> 07:26.430]  Be here by the end of the show.
[07:26.430 --> 07:29.430]  But I don't need to because I've already done it.
[07:30.010 --> 07:30.870]  Twice now.
[07:31.150 --> 07:31.770]  You didn't won.
[07:32.570 --> 07:35.170]  Eric, just do your bud. Crush your bud, Eric.
[07:35.310 --> 07:35.490]  Oh, yeah.
[07:35.890 --> 07:36.650]  Oh, is he doing Cam?
[07:36.650 --> 07:38.590]  Yeah, I'll turn on a little camera for you.
[07:38.750 --> 07:39.250]  Oh, OK.
[07:39.670 --> 07:40.250]  Here we go.
[07:41.050 --> 07:42.690]  It's Budweiser King of Beers.
[07:43.510 --> 07:45.490]  This is the America can.
[07:45.850 --> 07:50.610]  I also don't think I can do this.
[07:50.690 --> 07:52.350]  Like, I guess I'll try.
[07:52.450 --> 07:54.910]  Yeah, like, what is a chug?
[07:55.010 --> 07:58.290]  I feel like you can't remove the can from your lips, but you can pause.
[07:58.790 --> 07:59.190]  All right.
[07:59.730 --> 08:00.650]  Haven't done this since college.
[08:00.750 --> 08:01.330]  Cheers to you.
[08:02.070 --> 08:03.690]  Look at him bragging about going to college.
[08:05.430 --> 08:06.490]  Andrew, did you go to college?
[08:06.710 --> 08:07.450]  Look at the glug rate.
[08:07.630 --> 08:08.110]  He's glugging.
[08:08.290 --> 08:09.210]  No, I did not go to college.
[08:09.370 --> 08:10.290]  Gavin, did you go to college?
[08:10.730 --> 08:10.970]  No.
[08:11.210 --> 08:12.010]  Well, I went to sixth form.
[08:12.530 --> 08:13.010]  Me either.
[08:13.530 --> 08:14.590]  I didn't even go to sixth form.
[08:15.310 --> 08:15.710]  All right.
[08:15.730 --> 08:16.270]  It's down.
[08:17.170 --> 08:17.730]  30 seconds.
[08:18.150 --> 08:18.830]  It's not Bud yet.
[08:19.350 --> 08:19.810]  He looks in pain.
[08:19.810 --> 08:20.370]  Get near the mic, Eric.
[08:20.590 --> 08:21.470]  Get near the mic.
[08:21.550 --> 08:22.550]  We need to hear the suffering.
[08:23.590 --> 08:24.830]  He does not look good.
[08:25.230 --> 08:26.210]  He's shaking his hands around.
[08:26.210 --> 08:26.810]  He's shaking it out.
[08:27.750 --> 08:28.790]  I think he's, like, trying to...
[08:28.810 --> 08:29.630]  Geoff might be right.
[08:29.970 --> 08:30.850]  Yeah, you lose the bud.
[08:31.670 --> 08:32.210]  Oh, no.
[08:32.210 --> 08:33.370]  I lost it.
[08:33.430 --> 08:36.290]  I felt it, and it went back down, and now my stomach's even worse.
[08:37.870 --> 08:39.170]  I don't know that I can burp.
[08:39.950 --> 08:40.710]  Oh, okay.
[08:40.910 --> 08:41.150]  There you go.
[08:41.470 --> 08:42.130]  You got it.
[08:42.210 --> 08:42.510]  Okay.
[08:46.230 --> 08:47.630]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[08:49.850 --> 08:56.170]  This is the first time I think I've chugged a Budweiser without popping it with a key and then slamming it in the front yard.
[08:58.430 --> 08:59.810]  When was the last time you did that?
[08:59.810 --> 09:02.630]  Uh, 2008.
[09:05.350 --> 09:10.010]  Oh, by the way, did I tell you, Eric, I have a heart out after the break shit?
[09:10.510 --> 09:12.710]  Oh, I think we both have the same heart out.
[09:12.990 --> 09:15.510]  I was gonna ask if it's your heart out as well.
[09:15.570 --> 09:17.570]  Oh, we have the exact same heart out.
[09:18.510 --> 09:19.750]  What's your heart out?
[09:20.110 --> 09:28.960]  We have a group that sees movies that had to take a break for a while, but now we're back in full force.
[09:30.090 --> 09:33.170]  And it's an insane group of people.
[09:33.810 --> 09:35.770]  So we went and saw Hobbs & Shaw.
[09:36.250 --> 09:43.850]  I got asked by Tim G, TPG from sales, and he went, bro, you fuck with Hobbs & Shaw?
[09:44.170 --> 09:48.330]  And I said, I guess so.
[09:48.390 --> 09:50.610]  And he said, you fuck with D-Box?
[09:50.790 --> 09:52.370]  And I said, I don't know what that is.
[09:52.450 --> 09:55.150]  And he said, bro, D-Box, Hobbs & Shaw.
[09:55.310 --> 09:55.990]  And I said, okay.
[09:55.990 --> 09:57.790]  So I show up to a movie theater.
[09:58.550 --> 10:02.570]  Myself, Tim G, Meg, and Gavin.
[10:03.110 --> 10:04.010]  And that's the group.
[10:06.930 --> 10:14.430]  So Tim G hit me up earlier this week or last week, and he said, bro, I can't wait to fuck with Fast 9.
[10:14.590 --> 10:15.570]  And I said, let's do it.
[10:15.630 --> 10:17.830]  And he said, bro, D-Box.
[10:18.090 --> 10:19.270]  And I said, let's fucking do it.
[10:19.290 --> 10:21.490]  And he said, I'm getting the crew back together.
[10:21.910 --> 10:23.890]  The D-Box crew is back, baby!
[10:25.410 --> 10:27.010]  I'm so excited.
[10:27.570 --> 10:29.190]  It's the D-Box family.
[10:29.330 --> 10:30.630]  You guys are honoring the movie.
[10:30.750 --> 10:30.890]  It is straight up.
[10:31.170 --> 10:31.650]  Straight up.
[10:32.410 --> 10:43.670]  Like, right after we do break shit, we are like going and seeing fucking Fast & Furious 9 in D-Box.
[10:45.410 --> 10:46.930]  With Tim G.
[10:47.130 --> 10:47.950]  I don't know, man.
[10:47.950 --> 10:48.990]  It's been a few years.
[10:49.210 --> 10:49.830]  It's been a few.
[10:50.870 --> 10:53.190]  I'm like legitimately excited.
[10:53.190 --> 10:54.610]  I'm so jealous.
[10:54.950 --> 10:56.390]  This is like a great experience.
[10:56.550 --> 10:57.970]  It sounds like an awesome time.
[10:58.170 --> 11:03.910]  I've actually seen every Fast movie in D-Box since I moved to this country in 2012.
[11:04.390 --> 11:10.170]  And the first time was probably the roughest because I think I'd eaten something a little bit gammy earlier in the day.
[11:10.410 --> 11:11.050]  Was that with Ben?
[11:11.650 --> 11:13.110]  No, I think it was with Michael and Lindsay.
[11:13.390 --> 11:16.230]  I saw Fast 5 in D-Box, I think, with Ben.
[11:16.650 --> 11:17.910]  Yeah, I think that was a little bit earlier.
[11:18.450 --> 11:18.670]  Oh.
[11:19.190 --> 11:20.350]  That was probably before I moved here.
[11:20.350 --> 11:25.630]  But I think I ate some gammy Trudy's or something or I had too many frozen margaritas or something.
[11:25.790 --> 11:31.030]  But I sat down and it did the little D-Box trailer where it's like, ah, this is what these seats do.
[11:31.110 --> 11:32.610]  And they like shook the shit out of me.
[11:32.650 --> 11:33.370]  I was like...
[11:33.370 --> 11:37.050]  And then I was just like, I have to go and throw up before this movie starts.
[11:38.890 --> 11:41.090]  Because I was about to hurl in my seat.
[11:41.250 --> 11:43.730]  I ran right before the movie started.
[11:43.830 --> 11:44.970]  I ran, threw up and came back.
[11:45.070 --> 11:45.850]  And it was awesome.
[11:46.370 --> 11:46.890]  It was great.
[11:47.330 --> 11:50.210]  Before we get too far away, I have some questions I need to ask.
[11:50.210 --> 11:52.430]  Gavin, did you receive the same pitch?
[11:52.630 --> 11:55.630]  Did Tim Chee come to you and say, do you fuck with Hobbs and Shaw?
[11:55.890 --> 11:56.890]  Was it the same intro?
[11:57.250 --> 11:59.170]  How did you get recruited into the family?
[11:59.490 --> 12:05.070]  Well, I want to say that because I was already... I'd already had my perfect record of fast movies and D-Box.
[12:05.270 --> 12:09.090]  I think he was trying to seed Hobbs and Shaw and I recommended D-Box.
[12:09.590 --> 12:12.630]  And then he passed that on to Eric and now it's just become the crew.
[12:13.030 --> 12:14.070]  But how did...
[12:14.070 --> 12:17.110]  Okay, I guess I don't see how he becomes involved in it at that point.
[12:17.110 --> 12:20.370]  He seems like the Dom Toretto of this D-Box family.
[12:21.710 --> 12:24.050]  And you're making it sound like he was an addition.
[12:24.230 --> 12:26.670]  Like you're doing this regardless and you just happened to cross paths.
[12:26.670 --> 12:28.590]  But that's the thing. Here's the thing.
[12:28.930 --> 12:36.650]  Fast and Furious is a group of people who were already doing a lot of different things that have come together.
[12:37.170 --> 12:40.930]  And now they are secret agents.
[12:42.190 --> 12:44.970]  So that's kind of what we're doing. We're all doing different stuff.
[12:44.970 --> 12:47.750]  I'm kind of like the ludicrous of this whole thing.
[12:48.230 --> 12:55.010]  Definitely like been around, but also you go, but really what's he doing here?
[12:55.350 --> 12:57.310]  So I feel good in my role.
[12:57.710 --> 13:00.610]  Was it TPG last time who took the poster?
[13:01.250 --> 13:02.690]  He got the free poster?
[13:03.230 --> 13:05.810]  Yeah. Oh, he was so excited about a free poster.
[13:06.150 --> 13:13.470]  I just like that. I like that this crew that's getting back together has never once hung out outside of a fast movie.
[13:13.470 --> 13:18.850]  It's all we do. We have literally never all been in the same place again.
[13:18.990 --> 13:24.550]  The only time we've hung out is the one time seeing that other movie.
[13:25.450 --> 13:30.850]  The COVID happened and Tim went, bro, you fuck with Fast 9?
[13:33.770 --> 13:35.130]  It's going to be so good.
[13:35.490 --> 13:41.270]  I'm excited. I'm so excited. We're going to open a bunch of cards and then we're going to go get shaking around.
[13:41.270 --> 13:45.070]  We're going to open cards. I'll quickly go make myself throw up and then we'll head out.
[13:47.210 --> 13:50.350]  I'm curious how many other people got invited to the Dbox family.
[13:50.630 --> 13:53.490]  This is a great thing. I hope it expands.
[13:53.710 --> 13:54.990]  Sounds like a pretty exclusive club.
[13:55.310 --> 13:58.770]  I can't wait for one of you to die and then come back two years later.
[13:59.010 --> 14:02.130]  I got invited to the Sunday overflow event with Alfredo.
[14:03.590 --> 14:05.570]  I'm going to that one too. So I'll see you there.
[14:07.050 --> 14:07.490]  Everyone.
[14:10.490 --> 14:16.070]  Because then we saw Alfredo at a bar and I bought Coronas and I just went, it's family.
[14:16.390 --> 14:17.770]  And then we felt really good about it.
[14:19.770 --> 14:24.350]  What? It's interesting. You called them agents. I don't know what I'd categorize the crew as.
[14:24.430 --> 14:27.970]  I feel like they're a bit, are they a family business technically? Like what?
[14:29.010 --> 14:31.330]  They've registered a company. They've got like an LLC.
[14:32.090 --> 14:34.990]  I don't, I think they're a family business technically.
[14:34.990 --> 14:39.910]  I think I was watching fast six, no fast seven on a plane.
[14:40.190 --> 14:44.230]  And there was one point where this girl like gave them information.
[14:44.790 --> 14:49.570]  And, uh, uh, they were like, Oh, the, our other team would have tortured you for that information.
[14:49.570 --> 14:52.270]  And she's like, I don't trust that team. I trust you.
[14:52.290 --> 14:56.610]  And I'm like, they've gotten so big. They have teams within their team.
[14:57.390 --> 14:59.610]  That's insane. That's crazy.
[14:59.710 --> 15:03.250]  We've witnessed the expansion. The first movie was about racing.
[15:03.910 --> 15:06.410]  It was about stealing VCRs.
[15:06.550 --> 15:10.750]  That was like the big heist in the first movie. We've come a long way.
[15:11.870 --> 15:13.530]  This is how governments work.
[15:14.610 --> 15:19.450]  Can you imagine how bummed people would be if fast nine was just a racing movie?
[15:22.070 --> 15:25.430]  It's like a weird G.I. Joe thing now. Like he's got a metal suit. I'm excited.
[15:25.710 --> 15:29.310]  I want to see fast nine now. You've, you've, you've excited me about these movies.
[15:29.370 --> 15:30.770]  I mean, they're great movies to begin with.
[15:30.770 --> 15:33.470]  You played any of the games for Fast and Furious?
[15:33.630 --> 15:37.690]  Uh, yeah. Geoff and I made a video, I think, in Fast Five.
[15:38.870 --> 15:45.550]  Oh, the one that didn't have, like, it's what is it like Tyrese and Ludacris and Paul Walker are like the playable characters?
[15:45.710 --> 15:48.270]  Like Vin Diesel, I don't think is in that game.
[15:48.510 --> 15:52.430]  I don't remember. I just remember it was trash. It was really not.
[15:52.470 --> 15:59.930]  It was really bad. The only good fast game was like the Forza tie-in and it's not even really like it's just the cars, but like the narrative.
[15:59.930 --> 16:04.670]  They put out a new one like a year ago that I haven't played that I own that I'm excited to.
[16:05.130 --> 16:11.050]  Speaking of G.I. Joe and how much enjoyment we got out of Sweden, uh, Rutabaga.
[16:11.170 --> 16:13.710]  Do you know what the English version of G.I. Joe is called?
[16:14.170 --> 16:18.850]  I feel like when you say it, I'll recognize it, but I could not pull it.
[16:18.910 --> 16:21.470]  Like I couldn't just say it right now, but I'll be like, yeah, that's correct.
[16:22.170 --> 16:22.970]  Action Man.
[16:23.650 --> 16:23.890]  Nuh-uh.
[16:23.910 --> 16:24.310]  That's great.
[16:25.890 --> 16:27.030]  I like Action Man.
[16:27.290 --> 16:28.150]  Nuh-uh.
[16:28.150 --> 16:30.070]  So wait, are they the Action Men?
[16:30.650 --> 16:31.650]  No, just Action Man.
[16:32.310 --> 16:35.130]  And I think it's like an action. It's like another action team, I guess.
[16:35.430 --> 16:40.010]  But it's G.I. Joe. It's like Scarlet and Hawk and Hawkeye.
[16:40.230 --> 16:43.830]  I don't know. I think it's just like a British spin-off and he has like real hair.
[16:44.390 --> 16:49.090]  Oh, it's a spin-off. It's not even a real. I thought you're saying that's what it was called.
[16:49.430 --> 16:53.010]  I thought it was like the cartoons. Like, like you have Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.
[16:53.370 --> 16:54.190]  Action Man.
[16:54.590 --> 16:55.350]  Action Man.
[16:55.610 --> 16:55.870]  Yeah.
[16:56.250 --> 16:57.730]  It's just like the dolls and stuff.
[16:58.010 --> 17:00.810]  I'm so confused about you. You somehow made this more confusing.
[17:01.170 --> 17:05.890]  Yeah. So what was, when you watched G.I. Joe, the cartoon in England, what was it called? Action Man, the cartoon?
[17:06.330 --> 17:08.390]  I didn't see G.I. Joe. I don't know.
[17:08.490 --> 17:08.790]  Great.
[17:09.310 --> 17:09.950]  I just had Action Man.
[17:10.730 --> 17:12.290]  This is like my...
[17:12.290 --> 17:13.930]  We're not G.I.s. I know what you want from me.
[17:15.990 --> 17:20.210]  Was it Leona Waddell, the basket weaver, where like they knew one thing about her?
[17:20.290 --> 17:24.790]  And this is yours, Matt. You know one thing and you have no other information about Action Man.
[17:24.790 --> 17:29.210]  I don't know. I look up Action Man. I'm pretty sure it's the same thing, kind of, mostly.
[17:29.650 --> 17:34.430]  Well, you're saying it's exactly the same thing. Those are two very different things if it's not the same thing.
[17:34.950 --> 17:39.050]  If it's not the same thing, you just told me that there's a thing in Europe called Action Man.
[17:39.210 --> 17:40.950]  There is a thing in Europe called Action Man.
[17:41.130 --> 17:45.650]  Yeah, but the whole point was that it was a fucking G.I. Joe thing and I don't think it is.
[17:45.790 --> 17:47.050]  I think it's just Action Man.
[17:47.550 --> 17:54.710]  I don't think it is. I looked up Action Man right now. It is a Canadian, it appears, TV series.
[17:54.710 --> 18:00.130]  Australian? I'm going into the wiki. 2000. Action Man TV series.
[18:00.370 --> 18:04.190]  I feel like I owned an action figure for the Action Man. Is his name Max?
[18:04.730 --> 18:08.550]  The show is unrelated to the 1995 show. Is that what you're referring to, Gavin?
[18:08.570 --> 18:17.770]  Action Man is an action figure launched in Britain in 1966 by blah blah blah as a licensed copy of Hasbro's American movable fighting man, G.I. Joe.
[18:18.210 --> 18:27.850]  So it's a variation. It's not... because it's licensed by, so it's I guess technically the same, but it's different. Or maybe they're just using the same pieces?
[18:28.910 --> 18:34.130]  I don't know. Look, now I'm worried that it's nothing to do with G.I. Joe, but it looks like it kind of is.
[18:34.610 --> 18:43.550]  Well, I feel like somebody called an Action Man would fit under the G.I. Joe umbrella as far as what that content would be. Action Man and G.I. Joe, the same.
[18:44.010 --> 18:53.670]  We had rescue heroes when I was growing up. Was our like G.I. Joe equivalent? But imagine, do you remember the PSAs in G.I. Joe of like, don't fucking leave the stove on?
[18:54.170 --> 18:58.390]  Yeah, I've only seen like the funny redubbed ones from the golden age of the internet.
[18:58.890 --> 19:09.630]  Rescue heroes was if they made G.I. Joe, but it was only the PSAs. It was just like, here's a group of like, kind of not really soldiers, but like firefighters and ambulance people and their superheroes.
[19:10.050 --> 19:21.870]  They're going to stop a fire or like there's a tsunami coming in. It was not. It's not really thrilling. Was that Canadian produced? It was. Yeah, I don't want to say it was a Canadian cartoon.
[19:22.350 --> 19:34.050]  Action Man is a licensed copy of Hasbro's. So I guess it's the same as it's the same as the G.I. Joe doll, but it's not in the G.I. Joe universe. That makes sense.
[19:34.670 --> 19:41.790]  I think they just took the doll and renamed it, but it's not actually G.I. Joe. Yeah, yeah, no, I think it's his own separate thing, from what I could tell.
[19:42.110 --> 19:49.630]  What does G.I. even stand for? General issue or government issue? Game informer? Or game informer, yeah.
[19:54.610 --> 20:01.810]  What is HelloFresh? I feel like if you don't already know the answer at this point, then you've been living under a rock and not a flavor rock.

A sensitive call from the doctor? You'll take it on speakerphone on the bus. That's what you're doing if you're not using something like ExpressVPN.
[21:47.850 --> 21:59.830]  Because ISPs, like Comcast or Verizon, they know every single website you visit. Because internet service providers, and I'm not going to name them, you know who they are, you pay for one of them, they know every single website you visit.
[22:00.150 --> 22:14.450]  ISPs can then sell this information to ad companies and tech giants who then use your data to target you with very cleverly disguised ads for, oh, I don't know, decorative spoons and ceramic thimbles maybe.
[22:14.450 --> 22:27.850]  So why use ExpressVPN? I'll tell you why. So that you can protect your secure data. ExpressVPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet so people can't peep on your online activity.
[22:27.970 --> 22:39.390]  That's what tunnels are for. They're for hiding stuff. Getting something from point A to point B without the prying eyes. Fire up the app, click one button, it's rated number one by CNET, Wired, and The Verge, probably some other people.
[22:39.390 --> 22:50.110]  It works on phones, laptops, even routers, so that everybody who shares your wifi can also be protected. I like ExpressVPN most because when I'm thimbling, as we call it, I like to do it in private.
[22:50.470 --> 23:02.130]  I don't want big thimble or big spoon spying on me. I like to keep my transactions in the ceramic and collectible market. I like to keep them to myself. It's my business. And only mine.
[23:02.130 --> 23:18.350]  Secure your online activity by visiting ExpressVPN.com slash face today. That's expressvpn.com slash face. It's kind of like a song. And you can get an extra three months free. Expressvpn.com slash face.
[23:20.110 --> 23:21.210]  Geoff, you're a chain guy.
[23:21.610 --> 23:22.110]  What's up?
[23:22.690 --> 23:24.390]  You're a chain guy, apparently.
[23:25.130 --> 23:27.210]  That's what I said when you told me you're a chain guy.
[23:27.370 --> 23:28.210]  What does that mean?
[23:28.410 --> 23:29.350]  I'm a chain guy now.
[23:29.810 --> 23:31.790]  I bought a chain, and I wear it, and I like it.
[23:32.210 --> 23:33.490]  And now I'm a chain guy.
[23:33.610 --> 23:34.710]  You're a necklace guy.
[23:35.070 --> 23:37.710]  Yeah, I bought a chain. I bought like a gold chain.
[23:38.250 --> 23:41.430]  And I've been wearing it to test it out and see if I like wearing a chain.
[23:41.670 --> 23:42.450]  And I do.
[23:42.630 --> 23:46.310]  And then I've discovered that I quite enjoy chains.
[23:46.410 --> 23:47.350]  So now I'm a chain guy.
[23:47.810 --> 23:48.230]  Oh.
[23:48.590 --> 23:51.570]  This chain is a Cuban link chain, and I quite enjoy it.
[23:51.850 --> 23:53.030]  I think I might get another chain.
[23:53.170 --> 23:54.410]  Can we see a picture of this chain?
[23:54.730 --> 23:56.150]  I'd love to see a photo of the chain.
[23:56.230 --> 23:58.430]  And I want to say that when Geoff said I'm a chain guy,
[23:58.590 --> 24:00.570]  I bought a chain and I'm now wearing it,
[24:00.610 --> 24:03.690]  I immediately went to like Rampage Jackson chain level.
[24:04.010 --> 24:05.690]  I didn't think Geoff meant like a necklace.
[24:05.990 --> 24:08.350]  I thought I'll drop it in the Discord.
[24:08.470 --> 24:12.530]  I thought Geoff was going full Rampage Jackson, and I was all about it.
[24:12.590 --> 24:15.610]  I was very excited to see you walking around.
[24:15.610 --> 24:18.290]  I thought it was going to be like blockchain or something.
[24:18.890 --> 24:19.170]  No.
[24:19.830 --> 24:20.370]  No, no, no, no.
[24:20.710 --> 24:22.910]  Andrew, I might be going in that direction.
[24:23.090 --> 24:25.370]  I mean, like, I might, you don't, nobody starts out as...
[24:26.010 --> 24:27.350]  It's the same thing.
[24:28.350 --> 24:29.710]  Those photos are identical.
[24:30.190 --> 24:30.650]  Yeah, right?
[24:31.150 --> 24:36.670]  That looks like...
[24:37.790 --> 24:38.870]  Who wore it better?
[24:39.150 --> 24:39.370]  Huh?
[24:39.690 --> 24:40.590]  Who wore it better?
[24:41.110 --> 24:42.530]  Looks like a chain from Tiffany.
[24:44.230 --> 24:45.130]  It's just a chain.
[24:45.830 --> 24:47.230]  It's like a guy's chain.
[24:47.350 --> 24:48.870]  And you don't got even anything on it.
[24:48.990 --> 24:50.750]  Are you not going to put like a pendant or something?
[24:51.290 --> 24:52.090]  Or like a gem?
[24:52.470 --> 24:53.570]  Like a charm?
[24:54.250 --> 24:55.290]  No, I got it.
[24:55.330 --> 24:56.050]  I got it on the internet.
[24:56.790 --> 24:59.610]  Or a lock, and Emily has the key.
[25:00.290 --> 25:03.070]  Or like a picture of Millie and me in a locket.
[25:03.350 --> 25:04.310]  No, no, just the chain.
[25:04.650 --> 25:05.290]  Just the chain.
[25:05.970 --> 25:07.230]  I might get a bigger one, though.
[25:07.530 --> 25:09.250]  You should absolutely get a bigger one.
[25:09.370 --> 25:10.310]  I'm happy for you.
[25:10.590 --> 25:12.330]  I don't know that I'll get one as large as Rampage's,
[25:12.330 --> 25:14.410]  but I would like to add...
[25:14.410 --> 25:15.970]  I would like to at some point get to a...
[25:15.970 --> 25:18.590]  I'd like to have enough chains where it's an issue at the airport.
[25:20.930 --> 25:22.310]  So do you wear this to bed?
[25:22.370 --> 25:23.250]  Do you sleep in this chain?
[25:23.550 --> 25:24.850]  Yeah, you just live in it.
[25:24.970 --> 25:27.170]  You don't take them off, because they're hard as fuck to take on and off.
[25:28.210 --> 25:30.050]  So it's just on me 24 hours a day.
[25:30.590 --> 25:32.630]  I've been wearing it for about a month now, and I'm digging it.
[25:34.690 --> 25:38.170]  Usually keep it tucked under the shirt, so it's subtle.
[25:38.370 --> 25:38.910]  You don't see it a lot.
[25:38.910 --> 25:42.170]  Gavin, for instance, we spent an entire soccer game together.
[25:42.270 --> 25:44.550]  You had no idea I was rocking a chain the entire time.
[25:44.570 --> 25:45.430]  You were wearing that then?
[25:46.110 --> 25:46.750]  Every second.
[25:46.830 --> 25:49.610]  There's no way. I gotta look at our selfie. There's no way.
[25:49.890 --> 25:51.530]  Look at the selfie. There'll be a chain around my neck.
[25:52.010 --> 25:53.730]  It's probably tucked in my shirt, but you'll still be able to see it.
[25:53.810 --> 25:56.490]  Oh, I guess I didn't take a picture with you. I just took one with Millie.
[26:00.130 --> 26:01.310]  Well, that makes sense.
[26:03.190 --> 26:05.190]  I'm happy that you're a chain guy, Geoff.
[26:05.190 --> 26:09.130]  But I gotta say, this is like the most disappointing version of that lead-in.
[26:09.610 --> 26:11.710]  I didn't mean to disappoint you.
[26:12.050 --> 26:15.290]  I'm not sure how else I should have presented it to you.
[26:15.770 --> 26:19.530]  I used language that Andrew specifically would understand.
[26:19.870 --> 26:21.370]  Andrew, the I'm a blank guy.
[26:21.790 --> 26:22.730]  So I said, I'm a chain guy.
[26:23.010 --> 26:25.210]  I was trying to speak to you in your vernacular.
[26:25.630 --> 26:26.870]  You do appear to be a chain guy.
[26:26.990 --> 26:31.210]  Oh, while I was looking for that picture, I found the picture I took of Jack at that football game, by the way.
[26:34.390 --> 26:35.950]  That is definitely Jack.
[26:37.490 --> 26:40.450]  Also, you have no idea how far away that actually was from us.
[26:40.510 --> 26:42.410]  That's really zoomed.
[26:43.390 --> 26:48.790]  We took a bunch of pictures and then we zoomed in for about 30 minutes trying to find Jack until we finally did.
[26:49.190 --> 26:53.130]  Since you are a chain guy, Geoff, can I suggest some chains to you?
[26:53.450 --> 26:56.170]  Maybe some things to add to your collection?
[26:56.510 --> 27:00.510]  OK, so I'm going to go first of all with the classic stylish.
[27:02.210 --> 27:03.090]  It's been around forever.
[27:03.230 --> 27:04.830]  Maybe a nice Squidward.
[27:05.730 --> 27:06.610]  Solid gold.
[27:06.850 --> 27:07.770]  That looks expensive.
[27:08.230 --> 27:09.910]  It's not. It's like $100.
[27:10.670 --> 27:11.770]  Oh, that's also Patrick.
[27:12.010 --> 27:14.390]  You're right. That's Patrick.
[27:14.530 --> 27:15.710]  I was wildly inaccurate.
[27:16.550 --> 27:18.290]  What about Rocket Power?
[27:18.370 --> 27:19.270]  Are you a fan of Rocket Power?
[27:19.550 --> 27:20.090]  Don't know that.
[27:20.450 --> 27:22.290]  Rocket Power, look at them on a skateboard.
[27:22.290 --> 27:23.310]  You like the skateboard?
[27:23.750 --> 27:26.330]  I'm not familiar with that brand.
[27:26.530 --> 27:27.230]  That's pretty cool though.
[27:27.990 --> 27:29.430]  Yeah, those are top two.
[27:29.530 --> 27:32.470]  The last one I have, not a necklace, but maybe you want to expand.
[27:32.610 --> 27:33.470]  Are you a ring guy?
[27:33.690 --> 27:35.070]  Not yet.
[27:35.790 --> 27:38.490]  Well, now you can be, because you're a big Achievement fan.
[27:39.170 --> 27:39.830]  Achievement Hunter.
[27:40.110 --> 27:41.850]  You gotta be stylish with Xbox.
[27:42.210 --> 27:44.470]  You gotta round it out.
[27:44.750 --> 27:47.870]  That seems more like an Eric than me, but I like it.
[27:49.670 --> 27:53.530]  If you would have posted you wearing that Patrick chain, I would have been all about it.
[27:53.550 --> 27:54.370]  I might do it.
[27:56.130 --> 27:57.190]  I'd support it.
[27:57.230 --> 27:58.230]  You gotta work your way up to it.
[27:58.310 --> 28:01.290]  I feel like a chain is something you work your way up to.
[28:01.410 --> 28:05.610]  You gotta build the kind of confidence and the kind of presence that allows one to have a chain.
[28:05.910 --> 28:10.510]  You don't just walk out of the store looking like Rampage Jackson.
[28:10.590 --> 28:12.630]  I don't understand the path to that though.
[28:12.730 --> 28:14.130]  Who did you see with a chain?
[28:14.410 --> 28:16.790]  And then you thought, yeah, that's me.
[28:16.790 --> 28:18.810]  You didn't just think, I'm gonna get a chain.
[28:19.010 --> 28:20.290]  I was thinking about Mr. T.
[28:20.550 --> 28:22.570]  Yeah, I was thinking about how cool Mr. T was.
[28:22.910 --> 28:23.190]  Really?
[28:23.410 --> 28:24.110]  When I was a kid.
[28:24.510 --> 28:29.450]  And then I was thinking about how I always wanted to be like Mr. T.
[28:29.870 --> 28:31.370]  And then I thought, well, Mr. T...
[28:31.370 --> 28:32.990]  And I was like, he wore a lot of jewelry.
[28:33.250 --> 28:34.410]  And I was like, why don't I wear jewelry?
[28:34.490 --> 28:37.190]  And then I looked and I have, you know, I've always worn a rubber band.
[28:37.550 --> 28:38.630]  And I have my fart bracelet.
[28:38.850 --> 28:41.390]  And then I thought, well, my wrists are pretty full.
[28:41.630 --> 28:42.730]  I can't get an ankle bracelet.
[28:42.850 --> 28:43.410]  That would be weird.
[28:43.410 --> 28:44.910]  Well, the only thing left is...
[28:44.910 --> 28:48.530]  The only other stick I have to put something around is my neck.
[28:48.910 --> 28:49.890]  So I said, fuck it.
[28:50.230 --> 28:51.430]  I'll be a little baby Mr. T.
[28:51.550 --> 28:53.950]  How are you going to incorporate snacks onto the necklace?
[28:54.250 --> 28:55.250]  That's, yes, exactly.
[28:55.310 --> 28:56.990]  That's another question, right?
[28:57.030 --> 29:02.430]  It's like, here I am designing edible jewelry, yet I don't wear jewelry.
[29:02.930 --> 29:10.730]  So I can only assume that over time I will glean some insights that will help.
[29:11.250 --> 29:12.510]  This is like gateway jewelry.
[29:13.050 --> 29:13.290]  Yeah.
[29:13.290 --> 29:13.970]  Yeah, right?
[29:14.150 --> 29:17.550]  You gotta live it to understand it to sell it.
[29:17.830 --> 29:20.650]  What do you have to do to become someone who wears two chains?
[29:21.330 --> 29:22.730]  What is the elevation to that?
[29:23.110 --> 29:25.310]  Because I assume your next chain will be swapped.
[29:25.590 --> 29:27.870]  If you're saying like building up the chain line.
[29:28.170 --> 29:28.510]  I don't know.
[29:28.510 --> 29:30.270]  How do you achieve two levels of chains?
[29:30.350 --> 29:31.510]  I honestly don't know.
[29:31.630 --> 29:32.890]  I'm just worried about you.
[29:33.190 --> 29:34.950]  The amount that you fall off your bike.
[29:35.090 --> 29:36.770]  I'm worried that that's going to get caught on something.
[29:36.970 --> 29:39.770]  And you're going to be just hanging from a bridge by your chain.
[29:40.550 --> 29:42.330]  Speaking of falling off my bike, though.
[29:42.330 --> 29:43.990]  I did not fall off my bike today.
[29:44.290 --> 29:45.090]  Thank God.
[29:45.630 --> 29:46.710]  That's it? That's your story?
[29:46.970 --> 29:50.570]  Well, I've been working on a new trick.
[29:51.450 --> 29:52.950]  And today was the day.
[29:54.730 --> 29:55.530]  And I didn't fall.
[29:56.110 --> 29:57.030]  I did my trick.
[29:57.710 --> 29:58.470]  What is the trick?
[29:58.790 --> 29:59.830]  Did you record it?
[29:59.930 --> 30:00.970]  Is there video of the trick?
[30:01.130 --> 30:02.130]  No, there's no video.
[30:03.390 --> 30:06.050]  When I ride my bike, I have my route that I go.
[30:06.430 --> 30:08.770]  And there are some spots that I like to do fun stuff.
[30:08.970 --> 30:09.390]  Yeah, the bike rides.
[30:09.390 --> 30:10.750]  I like to do some fun stuff.
[30:10.930 --> 30:13.950]  Like the area where I go up the side of the hill.
[30:14.970 --> 30:16.810]  Where I crashed in the snow.
[30:17.130 --> 30:18.030]  You still do that, huh?
[30:18.330 --> 30:19.010]  Oh yeah, I still do it.
[30:19.790 --> 30:20.810]  I'll be honest with you.
[30:21.410 --> 30:25.130]  It took me a while to feel okay doing it again.
[30:25.330 --> 30:27.050]  And then I did a baby's for a while.
[30:27.950 --> 30:29.550]  And now I'm back to doing it.
[30:29.610 --> 30:31.550]  Now I'm back to bombing it at full speed again.
[30:32.010 --> 30:33.230]  So there's this other area
[30:33.230 --> 30:34.610]  where you come out of a tunnel
[30:35.250 --> 30:35.970]  and immediately
[30:35.970 --> 30:37.990]  it takes a hard right up a hill.
[30:37.990 --> 30:40.070]  But on the left
[30:40.070 --> 30:41.850]  is like a wall, kind of like a
[30:41.850 --> 30:44.010]  leveled embankment, kind of like the one that I wreck on.
[30:44.430 --> 30:46.290]  But this one, it wraps away
[30:46.290 --> 30:48.170]  so it's like convex a little bit.
[30:48.270 --> 30:49.970]  And this wall
[30:49.970 --> 30:52.070]  frustrates me because it's
[30:52.070 --> 30:54.010]  very inviting to ride a bicycle up.
[30:54.450 --> 30:56.130]  But because of the way it's convex
[30:56.130 --> 30:57.870]  it's very easy
[30:57.870 --> 31:00.050]  to lose your
[31:00.050 --> 31:01.730]  rear tire and have it
[31:01.730 --> 31:03.390]  spin out from under you
[31:03.990 --> 31:05.250]  and cause you to wreck.
[31:05.250 --> 31:07.150]  And I would say that happens probably
[31:07.890 --> 31:09.530]  7 out of 10 times I try
[31:09.530 --> 31:11.090]  to navigate this thing.
[31:11.510 --> 31:12.750]  It's pretty common that
[31:12.750 --> 31:15.370]  my tire spins out. The problem is
[31:15.370 --> 31:17.310]  you come out of this tunnel
[31:17.310 --> 31:18.910]  and then you make an immediate right turn.
[31:19.050 --> 31:21.210]  If you go straight where the right turn is
[31:21.210 --> 31:23.350]  that's a bridge over a culvert
[31:23.350 --> 31:25.490]  like a drainage ditch that goes about 4 feet down.
[31:26.030 --> 31:27.210]  So if you
[31:27.650 --> 31:29.390]  come out of the tunnel and you hit this wall
[31:29.390 --> 31:31.510]  to the left and ride up it, it's impossible
[31:31.510 --> 31:33.310]  to turn around and come down fast enough
[31:33.310 --> 31:35.410]  to make the path
[31:35.410 --> 31:37.370]  you will either do one of two things
[31:37.370 --> 31:39.190]  you'll either fall right off of it and
[31:39.190 --> 31:41.190]  take the 4 foot plunge, which I've done
[31:41.190 --> 31:43.350]  that's not fun. You'll miss it
[31:43.350 --> 31:45.330]  go down the 4 foot, just miss it
[31:45.330 --> 31:47.110]  go down the area and then slam into
[31:47.110 --> 31:49.210]  the wall at about elbow
[31:50.150 --> 31:51.350]  length and that sucks.
[31:52.030 --> 31:52.990]  But I realized today
[31:52.990 --> 31:55.350]  that if you just keep riding a little bit, no I didn't realize
[31:55.350 --> 31:57.390]  I realized recently, I was able to do it today
[31:57.390 --> 31:59.550]  that if you keep going a little bit on that wall
[31:59.550 --> 32:01.490]  and then you just go down into the culvert
[32:02.150 --> 32:03.670]  you can, there's a
[32:03.670 --> 32:05.730]  lip on the other side that's pretty tall
[32:05.730 --> 32:07.510]  but if you hit it fast enough
[32:07.510 --> 32:09.570]  you can jump it and then
[32:09.570 --> 32:11.210]  land on the path and then keep going
[32:11.210 --> 32:13.450]  in theory, right? Now the
[32:13.450 --> 32:15.810]  problem with that is you gotta hit that thing at speed
[32:16.570 --> 32:17.510]  and you gotta build
[32:17.510 --> 32:19.330]  that speed up going higher up on this
[32:19.330 --> 32:21.510]  embankment and then swinging
[32:21.510 --> 32:23.430]  back around, bombing that
[32:23.430 --> 32:25.610]  and then you gotta hit it hard enough because at the top
[32:25.610 --> 32:26.950]  it's like a teeter totter
[32:27.430 --> 32:29.430]  and there's no, like it's a real sharp
[32:29.430 --> 32:31.330]  berm and you have to jump it
[32:31.330 --> 32:33.510]  in theory and then do like
[32:33.510 --> 32:35.290]  a bunny hop over it or the
[32:35.290 --> 32:37.290]  bottom of the bike will definitely drag
[32:37.290 --> 32:39.590]  and you will fall. I know that because
[32:39.590 --> 32:41.430]  I tried this at quarter speed like
[32:41.430 --> 32:43.410]  a week ago and that's where I
[32:43.410 --> 32:45.070]  wrecked. Then I tried it at half speed
[32:45.770 --> 32:47.530]  and that's where I wrecked. And then I
[32:47.530 --> 32:49.490]  tried it at half speed again and I wrecked in a different
[32:49.490 --> 32:51.330]  place and there. So
[32:52.230 --> 32:53.370]  I've done this a few times
[32:53.370 --> 32:55.030]  and I realized that the only way to do it successfully
[32:55.830 --> 32:57.410]  is to do it at speed
[32:57.410 --> 32:59.310]  and today I said fuck it
[32:59.310 --> 33:01.390]  I don't have to go out of town for a couple days
[33:01.390 --> 33:03.430]  so I can handle a bruise or
[33:03.430 --> 33:05.230]  a scab and so I
[33:05.230 --> 33:06.510]  just fucking hit it.
[33:07.390 --> 33:09.310]  I hit it full speed and I was like
[33:09.310 --> 33:11.370]  who knows what's gonna happen and I jumped
[33:11.370 --> 33:13.310]  the shit out of it. It was awesome
[33:13.310 --> 33:15.350]  it was like a movie. It was like Rad and
[33:15.350 --> 33:17.250]  Gleaming the Cube all at once. I fucking
[33:17.250 --> 33:19.410]  I was seven feet tall
[33:19.410 --> 33:21.290]  and I had a giant penis by the end of it
[33:21.290 --> 33:23.230]  it was amazing. I couldn't believe I did it.
[33:23.510 --> 33:25.290]  What if we cut a sick trailer for
[33:25.290 --> 33:27.350]  F*** Face. I'll bring the phantom and we'll
[33:27.350 --> 33:29.550]  film you do that. How much air
[33:29.550 --> 33:31.390]  is involved? Emily has been trying to
[33:31.390 --> 33:33.290]  get me to cut a trailer where I just spin out on my
[33:33.290 --> 33:35.330]  bike and go like F*** Face break shit
[33:35.330 --> 33:37.230]  and then I haven't gotten around to doing it
[33:37.230 --> 33:39.270]  but I think it's a great idea. I also
[33:39.270 --> 33:40.650]  think that you would look at it and go like
[33:40.650 --> 33:43.170]  that's not hard at all. But it's been hard for me
[33:43.170 --> 33:45.310]  hard for a 46 year old dude. Requires a
[33:45.310 --> 33:47.370]  lot of coordination. Requires a lot of sketchy shit
[33:47.370 --> 33:49.070]  I've already wrecked my bike like a
[33:49.070 --> 33:51.290]  hole. But what's hard if you're not actually
[33:51.290 --> 33:52.790]  like I assume you're not pedaling.
[33:52.790 --> 33:54.750]  Yeah, you gotta pedal to build up speed
[33:54.750 --> 33:56.850]  then you gotta ride up the side of
[33:56.850 --> 33:59.030]  this wall high enough then navigate
[33:59.030 --> 34:00.950]  down and like I said it's convex so the back
[34:00.950 --> 34:02.630]  tire really wants to swing out from under you
[34:02.630 --> 34:04.790]  which when that happens you're 8
[34:04.790 --> 34:06.810]  and a half feet in the air falling backwards
[34:06.810 --> 34:08.810]  down a concrete embankment with your bike
[34:08.810 --> 34:10.570]  going on top of you. Been there
[34:10.570 --> 34:12.870]  not great. It's
[34:12.870 --> 34:14.610]  a lot to put together especially
[34:14.610 --> 34:16.090]  at my advanced age. I'll be honest
[34:16.090 --> 34:18.710]  I listened to everything you said and I was listening to
[34:18.710 --> 34:20.850]  all the stuff about the culverts and the berms
[34:20.850 --> 34:22.850]  and stuff. If you asked me to draw a diagram
[34:22.850 --> 34:25.150]  of what you actually did I would have absolutely
[34:25.150 --> 34:26.090]  no idea
[34:26.750 --> 34:28.890]  at all. I wouldn't even know where to start at what this
[34:28.890 --> 34:30.690]  looks like from a bystanders
[34:30.690 --> 34:32.990]  point of view. I'll take a picture next time
[34:32.990 --> 34:34.790]  I'm there and then I can draw the
[34:35.850 --> 34:36.790]  path. How about that?
[34:37.090 --> 34:38.850]  I would love to see the video shoot
[34:38.850 --> 34:40.810]  of this. I think it would be a great trailer. Andrew
[34:40.810 --> 34:42.710]  you listened to all that right? I did
[34:42.710 --> 34:44.910]  yeah I listened. I have no idea. If you
[34:44.910 --> 34:46.790]  had to draw that what would you put?
[34:47.570 --> 34:48.970]  It would be a wall
[34:48.970 --> 34:50.730]  and then like I don't know what I'd do
[34:50.730 --> 34:52.230]  A wall that you can ride up?
[34:52.710 --> 34:55.070]  Yeah so it would be like kind of a side wall I guess
[34:55.070 --> 34:56.950]  and then a loop. And it sounds like your
[34:56.950 --> 34:58.530]  trick is just ollieing?
[34:58.830 --> 35:00.890]  No the trick is you ride up a wall
[35:00.890 --> 35:02.690]  no the trick is you come out of a turn
[35:03.450 --> 35:04.470]  immediately ride up
[35:04.470 --> 35:06.350]  take a left, ride up a wall
[35:06.350 --> 35:08.970]  go about 8 feet in the air up on the wall
[35:08.970 --> 35:10.290]  come down the wall
[35:10.290 --> 35:12.750]  then bomb a culvert
[35:12.750 --> 35:14.590]  and then go up the other side and jump it
[35:15.110 --> 35:17.130]  Some kind of imagining like a
[35:17.130 --> 35:18.550]  like a bull Gavin
[35:18.550 --> 35:21.030]  like a skateboard, like he's going up
[35:21.030 --> 35:22.930]  and then down. It's like transitioning
[35:22.930 --> 35:24.630]  into a half pipe kind of
[35:24.630 --> 35:25.870]  I don't feel like
[35:25.870 --> 35:27.690]  I can't imagine
[35:28.330 --> 35:30.410]  I feel like it's less impressive
[35:30.870 --> 35:32.450]  I'm gonna have to come out and film this
[35:32.450 --> 35:33.910]  I need to see what's going on
[35:33.910 --> 35:37.130]  I don't understand exactly how this works
[35:37.130 --> 35:38.970]  and I don't, you seem to be
[35:38.970 --> 35:41.050]  applying like your way to generate
[35:41.050 --> 35:43.170]  speed as part of the trick and I don't feel like
[35:43.170 --> 35:45.050]  that's the trick. I feel like the trick is landing
[35:45.050 --> 35:46.930]  the air gap that you make
[35:46.930 --> 35:49.050]  The air gap is the most difficult part
[35:49.650 --> 35:51.270]  The wall thing is a little sketchy too
[35:51.270 --> 35:53.030]  Listen, if you'd wrecked on that wall as many times
[35:53.030 --> 35:54.710]  as I have, you'd have a healthy fear of it
[35:54.710 --> 35:57.050]  That's fair, but hey, you look good doing it with your
[35:57.050 --> 35:58.350]  chain. Look fantastic
[35:58.350 --> 36:01.030]  Well, you know, I hadn't considered that but I
[36:01.030 --> 36:02.890]  appreciate that. Thank you. Yeah, I do look good
[36:02.890 --> 36:05.010]  I cannot wait for Geoff to be
[36:05.010 --> 36:06.770]  pulled by his automated bike
[36:06.770 --> 36:08.790]  when his chain gets caught in the sprockets
[36:09.770 --> 36:10.910]  Some woman's just gonna be
[36:10.910 --> 36:12.590]  delivering cucumbers to the next house
[36:12.590 --> 36:14.550]  to see Geoff be dragged down
[36:14.550 --> 36:14.950]  the street
[36:16.810 --> 36:18.590]  If that were to happen, I hope to
[36:18.590 --> 36:19.810]  God somebody films it
[36:21.550 --> 36:22.630]  Just a guy being pulled
[36:22.630 --> 36:24.150]  by a bike with no one on it
[36:28.700 --> 36:29.840]  But he's doing all the work
[36:30.520 --> 36:32.440]  Just putting all that effort into that bike
[36:32.440 --> 36:34.280]  It's barely assisting at all
[36:34.280 --> 36:36.420]  Yeah, I want to make that trailer. That sounds
[36:36.420 --> 36:38.480]  good. Well, let's do it. I'm all about it, dude
[36:38.480 --> 36:40.340]  I've been practicing this
[36:40.340 --> 36:41.700]  trick for a while
[36:41.700 --> 36:43.580]  It's not too far from where you...
[36:43.580 --> 36:45.600]  It's easy for you to get to, Geoff
[36:45.600 --> 36:47.300]  Pretty sunny this weekend
[36:47.940 --> 36:49.920]  I'll be hitting that
[36:49.920 --> 36:51.440]  I'll be doing that trick every day
[36:51.440 --> 36:52.280]  between now and
[36:53.560 --> 36:55.120]  until I probably wreck
[36:56.420 --> 36:57.760]  I'll just go to that
[36:57.760 --> 36:59.840]  spot. You can just continue your bike
[36:59.840 --> 37:01.860]  ride. I'll just grab the shot and you just carry on
[37:01.860 --> 37:03.700]  The problem is
[37:03.700 --> 37:05.860]  now that I've done it successfully once
[37:05.860 --> 37:07.500]  I feel like I
[37:07.500 --> 37:09.220]  have to do it every time
[37:10.840 --> 37:11.940]  And then I'll just get
[37:12.640 --> 37:14.340]  braver and braver and faster and faster
[37:14.340 --> 37:16.000]  and that's when it gets worse
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.800]  Are you the kind of person that when
[37:18.180 --> 37:20.260]  someone's filming you, are you the kind of person who
[37:20.260 --> 37:22.240]  would hit it with even more speed or would you get nervous
[37:22.240 --> 37:24.260]  and slow down? Because there's two types
[37:24.260 --> 37:26.280]  of people. I would overcompensate by
[37:26.280 --> 37:28.160]  hitting it with more speed. That's what I thought
[37:28.160 --> 37:29.640]  Yeah, that's what I thought
[37:30.100 --> 37:32.320]  What were you going to say, Andrew? I was just
[37:32.320 --> 37:33.880]  hoping that you guys can do this this weekend
[37:33.880 --> 37:35.660]  I'm now... I'm excited
[37:35.660 --> 37:38.240]  if that is really in play. Is this happening
[37:38.240 --> 37:39.900]  this weekend? Can we lock this in now?
[37:39.900 --> 37:42.600]  If I grab the phantom and bring it out there, I think we can do it
[37:42.600 --> 37:44.280]  I think it should happen
[37:44.280 --> 37:46.360]  I will... I can't
[37:46.360 --> 37:48.340]  wait. By the way, we were supposed
[37:48.340 --> 37:50.260]  to... you were supposed to invite me over to go swimming this week
[37:50.260 --> 37:52.480]  and midweek, it's Thursday, you never did that
[37:54.740 --> 37:56.080]  What? I just remembered
[37:56.080 --> 37:57.960]  I just remembered, just now
[37:57.960 --> 38:00.020]  Oh, I had other people over again
[38:01.140 --> 38:02.400]  God damn it
[38:03.940 --> 38:06.280]  The chances are I know those people
[38:06.280 --> 38:07.760]  and they probably like me
[38:13.480 --> 38:15.360]  Maybe Gavin doesn't like you
[38:15.360 --> 38:20.640]  It was meant to be a midweek hang
[38:20.640 --> 38:22.140]  Andrew, I'm starting to pick up
[38:22.140 --> 38:24.320]  on the idea that maybe Gavin doesn't like me
[38:24.320 --> 38:24.740]  It's
[38:25.560 --> 38:27.820]  taken it a while to sink in, but it's becoming
[38:29.080 --> 38:29.960]  unavoidably clear
[38:29.960 --> 38:31.180]  Nah, not remotely true
[38:31.700 --> 38:33.180]  This is what happened, you were like
[38:34.200 --> 38:36.080]  You asked me, are you free on Thursday?
[38:36.080 --> 38:37.980]  And I said, but you're not
[38:38.520 --> 38:39.640]  Because we're doing this
[38:39.640 --> 38:40.340]  And you're like, oh
[38:40.700 --> 38:43.480]  No, I said, are you free on Wednesday? Because Emily's off on Wednesday
[38:43.480 --> 38:44.540]  and that'd be the best day
[38:44.540 --> 38:45.360]  And you're like, yeah, well
[38:45.800 --> 38:47.160]  And I said, okay, just let us know
[38:47.160 --> 38:49.480]  And you're like, yeah, alright, I'll invite some other people over and then we'll have fun
[38:50.140 --> 38:52.700]  Yeah, I messed that up
[38:54.020 --> 38:55.400]  I botched that, didn't I?
[38:55.920 --> 38:58.100]  I will say, Geoff, I don't think you need to be worried
[38:58.100 --> 39:00.140]  I don't expect our friendship to exist outside
[39:00.140 --> 39:01.600]  of the recordings of this podcast
[39:01.600 --> 39:04.200]  I would say tomorrow, but we've got to break shit
[39:04.200 --> 39:05.840]  And we've got to Dbox
[39:05.840 --> 39:07.560]  Yeah, you've got other people
[39:07.560 --> 39:08.760]  The Dbox family
[39:08.760 --> 39:13.020]  I don't think you should be worried, Geoff, until Gavin invites me ahead of you
[39:13.020 --> 39:14.140]  Then you've got a problem
[39:14.140 --> 39:16.560]  When I'm getting an out-of-country invite
[39:17.060 --> 39:18.340]  You wouldn't come, though
[39:18.340 --> 39:20.360]  Even if he did and you came
[39:20.360 --> 39:22.220]  I wouldn't find out about it for like six months anyway
[39:22.220 --> 39:24.780]  If you invited me in a non-COVID world
[39:24.780 --> 39:26.780]  If you invited me to a lunch
[39:26.780 --> 39:28.000]  on, let's say, a Thursday
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.900]  and it was a Monday and I got the invite
[39:29.900 --> 39:31.680]  I would make that lunch
[39:31.680 --> 39:34.060]  So, post-COVID, I can give you
[39:34.060 --> 39:35.360]  three days notice
[39:35.360 --> 39:37.540]  for an invite in Austin and you'll be there
[39:37.540 --> 39:38.500]  I'll be there
[39:38.500 --> 39:41.000]  You don't think I'm going to test
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.720]  I'm going to test the shit out of that
[39:42.720 --> 39:44.700]  Yeah, but then if I don't go, I don't lose anything
[39:44.700 --> 39:45.680]  When is post-COVID?
[39:47.320 --> 39:47.760]  2025
[39:48.680 --> 39:50.560]  That's a great point, yeah
[39:50.560 --> 39:51.860]  Six years from now
[39:51.860 --> 39:55.540]  Do you know that Andrew texted me the other day and he said he missed Outskirts?
[39:56.040 --> 39:56.520]  I did
[39:57.320 --> 40:00.420]  Okay, so this goes deeper than Gavin even realizes
[40:00.420 --> 40:01.340]  Uh oh
[40:01.340 --> 40:03.820]  I had the whole Property Brothers thing
[40:03.820 --> 40:06.020]  and they've done stuff to that app that is crazy
[40:06.020 --> 40:07.140]  that I don't need to get into
[40:07.140 --> 40:09.960]  but it's just they made some bizarre decisions
[40:09.960 --> 40:11.080]  on how that thing works
[40:12.680 --> 40:14.160]  It's less pay to win
[40:14.580 --> 40:16.760]  Okay, so I didn't plan on getting into it
[40:16.760 --> 40:18.340]  but so, how you play Property Brothers
[40:18.340 --> 40:19.520]  if you don't want to spend money
[40:19.520 --> 40:21.440]  is whenever you fully upgrade a house
[40:21.440 --> 40:23.400]  you get one hour of unlimited plays
[40:23.400 --> 40:26.060]  If you don't do that, you have to wait for your energy to fill
[40:26.060 --> 40:27.820]  So you'd have to be really smart
[40:27.820 --> 40:29.920]  with timing, okay, I'm going to upgrade this house
[40:29.920 --> 40:32.320]  then I have one hour to make as much cash as I can
[40:32.320 --> 40:33.340]  to upgrade the next house
[40:33.340 --> 40:36.000]  so I can try to chain it so I'm not having to wait
[40:36.000 --> 40:36.920]  for my thing to recharge
[40:36.920 --> 40:39.740]  I didn't really notice this, there were no ads
[40:39.740 --> 40:40.640]  in that game
[40:41.040 --> 40:44.040]  Typically when you play a free mobile game, you're constantly getting video ads
[40:44.040 --> 40:44.860]  They had none
[40:44.860 --> 40:46.880]  They finally added them
[40:47.860 --> 40:49.960]  but what happens is you can either watch
[40:49.960 --> 40:51.640]  an ad to gain energy
[40:51.640 --> 40:53.760]  or when you play a level
[40:53.760 --> 40:56.100]  if you don't beat it, they give you an option of
[40:56.100 --> 40:57.640]  end the level or pay money
[40:57.640 --> 40:59.680]  to keep playing, like 5 more turns
[41:00.540 --> 41:02.020]  or watch this ad
[41:02.020 --> 41:03.080]  and get 2 more turns
[41:03.080 --> 41:06.240]  So I was like, I can finish this in 2 more turns, I'll watch this ad
[41:06.240 --> 41:08.240]  I do it, I failed, I couldn't beat it
[41:08.240 --> 41:09.760]  Then I got the same prompt
[41:09.760 --> 41:12.040]  You can watch as many ads
[41:12.040 --> 41:14.220]  as you want and just keep playing the level
[41:14.220 --> 41:16.220]  You will never lose as long as
[41:16.220 --> 41:17.660]  you're willing to watch an ad
[41:17.660 --> 41:19.980]  you get 2 more turns, I did it for 8 turns
[41:19.980 --> 41:21.420]  You watched 8 ads?
[41:21.820 --> 41:24.400]  I watched 4 ads, I got 2 turns per ad
[41:24.400 --> 41:26.380]  I watched 4 ads, did
[41:26.380 --> 41:27.720]  8 turns, beat the level
[41:28.240 --> 41:30.300]  but it has completely ruined their
[41:30.880 --> 41:32.480]  microtransaction system, which is crazy
[41:32.480 --> 41:34.680]  to me. They don't care, they make money off the ads
[41:34.680 --> 41:36.260]  But I just feel like
[41:36.260 --> 41:38.420]  I've never played a mobile game where you
[41:38.420 --> 41:40.480]  can't lose and they've also
[41:40.480 --> 41:42.480]  completely negated the reason
[41:42.480 --> 41:44.500]  for spending money on it
[41:44.500 --> 41:46.060]  I don't know, why don't you see that?
[41:46.060 --> 41:48.340]  I understand what you're saying. No, I get it, but it's just such
[41:48.340 --> 41:50.540]  an odd way to do it, like why even have
[41:50.540 --> 41:52.540]  the entire store they've rendered pointless
[41:52.540 --> 41:54.780]  I'm just, I have to watch a 15 second
[41:54.780 --> 41:56.520]  ad. It's like they've given up on selling
[41:56.520 --> 41:58.580]  things. That's what is interesting about it
[41:58.580 --> 42:00.600]  I've never seen a mobile game do that. Maybe no one
[42:00.600 --> 42:01.960]  was doing the microtransaction
[42:01.960 --> 42:04.640]  I think that's logically probably what happened
[42:04.640 --> 42:06.460]  but I've never seen a game just declare
[42:06.460 --> 42:08.500]  like, we, our store is
[42:08.500 --> 42:10.420]  pointless, do not spend money here, just
[42:10.420 --> 42:12.340]  watch these ads, keep playing
[42:12.340 --> 42:14.500]  So I've moved on to, there's a Gordon
[42:14.500 --> 42:16.640]  Ramsey mobile game called like, Chef's
[42:16.640 --> 42:18.680]  Blast, and this is a weird
[42:18.680 --> 42:20.620]  thing, so it's playing that, and he does
[42:20.620 --> 42:22.720]  a surprising amount of voice work for
[42:22.720 --> 42:24.880]  it. So I was like, this is ridiculous
[42:24.880 --> 42:26.820]  you're solving puzzles, you're unlocking
[42:26.820 --> 42:28.760]  recipes, I think I could go two
[42:28.760 --> 42:30.500]  weeks just with the recipes I've unlocked
[42:30.500 --> 42:32.720]  it was a weird kind of just random challenge idea I had
[42:32.720 --> 42:34.800]  but, I'm playing this, and so
[42:34.800 --> 42:36.760]  I shared it as a joke, I like tweeted about
[42:36.760 --> 42:38.580]  it, and then I made a team
[42:38.580 --> 42:40.860]  for it, so I posted in the discord
[42:40.860 --> 42:42.820]  like, hey, anyone who wants to join my
[42:42.820 --> 42:44.980]  Gordon Ramsey Chef's Blast team
[42:44.980 --> 42:46.580]  this is what you search for
[42:47.060 --> 42:48.720]  and I woke up later
[42:48.720 --> 42:50.800]  and a bunch of people joined
[42:50.800 --> 42:52.780]  and there's a leaderboard for the team
[42:52.780 --> 42:54.600]  thing, and it became super competitive
[42:54.600 --> 42:56.960]  and I ended up spending my whole weekend
[42:56.960 --> 42:58.740]  playing Chef's Blast, I
[42:58.740 --> 43:00.820]  cleared a hundred puzzle levels in the first
[43:00.820 --> 43:02.760]  day, and it just kept going
[43:02.760 --> 43:04.920]  just everyone got super into
[43:04.920 --> 43:06.840]  it, and I realized part of that is
[43:06.840 --> 43:08.700]  that I missed doing outskirts, like I
[43:08.700 --> 43:10.700]  needed something competitive to fill
[43:10.700 --> 43:12.680]  that spot in my life, and it turned
[43:12.680 --> 43:14.400]  into Gordon Ramsey Chef's Blast
[43:14.400 --> 43:16.660]  people have gone mild, they've beaten
[43:16.660 --> 43:18.700]  the game, there's like 480 levels
[43:18.700 --> 43:21.040]  to Chef's Blast, somebody beat it, like it's absurd
[43:21.040 --> 43:22.800]  how into it everybody
[43:22.800 --> 43:24.520]  got, but it just turned into
[43:24.520 --> 43:26.720]  this is a joke to waking up of like, this is
[43:26.720 --> 43:28.720]  now the most important thing of my life, and
[43:28.720 --> 43:30.800]  I'm actually doing this because I miss outskirts
[43:30.800 --> 43:32.640]  as crazy as that is. There was something
[43:32.640 --> 43:34.380]  so special about outskirts from
[43:34.380 --> 43:36.740]  my perspective, because I really loved
[43:36.740 --> 43:38.000]  your streams, it was
[43:38.480 --> 43:40.540]  like my favorite TV show of the week
[43:41.120 --> 43:42.680]  but imagine if to get your
[43:42.680 --> 43:44.660]  TV show to come on, you had to play
[43:44.660 --> 43:46.800]  Halo better than the TV show
[43:46.800 --> 43:48.440]  could, and then the TV show comes on
[43:48.440 --> 43:50.600]  and then I'm so excited for the TV show to
[43:50.600 --> 43:52.640]  come on, and then the TV show just kicks you
[43:52.640 --> 43:54.580]  in the testicles, and then it's
[43:54.580 --> 43:56.480]  back on you for the next time. It's a really
[43:56.480 --> 43:58.140]  odd way to consume content.
[43:58.680 --> 44:00.600]  Does it have to be, like, was there something
[44:00.600 --> 44:02.640]  special about outskirts that made
[44:02.640 --> 44:04.620]  it unique to that challenge
[44:04.620 --> 44:06.420]  or could you play any other Halo level
[44:06.420 --> 44:08.520]  and just do it again? You don't have to shoot
[44:08.520 --> 44:10.560]  anything. Yeah, well, in my
[44:10.560 --> 44:12.460]  opinion, no. I think we could do other
[44:12.460 --> 44:14.500]  levels, it's just, I'm waiting for Gavin to
[44:14.500 --> 44:16.640]  make that call. If he wants to pick another level,
[44:16.760 --> 44:18.480]  I'd love to do it. I suggested
[44:18.480 --> 44:20.640]  ODST. Andrew sounds desperate,
[44:20.800 --> 44:22.420]  man, he's playing fucking pay-to-win
[44:22.420 --> 44:24.360]  building. I'm playing Chef Blast. He's desperate,
[44:24.460 --> 44:26.340]  he's been, ever since outskirts ended,
[44:26.480 --> 44:28.440]  he's been just coming up with ideas
[44:28.440 --> 44:30.480]  left and right, and they're all very good ideas, but I still
[44:30.480 --> 44:32.620]  think the thing that would anger him most
[44:32.620 --> 44:34.240]  is losing at outskirts again.
[44:34.720 --> 44:36.440]  Well, yeah, I talked, the problem with it
[44:36.440 --> 44:38.500]  though is, so, before
[44:38.500 --> 44:40.580]  we did any of this, before f***face
[44:40.580 --> 44:42.560]  was even a thing, I got into
[44:42.560 --> 44:44.600]  an argument with somebody about who had a
[44:44.600 --> 44:46.260]  higher leaderboard ranking in trials,
[44:46.560 --> 44:48.500]  and I saw that Gavin had all the best
[44:48.500 --> 44:50.480]  beginner times, and I think I've talked about this already,
[44:50.700 --> 44:52.780]  and I challenged Gavin, and
[44:52.780 --> 44:54.560]  I beat all of his times but
[44:54.560 --> 44:56.540]  one, and I played it
[44:56.540 --> 44:58.580]  every day, because trials is so easy to drop
[44:58.580 --> 45:00.500]  in and out of. It was how I started my morning,
[45:00.560 --> 45:02.440]  and it took me a hundred days to beat
[45:02.440 --> 45:04.320]  Gavin's time. I just do it every day.
[45:04.780 --> 45:06.460]  And you can't really do that with outskirts,
[45:06.540 --> 45:08.400]  like, you need momentum, it's at least like an
[45:08.400 --> 45:10.320]  hour-long commitment to even
[45:10.320 --> 45:12.460]  get a run, like you can't, there's a
[45:12.460 --> 45:14.460]  flow to it, so it's tough. I know you
[45:14.460 --> 45:16.680]  want to beat that time, I just don't see you ever having
[45:16.680 --> 45:18.460]  a large enough block
[45:18.460 --> 45:20.380]  that you could purely dedicate to
[45:20.380 --> 45:22.400]  purely annoyment, to just annoyment.
[45:22.860 --> 45:24.520]  Yeah. I don't think it happens. There will be
[45:24.520 --> 45:26.380]  a time in my future where
[45:26.380 --> 45:28.400]  I can do that, I think. Probably, I
[45:28.400 --> 45:30.360]  think it'd be more interesting, though, if we just picked a
[45:30.360 --> 45:32.180]  different level. You know what?
[45:32.600 --> 45:34.360]  You know what, Andrew Padson?
[45:34.720 --> 45:36.220]  What? If I go to England,
[45:36.700 --> 45:37.840]  I'm going to have to quarantine
[45:38.380 --> 45:40.360]  for, like, ten days, or five
[45:40.360 --> 45:42.200]  if I do the test after day five.
[45:42.340 --> 45:43.940]  Uh-huh. That might be all I need.
[45:44.340 --> 45:46.260]  Are you saying for, like, an outskirts,
[45:46.320 --> 45:47.500]  you're going to set a new outskirts time?
[45:48.000 --> 45:49.880]  Maybe. Just got to bring an Xbox,
[45:50.620 --> 45:52.340]  five straight days of outskirts,
[45:52.480 --> 45:53.700]  oh, I think I can get that done.
[45:54.340 --> 45:54.700]  Ooh!
[45:56.420 --> 45:58.120]  You were so unhappy.
[45:58.760 --> 46:00.280]  I talked to you on that last
[46:00.280 --> 46:02.160]  day, the day you lost, and I've never heard you
[46:02.160 --> 46:03.220]  sound so depressed, Gavin.
[46:03.760 --> 46:04.600]  It was sad.
[46:04.800 --> 46:07.160]  It was the end of something special for us.
[46:07.480 --> 46:09.160]  It was. And also,
[46:09.800 --> 46:11.240]  it's gone. Like, those streams
[46:11.240 --> 46:12.960]  have vanished. Twitch has removed them.
[46:13.240 --> 46:15.100]  They, I guess, expired, so there's no VOD
[46:15.100 --> 46:16.840]  of that happening. Why didn't you save them?
[46:17.360 --> 46:19.280]  I didn't... well, typically, they last, like,
[46:19.300 --> 46:21.240]  a month. And they change their policies
[46:21.240 --> 46:23.160]  on, like, how long they last. It was, like, a week.
[46:24.200 --> 46:25.140]  Does that mean Donkey Kong's
[46:25.140 --> 46:27.120]  gone as well? Oh, Donkey Kong
[46:27.120 --> 46:29.200]  is long gone, but nobody needed to
[46:29.200 --> 46:31.220]  see Donkey Kong. I love this
[46:31.220 --> 46:33.120]  because I agree with Gavin that
[46:33.120 --> 46:35.060]  it turned into great TV.
[46:35.280 --> 46:37.320]  My favorite TV of the last few years
[46:37.320 --> 46:39.200]  was when Andrew was doing his
[46:39.680 --> 46:40.800]  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner
[46:40.800 --> 46:42.960]  monthly challenge in
[46:42.960 --> 46:45.100]  PUBG and then those
[46:45.100 --> 46:47.220]  streams in Halo.
[46:47.920 --> 46:49.340]  Except it's even better for me because
[46:49.340 --> 46:51.280]  it never punches me in the face. I just get to
[46:51.280 --> 46:52.740]  watch it and then get out.
[46:53.340 --> 46:55.180]  So I would love it if you guys would strike this up again
[46:55.180 --> 46:56.840]  because I... I'll be honest with you, man.
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.180]  I've watched 11 seasons of Survivor in the last
[46:59.180 --> 47:01.040]  three weeks and I could use a diff...
[47:01.040 --> 47:02.100]  maybe some variety.
[47:06.080 --> 47:07.180]  I think the best part
[47:07.180 --> 47:09.080]  of when I texted Gavin that I missed
[47:09.080 --> 47:10.960]  Outskirts, I put a question mark on it.
[47:11.060 --> 47:12.160]  Like, in my core,
[47:13.180 --> 47:15.140]  I didn't mean to, but my core was just
[47:15.140 --> 47:17.240]  like, do you actually? Because it was terrible
[47:17.240 --> 47:19.180]  while you're in it. Is this, like, you're just
[47:19.180 --> 47:21.020]  remembering the good parts, the fun of it.
[47:21.180 --> 47:23.080]  But I would love to have another Outskirts in our life.
[47:23.460 --> 47:24.460]  That was fun. One day.
[47:24.780 --> 47:27.200]  One day. We'll see. I mean, it sounds
[47:27.200 --> 47:29.340]  like it could be close, depending on...
[47:29.340 --> 47:31.080]  I told Gavin this.
[47:31.100 --> 47:33.180]  So last time we talked about this, you presented
[47:33.180 --> 47:34.960]  it as, like, I would be annoyed by it.
[47:34.980 --> 47:37.320]  And I was very much like, no, I'd be fine. I'm happy
[47:37.320 --> 47:39.220]  with where it was. I tried
[47:39.220 --> 47:41.140]  to get the time back. I wanted
[47:41.140 --> 47:43.160]  to do, like, the King of Kong thing, you know,
[47:43.180 --> 47:44.920]  where, like, Steve Wiebes sets the new record
[47:44.920 --> 47:46.780]  and then Billy Mitchell has that, like, random
[47:46.780 --> 47:49.260]  video tape. Yeah, he just, like, submits
[47:49.260 --> 47:51.280]  a VHS tape of the new time. I wanted
[47:51.280 --> 47:52.900]  to get a time faster than the
[47:52.900 --> 47:54.940]  339 and just sit at that
[47:54.940 --> 47:57.120]  final checkpoint and wait for you.
[47:57.340 --> 47:58.980]  And I just, I tried and I was
[47:58.980 --> 48:00.940]  impatient. I was like, I think this might be it. I got
[48:00.940 --> 48:02.860]  340. I don't think I'll ever
[48:02.860 --> 48:04.760]  pass 339. So if you
[48:04.760 --> 48:06.520]  hit, like, a 338,
[48:06.940 --> 48:09.040]  maybe it's, like, the minimum mile or whatever.
[48:09.300 --> 48:10.960]  Like, it's good. The bar will be raced.
[48:11.580 --> 48:13.060]  Oh, just getting flashbacks.
[48:13.520 --> 48:15.500]  It's a miserable time while you're in it.
[48:15.920 --> 48:17.040]  That's fun. It'll be
[48:17.040 --> 48:19.100]  fun. Think about how much fun everybody but
[48:19.100 --> 48:20.880]  you has. Why don't you try it?
[48:21.780 --> 48:22.960]  I would love to see Geoff
[48:22.960 --> 48:24.900]  try it. Oh, no, it's okay. I don't have to do that kind
[48:24.900 --> 48:26.180]  of stuff. I'm gonna do a sweet
[48:26.760 --> 48:28.520]  bike trick. I'll do that.
[48:29.800 --> 48:30.680]  I provide
[48:31.620 --> 48:33.260]  entertainment in scabs
[48:33.260 --> 48:34.680]  for f***face.
[48:34.860 --> 48:36.020]  You guys do the video game.
[48:37.540 --> 48:38.480]  Scabs and chains.
[48:38.940 --> 48:40.700]  Yeah, scabs and chains, baby. And shit.
[48:40.900 --> 48:41.760]  And just literal shit.
[48:45.760 --> 48:46.940]  That tell you guys about
[48:46.940 --> 48:48.860]  my shit triangle this week?
[48:49.280 --> 48:50.920]  No. Fucking hell.
[48:50.920 --> 48:52.920]  So, the other day I wake up
[48:54.300 --> 48:54.700]  and
[48:55.360 --> 48:56.700]  I see Arrow
[48:57.280 --> 48:58.340]  in the hallway
[48:59.660 --> 49:00.460]  and Emily,
[49:00.780 --> 49:02.820]  usually I get up, you know, she barks
[49:02.820 --> 49:04.740]  and lets me know sometime between
[49:04.740 --> 49:07.080]  typically about 5am and 7am.
[49:07.440 --> 49:08.540]  Hey, dickhead, if you
[49:08.540 --> 49:10.600]  I need to go to the bathroom and if I encounter
[49:10.600 --> 49:12.920]  one second of resistance, I'm gonna do it.
[49:13.320 --> 49:14.340]  All over everything.
[49:14.620 --> 49:16.580]  So I run out and I try to get her outside.
[49:16.820 --> 49:19.060]  And I'm successful 99% of the time.
[49:19.060 --> 49:21.060]  But this, I guess maybe Monday or Tuesday
[49:21.060 --> 49:23.140]  Emily got up to go to work and
[49:23.140 --> 49:25.000]  I slept in a little bit and so
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.720]  she let Arrow out. And then
[49:26.720 --> 49:29.060]  I just felt weird and so I got up and I looked
[49:29.060 --> 49:30.420]  and Arrow, I just saw Arrow in the hallway.
[49:30.760 --> 49:32.860]  But something felt odd, I couldn't figure it out. And then I realized
[49:32.860 --> 49:35.060]  she was taking a shit in the hallway. So I ran in
[49:35.060 --> 49:37.040]  there and I was like, oh no, the sliding glass door
[49:37.040 --> 49:38.760]  had been left shut. So
[49:38.760 --> 49:41.100]  I went to open it and like kind of run around her
[49:41.100 --> 49:43.220]  while she's dumping on the carpet in the hallway.
[49:43.520 --> 49:45.020]  And I fucking, first off
[49:45.020 --> 49:46.940]  I kicked the shit barefoot.
[49:46.940 --> 49:48.340]  So I got some shit on my big toe.
[49:49.800 --> 49:50.360]  It's like
[49:50.860 --> 49:52.880]  7.15 in the morning and I got a shitty big toe.
[49:53.380 --> 49:54.780]  And I hit the, so I just keep
[49:54.780 --> 49:57.060]  I just don't break stride, I just keep running
[49:57.060 --> 49:58.980]  into the kitchen to get to the paper
[49:58.980 --> 50:01.000]  towels or something. How did you kick it
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.460]  though? Because surely you were looking at it.
[50:02.460 --> 50:05.040]  I was trying to run around her
[50:05.780 --> 50:06.920]  and I just
[50:06.920 --> 50:09.220]  like, she didn't shit in a straight line
[50:09.220 --> 50:10.640]  anymore, she's old.
[50:11.100 --> 50:12.400]  And so there was like
[50:12.840 --> 50:15.220]  it was like a landmine of turds
[50:15.220 --> 50:16.520]  to circumnavigate.
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.940]  And so I clipped one. Anyway,
[50:19.160 --> 50:21.340]  and so I get into the kitchen and as I'm realizing
[50:21.340 --> 50:22.800]  there's a little bit of duty on my toe
[50:22.800 --> 50:25.020]  I hit, I didn't see this
[50:25.020 --> 50:26.380]  because the lights are out, I hit the P.
[50:26.760 --> 50:29.120]  And I slide across the kitchen on
[50:29.120 --> 50:31.120]  P. I don't fall.
[50:31.460 --> 50:33.220]  I don't fall, but I definitely do
[50:33.220 --> 50:35.160]  like Tom Cruise risky business.
[50:36.180 --> 50:37.060]  But barefoot
[50:37.060 --> 50:39.240]  across the P. And so I'm like, now both
[50:39.240 --> 50:41.200]  feet are just soaked in piss and I still
[50:41.200 --> 50:43.320]  got the duty. And I'm like, and I spring into action
[50:43.320 --> 50:45.340]  I clean it all up, it's no big deal. Emily actually cleans most
[50:45.340 --> 50:46.900]  of it up because she was horrified.
[50:47.160 --> 50:49.200]  You keep going, you slide up the wall, up the column.
[50:49.340 --> 50:51.020]  No, no, no, that was it. That was it, right?
[50:51.100 --> 50:52.140]  That was it. Then
[50:53.760 --> 50:55.360]  then later that day
[50:55.840 --> 50:57.340]  I was outside cleaning
[50:57.340 --> 50:59.220]  up dog shit and I was barefoot.
[51:00.020 --> 51:01.420]  And I cleaned up all the dog
[51:01.420 --> 51:03.300]  shit and I turned around and I stepped right
[51:03.300 --> 51:04.860]  in a big pile of dog shit that I missed.
[51:05.040 --> 51:07.220]  And I like, I looked down as I stepped
[51:07.220 --> 51:08.960]  in it and like, it's like
[51:08.960 --> 51:11.180]  squeezed up through my toes. Like I could see
[51:11.180 --> 51:13.120]  me barefoot. I just
[51:13.120 --> 51:15.000]  I just didn't think, you know?
[51:15.340 --> 51:17.260]  And so there was
[51:17.260 --> 51:19.220]  like a pee incident and then two poopy
[51:19.220 --> 51:20.980]  incidents, right? Oh, so that
[51:20.980 --> 51:23.100]  I count the pee and the poop one together. So
[51:23.100 --> 51:25.100]  then I was getting in Emily's car the
[51:25.100 --> 51:26.320]  other day because we had to take Henry
[51:27.160 --> 51:28.520]  Henry needed to go to the doctor
[51:29.340 --> 51:30.540]  Was it because of his sneeze?
[51:31.140 --> 51:33.000]  No, he had a funny sneeze around you though.
[51:33.360 --> 51:34.660]  No, he has a, it was a
[51:35.180 --> 51:36.740]  some other stuff. But
[51:37.360 --> 51:39.140]  and I guess he'd been stressed
[51:39.140 --> 51:41.380]  out because he had to visit a cardiologist
[51:41.380 --> 51:43.040]  and he had to wear like a special doggy vest
[51:43.040 --> 51:45.240]  and he had maybe leaked a
[51:45.240 --> 51:47.060]  little poop in the seat and I didn't
[51:47.060 --> 51:48.600]  know it and I just sat right down in it.
[51:49.220 --> 51:51.200]  And then Emily's like, uh, hold on
[51:51.200 --> 51:53.220]  and then she ran in the house and ran back out. I didn't even know
[51:53.220 --> 51:55.220]  and then she like gets me up and I realize that I've sat in
[51:55.220 --> 51:57.360]  in a little bit of butt squirt.
[51:57.740 --> 51:59.120]  So that, that was all in the
[51:59.120 --> 52:01.040]  span of two days and then it
[52:01.040 --> 52:01.420]  hit me.
[52:02.720 --> 52:04.600]  It hit me that
[52:05.060 --> 52:07.180]  with the exception of those three incidents, things
[52:07.180 --> 52:09.200]  have been going pretty well for me since I got back
[52:09.200 --> 52:11.160]  from Florida. And I think
[52:11.160 --> 52:13.280]  I realized that
[52:13.280 --> 52:15.100]  if I don't step on shit,
[52:15.480 --> 52:16.480]  shit steps on me.
[52:17.540 --> 52:18.400]  And that's
[52:19.180 --> 52:21.340]  when I realized that that's my place in the universe.
[52:21.660 --> 52:23.320]  I gotta stop trying to
[52:23.320 --> 52:25.380]  avoid the literal shit in my life.
[52:25.940 --> 52:26.980]  That my, the universe
[52:26.980 --> 52:29.280]  will let me exist
[52:29.280 --> 52:31.220]  in a reasonably like a C
[52:31.220 --> 52:32.660]  plus B minus life
[52:32.660 --> 52:35.180]  manner. As long as I
[52:35.180 --> 52:36.900]  stop trying to
[52:36.900 --> 52:38.760]  jump my station
[52:38.760 --> 52:40.960]  trying to live above
[52:40.960 --> 52:43.300]  the literal feces and urine
[52:43.300 --> 52:44.660]  of the universe.
[52:45.620 --> 52:47.060]  That's not gonna work for me.
[52:47.300 --> 52:49.120]  Anytime I try to get a big head
[52:49.120 --> 52:51.140]  and I try to think like, oh no, I'm better
[52:51.140 --> 52:51.940]  than dog shit.
[52:52.500 --> 52:55.200]  I'm gonna live a life that doesn't require
[52:55.200 --> 52:56.780]  me to live in
[52:56.780 --> 52:58.880]  mired in dog shit and
[52:58.880 --> 53:00.260]  human shit and other kinds of shit.
[53:00.760 --> 53:02.880]  The universe says, it hits me,
[53:02.880 --> 53:04.720]  it knocks me, whack-a-moles me right back
[53:04.720 --> 53:06.820]  into the turds, right? So I'm just
[53:06.820 --> 53:08.160]  gonna embrace it.
[53:08.820 --> 53:10.960]  I'm not gonna be better, I'm not gonna try to be better than shit
[53:10.960 --> 53:12.940]  anymore. I'm just gonna step on the
[53:12.940 --> 53:15.000]  shit. You can at least make it easier and not
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.300]  be barefoot all the time.
[53:16.780 --> 53:18.940]  I mean... That is true, you can reduce
[53:18.940 --> 53:20.960]  How often... I don't think
[53:20.960 --> 53:22.700]  it's out of the ordinary
[53:22.700 --> 53:25.020]  to expect to be barefoot in my kitchen
[53:25.020 --> 53:26.320]  in my hallway at seven in the morning.
[53:26.940 --> 53:28.880]  I thought you were a sock guy. I wear shoes enough.
[53:29.280 --> 53:30.360]  I thought you were a big sock person.
[53:30.360 --> 53:31.440]  I had just
[53:32.140 --> 53:34.480]  woken up. I hadn't taken a shower yet.
[53:34.560 --> 53:36.320]  I hadn't gotten dressed yet. I was
[53:36.320 --> 53:37.880]  in underwear, walking, you know?
[53:38.300 --> 53:40.600]  I feel like a shoe... a sock
[53:40.600 --> 53:41.720]  is no better than a barefoot.
[53:42.260 --> 53:44.040]  Yeah, a sock in some ways would be worse.
[53:44.640 --> 53:46.100]  I'd have to wash a sock.
[53:46.760 --> 53:48.340]  I'd throw the sock away, right?
[53:48.400 --> 53:50.500]  And then I'd lose a fucking sock. That was more of my annoyance
[53:50.500 --> 53:52.280]  that you called me weird for never being a
[53:52.280 --> 53:54.400]  sock person. That's what that comment was about.
[53:54.840 --> 53:56.220]  I issued the
[53:56.220 --> 53:58.260]  first, and to my recollection
[53:58.260 --> 54:00.260]  only, official f***face retraction
[54:00.260 --> 54:01.800]  over the last year. That is true.
[54:01.880 --> 54:04.340]  I apologized and it admitted
[54:04.920 --> 54:06.400]  the heaps of hypocrisy
[54:06.400 --> 54:08.000]  that I reaped on you.
[54:08.340 --> 54:10.160]  I can only apologize so much, Andrew.
[54:10.440 --> 54:12.160]  That's fair. Would you like to confess
[54:12.160 --> 54:13.580]  now you didn't drink the soda before?
[54:13.760 --> 54:16.140]  That this was the first real attempt? I 100%
[54:16.140 --> 54:16.780]  drank the soda.
[54:17.980 --> 54:20.060]  And Nick went back and listened to it again
[54:20.060 --> 54:22.180]  and he even verified that he could hear it
[54:22.180 --> 54:23.920]  and just to prove this time
[54:23.920 --> 54:25.680]  I couldn't post it on Discord for some reason
[54:25.680 --> 54:26.820]  so I posted
[54:27.760 --> 54:29.880]  the video of me drinking it in the
[54:29.880 --> 54:31.980]  Slack. You guys could watch me drink this stupid thing.
[54:32.600 --> 54:33.600]  The second one was verified.
[54:33.600 --> 54:34.400]  I just watched it.
[54:35.080 --> 54:36.700]  I was there. He's drinking it.
[54:38.000 --> 54:38.880]  Drink the shit out of it.
[54:40.060 --> 54:41.800]  If I had more sodas I would
[54:41.800 --> 54:43.040]  do the two and do the 30 seconds.
[54:43.600 --> 54:45.760]  Eric just said it looks like a small Coke.
[54:45.820 --> 54:47.040]  Was that a regulation can?
[54:47.540 --> 54:48.900]  Yeah, it's 300... hold on.
[54:50.360 --> 54:52.100]  355 milliliters, 12 fluid ounces.
[54:52.340 --> 54:53.380]  Yeah, that looks regulation.
[54:53.380 --> 54:54.600]  That's a good chug.
[54:54.960 --> 54:57.420]  You're very fast as far as timing goes.
[54:57.820 --> 54:59.660]  Get a nice view of the shelves in the background too.
[55:00.420 --> 55:01.480]  That's very important.
[55:02.120 --> 55:03.180]  Gavin came over
[55:03.180 --> 55:04.760]  and he saw the shelves for the first time
[55:04.760 --> 55:07.080]  and then he seemed to dislike
[55:07.080 --> 55:09.280]  my podcast setup. He just kept saying
[55:09.280 --> 55:11.240]  I don't... this doesn't seem like
[55:11.240 --> 55:13.220]  where you would record. This doesn't feel right.
[55:13.740 --> 55:14.960]  He seemed bothered by it.
[55:15.120 --> 55:17.060]  When I picture you doing this
[55:17.060 --> 55:19.160]  when I'm picturing you right now, you're not in there
[55:19.160 --> 55:20.720]  for some reason. Where am I?
[55:21.100 --> 55:21.580]  I don't know.
[55:23.520 --> 55:24.220]  Now that I've
[55:24.220 --> 55:26.500]  set foot in there, I can picture you better more.
[55:27.120 --> 55:27.260]  What?
[55:31.500 --> 55:32.640]  But like right now,
[55:32.740 --> 55:34.860]  I can't really picture Andrew. I've never seen Andrew's
[55:34.860 --> 55:36.620]  entire room, I don't think. So I don't
[55:36.620 --> 55:38.580]  really see him in my mind.
[55:39.380 --> 55:40.460]  I'd love to see
[55:40.460 --> 55:42.820]  a blueprint of what
[55:42.820 --> 55:44.400]  you think it looks like. The setup.
[55:44.860 --> 55:46.920]  That's a great question. When I see Andrew's
[55:46.920 --> 55:48.840]  bedroom, the first thing that pops into me, I see a
[55:48.840 --> 55:50.780]  wall. On the left is a door.
[55:50.940 --> 55:52.700]  To the right is a bed
[55:52.700 --> 55:54.860]  with a nightstand with a bunch of things that
[55:54.860 --> 55:57.000]  don't belong on it. Then on the floor on the
[55:57.000 --> 55:58.960]  left is a sushi container.
[55:59.520 --> 56:00.880]  And in the bed
[56:01.860 --> 56:02.660]  is a
[56:02.660 --> 56:05.100]  keyboard that's as big as the bed.
[56:05.520 --> 56:07.100]  And then behind me, I can't
[56:07.100 --> 56:09.100]  see it, but I assume it's a desk and a fire extinguisher.
[56:09.240 --> 56:10.300]  And that's Andrew's room to me.
[56:10.580 --> 56:12.760]  Yeah, I'm seeing the bed in the corner. It's got the eight pillars.
[56:12.880 --> 56:15.000]  It's got the keyboard. There is a bunch of
[56:15.000 --> 56:16.840]  just shit and sushi and
[56:16.840 --> 56:18.900]  ming and all. Probably like a
[56:18.900 --> 56:20.980]  mashed in muffin or something.
[56:21.240 --> 56:22.660]  No. On the floor.
[56:22.900 --> 56:24.340]  And then a fridge.
[56:25.060 --> 56:26.160]  A sauce drawer.
[56:26.880 --> 56:28.900]  A desk that isn't suitable as
[56:28.900 --> 56:30.960]  a desk. Probably more of like a drawer
[56:30.960 --> 56:31.400]  thing.
[56:33.080 --> 56:34.860]  It's made of Lego. I thought I could do you a
[56:34.860 --> 56:37.140]  diagram. I'd love to see a diagram
[56:37.140 --> 56:38.820]  of what you think. We should both draw
[56:39.660 --> 56:40.440]  Andrew's bedroom.
[56:40.860 --> 56:42.260]  Yeah. I'd love to see it. Yeah.
[56:42.820 --> 56:44.380]  Okay. I want to do that. Okay.
[56:44.380 --> 56:45.580]  That's a great idea.
[56:46.300 --> 56:47.560]  Those are the top standard ears.
[56:49.500 --> 56:50.260]  Like, Andrew,
[56:50.400 --> 56:52.180]  do you picture Geoff in his
[56:52.180 --> 56:54.440]  shelf room? Like whenever we're doing these audio
[56:54.440 --> 56:56.240]  only? I picture
[56:56.240 --> 56:58.380]  Geoff as just purely in a room
[56:58.380 --> 57:00.140]  of shelves. I only see shelves.
[57:00.280 --> 57:02.380]  There's nothing else in the room. There's no door.
[57:02.680 --> 57:03.400]  He records from an Ikea.
[57:03.980 --> 57:06.640]  Yeah, it's sort of like the end of Interstellar
[57:06.640 --> 57:08.240]  where we're leaning into Interstellar,
[57:08.280 --> 57:10.080]  but like the bookshelf thing, like going down,
[57:10.160 --> 57:12.040]  that's just all I see. It's just shelving
[57:12.040 --> 57:13.940]  everywhere, is how I imagine
[57:13.940 --> 57:16.160]  Geoff's setup. And he's just looking between the books
[57:16.160 --> 57:18.240]  at just different piles of shit. Yeah, exactly.
[57:18.600 --> 57:20.180]  Yeah. That's what I see.
[57:20.480 --> 57:22.360]  It's all just left socks and turds.
[57:23.640 --> 57:24.040]  Here.
[57:24.420 --> 57:26.120]  Here, this is what you would
[57:26.120 --> 57:28.080]  see. That's a lot less interesting than
[57:28.080 --> 57:29.920]  what I imagined. It's just, it looks like a nice space.
[57:29.920 --> 57:31.060]  Yeah, I'm sorry that there's...
[57:31.060 --> 57:33.900]  I just picked up all my left socks off the floor,
[57:34.000 --> 57:34.260]  unfortunately.
[57:36.060 --> 57:37.960]  Did you tuck the chain back in? I don't see
[57:37.960 --> 57:42.020]  the chain. Did the chain go back under? Yeah, the chain's
[57:42.820 --> 57:44.300]  It's alright, don't worry about it.
[57:44.440 --> 57:45.720]  The chain's always there. I'm a chain guy now.
[57:45.740 --> 57:47.520]  Alright, so Andrew, if we both draw
[57:48.200 --> 57:50.000]  your room, could you then
[57:50.000 --> 57:51.880]  turn around in your chair and take a picture of it
[57:51.880 --> 57:53.920]  for next week or something, so we can
[57:53.920 --> 57:55.860]  cross-reference? Uh, yeah,
[57:55.980 --> 57:57.260]  I could do that. Okay.
[57:57.380 --> 57:59.920]  So, our homework is that we'll both
[57:59.920 --> 58:01.760]  draw a schematic of your bedroom.
[58:02.280 --> 58:03.780]  Now, can you give us any
[58:03.780 --> 58:06.040]  instruction? Like, obviously, like the nose at the top
[58:06.040 --> 58:07.800]  standard is, which were actually
[58:07.800 --> 58:09.960]  very good instructions, I thought. Okay.
[58:09.960 --> 58:11.840]  Can you give us any tips
[58:11.840 --> 58:13.820]  on the room? Yeah, okay, you want me to
[58:13.820 --> 58:16.200]  explain the layout, kind of like the key landmarks?
[58:16.240 --> 58:17.940]  Well, don't give too much away, but just
[58:17.940 --> 58:19.920]  like something that needs to be in there that you
[58:19.920 --> 58:21.920]  think we'll never get. Like, for instance,
[58:22.180 --> 58:24.100]  how many doors are in the room?
[58:24.600 --> 58:25.240]  Three doors.
[58:25.840 --> 58:28.000]  You said three? I have three doors. So, bedroom,
[58:28.280 --> 58:29.380]  bathroom, and closet?
[58:29.940 --> 58:31.900]  Uh, I don't ha- uh, four doors,
[58:31.980 --> 58:33.960]  I guess, technically, if you want to- well,
[58:35.120 --> 58:36.440]  there could be a door there.
[58:36.580 --> 58:38.180]  What? It could hypothetically
[58:38.180 --> 58:40.180]  be a door- there isn't a door, but there could
[58:40.180 --> 58:41.360]  be a door to that space.
[58:42.700 --> 58:43.660]  There's three-
[58:44.080 --> 58:45.280]  There's three doors. I'm just gonna-
[58:45.280 --> 58:47.400]  I'm imagining something out of Monsters, Inc.
[58:47.840 --> 58:49.820]  Door- door at the front.
[58:50.660 --> 58:52.100]  Door at the front left.
[58:52.880 --> 58:54.060]  Door at the front right.
[58:54.360 --> 58:55.020]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[58:56.320 --> 58:57.780]  So, okay, so say
[58:57.780 --> 59:00.020]  we're looking at- we're drawing this from the perspective
[59:00.020 --> 59:01.720]  of if you had a webcam.
[59:02.100 --> 59:04.060]  Okay, yeah. Are there
[59:04.060 --> 59:06.140]  four doors in the view? I don't think
[59:06.140 --> 59:08.220]  you'd see any of the doors in the view if I had a webcam.
[59:13.830 --> 59:15.870]  If I had a webcam, yeah, I don't think you'd see any
[59:15.870 --> 59:17.550]  of the- you might- well, maybe-
[59:17.550 --> 59:19.430]  Okay, no doors.
[59:20.190 --> 59:21.930]  How many windows are in the room?
[59:22.630 --> 59:24.010]  Uh, does it-
[59:24.610 --> 59:25.750]  Oh my god.
[59:25.990 --> 59:27.110]  Well, technically, two.
[59:28.270 --> 59:28.970]  Technically, two.
[59:29.430 --> 59:30.810]  And how many can we see from there?
[59:31.350 --> 59:33.570]  Like, if we're trying to match Geoff's picture.
[59:34.030 --> 59:35.990]  I'm trying to figure out what the range would be
[59:35.990 --> 59:38.010]  of the webcam, of what would be-
[59:38.010 --> 59:39.170]  Uh, you would maybe-
[59:39.170 --> 59:41.970]  You'd maybe see like half a window.
[59:43.510 --> 59:45.270]  Window at the back, okay?
[59:46.950 --> 59:47.910]  Door to the front.
[59:48.110 --> 59:49.310]  Well, not too far to the back.
[59:50.170 --> 59:50.910]  Door to the front.
[59:51.770 --> 59:52.430]  Standard doors.
[59:53.370 --> 59:55.150]  Well, I just- I don't know, I'm giving instructions.
[59:55.330 --> 59:57.750]  You wanted me to not be specific. Door to the front.
[59:59.810 --> 01:00:00.850]  Door at the top.
[01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:03.870]  Standard doors to the side. Everything you're doing
[01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:05.150]  is making it worse.
[01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:07.770]  So the door is behind where the camera would be?
[01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.970]  Uh, one of the doors-
[01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:11.070]  Yeah, one of the doors, yeah.
[01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:13.850]  I thought the camera was against the desk
[01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:15.210]  which was against the wall
[01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:16.270]  where the window is.
[01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:19.130]  Uh, no.
[01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:21.430]  The wall-
[01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:22.930]  So, the camera-
[01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:24.930]  What shape is this room? How many walls do you have?
[01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:27.150]  Uh, well,
[01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:28.370]  one, two-
[01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:31.570]  It's a four, it's a standard, it's a regulation four-walled room.
[01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:32.770]  Okay, a standard box.
[01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:34.810]  But somehow, four doors
[01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:35.530]  on one wall.
[01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:38.330]  Uh, there's- there's-
[01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:40.670]  No, there's a door on every wall but one.
[01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:42.050]  Okay.
[01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:43.790]  We got multiple doors.
[01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:45.790]  So we're looking at the wall without doors.
[01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:48.190]  Uh, yeah.
[01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:49.710]  You'd see the door without walls.
[01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.950]  What?!
[01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:54.190]  The door- the wall-
[01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:55.150]  The wall without doors.
[01:00:56.330 --> 01:00:57.890]  Yeah, you know what I mean.
[01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:00.170]  Yeah, there's a wall at the back,
[01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.810]  wall back.
[01:01:00.810 --> 01:01:02.570]  This is like the end of Interstellar.
[01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:06.190]  Is your- is your- what's at the end of your bed
[01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:08.290]  on the other side? Like, your bed, it goes up against the
[01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:10.170]  wall, and then if you were, like, to scoot off
[01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.010]  of the front of it-
[01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:14.350]  I've just fully moved into the McDonald's and I don't want to admit it.
[01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:17.650]  I'm just creating a space.
[01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.490]  Where's the ball pit?
[01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:20.430]  Um, it sits to the back,
[01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:21.370]  obviously. Back left.
[01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:24.130]  Oh, we're never gonna find his damn apartment
[01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:25.010]  with his own instructions.
[01:01:25.170 --> 01:01:26.810]  We're gonna find where he's in his own room.
[01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:29.130]  Jesus Christ.
[01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:30.870]  Well, you want me to be vague? I could give very
[01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:32.790]  detailed instructions, but you wanna-
[01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:34.390]  you gotta kind of figure out where things are.
[01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:35.530]  Okay, alright.
[01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:38.410]  If you feel like we've got all the instructions-
[01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:40.310]  What? Doors at the top.
[01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.210]  Where do the doors go?
[01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:44.250]  Where do they lead?
[01:01:44.610 --> 01:01:46.790]  What do you mean by that? What do you mean they're at the top?
[01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.890]  The top of what?
[01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:50.890]  Well, the top of the- you know, if you're doing a space,
[01:01:51.090 --> 01:01:51.890]  doors at the top.
[01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:55.110]  That makes no sense.
[01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:57.430]  But they're not on the floor? What do you mean?
[01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:58.410]  Ceiling doors?
[01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:00.910]  No, I'm doing it under the system of
[01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:02.270]  no's at the top.
[01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:03.090]  Doors at the top.
[01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:06.070]  And then standard windows?
[01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:09.250]  Well, it's a pretty- no, I think one of them
[01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:10.390]  is not a standard window.
[01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:13.310]  Is a window in a door a window?
[01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:15.330]  Or is it just a door that has a window?
[01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:17.090]  Yeah, I've had dreams of it.
[01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:17.350]  Does it count?
[01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:21.150]  So one of your doors has a window in it?
[01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:23.750]  Yeah, one of the doors has a window in it.
[01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:25.130]  Is it an external door?
[01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:26.270]  Does it go outside the house?
[01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:27.290]  Yes, it does.
[01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:30.790]  Thank you, this actually helps.
[01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:31.990]  So you have a door to your bathroom,
[01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:34.870]  a door to the interior of your house,
[01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:36.270]  and then an exterior door.
[01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:37.230]  That is correct.
[01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:40.190]  I had no idea you had an exterior door.
[01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:42.610]  I have an exterior door.
[01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:45.770]  Well, it doesn't lead to-
[01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:46.910]  I can't just-
[01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:48.810]  I have a very limited space I can go to.
[01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:50.270]  And where are we on the-
[01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:51.910]  Like, the appliances in there.
[01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:53.270]  Do we have the Keurig in there still?
[01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:57.170]  We have the Keurig in there, the waffle maker's in my kitchen now.
[01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:58.630]  I made a waffle recently, actually.
[01:02:58.790 --> 01:02:59.310]  It's very good.
[01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:02.270]  Yeah, where's the piss lady in reference to this?
[01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.730]  She's to the left.
[01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:04.170]  Which window?
[01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:07.810]  Did you see her through the window in the door,
[01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:09.210]  or through the non-standard wall window?
[01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:11.270]  Great question. It was the door window.
[01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:12.490]  Door window, okay.
[01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:16.130]  I'd never used the window window.
[01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:18.670]  This has changed
[01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:21.570]  This has changed the geography of your bedroom for me.
[01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:22.790]  I almost, I will say,
[01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:24.950]  I had a brief moment.
[01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:26.310]  I bought an ice cream maker
[01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:28.770]  at, like, 1220 AM.
[01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:30.210]  I had never- I was just like,
[01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:31.650]  I want to make ice cream.
[01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:35.210]  I bought one, and then I went through the-
[01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:37.110]  And I thought, I could put it on the other end table
[01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:38.730]  so I could have a Keurig to the right
[01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:40.670]  and an ice cream maker to the left.
[01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.790]  I have a fridge, I could store what I needed.
[01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:45.550]  And then I realized, I don't know how ice cream is made.
[01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:46.730]  Ice cream goes in the freezer!
[01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:48.390]  Yeah, well, I could
[01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:50.730]  move it downstairs, but if I could just
[01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:52.810]  want, like, a little cone, like a cone
[01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:54.910]  for me, just a little- make a little small batch.
[01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:56.350]  I don't know how ice cream works.
[01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:58.670]  I realized it's a lot of effort. I thought you just
[01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:00.770]  poured milk and, like, some chocolate and
[01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:02.830]  stuff and- You've got, like, churn it up, haven't you?
[01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:04.810]  Yeah, it's like a whole- it's a whole
[01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:06.790]  process, so it's- Are you doing, like, an
[01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:09.010]  old-timey one? No, I googled
[01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:10.790]  what is the best ice cream maker
[01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:12.610]  and then I found it on Amazon
[01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:14.910]  and it was pretty cheap, so I bought it.
[01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:16.770]  And then, uh, I returned
[01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.910]  it, or I canceled my order, like, an hour later
[01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:20.990]  because I realized that's not a life I want to
[01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.870]  live. I'm not fully committed to the amount
[01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:24.790]  of effort it would take to properly
[01:04:24.790 --> 01:04:26.370]  use that thing. That's fair.
[01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:28.710]  Plus, you've barely- But it was a consideration.
[01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:30.890]  You've barely explored pickling, and that
[01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:32.570]  was a passing interest already.
[01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:35.110]  Well, I think- You know, I could be open to pickling.
[01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:36.890]  I had a surprise pickle
[01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:38.850]  and I enjoy- No, it was pickled onion,
[01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:40.870]  right? I had on the Wendy's Korean Burger?
[01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:42.590]  Yeah. Yeah, that was good.
[01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:44.570]  I could be into pickled things.
[01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:46.490]  I have some cucumbers if you need them.
[01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:47.070]  Yeah?
[01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:50.510]  I'd love some. I didn't know
[01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:52.670]  cucumbers were pickles. I talked about that before, but that
[01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:54.390]  was like a recent realization that
[01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:55.430]  blew my mind.
[01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:59.350]  Okay, well...
[01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:00.470]  Should we stop doing this?
[01:05:00.850 --> 01:05:02.430]  I think we can. I think we covered-
[01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:04.710]  Did you have anything else you need to talk about? You're a chain guy,
[01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:06.730]  you're doing tricks, Gavin's gonna film you on the weekend?
[01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:07.790]  What's for next week, Geoff?
[01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:10.670]  Oh, I guess I still had the tooth thing.
[01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:12.490]  I got a- I do have a charger
[01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:14.550]  cheek. That turned out to be a real thing.
[01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:16.670]  But we can save that for next week
[01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:18.730]  or we don't ever have to talk about my mouth again because I fucking
[01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:20.690]  hate talking about my mouth and my teeth anymore.
[01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:22.870]  Let's just say I'm not out of the woods.
[01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:24.230]  Let's just say there's a-
[01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:26.830]  Let's just say there's been a hole in my tooth for two fucking weeks
[01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:28.850]  and it's gonna continue to be there for a little bit.
[01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:30.550]  Can we extend just to like
[01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:32.510]  anyone who is listening to this,
[01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:34.670]  I'd love to see your blueprints of what I
[01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:36.630]  described. Oh, that's a great idea.
[01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:38.490]  And maybe we can find the closest one. If people could send in
[01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:40.690]  what they think based on the instructions
[01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:42.490]  how it looks and we'll value it. I might have to
[01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:44.230]  draw it from the top down.
[01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:46.630]  I'm done. I'm doing top down. Oh, obviously it's top down.
[01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:48.490]  Yeah, what way did you imagine it being drawn?
[01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:50.530]  I always assumed it was top down. I imagined
[01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:52.210]  like a blueprint. Yeah, well I was
[01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:54.470]  just gonna draw it from like what Geoff's picture
[01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:56.570]  looks like. I was just gonna draw you- Oh, that would be
[01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:58.390]  weird. I think that's a strange way to do it.
[01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:00.150]  Well, apparently it would. There's no doors over there or anything.
[01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:02.230]  Yeah, it would be a very boring view if you did that.
[01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:03.850]  I think you should do a top down,
[01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:06.430]  doors at the top, standard doors,
[01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:08.610]  well, two of them are standard, one of them
[01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:10.510]  has a window in it, that's the
[01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:11.890]  exterior one. Okay, so okay,
[01:06:12.290 --> 01:06:14.290]  so the final piece of information I need,
[01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:15.470]  if we're drawing top down,
[01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:18.470]  where is your desk if I'm looking
[01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:20.130]  top down? Desk at the top.
[01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:22.510]  Where's your bed? Bed at the
[01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:24.790]  back, bed at the bottom. So wait, you're facing
[01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:26.390]  up. Yeah, I'm facing
[01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:28.530]  up. Oh god, that's confusing me
[01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:30.450]  already. Alright. The beds
[01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:32.450]  at- wait, the desk's at the top and the bed's
[01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:34.510]  at the bottom? Yeah. And the
[01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:36.610]  doors are at the top? Doors are at the top.
[01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:38.670]  And the external doors
[01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:40.570]  at the top? External doors at the
[01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:42.590]  top. And the interior to your house
[01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:44.430]  doors at the top and the bathroom doors at the top?
[01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:45.450]  All the doors are
[01:06:46.410 --> 01:06:48.450]  top of the area, yes.
[01:06:48.490 --> 01:06:50.550]  If you drew a line in the middle of the
[01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:52.630]  room across, they would all be in the top
[01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:54.190]  area. Who would do that?
[01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:55.650]  So are you looking at a door?
[01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:58.250]  Uh, if I look to my left,
[01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:00.590]  like I could see a door, my peripheral I see a door.
[01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:02.590]  I'm not looking at it,
[01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:04.130]  but it's in my peripheral vision. Yes.
[01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:06.890]  I'm imagining a four-walled room
[01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:08.650]  with like four doors in one
[01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:10.570]  of the corners somehow. I don't know how it makes sense.
[01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:12.210]  It makes no goddamn sense, Gavin.
[01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:13.510]  I'm so confused.
[01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:16.690]  They're at the top. Alright. Three doors. I'm gonna draw that.
[01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:18.310]  One closet. That's important.
[01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:20.170]  One closet. Closet doesn't have a door.
[01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:22.370]  Could have a door. You could put a door there.
[01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:24.530]  Now is the closet, if we're looking at
[01:07:24.530 --> 01:07:26.430]  the top, at the fucking- at the wall
[01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:28.530]  of doors, you have an entire wall that's just
[01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:30.510]  doors, and so is the
[01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:32.010]  closet to the left or the right?
[01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:34.390]  There's only one door per
[01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:36.450]  wall, they're just all at the top.
[01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:38.770]  Um...
[01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:39.230]  Okay...
[01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:42.430]  You went into your closet
[01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:44.510]  to avoid the smoke getting
[01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:46.510]  in the fire, the smoke alarm,
[01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:48.250]  but it doesn't have a door.
[01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:50.530]  No, it's a walk-in closet. It's a little walk-in closet
[01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:52.630]  with no door. I didn't know, I didn't design
[01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:54.450]  it, I didn't build this place. You can put a door
[01:07:54.450 --> 01:07:55.890]  on it. How do you mean
[01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:58.430]  all four doors are at the top
[01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:59.870]  but they're not all on the same wall?
[01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:02.110]  There's no-
[01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:04.370]  If you want to call the closet a door that
[01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:06.390]  doesn't have a door, then there's technically one
[01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:08.590]  wall with two doors, but outside of that
[01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:10.630]  there's one door per wall
[01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:11.870]  and they're all at the top.
[01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:14.530]  But they're not all on the same
[01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:16.650]  wall. Gavin, I hate
[01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:18.410]  this. I'm gonna
[01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:20.390]  have to listen to this back at like .5
[01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:22.090]  speed. It's very simple.
[01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:24.470]  Gavin, it's very simple. All of
[01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:26.370]  the doors are at the top, but they're
[01:08:26.370 --> 01:08:28.470]  on different walls. Yes, and I
[01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:30.550]  have four walls. They're non-standard
[01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:32.290]  windows and one of them isn't a door.
[01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:34.410]  Yeah, well I've got one very
[01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:36.310]  standard window. One door not
[01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:38.310]  standard window, I'd say. I'd say it's not a standard
[01:08:38.310 --> 01:08:38.550]  window.
[01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:42.210]  I should draw the room that I
[01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:44.190]  thought he lived in before this
[01:08:44.190 --> 01:08:46.350]  explanation and then the room that
[01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:47.710]  he's convinced me he lives in now.
[01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:50.350]  They're very different rooms in my head. I can't wait to see these drawings.
[01:08:50.530 --> 01:08:52.310]  I feel like, once again, like the nose thing
[01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:54.390]  you guys said crazy instructions, or
[01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:56.390]  at least Gavin did, I
[01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:58.390]  feel it's very clear. I mean, based on the
[01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:00.530]  information I have, I'm going to draw a room that defies
[01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:02.210]  physics. Yeah, you're going to have
[01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:04.310]  fucking a ceiling full of doors.
[01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:06.390]  Sauce tower, also at the
[01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:08.410]  top. I feel like that's important. What's at the
[01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.250]  top? Sauce tower. The sauce
[01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:12.530]  pyramid that I've built. The sauce construction.
[01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:14.070]  Your entire fucking
[01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:15.570]  apartment is at the top.
[01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:17.230]  What's at the bottom?
[01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:20.270]  My bed. My bed and my
[01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:22.530]  Keurig. It's like a two-dimensional room.
[01:09:23.730 --> 01:09:24.630]  It's the opposite
[01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:26.490]  of interstellar. I got my bed
[01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:28.410]  and my Keurig. I got my end tables.
[01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:30.070]  My nightstands.
[01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:32.590]  It's not so stellar, is
[01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:33.130]  what this is.
[01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:36.730]  Do you sleep on a shelf on the wall at the top?
[01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:38.530]  How does it work? I sleep on a
[01:09:38.530 --> 01:09:39.530]  very comfortable bed.
[01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:42.090]  Surrounded by a thousand pillows
[01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:44.190]  and a keyboard. Bed at the bottom.
[01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:45.910]  Eric gets it.
[01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:48.210]  Oh yeah, it could be a Murphy bed.
[01:09:48.570 --> 01:09:49.570]  Does not fold out.
[01:09:50.110 --> 01:09:51.370]  It takes up a lot of room, though.
[01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:52.810]  It's a king-size bed. It's a big bed.
[01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:54.270]  So it's going to get up a lot of the space.
[01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:56.890]  No, it's just a diagram.
[01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.650]  I'm saying it's going to fill up a lot of space. It's not a big room.
[01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:01.470]  Bed takes up a lot of the room, is what you're saying.
[01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:03.770]  I'm saying it's a majority of my room is bed.
[01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:05.110]  Yeah, if you're going to measure it.
[01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:06.510]  Mostly bed.
[01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:09.210]  I'm going to get to work on this.
[01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:09.850]  Yeah.
[01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:13.170]  I'm going to probably forget
[01:10:13.170 --> 01:10:14.830]  and then do it ten minutes before next week.
[01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:15.590]  Can't wait.
[01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:18.330]  So...
[01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:19.330]  I'll get right on that
[01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:21.130]  next Thursday.
[01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:23.690]  Well, thanks for listening to this episode of F*** Face.
[01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:25.330]  Another one in the books. Can you believe
[01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:27.690]  that Andrew's room was like that? I drank that whole Budweiser.
[01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:29.730]  What a crazy episode. I can't wait to see
[01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:31.190]  the trailer that Gavin shoots
[01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:33.790]  for Geoff's bike stunts. Find out what happens
[01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:35.790]  next time on the next episode
[01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:37.390]  of F*** Face, episode 59.
[01:10:37.930 --> 01:10:38.990]  See you next time. Goodbye.
[01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:41.550]  Was the Budweiser this episode?
[01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:42.450]  That was ages ago.
[01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:43.530]  Oh my God.
[01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:45.570]  The way that it came in
[01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:47.690]  was like it was done in post.
[01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:50.150]  How many episodes in a row have we done
[01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:51.370]  this stupid soda thing now?
[01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:53.650]  Four.
[01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:55.610]  But we've done three now.
[01:10:55.690 --> 01:10:57.090]  Did we not do any last week?
[01:10:57.570 --> 01:11:00.270]  Geoff did one last week, didn't he? Or was that this one?
[01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:01.230]  No, that was this one.
[01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:03.670]  Oh no, yeah, you're right.
[01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:05.410]  There was one break.
[01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:08.490]  Alright, Eric. We'll see you later.
[01:11:09.730 --> 01:11:10.770]  What else do you guys want to talk about?
[01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:12.430]  Um...
