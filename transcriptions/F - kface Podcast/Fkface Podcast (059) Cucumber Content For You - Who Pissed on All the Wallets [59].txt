[00:33.380 --> 00:37.240]  Well, hello and welcome to episode 59 of F*** Face, according to Eric.
[00:37.660 --> 00:40.580]  I'm Geoff, Gavin and Andrew are alive as well.
[00:40.580 --> 00:42.020]  And I sent my salad to you, Eric.
[00:42.320 --> 00:43.060]  You're all of us?
[00:45.520 --> 00:47.620]  Well, I said are alive as well.
[00:47.680 --> 00:48.960]  Ah, OK. Oh, OK.
[00:49.100 --> 00:51.160]  It was all very fast. I missed it.
[00:51.240 --> 00:52.240]  Yeah, it was a very quick.
[00:52.540 --> 00:53.600]  I also missed it.
[00:53.760 --> 00:54.260]  I thought we were.
[00:54.360 --> 00:56.240]  It's like a being John Malkovich situation.
[00:56.380 --> 00:57.300]  I thought we were in your head.
[00:57.680 --> 01:01.340]  For once, I was actually early because I had to come back in
[01:01.340 --> 01:04.060]  and consult Andrew about the the room layout.
[01:04.400 --> 01:06.840]  I had a lot of questions about the room layout
[01:06.840 --> 01:08.460]  and I wanted to consult Andrew,
[01:08.460 --> 01:11.900]  but I decided that I would just go with the information.
[01:11.900 --> 01:13.400]  He texted us two days ago.
[01:13.740 --> 01:14.180]  That was the thing.
[01:14.280 --> 01:16.200]  I couldn't remember where I saw that.
[01:16.340 --> 01:18.980]  Oh, yeah, he was in Slack and I came in.
[01:19.020 --> 01:19.860]  I was like, where's that info?
[01:19.900 --> 01:20.500]  And he was like in Slack.
[01:20.620 --> 01:21.460]  And then I had other questions,
[01:21.560 --> 01:24.240]  but I felt like unless you were going to receive the same info,
[01:24.620 --> 01:26.440]  it wouldn't be worth me asking anything.
[01:26.540 --> 01:28.440]  So I just stuck with the information that we're both given.
[01:28.620 --> 01:33.380]  I offered to forward all the answers to Geoff, but still no questions.
[01:33.480 --> 01:35.700]  So I'm excited to see see the layout that you've.
[01:35.820 --> 01:37.840]  Yeah, I put a lot of effort into it.
[01:37.840 --> 01:38.880]  I think you guys will like it.
[01:39.160 --> 01:42.300]  Let me also say because I very I found out,
[01:42.460 --> 01:46.140]  you know that I made it a funny joke to Gavin that our podcast wasn't doing well.
[01:46.200 --> 01:48.200]  And then he thought it wasn't doing well for years and years and years.
[01:48.800 --> 01:51.640]  And well, the podcast is barely a year old, so not quite that long.
[01:52.540 --> 01:54.740]  But I just to give you some good news,
[01:54.780 --> 01:59.060]  Gavin, I got an email the other day that said last week's episode,
[01:59.220 --> 02:01.560]  which was well, this is 59 recording.
[02:01.580 --> 02:07.260]  I think last week's episode is 57 that we released is on track to be our best performing episode ever.
[02:07.260 --> 02:08.960]  Wow, what happened?
[02:09.060 --> 02:10.920]  That was the cucumbers, cucumbers.
[02:11.380 --> 02:12.760]  It was your wasps.
[02:12.820 --> 02:14.460]  I think the orgies, the wasps.
[02:14.500 --> 02:14.680]  Yeah.
[02:15.780 --> 02:18.080]  So no, it was it was after the wasps.
[02:18.140 --> 02:23.900]  Yeah. So cucumbers and orgies is apparently a winning combination.
[02:23.900 --> 02:26.240]  I see. Congratulations.
[02:26.320 --> 02:33.240]  Things are trending up. If our most recent episode is on track to be our best performing episode,
[02:33.240 --> 02:38.280]  then that can only mean that the next episode will probably be like that.
[02:38.940 --> 02:41.300]  I feel it already is. We already recorded that one.
[02:41.520 --> 02:45.000]  That one's already guaranteed. It's in the can. It's disappointing.
[02:45.160 --> 02:47.360]  Yeah. Well, that's done. It's just put pressure on this one, I think.
[02:47.460 --> 02:55.700]  Yeah. Yeah. Also, hey, if anybody's got like we need to hit the cucumber content and the homeless orgy content hard.
[02:56.120 --> 02:58.760]  So Andrew, take it away with your next orgy story. Go.
[02:59.980 --> 03:01.680]  Well, I don't have one of those, but I do.
[03:01.680 --> 03:07.340]  I got some cucumber content for you this week, Geoff, that you orchestrated.
[03:07.440 --> 03:10.480]  I feel like the last thing we do on this show is chase treads.
[03:10.940 --> 03:13.820]  Like, yeah, I will say, you know, we're actually doing it.
[03:14.240 --> 03:18.640]  We're going to pause for one second. You're crediting orgies. You're crediting cucumbers.
[03:18.840 --> 03:24.020]  I think the real star of this is fucking honey mustard. Honey mustard has been a constant.
[03:24.600 --> 03:28.360]  It's rocketing to the moon. Honey mustard is the way to go.
[03:28.360 --> 03:35.480]  If we could get a spreadsheet of all the views on honey mustard mentioned episodes and see if they trend higher, then that's the future, I think.
[03:35.720 --> 03:45.780]  If we don't make an official like Raymond Saumur honey mustard and release and sell it in stores, we are not doing our jobs properly.
[03:46.240 --> 03:50.460]  I agree. I mean, isn't that where it all began? Was Andrew wanted to be behind some honey mustard ones?
[03:50.460 --> 03:54.640]  Yeah, it was. Yeah. Well, no, it was. What was it? We're talking about condiments.
[03:54.660 --> 03:55.580]  You just didn't want to make it.
[03:55.580 --> 04:00.520]  No, I think it was salad cream. It went back to the original salad cream conversation of like, what's the best condiment?
[04:00.900 --> 04:04.940]  And that was the intro to honey mustard. And that was the origin story.
[04:05.060 --> 04:08.440]  And that was the origin. Yeah, that's how it was created.
[04:08.820 --> 04:12.280]  So I we should this was a this was an interesting start to a podcast.
[04:12.500 --> 04:17.460]  So let's cover what we're going to cover today. Well, Andrew, you've got some cucumber content.
[04:18.840 --> 04:26.800]  Well, I'm excited about that. We have the reveal of our Andrew's bedroom drawings.
[04:27.240 --> 04:30.960]  I don't know how you feel about yours, Gavin, but I am very jazzed about mine.
[04:31.280 --> 04:34.200]  I worked hard on it. I put probably 25 minutes into it.
[04:34.440 --> 04:38.100]  Dude, I put I got I was doing it. Well, I'll just show it to you.
[04:38.340 --> 04:41.520]  I worked hard on it as well, and I was unhappy with my drawings.
[04:41.520 --> 04:43.280]  So I decided to take it in a different direction.
[04:43.280 --> 04:48.460]  Eric said 25 minutes is too long. 25 minutes is too long.
[04:48.560 --> 04:53.440]  Well, how long would you have spent on it, Eric? Maybe two and a half minutes.
[04:53.780 --> 04:56.240]  You just it sounds like it sounds like you have time.
[04:56.440 --> 04:59.860]  So why don't you whip one up? Oh, I didn't get I wasn't unfortunately,
[05:00.260 --> 05:03.400]  I wasn't part of the text conversation with all I could give you that.
[05:03.700 --> 05:06.560]  I can give you that right now. It's one sentence, dickhead.
[05:07.040 --> 05:09.380]  It's not a lot. I can probably go by memory.
[05:10.500 --> 05:15.460]  Three doors all at the top, bed at the bottom, two windows,
[05:16.600 --> 05:22.620]  one hole where a door should be. Four walls, three doors all at the top.
[05:22.760 --> 05:24.600]  No wall has multiple doors on it.
[05:24.640 --> 05:28.060]  But one has two doorways, two windows, bed at the back.
[05:28.480 --> 05:31.120]  I spent I spent at least 45 minutes on it.
[05:31.560 --> 05:35.180]  Started and threw away and restarted a bunch. On top of that,
[05:35.180 --> 05:40.120]  we have all designed I found some online salad generator that by the way,
[05:40.180 --> 05:42.000]  there are a lot of online salad generators,
[05:42.520 --> 05:48.740]  but they're all related to fucking to like stores like Mad Greens or Wendy's or whatever.
[05:48.940 --> 05:50.760]  I don't want to push a corporate giant.
[05:51.080 --> 05:53.520]  So I found one that just appears to be like some healthy site
[05:54.280 --> 05:57.780]  and I'm not crazy about the ingredients. First of all,
[05:58.440 --> 06:01.280]  their idea of salad dressing is ludicrous.
[06:01.460 --> 06:05.100]  There's zero salad dressing listed on the salad dressing options.
[06:05.100 --> 06:08.380]  The closest thing they had was lime juice or salsa,
[06:09.000 --> 06:11.000]  but the ingredients for salad are there.
[06:11.260 --> 06:13.800]  So we've all and by all I mean Gavin, Geoff,
[06:13.980 --> 06:19.040]  Andrew, and I believe Nick have created our salads and sent them to Eric.
[06:19.200 --> 06:22.240]  What we're going to do here is Eric's going to read them blind
[06:22.240 --> 06:25.460]  and then we're going to all try to guess who made each salad.
[06:25.800 --> 06:27.960]  Then eventually down the road in person,
[06:28.120 --> 06:31.220]  I assume we will make those salads and then share them with each other
[06:31.220 --> 06:33.440]  and then determine which one is the best tasting.
[06:33.440 --> 06:37.500]  Now, I'm not sure if I did mine right, but I didn't try and be funny at all.
[06:37.600 --> 06:39.820]  I just thought which salad would I really like to eat?
[06:39.900 --> 06:40.980]  Is that the right way to go about it?
[06:41.060 --> 06:44.940]  Yes, I made the salad out of those ingredients that would taste the best to me.
[06:45.480 --> 06:48.300]  I made a... I went beyond that.
[06:48.400 --> 06:51.380]  I think I made an iconic salad personally.
[06:52.160 --> 06:59.180]  I knew this was going to happen where Geoff had an idea that was simple
[06:59.180 --> 07:03.720]  and then Andrew started sending me stuff that had subtext
[07:03.720 --> 07:08.020]  and I went, this is going to be the whole episode.
[07:08.380 --> 07:09.180]  I took notes.
[07:09.420 --> 07:14.380]  I saw a comment from one of the many comment leavers that listened to the show
[07:14.380 --> 07:17.740]  and someone I think nailed it with Andrew and his salad is that
[07:17.740 --> 07:21.500]  Andrew has always been trying to make a salad that enhances the cream
[07:21.500 --> 07:23.980]  when you just want the cream to enhance the salad.
[07:24.520 --> 07:26.400]  And that's exactly what he's done at every point.
[07:26.400 --> 07:30.240]  He's trying to make the ultimate salad to go with his cream.
[07:31.040 --> 07:31.380]  Well, okay.
[07:31.460 --> 07:34.720]  That was the first attempt was I wanted to make the ultimate a salad,
[07:34.860 --> 07:40.460]  a canvas fitting for the paint that is salad cream and you guys rejected that.
[07:40.800 --> 07:44.800]  So then the second time I just got a regulation salad and had it a second.
[07:44.920 --> 07:45.760]  I don't know what you wanted.
[07:46.480 --> 07:47.420]  I tried both things.
[07:47.520 --> 07:49.960]  I mean, obviously I can't do it the first time twice.
[07:50.340 --> 07:51.940]  I love stuff that's regulation.
[07:52.440 --> 07:53.500]  It's a regulation salad.
[07:53.620 --> 07:54.520]  What other regulation?
[07:54.520 --> 07:56.040]  It's got to be regulation.
[07:56.040 --> 07:57.420]  It's got to be standard regulation.
[07:57.600 --> 07:58.120]  It has to be.
[07:58.280 --> 07:59.160]  Otherwise there's no point.
[07:59.780 --> 08:01.540]  It's all like regulations and standards.
[08:01.920 --> 08:04.420]  We got the standard ears, the standard windows, the regulation salad.
[08:04.680 --> 08:06.260]  There's like, there's lots of rules.
[08:06.460 --> 08:09.740]  You can almost make some sort of like legal document around this.
[08:09.800 --> 08:12.140]  Yeah, we can cut the rules according to f*** face.
[08:12.760 --> 08:15.300]  Yeah, some comment leavers should make that.
[08:15.660 --> 08:16.880]  I asked questions about the salad.
[08:16.960 --> 08:19.420]  I'm the only one, Geoff, you presented this idea and to be clear,
[08:19.840 --> 08:21.400]  this is my cucumber content.
[08:21.960 --> 08:24.000]  I assume that you saw the cucumber numbers
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.020]  and were like, we need to introduce vegetables to this show in some way.
[08:27.180 --> 08:29.720]  That was my connection of that's why we're making salads.
[08:30.300 --> 08:31.240]  I sent this to you.
[08:31.300 --> 08:32.800]  I was just thinking about it.
[08:32.880 --> 08:35.120]  I was thinking about it and I thought like, oh, this is a funny idea.
[08:35.220 --> 08:37.100]  And then I sent it. Here's how my brain works.
[08:37.180 --> 08:42.860]  I sent it in the Slack and then you guys all responded kind of quickly and like positively
[08:42.860 --> 08:48.500]  and then in a way that thought, oh no, I bet this is an idea that we had months
[08:48.500 --> 08:52.340]  and months ago that we already submitted to the Slack and I forgot about
[08:52.340 --> 08:55.460]  and now I'm trying to claim it as my idea and this is probably an old idea
[08:55.460 --> 08:57.580]  and at some point they're going to bring it up and be like,
[08:57.720 --> 08:59.140]  dickhead, you stole this six months ago.
[08:59.480 --> 09:00.540]  We already did this or something.
[09:00.840 --> 09:03.940]  And so I've been paranoid ever since I submit and which reminds me
[09:03.940 --> 09:06.840]  why I'm paranoid sometimes to submit ideas to this show
[09:06.840 --> 09:10.280]  because I'm scared that I'm stealing them from the show from the past
[09:10.280 --> 09:11.940]  and you guys are going to make fun of me for it.
[09:12.220 --> 09:14.460]  I feel like that was a much bigger problem when you were drunk,
[09:14.700 --> 09:16.340]  where we would have a conversation.
[09:16.520 --> 09:18.120]  I'd be like, oh, what if we did this?
[09:18.160 --> 09:21.140]  And then like a month later, you'd be like, shit, let's do this
[09:21.140 --> 09:22.040]  and we would end up doing it.
[09:22.100 --> 09:27.440]  But I'd be like, I'm pretty sure we had this idea a month ago.
[09:28.120 --> 09:31.900]  I also, I think we could talk about the break show.
[09:32.300 --> 09:36.920]  Yeah, we could talk about, I came up with some minor bathroom insights
[09:36.920 --> 09:41.280]  that I could cover. We recently, Gavin and I had a hangout
[09:41.280 --> 09:45.600]  and in that period there was, we had a moment in the bathroom
[09:45.600 --> 09:52.140]  we could talk about. And then, unfortunately, because Gavin and I
[09:52.140 --> 09:55.860]  hung out on Sunday, it rained every day after that.
[09:55.960 --> 10:00.180]  We had plans to film the extreme bicycle stunt on Wednesday
[10:00.980 --> 10:02.740]  and I rode out Wednesday morning.
[10:02.760 --> 10:05.620]  I got up at like 7 in the morning on Wednesday and rode my bike out
[10:05.620 --> 10:07.700]  there to check out the scene, to practice and stuff.
[10:08.140 --> 10:13.240]  And it was still, it's still, at that point, it was still a drainage
[10:13.240 --> 10:14.920]  ditch, you know, it's a drainage ditch.
[10:14.920 --> 10:20.480]  So it was still draining and it's not an aqua, it's not an aqua trick.
[10:20.700 --> 10:24.080]  So we were unable to record it, which really sucks because we're
[10:24.080 --> 10:25.280]  recording these episodes back-to-back.
[10:25.600 --> 10:27.740]  So I think in the first episode, we said we were going to do this
[10:27.740 --> 10:30.860]  and now it'll be three episodes later and we still haven't done it.
[10:31.100 --> 10:32.600]  But, unfortunately.
[10:33.220 --> 10:34.260]  There's so much going on.
[10:34.380 --> 10:37.160]  This is, this episode feels like a table of contents where it's like,
[10:37.300 --> 10:40.760]  which direction, it could almost be a choose your own podcast direction.
[10:41.020 --> 10:42.280]  We're recording two, right?
[10:42.320 --> 10:43.760]  We're going to record this one and the one right after it.
[10:43.760 --> 10:46.540]  So whatever we don't choose, we'll choose the next episode.
[10:46.680 --> 10:49.560]  I assume Gavin and Andrew, you guys have a ton of shit, too.
[10:49.700 --> 10:50.820]  Outside of Cucumber content.
[10:51.180 --> 10:54.420]  I will say that that answered one of my main questions going into
[10:54.420 --> 10:56.100]  this is if you film the bike trick.
[10:56.200 --> 11:00.580]  I texted Gavin, I think on Saturday, that it was the highlight of
[11:00.580 --> 11:03.280]  my weekend knowing that you may be doing this at any moment and
[11:03.280 --> 11:04.680]  just hoping that it came together.
[11:04.880 --> 11:07.720]  Like anytime I was doing anything, I could be making lunch and in
[11:07.720 --> 11:10.240]  my head, I was like, Geoff could be filming a bike trick.
[11:10.460 --> 11:12.400]  He could be trying to do a BMX stunt.
[11:12.400 --> 11:15.840]  The funny thing about that is the original plan was to do it on
[11:15.840 --> 11:19.340]  the weekend on Saturday, but then I saw Gavin all day Friday at
[11:19.340 --> 11:22.300]  the break show and then I knew we were hanging out Sunday because
[11:22.300 --> 11:23.220]  we're going to go to the movies.
[11:23.500 --> 11:25.680]  So I just didn't think about Saturday. Three days in a row would
[11:25.680 --> 11:28.200]  have been excessive and I completely forgot about it.
[11:28.220 --> 11:30.140]  And he never texted me to say, hey, are we going to film this
[11:30.140 --> 11:31.740]  thing? And so I never texted him.
[11:32.040 --> 11:33.340]  We probably could have done it Saturday.
[11:33.940 --> 11:36.440]  Yeah, we made the mistake of hanging out first and now we have
[11:36.440 --> 11:39.260]  to wait out the probably the next ten days of rain.
[11:39.260 --> 11:42.480]  Yeah, so that leads to my second question.
[11:42.720 --> 11:44.060]  How is the Dbox family?
[11:44.160 --> 11:45.020]  Did you guys come together?
[11:45.080 --> 11:45.820]  Was it a good time?
[11:45.880 --> 11:47.420]  That was the other thing that got me excited.
[11:47.640 --> 11:50.020]  So it was even better than Dbox.
[11:50.540 --> 11:52.560]  It was really 4DX.
[11:53.040 --> 11:54.560]  Eric, what are your thoughts on it?
[11:54.740 --> 11:55.660]  What is 4DX?
[11:55.840 --> 12:00.060]  I never thought that I would be a guy who would watch a movie
[12:00.060 --> 12:05.400]  that had water sprayed at you and smoke shot at the screen and
[12:05.400 --> 12:09.600]  the seat shaking the whole time and walk out and go, that was
[12:09.600 --> 12:14.560]  the best thing I've ever seen. Cinema be damned.
[12:14.960 --> 12:17.200]  They just made it a Universal Studios Red.
[12:17.820 --> 12:22.000]  What's funny is that you walk in and it looks like someone's
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.520]  like screwed an entire janitor's closet onto the walls up at
[12:25.520 --> 12:25.840]  the top.
[12:25.940 --> 12:27.280]  There's like fans.
[12:27.520 --> 12:30.400]  There's all these boxes and like pipes and lights and stuff.
[12:30.440 --> 12:31.600]  It looks like an absolute mess.
[12:32.140 --> 12:33.740]  And that's all the tools for the movie.
[12:33.800 --> 12:34.760]  And then the lights go down.
[12:34.760 --> 12:38.560]  There's smoke all over the movie, but it kind of doesn't work
[12:38.560 --> 12:41.520]  because it's immensely distracting to see all the movie covered
[12:41.520 --> 12:43.400]  up. And also it's rear projected.
[12:43.580 --> 12:47.120]  So you're seeing the movie like all messed up on top of the smoke.
[12:47.860 --> 12:48.900]  There's flashes.
[12:49.340 --> 12:51.100]  The seats are swinging all around.
[12:51.420 --> 12:52.920]  There's water in your face.
[12:53.120 --> 12:53.380]  It ruled.
[12:53.640 --> 12:56.380]  There's a button to turn water on and off.
[12:57.900 --> 13:02.700]  If we were like sort of in, you know, like the 7th or 8th
[13:02.700 --> 13:06.040]  row. So we were like past sort of like the flat four rows in
[13:06.040 --> 13:13.060]  the front. Those rows, when there was smoke, could not see a thing.
[13:13.620 --> 13:17.680]  They were waving their arms to move the smoke so they can continue
[13:17.680 --> 13:20.900]  watching a movie. And it was futile.
[13:22.940 --> 13:26.320]  It was, it creates such a rowdy environment.
[13:26.520 --> 13:29.460]  Like everyone in there was just screaming at the top of their
[13:29.460 --> 13:32.440]  lungs. Like stuff would happen and Eric would be like,
[13:32.480 --> 13:36.240]  WHY IS IT GOING ON at the top of his lungs? And it was just
[13:36.240 --> 13:38.140]  perfectly fine.
[13:38.260 --> 13:41.360]  Like it was the right place and the right people to see that movie
[13:41.360 --> 13:45.100]  with. It was phenomenal. Then I saw the movie again without any of
[13:45.100 --> 13:47.540]  that and it was a bit quiet in there.
[13:47.980 --> 13:49.080]  Let me say something.
[13:49.500 --> 13:51.640]  I saw the movie with you on Sunday.
[13:51.760 --> 13:54.560]  I didn't get to experience the D-Box trip.
[13:54.940 --> 13:58.780]  However, I did get to see something that I think might be as good
[13:58.780 --> 14:03.000]  as that. And that is when the break show was over, Tim G rolled
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.820]  to pick you guys up right outside to take you to the movie.
[14:05.840 --> 14:10.460]  And I got to see Tim G roll up in a Subaru Outback with cool
[14:10.460 --> 14:12.500]  guy sunglasses and then get out and go,
[14:12.580 --> 14:15.180]  Oh, hold on a second. And then get out and take car seats out
[14:15.180 --> 14:17.860]  of the back to make room for you guys so that you can peel out
[14:17.860 --> 14:20.660]  to go to your super cool movie together. And that in itself,
[14:20.660 --> 14:23.380]  I just stopped and I watched that until you guys left and then
[14:23.380 --> 14:25.500]  I went about my business. That was better than the D-Box.
[14:25.600 --> 14:26.260]  I'm pretty sure.
[14:26.260 --> 14:29.520]  I wish you could have come because it's, unfortunately, the
[14:29.520 --> 14:33.160]  seats that move are in like rows of four. You'd like buy a four
[14:33.160 --> 14:37.140]  block and we had it was like full. But then we went and got
[14:37.140 --> 14:38.960]  Coronas before we went and saw the movie.
[14:39.420 --> 14:40.940]  What a day, what an experience.
[14:41.460 --> 14:45.020]  It was really, I had a great time and Tim G's on a kick right
[14:45.020 --> 14:48.060]  now where we were even commenting on it, where we just went,
[14:48.240 --> 14:50.940]  Wow, man, you really leaned into like the dad slash off-duty
[14:50.940 --> 14:56.240]  cop look. He's got a full-on mustache, a tie-dye
[14:56.240 --> 15:01.880]  shirt that says gazpacho season, some shorts, New Balance
[15:01.880 --> 15:06.260]  shoes, and man, that's a big ol' mustache. Like, it's really,
[15:06.380 --> 15:09.300]  he's got it. He's, boy, it's a big ol' mustache. It's something.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.260]  And Gavin was, and it was Gavin's laundry day.
[15:12.340 --> 15:14.100]  So he was dressed like a cool guy as well.
[15:14.260 --> 15:17.500]  It was awesome. You had a real, and Andrew had a real problem
[15:17.500 --> 15:20.400]  with my shorts during the last break shift. It's not you.
[15:20.480 --> 15:21.120]  They're not you, man.
[15:21.200 --> 15:24.100]  Yeah, you wear salmon colored button-up shorts.
[15:24.200 --> 15:24.780]  That's all you own.
[15:24.820 --> 15:25.500]  That's all you should own.
[15:25.500 --> 15:27.620]  Look, sometimes I gotta do laundry.
[15:27.920 --> 15:30.720]  All right? Sometimes I gotta wear shorts that I wear on a treadmill
[15:30.720 --> 15:34.440]  or on a walk. I understand. Just don't do it in public again.
[15:34.880 --> 15:39.260]  No, it makes sense. It was weird seeing you in active shorts.
[15:39.500 --> 15:41.600]  It was weird seeing you in active shorts.
[15:41.900 --> 15:44.380]  It really was. I don't know why.
[15:44.460 --> 15:45.020]  I don't know why.
[15:45.080 --> 15:45.820]  You're an active dude.
[15:46.020 --> 15:48.660]  I lived with you for off and on for years and years and years.
[15:48.800 --> 15:52.480]  I must have seen you in like basketball shorts before.
[15:52.940 --> 15:54.140]  You might not have.
[15:54.140 --> 15:55.480]  I just can't remember it.
[15:55.560 --> 15:56.640]  And it was so shocking.
[15:57.000 --> 15:57.940]  It was so out of character.
[15:58.720 --> 16:02.200]  I can't even imagine Gavin shooting a basketball. Like that
[16:02.200 --> 16:04.580]  visual in my mind is just very weird to me.
[16:04.780 --> 16:08.100]  I feel like I let you guys down by showing up in these shorts.
[16:09.120 --> 16:10.640]  Here's the thing with Gavin in sports.
[16:10.880 --> 16:13.780]  He's probably great at British sports, but we got to keep him
[16:13.780 --> 16:14.820]  away from American sports.
[16:14.900 --> 16:17.120]  I'm sure you've heard the story of the very first time he
[16:17.120 --> 16:20.720]  threw a baseball to my daughter and hit her in the face and
[16:20.720 --> 16:21.300]  split her lip.
[16:21.300 --> 16:23.000]  So, okay.
[16:23.540 --> 16:25.960]  Is that Gavin's fault or is that your daughter's fault?
[16:25.960 --> 16:29.460]  Well, she was like five or six and he chucked it at her like
[16:29.460 --> 16:34.380]  he was Nolan Ryan. Overhand, as a wind-up.
[16:34.640 --> 16:36.360]  I was in the tutorial level.
[16:36.540 --> 16:37.780]  I was receiving the instructions.
[16:38.040 --> 16:39.060]  I'm like, how do people pitch?
[16:39.080 --> 16:41.640]  They just throw it straight at the person with the glove or
[16:41.640 --> 16:43.320]  the bat and you were like, yeah, just do it like this.
[16:43.460 --> 16:46.740]  I did it and I just hit a five-year-old girl's skull and
[16:46.740 --> 16:48.480]  I don't think I've ever thrown one since.
[16:48.680 --> 16:50.440]  You threw it at her skull.
[16:51.300 --> 16:52.620]  Well, that's where the glove was.
[16:54.320 --> 16:58.240]  Luckily, she lived and she's mostly fine.
[16:58.540 --> 17:01.220]  And I think almost forgiven me for it.
[17:01.560 --> 17:03.380]  Yeah, I think she's forgiven you at this point.
[17:04.380 --> 17:07.340]  I don't know that she's forgiven Andrew yet for not
[17:07.340 --> 17:09.140]  watching that final Leprechaun movie with her though.
[17:09.420 --> 17:09.980]  It's not my fault.
[17:10.240 --> 17:11.080]  I wanted to watch it.
[17:11.280 --> 17:13.400]  She told me one night.
[17:13.520 --> 17:14.900]  She was like, hey, I'm gonna do you mind?
[17:14.940 --> 17:16.900]  I'm gonna watch Leprechaun because we were gonna watch
[17:16.900 --> 17:17.460]  Survivor or something.
[17:17.540 --> 17:19.040]  She's like, I'm gonna watch that final Leprechaun movie
[17:19.040 --> 17:21.120]  with Andrew and I was like, okay, glad you guys are finally
[17:21.120 --> 17:22.000]  doing it. She goes, yeah, me too.
[17:22.040 --> 17:22.540]  I'm super excited.
[17:22.660 --> 17:23.840]  And then later I checked on it.
[17:23.880 --> 17:25.220]  I was like, hey, I thought you're gonna watch that movie
[17:25.220 --> 17:27.040]  with Andrew and she goes, oh, he canceled.
[17:27.400 --> 17:29.140]  He's too busy getting ready for F*** Face.
[17:29.600 --> 17:31.760]  And I was like, oh, oh, yikes.
[17:32.220 --> 17:33.820]  No, what was what day was that?
[17:34.140 --> 17:35.720]  There was there are multiple attempts.
[17:35.860 --> 17:38.640]  I reached out one day that she didn't see the message.
[17:38.820 --> 17:39.800]  It's we've gone back and forth.
[17:39.860 --> 17:40.820]  We'll eventually get there.
[17:40.940 --> 17:42.000]  I'd love to watch it.
[17:42.020 --> 17:42.880]  I'm excited about it.
[17:43.040 --> 17:44.540]  I just want you both to know that you've disappointed
[17:44.540 --> 17:45.560]  my daughter in different ways.
[17:45.840 --> 17:46.300]  That's great.
[17:46.300 --> 17:48.440]  I feel like whenever I hear about F*** Face through
[17:48.440 --> 17:50.920]  Millie, it's always about the inconvenience that is
[17:50.920 --> 17:53.360]  the recording of F*** Face and how it's getting in the way
[17:53.360 --> 17:54.540]  and it's loud.
[17:54.980 --> 17:56.320]  It is very inconvenient.
[17:56.500 --> 17:59.320]  Emily, actually, she was telling me the other day.
[17:59.360 --> 18:01.640]  She was like, you guys need to do a short at Rooster Teeth.
[18:01.960 --> 18:04.580]  That's just all of the girlfriends and spouses and kids
[18:04.580 --> 18:07.880]  that are like dealing with fridge repairmen while they
[18:07.880 --> 18:09.680]  hear while in another room.
[18:09.780 --> 18:13.040]  They hear an adult man screaming, fuck my anus or whatever,
[18:13.240 --> 18:16.460]  you know, and she's like, it's like it could just cut to
[18:16.460 --> 18:18.340]  all the different like all the different spouses going.
[18:19.520 --> 18:22.420]  Well, while we're on, we were still on F9 and stuff and
[18:22.420 --> 18:24.860]  that that would lead us to our bathroom incident.
[18:24.860 --> 18:25.800]  Geoff, what was going on?
[18:25.980 --> 18:29.700]  Well, you and I, I assume in a similar fashion, I had to
[18:29.700 --> 18:31.320]  pee one second into the movie.
[18:31.540 --> 18:35.760]  I have a real problem with, I just hate getting up in a
[18:35.760 --> 18:38.500]  cinema and leaving the movie that I paid to watch, because
[18:38.500 --> 18:39.600]  you missed big chunks of it.
[18:39.660 --> 18:41.960]  So I've always been one to hold it in, but it's really bad
[18:41.960 --> 18:42.240]  for you.
[18:42.440 --> 18:46.440]  Not only that, but I felt an extra pressure because we went
[18:47.400 --> 18:52.660]  Alfredo, who works at a Chima Hunter with us, he and Jackie,
[18:52.880 --> 18:57.020]  his girlfriend, they rented out a theater to watch Fast 9.
[18:57.560 --> 19:00.600]  And so the only people in the theater were our friends and
[19:00.600 --> 19:02.840]  people that we know, and there's maybe 20 of us.
[19:02.940 --> 19:05.360]  So I felt like an extra pressure, like I'm not going to
[19:05.360 --> 19:07.300]  be the, and nobody was getting up to go to the bathroom.
[19:07.380 --> 19:09.820]  I'm not going to be the only one to do it, the first one.
[19:10.280 --> 19:13.400]  And so I just held it in the entire, by the way, that is
[19:13.400 --> 19:17.440]  a long movie, apparently. Way longer when you're up to
[19:17.440 --> 19:18.200]  your eyeballs in urine.
[19:18.560 --> 19:19.540]  It's like two and a half hours.
[19:19.840 --> 19:21.220]  I assumed Gavin did the same thing.
[19:21.300 --> 19:24.400]  So the second the credits rolled, I was, Speedy Gonzalo
[19:24.400 --> 19:25.180]  was out of the chair.
[19:25.260 --> 19:29.080]  There was like a puff of smoke and I look around and Gavin's
[19:29.080 --> 19:30.100]  doing the same thing, running.
[19:30.300 --> 19:31.780]  So I was like, well, I can't let him beat me to the bathroom.
[19:32.060 --> 19:34.600]  So it was a foot race and then we got there and we were the
[19:34.600 --> 19:35.720]  only two people in the bathroom.
[19:35.820 --> 19:38.900]  There was this giant row of like 20 urinals.
[19:39.300 --> 19:42.380]  Well, first I was doing that like speed hobble, where you
[19:42.380 --> 19:44.900]  don't want to like run because your bladder will pop, but
[19:44.900 --> 19:46.280]  you're kind of like hunched and running.
[19:46.520 --> 19:50.000]  But then Geoff hid behind the wall and he was trying to jump
[19:50.000 --> 19:50.480]  out of me.
[19:50.920 --> 19:51.400]  Oh, I forgot about that.
[19:51.960 --> 19:54.780]  Were you trying to like poke me or like shove a finger up my
[19:54.780 --> 19:55.160]  ass or something?
[19:55.380 --> 19:57.100]  I was trying to scare the pee out of you.
[19:57.240 --> 20:00.700]  Yeah, you jumped at me and I was just like, I really had to
[20:00.700 --> 20:01.000]  hold it.
[20:01.020 --> 20:02.540]  I was like, I've got pee so bad.
[20:02.580 --> 20:03.480]  And then you were like, me too.
[20:03.540 --> 20:06.200]  And we just sort of, we stopped messing with each other.
[20:06.340 --> 20:08.940]  We were both on the same page and we both ran to the bathroom.
[20:09.220 --> 20:11.860]  And then so we went to opposite ends and we started peeing
[20:11.860 --> 20:15.440]  and I didn't intend it to be this, but it turned into a race
[20:15.440 --> 20:18.620]  to see who had more pee in them and who could pee longer.
[20:19.300 --> 20:22.640]  And I don't know about you, but that was probably in my top
[20:22.640 --> 20:25.220]  15 longest pees in my life.
[20:25.360 --> 20:26.660]  It was probably in my top three.
[20:26.980 --> 20:30.140]  I don't think I've pissed that long in maybe a decade.
[20:30.720 --> 20:33.480]  I, at one point, I couldn't stop.
[20:34.200 --> 20:37.740]  Like I was like, I was looking at my dick and I was like, is
[20:37.740 --> 20:38.380]  this a joke?
[20:38.740 --> 20:42.840]  Like there can't be this much pee and it's still going and
[20:42.840 --> 20:44.160]  it's a decent stream too.
[20:44.420 --> 20:46.440]  And I'm looking at Gavin and he's still going and I'm thinking
[20:46.440 --> 20:47.960]  like, okay, well at least it's not weird.
[20:48.120 --> 20:51.020]  But then at some point Gavin stopped and I kept going and
[20:51.020 --> 20:52.080]  I was starting to get a little scared.
[20:52.420 --> 20:55.460]  Like, like, what do you do if you never stop pee, right?
[20:55.520 --> 20:58.060]  Like I started to think like, do I call, do I have Gavin
[20:58.060 --> 21:00.120]  call a doctor and get advice?
[21:00.160 --> 21:03.800]  Like, do I like, we like hook some sort of a bucket to the
[21:03.800 --> 21:05.360]  end of my dick so that I can move around?
[21:05.420 --> 21:06.580]  I can walk and still pee?
[21:06.580 --> 21:10.960]  It was so much unspoken when, when you're peeing, like when
[21:10.960 --> 21:13.540]  two people start peeing at the same time, it's just a normal
[21:13.540 --> 21:13.800]  piss.
[21:13.900 --> 21:17.860]  It's a normal experience until both people subconsciously
[21:17.860 --> 21:20.620]  realized that these pisses have been going on a really long
[21:20.620 --> 21:23.400]  time. And I had that realization when I was about halfway
[21:23.400 --> 21:23.780]  through.
[21:24.100 --> 21:26.740]  I still had about half of it left in the tank. At one point
[21:27.320 --> 21:29.460]  we were, we kind of both had that realization at the same
[21:29.460 --> 21:31.740]  time and I just looked over to the other end of the bathroom
[21:31.740 --> 21:36.180]  and I could see Geoff's little head as we're both just pissing
[21:36.180 --> 21:38.660]  It was so long, we were just both laughing while we were pissing.
[21:38.940 --> 21:42.340]  It was such a weird moment, but I loved it. It was so great.
[21:42.500 --> 21:47.380]  It was a really weird, like, funny friendship, wholesome
[21:47.380 --> 21:50.740]  bonding friendship moment. And all the whole time I was
[21:50.740 --> 21:53.360]  giggling like a fucking nine-year-old. All I can think of
[21:53.360 --> 21:55.780]  is this is gonna be so weird if somebody walks into the
[21:55.780 --> 21:59.000]  bathroom and Gavin and I are just giggling like children
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.020]  while we pee on the opposite sides of the bathroom from
[22:02.020 --> 22:04.360]  each other. And luckily we had the bathroom to ourselves
[22:04.360 --> 22:05.860]  for a good six or seven minutes.
[22:05.860 --> 22:10.020]  Nobody ever came in. It was great. The moment wasn't spoiled.
[22:10.320 --> 22:11.460]  Everyone was talking about the movie.
[22:11.580 --> 22:14.340]  They were like wrapping up the conversation so we hadn't even been there.
[22:17.560 --> 22:19.140]  People were saying their goodbyes.
[22:20.060 --> 22:21.400]  Hey, what did everybody think of the movie?
[22:22.260 --> 22:24.480]  I left the bathroom almost out of breath.
[22:24.800 --> 22:29.260]  It was really hard work.
[22:31.780 --> 22:35.420]  What a fast, like, I'm trying to think like what our longest
[22:35.420 --> 22:37.440]  recorded pisses in human history.
[22:37.660 --> 22:39.100]  I'm just like even like film history.
[22:39.200 --> 22:40.280]  I'm thinking Austin Powers.
[22:40.860 --> 22:42.240]  There's that extended piss sequence.
[22:42.420 --> 22:43.660]  Yeah, he has some breaks though.
[22:44.060 --> 22:47.240]  There's that Adam Sandler comedy bit on his first album.
[22:47.600 --> 22:48.660]  I'm not aware of that one.
[22:48.860 --> 22:49.900]  Oh, it's an audio thing.
[22:50.000 --> 22:50.940]  Yeah, it's just like him.
[22:51.200 --> 22:52.620]  He can't stop pissing for like an hour.
[22:52.820 --> 22:53.280]  It's a whole thing.
[22:53.380 --> 22:53.700]  It's funny. I see.
[22:54.480 --> 22:55.600]  Okay, and you live that.
[22:55.720 --> 22:56.300]  This is your life.
[22:56.420 --> 22:58.220]  This is inspired by you at this time.
[22:58.880 --> 23:00.780]  Yeah, I guess we live that. Connect to that content in a deeper level.
[23:01.020 --> 23:04.360]  Anyway, Gavin, I just want to say on record, that's the most
[23:04.360 --> 23:06.380]  fun I've had peeing in years.
[23:06.720 --> 23:11.260]  And I'm really, really glad that I got to pee with you for a long
[23:11.260 --> 23:13.900]  time and that it was such a fun, funny pee.
[23:14.440 --> 23:16.920]  And if you ever want a long pee again, let me know.
[23:17.100 --> 23:21.720]  I know it's hard to recreate magic, but man, I do want to try it.
[23:21.760 --> 23:22.140]  Because that was a good time.
[23:22.140 --> 23:24.500]  Yeah, I feel like we could try, but it felt like a one-off.
[23:24.760 --> 23:25.880]  I just really loved it.
[23:26.880 --> 23:28.400]  Almost no words were spoken.
[23:28.640 --> 23:30.540]  We were just both experiencing it.
[23:30.580 --> 23:32.180]  We both found it funny at the same moment.
[23:32.600 --> 23:33.240]  Oh, it was magic.
[23:33.680 --> 23:34.160]  Yeah, it was.
[23:34.160 --> 23:38.080]  It's the kind of moment you can only have between two
[23:38.080 --> 23:39.620]  friends that have known each other for more than a decade.
[23:40.960 --> 23:43.860]  What was the previous most amount of fun you've had pissing,
[23:43.940 --> 23:47.640]  Geoff? Because this took the position of something else.
[23:47.640 --> 23:48.540]  What is number two?
[23:48.620 --> 23:51.060]  I don't think I have a great pissing moment.
[23:51.600 --> 23:52.520]  I probably am.
[23:52.660 --> 23:56.200]  There's probably a lot that don't come to mind that I'm
[23:56.200 --> 23:57.720]  forgetting or I'm blanking on right now.
[23:58.820 --> 24:02.340]  I've peed in a lot of nefarious ways, especially when I was
[24:02.340 --> 24:05.860]  younger, you know, and and younger. You went on that security
[24:05.860 --> 24:07.000]  guard once, didn't you?
[24:07.340 --> 24:08.360]  No, yeah, you did.
[24:08.480 --> 24:11.040]  That's a great story. I did pee on a security guard.
[24:11.120 --> 24:11.820]  That sounds fun.
[24:13.540 --> 24:15.760]  I was gonna... yeah, no, that's a good one.
[24:17.360 --> 24:18.740]  I was thinking of a worse one.
[24:19.120 --> 24:22.480]  Yeah, no, I mean, I don't know.
[24:22.620 --> 24:23.960]  Do I tell these stories?
[24:24.500 --> 24:25.480]  Is it okay to tell this story?
[24:25.500 --> 24:27.160]  Because I've told it on other Rooster Teeth podcasts.
[24:27.400 --> 24:29.980]  You've told the security guard one on this podcast.
[24:30.520 --> 24:31.920]  Oh, well, then I don't have to tell it again.
[24:31.920 --> 24:32.500]  There you go.
[24:32.520 --> 24:33.460]  What's the worst one though?
[24:35.060 --> 24:36.680]  Did you pee on his kids?
[24:37.020 --> 24:37.660]  That would be worse.
[24:37.900 --> 24:38.740]  No, I didn't pee on his kids.
[24:38.780 --> 24:41.300]  I was thinking about the time I peed in that guy's duffel bag
[24:41.300 --> 24:42.600]  before he went to the airport.
[24:43.800 --> 24:44.920]  I don't know that one.
[24:45.460 --> 24:47.000]  I was roommates with this guy.
[24:48.100 --> 24:51.980]  I was roommates with this guy in journalism school for Ben
[24:51.980 --> 24:57.180]  Harrison, who was such a prick and I tried to like him a lot.
[24:57.280 --> 24:58.220]  I'm not gonna say his name.
[24:58.420 --> 24:59.100]  I'm not gonna do anything.
[24:59.660 --> 25:02.820]  All the things that I hate about him are super identifying, so
[25:02.820 --> 25:03.560]  I won't say them.
[25:04.340 --> 25:07.000]  But I will say that he was, I tried really hard to like him
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.440]  and he was just a just a cocky prick and he was never nice
[25:11.440 --> 25:15.840]  to me and always rude and he graduated journalism school as
[25:15.840 --> 25:19.340]  we all most of us did eventually and he went on to his duty
[25:19.340 --> 25:20.760]  station wherever that was in the army.
[25:20.880 --> 25:22.560]  And please take into consideration.
[25:22.720 --> 25:24.040]  I am a 46 year old man now.
[25:24.120 --> 25:24.840]  I'm a different person.
[25:24.880 --> 25:26.200]  I was 18 at the time.
[25:26.200 --> 25:30.880]  I was a very dumb, very inexperienced, very a volatile 18
[25:30.880 --> 25:34.240]  year old. And so I was talking to him the night before he
[25:34.240 --> 25:37.520]  was packing up his duffel bag and you know, because you
[25:37.520 --> 25:39.420]  throw everything into your duffel bag and then you lock
[25:39.420 --> 25:41.960]  it and then you take off and you carry that around the
[25:41.960 --> 25:42.440]  airport or whatever.
[25:42.760 --> 25:44.560]  And so he was like, yeah, I'm getting up.
[25:44.620 --> 25:45.360]  I gotta get up pretty early.
[25:45.520 --> 25:46.780]  My flight's at like 7 a.m.
[25:46.780 --> 25:49.600]  So I'm gonna leave the room at like 5 a.m.
[25:50.680 --> 25:53.160]  So to meet the driver or whatever.
[25:53.160 --> 25:56.540]  So you want to say, you know, best of luck.
[25:56.620 --> 25:58.640]  It was nice being a roommate with you for six months or
[25:58.640 --> 25:59.800]  whatever. And I was like, yeah, okay, cool.
[26:00.100 --> 26:02.120]  So I got up at 4 a.m.
[26:02.140 --> 26:05.380]  before he got up and while he was still asleep, I opened
[26:05.380 --> 26:06.860]  up his duffel bag.
[26:07.060 --> 26:07.940]  He hadn't locked it yet.
[26:08.580 --> 26:13.460]  And in it were his class A shoes, which are like army
[26:13.460 --> 26:16.100]  dress shoes. And I took them in the bathroom and I peed
[26:16.100 --> 26:18.200]  in them a little bit and then I put them back in the
[26:18.200 --> 26:20.460]  duffel bag and then I put all his clothes back in and
[26:20.460 --> 26:22.980]  then for good measure, I just peed in the duffel bag a
[26:22.980 --> 26:25.020]  little bit and then I shut it up and I went back to bed
[26:25.020 --> 26:26.600]  and I never talked to him or saw him again.
[26:26.780 --> 26:29.740]  I assume he figured it out at some point. Not something
[26:29.740 --> 26:30.740]  I would do now.
[26:31.520 --> 26:32.440]  I bet not.
[26:32.640 --> 26:35.100]  But when did you think he realized?
[26:35.800 --> 26:37.980]  Well, probably when he opened up the duffel bag wherever
[26:37.980 --> 26:39.340]  he got when he got there.
[26:41.800 --> 26:44.460]  Maybe he just thought like a dog at the airport pissed
[26:44.460 --> 26:44.980]  in it or something.
[26:45.420 --> 26:48.780]  Maybe he thought a dog in the airport, but you know,
[26:49.320 --> 26:51.680]  that was also like urine was commonplace.
[26:51.680 --> 26:54.680]  Like these are a bunch of like these are 18, 19 year old
[26:54.680 --> 26:56.760]  kids that are fucking living in military barracks.
[26:56.900 --> 26:57.740]  They can't go anywhere.
[26:57.940 --> 27:01.180]  So they get they just do dumb shit like a week before
[27:01.180 --> 27:03.720]  that. I remember this just popped into my head.
[27:03.880 --> 27:06.100]  We shared a bathroom with like suite mates and there
[27:06.100 --> 27:08.320]  were two other dudes on the other side a week before
[27:08.320 --> 27:11.020]  that. I was woken up at 2 in the morning by screaming
[27:11.020 --> 27:16.000]  and laughing and I ran into the other room and one of
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.960]  these guys one of the two guys I know was laughing while
[27:19.960 --> 27:22.560]  another guy was trying to beat him up and they were
[27:22.560 --> 27:26.800]  both naked and figured out what happened was the guy
[27:26.800 --> 27:29.720]  came in drunk and he thought it would be funny to piss
[27:29.720 --> 27:32.320]  on his roommates head while he was sleeping. And so
[27:32.320 --> 27:34.360]  the roommate woke up because he was getting pissed
[27:34.360 --> 27:37.580]  on in the head. And so he was angry the other and he
[27:37.580 --> 27:39.080]  started beating the shit out of the guy. The other
[27:39.080 --> 27:41.900]  guy was just drunk and laughing and still pissing. And
[27:41.900 --> 27:44.820]  so there was like a tangle of urine and 19 year or
[27:44.820 --> 27:47.720]  22 year old dudes or however old they were just rolling
[27:47.720 --> 27:50.400]  around. One of them was screaming and trying to kill
[27:50.400 --> 27:51.880]  the other one. The other one was just laughing his
[27:51.880 --> 27:56.720]  fucking ass off still peeing. And so that kind of
[27:56.720 --> 27:59.040]  shit happened all the time. I love the phrase that
[27:59.040 --> 28:01.280]  someone woke up because they were getting pissed
[28:01.280 --> 28:05.680]  on in the head. I had dude I had it people do weird
[28:05.680 --> 28:07.940]  shit in the army. I went on a trip one time to go
[28:07.940 --> 28:10.020]  surfing at Port Aransas with some friends of mine
[28:10.020 --> 28:11.660]  the guy that taught me how to surf army trip, right?
[28:11.880 --> 28:14.120]  This is when I was stationed at Fort Hood and I woke
[28:14.120 --> 28:16.640]  up in the middle of the night because one of my
[28:16.640 --> 28:20.180]  friends was laughing and it was like loud and I
[28:20.180 --> 28:22.660]  woke up and one of my friends this guy Dale had
[28:22.660 --> 28:25.580]  gotten really really drunk. We were all drunk, you
[28:25.580 --> 28:28.540]  know, we were kids. And he had taken all of our
[28:28.540 --> 28:31.920]  wallets and he had put them in the corner of a motel
[28:31.920 --> 28:33.860]  we were like a staying at like a motel 6 and he
[28:33.860 --> 28:35.400]  had put them on the corner of the room and was
[28:35.400 --> 28:39.840]  just pissing on them. His wallet, my wallet, my
[28:39.840 --> 28:42.140]  friend Mike's wallet, my friend Pete's wallet. He
[28:42.140 --> 28:44.520]  just put them in a pile and was just pissing on
[28:44.520 --> 28:46.660]  our wallets. I still to this day. I don't know
[28:46.660 --> 28:49.120]  why he did it. He was like blackout drunk. He just
[28:49.120 --> 28:51.240]  thought it would be a funny thing to do. Weird
[28:51.240 --> 28:53.540]  decision. Didn't remember doing it in the morning.
[28:53.700 --> 28:57.880]  Had no memory of it. I have so much respect that
[28:57.880 --> 29:00.100]  he put his of the pile too. His was in there too.
[29:02.160 --> 29:05.260]  He's like I'm gonna make it fair. It's like A who
[29:05.260 --> 29:08.260]  pisses on a wallet, B who pisses on all the wallets
[29:08.260 --> 29:11.520]  in front of us. Like I'm waking people up like
[29:11.520 --> 29:13.480]  Pete what's going on? Dale stop it. What are you
[29:13.480 --> 29:16.540]  doing man? He's like what? He had no fucking
[29:16.540 --> 29:19.020]  clue. It was like he was like sleep drunk pissing
[29:19.020 --> 29:21.500]  but he was laughing when he did it. It was fucking weird man.
[29:22.680 --> 29:25.200]  I when you piss on somebody when you use piss as
[29:25.200 --> 29:27.380]  a weapon and you piss on the head of someone and
[29:27.380 --> 29:29.440]  they go for the attack and you keep pissing. It's
[29:29.440 --> 29:31.740]  a great move. It's really hard to counter like
[29:31.740 --> 29:33.460]  how are you gonna go after him? Yeah, that's
[29:33.460 --> 29:35.160]  what I'm... well I know it's hard for the guy to
[29:35.160 --> 29:37.580]  stop but I'm saying like what when you go to
[29:37.580 --> 29:39.200]  punch him you're just gonna get peed on more and
[29:39.200 --> 29:41.560]  the guy just wins like you don't lose. Even if
[29:41.560 --> 29:43.080]  you're getting beat up you're continuing to win
[29:43.080 --> 29:45.060]  because you're pissing on the person. It's really
[29:45.060 --> 29:47.460]  hard to get in non-pissing range for an attack.
[29:47.700 --> 29:50.580]  Oh, yeah, yeah. It would be different. I don't
[29:50.580 --> 29:51.800]  wanna go off on a tangent but I probably have
[29:51.800 --> 29:53.720]  four or five... I probably have more pissing stories
[29:53.720 --> 29:56.640]  too about the army. It's a it's a it's a urine
[29:56.640 --> 29:59.500]  filled environment. It sounds like Eric wants
[29:59.500 --> 30:01.300]  us to get away from piss and onto the salad and

[33:18.570 --> 33:22.310]  so much. Do you guys want to do the room? I
[33:22.310 --> 33:24.150]  think we end on the room and start do the
[33:24.150 --> 33:25.510]  salad now. What do you think? Yeah, let's do
[33:25.510 --> 33:28.210]  that. Okay. I okay. Eric, you want to hop on
[33:28.210 --> 33:30.670]  and read the I guess we should take notes,
[33:30.750 --> 33:34.010]  right? On there's gonna be four salads. There
[33:34.010 --> 33:35.830]  will be four salads. Ladies, gentlemen,
[33:36.150 --> 33:38.250]  welcome. I have four salads that I'm going
[33:38.250 --> 33:40.470]  to be sharing with you today. Thank you so
[33:40.470 --> 33:44.430]  much for me for a salad segment of face.
[33:44.910 --> 33:48.010]  I'll be reading four salads. I think instead
[33:48.010 --> 33:50.930]  of you guys, do we guess right away after
[33:50.930 --> 33:52.610]  I give you what the salads are? Or do you
[33:52.610 --> 33:54.530]  write them down? And then we guess we go
[33:54.530 --> 33:57.130]  1234. What would you like to do? I think
[33:57.130 --> 33:58.710]  we do one at a time. Okay, we move to
[33:58.710 --> 34:00.290]  the next one. I'll get that. So we won't
[34:00.290 --> 34:01.870]  know all the salads before making the
[34:01.870 --> 34:04.210]  guess. Correct. I guess then we'll yeah,
[34:04.230 --> 34:06.010]  it'll narrow down who has what, but it's
[34:06.010 --> 34:07.670]  just a lot of ingredients to remember
[34:07.670 --> 34:09.670]  for all four. I'm just gonna write. I
[34:09.670 --> 34:10.870]  think you just read them and I'm going
[34:10.870 --> 34:12.590]  to write down my impressions as you go.
[34:12.770 --> 34:14.750]  Okay. Okay. Well, here's the first salad.
[34:15.050 --> 34:17.830]  I won't say who it is, obviously. Geoff has
[34:17.830 --> 34:20.290]  used a salad generator that we are all
[34:20.290 --> 34:22.230]  supposed to use and have used and
[34:22.230 --> 34:25.070]  there's a lot here. So bear with us. Also
[34:25.070 --> 34:27.310]  dressing, I think will not factor in
[34:27.310 --> 34:28.730]  because the dressings that were on this
[34:28.730 --> 34:32.070]  site were insane. And we so do not. So
[34:32.070 --> 34:33.370]  please ignore that there's no dressing.
[34:33.550 --> 34:34.690]  I mean, it's not it's not a generator
[34:34.690 --> 34:36.270]  in that it's random. You pick the
[34:36.270 --> 34:38.110]  ingredients that generates the recipe.
[34:38.430 --> 34:40.410]  Yes, correct. Which which is really just
[34:40.410 --> 34:42.370]  the recipe of here are all of these
[34:42.370 --> 34:43.690]  things, tear them up and put them in a
[34:43.690 --> 34:49.350]  bowl. Yeah. First salad, greens, romaine,
[34:49.670 --> 34:52.710]  watercress, iceberg lettuce, vegetables,
[34:53.590 --> 34:57.970]  carrots, celery, cucumber, tomato, radish,
[34:58.610 --> 35:03.910]  mushroom, fruit, apples, protein, eggs,
[35:06.010 --> 35:10.210]  grains, corn, yummify, pine nuts, goat
[35:10.210 --> 35:13.670]  cheese, croutons. That is salad number
[35:13.670 --> 35:19.650]  one. Okay. Sal, are you ready for salad?
[35:19.710 --> 35:21.630]  Now, are you guys writing things down?
[35:21.710 --> 35:22.850]  Should I move on to salad number two?
[35:22.970 --> 35:25.030]  I've I've written who I initially think
[35:25.030 --> 35:26.810]  it is. Now I'm gonna, you know, that and
[35:26.810 --> 35:28.270]  that opinion might change based on
[35:28.270 --> 35:30.870]  subsequent salads. Okay. Okay. Did you
[35:30.870 --> 35:32.550]  guys, did Andrew, Gavin, did you guys do
[35:32.550 --> 35:34.710]  the same thing? I, yeah, I took a note.
[35:34.810 --> 35:36.470]  So just to be clear, these are four
[35:36.470 --> 35:39.830]  salads. It's myself, Gavin, Geoff, and Nick.
[35:39.830 --> 35:43.730]  Correct. Yeah. Okay. Second salad, greens,
[35:44.190 --> 35:47.550]  spinach, vegetables, tomato, bell pepper,
[35:47.850 --> 35:52.370]  avocado, mushroom, fruit, none, protein,
[35:52.730 --> 35:56.970]  chicken, grains, corn, this little mix up
[35:56.970 --> 36:01.770]  here, dressing, salsa, guacamole, yummify,
[36:01.770 --> 36:05.290]  cheese and croutons. Okay. Very different
[36:05.290 --> 36:07.470]  from the last salad. Incredibly different
[36:07.470 --> 36:11.130]  from the last salad. Yeah. Okay. Yep. Here,
[36:11.290 --> 36:15.270]  I, oh boy, how am I gonna, okay, here we
[36:15.270 --> 36:18.170]  go. Here we go. Andrew for this one.
[36:18.550 --> 36:21.930]  This is, uh, Andrew. Here is, here it is.
[36:22.130 --> 36:27.610]  Greens, Boston lettuce, vegetables, bell
[36:27.610 --> 36:30.990]  peppers. That's not the only greens.
[36:34.840 --> 36:38.680]  You okay, Eric? You alright, Eric? The point of the game.
[36:38.700 --> 36:40.360]  You're missing your greens, Eric. The point of the game.
[36:41.600 --> 36:43.620]  The point of the game is that you're supposed to,
[36:45.200 --> 36:48.640]  you're supposed to guess who it is. And he just
[36:48.640 --> 36:54.940]  stepped in and said, that's not, that's not. Well, we know it's him. I've already written his name down. I had already written down his name.
[36:55.000 --> 36:58.020]  The second Eric said, oh boy, I wrote down
[36:58.020 --> 37:01.400]  Andrew. Eric told us everything we needed to know before you made a single
[37:01.400 --> 37:06.700]  ingredient. I'm just, I'm gonna start at the top because it's all out of order and I'm just gonna read these ingredients.
[37:07.560 --> 37:13.120]  Why don't you just do a screenshot? I, listen, this is. I didn't do a screenshot. I screenshotted it.
[37:13.260 --> 37:16.860]  I just, I thought that was easier to read what I said. It's not. Here it is.
[37:16.900 --> 37:27.300]  Apparently not. Raisins, bell peppers, tomato, kidney beans, chicken, cheddar cheese, Boston
[37:27.300 --> 37:36.620]  lettuce, snake, orange, cashews, corn, blueberries, broccoli, spinach.
[37:39.260 --> 37:47.060]  You're leaving out some very important details of this salad, Eric. I can only read the ingredients and then you can tell everyone about your idea.
[37:48.200 --> 37:52.880]  Okay. Here is the last, this is, it's so, it was so difficult to parse that.
[37:53.800 --> 38:05.240]  Here is the last salad. Okay. Greens, romaine, vegetables, carrots, cucumber, tomato, radish, mushroom, red cabbage, fruit, none.
[38:06.100 --> 38:15.400]  Protein, chickpeas and chicken, grains, none. Yummify, sunflower seeds, bacon, cheese, and croutons.
[38:16.240 --> 38:20.980]  Those are the four salads for f***face. If you want to make those salads and then eat them,
[38:20.980 --> 38:30.420]  can you take a picture and send it to us? Because I, especially the third one that I read, starts with raisins.
[38:30.760 --> 38:34.260]  I love Andrew just stepping into the mystery salad and breaking it.
[38:35.420 --> 38:38.820]  That's not all the greens! That's not all the greens! That's not all the greens!
[38:39.300 --> 38:43.300]  Don't forget the spinach! The spinach is very important to the salad.
[38:43.720 --> 38:48.140]  Okay, well I have mine written down. Gavin, do you have yours? Andrew, do you have yours?
[38:48.820 --> 38:51.860]  Yeah, do you mean like predicting who made what?
[38:51.860 --> 38:57.140]  Yes, who do you believe was salad number one? That's with the romaine, watercress, iceberg lettuce.
[38:57.720 --> 39:01.020]  The standouts are pine nuts, goat cheese, croutons, really, and eggs to me.
[39:01.380 --> 39:05.400]  I wrote down Nick. Andrew, do you have a guess?
[39:05.860 --> 39:08.720]  I originally wrote down Nick and then I swapped to Gavin.
[39:08.800 --> 39:11.160]  Okay, and Gavin, do you have a guess? I do.
[39:11.360 --> 39:14.840]  And what's your guess? It was me! Damn it!
[39:15.060 --> 39:16.260]  Damn it, I got that one wrong.
[39:17.400 --> 39:19.480]  Gavin's salad. That was a tough one.
[39:19.740 --> 39:26.260]  I would eat that. It sounds good. It does. I like the eggs and everything in there. Very interesting.
[39:27.240 --> 39:29.520]  I do need to specify I want the mushrooms raw.
[39:29.900 --> 39:31.620]  Okay. Yeah, obviously. Mushrooms gotta be raw.
[39:32.040 --> 39:34.780]  What is the name of your salad? What's the name of it?
[39:35.380 --> 39:39.940]  A salad needs a name. I feel like that's a key part of salad criteria. You need a name for your salad.
[39:39.980 --> 39:42.500]  Right, with this thing that Andrew invented, it needs a name.
[39:42.600 --> 39:45.140]  I got a name. I got a name. Every salad has a name.
[39:46.060 --> 39:49.340]  Regulation Salad. That's a good name. It's a great name.
[39:50.420 --> 39:51.540]  Incredible. It's a great name.
[39:51.960 --> 39:54.460]  Incredible. So that's the Regulation Salad.
[39:54.940 --> 40:01.700]  The second salad, spinach. This is the one with the salsa and guacamole, cheese and crouton, the corns, the chicken, no fruit.
[40:02.360 --> 40:04.900]  The second salad. I went for Nick on this one.
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.220]  Okay, and Andrew? It is a topping. Yeah, I went Nick. There's a lot of dressing.
[40:09.220 --> 40:13.500]  Okay, and Geoff? I went with Gavin, but obviously I think Nick is the answer.
[40:13.500 --> 40:16.340]  And the answer is Nick. Absolutely.
[40:17.300 --> 40:19.680]  Okay, now onto the third salad.
[40:21.060 --> 40:26.500]  I wrote down Andrew. Oh, okay. I mean, to refresh your memory, this is the one that starts with raisins.
[40:29.380 --> 40:30.380]  Raisins and oranges.
[40:31.060 --> 40:33.500]  And Gavin, do you have a guess on the third salad?
[40:33.980 --> 40:35.480]  I went with Mr. Panton on that one.
[40:35.580 --> 40:38.020]  And Andrew, do you have a guess also on the third salad?
[40:38.400 --> 40:40.680]  That would be my salad. This would be my creation.
[40:40.880 --> 40:42.420]  What's the name of your salad?
[40:42.420 --> 40:49.260]  Well, this is an important... I wanted to honor somebody who is close to this show, a real icon, just in the world in general.
[40:49.460 --> 40:51.160]  This is called the Dinner Zimmer Salad.
[40:51.640 --> 40:54.240]  This is the ingredients, as I sent to Eric.
[40:54.760 --> 40:58.840]  I have taken every place he has worked, and I have...
[40:59.400 --> 41:03.160]  I have sourced an ingredient that is local to that place.
[41:03.260 --> 41:07.040]  When you think of these places, these ingredients apply to those places.
[41:07.440 --> 41:10.000]  They're iconic. I will take any questions.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.200]  And also, I think it's sort of cowardly to not have a dressing.
[41:13.380 --> 41:16.880]  It's a key part of the salad, even if we're not using the spreadsheet or whatever.
[41:17.180 --> 41:20.200]  So it's served, and this is my honey mustard mention.
[41:20.560 --> 41:24.460]  Honey mustard vinaigrette. Already got honey mustard in earlier, but this is my guarantee.
[41:24.900 --> 41:27.260]  Gonna mention honey mustard. The Dinner Zimmer.
[41:27.520 --> 41:30.000]  But I must point out that once again, we were trying to make...
[41:30.780 --> 41:33.600]  We were trying to make just a good base salad.
[41:33.880 --> 41:35.420]  This is the salad that I would eat.
[41:35.740 --> 41:36.000]  Okay.
[41:37.240 --> 41:37.680]  Alright.
[41:37.680 --> 41:42.360]  So then salad four, it sounds like, is pretty obviously my salad.
[41:42.440 --> 41:46.040]  Yeah, that is the one with the sunflower seeds, the bacon crouton, chickpeas.
[41:46.120 --> 41:47.500]  I was 100%.
[41:47.500 --> 41:49.740]  Yeah, you and Andrew both were 100%.
[41:49.740 --> 41:50.340]  Yeah.
[41:50.420 --> 41:51.520]  I was the only one.
[41:52.020 --> 41:52.340]  Way to go.
[41:52.780 --> 41:53.800]  Yeah, congratulations, guys.
[41:54.320 --> 41:55.560]  Boston lettuce, huh?
[41:56.040 --> 41:56.300]  Yeah.
[41:56.980 --> 41:59.760]  So then, Gavin, you're official...
[41:59.760 --> 42:02.800]  Nick's not here, so we can't ask him his salad name, unless he included it.
[42:03.180 --> 42:04.180]  He did not.
[42:04.180 --> 42:04.760]  Okay.
[42:04.880 --> 42:06.000]  So we're gonna call...
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.040]  So Gavin's is called Regulation Salad?
[42:08.560 --> 42:08.820]  Mm-hmm.
[42:08.900 --> 42:09.240]  Is that right?
[42:09.660 --> 42:10.020]  That is correct.
[42:10.020 --> 42:13.240]  And Andrew, yours is called the Dinner Zimmer Salad?
[42:13.280 --> 42:13.880]  The Dinner Zimmer.
[42:14.160 --> 42:14.440]  Okay.
[42:14.820 --> 42:15.260]  Well, that's interesting.
[42:15.580 --> 42:17.020]  I had a name as well.
[42:18.080 --> 42:22.120]  Funny how our naming conventions tend to overlap.
[42:22.620 --> 42:25.700]  My salad is called the Regulation Zimmer Salad.
[42:30.100 --> 42:31.260]  So that's interesting.
[42:31.880 --> 42:34.720]  You came up with that two seconds ago.
[42:34.960 --> 42:35.880]  The salad name.
[42:36.140 --> 42:36.760]  Oh, no, no.
[42:36.880 --> 42:38.200]  I came up with it before that.
[42:39.000 --> 42:39.440]  Interesting.
[42:40.100 --> 42:40.320]  Yeah.
[42:41.360 --> 42:42.900]  I'm gonna send...
[42:42.900 --> 42:46.500]  This was my full note for my salad.
[42:46.840 --> 42:48.220]  Wait, what you sent wasn't your full note?
[42:48.220 --> 42:48.960]  No, no, no.
[42:49.020 --> 42:49.860]  That was...
[42:49.860 --> 42:54.060]  He sent this unprovoked with no explanation.
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.020]  Well, okay, what happened was I was gonna edit a few things when I sent it, but when
[42:59.020 --> 43:01.160]  you hit enter in Slack, it just sends the message.
[43:01.320 --> 43:05.460]  I was trying to drop down, so I just said, whoops, I still have stuff I want to add.
[43:06.060 --> 43:07.660]  I mean, you can edit on Slack.
[43:08.180 --> 43:09.380]  But you can edit that post.
[43:09.800 --> 43:11.720]  I don't, you know, I don't know how to do that.
[43:11.920 --> 43:12.840]  It seems like work.
[43:13.120 --> 43:14.400]  Well, I wanted a dropdown.
[43:14.580 --> 43:16.480]  How do you do the dropdown without hitting enter?
[43:16.720 --> 43:17.320]  Without submitting?
[43:17.880 --> 43:18.980]  What do you mean the dropdown?
[43:19.360 --> 43:22.620]  You see how it's like one line LA Dodgers, next line Chicago?
[43:22.920 --> 43:23.340]  Shift enter?
[43:24.400 --> 43:24.780]  Oh, really?
[43:24.920 --> 43:25.540]  That's how you do that?
[43:25.720 --> 43:28.620]  Well, I think in every field everywhere, that's how you get down a line.
[43:28.620 --> 43:29.480]  Yeah, that would be correct.
[43:29.760 --> 43:30.720]  I didn't know that.
[43:30.900 --> 43:32.760]  Okay, this is my notes.
[43:32.920 --> 43:37.120]  These are the full extensive notes of my salad.
[43:37.220 --> 43:38.260]  I did a lot of research.
[43:38.540 --> 43:39.700]  I thought a lot about it.
[43:40.020 --> 43:44.440]  Texas Rangers, George Foreman sponsored a grill steak.
[43:45.420 --> 43:47.620]  Well, George Foreman was born in Texas.
[43:47.860 --> 43:48.960]  He's a Texas icon.
[43:48.960 --> 43:51.920]  When you think of George Foreman, you think of the George Foreman grill.
[43:52.060 --> 43:53.560]  Name a better thing to grill than a steak.
[43:54.140 --> 43:57.840]  New York Yankees, nuts for nuts, cashews.
[43:57.840 --> 44:01.480]  I mean, Don Zimmer seemed like a nuts guy.
[44:02.600 --> 44:04.140]  He seemed like a nuts dude.
[44:04.360 --> 44:07.520]  So these are just your justifications for these things?
[44:08.040 --> 44:10.660]  Yeah, this is why these things are what they are.
[44:10.980 --> 44:15.920]  I could see Don Zimmer going to the stadium, getting the nuts, getting some nuts from the vendor.
[44:16.020 --> 44:19.140]  There's a bunch of vendors, nut for nuts, the leading vendor in New York for nuts.
[44:19.540 --> 44:23.500]  New York Mets, King of Queens, Kevin James loves pizza.
[44:24.260 --> 44:25.740]  End result, tomato.
[44:26.200 --> 44:29.160]  Yeah, well, the New York Mets, they're based in Queens.
[44:29.380 --> 44:31.140]  So I went to the King of Queens.
[44:31.360 --> 44:35.120]  And if you search Kevin James food, you get a bunch of photos of him eating pizza.
[44:35.340 --> 44:36.500]  The guy loves pizza.
[44:36.860 --> 44:42.120]  So to honor the King of Queens, where Don Zimmer played or was...
[44:42.120 --> 44:44.120]  Yeah, I think he's a player for the Mets.
[44:44.740 --> 44:45.260]  Got a tomato.
[44:45.560 --> 44:52.600]  I like that Eric thought that 25 minutes was too much time to invest in recreating by drawing Andrew's room.
[44:52.600 --> 44:55.680]  Andrew has clearly put days of work into this.
[44:55.800 --> 45:01.920]  This was like, no, this was, listen, you wanted me, you said the salad thing, I put the time in.
[45:02.160 --> 45:03.000]  I felt this was important.
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.640]  I appreciate it. It's not a criticism of you.
[45:04.820 --> 45:07.280]  I appreciate you, the effort that you've put into this.
[45:07.920 --> 45:10.580]  Washington Senators, Washington, they were in DC.
[45:11.320 --> 45:15.740]  DC, when I think of DC, you think of Daniel Cormier, one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time.
[45:16.020 --> 45:17.120]  Guy loves Popeyes.
[45:17.500 --> 45:18.240]  Gotta go with chicken.
[45:18.740 --> 45:21.760]  Did a whole music video about Popeyes chicken, dancing about it.
[45:21.760 --> 45:23.060]  It's a clear chicken take.
[45:23.160 --> 45:23.860]  I don't know what you want.
[45:24.140 --> 45:27.160]  Name something more Californian than California raisins.
[45:27.660 --> 45:28.200]  Try.
[45:31.380 --> 45:32.580]  But you can't.
[45:33.620 --> 45:36.380]  Oranges. I always think of oranges with California.
[45:36.520 --> 45:37.700]  You didn't even use oranges there.
[45:37.980 --> 45:38.480]  No, I didn't need to.
[45:38.480 --> 45:39.380]  I think of Florida for oranges.
[45:39.940 --> 45:43.180]  Got the Montreal Expos, classic restaurant, the orange tulip.
[45:43.280 --> 45:44.100]  It's a giant orange.
[45:44.240 --> 45:45.240]  They serve orange products.
[45:45.380 --> 45:47.600]  Hot dogs, iconic staple of Montreal.
[45:48.200 --> 45:48.840]  Didn't need it.
[45:49.380 --> 45:50.120]  Classic restaurant.
[45:50.900 --> 45:52.040]  I'm exhausted by that.
[45:52.260 --> 45:52.700]  Yeah.
[45:52.880 --> 45:54.340]  What was your Tampa ingredient?
[45:55.520 --> 45:57.100]  John Cena loves broccoli.
[45:57.320 --> 45:57.740]  Broccoli.
[45:58.080 --> 45:59.880]  So, John Cena born in Tampa.
[46:00.540 --> 46:02.700]  Clearly, he's big right now in the fast movies.
[46:02.980 --> 46:04.780]  He's part of the family in general.
[46:04.920 --> 46:06.040]  We love some John Cena.
[46:06.280 --> 46:07.880]  What's the ingredient from that place?
[46:07.980 --> 46:10.480]  Let me think of someone who likes something from there.
[46:10.580 --> 46:11.220]  I don't understand.
[46:11.500 --> 46:13.220]  John Cena's from Massachusetts.
[46:14.620 --> 46:15.280]  Is he?
[46:15.660 --> 46:17.820]  Yeah, he's from Massachusetts.
[46:19.460 --> 46:20.340]  Let's do...
[46:24.400 --> 46:27.960]  He's built from West Newbury, Massachusetts, which is not Boston.
[46:28.540 --> 46:30.860]  But that's where he's, I'm pretty sure, born and raised.
[46:31.540 --> 46:32.340]  John Cena.
[46:32.540 --> 46:33.620]  Well, let's see.
[46:33.660 --> 46:35.100]  Maybe he went to Florida once.
[46:35.400 --> 46:36.260]  No, he was born...
[46:36.260 --> 46:36.740]  He was...
[46:36.740 --> 46:37.560]  Oh, I got it.
[46:37.640 --> 46:39.440]  He was in that movie, Sisters.
[46:40.200 --> 46:41.660]  And that took place in Orlando.
[46:42.120 --> 46:43.640]  So, maybe that's what you're thinking of.
[46:44.040 --> 46:44.740]  Oh, I got it.
[46:44.740 --> 46:50.380]  I searched famous people that were born in Tampa Bay known for.
[46:50.600 --> 46:51.740]  I guess maybe I didn't...
[46:54.840 --> 46:56.260]  Well, that's disappointing.
[46:56.280 --> 46:57.520]  I'm going to have to re-evaluate.
[46:58.060 --> 46:59.600]  I'm going to have to re-evaluate Tampa.
[47:01.360 --> 47:05.240]  I would not recommend searching what John Cena's favorite food is.
[47:05.420 --> 47:08.160]  It goes to a place you would not anticipate.
[47:09.400 --> 47:09.680]  Oh.
[47:10.220 --> 47:10.900]  It's a whole thing.
[47:11.660 --> 47:12.220]  Good to know.
[47:12.760 --> 47:18.800]  So, you can't find the documentation that you found initially that says he's from Tampa?
[47:19.660 --> 47:20.480]  No, I cannot.
[47:20.960 --> 47:22.260]  I don't know where I got that from.
[47:22.460 --> 47:23.220]  I guess...
[47:23.740 --> 47:24.500]  I'll look into it.
[47:24.540 --> 47:25.560]  I'm sure I read it somewhere.
[47:26.040 --> 47:28.420]  I didn't just come up with Tampa Bay John Cena.
[47:28.940 --> 47:30.420]  I was very excited about that, too.
[47:30.800 --> 47:33.300]  What a disappointment of a reveal that is.
[47:34.820 --> 47:37.120]  I feel like that really undercuts my salad.
[47:37.300 --> 47:38.860]  That really hurts the theme of it.
[47:39.900 --> 47:40.460]  Oh, man.
[47:41.200 --> 47:42.220]  I'm sorry, buddy.
[47:42.420 --> 47:43.220]  That's sad.
[47:43.480 --> 47:45.360]  I still think I have the best salad.
[47:45.940 --> 47:48.060]  Fuck! Are you telling me I'm older than John Cena?
[47:48.720 --> 47:49.440]  Yeah, what do you mean?
[47:49.740 --> 47:51.900]  Is that surprising to you?
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.360]  He's an action movie star.
[47:54.080 --> 47:55.780]  Well, so is Liam Neeson, dumbass.
[47:56.040 --> 47:57.840]  He seems like such a grown-up to me.
[47:59.480 --> 48:02.060]  You think John Cena is a grown-up?
[48:02.520 --> 48:03.820]  He seems like a grown-up to me.
[48:04.960 --> 48:06.880]  He worked for like...
[48:06.880 --> 48:09.760]  He's a pro wrestler and dressed like a giant toddler.
[48:09.760 --> 48:10.420]  What?
[48:14.920 --> 48:16.500]  He did dress like a giant toddler.
[48:17.600 --> 48:19.380]  However, he feels like a grown-up to me.
[48:19.440 --> 48:20.680]  It's the same problem I have with Fast and Furious.
[48:20.860 --> 48:22.840]  He's supposed to be Vin Diesel's younger brother.
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.520]  And I just can't make it make sense that he's younger than Vin Diesel.
[48:25.600 --> 48:26.520]  I know he is.
[48:26.640 --> 48:26.980]  Really?
[48:27.120 --> 48:29.140]  But in my head, Vin Diesel's like...
[48:29.140 --> 48:29.560]  I don't know.
[48:30.040 --> 48:32.280]  Like a 22-year-old in an old dude's body.
[48:32.280 --> 48:32.500]  Are you serious?
[48:32.660 --> 48:33.440]  What the fuck?
[48:33.680 --> 48:34.500]  What the fuck?
[48:34.500 --> 48:36.220]  What a weird...
[48:36.220 --> 48:38.320]  In my head, Vin Diesel's like 55.
[48:38.320 --> 48:39.940]  He is about 55, yeah.
[48:40.260 --> 48:42.420]  I just think of him forever as like...
[48:42.420 --> 48:42.800]  I don't know.
[48:43.480 --> 48:44.420]  You don't think of him...
[48:44.420 --> 48:45.320]  I don't think of him as a grown-up.
[48:45.440 --> 48:45.740]  I don't know.
[48:46.320 --> 48:47.680]  What a weird thing that is.
[48:47.920 --> 48:48.300]  I guess.
[48:48.360 --> 48:48.640]  Why?
[48:49.420 --> 48:51.860]  Why do you not view him as it's like how he looks?
[48:52.080 --> 48:52.840]  I guess so.
[48:53.020 --> 48:53.560]  I don't know.
[48:53.620 --> 48:54.400]  I don't know what it is.
[48:54.460 --> 48:55.420]  He just like...
[48:55.420 --> 48:56.580]  Maybe it's because...
[48:56.580 --> 48:57.200]  His boyish charm?
[48:57.200 --> 49:03.620]  Maybe it's because most of my Vin Diesel has been Vin Diesel in Fast and the Furious.
[49:03.800 --> 49:04.680]  And he...
[49:04.680 --> 49:07.420]  His character wears the same clothes in one as he does in nine.
[49:07.420 --> 49:08.420]  And so...
[49:09.220 --> 49:10.500]  In one, he's like 19.
[49:10.820 --> 49:11.900]  And in nine, he's 80.
[49:12.160 --> 49:14.360]  And he's still wearing the same like...
[49:14.360 --> 49:16.120]  He's not 19 in one.
[49:17.020 --> 49:17.920]  How old is he in one?
[49:18.300 --> 49:19.700]  I gotta be in his 30s.
[49:20.260 --> 49:22.520]  I'd say late 20s to early 30s.
[49:22.520 --> 49:24.920]  In the story, he's supposed to be in his 30s?
[49:24.960 --> 49:28.420]  Oh, in the story, I'd say mid-20s would be my guess.
[49:28.980 --> 49:29.900]  Mid to late, once again.
[49:30.080 --> 49:33.280]  How old is Vin Diesel?
[49:33.280 --> 49:35.980]  I mean, they gotta show his driver's license at some point.
[49:35.980 --> 49:38.120]  I went to the new one where they do a flashback to 1989.
[49:38.940 --> 49:41.480]  And I just looked at Vin Diesel's character and just thought...
[49:42.120 --> 49:44.220]  Vin Diesel wishes he looked like that in 1989.
[49:45.380 --> 49:47.640]  Wasn't he selling shark toys in 1989?
[49:48.720 --> 49:51.840]  I feel like Geoff just constantly has Vin Diesel shark toys.
[49:52.320 --> 49:53.340]  Vin Diesel, as is.
[49:53.940 --> 49:54.580]  How old he is.
[49:55.380 --> 49:56.460]  What are the shark toys called?
[49:57.240 --> 49:58.220]  You know what I'm talking about, Eric?
[49:58.660 --> 49:59.800]  I feel like you're the only one.
[49:59.880 --> 50:00.700]  The shark toys.
[50:00.740 --> 50:01.620]  They're called street sharks.
[50:01.900 --> 50:02.500]  They were Jawsome.
[50:02.720 --> 50:03.440]  Thank you.
[50:03.880 --> 50:04.120]  Yeah.
[50:04.920 --> 50:05.360]  Jawsome.
[50:06.620 --> 50:07.800]  Yeah, this is great.
[50:07.960 --> 50:08.820]  Let's drop this in.
[50:08.920 --> 50:11.280]  I feel like in Geoff's head, this is how old...
[50:11.280 --> 50:12.840]  So are we cutting all this part out?
[50:12.860 --> 50:14.260]  Or what's going on?
[50:14.720 --> 50:16.060]  Like, this isn't...
[50:16.060 --> 50:17.040]  Like, I can't imagine...
[50:17.040 --> 50:20.320]  This is just Andrew going, shark toys, shark toys, shark toys.
[50:20.420 --> 50:25.500]  And Geoff going, how old is Vin Diesel in Fast...
[50:25.500 --> 50:26.340]  There's no way this makes sense.
[50:26.360 --> 50:27.240]  Not about Vin Diesel.
[50:27.460 --> 50:31.480]  How old is Dominic Toretto in the first movie?
[50:31.580 --> 50:32.040]  Season one.
[50:33.040 --> 50:33.600]  Season one.
[50:33.600 --> 50:34.640]  Oh, Fast and Furious.
[50:36.020 --> 50:37.560]  I guess he kind of did look like that.
[50:38.200 --> 50:40.800]  That was a pretty accurate portrayal of him as a youngster then.
[50:41.260 --> 50:45.640]  I google how old is Dominic Toretto in the Fast and Furious and 40 is the first thing that pops up.
[50:45.800 --> 50:47.400]  40 as of the eighth film.
[50:47.800 --> 50:48.460]  Yeah, look at this.
[50:49.860 --> 50:50.880]  How old is...
[50:50.880 --> 50:51.720]  Okay, this is a screen...
[50:51.720 --> 50:52.600]  Like, look at those two pictures.
[50:53.080 --> 50:53.660]  He's still...
[50:53.660 --> 50:55.140]  That's why I don't think he's a grown-up.
[50:55.740 --> 50:57.740]  Because he's still wearing the same clothes he was wearing...
[50:57.740 --> 50:59.820]  He's still wearing the same shirt he was wearing when he was 19.
[51:00.440 --> 51:04.780]  The only thing that's the same is the shirt. Everything else has aged rapidly.
[51:04.960 --> 51:05.680]  Well, obviously.
[51:05.980 --> 51:06.780]  He looks completely different.
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.620]  But I don't think of him as a grown-up. I think of him as a man-child.
[51:09.980 --> 51:11.240]  I'm not saying I don't think of him as old.
[51:12.340 --> 51:13.740]  I just don't think of him as a grown-up.
[51:14.140 --> 51:15.980]  That's the weirdest tangent we've had.
[51:16.320 --> 51:17.700]  I don't understand why it's weird.
[51:18.400 --> 51:21.100]  There's lots of people that are old that I don't think of as, like, old.
[51:21.220 --> 51:23.540]  And there's lots of people that are young that I think of as, like...
[51:23.540 --> 51:26.660]  Being a grown-up is all about, like, how you carry yourself.
[51:26.860 --> 51:28.080]  Yeah, yeah, I get that.
[51:28.080 --> 51:31.140]  Oh! Dom's date of birth, August 29th, 1976.
[51:31.920 --> 51:32.520]  Yeah, I saw that.
[51:32.880 --> 51:33.500]  Oh, okay.
[51:34.380 --> 51:35.720]  So when did the first movie come out?
[51:36.420 --> 51:41.180]  Well, the year it came out doesn't represent necessarily what year the story took place in.
[51:41.420 --> 51:42.960]  What year did the story take place?
[51:43.480 --> 51:44.140]  I have no idea.
[51:45.500 --> 51:49.360]  I think it was a period piece. I think it was in the year that it came out.
[51:49.620 --> 51:54.840]  You think that every... so the year of the movie is the year of the story as well?
[51:55.080 --> 51:55.940]  Like, they're connected?
[51:56.420 --> 51:57.740]  I think we can assume that they're close.
[51:57.740 --> 51:58.440]  Okay.
[51:58.940 --> 51:59.300]  Hmm.
[52:00.200 --> 52:00.560]  Minus...
[52:01.480 --> 52:01.840]  19...
[52:02.340 --> 52:03.220]  This whole bit.
[52:04.380 --> 52:06.940]  This IQ... we have to cut this out. Like, what is this?
[52:06.980 --> 52:14.280]  According to this... no, cut it out, that's fine. According to this, he was about 20... according to the story, he should have been about 25 years old in Fast 1.
[52:14.540 --> 52:21.860]  It's not... I don't think your point is weird, Geoff. I think Vin Diesel's a weird person to be the president of the Younger Than He Looks Club.
[52:22.400 --> 52:22.560]  Really?
[52:22.580 --> 52:23.400]  That's what I think is odd.
[52:23.660 --> 52:26.120]  Yeah, I don't think Vin Di... I think Vin Diesel looks his age.
[52:26.120 --> 52:29.340]  Not younger than he looks, younger than he presents himself and acts.
[52:29.720 --> 52:30.520]  Oh, God.
[52:31.720 --> 52:32.640]  You've lost me now.
[52:33.860 --> 52:41.040]  It's what I just said earlier. Being a grown-up isn't about age as much as how you carry yourself and the demeanor. I don't think he carries himself as a grown-up.
[52:41.640 --> 52:43.260]  Okay. I see what you're saying.
[52:43.420 --> 52:45.100]  I just don't understand how it's hard not to.
[52:45.420 --> 52:47.040]  Hard not to understand what you're saying?
[52:47.200 --> 52:50.400]  Yeah, I feel like it's pretty fucking clear what I'm saying, and it's very...
[52:50.400 --> 52:54.420]  Well, I think it's, like, partially understood and also partially just baffling.
[52:54.420 --> 52:58.800]  No, I feel like we established that, but we also established that about eight minutes ago, and now we've just been quietly...
[52:59.680 --> 53:01.060]  Well, yeah, but that all got cut.
[53:01.380 --> 53:04.480]  Okay, so, should we move on to the room?
[53:05.100 --> 53:05.800]  Yeah, can you guys...
[53:05.800 --> 53:06.240]  Or maybe...
[53:06.240 --> 53:07.280]  What? No, go ahead, Geoff.
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.360]  I was just gonna say, maybe we saved... we're, like, an hour in. Maybe we should save that for next week.
[53:11.400 --> 53:16.500]  No, because the audience will fucking kill you. Just...
[53:16.500 --> 53:19.460]  Oh, we got a two. We could do the room next week.
[53:19.580 --> 53:20.500]  Oh, we should do the room now.
[53:20.940 --> 53:21.260]  Okay.
[53:21.580 --> 53:21.860]  Okay.
[53:21.860 --> 53:24.560]  Do you want to do the room now? Well, how do we want to do this?
[53:25.060 --> 53:34.820]  Well, let's do this. Andrew, why don't you describe, once again for us, I think you already read it earlier, but one more time, just read the description you gave us of your bedroom.
[53:35.420 --> 53:39.060]  Do we have a transition to this bit, or are we just gonna... where do we leave off?
[53:40.760 --> 53:41.460]  I don't...
[53:41.460 --> 53:42.140]  This is...
[53:42.140 --> 53:42.440]  I don't know.
[53:42.500 --> 53:44.100]  The best episode of this show.
[53:46.520 --> 53:47.840]  What do you mean, where...
[53:47.840 --> 53:53.680]  Well, if we're gonna cut all that last bit, or a lot of that last bit, how do we get from that to the room?
[53:57.840 --> 53:59.940]  I think it's just like that.
[54:02.920 --> 54:03.280]  Fucking...
[54:03.280 --> 54:03.680]  Sure.
[54:05.440 --> 54:06.160]  Four walls.
[54:06.960 --> 54:08.180]  Three doors on top.
[54:08.600 --> 54:08.960]  Alright.
[54:09.900 --> 54:12.220]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[54:12.380 --> 54:17.180]  Start over, because I want to get this clean, so that way everyone can hear it and draw themselves.
[54:17.180 --> 54:18.760]  I'm just feeling sorry for Nick.
[54:19.140 --> 54:19.480]  Okay.
[54:20.840 --> 54:21.640]  Four walls.
[54:22.400 --> 54:23.480]  Three doors all at the top.
[54:24.160 --> 54:27.560]  No wall has multiple doors on it, but one has two doorways.
[54:28.320 --> 54:29.120]  Two windows.
[54:29.880 --> 54:30.520]  Bed at the back.
[54:30.960 --> 54:34.260]  I don't know why I did that. They've all written their versions the previous week.
[54:34.760 --> 54:37.340]  That was the whole point of the last one. We did this. We covered this.
[54:37.440 --> 54:38.000]  It's to recap.
[54:38.620 --> 54:39.120]  Yeah, it's recap.
[54:39.580 --> 54:40.020]  Okay. Okay.
[54:40.060 --> 54:40.600]  Jesus Christ, man.
[54:40.620 --> 54:40.800]  Fair enough.
[54:41.800 --> 54:46.520]  Well, Eric just said it was for people to write. He wanted it clean so people could continue.
[54:46.520 --> 54:57.320]  The whole reason we're doing this, if you didn't listen last week, is because we've been hearing about the mystery that is Andrew Panton's room for 57, 58, 59 episodes now.
[54:57.520 --> 55:04.380]  And so we had the idea last episode to draw a top-down view of what we think Andrew's room looks like.
[55:04.480 --> 55:06.200]  And so those are the instructions he gave us.
[55:07.620 --> 55:11.240]  Gavin, would you like to drop your room into the Discord?
[55:11.680 --> 55:12.140]  Can do.
[55:12.780 --> 55:13.520]  What the fuck?
[55:13.920 --> 55:14.800]  Holy shit!
[55:15.300 --> 55:15.780]  Wow.
[55:15.780 --> 55:17.640]  Door with no door. Door.
[55:18.220 --> 55:18.660]  Door.
[55:18.660 --> 55:19.800]  This is a lot to unpack.
[55:20.420 --> 55:20.460]  Window.
[55:20.920 --> 55:21.720]  Waffle maker.
[55:22.640 --> 55:26.640]  Andrew is depicted in yellow. And all the labeling is in blue.
[55:28.940 --> 55:29.420]  Door.
[55:30.260 --> 55:31.040]  Piss collection.
[55:31.900 --> 55:33.320]  Oh, I didn't know he had a piss collection.
[55:33.720 --> 55:38.220]  I assume. I mean, he is piss boy. We haven't really covered what he does after he's looked at piss.
[55:38.220 --> 55:46.020]  But I thought maybe... yeah, the sushi box, yeah, Eric. And the fire extinguisher. Waffle maker. And you've got the tumbleweed with a handle in the top left.
[55:46.420 --> 55:56.880]  Oh my god. First off, should we ask Andrew what he thinks, how close it is? Or should we show mine and then do both of them at once?
[55:56.900 --> 56:01.600]  Yeah, I think we should show you. Well, I assume Andrew would have also drawn the actual room to compare ours to.
[56:01.740 --> 56:03.160]  No, why would I draw the room?
[56:03.360 --> 56:04.600]  So we know what the...
[56:04.600 --> 56:05.440]  So we know what it is.
[56:05.880 --> 56:07.500]  No, I took a video of the room.
[56:07.500 --> 56:12.120]  I did a video of the room and I have a blueprint of what the space is like.
[56:15.620 --> 56:19.220]  I used a tool, an architectural design tool.
[56:20.300 --> 56:23.620]  I like the way the doors open into each other.
[56:24.040 --> 56:30.500]  They do. So at the top, you've got the door leading into the rest of the house where I assume other people live.
[56:30.500 --> 56:39.160]  Immediately to the right of that is a desk with a fire extinguisher with a microphone attached to it next to a mini-fridge.
[56:39.540 --> 56:44.240]  All the way to the right is the door to the shitter. That's where you go and you do your shits and your baths.
[56:44.480 --> 56:48.760]  Then down that wall is a hole where a closet is where you make your hot dogs.
[56:50.300 --> 56:53.900]  He said most of the room is bed, so I tried to make the bed as large as possible.
[56:54.240 --> 56:57.460]  Don't want to forget the Casio keyboard. Put the eight pillows on.
[56:57.460 --> 57:00.500]  Didn't have room for the waffle maker, but we haven't talked about waffles in a while.
[57:00.620 --> 57:03.320]  I included the Pam and the Keurig just in case on the nightstand.
[57:03.600 --> 57:09.320]  All on the other side, you have a sushi box because I also wanted to be sure to include that.
[57:09.600 --> 57:15.520]  On the left wall, you've got a window. From that window, you can look to the right and see McDonald's and ladies peeing.
[57:16.380 --> 57:18.020]  Sight line to pee, lady.
[57:18.080 --> 57:22.180]  Further up that door is the outside door which opens up... well, it opens in.
[57:22.560 --> 57:25.080]  But it goes straight to McDonald's and urine.
[57:25.080 --> 57:27.780]  How close was I? How close was Gavin, Andrew? I gotta know.
[57:27.780 --> 57:31.060]  I can't believe how similar these are and also the level of effort.
[57:31.280 --> 57:34.300]  Like, I obviously spent the time doing it in the drawing.
[57:34.760 --> 57:41.140]  Geoff spent the time getting hold of an architectural tool and real images and the big keyboard.
[57:41.560 --> 57:43.340]  They're so similar. I love it.
[57:43.420 --> 57:44.160]  They're so similar.
[57:44.680 --> 57:48.520]  I don't know how to measure who's more correct.
[57:48.740 --> 57:51.300]  Like, the level of detail in both is fantastic.
[57:51.780 --> 57:54.880]  I'm gonna drop the blueprint first of just the space.
[57:54.880 --> 57:58.600]  And then I will do the video of the room.
[57:58.700 --> 58:00.380]  So this is, this is pulled.
[58:00.580 --> 58:01.540]  That's really small.
[58:01.540 --> 58:04.980]  That's the tiniest. Yeah, that's unfortunate. That did not work out very well.
[58:05.200 --> 58:08.080]  We will move to the video.
[58:11.620 --> 58:13.440]  Why is that so small?
[58:13.840 --> 58:14.300]  I don't know.
[58:14.300 --> 58:17.040]  Did that come from your phone? Is that what it does to videos?
[58:17.380 --> 58:21.660]  No, that came from my computer. I did that before we did the show.
[58:21.780 --> 58:23.580]  What's the resolution? 12 by 8?
[58:23.580 --> 58:25.060]  It was a screen grab.
[58:26.640 --> 58:29.400]  You sent us a 14 pixel image.
[58:31.480 --> 58:35.300]  We gotta put that in all of its size and glory on the Instagram.
[58:36.060 --> 58:36.560]  Oh my God.
[58:36.580 --> 58:39.040]  Here's the video. I'll put the video in.
[58:39.540 --> 58:40.320]  Here we go.
[58:40.500 --> 58:41.640]  This is the room.
[58:41.840 --> 58:43.300]  I can't wait for this.
[58:43.520 --> 58:44.440]  This is the room.
[58:44.500 --> 58:44.860]  Oh, okay.
[58:45.560 --> 58:47.040]  Oh, I'm feeling pretty good about that.
[58:47.700 --> 58:49.220]  I forgot about the sauce.
[58:49.760 --> 58:50.280]  There's that.
[58:50.280 --> 58:53.680]  Oh my God! I fucking nailed it!
[58:53.940 --> 58:58.400]  I'm so close! I got it 100%! I got it perfect!
[58:58.940 --> 59:00.220]  I nailed it perfect!
[59:01.080 --> 59:02.300]  I didn't miss anything!
[59:03.880 --> 59:05.640]  Geoff's done it, I think, with that.
[59:06.020 --> 59:09.740]  But here's some discrepancy in Geoff's drawing.
[59:09.900 --> 59:11.760]  The sushi container was by the fridge.
[59:12.000 --> 59:13.360]  That's where the sushi fall happened.
[59:13.360 --> 59:16.620]  Okay, fine. I bet there's been a sushi container there at some point, though.
[59:17.200 --> 59:18.460]  Nah, I don't know about that.
[59:18.460 --> 59:20.520]  Neither of us got the chest of drawers.
[59:20.860 --> 59:22.200]  No, I didn't do that. I forgot about that.
[59:22.420 --> 59:25.080]  Where are all the pillows? I feel like I've been lied to.
[59:25.460 --> 59:29.520]  Oh, no, the pillows are behind the bed at this point.
[59:30.440 --> 59:32.020]  Oh, where's the fridge?
[59:32.020 --> 59:33.580]  Geoff even got the sightline to the piss!
[59:34.140 --> 59:36.580]  That was a guess, dude. That was a total guess.
[59:36.780 --> 59:37.900]  You've nailed that!
[59:38.140 --> 59:42.020]  I can't believe it. Where's the mini fridge? Am I missing it?
[59:42.380 --> 59:43.900]  It is the sauce container.
[59:43.900 --> 59:45.900]  Oh, so I got that right, too!
[59:45.980 --> 59:47.860]  It's under the- oh my fucking god!
[59:49.080 --> 59:53.040]  Well, I think we both got the fridge position, didn't we?
[59:54.080 --> 59:56.420]  Well, Gavin's is more correct, I'd say.
[59:56.680 --> 59:57.820]  As far as the fridge position.
[59:57.960 --> 59:59.160]  But your door is off.
[59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.640]  My window behind the bed is off.
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.160]  Yeah, no, Geoff definitely wins this.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.960]  There's no Canadian flag like I was hoping.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:06.920]  No.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.060]  You know what this means?
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.640]  This means I speak full pantin.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.960]  I'm fully fluent in Andrew.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.100]  I'm like the Andrew Whisperer.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.400]  I can't believe I got it so close.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.100]  Well, I think it comes down to his description, I think, was very good.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.240]  It was. You got it very close, too, Gavin. You really did.
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.680]  Andrew is good at summarizing instructions.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.800]  I mean, even with the guy looking up.
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:32.680]  The description, when you listen to it, was actually very good.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.400]  You called me ridiculous for saying all doors at the top.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.380]  They're all at the top. I don't know what you want from me.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.640]  Well, because the top is at the top wall.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.120]  You don't walk into a room and be like, ah, stick that picture on the top wall.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.820]  If you look at this diagram, though, you would say the top is where I said it was.
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.460]  If you cut it down the middle...
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:51.420]  I'd say the back.
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.500]  You think that's the back? You think the front wall is the back?
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.040]  You think you enter from the back of the room?
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.080]  Well, we've drawn the whole thing upside down, haven't we?
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:04.080]  We're orientating it on your body, at your desk.
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.320]  Would you call your bedroom door the back door?
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.960]  There's no way it's the back door. It's the front.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.560]  I'd say that, yeah, I'd enter in the front and whatever I'm looking at is the back.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.060]  But none of it's the top, is what I'm saying. The ceiling's the top.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:21.280]  Sure, that's fair. I was just trying to stick with the words used for the face drawing.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.720]  And I think under that criteria, I was completely accurate in my detail of where the doors are.
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.720]  They're so similar.
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:38.100]  We can criticize your words all day long, Andrew, but those words put Gavin and I very close to each other in our design and very close to the actual room.
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:45.660]  So all criticism aside, it worked. I think that saying it's the top of the room was fucking stupid too, but it worked.
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:49.480]  I gotta watch the video again. I gotta see how big the bed is.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.520]  Oh, yeah. I wasn't checking for bed size.
[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:55.420]  There's so much to take in. I'm gonna have to watch this frame by frame later.
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.340]  Yeah, there's so much to learn in that room.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.480]  There's some clothes.
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.900]  What is that picture? What's that picture in the frame?
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.840]  It really is mostly a bed.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.160]  Why is there a step up into that door?
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:09.360]  Oh, that's a question.
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:12.240]  Oh, it's a, it's a patio. It goes to a patio.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.100]  Because that door is at the top.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.160]  It's like not on the ground.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:25.120]  There's some paper towels and a shoe.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.880]  Oh, there's so much to take in here.
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.820]  There's one shoe and there's some kitchen roll.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.520]  Oh, that is one shoe.
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.060]  Where's the other shoe?
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.020]  It's near the desk, I think. I don't know why it's in that corner.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.420]  What's in the yellow bowl?
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.600]  What is in the yellow bowl? That's a good question.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:41.800]  I'll see. I'll check.
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:43.760]  Are those the same headphones you use in the bathtub?
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.800]  The ones on the bed, yes. Those are the bathtub headphones.
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:47.820]  I'll be right back.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.200]  What's that big picture next to the closet?
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.840]  It looks like an x-ray of some shoes.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.960]  Oh, it is. It's an x-ray of shoes.
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:54.840]  What is it?
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.520]  It's just two bottles in the bowl. It's not that exciting of a bowl.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.140]  What's on the picture?
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.120]  Which picture?
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.660]  It looks like a shoe x-ray.
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.340]  Between the hot dog and the shit room.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.800]  That was somebody in the community who made that.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.900]  And they sold it, so I bought it.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:09.760]  But what is it?
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.160]  It's like two things of Converse shoes.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.560]  Oh, okay.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.740]  It's pretty normal.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.380]  You got the Halo 3 Legendary.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:21.460]  I do.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.480]  I'm still hanging on to that.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.300]  I can see inside the hot dog closet just a little bit.
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:30.460]  I'm surprised nobody is pointing out my super cool Sahara framed...
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:31.280]  What is that?
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.400]  I don't know what that is.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.900]  It's from the movie Sahara.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.380]  With Matthew McConaughey?
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.140]  Everyone's favorite action movie.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.460]  Is it like a real film sale?
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.120]  No, it's the two coins.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.540]  It's like they're chasing after these coins.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.060]  And they're two coins for the movie.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.480]  That they put into a thing.
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:50.960]  It was given to me as a birthday gift when I was younger.
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:54.400]  I might be the only person with Sahara merchandise on their wall.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.280]  Not exactly the biggest thing.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.500]  Can I be honest with you?
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.640]  I started to watch that movie when it came out.
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.660]  And I fucking left.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.480]  It's not that bad.
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:05.380]  Rainn Wilson in it.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:06.960]  Steve Zahn is on.
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.780]  I think the bed is the most confusing.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.820]  It looks like you have a tiny duvet.
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.580]  And it's scrunched up to become a pillow.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.160]  Where's the rest of the bed stuff?
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.400]  Part of it is on the floor.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:20.600]  Do you just sleep in a ball?
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.120]  With everything just curled?
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.320]  What's going on there?
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.420]  We're recording these earlier than we normally do.
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.660]  I just got out of bed and threw everything.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.800]  No criticism here, bud.
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:34.680]  I think it looks fine.
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:37.320]  I love that bit.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.480]  I can't wait for people to see our diagrams.
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:42.860]  I'm excited to see people's diagrams.
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:46.860]  I also love that we both put similar effort into it.
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.680]  But they both have their own distinct feels.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:55.300]  I love that you used black, white, and blue within the yellow Andrew.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.660]  It's striking, honestly.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.140]  And I was trying to do something similar in a notepad.
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:01.360]  Like writing it down on paper.
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:02.960]  And I couldn't do it justice.
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:03.880]  Which is why I switched.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.480]  What a segment.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.680]  We know Andrew way better than we thought we did, Gavin.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:17.820]  I would be able to translate Andrew into English to other people, I think.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.740]  I think you could.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.760]  I think I'd just speak English, based on the fact you both got it.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.300]  And I think we'll see with other people's drawings.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:30.180]  Once again, when we did the face thing, Geoff did terrible in all of his drawings.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.100]  Everyone else in the community nailed it.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.480]  So I think we'll see a lot of good drawings.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:39.740]  Do you think people in the community will draw the rooms before they see our diagrams?
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:41.040]  Oh, definitely.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.620]  Because we asked at the end of last episode to do that with the instructions.
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:49.100]  I think people are going to nail this.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:49.960]  I do too.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.500]  I bet we'll put like a thousand images up on the Instagram.
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:59.860]  It's weird, because the way Andrew describes stuff, a lot of the time when you first hear it, it's like, how is that possible?
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:03.220]  And then you see the video, and it's like, that's exactly what it is.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.780]  Yeah, I describe it as this.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.720]  I mean, there's no keyboard in the video, but...
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.200]  That is on a different bed. I moved it to a different bed, because I don't have a stand.
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.240]  That is a bed that is not used.
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:22.440]  So if we come to stay, we'll have to make room for the keyboard.
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:27.320]  Yeah, in the guest room, you'll have to move the keyboard off the bed.
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:30.580]  Here's what we'll do, Gav. We can share a bed. We've done that before.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.500]  We'll put the keyboard in between us to keep us honest.
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:36.900]  Yeah, can we do that when we come to stay, Andrew? Can we sleep on either side of the keyboard?
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.760]  Oh, you are welcome to sleep on either side of the keyboard.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:40.520]  I would love to do that.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.160]  I would love to do that.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.800]  From all of us inside your bedroom.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.920]  Oh, we've got to do it. Next bathtub race.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:54.160]  Next bathtub race. And obviously, we've got to give ourselves an hour and a half to find the place.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.920]  Oh, right, right. Yeah, there'll be that race, too.
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:01.600]  Alright, well, that was a jam-packed fucking episode.
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.880]  I'm afraid for next episode.
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:07.580]  Yeah, we'll have stuff.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.980]  Yeah, or we won't.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:14.080]  No, I think we'll be great. I think you've put a lot of pressure on us with the, this episode will suck.
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:16.700]  I think it, uh, unless, was that a reverse jinx?
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.180]  I didn't say this episode was going to suck. I think this episode's great.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:24.980]  Oh, what was the whole thing at the beginning about the last episode did really well, so this one is...
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:29.440]  Oh, like karmically, yeah, this one will tank, just because the last one did well.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.860]  But no, it won't be because of the content. It'll be because of the universe.
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:33.500]  Eric got mad.
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:35.540]  What's wrong, man?
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:38.960]  I have meetings after this, so we gotta wrap up.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.300]  Eric's angry. Let's wrap up.
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:44.400]  Thanks for listening to another episode of F*** Face.
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:49.580]  And congratulations, we all now know what Andrew's room looks like.
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:50.500]  We can all die.
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.820]  And if you don't die, we'll see you next week.
