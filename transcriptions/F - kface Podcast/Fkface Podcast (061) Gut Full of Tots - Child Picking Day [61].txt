[00:34.800 --> 00:42.340]  Hello and welcome to another episode of F*** Face. My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as
[00:42.340 --> 00:49.320]  always, my constant companions, Gavin Free and Andrew Panton. Hello! And not to be forgotten,
[00:49.600 --> 00:54.880]  our sound engineer, Nick and then Eric, the producer. Those guys, they're there too. They
[00:54.880 --> 00:59.240]  matter. So please don't forget them. Don't forget them in your prayers every night when you go to
[00:59.240 --> 01:05.140]  bed and you pray for us. And it's important. Nick, I feel like, is gonna have a big role in this
[01:05.140 --> 01:10.000]  episode to an extent. I mean, he automatically will because of one aspect, but we're gonna have
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.080]  to have some clarifications. I got a gut full of tots. Do you?
[01:18.220 --> 01:22.140]  I guess we should explain that, right? Do we want to just immediately go into...
[01:22.140 --> 01:26.860]  Yeah, I think we should. It's been the highlight of the week between recordings, for sure.
[01:27.300 --> 01:32.600]  We had an argument, like a weirdly, I don't like, just more of a bizarre, I don't even know how to
[01:32.600 --> 01:36.580]  classify it. I'll be honest, I'm blown away that Geoff is here today.
[01:37.060 --> 01:38.560]  That is true. After what happened in the Slack.
[01:38.560 --> 01:45.360]  This is my job, and I take my job extremely seriously. I would argue I take my job more
[01:45.360 --> 01:48.660]  seriously than anybody who works in our company. Yeah, I would agree.
[01:49.020 --> 01:53.460]  So the idea that I would not show up to do my job is insult.
[01:54.160 --> 01:58.160]  Well, not insult in the context of you're under protest right now.
[01:58.540 --> 02:04.980]  I'm protesting a specific bit on the show, but that doesn't preclude me from participating in
[02:04.980 --> 02:09.900]  the show. I won't be participating in that segment. I've registered an official complaint,
[02:10.260 --> 02:17.020]  and that's fine. I'm more than, but it's not my show. It's our show. I'm merely a piece,
[02:17.160 --> 02:23.600]  a wedge in the pie, as it were. So if you guys want to do that segment right now,
[02:23.680 --> 02:27.660]  I encourage you to do it, and I will cede the floor to you.
[02:27.940 --> 02:29.960]  So you're selectively not showing up?
[02:29.960 --> 02:35.620]  No, I'm here. I just, I can't contribute to this segment, but I'll sit here, I'll listen.
[02:35.760 --> 02:39.140]  What good are you if you're here, but you're not going to contribute to the show?
[02:39.440 --> 02:43.240]  I'm contributing to the show. I can't contribute to this segment because I'm protesting it.
[02:43.400 --> 02:44.500]  But it's part of the show.
[02:49.980 --> 02:52.940]  I don't understand. I just don't understand the protest.
[02:53.400 --> 02:55.980]  We got to get into it. Andrew, where did this begin?
[02:56.520 --> 03:02.020]  Well, this began with you. It's sort of, as mentioned when you were telling your fly stories
[03:02.020 --> 03:04.720]  several episodes ago, you've been re-watching Breaking Bad.
[03:05.120 --> 03:05.380]  I have.
[03:05.640 --> 03:10.880]  And there is an intro, I believe, to one of the episodes where a character is eating a bunch
[03:10.880 --> 03:11.740]  of dipping sauces.
[03:12.200 --> 03:18.820]  Yeah, you sort of reveal the boss behind the main boss of the previous season is a company
[03:18.820 --> 03:25.320]  called Madrigal in Germany. And the episode opens with a guy tucking into some honey mustard
[03:26.200 --> 03:29.260]  I just took a picture of the screen and said, it's Andrew. And I just said,
[03:29.340 --> 03:31.280]  is this your favorite scene from Breaking Bad?
[03:32.440 --> 03:34.760]  Because he's been on a honey mustard tear recently.
[03:35.760 --> 03:39.560]  I don't, it's just come up naturally quite a bit. I don't feel like I'm on a tear. I don't
[03:39.560 --> 03:43.460]  feel like I've been excessive about it. Just it's, there have been windows to talk about it
[03:43.460 --> 03:48.480]  and it has come up, but it extended. So Gavin sent me that. And then we're, I don't know how
[03:48.480 --> 03:53.120]  we got on the subject of it, but we're talking about like ideal dipping sauces. And if you
[03:53.120 --> 03:57.820]  were making a sauce, cause they made a sauce called French for Breaking Bad. And so we're
[03:57.820 --> 04:02.580]  talking about like, what would be your mix? And it just turned into a thing of, Oh, we should make
[04:02.580 --> 04:07.860]  sauces. We did a salad thing last week. We could do a condiment thing this week. It'd be kind of
[04:07.860 --> 04:11.740]  like a fun, dumb thing or whatever. Yeah. So we got into a conversation of
[04:11.740 --> 04:16.360]  what's the best condiment. And then we got into this whole other thing of like, well, what we need
[04:16.360 --> 04:21.040]  to know what's being used with the condiment. Cause like a burger sauce is different to like a
[04:21.040 --> 04:27.020]  dipping sauce. And I was talking about Tots at one point and we eventually settled on, we're
[04:27.020 --> 04:32.620]  going to be dipping Tots into this condiment. Yeah. Well, we want, you wanted to make something
[04:32.620 --> 04:37.120]  specifically for Tots. So then I said, I wanted to make something. I didn't want to make a
[04:37.120 --> 04:42.400]  completely different sauce item. So I figured I'd make that. We could both make our sauces.
[04:43.160 --> 04:49.600]  And because it was like a goofy fun thing, we opened it up to everybody and it was a mistake,
[04:49.600 --> 04:54.540]  apparently. Well, should we read through what the, uh, what the people's sauces were?
[04:55.020 --> 04:59.140]  Uh, we could do that. Or do you want to first go through the protest and how we
[04:59.140 --> 05:03.400]  got to that point? Well, I feel like if we read through all of the submitted sources
[05:03.400 --> 05:11.960]  ending in Geoff's, we'll all reveal the protest. Okay. That's fair. Nick submitted base ketchup,
[05:12.140 --> 05:18.300]  about two ounces, one squirt Dijon mustard, one squirt mayo, two dashes of Louisiana hot sauce.
[05:18.300 --> 05:23.240]  I actually submitted my first. So mine was just a very basic combination. I didn't really go
[05:23.240 --> 05:28.620]  too much into it. Mine was in ratios. Mine was two thirds ketchup, one third horseradish,
[05:29.100 --> 05:36.120]  and then a little splash of lemon. Andrew's was two teaspoons of hot sauce, one teaspoon barbecue
[05:36.120 --> 05:41.800]  sauce, one teaspoon honey mustard, one teaspoon ketchup, one teaspoon maple syrup, half teaspoon
[05:41.800 --> 05:49.100]  red chili flakes. And I should point out that he originally wrote one eighth teaspoon of pineapple
[05:49.100 --> 05:57.120]  juice. At that point you're into drops. Just a teardrop. You might as well write 380 fourths
[05:57.120 --> 06:01.660]  of a cup of pineapple juice. Anyway, you upped it to a one half teaspoon of pineapple juice.
[06:01.940 --> 06:10.140]  I did. Okay. Then we get onto Geoff's submission. Well, Geoff technically submitted two.
[06:10.140 --> 06:16.920]  And I will say that that there's some confusion mainly over his first submission. Okay. This is
[06:16.920 --> 06:21.740]  the one I've got in front of me. Okay. Sprinkle hot sauce with light dusting of chili powder.
[06:22.060 --> 06:28.060]  You've already got it wrong. You said hot sauce? I said hot tots. You can't even, you can't even
[06:28.060 --> 06:33.800]  agree, you idiot. All right, all right, let me read it. I put the sauce on the break. Okay.
[06:34.560 --> 06:39.580]  Sprinkle hot tots with the light dusting of chili powder. It won't take much. Then
[06:39.580 --> 06:47.880]  combine shredded pepper jack cheese with crisped up cube pancetta. Hot sauteed diced onions and
[06:47.880 --> 06:55.880]  some thin sliced chives and coat the tots. Done. That sounds delicious. My problem when I read
[06:55.880 --> 07:01.260]  that. It sounds like a wonderful side. It's a great side item. I wasn't sure where the sauce
[07:01.260 --> 07:07.620]  was in that. I didn't see the condiment in there. It was... Yeah. I actually read them all out to
[07:07.620 --> 07:11.840]  and I read Jess and she was like, come on.
[07:14.680 --> 07:23.120]  Wikipedia lists under condiments cheese. I then modified because you guys mentioned that it didn't
[07:23.120 --> 07:29.000]  sound like a condiment. I modified it. I replaced the shredded cheese with nacho cheese, which I
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.080]  would also point out is listed as an official condiment under the condiment section of
[07:34.080 --> 07:40.920]  Wikipedia. I would also like to read the definition of the fucking word condiment from
[07:40.920 --> 07:48.260]  Miriam Webster. Definition of condiment. Something used to enhance the flavor of a fucking food. Now
[07:48.260 --> 07:55.140]  allow me to read the definition of condiment from dictionary dot fucking com. Something used to give
[07:55.140 --> 08:01.340]  a special flavor to food as mustard, ketchup, salt, or spices. Let me then read the definition
[08:01.340 --> 08:08.520]  of condiment from the Cambridge fucking dictionary, which listed as a substance such as salt that you
[08:08.520 --> 08:17.240]  add to a food to improve its taste. Then let me read to you from Gordon Ramsey's Cumberland sauce
[08:17.240 --> 08:22.320]  recipe, which he lists as maybe you've heard of Cumberland sauce, Gavin, you're British. I haven't,
[08:22.320 --> 08:31.440]  but he lists it as a popular holiday condiment that then includes vegetable oil, minced onions,
[08:31.800 --> 08:38.700]  currant jelly, two oranges, lemon, red wine, orange juice, lemon juice, black pepper, brown sugar,
[08:38.980 --> 08:44.940]  dry mustard, cayenne pepper, ground ginger, all reduced together. That seems pretty complicated
[08:44.940 --> 08:49.940]  and requires some cooking. Then let me read an article I read on thekitchen.com about how
[08:49.940 --> 08:55.960]  condiments aren't a one-size-fits-all item, and they went ahead and they interviewed some
[08:55.960 --> 09:00.960]  of the best chefs in the world. I'm going to pull from Barry DeCake, the chef at Scotch 8 Prime
[09:00.960 --> 09:06.820]  in the Palms Resort Casino, who says, I truly feel condiments are more than just the average ketchup,
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.240]  mustard, relish, and mayo. As a chef, I like being creative and making different sauces for topping
[09:12.240 --> 09:17.620]  sandwiches, flavored aiolis, house-made steak sauces, pickled shallot relishes, creamy mustards,
[09:17.620 --> 09:23.600]  and new spins on ketchup like Scotch infused. I also love creamy avocado dressing and seasoned
[09:23.600 --> 09:29.820]  hummus. Make it smooth, make it chunky. You're the chef, the sky is the limit with condiments.
[09:30.060 --> 09:35.860]  I thought I was the chef, but I guess I'm fucking not. I just like that your instructions start with
[09:35.860 --> 09:43.980]  put powder on the tots. Yeah, it's a weird combination. So I think you have some points,
[09:43.980 --> 09:48.540]  Geoff. I think you just worded your initial recipe terribly. It was confusing to read.
[09:48.800 --> 09:55.940]  I wasn't sure where the sauce was. This also just reads like a side. Like, are you... I didn't
[09:55.940 --> 10:00.560]  understand if you're reducing it or if you were putting this on as a topping was sort of my
[10:00.560 --> 10:04.480]  initial reaction to it. I think this sounds delicious. It sounds very gourmet. I think it
[10:04.480 --> 10:11.200]  sounds good too. We just took an issue with the format and it resulted in Geoff storming out of
[10:11.200 --> 10:17.020]  the F*** Face Slack channel. You know, we were hitting him pretty hard on the way out. At one
[10:17.020 --> 10:22.420]  point I said I would like to change my condiment. My second condiment is an Eggs Benedict.
[10:26.960 --> 10:32.260]  I think what you submitted, Geoff, would be a side version of the tater tots dish. Like you
[10:32.260 --> 10:37.060]  have your base tater tots and then you pay a dollar fifty and it comes with what you've added
[10:37.060 --> 10:42.400]  to it. I don't think this is a base condiment. Even if you, let's say, argued that it is,
[10:42.480 --> 10:47.520]  I don't think it's within the spirit of what we all submitted. I think you went very gourmet.
[10:47.940 --> 10:51.820]  I took a picture of all three sauces and they would all fit in a little plastic,
[10:52.500 --> 10:55.380]  you know, like your McDonald's sauces that you've got. They would all fit in there. I
[10:55.380 --> 11:03.960]  just don't know how you... So the people at home know Geoff has disconnected.
[11:03.960 --> 11:09.400]  I don't... He just quit. He just... He just quit.
[11:13.340 --> 11:18.060]  I'm baffled by that. Because I was going to eventually get to a point where I think Geoff
[11:18.060 --> 11:24.940]  was in the right to an extent. I think his first recipe is absurd, but I think once he clarified
[11:24.940 --> 11:30.880]  it's a cheese sauce, I think that's a fair submission. He's gone offline. But just not
[11:30.880 --> 11:36.060]  really within the spirit. I think he's off the grid now. I think this was the thing that drove
[11:36.060 --> 11:40.200]  him to go, like, live in the woods. This is it. We did it. We pushed him over the edge and he
[11:40.200 --> 11:44.640]  didn't even know we were doing it. You have to text him. You guys have... Somebody has to text
[11:44.640 --> 11:50.860]  him. Look, we have to... All these sauces were made. Sauces that seemed good. I made three
[11:50.860 --> 11:55.700]  sauces. I'm excited to try them. I got my tater tots. Uh-huh. Have you got it already? You got
[11:55.700 --> 12:00.480]  to try it live? I've pre-tried mine and I already have my verdict. But I just, I feel like Geoff's
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.440]  wouldn't fit in a little plastic pot. Well, yeah, that's mostly because it wasn't a sauce.
[12:04.700 --> 12:09.760]  Yeah, like, it's not... The tots are in there. Even if it did, like, storing a cheese sauce
[12:09.760 --> 12:14.420]  in a container seems complicated. I'm not sure, like, the logistics of, like, it not just hardening.
[12:14.980 --> 12:18.840]  I don't know how you do that unless you, like, completely manipulate the sauce to the point where
[12:18.840 --> 12:23.740]  it's no longer cheese. So do you want to... Do you want to try them live now on the episode? Yeah,
[12:23.780 --> 12:29.200]  I figured that's what we'd do. I haven't tried... I'm interested to hear your process with this.
[12:29.200 --> 12:34.640]  Should we get Geoff back? He just texted me and he said, my discord died. And I said,
[12:34.760 --> 12:40.980]  do you have internet? I mean, he did go offline. I feel like the comic value comes from just
[12:40.980 --> 12:47.520]  leaving the call. If he actually got kicked out of the recording at that time, it's absolutely
[12:47.520 --> 12:56.980]  perfect. It is a hell of a coincidence. I did not expect this episode to go like this.
[12:56.980 --> 13:02.380]  No. He, like, he, like, can't get in. He sent me a movie of just discord spinning.
[13:05.700 --> 13:09.740]  Should we do a 10 count that Geoff, like, agrees with us? Unless he could get it here in 10 seconds,
[13:09.860 --> 13:15.600]  like a wrestling thing. He's out of the ring right now. Yeah, 10 seconds. Oh, he's back. Oh,
[13:15.620 --> 13:21.140]  he's back. All right. I'm back. Sorry. Welcome back, Geoff. I lost my internet. How much money
[13:21.140 --> 13:26.800]  would it cost to make yours, Geoff? That's a great question. I feel like it's like 15 bucks worth
[13:26.800 --> 13:33.980]  of ingredients. I didn't realize there was a price limit on how much. I will say I'm on Geoff's side.
[13:34.080 --> 13:38.120]  I'm on Geoff's side with that question. That that doesn't have anything to do with a recipe. I mean,
[13:38.140 --> 13:43.300]  if you had to buy all of the ingredients, if you had to buy all of the ingredients that Andrew just
[13:43.300 --> 13:50.360]  listed, it would cost more than nacho cheese and pancetta. I guarantee you that. He had like nine
[13:50.360 --> 13:54.220]  fucking ingredients. By the way, have you guys ever read the ingredients like you were acting
[13:54.220 --> 13:58.140]  like it was overcomplicated? Have you ever read the ingredients of fucking ketchup? There's like
[13:58.140 --> 14:03.880]  11 ingredients in ketchup alone, you idiots. There's a lot. So first of all, I was confused
[14:03.880 --> 14:08.220]  by it. I never said it was bad. I've gone as far. I've said multiple times, what you submitted
[14:08.220 --> 14:14.260]  sounds delicious. I just wasn't sure if it was in the spirit of what was said. I also just didn't
[14:14.260 --> 14:20.060]  understand the first part where I need to, I will apologize to you, I missed the nacho cheese sauce
[14:20.060 --> 14:26.400]  comment. I was just baffled by the complexity of the sauce. But I made a thing yesterday,
[14:26.500 --> 14:31.340]  because sauce is confusing. I made a saucagram. I don't know if we could have a conversation about
[14:31.340 --> 14:37.660]  how we feel about this. Cheese sauce, I think, fits in the criteria of dipping sauce. It's just,
[14:38.100 --> 14:42.160]  it was complicated. So you have different tiers of sauce. You have your dressings, you have your
[14:42.160 --> 14:47.400]  sauce, and you have your dipping sauce. I think cheese sauce falls under the category of a mix
[14:47.400 --> 14:52.980]  between a sauce and a dipping sauce. I think your recipe is valid. I was just confused by the
[14:52.980 --> 14:59.240]  presentation. It was a strange interaction, I'd say. Hey, Geoff, when you said sprinkle cheese
[14:59.240 --> 15:04.800]  on the tater tots, did you think this is where it was gonna go? No, I was trying to make a delicious
[15:04.800 --> 15:10.800]  sauce that maybe, I was trying to think outside the box and do a cheese-based sauce. I thought
[15:10.800 --> 15:15.180]  that would be interesting. A lot of people, when they eat tater tots, they like to have cheddar
[15:15.180 --> 15:20.980]  cheese and bacon and all that stuff on it, and I thought, why not do the plussed-up version of
[15:20.980 --> 15:27.720]  bacon and cut up tiny little chunks of pancetta, crisp them up, and then mix them in with the
[15:27.720 --> 15:33.100]  cheese with a little chili flavoring and some minced onions that are also sauteed, much like
[15:33.100 --> 15:39.380]  a chutney, which is considered a condiment. It's an official condiment. It's a chunky chutney of
[15:39.380 --> 15:45.420]  cheese, is what I had created, that I thought was very in the spirit of, it's certainly in the
[15:45.420 --> 15:50.460]  dictionary definition of condiment, and at one point, Andrew even said, I think it sounds
[15:50.460 --> 15:54.580]  delicious, but what you've described is not a condiment, it's a sauce. So then I had to explain
[15:54.580 --> 15:59.920]  to him, so he obviously understood it as a sauce, so then I had to prove to him that a sauce is a
[15:59.920 --> 16:04.840]  condiment, and that's when he realized he had no leg to stand on. Well, it's just, I just don't feel
[16:04.840 --> 16:10.900]  like it fit the spirit of what we were doing. I didn't realize that the spirit of what we were
[16:10.900 --> 16:15.960]  doing was to combine the hard work of the Heinz Corporation with the hard work of the French's
[16:15.960 --> 16:23.160]  Corporation and then call it our thing. I tried to create, I tried to actually create, with real
[16:23.160 --> 16:28.880]  ingredients, a condiment. I didn't try to combine two fucking things that have logos on them that
[16:28.880 --> 16:33.780]  are already, that were already made in a lab by scientists into two other things, into one other
[16:33.780 --> 16:38.240]  thing, and then go, look, I invented some bullshit. To be fair, and you don't have context for this,
[16:38.300 --> 16:41.900]  this was all started because of French, which is literally just French dressing. Yeah, the original
[16:41.900 --> 16:46.700]  question was which, uh, which condiments would you mix together to make the, like, the ultimate
[16:46.700 --> 16:52.020]  condiment. Yeah, that's not what was presented to me. I think we left that bit out of the
[16:52.020 --> 16:56.300]  important intro. I think we did. I think that was the context that was maybe lacking. We were
[16:56.300 --> 17:01.000]  all thinking within that, that framework, and you came up with something very gourmet. I still don't
[17:01.000 --> 17:06.280]  think it's a sauce. I think it's a side. It's a side dish that you made. It's like, is coleslaw a salad?
[17:06.520 --> 17:11.900]  I think technically it's a salad, but you don't view it as a salad, but it is technically a salad. I think
[17:11.900 --> 17:15.840]  it's the same type of thing. Technically, you're technically correct, but I just don't think... Technically
[17:15.840 --> 17:22.580]  correct is the only correct. I'm correct in the only sense. I will say that if you came to me and
[17:22.580 --> 17:27.680]  you said, and I came to you and I said, I would like you to design the, what you think is the best salad,
[17:27.680 --> 17:32.160]  and then you came back to me with coleslaw and said, it's a salad. And I said, you are correct.
[17:32.200 --> 17:37.820]  It is a salad. And if that's what you think is the best salad, then that meets the letter of the terms
[17:37.820 --> 17:44.240]  of the competition that we had. How are we going back to Andrew making salads? I don't... Well, it's the
[17:44.240 --> 17:49.960]  coleslaw comparison. Yeah. I will say, like, where I screwed up, Geoff, is I missed the nacho cheese
[17:49.960 --> 17:54.780]  line on your second recipe submission. I didn't see the second recipe. Where was that? That was in our
[17:54.780 --> 18:02.520]  text chain. Yeah. I don't have that text. I don't think that came through on my... I don't know. I
[18:02.520 --> 18:10.180]  never know what we're talking about. That text didn't appear. Anyway, I surmise that you guys
[18:10.180 --> 18:14.440]  have created each other's sauces and are now going to test them to determine which is the best one.
[18:14.740 --> 18:21.020]  I think that's a great bit for this show. We are hammering the food stuff really hard. The audience
[18:21.020 --> 18:25.400]  is loving it. I'm loving it. So I... without further ado, I think you guys should dive right in.
[18:25.940 --> 18:31.960]  Let's get saucy. Let's get condimental. You guys did all the hard work of buying two things and
[18:31.960 --> 18:35.840]  then mixing them together with a spoon. I don't want the audience to miss out on that joy.
[18:36.340 --> 18:42.320]  Let's find out. No. The fucking thrill of combining a salad out of a mixer. That was... that was
[18:42.320 --> 18:46.820]  exciting. That's as exciting as mixing sauces. It's the same... I don't understand how this is
[18:46.820 --> 18:51.820]  different than the salad thing. I will say I tried my sauce. It's not very good. I wouldn't put my
[18:51.820 --> 18:58.180]  sauce very high. All right. Are you eating this? I'm eating the sauces right now. I'm trying them.
[18:59.760 --> 19:05.100]  I'm sorry. It's all this and you... the first thing you do after you eat your sauce is you just go,
[19:05.220 --> 19:09.600]  yeah, mine sucked. Yeah, it's not very good. I mean, I passed the torch to you guys to let you
[19:09.600 --> 19:12.780]  run with it. And that's what... that's what you did. You immediately shit on your sauce.
[19:13.020 --> 19:16.060]  I don't know what to do for you guys. Nick's sauce is delicious.
[19:16.820 --> 19:19.300]  I like Nick's sauce quite a bit. Nick, you made a great sauce.
[19:19.620 --> 19:21.780]  Okay, so you've tried yours and you've tried Nick's.
[19:21.900 --> 19:26.160]  I've tried Nick's and yeah, mine. I tried yours, Gavin. I don't know about yours, Gavin.
[19:26.460 --> 19:29.900]  I'm a little nervous. I discovered... I made a discovery with mine.
[19:31.380 --> 19:38.860]  Oh, fuck. This is... this sucks. This is way worse. Your sauce is terrible. Oh my god.
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.940]  So I accidentally made... I made like prawn cocktail sauce. I made like shrimp cocktail
[19:44.940 --> 19:50.900]  dippings. It's exactly the same. I didn't realize what I was making. It sounded good in my head.
[19:51.160 --> 19:55.940]  And then I was like, oh, this isn't... I'm not holding a shrimp. I've got a tart and it's weird.
[19:57.880 --> 20:01.320]  Nick's was, in my opinion, phenomenal. Nick's was great.
[20:01.740 --> 20:04.430]  It was like a professional sauce. Yours, Andrew, was...
[20:06.320 --> 20:12.240]  I rated yours even below mine. I would not put mine below yours. I would say
[20:13.280 --> 20:19.040]  yours... this is the difference between our sauces. They're both bad. There's a version of my sauce
[20:19.040 --> 20:23.020]  that's good. It's just not what it is. There's a combination there that you could find. I think
[20:23.020 --> 20:27.660]  there's a balance where that could be a decent sauce. Yours is what it is. I don't think there's
[20:27.660 --> 20:33.000]  any balancing of like the ingredients you have that would adjust beyond the sauce that it is.
[20:34.040 --> 20:37.280]  Yours... I think the syrup is wrecking yours, in my opinion.
[20:37.280 --> 20:43.260]  I didn't know how to... I was trying it. That was the journey of not knowing how to make sauce,
[20:43.460 --> 20:46.680]  just being an idiot and just being like, I don't like how this tastes. What can I do to
[20:46.680 --> 20:49.600]  balance this in a different way? And just constantly adding more stuff.
[20:49.980 --> 20:54.360]  For me, yours had the... it had a consistency issue, too. It was a bit more watery.
[20:54.680 --> 20:59.140]  Liquidy. Yeah, it was definitely the most liquidy of them all. Nick definitely made the best sauce,
[20:59.360 --> 21:03.320]  which I think should be expected. Can I ask a hypothetical?
[21:03.320 --> 21:06.420]  Of course. Hypothetically,
[21:07.720 --> 21:13.480]  removing Nick's sauce from the situation, just using the three hosts as their sauces.
[21:14.060 --> 21:18.560]  If you were to also make Geoff's sauce, where do you think it would have ranked compared to
[21:18.560 --> 21:22.380]  your two sauces? Probably at the top.
[21:22.540 --> 21:27.560]  Number one, yeah. I'd say that Geoff's would be the best thing. It just... yeah, by far.
[21:27.600 --> 21:30.420]  I never said it wasn't delicious. We'll never know.
[21:30.880 --> 21:32.620]  I could still make it as a side. Did you not make yours, Geoff?
[21:32.620 --> 21:36.640]  No, I was boycotting the contest. I wasn't given the other sauces to make,
[21:36.740 --> 21:38.220]  so I wasn't going to make just mine.
[21:38.480 --> 21:40.760]  Well, I was just wondering if you'd pre-tested it.
[21:41.300 --> 21:45.960]  No, I invented it on the spot. I'd never considered putting those ingredients
[21:45.960 --> 21:50.700]  together before. It was created for the moment.
[21:52.240 --> 21:53.960]  I'm going to try to make Geoff's sauce.
[21:58.790 --> 22:02.370]  This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp Online Therapy.
[22:02.370 --> 22:06.130]  Life is full of stressors, and it doesn't matter who you are or what you have.
[22:06.430 --> 22:07.790]  It's probably stressful.
[22:08.170 --> 22:13.310]  For instance, you might be a twice-divorced father of a 15-year-old daughter
[22:13.310 --> 22:18.070]  trying to survive a pandemic. That might be stressful in some way or other. Potentially.
[22:18.470 --> 22:22.290]  You might not even be feeling overly down and out or depressed right now,
[22:22.310 --> 22:25.970]  or even like you're at a total loss. But if you find that your stress is high,
[22:26.350 --> 22:28.810]  maybe your temper is a little shorter than usual,
[22:28.810 --> 22:33.830]  or even like maybe you're starting to feel strain in any of your relationships,
[22:34.370 --> 22:36.190]  you could probably use the chance to unload.
[22:36.610 --> 22:41.730]  Unload the stress. Get it out. Talk to someone who's completely unbiased about your life.
[22:42.030 --> 22:44.770]  Somebody who isn't going to judge you or take sides on anything.
[22:45.210 --> 22:49.210]  When there are things you can't tell anyone or feel like you can't unload to family and friends,
[22:49.610 --> 22:52.570]  but you do need to unload it, that's what therapy's for.
[22:52.970 --> 22:56.230]  BetterHelp is customized online therapy that offers video, phone,
[22:56.230 --> 22:58.510]  and even live chat sessions with your therapist,
[22:58.510 --> 23:01.890]  so you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.
[23:02.230 --> 23:04.190]  It's much more affordable than in-person therapy,
[23:04.370 --> 23:07.930]  and you can start communicating with your therapist in under 48 hours.
[23:08.190 --> 23:11.030]  So unload the stressors and get some unbiased feedback.
[23:11.410 --> 23:13.990]  You'd be pretty surprised at what you might gain from it.
[23:14.270 --> 23:14.990]  See if it's for you.

[23:29.530 --> 23:30.750]  Camp is in session.
[23:31.010 --> 23:34.270]  This episode of f***face is brought to you by Camp Betrayal,
[23:34.370 --> 23:38.810]  a new horror-comedy-themed reality competition for Rooster Teeth First.
[23:39.330 --> 23:43.650]  In Camp Betrayal, 12 contestants pulled from around the Rooster Teeth family
[23:43.650 --> 23:48.430]  compete for their lives by completing challenges for their evil host, the Babadour.
[23:48.630 --> 23:53.030]  And now I'm doing an ad read here, but I get to do dual duty because I'm also in this show.
[23:53.030 --> 23:58.630]  I'm the one that hires the Babadour and brings the 12 contestants together in the first place.
[23:58.710 --> 23:59.250]  But let me continue.
[23:59.410 --> 24:02.570]  In each episode, contestants are randomly chosen to lie,
[24:02.990 --> 24:06.250]  backstab, and sabotage the team's chance at success.
[24:06.470 --> 24:07.970]  But can they keep their role a secret?
[24:08.390 --> 24:09.670]  And can they survive elimination?
[24:10.370 --> 24:14.810]  Find out who's a team player and who's a betrayer every Tuesday on Rooster Teeth.
[24:14.930 --> 24:17.550]  Episode one is available for free right now.
[24:17.790 --> 24:21.270]  That's Camp Betrayal every Tuesday on Rooster Teeth.
[24:21.430 --> 24:22.430]  I'm in it.
[24:23.890 --> 24:25.890]  All right. So should we do the intro and get going?
[24:26.290 --> 24:27.570]  Yeah, let's start the episode.
[24:27.750 --> 24:28.130]  All right.
[24:31.070 --> 24:33.350]  What about outside of sauce, Geoff?
[24:33.890 --> 24:38.370]  Geoff and I, I felt like Geoff and I had a really good friendship weekend.
[24:38.930 --> 24:39.390]  Did we?
[24:39.870 --> 24:44.430]  I did. I felt that way. I felt we were... Geoff was away.
[24:44.490 --> 24:51.310]  Oh, you know what? I'm sorry. I have been so blinded by condiment rage and indignation.
[24:51.310 --> 24:53.710]  I forgot. We had a lovely...
[24:53.710 --> 24:54.650]  We had a great friendship weekend.
[24:54.870 --> 24:56.570]  We had a lovely correspondence.
[24:56.610 --> 24:56.950]  Wild.
[24:57.930 --> 25:00.390]  You are 100% right. And I apologize.
[25:02.230 --> 25:04.990]  Hockey. We gambled. We watched sports. It was fun.
[25:05.090 --> 25:08.210]  We hadn't watched like a basketball game together in a while. That was great.
[25:08.710 --> 25:10.390]  Were you on the phone with each other or just texting?
[25:10.390 --> 25:12.010]  Yeah, we're like texting back and forth.
[25:12.210 --> 25:16.850]  Yeah. Geoff had a whole betting sheet and I copied his bets. We were in it together. It was fun.
[25:17.210 --> 25:20.470]  You know, I don't gamble and I certainly don't drink anymore,
[25:20.470 --> 25:26.310]  but I do love Las Vegas for the shows and for the spectacle. And I do like to bet on sports.
[25:26.390 --> 25:31.350]  My girlfriend likes to bet on sports. And so this weekend we went to Vegas. I did a bunch of stuff.
[25:31.450 --> 25:37.850]  I got to go to a Tom Segura comedy show. I got to go to the new Meow Wolf. But the big thing for me
[25:37.850 --> 25:43.330]  was sitting in the sports book and betting on the hockey game. Oh boy, did I lose money on the
[25:44.130 --> 25:51.810]  and betting on the betting on the on the or the WCF and which I won a bunch of money on.
[25:52.050 --> 25:57.730]  And then betting on horses. I had a run. I won. I correctly bet the winner four out of
[25:57.730 --> 26:00.930]  five horse races. Holy shit. Yeah, I was I was on fire.
[26:01.310 --> 26:05.270]  I will say that the hockey bet was great because Geoff sent me what his bet was.
[26:05.290 --> 26:09.070]  And he's like, how you feel about this? And I was like, I love this bet. This is a great bet.
[26:09.070 --> 26:14.230]  I feel great about this. And that's what I do. I was fucked.
[26:14.370 --> 26:17.970]  My lot. Yeah. I accidentally put Geoff in a terrible position.
[26:18.250 --> 26:22.090]  Or no, I did with basketball on both days. I did. I fucked you on both days. I apologize.
[26:22.390 --> 26:27.270]  But I was like, this is a great bet. I love it. Montreal at home. I feel like
[26:27.270 --> 26:30.370]  they're not going to get swept. And I was right. They would win one home game,
[26:30.410 --> 26:34.810]  but it was just the wrong one. Within like 10 seconds of the game, they score a goal.
[26:34.810 --> 26:40.830]  Tapas scores on Montreal. Geoff's immediately down. I felt bad. I think by what they score
[26:40.830 --> 26:45.210]  two goals within like the first five minutes of the game. Yeah. And Andrew's going, it's OK.
[26:45.350 --> 26:50.430]  2-0 is the worst lead to have. They're bound to come back now. It's like a cliche in hockey
[26:50.430 --> 26:54.630]  that statistically isn't at all true. But it's like, yeah, 2-0 most dangerous lead.
[26:54.670 --> 26:57.670]  And then they would score another and be like, oh, now they're really in trouble. 3-0.
[26:57.930 --> 27:02.430]  You don't want that. It's a terrible lead. It was brutal. There's hope. There's hope for
[27:02.790 --> 27:06.710]  quickly faded, but then it bounced back. I don't know. Like when the horse racing run
[27:06.710 --> 27:11.210]  kicked off. I don't know when you got hot, but it was the next day. It was the next day. Yeah. OK.
[27:11.510 --> 27:16.810]  Did you have like a scheme for like what was your strategy for horse racing? You know,
[27:17.570 --> 27:24.210]  listen, a successful a successful horseman is only successful is only as successful
[27:24.210 --> 27:29.850]  as the secrets he keeps. I can't I can't mean a jockey. What's a horse? A horseman is a man
[27:29.850 --> 27:33.730]  bets on the horses. And if I let my tactics get out, then everybody's going to use them. Then the
[27:33.730 --> 27:37.490]  whole the whole horse industry might change. So I kind of I got to keep some stuff a little close
[27:37.490 --> 27:43.890]  to the vest. Fair enough. We then I put Geoff in a real dilemma, Gavin, when we bet basketball,
[27:44.110 --> 27:50.870]  because I am an amazing loser. I'm fantastic at losing sports bets. And do you expect to lose?
[27:51.730 --> 27:58.410]  Yeah. Yeah, I do. I go in when I make a bet on a sporting event. It's not about making money.
[27:58.410 --> 28:03.310]  It's about the pain of of later. Like it's the hope and pain. I'm really paying for the experience
[28:03.310 --> 28:10.050]  of disappointment mainly. And so Geoff sent me this list of like nine or 10 bets that he made. And my
[28:10.050 --> 28:15.170]  first comment was, there's no way these all lose, which is a horrible jinx. But it's just how I felt
[28:15.170 --> 28:20.430]  at the time. Then I even screwed him further, though, because I was going to match his bets
[28:20.430 --> 28:25.830]  and take all of his bets. And I said, if you want, I can fade you because I always lose. So if I bet
[28:25.830 --> 28:30.530]  the opposite of you, that might increase your odds of winning. But at this point, I've jinxed
[28:30.530 --> 28:36.750]  you. So I don't know what's worse. And Geoff just chose the great option of he wants us all to
[28:36.750 --> 28:42.130]  sink if we're sinking. You want to. So I matched his bets. Yeah. And it was positive. We won more
[28:42.130 --> 28:47.130]  than we lost on those bets. Yeah. You know what they say? A sinking tide lowers all ships. That's
[28:47.130 --> 28:54.950]  how it is. But it's not about winning, you know, it was, you know, $10, $5 bets. It's not like it's
[28:54.950 --> 29:00.970]  real money. Oh, I had. Yeah, mine was $0.10 per NBA bet. But I think I think mine were $5 bets.
[29:02.610 --> 29:07.390]  But it's more just like the fun of doing it. And just like and honestly, half of the reason why I
[29:07.390 --> 29:11.750]  like to do it is to sit in that like sports room with all the TVs and just watch the fucking
[29:11.750 --> 29:17.070]  weirdos that come in. Oh, that's like it is great. It's like a bus station in there. Just the people
[29:17.070 --> 29:23.330]  that meander through. It's an interesting cross section of humanity. So I I've never been on
[29:23.330 --> 29:29.010]  horses, but I feel like my my horse betting philosophy would be the same as my child picking
[29:29.010 --> 29:36.750]  philosophy for the city. Child kicking, child picking, not child. I've never said I've never
[29:36.750 --> 29:41.310]  kicked the child. I never would. But my child. Did you hear that? Man, that's it. That was close
[29:41.310 --> 29:46.410]  to an admission. It wasn't even close. I said picking. It was very clear. You can hear on my
[29:46.410 --> 29:51.610]  audio distinctly clear child picking. Today is one of my favorite days of the year. It is like
[29:51.610 --> 29:56.990]  a holiday to me. This is the day. I'm so excited. This is child picking day. Yesterday was child
[29:56.990 --> 30:03.370]  picking day, Geoff. This is the event for the child picking today is Scripps National Spelling
[30:03.370 --> 30:10.070]  Bee. What a time. What an exciting process. I watch it every year. It's how my fantasy football
[30:10.070 --> 30:15.370]  league determines our draft order. So everybody picks a kid. There was a whole process. I didn't
[30:15.370 --> 30:19.810]  get my number one on the board. I was outraged about it. I was very pissed. I got my number
[30:19.810 --> 30:25.450]  two, though. So I believe I got some hope. But tonight is the spelling bee. And so the order
[30:25.450 --> 30:29.690]  in which the kids are eliminated determined the picking order for our league. So tonight,
[30:29.790 --> 30:34.970]  I'll be in a group chat with 11 other people who are all in their 30s, adults, being irrationally
[30:34.970 --> 30:41.070]  furious at kids spelling. Cannot wait. It's one of my favorite days of the year. The oldest you
[30:41.070 --> 30:46.330]  can be for Scripps National Spelling Bee is 14 years old. Most of them are like 12. So it's like
[30:46.330 --> 30:51.810]  all these adults just angrily watching 12 year olds try to spell. So where are you in the
[30:51.810 --> 30:57.910]  kicking order? What do you mean in the kicking order? The picking order. Picking order?
[30:59.950 --> 31:05.430]  No, no, I'm here. I'm here. Well, I picked a child named Vincia.
[31:05.890 --> 31:10.690]  Wasn't who I wanted. What I was getting to at the point, I feel like I really want... I forget
[31:10.690 --> 31:15.230]  his name. There was one child who was sponsored by the Carolina Panthers, which I've never seen
[31:15.230 --> 31:20.970]  before. It's always like another spelling bee or a newspaper. There is one guy that's just like,
[31:21.050 --> 31:25.570]  no, Carolina Panthers. And since we're doing a fantasy football thing, it's like, this is destiny.
[31:25.830 --> 31:33.010]  Got to go with that. Can we sponsor a... That's such a great idea. I don't know how that works.
[31:33.050 --> 31:38.230]  I'd love to. That'd be great. We must be able to try and do that. How do you... I'll have to look
[31:38.230 --> 31:41.990]  into this, but I'd love that. If we save up our weekly episode budget, like pocket money,
[31:41.990 --> 31:49.850]  by next year we might have enough. I feel like we are the coins that fall in the couch
[31:49.850 --> 31:55.050]  of like the overall... That's the budget. Like whatever coins happen to fall through.
[31:56.530 --> 32:01.990]  Whatever... Assuming the person that we pick doesn't win, whatever word they misspell to
[32:01.990 --> 32:06.530]  get out on, we should just make that a shirt. Oh, absolutely. A misspelled shirt.
[32:07.230 --> 32:09.250]  That's how we recoup our investment.
[32:13.010 --> 32:17.050]  Well, I'd recoup it just personally on joy. I guess it's not my investment, but...
[32:17.050 --> 32:18.610]  The word is condiment.
[32:19.590 --> 32:21.030]  The word is honey mustard.
[32:21.930 --> 32:22.830]  It's two words.
[32:23.250 --> 32:28.970]  That is true. That was a bad example. It's a terrible example, but it's great. I would
[32:28.970 --> 32:32.030]  recommend you both watch the scripts of National Spelling Bee tonight.
[32:32.050 --> 32:33.870]  How on earth do I watch that?
[32:34.150 --> 32:35.010]  It's on ESPN.
[32:35.010 --> 32:37.650]  Like I buy television to see that?
[32:38.030 --> 32:40.890]  I guess. Yeah. Do you have no television watching options?
[32:41.130 --> 32:41.370]  No.
[32:41.950 --> 32:44.270]  Okay. Well, then I guess I don't know how you'd watch it, but...
[32:44.270 --> 32:45.770]  Maybe if you watch it, you could just...
[32:46.350 --> 32:50.690]  I'll live text you. Yeah. I'll keep you updated on how the bitch is doing.
[32:51.650 --> 32:53.570]  That's my evening. How about you guys?
[32:54.570 --> 32:56.570]  What am I going to do tonight?
[32:57.070 --> 32:59.030]  Yeah. Just what's happening.
[32:59.890 --> 33:01.970]  You seem very defeated today, Geoff.
[33:01.970 --> 33:08.910]  Well, listen, it's been a week and it's been a day. Tonight, I'm going to go host First
[33:08.910 --> 33:10.250]  Night for RTX.
[33:10.330 --> 33:10.790]  Oh, shit.
[33:11.050 --> 33:11.250]  Yeah.
[33:11.450 --> 33:12.070]  That's exciting.
[33:12.690 --> 33:16.010]  As soon as I'm done here, I'm going to go do that. So yay.
[33:16.630 --> 33:17.330]  That's great.
[33:18.570 --> 33:19.170]  What about you, Gavin?
[33:20.670 --> 33:21.930]  I'm playing board games.
[33:22.610 --> 33:22.910]  Yay.
[33:23.670 --> 33:24.630]  What board games are you playing?
[33:25.890 --> 33:26.210]  Bye.
[33:26.870 --> 33:27.110]  What?
[33:28.970 --> 33:30.730]  This episode is just so weird.
[33:31.450 --> 33:33.910]  Andrew asked, what board games are you playing? And you just said, bye.
[33:33.910 --> 33:35.350]  Yeah, you just said, bye.
[33:35.850 --> 33:36.750]  I'm playing Pandemic.
[33:37.150 --> 33:39.430]  I've never played that game. I haven't either.
[33:41.510 --> 33:42.470]  Have you played it before?
[33:43.890 --> 33:46.730]  Yeah, I've started like a legacy. We're like two rounds in.
[33:47.070 --> 33:48.030]  I don't know what that means.
[33:48.510 --> 33:51.810]  Yeah, it's a co-op game. It's like teamwork. It's good. It's good so far.
[33:52.270 --> 33:54.170]  Are you a board game guy?
[33:54.490 --> 33:58.590]  I'm becoming a board game guy. I feel like I've only recently discovered that board games
[33:58.590 --> 34:02.270]  can be like video games in the way that they're interesting.
[34:03.030 --> 34:06.490]  Because I think of board games, I just think of like Monopoly and Mousetrap and shit.
[34:06.630 --> 34:07.370]  And it's just like, ugh.
[34:07.870 --> 34:08.910]  Yeah, no, they're better than that.
[34:08.910 --> 34:11.170]  There's some good stuff out there. There's some stuff that takes like
[34:11.670 --> 34:14.510]  12 hours to finish and stuff over like multiple segments.
[34:15.090 --> 34:18.530]  Are you shitting on Clue? Clue is a great board game.
[34:18.650 --> 34:18.970]  You're a fool.
[34:20.110 --> 34:22.770]  You don't think Clue is a great board game? It's a murder mystery.
[34:23.270 --> 34:24.150]  I hate that game.
[34:24.510 --> 34:28.250]  What do you hate about Clue? Oh, you get a notepad. You can ask questions. It's great.
[34:28.250 --> 34:33.830]  Clue is never as fun as it promises to be. It's frustrating. I want Clue to be better
[34:33.830 --> 34:34.510]  every time I play it.
[34:34.550 --> 34:36.750]  It's a game where the box looks more interesting than the game.
[34:37.090 --> 34:37.330]  Yeah.
[34:37.990 --> 34:41.430]  Well, OK. I had a pretty cool Clue box. It was made out of wood.
[34:42.550 --> 34:45.530]  So I don't know if that's a fair comparison. It was a pretty sweet box.
[34:45.610 --> 34:48.850]  It'd be tough for any game to live up to the design of the box I had for Clue.
[34:49.370 --> 34:51.250]  Geoff, do you remember the English name for Clue?
[34:51.550 --> 34:52.870]  Cluedo. Action man.
[34:52.910 --> 34:54.310]  Cluedo. Cluedo.
[34:54.310 --> 34:57.970]  And listen, by the way, I'm not talking shit about Clue,
[34:58.130 --> 35:00.230]  but I am acknowledging the limitations of Clue.
[35:00.310 --> 35:04.090]  I'm a fan of Clue. I consider myself a Cluniac, as we call ourselves.
[35:05.110 --> 35:09.050]  I've been trying to get a Clue tentpole show like Hardcore Monopoly,
[35:09.150 --> 35:10.770]  Hardcore Clue made at Rooster Teeth for years.
[35:11.090 --> 35:16.150]  But I have to agree with Gavin that it under delivers when you sit down to play it.
[35:16.510 --> 35:21.690]  You know what I think it is? I haven't ventured into the actual complex adult board games.
[35:22.250 --> 35:28.630]  Like the pandemics of the world. I haven't played that. I'm really restricted to Monopoly,
[35:29.310 --> 35:32.830]  the classic favorites. So my comparables is like Candyland is bullshit,
[35:33.350 --> 35:37.250]  but my peak is something like Clue. So I just think I have a narrow range.
[35:37.670 --> 35:42.050]  Sounds like we need to get you involved. We need to have a board game night when we go up to Canada.
[35:42.490 --> 35:45.170]  Maybe that'll be the reward if we can find your front door.
[35:45.350 --> 35:48.710]  Man, the list of shit we've got to do when we arrive in Canada is getting really long.
[35:48.890 --> 35:49.850]  Yeah, we're gonna be very busy.
[35:51.270 --> 35:55.050]  Maybe while like the Bondo is drying on our bathtub...
[35:58.270 --> 36:00.890]  boat, we can hammer out a game of Clue.
[36:00.910 --> 36:01.870]  Is that on again this year?
[36:02.310 --> 36:02.630]  I don't...
[36:02.630 --> 36:03.150]  It already happened.
[36:03.530 --> 36:04.330]  Oh, it happened?
[36:04.530 --> 36:05.370]  I think it was last month.
[36:05.930 --> 36:09.510]  It happens in July typically, but it would be weird if you know...
[36:09.510 --> 36:11.590]  Everything has been shut down here, so I'd be surprised.
[36:12.270 --> 36:14.550]  Maybe next year. Maybe 2022 is our bath year.
[36:14.810 --> 36:18.330]  It's gonna have to be next year because I feel like the audience alerted me to the fact that
[36:18.330 --> 36:19.050]  it happened already.
[36:20.710 --> 36:24.450]  Famous Nanaimo bathtub race cancelled on June 5th, 2021.
[36:24.850 --> 36:26.330]  Did they also cancel the cheese rolling?
[36:26.590 --> 36:27.990]  Didn't you like pick the cheese or something?
[36:28.670 --> 36:30.810]  Yes, there was a whole cheese thing.
[36:30.930 --> 36:31.690]  That was season one.
[36:31.950 --> 36:32.430]  That was the only time.
[36:32.950 --> 36:34.670]  Yeah, that never happened, sadly.
[36:35.190 --> 36:37.050]  I think we should go to that at some point.
[36:37.110 --> 36:37.990]  We should go to cheese rolling.
[36:38.310 --> 36:39.770]  Could we sponsor a cheese?
[36:39.930 --> 36:41.930]  Could that be like the later thing?
[36:42.190 --> 36:43.550]  Is this evolution of f***face?
[36:43.610 --> 36:44.810]  We just start sponsoring things?
[36:44.830 --> 36:47.750]  Just see the f***face logo tumbling down a hill.
[36:48.050 --> 36:48.230]  Yeah.
[36:49.250 --> 36:53.110]  I think we gotta slowly build to like an actual fast sport.
[36:53.370 --> 36:57.510]  Like we're gonna start with the cheese and then we're gonna go to the bathtub race and
[36:57.510 --> 37:00.690]  then maybe eventually, I don't know, a car sponsor.
[37:00.970 --> 37:03.270]  And then we've got the f***face sponsored kid.
[37:03.710 --> 37:06.050]  I think we should just sponsor the weirdest stuff.
[37:06.470 --> 37:07.150]  I would love that.
[37:07.630 --> 37:11.270]  There's nothing I love more than like getting into a thing that I know nothing about,
[37:11.590 --> 37:13.090]  especially if I can gamble on it.
[37:13.350 --> 37:14.610]  Like Russian handball?
[37:14.610 --> 37:18.530]  Yeah, like handball was like such a fun two weeks of like getting in.
[37:18.590 --> 37:19.730]  I've never watched it again.
[37:19.850 --> 37:23.230]  I followed the Brazilian goalie on Twitter because their performance was amazing.
[37:23.730 --> 37:24.630]  Ridiculously talented.
[37:25.090 --> 37:26.370]  I'll never think about handball again.
[37:26.450 --> 37:28.650]  But yeah, we could get into weird sports.
[37:29.010 --> 37:29.730]  I'm all about it.
[37:29.950 --> 37:31.550]  I got a question for you guys.
[37:31.870 --> 37:32.110]  Okay.
[37:32.330 --> 37:38.110]  As of today, I now have 100 full-size baseball bats.
[37:41.650 --> 37:45.050]  900 bat knobs on my kitchen table for some reason.
[37:45.690 --> 37:47.930]  And a thousand little metal tags.
[37:48.170 --> 37:49.410]  Wait, you got 900?
[37:49.930 --> 37:50.810]  You have 900 bat knobs?
[37:50.830 --> 37:54.290]  And I ask you guys, what the f*** am I supposed to do with all this stuff?
[37:54.410 --> 37:56.410]  I genuinely don't remember.
[37:56.710 --> 37:58.630]  Where did the 900 knobs come from?
[37:58.910 --> 38:00.430]  I thought, I don't know.
[38:00.510 --> 38:03.390]  I don't know why the knobs ended up at my house.
[38:03.830 --> 38:06.970]  I was thinking about that yesterday when I was dragging them in from the front porch.
[38:06.970 --> 38:10.310]  Because I don't know that I was ever supposed to do anything with them.
[38:10.450 --> 38:12.510]  If you've already got knobs, why are you cutting up bats?
[38:13.030 --> 38:15.470]  Well, I think the point, and I'm trying to remember.
[38:15.610 --> 38:23.470]  But I think the point was that a hundred of the knobs would be made with love from me.
[38:23.650 --> 38:23.810]  Right?
[38:23.970 --> 38:29.290]  Like, kind of like how we signed, how I burned 50 bats, but not the other 250 or whatever.
[38:29.650 --> 38:31.130]  So this would be that version of that.
[38:31.270 --> 38:34.750]  And then, if I remember correctly, there was the idea that we would metal tag
[38:35.130 --> 38:38.090]  the end of the knob that I cut with the end of the bat,
[38:38.230 --> 38:40.190]  so that they could be synced up again someday.
[38:40.950 --> 38:41.990]  Am I remembering that correctly?
[38:42.410 --> 38:45.790]  Yeah, well, I remember that part, but I don't remember there being a bunch of other knobs.
[38:45.890 --> 38:48.550]  I thought the whole point of knobs was that they couldn't get made right,
[38:48.650 --> 38:49.450]  and you were going to make them.
[38:49.730 --> 38:51.870]  Well, then they found that they could make the knobs.
[38:52.110 --> 38:53.010]  They found a knob vendor.
[38:53.170 --> 38:54.610]  But then they were like, we already ordered the bats,
[38:54.730 --> 38:58.570]  and you can still do the thing where you cut the bats in half, and that's fine.
[38:59.370 --> 39:01.770]  Okay, so you might get a GeoffCut knob.
[39:01.770 --> 39:06.210]  Well, you're going to tell because the knobs are very fucking different, first of all.
[39:06.690 --> 39:09.890]  But secondly, I thought the idea was that then I would take these tags,
[39:10.010 --> 39:12.050]  and I would put like tag number one on this knob,
[39:12.410 --> 39:13.970]  tag number one on this bat end,
[39:14.010 --> 39:15.730]  and then you could put one and one together and be like,
[39:15.790 --> 39:17.030]  oh, we found our match or whatever,
[39:17.310 --> 39:20.550]  even though we don't necessarily know what we're going to do with the other half of the bats yet.
[39:20.690 --> 39:23.750]  But I got a thousand metal tags.
[39:24.430 --> 39:26.990]  And I don't have number one through a thousand.
[39:27.450 --> 39:29.230]  So there's no way for me to sync up.
[39:29.530 --> 39:31.170]  I don't have two of the same tag.
[39:31.770 --> 39:38.430]  And I certainly wasn't planning on just putting a metal tag on every knob of the other 900 knobs.
[39:38.730 --> 39:44.150]  So I think what I need is one to a hundred and then one to a hundred again in tags.
[39:44.370 --> 39:46.230]  I don't think I need two hundred to a thousand.
[39:46.810 --> 39:50.230]  I think those are useless, but they exist, and I'm just fucking confused.
[39:50.310 --> 39:53.710]  So I think I have some of what I need and way too much of other stuff,
[39:53.930 --> 39:56.190]  but none of it is getting this shit out of my house.
[39:56.190 --> 40:02.670]  So I'm a wash in bats and wood, and I'm befuddled as to what to do about it.
[40:02.890 --> 40:07.750]  Why don't you just put the metal tags on all the knobs, one to a thousand, and then...
[40:07.750 --> 40:13.710]  Well, if I had made the metal tags, I would have made them to fit the knobs.
[40:14.110 --> 40:14.950]  Do they not fit?
[40:15.910 --> 40:17.210]  Not as such.
[40:17.870 --> 40:21.810]  So you could always get the ones that are from the bats that you cut,
[40:22.190 --> 40:25.030]  and then just sharpie number the bats as you go.
[40:25.510 --> 40:27.890]  So like, metal tag match with sharpie.
[40:28.390 --> 40:31.590]  Yeah, or I could make them make another round of metal tags, one to a hundred.
[40:31.790 --> 40:33.090]  I don't know. I just...
[40:33.090 --> 40:36.770]  All of this is to say that, like, I don't want it in my house.
[40:37.250 --> 40:38.570]  My girlfriend's very kind.
[40:39.130 --> 40:40.270]  Sorry, I kicked half my desk over.
[40:41.070 --> 40:44.050]  My girlfriend's very kind, but I'm pretty sure she doesn't want it.
[40:44.090 --> 40:47.230]  I mean, it's taken up half of my library and my entire kitchen table,
[40:47.890 --> 40:50.310]  and I don't even have the tools required to...
[40:50.850 --> 40:52.010]  I just don't know what to do.
[40:52.710 --> 40:56.010]  I'm frozen. I'm frozen with bat indecision.
[40:56.610 --> 41:01.390]  I feel like, much like my sauce, they didn't even know what to do.
[41:02.010 --> 41:04.870]  There's like seven different bat ideas that we've suggested,
[41:05.110 --> 41:08.230]  and they've all kind of... you've gotten all of them, but like part of each one.
[41:08.450 --> 41:09.930]  Like, it's just a mix of things.
[41:10.390 --> 41:12.570]  Yeah, I don't think I have a complete set of anything.
[41:12.910 --> 41:13.070]  Yeah.
[41:13.170 --> 41:13.410]  No.
[41:14.870 --> 41:19.510]  All right, well, I'm just gonna ignore it for a little bit longer, then, I guess.
[41:20.130 --> 41:20.950]  Do you have no plan?
[41:20.950 --> 41:23.510]  You're just gonna... it's a future Geoff problem?
[41:23.970 --> 41:26.030]  I mean, today Geoff isn't gonna fix it.
[41:26.150 --> 41:27.190]  Today Geoff has to go do...
[41:27.830 --> 41:30.490]  The current Geoff has to deal with RTX all week and all weekend,
[41:30.910 --> 41:33.270]  so I'm certainly not gonna touch it now.
[41:33.470 --> 41:36.070]  So I can't even think about it till after RTX is over.
[41:36.670 --> 41:40.090]  So it's a problem for 10 days from now, Geoff, I guess.
[41:40.430 --> 41:41.050]  Do you have a garage?
[41:41.550 --> 41:41.910]  No.
[41:42.710 --> 41:49.490]  I have a little house in the back that's tiny where I put my bikes and my lawnmower,
[41:49.490 --> 41:52.610]  but it doesn't... it's not suitable for this.
[41:52.610 --> 41:53.130]  No good bat storage?
[41:53.330 --> 41:55.110]  No, it's not good bat storage. I wouldn't want to put them there.
[41:55.550 --> 41:56.970]  It's not climate controlled or anything.
[41:57.110 --> 42:00.010]  I wouldn't want the bats to swell with humidity or anything.
[42:02.250 --> 42:04.250]  What if we kept sending you bats?
[42:04.690 --> 42:05.090]  What's up?
[42:05.450 --> 42:08.990]  What if we just kept sending you bats? What if bats just kept appearing?
[42:09.250 --> 42:12.130]  I hope they don't. I'd like to... I'd like to remove...
[42:12.950 --> 42:16.750]  Well, I'll be honest with you, I'd like to get rid of all of the bats I have right now.
[42:17.030 --> 42:19.290]  I'd like to remove all of the bats.
[42:19.490 --> 42:24.810]  You take the bats and you construct a Game of Thrones-esque seat out of them
[42:24.810 --> 42:27.370]  with all the spare parts that you saw off.
[42:28.070 --> 42:28.150]  Yeah.
[42:28.250 --> 42:29.270]  I like that a lot.
[42:29.870 --> 42:30.910]  The bat throne.
[42:32.930 --> 42:36.310]  Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take all those parts and I'm gonna dump them off in your
[42:36.310 --> 42:40.270]  front yard and I'm gonna let you make it. Your idea, you can do it.
[42:41.210 --> 42:42.930]  Oh shit, well how would I even do that? Nails?
[42:42.930 --> 42:44.910]  I don't know. Same way I would probably do it.
[42:44.950 --> 42:47.330]  You got a bunch of those already. They come with the set.
[42:47.330 --> 42:49.190]  Got all the nails you need apparently.
[42:49.610 --> 42:53.010]  No, there's no nails. That's the... this thing too that I thought...
[42:54.110 --> 42:58.610]  I thought the tags were gonna be like... that I could like tack on with a little...
[42:58.610 --> 42:58.670]  Yeah.
[42:58.830 --> 43:03.470]  With a little... but they're not. They're like adhesive in some way and you come with a roller
[43:03.470 --> 43:08.270]  where you have to like roll, like press roll it on, which is fine if it's a flat surface,
[43:08.430 --> 43:09.690]  but these are all beveled.
[43:11.350 --> 43:16.170]  I feel like someone just listened to our conversations and then just started buying stuff.
[43:16.170 --> 43:21.690]  Listen to... yeah, listen. I realize that in most cases...
[43:22.790 --> 43:27.170]  I'll go so far as to say that in every instance of my life I've been at fault.
[43:27.550 --> 43:35.290]  So it's probably my fault in some way, but I'll be damned if I know how to unfuck it right now.
[43:35.470 --> 43:37.810]  So yeah, we'll deal with it. Future Geoff will deal with it I guess,
[43:37.890 --> 43:40.950]  but if anybody has any ideas, send them my way.
[43:41.150 --> 43:44.930]  Don't send them to the f***face slack. I'm no longer able to receive messages on that,
[43:44.930 --> 43:48.770]  but you both have my phone, I believe, still.
[43:50.750 --> 43:54.210]  I don't know if you can reach me on social media. I'm not sure we're following each other anymore,
[43:54.670 --> 43:57.950]  but you definitely have my phone number so you can text me.
[43:59.630 --> 44:04.370]  I don't... I really... like the tags not being nailable. I feel like that was such a key part
[44:04.370 --> 44:08.270]  of that conversation. I was really imagining like almost railroad spikes,
[44:08.770 --> 44:11.450]  but like a marker that you would... yeah, okay.
[44:11.450 --> 44:20.290]  Or like if you've ever seen a... well, anyway, a tiny little attack. But yeah, it's frustrating.
[44:20.910 --> 44:24.250]  That being said, I'm sure it'll... when it's all said and done,
[44:24.310 --> 44:28.310]  I'm sure it'll be a hilarious product that the comment leavers will find hilarious.
[44:29.750 --> 44:33.550]  The comment leavers have been sending in their diagrams of the room.
[44:33.670 --> 44:36.570]  They have. Some of them have been shockingly good.
[44:36.670 --> 44:39.990]  We've already dealt with that recording-wise, but they're pretty accurate, some of them.
[44:39.990 --> 44:46.010]  I saw one that was more accurate than mine. It was like perfect in every way, which was phenomenal.
[44:46.590 --> 44:50.650]  Yeah, I mean you... you guys get extra points, like you were attempting to place things like
[44:50.650 --> 44:53.950]  the sushi container and all that. I think there's one I saw where it like nailed the
[44:53.950 --> 44:58.110]  rooms and everything, but they didn't really predict. The sushi container seems to be the
[44:58.110 --> 45:01.110]  thing that throws people. They do not know where to place that in the overall room.
[45:01.530 --> 45:02.210]  Where was that?
[45:03.190 --> 45:06.450]  That was in front of the fridge. That was next to the fridge,
[45:06.470 --> 45:08.010]  and people are putting it on the other side.
[45:08.230 --> 45:09.450]  Oh, I think that's where I put it, isn't it?
[45:09.890 --> 45:12.770]  I think you did. I think you were in the group that put it on the other side.
[45:13.870 --> 45:16.170]  I did try to go to my bathroom. Nick just said,
[45:16.230 --> 45:19.050]  didn't you trip on one in the bathroom? No, it wasn't in the bathroom. It was on the way.
[45:19.190 --> 45:24.690]  I was going to the bathroom. I just got AirPods. I was very excited. It was late at night, and
[45:25.650 --> 45:31.370]  I stepped on a plastic container. Took a fall. Hard fall. Maybe the hardest fall of my life.
[45:31.770 --> 45:34.510]  I'm impressed, though. It was a great landing. It was like a stuntman landing,
[45:35.030 --> 45:38.930]  square on the shoulders. Could not figure out why my back was sore, though, the next day.
[45:40.750 --> 45:45.790]  But I had a point. I don't know what my point was. I've lost. I was talking about sushi containers.
[45:46.270 --> 45:47.750]  How close are we to a marathon at this point?
[45:48.170 --> 45:54.130]  Oh, not close. Not close. We keep re-aggravating. Keep getting worse.
[45:56.670 --> 46:00.350]  That's what I was going to say. People were commenting on, like, where's the shimmy
[46:00.890 --> 46:04.830]  of the thing? And I forgot about... I had the filing cabinet in front of the bed,
[46:04.830 --> 46:09.750]  and I had a TV on the other side of it. I can't believe I did that for so long.
[46:10.170 --> 46:12.770]  You had the filing cabinet, the one that's next to the dresser?
[46:13.050 --> 46:18.590]  I had that in front of the bed, because that was one of the key components of the
[46:19.190 --> 46:20.790]  fort I made. The blanket fort.
[46:20.950 --> 46:23.890]  What do you mean, in front of the bed? So, when you were in bed, you looked at your feet,
[46:24.010 --> 46:25.790]  and there was the back of a filing cabinet there?
[46:25.990 --> 46:31.470]  Yep. Exactly. That's exactly what it was, because that was the pillar. That was a pillar for the
[46:31.470 --> 46:36.610]  fort. Remember when we were first in the setup, I had to set up a blanket fort whenever we recorded.
[46:36.610 --> 46:39.110]  So, where was the shimmy? Between the filing cabinet and the desk?
[46:39.530 --> 46:45.310]  No, it was to the wall. So, I have a 50-inch TV I'm no longer using that's, like, an old,
[46:45.390 --> 46:50.110]  and it's bulky, but I was playing PS2, and it was the only thing that it would work with. So,
[46:50.130 --> 46:55.750]  I pulled it out, and I just put it on the floor across from... There's a little wall between the
[46:55.750 --> 47:00.630]  closet and the bathroom, and it was there, but it was lined up with the filing cabinet. So,
[47:00.630 --> 47:07.950]  I had to shimmy past that whenever I needed to go by. It was annoying, but I forgot all about it.
[47:08.270 --> 47:08.370]  That's crazy.
[47:08.370 --> 47:11.190]  Well, yeah, it's just, you know, people, like, listening to previous episodes and bringing
[47:11.190 --> 47:12.590]  up that I talked about shimmying.
[47:12.830 --> 47:16.290]  Do you have anything else in your life right now that's, like, you know is really inconvenient,
[47:16.450 --> 47:20.730]  you just need to deal with it, and it'll take, like, 10 seconds and save you hours and hours of
[47:20.730 --> 47:21.490]  annoyance?
[47:22.830 --> 47:29.510]  Oh, that's a good... I don't... Not really, but those things for me, typically, I just don't deal
[47:29.510 --> 47:33.390]  with, and it just creates more anxiety, even though I know it's not a problem. You know,
[47:33.430 --> 47:37.130]  like, it's like, oh, I could just quickly do this, but then I don't, because it just seems like a
[47:37.130 --> 47:41.050]  minor thing, and then it just builds. It takes me forever to resolve this.
[47:41.330 --> 47:43.890]  I have something that would take 10 seconds to clean up,
[47:44.290 --> 47:48.290]  but I've just been staring at it for about a year, and I refuse to deal with it at this point.
[47:48.690 --> 47:53.610]  And it isn't inconvenient, it's just very annoying to look at. I put up a shelf about a year ago,
[47:53.730 --> 47:58.190]  and I, like, drilled in the wall, and it made, like, wall dust fall down and land on the
[47:58.190 --> 48:03.090]  skirting board. And it's just still there, and I could easily just go and grab the vacuum right
[48:03.090 --> 48:07.570]  now and suck it up. Why don't you do it right now while we're on in the podcast? I'm encouraging
[48:07.570 --> 48:12.610]  you to do it. Let's... I want to hear it. Could this be the time? We're gonna make your life
[48:12.610 --> 48:17.330]  better right now, through the power of f***face. The thing is, I just... I feel like I only ever
[48:17.330 --> 48:21.330]  see it while I'm, like, walking from one thing to another. Like, I'm gonna go and get something,
[48:21.390 --> 48:25.850]  or I'm going out, and I'm just like, that thing again! I keep walking by it. Yeah, I could just
[48:25.850 --> 48:30.610]  do it now, couldn't I? It's top of mind right now. By the power of f***face, I compel you to
[48:30.610 --> 48:35.550]  clean this mess. All right. Are we gonna be able to go with him? Are we just here? Is it just us?
[48:35.670 --> 48:38.990]  I think it's just you and I, but let's... let's see if we can... do you... let's see if we can
[48:38.990 --> 48:44.490]  hear him, uh, in the background while he's doing it. Uh, what else going on in your world, Andrew?
[48:45.030 --> 48:48.990]  Have you anything you need to clean right now? I have a thing I want to talk about,
[48:49.030 --> 48:52.130]  but it is sort of extensive. I don't know if we have time within this episode.
[48:52.130 --> 48:54.070]  So I still have a thing...
[49:04.990 --> 49:08.230]  That's a lot of sawdust. That's taking a lot of sawdust. That's a lot of sawdust!
[49:08.270 --> 49:11.430]  I don't... you made it sound like it was just like you'd run your finger over it,
[49:11.490 --> 49:17.110]  it would be gone. Yeah. It was a long, long vacuum. All right, we're good. It's all right.
[49:17.330 --> 49:20.750]  How does that feel? Oh, that feels good. That feels good. Does it?
[49:20.750 --> 49:25.550]  I'm glad you compelled me to do that in the middle of a recording. You're never... you're
[49:25.550 --> 49:28.970]  gonna walk... the next time you're gonna forget about this very quickly, and then the next time
[49:28.970 --> 49:32.350]  you walk through it, you're gonna look over there and it's gonna be gone, and you're gonna... your
[49:32.350 --> 49:37.070]  heart's gonna smile a tiny little bit. Yeah. I'll be taking the bins out, I'll be walking by just
[49:37.070 --> 49:41.970]  be like... yeah. Your life just got better, man. Do you have anything that you're putting off like
[49:41.970 --> 49:48.370]  that? Something really easy to fix, but it's just so far down on priority, you'll realistically
[49:48.370 --> 49:53.950]  never get to it. I feel like you have something for me. Are you aware of something that I have
[49:53.950 --> 49:57.370]  that I'm not... that I'm ignoring, or? No, this is... I don't think this is paranoia thing,
[49:57.530 --> 50:01.910]  Geoff. I think he's just asking. Oh. Do you think I've laid some inconvenience in your house?
[50:02.210 --> 50:08.110]  I don't know. Yeah, well, I wouldn't put a pass yet, but... Oh, come on. Well, I don't... I just,
[50:08.750 --> 50:15.550]  you know, don't... I don't trust any of you at all anymore. I had a great prank to do against you,
[50:15.550 --> 50:18.990]  Geoff, but I just don't... I don't think I could put it together. But I think you'd even like it.
[50:19.110 --> 50:25.410]  I almost texted Gavin it today. Yeah, it's fine. Do whatever. I don't care. Just prank away.
[50:26.150 --> 50:30.570]  Well, no, it's just... I think... Did you know that you could... so we like... Don't spoil it.
[50:30.750 --> 50:34.470]  Don't spoil it. It's gonna be a hilarious prank. No, I don't think it'll ever actually happen.
[50:34.570 --> 50:39.290]  It's too elaborate. But it's just... it's an amusing idea. I didn't know this. Did you know
[50:39.290 --> 50:43.750]  that you could get games graded? Like a card? Like there's a company that you could send? I didn't
[50:43.750 --> 50:48.150]  realize that. So I was thinking about like, well, what is the range in which you could get things
[50:48.150 --> 50:52.730]  graded? I was wondering, could I get my BTS sauces graded? Could I find a place that would like...
[50:52.730 --> 50:58.070]  could I get... could I get 10 mint? Yeah, they're sealed. I want to try to get a 10 mint BTS of each one.
[50:58.510 --> 51:04.530]  And then I thought, well, what if like Geoff went away and we just fucking... we graded every item
[51:04.530 --> 51:08.830]  in his house? Like you come back in and everything's just surrounded in a hard plastic shell
[51:08.830 --> 51:14.690]  like different. This is a 9.7. The fridge is gonna get an F. The fridge is definitely gonna score
[51:14.690 --> 51:21.170]  loud. That fucking fridge. Dude, my life is... You still have fridge problems? You got fridge news?
[51:22.110 --> 51:29.710]  No. Well, no. No. I mean, it's the same as always. It's just... Dark fridge. Dark fridge.
[51:30.590 --> 51:35.310]  It's expensive. I don't have the money to fix it right now. Or I don't... it's not that I don't
[51:35.310 --> 51:39.590]  I just don't want to spend the money to replace it. And it's so expensive. And I'm so
[51:40.410 --> 51:46.850]  mired in other shit. It's just... what's the point? Here's how it works, right? So, you know,
[51:46.890 --> 51:51.190]  maybe we should just talk about my shitty story next episode. We're supposed to wrap up, right?
[51:51.750 --> 51:55.210]  Sure. Yeah. I mean, we're close to an hour. We could wrap up.
[51:55.490 --> 51:58.230]  Yep. Eric says we should wrap. Are we doing two today?
[51:58.690 --> 52:00.670]  We're doing two. I think we're doing two. Yeah.
[52:00.950 --> 52:03.590]  Oh my God. I got stuff for two.
[52:05.390 --> 52:08.670]  I didn't get to any of my stuff for this episode. It was so weird.
[52:08.870 --> 52:15.830]  My whole goal in this episode was to not talk about the condiment stuff and to not let you guys
[52:15.830 --> 52:21.430]  get... I was my... I went in with the goal of not yelling once. And you guys... and I failed
[52:21.950 --> 52:29.810]  yet again. I failed at everything in my life. I failed. So why should today have been any
[52:29.810 --> 52:35.870]  different? Thank you for listening to another episode of F*** Face, the podcast where we
[52:35.870 --> 52:41.670]  highlight the misery and failures of one Geoffrey Ramsey, while the much better and much more
[52:41.670 --> 52:50.850]  talented and much more likable Gavin Free and Andrew Panton dance through and on the misery
[52:50.850 --> 52:56.450]  that is me. Hope you liked it. If you liked it, maybe read or write a review or star it up or
[52:56.450 --> 53:01.530]  if you didn't like it, that makes sense because I'm in it. Thanks a lot. See you next week.
