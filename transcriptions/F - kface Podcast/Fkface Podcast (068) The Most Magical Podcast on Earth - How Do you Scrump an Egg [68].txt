[00:32.110 --> 00:36.010]  Hello and welcome to the most magical place on Earth.
[00:36.350 --> 00:39.950]  The magical podcast, F*** Face, where
[00:41.070 --> 00:45.750]  exceptional people do mind bending things and break the laws of physics.
[00:45.890 --> 00:46.910]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:46.950 --> 00:50.270]  And with me, always, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[00:50.890 --> 00:52.270]  I don't know. I don't know.
[00:52.310 --> 00:53.410]  I don't know what to say about that.
[00:53.650 --> 00:56.630]  We just finished recording another episode where I missed out
[00:56.630 --> 00:59.050]  on about two minutes of just bewilderment.
[00:59.130 --> 01:00.510]  And then we pressed record again.
[01:00.890 --> 01:04.030]  If you haven't listened to the last episode, go listen to it
[01:04.030 --> 01:06.830]  and then come back and listen to this one that we stopped down.
[01:07.470 --> 01:08.590]  Eric said, what the f***?
[01:08.590 --> 01:10.270]  Nick said, I'm scared.
[01:11.210 --> 01:13.570]  And I honestly don't know what to think about it.
[01:13.850 --> 01:16.450]  I feel like Andrew is pranking all of us now.
[01:16.650 --> 01:18.210]  No, I absolutely not.
[01:18.270 --> 01:20.410]  I thought you were pranking me when you're like, what did you say?
[01:20.690 --> 01:23.590]  And I told you I wrote the number before you said it
[01:23.590 --> 01:26.110]  because I couldn't see the screen. I didn't know what you did.
[01:26.150 --> 01:27.350]  I thought you didn't say it publicly.
[01:27.470 --> 01:29.510]  I thought you're just going to pretend that it was the right number.
[01:29.530 --> 01:30.630]  And I'm like, he's f***ing with me.
[01:30.670 --> 01:32.050]  There's no way that it just happened.
[01:32.450 --> 01:32.950]  And it did.
[01:33.130 --> 01:35.410]  And even if you did see the screen, there's no way
[01:35.410 --> 01:38.430]  you could have got the 19 ball out and taken a picture of it that quickly.
[01:38.910 --> 01:40.590]  Absolutely not. No.
[01:40.770 --> 01:45.350]  He would have had to have already had 60 photos like in a file tree,
[01:45.530 --> 01:47.430]  and then he would have to like rapidly click on it.
[01:47.530 --> 01:49.010]  There's no way he's going to put that much work into that.
[01:49.170 --> 01:50.090]  That bit. No way.
[01:51.350 --> 01:52.390]  No, absolutely not.
[01:52.530 --> 01:54.290]  That was f***ing crazy.
[01:54.430 --> 01:58.050]  I feel like we've been wrong about this whole Gavin being lucky thing.
[01:58.550 --> 01:59.970]  I feel like it might be you, Geoff.
[01:59.990 --> 02:02.070]  You might be the golden shot. Yeah, I guessed wrong.
[02:02.630 --> 02:04.770]  Well, maybe. I think this is both.
[02:05.290 --> 02:06.210]  I'll tell you what.
[02:06.210 --> 02:10.490]  I feel I feel I feel like if Najee Harris knew what was going on here,
[02:10.570 --> 02:12.150]  he'd feel very good about himself right now.
[02:12.370 --> 02:13.370]  Things are looking up for him.
[02:13.850 --> 02:15.470]  Let's put this to the ultimate test.
[02:15.710 --> 02:16.590]  Once again, the true.
[02:16.770 --> 02:20.170]  If you're better than Gavin, red or black, red or black?
[02:20.730 --> 02:23.010]  Black. I mean, I don't know why you're betting on colors,
[02:23.030 --> 02:24.510]  but you should clearly be betting on 19.
[02:25.150 --> 02:26.710]  That's a fascinating point.
[02:26.830 --> 02:27.650]  That's a great point.
[02:27.870 --> 02:29.270]  I'm going to do colors and 19.
[02:29.810 --> 02:31.330]  19 is our lucky number now.
[02:31.610 --> 02:34.430]  OK, tell me a face officially has a lucky number.
[02:34.430 --> 02:35.990]  What am I doing? Red or black?
[02:36.050 --> 02:39.490]  Red. OK, I'm putting three on red, two on 19.
[02:42.770 --> 02:43.770]  19 is red.
[02:43.870 --> 02:45.510]  If 19 was black, this would be a problem.
[02:49.970 --> 02:51.470]  Can't parlay a roulette spin.
[02:51.850 --> 02:52.790]  Eric, that's ridiculous.
[02:53.190 --> 02:55.330]  How dare you get the balls rolling around?
[02:56.190 --> 02:59.490]  Coming in, it's bouncing, still spinning.
[03:00.450 --> 03:02.870]  I've I've been going with the wrong person the whole time.
[03:02.870 --> 03:05.310]  I will be very... It's black and it's two.
[03:05.410 --> 03:06.850]  Magic doesn't exist. It's not real.
[03:07.390 --> 03:08.150]  It's not real.
[03:09.730 --> 03:10.770]  It's black and it's two.
[03:11.090 --> 03:12.710]  I think magic does exist.
[03:12.810 --> 03:14.570]  You just can't use it like that.
[03:15.010 --> 03:17.950]  It decides when it when it wants to be used.
[03:18.390 --> 03:22.930]  Our magic just rejects you every time you try to use it.
[03:26.130 --> 03:29.950]  What we really need to do is when Geoff's in Vegas, he needs to play 19 on roulette.
[03:29.970 --> 03:31.310]  He does. I'll do it. I'll do it.
[03:31.870 --> 03:33.130]  And I'll report back.
[03:33.270 --> 03:35.910]  Dude, this Henry farted so bad.
[03:38.050 --> 03:39.550]  You got gassed by the duck.
[03:39.650 --> 03:41.230]  I'll make it. I'll get gas out of the room.
[03:41.350 --> 03:43.590]  Jesus. That's brutal.
[03:43.950 --> 03:45.230]  I'm looking in Jersey numbers.
[03:45.850 --> 03:48.170]  I don't I don't think any of them are 19, unfortunately.
[03:48.770 --> 03:49.910]  Do you gamble every day?
[03:50.950 --> 03:52.030]  No, not at all.
[03:52.490 --> 03:54.130]  No, I don't know, dude.
[03:54.150 --> 03:56.870]  I I've been talking to Andrew quite a bit since you've been out of town
[03:56.870 --> 04:00.390]  and I've been having a lot of conversations with what I would call dark Andrew.
[04:00.790 --> 04:05.350]  That is that is like midnight our time, Andrew,
[04:05.450 --> 04:09.950]  who has had a bad run and is in it is not a good place.
[04:10.110 --> 04:12.550]  And I feel like we've had a lot of those conversations in the last
[04:12.550 --> 04:13.270]  since you've been gone.
[04:13.470 --> 04:17.090]  So, well, it's it's because you expressed interest
[04:17.090 --> 04:19.910]  and wanting to do some NFL bets.
[04:20.230 --> 04:21.830]  So I've been trying to update you on what's been going.
[04:21.910 --> 04:24.270]  I've been trying to let you vicariously live through my misery.
[04:24.810 --> 04:26.430]  Yeah, well, and I definitely have been.
[04:26.510 --> 04:28.610]  I just feel like that misery has been pretty daily.
[04:28.610 --> 04:29.930]  No, it's weekends.
[04:30.530 --> 04:32.450]  I'll throw a bet on on like Saturday.
[04:32.810 --> 04:34.170]  I don't bet all that often.
[04:34.650 --> 04:37.610]  And if I'm going to bet, it's mainly during the NFL season getting into.
[04:38.170 --> 04:41.230]  OK, what about the Astros Rangers?
[04:41.450 --> 04:42.950]  Bet you lost your shit on.
[04:43.650 --> 04:45.410]  That's why I parlayed that with NFL preseason.
[04:45.570 --> 04:47.570]  And that was a Saturday, I think, or a Sunday.
[04:47.630 --> 04:48.110]  It's a weekend.
[04:48.410 --> 04:49.190]  Those don't count.
[04:49.810 --> 04:53.150]  I bet the Astros, Gavin, the Astros were this huge favorite
[04:53.150 --> 04:57.310]  against the shitty other baseball team, and they lost in the first inning.
[04:57.310 --> 04:58.990]  They dropped down 3-0.
[04:59.310 --> 05:00.790]  The Astros were down 3-0.
[05:01.290 --> 05:03.950]  Fifth inning, they come back to make it 5-2.
[05:04.110 --> 05:04.870]  I'm like, there's a hope.
[05:05.170 --> 05:06.170]  There's some hope in this game.
[05:06.670 --> 05:09.570]  Next time I look at the score, the Astros are losing 2-12.
[05:10.050 --> 05:12.850]  They got demolished by one of the worst teams in baseball.
[05:13.770 --> 05:14.570]  Terrible luck.
[05:15.670 --> 05:19.150]  I actually I actually have a little sports thing that I read about.
[05:19.330 --> 05:19.670]  I don't know.
[05:19.930 --> 05:22.510]  Stop me if you guys have heard this story, but have you guys heard
[05:22.510 --> 05:26.650]  the thing that happened with Bishop Sycamore High School on ESPN?
[05:26.650 --> 05:27.870]  Like last weekend.
[05:28.090 --> 05:31.150]  No, it's they were like a fake school, right?
[05:31.310 --> 05:31.730]  Or something.
[05:31.930 --> 05:33.050]  So maybe. Yeah.
[05:33.150 --> 05:37.190]  So there was this from time to time ESPN will show high school football games,
[05:37.230 --> 05:40.950]  especially when they're 1A and there's a there's a ton of like top tier talent
[05:40.950 --> 05:42.950]  that's going to go into college.
[05:43.330 --> 05:46.030]  And I actually I actually skipped through the game.
[05:46.110 --> 05:48.070]  I was looking for Emily and I were looking for preseason football
[05:48.070 --> 05:49.170]  and we stopped on it.
[05:49.230 --> 05:50.290]  I was like, ah, this is fucking high school.
[05:50.350 --> 05:50.830]  We kept going.
[05:51.210 --> 05:54.610]  But up so on, I think it was last Sunday, but it may have been two Sundays ago.
[05:54.610 --> 05:57.450]  There was a high school game with one of the best high school
[05:58.070 --> 05:59.750]  football teams in the country.
[05:59.930 --> 06:03.250]  And they played this other team called Bishop Sycamore High School
[06:03.250 --> 06:06.430]  and beat the dog shit out of them.
[06:06.490 --> 06:09.710]  The game was 58 to nothing to the point where pretty early on
[06:09.710 --> 06:13.410]  the announcers were saying stuff like, should they call the game?
[06:13.890 --> 06:16.270]  Like people, they were worried about the other team's safety.
[06:16.330 --> 06:20.530]  They were getting they were so outmatched and getting so manhandled and so beaten.
[06:20.770 --> 06:23.910]  They were like, I don't know if this is safe for these two teams to be playing.
[06:23.910 --> 06:28.750]  And it became very it was billed as like two tier one football teams
[06:28.750 --> 06:31.730]  with some of the best talent in the nation playing against each other
[06:31.730 --> 06:33.990]  became apparent very quickly.
[06:34.110 --> 06:34.810]  That was not the case.
[06:35.130 --> 06:39.550]  Then they started to dive into it and discover like ESPN was like,
[06:39.650 --> 06:41.450]  we're sorry, we shouldn't have put this game on the air.
[06:41.530 --> 06:45.650]  It comes to find out you come to find out that the game was actually scheduled
[06:45.650 --> 06:47.270]  by a marketing company.
[06:47.870 --> 06:50.730]  Well, I guess that's something that happens like marketing companies
[06:50.730 --> 06:52.530]  schedule high school games for ESPN.
[06:52.530 --> 06:53.790]  They've been doing it for a long time.
[06:54.290 --> 06:56.550]  Then it came out that it might not be a real school
[06:56.550 --> 06:58.390]  that doesn't have like it has a P.O.
[06:58.410 --> 06:59.510]  box for an address.
[07:00.270 --> 07:03.310]  And then there was some then it came out that the the coach
[07:03.310 --> 07:07.050]  of the football team might have an active arrest warrant for fraud.
[07:07.550 --> 07:11.990]  Then it came out that this team that played on Sunday also played a game on Friday.
[07:12.170 --> 07:14.410]  So they played two high school games in two days.
[07:14.730 --> 07:19.230]  Then people started to dive in and realize this team has never won a game before
[07:19.230 --> 07:23.130]  and has no business being playing against this other team.
[07:23.390 --> 07:26.230]  Then people discovered that a lot of the players on the team
[07:26.230 --> 07:28.610]  weren't actually high school students and were adults.
[07:28.830 --> 07:30.770]  It just kept getting weirder and weirder.
[07:31.170 --> 07:32.270]  That's so strange.
[07:32.590 --> 07:34.450]  You've made me want to dig deeper into this.
[07:34.850 --> 07:37.810]  It's similar to that that mentally handicapped
[07:38.470 --> 07:41.650]  was it basketball team who all turned out to be just like
[07:42.230 --> 07:43.990]  they weren't they shouldn't have been in the Paralympics.
[07:44.350 --> 07:45.610]  I don't know. I've heard that.
[07:45.890 --> 07:48.690]  I've heard of I know a movie called The Ringer exists,
[07:48.690 --> 07:50.890]  and I do know that that was based on a true story.
[07:51.150 --> 07:51.990]  That was Johnny Knoxville.
[07:52.310 --> 07:53.570]  Yeah, in the early 2000s.
[07:53.630 --> 07:55.230]  I think that's sort of the plot of that movie.
[07:55.290 --> 07:56.770]  I don't really remember what that movie was about.
[07:56.970 --> 07:59.110]  I just don't understand what the goal would be.
[07:59.190 --> 08:01.810]  Was it to like, what's the play there?
[08:01.930 --> 08:03.390]  What where's where's the fraud?
[08:03.810 --> 08:07.050]  You know, is it to legitimize this Bishop Sycamore school
[08:07.050 --> 08:10.110]  or was it to make the other team look that much better?
[08:10.390 --> 08:11.750]  Like, what's the play there?
[08:12.230 --> 08:12.770]  You know what I mean?
[08:12.830 --> 08:14.450]  Like, I can't figure out what the grift is.
[08:14.710 --> 08:15.870]  That is bizarre.
[08:16.670 --> 08:17.470]  That's crazy.
[08:17.470 --> 08:18.950]  So many levels deep.
[08:19.430 --> 08:21.170]  Yeah. And I haven't I haven't read up on it lately,
[08:21.230 --> 08:22.970]  so there may be more information to it.
[08:23.210 --> 08:24.430]  It's just like it's just crazy.
[08:24.610 --> 08:27.030]  Like it's just like every story was like wackier than the next.
[08:27.090 --> 08:29.850]  And they were just like, keep peeling back these layers that made no sense.
[08:30.230 --> 08:32.910]  This sort of reminds me of a conversation we had, Gavin,
[08:33.250 --> 08:37.130]  about how football in Europe works with the teams in different leagues.
[08:37.510 --> 08:40.370]  I feel like you got totally lost in that conversation.
[08:40.910 --> 08:41.370]  What do you mean?
[08:41.830 --> 08:42.930]  You just seem very confused.
[08:43.470 --> 08:43.930]  And what way?
[08:44.530 --> 08:45.430]  I know I wasn't lost.
[08:45.730 --> 08:46.870]  I understand everything you're saying.
[08:46.870 --> 08:49.790]  I was just saying it's a lot of details like you gave a lot of surface
[08:49.790 --> 08:51.170]  information that would be interesting.
[08:51.650 --> 08:52.710]  Interesting to explore deeper.
[08:52.870 --> 08:55.170]  But you were like, why can't they jump up from the bottom division
[08:55.170 --> 08:56.190]  into the Premier League?
[08:56.630 --> 08:59.070]  Oh, I see. You just fucking threw.
[08:59.310 --> 09:00.110]  Now I'm confused.
[09:00.330 --> 09:03.290]  I thought you were talking about I seem confused during Geoff's conversation
[09:03.290 --> 09:06.270]  about the high school team, not our football conversation.
[09:06.930 --> 09:08.550]  That's why I was like, what are you talking about?
[09:08.610 --> 09:10.470]  I followed that. I followed that closely.
[09:10.830 --> 09:14.430]  Wait, so you change the subject to a new subject and then I respond to it
[09:14.430 --> 09:16.030]  and you think I'm still in the old subject?
[09:16.030 --> 09:18.930]  Yeah. Well, you just said you seem confused in that conversation.
[09:19.110 --> 09:21.890]  I didn't feel like we'd gone far enough into the conversation
[09:21.890 --> 09:22.950]  to call this conversation.
[09:23.070 --> 09:23.450]  I misunderstood.
[09:23.670 --> 09:26.190]  You're referencing the text conversation that we had.
[09:27.210 --> 09:29.830]  Gavin is explaining to me and correct me if I'm wrong.
[09:30.030 --> 09:33.130]  You may already notice, Geoff, but I guess in the Premier League,
[09:33.290 --> 09:37.030]  the bottom two teams get dropped to a lower league
[09:37.030 --> 09:40.010]  and the top two of the league below go up to that league.
[09:40.190 --> 09:41.250]  Yeah, it's called relegation.
[09:41.630 --> 09:42.110]  Shifting. Right.
[09:42.170 --> 09:43.470]  That's what it's called, right, Gavin? Relegation.
[09:43.870 --> 09:45.190]  Yeah. You get promoted or relegated.
[09:45.190 --> 09:47.630]  Yeah. And it's the top of the top of bottom three teams.
[09:47.910 --> 09:49.370]  I think that shouldn't end.
[09:49.530 --> 09:51.410]  I think that should be at all levels of play.
[09:51.710 --> 09:55.330]  I want a team to start at the Premier League and then be so bad
[09:55.330 --> 09:58.410]  that they're in like a youth league at that by the end of it.
[09:58.490 --> 10:01.090]  Like, I don't I think you should be able to just keep going down
[10:01.090 --> 10:02.070]  if you keep losing.
[10:02.510 --> 10:03.870]  Can you go keep going up?
[10:04.030 --> 10:05.630]  Yeah, but that is what happens.
[10:05.630 --> 10:08.970]  If you lose, if you lose, if you're bottom three again the next season,
[10:08.990 --> 10:10.090]  you would go down again.
[10:10.750 --> 10:12.150]  But there's a limit to it.
[10:12.170 --> 10:14.530]  You said there is a cap of like you can only fall so far.
[10:14.530 --> 10:17.890]  I want it to be like I spent five billion dollars on this team.
[10:18.010 --> 10:20.850]  I'm now playing in a field behind an elementary school.
[10:21.250 --> 10:23.450]  Like, I want there to be a huge collapse.
[10:24.250 --> 10:28.790]  Do you want to see Manchester City go from the Premier League to a club team?
[10:28.810 --> 10:30.150]  Absolutely. Yes.
[10:30.310 --> 10:31.390]  Like whatever's lower.
[10:31.990 --> 10:35.550]  I want like Manchester United to be in a league where one of the parents
[10:35.550 --> 10:37.370]  has to bring orange slices every game.
[10:37.630 --> 10:39.310]  Like that's the fall of.
[10:40.030 --> 10:44.430]  I mean, you do get Premier League teams who may drop like two or three
[10:44.530 --> 10:47.650]  divisions, but it would take two or three years to do it.
[10:47.750 --> 10:50.810]  You would have to you would have to lose multiple back to back seasons.
[10:50.970 --> 10:54.230]  You can't just jump three down in one year.
[10:54.770 --> 10:56.630]  No, I know that I'm saying year by year.
[10:56.770 --> 11:00.870]  I just I like the idea of a billion dollar franchise being in an orange
[11:00.870 --> 11:04.330]  slice league division and somebody who runs a youth team
[11:04.330 --> 11:05.870]  all of a sudden being in a fucking stadium.
[11:06.350 --> 11:07.010]  That's I love.
[11:07.210 --> 11:10.690]  I love some local village having to go to Old Trafford to play
[11:11.230 --> 11:13.770]  Man U because they've been relocated so many times.
[11:13.770 --> 11:15.450]  What a what?
[11:16.210 --> 11:17.710]  Like, can we look that up?
[11:17.730 --> 11:19.950]  Like what's the farthest the team has fallen from?
[11:20.130 --> 11:21.410]  Yeah. How would you Google that?
[11:21.510 --> 11:26.090]  I don't know. I mean, this all came about because I was watching Ted Lasso
[11:26.090 --> 11:29.690]  and they mentioned that in in the show where I guess the NFL,
[11:30.050 --> 11:34.410]  if you finish bottom of the league, you just come back again next year.
[11:34.650 --> 11:35.630]  Yeah. And play again.
[11:35.890 --> 11:37.290]  And you're still in the NFL.
[11:37.730 --> 11:40.170]  Well, there isn't really a minor leagues for the NFL.
[11:40.410 --> 11:41.630]  Like it's just what if you suck?
[11:41.710 --> 11:43.630]  Do you just lose over and over and over again?
[11:43.630 --> 11:46.670]  And you don't go anywhere and there's no opportunity for a new team.
[11:46.790 --> 11:48.070]  How do you get a new team?
[11:48.630 --> 11:50.230]  Money. A lot of money.
[11:50.470 --> 11:51.950]  And you don't. You're just shifting.
[11:53.010 --> 11:56.030]  That's what you're describing is the Orlando magic.
[11:56.230 --> 11:58.130]  It sucks. You just don't get to be a good team.
[11:58.130 --> 12:01.350]  How does the whole sport not just get really stale?
[12:01.670 --> 12:03.570]  Yeah. Jacksonville Jaguars. Great call.
[12:04.030 --> 12:04.930]  You get a number one pick.
[12:05.130 --> 12:05.750]  You're dead last.
[12:05.930 --> 12:08.250]  You theoretically are getting good talent.
[12:08.670 --> 12:11.110]  The way it's supposed to work is the worse a team does,
[12:11.210 --> 12:13.050]  the better they get they do in the draft.
[12:13.050 --> 12:16.050]  So they get access to the best players that are coming into the league.
[12:16.190 --> 12:17.350]  So it's supposed to balance it out.
[12:17.930 --> 12:20.890]  Hmm. Like if you were the Cleveland Cavaliers,
[12:21.210 --> 12:24.990]  a perennially shitty team that underperforms in a small market,
[12:25.170 --> 12:28.390]  then you get the first pick and you get to pick LeBron James.
[12:29.050 --> 12:29.530]  And they did.
[12:29.730 --> 12:31.090]  Doesn't seem like a huge incentive.
[12:31.290 --> 12:34.610]  Like the risk of dropping from one league to the league below
[12:34.610 --> 12:39.990]  is financially huge, like ginormous amount of money different.
[12:40.630 --> 12:42.430]  So I don't understand the incentive.
[12:43.050 --> 12:47.350]  To play well in the NFL, if you could just sit at the bottom year after year.
[12:47.530 --> 12:51.690]  Well, if you don't play well for long enough, you might lose your team.
[12:51.770 --> 12:53.130]  They might just move to another city.
[12:53.290 --> 12:56.970]  But also there is no there's no league below that for you to play.
[12:57.090 --> 13:01.270]  Yeah, it would be like the top CFL team would go up to the NFL
[13:01.270 --> 13:03.410]  and then just lose every game like it wouldn't.
[13:03.630 --> 13:03.990]  There's no.
[13:04.670 --> 13:07.750]  That's insane, especially considering the size of this country.
[13:08.010 --> 13:10.510]  There's one league. Insane.
[13:10.650 --> 13:11.610]  Well, there's the XFL.
[13:11.950 --> 13:12.750]  It's going to come back.
[13:12.750 --> 13:13.990]  I think next year.
[13:14.270 --> 13:16.770]  Yeah, but you're saying it's not in relation to the NFL.
[13:16.970 --> 13:18.670]  It's not it's not you drop into that one.
[13:18.970 --> 13:20.070]  Oh, no, absolutely not.
[13:20.470 --> 13:22.030]  This could technically work.
[13:22.170 --> 13:25.430]  What you're describing could work in the NBA because there is a minor leagues.
[13:25.570 --> 13:28.430]  There's a D league and it could work in baseball because there's the you know,
[13:28.450 --> 13:29.570]  there's a ball.
[13:29.850 --> 13:33.210]  But yeah, it's just there's just no there's no infrastructure for that in football.
[13:33.210 --> 13:36.490]  They could theoretically do it with baseball and basketball, though.
[13:36.610 --> 13:40.690]  The problem isn't the fact that there it's not just a structure problem.
[13:40.690 --> 13:43.430]  It's a all the best talent plays in one league problem.
[13:43.890 --> 13:46.530]  Like you, even though there is an infrastructure in basketball,
[13:46.710 --> 13:49.970]  nobody's opting to play in the G League over the NBA. Yeah.
[13:50.610 --> 13:52.590]  I said D league and the G League. Sorry. You're right.
[13:52.930 --> 13:54.930]  Hockey, I mean, it's a completely other thing for the draft.
[13:55.030 --> 13:58.410]  The draft in hockey is sort of ridiculous, where even like
[13:58.410 --> 14:00.830]  unless you have a top top pick, you're like, yeah,
[14:00.830 --> 14:02.510]  that player will help us in three years.
[14:02.630 --> 14:03.910]  Can't wait. That's fun.
[14:04.490 --> 14:07.010]  Like there's no the NFL has massive turnover.
[14:07.010 --> 14:11.030]  And I don't know if football like soccer, football has the same
[14:11.030 --> 14:15.190]  where a team can be wildly awful one season and then have a great offseason
[14:15.190 --> 14:16.170]  and become a playoff team.
[14:16.310 --> 14:18.430]  I don't know what the competitive shift is.
[14:18.570 --> 14:22.150]  And I should point out that in in soccer football, there's no playoffs either.
[14:22.750 --> 14:23.810]  You just finish.
[14:24.350 --> 14:27.170]  You just play every other team twice and then that's it.
[14:27.770 --> 14:29.270]  That's no. Yeah, that's no fun.
[14:30.030 --> 14:33.490]  And if you have the same amount of points at the top of the league,
[14:33.570 --> 14:35.370]  you just see who scored more goals.
[14:35.370 --> 14:37.690]  I learned about a thing recently about.
[14:38.270 --> 14:41.110]  So goal differential is a big thing in football, right?
[14:41.150 --> 14:43.070]  For like determining seating or whatever.
[14:43.610 --> 14:46.430]  I don't know if that's across all football in this league specifically.
[14:46.590 --> 14:49.890]  There is a tournament and goal differential between teams
[14:49.890 --> 14:52.590]  was a big factor in like the playoff setting
[14:52.590 --> 14:54.850]  or I guess who would advance to the finals.
[14:55.350 --> 14:58.490]  And the two teams that are playing each other, one was in the finals.
[14:58.610 --> 14:59.930]  The other one was out of it.
[15:00.250 --> 15:04.310]  And they needed to win by two goals to advance for this tournament.
[15:04.310 --> 15:06.610]  They created a weird like let's make it spicy.
[15:06.830 --> 15:09.310]  They decided that a golden goal would be worth two,
[15:09.730 --> 15:11.210]  which correct me if I'm wrong, Gavin.
[15:11.310 --> 15:14.250]  A golden goal is if you score with the extra time remaining, right?
[15:14.270 --> 15:15.230]  Like it ends the game.
[15:15.350 --> 15:17.610]  That's the last goal, essentially. Is that what a golden goal is?
[15:17.850 --> 15:19.190]  Golden goal? Yeah, I think they stopped doing it.
[15:19.230 --> 15:21.110]  But yeah, it was an extra time.
[15:21.290 --> 15:23.050]  The first goal ended the game.
[15:23.510 --> 15:26.170]  Yeah. So they had this rule for this tournament where a golden goal
[15:26.170 --> 15:27.450]  now counted for two.
[15:27.650 --> 15:31.010]  The team that needed to win by two was winning by one.
[15:31.150 --> 15:33.510]  And there was like six or seven minutes left.
[15:33.510 --> 15:38.430]  And they thought, we probably aren't going to score within this time.
[15:38.610 --> 15:40.630]  We need more time and we need two goals.
[15:41.250 --> 15:44.830]  It's better if we just score on ourselves and force it to go into overtime.
[15:45.390 --> 15:48.430]  So they just played pass with the keeper back and forth for a bit.
[15:48.630 --> 15:50.250]  And then they scored in their own net.
[15:50.410 --> 15:52.650]  And the other team was like, what the fuck is going on?
[15:52.950 --> 15:57.510]  And then they realized, oh, there's this weird two goal golden goal rule.
[15:58.010 --> 16:01.710]  So there is a brief period of time before like overtime started
[16:01.710 --> 16:05.410]  where one team was trying to score in either net
[16:05.410 --> 16:07.010]  because they could lose by one.
[16:07.170 --> 16:08.270]  They just couldn't lose by two.
[16:08.490 --> 16:11.630]  And the other team had to protect both goals.
[16:12.310 --> 16:13.970]  And they were not...
[16:13.970 --> 16:18.550]  The team that needed to protect both or score in either didn't do it.
[16:18.630 --> 16:21.490]  They went to overtime and the team that scored on themselves
[16:21.490 --> 16:25.790]  then scored the golden goal one and pushed the other team out of the finals
[16:25.790 --> 16:28.470]  because they scored on themselves and got into that position.
[16:28.510 --> 16:29.890]  That is batshit.
[16:29.890 --> 16:31.170]  Yeah, it's great.
[16:31.690 --> 16:34.350]  I wish that there was more ridiculousness like that in football.
[16:34.430 --> 16:37.630]  That is sort of in the spirit of my rule of teams can fall endlessly.
[16:38.150 --> 16:40.850]  Yeah, that would make me way more interested in that sport.

[18:22.520 --> 18:24.900]  like work and life and stress.
[18:25.280 --> 18:29.520]  You can't always control the vibes out there, but you can always control
[18:29.520 --> 18:34.680]  the vibes in your head with a pair of Raycon wireless earbuds in your ears.
[18:34.920 --> 18:36.720]  I use them on my bike rides.
[18:36.820 --> 18:41.160]  I go for bike rides almost every day, pop in some wireless Raycon earbuds
[18:41.160 --> 18:45.800]  and I can listen to a podcast or listen to some music.
[18:46.020 --> 18:49.140]  I will say I tend to listen to them lower on one side
[18:49.140 --> 18:50.960]  because you don't pay attention when you're riding your bicycle.
[18:50.960 --> 18:53.840]  You don't want to get surprised by a car.
[18:54.520 --> 18:57.940]  Whether you use them to pump up, wind down, work or work out,
[18:58.280 --> 19:02.620]  Raycons are the go to for on the go audio and the new everyday earbuds
[19:02.620 --> 19:06.640]  look, feel and sound better than ever before with an improved
[19:06.640 --> 19:08.400]  rubber oil look and feel.
[19:08.600 --> 19:10.680]  It's it feels and looks sleek.
[19:10.920 --> 19:12.200]  I'll say that that's a good way to describe it.
[19:12.240 --> 19:15.220]  Sleek and an optimized gel tip for the perfect in-ear fit.
[19:15.420 --> 19:18.640]  These are impressive before you even start listening.
[19:18.640 --> 19:21.860]  There's also an all new awareness mode for when you need to listen
[19:21.860 --> 19:25.140]  to your surroundings instead, a la when you're on a bicycle.
[19:26.420 --> 19:30.320]  Raycons offer up to eight hours of playtime and a 32 hour battery life.
[19:30.600 --> 19:34.400]  I wish I had the kind of stamina to ride my bike that long, but I don't.
[19:34.480 --> 19:35.980]  So they more than cover it.
[19:36.180 --> 19:39.080]  There's also a built in mic you can use to take calls on your earbuds
[19:39.080 --> 19:40.140]  at the press of a button.
[19:40.320 --> 19:43.400]  And they start at half the price of other premium audio brands.

[20:03.220 --> 20:05.960]  Eric says, what was the thing we needed to cover in this episode?
[20:06.160 --> 20:08.080]  Yeah, we kind of went on a weird sports car.
[20:08.100 --> 20:09.280]  We have a few things we can talk about.
[20:09.340 --> 20:10.820]  You guys want to talk about your jet ski?
[20:10.960 --> 20:12.200]  Was that on anyone's list?
[20:12.260 --> 20:14.060]  What we just spent 20 minutes talking about?
[20:14.300 --> 20:15.700]  No, not at all.
[20:15.700 --> 20:19.260]  I don't even know how we got we got there because I drew 19
[20:19.260 --> 20:22.740]  from the ping pong, but so we talked about
[20:23.680 --> 20:26.320]  this episode on the end of last week's episode.
[20:26.460 --> 20:29.060]  Yeah. OK, that was a great flood, by the way, Andrew.
[20:29.120 --> 20:30.640]  I don't want that. I didn't.
[20:30.680 --> 20:33.500]  I was going to call it a ping pong machine, a bingo machine
[20:33.500 --> 20:34.380]  and a lot of machine.
[20:34.540 --> 20:37.060]  It just came ping, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[20:38.860 --> 20:42.700]  Well, Gavin, do you want to talk about the jet ski adventure?
[20:43.220 --> 20:44.460]  We went on jet skis.
[20:45.100 --> 20:49.060]  So I think I wasn't imagining jet skiing, right?
[20:49.200 --> 20:52.600]  Because when you were describing how you were going on jet skis
[20:52.600 --> 20:56.780]  and you said you went like 50 miles an hour, I just thought you were exaggerating.
[20:57.100 --> 20:59.340]  I just thought you were rounding, just plucking a random number
[20:59.340 --> 21:01.880]  and you would have been going like 18 miles an hour or something.
[21:02.460 --> 21:04.100]  But they really go 50 miles an hour.
[21:04.380 --> 21:08.500]  We got on them, we got out of the slow bit and then Emily
[21:10.340 --> 21:11.400]  absolutely floored it.
[21:11.680 --> 21:13.900]  And I think my mouth just fell open
[21:13.900 --> 21:17.460]  because I was still like, I was still trying to remember all the stuff the guy told me.
[21:17.600 --> 21:19.920]  I looked down to be like, OK, well, that's a speedometer.
[21:20.160 --> 21:20.940]  That's OK. Here's how I did.
[21:21.180 --> 21:22.720]  I looked up. You were on the horizon.
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.480]  You were like going around the curvature of the earth.
[21:25.740 --> 21:27.820]  You were hauling ass.
[21:28.480 --> 21:30.020]  They go so fast.
[21:31.940 --> 21:36.320]  And it really took me a while to like to brave it and get up to that speed.
[21:36.380 --> 21:39.660]  I think I was freaking out at 30 because at that speed,
[21:40.260 --> 21:44.640]  any tiny little bump in the, you know, in the waves will just send you into the air.
[21:44.840 --> 21:45.740]  So I was like, oh, God.
[21:45.880 --> 21:48.960]  And so you'd see a wave coming and I'd immediately let off because I was like,
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.400]  I'm just going to go sailing off this thing when I get there.
[21:51.620 --> 21:54.280]  And I would slow down to like what felt like maybe 15
[21:54.280 --> 21:56.980]  and it would just slam my ass against the sea.
[21:57.060 --> 22:00.200]  I'd be like, oh, and I'd be like, oh, damn, I'm glad I wasn't going 30.
[22:01.320 --> 22:04.980]  I feel like every wave you had visions of Kanye flying through the air.
[22:05.320 --> 22:06.140]  Dude. Yeah.
[22:06.140 --> 22:09.800]  Well, that is one thing as we were because we did about we did three hours,
[22:09.960 --> 22:11.740]  which I learned is maybe a little long.
[22:12.040 --> 22:13.400]  Usually we do, too.
[22:14.240 --> 22:18.360]  But I felt like every minute was closer
[22:18.360 --> 22:21.940]  to the inevitable accident that we're building towards.
[22:22.100 --> 22:25.120]  Like the second Gavin and I got on the on the same water
[22:25.120 --> 22:28.200]  in two different jet skis, I just realized that
[22:28.200 --> 22:32.540]  that an accident is like is an inevitability.
[22:32.540 --> 22:36.740]  That is metaphysical certitude that Gavin and I will get into a jet ski accident
[22:36.740 --> 22:37.900]  together, and it didn't.
[22:38.020 --> 22:39.000]  We dodged it that day.
[22:39.180 --> 22:43.200]  But I can feel the gravity of that accident pulling us forward.
[22:43.340 --> 22:46.780]  The bad thing is, was that the amount of time it took me to gain
[22:46.780 --> 22:49.760]  just a little bit of confidence was extremely short.
[22:49.940 --> 22:52.860]  I would say after 20 minutes, I was just trying to I was like
[22:52.860 --> 22:54.820]  finding the smooth bits of the water.
[22:54.960 --> 22:57.080]  You're trying to get out the way of the boat wakes and stuff
[22:57.080 --> 22:58.840]  to the point where I was like, all right, let's see.
[22:59.140 --> 23:00.220]  Let's see how fast this one goes.
[23:00.220 --> 23:03.980]  And I would just eke up a little bit each time, like 10 minutes later,
[23:03.980 --> 23:05.020]  I'd be like a 40.
[23:05.200 --> 23:07.340]  And then eventually I was just like, I'm just going to hold this down
[23:07.340 --> 23:08.760]  and see what I could get to.
[23:08.820 --> 23:11.760]  And I got it to the point where the speedometer literally stopped
[23:11.760 --> 23:13.860]  at 55 miles an hour.
[23:13.940 --> 23:16.320]  And then I let off and I was like, oh, I'm getting some confidence now.
[23:16.740 --> 23:21.500]  I'd say 30 minutes later, I had a sustained three minute period
[23:21.500 --> 23:24.000]  where I was just going 55 miles an hour.
[23:24.540 --> 23:27.620]  And at that point, I was like, this thing's not fast enough anymore.
[23:27.800 --> 23:29.200]  I want to go even faster than this.
[23:29.200 --> 23:31.960]  And there was a one point where I was I was holding it down.
[23:32.120 --> 23:34.600]  The jet ski sounded like it was going to explode.
[23:34.780 --> 23:36.240]  It had just a sustain.
[23:36.320 --> 23:37.520]  I was like, this is going to overheat.
[23:37.780 --> 23:40.780]  I was sustained 55 for about three straight minutes.
[23:40.900 --> 23:42.600]  And I looked down at the fuel gauge.
[23:42.720 --> 23:45.520]  And as I looked, it just went and it plopped down like one whole bar.
[23:46.360 --> 23:49.600]  I will say at the end, I asked you, I was like, how do you think?
[23:49.660 --> 23:50.520]  How do you feel about it, man?
[23:50.740 --> 23:54.960]  And you said, it's amazing how quickly you go from holy shit.
[23:55.120 --> 23:58.980]  50 miles an hour is so fast on a jet ski to why won't this thing
[23:58.980 --> 24:00.540]  go faster than 50 miles an hour?
[24:01.000 --> 24:02.880]  Yeah, I could. Which is totally true.
[24:03.420 --> 24:04.680]  The same with me on roller coasters.
[24:04.900 --> 24:08.300]  Like if I go to a theme park, the first roller coaster I set foot on,
[24:08.780 --> 24:10.780]  I'm thinking, why am I on a roller coaster?
[24:10.840 --> 24:12.520]  This is terrifying. I hate this.
[24:12.580 --> 24:13.420]  I've got my eyes closed.
[24:13.500 --> 24:16.840]  I'm like gripping as hard as I can, but maybe three or four rides later.
[24:16.840 --> 24:19.900]  I'm like, why isn't there one that goes 150 miles an hour?
[24:22.420 --> 24:26.200]  So then you have to you have to just try other stuff like they were like,
[24:26.220 --> 24:28.520]  well, you know, if you tip over a jet ski, here's how you write it.
[24:28.520 --> 24:29.660]  You don't have a lot of time.
[24:29.860 --> 24:33.260]  I think was it like 60 seconds or something to tip it over before it's 60 seconds?
[24:33.320 --> 24:37.100]  Yeah. So I was just thinking, how violently can I turn on this thing?
[24:37.180 --> 24:39.700]  I was just like, what does it take to tip one of these?
[24:39.900 --> 24:42.020]  And then I started chasing someone's boat.
[24:42.140 --> 24:46.060]  I was probably like 100 feet behind it and just doing little jumps off the wakes,
[24:46.460 --> 24:49.300]  just doing some some stuff that you shouldn't have been doing
[24:49.300 --> 24:50.780]  the first time you've ever ridden a jet ski.
[24:51.560 --> 24:52.840]  But oh my God, it was fun.
[24:52.880 --> 24:56.140]  And then and then Geoff and I were taking it in turns to do little jumps over this wake.
[24:57.740 --> 25:03.260]  The that is like the best part about being on the jet ski is is driving behind a bigger boat
[25:03.260 --> 25:04.860]  and just jumping off their wake.
[25:04.980 --> 25:09.160]  You feel like like a horsefly on on the back of a cow or a horse, you know,
[25:09.180 --> 25:10.160]  and it's like trying to swat you away.
[25:10.240 --> 25:12.480]  And you're just like you're just like jumping around it, bugging it.
[25:12.540 --> 25:13.920]  But it is so much fucking fun.
[25:14.080 --> 25:17.940]  I'm really glad you enjoyed it because it is like the most fun.
[25:18.680 --> 25:22.140]  It's weird. You really get a feel like a visual feel about what the water is like.
[25:22.200 --> 25:24.200]  Like there's areas where it is just flat.
[25:24.200 --> 25:26.200]  There's nothing happening and you can really go.
[25:26.700 --> 25:29.620]  Then there's areas of chop where it's like a small amount.
[25:29.820 --> 25:34.500]  But you know that if you go too fast, you will just slam your asshole on the seat.
[25:34.640 --> 25:35.980]  It will like pound your spine.
[25:36.420 --> 25:40.240]  Yeah. And there's like this in between phase where there's a lot of small waves
[25:40.240 --> 25:44.380]  and you can absolutely floor over those because you just kind of glide along the top of them.
[25:44.740 --> 25:48.320]  So you'll hear it go like as you're just sailing over the very tops.
[25:48.440 --> 25:49.320]  So it's like a meat.
[25:49.400 --> 25:52.820]  It's like you learn all this stuff just from from looking at the water in front of you.
[25:52.820 --> 25:55.060]  And then you end up being a pretty good judge of what you can do.
[25:55.180 --> 26:00.080]  Do you remember the the prize we found floating in the water that we almost hit?
[26:02.140 --> 26:04.040]  What? Oh, my God.
[26:04.920 --> 26:09.440]  There was a point where we were jumping wakes and we were like getting airborne.
[26:09.700 --> 26:14.640]  And I jumped a bit like we jumped a big thing and came down in the water and kind of like
[26:14.640 --> 26:19.020]  and looked up and I looked to my left and I screamed out loud
[26:19.020 --> 26:22.500]  because there was a giant hoof looking at me floating out of the water.
[26:22.820 --> 26:23.940]  A foot away.
[26:24.080 --> 26:27.740]  And we look over and there's just a giant dead fucking deer
[26:28.380 --> 26:32.340]  floating in the middle of Lake Austin.
[26:32.580 --> 26:35.980]  Like, I just I don't know how much a deer is like hundreds and a hundred
[26:35.980 --> 26:37.880]  eight hundred pound deer, maybe, I don't know, six hundred pound deer.
[26:38.220 --> 26:39.380]  The entire fucking thing.
[26:39.460 --> 26:42.000]  Just like his dead eyes staring out of the sky.
[26:42.220 --> 26:43.280]  Oh, my God. Fucking hooves.
[26:43.480 --> 26:45.400]  It was it was gruesome.
[26:45.420 --> 26:46.900]  How close were you to landing on it?
[26:47.160 --> 26:48.740]  Probably within like three or four feet.
[26:48.880 --> 26:49.340]  Jesus. Yeah.
[26:49.380 --> 26:51.720]  Do you go like alongside it or over it?
[26:51.720 --> 26:53.640]  I feel like you went to the right. Really?
[26:53.800 --> 26:57.040]  Yeah, I landed like next to it when I moved over to the right.
[26:57.460 --> 27:00.060]  But behind us was about 400 boats pulling
[27:01.680 --> 27:04.740]  like skiers and skim boarders and wakeboarders and shit.
[27:04.840 --> 27:08.140]  So I got to imagine that a couple of people probably hit it
[27:08.140 --> 27:10.140]  or had closer run ins with it than we did.
[27:10.140 --> 27:12.300]  So I have two immediate questions.
[27:12.720 --> 27:18.160]  One is Geoff sent me a video of the jet skiing experience with you, Gavin.
[27:18.200 --> 27:19.500]  Is that up anywhere?
[27:19.640 --> 27:21.000]  Has have people seen that yet?
[27:21.000 --> 27:22.560]  We should put that on Instagram.
[27:22.760 --> 27:25.280]  Yeah, I think we'll put it up with this episode.
[27:25.440 --> 27:27.540]  I it's a good call. I haven't uploaded it.
[27:27.620 --> 27:28.800]  We should put that on Instagram.
[27:28.940 --> 27:31.080]  Maybe even I know it's only like a YouTube thing.
[27:31.120 --> 27:31.520]  I don't know.
[27:31.700 --> 27:33.700]  But we should have that in a place where people could see.
[27:33.880 --> 27:35.620]  I love that video. It's fantastic.
[27:35.900 --> 27:36.380]  I'm a big fan.
[27:36.400 --> 27:39.300]  That was just that's the only thing I knew about this experience going into it.
[27:39.920 --> 27:43.340]  The second question I have, you guys mentioned accidents
[27:43.340 --> 27:45.200]  and we're talking about sports in my mind.
[27:45.280 --> 27:46.160]  I don't know if this exists.
[27:46.260 --> 27:47.180]  I assume it doesn't.
[27:47.620 --> 27:52.700]  Could we do some form of like jet ski jousting with like two sticks
[27:52.700 --> 27:56.340]  and like a giant pillow or like a foam thing and just mash into it?
[27:57.060 --> 27:58.520]  I don't I'm not saying 50.
[27:58.580 --> 28:00.540]  I'm not saying we're going your crazy speed.
[28:00.700 --> 28:01.840]  I feel like there's a medium.
[28:02.240 --> 28:04.380]  I feel like this could be the evolution of jousting.
[28:04.480 --> 28:07.740]  I would pay so much money to watch two jet skis go parallel.
[28:08.060 --> 28:12.020]  Well, I feel like the thing is, even if you collide accidentally head on at 10,
[28:12.400 --> 28:15.720]  you're going to bang heads with the other person at 20 miles an hour combined.
[28:16.220 --> 28:16.980]  No, you're not.
[28:17.420 --> 28:18.020]  You got to be.
[28:18.220 --> 28:18.940]  There's a separation.
[28:19.100 --> 28:20.080]  There has to be a barrier.
[28:20.420 --> 28:21.800]  I'm regulating the sport.
[28:21.960 --> 28:22.720]  You're not just going.
[28:23.040 --> 28:24.320]  You got to hit with sticks though.
[28:24.980 --> 28:25.820]  Yeah, well, that's fine.
[28:25.900 --> 28:26.880]  You won't die from that.
[28:26.960 --> 28:27.980]  I'm just saying we get a barrier.
[28:28.060 --> 28:29.020]  There's a way to do this.
[28:29.100 --> 28:29.840]  I don't like that.
[28:29.840 --> 28:33.680]  You're immediately cutting down my idea on a regulation aspect of it.
[28:33.700 --> 28:35.320]  Like you're ignoring any of the fun.
[28:35.480 --> 28:37.180]  You're just like there are safety concerns.
[28:37.340 --> 28:38.960]  What if the jet skis ram into each other?
[28:39.220 --> 28:40.300]  What do you think about this, Geoff?
[28:42.380 --> 28:45.080]  Uh, I think Andrew should spearhead it.
[28:45.720 --> 28:51.120]  I think, Andrew, I think you should come jet skiing with us first and then see if you still think that's a good idea.
[28:51.300 --> 28:51.540]  Yeah.
[28:52.020 --> 28:53.560]  I'm saying it would be fun to watch.
[28:53.640 --> 28:54.600]  I didn't say it was a good idea.
[28:55.700 --> 28:56.440]  Well, I agree.
[28:56.520 --> 28:58.960]  It would be it would be fun for me to watch you guys do this.
[28:59.460 --> 29:00.520]  I don't want to run this league.
[29:01.680 --> 29:03.020]  I don't want to kill anybody.
[29:03.940 --> 29:04.340]  Yeah.
[29:05.080 --> 29:06.800]  It's different if you witness it happening.
[29:07.100 --> 29:14.380]  I do think I'm not sure where to go with this, but I feel like there is more content to be had in the world of jet skiing.
[29:14.380 --> 29:16.740]  I think it's a highest jump quest.
[29:16.980 --> 29:21.980]  I think that's a great idea, Gavin, because I think we both easily jumped.
[29:22.400 --> 29:24.780]  How high do you think we went on our max jumps?
[29:25.160 --> 29:28.000]  I mean, in my head, in my head, like 20 feet.
[29:28.180 --> 29:31.000]  In reality, maybe four or five feet.
[29:31.100 --> 29:31.980]  I definitely got some air.
[29:32.060 --> 29:37.040]  I got enough air to fucking slam my knee so hard I thought I broke it.
[29:37.740 --> 29:40.520]  Is that the evolution of the Geoff Trick video?
[29:40.920 --> 29:43.360]  Is the next one going to be a jet ski slow motion?
[29:43.360 --> 29:44.380]  I think it has to be.
[29:44.580 --> 29:48.180]  I just put up the Gavin Slomo jet ski video in the Slack.
[29:48.580 --> 29:50.080]  It's fantastic. Or in the Discord, rather.
[29:50.720 --> 29:53.820]  Yeah, I think I think that's the evolution is a jet ski stunt.
[29:54.320 --> 29:57.480]  I wonder, OK, so what if we get one of those floating ramps that you get in GTA?
[29:58.300 --> 29:59.760]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:59.880 --> 30:03.940]  Like you're calling my idea dumb and then your reference point is a thing in GTA.
[30:04.800 --> 30:05.560]  How do we get it?
[30:05.560 --> 30:07.580]  How do we get one of those sprunk ramps?
[30:10.640 --> 30:13.100]  We got to get someone to make us a sprunk ramp.
[30:18.500 --> 30:19.120]  That's great.
[30:19.180 --> 30:21.680]  This is a great is a great place to take the bike trick.
[30:21.780 --> 30:23.860]  The next one, it's definitely, you know, we could do too, Gav,
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.080]  is we could do synchronized tricks.
[30:27.600 --> 30:28.320]  Oh, yeah.
[30:28.860 --> 30:32.060]  See, I feel like that's as dangerous in my mind as my jousting idea.
[30:32.300 --> 30:35.660]  You two trying to do tricks at the same time within a frame shot of each other?
[30:35.960 --> 30:36.940]  Yeah, maybe that's what we need to do.
[30:36.940 --> 30:38.640]  How about this, Andrew? We'll rent a boat.
[30:38.820 --> 30:39.600]  You'll be on the boat.
[30:40.040 --> 30:41.440]  You operate the Phantom, right?
[30:41.580 --> 30:44.860]  And Geoff and I will cross paths along the wake.
[30:45.240 --> 30:47.680]  We'll get air and pass each other in the air.
[30:47.920 --> 30:48.760]  Oh, my God.
[30:49.280 --> 30:50.000]  Through the frame.
[30:50.140 --> 30:51.700]  A jet ski mid-air high five.
[30:53.060 --> 30:54.180]  God, we're going to die.
[30:54.560 --> 30:57.420]  We're going to you're going to have to step in and say no.
[30:57.680 --> 31:03.040]  Like for the sake of my continued job and like you guys not dying or like breaking.
[31:03.200 --> 31:06.180]  I have to say no to the midair that there's no way.
[31:06.180 --> 31:08.040]  There's no way you're going to die.
[31:08.120 --> 31:09.300]  You're going to rip off each other's arms.
[31:09.480 --> 31:11.060]  You know what else Eric said no way about?
[31:14.580 --> 31:16.080]  I think we would end up.
[31:16.160 --> 31:19.080]  We would end up sat on each other's jet skis facing the wrong way.
[31:21.520 --> 31:24.900]  It would be like that episode of Baywatch
[31:24.900 --> 31:27.640]  where Hulk Hogan gets hit by a jet ski and almost dies.
[31:27.780 --> 31:29.900]  It needs to be one of you would go down.
[31:33.140 --> 31:33.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:33.860 --> 31:36.440]  Well, can't open a card box with one arm.
[31:36.720 --> 31:37.800]  Yeah, but Hulk Hogan made it.
[31:38.140 --> 31:40.580]  Well, if Hulk Hogan can make it, we got that going for us.
[31:40.620 --> 31:40.980]  That's true.
[31:41.220 --> 31:42.820]  Wow. So that was Eric noping that one.
[31:42.900 --> 31:43.560]  All right. All right.
[31:43.720 --> 31:45.260]  We don't know where we stand with the jet ski.
[31:45.380 --> 31:49.620]  Well, we'll we'll say we definitely have jet ski tricks that we can do.
[31:49.700 --> 31:50.840]  Maybe not the high five.
[31:50.920 --> 31:51.960]  Maybe we'll work our way up to that.
[31:52.220 --> 31:55.380]  Maybe after we show Eric our skills, he'll feel more comfortable.
[31:55.820 --> 31:58.700]  Maybe you could like an additional input on this, Gavin.
[31:58.840 --> 31:59.880]  Geoff and I were talking about it.
[31:59.920 --> 32:03.600]  I feel like the jet ski entertainment market is pretty shallow.
[32:03.600 --> 32:04.780]  I feel like we can move in.
[32:05.280 --> 32:07.460]  I feel like it's Kenny Powers, number one.
[32:07.920 --> 32:09.680]  Then you think of the guy from Tiger King.
[32:09.840 --> 32:11.900]  And I don't think I have a clear number three.
[32:12.000 --> 32:14.740]  We're like, I definitely think of this person in a jet ski thing.
[32:15.140 --> 32:19.060]  I remember Vanilla Ice being really big into jet skis.
[32:19.600 --> 32:20.320]  That being a thing.
[32:20.540 --> 32:22.420]  I don't know why, but I just remember that when I in my head,
[32:22.440 --> 32:24.220]  I associate jet skis with Vanilla Ice.
[32:24.380 --> 32:27.480]  I feel like that video of Gavin has already surpassed Vanilla Ice.
[32:27.780 --> 32:31.060]  And the jet ski thing, I think we're already on the podium of jet ski
[32:31.060 --> 32:32.400]  known for jet ski content.
[32:32.400 --> 32:36.040]  Yeah, I think we honestly, we should own the podium.
[32:36.220 --> 32:38.060]  Why do you like that video so much?
[32:38.600 --> 32:41.280]  Why do I like it or why do you like it?
[32:41.900 --> 32:45.660]  I it's just it's a silly it's a silly video.
[32:45.680 --> 32:46.900]  It's a dumb thing.
[32:46.940 --> 32:51.180]  And also without context, I just received that without any point of reference.
[32:52.060 --> 32:53.560]  That's the only thing I got.
[32:53.920 --> 32:54.900]  It's a good video.
[32:55.380 --> 32:57.220]  Yeah, I'm excited about the future of jet skiing.
[32:57.720 --> 33:01.320]  I can't wait to kick it up a notch and start diving
[33:01.320 --> 33:03.420]  into some of the cool shit we can do.
[33:03.700 --> 33:06.860]  Also, by the way, how fucking beautiful is Lake Austin and all the houses?
[33:07.120 --> 33:07.440]  Oh, my God.
[33:07.440 --> 33:10.700]  Like when you're when we're not going a thousand miles an hour, Andrew,
[33:11.160 --> 33:14.320]  there are all these little channels that you can go in off the main lake
[33:14.320 --> 33:18.060]  that are like you can go in on the jet skis like they're like no wake zone.
[33:18.160 --> 33:18.780]  So you go real slow.
[33:18.900 --> 33:22.180]  But it's through all these like there's like islands where houses are
[33:22.180 --> 33:25.920]  and you go under like covered bridges and there's crazy fucking mansions
[33:25.920 --> 33:27.080]  and all these beautiful homes.
[33:27.240 --> 33:29.880]  Yeah, that's like side streets on water.
[33:29.880 --> 33:32.320]  Like you take a little water street off the main lake
[33:32.320 --> 33:35.220]  and then you see a mansion with a volleyball court.
[33:35.940 --> 33:40.760]  It's it's a level of wealth that I would describe as absolutely disgusting,
[33:41.040 --> 33:43.340]  like filthy levels of wealth on that.
[33:43.620 --> 33:47.120]  It's it's mental just to look at the houses on there.
[33:47.380 --> 33:47.920]  It's pretty cool.
[33:48.320 --> 33:51.460]  I'm excited to film on the back of a boat
[33:51.460 --> 33:54.400]  that I assume is moving very quickly with a very expensive camera
[33:54.400 --> 33:55.460]  based off of your idea.
[33:55.860 --> 33:57.740]  Yeah, I'll give you a sturdy tripod.
[33:57.740 --> 34:01.020]  All you got to do is hit the button when Geoff and I hit the wake
[34:01.020 --> 34:02.200]  and go by each other.
[34:02.360 --> 34:05.080]  But how does real life will be like 25 feet apart?
[34:05.520 --> 34:09.080]  How does a tripod work when the thing it's resting on is shaking violently?
[34:09.400 --> 34:10.280]  Does that still help?
[34:11.840 --> 34:13.540]  The boat is bouncing everywhere.
[34:13.780 --> 34:16.420]  Like, I don't think the tripod does anything at that point.
[34:17.380 --> 34:18.900]  Sandbags, bit of rope.
[34:19.440 --> 34:20.980]  OK, I'm now excited.
[34:21.240 --> 34:24.660]  What I have in my head can't be what you possibly think this will look like.
[34:24.660 --> 34:27.820]  So I'm just excited to see what your contraption is,
[34:27.880 --> 34:28.960]  for how we're going to stabilize.
[34:29.400 --> 34:34.160]  I think if we tie, if we tie ropes, like boats have metal loops, right?
[34:34.180 --> 34:35.940]  They have little holes to put ropes through.
[34:36.040 --> 34:37.520]  That's that's what comes with a boat, right?
[34:37.960 --> 34:39.080]  Just wrap that around a tripod.
[34:39.540 --> 34:42.340]  Have you gotten to a season of Survivor where they do the challenge
[34:42.340 --> 34:45.840]  where they have to hold the bar over their shoulders and they add sandbags to it?
[34:45.920 --> 34:46.840]  They just keep adding weights.
[34:46.960 --> 34:49.940]  That's what I'm imagining your system is for how we're going to level this.
[34:50.300 --> 34:52.780]  I'm just going to have a bar on my shoulders with a bunch of sandbags
[34:52.780 --> 34:57.240]  attached, try to stabilize for you and you and Geoff to high five or do it.
[34:57.580 --> 34:58.340]  Are you a boat guy, Andrew?
[34:58.900 --> 35:00.000]  No, I'm not.
[35:00.280 --> 35:01.400]  Andrew, you went to boat school.
[35:02.080 --> 35:03.140]  You went to boating school.
[35:03.300 --> 35:04.700]  Well, I didn't I didn't go to it.
[35:04.820 --> 35:06.500]  The boating school went to my school.
[35:06.740 --> 35:08.780]  It came to me. I did not go to boat school.
[35:08.880 --> 35:12.120]  I was in normal school and they did a whole thing on boats.
[35:12.480 --> 35:13.640]  You attended boat school.
[35:13.800 --> 35:16.040]  I remember this being a big deal back when you were doing your...
[35:16.040 --> 35:19.200]  I attended school and it had a boating section that I was very
[35:19.200 --> 35:21.920]  and kind of tying into something else we talked about before.
[35:22.440 --> 35:23.860]  Knotts is where I fell apart.
[35:23.980 --> 35:27.240]  I was so determined to ace boat school or the boating classes.
[35:27.440 --> 35:30.080]  And then there was the knot section and it fell apart for me.
[35:30.100 --> 35:30.980]  I'm terrible at knots.
[35:31.260 --> 35:32.220]  Never good at it.
[35:32.400 --> 35:33.140]  Not a knot guy.
[35:35.160 --> 35:37.220]  I have a I have a new.
[35:37.380 --> 35:38.040]  This is a little thing.
[35:38.280 --> 35:42.540]  But, you know, I've been thinking about Gavin and collecting
[35:42.540 --> 35:45.580]  and how I have all my sports cards and all that nonsense.
[35:45.640 --> 35:48.320]  And Andrew, you now have your and we haven't really talked about it,
[35:48.340 --> 35:51.040]  but your burgeoning love of collecting classic video games
[35:51.540 --> 35:54.160]  and I think I've landed on I'm going to put it in the
[35:54.160 --> 35:56.300]  the perfect thing for Gavin to collect.
[35:56.840 --> 35:58.460]  I feel like this is going to be insulting.
[35:59.100 --> 35:59.580]  I don't think so.
[35:59.760 --> 36:00.180]  Is it an egg?
[36:00.480 --> 36:02.200]  It's a baseball card of an egg.
[36:02.420 --> 36:03.860]  And there's many different kinds.
[36:03.940 --> 36:07.140]  This is the Allen and Ginter Tops 2019 egg card,
[36:07.220 --> 36:09.520]  of which there's probably 30 different parallels.
[36:09.820 --> 36:11.780]  Some of it is expensive as a thousand dollars.
[36:11.980 --> 36:12.880]  That's the base egg.
[36:13.280 --> 36:14.040]  Why do you want an egg?
[36:14.160 --> 36:14.720]  Not a card.
[36:15.460 --> 36:16.440]  Why not, dude?
[36:17.000 --> 36:17.600]  I mean, why not?
[36:17.600 --> 36:18.860]  You love eggs.
[36:18.860 --> 36:21.120]  Is this the reaction that you're expecting, Geoff?
[36:21.380 --> 36:22.280]  Oh, 100%. Yeah.
[36:22.760 --> 36:23.900]  You named my cat.
[36:23.900 --> 36:24.920]  You named my cat egg.
[36:25.360 --> 36:27.520]  Yeah, but it's an owl.
[36:28.620 --> 36:29.800]  I just don't know where to start.
[36:30.080 --> 36:31.220]  Like, why isn't that one of a kettle?
[36:31.480 --> 36:32.040]  Why an egg?
[36:32.500 --> 36:34.060]  Well, because this is a famous egg.
[36:34.080 --> 36:35.460]  Why isn't that one of a wasp nest?
[36:35.760 --> 36:40.560]  Because that the wasp nest didn't get 30 million likes on Instagram or whatever.
[36:40.940 --> 36:45.000]  This is the egg from the most liked egg on the most liked thing on Instagram.
[36:45.400 --> 36:46.000]  But why is there?
[36:46.000 --> 36:47.560]  Oh, God.
[36:47.960 --> 36:49.260]  It's like culturally significant.
[36:49.420 --> 36:50.400]  So they made a card out of it.
[36:50.440 --> 36:52.700]  But there's like many different kinds of that egg.
[36:52.880 --> 36:55.000]  Oh, my God. Look at this eBay page of all the eggs.
[36:55.400 --> 36:57.280]  Yeah, see all you could collect all those different eggs.
[36:57.620 --> 36:59.280]  Eight dollar egg. Forty dollar egg.
[36:59.320 --> 37:00.060]  That one's at the top.
[37:00.100 --> 37:01.340]  One's a thousand dollar egg.
[37:01.440 --> 37:03.060]  Five hundred dollar egg.
[37:03.800 --> 37:04.920]  Eight hundred dollar egg.
[37:05.180 --> 37:08.540]  So you think I should be I should have a dozen eggs, but they're all baseball cards.
[37:08.760 --> 37:09.700]  You should be an egg man.
[37:09.820 --> 37:11.940]  You should have the you should have the collector's dozen.
[37:12.560 --> 37:13.840]  All right. Yeah, I'll start this collection.
[37:14.080 --> 37:15.520]  Oh, a grand, though.
[37:15.520 --> 37:18.060]  That's a lot for a card with a picture of an egg on it.
[37:18.200 --> 37:19.320]  Well, I hope you get lucky in a pool.
[37:19.440 --> 37:20.740]  I feel like the way to do this.
[37:20.780 --> 37:22.320]  So I'm trying to like process in my head.
[37:22.420 --> 37:26.780]  I think what we do, Geoff, and I don't want to step in on your idea in any way.
[37:27.020 --> 37:29.060]  I think we get a bunch of like egg cartons
[37:29.420 --> 37:33.920]  and we buy a bunch of different various types of eggs that are great.
[37:34.240 --> 37:35.580]  Egg cards that are graded.
[37:36.160 --> 37:40.360]  Gavin has to pick a carton and he doesn't know where the greatest egg is.
[37:40.500 --> 37:41.960]  He can end up with a bunch of rotten eggs.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  He can end up with a bunch of fucking shitty egg cards.
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.040]  You can end up with a great card.
[37:45.180 --> 37:48.140]  I feel like that's the the way to do this.
[37:48.160 --> 37:50.100]  I love that. Instead of just buying every egg.
[37:50.900 --> 37:53.500]  So I'm just throwing it out there so that I can miss out on a good egg.
[37:53.720 --> 37:56.880]  I want you to potentially open a box of rotten egg cards,
[37:56.960 --> 37:58.940]  just like the shittiest egg cards available.
[38:00.800 --> 38:03.940]  And then be like, oh, behind this box is like the PSA 10.
[38:04.040 --> 38:07.580]  This is the greatest egg card of all time, apparently, according to eBay at this moment.
[38:09.220 --> 38:12.800]  What a fucking stupid thing to put on a baseball card.
[38:12.800 --> 38:14.540]  What else is other than eggs?
[38:14.640 --> 38:16.620]  What else? That's not anything to do with baseball.
[38:16.740 --> 38:18.480]  If they put on a card. Yeah, that's a great question.
[38:18.740 --> 38:19.300]  I don't know.
[38:20.480 --> 38:21.340]  I really don't.
[38:21.440 --> 38:25.040]  Allen and Ginter, this line, they do this kind of shit every year.
[38:25.340 --> 38:26.520]  They and this isn't old.
[38:26.600 --> 38:27.620]  This isn't an old egg.
[38:27.780 --> 38:29.260]  This is 2019. Yeah.
[38:29.820 --> 38:30.840]  Well, the egg might be old.
[38:31.340 --> 38:35.480]  It's the egg that dethroned Stormy Jenner on Instagram as the most liked photo.
[38:36.000 --> 38:37.280]  Why do people care about the egg?
[38:37.820 --> 38:38.260]  I don't know.
[38:39.080 --> 38:40.960]  OK, it's just there has to be a reason.
[38:40.960 --> 38:43.740]  I just think it's I just think it's ridiculous and stupid.
[38:44.340 --> 38:48.140]  And that if I had to describe Gavin, that would be the two words I use.
[38:51.600 --> 38:53.120]  I thought you're going to expand on that.
[38:53.200 --> 38:55.740]  I thought you were going to double down on those words you would use.
[38:56.100 --> 38:57.080]  Oh, that's the word.
[38:57.660 --> 39:01.760]  And it the egg was originally posted on Instagram as an experiment
[39:01.760 --> 39:06.980]  by an unidentified Londoner and the pic soared to 30 million likes.
[39:07.040 --> 39:10.300]  So for all I know, Gavin, you could have been the one that posted the egg
[39:10.300 --> 39:11.780]  in the first place. You are also British.
[39:12.160 --> 39:13.380]  Yes, it could have been.
[39:13.420 --> 39:14.920]  That is a fact. Yeah, yeah.
[39:15.420 --> 39:17.700]  I can't argue that you are British.
[39:18.580 --> 39:19.600]  I think it might be.
[39:19.700 --> 39:21.920]  Yeah, I think that's the only classification we need.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.220]  That's the all the evidence might have just been identified.
[39:24.380 --> 39:26.320]  And he likes eggs and he likes to say the word egg.
[39:26.340 --> 39:27.640]  And he named my cat egg once.
[39:28.060 --> 39:30.560]  That's true. Is there a special word for stealing eggs?
[39:31.400 --> 39:34.140]  Hmm. Well, you know, like some items.
[39:34.860 --> 39:36.860]  It's like it's just called theft.
[39:36.900 --> 39:39.100]  But like if you steal an apple, it's scrumping.
[39:39.560 --> 39:40.640]  I didn't know that.
[39:40.900 --> 39:44.040]  No, I didn't. I didn't know apple had its own thing.
[39:44.180 --> 39:46.280]  Oh, you never was it called scrumping as a child?
[39:46.600 --> 39:48.740]  No. What is scrumping?
[39:49.320 --> 39:50.660]  Oh, is that? Is that a British thing?
[39:51.140 --> 39:52.720]  Oh, I found a new English thing.
[39:53.040 --> 39:55.400]  What is you mean? Just like picking apples?
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.420]  I thought I'm pretty sure.
[39:57.760 --> 39:58.940]  Why don't I have a lumped up scrumpy?
[39:59.040 --> 40:02.940]  I'm pretty sure it just means you've like nicked someone else's apples off their tree.
[40:03.040 --> 40:06.140]  The day the Cambridge Dictionary definition
[40:07.280 --> 40:10.780]  is to steal fruit such as apples from trees.
[40:11.940 --> 40:12.560]  Yeah. So we need to.
[40:12.780 --> 40:14.380]  What's the egg equivalent of scrumping?
[40:14.880 --> 40:15.840]  How do you scrump an egg?
[40:16.620 --> 40:18.100]  Oh, hold on. Let me Google that.
[40:18.480 --> 40:21.620]  And how do you say I'm annoyed by this?
[40:22.020 --> 40:25.200]  Oh, you see, you just you said scrumping like it was a legal term.
[40:25.420 --> 40:27.200]  Like people have gone to jail for scrumping.
[40:27.320 --> 40:29.180]  Like it is a thing that is tried.
[40:32.580 --> 40:33.700]  Well, am I wrong?
[40:33.900 --> 40:35.920]  It's it's it's a name for stealing fruit.
[40:36.440 --> 40:39.340]  It is. It is 100% a name for stealing fruit.
[40:39.660 --> 40:40.200]  Did Andrew leave?
[40:40.560 --> 40:41.320]  I think we lost him.
[40:41.760 --> 40:42.440]  No, I'm here.
[40:42.700 --> 40:43.260]  Can you not hear me?
[40:43.260 --> 40:44.020]  We lost you for a second.
[40:44.120 --> 40:45.000]  No, you lost your second.
[40:46.140 --> 40:48.140]  What was your response to what?
[40:48.540 --> 40:49.280]  Am I wrong?
[40:50.080 --> 40:51.020]  Are you wrong about what?
[40:51.080 --> 40:52.260]  I don't understand what you're asking me.
[40:53.860 --> 40:54.580]  What happened?
[40:55.140 --> 40:56.680]  I feel like I missed your question.
[40:58.180 --> 40:59.580]  Well, you disappeared again.
[41:00.300 --> 41:01.160]  What do you mean?
[41:01.440 --> 41:02.200]  What was the question?
[41:02.440 --> 41:05.140]  So I'm reading about other words for scrumping.
[41:05.140 --> 41:08.540]  I will say, if you Google, how do you scrump an egg?
[41:08.740 --> 41:09.880]  Google responds with.
[41:10.760 --> 41:14.080]  We think you mean, how do you scramble an egg in here?
[41:14.200 --> 41:14.660]  We'll tell you.
[41:14.840 --> 41:16.480]  Can the title of this episode be?
[41:16.520 --> 41:18.080]  How do you how do you scrump an egg?
[41:18.540 --> 41:25.500]  Yeah, so I didn't know.
[41:25.780 --> 41:27.320]  This is puffy.
[41:27.860 --> 41:28.900]  Nick said Humpty Dumpty.
[41:40.010 --> 41:40.790]  I didn't.
[41:40.890 --> 41:41.910]  Humpty Dumpty.
[41:43.070 --> 41:44.170]  Humpty Dumpty.
[41:46.210 --> 41:47.470]  That's another thing.
[41:47.830 --> 41:51.010]  Another reason why Gavin should love collecting eggs.
[41:51.050 --> 41:57.370]  We had the whole Humpty Dumpty discussion about like we're becoming a very egg
[41:57.370 --> 41:58.570]  centric podcast lately.
[41:59.070 --> 42:01.630]  We had shit last time and eggs this time.
[42:01.830 --> 42:03.030]  I guess the Humpty Dumpty thing.
[42:03.350 --> 42:03.550]  Yeah.
[42:04.210 --> 42:07.550]  Eric says, is there a gray area between scrumping and foraging?
[42:08.030 --> 42:08.610]  Yeah, I guess so.
[42:08.670 --> 42:10.830]  Like if it's if it's not a private tree.
[42:10.830 --> 42:11.970]  I assume it's foraging.
[42:12.630 --> 42:16.370]  If it's an owned tree or in a if you're trespassing for the apples,
[42:16.470 --> 42:17.310]  that's probably scrumping.
[42:17.850 --> 42:19.270]  Is scrumping a big problem in England?
[42:20.290 --> 42:21.650]  I don't know if it's a problem.
[42:21.790 --> 42:25.030]  I feel like it's it's just like a light crime that school kids do
[42:25.030 --> 42:27.930]  because it's a little bit cheeky because I assume most people don't give a shit
[42:27.930 --> 42:29.390]  if you take their Bramleys off the tree.
[42:29.810 --> 42:32.910]  So in America, we have like you'll go buy private property.
[42:32.990 --> 42:35.670]  You'll see signs posted that say like posted no trespassing.
[42:35.790 --> 42:37.270]  Violators will be shot, stuff like that.
[42:37.630 --> 42:40.210]  Do you see do you see in England?
[42:40.210 --> 42:43.310]  Are there signs on trees that say like no scrumping?
[42:43.770 --> 42:45.150]  Scrumpers will be prosecuted.
[42:45.770 --> 42:46.890]  Posted will be shot.
[42:47.570 --> 42:48.770]  Scrumpers will be shot on site.
[42:49.170 --> 42:53.250]  I bet I've I think there has been a no scrumping sign at some point.
[42:54.930 --> 42:57.130]  We need to make a no scrumping shirt.
[42:59.210 --> 43:03.830]  That might be if I put a no scrumping sign on my front lawn, that would
[43:04.530 --> 43:05.850]  I think that'd be excellent.
[43:06.110 --> 43:08.130]  It would be very confusing to a lot of people.
[43:08.210 --> 43:09.950]  Yeah, I'd love to hear what people say.
[43:10.490 --> 43:12.830]  We should the rule is screw the shirt.
[43:12.950 --> 43:16.310]  We should sell no scrumping yard signs that people can post in their yard
[43:16.310 --> 43:17.390]  for their private property.
[43:18.070 --> 43:21.970]  I feel like that would be such a stressful thing if you're like, OK, we got these people.
[43:22.230 --> 43:24.350]  We're putting you're in this field, OK?
[43:24.750 --> 43:25.970]  No scrumping allowed.
[43:26.030 --> 43:27.630]  If you scrump, you're out of the game.
[43:27.770 --> 43:31.270]  And just seeing what people like have to process what scrumping even means.
[43:31.290 --> 43:33.170]  I'd never guess it would be picking apples.
[43:33.470 --> 43:36.190]  I love it without the ing, like to scrump.
[43:39.010 --> 43:40.410]  You see that tree?
[43:40.490 --> 43:41.470]  He scrumped it.
[43:49.540 --> 43:52.580]  Bad fucking scrumper with his bag of apples.
[43:55.880 --> 43:57.280]  You see all those pies?
[43:59.060 --> 44:01.420]  Those pies are the product of scrumping.
[44:02.900 --> 44:05.940]  Got like black market scrumped pies.
[44:06.320 --> 44:08.940]  I love the idea of a conversation in prison.
[44:09.620 --> 44:10.880]  What are you in for?
[44:13.400 --> 44:15.380]  Scrumping, grand scrumping.
[44:16.780 --> 44:20.440]  I stole an 18 wheeler versus of eggs.
[44:21.200 --> 44:23.740]  Grant, it's grand scrump larceny.
[44:23.900 --> 44:26.280]  What is this? Oh, scrumping badges.
[44:27.880 --> 44:29.960]  Oh, bad badger scrump.
[44:30.160 --> 44:31.840]  Probably. Yeah, they're scrumpers.
[44:32.180 --> 44:35.900]  Instead of like teardrops for kills, it's apples for theft, for scrumps.
[44:37.520 --> 44:40.940]  We should we should just sell a we should make a shirt
[44:40.940 --> 44:44.220]  that has a badger with the no circle in line around it.
[44:44.280 --> 44:46.340]  It just says scrumper at the bottom of it.
[44:47.620 --> 44:51.140]  Oh, yeah. So I think the next much should be scrumping.
[44:51.640 --> 44:52.860]  Scrumper no scrumping.
[44:54.160 --> 44:55.980]  Oh, my God, that's great.
[44:56.280 --> 44:58.080]  Wow. Well, that just landed in our laps.
[44:58.160 --> 45:00.900]  That's what I hope the audience sat through the sports portion
[45:00.900 --> 45:02.600]  at the beginning of the podcast to hear this.
[45:04.860 --> 45:07.340]  Jesus, I did not expect.
[45:07.760 --> 45:12.100]  I did not expect that dumb egg baseball card, which, by the way, I bought
[45:12.580 --> 45:15.400]  six weeks ago and I've been meaning to to bring up.
[45:15.880 --> 45:18.900]  I did not expect it to go the route of scrumping that that what a gift.
[45:19.700 --> 45:20.740]  I don't. It's funny.
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.380]  So scrumping can be any tree that's owned like any fruit.
[45:24.600 --> 45:26.080]  It doesn't even have to be a tree.
[45:26.160 --> 45:28.480]  What if it's like a bush situation? Is that scrumping?
[45:28.640 --> 45:32.260]  Is it stealing the fruit off of a thing that somebody else's owns?
[45:32.600 --> 45:36.100]  Is that a book called Scrumping by Harry Newhouse?
[45:36.180 --> 45:39.940]  An erotic short story on the consequences of Apple thievery.
[45:40.380 --> 45:42.960]  Oh, my God. Is this on eBay?
[45:43.120 --> 45:44.540]  How do we get this? Yeah, it's on Amazon.
[45:45.720 --> 45:46.600]  It's free on Kindle.
[45:47.300 --> 45:50.080]  Is is the story of Adam and Eve a scrump story?
[45:50.640 --> 45:52.960]  Is that who? What was the tree?
[45:53.060 --> 45:55.120]  What do they call the original sin? The original scrump?
[45:55.880 --> 45:57.960]  Adam and Eve is the original scrump.
[45:58.300 --> 45:59.760]  That's how it all went wrong.
[46:00.120 --> 46:01.040]  Oh, my God.
[46:02.600 --> 46:05.020]  That was the origin of all sin, was a cheeky scrump.
[46:11.450 --> 46:13.710]  Original sin is a scrump.
[46:14.250 --> 46:17.950]  It's like it's like humanity began.
[46:18.610 --> 46:21.850]  According to the Bible, humanity began with scrumping.
[46:22.270 --> 46:26.850]  It's like they say that prostitution is the oldest known profession in the world.
[46:26.850 --> 46:28.350]  But it's not. It's scrumping.
[46:29.610 --> 46:33.070]  I'm just imagining somebody getting pulled over with a giant sack of apples
[46:33.070 --> 46:34.390]  in their backseat, sweating.
[46:40.670 --> 46:43.490]  You know, it's like a cop is searching something
[46:43.490 --> 46:46.550]  and they see something of criminal activity and they just grab that gun.
[46:46.730 --> 46:48.950]  And so they just see the big crate of apples.
[46:52.370 --> 46:54.690]  He like looks at it and goes, you're going pretty fast there, man.
[46:55.730 --> 46:56.370]  Everything OK?
[46:56.510 --> 46:58.010]  And I'm like, yeah, sorry, I didn't realize I was speeding.
[46:58.110 --> 47:00.590]  He sees the bag of apples in the back and he just touches them and goes, ma'am,
[47:00.850 --> 47:02.910]  he steps back and goes, ma'am, I need you to get out of the car right now.
[47:02.910 --> 47:03.570]  Get out of the car right now.
[47:03.630 --> 47:04.810]  Hands on the car, hands on the car!
[47:05.190 --> 47:08.930]  They drive by a cop car, like the lights aren't on yet, they just see it on the side of the road,
[47:09.030 --> 47:12.210]  pour the apples out, pour the apples out, they're just throwing apples out the window.
[47:16.490 --> 47:21.510]  We should, oh my god, we should read this story. We should do like a podcast, we should do like a
[47:21.510 --> 47:26.910]  f*** face, uh, shoulder episode where we just read the scrumping story for the audience.
[47:27.530 --> 47:33.170]  I think that's good. And this is maybe something to do after the jet ski stunt, we'll make a scrumped
[47:33.170 --> 47:40.210]  pie. Holy s***, I never viewed eating a pie as potentially a criminal offense, this has
[47:40.210 --> 47:47.550]  changed my life dramatically. Scrumping, wow. Oh man, I feel like I learned so much today.
[47:48.150 --> 47:54.330]  Been an educational one. So f***ing stupid. How many bullets do you have left, Andrew?
[47:55.350 --> 48:01.150]  For like things for us to talk about or my bets? Yeah, I still got my five. I have one,
[48:01.150 --> 48:04.330]  it's kind of a bigger thing that we talked about. Is it the superhero thing? Yeah,
[48:04.410 --> 48:08.390]  I feel like I'm the only one that also did the homework on that. Well, I have a, I have a,
[48:08.490 --> 48:12.370]  I, you know, I worked, you're not the only one who did the homework, I have an angle there that
[48:12.370 --> 48:16.670]  I'd like to explore, but I don't think we have time to get into the superhero thing. And Gavin,
[48:16.730 --> 48:21.210]  I don't think we've talked to you about that at all, have we? No, we did. Uh, briefly on text.
[48:21.510 --> 48:28.070]  Briefly on text, okay, yeah. Uh, I'll say this, I, uh, I survived Survivor. I finally finished
[48:28.070 --> 48:33.330]  the 21 seasons. Now I'm in a, living in a post-Survivor world. That's kind of cool. Damn,
[48:33.390 --> 48:38.230]  you sped up. I'm still on like 38. So you're just not going to watch the earlier ones? I will. I
[48:38.230 --> 48:42.230]  mean, I finished it. I wanted to get through it so that I could watch the new one and be all caught
[48:42.230 --> 48:48.070]  up. So I watched seasons 20 through 40. And when does 41 start? Like end of the month? September
[48:48.970 --> 48:53.770]  22nd, I think, or 26th. One of those days. Yeah, it's end of the month. Should we try and get
[48:53.770 --> 49:02.330]  Probst on? Oh yeah, absolutely. He could be our first guest. I don't know what I'd ask Probst.
[49:02.770 --> 49:07.550]  What would you ask Probst? Have you ever scrumped? Has anybody, tell us about the, what kind of
[49:07.550 --> 49:11.270]  scrumping goes on behind the scenes that we don't know about? Are they scrumping rice? Whenever they
[49:11.270 --> 49:15.530]  pull fruit from a tree in that show, it's not scrumping because nobody owns that, you'd assume.
[49:15.590 --> 49:19.530]  Right. I assume that's just beach. That's just the existence. All the, all the breadfruit, uh,
[49:19.530 --> 49:25.850]  is, uh, is fair game for them. Yes. We could, we could take on the responsibility of reporting all
[49:25.850 --> 49:30.430]  global scrumping. Cause I can't imagine it comes up in the news that often, but if it does, we
[49:30.430 --> 49:35.530]  should, I feel like we could report that. Has anyone been... to the listeners. What's the
[49:35.530 --> 49:40.810]  biggest consequence to a scrumper? Well, we need to read that erotic novel. It's probably anal.
[49:40.990 --> 49:45.950]  We'll find out. That apparently was about the consequences. I feel like we're going to get
[49:45.950 --> 49:50.450]  six pages into that thing and go like, this was a huge mistake. We cannot do this.
[49:51.430 --> 49:54.990]  Well, we'll need to see if we have the rights to do it, if we can legally do it. But if we can,
[49:55.310 --> 49:59.550]  I think we have to, although the comment leavers are welcome to tell us not to,
[49:59.570 --> 50:03.230]  if they don't want to hear it. Where, where does copyright, like, are we worried about copyright?
[50:03.330 --> 50:09.250]  Because it will get detected or like, can I play a snippet of an audio commentary on a movie? Or
[50:09.250 --> 50:13.870]  is that not allowed, Eric? That's, that's not allowed. Audio stuff is pretty cut and dry,
[50:13.870 --> 50:17.470]  but as far as intellectual property, I've been looking it up. As far as intellectual property
[50:17.470 --> 50:24.150]  for, uh, like an audio book style situation where we're reading something, I think we can do it.
[50:24.210 --> 50:30.370]  And also we should just do it. Wow. There you go. Eric's usually the no,
[50:30.510 --> 50:33.930]  absolutely not guy. That was a yes from the producer. We have to do it.
[50:34.190 --> 50:37.990]  I love this idea. I think we're going to get three pages. Andrew said six pages. I think we're
[50:37.990 --> 50:42.630]  getting three pages in and going, what? I'm not reading this anymore. I think that's what's going
[50:42.630 --> 50:47.350]  to happen. Where do the apples go? I guess we'll find out. I'm reading a story about scrumping.
[50:47.650 --> 50:52.630]  Look at these fucking criminals. Look at these hardened fucking criminals.
[50:53.290 --> 50:58.290]  That looks like, that looks like a job for the Vancouver child kicker. No.
[51:00.890 --> 51:04.970]  That's like a full on heist. He can de-scrump that real fast.
[51:07.230 --> 51:10.670]  I feel like that would, oh, you'd get such good air.
[51:14.250 --> 51:19.450]  If mid-scrump, I mean, specifically. Just an observation.
[51:23.710 --> 51:26.890]  I'm just thinking about it. Please stop kicking children, Andrew.
[51:26.990 --> 51:31.110]  I've never, I would never. I want to be very clear. I don't endorse it. Don't do it. I've
[51:31.110 --> 51:37.910]  never done it. I would never. You, we've seen the photo. It looks disturbingly like you.
[51:37.970 --> 51:42.530]  This is what I didn't say at that time. Okay. And this is, I feel like a key piece
[51:42.530 --> 51:48.190]  of information that will maybe change your views on that story. I had just seen It Follows
[51:48.190 --> 51:53.030]  within like the last few days. I feel like that's a big shift. That's a movie all about
[51:53.030 --> 51:58.390]  the demon thing can shape into whatever. It can look like anything. Yeah, but at this point,
[51:58.390 --> 52:01.950]  it wasn't following, it was approaching. The movie's not called It Approaches. What do you
[52:01.950 --> 52:05.170]  mean? If you're following, you approach. You certainly are approaching while following.
[52:05.290 --> 52:08.890]  It's following you behind, like when you follow someone, you're following behind them. You were
[52:08.890 --> 52:13.330]  facing it. They were following, like when I turned, they were walking towards me.
[52:13.610 --> 52:21.010]  That's fair. Yeah. How close did this person get? Within, I would say six feet. They were
[52:21.010 --> 52:25.730]  probably six feet from you. At which foot marker would you have deployed the kick?
[52:26.030 --> 52:34.250]  I would have deployed it probably at a dinklage and a half. Okay. I would have taken a step
[52:34.250 --> 52:39.230]  forward. I was giving plenty of warnings. I really, I do feel like my life would have
[52:39.230 --> 52:44.210]  dramatically shifted if I kicked that kid. I'm so glad I did. Yeah. Yeah. I think it was six
[52:44.210 --> 52:50.310]  feet away. You must have been two feet from kicking. That was very close, but it was within
[52:50.310 --> 52:55.450]  seven seconds of something happening. I would say I gave so many warning. I was trying to talk. It
[52:55.450 --> 53:01.330]  was very scary. It was an intimidating situation. I just love the six feet away and he's still
[53:01.330 --> 53:06.330]  somehow a silhouette. You had no information of his face. I feel like we moved four feet
[53:06.330 --> 53:10.750]  walking backwards and I never saw anything that looked like a face at all. It was just
[53:10.750 --> 53:16.530]  dark outline the entire move. I have never seen this before in my life, but this is fascinating.
[53:16.990 --> 53:23.070]  My two dogs are, I just looked out the window. Both of my dogs are, are perfectly next to each
[53:23.070 --> 53:27.910]  other, perfectly taking a dump at the exact same time. What's the latest on the shit? Three,
[53:27.910 --> 53:31.270]  three inches apart from each other. They're like, it's like synchronized shitting.
[53:31.790 --> 53:35.330]  That's so cool. They don't even like each other, but they shit together. That's so neat.
[53:36.030 --> 53:40.550]  How's the, what's it, how's the what now? Have you had any, uh, bad, bad dog shit experience?
[53:40.910 --> 53:48.470]  Uh, no, man. Life's been pretty shit free for me lately. Uh, knock on wood. Um, nothing like
[53:48.470 --> 53:55.650]  after that doorknob fell off. I haven't really had any house problems as of late knocking on
[53:55.650 --> 54:02.110]  wood again. Um, dogs are fine knocking on wood. Woo. Yeah. It's a, it's a, something about you
[54:02.110 --> 54:07.050]  going out of the country, um, makes my problems go too. Interesting. Well, I'll take another trip.
[54:07.130 --> 54:11.590]  We'll test it out. Well, just don't do it on fucking Thursdays. Cause I don't want to
[54:11.590 --> 54:18.030]  skip another episode. Sorry to interject randomly. I'm reading a story right now of somebody who was
[54:18.030 --> 54:23.090]  charged with scrumping. There's somebody has been, there's been a charge filed against someone.
[54:23.090 --> 54:27.530]  So the word scrumping was on the legal documents? On the legal documents.
[54:28.310 --> 54:32.190]  Goff had been charged with scrumping in the back garden of a house in Blecheiden?
[54:32.610 --> 54:39.950]  South Hampton? South Hampton? B-L-E-C-H-Y-D-E-N. Uh, magistrates taking the case at the town's
[54:39.950 --> 54:45.510]  petty sessions on August 5th, 1868 were not merciful, sentencing him to seven days hard labor
[54:45.510 --> 54:50.350]  with a warning that if he offended, he would probably be whipped. There was a serious...
[54:50.990 --> 55:00.110]  What year was this? It was in 1868, August 5th, 1868. No, this is just, Eric's asking if this
[55:00.110 --> 55:03.650]  is from the book we're going to read. No, this is just a new story I pulled up. And where was
[55:03.650 --> 55:09.770]  that from? The dailyecho.co.uk. No, I mean, okay, so it was, it was in the UK? See, this is...
[55:09.770 --> 55:13.570]  Yeah, South Hampton. This is why we fucking got, that's why we got the fuck out of there.
[55:14.130 --> 55:17.350]  This, the draconian scrumping laws. America, we were like, we gotta start our own company.
[55:17.350 --> 55:23.530]  And that's our own country. And that's why I had never heard, nor had Eric or Nick ever heard of
[55:23.530 --> 55:28.870]  scrumping because we escaped scrumping tyranny when we left England. That makes sense. Get away
[55:28.870 --> 55:36.590]  from it. I feel like this will stand now as the most mentions of the word scrump in any piece of
[55:36.590 --> 55:40.950]  media of all time. I don't think this could be beaten. We're taking the scrump podium and we're
[55:40.950 --> 55:46.730]  going to put, we'll put it right next to our, to our jet ski podium. Absolutely. I have two more
[55:46.730 --> 55:51.750]  things to say. Two points that I want to close out. They're very dated right now. Take it away.
[55:52.430 --> 55:57.090]  One, people have asked how I did with my Olympic bets. We haven't recorded since, I guess we did
[55:57.090 --> 56:02.250]  last one, but I went 11 out of 16 just to clear that up. And the second thing I want to say
[56:02.910 --> 56:10.830]  is I heard, yes, I found out, I do not listen to these, uh, that the plan to order the ice cream
[56:10.830 --> 56:15.970]  came during the chaos that was me getting the first order. And I just want to say I respect
[56:15.970 --> 56:21.410]  the move. I thought that was pre-planned. I also want to say, Geoff, I think you ordered me more
[56:21.410 --> 56:27.470]  ice cream than you anticipated. You sent me a giant two liter tub of banana ice cream. Yeah,
[56:27.490 --> 56:32.070]  it's not a big $70. Yeah. I tried to send you like a hundred dollars worth of ice cream. I assumed
[56:32.070 --> 56:38.830]  it was a lot. You sent me a double tub of banana and you sent me a small tub of banana. And so I
[56:38.830 --> 56:45.370]  didn't, I say you cookie dough too, right? Cause you don't like it. You did. I remember you saying
[56:45.370 --> 56:49.450]  that you think something like cookie dough is the ice cream that people think they like, but then
[56:49.450 --> 56:52.890]  when they have it, it's not as good as they think or something. So I tried to load you up heavy on
[56:52.890 --> 56:57.750]  that one. No, I, well, the thing is I flipped on that. I actually like cookie dough now. I reversed
[56:57.750 --> 57:02.230]  that opinion. I enjoyed that. You got me bubble gum ice cream too, which is fine, but it was more
[57:02.230 --> 57:06.350]  of an issue of you got this big tube and you got the little tube. And I opened the first ice cream
[57:06.350 --> 57:11.330]  I tried was the banana ice cream. And I'm like, Geoff loves banana flavor. This makes sense. I've
[57:11.330 --> 57:19.510]  never had banana ice cream. It's fine. I wouldn't eat this regularly. I bet you would adore this
[57:19.510 --> 57:23.230]  fucking ice cream. I had it. I'm like, I'm not going to throw this away. It's not that big of
[57:23.230 --> 57:28.130]  a container. I'll just eat this across time. It's fine. And then I opened the big container
[57:29.710 --> 57:35.670]  and my realization that this was an even bigger tub of banana ice cream was just filled with
[57:35.670 --> 57:42.010]  disappointment. I was so excited of like, I got four flavors and they're mystery. I don't know
[57:42.010 --> 57:47.810]  what they are. Where half of it was just banana ice cream. Oh, that makes my heart happy. Oh,
[57:47.890 --> 57:54.310]  that's good. Have you gone through all the ice cream yet? I ate the cookie dough. I have gotten
[57:54.310 --> 57:59.550]  rid of the majority of the banana ice cream. I've tried. I did my best. It's just too much.
[58:00.290 --> 58:05.650]  And I still have, I didn't really touch the bubblegum. How about all the sweets and pastries?
[58:06.190 --> 58:11.250]  Oh yeah, those are long. You can't keep those going. Yeah, they don't hold. My favorite part
[58:11.250 --> 58:17.050]  of that is when you stormed off the second time. You came, you were mad leaving because at this
[58:17.050 --> 58:22.390]  point it was, it was, the bit was old to you. It was very inconvenient. I just like how you came
[58:22.390 --> 58:26.470]  back the second time and I could almost picture you like smiling through your teeth. You were like,
[58:26.970 --> 58:35.730]  thanks for the ice cream. Even though you're annoyed, you said thanks. We just wanted to
[58:35.730 --> 58:40.990]  celebrate your birthday, man. Here, this is what I'm excited about. Gavin, I talked to you about
[58:40.990 --> 58:47.290]  an idea I had relating to Geoff before that. That sort of connects to this. Do you remember that?
[58:47.650 --> 58:52.750]  No. I talked to you about a thing. I'm just, I'll quickly, I'll text you what it is. Okay.
[58:52.750 --> 59:00.050]  And what Geoff did just locked in that I'm going to now do that. So I'm going to send you a quick
[59:00.050 --> 59:04.330]  text just to get your reaction. Looking at my phone. Yep. Sending it right now.
[59:07.170 --> 59:12.610]  So I, that's something that we talked about before that happened. Now this is just like,
[59:12.630 --> 59:17.450]  it's an absolute, there's going to be a response. That's a guarantee. A hundred percent. It better,
[59:17.630 --> 59:22.730]  we better be able to put it on a t-shirt. Yeah, I think we can. Okay. Okay. The last thing I
[59:22.730 --> 59:27.070]  sent you, we're, we're doing stuff with, so I think it's perfect to say. Oh my God, how cool
[59:27.070 --> 59:30.410]  does that look by the way? Yeah, it's awesome. Should we say, I didn't want to say it because
[59:30.410 --> 59:32.570]  I don't know if we're going to. Yeah, no, that's fine. I think we can say it. Okay. Yeah. We're,
[59:32.670 --> 59:38.930]  we're doing like pink porta potty mugs, like Tiki mug things, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. They look awesome.
[59:39.250 --> 59:42.870]  They look really cool. They look very cool. I don't know when those will come out, but they
[59:42.870 --> 59:47.170]  look great. I think it's been a whole thing. Like they should have been out already, but we got our
[59:47.170 --> 59:51.150]  sample back from the vendor and it wasn't up to standard. So we switched vendors and it's been a
[59:51.150 --> 59:54.750]  whole thing, but it's, I know the merch department's been working on it diligently in the background.
[59:55.110 --> 01:00:01.610]  Great. Should we wrap this up? Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. Once again, I feel like we all have so much
[01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:05.630]  stuff to talk about and it's a time issue and it's the issue of, I feel like none of us want to
[01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:10.510]  really engage in the thing because we don't have time, but we still have a lot. Yeah, we do. We
[01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:14.330]  still have a big thing. It's the thing I feared of having so much that we can't talk about it.
[01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:19.110]  That's okay. Cause we can talk about it next Thursday when we record another episode of
[01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:24.950]  F*** Face. Is that the outro? I like, I like the way you said that like Thursday is the day that, like,
[01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:29.070]  it sounds like Thursday is the day the podcast comes out on, which is very cool. No, it's just the day
[01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:33.170]  we record. Oh no, I understand that. And you understand that the people who record the show,
[01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:39.450]  the, maybe the people who listen to the show don't. Well, uh, now they do. We've, it's been
[01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:45.630]  explained to them very clearly now in this way. Thanks for listening to another episode of F*** Face.
[01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:52.170]  What about the calls to action or anything like that? We'll see you next week. Gavin, uh, why don't
[01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:55.530]  you give us the calls to action that you love so dearly? It's your favorite part of the podcast.
[01:00:55.530 --> 01:01:04.050]  I did that last time. And Andrew. Eric, pick a number between one and 60. Who, me? When I did
[01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:09.470]  this bit? No, no, no, Eric. There's no way I'm... Eric. Okay. Uh, okay. Go. Okay. Uh, okay. I'm
[01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:12.370]  ready. Can't be 19. I still have 19 left. No, I'm not. It's not 19. Okay.
[01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:21.110]  I love our ability to have an amazing moment on the podcast and then just do it again and it's
[01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:25.890]  worse. We, yeah, we're good at that. Yeah. Open the F*** Face. All right. You tell me when you're
[01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:31.110]  ready and I will hit enter. I'm ready. I got, I got, I got my hand. Ready? 47. Nope. Nope. Not even
[01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:31.690]  close. Okay. Goodbye!
