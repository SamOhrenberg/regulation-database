[00:33.080 --> 00:35.580]  Goddamn, dude. Henry just farted so bad.
[00:36.140 --> 00:37.800]  I thought he... I thought he shit...
[00:37.800 --> 00:41.360]  I thought he shit in his sleep or something. I don't think he did. Oh my god.
[00:41.360 --> 00:43.500]  Is there ever a good Henry fart?
[00:43.980 --> 00:47.360]  No, but this... this smells like baby diarrhea.
[00:48.020 --> 00:48.460]  Ugh.
[00:49.420 --> 00:52.200]  He had one the other night. I've been meaning to talk about it for a couple weeks.
[00:52.660 --> 00:56.420]  He, uh... I don't know if we've started yet, but he farted so bad.
[00:56.740 --> 00:58.440]  It was a silent fart, too.
[00:58.900 --> 01:00.660]  Mickey, you know, he kind of lays between Emily and I.
[01:01.060 --> 01:03.760]  He farted so bad, it woke her up.
[01:04.220 --> 01:06.080]  And she was, like, half asleep.
[01:06.680 --> 01:09.920]  And he just... I was, like, on my phone reading on Reddit.
[01:09.920 --> 01:12.840]  And he farted, and I was, like, oh, Christ, that was rough.
[01:13.160 --> 01:14.360]  You know, and I just barreled through.
[01:14.620 --> 01:16.900]  But she actually turned over and she was, like, ugh.
[01:17.820 --> 01:19.120]  Ugh, it's bad.
[01:20.440 --> 01:24.140]  And I went, what? And she just goes, eggs.
[01:24.280 --> 01:25.440]  And then just went back to sleep.
[01:27.140 --> 01:29.340]  I don't even think she knows she did it.
[01:29.500 --> 01:31.360]  Yeah, she farted. Or he farted.
[01:31.440 --> 01:34.620]  She woke up, rolled over, just in her sleep, said, it's so bad.
[01:34.640 --> 01:36.500]  And I said, what? And she goes, eggs.
[01:36.680 --> 01:37.860]  And then just went back to snoring.
[01:37.860 --> 01:41.060]  Was that the fart story that was postponed from last week?
[01:41.200 --> 01:41.380]  Yeah.
[01:42.760 --> 01:45.880]  I was going to tell it in a bigger way, but it's essentially...
[01:46.460 --> 01:47.180]  That's all that happened.
[01:47.980 --> 01:49.700]  We could redo that if you want.
[01:50.160 --> 01:52.780]  No, no, no, no. I just... I want to barrel through it,
[01:52.820 --> 01:54.500]  because I feel like we have so much other stuff to talk about.
[01:54.580 --> 01:56.800]  And a lingering fart story, it's, you know...
[01:56.800 --> 01:59.840]  Well, I'm just... I need to know, is there any way that you can...
[01:59.840 --> 02:02.840]  Is Henry, like, the perfect equalizer in hiding farts?
[02:02.920 --> 02:04.740]  Like, can you get farts under the radar?
[02:04.900 --> 02:06.680]  Oh, my God, dude.
[02:06.680 --> 02:07.860]  Are you kidding?
[02:08.400 --> 02:13.460]  I, you know, we have the whole thing about how my girlfriend has never shit,
[02:13.560 --> 02:16.480]  right? And how I'm pretty sure she throws it in the yard
[02:16.480 --> 02:18.040]  and I clean it up thinking it's the dog's.
[02:19.300 --> 02:23.920]  I'm reasonably sure that at least 60% of the time,
[02:23.980 --> 02:26.700]  it's her, not the dog farting. What if Henry has never farted?
[02:26.880 --> 02:30.880]  What if Henry has never farted? She woke herself up with her ex.
[02:31.280 --> 02:34.540]  Well, he definitely farted in this room a few seconds ago.
[02:34.540 --> 02:37.160]  But yeah, it's entirely possible.
[02:37.400 --> 02:42.880]  And I'm super amenable to the idea that she's been hiding his...
[02:43.340 --> 02:48.020]  She's been hiding her farts as his. Have you ever attempted to cover one of yours as his?
[02:48.480 --> 02:51.640]  No, because I don't hide farts, dude. I don't see the point.
[02:51.740 --> 02:54.940]  Yeah, I mean, you recorded them. You wanted to do a whole service around...
[02:54.940 --> 02:58.360]  I made it with my body. I don't want the world to know about my farts.
[02:59.500 --> 03:01.940]  Anyway, this is F*** Face. Welcome.
[03:01.940 --> 03:07.220]  Is this 70, right? Last one was 69. I think it's 70. I believe so.
[03:07.560 --> 03:09.280]  That's quite a lot. Where does the time go?
[03:09.720 --> 03:15.700]  Do you get the feeling that 7 looks like a way bigger number than 6 in a lot of ways?
[03:16.000 --> 03:16.540]  What do you mean?
[03:17.040 --> 03:22.080]  Like, 8 isn't tons more than 7, but 7 seems loads more than 6.
[03:22.780 --> 03:24.140]  Just the look of a 7.
[03:25.280 --> 03:28.160]  No, I'm more intimidated by an 8 than a 6.
[03:28.660 --> 03:31.480]  You think everything's pretty low and then 8 happens. It's like, whoa.
[03:31.480 --> 03:35.040]  Yeah, because a 6 is like a smaller version of an 8.
[03:35.600 --> 03:42.260]  If that 6 got jacked up, fully grown, like a fully developed... I feel like a 6 evolves into an 8.
[03:42.600 --> 03:44.760]  Yeah, I guess just 70 feels like so much more.
[03:44.760 --> 03:51.420]  You don't feel like a 6. Like, for me, a 6's balls drop and it spins and it becomes a 9.
[03:53.780 --> 03:54.860]  That's how I see it.
[03:54.860 --> 04:02.340]  Where does the 8 come in? So is an 8 completely unrelated to the 6 in the genealogy tree of these numbers?
[04:02.920 --> 04:06.280]  Are you trying to figure out which numbers had sex to make up the numbers?
[04:07.080 --> 04:09.480]  Yeah, because Geoff is bringing up a great point.
[04:09.700 --> 04:13.780]  Listen, a 7 is a 2 and a 5 fooling around.
[04:14.340 --> 04:15.380]  2 and a 5?
[04:15.560 --> 04:18.420]  Like, if a 2 and a 5 had a baby, it probably would be a 7.
[04:19.480 --> 04:23.520]  Or maybe a 1 and a 2. Maybe that's what it is. A 1 and a 2 had sex.
[04:24.140 --> 04:27.440]  No, I'm just thinking of the look of those numbers.
[04:28.180 --> 04:29.580]  I think a 7 looks harsh.
[04:30.080 --> 04:32.460]  I feel like a 7 cuts through you.
[04:33.080 --> 04:38.800]  Do you think David Fincher has any responsibility for your views of 7? Do you think that has influenced you in any way?
[04:39.140 --> 04:40.040]  I've actually never seen it.
[04:40.420 --> 04:41.220]  Really? Okay.
[04:41.620 --> 04:42.020]  No.
[04:42.460 --> 04:43.280]  I'd say that's a no.
[04:43.760 --> 04:44.280]  Good movie, though.
[04:44.700 --> 04:47.120]  It is a good movie. Does that hold up, though?
[04:47.480 --> 04:48.140]  Probably not.
[04:48.680 --> 04:50.500]  I haven't seen it in a very long time.
[04:50.500 --> 04:56.100]  What movies do you think have a funny perspective? There's some epic movies out there.
[04:56.220 --> 05:00.540]  But if you were just stood in one place for the entire movie, some of them are pretty interesting.
[05:01.420 --> 05:03.720]  Like in Interstellar.
[05:04.140 --> 05:04.760]  I haven't seen it.
[05:05.180 --> 05:14.260]  The main guy takes off in a rocket, docks it to a space station, drives the whole thing for about two years to Saturn,
[05:14.260 --> 05:21.440]  goes through a black hole, and then like 80 years later comes out without any of that shit, just floating.
[05:22.020 --> 05:23.800]  It would be weird if you were just waiting there for it.
[05:24.440 --> 05:29.620]  You would miss out on obviously all of the movie, but from that perspective, you'd be very confused.
[05:30.260 --> 05:36.000]  Do you think like the perspective of what's happening in the world of Lord of the Rings from just a hobbit we don't know?
[05:36.660 --> 05:40.300]  Well, you have to be involved somewhat. You can't just be like in another town.
[05:40.300 --> 05:44.380]  He's neighbors with the guy, like over his things occasionally.
[05:44.720 --> 05:47.160]  Do you think they have like local news? They're getting like updates?
[05:47.220 --> 05:48.820]  It's like, ah, they're working with the trees now.
[05:51.400 --> 05:53.180]  Like, what is that perspective?
[05:54.460 --> 06:01.140]  I've also been trying to figure out the ratio between the movie that is the shortest compared with how long it feels.
[06:01.340 --> 06:09.260]  And I think I've got the ultimate film for a movie that feels like it's four hours long, but it's in fact quite a neat 90 minutes.
[06:09.260 --> 06:13.140]  Yeah, I think I have one too. I need to look up how long it is. What is yours?
[06:14.060 --> 06:16.200]  Mine is Eraserhead.
[06:21.280 --> 06:24.600]  Are you going to fucking stand here or sit?
[06:24.700 --> 06:25.900]  Why are you standing right now or sitting?
[06:26.400 --> 06:26.800]  Sat.
[06:27.220 --> 06:33.960]  Are you going to sat here and tell me you and I sat there and watched Eraserhead together and you didn't like it?
[06:34.620 --> 06:37.220]  No, I thought it was very interesting, very weird.
[06:37.220 --> 06:44.500]  It's fun to watch something that is just bizarre and to the point where you're just looking at it almost just like, what is happening?
[06:44.920 --> 06:49.680]  But God damn, does that feel like a four hour movie? And it's exactly 90 minutes.
[06:50.060 --> 06:53.160]  It is exceptionally dense, that movie.
[06:54.080 --> 06:55.060]  There's a lot in there.
[06:55.880 --> 06:59.560]  And I think Black and White adds at least 45 minutes to it.
[06:59.880 --> 07:03.520]  You should see the documentary about the filming of that movie. It's really interesting.
[07:03.520 --> 07:06.520]  He shot one scene a day for five years.
[07:06.940 --> 07:07.720]  That's how he made that film.
[07:08.440 --> 07:09.500]  Sounds like a nightmare.
[07:10.160 --> 07:13.100]  Or maybe 18 months or something, but I think it was ridiculous, like five years.
[07:14.340 --> 07:20.640]  He got a grant from the Los Angeles Film Commission or one of those people.
[07:21.120 --> 07:23.720]  Or the American Film Society. It might have been the American Film Society.
[07:23.980 --> 07:31.660]  Anyway, he won or got a grant and then they let him shoot on a location, a property that they owned, but he could only shoot at night.
[07:31.660 --> 07:35.400]  So they shot one scene a night for five years.
[07:35.660 --> 07:37.760]  Weird. What a fascinating way to shoot a movie.
[07:39.840 --> 07:42.700]  It is long, but it feels longer.
[07:43.100 --> 07:45.240]  It feels like a five hour movie, The Tree of Life.
[07:45.740 --> 07:50.120]  It's a two hour, 18 minute movie. It feels like it's six hours long.
[07:50.540 --> 07:52.600]  It's very weird. I feel like it's incoherent.
[07:52.940 --> 07:56.200]  It's okay. I don't think many people listening would probably have seen it.
[07:56.280 --> 07:57.960]  It's a Terrence Malick movie. It's fine.
[07:58.560 --> 08:00.220]  Yeah, I don't think a lot of people have seen A Razorhead.
[08:04.200 --> 08:07.720]  Have you guys ever watched The Crown on Netflix?
[08:08.280 --> 08:08.460]  No.
[08:09.100 --> 08:10.940]  That's an hour long TV show.
[08:11.480 --> 08:16.760]  I challenge you to watch one hour of that show and come back and tell me it felt like one hour.
[08:16.880 --> 08:21.100]  Every time Emily's got that show on, it's like time stops. It's seven hours.
[08:21.340 --> 08:24.280]  It's like a Ken Burns documentary every episode.
[08:25.940 --> 08:28.420]  Like a full Ken Burns 10 part series.
[08:28.420 --> 08:36.500]  It's like Ken Burns baseball is crammed into 62 minutes or whatever of a fucking Netflix show.
[08:37.460 --> 08:42.020]  I have a pitch for one of the kind of an idea you're describing, Gavin.
[08:42.140 --> 08:46.040]  This is a terrible idea in my head, but I'd like to see this show.
[08:46.460 --> 08:49.440]  You're talking about a show or a perspective where nothing happens.
[08:49.900 --> 08:54.240]  I want a show in the Game of Thrones universe, but it's current day.
[08:54.800 --> 08:57.960]  And it just follows a classroom of kids and that's their history.
[08:57.960 --> 09:01.080]  Like that's just the world they live in. It's completely normal.
[09:01.240 --> 09:06.740]  It's like our world now, but their history is the fucking Daenerys and all that shit.
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.560]  But they've got like iPhones and stuff.
[09:08.760 --> 09:10.320]  Yeah, they have iPhones that are just...
[09:10.320 --> 09:14.760]  Because I think about when I was a kid in school, I didn't give a fuck about history.
[09:14.980 --> 09:19.820]  I couldn't care less. And now as an adult, I have an appreciation for how interesting it is.
[09:20.120 --> 09:26.720]  I just love the idea of what we perceive as a great drama show being the history for this world.
[09:26.720 --> 09:29.500]  And kids being like, I don't give a fuck about any of this.
[09:29.500 --> 09:35.080]  You think it'll be like how every 10th grader rolls their eyes when it's like, here we go with Nazis again.
[09:35.460 --> 09:39.100]  It's like, oh my God, these fucking White Walkers.
[09:40.780 --> 09:42.020]  I'm just so sick of it.
[09:42.140 --> 09:45.600]  You better pay attention, kid. You'd be speaking Valerian if it wasn't for these people.
[09:53.670 --> 09:55.050]  That's the show I want.
[09:55.050 --> 10:00.650]  I just think it's the concept of like that being your history and how it would impact the culture going forward.
[10:01.610 --> 10:05.550]  Also, just I like the idea of kids not appreciating because I certainly didn't.
[10:05.670 --> 10:12.490]  I didn't either. I didn't give a rat's about history. Now it's probably one of my largest interests.
[10:12.650 --> 10:13.710]  I love reading about shit.
[10:14.330 --> 10:14.530]  Yeah.
[10:14.990 --> 10:17.270]  I feel like I did school at completely the wrong time.
[10:18.030 --> 10:24.290]  Yeah, like I would love if I was going into, I don't know, 12th grade right now, I'd be pretty pumped about it.
[10:26.950 --> 10:29.630]  I'd love to be just rolling into my GCSEs right now.
[10:30.330 --> 10:34.030]  I know exactly what I wanted to do. I'd be brilliant.
[10:34.570 --> 10:37.770]  I would love for there to be a real Billy Madison like program.
[10:37.910 --> 10:39.970]  I just want to read a list. I want to do it all over.
[10:40.050 --> 10:43.930]  I feel like I've got more perspective on life. I'm more enthusiastic about learning.
[10:44.070 --> 10:46.490]  There's things I've clearly missed a lot with the shift key.
[10:46.770 --> 10:50.570]  I could use this. There's anyone who deserves a second go through.
[10:51.190 --> 10:57.570]  Shit! We just had a merch meeting and we were talking about ideas for new merch. We should come up with a shift.
[10:58.270 --> 10:59.470]  Oh, we should sell shift keys.
[10:59.470 --> 11:01.370]  Or just a shirt with just the up arrow on it.
[11:01.710 --> 11:06.170]  No, I like the idea of just selling a shift key. Just a singular key.
[11:08.250 --> 11:10.450]  Oh, like you could do this shirt as well.
[11:10.750 --> 11:14.370]  Could it just be like a giant, like the button we made, like a huge shift key?
[11:15.710 --> 11:20.190]  We could push it. And when you push it, it's just Gavin going, bullshit.
[11:22.490 --> 11:26.050]  Or Jack who doesn't... Jack doesn't believe you.
[11:26.570 --> 11:28.550]  Liar. Liar. Liar.
[11:32.490 --> 11:33.630]  That's fucking great.
[11:34.010 --> 11:37.570]  To be fair, there are a lot of keys on the keyboard that I have no idea what they do.
[11:37.830 --> 11:41.110]  And I've used a keyboard almost every day for two decades.
[11:41.110 --> 11:45.150]  I had another realization that I'm scared to talk about after the shift key thing.
[11:45.390 --> 11:50.490]  But it is something I made recently, like I'd say within the past four months or so.
[11:50.610 --> 11:53.370]  It's not new, but I just didn't know this.
[11:53.890 --> 11:55.130]  And I don't think it's a big deal.
[11:55.290 --> 11:59.450]  I think this might actually be a thing that some other people don't know.
[11:59.870 --> 12:04.610]  But Rockband. Rockband was a game. Everyone remember Rockband?
[12:04.810 --> 12:05.750]  How much fun that was?
[12:05.750 --> 12:11.950]  I had Rockband and I thought the coolest part of Rockband was the fact it had drums.
[12:12.290 --> 12:14.670]  Because the guitar here already had the guitars. I'm not going to sing.
[12:14.910 --> 12:17.890]  This is not something that interests me. But the drums are fucking cool.
[12:17.990 --> 12:20.030]  You can just smash these things. It's great.
[12:20.850 --> 12:25.490]  I did not realize that you could just hold the pedal down and continue to play.
[12:25.770 --> 12:31.510]  I thought you could only use the pedal when that note would appear in the game track to hit it.
[12:32.110 --> 12:32.870]  I had no clue.
[12:34.690 --> 12:39.130]  What was the pedal for? Was it for holding down the cymbal part?
[12:39.570 --> 12:40.750]  No, it was like the kick drum.
[12:41.070 --> 12:42.570]  It was like to kick the drum.
[12:44.170 --> 12:47.310]  I think when you properly play, I think as Eric is saying,
[12:47.810 --> 12:49.450]  I think that's how you properly play the drums.
[12:49.570 --> 12:53.090]  You just hold the pedal down and then you release and kick when you need to.
[12:53.690 --> 12:56.550]  So whenever that would scroll through, I would click it.
[12:56.790 --> 12:58.630]  The problem is my foot would cramp up.
[12:58.670 --> 13:00.890]  Because you're not supposed to keep your foot at that angle.
[13:00.890 --> 13:03.510]  So I could play like two or three songs and I'd be in pain.
[13:03.690 --> 13:06.050]  I'd be like, this sucks. I wish this was fun.
[13:06.350 --> 13:09.850]  I went through my whole life of rock band thinking I couldn't do that.
[13:10.010 --> 13:12.770]  I thought if I held it down, it would fuck up the other notes I hit.
[13:13.030 --> 13:14.670]  And it caused so much discomfort.
[13:14.870 --> 13:16.910]  And I realized like four months ago, you could just hold it down.
[13:17.610 --> 13:21.290]  I think that's okay. Also, are you still playing rock band?
[13:21.770 --> 13:24.230]  No, but I talked to somebody about rock band the other day.
[13:25.790 --> 13:27.310]  It blew my mind at the time.
[13:27.570 --> 13:29.150]  You don't have room for rock band in your room.
[13:29.570 --> 13:30.270]  No, you do not.
[13:30.730 --> 13:32.370]  No, I don't. I really don't.
[13:33.490 --> 13:34.250]  It's a problem.
[13:34.970 --> 13:37.910]  Eric says people are pissed about the shift key.
[13:38.430 --> 13:40.010]  Are they? I feel like we went over that.
[13:40.410 --> 13:42.430]  I don't know if they're pissed about the shift key or not.
[13:42.510 --> 13:46.050]  But I do think the idea of shift keys as a merch is funny.
[13:46.130 --> 13:48.210]  Or maybe people should mail you their shift keys. I don't know.
[13:48.910 --> 13:49.770]  There's definitely something there.
[13:49.770 --> 13:51.090]  Why would they mail me my shift keys?
[13:51.890 --> 13:54.270]  So you can use them. Because now you know how shift works.
[13:54.630 --> 13:55.830]  But they do. That's a great point.
[13:56.070 --> 13:57.990]  That's where I was going with this.
[13:59.330 --> 14:03.130]  Scrump has become a global phenomenon already.
[14:03.790 --> 14:07.710]  The world has embraced scrumping in a big way.
[14:08.290 --> 14:09.870]  We're very excited about scrumping.
[14:10.250 --> 14:13.590]  I saw a lot of stuff on the Instagram stories of people picking apples.
[14:15.750 --> 14:21.870]  Today is Thursday, September 16th when we're recording this.
[14:22.370 --> 14:25.210]  I believe that this coming up Tuesday,
[14:25.570 --> 14:31.170]  we will be picking up our metallic scrump yard signs.
[14:31.410 --> 14:32.110]  So that we can sell them.
[14:32.990 --> 14:36.530]  We are going to sell notice no scrumping metal signs.
[14:37.150 --> 14:39.410]  Eric's typing and he's either about to say yes, that's correct.
[14:39.490 --> 14:40.830]  Or Geoff, you weren't supposed to talk about that.
[14:40.830 --> 14:42.390]  Number four on the image.
[14:42.970 --> 14:45.990]  It's a black, white and red sign that says notice no scrumping.
[14:46.490 --> 14:48.230]  It will be in the store, I guess next week.
[14:48.810 --> 14:50.310]  I would love to have that on my lawn.
[14:50.530 --> 14:52.630]  I just feel like it would make my neighbors talk to me though.
[14:52.710 --> 14:53.990]  Which is not something I want.
[14:54.510 --> 14:54.830]  Right.
[14:56.510 --> 14:59.290]  Do you think that old lady who threw the cucumbers would come to the door?
[14:59.430 --> 15:01.230]  She saw the sign, she needs a clarification.
[15:02.530 --> 15:06.230]  I don't know what scrumping is, but I hope it's not throwing cucumbers at your house.
[15:07.870 --> 15:09.310]  Maybe she scrumped those cucumbers.
[15:09.310 --> 15:10.670]  That's why she was trying to shift them.
[15:12.410 --> 15:16.990]  Andrew, I was thinking about another thing that is very frequently used.
[15:17.070 --> 15:18.450]  But I think some people don't know it.
[15:18.770 --> 15:22.090]  When you reply to an email, what does it put in the subject line?
[15:22.550 --> 15:23.990]  I don't even know how to answer that question.
[15:24.050 --> 15:24.390]  What do you mean?
[15:24.750 --> 15:28.670]  When I answer an email, what does it put in the subject line?
[15:28.850 --> 15:29.770]  This isn't the question.
[15:29.890 --> 15:31.850]  I just want you to understand what I'm talking about.
[15:32.090 --> 15:33.430]  It has the subject of an email.
[15:33.570 --> 15:35.650]  When you hit reply, it changes the subject.
[15:35.810 --> 15:36.650]  It adds two letters.
[15:36.650 --> 15:37.830]  It does?
[15:38.350 --> 15:38.430]  Yeah.
[15:40.490 --> 15:42.570]  Do you really not know what two letters it adds?
[15:42.910 --> 15:43.150]  No.
[15:44.090 --> 15:46.950]  I replied to an email a minute ago.
[15:46.970 --> 15:51.430]  So it defeats the misconception that some people have about the two letters.
[15:51.810 --> 15:53.330]  Give me a second.
[15:54.290 --> 15:55.070]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[15:55.450 --> 15:55.590]  Yeah.
[15:56.810 --> 15:57.650]  What does that mean?
[15:58.410 --> 16:00.110]  Well, fuck, now I need to think about it.
[16:00.110 --> 16:01.170]  Let's think about this for a minute.
[16:01.170 --> 16:01.570]  Okay.
[16:02.590 --> 16:06.930]  So my initial just gut read on this would be responding to email.
[16:08.790 --> 16:09.270]  RE.
[16:10.110 --> 16:10.970]  Response, maybe?
[16:11.130 --> 16:11.830]  Could be that.
[16:11.970 --> 16:13.290]  Some of those are tricky.
[16:13.490 --> 16:15.390]  You'd think it'd be RES if it was response.
[16:15.610 --> 16:16.530]  But it might just be RE.
[16:17.130 --> 16:18.210]  It's not Resident Evil.
[16:18.530 --> 16:20.010]  That's also something that comes to mind.
[16:20.110 --> 16:21.090]  I can narrow that out.
[16:24.190 --> 16:27.490]  Gavin, I didn't think this was something people didn't know until this moment.
[16:28.130 --> 16:29.630]  Andrew definitely doesn't know.
[16:30.490 --> 16:31.170]  RE.
[16:31.430 --> 16:32.070]  Returning?
[16:32.450 --> 16:33.910]  Return email?
[16:34.510 --> 16:35.290]  Could that be it?
[16:36.570 --> 16:37.930]  Because you're responding.
[16:39.510 --> 16:41.670]  Imagine email as a physical good.
[16:42.110 --> 16:46.950]  I feel like most people think it's for reply.
[16:47.710 --> 16:48.510]  Oh, okay.
[16:49.370 --> 16:51.290]  Respond kind of in the same...
[16:51.290 --> 16:53.790]  It's like second plate and reply would be first.
[16:54.370 --> 16:55.230]  It's in the same thing.
[16:55.690 --> 16:58.630]  But it's regarding and then the subject.
[16:58.630 --> 16:59.470]  Oh.
[16:59.710 --> 17:01.330]  So that's the misconception.
[17:01.570 --> 17:04.090]  So not only did you not understand what I was saying at the beginning,
[17:04.350 --> 17:07.450]  your misconception was completely different anyway.
[17:07.750 --> 17:08.570]  I don't know why I asked.
[17:10.430 --> 17:12.670]  Eric says he still thinks it's Resident Evil.
[17:14.330 --> 17:18.290]  I feel like all of mine outside of Resident Evil joke answer better than regarding.
[17:18.930 --> 17:19.530]  I don't say regarding.
[17:20.230 --> 17:21.510]  I don't say regarding.
[17:21.970 --> 17:24.330]  I don't say regarding.
[17:24.330 --> 17:26.610]  I say in regards to fairly often, I think.
[17:26.610 --> 17:29.050]  Sure. Okay. That's acceptable.
[17:29.610 --> 17:30.650]  I just don't like regarding.
[17:31.990 --> 17:33.610]  It's not a rotational word for me.
[17:33.670 --> 17:34.970]  Hey, you know what?
[17:35.050 --> 17:36.550]  If you don't like it, we won't say it.
[17:36.590 --> 17:38.670]  How about that? We will ban that word from this show.
[17:38.990 --> 17:40.150]  I don't think we need to ban it.
[17:40.190 --> 17:42.950]  I'm just saying if I'm writing an email, I feel like there are a lot better options.
[17:43.050 --> 17:44.410]  Who decided it means regarding?
[17:45.030 --> 17:45.670]  Who made that choice?
[17:45.710 --> 17:46.830]  It's not from email, I don't think.
[17:46.910 --> 17:49.610]  I assume it's from old writing.
[17:50.010 --> 17:53.210]  I learned it in a letter writing class in 5th grade or something.
[17:53.510 --> 17:54.250]  What do you mean?
[17:54.910 --> 17:56.870]  Like when you learn how to write letters.
[17:57.030 --> 17:58.730]  Professional letters and shit in school.
[17:58.950 --> 17:59.590]  Like when I was a kid.
[18:00.090 --> 18:02.010]  I learned RE meant regards or regarding.
[18:02.610 --> 18:04.030]  Huh. Okay.
[18:04.390 --> 18:06.430]  See, my confusion was I was thinking about
[18:06.430 --> 18:08.110]  did people send letters back and forth?
[18:08.470 --> 18:09.410]  Like the same letter?
[18:09.950 --> 18:11.590]  Like a reply email but physical?
[18:12.330 --> 18:13.930]  Because in my head, that makes no sense.
[18:14.270 --> 18:16.050]  But to do regarding...
[18:16.050 --> 18:18.130]  So they write you a letter and then you just write
[18:18.130 --> 18:19.550]  regarding the letter you sent?
[18:20.110 --> 18:21.170]  How would you use that?
[18:21.170 --> 18:22.370]  You would say like
[18:22.370 --> 18:25.010]  RE that question you asked or whatever.
[18:25.970 --> 18:26.970]  Yeah, because back then
[18:26.970 --> 18:29.410]  when you responded to a letter, if you were using new paper
[18:29.410 --> 18:31.230]  you wouldn't quote the
[18:31.230 --> 18:32.830]  entire letter under your response.
[18:33.170 --> 18:35.350]  So you actually had to say this is what I'm replying to.
[18:35.690 --> 18:37.170]  Yeah, I don't think
[18:37.170 --> 18:39.290]  I'd ever write a letter with the intent of having
[18:39.290 --> 18:41.250]  it be a continued conversation. That seems like
[18:41.250 --> 18:43.010]  a lot of work. Oh, you're one and done.
[18:43.250 --> 18:43.790]  Don't talk to me again.
[18:45.490 --> 18:47.230]  It's like, imagine a
[18:47.230 --> 18:49.170]  volley in a tennis game but every game
[18:49.170 --> 18:51.190]  is a different match. I don't expect
[18:51.190 --> 18:52.690]  the continuation of the conversation.
[18:53.190 --> 18:54.550]  What if you were writing to someone
[18:54.550 --> 18:56.290]  and you asked a bunch of stuff
[18:56.290 --> 18:59.250]  and then you only needed a response for one thing.
[18:59.310 --> 19:01.090]  They would probably write what they were responding to.
[19:01.350 --> 19:03.230]  Yeah, well, I feel like I don't need them to say
[19:03.230 --> 19:05.370]  regarding this. I feel like I could just get the answer.
[19:05.450 --> 19:06.770]  I wrote to them. I know what I wrote.
[19:07.170 --> 19:08.910]  So if someone replied to something you wrote
[19:08.910 --> 19:10.030]  and they just wrote for,
[19:10.910 --> 19:12.510]  wouldn't you be like, what are they talking about?
[19:12.810 --> 19:14.110]  Well, nobody would do that though.
[19:14.430 --> 19:16.270]  They wouldn't say regarding.
[19:16.270 --> 19:18.350]  They would just be like,
[19:18.430 --> 19:20.350]  I want, I don't know,
[19:20.490 --> 19:22.450]  what are we talking about? How many apples have you
[19:22.450 --> 19:24.330]  scrumped recently? If I asked that.
[19:24.430 --> 19:26.470]  And if they replied for, I'd understand what that meant.
[19:26.630 --> 19:28.430]  Yeah, I would. I would. I wouldn't need
[19:28.430 --> 19:30.350]  them to say, in regards to the
[19:30.350 --> 19:31.690]  scrumping, for.
[19:31.690 --> 19:32.570]  I wonder
[19:34.210 --> 19:36.450]  what your quality of life would have
[19:36.450 --> 19:38.270]  been like in a world before the internet.
[19:38.490 --> 19:40.290]  Like 30 years ago. I think Andrew was born
[19:40.290 --> 19:42.190]  at the correct time. I think so too.
[19:42.270 --> 19:44.490]  I really do. I wonder how he would navigate
[19:44.490 --> 19:45.430]  a pre,
[19:46.430 --> 19:48.230]  convenience of modern internet world.
[19:48.550 --> 19:50.430]  No, I would adapt. If I grew up in a different
[19:50.430 --> 19:52.430]  time, I'd be a different me. I don't think you can measure
[19:52.430 --> 19:54.370]  current Andrew as opposed to a different
[19:54.370 --> 19:56.470]  time period Andrew. So what caused you?
[19:57.010 --> 19:58.230]  What is, I don't, uh,
[19:58.510 --> 20:00.410]  what, like, what do you mean?
[20:00.690 --> 20:02.410]  How is it conceived? Well, you're saying you wouldn't be like
[20:02.410 --> 20:04.450]  the way you are if you were knocking about
[20:04.450 --> 20:05.670]  with the Tudors and stuff.
[20:06.410 --> 20:08.370]  I don't understand. What caused me?
[20:08.850 --> 20:09.850]  Yeah, like, you're you,
[20:10.070 --> 20:12.230]  but why? Like, who sculpted you?
[20:12.230 --> 20:14.370]  Yeah, why? My environment?
[20:14.590 --> 20:16.550]  I guess? I don't know. That's such a weird...
[20:16.550 --> 20:18.230]  What do you mean? What's the biggest impact? Is it like
[20:18.230 --> 20:20.510]  your school friends? Is it your parents?
[20:20.770 --> 20:22.350]  I think all of it impacts
[20:22.350 --> 20:24.050]  you to an extent. I think, yeah,
[20:24.130 --> 20:26.130]  kind of the era you live in, the people around you,
[20:26.190 --> 20:28.310]  your parents, your background. I think all that kind
[20:28.310 --> 20:29.950]  of shapes you into the person you are.
[20:30.510 --> 20:32.190]  And then you kind of acquire
[20:32.190 --> 20:33.810]  your own experiences as you get older.
[20:34.330 --> 20:36.410]  Oh, man. Don't let me forget.
[20:36.590 --> 20:38.050]  I don't want to change the subject from this, but
[20:38.050 --> 20:40.450]  I had a new experience in Vegas
[20:41.270 --> 20:42.750]  that I have got to share with you guys
[20:42.750 --> 20:43.050]  later.
[20:44.470 --> 20:46.310]  I lost my train of thought. I just think,
[20:46.430 --> 20:48.590]  you know, I bet you I'd be fucking great at writing
[20:48.590 --> 20:50.610]  letters if I was in a letter time. I'd have a
[20:50.610 --> 20:52.610]  quill. I'd get it all fancy. I'd have
[20:52.610 --> 20:54.470]  a nice ink. That's what we did. That's what we did before
[20:54.470 --> 20:55.630]  the internet. We used quills.
[20:56.770 --> 20:58.550]  But you wouldn't ever type
[20:58.970 --> 20:59.870]  R-E colon.
[21:00.410 --> 21:02.130]  No. No, I wouldn't.
[21:02.630 --> 21:03.730]  I think it'd be outrageous.
[21:04.590 --> 21:06.490]  In my head, a letter is you kind of
[21:06.490 --> 21:08.630]  put all your thoughts out there, and then they acknowledge
[21:08.630 --> 21:10.610]  some of it and put all their thoughts. It's not really
[21:10.610 --> 21:12.110]  an ongoing conversation. You don't volley.
[21:12.690 --> 21:14.670]  It's a different thing. You definitely volley.
[21:14.890 --> 21:16.750]  We definitely used to volley in letters.
[21:17.070 --> 21:18.190]  Nah. I'm not sure.
[21:18.370 --> 21:20.770]  That's how you would have conversations with people far away,
[21:20.890 --> 21:22.950]  man, if you didn't want to pay a thousand dollar phone bill.
[21:23.270 --> 21:24.610]  Well, yeah, I mean, at the... yeah.
[21:25.050 --> 21:26.550]  I'm just saying now. I'm saying
[21:26.550 --> 21:28.770]  my perception of what letters are in the environment
[21:28.770 --> 21:30.850]  I grew up in. If I grew up in a different...
[21:30.850 --> 21:32.730]  If I was in the letter time... If I was in the
[21:32.730 --> 21:33.630]  letter days...
[21:34.390 --> 21:36.710]  The olden times. The letter era.
[21:36.710 --> 21:37.670]  I
[21:39.270 --> 21:40.970]  will say, regardless
[21:40.970 --> 21:42.810]  of when I was
[21:42.810 --> 21:45.130]  born, I'd never understand how faxing
[21:45.130 --> 21:46.550]  works. Nope. No.
[21:46.850 --> 21:48.930]  That's just a thing that would never work in my
[21:48.930 --> 21:50.670]  head. Couldn't process that.
[21:52.150 --> 21:52.890]  I'd never
[21:52.890 --> 21:54.790]  fax. You've never understood fax?
[21:55.130 --> 21:56.790]  I'd never be a faxer. You gotta
[21:56.790 --> 21:58.870]  put a phone number in or something. It seems
[21:58.870 --> 22:00.250]  very unnecessarily complicated.
[22:01.110 --> 22:02.330]  You think that's less convenient than
[22:02.330 --> 22:04.630]  writing and then mailing a letter?
[22:04.630 --> 22:06.690]  Yeah, because as I think I've talked
[22:06.690 --> 22:08.770]  about on this show before, mail terrifies
[22:08.770 --> 22:10.510]  me. I don't understand how any of it works.
[22:10.630 --> 22:12.770]  It's just magic. It's the equivalent of magic
[22:12.770 --> 22:14.530]  to me. I feel like mail is the
[22:14.530 --> 22:16.370]  easiest thing to understand. You physically
[22:16.370 --> 22:18.570]  write mail and then someone takes it
[22:18.570 --> 22:20.490]  to where you write. It doesn't involve a
[22:20.490 --> 22:22.110]  modem. It doesn't involve bits.
[22:22.150 --> 22:24.510]  It doesn't involve silicon in any way. It's the
[22:24.510 --> 22:26.530]  process that blows my mind. That I could write
[22:26.530 --> 22:28.570]  a letter to France and they would be able to deliver
[22:28.570 --> 22:30.570]  it accurately and I could depend on that. And all
[22:30.570 --> 22:32.510]  I have to do is write an address on it and put some
[22:32.510 --> 22:34.730]  stamps and I'm good. But sending a text
[22:34.730 --> 22:36.470]  wirelessly to someone in
[22:36.470 --> 22:38.110]  France, that's easy. That's
[22:38.110 --> 22:40.430]  not magic. Well no, that is
[22:40.430 --> 22:40.670]  ma-
[22:42.290 --> 22:44.470]  It's all magic, but there's
[22:44.470 --> 22:46.210]  a physical component to it.
[22:46.430 --> 22:48.430]  The fact that somebody's having to hold my
[22:48.430 --> 22:50.330]  letter and move it like it's touching
[22:50.330 --> 22:51.650]  several people's hands.
[22:52.430 --> 22:54.310]  There's like a level of personal
[22:54.310 --> 22:56.330]  touch to mail that I think is
[22:56.330 --> 22:58.650]  wild. Where just
[22:58.650 --> 23:00.330]  sending a text is fucking
[23:00.330 --> 23:02.130]  crazy. It's ridiculous.
[23:02.510 --> 23:04.330]  It's amazing that that's a thing that
[23:04.330 --> 23:06.330]  can happen, but it's just not...
[23:07.470 --> 23:08.350]  There's so many...
[23:08.350 --> 23:10.390]  I don't know. There's so many ways a letter
[23:10.390 --> 23:12.330]  can go wrong. And I don't feel
[23:12.330 --> 23:13.710]  the same way about a text.
[23:14.110 --> 23:16.310]  Yeah, I guess to a point
[23:16.310 --> 23:18.230]  there's no way your text will like
[23:18.230 --> 23:20.470]  fall down the back of a trolley and get
[23:20.470 --> 23:22.050]  stuck behind a wall for ten years.
[23:22.390 --> 23:24.510]  Exactly. I had, listen, I ordered
[23:24.510 --> 23:26.170]  popcorn from Toronto
[23:26.170 --> 23:28.470]  once. I got it from across fucking
[23:28.470 --> 23:30.610]  Canada. And they shipped it and just
[23:30.610 --> 23:32.450]  got lost. My text, if it gets
[23:32.450 --> 23:34.510]  lost, I get a little symbol on it and I can
[23:34.510 --> 23:36.550]  resend it a minute later. My popcorn
[23:36.550 --> 23:38.330]  was lost for weeks.
[23:38.830 --> 23:39.870]  Weeks it was lost.
[23:40.130 --> 23:42.530]  It'd be weird if you had the same speed
[23:42.530 --> 23:44.250]  of feedback to lost mail.
[23:44.390 --> 23:46.510]  You ordered the popcorn and ten
[23:46.510 --> 23:48.490]  seconds later it's like, we lost it.
[23:51.990 --> 23:54.430]  I found it. I got the popcorn. It was just in a warehouse.
[23:54.570 --> 23:56.470]  They forgot it existed, I think, because I complained
[23:56.470 --> 23:58.630]  and then it showed up the next day, but then I was like,
[23:58.630 --> 23:59.950]  is this fresh popcorn?
[24:00.130 --> 24:02.330]  How do I judge the quality of this thing?
[24:02.370 --> 24:04.410]  It was very good. I'd recommend the honey mustard popcorn.
[24:04.830 --> 24:06.310]  Very good. Of course you would.
[24:06.790 --> 24:08.650]  Yeah, it's good. Buttered, also
[24:08.650 --> 24:08.910]  good.
[24:13.850 --> 24:15.010]  Are you the kind of person
[24:15.010 --> 24:16.990]  who falls asleep already thinking
[24:16.990 --> 24:18.610]  about the next morning's coffee?
[24:19.070 --> 24:20.550]  Well, I am. Yes to that question.
[24:20.910 --> 24:22.850]  Would you consider yourself a certified
[24:22.850 --> 24:25.130]  coffee nerd or a professed
[24:25.130 --> 24:26.150]  coffee newbie?
[24:26.730 --> 24:28.230]  I would say I'm somewhere
[24:28.230 --> 24:29.570]  in the... I'm certainly not a newbie.
[24:30.150 --> 24:31.410]  I don't know that I'm a... I don't
[24:31.410 --> 24:34.030]  take my coffee as seriously as the people of Australia
[24:34.030 --> 24:36.430]  or anything, but I'm into it. I dig my coffee.
[24:36.790 --> 24:38.210]  Either way, you need to hear about
[24:38.210 --> 24:40.010]  trade, okay? Geoff, tell me about trade.
[24:40.190 --> 24:42.330]  Okay, Geoff, I will. Does your at-home
[24:42.330 --> 24:44.210]  coffee just not live up to your expectations?
[24:44.470 --> 24:46.390]  Ooh, hitting you right at home
[24:46.390 --> 24:47.710]  where it hurts. They know.
[24:48.790 --> 24:50.190]  Sure, in public you'll be like,
[24:50.250 --> 24:52.170]  no, my at-home coffee's just
[24:52.170 --> 24:54.290]  fine, why would you ask? But they know what's going on
[24:54.290 --> 24:55.850]  behind closed doors. Interesting.
[24:56.450 --> 24:57.810]  Seems like trade can change that.
[24:58.090 --> 25:00.490]  Trade's goal is to make every cup of coffee
[25:00.490 --> 25:02.330]  your best ever. Why, that sounds
[25:02.330 --> 25:03.950]  like a really worthwhile goal.
[25:04.430 --> 25:06.370]  I could get into that. The journey
[25:06.370 --> 25:08.390]  to your perfect cup starts with taking their
[25:08.390 --> 25:10.430]  coffee quiz... oh, I like taking quizzes.
[25:10.890 --> 25:12.210]  Those are always fun. You find out like,
[25:13.050 --> 25:14.350]  uh... you know, which
[25:14.350 --> 25:16.250]  member of Seinfeld are you? Or what's
[25:16.250 --> 25:18.310]  the perfect cup of coffee? Use a French press?
[25:18.430 --> 25:19.810]  Automatic drip? I have both.
[25:20.070 --> 25:21.990]  Are you a cold brew person? You know I am.
[25:21.990 --> 25:24.010]  Not a problem. Your answers will allow
[25:24.010 --> 25:25.970]  trade to pair you with the perfect
[25:25.970 --> 25:27.610]  coffee to fit your tastes.
[25:28.390 --> 25:30.070]  All of this talk has got
[25:30.070 --> 25:31.870]  me wanting coffee now. Trade will
[25:31.870 --> 25:33.970]  match you to coffees you'll love from
[25:33.970 --> 25:35.850]  400-plus craft coffees
[25:35.850 --> 25:37.990]  and will send you a freshly roasted bag
[25:37.990 --> 25:39.810]  as often as you'd like.
[25:40.030 --> 25:41.810]  Wow, that's pretty fantastic, actually.
[25:42.470 --> 25:44.050]  Uh... what's the catch? There's no
[25:44.050 --> 25:45.910]  catch. That's awesome. Give feedback
[25:45.910 --> 25:47.970]  as you sip. As your preferences evolve,
[25:48.050 --> 25:49.750]  your coffee matches will too.
[25:49.750 --> 25:51.790]  Oh, man, that's like the Netflix
[25:51.790 --> 25:53.730]  algorithm. It gets smarter and smarter
[25:53.730 --> 25:55.970]  the more you rate. The better... you know, the more it goes.
[25:56.090 --> 25:57.810]  That's... that's good. You can feel good
[25:57.810 --> 25:59.630]  about each cup since Trade partners with
[25:59.630 --> 26:01.650]  more than 55 small U.S.-based
[26:01.650 --> 26:03.630]  roasters who are committed to ethical and
[26:03.630 --> 26:05.370]  sustainable sourcing.
[26:05.870 --> 26:07.550]  Huh. I'm pretty jazzed about this.
[26:07.830 --> 26:09.710]  For our listeners, right now, Trade

[26:29.610 --> 26:31.450]  off your bundle. Enjoy!
[26:31.870 --> 26:33.730]  We all shop online. Hopefully,
[26:34.190 --> 26:35.510]  we all shop on the Rooster Teeth website
[26:35.510 --> 26:37.710]  store. But, regardless of whether we do
[26:37.710 --> 26:40.090]  or not, we're shopping somewhere online.
[26:40.390 --> 26:41.890]  I've already shopped online.
[26:42.250 --> 26:43.690]  It's, uh, 1.42
[26:43.690 --> 26:45.670]  in the afternoon, Central Time, uh, in
[26:45.670 --> 26:47.370]  Austin, Texas. I have already bought
[26:47.370 --> 26:49.490]  three things today from
[26:49.490 --> 26:51.770]  two different online websites.
[26:52.510 --> 26:53.670]  And we've all seen
[26:53.670 --> 26:55.450]  that promo code taunt us at checkout.
[26:55.750 --> 26:57.690]  I did just today, as a
[26:57.690 --> 26:59.170]  matter of fact. But thanks to Honey,
[26:59.450 --> 27:01.730]  manually searching for coupon codes is a thing
[27:01.730 --> 27:03.490]  of the past. What's that?
[27:03.690 --> 27:05.430]  Oh, it's in the rear view mirror. You can't even see it anymore.
[27:05.590 --> 27:07.730]  You're so far... it's so far behind
[27:07.730 --> 27:09.470]  you. Honey, it's like
[27:09.470 --> 27:11.390]  you're graduating college
[27:11.390 --> 27:13.410]  and they're talking about high school.
[27:13.410 --> 27:15.030]  It's ridiculous it's so far behind you.
[27:15.410 --> 27:17.530]  Honey is the free shopping tool that scours
[27:17.530 --> 27:19.610]  the internet for promo codes and applies the best
[27:19.610 --> 27:20.950]  one it finds to your cart.
[27:21.390 --> 27:23.310]  Honey supports over 30,000 stores
[27:23.310 --> 27:25.510]  online. That is more stores
[27:25.510 --> 27:27.270]  than you will shop at in your lifetime.
[27:27.470 --> 27:29.430]  I am reasonably, reasonably
[27:29.430 --> 27:31.390]  certain. Although, that's not a
[27:31.390 --> 27:33.470]  challenge. I'm not trying to tell you to buy at 30,000 stores.
[27:34.110 --> 27:34.890]  You do you.
[27:35.230 --> 27:37.270]  Just know that if you do
[27:37.270 --> 27:39.390]  buy from any of those 30,000 stores,
[27:39.470 --> 27:41.110]  Honey will support you. Here's how it works.
[27:41.110 --> 27:43.130]  Imagine you're shopping on one of your favorite
[27:43.130 --> 27:45.010]  sites. When you check out, the Honey button
[27:45.010 --> 27:47.070]  drops down, and all you have to do
[27:47.070 --> 27:48.470]  is click Apply Coupons.
[27:49.130 --> 27:50.170]  Wait a few seconds.
[27:52.190 --> 27:53.150]  As Honey searches
[27:53.150 --> 27:54.950]  for coupons, it can find on that site
[27:54.950 --> 27:56.930]  and then if Honey finds a working coupon,
[27:57.730 --> 27:59.330]  you'll watch the prices drop.
[28:03.350 --> 28:03.810]  Savings!
[28:06.550 --> 28:07.470]  I'm responsible
[28:07.470 --> 28:08.770]  with my money.
[28:10.530 --> 28:11.090]  I'm responsible with my money.
[28:11.090 --> 28:13.030]  You've heard me talk about how much
[28:13.030 --> 28:15.090]  my girlfriend and I saved on our stand-up
[28:15.090 --> 28:16.990]  paddle boards until you're blue in the face.
[28:17.090 --> 28:18.990]  I brag about it constantly, thanks to Honey.
[28:19.250 --> 28:21.270]  But, just today, I got some stuff
[28:21.270 --> 28:22.770]  with like a 10% discount.
[28:23.270 --> 28:25.170]  I'm not going to tell you what I bought today, because that's my
[28:25.170 --> 28:25.990]  business, not your business.
[28:26.670 --> 28:29.030]  It certainly wasn't related
[28:29.030 --> 28:31.210]  to collectible pewter
[28:31.210 --> 28:33.210]  spoons, or metal
[28:33.210 --> 28:35.250]  or ceramic thimbles. But, regardless,
[28:35.490 --> 28:36.390]  I did receive some savings.
[28:37.370 --> 28:38.830]  I encourage you to as well.
[28:38.830 --> 28:41.010]  And if you don't already have Honey, you could be straight up
[28:41.010 --> 28:43.150]  missing out on these savings. It is literally
[28:43.150 --> 28:44.910]  free and it installs in a few
[28:44.910 --> 28:46.890]  seconds and by getting it, you're going to be
[28:46.890 --> 28:48.830]  doing yourself a solid and you'll support this
[28:48.830 --> 28:51.030]  podcast. I'd never recommend something I don't
[28:51.030 --> 28:52.930]  use. Get Honey for free at
[28:52.930 --> 28:54.890]  joinhoney.com slash face.
[28:55.050 --> 28:56.930]  That is joinhoney.com
[28:56.930 --> 28:58.050]  slash face.
[28:59.450 --> 29:00.990]  Hey, I got a question
[29:00.990 --> 29:03.010]  now that we're 25 minutes in.
[29:03.310 --> 29:04.110]  Jesus Christ!
[29:04.370 --> 29:06.710]  What do you guys want to talk about in this episode?
[29:06.710 --> 29:08.790]  I would like to briefly talk
[29:08.790 --> 29:09.850]  about the fact that
[29:10.610 --> 29:12.630]  I thought Andrew was doing a bit
[29:12.630 --> 29:14.730]  over text. And this just makes it
[29:14.730 --> 29:16.630]  even better. Imagine this being
[29:16.630 --> 29:17.990]  written and delivered and
[29:17.990 --> 29:20.730]  the carbon footprint involved
[29:20.730 --> 29:22.030]  if this was done over post.
[29:24.150 --> 29:24.670]  Andrew
[29:26.150 --> 29:26.670]  wrote...
[29:27.530 --> 29:28.670]  Wait, wait, wait a second.
[29:28.810 --> 29:30.790]  Before you say that, let me
[29:30.790 --> 29:32.770]  just ask Geoff. Geoff, who
[29:32.770 --> 29:34.570]  performed the Keenan and Kel rap?
[29:34.570 --> 29:36.470]  I have no idea what you're talking about.
[29:36.650 --> 29:38.390]  See? I'm
[29:38.390 --> 29:40.230]  way too old for that shit.
[29:40.470 --> 29:42.190]  I know who those actors are.
[29:42.590 --> 29:44.830]  Geoff doesn't even remember we talked about this.
[29:45.130 --> 29:46.610]  Oh my god. Did we talk
[29:46.610 --> 29:47.690]  about the Keenan and Kel rap?
[29:49.270 --> 29:50.970]  Did that last episode
[29:52.170 --> 29:53.010]  just not
[29:53.010 --> 29:53.470]  happen?
[29:55.050 --> 29:56.430]  What's going on?
[29:58.410 --> 29:58.750]  Are you
[29:58.750 --> 30:00.970]  both doing a bit? Now I'm going nuts.
[30:01.710 --> 30:02.470]  Now I'm going crazy.
[30:02.470 --> 30:04.450]  Did we talk about Keenan and Kel last week?
[30:04.670 --> 30:06.150]  Yes! Oh my god!
[30:06.590 --> 30:08.550]  Why would we talk about that? I don't pay attention.
[30:08.630 --> 30:10.010]  I don't watch that shit.
[30:10.670 --> 30:12.110]  I can't believe it.
[30:13.050 --> 30:14.570]  I'm so glad I stopped it.
[30:15.910 --> 30:16.350]  Gavin!
[30:16.890 --> 30:18.550]  I rode a roller
[30:18.550 --> 30:20.590]  coaster with Keenan. Was that what we were talking about?
[30:21.130 --> 30:22.590]  Oh my god.
[30:22.690 --> 30:24.330]  I thought Andrew was doing a bit because
[30:24.330 --> 30:26.710]  I thought it would be insane that he didn't...
[30:26.710 --> 30:26.970]  Oh.
[30:28.310 --> 30:29.510]  Andrew, out of nowhere,
[30:29.510 --> 30:31.510]  a day after we recorded
[30:31.510 --> 30:32.630]  last week,
[30:33.450 --> 30:33.930]  said,
[30:34.910 --> 30:37.430]  you didn't mention Coolio does the Keenan
[30:37.430 --> 30:38.950]  and Kel rap. That's wild.
[30:39.390 --> 30:41.430]  I just wrote, considering we just
[30:41.430 --> 30:43.790]  talked about it the day before, is this a bit?
[30:44.170 --> 30:45.550]  He said, did you mention
[30:45.550 --> 30:47.970]  that yesterday? And I just said, this is a bit.
[30:48.190 --> 30:49.590]  And then he wrote, I'm very confused.
[30:49.890 --> 30:51.050]  Back and forth, blah, blah, blah.
[30:51.170 --> 30:53.610]  I checked the freaking episode.
[30:53.970 --> 30:55.670]  I mentioned Coolio by name
[30:55.670 --> 30:57.650]  three times while I was telling
[30:57.650 --> 31:00.050]  the story about how I was stuck in a simulation.
[31:00.710 --> 31:02.010]  No one heard it!
[31:02.150 --> 31:03.230]  Did anyone hear that? No!
[31:03.930 --> 31:05.610]  You were stuck in a simulation
[31:05.610 --> 31:07.810]  because shit kept conveniently
[31:07.810 --> 31:09.470]  popping up after you talked about it.
[31:09.510 --> 31:11.590]  I remember that. I think it was the other way,
[31:11.670 --> 31:13.850]  but yeah, I at least remember that we discussed
[31:13.850 --> 31:14.950]  the Keenan and Kel rap.
[31:15.370 --> 31:17.770]  I somehow missed the fact that
[31:17.770 --> 31:18.770]  it was Coolio.
[31:18.990 --> 31:20.890]  Three times! By name!
[31:21.430 --> 31:23.490]  I feel like I remember Coolio
[31:23.490 --> 31:24.970]  more than Keenan and Kel.
[31:24.970 --> 31:26.850]  You didn't remember any of it!
[31:26.990 --> 31:28.410]  We just went through this, what do you mean?
[31:28.870 --> 31:30.490]  Well, no, he said Coolio.
[31:31.130 --> 31:32.510]  Coolio's jogging my memory
[31:32.510 --> 31:33.770]  a little bit.
[31:34.710 --> 31:36.790]  Or maybe it's just that we've talked about
[31:36.790 --> 31:38.690]  Coolio on Instagram in the past. Maybe that's what I'm remembering.
[31:38.690 --> 31:40.870]  Have we ever taken his account yet? Isn't that the plan?
[31:41.070 --> 31:42.730]  Was I? Can I ask a question?
[31:42.770 --> 31:44.930]  Was I in this episode? Yeah. Yeah, you were there.
[31:45.290 --> 31:46.450]  Yeah, you've been in every one.
[31:47.070 --> 31:48.650]  That I know about. That's true.
[31:48.690 --> 31:50.910]  I guess, well, wait, was there one that
[31:50.910 --> 31:52.990]  we did? Oh no, you weren't there for part of one.
[31:52.990 --> 31:54.210]  I forgot about that.
[31:54.870 --> 31:56.510]  Remember that? You weren't there.
[31:57.350 --> 31:59.070]  We did the thing where
[32:00.050 --> 32:00.990]  Geoff left and
[32:00.990 --> 32:02.790]  then for some reason we all came back and it was
[32:02.790 --> 32:04.750]  Eric, Kevin, and I, I think, and we
[32:04.750 --> 32:06.830]  threw the beginning, the intro.
[32:07.410 --> 32:08.970]  Yeah, I don't think we talked about Coolio
[32:08.970 --> 32:11.050]  there, though. No, we didn't. It was just the point
[32:11.050 --> 32:12.890]  Geoff said, was I there for it, and I said
[32:12.890 --> 32:14.990]  you've been in every episode. How's, uh...
[32:15.570 --> 32:16.670]  How's Coolio doing these days?
[32:17.130 --> 32:18.950]  That's a great question. We still haven't overtaken
[32:18.950 --> 32:21.110]  his Instagram, according to Eric. We gotta catch up
[32:21.110 --> 32:23.090]  on that. Damn. I just, I
[32:23.090 --> 32:25.130]  love, I love that you didn't even fucking remember it.
[32:25.410 --> 32:26.870]  Gavin was gonna make fun of me for
[32:26.870 --> 32:29.090]  not hearing the Coolio thing. You had no
[32:29.090 --> 32:31.110]  idea what we're talking about. No. I just don't
[32:31.110 --> 32:33.270]  understand. Is this the best
[32:33.270 --> 32:35.130]  gaslighting in all the world? Is this
[32:35.130 --> 32:37.410]  the best performance of all time?
[32:37.610 --> 32:38.990]  I need to say that I'm wrong.
[32:39.070 --> 32:41.130]  I need to apologize right now. What Geoff just
[32:41.130 --> 32:43.030]  did made me realize that
[32:43.030 --> 32:45.150]  regarding is essential. Regarding
[32:45.150 --> 32:46.890]  is an essential part of the letter.
[32:47.210 --> 32:49.150]  You need to include it in the context.
[32:49.150 --> 32:50.750]  What made you figure that out?
[32:52.010 --> 32:53.130]  Right, right
[32:53.130 --> 32:55.150]  now. Holy shit. Cause there'd be
[32:55.150 --> 32:57.350]  six letters just explaining who Coolio
[32:57.350 --> 32:57.690]  is.
[32:59.090 --> 33:01.430]  I apologize. I'm wrong about that.
[33:01.670 --> 33:01.970]  Wow.
[33:02.630 --> 33:04.510]  That was a perfect full circle.
[33:04.650 --> 33:07.010]  That was a mid-episode retraction.
[33:07.150 --> 33:08.510]  That's awesome. That was fun.
[33:09.130 --> 33:10.250]  Very mature of you, Andrew.
[33:10.930 --> 33:12.990]  I didn't, I've never encountered
[33:12.990 --> 33:15.090]  what you just did. I thought you'd
[33:15.090 --> 33:17.070]  know. I was kinda honestly trying to
[33:17.070 --> 33:18.890]  tee myself up to look more foolish
[33:18.890 --> 33:20.570]  and then you were like, I don't even know.
[33:21.550 --> 33:22.790]  And then I was like,
[33:22.830 --> 33:24.150]  hold my root beer.
[33:26.770 --> 33:27.490]  God damn.
[33:30.290 --> 33:31.050]  Oh shit.
[33:31.270 --> 33:32.090]  This is a dumb show.
[33:32.870 --> 33:34.210]  Was that your point?
[33:34.830 --> 33:36.850]  You said it a bunch, Gavin. I didn't hear it.
[33:36.950 --> 33:38.910]  Is that what you wanna talk about?
[33:39.190 --> 33:41.130]  Well, my point was gonna be, can you believe Andrew
[33:41.130 --> 33:42.230]  didn't hear Coolio?
[33:42.790 --> 33:44.930]  And Geoff was gonna be like, yeah, he mentioned it
[33:44.930 --> 33:46.570]  two or three times. And suddenly,
[33:46.810 --> 33:47.910]  my point out the window.
[33:50.110 --> 33:51.330]  This isn't regarding
[33:51.330 --> 33:52.830]  to last week's episode, right?
[33:53.090 --> 33:55.130]  My point was down the back of a trolley
[33:56.290 --> 33:57.170]  by the wall.
[33:59.650 --> 34:00.990]  So what happened in Vegas, Geoff?
[34:01.450 --> 34:02.190]  Oh, okay.
[34:02.690 --> 34:04.670]  So here's what we need to discuss.
[34:04.730 --> 34:06.390]  A couple things. We're running out of time.
[34:07.270 --> 34:08.950]  First off, let me just get this out of the way.
[34:09.010 --> 34:10.050]  There's not gonna be any arguments.
[34:10.350 --> 34:12.470]  There's not gonna be any disruption about it.
[34:12.470 --> 34:13.590]  We're just gonna barrel
[34:14.350 --> 34:16.230]  through this, Andrew, and you're not gonna
[34:16.230 --> 34:17.130]  fuck this up for me.
[34:18.090 --> 34:19.630]  Gavin, you don't even have to say anything.
[34:20.830 --> 34:21.870]  October 1st, the
[34:22.310 --> 34:24.250]  bat knobs go on sale
[34:24.250 --> 34:25.850]  on the Rooster Teeth store.
[34:26.550 --> 34:27.530]  That's all I'm gonna say.
[34:27.850 --> 34:29.850]  October 1st, the bat knobs go for sale.
[34:30.090 --> 34:32.470]  Maybe you get an extra item, maybe you don't.
[34:32.530 --> 34:33.870]  You got like a 1 in 10 chance
[34:34.330 --> 34:35.750]  of maybe we'll throw in something extra.
[34:35.890 --> 34:38.010]  But if you buy a bat knob on October 1st,
[34:38.010 --> 34:40.150]  you'll get a bat knob and maybe something else.
[34:40.150 --> 34:41.450]  That's all. Okay.
[34:41.770 --> 34:44.070]  Are you gonna call these bat handles
[34:44.070 --> 34:45.770]  bat knobs on the store? Yes, yes.
[34:46.290 --> 34:47.490]  We're gonna call them bat knobs.
[34:48.350 --> 34:50.210]  I went to Vegas for Andrew.
[34:50.670 --> 34:51.530]  Need to talk about that.
[34:51.830 --> 34:54.190]  Something happened to me in Vegas that's very embarrassing.
[34:54.390 --> 34:55.270]  I need to talk about that.
[34:56.030 --> 34:58.230]  I discovered a new thing that I like to do
[34:58.230 --> 35:00.110]  way too much. And then Gavin
[35:00.110 --> 35:00.990]  and I came up with
[35:01.850 --> 35:04.410]  a modified stunt we wanna do.
[35:04.590 --> 35:06.370]  And we've got some homework for you,
[35:06.450 --> 35:08.310]  Andrew. I think that we need to cover
[35:08.310 --> 35:10.430]  all that shit. I'm very excited about the homework.
[35:10.670 --> 35:12.450]  Can I just... I don't know if we should
[35:12.450 --> 35:13.170]  talk about it.
[35:13.910 --> 35:16.010]  In an extensive way, I will say that
[35:16.010 --> 35:17.650]  we had the merch meeting today
[35:18.150 --> 35:20.210]  and we laid out everything. And I believe
[35:20.210 --> 35:21.730]  Geoff, you're like, okay, we all agree.
[35:22.050 --> 35:23.970]  Just as a heads up, we're gonna explain this to Gavin.
[35:24.110 --> 35:26.110]  He's gonna immediately challenge
[35:26.110 --> 35:28.130]  what is being said, what we all agreed upon.
[35:28.290 --> 35:30.270]  I wasn't vocal in the meeting. Some of it
[35:30.270 --> 35:31.810]  still doesn't make sense to me. Oh, I know.
[35:31.950 --> 35:34.330]  I know. A little bird told me
[35:34.330 --> 35:36.390]  later that you were having post-meeting
[35:36.390 --> 35:37.850]  issues. That's why I said
[35:37.850 --> 35:39.770]  we're just gonna barrel through it.
[35:41.290 --> 35:42.390]  Order a knob!
[35:42.690 --> 35:44.390]  Get a knob! Maybe it
[35:44.390 --> 35:46.410]  comes with a logo device. I don't
[35:46.410 --> 35:48.330]  know, but you buy a knob, you get
[35:48.330 --> 35:50.030]  a knob. And it'll be numbered.
[35:50.750 --> 35:51.870]  I don't know what to say.
[35:52.930 --> 35:54.310]  I think they should all come
[35:54.310 --> 35:56.270]  in the same box. Regardless of
[35:56.270 --> 35:57.710]  if the logo device is there or not.
[35:58.750 --> 35:59.870]  Whatever you say, buddy.
[36:00.270 --> 36:01.190]  What are you talking about?
[36:02.190 --> 36:04.390]  Oh! Can I talk about
[36:04.390 --> 36:06.450]  something unrelated that was sort of brought up
[36:06.450 --> 36:08.370]  at the merch meeting? Yeah. I don't know if we should
[36:08.370 --> 36:10.470]  talk about this. We could edit this out, I guess, if we want
[36:10.470 --> 36:12.450]  to. How many baseballs do
[36:12.450 --> 36:14.170]  you think Geoff could consecutively
[36:14.170 --> 36:16.150]  swing at Gavin before he just broke?
[36:16.650 --> 36:18.290]  If he's in a batting cage. And he's
[36:18.290 --> 36:20.450]  trying to... he's like going for a home run every time?
[36:20.650 --> 36:22.330]  Yeah, if he's swinging, he's trying to make
[36:22.330 --> 36:24.410]  good contact on each ball, how many
[36:24.410 --> 36:26.230]  times do you think he could swing before
[36:26.230 --> 36:28.310]  his arms give out? Fifty?
[36:28.730 --> 36:30.310]  Geoff thinks he can swing at a
[36:30.310 --> 36:31.130]  thousand balls.
[36:34.010 --> 36:34.450]  Okay.
[36:34.950 --> 36:36.570]  We weren't going to talk about that,
[36:36.630 --> 36:38.650]  because that's a whole other lane
[36:38.650 --> 36:39.570]  we want to go into.
[36:40.030 --> 36:41.550]  I do think I can swing.
[36:42.330 --> 36:43.170]  There's no way!
[36:43.950 --> 36:45.030]  There's no way!
[36:45.430 --> 36:46.990]  What, are you going to be there for two days?
[36:48.690 --> 36:49.990]  And Eric's over here going,
[36:50.070 --> 36:51.790]  there's even more baseball stuff. Listen,
[36:51.870 --> 36:54.210]  we're going to get derailed on the baseball team.
[36:54.710 --> 36:56.110]  Yes, yes, there's
[36:56.110 --> 36:58.350]  more baseball stuff. Yes, I think I...
[36:58.350 --> 37:00.190]  We were discussing what to sell
[37:00.190 --> 37:01.610]  next, and
[37:02.130 --> 37:04.090]  Andrew had mentioned that it seems weird
[37:04.090 --> 37:06.010]  that we have all this other baseball
[37:06.010 --> 37:08.090]  shit, we don't have a baseball, and then Eric
[37:08.090 --> 37:10.230]  brought up, we're not a baseball
[37:10.230 --> 37:12.230]  podcast, which is a fair
[37:12.230 --> 37:14.250]  point, and then it would
[37:14.250 --> 37:16.350]  have to make sense, and I said, I had the idea
[37:16.350 --> 37:17.950]  a couple weeks ago, that
[37:17.950 --> 37:20.250]  what if we sold baseballs, what if I
[37:20.250 --> 37:21.990]  hit each baseball with a bat first?
[37:22.150 --> 37:24.270]  So each bat came, each ball came
[37:25.370 --> 37:26.010]  pre-hit,
[37:26.310 --> 37:27.050]  pre-tested,
[37:27.050 --> 37:28.970]  uh, like
[37:28.970 --> 37:31.050]  pre-dinged, right? And then
[37:31.050 --> 37:33.090]  they were asking me how many I thought
[37:33.090 --> 37:34.250]  I could hit, and I was like, I could
[37:34.790 --> 37:36.630]  hit a thousand baseballs, sure.
[37:37.330 --> 37:38.970]  I didn't say I could do it all at once,
[37:39.030 --> 37:40.510]  but I can, and I would.
[37:40.670 --> 37:43.030]  No, the scenario you proposed
[37:43.030 --> 37:45.110]  was like one time in a dugout
[37:45.110 --> 37:46.990]  just swinging away. What I loved
[37:46.990 --> 37:48.910]  about it is Geoff said it so
[37:48.910 --> 37:51.010]  confidently, and then somebody quietly
[37:51.010 --> 37:52.910]  in the meeting was like, you know, maybe we
[37:52.910 --> 37:54.550]  could just sell like 200 of them.
[37:54.550 --> 37:56.190]  We don't have to do a thousand.
[37:56.870 --> 37:58.750]  Like they were concerned about your health.
[37:59.130 --> 38:00.710]  There's just no way you can swing
[38:00.710 --> 38:02.670]  a thousand. That's also a good point.
[38:02.810 --> 38:04.430]  That's a good point that
[38:04.890 --> 38:06.610]  Nick brings up, or Eric brings up.
[38:06.670 --> 38:08.210]  I only have to try to hit them.
[38:08.490 --> 38:10.430]  If I strike out, that still counts.
[38:10.770 --> 38:12.430]  We just won't sell that one for as much.
[38:13.070 --> 38:15.050]  So you can own a baseball
[38:15.550 --> 38:16.950]  that went past
[38:16.950 --> 38:18.670]  Geoff. We'll separate the
[38:18.670 --> 38:20.550]  hit balls versus the strikeout
[38:20.550 --> 38:22.570]  balls and the home run balls. You can pick
[38:22.570 --> 38:24.470]  one or the other. Oh my god, you would hit like
[38:24.470 --> 38:26.450]  70 balls and then you would just be ripping
[38:26.450 --> 38:28.450]  the boxes open and just thumping like 10
[38:28.450 --> 38:29.710]  at once. I don't know.
[38:30.010 --> 38:32.550]  I don't know. And this all
[38:32.910 --> 38:34.110]  goes back to this other
[38:34.110 --> 38:36.510]  I'm gonna do this, my girlfriend and I got into an argument
[38:36.510 --> 38:37.530]  about something and
[38:39.230 --> 38:40.750]  she's very fucking motivated
[38:40.750 --> 38:41.730]  to make it happen.
[38:42.310 --> 38:42.890]  Let me ask you
[38:43.930 --> 38:46.610]  I didn't think we were gonna talk about this, but Gavin, let me ask you a question.
[38:46.690 --> 38:48.690]  How hard, how fast
[38:48.690 --> 38:49.610]  do you think you can throw a baseball?
[38:50.430 --> 38:51.850]  Oh, probably not very.
[38:52.130 --> 38:53.710]  And I'll say this, a Major League
[38:53.710 --> 38:55.830]  Baseball, like a Major League Baseball
[38:55.830 --> 38:57.530]  player throws a fast ball
[38:58.010 --> 38:59.550]  anywhere from 92
[38:59.550 --> 39:01.090]  to 100 miles an hour, typically.
[39:01.930 --> 39:03.410]  I bet I could do 60.
[39:03.830 --> 39:04.230]  Okay.
[39:05.450 --> 39:06.930]  So Gavin's a reasonable person.
[39:07.490 --> 39:10.030]  I think you could do 60 as well, I don't think that's a lot at all.
[39:10.030 --> 39:11.110]  I'm not throwing a thousand balls!
[39:11.730 --> 39:12.510]  No, you just got to throw one.
[39:13.610 --> 39:15.710]  How fast could you throw it though? You think you could throw it 60
[39:15.710 --> 39:17.570]  miles an hour? I thought this was me
[39:17.570 --> 39:18.930]  serving you up for hitting a wall.
[39:19.430 --> 39:21.630]  No, no, no, no, just how fast could you throw
[39:21.630 --> 39:23.550]  a baseball? It's unrelated. It's madness
[39:23.550 --> 39:25.550]  in a different way, Gavin. It's unrelated
[39:25.550 --> 39:26.470]  but equally insane.
[39:28.290 --> 39:29.290]  Yeah, I'm gonna say 60.
[39:29.830 --> 39:31.610]  Okay. I don't know if that's good or not.
[39:31.910 --> 39:33.570]  I mean, if they're doing 90, then that's
[39:34.230 --> 39:35.530]  barely anything in comparison.
[39:36.450 --> 39:36.950]  What about you?
[39:38.190 --> 39:38.990]  Uh, well...
[39:39.550 --> 39:41.050]  I'm reasonably certain
[39:41.770 --> 39:43.350]  that I could throw a baseball
[39:44.370 --> 39:45.170]  with training
[39:45.170 --> 39:46.610]  I gotta take into consideration
[39:47.010 --> 39:49.230]  you know, I fell on the shoulder
[39:49.230 --> 39:50.010]  last year
[39:50.010 --> 39:52.550]  in the bike rack
[39:52.550 --> 39:55.150]  and I had that MRI and I have a
[39:55.770 --> 39:57.070]  troubling amount of arthritis
[39:57.070 --> 39:59.230]  right? So I'm gonna have to put myself
[39:59.230 --> 40:01.310]  on a regimen of stretching
[40:02.110 --> 40:02.590]  and
[40:03.270 --> 40:04.590]  probably, yeah,
[40:04.750 --> 40:07.210]  definitely at least a month of stretching
[40:07.210 --> 40:08.410]  and maybe some
[40:09.110 --> 40:11.250]  range of motion exercise. Imagine me sending a bit
[40:11.250 --> 40:13.290]  of post saying how fast could you throw the ball
[40:13.290 --> 40:14.770]  and I got that in response.
[40:16.530 --> 40:17.330]  Regarding the
[40:17.330 --> 40:19.310]  baseball speed... You know, on the back side of the letter
[40:19.310 --> 40:20.330]  you had to flip it over
[40:20.330 --> 40:21.710]  and he still qualified.
[40:24.250 --> 40:25.050]  Regarding that
[40:25.050 --> 40:27.450]  I think I can throw a baseball at 80 miles
[40:27.450 --> 40:29.430]  an hour. Oh my god, really?
[40:30.070 --> 40:31.290]  I think so. There's no way.
[40:32.130 --> 40:33.190]  There's a 0% chance.
[40:33.970 --> 40:35.630]  You can train all you want. There's no way.
[40:36.050 --> 40:37.350]  My girlfriend bought a baseball
[40:37.350 --> 40:39.070]  that records the speed you throw it at.
[40:39.290 --> 40:41.290]  So I can, at some point...
[40:41.890 --> 40:43.770]  What's your fastest so far?
[40:43.930 --> 40:45.190]  I haven't done it at all yet.
[40:46.150 --> 40:46.630]  Wait.
[40:47.430 --> 40:49.310]  You own a baseball that measures
[40:49.310 --> 40:51.310]  its own speed and you've never threw it yet?
[40:51.710 --> 40:52.270]  That's correct.
[40:53.390 --> 40:55.330]  Huh. I don't under... Why would
[40:55.330 --> 40:56.290]  you not throw it immediately?
[40:56.770 --> 40:57.750]  Go and do it now.
[40:58.910 --> 41:01.510]  I don't know where Emily put it
[41:01.510 --> 41:03.310]  and no, because then I'll know
[41:03.310 --> 41:05.210]  the... No, I wanna...
[41:05.210 --> 41:07.690]  Because then you'll see 52 and then you'll be like...
[41:07.690 --> 41:09.370]  First off, if we do
[41:09.370 --> 41:11.650]  that, I gotta fuckin... It's gotta be filmed.
[41:12.230 --> 41:13.070]  This is gonna be content
[41:13.070 --> 41:15.490]  if we're gonna do this. That's fair.
[41:15.670 --> 41:17.430]  It won't register when it goes 49.
[41:18.050 --> 41:19.370]  No. I'm gonna...
[41:21.490 --> 41:23.150]  And besides, we'll have Gavin...
[41:23.150 --> 41:25.430]  Gavin can film it with the Phantom and then he can just speed it up
[41:25.430 --> 41:26.730]  to whatever looks like 80 miles an hour.
[41:28.830 --> 41:29.510]  You want me
[41:29.510 --> 41:31.230]  to time-lapse you with the Phantom?
[41:34.270 --> 41:35.310]  I feel like the ball
[41:35.310 --> 41:36.310]  will be going slow enough.
[41:36.310 --> 41:38.350]  Anyway, if this is
[41:38.350 --> 41:40.110]  something we're into, I'm already...
[41:40.110 --> 41:41.870]  I've already got this going on with my girlfriend.
[41:42.210 --> 41:44.330]  We can always turn it into a bit for...
[41:45.250 --> 41:45.930]  Eric's into it.
[41:46.130 --> 41:48.350]  So I was gonna offer it to you guys. If you guys want it to be
[41:48.350 --> 41:50.430]  a thing, we can make that happen. I'd love for it to be
[41:50.430 --> 41:51.930]  a thing. I appreciate that.
[41:52.350 --> 41:54.270]  It would be like if you watched Usain Bolt
[41:54.270 --> 41:56.490]  run and was like, I could be three seconds
[41:56.490 --> 41:58.210]  slower. Like, it's ridiculous.
[41:58.490 --> 41:58.990]  Like, what do you mean?
[42:00.310 --> 42:02.410]  We should all put in what number we think
[42:02.410 --> 42:04.230]  you're gonna throw at. And I don't think the Phantom
[42:04.230 --> 42:06.110]  should film the ball. The Phantom
[42:06.110 --> 42:08.270]  should film your face when you look at the speed.
[42:10.090 --> 42:12.410]  Whoever gets the closest to my actual number
[42:13.410 --> 42:13.850]  wins
[42:13.850 --> 42:16.090]  a thousand swings at baseball bat.
[42:17.490 --> 42:18.290]  It'd be awesome.
[42:19.670 --> 42:20.570]  I would say
[42:20.570 --> 42:22.330]  you're... I don't think throwing
[42:22.330 --> 42:24.270]  is a strength of yours, Geoff, but flicking
[42:24.270 --> 42:25.690]  you're very good at.
[42:26.070 --> 42:28.250]  You're one of the hardest flickers that I've met.
[42:28.590 --> 42:29.490]  If that makes you feel good.
[42:29.690 --> 42:32.350]  I'm a pretty good thrower. I wouldn't have
[42:33.470 --> 42:33.870]  uh...
[42:33.870 --> 42:36.110]  I wouldn't have said I could do it if I didn't think I could do it.
[42:36.550 --> 42:37.890]  80 though. 80?
[42:38.730 --> 42:40.170]  If I can't throw 80
[42:40.170 --> 42:42.050]  I get goddamn close.
[42:42.430 --> 42:44.290]  That means that if a car drove by
[42:44.290 --> 42:46.190]  you at 70 miles an hour, you could
[42:46.190 --> 42:48.150]  throw a ball and hit it while it was
[42:48.150 --> 42:50.170]  driving away from you. I would assume
[42:50.170 --> 42:50.690]  so, yes.
[42:53.110 --> 42:54.010]  I love this.
[42:54.310 --> 42:56.430]  I think an important question, Geoff. How far
[42:57.470 --> 42:58.150]  are you willing
[42:58.150 --> 43:00.330]  to train? To what extent are you
[43:00.330 --> 43:01.990]  willing to attempt to go for this?
[43:02.970 --> 43:04.230]  That's a great question, Andrew,
[43:04.350 --> 43:06.430]  and I'll tell ya. It's all gonna come down
[43:06.430 --> 43:08.390]  to how much it hurts to throw
[43:08.390 --> 43:10.250]  the baseball the first time once
[43:10.250 --> 43:12.290]  because it is going to hurt
[43:12.290 --> 43:14.630]  a lot. Like, I can't...
[43:14.630 --> 43:16.310]  Listen, I got
[43:16.310 --> 43:18.550]  issues with the shoulder. So I know it's gonna be painful
[43:18.550 --> 43:19.830]  first of all.
[43:20.410 --> 43:22.170]  So if I
[43:22.170 --> 43:23.910]  throw it and it doesn't hurt so much
[43:23.910 --> 43:26.250]  and my first throw is like 62 miles
[43:26.250 --> 43:28.270]  an hour or something, then I'll be like, oh, I'll
[43:28.270 --> 43:30.290]  train for a couple weeks. If I throw it, my arm
[43:30.290 --> 43:32.250]  almost falls off and I throw it 48 miles an hour,
[43:32.350 --> 43:33.210]  then it's gonna be months.
[43:34.950 --> 43:36.250]  Eric just said, we play baseball
[43:36.250 --> 43:38.230]  on Saturdays. You're welcome to join us to see that you
[43:38.230 --> 43:40.370]  absolutely can't throw 80. I'm now rooting
[43:40.370 --> 43:42.170]  for a world where Geoff can throw 80
[43:42.170 --> 43:44.330]  and he's like the pinch hitter of this baseball team.
[43:44.470 --> 43:46.130]  He comes into the West and he closes
[43:46.130 --> 43:48.430]  it out. I wanna see baseball,
[43:48.570 --> 43:50.210]  Geoff. If you can throw 80,
[43:50.330 --> 43:52.330]  Geoff, Eric has to let
[43:52.330 --> 43:54.370]  you throw it at his bruise. No way,
[43:54.530 --> 43:56.310]  dude. I wouldn't hurt him like that. Eric,
[43:56.310 --> 43:58.330]  how fast is that ball traveling, do you think, that hit
[43:58.330 --> 43:59.930]  you in the lap? Oh,
[44:00.530 --> 44:02.070]  man. It was going, I mean,
[44:02.170 --> 44:04.190]  it was a line drive. I was
[44:04.190 --> 44:06.030]  probably 40 feet from the plate
[44:06.370 --> 44:07.670]  and it hit me in the thigh.
[44:08.490 --> 44:09.530]  So, oh, god.
[44:10.430 --> 44:11.750]  I mean, fast?
[44:12.270 --> 44:13.510]  I also don't think
[44:14.710 --> 44:16.330]  Geoff could... I don't think you could throw
[44:16.330 --> 44:18.350]  80 accurately either.
[44:18.630 --> 44:20.350]  I didn't say I could throw it accurately at all.
[44:20.470 --> 44:21.990]  Well, I just don't think you can throw 80, period.
[44:22.410 --> 44:24.310]  Hold on, I'll be right back. I gotta let my dog out.
[44:24.310 --> 44:26.190]  It's crying. What is, like, our
[44:26.190 --> 44:28.190]  dream, Gavin? Because we want...
[44:28.190 --> 44:30.370]  I want it to be close enough that Geoff
[44:30.370 --> 44:31.490]  believes he can do it
[44:31.490 --> 44:34.250]  so he does the training. I think if he
[44:34.250 --> 44:36.410]  throws below 40
[44:36.410 --> 44:38.470]  he's not gonna bother. Oh, there's no way
[44:38.470 --> 44:40.130]  he's gonna bother if it's below 40.
[44:40.190 --> 44:42.190]  I wonder what that number is, though. Maybe if he
[44:42.190 --> 44:44.430]  throws, like, 60, 65, it's achievable.
[44:44.970 --> 44:45.830]  Here's the thing.
[44:46.030 --> 44:46.630]  Here's the thing.
[44:47.890 --> 44:50.410]  When we go to Mega64,
[44:50.690 --> 44:52.210]  we would go to fairs and we'd go to
[44:52.210 --> 44:54.150]  baseball games, and Sean, who's
[44:54.150 --> 44:56.030]  the most athletic of all those guys,
[44:56.650 --> 44:57.610]  big baseball fan,
[44:58.130 --> 45:00.250]  he would throw, and the hardest he would
[45:00.250 --> 45:02.150]  throw is 69, and his
[45:02.150 --> 45:04.350]  record ever is 72.
[45:04.850 --> 45:06.230]  So when Geoff is telling
[45:06.230 --> 45:08.170]  me that he's going to throw 80, I'll
[45:08.170 --> 45:10.170]  put $100 on it that you won't break 75.
[45:10.970 --> 45:11.930]  There's no way.
[45:12.410 --> 45:14.450]  We'll see. I wanna see
[45:14.450 --> 45:15.650]  his pitching form, too.
[45:15.950 --> 45:18.130]  Like, is he gonna sprint full speed and
[45:18.130 --> 45:19.990]  throw the ball? Like, what is his move?
[45:19.990 --> 45:21.810]  You think he's gonna
[45:21.810 --> 45:23.070]  happy Gilmore it?
[45:25.590 --> 45:27.410]  I'm gonna pitch like a
[45:27.840 --> 45:29.090]  Major League Baseball player.
[45:29.390 --> 45:35.970]  So what number, Geoff, does it have to
[45:35.970 --> 45:37.870]  be for you to decide that you think you
[45:37.870 --> 45:40.050]  can do it and train on that first throw?
[45:40.130 --> 45:42.070]  Oh, I think I can do it regardless.
[45:42.330 --> 45:43.530]  It's just about how much training
[45:43.530 --> 45:45.290]  and what the time frame is.
[45:45.450 --> 45:47.610]  Oh, so it's how long of prep you require.
[45:47.610 --> 45:49.410]  Yeah, I'll get to 80 regardless.
[45:49.650 --> 45:51.630]  It's just, is it gonna take me a month or is it gonna take me
[45:51.630 --> 45:52.410]  six months? I don't know.
[45:53.630 --> 45:55.530]  Okay. I think we should give him three
[45:55.530 --> 45:57.590]  months, and if he's not at 80 by three
[45:57.590 --> 45:59.610]  months, then he can't do it. Yeah, but
[45:59.610 --> 46:01.810]  that three months starts after I throw the first pitch.
[46:02.090 --> 46:03.210]  Yeah. Of course.
[46:03.670 --> 46:05.570]  The first test. I was gonna say
[46:05.570 --> 46:07.750]  I feel like we need to make some rules on steroid usage
[46:07.750 --> 46:09.590]  and then I've come to the conclusion I don't think it
[46:09.590 --> 46:11.010]  matters. You do whatever you want.
[46:11.150 --> 46:13.550]  I don't think it will impact us in any way. God, if I could
[46:13.550 --> 46:15.530]  get some steroids for my shoulder, I would
[46:15.530 --> 46:17.050]  do it in a second. Not like
[46:17.570 --> 46:19.510]  Jose Canseco, Tiny Nuts, juicing
[46:19.510 --> 46:21.730]  in a fucking stall
[46:21.730 --> 46:23.170]  steroids, but if I could get some
[46:23.170 --> 46:25.510]  from a doctor, that'd be fucking great.
[46:26.030 --> 46:27.690]  Tiny Nut Canseco is a great
[46:27.690 --> 46:29.850]  nickname. Well, that's what happened to him, right?
[46:30.630 --> 46:31.350]  Oh, man.
[46:31.530 --> 46:33.210]  Is that a known fact? Is that on the record?
[46:33.290 --> 46:35.230]  Steroids make you nuts small. Yeah.
[46:35.950 --> 46:37.230]  Where does all the nut
[46:37.230 --> 46:38.150]  flesh go?
[46:39.230 --> 46:40.710]  I don't know. It sucks up in you, I guess.
[46:42.650 --> 46:43.550]  Wait, is that a
[46:43.550 --> 46:45.270]  negative? I guess less
[46:45.270 --> 46:47.510]  testosterone, right, would be the consequence
[46:47.510 --> 46:49.350]  of it? Yeah, I feel like... Ask
[46:50.070 --> 46:51.670]  Jose Canseco's wife. I don't know.
[46:52.630 --> 46:53.990]  I feel like...
[46:53.990 --> 46:54.990]  More skin, less
[46:58.170 --> 46:59.310]  Cosmetically, less nut
[46:59.310 --> 47:00.790]  doesn't seem like a bad idea.
[47:01.370 --> 47:03.470]  It's not something I'm necessarily opposed to.
[47:03.590 --> 47:04.930]  Andrew, are your nuts too big?
[47:05.470 --> 47:07.630]  I don't know what the scale
[47:07.630 --> 47:09.590]  is. You're worried
[47:09.590 --> 47:10.870]  about your nut size, aren't you?
[47:10.870 --> 47:12.770]  No, I'm not. I'm very... Listen,
[47:12.890 --> 47:14.870]  I'm not self-conscious about my nut size at all.
[47:14.950 --> 47:17.030]  I'm just saying, I don't think that if they were smaller,
[47:17.210 --> 47:18.930]  it would be a bad thing. Have you guys
[47:18.930 --> 47:20.910]  ever measured... You know those little, like...
[47:22.070 --> 47:22.950]  Those little, like,
[47:23.030 --> 47:24.850]  precise measuring... Yeah,
[47:24.970 --> 47:26.350]  like, have you guys ever measured your nuts?
[47:26.970 --> 47:28.850]  What, do you just go around the dot, like,
[47:29.250 --> 47:30.630]  the circumference of the tape measure? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:31.250 --> 47:32.830]  Not a tape measure, but, like, one of those
[47:32.830 --> 47:34.530]  little, like... You know what I'm talking about? Those little, like,
[47:35.270 --> 47:36.810]  shiny metal tools
[47:36.810 --> 47:38.830]  that they use to precisely measure
[47:38.830 --> 47:40.650]  like, car parts and shit, right? Yeah.
[47:40.730 --> 47:42.830]  You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, I know what you mean, but in my head, it's
[47:42.830 --> 47:44.870]  way funnier if it's, like, one of those things you measure
[47:44.870 --> 47:47.170]  your foot size in. That's fine, too.
[47:47.410 --> 47:48.850]  That's fine, too. Yeah, as long as you don't
[47:48.850 --> 47:51.130]  smash yourself. Seems dangerous.
[47:52.050 --> 47:52.770]  Alright, so we're
[47:52.770 --> 47:54.870]  45 minutes in now, and we still haven't...
[47:57.770 --> 47:58.410]  Oh, God.
[47:58.790 --> 48:00.830]  What was Vegas like? It was awesome, dude.
[48:00.950 --> 48:02.650]  I went... I was... So, I went to Vegas
[48:02.650 --> 48:04.850]  for Andrew to buy him some video
[48:04.850 --> 48:06.610]  games, and I was hoping
[48:06.610 --> 48:08.470]  that it would turn into a whole funny
[48:08.470 --> 48:10.550]  adventure that would be great content for
[48:10.550 --> 48:12.850]  this podcast. What actually happens,
[48:13.230 --> 48:14.010]  or happened is,
[48:14.330 --> 48:16.470]  I took an Uber to a used video
[48:16.470 --> 48:18.330]  game store that was lovely,
[48:18.530 --> 48:20.490]  and the people that worked there were very
[48:20.490 --> 48:22.730]  nice, and... So it wasn't in a rough area?
[48:22.870 --> 48:24.010]  They were familiar with
[48:24.550 --> 48:26.370]  roosterteeth and stuff. It was in a lovely
[48:26.370 --> 48:27.790]  area, nice strip mall,
[48:28.150 --> 48:30.450]  really nice store, huge, tons
[48:30.450 --> 48:32.370]  of stuff, and I bought him a copy
[48:32.370 --> 48:34.330]  of Fallout New Vegas and a copy
[48:34.330 --> 48:36.350]  of Saints Row 2, factory
[48:36.350 --> 48:38.430]  sealed, and got a
[48:38.430 --> 48:40.410]  decent price on them. And so
[48:40.410 --> 48:42.330]  I... They're in my closet. I'll have to figure out
[48:42.330 --> 48:44.370]  how to get them to you. I guess I'll mail them to
[48:44.370 --> 48:46.050]  you at some point. Good luck
[48:46.050 --> 48:47.810]  on that. And...
[48:48.290 --> 48:50.450]  But you... Andrew, you technically own
[48:50.450 --> 48:51.990]  them. They're just in my house in Texas.
[48:52.590 --> 48:54.270]  That's very exciting. Thank you so much. Yeah, it was super easy.
[48:54.390 --> 48:56.290]  I was happy... I was looking... So we were
[48:56.290 --> 48:58.470]  gonna go... Emily and I were looking for a weekend away.
[48:58.750 --> 49:00.290]  We were thinking Chicago to
[49:00.290 --> 49:02.270]  see a White Sox game or LA to see a Dodgers game,
[49:02.270 --> 49:04.070]  but we decided to hold off and wait
[49:04.070 --> 49:06.210]  till the playoffs and then just go to Vegas
[49:06.210 --> 49:08.370]  and it was an excuse to go to Vegas
[49:09.390 --> 49:10.470]  and bet on sports.
[49:10.650 --> 49:12.210]  But also, it was fun
[49:12.210 --> 49:14.270]  and I was happy to do it and I got to explore
[49:14.270 --> 49:16.190]  Vegas a little bit. And I did
[49:16.190 --> 49:18.430]  something in Vegas that I have yet to do.
[49:18.790 --> 49:20.210]  I've embarrassed myself in a way
[49:20.210 --> 49:22.230]  that I have yet to embarrass myself. I'm so
[49:22.230 --> 49:23.550]  excited. What did you do?
[49:24.810 --> 49:26.210]  Well... Let me preface this
[49:26.210 --> 49:27.450]  by saying...
[49:27.990 --> 49:30.010]  If you're training, it would be completely different.
[49:30.010 --> 49:31.470]  No, just to get it out there, because
[49:31.990 --> 49:33.710]  you know my life is
[49:34.650 --> 49:35.890]  just imbued with
[49:35.890 --> 49:37.730]  feces, right? Oh no.
[49:38.510 --> 49:40.110]  I will say, just to get
[49:40.110 --> 49:41.990]  it out of the way, yesterday I barefoot stepped on
[49:41.990 --> 49:44.230]  dog shit again, squeezed between
[49:44.230 --> 49:46.030]  my big toe and my other toe. I got to look
[49:46.030 --> 49:48.070]  down and see poop squeezing between my toes
[49:48.070 --> 49:50.250]  and on Monday morning
[49:50.250 --> 49:52.030]  I woke up and arrowhead shit
[49:52.030 --> 49:54.010]  the crate. So I got to do that again too.
[49:54.370 --> 49:56.010]  First time she's done it in a while. Why didn't you
[49:56.010 --> 49:56.670]  look down?
[49:57.910 --> 49:58.230]  Dude,
[49:58.950 --> 50:00.550]  yeah, great question, right? He's like in an
[50:00.550 --> 50:02.310]  FPS game. What?
[50:02.490 --> 50:04.430]  Can't see his feet. Yeah, I was like golden eye.
[50:04.690 --> 50:05.750]  What I did
[50:06.590 --> 50:08.790]  in Vegas that was a new embarrassment is
[50:08.790 --> 50:10.690]  had this, you know, staying at this nice hotel
[50:10.690 --> 50:12.390]  we always stay at, big bathroom.
[50:12.790 --> 50:14.650]  I turned the shower on, took off
[50:14.650 --> 50:16.530]  my clothes and I was going to jump
[50:16.530 --> 50:18.570]  into the shower and I thought, oh, I got to
[50:18.570 --> 50:20.550]  pee and I froze and I thought, oh, I should run to the bathroom
[50:20.550 --> 50:22.470]  to pee and then I thought, I'll just pee in the shower.
[50:22.610 --> 50:24.430]  That's, you know, that's fine, whatever.
[50:24.950 --> 50:25.790]  It's not my shower.
[50:26.010 --> 50:28.290]  And so I jumped into the shower
[50:28.290 --> 50:30.630]  to pee and you know how like when you start
[50:30.630 --> 50:32.370]  peeing it makes you sometimes fart
[50:32.370 --> 50:34.450]  or poop and you can't stop it? Oh no,
[50:34.730 --> 50:36.410]  Geoff, no! I had to
[50:36.410 --> 50:38.350]  fart and so I was
[50:38.350 --> 50:39.990]  peeing and I thought, oh, I just got to
[50:40.490 --> 50:42.410]  fart and then I went, oh
[50:42.410 --> 50:44.670]  God! That's not a fart!
[50:45.030 --> 50:46.570]  And I turned and I
[50:46.570 --> 50:48.410]  ran from the shower to the
[50:48.410 --> 50:50.190]  toilet and I
[50:50.770 --> 50:52.550]  shit all the way to the
[50:52.550 --> 50:53.870]  toilet. A trail!
[50:54.170 --> 50:55.550]  A trail of little
[50:57.090 --> 50:58.630]  bloopy turds from the
[50:58.630 --> 51:00.450]  shower all the way to the toilet.
[51:00.590 --> 51:02.290]  Like a little
[51:02.290 --> 51:04.730]  like a snail
[51:04.730 --> 51:06.450]  trail of diarrhea
[51:06.450 --> 51:08.610]  duty. Because also, I don't know what happened
[51:08.610 --> 51:10.510]  to me in Vegas, but the second I
[51:10.510 --> 51:12.750]  got to Vegas, the diarrhea turned on
[51:12.750 --> 51:14.590]  and it did not turn off until I got back to the
[51:14.590 --> 51:16.670]  toilet. It was like a British guy
[51:16.670 --> 51:18.250]  visiting America after a while.
[51:18.690 --> 51:20.210]  I was straight to the toilet.
[51:21.970 --> 51:22.430]  And you
[51:22.430 --> 51:24.530]  couldn't stop it? No, dude.
[51:24.590 --> 51:26.390]  You couldn't just hold most of it in until two seconds?
[51:26.390 --> 51:28.410]  And I'll be honest with you, I didn't know.
[51:28.570 --> 51:30.290]  Like, I felt it and I went like, oh,
[51:30.350 --> 51:32.210]  that felt bad. So I
[51:32.210 --> 51:34.210]  turned around to run and then I ran
[51:34.210 --> 51:36.130]  to the toilet and I sat down on the toilet
[51:36.130 --> 51:38.270]  and then I looked up and I saw like,
[51:38.390 --> 51:40.370]  what is that on the floor? Oh, no!
[51:40.810 --> 51:41.730]  And then I looked around the
[51:42.130 --> 51:43.770]  door and I saw that I had left a trail.
[51:44.410 --> 51:46.090]  Yeah. Yeah.
[51:46.710 --> 51:47.050]  Yeah.
[51:48.990 --> 51:49.350]  So...
[51:49.350 --> 51:50.230]  Did you tell Emily?
[51:50.950 --> 51:53.210]  Oh yeah, immediately. I was like, oh my god
[51:53.210 --> 51:54.790]  you're not going to believe it, I just shit everywhere.
[51:55.570 --> 51:56.490]  Yeah, she was
[51:57.490 --> 51:59.110]  horrified. I like
[51:59.110 --> 52:01.210]  the not going to believe it. That's the most
[52:01.210 --> 52:02.750]  believable thing I've ever heard.
[52:02.990 --> 52:04.370]  I absolutely believe it.
[52:04.590 --> 52:07.110]  This isn't at all surprising. That's fair.
[52:07.370 --> 52:08.990]  Yeah. And so I don't
[52:08.990 --> 52:11.090]  even know what to think about that one, man, because like
[52:12.470 --> 52:13.070]  now I got
[52:13.070 --> 52:14.890]  to worry about shitting in the shower.
[52:14.890 --> 52:16.610]  Well, I mean, if it's diarrhea,
[52:17.050 --> 52:18.250]  it's... I don't...
[52:18.250 --> 52:20.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it was diarrhea.
[52:20.510 --> 52:22.850]  It wasn't normal. It was diarrhea.
[52:23.530 --> 52:24.950]  I don't understand why you're applying
[52:24.950 --> 52:26.890]  locations to this. It's farting
[52:26.890 --> 52:28.830]  is the issue. Wherever you
[52:28.830 --> 52:30.830]  fart will be a problem. It's not suddenly
[52:30.830 --> 52:32.830]  a shower issue. A piss fart is
[52:32.830 --> 52:34.690]  different. Yeah, piss farts different.
[52:35.170 --> 52:36.990]  I don't think piss... I don't think I've
[52:36.990 --> 52:38.470]  experienced this. And honestly,
[52:38.670 --> 52:40.690]  if I had just taken a right
[52:40.690 --> 52:42.730]  instead of a left and gone to the toilet,
[52:42.730 --> 52:44.950]  like a civilized
[52:44.950 --> 52:47.010]  human, I would have just...
[52:47.010 --> 52:48.730]  I would have fart-doodied into
[52:48.730 --> 52:50.110]  the toilet, and it wouldn't have been a problem.
[52:52.530 --> 52:52.890]  Wait...
[52:54.110 --> 52:54.850]  Wait, so you
[52:54.850 --> 52:56.890]  ran like an out route? Like, what do you mean?
[52:56.950 --> 52:58.970]  Like, you didn't run the best path to the toilet?
[52:59.070 --> 53:00.690]  Or do you mean before you... Well, no, you went to the
[53:00.690 --> 53:02.830]  shower instead of the toilet. Oh, okay. Like, when I realized
[53:02.830 --> 53:04.570]  I had to pee and I had just gotten naked,
[53:04.650 --> 53:06.770]  I thought left into the shower or right
[53:06.770 --> 53:09.050]  to the toilet. I went right... Got it. It's a good thing
[53:09.050 --> 53:10.490]  you sit down and pee.
[53:10.490 --> 53:12.210]  It is a good thing I sit down and pee.
[53:12.310 --> 53:13.450]  And here's why, right?
[53:14.770 --> 53:16.270]  It's as if I needed more
[53:16.270 --> 53:17.870]  encouragement to sit and pee.
[53:18.210 --> 53:20.290]  Maybe that's why, in a way, because
[53:20.290 --> 53:22.650]  you've, like, Pavlov'd yourself
[53:22.650 --> 53:25.130]  into thinking it's safe
[53:25.130 --> 53:26.490]  to fart and shit while
[53:26.490 --> 53:28.830]  peeing. So in the shower... I've probably...
[53:28.830 --> 53:30.570]  I've trained my anus.
[53:31.290 --> 53:32.490]  God dammit, you're right.
[53:32.770 --> 53:34.410]  How do you untrain an anus?
[53:34.870 --> 53:36.470]  Or how do you retrain an anus?
[53:38.390 --> 53:39.770]  How fast of a ball
[53:39.770 --> 53:41.130]  do you think Geoff's anus could throw?
[53:46.310 --> 53:47.330]  Oh, man.
[53:47.630 --> 53:49.350]  Uh, Andrew, your homework.
[53:49.690 --> 53:51.450]  So, I'm pretty sure
[53:51.450 --> 53:53.430]  I have Gavin convinced on this. So we were
[53:53.430 --> 53:55.550]  talking about, like, Eric
[53:55.550 --> 53:57.410]  said no, under
[53:57.410 --> 53:59.370]  no circumstances are we allowed to
[53:59.370 --> 54:00.630]  jet ski joust.
[54:01.110 --> 54:03.350]  And then he seemed to...
[54:03.350 --> 54:05.310]  He seemed like
[54:05.310 --> 54:07.330]  he was down on the idea of us
[54:07.330 --> 54:09.250]  high-fiving in jet skis, right?
[54:09.570 --> 54:11.010]  So I had another idea.
[54:11.450 --> 54:13.590]  That'd make it maybe a little less dangerous.
[54:13.810 --> 54:15.190]  I also had another idea about this.
[54:15.350 --> 54:17.350]  But you continue. So what if we
[54:17.350 --> 54:19.150]  get... We still get the sprunk ramp, right?
[54:19.330 --> 54:21.290]  And we put it in the water, but we put it in the water kind of
[54:21.290 --> 54:23.310]  near the edge. We get another ramp on the
[54:23.310 --> 54:25.390]  edge. Then one of us is on, like
[54:25.390 --> 54:27.250]  Gavin or I... Let's say Gavin's on the jet
[54:27.250 --> 54:29.330]  ski. I'm on a bicycle, right?
[54:29.610 --> 54:31.510]  And then... So Gavin's going...
[54:31.510 --> 54:33.210]  Like, Gavin's following the coast
[54:33.210 --> 54:35.310]  and I'm coming at him at a 90-degree
[54:35.310 --> 54:37.230]  angle, right? And then so I... We
[54:37.230 --> 54:39.170]  both hit ramps at the same time. And then
[54:39.170 --> 54:41.250]  I pass in front of him on
[54:41.250 --> 54:43.110]  the jet ski and on my bicycle.
[54:43.330 --> 54:44.910]  We high-five in the air.
[54:45.110 --> 54:47.090]  Then I just fall in the water with the bicycle. We
[54:47.090 --> 54:48.770]  pull it out, and then he sails off on the jet ski.
[54:49.110 --> 54:50.910]  I feel like this is way more dangerous.
[54:51.170 --> 54:53.230]  What do you mean? What? That's what Gavin
[54:53.230 --> 54:55.010]  said. However, as I
[54:55.010 --> 54:57.090]  pointed out to Gavin, as I pointed
[54:57.090 --> 54:59.070]  out to Gavin, who said, this seems like a lot.
[54:59.130 --> 55:01.210]  It seems dangerous. Gavin was scared to death
[55:01.210 --> 55:03.150]  when he got on the jet ski. The Gavin
[55:03.150 --> 55:05.090]  that got off the jet ski was a totally
[55:05.090 --> 55:07.390]  different man. I'm scared. I'm
[55:07.390 --> 55:09.330]  scared to do this, too. But once we break
[55:09.330 --> 55:11.110]  the trick down into segments and we
[55:11.110 --> 55:13.110]  practice those segments and we get comfortable with those
[55:13.110 --> 55:15.150]  segments and we realize they're not as scary
[55:15.150 --> 55:16.650]  and it was taken individually,
[55:16.870 --> 55:19.330]  then we put the whole thing together. Boom.
[55:19.430 --> 55:21.250]  We're set up for success. I just don't
[55:21.250 --> 55:23.090]  think that's how it works. Like, the man that got on the
[55:23.090 --> 55:25.170]  jet ski was obviously... I got
[55:25.170 --> 55:26.810]  off way more confident than I got on.
[55:27.030 --> 55:29.330]  But I also got off in way more danger.
[55:29.330 --> 55:31.210]  Because with confidence comes
[55:32.150 --> 55:33.270]  stupidity and danger.
[55:33.790 --> 55:35.390]  Oh, absolutely. I told you. I felt
[55:35.390 --> 55:37.350]  the gravitational... I felt the
[55:37.350 --> 55:39.250]  gravitational pull towards an accident. I
[55:39.250 --> 55:40.990]  still do. That's gonna happen.
[55:42.190 --> 55:43.490]  Is it gonna happen here?
[55:43.670 --> 55:45.290]  I don't think so. I think it'll come
[55:45.290 --> 55:47.310]  in an unexpected way. I think when we do
[55:47.310 --> 55:48.750]  the dumb shit, it all...
[55:48.750 --> 55:51.770]  it gracefully...
[55:52.530 --> 55:53.290]  typically goes
[55:53.290 --> 55:53.750]  without a hitch.
[55:56.190 --> 55:57.250]  But we're gonna
[55:57.250 --> 55:59.030]  take it in parts.
[55:59.110 --> 56:01.310]  It's like, I'm not gonna throw an 80 mile
[56:01.310 --> 56:03.270]  an hour ball tomorrow. I'm gonna throw it in
[56:03.270 --> 56:05.210]  a month or two. You don't know that.
[56:05.550 --> 56:06.410]  It takes time.
[56:07.130 --> 56:08.050]  Maybe I will.
[56:08.230 --> 56:10.350]  Maybe I will.
[56:10.810 --> 56:12.830]  If I can throw an 80 mile an hour ball
[56:12.830 --> 56:15.010]  in a month, I can probably throw a 90 mile an hour ball
[56:15.010 --> 56:17.110]  in six months. Who knows? Okay, so I'm going along
[56:17.110 --> 56:19.290]  the coast. You're coming
[56:19.290 --> 56:20.470]  in from the coast.
[56:21.250 --> 56:23.090]  90 degrees. Yeah, I'm just like...
[56:23.090 --> 56:25.110]  I'm coming at you, right? And am I
[56:25.110 --> 56:27.170]  just holding up my arm? So you're just
[56:27.170 --> 56:29.050]  gonna hit the ramp, going like, I don't know, not
[56:29.050 --> 56:30.730]  too fast, a few miles an hour or whatever.
[56:31.550 --> 56:33.170]  So you hit the ramp, you go
[56:33.170 --> 56:34.610]  up, and as I see you're coming,
[56:35.070 --> 56:37.030]  I hit my ramp ahead of you so
[56:37.030 --> 56:38.710]  that I pass in front of you
[56:38.710 --> 56:41.110]  and then I kind of reach my right arm
[56:41.110 --> 56:42.990]  back as I go, and then as you're
[56:42.990 --> 56:45.050]  coming in, you reach your arm out
[56:45.050 --> 56:46.790]  and then we just tap
[56:46.790 --> 56:48.150]  each other's hands and then I
[56:48.850 --> 56:51.170]  fall into the water and I have to drag a bike out. I have the hard
[56:51.170 --> 56:53.070]  job. You just sail off. But what happens
[56:53.070 --> 56:55.190]  when you're mid-air, you're reaching
[56:55.830 --> 56:57.090]  back and suddenly
[56:57.090 --> 56:58.930]  your front tire is heading
[56:58.930 --> 57:00.870]  for my forehead? Like, what do we do there?
[57:01.450 --> 57:02.470]  So you move.
[57:03.410 --> 57:04.410]  Oh, you move. You move your forehead.
[57:04.890 --> 57:07.210]  That's a great point. That's a great point. You just move,
[57:07.310 --> 57:08.930]  Gavin. Also, we'll practice so that
[57:08.930 --> 57:10.970]  we'll practice so that that part doesn't happen.
[57:11.030 --> 57:12.450]  Well, I'm on the jet ski in the sky.
[57:12.450 --> 57:15.150]  There's no practicing this. You do this
[57:15.150 --> 57:17.350]  once. There's no practicing this.
[57:17.530 --> 57:19.010]  We're gonna... Listen, we'll
[57:19.010 --> 57:20.930]  practice. It's gonna be fun. I did the
[57:20.930 --> 57:23.190]  stupid bike trick a thousand
[57:23.190 --> 57:24.590]  times for Gavin.
[57:25.170 --> 57:27.310]  We're gonna have to do this
[57:27.310 --> 57:29.330]  a few times before we get the right shot.
[57:30.050 --> 57:31.330]  Those are comparable.
[57:31.650 --> 57:33.190]  Those are very different levels of...
[57:33.190 --> 57:34.230]  Stunts are stunts.
[57:34.710 --> 57:37.070]  I don't think we can even do what you're describing
[57:37.070 --> 57:37.630]  in GTA.
[57:40.050 --> 57:41.290]  I think we can
[57:41.290 --> 57:42.930]  and maybe that's some supplementary
[57:43.510 --> 57:45.310]  content for the site. We'll put that on
[57:45.310 --> 57:47.390]  YouTube. We'll plan it out in GTA
[57:47.390 --> 57:49.470]  and if we can do it in GTA
[57:49.470 --> 57:50.770]  then we'll try it in the real world.
[57:51.250 --> 57:52.770]  Let's do a GTA video.
[57:53.070 --> 57:55.490]  If we can't do it within an hour, we don't bother
[57:55.490 --> 57:56.150]  in real life.
[57:57.010 --> 57:59.210]  I think we can work up to this and more.
[58:00.030 --> 58:00.930]  So what's my homework?
[58:01.370 --> 58:03.150]  I feel like I missed...
[58:03.150 --> 58:05.230]  You're right. Gavin and I were talking about
[58:05.230 --> 58:07.290]  how to better incorporate you into the jet ski
[58:07.290 --> 58:09.370]  stuff since you're in Canada and how
[58:09.370 --> 58:11.170]  do we really leverage Andrew's
[58:11.170 --> 58:13.370]  greatest strengths, right? And I think
[58:13.370 --> 58:15.170]  you're like ultimate
[58:15.830 --> 58:16.290]  superpower.
[58:17.050 --> 58:18.010]  You're like
[58:18.010 --> 58:20.030]  Superman X-Ray Vision, right?
[58:20.110 --> 58:20.830]  Or Heat Ray Vision.
[58:21.290 --> 58:23.770]  Is getting free shit from corporations.
[58:24.090 --> 58:25.810]  So all we need you to do is
[58:25.810 --> 58:28.530]  reach out to Seedoo or Yamaha
[58:28.530 --> 58:30.270]  or any other, but ideally
[58:30.270 --> 58:31.910]  Seedoo via social media
[58:31.910 --> 58:34.270]  and get them to donate or give us
[58:34.270 --> 58:36.270]  or sponsor F*** Face
[58:36.270 --> 58:38.230]  with an official
[58:38.230 --> 58:40.090]  F*** Face jet ski that
[58:40.090 --> 58:41.350]  they can provide for us.
[58:41.830 --> 58:44.130]  It'd be great if it had the logo on it, but it doesn't have to.
[58:44.130 --> 58:46.250]  Supreme sold a jet ski, we can.
[58:46.670 --> 58:48.330]  I'm going to transcribe how you
[58:48.830 --> 58:50.190]  describe the stunt you
[58:50.190 --> 58:52.250]  want to do word for word. Just email
[58:52.250 --> 58:54.330]  that to every Seedoo company
[58:54.330 --> 58:55.150]  I could find.
[58:55.530 --> 58:56.710]  See if we have any takers.
[58:57.650 --> 58:58.910]  That's not going to get us anywhere.
[58:59.550 --> 59:02.250]  We need you to do your Andrew best.
[59:02.670 --> 59:04.010]  Can I propose
[59:04.010 --> 59:06.130]  my kind of cross idea I had
[59:06.130 --> 59:07.890]  about this? I was thinking about this stunt too.
[59:08.170 --> 59:10.110]  It doesn't involve the ramp. I forgot about
[59:10.110 --> 59:12.290]  the whole ramp thing. Already I like this better.
[59:14.110 --> 59:14.510]  Combining
[59:14.510 --> 59:16.510]  of ideas. I talked about
[59:16.510 --> 59:17.870]  doing the jet ski
[59:17.870 --> 59:18.570]  jousting.
[59:19.830 --> 59:22.110]  Did you see the image somebody made?
[59:22.510 --> 59:24.410]  Yeah! By the way, I still think
[59:24.410 --> 59:26.170]  it's a good idea. Did you see it Gavin?
[59:26.330 --> 59:28.070]  Yeah, you guys could do it. No, I didn't see it.
[59:28.330 --> 59:30.370]  Here, I'll post it right now. It was made by
[59:30.370 --> 59:32.230]  I believe someone named Moo York on the
[59:32.230 --> 59:34.230]  subreddit. Look at it. You can't tell me this doesn't
[59:34.230 --> 59:36.330]  look f***ing cool. You wouldn't watch that.
[59:36.350 --> 59:38.170]  It looks great, but the frame of that is
[59:38.170 --> 59:40.230]  both of us with a pole through our
[59:40.230 --> 59:41.910]  hearts. What are you talking about?
[59:41.950 --> 59:44.450]  We'll put a tennis ball on the end of the pole or something.
[59:47.130 --> 59:48.250]  So this is my idea.
[59:48.450 --> 59:49.730]  Kind of a cross between the two.
[59:50.130 --> 59:52.310]  We get the jousting sticks, right?
[59:52.650 --> 59:54.170]  You guys both jet skis.
[59:55.030 --> 59:55.790]  No, no, no, no, no.
[59:56.170 --> 59:58.150]  Trust me, mine is so much safer.
[59:58.550 --> 01:00:00.470]  We get giant foam hands
[01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:01.910]  and we duct tape them
[01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:04.350]  to the ends of the jousting sticks.
[01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:06.210]  You guys high five with the foam hands
[01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:07.990]  going past each other. Why do you...
[01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:09.790]  I love that idea.
[01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:11.950]  The stick is going through
[01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:13.970]  someone. No, no, no, no. You're not aiming
[01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:16.090]  at each other. You're aiming at a middle point
[01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:18.050]  between the two and they're gonna cross and
[01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:19.690]  hit each other. So they're slapping in the middle.
[01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:21.490]  It's like a distance high five.
[01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:23.470]  It is a distance high five
[01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:25.950]  combining the jousting idea. I think
[01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:27.930]  this is the safest thing approached. I think this is
[01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:29.470]  viable. I think this could be done.
[01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:31.950]  I think that's great. What we're gonna need, though, is the
[01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:34.130]  see-dos. So we need you to work on that.
[01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:36.950]  And here's the thing.
[01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:38.910]  We're gonna do, once we have
[01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:41.230]  the jet skis,
[01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:43.070]  yeah, but we need our own jet skis. I can't keep
[01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:45.130]  renting them. Once you've secured
[01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:47.390]  jet skis
[01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:48.930]  for us, Andrew, via your
[01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:51.110]  Andrew Panton powers, then we
[01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:53.130]  can escalate. We can do all manner
[01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.230]  of tricks.
[01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:56.530]  We're gonna be...
[01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:58.210]  I would like f***face
[01:00:58.950 --> 01:01:01.230]  to be synonymous with the word
[01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:02.350]  or the hyphenate jet ski.
[01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:04.990]  The two go together
[01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:07.690]  like peanut butter and jelly. When you hear
[01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:09.630]  jet ski, immediately
[01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:11.210]  you think, oh, obviously, f***face.
[01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:12.110]  They're the jet ski guys.
[01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:15.310]  There'd be a million different cool tricks
[01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:16.750]  and stunts and stuff we can work on.
[01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:19.250]  So we'd say we're definitely not
[01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:21.490]  a baseball podcast, but 100%
[01:01:21.490 --> 01:01:22.450]  a jet ski podcast.
[01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:24.910]  That's what we are. We're a jet ski podcast.
[01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:26.810]  That's Eric saying we're not a baseball podcast.
[01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:28.450]  I'm just repeating what he said.
[01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.190]  How fast can you throw a jet ski?
[01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:33.810]  I know how fast I can drive one.
[01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:36.470]  I'm just excited. I'm excited for these emails.
[01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:39.570]  Andrew, when do you think you can get going on this?
[01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:41.570]  Do you think you'd have news for us by next week?
[01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:43.390]  Oh, without a doubt.
[01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:45.770]  Could I send them by next week? Will I get a response?
[01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:46.550]  Who knows? We'll see.
[01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:49.230]  Regarding free jet ski?
[01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:51.450]  Ideally two jet skis, but if we could
[01:01:51.450 --> 01:01:52.830]  get one, we'll make it work.
[01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:55.490]  Wait, what do you mean? If we only get one,
[01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:56.770]  you mean you'll rent the other?
[01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:58.310]  Yeah, we'll make it work.
[01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:01.450]  We'll figure it out. I see. I got it.
[01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.310]  I just wanted to make sure you weren't going to
[01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:05.090]  try to reduce the stunt into
[01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:06.950]  both being on the same jet ski somehow
[01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:09.270]  and doing this in some way
[01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:11.550]  as a complicated version of
[01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:13.610]  something that would result in your death.
[01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:14.770]  I think also,
[01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:17.370]  since we're going
[01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:19.430]  all in on jet skis and jet ski
[01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:21.610]  related content here at F*** Face,
[01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:23.110]  which, by the way, if you haven't seen Gavin's
[01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:25.610]  slow-mo jet ski video, it is up on
[01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:27.030]  YouTube and I think on the Instagram.
[01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:28.590]  That's not the stunt, though.
[01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:30.390]  That's not the stunt, that's just...
[01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:32.470]  Not on the same level as the bike stunt,
[01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:34.410]  just so you can get your hopes up.
[01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:36.530]  No, I just
[01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:38.550]  wanted to catch the joy of Gavin's
[01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:40.590]  first jet ski adventure. Well, my girlfriend
[01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.590]  did, I didn't, but yeah. Is there an award
[01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:44.690]  show for, like, stunts? Can we somehow,
[01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:46.510]  like, can we submit a stunt as
[01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:48.530]  stunt of the year? Is there, like, an Oscars for
[01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:50.630]  stunts? Oh, like some sort of stunt festival
[01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:52.350]  we could take it to? Yeah, I feel like
[01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:54.010]  that should be a thing we pursue.
[01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.510]  I don't know if that exists. So, since
[01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:58.450]  we're going all in on jet skis, I think we're gonna have
[01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:00.190]  some jet ski related merchandise, too.
[01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:02.450]  Like, floaty key rings and
[01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:04.550]  those, like, things to hold your glasses
[01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:06.510]  your Oakleys on so you don't lose
[01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:08.250]  them when you fly off the jet ski. You know,
[01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:10.630]  like, like, legit
[01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:12.690]  jet ski related helpful merch.
[01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:14.490]  Can we do a thing, Geoff, where we
[01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.510]  sell toy jet skis and one person just gets
[01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:18.390]  a real jet ski? Yeah!
[01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:19.730]  Why not?
[01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:21.830]  As long as they fit in the same container.
[01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:24.610]  You know how you had that laminated card in your wallet
[01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:26.710]  with all the Roman numerals on? What if we just
[01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:28.650]  had little laminated instructions to
[01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:29.810]  flip a jet ski back over?
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.560]  It's very easy to do.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.480]  You got 60 seconds to do it. Takes you about
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.220]  30 seconds to flip it over.
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.320]  Gravity's gonna do all the work for you.
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.700]  Taurus World Stunt Awards.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.540]  So this is the thing. Oh, they
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:47.540]  got a cool trophy!
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:50.440]  We gotta look into what is the
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.040]  requirements to qualify
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.000]  for submission slash voting.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.160]  This is exciting!
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.120]  Gavin Free, before we
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.980]  end this podcast. I am riding
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:02.040]  my bicycle to your house in a little bit, right? Is that happening?
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.920]  Do you have a bicycle and you're gonna be riding as well?
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.340]  I'm gonna attempt to
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.900]  scramble together enough air to get in this tire.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.020]  I'll let you know if it works.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.740]  I think Trevor and I will be on our way here in a little bit.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.720]  Yeah. I'll get pumping.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.860]  We should alert
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:17.520]  the KXAN and the other...
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.160]  KITV and all the other news channels that they'll be running tonight.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.100]  What?
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:22.760]  Well, Gavin and I are about to hang out.
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.920]  Oh, I see. The rain joke.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.880]  Okay, use the local weather. I got it.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:27.280]  Understood.
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.080]  Local weather's always funny.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.420]  Yeah, it plays well.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.220]  Good episode, I thought.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:35.240]  Yeah, that was fun!
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.780]  Time does just fly by.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.220]  I feel like we didn't really talk about any of the things
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.940]  you need to talk about, but I'm happy with it.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.980]  I think we got through it.
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.160]  October 1st, knobs.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.860]  I shit the floor in Vegas.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.040]  Bought your games.
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.940]  Yeah, no, I think we're good.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:54.900]  The scariest part of that is just not
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.160]  realizing you shat everywhere.
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:58.120]  I didn't know.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.040]  I didn't know until I saw it.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.920]  Yeah, I didn't know the poop hit the floor.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.580]  I thought I, like, clenched, you know?
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:06.860]  But I didn't.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.300]  That's unfortunate.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.880]  But it was like...
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.580]  It was like pudding.
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.640]  I don't need more details.
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.140]  That wasn't anything I could hold in.
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.340]  You know, it was soupy.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.540]  No, it was good.
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.660]  Yeah, we should wrap up.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.580]  Yeah, I guess so.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.680]  I agree.
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.780]  Alright, well, hey, thanks for listening
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.100]  to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.300]  This is the 70th iteration
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.340]  of this show.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.860]  You've been listening to
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:38.460]  pretty far into season 2,
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.080]  year 2.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.260]  Farther into season 2 than we are into year 2.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.220]  Hopefully you like it, and if you do,
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:45.160]  you'll make some stars.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.700]  Oh! Oh! Oh!
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:48.620]  If you have any extra shift keys, Andrew,
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.320]  stars and likes is what we want here
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.300]  at F*** Face on all the
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.760]  Spotify's and the iTunes
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.060]  and SoundCloud's and just
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:59.260]  stars and likes. And tell a friend
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.280]  and then stand over
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.920]  and make sure that friend listens to the podcast
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.660]  and if they don't, slap them in the back of the head and say,
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.440]  pay attention, asshole. You're listening to this podcast and you're gonna laugh.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.220]  And, yeah, I guess that's it.
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:09.720]  We'll see you next week.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.100]  Bye.
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:16.200]  That was good. Bye.
