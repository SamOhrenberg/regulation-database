[00:32.550 --> 00:34.790]  Did you stop? Uh, no, uh...
[00:34.790 --> 00:35.510]  Sort of?
[00:35.530 --> 00:36.790]  I don't know. Why'd you stop?
[00:36.990 --> 00:39.530]  Well, I don't know, you threw Craig in there. I asked, Gavin.
[00:39.610 --> 00:41.670]  We always kind of start early. Who knows?
[00:42.470 --> 00:46.550]  What Andrew and I were talking about definitely before we started, Gavin,
[00:47.450 --> 00:51.390]  is that he asked if I went through Florida in a wheelchair,
[00:51.670 --> 00:53.210]  and I was explaining that I didn't,
[00:53.270 --> 00:59.170]  but that we very carefully planned the week's events from light to heavy.
[01:00.670 --> 01:03.130]  We did the shit that could hurt me on the last day
[01:03.130 --> 01:06.690]  so that Jack could be sure to get as much of his content filmed as necessary.
[01:07.250 --> 01:09.570]  So all the max shakage was at the end.
[01:10.250 --> 01:11.930]  Yeah, max shakage at the end,
[01:12.030 --> 01:14.950]  it culminated with me almost throwing up on the Incredible Hulk ride.
[01:16.570 --> 01:17.590]  That was pretty much it.
[01:18.050 --> 01:20.050]  Are there, like, theme park snobs?
[01:20.430 --> 01:23.290]  You know, like, the same way that there's a wine snob of sorts?
[01:23.370 --> 01:25.650]  Like, is there the equivalent of that for theme parks?
[01:26.050 --> 01:26.790]  I think it's very snobby.
[01:26.790 --> 01:29.690]  Dude, there's all kinds of snobs. You know who I bet they are?
[01:30.010 --> 01:32.190]  You know who I bet the worst are? Apple snobs.
[01:32.730 --> 01:36.030]  Apple snobs? Yeah, oh, fuck you, Apple snobs.
[01:36.290 --> 01:37.090]  Oh, wait, what do you mean?
[01:37.690 --> 01:40.810]  I was very aggressive and I realized that could go separate ways.
[01:40.990 --> 01:43.370]  That is a statement I might actually agree with.
[01:43.430 --> 01:45.310]  They're like, someone's an apple snob up in here.
[01:45.810 --> 01:47.630]  No, no, no, no, no. The context,
[01:47.950 --> 01:51.770]  I thought you were leading into something very specific, a conversation we had.
[01:51.830 --> 01:54.870]  That was a real moment on the podcast right there, audience.
[01:54.870 --> 01:58.890]  Well, I was processing that could mean two things, and one of those I agree with.
[01:59.190 --> 02:02.390]  You just jumped in front of Tim Cook, but no one fired a bullet.
[02:03.810 --> 02:06.690]  No, I would, no, I would not jump in front of Tim Cook.
[02:06.690 --> 02:08.750]  I'm letting that bullet fly in that scenario.
[02:10.110 --> 02:11.550]  Terrible. I don't want anything.
[02:11.750 --> 02:13.790]  Listen, you're the one who fired the shot.
[02:13.810 --> 02:16.630]  I'm just saying I'm not a big Apple guy in that way.
[02:16.670 --> 02:21.450]  I'm a huge fruit Apple guy, not a big Apple computer person,
[02:21.450 --> 02:25.910]  although I use one, but I just there's a snobbery in the Apple products.
[02:26.090 --> 02:28.450]  It's it's a it's a disaster.
[02:28.990 --> 02:30.730]  Can I say I was referring?
[02:31.230 --> 02:33.450]  It was a fruit apple comment, right?
[02:33.510 --> 02:34.910]  It was a fruit apple comment.
[02:34.910 --> 02:37.250]  I forgot that Apple computers exist.
[02:38.150 --> 02:39.730]  Not expecting that response.
[02:40.010 --> 02:42.470]  I'll be honest, I forgot we I forgot we have an Apple thing.
[02:42.570 --> 02:43.750]  I immediately went to the iPhone.
[02:44.110 --> 02:48.150]  Really? See, I thought because we had a whole conversation about this on text,
[02:48.190 --> 02:52.710]  I'd love to hear Eric's opinion on a specific issue we were talking about,
[02:52.850 --> 02:55.770]  because I think it's insane that that you don't don't think about that.
[02:55.890 --> 02:59.070]  But this whole thing is and I have I'm looking at an Apple computer right now.
[02:59.150 --> 03:00.710]  So it clicked in. I didn't know what you meant.
[03:00.770 --> 03:02.530]  I agree. Apple snobbery can be terrible.
[03:02.530 --> 03:04.810]  Apple snobs for the fruit.
[03:05.130 --> 03:07.070]  Completely justified. It's a top fruit.
[03:07.470 --> 03:08.490]  Love an apple.
[03:08.830 --> 03:10.290]  It is an elite fruit.
[03:10.510 --> 03:14.910]  And the comment I'd like to argue, not argue, but bring up to Eric.
[03:15.390 --> 03:19.470]  Geoff said that apples don't have a range of textures.
[03:19.590 --> 03:20.310]  He questioned this.
[03:20.710 --> 03:21.470]  Oh, that's crazy.
[03:21.710 --> 03:23.450]  That's absolutely have a range of textures.
[03:23.590 --> 03:28.610]  Yeah, there's like that's why the word mealy exists to me,
[03:28.610 --> 03:31.250]  because when you eat an apple, that just means bad apple.
[03:31.250 --> 03:34.930]  If it's mealy, I just feel like it's no, that's no, that's a texture types.
[03:35.390 --> 03:37.370]  But that's different texture like that.
[03:37.510 --> 03:40.090]  Look, there's apples that are more mealy than other apples.
[03:40.210 --> 03:42.490]  There's apples that are firmer, some that are softer.
[03:42.810 --> 03:44.670]  There's different apple textures for sure.
[03:44.810 --> 03:48.690]  Listen, when we go to firm or soft, I'm assuming it's how ripe it is.
[03:48.730 --> 03:51.050]  You know, it is specific, different types.
[03:51.270 --> 03:55.350]  I would say like like a Granny Smith is a hard, crispy apple.
[03:55.510 --> 03:58.170]  But like a Braeburn or something, it's got it's a little bit softer.
[03:58.570 --> 04:00.550]  There's not as much resistance when you're going into it.
[04:00.550 --> 04:01.310]  Absolutely.
[04:01.630 --> 04:04.370]  I'll be honest, I don't pay attention to texture on apples.
[04:04.510 --> 04:05.670]  They all feel the same to me.
[04:05.750 --> 04:06.730]  I pay attention to flavor.
[04:07.130 --> 04:07.830]  I will say this.
[04:07.930 --> 04:11.090]  That makes sense to me because you're the biggest banana guy I know.
[04:11.350 --> 04:13.770]  And I think bananas have dog shit texture.
[04:14.010 --> 04:15.350]  And it's my main issue with the banana.
[04:15.570 --> 04:17.370]  I think their texture fucking stinks.
[04:17.850 --> 04:18.190]  I hate it.
[04:18.190 --> 04:19.170]  Can I tell you?
[04:19.530 --> 04:22.850]  Can I tell you something fucking crazy happened to me?
[04:22.930 --> 04:24.990]  I didn't even think this was content, but you just reminded me.
[04:25.250 --> 04:28.150]  Something crazy happened to me in Orlando last week.
[04:28.490 --> 04:29.710]  I was out there for the other podcast.
[04:30.270 --> 04:33.050]  And we were doing the Universal stuff.
[04:33.450 --> 04:37.230]  And the hotel we stayed in doesn't have room service.
[04:37.390 --> 04:41.250]  And my whole plan was not to leave the hotel room so that I could rest my back.
[04:41.370 --> 04:43.270]  You know, just lay down the entire time.
[04:43.450 --> 04:47.470]  Only get up to do my job and then immediately come back.
[04:47.550 --> 04:49.570]  Ignore Jack and Producer Ben.
[04:49.950 --> 04:51.050]  Don't want anything to do with them.
[04:51.330 --> 04:55.670]  And just lay down and rest so that I could be 100% for fuck face, right?
[04:56.090 --> 04:59.050]  And so we stopped the first night at a little convenience store
[04:59.050 --> 05:01.930]  and bought a bunch of groceries so that we could eat in the room.
[05:02.210 --> 05:03.890]  And I bought a bunch of bananas.
[05:04.410 --> 05:05.830]  And I opened one up.
[05:05.890 --> 05:08.470]  And I had a banana the next day.
[05:08.790 --> 05:10.490]  And I almost threw up.
[05:10.610 --> 05:12.390]  I thought I had COVID for a second.
[05:13.070 --> 05:15.090]  Because I have never had...
[05:15.090 --> 05:17.610]  And please, you're gonna think this is a weird thing to say.
[05:17.870 --> 05:20.050]  I've never had a banana taste bad before.
[05:20.430 --> 05:22.070]  I've had bananas go bad.
[05:22.170 --> 05:25.950]  I've had bananas like turn mushy on the backside and be black or whatever.
[05:26.030 --> 05:26.870]  And that's not good.
[05:26.930 --> 05:27.530]  You take a bite of that.
[05:27.570 --> 05:28.590]  You don't realize you're like...
[05:28.590 --> 05:30.450]  Because the banana's turned, right?
[05:30.630 --> 05:35.090]  But I've never had a fresh, ripe banana taste like shit.
[05:35.830 --> 05:37.550]  It was the craziest thing.
[05:37.750 --> 05:38.650]  It tasted like...
[05:38.650 --> 05:41.830]  It had like a sweet taste to it that I almost vomited.
[05:41.950 --> 05:43.450]  It was the grossest thing.
[05:43.730 --> 05:48.050]  And then, because I could smell it, I smelled it in my hotel room the entire time I was there.
[05:48.110 --> 05:50.590]  I was uneasy the entire week I was in Florida.
[05:50.810 --> 05:54.210]  Because I had to take the banana downstairs and throw it in
[05:54.210 --> 05:57.170]  like the little trash can next to the dumpster to get it...
[05:57.170 --> 06:00.210]  next to the elevator to get it further away from me.
[06:00.390 --> 06:01.730]  Did you buy a plantain by accident?
[06:02.190 --> 06:02.730]  No, no.
[06:02.830 --> 06:04.070]  I've had plantains before, dude.
[06:04.150 --> 06:04.730]  This was a banana.
[06:05.450 --> 06:05.910]  It's like a...
[06:05.910 --> 06:07.050]  I was gonna say Chiquita.
[06:07.130 --> 06:07.910]  I don't know what the brand was.
[06:07.950 --> 06:08.710]  But it was definitely...
[06:08.710 --> 06:10.490]  It might have been Dole or Del Monte.
[06:10.690 --> 06:13.030]  See, I feel like bananas have the most...
[06:13.030 --> 06:14.790]  You get good mileage from a banana.
[06:14.970 --> 06:18.790]  Like a banana can physically turn pretty far and like go almost all black.
[06:18.810 --> 06:21.010]  But it's still an edible banana inside.
[06:21.370 --> 06:22.990]  That's the nice thing about a banana, right?
[06:23.270 --> 06:25.050]  There's not a range of flavor like an apple.
[06:25.170 --> 06:26.030]  A banana is a banana.
[06:26.030 --> 06:27.690]  It's always gonna taste like a banana.
[06:27.870 --> 06:30.170]  Which is why at 46 years old,
[06:30.290 --> 06:33.330]  when I put a banana in my mouth that did not taste like a banana,
[06:33.570 --> 06:35.310]  it freaked me the fuck out.
[06:35.670 --> 06:39.190]  You know those like small marshmallow banana candy type things?
[06:39.270 --> 06:42.130]  I'd like to think that they just made full-sized versions of those.
[06:42.230 --> 06:44.350]  And that's what Geoff Haines is baffled by this.
[06:44.650 --> 06:46.350]  Well, isn't that what old bananas were?
[06:46.490 --> 06:49.510]  They were the flavor of like artificial banana now or something?
[06:49.930 --> 06:52.490]  Yes, the original banana flavor is...
[06:52.490 --> 06:53.810]  is gone now, I think, right?
[06:53.810 --> 06:55.950]  Or it tastes like banana candy
[06:55.950 --> 06:59.290]  and then real bananas no longer taste like old bananas used to.
[06:59.350 --> 07:01.090]  I wish I could weigh in and be like,
[07:01.190 --> 07:03.230]  yeah, I kind of agree with these banana opinions.
[07:03.330 --> 07:04.630]  Or like, yeah, that's never happened to me.
[07:04.690 --> 07:06.610]  I fucking hate bananas. I never eat banana.
[07:07.190 --> 07:08.630]  Like I can't. There's no point of reference.
[07:08.630 --> 07:10.410]  What don't you... what do you not like about them?
[07:10.450 --> 07:11.190]  Just the texture?
[07:11.490 --> 07:14.470]  I think the text... like the taste is like a...
[07:14.470 --> 07:16.150]  I don't know, maybe a 5 out of 10?
[07:16.250 --> 07:19.270]  Like the taste is very average to me and the texture is terrible.
[07:19.690 --> 07:20.490]  It's an awful texture.
[07:21.170 --> 07:22.130]  Don't enjoy it at all.
[07:22.130 --> 07:24.350]  I would... we should start ranking fruit,
[07:24.470 --> 07:28.290]  because I would say a banana is an 8 to me.
[07:28.510 --> 07:30.690]  Like it's never a 7, never a 9.
[07:30.790 --> 07:32.770]  It's only ever an 8 because it always tastes the same.
[07:32.970 --> 07:35.630]  But I would give the texture of a banana like a 9 and a half.
[07:35.950 --> 07:36.490]  Are you serious?
[07:36.890 --> 07:39.570]  I like... I like a banana. I like chewing on a banana.
[07:39.950 --> 07:41.290]  Yeah, banana is a top tier fruit.
[07:41.350 --> 07:42.910]  And as we were discussing recently, Andrew,
[07:43.150 --> 07:45.450]  also good because you can drop it and keep eating it.
[07:45.670 --> 07:48.190]  No, there's like... there are definite perks to the banana.
[07:48.290 --> 07:50.850]  You can eat it without actually touching the fruit. That's great.
[07:50.850 --> 07:53.810]  I'm not even going to argue that it's not a good fruit.
[07:53.970 --> 07:56.530]  Like people love the banana. It's a very popular fruit.
[07:56.890 --> 07:59.830]  But I think texture wise, it's a fucking disaster.
[08:00.290 --> 08:01.260]  And it goes lower because...
[08:02.510 --> 08:04.590]  But you like a brownie. You like a cupcake.
[08:05.090 --> 08:08.110]  What the fuck does that mean? They're completely different things.
[08:08.610 --> 08:09.750]  If I... if...
[08:09.750 --> 08:12.130]  Nobody bites into a brownie and is like,
[08:12.190 --> 08:13.370]  oh, this is the same as a banana.
[08:13.570 --> 08:15.030]  It's squishy. It's squishy.
[08:15.190 --> 08:17.730]  There's like a little bit of resistance, a bit more dense in the middle.
[08:17.750 --> 08:19.930]  There's a fucking chalkiness to bananas.
[08:19.930 --> 08:21.790]  And like, it just gets all over the...
[08:21.790 --> 08:22.750]  Like, there's nothing...
[08:23.490 --> 08:23.870]  Chalkiness?
[08:24.150 --> 08:28.890]  The per bite of a banana does not compare to the per bite taste of a brownie
[08:28.890 --> 08:30.110]  or any of the other things you list.
[08:30.150 --> 08:33.030]  I feel like you've had a banana once and it was Geoff's one.
[08:33.290 --> 08:35.330]  It was just like a one-off rancid one.
[08:35.550 --> 08:38.810]  Or you're going off a 14-year-old memory of a banana, dude.
[08:38.990 --> 08:42.530]  If you put a banana in a smoothie, I'm fine with that taste.
[08:42.630 --> 08:44.930]  I think it's a staple of a smoothie drink like that.
[08:45.010 --> 08:46.630]  If we're going to evaluate fruit as a whole,
[08:46.710 --> 08:48.370]  you need to factor in other ways to use it.
[08:48.370 --> 08:50.050]  In a smoothie, you need it.
[08:50.390 --> 08:53.970]  But just if I'm eating it out of a grocery store, grabbing it from the shelf,
[08:54.570 --> 08:56.010]  eating a banana, the texture sucks.
[08:56.230 --> 08:56.790]  It's a terrible texture.
[08:57.010 --> 09:01.530]  If you want to factor in other uses, the banana may be the most useful fruit of all time
[09:01.530 --> 09:05.350]  because anytime you're in a chase and you're trying to run away from a cop
[09:05.350 --> 09:07.410]  or a villain or a mountain lion,
[09:07.650 --> 09:11.350]  you can fucking throw it behind you and you're guaranteed freedom.
[09:12.030 --> 09:16.510]  That's the best thing an apple can do is keep the doctor away for one more day.
[09:16.910 --> 09:18.990]  Also, they stop you up if you got the squits.
[09:19.890 --> 09:19.990]  What?
[09:20.530 --> 09:21.650]  If you got the runs.
[09:22.030 --> 09:24.550]  What do you mean? What are you- are you saying what I think you're saying?
[09:25.030 --> 09:25.370]  Yeah.
[09:25.910 --> 09:26.130]  What?
[09:26.190 --> 09:30.010]  What? Go ahead. No, explain further.
[09:30.630 --> 09:31.810]  Well, you know what I'm talking about.
[09:32.190 --> 09:36.570]  Well, I kind of do, but I just am stunned that you immediately-
[09:36.570 --> 09:38.070]  that's where your brain went as a use for it.
[09:38.070 --> 09:40.150]  Oh, it's an absolute go-to. If you're shitting liquid,
[09:40.290 --> 09:43.150]  if you've been shitting liquid for a couple of days, get a couple of bananas down.
[09:43.610 --> 09:44.790]  I've always been sorted out by-
[09:44.790 --> 09:48.310]  You were not- no, there- this was a miscommunication.
[09:48.510 --> 09:51.210]  I greatly misinterpreted what you were advising.
[09:51.410 --> 09:52.150]  What did you think?
[09:52.550 --> 09:54.190]  I thought you were going to shove it up your ass.
[09:54.490 --> 09:57.730]  This was another apple conversation and it was awesome to watch.
[09:58.930 --> 10:02.810]  I thought that you were talking about corkscrewing your asshole with the banana.
[10:04.250 --> 10:07.070]  Well, I thought you're being facetious.
[10:07.230 --> 10:08.070]  I thought you're joking.
[10:08.230 --> 10:11.270]  Not that you were saying like if you eat it, it helps with the sore stomach.
[10:11.470 --> 10:12.570]  I thought you're making a joke.
[10:13.130 --> 10:14.690]  Really? You went there immediately?
[10:15.230 --> 10:17.130]  We clearly haven't recorded in a while.
[10:17.230 --> 10:20.790]  We're all like, I'm talking about iPhones, you're talking about eating fruit,
[10:21.050 --> 10:23.570]  I'm talking about eating bananas, you're talking about shoving them up my ass.
[10:23.650 --> 10:24.810]  We need to get on the same page.
[10:24.950 --> 10:27.170]  How do we get in sync? We are at a-
[10:27.870 --> 10:29.350]  We're f***ing faced out of sync.
[10:29.830 --> 10:31.090]  Stop riding roller coasters.
[10:31.510 --> 10:33.770]  I was thinking about, was it Beverly Hills Cop?
[10:34.250 --> 10:37.670]  Where he like takes the banana and shoves it in the car and it f***s the car up.
[10:37.870 --> 10:41.630]  So that's where I was thinking of banana insertion and then you said that.
[10:41.630 --> 10:43.810]  So that's where my brain went and I was baffled.
[10:43.990 --> 10:46.070]  I did use the phrase stops you up, I guess.
[10:46.270 --> 10:50.070]  But yeah, also solidifying fecal matter point of view.
[10:50.430 --> 10:53.150]  Also, bananas are high in potassium and that's good.
[10:53.210 --> 10:55.090]  If you like, you should eat a banana before you.
[10:55.190 --> 10:57.750]  Oh, shit, you're going to do your marathon at some point, right, Andrew?
[10:58.050 --> 11:00.070]  Yeah, you should eat some bananas before it.
[11:00.130 --> 11:01.370]  It'll help you with your-
[11:01.370 --> 11:05.130]  What do you think we're further from the marathon or Geoff throwing a ball?
[11:05.690 --> 11:09.450]  Oh, dude, I'm going to throw that ball pretty soon.
[11:09.450 --> 11:10.810]  I'm almost 100%.
[11:11.470 --> 11:12.050]  I'm close.
[11:12.250 --> 11:13.010]  Hey, how about this?
[11:13.270 --> 11:13.710]  Gav, what are you?
[11:13.710 --> 11:14.670]  Are you around this weekend?
[11:15.230 --> 11:15.450]  Yeah.
[11:15.890 --> 11:16.770]  Well, let's throw the ball.
[11:16.870 --> 11:16.950]  Yeah.
[11:17.450 --> 11:17.690]  Okay.
[11:17.850 --> 11:18.410]  On Saturday?
[11:18.890 --> 11:20.410]  Sure, if you want to, if you're free.
[11:20.950 --> 11:21.350]  Yeah.
[11:21.770 --> 11:23.050]  All right, we'll throw the ball Saturday.
[11:23.190 --> 11:23.650]  That was quick.
[11:23.730 --> 11:25.050]  I thought we were months out.
[11:25.410 --> 11:26.630]  Yeah, it seemed months out.
[11:26.790 --> 11:29.550]  You said like December was sort of-
[11:29.550 --> 11:37.530]  Well, I wanted some time to stretch and get my body ready, but I can't take too long because
[11:37.530 --> 11:41.910]  I have to allow for the idea that I might have another catastrophic and pointless injury in
[11:41.910 --> 11:44.250]  between and I don't want to keep kicking this down the road forever.
[11:44.570 --> 11:49.450]  So I'd rather set a shitty baseline and they just have greater improvement than do it properly.
[11:49.930 --> 11:51.310]  Andrew, do you want to run a marathon on Saturday?
[11:52.430 --> 11:53.150]  Uh, no.
[11:53.450 --> 11:54.010]  No, I don't.
[11:54.610 --> 11:55.910]  Well, looks like I win that.
[11:56.450 --> 11:57.390]  I feel like you've lost your confidence.
[11:58.090 --> 11:58.290]  Yeah.
[11:58.490 --> 11:59.550]  Well, no, I just-
[11:59.550 --> 11:59.930]  I don't-
[11:59.930 --> 12:02.070]  Listen, I don't buy that Geoff's throwing the baseball on Saturday.
[12:02.370 --> 12:05.730]  If he throws it on Saturday, will you run the marathon on the next Saturday?
[12:07.510 --> 12:08.930]  Sure, I'll start on the fall.
[12:09.050 --> 12:11.510]  Well, no, wait, wait a second, because we're going to talk about another thing
[12:11.510 --> 12:13.970]  that might lead into another thing that you don't know about.
[12:14.550 --> 12:15.010]  I'll do it.
[12:15.230 --> 12:17.830]  I'll do it after the Saturday at-
[12:17.830 --> 12:20.610]  Well, yeah, Saturday after the thing we'll talk about later.
[12:20.970 --> 12:22.190]  But what about your shoulder?
[12:22.310 --> 12:23.270]  Then you have to check your shoulder.
[12:23.350 --> 12:24.530]  Did you already go to the doctor?
[12:24.610 --> 12:25.210]  Are you all clear?
[12:25.270 --> 12:26.290]  Are you medically clear?
[12:26.570 --> 12:27.950]  Oh, because of the hernia?
[12:28.350 --> 12:28.550]  Yes.
[12:28.590 --> 12:31.950]  Yeah, I'm on the fence about whether I'm going to follow up on that or not.
[12:32.470 --> 12:34.830]  It was such an important detail last time.
[12:34.830 --> 12:35.710]  I know.
[12:35.810 --> 12:38.110]  Hasn't it been affecting you, like, your entire life?
[12:38.250 --> 12:40.130]  Yeah, for a couple of years.
[12:40.930 --> 12:43.450]  No, that's a hernia that my shoulder has been fucked for a while.
[12:43.530 --> 12:43.990]  That's different.
[12:44.130 --> 12:45.410]  I can't do anything about my shoulder.
[12:45.570 --> 12:45.950]  It's arthritis.
[12:46.270 --> 12:51.530]  I could get a cortisone shot if I need to, which will probably happen after I throw the ball.
[12:51.670 --> 12:54.890]  Probably have to get a big shot of cortisone in my shoulder.
[12:55.210 --> 12:55.610]  That'll be fun.
[12:56.810 --> 12:59.690]  But yeah, I'm prepared to do it because I care about this podcast.
[12:59.690 --> 13:04.930]  So on Saturday, I can mark on my calendar that you will throw this ball on Saturday.
[13:05.150 --> 13:06.330]  We will get a number for it.
[13:06.430 --> 13:09.510]  The only thing that could get in the way of me...
[13:09.510 --> 13:11.250]  Oh, F1 this weekend.
[13:11.510 --> 13:12.150]  Never mind.
[13:12.370 --> 13:13.290]  I gotta go to F1 this weekend.
[13:13.490 --> 13:14.390]  F1 is...
[13:14.390 --> 13:15.590]  Okay, no, it's not every weekend.
[13:15.810 --> 13:16.710]  It's like every few weekends.
[13:17.050 --> 13:17.670]  What do you mean you're going to F1?
[13:17.670 --> 13:18.630]  No, it's in Austin, dude.
[13:18.710 --> 13:19.270]  It's in Austin.
[13:19.270 --> 13:20.130]  Oh, it's in Austin?
[13:20.130 --> 13:21.150]  Okay, well, yeah.
[13:21.330 --> 13:22.650]  No, I have weekend tickets.
[13:23.510 --> 13:25.450]  So if I can throw it, like, I don't know what the schedule is,
[13:25.490 --> 13:27.590]  but if we can throw it before or after F1, we'll do it.
[13:27.650 --> 13:28.650]  Otherwise, I'm going to have to wait till Monday.
[13:28.650 --> 13:31.690]  Kevin, you're giving me shit about not committing to Saturday.
[13:31.990 --> 13:33.530]  Two minutes later, Geoff's bumping it.
[13:33.930 --> 13:34.330]  We've already...
[13:34.330 --> 13:36.410]  I just forgot about F1, but I still want to fit it in.
[13:36.450 --> 13:37.890]  I still want to fit it in.
[13:38.030 --> 13:38.210]  This weekend.
[13:38.210 --> 13:39.610]  Do it at the F1 track.
[13:40.110 --> 13:40.850]  Do you have tickets?
[13:41.490 --> 13:41.710]  No.
[13:42.470 --> 13:44.630]  Well, it's going to be hard for you to fucking be there then, isn't it?
[13:45.590 --> 13:46.090]  All right.
[13:46.370 --> 13:49.450]  Now that we're 16 minutes into this podcast...
[13:50.310 --> 13:52.510]  Well, with the part we didn't...
[13:52.510 --> 13:53.230]  That wasn't a part of...
[13:53.230 --> 13:54.490]  Maybe we're like 14 minutes in.
[13:54.770 --> 13:56.170]  Anyway, we should probably...
[13:56.170 --> 13:58.390]  Andrew, I have notes of what you wanted to talk about today.
[13:58.390 --> 14:00.650]  Gavin, I don't know if you had anything.
[14:01.370 --> 14:02.590]  I only had one thing.
[14:03.030 --> 14:04.150]  Why don't you hit us with it?
[14:04.410 --> 14:06.950]  Well, it's kind of similar to all the flavors we've been talking about.
[14:07.170 --> 14:10.770]  And the fact that I hadn't had any confidence yet on F***face.
[14:11.030 --> 14:12.070]  I found my confidence.
[14:13.390 --> 14:14.550]  What is your confidence?
[14:15.210 --> 14:18.410]  I felt like I was chocolate confident.
[14:18.890 --> 14:25.570]  Like, you know how you get those lint excellence things where it's like 70% cocoa?
[14:26.070 --> 14:27.710]  And I was like, I'm pretty...
[14:27.710 --> 14:30.810]  I like these pretty extreme percentages on chocolate.
[14:30.990 --> 14:32.670]  It's like really dark, a little bit bitter.
[14:32.950 --> 14:35.290]  And I was looking through all the chocolates in the store.
[14:35.370 --> 14:36.330]  It's like 70%.
[14:36.330 --> 14:38.970]  Oh, bloody hell, 80, 85.
[14:39.350 --> 14:40.550]  And then I saw one that was 100.
[14:41.050 --> 14:42.790]  And I thought, I'm bloody...
[14:42.790 --> 14:44.310]  I'm really going to like that one.
[14:44.650 --> 14:49.150]  So I bought lint excellence, 100% cocoa.
[14:49.890 --> 14:54.450]  Let me chuck this in the old Discord so we know what we're talking about.
[14:55.070 --> 14:55.810]  Oh, an update!
[14:56.190 --> 14:56.790]  Discord update!
[14:58.490 --> 14:59.230]  What's new?
[14:59.690 --> 15:00.470]  All right, hold on here.
[15:00.650 --> 15:00.970]  Here we go.
[15:01.290 --> 15:04.010]  We're so bad at posting things when we're talking about them.
[15:04.250 --> 15:07.330]  Does it... we're 74 weeks in or whatever.
[15:07.630 --> 15:08.470]  We still suck at that.
[15:08.850 --> 15:09.090]  Bam.
[15:09.430 --> 15:10.470]  All right, that's in there.
[15:10.790 --> 15:11.570]  There's nothing.
[15:12.030 --> 15:13.010]  There we go.
[15:13.210 --> 15:15.950]  Okay, so we're talking chocolate bars specifically.
[15:16.110 --> 15:18.130]  I wasn't sure if you meant like a hot chocolate powder.
[15:18.530 --> 15:21.270]  No, I was like, you break it off, you eat it.
[15:21.670 --> 15:23.750]  And I was like, oh, this is gonna...
[15:23.750 --> 15:25.250]  I'm bloody gonna love this.
[15:25.490 --> 15:27.050]  But then there's a disclaimer on it.
[15:27.050 --> 15:32.070]  It said, excellence 100% reveals the strength and richness of cocoa beans.
[15:32.710 --> 15:34.970]  Flavor profile delivers a strong blah, blah, blah.
[15:35.170 --> 15:38.330]  To fully appreciate the intense cocoa experience,
[15:38.690 --> 15:41.710]  we recommend that you progressively develop your palate
[15:42.330 --> 15:46.350]  through our range of high cocoa content chocolate bars,
[15:46.670 --> 15:51.990]  starting with excellence 70%, then 85%, then 90%.
[15:52.510 --> 15:55.090]  I thought, well, I've not done any of that.
[15:55.090 --> 15:56.330]  I'm going in the deep end here.
[15:57.250 --> 16:01.470]  I was like, I'm pretty sure I've trained my palate already throughout life.
[16:01.790 --> 16:01.910]  Yeah.
[16:02.010 --> 16:06.030]  I snapped off a bit of this chocolate, shoved it in.
[16:07.530 --> 16:12.410]  By far the most disgusting thing I've ever eaten in my entire life.
[16:12.570 --> 16:16.430]  It immediately turned to mud and like rushed.
[16:16.530 --> 16:19.090]  It was the bitterest I've never experienced.
[16:19.950 --> 16:21.010]  They were not kidding.
[16:21.010 --> 16:23.830]  My palate, I was immediately just like,
[16:25.270 --> 16:27.730]  I was like dry heaving.
[16:27.810 --> 16:29.790]  I couldn't get it out because it just turned to paste.
[16:35.130 --> 16:40.250]  So it was overconfidence, massive misjudgment there on the old tongue.
[16:40.330 --> 16:44.270]  So I think I do have to slowly work up to 70%.
[16:44.270 --> 16:46.690]  I would love you both to try it.
[16:46.690 --> 16:48.150]  I'm not sure if you're a big chocolate guys.
[16:48.150 --> 16:50.750]  It was utterly foul.
[16:51.290 --> 16:53.170]  I don't know how it's even food.
[16:53.550 --> 16:57.210]  How quickly do you think you could eat the entire chocolate bar, Gavin?
[16:57.990 --> 16:58.910]  Oh, I couldn't.
[16:58.970 --> 16:59.410]  I couldn't eat.
[16:59.510 --> 16:59.930]  I couldn't.
[17:00.030 --> 17:01.350]  I don't think I could eat.
[17:01.730 --> 17:02.450]  Zero quickly.
[17:03.250 --> 17:03.930]  Three minutes.
[17:04.050 --> 17:06.090]  Let me show you how much I ate.
[17:08.150 --> 17:09.430]  I'll show you how much I ate.
[17:09.930 --> 17:12.310]  So when you were, when you're reading the bottom part of it,
[17:12.330 --> 17:15.630]  with the like start 75, 80, what was your thought process?
[17:15.690 --> 17:17.030]  Were you like, this is like...
[17:17.030 --> 17:18.170]  I was laughing at it.
[17:18.350 --> 17:18.550]  Like what?
[17:18.730 --> 17:19.030]  Yeah.
[17:19.450 --> 17:21.150]  What dumb thing to write on your chocolate.
[17:21.430 --> 17:27.170]  So you still had 100% confidence until you put it in your mouth.
[17:27.310 --> 17:29.160]  I had 100% until I ate the 100%.
[17:29.990 --> 17:31.130]  And oh my God.
[17:31.990 --> 17:35.950]  I, I literally don't think I could eat the rest of that in, if I,
[17:36.050 --> 17:38.110]  if you gave me 24 hours, I wouldn't all go in.
[17:38.390 --> 17:43.030]  So in 24 hours, that's 20, that's 21 bars or 21 little squares.
[17:43.270 --> 17:46.130]  So you don't think you could eat one an hour with three hours to breathe?
[17:46.130 --> 17:49.430]  No, I think I would throw up after the first one.
[17:49.570 --> 17:51.610]  And I would just be looking at the rest for the rest of the day.
[17:51.690 --> 17:52.710]  And it wouldn't happen.
[17:52.830 --> 17:55.790]  Next time we record, not next episode, because we're doing two today.
[17:56.050 --> 17:59.150]  I will eat that whole fucking thing in like four minutes.
[18:00.790 --> 18:02.810]  I've never had it, but yeah, it's chocolate.
[18:02.810 --> 18:05.010]  No, can you do something else for me too?
[18:05.330 --> 18:08.570]  It's not chocolate. It's not chocolate. I don't know what it is. It's not chocolate.
[18:08.830 --> 18:09.710]  Looks like chocolate.
[18:10.330 --> 18:10.990]  Yes, Geoff.
[18:11.290 --> 18:14.610]  Andrew, I love this idea. I think this is a great idea. I support it.
[18:14.610 --> 18:17.510]  However, I think it would be even better.
[18:18.870 --> 18:22.910]  It would be even better if you washed it down with a banana.
[18:24.130 --> 18:24.610]  Why?
[18:25.230 --> 18:28.610]  I want to hear you eat a good banana on podcast.
[18:29.410 --> 18:29.630]  OK.
[18:29.710 --> 18:31.030]  I think Gavin and I are on to something.
[18:31.430 --> 18:33.650]  We both think you haven't eaten one in a long time.
[18:34.070 --> 18:41.430]  And I'd like to get your up to the date, like two day Andrew Panton 2021 opinion on bananas.
[18:41.430 --> 18:44.750]  I don't think I want to combine the two, though, but I will do both.
[18:44.830 --> 18:46.010]  I'm open to both. Absolutely.
[18:46.230 --> 18:46.790]  I just don't.
[18:47.010 --> 18:47.390]  Do the banana first.
[18:47.870 --> 18:51.350]  I don't see. I feel like I hate bananas so much in my head.
[18:51.410 --> 18:54.370]  I feel like it will throw me off my chocolate eating game for later.
[18:54.730 --> 19:00.130]  Do this. Do this. Do the chocolate, then rub your foot in ginger and then eat the banana.
[19:01.470 --> 19:03.470]  I'll tell you after one bite of this chocolate,
[19:03.690 --> 19:06.450]  you would eat a whole bunch of bananas just to get the taste out of your mouth.
[19:06.910 --> 19:11.190]  It's like four hours of just be like every every so often the flavor would
[19:11.190 --> 19:15.350]  re-hit my tongue and I'd be like, you know what?
[19:15.550 --> 19:17.210]  I like that idea. I'll go chocolate first.
[19:17.670 --> 19:19.990]  Palate cleanse with the banana. Give it a try.
[19:20.270 --> 19:24.850]  What is interesting, though, is that the entire bar is one serving.
[19:25.350 --> 19:25.930]  Are you serious?
[19:26.370 --> 19:29.990]  Yeah. When you have like a like a bag or something or like something that needs to be.
[19:30.290 --> 19:33.490]  It's like, oh, this bag contains 18 servings of this or whatever.
[19:33.590 --> 19:34.850]  But it's the whole thing is just one.
[19:34.850 --> 19:38.770]  So I think eating the whole thing in one go won't be too bad for you.
[19:39.250 --> 19:43.190]  So now that you've eaten the 100 percent, do you think you need to start at 75?
[19:43.470 --> 19:47.290]  Do you feel like you're at 85? If you could go to 50, would you go to 50?
[19:47.390 --> 19:50.530]  Like, where do you think your taste range is at this point?
[19:50.770 --> 19:51.990]  Well, like, has it set me back?
[19:52.370 --> 19:53.390]  Yeah, well, I'm just curious.
[19:53.410 --> 19:57.210]  Like, what do you think your actual ideal number is now that you know it's not 100?
[19:57.630 --> 20:02.790]  Well, I do like 70, so I just love that there's an 85 and a 90.
[20:02.790 --> 20:07.710]  Like, it's significant enough between 5 percent to warrant a completely different chocolate bar.
[20:08.170 --> 20:09.810]  I think I'd do 85.
[20:10.330 --> 20:10.570]  Okay.
[20:10.870 --> 20:14.770]  Do you think you could get to 100 if you trained in the Lindt way?
[20:15.330 --> 20:17.730]  Like, according to the disclaimer on the packet, I could.
[20:18.630 --> 20:24.790]  I'd say if I ate 70 one month, 85 the next month, 90 the next month.
[20:24.870 --> 20:26.850]  Yeah, I think give me three months, I could try 100 again.
[20:28.070 --> 20:31.090]  I think I like the long play on this.
[20:31.090 --> 20:34.290]  I think we should do that in tandem with the other Andrew thing.
[20:34.590 --> 20:35.370]  I'd like to see.
[20:35.490 --> 20:37.950]  I'd like to see if I'd like to see the experiment.
[20:38.290 --> 20:40.290]  I'd like to see this in action.
[20:40.530 --> 20:41.930]  I'd like to see if it's possible.
[20:42.410 --> 20:44.350]  I want to know if you want to achieve it.
[20:44.390 --> 20:47.430]  Or do you think you would feel like a monster by the end of it?
[20:47.470 --> 20:49.810]  If you hit 100 and it was just like nothing.
[20:49.950 --> 20:50.290]  Oh, no way.
[20:50.390 --> 20:51.390]  I'd be so proud of it.
[20:51.430 --> 20:52.430]  It'd be something to brag about.
[20:53.030 --> 20:53.830]  Yeah, I would.
[20:54.250 --> 20:54.790]  I break.
[20:54.910 --> 20:57.010]  I break off a little square for everyone around me.
[20:57.010 --> 20:58.190]  I'd be like, all right, let's talk.
[20:58.730 --> 21:00.750]  I'd be the only one that wasn't rolling on the ground.
[21:01.090 --> 21:03.010]  Yeah, I like it.
[21:03.170 --> 21:04.470]  I really don't.
[21:04.850 --> 21:05.770]  What, like four minutes?
[21:05.930 --> 21:06.930]  Is four minutes weird?
[21:07.430 --> 21:09.850]  Should it be like five just so it's an easier number?
[21:10.130 --> 21:10.910]  Yeah, let's do five.
[21:11.670 --> 21:13.810]  Yeah, they have a 99% coca.
[21:15.110 --> 21:15.730]  Do they?
[21:16.090 --> 21:16.470]  They do.
[21:16.950 --> 21:18.290]  I'm no, no, I'm looking at it right now.
[21:18.390 --> 21:18.770]  I'm pulling up.
[21:18.890 --> 21:19.350]  I'm trying to look.
[21:19.430 --> 21:19.670]  I didn't.
[21:19.770 --> 21:21.110]  You're like 85, 90.
[21:21.190 --> 21:21.850]  They have a fucking...
[21:21.850 --> 21:25.170]  What is the difference between a 99% and a 100?
[21:25.630 --> 21:26.410]  Oh, I don't know.
[21:26.990 --> 21:29.870]  It doesn't even mention the 99% on the disclaimer.
[21:29.870 --> 21:31.190]  There's a 95, 90.
[21:31.950 --> 21:33.670]  They're just like, that's the the end zone.
[21:34.250 --> 21:36.430]  99 to 100, same thing, I assume.
[21:36.990 --> 21:38.610]  I don't think you could do that in five minutes.
[21:38.750 --> 21:39.230]  I really don't.
[21:39.290 --> 21:42.510]  Have you had extremely high cocoa content chocolate before?
[21:42.650 --> 21:44.230]  No, I don't even like dark chocolate.
[21:44.550 --> 21:45.170]  Not a fan.
[21:46.630 --> 21:47.730]  I really don't.
[21:47.790 --> 21:50.050]  If we're placing bets on it, I don't think you can do it physically.
[21:50.430 --> 21:51.210]  I don't think you can get it down.
[21:51.730 --> 21:52.270]  Oh, I will.
[21:52.510 --> 21:55.490]  Oh, if we're getting bets involved, this is...
[21:55.490 --> 21:56.850]  Now I'm excited about this.
[21:57.070 --> 21:58.770]  I think you found your confidence too.
[21:58.770 --> 22:01.350]  Oh, I'm absolutely chocolate confident.
[22:01.490 --> 22:03.110]  I'm not even all that into chocolate.
[22:03.410 --> 22:06.450]  As we said last episode, not a big sweets guy.
[22:06.910 --> 22:07.470]  They're okay.
[22:07.810 --> 22:08.570]  Well, it's not...
[22:09.270 --> 22:10.670]  I don't think it's sweet at all.
[22:11.090 --> 22:11.910]  Well, it's chocolates.
[22:12.030 --> 22:13.070]  It's in the candy category.
[22:13.450 --> 22:14.470]  I know it's not sweet.
[22:14.550 --> 22:16.450]  Total sugars, zero grams.
[22:17.050 --> 22:18.290]  But you would put...
[22:18.290 --> 22:22.530]  If somebody has a candy bar, you'd put it in the candy section.
[22:22.830 --> 22:23.510]  It's a chocolate bar.
[22:23.610 --> 22:24.430]  It's in the candy aisle.
[22:24.770 --> 22:25.550]  It's in the sweet aisle.
[22:26.110 --> 22:27.770]  No, but it's like all bitter.
[22:28.430 --> 22:30.770]  I mean, we'll find out when you eat it.
[22:30.810 --> 22:31.510]  But wait a second.
[22:32.130 --> 22:34.070]  Eric just said it's in the baking section.
[22:34.210 --> 22:35.370]  Is it in the baking section?
[22:35.890 --> 22:37.290]  No, this was in the chocolate section.
[22:37.530 --> 22:38.210]  There we go.
[22:41.450 --> 22:42.550]  I'm so excited for this.
[22:42.590 --> 22:44.010]  I wish we could get some delivered to you today.
[22:44.170 --> 22:46.290]  I genuinely, if you would have just...
[22:46.290 --> 22:48.590]  If you would have texted about it, I would have it ready to go.
[22:49.310 --> 22:52.570]  There's zero hesitation in my mind that I could just immediately do this.
[22:55.210 --> 22:56.210]  Can I get one?
[22:56.410 --> 22:57.530]  Let me see if I can get one.
[22:57.530 --> 22:59.330]  See if you can get one delivered while we're...
[22:59.330 --> 23:00.370]  Because we haven't tested it.
[23:00.390 --> 23:02.630]  I'm going to look right now to see if I can get one delivered.
[23:02.770 --> 23:08.730]  I highly doubt that I could get a fucking lint 100% dark chocolate bar delivered in this moment.
[23:09.110 --> 23:09.970]  But I will try.
[23:10.430 --> 23:11.390]  I'll look into this.
[23:12.270 --> 23:15.570]  Gavin, do you feel a bit like a failure?
[23:16.150 --> 23:17.450]  Because you couldn't eat it?
[23:17.530 --> 23:17.910]  Yeah.
[23:18.030 --> 23:20.130]  Like you're not the chocolate fan you thought you were?
[23:20.970 --> 23:21.490]  Yeah, thanks.
[23:21.730 --> 23:22.430]  Thanks for asking.
[23:22.530 --> 23:23.330]  I do feel like a failure.
[23:24.310 --> 23:27.290]  I would have read that disclaimer at the bottom and would have been like,
[23:27.290 --> 23:28.610]  chocolate snobs.
[23:28.850 --> 23:31.710]  I would have put that absolutely in the snob category of people.
[23:32.930 --> 23:36.510]  Oh, I assume before we move on to the important stuff, I do have a clip to play.
[23:36.850 --> 23:37.330]  Oh.
[23:38.170 --> 23:40.350]  From last week's podcast.
[23:40.970 --> 23:41.170]  Oh.
[23:41.290 --> 23:41.590]  Oh, great.
[23:41.970 --> 23:42.530]  I don't...
[23:42.530 --> 23:42.750]  Okay.
[23:43.730 --> 23:45.450]  This is one of the ads.
[23:46.010 --> 23:49.110]  This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp and F*** Face listeners.

[23:53.710 --> 23:57.270]  That's B-E-T-T-E-R-H-L-E-P.com.
[23:59.770 --> 24:01.850]  We had an ad read for BetterPlan.
[24:04.370 --> 24:05.250]  Oh, no.
[24:09.210 --> 24:10.030]  Oh, my God.
[24:12.230 --> 24:14.470]  Does anyone listen to...
[24:14.470 --> 24:16.130]  I'm the only one listening to these.
[24:16.930 --> 24:19.710]  And I don't get the version with the ads in, so I couldn't proof that.
[24:20.350 --> 24:21.230]  That's amazing.
[24:21.710 --> 24:22.670]  Oh, my God.
[24:23.410 --> 24:24.510]  Is that the first time, Geoff?
[24:24.570 --> 24:25.470]  I guess you wouldn't know.
[24:25.990 --> 24:26.610]  I don't know.
[24:26.610 --> 24:29.930]  Have you ever been told, hey, you spelled the thing wrong?
[24:30.130 --> 24:31.210]  H-L-E-P.
[24:34.110 --> 24:35.610]  That's a first for me.
[24:37.450 --> 24:40.090]  Nick, equally responsible.
[24:41.350 --> 24:42.150]  Does he...
[24:42.150 --> 24:44.110]  Is he there when you record or you just deliver him to him?
[24:44.410 --> 24:46.870]  No, I deliver him to him, but I always talk to him.
[24:46.930 --> 24:49.070]  And I have a little conversations with him and stuff.
[24:49.110 --> 24:50.250]  So I might have distracted him.
[24:50.730 --> 24:51.630]  I mean, it might still work.
[24:51.730 --> 24:54.330]  Maybe they've redirected BetterHelp to their website.
[24:55.830 --> 24:58.010]  Is BetterHelp available to buy?
[24:58.490 --> 24:59.250]  Can we go BetterHelp?
[24:59.290 --> 25:00.070]  Thanks, Nick.
[25:00.830 --> 25:02.370]  Nick said it's really nice.
[25:02.650 --> 25:03.510]  I appreciate it, buddy.
[25:05.810 --> 25:07.610]  Oh, man, that's really...
[25:09.850 --> 25:11.870]  That's legitimately embarrassing.
[25:16.730 --> 25:20.050]  Yeah, I don't get embarrassed very often, but I think that one got me.
[25:23.970 --> 25:24.410]  Wow.
[25:24.630 --> 25:26.490]  I was cracking up when I heard it.
[25:27.350 --> 25:28.310]  That was you.
[25:28.470 --> 25:29.390]  That was the...
[25:29.390 --> 25:30.950]  That was my embarrassment for 2021.
[25:31.250 --> 25:32.430]  You fucking nailed it.
[25:32.810 --> 25:33.850]  Thanks for catching that.
[25:34.510 --> 25:35.090]  So glad.
[25:35.490 --> 25:36.670]  So glad you didn't let that go.
[25:37.130 --> 25:38.850]  It's very clear what you're trying to spell.
[25:39.210 --> 25:40.690]  I don't think there's any confusion there.
[25:40.770 --> 25:42.990]  I don't think anyone got lost.
[25:43.730 --> 25:44.170]  Do you...
[25:44.170 --> 25:47.690]  If you were in Nick's position and let's say Nick did catch it.
[25:47.770 --> 25:48.730]  Do you correct, Geoff?
[25:48.730 --> 25:50.190]  Do you tell him that he misspelled?
[25:50.350 --> 25:51.730]  Yeah, I think you have to.
[25:52.530 --> 25:53.910]  I think you have to.
[25:54.370 --> 25:59.710]  I would probably just see if I could cut up the waveforms and rearrange it.
[26:00.930 --> 26:01.370]  Yeah.
[26:04.090 --> 26:05.310]  That was fantastic.
[26:05.310 --> 26:09.690]  Let's go ahead and invoice them for the additional advertisement they got on this podcast.
[26:10.530 --> 26:14.330]  Yeah, I feel like I always make sure that there's no ads in the first version.
[26:14.530 --> 26:15.910]  But there is this week.
[26:19.450 --> 26:22.950]  Any other embarrassing shit you got for us?
[26:23.290 --> 26:23.670]  That's all I got.
[26:28.240 --> 26:32.620]  Are you the kind of person who falls asleep already thinking about the next morning's coffee?
[26:33.140 --> 26:38.720]  Well, Trade's goal is to make sure that every cup of coffee you have is your best ever.
[26:39.080 --> 26:42.580]  The journey to your perfect cup starts with taking their coffee quiz.
[26:42.780 --> 26:43.940]  Everybody loves quizzes.
[26:44.300 --> 26:45.860]  America is obsessed with tests.
[26:46.080 --> 26:48.460]  The whole world even, because I realize this is a global podcast.
[26:48.820 --> 26:49.780]  Do you use a French press?
[26:50.080 --> 26:50.320]  No.
[26:50.440 --> 26:51.340]  Do you use an automatic drip?
[26:51.340 --> 26:55.100]  I personally don't care as long as you are enjoying your coffee.
[26:55.420 --> 26:56.800]  Are you a cold brew person?
[26:57.120 --> 26:58.040]  Well, no problem.
[26:58.060 --> 27:03.500]  Because your answers will allow Trade to pair you with the perfect coffee to fit your tastes.
[27:03.920 --> 27:07.680]  Trade will match you to coffees you'll love from over 400 craft coffees
[27:07.680 --> 27:11.360]  and will send you a freshly roasted bag as often as you would like.
[27:11.740 --> 27:13.000]  You get 10 a day if you want.
[27:13.240 --> 27:13.760]  I don't care.
[27:14.180 --> 27:16.320]  That might be a lot of caffeine for you.
[27:16.360 --> 27:17.080]  But I don't know you.
[27:17.120 --> 27:18.880]  I don't understand how your body chemistry works.
[27:18.880 --> 27:21.200]  I don't know your individual makeup.
[27:21.740 --> 27:25.380]  However, I do know that you deserve good coffee.
[27:25.580 --> 27:27.700]  And you can give them feedback as you sip.
[27:27.880 --> 27:30.520]  Because as your preferences evolve, your coffee matches will too.
[27:30.820 --> 27:35.480]  And you can feel good about each cup since Trade partners with 55 plus,
[27:35.860 --> 27:37.680]  I believe that means more than 55,
[27:38.180 --> 27:42.140]  U.S.-based roasters who are committed to ethical and sustainable sourcing.
[27:42.400 --> 27:46.200]  So for our listeners, right now, Trade is offering your first bag free

[28:05.020 --> 28:05.420]  Enjoy!
[28:05.940 --> 28:10.280]  We all shop online and we've all seen that promo code field taunt us at checkout.
[28:10.580 --> 28:14.760]  But thanks to Honey, manually searching for coupon codes is a thing of the past.
[28:14.760 --> 28:18.280]  Honey is the free shopping tool that scours the internet for promo codes
[28:18.280 --> 28:20.640]  and applies the best one it finds to your cart.
[28:21.200 --> 28:23.840]  Honey supports over 30,000 stores online.
[28:23.980 --> 28:26.800]  That's more than you could ever hope to shop at in your lifetime,
[28:26.900 --> 28:29.740]  unless you're like, we're like Bezos rich.
[28:30.200 --> 28:32.800]  And they range from sites that have tech and gaming products
[28:32.800 --> 28:35.540]  to popular fashion brands and even food delivery.
[28:35.940 --> 28:36.700]  Let me explain how it works.
[28:36.940 --> 28:38.700]  Imagine you're shopping on one of your favorite sites.
[28:38.800 --> 28:43.460]  Like for me, it might be related to ceramic spoons and thimbles.
[28:43.460 --> 28:44.840]  I don't know what you got it.
[28:44.980 --> 28:46.500]  Maybe that's what I shop for. Maybe it's not.
[28:46.580 --> 28:47.380]  I don't know what you shop for.
[28:47.700 --> 28:50.340]  Personally, I don't care as long as you're happy when you do it.
[28:50.480 --> 28:53.520]  When you go to the checkout, the Honey button is going to drop down.
[28:53.620 --> 28:55.940]  Then all you have to do is click apply coupons.
[28:56.140 --> 28:59.900]  You wait a few seconds as Honey searches the entire internet for coupons
[28:59.900 --> 29:01.720]  that it can find for that site.
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.260]  And then if it finds one, boom, watch your prices drop.
[29:05.480 --> 29:07.200]  You've heard me talk about my standup paddle boards.
[29:07.280 --> 29:10.260]  I got crazy discount, thanks to my girlfriend and Honey.
[29:10.700 --> 29:12.100]  And I haven't been able to use them lately
[29:12.100 --> 29:13.720]  because the water has been trash in Austin.
[29:13.980 --> 29:16.860]  But I did get them at a tremendous savings, thanks to Honey.
[29:17.240 --> 29:22.940]  And they found it's over 17 million members, $2 billion in savings.
[29:23.040 --> 29:27.460]  With $2 billion, you could shop at, I don't know, 30,000 stores online probably.
[29:27.900 --> 29:31.380]  If you don't already have Honey, you could be straight up missing out on free savings.
[29:31.520 --> 29:33.920]  It is literally free and installs in a few seconds.
[29:34.060 --> 29:37.660]  And by getting it, you're doing yourself a solid and supporting this podcast.
[29:38.040 --> 29:39.800]  I would never recommend something I don't use.
[29:39.800 --> 29:43.580]  So get Honey for free at joinhoney.com slash face.
[29:43.720 --> 29:47.120]  That is joinhoney.com slash face.
[29:48.660 --> 29:54.080]  Andrew, you said yesterday that you wanted to give a Cosmic Crisp update.
[29:54.480 --> 29:55.760]  Oh, I do.
[29:55.880 --> 29:56.940]  I have a brief update.
[29:57.400 --> 30:01.060]  Obviously, apples, the top fruit, a top tier fruit.
[30:01.680 --> 30:04.000]  I reached, it's not a substantial, but I did.
[30:04.080 --> 30:07.520]  I reached out to the Cosmic Crisp people and I got a reply.
[30:07.980 --> 30:09.800]  And I got other contact information.
[30:10.040 --> 30:13.480]  So we need to like figure out what we want to ask them, I guess, request.
[30:13.880 --> 30:16.300]  But we want apples that we can review and talk about.
[30:16.460 --> 30:22.920]  Okay. And also, we want to be listed as official spokespeople for the Cosmic Crisp.
[30:23.260 --> 30:23.980]  See, that's why I asked.
[30:24.080 --> 30:25.900]  I just, now we have, we have a direct line.
[30:26.120 --> 30:28.360]  You're making it sound like it was a brand new apple though.
[30:28.400 --> 30:30.080]  But apparently people have been eating them for years.
[30:30.260 --> 30:33.280]  Well, they beta tested around, I'm sure, like anything.
[30:33.580 --> 30:36.900]  Like I saw some people say, hey, I live in Washington and we've had this
[30:36.900 --> 30:38.840]  apple for about a year. It's really good.
[30:39.100 --> 30:41.060]  And then I've also heard other people say like, yeah, I've been drinking,
[30:41.160 --> 30:43.080]  I've been eating caramel crisp all year.
[30:43.140 --> 30:44.360]  And it's like, that's not the apple, buddy.
[30:44.780 --> 30:46.140]  It's Cosmic Crisp. You're confused.
[30:46.380 --> 30:48.960]  I think a lot of people are confused because they hear the word cosmic
[30:48.960 --> 30:52.900]  and they hear the word crisp because it's the combination of two other apples, I believe.
[30:53.080 --> 30:53.220]  Right.
[30:53.280 --> 30:55.560]  So I think there's a lot of people that think they're eating Cosmic Crisp
[30:55.560 --> 30:58.400]  because they recognized our word, not both words.
[30:58.760 --> 30:59.520]  So interesting.
[31:00.020 --> 31:02.600]  If I'm eating, are you going to, you should get some apples, Geoff.
[31:02.640 --> 31:05.440]  If I'm going to eat this banana, you need to get some apples.
[31:05.920 --> 31:10.080]  One could just like bite in and like figure out the range of flavors and textures
[31:10.080 --> 31:11.420]  because it's crazy you don't know.
[31:11.600 --> 31:12.360]  You know, it's funny.
[31:12.540 --> 31:15.700]  I have it listed right here as things to talk about today.
[31:16.220 --> 31:20.200]  Apple rank. I think that we should start ranking apples.
[31:20.360 --> 31:23.380]  I think this would be an interesting direction for us to go in.
[31:23.800 --> 31:28.800]  If we could create like the official apple ranking guide so that people know,
[31:29.060 --> 31:31.640]  you know, we could come up with like, we come up with texture,
[31:32.620 --> 31:34.480]  flavor, crispiness, whatever we determine.
[31:34.480 --> 31:37.260]  And then we could become the authority on apples.
[31:37.620 --> 31:38.780]  I'm a big fan of this.
[31:39.100 --> 31:40.900]  Apple is genuinely my favorite fruit.
[31:41.340 --> 31:41.940]  It's a great fruit.
[31:42.040 --> 31:42.380]  Are you serious?
[31:42.540 --> 31:44.040]  It's such a nothing fruit to me.
[31:44.160 --> 31:45.880]  Get the fuck out of here.
[31:46.260 --> 31:48.240]  I'm never going to go and buy one.
[31:48.740 --> 31:49.180]  It is.
[31:49.320 --> 31:51.660]  No, I buy a shit ton of apples.
[31:51.880 --> 31:52.300]  They're great.
[31:52.420 --> 31:52.760]  I'm with Gavin.
[31:52.940 --> 31:55.220]  That's that's why that's why this is important, Andrew.
[31:55.640 --> 31:57.200]  You're through your love of apples.
[31:57.260 --> 32:00.960]  You're going to you're going to introduce it to us and probably the rest of the world
[32:00.960 --> 32:03.380]  who thinks that an apple is nothing more than a bog standard.
[32:03.380 --> 32:08.360]  I am not going to take this fucking apple slander by a guy that can't eat a chocolate bar
[32:08.360 --> 32:09.360]  and someone who can't spell.
[32:09.680 --> 32:11.220]  I'm not taking it right now.
[32:11.400 --> 32:15.160]  Apple is the top tier number one fruit and it will be established.
[32:15.360 --> 32:16.320]  It's a great juice.
[32:16.580 --> 32:17.800]  It's a great pie.
[32:18.120 --> 32:19.540]  It's just great by itself.
[32:19.600 --> 32:20.300]  It's portable.
[32:20.720 --> 32:21.860]  It's fantastic.
[32:22.040 --> 32:24.740]  In our text conversation the other day, I said, uh, apples.
[32:24.900 --> 32:25.820]  This really annoyed you.
[32:26.100 --> 32:27.040]  Apples are fodder fruit.
[32:27.180 --> 32:29.460]  It's the melon of a fruit salad of fruit.
[32:30.260 --> 32:30.860]  It's not.
[32:31.200 --> 32:34.460]  What is the problem with that statement for me?
[32:34.620 --> 32:36.040]  I got a lot of issues with it.
[32:36.140 --> 32:37.080]  And you're getting me.
[32:37.080 --> 32:38.720]  You're getting me revved up about apples.
[32:39.360 --> 32:40.680]  I fucking love an apple.
[32:41.060 --> 32:43.080]  When am I eating an apple in a fruit salad?
[32:43.400 --> 32:46.620]  And like, I would never want the melon is what I'd want.
[32:46.680 --> 32:48.480]  The pineapple is great in a fruit salad.
[32:48.560 --> 32:49.200]  Some grapes.
[32:49.380 --> 32:51.100]  Like there are so many great fruits.
[32:52.200 --> 32:52.900]  Wait, is it?
[32:52.920 --> 32:53.420]  Wait, what?
[32:54.640 --> 32:55.300]  What are you saying?
[32:55.300 --> 32:58.700]  I got confused while I was trying to think about what I was going to say while you were talking.
[33:01.340 --> 33:05.400]  I was saying that one, I don't feel like apple is in fruit salads.
[33:05.740 --> 33:06.200]  No, no.
[33:06.540 --> 33:10.240]  The point is, is that in a fruit salad, a melon is fodder.
[33:10.260 --> 33:12.360]  No, a melon is a staple of a fruit salad.
[33:13.000 --> 33:13.840]  It takes up space.
[33:14.220 --> 33:14.740]  You need a melon.
[33:15.420 --> 33:17.480]  You're excited about the pineapple.
[33:17.760 --> 33:19.200]  You're excited about the grapes in there.
[33:19.360 --> 33:20.860]  It's like melon, whatever.
[33:21.320 --> 33:28.020]  And I'm saying that apples are the melon of a fruit salad of fruit.
[33:28.020 --> 33:31.340]  I understand your point, but I disagree about them being fodder.
[33:31.460 --> 33:33.220]  I think they're a key part of the fruit salad.
[33:33.380 --> 33:36.120]  I think a fruit salad is a collection of pieces together.
[33:36.520 --> 33:37.980]  You have your melon or the apple?
[33:38.320 --> 33:38.700]  The melon.
[33:38.840 --> 33:40.680]  I'm saying we're talking fruit salad now.
[33:40.740 --> 33:42.160]  Now we're talking about fruit salad.
[33:42.420 --> 33:44.520]  I think the melon in a fruit salad is important.
[33:44.920 --> 33:46.480]  I don't think it's comparable at all to apple.
[33:46.580 --> 33:50.580]  Now I will say, in addition to that, I don't mind apple in a fruit salad.
[33:50.800 --> 33:52.740]  I think actually that makes it a little bit more exciting.
[33:52.920 --> 33:55.080]  I feel like you never get an apple in a fruit salad.
[33:55.660 --> 33:56.640]  You do sometimes.
[33:56.640 --> 33:58.580]  I feel like it's very rare.
[33:58.760 --> 33:59.740]  You know what?
[33:59.900 --> 34:02.300]  Fruit salad, grapes, pineapple, melon.
[34:02.460 --> 34:05.300]  I hope this isn't a controversial thing.
[34:06.600 --> 34:10.420]  You know what I like in a fruit salad, which I feel like isn't always in there enough,
[34:10.540 --> 34:13.720]  but it gets overshadowed and should shine a little bit more.
[34:13.860 --> 34:15.560]  I like a pear in a fruit salad.
[34:15.880 --> 34:16.760]  A pear can be great.
[34:17.280 --> 34:20.160]  I feel like a pear brings a whole other thing to the table in a fruit salad.
[34:20.340 --> 34:23.840]  I agree with that, but I would also say a pear on its own wouldn't ever buy that.
[34:25.040 --> 34:26.620]  You're never in the mood for a pear.
[34:27.740 --> 34:30.280]  I, you know, I feel like I agree with Geoff.
[34:30.360 --> 34:32.040]  I think the pear gets slept on.
[34:32.140 --> 34:34.540]  I think it's a better fruit than we give it credit for.
[34:34.960 --> 34:35.200]  Totally.
[34:35.260 --> 34:38.540]  I've heard people put some pear and a little bit, like,
[34:38.720 --> 34:40.940]  thinly slice some pear and put it on a grilled cheese.
[34:41.020 --> 34:42.040]  I think that would be interesting.
[34:42.360 --> 34:43.420]  I think that'd be a good combination.
[34:43.880 --> 34:44.920]  I've always wanted to try it.
[34:45.140 --> 34:45.800]  It sounds good.
[34:46.360 --> 34:47.160]  A little bit of texture.
[34:47.400 --> 34:48.860]  It's a good texture, unlike the banana.
[34:49.360 --> 34:50.040]  Terrible texture.
[34:50.100 --> 34:51.840]  Well, they're very different textures.
[34:51.900 --> 34:52.900]  Both great in their own right.
[34:52.900 --> 34:54.480]  But also controversial textures.
[34:54.620 --> 34:57.740]  A lot of people don't like pear purely because of the sandy texture.
[34:57.900 --> 34:59.060]  I think it's a strength, personally.
[34:59.780 --> 35:00.780]  Yeah, I see.
[35:00.820 --> 35:03.680]  I feel like the banana is grittier and chalkier than the pear.
[35:04.060 --> 35:05.920]  This chalk analogy with the banana.
[35:06.160 --> 35:07.420]  I don't know where you're getting that from.
[35:07.680 --> 35:12.280]  Yeah, I can't describe it either, but it's just it's how I it's how I remember.
[35:12.720 --> 35:14.660]  But to be fair, you guys are correct.
[35:14.920 --> 35:19.160]  I don't think I've just eaten a banana off the counter since I was maybe 10.
[35:19.720 --> 35:21.360]  It's probably been like 17 years.
[35:21.360 --> 35:22.740]  Go to the kitchen and get one.
[35:22.960 --> 35:23.680]  I don't have bananas.
[35:23.980 --> 35:24.740]  Why would I have bananas?
[35:24.740 --> 35:25.160]  Everyone has bananas.
[35:25.420 --> 35:26.340]  I don't have bananas.
[35:26.440 --> 35:27.260]  I don't like bananas.
[35:27.360 --> 35:28.240]  I never buy bananas.
[35:29.060 --> 35:30.580]  No one in your family has them?
[35:30.700 --> 35:32.660]  Go get a fucking apple, Gavin, right now.
[35:32.720 --> 35:33.560]  Everybody has apples.
[35:33.660 --> 35:35.200]  I got a dozen of them in my fridge.
[35:35.280 --> 35:35.980]  Go eat an apple.
[35:36.340 --> 35:37.540]  You keep apples in the fridge?
[35:37.880 --> 35:38.640]  Of course I do.
[35:39.220 --> 35:39.820]  Preserve them.
[35:40.020 --> 35:41.540]  You put them in the fruit crisper section.
[35:41.760 --> 35:42.520]  The drawer.
[35:42.680 --> 35:43.140]  You put them...
[35:43.740 --> 35:44.820]  No, it's too cold.
[35:45.020 --> 35:45.440]  You gotta be...
[35:45.440 --> 35:46.320]  No, it's not.
[35:46.420 --> 35:47.180]  No, it's not.
[35:47.240 --> 35:49.180]  It preserves them and maintains the crisp.
[35:49.680 --> 35:51.280]  I'm a room temperature apple guy.
[35:51.360 --> 35:52.680]  When I am an apple guy.
[35:52.780 --> 35:53.660]  What you're declaring is,
[35:53.760 --> 35:55.000]  I am a psychopath guy.
[35:55.080 --> 35:56.900]  Is what you're saying by saying that statement.
[35:57.200 --> 35:57.720]  You do not...
[35:57.720 --> 35:59.440]  Apples don't need to be refrigerated, man.
[35:59.680 --> 36:01.140]  They preserve better.
[36:01.500 --> 36:03.260]  Well, you don't buy as many.
[36:03.380 --> 36:05.540]  How long are you holding on to these apples?
[36:06.200 --> 36:08.560]  I'll buy like 12 apples and I'll just eat them.
[36:08.680 --> 36:09.640]  I'll eat them as I go.
[36:10.280 --> 36:12.920]  A Cosmic Crisp is gonna last you a fucking year.
[36:13.080 --> 36:13.780]  That's true.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.320]  So 12 apples will last you 12 months.
[36:16.720 --> 36:18.780]  I'm telling you, I will go down in the fridge
[36:18.780 --> 36:21.240]  and just go to town like a fucking horse.
[36:21.240 --> 36:22.140]  I will eat like...
[36:22.140 --> 36:22.980]  You'll go down to Apple Town?
[36:23.300 --> 36:24.860]  I will go to Apple Town.
[36:25.000 --> 36:25.860]  I love an apple.
[36:26.300 --> 36:27.200]  It's great.
[36:28.660 --> 36:30.520]  This might be a divisive opinion.
[36:30.760 --> 36:32.260]  Not an apple and peanut butter guy.
[36:32.760 --> 36:33.920]  Don't like those at all.
[36:34.580 --> 36:36.020]  I don't like that at all.
[36:36.600 --> 36:38.160]  I love both independently.
[36:38.660 --> 36:40.020]  It's a popular snack.
[36:40.320 --> 36:41.400]  Don't like them together.
[36:41.860 --> 36:42.640]  Whenever I do it,
[36:42.660 --> 36:44.580]  I end up just eating the peanut butter by itself
[36:44.580 --> 36:45.520]  and the apple by itself.
[36:45.700 --> 36:46.860]  Two great things in the pen.
[36:48.200 --> 36:51.720]  You sounded so legitimately angry when you went,
[36:51.940 --> 36:53.040]  I don't like it at all.
[36:53.240 --> 36:53.660]  At all.
[36:53.740 --> 36:55.180]  There was so much emphasis there.
[36:55.340 --> 36:56.180]  It's just genuine.
[36:56.400 --> 36:57.260]  It's a genuine dislike.
[36:57.280 --> 36:58.320]  What's your go-to apple?
[36:58.740 --> 36:59.720]  See, I don't want to say it
[36:59.720 --> 37:01.480]  because I don't want to put my apple on the spot.
[37:01.660 --> 37:02.420]  I do have one.
[37:02.500 --> 37:03.900]  If we're gonna rank them, I don't want you.
[37:04.160 --> 37:06.120]  You don't want to insult the Cosmic Crisp people.
[37:06.700 --> 37:07.980]  No, well, I've never had one.
[37:08.060 --> 37:10.560]  So it's very possible the Cosmic Crisp could be.
[37:10.600 --> 37:12.400]  I haven't had the joy of tasting it yet.
[37:12.880 --> 37:14.360]  I think my favorite apple,
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.160]  definitely the Granny Smith.
[37:16.160 --> 37:17.800]  It's a good, it's a great apple.
[37:17.900 --> 37:19.940]  The Granny Smith is a fantastic apple.
[37:20.140 --> 37:23.920]  I definitely, I put it in the top seven for sure of apple types.
[37:24.360 --> 37:24.940]  Top seven?
[37:25.240 --> 37:25.700]  Top seven.
[37:25.880 --> 37:26.280]  Seven.
[37:26.740 --> 37:29.120]  So there are potentially six apples you like better.
[37:29.360 --> 37:32.740]  How many apple types can you name off the top of your head?
[37:34.640 --> 37:37.220]  Not many, but I just, I hope seven.
[37:38.120 --> 37:39.020]  Nah, let's see.
[37:39.080 --> 37:40.800]  We got, I can name ones I hate.
[37:40.920 --> 37:43.580]  The fucking Macintosh is a trash bottom tier apple.
[37:45.020 --> 37:46.900]  I don't know if I want to reveal the other ones,
[37:46.980 --> 37:50.060]  because I feel like all the ones coming to mind right now are my greatest hits of apples,
[37:50.200 --> 37:51.520]  and I don't want to reveal my hand.
[37:51.620 --> 37:53.520]  I don't want to tip off in any way.
[37:53.540 --> 37:54.560]  Why don't you want to show your apple?
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.500]  Because I don't want Geoff to potentially be influenced or for either of you to be like,
[37:59.740 --> 38:03.900]  ah, shitty apple, like just to try to fucking get under my apple skin.
[38:03.920 --> 38:04.420]  Don't like it.
[38:04.420 --> 38:04.940]  He's right.
[38:05.140 --> 38:09.460]  He's right, because I absolutely will do that and was planning on doing it.
[38:09.560 --> 38:11.160]  No, it's a good call, Andrew.
[38:11.160 --> 38:14.080]  I'm going to keep keep your apples close to your vest.
[38:14.280 --> 38:14.960]  Yeah, I will.
[38:15.000 --> 38:16.440]  I'll keep them in my fridge, actually.
[38:16.540 --> 38:18.600]  So I'm going to keep them because it preserves the pointless.
[38:18.720 --> 38:20.340]  That's that's your remaining.
[38:20.460 --> 38:20.980]  That's ridiculous.
[38:21.340 --> 38:22.600]  You're just taking up fridge space.
[38:22.960 --> 38:24.640]  Could somebody look up either?
[38:24.900 --> 38:25.760]  Eric, could you look up?
[38:25.820 --> 38:27.420]  Should I be refrigerating my apples?
[38:27.840 --> 38:29.900]  They're not you don't buy them refrigerated.
[38:30.300 --> 38:30.880]  No, you don't.
[38:30.900 --> 38:35.560]  But like, I think it extends their their ripeness in the fridge in the store.
[38:35.840 --> 38:36.940]  Stick it in the fridge.
[38:37.520 --> 38:38.260]  General rule.
[38:38.620 --> 38:41.020]  I'm trying to think, is there an exception to that rule?
[38:41.760 --> 38:43.320]  Outside of fruit for me, bread.
[38:43.500 --> 38:44.800]  I put my bread in the fridge, too.
[38:45.240 --> 38:49.640]  Yes, there are items that say refrigerate upon opening.
[38:49.920 --> 38:52.540]  So like barbecue sauce, shit like that.
[38:52.740 --> 38:54.520]  You can buy it on the shelf.
[38:54.520 --> 38:56.680]  But then once you open, it has to be refrigerated.
[38:57.040 --> 39:01.140]  So, by the way, have we just talked about apples and bananas for free?
[39:01.940 --> 39:02.740]  We have.
[39:03.040 --> 39:07.040]  But also, with the last two episodes, I'm pretty apple heavy as well.
[39:07.780 --> 39:08.940]  God damn, man.
[39:09.040 --> 39:09.420]  You know what?
[39:09.420 --> 39:11.000]  I need to advise Eric.
[39:11.100 --> 39:12.860]  I'm going to do more research beyond this.
[39:12.960 --> 39:16.920]  But Eric sent the thing that says apples should be stored unrefrigerated for about seven days
[39:16.920 --> 39:17.600]  after purchase.
[39:17.880 --> 39:20.400]  Apples refrigerated too soon lose flavor and sweetness.
[39:20.660 --> 39:22.800]  Oh, that could be wrong.
[39:22.960 --> 39:26.340]  Cutting off your apples at the flavor knees for years.
[39:26.560 --> 39:26.860]  You know what?
[39:26.920 --> 39:27.320]  You know what?
[39:27.360 --> 39:31.140]  That though, that's a fucking statement about how delicious apples are.
[39:31.160 --> 39:34.660]  Because if I've been fucking chopping them at the knees for years and I still have them
[39:34.660 --> 39:37.040]  a nine out of ten, they're going to be fucking ten.
[39:37.040 --> 39:39.760]  You've been eating handicapped apples and they're still good.
[39:40.080 --> 39:44.980]  Yeah, they've been reduced quality apples and they're still top tier for me.
[39:45.040 --> 39:45.600]  It's an A plus.
[39:46.020 --> 39:46.540]  Top of the mountain.
[39:46.540 --> 39:47.700]  You know what you're about to do?
[39:47.860 --> 39:52.140]  You're about to, you're going to expand, your whole world is about to open up when you get
[39:52.140 --> 39:53.220]  a full flavored apple.
[39:53.780 --> 39:56.800]  Oh, it's going to be like seeing color for the first time, I assume.
[39:57.080 --> 39:57.580]  Yeah, congratulations.
[39:57.580 --> 39:58.360]  It's going to be life changing.
[39:58.980 --> 39:59.340]  I can't wait.
[39:59.340 --> 40:02.400]  I just feel like, storage aside, I just wouldn't want to bite into a cold apple.
[40:02.520 --> 40:05.340]  I feel like it'd be, it'd be like biting a lump of ice cream.
[40:05.460 --> 40:05.980]  It'd just be like, ugh.
[40:05.980 --> 40:08.180]  I don't, they don't get that cold.
[40:09.420 --> 40:10.060]  I don't know.
[40:10.140 --> 40:10.760]  I guess they're not frozen.
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  No, they're not frozen.
[40:12.220 --> 40:13.360]  That's a terrible comparison.
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.200]  Well, like a cold strawberry is too cold.
[40:17.660 --> 40:20.000]  Like, like if you get chocolate covered strawberries,
[40:20.560 --> 40:22.140]  need them out of the fridge for at least an hour.
[40:22.180 --> 40:24.160]  What about a frozen strawberry though?
[40:24.320 --> 40:24.880]  You're getting it.
[40:25.140 --> 40:26.700]  I feel like a frozen strawberry could be good.
[40:26.700 --> 40:28.580]  Dude, frozen strawberries are very good.
[40:29.020 --> 40:29.260]  See?
[40:29.560 --> 40:30.240]  I've been eating them.
[40:30.300 --> 40:30.880]  I've been eating them lately.
[40:31.220 --> 40:31.600]  Look at that.
[40:31.660 --> 40:35.300]  They sell them at, they sell like this little frozen strawberry thing at Trader Joe's.
[40:35.300 --> 40:35.980]  They're fucking yummy.
[40:36.560 --> 40:40.700]  Hey, do you guys think we should get off of fruit for a minute and switch gears?
[40:40.900 --> 40:41.700]  Or should we just, okay.
[40:41.800 --> 40:42.300]  That's fine.
[40:42.340 --> 40:42.820]  We could switch.
[40:43.040 --> 40:44.180]  Can I have a question?
[40:44.340 --> 40:45.940]  Like unrelated, just very quick.
[40:46.100 --> 40:47.560]  And I know it's something you want to talk about.
[40:47.880 --> 40:50.880]  And I apologize because it's possible we've already discussed it.
[40:51.240 --> 40:51.680]  And I forgot.
[40:52.160 --> 40:53.220]  But I don't think we have.
[40:53.440 --> 40:53.720]  This is Battenob related.
[40:54.200 --> 40:54.680]  No, no, no.
[40:54.700 --> 40:56.000]  It's not Battenob related at all.
[40:56.300 --> 40:56.500]  Okay.
[40:56.500 --> 40:57.240]  Has nothing to do with that.
[40:57.280 --> 40:58.600]  You're going to be excited when I bring this up.
[40:58.740 --> 41:00.800]  And I apologize if we've covered it and I just don't remember.
[41:01.380 --> 41:03.680]  You mentioned, I want to say last episode.
[41:03.680 --> 41:05.060]  Maybe it was two episodes ago.
[41:05.440 --> 41:07.480]  That you were really into like two things.
[41:07.480 --> 41:09.280]  That you're very excited about these things.
[41:09.660 --> 41:11.200]  And one of them was koozies.
[41:11.780 --> 41:12.940]  Yeah, koozies and pastrami.
[41:13.140 --> 41:13.960]  I'm a pastrami dude.
[41:14.040 --> 41:15.100]  I'm going to get pastrami this weekend.
[41:15.560 --> 41:18.080]  When I wake up early Saturday morning and get pastrami before F1.
[41:19.260 --> 41:21.640]  Dude, I was talking about it last night with my mom.
[41:21.720 --> 41:23.080]  My mom was in town and my aunt.
[41:23.640 --> 41:24.540]  And I went fucking...
[41:24.540 --> 41:26.660]  Dude, I spent like an hour talking to him about pastrami.
[41:26.800 --> 41:28.340]  Yeah, I get you really like pastrami.
[41:28.340 --> 41:29.540]  Mostly pastrami though, dude.
[41:30.020 --> 41:31.160]  I think that's wonderful.
[41:31.160 --> 41:33.940]  He's like, mom, mom, mom, pastrami.
[41:34.120 --> 41:34.980]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41:35.120 --> 41:38.020]  I was like, no, I was like, how did I get to be 46?
[41:38.420 --> 41:40.600]  And you never gave me pastrami?
[41:40.960 --> 41:42.340]  Like, what are you doing?
[41:42.980 --> 41:43.700]  But I...
[41:43.700 --> 41:46.160]  Why are you depriving me of pastrami for four decades?
[41:46.640 --> 41:49.000]  So much like last time, you brought up these two things.
[41:49.060 --> 41:52.500]  And I feel like I listened to you yell about pastrami for like 15 minutes.
[41:52.680 --> 41:53.440]  And which is awesome.
[41:53.960 --> 41:55.920]  I don't think I know why you like koozies.
[41:56.080 --> 41:57.380]  And why this is like a big thing.
[41:57.600 --> 41:58.920]  I don't think you ever explained that.
[41:59.360 --> 42:00.700]  Why are you super into koozies?
[42:02.720 --> 42:05.600]  Because my girlfriend gave me one.
[42:05.840 --> 42:07.800]  And it was the kind that lays flat.
[42:08.700 --> 42:09.620]  And I don't know.
[42:09.800 --> 42:10.840]  I just threw it on the counter.
[42:11.060 --> 42:12.460]  And one day I put it on a soda.
[42:12.680 --> 42:15.480]  And then I liked the heft of it.
[42:15.640 --> 42:18.840]  I liked how squishy it made my hand when I was drinking my soda.
[42:19.220 --> 42:20.460]  Kept my hand dry.
[42:20.840 --> 42:25.300]  I got to look at the logo of the thing that was on it and remind me that I was a fan of that thing.
[42:25.380 --> 42:27.580]  And it folded flat.
[42:27.800 --> 42:29.900]  And I was able to put it in my back pocket.
[42:29.900 --> 42:32.000]  And I liked the heft of having a koozie.
[42:32.080 --> 42:33.800]  It's like a little added packet.
[42:34.060 --> 42:36.840]  Like a little cushion for my butt.
[42:37.080 --> 42:38.700]  It's like the opposite of a back wallet.
[42:39.200 --> 42:42.800]  It's like you put a koozie in each pocket and you're sitting better.
[42:43.260 --> 42:43.500]  Okay.
[42:43.980 --> 42:45.780]  So you just really enjoyed the experience?
[42:46.700 --> 42:47.620]  Yeah, dude.
[42:47.740 --> 42:48.600]  Top to bottom.
[42:50.760 --> 42:52.740]  It's been like that lately with me.
[42:52.860 --> 42:55.020]  I've just been finding awesome new things that I didn't know about.
[42:55.280 --> 42:58.420]  Just today I was putting my headphones on to get ready for this podcast.
[42:58.420 --> 43:02.960]  And I remembered that when I got these headphones for Christmas three years ago,
[43:03.100 --> 43:04.360]  they were Bluetooth headphones.
[43:04.540 --> 43:06.120]  And I just never synced them up.
[43:06.180 --> 43:07.540]  And I was just using the cord the whole time.
[43:07.560 --> 43:09.200]  And I thought, I could do that.
[43:09.280 --> 43:10.480]  And I just wouldn't have a cord anymore.
[43:10.620 --> 43:14.160]  And I'm listening to you guys on cordless headphones now.
[43:14.340 --> 43:15.900]  It's just every day there's something better.
[43:16.040 --> 43:18.400]  Something new that's just like making my life easier.
[43:20.740 --> 43:23.640]  Pastrami, koozies, Bluetooth is great.
[43:23.840 --> 43:25.420]  I don't know if I trust Bluetooth with you.
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.760]  I feel like it's not so much now.
[43:27.760 --> 43:30.840]  I feel like there's a real phase of you, everything being broken.
[43:30.980 --> 43:31.900]  And I know I'm one to talk.
[43:32.000 --> 43:33.940]  I had my technical difficulties, too, for a stretch.
[43:34.320 --> 43:36.420]  But you with Bluetooth, like removing the cord.
[43:36.500 --> 43:37.780]  Do you know where the cord is at least?
[43:38.280 --> 43:39.480]  Yeah, I found it.
[43:39.560 --> 43:43.560]  I set it somewhere and three years ago and I found it immediately.
[43:43.720 --> 43:45.480]  I bet I put it here and it was there.
[43:46.000 --> 43:46.400]  Fantastic.
[43:46.900 --> 43:48.600]  That's great. I'm glad you're discovering new things.
[43:49.420 --> 43:52.240]  Should we talk about some of the other stuff we had planned?
[43:52.280 --> 43:55.260]  Because I just realized that we've been recording for like 43 minutes
[43:55.260 --> 43:57.000]  and we've only talked about apples.
[43:57.240 --> 43:58.840]  Essentially, we're we're about.
[43:58.980 --> 44:02.140]  So we had one, two, three, four, five, seven things on the list.
[44:02.180 --> 44:06.460]  And we've talked about kind of like, I guess two of them.
[44:06.620 --> 44:07.920]  Should we remove some of the apple stuff?
[44:07.960 --> 44:08.660]  Have we talked about anything?
[44:09.100 --> 44:09.480]  No, no.
[44:10.120 --> 44:11.340]  We've talked about a few things.
[44:11.520 --> 44:12.400]  Yeah, we have bananas.
[44:13.240 --> 44:14.300]  You want to just blow?
[44:14.920 --> 44:15.880]  Oh, yeah, chocolate.
[44:16.660 --> 44:18.160]  Let's yeah, let's mix things up.
[44:18.200 --> 44:18.960]  All right, let's switch gears.
[44:19.140 --> 44:20.520]  Andrew, you want to talk about nuggets?
[44:20.640 --> 44:21.660]  You have nugget content.
[44:22.140 --> 44:22.700]  Do OK.
[44:22.780 --> 44:24.420]  Are we just going to lean food heavy in this?
[44:24.420 --> 44:25.860]  We're just going to go full on.
[44:25.980 --> 44:28.120]  This is just sounds like a show at this point.
[44:28.380 --> 44:30.500]  I have I'm going to redeem.
[44:30.620 --> 44:32.080]  This is my redemption year.
[44:32.280 --> 44:37.220]  Gavin, as you know, this is this is a year of redemption for me.
[44:37.640 --> 44:39.680]  I've lost the burgers three times.
[44:39.760 --> 44:40.820]  I tried, did my best.
[44:41.020 --> 44:41.760]  Couldn't do it.
[44:42.560 --> 44:44.000]  I am now redeeming myself, though.
[44:44.060 --> 44:45.100]  Again, we're changing it up.
[44:45.140 --> 44:46.020]  We're going with nuggets.
[44:46.740 --> 44:47.540]  Oh, interesting.
[44:47.820 --> 44:48.680]  Oh, we're going.
[44:49.380 --> 44:50.440]  Nuggets are the future.
[44:50.740 --> 44:54.100]  And I will I will get my first before before you even go on.
[44:54.100 --> 44:56.420]  I just say up front that this is a terrible idea.
[44:56.580 --> 44:56.840]  Continue.
[44:57.120 --> 44:59.400]  OK, well, now let me explain the idea.
[44:59.640 --> 45:06.460]  This is I honestly I had this idea last year during the last game of this team's playoff run.
[45:06.520 --> 45:07.940]  They got eliminated the day after.
[45:08.040 --> 45:10.140]  So I've been sitting on this for a while.
[45:10.740 --> 45:13.720]  There is a basketball team called the Denver Nuggets.
[45:14.060 --> 45:16.560]  I want to outnugget the Nuggets.
[45:16.760 --> 45:22.440]  I want to eat more Nuggets than the Nuggets score points in a game and embarrass their franchise.
[45:23.070 --> 45:24.120]  So I'm planning this.
[45:24.540 --> 45:26.480]  We're doing this on what day is it?
[45:26.540 --> 45:30.520]  I I'm going to do the it's the Friday, October 29th.
[45:30.580 --> 45:34.700]  They have a 7 p.m. Pacific game against the Dallas Mavericks at the Nuggets home.
[45:35.200 --> 45:39.680]  I will eat more Nuggets within the regulation of the game than the Nuggets score points.
[45:40.160 --> 45:41.480]  I'm very confident about this.
[45:41.920 --> 45:45.740]  What if you were to pick a team with a better defense like the Utah Jazz,
[45:46.040 --> 45:48.320]  like a team that's going to lock down the Nuggets?
[45:48.880 --> 45:54.220]  There's a 20 Nuggets swing going here, probably, depending on which team you pick.
[45:54.520 --> 45:56.100]  I'm not worried about that at all, Geoff.
[45:56.580 --> 45:59.240]  Much like the chocolate, I don't think this will be an issue.
[45:59.840 --> 46:02.380]  I got Nugget confidence for this.
[46:03.560 --> 46:06.880]  What's the average score in a basketball game?
[46:07.060 --> 46:07.980]  That's a great question.
[46:08.660 --> 46:15.480]  Beyond the average score, the Denver Nuggets averaged 115.5 points per game last season.
[46:15.960 --> 46:16.960]  That was their average score.
[46:16.960 --> 46:19.160]  So we're looking at 116.
[46:20.500 --> 46:21.560]  It's a weird sport.
[46:22.880 --> 46:25.660]  So are you going to get like... how many are you going to buy?
[46:25.740 --> 46:26.980]  You're going to have them all up front, right?
[46:27.020 --> 46:30.760]  I'm assuming... no, this is... so that's another fantastic question by you.
[46:31.000 --> 46:32.000]  It doesn't make sense.
[46:32.080 --> 46:36.020]  I should not be able to score points while the Nuggets have the ball.
[46:36.200 --> 46:39.760]  So I can only eat the Nuggets when Dallas has the ball.
[46:40.040 --> 46:41.040]  It's the only time.
[46:41.080 --> 46:44.040]  I can only gain points on them when Dallas has possession.
[46:44.360 --> 46:46.220]  I cannot just be eating Nuggets constantly.
[46:46.220 --> 46:48.740]  I'm only allowed to score when Dallas has the ball.
[46:50.220 --> 46:52.840]  So in a two-hour basketball game,
[46:53.020 --> 46:56.760]  you only have access to approximately one hour of Nugget-eating time.
[46:57.060 --> 46:59.120]  Potentially. We'll see how the game flow goes.
[46:59.240 --> 47:02.360]  But yeah, I'm expecting and anticipating having to eat 116.
[47:02.680 --> 47:04.080]  Here's a question for you.
[47:04.100 --> 47:04.360]  Yes.
[47:05.580 --> 47:07.900]  Is this a nationally televised game?
[47:08.240 --> 47:10.380]  I have no idea. I'm assuming so, but I don't know.
[47:10.600 --> 47:15.000]  Well, if it's a nationally televised game, there'll be a halftime show?
[47:15.000 --> 47:16.960]  Will you be able to eat during the halftime show?
[47:17.140 --> 47:20.120]  Like, say, maybe during Nuggets highlights or something?
[47:20.420 --> 47:22.120]  Or like during Dallas highlights?
[47:22.340 --> 47:23.300]  Okay, so just during...
[47:23.300 --> 47:25.540]  What if it's out of bounds? What if it's like between stuff?
[47:26.000 --> 47:27.240]  What do you mean, when it's out of bounds?
[47:27.980 --> 47:32.120]  Okay, so if Dallas loses the ball out of bounds, I immediately have to stop.
[47:32.820 --> 47:34.560]  But the ball has to be in play?
[47:35.000 --> 47:36.480]  The ball has to be in play.
[47:36.620 --> 47:37.680]  That's even less time.
[47:37.800 --> 47:41.240]  What about during a timeout called by Dallas and they maintain possession?
[47:41.240 --> 47:45.840]  Nah, I can't score. If the team can't score points, then I can't score points.
[47:45.980 --> 47:48.720]  Okay, so they score three points, let's say.
[47:49.120 --> 47:49.320]  Yeah.
[47:49.760 --> 47:52.640]  Then the ball goes to the other team.
[47:53.140 --> 47:53.540]  Right.
[47:54.360 --> 47:55.300]  You're explaining basketball.
[47:56.360 --> 47:57.260]  I'm just trying to imagine.
[47:57.440 --> 47:59.700]  So are you then going to immediately be stuffing your face?
[48:00.220 --> 48:02.880]  As soon as Dallas gets possession of the ball, I gotta go.
[48:02.960 --> 48:03.920]  I gotta go, go, go, go, go.
[48:04.140 --> 48:06.520]  I'll be like fucking Geoff's vacation guide.
[48:06.620 --> 48:09.000]  It's going to be a go-now scenario of chew those Nuggets.
[48:09.000 --> 48:09.720]  He's going to go now.
[48:09.720 --> 48:16.440]  So are you competing in this scenario against Dallas or the Nuggets or both?
[48:17.460 --> 48:19.700]  Dallas is a representation of me.
[48:20.260 --> 48:21.200]  Yeah, he is Dallas.
[48:21.600 --> 48:23.620]  Yeah, you are Dallas in this scenario.
[48:23.960 --> 48:28.000]  Going against the Denver Nuggets, I'm going to out Nugget the Nuggets.
[48:28.200 --> 48:29.060]  It's going to be great.
[48:29.620 --> 48:32.800]  And are you going to get any sauce involved?
[48:33.120 --> 48:36.380]  See, now this is a very interesting thing that I wanted to bring up.
[48:36.380 --> 48:40.160]  And Nick even also asked, what is the Nugget to point ratio?
[48:40.200 --> 48:43.460]  Because in basketball, you're typically your average score is worth two points.
[48:43.460 --> 48:44.620]  And there's a three-point play.
[48:45.040 --> 48:45.940]  Free throw is worth one.
[48:46.360 --> 48:47.880]  I am in my head.
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.700]  I always assumed one Nugget equaled one point, the equivalent of one point.
[48:52.300 --> 48:56.300]  But I am open to the idea of like a three-point Nugget.
[48:56.600 --> 48:58.060]  But I just don't know what that looks.
[48:58.140 --> 49:01.520]  I don't know if that's like if I have to dip it in insanely hot hot sauce.
[49:01.680 --> 49:03.700]  If that's the three-point Nugget, like what?
[49:04.060 --> 49:05.060]  What would I have to do?
[49:05.060 --> 49:10.440]  Obviously, it has to be a tougher experience to replicate the equivalent of a three-point Nugget.
[49:10.560 --> 49:11.760]  How about a three-point?
[49:13.200 --> 49:13.740]  Go ahead.
[49:13.840 --> 49:14.340]  Go ahead, Gav.
[49:16.580 --> 49:17.380]  How about...
[49:17.380 --> 49:17.760]  All right, I'll go.
[49:18.060 --> 49:18.580]  How about...
[49:19.380 --> 49:20.580]  You know, you know, that's...
[49:20.580 --> 49:25.160]  We very rarely have that shit happen, considering we're an audio-only podcast that records remotely.
[49:25.480 --> 49:27.220]  It's pretty impressive.
[49:27.380 --> 49:28.620]  It's way worse on the other ones I do.
[49:29.360 --> 49:30.600]  What if you just like...
[49:30.600 --> 49:33.820]  I like the one-to-one ratio because it makes the most sense for math.
[49:33.820 --> 49:37.120]  And you're not having to do any kind of translation or figuring shit out on the fly.
[49:37.520 --> 49:38.760]  So what if for a three-point Nugget,
[49:38.820 --> 49:41.400]  you just had to put all three Nuggets in your mouth at the same time?
[49:41.520 --> 49:42.940]  No, I don't see...
[49:42.940 --> 49:44.340]  I think it could be...
[49:45.020 --> 49:46.440]  I agree, like...
[49:46.960 --> 49:49.300]  I'm very mixed because I'm not...
[49:49.300 --> 49:51.260]  I can't tolerate hot sauce at all.
[49:51.580 --> 49:53.860]  So if we get a super hot hot sauce, if it...
[49:53.860 --> 49:59.700]  It would genuinely be a desperation move by me if I was trailing in points in the last thing.
[49:59.940 --> 50:01.400]  And I think that could be funny.
[50:01.800 --> 50:02.840]  Yeah, but here's the deal.
[50:02.840 --> 50:05.060]  Here's what I see happening down the road.
[50:05.480 --> 50:11.300]  You fail the challenge and you blame the hot sauce, not the Nugget's quantity.
[50:11.700 --> 50:13.520]  Which is what we're going to disagree with.
[50:13.580 --> 50:15.900]  Because we're going to think that the quantity of Nuggets is overwhelming.
[50:16.500 --> 50:17.280]  You're going to...
[50:17.280 --> 50:20.540]  When you fail at this, inevitably, you're going to blame other things.
[50:20.580 --> 50:22.560]  Like hot sauce being too much for you to handle.
[50:22.840 --> 50:24.120]  But it's really going to be the Nuggets.
[50:24.180 --> 50:25.340]  I'd like to eliminate...
[50:25.340 --> 50:28.420]  This competition is you versus the Nuggets, Nugget to Nugget.
[50:28.820 --> 50:30.840]  I think it should be simple.
[50:30.840 --> 50:32.260]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[50:32.280 --> 50:34.580]  I'm very excited for this to take place.
[50:34.800 --> 50:35.460]  I'm just also...
[50:35.460 --> 50:39.100]  Like, as I'm asking questions, I'm also thinking about how he's going to Andrew Panton this.
[50:39.200 --> 50:41.380]  Like, how's he going to salad cream slash pretzels?
[50:42.020 --> 50:42.920]  No, I think...
[50:42.920 --> 50:45.860]  Honestly, I disagree with your analysis that I blame the sauce.
[50:45.960 --> 50:47.060]  I'd be like, I could have eaten the Nugget.
[50:47.200 --> 50:51.300]  I would only go to that sauce if I felt like I couldn't...
[50:51.300 --> 50:52.580]  I was running out of time.
[50:52.620 --> 50:53.680]  And that I just was like...
[50:53.680 --> 50:54.220]  I was fucked.
[50:54.800 --> 50:57.340]  It would be most likely in my head, not a time issue, actually.
[50:57.420 --> 50:58.740]  As much as it is a...
[50:58.740 --> 51:00.240]  I can't eat this many Nuggets.
[51:00.240 --> 51:03.220]  I'm going to need to start getting bonus Nuggets off of every Nugget.
[51:03.600 --> 51:07.620]  That's when I would pivot to the sauce in my head.
[51:07.720 --> 51:09.240]  So I don't think I'd ever excuse that.
[51:09.340 --> 51:10.740]  But I agree with what you said.
[51:10.800 --> 51:13.300]  I like the integrity of a Nugget being one point.
[51:13.500 --> 51:15.580]  I think that's truly outnuggeting the Nuggets.
[51:15.680 --> 51:18.280]  If I eat genuinely more Nuggets, then they score points.
[51:18.820 --> 51:19.540]  I agree with that.
[51:19.780 --> 51:20.540]  Hey, Gav?
[51:20.920 --> 51:21.160]  Yeah?
[51:21.540 --> 51:23.580]  What Nugget count do you think he throws in the towel?
[51:24.180 --> 51:25.700]  Well, I'm trying to think of how many...
[51:25.700 --> 51:28.500]  Because I find Nuggets get extremely samey.
[51:28.500 --> 51:31.140]  After I've had like five, I'm just like, I'm done with them.
[51:32.020 --> 51:35.200]  I think around 60, he's going to be really feeling it.
[51:35.400 --> 51:36.900]  I was going to say 72.
[51:37.120 --> 51:38.660]  He's going to tap out at 72 Nuggets.
[51:39.120 --> 51:39.520]  72?
[51:40.400 --> 51:41.040]  We'll see.
[51:41.180 --> 51:43.120]  I bet you every time...
[51:43.120 --> 51:45.680]  The first time I did the burger challenge, I was so confident.
[51:45.880 --> 51:48.600]  And I literally realized my issues one bite in.
[51:49.020 --> 51:52.300]  So I'm curious to see if I hit that wall.
[51:52.500 --> 51:54.020]  And if at what point with the...
[51:54.020 --> 51:56.540]  Well, how many bites of burger do you think you got down?
[51:57.100 --> 51:57.600]  What do you mean?
[51:57.800 --> 51:58.420]  On which one?
[51:58.420 --> 51:59.100]  On which attempt?
[51:59.780 --> 52:00.600]  Your best attempt.
[52:00.960 --> 52:01.680]  My best attempt?
[52:01.920 --> 52:03.340]  I ate like 42 burgers.
[52:04.060 --> 52:04.900]  How many bites was that?
[52:05.360 --> 52:07.780]  I don't know how to translate burger to bite.
[52:08.200 --> 52:08.460]  What do you mean?
[52:08.540 --> 52:10.080]  Were you doing like five bites per burger?
[52:10.520 --> 52:13.880]  I have never measured in bites per burger before.
[52:14.040 --> 52:14.880]  So I have no idea.
[52:15.660 --> 52:16.620]  What's a Nugget to you?
[52:16.620 --> 52:17.200]  Are you all in?
[52:17.720 --> 52:18.320]  I could...
[52:18.320 --> 52:19.160]  Well, like, what do you mean?
[52:19.220 --> 52:19.780]  Like how many...
[52:21.520 --> 52:22.940]  Are you doing two chomps per Nugget?
[52:23.020 --> 52:23.740]  Or are you just stuffing them in?
[52:23.920 --> 52:24.960]  A Nugget's two bites.
[52:25.040 --> 52:25.920]  I don't know.
[52:26.280 --> 52:26.740]  I could...
[52:26.740 --> 52:28.680]  No, I think it's more than two bites.
[52:28.800 --> 52:32.120]  I mean, I could throw the whole Nugget in my mouth just as a whole.
[52:32.340 --> 52:34.780]  But it's like, how many times does it take the chew to swallow?
[52:34.900 --> 52:35.400]  I don't know.
[52:35.840 --> 52:36.960]  I've never considered that.
[52:37.140 --> 52:38.500]  I'm not worried about how many times it's...
[52:38.500 --> 52:38.880]  I'm just...
[52:38.880 --> 52:40.980]  Yeah, how many chomps of the actual Nug to get all in?
[52:40.980 --> 52:41.540]  Yeah, how many bites?
[52:41.680 --> 52:44.440]  But I feel like if you do put the entire thing in, you're going to get less sauce,
[52:44.520 --> 52:45.440]  which might be a bonus.
[52:45.720 --> 52:48.360]  See, I don't know if I'll use sauce because that could take up space.
[52:48.820 --> 52:50.000]  It's my whole thing with the sauce.
[52:50.140 --> 52:52.800]  It's also like, we're not even talking about the fact of
[52:53.360 --> 52:54.740]  maintaining temperature on the Nuggets.
[52:54.740 --> 52:57.400]  How many Nuggets do I order at one time?
[52:57.840 --> 52:59.540]  Yeah, I was about to say, can I make a recommendation?
[53:00.240 --> 53:03.240]  They're going to get harder to eat the more room temperature they become.
[53:03.580 --> 53:06.760]  If I were you, I would order them via competing services
[53:06.760 --> 53:12.180]  in a tiered manner so that they're arriving hot like every 30 minutes or something.
[53:12.440 --> 53:15.520]  So I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to order 60 up front
[53:15.520 --> 53:17.140]  and I'm going to go all McDonald's Nuggets.
[53:17.300 --> 53:21.640]  I'm going to go 60 McDonald's Nuggets and then order another 60 as soon as half starts.
[53:22.200 --> 53:22.420]  OK.
[53:22.420 --> 53:23.560]  Because that could be another.
[53:23.860 --> 53:25.660]  That would be honestly how I age a pant in it.
[53:25.800 --> 53:28.040]  If I run out of Nuggets, that would be the.
[53:28.540 --> 53:31.500]  Yeah, you know, you don't want your Nuggets stuck in traffic.
[53:31.940 --> 53:32.540]  No, I don't.
[53:33.280 --> 53:34.080]  It was a good point.
[53:34.220 --> 53:34.540]  Terrible.
[53:34.640 --> 53:35.260]  Yeah, just watching.
[53:35.400 --> 53:36.760]  So it's like, how long is a halftime?
[53:36.820 --> 53:38.140]  Like 15 minutes, 10 minutes.
[53:38.140 --> 53:40.660]  Like, I need to factor that into of ordering.
[53:40.880 --> 53:42.280]  You have to time that perfectly.
[53:42.700 --> 53:43.060]  I do.
[53:43.460 --> 53:46.940]  Because you don't want to be running around barefoot outside when the game's on.
[53:47.500 --> 53:48.540]  No, pick up your next Nug.
[53:48.760 --> 53:49.380]  Absolutely not.
[53:49.520 --> 53:50.440]  Nothing is worse.
[53:50.440 --> 53:51.160]  Oh, fuck.
[53:51.180 --> 53:54.300]  And it's going to be it's going to be dark outside at that point.
[53:54.340 --> 53:55.920]  It starts at 7 in the morning.
[53:56.220 --> 53:58.080]  That's a whole other layer.
[53:58.200 --> 54:02.100]  Why don't you get the second batch just in the oven on like a low preheat?
[54:02.240 --> 54:03.560]  I feel like that'll dry them out.
[54:03.740 --> 54:04.880]  I feel like that might dry them out.
[54:05.580 --> 54:06.260]  That's my concern.
[54:06.540 --> 54:07.660]  Maybe not if you cover it.
[54:08.160 --> 54:13.260]  OK, well, you know, I honestly I'll probably I'll make sure I have enough Nuggets.
[54:13.360 --> 54:16.380]  We're going to I'm going to crush the Denver Nuggets is all I'm saying.
[54:16.400 --> 54:18.060]  I don't think I could go past 30.
[54:18.080 --> 54:19.700]  I predict 60 for Andrew.
[54:19.700 --> 54:21.560]  I don't think he's going to get over 100.
[54:21.860 --> 54:22.680]  I could do 40.
[54:22.820 --> 54:23.020]  No way.
[54:23.220 --> 54:24.240]  He'll get 72.
[54:24.420 --> 54:24.600]  How?
[54:25.380 --> 54:26.300]  I'm sorry, Andrew.
[54:26.400 --> 54:27.160]  What day is this again?
[54:27.520 --> 54:29.620]  October 29th, 7 p.m.
[54:30.120 --> 54:31.060]  That's pretty soon.
[54:31.240 --> 54:31.880]  That's pretty exciting.
[54:32.300 --> 54:32.760]  It is.
[54:33.020 --> 54:34.120]  It's nine days from now.
[54:34.620 --> 54:35.280]  Oh, man.
[54:37.440 --> 54:40.580]  So we're probably getting fairly close to the end.
[54:40.700 --> 54:43.040]  I wanted to mention I had this idea.
[54:43.140 --> 54:46.600]  I posed to the Facebook Slack the other day and everybody seemed to like it.
[54:46.640 --> 54:48.600]  So I was going to bring it up here and pose it to the audience.
[54:48.600 --> 54:53.360]  It struck me that we should probably create some sort of a regulation f*** face shirt.
[54:53.540 --> 54:54.860]  I just don't know what that would be.
[54:55.420 --> 54:57.820]  Oh, it should just say regulation shirt on it, shouldn't it?
[54:57.860 --> 55:00.980]  Should it just say regulation f*** face shirt like on the breast or something?
[55:01.360 --> 55:03.600]  Does it even need to say the name of the show?
[55:03.720 --> 55:06.680]  I think it might just say regulation shirt.
[55:07.080 --> 55:07.820]  Regulation shirt?
[55:07.940 --> 55:08.320]  Okay.
[55:08.800 --> 55:09.280]  I like that.
[55:09.440 --> 55:10.560]  Just on the on the pocket?
[55:11.460 --> 55:12.420]  Or is it even a pocket tee?
[55:12.420 --> 55:12.820]  I don't know.
[55:12.920 --> 55:15.980]  I feel like it's just a cross and like kind of bigger letters.
[55:16.280 --> 55:17.060]  Regulation shirt.
[55:17.620 --> 55:19.920]  What color is the shirt?
[55:20.400 --> 55:21.680]  What's a regulation color?
[55:22.120 --> 55:23.800]  In my head, it's black with a white font.
[55:23.900 --> 55:26.040]  But I'd like that isn't as important to me.
[55:26.400 --> 55:27.980]  In my head, it was the other way around.
[55:28.040 --> 55:29.160]  It was white with a black font.
[55:29.400 --> 55:30.820]  I'm fine with either of this.
[55:31.220 --> 55:32.580]  I think one of each.
[55:33.320 --> 55:33.860]  Do multiples?
[55:34.600 --> 55:37.300]  Eric, can you can you investigate that for us?
[55:37.460 --> 55:40.180]  And Geoff, could you put a sticker on every one of these shirts, please?
[55:40.840 --> 55:41.320]  Can we sell?
[55:41.680 --> 55:43.480]  Depends on how many we sell.
[55:44.120 --> 55:45.140]  Potentially, sure.
[55:46.620 --> 55:50.800]  Have you worked more on the bat hitting, signing your name on balls with a bat thing?
[55:51.260 --> 55:53.500]  Well, no, because I've been in Florida the whole time.
[55:53.940 --> 55:57.360]  And then I got home right as my mom and my aunt got here.
[55:57.440 --> 55:58.480]  So I spent the weekend with them.
[55:59.260 --> 56:03.280]  And also, the audience is going to be pissed off next episode because I won't have hit the
[56:03.280 --> 56:07.360]  ball or throw the ball by then either, because we're about to record it in eight seconds.
[56:08.320 --> 56:09.880]  I apologize for that.
[56:11.220 --> 56:14.480]  But no, listen, I'm going to fucking I'm going to hit a thousand baseballs.
[56:14.480 --> 56:15.480]  We just got to get them made.
[56:15.700 --> 56:16.660]  I feel extra.
[56:16.800 --> 56:22.400]  I have some extreme, extreme baseball bat confidence on the thousand.
[56:23.340 --> 56:28.780]  I have I have B plus confidence on the baseball throw.
[56:29.080 --> 56:33.700]  I will admit that my body has been frustrating me and a little bit here and there, but I don't
[56:33.700 --> 56:35.800]  think it'll impede me swinging the bat a thousand times.
[56:35.920 --> 56:38.200]  It's definitely going to cause some issues with throwing the ball.
[56:38.440 --> 56:38.900]  But that's OK.
[56:39.180 --> 56:39.680]  That's OK.
[56:39.920 --> 56:40.860]  We'll figure it out.
[56:41.120 --> 56:41.400]  Right.
[56:41.940 --> 56:43.000]  What's the worst that can happen?
[56:43.000 --> 56:43.520]  Honest.
[56:43.680 --> 56:47.980]  OK, so just a quick on a scale of one to 100, Geoff, how confident are you that you could
[56:47.980 --> 56:49.960]  swing at a thousand baseballs in one thing?
[56:50.120 --> 56:50.480]  One hundred.
[56:51.060 --> 56:51.960]  One hundred percent confidence.
[56:52.460 --> 56:54.860]  I am one hundred percent confident I could do the nugget thing.
[56:55.240 --> 56:59.260]  Now, Gavin, you rank the likelihood of each of those things actually happening, being
[56:59.260 --> 56:59.760]  successful.
[57:01.960 --> 57:03.660]  In what format am I ranking?
[57:03.920 --> 57:05.620]  Like percent one, one to one hundred.
[57:05.700 --> 57:05.880]  Yeah.
[57:06.100 --> 57:06.960]  Percentage confident.
[57:07.260 --> 57:09.940]  The odds of them actually being completed.
[57:10.780 --> 57:11.920]  What we're claiming will happen.
[57:11.920 --> 57:14.780]  Your nugs at 40 percent confidence.
[57:15.140 --> 57:16.260]  OK, that's pretty good.
[57:16.480 --> 57:17.760]  It's higher than I put.
[57:17.860 --> 57:21.920]  I put Geoff hitting a thousand balls at 20.
[57:22.620 --> 57:23.500]  Now, what if it was swinging?
[57:23.600 --> 57:24.680]  It's not necessarily hitting.
[57:25.200 --> 57:26.540]  He's swinging at a thousand.
[57:27.220 --> 57:27.740]  Twenty five.
[57:28.160 --> 57:29.200]  OK, there you go.
[57:29.720 --> 57:30.820]  See what I just did for you, Geoff?
[57:31.500 --> 57:32.360]  It's got you five points.
[57:32.600 --> 57:35.520]  OK, well, well, now you've now you've motivated me to crush.
[57:35.720 --> 57:36.120]  Got it.
[57:36.180 --> 57:36.460]  Thank you.
[57:36.500 --> 57:41.820]  And I would put my confidence in eating an entire chocolate bar at zero.
[57:41.920 --> 57:45.500]  If I put that at a thousand percent for me, I can't wait.
[57:45.560 --> 57:46.620]  Next one, I can't get it delivered.
[57:47.340 --> 57:49.140]  I would put that even lower than your nugs.
[57:49.520 --> 57:51.280]  Oh, that is outrageous.
[57:51.540 --> 57:52.660]  I don't like dark chocolate.
[57:52.860 --> 57:53.560]  I'm very excited.
[57:54.080 --> 57:54.420]  Next.
[57:54.680 --> 57:56.060]  I guess we're doing this next week.
[57:56.100 --> 57:57.120]  We're about to record a second one.
[57:57.180 --> 57:57.980]  The one after that one.
[57:58.240 --> 57:59.280]  I mean, some fucking chocolate.
[57:59.500 --> 58:00.200]  It's going to go great.
[58:00.400 --> 58:01.860]  I'm also going to post nuggets.
[58:02.880 --> 58:03.820]  Yeah, that's true.
[58:03.980 --> 58:05.420]  Listen, I'm jazzed.
[58:05.800 --> 58:07.360]  I'm really jazzed about this.
[58:07.420 --> 58:11.060]  This next this the one after the one we're about to record, because it's going to have a lot of
[58:11.060 --> 58:14.340]  it's going to have what I'm guessing are going to be some classic face bits in it.
[58:15.000 --> 58:16.200]  Realized after all this.
[58:16.620 --> 58:21.780]  But let's not sleep on next episode, because next episode, I think we're going to get to the superhero thing.
[58:22.160 --> 58:22.640]  Finally.
[58:22.760 --> 58:22.940]  Yep.
[58:23.180 --> 58:26.300]  And also, I want to pitch to you guys.
[58:26.540 --> 58:33.380]  I sent you guys some texts while I was in Florida about some ideas I had for some revolutionary new products.
[58:33.840 --> 58:39.260]  Similar within the same vein of a two spicy icy and a beef bracelet.
[58:39.260 --> 58:43.420]  Maybe the next evolution in that lineage brought well brought to us by Uniform.
[58:43.640 --> 58:46.040]  Uniform, combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm.
[58:46.240 --> 58:46.500]  Uniform.
[58:46.840 --> 58:47.100]  Yes.
[58:51.760 --> 58:53.380]  Speaking of which, Uniform.
[58:53.720 --> 58:54.100]  Uniform.
[58:56.160 --> 58:56.580]  Uniform.
[58:57.740 --> 58:59.860]  Combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm.
[59:00.120 --> 59:00.320]  Uniform.
[59:01.500 --> 59:04.800]  We might even have a spinoff show that is related.
[59:05.020 --> 59:05.520]  U-N-I-F-R-A-M.
[59:08.080 --> 59:08.940]  F-R-A-M.
[59:09.560 --> 59:09.920]  Unifram.
[59:12.620 --> 59:18.840]  Anyway, we might have a Unifram-esque spinoff video show that we might be producing soon,
[59:18.920 --> 59:19.900]  which I'm pretty excited about, too.
[59:20.340 --> 59:20.680]  Oh, yeah.
[59:21.020 --> 59:23.680]  But we can get into all that in the future.
[59:24.300 --> 59:27.200]  And by future, do you mean like we're ending the show now and then going to talk about it?
[59:27.720 --> 59:32.380]  I think like we should probably end this one and then hit stop and save and then hit record and
[59:32.380 --> 59:33.820]  then immediately get into it.
[59:34.120 --> 59:34.660]  Okay, well.
[59:35.220 --> 59:35.580]  All right.
[59:35.620 --> 59:36.940]  I'm going to stick a P in as well.
[59:37.000 --> 59:37.820]  I got one thing.
[59:38.280 --> 59:39.120]  I'd like to P as well.
[59:39.820 --> 59:40.180]  Stop.
[59:40.460 --> 59:41.340]  Just end the episode.
[59:41.700 --> 59:41.800]  Why?
[59:41.980 --> 59:43.200]  You don't need one more thing.
[59:43.660 --> 59:44.740]  Andrew's still talking.
[59:46.000 --> 59:46.760]  No, it's not.
[59:47.100 --> 59:50.360]  I'm just going to say I have something to bring up unrelated to that in the next episode.
[59:50.840 --> 59:51.080]  Okay.
[59:51.300 --> 59:51.960]  Oh, what is it?
[59:52.320 --> 59:53.620]  I talked to you about it yesterday.
[59:53.900 --> 59:55.380]  I'm very excited to hear Gavin's reaction.
[59:55.480 --> 59:56.240]  What's going on?
[59:56.340 --> 59:57.160]  End this.
[59:59.380 --> 59:59.840]  All right.
[59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.120]  Well, I'm really excited to hear about it.
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:01.740]  Hit stop.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:02.500]  Everyone hit stop.
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:02.860]  Goodbye.
[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:03.540]  Thanks for listening.
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.160]  Are you aware that we did one?
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:07.560]  We did a one hour, 17 minute episode.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.140]  I know.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:10.460]  I know.
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:11.420]  Just...
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:12.540]  Oh, Henry's here with the ball.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:12.880]  Yeah.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:13.280]  All right.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:13.640]  Cut.
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:14.620]  Cut.
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:15.620]  Hit stop now.
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:17.660]  We didn't have an outro.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.420]  There was no outro.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.040]  There was no intro.
