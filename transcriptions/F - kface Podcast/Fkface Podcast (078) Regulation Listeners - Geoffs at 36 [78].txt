[00:36.040 --> 00:39.720]  Hello and welcome to episode 78 of the Face podcast.
[00:40.280 --> 00:41.260]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:41.260 --> 00:42.840]  My audio sounds good, according to Nick.
[00:42.900 --> 00:46.040]  We had to do some tests earlier because I had some weird device manager problems.
[00:46.360 --> 00:49.640]  Thanks, Nick. With me as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Frey.
[00:50.120 --> 00:53.440]  This episode and the next one, because we're doing back to backs, it's going to be a
[00:53.440 --> 00:54.860]  little weird. And I'll tell you why.
[00:55.180 --> 00:56.500]  We didn't record last week.
[00:56.860 --> 01:00.060]  Whenever we skip a week, the notes pile up.
[01:00.580 --> 01:04.040]  Yeah, I have more notes in my phone, I think, than I've ever had.
[01:04.100 --> 01:07.920]  I went through them last night with Emily and she was like, holy shit, I thought you
[01:07.920 --> 01:09.900]  were kidding. That is like that is way too much to talk about.
[01:09.900 --> 01:13.040]  And some stuff is time sensitive, so it's slipping away.
[01:13.140 --> 01:16.600]  But on top of that, the degree of difficulty, Andrew, I don't know if you want to talk
[01:16.600 --> 01:18.540]  about it. We couldn't film last week because you were ill.
[01:18.720 --> 01:19.980]  You're feeling better now.
[01:20.600 --> 01:22.880]  I, however, am not feeling great.
[01:23.080 --> 01:26.320]  Oh, no. Well, it's it's not I'm not sick.
[01:26.340 --> 01:32.600]  It's that I have a colonoscopy tomorrow scheduled and I'm in the middle of colonoscopy
[01:32.600 --> 01:38.880]  prep. So I haven't eaten in a couple of days and I'm I'm living off of a clear I'm
[01:38.880 --> 01:42.880]  living off of white Gatorade and and water.
[01:43.060 --> 01:44.700]  Right. Is that why you weren't at the office earlier?
[01:45.080 --> 01:49.000]  Yeah, I couldn't. Well, I was going to come in and record with y'all, play a video
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.840]  game with y'all. But yeah, I got to drink a bunch of weird shit, Nick.
[01:51.880 --> 01:53.020]  I'm in the middle of drinking the weird shit.
[01:53.460 --> 01:56.800]  But at that specific time, this is the other reason why it's going to be interesting.
[01:57.400 --> 02:00.500]  I don't think I've gone 15 minutes without shitting my brains out today.
[02:00.620 --> 02:08.420]  Really? So so I tried to my damnedest to like explode everything I could out of me
[02:08.420 --> 02:13.420]  before the recording, but I might have to I might have to leave for a little bit to
[02:13.420 --> 02:15.720]  shoot water violently out of my ass.
[02:16.960 --> 02:18.560]  I will. At some point.
[02:18.680 --> 02:22.180]  There's one podcast that is established recording in a bathroom.
[02:22.280 --> 02:25.420]  You've already done this. This is this is round two for you.
[02:25.520 --> 02:28.840]  I don't know how to get the mic in there, but God damn, dude.
[02:28.900 --> 02:33.600]  I woke up at about three this morning, ran to the bathroom, and I don't think I left
[02:33.600 --> 02:34.620]  until five thirty.
[02:34.940 --> 02:40.120]  If you cut the sides off of it, is a porta potty really the worst desk chair?
[02:40.520 --> 02:42.700]  I think that there is a world in which that could work.
[02:42.920 --> 02:43.840]  Cut the side off.
[02:44.240 --> 02:47.140]  Yeah, well, because you don't want to be in a fucking you're like boxed in.
[02:47.260 --> 02:49.260]  It's like a phone booth if you got the whole thing.
[02:49.320 --> 02:54.160]  So if you cut the sides off and it's like a throne at that point, you slide the chair in.
[02:54.460 --> 02:56.540]  Why don't just cut it in half like horizontally?
[02:57.100 --> 02:58.260]  What do you mean, cut it in half?
[02:58.580 --> 03:00.160]  Well, how is that different than what I'm saying?
[03:00.500 --> 03:02.420]  Well, with the sides off, you still got a roof over it.
[03:02.420 --> 03:04.940]  Well, now, if you cut the sides, then there's clearly no roof.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.240]  What is supporting the roof if there are no sides, Gavin?
[03:07.320 --> 03:08.360]  That was sort of an assumed.
[03:09.120 --> 03:09.800]  You wouldn't.
[03:10.160 --> 03:11.600]  Do I leave the back up?
[03:11.760 --> 03:13.000]  That's actually a great question.
[03:13.660 --> 03:15.900]  I kind of like there's a little bit of a sun.
[03:16.020 --> 03:17.680]  You got a bat. You want the baton?
[03:18.320 --> 03:18.920]  I don't know.
[03:18.940 --> 03:20.540]  I think it would depend on the porta potty, right?
[03:20.600 --> 03:22.920]  If your back rests against the back wall or not.
[03:23.520 --> 03:25.360]  I think it's too big for any desk.
[03:25.860 --> 03:26.440]  You think so?
[03:26.460 --> 03:28.620]  I think I could fit a porta potty in here.
[03:28.820 --> 03:30.960]  And well, no, that's that's not true at all.
[03:30.960 --> 03:32.180]  You could even get it through the door.
[03:33.180 --> 03:33.900]  That's yeah.
[03:34.020 --> 03:34.300]  You know what?
[03:34.540 --> 03:36.900]  Honestly, getting it up the stairs would be the bigger issue.
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.260]  I think I could get it in the room.
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.680]  We'd have to get a lift of some kind to like bring it up to my level.
[03:42.880 --> 03:44.060]  And then we would be OK.
[03:44.300 --> 03:44.720]  I think.
[03:45.040 --> 03:46.220]  Do you think it would hit the ceiling?
[03:46.600 --> 03:48.120]  Oh, no, I got really tall ceilings.
[03:48.420 --> 03:50.820]  I got so much space going up. I'm good.
[03:51.620 --> 03:53.760]  We don't really utilize ceiling space either.
[03:53.860 --> 03:54.860]  Like, what should I feel like?
[03:54.920 --> 03:56.580]  It's dead space now that you bring it up.
[03:56.700 --> 03:59.360]  You were telling me last night that we also waste door frames.
[03:59.360 --> 04:01.240]  Yeah, the door frame doesn't do enough.
[04:01.400 --> 04:01.860]  It's true.
[04:02.240 --> 04:05.260]  There is not enough door frames just exist.
[04:05.700 --> 04:06.860]  I'd love your opinion on this, Geoff.
[04:06.920 --> 04:09.360]  When have you ever seen a door frame be utilized for anything
[04:09.360 --> 04:10.900]  outside of it being a door frame?
[04:11.420 --> 04:12.340]  Throw a light in that.
[04:13.100 --> 04:15.100]  Throw a light in the frame?
[04:15.420 --> 04:16.640]  Yeah, why not?
[04:16.720 --> 04:20.120]  Well, you want it to be like a status thing, like a progress thing.
[04:20.620 --> 04:21.680]  I did a pull up bar.
[04:21.860 --> 04:22.740]  Eric just said pull up bar.
[04:22.780 --> 04:23.600]  That's a great call.
[04:23.700 --> 04:27.660]  It's a good use for a door frame or halo, the halo ranking system.
[04:27.660 --> 04:32.240]  I was just saying it would be cool to have a visual indicator of the bar.
[04:32.780 --> 04:35.520]  And I figured, like, the door frame isn't being used at all.
[04:35.660 --> 04:37.460]  And it's like where you measure as a child.
[04:37.800 --> 04:39.980]  We've been playing so much Halo Infinite.
[04:40.340 --> 04:42.040]  We've been watching our little rank bars go up.
[04:42.180 --> 04:45.220]  And Andrew was just like, wouldn't this be great if instead of on here,
[04:45.240 --> 04:46.060]  it was on my door frame?
[04:46.520 --> 04:47.680]  And I was like, what are you talking about?
[04:47.940 --> 04:50.720]  And he was equating it to like when a kid gets taller
[04:50.720 --> 04:52.680]  and you measure the height on the wall.
[04:53.480 --> 04:56.620]  It's we it's it's well, because Gavin said I'm going up a bit.
[04:56.620 --> 04:59.720]  And I thought of like, oh, as a kid, like it was exciting
[04:59.720 --> 05:03.240]  when you'd go up a new notch and they put a new notch in the door frame.
[05:03.560 --> 05:07.400]  If you could have like a physical bar of light that showed your progress,
[05:07.640 --> 05:10.460]  it would be so great up and down, just like the nerves.
[05:10.580 --> 05:12.380]  Every time you go up, you go to use the bathroom,
[05:12.500 --> 05:16.060]  you're looking at that fucking bar like, oh, fuck, I need to next game.
[05:16.360 --> 05:17.620]  Next game's a big one.
[05:17.860 --> 05:21.000]  Even though we haven't recorded in two weeks,
[05:21.560 --> 05:23.020]  Andrew and I've been spending a lot of time together
[05:23.020 --> 05:24.460]  playing a little bit of Halo Infinite.
[05:24.980 --> 05:25.740]  Oh, that's cool.
[05:25.740 --> 05:27.300]  You guys haven't joined us.
[05:27.420 --> 05:29.020]  I haven't been invited. Oh.
[05:29.820 --> 05:32.200]  Yeah, that's that's how that's how that dies.
[05:32.720 --> 05:34.060]  When you don't invite me.
[05:34.120 --> 05:35.540]  I don't join. Yeah.
[05:36.060 --> 05:37.640]  Not a big mystery on that one, guys.
[05:37.920 --> 05:39.640]  Yeah, but everyone's just on. Everyone's just playing.
[05:39.960 --> 05:41.660]  I'm on playing Halo. I've played a bunch.
[05:42.340 --> 05:43.280]  Nobody's invited me. What rank are you?
[05:43.880 --> 05:45.360]  I'm only rank one.
[05:45.880 --> 05:47.480]  Yeah, rank one. Of what?
[05:48.080 --> 05:50.760]  Halo. Halo? Halo rank one.
[05:51.740 --> 05:55.720]  Do you remember in Halo 2, Geoff, how they had like symbols as the rank?
[05:55.720 --> 05:56.720]  We're talking about that.
[05:57.220 --> 06:00.040]  How like it was visually cool, but like you'd encounter somebody
[06:00.040 --> 06:03.580]  who is the fucking moon, like would move on from numbers at a certain point.
[06:03.640 --> 06:04.720]  It was just nonsensical.
[06:05.580 --> 06:06.220]  Vaguely, yeah.
[06:06.300 --> 06:09.560]  I remember the Halo Reach ranking better than any of the other ones, I think.
[06:10.140 --> 06:12.480]  What was that? That was just the the military.
[06:13.020 --> 06:16.940]  Yeah, I was just really it was very similar to actual military rank
[06:16.940 --> 06:18.100]  in a fun way for me.
[06:18.500 --> 06:22.220]  So I remember like trying to level just because I was it was I don't know, it was fun.
[06:22.740 --> 06:25.460]  Yeah, I've I've found I don't know if you've done
[06:25.460 --> 06:28.900]  the ranked games in Halo Infinite, but I've enjoyed it a lot more
[06:28.900 --> 06:31.720]  since becoming ranked and like really focusing in on that.
[06:31.820 --> 06:33.200]  I'd recommend you put time.
[06:33.580 --> 06:37.860]  I have only played quick, quick games like quick play, whatever it is.
[06:38.100 --> 06:40.100]  You should do ranked. It's a lot of fun.
[06:40.400 --> 06:41.280]  OK, I'll consider it.
[06:41.480 --> 06:46.340]  We had a great comment from a comment leaver recently that I saw
[06:46.340 --> 06:49.660]  because we had last week we were trying to discuss what someone who listens
[06:49.660 --> 06:51.480]  and doesn't leave a comment is called.
[06:51.820 --> 06:54.320]  And Geoff was saying like own leavers and stuff.
[06:54.320 --> 06:59.840]  There's someone on in a comment who whose name is I mean, Yolo, right?
[07:00.940 --> 07:02.580]  Suggested regulation listeners.
[07:02.700 --> 07:04.740]  I'm so glad you brought that up. I love that.
[07:05.140 --> 07:07.640]  I think I saw that as well on Twitter.
[07:07.640 --> 07:09.600]  And I thought that is fucking perfect.
[07:10.020 --> 07:11.840]  Regulation listeners and comment leavers.
[07:12.220 --> 07:15.840]  I thank you for bringing that up that I completely and totally agree.
[07:16.240 --> 07:17.080]  Regulation. There we go.
[07:17.540 --> 07:18.600]  Yeah, I think we're set.
[07:18.860 --> 07:21.560]  I think that's I don't even remember comment leavers debate
[07:22.060 --> 07:23.320]  and regulation listeners.
[07:23.320 --> 07:24.400]  There you go.
[07:24.600 --> 07:26.940]  Should we just sell both of those as an individual shirt?
[07:27.080 --> 07:28.580]  You could buy which one that you are.
[07:29.880 --> 07:33.620]  I really want to leave a comment, but I don't want to have to buy the shirt
[07:33.620 --> 07:35.840]  because I've already bought the regulation listener.
[07:36.060 --> 07:37.020]  It's a real problem.
[07:37.460 --> 07:39.200]  Maybe we can have like a trade in program.
[07:39.680 --> 07:42.060]  Yeah. Leave your first comment.
[07:43.400 --> 07:45.180]  Guys, I'm fucking out of it.
[07:45.260 --> 07:48.860]  I'm sorry. I'm so hungry and I'm so tired.
[07:49.460 --> 07:51.140]  We should have done this on a different day, probably.
[07:51.560 --> 07:52.980]  Oh, we ran out of days.
[07:53.160 --> 07:53.940]  This might kind of ran out.
[07:54.160 --> 07:55.340]  I'll take I you know what?
[07:55.360 --> 07:58.520]  I have multiple things I want to apologize for because we haven't recorded
[07:58.520 --> 08:02.180]  since the Cosmic Crisp review as little came in a little hot.
[08:02.260 --> 08:04.300]  I was sick at that time. Didn't realize it.
[08:04.580 --> 08:06.540]  I thought just bad sleep.
[08:06.980 --> 08:11.600]  I want to issue a proper, a formal apology to everybody.
[08:11.980 --> 08:14.360]  Oh, I don't think it was a trap. I appreciate it.
[08:14.420 --> 08:19.600]  As the I think I think you guys, I think the Apple fell against
[08:19.600 --> 08:23.640]  um, how do I not turn my apology into an insult?
[08:25.600 --> 08:26.720]  That's a great question.
[08:26.880 --> 08:30.860]  I don't think I don't think there's a great I don't think the room was filled.
[08:31.020 --> 08:32.580]  Nick seemed very Apple qualified.
[08:33.020 --> 08:36.020]  I think the rest of the people in the process of the review
[08:36.020 --> 08:39.400]  seemed a little less Apple qualified, not their favorite fruit.
[08:39.720 --> 08:42.020]  Kind of a strange it would be like if I reviewed a banana,
[08:42.620 --> 08:44.160]  but not to that extreme.
[08:44.500 --> 08:45.680]  What are we qualified at?
[08:45.680 --> 08:49.700]  I would find as a as a regulation human, I assume
[08:50.280 --> 08:55.120]  I would think I would find your banana review to be just as valid as anyone else's.
[08:55.260 --> 08:58.280]  I may not agree with your with your answer or results or your opinion,
[08:58.460 --> 09:00.040]  but I think the review is valid.
[09:00.340 --> 09:05.260]  I think on an echo chamber, all regulation humans have should have equal review say
[09:05.800 --> 09:09.580]  that's it's fair, but it's just I don't know if you're you're specializing
[09:09.580 --> 09:12.820]  in a specific thing for the majority of people
[09:12.820 --> 09:15.340]  to think that it can only be average at best.
[09:15.680 --> 09:19.220]  I feel like puts a ceiling on the extent of that review.
[09:19.620 --> 09:21.800]  Also, just the opinion of that person.
[09:21.960 --> 09:22.860]  And that makes sense.
[09:22.960 --> 09:24.340]  Like, it's not a special nobody here.
[09:24.580 --> 09:27.140]  I include myself. I'm not an Apple expert.
[09:27.380 --> 09:28.200]  I enjoy apples.
[09:28.780 --> 09:32.020]  The main point I wanted to apologize for is I said it was a trap.
[09:32.140 --> 09:35.760]  I said, you guys, it felt like a bit a prank is you guys didn't fail.
[09:35.780 --> 09:36.600]  It was Cosmic Crisp.
[09:36.900 --> 09:38.260]  They failed. They failed me.
[09:38.540 --> 09:41.260]  I reached out. I sent messages, no replies.
[09:41.520 --> 09:43.520]  I tried my best to get their product.
[09:43.520 --> 09:47.020]  It is not your guys's fault that I was not able to secure one.
[09:47.360 --> 09:48.680]  It's Cosmic Crisp's fault.
[09:48.740 --> 09:50.040]  So I apologize for the heat.
[09:50.420 --> 09:52.640]  I apologize for the declaration of revenge.
[09:53.720 --> 09:54.980]  Well, I appreciate that.
[09:55.380 --> 09:58.340]  Well, then let me apologize, Andrew, for something real fast,
[09:59.100 --> 10:02.420]  because since that moment, you know, I do I'm on the cameo.
[10:02.560 --> 10:03.920]  You know, I do some cameos from time to time.
[10:04.520 --> 10:09.500]  And since that moment, every Canadian cameo I've gotten, of which there have been,
[10:09.620 --> 10:11.940]  you know, it's been a week, so they're probably been six or seven.
[10:12.780 --> 10:17.680]  I have potentially turned those cameos into
[10:18.480 --> 10:22.520]  questions about how the fuck apples work in Canada and why you weren't able to get one
[10:22.520 --> 10:24.920]  and asking them if they could get Cosmic Crisps.
[10:25.060 --> 10:26.680]  And so far, nobody's gotten back to me.
[10:27.480 --> 10:30.560]  I kind of turned it around on them and made them all put them to work.
[10:31.220 --> 10:35.360]  But I did. I did maybe get a little a little spicy
[10:35.920 --> 10:38.780]  talking about your inability to get an apple to other Canadians.
[10:39.140 --> 10:39.980]  So I apologize for that.
[10:39.980 --> 10:41.820]  OK, did you eventually get one, Andrew?
[10:42.140 --> 10:43.220]  No, I still haven't got one.
[10:43.520 --> 10:45.580]  I'm still looking. I'm still looking.
[10:45.720 --> 10:47.760]  I'm on them. I'm trying to putting out feelers.
[10:47.860 --> 10:48.740]  I'm going on websites.
[10:49.460 --> 10:52.300]  Gav, imagine being a guy who loves apples.
[10:52.860 --> 10:56.860]  Consider it not not an expert, but like but certainly an apple enthusiast
[10:56.860 --> 11:00.160]  who lives in a without a doubt who lives in a country where apples
[11:00.160 --> 11:01.100]  aren't readily available.
[11:01.360 --> 11:03.000]  That's got to be a hard life for you.
[11:03.280 --> 11:04.200]  I got a lot of apples.
[11:04.280 --> 11:05.600]  I just don't got the Cosmic Crisps.
[11:05.700 --> 11:07.280]  I'm eating a Fuji right now.
[11:07.540 --> 11:08.980]  I got a Fuji on my desk.
[11:08.980 --> 11:10.780]  I got a mandarin orange on my desk.
[11:10.860 --> 11:14.560]  Is that from your private favorite apples list that you won't share?
[11:14.800 --> 11:15.360]  You know what?
[11:15.420 --> 11:18.480]  I'm not saying it's on the list, but we're down a little bit.
[11:18.900 --> 11:21.280]  If he's eating it at home, that's got to be top three.
[11:21.660 --> 11:24.880]  Oh, Eric and Nick are they're taking that as confirmation.
[11:25.540 --> 11:30.500]  There is very few apples I would refuse to just eat or that I wouldn't buy.
[11:30.720 --> 11:34.140]  If I see an apple, if I'm walking by, I'll grab that apple.
[11:34.460 --> 11:36.540]  I'll grab it. It's in a bag. I'll take it with me.
[11:36.540 --> 11:41.060]  I don't think there's any like value to assuming that because I have it in my house
[11:41.060 --> 11:42.560]  means it is a top apple for me.
[11:43.080 --> 11:43.940]  It's a lot of good apples.
[11:44.180 --> 11:49.000]  I don't understand why you would buy a non as such an enthusiast
[11:49.540 --> 11:52.220]  with such a refined apple palette.
[11:52.460 --> 11:54.600]  I don't know why you would buy a non top apple.
[11:54.820 --> 11:56.980]  Like, why would you own a non top apple in your house?
[11:57.600 --> 12:01.260]  Because if I if I'm just going by the fruit section,
[12:01.260 --> 12:04.180]  I maybe don't want to go into the heart of the jungle, Geoff.
[12:04.180 --> 12:06.820]  I maybe I'm on the perimeter and I'm like, you know what?
[12:07.340 --> 12:10.240]  Fuji isn't bad. I'll grab a Fuji instead of bag.
[12:10.460 --> 12:11.920]  Grab this bag of Fuji's.
[12:12.300 --> 12:15.440]  So are you so is this a situation where you can only buy apples on in caps?
[12:16.060 --> 12:19.620]  I did not not like restricted to that.
[12:19.700 --> 12:22.280]  But yeah, sometimes, you know, like we've talked about before,
[12:22.300 --> 12:25.000]  I'm not going down the aisle, just purchasing on the perimeter,
[12:25.040 --> 12:25.940]  on the edges of it.
[12:26.340 --> 12:28.580]  Sometimes you don't want to go into the heart of the fruit section.
[12:28.920 --> 12:33.260]  It's big. It's a vast section of you can get lost.
[12:33.260 --> 12:34.840]  They got organic products.
[12:34.960 --> 12:37.380]  Next thing you know, you got a whole fucking shopping cart of apples.
[12:37.680 --> 12:38.520]  You don't need that.
[12:38.840 --> 12:41.440]  I would love to see you get lost in a fruit section.
[12:42.220 --> 12:44.240]  I did when I bought bananas.
[12:44.360 --> 12:46.880]  As I said, I felt very lost. I felt very confused.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.220]  I didn't know if I needed a bag.
[12:48.280 --> 12:50.600]  I didn't know if I needed to write stuff down.
[12:51.180 --> 12:54.940]  There's a code to certain fruits that I am not aware of.
[12:55.280 --> 12:56.800]  Boy, we got dinged on codes.
[12:57.200 --> 13:00.740]  We made that dumb joke about how we had the serial numbers from the stickers.
[13:00.740 --> 13:03.500]  Oh, yeah. Obviously, it's a PLU code.
[13:03.580 --> 13:05.320]  It says it on it. We were just being silly.
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.120]  And that one angered a few a few people who work at grocery stores for some reason.
[13:10.220 --> 13:11.840]  No, it's the batch. It was the batch number.
[13:17.920 --> 13:18.640]  Jesus Christ.
[13:18.800 --> 13:21.260]  It was fun. I enjoyed doing that supplemental review
[13:21.260 --> 13:23.960]  as much as it didn't sound like I did at the time.
[13:24.140 --> 13:24.820]  I had a great time.
[13:25.240 --> 13:26.820]  And that's that's a little something for the audience.
[13:26.980 --> 13:30.640]  If you if you're not aware of if you somehow missed it.
[13:30.640 --> 13:34.740]  We dropped when the Apple dropped a couple of days after the Cosmic Crisp dropped.
[13:35.140 --> 13:38.720]  We dropped our review of it via the usual means, you know,
[13:38.760 --> 13:41.620]  the podcasting platforms and whatnot in the YouTube.
[13:41.900 --> 13:43.460]  But we didn't announce it ahead of time or anything.
[13:43.520 --> 13:44.240]  We just threw it out there.
[13:44.360 --> 13:45.160]  And it's not a full episode.
[13:45.240 --> 13:46.300]  It was just meant to be a review.
[13:47.060 --> 13:48.820]  Very angry, Andrew. Very interesting.
[13:49.260 --> 13:52.100]  I thought it was that was a little different and a lot of fun.
[13:52.120 --> 13:53.740]  And I hope we do more stuff like that in the future.
[13:54.280 --> 13:57.160]  There were the one criticism of the thing.
[13:57.160 --> 13:57.940]  It was very different.
[13:58.120 --> 14:00.880]  It felt being able to see made a big difference for me.
[14:01.420 --> 14:04.980]  I think that's why beyond being sick, I think that influenced my anger.
[14:05.360 --> 14:09.060]  Hearing you guys do a box opening and not being able to see the box
[14:09.060 --> 14:11.060]  or like review the thing was complicated.
[14:11.240 --> 14:13.180]  But you were angry after you were watching us.
[14:13.520 --> 14:15.500]  No, I was angry just in general.
[14:15.660 --> 14:19.120]  But it really like for you guys to be like, oh, it's a box filled with apples
[14:19.120 --> 14:22.160]  and me just looking at a fucking discord screen of nothing.
[14:22.720 --> 14:24.280]  That's how the audience feels.
[14:24.280 --> 14:27.640]  Yeah, but the audience isn't supposed to fucking comment on the box.
[14:27.780 --> 14:29.300]  They're not adding to the recording.
[14:29.560 --> 14:31.960]  Oh, they comment constantly, but they do.
[14:32.100 --> 14:33.120]  We do have a comment section.
[14:33.560 --> 14:36.580]  But you don't listen to a piece of audio expecting your comment
[14:36.580 --> 14:39.020]  to then impact the show that is currently happening.
[14:39.280 --> 14:41.400]  Sure, sure. I'll get there's a difference.
[14:42.140 --> 14:47.000]  I was supposed to be able to react to a thing, but I will say.
[14:47.980 --> 14:48.700]  Apple's great.
[14:48.900 --> 14:51.400]  I become a really big frozen raspberries guy.
[14:51.960 --> 14:53.180]  I love a frozen raspberry.
[14:53.740 --> 14:55.380]  I think we've talked about it before.
[14:55.920 --> 14:57.100]  Yeah, you must. Fantastic.
[14:57.260 --> 14:59.180]  Yeah, I have. I just take a photo.
[14:59.840 --> 15:02.000]  Well, no, I'm not just well, I'm kind of doing both.
[15:02.120 --> 15:06.800]  I get a glass of water, pour it in the well, no, I get a glass first empty glass.
[15:07.200 --> 15:08.740]  Got to fill it with raspberries.
[15:08.820 --> 15:10.920]  I feel like half the glass of frozen raspberries.
[15:11.320 --> 15:12.820]  Then you put the water in.
[15:13.340 --> 15:14.720]  It's great. It's like ice.
[15:14.800 --> 15:15.940]  You snack on it. It's delicious.
[15:16.160 --> 15:17.320]  I will take a photo. That's it.
[15:17.580 --> 15:19.260]  That's that's it. We'll step dad.
[15:19.620 --> 15:22.340]  Listen, it's we like a simple recipe, Gavin.
[15:22.340 --> 15:25.420]  You just get some frozen raspberries and throw it in a glass.
[15:26.160 --> 15:31.140]  And that's that's and that to you is better than a room
[15:31.140 --> 15:34.140]  temperature, normal, absolutely.
[15:34.880 --> 15:39.120]  I think he realized his step is his two step process was too short.
[15:39.200 --> 15:40.380]  So he added another step.
[15:40.400 --> 15:42.220]  And that was get a glass that's empty.
[15:42.300 --> 15:43.220]  No, no, no.
[15:43.520 --> 15:45.640]  This is how the glass starts is empty.
[15:46.040 --> 15:48.720]  No, this is you know what happened there?
[15:48.720 --> 15:50.940]  I'll give you the fucking honest truth of where my brain went.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.160]  I thought about bathtubs.
[15:52.160 --> 15:55.260]  OK, and when I get in the tub, I sit in an empty tub first.
[15:55.340 --> 15:56.280]  Then I put the water in.
[15:56.360 --> 15:57.600]  I don't put the water in first.
[15:57.900 --> 16:01.860]  You got to put the raspberries in because you need to have enough raspberries.
[16:02.020 --> 16:04.800]  If you put the water in first, you're limiting the amount of raspberries
[16:04.800 --> 16:05.660]  you can put into the glass.
[16:05.800 --> 16:08.600]  Well, what's stopping you from killing three birds with one stone?
[16:08.760 --> 16:12.500]  Take a bath, throw a bag of frozen raspberries in and snack away.
[16:12.820 --> 16:14.560]  Yeah, that's gross.
[16:14.760 --> 16:18.680]  No, I think of it like it's almost like romantic rose petals.
[16:18.920 --> 16:20.420]  But you know about it.
[16:20.420 --> 16:24.620]  It's you fucking there's oh, I vomit everywhere.
[16:24.660 --> 16:28.000]  I don't want you to keep your muffins on the boxy.
[16:28.460 --> 16:29.620]  Yeah, no, I don't.
[16:29.740 --> 16:34.180]  I put up in a bowl and I can't wait for you to visit here at one point.
[16:34.280 --> 16:37.380]  And you're going to sit in an empty tub and you're going to be like,
[16:37.440 --> 16:40.280]  you know what? That's a fucking convenient table right there.
[16:40.440 --> 16:42.200]  That is perfectly level.
[16:42.580 --> 16:48.500]  I don't see how putting your headset on the crust zone of a toilet
[16:48.500 --> 16:52.100]  is cleaner than eating raspberries from water.
[16:52.440 --> 16:56.300]  You know, water that you're in is the big like change.
[16:56.720 --> 16:57.820]  Like you're like water.
[16:58.480 --> 17:00.520]  Have a shower first, then hop in.
[17:00.960 --> 17:02.260]  Now there's too many steps.
[17:02.340 --> 17:04.960]  What am I showering? Is that step four, step five?
[17:05.040 --> 17:09.000]  You just throw them in a glass, throw them in a glass, add water to the glass.
[17:09.540 --> 17:11.180]  Get a spoon. What?
[17:12.120 --> 17:13.200]  What are you talking about?
[17:13.240 --> 17:14.140]  I don't fucking know.
[17:14.180 --> 17:15.440]  It sounds like you're making raspberry.
[17:16.160 --> 17:20.260]  You're countering that to my experience of having the raspberries in a glass.
[17:20.600 --> 17:23.440]  You're saying that that is a better like that would be the better move.
[17:23.780 --> 17:25.260]  And I'm saying there's too many steps.
[17:25.660 --> 17:27.380]  It's the biggest glass you could ask for.
[17:27.580 --> 17:31.380]  Yeah, I would like to point out that Eric, I think very astutely wrote
[17:31.380 --> 17:34.160]  the raspberries are Andrew and the cup is the bathtub.
[17:34.840 --> 17:35.600]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[17:35.740 --> 17:36.920]  Like nobody wants that.
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.020]  Like that's awful.
[17:38.120 --> 17:40.100]  Well, the raspberries probably don't want to be in the cup.
[17:40.140 --> 17:41.460]  Then if you don't want to be in the bathtub,
[17:41.460 --> 17:44.380]  I really do not care about the feelings of the raspberries.
[17:44.380 --> 17:47.620]  The raspberries considerations are at the bottom of my list.
[17:47.820 --> 17:48.440]  Here's what I see.
[17:48.600 --> 17:53.860]  I see dim turn the lights off, light some candles, play some soft music,
[17:53.960 --> 17:56.980]  maybe one of your favorite football team fight songs.
[17:57.120 --> 17:59.520]  Then you sprinkle some raspberry, whatever, you know,
[17:59.520 --> 18:00.740]  whatever you're listening to at the moment.
[18:01.120 --> 18:02.700]  State songs, whatever it is.
[18:02.820 --> 18:08.420]  And you sprinkle some raspberries, dip into the tub and just relax.
[18:08.440 --> 18:11.900]  And then occasionally when the mood strikes, just reach a little hand out.
[18:12.240 --> 18:13.660]  Pluck a raspberry out of the water.
[18:14.780 --> 18:15.220]  Yum.
[18:15.660 --> 18:17.180]  Andrew's taking himself on a date.
[18:17.740 --> 18:19.160]  I don't know. I don't like it.
[18:19.420 --> 18:20.400]  I'm not a fan of that.
[18:20.820 --> 18:21.560]  It seems gross.
[18:22.220 --> 18:23.240]  It seems disgusting.
[18:23.240 --> 18:28.060]  I'm fascinated by the line you draw between what's acceptable of what is gross,
[18:28.200 --> 18:29.980]  because I feel like for me, it's a nice straight line
[18:29.980 --> 18:33.700]  between all the normal gross shit and all the, you know, usual stuff.
[18:33.860 --> 18:35.300]  Yours is a bit of a wiggly one.
[18:35.520 --> 18:39.800]  It sort of goes around into gross as acceptable and back out.
[18:40.220 --> 18:41.720]  And this is apparently...
[18:41.720 --> 18:45.400]  There are certain things that enter into just the purely gross category
[18:45.400 --> 18:46.280]  that you'd never do.
[18:46.400 --> 18:50.480]  And then there are things where at the time, like it's easy for me to say now
[18:50.480 --> 18:51.700]  I would not do that thing.
[18:52.660 --> 18:54.360]  I lost him. I lost him.
[18:54.840 --> 18:56.020]  Yeah, he's he's gone.
[18:56.240 --> 18:57.320]  I just heard dang.
[18:57.900 --> 18:59.880]  And then he went and drifted away.
[19:00.140 --> 19:00.960]  Yeah, he's yeah.
[19:01.460 --> 19:03.200]  He's he went down the drain of the bathtub.
[19:03.720 --> 19:05.080]  Oh, Eric, I'm sorry.
[19:05.140 --> 19:05.640]  Geoff, have you shat yet?
[19:06.360 --> 19:07.360]  Today's the day, buddy.
[19:08.120 --> 19:09.380]  Now's the time to go shit.
[19:09.840 --> 19:11.100]  Now I'm OK at the moment.
[19:11.100 --> 19:13.300]  Are you sure you don't want to, like, push one out?
[19:13.660 --> 19:15.120]  No, there's no push it out.
[19:15.160 --> 19:16.880]  Oh, my God. It's just trying to hold it in.
[19:16.960 --> 19:17.560]  There's no pushing.
[19:18.180 --> 19:21.080]  It's just on the day I shit my pants six times.
[19:21.240 --> 19:21.820]  It was just water.
[19:22.300 --> 19:26.140]  I mean, it is literally if I recorded it, you wouldn't be able
[19:26.140 --> 19:28.020]  to tell the difference from me peeing and shitting.
[19:29.180 --> 19:30.540]  Wait, did I? Did I vanish?
[19:30.840 --> 19:31.740]  For a while.
[19:32.200 --> 19:34.060]  Oh, I would. I did a whole fucking.
[19:34.280 --> 19:34.980]  I did a whole thing.
[19:35.100 --> 19:36.060]  Oh, you should have done it for us.
[19:36.140 --> 19:36.880]  We would have loved it.
[19:36.920 --> 19:38.860]  I thought I thought everyone was listening.
[19:39.380 --> 19:41.580]  I was. Oh, where did I leave off?
[19:42.020 --> 19:43.720]  I said, Geoff is a shell of a man.
[19:43.920 --> 19:45.300]  And then there is no response.
[19:45.380 --> 19:47.940]  And I realized that I don't even think I heard that part.
[19:48.480 --> 19:49.960]  Yeah, no, we didn't hear.
[19:50.020 --> 19:52.380]  But we you've been gone for about 45 seconds.
[19:52.520 --> 19:56.160]  I did a whole fucking monologue about this thing.
[19:56.160 --> 19:57.220]  And it was silent.
[19:57.220 --> 19:59.480]  And I was like, I don't know if this is going really well
[19:59.480 --> 20:00.820]  or if you guys are just listening.
[20:01.040 --> 20:02.780]  I don't know how to feel about this.
[20:03.020 --> 20:07.240]  And then there was silence after I kind of threw a shot at Geoff.
[20:07.240 --> 20:09.640]  No response is like something is clearly broken.
[20:09.840 --> 20:13.440]  And I came back to fucking Geoff talking about shitting,
[20:13.560 --> 20:15.760]  which funny enough, is where I was leading anyway.
[20:16.020 --> 20:18.200]  And so it synced up. I was very confused.
[20:18.380 --> 20:21.200]  Well, do you want to go back and insult me where we where we can all hear it?
[20:21.340 --> 20:24.820]  I was just saying that I think the gross line, it can change
[20:24.820 --> 20:26.780]  based off of where you're where you're at.
[20:26.980 --> 20:28.800]  If you're exhausted, you're having a bad day.
[20:28.860 --> 20:33.100]  Maybe what would seem gross in an ideal scenario is acceptable at that time.
[20:33.140 --> 20:34.300]  I see. That was sort of.
[20:34.300 --> 20:39.860]  Are you saying that you think that like potentially my view of the grossness
[20:39.860 --> 20:45.060]  of your raspberry romance bath is being affected by this?
[20:45.180 --> 20:49.960]  My my current situation, like if I was that if I was like a healthy, happy Geoff,
[20:50.040 --> 20:51.560]  I might I might find it a little grosser.
[20:51.980 --> 20:54.620]  Exactly. That's what I was saying, where Geoff is like, you're not
[20:54.620 --> 20:56.260]  you're not 100% right now.
[20:56.420 --> 20:57.700]  I'm not. Maybe there's a thing.
[20:59.380 --> 21:00.560]  What percent are you?
[21:00.560 --> 21:02.440]  Uh, I'm going to.
[21:02.640 --> 21:07.400]  So I came in thinking I was at like 85%.
[21:07.400 --> 21:09.040]  I felt pretty good about it.
[21:09.300 --> 21:13.360]  And and then then y'all got y'all got me immediately.
[21:14.380 --> 21:16.500]  And I realized I wasn't at 80%.
[21:16.500 --> 21:18.340]  I was at more like 40.
[21:25.860 --> 21:30.320]  This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp Online Therapy.
[21:30.340 --> 21:33.640]  The best way to think about therapy is through analogies that it's OK.
[21:33.640 --> 21:37.660]  I know that sounds like school stuff, smart guy stuff, but it's it's not.
[21:37.740 --> 21:38.320]  Let me explain.
[21:38.700 --> 21:42.020]  We get our oil change for our car to prevent bigger issues down the road.
[21:42.140 --> 21:44.160]  I don't know if you've ever had an engine seize up,
[21:44.420 --> 21:47.140]  but I have in an old pickup truck, piston seized.
[21:47.600 --> 21:50.460]  And that was like a twelve hundred dollar issue
[21:50.460 --> 21:53.980]  that a dollar ninety eight in oil would have fixed.
[21:54.140 --> 21:57.260]  We see the doctor and we go to the gym to take care of our bodies
[21:57.260 --> 21:58.980]  to prevent injury and disease as well.
[21:59.360 --> 22:03.040]  We do these things regularly to stay healthy, stay ahead of the curve.
[22:03.040 --> 22:04.580]  And to keep moving forward.
[22:05.020 --> 22:07.100]  Going to therapy is like all of that, too.
[22:07.480 --> 22:10.240]  It's routine maintenance for your mental and emotional wellness
[22:10.240 --> 22:12.180]  to prevent bigger issues down the road.
[22:12.620 --> 22:16.560]  And BetterHelp is customized online therapy that offers video, phone,
[22:16.680 --> 22:18.620]  even live chat sessions with your therapist.
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.460]  So you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.
[22:21.780 --> 22:24.020]  It is much more affordable than in-person therapy.
[22:24.380 --> 22:27.460]  And you can start communicating with your therapist in under 48 hours.
[22:27.900 --> 22:31.460]  So why invest in everything else in your life, but not your mind?

[24:07.340 --> 24:11.960]  Can I tell you a story of pain and misery that might might bring you up a little bit?
[24:12.180 --> 24:12.320]  Please.
[24:12.600 --> 24:13.740]  My pain, my suffering.
[24:14.320 --> 24:15.780]  I'm laying in bed last night.
[24:16.340 --> 24:17.220]  Gavin and I played Halo.
[24:17.620 --> 24:18.860]  I'm crawling into bed.
[24:18.900 --> 24:19.980]  It's like 11 p.m.
[24:20.280 --> 24:20.820]  Oh, my God.
[24:20.820 --> 24:21.660]  I was up playing.
[24:21.900 --> 24:23.520]  I could have played Halo at 11 p.m.
[24:24.240 --> 24:25.120]  Oh, we should go play.
[24:25.260 --> 24:26.660]  You have my fucking phone number.
[24:26.660 --> 24:28.060]  You have my email address.
[24:28.160 --> 24:30.280]  You have my Xbox Live gamer tag.
[24:30.280 --> 24:33.000]  You just got a pool of people online, though.
[24:33.080 --> 24:34.000]  You don't get people online.
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.140]  The pool of people online?
[24:35.340 --> 24:37.920]  I am so- I'm the other person in this podcast.
[24:38.600 --> 24:39.860]  You're appearing offline, then.
[24:39.900 --> 24:40.980]  I didn't see online.
[24:41.460 --> 24:43.360]  I would have definitely if I saw you online.
[24:43.540 --> 24:45.540]  I don't ever see either of you online.
[24:47.680 --> 24:49.660]  Are you guys appearing online?
[24:50.180 --> 24:52.600]  I'm definitely doing something.
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.860]  But what I was doing last night was I was in bed.
[24:55.860 --> 24:59.480]  You got everybody's appearing offline, but somehow I get left out.
[24:59.580 --> 25:00.060]  It's fine.
[25:00.140 --> 25:03.380]  I understand my place in this podcast family.
[25:03.460 --> 25:06.260]  I am at the bottom of the pile.
[25:06.520 --> 25:07.920]  I'm the one that you invite.
[25:08.140 --> 25:09.280]  Nobody else is around.
[25:09.440 --> 25:10.560]  Andrew's too sick to play.
[25:11.060 --> 25:12.600]  Nick is taking care of the baby.
[25:12.780 --> 25:13.680]  And Eric's playing baseball.
[25:13.920 --> 25:17.280]  Maybe Gavin will hit me up if he can be bothered to remember my fucking phone number.
[25:17.280 --> 25:18.040]  I get it.
[25:18.200 --> 25:20.520]  Anyway, Andrew, you were saying something gross.
[25:21.040 --> 25:22.340]  So, no, it's not gross.
[25:22.420 --> 25:23.360]  I was laying in bed.
[25:23.360 --> 25:25.980]  And, you know, when you have those, I don't know.
[25:26.160 --> 25:28.280]  I feel like this is relatable where you're in bed, you're comfy,
[25:28.440 --> 25:31.560]  but you kind of have a thought like, oh, what if I go down and do this instead?
[25:31.660 --> 25:32.560]  What if I get a snack?
[25:32.740 --> 25:34.560]  What if I get a drink of something?
[25:34.780 --> 25:38.480]  Yeah, but I'm so cozy and you have that like real struggle.
[25:38.480 --> 25:39.480]  And I had that.
[25:39.600 --> 25:40.160]  I was like, you know what?
[25:40.180 --> 25:42.040]  It's fucking we're getting into the winter season.
[25:42.140 --> 25:43.260]  My favorite time of year.
[25:43.600 --> 25:44.960]  Yeah, you're battling the cozy wool.
[25:45.320 --> 25:48.580]  Some hot chocolate right now would be fucking delicious.
[25:48.880 --> 25:51.980]  What a like just a nice little cup of hot cocoa.
[25:52.340 --> 25:56.060]  Oh, man, what a time I was laying there.
[25:56.120 --> 25:58.560]  I thought I had this fight in my head for twenty five minutes.
[25:58.700 --> 26:00.120]  Do I get up? I'm so comfy.
[26:00.380 --> 26:01.540]  Do I get hot chocolate?
[26:01.640 --> 26:04.080]  I decide I'm going to go get some hot chocolate.
[26:04.180 --> 26:04.900]  So I go down.
[26:05.240 --> 26:07.340]  I get the milk going. It's nice and warm.
[26:07.420 --> 26:08.380]  I'm doing it all fancy.
[26:08.520 --> 26:10.180]  I got the marshmallows out.
[26:10.480 --> 26:11.580]  Are you doing it in a pan?
[26:12.180 --> 26:13.060]  I'm doing it.
[26:13.380 --> 26:14.800]  I'm doing it in a pot.
[26:14.880 --> 26:16.860]  I'm doing I'm like taking my time.
[26:16.960 --> 26:18.040]  I'm enjoying the experience.
[26:18.140 --> 26:19.720]  I got my calories in the cupboard.
[26:20.220 --> 26:25.820]  I got my the kettle is there's so many people that want to fight me that that is a kettle.
[26:25.980 --> 26:28.180]  It's the most ridiculous having to send product links.
[26:28.240 --> 26:31.000]  But anyway, the thing is being made.
[26:31.040 --> 26:31.780]  It's delicious.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.900]  I got my tablet in one hand, whipped cream, marshmallow.
[26:35.160 --> 26:36.940]  It's hot. It's fantastic.
[26:37.500 --> 26:38.720]  I turn around.
[26:39.060 --> 26:40.720]  I take four steps.
[26:40.880 --> 26:46.780]  I drop my tablet, hit my forearm, shift my forearm, spill hot chocolate everywhere,
[26:46.780 --> 26:52.060]  largely on myself, burn my shoulder, just scorch my shoulder with hot milk.
[26:52.380 --> 26:53.960]  I got whipped cream on the ceiling.
[26:54.360 --> 26:56.460]  I got marshmallows on the door.
[26:56.900 --> 26:58.640]  I think it's so much velocity.
[26:59.300 --> 27:00.700]  It flew everywhere.
[27:00.920 --> 27:05.000]  I don't know, Gavin, how it got so much velocity, but it went fucking everywhere.
[27:05.120 --> 27:07.320]  Because as I've just learned, you've got high ceilings.
[27:07.760 --> 27:09.620]  I do. I do have high ceiling.
[27:09.680 --> 27:11.480]  It fucking flew.
[27:11.880 --> 27:12.660]  It flew everywhere.
[27:12.760 --> 27:13.560]  I burnt myself.
[27:14.040 --> 27:16.540]  The speaker on my tablet no longer works.
[27:16.540 --> 27:18.440]  I broke that in the hot chocolate.
[27:18.920 --> 27:21.060]  I had to clean everything up.
[27:21.280 --> 27:23.300]  I immediately my shirt still in the kitchen.
[27:23.640 --> 27:24.340]  It's just there.
[27:24.400 --> 27:25.320]  I took the shirt off.
[27:25.380 --> 27:26.640]  It was covered in hot chocolate.
[27:27.160 --> 27:27.600]  Miserable.
[27:27.800 --> 27:28.720]  It was miserable.
[27:29.040 --> 27:31.200]  It was one of the worst hot chocolate experiences I've ever had.
[27:31.320 --> 27:32.200]  I cleaned everything up.
[27:32.540 --> 27:34.100]  I had a quarter of a cup left.
[27:34.220 --> 27:37.820]  I shot some whipped cream in there and I just sat downstairs and watched Seinfeld
[27:37.820 --> 27:40.500]  sad, eating the remains of my hot chocolate.
[27:41.880 --> 27:42.840]  It was terrible.
[27:43.600 --> 27:44.460]  Miserable experience.
[27:45.160 --> 27:46.580]  After all the effort, you didn't just make a new one?
[27:47.040 --> 27:48.860]  No, I was broken.
[27:48.960 --> 27:50.440]  I was a broken man, Gavin.
[27:50.780 --> 27:51.940]  I had a burnt shoulder.
[27:52.100 --> 27:54.240]  I was picking marshmallows up off the floor.
[27:54.720 --> 27:58.520]  Having to put stuff in the garbage that you know is delicious is always crushing.
[27:59.120 --> 28:02.380]  I'm just sitting in the dark watching Seinfeld at 1 a.m.
[28:03.300 --> 28:03.740]  Miserable.
[28:04.200 --> 28:05.380]  And this is after we played Halo?
[28:05.900 --> 28:06.600]  This is after.
[28:06.860 --> 28:08.900]  Yeah, this is like maybe 40 minutes after.
[28:09.280 --> 28:10.400]  My whole evening was ruined.
[28:10.580 --> 28:11.780]  I should have just stayed in bed.
[28:11.780 --> 28:13.480]  That's all I kept thinking about.
[28:13.640 --> 28:14.660]  I should have just stayed in bed.
[28:15.100 --> 28:18.420]  I stayed in bed and I got no whipped cream on any ceiling.
[28:19.100 --> 28:20.280]  Fucking, oh, it's the worst.
[28:20.880 --> 28:21.280]  It's terrible.
[28:22.200 --> 28:22.820]  It was...
[28:23.440 --> 28:24.340]  I've had a bad run.
[28:24.400 --> 28:24.860]  Well, I'm sorry.
[28:24.960 --> 28:26.860]  I'm sorry that happened to you, man.
[28:27.280 --> 28:29.720]  I feel like burning the shoulder only is a rare one.
[28:30.060 --> 28:33.240]  Like I could maybe it would get up to the shoulder if you like burnt your whole arm.
[28:33.680 --> 28:35.760]  It only burnt a corner of my shoulder.
[28:36.200 --> 28:37.960]  And I luckily avoided the cat.
[28:38.120 --> 28:41.200]  That is like the biggest thing that I don't know how the cat didn't get hit
[28:41.200 --> 28:42.500]  by any of it, voided them.
[28:42.980 --> 28:44.900]  Sam. Sam. Yeah.
[28:45.660 --> 28:46.520]  Do you know that?
[28:46.800 --> 28:47.380]  I know that.
[28:47.500 --> 28:48.360]  You're aware of this cat.
[28:48.680 --> 28:49.500]  20 years old.
[28:50.420 --> 28:51.860]  It's yes, she is.
[28:52.120 --> 28:53.440]  It's it's been I don't know.
[28:53.580 --> 28:54.900]  It was a rough night in that regard.
[28:55.180 --> 28:57.240]  I'm just spilling shit all over the place.
[28:57.500 --> 28:59.240]  I I've become a maple syrup guy.
[28:59.840 --> 29:01.680]  It's a big addition in my life.
[29:02.260 --> 29:04.020]  Really gotten into maple syrup recently.
[29:04.100 --> 29:07.900]  I was making some pancakes, took them upstairs, put I was carrying a lot of stuff.
[29:07.980 --> 29:09.940]  I think my issue is I'm carrying too many things at once.
[29:09.940 --> 29:12.520]  Well, yeah, you've always got a tablet in your hands.
[29:14.880 --> 29:17.280]  I'd like six different things in my hands,
[29:17.360 --> 29:21.900]  and I'm going to sit at my desk to eat my pancakes with a lot of maple syrup.
[29:22.180 --> 29:24.400]  And I put the plate on the bed for a minute.
[29:24.520 --> 29:27.320]  And then I think, oh, fuck, there is so much maple syrup on that.
[29:27.560 --> 29:29.060]  And I quickly grab it.
[29:29.580 --> 29:33.000]  Luckily, didn't come off as like, well, that could have been really bad.
[29:33.040 --> 29:34.580]  So I continue with the rest of my night,
[29:35.080 --> 29:38.620]  crawl in the bed, ready to sleep, pull up the first blanket.
[29:38.620 --> 29:43.100]  It's drenched in maple syrup, just coated in it.
[29:43.360 --> 29:47.280]  I was like, oh, it's one like I just want to go to bed.
[29:48.080 --> 29:52.660]  Fuck. See, that's that's where our lines between acceptable and gross differ,
[29:52.660 --> 29:54.720]  because I don't want to put food in my bed.
[29:54.920 --> 29:55.900]  I don't want food anywhere.
[29:56.020 --> 29:58.200]  No, it was just there for a moment.
[29:58.260 --> 30:02.240]  I put the plate down for a second because I had so many things in my hand
[30:02.240 --> 30:04.600]  to adjust, to put other stuff on the desk.
[30:04.640 --> 30:07.020]  Then I immediately grabbed the food from the bed.
[30:07.340 --> 30:08.320]  It was just at an angle.
[30:08.320 --> 30:11.400]  The plate was at an angle and all the maple syrup poured off the pancakes
[30:11.400 --> 30:13.380]  onto the blanket.
[30:14.040 --> 30:14.680]  So you were sticky.
[30:15.160 --> 30:16.000]  It was all sticky.
[30:16.460 --> 30:18.280]  Both blankets were. I threw that off.
[30:18.360 --> 30:19.280]  I was like, well, at least I have another.
[30:19.400 --> 30:21.840]  Oh, no, this one's also fucking covered in maple syrup.
[30:22.100 --> 30:23.160]  That's just coated in it.
[30:23.180 --> 30:25.500]  My whole arm, everything. Terrible.
[30:26.780 --> 30:28.860]  How did it get on the other blanket?
[30:29.040 --> 30:29.840]  It's so viscous.
[30:29.900 --> 30:31.580]  I wouldn't imagine it would go through quickly.
[30:32.020 --> 30:34.140]  I think it just hit double coverage.
[30:34.400 --> 30:36.900]  I think it hit both of them at the same time and I didn't see it.
[30:36.900 --> 30:38.700]  There's a lot of maple syrup on my plate.
[30:38.780 --> 30:42.260]  And I think it just slid off and coated two different blankets.
[30:43.300 --> 30:45.400]  And I can never get maple syrup right.
[30:45.520 --> 30:48.480]  I feel like I'm putting too much on and then I get to eat the pancakes
[30:48.480 --> 30:49.760]  and suddenly it's all absorbed.
[30:49.900 --> 30:51.580]  And I'm like, where the hell did all the maple syrup go?
[30:51.640 --> 30:52.460]  I can't even taste it.
[30:52.520 --> 30:54.260]  And I put more. It's it's really hot.
[30:54.320 --> 30:56.600]  It's a surprisingly difficult condiment to get right.
[30:56.660 --> 30:57.860]  I feel like. Really?
[30:58.380 --> 31:01.440]  I put zero thought into. You just drown it.
[31:02.060 --> 31:05.380]  Well, I'm not necessarily drowning it, but I've never been like,
[31:05.380 --> 31:06.820]  oh, that's too much or too little.
[31:06.980 --> 31:08.520]  It's like, that's just I have maple syrup.
[31:08.960 --> 31:09.840]  That's interesting.
[31:09.960 --> 31:13.340]  I've never even considered the possibility of like loading too much on it.
[31:13.780 --> 31:15.920]  Are you working on your pancake mix that you ordered?
[31:16.080 --> 31:17.140]  Is that where you get the pancakes?
[31:17.300 --> 31:20.980]  Yeah, I'm still. No, I'm still going through my 70 pounds.
[31:21.240 --> 31:23.620]  I don't think I finished a 10 pound bag of it.
[31:23.720 --> 31:24.760]  I'm still working through it.
[31:25.060 --> 31:27.300]  I totally forgot about that 70 pounds of.
[31:27.900 --> 31:29.340]  Isn't it close to expiring?
[31:29.760 --> 31:31.360]  I think it expires in 2023.
[31:31.800 --> 31:33.840]  I think I got some time. I think I'm good.
[31:33.900 --> 31:35.300]  But yeah, I've been I've been working away.
[31:35.300 --> 31:37.140]  I'm almost done my first 10 pound bag.
[31:38.320 --> 31:40.840]  I'll gladly make you pancakes if you guys ever come over.
[31:41.540 --> 31:42.940]  I'm so excited to come over.
[31:43.200 --> 31:45.460]  Yeah, you can eat them in the tub and you'll see.
[31:46.980 --> 31:51.420]  Let's let's be sure to make it when we do that an official face event.
[31:51.500 --> 31:52.440]  So I get the invite to.
[31:53.120 --> 31:55.060]  Oh, you're always invited, Geoff.
[31:55.180 --> 31:57.920]  Am I? Was I invited to Halo for the last week?
[31:58.220 --> 32:00.800]  I had an interesting thought while I was listening to all these stories.
[32:00.800 --> 32:03.520]  And I was thinking I was thinking about a fun bit we could do
[32:04.220 --> 32:06.620]  would be I could put out like a request
[32:06.620 --> 32:10.640]  and try to find some new or real friends who actually like me
[32:10.640 --> 32:11.500]  and want to spend time with me.
[32:11.880 --> 32:13.840]  I texted you guys at 10 o'clock this morning.
[32:14.380 --> 32:17.500]  You, Eric and and Gavin.
[32:18.000 --> 32:20.660]  Once again, not nobody responded to me.
[32:20.720 --> 32:23.820]  But it's becoming very clear to me the question.
[32:24.020 --> 32:24.860]  It wasn't a question.
[32:24.940 --> 32:26.760]  It was a conversation starter.
[32:27.540 --> 32:28.740]  Do you do you ever text me?
[32:29.520 --> 32:33.220]  OK, this is the thing to text saying today is going to be interesting.
[32:33.220 --> 32:35.020]  Oh, the day we record the podcast.
[32:35.280 --> 32:36.160]  Oh, I think it is.
[32:36.760 --> 32:38.100]  Hell yeah. Can't wait.
[32:38.240 --> 32:40.240]  Yeah, that was my reaction, too.
[32:40.340 --> 32:42.900]  I thought that that was like a, oh, exciting.
[32:43.000 --> 32:44.540]  Save it for the show type thing.
[32:44.580 --> 32:45.660]  And you thought, hell yeah.
[32:45.760 --> 32:46.460]  Shitting my brain.
[32:46.600 --> 32:48.100]  And he doesn't deserve a reply.
[32:48.580 --> 32:50.820]  I was trying to start a conversation with you guys.
[32:51.280 --> 32:53.720]  And my point being, it's very, very and it's OK.
[32:53.800 --> 32:55.700]  It's OK because it's a it's a day job.
[32:55.840 --> 32:57.600]  We all got to make our paychecks. I get it.
[32:57.780 --> 32:59.900]  We do. We have we have great onscreen chemistry.
[33:00.160 --> 33:01.880]  But I think a fun bit I didn't have this in my notes
[33:01.880 --> 33:02.860]  because I just came up with this right now.
[33:02.860 --> 33:04.880]  But I think a fun, cool thing we could do is maybe I could like
[33:04.880 --> 33:08.480]  put out a call to the comment leavers and the regulation listeners that like,
[33:08.580 --> 33:10.600]  hey, I might want to play Halo with friends.
[33:10.840 --> 33:12.620]  I might want to text with people back and forth
[33:12.620 --> 33:14.760]  and have them respond to me within three or four days.
[33:14.900 --> 33:16.120]  Like the last time I brought it up.
[33:17.040 --> 33:19.040]  Maybe there's some people out there who may not think
[33:19.040 --> 33:21.460]  maybe think that there's some value in old Geoff as a friend
[33:21.460 --> 33:23.120]  and may just want to have a conversation with me.
[33:23.200 --> 33:25.020]  If you're out there, let me know on Twitter or something.
[33:25.060 --> 33:26.020]  I'm currently in the market.
[33:26.240 --> 33:27.800]  I love having conversations.
[33:28.260 --> 33:30.800]  I'm so lonely and I don't have any friends to talk to.
[33:30.880 --> 33:32.440]  So audience, hit me up.
[33:32.440 --> 33:34.800]  We'll talk daily. What do you mean?
[33:35.360 --> 33:39.480]  I don't feel like today is going to be interesting.
[33:39.760 --> 33:42.040]  G is what you texted the group text.
[33:42.960 --> 33:46.220]  I was I read that, Geoff, with excitement thinking,
[33:46.420 --> 33:49.900]  oh, I don't want to ask about it in the text because I don't want to ruin
[33:49.900 --> 33:51.260]  what will happen on the show.
[33:51.360 --> 33:54.220]  There's a huge risk with responding to the group chat.
[33:54.300 --> 33:57.580]  We could easily blow all of our reactions to something good.
[33:57.800 --> 33:59.220]  It's it's a massive risk.
[33:59.220 --> 34:01.120]  And I can't believe you're acting like it isn't.
[34:01.120 --> 34:02.500]  Let's see.
[34:02.880 --> 34:05.480]  The last time we'll go back through our text a little bit
[34:05.480 --> 34:07.040]  because Gavin and I talk daily.
[34:08.500 --> 34:12.220]  On Saturday, I texted Gavin and I said,
[34:12.920 --> 34:15.120]  hey, text me back. Eventually you did.
[34:15.800 --> 34:19.400]  And then I we talked about some stuff eventually.
[34:20.320 --> 34:26.200]  Then then Sunday, November 7th, which was this is the I sent you a video.
[34:26.340 --> 34:27.500]  And I said, have you seen this?
[34:27.600 --> 34:30.620]  And you said, yeah, back. Eventually I text you back.
[34:30.620 --> 34:33.100]  You text me at nine twenty four a.m.
[34:33.160 --> 34:34.780]  I replied at ten oh six.
[34:35.020 --> 34:37.200]  That's not eventually. No, that's fine.
[34:37.320 --> 34:38.060]  That's pretty good.
[34:38.160 --> 34:41.160]  Then the next time we talked on our daily talk was Sunday, November 7th.
[34:41.160 --> 34:42.880]  I sent you a video and I said, have you seen this?
[34:42.920 --> 34:44.000]  And then you said, yeah.
[34:44.040 --> 34:47.880]  And then I sent you a video on Sunday or I sent you a text on the Sunday
[34:47.880 --> 34:49.220]  to ask how you were feeling.
[34:49.560 --> 34:50.900]  And then you responded.
[34:51.180 --> 34:54.700]  But at no point in any of oh, and then I said again,
[34:54.700 --> 34:56.620]  I sent you another text to see how you were feeling.
[34:57.300 --> 35:01.760]  And at no point in any of these conversations, did you reach out to me first?
[35:01.900 --> 35:04.620]  This is only me reaching out, desperate for a friend,
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.480]  getting one or two word answers and then moving on with my life
[35:07.480 --> 35:08.660]  and then trying to get a week later.
[35:09.980 --> 35:14.360]  I I can't refute that that we're talking about text messages is awful.
[35:15.000 --> 35:16.740]  We were on the podcast on Monday.
[35:16.920 --> 35:18.760]  Well, that was another day we didn't need to text.
[35:19.040 --> 35:20.620]  If it's so much of you.
[35:21.080 --> 35:23.100]  Yeah. OK, well, great.
[35:23.620 --> 35:25.480]  Happy to do more, as always.
[35:26.080 --> 35:31.720]  I feel like if you if you're if you're teeing up some good face stuff,
[35:31.760 --> 35:34.200]  the best thing to do is just to wait to hear it.
[35:34.420 --> 35:36.960]  I think that was the misunderstanding in that text, Geoff.
[35:37.020 --> 35:39.540]  I think clearly it was about the colonoscopy that it was.
[35:39.660 --> 35:43.120]  I was trying to talk to you guys about my thing and then just nobody.
[35:43.320 --> 35:44.960]  Nobody seemed interested in responding to me.
[35:45.020 --> 35:47.640]  So I thought, oh, well, I'm not going to burden them with my problems
[35:47.640 --> 35:49.580]  because they can't even be bothered to respond to me.
[35:49.840 --> 35:51.060]  I was also at work.
[35:51.120 --> 35:52.640]  I was in the middle of a let's play.
[35:52.720 --> 35:55.000]  I'm not going to you know, I'm about to come out.
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.260]  I arrived home late, like five minutes after we started
[35:59.260 --> 36:01.080]  because I didn't have any time. I haven't even eaten yet.
[36:01.680 --> 36:03.260]  There's all this, all these demands.
[36:03.820 --> 36:04.360]  It's not a demand.
[36:04.600 --> 36:06.540]  It was like five hours ago, four hours ago.
[36:06.580 --> 36:07.960]  I sent that text. I was at work.
[36:09.080 --> 36:11.000]  I was in the video that you didn't go to.
[36:11.860 --> 36:14.080]  We could, to be just completely honest,
[36:14.740 --> 36:16.920]  that could have we could have recorded 10 hours from now.
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.860]  I still wouldn't have responded because I thought it was show related.
[36:20.060 --> 36:23.580]  I thought it was like, oh, exciting thing for the show.
[36:24.120 --> 36:24.780]  All right. That's fine.
[36:24.780 --> 36:25.540]  It doesn't have to be.
[36:25.840 --> 36:28.040]  Well, I rescind everything I've said.
[36:28.160 --> 36:29.540]  Then you guys are the best.
[36:29.980 --> 36:31.800]  I look forward to playing Halo with you constantly.
[36:31.900 --> 36:33.520]  It sounds like we do it all the time.
[36:33.540 --> 36:34.220]  I'd look, you know what?
[36:34.340 --> 36:34.720]  I, you know what?
[36:34.840 --> 36:35.800]  You know what I look forward to?
[36:36.040 --> 36:37.780]  Somebody texting me first one day.
[36:38.140 --> 36:38.880]  I texted you.
[36:38.900 --> 36:42.900]  You texted me first yesterday and then started a conversation with me
[36:42.900 --> 36:44.440]  and then disappeared.
[36:44.700 --> 36:46.260]  And then when I said, hey, what's up, man?
[36:46.280 --> 36:47.000]  Are you going to tell me that thing?
[36:47.000 --> 36:47.880]  You said, oh, never mind.
[36:47.940 --> 36:49.480]  I had the conversation with Gavin.
[36:49.740 --> 36:51.320]  I don't want to have it with you again.
[36:51.380 --> 36:52.300]  You need to talk.
[36:52.300 --> 36:53.980]  So this was massive texting.
[36:54.260 --> 36:55.160]  I'll fucking read it.
[36:55.420 --> 36:58.300]  No, please do, because this is a whole this.
[36:58.440 --> 37:00.860]  You have no idea how how like bad I felt.
[37:01.060 --> 37:02.580]  I felt bad on so many levels.
[37:02.760 --> 37:03.820]  And this has happened before.
[37:03.980 --> 37:05.660]  But it's the first time I've been trapped.
[37:05.840 --> 37:08.820]  You texted me out of the blue, which I appreciated.
[37:08.900 --> 37:11.140]  It was the and you said, I have an idea.
[37:11.440 --> 37:12.600]  And I said, go on.
[37:13.020 --> 37:15.900]  And then I didn't hear from you for three minutes.
[37:15.900 --> 37:18.020]  And then you responded to me and you said, I hate myself.
[37:18.360 --> 37:20.000]  And then you said, I told it all to Gavin.
[37:20.060 --> 37:21.980]  And I said, OK, should I go?
[37:21.980 --> 37:24.720]  And I was like, OK, so should I ask Gavin for the information then?
[37:24.820 --> 37:27.160]  And you go, no, just I'm not going to tell you.
[37:27.240 --> 37:28.120]  Just save it for the show.
[37:28.200 --> 37:31.980]  We'll do it. OK, we can have even when you're texting me,
[37:32.120 --> 37:34.680]  even when you're trying to have a conversation with me, you're not.
[37:34.760 --> 37:35.700]  You're doing it with someone else.
[37:35.700 --> 37:36.420]  You're doing it with Gavin.
[37:36.680 --> 37:39.660]  Let's just cut me out of the out of the out of the conversation completely.
[37:40.060 --> 37:40.780]  Absolutely not.
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.620]  Let's just I want you to hear my position on this, my perspective.
[37:45.360 --> 37:49.820]  I texted you that thing, and I was so excited to talk to you about it, Geoff.
[37:49.820 --> 37:52.240]  Like, genuinely, I was like, I can't wait to talk to Geoff.
[37:52.520 --> 37:54.360]  Here's opinion. I value it.
[37:54.400 --> 37:56.080]  He's so funny. He's a creative guy.
[37:56.180 --> 37:58.440]  I can't wait. This is going to be so wonderful.
[37:58.940 --> 38:01.200]  I text you. You reply.
[38:01.720 --> 38:04.540]  I had gotten a text from Gavin earlier in the day.
[38:04.600 --> 38:05.980]  You're both G's on my phone.
[38:06.140 --> 38:10.180]  You both have the same icon because of that, like the default G Google thing.
[38:10.360 --> 38:16.740]  I accidentally then click Gavin and I sent like seven or eight texts
[38:17.380 --> 38:20.020]  explaining and outlining this idea with a link.
[38:20.420 --> 38:25.900]  And then I realized, oh, fuck, this is I sent all these to Gavin.
[38:26.200 --> 38:28.060]  Too hard to copy and paste back to me.
[38:28.300 --> 38:31.200]  Well, because I thought it'd be funnier on the show to have Gavin
[38:31.200 --> 38:32.940]  then explain to you my idea.
[38:34.060 --> 38:36.780]  But Gavin, could you explain to me Andrew's idea?
[38:36.940 --> 38:39.500]  I've been on I've been waiting for days to hear it.
[38:39.740 --> 38:43.780]  From what I've seen, you watch ten hours of Betty White
[38:44.520 --> 38:46.620]  and you get paid a grand or something.
[38:47.720 --> 38:53.100]  So the idea was we've talked about before on the show budget,
[38:53.300 --> 38:55.740]  porta potty budget, dumb budget. We need a budget.
[38:56.020 --> 39:01.080]  I came across this absurd, this absurd contest,
[39:01.420 --> 39:02.620]  if you want to call it that.
[39:02.660 --> 39:06.980]  It's like Betty White is in no way affiliated with it or endorsed by it.
[39:06.980 --> 39:11.240]  But it's this insurance company that is like, hey, if you can prove
[39:11.240 --> 39:13.060]  you're the biggest Betty White fan,
[39:13.060 --> 39:18.060]  we will give you a thousand dollars and a DVD player and some DVDs.
[39:18.460 --> 39:22.080]  And you have to document yourself watching ten hours of Betty White.
[39:22.400 --> 39:23.860]  And that's the contest.
[39:24.060 --> 39:27.980]  You're being the contest is them trying to find the biggest Betty White fan
[39:27.980 --> 39:33.480]  to then have social media like document their experience of watching this content.
[39:34.240 --> 39:36.460]  I don't think anyone's going to fucking enter that thing.
[39:36.520 --> 39:41.540]  And I feel like we could just take over random contests and win them.
[39:41.540 --> 39:43.120]  And that is how we could fund this show.
[39:43.320 --> 39:44.960]  We just need to win these things.
[39:45.300 --> 39:47.840]  I also thought it'd be really funny if on our YouTube channel,
[39:48.020 --> 39:51.640]  just a random video out of nowhere comes out of one of us
[39:51.640 --> 39:55.160]  talking about how much they love Betty White and why she's so great.
[39:55.580 --> 39:59.300]  And then so like there's a week where the audience will be like, what is why is
[39:59.300 --> 40:03.580]  Geoff or whatever talking about Betty White with like no context?
[40:03.760 --> 40:06.000]  So we'd have to do is make that before this comes out.
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.920]  All we would have to do is before the contest ends on the 22nd for submission.
[40:10.920 --> 40:14.440]  So the audience in no way can impact this in any way.
[40:14.560 --> 40:15.180]  They can't apply.
[40:15.280 --> 40:16.740]  They will hear after the fact.
[40:17.220 --> 40:18.620]  And I don't think anyone will apply.
[40:18.720 --> 40:22.300]  So I think if we apply and include a video of the application,
[40:22.300 --> 40:25.940]  I think we might be able to win the Betty White Dream Job Contest.
[40:26.600 --> 40:28.560]  I've I've sounds awesome to me.
[40:28.700 --> 40:33.200]  I like the idea of entering random contests that nobody else enters and wins.
[40:33.320 --> 40:36.300]  I know we know somebody associated with Rooster Teeth
[40:36.300 --> 40:38.240]  who used to do that and had a lot of success with it.
[40:38.240 --> 40:41.740]  I remember I listened to a like a game podcast
[40:41.740 --> 40:45.280]  and they talked about how running like a gaming website in the mid 2000s.
[40:45.360 --> 40:47.660]  They used to have these huge contests where it was like,
[40:47.680 --> 40:53.280]  if you could submit in the greatest like PSP guide or whatever for this thing,
[40:53.400 --> 40:56.280]  you will win a car through this promo that they're doing.
[40:56.420 --> 40:59.620]  And nobody had the ability to capture footage at that point.
[40:59.620 --> 41:02.260]  Or like just the barriers to entry were so hard.
[41:02.580 --> 41:05.040]  They'd have like four people enter for a new car.
[41:05.160 --> 41:07.440]  And it was just like a constant thing where it's like
[41:07.440 --> 41:08.640]  it was such a small thing.
[41:08.840 --> 41:12.880]  I think if we target these weird, bizarre contests, we can just rack up the wits.
[41:13.140 --> 41:15.180]  I'm just so confused at this contest.
[41:15.400 --> 41:16.400]  Like everyone applies.
[41:16.920 --> 41:20.540]  And if you're like and then they select only one person.
[41:20.980 --> 41:25.540]  Yeah. To watch 10 hours from like various pre-provided DVDs.
[41:26.180 --> 41:27.060]  And then you get a grand.
[41:27.180 --> 41:31.500]  So they all they get out of this is one person doing like a bit
[41:31.500 --> 41:33.000]  of social media about Betty White.
[41:33.420 --> 41:36.660]  Yeah. But what I really love is when you read the details of the contest,
[41:36.660 --> 41:41.380]  there's a very clear line that Betty White has no affiliation or support of this.
[41:41.800 --> 41:43.960]  She had no way endorses this in any way.
[41:44.240 --> 41:47.020]  I don't know how they came to the decision of doing this Betty White thing,
[41:47.260 --> 41:48.820]  but I don't think anyone will enter.
[41:49.180 --> 41:51.120]  And I think we could take it over.
[41:51.240 --> 41:55.640]  And even if we don't get selected, I think we could hijack the Betty White thing.
[41:55.700 --> 41:59.340]  If they've got like a hashtag or whatever, we could just take over the hashtag.
[41:59.660 --> 42:02.140]  I feel like I could easily watch 10 hours of Golden Girls.
[42:02.320 --> 42:03.000]  That's some good shit.
[42:03.360 --> 42:04.800]  Is that your favorite Betty White content?
[42:04.800 --> 42:06.580]  That's the only Betty White I've seen.
[42:06.880 --> 42:08.320]  What's better than Golden Girls?
[42:08.400 --> 42:09.860]  It's one of the best shows of all time.
[42:10.100 --> 42:11.620]  Lake Placid. Great.
[42:11.800 --> 42:13.120]  That's a that's a good movie.
[42:13.220 --> 42:14.880]  But what are you going to watch Lake Placid six times?
[42:15.080 --> 42:17.460]  I could easily watch Lake Placid six times.
[42:17.540 --> 42:19.220]  She's feeding the fucking thing.
[42:19.240 --> 42:22.520]  Well, don't do don't spoil the fucking movie for people who haven't seen it.
[42:22.840 --> 42:24.260]  Oh, I'm sorry. You haven't had time.
[42:24.380 --> 42:25.940]  No. Yeah. Fucking Placid.
[42:26.400 --> 42:28.920]  Lake Placid is is a very good movie.
[42:28.960 --> 42:30.660]  It's also got what's his face in it?
[42:31.240 --> 42:32.620]  Oliver is Oliver Platt.
[42:32.760 --> 42:34.180]  Oliver Platt. And that. Yeah. Yeah.
[42:34.180 --> 42:35.460]  He's great in it.
[42:35.580 --> 42:37.700]  Yeah. I don't know if it's an intentional.
[42:37.920 --> 42:41.340]  And it must be like the greatest gag in that movie is they keep some
[42:41.340 --> 42:44.620]  one of the characters keeps falling into traps set for the crocodile
[42:44.620 --> 42:46.520]  or whatever alligator.
[42:47.120 --> 42:49.320]  What is it? Is it crocodile or alligator?
[42:49.640 --> 42:51.560]  I never know. I always confuse that.
[42:51.880 --> 42:53.600]  It's probably an alligator because I think it's freshwater.
[42:54.160 --> 42:55.760]  Yeah. Because it's Lake Placid.
[42:55.860 --> 42:58.740]  People always try to figure out if it's an alligator or a crocodile.
[42:58.940 --> 43:00.960]  In what situation does it ever matter?
[43:01.480 --> 43:02.460]  That's a great point, too, Gav.
[43:02.460 --> 43:04.000]  Crocodiles are bigger than alligators.
[43:04.200 --> 43:05.240]  That's the only difference.
[43:05.380 --> 43:07.260]  I mean, they'll both rip your arm off.
[43:07.420 --> 43:08.760]  Yeah, they I think they. Yeah.
[43:09.020 --> 43:10.540]  I feel like Jeopardy would matter.
[43:11.280 --> 43:13.760]  Trivia shows side of that.
[43:13.780 --> 43:15.960]  I guess if Mayim Balik is asking you, it matters.
[43:19.060 --> 43:21.440]  Could we can we sign up for this?
[43:21.840 --> 43:23.060]  Can we just enter the big light?
[43:23.440 --> 43:24.140]  Who's stopping us?
[43:24.400 --> 43:27.240]  I can't. Well, I can't do it because it has to be a U.S.
[43:27.540 --> 43:29.360]  as somebody in the U.S. I'm blocked.
[43:29.620 --> 43:31.280]  We'll talk to producer Eric. He'll do it.
[43:31.280 --> 43:33.060]  Eric, are you going to sign up for us?
[43:33.120 --> 43:34.300]  Are you going to be our Betty White ambassador?
[43:34.700 --> 43:36.840]  No, Nick can do it. He's he's not busy.
[43:37.120 --> 43:38.460]  Oh, there you go. Yeah.
[43:39.020 --> 43:42.120]  Do you think you're less you're more busy than Nick?
[43:44.420 --> 43:45.300]  Yeah, immediately.
[43:48.100 --> 43:49.760]  Nick says, Are you sure?
[43:50.020 --> 43:50.980]  Well, wait a second.
[43:51.340 --> 43:54.880]  Everyone was just talking about the joy of being able to spend 10 hours
[43:54.880 --> 43:55.860]  watching Betty White.
[43:55.920 --> 43:58.600]  And then when it comes time to sign up, everyone is suddenly busy.
[43:58.600 --> 44:01.480]  I'll watch Betty White. I'll watch the Betty White.
[44:01.620 --> 44:04.660]  I just don't think I can pull off a good video explaining why I love Betty White.
[44:04.900 --> 44:08.000]  Yeah, well, I'll fill out the form on your behalf, Geoff.
[44:08.080 --> 44:08.640]  Is that OK?
[44:09.040 --> 44:14.120]  Can I? So I understand like your your your grand vision here
[44:14.120 --> 44:18.540]  is for me to enter a contest for you to win for us to win.
[44:18.700 --> 44:22.340]  No, the show we've spent the money on the budget for the show.
[44:22.680 --> 44:24.940]  This is how we enter the con.
[44:24.940 --> 44:29.520]  We enter in the contest and then you spend the money that we win,
[44:29.640 --> 44:30.580]  that you don't.
[44:30.780 --> 44:31.860]  No, no, we all.
[44:32.180 --> 44:33.740]  It becomes the community pool.
[44:33.900 --> 44:35.300]  This is a port of view it this way.
[44:35.360 --> 44:37.500]  We're winning a port-a-potty, essentially, is the prize.
[44:37.500 --> 44:41.180]  This is great because we don't ever get given money for anything.
[44:41.180 --> 44:44.820]  And all of the sales money for the billion ad reads on these videos
[44:44.820 --> 44:48.460]  and an audio files don't come to us either.
[44:48.920 --> 44:50.460]  They all go in the pocket of sales.
[44:50.800 --> 44:53.860]  This could be it's all going to be contest winning budget.
[44:53.860 --> 44:55.080]  This is interesting.
[44:55.300 --> 44:57.360]  This is that's a really good way to look at it, Gav.
[44:57.620 --> 45:00.900]  Yeah. What could we do with a thousand dollars after taxes?
[45:03.080 --> 45:05.080]  What can we do with seven hundred dollars?
[45:06.440 --> 45:07.520]  It's prize winning.
[45:07.620 --> 45:08.900]  So it's probably taxed to the moon.
[45:09.120 --> 45:11.380]  What can we do with six hundred and thirty dollars?
[45:15.290 --> 45:16.870]  This is just a start.
[45:16.970 --> 45:18.410]  OK, we start cleaning up.
[45:18.610 --> 45:20.690]  We start thinking like we could buy a surfboard.
[45:20.810 --> 45:22.670]  What could I buy a surfboard once for six hundred bucks?
[45:22.930 --> 45:24.210]  Really? They probably cost about that.
[45:24.250 --> 45:25.130]  We could buy a surfboard.
[45:25.130 --> 45:27.690]  I'm not being still. I'm not trying to be a dickhead here.
[45:27.770 --> 45:28.330]  I'm being serious.
[45:28.430 --> 45:30.630]  I'm trying to think of what we could spend six hundred, seven hundred dollars on.
[45:30.710 --> 45:31.150]  There's a lot.
[45:31.370 --> 45:32.450]  You could repair your bike.
[45:33.410 --> 45:34.970]  Uh, I don't talk about it.
[45:35.190 --> 45:38.270]  Oh, I don't I don't want to open up that whole can of worms.
[45:38.370 --> 45:39.970]  I got bike. I got bike problems, man.
[45:40.370 --> 45:42.890]  Jet ski rental. That'll that'll that'll that's three.
[45:43.870 --> 45:46.590]  Six hundred bucks would be two jet skis for three hours.
[45:47.310 --> 45:48.950]  Right. We could do that.
[45:49.530 --> 45:50.150]  That'd be pretty good.
[45:50.310 --> 45:50.830]  That'd be pretty good.
[45:51.310 --> 45:52.590]  Or three jet skis for two hours.
[45:52.710 --> 45:53.330]  That might be even better.
[45:53.330 --> 45:55.090]  Oh, yeah. Then Andrew could have his own.
[45:55.470 --> 45:55.670]  Absolutely.
[45:56.270 --> 45:57.450]  Oh, I like this.
[45:57.530 --> 45:58.750]  I assume you don't want to share with me.
[45:58.770 --> 46:00.330]  This could fund the joust.
[46:00.770 --> 46:01.650]  That's what I'm saying.
[46:02.150 --> 46:03.270]  That's a great idea, Nick.
[46:04.670 --> 46:05.970]  Betty White's joust fund.
[46:07.010 --> 46:09.550]  Oh, we have to call it the regulation.
[46:09.750 --> 46:11.330]  Betty White joust fund.
[46:11.630 --> 46:12.770]  Something along those lines.
[46:13.310 --> 46:14.810]  If we can, I will.
[46:14.830 --> 46:19.590]  I will recant now and say if I don't like the idea of the joust,
[46:19.630 --> 46:23.050]  but if the Betty White contest does fund it,
[46:23.050 --> 46:26.710]  then I'm on board and we'll do whatever it takes in order to win this money.
[46:26.890 --> 46:30.330]  I just love the idea of this company sending the check.
[46:33.270 --> 46:37.450]  The Betty White Joust Fund at F*** Face, a subsidiary of Uniform.
[46:42.150 --> 46:46.870]  Well, technically, it's a subsidiary of Fluke Face, which is an arm of Uniform.
[46:47.110 --> 46:49.890]  Uniform. Combining the power of one with the fabric of the form. Uniform.
[46:51.070 --> 46:55.390]  So now we just need a video, Geoff, explaining why Betty White is so great.
[46:55.470 --> 46:58.030]  We can do that, but we need to watch the 10 hours of content first.
[46:58.210 --> 46:59.090]  I was going to say...
[46:59.090 --> 47:00.750]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[47:01.650 --> 47:07.550]  Yeah, but don't you need to watch some content to remind yourself of how great Betty White is?
[47:07.650 --> 47:12.430]  You think you're just going to spit hot Betty White takes from the hip
[47:12.430 --> 47:16.170]  without, like, refamiliarizing yourself with any of her content?
[47:16.430 --> 47:19.030]  You're going to have to dip your toe into Betty White a little bit
[47:19.030 --> 47:20.290]  before you make the video.
[47:22.150 --> 47:23.550]  I'm not sure about that.
[47:24.450 --> 47:25.150]  I don't know.
[47:25.690 --> 47:29.290]  I mean, if only to watch your favorite scene of Lake Placid
[47:29.290 --> 47:31.190]  so you can quote a moment.
[47:31.550 --> 47:33.670]  You don't want to sound like your idea.
[47:33.790 --> 47:36.630]  All right. Your idea is very sound and very good.
[47:36.630 --> 47:38.950]  And even though I am operating at about a four,
[47:39.050 --> 47:43.050]  I think I'm down to about 36% right now and just loopy as f***.
[47:43.190 --> 47:46.490]  Even even at this diminished capacity, I can see the potential.
[47:46.690 --> 47:48.350]  I think it's a fantastic idea.
[47:48.350 --> 47:52.790]  But I think if you want to like, I do think we should enter this.
[47:52.870 --> 47:54.110]  I do think we should try to win.
[47:54.510 --> 47:56.170]  I do think there won't be a ton of people.
[47:56.390 --> 47:59.590]  I also don't think it'll be a walk through the park.
[47:59.690 --> 48:03.270]  I do think other people will and will have to put some level of effort in.
[48:03.570 --> 48:06.930]  And I think that we're going to have to come across as actual Betty White fans.
[48:07.490 --> 48:08.530]  I agree with all that.
[48:08.950 --> 48:11.990]  OK, I mean, could we all dress up as the Golden Girls?
[48:12.190 --> 48:13.030]  That's an idea.
[48:13.210 --> 48:14.750]  See, that's thinking outside the box.
[48:15.290 --> 48:16.510]  That does. I don't know how.
[48:16.510 --> 48:18.550]  There's no way I could submit that in the.
[48:18.630 --> 48:19.510]  I want to be Sophia.
[48:19.870 --> 48:21.410]  What if we dress up instead?
[48:21.550 --> 48:23.510]  Well, you know, we can dress up as our favorite Golden Girls,
[48:23.570 --> 48:24.570]  but then it's about more than Betty.
[48:24.870 --> 48:28.250]  What if we all dress up as our favorite Betty White from her career?
[48:28.770 --> 48:31.610]  Like you get like Gavin, you could be Rose Nylon, right?
[48:31.730 --> 48:35.590]  OK, and Andrew, you could be the crocodile
[48:35.990 --> 48:38.930]  or the alligator or Betty White from Lake Placid.
[48:39.290 --> 48:42.150]  And I'll pick up Betty White from some other like what is it?
[48:42.190 --> 48:45.770]  It's a it's a it's what is that show she had?
[48:45.770 --> 48:47.110]  It's like hot and.
[48:47.970 --> 48:48.690]  Oh, hot in Cleveland.
[48:48.910 --> 48:50.410]  Hot in Cleveland. Never seen it.
[48:50.510 --> 48:53.710]  But I'll familiarize myself with hot in Cleveland and I'll be that Betty White
[48:53.710 --> 48:55.170]  character. I love this.
[48:55.290 --> 48:56.750]  This is I'm glad that there's support.
[48:57.010 --> 49:00.350]  I wish that I would have texted the right person the entire way through yesterday.
[49:00.930 --> 49:04.730]  Maybe I'll hold up a collection of things that Betty White is older than,
[49:05.190 --> 49:06.890]  such as the ballpoint pen.
[49:07.410 --> 49:09.650]  That's why I don't why I don't understand.
[49:10.270 --> 49:10.950]  Yeah. Why? What?
[49:11.070 --> 49:11.930]  What else came out?
[49:12.070 --> 49:13.530]  No, that's that's a great thing.
[49:13.530 --> 49:14.470]  No, here's your take on this.
[49:14.690 --> 49:15.790]  Electric can opener.
[49:16.550 --> 49:18.270]  Betty White. Here's your thing right now.
[49:18.590 --> 49:19.590]  Betty White. Country music.
[49:20.050 --> 49:25.870]  Betty White is such an institutional like such a a national
[49:28.150 --> 49:29.290]  what's the word I'm looking for here?
[49:29.750 --> 49:31.390]  Treasure. A national treasure.
[49:31.530 --> 49:33.210]  She should be when she dies.
[49:33.550 --> 49:37.010]  There should be a she she should be interned in the Smithsonian.
[49:37.550 --> 49:41.370]  Her career has she is still at the top of her game at 90 X years old.
[49:41.370 --> 49:44.250]  Right. And she her career has spanned so much time.
[49:44.690 --> 49:49.710]  She has been a famous she's been entertaining millions of audience members
[49:49.710 --> 49:54.730]  since before the electric can opener, since before the ballpoint pen.
[49:54.970 --> 49:59.470]  These are great ways to show not only the longevity of her brilliant career,
[49:59.550 --> 50:01.550]  but our knowledge of it.
[50:01.830 --> 50:03.330]  This is what's going to win us the contest.
[50:03.490 --> 50:04.630]  Shit like that, Gavin.
[50:04.770 --> 50:05.670]  That's smart.
[50:06.010 --> 50:08.490]  Dude, number one, sliced bread.
[50:08.950 --> 50:10.590]  She's older than sliced bread.
[50:10.590 --> 50:13.450]  That means sliced bread is the best thing since Betty White.
[50:13.870 --> 50:15.810]  Sliced bread is the best thing since Betty White.
[50:15.950 --> 50:17.770]  That's a T-shirt.
[50:20.730 --> 50:22.650]  Other people must have made that observation.
[50:25.650 --> 50:27.490]  Why are we not mentioning the high five?
[50:27.950 --> 50:28.910]  And we're just talking about things.
[50:29.030 --> 50:31.090]  She's older than she's way older than I.
[50:31.150 --> 50:33.450]  Geoff's older than I five, according to your bullshit.
[50:33.870 --> 50:34.850]  Yeah, it's not my bullshit.
[50:35.030 --> 50:36.390]  It's just a historic fact.
[50:36.950 --> 50:37.690]  You don't know about history.
[50:38.150 --> 50:39.410]  Coming at Dusty Baker.
[50:39.950 --> 50:41.410]  He didn't know what to do, Gavin.
[50:41.530 --> 50:44.410]  Can you imagine the pressure of seeing a hand and not knowing what to do with it?
[50:46.030 --> 50:47.870]  Your product didn't exist yet.
[50:50.650 --> 50:55.650]  Oh, oh, speaking of things that Betty White is older than,
[50:56.210 --> 51:00.290]  if we ever this is the problem with like not all the content that I have.
[51:00.390 --> 51:03.170]  We haven't touched anything on my list, nor do I think we will.
[51:03.370 --> 51:05.290]  But a lot of it isn't evergreen.
[51:05.410 --> 51:09.090]  And one of those things is, Andrew, your fucking nugget challenge
[51:09.410 --> 51:11.050]  I pulled some stats.
[51:11.170 --> 51:14.990]  I don't know if they're relevant anymore, but I pulled some stats of like all time.
[51:15.810 --> 51:18.550]  Oh, my God. You OK?
[51:19.090 --> 51:20.810]  I how do I undo?
[51:21.410 --> 51:24.190]  I just wanted all of my notes.
[51:29.140 --> 51:31.760]  What in the fuck just are you on your phone?
[51:32.720 --> 51:34.240]  OK, I got it back. OK, that was weird.
[51:36.920 --> 51:39.060]  Just deleted face by accident.
[51:39.060 --> 51:40.820]  Yeah, I wanted to list.
[51:41.280 --> 51:43.080]  Well, like I said, guys, diminished capacity.
[51:43.440 --> 51:45.700]  And let's be honest, you've known me for a long time.
[51:45.760 --> 51:47.620]  My capacity hasn't been minished.
[51:48.480 --> 51:50.500]  Like at my best, I'm never very minish.
[51:52.260 --> 51:55.100]  So we want to look at best performances of all time.
[51:55.180 --> 51:58.720]  Now, obviously, Wilt Chamberlain has the highest scoring game of all time.
[51:58.760 --> 52:02.520]  He scored 100 points in 1961 versus the Knicks.
[52:03.100 --> 52:08.140]  The second highest points total by NBA players, Kobe Bryant with 81.
[52:08.600 --> 52:11.820]  Then we have some other people like I'd never heard of David Thompson.
[52:12.300 --> 52:13.200]  He was a Denver.
[52:13.200 --> 52:17.680]  He was a Denver Nugget, though, and he scored 73 points.
[52:17.840 --> 52:21.660]  Although I'm not sure if that's correct, because that's different on my other list.
[52:21.920 --> 52:28.780]  Anyway, so but that puts you in the same category as Michael Jordan.
[52:28.900 --> 52:30.120]  His high career high 69.
[52:30.620 --> 52:32.360]  Pistol Pete Maravich 68.
[52:32.920 --> 52:35.920]  Devin Booker had that terrible game with 70 against the Celtics.
[52:35.980 --> 52:37.500]  Nobody wants to remember that anyway.
[52:37.500 --> 52:40.300]  And then a bunch of Wilt Chamberlain doing it over and over and over and over again.
[52:40.640 --> 52:42.860]  But you scored what, 62 was where you were, Geoff?
[52:42.980 --> 52:45.500]  Or no, I was.
[52:45.640 --> 52:46.780]  I think I was like 67.
[52:47.240 --> 52:48.740]  No, you were in the 60s. You were in the 60s.
[52:48.740 --> 52:49.760]  I was in the 60s.
[52:49.800 --> 52:51.040]  It was 62 or 67.
[52:51.580 --> 52:54.880]  OK, I kind of blocked that whole thing from my memory.
[52:55.220 --> 52:58.920]  You have scored more points in your one NBA game
[53:00.240 --> 53:03.440]  than Stephen Curry, whose career high is only 62.
[53:04.040 --> 53:06.360]  Carmelo Anthony, career high is only 62.
[53:06.780 --> 53:09.780]  The great Jason McGrady, only 62.
[53:09.980 --> 53:13.380]  Damian Lillard has only scored 61 points in his career.
[53:13.860 --> 53:17.420]  James Harden has only scored 61 points in his career.
[53:17.480 --> 53:18.120]  Did it twice, though.
[53:18.440 --> 53:24.040]  LeBron James, highest scoring game of his NBA career, 61 points.
[53:24.500 --> 53:29.660]  Those are all people you bested in your first and only NBA game.
[53:29.800 --> 53:32.360]  That is, Eric is right, that is rarefied error.
[53:32.700 --> 53:35.580]  Is that I am more qualified than LeBron
[53:35.580 --> 53:37.320]  James to make another Space Jam movie?
[53:37.680 --> 53:41.460]  If they make a Space Jam three, my credentials are more deserving
[53:41.460 --> 53:43.220]  than whatever he's done in his career.
[53:43.220 --> 53:44.720]  They're definitely up there.
[53:44.860 --> 53:48.980]  I mean, that's a to say that's an impressive list is is an understatement.
[53:49.420 --> 53:52.260]  Not only that, I know this might be where I saw it.
[53:52.480 --> 53:56.240]  According to according to the Internet, the highest scoring regular season
[53:56.240 --> 53:59.380]  game by a Denver Nugget was Kiki Vanderwey.
[53:59.720 --> 54:01.120]  He scored 51 points.
[54:01.380 --> 54:03.740]  So you've kicked the shit out of you.
[54:03.740 --> 54:07.260]  You trout like the Nuggets and the history of their franchise
[54:07.260 --> 54:10.140]  have nobody that they can put up against you.
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.140]  Eric just said Andrew's a hell of an athlete.
[54:13.320 --> 54:15.340]  You guys haven't even seen me do the sewing machine yet.
[54:15.520 --> 54:16.860]  That's really going to blow some minds.
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  There's some heads.
[54:18.380 --> 54:20.720]  I don't know if you're a hell of an athlete, but you're a hell of an eat.
[54:21.400 --> 54:25.280]  I'm telling you, the sewing machine is a word I hope I just made up.
[54:25.400 --> 54:28.040]  Eat fleet, eat fleet, eat fleet.
[54:28.600 --> 54:30.780]  But I don't I feel like I'm a terrible athlete.
[54:31.560 --> 54:32.960]  Why? Why do you think you're a terrible athlete?
[54:32.960 --> 54:36.140]  Because going against any of the people that are eathletes,
[54:36.240 --> 54:39.800]  you know, like a Joey Chestnut, a Kobayashi, whatever, I got no chance.
[54:39.920 --> 54:43.740]  But I feel like going against athletes and the athletic world.
[54:44.020 --> 54:45.440]  My numbers are pretty good.
[54:46.180 --> 54:48.200]  I feel like I have to stay in the athlete territory.
[54:48.320 --> 54:51.200]  The moment I go in the eathlete, I'm at the bottom of the pile.
[54:51.720 --> 54:56.020]  Dude, Devin Booker, to my knowledge, Devin Booker is the only player
[54:56.020 --> 54:58.860]  playing in the NBA right now who has outscored you.
[54:59.300 --> 55:00.260]  That's fucking crazy.
[55:00.720 --> 55:01.620]  How many did he get?
[55:01.640 --> 55:03.640]  He got 70 against the Celtics like three years ago.
[55:03.640 --> 55:07.260]  I can fucking, I can, I'll fucking destroy Devin Booker.
[55:07.900 --> 55:08.680]  I'll take him out.
[55:08.880 --> 55:10.960]  But can you, though, because you stopped shy of that.
[55:11.420 --> 55:14.940]  Yeah, but there's a difference mentally when you're trying to eat
[55:15.500 --> 55:17.760]  120 nuggets as opposed to 71.
[55:18.240 --> 55:20.320]  That's a big gap. That's a big difference.
[55:20.420 --> 55:21.540]  I could definitely use 71.
[55:22.220 --> 55:23.320]  I can make that work.
[55:23.940 --> 55:25.480]  And we're not doing this for a while.
[55:25.660 --> 55:27.020]  This is going to be months from now.
[55:27.080 --> 55:29.660]  I need to get back into nugget shape, nugget form,
[55:29.660 --> 55:32.740]  nugget mentality, need to work my way back.
[55:32.860 --> 55:34.200]  It takes a lot to do these.
[55:34.820 --> 55:37.180]  And what kind of things will you be doing to prepare?
[55:37.740 --> 55:38.500]  Absolutely nothing.
[55:38.660 --> 55:40.940]  It's just more of a time and forgetting how bad it was.
[55:41.660 --> 55:46.040]  Yeah, just like once enough time passes where I fully forget everything.
[55:46.540 --> 55:49.880]  And then there will be an evening where I'm like, fucking Devin Booker's going down.
[55:50.080 --> 55:51.920]  I'm going to wake up at 4 a.m.
[55:51.920 --> 55:54.640]  one day and just say, Devin Booker's time is over.
[55:55.160 --> 55:56.280]  I am dethroning Devin Booker.
[55:56.660 --> 55:59.500]  Yeah, you got to you got to wait for the nugget confidence to hit you.
[55:59.660 --> 56:02.160]  I understand that. Yeah, you're cozy in bed.
[56:02.200 --> 56:03.640]  And then you'll think now's the time.
[56:04.120 --> 56:05.400]  Should I get up and do nuggets?
[56:05.980 --> 56:08.480]  Oh, man, the ceiling nuggets all over myself.
[56:08.660 --> 56:11.880]  Do you know Eric's letting us giving us the wrap up sign?
[56:11.940 --> 56:13.240]  And we got to because we got to record another one.
[56:13.280 --> 56:13.780]  I'll be honest with you.
[56:13.800 --> 56:15.520]  I didn't know if I was going to make it to the next one.
[56:15.560 --> 56:17.960]  But I the last like five minutes, I've started to feel a little better.
[56:18.960 --> 56:19.840]  So maybe I can.
[56:20.320 --> 56:23.040]  I do want to let you guys know on something that we missed this week
[56:23.040 --> 56:25.100]  that I think could have been spectacular.
[56:26.080 --> 56:28.900]  OK, but Eric shot it down tomorrow.
[56:28.900 --> 56:32.700]  As we as we know, I'm getting my colonoscopy to get my colonoscopy.
[56:32.960 --> 56:35.080]  If you've never gotten one, it's not a fun process.
[56:35.280 --> 56:36.660]  You can't eat for a bunch of days.
[56:36.760 --> 56:38.120]  You get on a liquid diet.
[56:38.480 --> 56:40.420]  You have to drink a bunch of weird shit that tastes gross,
[56:40.420 --> 56:43.140]  that makes you shit and puke constantly.
[56:43.140 --> 56:45.040]  I have to drink like after we're done.
[56:45.180 --> 56:50.040]  I have to go drink 46 ounces of liquid in like an hour.
[56:50.060 --> 56:52.240]  Is that just so they meet no resistance on the way up?
[56:52.520 --> 56:56.200]  Well, you have to rest your colon so you can't have any food go through
[56:56.640 --> 56:58.720]  that can agitate it or fill it up.
[56:58.860 --> 57:01.220]  In my in my case, I, you know, I have diverticulosis.
[57:01.380 --> 57:02.660]  So I have those little pockets all over.
[57:02.820 --> 57:06.640]  So you got to flush out your system, like kind of shock it out.
[57:06.900 --> 57:10.080]  And then and then you have to keep it clean and clear
[57:10.080 --> 57:13.220]  because even like colored food, anything with a dye,
[57:13.320 --> 57:16.400]  like like red Gatorade can look like blood to a camera.
[57:16.540 --> 57:18.580]  And so it's just it's not a fun process.
[57:18.740 --> 57:22.780]  And then they make you take a bunch of special liquids that extra clear you out.
[57:22.880 --> 57:25.720]  Right. Like like you've never taken a laxative
[57:25.720 --> 57:28.740]  like you've taken when you go for a colonoscopy anyway.
[57:29.600 --> 57:33.200]  It's like Nick says awful like he's I'm assuming Nick has had a colonoscopy before.
[57:33.340 --> 57:34.520]  I have as well. This is my second.
[57:35.020 --> 57:36.280]  So it's not my first rodeo.
[57:36.560 --> 57:37.480]  I kind of know what to expect.
[57:38.580 --> 57:40.340]  But I thought it would be great.
[57:40.460 --> 57:42.220]  We need to do a break shit face break shit.
[57:42.360 --> 57:44.960]  I wanted to do it tomorrow after the colonoscopy.
[57:45.100 --> 57:50.680]  I wanted to go from the hospital to the break shit all looped up on the casino.
[57:50.880 --> 57:52.920]  They put they knock me out. Right.
[57:52.920 --> 57:54.080]  Like they give you drugs.
[57:54.200 --> 57:55.260]  I'm all loopy.
[57:55.260 --> 57:56.640]  I'm all fucking dumb.
[57:57.660 --> 57:58.980]  I'll be it's like a truth serum.
[57:59.100 --> 58:01.980]  I won't be able to like I would have just been wackadoo for hours.
[58:02.260 --> 58:04.120]  And Eric was like, absolutely not.
[58:04.760 --> 58:06.460]  I was ready to do it.
[58:07.000 --> 58:07.740]  He's right there.
[58:07.840 --> 58:14.200]  There is no way that I'm going to put Geoff on camera
[58:15.740 --> 58:18.200]  after an outpatient surgery.
[58:18.860 --> 58:19.740]  They already did it.
[58:20.040 --> 58:22.060]  Well, 10 years ago, I did it 10 years.
[58:22.060 --> 58:25.400]  Yeah, I am not doing that.
[58:27.840 --> 58:29.500]  I am not doing that.
[58:29.760 --> 58:33.340]  That's no, we're not doing it tomorrow after he gets all the stuff
[58:33.860 --> 58:37.700]  inside of him and then it's no, no, absolutely not.
[58:37.780 --> 58:38.620]  No, no.
[58:38.940 --> 58:42.120]  Geoff carries that show and goes like, here's interesting facts about the cards.
[58:42.260 --> 58:43.880]  I don't even know what it would be.
[58:44.160 --> 58:45.100]  Well, I don't either.
[58:45.320 --> 58:46.740]  That's what would be so much fun.
[58:47.300 --> 58:49.740]  Pack a card and put it in a dollop of drool.
[58:49.740 --> 58:55.640]  I have no idea what facts when I come up with fucking blitz
[58:55.640 --> 58:58.000]  that on my mind on on hospital drugs.
[58:58.060 --> 58:59.660]  I have no it would have been so much fun.
[58:59.960 --> 59:01.080]  But I respect that.
[59:01.420 --> 59:03.120]  Ultimately, I think Eric's looking out for me.
[59:03.360 --> 59:06.100]  And I think he's maybe not necessarily looking for the show
[59:06.100 --> 59:07.720]  because I think it would be great for the show.
[59:07.720 --> 59:09.840]  But I do appreciate Eric looking out for me.
[59:09.900 --> 59:12.500]  But I also would love to have done it.
[59:13.180 --> 59:13.580]  Insane.
[59:14.120 --> 59:14.880]  That would have been great.
[59:15.820 --> 59:16.220]  Insane.
[59:16.240 --> 59:17.700]  You know, show must go on and on.
[59:17.700 --> 59:18.740]  It does.
[59:18.940 --> 59:21.980]  Should we talk about the jet ski stuff?
[59:22.220 --> 59:23.400]  You're the big merch.
[59:23.760 --> 59:24.580]  Oh, we talked about that.
[59:24.580 --> 59:25.660]  I don't think we have.
[59:25.780 --> 59:27.980]  Let's say, why don't you cover that and then we'll wrap this up.
[59:28.020 --> 59:31.580]  OK, well, I mean, I feel like it's really you as the big jet ski guy.
[59:31.660 --> 59:32.440]  I was excited to share with you.
[59:32.520 --> 59:34.440]  Did you see? I'd be shocked if you did.
[59:34.580 --> 59:36.440]  This is a big week for jet ski news.
[59:36.880 --> 59:38.060]  It is a great jet ski week.
[59:38.220 --> 59:39.340]  Is it a good story?
[59:39.400 --> 59:40.760]  There's a big story. I'll drop in the chat.
[59:40.980 --> 59:41.840]  There are some farmers.
[59:41.920 --> 59:43.720]  There's flooding in B.C. right now.
[59:44.120 --> 59:45.420]  Farmers hopped on some jet ski.
[59:45.500 --> 59:46.240]  Save some cows.
[59:46.240 --> 59:48.140]  Oh, my God.
[59:49.540 --> 59:51.680]  Wait, how do you say, how do you get a cow on a jet ski?
[59:52.080 --> 59:52.700]  Are they towing the cows?
[59:52.700 --> 59:53.580]  No, they didn't put the cow.
[59:53.700 --> 59:56.280]  No, they were like guiding them using the jet skis.
[59:56.280 --> 59:56.700]  Oh, they were herding.
[59:57.540 --> 59:59.020]  Yeah, they were herding them.
[59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.360]  They were sheep jet skis.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:06.020]  Yeah, when we go jet skiing, we should play a game of chase
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.720]  where one of us is dressed up as a sheep and the other is dressed as a cow.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.640]  I mean, Geoff did something similar instead of a cow, though.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.940]  It was a dead bloated deer.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.420]  That's so gross.
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.700]  It was a great week for jet skis.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.500]  And we have jet ski merch coming out on November 29th.
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.200]  Yeah, I believe.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:27.720]  Celebrate the cows.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:34.160]  Buy jet ski merchandise for face on where to fucking go.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.640]  On November 29th at 10 a.m.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.960]  Central Standard Time.
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:38.760]  Cyber Monday.
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:44.760]  Fill up your cyber coffers with jet ski related merchandise.
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:51.980]  And and pay homage to those brave farmers in Canada who saved those cows with the power.
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:55.640]  That is exactly why we're doing jet ski merch.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.760]  It is to honor the Canadian farmer.
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:02.400]  Yes, there's no history or appreciation for jet skis on this show.
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.520]  I still haven't.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.260]  I still haven't been on a jet ski.
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.300]  That is a good moment.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.560]  That is a moment I'm excited to experience.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.020]  I'm ready for my life to change.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.740]  Do you think you'll go 60 miles an hour?
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:16.980]  I think I will probably have an experience like you did, where I will be just like
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:21.740]  doing little little speed, little like just little crawling almost across the water,
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.540]  and then I'll get into it and we'll be we'll be flying.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:29.360]  In other merch news, scrumping is is dead, apparently, according to the merch channel.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.100]  It is.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:33.000]  All the scrumping signs, no scrumping signs are sold out.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.940]  Yeah, they were like fucking gone.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:35.760]  See ya.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.120]  I guess that's it for that.
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.160]  They were made out of plastic.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:42.140]  I was imagining a nice solid metal sign.
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.800]  Was it a plastic sign?
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:52.040]  Apparently it was a plastic no scrumping sign, which originally greatly disappointed
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.420]  me because I never actually touched one.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:56.120]  But then I just thought, well, that's that's definitely f***ed face.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.080]  Well, you know, I see what you're saying.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.080]  In my head, it was like one of those metal signs you would see like posted next to a
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.700]  farm or whatever on the side of the road.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.940]  But I did go to Lowe's the other day and I did look at some signs like no soliciting signs,
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:12.700]  and most of them were were the same material as the as the scrumping sign.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.380]  So I think it might be a situation where the industry has moved on in our in our heads.
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:18.200]  That's very fair.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.940]  I cannot remember the last time I went sign buying.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:28.160]  So I can't say that I'm really regularly in the market and know what the the typical experience
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:28.520]  is.
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:32.140]  The plastic sign is pretty, pretty, pretty commonplace these days.
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:33.440]  Okay, good to know.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.860]  The the that's never mind.
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:36.760]  Never mind.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:41.060]  That being said, I I hope you got one because I don't think we're making any more.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.460]  I think this was a special thing.
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:48.100]  So for all you that didn't get it, I just I pray for your apples.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.820]  Well, what if we brought back all of our limited items for RTX next time we do it?
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.420]  Like unlimited RTX?
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.060]  Yeah, like if.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:56.960]  Wait, what?
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:57.660]  Wait.
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.000]  Well, because they're unlimited for RTX.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.580]  We bring them all back like we're on.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.420]  Well, it'd be it'd be real limited, but at RTX.
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.380]  Still you.
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.440]  So are you are you asking?
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:12.980]  Should we just make all of our collectible items no longer collectible at RTX?
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.580]  Is that what you're presenting?
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:15.660]  Yeah, we're unlimiting it.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.280]  I don't know.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.520]  I just I just worry about our ability to let people know that merch is coming out.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.980]  And by the time we've mentioned it, it's already out.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.480]  We just did a great job.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.820]  We just we let people know about the farmers and the jet skis.
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:27.740]  We're doing great.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:28.760]  Let's just be better.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.120]  Scrumping signs were long out before we mentioned it.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:32.180]  That is true.
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.780]  We could have handled the scrumping thing better.
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:37.900]  We are victims of our own recording schedule more than anything.
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.020]  And your colon.
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:41.240]  And Andrew's and Andrew's illness.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.880]  Yeah, I mean, we we've all had to cancel shows.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:46.080]  How big is a sack, would you say?
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.300]  How many apples do you think should fit in a sack?
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.680]  If you're going to what's the minimum?
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:50.320]  40.
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:51.460]  40.
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.380]  OK, we're on the same.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:59.000]  A sack is probably the biggest size that you can sling over your shoulder
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.480]  and still carry around without being weighed down.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.320]  I agree.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.380]  I think sack.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:06.620]  I think like Santa Claus.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.080]  I think of a giant bag.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.420]  I have a bag with swag written on it.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.140]  I have in my head.
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.520]  And I'll be honest with you, because I can't tell.
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:19.300]  I got, you know, this is an Eric will end, but I'm wrapping up with this
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:22.660]  in the notes that I never got to of the 4000 things to talk about.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.460]  A lot of them are apple related, if I'm being honest with you.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.720]  Oh, and it's given me pause.
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.820]  And I want to ask before we go down this road.
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:36.540]  Are we nearing the end of our apple related content or do we continue down this road?
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.920]  Because I was going to build a prototype for an unscrumpable,
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.640]  like lockable apple sack that you could string over your shoulder.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.020]  That's that holds one apple with a strap and then it's locked in some way.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.600]  So that so it's like an unscrumpable apple you bring on the go with you.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.900]  It's and I say apple sack just because apple sack sounds good,
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:58.340]  but it would only hold one.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:58.800]  It doesn't hold.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.760]  To be honest, that's incredible because my next prototype,
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.640]  I was going to invent the apple pocket.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.840]  What is after the grief I got last week about no one storing an apple in the pocket?
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.560]  I'm going to make a dedicated pocket.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:14.640]  I don't.
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:15.320]  This is.
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:16.160]  I love it.
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:17.780]  We're sticking with apples, baby.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:18.460]  I love it.
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:20.560]  I can't wait.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.560]  Let's do this podcast.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:22.840]  We can talk more about apples.
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:23.740]  Oh, I can't wait.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:24.900]  I just like this.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:28.060]  This is like phase two of the FCU is the apple phase.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.880]  We're done with baseball.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:36.780]  That was phase one.
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.440]  No, baseball will come back.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.340]  You can't give up on Zimmer.
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.320]  Oh, God.
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.420]  In phase one, but he will end it.
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:46.740]  Holy shit.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.620]  No, no more thing.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:49.480]  No more things.
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:50.200]  We got to stop.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:52.040]  We got to stop because I want to talk to you guys about Zimmer.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:52.480]  All right.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.940]  OK, I love you guys.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:57.420]  Hey, if you ever if you ever find yourself.
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.180]  Yeah, I feel a little better than I said.
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.300]  If you ever find yourself thinking like, oh, I haven't talked to Geoff in a year.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.280]  I've ignored him and I've never played video games with him.
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:06.160]  Maybe give him a ring.
[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:06.820]  He's not doing anything.
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:07.180]  I promise.
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:08.480]  Thanks for listening to Face.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.040]  We've only played twice.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:10.360]  Goodbye.
