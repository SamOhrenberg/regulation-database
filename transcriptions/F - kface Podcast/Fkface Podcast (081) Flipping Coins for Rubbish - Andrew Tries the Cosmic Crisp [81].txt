[00:49.370 --> 00:53.530]  I would love to see if the if a tortilla in Canada
[00:53.530 --> 00:58.310]  tastes similar to a tortilla in Texas or if they are the exact same thing
[00:58.310 --> 01:02.370]  or two wildly different things like when Gavin and I had Mexican food in Norway.
[01:04.430 --> 01:06.090]  I don't even know how to describe it.
[01:06.810 --> 01:08.010]  Wasn't that the Netherlands?
[01:08.410 --> 01:10.130]  Yeah, I'm sorry. The Netherlands is the Netherlands.
[01:10.270 --> 01:11.170]  It was in Breda, Netherlands.
[01:11.510 --> 01:12.950]  Yeah, I don't think I've been to Norway.
[01:13.930 --> 01:15.710]  Yeah, it was. I don't think I have either, actually.
[01:15.970 --> 01:20.030]  But if I do go, it's going to be with you and it's going to be to eat Mexican food.
[01:21.810 --> 01:22.930]  Weren't we going to do a whole series
[01:22.930 --> 01:26.090]  about bad Mexican food called Mexicant where we travel?
[01:28.190 --> 01:31.750]  We were going to call it Mexicant or the worst Mexican restaurants on earth.
[01:31.930 --> 01:34.350]  Yeah, that would be up there.
[01:34.370 --> 01:37.670]  That would be a well, it's definitely my top three worst Mexican food.
[01:38.110 --> 01:40.910]  It's just a lot of shitting, which is this show.
[01:41.350 --> 01:43.310]  I feel like the core of that show is just a show.
[01:43.390 --> 01:44.290]  It's a lot of Geoff shitting.
[01:45.010 --> 01:45.970]  And unfortunate wise.
[01:46.810 --> 01:51.330]  Yeah, we I got a burrito at that place because it's like you got to like
[01:51.330 --> 01:53.210]  what's safer than a burrito? Not much, right?
[01:53.610 --> 01:55.030]  And they had chickpeas in it.
[01:55.070 --> 01:57.910]  I remember that very confused by that.
[01:58.130 --> 02:01.510]  And I want to say it is a burrito with chickpeas,
[02:01.530 --> 02:03.710]  which don't exist in burrito form ever.
[02:04.070 --> 02:06.030]  And I want to say it had celery as well.
[02:06.090 --> 02:07.050]  It was fucking bizarre.
[02:07.050 --> 02:09.810]  You think a burrito is safer than a quesadilla?
[02:10.410 --> 02:12.490]  I would say the quesadilla is safer.
[02:12.710 --> 02:14.990]  I would say the quesadilla is the safest Mexican food.
[02:15.330 --> 02:18.990]  I would say quesadilla is safer, but I don't think it's as universally available.
[02:19.230 --> 02:20.390]  I don't think it was on the menu.
[02:21.510 --> 02:22.430]  Yeah, I don't think there was.
[02:22.530 --> 02:24.890]  I don't think they've ever heard of a quesadilla in the Netherlands.
[02:25.050 --> 02:25.790]  No, I don't think so.
[02:26.250 --> 02:28.070]  Huh. That's interesting.
[02:28.670 --> 02:31.510]  Have you ever wondered, like, what is the best restaurant
[02:31.510 --> 02:34.910]  that a different country has of a different country's cuisine?
[02:35.380 --> 02:38.830]  Like, oh, what's the best Italian restaurant in China?
[02:39.790 --> 02:42.650]  Right. Right. Or like, like how
[02:43.380 --> 02:46.890]  the Indian food in London is so fucking good in my experience.
[02:47.210 --> 02:49.430]  Really? What would be the very best of them?
[02:49.470 --> 02:51.950]  Yeah. Or like the Thai food in Australia.
[02:52.190 --> 02:53.930]  Oh, my God. So good there.
[02:54.270 --> 02:57.470]  I remember Anthony Bourdain said that, like, the worst place
[02:57.470 --> 03:00.370]  to get a place's staple food is that place.
[03:00.870 --> 03:04.070]  Like the Philadelphia is the worst place to get a cheesesteak.
[03:04.070 --> 03:05.010]  Like, it's just shitty.
[03:05.250 --> 03:08.250]  Like the surrounding areas that are way better type deal.
[03:08.950 --> 03:11.230]  I don't know. Italian food in Italy is pretty damn great.
[03:11.490 --> 03:13.170]  Yeah, I feel like that's a tough one.
[03:13.290 --> 03:14.330]  I'm not I'm not. I'm not.
[03:14.510 --> 03:17.570]  I'm going to I'm comfortable taking on the Philly cheesesteak.
[03:17.670 --> 03:21.170]  I'm not going to take on Italian food as a whole in Italy.
[03:21.370 --> 03:22.170]  That's too big.
[03:22.230 --> 03:22.790]  I don't know, man.
[03:23.030 --> 03:25.650]  The best Philly cheesesteaks I've ever had have definitely come from Philly.
[03:26.330 --> 03:29.430]  Where have you gotten Philly cheesesteaks from outside of Philly?
[03:29.690 --> 03:31.930]  Is this something you've explored? Quiz notes?
[03:31.930 --> 03:35.050]  I mean, I'm I'm 46, so probably like
[03:35.970 --> 03:38.110]  only 100,000 times throughout my life.
[03:38.270 --> 03:42.030]  I would say a Philly cheesesteak has been more of a staple to my life than a quesadilla.
[03:42.350 --> 03:44.850]  Really? Well, I would not disagree.
[03:44.970 --> 03:46.730]  I don't think I've ever had a Philly cheesesteak.
[03:47.070 --> 03:48.050]  I've had a lot of quesadillas.
[03:48.610 --> 03:51.250]  I like that you disagreed with Geoff's own experience.
[03:51.450 --> 03:51.850]  Yeah, I did.
[03:52.670 --> 03:57.250]  Well, no, he said I thought he was making a general opinion on like, what is more?
[03:57.870 --> 03:58.410]  What is wider?
[03:58.850 --> 04:01.330]  I thought he was talking about his actual life, whether
[04:02.590 --> 04:04.230]  Philly cheesesteak was a bigger staple.
[04:04.370 --> 04:05.970]  You're like, I disagree. I disagree.
[04:06.950 --> 04:10.370]  Well, there's sometimes, you know, things and you don't even know you know them.
[04:12.390 --> 04:14.230]  That's been a thing that's happened recently.
[04:14.410 --> 04:16.530]  I don't know if we want to go into that story.
[04:16.710 --> 04:20.750]  I had Gavin and I were talking about a thing and I knew a piece of information
[04:20.750 --> 04:24.430]  that I didn't know that I knew, and I accidentally said the thing.
[04:24.930 --> 04:25.450]  I revealed it.
[04:25.570 --> 04:28.830]  The most bizarrely circular conversation that ended up with us
[04:28.830 --> 04:32.410]  just like leaving the party chat and going our separate ways.
[04:33.030 --> 04:33.810]  Real quick.
[04:34.210 --> 04:37.210]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Face Podcast.
[04:37.990 --> 04:39.110]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[04:39.270 --> 04:42.910]  With me, as always, Andrew Panton and Gavin Free.
[04:43.150 --> 04:44.070]  In that order.
[04:44.750 --> 04:45.490]  Take it away.
[04:45.950 --> 04:47.030]  Circular conversations.
[04:47.670 --> 04:51.370]  We were well, why don't we let's open this with the same conversation
[04:51.370 --> 04:52.630]  we started with Gavin.
[04:53.190 --> 04:54.370]  I don't know if you've had this talk.
[04:54.410 --> 04:55.550]  Have you had this talk with Geoff?
[04:55.590 --> 04:57.110]  Have you asked him this piece of trivia?
[04:57.110 --> 04:59.690]  Well, no, if it's not on camera, he hasn't.
[04:59.810 --> 05:01.290]  But you have to go back a little bit further than that,
[05:01.330 --> 05:04.370]  because you just randomly asked me, do you have any movie recommendations?
[05:05.830 --> 05:09.650]  OK, so I thought, well, you've seen a lot of you've seen a lot of stuff.
[05:09.790 --> 05:10.610]  So I thought, what is something?
[05:10.950 --> 05:14.130]  What's a movie that I like that maybe not a lot of people
[05:14.130 --> 05:15.290]  I know have seen?
[05:15.390 --> 05:18.610]  And I came up with a fish called Wanda, which I haven't seen.
[05:19.270 --> 05:20.150]  Haven't seen a good movie.
[05:20.610 --> 05:22.550]  Good sequel. Heavenly Creatures as well.
[05:22.990 --> 05:23.570]  Fierce Creatures.
[05:23.810 --> 05:25.050]  The Fierce Creatures, yeah.
[05:25.050 --> 05:30.290]  That got us into the conversation of the man, the legend, Kevin Kline.
[05:31.510 --> 05:33.650]  I saying like, I don't what was my point?
[05:33.730 --> 05:36.050]  I think it was like, I don't see him in anything anymore.
[05:36.490 --> 05:39.550]  Like, I don't feel like, yeah, I don't feel like I just see him in things.
[05:39.570 --> 05:40.590]  And I'm sure he's in a lot.
[05:41.070 --> 05:45.010]  Yeah, I feel like he he's known for just turning down so much stuff.
[05:45.370 --> 05:45.690]  Oh, really?
[05:45.850 --> 05:48.910]  But I think that I think I mean, the most recent stuff he's in is
[05:49.630 --> 05:51.910]  he's Mr. Fish Odor in Bob's Burgers.
[05:52.390 --> 05:53.990]  Yes. Which is current.
[05:54.650 --> 05:58.490]  But then I was telling Andrew about this weird piece of trivia that I once read,
[05:58.670 --> 06:02.430]  but that I actually misquoted, but, you know, it's along the same lines in that.
[06:02.570 --> 06:05.930]  OK, what I said to Andrew was that he is one of the few actors
[06:05.930 --> 06:09.770]  who has played two different roles in the same movie,
[06:10.390 --> 06:14.630]  where one at one point in the movie, one character has to impersonate the other.
[06:14.890 --> 06:16.370]  Did that connect with you, Geoff?
[06:16.410 --> 06:18.490]  Because I was very confused by this originally.
[06:18.910 --> 06:20.510]  I didn't understand the piece of trivia.
[06:20.510 --> 06:23.410]  He he's playing two different characters in a movie,
[06:23.650 --> 06:26.430]  and one of the characters has to impersonate the other character
[06:26.430 --> 06:27.370]  that he's impersonating.
[06:28.110 --> 06:32.270]  Yeah, and I was pulling from Wild Wild West where he plays,
[06:32.550 --> 06:34.730]  you know, the guy and then he also plays the president.
[06:34.990 --> 06:37.930]  And then at some point, his character impersonates the president.
[06:38.150 --> 06:42.150]  And then I was also thinking of Fierce Creatures, where he plays
[06:42.750 --> 06:47.610]  the Australian billionaire Rod McCain, and also he plays his son, Vince McCain.
[06:47.610 --> 06:51.610]  And at one point in the movie, he Vince McCain has to pretend to be Rod McCain.
[06:51.990 --> 06:54.010]  So I was like, how many times has this guy done this?
[06:54.270 --> 06:56.750]  But that wasn't even the interesting part of the trivia. That was wrong.
[06:57.350 --> 07:01.290]  He is one of the few actors who has played a character and the president
[07:02.530 --> 07:06.990]  where the other character impersonates the president in two different movies.
[07:07.450 --> 07:08.830]  So I was just thinking it was those two movies.
[07:08.850 --> 07:12.750]  But it was actually specifically the president, because in a movie called Dave.
[07:13.230 --> 07:14.130]  Yeah, he was in Dave.
[07:14.130 --> 07:17.670]  He also played himself and the president and then impersonated the president.
[07:17.930 --> 07:21.390]  So I was just like, how many times has this guy played two characters
[07:21.390 --> 07:22.990]  where one character impersonates the other?
[07:23.030 --> 07:25.390]  It's like a really specific thing. Who else has done that?
[07:25.810 --> 07:27.470]  It's a very special skill.
[07:27.810 --> 07:30.690]  It is. It is a weird thing to be known for.
[07:30.790 --> 07:33.130]  So I pondered for a little bit and I was thinking about it.
[07:33.150 --> 07:36.690]  And then I told Gavin, Peter Stormare did it in a movie called Splice.
[07:37.170 --> 07:37.950]  Played two characters.
[07:38.070 --> 07:40.930]  One of those characters pretended to be another character.
[07:41.470 --> 07:42.870]  Gavin was impressed by this
[07:42.870 --> 07:46.450]  because I don't think he had ever heard anyone reply with an actual answer to it.
[07:46.710 --> 07:49.410]  To which I then revealed that I made all of that up
[07:49.410 --> 07:53.330]  because Peter Stormare has a career that you can't really fully track.
[07:53.770 --> 07:55.910]  Splice is just a movie that I like.
[07:55.950 --> 07:57.150]  I didn't think Gavin would have seen.
[07:57.230 --> 07:58.310]  That was also kind of obscure.
[07:58.730 --> 08:00.510]  I just lied about it. I made up this fact.
[08:00.890 --> 08:03.970]  And I was living out because I was I was listening to him go on about this movie
[08:03.970 --> 08:05.870]  for a few minutes while we're playing Halo.
[08:06.030 --> 08:07.090]  And I was like, oh, interesting.
[08:07.170 --> 08:09.050]  You know, thinking like maybe I want to check that out.
[08:09.230 --> 08:12.110]  And then eventually it's just like, yeah, I was just lying.
[08:12.490 --> 08:13.370]  I just made it up.
[08:13.450 --> 08:16.910]  I couldn't think of I couldn't think of one.
[08:17.070 --> 08:18.890]  And it was a whole it was a whole issue.
[08:18.970 --> 08:22.250]  So then do we jump forward now to later?
[08:22.370 --> 08:23.830]  Completely different conversation.
[08:24.310 --> 08:25.610]  Probably over an hour later.
[08:25.770 --> 08:26.950]  An hour had passed.
[08:27.370 --> 08:32.270]  I was talking about how in last week's podcast, I flubbed my Chris
[08:32.270 --> 08:34.470]  where I said Chris Rock instead of Chris Tucker.
[08:34.850 --> 08:38.030]  And then we were talking and then you were talking to me about Chris Rock movies.
[08:38.310 --> 08:40.090]  I know I was talking to you about Jackie.
[08:40.090 --> 08:42.590]  We were ranking Jackie Chan's sidekicks.
[08:42.730 --> 08:43.550]  Well, that was the conversation.
[08:44.130 --> 08:47.370]  Yes. Who is like the greatest Jackie Chan sidekick of all time?
[08:47.410 --> 08:51.430]  I feel like Chris Tucker probably, but he's had some great sidekicks too.
[08:51.510 --> 08:52.710]  Then I then started talking.
[08:52.850 --> 08:56.650]  I started talking about a movie called Bad Company, which I was like, ah,
[08:56.650 --> 08:59.590]  that kind of feels like it should have been a Jackie Chan movie.
[08:59.710 --> 09:01.650]  So I don't know. Are you familiar with Bad Company, Geoff?
[09:01.810 --> 09:03.130]  I don't think so.
[09:03.230 --> 09:08.290]  It is an early 2000s Chris Rock action comedy with Chris Rock
[09:08.290 --> 09:12.890]  and Anthony Hopkins, where Chris Rock plays a secret agent
[09:12.890 --> 09:18.030]  who is deep undercover, dies, and then they recruit his twin brother
[09:18.590 --> 09:22.130]  who is completely unrelated, like doesn't he's kind of like a street
[09:22.130 --> 09:25.610]  hustler in my memory, could be wrong, but he's not like a trained agent
[09:25.610 --> 09:29.630]  to then take over the role of his brother who is undercover
[09:29.630 --> 09:31.410]  so they can continue their operation.
[09:31.590 --> 09:32.930]  I said all of this.
[09:33.050 --> 09:36.130]  It was telling me this and I was like, wait, so you're saying
[09:36.130 --> 09:41.130]  Chris Rock plays two characters and then one character impersonates the other.
[09:41.290 --> 09:46.050]  And I had accidentally given the answer to the piece of trivia.
[09:46.550 --> 09:49.190]  I had an answer. I just didn't know I had it.
[09:49.310 --> 09:50.750]  I knew it, but I didn't know I knew it.
[09:50.810 --> 09:52.710]  And that took us to the to the next stage of this.
[09:52.770 --> 09:54.510]  We thought that was pretty that was pretty funny.
[09:54.650 --> 09:55.850]  Accidental full circle.
[09:56.250 --> 09:59.990]  I look up the movie Bad Company on IMDb.
[10:00.570 --> 10:02.950]  Third billed actor, Peter Stormare.
[10:04.750 --> 10:09.750]  What are the freaking chances that he accidentally provides the answer to the question
[10:09.750 --> 10:14.230]  and in his answer is the same bullshit answer from before?
[10:14.610 --> 10:16.590]  It was just that we were just like, this is just too creepy.
[10:16.770 --> 10:17.990]  It's got it's got around.
[10:18.350 --> 10:20.850]  And with all the halo in between, it just felt mental.
[10:21.210 --> 10:25.210]  We just had to like come offline and be like, what the hell just happened?
[10:25.950 --> 10:26.850]  And that's that kind of thing.
[10:26.870 --> 10:29.450]  It happens way too many fucking times to be coincidence.
[10:29.570 --> 10:30.270]  That's really weird.
[10:30.570 --> 10:31.490]  It was weird.
[10:31.490 --> 10:35.330]  And it has been a problem where ever since I have lied about Peter Stormare,
[10:35.710 --> 10:37.310]  Peter Stormare is following me.
[10:37.610 --> 10:41.350]  Everything I want. Turns out he's in the tuxedo.
[10:41.690 --> 10:43.350]  That's the thing he's in. He's in that as well.
[10:43.530 --> 10:46.750]  I was playing Fast and Furious last night, the video game,
[10:46.810 --> 10:48.290]  the most recent video game that came out.
[10:48.590 --> 10:50.370]  Fucking Peter Stormare is the main villain.
[10:50.430 --> 10:51.210]  He's just in it.
[10:51.470 --> 10:53.550]  He's just showing up left and right in my life now.
[10:53.630 --> 10:58.510]  I can't avoid Peter Stormare since I made a random fake fact about it.
[10:59.030 --> 10:59.710]  He's following me.
[10:59.770 --> 11:00.410]  Hey, you know what?
[11:00.410 --> 11:01.530]  I have one.
[11:02.170 --> 11:03.270]  Oh, what's yours?
[11:04.150 --> 11:05.830]  OK, why did you say it like that?
[11:06.070 --> 11:06.510]  No, no.
[11:06.510 --> 11:07.010]  I'm excited.
[11:07.330 --> 11:08.710]  No, no, you're excited.
[11:08.850 --> 11:09.830]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:09.830 --> 11:12.710]  That was like, oh, that was like, oh, like, what's yours?
[11:12.810 --> 11:14.190]  Because I eventually came up with one.
[11:14.290 --> 11:15.250]  No, that was enthusiasm.
[11:15.330 --> 11:17.310]  Who went, oh, Gavin did.
[11:17.550 --> 11:19.210]  Andrew, you seemed very enthusiastic.
[11:19.510 --> 11:20.330]  OK, I'm sorry. I misunderstood.
[11:20.370 --> 11:22.550]  I thought you misunderstood. Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[11:22.910 --> 11:24.090]  Oh, go for it.
[11:24.170 --> 11:25.110]  And Gavin, it's just clear,
[11:25.770 --> 11:27.230]  I think I was just like,
[11:27.230 --> 11:30.790]  sorry, I opened my mouth and Gavin goes,
[11:31.850 --> 11:32.910]  they were unrelated.
[11:33.250 --> 11:33.710]  They were unrelated.
[11:34.010 --> 11:35.950]  It's like, you're like my first two wives, buddy.
[11:36.190 --> 11:37.550]  OK, here we go.
[11:38.690 --> 11:40.310]  In the movie Beer Fest,
[11:40.850 --> 11:44.870]  the guy that plays Landfill, he has, I believe he dies
[11:44.870 --> 11:47.730]  by drinking a vat of beer to save all their lives or something.
[11:47.890 --> 11:51.470]  And then so that guy, he's the Farva from Starship Troopers,
[11:51.530 --> 11:52.930]  or not sorry, from Super Troopers.
[11:54.150 --> 11:57.010]  Starship Troopers, Super Troopers would be a great mashup, by the way.
[11:57.010 --> 12:00.550]  I'd love to see it. Yeah, Starship, Super Troopers, whatever it is.
[12:00.870 --> 12:04.970]  Anyway, that guy, Landfill, he fucking dies, I think, by drinking
[12:04.970 --> 12:06.210]  like a vat of beer.
[12:06.470 --> 12:10.650]  And then his cousin shows up, Gil, who happens to look exactly like him
[12:10.650 --> 12:14.050]  for the funeral and then says, I'd like to join your group.
[12:14.210 --> 12:17.290]  And for the rest of the movie in his honor, will you just call me Landfill?
[12:17.430 --> 12:18.550]  And they're like, absolutely.
[12:18.930 --> 12:23.770]  So he he plays a character who dies, whose identical twin cousin shows up
[12:23.770 --> 12:24.650]  and plays him.
[12:25.410 --> 12:30.030]  Also, in Twin Peaks, I'm pretty sure Sheryl Lee
[12:30.750 --> 12:34.410]  plays herself a thirty five different fucking ways, including impersonating.
[12:34.650 --> 12:37.650]  Was that it was the cousin Maddie or something plays Laura Palmer at some point?
[12:37.910 --> 12:39.110]  Maddie Palmer. Yeah.
[12:39.150 --> 12:40.990]  So Sheryl Lee plays Laura Palmer.
[12:41.670 --> 12:45.430]  Then she plays Maddie Palmer, her cousin, who shows up,
[12:45.650 --> 12:49.690]  who then impersonates Laura Palmer to help try to solve the mystery
[12:49.690 --> 12:51.530]  of who killed Laura Palmer. So it's been done a lot.
[12:51.530 --> 12:53.870]  Yeah, I came up with parent trap as well.
[12:54.050 --> 12:57.350]  There's a lot of times it's been done, but I don't think anyone else
[12:57.350 --> 12:59.570]  has done it twice. And also the president.
[12:59.990 --> 13:03.570]  It's one of my favorite things now to just text Gavin random movies
[13:03.570 --> 13:07.910]  in which it occurs because he said it like, I don't think it has ever happened
[13:07.910 --> 13:09.550]  a single time outside of this.
[13:09.870 --> 13:12.390]  Like, never mind twice. It's never happened once.
[13:12.690 --> 13:14.350]  Ocean's Twelve was mine last night.
[13:14.890 --> 13:18.310]  Julia Roberts character in Ocean's Twelve, then also Julia Roberts,
[13:18.310 --> 13:19.650]  the celebrity exists.
[13:20.210 --> 13:24.090]  And part of the movie is Julia Roberts, the character impersonating
[13:24.090 --> 13:25.450]  Julia Roberts, the actor.
[13:25.570 --> 13:27.770]  It's another. How would that even work?
[13:27.790 --> 13:29.950]  Because surely her entire life, she must have thought, damn,
[13:29.970 --> 13:31.270]  I look like. Oh, my God, dude.
[13:31.630 --> 13:33.210]  I just watched a movie.
[13:33.890 --> 13:36.330]  I just watched a movie that is the whole fucking.
[13:36.550 --> 13:37.670]  This is the whole point of it.
[13:37.910 --> 13:40.870]  Have you guys seen The Princess Switch with Vanessa Hudgens on Netflix?
[13:41.310 --> 13:42.870]  I was watching Christmas movies.
[13:43.190 --> 13:45.690]  I watched the I was watching The Princess Switch.
[13:45.870 --> 13:47.430]  Not the best movie in the world,
[13:47.430 --> 13:50.550]  but the whole point of it is she's like a baker from Chicago
[13:50.550 --> 13:54.350]  who goes to this fake ass country to fill in a baking competition,
[13:54.790 --> 13:57.290]  meets a princess who nobody's ever seen.
[13:57.450 --> 13:59.150]  They look exactly alike each other.
[13:59.830 --> 14:02.990]  So they switch places so the princess can, for some reason,
[14:03.050 --> 14:04.170]  live in the normal world.
[14:04.270 --> 14:06.370]  But then they have to impersonate each other again.
[14:06.550 --> 14:09.370]  And then there's a sequel where they have to re-impersonate each other.
[14:09.470 --> 14:12.430]  And then another one where there's a fucking cousin that shows up
[14:12.430 --> 14:14.250]  and there's three of them that are all impersonating each other.
[14:14.830 --> 14:19.550]  This might be the most overused plot device in the history of plot devices.
[14:19.830 --> 14:20.750]  It sounds like it.
[14:20.890 --> 14:23.510]  I don't this doesn't seem like this is just a thing that occurs
[14:24.890 --> 14:27.130]  and not like an actual piece of trivia.
[14:27.830 --> 14:29.590]  It's like saying a play...
[14:32.270 --> 14:33.750]  It's like, here's a trivia fact.
[14:33.830 --> 14:34.610]  It rained here.
[14:34.710 --> 14:36.610]  Can you name another place in which it has rained?
[14:36.810 --> 14:38.230]  I don't know if you can come up with it.
[14:38.430 --> 14:39.950]  Like, it's just, it happens.
[14:39.950 --> 14:46.430]  Yeah, I will say, Geoff, if you're looking for another princess movie,
[14:46.570 --> 14:48.350]  Princess Protection Program, great movie.
[14:48.610 --> 14:49.450]  Great princess movie.
[14:49.770 --> 14:50.410]  What's that on?
[14:50.450 --> 14:52.030]  Great. It's Disney Plus.
[14:52.130 --> 14:53.350]  It's a Disney original channel.
[14:53.450 --> 14:54.530]  Cousin Greg is in it.
[14:54.590 --> 14:57.130]  A teenage cousin Greg from Succession.
[14:57.230 --> 14:57.650]  Very good.
[14:57.830 --> 15:01.890]  Oh, my God, dude, because cousin Greg has been phenomenal this season on Succession.
[15:02.310 --> 15:05.930]  By the way, speaking of movies, you know, I don't watch them, but I did recently.
[15:06.650 --> 15:09.770]  I fell off my don't watch movies horse and I watched one.
[15:09.770 --> 15:10.990]  And it was really fucking good.
[15:11.210 --> 15:12.070]  What did you say?
[15:12.590 --> 15:13.890]  I watched Home Sweet.
[15:14.090 --> 15:14.850]  See, there you go.
[15:16.050 --> 15:20.970]  I watched I watched Home Sweet Home Alone with Ellie Kemper and Rob Delaney.
[15:21.130 --> 15:22.090]  It was really fucking good.
[15:22.250 --> 15:26.490]  Yeah, the Home Alone sequel, interesting reboot, whatever you want to call it.
[15:26.490 --> 15:26.990]  It was great.
[15:27.410 --> 15:28.170]  It's a new Home Alone.
[15:28.430 --> 15:29.890]  You didn't know that there's a new Home Alone?
[15:30.370 --> 15:31.130]  No. Yeah, it's on.
[15:31.190 --> 15:32.110]  It's on Disney Plus.
[15:32.150 --> 15:34.010]  I was a little British kid, Gavin.
[15:34.250 --> 15:35.610]  Is Peter Stormare in it?
[15:36.950 --> 15:37.870]  No, he's not.
[15:37.870 --> 15:40.850]  It feels like if it came out in 2007, he would have been.
[15:41.170 --> 15:42.570]  Peter Stormare isn't in it.
[15:42.690 --> 15:47.190]  But Pete Holmes is, who is in every way a lesser version of that other man.
[15:47.790 --> 15:48.450]  Do you liked it?
[15:48.470 --> 15:51.770]  Because I feel like literally every other opinion I've heard about that movie is
[15:51.770 --> 15:53.370]  it's the worst film that's ever been made.
[15:53.950 --> 15:54.670]  That's ridiculous.
[15:55.090 --> 15:55.670]  It's not.
[15:55.810 --> 15:59.510]  I mean, you're never going to touch the first two, but it was good.
[15:59.690 --> 16:01.150]  It was heartfelt. It was funny.
[16:01.490 --> 16:03.790]  There was some legitimately funny stuff.
[16:04.010 --> 16:04.970]  Not as funny as the first.
[16:05.350 --> 16:06.530]  Kenan Thompson's OK in it.
[16:06.530 --> 16:08.750]  He plays like a real estate agent.
[16:09.130 --> 16:09.630]  Chris Parnell.
[16:09.750 --> 16:11.490]  I wish he was in it more.
[16:11.850 --> 16:13.090]  Chris Parnell, barely in it.
[16:13.230 --> 16:14.430]  Kenan Thompson's in it a little bit more.
[16:14.550 --> 16:16.810]  I wish to God, because Kenan's such a funny dude.
[16:16.870 --> 16:17.970]  I wish they would have used him more.
[16:18.310 --> 16:19.410]  But still, it's good, man.
[16:19.590 --> 16:21.390]  So is it in the same universes?
[16:22.430 --> 16:24.530]  Like, is it related to Kevin McAllister?
[16:25.070 --> 16:27.150]  Yes, it is in the Kevin McAllister universe.
[16:27.530 --> 16:27.610]  Really?
[16:27.610 --> 16:28.430]  I don't want to spoil.
[16:28.430 --> 16:30.370]  I don't want to spoil cameos and stuff.
[16:30.590 --> 16:34.490]  But there are there are definite overt cameos
[16:34.490 --> 16:37.090]  that make sense in the context of the film.
[16:37.270 --> 16:39.130]  And there are characters that appear.
[16:39.230 --> 16:40.430]  I'm going to watch this movie.
[16:40.490 --> 16:41.690]  I'm also going to watch this.
[16:41.750 --> 16:43.470]  Maybe next time you record, we'll have opinions.
[16:43.930 --> 16:45.230]  I'm only one in two. Great movies.
[16:45.550 --> 16:46.530]  Fantastic movies.
[16:46.910 --> 16:47.650]  Fantastic movies.
[16:47.810 --> 16:48.470]  Great movies.
[16:48.630 --> 16:51.450]  I'm I'm excited to hear that this is in the McAllister universe
[16:51.450 --> 16:53.310]  because in the trailer...
[16:53.310 --> 16:53.630]  The MCU?
[16:55.050 --> 16:56.670]  Yes, the MCU.
[17:02.950 --> 17:05.530]  It looked like they took a bunch of the gags
[17:05.530 --> 17:08.050]  from the first and like a few of the other movies
[17:08.050 --> 17:09.630]  and just put them all into one thing.
[17:09.710 --> 17:12.650]  So I'm happy that it's it's a continuation in some way.
[17:12.810 --> 17:15.450]  I think there's also another Home Alone coming out with Ryan Reynolds
[17:15.450 --> 17:16.710]  at some point.
[17:16.790 --> 17:17.170]  Oh, really?
[17:17.270 --> 17:17.810]  They announced that.
[17:17.970 --> 17:22.030]  But it's like an adult, like stuck at home and high, but dealing with robbers.
[17:22.050 --> 17:23.690]  But I could be misremembering that.
[17:24.090 --> 17:25.130]  That could have been a fever dream.
[17:25.590 --> 17:26.330]  I'll say this.
[17:26.330 --> 17:28.690]  They did something very smart in the movie,
[17:29.070 --> 17:30.950]  and I don't think it's spoiling too much.
[17:31.410 --> 17:36.590]  But the the the I don't think the kid like it's hard to find
[17:36.590 --> 17:37.790]  another Macaulay Culkin, right?
[17:37.810 --> 17:40.350]  Like he was a he was perfect for that role.
[17:40.650 --> 17:40.950]  Absolutely.
[17:41.310 --> 17:45.390]  And I really hard for anybody to live up to that role.
[17:45.610 --> 17:49.510]  And so they make it it's less focused on the kid and more a little bit
[17:49.510 --> 17:53.190]  more focused on the the people breaking in to the house.
[17:53.410 --> 17:55.470]  And I think that was a very smart choice.
[17:56.790 --> 17:57.590]  I like it.
[17:57.790 --> 17:58.630]  I will check that out.
[17:58.750 --> 18:00.370]  We're going to watch another movie as well.
[18:00.450 --> 18:01.910]  Your movie streak is far from done.
[18:03.030 --> 18:06.110]  I cannot wait for us to record our tuxedo watch,
[18:06.250 --> 18:09.490]  which at some point will happen, hopefully soon.
[18:09.490 --> 18:09.950]  Very excited.
[18:10.390 --> 18:11.410]  We're going to put it up, right?
[18:11.610 --> 18:12.390]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[18:12.610 --> 18:13.070]  Oh, I'm back.
[18:13.410 --> 18:14.490]  Gavin was gone. You were gone.
[18:14.730 --> 18:16.330]  I was, I think, freaked out for a second.
[18:16.790 --> 18:18.310]  Oh, that's we talking about tuxedo?
[18:18.890 --> 18:20.850]  Yes. I saying that we're going to do a thing for it.
[18:20.970 --> 18:21.850]  I'm excited for it.
[18:22.170 --> 18:23.390]  Adding to Geoff's movie list.
[18:24.650 --> 18:27.470]  Henry's Henry got a new football and he loves it.
[18:27.590 --> 18:32.310]  Speaking of stuff, we're going to do people loving the next time on F*** Face
[18:32.310 --> 18:34.090]  from minor league fan Geoff.
[18:34.150 --> 18:35.910]  Yeah. Oh, did a great job.
[18:36.170 --> 18:38.870]  I ran into him today at work, did, congratulated him.
[18:38.930 --> 18:39.730]  It did a really good job.
[18:40.090 --> 18:41.230]  I think we should do it every week.
[18:41.630 --> 18:43.410]  OK, sure. We can do it.
[18:43.710 --> 18:45.110]  We'll see how, let's see how long that lasts.
[18:46.790 --> 18:48.550]  It'll be until we stop being one ahead.
[18:49.850 --> 18:51.990]  Yeah, it'll go on the pile of forgotten comedy
[18:51.990 --> 18:56.470]  like The Smashing Sportsman and Ping Pong Balls and who knows whatever.
[18:56.670 --> 18:57.470]  And F***ing Baskets.
[18:57.950 --> 18:59.850]  No, I did The Baskets as part of the redemption.
[18:59.850 --> 19:05.290]  How dare you throw that in as an unsolved or an unresolved issue of our podcast.
[19:05.290 --> 19:08.470]  What is your potential redemption-y redo, Andrew, that you mentioned?
[19:08.550 --> 19:10.690]  I heard, I heard about the Jacks.
[19:10.710 --> 19:13.270]  So I was aware that the Jack thing had happened.
[19:13.690 --> 19:16.710]  I'd seen some comments about it, or at least I thought I did.
[19:16.930 --> 19:19.050]  And so I was like, oh, I'll listen to it.
[19:19.130 --> 19:20.310]  So I assumed it would be.
[19:20.310 --> 19:21.950]  And we've had several talks about this.
[19:22.010 --> 19:24.050]  There's no excuse to this, but I didn't know where it was.
[19:24.250 --> 19:26.910]  I assumed it would be at the start of the episode.
[19:27.130 --> 19:28.950]  So I listened to the beginning of the episode.
[19:29.070 --> 19:31.750]  And as it is known, I don't listen to our show
[19:31.750 --> 19:33.850]  because I hate myself too much to do so.
[19:33.910 --> 19:36.290]  You don't listen to our show while we're making it.
[19:36.470 --> 19:38.750]  No, yeah, that's true.
[19:38.950 --> 19:39.490]  That's true.
[19:40.390 --> 19:44.830]  I so I watched the beginning of it or listened to it, and it's not there.
[19:44.870 --> 19:47.410]  So I'm like, OK, I'll come to the end, go to the end of it.
[19:47.750 --> 19:48.770]  It's not there as well.
[19:49.030 --> 19:50.070]  I don't know where it is.
[19:50.070 --> 19:51.690]  It's definitely in there somewhere.
[19:51.970 --> 19:54.950]  But on top of that, I didn't know we had outro music.
[19:55.150 --> 19:56.370]  That blew my mind.
[19:56.650 --> 19:59.710]  That was genuinely shocking last night to hear outro music come in.
[19:59.830 --> 20:00.490]  I was surprised.
[20:00.730 --> 20:02.810]  I learned last night that this show has outro music.
[20:03.090 --> 20:04.370]  Same as the intro music.
[20:04.750 --> 20:05.350]  But it's there.
[20:05.670 --> 20:06.790]  Didn't know it was there.
[20:08.030 --> 20:09.570]  We've done this 81 times.
[20:09.570 --> 20:11.950]  Yeah, I was trying to figure out what episode it was.
[20:12.170 --> 20:13.530]  This is 81. We're recording 81.
[20:13.670 --> 20:16.250]  Yeah, it took 81 times for me to realize that there's an outro.
[20:16.470 --> 20:18.110]  We do an outro song and we fade out.
[20:18.650 --> 20:20.690]  And then I guess it's a gag sometimes.
[20:20.810 --> 20:21.210]  It's great.
[20:21.470 --> 20:23.010]  This is a good job on the edit.
[20:23.250 --> 20:23.970]  Nick's a great editor.
[20:24.610 --> 20:25.130]  He's great.
[20:25.450 --> 20:28.210]  And sometimes like the outro music will stop in the middle.
[20:28.710 --> 20:31.230]  If for some reason don't end it or just continue.
[20:31.730 --> 20:35.650]  I think that's maybe what happened in that episode, which is why I missed the jack thing.
[20:35.830 --> 20:36.470]  Is that correct?
[20:36.550 --> 20:38.750]  That like it looked like we're going to end and it goes to the jack
[20:38.750 --> 20:40.630]  and then we continue beyond the jack?
[20:41.150 --> 20:44.930]  Nick wanted to put the jack thing at the moment where we discussed it this time.
[20:45.150 --> 20:45.490]  OK.
[20:45.770 --> 20:47.930]  And then going forward, it'll be at the end.
[20:47.930 --> 20:50.750]  OK, well, I'll find the jack at some point.
[20:51.230 --> 20:51.610]  I'm excited.
[20:51.910 --> 20:52.410]  A few minutes from now.
[20:52.510 --> 20:53.090]  It's an hour.
[20:53.190 --> 20:54.990]  It's an hour and seven minutes in, I think.
[20:55.290 --> 20:56.150]  OK, well, there we go.
[20:56.190 --> 20:56.510]  Thank you.
[20:56.830 --> 20:57.410]  That that result.
[20:57.990 --> 20:58.390]  Awesome.
[20:59.150 --> 21:01.930]  Have we explained what we're talking about at any point during this conversation?
[21:02.370 --> 21:04.250]  Well, we're just assuming that.
[21:04.530 --> 21:07.830]  Yeah, we're assuming that everyone who's listened to this has listened to that one
[21:07.830 --> 21:08.150]  as well.
[21:08.590 --> 21:10.190]  We should recap it for us every week.
[21:10.230 --> 21:12.470]  We're going to try and get Jack to read the discord chat
[21:12.470 --> 21:14.650]  that we that happens while we record.
[21:14.830 --> 21:17.490]  And then we put that we have Jack.
[21:17.930 --> 21:20.970]  Figure out what we talked about and then put that recording of Jack
[21:20.970 --> 21:25.310]  explaining it on the previous episode at the end as a little teaser.
[21:25.450 --> 21:28.130]  Can I do some more more cleanup work right here?
[21:28.230 --> 21:31.050]  Like, just call something out because I don't feel like I feel like we miss
[21:31.050 --> 21:32.630]  doing this last time.
[21:32.810 --> 21:34.630]  And I don't know if this will be.
[21:34.850 --> 21:38.390]  Geoff, are you going to post your your Apple Apple van video?
[21:38.570 --> 21:39.530]  Is that going to go up anywhere?
[21:40.070 --> 21:41.450]  Oh, did we not post that?
[21:41.850 --> 21:42.250]  I don't know.
[21:42.290 --> 21:43.470]  I don't think that episode's out yet.
[21:43.550 --> 21:45.390]  That episode hasn't come out yet.
[21:45.470 --> 21:46.090]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:46.110 --> 21:46.730]  No, for sure.
[21:46.730 --> 21:48.710]  Yeah, it'll be it'll be on.
[21:49.210 --> 21:51.490]  I'll I'll I'll have it put up on the Instagram.
[21:51.970 --> 21:53.830]  OK, is that by Apple video?
[21:53.950 --> 21:55.350]  You mean me?
[21:56.390 --> 21:59.150]  You excitedly taking a photo of an Apple van.
[21:59.230 --> 22:00.250]  I've been here ever since.
[22:00.550 --> 22:01.330]  Yeah, yeah.
[22:01.630 --> 22:06.030]  After the last like five days, I've been walking around my place just going apples.
[22:06.730 --> 22:07.870]  I'm going to text my friend.
[22:08.110 --> 22:09.810]  It just makes me laugh. It's a great.
[22:09.950 --> 22:11.670]  It's one of the funniest videos I've seen in a long time.
[22:11.990 --> 22:14.590]  I meant to bring it up at the time where people could see it.
[22:14.870 --> 22:15.710]  We didn't do that.
[22:15.710 --> 22:16.770]  We just brushed past it.
[22:16.810 --> 22:19.510]  So if we're calling things out from the past, explaining things,
[22:20.070 --> 22:21.770]  go to the Instagram to see that great video.
[22:22.150 --> 22:23.690]  Yeah, see the me.
[22:23.810 --> 22:24.950]  It was right after my colonoscopy.
[22:25.490 --> 22:27.010]  I have zero memory of this.
[22:27.770 --> 22:29.370]  It's a pretty short video, about a minute long.
[22:30.490 --> 22:32.830]  So while we're cleaning stuff up, I have a couple of things
[22:32.830 --> 22:35.410]  I wanted to go over the real brief, but while we're cleaning stuff up
[22:35.410 --> 22:38.270]  and because it's probably still December at this point,
[22:38.270 --> 22:42.790]  I feel like we need to mention there is a plethora of face related merchandise
[22:42.790 --> 22:47.730]  that you can buy that is the perfect stocking stuffer or a gag gift
[22:47.730 --> 22:50.550]  or sincere gift or fuck you gift.
[22:50.650 --> 22:53.530]  I don't really care what you do with it, but just get it.
[22:53.550 --> 22:55.470]  Oh, get it just in time for January, as Eric says.
[22:55.830 --> 23:00.630]  Yeah, B11, you do this every year.
[23:01.250 --> 23:03.450]  I'm talking to you, regular regulation listener.
[23:03.570 --> 23:04.730]  I'm talking to you, comment leaver.
[23:04.850 --> 23:05.690]  You do this every year.
[23:05.750 --> 23:08.110]  You wait till the last second and then you try to buy a gift
[23:08.110 --> 23:10.790]  and you buy it today on a website and then they tell you
[23:10.790 --> 23:12.070]  that it doesn't ship till fucking March.
[23:12.070 --> 23:14.530]  So now you're like, I guess I'm sending, I guess I'm getting my girlfriend
[23:14.530 --> 23:17.450]  a picture of this thing for Christmas because I'm not going to have it till March.
[23:17.530 --> 23:20.410]  Oh, also, I can't fucking cancel the order for some reason
[23:20.410 --> 23:22.230]  because they're like, fuck you, buddy.
[23:22.650 --> 23:26.310]  The option to do that's the cancel button stuck on a fucking boat from China
[23:26.310 --> 23:28.730]  to suck my dick so I can't fucking cancel it.
[23:28.830 --> 23:30.630]  So I guess in March, my girlfriend's going to get her Christmas gift.
[23:30.830 --> 23:33.850]  Anyway, don't be like me or be like you.
[23:34.210 --> 23:36.670]  Buy it now. Eleven and a half months early.
[23:36.930 --> 23:38.270]  You'll be ready for next year.
[23:38.410 --> 23:39.650]  Sounds like thank me later.
[23:40.110 --> 23:41.230]  It does. Thank me later.
[23:41.230 --> 23:43.550]  Yeah, it's sort of the opposite of it, right?
[23:43.710 --> 23:48.150]  Because I would you buy the Christmas gift now and I'd send it to you in August.
[23:48.450 --> 23:50.110]  I think it's how thank me later would work.
[23:50.750 --> 23:52.030]  You can't schedule in advance.
[23:52.750 --> 23:54.330]  How's that different to getting it in March?
[23:54.810 --> 23:55.870]  What do you what are you saying?
[23:56.010 --> 23:57.230]  Oh, well, I think thank me later.
[23:57.290 --> 23:58.430]  You don't know when you're getting it, right?
[23:58.490 --> 23:59.450]  Yeah, that's exactly.
[23:59.630 --> 24:01.150]  There's no there's no control to it.
[24:01.430 --> 24:02.030]  It's a surprise.
[24:02.430 --> 24:03.470]  Sorry, I was not listening.
[24:03.590 --> 24:04.350]  I was doing my role.
[24:04.430 --> 24:06.790]  I was thinking about Jack in the podcast.
[24:09.050 --> 24:12.650]  You must be your ears are shut for like 50% of every podcast.
[24:12.690 --> 24:14.890]  No, this is honestly what happened.
[24:14.970 --> 24:15.530]  That's not true.
[24:15.650 --> 24:16.950]  I listen to way more.
[24:17.150 --> 24:18.670]  Also, I'd say it's only 90%.
[24:18.670 --> 24:24.130]  You're going to fucking talk about not listening and interrupt me in the middle of me talking.
[24:24.330 --> 24:30.630]  You're going to be like, you don't listen 90% of the time and just start talking over me in the middle of me talking.
[24:31.070 --> 24:32.070]  That's what you're going to do.
[24:32.190 --> 24:33.530]  You're going to hold this position.
[24:34.030 --> 24:36.650]  I was explaining why I wasn't listening.
[24:36.650 --> 24:40.970]  Well, you just decided that it wasn't worth listening to and started talking over me.
[24:41.270 --> 24:42.770]  I was trying to sneak in.
[24:43.170 --> 24:44.590]  There's no sneaking it in.
[24:44.670 --> 24:46.070]  I'm talking loudly.
[24:46.290 --> 24:47.310]  There's no sneaking.
[24:47.790 --> 24:48.450]  All right, go ahead.
[24:48.710 --> 24:49.590]  No, you go ahead.
[24:49.770 --> 24:50.510]  You have the floor.
[24:50.550 --> 24:51.270]  It's very important.
[24:51.390 --> 24:52.010]  What you need to say.
[24:52.070 --> 24:52.470]  Go ahead.
[24:53.290 --> 24:53.670]  Well, I was.
[24:53.790 --> 24:54.850]  No, you do it.
[24:54.950 --> 24:55.690]  No, you go.
[24:55.890 --> 24:56.470]  You go, Gavin.
[24:56.590 --> 24:57.370]  The floor is yours.
[24:57.470 --> 24:58.430]  I've stepped out of the way.
[24:58.750 --> 24:59.030]  Continue.
[25:01.750 --> 25:03.350]  I'll just be silent the whole show.
[25:04.150 --> 25:05.850]  No, no, I wouldn't do that
[25:05.850 --> 25:07.470]  because I need to talk about a thing.
[25:07.710 --> 25:08.010]  I'll get it.
[25:08.090 --> 25:08.410]  You know what?
[25:08.490 --> 25:09.690]  I am going to take the floor, Gavin.
[25:10.070 --> 25:14.550]  The reason why I wasn't listening is because we just talked about the apple van.
[25:14.830 --> 25:16.690]  I have a cosmic crisp on my desk.
[25:16.810 --> 25:17.610]  I haven't eaten it yet.
[25:17.610 --> 25:18.770]  Haven't tried it yet.
[25:18.870 --> 25:21.510]  I have had it for like five days.
[25:21.690 --> 25:25.070]  It has been so hard not to eat any of these delicious apples.
[25:25.330 --> 25:26.770]  It's been in my mind constantly.
[25:26.770 --> 25:28.110]  I'm just staring at it.
[25:28.550 --> 25:29.910]  I'm excited to try this.
[25:30.210 --> 25:33.270]  Are you going to have it today or are you going to wait 361 more days?
[25:33.450 --> 25:34.790]  No, I'm going to have it.
[25:34.790 --> 25:38.030]  Well, I have a whole bag of them, Gavin, so I'm going to save one in the fridge
[25:38.030 --> 25:39.150]  because we're going to do the year thing.
[25:39.690 --> 25:40.350]  Yeah, do we?
[25:40.710 --> 25:42.250]  Gav, do you have any cosmic crisps right now?
[25:42.650 --> 25:42.930]  No.
[25:43.490 --> 25:44.410]  I don't either. I need to get one.
[25:44.510 --> 25:44.910]  We'll put them in.
[25:44.950 --> 25:46.090]  I've got one on my desk at work.
[25:46.210 --> 25:48.390]  If you didn't glue it to something or...
[25:48.390 --> 25:51.890]  Well, are we recording next week like normal?
[25:52.270 --> 25:53.630]  Is everybody in town and recording like normal?
[25:53.970 --> 25:54.530]  I will be right.
[25:54.750 --> 25:55.390]  I'll be back.
[25:55.510 --> 25:59.090]  Let's let's let's put our apples in next next in the fridge next week.
[25:59.170 --> 25:59.390]  We will.
[25:59.930 --> 26:01.010]  But Andrew, I want you.
[26:01.050 --> 26:02.750]  But we'll put our apples in like the fridge here.
[26:02.770 --> 26:03.530]  We'll begin next week.
[26:04.050 --> 26:06.790]  Andrew, I want to hear you eat this thing and I want to hear it.
[26:06.990 --> 26:11.290]  I was reading some comments today from from not regulation listeners,
[26:11.390 --> 26:14.370]  obviously, comment leavers who were mentioning how much they love it
[26:14.370 --> 26:15.310]  when we eat on camera.
[26:15.570 --> 26:18.710]  So, however, I think we should end on it like a big thing.
[26:19.370 --> 26:19.770]  What?
[26:20.130 --> 26:20.530]  So...
[26:20.530 --> 26:20.910]  What?
[26:21.590 --> 26:22.170]  Never mind.
[26:22.290 --> 26:23.570]  He's done it again, hasn't he?
[26:24.670 --> 26:27.770]  It was in his gullet while you were explaining it.
[26:28.170 --> 26:30.550]  I'm talking about salad cream, the fucking apple.
[26:30.570 --> 26:30.970]  No.
[26:30.970 --> 26:33.910]  He's mouth open, ears closed at all times.
[26:35.010 --> 26:36.010]  That was no.
[26:36.350 --> 26:37.390]  That was your fault.
[26:37.930 --> 26:38.470]  You said.
[26:39.750 --> 26:42.970]  You said you want me to do it and you want it to be allowed.
[26:43.390 --> 26:46.210]  So I took a big bite into the microphone.
[26:48.390 --> 26:50.050]  This is a delicious apple.
[26:51.250 --> 26:53.110]  Eric has a problem with what just happened, Eric.
[26:53.250 --> 26:54.130]  This is a great apple.
[26:54.210 --> 26:55.110]  I don't understand.
[26:55.350 --> 26:58.310]  I want you to be able to review the apple and everything.
[26:58.510 --> 26:59.090]  I don't understand.
[26:59.210 --> 27:00.430]  Whose fault is this?
[27:00.430 --> 27:02.970]  Oh, it's Geoff's fault because he said, I want you to...
[27:02.970 --> 27:06.690]  His exact words were, I want you to eat the apple and I want it to be loud.
[27:06.790 --> 27:08.910]  So I immediately accommodated his request.
[27:09.070 --> 27:11.470]  Hey, did you guys hear that at all when he took a bite?
[27:13.090 --> 27:14.250]  Did you guys hear a bite?
[27:14.410 --> 27:17.310]  Did you guys hear a bite at all or were you just surprised when he was chewing?
[27:17.410 --> 27:18.910]  No, it's just in his mouth already.
[27:18.930 --> 27:20.230]  OK, cool. Just make it sure. Thank you.
[27:23.370 --> 27:25.330]  What people said about us eating on mic?
[27:25.790 --> 27:27.610]  They love it. More, more, please.
[27:30.430 --> 27:34.810]  Somebody was like, I swear to God, every time I tune into an RT podcast,
[27:34.850 --> 27:38.330]  no matter what it is, somebody's eating and it's driving and they hated it.
[27:38.370 --> 27:39.170]  And I thought that was funny.
[27:39.390 --> 27:40.430]  Talking about food a lot.
[27:40.810 --> 27:41.490]  This is a tart.
[27:41.670 --> 27:42.830]  Wait, well, listen, we're talking.
[27:42.970 --> 27:45.330]  One of the things I wanted to do was talk about a little bit more food.
[27:45.410 --> 27:48.850]  But right now, I really think Andrew should just go.
[27:49.310 --> 27:50.290]  This is a tart apple.
[27:50.810 --> 27:51.750]  This is a tart apple.
[27:51.830 --> 27:52.550]  This is a pretty apple.
[27:52.590 --> 27:53.490]  This is a big apple.
[27:54.390 --> 27:56.250]  Very crisp, not chewy.
[27:57.870 --> 27:58.270]  Sweet.
[27:59.010 --> 28:00.230]  This is a very good apple.
[28:00.550 --> 28:01.570]  How juicy is it?
[28:01.970 --> 28:04.150]  I wouldn't I wouldn't say it's too juicy.
[28:04.650 --> 28:07.350]  It's like I'd say it's pretty average on the juice scale.
[28:07.490 --> 28:09.410]  Was it was your guys's apple juicy?
[28:09.750 --> 28:11.150]  Yeah, I choose to live in my shorts.
[28:11.850 --> 28:14.050]  Yeah, I was surprised at how juicy it was.
[28:14.130 --> 28:17.090]  I thought that was one of the defining characteristics of it was was the juice.
[28:18.010 --> 28:19.970]  Mine wasn't. Mine's not very juicy.
[28:20.070 --> 28:21.510]  It was very crisp.
[28:21.790 --> 28:23.430]  There is a crispness to it.
[28:23.450 --> 28:24.870]  It bit really well.
[28:25.350 --> 28:27.230]  It wasn't chewy. I hate a chewy apple.
[28:27.750 --> 28:28.710]  I hate when it's well.
[28:29.150 --> 28:29.630]  It bit well.
[28:29.750 --> 28:32.590]  There's a bite test to there's a bite feel to apples, Gavin.
[28:32.690 --> 28:33.170]  It bit well.
[28:33.230 --> 28:37.910]  It broke away from the core in a way that was satisfying and not mushy.
[28:38.030 --> 28:39.010]  You hate a mushy app.
[28:39.090 --> 28:41.390]  I personally, I fucking can't stand a mushy app.
[28:41.950 --> 28:43.070]  What's your sticker look like?
[28:43.110 --> 28:43.690]  What's your code?
[28:44.230 --> 28:45.590]  Um, my.
[28:50.320 --> 28:51.720]  You didn't eat the sticker, did you?
[28:52.060 --> 28:52.460]  No.
[28:52.860 --> 28:57.920]  Oh, um, OK, well, we can review the apple at the end of the show.
[28:58.860 --> 28:59.700]  You in the wrong?
[28:59.820 --> 29:00.300]  What are you doing?
[29:00.740 --> 29:01.200]  What's happened?
[29:02.480 --> 29:04.160]  I think you ate the wrong apple.
[29:05.080 --> 29:07.880]  It's I'm eating a pink lady, apparently.
[29:08.200 --> 29:09.500]  What the fuck?
[29:09.980 --> 29:11.480]  What is this show?
[29:11.880 --> 29:12.900]  Is this for real?
[29:12.940 --> 29:13.620]  No, no, no, no.
[29:13.700 --> 29:14.540]  Are you serious?
[29:15.140 --> 29:16.960]  Is this for real?
[29:17.120 --> 29:17.960]  What the hell?
[29:18.560 --> 29:19.000]  Wait.
[29:19.100 --> 29:20.460]  No, I have a crust of crisps.
[29:20.920 --> 29:25.560]  I must. I put there must have been a pink lady amongst the pile of the crisps.
[29:25.660 --> 29:27.160]  And it was in the bag.
[29:27.160 --> 29:33.880]  I do have a Cosmic Crisp, though, that I haven't been into. We can make that be the finale, like you said, Geoff.
[29:34.260 --> 29:36.560]  There was an apple switcheroo!
[29:36.920 --> 29:41.240]  It was. I'll take a photo of my apple.
[29:42.240 --> 29:46.260]  Hey, now we know a couple of things, right?
[29:46.600 --> 29:49.020]  We got the Pink Lady review.
[29:49.680 --> 29:53.280]  We know Pink Lady is among Andrew's favorite apples because it was even in the house.
[29:53.940 --> 29:55.220]  He's revealed two of his favorites.
[29:56.340 --> 30:01.340]  And we can have it as a baseline to compare his reaction to the Cosmic Crisp.
[30:01.700 --> 30:06.140]  And by the way, I'm glad it wasn't a Cosmic Crisp because I was fucking confused when you said it wasn't juicy.
[30:06.520 --> 30:09.480]  Because that felt like a very different apple than what we had.
[30:09.600 --> 30:11.080]  I am stunned right now.
[30:11.380 --> 30:14.300]  How did you do- you saw what the Cosmic Crisp looked like.
[30:14.620 --> 30:20.480]  They look similar- I just- I went in, I grabbed a bag of apples from my fridge, and there's a Pink Lady.
[30:20.640 --> 30:25.080]  I don't know how many- I need to check if that's the only-
[30:25.080 --> 30:29.320]  All of your apples are mixed together, or did you accidentally buy a Pink Lady amongst the Cosmic?
[30:29.320 --> 30:34.360]  No! No, no, no, no, no, no. I think I accidentally bought a Pink Lady amongst the Cosmic Crisps.
[30:34.920 --> 30:37.800]  I think there must have been a Pink- I somehow grabbed the Pink Lady.
[30:38.100 --> 30:39.900]  It sounds like you stole a Pink Lady.
[30:40.820 --> 30:42.100]  Or I paid-
[30:42.100 --> 30:43.680]  Or you paid Cosmic Crisp pricing.
[30:44.160 --> 30:46.920]  I think I paid Cosmic Crisp pricing for a Pink Lady.
[30:47.460 --> 30:48.400]  Gonna mess up their stock.
[30:48.920 --> 30:50.260]  How do I take a photo that-
[30:50.260 --> 30:52.120]  Now their apple stock's off by one.
[30:52.300 --> 30:52.560]  Yeah.
[30:53.240 --> 30:59.040]  You're- How did that happen? I'm still blown away that you were eating a different-
[30:59.040 --> 31:06.200]  Also, thank God we asked about the sticker. Otherwise, we'd never know. You'd be living a lie for the rest of your life.
[31:06.320 --> 31:10.640]  Imagine if he was eating the 100% cocoa, and he's like, oh, sorry, I was eating ice cream.
[31:11.040 --> 31:18.220]  I didn't- We would've eventually learned when I flipped the apple, I just bit into the apple on the opposite of the sticker side.
[31:18.220 --> 31:23.840]  You just are so keen to start eating before we're ready that you didn't even look at the apple.
[31:24.380 --> 31:30.020]  So, see, that's- I ate that half of the apple, and I flipped it over, and it's just Pink Lady.
[31:30.340 --> 31:32.100]  Oh, yeah, 41.30? What the fuck?
[31:33.080 --> 31:38.400]  Gavin, it would be like if we found out all these years that he's hated bananas, he was eating lemons.
[31:38.720 --> 31:40.020]  And he's like, what? They're both yellow.
[31:41.180 --> 31:42.600]  They're essentially the same thing.
[31:43.220 --> 31:46.920]  If we didn't make the joke about which, like, batch number he had...
[31:46.920 --> 31:49.900]  He would never have known! He would've just had a Pink Lady.
[31:50.740 --> 31:54.920]  I eventually- When I flipped the apple, I think I would've noticed, but it's just when would I have flipped the apple?
[31:56.340 --> 32:01.360]  Eric's commenting about my large bites. I was trying to make noise. I wanted noise for the- Geoff wanted it loud.
[32:01.480 --> 32:03.700]  I was trying to make the loudest crunch I could make.
[32:05.120 --> 32:08.980]  Well, you- You made something, alright. Jesus Christ.
[32:09.440 --> 32:14.680]  Okay, so, well, we got the- I will have the Cosmic Crisp later, I guess. It's the finale, like Geoff wants. We'll just do what Geoff wants.
[32:14.680 --> 32:17.880]  Fuck it. We'll eat the other one later. It's fine.
[32:19.620 --> 32:22.880]  Oh, Christ. Oh, my God.
[32:23.480 --> 32:24.320]  Oh, God.
[32:29.130 --> 32:32.170]  Hey, thank you so much for listening to the show.
[32:32.370 --> 32:33.850]  I hope you're enjoying this episode.
[32:34.190 --> 32:40.470]  I do have to take a moment, though, to talk about one of our great sponsors, HelloFresh, America's number one meal kit.
[32:40.470 --> 32:51.170]  The holidays can be hectic, but HelloFresh helps keep things simple with recipes that cut back on meal prep and cleanup so you can spend less time in the kitchen and more quality time with friends and family.
[32:51.550 --> 33:00.950]  HelloFresh offers 50 menu and market items to choose from every week, including vegetarian, calorie smart, and gourmet options, providing plenty of variety.
[33:01.470 --> 33:07.190]  Save on average over $65 per month when you order HelloFresh instead of grocery shopping.
[33:07.190 --> 33:11.550]  That's more money to spend on presents and activities, which is wonderful.
[33:11.970 --> 33:12.750]  That's a great thing.
[33:12.870 --> 33:17.370]  Another thing it saves you on that I think is so valuable, especially this time of year, is time.
[33:17.650 --> 33:20.650]  Just the convenience of knowing I already have my meals picked up.
[33:20.730 --> 33:22.430]  They're going to show up in this awesome box.
[33:22.490 --> 33:27.330]  I'm going to get to make some food that is both delicious and incredibly easy to put together.
[33:27.650 --> 33:32.510]  It's so exciting, especially this time of year where it's just tough to find that time.
[33:32.930 --> 33:34.890]  And there's just so many great recipes to pick from.
[33:34.890 --> 33:37.450]  I personally really enjoy the chicken parm salad.
[33:37.950 --> 33:39.990]  The peppercorn steak is another favorite of mine.
[33:40.090 --> 33:43.830]  But it's really hard to go wrong with any of the choices you could possibly make.
[33:44.190 --> 33:45.730]  It's so quick and easy.
[33:46.190 --> 33:54.970]  Go to hellofresh.com slash face14 and use code face14 for up to 14 free meals and 3 free gifts.
[33:54.970 --> 34:04.970]  Once again, if you would like 14 free meals plus 3 free gifts, use code face14 at hellofresh.com slash face14.
[34:06.970 --> 34:13.530]  Can I tell you guys a short story that wasn't allowed to be funny until now and now I'm allowed to laugh at it?
[34:13.670 --> 34:14.410]  Okay, of course.
[34:15.090 --> 34:26.050]  Wednesday night, last week, right before Thanksgiving, the girlfriend and I go to the storage facility to get Christmas decorations and stuff.
[34:26.870 --> 34:30.210]  Of which there's an entire storage facility full of.
[34:30.630 --> 34:32.450]  My girlfriend is very fucking festive.
[34:33.030 --> 34:34.030]  And I mean that in a good way.
[34:34.230 --> 34:36.310]  I realize that sounded biting, but that's not how I mean it.
[34:36.950 --> 34:39.830]  And she also listens and I love it.
[34:39.970 --> 34:43.370]  I'm eating my burnt Pop-Tart off of a Christmas plate right now.
[34:43.370 --> 34:45.570]  And I'm joyous to be doing so.
[34:46.110 --> 34:46.330]  I love it.
[34:46.330 --> 34:51.370]  Anyway, so we go and we load up the two carts full of Tupperwares.
[34:52.210 --> 34:55.170]  Full of fucking, you know, like Rubbermaid bins full of ornaments and shit.
[34:55.450 --> 35:00.490]  And I push out the elevator, go out the sliding, you know, double open doors.
[35:01.050 --> 35:03.190]  And I'm putting stuff in the car.
[35:04.030 --> 35:08.290]  And I realize she's not behind me and I turn around and she's still not behind me.
[35:08.290 --> 35:09.750]  And I think, that's weird, we were in the elevator together.
[35:09.750 --> 35:15.250]  So I run back inside and she's just like standing in the middle of the elevator.
[35:15.250 --> 35:17.510]  Half out with like the cart, half in and half out.
[35:17.610 --> 35:22.270]  Bent over and the doors just keep like hitting the fucking cart and her a little bit.
[35:22.550 --> 35:28.010]  And she's just like, I thought she was confused or nauseous or like maybe she'd thrown up.
[35:28.110 --> 35:30.130]  Or like, I don't know what was going on.
[35:30.610 --> 35:32.650]  And, but her body language is not good.
[35:33.230 --> 35:36.770]  So I run over there and I'm like, dude, what's up? What's going on? What's wrong?
[35:37.290 --> 35:40.430]  And she goes, uh, uh, I don't know what to do.
[35:40.550 --> 35:44.030]  And I'm like, oh fuck, did her eyeball pop out or like, Jesus, this sounds bad.
[35:44.130 --> 35:45.470]  Like, is she having palpitations?
[35:45.690 --> 35:49.130]  And she's like, I don't know, I don't know how it happened. I don't know what to do.
[35:50.350 --> 35:52.790]  And she's like panicking and I'm like, well, what happened?
[35:52.910 --> 35:55.530]  And she goes, my keys were on the Rubbermaid.
[35:56.690 --> 36:01.070]  And when I was pushing out, the door clipped it and they fell.
[36:01.190 --> 36:02.850]  And I think they fell down the elevator shaft.
[36:03.250 --> 36:04.510]  And I'm like, that's impossible.
[36:04.510 --> 36:06.770]  And so we move out and we look.
[36:07.010 --> 36:14.710]  And sure enough, she dropped her car and house and everything keys off that Rubbermaid.
[36:14.910 --> 36:22.790]  They went straight down the elevator into the abyss at 1030 at night, the night before Thanksgiving.
[36:23.190 --> 36:26.370]  And is this one of those storage facilities where there's no staff?
[36:27.070 --> 36:29.990]  Well, there's certainly no staff there at 10 o'clock at night.
[36:29.990 --> 36:32.910]  And there's certainly not going to be a staff there during the holidays.
[36:34.050 --> 36:35.470]  Yeah, it was dead ass empty.
[36:35.790 --> 36:40.450]  So, uh, we were able to get in her car with the I hadn't opened the back door yet.
[36:40.510 --> 36:41.910]  We were able to get in her car with her phone.
[36:42.110 --> 36:43.730]  You know, she could like unlock the car with her phone.
[36:43.850 --> 36:49.070]  And then she had to like Uber home, get my car, come back and finish or get extra keys.
[36:49.170 --> 36:49.470]  Come back.
[36:51.290 --> 36:54.870]  She didn't get her fucking car keys back until like Sunday.
[36:54.870 --> 37:00.730]  They had to like go in and like perform a procedure at the elevator.
[37:01.070 --> 37:05.970]  I can block it off with two people and to wait for a dude to come in on Sunday to do it.
[37:06.150 --> 37:07.530]  She got her fucking keys back.
[37:07.790 --> 37:10.030]  And I guess they had been sitting in water the entire time.
[37:12.150 --> 37:16.150]  I have been holding in a laugh since that moment.
[37:16.150 --> 37:21.630]  Watching the fucking... I... It's been the hardest.
[37:22.110 --> 37:25.730]  I've been such a supportive guy, such a supportive boyfriend.
[37:25.990 --> 37:30.730]  I haven't made a joke or laughed about it or even snickered.
[37:31.410 --> 37:35.150]  I've just been very conciliatory, very calm and understanding.
[37:35.870 --> 37:37.050]  This did not go well.
[37:37.330 --> 37:39.990]  She was not happy, but oh my God, is it funny.
[37:40.490 --> 37:41.050]  That's incredible.
[37:41.330 --> 37:43.110]  That's my little story.
[37:43.110 --> 37:50.290]  Why don't they have a nice little catchment trough that's directly under the doors that just mails it out to you?
[37:50.490 --> 37:51.250]  I know.
[37:51.430 --> 37:57.210]  Because I feel like I know so many people who've dropped stuff straight down between the floors.
[37:57.770 --> 38:00.770]  Well, that's what I was telling her. I was like, I bet this happens all the time.
[38:00.950 --> 38:04.430]  Like they probably are like jumping to action because they're like, it happens twice a week.
[38:04.830 --> 38:09.530]  Your brain went catchment trough, mine went long sticks with magnets on them.
[38:09.590 --> 38:11.190]  That's what I want. Just magnet up.
[38:11.830 --> 38:14.950]  You don't want the people to have to do work.
[38:15.230 --> 38:19.390]  No, it's fun. It's not fun. It's fun when it's work.
[38:19.750 --> 38:22.170]  I've said that the opposite of what I wanted to say.
[38:22.250 --> 38:25.370]  When it's fun, it isn't work. That's just the game.
[38:25.450 --> 38:28.210]  And you can maybe get somebody else's stuff. You don't know what's down there.
[38:28.270 --> 38:32.990]  I don't know. I feel like I'd feel iffy like pissing about between the floors.
[38:33.150 --> 38:36.710]  What if the lift drops and Resident Evil is you or something?
[38:37.190 --> 38:37.550]  No!
[38:38.170 --> 38:39.210]  Or Mission Impossible 1.
[38:39.210 --> 38:40.730]  Well, maybe. Hmm.
[38:40.970 --> 38:41.930]  Can we throw a camera?
[38:42.790 --> 38:45.170]  Yeah, that was on the top. Like the reverse of a Mission Impossible.
[38:45.390 --> 38:46.050]  I guess not.
[38:47.910 --> 38:51.670]  So Mission Impossible is one where somebody gets killed at the top of an elevator.
[38:51.930 --> 38:58.670]  Well, I think the catchment brakes go through his face as he's looking up at them.
[38:59.110 --> 38:59.810]  Yes, they do.
[39:00.110 --> 39:03.350]  But that's a death at the top. What is a death at the bottom?
[39:03.450 --> 39:04.510]  Can you think of a movie or something?
[39:04.630 --> 39:09.090]  I feel like it's harder to think of being crushed by an elevator than it is...
[39:09.090 --> 39:12.410]  I've seen some YouTube videos, but I can't think of any movies.
[39:13.650 --> 39:17.390]  What do you mean by that? Like you've seen it happen in real life on YouTube?
[39:17.750 --> 39:18.070]  Yeah.
[39:18.250 --> 39:19.430]  Oh, that's terrible.
[39:19.430 --> 39:20.110]  You've never seen security camera footage?
[39:20.290 --> 39:20.670]  No!
[39:20.770 --> 39:22.790]  No, I'm not. Yeah, no.
[39:22.850 --> 39:24.050]  People getting squashed.
[39:25.110 --> 39:30.210]  Well, like a drunk person opening up the door and there's nothing there and they just fall through.
[39:30.650 --> 39:35.030]  It happens in Oz, but I can't think of a movie where it happens.
[39:35.030 --> 39:39.130]  I can't think of a scene... and it must have. It must have happened.
[39:39.770 --> 39:44.590]  I can think of scenes where people have fallen with the elevator, but never below the elevator.
[39:45.090 --> 39:45.870]  Oh, here we go.
[39:46.010 --> 39:50.990]  Where a guy falls down an elevator. Okay, let's look at the... let's open this link up.
[39:51.050 --> 39:59.590]  Because there's a movie called Twelve Rounds with John Cena and he's trying to hold a guy up and he can't lift him and he falls with the elevator and the guy dies.
[39:59.790 --> 40:01.070]  But that's not being below it.
[40:01.070 --> 40:06.170]  Oh, this guy has gone on this whole spree about, I'm thinking of a movie where a guy falls down an elevator shaft.
[40:06.270 --> 40:10.090]  The first comment says, I think it's Marked for Death with Steven Seagal.
[40:10.150 --> 40:10.570]  What?
[40:10.830 --> 40:11.290]  Steven Seagal.
[40:11.570 --> 40:11.950]  Yeah.
[40:12.150 --> 40:12.670]  Steven Seagal.
[40:14.450 --> 40:15.330]  My favorite.
[40:16.070 --> 40:21.970]  Steven Seagal. And then the link to the scene. And the guy who wrote the post said, that's it. Turns out it wasn't an elevator shaft.
[40:22.370 --> 40:22.590]  What?
[40:23.170 --> 40:23.470]  What?
[40:25.030 --> 40:33.090]  That's somehow more disappointing than my resolution of clicking the video link and being told video content from Fox has blocked it on copyright grounds.
[40:33.090 --> 40:33.310]  Oh, yeah.
[40:33.310 --> 40:33.870]  It's unavailable.
[40:34.150 --> 40:34.970]  I can't see it either.
[40:35.330 --> 40:35.410]  Wait.
[40:35.550 --> 40:35.630]  Yeah.
[40:36.370 --> 40:39.010]  Screw face crucifixion? What does that mean?
[40:39.430 --> 40:41.130]  Is that what the video is called? I already clicked away.
[40:41.690 --> 40:41.770]  Sounds awful.
[40:41.770 --> 40:49.170]  Doesn't sound like a good time. I don't think... yeah, I can think of so many ways in which people have died in elevators that aren't related to being below it.
[40:49.170 --> 40:56.850]  I got someone falling down a shaft. I got Final Destination 2. Getting your head cut off in the elevator. Can't think of anything below it.
[40:57.230 --> 41:01.170]  I would say it's rarer than a person impersonating a character they're playing in a movie.
[41:03.750 --> 41:08.990]  Yeah, when one actor has to impersonate another because the original one got squashed by a lift.
[41:09.470 --> 41:14.750]  Has that never happened in James Bond? That feels like a thing that would have happened at some point in James Bond to somebody.
[41:15.210 --> 41:16.710]  What? Someone impersonated someone else?
[41:16.710 --> 41:19.710]  Yeah, no, someone getting fucking crushed by a lift.
[41:21.770 --> 41:23.050]  That's probably happened.
[41:23.410 --> 41:26.990]  Yeah, I'd assume it exists. It's somewhere.
[41:27.690 --> 41:30.070]  Well, thank God it didn't happen on Sunday, I'll tell you that.
[41:30.670 --> 41:33.530]  So that was what, the night before Thanksgiving, Geoff?
[41:33.770 --> 41:33.990]  Yeah.
[41:34.710 --> 41:38.330]  Like the worst time going into a holiday?
[41:38.950 --> 41:38.970]  Yeah.
[41:38.970 --> 41:39.790]  What's your question, Eric?
[41:40.530 --> 41:47.730]  I wanted to know specifically if Andrew calls it a lift or an elevator. I don't know where British English stops and starts in Canada.
[41:48.270 --> 41:49.350]  Yeah, it's definitely an elevator.
[41:50.030 --> 41:52.970]  If it was just Gavin and I, though, I think I'd say lift.
[41:53.790 --> 41:55.010]  Is that just for my benefit?
[41:55.430 --> 41:59.030]  Yeah, just for you, because I know how you, like, your language, I know how you speak.
[41:59.690 --> 42:02.890]  But if we were in a group, we're in a group setting, I would say elevator.
[42:03.250 --> 42:10.410]  Well, Gavin, let me ask you a question. If it was just you and Andrew, you know how he speaks, would you say elevator to make him comfortable?
[42:10.870 --> 42:11.070]  Yeah.
[42:11.650 --> 42:17.150]  Okay, that's not like I do that a lot when I'm here, where it's like, oh, could you take out the trash?
[42:17.570 --> 42:18.910]  I would never say that on my own.
[42:19.450 --> 42:21.110]  I'm just glad to see it goes both ways.
[42:21.430 --> 42:27.490]  Well, no, we can't. That doesn't work. We're just saying it in a way in which we don't normally say it to the other person.
[42:27.930 --> 42:34.550]  If I'm calling it a lift and you're calling it an elevator, well, then I just feel like we're both just like, what are we doing at that point?
[42:35.030 --> 42:37.130]  There needs to be, it can't go both ways.
[42:37.210 --> 42:39.750]  I'll tell you what you're doing. He's being British and you're being Canadian.
[42:42.150 --> 42:44.190]  It's got to be give and take both ways.
[42:44.690 --> 42:48.390]  No, it just has to be one way or else then what's the point of changing the word?
[42:48.430 --> 42:49.470]  What do you want to do with the heavy lifting then?
[42:50.150 --> 42:53.450]  I don't really care. We can flip a coin. It just can't go both ways.
[42:54.570 --> 42:56.130]  It has to be only one way.
[42:56.130 --> 42:59.550]  I think it's the ultimate sign of respect to go both ways.
[42:59.750 --> 43:04.430]  I just feel like we're both just saying things we wouldn't normally say at that point and like, what are we doing?
[43:04.810 --> 43:12.050]  Yeah, Eric has a good suggestion. Flip a coin every time we hang out and that will determine who takes over all of the politeness.
[43:12.650 --> 43:13.770]  Okay, I like that.
[43:14.410 --> 43:21.990]  Or what if you pick words like lift and elevator and we flip a coin now and then whichever way it goes, that's just how we have to use that word forever.
[43:22.770 --> 43:24.150]  Forever? That's the...
[43:24.150 --> 43:24.850]  Yeah, whatever.
[43:25.650 --> 43:31.630]  Like in the context of any of us hanging out, from now until perpetuity, we'd have to say elevator.
[43:32.050 --> 43:38.010]  Do you want to just pick one word right now and I can flip a coin and heads you say it one way and tails you say it the other way?
[43:38.490 --> 43:39.330]  You just pick one word.
[43:39.710 --> 43:40.750]  Can we do trash and rubbish?
[43:41.630 --> 43:44.270]  Sure. Gavin, do you want trash or rubbish to be heads?
[43:44.910 --> 43:46.250]  Let's put rubbish on tails.
[43:47.010 --> 43:50.190]  Rubbish is tails, trash is heads, the coin is flip... what?
[43:50.710 --> 43:52.610]  I don't know if I can adopt rubbish.
[43:52.610 --> 43:53.330]  Why?
[43:54.290 --> 43:55.450]  I just don't.
[43:55.550 --> 43:56.390]  That one's off the table.
[43:56.470 --> 43:58.870]  I don't think I can be a rubbish guy.
[44:00.190 --> 44:04.610]  So your conciliatory nature has a limit.
[44:05.130 --> 44:05.750]  It does.
[44:06.070 --> 44:07.070]  You're not a rubbish guy.
[44:07.830 --> 44:11.190]  Because there's another one, edge ways, edge wise.
[44:11.990 --> 44:15.590]  I've never understood edge wise. What does that mean?
[44:16.110 --> 44:22.050]  I don't know what it means, but it's just I can't be a ways person. I've been a wise person too long. I can't make that change.
[44:22.050 --> 44:23.990]  Geoff, I assume you're also edge wise.
[44:24.610 --> 44:25.610]  I'm edge wise.
[44:25.970 --> 44:26.750]  What does that mean?
[44:27.270 --> 44:30.210]  The dictionary definition, with the edge, uppermost, or toward the viewer.
[44:30.810 --> 44:31.170]  What?
[44:31.690 --> 44:36.270]  That's the definition. It's an adverb. With the edge, uppermost, or toward the viewer.
[44:36.750 --> 44:36.990]  Huh.
[44:37.010 --> 44:42.330]  I always heard, like, I can't get a word in edge ways. Like, I can't even squeeze a word in, like, a different way.
[44:42.510 --> 44:44.830]  You say, no, I didn't get a word in edge wise.
[44:45.410 --> 44:46.290]  What does that mean?
[44:46.910 --> 44:53.210]  How is it wise? Like, imagine saying I can't get a word in sideways, but you say side wise. What does that mean?
[44:53.810 --> 45:02.410]  Well, the phrase to get a word in edge wise means to contribute to a conversation with difficulty because the other speaker talks almost without a pause.
[45:02.510 --> 45:04.830]  Well, yeah, that's what edge wise means.
[45:05.230 --> 45:06.410]  That's what edge wise means.
[45:06.890 --> 45:12.650]  But that's what edge wise means is what I'm saying. Is it just like a miscommunication across the ocean?
[45:12.650 --> 45:18.370]  Yeah, I feel like it's, uh, I couldn't care less. I could care less. Like, people are just misusing.
[45:18.590 --> 45:27.250]  What does this say here, Eric? No, Nick wrote definition of edge wise. One, sideways. Even the definition is ways.
[45:28.190 --> 45:32.250]  Also, uh, I googled edge ways and it's not a word. It doesn't come up.
[45:32.850 --> 45:33.730]  It's two words.
[45:36.170 --> 45:38.910]  Edge wise is one word. Edge ways is two words.
[45:39.430 --> 45:40.630]  This is so dumb.
[45:41.270 --> 45:42.650]  Edge ways isn't in there.
[45:42.690 --> 45:44.350]  It's not a phrase. You made it up.
[45:44.450 --> 45:46.010]  No one on earth says edge wage.
[45:46.570 --> 45:46.930]  Edge wage.
[45:51.570 --> 45:55.970]  Google has edge waste is what Google thinks I'm saying.
[45:59.580 --> 46:00.460]  It's not a word.
[46:00.460 --> 46:03.780]  I'm really glad I didn't just go with rubbish. I'm so glad.
[46:05.380 --> 46:08.020]  What's weird about my rubbish rules is...
[46:08.020 --> 46:08.620]  Edge ways.
[46:10.520 --> 46:11.600]  Think about it.
[46:11.700 --> 46:13.340]  That makes way more sense.
[46:13.960 --> 46:14.800]  It does.
[46:15.140 --> 46:16.340]  I understand what he's saying.
[46:16.960 --> 46:18.540]  Unfortunately, Google doesn't.
[46:19.120 --> 46:19.880]  What do you mean?
[46:20.120 --> 46:21.880]  No, I don't think you know what you're googling.
[46:22.700 --> 46:24.320]  I don't think you understand what you're doing.
[46:24.760 --> 46:25.520]  Tell me what to Google.
[46:25.960 --> 46:29.180]  I don't have the answer to that either, but I don't think you know either.
[46:29.500 --> 46:30.340]  Gavin, tell me what to Google.
[46:30.460 --> 46:35.480]  Why would a different version of edge ways be sideways, but edge wise is also sideways?
[46:36.080 --> 46:36.480]  Okay.
[46:36.480 --> 46:38.340]  Just tell me how to spell edge ways.
[46:38.780 --> 46:42.440]  E-T-G-E hyphen W-I-S-E.
[46:42.700 --> 46:43.840]  W-A-S-E.
[46:43.940 --> 46:44.400]  What?
[46:47.060 --> 46:50.320]  You see, when I do that, it comes up edge wise.
[46:52.060 --> 46:56.080]  E-T-G-E hyphen W-A-Y-S.
[46:56.600 --> 46:58.920]  I was reading...
[47:00.440 --> 47:01.760]  My brain's mellow.
[47:02.160 --> 47:03.500]  I was reading what Nick wrote.
[47:06.850 --> 47:08.350]  What are you talking about?
[47:09.590 --> 47:10.990]  What's wrong with the hyphen, Eric?
[47:11.690 --> 47:14.890]  It just wasn't... I thought we were talking about one word.
[47:15.090 --> 47:19.110]  Is edge waste the right... I don't know. I'm confused now.
[47:19.430 --> 47:20.610]  That's what happens when you Google it.
[47:20.850 --> 47:23.110]  But that says... that's W-A-S-E.
[47:23.810 --> 47:25.030]  Yeah, edge way.
[47:25.370 --> 47:27.910]  That might have been what I said when I was saying it wrong. Hold on.
[47:28.130 --> 47:31.110]  I really... edge ways!
[47:31.110 --> 47:35.530]  Hey, I do want to say, Geoff, you're doing your best with this, and I'm proud of you.
[47:35.690 --> 47:36.410]  Like, sideways.
[47:37.890 --> 47:39.670]  Thanks, man. I really appreciate it.
[47:39.870 --> 47:40.670]  I'm doing my best.
[47:41.070 --> 47:47.010]  The issue isn't that it's two words. It's not a singular word for the expression.
[47:47.410 --> 47:51.010]  He's saying, like, the way in which the edge of the thing is facing.
[47:51.330 --> 47:52.050]  Right? Like a knife?
[47:52.330 --> 47:53.950]  Maybe there's no hyphen, Eric. I don't know.
[47:54.510 --> 47:56.010]  Maybe it's just edge ways is one word.
[47:57.730 --> 47:58.670]  This is a mess.
[47:59.390 --> 48:02.150]  I'm Googled out, buddy. Whoa, edge cool.
[48:02.310 --> 48:06.850]  If you said something was facing backwards, would you say backwards or backwise?
[48:18.530 --> 48:20.310]  I just wanted to flip a coin.
[48:20.670 --> 48:22.970]  Alright, so trash is heads, tails is rubber.
[48:24.490 --> 48:28.950]  Before we do this, you told me everyone in Europe says edge ways.
[48:31.230 --> 48:33.890]  Is that a lie? Are you just the only edge ways guy?
[48:33.890 --> 48:35.090]  To what extent?
[48:35.350 --> 48:37.510]  I feel like everyone in England says edge ways.
[48:37.830 --> 48:40.130]  Okay, there we go. Now I'm back on the team.
[48:40.270 --> 48:43.150]  You just really have to forget the first time I tried to spell it.
[48:43.250 --> 48:44.430]  Ignore that. That was all wrong.
[48:46.250 --> 48:52.010]  Also, I wanted to point out that when I couldn't pronounce that name, it was because it was spelt wrong.
[48:54.430 --> 48:58.630]  It was Stephen S-E-G-A-L, and that was what confused me.
[48:59.190 --> 49:00.950]  Alright, what else? What other corrections do we have?
[49:00.950 --> 49:03.910]  A lot of stuff's confusing you lately, huh?
[49:04.490 --> 49:06.670]  Yeah, I don't know why. Maybe I didn't open a window or something.
[49:07.250 --> 49:07.670]  Tails.
[49:08.210 --> 49:11.650]  Can I tell you guys about a billboard I saw?
[49:12.270 --> 49:13.350]  Oh, right, we gotta flip the coin.
[49:13.810 --> 49:14.450]  We still doing that?
[49:14.870 --> 49:17.990]  Andrew, can you abide by the rules of rubbish and trash?
[49:17.990 --> 49:24.690]  Okay, yeah, the rules of rubbish and trash for me, I would never call garbage rubbish.
[49:25.170 --> 49:30.430]  But I would call somebody who's playing poorly at a game rubbish.
[49:30.430 --> 49:33.690]  I would call someone their trash, as in rubbish.
[49:34.010 --> 49:37.650]  What is the name of the receptacle that you would put rubbish in?
[49:38.270 --> 49:39.710]  It's a trash can.
[49:40.130 --> 49:44.150]  Yeah, in America it's a trash can, but now we'll have to call it a rubbish bin, right?
[49:44.290 --> 49:46.590]  Yeah, rubbish bin. So it's like a two-fold.
[49:47.230 --> 49:51.650]  I didn't realize garborator wasn't a universal term. That was a weird one for me.
[49:52.150 --> 49:53.210]  What? Huh?
[49:53.550 --> 49:57.830]  Is that not a Europe thing? A garborator?
[49:58.370 --> 50:00.390]  Is that like what Garbo Man uses?
[50:01.990 --> 50:03.950]  What do you think a garborator is, Geoff?
[50:04.710 --> 50:07.770]  What do I think? I think it's probably a garbage disposal?
[50:08.690 --> 50:11.930]  Yeah, exactly. That's exactly what it is. This was the thing in the sink.
[50:12.350 --> 50:14.490]  Garborator might be a brand name.
[50:14.970 --> 50:18.310]  Is it? I've only ever heard it referred to as a garborator.
[50:18.790 --> 50:22.870]  I called a garborator, sent it to a group of people, they had no idea what I was talking about.
[50:22.870 --> 50:23.810]  And it shot them.
[50:25.930 --> 50:28.770]  Group of people from a different country. Very specific to point out.
[50:30.110 --> 50:31.910]  It's a Canadian thing.
[50:32.690 --> 50:36.330]  And is that a pun off carborator?
[50:36.790 --> 50:45.090]  I have no idea the origin. It could be, but I don't know the definitive origin. I haven't done my research on the history of the term garborator.
[50:45.610 --> 50:46.630]  But that's what we call it.
[50:47.430 --> 50:49.130]  Imagine if we were all from America.
[50:49.410 --> 50:51.470]  Okay, so are you abiding by rubbish bin?
[50:52.070 --> 50:53.070]  Yeah, he's got to.
[50:55.450 --> 51:04.610]  So if I lose this coin toss, I can never say trash in any context in which I would normally say. I'd have to replace it with rubbish.
[51:05.050 --> 51:07.650]  And if it's the other way, you have to do the same, but reverse.
[51:07.970 --> 51:11.170]  Whenever you would use the word rubbish, you have to say trash now.
[51:11.430 --> 51:14.530]  Yeah, but I would like to point out that you potentially haven't listened again.
[51:15.510 --> 51:17.710]  Because you called tails on my tails.
[51:18.370 --> 51:19.350]  Oh, you called tails?
[51:19.850 --> 51:20.410]  He did.
[51:21.270 --> 51:23.810]  Okay, well then it's heads, and I just won. I'm looking at heads.
[51:23.970 --> 51:31.610]  No, I haven't flipped it yet. That's why I just shared my screen so that way we can see it, and then you don't call deception, and then it's a whole thing that I have to get lawyers involved.
[51:31.850 --> 51:39.070]  Okay, well, no, just one second. Who's the away person here? Who's more... I think I'm away, so I get to call the toss.
[51:39.170 --> 51:39.910]  What are you away from?
[51:41.250 --> 51:48.650]  Everyone else in this place is in the same place, in the same city. I'm the furthest... I'm the only one not in the same country.
[51:49.250 --> 51:50.430]  It's true, you're the away person.
[51:50.430 --> 51:52.010]  But we're the most north.
[51:52.310 --> 51:58.010]  But you're both... but you're all from North America. I'm the away on the phrasing.
[51:58.030 --> 51:59.810]  Yeah, but you currently live there.
[51:59.830 --> 52:01.550]  I'm playing away. I live away.
[52:05.030 --> 52:06.870]  You call it. You stick with tails?
[52:07.590 --> 52:08.530]  No, you can have tails if you want.
[52:08.710 --> 52:09.310]  Okay, I'll take heads.
[52:09.670 --> 52:13.350]  I feel like Eric is sharing his screen, and it's a virtual coin. I want a real coin.
[52:13.670 --> 52:14.810]  Yeah, I also kind of want a real coin.
[52:14.810 --> 52:17.170]  I can go run and get... you want me to run and get a real coin?
[52:17.390 --> 52:17.510]  Yeah.
[52:17.510 --> 52:18.510]  Get a real coin, please.
[52:18.670 --> 52:21.650]  While he's doing that, let me tell you a funny billboard I saw.
[52:22.310 --> 52:24.230]  I'd love to hear about your funny billboard.
[52:24.230 --> 52:26.070]  It's just a very brief thing I saw.
[52:26.310 --> 52:28.990]  I saw a billboard yesterday on i35 that said,
[52:29.510 --> 52:33.130]  Keep Austin weird, which is, you know, a fucking stupid phrase we've had for 25 years.
[52:33.470 --> 52:36.470]  Keep Austin weird, like high cost of living weird.
[52:36.930 --> 52:37.310]  Ohio!
[52:38.430 --> 52:43.490]  It was a billboard advertising people... advertising another state.
[52:43.490 --> 52:50.930]  The state of Ohio is spending money on billboards in Austin trying to tell people to leave Austin to move to Ohio.
[52:51.690 --> 52:54.010]  States are trying to poach each other.
[52:54.630 --> 52:57.470]  That's how you know you fucking made it as a city,
[52:57.610 --> 53:05.350]  when an entire state on the other side of the country spends thousands of dollars to try to convince the people that live here to move there instead.
[53:05.490 --> 53:06.930]  That's fucking ludicrous.
[53:07.350 --> 53:09.150]  I feel like that's not what's happening.
[53:09.290 --> 53:11.370]  I think that's an Austin billboard.
[53:11.370 --> 53:12.830]  I think they're trying to convince people to leave.
[53:13.710 --> 53:14.910]  Do you think so?
[53:15.350 --> 53:18.530]  Yeah, if Austin was smart, they'd put up those exact billboards.
[53:19.190 --> 53:22.110]  It was funded by Austinites who've lived here for more than two years.
[53:24.810 --> 53:26.530]  Could you imagine...
[53:28.490 --> 53:28.850]  Goddamn.
[53:29.830 --> 53:34.890]  Could you imagine being in like... like you're just walking around London, like in, I don't know, Shoreditch or something,
[53:34.990 --> 53:37.670]  and there's just a big billboard that's like, Norwich! Give it a try!
[53:41.090 --> 53:46.470]  Okay, Eric has coins. Are we doing multiple tosses? Are we doing like a best of five on this coin toss?
[53:46.670 --> 53:51.050]  No, I think it's one and done. I just... here's the thing. Here's what happened.
[53:52.090 --> 53:55.510]  I know how you operate because we've done 81 episodes of this show.
[53:55.830 --> 53:59.370]  So, I've chosen one of every coin.
[54:01.390 --> 54:05.250]  So I have... I'm gonna let you choose or you guys can come to a consensus.
[54:05.390 --> 54:07.330]  I have a penny. I have a nickel.
[54:07.850 --> 54:09.390]  I have a dime.
[54:09.670 --> 54:10.630]  Okay, that's three.
[54:10.870 --> 54:11.710]  I have a quarter.
[54:12.450 --> 54:12.650]  Four.
[54:13.330 --> 54:14.910]  And I have a half dollar.
[54:15.330 --> 54:18.110]  Okay, you have five. So just flip all of them and we'll do best of five.
[54:18.530 --> 54:19.710]  What do they call the half dollar?
[54:19.870 --> 54:21.270]  Yeah, just flip all of them.
[54:21.370 --> 54:21.630]  What's that?
[54:21.790 --> 54:22.210]  Flip all of them.
[54:23.210 --> 54:25.370]  Like, why do I have a half dollar? I don't know.
[54:25.610 --> 54:26.850]  Do they have a special name for it?
[54:27.450 --> 54:28.050]  Half dollar.
[54:29.310 --> 54:31.610]  It says half dollar on it.
[54:31.930 --> 54:32.190]  Okay.
[54:32.570 --> 54:33.090]  Hard to see.
[54:34.150 --> 54:36.390]  Okay, are we flipping all five?
[54:36.950 --> 54:40.830]  All five and we'll take a pause between. We can reevaluate if you want to maintain heads or tails.
[54:41.130 --> 54:42.950]  Do you have a top-down angle?
[54:43.450 --> 54:44.830]  I can try to do one.
[54:45.610 --> 54:46.230]  Oh, that's great.
[54:46.610 --> 54:47.210]  How's that?
[54:47.350 --> 54:47.810]  Yeah, that works.
[54:47.850 --> 54:48.210]  Fantastic.
[54:48.690 --> 54:54.430]  Cool. Okay. Here's the penny. We are saying heads is...
[54:54.430 --> 54:56.310]  I'm tails. Andrew's is tails.
[54:56.870 --> 54:57.330]  What does that...
[54:57.330 --> 55:02.070]  So trash is heads. No, rubbish is heads. Trash is tails. Is that right?
[55:02.070 --> 55:03.070]  Yes, that is correct.
[55:03.270 --> 55:04.450]  Rubbish is heads. Trash is tails.
[55:04.850 --> 55:06.690]  Rubbish is heads. Trash is tails.
[55:08.350 --> 55:10.170]  Am I catching it or letting it hit the table?
[55:10.450 --> 55:11.190]  Let it hit the table.
[55:11.590 --> 55:13.670]  Okay, just making sure. Here we go.
[55:15.690 --> 55:16.730]  It is heads.
[55:17.170 --> 55:17.450]  Fuck.
[55:17.530 --> 55:17.790]  Oh!
[55:18.470 --> 55:18.950]  Fuck.
[55:19.870 --> 55:22.970]  Rubbish has... I'll have a sheet of paper.
[55:23.050 --> 55:24.310]  I'm gonna hold.
[55:24.390 --> 55:26.330]  That's one for rubbish.
[55:27.150 --> 55:31.250]  Rubbish has one. Trash has none so far.
[55:31.250 --> 55:34.070]  I'm gonna hold tails. I'm gonna hold tails on the next toss. I'm just gonna go with the odds.
[55:34.090 --> 55:37.190]  We have a nickel. Heads. Tails.
[55:38.270 --> 55:42.330]  We said rubbish is heads. Trash is tails. We are holding. Here's the flip.
[55:44.230 --> 55:45.210]  It is heads.
[55:45.630 --> 55:45.950]  Fuck.
[55:46.110 --> 55:47.450]  Oh, hell yeah.
[55:48.270 --> 55:49.110]  Two for rubbish.
[55:49.110 --> 55:54.250]  There's no way. I'm sticking with tails. There's no way that I lose three times in a row.
[55:55.710 --> 55:56.850]  It can't happen.
[55:58.310 --> 56:01.910]  This is gonna be a comeback of the ages on this flip. What is this, a quarter?
[56:02.150 --> 56:03.370]  This is a dime.
[56:03.710 --> 56:04.590]  We're doing a dime.
[56:04.970 --> 56:08.850]  This is the smallest. This is the smallest of all of the coins.
[56:09.910 --> 56:11.750]  It is wheat or something on the back.
[56:12.530 --> 56:17.290]  Rubbish is heads. Trash is tails. We are saying that is holding. Here we go.
[56:18.630 --> 56:19.690]  Oh, it went off.
[56:20.850 --> 56:22.130]  What did it land on?
[56:22.350 --> 56:23.130]  It landed on flip.
[56:23.350 --> 56:24.910]  It's out of bounds. Doesn't matter.
[56:24.910 --> 56:26.810]  I agree, it should be out of bounds and I won't tell you.
[56:26.830 --> 56:27.590]  I agree, but I...
[56:27.590 --> 56:28.770]  I will not tell you.
[56:29.030 --> 56:30.190]  Out of bounds, I won't tell you.
[56:30.330 --> 56:32.430]  It could influence your answer.
[56:32.570 --> 56:33.790]  It could influence your answer.
[56:33.890 --> 56:36.290]  It could influence your answer. I'm not counting it.
[56:36.550 --> 56:37.570]  No, I'm locked in.
[56:37.970 --> 56:38.690]  You're locked in?
[56:38.730 --> 56:40.130]  None of us are allowed to know. It's fine.
[56:40.810 --> 56:41.970]  I'll tell you afterwards.
[56:42.350 --> 56:42.630]  Okay.
[56:42.750 --> 56:43.070]  Here we go.
[56:45.790 --> 56:46.090]  Andrew.
[56:47.510 --> 56:47.870]  Andrew.
[56:48.070 --> 56:48.610]  What? Yeah.
[56:49.330 --> 56:50.350]  You're not gonna like this.
[56:51.130 --> 56:54.510]  Well, am I not gonna like the fact that it was tails and you flipped it again?
[56:54.510 --> 56:56.110]  Is that what I'm not gonna like?
[56:56.650 --> 56:57.350]  It's three heads in a row.
[56:57.530 --> 56:58.410]  It has landed on heads.
[56:58.690 --> 56:59.830]  What was it on the floor?
[57:00.310 --> 57:02.890]  On the floor, it was heads.
[57:05.210 --> 57:06.090]  I suck.
[57:06.830 --> 57:07.470]  I'm terrible.
[57:09.070 --> 57:11.390]  Flip the rest. Flip the other two, please.
[57:11.410 --> 57:12.950]  This is the luck I was talking about, Andrew.
[57:13.370 --> 57:13.630]  Okay.
[57:14.170 --> 57:16.690]  Do you wanna change?
[57:16.990 --> 57:18.290]  No, no, I'm gonna hold tails.
[57:18.830 --> 57:20.590]  It's gotta be tails eventually.
[57:21.050 --> 57:21.670]  Oh, it's off.
[57:22.170 --> 57:23.050]  Does it count?
[57:23.050 --> 57:23.950]  Does it count?
[57:24.510 --> 57:25.850]  It's a false. It's a redo.
[57:26.250 --> 57:26.950]  It's a heads.
[57:29.630 --> 57:30.590]  No way.
[57:30.830 --> 57:31.350]  I swear to God.
[57:31.770 --> 57:31.930]  No way.
[57:32.150 --> 57:32.690]  Hey, Andrew.
[57:32.970 --> 57:34.930]  When it fell off, it landed on heads.
[57:36.630 --> 57:37.550]  Fuck off.
[57:37.570 --> 57:37.910]  Heads.
[57:38.210 --> 57:40.930]  There's no way I lose seven in a row.
[57:41.310 --> 57:41.730]  Tails.
[57:41.750 --> 57:41.930]  Ready?
[57:42.830 --> 57:43.310]  Tails.
[57:43.530 --> 57:43.770]  Here it comes.
[57:45.650 --> 57:45.930]  Oh.
[57:48.430 --> 57:49.670]  It rolled off. Here we go.
[57:49.830 --> 57:50.270]  It rolled off.
[57:52.310 --> 57:53.110]  What is it?
[57:53.450 --> 57:53.810]  Yep.
[57:54.490 --> 57:55.150]  It's landed on heads.
[57:55.910 --> 57:57.370]  Fucking no way.
[57:57.730 --> 57:58.710]  There's no way.
[57:58.870 --> 58:00.030]  What did it land on the floor?
[58:00.470 --> 58:01.310]  On the floor?
[58:01.750 --> 58:02.230]  Yeah.
[58:02.770 --> 58:04.890]  On the floor, it landed on tails.
[58:05.450 --> 58:06.170]  There we go.
[58:06.290 --> 58:07.130]  So we got one.
[58:07.370 --> 58:08.170]  I had one tails.
[58:08.170 --> 58:08.850]  No, no, you didn't get any.
[58:09.270 --> 58:09.670]  You got none.
[58:10.010 --> 58:13.170]  Well, no, but it landed, like, at least you flipped it eight times.
[58:13.830 --> 58:17.110]  And, I'll say this, at no point was it a sock.
[58:19.790 --> 58:21.670]  Which is still for sale in our store.
[58:21.770 --> 58:23.790]  Buy them eleven and a half months early for next Christmas.
[58:24.670 --> 58:30.150]  I like that heads was open, and I'd already picked tails, and then you picked tails, so I had to go for heads.
[58:30.530 --> 58:31.590]  If you'd have just listened.
[58:35.910 --> 58:36.530]  God damn.
[58:36.530 --> 58:38.610]  I like tails. I had a good feeling about tails.
[58:38.770 --> 58:42.170]  Talk about snatching defeat from the claws of victory.
[58:42.550 --> 58:44.590]  That's the best luck I've ever had from heads, I'll be honest.
[58:44.670 --> 58:45.710]  I'm usually a tails guy.
[58:46.050 --> 58:46.210]  Yeah.
[58:46.210 --> 58:46.590]  Every time.
[58:47.130 --> 58:48.510]  I was surprised, I'm a tails guy too.
[58:49.250 --> 58:49.850]  Worst luck.
[58:50.130 --> 58:56.510]  What is the NFL, hasn't the Superbowl, it's been the same thing for like 18 years or whatever on their coin toss?
[58:56.870 --> 58:57.650]  Is that heads or tails?
[58:58.130 --> 58:58.730]  No way.
[58:59.070 --> 58:59.930]  That's what I should have went in.
[59:00.490 --> 59:03.670]  Yeah, it's been like the same, I don't think I'm making that up.
[59:03.710 --> 59:07.690]  I think for like an extended period of time, it has been the same call every time that has won.
[59:08.510 --> 59:10.470]  I'll just go back through the last five.
[59:11.090 --> 59:13.990]  Heads, tails, heads, heads, tails.
[59:14.630 --> 59:16.130]  Okay, I just made that up apparently.
[59:16.290 --> 59:17.110]  I thought that was the thing.
[59:17.330 --> 59:19.310]  I thought it was like a lock every year.
[59:19.930 --> 59:21.710]  I thought that was the thing, I was wrong about that.
[59:22.130 --> 59:23.150]  I was clearly incorrect.
[59:23.590 --> 59:24.130]  Hey, Andrew?
[59:24.570 --> 59:24.930]  Yes?
[59:25.370 --> 59:27.770]  When you're done with your apple, where are you going to throw it?
[59:29.050 --> 59:29.730]  The rubbish.
[59:33.940 --> 59:35.220]  I mean, you could compost.
[59:36.100 --> 59:36.640]  That's true.
[59:36.900 --> 59:38.500]  No, I will actually, I will compost it.
[59:38.600 --> 59:40.040]  That's right, that's actually the correct answer.
[59:40.620 --> 59:44.540]  Why don't you pop one of those cosmic cribs in your mouth and see what's up?
[59:44.540 --> 59:45.920]  We're doing this, this is the finale.
[59:46.160 --> 59:46.780]  We're doing the big finale.
[59:46.900 --> 59:48.540]  I'm going to finally taste this cosmic crisp.
[59:49.380 --> 59:50.320]  This is exciting.
[59:50.520 --> 59:52.080]  I've been waiting days to do this.
[59:52.140 --> 59:52.980]  I thought I did it once.
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.020]  I get to relive the experience a second time.
[59:55.080 --> 59:55.860]  How lucky am I?
[59:56.420 --> 59:56.980]  Here we go.
[59:57.560 --> 59:58.700]  Oh, Nick recorded the video.
[59:58.800 --> 59:59.220]  That's awesome.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:00.640]  That's awesome.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.640]  Oh, that was a nice big crunch.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.220]  I heard that.
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.120]  This is so juicy.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.720]  He's got the right one.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.280]  We got the crunch and the juice.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.560]  He's eating the right apple.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.000]  Holy shit.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.760]  Don't choke, chew.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.120]  I was laughing, I choked on the juice.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.400]  This is a delicious apple.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.040]  This is really good.
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:41.360]  Oh, we may have figured out the third apple now that's in his top seven.
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.140]  No, this is so... wow.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.880]  You might have to kick one out.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.140]  That's the thing.
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.480]  Secretly, Pink Lady was my number one apple.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.780]  I love a Pink Lady.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.240]  I think it's a fantastic apple for so many reasons.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:55.740]  Wait, wait.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.940]  You ate your favorite apple and couldn't tell you were eating it.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:03.220]  Well, yeah, because there's a variation of it.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.460]  I love a Pink Lady.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.500]  I thought that's how good the Cosmic Crisp was.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.180]  I was like, this is a delicious apple.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.960]  But having the back-to-back, unknowingly, originally,
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.520]  I think the Cosmic Crisp might be better than a Pink Lady, which I did not expect.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.560]  So it reigns as the best apple?
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.760]  This might be my current favorite apple.
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:23.620]  Wow.
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:24.820]  Wow.
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:26.300]  Wow.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.620]  So better than a six out of ten, then?
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.820]  I think this would be a phenomenal apple juice.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.160]  Good crunch.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.100]  Texture's fine.
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:38.140]  Eric, while Andrew's eating, do you want to talk about the cider that you had?
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:43.400]  Yeah, I went to a brewery in San Diego, and just by happenstance, I can't escape the show,
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.740]  so they had Cosmic Crisp cider.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.360]  And I talked to the bartender, and they said, oh yeah, it's from this one place,
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.660]  and Cosmic Crisp is like, this is like the best one they do,
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.500]  and it's really made with Cosmic Crisp apples.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.140]  And I had it, and it tasted like...
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.420]  I gave it a six out of ten.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.160]  I mean, it tasted like the Cosmic Crisp.
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:01.920]  Was the bartender Peter Storm here?
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.240]  No, unfortunately not.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.920]  You did say that it became a six and a half out of ten after you were done, is that right?
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.080]  It did. When I was done, it went up about half a point.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.240]  I did enjoy it, it's just...
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:17.840]  It wasn't so sugary, which was nice, but also, it's a cider,
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.340]  so it's kind of like, you know, how much do you really want to drink of this?
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:21.420]  That's kind of how I feel.
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.920]  I gotta... I'm going to upgrade my rank from before.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.360]  This is better than an eight.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:30.620]  Wow.
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:33.340]  I'm giving this apple a 9.2.
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.940]  Oh, Jesus.
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.360]  This is a good apple.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.060]  I feel like we did not eat the same apple.
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:40.100]  Oh my God.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.040]  This is a 9.2.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.180]  Okay, 9.2.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.660]  It's better than a Honeycrisp.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:47.200]  I think it's better than a Pink Lady, which was my previous...
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.680]  I think this might be my favorite apple.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:49.960]  Wow.
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:51.080]  That's bold.
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:52.500]  This is... wow.
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.100]  So you ate your two favorite apples in the same podcast?
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.140]  Yeah, I'm going to continue eating. I'm just going to finish both of them.
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:02:59.940]  Well, let me... actually, that's a great point.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.660]  I'm going to take a bite of the Pink Lady now.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.040]  Oh, fuck. I don't know. Actually, hmm.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.720]  He's got terrible apple memory.
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:11.340]  No, it's...
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.080]  It's like an apple goldfish.
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:16.520]  This is also a really good apple.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:17.440]  Hmm.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:21.900]  I don't...
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.200]  This might be...
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.120]  This genuinely might be the LeBron James versus Michael Jordan of apples.
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.720]  Is what we're having right now.
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.700]  These are two all-time greats.
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:32.680]  I don't know how to measure that.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.280]  It's tough.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.700]  They both have different things.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:35.500]  You know what?
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:38.520]  I think we're going to solve this in a year from next week.
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:43.840]  If the Cosmic Crisp holds for one whole year in a fridge, I think it's undeniably the greatest.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:47.600]  Eric wrote, did you mix them up and bite Cosmic Crisp twice?
[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:48.080]  No!
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.480]  How are we to be...
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.000]  I'm making sure... I'm looking at the stickers on both.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.360]  What's the sticker on the Cosmic Crisp?
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.460]  I just peeled it off.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.740]  Where did I put it?
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:00.240]  Oh my god!
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.540]  It's somewhere.
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:02.440]  One sec.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:03.260]  Where did I put it?
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.260]  Did you have bad glue from your sticker?
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:06.200]  No.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.180]  Yeah, I did actually.
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:08.700]  I kind of noticed when I peeled it off.
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:09.460]  They got to work on that.
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.760]  Where did I put the sticker?
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:13.640]  I just literally peeled it off after...
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:15.560]  You know, I was thinking about what happens.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:16.760]  I got it.
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:18.740]  3507?
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:20.360]  3507.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.960]  Oh, different batch.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:22.980]  Different batch.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.040]  Interesting.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.520]  You know what I was thinking?
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:30.920]  We were talking about last week or at some point in the past.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.600]  Inventing our own apple?
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:33.240]  Yeah.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:37.440]  And then some scientist comment leaver really dissuaded me from it.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.280]  It sounded complicated.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.620]  But then I just had an idea.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.440]  I was thinking about this earlier today, actually.
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:43.800]  I almost ate an apple.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.380]  I almost ate a Red Delicious that was in my kitchen.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.880]  And then I was like, yeah, I don't want to.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.120]  And you know what turned me away?
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.580]  I realized I don't like the apple skin.
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:55.900]  That's the only thing that keeps me from an apple.
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:57.140]  Oh, I love the skin.
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:57.360]  Here's my thought.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.780]  For those of us who don't like the skin, I can't be the only one.
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.720]  For those of us who don't like an apple skin,
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:08.200]  someone should invent, maybe it's us, a skinless apple that grows that way.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.180]  You mean an apple that rots on the tree?
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.120]  Well, it wouldn't last a year, but...
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.900]  Hear me out. I got an innovative idea as well.
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.340]  What if we invented a product that could peel an apple?
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:19.580]  What about that?
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.780]  Well, I think that probably exists.
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:23.020]  What if you could run it through and just peel it?
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:23.660]  You've never used one?
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:24.960]  Used what?
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.240]  The apple peeler.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.840]  Who are you talking to?
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.980]  Well, you're saying to invent something, but it already exists.
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.720]  Dad, that was the fucking... I was being sarcastic.
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.400]  You pile of rubbish.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:39.460]  You gotta work on... You gotta... You gotta work on sarcasm.
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:43.260]  What? You don't think I fucking know what an apple peeler is?
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:47.640]  The apple guy? You think the apple guy doesn't know what an apple peeler is?
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:50.100]  Well, it didn't sound like sarcasm.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.880]  I was being facetious.
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:56.700]  You've got outrage down pat, but sarcasm, I'm gonna give you honestly two out of ten.
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.320]  So, Geoff, you're on my side with whether or not that was real?
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:03.120]  Yeah, no, no, for sure. I give him a two out of ten on the sarcasm scale. What do you think?
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:08.900]  How do I... Can I retry it? Can I retry it? I thought it was such a facetious statement.
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.640]  Like, it was so obviously false.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.580]  I mean, I guess I can kind of see that, so I'll give it a two.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.820]  But really, it was just like, I just thought you didn't know what an apple peeler was.
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.760]  Okay, well, let me... How do I... Hmm.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.020]  Maybe it was just really good sarcasm.
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:23.680]  Let me... Yeah, well, I just don't... Hmm.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:23.880]  It's so dry.
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:25.900]  How do I...
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.340]  It's drier than a pink lady.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:28.560]  Alright, take two.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.080]  So, what about this?
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.780]  Nah, that didn't... That just sounded genuine.
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:32.720]  That sounded... I don't know.
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.780]  Do I not know how to be sarcastic?
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:37.360]  How do I be sarcastic?
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:40.800]  No, okay. So, what about this?
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:44.380]  What if...
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.920]  I don't know...
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:46.700]  How do I...
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.580]  Wait. Wait, okay.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:52.320]  Somebody else say it sarcastically, and then I can copy that.
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.460]  Well, Geoff's the king of sarcasm. Go for it.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.600]  What?
[01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:03.130]  I can't stop laughing.
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.840]  How about we invent...
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:09.240]  No.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.780]  Well, I don't...
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.460]  Apple peeler.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:26.620]  That was so fucking great.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.740]  I can't believe that happened.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.200]  That was funny.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.940]  So, things we learned today.
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:42.060]  The F*** Face podcast now is officially a rubbish podcast.
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:43.820]  We no longer say the T-word.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:44.500]  That's not good.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.160]  The T-word...
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:49.420]  The T-word has been stricken from the record.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:53.340]  We know that Cosmic Crisp... Canadian Cosmic Crips...
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.720]  Crisps. I can't say crisps.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.840]  Canadian Cosmic Crips are 9.2 on the tin scale.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:04.260]  And Canadian humans are 2 even on the sarcasm scale.
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:08.700]  Thank you for listening to another episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.480]  You wasted your time, but you did it with us.
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:12.400]  We'll see you next week.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:16.000]  Hey guys, Minor League Fan Jack with a look at next week's episode.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.700]  The gang talks the mummy.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.660]  Andrew has a sushi disaster.
